WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:04.736
CALLEN:
Admiral Chegwidden?

00:04.772 --> 00:06.671
CHEGWIDDEN:
Sterling, lower your weapon,
they're friendlies.

00:06.706 --> 00:07.706
I killed my ex-partner.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.374
He was a dirty cop,

00:09.409 --> 00:11.276
and I shot him
with his own gun.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.145
HETTY:
<i> Detective Whiting is</i>

00:13.180 --> 00:14.279
out of intensive care.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.681
It seems she's going
to pull through.

00:16.716 --> 00:18.283
ERIC:
Clearly Yaniv is taken

00:18.318 --> 00:19.551
with whatever Langston
is pawning.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.620
YANIV:
We got what we need. Kill him.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.422
CALLEN:
Federal agent!

00:23.457 --> 00:25.557
(grunting)

00:25.592 --> 00:27.159
Yaniv!

00:27.194 --> 00:29.161
CALLEN: Yaniv escaped on a road
south of his property.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.395
Find him.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.830
They got my key.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.532
Oh, no, no.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.069
Aw, damn it!

00:37.104 --> 00:38.837
We managed to
rescue Granger

00:38.872 --> 00:42.841
without spending one damn dime
of that ransom money.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.844
It wasn't money,
it was gold.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.313
Those gold bars are worth
a cool $40 million.

00:48.348 --> 00:51.149
Minus the one
I sold to Yaniv.

00:51.184 --> 00:53.552
Mm, and I'm assuming
he has it all now.

00:54.754 --> 00:57.089
Let's go get that gold.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.598
(grunting)

01:06.633 --> 01:08.633
Finally.

01:08.668 --> 01:11.770
Wasn't my fault.
There was an accident.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.607
And that's why you
give yourself a buffer.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.742
Better to be three hours
too soon

01:17.777 --> 01:19.711
than a minute too late.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.879
Shakespeare.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.183
He know a lot about
L.A. traffic, do he?

01:25.519 --> 01:28.454
(motorcycle approaching)

01:31.825 --> 01:34.393
(automatic gunfire)

01:41.668 --> 01:43.435
(automatic gunfire)

02:02.489 --> 02:06.225
(explosion)

02:10.263 --> 02:12.264
¶ ¶

02:30.250 --> 02:31.716
You know,
there's this luxury yacht...

02:31.751 --> 02:33.418
(groans)

02:33.453 --> 02:34.619
...that looks like an island
from, like,

02:34.654 --> 02:36.288
a James Bond villain,

02:36.323 --> 02:38.356
but you can sail it anywhere.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.425
That's a thing?
Yeah, it's a thing.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.460
It's like your own
portable, private,

02:42.495 --> 02:44.763
luxury island yacht.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.899
Oh, well, I can think of
better things to do

02:47.934 --> 02:48.900
with $40 million.

02:48.935 --> 02:49.901
Oh, yeah?
Like what?

02:49.936 --> 02:51.570
I don't know, like,

02:51.605 --> 02:53.338
set up a program
for at-risk teens,

02:53.373 --> 02:54.906
or fight hunger, or...

02:54.941 --> 02:56.341
Buying the Clippers.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.443
I think we're a few
billion short for that.

02:58.478 --> 02:59.411
My turn.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.514
Yeah, but as always,
I have a master plan.

03:02.549 --> 03:03.381
And my master plan involves

03:03.417 --> 03:05.717
turning that $40 million
into billions.

03:05.752 --> 03:08.220
Oh, let me guess,
flipping real estate?

03:08.255 --> 03:10.255
Be just like that couple
on<i> Flip or Flop.</i>

03:10.290 --> 03:11.756
Aren't they divorced?

03:11.791 --> 03:15.327
Yeah, but our love is so much
stronger than their love.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.230
Oh, my gosh.
Jut like our
flipping abilities.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.698
Hold on a second.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.500
This isn't about that
apartment "opportunity"

03:22.535 --> 03:23.534
in the Valley, is it?

03:23.570 --> 03:26.605
Okay, you know what?
That place is literally--

03:26.640 --> 03:29.374
wait for it--
a gold mine.

03:29.409 --> 03:30.909
Yeah, it's a money pit.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.577
It is 20 feet away
from the freeway.

03:32.612 --> 03:33.878
You just don't
have the vision

03:33.913 --> 03:34.879
to see the potential.

03:34.914 --> 03:38.516
Ow. That's because it's clouded
by car exhaust.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.383
Hear that?
(grunts, bones crack)

03:39.419 --> 03:41.019
You know what that is?
(phone rings)

03:41.054 --> 03:42.954
That's the sound of
my dreams being killed.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.322
Ow. Ow.

03:44.357 --> 03:45.624
It's probably
just my mom.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.628
(sighs)

03:54.601 --> 03:55.867
What's up?
Who is it?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.270
Uh, it's Detective Whiting.

03:58.305 --> 04:01.439
She, uh...

04:01.474 --> 04:03.609
She wants to meet up.

04:05.645 --> 04:06.911
What am I supposed
to do with that?

04:06.946 --> 04:07.745
Am I supposed to call her back?

04:07.780 --> 04:12.517
Um, maybe she just wants
to thank you

04:12.552 --> 04:13.785
for saving her life

04:13.820 --> 04:16.354
or something.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.522
Yeah.

04:17.557 --> 04:20.292
Maybe.

04:21.928 --> 04:22.861
I think I got
a better chance

04:22.896 --> 04:24.629
of finding that $40 million
on the sidewalk.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.632
Son of a bitch.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.536
ERIC:
So here's what we know.

04:31.571 --> 04:34.639
Yaniv made off with about
$40 million worth of gold

04:34.674 --> 04:37.008
from Hetty's Heroes'
private arsenal.

04:37.043 --> 04:38.843
Any idea how he moved it?

04:38.878 --> 04:39.777
I've scrubbed through
footage of the area--

04:39.813 --> 04:41.713
so far, nothing.
SAM:
Well, keep looking.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.315
That gold didn't just move
itself.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.683
We're talking about 80 bars.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.018
That's about 2,000 pounds.

04:47.053 --> 04:49.654
So we may be looking
for more than just Yaniv.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.090
Guys, I just got word
of a shootout downtown.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.391
'Caused a massive explosion
and left

04:53.426 --> 04:55.727
at least three people dead.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.429
One of the vehicles involved
belonged to Yaniv.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.064
Any IDs on the bodies?

04:59.099 --> 05:01.499
Not yet. Information's still
trickling in.

05:01.534 --> 05:02.701
All right, let's check out
the crime scene,

05:02.736 --> 05:03.735
see if we can
find anything.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.470
Keep looking.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.778
(indistinct chatter)

05:14.013 --> 05:16.414
SAM: Looks like the name "Yaniv"
and "trouble"

05:16.449 --> 05:17.749
are starting to go together.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.785
(indistinct radio transmission)

05:23.022 --> 05:25.890
Same Chinese symbol
on the helmets.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.694
See what Eric makes of it.
(camera clicks)

05:31.131 --> 05:32.864
This must be Yaniv's man.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.966
(sighs)

05:37.804 --> 05:40.739
Looks like he was
getting rid of evidence.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.873
Evidence of what?

05:41.908 --> 05:43.442
A gold heist?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.880
All right, so the bike
comes done here,

05:48.915 --> 05:52.484
they fire at 'em,
he takes them out.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.453
Second bike comes from behind,

05:55.488 --> 05:57.021
catches him by surprise.

05:57.056 --> 05:58.657
A hit?

05:59.659 --> 06:01.593
Maybe.

06:02.962 --> 06:05.630
Two fuel cans,

06:05.665 --> 06:06.965
two vehicles.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.533
And only one body.

06:08.568 --> 06:11.035
Yaniv had someone else here.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.704
Yeah, well, where is he now?

06:17.076 --> 06:21.613
This wasn't a hit.
It was an extraction.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.181
The only reason
to go after Yaniv's thug

06:23.216 --> 06:25.517
is if you're after
Yaniv and the gold.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.618
If you don't find them,

06:26.653 --> 06:29.154
you take the next best thing.
(hip-hop music playing)

06:29.189 --> 06:30.755
CALLEN: Looks like they're
not the only ones looking.

06:30.790 --> 06:31.856
MAN:
Go, go, man. Go.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.525
SAM:
Lynwood Lords.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.662
The prospect of gold would
get them out of their territory.

06:37.697 --> 06:41.433
Two gangs in one location--
that's no coincidence.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.068
So how would they have
heard about something

06:44.103 --> 06:46.004
that Hetty and others
kept secret for decades?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.779
(sighs loudly)

07:00.153 --> 07:01.619
Still struggling?

07:01.654 --> 07:04.689
Uh, yeah. I feel like
I'm 15 years old again,

07:04.724 --> 07:07.025
except for instead
of homecoming dance,

07:07.060 --> 07:10.762
I have a murder charge
hanging over my head.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.096
I mean, she wouldn't
just text me

07:12.131 --> 07:15.700
if she remembered
my confession, right?

07:15.735 --> 07:17.602
Unless that's what
she wants me to think.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.037
How much does she know?

07:19.072 --> 07:21.806
The whole shebang.
I told her everything.

07:21.841 --> 07:24.242
I mean, whether or not
she was conscious

07:24.277 --> 07:27.078
to process it, that's
a whole nother question,

07:27.113 --> 07:28.814
but I told her everything.

07:31.751 --> 07:32.583
My dad always
used to tell me,

07:32.619 --> 07:35.019
when I had a problem,
he would say,

07:35.054 --> 07:38.957
"Line it up in your sights,

07:38.992 --> 07:40.225
"and then take it out
before it has

07:40.260 --> 07:41.993
a chance to take you out."

07:42.028 --> 07:44.028
Your dad was a gangster.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.865
Also, he probably
would have shot me.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.500
I think he'd love you.

07:49.836 --> 07:52.070
But he's right.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.938
You want me to come with you?

07:53.973 --> 07:55.540
No, I don't want to
wrap you up in this again.

07:55.575 --> 07:57.075
I think I'm just
gonna do it alone.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.811
You're never alone, Deeks.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.148
But also,

08:04.183 --> 08:05.884
please make sure you
come back this time,

08:05.919 --> 08:08.186
because I would hate to have
to break you out of jail

08:08.221 --> 08:10.121
and live the rest
of our lives on the lam.

08:13.259 --> 08:15.727
Is it crazy if I say that sounds
pretty awesome right now?

08:15.762 --> 08:17.062
(chuckles)

08:18.898 --> 08:22.133
Just you and I,
open road.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.102
Eating street tacos.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.838
Lots of ice cream,
robbing banks.

08:29.242 --> 08:32.243
I love you so much.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.079
I love you, too.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.583
All right, wish me luck.
(keys beeping)

08:38.618 --> 08:40.585
Good luck.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.186
(line ringing)

08:42.221 --> 08:43.889
(clears throat)

08:47.894 --> 08:49.794
Whiting.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.764
Hey, it's Deeks.

08:58.671 --> 09:00.738
Good luck.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.707
What was that about?

09:02.742 --> 09:03.942
Had to answer
some questions

09:03.977 --> 09:07.045
for the D.A.'s office
about my incident

09:07.080 --> 09:08.279
at the pawnshop.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.681
Alleged incident.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.651
Good thing you got
a solid lawyer on retainer.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.119
Yeah, well, the D.A.'s not the
only one looking for answers.

09:15.154 --> 09:16.821
Yeah, we just left
a multiple homicide.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.824
Gang shot up an underpass.
LANGSTON: Crazy.

09:19.859 --> 09:23.895
L.A.'s dark side
rearing its ugly head.

09:23.930 --> 09:27.332
Mm, what's really crazy is that
two of Yaniv's men were there.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.135
It was almost like the gang
knew about the gold.

09:31.971 --> 09:35.740
You two are about as subtle
as a massive coronary.

09:35.775 --> 09:38.843
CHEGWIDDEN: We were worried
that Yaniv might move the gold

09:38.878 --> 09:39.644
across the border
into Mexico,

09:39.679 --> 09:41.112
so we put word out
on the street

09:41.147 --> 09:42.380
what he was carrying.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.948
Unbelievable.

09:43.983 --> 09:45.149
LANGSTON:
What do you mean?

09:45.184 --> 09:47.118
It'll force Yaniv
to hunker down,

09:47.153 --> 09:48.886
giving us enough
time to find him.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.856
And every gang, criminal
and wannabe in L.A.

09:51.891 --> 09:54.258
will be on a scavenger hunt
that'll tear up the city.

09:54.293 --> 09:57.662
Sounds like everything's
going according to plan.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.509
Where's Deeks?

10:11.545 --> 10:13.911
He's putting some old business
to rest with Whiting.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.081
In the meantime, we need
to figure out Yaniv's next move.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.350
$40 million in gold?
I mean, forget a turf war.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.952
That could start a real war.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.321
Every gang in the city
is gonna be gunning for Yaniv.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.189
There's no way we can cover
that much ground.

10:25.224 --> 10:26.257
My God, what were these guys
thinking?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.226
I don't think they were.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.694
We got to find Yaniv

10:29.729 --> 10:31.062
before those gangs do.

10:31.097 --> 10:32.864
So who's gonna keep
an eye on them?

10:33.866 --> 10:35.299
We are.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.103
Really?

10:40.106 --> 10:42.073
What's the problem?

10:42.108 --> 10:44.308
Thanks to us, Yaniv
is gonna hide the gold

10:44.343 --> 10:46.210
and hole up till
things cool off.

10:46.245 --> 10:47.378
All we have to do
is track him down.

10:47.413 --> 10:50.214
With all due respect, that
is a very risky assumption.

10:50.249 --> 10:51.849
CHEGWIDDEN:
Trust us.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.251
We were doing
covert field operations

10:53.286 --> 10:56.054
when all three of you
were in diapers.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.157
LANGSTON: Yaniv has to rely
on people he trusts,

10:59.192 --> 11:01.359
and he's already down
several men.

11:01.394 --> 11:05.129
We got to find him before he
buys a small army of protection.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.732
Any legit firm will want to know
what they're protecting.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.000
Well, and any
underground force

11:09.035 --> 11:10.201
is probably gonna
want to rob him.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.904
Well, still, it makes sense
to find out if he made the call.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.806
All right.
Eric.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.442
You've reached
the Bealectric company.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.444
Look into the major players
in private security,

11:19.479 --> 11:22.180
see if anyone reached out
for a large confidential job

11:22.215 --> 11:23.314
in the last 24 hours.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.315
Copy that.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.384
Oh, we've also made
some IDs from the shootout.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.753
Yaniv's dead man
is David Belle.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.755
Yeah, the car's registered
to an Asher Groves,

11:30.790 --> 11:32.056
another associate of Yaniv's.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.425
It looks like he was the one
who was taken.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.359
ERIC:
And the symbol

11:35.395 --> 11:37.729
on the bikers' helmets
is pronounced "Ciké."

11:37.764 --> 11:40.031
It means "assassins"
in Chinese.

11:40.066 --> 11:43.167
It's used
by the Xionshou Song.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.335
Oh, boy.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.904
Something we should know about?

11:46.939 --> 11:48.106
(Kensi sighs)

11:48.141 --> 11:49.474
Xionshou is not
your average gang.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.075
They're a real deal
crime syndicate

11:51.110 --> 11:52.844
that basically
deals in brutality.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.212
Straight killers.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.048
ERIC: Their main base
of operations is supposedly

11:57.083 --> 11:58.449
a restaurant in Chinatown.

11:58.484 --> 11:59.517
We'll stake out Chinatown,

11:59.552 --> 12:02.120
see if we can find out
where Xionshou took Asher.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.121
All right, I'll hit
the pawnshop,

12:03.156 --> 12:03.988
see if there's any evidence

12:04.024 --> 12:05.890
that can tell us
where Yaniv is headed.

12:05.925 --> 12:08.025
SAM:
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.027
Time out. Where you going?

12:10.062 --> 12:12.029
Well, that gold ain't
gonna find itself.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.431
Not so fast.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.032
It has become
painfully obvious

12:15.067 --> 12:16.801
that the three of you cannot
be trusted on your own,

12:16.836 --> 12:19.104
so... Sam?

12:20.139 --> 12:22.207
I'll take Bridges.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.410
All right. Admiral Chegwidden,
you're with me.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.314
Leaves you and me, Langston.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.016
Oh, no,
this is not gonna happen.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.150
Look, you can either
do it our way,

12:33.186 --> 12:34.919
or you can spend the day
reaching out to your contacts

12:34.954 --> 12:36.755
trying to get out of our lockup.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.091
Fine. Keep up, young lady.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.325
Oh, geez.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.527
That goes double for you.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.763
No.

13:01.013 --> 13:01.979
(grunts)

13:02.014 --> 13:03.014
Whiting.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.115
Deeks.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.149
(sighs)

13:05.184 --> 13:07.351
Glad you came.
Oh.

13:07.386 --> 13:11.255
I won't lie,
I was surprised when you said

13:11.290 --> 13:14.525
you wanted to meet, 'cause the
last I heard, I was bad luck.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.028
Yeah. And I'm still not
convinced you aren't.

13:19.565 --> 13:22.567
But I might not be sitting here
today if you hadn't been there.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.735
You helped me hang on.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.370
Oh, come on, I did what anyone
would do in that situation.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.338
No...

13:27.373 --> 13:30.174
I'm not too big to
admit when I was wrong.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.009
Sorry I doubted you.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.482
All right, let's...

13:38.517 --> 13:40.885
let's consider it
water under the bridge, then.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.422
And I was really happy to hear
that you found Kensi safe.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.924
How is she?

13:46.926 --> 13:48.459
She's good.

13:50.463 --> 13:55.266
I mean, actually,
she's, she's great.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.068
Thank you.

13:58.070 --> 14:01.072
I can only imagine.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.374
You two have been
through a lot this year.

14:03.409 --> 14:06.411
Yeah, you're telling me.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.380
You got time for
a cup of coffee?

14:10.416 --> 14:12.884
Um...

14:12.919 --> 14:14.018
Come on.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.586
Least I can do,

14:15.621 --> 14:18.189
after all the sludge you
drank at the precinct.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.192
(laughs) Yeah, nothing
is gonna undo that damage,

14:21.227 --> 14:25.997
but you know,
I'm not gonna turn down, uh,

14:26.032 --> 14:28.399
offer for free bean juice.

14:28.434 --> 14:29.901
You are buying, right?

14:29.936 --> 14:32.103
Of course.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.138
(door opens)

14:45.151 --> 14:46.117
(footfalls approaching)

14:46.152 --> 14:48.352
Okay. Next time
you ditch someone,

14:48.387 --> 14:50.288
make sure they can't
catch an Uber.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.291
About time you got here.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.995
(Spanish hip-hop song
playing)

14:59.265 --> 15:01.032
Okay, you know what?
Let's just hurry this up

15:01.067 --> 15:02.667
before your little plan
gets us both killed.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.602
And what are we doing-- are
we executing a search warrant,

15:04.637 --> 15:06.204
or having a yard sale? What?

15:07.707 --> 15:09.507
You'll see.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.075
No, no, no, no.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.977
Don't smirk at me.
You stole my car.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.612
You don't get to smirk at me.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.414
(exhales)

15:16.449 --> 15:19.116
Safe's over here.

15:19.151 --> 15:21.052
What safe?

15:23.289 --> 15:24.989
Ah. That safe.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.059
(sighs)

15:28.094 --> 15:30.394
And what is that?

15:30.429 --> 15:32.363
A key.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.332
Our search warrant
is for Yaniv's home,

15:34.367 --> 15:38.002
or place of business,
which makes this safe fair game.

15:38.037 --> 15:40.939
Regardless of how
we get into it.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.442
You might want to stand back.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.453
(low chatter)

16:06.265 --> 16:07.164
Mm.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.034
Sam, please tell me
you have something.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.570
Uh, it's pretty quiet
on this side.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.638
We should just pull
a Da Nang Pickup.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.208
Drive in, throw one of them
in the trunk, peel out.

16:17.243 --> 16:19.076
Ten seconds, tops.

16:19.111 --> 16:22.480
We're federal agents,
not the Mafia.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.187
(gasps)

16:30.222 --> 16:32.590
(sighs)

16:32.625 --> 16:33.758
So what's your deal?

16:33.793 --> 16:35.393
Oh, come on, come on.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.660
We're gonna be
sitting here for a while,

16:36.695 --> 16:38.262
we might as well
get to know each other.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.730
Focus.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.199
We have work to do.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.235
(sighs)
And don't touch me.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.603
Ever.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.141
You got anything to eat?

16:50.176 --> 16:53.544
This is a stakeout,
not a picnic.

16:53.579 --> 16:54.411
I didn't have breakfast.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.347
It's really not
the most important meal

16:56.382 --> 16:58.249
of the day.
That's a rumor.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.551
They're all important,
if you've got low blood sugar.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.520
And cancer.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.687
You don't have cancer.

17:03.722 --> 17:04.755
Well, not yet.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.624
But the way things are going.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.692
Oh, man.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.361
Listen. There's a dim sum place
around the corner.

17:10.396 --> 17:13.330
Grab yourself a pork bun
or something.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.700
I don't eat pork.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.770
Then ask for chicken.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.542
I don't have any money.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.511
(laughs softly)

17:27.546 --> 17:29.514
You're a grown man.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.516
Cool.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.118
You want anything?

17:34.153 --> 17:35.853
A receipt.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.422
And make it quick. I'll
leave you if I have to.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.258
You know, you might feel better
if you ate something.

17:41.293 --> 17:42.793
(sighs)

17:42.828 --> 17:44.228
Okay.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.264
Suit yourself.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.835
G, please tell me
you have something.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.071
CALLEN:
I wish.

18:03.315 --> 18:06.384
You don't like it, then you
should've driven your car.

18:07.620 --> 18:11.288
Letting you drive was my way
of extending an olive branch.

18:11.323 --> 18:13.457
I'm starting to think
I made a mistake.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.826
This baby's perfect
for a stakeout.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.461
It's inconspicuous,

18:17.496 --> 18:20.297
and you don't have to care
what happens to it.

18:20.332 --> 18:24.401
There was this one time,
we're pulling an all-nighter.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.403
Target shows, I toss
him in the back.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.439
And Obi-Wan floors it.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.808
And next thing you know,
we're doing 90 on the freeway.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.210
But this guy's not talking.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.478
Thinks he's tough.

18:34.513 --> 18:38.482
So Obi jams the accelerator
with a shotgun

18:38.517 --> 18:40.751
and climbs in back with us.

18:40.786 --> 18:44.155
Starts singing
"The Show Must Go On."

18:44.190 --> 18:48.792
The guy freaks out, and tells
us everything we want to know.

18:48.827 --> 18:50.427
Problem is,

18:50.462 --> 18:52.930
Obi's having trouble getting
back to the driver's seat,

18:52.965 --> 18:54.431
and the car's
starting to swerve.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.334
Next thing I know,
we're upside down in a river,

18:57.369 --> 18:59.303
laughing our asses off.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.605
Obi Wan.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.207
Who the hell was this guy?

19:03.242 --> 19:04.341
What?

19:04.376 --> 19:06.544
Obi Wan?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.381
Owen.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.851
Granger?

19:13.886 --> 19:15.786
Yes.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.689
He was always pulling stuff
like that.

19:18.724 --> 19:21.292
Doesn't sound like
the Granger I know.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.826
(laughs)

19:22.861 --> 19:24.929
There was this one time,

19:24.964 --> 19:27.865
at a brothel in Hoi An,
and, uh...

19:27.900 --> 19:30.935
CALLEN: Sam. I got eyes
on one of our Xionshou guys.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.505
CALLEN:
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.607
Sam, we got a problem.

19:36.642 --> 19:38.275
You stay here.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.578
Showtime.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.747
(Langston laughs)

19:47.519 --> 19:49.286
(grunting)

19:49.321 --> 19:50.288
SAM:
Federal agent!

20:08.707 --> 20:10.507
(tires screeching)

20:10.542 --> 20:11.609
(people exclaiming)

20:11.644 --> 20:12.876
(Langston laughs)

20:12.911 --> 20:15.646
That's why you have
a stakeout car.

20:15.681 --> 20:16.914
(groans)

20:18.450 --> 20:20.284
Yep.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.386
This was definitely a mistake.

20:22.421 --> 20:23.554
Wouldn't have come to this
if you'd just pulled

20:23.589 --> 20:24.655
a Da Nang Pickup.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.290
That's what I said.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.459
You also said you were going
to get something to eat.

20:28.494 --> 20:29.827
Did I?
Yeah.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.762
I forget sometimes.
You know, I'm old.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.430
(Bridges panting)

20:33.465 --> 20:36.533
He dropped this.
You guys like gadgets, right?

20:36.568 --> 20:37.968
Here you go.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.703
LANGSTON:
You can Snappletweet us,

20:39.738 --> 20:42.573
(Bridges grunts)
while we do the real work.

20:42.608 --> 20:43.807
(groans)
Just drag him.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.376
We can't drag him
from this end.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.844
I'm hurting my back, man.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.480
Promise me
you will shoot me

20:49.515 --> 20:50.881
before we turn
into that.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.783
Only if you
do the same.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.285
You got a deal.

21:05.664 --> 21:08.365
Well, it's only a matter of time
before we're able to place you

21:08.400 --> 21:09.767
at the scene of the shootout.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.369
This is where it goes from
bad to life in prison.

21:12.404 --> 21:13.170
You understand?

21:13.205 --> 21:14.538
LANGSTON:
Start with his thumbs.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.607
SAM: Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
CALLEN:
What are you doing? Whoa.

21:16.642 --> 21:17.708
SAM: Bridges, Bridges.
Hey, hey!

21:17.743 --> 21:19.777
Where'd you take Asher, punk?
What the hell, man?!

21:19.812 --> 21:21.412
Where'd you take him?!
Bridges, enough!

21:21.447 --> 21:22.746
This is a country mile
from enough.

21:22.781 --> 21:23.981
BRIDGES: Hey!
CALLEN: You, too. Let's go.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.053
(Bridges panting,
Langston laughs)

21:31.123 --> 21:32.890
Beautiful.
(chuckles)

21:32.925 --> 21:33.924
Mm.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.660
How long before
we go back in?

21:36.695 --> 21:37.995
Excuse me?

21:38.030 --> 21:39.096
We're just getting warmed up.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.998
Great work in there.
Very believable.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.000
There's not a chance in hell
you two are going back in there.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.435
What's the problem?

21:44.470 --> 21:45.803
You said we could
take a crack at him.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.339
Said take a crack at him,
not crack his head open.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.840
Clearly your way wasn't working.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.675
Yeah, just wasted an hour
blabbing away.

21:51.710 --> 21:54.378
Our way doesn't violate
his civil rights.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.916
When did the Navy turn into
a bunch of flower children?

21:58.951 --> 22:01.052
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear you say that.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.391
Clearly we're not getting
anywhere with this guy.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.893
But finding Asher's our best
lead to Yaniv and the gold.

22:09.928 --> 22:12.029
So what do
we do now?

22:12.064 --> 22:15.532
We hope Kensi and Chegwidden
get something from the pawnshop

22:15.567 --> 22:18.502
or the twins can work some magic
on this guy's phone.

22:18.537 --> 22:20.471
¶ The USB's connected to the ¶

22:20.506 --> 22:21.939
¶ Cell phone ¶

22:21.974 --> 22:23.741
¶ The cell phone's
connected to... ¶
(computer beeps)

22:23.776 --> 22:24.775
Ooh.

22:25.711 --> 22:26.677
Nell?

22:26.712 --> 22:28.545
Hmm?
Ask me what time it is.

22:28.580 --> 22:29.947
I know what time
it is.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.648
I have a watch,
a phone,

22:31.683 --> 22:33.650
a tablet, and if I can
see the sun's position

22:33.685 --> 22:34.818
in the sky...
Humor me.

22:34.853 --> 22:35.819
(sighs)

22:35.854 --> 22:36.954
What time is it?
Uh.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.423
(phone beeps, mouths "Now")

22:39.458 --> 22:41.925
What time is it?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.160
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The time is 11:50 a.m.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.428
Now,

22:44.463 --> 22:47.431
all I have to do is
tap the answer

22:47.466 --> 22:48.766
to bring me to
the world clock...

22:48.801 --> 22:50.567
Mm-hmm.
...add a location,

22:50.602 --> 22:52.503
type something,

22:52.538 --> 22:53.837
copy it,

22:53.872 --> 22:55.973
send the clipboard
to a message,

22:56.008 --> 22:58.642
cancel the message...
Hmm.

22:58.677 --> 22:59.643
<i> ...et</i> voilà.

22:59.678 --> 23:00.711
We are in.

23:00.746 --> 23:01.979
NELL:
Impressive.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.447
It's an old exploit,

23:03.482 --> 23:05.015
but it only checks out if you...

23:05.050 --> 23:07.651
BOTH: ...never update
your operating system.

23:07.686 --> 23:08.752
Hey.
A valuable lesson to us all.

23:08.787 --> 23:13.023
So, what fan-tabulous prizes
do we walk away with, Rod?

23:13.058 --> 23:14.525
(announcer voice):
Well, Bob...

23:14.560 --> 23:16.126
(typing on keyboard)

23:16.161 --> 23:18.462
...a whole bunch of aliases,
and no full names.

23:18.497 --> 23:21.198
Oh, great,
I will call Callen.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.100
(phone rings)

23:23.135 --> 23:24.535
Any luck?

23:24.570 --> 23:26.537
Well, the phone's itself
is entirely devoid

23:26.572 --> 23:27.738
of incriminating evidence.

23:27.773 --> 23:29.606
BRIDGES: Doesn't sound
like good news.

23:29.641 --> 23:31.008
Doesn't sound
like news at all.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.643
NELL:
Well, we're getting there.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.878
He probably only uses it
for specific reasons,

23:34.913 --> 23:37.748
like contacting members
of the Xionshou Song network.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.883
And if we locate a cluster
of these numbers,

23:39.918 --> 23:41.585
that might tell us
where Asher's being held.

23:41.620 --> 23:42.620
Mm-hmm.

23:43.822 --> 23:45.155
And... boom.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.024
Looks like a derelict
theater downtown.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.792
Impressive.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.027
For code monkeys.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.496
LANGSTON: But how do we know
they have Asher?

23:52.531 --> 23:54.164
I've set up a program
that hacks into

23:54.199 --> 23:55.799
their microphones and cameras.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.035
And footage should
be coming online now.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.573
ERIC: This is a live feed
from their phones.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.611
That's Asher.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.112
Send us the address,
we're on the move.

24:09.147 --> 24:10.748
ERIC:
Yeah.

24:13.519 --> 24:15.786
I just kept thinking
about my son.

24:15.821 --> 24:16.854
My husband.

24:16.889 --> 24:20.624
I came so close
to losing everything.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.759
I've actually had the...

24:22.794 --> 24:25.796
"lying in your own pool
of blood" moment, so I get it.

24:26.865 --> 24:29.700
I also nearly caused you
to lose Kensi.

24:29.735 --> 24:32.269
No, no, you didn't,
that psycho Ferris did.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.271
I mean, obviously,
it'd have been nice

24:34.306 --> 24:36.173
if you would've come around
sooner, but that stubbornness

24:36.208 --> 24:37.708
is what makes you a good cop,

24:37.743 --> 24:39.977
so....

24:40.012 --> 24:41.044
Thank you.

24:41.079 --> 24:42.813
Well, it's true.

24:43.849 --> 24:45.649
Which brings me to why

24:45.684 --> 24:46.984
I really asked you
out here today.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.719
Right.

24:49.755 --> 24:52.155
Things at the precinct
have been tense.

24:52.190 --> 24:54.591
We have more open I.A. cases
than ever before,

24:54.626 --> 24:58.228
and worse, I'm hearing rumors
of more not being reported.

24:58.263 --> 25:01.098
So what-what are we...
what are we talking about here?

25:01.133 --> 25:04.268
We talking about...
corruption at the precinct?

25:05.737 --> 25:07.538
Your old Lieutenant Bates'
name popped up.

25:07.573 --> 25:09.273
Bates?
I don't know if I should
take it seriously,

25:09.308 --> 25:11.709
but there's concern.

25:13.745 --> 25:15.913
Yeah, no, I mean...

25:15.948 --> 25:18.516
we should definitely
take that seriously.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.120
(torch hissing)

25:24.156 --> 25:26.590
Well, finally.

25:26.625 --> 25:29.927
You have to take your time or
things kind of burn up in there.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.261
You want to give it a crack?

25:31.296 --> 25:33.297
Don't mind if I do.

25:34.666 --> 25:35.899
(clears throat)
Right there.

25:35.934 --> 25:36.967
Yeah, I know.

25:43.141 --> 25:44.341
Ooh, hello.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.276
(sighs)

25:46.311 --> 25:47.711
Let's see what
we're working with here.

25:47.746 --> 25:48.712
All right.

25:48.747 --> 25:51.915
Got cash,

25:51.950 --> 25:52.916
bunch of...

25:52.951 --> 25:54.117
pawn records.

25:54.152 --> 25:55.586
CHEGWIDDEN:
Some jewelry.

25:55.621 --> 25:56.587
KENSI:
Ooh.

25:56.622 --> 25:59.623
What do we have
here? Hold on.

25:59.658 --> 26:01.592
Got a Harry Zanetti letterhead.

26:01.627 --> 26:03.160
CHEGWIDDEN: Contact information,
"Mallory Fletcher."

26:03.195 --> 26:04.861
That ring a bell?

26:04.896 --> 26:07.698
No, but he obviously thinks
that it's safe worthy.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.032
(phone line ringing)

26:09.067 --> 26:10.066
NELL:
Yeah, Kens?

26:10.102 --> 26:12.703
Hey, Nell, could you run
down a Mallory Fletcher

26:12.738 --> 26:14.271
from Lindenmere
Assets for us?

26:14.306 --> 26:15.706
(typing on keyboard)

26:15.741 --> 26:18.609
NELL:
Okay.

26:18.644 --> 26:20.644
Looks like Lindenmere Assets
is a hedge fund downtown,

26:20.679 --> 26:22.279
and Fletcher is a manager.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.014
I'm running her background now

26:24.049 --> 26:25.649
and I'll send you
their address.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.250
All right, thanks.
Serious money in hedge funds.

26:27.285 --> 26:28.051
Yep.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.953
Hell of a way to
wash $40 million.

26:29.988 --> 26:32.322
Yeah.

26:32.357 --> 26:34.625
Let's pay Ms. Fletcher
a visit.

26:34.660 --> 26:35.659
KENSI:
Let's.

26:45.671 --> 26:47.004
Looks like another
gang took your bait.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.889
It's like a trail
of bread crumbs,

27:05.924 --> 27:07.224
except with
dead bodies.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.626
Shh.

27:30.015 --> 27:32.149
Looks like the Latinos
lost the battle.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.652
And the war.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.925
CALLEN:
Sam, what the hell is that?

27:41.960 --> 27:44.128
SAM: G, you got to get back here
and see this.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.944
CALLEN:
Is that Asher?

28:00.979 --> 28:03.681
SAM:
Yeah, they showed him no mercy.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.051
Damn.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.965
Looks like he was already dead
before the fighting started.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.500
Which means they got
what they wanted.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.102
Yaniv's location.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.138
Eric, please tell us
you have some good news.

28:28.173 --> 28:29.806
ERIC:
Actually, I do.

28:29.841 --> 28:31.308
I got the rest
of the Xionshou Song

28:31.343 --> 28:32.876
headed south on Alameda.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.077
Talk us to them.

28:34.112 --> 28:35.746
Alert LAPD, we need
to contain this.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.881
Why call backup when you got
the dream team right here?

28:39.050 --> 28:41.385
More like the Bad News Bears.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.826
(low conversations)

28:49.861 --> 28:50.994
CHEGWIDDEN:
Smell that?

28:51.029 --> 28:52.429
No, what?

28:52.464 --> 28:53.864
Greed.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.265
(laughs)

28:55.300 --> 28:57.000
Not into the market?

28:57.035 --> 28:58.935
Not into investment
strategies only accessible

28:58.970 --> 29:00.036
to the super rich.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.839
I hear you, my partner
thinks that flipping houses

29:02.874 --> 29:04.407
is the way to go.

29:04.442 --> 29:05.742
Yeah.
WOMAN:
I hear what you're saying.

29:05.777 --> 29:08.779
She's right over there.
Still, this isn't exactly
unexpected.

29:08.814 --> 29:11.515
Look, the risk was accounted
for in the prospectus.

29:11.550 --> 29:14.284
Now's not the time
to change strategies.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.787
Thanks. Talk soon.

29:17.823 --> 29:19.022
Mallory Fletcher.

29:19.057 --> 29:20.490
Special Agent
Kensi Blye, NCIS.

29:20.525 --> 29:22.259
Special Agent
Chegwidden.

29:22.294 --> 29:25.162
MALLORY:
How can I help you?

29:25.197 --> 29:30.233
Do you know a man named
Yaniv Kornberg?

29:30.268 --> 29:31.568
As a matter of fact, I do.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.203
He runs a pawnshop
in Hollywood.

29:33.238 --> 29:34.304
He was just
here yesterday.

29:34.339 --> 29:35.806
How do you know him?

29:35.841 --> 29:37.307
Yaniv's lawyer Harry Zanetti
made the connection.

29:37.342 --> 29:39.342
Yaniv was in a jam
and needed to cash in

29:39.377 --> 29:41.011
on some gold he inherited.

29:41.046 --> 29:42.345
That gold was stolen.

29:42.380 --> 29:44.114
KENSI:
We're gonna need the contact

29:44.149 --> 29:45.549
of the person
that purchased the bar.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.918
Easy enough.

29:47.953 --> 29:48.919
It was me.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.554
He offered it
for $250,000,

29:50.589 --> 29:52.889
about half its value.

29:52.924 --> 29:54.558
You didn't think
that was a red flag?

29:54.593 --> 29:57.561
Maybe, but it was
too good to pass up.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.496
Did, uh, Yaniv mention
what he was planning

29:59.531 --> 30:01.231
on doing with the money?

30:01.266 --> 30:02.899
What anyone does on
the other side of my deals

30:02.934 --> 30:05.068
is none of my business.
KENSI: Mm.

30:06.404 --> 30:08.471
See, right now you're only
guilty of bad judgment.

30:08.506 --> 30:09.672
But if we find out

30:09.707 --> 30:12.309
that you're an accessory...
(inhales sharply)
Okay.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.611
Okay.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.147
Yaniv was looking
to charter a luxury yacht.

30:17.182 --> 30:19.482
Figured he wanted to
party with his new money.

30:19.517 --> 30:22.419
I offered to invest it for him,
but my guess is he blows it all.

30:22.454 --> 30:23.620
So where's the gold?

30:23.655 --> 30:26.223
What assurances do I have
that my money will be returned

30:26.258 --> 30:27.858
when it's recovered?

30:27.893 --> 30:29.226
I think you're pretty lucky
right now

30:29.261 --> 30:31.061
that you're not walking out
of here in cuffs.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.964
Knew it was too good to be true.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.402
(cabinet unlocks)

30:40.005 --> 30:41.972
(beeps)

30:42.007 --> 30:43.874
(latch unlocks)

30:49.915 --> 30:53.951
Oh.
27.42 pounds.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.521
Most expensive free weight
I've ever held.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.523
Thank you.

31:00.558 --> 31:02.659
KENSI:
<i> Hey, Eric.</i>

31:02.694 --> 31:04.561
Yaniv monetized a quarter
million dollars of the gold.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.129
He also may have
chartered a yacht.

31:06.164 --> 31:07.464
We need you to
track him down.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.266
ERIC:
I'm on it.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.001
How you feeling about your
friend hunkering down now?

31:11.036 --> 31:12.335
He's not out
of the country yet.

31:12.370 --> 31:15.005
For your sake, let's hope not.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.009
DEEKS:
<i> I mean, don't get me wrong,</i>

31:19.044 --> 31:22.512
I love a good stroll as much
as the next guy, but why me?

31:22.547 --> 31:24.247
Well, because
I need your help.

31:24.282 --> 31:25.949
As hard as it is to admit,

31:25.984 --> 31:28.218
you may be the only one
I can trust right now.

31:28.253 --> 31:29.686
What kind of help
you looking for?

31:29.721 --> 31:30.854
I don't know yet.

31:30.889 --> 31:34.257
But I need to know if I can
trust you when the time comes.

31:34.292 --> 31:36.559
And before you answer,

31:36.594 --> 31:38.561
you should probably
keep in mind your confession

31:38.596 --> 31:40.297
to killing Boyle.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.266
(sighs)

31:44.302 --> 31:45.702
And there it is.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.171
While I don't agree
with what you did,

31:48.206 --> 31:51.174
I do think you did it
for the right reasons.

31:51.209 --> 31:54.177
I'm willing to close
the investigation.

31:54.212 --> 31:56.980
If you help me.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.118
I mean, I don't have much
of a choice, then, do I?

32:02.153 --> 32:05.322
Depends on how much you like
being on the wrong side of I.A.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.123
(inhales sharply)

32:07.158 --> 32:11.027
You know, you could've
led with that, right?

32:11.062 --> 32:14.230
(scoffs) And miss
watching you sweat it out?

32:14.265 --> 32:16.499
Wow, there's the Whiting
that I know and love.

32:16.534 --> 32:19.102
Sorry. Old habits.
Yeah.

32:19.137 --> 32:21.604
So, what, you just
hold this over my head

32:21.639 --> 32:23.340
for the rest
of my career?

32:23.375 --> 32:25.542
Something like that.

32:27.345 --> 32:30.247
But hopefully, now you know
you can trust me, too.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.461
ERIC: Guys, I got
the Xionshou Song at a house

32:44.496 --> 32:45.729
50 yards from your location.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.131
You should have a visual.
(men arguing)

32:49.534 --> 32:51.267
(men arguing in Chinese)

32:51.302 --> 32:53.703
Something's got
their panties in a bunch.

32:53.738 --> 32:55.238
CALLEN:
I don't see Yaniv.

32:55.273 --> 32:57.240
We're about to lose
the element of surprise.

32:57.275 --> 32:59.042
No, we're not. We go now.

32:59.077 --> 33:02.512
SAM:
Three, two, one.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.247
Federal agents!

33:04.282 --> 33:05.448
CALLEN:
On the ground!

33:05.483 --> 33:06.282
Now!

33:06.317 --> 33:08.084
LANGSTON: Hands
where we can see them.

33:08.119 --> 33:09.753
BRIDGES:
Go ahead.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.388
Give me a reason.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.997
It's just like Khe Sanh,
huh, Langston?

33:22.233 --> 33:23.800
CALLEN:
Clear.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.168
Clear.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.406
No Yaniv.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.141
No gold.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.276
SAM: Eric, see if you can
access the camera

33:33.311 --> 33:35.211
on the street here
and pick up Yaniv.

33:35.246 --> 33:36.513
ERIC:
On it.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.148
We've also found the private
yacht Yaniv chartered.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.417
CALLEN:
Where is it leaving from?

33:40.452 --> 33:42.552
Long Beach and that's not all.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.687
Yaniv's also chartered
a cargo plane,

33:44.722 --> 33:48.558
two private train cars and
four semi trucks, all for today.

33:48.593 --> 33:51.494
And that's just what we found
so far. They keep coming.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.297
Could take forever to track
all them, even if we split up.

33:54.332 --> 33:55.498
It's risky
on Yaniv's part, though.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.168
He's got to know there's a
chance we hit the right charter.

33:58.203 --> 34:02.305
Or... this is a smokescreen.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.840
What do you do
if you got to

34:03.875 --> 34:05.842
move gold, but you know
all your outs are covered?

34:05.877 --> 34:08.411
If you can't get the gold
out to the buyer,

34:08.446 --> 34:11.448
you bring the buyer
in to the gold.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.516
Exactly. If that's the case,
we have no way of knowing

34:13.551 --> 34:15.652
who we're looking for
or where they're arriving from.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.253
It's a good plan.

34:17.288 --> 34:18.755
Yeah, if we don't
figure it out quickly,

34:18.790 --> 34:21.058
it's gonna be
a successful one.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.304
ERIC: Guys, I got access
to the street cameras.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.506
Yaniv is moving
in an armored car.

34:36.541 --> 34:37.707
The Xionshou Song
just missed him.

34:37.742 --> 34:38.842
Where is it now?

34:38.877 --> 34:41.244
Ugh, we lost it
in a dead zone,

34:41.279 --> 34:42.645
but we have bigger problems.

34:42.680 --> 34:44.481
We're now looking into incoming

34:44.516 --> 34:45.749
private flights.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.718
We're even filtering for flights
scheduled for the last 24 hours,

34:48.753 --> 34:50.587
but there's just
too much ground to cover.

34:50.622 --> 34:52.622
We have to narrow
the field.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.324
Out of all the houses
in the city,

34:54.359 --> 34:55.492
Yaniv felt it was safe enough

34:55.527 --> 34:57.560
to bring the gold
to this one. Why?

34:57.595 --> 34:59.596
He must not have had
a personal connection to it.

34:59.631 --> 35:00.830
Otherwise, the gang members

35:00.865 --> 35:02.398
would've found
him here sooner.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.634
Nell, what can you tell us
about this property?

35:04.669 --> 35:05.635
(typing)

35:05.670 --> 35:07.470
NELL: Uh, okay.
It looks like

35:07.505 --> 35:09.672
it was foreclosed on
a couple months ago.

35:09.707 --> 35:13.810
Then it was picked up by a Reho
Real Estate for their portfolio.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.712
Any connection
between Yaniv and Reho?

35:15.747 --> 35:16.813
Not that I can find.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.648
Interesting.

35:18.683 --> 35:22.352
Guess what hedge fund
Reho's CEO is invested in.

35:23.221 --> 35:24.687
Mallory Fletcher's.

35:24.722 --> 35:26.523
NELL: Bingo.
SAM: She probably gave up

35:26.558 --> 35:28.191
one gold bar because
she gets a bigger commission

35:28.226 --> 35:29.325
on the whole deal.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.361
Cross-reference
that charter list

35:31.396 --> 35:33.296
with Mallory's client list,
will you?

35:33.331 --> 35:35.165
Cross-referencing...

35:35.200 --> 35:37.233
jackpot.

35:37.268 --> 35:38.368
Eduardo Barbosa.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.736
He's a Brazilian
millionaire.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.205
He's on a flight
into Burbank Airport.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.207
That's where Yaniv
is handing off the gold.

35:44.242 --> 35:45.408
Let's go.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.809
BRIDGES:
Right behind you.

35:46.844 --> 35:48.745
You two are staying here.

35:48.780 --> 35:49.913
The hell we are.

35:49.948 --> 35:51.347
That wasn't the deal.

35:51.382 --> 35:52.415
We didn't have a deal.

35:52.450 --> 35:53.950
Eric,

35:53.985 --> 35:56.653
have Kensi drop off Chegwidden
and meet us at the airport.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.488
I was responsible
for this.

35:58.523 --> 36:00.924
Besides, you guys are gonna
need all the help you can get.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.792
Look, playtime's over.
You want to help?

36:02.827 --> 36:05.695
Watch these guys
until LAPD arrives.

36:23.548 --> 36:25.515
KENSI:
All right, you guys,

36:25.550 --> 36:27.817
I got eyes on Yaniv,
Fletcher and Barbosa,

36:27.852 --> 36:29.919
and three armed guards.

36:29.954 --> 36:30.786
SAM:
Not much cover.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.856
CALLEN:
We don't have much of a choice.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.294
KENSI: Deal's going down.
Looks like

36:38.329 --> 36:39.896
they're about to load the gold
onto the plane.

36:41.766 --> 36:44.334
CALLEN:
We got to shut it down.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.835
It's now or never.

36:49.907 --> 36:51.474
Federal agents!
Drop your weapons!

36:52.510 --> 36:53.610
(automatic gunfire)

37:01.653 --> 37:04.254
(gunfire continues)

37:04.289 --> 37:05.622
Guys, I got three more

37:05.657 --> 37:06.723
heavily armed shooters.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.561
(bullets whizzing)

37:12.997 --> 37:15.298
G, this cover isn't gonna last.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.933
Kens, we're pinned down!

37:18.303 --> 37:20.270
I got no shot. No shot.

37:26.944 --> 37:28.645
(motorcycles engines revving)

37:29.714 --> 37:31.448
(yells)

37:42.894 --> 37:45.829
CALLEN: Federal agents!
Guns on the ground!

37:47.965 --> 37:49.866
Down!

37:49.901 --> 37:51.034
Out of the truck, now!

37:51.069 --> 37:54.604
Out of the truck. Move!

37:57.809 --> 37:59.609
(gasps)

38:01.746 --> 38:04.480
Oh, my God.

38:04.515 --> 38:07.717
Well, what did you expect?
You left us with motorcycles.

38:07.752 --> 38:08.918
And guns.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.353
And you?

38:10.388 --> 38:12.422
Next time you try
to ditch somebody,

38:12.457 --> 38:14.390
make sure they can't
catch an Uber.

38:14.425 --> 38:15.392
(chuckles)

38:16.627 --> 38:18.895
Son of a bitch stole my line.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.930
You know we could've
shot you, right?

38:20.965 --> 38:23.333
But you didn't.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.074
SAM:
G...

38:31.109 --> 38:33.610
I knew it was them
the whole time.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.125
Okay.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.694
Well, it looks like the
D.A. is gonna let you off

38:51.729 --> 38:52.862
with just
community service.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.097
What? How much?

38:54.132 --> 38:55.098
KENSI:
Oh, come on.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.966
You're lucky you weren't
charged with a felony.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.134
Please.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.504
I would've been off the grid
before they had the chance.

39:01.539 --> 39:03.373
Yeah, somehow,
I don't doubt that.

39:04.609 --> 39:06.142
Ready to admit it?

39:06.177 --> 39:08.111
Admit what?

39:08.146 --> 39:10.113
Our plan worked out.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.681
LANGSTON: Not that
we're gonna rub it

39:11.716 --> 39:12.782
in your face or anything.

39:12.817 --> 39:15.385
No, no, no.
Of course not.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.587
We got the gold back,
that's what's really important.

39:17.622 --> 39:19.589
BRIDGES:
You know,

39:19.624 --> 39:21.524
despite your
shoddy tradecraft...

39:22.960 --> 39:25.395
...you guys are all right
in my book.

39:25.430 --> 39:26.596
(chuckles)

39:26.631 --> 39:28.731
Yeah. Despite all the crap
you gave us,

39:28.766 --> 39:30.500
you're all right in ours.

39:31.836 --> 39:33.069
CHEGWIDDEN:
Next time.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.670
CALLEN:
Uh, I-I do not think

39:34.705 --> 39:36.472
this city could
handle a next time.

39:36.507 --> 39:37.874
LANGSTON:
Come on, gentlemen.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.142
We're running late.

39:39.177 --> 39:40.543
Where you guys headed
to at this hour?

39:40.578 --> 39:41.878
You stay out
of grown folks' business.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.680
(Callen laughs)

39:52.657 --> 39:53.756
BRIDGES:
Poison of choice?

39:53.791 --> 39:57.760
Oh, Pappy Van Winkle 25-year.

39:57.795 --> 39:59.796
Didn't know they
released that yet.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.398
They haven't.

40:04.569 --> 40:07.771
(sniffs, sighs)

40:10.074 --> 40:12.575
(sighs)

40:12.610 --> 40:15.578
Gonna miss seeing
that ugly old mug.

40:17.882 --> 40:19.515
If you can't see him

40:19.550 --> 40:21.784
in every one of us,

40:21.819 --> 40:24.587
you're not trying hard enough.

40:24.622 --> 40:26.656
Huh.

40:26.691 --> 40:28.091
To Owen.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.928
To Owen.

40:36.834 --> 40:37.900
(exhales sharply)

40:37.935 --> 40:42.605
Gonna be more unattended glasses
in the coming years.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.173
That's why we got to
make the most of the time

40:44.208 --> 40:45.541
we have left above ground.

40:45.576 --> 40:47.543
A lot of vets

40:47.578 --> 40:49.612
that need help out there.

40:49.647 --> 40:51.214
LANGSTON:
And then,

40:51.249 --> 40:53.716
there's what Owen
would have wanted us to do.

40:53.751 --> 40:55.852
Kill bad guys.

40:57.955 --> 41:00.089
HETTY:
Well, gentlemen...

41:01.893 --> 41:06.195
...we certainly have the means.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.197
(chuckles softly)

41:08.232 --> 41:11.901
HETTY: There's no reason
we can't do both.
