I'm home from camp.

00:36.186 --> 00:38.662
-Welcome home.
-Meg's been wearing
your clothes.

00:41.767 --> 00:43.617
Ah, my big man.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.269
How was Camp Angry Indian?

00:45.362 --> 00:47.529
Oh, they had to rename it
Camp Redface.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.607
Then soon after,
Camp Washington Football Team.

00:50.626 --> 00:53.126
But camp was awesome.

00:53.279 --> 00:54.720
I got a girlfriend.

00:54.947 --> 00:56.221
She's smoking hot,

00:56.298 --> 00:58.949
and she has some off the charts
scary political views,

00:59.042 --> 01:00.967
but largely because
of the smoking hot thing,

01:01.120 --> 01:02.953
we've decided to stay together.

01:02.971 --> 01:05.046
My boy has a girlfriend?

01:05.066 --> 01:07.124
Oh, Chris, that's amazing.

01:07.142 --> 01:10.218
Good job, Chris. You've really
impressed your old dad.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.738
Like Richard Gere's gerbil
impressed his dad.

01:12.965 --> 01:14.298

01:22.583 --> 01:24.065
-Freaking Doug.
-(button beeping)

01:24.234 --> 01:26.159
"Gooey Stewie, Gooey Stewie.

01:26.312 --> 01:28.161

01:28.314 --> 01:29.904
Yeah, right. I'll show him.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.165
Whoa, since when do you have
a treadmill?

01:32.259 --> 01:34.093
I took it from a Curves.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.002
They mostly just lie on mats.

01:36.155 --> 01:37.554
(button beeping)

01:38.841 --> 01:41.266
(grunts) Brian, help!

01:55.507 --> 01:58.575
Peter, how is a stud finder
gonna help with this?

02:00.955 --> 02:04.014
Beep, beep, beep.
Looks like I found the stud.

02:04.032 --> 02:05.440
(Peter and Stewie laugh)

02:05.459 --> 02:08.185
Oh, I know we have
our differences,

02:08.203 --> 02:11.538
but stuff like that,
it-it-- man, it's just--

02:11.690 --> 02:12.965
I just-- it's-it's fun.

02:13.192 --> 02:15.542
Enough, Peter.
I'm calling a handyman.

02:15.694 --> 02:18.554

-Fine. What's in here, anyway?

02:19.974 --> 02:21.623
-Bizarro Peter?
-Bizarro Peter.

02:21.717 --> 02:23.559
It's just that I'm reading.

02:27.389 --> 02:30.040
Peter, how many times
do I have to tell you

02:30.058 --> 02:31.966
to stop leaving
your wet swimsuit

02:31.986 --> 02:33.301
at the bottom of the stairs?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.228
I never know when
I'll be back in the sprinklers.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.048
I got to be able to grab and go
when they start spraying.

02:38.066 --> 02:40.475
Ugh, you're impossible.

02:40.569 --> 02:41.976
See that, Chris?

02:41.996 --> 02:44.663
In the Hungry Hungry Hippos
game of marriage,

02:44.890 --> 02:46.648
I just ate one of her marbles.

02:46.742 --> 02:49.242
I don't think you should
be proud of that, Dad.

02:49.395 --> 02:51.653
-Excuse me?
-Let me give you
a nickel's worth

02:51.672 --> 02:55.007
of free advice from one
happily taken man to another.

02:55.234 --> 02:56.675
We've got two of these

02:56.844 --> 02:58.493
and only one of these,

02:58.512 --> 03:01.680
so we should listen
twice as much as we talk.

03:01.831 --> 03:05.409
(chuckles) Remember, Dad, never
question your wife's choices.

03:05.427 --> 03:09.095
After all, you were one of them.

03:09.248 --> 03:10.914
I love cooking with wine.

03:10.933 --> 03:12.840
Sometimes, I even put it
in the food.

03:12.935 --> 03:16.010
Are you just quoting aprons
you saw in a kitchen magazine?

03:16.030 --> 03:18.346
The last few, yes.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:18.365 --> 03:20.515
I have a Chaturbate date
with my love.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.776
Isn't it hard to find
each other on there?

03:22.928 --> 03:25.662
Yeah, but that's part
of the dance.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.359
Hey, Jerome, could I get
a Twisted Tea over here?

03:31.378 --> 03:35.214
Uh-oh. Never a good sign when
a guy strays from linear tea.

03:35.365 --> 03:37.958
-Everything okay, Peter?
-Eh, it's just Chris.

03:38.110 --> 03:40.293
Ever since he got a girlfriend,
he's been insufferable.

03:40.446 --> 03:42.446
Chris got a lady? That's great.

03:42.464 --> 03:44.281
Do we know anything
about this girl?

03:44.374 --> 03:46.874
All I know is he met her
at camp, and she's from Canada.

03:46.969 --> 03:49.043
(inhales sharply)
Trouble.

03:49.121 --> 03:50.954
Have you seen Chris FaceTime her

03:50.973 --> 03:52.789
or heard her on the phone
or anything?

03:52.808 --> 03:54.291
-No, why?
-Peter,

03:54.384 --> 03:55.883
I don't know how to say this,

03:55.961 --> 03:57.552
but Canada
is kind of a red flag.

03:57.679 --> 03:59.571
Yeah, and white,
with a big leaf in the middle.

03:59.798 --> 04:01.073
You're awesome at flags.
So what?

04:01.242 --> 04:03.800
I hear Canada has a pretty
handsome prime minister.

04:03.893 --> 04:05.151
It's Tru-deau.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.746
Think about it, Peter,
a Canadian camp girlfriend

04:07.897 --> 04:09.248
nobody has ever seen?

04:09.399 --> 04:10.974
Seems a bit suspicious to me.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.584
What, you think he made her up?

04:12.736 --> 04:14.253
Chris wouldn't lie about this.

04:14.404 --> 04:16.404
You'd be surprised
at what people lie about.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.149
Cleveland claims he likes Miller
Lite because it tastes great.

04:19.167 --> 04:21.001
-It does.
-It's less filling.

04:21.153 --> 04:22.836
-Tastes great.
-Less filling!

So you just...

05:13.797 --> 05:16.039
fill the hole with your caulk?

05:16.058 --> 05:18.208
Yes, it's very thick,

05:18.301 --> 05:20.210

maybe you could
come back tomorrow

05:58.842 --> 06:02.194
and fix our... sink

and at the end of the day,

06:53.080 --> 06:55.247
all I want
is to come home, relax,

06:55.323 --> 06:57.657
do a couple of rad jumps
through Sprinkler City,

06:57.809 --> 06:59.901
and then enjoy a Popsicle

07:07.152 --> 07:09.577
Rule number two,

07:09.746 --> 07:11.488
please refer to rule number one.

07:11.581 --> 07:14.916

that to my girl later.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.176
Why not right now?

07:16.328 --> 07:18.845
Oh, she's probably
eating dinner,

07:18.997 --> 07:21.088
and we believe
family time is special.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.166
Uh-huh. So, Chris,

07:23.259 --> 07:25.502
what's this "girl's" name,
anyway?

07:25.595 --> 07:27.170
Jennifaire.

07:27.263 --> 07:28.688
Well, I'd love to see

07:28.782 --> 07:31.432
Jennifaire's Facebook page.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.785
Oh, we don't really believe
in social media,

07:33.954 --> 07:36.413
but I can show you a picture.

07:38.033 --> 07:39.182
What is this?

07:39.275 --> 07:41.017
It's an ad for Tim Hortons
in Canada.

07:41.110 --> 07:42.294
She's a model for them.

07:42.445 --> 07:45.112
She gets her weight in coffee
free every month.

07:45.207 --> 07:47.966
-That's too much coffee.
-I also love coffee.

07:48.117 --> 07:50.802
It's important in relationships
to have shared interests.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.471
You could learn from that, Dad.

07:52.622 --> 07:54.956
Look, I may have
relationship problems,

07:54.975 --> 07:57.033
but at least I have
a real relationship.

07:57.126 --> 07:58.626
What are you saying?

07:58.704 --> 08:00.812
You don't have a girlfriend.
You made her up.

08:01.039 --> 08:03.056
No, I didn't. She's real.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.299
She's real, huh?
Well, then, let's go see her.

08:05.393 --> 08:07.986
You and I are going to Canada
first thing in the morning.

08:08.137 --> 08:11.214
Peter, don't forget, you get
the flu shot tomorrow morning.

08:11.233 --> 08:12.382
We're going to Canada right now.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.550
And then, after,

08:13.643 --> 08:15.385
you're supposed to have
your prostate exam.

08:15.403 --> 08:16.995
Tomorrow afternoon,
we go to Canada.

08:17.146 --> 08:19.146
And then on Friday, we refill
your Percocet prescription.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.583
Sometime next week,
we're going to Canada.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.490
Peter, this is ridiculous.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.735
You don't have to drive
all the way to Canada

08:31.753 --> 08:33.011
just to prove a point.

08:33.162 --> 08:35.180
Don't worry, Lois, he's gonna
crack way before that.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.516
Well, at least bring
this thick sweater.

to get out.
