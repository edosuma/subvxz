14:18.727 --> 14:20.696

You don't have
to be afraid of this man.

14:22.898 --> 14:26.468
-Um, please leave us alone.

14:32.841 --> 14:36.512
I'm sorry, but something
is obviously going on here.

14:36.545 --> 14:38.713
You're screaming,
you're injured.

14:43.952 --> 14:45.186
Hey!

14:47.522 --> 14:50.158
I will call the cops.

14:54.229 --> 14:58.033
Please, lady, just fuck off.

15:02.904 --> 15:05.073
Sorry, did you just tell me...

15:06.108 --> 15:07.609
to fuck off?

15:10.512 --> 15:15.016
-Yep. Fuck off.
-Kevin, get inside. Now.

15:15.450 --> 15:17.886
I'm sorry, but please, I--
I'm fine.

is Neighborhood?

I usually only use it
to get free stuff, but...

15:28.564 --> 15:31.166
you know, sometimes
it devolves into this

15:31.199 --> 15:34.803
-white flight bullshit and...
-What was she saying?

15:34.836 --> 15:38.140
Oh, all this nonsense about,
you know, suspicious activity.

15:38.173 --> 15:41.443
-When was this?
-It-- it started
just before we left.

15:41.476 --> 15:43.445
And you didn't
say anything to me?

15:44.046 --> 15:46.948
-You-- you weren't on the app.
-So what?

15:48.050 --> 15:49.652
I didn't ask you to defend me.

15:49.685 --> 15:52.655
She was drawing attention to us.
I shut it down.

15:52.688 --> 15:55.724
So you're telling me that
what just happened on the lawn
didn't draw attention to us?

15:55.757 --> 15:58.160
-What-- what are you saying?
-You have to communicate
with me.

15:58.193 --> 16:01.463
This is the same thing
that happened
back at the farm with Olivia.

16:01.496 --> 16:03.599
Neither of us can afford
to go rogue like this.

16:03.632 --> 16:05.000
I'm not--
I'm not going back with you.

16:08.503 --> 16:09.738
What?

16:10.172 --> 16:11.840
I just-- I've been
thinking about this a lot,

16:11.873 --> 16:13.508
and it doesn't
make sense for me to--

16:13.842 --> 16:17.680
um, and, you know, it's like
we barely know each other.

16:17.713 --> 16:19.448
And-- and I don't mean that

16:19.481 --> 16:21.449
I don't care
because I don't know you.

16:24.820 --> 16:26.621

how to help you over there.

28:13.762 --> 28:15.096
Why?

28:17.766 --> 28:20.101
What do you know
about my mother's mother?

28:22.838 --> 28:26.074
She was a troubled woman.

28:26.575 --> 28:28.777
Not quite in
her right mind either.

28:29.778 --> 28:31.846
She disappeared, right?

28:33.181 --> 28:34.582
She-- she just vanished.

28:36.651 --> 28:40.789
Olivia's mother up and left
when she was just a baby, but...

28:42.657 --> 28:43.925
Dana.

28:44.493 --> 28:46.695
Where are you
getting all this from?

28:48.897 --> 28:50.432
My mother is alive.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.503
Yeah, she's alive.

28:55.804 --> 29:00.575
She's trapped. And... (sighs)

29:01.543 --> 29:05.014
Something happened to her back
in '92 when she was driving
with my father.

29:05.047 --> 29:08.917
She disappeared and-- and
she got pulled back in time
and-- and...

29:09.618 --> 29:11.820
I think the same thing
happened to her mother

29:11.853 --> 29:14.689
and it just happened to me,
and I've met her-- she...

29:15.423 --> 29:17.893
she's pulled back
in the past on a plantation.

29:17.926 --> 29:19.761
On the plantation
where I think...

29:20.562 --> 29:24.867
our family were owned as slaves
by the Weylins. And I don't know
how or why.

29:24.900 --> 29:27.402
But she's trapped there
and she needs our help.

29:28.837 --> 29:31.006
Ooh.
Okay, you know what?
This is--

29:31.039 --> 29:33.609
This is
a lot of information
we need to process.

29:33.642 --> 29:35.444
Let me tell someone
to cover for me.

29:35.477 --> 29:37.212
I think I just need
a little coffee or something.

29:37.245 --> 29:38.747
(both laugh)

29:38.780 --> 29:41.016
-Do you want anything?
-Sure. Yeah.

29:41.049 --> 29:45.186
Yeah? Okay.
I'll-- I'll be right back,
all right? All right

29:48.490 --> 29:51.493
KEVIN: So please, just call me
in an hour, and if you
don't hear from me,

29:51.526 --> 29:54.829
find my iPhone
and send help, okay?

29:56.498 --> 29:58.033
PENNY: Kevin, you're scaring me.

29:59.235 --> 30:02.538
-KEVIN: Uh, yes.
-PENNY: Okay.
Because I really want you

30:02.571 --> 30:05.107
-to take a hard look
at what you're doing--
-Okay, Penny, Penny, Penny.

30:05.140 --> 30:08.444
I'm here, I gotta go,
but, uh-- uh, call me back
in, uh, in an hour...

30:08.477 --> 30:10.713
-PENNY: You're where? Kevin?
-...if you don't
hear from me, okay?

30:10.746 --> 30:14.549
Hey. Uh, Mister, um-- uh-- Alan.

30:14.783 --> 30:16.752
-What the hell
are you doing here?
-Um, I got something

30:16.785 --> 30:18.553
that I really need
to give to Dana.

30:20.622 --> 30:24.693
Listen. I don't know what
you're on, or what game
you got going,

30:24.726 --> 30:27.829
or what you got
going on with that girl,
but drop it.

30:30.766 --> 30:32.834
Whole damn family full of crazy.

30:33.302 --> 30:37.072
I got this dude motherfucker
doing some shit.

30:37.105 --> 30:38.807
Stay away from her.

30:39.575 --> 30:42.611
Can I at least get
her phone number, I just want
to make sure she's okay.

30:42.644 --> 30:45.914
ALAN: No. Find yourself another
girl to mess with, Romeo.

30:52.254 --> 30:55.590
(phone buzzing)

31:11.573 --> 31:13.108
Okay.

31:14.710 --> 31:16.111
There you go.

31:18.613 --> 31:20.982
(sighs, chuckles) Okay.

31:22.784 --> 31:29.424
Mmm. All right, so let's just...
take it back... (chuckles)
...Um...

31:30.792 --> 31:34.829
All right.
Just tell me again, um...

31:36.131 --> 31:37.966
where exactly did you go?

31:44.506 --> 31:46.041
You don't believe me, do you?

31:49.177 --> 31:50.712
I believe that...

31:52.180 --> 31:55.917
you believe that what
you are going through is real.

31:58.487 --> 31:59.688
And...

32:00.856 --> 32:04.125
that you were at
a plantation in the past.

32:06.561 --> 32:09.932
And that this Rufus was there,
and your mom.

32:09.965 --> 32:11.566
I believe that you believe that.

32:13.602 --> 32:14.836
But...

32:16.738 --> 32:22.444
your mother...
and my brother died
in an accident

32:22.477 --> 32:26.081
when she drove
her car into the East River.

32:26.615 --> 32:29.784
And that happened because when
she was talking like this...

32:30.919 --> 32:32.454
I didn't do enough.

32:36.124 --> 32:38.526
And when my mother was sick,
I didn't do enough either.

32:41.229 --> 32:43.965
And I'm not gonna make
the same mistake with you, Dana.

32:46.101 --> 32:47.702
I love you too much.

32:58.780 --> 33:00.582
(sighs) Just--

33:02.784 --> 33:05.120
-DANA: Oh, shit.
-Oh, no, no, no, no,

33:05.153 --> 33:06.989
-No, no, no, it's okay.
-DANA: I'm sorry.

33:07.022 --> 33:08.957
It's all right, I'll just go
get some paper towels.

33:08.990 --> 33:10.826
-DANA: Sorry.
-Okay. All right.

33:10.859 --> 33:12.127
Just, um...

33:21.503 --> 33:22.804
Yeah, I see you, okay.

33:31.513 --> 33:33.715
(Dana sobs)

33:36.885 --> 33:39.221
-DANA: Kevin, I'm so stupid.
-KEVIN: What happened?

33:39.254 --> 33:41.122
What happened, what's wrong?

33:41.690 --> 33:43.726
Why do I keep
letting them do this to me?

33:43.759 --> 33:46.628
Why do I feel like
anyone would actually...

33:47.896 --> 33:49.531
believe me? I...

33:51.133 --> 33:52.834
I'm feel so stupid.

33:54.836 --> 33:57.806
-I feel so alone.
-You're not.

33:58.140 --> 34:01.977
You're not alone, I'm here,
and-- and I'm the stupid one.
I--

34:02.411 --> 34:07.816
Whatever's happening
to us, Dana,
it is something profound.

34:07.849 --> 34:09.718
And I never should have
turned away from it.

34:10.052 --> 34:11.987
I never should have
turned away from you.

34:12.020 --> 34:13.822
WOMAN ON PA: Code violet.

34:13.855 --> 34:16.158
We have a code violet
for Dana James.

34:16.191 --> 34:17.860
Code violet for Dana James.

34:17.893 --> 34:19.428
We should get out of here.
(clears throat)

34:19.461 --> 34:20.695
Okay.

34:22.097 --> 34:24.633
Maybe-- maybe-- maybe
I actually should stay.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.969
What?

34:27.002 --> 34:28.770
Maybe I'm actually sick.

34:29.838 --> 34:32.141
If you're sick, I'm sick.

34:32.174 --> 34:35.844
But I don't want to stay here,
and I need you to come with me.

34:36.712 --> 34:39.180
(alarm rings)

34:46.188 --> 34:47.956
WOMAN ON PA: Code violet.

34:47.989 --> 34:50.125
We have a code violet
for Dana James.

34:50.158 --> 34:52.093
Code violet for Dana James.

34:57.632 --> 34:58.867
MAN: Hold up! You go west!

34:58.900 --> 35:00.135
-Hold them up!
-DENISE: Dana!

35:00.168 --> 35:01.636
MAN: Let's go, Denise!

35:05.640 --> 35:06.908
Dana!

35:12.114 --> 35:13.682
-KEVIN: Fuck, fuck, fuck.
-(banging on door)

35:14.316 --> 35:16.885
-DANA: What are we
supposed to do in here?
-Uh, I-- I don't know,

35:16.918 --> 35:19.021
-I thought there'd be
a window or something.
-DENISE: Let us in!

35:19.054 --> 35:21.089
-Do we just wait it out?
-DANA: There are
cameras everywhere.

35:23.058 --> 35:26.729
-What are you even doing here?
-Oh, your mom...

35:26.762 --> 35:28.998
-(knocking on door)
-she gave this to me.

35:29.031 --> 35:31.667
-I think it means she can come
back with you.
-DENISE: Let us in!

35:31.700 --> 35:33.736
-Dana, just don't hurt yourself.
-KEVIN: What?

35:33.769 --> 35:35.570
(gasping)

35:36.038 --> 35:37.940
-Dana.
-DANA: My stomach.
It's happening.

35:37.973 --> 35:39.475
KEVIN: No, no, no. No, no, no.

35:39.508 --> 35:40.843
Oh shit. Dana. Okay. It's okay.

35:40.876 --> 35:42.444
You just gotta get your mother.

35:42.477 --> 35:43.946
You tell her
she can make the trip

35:43.979 --> 35:46.548
if she hangs onto you.
It's gonna be okay.

35:48.917 --> 35:51.086
Dana? Dana.

35:51.119 --> 35:52.955
Dana. Dana!

35:52.988 --> 35:56.859
Don't hurt yourself, Dana.
Come on, please.

35:56.892 --> 35:58.126
Yes, the keys.

36:04.966 --> 36:06.735
Dana?
