I thought we might have dinner

01:35.495 --> 01:37.397
at that new Chinese,
Italian deli.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.600
I heard great things
about their Moo Shu fettuccini.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.702
Well, no time today, Balki,
I’m busy researching

01:41.735 --> 01:43.537
a series we’re doing
on mass murders.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.338
It’s really fascinating stuff.

01:45.371 --> 01:47.240
I’ve discovered
that average people

01:47.273 --> 01:48.675
can turn out to be murderers.

01:48.709 --> 01:52.312
Uh, it could be the man
in the bank with the nice smile.

01:52.345 --> 01:53.413
Could be the man
in the barbershop

01:53.446 --> 01:54.548
with the little moustache.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.817
Could be the,
the man on a clock tower

01:56.850 --> 01:58.685
with the high‐powered rifle.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.755
Yes, it could.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.890
Balki,
I need to finish this research

02:03.924 --> 02:05.592

if she were a mass murderer.

that’s something you share

so could you please do this
somewhere else?

04:06.647 --> 04:07.948
Sure, cousin,
I could do it over here.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.751
‐No, no, not there.
‐Or I could do it on my bed.

04:10.784 --> 04:11.952
No.

‐Oh, Larry!

Now Mary Anne and I have known
each other all our lives.

we went to school together.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.568
We’re inseparable.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.870
Really? You’ve never been apart?

05:03.904 --> 05:06.740
Well, uh, we did lose touch
for a couple of years.

Ah‐ha! And would that be
between ’84 and ’85?

We‐well, yes.

All the murders
were committed in 1984 and 1985.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.619
Larry, it’s just a coincidence.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.453
No, well, did she ever tell you

05:20.486 --> 05:22.355
what she was doing during
those years you were apart?

05:22.388 --> 05:24.891
Well, no, doesn’t like to talk
about that time in her life.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.628
She calls it her..."Dark years."

05:29.696 --> 05:33.399
Well, that has a nicer ring than
"My murdering, psychotic years".

05:35.902 --> 05:38.004
Uh, o‐o‐okay, wait, wait.
Explain this to me.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.440
If Mary Anne is this
Mabel Alice Stallings

05:40.473 --> 05:41.742
why isn’t she in jail?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.777
It says right here
she was on trial for murder.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.478
Because I found out
she was acquitted.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.980
They never found the body.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.949
In fact, she was tried
for murder four times

05:48.982 --> 05:51.785
and none of the bodies
have ever been found.

05:51.818 --> 05:53.520

wait for Mary Anne to come home.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.692
Now when Mary Anne gets home,
I’m gonna bring her downstairs

05:58.725 --> 06:01.061
and we’ll clear this
whole thing up, okay?

06:01.094 --> 06:02.763
Okay.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.497
But whatever you do

06:04.531 --> 06:06.567

06:29.556 --> 06:31.191

a good camping hatchet.

06:35.495 --> 06:36.730
No! No hatchet!

No, no, no, cousin, cousin,
be careful. It’s very sharp.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.636
Mary Anne said she needed
a hatchet that was razor sharp.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.906
So you went out
and got it for her?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.107
What is the matter with you?

06:47.140 --> 06:48.909

with tremendous mood swings.

then you’re down

07:04.124 --> 07:05.792
then you’re over here,
then you’re over there.

07:05.826 --> 07:10.030
I mean, what is this emotional
roller coaster you’re on?

‐Yes‐ye...

you knew really well...

07:23.243 --> 07:25.746
...did a hideous,
horrible thing.

of the carton again, didn’t you?

Oh, she’s gone.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.843
What do you mean "Gone?"

07:56.877 --> 07:59.179
She was called to fill in
on a flight to Hong Kong.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.583
I believe you.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.751

to call her a lousy bowler

08:30.143 --> 08:32.578
but now you’ve gone too far.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.548

out of your mind?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.888
Jennifer’s on her way
to Hong Kong

is a dead ringer for Mary Anne.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.029
Now what are the chances
of that happening?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.264
One in a dozen?

09:25.932 --> 09:28.802
Balki, if you go on this trip
with Mary Anne

09:28.835 --> 09:31.938
she’ll kill you
just like she killed Jennifer.

to say goodbye.

Well, feed me carbos
and call me fatty.

Yeah, yeah,
alright, alright, l‐listen

09:46.987 --> 09:50.624
just cough once if Mary Anne
is making you say this.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.997
Yes, alright, I’ll,
I’ll s‐stop acting like this.

09:59.399 --> 10:02.102
Uh, uh...uh‐huh, uh‐huh...

10:02.135 --> 10:04.671
No, I, I‐I understand.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.641
You, you don’t wanna marry
a crazy man.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.912
Yeah, I’ll talk to you
when you get back.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.347
Yeah. Yeah.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.649
Bye‐bye.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.729
That was Jennifer?

10:29.930 --> 10:30.997
Yeah.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.300
She was calling
from the airport.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.871
‐The airport. On her way to...
‐Hong Kong.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.339
Hong Kong!

10:41.274 --> 10:42.876
Hong Kong.

10:42.909 --> 10:46.179
So that would indicate
that Mary Anne didn’t kill her.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.353
‐I’m sorry.
‐Yes. Yes. Yes.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.793
Well, um...if you’ll excuse me,
cousin, I, uh

10:59.826 --> 11:02.696
I’ve got a camping trip
to pack for but, but, hey...

11:02.729 --> 11:05.198
Now that you’ve solved
the Jennifer murder

11:05.231 --> 11:08.935
maybe you can figure out
who killed Laura Palmer.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.910
[theme music]

11:19.780 --> 11:23.216
(Larry)
I am so embarrassed. I made
a complete fool out of myself.

11:23.249 --> 11:26.286
Running around saying that, that
someone as sweet as Mary Anne

11:26.319 --> 11:29.956
killed four men and Jennifer.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.259
Well, I’m sure there’s a logical
explanation for this picture.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.328
There is.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.463
Mary Anne is a mass murderer.

11:39.933 --> 11:43.003
‐What?
‐Larry, look at the facts.

11:43.036 --> 11:47.207
The picture,
the "Dark years," the hatchet.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.178
But, but Jennifer’s alive
and in Hong Kong.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.014
Of course she’s in Hong Kong.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.849
So she won’t be
a witness to the murder.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.483
You do not have to be Columbo

11:57.518 --> 12:00.486
to figure out
what’s going on around here.

12:00.521 --> 12:03.757
Well, I can’t let Balki
go on that trip with Mary Anne.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.292
If you do, he’s a dead man.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.765
W‐Mr. Gorpley, where’s Balki?

12:11.798 --> 12:14.200
Oh, he’s on his way
to some mountain.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.268
What?

12:15.301 --> 12:16.402
Oh, he said he was

12:16.436 --> 12:17.971
going away for the weekend.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.239
I told him to take
the rest of the day off

12:19.272 --> 12:20.974
and get an early start.

12:21.007 --> 12:24.878
Wait a minute...I was nice
and I got nothing out of it.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.282
I’ve got to get to that mountain
and save Balki.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.917
I just hope it’s not too late.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.792
[instrumental music]

12:46.099 --> 12:47.801
How ya doin’, Balki?

12:52.873 --> 12:54.240
Uh...

12:54.274 --> 12:56.810
Well, I’m stuck.

12:56.843 --> 12:58.111
My feet hurt.

12:58.144 --> 13:01.147
And, and I just dropped
my water bottle.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.150
This is fun!

13:06.086 --> 13:08.154
Don’t worry, I’ll throw down
a rope to help you.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.525
[panting]

13:11.558 --> 13:15.061
Hold it right there, Mabel.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.898
Hu‐Larry!
What are you doing here?

13:17.931 --> 13:21.067
‐And who’s Mabel?
‐Oh, please!

13:21.101 --> 13:23.870
I know all about you,
you may be good

13:23.904 --> 13:26.607
but not good enough
to outsmart Larry Appleton.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.543
‐Now where’s Balki?
‐Balki’s stuck.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.411
And I was just about to throw
this rope down to help him.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.814
Nice try, Mabel.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.985
Larry, what are you doing?

13:43.957 --> 13:47.327
I’m making sure
that you don’t get away.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.864
And then,
I am going to save Balki.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.368
[grunting]

13:55.401 --> 13:56.603
Ooh!

13:59.472 --> 14:00.574
Oh!

14:00.607 --> 14:02.108
I think I speak for Jennifer

14:02.142 --> 14:04.878
when I say
you are out of the wedding!

14:08.081 --> 14:09.550
Balki, hang on.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.126
It won’t be long now!

14:20.160 --> 14:24.030
Tie first, then throw,
tie first, then throw.

14:25.431 --> 14:27.433
Uh, Larry,
that’s not a good idea.

14:27.467 --> 14:31.237
Oh, and I suppose murdering
my best friend is a good idea?

14:31.271 --> 14:34.074
No.
That’s not a good idea, either.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.214
[panting]
Hang on, Balki. Hang on.

14:41.247 --> 14:42.282
I’m coming.

[humming]

15:07.007 --> 15:09.910
Hi, cousin.
Glad you could drop in.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.546
Where do I come up with them?

15:12.579 --> 15:13.647
[gasps]
Oh!

15:16.316 --> 15:18.218
Balki, thank God you’re safe.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.421
Cousin, I’m fine, but,
but you seem a little bit upset.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.190
You seem like a person
who’s at the end of his rope.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.960
[laughs]

15:28.228 --> 15:30.296
Where do I come up with them?

15:32.298 --> 15:34.167
Alright, Balki,
there’s no time for jokes.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.236
I’ve come here to save you.
Now here, grab this rope.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.139
Okay, cousin, I have a question.
Is this rope secure?

15:39.172 --> 15:41.307
Because Mary Anne always said
that one of the first rules

15:41.341 --> 15:43.143
of rope climbing,
is to make sure

15:43.176 --> 15:46.146
that your lifeline
is anchored safely.

15:46.179 --> 15:50.116
Balki, when Larry Appleton
ties a knot, it stays tied.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.421

15:55.455 --> 15:57.190
It’s okay, it’s okay.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.759
I’ve got you.
It’s okay. I got you.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.094
I got you. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.195
I got you. I got you.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.363
[grunts]

16:05.065 --> 16:07.200
Balki, we’re trapped.
There’s no way out.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.401
Cousin, we’re not trapped.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.270
Mary Anne is still on top
of the mountain.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.173
We’ll just ask her
to throw a rope down. Mary Anne?

16:13.206 --> 16:14.641
It’s gonna be tough
for her to do.

16:14.675 --> 16:16.610
‐Why?
‐I tied her up.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.380
Why did you do that?

16:20.413 --> 16:23.383
I tied her up because
she’s trying to kill you.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.452
Cousin, I told you once,
I told you twice.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.454
I told you two times.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.490
Mary Anne is not
trying to kill me.

16:30.524 --> 16:33.226

Eye contact! Eye contact!

16:39.633 --> 16:41.735
Good. Good.

16:43.269 --> 16:47.140
Now, cousin, whatever you do

16:47.173 --> 16:50.343
don’t even think
about falling down

16:50.376 --> 16:53.046
because if you fall,
you’re gonna have plenty of time

16:53.079 --> 16:55.415
to think about it
on the way down.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.221
Now, I gotta get over there,
so just let me through.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.623
‐I gotta get through. Okay?
‐Okay. Okay.

17:02.656 --> 17:04.324
‐Okay?
‐Alright. Alright.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.826
‐I gotta get through.
‐Okay.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.359
‐I gotta get through.
‐What?

17:07.393 --> 17:09.462
‐I gotta get through.
‐W‐wait, what are you doing?

17:09.494 --> 17:11.732
‐Whe‐where are you going?
‐I’m gonna go...behind you.

17:11.765 --> 17:13.700
Okay, okay,
alright, alright, alright.

‐Okay, alright.

‐Here comes the leg.
‐Okay.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.608
‐The leg. The leg.
‐Got it.

I wanna get over there.

‐No, stay over there.
‐I wanna get over there.

‐Stay over there!
‐I gotta get over there!

‐Alright!

18:21.602 --> 18:22.803
‐My ledge!
‐Okay, okay.

just a second.

‐Okay. It’s cool.
‐Hm, okay, okay!

‐Come on.

‐Go ahead. Go ahead.
‐Okay. Let’s...

18:29.109 --> 18:31.411
‐Okay. Okay. Come on.
‐Okay. Okay.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.346
‐Come on. Careful.
‐Okay. Oh!

18:33.379 --> 18:35.181
‐Careful! Careful!
‐Ugh! Ugh!

Chest hair! Chest hair!

[sighing]

18:49.796 --> 18:51.598
Balki! Larry!

18:51.632 --> 18:56.302
I tied the rope to a big tree.
It’s safe to climb up.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.271
Balki, it’s a trap.
How did she get loose?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.674
Mary Anne,
how you did get loose?

19:00.707 --> 19:03.577
Oh, Larry couldn’t tie a knot
if his life depended on it.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.613
Would you like to go first?

19:06.647 --> 19:08.782
Balki, I’m telling you,
it’s a trap.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.717
If we grab onto that rope
and try to climb up

19:10.751 --> 19:12.452
she’ll let go
and we’ll hit the ground so hard

19:12.485 --> 19:13.854
they’ll take us home
in a pizza box!

19:13.887 --> 19:15.822
Well, I trust Mary Anne and

19:15.856 --> 19:17.457
and I’m gonna climb up
this rope.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.626
Now, Mary Anne
wouldn’t do anything to harm

19:19.660 --> 19:22.696
either one of us, so I,
I’m gonna climb up this rope

19:22.729 --> 19:26.166
and if you wanna stay here,
then you sue yourself.

19:34.675 --> 19:37.778
’Mary Anne, I’m coming.’

19:37.811 --> 19:40.180
’Do we have any of those
tuna sandwiches left?’

19:43.517 --> 19:45.519
Well, I‐I‐I’ll be fine.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.854
I’ll take my chances
climbing down.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.671
Balki?

20:05.939 --> 20:07.541
Oh, Balki?

20:07.574 --> 20:10.310
[instrumental music]

20:14.548 --> 20:17.483
(Jennifer)
I’m sure Mary Anne
can solve this mystery.

20:17.518 --> 20:20.320
You see, they got the captions
on these two pictures mixed up.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.354
This is a picture of me

20:21.387 --> 20:23.890
at the police academy graduation
with my boyfriend.

20:24.858 --> 20:26.827
Wait a minute, is that Tim Dark?

20:26.860 --> 20:28.629
I used to date him.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.800
Well, after you and Tim broke up

20:33.834 --> 20:35.569
we went out for two years.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.274
I was afraid you might get mad

20:41.307 --> 20:42.909
so I never showed you
that picture.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.947
So, that’s why you call them
the "Dark years."

20:51.017 --> 20:54.420
I guess these
are the Bartokomous years.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.559
Well...

21:00.694 --> 21:03.797
...I guess I owe
everybody an apology.

21:03.830 --> 21:07.000
Should I do ’em one
at a time or all together?

21:07.033 --> 21:08.935
Well,
when‐when he embarrasses us

21:08.969 --> 21:11.538
it’s usually a group apology but

21:11.572 --> 21:13.874
when he lies,
it’s‐it’s mostly individual.

21:13.907 --> 21:15.642
True.

21:15.676 --> 21:17.944
Then there was the time
we got those gift certificates.

21:17.978 --> 21:19.379
Oh, yeah!

21:19.412 --> 21:21.582
So I guess we’re due
for individual.

21:21.615 --> 21:22.816
Individual.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.488
Mary Anne

21:28.522 --> 21:31.558
I’m sorry I thought you were
a homicidal maniac...

21:33.894 --> 21:35.762
...who killed my fiance

21:35.796 --> 21:37.964
and was going to kill
my best friend.

21:37.998 --> 21:39.933
Oh, that’s okay, Larry.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.874
Balki, I’m sorry,
I almost got you killed

21:47.908 --> 21:50.010
on the side of the mountain.

21:50.043 --> 21:53.413
Oh, come on,
don’t worry about it, cousin.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.982
I’m just sorry that forest
ranger had to see you cry.

21:58.519 --> 22:00.954
Jennifer, I’m sorry
for making you feel

22:00.987 --> 22:04.024
like you’re engaged
to a crazy man.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.059
Well, Larry, I’m flattered

22:06.092 --> 22:08.795
that you were so concerned
about me but

22:08.829 --> 22:11.732
frightened by how quickly
you lose touch with reality.

22:14.434 --> 22:17.003
I promise
it‐it won’t happen again.

22:17.037 --> 22:19.973
And now what do you say,
we all go out

22:20.006 --> 22:22.342
and have a nice, quiet dinner?

22:23.510 --> 22:24.578
‐Okay!
‐Okay!

22:24.611 --> 22:25.879
Okay.

22:32.653 --> 22:34.420
This isn’t over, Appleton.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.690
I’d sleep with one eye open
if I were you.
