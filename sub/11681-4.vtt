WEBVTT

00:00.350 --> 00:01.950
My name is Michael Westen...

00:01.951 --> 00:04.520
I used to be a spy until...

00:04.521 --> 00:07.116
We got a burn notice on
you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.655 --> 00:09.586
When you're burned, you've got nothing...

00:09.654 --> 00:12.277
no cash, no credit, no job history.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.673
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.741 --> 00:16.728
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.796 --> 00:19.973
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.041 --> 00:22.624
You rely on anyone who's
still talking to you.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.941
A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...

00:24.942 --> 00:25.885
Should we shoot them?

00:25.953 --> 00:28.464
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...

00:28.532 --> 00:30.880
You know spies... a bunch
of bitchy little girls.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.424
- Family, too...
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:33.492 --> 00:35.600
- If you're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:35.668 --> 00:38.116
Bottom line... as long as you're burned,

00:38.184 --> 00:39.790
you're not going anywhere.

00:43.237 --> 00:45.513
Spies spend a lot of time travelling,

00:45.514 --> 00:46.879
but they don't usually end up

00:46.880 --> 00:49.152
in the most desirable destinations.

00:50.881 --> 00:52.820
You're much more likely to find yourself

00:52.887 --> 00:55.092
visiting a rebel camp
in the philippine jungle

00:55.160 --> 00:57.373
or a hidden bunker in
the mountains of Pakistan

00:57.374 --> 00:59.883
than lounging beach-side in the Bahamas.

00:59.951 --> 01:02.088
But even when you do find yourself

01:02.156 --> 01:05.331
in a vacation paradise, it's
still all about business.

01:05.399 --> 01:09.276
Michael, I can't believe I waited
this long to come to the Bahamas.

01:09.344 --> 01:11.482
I am at the loveliest little beach bar.

01:12.041 --> 01:13.186
You're at a bar?

01:13.187 --> 01:15.993
What happened to identifying
a dead body at the morgue?

01:16.061 --> 01:17.496
Oh, relax.

01:18.057 --> 01:20.455
Jesse and I are hard at work.

01:20.456 --> 01:22.323
I doubt the autopsy report

01:22.324 --> 01:24.294
was hidden under a keg of red stripe.

01:24.362 --> 01:27.268
Verifying the identity
of a dead weapons runner

01:27.336 --> 01:30.544
is not the vacation a girl dreams of.

01:30.612 --> 01:34.085
You know, don't get mad
if I have a little fun.

01:34.152 --> 01:37.693
Fi, Jesse's contact wasn't
just a weapons runner.

01:37.761 --> 01:38.762
I know.

01:38.830 --> 01:40.900
He worked for whoever is behind

01:40.968 --> 01:44.675
all this international nastiness
that you're trying to stop.

01:45.140 --> 01:46.613
I just spent two hours on a boat

01:46.681 --> 01:48.651
with Jesse singing the same old song.

01:52.359 --> 01:54.597
And he's even more worked
up about it than you are.

01:55.153 --> 01:57.002
Lucky for both of you, I met Ty...

01:57.003 --> 01:58.906
the delightful coroner's assistant...

02:00.343 --> 02:01.811
Who's about to loan me his keys.

02:03.982 --> 02:05.784
We call this "The Love Boat."

02:11.163 --> 02:12.933
Oh, no, you can't.

02:13.001 --> 02:15.238
Like magicians, pickpockets
rely on misdirection.

02:15.306 --> 02:16.273
You like it?

02:16.341 --> 02:17.844
I like it.

02:17.912 --> 02:19.882
Whether you're pulling
keys out of a pocket

02:19.950 --> 02:21.318
or a rabbit out of a hat,

02:21.386 --> 02:23.055
it's all about big distractions.

02:23.123 --> 02:24.693
I can't stop.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.095
Very good.

02:26.163 --> 02:28.500
You ready to go, sweetbread?

02:28.569 --> 02:30.495
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come now.

02:30.496 --> 02:31.741
You've been eyeing me since you walked in.

02:31.809 --> 02:33.712
You don't think I seen
you flirting with me?

02:33.780 --> 02:35.081
Time to dance!

02:35.149 --> 02:37.720
- Oh, no.
- Easy, girl. Don't be a tease.

02:37.788 --> 02:40.057
Yo, let her go.

02:40.125 --> 02:42.662
Why you want a confrontation?

02:42.730 --> 02:44.565
Back away before you get clapped, man!

02:44.633 --> 02:46.235
What, boy? You back up!

02:46.302 --> 02:47.671
No, no, no! Don't hurt him!

02:50.844 --> 02:53.047
Break it up! Let him go!

02:53.115 --> 02:54.115
Break it up!

02:54.183 --> 02:56.119
That's okay.

03:01.829 --> 03:03.865
Time's a tickin', Jesse.

03:04.864 --> 03:06.870
Yeah, I'm going as fast as I can, Fi.

03:06.871 --> 03:09.271
Apparently, this guy's method
of filing things is to not.

03:13.639 --> 03:15.473
Jesse...

03:15.541 --> 03:17.074
Wait. Hold on.

03:17.142 --> 03:19.009
Yeah. I got it.

03:19.077 --> 03:21.478
Good, because Ty just
walked in with a cop buddy.

03:21.546 --> 03:22.781
You need help making it out?

03:22.849 --> 03:24.818
Nah. Getting by that guy
will be a piece of cake.

03:24.886 --> 03:26.688
Just leave me the car and go get the boat.

03:27.404 --> 03:29.257
Keys are under the mat, hotshot.

03:36.335 --> 03:39.939
Spies don't always have
a choice of hiding places.

03:40.007 --> 03:43.144
Sometimes it comes down
to taking what's available.

03:45.414 --> 03:46.849
But if you have to hide in

03:46.916 --> 03:49.085
something that's designed to be airtight,

03:49.153 --> 03:50.721
you better hope the danger passes

03:50.789 --> 03:52.824
before you run out of oxygen.

04:00.801 --> 04:02.834
I guess I forgot them.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:18.781 --> 04:21.349
Hey... that's the guy!

04:21.416 --> 04:22.817
Stop that guy!

04:43.850 --> 04:44.857
Gun it!

04:44.858 --> 04:45.970
- Piece of cake, huh?
- Just go!

06:42.506 --> 06:43.112
Hey, Mikey.

06:43.113 --> 06:44.857
Can we take your car?
Mine's running on "e."

06:44.858 --> 06:45.958
Sure, Sam. What's up?

06:46.026 --> 06:48.160
Oh, we're just gonna meet some friends...

06:48.228 --> 06:49.394
Josh and Lila Wagner.

06:49.462 --> 06:50.762
Is this a job?

06:50.829 --> 06:52.296
Well, you're gonna love 'em, Mike.

06:52.364 --> 06:54.765
They run this great little
charity called "Help at Home."

06:54.833 --> 06:57.869
They work with soldiers' families
who were killed in combat.

06:57.936 --> 06:58.911
I volunteer all the time.

06:58.912 --> 07:02.032
Last Christmas, I was
"Sammy" Claus for the kids.

07:02.033 --> 07:03.509
- That's really great of you.
- Yeah.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.842
Yeah. So this is a job?

07:04.910 --> 07:07.273
Well, it's more like a consultation.

07:07.274 --> 07:08.474
I don't have all the details,

07:08.542 --> 07:09.808
but Josh got caught up in a scam.

07:09.876 --> 07:11.343
He invested the charity's money

07:11.411 --> 07:13.044
in a company called Blue Crest...

07:13.112 --> 07:14.412
just tiny amounts at first.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.847
All of a sudden, he saw huge returns.

07:15.914 --> 07:17.212
Hey, you're a psychic!

07:17.213 --> 07:18.882
Then after a while, Josh starts to think

07:18.950 --> 07:20.650
how many more people he could help

07:20.718 --> 07:22.485
if he just turned up the volume a little.

07:22.553 --> 07:23.619
He decides to go all-in,

07:23.686 --> 07:25.387
and, next thing you know, money's gone.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.355
Sounds like the cops
could consult on this.

07:28.422 --> 07:29.692
They tried it, Mike.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.260
Once the cops got a
look at the paper trail,

07:31.328 --> 07:32.928
they said it would take
months to wade through.

07:32.996 --> 07:35.796
All I want you to do is
just hear what the problem is

07:35.864 --> 07:37.898
and point us in the right direction.

07:37.966 --> 07:39.199
- And that's it?
- Yep.

07:39.267 --> 07:42.001
Point you in the right
direction and I go home?

07:42.068 --> 07:43.468
Yeah, that's it.

07:43.536 --> 07:46.037
And for that, you get
that warm, fuzzy feeling

07:46.105 --> 07:47.639
that comes with giving back.

07:47.930 --> 07:49.262
Plus, a free lunch, Mike.

07:49.992 --> 07:51.407
Ribs!

08:03.046 --> 08:04.879
You got to try these ribs, Mike.

08:04.947 --> 08:07.381
Josh marinates them in beer for two days.

08:07.449 --> 08:09.550
You hear what I'm talking? Two days.

08:09.617 --> 08:11.584
Sam, you have to go talk to Josh.

08:11.652 --> 08:12.944
Well, that's why we're here.

08:12.945 --> 08:15.256
No, he left. He went to
go confront Nick Madison.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.630
Ok .Whoa Lila, just slow down here.

08:19.631 --> 08:21.558
Madison is the guy that took the money?

08:21.559 --> 08:23.846
The bank called, and they
said there's nothing we can do.

08:23.847 --> 08:25.602
The charity's getting shut down on Monday.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.535
I didn't know it was that bad, Sam.

08:27.536 --> 08:29.305
It is, and Josh blames himself.

08:29.373 --> 08:31.340
I... I've never seen him this upset.

08:32.029 --> 08:33.730
H... he went to Blue Crest now.

08:33.798 --> 08:36.365
He wants to make Madison
give the money back.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.967
I just don't want him
to make things worse.

08:39.034 --> 08:40.669
Okay, look. Don't worry about it.

08:40.736 --> 08:42.904
We'll find Josh and make
sure nothing bad happens.

08:42.972 --> 08:44.872
Okay. Thank you.

08:46.307 --> 08:48.474
This is starting to feel like a job, Sam.

08:48.542 --> 08:49.612
Relax, Mike.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.883
This'll take less than a
day out of your busy life.

08:51.951 --> 08:53.219
And, look, until Fi and Jesse

08:53.287 --> 08:54.621
find the real address for Kassar,

08:54.688 --> 08:56.921
what else you got to do?

09:07.331 --> 09:08.734
Yeah, so if we could
just have that address,

09:08.735 --> 09:09.549
we'd be so grateful.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.734
It's kind of an emergency... we're, uh...

09:11.801 --> 09:13.508
We're leaving on our
honeymoon cruise tomorrow,

09:13.509 --> 09:14.409
aren't we, sweet potato?

09:14.477 --> 09:15.910
Oh, that's so sweet.

09:15.978 --> 09:19.080
Yeah, well, it would be
if we were legally married.

09:19.147 --> 09:21.016
Scott's divorce just came through,

09:21.017 --> 09:23.423
and his ex-wife's idiot lawyer,

09:23.424 --> 09:24.446
Jeremiah Kassar,

09:24.447 --> 09:25.918
he sent us copies of the paperwork.

09:25.919 --> 09:27.119
And we need the originals, baby.

09:27.186 --> 09:28.220
I know, I know, I know.

09:28.287 --> 09:29.521
I got to track this guy down today.

09:29.588 --> 09:30.634
We need a home address.

09:30.635 --> 09:32.145
Oh, I see.

09:36.902 --> 09:38.195
What's that?

09:38.262 --> 09:39.796
Our confidentiality policy.

09:39.864 --> 09:42.031
There's no way I'm
giving you that address.

09:42.099 --> 09:43.332
But my parents,

09:43.400 --> 09:45.875
they're flying in to
see us off from New York.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.737
In the field, you can never count on

09:48.804 --> 09:50.738
your first approach being successful.

09:50.806 --> 09:53.307
You have to be ready to
change tactics on the fly.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.709
Spies learn to make
lightning-fast observations

09:55.777 --> 09:57.744
and connect the dots just as quickly.

09:57.812 --> 10:00.532
Little things like a
family photo with no father

10:00.533 --> 10:01.982
and a missing wedding ring

10:01.983 --> 10:03.483
can tell you all you need to know

10:03.484 --> 10:05.273
about a target's soft spot.

10:05.274 --> 10:07.372
Or better yet, their sore spot.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.573
You want to leave now,
or should I call the cops?

10:09.641 --> 10:11.308
You know what? Let it go, Tanya.

10:11.376 --> 10:13.277
We're gonna have to get a court order.

10:13.344 --> 10:15.311
Look, the truth is Jeremiah
Kassar is not a lawyer.

10:15.379 --> 10:16.846
He's a scumbag.

10:16.914 --> 10:19.615
We're with an organization
called Deadbeat Dad Trackers.

10:20.222 --> 10:23.619
Kassar is two years behind
on his child-support payments.

10:23.686 --> 10:25.320
- Two years?
- Two years.

10:25.388 --> 10:26.888
And we can go through official channels,

10:26.956 --> 10:27.886
but it takes a while, you know?

10:27.887 --> 10:30.057
And when I think of his
poor little kids, I just...

10:30.719 --> 10:34.294
They deserve a decent pair of shoes.

10:36.063 --> 10:38.598
Come on. Let's go.

10:39.048 --> 10:40.081
Wait.

10:41.052 --> 10:43.286
How do you spell his name?

10:47.824 --> 10:51.374
Josh is here, all right. That's his car.

10:51.375 --> 10:52.942
Nice parking job.

10:53.010 --> 10:54.777
Yeah, well, he's probably upset.

10:54.845 --> 10:58.079
I mean, the Gus on the verge
of losing his life's work, here.

10:58.147 --> 11:00.981
Sam, how far will Josh take this?

11:01.049 --> 11:02.216
I don't know. Why?

11:02.284 --> 11:03.558
I think he brought his gun.

11:03.559 --> 11:05.792
- Just give me the money back!
- I don't have it!

11:05.859 --> 11:07.826
I swear to God I did not steal from you.

11:07.894 --> 11:09.661
- Liar!
- He's not l... lying!

11:09.729 --> 11:11.563
Please don't s... shoot
us, Mr. Wagner! Please!

11:11.630 --> 11:13.597
Josh!

11:13.665 --> 11:15.332
You don't want to do this.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.301
Sam?! What the hell are you doing here?

11:17.368 --> 11:19.202
- I'm here to help. Just put that down.
- Who are you?!

11:19.270 --> 11:20.737
My name's Michael. I'm a friend of Sam's.

11:20.804 --> 11:22.438
- Listen. Let's talk about this.
- No!

11:22.506 --> 11:24.646
- There's a better way to handle this, Josh.
- No, no, no!

11:24.647 --> 11:26.914
I tried better ways, Sam.

11:26.982 --> 11:29.182
I... I... I went to the
police. I asked nicely.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.051
Nothing happened. Nothing worked.

11:31.119 --> 11:32.511
I am out of options!

11:35.000 --> 11:36.267
We don't anybody to get hurt, Josh.

11:36.335 --> 11:37.468
We don't want you to go to jail.

11:37.536 --> 11:38.970
I deserve to go to jail

11:39.037 --> 11:42.273
for trusting the charity's
money to this thieving bastard!

11:45.510 --> 11:48.245
I'm not going anywhere. Understand me?

11:48.312 --> 11:51.515
Not until I get every
penny of that money back.

11:51.582 --> 11:52.649
Josh, buddy.

11:52.717 --> 11:55.351
I know that you're upset, but...

11:56.353 --> 11:57.887
Oh, my God!

11:57.955 --> 11:59.988
I'm not your goddamn buddy.

12:03.690 --> 12:04.857
Who called the cops?

12:04.924 --> 12:06.324
Okay.

12:06.391 --> 12:07.723
- Get in there!
- Josh, what are you doing?

12:07.790 --> 12:09.390
I'm locking them in the break room.

12:09.458 --> 12:13.227
Leave, Sam. This is my problem.

12:13.294 --> 12:15.129
Mike, Josh is a good
man. I got to help him.

12:16.635 --> 12:18.904
If he won't give us that gun,
we're gonna have to take it.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.039
Miami police! Come out with your hands up!

12:24.575 --> 12:26.309
Sam, what are you doing?

12:26.377 --> 12:29.379
We need to get Josh out of
here so nobody gets hurt.

12:29.446 --> 12:31.481
This might not be the smart play, Mike...

12:33.083 --> 12:35.885
But I'm following my gut on this one.

12:41.923 --> 12:43.423
I'm helping Josh.

12:43.491 --> 12:45.825
You're not changing my
mind. Now move, Mike!

12:45.893 --> 12:49.561
How? By making this a hostage
situation? Come on, Sam.

12:49.629 --> 12:51.296
It's already a hostage situation, Mike!

12:51.364 --> 12:53.829
No matter how you cut this
deck, Josh is going to jail.

12:53.830 --> 12:55.330
I can't get his life back,

12:55.397 --> 12:57.466
but I can sure as hell
make sure that Madison

12:57.467 --> 13:00.200
doesn't get rich robbing the
children of dead veterans!

13:00.268 --> 13:01.859
Fine! If this is about the money,

13:01.860 --> 13:04.027
let's get everybody out,
then go after the money.

13:04.095 --> 13:04.995
Yeah? How? Look!

13:05.063 --> 13:06.596
They're packing up shop, Mike.

13:06.664 --> 13:08.498
We let them walk now, he's gonna be gone

13:08.565 --> 13:11.001
before the cops take Josh's mug shot!

13:24.513 --> 13:25.880
What the hell are you doing?

13:25.948 --> 13:27.881
How many times do I
got to tell you? Leave!

13:27.949 --> 13:29.315
I'm not going anywhere.

13:29.383 --> 13:30.586
You want your money back,
you're gonna need some help.

13:30.588 --> 13:34.052
What? No! This is my fault!

13:34.120 --> 13:35.053
I'll fix this.

13:37.016 --> 13:38.303
That would be the police.

13:44.796 --> 13:46.196
Oh, my God.

13:56.973 --> 13:59.039
They're not answering, Lieutenant.

14:01.509 --> 14:05.478
This is Lieutenant Seth
Casey, Miami Metro police.

14:08.758 --> 14:11.316
Whoever you are, if you
want this to work out,

14:11.384 --> 14:13.618
you will pick up the phone right now.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.119
We need to talk.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.487
W... what do I do? What do I say?

14:16.555 --> 14:19.081
Mike, this train's about
to start moving real fast.

14:19.082 --> 14:21.074
It's not too late for you to hop off,

14:21.075 --> 14:22.174
but I'm staying.

14:22.242 --> 14:23.609
In a hostage crisis,

14:23.676 --> 14:26.199
first contact with the police is critical.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.200
One wrong word from a hostage-taker

14:28.268 --> 14:31.135
can be the difference between
the start of negotiations

14:31.203 --> 14:33.571
or the start of an armed assault.

14:33.638 --> 14:35.172
- Pick up the phone!
- Stop!

14:35.240 --> 14:36.673
- He said I should...
- Leave it.

14:36.741 --> 14:38.708
You sound like you're
gonna jump off a bridge.

14:38.776 --> 14:40.010
You answer a phone like that,

14:40.011 --> 14:41.692
and you'll have a SWAT team
banging through the door

14:41.693 --> 14:42.671
before you hang up.

14:42.672 --> 14:43.615
I'll get it.

14:45.519 --> 14:47.453
I leave when you leave.

14:47.883 --> 14:49.185
Hello? Hello?

14:49.186 --> 14:50.453
Who am I speaking with?

14:50.520 --> 14:52.157
He says I can't answer
any of your questions.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.724
He says that no will get hurt

14:53.792 --> 14:56.004
as long you don't come any closer.

14:56.005 --> 14:58.573
O... okay, but tell him I can't help him

14:58.641 --> 15:00.407
u... unless I can talk to him.

15:00.475 --> 15:01.508
He says I got to go.

15:01.576 --> 15:02.709
Wait, wait, wait. Don't hang up.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.177
Tell him the line's open.

15:04.245 --> 15:05.878
Anytime he wants to talk,
all he has to do is...

15:09.115 --> 15:10.064
You hung up on him?

15:10.065 --> 15:12.011
This is more of a "less
is more" situation.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.315
I'm just buying time.

15:14.507 --> 15:17.141
Okay, Josh, we're gonna
help you get your money back,

15:17.209 --> 15:18.575
but only if you let us call the shots.

15:18.643 --> 15:20.844
Are you sure about this?
You could go to jail.

15:20.912 --> 15:23.212
Right now we're just two friends
trying to end this peacefully.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.222
As long as it stays that way,

15:24.223 --> 15:26.642
Mike and I can get your money
back and stay out of jail.

15:26.643 --> 15:28.409
- Deal?
- Deal.

15:28.477 --> 15:29.977
Josh.

15:30.524 --> 15:33.446
Sorry, Josh. Can't have anybody
getting shot by accident.

15:33.965 --> 15:35.298
No bullets?

15:35.366 --> 15:37.166
I was just trying to scare them.

15:37.234 --> 15:38.801
I'd say you pulled that off.

15:38.868 --> 15:40.536
Find out who works in that office.

15:40.603 --> 15:41.903
See who these cars belong to.

15:41.971 --> 15:42.971
I'm already on it.

15:43.038 --> 15:44.972
No phone, no Internet, no a/c.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.908
A little time in the sauna,
and he'll want to talk.

15:53.479 --> 15:54.879
What do we do now?

15:54.947 --> 15:57.692
Now we separate Nick and
Patty and get some answers.

15:57.693 --> 15:58.483
I got dibs on Nick.

15:58.551 --> 16:00.952
He won't be able to talk
with you choking him.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.787
I'll start with Nick. You take Patty.

16:12.162 --> 16:13.129
You okay?

16:13.197 --> 16:15.030
Who are you again?

16:16.265 --> 16:17.932
Name's Michael.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.134
I'm just a friend who doesn't
want anybody to get hurt.

16:20.202 --> 16:22.603
I asked Josh if I could talk to you.

16:22.670 --> 16:23.737
To me?

16:23.805 --> 16:25.555
He's the whack job running around

16:25.556 --> 16:27.374
cracking people in the face with guns.

16:27.441 --> 16:29.810
T... tell him to let me go!

16:29.878 --> 16:31.120
I tried that, Patty.

16:31.121 --> 16:33.612
I did everything I could to
walk him out of this building,

16:33.613 --> 16:36.090
but it looks like we're
gonna need your help,

16:36.091 --> 16:38.001
because, see, he's not leaving

16:38.002 --> 16:39.570
until he gets his money back.

16:39.637 --> 16:41.445
I know Mr. Wagner is upset,

16:41.446 --> 16:43.147
but he is blaming the wrong people.

16:43.215 --> 16:46.417
It's like Nick says...
investing is a risk.

16:46.484 --> 16:48.619
You know, you're everybody's best friend

16:48.686 --> 16:51.226
as long as the cash is
rolling in, but the second...

16:51.227 --> 16:53.048
the second somebody takes a loss,

16:53.049 --> 16:54.950
guess who they're pointing the finger at?

16:56.386 --> 16:59.154
Is that fair? Is it my fault
that the economy crashed?

16:59.222 --> 17:00.855
I am not judging you, Nick.

17:00.923 --> 17:02.624
I mean, these are tough times.

17:02.691 --> 17:05.961
You get a little behind.
It's hard to catch up.

17:06.028 --> 17:08.590
So maybe you move some money around.

17:08.657 --> 17:11.321
It's not stealing. It's just buying time.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.689
But if you want to get out of here alive,

17:16.757 --> 17:20.192
then you're gonna have to come clean.

17:20.259 --> 17:22.026
What do you want me to do?

17:22.094 --> 17:23.761
Tell me where the money is!

17:23.828 --> 17:25.497
We didn't steal any money!

17:29.302 --> 17:32.371
Do you know why Josh snapped, Patty?

17:32.439 --> 17:33.939
Because innocent families...

17:34.007 --> 17:36.208
and I'm talking widows and little kids...

17:36.276 --> 17:38.010
are gonna be out on the street.

17:38.078 --> 17:40.279
Do you know why?

17:40.347 --> 17:42.381
Because your boss looted his charity,

17:42.449 --> 17:43.816
and you helped him do it!

17:43.884 --> 17:45.451
That is a lie!

17:47.087 --> 17:49.693
Nick would never do anything like that.

17:50.299 --> 17:52.522
You're talking about
a man who was in tears

17:52.523 --> 17:54.518
when he had to lay off his staff.

17:54.519 --> 17:56.753
He felt so bad, he's
been helping Tom Norris

17:56.821 --> 17:58.160
with his mortgage the last few months...

17:58.161 --> 17:59.861
out of his own pocket!

17:59.929 --> 18:02.276
That's the Nick Madison I know.

18:02.277 --> 18:05.278
W... what if I give you the
computer, uh, password...

18:05.345 --> 18:07.711
the password to our computer system?

18:07.779 --> 18:09.979
You could access Josh's client file.

18:10.047 --> 18:13.245
Um... There's transaction
records, account statements,

18:13.311 --> 18:14.799
balance sheets... the whole nine.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.694
You could tell him that I...
I didn't do anything wrong.

18:20.159 --> 18:22.682
Maybe he'd believe you.

18:32.424 --> 18:33.991
Here's the last printout.

18:34.338 --> 18:36.907
When interrogators hear
a story without any holes,

18:36.974 --> 18:38.541
they know someone's lying.

18:38.609 --> 18:42.044
Only people who are afraid of
getting caught take the time

18:42.112 --> 18:45.381
to rehearse every detail and
anticipate every question.

18:45.449 --> 18:47.082
So? What's the good news?

18:47.150 --> 18:48.761
The same holds true for accounting.

18:48.762 --> 18:51.076
Perfect books are like perfect alibis...

18:51.077 --> 18:53.076
it confirms you're dealing with a liar.

18:53.748 --> 18:55.407
But there's no way to prove it.

18:55.408 --> 18:56.575
There's nothing here.

18:56.642 --> 18:57.909
Nick must have another set of books.

18:57.977 --> 18:59.378
They might not even be in the building.

18:59.445 --> 19:01.046
Can't we just make him tell us?

19:01.114 --> 19:03.082
Nick's smart enough to know
he can keep denying everything

19:03.149 --> 19:04.083
and wait for the cops.

19:04.150 --> 19:05.384
What about Patty?

19:05.451 --> 19:06.336
She's innocent.

19:06.337 --> 19:07.785
Nick conned her like everybody else.

19:07.853 --> 19:09.052
So, what are you telling me?

19:09.120 --> 19:10.853
I did all this for nothing?

19:10.920 --> 19:12.754
I'm not gonna get the money
back and I'm gonna go to jail?

19:12.822 --> 19:15.030
Hang on. Patty mentioned a Tom Norris.

19:15.031 --> 19:16.682
Norris, yeah... he was
the first guy I talked to

19:16.683 --> 19:18.016
when I started investing with Blue Crest.

19:18.084 --> 19:19.551
Patty said he's Nick's right-hand man.

19:19.619 --> 19:21.419
Dollars to donuts he
knows where that money is.

19:21.487 --> 19:23.654
Talking to him might be
the best move at this point.

19:23.722 --> 19:25.856
Am I missing something,
because it sounds as though

19:25.924 --> 19:27.724
you plan to talk to
someone who's not here!

19:27.792 --> 19:30.125
Relax, Josh. We still have
friends outside that can help.

19:30.126 --> 19:31.899
How are we gonna call him? We're
not allowed to use the phone.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.167
We can't use that phone.

19:33.234 --> 19:34.902
Dig up what you can on Norris.

19:34.969 --> 19:36.469
Put Nick in the break room with Patty.

19:36.537 --> 19:37.937
I'll find a way to call out.

19:43.309 --> 19:45.377
In a hostage situation,

19:45.445 --> 19:48.744
it's standard procedure for
police to run cellphone jammers

19:48.745 --> 19:50.982
and commandeer all the
phone lines in your location.

19:51.050 --> 19:53.116
To make a call without a police operator,

19:53.184 --> 19:55.785
you need to access a line
they're not listening on.

19:55.853 --> 19:58.654
It's a lot like stealing
cable from your neighbor.

19:58.722 --> 20:01.753
If you can access a common
wall and stretch the conduit,

20:01.754 --> 20:05.174
you can connect your phone to
the unmonitored line next door.

20:05.175 --> 20:06.695
Mike, that password Nick gave you

20:06.696 --> 20:08.365
got me into Norris' personnel file.

20:08.366 --> 20:09.999
I got an address,
social security number...

20:10.067 --> 20:11.800
everything but his
turn-ons and his turn-offs.

20:11.867 --> 20:12.864
How long is this gonna take?

20:12.865 --> 20:15.803
Well, it'll go faster if
you'd give me a little room!

20:15.871 --> 20:16.904
Hey. Trying to help.

20:22.476 --> 20:24.610
No, Michael's still
not answering his phone.

20:24.677 --> 20:26.311
Got a feeling Michael's
gonna want to be here

20:26.379 --> 20:27.812
when we find out what Kassar was up to.

20:27.880 --> 20:31.449
Well, Sam's favors tend to
involve a lot of food and drink.

20:31.516 --> 20:33.417
They probably haven't made
it past the appetizers yet.

20:33.484 --> 20:36.352
Well, I guess he'll have
to miss out on all the fun.

20:36.813 --> 20:39.520
Will it be starting anytime soon, Speedy?

20:39.588 --> 20:41.555
Kassar wasn't taking any chances.

20:41.622 --> 20:43.756
He's got a double-cylinder dead bolt,

20:43.824 --> 20:45.858
which probably cost more than his car.

20:45.926 --> 20:47.359
This could take a minute.

20:47.426 --> 20:48.827
Well, we may not have a minute.

20:48.894 --> 20:50.461
Here comes the welcoming committee.

20:50.529 --> 20:52.029
Hey. Can I help you?

20:52.096 --> 20:53.163
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:53.230 --> 20:54.530
You know, you may already have.

20:54.598 --> 20:56.664
Did you send in your
census questionnaire yet?

20:56.732 --> 20:58.299
We're with the census bureau.

20:58.367 --> 21:00.945
Your neighbor here didn't take advantage

21:00.946 --> 21:02.635
of the self-addressed,
stamped envelope we provided.

21:02.703 --> 21:04.736
Which means we need to
conduct an in-person interview.

21:04.804 --> 21:05.872
Yeah.

21:05.940 --> 21:07.527
Do you guys have I.D.'S?

21:07.528 --> 21:08.488
I hate to sound paranoid,

21:08.489 --> 21:10.129
but we had break-ins
around here recently.

21:10.130 --> 21:12.992
Really? That is a shame...
in this neighborhood?

21:13.312 --> 21:14.293
Of course we have I.D.'S.

21:14.294 --> 21:17.060
Yeah, mine is in my
briefcase, which is in the car.

21:17.128 --> 21:18.128
In the car.

21:18.195 --> 21:18.995
Hers... in the car.

21:19.063 --> 21:21.142
Oh, would that be the grey
Mustang that's parked out front...

21:21.143 --> 21:25.478
license number G-C-6-J-2-7?

21:27.038 --> 21:29.435
Strangers make us a
little nervous these days.

21:31.477 --> 21:33.973
Oh, it's a, uh, supervisor.
We got to go. Sorry.

21:33.974 --> 21:36.408
Aw. He's a ball-buster.
We got to take this.

21:36.476 --> 21:38.342
Okay.

21:38.410 --> 21:39.843
Fi. Fi, it's me.

21:39.911 --> 21:43.712
Perfect timing. Kassar has
the nosy neighbor from hell.

21:43.779 --> 21:45.190
I think getting into this
place isn't gonna be as easy...

21:45.191 --> 21:46.895
Fi, Fi, let's worry about that later.

21:46.896 --> 21:50.149
Right now Sam and I are in the
middle of a hostage situation.

21:50.217 --> 21:51.185
Jesus, Michael!

21:51.186 --> 21:52.889
Well, tell me where you
are and who's holding you.

21:52.890 --> 21:55.926
It's more like... We're
the hostage-takers.

21:55.927 --> 21:57.027
I... I'll explain later.

21:57.095 --> 21:58.695
Right now, I need you to find someone.

21:58.762 --> 22:00.963
It's Michael. Get the details.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.143
Hurry. Hurry up and open it.

22:07.211 --> 22:08.615
Everything okay here, Josh?

22:08.616 --> 22:09.583
Everything's great.

22:09.651 --> 22:10.953
I told Josh, if it helps,

22:11.021 --> 22:12.859
that I would show him our bank accounts.

22:12.926 --> 22:15.830
Not just t... the company's,
but my own personal statements.

22:15.898 --> 22:18.032
Trust me, buddy... after you see these,

22:18.100 --> 22:20.768
you will know that we
are all in the same boat.

22:20.835 --> 22:22.202
Here's your proof.

22:24.939 --> 22:27.340
You're not trying to
help us! You're with him!

22:27.407 --> 22:28.908
So this is your show, huh?

22:28.975 --> 22:31.776
Well, you had me going there
for a minute, Mr. Good Samaritan.

22:31.844 --> 22:33.578
"I don't want anybody hurt."

22:33.645 --> 22:34.979
- Take him to the break room.
- Let's go. Come on.

22:36.180 --> 22:39.282
You know what this means, don't you?

22:39.350 --> 22:41.317
You're all going to jail!

22:54.034 --> 22:55.999
Armed kidnapping...

22:56.067 --> 22:58.433
unlawful confinement...

22:58.501 --> 22:59.800
Madison's right...

22:59.868 --> 23:01.601
we're looking at some
serious jail time, Mike.

23:01.602 --> 23:04.271
You're not helping the mood, Sam.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.139
Sorry I got you into this, brother.

23:06.207 --> 23:07.674
I'm the one who decided to stay.

23:09.243 --> 23:10.310
Funny.

23:10.378 --> 23:11.655
When I was 10 years old,

23:11.656 --> 23:15.248
I wanted an air rifle more than
anything in the whole world,

23:15.315 --> 23:17.383
but my dad wouldn't get it for me.

23:17.450 --> 23:19.585
So I used my five-finger discount.

23:19.652 --> 23:21.725
You got caught stealing a bb gun?

23:21.726 --> 23:24.037
Mike, it was a red ryder, okay?

23:24.038 --> 23:26.324
My dad told the cops to lock
me up for a couple hours...

23:26.391 --> 23:27.725
you know, just to freak me out.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.859
I haven't seen the inside
of a jail cell since.

23:29.927 --> 23:33.262
It's a little early to call it a day, Sam.

23:34.896 --> 23:37.265
We still got some cards to play.

23:40.870 --> 23:43.137
Can I talk to... Casey?

23:43.205 --> 23:46.674
Is this Nick? Or Josh? Or Michael Westen?

23:47.326 --> 23:48.775
You still there?

23:49.368 --> 23:53.046
Yeah. I can't answer any questions.

23:53.114 --> 23:54.767
I... I understand, and I
won't get you in trouble,

23:54.768 --> 23:57.471
but I need to ask a
very important question.

23:57.472 --> 24:00.674
Now, if the answer is yes, just
say, " I can't answer that."

24:00.741 --> 24:01.707
Is everyone safe?

24:01.775 --> 24:03.175
I can't answer that.

24:03.243 --> 24:05.477
He says he wants a panel van...

24:05.544 --> 24:08.605
full tank of gas, no side or back windows.

24:08.606 --> 24:11.615
He says he'll hurt one of us
if he doesn't see it in an hour.

24:11.683 --> 24:13.317
I... I'd love to help,

24:13.385 --> 24:15.085
but I need a sign of good faith.

24:15.153 --> 24:18.355
I can't give him a van until
he releases one of the hostages.

24:18.423 --> 24:19.789
Uh-huh. Okay.

24:19.857 --> 24:22.859
He says he'll let one of us
go as soon as he sees the van.

24:25.841 --> 24:26.395
We got good news.

24:26.463 --> 24:28.397
We have an escape vehicle coming.

24:28.464 --> 24:29.431
Bad news?

24:29.498 --> 24:31.132
The negotiator knows I'm in here.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.400
Ah, geez, Mike.

24:32.467 --> 24:34.034
Look, maybe we should just pull the plug.

24:34.102 --> 24:36.803
I'll talk to the cops, tell
'em that we forced you to help.

24:36.871 --> 24:38.338
One problem at a time, Sam.

24:38.406 --> 24:40.073
First the money, then the escape.

24:40.140 --> 24:42.875
Let's just hope Fi and Jesse
can get their hands on Norris.

25:00.223 --> 25:04.453
Making a cold approach to a
scam artist is never ideal.

25:04.454 --> 25:05.767
They tend to assume

25:05.768 --> 25:07.488
that a stranger showing up out of the blue

25:07.489 --> 25:09.873
is either a cop or
someone they've ripped off.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.735
My man, Tommy! How you been, dude?

25:14.802 --> 25:16.335
Listen, we need to...

25:16.403 --> 25:19.304
either way, you have to
be ready for them to run.

25:19.372 --> 25:23.108
Fortunately, tactical
support can make a foot chase

25:23.175 --> 25:24.876
much more civilized.

25:24.943 --> 25:27.945
Instead of relying on speed and endurance,

25:28.013 --> 25:31.079
all you need is a
distraction and good timing.

25:36.552 --> 25:38.052
Stings, doesn't it?

25:38.120 --> 25:39.064
I want my lawyer.

25:39.065 --> 25:41.522
Well, that would help if we were cops.

25:41.589 --> 25:42.661
But we work for Nick.

25:42.662 --> 25:44.390
- What?
- Oh, come on now, Tommy.

25:45.350 --> 25:47.083
You know those marks that come
in, just asking to get taken...

25:47.084 --> 25:48.752
who do you think is
sending them to you, huh?

25:48.820 --> 25:50.054
We're here for our latest cut.

25:50.122 --> 25:51.690
Wait a minute. You're the crew from Boca?

25:51.758 --> 25:52.891
Why didn't you say something?

25:52.959 --> 25:54.159
You didn't give me a chance to!

25:54.226 --> 25:55.626
I'm sorry, man! I got spooked!

25:55.694 --> 25:57.228
What'd you come to me for, anyway?

25:57.296 --> 25:59.096
I mean, you know Nick handles the payouts.

25:59.164 --> 26:01.164
You haven't heard.

26:02.089 --> 26:03.533
Get in the car.

26:05.870 --> 26:07.304
What the hell happened?

26:07.371 --> 26:09.305
Place got raided a couple hours ago.

26:09.672 --> 26:11.237
Nick gave us a heads-up
on his way out of town.

26:11.238 --> 26:12.638
Said we can get our cut from you.

26:12.706 --> 26:14.237
He didn't even call me.

26:14.238 --> 26:15.638
Focus on our money, Tom.

26:15.706 --> 26:17.172
I don't have your money.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.040
You have access to the account, right?

26:19.108 --> 26:21.442
What account? Don't you get it?

26:21.983 --> 26:23.910
Every time we wrap up a big score,

26:23.978 --> 26:26.078
Nick converts the take to cash.

26:26.146 --> 26:29.046
He's got a floor safe
in the conference room.

26:34.350 --> 26:36.917
You think he'll fit?

26:39.920 --> 26:40.922
Fi.

26:40.923 --> 26:42.990
Lucky you, Michael. You're
sitting on the money.

26:43.058 --> 26:44.078
Nick has a floor safe

26:44.079 --> 26:45.759
under the carpet in the conference room.

26:45.827 --> 26:48.094
Crack that puppy and come
on out with your hands up.

26:48.162 --> 26:49.462
It won't be that easy, Fi.

26:49.530 --> 26:52.301
Sam and I are on the
hook for accomplices now.

26:52.369 --> 26:53.703
Seriously, Michael?

26:53.771 --> 26:56.341
You have to stop doing favors for Sam.

26:56.989 --> 26:58.843
Have you requested a getaway vehicle?

26:58.911 --> 27:00.245
Yeah. It's on the way.

27:00.312 --> 27:02.180
Well, you're gonna need a diversion,

27:02.248 --> 27:03.715
and judging from the police turnout,

27:03.782 --> 27:05.149
it's gonna have to be a big one.

27:05.217 --> 27:08.652
Fi, if there ever was a time
to pull out all the stops,

27:08.720 --> 27:09.653
this is it.

27:09.721 --> 27:10.954
Michael...

27:11.022 --> 27:13.123
I never thought I'd
hear you say those words.

27:15.694 --> 27:18.462
Move over. You're lying on my c-4.

27:19.830 --> 27:21.496
He's got it in cash?

27:21.564 --> 27:24.820
It's the last phase of scams like this.

27:25.221 --> 27:27.540
Cash is almost impossible to trace.

27:27.541 --> 27:31.044
Yeah, especially when you use
it to buy a million-dollar yacht

27:31.112 --> 27:33.313
and sail into early retirement.

27:35.451 --> 27:36.696
Looky there.

27:37.744 --> 27:39.141
Well, hello.

27:39.142 --> 27:40.142
Son of a bitch.

27:41.477 --> 27:44.075
I'll be right back.

27:44.143 --> 27:46.076
Sam, Madison's not gonna
give him the combination.

27:46.144 --> 27:47.577
Yeah, I know, Mike.

27:47.645 --> 27:50.246
We're gonna have to find another
way to get into that safe.

27:50.314 --> 27:52.181
I got this one, Mikey.

27:55.485 --> 27:57.018
Hey!

27:57.086 --> 27:59.617
We found the safe, you bastard.
Now what's the combination?!

27:59.618 --> 28:02.119
- What safe? What is he talking about?
- Oh, you didn't know?

28:02.186 --> 28:04.421
Yeah, the money Nick stole is
in a floor safe right out there.

28:04.488 --> 28:05.588
Is that true?

28:05.656 --> 28:07.590
Well, there's a safe, yeah.

28:07.657 --> 28:09.258
But there is no money in it.

28:09.326 --> 28:11.259
Well, t... then give up the combination!

28:11.327 --> 28:13.261
Show them it's empty so we can go home!

28:13.329 --> 28:14.662
It's not empty.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.465
Our clients' most sensitive
information is in there.

28:18.533 --> 28:20.729
That's what these guys are really after,

28:20.730 --> 28:22.914
and when they get it, they'll kill us.

28:22.915 --> 28:24.449
Give me back the money.
Give me back the money!

28:24.517 --> 28:26.250
Back off, Josh.

28:27.285 --> 28:29.886
Do you know what's stopping
me from killing you right now?

28:29.954 --> 28:31.094
Absolutely nothing.

28:31.095 --> 28:33.356
Kidnapping or murder, I
die in prison either way.

28:33.423 --> 28:36.859
Killing me won't get you the combination!

28:40.296 --> 28:41.463
Okay.

28:42.205 --> 28:44.549
We'll just have to do this the hard way.

28:44.742 --> 28:46.109
What... what are you doing?

28:46.696 --> 28:48.896
I don't care if you
burn me or electrocute me

28:48.964 --> 28:50.598
or whatever it is you're thinking!

28:50.665 --> 28:52.966
Relax, Nick. I just want
to borrow your toaster.

28:58.171 --> 29:00.372
Floor safes are virtually impenetrable

29:00.439 --> 29:02.307
as long as they're in the floor.

29:02.375 --> 29:04.313
If you don't have a
jackhammer to pry one out,

29:04.314 --> 29:06.143
you need to get creative.

29:08.512 --> 29:10.579
Homemade shape charges will do the trick,

29:10.647 --> 29:12.314
but if you want to avoid

29:12.382 --> 29:14.617
turning a standoff into
a full-scale breach,

29:14.684 --> 29:17.286
you'd better have a
way to muffle the blast.

29:39.702 --> 29:40.453
Hey, Mikey.

29:40.454 --> 29:43.370
Our buddy Nick has some
top-of-the-line clubs...

29:43.438 --> 29:44.805
Titanium.

29:56.616 --> 29:59.351
Once a floor safe is out of the floor,

29:59.419 --> 30:02.855
it offers about as much
protection as a piggy bank.

30:10.968 --> 30:12.308
Looks like there's more
than a million there,

30:12.309 --> 30:13.960
but you might want to
count it just to make sure.

30:14.028 --> 30:15.313
Oh, my God.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.778
- You said there was no money.
- Shut up.

30:20.737 --> 30:21.890
Down, down.

30:24.293 --> 30:26.093
It's okay. Everything's
okay. Sit down and shut up!

30:26.161 --> 30:28.495
I just need to take you to
the break room, all right?

30:28.563 --> 30:30.831
You're okay. You're okay.

30:30.899 --> 30:32.599
You think they heard that?

30:34.369 --> 30:36.357
Team 1, strike positions.

30:36.358 --> 30:37.831
Copy that. Moving.

30:37.832 --> 30:39.698
Fi, this is not good.

30:40.318 --> 30:42.819
This is not good.

30:46.222 --> 30:47.790
Michael, what's up? The cops are in place.

30:47.791 --> 30:49.328
They're about to breach. We're not ready.

30:49.329 --> 30:52.127
Forget about the diversion,
Fi. How much time do we have?

30:52.128 --> 30:54.984
Well, they already have entry teams
in place with breaching rounds.

30:55.052 --> 30:56.585
They still need perimeter support.

30:56.653 --> 30:59.354
You've got about five minutes at best.

30:59.422 --> 31:00.488
What are you gonna do?

31:00.556 --> 31:02.556
I wish I knew.

31:15.924 --> 31:16.912
How's it looking, Sam?

31:16.913 --> 31:18.816
Fi said we got about five
minutes before the breach.

31:18.817 --> 31:20.692
- Yeah, probably less.
- The cops are coming in?

31:20.693 --> 31:22.944
Yeah. All right, so, look.
Here's what we're gonna do.

31:22.945 --> 31:25.278
Josh and I are gonna walk
outside and give ourselves up.

31:25.346 --> 31:26.888
No, Sam. I think we might be able...

31:26.889 --> 31:28.631
Mike, save it. Look,
this is not your call.

31:28.632 --> 31:30.061
If there's any chance
to keep you out of jail,

31:30.062 --> 31:31.928
- we're gonna go for it.
- I appreciate that, Sam,

31:31.996 --> 31:33.862
but I think we might be able
to keep us all out of jail.

31:33.863 --> 31:35.830
The cops don't know who
they're coming in for.

31:35.898 --> 31:37.365
Remember that Parker thing in Lima?

31:37.433 --> 31:39.325
Lima? No. No, Mike.

31:39.326 --> 31:41.094
You know I like to roll the dice,

31:41.162 --> 31:41.956
but that's just taking it too far.

31:41.957 --> 31:43.124
What are you guys talking about?

31:43.192 --> 31:44.625
There was a bank heist in lima.

31:44.693 --> 31:46.277
Supposedly, the guys who did it

31:46.278 --> 31:47.872
made themselves look like the victims

31:47.873 --> 31:49.040
and they snuck out scot-free.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.508
If you can get Patty on our side

31:50.575 --> 31:51.976
and I can put this gun in Nick's hand,

31:52.043 --> 31:53.024
we can do the same thing.

31:53.025 --> 31:55.208
Mike, you'd have to do a lot
more than get it in his hands.

31:55.209 --> 31:56.689
He's gonna have to be
pointing that sucker.

31:56.690 --> 31:59.356
Trust me... he's gonna be
ready to shoot somebody.

31:59.424 --> 32:02.693
Mike, you know that story's just a myth.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.194
Nobody believes they pulled it off.

32:05.663 --> 32:07.330
Then I guess we'll be the first.

32:17.504 --> 32:19.106
Patty...

32:19.174 --> 32:22.011
This is about to be over, and
I just want to let you know

32:22.078 --> 32:23.845
that I'm sorry about what happened.

32:23.913 --> 32:26.148
I know Josh is, too.

32:26.215 --> 32:28.317
But, you know, Nick caused all this.

32:28.384 --> 32:29.584
You think I don't know that?

32:29.652 --> 32:32.602
Everything he told me was a lie.

32:33.802 --> 32:34.968
I don't even want to think about

32:34.969 --> 32:37.558
the people whose lives
I helped that man ruin.

32:37.626 --> 32:39.193
It's not your fault. He fooled everybody.

32:39.261 --> 32:40.894
That'll help me sleep tonight.

32:41.490 --> 32:43.705
Well, you know, it's not too
late to do some good here.

32:43.706 --> 32:45.032
If we work together,

32:45.100 --> 32:47.567
you and Josh can move on with
your lives when this is over.

32:47.635 --> 32:49.803
What are you saying?

32:49.870 --> 32:52.738
Well, the cops are gonna
ask who the bad guy is.

32:52.806 --> 32:55.207
I'm hoping we all have the
same answer to that question.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.912
I can tell you right now I hate Nick.

32:59.979 --> 33:04.151
Prison would be too good
for that... Evil bastard.

33:06.755 --> 33:09.490
But he didn't hold a gun
to my head and keep me here.

33:09.557 --> 33:11.425
You ask me, you should all go to jail.

33:14.295 --> 33:15.896
You're wrong.

33:19.300 --> 33:20.967
I did this.

33:21.035 --> 33:24.269
Not them. Me.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.969
And I'm sorry.

33:26.659 --> 33:29.672
I know it was wrong, and I am
willing to face the consequences

33:29.740 --> 33:32.241
but I... I just couldn't live with myself

33:32.309 --> 33:35.510
knowing that those people
were gonna lose their homes

33:35.578 --> 33:38.450
and not be able to feed their kids.

33:40.213 --> 33:42.180
So, you're gonna point
the finger at somebody,

33:42.248 --> 33:43.914
point it at me.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.354
On your knees.

33:54.422 --> 33:56.524
W... what are you doing?

33:56.592 --> 33:57.827
You're a smart guy.

33:57.894 --> 33:59.695
Figure it out.

33:59.762 --> 34:02.297
Please... you can't kill me!

34:02.364 --> 34:04.899
Why not?

34:04.966 --> 34:06.533
We found the money.

34:07.388 --> 34:09.434
We only need one hostage
to walk out of here.

34:09.435 --> 34:10.858
We took a vote. You won.

34:10.859 --> 34:12.873
Wait! Think about it! You
don't want a murder rap!

34:12.873 --> 34:15.127
T... t... they'll never
stop chasing you, and...

34:15.975 --> 34:19.744
spies are trained to
follow certain procedures

34:19.812 --> 34:22.579
when holding someone at gunpoint.

34:22.647 --> 34:26.516
Stand out of arm's reach...

34:26.583 --> 34:29.118
Keep your weight on your back foot...

34:29.186 --> 34:31.120
Never take your eye off the target.

34:32.789 --> 34:35.056
Unless you want your weapon taken.

34:35.123 --> 34:36.757
Then you do exactly the opposite.

34:36.826 --> 34:37.891
Sam, what are you doing?!

34:37.960 --> 34:39.659
I told you she couldn't witness this!

34:46.132 --> 34:47.600
Back off!

34:47.668 --> 34:49.502
Everybody over there! Move!

34:49.570 --> 34:52.271
This kind of sucks for
you, doesn't it, buddy?

34:52.339 --> 34:54.539
You and your friends are going to jail,

34:54.607 --> 34:56.091
and I'm going to Aruba.

34:56.092 --> 34:57.508
All right, Patty, when we get outside,

34:57.576 --> 34:59.076
it's probably best you
keep your mouth shut.

34:59.144 --> 35:01.537
I can explain the cash,
and if you want to get cute

35:01.538 --> 35:02.826
and mention something about a scam,

35:02.827 --> 35:05.449
there's nothing you can say
I can't talk myself out of!

35:05.516 --> 35:07.217
So, let's go.

35:09.478 --> 35:11.120
Don't be stupid, hero.

35:11.187 --> 35:13.121
I don't think you have what it
takes to shoot somebody, Nick.

35:13.189 --> 35:14.723
Are you crazy?

35:14.791 --> 35:16.591
You're a two-bit scam artist, Nick.

35:16.659 --> 35:17.959
You're all talk.

35:18.027 --> 35:20.261
That's why you got into
cons in the first place...

35:20.328 --> 35:22.262
so you wouldn't have to do a man's work.

35:22.330 --> 35:25.332
You're about to make the
stupidest mistake of your life.

35:25.399 --> 35:26.499
Now move.

35:26.567 --> 35:28.968
Am I wrong, Nick? You've got the guts?

35:29.036 --> 35:30.569
You've got the guts to pull the trigger?!

35:30.637 --> 35:32.337
You're damn right I do!

35:38.200 --> 35:40.074
- He's crazy!
- Don't shoot! No!

35:44.018 --> 35:45.425
Give me you hands.

35:49.183 --> 35:50.239
Clear.

35:52.479 --> 35:54.358
- Show me your hands. Keep your hands up.
- Okay. Okay.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.415
How'd it go with Casey?

36:00.184 --> 36:01.545
Just stuck to the story, Mike.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.795
It's all on Patty now. Is she with us?

36:04.863 --> 36:07.064
Your guess is as good as mine, brother.

36:07.131 --> 36:09.216
Spies don't always make decisions

36:09.217 --> 36:11.215
based on training, experience,

36:11.216 --> 36:13.095
or potential success of a mission.

36:13.096 --> 36:14.696
Sometimes, it's just a matter

36:14.764 --> 36:16.131
of doing what you think is right,

36:16.198 --> 36:19.204
even if it means putting your
fate in the hands of a stranger.

36:19.271 --> 36:21.559
911. What's your emergency?

36:21.560 --> 36:23.494
Oh, my God! He's got a gun!

36:23.562 --> 36:25.962
Please! Hurry! Please!

36:26.030 --> 36:28.497
That's you, right?

36:30.900 --> 36:32.267
It's okay.

36:33.088 --> 36:35.756
It's all right, Patty.

36:35.824 --> 36:37.791
I know you've had a hard day.

36:37.859 --> 36:40.126
Look, I'm not trying to make
it any harder or any longer.

36:42.395 --> 36:44.262
I have one simple question.

36:44.330 --> 36:45.996
Why'd you make that call?

36:48.733 --> 36:52.402
Josh Wagner came in
completely out of control.

36:52.469 --> 36:55.204
He said Nick had stolen
over a million dollars

36:55.271 --> 36:59.507
from his charity and he wanted it back.

36:59.575 --> 37:03.644
Nick denied everything.
He said Josh was crazy.

37:03.711 --> 37:06.646
And that's when Josh pulled the gun?

37:16.153 --> 37:18.220
No.

37:18.288 --> 37:19.688
Nick pulled the gun.

37:22.392 --> 37:26.262
He's a liar and a thief,

37:26.330 --> 37:28.431
and he knew he was about to be exposed,

37:28.498 --> 37:30.933
so he took us hostage.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.101
All of us.

37:39.408 --> 37:40.775
What are you doing?

37:40.843 --> 37:42.544
Wait, wait, wait! You can't do this!

37:42.612 --> 37:44.446
I was a hostage!

37:52.823 --> 37:56.399
Westen! I guess I should be thanking you.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.488
According to Patty,

37:57.489 --> 37:59.133
if you and your buddy
Sam hadn't been around,

37:59.134 --> 38:01.301
things could have been a lot worse.

38:01.368 --> 38:03.169
I was just helping out a friend.

38:03.236 --> 38:04.770
Got the department's file on you.

38:04.838 --> 38:06.671
Says you have a fondness for explosives.

38:06.739 --> 38:08.239
It just so happens I got a safe

38:08.307 --> 38:09.741
blown out of the floor in there.

38:09.808 --> 38:11.909
That was like that when we got here.

38:11.977 --> 38:13.911
You're telling me that
Nick blew up his own safe?

38:13.979 --> 38:15.679
Maybe he forgot the combination?

38:21.080 --> 38:23.417
I don't think I could ever find
the words to thank you guys.

38:23.418 --> 38:24.554
Well, those ribs were a good start.

38:24.622 --> 38:26.856
If you really want to thank
us, call our friend Barry.

38:26.924 --> 38:29.526
It's time you let a pro
handle your finances.

38:29.527 --> 38:31.595
I'll make sure of it.

38:34.264 --> 38:36.606
So, Mike, uh, I guess
I owe you an apology.

38:36.607 --> 38:37.903
Why? You were right, Sam.

38:37.904 --> 38:39.805
You said it would take less than a day.

38:39.872 --> 38:41.406
I did, didn't I?

38:41.474 --> 38:43.025
That's one long-ass day.

38:49.161 --> 38:49.952
Hey, Sarge,

38:49.953 --> 38:51.824
nosy neighbor from hell's
a block and a half away.

38:54.216 --> 38:56.115
Dude... You got to go lighter on the rake.

38:56.116 --> 38:57.682
You're never gonna get the last pin.

38:57.683 --> 38:59.683
When was the last time
you did this in the field?

38:59.684 --> 39:01.685
I'm saying window's
closing, super spy. Let's go.

39:06.357 --> 39:08.592
I'm in.

39:10.061 --> 39:13.330
Fresh-painted walls and
steam-cleaned carpets

39:13.331 --> 39:16.867
are great if you're a realtor
showing a vacant apartment.

39:16.868 --> 39:18.669
If you're a spy hoping to find a clue,

39:18.670 --> 39:21.270
there's nothing worse than
a sparkling-clean home.

39:21.271 --> 39:22.704
Maybe Kassar's a neat freak.

39:22.705 --> 39:25.573
If you can't even find
spare change in the sofa,

39:25.574 --> 39:27.442
chances are you won't
find anything at all.

39:27.443 --> 39:29.275
- You're wasting your time.
- Hey.

39:29.749 --> 39:32.018
You want to go wait in the
car, be my guest, all right?

39:32.019 --> 39:34.539
I didn't jump through all those
hoops, tracking this guy down

39:34.540 --> 39:36.741
just to give up 'cause
you say it's a dead end.

39:36.742 --> 39:37.908
It might not be a dead end.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.676
Spring cleaning like this takes time.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.210
Chances are somebody was seen.

39:41.211 --> 39:44.079
You want to go talk to
the neighborhood watchdog?

39:44.080 --> 39:45.079
All right.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.547
I'm letting you know right now,

39:46.548 --> 39:49.282
that chick is a stickler for I.D.'s.

39:49.283 --> 39:51.385
You just happened to bring that?

39:51.386 --> 39:54.356
I had a feeling we might need it.

39:54.357 --> 39:56.559
I'm sorry, Agent Gordon.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.929
I don't think I'll be of much help.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.065
Uh, you'd be surprised, miss...

40:01.066 --> 40:02.466
Kendra.

40:02.467 --> 40:05.735
Sometimes the little details
make a big difference.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.570
When's the last time you saw Mr. Kassar?

40:07.571 --> 40:09.906
I don't know. A few days, I'd say.

40:10.263 --> 40:12.830
And you haven't noticed
any, uh, suspicious people

40:12.831 --> 40:15.133
or unfamiliar vehicles
since he's been gone?

40:15.134 --> 40:17.001
Like I said, it's been
pretty quiet around here.

40:17.002 --> 40:18.202
Sorry.

40:18.203 --> 40:20.270
Thank you for your time... Kendra.

40:24.942 --> 40:26.142
What's up?

40:26.143 --> 40:27.677
Says she doesn't know anything.

40:27.678 --> 40:29.111
Yeah, so what's that look for?

40:29.112 --> 40:30.646
There were pictures on the wall,

40:30.647 --> 40:32.647
but Kendra wasn't in any of them.

40:32.648 --> 40:33.748
Really?

40:34.111 --> 40:36.232
You check out her body?
It was pretty banging.

40:36.233 --> 40:38.649
Stay with me. Something's off here.

40:38.650 --> 40:39.844
No, no, no, no. That's what I'm saying.

40:39.845 --> 40:41.411
A woman with a physique like that

40:41.412 --> 40:42.986
doesn't cover it up to go
jogging... not in this heat.

40:44.048 --> 40:45.027
Not unless she's hiding something

40:45.028 --> 40:46.588
like scratches on her arms.

40:46.589 --> 40:48.019
She kills Kassar,

40:48.020 --> 40:49.520
then sits on the place next door

40:49.521 --> 40:50.987
to see if anyone comes knocking.

41:06.568 --> 41:10.624
Every precaution you take
to make something more secure

41:10.625 --> 41:13.312
also makes it less accessible.

41:13.313 --> 41:17.144
Concealing a high-density
tape cartridge behind drywall

41:17.145 --> 41:19.429
is a great way to keep
it from being found.

41:19.430 --> 41:20.797
She got away, man.

41:20.798 --> 41:22.431
We just blew a chance to end this thing.

41:22.432 --> 41:24.633
But if you ever have to leave in a hurry,

41:24.634 --> 41:26.231
you can't expect to take it with you.

41:26.232 --> 41:28.191
I don't know, Jesse. I think
we're just getting started.
