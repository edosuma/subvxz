This didn't happen. And
it” never happen again.

There's some
pinhead CSIS agent here.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.589

The truth is,
I'm the one that
sent you back in time.

00:58.643 --> 01:00.599
And you're not
going to believe why.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.688
You followed me?

01:06.776 --> 01:07.765
Where's Kagame?

01:07.860 --> 01:09.976
Kagame was in the building
when it exploded.

01:10.071 --> 01:13.563
He also told me that
after he died today,

01:13.658 --> 01:15.990
he wanted me
to do something
important.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.658
He wanted me
to succeed him.

pressure right now.

14:57.647 --> 14:58.727
Okay? The chief
just got fired

14:58.815 --> 15:01.022
so he's going to do
whatever it takes
to keep his job,

15:01.109 --> 15:02.315
not to mention mine.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.401
You're really both
on the line for this?

15:05.530 --> 15:07.395
Are you kidding me?

15:07.491 --> 15:09.573
lfwe don't figure out
who's behind the
mayor's assassination

15:09.659 --> 15:12.446
and quickly, we're both
out on our asses.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.990
All right.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.282
I'm gonna need access
to the mayor's
assassination files,

15:18.376 --> 15:21.584
photos, videos
and to the crime scene.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.252
Okay, I'll see
what I can do.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.505
Was the mayor
in the pocket
Of the corporations?

15:27.803 --> 15:29.259
Have you met
a politician that isn't?

15:29.346 --> 15:30.756
Okay, fine.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.633
Then who were her enemies?

15:32.724 --> 15:34.840
Well, she was
pushing a lot Of
anti-gang legislation,

15:34.976 --> 15:36.432
so any Of the organized
crime outfits

15:36.520 --> 15:38.181
would be pretty happy
to see her go.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.762
But those are bold
tactics for them.

15:40.857 --> 15:41.937
SO I got to say Liber8,

15:42.025 --> 15:43.526
they're trying to shake up
confidence in the system

15:43.610 --> 15:46.317
and targeting public
officials seems to be
doing the trick.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.655
Kiera, are you in or not?

15:51.701 --> 15:53.316
Just to clarify,

15:53.411 --> 15:55.276
you want me to bring
Liber8 to their knees,

15:55.372 --> 15:58.159
capture the mayor's killer
and help you keep yourjob?

15:59.709 --> 16:00.915
Easy!

16:07.843 --> 16:09.049
He's alive.

16:12.764 --> 16:15.551
Travis is alive.
He's in recovery
at a prison infirmary.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.553
Gunshot wounds
and broken ribs.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.016
We need to
organize a rescue.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.938
The mayor was just gunned
down in broad daylight,

16:24.025 --> 16:26.983
the last thing we need
is to be out in the Open.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.435
How many cells
do we have out there?

16:28.530 --> 16:30.987
One less, thanks to
the protector and her
actions last night.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.314
What are
the actual numbers?

16:32.409 --> 16:34.525
Half a dozen
Operational cells,

16:34.619 --> 16:36.280
half political,
half militant.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.667
Shut everything down.
But for how long?

16:44.880 --> 16:46.745
VVeH,aslong
asittakes.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.671
We wait for the dust
to settle, then we
get back on track.

16:48.758 --> 16:49.838
After we rescue Travis!

16:49.926 --> 16:50.915
I don't think
you heard me...

16:51.011 --> 16:52.467
Oh, am I missing
something here?

16:53.263 --> 16:55.345
We don't leave
soldiers behind!

16:56.975 --> 16:59.011
And who are you to
be issuing orders?

16:59.102 --> 17:00.057
Travis is still
in command...

17:00.145 --> 17:02.431
Travis got himself
shot and captured,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.103
he can't lead
from a prison.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.357
SO actually yes,
that does make me
ranking officer,

17:07.444 --> 17:09.150
do you have a problem
with that, Garza?

17:20.415 --> 17:22.781
Get me all the intel
you can on Travis.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.039
Security, anyone we have
on the inside, everything.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.704
Okay, so according
to forensics,

17:28.798 --> 17:30.413
the kill shot came
from approximately

17:30.508 --> 17:33.250
a 35-degree angle
in this direction
right here.

17:33.345 --> 17:36.553
Now, the shooter
could've been anywhere
from 100 to 1,000 meters

17:36.640 --> 17:37.880
depending on their skill.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.431
We've been canvassing
the area, but we still
don't have any leads.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.258
What about these
surveillance cameras?

17:42.354 --> 17:43.719
Ah, they're all pointed
in this direction

17:43.813 --> 17:45.724
so we have multiple angles
Of the mayor getting hit

17:45.815 --> 17:47.851
but almost none
looking the other way.

18:00.372 --> 18:04.081
Okay, you give me access
to the case files and
I'll get your shooter.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.992
(CHUCKLES)
You sound
pretty Optimistic.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.536
Any excuse
to see an old friend.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.422
Expenence
could be a problem.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.296
Well, lthought
this would be a great
place to get some.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.296
I'm not sure that
you've got what it takes.

18:19.391 --> 18:22.849
I'm not sure that you're
Memory Express material.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.098
ln here.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.646
lassure you
I do, I am...

18:28.733 --> 18:31.691
l'm great with
technical equipment,
people like me mostly.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.772
I'm a really hard worker
with some fresh ideas,

18:33.863 --> 18:35.069
I won't let you down.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.030
Well, I'll be
the judge Of that.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.111
That's for you.

18:47.711 --> 18:49.542
What can I do for
you, Agent Gardiner?

18:52.048 --> 18:53.037
Kiera Cameron.

18:54.884 --> 18:55.919
What about her?

18:57.679 --> 18:59.044
I'm looking for her.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.720
That makes two Of us.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.052
Well, I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me know

19:04.185 --> 19:06.312
when you make contact
with her, thank you.
And if I don't?

19:07.063 --> 19:08.223
I'm sorry, don't?

19:09.316 --> 19:11.272
Find her or don't make
contact with me ifyou do?

19:12.569 --> 19:13.604
Yes.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.024
I don't understand.
I can see that.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.981
Look, I'll make it
simple for you.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.318
You tell me why you're
looking for Cameron

19:22.412 --> 19:24.368
and then maybe I'll
tell you if I find her.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.001
You don't wanna
mess with me, Dillon.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.125
Actually it's your boss
and your agency
I don't wanna mess with.

19:36.092 --> 19:39.129
You make this personal,
I will mess with you
all day long.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.885
You're gonna have to do
better than this.

19:52.901 --> 19:54.266
That doesn't look good.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.857
Betty, I need a favor.
Shoot

19:58.948 --> 20:01.155
I need all the
available video from
the mayor's assassination.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.450
No problem, it's on
the server already.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.744
Including all
of the footage
from every source

20:06.831 --> 20:08.787
within a kilometer
Of the scene
in every direction.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.200
Uh”.lsuppose?

20:12.295 --> 20:14.832
Even the ones not pointed
at the mayor's assassination.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.790
I'm the geek in
this conversation

20:18.885 --> 20:20.841
and I don't understand
what you're up to.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.425
I can't really
talk about it.

20:25.517 --> 20:26.677
Okay.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.640
I'll have it all dumped
onto this for ya.

20:35.193 --> 20:36.774
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

20:50.500 --> 20:51.785
Shit.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.255
(SIGHS)

21:27.203 --> 21:28.192
(DOOR OPENS)

21:28.830 --> 21:30.240
There's some lady
here to see you.

21:30.331 --> 21:31.662
Uh, I'm busy.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.828
Dude, I'm not your
freakin' butler.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.783
You wanna turf her,
do it yourself.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.833
Fine, let's get
this over with.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.135
Mom!
Alec.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.507
Hey.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.508
I got to run.
Nice to meet ya.

21:52.604 --> 21:53.593
You too.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.647
Um, let's go outside.

22:00.904 --> 22:02.269
Sorry I never called.

22:05.533 --> 22:08.366
I noticed you put
all your father's
equipment in storage.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.243
Yeah, it's temporary.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.160
VVhy?

22:12.582 --> 22:13.697
Why is it temporary?

22:13.791 --> 22:15.952
No, why all of this?

22:16.044 --> 22:17.659
Leaving home so suddenly,

22:17.754 --> 22:21.588
giving up your work,
living like this.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.343
I can't explain that.

22:25.637 --> 22:27.343
You're all I have left,
you know.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.590
ljust... ljust want
my boy back.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.679
Mom, I'm not a boy anymore.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.018
Look, l have to do this.

22:36.773 --> 22:40.561
l have to make my own way
for myself, it's not for
you or Roland, or anyone.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.102
Look, I have my reasons.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.070
Look, I better get going.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.410
Of course.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.033
Maybe we can have
coffee sometime.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.284
I'd like that.

22:58.253 --> 23:00.335
Yeah, I, uh...

23:01.130 --> 23:02.711
lsuppose
I should go.

23:04.634 --> 23:05.794
Okay.

23:06.427 --> 23:07.633
Bye, Mom.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.904
I'm such an asshole.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.451
Shit.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.083
Oh, that bitch!

24:02.609 --> 24:03.598
Kiera?

24:04.819 --> 24:07.026
I thought that might
get your attention.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.354
Are we really resorting to
this level of behavior?

24:10.283 --> 24:12.569
Look, I have work to do.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.742
If you don't wanna help me,
you wanna avoid me, fine.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.236
I will work around you.

24:16.789 --> 24:17.778
What did you upload?

24:17.999 --> 24:19.239
A nasty virus.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.036
Seriously?
No.

24:21.544 --> 24:24.707
Surveillance footage
I need uploaded
into my CMR.

24:24.797 --> 24:25.957
You wanna help?

24:26.966 --> 24:28.297
You know what
I'm gonna say.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.967
Alec, you're
overthinking
the message.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.715
When you get a message
from your future self,

24:32.805 --> 24:34.136
telling you what my
future self told me,

24:34.223 --> 24:35.633
then we can have
this conversation.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.090
But until then
I think this situation

24:37.185 --> 24:38.891
deserves a little
overthinking.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.518
Okay, point taken.

24:42.273 --> 24:43.979
How's the job hunt going?

24:46.110 --> 24:48.362
I'm sorry, is that
a touchy subject also?

24:49.489 --> 24:50.820
Look, do you want
my help or not?

24:50.907 --> 24:52.022
Yes, please.

24:52.367 --> 24:53.732
lthoughtso.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.228
Whoa, what did you do?

25:25.316 --> 25:28.308
/ reconstructed
the exact moment
of the assassination

25:28.403 --> 25:31.611
using 360 degrees of available
surveillance footage.

25:40.581 --> 25:41.616
The kill shot.

25:46.129 --> 25:48.541
Is this how they solve
murders in 2077?

25:48.631 --> 25:51.589
There are very few
murders in 2077.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.221
I can see why.

26:16.492 --> 26:17.527
There.

26:20.121 --> 26:22.032
Third from the top,
muzzle flash.

26:22.707 --> 26:26.370
Based on telemetry,
I've got an address.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.374
It's nice to
have you back, Alec.

26:31.674 --> 26:33.960
I'm not back,
I'm just bored.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.797
Yeah, right.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.628
(GUN COCKING)
Stay where
you are, Cameron.

27:21.516 --> 27:22.881
What are you doing here?

27:23.810 --> 27:27.143
Same thing you are,
trying to find
the mayor's killer.

27:27.230 --> 27:29.391
Assuming that is what
you're doing here.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.651
What are you doing here?

27:34.237 --> 27:36.398
You're gonna answer
some questions.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.279
About what?

27:39.033 --> 27:40.944
The City Plaza bombing.

27:41.035 --> 27:42.696
About what happened
afterwards.

27:44.247 --> 27:45.953
I saw you,
I saw...

27:48.668 --> 27:51.284
I saw you survive
the explosion
and the fireball,

27:53.464 --> 27:54.579
and then vanish.

27:56.509 --> 27:57.840
Yeah, that.

28:03.057 --> 28:06.675
I'm a stranded
time traveler
from the year 2077,

28:07.645 --> 28:10.182
using technology
that hasn't even
been invented yet.

28:10.273 --> 28:11.353
That's bullshit.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.226
SO is there anything else
you'd like to talk about?

28:13.317 --> 28:14.432
Yes.

28:15.278 --> 28:18.236
I wanna know about
the mayor, Liber8...

28:21.284 --> 28:22.945
Tell me about Alec Sadler.

28:25.162 --> 28:27.699
This place is a distraction.

28:28.499 --> 28:29.784
Liber8 didn't kill
the mayor,

28:29.876 --> 28:32.208
but there's somebody
who really wants you
to think they did.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.043
Really?

28:39.468 --> 28:40.969
Hey, Kiera.
I got your message.

28:42.471 --> 28:43.551
Gardiner?

28:43.639 --> 28:44.799
What's going on here?

28:45.850 --> 28:50.469
The agent and l were
just discussing some
possible scenarios.

28:56.277 --> 28:57.483
We're not done.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.566
Well, this looks
like a Liber8 nest.

29:02.116 --> 29:05.859
Who stands to gain
the most if Liber8
takes the heat for this?

29:05.953 --> 29:09.912
Well, there's uh,
political rivals,
organized crime...

29:09.999 --> 29:13.287
I don't know, there might
even be an ex-husband
out there with a beef.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.827
You Okay?
Yeah.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.208
The other night,
one Of the Liber8 thugs

29:18.299 --> 29:21.757
had a split skull
tattoo on his head.

29:21.844 --> 29:22.833
What does that mean?

29:23.179 --> 29:26.296
That's uh, gang ink.
Coalition Kings.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.926
Rumor has it they've been
working with Liber8.

29:28.017 --> 29:30.474
Okay, then who's
their rival gang?

29:30.561 --> 29:31.641
Who would be the most upset

29:31.729 --> 29:33.765
to find out that
the Coalition Kings
were working

29:33.856 --> 29:35.517
with the big, bad Liber8?

29:36.025 --> 29:37.435
You know you may be
on to something.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.357
Wolford has been bitching
about city policies

29:39.445 --> 29:41.106
regarding his
nightclub businesses.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.186
Wolford?

29:42.281 --> 29:45.648
Uh, Raul Wolford,
he's the head Of
the organization.

29:46.369 --> 29:48.781
We picked him up
on some minor raps

29:48.871 --> 29:51.704
but somehow
he always manages
to beat the process.

29:53.376 --> 29:55.583
Good thing I'm not
part Of the process.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.286
Hey Martinez, it's Fonnegra.

29:59.382 --> 30:00.622
I'm gonna text you
an address.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.627
ljust wanna know
if it's associated
with Wolford

30:02.718 --> 30:03.878
or the West Coast Syndicate.

30:04.387 --> 30:05.547
All right, thanks.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.050
SO what do you wanna do?

30:09.600 --> 30:12.216
I probably
shouldn't tell you,
for your own protection.

30:12.937 --> 30:15.644
Look, just give me
a jump on Wolford

30:15.731 --> 30:18.143
before you issue
the warrant, please.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.987
Okay, there's some
drawbacks to this approach.

30:22.071 --> 30:25.234
Uh, legally speaking,
not to mention these
scumbags are dangerous.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.486
Carlos, I can take
care Of myself

30:28.577 --> 30:31.569
and you need to
keep your hands clean,
you know that.

30:34.709 --> 30:36.825

you can start there.

30:36.919 --> 30:38.580
Thank you.

30:38.671 --> 30:39.751

30:40.756 --> 30:43.498
Yeah, is it gonna be
a big bat projected
into the night sky?

30:46.429 --> 30:47.418

Hey kid, I've got some
good news for you.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.279
You got the job.

31:09.118 --> 31:11.825
Oh, uh, thank you!
See you tomorrow.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.452
We lost.
Who was that?

31:18.044 --> 31:19.329
I got the computer
store gig.

31:19.503 --> 31:20.583
Sweet!

31:20.671 --> 31:22.127
Now you can pay me
the rent you owe.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.626
I'm just kidding.

31:24.717 --> 31:26.207
That's awesome, that's
what you wanted right?

31:26.302 --> 31:28.258
Yeah, yeah sure.

What do you got?
Wolford and the Syndicate

Gun room,
snooping around.

32:53.681 --> 32:56.844
I need to search
this club, your vehicle
and your residence.

32:56.934 --> 32:58.299
Really?

32:58.394 --> 33:00.225
And then I need to
take you in for
the mayor's assassination.

33:00.563 --> 33:03.350
This just keeps
getting better and
better all the time.

33:03.440 --> 33:06.273
Tell me, what is it
that I have to do
with the mayor?

33:06.443 --> 33:08.820
The shooter
used your apartment.

33:09.613 --> 33:11.023
My apartment?
No.

33:11.115 --> 33:14.573
There's nothing in
this city with his name
on it, that's impossible.

What else you got?

33:21.417 --> 33:22.577
You're telling the truth.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.033
I always tell the truth.

33:25.004 --> 33:28.872
Watch this.
Take her out back
and kill her.

33:28.966 --> 33:30.251
No,no,no!
Wait, wait, wait!

33:30.342 --> 33:32.503
Listen, they had to have
someone on the inside!

33:32.595 --> 33:34.005
Someone with access
to your place!

33:34.096 --> 33:35.427
You have a rival gang,
what are they?

33:35.556 --> 33:38.093
The Coalition?
Something like that.
Hold up!

33:40.227 --> 33:41.216
Let her finish.

33:42.813 --> 33:45.350
What is this you're saying
about the Coalition Kings?

33:45.441 --> 33:48.399
Somebody went to
an awful lot Of
trouble to implicate

33:48.485 --> 33:51.727
yourgangin
the assassination
Of the mayor.

33:51.822 --> 33:53.403
They sent me after you.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.697
They stand to gain
in a number of ways.

33:57.119 --> 33:59.110
Well, lwouldn't
cry about it.

33:59.997 --> 34:01.703
SO what you're saying
is we have a problem?

34:01.790 --> 34:02.950
Nobody move!

34:03.542 --> 34:04.918
Put your guns down!

34:07.129 --> 34:08.665
Put the guns down.

34:10.549 --> 34:11.709
This stinks.

34:21.977 --> 34:25.219
SO the ballistics
on this rifle
should match the round

34:25.314 --> 34:29.148
that took out the mayor,
and the prints on this
shell casing are...

34:29.652 --> 34:31.313
Oh! They're yours,
Mr. Wolford.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.565
You boys are really
reaching, huh?

34:34.657 --> 34:36.898
I've never seen
this rifle in my life.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.741
That's weird,
because we found it
in your gun safe

34:39.828 --> 34:41.489
in your office,
in your nightclub.

34:43.457 --> 34:44.742
I want my lawyer.

34:45.584 --> 34:48.576
See, the thing is,
we called your lawyer,
but, uh...

34:49.380 --> 34:51.166
Apparently he's unavailable
because he got picked up

34:51.257 --> 34:53.589
on some Obstruction
ofjustice charges.

34:53.676 --> 34:55.041
Right, right.
SO, uh...

34:55.594 --> 34:58.336
I don't know,
is there another lawyer
that we can call?

35:02.476 --> 35:03.511
Right.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.431
Put him in a holding,

35:06.522 --> 35:08.433
we'll get you

in the morning.

35:08.524 --> 35:09.980
Oh, you know
you're wrong!

35:10.067 --> 35:11.603
You know
you're wrong, right?

35:11.694 --> 35:13.901
Hey, you know,
you're wrong!

35:17.116 --> 35:18.196
Kiera?

35:18.575 --> 35:19.564
Alec.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.703
I’ve been thinking...

35:22.746 --> 35:23.735
I know.

35:24.123 --> 35:25.704
NO, not about that.

35:26.709 --> 35:27.698
I need to see you.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.250
Okay, what's going on?

35:30.963 --> 35:36.208
The future.
Not 2077 future,
just right now future.

35:37.553 --> 35:38.838
It sounds serious.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.340
It is.

35:41.223 --> 35:42.463
I'll come meet you,

35:42.558 --> 35:45.550
just let me take care
Of something first.

35:46.603 --> 35:48.264
All right, thanks.

35:52.735 --> 35:55.602
Agent Cameron, good work.

35:55.696 --> 35:57.402
Does this mean
you're back in the fold?

35:58.324 --> 36:02.738
The fight that we're facing
requires a little
outside the box thinking.

36:03.203 --> 36:04.238
I agree.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.911
I'm more effective
if I can avoid

36:05.998 --> 36:08.114
department restrictions
and oversight.

36:08.667 --> 36:12.285
Yet, maintain
your support and access
to your resources.

36:12.671 --> 36:16.584
Nothing sticks to you
or the department
and I'm on my own.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.004
CARLOS: You know,
I'm not so sure
about this.

36:19.887 --> 36:21.548
All right, Wolford still
needs to stand trial

36:21.638 --> 36:25.472
and if his defense gets
wind of Kiera's tactics,
the charges may not stick.

36:25.601 --> 36:28.559
Right now perception
is more important than
the letter Of the law.

36:28.645 --> 36:32.229
Wolford gets charged,
we parade him
in front of the press,

36:32.316 --> 36:34.181
the city sees
we're in control
Of the situation.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.233
And what if Wolford
walks on a technicality?

36:37.321 --> 36:39.653
Let's say he does,
those bastards out there

36:39.740 --> 36:41.731
will have to think
twice before they
make another move.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.618
Maybe it buys us
some time.

36:44.453 --> 36:47.115
None of this is gonna
matter ifwhat I'm
thinking is right.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.112
What do you mean?

36:49.208 --> 36:51.950
We have to face
the possibility that
Wolford had nothing to do

36:52.044 --> 36:53.454
with the mayor's killing.

36:55.506 --> 36:57.588
If not Wolford, then who?

37:02.638 --> 37:03.923
SONYA: Candidate Martin,

37:04.973 --> 37:07.055
how is that mayoral
campaign coming?

37:07.142 --> 37:10.054
Just kicked into high gear,
now that an election is
right around the corner.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.056
I guess I have you
to thank for that.

37:12.147 --> 37:13.398
Oh no, you can
thank Garza.

37:13.482 --> 37:14.642
She's the one who
pulled the trigger.

37:15.025 --> 37:18.142
We used gang members
to plant the evidence...
I don't wanna know.

37:18.946 --> 37:20.527
Deniability and such.

37:20.614 --> 37:21.854
Oh, but I insist.

37:22.616 --> 37:26.200
You wanted this Mr. Martin.
There are no half measures.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.662
You are either all in,

37:28.497 --> 37:30.738
or you have no use
to us or the movement.

37:34.044 --> 37:35.159
You're right.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.077
Greatjob!

37:37.464 --> 37:39.250
Putting the blame on
a scumbag like Wolford

37:39.341 --> 37:40.922
raises it to
a whole new level.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.796
Well, two for one
in my books.

37:46.181 --> 37:49.844
We will be counting
on your support,
Mr. Mayor.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.019
You will have it.

38:10.247 --> 38:11.737
Are we, uh...
Are we good?

38:13.834 --> 38:14.914
You tell me.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.035
You look like you could
use some protection.

38:25.721 --> 38:27.052
You just get here?

38:27.973 --> 38:29.213
ldid.

38:29.766 --> 38:32.894
I spent the last couple
of weeks in a prison
hospital recovering.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.638
Recovering from what?

38:36.440 --> 38:37.680
Sonya.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.657
These two inmates
should not be in
the same facility,

38:48.744 --> 38:50.905
let alone
be allowed to mingle.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.736
It's a violation of
standard procedure.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.823
Well, my office needs intel

38:55.918 --> 38:59.581
and we're not gonna
let procedure
interfere with that.

39:02.424 --> 39:06.133
Alec, you don't know
if his message was
manipulation or genuine.

39:06.595 --> 39:09.086
Well, from what you know
about me in the future,
what would you guess?

39:12.643 --> 39:14.679
I'd say it's
a 50-50 proposition.

39:15.771 --> 39:19.138
Look, future you
didn't get where he
did by playing nice

39:19.233 --> 39:21.474
and being transparent
about his intentions.

39:22.444 --> 39:24.685
He's a powerful man
and he protects that power.

39:25.072 --> 39:27.313
This whole thing
is making me crazy.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.693
I mean, I want to help you,
I know you're trying
to do the right thing.

39:29.785 --> 39:32.822
I just don't know
whether or not I'm working
against the message.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.912
What about me?
You?

39:36.667 --> 39:37.952
Yes, me.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.253
Why am I here?

39:40.337 --> 39:42.373
Why did you send me back?

39:43.590 --> 39:44.670
I don't know.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.918
You think you're
the only one
with questions?

40:03.402 --> 40:05.563
What are you doing?
Take it.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.485
Maybe you can
figure out how it works,

40:11.618 --> 40:13.233
reverse engineer it
into something useful

40:13.328 --> 40:14.864
and send me back
where I belong.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.741
That might take some time.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.744
Time is all I seem
to have right now.

40:25.507 --> 40:29.045
The future you didn't
say anything about
not helping me, did he?

40:35.517 --> 40:38.634
Look, I got to work
in the morning
so I should split.

40:41.231 --> 40:42.346
We good?

40:43.942 --> 40:46.058
Sure.
I got your back.

40:46.153 --> 40:47.563
Thanks, Alec.

40:47.654 --> 40:48.689
See ya.

40:53.327 --> 40:56.034
What are you
up to, old man?

41:45.379 --> 41:49.122
I speak to you,
not as who you'll become,

41:50.509 --> 41:52.249
but as an old man
who knows you best.

41:53.804 --> 41:55.965
You and I were given
a gift from our father.

41:56.932 --> 41:59.890
He died young,
but he imparted in us

41:59.976 --> 42:03.013
a passion for technology
andinnovaﬂon.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.430
What you need to know,

42:07.693 --> 42:09.524
what I tried to do...

42:15.450 --> 42:17.441
Listen to me
carefully, Alec.

42:21.206 --> 42:24.539
I have gone down
a dangerous path

42:24.626 --> 42:27.618
and I have taken
the world with me.

42:29.464 --> 42:34.834
Only you can prevent
this future
from happening.

43:11.381 --> 43:12.882
No!
