00:01.369 --> 00:04.072
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:04.105 --> 00:06.174
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.542
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:08.576 --> 00:11.579
but at a terrible cost.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.582
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:14.615 --> 00:16.750
a secretive group called
the Shepherds released a gas

00:16.784 --> 00:20.621
that sterilized all of humanity.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.623
And then,
lab-made creatures called "hybrids"

00:22.656 --> 00:25.126
devastated the West Coast,

00:25.159 --> 00:26.660
so a massive barrier
was constructed

00:26.694 --> 00:29.430
to protect the rest
of North America.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.433
But new breeds have
started to appear,

00:32.466 --> 00:34.502
so we reassembled our team.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.770
We battle on many fronts,

00:36.804 --> 00:39.140
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:39.173 --> 00:41.542
while racing to stop the hybrids

00:41.575 --> 00:43.211
and the rogue Shepherd
who created them

00:43.244 --> 00:45.679
to end the human race.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.382
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.783
(roaring)

00:49.817 --> 00:51.319
Previously on Zoo...

00:51.352 --> 00:52.453
I had a family once.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.687
A wife and a son.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.723
They died in an explosion.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.625
Abe's the only one
alive who knows.

00:58.626 --> 00:59.693
Mitch!

01:00.861 --> 01:01.861
Max?

01:02.763 --> 01:05.266
Sorry about that, son.

01:05.299 --> 01:08.636
Four hikers were found dead in
the Black Forest in Germany.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.672
It's a mystery,
one we'd like you to help us solve.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.807
Your baby has HDF.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.710
It won't survive if it doesn't
get a blood transfusion

01:16.744 --> 01:18.479
in the next three days.
What about the tank?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.581
CLEMENTINE: If it'll save my
baby, I'll do it.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.316
Hello, brother.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.552
You have something I need.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.421
Jackson has a lead on someone
who might be Abigail's partner.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.423
JAMIE: It's a surveillance
photo of Mr. Duncan.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.168
Let me know when the
program's done with the image.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.161
You're Mr. Duncan.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.196
I'm gonna tell the
rest of the team.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.230
(gasps)

01:37.798 --> 01:38.798
Mitch.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.311
ABIGAIL: Rise and
shine, brother.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.613
(chains rattling)

01:52.646 --> 01:55.383
(grunting)

01:58.486 --> 01:59.887
Abigail.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.727
What is this place?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.196
Where are we?

02:08.229 --> 02:09.363
Copenhagen.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.199
What?

02:11.232 --> 02:12.833
Why?

02:12.866 --> 02:15.269
You'll find out soon enough.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.438
(grunts)

02:17.471 --> 02:19.807
I dreamed of meeting
you so many times.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.877
My infamous big brother.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.817
But I got to admit,
you're a bit of a disappointment.

02:31.885 --> 02:35.589
Well, so is finding out
your sister's a psychopath.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.258
Why are you spreading
the hybrids?

02:37.291 --> 02:40.194
You wouldn't understand.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.563
Help me understand.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.299
You want to end the world. Why?

02:48.269 --> 02:49.803
(beep, electronic whirring)

02:52.773 --> 02:54.708
You know what's funny?

02:57.278 --> 02:59.847
My father never
told me about you.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.217
Why is that?

03:05.519 --> 03:08.689
Robert Oz kept many secrets.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.291
Especially from his children.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.860
You don't have to do
this, Abigail.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.329
Whatever your plan
is, it's not too late.

03:15.363 --> 03:19.700
Tell me how to stop the
hybrids, and I will help you.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.645
Oh, Jackson,
do you really think I brought you here

03:21.669 --> 03:23.571
so that we could have
a heart-to-heart?

03:23.604 --> 03:25.673
Brother to sister?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.675
So you could convince me of

03:27.708 --> 03:28.976
the error of my ways?

03:29.009 --> 03:30.544
Save my soul?

03:30.578 --> 03:31.845
No.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.715
You're here for one reason:

03:34.748 --> 03:36.917
your ability to communicate
with the animal kingdom.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.358
I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.427
MAX: Why in the world
did you do this?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.329
MITCH: Will you just
keep your voice down

03:48.362 --> 03:49.830
and trust me for once.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.699
You just stabbed your
girlfriend in the neck

03:51.732 --> 03:53.434
with my tranquilizer dart.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.369
I think I deserve some answers.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.381
Well, I deserved a childhood
free from chupacabra stakeouts,

03:57.405 --> 03:58.515
but we don't always get what we want.
Hey...

03:58.539 --> 03:59.907
Hey, hey, hey.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.742
We saw the chupacabra
in Texarkana.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.444
You saw a chupacabra.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.979
I'm pretty sure that
was peyote-induced.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.014
Hey.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.609
Aunt Jamie can't
really hold her liquor.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.741
I think it's time to tell
me what's going on, son.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.933
Shh.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.345
If the team finds out what I've
done, I will lose everything.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.780
I'll lose Clem, Jamie.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.081
Everything.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.451
So you're gonna promise me

04:43.484 --> 04:45.386
you're not gonna tell anybody.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.654
Okay?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.055
Okay.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.526
For the last ten years,

04:52.560 --> 04:54.662
I was not in that
tank the whole time.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.664
Somebody used me.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.070
They were controlling
my brain to do...

05:03.103 --> 05:06.407
evil, bad guy stuff.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.975
Then why wipe her memory?

05:08.008 --> 05:09.853
And why-why are you dealing
with all this alone?

05:09.877 --> 05:12.045
Because I'm not ready yet.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.782
Until I fully understand what's going
on, I can't risk it.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.984
This is Jamie.
You telling me you don't trust her?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.786
There's more to it than
that, Max, okay?

05:18.819 --> 05:19.863
There's something in my head.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.555
A bio-drive.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.890
Okay.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.725
Then we take care
of it immediately.

05:24.758 --> 05:25.859
We already tried.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.695
We try again. Max, it...

05:27.728 --> 05:29.539
No. You're telling me
there's a thing in your head,

05:29.563 --> 05:31.765
this can change you and force
you to do terrible things?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.434
Then we take care of it.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.968
And I know just how to do it.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.507
You may be able to
hide from your friends

05:39.540 --> 05:42.075
or from the rest of the world,

05:42.109 --> 05:44.011
but I know who you really are.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.345
What you're really capable of.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.484
With these?

05:50.518 --> 05:52.653
They let me know you're lying.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.022
I'm telling you,

05:55.055 --> 05:57.425
I have no idea what
you are talking about.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.729
(scoffs) Okay.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.932
Then you won't mind indulging
me in this little exercise.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.940
(panting)

06:16.477 --> 06:18.788
After three days without food,
a Bengal tiger is hungry enough

06:18.812 --> 06:21.048
to eat a man on sight.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.583
(tiger snarling)

06:22.616 --> 06:24.752
And their favorite
scent is antelope blood.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.720
(roars)

06:29.757 --> 06:31.492
(growling)

06:40.568 --> 06:42.102
(growling)

06:57.585 --> 06:59.119
(groaning)

07:03.557 --> 07:05.826
Now that you've proven my point,

07:05.859 --> 07:07.795
shall we begin?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.102
â™ª

07:27.214 --> 07:30.050
You know, I've seen the
pictures, but...

07:30.083 --> 07:32.920
being here, inside the
barrier, it's something else.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.555
They said it couldn't be done.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.724
A wall to contain the hybrids

07:36.757 --> 07:39.860
that extends the length
of North America.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.530
Welcome to Barrier Command.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.864
Wow.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.001
It's our tax dollars at work.

07:48.035 --> 07:51.539
We're the world's final defense
against the hybrid threat,

07:51.572 --> 07:54.174
keeping track of any
and all hybrid activity

07:54.207 --> 07:56.143
across the globe.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.911
Detective.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.947
Corporal Lee.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.049
You're not what I pictured
from how you're described

08:02.082 --> 08:04.117
in Ms. Campbell's novel.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.953
It's good to meet you, too.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.289
You both will be working
on our top priority.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.725
The Black Forest, Germany.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.136
Where four hikers died
from massive hemorrhaging.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.996
Trace hybrid DNA
found in their lungs.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.098
No idea how, no idea why.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.833
And that, Detective,
is precisely

08:19.867 --> 08:21.769
the mystery you will be solving.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.704
You'll find everything
you need inside.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.905
Welcome aboard.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.245
(jet engine whooshing)

08:32.279 --> 08:33.947
(Abraham moans)

08:33.981 --> 08:36.850
This was good.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.652
This was never the problem.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.661
But we have each other again.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.731
So you think everything's
back to normal?

08:52.299 --> 08:54.868
Isaac is back.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.637
Reiden is behind us.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.576
And we can begin to
be a family again.

09:02.610 --> 09:06.046
What does that look like to you?

09:06.079 --> 09:08.916
Raising Isaac on the plane?
Homeschooling him in the bar?

09:08.949 --> 09:13.854
Once Jackson gets
back with Sam Parker,

09:13.887 --> 09:16.824
we'll be one step closer
to solving sterility.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.827
And once we do...

09:19.860 --> 09:21.228
we'll go home.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.296
I promise.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.100
A new challenger
enters the ring!

09:27.134 --> 09:28.101
(laughs): Hey!

09:28.135 --> 09:29.637
Kenyatta vs. Kenyatta.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.904
(grunts)

09:30.938 --> 09:32.840
(both laughing)

09:32.873 --> 09:34.908
Say "mercy," say "mercy."

09:34.942 --> 09:36.744
You have to relent.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.378
You have to. Yeah!

09:38.411 --> 09:40.380
Body slam! Yeah!

09:40.413 --> 09:43.050
(Abraham and Isaac laughing)

09:43.083 --> 09:44.217
Hey.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.723
I got to tell you,
I do not think this is a great idea.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.995
What method did
you last attempt?

09:55.028 --> 09:56.764
Neuro bypass. Via?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.966
Swine.

09:58.999 --> 10:02.035
Wow. You're not a
half-bad scientist.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.037
Well, thanks, Dad.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.139
Only took me dying and
coming back to life

10:06.173 --> 10:07.975
for you to give me a
little acknowledgement.

10:08.008 --> 10:12.379
Well... you say what you
will, but I know my gadgets.

10:12.412 --> 10:15.816
And this is the summoning rod.
Please, no.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.385
Stick this in a body of water,
it emits electrical pulses.

10:18.418 --> 10:22.122
It's designed to summon
underwater beasts.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.157
So, you're thinking EMP. Yeah.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.859
Which could actually work.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.695
Yep.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.039
You got a crystal oscillator in that thing?
Yeah, of course.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.865
Fill this thing
with enough juice,

10:31.899 --> 10:33.867
you'll be able to fry that
bio-drive, no problemo.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.135
Huh? (chuckles)

10:35.168 --> 10:37.137
I can just hard-wire it

10:37.170 --> 10:39.206
straight into the plane's
electrical system.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.808
Ah, yeah, now we're talking.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.878
MITCH: I got a question.
MAX: Yeah?

10:44.912 --> 10:46.055
You've done this before, right?

10:46.079 --> 10:47.047
(electrical whirring)

10:47.080 --> 10:50.383
On a living human... no.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.288
(plane rumbles)

11:05.799 --> 11:07.334
(tablet beeping steadily)

11:14.507 --> 11:17.444
What?

11:17.477 --> 11:19.713
(plane rumbling,
engines whirring)

11:28.121 --> 11:30.057
Mom?

11:30.090 --> 11:31.224
It's okay.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.425
I'll find Jamie.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.930
I'm gonna hit you with
a pulse three times.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.474
Is this gonna be safe to do
with all this turbulence?

11:38.498 --> 11:40.033
Barely safe without turbulence.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.969
First pulse is gonna
hurt something fierce.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.146
Second one could have some
unintended side effects.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.172
What kind of side effects?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.908
Very minor.
Care to be more specific?

11:47.941 --> 11:49.786
Doesn't matter because the third
pulse is gonna clear it all up

11:49.810 --> 11:50.944
and fry the bio-drive.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.880
Ready? As one could be.

11:52.913 --> 11:53.847
(electricity crackles,
Mitch grunts)

11:53.881 --> 11:55.448
Ow!

11:55.482 --> 11:57.317
That's one. (chuckles)

11:57.350 --> 11:58.518
(electricity crackles)

11:58.551 --> 11:59.920
(grunts)

11:59.953 --> 12:01.955
Two.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.257
Um, hey. Yeah?

12:04.291 --> 12:07.527
Um, M-M-Max, I can't, I...
I can't see anything.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.830
Well, like I said,
some minor side effects.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.940
You could've
mentioned blindness.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.232
Minor blindness.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.034
This all goes away
with pulse three.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.103
(plane rumbling)

12:16.136 --> 12:18.105
Oh, that's not good.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.472
What? Hey, g...

12:19.506 --> 12:20.874
Pulse three.
Where's pulse three?

12:20.908 --> 12:22.409
Minor speed bump.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.543
Max?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.813
Something doesn't feel right.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.180
Mitch?

12:29.382 --> 12:30.984
What's going on?

12:31.018 --> 12:32.920
Something's wrong with
the main battery unit.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.422
(plane rumbling)

12:35.455 --> 12:38.992
Random malfunctions,
navigational errors

12:39.026 --> 12:42.896
and...
and the power is going out.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.132
The plane's trying to
conserve its battery.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.233
It's going into safe mode.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.835
Safe mode?

12:47.868 --> 12:49.436
It basically just
files in a circle

12:49.469 --> 12:50.947
until we fix the problem.
(tablet beeps)

12:50.971 --> 12:53.974
And there's the problem.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.509
Okay. It's probably
just some faulty wiring,

12:56.543 --> 12:58.846
but give me a hand, will you?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.347
Yeah.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.450
(steady beeping)

13:13.360 --> 13:16.096
That's an unexpected
development.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.103
JAMIE: This is
gonna sound weird,

13:23.136 --> 13:25.338
but do you know what I
was doing last night?

13:25.372 --> 13:26.907
You can't remember?

13:26.940 --> 13:29.076
I think I was with
Mitch, but it's hazy.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.610
That's weird.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.345
Honestly,
I didn't see you last night.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.981
I was having a family reunion.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.249
Oh.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.417
DARIELA: What the hell?

13:41.554 --> 13:45.025
Okay, let's keep moving.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.327
How do you control the
animals, Jackson?

13:51.131 --> 13:54.467
Tell me how or I'll
kill your friends.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.347
Look familiar?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.482
When I was on board,

14:09.516 --> 14:13.286
I thought it needed a
little je ne sais quoi.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.456
What did you do?

14:16.489 --> 14:18.658
Tell me how you
control the animals

14:18.691 --> 14:22.429
or I will bring your plane and
everyone on it crashing down.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.469
(steady beeping)

14:29.502 --> 14:31.471
Access to the main
battery unit's down here.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.581
(hissing)

14:44.217 --> 14:45.518
(loud thumping)

14:45.552 --> 14:46.553
We have a problem.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.064
What did you do?

14:57.097 --> 15:00.600
Right now my hybrid is
causing irreparable damage

15:00.633 --> 15:02.302
to the plane's
electrical system.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.272
But that could all stop.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.074
Just tell me how you
control the animals.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.308
I don't know.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.576
You're lying to me.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.578
I do not know.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.314
Friends are gonna
drop from the sky.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.915
I don't know!

15:21.054 --> 15:22.398
JAMIE (over P.A.): Everyone
regroup in the galley.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.291
We have a hybrid on the plane.

15:24.324 --> 15:27.394
Sure. Why not?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.963
Uh, hey, listen,

15:29.997 --> 15:32.665
don't say anything to
anybody about my condition.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.335
It's gonna open
up a can of worms.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.638
Well, like I always said,
honesty is the best policy.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.408
You have never once said that.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.310
Maybe not out loud.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.279
Just don't say anything to
anybody, okay? Please.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.181
Gonna need verbal
confirmation here, Max.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.150
Okay.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.155
Well, we found what's
causing the power drain:

15:55.188 --> 15:57.457
a new hybrid wrapped around
the main battery unit.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.292
Oh, that's the,
uh, that's the spot

15:59.326 --> 16:00.669
when you go down the,
uh, spiral staircase

16:00.693 --> 16:04.231
and you take a left past
the breakfast nook...

16:04.264 --> 16:06.299
It secretes some sort of
fluid from its tentacles.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.077
Some sea creatures have
been known to generate

16:08.101 --> 16:10.703
a weak electrical field
through the mucus membranes.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.548
Must be creating interference
with the battery.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.141
What about power to Clem's tank?

16:14.174 --> 16:15.575
We should be good for now.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.444
I diverted power
from another battery.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.587
If there are no more
major malfunctions...

16:18.611 --> 16:20.780
And that's a big if...

16:20.813 --> 16:22.382
We'll have power for
another two hours.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.451
Max, you're gonna have
to wait a little longer

16:24.484 --> 16:26.053
to get home to Helsinki.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.720
In order to regain
control of the plane,

16:27.754 --> 16:29.622
I need to reboot
the entire system,

16:29.656 --> 16:31.391
and I can't do that
with this creature

16:31.424 --> 16:32.559
wrapped around the battery.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.261
There may be another option.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.129
We create a weak beacon signal,

16:36.163 --> 16:39.299
pinpoint the creature and
draw it out into the open.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.567
It's too dangerous.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.178
We can't risk it being
loose on the plane.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.303
Dariela and I can access

16:43.336 --> 16:45.105
the service duct
in the vehicle bay

16:45.138 --> 16:46.306
and come at it from the rear.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.407
We'll kill the hybrid.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.142
You guys reboot the plane.

16:49.176 --> 16:52.079
A spinal fluid draw from
a live subject would be

16:52.112 --> 16:53.113
the best option. Abe.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.814
Look, I know this is dangerous,

16:54.847 --> 16:57.617
but we only have
two hybrids left.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.452
And since the two
previous samples

16:59.486 --> 17:01.354
came from deceased hybrids,

17:01.388 --> 17:03.723
I'm worried about
the serum's efficacy.

17:03.756 --> 17:07.727
Solving sterility may depend
on getting the spinal fluid

17:07.760 --> 17:10.063
while it is still alive.
He's right.

17:10.097 --> 17:13.366
Well, none of this matters if we
can't keep the plane in the air.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.567
So, we'll clear the hybrid

17:14.601 --> 17:16.836
using nonlethal
means if possible.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.505
Someone's gonna
need to stay here

17:18.538 --> 17:20.573
and prep the system for reboot.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.175
Uh, Max and I will do that.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.343
Great.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.711
Abe, final step.

17:24.743 --> 17:25.712
You need to throw
this master switch.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.247
It's in the bar,

17:27.280 --> 17:28.715
behind the control panel. Okay.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.850
And the comms are down,

17:30.883 --> 17:32.719
so everyone needs an earpiece.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.292
Are you sure you want to
be using live ammunition?

17:39.326 --> 17:41.461
Don't worry,
I had the fuselage reinforced.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.863
Hey, I can't remember anything
that happened last night.

17:43.896 --> 17:44.896
It's a blank.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.269
Oh. Weird.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.704
Mitch, look me in the eye.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.273
I am looking you in the eye.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.346
You know, you know,
this-this reminds me of the time

17:55.375 --> 17:57.877
that I was in American
Samoa over spring break,

17:57.910 --> 17:59.312
and that's real... Yeah, thanks.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.847
(plane rumbling)

18:00.880 --> 18:04.451
(tablet beeping)

18:04.484 --> 18:07.820
JAMIE: Okay, let's move.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.259
JACKSON: If I could
tell you what you want,

18:12.292 --> 18:14.727
how do I know you wouldn't
just kill them anyway?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.497
You killed a lot of my
friends in Portland.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.833
That was my vanity taking hold.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.236
I wanted to watch you bleed.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.605
Then watch me bleed.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.574
I'm right here.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.343
Do what you want with me.

18:30.377 --> 18:31.811
Just leave them out of it.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.746
No, it's bigger than that now.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.682
It's bigger than just you.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.251
I've spent the last ten years

18:38.285 --> 18:40.420
creating new species of hybrids

18:40.453 --> 18:43.556
and spreading them
across the globe.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.426
They're all just
waiting to be awakened.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.629
We stopped the
apocalypse before.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.664
We can do it again.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.600
We'll see.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.604
(snoring)

19:01.808 --> 19:04.511
MAX: How much longer are
we gonna keep up this ruse?

19:04.544 --> 19:06.346
Oh, you call this a ruse?

19:06.379 --> 19:07.780
You were terrible.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.816
Well, considering
that I just found out

19:09.849 --> 19:11.818
my son has an evil alter ego,

19:11.851 --> 19:13.620
(chuckles) I think
I did pretty good.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.422
Can we just skip to the part

19:15.455 --> 19:17.190
where you get my
eyeballs working again?

19:17.224 --> 19:20.460
So, are the blood
vessels constricted?

19:20.493 --> 19:23.496
Mm... yeah, looks that way.

19:23.530 --> 19:27.600
Great. Could take hours for the
proper blood flow to return.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.270
Well... just be thankful

19:30.303 --> 19:32.639
that your father is
at risk of angina.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.907
So, yeah...
do carry blood thinners.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.918
Dad, what's going on?

19:45.952 --> 19:48.321
Everything's going to be okay.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.690
We're just helping Auntie
Jamie fix the plane.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.526
But I need you to stay here.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.662
Once the plane is good as new,

19:55.695 --> 19:57.530
Mommy and Daddy will be right
back, okay?

19:57.564 --> 19:58.765
Okay. Dad.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.733
I miss home.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.006
I know.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.975
I do, too.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.310
So, we get to go back soon?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.682
We'll talk about
it when I get back.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.350
Okay?

20:17.384 --> 20:18.651
Okay.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.291
This is all we do. JAMIE: What?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.659
Danger.
Whenever we're on this plane,

20:26.693 --> 20:29.028
all we do is go from
danger to more danger.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.365
Finally saved Isaac,
and I put him right back into it.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.268
Come on. You're just
doing the best you can.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.770
Am I? Is this where I
want him to grow up?

20:37.804 --> 20:39.272
We're all just
trying to make sure

20:39.306 --> 20:40.986
that there's a world
for him to grow up in.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.048
(roars)

20:49.081 --> 20:50.350
(tablet beeps)

20:50.383 --> 20:52.352
What was that?

20:52.385 --> 20:54.954
(lock clicks, hisses)

20:54.987 --> 20:57.357
(grunts): It's locked.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.392
(tablet beeping) JAMIE:
More malfunctions.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.693
(grunts)

21:02.662 --> 21:04.597
Hey! Hey, grab onto something!

21:05.798 --> 21:07.934
What? Grab onto something!

21:07.967 --> 21:09.869
(alarm blaring, wind rushing)

21:14.674 --> 21:15.908
You can reach it!

21:18.511 --> 21:20.046
(grunting)

21:26.653 --> 21:27.896
LEE: This doesn't
make any sense.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.089
That was the last
sample from the hikers,

21:30.122 --> 21:32.592
and it doesn't match
any known hybrids.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.761
Which could mean...

21:34.794 --> 21:37.930
we are looking for
a brand-new species.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.966
Yeah, maybe.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.603
But... what if the reason
that they don't match

21:43.636 --> 21:46.573
is because they aren't
actually from a hybrid?

21:46.606 --> 21:48.575
At least, not exactly.

21:48.608 --> 21:49.942
I don't follow.

21:49.976 --> 21:53.946
I had this case a few years ago.

21:53.980 --> 21:57.917
The killer used botulinum
toxin from bacterial spores.

22:00.620 --> 22:04.491
Comparing them to the structure
of these hybrid traces,

22:04.524 --> 22:07.494
I think that our hikers
died from inhaling spores.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.829
Airborne toxic spores.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.632
The big question is still:

22:12.665 --> 22:14.834
Where did these
spores come from?

22:14.867 --> 22:17.670
(snoring)

22:22.074 --> 22:23.810
What are you doing, Jackson?

22:25.945 --> 22:28.481
You really think it
would be so easy?

22:28.515 --> 22:30.082
No. Did you?

22:31.551 --> 22:32.551
(choking)

22:35.187 --> 22:36.789
(grunts)

22:36.823 --> 22:39.426
(panting)

22:39.459 --> 22:41.961
Glad to see you still have
some fight left in you.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.134
Brain frequency?

22:54.106 --> 22:55.908
You want me to wake the tiger.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.780
You're trying to
measure the frequency.

23:00.813 --> 23:05.552
My ability to control the
hybrids is similar to yours.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.488
It flows from the emotion
centers of the brain.

23:08.521 --> 23:12.158
The stronger the emotion,
the stronger the signal.

23:12.191 --> 23:15.628
But your fear alone
wasn't enough.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.830
I need more.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.766
I need your rage.

23:19.799 --> 23:23.135
I'll give you nothing.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.171
You can try to
resist all you want.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.106
But by the time
we're through here,

23:27.139 --> 23:29.476
you'll have woken that tiger.

23:29.509 --> 23:33.012
You'll have given me
everything I need.

23:33.045 --> 23:35.648
(computer beeping)

23:35.682 --> 23:37.083
Uh-oh.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.486
That can't be good.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.621
An open door?

23:41.654 --> 23:43.590
At that altitude?

23:49.729 --> 23:51.097
(grunting)

23:51.130 --> 23:52.965
(grunting)

23:56.035 --> 23:58.538
It's not working!

23:58.571 --> 24:01.741
Mitch! Mitch!

24:01.774 --> 24:03.910
Right down the hatch.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.745
Here's some water.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.083
That's it.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.752
Abe, get down here!

24:12.785 --> 24:14.120
(over radio): Abe!

24:19.125 --> 24:21.060
Dariela!

24:22.729 --> 24:24.497
(grunts)

24:24.531 --> 24:27.066
Starting to see some
color blobs coming back.

24:27.099 --> 24:30.670
Ah. Max Morgan...
Explorer, genius, lover.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.506
Take it easy. You just gave
me some geriatric medicine.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.008
Hey, look, son,
I know you're feeling guilty

24:36.042 --> 24:37.085
about what you did to Jamie.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.144
Am I?

24:38.177 --> 24:39.846
Yeah. I get it. It's okay.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.814
I mean, how many webs
do you think I weaved

24:41.848 --> 24:43.783
over my numerous
romantic dalliances, huh?

24:43.816 --> 24:45.818
I'd rather not know
the answer to that.

24:45.852 --> 24:49.155
Look, the-the point is...

24:49.188 --> 24:51.791
it always catches up to you.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.794
No matter how hard it might be,

24:54.827 --> 24:56.095
just tell Jamie the truth.

24:58.565 --> 25:02.635
You have to bypass
the control panel!

25:02.669 --> 25:03.670
Okay.

25:03.703 --> 25:04.971
I'm in.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.873
Cut the blue wire!

25:06.906 --> 25:08.507
And then the green wire!

25:11.077 --> 25:13.613
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
know, it'll be terrible.

25:13.646 --> 25:16.248
But after a while,
it'll still be terrible.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.050
But a little less.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.855
That's beautiful.
Can I cross-stitch that on a pillow?

25:22.889 --> 25:24.891
I'm serious.
Come on, you can't be worried about

25:24.924 --> 25:26.926
what you've done,
only what you're gonna do.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.562
But no matter what you choose...

25:29.596 --> 25:31.598
And I'm gonna drop
the "L" word here...

25:31.631 --> 25:33.733
Oh, that's really not necessary.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.578
I know I haven't said it in along
time, and I need to.

25:35.602 --> 25:36.903
(sighs)

25:36.936 --> 25:38.938
Because no matter what you
choose, son,

25:38.971 --> 25:41.107
I will always...

25:41.140 --> 25:42.341
Oh, wow! Look at that.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.943
Full vision, just came back.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.245
A-plus, bang-up job, Max.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.780
Yeah.

25:47.814 --> 25:49.949
(grunts) Okay.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.283
Put them together!

25:52.919 --> 25:54.286
This isn't working.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.024
Was it the dark green
or the light green?

25:58.057 --> 25:59.892
Why are there two greens?

25:59.926 --> 26:01.327
(plane rumbling, P.A. beeps)

26:01.360 --> 26:03.630
A.I. LOGAN: Aircraft Emergency A.I.
activated.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.765
Greetings, Mitchell Morgan.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.737
Is that Logan?

26:10.770 --> 26:13.740
Please don't tell me Logan
is the voice of the A.I.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.675
That's terrific.
A.I. LOGAN: Alert.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.678
There's a critical malfunction
in the vehicle bay.

26:18.711 --> 26:19.846
Hey, Jamie?

26:19.879 --> 26:22.048
Logan, your narrator, is here,

26:22.081 --> 26:24.292
and he's telling us something's
going on in the vehicle bay?

26:24.316 --> 26:25.284
(static crackling)

26:25.317 --> 26:27.319
Jamie?

26:27.353 --> 26:29.121
Ja...

26:29.155 --> 26:31.023
That's broken.

26:31.057 --> 26:34.393
Well, summoning rod's EMP
has a three-foot radius.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.629
Must have fried out
our earpieces earlier.

26:36.663 --> 26:39.799
You know, summoning rods
will tend to do that.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.701
(Mitch groans)

26:41.734 --> 26:42.769
Abe!

26:45.237 --> 26:47.139
(mechanical whirring, clanking)

26:51.878 --> 26:53.680
(lock beeps, chimes)

26:55.414 --> 26:57.016
Are you all right?

26:57.049 --> 26:59.218
(panting): Great.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.120
What's with the
disembodied Logan voice?

27:01.153 --> 27:02.221
It's weirding me out.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.023
You said there was
a problem here?

27:04.056 --> 27:05.658
Where were you? We needed you.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.202
I couldn't hear you because
my earpiece was broken,

27:07.226 --> 27:09.962
and we were having some...
father, son issues.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.273
MAX: Breakthrough.
MITCH: Anyway.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.965
Logan. Explain.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.901
It's the emergency A.I. system.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.336
Back when we were together,
we thought it would be funny

27:17.369 --> 27:19.447
to have him be the voice of it.
I disabled it ages ago,

27:19.471 --> 27:22.875
but it must've come back on
with all the malfunctions.

27:22.909 --> 27:25.111
A.I. LOGAN: Hello.
I have an unfortunate announcement.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.312
(plane rumbling)

27:26.345 --> 27:29.048
Aircraft systems down
to only essentials.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.683
Engines and avionics only.

27:30.717 --> 27:33.152
Engines and avionics?

27:33.185 --> 27:35.585
Clem's tank. We have to get down there.
She could lose power.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.105
JAMIE: Mitch, wait.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.041
I'm going down there right
now, I'm taking Clem

27:55.074 --> 27:56.318
out of that tank.
No, you must not.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.452
She still needs a blood
transfusion from the baby's father.

27:57.476 --> 28:00.246
If you take her out of the tank
now, the baby may die.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.881
If we do nothing, they both die.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.415
Look, we all love Clem,

28:03.449 --> 28:05.985
but that baby is the key
to humanity's future.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.329
We're talking about
my daughter here, Abe.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.788
My son is on this plane, too.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.489
But this is bigger
than all of us!

28:10.522 --> 28:13.025
Calm down. We just need
to figure out what to do.

28:13.059 --> 28:16.162
A.I. LOGAN: May I suggest using
one of the auxiliary generators?

28:16.195 --> 28:18.898
Are we gonna start taking
suggestions from DJ Logan now?

28:18.931 --> 28:21.067
Hang on.
What auxiliary generator?

28:21.100 --> 28:23.035
If we create an
independent power loop,

28:23.069 --> 28:24.871
this could actually work.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.506
The tank will lose
power in five minutes.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.475
This might be our only option.

28:29.508 --> 28:32.211
(ears ringing)

28:32.244 --> 28:33.244
Mitch? You all right?

28:36.082 --> 28:38.484
Your friends are
surprisingly resourceful.

28:38.517 --> 28:41.487
They'll find a way to stop you.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.089
So will I.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.490
You're surprisingly confident

28:44.523 --> 28:47.393
for a man whose only
course of action

28:47.426 --> 28:49.361
is to give me
exactly what I want.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.803
Abe, Dariela.

28:56.836 --> 28:59.071
Cut the cable directly
in front of you.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.273
At the exact same
moment, Mitch, Max,

29:01.307 --> 29:03.242
connect your cables together.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.245
A.I. LOGAN: 30 seconds
until the tank loses power.

29:06.278 --> 29:07.880
Can we shut him off, please?

29:07.914 --> 29:09.248
Everybody ready? Yeah. Yeah.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.917
Okay, on three.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.018
One,

29:12.051 --> 29:13.452
two, three.

29:13.485 --> 29:14.954
(electricity crackling)

29:16.856 --> 29:18.324
Power successfully rerouted.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.827
Critical power loss imminent.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.795
Avionics failure imminent.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.196
Engine failure imminent.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.332
Critical altitude loss imminent.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.467
We need to kill that hybrid now.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.803
Jamie,
let me modify the beacon signal,

29:30.837 --> 29:33.840
draw the hybrid off the battery
so you can reboot the system.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.875
I know the risks,
but we're out of time.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.509
Full engine failure
in ten minutes.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.345
Okay, you have five.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.948
Once the hybrid is off the
battery, I'll reboot the system.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.515
Mitch, Max, go to the bar

29:43.549 --> 29:45.918
and be ready to throw that
switch when I tell you.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.888
You had me at "go to the bar."

29:48.921 --> 29:51.066
Warning: there's a malfunction
in the forward reserve tank.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.826
Detecting a fuel leak. Perfect.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.061
We can't use firearms now.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.163
Then how are we
supposed to kill it?

29:57.196 --> 29:58.264
We are killing it.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.271
Happy birthday, Dariela.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.476
Once the system
reboot is complete,

30:10.509 --> 30:13.812
I'll give you the signal,
and you can throw the master switch.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.585
Is that the Duncan image?

30:19.618 --> 30:21.921
Yeah, I'm trying a new filter
since the last one failed.

30:21.954 --> 30:25.858
But don't worry,
we're gonna find him.

30:25.892 --> 30:28.227
Look, I...

30:28.260 --> 30:30.897
I know that there's
something going on with you.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.440
I don't know if you're
upset or you're worried

30:32.464 --> 30:34.600
about Clementine or what,
but it's going to be okay.

30:34.633 --> 30:37.069
Please don't worry.
Everything is gonna be fine.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.109
I got to talk to
you about something.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.411
Guys, uh, don't mean to
interrupt the love fest, but...

30:45.444 --> 30:48.447
A.I. LOGAN: Full engine
failure in seven minutes.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.949
Okay, get to the master switch.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.450
Wait, here, take the earpiece.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.170
Ready?

31:11.203 --> 31:12.371
Ready.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.315
Okay, Jamie. We're in position.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.017
Abe, Dariela, stand by.

31:25.051 --> 31:26.352
Ready.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.288
Once I press this,

31:29.321 --> 31:32.591
that hybrid will be
coming straight for us.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.126
I'm good.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.628
Jamie, we'll let you know as
soon as the hybrid's loose.

31:41.700 --> 31:45.237
ABIGAIL: Fuel leak,
loss of altitude.

31:45.271 --> 31:48.975
You could give in to your
despair, your hatred.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.709
Use them.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.644
Wake the tiger.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.714
Have him tear out my throat.
I have nothing to stop you.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.551
You could finish
me, be the hero.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.021
Defeat your villain.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.156
If anything happens to
them, I swear...

32:04.190 --> 32:05.557
You swear what?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.960
Come on, Jackson.
What are you gonna do?

32:07.994 --> 32:09.095
Your friends are gonna die.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.662
You don't know my friends!

32:10.696 --> 32:13.399
No, Jackson,
I know your friends all too well.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.067
One of them in particular.

32:16.702 --> 32:19.972
And he's not gonna stop me.

32:20.006 --> 32:22.574
He's gonna help me.
What'd you do?

32:22.608 --> 32:26.378
Your friend Mitch Morgan has
my bio-drive in his head.

32:26.412 --> 32:30.116
I've used it to make him do all
sorts of things over the years.

32:30.149 --> 32:32.618
He helped me build the
beacons, develop the hybrids.

32:35.387 --> 32:39.025
You could almost say...
he's been my partner.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.459
You're lying.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.628
I even created a new
personality for him.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.597
One that can be
activated or deactivated

32:45.631 --> 32:48.167
with the flick of a switch...

32:48.200 --> 32:50.369
Mr. Duncan.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.640
Mitch...

32:54.673 --> 32:56.775
is Mr. Duncan?

32:56.808 --> 33:00.546
You ready to meet him?

33:00.579 --> 33:01.579
(computer beeps)

33:03.682 --> 33:06.185
(ears ringing)

33:06.218 --> 33:09.188
(grunting)

33:09.221 --> 33:11.323
MAX: Mitch! Mitch!

33:15.094 --> 33:16.628
What is it? The bio-drive.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.464
I think it's back on.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.500
All right, I got you.
I'm right here for you.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.102
You got to fight through this.
I can't.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.803
I can't fight through it, Dad.
You got...

33:24.836 --> 33:27.173
Take this thing out of my head!

33:30.109 --> 33:32.044
(phone ringing, vibrating)

33:38.350 --> 33:40.319
Hello?

33:40.352 --> 33:42.354
ABIGAIL (over phone):
Hello, old friend.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.690
It's good to finally
hear your voice.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.593
MITCH: Abigail?

33:47.626 --> 33:48.427
Can you help me?

33:48.460 --> 33:50.162
Mitch, Mitch,
listen to me, okay?

33:50.196 --> 33:51.597
Do not listen to her.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.365
Do not listen to a word
she tells you, okay?

33:53.399 --> 33:55.601
It's no use, Jackson.
Mitch Morgan is gone.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.404
MITCH: I'm on a plane,
and all the people here,

33:58.437 --> 34:01.173
they're calling me "Mitch."

34:01.207 --> 34:03.575
No, you are Charles Duncan.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.487
The people there,
whatever they are telling you,

34:05.511 --> 34:07.279
it is a lie.

34:07.313 --> 34:10.449
All of our plans for the hybrids
are finally coming to pass.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.784
Mitch, focus on my voice, okay?
This is Jackson.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.353
Can you hear me?

34:14.386 --> 34:15.487
The people there,

34:15.521 --> 34:16.822
they are trying to stop us.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.489
You cannot let that happen.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.492
You must make sure
that plane goes down.

34:20.525 --> 34:21.493
Mitch, no!

34:21.527 --> 34:22.694
Okay, listen to me!

34:22.728 --> 34:24.263
Can you hear me?

34:24.295 --> 34:25.806
And then all of our
work will be complete.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.099
Do you understand?

34:27.132 --> 34:29.101
I understand.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.103
JACKSON: Mitch, no, no, no.
Listen-listen to me!

34:31.137 --> 34:32.580
Focus on my voice!
Listen to what I'm tell...

34:32.603 --> 34:33.605
(tablet chimes)

34:35.873 --> 34:37.342
What the hell did you do to him?

34:37.376 --> 34:38.543
I made him mine.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.346
I'm gonna kill you!

34:43.149 --> 34:44.891
A.I. LOGAN: Main battery
unit is back online.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.885
Okay, Abe, Dariela,
the hybrid is off the battery.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.254
I'm starting the reboot.

34:51.322 --> 34:53.259
Copy.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.826
But there's still no sign of it.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.467
Abe! (roaring)

35:01.500 --> 35:03.735
Okay, Mitch, I'm good here.
Restart the plane.

35:03.769 --> 35:04.903
(plane rumbling)

35:04.936 --> 35:07.506
Mitch?

35:07.539 --> 35:09.508
Mitch, do you copy?
Restart the plane.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.543
Mitch?

35:11.577 --> 35:13.788
A.I. LOGAN: The master switch
is still in the off position.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.714
What the hell?

35:15.747 --> 35:18.184
Manual restart required.

35:18.217 --> 35:21.487
This is a story you're
all too familiar with,

35:21.520 --> 35:23.155
isn't it, Jackson?

35:23.189 --> 35:26.658
You failing to save
the ones you love.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.295
What are you talking about?

35:29.328 --> 35:31.297
It was a summer's day.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.700
That clean feeling in the air.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.336
The kind you get
after a rainfall.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.505
A young family pulls
into a filling station

35:39.538 --> 35:41.807
just outside of Nairobi.

35:41.840 --> 35:46.512
Mother, father and son,

35:46.545 --> 35:48.814
wrapped in that
beautiful yellow blanket.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.516
Shut up.

35:50.549 --> 35:53.419
So lovingly knit for
him by his mother.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.221
Stop.

35:55.254 --> 35:58.590
And in that moment,
everything was perfect.

35:58.624 --> 36:01.827
Tragedy makes its own plans.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.230
I said stop!

36:04.263 --> 36:08.600
And as that father
watched his truck

36:08.634 --> 36:11.270
engulfed in flames,

36:11.303 --> 36:17.243
his wife and child trapped
and burning inside,

36:17.276 --> 36:20.346
he was utterly helpless.

36:20.379 --> 36:27.219
You were utterly helpless
the day you failed Connor.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.255
How do you know about my son?

36:29.288 --> 36:30.956
(plane rumbling)

36:40.899 --> 36:41.933
Oh, my God.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.835
What happened?

36:43.869 --> 36:45.771
Mitch!

36:46.938 --> 36:48.974
Mitch!

36:49.007 --> 36:51.677
Stop calling me that.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.280
Mitch,
we need to reboot the plane now.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.920
My name is Duncan.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.327
Oh, my God.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.397
Last night... that was you.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.031
Mitch,

37:13.064 --> 37:15.901
Duncan, whatever your name
is, move.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.303
I need to throw that switch.

37:17.336 --> 37:18.937
A.I. LOGAN: Losing altitude.

37:18.970 --> 37:22.641
Prepare for
emergency procedures.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.310
I said move.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.545
No.

37:38.056 --> 37:41.059
After we determined that the hybrid
spores were the cause of death,

37:41.092 --> 37:44.062
we scanned the area surrounding
where the hikers have died.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.398
But we didn't find
anything of note.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.567
Till we analyzed the wind
patterns in the Black Forest

37:48.600 --> 37:50.569
around their time of death.

37:50.602 --> 37:54.039
From there, we traced the
spores to their point of origin.

37:54.072 --> 37:58.076
Here. About seven miles
southwest of our victims.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.021
The spores rode the wind,
like the seeds of a dandelion.

38:00.045 --> 38:01.780
Exactly.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.382
And that's when we found this.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.984
GARRISON: What exactly
am I looking at here?

38:06.017 --> 38:08.820
Our dandelions.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.332
We believe that this
is a hybrid nest.

38:10.356 --> 38:12.591
GARRISON: A nest of hybrids?
That's right.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.660
And those eggs are the
source of the spores.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.061
Most likely emitted
as some kind of

38:16.094 --> 38:17.104
a natural self-defense
mechanism.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.697
Son of a bitch.

38:18.730 --> 38:19.965
And that's the good news.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.933
We cross-referenced our data

38:21.967 --> 38:23.602
with local law
enforcement worldwide,

38:23.635 --> 38:25.371
and we found similar victims.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.872
And two more nests.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.475
LEE: One in Seoul and
the other in Atlanta.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.643
Atlanta? If those eggs hatch,

38:31.677 --> 38:33.745
this facility, the barrier...

38:33.779 --> 38:34.846
None of it's gonna matter.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.749
Who knows how many more
nests could be out there?

38:37.783 --> 38:39.951
Send a team to the Black Forest

38:39.985 --> 38:42.654
and burn that nest
to the ground.

38:42.688 --> 38:46.825
You have one duty as a parent

38:46.858 --> 38:49.595
that stands above the rest:

38:49.628 --> 38:52.664
to protect your child.

38:52.698 --> 38:53.999
Stop it.

38:54.032 --> 38:56.368
And you failed. Shut up.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.036
It was you.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.539
It was your fault.

39:00.572 --> 39:03.975
Your entire family is dead.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.878
How are you gonna save your
friends, Jackson?

39:06.912 --> 39:09.448
You couldn't even
save your own baby...

39:09.481 --> 39:10.882
That's enough!

39:10.916 --> 39:12.651
(growling)

39:15.821 --> 39:16.755
(grunts)

39:16.788 --> 39:18.123
(roaring)

39:20.892 --> 39:22.394
(grunts)

39:22.428 --> 39:23.495
Dariela!

39:30.502 --> 39:32.046
If I don't throw that
switch, we are all gonna die.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.070
That's the idea.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.781
(wind rushing)

39:42.814 --> 39:43.915
Mitch, let go!

39:46.452 --> 39:49.988
You failed as a father.
Shut up. Shut up.

39:50.021 --> 39:52.057
Shut up. You let Connor die.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.759
Shut up!

39:53.792 --> 39:55.961
You think our
father was a madman?

39:55.994 --> 39:57.829
A monster?

39:57.863 --> 40:01.032
He laid down his life for you.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.735
His son.

40:03.769 --> 40:06.004
(growling)

40:08.006 --> 40:09.006
Got it!

40:14.012 --> 40:15.714
Behind you!

40:21.520 --> 40:23.088
Abe!

40:24.155 --> 40:25.624
(yells)

40:25.657 --> 40:27.626
(roaring)

40:27.659 --> 40:30.629
A.I. LOGAN: Aircraft will cross
the minimum recovery altitude

40:30.662 --> 40:32.564
in 90 seconds. Isaac.

40:32.598 --> 40:35.734
Prepare for emergency landing.

40:35.767 --> 40:40.539
Connor burned to death,
and you watched it happen!

40:40.572 --> 40:42.508
Shut up! Shut up!

40:42.541 --> 40:44.710
ABIGAIL: Your son is dead

40:44.743 --> 40:46.244
because of you.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.846
(yells)

40:47.879 --> 40:48.879
(roars)

40:55.286 --> 40:57.222
(tablet beeping)

40:59.658 --> 41:02.661
Why, thank you, Jackson.

41:02.694 --> 41:06.565
When you commanded
that tiger to attack,

41:06.598 --> 41:10.702
you handed me your secret,
the way you control the animals.

41:10.736 --> 41:13.171
And with it,

41:13.204 --> 41:15.607
the last piece I need
to activate the beacons

41:15.641 --> 41:17.976
and the hybrids rise.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.511
Abigail.

41:19.545 --> 41:21.513
What does that mean?

41:21.547 --> 41:23.114
What do you mean, beacons?

41:23.148 --> 41:25.250
Abigail!

41:25.283 --> 41:27.152
Answer me!

41:31.990 --> 41:34.793
Damn it, Mitch, let me go!

41:34.826 --> 41:37.763
Mitch isn't here anymore.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.832
A.I. LOGAN: Minimum recovery
altitude in 60 seconds.

41:56.648 --> 41:58.216
50 seconds.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.859
Mitch, I don't want to do this!

42:10.729 --> 42:12.569
Damn it, Mitch,
you're gonna get us all killed!

42:14.099 --> 42:15.834
A.I. LOGAN: 40 seconds.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.119
