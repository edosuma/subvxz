WEBVTT

00:19.436 --> 00:22.480
<i>LINDA: Okay, uh, just get here</i>
<i>as soon as you can, okay, Gayle?</i>

00:22.564 --> 00:23.815
<i>Oh, and by the way,</i>

00:23.898 --> 00:25.108
Gene has the stomach flu

00:25.191 --> 00:27.027
and he's barfing and has crazy diarrhea,

00:27.110 --> 00:29.279
so he's spending Thanksgiving
in the apartment bathroom

00:29.362 --> 00:31.072
and we all have to use
the bathroom in the restaurant.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.450
What do you mean, "which Gene?"
Our son Gene.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.326
The guy who you met at the bank that time?

00:35.410 --> 00:37.454
Why would Gene from the bank
come to our dinner?

00:37.537 --> 00:39.372
(laughs): Get out of here.
All right, I'll see you soon.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.958
Well, news flash,
I'm already tired of Gayle.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.002
Yeah, me, too.
But she'd better hurry,

00:44.085 --> 00:47.130
because my roasted pear
and Brie en croute appetizer

00:47.213 --> 00:49.049
is gonna be done in 20 minutes.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.508
Yeah. Uh-huh. Great. Yeah.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.926
You guys are, uh, excited about

00:52.010 --> 00:53.595
all the new, innovative menu stuff

00:53.678 --> 00:55.680
-I'm doing this year, right?
-About what?

00:55.764 --> 00:57.891
My new, innovative Thanksgiving menu.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.893
Baked Brie and roasted pears appetizer,

00:59.976 --> 01:02.312
rosemary bread,
sausage and chestnut stuffing, and...

01:02.395 --> 01:04.939
You know, I've been blogging
about it all morning, Dad,

01:05.023 --> 01:06.858
-Yeah?
-and, ooh, what's this-- an e-mail?

01:06.941 --> 01:08.693
-Yeah?
-I just got a book deal.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.653
Y-You got a book deal, from your blog?

01:10.737 --> 01:13.239
I got a book deal.
They want to print the blog.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.325
I know that's
an imaginary computer, but...

01:15.408 --> 01:16.951
can I see the e-mail?

01:17.035 --> 01:18.995
Oh, sorry. It's confidential.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.538
I really wish Gene wasn't sick.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.374
He was so excited about all this new food.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.835
Aw, poor Gene,
getting stomach flu on Thanksgiving.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.004
Yeah, you're supposed to have
a buffet, not a barf-et.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.923
Well, hopefully
he's feeling a little better.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.841
I'm gonna go give him the sip test
and find out.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.593
-Wish me luck.
-Ooh, sip test.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.095
Now <i>this </i>is exciting.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.930
Sippee-ki-yay, mother-barfer.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.807
Well, I'm excited about you.

01:38.890 --> 01:42.102
(high-pitched):
And we're excited about you, old man.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.104
(regular voice):
Wait, why'd you call me old?

01:44.187 --> 01:47.816
(high-pitched): Sorry, it's just,
uh, it was a fun nickname.

01:47.899 --> 01:51.236
Hi.
How's my little barfy baby boy?

01:51.319 --> 01:52.237
Oh. I'm great.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.072
Ooh, I love the eye shadow.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.240
Yeah, I was bored and I found

01:55.323 --> 01:56.866
some old makeup in the medicine cabinet.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.077
I also found some old medicine,
but I'm gonna sell it.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.245
That's a great plan.

02:00.328 --> 02:01.746
Also, I wrote a song.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.931
BOB (distant):
That was beautiful, Gene!

02:20.015 --> 02:22.434
-Thank you, Father.
-Okay, it's time for the test.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.185
You know the drill.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.229
If you can keep some crackers
and ginger ale down

02:26.312 --> 02:28.481
for 30 minutes without barfing
or juicy-pooping,

02:28.565 --> 02:31.026
you can come out
for Thanksgiving dinner, okay?

02:31.109 --> 02:33.236
If not, you got to stay in here, honey.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.988
This apartment's too small for anyone

02:35.071 --> 02:36.614
with the stomach flu to be mingling.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.033
It's our system and it works.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.994
I bet he barfs in ten minutes.
Should we do a pool?

02:41.077 --> 02:43.621
GENE: I am not gonna barf again.
I'm feeling great.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.331
I'm eating. Mmm, mmm.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.250
I'm drinking...
(slurps)

02:47.334 --> 02:49.169
And see? I'm fine.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.255
It's coming out both ways again!

02:52.339 --> 02:55.008
Oh, God, I got to sit down...
No, I got to stand up.

02:55.091 --> 02:57.510
-(retches)
-I'm so sorry, Gene,

02:57.594 --> 02:59.971
but no Thanksgiving dinner
for you today, baby.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.891
GENE:
That wasn't me.
That was a pigeon that flew in here.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.768
He seems very sick.
I can come to dinner.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.520
I'm...
(retching)

03:07.604 --> 03:08.855
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>

03:08.938 --> 03:10.690
Brie and roasted pears.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.485
Oh, I can't eat this.
I'm lactose intolerant, Bob.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.445
You know a psychic told me that.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.031
Yeah, Dad, you know a psychic said that!

03:18.114 --> 03:21.076
Uh, I guess you could just pick
the pears out and eat those.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.120
The recipe called for apples,
but I used pears.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.247
-TINA: So bold.
-(Gene moaning)

03:26.331 --> 03:29.709
Oh, my God. My ghost Devin
must have followed me here.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.462
-He's obsessed with me.
-That's not a ghost, Gayle.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.382
-It's Gene.
-Girls, go check on him.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.009
You doing okay in there?
How's the barf biz?

03:38.093 --> 03:39.636
GENE:
I think I pooped out the part

03:39.719 --> 03:41.179
of my brain that knew
everything that was happening

03:41.262 --> 03:44.015
-on <i>The Kominsky Method.</i>
-Whoa. That's most of his brain.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.976
Wait.
Do I smell warm cheese?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.020
Do you guys have Dad's hot Brie out there?

03:49.104 --> 03:51.189
-No.
-Ugh! It's bad enough

03:51.272 --> 03:53.441
I have to smell the rosemary bread
baking in the oven.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.652
I can't believe I'm missing
the best food day of the year!

03:55.735 --> 03:56.861
It's not fair!

03:56.945 --> 03:58.321
Is there anything we can do for you?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.864
Do you want us to do a dance?

03:59.948 --> 04:02.409
Uh, I-I mean, we could do it
and then describe it to you?

04:02.492 --> 04:05.203
Tell me a story.
Take my mind off this agony.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.414
-What kind of story?
-A story about anything

04:07.497 --> 04:08.623
other than food.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.251
(gasps)
Wait, no. Make me hate food.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.795
-Okay, okay. You want to hate food?
-Yeah.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.923
(chuckles)
I'll make food wish it'd never been born.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.676
So, it was Thanksgiving Day, 1987.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.761
<i>But inside the chopper</i>
<i>of the elite special forces unit</i>

04:21.845 --> 04:23.847
<i>led by Gene "Dutch Oven" Belcher,</i>

04:23.930 --> 04:25.598
<i>no one was celebrating.</i>

04:25.682 --> 04:28.643
The Melted Butter River.
Beautiful but deadly.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.104
-What?!
-I said "The Melted Butter..."

04:31.187 --> 04:33.565
I can't hear you.
The helicopter's too loud!

04:33.648 --> 04:35.150
-What?!
-Huh?
-What?!

04:35.233 --> 04:38.069
-GENE: Never mind.
-COURTNEY: What?!

04:39.154 --> 04:40.864
Welcome to the jungle.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.741
(chuckles)
Like in the song.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.743
Come on, follow me.
Let's move!

04:44.826 --> 04:46.494
All right, here's the deal.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.204
The cabinet minister
went across the border

04:48.288 --> 04:50.457
on some kind of mission
that I'm not gonna explain right now

04:50.540 --> 04:52.667
'cause it really...
it was just to set the plot in motion.

04:52.751 --> 04:56.087
-Right.
-Anyways, lot of action
in the Wheat Jungle this time of year.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.006
People smuggling wheat
to make fresh rosemary bread

04:58.089 --> 04:59.215
for Thanksgiving dinner.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.967
Thanksgiving dinner?
I never eat it,

05:01.051 --> 05:02.385
because I don't thank the world.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.595
-LOUISE: It thanks you
-It thanks me

05:03.678 --> 05:05.138
-for saving it.
-for saving it.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.891
Well, if it isn't old Dutch Oven.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.435
If you smelt it, you know I dealt it.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.853
Sorry I'm so strong.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.105
Sorry <i>I'm </i>so strong.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.900
But even Dutch Oven wasn't ready
for what was about to happen.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.070
Because waiting for them
out there in the wheat trees...

05:20.153 --> 05:21.446
Wait. Wheat doesn't actually
grow on trees, it grows...

05:21.529 --> 05:22.655
-Oh, my God, Tina.
-Oh, oh, okay.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.282
I was just getting to the exciting part.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.909
GENE:
Uh, plus, I'm pretty sure wheat

05:25.992 --> 05:27.327
-grows on trees.
-Correct, Gene.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.912
Like I said,

05:28.995 --> 05:31.581
<i>waiting for them out there</i>
<i>was the most terrifying creature</i>

05:31.664 --> 05:35.043
<i>that special effects</i>
<i>could make in the year 1987...</i>

05:36.711 --> 05:38.338
<i>...the Bread-ator.</i>

05:41.549 --> 05:44.636
So, Bread-ator.
It's like Predator, but made of bread?

05:44.719 --> 05:46.846
Yes, exactly.
And Gene is going to hate bread

05:46.930 --> 05:48.223
by the time the story is over.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.893
COURTNEY:
That helicopter is all messed up.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.603
GENE:
And the whole crew is gone.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.605
Yeah, maybe they
went to go look for snacks.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.316
Or they became snacks.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.485
GENE:
(gasps) Mother of Mindy.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.821
That's the cabinet minister
and his security detail.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.906
-Are they dead?
-No. They're breathing.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.367
But it looks like they've been
turned into human carbs.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.202
LINDA:
Hey! What are you doing on my turf?

06:09.285 --> 06:11.621
There must have been a mi-mi-mi-mix-up.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.415
-Gayle, take their weapons.
-Okay.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.333
-Who are these guys?
-Just some local smugglers.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.584
Let me do the talking.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.753
Look, Linda, we're not here for you.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.339
Got a couple of our guys turned
into freaky-flaky pastries

06:21.423 --> 06:22.632
by some kind of psycho.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.259
So just let us go so we can find

06:24.342 --> 06:26.177
-whoever did this.
-Wowzers.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.221
Those are some creepy croissants.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.850
GENE:
They got twisted up.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.768
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>The Bread-ator started firing huge globs</i>

06:33.852 --> 06:35.770
of unbaked dough at the squadron,

06:35.854 --> 06:37.689
but it could make itself invisible
so they couldn't see

06:37.772 --> 06:39.983
<i>-the monster as it attacked.</i>
-Take cover!

06:41.484 --> 06:44.154
I'll load the Bun Blaster!

06:44.237 --> 06:47.449
-Who's firing at us?
-Not "who." "What." Look.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.368
-(groaning)
-LINDA: Oh, I got 'em!

06:50.452 --> 06:51.453
LOUISE:
Get down!

06:51.536 --> 06:54.289
-(weapon fires)
-No!

06:54.372 --> 06:56.458
-Better bread than dead.
-Hey, this one can talk.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.877
Wounding that thing must have
made it less powerful.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.086
LINDA:
Oh, my face!

07:00.170 --> 07:01.421
Oh, no.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.422
BREAD-ATOR:
Ow!

07:02.505 --> 07:03.798
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.759
-We got to go after it.
-No, no.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.470
We've got too many people turned
into bread products already.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.138
I need you to go back to the camp on foot

07:10.221 --> 07:12.223
and come back here with
a chopper and some Saran Wrap

07:12.307 --> 07:14.225
so we can keep our friends
from going stale.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.643
What about the monster?

07:15.727 --> 07:17.896
That doughboy
is about to step into the oven.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.606
The Dutch Oven.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.026
-Oh, what a cool thing to say.
-I know. Now go.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.778
Ooh. I look good.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.404
I'm just gonna eat one of me.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.282
-Hey. Get back here.
-Don't eat me. I'm you, stupid.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.869
<i>along the edge of the Melted Butter River.</i>

07:32.952 --> 07:34.496
<i>And then it attacks him and they do</i>

<i>the classic action movie</i>
<i>roll-around fight.</i>

07:37.290 --> 07:39.834

<i>and tumbles over the butterfall.</i>

-Ugh.
<i>-LOUISE: And when Dutch Oven</i>

07:47.384 --> 07:49.803
<i>crawled up on shore coated in butter,</i>

07:49.886 --> 07:52.389
<i>he made a surprising discovery.</i>

08:00.605 --> 08:02.857
It can't see me when I'm coated in butter.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.442
How convenient.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.320
I can't believe it <i>is </i>butter.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.200
Time to carbo-load.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.301
Your bread is buttered.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.594
Aah!

08:33.138 --> 08:36.808
Goodbye, gluten mutant.
You're toast.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.560
-What a cool thing to say.
-Thank you.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.104
Let's go pick up our bakery order.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.439
I... don't get it.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.607
Go pick up our friends
who turned into bread.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.318
Got it, got it.
That is also a very cool thing to say.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.487
-LOUISE: Oh, I know.
-GENE: I'm really sorry I ruined it.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.489
LOUISE:
You did, but it's fine.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.324
And that was the end.
Until the sequel.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.576
So do you hate bread now?

08:54.659 --> 08:55.827
Mm, maybe a little,

08:55.910 --> 08:57.328
but I still love every other food.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.205
-And probably still bread.
-BOB: Guys, I need you

08:59.289 --> 09:01.458
-to set the table.
-Oh, unfortunately,

09:01.541 --> 09:04.419
my story didn't make Gene
completely hate food.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.630
Now Tina needs to tell him
a story where food is the enemy.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.924
And also, I need to be here
in case her glasses fall off.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.177
-(shouts) Oh, no. I can't see.
-I got them.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.430
Uh, okay.
Wait, why is food the enemy?

09:15.513 --> 09:17.891
GENE:
Because if I can't love it,
I have to hate it, Father.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.352
So, I guess I'll set the table, then?

09:20.435 --> 09:23.063
-Seems like the best plan.
-Just have fun with it.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.731
GENE:
So Tina, what's your story about?

09:24.814 --> 09:25.940
TINA:
Oh, um...

09:26.024 --> 09:29.235
My story is about pears.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.780
You think pears are just a fruit
that Gene might like to eat.

09:31.863 --> 09:35.700
But he wouldn't, because pears
can be very, very dangerous.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.662
<i>The year was 1997,</i>
<i>and President Gene Harrison-Ford Belcher</i>

09:39.746 --> 09:42.540
<i>was giving an important speech</i>
<i>in a foreign land.</i>

09:42.624 --> 09:44.042
<i>Apple-achia.</i>

09:44.125 --> 09:47.045

to their beautiful country
and allowing me to eat

your many varieties.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.347
-Pause for laughter.
-(laughter)

09:57.430 --> 09:59.140
He's gonna eat us and I like it.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.893
Wait, they want to be eaten?

10:01.976 --> 10:03.186
-Yeah. They want to be eaten.
-Okay.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.729
No further questions, then.

Gene President Harrison-Ford Belcher out.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.027

<i>But there was one table in the room</i>
who wasn't very happy.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.947
<i>The delegation from Pear-is.</i>

10:14.030 --> 10:15.657
<i>Later,</i>
<i>President Gene Harrison-Ford Belcher</i>

<i>was on his way back to Air Force One.</i>

10:17.534 --> 10:19.369
Sir, just wanted to remind you
that the delegation

10:19.452 --> 10:22.080
from Pear-is will be aboard your plane,

10:22.163 --> 10:23.748
and they'd like to try to convince you

10:23.832 --> 10:25.750
that pears are
just as delicious as apples.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.252
Okay, but mostly I just want to catch up

10:27.335 --> 10:29.337
on <i>The Kominsky Method </i>and see my wife.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.798
Of course, sir.
We have all the episodes streaming on VHS

10:31.881 --> 10:33.883
because it's 1997.

Hi. Welcome to Air Force One

10:35.427 --> 10:36.636
or whatever.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.763
Can we get a tour of the entire plane?

10:38.847 --> 10:40.640
Yeah, we don't want
to do anything weird on it

10:40.724 --> 10:42.934
or anything, we just, uh, want to know

10:43.018 --> 10:45.353
where all the security and stuff is.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.940
Okay.
I'm not suspicious of you at all.

-Bye-bye, Apples.

Right away, sir.

-(women screaming)
-Attention, everybody!

11:25.727 --> 11:27.687
We have taken over this plane

that pears are just as delicious
as apples.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.609
And we're gonna do that
by taking your president hostage!

11:32.692 --> 11:34.027
You'll see, it's a pretty good plan.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.071
-You want to say anything?
-Uh, yeah.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.573
We're changing the call sign of this plane

GENE:
Just keep it PG-Flirteen, huh?

12:02.931 --> 12:04.849
Sir, the pears have hijacked the plane.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.851
We need to get you down to the escape pod.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.145
Uh, hello, what about me, his wife?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.856

Aw, poop.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.028
-You're our hostage now.
-And our best friend?

12:28.957 --> 12:30.667
-Okay.
-All right, thank you for working with me.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.420

12:33.503 --> 12:36.172
Not yet, and we've just received
a message from the pears.

-And there are a lot of people
on that plane

-The end.
-GENE: Thank you, Tina.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.708
Great story and it kind of
made me hate pears,

15:05.363 --> 15:06.990
Um, I'm gonna stay here.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.825
And I could tell you a story.

It's okay, Dad, you can go eat.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.287
I know how much you love Thanksgiving.

15:12.370 --> 15:15.457
No, no, I-I-I actually
really do want to tell you a story.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.959
Um, and, you know, I ate so much food

-Don't rub it in!
-Sorry, sorry.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.718
Is that what I was hearing?

15:26.801 --> 15:28.762
Okay, uh, listen, this is the story

15:28.845 --> 15:31.139
of Gene, uh, Marinara,

15:31.222 --> 15:34.142
owner of one of the most successful, uh...

15:34.225 --> 15:37.520
marinara rigs in the world.
Hey.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.689
-What are you guys doing?
-We want to hear the story.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.524
And we should probably help you tell it,

15:41.608 --> 15:44.444
because you are, you know,
not that great with words or ideas.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.489
Thank you. I thought
I was off to a pretty good start.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.990
We'll be the harsh judges of that.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.950
Anyway, like I said, Gene Marinara

15:51.034 --> 15:54.245
<i>was the best marinara rig operator</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

15:54.329 --> 15:56.956
<i>He had everything--</i>
<i>the best crew, the best gear.</i>

15:57.040 --> 15:58.416
<i>But what he didn't know</i>

15:58.500 --> 16:01.086
<i>was that far away at the, uh, the...</i>

16:01.169 --> 16:02.879
<i>-space place...</i>
<i>-TINA: NASA?</i>

<i>Gayle was about to discover something bad.</i>

16:11.971 --> 16:13.765
Son of a space thing.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.058
<i>What was it?</i>

16:15.141 --> 16:16.351
What did I see?

16:16.434 --> 16:18.144
An asteroid made of chicken parmesan

16:18.228 --> 16:20.689
<i>the size of Texas, headed to destroy</i>

<i>life on Earth as we know it.</i>

Wait, what was it made of?

16:24.275 --> 16:26.194
-BOB: Chicken parmesan, Gene.
-Oh.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.239
That's right,
I'm talking about Parmageddon.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.201
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>Parmageddon.</i>

16:33.284 --> 16:34.786

But...

16:34.869 --> 16:36.329
we've been doing Thanksgiving foods.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.331
Well, this is kind of a Thanksgiving food.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.791
I-It's related.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.836
So at the NASA,
a bunch of people decided...

16:42.919 --> 16:44.587
We need to go up there

16:44.671 --> 16:47.257
and blow up
that big piece of chicken parm!

16:47.340 --> 16:48.675
Scientifically.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.386
We drill inside,
fill it with hot marinara,

16:51.469 --> 16:53.555
-and then...
-Kaboom, daddy!

16:53.638 --> 16:56.349
We just got to find a guy
who's really good at drilling

16:56.433 --> 16:58.518
and probably wears a tank top.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.645
Let her rip!

17:00.729 --> 17:02.564
Whoo-hoo!

17:02.647 --> 17:04.774
-Red gold!
-Boy, he sure can drill.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.401
-And he sure can eat.
-Yep.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.445
That's why they call him the Sauce Boss.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.780
Wait, Dad.
Um, food is supposed to be the enemy.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.407
It is, kind of.
You'll see.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.659
Ooh, suspense, I love it!
Like <i>Knives In!</i>

17:14.743 --> 17:16.661
Um, I think it's <i>Knives Out.</i>

17:16.745 --> 17:19.414
No, it's like, ow, ow,
knives in you, I think.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.416
I don't know.
Movies are too expensive.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.793
-I didn't see it.
-Anyway, Gene finishes

17:23.877 --> 17:25.795
<i>his spaghetti just in time</i>
<i>to see a very official</i>

17:25.879 --> 17:27.339
<i>government Jet Ski pull up to the rig</i>

17:27.422 --> 17:29.632
<i>with a big request to make.</i>

17:29.716 --> 17:33.219
The United States government
just asked us to save the world.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.138
Anyone want to say no?
You know what?

17:35.221 --> 17:37.974
I'll send an Evite,
but please RSVP by tonight.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.352
United States astronauts train for years.

17:40.435 --> 17:43.480
You have 12 minutes.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.482
-Tell me what you see.
-Pierce Brosnan.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.276
-Me robbing a bank?
-Oh, it's Pierce Brosnan.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.904
It's a... a shape.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.156
Lasagna. No, risotto.
No, Pierce Brosnan!

17:53.239 --> 17:54.657
They're ready.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.369
Have fun in space, Sauce Boss!

17:57.452 --> 17:59.996
<i>-MAN: Three, two, one.</i>
<i>-BOB: And so the fearless crew headed</i>

18:00.080 --> 18:02.290
<i>for the gigantic piece</i>
<i>of chicken parmesan.</i>

18:04.918 --> 18:07.295
GENE:
Mamma mia, that's a spicy meatball.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.214
Let's suit up.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.882
All right, we get out there,

18:10.965 --> 18:12.425
we stuff this baby with marinara,

18:12.509 --> 18:14.844
and then we get back in here
and we're home to our wives

18:14.928 --> 18:16.179
by dinner.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.722
<i>Uh, Mom's my wife, right?</i>

18:17.806 --> 18:20.058
-Um, what?
-Mo-Mom was Gene's wife in my story.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.685
Aw, sweet.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.938
We all need to have a talk, as a family.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.815
Don't be a prude, Bob.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.025
(chuckles)
I-I-I don't think it's, uh, prudish.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.902
I... All right, maybe it is.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.862
Uh, you know what, i-it's fine.
Anyway...

18:32.946 --> 18:35.949
the entire crew made it onto the surface
of the chicken parmesan,

18:36.032 --> 18:37.701
but then something went wrong.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.411
This cheesy crust is too thick.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.037
Our drill can't get through it.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.498
-Oh, no. Poor Earth!
-TINA: Shoot.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.291
I live there.
Is there anything we can do?

18:45.375 --> 18:47.293
There's nothing <i>we </i>can do.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.379
But there's something <i>I </i>can do.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.714
Gene, no, y-you don't mean...

18:50.797 --> 18:52.257
I do mean.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.009
I feel like chicken tonight.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.553
All I need is a jet pack and a napkin.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.889
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>The crew returned to Earth,</i>
but Gene stayed out in space and he

18:59.973 --> 19:02.100
<i>ate that space chicken one bite at a time.</i>

19:02.183 --> 19:04.310
<i>He, uh, you know,</i>
<i>he had to take off his helmet,</i>

19:04.394 --> 19:06.187
<i>hold his breath, eat a bite,</i>
<i>then put his helmet back on,</i>

19:06.271 --> 19:07.939
<i>-and... You get it, right?</i>
<i>-LOUISE: Perfect.</i>

19:08.023 --> 19:09.482
Gene, you have to finish!

19:09.566 --> 19:11.985
You're about to enter Earth's atmosphere.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.737
<i>GENE:</i>
<i>So full! Let me just open</i>

19:13.820 --> 19:15.572
<i>the top button of my space suit.</i>

19:15.655 --> 19:17.699
<i>Okay, last bite!</i>
<i>(munching)</i>

19:17.782 --> 19:18.992
-He did it!
-Yeah!

19:19.075 --> 19:20.326
Oh, God, it's coming back up!

19:20.410 --> 19:22.412
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>And then Gene Marinara</i>

19:22.495 --> 19:25.498
<i>diarrheaed and vomited</i>
<i>all that chicken back up,</i>

19:25.582 --> 19:28.752
<i>and it rained hot chicken poop</i>
<i>shooting stars</i>

19:28.835 --> 19:30.253
<i>all around the world,</i>
<i>which was kind of gross,</i>

19:30.337 --> 19:32.339
<i>but also beautiful.</i>

19:32.422 --> 19:34.174
<i>And everyone was fine, and Gene was fine</i>

19:34.257 --> 19:36.259
<i>because he had a jet pack.</i>

19:36.343 --> 19:38.595
<i>The Earth was saved,</i>
<i>and all because Gene had the courage</i>

19:38.678 --> 19:41.014
<i>to eat a chicken parmesan</i>
<i>the size of Texas.</i>

19:41.097 --> 19:42.432
(belches)
Excuse me.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.767
-The end.
-GENE: So,

19:43.850 --> 19:45.560
I guess you figured out that I ate

19:45.643 --> 19:47.187
some of that kind of
rotten chicken parmesan

19:47.270 --> 19:49.314
-that you told me not to eat?
-Yeah.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.565
-I-I saw the bites.
-What?

19:50.648 --> 19:51.608
GENE:
Mom...

19:51.691 --> 19:53.151
I don't have stomach flu.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.903
I-I have food poisoning.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.863
Last night, I was in the kitchen with Dad.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.281
Can I eat some turkey?

19:58.365 --> 19:59.783
No, it's not cooked.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.993
-Bread dough?
-It's rising, don't touch it.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.828
How about this old chicken parmesan?

20:03.912 --> 20:05.497
Gene, no, definitely don't eat that.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.165
That's from, like, two weeks ago.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.459
-Please?
-No! I'm leaving it in there,

20:09.542 --> 20:10.710
Gene, till I take out the trash.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.545
I could eat it and save you the trip.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.755
Gene, go to bed.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.006
<i>GENE:</i>
<i>And I did go to bed.</i>

20:15.090 --> 20:16.716
<i>But later I got up and I ate some</i>

20:16.800 --> 20:19.010
<i>of that old chicken parmesan</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

20:19.094 --> 20:20.679
<i>And I didn't want to tell you</i>

20:20.762 --> 20:23.306
because I was embarrassed
that I basically ate garbage.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.808
I just love to eat!

20:24.891 --> 20:26.810
Gene, it-it's great that you love to eat.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.311
I-I love to feed you.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.313
And you're the only one who was

20:30.397 --> 20:32.315
really interested
in my innovative new menu.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.317
It's just a shame
you didn't get to taste it.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.152
You know, I-I was like
you when I was a kid.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.862
That's how I got interested in cooking.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.989
And as soon as you pass that sip test,

20:40.073 --> 20:41.408
I'll eat dinner with you.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.493
Well, surprise, I've been nibbling

20:43.576 --> 20:45.912
and juicing for the last 30 minutes, baby!

20:45.995 --> 20:47.247
Gene, that's great!

20:47.330 --> 20:48.998
Father, feed me that turkey!

20:49.082 --> 20:51.001
Yay!
Let's all eat at the table.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.795
All right.
Oh, wa... Oh, no!

20:53.878 --> 20:55.922
-Oh, God! Oh, God!
-Oh, no, no, no!

20:56.006 --> 20:57.465
-(splashing)
-It's coming out of everywhere!

20:57.549 --> 20:58.842
Get in the tub!
Get in the tub!
