I'll teach you to compare me to a common elven laborer!

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Aah!

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
How do we keep the Trollblins and Kotassians

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
from destroying each other?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
We can't pick a side.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Well, we better come to a neutral decision in about...

Gather 'round, neighbors. It's story time.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Dude!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
The village of Kotassium was peaceful and sound,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
its real estate made  out of food from the ground.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Now?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
-No, Grup, not now. -Oh.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
The wee people there were all set to relax.

-How about now? -No, Grup, not now.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
-Okay. -I'll tell you when.

Till the mountainous Trollblin came looking for snacks.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Now, Grup, dear.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Hey, that's me.

Oh, I'm already bad at this!

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Now, now, children. Let's continue.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
The Trollblin was hungry for midday lunch fare.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Well, I am kind of peckish... on my mom's side.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
But picked it not realizing people lived there.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Say what, now?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The Trollblin naive, but not meaning ill will,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
sat down for a picnic, his tummy to fill.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Okay!

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Even if he picked a safe place to eat,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
he might have looked twice before taking a seat.

No!

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
The Kotassians faced him, determined to fight.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
But though they were angry, did that make them right?

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Oh! The humanities!

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
With peaceful discussion, why, each side could see

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
that everyone needs space, a place they can be.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Prohyas: Can't we all just get along?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
[ Crying ] Yes!

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Grup, Grup, the pathos, down a notch.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
So let's learn today the trebuchet and sabre

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
can never beat love and respect for your neighbor.

[ Crying indistinctly ]

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Dude, it was, like, totally our bad.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
We were, like, on a total food vision quest.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
But, you know, we didn't know it was, like, your pad food.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Could we repay you by, like, helping you grow some new digs?

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Yeah, sure, whatever floats your boat, I guess.

Wow, New Kotassium is shaping up beautifully.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
I'll say!

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
But where did all the non-tomatoes veggies come from?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Not our Magiswords, to be sure.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
My vegetable Magiswords, they're gone!

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
It is a mystery,.

About that Kotassian treasure.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Technically, kiddos, you didn't destroy

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
the Trollblins, like I originally asked.
