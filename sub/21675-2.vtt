23:49.100 --> 23:50.633
and now she's in a world

23:50.667 --> 23:54.066
where I am in charge
and she isn't.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.100
- Three espresso martinis.
One's for Monica.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.033
And one's for someone else.
I can't remember.

23:58.066 --> 24:00.767
- It's not a democracy.
We're a team.

24:00.767 --> 24:02.333
You need to listen
to your coach.

24:02.367 --> 24:03.633
- [groans]

24:03.633 --> 24:05.333
- I'll pour the next one.
- All right.

24:05.367 --> 24:08.100
- Can you have those drinks
made in five minutes?

24:08.133 --> 24:09.500
- For sure!
- 'Cause we're gonna

24:09.533 --> 24:11.500
lose the view.
It's visual.

24:11.533 --> 24:12.500
- Visual.
Okay, perfect.

24:12.533 --> 24:13.633
[ice rattling]

24:13.633 --> 24:16.000
- So peaceful up here.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.500
- Yeah.
both: Mm-hmm.

24:17.533 --> 24:19.533
- We got some espresso
martinis.

24:19.533 --> 24:22.000
- Thank you.
- I wanna get this view for you.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
- Yes! Let's do it.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.533
- Crew picture!
- Get on your knees.

24:25.533 --> 24:26.734
[overlapping chatter]

24:26.767 --> 24:28.000
- Ready?
- This is perfect.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.066
- Beautiful.
- Yay!

24:30.100 --> 24:32.400
- Thank you all.
It's been an honor

24:32.400 --> 24:34.367
and a pleasure.
- Aw!

24:34.400 --> 24:37.000
- We're gonna go ahead
and get ready to dock.

24:37.033 --> 24:38.734
- It's so pretty right there.

24:38.767 --> 24:41.133
- Do splits in Split.
- Splits in Split!

24:41.166 --> 24:43.533
Whoo!
- Gotta have [murmurs].

24:43.533 --> 24:45.333
- Okay, so I'll put this
in there.

24:45.367 --> 24:47.133
Get ready to tuck it through.
- Hey, guys, you really

24:47.133 --> 24:48.734
need to get on the fenders
in the line.

24:48.767 --> 24:50.667
Snap to it!
- Copy that.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.400
Lines are ready.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.600
One at stern, two--
- Two at the bow.

24:55.667 --> 24:57.533
- I'm proceeding into port.

24:57.567 --> 24:58.567
You guys ready?
- Copy that.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.500
All deck crew ready.

25:00.533 --> 25:03.166
We've got Bobby up in the bow,
got Max on the midships,

25:03.200 --> 25:04.567
and myself and Malia
on the stern.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.533
- Got it. Thank you.
- All right, Max,

25:06.567 --> 25:08.433
Malia's helping me on this side.
You're in charge

25:08.433 --> 25:10.166
of both springs.
- I never done them before.

25:10.166 --> 25:12.767
- Who asks about docking
rather than real docking?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.633
I mean, who does that?
So...figure eight.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.567
So you'll put it in--
- Good timing.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.433
- If one line is loose,

25:19.433 --> 25:21.166
your boat can drift
in a certain direction

25:21.166 --> 25:22.633
and hit whatever's
close to you.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.166
And then you'll do
a lock and turn,

25:24.166 --> 25:26.166
which means
you'll just go like this...

25:26.166 --> 25:27.700
- Do the lock and turn again?
- So I'm coming around

25:27.700 --> 25:29.367
for a figure eight...

25:29.400 --> 25:30.700
- You know, I am a yacht
virgin, to be fair.

25:30.734 --> 25:32.567
It's all new to me.
- Perfect timing

25:32.600 --> 25:35.367
to learn the figure eight.
- Yeah, I know.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.533
That's how you do it.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.567
- 15 feet. 15 feet.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.467
- Wes, that's like 30 feet.

25:41.467 --> 25:44.066
Gotta work on distance.

25:44.100 --> 25:46.467
Parking fenders
still not going ashore.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.533
That one going up
fourth, please.

25:51.100 --> 25:52.567
- Uh...probably here.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.734
Oh, yeah, four.

25:53.734 --> 25:55.000
- Okay, just pull
a bit tighter.

25:55.033 --> 25:57.033
Pick up the slack.

25:57.066 --> 25:59.200
All right, we've got
all lines ashore.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.600
- Thank you.
- She's a baller parker.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.600
- Good job, deck crew.
good job.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.166
- How's everyone
doing down here?

26:05.200 --> 26:07.166
- We're so sad.
- Oh...we're so sad.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.667
- We are soaking with sweat.
- Yeah.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.567
- These pants are...
- Yeah.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.200
- Not dry.
[laughter]

26:13.233 --> 26:15.533
- Clean up, deck crew!

26:15.567 --> 26:17.200
[crashing sound]

26:17.200 --> 26:18.467
- Holy sh--!

26:18.500 --> 26:20.467
- [gasps]

26:20.500 --> 26:22.433
- What was that?
- Oh, sh--.

26:22.467 --> 26:25.433
- Oh, my God.
F---ing sh--!

26:28.233 --> 26:28.433
[crashing sound]

26:29.767 --> 26:32.066
- Holy sh--!
- [gasps]

26:32.100 --> 26:33.500
- Oh, sh--!
- Be careful!

26:33.533 --> 26:35.633
- That's scary.
There's glass all over me.

26:35.633 --> 26:37.233
- Oh, my God, hold on,
hold on, no, no, no.

26:37.233 --> 26:39.500
Be careful.
- I'm gonna go get

26:39.500 --> 26:40.767
the first-aid kit.
- There's blood everywhere.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.767
- I mean, it was like
a dream vacation.

26:42.767 --> 26:43.767
- Girls,
go get ready.

26:43.767 --> 26:44.767
- Do you guys know

26:44.767 --> 26:46.066
where the first-aid kit is?

26:46.100 --> 26:47.367
The shower in port 4
crew cabin

26:47.367 --> 26:48.600
just shattered.

26:48.633 --> 26:49.767
- What?
- What just shattered?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.066
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

26:51.100 --> 26:52.200
- Be careful.
Let me wipe it.

26:52.233 --> 26:54.066
- I know I'm new to yachting,

26:54.100 --> 26:56.633
but I'm sure the doors
aren't supposed to shatter.

26:56.667 --> 26:58.367
- What happened?
- The shower door.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.633
- If you're not wearing shoes,
put on shoes.

27:00.633 --> 27:03.266
- You need to sit down.
Where are you bleeding?

27:03.266 --> 27:04.533
- Ugh!
- Let me see what's wrong here,

27:04.567 --> 27:06.133
Hannah, watch out.
- Eh...

27:06.133 --> 27:08.066
- The hatch--

27:11.266 --> 27:13.667
- There's glass
on my face, I think.

27:13.667 --> 27:16.767
- I go right into
my firefighter EMT mode.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.533
All I'm thinking about is okay,
let's assess the situation,

27:19.533 --> 27:22.100
There's quite a bit of blood,
and I wanna find out

27:22.133 --> 27:23.533
where this major cut is.

27:23.533 --> 27:25.233
I'm not gonna
rub this anymore

27:25.266 --> 27:27.133
'cause there's little
shards all over the place.

27:27.133 --> 27:28.633
- This was so much fun.

27:28.667 --> 27:30.734
- It was amazing.
- Thanks for coming, you guys.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.533
- Oh, sh--,
there's so much blood.

27:37.567 --> 27:39.567
Ooh...
Ha...

27:41.133 --> 27:43.533
- Holy sh--!
- Yeah. The hatch fell.

27:43.533 --> 27:45.166
- Does she need stitches?
- No.

27:45.166 --> 27:47.133
- Okay.
- I can medically clear her.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.000
I'm a firefighter EMT.
I see this sh-- all the time.

27:50.033 --> 27:51.700
Hey, Hannah, is she decent?
- No.

27:51.700 --> 27:54.033
- Well, get her decent
so I can check her wounds

27:54.066 --> 27:55.567
and we can--
- Yeah, yeah,

27:55.567 --> 27:57.300
she's just getting
all the glass off her.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.300
- No, let him see her.
- She's naked and she's a woman.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.300
She doesn't want--
- I understand that, okay?

28:01.300 --> 28:03.166
I've seen a lot of naked
women in the field before,

28:03.166 --> 28:04.700
you know, professionally.

28:04.734 --> 28:07.200
- Do you want Bobby
to, like, see you like this?

28:09.033 --> 28:10.033
[murmurs, laughs]

28:10.066 --> 28:11.700
- We lucked out
on the weather.

28:11.700 --> 28:14.300
- I know, the weather
was perfect.

28:14.300 --> 28:16.166
- Thanks for clearing that up.
- Don't worry about the stuff

28:16.166 --> 28:18.133
that's in the bathroom.
I'll handle that.

28:18.166 --> 28:21.000
- She said to say nice try.
She's gonna put some clothes on.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.300
- No. I didn't say
I wanna see her naked.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.133
I said put some bras
and shorts on--

28:24.166 --> 28:25.700
- I know.
That's what I'm doing!

28:25.700 --> 28:27.200
- I'm more medically
trained than you are, Hannah.

28:27.233 --> 28:29.066
- Yeah--
- So get her dressed,

28:29.066 --> 28:30.567
and let me look at her.
- That's what I'm doing.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.467
Are you not getting that?
- You told me to go away,

28:32.500 --> 28:34.066
and that I don't
need to do this.

28:34.066 --> 28:35.600
- No, I didn't!
- You said, "She's naked,"

28:35.633 --> 28:37.600
like I wanna f---ing
see her naked, okay?

28:37.633 --> 28:39.066
I'm being a professional.

28:39.066 --> 28:41.033
- For Bobby to blow up
this much at me,

28:41.066 --> 28:44.200
he's harboring some kind of
resentment about something.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.200
Bobby can scream at me
all he wants,

28:46.200 --> 28:48.700
but he's not getting into
that room while Malia's naked.

28:48.734 --> 28:50.734
- Is she--is she decent?
- No. Yeah, she's decent.

28:50.734 --> 28:52.734
- I'm good, Bobby.
You can take a look.

28:52.767 --> 28:53.700
- Like, I'm trying
to help a girl.

28:53.734 --> 28:56.066
She "just so happens
to be pretty,"

28:56.066 --> 28:58.166
I "just so happen to
like her."

28:58.200 --> 29:00.066
But I feel like
after last charter season

29:00.066 --> 29:01.734
when Hannah and I kissed...

29:01.734 --> 29:02.767
- Good night, darling.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.734
- It's like she marked
her territory,

29:04.734 --> 29:06.066
and nobody else can have me.

29:06.066 --> 29:07.600
Oh, yeah, this is it
right here.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.100
And it's already closed up.
- Okay.

29:09.133 --> 29:10.233
- And that little guy...
you're fine.

29:10.233 --> 29:11.734
- Yeah.

29:11.767 --> 29:13.233
- I get Bobby's medically
trained

29:13.266 --> 29:14.600
and she needs to be
looked over,

29:14.633 --> 29:15.767
but I knew that
she was okay enough.

29:15.767 --> 29:17.767
Like I didn't want to
embarrass her further.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.767
- Just keep daubing that,
and it'll coagulate

29:20.000 --> 29:21.633
and seal up, and you'll be fine.

29:21.633 --> 29:24.633
- I feel very secure
having Bobby around

29:24.633 --> 29:26.767
because he knows how to
handle the situation.

29:26.767 --> 29:29.700
But he also probably wanted
to see me naked a little bit.

29:31.633 --> 29:34.033
- I'm so sad we're leaving.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.233
- You okay?

29:37.233 --> 29:38.767
- Yeah. I'm fine.

29:38.767 --> 29:40.233
- All crew, all crew,

29:40.266 --> 29:42.633
proceed to the dock,
please.

29:42.633 --> 29:44.100
- Copy that.
Thank you.

29:44.133 --> 29:45.333
- Good-bye, [murmurs].

29:48.233 --> 29:49.500
[overlapping chatter]

29:49.533 --> 29:51.767
- Thank you so much.
- Bye, sweetie.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.400
- Thank you so much.
I do hope

29:53.400 --> 29:54.533
that the push-ups were worth it.

29:54.533 --> 29:56.000
- Crazy apples!
- Oh, Jesus.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.133
Don't--
- Oh, Jesus!

29:57.133 --> 29:58.633
[laughter]

29:58.667 --> 30:01.000
- Captain, I just have to
thank you so much.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.133
We were so thrilled
when we came on the boat,

30:03.133 --> 30:06.000
and saw we had a female
captain with our girl group.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.667
And we had a blast
on the water,

30:07.667 --> 30:10.400
and they handled
everything spectacularly.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.367
This is a little something
for all of you.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.767
- Thank you very much.
- I need a big hug.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.233
Thank you so much.

30:15.266 --> 30:16.367
[muffled chatter]
All right.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.667
Thanks, everybody.
- Thank you!

30:17.667 --> 30:19.266
- Good luck.
- All right, guys,

30:19.266 --> 30:21.133
we're gonna go count
our gratuity.

30:21.133 --> 30:22.633
Main salon. Now.

30:26.266 --> 30:28.667
All right, guys.
I know you work hard,

30:28.667 --> 30:31.400
but, you know, we came
across a lotta challenges.

30:31.433 --> 30:33.433
I just wanna go over
a few things so we're smoother,

30:33.433 --> 30:35.300
'cause I wanna be a pro.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.266
And I don't want any charter
broker's client to go,

30:37.300 --> 30:39.033
"The crew weren't good."

30:39.033 --> 30:40.667
That is not acceptable, ever.

30:40.700 --> 30:42.667
We're gonna work on
the anchor count.

30:42.700 --> 30:45.400
You know, one shackle's
27.3 meters.

30:45.433 --> 30:46.700
If I say it's 60 meters,

30:46.700 --> 30:49.433
how many shackles have to...

30:49.433 --> 30:51.100
Anyway. We'll get
the anchoring down.

30:51.133 --> 30:53.166
We'll get the stern chutes
tying down,

30:53.166 --> 30:55.300
and we'll figure it out
together.

30:55.300 --> 30:58.000
Just to let you know how happy
the charter guests were,

30:58.033 --> 31:02.100
in here is $90,750 kuna.

31:02.133 --> 31:03.166
- Wait--what?

31:03.166 --> 31:07.033
- Which is 15,000 U.S. dollars.

31:07.033 --> 31:10.033
$1,375 per person.

31:10.033 --> 31:12.033
That is an awesome tip.

31:12.033 --> 31:13.333
- Awesome tip.
- That's awesome.

31:13.367 --> 31:15.200
- That beats any dive tip
I've ever made

31:15.200 --> 31:16.467
in three days.

31:16.467 --> 31:18.066
- I'm gonna take you out
for dinner,

31:18.066 --> 31:19.433
because that's my tradition
with crew.

31:19.467 --> 31:22.033
Wes will be doing

40:44.500 --> 40:46.767
- This is me
and crew drama.

40:46.767 --> 40:50.600
Ah...
- Yeah. Peace out.

40:50.633 --> 40:53.300
- Sorry. What's up?
- Don't f---ing talk to me.

40:53.333 --> 40:56.700
I know exactly what you do.
You do it every f---ing time.

40:56.734 --> 40:59.133
You f---ing cock block me.

40:59.133 --> 41:00.767
You f---ing throw me
under the bus.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.367
You say, "Oh, Bobby's
not worth it."

41:03.400 --> 41:05.533
You did it with Lauren
when we were in New York,

41:05.567 --> 41:07.367
and you're f---ing
doing it right now.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.400
- About what?
- Don't play f---ing dumb.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.333
You're not even gonna
remember it in the morning,

41:11.367 --> 41:13.400
because you're a f---ing
alcoholic.

41:13.433 --> 41:15.400
Get out of my
f---ing way.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.066
- I've got f---ing better
things to talk about

41:18.100 --> 41:22.000
than a little fricking
steroid-infused blow-up doll.

41:22.033 --> 41:23.333
- What's going on?

41:27.400 --> 41:28.767
- What have I done to you?
- All you do

41:29.000 --> 41:30.400
is f---ing throw me
under the bus.

41:30.433 --> 41:32.667
- Bobby, we weren't
talking about you.

41:32.700 --> 41:34.400
- I don't believe that
for a heartbeat.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.000
You did this exactly
in New York,

41:36.000 --> 41:37.400
and you know exactly what
I'm talking about.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.667
- If you're being
this aggressive to me--

41:39.700 --> 41:42.033
- Don't f---ing use
that word aggressive.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.533
I'm defusing the situation
and getting out of it.

41:44.567 --> 41:46.533
- Tell me what I said--
- It doesn't matter,

41:46.567 --> 41:48.033
because you'll forget it
in a minute.

41:48.033 --> 41:50.033
- No, no, no, you--
- Step out of my room,

41:50.066 --> 41:51.567
go into your bed...
- You tell me what I said bad

41:51.600 --> 41:53.433
about you.
- Good night.

41:53.467 --> 41:54.667
- I'll remember
this conversation, sweetheart.

41:54.700 --> 41:56.667
Don't you worry.

41:56.700 --> 42:00.066
I will not forget it
for a very, very long time.

42:08.166 --> 42:10.367
- F---!

42:10.400 --> 42:12.700
- Next time on "Below Deck
Mediterranean"...

42:12.734 --> 42:15.166
- Primary charter member,
Mr Skin,

42:15.166 --> 42:17.367
the founder of mrskin.com,

42:17.400 --> 42:19.033
and they would like
to schedule

42:19.066 --> 42:20.700
their Naked News photo shoot.

42:20.734 --> 42:23.066
- I'm hanging out
on a boat in Croatia

42:23.100 --> 42:25.200
with Mr. and Mrs. Skin.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.033
- There are unmentionable
parts

42:27.066 --> 42:29.066
staring right into
my eyeballs.

42:29.066 --> 42:30.667
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

42:30.700 --> 42:32.400
Oh, my gosh, I can't--

42:34.500 --> 42:36.433
- If we hit the rocks,
we're totally screwed.

42:36.467 --> 42:39.066
- Guests have absolutely
no idea what's happening.

42:39.066 --> 42:40.700
- Come push the boat.
What are you waiting for?

42:40.734 --> 42:43.133
- Push that massive,
huge boat

42:43.166 --> 42:45.100
with this little boat?
Really?

42:49.066 --> 42:50.600
- I'm not sure.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.467
- So either she's lying
or you're lying.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.433
- Can I go back to laundry?
I have a lot to do.

42:54.467 --> 42:55.600
- Thanks for your support,
Lauren.

42:55.633 --> 42:56.600
Why don't you go f--- Ben?

42:56.633 --> 42:58.734
- [laughing]

42:58.767 --> 43:00.600
- Oh, my God.
