That's it.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.976
We got to get the word out
to German intelligence.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.369
DANNY [over phone]:
Chuck, where are you?

00:21.412 --> 00:23.632
I'm in Hong Kong
tailing Cardinal Rossi.

00:23.675 --> 00:24.937
You hang low.
I'll have Shaw come meet you.

00:24.981 --> 00:25.982
Have him meet me
at Jardine House.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.331
That's where Rossi's going.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.941
Father Donnelly!

00:28.985 --> 00:30.856
The Khan sends her regards.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.380
[groaning]:
Hey.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.862
It was a biological attack.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.081
The Khan's people released

00:38.125 --> 00:39.909
an unknown toxin into the air.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.519
There's more happening.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.304
We started getting alerts
from across the globe,

00:43.347 --> 00:44.870
about an hour ago.

00:44.914 --> 00:46.133

00:51.094 --> 00:53.531
Only those who share
the genetic bloodline

00:53.575 --> 00:56.317

01:33.005 --> 01:35.138
All this setup is
for survivors.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.531
Remember that.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.794
Those cots could be body bags.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.100
We saved a lot of lives

01:40.143 --> 01:41.710
by finding out
about this attack.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.799
Unless they've already been
infected by the Khan virus.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.583
The thing is,
they don't look sick.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.890
Simon said Violet
was gonna attack

01:47.933 --> 01:49.326
on the Chinese New Year.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.067
So, either he was lying
to us-- surprise--

01:51.111 --> 01:52.199
or she jumped the gun

01:52.242 --> 01:53.635
a day early.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.854
Maybe we forced her
to change her plan.

01:55.898 --> 01:58.248
[sighs] Maybe.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.164
[indistinct chatter]

02:01.208 --> 02:03.645
I just can't shake
this feeling.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.299
All this East vs. West,

02:05.342 --> 02:07.214
this-this fanaticism,
this terror.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.737
It's not Violet.Lexi.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.521
It's not--
Something else is going on.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.828
You need to see her
for who she is.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.221
Maybe she changed
in prison

02:14.264 --> 02:16.266
or maybe Violet's always
been wearing a mask.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.964
I know who she is.

Ms. Vaziri.

Mr. McNamara.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.187
Thank you for helping
with the interviews.Yeah.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.189
Our FBI liaison says
that you have been involved

02:26.233 --> 02:27.756
in the hunt
for this terrorist.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.975
Perhaps you will note
something that we have missed.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.542
I'm happy to help.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.501
Is this everyone that was near
the site of exposure?

02:33.544 --> 02:36.025
Yes,
within a three-block radius.

02:36.068 --> 02:37.679
We're having them brought here
for quarantine,

02:37.722 --> 02:40.247
so doctors can determine
who has been infected.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.074
First hundred have arrived,

02:42.118 --> 02:44.468
but we will be ready
for almost 30,000 by nightfall.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.122
And how many infected so far?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.993
Eight dead, 100 sick.

02:48.037 --> 02:50.213
It presents itself
like the flu--

02:50.257 --> 02:53.347
mild fever, fatigue--
but it is strange.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.218
Ever since the initial attack,

02:55.262 --> 02:57.133
no one is showing
any new symptoms.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.442
Did anyone directly
witness the attack?

03:01.485 --> 03:03.487
There is a witness
who may have some answers,

03:03.531 --> 03:06.316
an executive from an office
building near the attack.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.883
I should warn you, though,

03:07.926 --> 03:10.451

03:14.716 --> 03:17.153
Follow me, please.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.205
You'd better be the ones

03:25.248 --> 03:27.207
DANNY:
Sir, the authorities
are working on that.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.947
We're here investigating
the attack.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.688
As I said,

03:30.732 --> 03:33.474
I saw a guy run from that truck
right before the blast.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.040
Now please go away.

03:35.084 --> 03:37.304
DANNY:
A guy? One... one guy?

03:37.347 --> 03:38.435
Could you identify him?

03:38.479 --> 03:39.958
Wouldn't I have done that
already?

03:40.002 --> 03:41.960
I couldn't get a good look
from my office.

03:45.355 --> 03:46.922
Do you have anything
more important going on

03:46.965 --> 03:48.532
than stopping
a worldwide terror attack?

03:48.576 --> 03:49.925
As a matter of fact, I do.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.274
So please

03:51.318 --> 03:52.841
be useful
and get me out of here

03:52.884 --> 03:54.495

03:54.538 --> 03:56.671
Danny, I'm fine.
Yeah.

03:56.714 --> 03:59.021
If I could punch him,
at least I'd be doing something.

03:59.064 --> 04:01.241
Look, I'm just as frustrated
as you are, believe me.

Oh, yeah.

Sorry.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.294
That only pisses me off more
that I didn't even see it.

Look, we won't stop her
by beating ourselves up.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.211
Okay?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.473
We stopped this
from being much worse

04:16.517 --> 04:17.953

04:22.958 --> 04:24.525
Well, for starters,

04:24.568 --> 04:26.091
there's this little voice
in the back of my head

04:26.135 --> 04:27.963

to focus on that guy.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.791

he's the only one in here

04:29.834 --> 04:31.967

he saw one attacker

04:33.708 --> 04:35.231
at the moment
of detonation.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.015
Which means
potentially one bad guy

04:37.059 --> 04:38.539
could have been swept up
in the quarantine.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.367
Didn't expect the German police
to be so close.

Look.

It's the same antibiotic
we used at Aralsk-7.

06:14.722 --> 06:18.203
We were protecting ourselves
against anthrax in Kazakhstan.

06:18.247 --> 06:21.076
A bacteria, not a virus.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.904
Violet would know that.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.949
She would know that vancomycin
wouldn't work against the virus.

06:24.993 --> 06:28.126
So, either she intentionally
gave her own soldier

06:28.170 --> 06:31.086
something that wouldn't
protect him,

Not your ring, per se,

It means you control
the Vatican Bank, yes?

when the whole bloody world
is coming apart.

11:47.532 --> 11:50.231
What if that's the point?[sighs] Hmm.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.928
Look.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.104
These videos that are flooding
social media right now.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.540
This is Rome.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.020
They're saying
that was last night,

11:57.064 --> 11:58.413
but this happened
three years ago.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.110
Chuck and I were
at that game.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.199
I remember 'cause we got stuck
on the subway for two hours.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.810
Violet's posting
these clips

12:03.853 --> 12:06.334
to make it look like
society's falling apart.

12:07.248 --> 12:08.771
So it's all coordinated.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.686
Genghis Khan wasn't just
a great general.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.383
He was theatrical.Okay.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.820
The idea that his army
were demons from hell--

12:13.863 --> 12:15.256
that was all him.

12:15.299 --> 12:18.215
He would attack
the outer edges of an empire,

12:18.259 --> 12:20.261
let people escape into
the center, spreading panic.

12:20.304 --> 12:23.917
He used calculated rumors and
propaganda to stir up fear.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.528
Now, fear sent people flooding
into the cities for protection,

12:26.571 --> 12:28.791
slowing military response,
clogging the streets,

12:28.835 --> 12:31.359
spreading disease
along with the chaos.

12:31.402 --> 12:34.231
I mean, the battle was half over
before he even arrived.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.972
That's controlled chaos.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.975
Overwhelming the system is
part of the strategy.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.325
[scoffs]The virus isn't real,
but the panic is.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.762
It's a setup.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.768
I think I know
what her plan is.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.298
This doesn't scare me,
you know.

12:57.341 --> 13:00.867
This isn't the first time
I've been tied up.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.607
[sighs]

13:02.651 --> 13:04.566
That didn't come out right.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.873
You could at least
offer me that chair.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.875
It's just courtesy.

13:13.227 --> 13:14.445
[grunting]

13:20.321 --> 13:22.671
Should've offered
me that chair.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.673
It's just courtesy.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.718
[wood clatters on ground][groans]

13:26.762 --> 13:28.808
[laughing]Dude, that was awesome.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.200
I know, right?You were like Macho Man.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.811
Oh, yeah. Let's go.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.861
Come on, little buddy.

13:38.905 --> 13:39.906
[groans softly]

13:41.385 --> 13:43.997
Hey, you gonna call me that
every time you rescue me?

13:45.912 --> 13:47.478
You said something
more important

13:47.522 --> 13:48.871
than terror was happening.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.220
What?

13:50.264 --> 13:51.874
I work for
the European Central Bank.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.572
Yes, yes, the penthouse.
You told us. Get to the point.

13:54.616 --> 13:57.401
And I was evacuated
and still not allowed back in,

13:57.445 --> 14:00.056
which has made doing my job
nearly impossible.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.841
Now, these attacks

14:01.884 --> 14:03.886
have caused panic
all across Europe,

14:03.930 --> 14:06.106
but all of
our emergency aid is failing.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.759
What kind of emergency aid?

14:07.803 --> 14:09.936
We should have been flooding
the branches with cash

14:09.979 --> 14:11.633
to avoid a run on the banks,

14:11.676 --> 14:14.157
but these maniacs have attacked
all our shipments.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.159
So, what happens now?

14:16.203 --> 14:17.857
In disasters like this--

14:17.900 --> 14:21.382
9/11 or even the 2008 crash--

14:21.425 --> 14:24.124
friendly nations
electronically transfer

14:24.167 --> 14:27.214
large deposits
to struggling banks

14:27.257 --> 14:28.650
to prevent total collapse.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.304
That's probably a big number.

14:30.347 --> 14:33.133
Yes, it is.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.700
$1.5 trillion.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.227
This is why
she picked Frankfurt.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.838
She wants to clear out
the European Central Bank.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.015
All these attacks,
the panic, the confusion.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.669
This isn't about terror.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.410
This is a heist.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.286
[busy chatter]

14:56.330 --> 14:57.722
DANNY:Becker!

14:57.766 --> 14:58.941
There is no
DNA-based virus.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.421
Go.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.726
The Khan is after money.

15:01.770 --> 15:02.727
It's a robbery.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.207
What?
Yes.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.861
Look around you.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.820
We're already dealing
with a biological attack.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.605
I can't chase theories.DOCTOR: Agent Becker.

15:10.648 --> 15:11.954
Yes.
We got the results back.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.477
He's right.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.740
Doesn't matter if
the DNA attacks are real or not.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.134
It's as she planned.
All of it.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.006
HERMANN:Wait, wait.
Bugger.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.225
I think you were right.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.618
About everything.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.663
The transfer isn't working.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.056
The bank servers
all over Europe

15:27.100 --> 15:30.016
are being overwhelmed
by DDoS attacks.

15:30.059 --> 15:32.192
Now, there are
countermeasures in place.Hackers

15:32.235 --> 15:33.758
on government payroll
should have been called in.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.195
No, they're all dead.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.327
Violet's army wiped them out
across the globe.

15:37.371 --> 15:40.026
Still, there are
backup systems.DANNY: Destroyed.

15:40.069 --> 15:43.333
By the Khan's attacks on the
server ships in the Atlantic.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.902
Every single one of her attacks
had the appearance of terror

15:46.946 --> 15:49.296
but actually disabled security
measures needed to stop her.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.993
She played us
from the very beginning.

15:51.037 --> 15:53.039
Okay. If the U.S. can't transfer
to Europe,

15:53.082 --> 15:54.127
what's the backup plan?

15:54.170 --> 15:55.998
They reroute.Where?

15:56.042 --> 15:58.783
Right now the only possible
path for the transfer

15:58.827 --> 16:00.394
is through Hong Kong.Hong Kong.

16:00.437 --> 16:03.005
That's it. Yes.
That's where she'll hit.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.312
You need to call,
stop the transfer.

16:05.355 --> 16:08.663
I-I don't have anywhere near
the authorization for that.

16:08.706 --> 16:09.925
Even if I did,
they wouldn't believe me.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.014
This is disastrous.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.494
You must understand.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.800
If $1.5 trillion vanishes

16:15.844 --> 16:18.368
from the economy,
it causes a downward spiral

16:18.412 --> 16:20.762
that will crash the West
if not the world.

16:20.805 --> 16:24.374
People will go to the bank
and their savings will be gone.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.333
This will affect
billions of people.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.682
We need to get to Hong Kong.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.379
All the airports are shut down.

16:29.423 --> 16:32.295
If only we knew someone local
with a private jet.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.039
Of course you do.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.127
Let's go.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.310
VIOLET:You'll be pleased to know
the Cardinal's in line.

16:47.354 --> 16:50.183
It's so much easier to blackmail
someone that has no morals.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.749
[chuckles]

16:51.793 --> 16:53.664
Almost everything's in place.

16:55.101 --> 16:58.495
Lexi and Danny have
disappeared from Frankfurt.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.323
But I'm sure that
they still plan

17:00.367 --> 17:02.064
on being a pain
in my ass.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.284
They're too far behind you
for them to stop you now.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.981
Lexi's anger clouds
her judgment,

17:06.025 --> 17:09.419
and nothing makes her angrier
than being betrayed.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.813
[chuckles]:
Which you brilliantly engineered
with Danny as well.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.815
That's her other weakness.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.470
They may have beaten you,

17:16.513 --> 17:18.820
but they will not touch me.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.478
HARDWICK:
Ah. The last chess piece.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.088
You have one last task,

17:26.132 --> 17:28.047
and then everything
will be ready.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.528
Whatever my Khan needs.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.575
[phone buzzes]

17:35.619 --> 17:37.708
Yeah?

17:37.752 --> 17:39.710
The priest escaped?

17:39.754 --> 17:41.625
What?
How?

DANNY:
Hey.

Treasure Squad, assemble.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.871
Wasn't sure you got our texts.Yeah.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.786
I'm glad you're okay.Get in here, tiger.

18:11.829 --> 18:14.136
[grunts]It's good to see you.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.485
Yeah, we didn't get
service back

18:15.529 --> 18:16.791
until we crossed
over Pakistan.Hey.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.098
I'm sorry about Kate.I know.

Look, all of Europe is in chaos.

18:26.409 --> 18:28.933
Seems quiet here
in Hong Kong, though.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.805
Well, Chinese New Year
starts tonight.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.155
Violet's terror attacks
in Europe are a world away.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.896
Look, the attacks,
they're not for terror.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.899
She's stealing $1.5 trillion.

18:37.942 --> 18:39.640
D-Damn.
That-That's a lot of money.

18:39.683 --> 18:42.425
Yeah. And she's forcing it
to route through Hong Kong.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.253
She's gonna launder it
somehow.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.125
Which means she'll only have
a few options.

18:47.735 --> 18:48.997
Yes?
Chuck.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.738
I know how she's gonna do it.

18:50.781 --> 18:53.175
We've been following
Cardinal Rossi.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.482
By the way, thank you
for saving my life

18:55.525 --> 18:57.571
by chair-punching those guys
that kidnapped me.

Chair-punching? Without me?

19:00.356 --> 19:01.662
We all lead
very exciting lives now.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.229
Listen, the point is,

19:03.272 --> 19:06.493
the Khan's men showed up
to meet with the Cardinal.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.625
And Rossi's on the board
of the Vatican Bank.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.975
Ah, definitely
nothing shady about

19:11.019 --> 19:12.629
a church having
its own bank.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.327
Look, it's one of the
biggest banks in the world.

19:14.370 --> 19:17.199
They've got massive holdings,
very little oversight.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.940
And, to be frank,

19:18.983 --> 19:21.072
a pretty shady history
of money-laundering scandals,

19:21.116 --> 19:23.292
some of them even involving
the Mafia.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.989
Wait, Godfather IIIwas real?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.295
That film is so underrated.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.470
No, it's not.

19:27.514 --> 19:28.906
Hold up.Guys!

19:29.777 --> 19:31.213
Rossi has the power
to oversee

19:31.257 --> 19:33.389
a massive transfer
of funds like that

19:33.433 --> 19:34.912
and to break it up
into so many pieces

19:34.956 --> 19:36.566
that no one would ever notice.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.612
And Violet has a criminal
network all over the world

19:38.655 --> 19:40.091
to make withdrawals.

19:40.135 --> 19:43.094
From any of
over 200,000 Catholic parishes

19:43.138 --> 19:44.270
around the world.

19:44.313 --> 19:46.010
Whatever happened
to all that guilt

19:46.054 --> 19:47.360
Catholics are supposed to have?

19:47.403 --> 19:48.883
Some of us carry all of it.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.189
Touché.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.581
How's Violet going
to get the money

19:51.625 --> 19:53.801
from the Hong Kong bank
to Rossi?

19:53.844 --> 19:57.021
When I stayed back to clean out
Violet's HQ with the CIA,

19:57.065 --> 19:58.675
we found a bunch of these.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.460
This is a remote access tool,

20:00.503 --> 20:03.245

Uh, it can hack signals.
Remotely control devices.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.823
Like a nuclear bomb?
No.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.346
Not powerful enough.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.000
It's more of a router
to bounce electronic messages

20:19.043 --> 20:20.523
from one place to another.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.568
DANNY:
Or...

20:21.611 --> 20:23.657
intercept them.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.789
This whole time,

20:25.833 --> 20:28.575
she's needed one thing
to pull off this heist,

20:28.618 --> 20:31.142

chasing it down for her.

She needed a Trojan Horse.

A way to get the remote
access tool inside the walls

DANNY:
Arthur Chan.

That's why she wanted me
to meet him instead of her.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.304
She already knew him.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.045
I bet she got the idea
for this whole heist

31:08.170 --> 31:09.650
Are you planning to use it?

31:09.693 --> 31:11.870
Both.
Great.

31:13.306 --> 31:16.309
Rossi gets caught on the
night of our transfer?

31:16.352 --> 31:18.180
It's no coincidence.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.008
You don't think McNamara
and Vaziri

31:20.052 --> 31:21.401
have got anything to do
with it?

31:21.444 --> 31:22.619
They're on the other side
of the world by now,

31:22.663 --> 31:23.882
chasing their tails.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.753
They're here. I know it.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.192
Tell our men to find Chan.

31:33.413 --> 31:36.764
And kill Danny and Lexi
on sight.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.254
You're the only person
who can get inside that room.

31:48.297 --> 31:49.908
Come with us now,

31:49.951 --> 31:51.213
and we can stop this
before anyone else gets hurt.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.519
My security can deal with her.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.651
LEXI:
She's got a bloody army
with her.

31:54.695 --> 31:57.002
And she won't leave until she
gets what she came here for.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.351
Me?

31:58.394 --> 32:00.092
Well,
technically all she needs is

32:00.135 --> 32:01.528
your eye and your hand.

32:01.571 --> 32:04.139
The rest of you just,
well, slows her down.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.881
I accept your offer.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.709
Smart move.
Okay.

32:08.752 --> 32:10.406
Let's see if we can get out
of here without a gunfight.

32:10.450 --> 32:11.538
I got an idea.

32:11.581 --> 32:13.670
Shaw, we need a way out.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.111
VIOLET:
That's him.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.982
In a priceless Namsrai.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.549
Typical.

32:22.592 --> 32:24.986
Hey, Arthur.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.683
Arthur.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.170
What's going on?

32:35.214 --> 32:36.955
We're too late.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.260
They've already got him.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.262
Hey, hey.
Where are you going?

32:40.306 --> 32:41.655
The Dragon Gate.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.309
You can't go.
I'll go.

32:44.266 --> 32:46.355
There are cameras everywhere.

32:46.399 --> 32:48.096
I thought the whole plan is

32:48.140 --> 32:49.880
that nobody's supposed to know
who the Great Khan is.

32:49.924 --> 32:53.449
You head out there,
and everybody will.

32:53.493 --> 32:54.885
Fine.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.278
I'll send a detail with you.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.152
For your protection.

33:02.502 --> 33:05.026
I look forward to celebrating
with you later.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.115
[kiss]

33:20.389 --> 33:21.695
[sighs]

33:21.738 --> 33:23.305
This is so much easier to do
while walking.

33:23.349 --> 33:24.654
CHAN:
What does that mean?

33:24.698 --> 33:26.439
It's a long story.
We should hurry.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.223
[beeps]

33:29.050 --> 33:30.660
[electrical whirring]

33:35.665 --> 33:37.928
[beeping and whirring]

33:37.972 --> 33:39.887
[lock clicks]

33:43.064 --> 33:44.935
Don't touch anything.

33:45.936 --> 33:48.026
[fireworks popping]

33:51.681 --> 33:54.423
The transfer was initiated.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.471
But it was halted
before it completed.

33:58.514 --> 34:01.822
$1.5 trillion,
and it's all in there

34:01.865 --> 34:04.346
because I had
to possess this relic.

34:04.390 --> 34:07.262
The global economy will crumble,
and it's all my fault.

34:07.306 --> 34:11.223
Hey, Arthur.
It is not too late.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.876
We get the Banner
to the authorities,

34:12.920 --> 34:14.269
and all that money goes back

34:14.313 --> 34:16.097
to where it's
supposed to be.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.968
And the Khan is defeated.

34:19.840 --> 34:20.884
All right.

34:26.977 --> 34:28.544
Let's go.

34:30.329 --> 34:32.983
Shaw, we have the Banner
and we're headed down.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.637
SHAW [over comm]:
Figure Violet's not far behind,

34:34.681 --> 34:36.248
so I planned
a more subtle escape.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.988
Meet me down below.

34:38.032 --> 34:39.512
That's a good idea.
We'll see you in two minutes.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.868
DANNY:
We have to be careful.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.435
Once we're outside,

34:49.478 --> 34:50.914
the streets will be
filled with people.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.655
Perfect for trying
to steal away

34:52.699 --> 34:54.614
with a priceless
eight-foot golden spear.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.572
The subbasement's
right around the corner.

34:56.616 --> 34:57.965
I need to contact the bank,

34:58.008 --> 34:59.227
the international authorities,
everyone,

34:59.271 --> 35:00.881
as soon as possible.

35:00.924 --> 35:03.318
We need to get as far
from here as we can first.

35:03.362 --> 35:04.711
What happened?

35:04.754 --> 35:06.582
[fireworks popping]

35:06.626 --> 35:08.367
[loud pop]

35:17.506 --> 35:21.162
[gasps]

35:21.206 --> 35:23.251
Should auld acquaintance
be forgot.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.559
Poor Arthur.

35:26.602 --> 35:29.562
At least he got to see
the New Year off with a bang.

35:29.605 --> 35:31.607
[gunshots]OFFICER: Hong Kong Police!
Put down your weapons!

35:34.219 --> 35:36.308
Did you call the cops?I thought you did.

35:36.351 --> 35:37.613
Actually, I called them.

35:37.657 --> 35:38.875
On your knees, Khan!

35:38.919 --> 35:41.139
I am not the Khan.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.793
I-I am not the Khan! Okay?

35:43.837 --> 35:45.143
Wait, he's...

35:45.186 --> 35:46.535
he's actually telling
the truth.

35:46.579 --> 35:48.537
Yeah, I've been on your side
this whole time.

35:48.581 --> 35:50.148
You've been on your side
this whole time.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.975
We'll get this all sorted out
at the station.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.110
HARDWICK:
Of course she set me up
to be her fall guy.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.286
She set me up
right from the start.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.944
And this was my one
chance to escape.

36:03.987 --> 36:06.076
Well, I did warn you,
didn't I?

36:08.035 --> 36:10.733
SHAW:
Guys, I just followed a bunch
of her men through the caves.

36:10.777 --> 36:14.476
They didn't see me,
but I've got bad news.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.218
What, worse than Chan being
killed and us getting arrested?

36:17.262 --> 36:18.698
Way worse.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.613
That attack on
the Russian military base,

36:20.656 --> 36:22.658
she definitely stole a nuke.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.664
Oh, boy.Oh, God.

36:36.063 --> 36:38.761
[lively chatter]

36:42.200 --> 36:44.811
Violet's going after that banner
with everything she has.

36:44.854 --> 36:46.639
DANNY:
And once she has it,

36:46.682 --> 36:48.989
she'll blow up Hong Kong
to cover her tracks.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.868
We found where they're taking
Simon Hardwick and my banner.

37:00.522 --> 37:02.307
MAN:
My Khan.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.267
I want it back.

37:14.928 --> 37:18.279
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

37:18.323 --> 37:21.587
And FORD.
We go further, so you can.
