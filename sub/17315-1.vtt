00:26.052 --> 00:27.285
I can't believe our school

00:27.287 --> 00:28.704
throws homecoming
in the old gym.

00:28.739 --> 00:30.569
Of all the shitty ways
to save a penny.

00:30.604 --> 00:31.318
Come on, Loren.

00:31.353 --> 00:33.046
Just be stoked
we're finally in high school

00:33.127 --> 00:34.327
and can actually go this year.

00:34.329 --> 00:36.133
<i>So, it was your lame idea</i>

00:36.168 --> 00:38.192
to come to this stinky-ass
porta-potty of a party?

00:38.801 --> 00:40.961
Wasn't it
Annie's sophomore boy toy

00:40.972 --> 00:42.634
that had this brilliant idea?

00:42.669 --> 00:43.794
Yeah.
Like you aren't aching

00:43.909 --> 00:45.990
to see your own junior boy toy,
Jaclyn?

00:46.025 --> 00:48.350
Yeah, Jaclyn.
Isn't Karl a little old for you?

00:48.385 --> 00:49.180
Whatever.

00:49.182 --> 00:50.481
Guys, put out that cigarette

00:50.483 --> 00:51.483
before we all get detention.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.418
Those sophomore bros
you guys hang out with

00:53.420 --> 00:54.860
are a bunch of tools.

00:54.895 --> 00:56.434
Ah, Steve, but they're tools

00:56.457 --> 00:58.173
that can drive cars,
right, girls?

00:58.208 --> 00:59.973
- Ugh. Jerks!
- It wasn't funny.

01:00.008 --> 01:02.362
I know.
It was fucking hilarious.

01:02.364 --> 01:04.431
Loren, they won't let us in.

01:04.433 --> 01:06.467
Hey, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:06.469 --> 01:09.370
Sorry, freshmen.
No fishies allowed.

01:09.372 --> 01:11.006
The dance
is for everyone, meathead.

01:11.008 --> 01:12.808
- Move.
- Wow, Steve.

01:12.810 --> 01:14.177
Your girl's
got some mouth on her.

01:14.279 --> 01:15.845
Maybe you should, uh,
put something in there,

01:15.847 --> 01:17.481
- uh, shut her up.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:17.483 --> 01:18.783
Come on, guys.
They're with us.

01:18.785 --> 01:20.719
So, what?
We just decided --

01:20.721 --> 01:24.424
we don't want any sophomores
allowed in here either.

01:24.426 --> 01:26.759
But, you know,
we may, uh, reconsider

01:26.761 --> 01:28.929
if you give us
that, uh, Spirit Baton.

01:28.931 --> 01:30.364
Yeah, right.

01:30.366 --> 01:31.533
Sophomores won it
fair and square.

01:31.535 --> 01:35.838
Well, I guess
you ain't getting in then.

01:38.409 --> 01:39.275
Real mature.

01:39.277 --> 01:40.811
Man, you got
to be kidding me.

01:40.813 --> 01:41.778
Sorry, Karl.

01:41.780 --> 01:44.881
Looks like you
and your little fishie buddies

01:44.883 --> 01:46.851
have to find another pond
to go swim in.

01:46.853 --> 01:49.888
- Aw, hell with this.
- Karl.

01:49.890 --> 01:51.758
Dude, wait up.

01:56.397 --> 01:58.933
That was perfect.

01:58.935 --> 02:02.037
Yeah.

02:02.039 --> 02:02.939
20 bucks?

02:02.941 --> 02:05.541
To guarantee you
and all three of your friends

02:05.543 --> 02:07.410
- get laid tonight?
- That was the deal.

02:07.412 --> 02:10.913
Sorry, Billy.
Price just tripled.

02:13.386 --> 02:14.552
It's still worth it.

02:14.554 --> 02:17.990
Hey, Billy.
Give it to her good.

02:20.295 --> 02:22.429
Karl, man.

02:23.564 --> 02:26.467
Dude, come on, man.
Just chill.

02:28.439 --> 02:29.070
Okay.

02:29.072 --> 02:31.607
Yeah, forget them.
It's not worth it.

02:31.609 --> 02:32.374
What?

02:32.376 --> 02:33.977
I say y'all
should've kicked their butts.

02:33.979 --> 02:36.046
I didn't get all fine like this
for nothing.

02:36.048 --> 02:39.517
Yeah. They're, uh, senior
linebackers there, Jackie.

02:39.519 --> 02:41.419
You fight them,
you fight the whole team.

02:41.421 --> 02:42.354
Guys, it's over.

02:42.356 --> 02:43.621
Can we just get the hell
out of here now?

02:43.623 --> 02:46.827
Yeah. Maybe we should
just call it a night.

02:46.829 --> 02:48.095
Wait, where's Billy?

02:48.097 --> 02:49.563
I'm right here.

02:49.565 --> 02:52.334
I think everyone wants to go.

02:52.336 --> 02:53.501
Wait --

02:53.503 --> 02:55.437
guys...The party
is just getting started.

02:55.439 --> 02:56.972
Geez, Billy.
Where'd you get that?

02:56.974 --> 02:58.607
Don't worry about it.

02:58.609 --> 03:01.378
We can't just booze it up
in the courtyard.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.112
Who said anything

03:02.114 --> 03:05.549
about boozing it up
in the courtyard?

03:10.123 --> 03:12.958
I don't know
if this is such a good idea.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.763
Actually, it's a great idea.

03:15.765 --> 03:16.496
Good job, Billy.

03:16.498 --> 03:20.134
Maybe you're not as much
of a dry spot as I thought.

03:20.136 --> 03:21.970
Thanks...I think.

03:21.972 --> 03:23.071
Come, darling.

03:23.073 --> 03:25.975
Let's dance.

03:25.977 --> 03:28.946
All right, class.
Attention.

03:28.948 --> 03:30.815
Yes, miss Russell.

03:30.817 --> 03:32.150
I would like each of you all

03:32.152 --> 03:33.151
to write a three-page report

03:33.153 --> 03:34.853
on Shakespeare's
"taming of the shrew"

03:34.855 --> 03:37.623
and why it's such
a chauvinistic piece of --

03:37.625 --> 03:39.893
how about I tame
your shrew?

03:39.895 --> 03:43.865
<i>Hey.
That's my line.</i>

03:46.168 --> 03:49.138
Hey, I need
to show you something.

03:58.751 --> 03:59.750
Geez, Billy.

03:59.752 --> 04:00.818
Where'd all this come from?

04:00.820 --> 04:04.189
My brother, he hooked me --

04:04.191 --> 04:07.059
he hooked us up
for our one-month anniversary.

04:07.061 --> 04:09.964
That's really sweet,
but come on.

04:09.966 --> 04:12.567
One month
isn't much to celebrate.

04:12.569 --> 04:13.535
Are you kidding me?

04:13.537 --> 04:17.505
This has been the happiest month
of my entire life.

04:27.653 --> 04:29.687
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

04:29.689 --> 04:32.025
I mean, I've had a lot of fun
with you, too.

04:32.027 --> 04:35.528
Just I'm not ready
for...You know.

04:35.530 --> 04:36.230
For what?

04:36.232 --> 04:38.766
That thing in your pants

04:38.768 --> 04:40.202
pressed against me right now.

04:40.204 --> 04:41.936
And just, you know,
we're both really young,

04:41.938 --> 04:44.006
and we have plenty of time,
so we should just --

04:44.008 --> 04:45.040
I know.
Exactly.

04:45.042 --> 04:46.709
<i>We are young,
so we should take advantage</i>

04:46.711 --> 04:47.876
of every moment that we have.

04:47.878 --> 04:49.479
Billy, I said no, okay?

04:49.481 --> 04:50.714
Annie, I know you want to.

04:50.716 --> 04:53.117
Come on. A little petting
once in a while is fine,

04:53.119 --> 04:53.952
but you are drunk.

04:53.954 --> 04:56.021
And can we please just go back
with everyone else?

04:56.023 --> 04:56.956
You know, Annie,

04:56.958 --> 04:58.924
you can be such
a ripe little tease sometimes.

04:58.926 --> 05:00.193
And you can be a ripe asshole.

05:00.195 --> 05:01.828
You know what?
If you're gonna be

05:01.830 --> 05:03.630
a little bitch like that,
I got a real woman out there

05:03.632 --> 05:05.199
that's willing to give it up
to me right now.

05:05.201 --> 05:08.136
Go for it.
Now get your slimy hands off me!

05:09.073 --> 05:10.539
What the hell is your problem?

05:10.541 --> 05:11.840
Do you know
how much all of this cost?

05:11.842 --> 05:13.276
I'm sorry.

05:13.278 --> 05:14.577
You know what?

05:14.579 --> 05:17.047
I think you need
to be taught a lesson.

05:18.084 --> 05:21.218
Stop! No! Stop!

05:21.220 --> 05:23.121
Stop!

05:23.123 --> 05:24.556
Stop!

05:26.127 --> 05:27.960
Please, just stop!

05:27.962 --> 05:30.130
Stop it!

05:33.569 --> 05:35.703
Come on. Go.

05:41.045 --> 05:43.713
Loren, truth or dare?

05:43.715 --> 05:45.983
Truth --
Billy is a real prick.

05:45.985 --> 05:48.019
Holy shit.
What happened in there?

05:48.021 --> 05:49.855
Are you guys okay?

06:09.813 --> 06:12.148
Let me out!

06:13.718 --> 06:15.588
Annie Morgan, you slut!

06:15.590 --> 06:18.658
Let me out right now!

06:20.160 --> 06:22.330
What did Billy do to her?

06:22.332 --> 06:24.030
Nothing yet, but he tried.

06:24.032 --> 06:26.834
Guys, I just want to go home.

06:26.836 --> 06:28.169
Look, just give me the keys.

06:28.171 --> 06:29.671
- I'll go talk to him.
- No.

06:29.673 --> 06:32.709
You can't just leave him
locked in the closet.

06:32.711 --> 06:34.344
Watch me.

06:36.247 --> 06:39.683
Annie Morgan, open up this door!

06:50.365 --> 06:52.899
Fire!

06:52.901 --> 06:55.336
Guys, come on!

06:55.338 --> 06:57.071
Please!

06:58.944 --> 07:02.078
What's going on out here?

07:03.348 --> 07:04.849
Oh, shit.

07:04.851 --> 07:07.151
Shouldn't
you all be at the dance?

07:07.153 --> 07:08.787
Those asshole senior linemen

07:08.789 --> 07:10.822
wouldn't let us into the dance,
principal Patterson.

07:10.824 --> 07:12.725
You should have
reported that to us.

07:12.727 --> 07:14.927
You guy
are not allowed out here.

07:14.929 --> 07:17.665
Hey -- hey, guys.

07:17.667 --> 07:21.036
Allen,
what is going on over there?

07:25.009 --> 07:27.410
Somebody get
a fire extinguisher!

07:31.382 --> 07:34.217
Oh, it's hot!

08:48.914 --> 08:50.412
As you can see,
our theme this year

08:50.414 --> 08:53.184
is going up to amp up
the scheme of school colors

08:53.186 --> 08:55.119
as you head your way
up the hall.

08:55.121 --> 08:56.454
Isn't it wonderful?

08:56.456 --> 08:58.022
We're all finally
having ourselves

08:58.024 --> 09:00.025
a real homecoming
around here again.

09:00.027 --> 09:01.493
No.
I think it's a huge mistake.

09:01.495 --> 09:04.031
Well, don't you
think it's wonderful, coach?

09:04.033 --> 09:06.467
Oh, it's wonderful,
all right.

09:06.469 --> 09:08.870
Honey, can we keep focusing

09:08.872 --> 09:09.938
on the task at hand?

09:09.940 --> 09:13.142
It's nearly 9:00, and we still
have two halls to judge.

09:13.144 --> 09:15.278
Sorry, dear.

09:15.280 --> 09:19.049
All right. We're done.

09:19.051 --> 09:19.950
Thank God.

09:19.952 --> 09:21.352
Can we leave now?

09:21.354 --> 09:22.453
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

09:22.455 --> 09:24.189
Oh, uh,
Karl's off in a few,

09:24.191 --> 09:26.826
so I'll probably just head
over to the station.

09:26.828 --> 09:28.460
Surprise, surprise.

09:28.462 --> 09:30.095
Oh, come on.
It's not like you two

09:30.097 --> 09:33.834
aren't up each other's butts
24/7, too, okay?

09:33.836 --> 09:35.269
Vulgar.

09:35.271 --> 09:36.872
True, but vulgar.

09:36.874 --> 09:39.875
So, is Karl coming
to the dance tomorrow night?

09:39.877 --> 09:40.943
Are you kidding me?

09:40.945 --> 09:42.912
He wouldn't be caught dead
back in this place.

09:42.914 --> 09:44.380
I mean, plus, he's on duty.

09:44.382 --> 09:45.482
Aw.

09:45.484 --> 09:48.987
So sad
how we miss that old Karl.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.023
You know what?

09:51.025 --> 09:52.624
Both of you guys
can kiss my butt, okay?

09:52.626 --> 09:55.495
And what a cute butt it is.
Don't you think?

09:55.497 --> 09:59.000
- See you.
- Bye.

10:01.103 --> 10:03.338
Smoking kills, didn't you hear?

10:03.340 --> 10:04.172
Ha!

10:04.174 --> 10:06.141
Gee, and this coming from
the one that got me started.

10:06.143 --> 10:08.444
You guys decide skip
hall decorations this year?

10:08.446 --> 10:11.615
Whatever. It's
a stupid token "lame"-coming

10:11.617 --> 10:12.482
for our senior year.

10:12.484 --> 10:14.584
Wade asked for our help,
remember?

10:14.586 --> 10:16.420
- In person?
- No.

10:16.422 --> 10:17.955
At the pep rally for the class.

10:17.957 --> 10:18.991
Exactly my point.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.027
He put this entire thing
together, Nora.

10:21.029 --> 10:22.027
You should be proud of him.

10:22.029 --> 10:24.063
Yeah. I mean,
it's really impressive.

10:24.065 --> 10:25.398
Yeah, it's really impressive.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.401
He's such a go-getter
these days.

10:27.403 --> 10:28.636
Bitchy much?

10:28.638 --> 10:30.940
You should be happy for wade
making class pres.

10:30.942 --> 10:33.342
Oh, I kid!
I kid!

10:33.344 --> 10:35.279
You know, I still love wade,

10:35.281 --> 10:38.148
even though he did ditch me
when he got too school for cool.

10:38.150 --> 10:41.152
Speaking of ditching,
did anyone see Annie?

10:41.154 --> 10:42.553
She wasn't in class
this morning.

10:42.555 --> 10:44.222
I thought you and Annie
were on the Fritz.

10:44.224 --> 10:45.691
Annie's on the Fritz
with everybody.

10:45.693 --> 10:47.927
She's barely even talking
to her own parents.

10:47.929 --> 10:50.330
Is she still popping
those antidepressants?

10:50.332 --> 10:53.567
I wouldn't know.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.102
Sorry.

10:55.104 --> 10:56.003
Hey, Loren!

10:56.005 --> 10:58.306
Loren
just ain't like she used to be.

10:58.308 --> 11:01.477
Aw, I bet there's a
firecracker in there somewhere.

11:01.479 --> 11:03.112
- I don't know.
- Hey.

11:03.114 --> 11:06.316
Want to find somewhere fun
to shag?

11:06.318 --> 11:07.985
Oh, Robby.

11:07.987 --> 11:09.587
You're such a romantic.

11:19.134 --> 11:22.136
God, Nora
is such a brat these days.

11:22.138 --> 11:23.205
Oh, come on.

11:23.207 --> 11:26.408
Like she said,
she learned from the best.

11:26.410 --> 11:28.177
Real funny, jerk-o.

11:29.047 --> 11:31.281
Do you think Annie's all right?

11:31.283 --> 11:34.185
Yeah.
I'm sure she's fine.

11:34.187 --> 11:36.687
She's probably just not
into all this homecoming stuff.

11:36.689 --> 11:39.424
If she's not back tomorrow,
just give her a call.

11:39.426 --> 11:41.227
If she didn't come
the day before homecoming,

11:41.229 --> 11:43.396
I don't think
she's gonna come on homecoming.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.399
Yeah.
You're right.

11:45.401 --> 11:47.301
How about we just stop by
and check on her?

11:47.303 --> 11:49.169
- You don't mind?
- No.

11:49.171 --> 11:51.774
As long as I can get something
to eat first.

11:51.776 --> 11:54.143
Sure.
And, thanks.

11:54.145 --> 11:56.046
I'll feel better if she is okay.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.748
Great.
Let's do it.

12:05.493 --> 12:08.594
Whoo.

12:13.469 --> 12:15.603
You can't smoke in here.

12:15.605 --> 12:17.205
Why not?

12:17.207 --> 12:18.373
I need a fix.

12:18.375 --> 12:19.541
I sure as hell didn't get one

12:19.543 --> 12:21.109
from two-seconds twiggy
down there.

12:21.111 --> 12:23.513
What do you expect?
It's been almost a week.

12:23.515 --> 12:26.315
<i>It's two-seconds tower,
not twiggy.</i>

12:28.054 --> 12:30.254
Whoa.
Was that janitor Fred's?

12:30.256 --> 12:32.457
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:32.459 --> 12:35.495
Check it out.
"I'm Fred the fireman."

12:40.501 --> 12:42.837
Let's do it again.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.775
Damn kids.

12:46.777 --> 12:49.412
Condoms off!
Clothes on!

12:49.414 --> 12:51.848
Get the hell out here!

12:58.825 --> 13:00.826
- Sorry, Fred.
- Sorry, old buddy.

13:00.828 --> 13:04.430
And, hey, if anyone asks,
you never saw us here, right?

13:04.432 --> 13:07.868
Can anyone say "serial killer"?

13:27.695 --> 13:28.427
Mom. Hey.

13:28.429 --> 13:29.762
Reminder to take your pills.

13:29.764 --> 13:31.465
- Yeah, I will.
- And feed the cat.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.601
- Yeah, I'll feed the cat.
- Lock the door.

13:33.603 --> 13:34.802
Mm-hmm.
- Love you.

13:34.804 --> 13:36.904
- Yeah. You, too.
- Okay. Bye.

13:36.906 --> 13:38.440
Bye.

13:47.418 --> 13:51.456
Damn it, moco.
Stupid cat.

14:23.497 --> 14:25.832
Maybe she's just not home.

14:25.834 --> 14:26.899
She's totally home.

14:26.901 --> 14:28.468
Where the hell else
would she be?

14:28.470 --> 14:29.671
She's just not answering.

14:29.673 --> 14:32.774
Annie!
I know you're home.

14:32.776 --> 14:36.212
It's Loren. Come on.
Let me in.

14:38.381 --> 14:41.418
Come on.
Maybe she's just asleep.

14:41.420 --> 14:42.253
Let's just go.

14:42.255 --> 14:46.458
If she's not back tomorrow,
we'll come back here, okay?

14:46.460 --> 14:49.494
Fine.

15:27.578 --> 15:31.014
- Loren! Steve! Help!
- So, what now?

15:31.016 --> 15:32.949
Scary movies at my place.

15:34.487 --> 15:36.420
Help!

15:55.078 --> 15:57.313
No!

16:19.743 --> 16:21.743
Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.

16:21.745 --> 16:24.413
Go! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

16:25.116 --> 16:26.917
Come on! Come on!
Keep going!

16:26.919 --> 16:28.785
Up! Up!

16:29.387 --> 16:32.056
Okay, girl.
Fix it.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.693
- Oh, got it!
- Good job, Loren.

16:34.695 --> 16:36.395
Pass it.

16:36.397 --> 16:38.064
Oh. Ow.

16:38.066 --> 16:39.498
Bitch, you did that on purpose!

16:39.500 --> 16:43.636
Language, Nora!

16:45.707 --> 16:47.977
Ow!

16:49.780 --> 16:51.814
Nora, uncalled for.

16:51.816 --> 16:52.816
And, Cheryl, watch it.

16:52.818 --> 16:55.819
Sorry, coach.
She's kind of hard to miss.

16:55.821 --> 16:57.388
I'm sorry.
What was that?

16:57.390 --> 16:59.791
Whoa!

16:59.793 --> 17:02.695
Deejay, wrong gym.
Dance is in the old gym.

17:02.697 --> 17:05.564
Go all the way down that hall.
Hang a left.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.465
Go all the way down.

17:06.468 --> 17:08.034
All right, ladies.
That's enough.

17:08.036 --> 17:12.507
We're finished for today.
Everyone hit the showers.

17:38.174 --> 17:39.941
Are you all right?

17:39.943 --> 17:40.875
Fine.

17:40.877 --> 17:44.513
I swear, one of these days,
I'm gonna beat Cheryl's ass.

17:44.515 --> 17:46.683
I want a front-row seat.

17:48.787 --> 17:51.722
God wasn't being fair
when he made me, was he?

17:51.724 --> 17:54.460
No way.
Me either, right?

17:54.462 --> 17:55.827
You're all right, Darcy.

17:55.829 --> 17:57.629
Maybe a little chubs these days.

17:57.631 --> 17:59.932
Of course, you're not half
as chubs as --

17:59.934 --> 18:02.936
stuff a pom-pom in it, Cheryl.

18:02.938 --> 18:04.872
So sweet cass finally returns

18:04.874 --> 18:07.575
to her repulsive roots
back in booville.

18:07.577 --> 18:10.011
Darcy, we're out.

18:10.013 --> 18:11.514
Move.

18:11.516 --> 18:13.850
Sorry about her.
What a bitch.

18:13.852 --> 18:17.055
No need.
It's not your drama.

18:17.057 --> 18:18.021
But, thanks.

18:18.023 --> 18:18.923
I tried telling Robby

18:18.925 --> 18:21.093
you weren't
a prancing spirit slut at heart.

18:21.095 --> 18:23.796
If anybody should be
apologizing, it should be me.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.967
I'm sorry you had
to tiptoe around that monster

18:26.969 --> 18:28.001
for the past three years.

18:28.003 --> 18:29.903
Well,
she'd actually been real sweet

18:29.905 --> 18:32.240
to everyone's face
until yesterday --

18:32.242 --> 18:34.209
the ballots for homecoming queen
came in,

18:34.211 --> 18:36.278
and she wasn't nominated.

18:37.982 --> 18:38.715
Boo-hoo.

18:38.717 --> 18:40.517
Look at us.
I miss this.

18:40.519 --> 18:42.853
I feel like I haven't seen
any of you in ages.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.153
Can you believe
we're actually seniors?

18:44.155 --> 18:46.891
I know. Insane.
But it's sad at the same time,

18:46.893 --> 18:48.627
because we all failed so hard
at being friends.

18:48.629 --> 18:50.529
We should make more of
an effort to get together then.

18:50.531 --> 18:52.599
- Steve would like that, too.
- What about Annie?

18:52.601 --> 18:53.800
- How is she?
- Oh, please.

18:53.802 --> 18:55.168
She wouldn't even return
your call

18:55.170 --> 18:56.204
if you were on your deathbed.

18:56.206 --> 18:57.938
She's the same
pretty much, up and down.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.074
Yeah, and I imagine the
remarkable return of homecoming

19:00.076 --> 19:01.609
has really helped
her healing process.

19:01.611 --> 19:02.745
Well, I don't blame her.

19:02.747 --> 19:04.714
I mean, I've been
a ball of nerves myself, too.

19:04.716 --> 19:08.118
I even puked
before school this morning.

19:14.594 --> 19:18.196
Jesus.
What the hell?

19:20.233 --> 19:21.968
"Happy homecoming"?

19:21.970 --> 19:23.170
Major creepage.

19:23.172 --> 19:26.641
I didn't realize
Steve was so morbidly romantic.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.010
He's not.

19:35.253 --> 19:36.219
Well, kids,

19:36.221 --> 19:38.356
I just don't know
what to make of this.

19:38.358 --> 19:40.091
Maybe some kind
of a practical joke.

19:40.093 --> 19:42.695
Who would play
a joke like this?

19:42.697 --> 19:44.029
You tell me, Steve.

19:44.031 --> 19:45.965
Maybe one
of the theater students?

19:45.967 --> 19:49.936
You guys were responsible for
the loss of half the costumes.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.038
Three years ago.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.840
Do you really think
some theater geek

19:52.842 --> 19:55.844
is still pissed at us
after all this time?

19:55.846 --> 19:56.845
Theater students

19:56.847 --> 19:59.182
have a flair for being dramatic,
don't they?

19:59.184 --> 20:01.951
Principal Patterson,
I don't think this is funny.

20:01.953 --> 20:03.187
Neither do I, wade.

20:03.189 --> 20:06.156
I'm just not quite sure yet
what to do about it.

20:06.158 --> 20:09.060
You can start
by calling the cops.

20:09.062 --> 20:12.798
Whoa, Jaclyn.
No need to do anything rash.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.900
No need to get
the police involved.

20:14.902 --> 20:18.206
Look, can you think of anyone

20:18.208 --> 20:21.076
who might have reason
to do this?

20:22.378 --> 20:23.112
All right.

20:23.114 --> 20:25.215
Until there's a reason
to think otherwise,

20:25.217 --> 20:27.217
we must assume
this is a practical joke.

20:27.219 --> 20:29.686
There's no evidence
these are actual threats.

20:29.688 --> 20:34.793
But I assure you, we will get
to the bottom of this, okay?

20:36.830 --> 20:39.732
Wait just a second.

20:39.734 --> 20:41.401
Where's Annie?

20:42.904 --> 20:45.205
Oh, yes.

20:45.207 --> 20:46.373
Annie Morgan.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.778
Maybe you should ask her why she
didn't get one in her locker.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.047
She could have.
She's not here today.

20:52.049 --> 20:55.951
Well, perhaps
we should check her locker then.

21:11.840 --> 21:15.277
There you have it --
no letter for Annie Morgan.

21:15.279 --> 21:17.079
What? No.
Annie wouldn't do this.

21:17.081 --> 21:19.749
We'll find out
when she's back in school.

21:19.751 --> 21:22.786
That said,
if I do hear of anything else,

21:22.788 --> 21:24.221
I will let you know.

21:24.223 --> 21:26.223
Otherwise,
I suggest the lot of you

21:26.225 --> 21:29.060
use your own two feet
and get back to class.

21:29.062 --> 21:32.732
We have homecoming
to prepare for, huh?

21:37.106 --> 21:39.873
What an asshole.
So, what now?

21:39.875 --> 21:41.977
You guys,
I'm totally freaking out now.

21:41.979 --> 21:44.079
I mean, do you really think
we're safe here?

21:44.081 --> 21:45.448
Of course we're safe, Cassie.

21:45.450 --> 21:46.850
I mean, safety in numbers,
right?

21:46.852 --> 21:48.384
Well, I know
I'll feel a lot safer

21:48.386 --> 21:50.120
if my man is patrolling
the dance floor tonight.

21:50.122 --> 21:52.156
Patterson said
not to call the police.

21:52.158 --> 21:54.158
Look, if I want
to call my man, I will.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.327
But, wait.
What about Annie?

21:55.329 --> 21:57.462
It is kind of weird
she didn't have a note.

21:57.464 --> 22:01.367
- I'll give her a call.
- Guys, come on.

22:01.369 --> 22:02.468
Just chill.

22:02.470 --> 22:03.470
Voicemail.

22:03.472 --> 22:06.106
Do you want to go check on her?

22:06.108 --> 22:07.342
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22:07.344 --> 22:10.145
We'll go check on her again,
all right?

22:10.147 --> 22:12.313
Did you try her house phone?

22:12.315 --> 22:13.849
I talked to her mom last week.

22:13.851 --> 22:14.918
They're in Florida all weekend.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.788
Everybody,
please just calm down.

22:17.790 --> 22:22.093
Like I said, we'll check on her
after school, okay?

22:22.095 --> 22:25.231
How about we all check on her?

22:25.233 --> 22:26.166
We can have a pre-party,

22:26.168 --> 22:29.270
ration out her mom's stash
of hooch and happy pills?

22:29.272 --> 22:31.972
That's not a bad idea.

22:31.974 --> 22:34.208
I mean, I wouldn't mind
seeing Annie myself.

22:34.210 --> 22:36.979
I haven't been the best
about checking in on her.

22:36.981 --> 22:39.248
I mean,
I don't want to overwhelm her,

22:39.250 --> 22:41.051
but a little reunion
might lift her spirits.

22:41.053 --> 22:43.821
- You think?
- It's worth a try.

22:43.823 --> 22:45.022
- I'm in.
- Me too.

22:45.024 --> 22:46.590
All right.
After class, then.

22:46.592 --> 22:48.159
Done deal.

22:48.161 --> 22:49.961
Go ahead.
I'm gonna go to the ladies'.

22:49.963 --> 22:53.065
- I'll see you in class.
- All right. See you soon.

23:16.463 --> 23:18.463
Come on, Annie. Pick up.

23:18.465 --> 23:21.101
<i>Hey, it's Annie.
Leave a message.</i>

23:35.920 --> 23:36.652
Jesus, Fred!

23:36.654 --> 23:40.023
Damn trash all over the floor.

23:40.025 --> 23:40.590
Sorry.

23:40.592 --> 23:43.095
Cleaning around here
sucks sometimes, huh?

23:43.097 --> 23:49.303
Yeah, you sure know
about that -- sucking.

23:59.117 --> 24:00.349
Wake up, Mr. Mathis.

24:00.351 --> 24:03.387
We stopped giving naps
after kindergarten.

24:04.123 --> 24:08.426
I'd hate to see
you miss graduation...Again.

24:10.130 --> 24:11.430
You're late, Loren.

24:11.432 --> 24:12.598
Sorry, Mrs. Patterson.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.000
I'm sure you are.

24:15.002 --> 24:16.568
Everyone, open to page 32

24:16.570 --> 24:20.573
of aphra behn's "oroonoko"
for discussion.

24:20.575 --> 24:23.312
Hey.

24:23.314 --> 24:26.415
I think I know who put
those letters in the lockers.

24:26.417 --> 24:28.250
Who?

24:31.589 --> 24:32.589
Really?

24:32.591 --> 24:34.025
I know he did.

24:34.027 --> 24:36.361
He's still pissed at us
about Billy.

24:36.363 --> 24:37.129
Karl told me.

24:37.131 --> 24:40.232
But how would
he have gotten into our lockers?

24:40.234 --> 24:41.201
I don't know.

24:41.203 --> 24:44.571
But he gets to school early
for extra football practice,

24:44.573 --> 24:46.740
so he has time to do it.

24:46.742 --> 24:48.409
It makes sense.

24:48.411 --> 24:52.181
That slimy little --

24:52.183 --> 24:54.984
little what, Jaclyn?

24:54.986 --> 24:57.119
Uh...Um,
nothing, Mrs. Patterson.

24:57.121 --> 25:00.991
Making reference
to the lilliputians, are we?

25:00.993 --> 25:03.495
Um, no, Mrs. Patterson.

25:03.497 --> 25:05.630
Perhaps
you'd like to give your thoughts

25:05.632 --> 25:08.100
on the narrative position
of "oroonoko"?

25:08.102 --> 25:13.107
Oh, uh, the narrator
inherits her stature

25:13.109 --> 25:15.243
from her ancestors
without choice.

25:15.245 --> 25:17.213
Behn doesn't want to
discriminate against oroonoko,

25:17.215 --> 25:20.783
because she knows he's her
equal, even though he's a slave.

25:20.785 --> 25:26.423
Behn has to stay in her place
to keep the status quo.

25:27.292 --> 25:30.528
Well put, Loren.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.464
Now, can anyone think

25:32.466 --> 25:36.169
of modern-day parallels
to this view?

25:36.537 --> 25:42.810
Well, high school is one
with a plethora of viewpoints

25:42.812 --> 25:45.580
from ethnicity, to gender,

25:45.582 --> 25:49.051
to something as intimate
as who we fall in love with.

25:49.053 --> 25:56.194
In "oroonoko," behn unveils
that it is within our nature

25:56.196 --> 25:57.596
to set boundaries on ourselves,

25:57.598 --> 26:01.535
because they ultimately
help us survive.

26:05.374 --> 26:07.475
- Yo.
- Any word from Annie?

26:07.477 --> 26:08.242
Mnh-mnh.

26:08.244 --> 26:11.179
So why did you look so
spooked when you got to class?

26:11.181 --> 26:13.383
Oh, nothing.
Fred startled me.

26:13.385 --> 26:15.452
Ew.
That pervy janitor.

26:15.454 --> 26:16.853
Custodial engineer.

26:16.855 --> 26:19.089
Wait.
Did he touch you?

26:19.091 --> 26:20.391
No, Steve.
He just startled me.

26:20.393 --> 26:23.628
Steve, don't be a hater.
Fred's a goody-goody.

26:23.630 --> 26:24.829
Wait.
What do you mean?

26:24.831 --> 26:28.234
Apparently,
he's a volunteer firefighter

26:28.236 --> 26:29.134
on the weekends.

26:29.136 --> 26:30.336
I saw his getup
in the custodian closet.

26:30.338 --> 26:33.474
What were you doing
in the custodian closet?

26:33.476 --> 26:37.245
Oh, I was
doing...Robby...In there...

26:37.247 --> 26:40.149
While you dweebs
were hall-decorating.

26:40.151 --> 26:41.485
Uh, gross.
Thanks for that image.

26:41.487 --> 26:43.219
Loren,
have you heard from Annie?

26:43.221 --> 26:45.490
She's been absent from class
the last couple of days.

26:45.492 --> 26:46.790
I-I haven't heard from her.

26:46.792 --> 26:49.193
We were actually just
about to check on her, Mrs. "p."

26:49.195 --> 26:51.864
Oh, well, I --
well, I hope she's okay.

26:51.866 --> 26:53.867
Um, see you
at the dance tonight?

26:53.869 --> 26:54.666
Okay.

26:54.668 --> 26:56.769
Derrick, your book report.

26:56.771 --> 26:59.339
Worst...Class...Ever.

27:01.277 --> 27:03.177
You guys
did a great job last week

27:03.179 --> 27:04.212
on our "go, cats, go!" Cheer,

27:04.214 --> 27:05.614
so we're gonna save that
for after half time,

27:05.616 --> 27:09.251
and we're gonna open the game
with our uca competition dance.

27:09.253 --> 27:12.455
So everybody please
make sure you stretch before --

27:12.457 --> 27:14.491
Cheryl, are you listening?

27:14.493 --> 27:16.326
Competition dance.
Stretch.

27:16.328 --> 27:17.930
Anything else, Captain bore?

27:17.932 --> 27:21.935
Fine. We'll meet
on the fields at 6:30 sharp.

27:21.937 --> 27:24.604
Go, wildcats!

27:24.606 --> 27:25.673
Hey.

27:25.675 --> 27:27.207
Watch out for him, Cheryl.

27:27.209 --> 27:28.209
He's bad news.

27:28.211 --> 27:29.277
Don't be jealous...

27:29.279 --> 27:31.245
Just 'cause
you couldn't keep him.

27:31.247 --> 27:31.880
Keep him?

27:31.882 --> 27:33.950
I dumped him after two months.
He was such a jerk.

27:33.952 --> 27:36.953
Well, isn't that the pot
calling the kettle back?

27:36.955 --> 27:38.454
It's black, Darcy.

27:38.456 --> 27:40.591
It's calling the kettle black.

27:40.593 --> 27:42.760
Um, that's racist.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.362
Shut up.

27:44.364 --> 27:46.298
May I have
a word with you, Cassie?

27:46.300 --> 27:49.267
Sure.
Is this about the letters?

27:49.269 --> 27:50.703
Did you find out who did it?

27:50.705 --> 27:52.872
Actually, no.

27:52.874 --> 27:54.808
This is about the dance tonight.

27:54.810 --> 27:57.745
I was hoping that you might
come by my office later

27:57.747 --> 28:01.550
so that we might be able
to discuss your crowning.

28:01.552 --> 28:03.787
What?
I made queen?!

28:03.789 --> 28:04.654
Shh.

28:04.656 --> 28:07.457
Principal Patterson,
I don't think anyone's supposed

28:07.459 --> 28:09.427
to know the homecoming queen
until the dance.

28:09.429 --> 28:10.529
Come on, Cassie.

28:10.531 --> 28:12.731
Both you and I know
you're a shoo-in for queen.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.000
And I was thinking
it would be nice

28:14.002 --> 28:17.270
if we could, uh,
prearrange the...

28:17.272 --> 28:21.575
The coronation of this year's
queen properly, you know --

28:21.577 --> 28:22.476
back in my office?

28:22.478 --> 28:26.348
Oh, um,
principal Patterson, I'm sorry.

28:26.350 --> 28:29.618
It's just I already have plans
after school,

28:29.620 --> 28:30.953
but I am so excited.

28:30.955 --> 28:32.389
And thank you so much.

28:32.391 --> 28:33.656
I won't tell anybody.

28:33.658 --> 28:34.758
Oh, look.
There's my ride.

28:34.760 --> 28:37.494
I got to run.
See you at the game.

28:41.334 --> 28:41.901
Ugh.

28:41.903 --> 28:44.271
Ugh.
Patterson is a major perv.

28:44.273 --> 28:45.272
I think he just hit on me.

28:45.274 --> 28:46.440
- Serious?
- Shut up.

28:46.442 --> 28:47.607
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

28:47.609 --> 28:49.277
I want you to do something fun
with my hair

28:49.279 --> 28:50.512
that will look good
under a tiara.

28:50.514 --> 28:52.547
Oh. So sure
we're winning the crown, are we?

28:52.549 --> 28:56.586
Hello?
I'm a total shoo-in.

28:56.588 --> 28:58.721
Hey, guys.
Are we all ready?

28:58.723 --> 28:59.923
Yes.
And I know where her dad

28:59.925 --> 29:02.293
keeps enough whiskey
to put down an elephant.

29:02.295 --> 29:04.863
See?
This is gonna be fun.

29:04.865 --> 29:07.666
Yeah, it'll be fun.

29:17.345 --> 29:19.480
Sheriff Corbin.

29:19.482 --> 29:20.449
Yes?

29:20.451 --> 29:21.749
And what brings you by?

29:21.751 --> 29:25.388
Cut the crap,
Patterson. I'm here on business.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.692
My deputy got wind
that some of the students

29:27.694 --> 29:30.028
got some death threats
in their lockers.

29:30.030 --> 29:31.029
Your deputy?

29:31.031 --> 29:32.998
Yeah.
Karl clements.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.534
Jaclyn's boyfriend.

29:35.536 --> 29:39.505
She and a few of her friends
found these.

29:41.576 --> 29:43.444
These friends...

29:43.446 --> 29:46.082
Are they the same kids
that killed my boy?

29:46.084 --> 29:48.951
Don't you think that's something
I ought to know about?

29:48.953 --> 29:52.756
Sheriff...
Billy was a hell of a kid

29:52.758 --> 29:55.592
and probably would have been
the best damn quarterback

29:55.594 --> 29:57.861
this town has seen in 15 years.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.731
We were all broken up about it.

29:59.733 --> 30:02.901
And if I could have expelled
those students permanently,

30:02.903 --> 30:03.736
I would have.

30:03.738 --> 30:04.803
Look, Patterson,

30:04.805 --> 30:07.108
I don't want to hear
about your failed-ass attempts.

30:07.110 --> 30:08.609
Those kids
are the reason my wife

30:08.611 --> 30:11.079
has spent the last three years
in the nuthouse.

30:11.081 --> 30:15.118
She barely eats, sleeps,
or says two words.

30:15.120 --> 30:18.422
I feel for you, sheriff.

30:18.424 --> 30:20.624
I'm not sure
what it is you want me to do.

30:20.626 --> 30:22.826
I don't want you to do anything.

30:22.828 --> 30:23.927
But I want something I can use

30:23.929 --> 30:25.730
to take action
against those kids.

30:25.732 --> 30:27.799
Well, those kids
didn't just simply plant

30:27.801 --> 30:29.602
those notes in their lockers
themselves,

30:29.604 --> 30:32.172
and I can't go around
accusing my students

30:32.174 --> 30:33.140
without some sort of --

30:33.142 --> 30:34.608
well, that's fine.

30:34.610 --> 30:38.813
You just sit here in your cozy
little office and play innocent.

30:38.815 --> 30:43.786
But if you're not gonna do
anything about them, I will.

31:05.014 --> 31:05.914
Man, you guys.

31:05.916 --> 31:07.715
We don't want to scare
the royal poop out of her.

31:07.717 --> 31:09.919
- Shut up, Robby.
- Maybe she's not home.

31:09.921 --> 31:11.487
Oh, she's home.

31:11.489 --> 31:13.790
She may be on cloud Xanax,
but she's home.

31:13.792 --> 31:15.992
We may have to find
another liquor stash to loot.

31:15.994 --> 31:19.096
Nah.
Maybe the back's open.

31:22.535 --> 31:24.637
Anyone inside there?

31:24.639 --> 31:26.906
Nada.

31:26.908 --> 31:28.609
Wade, what are you doing?

31:28.611 --> 31:31.813
What's the big deal?
It's open already.

31:31.815 --> 31:34.584
- Hey, Annie!
- Sweet!

31:34.586 --> 31:35.585
Everyone's here!

31:35.587 --> 31:37.086
Get your lovely lady lumps
down here

31:37.088 --> 31:38.989
so we can have a drink!

31:40.023 --> 31:41.925
I don't think Annie's here.

31:41.927 --> 31:44.127
Hey, guys.
What are you guys doing?

31:44.129 --> 31:47.098
The good stuff's in the garage.

31:50.671 --> 31:54.774
Hey.
She skipped for a reason.

31:54.776 --> 31:56.644
Maybe she just wants
to be left alone.

31:56.646 --> 31:59.580
All right. Well, let me
just at least check on her

31:59.582 --> 32:00.949
to see if she's all right.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.759
I got a text from Annie.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.932
I can't even find the light.

32:13.934 --> 32:16.168
What does it say?

32:16.170 --> 32:18.237
"Leave me alone."

32:18.239 --> 32:21.742
See?
What did I say.

32:23.745 --> 32:25.213
Jaclyn, forget it.

32:25.215 --> 32:27.782
We're leaving.

32:27.784 --> 32:30.620
Damn. Really?

32:30.622 --> 32:31.687
Come on, guys.

32:31.689 --> 32:34.157
We still love you, Annie bear!

32:34.159 --> 32:37.662
If you change your mind,
give us a call!

32:41.668 --> 32:43.001
Now what?

32:43.003 --> 32:44.671
I have an idea.

32:44.673 --> 32:47.106
As class president,
guess what I have.

32:47.108 --> 32:49.742
Keys to the teachers' lounge.

32:49.744 --> 32:50.276
Yes!

32:50.278 --> 32:51.946
The game starts in two hours,

32:51.948 --> 32:52.980
and I say we meet up there

32:52.982 --> 32:55.217
after it starts for
a quick break before the dance.

32:55.219 --> 32:58.689
And by break, I mean
booze break.

32:58.691 --> 33:02.727
'Cause I know where my dad keeps
his stash of vodka in the study.

33:02.729 --> 33:04.996
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

33:04.998 --> 33:07.032
That's what I'm talking about.

33:07.034 --> 33:09.335
Yep. See you.

33:13.874 --> 33:14.775
You all right?

33:14.777 --> 33:17.244
I don't know.
That just isn't like Annie.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.714
We knew this weekend
would be hard on her.

33:19.716 --> 33:22.350
Just give her some space,
all right?

33:22.352 --> 33:23.318
You're a good friend,

33:23.320 --> 33:25.722
and that's all you can be
right now, okay?

33:25.724 --> 33:26.889
Yeah.
You're right.

33:26.891 --> 33:29.259
All right.
Let's go.

33:43.779 --> 33:44.846
What are those?

33:44.848 --> 33:47.116
Oh, some prankster

33:47.118 --> 33:48.784
put them in the lockers
of all those kids

33:48.786 --> 33:50.787
responsible
for that Billy Corbin mess.

33:50.789 --> 33:53.790
Mess?
Dan, we lost a student.

33:53.792 --> 33:54.692
I know.

33:54.694 --> 33:59.130
And it's been a real mess I've
had to deal with ever since.

33:59.132 --> 34:01.833
You've no idea
how much money this school lost,

34:01.835 --> 34:03.969
not only
in property-code violations,

34:03.971 --> 34:06.205
but also
in losing that Corbin kid, too.

34:06.207 --> 34:08.041
He had the best damn arm
in the state.

34:08.043 --> 34:10.043
I heard
his Father stopped by today.

34:10.045 --> 34:12.346
He got wind of those notes.

34:12.348 --> 34:13.813
Do they know who did it?

34:13.815 --> 34:16.317
He thinks
one of those kids did it.

34:16.319 --> 34:17.853
I can't say I blame him.

34:17.855 --> 34:19.956
They ruined this town
and got away

34:19.958 --> 34:22.793
without so much as a scratch.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.362
Well...

34:24.364 --> 34:26.330
It's in the past.

34:26.331 --> 34:27.299
What's done is done.

34:27.301 --> 34:30.268
We just...Have to let it go,
right?

34:30.271 --> 34:32.772
Try telling that to Corbin.

34:32.774 --> 34:34.875
He thinks all this
is gonna send his wife

34:34.877 --> 34:36.744
screaming back to the nuthouse.

34:36.746 --> 34:38.279
Hell.

34:38.281 --> 34:41.949
Probably better than living
with that nightmare of a man.

34:41.952 --> 34:43.485
Dan.

34:43.487 --> 34:45.855
That's a terrible thing to say.

34:45.857 --> 34:47.356
Poor Vivian.

34:49.261 --> 34:51.328
I mean, she lost a son.

34:51.330 --> 34:54.231
I can only imagine
what it's like to lose a child.

34:54.233 --> 34:56.802
Since you
were never able to have them,

34:56.804 --> 34:59.038
that sounds about right.

35:06.082 --> 35:08.117
What?

35:08.284 --> 35:13.223
Everybody has got to be
so damn dramatic.

35:27.876 --> 35:28.374
Hey.

35:28.376 --> 35:31.779
Hey. I'm headed
over to the field now.

35:31.781 --> 35:32.780
Can you come meet me there?

35:32.782 --> 35:34.548
I can't right now.

35:34.550 --> 35:35.350
I'm working.

35:35.352 --> 35:37.219
You told me
you were patrolling

35:37.221 --> 35:38.888
the school grounds tonight.

35:38.890 --> 35:39.555
And I am.

35:39.557 --> 35:41.057
But the sheriff is Mia
at the moment,

35:41.059 --> 35:44.228
so I've got some other things
that I need to get done first.

35:44.230 --> 35:46.030
So, what?
You're just gonna have me walk

35:46.032 --> 35:49.201
through that parking lot
all by myself in the dark,

35:49.203 --> 35:50.569
after Annie not showing up today

35:50.571 --> 35:53.139
and those creepy notes
in our lockers?

35:53.141 --> 35:56.142
I promise you, I will
come find you at the dance

35:56.144 --> 35:58.112
- once I'm finished.
- Karl,

35:58.114 --> 36:01.283
what could possibly be
more important than me?

36:01.285 --> 36:02.851
Listen, I got to go.

36:02.853 --> 36:04.419
I'm scared.

36:04.421 --> 36:05.454
I need you here with me.

36:05.456 --> 36:09.593
All right. Call Loren,
have her walk you to the field.

36:09.595 --> 36:10.893
Karl!

36:43.438 --> 36:47.074
Hurrah, and hello,
and welcome to Winston stadium,

36:47.076 --> 36:48.474
all you wild wildcat fans.

36:48.476 --> 36:53.314
Tonight, for one night only,
not only are we celebrating

36:53.316 --> 36:55.550
Winston's annual
homecoming festivities,

36:55.552 --> 36:59.421
but we're also taking on
our long-running rivals,

36:59.423 --> 37:01.658
the maddington mustangs.

37:01.660 --> 37:02.625
What are we gonna do?

37:02.627 --> 37:07.266
Ride...The...Mustangs!

37:10.570 --> 37:13.473
You look so beautiful.

37:13.475 --> 37:17.010
Thanks, but I'm really
not feeling it tonight.

37:17.012 --> 37:18.612
Hey.
Where's Jaclyn?

37:18.614 --> 37:19.981
Is she supposed to meet us here?

37:19.983 --> 37:21.549
Uh, she had to drop
by the drugstore

37:21.551 --> 37:23.452
and then meet Karl
before his shift started.

37:23.454 --> 37:25.321
He's gonna patrol
the dance tonight.

37:25.323 --> 37:27.056
Someone to keep us safe --

37:27.058 --> 37:28.591
that's a good thing, right?

37:28.593 --> 37:29.326
Yeah.

37:29.328 --> 37:32.629
Hey, if you don't want
to do this, we don't have to.

37:32.631 --> 37:36.234
We could go pull a Nora-Robby.
Maybe go to a --

37:36.236 --> 37:38.937
- no. Let's go.
- Okay.

37:38.939 --> 37:41.608
I need to get my mind
off Annie anyway.

37:41.610 --> 37:43.643
- I'm fine.
Mm-hmm.

37:43.645 --> 37:44.945
Knowing Nora and Robby,

37:44.947 --> 37:46.680
they probably won't even show up
to the dance anyway.

37:46.682 --> 37:49.485
God only knows with those two.

37:49.487 --> 37:50.686
Yeah.

37:50.688 --> 37:51.454
Forget it.

37:51.456 --> 37:53.623
I'm totally not going
to the field.

37:53.625 --> 37:55.426
Football is a barbaric sport,
and...

37:55.428 --> 37:57.328
I don't care
anything about it.

37:57.330 --> 37:59.698
We can meet up with everyone
at the dance.

37:59.700 --> 38:02.133
Fine.

38:02.135 --> 38:05.404
So, what do you want to do
till then?

38:06.106 --> 38:09.409
Is sex all you ever think about?

38:10.679 --> 38:12.980
Well, we sure as shit
can't do it in this heap.

38:12.982 --> 38:14.515
There's not enough room.

38:15.752 --> 38:18.387
I've got an idea.

38:22.527 --> 38:24.728
Good lord.

38:24.730 --> 38:27.365
I think I've died
and seen my first angel.

38:27.367 --> 38:29.033
You mean your first queen?

38:29.035 --> 38:32.271
By the way,
I did that queen's hair.

38:32.273 --> 38:36.143
Shouldn't you be down
there cheering with your squad?

38:36.145 --> 38:38.345
Queen nominee --
I get the night off.

38:38.347 --> 38:39.213
Well, then...

38:39.215 --> 38:41.248
Come have a seat here,
your majesty,

38:41.250 --> 38:46.055
because this just so happens to
be the best seat in the house...

38:46.057 --> 38:47.391
Right next to me.

38:57.169 --> 39:00.606
Karl, where are you?

39:13.691 --> 39:14.557
What are you doing?

39:14.559 --> 39:16.160
Making sure no one is coming.

39:16.162 --> 39:17.761
Exactly.
No one is coming.

39:17.763 --> 39:19.798
So get down here.

39:23.804 --> 39:25.805
Nora.

39:25.807 --> 39:27.507
Nora, I love you so.

39:27.509 --> 39:31.278
Will you please be
a little more quiet?

39:36.718 --> 39:40.089
Touchdown!

39:41.391 --> 39:44.661
Marry me.
Marry me, Nora.

39:44.663 --> 39:45.261
Ow!

39:45.263 --> 39:47.665
Aw, you're such an idiot, Robby!

39:47.667 --> 39:48.466
What?

39:48.468 --> 39:51.435
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

39:51.437 --> 39:52.170
Is that so bad?

39:52.172 --> 39:53.438
It is once we finish screwing

39:53.440 --> 39:56.810
in the back
of Allen Mathis' pickup truck.

39:56.812 --> 39:58.679
I swear, men just don't get it.

39:58.681 --> 40:01.149
What?
What don't I get?

40:01.151 --> 40:02.450
I love you.
What else is there to get?

40:02.452 --> 40:03.752
Robby, if you don't shut it

40:03.754 --> 40:06.422
and let me smoke this cigarette
in peace a minute

40:06.424 --> 40:07.156
so I can think,

40:07.158 --> 40:11.128
I swear I've got a backhand with
your name written all over it.

40:12.264 --> 40:15.399
Look, Nora.
I won't shut up.

40:15.401 --> 40:16.767
I want you to tell me.

40:16.769 --> 40:17.636
Say what?

40:17.638 --> 40:20.339
I want you to say you love me.

40:20.341 --> 40:23.877
I say it all the time,
and you never once -- aah!

42:34.609 --> 42:36.509
Robby.

42:37.444 --> 42:38.812
I'm sorry.

42:38.814 --> 42:41.081
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:41.083 --> 42:43.818
I love you.
I do.

42:43.820 --> 42:45.821
Aah!

43:02.943 --> 43:05.712
- Loren.

43:05.714 --> 43:06.880
Jaclyn.
It's okay.

43:06.882 --> 43:08.350
What's wrong?
What happened?

43:08.352 --> 43:10.885
Karl --
he was supposed to meet me here,

43:10.887 --> 43:11.886
but he didn't show up.

43:11.888 --> 43:14.022
But he's working, right?

43:14.024 --> 43:15.724
Maybe he's, uh...

43:15.726 --> 43:18.095
I sent him a text, Loren,

43:18.097 --> 43:20.664
and he didn't even show up.

43:20.666 --> 43:22.567
Come on.
Let's go.

43:22.569 --> 43:23.734
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

43:23.736 --> 43:25.637
The kids will be headed
there from this field soon,

43:25.639 --> 43:28.975
so we'll meet you at the sweep
center in 20 minutes. Copy?

43:28.977 --> 43:31.511
I've got it under control.
Over.

43:31.513 --> 43:33.080
The sheriff's still Mia, Karl.

43:33.082 --> 43:34.782
You'd better stay
on your game tonight.

43:34.784 --> 43:37.152
Copy that, loud and clear.

43:37.154 --> 43:40.790
Well...Let's go for round one.

43:40.792 --> 43:42.558
Ding.

43:51.404 --> 43:55.074
No, I'm not gonna miss
my senior homecoming

43:55.076 --> 43:57.610
just because my boyfriend
is such a...

43:57.612 --> 43:58.412
Twatface?

43:58.414 --> 43:59.679
Yeah.
Thanks, Steve.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.715
Hey, we're gonna
get through this, okay?

44:01.717 --> 44:03.917
Look at me.
I'm such a hot mess.

44:03.919 --> 44:06.588
I got to look better if
I'm gonna find a new man, huh?

44:06.590 --> 44:10.160
That's my girl.

44:18.704 --> 44:21.574
Hey, hey, party people!

44:21.576 --> 44:23.009
Hey.

44:23.011 --> 44:24.645
What's up with that balloon?

44:24.647 --> 44:27.614
I made it
for the senior class and myself

44:27.616 --> 44:29.583
for winning
this year's hall decorations.

44:29.585 --> 44:31.886
So you made yourself a balloon?

44:32.689 --> 44:34.055
Well, somebody
stole the spirit Baton.

44:34.057 --> 44:37.493
What was I supposed to do --
go unrewarded?

44:38.196 --> 44:41.164
Hey, where is, uh,
Robby and Nora?

44:41.166 --> 44:43.800
Probably somewhere
on their backs.

44:45.838 --> 44:48.574
But, hey, how about that game,
huh, guys?

44:48.576 --> 44:53.647
32-16.
Go, wildcats!

44:53.649 --> 44:54.915
Aww, babe.
Nice try.

44:54.917 --> 44:56.518
Tough crowd, tough crowd.

44:56.520 --> 44:59.221
Okay. Well, we're gonna have
to cheers to something.

44:59.223 --> 45:02.592
How about to, uh, old friends?

45:02.594 --> 45:04.026
And new beginnings.

45:04.028 --> 45:06.062
To our last homecoming.

45:06.064 --> 45:08.500
And surviving the night.

45:08.502 --> 45:11.202
Whoo! Cheers.

45:11.204 --> 45:12.971

You wouldn't let me play, coach.

46:06.740 --> 46:07.972
Why should I dress up?

46:07.974 --> 46:09.274
You get your damn grades up,

46:09.276 --> 46:11.044
and I'll get you
back on the damn field.

46:11.046 --> 46:15.983
Until then, you show up and
support your team, understood?

46:15.985 --> 46:18.721
Yeah.
Well, whatever.

46:24.329 --> 46:26.295
What can I get for you, Larry?

46:26.297 --> 46:28.098
A smile would be nice.

46:28.100 --> 46:30.000
Fat chance.

46:30.002 --> 46:32.370
Now, how is that
to treat an old lover?

46:32.372 --> 46:33.738
Old lover?

46:33.740 --> 46:36.208
I would hardly call
a drunken one-night stand

46:36.210 --> 46:39.379
anything other than
a momentary lapse of judgment.

46:39.381 --> 46:42.617
Why?
You don't like me anymore?

46:42.619 --> 46:44.385
No. I don't.

46:45.288 --> 46:46.688
In fact, I never really did.

46:46.690 --> 46:50.058
My philosophy is,
if I could have you once,

46:50.060 --> 46:51.227
I can have you again.

46:51.229 --> 46:53.630
Well, my philosophy

46:53.632 --> 46:57.802
is that, if you don't get out
of my personal space right now,

46:57.804 --> 47:00.205
that I'm gonna shove that ladle
so far up your ass

47:00.207 --> 47:02.908
you're gonna be blowing punch
out of your nose

47:02.910 --> 47:03.876
until next homecoming.

47:03.878 --> 47:06.647

Otherwise, stay out of sight.
You spook the kids.

47:43.361 --> 47:47.864
Uh, yeah.
I got to tell you, principal.

47:47.866 --> 47:50.368
Some of them --
some of them kids got in,

47:50.370 --> 47:54.472
and they taped tampons all over
the freshmen hall decorations.

47:54.474 --> 47:59.312
Well, then get
in there and take them down.

47:59.314 --> 48:01.449
Oh.

48:08.057 --> 48:08.924
Cassie,

48:08.926 --> 48:11.427
we need all the nominees
backstage, dear.

48:11.429 --> 48:12.794
Wade, we need you, too.

48:12.796 --> 48:15.132
All right, guys.
Wish me luck.

48:15.134 --> 48:16.967
Good luck.

48:17.368 --> 48:19.205
Do you think she'll win?

48:19.207 --> 48:22.775
Come on.
She's a shoo-in.

48:30.385 --> 48:31.285
Are you okay?

48:31.287 --> 48:34.056
- What's wrong?

48:34.058 --> 48:35.758
Don't worry about all of this.

48:35.760 --> 48:36.792
It doesn't really matter.

48:36.794 --> 48:40.363
Even if you don't win,
you're still my queen.

48:40.365 --> 48:45.036
I know, but this is
so important to me, you know?

48:45.038 --> 48:47.139
I mean, this is
probably the best thing

48:47.141 --> 48:48.507
that will ever happen to me.

48:48.509 --> 48:50.542
Honey, honey, honey, whoa.

48:50.544 --> 48:51.377
Hold on a second.

48:51.379 --> 48:53.379
The best thing
that ever happened to you?

48:53.381 --> 48:55.449
See, that's crazy.

48:55.451 --> 48:58.152
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

48:58.154 --> 49:00.921
You're gonna graduate
and go to college

49:00.923 --> 49:02.825
and get out of this dumpy town.

49:02.827 --> 49:06.396
No, wade.
I won't.

49:06.398 --> 49:08.265
Mom's malignant.

49:08.267 --> 49:10.835
She has six months, tops.

49:10.837 --> 49:13.372
And besides, someone has to stay
and take care of grams.

49:13.374 --> 49:17.043
With my piece-of-shit dad gone,
there's no one else.

49:17.045 --> 49:18.477
Cassie, I think your mom

49:18.479 --> 49:20.079
would still want you
to go to college

49:20.081 --> 49:21.448
and make a life for yourself.

49:21.450 --> 49:23.184
She does.

49:23.186 --> 49:25.820
But she won't even be here
in six months.

49:25.822 --> 49:27.322
So it doesn't matter.

49:29.127 --> 49:30.458
But it's not so bad, right?

49:30.460 --> 49:31.494
I mean, you're gonna stay

49:31.496 --> 49:34.397
and open Winston's first salon
and spa anyway, right?

49:34.399 --> 49:35.833
- So we can --
but, Cassie,

49:35.835 --> 49:37.534
that's only
because my folks are loaded

49:37.536 --> 49:39.404
and I can afford
that kind of luxury.

49:39.406 --> 49:45.212
Yeah. Well, I can't,
and neither can my grandma.

49:45.214 --> 49:47.181
Yes.

49:47.183 --> 49:48.515
Yes, you can.

49:48.517 --> 49:51.086
Do you want to know why?

49:51.088 --> 49:53.889
Because I'm gonna be here
to take care of old grams.

49:53.891 --> 49:55.991
What?
Wade, that's ridiculous.

49:55.993 --> 49:57.994
No.
No, it's not.

49:57.996 --> 49:58.628
I love your grams.

49:58.630 --> 50:00.630
Besides, you're gonna be
like two hours away.

50:00.632 --> 50:02.266
You can come and visit
on the weekends.

50:02.268 --> 50:04.635
Wade, I can't ask you to.

50:04.637 --> 50:07.037
Cassie, you didn't.

50:08.208 --> 50:11.644
Wade, it's time, dear.

50:13.881 --> 50:16.450
We'll talk more
about this later, okay?

50:16.452 --> 50:18.185
For now, wipe away those tears.

50:18.187 --> 50:20.054
You're ruining your mascara.

50:24.127 --> 50:27.164
Attention, everyone.

50:27.166 --> 50:31.303
May I have your attention,
please?

50:31.305 --> 50:35.540
And welcome to Winston high's
first homecoming dance

50:35.542 --> 50:36.675
in three years.

50:41.516 --> 50:46.054
And now that special moment
you've all been waiting for.

50:46.056 --> 50:49.124
Let's bring out the nominees.

50:51.194 --> 50:52.261
Whoo, whoo!

50:52.263 --> 50:55.432
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

50:56.467 --> 50:57.968
And here to announce

50:57.970 --> 51:00.971
this year's
homecoming king and queen,

51:00.973 --> 51:04.443
student-body president
wade Scott.

51:10.252 --> 51:12.386
This is stupid.

51:12.388 --> 51:14.456
Classic.

51:14.458 --> 51:15.458
Thank you, principal Patterson.

51:15.460 --> 51:21.197
And now, without further ado,
I give you this year's king cat.

51:22.335 --> 51:24.635
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

51:26.706 --> 51:28.473
Um, this is interesting.

51:28.475 --> 51:30.042
I think
this might be the first time

51:30.044 --> 51:32.044
that we've ever rewarded
a student

51:32.046 --> 51:34.080
for being a senior twice.

51:34.649 --> 51:37.050
On his second go-around
as a Winston senior,

51:37.052 --> 51:41.055
your homecoming king,
Allen Mathis.

51:47.765 --> 51:52.104
And now for the real moment
you've all been waiting for.

51:55.208 --> 51:57.209
Time to crown the biggest whore.

51:57.211 --> 51:58.244
Cheryl,

51:58.246 --> 52:00.146
you weren't even nominated.

52:03.418 --> 52:05.119
Oh.
Go ahead, girlfriend.

52:05.121 --> 52:06.554
'Cause after the day
that I've had,

52:06.556 --> 52:10.725
I would love for somebody
to throw the first punch.

52:11.562 --> 52:15.231
First, I would like
to take this moment

52:15.233 --> 52:18.402
to say that this year's
homecoming queen

52:18.404 --> 52:19.403
is an exemplary form

52:19.405 --> 52:22.507
of character, beauty,
and intelligence.

52:22.509 --> 52:26.779
Her ambition is gonna bring
her far beyond this fair town

52:26.781 --> 52:29.716
and to a destiny
beyond which, well...

52:29.718 --> 52:31.217
There will be no limits.

52:31.219 --> 52:35.290
I give your queen,
Cassie Herron.

52:46.439 --> 52:50.276
Thank you so much,
Winston high.

52:54.415 --> 52:57.284
You are a God among men,
wade Scott.

52:57.286 --> 52:59.553
If you were straight, I'd snatch
you up in a heartbeat.

52:59.555 --> 53:01.322
Whoa. Wait.
How did you know?

53:01.324 --> 53:03.725
Wade, I've known you
since kindergarten.

53:03.727 --> 53:04.760
I think I know you pretty well.

53:04.762 --> 53:06.728
Point taken.

53:06.730 --> 53:07.697
But I do have a secret

53:07.699 --> 53:09.531
- that I bet you don't know.
- Yeah?

53:09.533 --> 53:12.369
I'm actually
kind of seeing someone.

53:12.371 --> 53:14.406
Shut the shit up.
Who?

53:14.408 --> 53:16.708
Um...

53:18.378 --> 53:20.147
Really?
Press-box boy?

53:20.149 --> 53:21.414
But Chris Masterson is so...

53:21.416 --> 53:23.183
Butch?
I know, right?

53:23.185 --> 53:23.818
Good job.

53:23.820 --> 53:26.321
I believe this calls
for a celebration.

53:26.323 --> 53:27.455
Indeed.

53:27.457 --> 53:28.723
Uh...Shit.

53:28.725 --> 53:31.127
I, uh, left the vodka
in the teachers' lounge.

53:31.129 --> 53:32.561
It's okay.
We don't need it.

53:32.563 --> 53:34.464
Are you kidding me?
I can't just leave it in there.

53:34.466 --> 53:36.299
Well, then let's go get it.

53:36.301 --> 53:37.200
No, no, no.

53:37.202 --> 53:39.837
You stay here and enjoy
your palace and the peasants.

53:39.839 --> 53:43.508
And I'll be right back, okay?

53:58.529 --> 54:00.796
Would you mind
taking over for me?

54:00.798 --> 54:01.531
Sure.

54:01.533 --> 54:03.400
I need to head
to the ladies' room.

54:03.402 --> 54:05.669
Mm.
Russell, you all right?

54:05.671 --> 54:08.640
Yeah.
I'm fine.

54:17.652 --> 54:19.452
Yeah.

54:26.563 --> 54:31.501
Where did I put
that bottle of happy juice?

54:44.752 --> 54:48.323
That's my balloon, asshole.

54:50.894 --> 54:53.930
Is this some kind of joke?

54:53.932 --> 54:55.232
Oh. You're the jackass

54:55.234 --> 54:57.935
who stole the spirit Baton
from the senior class.

54:57.937 --> 55:00.738
Hand it over.

55:01.773 --> 55:04.509
What the hell, man?

55:25.570 --> 55:27.005
Aah!

56:09.325 --> 56:12.394
Damn kids!

56:22.442 --> 56:23.941
Congratulations, your highness.

56:23.943 --> 56:27.546
I think someone needs
to lay off the punch, drunkie.

56:27.548 --> 56:29.782
- What?
- The punch is spiked?

56:29.784 --> 56:30.750
Yes.

56:30.752 --> 56:33.487
Old faithful here poured
the whole damn bottle in it.

56:33.489 --> 56:34.822
Wait.
The bottle wade brought?

56:34.824 --> 56:37.058
- Yeah. Why?
- Oh, no.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.092
He just went to go get it.

56:38.094 --> 56:40.830
Oh, well, just text him
and tell him to hurry back

56:40.832 --> 56:42.531
so it's not all gone.

56:42.533 --> 56:43.766
I left my phone in the car.

56:43.768 --> 56:45.635
Oh, no. It's fine.
I'll text him.

56:45.637 --> 56:47.872
Actually, don't.
I'm gonna go and find him.

56:47.874 --> 56:49.440
We need to have
some quick girl talk.

56:49.442 --> 56:51.844
I need to get the scoop
on his new man.

56:51.846 --> 56:53.545
What?

56:53.547 --> 56:54.714
He's out?

56:54.716 --> 56:55.949
As of about five minutes ago.

56:55.951 --> 56:57.450
I mean, I kind of
helped him along.

56:57.452 --> 57:00.855
But don't say anything
until he tells you himself.

57:00.857 --> 57:01.889
Okay? Promise?

57:01.891 --> 57:04.426
Wow.
Good for him.

57:04.428 --> 57:06.863
Mm-hmm.
- It's about time, man.

57:06.865 --> 57:07.829
I know, right?

57:07.831 --> 57:09.899
Hey, you guys guard
that punch bowl with your lives

57:09.901 --> 57:11.868
until we're back.
Understand?

57:11.870 --> 57:15.839
Yes, ma'am, your highness.

57:16.542 --> 57:17.175
Good lord.

57:17.177 --> 57:20.679
One little tiara,
and suddenly she owns the place.

57:20.681 --> 57:23.182
Punch, anyone?

57:31.694 --> 57:34.163
Wade?

57:52.019 --> 57:54.221
Wade?

58:17.551 --> 58:19.753
Shit!

58:25.896 --> 58:27.530
- Aah!
- What are you doing?

58:27.532 --> 58:30.901
Someone's after me!
He's trying to kill me!

58:30.903 --> 58:32.235
Let go!

58:32.237 --> 58:34.639
Stupid kid.

58:35.673 --> 58:36.741
Aah!

58:36.743 --> 58:38.844
Aah!

59:39.321 --> 59:41.089
Aah! Aah!

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:53.845
I don't think so, buddy.

01:00:53.847 --> 01:00:55.981
Steve, you need to slow down.

01:00:55.983 --> 01:00:57.317
You are about tore up right now.

01:00:57.319 --> 01:00:59.920
Cassie and wade have been
gone for a while, haven't they?

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.955
Maybe they just got trashed

01:01:01.957 --> 01:01:02.957
and decided to leave the party.

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:05.361
Well, yeah, but that's
not really Cassie's style.

01:01:05.363 --> 01:01:06.728
I mean,
she wins homecoming queen,

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.698
and she doesn't even want
to stick around to celebrate?

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.234
Well, they're doing
something without us.

01:01:11.236 --> 01:01:13.336
Well, maybe
we should go look for them.

01:01:13.338 --> 01:01:15.273
And leave the party?

01:01:15.275 --> 01:01:16.274
Seriously?

01:01:16.276 --> 01:01:18.443
Yeah. I'm a little
freaked out, Steve --

01:01:18.445 --> 01:01:19.478
the notes, no word from Annie,

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.014
not to mention Nora and Robby
have disappeared.

01:01:22.016 --> 01:01:23.183
Well, big surprise there.

01:01:23.185 --> 01:01:25.785
Jaclyn, isn't Karl
patrolling right now?

01:01:25.787 --> 01:01:30.124
Maybe. I haven't even
seen that asshole.

01:01:49.118 --> 01:01:53.153
Those kids are gonna get
somebody killed.

01:01:57.793 --> 01:01:58.893
Oh.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.268
Aah! Aah!

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:06.002
Oh. Oh.

01:02:06.004 --> 01:02:12.076
I'm sure
everything is fine, okay?

01:02:12.078 --> 01:02:14.146
Well, I'm not.
Come on.

01:02:14.882 --> 01:02:19.185
Oh, and if you see Karl,
will you remind me to kill him?

01:02:19.187 --> 01:02:21.389
Wait. Wait.

01:02:21.391 --> 01:02:24.526
I got to -- aww.

01:02:25.562 --> 01:02:26.961
- No answer?
- Nope.

01:02:26.963 --> 01:02:28.063
They're not here.

01:02:28.065 --> 01:02:30.600
Shouldn't we just go
to the teachers' lounge?

01:02:30.602 --> 01:02:31.926
Wait. What's that?

01:02:37.443 --> 01:02:38.538
Is that blood?

01:02:39.447 --> 01:02:42.080
What the...

01:02:42.082 --> 01:02:43.871
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:02:45.821 --> 01:02:48.038
Jaclyn, don't go
in there by yourself.

01:02:49.593 --> 01:02:51.169
L-Loren, w-wait.

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:26.135
Steven!

01:03:27.539 --> 01:03:29.373
Oh. Oh. Oh.

01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:31.409
Run! Run!

01:03:33.646 --> 01:03:36.514
Get out of my way.

01:03:36.516 --> 01:03:40.620
We got to get everyone
out of here right now!

01:03:40.622 --> 01:03:41.922
Who was that?

01:03:41.924 --> 01:03:44.191
I don't know!
Come on!

01:03:46.429 --> 01:03:49.332
No way!

01:03:49.334 --> 01:03:51.033
What do we do now?

01:03:51.035 --> 01:03:53.036
Here.

01:03:53.672 --> 01:03:56.240
- Which key is it?
- I don't know.

01:03:56.242 --> 01:03:59.378
I'll try all of them.

01:04:03.451 --> 01:04:06.386
Steve, hurry!

01:04:06.388 --> 01:04:08.088
I'm trying!

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:10.557
He's coming!

01:04:20.237 --> 01:04:22.506
Come on.
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:04:28.548 --> 01:04:30.150
Aah!

01:04:39.394 --> 01:04:41.497
Come on.

01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:52.277
What do we do now?

01:04:52.279 --> 01:04:53.445
I don't know.
Just --

01:04:53.447 --> 01:04:55.581
just be quiet and stay here.
I'm gonna go keep him busy.

01:04:55.583 --> 01:04:56.982
No, Steve, you can't.

01:04:56.984 --> 01:04:58.651
Loren, I'm not asking.

01:04:58.653 --> 01:05:00.353
Just do it.

01:05:01.222 --> 01:05:03.724
We're gonna be fine,
all right?

01:05:03.726 --> 01:05:04.725
Just stay calm.

01:05:04.727 --> 01:05:07.394
I'll go get help and come back.

01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:24.858
Help!

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:26.694
Somebody help!

01:06:26.696 --> 01:06:30.099
Help me!
Loren! Help!

01:06:30.101 --> 01:06:32.468
Help! Help!

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.472
Aah! Aah!

01:06:35.474 --> 01:06:38.143
Aah!

01:06:47.588 --> 01:06:50.224
Steve?

01:07:43.892 --> 01:07:45.960
Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.365
Karl?

01:10:01.465 --> 01:10:02.771
Aah!

01:10:29.665 --> 01:10:30.718
Why are you doing this?

01:10:31.337 --> 01:10:32.295
Steve!

01:10:32.604 --> 01:10:34.575
Jaclyn!
Help, please!

01:10:34.607 --> 01:10:36.419
Somebody help me, please!

01:10:37.076 --> 01:10:39.266
Please!
Help, Steve!

01:10:41.615 --> 01:10:44.519
Please! Help!

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.800
Please!
Somebody help me, please!

01:10:54.029 --> 01:10:57.141
You're wasting
your breath, Loren.

01:10:58.369 --> 01:10:59.777
Mrs. Patterson?

01:11:02.106 --> 01:11:03.786
I don't know what happened

01:11:03.821 --> 01:11:05.579
to your bratty friend Jaclyn.

01:11:06.211 --> 01:11:08.331
I couldn't seem
to find her again.

01:11:09.551 --> 01:11:11.439
But your little Steve...

01:11:12.954 --> 01:11:15.233
He's just a wet spot
under the bleachers.

01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:19.085
I suppose
I could have mopped him up

01:11:19.162 --> 01:11:21.238
and put him in a little bucket
to join you.

01:11:23.667 --> 01:11:26.755
But, really,
I am just so exhausted.

01:11:27.238 --> 01:11:30.015
You kids really put up more
of a fight than I expected.

01:11:32.779 --> 01:11:34.071
Aw, don't do that.

01:11:34.949 --> 01:11:36.520
It's so pathetic.

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:40.219
But why are you doing this?

01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:42.060
I don't understand.

01:11:42.258 --> 01:11:44.727
What don't
you understand, Loren?

01:11:45.128 --> 01:11:46.389
Why would you do this?

01:11:46.497 --> 01:11:48.019
You were always so nice.

01:11:48.767 --> 01:11:49.993
Yes.

01:11:50.768 --> 01:11:52.076
<i>I am nice, Loren.</i>

01:11:52.271 --> 01:11:54.199
And look where it's gotten me...

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.418
Teaching literature

01:11:56.509 --> 01:12:00.095
at this lowbrow,
small-town high school,

01:12:00.513 --> 01:12:04.576
under the supervision of that
manipulative bastard husband,

01:12:04.619 --> 01:12:07.558
who cheats on me
every chance he gets.

01:12:09.524 --> 01:12:12.601
But he's finally gonna get
what he deserves tonight.

01:12:12.963 --> 01:12:14.521
But...

01:12:15.066 --> 01:12:18.003
My friends --
we didn't do anything to you.

01:12:18.037 --> 01:12:19.832
Of course you did.

01:12:20.472 --> 01:12:23.464
What, do you think
this was all for nothing --

01:12:23.542 --> 01:12:26.463
that I'm just
some psychopath lunatic?

01:12:27.613 --> 01:12:30.682
What -- what did we do?

01:12:30.684 --> 01:12:34.688
You took my Billy away.

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:37.300
What are you --
are you talking about?

01:12:37.459 --> 01:12:39.302
Is that so hard to believe --

01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:43.694
that Billy Corbin would want a
disgusting old hag like myself?

01:12:43.735 --> 01:12:45.165
Because he did.

01:12:46.439 --> 01:12:48.674
And he had me, too.

01:12:48.876 --> 01:12:50.647
You and Billy were screwing?

01:12:50.649 --> 01:12:53.454
Is that
such an outlandish concept --

01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:56.527
for a teacher
to be screwing her student?

01:12:56.529 --> 01:12:59.642
I don't think it's unheard of.
Do you, dear?

01:12:59.877 --> 01:13:01.691
But you're married to him.

01:13:02.907 --> 01:13:07.845
That despicable
excuse for a human being.

01:13:11.795 --> 01:13:13.798
Dan.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.970
Dan. Ha.

01:13:15.972 --> 01:13:18.441
He was never married to me.

01:13:18.443 --> 01:13:20.645
He was married to his career.

01:13:22.083 --> 01:13:24.221
But Billy...

01:13:24.256 --> 01:13:27.518
Billy was different.

01:13:28.832 --> 01:13:32.117
He was godsent.

01:13:34.012 --> 01:13:35.669
Failing class.

01:13:36.651 --> 01:13:37.817
Needed tutoring.

01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:41.661
One thing led to another.

01:13:41.663 --> 01:13:45.110
It was...So beautiful.

01:13:47.273 --> 01:13:49.333
And then she came along...

01:13:50.881 --> 01:13:56.196
...sweet, beautiful,
innocent Annie Morgan.

01:13:56.828 --> 01:13:59.805
She became
all he ever talked about.

01:14:02.507 --> 01:14:04.534
Everybody just loved Annie.

01:14:06.082 --> 01:14:09.069
What a disgusting
little creature.

01:14:10.658 --> 01:14:12.213
And you...

01:14:13.799 --> 01:14:17.325
Her best friend,
her biggest accomplice.

01:14:17.541 --> 01:14:20.085
I know what you did, Loren!

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:23.916
I know you're more responsible
for Billy's death than anyone.

01:14:23.951 --> 01:14:26.744
He was going to rape her.

01:14:26.779 --> 01:14:27.528
Oh.

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:29.123
I didn't mean to kill him.

01:14:29.158 --> 01:14:30.981
If I hadn't locked him
in that closet,

01:14:31.016 --> 01:14:32.606
he would have attacked us!

01:14:32.608 --> 01:14:36.291
He wasn't a good person,
Mrs. Patterson.

01:14:36.326 --> 01:14:39.487
He was probably just using you
to get good grades,

01:14:39.522 --> 01:14:41.979
just like he used everyone else
to get what he wanted!

01:14:44.935 --> 01:14:45.924
That's a lie!

01:14:45.959 --> 01:14:48.304
He loved me!
I know he did.

01:14:48.339 --> 01:14:51.200
Billy Corbin
didn't love anyone but himself,

01:14:51.235 --> 01:14:52.693
and you know it!

01:14:52.852 --> 01:14:57.528
Well, it doesn't
really matter anymore, anyway,

01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:58.531
does it?

01:14:58.533 --> 01:14:59.598
'Cause Billy's gone,

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.207
and in just a short time,
you will be, too.

01:15:04.578 --> 01:15:08.786
You and your little friends
are gonna burn,

01:15:08.788 --> 01:15:11.793
just like you did to my Billy.

01:16:01.972 --> 01:16:05.678
Any last words, Loren?

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.816
Go to hell.

01:16:08.253 --> 01:16:12.595
You first.

01:16:41.192 --> 01:16:43.329
You stay put.

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:50.812
Jaclyn Baker, how dare you
disrespect your teacher?

01:16:57.829 --> 01:16:59.699
That does it.

01:16:59.701 --> 01:17:03.975
You both are two seconds away
from being permanently expelled.

01:17:03.977 --> 01:17:07.783
Not in my senior year, bitch.

01:17:35.914 --> 01:17:41.023
How am I gonna clean up
all this mess?

01:17:41.025 --> 01:17:42.058
Damn kids.

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:44.397
- Fred!
- Fred!

01:17:44.399 --> 01:17:45.902
Help me up.

01:17:45.904 --> 01:17:47.338
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:50.315
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.

01:19:04.174 --> 01:19:05.408
Maybe this is a bad idea.

01:19:05.410 --> 01:19:07.788
Loren, it's a great idea.

01:19:07.847 --> 01:19:09.988
And it's courageous
and beautiful

01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:12.691
that you're giving all
of our friends a memoriam today.

01:19:12.887 --> 01:19:15.338
I mean, would you rather
no one mention them at all?

01:19:15.491 --> 01:19:17.169
No.
It's just, I...

01:19:17.191 --> 01:19:19.686
- It's like "oroonoko."
What?

01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:22.019
Mrs. Patterson's class
last fall, remember?

01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:23.946
Tried to forget.

01:19:25.068 --> 01:19:26.453
Well, I sure as hell didn't.

01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:29.038
I remember everything
that crazy bitch said.

01:19:29.575 --> 01:19:34.069
And thinking back, it all
actually makes a lot of sense.

01:19:34.581 --> 01:19:35.854
Jaclyn, do you seriously think

01:19:35.949 --> 01:19:37.969
that any of Mrs. Patterson's
psyche makes sense?

01:19:38.018 --> 01:19:39.410
All I'm saying is,

01:19:39.453 --> 01:19:42.251
if Mrs. Patterson had stuck
to her boundaries,

01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:44.027
none of this
would have happened, right?

01:19:44.559 --> 01:19:48.690
The things we do and say
all have an effect on others.

01:19:48.765 --> 01:19:50.658
And we have a place here.

01:19:50.867 --> 01:19:51.962
<i>You have a place here, Loren.</i>

01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:54.504
And today that place
is right up there on that podium

01:19:54.506 --> 01:19:57.248
making sure as shit
no one ever forgets

01:19:57.276 --> 01:20:00.486
what amazing people Steve
and all of our friends were.

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:05.718
So, let's graduate
and get on with our lives.

01:20:06.156 --> 01:20:07.053
Okay.

01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:09.276
