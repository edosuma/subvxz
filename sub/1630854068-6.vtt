on the off chance you don't
have a date for the CMLs,

20:39.194 --> 20:41.283
let's just say I know a guy.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.331
I have a date.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.768
Mm-hmm,
and it's with a younger man.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.987
Wade Stellings, hmm?

20:50.118 --> 20:52.468
No. Ace Roman, my son. [laughs]

20:52.555 --> 20:55.602
Oh. Well, in that case,

20:55.732 --> 20:57.691
I'd be happy to step aside
for the better man.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.564
Speaking of, I better get back
to the old man.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.361

21:15.491 --> 21:17.493
Oh, I love you more. [laughs]

21:19.800 --> 21:21.018
Bye.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.456
It's all right. It's okay.

21:23.586 --> 21:26.023
Okay.

21:26.154 --> 21:27.895
Well, take good care
of your mom, eh?

21:33.596 --> 21:35.381
Nicky.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.608
It's all gonna be good.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.654
Just 'cause Daddy's gone
back to London

21:47.784 --> 21:49.046
for a while,
it doesn't mean he's gonna...

21:49.220 --> 21:51.005
We know exactly
what it means, Mom.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.398
We're in this family, too,

21:52.572 --> 21:54.443
and some things
you just can't hide.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.315
He loves you very, very much,
more than anything.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.839
-You know that.
-We know, Mom.

21:58.969 --> 22:01.624
We get it.
It's nobody's fault.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.584
Hey, I know it's gonna be hard,

22:04.714 --> 22:06.455
but we're gonna find a new way
how to be as a family.

22:07.978 --> 22:09.850
Okay, go try those tuxedoes on.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.634
I want to see which one
goes best with my dress.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.636
Oh, yeah, about that.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.159
Um, change of plans.

22:15.290 --> 22:16.900
I'm taking Ana.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.211
[both laughing softly]

22:23.385 --> 22:25.082
Did Ace just dump me?

22:25.213 --> 22:27.346
Like father, like son.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.353
[scoffs softly]

22:35.702 --> 22:37.225
I don't recall
you having an appointment.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.619
I don't.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.361
But I've been getting calls
from a few friends

22:42.448 --> 22:44.014
in Nashville and L.A. telling me

22:44.101 --> 22:46.669
that Luke Roman has been
asking questions about me,

22:46.800 --> 22:48.628
trying to dig up dirt.

22:48.758 --> 22:51.674
I was.
Turns out, you're a choir boy.

22:51.848 --> 22:54.895
[laughs]
You are beloved...

22:55.025 --> 22:57.027
from coast to coast.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.421
Good. So then we're cool?

22:59.552 --> 23:02.685
No. No, because
in my experience,

23:02.816 --> 23:04.687
you don't get very far
in this business

23:04.818 --> 23:07.255
without getting
just a tiny bit dirty.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.257
So now
you're even more suspicious

23:09.388 --> 23:10.998
because I'm too clean?

23:11.128 --> 23:13.914
Just seems a bit tidy to me.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.916
It's almost like...

23:16.046 --> 23:18.440
like you're trying
to cover your tracks.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.703
Didn't ever cross your mind that
maybe you haven't found anything

23:20.834 --> 23:22.879
'cause, you know,
there ain't nothing to find?

23:23.010 --> 23:27.884
Did, but then I thought,
if that's the case,

23:28.015 --> 23:30.757
wouldn't hurt to keep on
digging. Right, Jamie?

23:32.585 --> 23:34.369
Well, then.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.632
Knock yourself out.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.768
Oh, don't I plan to.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.911
LUKE: Listen up,
because this is important.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.913
You know,
the press doesn't miss a thing

23:57.000 --> 23:58.480
so you need to be
on your best behavior tonight.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.047
Because even
though you and Nicky are feuding

24:00.177 --> 24:01.614
right now, you're both...

24:01.701 --> 24:03.354
Still sisters, I know.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.182
That's right.
So, if she goes low...

24:05.313 --> 24:06.749
I go lower.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.534
[exhales]
No.

24:08.708 --> 24:09.883
That is not the point
of tonight.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.232
The point is to...

24:11.406 --> 24:13.060
Fake it. Fake smiles...

24:13.147 --> 24:14.844
Fake air kisses.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.063
Don't give the press anything
to write about.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.848
So... just pretend
Nicky didn't steal my song?

24:18.979 --> 24:20.110
And just pretend
that Gigi hasn't been

24:20.241 --> 24:21.634
a complete and utter diva.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.200
Exactly,
because this is show business.

24:23.331 --> 24:24.854
It's not about what's real.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.639
It's about what people see,

24:26.769 --> 24:29.511
so you think you could pretend
you guys are still BFFs?

24:29.598 --> 24:32.253
And have no desire whatsoever
to kill each other?

24:32.427 --> 24:35.212
Hard to say. I guess...

you're wearing it different.

not call our people

about the gowns
that we pulled?

to come with me,

told me the truth.
