<b>After Gon parts ways with Killua 
in order to stop the selection,</b>

00:09.120 --> 00:12.090
<b>he finds himself under attack 
by new Chimera Ants.</b>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.310
<b><i>An owl and a bat?</i></b>

00:16.120 --> 00:18.120
<b><i>They're both nocturnal creatures...</i></b>

00:18.570 --> 00:20.020
<b><i>Hunters of the night!</i></b>

00:21.250 --> 00:22.040
<b><i>From the left?</i></b>

00:22.590 --> 00:23.160
<b><i>Bring it!</i></b>

00:30.250 --> 00:31.730
<b><i>The owl's feathers?</i></b>

00:32.170 --> 00:32.900
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

00:32.900 --> 00:36.620
<b><i>The bat's wings are so loud, 
I can't hear the owl at all!</i></b>

01:57.010 --> 02:02.010
<b>Combination x And x Evolution</b>

02:05.640 --> 02:10.770
<b><i>My ears can pick up sounds of 
higher frequency than other animals'.</i></b>

02:10.770 --> 02:14.910
<b><i>I can hear you stepping on leaves 
and your clothes rustling.</i></b>

02:14.910 --> 02:18.280
<b><i>All of which tell me exactly where you are!</i></b>

02:19.530 --> 02:20.530
<b><i>From the right this time!</i></b>

02:26.690 --> 02:29.230
<b><i>The owl uses its feathers to distract me</i></b>

02:29.230 --> 02:31.290
<b><i>right before the bat attacks...</i></b>

02:31.290 --> 02:33.790
<b><i>They're using both long- and short-range attacks.</i></b>

02:34.870 --> 02:35.720
<b><i>Wait...</i></b>

02:36.220 --> 02:37.170
<b><i>That means...</i></b>

02:40.530 --> 02:43.350
<b><i>He has a lot of aura... But it won't help.</i></b>

02:44.330 --> 02:46.850
<b><i>We are unrivaled in the darkness!</i></b>

02:47.500 --> 02:48.960
<b><i>I should approach this the opposite way!</i></b>

02:49.580 --> 02:52.400
<b><i>If the owl is acting in a support role,</i></b>

02:52.400 --> 02:54.540
<b><i>I should focus on the sound of the bat's wings.</i></b>

02:56.380 --> 02:59.610
<b><i>Right after the owl attacks, 
the bat will attack!</i></b>

03:00.190 --> 03:01.100
<b><i>Now!</i></b>

03:03.970 --> 03:05.240
<b><i>Bingo!</i></b>

03:07.230 --> 03:08.430
<b><i>I missed?</i></b>

03:08.430 --> 03:09.690
<b><i>But my timing was perfect!</i></b>

03:10.220 --> 03:11.370
<b><i>Ultrasonic waves?</i></b>

03:15.070 --> 03:17.250
<b><i>Damn, I missed again?</i></b>

03:17.570 --> 03:21.940
<b>Bah, he's correctly guessing 
the direction of my attacks.</b>

03:21.940 --> 03:24.510
<b>For a human, his ears are sharp.</b>

03:24.780 --> 03:27.000
<b>And his aura keeps growing,</b>

03:27.000 --> 03:29.920
<b>so my feathers aren't doing any damage.</b>

03:31.010 --> 03:35.880
<b><i>The bat uses ultrasonic waves to 
anticipate the timing of my attack.</i></b>

03:36.220 --> 03:39.610
<b><i>Unless I find a way to stop it, I can't win!</i></b>

03:43.970 --> 03:46.810
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

03:47.280 --> 03:49.580
<b>His aura continues to grow.</b>

03:49.580 --> 03:51.250
<b>This could pose a problem.</b>

03:51.250 --> 03:52.160
<b>Not at all...</b>

03:52.420 --> 03:54.020
<b>This is our chance.</b>

03:54.020 --> 03:56.130
<b>He's probably using his ultimate attack.</b>

03:56.130 --> 03:58.170
<b>If we can evade it, we've won.</b>

03:58.540 --> 04:01.170
<b>I can use my ultrasonic waves 
to see it in advance.</b>

04:01.370 --> 04:02.990
<b>Do you need help?</b>

04:02.990 --> 04:06.300
<b>Wait, I'll try getting closer as quietly as I can.</b>

04:10.450 --> 04:11.930
<b><i>The sound's moving away.</i></b>

04:20.200 --> 04:21.820
<b><i>The sound's gone!</i></b>

04:22.320 --> 04:23.580
<b>Now, with no wingbeats...</b>

04:25.740 --> 04:26.820
<b>I dive!</b>

04:27.340 --> 04:28.330
<b><i>That won't work!</i></b>

04:28.610 --> 04:33.080
<b><i>Your wings aren't like the owl's, 
so I can hear you slice through the air.</i></b>

04:33.440 --> 04:36.830
<b><i>Now, show me your ultimate attack.</i></b>

04:38.040 --> 04:39.230
<b><i>He isn't acting?</i></b>

04:40.480 --> 04:42.660
<b><i>I guess a human can only hear so much.</i></b>

04:42.660 --> 04:44.480
<b><i>In that case, I'll make my move...</i></b>

04:44.480 --> 04:46.370
<b><i>I'll slash your jugular!</i></b>

04:48.200 --> 04:50.100
<b><i>Keep my motions minimal.</i></b>

04:51.040 --> 04:53.350
<b><i>Wait until I draw her as near as possible!</i></b>

04:53.860 --> 04:55.300
<b><i>He was baiting me?</i></b>

04:55.300 --> 04:56.100
<b><i>I'm in trouble.</i></b>

04:56.830 --> 05:00.440
<b><i>But his punch will take a 
few milliseconds to land.</i></b>

05:00.440 --> 05:02.670
<b><i>I have plenty of time to fly away!</i></b>

05:07.850 --> 05:08.790
<b><i>The noise...</i></b>

05:09.800 --> 05:10.980
<b><i>I can't see.</i></b>

05:12.320 --> 05:13.980
<b><i>I must get away!</i></b>

05:14.910 --> 05:15.960
<b>You won't escape!</b>

05:15.960 --> 05:16.790
<b><i>Rock...</i></b>

05:17.150 --> 05:19.090
<b><i>You aren't the only one that can use sound...</i></b>

05:19.090 --> 05:19.920
<b><i>Paper...</i></b>

05:20.160 --> 05:21.720
<b><i>...to locate others.</i></b>

05:22.420 --> 05:24.350
<b><i>Paper!</i></b>

05:25.550 --> 05:26.350
<b>All right.</b>

05:30.280 --> 05:31.040
<b><i>A rock?</i></b>

05:31.660 --> 05:33.410
<b><i>He used that to deflect my shot?</i></b>

05:34.520 --> 05:37.940
<b>Gorilla Mode</b>

05:35.380 --> 05:37.400
<b>That was close...</b>

05:37.400 --> 05:38.420
<b><i>Damn it!</i></b>

05:38.420 --> 05:40.730
<b><i>I used my special attack and 
still couldn't bring it down!</i></b>

05:52.640 --> 05:53.700
<b><i>What was that?</i></b>

05:53.700 --> 05:56.140
<b><i>There was a sound that made my head spin.</i></b>

05:56.760 --> 05:58.340
<b><i>Is this ultrasound, too?</i></b>

05:59.230 --> 06:01.880
<b>That stupid kid has a loud voice...</b>

06:02.880 --> 06:06.970
<b>But I'm much better at attacking with sound!</b>

06:07.830 --> 06:10.900
<b><i>This is the true power of their combination.</i></b>

06:10.900 --> 06:13.230
<b><i>They strike with sound and finish with brawn.</i></b>

06:15.290 --> 06:16.730
<b><i>What now?</i></b>

06:17.080 --> 06:18.500
<b><i>Do I cover my ears?</i></b>

06:18.500 --> 06:19.720
<b><i>No, I can't...</i></b>

06:19.720 --> 06:23.230
<b><i>In the darkness, if I handicap my hearing, 
my reaction time will suffer.</i></b>

06:23.540 --> 06:24.280
<b><i>I know!</i></b>

06:24.640 --> 06:25.610
<b>Gyo!</b>

06:26.900 --> 06:28.620
<b>His eyes are shining?</b>

06:28.620 --> 06:30.370
<b>Or is that aura?</b>

06:30.370 --> 06:33.370
<b>He'll rely on his eyes, ignoring sound?</b>

06:33.370 --> 06:35.120
<b>Let's give him another...</b>

06:35.970 --> 06:38.120
<b>Ultrasonic Dissonance</b>

06:36.120 --> 06:38.120
<b><i>Secret Noise!</i></b>

06:50.860 --> 06:51.610
<b><i>Okay!</i></b>

06:52.160 --> 06:53.970
<b><i>This should help some.</i></b>

06:54.280 --> 06:58.420
<b><i>He spit on cloth to make earplugs. Clever...</i></b>

06:59.030 --> 07:02.890
<b><i>Water significantly weakens the power of sound!</i></b>

07:05.390 --> 07:07.950
<b><i>Good, this is better...</i></b>

07:08.640 --> 07:11.030
<b><i>I can locate the owl through its aura.</i></b>

07:12.860 --> 07:13.740
<b><i>Here it comes!</i></b>

07:15.430 --> 07:16.240
<b><i>A feather?</i></b>

07:21.540 --> 07:22.650
<b>Zetsu.</b>

07:22.650 --> 07:25.860
<b><i>Of course... They started off as wild animals.</i></b>

07:25.860 --> 07:28.100
<b><i>From birth, they've known 
to conceal themselves</i></b>

07:29.470 --> 07:31.130
<b><i>when approaching their prey!</i></b>

07:31.380 --> 07:36.160
<b><i>I can fend off their attacks, 
but the ultrasound really hurts.</i></b>

07:36.160 --> 07:38.020
<b><i>If I don't keep up the</i> Gyo,</b>

07:38.020 --> 07:41.640
<b><i>they'll take me down before 
I can even find them!</i></b>

07:42.400 --> 07:47.320
<b><i>In terms of latent aura, 
the kid has a clear advantage.</i></b>

07:47.320 --> 07:50.150
<b><i>Even after being hit all those times, 
he's taken no damage.</i></b>

07:50.570 --> 07:53.920
<b><i>But his level of capability is irrelevant.</i></b>

07:53.920 --> 07:56.710
<b><i>Without a strategy, he's just a moving target.</i></b>

07:57.260 --> 07:59.190
<b><i>They work in perfect sync.</i></b>

07:59.540 --> 08:01.040
<b><i>I have to disrupt that!</i></b>

08:03.970 --> 08:08.800
<b>Ah, he thinks that if he's right on top 
of me, we can't use ultrasound.</b>

08:08.950 --> 08:10.350
<b>Wrong guess!</b>

08:13.070 --> 08:15.400
<b><i>If I use Rock, I can defeat this one.</i></b>

08:15.400 --> 08:19.770
<b><i>But then the bat might run 
and warn the other Ants!</i></b>

08:22.740 --> 08:26.430
<b><i>To me, a starry night is as bright as day.</i></b>

08:26.430 --> 08:28.010
<b><i>As long as I'm not in total darkness,</i></b>

08:28.010 --> 08:33.070
<b><i>I can see you without needing 
to rely on my hearing!</i></b>

08:33.070 --> 08:36.160
<b><i>So if I cover my ears...</i></b>

08:36.700 --> 08:38.580
<b><i>I can attack at will!</i></b>

08:41.590 --> 08:47.620
<b><i>The kid has shrouded his entire 
body in aura to avoid damage.</i></b>

08:47.620 --> 08:52.770
<b><i>But that reduces the strength of his attacks, 
making it impossible to stand against them.</i></b>

08:52.770 --> 08:56.890
<b><i>At this rate, he'll never defeat them...</i></b>

08:57.450 --> 08:59.600
<b><i>It's over for this kid.</i></b>

08:59.900 --> 09:02.610
<b><i>Their weakness is that</i></b>

09:02.610 --> 09:05.850
<b><i>their movements are always in sync!</i></b>

09:09.010 --> 09:10.110
<b><i>Here!</i></b>

09:12.450 --> 09:14.790
<b><i>They always take positions on opposite sides</i></b>

09:14.790 --> 09:16.850
<b><i>to avoid both being targeted at once.</i></b>

09:18.620 --> 09:20.660
<b><i>When the owl is in front of me,</i></b>

09:24.280 --> 09:26.000
<b><i>the bat is directly behind me!</i></b>

09:29.770 --> 09:31.250
<b><i>A giant wall?</i></b>

09:36.750 --> 09:38.620
<b><i>The real wall was</i></b>

09:39.480 --> 09:41.020
<b><i>behind me...</i></b>

09:49.400 --> 09:53.030
<b><i>He turned our teamwork against us?</i></b>

09:58.840 --> 10:02.280
<b><i>If I only have one opponent, 
I can concentrate on attacking.</i></b>

10:02.660 --> 10:05.590
<b><i>Once he pulls off one plan, 
things will go his way...</i></b>

10:05.590 --> 10:10.380
<b><i>But that attack won't be enough 
to get him anywhere here.</i></b>

10:11.890 --> 10:12.850
<b><i>Damn!</i></b>

10:14.800 --> 10:17.680
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

10:18.070 --> 10:19.900
<b><i>Rock... Paper...</i></b>

10:19.900 --> 10:21.050
<b>Why, you...</b>

10:22.470 --> 10:25.230
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

10:27.610 --> 10:30.190
<b>I made sure to knock you west!</b>

10:30.520 --> 10:32.590
<b>Go back to NGL!</b>

10:33.030 --> 10:35.710
<b><i>That was incredibly strong...</i></b>

10:35.710 --> 10:38.700
<b><i>I see... This is his real ultimate attack.</i></b>

10:38.700 --> 10:40.580
<b><i>I take back what I said.</i></b>

10:40.580 --> 10:41.950
<b><i>This kid can be useful.</i></b>

10:42.280 --> 10:44.700
<b><i>But how do I proceed?</i></b>

10:46.720 --> 10:48.210
<b>Diego has been dethroned.</b>

10:49.170 --> 10:53.840
<b>Brainwashed soldiers are running around, 
slaughtering entire villages and towns!</b>

10:54.180 --> 10:55.900
<b>Diego has fallen?</b>

10:55.900 --> 10:57.270
<b>Is that true?</b>

10:57.270 --> 11:01.220
<b>But we all saw the soldiers try to kill everyone.</b>

11:01.490 --> 11:03.090
<b>There's no time to think about it!</b>

11:03.090 --> 11:05.100
<b>Just leave this village and run, anywhere!</b>

11:05.100 --> 11:08.740
<b>Warn people in other areas!</b>

11:10.730 --> 11:12.970
<b><i>Who's interfering?</i></b>

11:13.520 --> 11:15.020
<b><i>It was in the southeast this time.</i></b>

11:15.020 --> 11:17.200
<b><i>Some of my puppets have been stopped.</i></b>

11:17.660 --> 11:18.740
<b><i>That was fast.</i></b>

11:19.220 --> 11:23.680
<b><i>Whoever they are, they're keeping 
low and unpredictable.</i></b>

11:23.680 --> 11:24.820
<b><i>An assassin?</i></b>

11:25.180 --> 11:27.750
<b><i>But they are acting on their own...</i></b>

11:28.310 --> 11:29.460
<b><i>A decoy?</i></b>

11:30.490 --> 11:33.290
<b><i>This is so annoying...</i></b>

11:33.290 --> 11:35.380
<b>I wanna kill them!</b>

11:38.420 --> 11:41.990
<b>It is no more than a diversion.</b>

11:42.580 --> 11:43.890
<b>Which means we cannot go.</b>

11:44.360 --> 11:45.900
<b>You think?</b>

11:45.900 --> 11:49.140
<b>But it doesn't feel like the purpose is to bait us.</b>

11:49.810 --> 11:54.900
<b>They're being careful not to let me catch them...</b>

11:55.490 --> 11:58.540
<b>It may all be an act to draw you out.</b>

11:59.280 --> 12:01.070
<b>But perhaps I'm over-thinking things.</b>

12:01.520 --> 12:02.400
<b>But... But...</b>

12:03.170 --> 12:08.660
<b>Ah, how I long to indulge myself 
in the delight of agonizing...</b>

12:09.710 --> 12:11.690
<b>It is the sweet trap of the thought process.</b>

12:12.440 --> 12:13.850
<b>Nothing more.</b>

12:15.280 --> 12:16.620
<b>The answer is simple.</b>

12:17.440 --> 12:19.900
<b>Our mission is to protect the King.</b>

12:20.330 --> 12:25.160
<b>We can let the other Ants handle the rest.</b>

12:29.420 --> 12:30.930
<b>Is it our turn?</b>

12:31.660 --> 12:32.810
<b>When we were injured</b>

12:32.810 --> 12:35.710
<b>and on the run from the Hunters, you took us in.</b>

12:35.710 --> 12:39.640
<b>You even gave us instruction on using our power.</b>

12:40.710 --> 12:44.700
<b>It is time for us to return the favor!</b>

12:48.320 --> 12:51.450
<b>Someone's running around 
and disabling my puppets.</b>

12:51.940 --> 12:53.090
<b>Can you kill them?</b>

12:53.550 --> 12:55.040
<b>You can count on me.</b>

12:55.040 --> 12:56.960
<b>Take this cell phone.</b>

12:57.530 --> 12:59.960
<b>We can't use telepathy.</b>

13:00.440 --> 13:03.690
<b>I'll give you updates on their location.</b>

13:04.040 --> 13:04.990
<b>Understood.</b>

13:10.230 --> 13:12.980
<b>Can we really trust them?</b>

13:13.250 --> 13:16.100
<b>Nah, I don't trust them.</b>

13:16.440 --> 13:20.020
<b>They're the ones trying to earn our trust,</b>

13:20.020 --> 13:22.700
<b>so they'll try hard to carry out their mission.</b>

13:23.200 --> 13:27.610
<b>It's possible that they're looking for an 
opportunity to stab us in the back.</b>

13:29.250 --> 13:34.280
<b>In that case, we should treat them accordingly.</b>

13:37.570 --> 13:41.370
<b><i>The closest village is at two o'clock.</i></b>

13:41.370 --> 13:43.630
<b><i>The next closest villages are 
at eight and ten o'clock...</i></b>

13:44.030 --> 13:47.630
<b><i>Should I skip them and head for 
Taba, forty kilometers away?</i></b>

13:50.500 --> 13:51.390
<b><i>Play it safe...</i></b>

13:52.160 --> 13:54.140
<b><i>Don't let anyone find me.</i></b>

14:03.650 --> 14:05.150
<b><i>I can't go this way.</i></b>

14:20.470 --> 14:21.770
<b>This is bad...</b>

14:21.770 --> 14:24.180
<b>I should have taken matters into my own hands.</b>

14:24.790 --> 14:26.110
<b>What's wrong?</b>

14:26.110 --> 14:30.470
<b>As we speak, Cheetu is racing 
toward East Gorteau.</b>

14:31.050 --> 14:34.090
<b>It seems the Hunters that replaced 
us failed to capture him.</b>

14:34.750 --> 14:36.950
<b>Is he headed toward us?</b>

14:36.950 --> 14:40.690
<b>No, if he continues on his current 
course, he'll pass far to the south.</b>

14:42.230 --> 14:43.690
<b>Where are you going?</b>

14:44.690 --> 14:46.430
<b>Don't try to stop me...</b>

14:46.430 --> 14:48.950
<b>I'm already in a bad mood.</b>

14:49.490 --> 14:53.980
<b>The Hunter Association has captured three 
hundred and nineteen Chimera Ants</b>

14:53.980 --> 14:56.170
<b>outside of NGL as of yesterday.</b>

14:56.580 --> 15:01.460
<b>But Colt confirmed that none of 
them were Squadron Leaders.</b>

15:02.280 --> 15:03.410
<b>According to him,</b>

15:03.410 --> 15:05.950
<b>there are eight Squadron Leaders left 
that would be considered aggressive.</b>

15:06.530 --> 15:11.470
<b>Hunters have encountered four, 
but they all got away.</b>

15:12.170 --> 15:16.100
<b>Cheetu is coming to East Gorteau for a reason.</b>

15:16.100 --> 15:18.680
<b>He must know the King is here.</b>

15:19.340 --> 15:24.730
<b>He's choosing to return to the King's 
service in order to increase his power.</b>

15:25.420 --> 15:30.360
<b>My ability is still in effect, 
and I have more raw strength.</b>

15:30.360 --> 15:34.650
<b>But if we let him slip away and 
he gains even more power,</b>

15:34.650 --> 15:36.740
<b>there's no telling who will win next time.</b>

15:36.740 --> 15:41.000
<b>If we allow more Ants like him to join the King,</b>

15:41.510 --> 15:44.470
<b>we'll never be able to draw the Royal Guard away.</b>

15:44.780 --> 15:47.410
<b>Are you still gonna try to stop me? Eh?</b>

15:47.780 --> 15:50.210
<b>If you are, I'll fight you first.</b>

15:52.760 --> 15:55.240
<b>First, we contact Morel-san.</b>

15:56.640 --> 16:02.270
<b>If worse comes to worst, 
he'll need to replace us.</b>

16:02.840 --> 16:04.270
<b>I'll come with you.</b>

16:06.400 --> 16:09.510
<b>This should increase the odds 
of capturing that Ant.</b>

16:11.790 --> 16:14.620
<b>It's Knuckle... Something's come up.</b>

16:15.080 --> 16:17.330
<b>Yes, I'd guess so.</b>

16:17.330 --> 16:18.030
<b>Probably.</b>

16:18.440 --> 16:19.470
<b>Yes.</b>

16:19.470 --> 16:20.290
<b>So, uh...</b>

16:20.650 --> 16:22.550
<b>Hello? Hello?</b>

16:25.230 --> 16:26.040
<b>Fools!</b>

16:27.330 --> 16:29.820
<b>I told you to send Riakke!</b>

16:30.200 --> 16:32.450
<b>He'd have been perfect for this.</b>

16:33.790 --> 16:34.910
<b>Huh?!</b>

16:34.910 --> 16:36.800
<b>I don't give a damn!</b>

16:36.800 --> 16:38.060
<b>What's wrong?</b>

16:38.840 --> 16:41.840
<b>The Chimera Ant we were tracking escaped.</b>

16:42.240 --> 16:46.420
<b>The review board didn't send 
the Hunter we requested!</b>

16:46.820 --> 16:48.840
<b>Who did they send?</b>

16:48.840 --> 16:50.570
<b>Some Hunter I've never heard of.</b>

16:50.990 --> 16:52.340
<b>Probably an Association dog.</b>

16:52.780 --> 16:53.820
<b>An Association dog...</b>

16:54.560 --> 16:59.590
<b>You mean Hunters who only take jobs 
through the Hunter Association.</b>

17:00.200 --> 17:02.330
<b>It isn't surprising that they have less talent.</b>

17:02.780 --> 17:06.810
<b>Damn! I should have gone 
to talk to Riakke myself!</b>

17:07.170 --> 17:09.400
<b>Don't be foolish!</b>

17:09.740 --> 17:12.830
<b>If you do anything without board approval,</b>

17:12.830 --> 17:15.840
<b>the Chairman will get all the grief.</b>

17:16.430 --> 17:22.350
<b>He had to argue with the executive 
committee just to get the two of us here.</b>

17:23.160 --> 17:26.240
<b>But they don't understand the situation.</b>

17:26.240 --> 17:30.610
<b>They base it on past accomplishments 
and donations to the Association...</b>

17:30.610 --> 17:34.890
<b>The review board has always been inflexible.</b>

17:35.560 --> 17:38.620
<b>How can you be so relaxed?!</b>

17:39.470 --> 17:42.780
<b>If we underestimate the Squadron 
Leaders, we'll pay dearly for it.</b>

17:44.420 --> 17:46.090
<b>They're strong.</b>

17:46.470 --> 17:49.540
<b>After all, they listen to their deepest desires.</b>

17:50.360 --> 17:53.400
<b>So they have the talent to quickly master</b>

17:53.400 --> 17:56.180
<b>the abilities they need the most.</b>

17:56.540 --> 18:01.510
<b>If we let the review board bring self-preservation 
and formality in, we won't get help in time.</b>

18:02.710 --> 18:06.060
<b>Maybe that's their goal...</b>

18:06.590 --> 18:10.030
<b>You refer to the rumors that 
the Vice-Chairman's faction</b>

18:10.030 --> 18:12.070
<b>controls the review board?</b>

18:12.620 --> 18:15.410
<b>That they're only giving work to Hunters</b>

18:15.410 --> 18:20.550
<b>who agree to vote for him in the next election?</b>

18:21.860 --> 18:24.260
<b>There's no evidence of anything 
like that happening.</b>

18:25.340 --> 18:27.630
<b>You think they're stupid enough to get caught?</b>

18:28.100 --> 18:29.850
<b>Look at the facts!</b>

18:29.850 --> 18:34.480
<b>They've let every Squadron Leader 
they've faced escape alive!</b>

18:36.280 --> 18:42.150
<b>If this expedition fails, 
the Chairman will shoulder the blame.</b>

18:42.730 --> 18:46.010
<b>They're willing to do whatever it 
takes to guarantee that result.</b>

18:46.510 --> 18:48.400
<b>As the Chimera Ants claim more victims,</b>

18:48.400 --> 18:51.610
<b>the voices calling for the Chairman's 
resignation grow louder.</b>

18:52.470 --> 18:56.110
<b>Too bad the voices belong to a bunch 
of people sitting at their desks!</b>

18:57.830 --> 19:03.190
<b>If we take out the King and five million 
people are already dead, we've failed!</b>

19:04.300 --> 19:07.170
<b>We already knew that.</b>

19:07.170 --> 19:09.120
<b>The Chairman is prepared.</b>

19:09.430 --> 19:13.400
<b>When he developed this plan, he was 
well aware of the consequences.</b>

19:13.890 --> 19:17.520
<b>He knew how long assuring victory would take,</b>

19:18.030 --> 19:19.630
<b>and the resulting casualties...</b>

19:21.400 --> 19:23.640
<b>Five million is the low end...</b>

19:24.460 --> 19:26.200
<b>That's too high!</b>

19:32.200 --> 19:33.230
<b>Marcos-san?</b>

19:34.450 --> 19:35.150
<b>What?</b>

19:35.540 --> 19:38.150
<b>The phones have been ringing nonstop!</b>

19:38.820 --> 19:42.910
<b>Rumors of a coup d'état are flying around.</b>

19:43.440 --> 19:47.150
<b>And it's been discovered that mass murders 
are taking place all over the nation.</b>

19:47.150 --> 19:49.860
<b>This is no rumor. It's actually happening!</b>

19:49.860 --> 19:51.580
<b>What's going on here?</b>

19:51.580 --> 19:53.670
<b>Are you responsible for this?</b>

19:53.990 --> 19:55.790
<b>We haven't done anything!</b>

19:56.550 --> 19:58.920
<b><i>The citizens have learned the 
truth about the selection?</i></b>

20:00.550 --> 20:02.080
<b>We'll discuss this later.</b>

20:02.520 --> 20:05.090
<b>Return to the office before anyone suspects you.</b>

20:05.090 --> 20:05.920
<b>Morel!</b>

20:06.780 --> 20:12.190
<b><i>Our beloved leader, Diego, has an 
urgent announcement to make.</i></b>

20:12.550 --> 20:16.940
<b><i>To ensure that our great leader's message 
will be heard throughout the nation,</i></b>

20:16.940 --> 20:21.680
<b><i>we request that relay speakers in all 
regions be turned to maximum volume.</i></b>

20:21.680 --> 20:27.200
<b><i>All televisions and radios should be on, 
and the volume raised to maximum.</i></b>

20:28.550 --> 20:31.440
<b><i>Good evening, my beloved comrades.</i></b>

20:31.830 --> 20:33.070
<b><i>I am Diego.</i></b>

20:33.580 --> 20:38.800
<b><i>I have just declared that East 
Gorteau is under martial law.</i></b>

20:39.340 --> 20:44.220
<b><i>This precaution is being taken to combat 
malcontents that would foment rebellion.</i></b>

20:44.470 --> 20:49.260
<b><i>I ask all comrades to stay indoors, 
with your doors locked.</i></b>

20:50.190 --> 20:54.540
<b><i>Anyone outdoors without permission will 
be identified as a rebel and punished.</i></b>

20:54.850 --> 20:59.750
<b><i>I ask that you not lend an ear 
to false rumors being spread,</i></b>

20:59.750 --> 21:02.210
<b><i>but that you follow my instructions.</i></b>

21:02.210 --> 21:07.680
<b><i>The soldiers of my special forces 
will be visiting your residences,</i></b>

21:07.680 --> 21:10.240
<b><i>to see if any rebels are hiding inside.</i></b>

21:10.610 --> 21:14.250
<b><i>Do not open your doors for anyone else.</i></b>

21:14.740 --> 21:16.800
<b>Their response was too fast.</b>

21:16.800 --> 21:18.680
<b>It must be Killua and Gon.</b>

21:18.680 --> 21:20.290
<b>They weren't supposed to act.</b>

21:20.910 --> 21:23.870
<b>But this must be part of the Chimera Ants' plan.</b>

21:24.440 --> 21:26.510
<b>They were so well-prepared, 
I can't believe otherwise.</b>

21:27.420 --> 21:30.970
<b>The citizens learning the truth about 
the selection wasn't important.</b>

21:30.970 --> 21:35.330
<b>In fact, if they did, the military 
would have an excuse to mobilize.</b>

21:36.390 --> 21:40.770
<b>East Gorteau has been placed under martial law,</b>

21:41.470 --> 21:47.620
<b>completely isolated from the rest of the world.</b>

21:52.010 --> 21:54.480
<b>Hmm... No problem.</b>

21:55.060 --> 21:57.400
<b>You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.</b>

21:58.440 --> 22:00.060
<b>I will stop them all.</b>

23:24.380 --> 23:26.900
<b>Next time: Tracking x And x Pursuit.</b>

23:26.900 --> 23:27.840
<b>98!</b>

23:27.840 --> 23:28.540
<b>99!</b>

23:28.540 --> 23:29.270
<b>100!</b>

23:29.270 --> 23:30.410
<b>We want to thank everyone...</b>

23:30.410 --> 23:31.570
<b>...for helping us reach 100 episodes!</b>

23:31.570 --> 23:32.420
<b>Thank you!</b>

23:32.420 --> 23:33.760
<b>We hope you keep watching!</b>
