00:40.720 --> 00:42.480
The world will have to
deal with us.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.120
<i>Previously on The 4400...</i>

00:46.200 --> 00:47.160
I'm not tired.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.960
Are you worried about
what you might dream?

00:49.120 --> 00:51.160
<i>- Who's cassie?
- I'm Kyle's ability.</i>

00:51.240 --> 00:52.680
<i>They did something to me
last night.</i>

00:52.800 --> 00:55.000
<i>When we need him,
he'll be there for us.</i>

00:55.440 --> 00:56.520
They put something into me.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.800
- Where's kyle?
- Kyle and I agree. You're not ready.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.880
You don't understand what we're trying
to accomplish here.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.880
- Then tell me, what is this place?
- It's a model for a better world.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.600
They're looking to make a better
life for themselves, and they did.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.080
<i>Promicin isn't just here
to improve the world.</i>

01:09.200 --> 01:11.120
It's here to bring
heaven to earth.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.840
You're supposed to make it happen,
and I'm supposed to help you.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.400
You are going to
lead us all to God.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.880
- So, what do we do now?
- We're going to Seattle.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.320
Everyone's waiting.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.160
These are
good people.

01:31.680 --> 01:32.640
Loyal.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.960
They believe in this new world
I've promised them.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.080
It's not just a promise.
It's going to happen...

01:39.200 --> 01:40.160
starting today.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.400
Once we take this step,

01:45.520 --> 01:47.000
there is no going back.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.880
I need you to tell me, Kyle,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.680
that no matter the cost,
no matter the sacrifice,

01:52.760 --> 01:54.360
this will all be worth it.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.240
You know
it's worth it, Jordan.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.800
This is the right time.
This is the right place.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.760
If you didn't believe that,
we wouldn't be in Seattle.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.120
Let's go change the world.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.480
<i>We believe in you, Jordan.</i>

02:18.720 --> 02:19.680
<i>He's here!</i>

02:29.840 --> 02:30.880
Three years ago,

02:31.840 --> 02:33.600
4400 missing people,

02:33.880 --> 02:35.560
each with
an extraordinary ability,

02:36.160 --> 02:37.840
reappeared in a ball of light,

02:37.960 --> 02:39.240
and the world wondered why.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.680
Six months ago,

02:41.360 --> 02:43.400
the promicin shot
made those abilities

02:43.520 --> 02:46.160
accessible to anyone
with the courage to take it.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.080
And again...

02:48.520 --> 02:49.880
the world wondered why.

02:51.800 --> 02:52.760
Today...

02:52.920 --> 02:54.000
we tell them why.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.280
Today,
we answer all the questions.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.320
And after today...

03:01.120 --> 03:02.920
the world
will never be the same.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.200
I'm so sorry.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.280
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.480
Those noodles were so
overcooked.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.200
Diana,
stop apologizing.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.720
That's the first meal
I've had in months

03:34.800 --> 03:36.720
that didn't come out of a microwave
or a take-out carton.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.640
All these years
we've been partners, and I...

03:38.760 --> 03:40.200
haven't had you over for dinner...

03:40.280 --> 03:42.080
You never felt
this sorry for me before.

03:42.800 --> 03:43.760
What?

03:43.920 --> 03:45.840
Look, when a woman
invites a man over for dinner,

03:45.960 --> 03:47.520
it's for one of two reasons...

03:47.920 --> 03:49.160
Attraction...

03:49.440 --> 03:51.360
or pity,
and I'm putting my money on pity.

03:54.680 --> 03:55.800
Between Alana and Kyle,

03:55.920 --> 03:57.600
you have had
a tough run of it lately.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.560
Me too.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.640
I figured there's nothing like
overcooked pasta to...

04:02.840 --> 04:04.280
start the healing process.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.640
You know, no matter how hard
you rub that mole,

04:09.760 --> 04:10.880
it's not going to go away.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.280
You're right.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.680
It's just a mole.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.600
I mean, I'm still me.
I'm not one of the marked, or whatever.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.720
No, I never said you were.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.680
This job can mess
with your head, huh?

04:25.920 --> 04:27.040
Speaking of work,

04:27.520 --> 04:28.760
what do you think of Meghan?

04:29.520 --> 04:30.600
She's different...

04:31.360 --> 04:32.840
from what you'd expect
for a boss.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.240
That's a little noncommittal.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.040
Have you not noticed?
I think she's a little...

04:37.200 --> 04:38.360
a little focused on you.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.600
What?
Focused on me?

04:42.640 --> 04:44.320
Mom, Jordan Collier...

04:44.680 --> 04:45.800
He's about to
do something.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.360
Something big.

04:47.960 --> 04:48.920
You saw him?

04:49.560 --> 04:50.520
Did you have a vision?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.080
Sweetie,
where is he?

04:52.800 --> 04:54.640
He's here, in Seattle.

04:55.720 --> 04:56.680
Kyle's with him.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.280
He's right here.

[ www.seriessub.com ]

06:02.920 --> 06:05.240
Maia, I've imported your drawing
into a graphics file.

06:05.480 --> 06:06.800
We can make any changes you want,

06:06.920 --> 06:08.400
to get it closer to what you saw.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.120
The reds,

06:10.520 --> 06:11.800
they should be a little darker,

06:12.480 --> 06:13.680
especially around the middle.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.760
Maia, are you sure this represents
some part of Seattle?

06:19.840 --> 06:21.200
The picture had...

06:21.320 --> 06:23.440
some kind of lines
under the colors.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.800
- Like that?
- There's a definite pattern here.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.840
Maybe it's an elevation study?
Red for peaks,

06:28.920 --> 06:30.480
blue and green
for lower elevations.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.160
It could be a population survey,

06:32.240 --> 06:34.120
a study of homes
of median income.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.960
ethnic,
religious groupings.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.000
- That narrows it down.
- Actually, it does.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.440
All those things require
comprehensive data analyses,

06:40.560 --> 06:42.920
- and those don't come cheap.
- Which means a big corporate

06:43.040 --> 06:44.280
or a government study.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.200
Yeah, what?
D.O.D., N.S.A., census bureau.

06:47.280 --> 06:50.000
Odds are, this image is sitting
in a government computer somewhere,

06:50.120 --> 06:51.240
which means I can find it.

07:05.000 --> 07:05.960
Kara...

07:06.240 --> 07:07.400
You don't
have to leave.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.240
I didn't want to
overstay my welcome.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.800
Listen, I hope you're
okay with everything.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.760
I didn't really
plan on...

07:18.520 --> 07:19.960
More than dinner
and a movie?

07:20.920 --> 07:23.520
It's just, these last few days
have been great,

07:25.200 --> 07:27.560
but your mom is a client,
or she was a client.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.520
You make it sound like
you were her lawyer.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.600
My mother had
stage four leukemia.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.520
You saved her life.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.280
I just don't want you to think
that I make a habit

07:36.400 --> 07:38.880
out of sleeping with
the people that I help.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.840
I know that.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.880
I'd love I could stay.
I just have this appointment

07:48.960 --> 07:50.720
- first thing in the morning.
- All right.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.200
I'll call you.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.840
I guess that answers
my question.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.880
I was gonna ask you
if you were sure you wanted

08:11.960 --> 08:13.200
to be a part of this operation.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.600
Believe me, I want Collier
caught as much as anyone.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.600
It's not Collier
I was thinking about.

08:18.640 --> 08:19.600
It's your son.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.920
Look, the only thing we have
on Kyle is taking promicin.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.480
I can still help him cut a deal,
get him on the inhibitor.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.680
But the longer he's with collier,

08:27.800 --> 08:29.560
the harder it's gonna be for me
to help him.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.360
Are you sure he...
wants to be helped?

08:32.559 --> 08:35.159
He's my son, I've got to believe
I can still reach him.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.080
I'm sorry.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.520
I know.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.600
It's a toxicology study.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.880
I got it from the E.P.A.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.280
The red areas indicate
a high level of pollution,

08:57.360 --> 08:59.360
pink a little less, then
all the way to green...

08:59.480 --> 09:01.480
Marco, do you know
where Collier is?

09:03.840 --> 09:05.800
The Duwamish river delta.
South seattle.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.880
One of the most polluted places
in the country.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.240
We're talking old refineries,
dead end streets, and rotting factories.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.760
So, not a nice place.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.520
Unless you wanna hide,
then it's perfect.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.800
That place is a maze. It could take days
to do a complete search.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.760
Then you better get started, because
according to what Maia's told us,

09:19.880 --> 09:22.520
whatever Jordan Collier's planning,
this is ground zero.

09:30.670 --> 09:33.030
Bobby, head that way.
We're going to cover this side.

09:33.590 --> 09:36.470
I still don't understand why Collier
would risk coming back to Seattle.

09:36.590 --> 09:38.150
It's like he's daring us
to catch him.

09:38.230 --> 09:39.990
We wouldn't even know he was here
if it weren't for Maia.

09:40.070 --> 09:41.830
It's not like he's showed
up at a Mariners game.

09:41.910 --> 09:43.470
This place is pretty
low profile.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.710
I don't think this qualifies
as low profile.

09:57.070 --> 09:58.670
Somebody's feeling
pretty confident.

10:00.550 --> 10:01.990
Tom, what are those lights?

10:16.270 --> 10:18.750
It's almost like they're marking
some kind of perimeter.

10:18.870 --> 10:20.270
Maybe they're warning lights,

10:20.670 --> 10:21.750
an alarm system.

10:22.510 --> 10:23.670
I'm calling for back-up.

10:25.670 --> 10:28.470
<i>This is Skouris.
We need help down at Duwamish delta.</i>

10:31.750 --> 10:32.750
Tom, what?

10:35.950 --> 10:36.910
Get back!

10:50.870 --> 10:52.110
We won't be doing that again.

11:01.270 --> 11:02.710
Senator Lenhoff is here.

11:03.550 --> 11:05.190
Senator, I didn't know
you were in town.

11:05.310 --> 11:07.350
Come to say hello to your
favorite future councilman?

11:07.430 --> 11:09.390
Actually, I'm here
to ruin your morning.

11:13.990 --> 11:15.310
"Sex for miracles"?

11:15.430 --> 11:16.550
It's all over the net.

11:16.630 --> 11:19.590
Every anti-4400 wingnut
is running with it.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.710
This says that I forced Kara
to have sex with me,

11:21.830 --> 11:23.950
- in exchange for healing her mother.
- You know this girl?

11:24.070 --> 11:27.230
I didn't exchange sex for miracles,
or for anything else, for that matter.

11:27.350 --> 11:28.310
But you slept with her?

11:29.070 --> 11:31.110
She asked me out to dinner.
We went out on a date.

11:31.230 --> 11:33.070
We had a really good time.
We went on a couple more dates.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.310
- I like this girl.
- Farrell, did you or did you not

11:35.390 --> 11:36.750
have sex with this woman?

11:37.430 --> 11:39.590
- Last night.
- And it hits the net this morning.

11:39.710 --> 11:40.670
What does that tell you?

11:41.190 --> 11:42.870
You think this is
some kind of set-up?

11:42.990 --> 11:44.550
I'll have my people
start digging.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.470
It should be easy enough
to discredit her. A girl like this,

11:47.710 --> 11:49.350
- there's always something.
- Senator...

11:50.070 --> 11:53.510
Let's hold off on the character
assassination until I talk to kara.

11:55.350 --> 11:57.070
You want to play nice,
give it a try.

11:57.590 --> 11:59.270
But if this girl's
who I think she is,

11:59.910 --> 12:01.470
tomorrow we come out swinging.

12:05.910 --> 12:07.790
These lights, or...
beacons or whatever,

12:07.910 --> 12:09.790
they must've been built
by one of Jordan's followers.

12:09.910 --> 12:11.630
They extend from here,
all the way to the river.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.510
They wall off about
a square mile of buildings

12:13.630 --> 12:15.270
right in the most toxic
part of the delta.

12:15.350 --> 12:16.910
We called in Seattle P.D.
and the guard.

12:17.030 --> 12:18.990
No one's getting in or out
without us knowing it.

12:19.070 --> 12:20.990
So Collier's backed
himself into a corner.

12:21.150 --> 12:23.630
All we have to do is figure out
a way to get past these lights.

12:23.950 --> 12:25.630
I think you're going to
want to see this.

12:29.390 --> 12:30.350
<i>For too long,</i>

12:30.430 --> 12:32.270
<i>those of us with special gifts,</i>

12:32.550 --> 12:34.750
<i>the 4400,
and those who've taken promicin,</i>

12:35.710 --> 12:38.470
<i>have had to conceal
and even neglect their abilities.</i>

12:38.550 --> 12:41.870
<i>Well, I stand before you today
to tell you the time for hiding...</i>

12:42.310 --> 12:43.270
<i>is over.</i>

12:43.870 --> 12:45.630
And that the time for miracles...

12:46.030 --> 12:46.990
has begun.

12:47.390 --> 12:49.230
And it starts right here.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.110
<i>Today, we claim...</i>

12:51.590 --> 12:54.190
<i>this godforsaken piece of earth...
ours.</i>

12:54.470 --> 12:56.590
Did this guy just say
he's annexing part of Seattle?

12:56.670 --> 12:58.750
<i>- It sounded like that.
- ...to make it whole again.</i>

12:59.390 --> 13:01.150
<i>Using our abilities,</i>

13:01.430 --> 13:03.310
<i>we will heal its toxic soil.</i>

13:03.430 --> 13:06.510
We will cleanse
its polluted waters,

13:07.270 --> 13:10.230
and we will turn this...
blighted place

13:10.910 --> 13:11.870
into a garden.

13:13.190 --> 13:14.750
<i>For those willing to join us,</i>

13:15.470 --> 13:16.430
<i>we welcome you.</i>

13:16.550 --> 13:17.990
<i>All you need is an ability,</i>

13:18.510 --> 13:20.750
<i>and the willingness to become
part of a miracle.</i>

13:21.070 --> 13:23.070
<i>But, the blessings we bring</i>

13:24.030 --> 13:27.230
<i>will not just be limited to this...
small place,</i>

13:27.590 --> 13:29.150
<i>because this is the beginning</i>

13:29.510 --> 13:30.950
<i>of a much wider...</i>

13:31.830 --> 13:33.070
<i>and deeper healing.</i>

13:33.950 --> 13:35.830
Because the miracles
we work here,

13:36.550 --> 13:38.270
we intend to work everywhere.

13:39.590 --> 13:40.550
<i>Help us,</i>

13:40.870 --> 13:42.390
<i>work with us,
and together,</i>

13:42.670 --> 13:46.310
<i>we can transform this world
into a paradise.</i>

13:46.670 --> 13:48.750
Yeah, assuming
you take promicin and survive.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.710
<i>For those of you
unwilling to join us,</i>

13:51.110 --> 13:53.350
all we ask
is that you leave us in peace.

13:54.630 --> 13:56.190
If you insist on interfering,

13:57.230 --> 13:59.070
if you threaten us,

13:59.550 --> 14:01.070
or in any way attack us,

14:01.550 --> 14:03.030
<i>there will be consequences,</i>

14:03.430 --> 14:04.390
<i>immediate...</i>

14:04.830 --> 14:05.990
<i>and severe.</i>

14:07.110 --> 14:09.150
<i>But I did not come
to intimidate.</i>

14:09.430 --> 14:11.350
<i>This is a message of hope,</i>

14:11.710 --> 14:13.390
<i>for a better tomorrow,</i>

14:14.030 --> 14:14.990
<i>for a new world,</i>

14:15.870 --> 14:18.030
<i>and it begins here,</i>

14:19.470 --> 14:20.430
<i>in this...</i>

14:21.990 --> 14:22.950
city of hope.

14:25.350 --> 14:26.310
It starts here,

14:27.110 --> 14:28.070
<i>in Promise City.</i>

14:35.270 --> 14:36.590
I'd hate to have her job.

14:36.870 --> 14:38.470
Jordan Collier grabs
a chunk of seattle

14:38.590 --> 14:40.590
as his own personal fiefdom
under her watch.

14:40.710 --> 14:42.510
Not going to earn her any
brownie points in D.C.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.990
- No one could have seen that coming.
- Tom, we've got another.

14:45.070 --> 14:47.990
It's an earthquake in the Allegheny
mountains, just outside of Pittsburgh.

14:48.110 --> 14:49.670
5.2 on the Richter scale.

14:49.870 --> 14:51.270
Miles from the nearest
fault line.

14:51.590 --> 14:52.870
A tornado
outside Palm Springs,

14:52.950 --> 14:54.470
a warehouse explosion
in Jersey,

14:54.750 --> 14:56.790
a tsunami on lake Michigan.
Now this? Anyone hurt?

14:56.910 --> 14:59.590
No, just like the others,
property damage, but no injuries.

14:59.710 --> 15:02.030
Any closer to the city, though,
it would have been different.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.550
Collier's made a statement on the net.
He's claiming responsibility

15:04.670 --> 15:07.190
for all these mini-disasters.
He's calling them demonstrations.

15:07.270 --> 15:09.710
Just letting us know what will happen
if we move against him.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.350
I mean, God knows how many
people he has with abilities,

15:12.430 --> 15:14.710
scattered around the country
just waiting for his signal.

15:16.430 --> 15:17.390
<i>Hey, dad.</i>

15:20.830 --> 15:21.790
Hey, Kyle.

15:22.350 --> 15:24.390
<i>- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

15:26.510 --> 15:28.550
All right, good.
Now, here's what I want you to do.

15:28.630 --> 15:30.550
You go to the perimeter,
you walk across,

15:30.670 --> 15:32.870
and you surrender to
the first NTAC agent you see.

15:33.510 --> 15:34.950
Dad, I'm where I need to be.

15:35.070 --> 15:36.710
Things could get
really ugly down there.

15:36.790 --> 15:38.270
<i>Make sure that doesn't happen.</i>

15:38.590 --> 15:40.910
Promise City has to succeed.
Everything depends on it.

15:41.030 --> 15:42.950
Is that what Jordan Collier's
been telling you?

15:43.830 --> 15:45.430
Actually,
that's what I'm telling him.

15:45.870 --> 15:47.670
You're some kind of
advisor to him now?

15:47.830 --> 15:48.790
Something like that.

15:48.870 --> 15:50.830
Then advise him
to end this thing right now!

15:50.990 --> 15:53.590
I can't do that, okay? I know
this is coming at you really fast,

15:53.670 --> 15:56.270
<i>but you got to hear me out.
There's this book. It's a prophecy.</i>

15:56.350 --> 15:57.950
<i>This ability that I have
led me to it.</i>

15:59.110 --> 16:01.670
<i>This ability of yours,
you still haven't  told me what it is.</i>

16:03.030 --> 16:04.070
It's complicated.

16:05.710 --> 16:06.950
It tells me what to do.

16:07.830 --> 16:09.350
It...
What's important,

16:10.110 --> 16:11.990
and this book is important, dad.
I mean...

16:12.270 --> 16:14.670
It's almost 100 years old,
but it talks about the 4400,

16:14.790 --> 16:16.150
promicin, everything, and...

16:16.230 --> 16:17.870
Dad, it explains
what needs to happen

16:18.070 --> 16:20.230
<i>for paradise
to come to earth,</i>

16:20.510 --> 16:22.150
<i>and Promise City's
where it all starts.</i>

16:22.270 --> 16:24.830
<i>once people see what we can do here,
they're gonna want to be a part of it.</i>

16:24.910 --> 16:27.390
<i>Once that happens, according to the book
once everyone's taken promicin...</i>

16:29.030 --> 16:30.470
I don't know
how else to say it.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.910
God is going to show his face.

16:34.830 --> 16:36.390
It'll be heaven on earth.

16:41.710 --> 16:42.670
Are you still there?

16:44.270 --> 16:45.230
Yeah, I'm here.

16:47.510 --> 16:48.510
Wait...

16:49.750 --> 16:51.470
Kyle, think about
what you're saying.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.510
If everyone in the world
takes this shot,

16:53.630 --> 16:54.950
half of them are going to die.

16:55.350 --> 16:57.750
<i>You're talking paradise
at the cost of genocide.</i>

16:57.830 --> 16:59.950
Dad, the world is falling apart.

17:00.030 --> 17:02.190
<i>Okay, Promise City
has to succeed.</i>

17:02.310 --> 17:03.790
<i>You can't let them
destroy it.</i>

17:03.910 --> 17:05.190
Listen, Kyle, just...

17:05.470 --> 17:06.430
can we just...

17:07.950 --> 17:09.190
can we talk in person?

17:09.950 --> 17:10.950
I mean, come home.

17:13.030 --> 17:14.470
I am home, dad.

17:16.589 --> 17:17.630
I'll talk to you soon.

17:24.550 --> 17:26.510
Shawn, I thought
you were smarter than this.

17:26.589 --> 17:28.349
I mean, are you really
that surprised?

17:28.670 --> 17:29.870
I saved
your mother's life...

17:29.950 --> 17:31.550
And I will always
be grateful for that.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.990
My mother was sick
for three years.

17:34.070 --> 17:36.230
My parents went through
their entire life savings.

17:36.350 --> 17:38.310
They gave me enough money
to get my parents out of debt

17:38.390 --> 17:40.710
- and start a life for myself, too.
- They? Who's they?

17:40.830 --> 17:41.790
Lawyers.

17:43.870 --> 17:45.390
From back east, I think.

17:45.510 --> 17:48.590
All I know is that they promised
to take care of me, and they delivered.

17:49.190 --> 17:51.150
You sold me out for money.

17:52.190 --> 17:54.350
People need you.
They need what you can do.

17:54.470 --> 17:56.830
It doesn't really matter
if you get elected or not.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.030
You saying that because I'm a 4400,
what you did is okay.

18:01.270 --> 18:02.630
I had to look out for myself.

18:05.590 --> 18:06.870
I'm not special like you.

18:06.990 --> 18:09.030
I had to look out for myself,
so I did.

18:14.670 --> 18:15.710
He sounded rational,

18:15.830 --> 18:18.030
but the things that were
coming out of his mouth...

18:18.430 --> 18:20.270
Heaven on earth,
the face of God?

18:20.630 --> 18:23.870
I'd like to see this book he's talking
about. Just read the prophecy.

18:24.110 --> 18:25.110
And then what?

18:25.230 --> 18:27.310
You know, take the shot
and hope you survive,

18:27.390 --> 18:28.830
and then join Collier
in paradise?

18:29.070 --> 18:31.710
Come on, what happened to
Diana Skouris, professional skeptic?

18:32.350 --> 18:33.390
Well, you know, Tom,

18:33.870 --> 18:35.470
my daughter sees the future.

18:36.070 --> 18:39.630
We just have to consider the possibility
that there could be something to this.

18:39.910 --> 18:40.870
That's all.

18:43.950 --> 18:45.470
What the hell?

18:47.230 --> 18:48.710
So this is D.C.'s big plan?

18:48.790 --> 18:50.990
Send in a hit squad
to take out Jordan Collier?

18:51.110 --> 18:53.310
With all due respect, Ma'am,
we're not a hit squad.

18:53.470 --> 18:55.470
But you're not exactly trained
to arrest people, are you?

18:55.590 --> 18:59.070
Jordan collier is in open rebellion
against the government.

18:59.350 --> 19:00.870
He seized U.S. territory,

19:00.950 --> 19:03.190
declared himself
above the law.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.710
What do you suggest we do,

19:04.830 --> 19:07.030
wipe his nose
and read him a bedtime story?

19:07.150 --> 19:08.550
Those are our options?

19:08.630 --> 19:10.830
A bedtime story
or a bullet to the head?

19:10.910 --> 19:13.550
I was told to send in my guys,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

19:13.670 --> 19:15.470
What makes you think
you could even get close to him?

19:15.590 --> 19:17.230
We appreciate the concern, Ma'am...

19:27.390 --> 19:28.950
but I think we can handle things.

19:29.150 --> 19:30.630
The enhanced soldier program.

19:31.190 --> 19:32.470
That's still in operation?

19:32.630 --> 19:35.430
The department of defense
considers it a top priority.

19:47.470 --> 19:50.030
Maia, what do you mean,
I have to save Jordan Collier?

19:50.150 --> 19:53.110
<i>The soldiers. They're going
to kill him. I saw it.</i>

19:53.390 --> 19:54.350
And when they do,

19:54.470 --> 19:56.270
something terrible's going to happen.

19:56.390 --> 19:57.470
Terrible?

19:57.910 --> 19:59.310
Maia, what did you see?

19:59.670 --> 20:01.470
It was just... black.

20:01.870 --> 20:03.110
What, you mean the vision ended?

20:03.230 --> 20:05.150
<i>No,
I was still having the vision,</i>

20:05.510 --> 20:07.510
but it was like
I wasn't there anymore.

20:07.830 --> 20:08.870
No one was.

20:09.390 --> 20:11.950
<i>Please, mom,
you can't let Jordan Collier die.</i>

20:12.070 --> 20:14.470
Maia, I'll do what I can.

20:14.750 --> 20:15.830
<i>I promise.</i>

20:17.470 --> 20:18.510
I know you will.

20:29.990 --> 20:31.270
What are you doing out here?

20:31.910 --> 20:33.270
Cassie said
I needed to wait here,

20:33.390 --> 20:35.150
so I'm waiting.

20:36.390 --> 20:38.630
I was thinking
maybe you could ask Cassie

20:39.510 --> 20:41.270
what my role is in all this?

20:41.830 --> 20:42.990
You're part of it.

20:43.630 --> 20:44.710
I know that much.

20:45.270 --> 20:46.390
She told you that?

20:47.030 --> 20:48.630
She tells me what she wants
to tell me.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.270
And you just do what she says?

20:52.310 --> 20:53.550
Does that bother you?

20:55.350 --> 20:57.230
I guess it's just
a matter of faith, you know.

20:57.870 --> 20:59.670
That's what Promise City
is all about.

21:00.190 --> 21:01.270
Faith.

21:01.910 --> 21:03.390
Belief. Hope.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.910
<i>Hey, get back here!</i>

21:06.070 --> 21:08.550
Kyle, I think
something's happening.

21:12.110 --> 21:14.470
We got a report that someone
managed to get past police lines

21:14.590 --> 21:17.310
and enter Promise City. One of the
dashboard cameras got some video.

21:26.310 --> 21:27.990
Oh, my God!

21:28.030 --> 21:30.470
Maia?
Why aren't you picking this up?

21:30.830 --> 21:32.950
You get this message,
you call me back immediately!

21:33.070 --> 21:34.470
Maybe she didn't take
her cell phone with her.

21:34.590 --> 21:35.910
Maybe they took it away from her.

21:36.030 --> 21:37.870
Jordan's not going to
hurt her, Diana.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.910
Maia went in there to warn him
about the soldiers.

21:40.030 --> 21:41.470
She has an ability
he'd love to have access to.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.710
If anything, he's probably
treating her like a queen.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.390
Maia's vision ended in darkness.
That has never happened before.

21:46.510 --> 21:48.950
We have got to go in there
and get Kyle and Maia to safety.

21:49.070 --> 21:50.590
Well, how do we get past
the beacons?

21:50.950 --> 21:52.750
Aquino and his men
seem pretty damn confident

21:52.870 --> 21:54.390
they can get through.
We go with them.

21:54.550 --> 21:56.270
It's a military operation, Diana.

21:56.630 --> 21:59.070
Lawton's not going to let
two NTAC agents just tag along.

21:59.470 --> 22:00.790
Then we don't ask for permission.

22:04.310 --> 22:06.230
I was born three years ago.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.790
So that makes you, what,
nine years older than me?

22:09.150 --> 22:10.190
Almost ten.

22:13.030 --> 22:14.870
I litterally grew up overnight,
I didn't...

22:15.510 --> 22:17.190
understand
what it meant to be an adult.

22:19.070 --> 22:20.550
You did a lot of bad things.

22:21.270 --> 22:23.550
I was told they were... necessary.

22:24.550 --> 22:25.630
Important.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.310
But that doesn't
make it right, does it?

22:30.430 --> 22:32.350
No. It doesn't.

22:32.950 --> 22:35.990
So what I'm trying to say
is that I'm sorry for scaring you,

22:36.630 --> 22:38.390
and for hurting
people you care about.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.470
Some things are so bad...

22:42.830 --> 22:45.190
saying sorry just isn't enough.

22:48.590 --> 22:49.710
I know.

22:51.790 --> 22:53.110
Maia Skouris.

22:54.190 --> 22:55.510
Welcome to Promise City.

22:57.070 --> 22:59.350
I understand you have
something to talk to me about.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.150
I need to ask you something.

23:03.430 --> 23:04.630
Are you a good guy

23:05.310 --> 23:06.270
or a bad guy?

23:06.670 --> 23:08.590
My mom can't seem to
make up her mind.

23:08.750 --> 23:09.830
I get that a lot.

23:15.270 --> 23:16.350
I'll tell you what.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.230
I have something
I want to show you.

23:19.910 --> 23:21.550
Then you can make up
your own mind.

23:27.110 --> 23:29.110
<i>Yesterday, I promised you miracles.</i>

23:29.430 --> 23:31.230
<i>Today, I'll show you one.</i>

23:31.910 --> 23:33.350
This is the Duwamish river delta.

23:33.470 --> 23:35.070
It's one of the most
polluted waterways

23:35.390 --> 23:36.630
in all of America.

23:36.710 --> 23:38.630
It's loaded
with cancer-causing chemicals,

23:38.750 --> 23:41.270
pcbs, toxic levels of mercury.

23:41.590 --> 23:42.670
<i>It's a blight.</i>

23:42.870 --> 23:44.030
<i>Anastasia?</i>

23:45.150 --> 23:47.390
<i>Anastasia took promicin</i>

23:47.790 --> 23:49.950
<i>when her fiance was killed
in a car accident.</i>

23:50.910 --> 23:52.230
<i>I'm sure you'll agree</i>

23:52.710 --> 23:54.590
<i>she's developed
a remarkable ability.</i>

24:40.550 --> 24:42.190
Now, that's what a river
should look like.

24:49.230 --> 24:50.870
<i>And that's the way
river should taste.</i>

24:51.670 --> 24:54.070
<i>Come on in.
the water's fine.</i>

25:04.510 --> 25:05.470
So, Maia,

25:07.150 --> 25:08.670
now do you think
I'm a good guy

25:08.950 --> 25:10.070
or a bad guy?

25:13.830 --> 25:16.110
Soldiers... with abilities.

25:17.030 --> 25:18.270
They'll be here soon.

25:19.470 --> 25:20.790
They're coming to kill you.

25:25.470 --> 25:27.590
As much as I like to hear
I was right,

25:27.710 --> 25:29.630
it's not going to make
a bit of difference.

25:29.750 --> 25:31.430
Yesterday, you said
that we could deal with this.

25:31.550 --> 25:32.910
The sex scandal, sure,

25:33.110 --> 25:34.790
but Jordan Collier?

25:34.870 --> 25:36.470
This whole Promise City thing?

25:36.590 --> 25:37.830
That we can't get around.

25:37.950 --> 25:39.990
My position
on Jordan is very clear.

25:40.110 --> 25:42.830
I publicly condemned the man
for handing out promicin.

25:42.950 --> 25:45.710
Your whole campaign was constructed
around one concept...

25:45.830 --> 25:49.030
Yes, a middle path
for both 4400s and non-4400s,

25:49.150 --> 25:51.110
one you sold to me,
one I still believe in.

25:51.230 --> 25:53.030
There is no middle path now.

25:53.150 --> 25:54.910
Collier just blew it all up.

25:55.030 --> 25:56.070
Promise City.

25:56.270 --> 25:57.270
Miracles.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.550
We can't compete with that.

26:00.390 --> 26:01.390
So that's it?

26:01.990 --> 26:04.070
You're telling me to just drop out
of the race.

26:04.190 --> 26:05.750
I'm telling you you can't win.

26:59.550 --> 27:01.470
Henders, it's your show.

27:06.110 --> 27:07.310
He's east of here.

27:07.710 --> 27:08.870
Maybe ten blocks.

27:20.030 --> 27:21.430
Those guys get
all the good tricks.

27:21.550 --> 27:23.510
Just be glad Aquino can only
do that camouflage thing

27:23.630 --> 27:25.190
when they're standing still.
We would've lost them

27:25.310 --> 27:26.590
the minute they got over there.

27:36.290 --> 27:37.850
Diana, slow down.
We don't want to get too close.

27:37.970 --> 27:40.410
- I don't want to lose them
- What the hell are you two doing?

27:43.130 --> 27:45.610
Captain, we're not here to interfere
with your mission, okay?

27:45.690 --> 27:48.850
My daughter, she's inside Promise City.
I just want to get her out.

27:48.970 --> 27:51.210
You two get caught,
things get a lot messier for us.

27:51.290 --> 27:52.770
Surrender your weapons,
I'm going to cuff you,

27:52.890 --> 27:54.370
And we'll pick you up
on the way out.

27:54.570 --> 27:56.210
You obviously don't have children.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.130
I said surrender your weapon!

28:01.250 --> 28:02.250
Diana, run!

28:22.290 --> 28:24.370
Okay, that's not good.

28:25.930 --> 28:27.050
Look, I know you're here.

28:27.690 --> 28:28.890
You can't move when you hide.

28:37.330 --> 28:38.490
So I won't hide.

29:14.090 --> 29:15.210
Aren't you sneaky?

29:22.250 --> 29:23.490
10:00 a.m. in the garden.

29:23.890 --> 29:25.810
Good.
Yeah, that works, thanks.

29:26.370 --> 29:28.490
Okay, now we work on
your withdrawal speech.

29:28.610 --> 29:30.850
The important thing is,
you go out with your head held high.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.970
Shawn, there's some
reporters downstairs.

29:33.090 --> 29:35.530
Tell them we'll have the press
conference tomorrow morning.

29:38.690 --> 29:41.130
I'll see them now.
I have some things that I want to say.

29:46.370 --> 29:47.370
Mr. Farrell!

29:47.610 --> 29:49.410
What's your relationship
with Kara Sarkestian?

29:49.530 --> 29:51.130
You receive sexual favors
for healing her mother?

29:51.210 --> 29:52.890
Are you in contact
with Jordan Collier?

29:53.010 --> 29:54.570
Please, please.
First of all,

29:54.690 --> 29:56.610
in spite of my ability to heal,

29:56.730 --> 29:58.250
I am a normal person,

29:58.370 --> 30:00.730
and that means
that I make mistakes.

30:01.290 --> 30:03.010
Obviously,
I made one the other night.

30:03.130 --> 30:04.690
I regret
that my misjudgment

30:04.810 --> 30:07.970
as distracted from
the real issues of my campaign.

30:08.490 --> 30:10.530
Right now as you all know
Jordan Collier is creating

30:10.650 --> 30:13.650
his own separate society in a place
that he calls Promise City,

30:13.770 --> 30:14.970
further widening the divide

30:15.090 --> 30:17.410
between people with abilities
and people without.

30:17.770 --> 30:19.530
He says that he's here
to heal the world,

30:20.850 --> 30:23.530
but what he's doing threatens
to tear everything apart,

30:24.130 --> 30:25.810
which is why
I have no choice

30:26.210 --> 30:27.850
but to continue my campaign,

30:28.410 --> 30:31.410
to continue to be a voice
for unity and cooperation,

30:32.010 --> 30:34.050
and to provide a middle path

30:34.730 --> 30:36.330
that we can all walk together.

30:39.490 --> 30:41.370
- I will answer those questions.
- Mr. Farell...

30:41.490 --> 30:43.410
Senator Lenhoff, are you
still backing Mr. Farrell?

30:43.530 --> 30:44.530
You bet I am!

30:44.650 --> 30:46.170
Shawn, can we get
another statement!

30:53.090 --> 30:54.130
Hey, mommy.

30:54.570 --> 30:56.010
Oh, Maia,

30:56.770 --> 30:58.450
I was so worried about you.

30:58.850 --> 30:59.850
I'm sorry.

31:00.010 --> 31:01.770
I had to warn Jordan.

31:02.010 --> 31:03.010
Jordan?

31:03.330 --> 31:05.130
It's Jordan now?

31:06.690 --> 31:07.850
This place, mom.

31:07.970 --> 31:10.570
They're doing
all kinds of great stuff.

31:11.410 --> 31:12.770
You should see it.

31:13.730 --> 31:14.890
Some other time.

31:15.610 --> 31:16.690
We're leaving.

31:17.090 --> 31:18.570
- Now.
- No.

31:19.810 --> 31:20.770
No?

31:21.090 --> 31:22.490
What do you mean, "no"?

31:23.010 --> 31:24.090
We can't.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.610
We have to stay here.

31:28.090 --> 31:29.450
It's safer that way.

31:40.530 --> 31:41.690
Bad day, huh, dad?

31:42.210 --> 31:43.210
I've had better.

31:44.210 --> 31:45.410
You going to cut me loose?

31:54.610 --> 31:55.770
So now what?

31:56.890 --> 31:58.050
We go see Jordan.

32:22.850 --> 32:25.010
Gentlemen, you're trespassing.

32:56.410 --> 32:58.530
Are you sure
you won't reconsider?

32:58.690 --> 33:00.610
You could join us,
keep your ability.

33:01.530 --> 33:02.890
That's not going to happen.

33:04.370 --> 33:05.450
No, I suppose not.

33:29.930 --> 33:33.330
It pains me
to see gifts like yours wasted.

33:42.010 --> 33:44.090
Make sure they're escorted
out of Promise City.

33:45.450 --> 33:46.410
Collier, wait.

33:47.170 --> 33:48.250
This isn't going to end.

33:48.370 --> 33:49.770
You've painted a huge bullseye
on this place.

33:49.890 --> 33:51.370
The government's going
to keep coming after you.

33:51.490 --> 33:54.210
Then I'll just have to show them
what a very bad idea that is.

34:05.570 --> 34:06.890
Just... wait.

34:07.210 --> 34:08.650
Maybe I wasn't clear.

34:09.530 --> 34:10.610
You are free to go.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.530
Maia, you can come back anytime.

34:13.730 --> 34:16.250
You can even stay here a while
if that's all right with your mother.

34:16.370 --> 34:18.610
Play sleepover in a war zone?
I don't think so.

34:18.730 --> 34:20.730
Sending in those soldiers,
it was a bad idea,

34:21.130 --> 34:22.730
but don't make things worse
by retaliating.

34:22.850 --> 34:24.090
People you work for
are the problem.

34:24.210 --> 34:25.290
They need to learn
to leave us alone.

34:25.409 --> 34:26.610
Your son has a point.

34:26.730 --> 34:27.969
You've promised
the world miracles.

34:28.090 --> 34:29.210
You've even shown us some,

34:29.409 --> 34:31.370
but no one's going to remember
that once you start killing people.

34:31.489 --> 34:33.889
When people start dying,
it's a war.

34:34.010 --> 34:35.610
No matter how powerful
you think you are,

34:35.770 --> 34:37.570
when it's war, you lose.

34:38.090 --> 34:39.210
Don't be so sure.

34:40.250 --> 34:41.409
My mom is right.

34:44.489 --> 34:45.610
If there's a war,

34:46.889 --> 34:48.210
everyone loses.

34:53.690 --> 34:54.810
You saw this?

34:55.610 --> 34:56.570
Just now,

34:57.250 --> 34:58.410
while you were talking.

35:01.370 --> 35:02.410
Please,

35:02.930 --> 35:05.090
you have to listen to my mother.

35:07.050 --> 35:08.330
So, what do you think, Kyle?

35:09.170 --> 35:10.490
Did Maia get through to Collier?

35:10.970 --> 35:12.650
Will he hold off any reprisals?

35:12.810 --> 35:14.690
He's going to do
what he thinks is right,

35:15.450 --> 35:17.450
but he won't hurt anybody
if he doesn't have to.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.810
I guess you can make it
the rest of the way on your own.

35:21.130 --> 35:23.050
I'll turn off the beacon
so you can cross.

35:23.170 --> 35:24.370
Kyle, come with me.

35:24.850 --> 35:26.290
It could be your last chance.

35:27.530 --> 35:28.730
You never give up, do you?

35:28.850 --> 35:31.010
No, and I never will.

35:33.050 --> 35:35.290
That book I told you about?
The prophecy?

35:36.090 --> 35:37.810
Heaven on earth.
Yeah, I remember.

35:38.290 --> 35:40.370
Well, in the book,
there's a list of 200 names.

35:41.010 --> 35:43.730
People who can take promicin
and are guaranteed to survive.

35:44.370 --> 35:47.330
The last name on
that list is you, dad.

35:48.490 --> 35:50.130
So, what are you trying
to say, Kyle?

35:51.050 --> 35:53.850
I'm destined to take promicin
because it says so in some book?

35:55.410 --> 35:57.770
I'm just saying
you're a very important person.

36:00.210 --> 36:01.410
And not just to me.

36:09.370 --> 36:10.570
I gotta go.

36:35.570 --> 36:36.770
I don't know about you,

36:37.970 --> 36:39.770
but I'm exhausted.

36:40.210 --> 36:42.370
Yeah, I'm pretty tired, too.

36:46.730 --> 36:47.810
This war,

36:48.530 --> 36:50.290
the one that
you told Collier about,

36:52.010 --> 36:53.730
what exactly did you see?

36:55.250 --> 36:56.330
Actually...

36:57.130 --> 36:58.530
I didn't see anything.

36:59.850 --> 37:00.890
Sweetheart,

37:01.490 --> 37:02.770
it doesn't matter
how bad it is.

37:02.890 --> 37:04.570
You can tell me,
because I need to know.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.450
No, mom, I mean...

37:06.810 --> 37:08.410
I didn't see anything.

37:09.010 --> 37:10.610
I didn't have a vision.

37:11.530 --> 37:12.610
I lied.

37:15.130 --> 37:16.130
Why?

37:17.450 --> 37:20.010
Well, I didn't want
Jordan to hurt anyone,

37:20.490 --> 37:23.250
and he wasn't listening to you.

37:24.930 --> 37:26.250
And you knew he'd listen to you?

37:27.050 --> 37:28.290
I hoped he would.

37:29.570 --> 37:30.810
I hope he did, too.

37:33.810 --> 37:34.810
You know, mom,

37:35.570 --> 37:37.650
Jordan's not a bad person.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.250
I think he's...

37:42.130 --> 37:43.610
one of the good guys.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.170
Well,
if he's one of the good guys,

37:48.050 --> 37:49.290
what does that make me?

37:56.650 --> 37:57.810
This is Skouris.

37:59.370 --> 38:00.330
Be right there.

38:13.850 --> 38:15.050
How long have they been there?

38:15.210 --> 38:17.210
They started gathering
about 20 minutes ago.

38:18.010 --> 38:19.370
All right, here comes Collier...

38:23.850 --> 38:25.010
and Kyle's with him.

38:25.410 --> 38:26.610
And Isabelle Tyler.

38:30.130 --> 38:32.450
I thought you said no one could get
close to those beacons.

38:32.770 --> 38:35.010
Someone must be shielding them
from the effects.

38:50.610 --> 38:52.130
They're moving the perimeter.

38:53.170 --> 38:54.730
That's Collier's reprisal.

38:55.490 --> 38:57.010
He's expanding Promise City.

38:57.490 --> 38:59.690
So, what's he saying?
The more we move against him,

39:00.050 --> 39:01.370
the more land he's going to take.

39:01.490 --> 39:04.410
Today south Seattle,
tomorrow what, the world?

40:15.490 --> 40:17.370
That's twice
as bigger as it was before.
