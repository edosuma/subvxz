00:25.760 --> 00:27.285
(Russell, voiceover)
<i>They</i> say courage <i>is found</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:29.010
<i>in unlikely places.</i>

00:29.920 --> 00:32.491
<i>This is the story of
how I conquered my fears</i>

00:32.560 --> 00:34.847
<i>to become part of the greatest
tag team wrestling duo</i>

00:34.920 --> 00:36.365
<i>of all time.</i>

00:36.920 --> 00:38.968
<i>And finally got
what I always wanted...</i>

00:39.880 --> 00:40.881
<i>a family.</i>

00:41.920 --> 00:43.809
<i>Oh, no, that's not me.</i>

00:44.920 --> 00:46.490
<i>That's me, Russell.</i>

00:46.560 --> 00:48.085
<i>The Jack Russell Terrier.</i>

00:49.600 --> 00:51.011
<i>Every story begins somewhere.</i>

00:52.440 --> 00:54.169
<i>And every dog has his day.</i>

00:55.280 --> 00:57.886
<i>Some would say I come
from humble beginnings.</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:01.331
<i>We'd spend our days vying
for the attention of kids</i>

01:01.400 --> 01:03.721
<i>to take us home and make us
part of their families.</i>

01:04.760 --> 01:07.923
<i>There was me. I used
to be a real scaredy-dog.</i>

01:08.800 --> 01:10.245
(soft barking)

01:11.800 --> 01:13.040
This is Russell.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.400
Aw, he's so cute.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.481
- Oh, pee pee.
- Oh, sorry.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.281
Russell doesn't usually do this.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.203
He's normally a very
sweet puppy if you just...

01:29.560 --> 01:30.766
Just give him a chance.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.365
<i>(Russell, voiceover)
What he really meant was:</i>

01:32.440 --> 01:33.885
<i>I always did this.</i>

01:33.960 --> 01:37.885
Oh... Russell, you have to stop
peeing on all the customers.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.200
Or you'll never find a family.

01:39.280 --> 01:40.805
What are you scared of, anyway?

01:40.880 --> 01:42.211
(Russell, voiceover)
<i>It</i> was a good question.

01:42.280 --> 01:45.170
<i>That was just the way I was.
And the way I figured it,</i>

01:45.480 --> 01:47.608
<i>I was going to stay
that way forever.</i>

01:52.080 --> 01:53.286
(whines softly)

02:00.200 --> 02:03.363
<i>But little did I know,
my luck was about to change,</i>

02:03.440 --> 02:05.920
<i>when the Ferraro family
moved back to Portland.</i>

02:06.000 --> 02:07.968
- Here we are.
- Great!

02:14.400 --> 02:15.481
Well, this is it.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.650
<i>(Russell, voiceover)
That's Nate, Colleen,</i>

02:18.720 --> 02:21.246
<i>their son, Max
and daughter, Lena.</i>

02:21.600 --> 02:23.602
<i>And that's the legendary,
totally awesome,</i>

02:23.680 --> 02:25.364
<i>Ferraro Wrestling arena.</i>

02:25.440 --> 02:26.851
Amazing!

02:28.080 --> 02:29.161
- Oh!
- Whoa!

02:30.040 --> 02:31.405
Here we go.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.086
(Colleen) Whoa!

02:33.160 --> 02:34.685
(Nate coughing)

02:39.200 --> 02:40.326
Wow!

02:40.520 --> 02:43.091
Max, wait for us
before you go inside.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.241
Wow!

03:01.800 --> 03:04.610
"The strongest tag team
is family."

03:04.800 --> 03:05.801
Hmm.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.525
<i>'</i> (fizzling)
- Ooh!

03:20.080 --> 03:21.491
This place rocks.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.291
If you like the Stone Age.

03:23.360 --> 03:25.840
And the greatest
wrestler of all time.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.242
The great Maximiliano
Ferraro II enters...

03:29.320 --> 03:31.243
Okay, I know this
sounds crazy, but

03:31.320 --> 03:34.563
I can feel your Papa
Maximiliano's presence here.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.206
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.005
Maximiliano bounces
off the ropes

03:39.080 --> 03:41.481
and takes the evil Crusher
down with a clothes line.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.767
I wish we could just
give the building a face lift

03:43.840 --> 03:48.084
- and flip it, you know?
- Oh, no, no. It's so nostalgic.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.764
What's "stolgic"?

03:49.840 --> 03:51.171
Yeah. See.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.004
He pits the Crusher and...

03:54.080 --> 03:55.445
Come on, Nate.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.251
We're finally going to get some
quality family time, remember?

03:58.320 --> 04:00.687
No more 12-hour-days
at the office.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.040
He wins the belt!

04:02.120 --> 04:03.565
He did it!

04:07.120 --> 04:08.884
(Colleen) Max, honey.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.646
Okay.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.804
(Nate) Looks exactly how
I remember it as a kid.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.645
Well, your papa definitely
had a particular taste.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.131
Yeah, it's called
"mid-century Guido".

04:31.360 --> 04:32.441
Remember,

04:33.560 --> 04:37.326
all Papa said
in his will was... yes...

04:37.400 --> 04:38.765
"Return our profit
within one year

04:38.880 --> 04:40.484
and the building is
ours to sell."

04:40.560 --> 04:42.085
Then we can all go
back to San Diego,

04:42.160 --> 04:44.128
and forget that this
ever happened.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.169
"Ferraro Wrestling."

05:30.200 --> 05:31.690
You dropped your dolly.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.211
Where did you get that?

05:41.280 --> 05:43.089
I think it's the monkey's.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.809
Lena, when are
you going to grow up?

05:49.240 --> 05:51.208
I'm only six and a half, Max.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.282
I see you found
the costume room.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.600
I knew it wouldn't take you
too long.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.801
Mm-hmm.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.847
My grandma taught me to sew
on a machine just like this.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.331
I never thought I'd get
to use them again.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.765
They don't make them anymore.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.210
These old costumes
are pretty great.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.449
(gasps) What?

06:23.440 --> 06:25.647
Now that was a tiny wrestler.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.006
Cute.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.411
I'm going to check on the kids.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.641
Okay.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.203
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.805
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.247
You don't want him unless
you get covered in...

06:49.280 --> 06:50.441
Come on, honey, let's go.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.245
- Derek take him.
- Sure, boss.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.766
Come here, little guy.
It is okay. You're okay.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.441
Guess what?
It's Russell's anniversary.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.682
He's no longer a puppy,
which means

07:03.760 --> 07:05.250
he's pound bound.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.806
Oh, boy, you're in trouble.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.245
What's the pound?

07:09.320 --> 07:12.403
It's a place where rejects go,
because no family wants them.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.244
No family wants me?

07:14.320 --> 07:16.084
But that's all I want,
is a family.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.685
Russell, if I were you,

07:17.760 --> 07:20.001
I'd get out of here
as fast as I could.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.446
You got to give him
another chance.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.681
(sighs) Let's face it.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.286
Russell's the runt and he's had
way too many chances already.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.249
Then I will take him.
Look...

07:27.320 --> 07:29.288
I can't let him
end up at the pound.

08:01.720 --> 08:05.008
- Hey, buddy. You all settled in?
- Yeah.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.320
- Where did you get that?
- Lena found it.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.166
Okay. Can I see?

08:16.360 --> 08:18.567
You know, I haven't seen
this since I was your age.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.283
The original <i>ll</i> Maniac
gave this to me.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.488
I used to play with him
all the time.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.449
Yeah, front flips, back flips,

08:26.520 --> 08:30.161
body slams, right?
I had so many cool moves.

08:31.640 --> 08:32.801
Here you go.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.366
- You keep him safe, he's yours now.
- Really?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.160
Of course.

08:44.680 --> 08:48.082
- What's this?
- It says "Ferraro Wrestling".

08:48.720 --> 08:50.006
No way.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.085
Wow.

08:55.160 --> 08:59.324
You know, Papa Maximiliano
started this whole place with

08:59.400 --> 09:02.006
nothing more than
passion and a dream.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.041
Who's the monkey?

09:08.040 --> 09:10.361
Old Maximiliano was
an interesting character

09:10.440 --> 09:12.363
and that was his monkey, Hunk.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.169
He referred to him
as his partner.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.281
Like a mascot?

09:16.080 --> 09:18.003
Yeah. Kind of.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.204
What was it like back then?

09:22.920 --> 09:25.969
Back in its heyday,
in a time called the '80s,

09:26.040 --> 09:29.487
<i>the Ferraro Wrestling
Arena was the place to</i> be...

09:29.560 --> 09:33.360
Welcome fans, to Thursday Night
Mayhem at Ferraro Wrestling.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.329
I'm so excited,
I'm like a kernel

09:35.400 --> 09:36.811
<i>- Popcorn, 'H'? - about to...</i>

09:36.880 --> 09:38.689
Don't mind if I do, Mike.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.764
We had the best talent in town.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.771
But none were better
than <i>ll</i> Maniac.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.286
- <i>Il</i> Maniac!
- (Cheering)

09:54.360 --> 09:56.328
(crowd)
Whoa! Ooh!

09:56.400 --> 09:58.607
(cheering)

10:06.040 --> 10:07.405
(cheering) (whooping)

10:20.920 --> 10:24.686
(TJ) <i>ll</i> Maniac is still
the heavy weight champ.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.364
<i>(Nate)
He really did have it all.</i>

10:26.440 --> 10:28.488
<i>The talent, fans...</i>

10:29.520 --> 10:30.601
everything.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.926
- What happened?
- Mick Vaughn came to town.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.450
<i>Mick wanted to buy us,
along with all the other</i>

10:38.520 --> 10:40.443
<i>wrestling businesses
on the West Coast.</i>

10:40.520 --> 10:43.524
<i>He called it "WUF".</i>

10:43.600 --> 10:46.444
<i>The Wrestlers United Federation.</i>

10:46.520 --> 10:48.409
<i>And Papa Maximiliano,</i>

10:48.480 --> 10:51.609
<i>he wanted to preserve Ferraro
Wrestling as a family business</i>

10:51.680 --> 10:53.409
<i>for generations to come.</i>

10:54.520 --> 10:57.683
<i>But, pretty soon Papa couldn't
afford to pay the wrestlers.</i>

10:57.800 --> 11:01.486
<i>It was like the mat was
pulled out from underneath us.</i>

11:13.560 --> 11:17.451
<i>My dad knew it was</i> a <i>sinking
ship and he moved us</i> away.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.244
<i>Losing the business Papa could
handle, but losing his family...</i>

11:23.520 --> 11:24.931
<i>it broke his heart.</i>

11:30.240 --> 11:33.289
Dad, we can bring
Ferraro Wrestling

11:33.360 --> 11:34.646
back to its glory days.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.085
No, buddy, it's...

11:37.440 --> 11:40.046
a different era now.
That bell has rung.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.483
But you always told me,
just because you lost the round,

11:43.560 --> 11:45.528
does not mean
you lost the match.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.647
Okay, that's...
That's true, but...

11:49.600 --> 11:51.682
Yeah, let's just put this away.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.966
Okay.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.447
All right, my boys.
It's lights out.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.367
Good night.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.522
- Dad?
- Mm-hmm?

12:05.800 --> 12:08.690
Why did you name me
after Papa Maximiliano?

12:09.200 --> 12:10.725
Because guys named Max

12:10.800 --> 12:13.565
are always the best
guys to have in your corner.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.200
All right.
Some new pugs are moving in.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.442
So, it's time to go
to your new home.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.807
Oh, no,
he's taking me to the pound.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.450
I have to get out of here.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.527
What the heck?
Hey!

12:39.480 --> 12:41.050
- (brakes screech)
- (Russell yelps)

12:43.320 --> 12:44.924
What are you doing
with that dog?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.081
Russell!

12:48.680 --> 12:51.411
Hey, boss, what happened?

12:52.360 --> 12:54.124
- (catches breath)
- Where's Russell?

12:56.920 --> 12:59.764
I don't know why,
but that dog just bolted.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.406
What? But I just adopted him.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.050
I was going to take him home.

13:06.560 --> 13:10.281
I had a lead on
some local wrestlers

13:10.360 --> 13:12.522
that know how to draw a crowd.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.125
- Ooh!
- MmHmm.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.486
(man) Yodel-ay-hee-hoo?

13:15.560 --> 13:18.928
Hello, Dieter Das Mountain.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.604
<i>German accent)
Nein, Dieter Das Mountain.</i>

13:20.680 --> 13:22.284
- Oh, Dieter Das...
- Mountain.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.681
Mountain?
Oh, sorry about that.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.808
- Hi, I'm Nate Ferraro.
- Oh, hi.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.360
My name is Nate Ferraro

13:29.440 --> 13:32.046
- from the Ferraro Wrestling.
- What do you want?

13:32.120 --> 13:34.282
Yeah, how would you like
to wrestle

13:34.360 --> 13:36.010
- in a match...
- The classic arena.

13:36.080 --> 13:39.607
- ...at our classic arena?
- <i>Nein, I work</i> for <i>Mick</i> Vaughn.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.170
- Mick Vaughn?
- You know him?

13:41.240 --> 13:43.846
- I <i>know of him. Right.</i>
- <i>I will be blacklisted.</i>

13:43.920 --> 13:47.049
I totally understand. I wouldn't
want to be blacklisted either.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.122
- Blacklisted?
- Yodel-ay-hee-hoo.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.170
And a yodel-ay-hee-hoo,
to you too.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.490
So much for that.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.325
Wait, I have an idea.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.484
Scooch, scooch.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.010
Craigslist, Portland.

Wanted: Wrestlers.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.681
<i>Voila!</i>

14:11.720 --> 14:12.881
Yeah, I know, right?

14:13.600 --> 14:14.931
That is, like, so cool.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.088
Wait, you're Ferraro Wrestling?

14:17.160 --> 14:18.161
Yeah.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.168
You guys just re-opened, right?

14:21.240 --> 14:22.685
You guys should come Thursday.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.281
- (all muttering)
- I'm kind of busy.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.771
I can get you
guys free hot dogs.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.285
- Sure.
- Okay. I'll see you there.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.727
- See you there.
- Yeah, that sounds great.

14:31.720 --> 14:32.841
- Hot dogs!
- Yeah, hot dogs!

14:46.760 --> 14:49.127
Star light, star bright,

14:49.240 --> 14:51.368
first star I see tonight,

14:51.440 --> 14:54.125
I wish I may, I wish I might,

14:54.200 --> 14:55.964
have the wish, I wish tonight.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.850
Please help me find a family.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.681
I'll never leave you again,
ll Maniac.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.366
- Ah-hah!
- Ooh!

15:24.920 --> 15:26.206
It's you.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.285
I knew you were real.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.601
So, you got me, kid.
Now, what?

15:31.600 --> 15:32.965
You can talk!

15:34.120 --> 15:36.122
Wait till Max finds out.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.169
Whoa. Whoa.
Wait a second. Slow down.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.605
I'm just here to pick up
a friend.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.523
You never saw me.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.484
Not a chance.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.449
No one ever believes the kid.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.568
Everything's a negotiation.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.483
Everyone wants something.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.641
Name your price.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.486
Why do I get the feeling
I'm going to regret this?

15:57.960 --> 15:59.325
(liquid pouring)

16:03.240 --> 16:06.210
Would you like some
sugar with your tea, Mr. Hunk?

16:06.280 --> 16:09.682
How about two lumps
to the head, please?

16:16.720 --> 16:17.687
(belches)

16:17.800 --> 16:18.926
(laughs)

16:31.520 --> 16:32.646
Huh?

16:41.760 --> 16:45.446
Hello there. Who are you?

16:45.760 --> 16:49.481
- Uh, Russell.
- Hey, Russ, I'm Dozzo.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.608
What is that? A T-bone steak?

16:51.680 --> 16:53.967
Would you...
Would you like to share it?

16:54.040 --> 16:56.771
You see, Russ, this is my turf.

16:56.840 --> 17:00.606
Any food left out here
is rightfully yours truly.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.405
- Got it, mate?
- I guess so.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.211
I have a condition
called low blood sugar.

17:06.280 --> 17:10.171
I have to eat every few seconds,
or else I'll get "hangry".

17:10.240 --> 17:11.287
Hangry?

17:11.359 --> 17:13.328
You know,
when you get so hungry

17:13.400 --> 17:15.128
it makes you angry.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.406
HangrY-

17:19.800 --> 17:22.883
(angry voice) Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

17:22.960 --> 17:25.531
- Blimey!
- Step away from that steak!

17:25.599 --> 17:28.126
Or I'll take you to
school like a bus driver.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.645
I don't want any trouble, mate.

17:29.720 --> 17:34.442
Now scram! Beat it!
Vamoose! Cheerio!

17:43.080 --> 17:45.367
You got to learn to
stick up for yourself, kid.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.727
You can't let a bully dog
intimidate you like that.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.406
- Who are you?
- The name's Hunk.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.927
- What's yours, kid?
- I'm Russ. Russell.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.766
How did a nice kid like you end up
in the mean alleys of Portland?

17:57.920 --> 18:01.242
No one wanted me.
I was pound bound, so I escaped.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.561
A spunky runaway like me.

18:03.640 --> 18:05.051
Now eat up, kid.

18:05.120 --> 18:08.044
Speaking of food, it's banana time.
I got to split.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.086
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

18:10.160 --> 18:11.924
Uh, thanks, Mr. Hunk!

18:14.840 --> 18:16.604
<i>(N) We are back today!</i>

18:16.680 --> 18:19.524
<i>Twenty-five years later,
and nothing has changed.</i>

18:19.600 --> 18:23.810
In our first match we have
seasoned veteran, Vick Vice.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.326
(crowd booing)

18:26.400 --> 18:29.643
You know, Vick Vice is returning
from a sabbatical at Penn State.

18:29.720 --> 18:30.767
At Penn State.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.769
Mike, I think that's state pen.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.531
How about you, ref?
I'm gonna throw you out.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.170
- (grunting)
- (Screaming)

18:38.600 --> 18:41.046
- No, that's not right.
- Vick Vice in the house.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.169
And it looks like Vick
has been rehabilitated.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.366
Yeah.

18:45.440 --> 18:49.001
(Mike)
Facing Vick Vice is newcomer

18:49.080 --> 18:52.129
Brady Malibu!

18:52.920 --> 18:54.206
Maliboom!

18:54.320 --> 18:56.004
(Brady Malibu's
theme music plays)

19:00.600 --> 19:02.250
I wonder why they call him
Vick Vice?

19:02.320 --> 19:03.810
(groans)

19:06.560 --> 19:08.688
Well, now, I think that
answers that question.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.843
Dude! That's gnarly.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.206
No, no... What are you doing?
Get in the ring.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.406
I'm not fighting that dude.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.811
Did you see what he did
to that cinder block?

19:17.880 --> 19:19.848
- I thought you were a wrestler.
- Ah, swimsuit model,

19:19.920 --> 19:21.843
surfer, wrestler,
what's the diff?

19:21.920 --> 19:24.685
What's the diff?
It's actually a big difference.

19:24.760 --> 19:28.606
Fine, fine.
I will double your fee to 200.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.969
Three Bennies and I'll drop in
on the dude, Malibu style.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.366
- Sure, sure.
- Okay.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.761
One Benny, two Benny,
three Benny. Here you go.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.367
What?

19:44.920 --> 19:46.081
All right. Yeah.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.525
Go for it.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.446
Not the board.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.247
Oh!

19:57.920 --> 19:59.763
That was another
in the Vick Vice.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.803
- (booing)
- Boo to you!

20:05.160 --> 20:07.208
- Nice move!
- (Man) All right!

20:09.120 --> 20:10.531
All right, huh?

20:10.600 --> 20:12.125
Surfs up!

20:12.200 --> 20:14.487
- He's surfing.
- Hang loose, man. Yeah.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.689
(TJ) Brady Malibu
is hanging ten on Vick Vice.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.649
- That's two!
- All right.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.885
(Vice groaning)

20:21.960 --> 20:23.291
(TJ) Here is Vick Vice with

20:23.360 --> 20:26.045
- a massive spinning head slam!
- Okay.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.969
Yeah, that's going
to leave a mark.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.162
- Vice grip!
- Oh, here's the Vice grip.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.046
He's in trouble now.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.961
Oh, no.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.247
- Stop the fight!
- No, keep the match going.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.644
No, no. Stay in the ring.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.811
(Vice laughing mockingly)

20:43.920 --> 20:45.160
Catch you on the flipside, bro.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.326
(TJ) It looks like Brady Malibu

20:46.400 --> 20:48.323
- is headed for the beach.
- Dad, are you all right?

20:48.400 --> 20:50.084
(Vice) Come here, referee,
where's my belt?

20:50.680 --> 20:52.284
- You! Come here.
- Oh, come on.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.170
(TJ) Looks like we have
some time to catch up.

20:55.240 --> 20:58.244
So, what have you been up to
for the last quarter century, Mike?

20:58.440 --> 21:01.091
Oh,
well I became a chimney sweep.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.323
That actually exists
outside of Mary Poppins?

21:04.480 --> 21:06.926
- Okay. I'm all right.
- You okay?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.162
Yeah, I think so.
Okay.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.321
Honey, what happened?

21:11.280 --> 21:14.762
A lot! Give me the costume.
I am going to be your superhero.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.969
Okay, as much as I would
love to see you in spandex,

21:18.040 --> 21:20.486
are you sure you should get
into the ring with Vick Vice?

21:20.560 --> 21:21.846
I don't have a choice.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.526
Max, you go tell Mike and TJ, no matter
what happens, just to play along.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.846
Okay, got it.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.001
(TJ) Tell us, Mike,

21:27.080 --> 21:30.766
what is the key
to sweeping a good chimney?

21:30.840 --> 21:33.525
The key is having
the right tools. Yeah.

21:33.600 --> 21:37.002
The modern chimney sweeps
use more than just a brush.

21:37.720 --> 21:42.487
Yes. You have your
your double worm screw,

21:42.560 --> 21:44.085
your hinged drop scraper,

21:44.160 --> 21:48.290
and the always, always helpful
boring tool. Whoops!

21:48.360 --> 21:51.409
- You're a boring tool.
- Hey!

21:51.480 --> 21:53.084
(laughter)

21:54.080 --> 21:56.287
- We have one other question...
- Oh...

21:56.360 --> 21:58.010
My dad said to play along

21:58.080 --> 21:59.809
- no matter what, okay?
- All right.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.127
Tell him to make it quick.
We're running short of material

22:02.200 --> 22:04.441
and this audience is receding
quicker than Mike's hairline.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.363
- Yeah. Hey! Wait a minute.
- Okay.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.410
Who will face me?
Who is man enough?

22:09.480 --> 22:12.609
Will somebody fight the pansy?
Don't make me come down there.

22:12.680 --> 22:13.920
I know, I know, I'll calm down.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.400
You're right.
I need some potassium.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.283
I will!

22:17.360 --> 22:18.521
(cheering)

22:18.600 --> 22:21.888
- I've got nothing to lose!
- (Cheering and applause)

22:36.000 --> 22:37.764
Hello there, Russ.

22:37.840 --> 22:41.970
Is that a juicy,
possibly turkey sausage?

22:42.040 --> 22:43.530
Nope, it is a worm.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.762
A disgusting,
not at all Bavarian worm.

22:45.840 --> 22:50.368
A worm? 'Cause it smells
like a turkey sausage

22:50.440 --> 22:53.808
with a little bit of
Bavarian mustard on it.

22:54.120 --> 22:57.010
Who's gonna save you
this time, matey?

23:00.800 --> 23:02.131
Blimey!

23:02.200 --> 23:04.089
Come back here,
you little ratter.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.445
Mama, look! A doggy!

23:09.440 --> 23:11.727
Okay, I can do this.
Just stay calm.

23:11.800 --> 23:12.881
Okay, what the...

23:14.320 --> 23:15.560
- Huh?
- (Crowd laughter)

23:19.400 --> 23:21.164
Hey, go get the dog.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.924
Dude, what do I look like,
a dog walker?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.490
You're not much of a wrestler.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.002
It's Brady Malibu and... a dog?

23:33.080 --> 23:35.208
- (Mike) A dog!
- Come on, Malibu!

23:35.800 --> 23:36.847
(Vice laughing)

23:38.640 --> 23:39.971
What's the kid doing?

23:40.040 --> 23:43.089
Hey, wait. Max said to
go with it no matter what.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.241
- Okay.
- Yeah.

23:44.360 --> 23:48.490
Well it appears that the only man
man enough is not a man at all,

23:48.640 --> 23:49.880
but a dog.

23:49.960 --> 23:52.008
- (man) Call the dog catcher.
- (Man 2) Come on!

23:55.320 --> 23:57.482
Oh, this is not going
to be good.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.649
All right, doggy!

24:07.720 --> 24:10.087
I'm going to teach you
a new trick!

24:10.160 --> 24:13.528
The kid doesn't stand a chance.
I can't watch.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.567
What is going on?
What is this?

24:25.040 --> 24:26.161
He's got him in a chokehold.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.491
- He's done.
- Don't film it.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.081
He's got him!

24:35.960 --> 24:37.166
Woo-hoo!

24:40.560 --> 24:42.881
(Mike) And down goes Vick Vice.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.002
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.320
The kid has moves!

24:47.240 --> 24:50.005
<i>'</i> Yes!

24:50.320 --> 24:52.846
- Three! He is out!
- Yes!

24:54.200 --> 24:57.090
- This is incredible!
- The winner!

24:57.160 --> 25:01.165
- Yes, he won!
- The dog has beaten Vick Vice!

25:03.600 --> 25:04.761
What?

25:05.600 --> 25:08.285
Why is everything spinning?

25:12.120 --> 25:13.724
(Max)
You think he's going to be okay?

25:15.280 --> 25:19.046
Well, he is a little
malnourished, dehydrated and

25:19.160 --> 25:20.446
in desperate need of a bath,

25:20.520 --> 25:23.285
but other than that,
I think he's fine.

25:23.360 --> 25:26.250
- Can we keep him?
- Yeah, can we keep him?

25:26.320 --> 25:27.970
He can be friends
with the monkey.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.042
Lena, your monkey's only a toy.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.282
(Colleen) He probably has
a family somewhere.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.000
(Colleen) We don't know who
he belongs to.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.361
Hi, little guy. I'm Max.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.726
And this is my sister, Lena.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.928
Don't be afraid, little puppy.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.570
We won't hurt you.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.806
He doesn't have a collar.
He could be homeless.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.086
Just perfect.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.889
Now we truly are
the laughing stock

25:47.960 --> 25:49.041
of the wrestling world.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.610
Can he please stay?

25:55.640 --> 25:57.608
All right.
He can stay for the night.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.011
<i>'</i> Yes!
<i>'</i> Yes!

26:02.200 --> 26:03.690
Last night
was so embarrassing...

26:03.760 --> 26:06.604
There he is.
The newest YouTube sensation.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.281
Uh, what do you mean,
YouTube sensation?

26:09.360 --> 26:11.966
Are you not aware that
a video of last night's match

26:12.040 --> 26:14.202
had over a million views
on YouTube?

26:14.280 --> 26:16.521
The dog's trending on Twitter.
He's all over instagram.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.523
- Your wrestling dog is a star.
- (Reporter) Any comments?

26:18.600 --> 26:20.967
- Wow!
- And when is his next match?

26:21.040 --> 26:24.044
- His next match...
- Next Thursday.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.168
Next Thursday.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.641
But you said

26:28.720 --> 26:32.167
we were going to give
the dog back to the pound.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.641
- Oh, no. Not the pound.
- She's a little confused.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.000
You heard the boy.
Next Thursday!

26:36.040 --> 26:37.087
Yep!

26:37.160 --> 26:40.004
Ferraro Wrestling, and we hope
to see everyone down here

26:40.080 --> 26:41.969
for the wrestling event
of the millennium.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.320
Will Russell get star billing?

26:43.400 --> 26:44.811
(reporter) How did you teach
your dog to wrestle?

26:44.880 --> 26:45.927
See what I mean?

26:46.040 --> 26:48.000
The little guy can't wait
to get back to training.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.971
That's the gym.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.403
And so we meet again.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.405
- Hunk?
- Yup!

27:06.520 --> 27:09.524
Russell, allow me to
introduce you to ll Maniac.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.126
Or as I call him,
the Italian Stallion.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.250
I like your style, kid.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.124
You had some great
moves last night.

27:16.440 --> 27:19.683
- Uh, great moves?
- Yeah, in the wrestling match.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.489
When you chocked out Vick Vice.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.882
Oh, I have a question, Mr. Hunk.
What's wrestling?

27:24.960 --> 27:26.485
Wrestling is when two large men

27:26.560 --> 27:28.130
battle their hearts out
in the ring.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.611
In front of their fans.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.524
Asking for nothing
more than pride, glory,

27:32.600 --> 27:34.409
and of course,
a large sum of money.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.801
- You know, wrestling.
- Oh?

27:39.720 --> 27:41.006
Follow me, kid.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.888
All this could be yours.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.929
How would you like
to be a wrestler?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.765
But I'm not a large man.
I'm a small dog.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.923
Russell, my boy, the sooner
you learn this the better.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.526
It's not the size of the dog
in the fight,

27:59.600 --> 28:01.762
it's the size of the fight
in the dog.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.525
You're saying I can wrestle?

28:04.600 --> 28:05.806
You've got the gift, Russ.

28:05.880 --> 28:09.043
And with the right trainer,
namely me,

28:09.120 --> 28:11.726
I think you could be one of the
greatest wrestlers of all time.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.963
Doesn't that sound amazing,
being one of the greats?

28:15.040 --> 28:16.849
That sounds like
a lot of pressure.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.288
Yeah, well, do you want to live
your life under the ring?

28:20.360 --> 28:22.249
Hiding, always wondering,

28:22.320 --> 28:26.041
but never actually experiencing
what the world has to offer?

28:26.120 --> 28:27.326
- Well...
- No.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.765
The answer is no!

28:28.840 --> 28:32.162
You want to be king of the ring.
Master of the mat.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.924
Pharaoh of the...

28:34.920 --> 28:37.810
Let me get back to you on that.
Look, kid, I know we just met,

28:37.880 --> 28:39.530
but I've got a nose for talent.

28:39.600 --> 28:42.763
It's just what I really want
is a family.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.524
I think I can arrange that.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.886
How about the Ferraros?

28:45.960 --> 28:47.962
Really?
You think those people...

28:48.080 --> 28:49.730
they would be my family?

28:49.800 --> 28:51.689
Sure, kid. They're counting
on you to wrestle.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.047
I have a family?
I have a family!

28:54.120 --> 28:57.567
In that case, I'll wrestle!
Hot diggity dog!

28:57.640 --> 28:59.608
All right, Russ. Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.330
I still have to
negotiate the deal.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.846
You have to negotiate
to get a family?

29:03.920 --> 29:05.081
Technically, no.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.004
But in reality,
everything's a negotiation.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.208
Now, let's go speak
to the people.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.282
You speak People?
But you're a...

29:12.360 --> 29:13.600
A monkey, yes.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.251
A monkey who can
speak People, Zebra, Feline,

29:16.320 --> 29:17.606
Canine obviously,

29:17.680 --> 29:20.570
Pachyderm and little bit of
Squirrel like "Pass the nuts."

29:20.640 --> 29:22.847
I speak like six
different species.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.968
It's a talent. I'm gifted.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.008
- Enough said.
- But how?

29:27.080 --> 29:29.003
Animals can't speak to humans.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.487
Inquisitive fellow, aren't you?
Well, it goes like this:

29:31.560 --> 29:35.281
I was imprisoned,
part of this experiment

29:35.360 --> 29:37.727
<i>to see if humans could
teach monkeys to talk.</i>

29:37.800 --> 29:39.768
<i>You know, monkey see, monkey do,
yada, yada,</i> yada.

29:39.880 --> 29:40.961
Flower.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.042
<i>(Hunk)
Then I made a big mistake.</i>

29:44.080 --> 29:45.366
Banana.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.281
Oops.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.362
(Hunk) <i>What can I say?
I lost it.</i>

29:49.440 --> 29:50.771
<i>I'm only a monkey.</i>

29:50.840 --> 29:54.481
<i>The jig was up.
I knew I had to escape.</i>

30:01.760 --> 30:03.171
Then I walked in the ring.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.930
Met Maximiliano.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.766
He introduced me to the
greatest sport of all time.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.410
And the rest is
wrestling history.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.403
Two million one hundred
eighty-seven

30:12.480 --> 30:13.970
and sixty-two views!

30:14.080 --> 30:17.084
It's just as amazing on video.
Look at his leap.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.525
We can't find him anywhere.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.649
<i>(Hunk, over PA)
Yo! Attention, Ferraros!</i>

30:22.720 --> 30:24.563
<i>Family meeting, ring side!</i>

30:24.640 --> 30:26.608
- Who said that?
- (Hunk) Pronto!

30:26.720 --> 30:29.326
Okay, I know that voice.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.329
(barking)

30:34.560 --> 30:37.769
Look, he's not scared anymore,
are you, boy?

30:39.040 --> 30:41.247
The kid's got a name.
It's Russell.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.966
Okay, seriously, who said that?

30:44.040 --> 30:47.761
- Over here, Nathaniel.
- (Shrieks) Monkey!

30:47.840 --> 30:49.683
Hey, now, you don't see me
jumping around

30:49.760 --> 30:51.683
and shouting "Ah, human!"

30:56.600 --> 30:57.806
Hunk?

30:58.520 --> 31:02.002
- It's you?
- In the flesh... and fur.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.923
Wait, Nate,
you know this monkey?

31:04.000 --> 31:07.049
Of course he knows me.
We were once pals.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.600
Amigos, inseparable.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.291
See,
I told you he was real, Max.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.601
No one ever believes
the little sister.

31:14.680 --> 31:17.684
But... But you can talk like...

31:17.760 --> 31:19.683
You're using words and things.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.444
And I thought
I just made that part up.

31:21.520 --> 31:23.204
You know,
like an imaginary friend.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.089
Well, I'm not imaginary.

31:25.160 --> 31:28.130
I'm a real monkey
with real emotions, Nate.

31:28.240 --> 31:31.687
And all this time,
not a phone call, a Tweet,

31:31.760 --> 31:34.240
an email, Instagram, nothing?

31:34.320 --> 31:37.290
- You... have email?
- No.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.408
Nor do I have an iPhone,
Facebook, or Twitter.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.847
But that's not the point.
The point is...

31:41.960 --> 31:44.964
ll Maniac and I,
we thought you forgot about us.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.451
And then when you got here,
to make matters worse,

31:48.520 --> 31:50.807
you acted like
you didn't even care.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.723
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, Hunk.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.246
You need to apologize
to both of us.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.127
Um...

31:59.640 --> 32:03.087
You want me to
apologize to a toy figurine?

32:03.160 --> 32:04.161
Yup!

32:04.800 --> 32:06.211
Right.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.685
Sure...

32:09.080 --> 32:14.007
ll Maniac, Hunk, I am so sorry.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.481
Really, please forgive me.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.961
Okay.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.009
Great!
Let's hug it out. Come on.

32:21.080 --> 32:23.845
No, no. It's too soon
for the mushy stuff.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.531
Unless we're talking
mushy bananas, but I digress.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.250
I think introductions
are in order.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.608
Oh, of course. Of course.
This is my wife Colleen.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.289
- <i>Hello.</i>
- <i>Ciao bella!</i>

32:37.000 --> 32:39.571
- I'm Max.
- Good to meet you, kid.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.289
And this is
my beautiful daughter Lena.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.723
Yes, we've met.
She is quite the negotiator.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.325
We had a tea party.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.280
Enough of the pleasantries.
Let's get down to brass tacks.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.442
Obviously,
as your new star wrestler,

32:53.520 --> 32:55.284
Russell will have
some strict conditions.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.203
- (barks)
- Number one:

32:57.280 --> 32:59.567
Russell is officially part
of the Ferraro family.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.768
Number two:
He will get no less than

33:01.840 --> 33:03.444
two ripe banana bunches.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.851
Yellow, no spots.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.769
Seven blended banana smoothies,

33:06.880 --> 33:10.089
and 12 banana popsicles weekly.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.924
What can I say, the kid's
wild about bananas.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.889
- Right.
- And of course,

33:14.960 --> 33:17.850
if Russell decides to wrestle,
I'll be his trainer.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.727
Did you say you're the trainer?

33:21.800 --> 33:22.847
Mamma mia!

33:22.920 --> 33:25.810
Do you think ll Maniac
became a legend on his own?

33:26.480 --> 33:27.720
- Uh...
- Huh?

33:27.800 --> 33:29.882
- Well, do you?
- No.

33:29.960 --> 33:33.282
- You trained the ll Maniac?
- Yup!

33:34.440 --> 33:37.171
Yes, the Sefiora Karen
has a question.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.605
It's Colleen.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.444
What about his family?

33:40.520 --> 33:41.681
He doesn't have one.

33:41.760 --> 33:42.921
But how do you know?

33:43.040 --> 33:44.883
I speak Canine as well,
obviously.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.048
- Obviously.
- Of course.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.406
Do we have a deal, Nate?

33:49.280 --> 33:50.884
Sure, why not?

33:54.440 --> 33:57.171
Barn!
We're back in business, baby.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.405
Mr. Hunk,

34:00.480 --> 34:02.960
do you think, maybe,
you could train me too?

34:03.040 --> 34:05.611
Sure, kid. Russell's going
to need a training partner.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.806
(barks)

34:06.880 --> 34:09.326
(Russell Maniac theme plays)

34:21.520 --> 34:23.601
(belching)

34:26.600 --> 34:29.045
Got you! You got banana bombed.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.442
All right, intimidate me.

34:32.840 --> 34:33.966
(growls)

34:34.040 --> 34:35.643
Watch and learn, kids.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.808
- (growls) <i>'</i> (gasping)

34:40.400 --> 34:42.971
Hey, where did everybody go?

34:45.320 --> 34:46.889
(groaning)

34:51.280 --> 34:52.520
(straining) One.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.370
Hold it steady, Russ.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.889
Channeling your inner chi

34:59.960 --> 35:01.962
will give you the strength
to defeat men

35:02.040 --> 35:04.168
ten times your size.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.090
The Stinging Dog.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.084
Floats like a butterfly,
stings like a bee.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.964
Dogosaurus Rex.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.044
Okay, come on, Russ.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.441
All right.
What you lack in size,

35:23.520 --> 35:26.410
you make up for with
quickness and agility.

35:26.520 --> 35:27.681
Watch and learn.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.525
Boom, baby!

35:42.880 --> 35:44.291
Woo!

35:44.360 --> 35:45.691
Russell!

35:52.720 --> 35:53.960
Come on, Russell.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.607
Go on. I'll watch
your form from the back.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.651
I'm going backwards. Help!

36:05.000 --> 36:07.970
Help! Where are the
breaks on this thing?

36:08.040 --> 36:09.326
Oh, no! Oh, come on!

36:09.680 --> 36:11.330
Yeah, that's gonna
leave a mark.

36:11.400 --> 36:12.447
You okay?

36:22.120 --> 36:23.121
I got it.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.287
(barks)

36:30.080 --> 36:34.130
- Team Russell Mania!
- Team Russell Mania!

36:34.920 --> 36:38.049
(TJ) <i>This is an enthusiastic
crowd here tonight, Mike,</i>

36:38.120 --> 36:40.009
thanks to the mania created by

36:40.080 --> 36:42.651
YouTube sensation
Russell Maniac.

36:42.760 --> 36:44.444
Oh, that's right, TJ.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.887
Who will win the battle royale?

36:46.960 --> 36:48.883
The last man, or mummy standing,

36:48.960 --> 36:52.043
will face the incredible
Russell Maniac!

36:57.080 --> 37:00.527
And Neanderthal
has gone extinct.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.082
That's check
and it's over, matey!

37:15.160 --> 37:16.400
The winner!

37:17.640 --> 37:19.165
I know you're nervous, kid.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.083
Heck, I'm petrified for you.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.162
On the plus side,
if you do get hurt,

37:23.240 --> 37:24.890
the bandages
are really close by.

37:24.960 --> 37:27.804
What happened to "it's not
the size of the dog in the fight

37:27.880 --> 37:29.928
it is the size of the
fight in the dog", stuff?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.048
You're right, Russy baby.
I lost it there.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.724
You're going to do great, kid.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.201
Believe in yourself, Russell.
You can do it.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.248
Are we ready for the main event?

37:38.360 --> 37:39.964
(cheering)

37:40.040 --> 37:43.567
It's time to Russell!

37:48.440 --> 37:49.487
- Russell!
- Russell!

37:50.160 --> 37:53.209
I say this mummy is wound tight
and ready to go.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.130
Go, Russell!

38:05.000 --> 38:06.081
I want a clean fight.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.049
Protect yourself at all times.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.171
Bad breath!

38:12.240 --> 38:14.129
All right, shake hands or paws.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.365
- What?
- Come on, Russell!

38:17.480 --> 38:19.721
I want to wish you luck
in our upcoming battle.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.450
May the best wrestler win.

38:21.520 --> 38:24.091
Russell, no!
Don't shake paws with him!

38:24.160 --> 38:25.650
(Max)
Don't, Russell! Russell!

38:27.400 --> 38:31.166
(TJ) Oh, no! The mummy
has Russell in the spin cycle!

38:34.240 --> 38:35.401
- Uh oh.
- Oh no!

38:36.360 --> 38:37.646
(man) What are you doing?

38:38.480 --> 38:41.006
(crowd booing)

38:41.400 --> 38:43.880
Your chi, Russell!

38:43.960 --> 38:46.531
Channel your chi!

38:51.520 --> 38:52.965
(TJ) Wait a minute.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.847
The Russell Maniac
is getting up.

39:01.240 --> 39:03.846
The Russell Maniac is unleashed.

39:07.680 --> 39:08.966
- Oh, yeah! - good, Russell!

39:09.600 --> 39:12.922
Things are starting
to unravel for the mummy.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.010
(crowd laughing)

39:19.400 --> 39:20.401
Yes!

39:20.480 --> 39:22.608
(crowd cheering)

39:23.240 --> 39:24.287
Yeah!

39:25.200 --> 39:27.487
The mummy goes down
for the count.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.965
- One!
- Yeah!

39:30.040 --> 39:31.166
TWO!

39:32.320 --> 39:34.641
Three! He's out!

39:34.720 --> 39:37.564
(TJ)
Looks like this match is a wrap!

39:37.640 --> 39:38.721
Yeah!

39:39.360 --> 39:42.204
- The winner!
- This is madness.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.884
This is Russell madness.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.044
Good job, Russell!

39:47.120 --> 39:49.964
<i>(chanting)
Russell! Russell! Russell!</i>

39:50.040 --> 39:52.407
This is amazing.
Everyone loves me.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.528
You're the king of the ring,
Russy baby.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.406
Yeah. What a match.

39:57.480 --> 39:59.289
You showed that mummy
who's daddy.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.089
You got it.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.605
Russell's got the moves.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.011
Oh, that was genius, Nate.

40:04.080 --> 40:06.651
That was just genius.
Mick Vaughn.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.530
- Wrestlers United Federation.
- Oh, yeah.

40:09.600 --> 40:12.410
Yeah, Mr. Vaughn, I know who...
I've heard of you.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.847
I just didn't expect
to see you here, that's all.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.684
Or the dead skunk that's
on your head.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.565
Guy with a sense of humor, huh?

40:20.280 --> 40:22.442
That's your grandfather's
monkey, isn't it?

40:22.520 --> 40:23.601
That's... That's right.

40:23.680 --> 40:26.160
I came here to talk to the
organ grinder, not the monkey.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.049
And I'll grind you
into the ground.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.724
Place still looks the same

40:29.800 --> 40:31.450
and frankly smells the same

40:31.520 --> 40:34.330
as when your grandfather
Maximiliano ran it.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.970
We think of it as nostalgic.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.930
Oh, yeah, that's
a good word for it, nostalgic.

40:39.080 --> 40:40.161
That's cute.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.242
So, uh, what brings you by,
Mr. Vaughn?

40:42.320 --> 40:44.721
Oh, I'm just a paying customer
just like the rest of them.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.084
Right there. I heard what
was happening,

40:47.160 --> 40:49.083
thought I'd come down
and have a look-see and...

40:49.160 --> 40:50.286
that's brilliant.

40:50.360 --> 40:53.489
Where did you ever come up with
the idea for a wrestling dog?

40:53.560 --> 40:55.244
He's a slimeball, Nate.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.049
Look at that orange spray tan.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.360
Listen to his jokes.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.249
Just stop monkeying around.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.926
No, I'm not monkeying around.
I'm serious.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.206
Well, you see, back in the day

41:04.280 --> 41:05.566
when your grandfather
was around,

41:05.640 --> 41:07.961
it was all about wrestling,
but today,

41:08.040 --> 41:09.929
no, frankly it's
about entertainment.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.607
Now, I happen to run
the largest live event outfit

41:13.680 --> 41:15.045
on the entire of West Coast.

41:15.160 --> 41:18.164
We've got pay-per-view,
we've got merchandising,

41:18.240 --> 41:20.527
we've got the YouTube
on the Interweb.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.567
You and I could work
well together, son.

41:23.640 --> 41:27.122
We could make Russell
the biggest show on Earth.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.404
Take the Ferraro family name

41:29.480 --> 41:32.165
right back to the top
of the wrestling world.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.120
Right.

41:35.360 --> 41:39.160
That's a fantastic opportunity,
but we're on fire, right now.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.288
So, I think we'll have to
respectfully pass.

41:41.360 --> 41:42.771
But thank you, Mr. Vaughn.

41:45.280 --> 41:48.568
Yeah, well, you know,
don't burn the place down.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.846
No. I won't.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.605
I'm sure, you won't.
You're a smart kid.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.809
- Thank you.
- Yeah, a real smart kid.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.408
- Good work tonight, Russell.
- (Barks)

42:07.520 --> 42:08.965
I'm proud of you.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.451
What am I?
Chopped bananas?

42:11.360 --> 42:13.840
Which, by the way, with a little
warm milk are very tasty.

42:13.920 --> 42:16.571
You too, Hunk.
We wouldn't be here without you.

42:16.640 --> 42:19.120
- All right, night night, buddy.
- Night, Dad.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.486
Sweet dreams.

42:27.120 --> 42:29.202
Thank you for making
my wish come true.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.645
Who're you talking to, kiddo?

42:30.720 --> 42:33.724
- My wishing star.
- Wishing star?

42:33.800 --> 42:36.849
I don't believe in all that
mumbo-jumbo make believe stuff.

42:36.920 --> 42:39.571
It's all about hard
work and perseverance, kid.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.883
And I might add
a supremely talented coach.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.806
I guess, but everything
I wished for came true.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.962
I have friends, family,

42:49.040 --> 42:50.963
and someone that
believes in me.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.565
Thank you for training me, Hunk!

42:52.640 --> 42:55.371
Hey, let's not dwell
on one match, kid.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.442
- It's too soon to celebrate.
- You're right.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.964
Well, good night, Hunk.
You too, ll Maniac.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.405
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.960
Bugs? Where? I hate bugs!

43:09.640 --> 43:12.723
Well, it looks like
we finally broke even.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.166
One more match and
we are into the money!

43:16.280 --> 43:17.441
Woo!

43:17.520 --> 43:19.602
I knew you had it in you,
Nathaniel.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.648
I guess wrestling is
in the Ferraro blood.

43:21.720 --> 43:25.520
You know, now that you've had
a taste of sweet, sweet success,

43:25.600 --> 43:28.410
it seems like you might
not be in such a hurry to

43:28.480 --> 43:30.562
sell the building and move
back to San Diego.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.887
- Am I right?
- Maybe.

43:34.160 --> 43:35.161
Hello!

43:36.200 --> 43:37.531
Is anybody here?

43:38.480 --> 43:40.050
- Who's that?
- I'm not sure.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.651
Oh, I'm sorry. We're closed.

43:43.720 --> 43:45.245
Tickets will be on sale
in few days.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.607
- I'm Bernadette Olsen.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

43:50.520 --> 43:53.410
You can call me Bernie.
The building inspector.

43:55.240 --> 43:56.685
Hi, Bernie.

43:56.760 --> 44:00.128
Ms. Bernie, I didn't
order an inspection so...

44:00.240 --> 44:03.847
Yes, and I think
that may be the problem.

44:06.800 --> 44:07.926
I'm sorry to say

44:08.040 --> 44:10.441
that in addition to
structural maintenance required,

44:10.520 --> 44:12.409
the electrical system is...

44:14.520 --> 44:16.727
- ...shocking!
- Oh, Bernie!

44:16.840 --> 44:19.002
- Bernie! Bernie!
- Bernie!

44:19.080 --> 44:20.366
You okay?

44:22.080 --> 44:24.481
Let's have a look
at your sprinkler system.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.801
This sprinkler system's
on the fritz.

44:29.880 --> 44:32.042
Can you hand me a
monkey wrench, please?

44:37.720 --> 44:39.165
(rumbling) (bumbling)

44:41.560 --> 44:42.641
Oh!

44:45.280 --> 44:47.248
(Hunk groans in disgust)

44:47.320 --> 44:50.403
This thing expired in 1986.

44:51.200 --> 44:54.807
- See, it doesn't even work.
- I wouldn't monkey with that.

44:54.920 --> 44:56.206
Is that really necessary?

44:56.280 --> 44:58.601
Please, Mr. Ferraro,
I'm a professional.

45:01.080 --> 45:02.525
Oh!
Oh, boy.

45:04.560 --> 45:07.131
Basically the building
isn't up to fire code.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.771
I estimate, and this is
ballpark, of course,

45:09.840 --> 45:13.367
$64,894 and ten cents.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.811
I don't have that kind of money.

45:14.880 --> 45:17.804
I'd have to put on two, three,
four, 50 matches to raise that.

45:17.880 --> 45:19.609
I can't allow any matches
in this building

45:19.680 --> 45:22.001
until it's brought up to code.
It's out of my hands.

45:22.080 --> 45:23.560
Surely there's something
you could do.

45:24.520 --> 45:26.329
What did the ratted,
twisty piece

45:26.400 --> 45:28.243
of string say, Mr. Ferraro?

45:28.320 --> 45:31.051
- I'm not sure.
- I'm a frayed knot.

45:33.040 --> 45:34.565
Good day, Mr. Ferraro.

45:37.240 --> 45:38.651
What are we going to do?

45:43.600 --> 45:46.922
If I had dollar for every time I
heard that, I'd be even richer.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.047
(chuckling)

45:48.120 --> 45:51.203
Nate, tell me we're not making
a deal with this cheese ball.

45:51.280 --> 45:54.090
We don't have a choice, Hunk.

45:55.480 --> 45:58.006
We have no more money.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.923
And we can't hold any events
at our arena

46:00.000 --> 46:01.889
until we pass the inspection.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.566
But he's like a banana
with too many brown spots.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.244
Not to be trusted.

46:06.320 --> 46:08.687
Don't worry about it, okay?
I got this.

46:08.760 --> 46:10.364
It takes two to tango.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.568
I've seen you dance
and that tango comment

46:12.640 --> 46:14.563
is not instilling confidence.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.768
You just zip it.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.525
Nate, what are you
doing sitting there?

46:22.080 --> 46:23.730
Come on, join the fun.

46:23.840 --> 46:26.605
You know my attorney, Milo.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.245
Nice to meet you.

46:28.680 --> 46:29.806
Charmed, I'm sure.

46:29.880 --> 46:33.202
Listen, Nate, we love Russell
around here at the WUF.

46:33.280 --> 46:36.124
We think he's going to be big.
I mean, bigger than big.

46:36.480 --> 46:39.609
I want him to have his own line
of action toys, lunch boxes.

46:39.680 --> 46:42.729
You name it, you're going to see
his face right on it.

46:43.600 --> 46:46.649
Let the WUF take
the monkey off your back!

46:47.360 --> 46:49.283
Yoo-hoo, I heard that.
I'm right here.

46:49.360 --> 46:50.691
Easy, cowboy.

46:51.840 --> 46:55.128
So, what's your offer,
Mr. Vaughn?

46:55.560 --> 46:59.565
Well, in exchange for
the use of our WUF brand and

46:59.640 --> 47:01.768
to have access
to all of our talent...

47:02.520 --> 47:03.646
51 percent.

47:04.680 --> 47:06.887
Fifty-one percent?

47:07.360 --> 47:10.728
Yeah, that's what I said.
It's... It's my final offer.

47:12.160 --> 47:13.924
Come on, Nate, use your head.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.082
Don't be such a cheeky monkey.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.647
Hey, cheeky?

47:19.720 --> 47:22.291
What? Do you want a
small piece of a big pie,

47:22.400 --> 47:24.243
or would you rather
have no pie at all?

47:24.360 --> 47:26.567
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
I like pie.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.449
On two conditions:

47:28.520 --> 47:33.128
All the home events take
place at the Ferraro arena.

47:33.200 --> 47:35.282
Which means that you supply

47:35.360 --> 47:38.330
the money to bring the
building back up to code.

47:38.400 --> 47:41.006
We wouldn't want to burn
down the house now, would we?

47:41.080 --> 47:43.208
Hey, you're telling me.

47:43.280 --> 47:46.170
That nostalgic arena
is priceless, isn't it?

47:48.360 --> 47:50.931
All right, fine.
You got yourself a deal.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.923
- Thank you.
- Don't do it, Nate.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.129
Welcome to the big show!

48:01.760 --> 48:04.127
Don't worry.
It's just temporary.

48:04.200 --> 48:07.363
As soon as we pay him back,
this building is ours.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.851
Free and clear.

48:37.760 --> 48:40.525
Well, Mr. Ferraro.

48:40.600 --> 48:43.683
I'm happy to report your
arena meets the inspection.

48:43.760 --> 48:44.921
Congratulations!

48:45.680 --> 48:49.480
Thank you so much, Mrs... Olsen.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.887
And it's Thursday night
and Ferraro Wrestling

48:53.960 --> 48:55.371
has never looked better.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.044
Russell Maniac's opponent,
the Mongol,

48:57.160 --> 48:58.844
looks intimidating, Mike.

48:59.640 --> 49:00.721
- You can do it!
- Come on, Russ!

49:00.800 --> 49:02.529
(Hunk) That's my golden boy
right there.

49:02.600 --> 49:04.284
- Woo-hoo!
- (Gasps from crowd)

49:06.800 --> 49:09.644
(Mike) He rocks the Mongol
in the middle of the ring.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.044
One!

49:13.120 --> 49:16.124
Two, three!
He is out!

49:16.200 --> 49:19.488
The Mongol has been knocked back
into the 14th century.

49:19.600 --> 49:22.251
- <i>This dog is unstoppable.</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

49:22.320 --> 49:24.448
<i>I feel bad for Russell's
next opponent.</i>

49:24.520 --> 49:26.887
He must be terrier-fied.

49:28.840 --> 49:32.049
That was great. That was
poetry in motion. Even better.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.406
I mean you ever tried reading
poetry in motion,

49:33.480 --> 49:34.561
it gets all jumbled.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.207
Either way, you've just turned
wrestling into an art form.

49:38.280 --> 49:40.521
We've got to name
your signature move, kid.

49:40.600 --> 49:43.046
We'll call it
the "Russell Tussle".

49:43.120 --> 49:44.451
Sounds good, Hunk.

49:44.520 --> 49:46.170
All right, listen up, Russy,
and listen good.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.810
Because I'm only
going to say this once.

49:51.360 --> 49:52.441
I'm...

49:53.760 --> 49:55.444
I'm proud of you, kiddo.

49:56.680 --> 49:59.365
There, I said it, now let's
not get all sentimental here.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.886
Thanks, Hunk.
How about a hug?

50:01.960 --> 50:04.281
No can do.
This is business, kid.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.488
How about a banana Popsicle?

50:08.120 --> 50:09.610
Don't worry, guys.

50:09.680 --> 50:13.048
You can follow the whole tour
on WU F's YouTube channel,

50:13.120 --> 50:14.770
and we'll be back
before you know it.

50:14.840 --> 50:16.046
In time for my birthday?

50:16.120 --> 50:18.168
Are you kidding me? We wouldn't
miss that for the world.

50:18.240 --> 50:20.049
And what about Easter?

50:20.160 --> 50:22.766
Hunk had promised me
he'd help me find Easter eggs.

50:22.840 --> 50:24.080
You betcha, kid.

50:24.160 --> 50:26.811
I'm pretty sure there's
an anniversary in there as well.

50:26.880 --> 50:28.769
I know. Bring it in.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.880
Come here, Russell.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.410
Okay, come on, Russell!

50:39.280 --> 50:41.123
Let's get this
show on the road!

50:41.200 --> 50:43.601

- Russell.

52:02.800 --> 52:05.007
(cheering)

52:06.080 --> 52:07.161
- Sweetie.
- Come here.

52:07.240 --> 52:08.969
Man, it is good to be back.

52:09.040 --> 52:11.168
What happens on the road,
stays on the road.

52:12.440 --> 52:13.646
I missed you guys.

52:17.160 --> 52:18.889
Looks like Mick
has the car ready.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.803
What?
You're going with him?

52:21.760 --> 52:24.923
- Yeah.
- But Dad, you just got back.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.729
You missed my birthday.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.370
And the Easter bunny.

52:29.760 --> 52:32.411
Honey, this has gotten
out of hand.

52:32.480 --> 52:34.960
All we ever wanted was to spend
more time together as a family,

52:35.040 --> 52:37.361
and now,
we barely see you or Russell.

52:37.440 --> 52:41.604
I... I know, but I'm doing
this for you guys. For us.

52:42.080 --> 52:45.084
Okay, I promise,
just one more match,

52:45.160 --> 52:47.811
and we'll retire after
Russell wins the title.

52:47.880 --> 52:50.121
It's always best to go
out on top, right?

52:51.280 --> 52:53.647
Come on, hang in there.
Please.

52:53.720 --> 52:55.722
(horn honking) Nate!

52:59.040 --> 53:01.042
- We've got to go.
- Mm-hmm.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.441
Come on, Russell.
Let's go, buddy.

53:05.520 --> 53:08.444
Hey, you can leave the monkey.
It's just a meet and greet.

53:11.560 --> 53:13.483
I'll see you at home soon,
okay, Hunk?

53:13.560 --> 53:15.005
I had plans anyway.

53:15.080 --> 53:18.641
Got to alphabetize
my banana collection.

53:23.640 --> 53:24.721
(whines)

53:31.560 --> 53:33.050
Love you guys!

53:38.720 --> 53:41.530
Oh, yeah, Nate, I made
a little change of plan here.

53:41.600 --> 53:44.410
I'm going to hold the title
match at the WUF arena.

53:44.480 --> 53:47.404
Yeah, yours is too small
for an event this size.

53:47.720 --> 53:49.961
Our Russell is way too big now.

53:51.840 --> 53:53.569
Hey, Nate.
Hey, you listening?

53:54.200 --> 53:56.328
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

53:56.840 --> 53:58.080
Makes sense, Mick.

53:59.160 --> 54:02.084
We made it...
It was so many...

54:02.800 --> 54:04.962
people.
There were so...

54:10.680 --> 54:13.968
I am so sorry. That took
a lot longer than I thought.

54:14.040 --> 54:16.725
Everyone wanted a
picture with Russell.

54:16.800 --> 54:20.088
That's okay.
Hunk's been keeping me company.

54:20.160 --> 54:22.049
Phew, tag! You're in!

54:22.120 --> 54:23.690
Talk about TMI.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.967
I am just saying you better
have a blue box in your pocket.

54:26.040 --> 54:27.087
Thanks, Hunk.

54:28.240 --> 54:31.642
And I see you've
made my favorite meal.

54:31.720 --> 54:33.165
Your grandmother's lasagna.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.443
It might be
a little cold now, though.

54:37.360 --> 54:39.124
Oh. Russell.

54:40.160 --> 54:41.650
I missed you too.

54:41.720 --> 54:43.882
They wanted to be the
waiter and the hostess tonight,

54:43.960 --> 54:45.325
but they couldn't stay awake.

54:48.160 --> 54:49.241
You're right.

54:50.400 --> 54:51.686
Something needs to change.

54:52.800 --> 54:53.847
Come with me.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.801
Okay.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.685
- What is this?
- And voila!

55:06.800 --> 55:07.767
(gasps)

55:08.200 --> 55:11.488
You had it restored? When?

55:11.560 --> 55:13.767
I have my ways,
but let me tell you,

55:13.840 --> 55:16.491
that is a lot heavier
than it looks.

55:17.440 --> 55:18.805
Happy anniversary!

55:20.960 --> 55:24.169
(TJ) <i>Welcome to the weigh-in for
tonight's championship fight.</i>

55:26.200 --> 55:29.090
That's 25 and a half
pounds of muscle...

55:29.160 --> 55:31.242
- Yeah!
- ...for the tenacious terrier.

55:31.800 --> 55:34.565
Next up, we are joined
by the current champion

55:34.640 --> 55:37.007
Helix "The Hammer" Munroe
who will be fighting

55:37.080 --> 55:39.731
Russell Maniac later tonight.

55:39.800 --> 55:42.326
(The Hammer's theme plays)

55:43.640 --> 55:46.086
- Oh, wow.
- (Man) Wow, got a shot.

55:46.160 --> 55:47.161
Hammer time.

55:55.240 --> 55:58.164
Wow, The Hammer is exactly

55:58.240 --> 56:00.811
ten times larger
than Russell Maniac!

56:00.880 --> 56:03.724
A classic David
and Goliath story.

56:03.800 --> 56:06.326
Yeah, if David was a dog
and Goliath was an ape.

56:06.400 --> 56:10.007
Hammer, a few words: How do
you see tonight going down?

56:10.080 --> 56:12.686
First of all,
I'd just like to say

56:12.760 --> 56:14.683
you're welcome.
To everyone.

56:14.760 --> 56:16.205
You're all now better people

56:16.280 --> 56:18.567
for having been
graced with my gravitas.

56:18.640 --> 56:21.041
Well, it's good
to have confidence!

56:21.120 --> 56:22.360
That I do.

56:23.200 --> 56:25.407
And as for how tonight
is going to go down?

56:25.480 --> 56:28.131
I am going to crush
that little flea bag

56:28.200 --> 56:31.409
as if he's a bag
of fleas that I crush.

56:31.480 --> 56:32.561
(blows raspberry)

56:32.640 --> 56:34.927
And how do you respond
to that, Russell?

56:39.760 --> 56:42.081
This has turned
into a staring contest.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.242
Neither wrestler will back down.

56:48.360 --> 56:50.328
- He blinked!
- That's not fair. He cheated.

56:50.400 --> 56:51.481
(overlapping arguing)

56:51.640 --> 56:55.247
This will be an historic evening
for the WUF wrestling.

56:58.280 --> 56:59.566
How are you feeling?

57:00.360 --> 57:02.931
Good. You got this.
You're gonna do great out there.

57:03.280 --> 57:06.011
Bad news,
you can't be in the ring.

57:06.080 --> 57:08.731
Sponsors feel that a monkey
and the kid kind of detracts

57:08.800 --> 57:11.451
from Russell's tough guy image.

57:13.320 --> 57:15.527
So... yeah.

57:16.920 --> 57:20.129
- Wait. He's the trainer.
- He is the trainer.

57:20.840 --> 57:23.286
That's a good one, Nate.
Listen, seriously.

57:23.360 --> 57:25.488
We're all done with
the monkey gimmick.

57:25.560 --> 57:27.085
What...
What do you want to do?

57:27.160 --> 57:29.208
Turn the WUF into a...

57:29.680 --> 57:30.920
banana republic?

57:32.080 --> 57:33.491
That place exists?

57:33.560 --> 57:36.564
- Sounds like Nirvana.
- It's not what you think.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.604
Listen, Russell's a super star,

57:38.680 --> 57:40.080
and that's the way
it's going to be.

57:42.280 --> 57:44.931
Wait, Nate.
Is he trying to push me out?

57:46.200 --> 57:47.725
That stupid dog!

57:47.800 --> 57:50.565
I will hammer you to the
ground with my bare hands.

57:50.640 --> 57:53.086
I will hammer...
Mr. Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn.

57:53.160 --> 57:54.650
Did you see that dog
make me look like a monkey

57:54.720 --> 57:56.006
in front of all my fans?

57:56.320 --> 57:57.924
There's no easy way to say this.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.765
Russell's going to take the belt
tonight. No questions asked.

58:00.840 --> 58:02.842
- What?
- That's a question.

58:02.920 --> 58:05.571
There's no way
I'm giving my belt to Russell.

58:05.640 --> 58:07.404
You think I'm the type of guy
that's going to take bribe?

58:07.880 --> 58:09.325
Nah, maybe not, but...

58:10.360 --> 58:12.124
I wrote a number down
here for you.

58:12.200 --> 58:13.531
Oh, boy.

58:16.200 --> 58:17.486
What round do you want me
to go down in?

58:17.560 --> 58:19.369
Uh, 20 minutes in.

58:19.880 --> 58:24.204
No! I knew that dirty rat
was up to something.

58:24.280 --> 58:28.285
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls welcome to the WU F.

58:28.400 --> 58:30.402
<i>My name is Bad Chad
coming at you live</i>

58:30.480 --> 58:33.211
<i>from the WUF arena!</i>

58:37.440 --> 58:39.363
It's time for the
main event of the evening.

58:41.560 --> 58:44.564
Making his way to the ring,
it's the challenger.

58:44.640 --> 58:45.687
Nate, I gotta talk to you.

58:45.760 --> 58:47.364
Look after the match, okay,
Hunk?

58:47.440 --> 58:49.010
- But... But Nate...
- No, look...

58:49.080 --> 58:50.650
Okay, I know you're upset,
but it's just one match.

58:50.720 --> 58:51.846
We have to focus right now.

58:51.920 --> 58:55.322
He's hairier,
he's scarier, he's a Terrier!

58:55.400 --> 59:02.363
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Russell Maniac!

59:03.240 --> 59:05.288
<i>(crowd chanting)
Russell! Russell!</i>

59:05.360 --> 59:07.522
(Russell Maniac's theme plays)

59:07.600 --> 59:09.329
(cheering and whooping)

59:12.040 --> 59:13.929
(Chad)
Just listen to that crowd.

59:16.320 --> 59:18.129
Go Russell!! Wool!

59:31.320 --> 59:33.084
- Come on, Russell!
- Yeah, come on!

59:40.520 --> 59:45.003
And now, the two-time
intercontinental champion

59:45.080 --> 59:48.323
and reigning heavy weight
champion of the WUF,

59:48.400 --> 59:50.641
it's Helix "The Hammer" Munroe!

59:50.720 --> 59:52.961
(The Hammer's theme plays)

59:57.080 --> 59:59.048
(crowd booing)

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.401
(Hammer) You're welcome,
you're welcome.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.729
Eye on the prize, Russell!
Eye on the prize.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.089
(crowd booing)

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.731
You're going to lose, Hammer.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.126
Okay, that's weird.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.920
I'm going to send you
to the pound, Russell.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.890
You're out of your league, dog.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.126
(barks)

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.690
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.727
(growls)

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.447
- This is my yard, pooch!
- (Blows raspberry)

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.807
And here we go!

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.282
This is a title match.
Keep it clean.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.886
No low blows and protect
yourself at all times.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.645
Shake hands or paws.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.245
(man) Come on!

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.524
(man 2) Get it off the ring.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.646
You got this, Russell.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.848
(Chad) Russell Maniac might
be feeling a little nervous.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.925
Are you ready for some pain,
Russ?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.081
(growls angrily)

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.801
Russell, get him!

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.649
Okay, yeah!

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.607
Wow!

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.130
(crowd cheering)

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.483
- Russell!
- Great job, Russell!

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.085
(Chad) This gives new meaning
to the phrase:

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.447
"Hair of the dog that bit me."

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.688
Hey, Russ, way to go, pal.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.246
(crowd laughing)

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.767
Who has the gravitas now, baby?

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.120
(crowd cheering)

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.007
(barking)

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.561
Russell!

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.567
- Russell, he's coming! Russell!
- Now you see me.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.411
Now you don't!

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.046
Yeah!

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.930
The Hammer hits the
turnbuckle hard.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.126
(Nate) That's my dog!

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.771
Oh, yeah! Who's the champ?
Who's the champ now?

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.887
Good job, Russell.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.727
Russell!

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.047
And The Hammer is doing
the shaky chicken dance.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.084
Did you bring a pillow, because
you're about to go nighty night.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.810
And there it is, folks!
The Russell Tussle!

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.327
- Yeah, Russell!
- And The Hammer gets nailed.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.401
That's it.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.646
(barking)

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.367
- We got him now, buddy!
- You're going down!

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.966
Hit him, Russ. Hit him.
Don't mess around.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.565
(announcer) What is
Russell doing?

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.007
That's right,
who is the top dog now?

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.811
(announcer) He's giving the Hammer
valuable time to recover.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.042
Come on, Russell!
Quit showboating!

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.724
Finish the jump off!

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.205
(high-pitched whistle)

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.645
My ears!

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.371
(Russell whimpers)

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.646
- Oh, what's that?
- What's that noise?

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.484
(woman) Hey, cheater!

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.681
Wait! What's wrong with Russell?

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.889
(Chad) The Russell Maniac
is down and he is not moving.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.286
(man) Russell!

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.362
- No!
- What a turn of events!

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.561
No!

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.603
(whistle sounds)

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.923
- One!
- Russell, kick out! Kick out!

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.081
Come on, Russell, get up.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.640
" TWO!
" No!

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.848
No!

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.002
- Three!
- Russell!

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.647
(Chad) It's all over!

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.644
Russell Maniac
has been defeated!

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.370
What? No.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.371
The Hammer has struck!

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.403
- Is he hurt?
- What happened?

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.561
Are you okay, Russell?

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.968
(crowd booing)

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.368
That's messed up. No!

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.526
Yes!

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.244
- Let's go check on him.
- Okay.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.803
What a stunning main event
here at the WUF arena tonight.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.806
The WUF Heavy Weight Champion.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.687
It's okay, Russ.
It is not your fault.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.921
He cheated.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.841
What do you mean, Hunk?

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.367
The Hammer used a high-pitched
dog whistle to confuse Russell.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.686
(Hammer) Hammer time!

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.683
All right Hammer head,
what's going on?

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.331
You were supposed to throw
the fight and let Russell win.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.926
Couldn't do it.
Couldn't let that dog win.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.761
What do you mean you couldn't let the
dog win? What about the pay-off?

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.248
Pay-off?

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.289
I don't want to be like the rest
of the guys that lost to Russell.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.204
I mean, sure,
they got paid too, but...

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.402
How's their pride? Not good.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.481
Pride?

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.801
Now, everyone's going to
want to see the re-match.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.087
- Re-match?
- It's just good business.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.450
Wait a second.
He's right.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.205
We could charge the sponsors
double what they paid tonight.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.770
- Double.
- Hey!

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.962
You got something going
on in between those ears.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.168
- Way to go Hammer.
- That's what I'm talking about.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.366
Hammer time!

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.441
All right, Milo,

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.727
start working on
the papers for that rematch.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.723
You mean, it was fake?

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.529
All of this was fake?

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.681
You pay them?

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.925
How could you do this, Dad?

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.761
No.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.764
No, no, Max. It's not what
you think. I had no idea.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.770
I tried to warn you.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.605
No more.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.051
We're done.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.683
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.208
Where I come from wrestlers
win on their own merit.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.203
For the love of the sport,
not by faking it.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.567
And since we've been
in business together,

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.361
I've done nothing but compromise
my time with my family.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.284
Well, not anymore.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.045
I'm not going to have
my dog wrestle a cheater.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.646
Oh, I get what's going on here.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.644
You actually think
this dog belongs to you.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.720
Oh, naive, Nate.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.931
- This dog is mine.
- What do you mean?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.889
Oh, we got a contract.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.409
Yeah, yeah, Russell Maniac and
the Ferraro Wrestling Arena

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.644
are the sole property of
Mick Vaughn and the WUF.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.051
You sold me?

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.363
Right there, buddy.
Section seven, paragraph six.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.563
Section seven?
I... I can't...

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.847
- I can't see a section seven.
- Right there.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.808
Why you little

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.804
- sneaky, conniving...
- All right!

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.848
I was sneaky, conniving.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.287
It's not my fault that you
need glasses. Come on.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.842
Wait, no. Russell's a part
of our family.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.851
Look, kid, Russell is exactly
where he belongs right now,

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.649
with the WU F.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.961
Welcome to the big show.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.887
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- Mick, you can't do this.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.806
- Wait, Russell!
- Max!

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.522
Yeah, he's a tough guy.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.843
Yeah, you're not part of
anybody's family.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.251
You belong to me now.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.886
Hey, you're a superstar
for the WU F,

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.883
so just get used to it.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.401
(exasperated groans)

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.284
It's going to be okay, sweetie.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.488
It's not going to be okay.
Russell's gone.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.046
Max, wait!

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.441
Hold up there, Nate.
I'll go talk to Max.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.324
I didn't mean for it
to turn out like this.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.962
I know, but Max is right.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.129
Russell is a part
of this family.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.922
I miss him too, but we've gotta
keep it together.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.322
(sniffling)

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.330
Oh, who am I kidding?

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:20.448
I miss that little guy so much.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.560
- We can't let this happen.
- I know.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.928
It's not pretty seeing
a grown monkey cry.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.970
No. We've got to do
something about Russell.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.367
<i>(reporter) This just in,
Russell Maniac fans:</i>

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:54.163
<i>Mick Vaughn has just announced</i>

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.961
<i>that Russell is now the
sole property of the WUF.</i>

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:06.970
Max? Hunk?

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.604
Max and Hunk are gone.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.046
- Hello.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.522
I... I'm Derek from Pet Utopia.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.531
Well, guess this is it for me.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.126
No friends, no family.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.010
Can't even wrestle. I'm a fake.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.809
A lonely fraud.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.884
Just a crazy dog in a cage
talking to himself.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.600
- Russell.
- Russell.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.001
- Come here, boy. Russell
- Russell.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.161
Russell.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.969
Yep, I'm already hearing things.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.690
Russell, where are you?

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.606
Russell.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.844
For the love of bananas,
it's me.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.967
Hunk?

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.002
Shh!

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.891
Keep it down. I'm busting
you out of this joint.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.008
Russell,
we're here to take you home.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.845
But I let you all down.
I'm a phony.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.888
Are you kidding me?
You didn't let anyone down.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.200
You lost one match.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.566
And it was rigged.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.687
Well, maybe
they were all rigged.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.046
With Mick, we can't be too sure.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.044
But my point is,
every great champ

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.884
loses at least one match.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.281
And you know what
made them great champs?

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.567
What they did after they lost.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.530
They picked up their pride,
dusted it off,

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.170
ate a bunch of bananas

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.402
and got back in the ring.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.881
But everyone was
really disappointed in me.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.724
I saw it in their faces.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.081
Everyone loves you, Russ.

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.369
Even me. There, I said it.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.566
I love you, kiddo.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.249
Keep it together, Hunk.
Keep it together.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.881
We're on your team, you know?
Always. We're family.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.689
We all miss you, Russy baby.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.726
(barks)

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.564
Come here, Russell.
Come here.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.849
You know, I just read you need
four hugs a day to survive.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.445
Eight to really thrive.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.124
So what do you say, big guy?

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.645
Let's hug it out.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.921
(relaxed sigh)

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.570
My stress is melting away.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.361
What the...

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.010
What are we still
standing here for?

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.684
Let's blow this banana stand.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.284
- Hey, who's there?
- Uh-oh! It's the fuzz!

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.644
- What are you doing in here?
- Do you feel lucky, punk?

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.725
Drop that stick
and reach for the sky, now.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.881
Don't hurt me.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.804
Max, get his handcuffs
and cuff him to that pipe.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.728
I can put that one
in my new book.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.929
- 101 Uses For a Banana.
- You're a monkey!

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.724
Oh, boy, another genius.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.766
Let's make like
a banana and split.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.405
Come on, let's go.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.845
Come on, Russell, let's go.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.001
<i>(Hunk) Arrivederci.</i>

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.524
Come on.
We're almost there.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.442
What? You think
you can run from me?

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.926
That mutt belongs to the WU F.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.926
Hey, Nate, yeah, see now
I can press charges here.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.570
Your son's taking my property.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.248
Actually, sir,
Russell is not your property.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.201
Who's this chump?

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.329
His name is Derek
and he is from Pet Utopia.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.685
When I found out Russell
was going to be given away

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.728
to the pound, I adopted him.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.001
So as you can see, Mr. Vaughn,
Russell is not your property.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.286
He's mine.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.169
But, Russell needs a family.

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.170
And he found one
in the Ferraros.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.246
I've never seen him happier,
or braver.

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.003
I'm handing over custody of
Russell to the Ferraro family.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.525
(barks happily)

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.683
You can't do that.
He can't do that, can he, Milo?

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.965
Actually, they can do that.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.565
This contract makes ours
null and void.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.881
Mick, you have zero ownership
of the dog.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.170
(stammers)

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.924
There's something wrong here.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.849
Well, I guess that settles that.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.526
Well, you walk away now,

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.489
you still don't own
the Ferraro arena.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.084
I will evict your family.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.924
But I'll make you a deal.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.962
I'll give you the arena,
if you sign Russell over to me.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.801
How's that?
A dog for a building.

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.970
- Forget it.
- What?

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.280
You heard me.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.522
Russell is a member
of this family.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.602
And we are the Ferraros,

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.083
and family always comes first,
not greed.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.491
So you can take the building.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.245
You're making
a big mistake there, Ferraro.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.164
You're trying to succeed
where your grandfather failed.

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.402
That's your family legacy.
Failure.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.641
I've had enough of
this cheeseball

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.091
in a cheap monkey suit.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.010
It's all right, Hunk. It's okay.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.321
It's not okay.
He insulted you.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.528
Let me at him.
I'll tear him limb from limb.

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:56.331
- Your monkey talks!
- I know. I know.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.768
Apparently, humans are
dumbfounded by a talking monkey.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.880
Tell you what, Mr. Vaughn,
we'll vacate the building

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.571
by the end of day tomorrow.
Have a nice night.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.128
But that means no more
Ferraro Wrestling.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.885
That's our family legacy.
We can't lose that.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.725
He's right though.
We are all family, Russ.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.691
Yes, we are a family.
And family is a verb.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:19.969
When I met you, Hunk,
I was a scared, lonely pup.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.122
Afraid of my own shadow.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.567
You taught me about courage,
hard work,

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.007
and that everything
is a negotiation.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.320
I can't just give up now

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.880
and never know
if I was actually a champion.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.088
I will do anything
for this family.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.525
My family.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.409
We need a re-match, Hunk.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.607
Russell will do battle
with The Hammer in a re-match.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.609
And this time...
it'll be for real.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.044
And his coach will be Hunk,
the monkey.

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.246
And if he wins...

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:01.090
we get the building
and we keep Russell.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.124
All right.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:09.410
But if you lose...
I get everything.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.450
But the match has to take
place in the Ferraro arena.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.442
Well, we've got
one more provision.

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.329
It's going to be
a tag team match. Yes.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.641
So Russell's gotta
find himself a partner.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.683
This is going to be
the biggest match

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.842
in the history of the WUF.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.888
- What do you say?
- We got a deal.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.041
Hey. Yeah.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.245
Way to go, kid.
He's a smart one.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.411
It's wrestling night here
at Ferraro arena

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.370
and I'll tell you, TJ,
I... I'm a bit nervous.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.249
Yes, and in this next match,

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.369
our jobs are literally
on the line.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.886
Are you sure you
want to do this, Daddy?

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.406
I have to show Max. Yeah!

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.562
That I believe in something
more than just money.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.721
Yes, you do.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:04.371
Papa Maximiliano, he was right.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:07.364
Fame and fortune comes and goes.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.649
But family, family is forever.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.451
The very large and
incredibly intimidating

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.761
Dieter Das Mountain.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.607
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.002
(Dieter Das Mountain's theme
plays)

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.323
(speaks in German)

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.370
(crowd booing)

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.010
(speaks in German)

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:43.411
My schnitzel!
You go get 'em.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.687
- We'll crush them!
- You think you're strong enough?

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.171
- And here comes The Hammer.
- It is Hammer time!

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.483
(woman) Hammer time!

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:59.406
(The Hammer's theme
music plays)

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.087
(audience chanting)

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.331
You're welcome.
You're all welcome.

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.244
The man who once said,
and I quote,

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.085
"String cheese
really isn't string.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.650
It is just cheese."

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.483
It's an honor for you to be
my presence.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.245
- (booing)
- (Laughter)

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.125
It's Hammer time!

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.531
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.887
please welcome the one,
the only...

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.487
Russell Maniac!

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.570
(Russell Maniac's theme plays)

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.889
(woman) Russell, you're my hero!

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.564
<i>(chanting) Russell!
Russell! Russell! Russell!</i>

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.405
<i>Russell! Russell! Russell!</i>

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.000
(snarls angrily)

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.611
Yeah, I like him.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.128
In his first match ever,

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:50.205
it's Maximiliano Ferraro Junior!

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.205
(Max's theme plays)

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.604
(crowd cheering)

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.846
He's just a kid!

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.003
Okay, kids, you got this.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.447
Make Maximiliano proud.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.167
Let's do this.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.088
All right, remember,
we can't lose.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.446
We're Ferraros.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.806
The strongest
tag team is family.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.970
- Okay, we got this.
- (Bell rings)

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:50.010
Ladies and gentlemen,
this will be a tag team match.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.447
I want to see
a good clean fight.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.601
Both teams ready?

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.206
(barks)

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.367
We're ready.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.801
It's Hammer time.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.089
(speaking in foreign language)

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:06.525
It's time to wrestle!

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.647
It sounds like they're ready.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.849
Oh, boy, Max, I mean, II Maniac,

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:14.925
is going to be in the ring first
versus Dieter Das Mountain.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.163
Now, that is a big decision
for team Russell Maniac.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.891
Are you ready?
I'm going to crush you.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.564
Focus, Max.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.560
- What?
- (Man) Come on!

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.566
Max?

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.005
Now, you see me, now you don't.

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:32.681
Woohoo!

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.402
- Come on, ref
- No. Oh, please.

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.847
- This is not happening today!
- My beautiful eyes.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:40.446
- Not my son. I'll kill you.
- Mom, stop.

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.410
- Hey!
- That's Max's mom.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:46.131
- Colleen, get out of the ring!
- Mom, I got this!

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.884
Thought this was
a wrestling match.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.441
Get out of here.

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.729
Nate, listen to me.
Max has been training for this.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.165
He can do it.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.730
Mountain, behind you.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.121
- What? <i>'</i> Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.725
- Oh, yeah.
- Perfect, Max.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.848
- Nice drop, kid! Nice!
- Come on!

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.761
That's it!

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.810
- That is not nice.
- (Barks)

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.969
it could all be over
right here, Mike.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.082
Max, reverse it. Reverse it!

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.370
" TWO!
" No!

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.363
- (tweaking)
- (Screams)

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.164
My nose hair!

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.325
(TJ) Max got out of that one
by a hair.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.004
Oh, that was close.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.806
" Oh!
" Oh!

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.169
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.487
- Attaboy, Max.
- Way to go, buddy!

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:58.000
He's giving him
an atomic wedgie.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.731
- Oh, that's his underwear!
- Yes.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:04.043
I hope he wore a big pair
of underwear to work today, TJ.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.205
Who turned out the lights?

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.282
Now I get you back, kid.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.771
Wait. It's me, the ref!

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.247
No, no, no!

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.246
That's got to hurt.

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.809
Oh, no!

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.450
- Please, help me.
- Over here, buddy.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:23.124
Max, tag Russell in.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.247
(barks)

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.528
- Tag!
- Hammer, I can hear you,

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.284
but I cannot see you.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.607
- Please.
- What is this? Get out of here.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:34.920
Rock it, buddy.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.651
I got a bone to
pick with you, Hammer.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.644
(snarls agrily)

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.881
Come on, Russell!

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.484
Russell and the Hammer
meet once again.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.649
Go!

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.887
What a psych-out
by the Russell Maniac.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.411
<i>'</i> Ooh!
<i>'</i> Oh!

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.887
That was two strikes
on The Hammer, Mike.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.003
(Russell) Russell Tussle!

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.290
(crowd cheering)

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.880
Russell treats the Hammer
like his dirty laundry.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.610
That dirty rat has
something up his sleeve.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.167
Oh, no.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.684
(high-pitched dog whistle)

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.321
What's he doing?

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.686
(Russell whimpers)

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.929
Wait a minute.
He's got that thing.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.525
It looks like a dog whistle.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.682
You thought you could defeat me?

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.807
Ref, open your eyes.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.930
Yeah, smart!
Smart thinking.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.925
Look what he's doing.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.008
This might be all over now.

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.569
(mouths five to one countdown)

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.969
(TJ) He missed it!

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.930
Oh, yeah!

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.445
<i>'</i> Get up!
<i>'</i> He's okay!

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.121
Get up!

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.601
(Mike)
And the Hammer is out cold.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.886
Yes, Russell!

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.166
Woo-hoo!
Yeah!

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.490
One! Two! Three!

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.483
- (bell rings)
- He's out!

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.322
It's all over!

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.971
Russell!

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:52.730
(Mike) They are the new
tag team champions!

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.325
- The winner!
- (Cheers)

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.687
Yes!

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:01.010
- Good job, Russell.
- Way to go, Russ!

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.285
Great job, Russell.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:17.401
You idiot.
You let a tiny dog beat you.

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:18.970
What's the matter with you?

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.010
Nobody makes me
look like a monkey.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.050
You're not the boss of me.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.770
(speaking in foreign language)

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.321
- You're out!
- You're out!

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.202
I'm so proud of all of my boys.

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:45.930
Wait. Russell can't hear you.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:51.566
That's how you
defeated the Hammer?

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:52.607
You tricked him?

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.920
We knew that Hammer
would cheat again

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.765
by using the dog whistle.
So, we had a plan.

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:57.887
(barks)

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.681
Like I said, guys named Max
are always the best guys

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.843
to have it in your corner.
Come here.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.763
- I love you, buddy.
- Love you, Dad.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.368
And you, Hunk... thanks, buddy.

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.851
That was just like old times.

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.082
That was more fun
than a barrel of monkeys.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.650
You get it, Nate?
Because I'm a monkey.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:20.761
That's good.

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.327
- Are you crying, Mike?
- Yes.

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.086
- I am too. It's wonderful.
- Oh, yes.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.731
(whooping)

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:36.282
Congratulations, guys!

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.085
