ALL RIGHT?

12:02.680 --> 12:04.140
COME BACKWARDS.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.224
COME ON.
I NEED YOU TO MOVE.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.851
- [yelling]

12:06.934 --> 12:07.810
- COME ON, AMBER.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.478
YOU CAN DO IT.
COME ON.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.690
YOU'RE OKAY.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.150
- HELP!

12:14.233 --> 12:16.193
- OKAY, GREAT.

12:16.277 --> 12:19.071
- [yells]

12:23.159 --> 12:24.076
- I'M GONNA GET YOU OUT.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.244
JUST STOP SCREAMING.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.078
AND I NEED YOU TO RELAX.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.621
- OKAY, I'M NOT SCREAMING,

12:27.705 --> 12:28.789
BUT I WON'T RELAX.

12:32.877 --> 12:32.918
- UGH!

12:35.713 --> 12:37.339
OKAY, ALFIE.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.800
[coughing]

12:39.884 --> 12:40.843
NOW COME BACK.

12:40.926 --> 12:41.927
COME BACK.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.936
- ALFIE, I'M SO SORRY.

12:58.152 --> 13:02.114
- SO, POPPY, IS JEROME
KEEPING YOU OUT OF TROUBLE?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.742
- JEROME CAN'T KEEP HIMSELF
OUT OF TROUBLE.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.784
- SHUT IT, POOPY.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.369
- HE'S THE SCHOOL PRANKSTER.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.496
- REALLY?

13:08.579 --> 13:09.872
- SHE'S SHOWING OFF.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.248
- RELAX.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.960
BEING THE SCHOOL PRANKSTER
IS NOT WHAT LED ME IN TO...

13:15.044 --> 13:18.380
WELL, IT'S NOT HOW
I ENDED UP HERE.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.508
I WAS DEVASTATED
WHEN I WAS KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.801
- WHY DID YOU--
- POPPY.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.053
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.096
I MESSED UP, DIDN'T I?

13:26.180 --> 13:28.516
LIKE I ALWAYS MESSED UP, RIGHT?

13:28.599 --> 13:32.394
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.981
- THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.067
POPS, DO YOU WANT TO GET US
SOMETHING FROM THE MACHINE?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.069
SOME--SOME CHOCOLATE
OR SOMETHING?

13:45.991 --> 13:47.493
- I SWEAR, I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS GONNA--

13:47.576 --> 13:50.204
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M THRILLED TO SEE HER.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.498
OF COURSE, THE THING
I WANTED TO DISCUSS WITH YOU

13:52.581 --> 13:53.832
WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.668
IT'S OKAY.
IT'LL KEEP.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.671
BUT COME ALONE NEXT TIME.

13:58.754 --> 13:59.630
- YEP.

13:59.713 --> 14:00.839
- CHOCOLATES.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.561
- SO...

14:13.644 --> 14:15.771
I'M CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

14:15.854 --> 14:18.774
- AND I'M DEFINITELY BUG-PHOBIC.

14:18.857 --> 14:22.528
- YEAH, I DIDN'T REALLY WANT
TO SAY,

14:22.611 --> 14:25.155
I'M REALLY BAD WITH WORMS.

14:25.239 --> 14:28.033
I'M NOT PHOBIC;
I JUST HATE THEM.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.953
- IT'S LIKE THE TUNNEL KNOWS.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.329
- THAT WOULD MEAN
THERE ARE SKULLS THERE.

14:32.413 --> 14:36.458
- AND FEET.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.461
ANYONE ELSE WANT TO GO BACK
TO HITTING A DEAD END?

14:39.545 --> 14:41.755
- NO.

14:41.839 --> 14:42.423
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE FOR IT.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.924
IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE,

14:44.008 --> 14:45.467
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET OVER
OUR FEARS.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.679
- IT CAN BE DONE, OKAY?

14:48.762 --> 14:50.681
I MEAN, THERE'S ALL SORTS
OF BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES

14:50.764 --> 14:52.975
THAT TACKLE THIS STUFF NOW.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.810
THEY MOSTLY USE EXPOSURE.

14:54.893 --> 14:57.062
- I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING OFF.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.065
- NO, EXPOSURE TO THE THING
YOU FEAR.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.984
- IT'S GENTLE EXPOSURE.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.194
JUST A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME

15:04.278 --> 15:05.821
TILL YOU'RE CURED.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.781
- CURED SOUNDS GOOD.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.200
- WELL, WE'VE GOT BUGS
IN THE SCIENCE LAB.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.328
- YEAH, AND THERE'S PLENTY
OF PLACES IN THE HOUSE

15:12.411 --> 15:14.330
I CAN BUILD UP A TOLERANCE
TO SMALL SPACES.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.581
- OKAY, NOBODY'S COMING NEAR ME
WITH FEET.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.542
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.420
- [chuckling]

15:24.673 --> 15:26.550
- THAT'S ONE SERIOUS SANDWICH.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.636
- MM-MM.
IT'S A HOAGIE.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.262
- WELL, WHAT'S THAT IN THERE.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.972
- SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.015
I INVENTED IT.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.183
- AW, EDDIE,

15:34.266 --> 15:37.102
SOMEONE ALREADY INVENTED
SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.521
- I PUT IT IN A SANDWICH.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.939
OH...

15:41.023 --> 15:42.399
MM.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.359
- OH, NO THANK YOU.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.195
- MM.

15:48.280 --> 15:52.576
- SO WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU AND PATRICIA THEN?

15:52.660 --> 15:55.371
YOU KNOW, THE DANCING,
THE PUT-DOWNS.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.705
COME ON, SPILL.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.624
HAVE YOU GOT A THING FOR HER
OR WHAT?

15:58.707 --> 16:01.168
- [chuffs]

16:01.251 --> 16:02.670
WHAT'D SHE SAY?

16:02.753 --> 16:04.254
- NOTHING.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.547
- NOTHING?

16:05.631 --> 16:09.510
- WOW, YOU REALLY NEED
TO LEARN TO PLAY IT COOLER.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.804
- OH, AND YOU GOT BOY SANDWICH
ALL OVER YOUR MOUTH.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.931
- IT'S A HOAGIE!

16:19.228 --> 16:20.437
- AMBER, PUT IT AWAY.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.772
WE HAVE TO KEEP THEM
OUT OF SIGHT.

16:21.855 --> 16:23.065
- SORRY.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.983
IT'S, LIKE, MY LUCKY CHARM,
THAT'S ALL.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.985
YOU WANT ME
TO PUT MY HAND IN THERE?

16:31.573 --> 16:33.909
- NOT AT FIRST.

16:33.992 --> 16:37.913
AT FIRST, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE ONE STEP FORWARD.

16:39.581 --> 16:40.666
- A STEP?

16:40.749 --> 16:42.376
- DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD,

16:42.459 --> 16:44.837
DOES IT?

16:44.920 --> 16:47.840
JUST ONE STEP TOWARDS THE TANKS.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.967
EVERYONE.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.472
OKAY.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.849
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE ANOTHER STEP

16:56.932 --> 16:59.768
WHEN YOU'RE COMFORTABLE.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.442
LIKE THAT.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.444
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.362
AT YOUR OWN PACE.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.795
- JEROME!

17:26.878 --> 17:28.297
HOW'D IT GO?

17:28.380 --> 17:28.922
DID YOUR DAD MENTION A THING?

17:29.006 --> 17:30.466
- POPPY WAS THERE.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.133
- WHAT?

17:31.216 --> 17:32.968
- SHE FOUND THE LETTER.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.846
DON'T SAY, "I TOLD YOU SO."

17:35.929 --> 17:36.638
- OKAY.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.475
I WARNED YOU SO.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.934
- HE DID MENTION THE THING,

17:41.018 --> 17:42.811
BUT HE COULDN'T TELL ME WHAT IT
WAS IN FRONT OF POPPY.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.896
- THAT'S WEIRD.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.063
- I KNOW.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.523
DEFINITELY NEED TO GO ALONE
NEXT TIME.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.067
- PITY.

17:49.151 --> 17:49.610
- WHY?

17:49.693 --> 17:51.862
YOU MISS ME?

17:51.945 --> 17:54.156
- NO, I MEAN, YOUR FAMILY.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.741
NOW YOU SHOULD ALL BE TOGETHER.

17:55.824 --> 17:58.452
- RIGHT.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.954
WELL, NOW I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE BIG SECRET IS.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.502
[knocking]

18:06.585 --> 18:09.797
- COME IN.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.756
- ALFIE.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.842
- DOWN HERE.

18:13.926 --> 18:14.676
- HOW'S YOUR BEHAVIORAL THERAPY
GOING?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.261
- IT'S GOOD.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.972
IT'S ALL ABOUT BREATHING
EXERCISES, YOU KNOW?

18:19.056 --> 18:20.182
- YEAH.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.684
I'M UP TO THE BUG TANK
WITH THE LID OFF.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.520
ALFIE, I'M SORRY
I MADE YOU FREAK OUT.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.896
- OW!

18:25.979 --> 18:28.524
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP ABOUT IT.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.275
- ALFIE...

18:30.359 --> 18:33.195
I NEED YOU TO BE STRONG.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.196
IT'S NOT YOU.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.115
IT'S COMPLETELY ME.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.663
ALFIE, I'M BREAKING UP WITH YOU.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.206
- I BROKE UP WITH YOU!

18:44.289 --> 18:45.541
- ARE YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?

18:45.624 --> 18:46.708
- YEAH.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.462
I THINK SO.

18:50.546 --> 18:53.507
- WHY ARE YOU STILL UP?

18:53.590 --> 18:56.426
- SORRY.
JUST GOING.

19:04.143 --> 19:04.601
- OKAY, I'M READY.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.728
- ARE YOU SURE?

19:06.812 --> 19:08.856
- JUST DO IT QUICK.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.904
[stifled shrieks]

19:15.988 --> 19:17.573
- REMEMBER THE TRAINING.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.408
THINK OF IT AS A LITTLE ALFIE.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.664
- HEY, ALFIE!

19:25.747 --> 19:26.915
YOU'RE NOT SO BAD.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.333
[whimpering]

19:28.417 --> 19:29.418
- OKAY.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.253
I THINK YOU'RE READY.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.256
FABIAN?

19:34.339 --> 19:34.423
- [exhales]

19:37.551 --> 19:39.970
YEAH, I THINK I'M READY TOO.

19:40.053 --> 19:40.929
- ALFIE?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.097
- YEAH.
I THINK SO.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.682
I SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT
UNDER MY BED,

19:43.765 --> 19:45.225
AND NO STONES FELL DOWN, SO...

19:45.309 --> 19:47.102
- OKAY, THEN.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.562
LET'S GET THIS THING DONE.

19:48.645 --> 19:51.064
- AH, STUDENTS.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.318
UM, YOU REMEMBER
WE HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE

19:54.401 --> 19:56.278
ON JEWELRY AT THE SCHOOL.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.446
- NO.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.739
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.365
- WELL, NEVERTHELESS, WE DO.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.159
AND WE ARE DOING
A SPOT CHECK TODAY

20:02.242 --> 20:03.702
TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS

20:03.785 --> 20:07.706
ARE UNIFORM AND CONSISTENT
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SCHOOL.

20:07.789 --> 20:08.415
AND, UM--

20:08.498 --> 20:10.876
- ALL JEWELRY, PLEASE.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.172
- NO.

20:15.255 --> 20:18.967
- PATRICIA, PLEASE.

20:19.051 --> 20:23.138
- IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO COMPLY,

20:23.221 --> 20:30.020
YOUR PUNISHMENT WILL BE
A NEW HOUSE CURFEW.

20:30.103 --> 20:33.815
STRAIGHT TO YOUR BEDROOMS
AFTER DINNER,

20:33.899 --> 20:35.734
AND YOU WILL BE MONITORED.

20:42.658 --> 20:46.745
VERY WELL.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.830
- WAIT.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.679
- THANK YOU.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.347
THANK YOU.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.766
THANK YOU.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.142
THANK YOU...

21:09.226 --> 21:09.685
VERY...

21:09.768 --> 21:12.521
MUCH.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.130
- THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN RISK

21:38.213 --> 21:39.715
HAVING VICTOR GUARD US
'ROUND THE CLOCK.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.675
WE CAN GET THE AMULETS BACK.

21:50.308 --> 21:52.227
- WE DON'T JUST HAVE TO GET
THEM BACK.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.562
WE HAVE TO GET THEM BACK SOON,

21:53.645 --> 21:55.814
OR...

21:55.897 --> 21:57.941
IT'S OVER.
