00:58.159 --> 00:59.827
Hello, everybody.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.630
Hello. Hello.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.433
Greetings!

01:07.501 --> 01:09.137
That doesn't get any worse.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.641
JEREMY: Hello.

01:15.143 --> 01:17.511
Hello, and welcome!

01:17.578 --> 01:19.247
Welcome to The Grand Tour,

01:19.313 --> 01:21.349
which, once again,
comes to you

01:21.415 --> 01:24.152
from the shores of Loch Ness
in Scotland.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.422
Now...

01:30.391 --> 01:33.261
The reason why
we're still here is,

01:33.327 --> 01:34.795
after last week's show,

01:34.862 --> 01:38.299
these two got talking
to a man in the local town,

01:38.366 --> 01:40.168
who has convinced them that,

01:40.234 --> 01:43.237
in that lake,
there is a monster.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.274
Well, there is a monster.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.808
Have you seen it?

01:47.875 --> 01:50.311
No, but the man
was very convincing.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.045
Did he sell you
a tea towel

01:52.180 --> 01:54.882
with a drawing
of the monster on it?

01:54.948 --> 01:58.018
He did, and now we know
what the monster looks like.

01:58.085 --> 02:01.355
Exactly. We've also got
photographs of the monster.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.824
- Look, we've got this one.
- JEREMY: That's a log.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.394
JAMES: And we've got
this one. Look at that!

02:06.460 --> 02:08.362
- Monster.
- Another log.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.732
Can I just draw your
attention to a picture
I've got? Here it is.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.667
RICHARD: Well, that's
not a monster, is it?

02:13.734 --> 02:16.670
No, that is an elephant
shrew. Well spotted.

02:16.737 --> 02:20.908
Now, this is the Nissan GT-R
among animals.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.711
Have you ever seen it
on the move?
It's phenomenal!

02:23.777 --> 02:26.580
It leaves a rooster tail
and it corners like it's
got downforce.

02:26.647 --> 02:30.117
But my point is,
this is a very rare animal,

02:30.218 --> 02:34.822
and yet the photograph of it
is in sharp focus and colour.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.026
Now, all the pictures
of your monster are
in black and white.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.429
- Well, maybe it is
black and white.
- And blurry.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.030
- Maybe it's blurry.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.966
This has been driving me mad
all week, so I decided

02:46.033 --> 02:48.902
to go for a drive on some of
Scotland's, let's be honest,

02:48.969 --> 02:50.471
brilliant driving roads.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.307
- They are...
They are fantastic.

02:55.443 --> 02:58.045
And actually,
speaking of which,

02:58.111 --> 03:01.549
something called the
North Highland Initiative,

03:01.615 --> 03:03.150
set up by Prince Charles,

03:03.251 --> 03:05.686
a few years ago it came up
with the North Coast 500.

03:05.753 --> 03:10.558
Now, this was going
to be Scotland's answer
to Route 66 in America.

03:10.624 --> 03:14.262
Miles of amazing scenery.
Incredible road.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.063
Got a picture
of a bit of it here.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.265
Look at that.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.832
Huge success.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.801
Loads of big spenders came

03:20.868 --> 03:23.103
with their Lamborghinis,
and their Ferraris
and their Porsches.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.473
Hotels were full,
restaurants were packed.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.808
Local economy booming.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.143
So how long
do you think it was

03:30.278 --> 03:31.745
before the local newspaper

03:31.812 --> 03:34.882
carried a headline containing
the following words:

03:34.948 --> 03:36.850
"police" and "crackdown"?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.052
Ten days.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.821
- Two days.
- Two days.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.291
"Oh, we can't have people
driving along that!

03:43.291 --> 03:44.492
You might run
into a pedestrian!"

03:44.558 --> 03:46.460
RICHARD AND JAMES:
It's a road!

03:46.527 --> 03:49.797
I know it is.
And then you've got the A9.

03:52.099 --> 03:57.305
Ninety-nine miles
of continuous
average speed camera.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.740
- Ninety-nine miles.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.376
Now, I'm sorry, you lot,
I presume you're all
petrolheads, yes?

04:02.443 --> 04:04.312
AUDIENCE: Yes!

04:04.345 --> 04:06.914
So let me ask you a question.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.049
Dying in your beds,

04:09.116 --> 04:10.651
many years from now...

04:12.553 --> 04:15.188
...would you be willing
to trade all the days,

04:15.323 --> 04:17.858
from this day to that,

04:17.925 --> 04:19.327
for one chance,

04:19.360 --> 04:21.895
just one chance,

04:21.962 --> 04:26.534
to come back and say
to the Scottish Safety
Camera Partnership,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.869
"You can take our licences,

04:28.936 --> 04:31.138
but you can't take
our freedom"?

04:33.674 --> 04:35.676
AUDIENCE:
Freedom! Freedom!

04:35.743 --> 04:38.812
Freedom! Freedom!
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

04:38.879 --> 04:40.814
RICHARD:
Now look what you've done!

04:43.150 --> 04:44.485
JEREMY: Thank you.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.119
Look what you've done!

04:46.186 --> 04:47.755
- I know.
- That's dangerous!

04:47.821 --> 04:49.690
- I know.
- Let's get on with the show.

04:49.757 --> 04:53.427
Yes.
In tonight's car programme...

04:54.962 --> 04:56.597
An ant in a jar.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.567
A dog on a lead.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.971
And some beans on a table.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.607
But first,

05:06.674 --> 05:07.841
when someone wants to buy

05:07.908 --> 05:09.410
a large and very fast
saloon car,

05:09.477 --> 05:11.479
they tend to buy German.

05:11.545 --> 05:14.515
They think there is
no alternative.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.384
But is there?

05:22.022 --> 05:26.259
This is the Lexus GS F.

05:26.394 --> 05:31.532
And straight away,
we can see that it isn't
an especially handsome car.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.101
And it's a Lexus,

05:34.167 --> 05:36.704
which marks its owner out
as a golf enthusiast

05:36.770 --> 05:39.106
and possibly... a bore.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.510
And things are worse

05:42.576 --> 05:46.046
when you try to live with it
for a while.

05:46.113 --> 05:49.116
The most annoying thing,
apart from the buttons
on the steering wheel,

05:49.182 --> 05:53.487
all of which seem to retune
the radio to a station
you don't like very much,

05:53.554 --> 05:56.557
apart from that,
every time you reach for

05:56.624 --> 05:59.026
a can of zesty drink
in the cup holder...

06:00.561 --> 06:02.295
I've done it again!

06:02.430 --> 06:04.765
You can't help but nudge
the mouse

06:04.832 --> 06:07.935
which sets the destination
on the satnav

06:08.001 --> 06:10.003
to where you are.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.440
SATNAV:
In 300 yards, right turn.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.142
I don't need to be told
how to get here.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.677
I'm already here.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.612
Next right, then right turn.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.882
Oh, God.
Now it's trying to make me
go back there a few yards.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.717
I was there!

06:25.085 --> 06:28.221
So, apart from a fiddly
and annoying satnav...

06:28.288 --> 06:30.824
SATNAV: Next right,
then right turn.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.462
JEREMY: ...what else
do you get for your Â£70,000?

06:36.196 --> 06:39.132
Er... Not much, really.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.368
Er... You don't get Wi-Fi

06:41.469 --> 06:43.937
or Apple CarPlay,
or gesture control.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.641
You don't even get
a DSG gearbox.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.077
Seats don't massage you
as you drive along,

06:50.143 --> 06:51.745
it can't park itself.

06:51.812 --> 06:52.613
Erm...

06:52.680 --> 06:55.282
But you do get a DVD player.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.785
And how 1996 is that?

06:59.319 --> 07:03.491
This car, then, is sparsely
equipped and annoying.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.794
However,
it's also rather good.

07:14.668 --> 07:18.105
First of all,
there's the engine.

07:18.171 --> 07:22.242
BMW and Mercedes
both use turbocharging

07:22.309 --> 07:23.811
to balance the need for power

07:23.877 --> 07:26.246
with the need
for good emissions...

07:26.313 --> 07:28.516
but this doesn't.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.552
This mixes the fuel
with the air,

07:31.619 --> 07:34.154
and then,
with no trickery at all,

07:34.221 --> 07:35.556
blows it up!

07:41.394 --> 07:43.564
Of course, that does mean

07:43.631 --> 07:45.666
the GS F
isn't very kind to animals.

07:45.733 --> 07:48.201
And that's a bad thing,
make no mistake.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.773
But on the upside,

07:52.840 --> 07:55.075
listen to the noise it makes!

07:59.580 --> 08:02.550
At medium revs,
it sounds baleful,

08:02.550 --> 08:04.985
like a... lonely dog.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.724
But when you build the revs up,
it sounds like what it is:

08:10.791 --> 08:14.828
a normally aspirated
five-litre V8.

08:18.298 --> 08:23.070
It doesn't produce anything
like the power or the torque

08:23.136 --> 08:25.873
you get from its turbocharged
German rivals,

08:25.939 --> 08:27.908
but for sheer excitement...

08:31.779 --> 08:34.181
It's like being tickled
by a goddess.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.154
And it's not exactly slow.

08:47.728 --> 08:52.232
It does 0-60
in four-and-a-half seconds.

08:52.299 --> 08:57.738
And flat out, it'll do
nearly 170 miles an hour.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.975
And then there's
the handling.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.849
It's hard to believe
that this is a large

09:08.916 --> 09:11.284
and extremely comfortable
five-seater

09:11.351 --> 09:14.121
with a boot that's big enough
for your golf bats

09:14.187 --> 09:17.324
and all your Freemasonry
paraphernalia,

09:17.390 --> 09:20.961
because...
it feels like a sports car.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.734
You can change the way
the car behaves

09:26.800 --> 09:29.870
with various knobs here
and buttons here,

09:29.937 --> 09:31.972
but I've got everything
turned off

09:32.039 --> 09:35.175
so I can get a feel
for how the car behaves

09:35.242 --> 09:39.379
without
an electronic safety blanket.

09:39.446 --> 09:40.948
And I like it!

10:01.101 --> 10:02.302
Look at that.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.204
The steering's not brilliant
at low speeds,

10:04.271 --> 10:06.774
but when you've got the arse
hanging out like that...

10:06.840 --> 10:08.241
it's fantastic!

10:11.945 --> 10:13.346
Yes!

10:13.413 --> 10:14.748
Time for another zesty drink.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.516
- Oh, damn it!

10:16.583 --> 10:19.753
- SATNAV: In 300 yards...
- I know where I am!

10:19.820 --> 10:21.889
Next right.
Then right turn.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.192
- Oh, for God's sake!

10:25.258 --> 10:27.761
For living with
on a day-to-day basis,

10:27.828 --> 10:30.230
German cars are far better.

10:30.297 --> 10:35.268
But as a driving machine,
and you may find this
conclusion surprising...

10:35.335 --> 10:38.872
I think the GS F
has them licked.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.918
Well, well.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.356
Now...

10:56.423 --> 11:01.561
Now, I should point out,
there is a new BMW M5
coming later this year,

11:01.628 --> 11:03.864
but it'll have to go some
to be better than that GS F.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.733
- It really will.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.736
But exactly how many
animals were harmed
in the making of it?

11:08.736 --> 11:11.338
- A lot!
- One of them was a tortoise!

11:11.404 --> 11:13.573
I know.
Let's gloss over that, OK?

11:13.640 --> 11:17.878
And let's find out now
how fast the Lexus
goes round the Eboladrome.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.848
And that, of course, means
handing it over to a man

11:20.914 --> 11:24.818
who thinks that fruit
is from the Soviet Union.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.754
- Yeah, it's the American.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.558
He's coiled and ready.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.126
And he's off!

11:33.193 --> 11:37.464
Unleashing all
the 471 wailing horsepower

11:37.530 --> 11:40.033
for the first sprint
of the Isn't Straight.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.903
What the hell does all
this shit do in here?

11:42.970 --> 11:45.839
All he needs
is two pedals and a wheel

11:45.906 --> 11:48.441
to unleash
the full shock and awe.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.243
Traction control?

11:50.310 --> 11:53.413
If you want something
with a mind of its own...

11:53.480 --> 11:55.682
get a horse, get married.

11:55.783 --> 11:58.986
Fortunately, he doesn't need
the electronic nannies.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.321
Pushing it hard
up to Your Name Here,

12:01.388 --> 12:04.892
and now leaning
on the mighty Brembo brakes.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.929
Gentle now,
letting the torque-vectoring
diff do its thing.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.563
And then back on the throttle

12:10.630 --> 12:14.802
so that mighty V8 can sing
its song once more.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.004
If they would have let me
bring my gun,

12:17.070 --> 12:19.139
I'd have probably
shot myself by now.

12:19.206 --> 12:22.042
And that would be a waste
of great talent.

12:22.109 --> 12:25.712
Right, another fast dash
up the Isn't,

12:25.813 --> 12:29.316
and now shifting rapidly down
the eight-speed automatic

12:29.382 --> 12:31.551
as he arrives
at Old Lady's House.

12:31.618 --> 12:35.522
Feeding it precisely through
there on this damp track,

12:35.588 --> 12:39.827
before opening it up
for the broken surface
down to Substation.

12:39.893 --> 12:43.563
Giving the fixed-rate dampers
a good workout here.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.498
Two corners left.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.167
Tidy through there.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.569
Just Field of Sheep to go.

12:49.636 --> 12:53.740
And he's right on the edge of
the grip and across the line!

12:56.109 --> 12:58.445
It did look good.
It did look good.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.413
- It did look good.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.015
A-ha!

13:02.082 --> 13:05.452
Well, now let's find out
where it goes
on the Lap Board.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.520
Remember, it was damp.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.588
Er...

13:08.655 --> 13:09.656
Oh... Oh.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.291
RICHARD: Oh, wow! Wow!

13:11.358 --> 13:14.294
So it's slower than
an already-out-of-date BMW,

13:14.361 --> 13:16.463
it makes you look like
a Freemason,

13:16.529 --> 13:18.531
and it causes animals
to explode.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.767
Yes. Yes, but--

13:20.868 --> 13:22.970
Yes, but it's just another
of your excellent
recommendations, Jeremy.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.737
Thank you very much.
Never mind.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.506
Yes, thank you
very much, indeed.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.241
And now we must move on,

13:28.308 --> 13:31.912
because it is time to set
the satnav for destination chat,

13:31.979 --> 13:34.982
as we head down
Conversation Street.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.897
- It hurt.

13:49.897 --> 13:54.501
- It hurt.
But not as much
as the wine bottle last week.

13:54.567 --> 13:58.605
Now, Mercedes, they've come up
with this plan, or this idea,

13:58.671 --> 14:02.742
where you can rent your car out
when you're not using it.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.045
Is that a bit like erm...
Airbnb?

14:05.112 --> 14:06.546
Exactly like Airbnb.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.349
The thing Mercedes
haven't realised is that we,

14:09.416 --> 14:11.118
and I'm sure
you all agree with me,

14:11.184 --> 14:13.486
we form an emotional bond
with our car.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.721
- We're attached to them.
- Exactly.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.123
So renting it to someone else

14:16.189 --> 14:17.991
would be like renting out
your pet.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.993
Yeah, or your penis.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.731
- Yes.
- I'm attached to it, I mean.
That's what I mean.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.566
One would hope so, yeah.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.835
You wouldn't want
to see somebody else
having fun with it.

14:28.936 --> 14:32.072
- No, it's mine!
- Exactly. Exactly.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.841
And that's what I'm on about.
Mercedes has obviously got it
into its head,

14:34.942 --> 14:37.810
and this really worries me,
because it's a large
car company,

14:37.945 --> 14:41.448
that cars are just tools,
like microwave ovens
or fridge freezers,

14:41.514 --> 14:44.417
that we'll just sort of
gladly, "Borrow it.
I don't really care."

14:44.484 --> 14:46.386
You're absolutely right.
They are very emotional.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.222
Because you know
if you have a car,
eventually you sell it,

14:49.289 --> 14:52.725
but then you see somebody
else driving around in it,
that always feels bad.

14:52.792 --> 14:56.729
It's a bit like watching
your ex-girlfriend do sex
with someone else.

14:58.865 --> 15:02.269
No. And after
a terrible evening
in a wardrobe, I know.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.973
It's strangely undermining.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.610
I'm sorry to interrupt.
See those circles
in the lake just there?

15:10.677 --> 15:13.580
- Monster! Monster!
It's a monster!

15:13.646 --> 15:17.684
- I just saw...
Did anyone else see that?
- Monster! Monster!

15:17.750 --> 15:19.719
It's real. I told you.

15:19.786 --> 15:22.822
Since we can't agree on this,
is there a monster
in the loch?

15:22.889 --> 15:24.491
AUDIENCE: Yes!

15:24.557 --> 15:27.327
Right, there you go.
They live here,
they would know.

15:27.394 --> 15:31.098
And if there were no monster,
what would you do for
a tourist industry up here?

15:31.164 --> 15:34.001
Sell tea towels
without monsters on them.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.669
No, I'm not having that,
because what you're saying is,

15:36.736 --> 15:39.572
"Come to beautiful Scotland."
As you've said, lovely roads,
lovely scenery.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.508
There's a hotel,
a beautiful lake.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.710
Why would they say,
"Yeah, but there's a monster"?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.578
That would be like saying,
"Come to Yorkshire.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.248
It's beautiful.
We've got the plague, you know?"

15:48.315 --> 15:50.550
- They they wouldn't do that.
- We've got distracted
a little bit.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.286
- We have got a bit off-topic.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.023
We were talking about him
hiding in a wardrobe,

15:56.023 --> 15:57.724
watching an ex-girlfriend
have sex.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.760
- Yeah, that was an over-share.
- It was a bit of an over-share.

16:00.827 --> 16:03.663
It was either that or he'd
rented his penis out.
I can't remember.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.365
Something along those lines.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.934
But actually, there's a point
I just want to make on this

16:08.035 --> 16:10.470
about this emotional
connection we have
with our cars.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.506
Cos you know
when you scrap a car?
It really is very tragic.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.676
When you watch a car that's
got all those shared memories
going into the crusher.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.378
- It's the end of the road.
- It is.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.513
There's this...
a new organisation.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.283
It's called Charity Car,
where you can give your car
to them,

16:23.350 --> 16:26.219
they deal with all the
paperwork and what have you
and take your car away.

16:26.286 --> 16:30.623
Yeah? And then they give
the money that they raised
to a charity of your choice.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.193
- That's a nice idea.
I like that.
- It is a nice idea.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.562
So that, you know,
it's sad your old car's gone,

16:35.628 --> 16:39.666
but now... you know,
a donkey can be rescued.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.935
And your car lives on
in the smile of
an abandoned donkey.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.838
That's a beautiful thing.
That's what we're about.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.975
- That's what this show is,
it's all heart.

16:49.076 --> 16:52.845
- It's what we are.
- Heart and road safety:
those are the two pillars

16:52.912 --> 16:55.848
that underpin everything,
really, on this show.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.650
- I've got some
conversation for you.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.087
Yes, which is that there's
a website that tells you

17:00.120 --> 17:01.788
how many
of any given type of car

17:01.854 --> 17:05.092
are still left on the roads
of Britain today, yes?

17:05.125 --> 17:07.894
And I'm afraid we have
some sad news.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.762
Yeah, we do.
This is a big worry.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.332
You remember
the CitroÃ«n Saxo VTS, yeah?
There it is.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.234
JEREMY:
The car of the angry yob.

17:14.301 --> 17:17.404
RICHARD:
It is the ideal car to nip
out and steal a chainsaw in.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.507
A fabulous, proper, fizzy
little hatchback. Loved it.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.643
Well, in 2008, there were
5,000 of them on the road.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.180
- This year, 491 left
on the road.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.349
And, in fact...
I know, this is a worry.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.718
Look, we've got a little chart.
We've drawn this up.

17:31.784 --> 17:35.688
At that rate, by 2019,
they'll all have gone.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.658
There's also
the Vauxhall Calibra 16V.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.360
There's a picture.
We used to love that.

17:40.427 --> 17:44.797
Do you know, there are
only 323 of those left,

17:44.864 --> 17:47.834
and they could be extinct
within a year.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.903
And what's interesting
is there are people
all over the world

17:50.970 --> 17:55.475
working hard to save the tiger
from extinction,

17:55.542 --> 17:57.144
but nobody is doing anything

17:57.144 --> 17:59.546
to save
the Vauxhall Calibra 16V.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.681
- We've identified
something here.
- No, there isn't.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.051
However, there is some
good news in all of this.
The Morris Ital.

18:05.152 --> 18:08.788
175,000 of these...

18:08.855 --> 18:11.258
turds were made,

18:11.324 --> 18:13.893
were squeezed out
by the Austin.

18:13.960 --> 18:19.466
And in 2015,
there were only 35 left.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.602
- Yes! Now you can cheer!

18:22.669 --> 18:25.172
- That is good news.
- It's good news.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.640
Only 35 on the road.

18:27.707 --> 18:31.578
No. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're absolutely right.

18:31.644 --> 18:36.483
But before you celebrate,
yes, 35 left on the road
in 2015.

18:36.549 --> 18:40.453
- Mm-hm.
- In 2016... there were 47.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.322
What, so they're going up?

18:42.389 --> 18:45.225
- No. No.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.093
I think people
are restoring them.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.262
- Mad people.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.898
Anyway, look...
No, you're possibly right,
but I've done a calculation.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.302
And at that rate...
That's a 34% increase
in just one year.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.538
And at that rate,
by the year 2044,

18:58.605 --> 19:04.076
all 175,000 Morris Itals
will be back on the road.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.845
- Oh, my God!
- This is a disaster.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.815
It is. That, ladies
and gentlemen, is Brexit.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.353
That's what they want:
backwards with Britain.

19:13.420 --> 19:17.224
It is time now,
since we've reached the end
of Conversation Street,

19:17.257 --> 19:19.091
to select reverse
and have a look at this.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.761
This is the Bentley Bentayga.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.465
A massive, luxurious,
four-wheel-drive

19:25.532 --> 19:27.667
SUV shooting brake.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.236
The question is,

19:29.269 --> 19:32.239
is it any good,
or is it a load of...

19:33.139 --> 19:34.507
What's the word?

19:40.980 --> 19:44.417
Well, to find out,
James brought it here...

19:44.484 --> 19:46.286
to the German Alps.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.123
Right, I'll get straight
to the point.

19:51.258 --> 19:54.594
It is tremendous.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.464
The important thing
to remember about
this car is this.

19:57.530 --> 20:01.200
It's not an off-roader,
it's not an SUV.

20:01.200 --> 20:01.268
It's not an off-roader,
it's not an SUV.
First and foremost,
it's a Bentley.

20:01.268 --> 20:04.304
First and foremost,
it's a Bentley.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.972
That's what this car
is about.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.309
I'm already loving it.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.813
But then... guess what?

20:13.880 --> 20:16.883
The problem is
that a barebones Bentley

20:16.949 --> 20:20.186
costs Â£160,000,

20:20.253 --> 20:23.290
and for Â£12,000 less
than that,

20:23.356 --> 20:24.591
you can have this.

20:27.026 --> 20:30.997
An all-singing, all-dancing,
everything-fitted-as-standard

20:31.063 --> 20:33.800
5L supercharged Range Rover.

20:33.866 --> 20:39.038
Or, for Â£120,000 less
than that, you can have this,

20:39.105 --> 20:40.873
the new Jaguar F-PACE.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.613
And it's not like this thing
is a garden shed.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.415
It's got loads
of clever stuff on it.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.216
So if you're coming back
from the shops

20:50.283 --> 20:51.851
with your arms
full of heavy bags,

20:51.918 --> 20:54.321
you can open the boot
with your foot.

20:54.387 --> 20:58.358
- Yeah, but I can do that
with a Range Rover.
- Yes, but it's Â£120,000 more!

20:58.425 --> 21:01.628
- And you don't get
one of these. Look.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.531
It's a waterproof,
go-anywhere bracelet

21:04.597 --> 21:07.400
that you use to lock...

21:07.467 --> 21:08.801
and unlock it,
and start the engine,

21:08.868 --> 21:11.738
so you don't need to carry keys
in your pocket.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.506
That...

21:13.573 --> 21:16.376
- That's actually
quite a good idea.
- I know, it's brilliant.

21:16.443 --> 21:19.211
- I don't know. Maybe it's
like one of those watches.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.049
Oh, hello.
- Oh.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.051
JEREMY:
Puff Daddy is arriving.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.720
- Do you think
he's wearing a chain?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.657
You know, that thing costs
four times more than the Jag.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.092
And it's not like the badges
are that different.

21:33.159 --> 21:36.596
That Jag is... a car.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.798
This is more of a statement.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.500
This is a new way
of understanding

21:40.567 --> 21:41.734
the condition of being human.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.470
It is the last word
in luxury.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.438
RICHARD: It's a very
expensive statement, though.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.775
I mean, if you've got
the money to buy that,
you could buy the Jag

21:48.841 --> 21:52.044
and still have Â£130,000
to spend on a PR agent

21:52.111 --> 21:54.781
to put you on breakfast TV
talking about how great you are.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.916
It costs Â£130,000 more
for a reason.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.151
Jags are for deluded
middle-aged men

21:59.218 --> 22:01.754
who entertain tragic fantasies
about being Lotharios.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.856
I know,
I've had four of them!

22:03.923 --> 22:06.393
If you're talking about
brands with delusion - hello!

22:06.459 --> 22:08.194
- Bentley, that's what it is.
- Guys.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.398
- We are not gonna
sort this out in a car park.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.833
We need to go for a drive,

22:13.900 --> 22:17.604
and I have worked out a route
on this map here, OK?

22:17.670 --> 22:20.873
We are in the village of...
Wank,

22:20.940 --> 22:25.412
and we'll go from...
Wank to Kissing,

22:25.412 --> 22:27.414
then on to Petting.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.616
Then... this place.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.485
And then... Wedding.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.888
So, Wank, Kissing, Petting,
, Wedding.

22:35.955 --> 22:41.694
Yes. It'll be a journey
through life without
leaving Central Europe.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.730
Yeah, it will. Let's do it.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.598
RICHARD: Very excited,

22:45.665 --> 22:50.503
we set off
on what the Germans call
the Romantic Road.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.976
So, we are leaving
the town of Wank.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.245
What's that?
"Thank you for..."

22:59.311 --> 23:00.947
What? Oh, yeah.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.554
And after just a few minutes,

23:07.620 --> 23:10.823
something very unusual
happened.

23:12.258 --> 23:13.693
Guys...

23:13.760 --> 23:15.695
I can't think of
anything to say.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.364
What a relief.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.032
No, but I really can't,

23:20.099 --> 23:24.270
because if you want
a large, luxury off-roader,

23:24.336 --> 23:25.805
you buy a Range Rover.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.039
The end.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.041
The end, move on.

23:31.478 --> 23:32.812
RICHARD: James, however,

23:32.879 --> 23:36.549
had lots to say
about his Bentayga.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.950
Hey, chaps, did you know

23:38.017 --> 23:41.654
the stereo in my car
has got 18 speakers?

23:41.721 --> 23:44.624
Is that all? Mine's got 27.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.526
Yeah, all playing rubbish.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.629
Thanks, Hammond.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.798
Actually, 27 speakers
is not the point.

23:51.864 --> 23:56.736
My car stereo
produces 1,950W,

23:56.803 --> 24:00.573
making it the most powerful
stereo ever put in a car.

24:00.640 --> 24:05.745
In fact, it's about
the only thing in here
that does make a noise.

24:05.812 --> 24:09.982
This is a little bit like
driving along
in the British Library.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.719
It's very quiet,
it's very refined.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.788
The carpets are very thick.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.357
Which means you simply
aren't ready for what happens

24:18.424 --> 24:20.560
when you put your foot down.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.698
Whoa!

24:25.765 --> 24:31.070
So this has an all-new
W12 600-horsepower engine,

24:31.137 --> 24:34.907
and it's like being
in a leather-trimmed
volcanic eruption.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.811
It doesn't accelerate,
it goes off.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.316
Bloody Nora!

24:44.383 --> 24:49.722
Sadly, at this point, Jeremy
thought of something to say.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.558
See that?
That's the prison

24:51.558 --> 24:54.026
where Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.

24:56.763 --> 24:58.898
Yeah. Where are you going
with that?

25:01.768 --> 25:03.435
Nowhere, really.

25:03.570 --> 25:06.105
Just thought
you might like to know.

25:06.172 --> 25:09.408
Good.
Let's get back to the cars.

25:09.475 --> 25:12.679
Now, you might be thinking
that because Jaguar is owned
by the same company

25:12.745 --> 25:17.717
that own Land Rover,
this is just a Freelander
with a Jaguar badge on it,

25:17.784 --> 25:19.051
but it's not.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.889
Underneath is the same
basic aluminium structure

25:22.955 --> 25:25.024
you find under a Jaguar XE,

25:25.091 --> 25:28.861
which is a fantastic car,
so that's good.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.631
I do only get
a 3L supercharged V6,

25:31.698 --> 25:34.801
which means
375 brake horsepower.

25:34.867 --> 25:39.171
That's 225 less than James's,
let's be honest,

25:39.238 --> 25:40.840
leather-lined Audi Q7.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.610
But this is light,

25:43.676 --> 25:45.745
so it ain't no slouch.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.316
I like the way this thing
handles itself.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.619
I like the way,
when you change direction,

25:52.685 --> 25:54.687
when you turn,
it controls its weight,

25:54.754 --> 25:56.856
what there is of it,
across the axles.

25:56.923 --> 26:00.259
That makes it feel nimble,
eager.

26:00.326 --> 26:04.296
It doesn't feel like
I'm sitting in a stately home
falling off a cliff.

26:07.767 --> 26:10.637
Soon, James was in my way.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.140
Oh, look.

26:14.206 --> 26:17.009
James, you should be
where I am. You can see
Buckingham Palace and...

26:17.076 --> 26:19.411
Oh, no,
it's the back of your car.

26:19.478 --> 26:23.850
I like it when my man is
following me. Do you have
the luggage for the weekend?

26:26.418 --> 26:28.655
Come on, James.

26:28.655 --> 26:32.324
You might have all
the horsepower in the world,
but you are in the way.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.930
Stay with that,
Birmingham boy.

26:46.238 --> 26:50.142
James, are you worried all
your furniture will slide
about if you go any faster?

26:55.447 --> 26:57.083
Oh, tunnel.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.418
Excellent.
I have important work to do.

27:08.027 --> 27:11.698
Honestly, the plebs make such
a noise about everything.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.966
RICHARD: That is putting
the S back in SUV.

27:14.033 --> 27:17.003
This is a sporty
sports-utility vehicle.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.407
And the sport is not fishing.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.844
RICHARD: Sadly, our playtime
was then interrupted

27:24.911 --> 27:27.213
by a worrying call
from Clarkson.

27:27.279 --> 27:31.884
JEREMY:
Erm... guys, we've had
a text from Mr Wilman.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.620
Oh, God. What does it say?

27:34.721 --> 27:38.157
JEREMY:
It said that to sort out
the performance differences,

27:38.224 --> 27:40.359
we should go to
a nearby airstrip,

27:40.426 --> 27:43.129
where he'd laid on
some competition.

27:44.596 --> 27:45.898
So we did.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.442
Chaps, this is what
we're up against.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.545
BMW X5 M.

27:59.611 --> 28:03.015
4.4L, twin-turbocharged,
567 horsepower.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.351
That is fairly serious
competition.

28:05.417 --> 28:09.355
If you think about it,
it's gonna be Britain
versus Germany.

28:09.421 --> 28:12.992
Well, not really.
Your two cars are Indian
and mine's German as well.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.161
All right, it's gonna be
India versus Germany,

28:15.227 --> 28:19.231
and I shall be victorious
in my mighty lighty Jaguar.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.600
- JAMES: Right.
- JEREMY: Well, you see,
you won't be.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.770
Not in a million years.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.813
Sorry about wasting your time
with this race.

28:35.782 --> 28:38.951
You could launch a car that
does a million miles an hour

28:39.018 --> 28:40.987
and costs 8p
and runs on water,

28:41.053 --> 28:43.589
and people would still buy
Range Rovers,

28:43.655 --> 28:46.993
because why would you not?

28:47.059 --> 28:49.829
RICHARD:
OK, air-conditioning is off.

28:49.896 --> 28:54.366
It's in dynamic mode,
gearbox is in sport.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.502
Come on, little Jag.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.438
So I'm not really worried
about Pinky and Perky's
challenge,

28:59.505 --> 29:01.808
but the BMW does worry me.

29:01.841 --> 29:05.878
Almost as much power,
very obviously lighter.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.014
A lot of well-to-do people
in Britain

29:08.080 --> 29:10.116
will want to know
the result of this race

29:10.182 --> 29:12.919
before they choose
what colour Range Rover
they'd like

29:12.985 --> 29:15.287
for next year's
shooting season.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.978
Where's the Bentley gone?

29:42.081 --> 29:43.449
I'm losing, everybody.

29:45.852 --> 29:47.854
Come on!

29:47.887 --> 29:49.255
150... Oh, no!

29:49.321 --> 29:51.858
Oh, no! Where is he
getting that from?

29:53.425 --> 29:54.861
Easy.

29:59.999 --> 30:03.202
Last. Stone-dead last.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.172
Bugger it.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.308
Yes, yes. Well done, James.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.178
Oh, who knew, if you spend
four times as much on a car,

30:12.244 --> 30:14.513
you get one that's a tiny bit
faster than another?

30:14.580 --> 30:17.917
Ssh! You two just haven't got
the message, have you?

30:17.984 --> 30:21.287
- Yeah. Well...

30:21.353 --> 30:23.956
No, the message is very clear.
Underpants, OK?

30:24.023 --> 30:26.692
You can buy a cheap pair
from a market stall,

30:26.758 --> 30:30.396
or you can buy
an expensive pair
with gold thread in them,

30:30.462 --> 30:34.100
or you can do what
everyone does, you go
to Marks & Spencer's.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.235
Marks & Spencer's,
if you're watching this
not in the UK,

30:36.302 --> 30:38.537
is where we all
buy our pants from.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.006
Well, I don't.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.145
JEREMY: After the race,
we resumed our journey,

30:46.212 --> 30:50.249
and Richard and James
resumed their bickering.

30:50.316 --> 30:54.686
JAMES OVER RADIO: What does
F It sounds like
a domestic cleaning product.

30:54.753 --> 30:57.689
I think your Bentley
would look better
with alabaster lions

30:57.756 --> 30:59.858
instead of door mirrors.

30:59.926 --> 31:03.462
I was going to ask if
the glovebox is permanently
locked shut in the Jag,

31:03.529 --> 31:05.597
because that's where you keep
your wallet.

31:05.664 --> 31:08.534
RICHARD OVER RADIO:
The front of your Bentley
looks silly.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.236
It just looks a bit daft.

31:10.302 --> 31:14.106
And why was it you didn't get
Brian Sewell's old job?

31:14.173 --> 31:16.943
Does the options list
for your Bentley Bentayga

31:16.976 --> 31:21.013
include oil paintings
of imaginary ancestors?

31:21.080 --> 31:23.449
I apologise for the noises
these two are making.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.684
I realise you're all
sitting at home going,

31:25.751 --> 31:30.089
"What are they on about?
I just want the Range Rover."
Of course you do.

31:30.156 --> 31:34.160
The only reason you'd buy
the Bentley is cos your hip-hop
record's gone to number one,

31:34.226 --> 31:38.430
and the only reason you'd buy
the Jag is cos you can't
afford a Range Rover.

31:40.832 --> 31:44.971
RICHARD:
Since Jeremy had brought up
the subject of money...

31:44.971 --> 31:49.841
I don't know
how they can sell you one
of these for from 34 grand.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.443
And this one,
with everything on it,

31:51.510 --> 31:54.280
quite apart from
a V6 supercharged engine,

31:54.346 --> 31:56.882
it's got leather everything,
iPhone connectivity,

31:56.983 --> 32:01.087
radar-distance control,
voice control, electric boot,

32:01.153 --> 32:02.989
magic key
you wear on your wrist.

32:02.989 --> 32:06.325
All of that
still only costs 51 grand.
How do they do that?

32:06.392 --> 32:11.130
Next to everything else,
it suddenly looks like
the bargain of the century.

32:11.197 --> 32:14.033
OVER RADIO:
Jeremy, this car
is better than yours.

32:14.100 --> 32:17.836
Well, now,
it just isn't, is it?

32:17.903 --> 32:20.372
You're being a...
What's the word?

32:27.413 --> 32:30.216
We then flashed through
the village of Kissing,

32:30.282 --> 32:32.651
getting it over with
as quickly as possible.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.688
Then we went through Petting.

32:36.755 --> 32:39.858
And to make sure
we reached erm...

32:39.925 --> 32:42.194
third base before bedtime,

32:42.261 --> 32:45.397
we decided
to set our satnavs.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.800
SATNAV:
Please name the country.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.302
JAMES: Austria.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.703
SATNAV:
Please name the city.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.640
Foo-cking.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.376
SATNAV: Excuse me?

33:00.212 --> 33:01.713
(MUTTERS PLACE NAME
UNDER BREATH)

33:01.780 --> 33:03.482
SATNAV: Sorry?

33:03.549 --> 33:05.517
- (MUTTERS PLACE NAME
UNDER BREATH)

33:05.584 --> 33:07.519
(MUTTERS PLACE NAME
WITH A COUGH)

33:07.586 --> 33:09.355
SATNAV: Sorry?

33:09.421 --> 33:12.624
SATNAV: Is your destination
Selking?

33:12.691 --> 33:16.195
No. Foo-cking.

33:16.262 --> 33:20.466
SATNAV:
Kraking has been accepted.
Which street should I select?

33:20.532 --> 33:22.068
(MUTTERS PLACE NAME
WITH A COUGH)

33:23.635 --> 33:25.204
SATNAV: Sorry?

33:25.271 --> 33:28.607
I can't say it.
People are listening.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.643
- (MUTTERS PLACE NAME
WITH A COUGH)

33:31.710 --> 33:34.213
Thankfully, Hammond
had decided to program

33:34.280 --> 33:37.483
his bargain-basement system
manually.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.386
F.

33:40.452 --> 33:41.420
U.

33:44.656 --> 33:45.657
K.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.863
It's gone in!

33:51.930 --> 33:56.402
RICHARD: And soon, we crossed
the border into Austria.

33:56.468 --> 33:59.138
It's very, very pretty,
Austria.

34:00.506 --> 34:03.442
No idea why Hitler
was in such a bad mood.

34:06.212 --> 34:08.614
Eventually, we arrived...

34:08.680 --> 34:10.116
erm...

34:10.116 --> 34:12.418
here.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.621
So is this the climax
of this stage of our journey?

34:15.687 --> 34:18.023
JEREMY: Is it all
it's cracked up to be?

34:18.124 --> 34:20.126
That's what I want to know.

34:20.126 --> 34:23.762
Cos often it can be
a disappointment,
the first time you go there.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.665
The first time I came here,
I couldn't find the way in.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.137
JEREMY:
Once we'd arrived in...

34:33.339 --> 34:34.973
...James was very keen

34:35.040 --> 34:39.378
we should get in the back
of his Bentley.

34:39.445 --> 34:43.249
What's really incongruous
about this is that you're
very obviously in a Bentley.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.184
All this looks very Bentley,

34:45.251 --> 34:48.587
until you look down here
and see these symbols
on this control knob,

34:48.654 --> 34:51.357
and it's very obviously
a serious off-roader.

34:51.423 --> 34:52.791
Oh, what, those symbols?

34:52.858 --> 34:54.260
So you can set it for

34:54.326 --> 34:57.028
swamp, minefield,
Christmas or Mexico? Nice.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.631
- Yes, Hammond.
- Shall I tell you something
interesting about the wood,

34:59.698 --> 35:01.400
or one of the woods
you can have in this?

35:01.467 --> 35:04.603
It only grows on a cliff face
in Asia,

35:04.670 --> 35:08.507
and the way they get it is
they have to abseil down it
with their woodworking tools.

35:08.574 --> 35:12.311
Why don't they just use
wood from a tree that
grows in a field?

35:12.378 --> 35:14.380
Is everything standard
in here?

35:14.446 --> 35:15.614
- No.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.417
- No.

35:18.484 --> 35:19.685
- Yes.

35:19.751 --> 35:22.521
- Is 212,000 and something.

35:22.588 --> 35:25.657
So that means
the extras in this car

35:25.724 --> 35:29.761
cost more than Hammond's
entire Jaguar?

35:29.828 --> 35:32.030
- About the same.

35:32.097 --> 35:35.267
- What, that Jag
with all the extras?
- That is Â£51,450.

35:35.334 --> 35:39.037
And this has got Â£52,000
worth of extras in it?

35:39.104 --> 35:43.375
It's just a little bit more
on extras than the entire Jag.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.477
It's great... value.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.913
- JEREMY: Can I just say,
James...
- Yes, do.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.950
...I do quite like
the interior of this car.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.720
No, I do. I'll be honest.
I like the quilted leather,

35:54.786 --> 35:58.557
I like the wood that comes
from a cliff and all of that.

35:58.624 --> 36:01.026
But the exterior,
I'm sorry, it's hideous.

36:01.092 --> 36:03.995
- Ugly. Pig ugly.
- Yeah, well,
hang on a minute.

36:04.062 --> 36:07.333
Because, do you remember,
and it is a long time ago,

36:07.399 --> 36:09.100
when the Continental GT
first came out,

36:09.235 --> 36:10.436
we all thought
that was hideous...

36:10.502 --> 36:12.704
- It was.
- ...and now we all love it.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.740
- It's one of the few things
we agree on.
- Yes. Yes, that's true.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.875
But I think this is
more like you.

36:16.942 --> 36:20.145
When I first met you,
I thought you were ugly.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.614
And now
I still think you're ugly.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.317
A crushing criticism
from one so handsome.

36:32.791 --> 36:33.959
Unlock the doors.

36:36.328 --> 36:37.929
James,
please unlock the doors.

36:39.398 --> 36:41.567
We're in... this place.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.502
RICHARD:
In the back of a car,

36:44.403 --> 36:45.571
together.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.578
It is remarkable, isn't it?
All those places...

36:52.644 --> 36:55.281
I'm sure... All those
place names are real.

36:55.281 --> 36:57.983
- They are real.
Yeah, real places.
- They really are.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.586
Those place names are real.

37:00.652 --> 37:03.455
Anyway, we'll pick up
that pointless test later on.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.357
- It's not pointless!
- Yes, it is.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.759
I already explained it
perfectly well with
the underpants thing.

37:07.826 --> 37:11.196
And I shall be explaining
using more demonstrations
later on.

37:11.297 --> 37:14.065
- Oh, good.
- But now it is time

37:14.132 --> 37:16.201
for Celebrity Brain Crash!

37:24.976 --> 37:28.013
Now, our guest...

37:28.079 --> 37:29.681
our guest today,

37:29.748 --> 37:31.917
he directed Batman,
Planet Of The Apes,

37:31.983 --> 37:33.319
Edward Scissorhands.

37:33.352 --> 37:36.221
And, after last week's
mine disaster,

37:36.322 --> 37:40.559
he's decided to come to the
studio underneath the mines

37:40.626 --> 37:42.561
in a miniature submarine.

37:42.628 --> 37:45.831
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tim Burton!

37:47.799 --> 37:50.502
Here is the submarine.
There he is,

37:50.569 --> 37:53.339
sneaking underneath
the mines.

37:53.339 --> 37:56.207
- RICHARD: Clever.
- JEREMY: As he heads
cleverly towards us.

37:56.342 --> 37:59.110
- He's out there somewhere.
- He's out there somewhere.
This is fantastic.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.613
- What are we gonna
talk to him about?
- There's so much.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.350
- JAMES: About The Nightmare
Before Christmas.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.352
It's my favourite
Christmas film.

38:06.418 --> 38:09.555
JEREMY: Is it? I want
to know what it's like
to work with Johnny Depp.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.923
RICHARD: Yeah, there's a lot
to talk to him about.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.059
JEREMY: Oh, hello.

38:14.125 --> 38:17.496
We've lost the feed somehow
from the sub.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.365
Oh, God Almight...
Oh, my God!

38:19.398 --> 38:21.867
- RICHARD: Oh, no!

38:23.101 --> 38:25.371
Oh!

38:25.437 --> 38:29.475
There's obviously been
a catastrophic failure
with the submarine.

38:29.541 --> 38:32.844
- No idea what
could have caused it.
- The monster's bitten it!

38:34.813 --> 38:36.882
For the hundredth time,
Hammond,

38:36.948 --> 38:40.386
there is no such thing
as the Loch Ness Monster.

38:42.954 --> 38:45.391
- Does that mean
he's not coming on, then?

38:45.391 --> 38:48.894
Well, James, his lungs
have filled with icy water,
he's sunk to the bottom,

38:48.960 --> 38:52.398
and his body is being
compressed to the size
of a Ping-Pong ball.

38:52.431 --> 38:53.865
So that is a no.

38:53.932 --> 38:57.135
It's OK, though, because
we have a back-up plan.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.106
You see, the thing is,
these days,

39:01.172 --> 39:04.676
- a lot of performance cars
have launch control.
- Ah, yes. Yes.

39:04.743 --> 39:08.580
The way it works is you put
your foot on the throttle
and brake at the same time,

39:08.647 --> 39:12.584
and the car's computer
works out exactly
how many revs you need

39:12.651 --> 39:15.120
and exactly how much
wheelspin to give the car

39:15.186 --> 39:17.255
so that you get
an absolutely perfect start

39:17.322 --> 39:19.558
as soon as you just
take your foot off the brake.

39:19.625 --> 39:23.028
Yeah, and we were wondering,
just when exactly
can you use that?

39:23.094 --> 39:25.564
If you're in a town centre
at a set of lights going...

39:27.833 --> 39:29.435
- It's a bit rude.

39:29.435 --> 39:32.438
It is,
as this short film explains.

39:47.285 --> 39:50.288
Coconut-milk latte
with a caramel shot, please.

39:50.355 --> 39:52.824
- OK, a coconut-milk latte
with a caramel--

41:02.594 --> 41:04.696
- Pointless.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.900
The thing is, you can't...

41:08.967 --> 41:11.770
you can't even use launch
control on a race track,

41:11.837 --> 41:14.973
because you can only engage it
for three or four seconds
before it cuts out.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.976
And because you don't know
when the lights are gonna
go green,

41:18.043 --> 41:20.546
you don't know when
your three seconds
start, do you?

41:20.612 --> 41:22.013
Exactly, which is why
we have decided

41:22.080 --> 41:25.216
it is the most pointless
invention ever.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.152
Yes, and talking of pointless,

41:27.218 --> 41:29.154
let's get back to our film.

41:29.220 --> 41:32.858
Er... We're road-testing
a Range Rover
and some other cars.

41:32.924 --> 41:36.294
We began in the
German village of Wank,

41:36.361 --> 41:39.197
and the plan was to go
through Kissing and Petting

41:39.264 --> 41:41.867
towards Wedding,
which was our destination.

41:41.933 --> 41:46.204
Yes, and we pick up
the action having decided
to spend the night in Fu--

41:50.576 --> 41:54.880
We woke the next morning
in this dew-kissed village.

41:56.915 --> 41:59.484
And over
a rather awkward breakfast,

41:59.585 --> 42:01.820
Clarkson made
an announcement.

42:04.990 --> 42:09.661
I don't mean to be hurtful
or disrespectful,

42:09.728 --> 42:11.997
but erm...

42:12.063 --> 42:14.499
- Go on, spit it out.
- Well, it's...

42:14.600 --> 42:16.267
just because we've been here,

42:16.334 --> 42:19.605
doesn't mean we necessarily
have to go on to Wedding.

42:19.638 --> 42:20.806
Aw!

42:20.872 --> 42:24.409
It's me, it's not you.

42:24.475 --> 42:27.846
No, he's right.
It's been going so well.

42:27.913 --> 42:29.648
And if we go on to Wedding,

42:29.715 --> 42:33.251
we'll have to carry on
and on and on,

42:33.318 --> 42:36.521
through Routine, Boredom,

42:36.622 --> 42:39.357
Resentment, Spare Bedroom,

42:39.424 --> 42:41.392
Temptation, Affair,

42:41.459 --> 42:44.730
Discovery, Remorse, Revenge,

42:44.796 --> 42:47.165
Divorce, and then it's Death.

42:47.232 --> 42:50.969
Or you could turn off
through Online Dating,

42:51.036 --> 42:53.639
Meaningless Sex,
Bottomless Regret,

42:53.672 --> 42:56.074
Financial Ruination,
and then Heart Attack.

42:56.141 --> 42:58.409
And then you end up
at Death anyway.

42:58.476 --> 43:01.680
Exactly, Hammond.
And that's why I'm suggesting

43:01.747 --> 43:05.050
that instead of going
to... Wedding,

43:05.116 --> 43:06.985
we go to the NÃ¼rburgring.

43:09.020 --> 43:12.824
JEREMY: Because James's car
was the only one
that spoke German,

43:12.891 --> 43:14.860
he set the satnav.

43:14.926 --> 43:18.196
Ziel eingeben: NÃ¼rburgring.

43:18.263 --> 43:21.767
- JEREMY: And then we set off.

43:28.373 --> 43:30.575
Soon, we were on
Germany's Autobahns,

43:30.676 --> 43:35.681
which got us thinking about
how sensible they are.

43:35.747 --> 43:38.049
And here we are
on the Autobahn.

43:38.116 --> 43:39.517
No speed limits.

43:39.584 --> 43:41.787
Is it chaos? No.

43:42.988 --> 43:45.056
If you remove
the speed limits,

43:45.123 --> 43:49.828
people don't all suddenly
drive into bridge supports
at 200 miles an hour.

43:49.895 --> 43:54.700
We're not that stupid.
Just as if you leave
the gate unlocked

43:54.700 --> 43:56.367
at the lion closure
at a safari park,

43:56.434 --> 43:59.304
we don't all run in
and have a picnic.

44:01.306 --> 44:06.778
In the last 15 years,
Britain's economy
has grown by 58%,

44:06.845 --> 44:10.381
whereas Germany's
has grown by 102%.

44:10.448 --> 44:15.086
And that's because we're
all doing 20 miles an hour
and they're doing 200.

44:16.154 --> 44:18.857
Speed is good for business,

44:18.924 --> 44:21.492
and it saves lives as well.

44:21.559 --> 44:23.929
Because when we drive
down the motorway in Britain,

44:23.995 --> 44:26.765
we're looking at all
the gantries to see if they
have speed cameras,

44:26.832 --> 44:31.069
or we're looking at our
speedometers to make sure
we're not breaking the limit.

44:31.136 --> 44:33.338
We're not looking
where we're going.

44:33.404 --> 44:37.142
Heavily enforced
speed limits kill people.

44:38.810 --> 44:40.545
The Autobahn
also got us thinking

44:40.611 --> 44:44.950
about how times have changed
on the SUV front.

44:46.151 --> 44:48.754
It is amazing, really,
that an off-road vehicle

44:48.787 --> 44:50.321
can feel this stable,

44:50.388 --> 44:52.557
this planted,
I think the word is.

44:52.623 --> 44:54.325
Because it's not
that long ago,

44:54.392 --> 44:56.762
if you think about early
Range Rovers and the like,

44:56.795 --> 44:58.764
going fast was actually
quite frightening.

44:58.830 --> 45:02.233
They had stickers
on the sun visors,
do you remember,

45:02.300 --> 45:03.969
with a picture of the car
toppling over.

45:04.035 --> 45:06.071
"Avoid sudden swerves."

45:06.137 --> 45:08.006
Yes, I'd completely forgotten

45:08.073 --> 45:09.908
about that sticker,
but you're right, it did.

45:09.975 --> 45:14.145
"If you operate
the steering wheel,
this vehicle will fall over."

45:18.784 --> 45:20.185
There are no speed limits,
right?

45:20.251 --> 45:23.221
So we are allowed to go
as fast as our cars will go.

45:23.288 --> 45:26.057
But who dares
actually do that?

45:26.124 --> 45:28.426
Who dares go the fastest?

45:28.493 --> 45:32.230
Right, if we're
going to play that game,
I might even join in.

45:32.297 --> 45:33.932
Bang on.

45:33.999 --> 45:35.266
RICHARD:
Go on, James. Help yourself.

45:38.303 --> 45:42.808
- There you go, 187, top speed.

45:42.808 --> 45:47.312
The thing is, you were
behind me when you started
and you still are behind me.

45:47.378 --> 45:50.816
- I did 190.
- Oh, for God's sake!
You didn't.

45:50.882 --> 45:53.318
That's faster
than your car will go.

45:54.853 --> 45:57.555
RICHARD: In order to put
a stop to this nonsense,

45:57.622 --> 46:00.491
I made us pull in
at the next service station.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.095
Right, small cameras.

46:04.162 --> 46:06.231
We fix these to the dash
where they can see the speedo,

46:06.297 --> 46:08.934
and then there's no cheating.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.568
Why have you got a dog?

46:10.635 --> 46:12.838
I shall show you.
Follow me.

46:14.505 --> 46:16.307
If you want a pet,

46:16.374 --> 46:18.109
you can have
something expensive,

46:18.176 --> 46:20.078
like an iguana
with a silver necklace.

46:20.145 --> 46:22.848
Or you can have something cheap,
like an ant.

46:22.848 --> 46:24.749
- That ant.

46:24.850 --> 46:29.454
Or you can use your common
sense and have a labradog.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.264
With my clever
demonstration over,

46:39.330 --> 46:40.966
we got back on the motorway

46:41.032 --> 46:45.070
and mounted Hammond's
honesty cameras.

46:45.136 --> 46:47.873
I've got a good way
of cheating still.

46:47.873 --> 46:50.976
Because if I push
this button here, watch,

46:51.042 --> 46:53.912
my speedometer changes
to kilometres an hour.

46:53.979 --> 46:55.446
He'll never know.

46:55.513 --> 46:57.382
And Jeremy, while you're
setting your camera up,

46:57.448 --> 47:00.551
don't think about changing
your display to km/h

47:00.618 --> 47:02.487
so you get a bigger number.

47:08.960 --> 47:12.964
JEREMY: It was now time
to begin the speed trials.

47:17.903 --> 47:20.005
Here we go.
Going for a big one.

47:20.071 --> 47:23.274
Into a world of speed
and glory!

47:24.642 --> 47:27.078
Come on, Audi.
You must be able to see me.

47:28.079 --> 47:29.580
Come on, come on, come on.

47:31.516 --> 47:34.585
Out of the way.
And you in the Audi. Come on.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.455
As the traffic eased,

47:37.522 --> 47:41.426
Hammond was knocking on
the door of 150 miles an hour.

47:42.627 --> 47:44.963
That's 148.

47:45.030 --> 47:46.397
Forty-nine.

47:46.464 --> 47:48.934
JEREMY: And I, too,
was getting close.

47:48.967 --> 47:51.702
150 coming up.
150 any minute now.

47:51.769 --> 47:56.641
Come on, stretch it,
stretch it, stretch it,
stretch it, stretch it.

47:56.707 --> 48:00.178
Sadly, it was hard to say
how fast James was going,

48:00.245 --> 48:01.612
because he's an imbecile.

48:08.686 --> 48:11.556
Oh, yeah!
That big number's coming up.

48:12.623 --> 48:14.359
Got to beat 151.

48:16.461 --> 48:17.562
JEREMY: Shit!

48:17.628 --> 48:20.365
Why won't it go
any faster than that?

48:20.431 --> 48:22.533
Come on!

48:22.600 --> 48:25.470
Why won't you go any faster
than 148?

48:34.645 --> 48:38.616
Eventually, heavy traffic
ended this important test.

48:41.286 --> 48:42.887
Right,
as we are in a traffic jam,

48:42.988 --> 48:46.992
I may as well give you
the results of Who Dares Wins.

48:47.058 --> 48:50.095
Richard Hammond,
155 miles an hour.

48:50.161 --> 48:53.231
I maxed the Range Rover
at 149.

48:53.298 --> 48:56.001
And James May, because
he's a blithering idiot,

48:56.001 --> 48:58.536
6,000rpm.

49:02.207 --> 49:05.076
The idiot's car
had also drained its tank,

49:05.143 --> 49:06.711
so while he was filling up,

49:06.777 --> 49:10.181
I set up another
of my clever demonstrations.

49:12.917 --> 49:14.685
Gentlemen, observe.

49:14.752 --> 49:17.255
You can buy very expensive
sunglasses.

49:17.322 --> 49:19.424
These ones
are made from real gold.

49:19.490 --> 49:21.592
Or you can buy
very cheap sunglasses.

49:21.659 --> 49:23.161
But what do we all do?

49:24.029 --> 49:25.663
We all have Ray-Bans.

49:27.865 --> 49:31.269
You do know you're just
being irritating, don't you?

49:31.336 --> 49:34.872
All you've actually told us
about your car is something
to do with underpants,

49:34.939 --> 49:36.274
iguanas and sunglasses.

49:36.341 --> 49:38.209
- I'm just saying.
- Well, don't!

49:40.611 --> 49:43.548
Back on the move,
we continued to follow James

49:43.614 --> 49:46.384
on our journey
to the NÃ¼rburgring.

49:46.451 --> 49:50.155
But after a while,
I started to worry.

49:52.057 --> 49:54.125
Where's he going?

49:54.192 --> 49:56.061
Why have we turned off
the motorway?

50:03.701 --> 50:06.204
- James...

50:06.271 --> 50:08.839
Well, I'm going to get
straight to the point.

50:08.906 --> 50:11.076
This is not the NÃ¼rburgring.

50:13.211 --> 50:14.612
It's Nuremberg.

50:19.550 --> 50:22.553
- Ah, well, yes, but--
- There's no "Ah, well"
about it.

50:22.620 --> 50:24.689
The thing is, I can't
actually speak German,

50:24.755 --> 50:27.725
only the bit about hands
being wet because
he's under a waterfall.

50:27.792 --> 50:31.729
But NÃ¼rburgring
is the same in English
as it is in German.

50:31.796 --> 50:34.165
I did it with voice control
in German with my car.

50:34.232 --> 50:37.034
It was set to German.
I said NÃ¼rburgring
and it went "blink"

50:37.102 --> 50:39.537
- and I said, "Yes."
But it's a similar name.
- Don't blame the car!

50:39.604 --> 50:41.639
Well, I didn't pronounce it
properly.

50:41.706 --> 50:44.409
That's like
muddling up our names
cos they both begin with J.

50:44.475 --> 50:47.011
Look, let's not get
all bogged down

50:47.078 --> 50:48.646
with who's been
a massive idiot

50:48.713 --> 50:51.682
and despite what he claims
can't do anything properly.

50:51.749 --> 50:55.253
- Nothing.
- Let's instead look for
a race track near here.

50:55.320 --> 50:57.188
Why don't we try
and find one?

51:01.058 --> 51:04.762
JEREMY: And that is exactly
what Hammond did.

51:14.639 --> 51:16.341
Where?

51:16.407 --> 51:18.143
Well, it's all around you.
Look, I've marked it out.

51:18.176 --> 51:20.711
Look, it goes around there
and up there and along there,

51:20.778 --> 51:23.548
and then down there
and round there.

51:23.614 --> 51:25.183
It's not really a track,
is it?

51:25.250 --> 51:26.751
No, it's better.
It's rallying.

51:26.817 --> 51:30.521
This will be the first ever
Nuremberg Rally.

51:30.588 --> 51:34.825
Well, not the...
absolute first ever.

51:34.892 --> 51:36.361
He's right.

51:36.427 --> 51:39.164
Do you imagine, if we did
motorcycling round here,

51:39.230 --> 51:42.167
it would be the first ever
Nuremberg Trials?

51:42.200 --> 51:43.601
Well, we could give it a go.

51:43.668 --> 51:45.436
Let's not run
before we can walk, eh?

51:47.205 --> 51:50.841
JAMES: Since Hammond's course
featured twisting bends,

51:50.908 --> 51:52.677
loose surfaces,

51:52.743 --> 51:56.847
sheer drops and piles of
enormous rocks everywhere,

51:56.914 --> 51:59.350
some practice laps
were in order.

52:02.653 --> 52:05.756
Slightly slow there
cos I go round a dusty one,

52:05.823 --> 52:08.226
and then this is...
I have no idea.

52:09.627 --> 52:13.198
"Danger." Right.
I'll take note of that.

52:14.665 --> 52:16.801
I don't want to fall off
there.

52:16.867 --> 52:19.270
Oh, shit. I really don't
want to fall off there.

52:20.538 --> 52:23.208
RICHARD: Now,
this bit is really scary.

52:23.241 --> 52:25.443
Yeah.

52:25.510 --> 52:27.845
That's a bit of
a trouser-changer.

52:27.912 --> 52:30.848
Ooh! Now, this
is quite interesting,

52:30.915 --> 52:32.883
cos in normal use,

52:32.950 --> 52:38.022
all of the power is sent to
the rear wheels in the Jag.

52:38.088 --> 52:39.757
But it can then send power,

52:39.824 --> 52:43.261
up to 50% of it,
to the front wheels.

52:43.328 --> 52:46.797
Right, this is where
I can go very wrong
if I'm not careful.

52:46.864 --> 52:47.832
Oh, shit.

52:54.705 --> 52:59.610
JAMES: Clarkson, meanwhile,
had decided he didn't need
to have a practice.

53:01.078 --> 53:02.880
What are you doing?

53:02.947 --> 53:05.750
It's my baked beans
demonstration for when
Hammond gets back.

53:05.816 --> 53:08.419
Because we've got cheap
supermarket beans,

53:08.486 --> 53:09.754
then expensive...

53:09.820 --> 53:12.323
Oh, God.
I haven't got time for this.

53:12.390 --> 53:15.260
And then, in the middle,
the Range Rover...

53:15.293 --> 53:16.461
Oh!

53:19.264 --> 53:21.098
JAMES: With practice over,

53:21.165 --> 53:24.769
Hammond lined up
on the beginning line
for his timed lap.

53:24.835 --> 53:29.106
Richard Hammond,
begin in three, two, one.

53:29.173 --> 53:30.341
Go!

53:32.877 --> 53:34.545
Here we go.

53:36.414 --> 53:37.982
Now, come on, Hammond.
Concentrate.

53:41.319 --> 53:45.756
Oh! That was beautiful
lift-off oversteer.

53:50.428 --> 53:52.297
A little bit of a brake,
and then...

53:55.700 --> 53:57.535
Ooh! That's too fast there.

53:59.136 --> 54:01.071
I just had a wee.

54:01.138 --> 54:05.643
Right, let's predict
what he's saying in there.

54:05.710 --> 54:10.014
He'll say the traction control
won't be turned off properly.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.983
Cos you can't turn
the traction control off
completely.

54:13.050 --> 54:16.354
He'll say, "I need power
and there isn't any!"

54:16.421 --> 54:18.589
Come on! Where's the power?

54:18.656 --> 54:20.458
Give me power! Give me power!

54:22.059 --> 54:24.028
Now, this one...
Oh, shit.

54:27.765 --> 54:29.700
This is the really fast bit.

54:32.136 --> 54:34.805
Come on, baby! Come on.
That's it. Give me power.

54:35.706 --> 54:38.509
Going in with big speed here.

54:38.576 --> 54:41.979
Now, brake early,
early, early, early, early,

54:42.046 --> 54:43.348
and then turn in.

54:47.217 --> 54:48.386
Bury it.

54:53.858 --> 54:55.926
I'm gonna be miles faster
than him.

54:55.993 --> 54:57.528
Well, you haven't even done
any practice.

54:57.595 --> 54:59.163
- I know.
- It's honestly not that simple.

54:59.229 --> 55:00.465
Yes, it is.

55:04.268 --> 55:05.503
Come on!

55:08.072 --> 55:10.375
Giving it all she can.
That's it, there you go.

55:10.441 --> 55:12.410
Little burst
and across the line.

55:15.580 --> 55:18.383
Five minutes 56 dead.

55:18.416 --> 55:20.084
- I don't know.

55:21.151 --> 55:22.653
- Five 56.
- Dead.

55:22.720 --> 55:26.391
Yes! Or no!
Did you see me
at that last bit?

55:26.424 --> 55:29.627
The traction control
just wouldn't let me put
the power down there at all.

55:29.694 --> 55:32.062
It stopped!
Did you see me stop there?

55:34.965 --> 55:37.101
- Why have you got
a stopwatch?
- To time him.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.836
No, no, no, no. Look.

55:38.903 --> 55:41.706
April 26th.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, OK.

55:41.772 --> 55:43.941
- April 26th at...
- No, a better idea.

55:44.008 --> 55:47.044
Why don't we just chalk marks
on the roof for every day?

55:47.111 --> 55:49.714
- Every time the sun comes up,
OK, another mark.
- Right.

55:50.615 --> 55:52.583
James May, you may begin

55:52.650 --> 55:55.319
in three, two, one.

55:55.420 --> 55:57.422
Now.

55:57.455 --> 56:02.159
And May is off
for Great Britain and Germany
in the Bentley!

56:02.226 --> 56:04.462
- He doesn't like heights.
- No, he doesn't like heights.

56:04.529 --> 56:06.797
- He doesn't like speed.
- Or slippery stuff.

56:06.864 --> 56:12.002
- So... everything he hates.

56:12.069 --> 56:14.639
JAMES: Despite
the hostile environment,

56:14.705 --> 56:16.073
I was determined to dig deep

56:16.140 --> 56:18.776
for the honour
of the Bentley badge.

56:22.046 --> 56:23.981
Slidey, slidey, slidey.

56:26.183 --> 56:27.452
Yes, Tarmac.

56:30.621 --> 56:32.657
Did you... Did you hear that?

56:32.723 --> 56:36.461
That was tyre squeal
from James May.

56:38.563 --> 56:40.498
Up the ridge.

56:42.099 --> 56:43.468
Knock it down a cog.

56:44.301 --> 56:45.503
Oh, my God.

56:46.804 --> 56:47.972
Blimey!

56:48.038 --> 56:50.775
That wasn't very
James May

56:50.841 --> 56:52.710
He'll have frightened himself
to death.

56:54.745 --> 56:55.980
That's the dippy bit.

56:57.281 --> 56:58.483
Look at this!

57:09.293 --> 57:10.761
Oh! He got air! He got air!

57:10.828 --> 57:12.196
I think he's being committed.

57:14.231 --> 57:16.667
Jeremy, what if he beats me?

57:16.734 --> 57:18.536
- Yeah.

57:18.603 --> 57:22.372
- You'll die of shame
and I'll die laughing.
- Yeah, OK.

57:22.507 --> 57:28.412
JEREMY: Try as he might,
though, the old lady was
losing time in the corners.

57:28.513 --> 57:32.850
The trouble is, it is
a two-and-a-half-tonne
fairly long car,

57:32.917 --> 57:35.720
and you can't change
the laws of physics.

57:37.622 --> 57:38.923
Cor! That's not good.

57:41.559 --> 57:44.094
Oh, get it straight! Come on!

57:46.263 --> 57:47.532
Oh, no! I overdid it.

57:54.939 --> 57:56.073
Six minutes 16.

57:56.140 --> 57:57.775
So he was 16...

57:57.842 --> 58:02.613
18 seconds slower than you
and his car is Â£212,000.

58:02.680 --> 58:04.815
Say some more of that stuff.
Write it down.

58:06.617 --> 58:09.887
JEREMY: Finally, it was the
turn of the best car here.

58:11.121 --> 58:13.390
Three, two, one.

58:13.457 --> 58:14.625
Begin!

58:16.927 --> 58:20.197
He hasn't... done
a single practice lap.

58:21.632 --> 58:23.668
I mean, not one.

58:23.734 --> 58:26.070
Traction control off.
That's better.

58:27.572 --> 58:29.574
And watch this!

58:31.308 --> 58:33.343
Flick it in. Nicely done.

58:33.410 --> 58:34.912
Flick it back the other way.

58:36.581 --> 58:39.416
While he's driving, what do
we think he's being

58:39.483 --> 58:41.485
Self Quiet?

58:41.586 --> 58:44.188
He probably isn't
saying anything.
He's probably concentrating.

58:44.254 --> 58:46.624
Yes!

58:47.792 --> 58:50.661
Oh, God,
I'm good at everything.

58:50.728 --> 58:52.997
However,
in order to win this contest,

58:53.063 --> 58:59.403
I had no intention of relying
only on my supreme skills.

58:59.469 --> 59:04.942
You see, the thing is,
the Jaguar and the Bentley
were designed as road cars

59:05.009 --> 59:08.378
and then given
some off-road ability.

59:08.445 --> 59:11.949
Whereas the Range Rover was
designed as an off-road car,

59:12.016 --> 59:15.620
and then given some ability
to work on the road.

59:15.686 --> 59:17.287
It's only
a subtle difference,

59:17.354 --> 59:21.626
but it means I don't have
to follow the beaten track.

59:22.627 --> 59:24.294
I can take shortcuts.

59:30.234 --> 59:33.270
It's such a clever car,
it really is.

59:35.973 --> 59:40.210
This car senses what sort
of terrain it's driving over,

59:40.277 --> 59:46.283
and then engages
or disengages the
differentials accordingly.

59:46.350 --> 59:50.120
You could not
come up here in the Bentley
or the Jaguar.

59:54.124 --> 59:55.860
- It's quiet. I can't hear it.

59:55.926 --> 59:58.495
A pair of pants?
Tin of beans

59:58.562 --> 1:00:00.297
There'll be another stupid...

1:00:00.364 --> 1:00:03.100
"You get ordinary ones
and mine's just the best."

1:00:06.136 --> 1:00:09.239
The Range Rover
can wade through water

1:00:09.306 --> 1:00:10.975
nearly a metre deep.

1:00:13.377 --> 1:00:14.779
And look at it!

1:00:14.845 --> 1:00:16.981
What a machine you are!

1:00:18.248 --> 1:00:20.250
Now we just pump
back up the hill.

1:00:21.485 --> 1:00:22.687
Power!

1:00:22.753 --> 1:00:24.689
Power now!

1:00:24.755 --> 1:00:26.724
- There he is.

1:00:26.791 --> 1:00:28.592
- No, hang on a minute.
- No, he's there, look.

1:00:28.659 --> 1:00:30.795
- No, but...

1:00:32.362 --> 1:00:34.098
And across the line.

1:00:36.033 --> 1:00:39.036
He's almost two minutes
quicker than you were.

1:00:39.904 --> 1:00:41.205
That's not possible.

1:00:46.610 --> 1:00:49.847
- That.
- A, your car's all wet,
which it shouldn't be.

1:00:49.914 --> 1:00:52.516
And you're almost two minutes
faster than Hammond.

1:00:52.582 --> 1:00:54.484
Yes, but, you see,
the thing is,

1:00:54.551 --> 1:00:57.121
you can buy a cheap car,
like a Jaguar,

1:00:57.187 --> 1:00:59.356
or you can buy
an expensive car,

1:00:59.423 --> 1:01:00.657
like a Bent--

1:01:04.895 --> 1:01:07.732
Cheat! Cheat!
He just cheated.

1:01:07.765 --> 1:01:09.499
A total waste of time,
that whole film.

1:01:09.566 --> 1:01:12.369
A total waste of time.
Range Rover,
two minutes faster.

1:01:12.436 --> 1:01:14.304
You cheated, simple as that.

1:01:14.371 --> 1:01:18.042
Anyway, look, if we can
just put the bickering aside
for one moment,

1:01:18.108 --> 1:01:19.643
I have to say,
that little Jag was,

1:01:19.744 --> 1:01:22.780
and it really was,
brilliant.
And it was designed

1:01:22.847 --> 1:01:26.050
by a local boy, Ian Callum,
born in Dumfries.

1:01:26.116 --> 1:01:29.653
He didn't just do that.
He also styled
the Aston Martin DB7,

1:01:29.754 --> 1:01:32.389
the DB9, the Vanquish,
the Ford Puma,

1:01:32.456 --> 1:01:34.191
the Escort Cosworth.

1:01:34.258 --> 1:01:36.060
- Yeah, he's British.
- Basically, yeah.

1:01:36.126 --> 1:01:37.494
- Well, pretty much.

1:01:37.561 --> 1:01:39.329
He is. He is.

1:01:39.396 --> 1:01:42.767
Anyway, sadly,
his new car isn't as good
as a Range Rover.

1:01:42.833 --> 1:01:44.601
Don't argue. It isn't.

1:01:44.668 --> 1:01:47.805
And on that terrible
disappointment for him,
it's time to end.

1:01:47.872 --> 1:01:49.139
Thank you so much
for watching.

1:01:49.206 --> 1:01:51.942
Thank you all so much
for coming.

1:01:52.009 --> 1:01:53.778
We'll see you next time.
Goodbye.
