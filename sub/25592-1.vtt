02:10.130 --> 02:12.466
Are we having a boy or a girl?

02:12.549 --> 02:14.509
- You sure you want to know?
- Yes.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.928
I can't take the suspense.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.185
- Is everything gonna be OK?
- Your baby boy is healthy.

02:27.522 --> 02:28.940
- Baby boy.
- Baby boy.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.784
You alright?

02:39.618 --> 02:40.452
Yeah.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.414
- We got months to get ready.
- Yeah. I'm not worried about that.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.625
Good. Then you shouldn't worry
about tonight either.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.294
Right. 'Cause asking Tom Sutherland
for his daughter's hand

02:49.378 --> 02:52.339
- is gonna be a walk in the park.
- Would you rather tell him I'm pregnant?

02:52.714 --> 02:54.675
- Funny.
- It's gonna be alright.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.260
Yeah. At least we'll have something
to talk about this time.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.804
Just go easy on Dad.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.641
Nothing to be afraid of.
Just don't bring up the boat.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.267
I try not to bring up the boat,

03:04.351 --> 03:06.812
but then I get nervous
and I end up bringing up the boat.

03:06.895 --> 03:10.649
- He restored it himself, Will.
- Yeah, I am aware of that little detail.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.994
I love you.

03:23.954 --> 03:24.913
I love you, too.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.332
- Good luck tonight.
- Thank you.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.376
- You're gonna need it.
- I know.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.462
- OK, I'll call you from the airport. Bye.
- Yeah.

03:51.314 --> 03:54.526
OK, I think it's gonna be easy enough
to get things going between us.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.570
- So, Tuesday? The same?
- Yeah.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.738
OK, see you.

04:16.548 --> 04:19.091
Hey, there. Mr. and Mrs. Sutherland.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.028
- Hi. Good to see you.
- Hi. Good to see you, too.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.489
Tom, honey? Will's here.

04:45.952 --> 04:46.912
Hi, Tom.

04:47.829 --> 04:48.747
Will.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.666
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.253
I was just about to fix myself
another drink.

04:56.213 --> 04:59.382
Why don't you see if Paula
can use a little hand in the kitchen?

05:03.428 --> 05:04.429
Yeah, sure.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.143
- Anything I can do to help?
- Oh, no. You're our guest.

05:10.894 --> 05:11.728
Relax.

05:12.604 --> 05:13.605
Go talk to Tom.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.106
Yeah.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.112
Here you go.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.572
Thank you.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.158
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.415
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Thank you.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.183
How we looking at time, hon?

05:50.976 --> 05:53.478
Not too long. Enjoy your scotch.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.734
Key West. Three years ago.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.737
I think it was five, actually.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.073
Sam has the same photo in our loft.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.409
Right.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.370
You came with us.
How could I forget that?

06:16.334 --> 06:18.169
That's... Wow!

06:18.712 --> 06:19.713
The boat.

06:21.840 --> 06:22.841
I remember this.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.136
Took me almost as long to make that one
as it did the original.

06:30.056 --> 06:33.310
Why don't you put her back down, Will?
Let's just stay on the safe side. Alright?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.227
Yeah, of course.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.858
Sam mentioned that the two of you
are thinking about

06:40.525 --> 06:42.611
- finding a house.
- We're talking about it, yeah.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.906
You know, at some point in the future
it'd be nice to have some more room.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.450
- Here you go.
- I am of two minds about it, you know?

06:50.327 --> 06:51.620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.415
- What are you of two minds about?
- Providing assistance.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.460
I need a guarantee
that if it doesn't work out,

06:59.336 --> 07:02.631
you can't make any claims to the money
that I put down. Nothing personal, Will.

07:03.298 --> 07:06.051
Sorry, I'm a little confused.
Did Sam ask you for help?

07:06.635 --> 07:10.138
No, don't worry about any of that, Will.
We've helped her brother, Steven, too.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.057
Right.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.769
You know that I'm making good money
on this job, right?

07:15.852 --> 07:18.813
If memory serves, you were unemployed
before you moved to Seattle. Sam had to

07:18.897 --> 07:21.608
- support both of you for a while there.
- No, Sam didn't have to...

07:25.570 --> 07:27.322
You know, like I said, work's good.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.323
And...

07:29.199 --> 07:31.201
you know, when it makes sense,
when...

07:31.576 --> 07:34.537
when it's the right time,
then I'll open my own practice. But...

07:35.789 --> 07:37.707
Well, in the meantime, we're fine.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.460
- That's great.
- Doesn't sound like much of a plan, Will.

07:42.128 --> 07:42.963
Tom.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.131
Give it a rest.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.385
Everyone wants the dream.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.180
Problem with your generation is
that nobody wants to work for it.

07:52.722 --> 07:56.267
I spent 27 years
serving our country.

07:57.352 --> 08:00.772
I saved and I saved
until I started working for Northbridge,

08:00.855 --> 08:03.525
where I started making
some real money. But...

08:03.608 --> 08:05.694
I always had a plan.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.656
You know, I have never asked anyone
for any help.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.783
And you're not asking for anything now.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.411
We're just offering to help our daughter.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.579
Why did you move to Seattle?

08:17.122 --> 08:18.540
OK, that's enough.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.667
Honey.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.086
I'm only asking because...

08:24.295 --> 08:26.131
I suspect that Will moved

08:26.673 --> 08:28.591
because he thought it would be easier.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.678
Because he thought it would be more secure

08:32.053 --> 08:34.139
if he moved my daughter away from me.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.058
- Moving was Sam's idea.
- Come on. It's...

08:38.601 --> 08:41.104
You know what, I doubt that.
Sam would have told me that.

08:41.855 --> 08:42.688
Oh, yeah?

08:44.190 --> 08:47.152
You think she would have told you
that she wanted to move away

08:47.235 --> 08:50.071
to start her life
on her own terms with me,

08:50.155 --> 08:52.657
without her father breathing down
her fucking neck all the time?

08:52.741 --> 08:56.077
Say what you've gotta say, spit it out.
Let us know how you really feel, Will.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.247
Sorry.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.625
Get it off your chest,
but just don't swear in front of my wife.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.672
Whose table do you think
you're sitting at?

09:11.760 --> 09:12.594
Will...

09:13.094 --> 09:15.930
Sweetheart, it's getting late.
Let me walk you out.

09:18.892 --> 09:19.851
Come on.

09:40.080 --> 09:40.914
Hey.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.167
<i>Am I your wake-up call?</i>

09:45.210 --> 09:46.669
No, no, I was just...

09:47.962 --> 09:49.798
I was just lying down after the gym.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.301
<i>Yeah, I don't think so.
You look like shit.</i>

09:55.428 --> 09:56.679
<i>What time is your flight?</i>

09:58.431 --> 09:59.974
Soon. What time is it?

10:01.810 --> 10:02.769
<i>Six in the morning.</i>

10:04.521 --> 10:06.773
<i>- In Seattle.</i>
- Fuck, fuck.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.275
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.152
<i>So, my mother just called.</i>

10:12.612 --> 10:14.823
Oh, that's... that's great.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.908
Wait, wait. What did she say?

10:17.659 --> 10:19.327
<i>What do you think she said?</i>

10:20.203 --> 10:24.874
Yeah, OK. I'm sorry, alright?
I'm sorry, but, Sam, look,

10:26.292 --> 10:29.045
he was into me from the second
I got in, OK? I guarantee you

10:29.129 --> 10:32.674
if I'd asked for his blessing last night,
he would have said no. So I didn't.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.468
<i>- My mother asked you to leave.</i>
- No, no, she didn't.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.013
It wasn't quite like that.
She didn't ask me to leave.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.390
<i>Just call her.</i>

10:40.557 --> 10:43.768
I'm really, really fucking late, OK?
I gotta go.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.271
<i>OK, fine. Just call me
when you get to the airport.</i>

10:48.481 --> 10:49.315
What was that?

10:50.984 --> 10:51.818
What was that?

10:52.694 --> 10:53.528
<i>Power's out.</i>

10:54.571 --> 10:55.780
What is that noise?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.575
<i>Will, something's wrong.</i>

10:58.658 --> 11:00.785
- Sam, what the hell is that?
<i>- I'm scared.</i>

11:00.869 --> 11:01.703
<i>Will...</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:03.663
Sam, can you hea...

11:04.998 --> 11:06.875
Jesus.

11:06.958 --> 11:07.792
Hello?

11:43.745 --> 11:46.873
Come on, Sam. Hi, it's me.
I'm at the airport. Give me a call.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.374
This way, sir.

11:56.257 --> 11:59.719
<i>Flight 23 to Seattle
is delayed until further notice.</i>

12:01.638 --> 12:04.182
What the fuck? Come on.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.774
<i>We have some breaking news
for you right now.</i>

12:12.857 --> 12:15.026
<i>We have unconfirmed reports this morning</i>

12:15.109 --> 12:18.279
<i>of a large seismic event
off the southern California coast.</i>

12:20.198 --> 12:22.742
<i>We currently don't have contact
with our Los Angeles bureau.</i>

12:22.825 --> 12:24.786
<i>We're now getting news of power outages</i>

12:24.869 --> 12:27.205
<i>across the western part
of the United States,</i>

12:27.288 --> 12:29.916
<i>and reports of telecommunication outages
as well.</i>

12:30.083 --> 12:32.877
<i>I want to stress this is all preliminary.</i>

12:32.961 --> 12:35.296
<i>We are reporting this
just as we are learning it.</i>

12:35.380 --> 12:39.175
<i>We do not yet have any information
on damages or casualties.</i>

12:39.634 --> 12:40.718
<i>The Southern California...</i>

13:12.250 --> 13:13.334
Hey, man, are you free?

13:19.507 --> 13:21.259
Two hundred bucks. Back to the city.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.266
Fuck.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.270
Shit. Fuck.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.697
Sam, it's me. Call me.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.200
Hey, it's me again. Call me
as soon as you get this, alright?

14:11.142 --> 14:12.935
- Will. Thanks, Mark.
- Thanks.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.899
Are you OK? Will's here.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.860
I guess that answers that question.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.946
We thought that there was a chance
that you flew back.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.076
They shut down O'Hare.
I didn't know where else to go.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.828
Well, have you talked to Sam?
I haven't been able to reach her.

14:31.162 --> 14:33.831
Yeah. I was on the phone to her
when it happened.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.625
I heard something, so did she.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.544
- What did you hear?
- I don't know. It was like a...

14:38.961 --> 14:42.465
Like a loud rumble or something.
I didn't know what it was. And then...

14:42.673 --> 14:43.841
we got disconnected.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.803
- What's the last thing she said?
- She said something's wrong.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.138
But she sounded scared.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.893
Alright, I'm gonna go pack up the rest
of my things. Yours are on the table.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.617
- I should head back to the airport.
- I thought you said they shut it down.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.662
Yeah, but once the power comes back on,
there'll be flights, right?

15:13.287 --> 15:14.956
Let's look at what we know, Will.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.917
There was an event,
a couple of hours ago, out west.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.796
The power shut off here,
two thousand miles away.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.967
We have no idea what's happening,
yet we've got F-22s doing flybys.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.929
This moment is not about waiting
for the power to come back on.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.850
The only thing that we can control
is what we decide to do.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.602
So, what? What are you saying?
What are you gonna do?

15:36.727 --> 15:37.603
Get on the road.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.565
What, you're gonna drive to Seattle?

15:42.316 --> 15:43.693
Paula can stay at Steven's.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.154
They'll be fine there.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.698
But my only daughter...

15:49.574 --> 15:50.408
she's alone.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.412
I only have one question for you.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.540
Are you coming with me?

16:11.762 --> 16:13.639
- Don't stop for anyone.
- Got it.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.476
Steven's prepared for everything.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.394
- OK.
- You'll be safe there.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.981
- I love you. Be safe.
- You'll be alright.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.566
You, too.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.860
- Bye.
- Let's go.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.656
How can cell service still be out?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.243
GPS is out, too.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.953
- You got money?
- Yeah.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.038
Fill her up with gas,
I'll go get supplies.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.043
- Hey, man you got cash?
- Yeah.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.005
- Cash only, right? Thanks.
- Thanks.

18:33.779 --> 18:34.780
Nice car, cutie.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.409
Wanna show me the back seat?

18:39.410 --> 18:40.620
Yeah, I don't think so.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.371
Excuse me?

18:44.540 --> 18:45.541
What'd you say?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.085
- What are you talking about?
- What's going on, Liza?

18:49.170 --> 18:51.922
- This piece of shit just called me a slut.
- What? Whoa, no, no.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.009
Hey, I didn't call you a slut.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.886
I think this is gonna
fucking cost you, man.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.096
- OK, OK.
- Hey! Don't do that.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.891
- That's my car.
- Shut the fuck up, old man!

19:04.602 --> 19:05.436
Hey, pops.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.689
- Come on, I know you got some cash.
- All right.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.318
The money's in my luggage.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.030
Don't look at Liza.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.283
What are you looking at?

19:20.117 --> 19:20.951
Whoa, whoa!

19:21.035 --> 19:23.621
- Jesus Christ, Tom.
- Get back in the car, Will.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.456
Start running and don't look back!

19:27.291 --> 19:28.334
Punk.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.449
Is there something you want to say?

20:03.828 --> 20:05.037
You should've told me.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.208
- Told you what?
- Told me that you had a gun.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.586
And what would you have said, Will?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.673
I'm assuming that you've never fired
a firearm before.

20:15.756 --> 20:20.052
No, I haven't used a firearm, but it's not
exactly a priority in my law firm, is it?

20:22.972 --> 20:25.391
You know what, Will,
what if they had taken this car?

20:27.309 --> 20:29.520
Game over. It would be game over!

20:47.496 --> 20:49.749
<i>Interstate 90 westbound is closed.</i>

20:52.418 --> 20:55.254
<i>Well, something must be going on
if they're not letting us through.</i>

20:56.297 --> 20:59.008
- Is there another way?
- No. We need this road.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.385
<i>Interstate 90 is closed.</i>

21:01.844 --> 21:02.970
<i>Stop, hold it there.</i>

21:03.763 --> 21:06.724
Sir, the road's closed ahead.
Follow the other cars. Thank you.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.185
I'm sorry, Sergeant. But we got
a lot of miles in front of us,

21:09.268 --> 21:11.562
and you're shutting down
the biggest highway in the country.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.898
Public safety issue, sir.
On account of the power outage.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.275
No help for you out there
if you have a flat or an accident.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.944
Let's get this traffic moving.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.697
- What are you doing?
- Can I just have a word, Sergeant?

21:23.365 --> 21:24.825
I understand you got a job to do.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.620
And I know you got orders.
I've been there.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.539
I spent the better part of my adult life
in the Marine Corps.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.500
Sir.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.668
We'd be on our own, I understand.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.129
But my daughter's a long ways
in that direction.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.799
I'm asking, can you help me?

21:44.720 --> 21:45.805
Yeah. Get in the car.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.812
Let the Caddy through!
Local traffic, lives past the next exit.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.856
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Good luck, sir.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.150
Well done.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.026
Apparently, we're not the only ones
heading west.

22:41.652 --> 22:44.989
The F-22s, the road block.
What is this?

22:45.614 --> 22:46.490
It's not good.

22:47.575 --> 22:48.450
Yeah.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.838
Jesus Christ.
I didn't even see him coming.

23:53.641 --> 23:54.850
I have no reception.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.645
He probably can't run our plates.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.650
I'm gonna check it out, OK?

24:03.108 --> 24:03.943
Careful.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.445
Officer?

24:10.115 --> 24:11.241
He's not a cop.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.953
<i>- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Get back in the car!</i>

24:14.453 --> 24:15.704
Will! Get back in the car!

24:15.788 --> 24:17.623
Tell your friend to get out
of the fucking car!

24:17.706 --> 24:20.668
- OK. Fuck.
- Tell him to get out of the fucking car!

24:27.132 --> 24:29.093
Will, let's go! Go, go, go!

24:33.973 --> 24:35.391
Who the fuck was that?

24:35.516 --> 24:37.977
Fuck. Get the ammo for the SIG
in the trunk!

24:38.310 --> 24:40.729
- What? It wasn't loaded before?
- I didn't need it to be.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.611
Will, just get the ammo out of the go bag.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.738
You see the black bag? Little black bag?

24:49.822 --> 24:52.324
- Yeah, I got it. He's coming!
- Take it out.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.284
Put the mag into the weapon.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.626
- How do I do it?
- Put the mag in the gun.

25:06.046 --> 25:09.049
Hit the button on the side.
Shoot. You gotta do it. Shoot.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.222
Shoot! Shoot, shoot!

25:15.305 --> 25:18.267
- Fuck, it's not working! What do I do?
- Pull it back! Put it in the chamber!

25:18.350 --> 25:20.811
Put the bullet in the chamber.
Pull the top back.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.397
- See if you have a cartridge inside.
- Fuck!

25:27.234 --> 25:28.318
Come on!

25:29.361 --> 25:30.529
Come on! Come on!

25:31.697 --> 25:32.573
Fuck you!

25:33.574 --> 25:35.617
Come on! Fuck!

25:36.326 --> 25:37.161
Hold on.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.625
Fuck.

25:47.671 --> 25:50.424
All right, OK. OK.

25:50.883 --> 25:51.884
Fuck.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.445
- Shit!
- Hold on!

26:43.769 --> 26:44.603
Tom.

26:56.490 --> 26:57.658
Ah, fuck.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.497
Get out of the car, faggot. Now.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.467
You OK?

27:30.899 --> 27:31.942
You all right?

27:33.902 --> 27:35.237
I think I broke my ribs.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.031
We're gonna need to find a garage.

28:55.484 --> 28:56.318
Hey.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.028
Do you work here?

29:00.447 --> 29:02.366
We were...
We've been in an accident.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.410
Yeah?

29:06.411 --> 29:07.496
Where' s the trooper?

29:08.205 --> 29:09.081
It was abandoned.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.214
- You guys even know where you are?
- No.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.928
- We were hoping for your help.
- You guys got money?

29:23.553 --> 29:25.847
- I ain't doing shit for free.
- Nor should you.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.017
I can take a look.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.812
If you need new parts, I can't help you.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.856
- Understood.
- Restroom's all the way in the back.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.040
Hey! I told you not to fuck with them!

29:53.292 --> 29:55.419
Who the fuck do you think you are?

29:56.211 --> 29:57.045
Leave me alone!

30:03.885 --> 30:05.387
<i>So, all cell service goes out.</i>

30:05.470 --> 30:09.683
<i>Virtually all communications, except local
ham radio like us or short wave.</i>

30:11.852 --> 30:14.938
<i>But how does that happen, huh?
US Government goes virtually silent?</i>

30:16.273 --> 30:19.693
<i>Are we talking World War Three?
Like a nuke attack that went sideways?</i>

30:19.776 --> 30:22.279
<i>I mean, the damned president's doing
a massive cover-up.</i>

30:23.655 --> 30:26.908
<i>Military coup? Martial law?
We don't know, we don't know.</i>

30:26.992 --> 30:30.203
<i>If anyone out there who knows anything,
get on short wave. Please, do it now.</i>

30:30.287 --> 30:31.997
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

30:32.080 --> 30:34.624
<i>- Is anyone out there?</i>
<i>- Two thousand satellites in space,</i>

30:34.708 --> 30:36.460
<i>- all of them down?</i>
<i>- Answer me, I...</i>

30:36.543 --> 30:38.962
<i>Government knows, man.
They're just keeping it from us.</i>

30:39.046 --> 30:40.589
<i>Is there anyone...</i>

30:42.299 --> 30:44.801
<i>I need help! Mayday!</i>

30:45.385 --> 30:48.388
<i>Mayday! Is anyone out there?</i>

31:34.101 --> 31:36.019
I sealed the radiator. It should hold.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.438
- You can keep driving for a while.
- A while?

31:39.689 --> 31:40.649
What if it breaks?

31:41.149 --> 31:44.361
Radiator isn't gonna break.
Might start leaking again, though.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.406
I can give you some of the sealant,
show you how to use it.

31:47.906 --> 31:48.907
OK.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.953
I'll gave you $200 for the labor.

31:53.036 --> 31:56.206
And if we get to where we're going,
I'll mail you another two.

31:56.665 --> 31:59.918
Yeah. How about you give me
that other two right now?

32:01.837 --> 32:02.712
Hey.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.091
Is that your Buick out there?

32:06.758 --> 32:07.592
Yeah.

32:08.468 --> 32:09.803
- Does it run?
- Why?

32:10.887 --> 32:11.805
Wanna sell it?

32:13.640 --> 32:17.727
No, I was gonna head out to California
and get the fuck out of this place.

32:18.854 --> 32:22.107
But now all she needs is a new
transmission, so she ain't for sale.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.359
Then maybe you should come with us.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.614
- I don't think so.
- We're going out west.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.201
Yeah? Why would I want to go with you?

32:36.204 --> 32:37.622
'Cause I'll give you $1,000.

32:39.124 --> 32:44.463
You can keep the cash
and be almost all the way to California.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.923
If you have any problems or a break down,
you can fix it.

32:47.841 --> 32:48.800
Look.

32:48.884 --> 32:52.804
No disrespect, but I ain't about
doing no road trip right now

32:52.888 --> 32:55.265
with two shady dudes
that appear out of nowhere.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.392
Whoa, whoa.
We're not shady, come on.

32:57.476 --> 33:02.189
You two roll up in a fucked-up,
shot up cop car that you say you found,

33:02.606 --> 33:04.524
towing a shot up Caddy, and...

33:04.816 --> 33:07.486
You know, you got blood
all over your face. So, yeah.

33:07.861 --> 33:08.945
Shady as fuck.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.781
I hear you loud and clear.
Doesn't look good.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.034
Doesn't look good.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.913
I could tell you that it wasn't us.

33:18.914 --> 33:19.748
That...

33:20.207 --> 33:22.918
we were you just defending ourselves.
I could tell you

33:23.418 --> 33:26.421
actually what happened,
down to the very last detail, but...

33:26.546 --> 33:29.299
if I were you,
I'm not sure I would believe that either.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.136
But I can tell you this.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.807
With a clear conscience,
I can look you in the eye and I can say...

33:41.186 --> 33:43.188
there's a lot to be afraid of out there.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.233
A lot of real danger.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.237
None of us know how much.

33:52.155 --> 33:52.989
But...

33:53.990 --> 33:54.908
me...

33:56.076 --> 33:56.910
him...

33:58.912 --> 33:59.746
we're not it.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.374
I'm Tom.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.167
This is Will.

34:07.337 --> 34:12.217
We're just driving out west
to see if we can find my daughter.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.434
All right.

34:22.476 --> 34:23.520
I've heard enough.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.398
So, you'll help us?

34:31.485 --> 34:32.320
Did I say that?

34:41.371 --> 34:42.455
I'm going to the car.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.377
I'll do it for two thousand.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.882
OK. Great.

35:03.727 --> 35:04.686
Got the essentials.

35:05.270 --> 35:08.064
As long as we don't snap an axle,
I can get us to Seattle.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.024
Great.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.402
Oh, and I siphoned the cop's gas.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.951
- What are you doing?
- I want us to be invisible from behind.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.123
- Here you go, Will. Drive the first shift.
- OK.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.460
You ride in the back.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.963
Course Tonto rides in the fucking back.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.469
Chill. Whoa, I was kidding.

35:42.015 --> 35:42.849
What's he doing?

35:43.892 --> 35:45.435
Better not fucking come back.

35:45.518 --> 35:46.686
Take it easy, man!

35:46.770 --> 35:47.854
Just drive.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.256
So, you guys got a radio signal?

36:16.174 --> 36:17.008
Not here.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.977
Is there a frontage road to the 90?
Another way west?

36:29.145 --> 36:32.732
Take a left here.
Can head out on the 14 West for a while.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.277
All right. OK.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.866
What kinda music you guys into?

36:41.950 --> 36:44.494
Yeah, I don't think
it's that kind of road trip, Ricki.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.056
There's someone behind us.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.142
Pull over.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.269
Lights off.

37:30.832 --> 37:31.666
Catch up.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.710
- Use their taillights to guide us.
- OK.

37:52.854 --> 37:53.897
Want some?

37:54.481 --> 37:55.607
No. No, thanks.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.028
Think he's asleep.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.156
Yeah, let him. He's gonna want to drive
when he wakes up.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.492
Then I'll get some sleep.

38:08.077 --> 38:10.622
So, his daughter... that's your girl?

38:12.499 --> 38:13.333
Yeah.

38:14.042 --> 38:14.876
Yeah, she is.

38:23.968 --> 38:24.803
Whoa.

38:26.012 --> 38:26.846
Check it out.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.142
It's crazy.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.480
- They on our side of the road?
- Jesus!

38:39.192 --> 38:40.193
Oh, my God!

38:47.242 --> 38:48.076
Fuck.

39:00.630 --> 39:01.464
Survivors?

39:02.590 --> 39:03.424
No.

39:08.638 --> 39:09.722
Fuck, Jesus Christ.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.017
She's dead.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.813
What's he saying?

39:17.981 --> 39:20.650
- I think it's a telephone number.
- Will, let him be.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.152
We can't just leave him!

39:23.820 --> 39:26.531
We're hours from a hospital,
and this guy, he's not gonna make it.

39:26.823 --> 39:29.701
Let's get back in the car.
Let's go, guys. Let's go. Let's go.

39:31.661 --> 39:32.495
Will?

39:33.204 --> 39:34.831
Let's go. Ricki!

39:38.960 --> 39:41.379
Leave them. Ricki, come on!

39:50.763 --> 39:53.558
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.397
What's he doing?

40:09.949 --> 40:10.783
Fuck!

40:11.159 --> 40:11.993
Let's go.

40:16.998 --> 40:20.585
You gotta stop the car for Ricki.
Stop the car, Tom. Stop the fucking car!

40:22.295 --> 40:23.838
Let's go! Come on!

40:24.422 --> 40:25.423
Go, go!

40:37.727 --> 40:40.229
If Will hadn't told me to wait,
I would've left you.

40:41.648 --> 40:42.565
Whatever.

40:43.066 --> 40:45.860
See if I fix your car
if it breaks down again.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.030
What the fuck?

40:49.113 --> 40:52.784
We had a deal. If you're not gonna
honor it, you need to speak up now.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.207
All right, then.

41:27.527 --> 41:28.486
You OK?

41:29.570 --> 41:30.405
Whatever.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.281
Yeah, he can be pretty hard.

41:34.659 --> 41:35.618
Think that's hard?

41:37.954 --> 41:39.622
You don't know what hard is, man.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.086
Yeah, maybe not.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.339
So, why California, huh?

41:49.590 --> 41:50.883
I'm gonna become a rapper.

41:52.010 --> 41:52.969
Come on, seriously?

41:53.803 --> 41:55.638
What? You don't think that I got it?

41:56.139 --> 41:57.140
No, no.

41:58.349 --> 42:02.520
No, of course I do. I just, you know,
I thought it was a pretty odd career path.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.480
Totally fucking with you.

42:07.608 --> 42:08.526
Nice.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.325
You ever seen clouds like that before?

42:20.913 --> 42:22.040
Hell, no.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.378
Something's coming.

42:30.256 --> 42:32.842
- Go, go! Get in the car!
- Get in!

42:50.026 --> 42:51.152
What the fuck is this?

43:03.206 --> 43:04.207
Holy shit.

43:14.425 --> 43:16.594
You see the bridge? Do you see it?

43:21.224 --> 43:22.600
What the fuck is going on?

43:37.115 --> 43:39.659
- Never seen a storm like this.
- This is crazy.

44:05.393 --> 44:06.686
Think that was lightning?

44:14.527 --> 44:16.112
- Turn it up.
- OK.

44:16.696 --> 44:19.740
<i>...as much information as we can,
for as long as we can.</i>

44:20.366 --> 44:22.869
<i>For as long as this generator will let us.</i>

44:23.828 --> 44:27.790
<i>Still no internet. No cell service.
No nothing.</i>

44:28.499 --> 44:29.917
At least not here.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.887
You're gonna want to stay on the 17.

44:41.429 --> 44:44.473
I have friends in Ashland Heights.
I already checked.

44:45.183 --> 44:46.934
We can stop there. We can resupply.

44:48.060 --> 44:50.479
We can resupply anywhere.
We don't wanna go out of our way.

44:50.563 --> 44:52.565
Look, why don't we just stop, OK?

44:52.899 --> 44:55.610
Ricki can check the car
and my friends can help us.

44:56.527 --> 44:59.280
- You just drive. I got the plans.
- I said they're friends, Tom.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.532
They're not just my friends,
they're Sam's friends.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.451
They're gonna wanna help us.

45:28.726 --> 45:29.560
Whoa, whoa.

45:30.686 --> 45:31.520
Hey.

45:32.897 --> 45:34.232
Something's wrong with the car.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.368
No services here. No gas, no nothing.

45:45.910 --> 45:49.497
We've been on the road for a long time.
A good friend of mine lives in the town.

45:51.165 --> 45:54.335
Every car that stops here says
they got friends in this little town.

45:56.128 --> 45:59.173
His name's Adam Dumont.
He was born and raised here.

45:59.799 --> 46:01.926
I was a groomsman at his wedding.

46:02.343 --> 46:05.972
My girlfriend and I have been here,
like, half a dozen times.

46:07.348 --> 46:09.141
His wife, Meg,

46:09.225 --> 46:13.771
she owns a pottery store in town.
I can't remember what the name of it is.

46:13.854 --> 46:16.983
We just wanna get off the road for
a couple of hours and then we'll be gone.

46:22.989 --> 46:24.407
- Harris!
- Yes, sir?

46:24.532 --> 46:26.617
Find an escort for these boys
over to the Dumonts'.

46:26.701 --> 46:30.288
And make sure, they get turned away,
they come straight back here.

46:30.371 --> 46:31.789
OK, let them through.

46:32.331 --> 46:33.874
- Good job.
- Let them through.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.167
Just let them through.

46:39.338 --> 46:42.425
<i>Is it North Korea? Is it the Chinese?</i>

46:43.092 --> 46:46.220
<i>Who else could do this?
Who else would do this?</i>

46:46.595 --> 46:49.307
<i>Damn it. Maybe they're in it together.</i>

46:50.474 --> 46:51.309
<i>We don't know.</i>

46:52.810 --> 46:54.437
<i>We do know they hate us.</i>

47:22.965 --> 47:23.799
Will?

47:26.719 --> 47:28.346
What are you doing here?

47:28.971 --> 47:30.723
How did you even get here?

47:31.724 --> 47:32.558
Hey.

47:34.685 --> 47:38.356
This is Tom, Sam's dad.
And Ricki in the back.

47:38.439 --> 47:41.359
Hey. We should all go inside.

47:41.442 --> 47:42.568
- It's a lot cooler.
- Yeah.

47:43.235 --> 47:47.114
I'm gonna take a couple of minutes
to check out the car and get organized.

47:47.990 --> 47:50.368
- Where's... Where's Sam?
- I'll explain inside.

47:52.620 --> 47:54.622
<i>The world is being prepared!</i>

47:54.747 --> 47:57.750
<i>The Bible says, "The earth knew not</i>

47:57.833 --> 48:00.628
<i>until the flood came and took them...</i>

48:02.046 --> 48:04.006
When was last time you heard from Adam?

48:05.174 --> 48:06.217
It must've been...

48:07.968 --> 48:10.596
I guess the night before it all, so...

48:14.183 --> 48:17.478
He's... He's on a business trip
to San Francisco.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.526
Well, if anyone's gonna be OK, it's Adam.

48:28.322 --> 48:31.075
I mean, none of this makes any sense.
It's just that...

48:32.785 --> 48:36.872
These fucking storms and then this heat.
And we've been having earthquakes.

48:40.584 --> 48:43.546
It's just... I mean, it's so crazy
that you're here and...

48:44.630 --> 48:46.841
- It's gonna be OK, Meg.
- Yeah.

48:49.510 --> 48:50.344
You know it...

48:52.304 --> 48:53.931
it can't stay like this forever.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.395
Really? Do you really think that?

49:04.108 --> 49:07.486
- Sorry. I haven't been sleeping and it...
- No, it's fine, It's OK.

49:10.364 --> 49:14.535
Do you want to take a shower?
We still have plenty of water.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.912
Yeah. That'd be good.

49:17.955 --> 49:18.789
All right.

49:47.067 --> 49:47.902
Hey.

49:48.611 --> 49:49.445
Hey.

49:53.866 --> 49:56.368
- Need help?
- Nah, I just got one more left.

49:57.203 --> 49:58.245
Thanks.

50:08.255 --> 50:09.965
How do we not know anything?

50:11.884 --> 50:17.056
Doesn't that tell you something, Will?
If they were all right, we would know.

50:22.186 --> 50:25.523
I just...
None of this is real. It can't be real.

50:26.732 --> 50:29.193
No one's telling me anything and...

50:29.276 --> 50:32.530
and no one even knows that I'm here.

50:32.613 --> 50:36.784
Adam knows you're here.
And he's coming back for you. I know that.

50:36.867 --> 50:37.993
And what if he isn't?

50:39.912 --> 50:40.746
Because...

50:41.789 --> 50:44.250
Because I can feel it, Will.

50:44.416 --> 50:47.002
I can feel that he's gone.

50:47.962 --> 50:51.090
- I can feel it in my bones. I know it.
- No, no, no. Just...

50:51.173 --> 50:54.176
And I know that Sam is gone, Will.
She's gone!

50:54.260 --> 50:56.262
It's OK. It's OK.

50:56.720 --> 50:57.555
It's OK.

50:58.639 --> 50:59.640
We're gonna be fine.

51:00.599 --> 51:02.977
We are gonna be fine. OK?

51:03.519 --> 51:05.104
Adam is coming back for you.

51:07.273 --> 51:08.107
I gotta go.

51:25.457 --> 51:26.375
Give me a hand?

51:28.460 --> 51:30.337
We need to load the supplies in the car.

52:07.291 --> 52:08.834
Look at that. That's military.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.215
- Was it shot down?
- I don't know.

52:16.175 --> 52:17.009
Jesus.

52:46.205 --> 52:48.248
Let's see if there's anything useful
down there.

53:10.479 --> 53:12.314
Oh, hell, yeah.

53:17.319 --> 53:18.153
Oh, yeah.

53:21.824 --> 53:23.283
Ricki, maybe you shouldn't...

53:26.495 --> 53:29.623
Holy shit! Holy fuck! It's hot in there!

53:30.499 --> 53:32.084
I thought it was gonna be cold.

53:32.918 --> 53:33.877
Fuck!

53:38.549 --> 53:40.843
- It's not funny.
- It kinda is a little bit funny.

53:41.510 --> 53:42.886
Fucking assholes.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.265
OK. We're gonna need to split up.

53:46.849 --> 53:47.683
OK, Ricki...

53:51.729 --> 53:53.272
Yeah. The Army base's.

53:53.564 --> 53:55.649
Minutemen, missile silos.

53:55.733 --> 53:56.817
It's a Blackhawk.

53:58.819 --> 53:59.987
You know about helicopters?

54:00.571 --> 54:02.823
Not really. Just the irony.

54:02.906 --> 54:06.076
Cheyenne, Chinook, Chickasaw, Apache.

54:07.536 --> 54:09.288
I just think it's funny that the Army

54:09.371 --> 54:12.458
named its helicopters after tribes
they tried to wipe out.

54:15.377 --> 54:16.211
Right.

54:16.837 --> 54:19.548
Look, Ricki. You're on gas detail.

54:19.882 --> 54:22.176
Want you to grab the cans,
check out the cars,

54:22.259 --> 54:25.387
look at the generators, whatever you find.
We're gonna go check out the diner.

54:46.825 --> 54:48.243
So, what are we looking for?

54:49.036 --> 54:50.746
Water, food.

54:51.705 --> 54:53.123
Be sure to get what we need.

55:00.047 --> 55:00.964
Cash is gone.

55:12.184 --> 55:14.394
- I said get gas!
- I already found some.

55:15.604 --> 55:18.816
Cars had their tires slashed,
but still had gas in the back.

55:22.069 --> 55:23.612
Whoa, whoa. I got it.

55:24.863 --> 55:26.490
I got it. You OK?

55:27.115 --> 55:27.950
Fine.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.042
- What's going on?
- He broke some ribs.

55:38.043 --> 55:39.545
Come on. Let's go.

56:10.701 --> 56:11.618
What's that?

56:14.329 --> 56:15.747
Wake up. Both of you, wake up.

56:16.456 --> 56:19.918
Check your phone. Ricki, check
your phone. Tom, check your phone now.

56:20.419 --> 56:21.670
I just heard something.

56:22.337 --> 56:24.256
I just heard.
We got cell reception, I think.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.049
- I don't got nothing.
- No?

56:33.640 --> 56:34.474
<i>Daddy?</i>

56:36.059 --> 56:39.271
<i>I love you. Can you hear me?</i>

56:40.355 --> 56:41.189
<i>Daddy?</i>

56:42.399 --> 56:44.401
<i>Whatever happens...</i>

56:45.611 --> 56:46.695
<i>tell Will...</i>

56:55.913 --> 56:57.331
The message is two days old.

56:58.874 --> 57:00.083
I'm gonna call Paula.

57:14.097 --> 57:15.223
Will?

57:20.228 --> 57:22.898
- Where the hell are they coming from?
- I don't know.

57:29.696 --> 57:30.948
Jesus Christ.

57:42.459 --> 57:45.963
- Jesus. We should turn around.
- This road's the only way over the pass.

57:47.339 --> 57:48.590
Oh, shit!

58:14.908 --> 58:18.745
- This is a mistake. Why are we stopping?
- I just want to see what's going on.

58:21.915 --> 58:24.334
- You OK, lady? What happened?
- I need help.

58:24.835 --> 58:26.378
I... I have a flat.

58:26.461 --> 58:29.047
OK, why don't you just come to us.
It's safer over here.

58:29.131 --> 58:31.008
- No, no.
- OK, OK.

58:31.091 --> 58:34.094
You just need to get in the car.
It's safer in the car. Come on, come on.

58:34.511 --> 58:37.347
- I just need help.
- Where's your spare? Is it in the car?

58:37.431 --> 58:39.057
I don't know. I don't know.

58:39.141 --> 58:41.226
- All right. Come on, Ricki.
- I can't.

58:41.810 --> 58:44.813
I can't. I don't know how.
I need help.

58:46.231 --> 58:47.524
Yeah. It's right here.

58:48.233 --> 58:49.276
Help me.

58:51.737 --> 58:53.155
- Should be right here.
- Right.

58:53.238 --> 58:54.114
Hey, hands up!

58:55.323 --> 58:56.533
Whoa, whoa!

58:57.075 --> 58:58.201
We just want the gas.

58:59.286 --> 59:01.163
- You happy? You happy now?
- Go get it.

59:01.246 --> 59:02.289
Shut the fuck up!

59:02.372 --> 59:04.291
- What the fuck is he doing?
- It's not personal.

59:04.499 --> 59:06.626
- We all got places to be.
- Stay calm.

59:06.710 --> 59:08.920
Stay calm, all right? Stay calm.

59:09.004 --> 59:10.672
- Hurry up, now.
- It's locked.

59:10.756 --> 59:12.674
- Open it.
- It's locked and I don't have the key.

59:13.341 --> 59:15.844
- You got anything?
- Bingo!

59:17.054 --> 59:18.096
- No!
- Hey!

59:27.355 --> 59:29.191
Don't. Don't fucking do it, man.

59:30.275 --> 59:31.902
Fill it. Fill it!

59:32.736 --> 59:35.655
- Just leave us one canister, please.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

59:36.156 --> 59:38.033
- Jesus Christ!
- Tom, you all right?

59:39.743 --> 59:41.119
Tom! You OK?

59:41.203 --> 59:43.371
Get the gas.
Let's get the hell out of here.

59:43.705 --> 59:46.041
Just get the gas. Let's fucking go, man.

59:46.124 --> 59:48.126
- Leave us one can, man. Please.
- Hurry!

59:49.294 --> 59:50.545
Don't leave us here to die.

59:50.629 --> 59:52.923
- Let's fucking go.
- You're killing us. Don't take the gas!

59:54.049 --> 59:55.967
Jesus Christ. You OK?

59:56.593 --> 59:59.429
- My ribs. Couldn't lift my gun.
- Fuck!

59:59.513 --> 01:00:01.223
- Fuck!
- Shame on you.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.308
- All of you.
- You fucking helped them!

01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:07.104
- All right. Come on, get in the car.
- Why'd you stop?

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:10.315
- We're supposed to be decent.
- Get in the car. We have to go right now!

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:14.861
I'm staying with him. I'm not leaving
my husband like this. Not with you people!

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.280
We gotta go. If we don't catch them,
we're dead. Come on, go.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.370
- Come on, get in the car!
- Let's go, Will. Can't lose them.

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:35.882
They can't be far.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.561
Come on! Come on, damn it.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:06.329
Fuck!

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:08.123
Hold on!

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.001
Holy fuck.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:18.675
Hold on!

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:22.554
Come on!

01:01:25.891 --> 01:01:28.059
- Will...
- Holy fuck!

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.105
- You know how to use this?
- Yeah.

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:33.190
Take it.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:37.319
Make it count!

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:40.488
Shoot!

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.825
Hold on! Here we go.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:45.702
Shoot!

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:47.454
Shoot, Ricki!

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:48.663
Shoot!

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:49.915
Shoot!

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:51.583
Do it!

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.543
Shoot the tire! Shoot.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:55.587
You got it.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:58.381
You go it. Shoot the tire, Ricki!

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:17.609
Get the gas!

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:20.695
I'll get them.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:25.450
- Get it!
- No.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.494
I can't!

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:30.747
Get off!

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.877
- I can't open it!
- Let go of me!

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:38.588
- Come on, Ricki. Come on. Damn it!
- I can't! He's holding it.

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:40.131
- Come on!
- Let go!

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:41.925
We're running out of time.
Go, go. Come on!

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.220
Come on. Let's go.

01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:46.429
Let's go. Come on!

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:47.973
Go, go, go.

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:31.766
Pull over.

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:35.895
- I can't pull over here, Ricki.
- I said pull over.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.856
- I said pull over!
- OK, OK.

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:51.328
Fuck!

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.122
I fucking killed them!

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:56.124
They robbed us, Ricki.
They were gonna kill us.

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:58.376
You saved us. That's the truth.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.463
- You did a good thing.
- Yeah? For what?

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.215
So I can do this all over again?

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:07.302
It's another fucking
thousand miles to Seattle.

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:10.388
- It's OK. It's OK.
- I'm not gonna shoot you!

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:14.559
I shouldn't have fucking come.

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:18.897
I'd rather go back to the fucking rez
than spend another minute here with you.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.774
We're in the middle of fucking nowhere.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:22.942
You think that I wouldn't make it?

01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:27.864
Who do you think's been taking care of me
since the day that I was born?

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.706
We'll survive this longer than you.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:39.501
Fuck!

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:43.213
- Fuck both you guys.
- Ricki, OK, let's just take a...

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:46.257
We're gonna take a second, all right?
And we're gonna rest here.

01:04:58.186 --> 01:04:59.020
Ricki?

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:01.815
You saved us. Remember that.

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:03.858
I am...

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.249
Let's just give her a minute.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.204
Ricki?

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:13.595
Ricki!

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.191
Tom.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:27.567
Wake up.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:30.904
Ricki's gone. She left.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:33.615
What?

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.033
She took her stuff.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.368
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.037
Maybe she'll be safer.

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.877
Should never have asked her
to come with us.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.669
- Up ahead.
- Yeah.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:28.962
There.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:30.838
Goddamn.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:36.302
Jesus.

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:41.766
Let's just check for gas.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:58.051
- What's going on, Tom?
- I can't breathe.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:01.679
- All right. Let's get some help right now.
- No time. My lungs are collapsing.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:04.349
- Gotta let the pressure out.
- OK. How, how would...

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.060
- What you want me to do?
- Put it in.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:08.728
- Where?
- Put it...

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.438
- Put in it.
- OK, OK.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.564
- OK.
- All the way in.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:23.451
OK.

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:25.243
OK.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:11.791
Sam told me that...

01:10:13.584 --> 01:10:17.088
your father left you.
That's ugly.

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:20.758
And you were just a kid, right?

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:24.429
Yeah.

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:26.431
Yeah.

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:28.725
And your old man...

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:33.312
he's... he's all right, right?

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:38.943
I guess. He lives in Idaho now
with his new family. I see him...

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.529
once every couple years.

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:46.492
It's a shame that you never
got to meet my father.

01:10:50.705 --> 01:10:53.082
Sam must have told you
some stories about him.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:54.834
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.794
You know,

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.005
if you think I'm bad,

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:00.965
then...

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:03.176
forget it.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.473
He had this... had this look,

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:10.767
when he thought you crossed the line.

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:14.729
He'd just stare at you.

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:19.859
It wasn't in disappointment, you know?

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.612
No. It was...

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:27.950
'cause he was disgusted at the fact
that he brought you into the world.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.168
He was a shitty father.

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:43.007
I mean, in his heart, he was a good man.

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.182
I don't know if I'm a good father.

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:54.101
I try.

01:11:58.272 --> 01:11:59.774
You know I love your daughter.

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:02.693
Yeah.

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:06.197
I know.

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:09.534
I know you do, yeah.

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:13.579
If I didn't think that,
I would have killed you a long time ago.

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:22.713
You'll be on your own soon.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:26.509
Yeah.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:31.055
I need to ask your word on something.

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:34.350
Yeah, of course, anything.
Whatever you want.

01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:37.144
I need you to promise

01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:41.274
that you'll always keep her safe.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:44.694
Tom...

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:48.614
of course I will. I promise you.

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:51.284
I promise you.

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:03.629
You know...

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:07.842
there's something I need to tell you.

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:09.343
Nah.

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:10.845
I know.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:14.640
No, no. You don't know this, Tom.
No, you don't know.

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:19.270
Sam's pregnant.

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:21.439
I know.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:23.774
What?

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.860
What do you mean you know?
How'd you know?

01:13:25.943 --> 01:13:28.988
Paula, she called her after our dinner,

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:31.324
and Sam told her everything.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:34.327
Said that you're having a baby boy!

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.002
- So, all this time you...
- Yeah.

01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:45.212
All this...

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:48.132
You fuck.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:53.721
You know, I...

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:57.016
I got to tell you something else, too.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.062
I got to tell you about the boat.

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:04.774
Seriously? You know, why don't you quit
while you're ahead on this.

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.113
You know all that shit you gave me,

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:13.324
over the last six years?

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:16.452
The really funny thing is you...

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:21.332
you think it was me that was driving
that boat when it crashed into the rock.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:24.543
- Get out! It was Sam?
- Yeah. Hell, yeah.

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:29.423
She was drunk. I mean,

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:33.010
drunk as anything. I mean,
we both were and...

01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:36.055
you know, when we came down
in the morning,

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:40.351
and we see the boat, it had sunk to
the bottom of the fucking lake, I mean...

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:43.980
I don't know, I just...

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:47.108
I thought it was the right thing to do,
you know

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:50.069
Say it was me.

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:53.531
Sam still doesn't know.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:57.243
You're a good man.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.288
You're gonna be a good father.

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:05.459
Yeah.

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:28.190
She's gonna be fine, Tom.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:31.444
She's gonna be fine.

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:44.206
Maybe we can get some help here.

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:08.814
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:19.492
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:34.757
Fuck.

01:16:41.222 --> 01:16:42.431
- Take it slow.
- Yeah.

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:50.106
We need to get past.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:52.858
My friend is sick. He needs a doctor.

01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:01.242
We have money.

01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:03.744
Bring the car here.

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:05.287
We'll get you help.

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:09.333
All right, we're coming.
Just don't shoot.

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:15.214
What are you doing?

01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:19.009
- Wait, we can't go over there.
- Yeah, no shit, Tom.

01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:38.529
Ah, fuck.

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:51.750
Grab the gun, Will.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:17:58.883
Good job.

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.010
Fuck!

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:15.900
Good. You did good.

01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:19.570
They're coming from both ways.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:22.198
Turn around!

01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:40.883
Give me the gun, Will.

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:47.556
When I say three,
I want you to swerve to your left.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.731
One... two... three!

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.372
Oh, shit, Tom.

01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:22.508
Tom.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:25.344
Tom?

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.511
No, no, no. Fuck!

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:50.929
Come on!

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:54.266
Come on! No!

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:08.655
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:11.575
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, you fucking...

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:12.659
Fuck!

01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:15.245
Fuck! Fuck.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:16.705
Fuck.

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:18.082
Fuck.

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:31.136
I'm sorry, Tom.

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:24.833
Hey, hey!

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:44.853
Where you going?

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.814
I'm going west, trying to get to Seattle.

01:23:49.107 --> 01:23:50.025
We're going north.

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:56.615
We've been staying off the interstate.
It's not safe.

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:57.699
Yeah, I know.

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:04.957
All right, we'll take you
as far as we can.

01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:06.667
- OK.
- I'm gonna need that.

01:24:09.127 --> 01:24:10.337
I got family in the car.

01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:18.011
OK.

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:19.388
OK.

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:21.557
Easy.

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:26.520
All right.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.093
<i>This message is being broadcast...</i>

01:25:02.973 --> 01:25:04.850
This message is being broadcast...

01:25:10.147 --> 01:25:10.981
Nothing.

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:15.527
Do you have any idea what happened?

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:17.321
We still don't know.

01:25:17.904 --> 01:25:20.324
Started in Los Angeles.
Or at least...

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.035
what it was.

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:27.331
They're saying go to Canada.
Something about the air.

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:32.419
- It's been three days now?
- No. Today's day five.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.591
I'm guessing you haven't slept.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.010
Yeah, you and me both.

01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:50.979
You should take this exit.

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:21.343
Hello!

01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:26.973
Come on.

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:33.772
Hello?

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:35.524
Dad?

01:26:45.575 --> 01:26:46.618
You sure this is OK?

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:50.455
Yeah, yeah. It's my father's place.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.793
There's bedrooms upstairs
if you want to rest.

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:57.963
And hopefully there's some food
in the kitchen, take a look.

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:01.925
All right, thank you.

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:03.677
Yeah.

01:27:46.553 --> 01:27:47.679
Well, they're asleep.

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:50.599
Look, I just want to say

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:52.809
we really appreciate this.

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.941
There's about three weeks of food here.

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:04.613
Generator last will you five days,
maybe more if you're conservative.

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:08.909
There's one car in the garage,
but I had to siphon off most of the gas.

01:28:08.992 --> 01:28:11.703
But if you look around,
you're gonna find enough to get north.

01:28:12.829 --> 01:28:14.331
But I need to leave right now.

01:28:15.415 --> 01:28:16.917
And I need a four-wheel drive.

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:20.295
Which means I need to take your Jeep.

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:23.340
That's the deal that I'm offering.

01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:30.847
Sure. Yeah.

01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:41.858
Shit.

01:32:59.657 --> 01:33:00.492
You're alive.

01:33:38.655 --> 01:33:39.489
Hello?

01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:43.368
- This is private property!
- Will!

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.495
- Will. Oh, my God!
- Sam!

01:33:45.912 --> 01:33:46.746
Will

01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:49.415
He's our neighbor, Will.
Put your guns down!

01:33:52.585 --> 01:33:53.503
Will.

01:33:54.379 --> 01:33:55.213
You're OK.

01:33:55.713 --> 01:33:56.840
- You're OK.
- I'm OK.

01:33:58.007 --> 01:33:59.717
We're OK, Will.

01:34:00.844 --> 01:34:01.678
You're alive.

01:34:02.512 --> 01:34:03.388
You're alive.

01:34:03.847 --> 01:34:05.598
- I can't believe it.
- The baby's OK.

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:09.227
Oh, God. You're alive.

01:34:19.529 --> 01:34:22.448
- Come here. Please, come here.
- I'm here.

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:24.075
Come here.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.251
You know, I wouldn't have made it
without him.

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:34.711
I wouldn't be alive.

01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:39.591
And I did everything I could.
I did everything.

01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:40.800
I know, baby.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:43.553
I know you did.

01:34:49.058 --> 01:34:50.685
I'm never gonna leave you again.

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:08.369
I love you.

01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:02.340
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:36:03.216 --> 01:36:04.425
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:05.969
Hi.

01:36:11.307 --> 01:36:13.893
You know, when I saw Seattle,
I didn't think that...

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:17.522
Just thank you.

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:20.817
What are neighbors for?

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:26.281
You... You want one?

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.824
Yeah, sure.

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:37.125
Thank you.

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:41.045
It all happened so fast.

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:42.797
Yeah, it was maybe...

01:36:43.798 --> 01:36:45.008
ten, fifteen minutes

01:36:45.091 --> 01:36:48.261
before the police were just yelling
at everybody to evacuate.

01:36:48.886 --> 01:36:50.471
I mean, you could see the Sound

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.182
and the water retreat. I've never seen
anything like that before.

01:36:53.683 --> 01:36:56.102
We were a couple miles inland
by the time the waves hit.

01:36:57.145 --> 01:36:58.062
You could hear it.

01:36:58.396 --> 01:36:59.605
- It was horrible.
- Yeah.

01:36:59.897 --> 01:37:01.357
And just so you know, Will...

01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:05.111
I don't think this was an earthquake.

01:37:06.279 --> 01:37:07.530
I'm a software engineer.

01:37:08.114 --> 01:37:10.533
I've seen tons of war games simulations,

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:13.286
including this exact scenario.

01:37:14.454 --> 01:37:15.747
Events just like this.

01:37:16.456 --> 01:37:17.373
They're designed

01:37:18.291 --> 01:37:21.753
to erase rational behavior with what
appears to be a singular incident.

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:24.172
But really...

01:37:25.048 --> 01:37:26.174
it's all synchronized.

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.009
What the fuck you talking about?

01:37:28.885 --> 01:37:29.719
Will...

01:37:30.636 --> 01:37:33.264
- Look, I'm not trying to upset you.
- You're not upsetting me.

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:34.974
Good.

01:37:36.934 --> 01:37:39.437
I know the last couple days
have been rough on you.

01:37:47.945 --> 01:37:50.698
I mean, come on, you don't really believe
this bullshit, do you?

01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:52.200
This is not...

01:37:52.658 --> 01:37:56.621
I just drove across the fucking country.
You can't create things that I've seen.

01:37:57.663 --> 01:38:00.208
- Seriously, are you fucking with me?
- No, I'm not fucking with you.

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:03.753
Think about it in laymen's terms.
A nuclear bomb goes off the coast.

01:38:04.087 --> 01:38:08.466
Then a virus takes down the grid before
anyone can figure out what happened.

01:38:11.803 --> 01:38:14.514
- I've seen the intel.
- You haven't seen it. There is no intel.

01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:17.809
- That is fucking bullshit.
- The bomb plays like an earthquake.

01:38:17.892 --> 01:38:19.811
That's what causes the waves.

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:21.604
Yeah?

01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:24.273
But the power going out,
that created the chaos.

01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:27.360
Don't you think it's strange that...

01:38:28.486 --> 01:38:30.238
the power just went out everywhere?

01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:35.159
The communications? I mean,
just fucking think about it, man.

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:40.832
Unless, I don't know, I don't know.
Maybe he believes in coincidences.

01:38:44.001 --> 01:38:44.836
Baby?

01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:47.422
Baby, come on.

01:38:49.173 --> 01:38:50.007
You need sleep.

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:52.093
I'm gonna clean up here. all right?

01:38:52.176 --> 01:38:54.679
And we can talk about all this
in the morning, all right?

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:57.390
When you've had a good rest
and you're feeling better, OK?

01:38:57.974 --> 01:38:58.808
Come on.

01:39:00.935 --> 01:39:04.147
You know, there was an ash cloud
over the ocean.

01:39:05.148 --> 01:39:06.399
Seattle is gone,

01:39:07.316 --> 01:39:08.943
God knows how many other cities.

01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:12.280
I don't know what the fuck is going on,

01:39:12.530 --> 01:39:15.324
and you do not know what the fuck
is going on either.

01:39:15.408 --> 01:39:17.076
So, let's not pretend that you do, OK?

01:39:19.871 --> 01:39:20.705
OK.

01:39:27.086 --> 01:39:28.546
They happen all the time now.

01:39:31.549 --> 01:39:32.383
Yeah.

01:39:34.302 --> 01:39:36.429
Well, in the end,
it doesn't really matter, I guess.

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.014
Why?

01:39:39.432 --> 01:39:40.558
We all have to live, right?

01:39:41.726 --> 01:39:42.560
No matter what.

01:39:43.686 --> 01:39:44.645
I'll drink to that.

01:39:47.857 --> 01:39:49.400
Come on. Let's go.

01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:50.902
Hey, can I...

01:39:51.569 --> 01:39:52.987
Can I see that SIG of yours?

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.034
Sure.

01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:11.964
It's nice.

01:40:15.301 --> 01:40:17.011
Be nicer with bullets, though, right?

01:40:18.888 --> 01:40:19.805
Good night.

01:40:23.309 --> 01:40:24.519
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:40:32.902 --> 01:40:34.737
I know he helped you,
but he just...

01:40:35.988 --> 01:40:39.075
Tell me you don't believe
that bullshit that he's telling you?

01:40:39.242 --> 01:40:40.117
I don't.

01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:48.417
You and the baby...

01:40:49.835 --> 01:40:51.546
are the only thing that matters.

01:40:54.674 --> 01:40:55.591
The only thing.

01:42:13.461 --> 01:42:14.962
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:18.758
You seeing this?

01:42:19.925 --> 01:42:21.427
Still think it's a simulation?

01:42:24.096 --> 01:42:25.014
No.

01:42:27.642 --> 01:42:28.976
I owe you an apo...

01:42:31.228 --> 01:42:32.688
I let the whiskey do the talking.

01:42:34.106 --> 01:42:38.361
I guess I just convinced myself that
that would put me more in control, but...

01:42:40.029 --> 01:42:41.656
It doesn't make me crazy, right?

01:42:44.492 --> 01:42:46.369
Why were you looking in my car
this morning?

01:42:49.914 --> 01:42:52.667
I wasn't trying to steal your car, Will,
if that's what you're after.

01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:55.461
You planning on leaving?

01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:57.630
By myself, no.

01:43:01.217 --> 01:43:02.718
But we've got supplies here.

01:43:09.392 --> 01:43:12.853
I saw two kids. I thought that maybe
they took something from your car.

01:43:13.562 --> 01:43:14.814
Saw two kids. Right.

01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:20.695
Where are these kids right now?

01:43:22.238 --> 01:43:23.364
They're in the woods.

01:43:25.491 --> 01:43:27.993
I've been running a perimeter
every morning since we got here.

01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:32.331
Come with me, I'll show you.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.102
Must be a volcano around here.

01:43:53.686 --> 01:43:54.770
Don't worry about it.

01:44:15.541 --> 01:44:16.375
We're leaving.

01:44:17.418 --> 01:44:19.378
Unless you want to stay,
you should come with us.

01:44:21.547 --> 01:44:22.590
It's not safe here.

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:24.925
Where are you going?

01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:26.427
North.

01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:36.270
She wants to stay, Will.

01:44:41.567 --> 01:44:43.152
I don't see any kids out here.

01:44:48.824 --> 01:44:50.367
I'm not the boogie man, Will.

01:44:51.911 --> 01:44:53.287
Remember, I saved her life.

01:44:54.663 --> 01:44:57.291
We have a bond. That means I get a voice.

01:44:59.794 --> 01:45:00.878
We thought you were dead.

01:45:01.796 --> 01:45:03.964
Well, I'm not, am I?
I'm here.

01:45:06.926 --> 01:45:08.385
You know she's pregnant, right?

01:45:15.392 --> 01:45:16.727
You don't have to do this.

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.235
I do.

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:53.013
Sam!

01:45:54.557 --> 01:45:55.391
Sam!

01:45:56.433 --> 01:45:58.352
- What's happening?
- Something's coming.

01:45:58.435 --> 01:46:00.020
- We have to go right now.
- What?

01:46:00.104 --> 01:46:01.480
Go... Go where?

01:46:01.772 --> 01:46:05.484
- OK. OK. Where's Jeremiah?
- He tried to kill me. Come on.

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:07.027
- We've got to go.
- What?

01:46:08.988 --> 01:46:09.822
OK.

01:46:10.239 --> 01:46:11.073
OK.

01:46:23.043 --> 01:46:25.212
- What is it?
- It's happening again.

01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:33.512
Oh, God!

01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:39.351
It's getting closer.

01:46:41.186 --> 01:46:44.189
We're gonna make it. No matter
what happens, we're gonna make it, OK?

01:46:51.155 --> 01:46:52.698
Look at me, OK? Look at me.

01:46:53.324 --> 01:46:55.284
- It's gonna be OK.
- I know.

01:46:57.286 --> 01:46:58.370
- I love you.
- I love you.
