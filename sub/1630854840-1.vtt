00:15.265 --> 00:16.558
How was your journey?

00:20.228 --> 00:21.438
It was terrible.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.858
I got the bus because I'm poor.
And it smelt like warm, raw chicken.

00:24.941 --> 00:25.942
And I'm really nervous,

00:26.026 --> 00:28.403
so I thought I was gonna shit myself
the whole way in, but I didn't.

00:28.486 --> 00:31.364
And if I'm sitting weirdly,
it's because I think my tampon's come out.

00:31.448 --> 00:34.159
I didn't have time to go to the bathroom
downstairs 'cause I slept in.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.995
Because I spent so long last night
trying to make myself come,

00:37.078 --> 00:38.747
but I couldn't
'cause of my antidepressants.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.043
I don't know why I just told you that.

00:43.877 --> 00:44.878
It's my thing.

00:46.463 --> 00:47.505
Don't worry.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.675
If you're the right candidate,
the truth can only work in your favour.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.636
Oh, I hate that.
Yeah, that's awful for me.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.223
So it's a cliché, I know,
but why do you want to work here?

00:57.307 --> 00:59.225
I don't, but I need money to live.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.311
You've got a two-one
in English literature.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.898
No, I dropped out. But I'm--
I was too embarrassed to tell anyone.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.525
So I pretended to go every day for a year.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.819
But, really, I just wandered around
the big Primark in town.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.404
What would you say
your greatest weakness is?

01:11.488 --> 01:14.199
Crippling insecurity.
I'm selfish, kinda lazy. I lack ambition.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.992
I'm stubborn, argumentative, jealous.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.827
I only wash my hands
if there's someone else in the bathroom.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.580
Don't think I'm capable of love.
I am worried I'm a little bit racist.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.210
I'm a bit afraid to ask this,
but do you have any questions for me?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.173
Do you have a gross eye hole under there?

01:34.135 --> 01:35.136
I'm so sorry.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.640
I see you haven't got your power down
on here.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.353
That's because I don't have one yet.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.609
We interview a lot of candidates.
What makes you special?

01:58.910 --> 02:00.161
I don't know.

02:03.748 --> 02:04.999
Yeah. How's Rachel?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.709
<i>I'm fetching her right now.</i>

02:06.793 --> 02:07.836
-Oh, yeah?
-<i>How are you?</i>

02:07.919 --> 02:09.420
Yeah, good. I'm great.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.384
Nice one, mate.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.442
It's my sister's 18th on Saturday
if you wanna come.

03:13.401 --> 03:16.446
It's probably gonna be shit-ish,
but, you know, free cake.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.907
And my mum always buys
too much wine.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.825
You've got a sister?

03:20.909 --> 03:25.622
Yeah, Andy.
I've mentioned her, I think. A few times.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.081
That's mad.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.629
<i>If you're busy, it's totally fine.</i>
<i>No worries at all.</i>

03:32.712 --> 03:34.547
Option's there. You're more than welcome.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.216
It'd be cool if you came, I suppose.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.438
Every time.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.916
Twenty-five years I wasted with that man.
She's been with him 25 minutes.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.877
And they were the best 25 minutes
of his life, you dumb bitch.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.838
Look, we can settle this today.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.840
If we can talk to Mr Greenham directly,

04:17.924 --> 04:19.592
then I'm certain
he'll side with our client.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.802
Ms Jackson.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.350
Hi. Hello.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.519
I'm so sorry for your loss.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.107
Yes. Sorry.

04:50.415 --> 04:54.460
Oh, fuck off.
Can I not get a moment of peace?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.671
-Mr Greenham--
-I remember you from the divorce.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.841
Grown a moustache, have you? Didn't think
you could look more like a nonce.

04:59.924 --> 05:03.303
I made it very clear in my will.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.139
Tanya gets everything.

05:07.348 --> 05:11.060
The Knightsbridge scarecrow gets nothing.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.897
And one more thing, go fuck yourselves.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.411
Once again, my deepest condolences.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.669
-Who are you?

05:49.140 --> 05:50.224
-Free cat?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.920
Oh, my God.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.797
-Get out.
-Does that say "Super Cock"?

06:20.880 --> 06:24.050
No, it says, "Super Clock." Clock.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.343
The "L" just fell down.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.428
I can see every square inch
of your genitals.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.639
It's like when they vacuum pack meat
at the supermarket.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.808
It's for a Halloween party. It's ironic.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.101
No way. Let me get my phone.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.269
No!

07:00.461 --> 07:01.838
Come on.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.434
Don't come in. I'm… masturbating.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.520
Okay. Carrie said she'd be home late.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.230
Okay. I'm just finishing.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.657
Do you want a cup of tea?

07:31.367 --> 07:32.368
Yeah. Go on.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.918
He's obviously been mistreated.
He's skin and bone.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.088
He's a dump truck. The landlord won't
let you keep it in the flat anyway.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.007
-'Cause all landlords are evil.
-All landlords are evil.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.383
-Yes.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.635
-Hello.
-How was work?

07:53.431 --> 07:55.808
Everyone always gets angry with me
when it goes badly.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.519
I'm just the messenger.
It's not me saying it.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.689
Yeah, you're just a vessel.
Like a sexy little carafe.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.191
Aw.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.359
-Thank you, babe.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.236
-Well, why don't you just quit?
-Yeah, quit.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.362
I can't just quit.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.198
Right. You have dependants.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.200
-I'm looking for a job.
-Yeah.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.453
He spends all day in his room
applying for jobs. Don't you, babe?

08:15.536 --> 08:16.537
Yes.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.748
It pays well.

08:18.831 --> 08:23.044
And they don't just use me for my power.
They also ask me to make teas and coffees.

08:26.547 --> 08:29.592
Oh, no. I'm basically an appliance.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.385
Look, it could always be worse.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.305
Don't put yourself down like that, Jen.

08:35.598 --> 08:39.393
Or do you mean in general?
Oh, you meant in general, didn't you?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.478
Yeah.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.271
You are such a brave little soldier.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.441
Carrie, I haven't got a power yet.
I'm not, like, terminal.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.529
Hey. Maybe the real power
is just being yourself.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.864
That is the dumbest fucking thing
I've ever heard in my life.

08:51.948 --> 08:52.949
Absolutely not true. No.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.076
I know what will cheer you up.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.494
I'm not sad.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.299
Oh, God. Not you again.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.427
Hey, Hitler. Yeah, suck a dick. Everyone's
cool with interracial marriage now.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.681
Yeah, you're inside my white girlfriend,
and we fuck at least twice a month.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.598
Ooh! Who am I?

09:17.682 --> 09:20.560
Let's invade Russia in
the winter because I'm a big dumb bitch.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.019
Okay.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.104
Very funny.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.772
Oh, the Jews are broadly doing okay.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.566
-Yeah.
-La, la, la, la!

09:26.649 --> 09:28.401
I'm not listening.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.278
-This is really childish.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.076
Right. Well,
I'm off to go get railed by a stranger.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.228
-Oh, um--

10:04.312 --> 10:06.272
Sorry, I just need to put my glove on.

10:06.355 --> 10:07.773
-Oh.

10:11.652 --> 10:12.820
Nice to meet you.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.405
Big Michael Jackson fan?

10:14.488 --> 10:16.115
No, he's an alleged sex offender.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.368
Right. Good we've established that early.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.790
Ooh! Vegan lasagne.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.171
I want to be completely honest with you.

10:34.008 --> 10:40.097
I have the power to make people orgasm
with my touch.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.392
Whoa.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.646
-That's, um… That's really cool.
-It's not cool. It's not.

10:46.729 --> 10:50.900
It's a common misconception that literally
everyone I've ever met seems to hold.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.611
So, what's your power?

10:53.694 --> 10:55.905
Uh, I'm still waiting.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.573
Your profile said you were 25.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.451
-I am. Just a late bloomer.
-I've never met anyone who waited so long.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.662
So how did you find out
the whole come thing then?

11:02.745 --> 11:04.622
I bet it's a funny story.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.207
It's not a funny story, no.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.418
I promise not to laugh.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.882
It was my father's 60th birthday.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.845
We'd been estranged for some years,
so it was a reunion of sorts.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.348
We were kicking a football around,

11:22.431 --> 11:25.267
which had always been
a boyhood dream of mine.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.854
I saved an errant kick, which would've
shattered a conservatory window.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.733
For the first time in my life, I felt like
my father respected me as a man.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.780
Then he asked if he could shake my hand.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.157
Oh, I see.

11:40.866 --> 11:41.867
I was so proud.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.537
My entire extended family were there
to witness the moment.

11:45.579 --> 11:50.126
They were all watching
as the, uh, moment of contact arrived.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.210
Oh, no.

11:51.293 --> 11:55.089
He was wearing light-grey khakis so it was
very obvious what was occurring.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.465
Of course, I was very confused.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.135
He was doubled over.
I thought he was having a heart attack.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.597
So I opened his shirt
to begin performing chest compressions.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.516
-And every time you--
-Yes.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.691
Yeah, no, you're right. That is not funny.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.777
-Khakis were ruined.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.239
Kash, you cannot seriously
believe A.D. stands for "after dinosaurs."

12:20.322 --> 12:23.451
It does. 500 A.D.
500 years after dinosaurs.

12:23.534 --> 12:24.702
What else would it be?

12:25.202 --> 12:27.329
These shoes are so uncomfortable.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.664
Then why'd you wear them?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.542
When you said you booked dinner,
I thought it might be a fancy date.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.961
I didn't even know you could book a table
at Bucket O' Pizza.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.671
And normally you can't…

12:35.755 --> 12:37.798
…but I've got a special relationship
with the manager.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.513
-What are you doing?
-Take these.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.640
-Oh, you-- You don't have to.
-Take the shoes.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.272
Thank you.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.235
-Hey!
-Give me your purse.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.904
-And empty your pockets.
-Um.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.072
Uh, here.
Uh, take my phone.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.825
That piece of shit. Nah, mate.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.036
-The purse. Give it!
-No, I've got money.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.496
-Um.
-Come on. Quickly.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.791
-Just in my…
-Now! I'm not fucking around!

13:11.874 --> 13:13.501
-In my pocket!

13:13.584 --> 13:15.419
-Come on!
-Ow! Right in the eye!

13:17.588 --> 13:18.756
I'm gonna kiss you now.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.781
Would you like to…

13:43.864 --> 13:44.907
Yeah.

13:56.919 --> 13:57.878
Oh, uh--

13:57.962 --> 13:59.129
What are you doing?

13:59.713 --> 14:01.674
It's important to me
to know that I can do it myself.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.948
-Maybe just take the glove--
-Give me a minute.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.590
Oh. Oh, ye--

14:43.173 --> 14:45.134
Oh, yeah.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.218
Oh, my God.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.554
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was it.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.180
I just came.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.682
-You're welcome.
-Hmm.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.521
I think we should take it slow.

15:14.455 --> 15:15.497
Just to be safe.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.474
Did you see me? I was all, like…

15:33.557 --> 15:35.309
Yeah, it was very brave of you.

15:35.392 --> 15:36.393
I should go after him.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.937
No, no. Don't do that.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.563
But he committed a crime.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.191
You bought your drug dealer
a birthday card last year.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.568
He committed a crime on me. On you.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.905
Someone needs to clean up those streets.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.368
I am that hero. This is my destiny.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.287
Great. Is this destiny gonna be salaried?

15:55.371 --> 15:56.747
Gonna become a vigilante.

15:56.830 --> 15:57.915
Oh, no.

15:57.998 --> 16:01.418
No, I'm gonna assemble
a team of vigilantes.

16:01.502 --> 16:05.047
Oh, Carrie. This is my origin story!
Quick, take a picture!

16:05.130 --> 16:07.967
No, no, there's no time.
I've got so much mood-boarding to do.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.264
I'll get the Pritt sticks.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.367
Shoo!

16:33.450 --> 16:34.910
Go away.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.496
Don't you dare touch him.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.259
-Oh, God!

16:57.307 --> 16:58.767
I don't think it's gonna work out.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.561
Fair enough.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.855
Good game.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.486
Oh, please. Come on. Uh, just the one?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.995
-Oy, Jizzlord.
-Don't call him that.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.122
He likes it. You got a better one?

17:20.914 --> 17:24.001
-I don't know. Like, Cum Bucket?

17:24.084 --> 17:25.794
Jesus Christ. That is so much worse.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.212
I thought it was cute.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.672
It's no Jizzlord.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.883
-So, we are keeping him then?

17:30.966 --> 17:33.552
-Have you checked if he's got an owner?
-No, he's definitely a stray.

17:33.635 --> 17:37.222
He's got an energy.
He's scrappy. He's lived a life.

17:38.682 --> 17:39.683
Haven't you got work today?

17:39.767 --> 17:41.477
Yeah. Don't have to leave
till 11.00 though.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.103
It's half past two.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.773
Fuck.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.067
Turn back time and tell me to leave.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.526
You know I can't go back that far.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.778
Yeah, I'm still gonna be late,

17:50.861 --> 17:52.362
but it means I can stop
at Pret on the way.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.740
Jen, I am burdened with a noble gift.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.451
I'm not gonna use it for inane reasons.
With great power come--

17:57.534 --> 17:59.661
-Just do it, you fucking nerd.
-Okay, okay!

18:20.057 --> 18:21.558
Can you do me up with some balloons?

18:21.642 --> 18:24.478
I want them to say,
"Happy 18th Birthday, Andy.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.564
Mum is making me do this.
We were never close, and I hate you."

18:28.315 --> 18:29.942
I can do "Happy 18th."

18:30.025 --> 18:31.401
Fine.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.280
-Jennifer.
-Angela.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.658
Are those for personal use?

18:38.158 --> 18:39.201
Yes.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.203
Jen.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.622
Jen.

18:44.456 --> 18:47.000
Why didn't you tell me
you're going to a party, you cheeky bint?

18:47.084 --> 18:48.252
Tell me all about it.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.295
It's my half-sister's 18th.
It's a family thing.

18:50.379 --> 18:53.090
Say no more.
Family can be a real bash in the fanny.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.677
You love 'em. You hate 'em,
but you're stuck with 'em.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.803
What can you do?

19:00.097 --> 19:01.932
I'd hate to be turning 18 now.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.684
Nothing's the same
after you get your power.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.811
-I used to play at Wimbledon--
-Wimbledon.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.521
We know, love. Jesus.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.816
It's not my fault I didn't get superspeed
or racket hands.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.192
Tell me about it, flower.

19:12.276 --> 19:16.363
Gonna be 56 in April. Can't even buy
some paracetamol in Asda.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.115
Don't let it get you down, love.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.285
I'm not down.
Honestly, I really don't even care.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.661
Back to work.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.546
Do you want to know how you die?

19:33.797 --> 19:34.798
What?

19:35.340 --> 19:36.675
Foresight.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.721
No.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.807
Probably for the best.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.269
What do you mean it's probably
for the best? Wha--

19:47.352 --> 19:48.645
-Is it bad?

19:48.729 --> 19:49.563
One minute.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.734
Hi. Bang on time.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.361
<i>It's not like I've anything better to do.</i>

19:56.862 --> 19:57.863
True.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.573
<i>Got a new one for you.</i>

20:00.449 --> 20:02.534
Fine. Go on. Get it over with.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.661
<i>Knock, knock.</i>

20:04.745 --> 20:05.829
Who's there?

20:05.913 --> 20:07.456
-<i>Boo.</i>
-Boo, who?

20:07.539 --> 20:09.374
<i>Cheer up, love. It might never happen.</i>

20:09.875 --> 20:12.252
Jesus Christ.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.421
<i>Well, how are things your end?</i>

20:14.504 --> 20:16.089
It's Andy's 18th tonight.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.507
<i>Oh, good luck with that.</i>

20:17.591 --> 20:18.759
Thought you'd reassure me.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.385
<i>God, no. It's gonna be awful.</i>

20:20.469 --> 20:22.804
<i>Just try not to make everything</i>
<i>into a competition.</i>

20:22.888 --> 20:24.973
I don't do that. She does that.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.893
<i>Well, you know where I am.</i>
<i>Say hi to your mum for me.</i>

20:29.394 --> 20:30.395
Yeah.

20:36.818 --> 20:37.861
Hey.

20:38.987 --> 20:39.988
Bears.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.615
Huh?

20:41.698 --> 20:44.243
How you die. Bears.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.412
Oh, but…

21:11.853 --> 21:14.481
-Wow.

21:14.564 --> 21:15.565
Bravo.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.028
Oh, my baby!

21:22.155 --> 21:23.240
Why are there already balloons?

21:23.323 --> 21:26.201
Oh, those? They're nothing. I just nipped
out this morning and got a few.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.577
But you asked me to get balloons.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.997
-I know.
-What, you don't trust me to get balloons?

21:30.080 --> 21:34.042
Oh, I don't want it to play HDMI.
Just play Andy's party playlist.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.877
I got an audition
for the Greenwich Conservatoire.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.797
Normal human thing to do is
to say hello before you start bragging.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.008
I'm just sharing good news
about my life with my sister.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.635
I'm sure if you achieve something,
you'd do the same. No?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.554
Andy, stop haranguing your sister.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.431
-Have you got a job yet?
-I have a job.

21:47.514 --> 21:51.768
A real job.
I didn't leave my home and family

21:51.852 --> 21:55.314
and brave the boat to England
for you to squander all my sacrifices.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.898
We definitely flew here.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.652
You were young. You don't
understand the immigrant struggle.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.196
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing here.
Where's the antenna?

22:03.280 --> 22:04.531
What do you think my power's gonna be?

22:04.614 --> 22:06.867
You do know you're not gonna
get your power the second you turn 18?

22:06.950 --> 22:09.619
What do you know about powers?
You're like a virgin talking about sex.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.372
-You're like the pope.
-I-I am not the pope. I fuck.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.915
-No, Mum. Tell her I fuck.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.752
Would you whist? I'm trying
to get this thing to play music.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.588
-Why is it still just showing me pictures?
-Just wait for Ian to do it.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.882
What's the point of having a power
if you don't use it?

22:21.965 --> 22:23.800
Being able to control technology
is only useful

22:23.884 --> 22:25.177
if you know how technology works.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.762
I think you're doing a great job, Mum.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.264
-Just Bing it, will you?
-Bing!

22:29.348 --> 22:33.560
Ladies, ladies, please. I know
we're feeling a little… stressed?

22:34.728 --> 22:35.812
Excited.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.191
Oh, Lord.
Now, what have we got going on in there?

22:39.274 --> 22:41.860
Angry, sad, jealous.

22:41.943 --> 22:42.944
Horny?

22:43.028 --> 22:44.363
Uh…

22:44.446 --> 22:47.115
Three, two, one…

22:48.116 --> 22:49.701
-Yes!

22:51.036 --> 22:52.788
Happy birthday!

22:58.126 --> 22:59.336
Try turning on the TV.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.638
Can you sense any emotion? Deep breath.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.352
No. I've got nothing.

23:16.812 --> 23:20.107
Don't worry.
It doesn't always happen on the day.

23:20.190 --> 23:23.026
It can take a few days or weeks. Or…

23:24.486 --> 23:25.821
I wanted it today.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.365
Aw, no. Oh, I'm playing
the world's smallest violin.

23:29.366 --> 23:32.994
I've actually played the world's smallest
violin, and it's much bigger than that.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.339
You're a little bit happy
she didn't get it.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.424
Uh, duh, Ian.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.050
My cousin was like you.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.761
Then he went to one of those clinics
that help you bring out your power.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.638
No, I am not doing that. It's pathetic.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.891
Really helped him.
Now he can freeze anything. Like that.

23:57.561 --> 24:01.064
Of course, he's got a freezer that
he mainly uses, but it's the knowledge.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.732
Like, knowing you don't need--

24:03.608 --> 24:04.609
Okay!

24:07.446 --> 24:09.281
-I'm super strong!

24:10.532 --> 24:11.783
Oh, my God.

24:11.867 --> 24:16.121
-That's amazing! Do the sofa.
-Sofa!

24:30.343 --> 24:33.180
Oh, my-- Oh, my God, I'm on the ceiling!

24:34.973 --> 24:37.517
We just going to ignore the fact
she broke the fridge or--

24:38.727 --> 24:40.395
One hand!

24:43.815 --> 24:44.816
I killed a man!

24:48.570 --> 24:52.073
Hi, hello. Up here. I'm up here.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.660
Can your daughter do this?
No, only my daughter!

24:55.744 --> 24:59.122
Andy! Andy, I'm so high!

25:00.290 --> 25:02.000
Andy! Andy!

25:19.017 --> 25:21.520
Surprise. I wasn't sure
what the deal was with the party,

25:21.603 --> 25:23.563
so I thought I'd bring the party to you.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.773
Oh.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.441
Uh, it's not really a great…

25:27.234 --> 25:28.527
time.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.201
Oh, hi.

25:36.284 --> 25:39.829
Who are you?
That sounds rude, but who are you?

25:39.913 --> 25:41.206
Um, my name's Olivia.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.750
Of course it is.
So is, um-- Is this a date?

25:43.833 --> 25:45.961
-Yeah.
-Wouldn't really call it a date.

25:46.044 --> 25:49.047
Oh. Well, if it's not a date,
there's no harm in joining. Right?

25:55.095 --> 25:56.638
Olivia can shape-shift.

25:56.721 --> 26:00.267
Oh. Uh, so this is what you've chosen
to look like. Oh, that makes sense.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.602
No. Honestly, I never really use it.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.896
I think it's important to love yourself
the way you are.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.941
You know,
flaws and imperfections and everything.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.235
So, you just look like this all the time?

26:11.069 --> 26:12.529
Wow. Fantastic.

26:12.612 --> 26:13.863
I don't even wear make-up.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.073
Oh, my God.

26:15.156 --> 26:16.283
Yeah.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.367
Yeah.

26:20.495 --> 26:21.871
I like your hair like that.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.290
Thanks!

26:23.373 --> 26:25.792
-What do you call that style?
-Down?

26:25.875 --> 26:26.876
It suits you.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.755
-Have you been to the pier?
-No!

26:31.256 --> 26:32.591
My turn!

26:43.310 --> 26:44.728
Great. Let's go.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.106
Oh, um, maybe next time?

26:48.189 --> 26:50.817
-Oh, come on.
-Well, it's kinda hard work.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.902
And you need to think about load bearing.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.029
Load bearing?

26:55.447 --> 26:56.823
Okay. Come on, then.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.202
'Kay.

27:05.498 --> 27:06.833
Hmm.

27:06.916 --> 27:07.917
Yeah.

27:08.001 --> 27:12.130
-Oh, Christ. Oh, fuck. Okay.
-Yeah, okay. Yeah.

27:12.213 --> 27:13.673
Sorry. Sorry. My feet smell.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.262
Fuck me, that's very high!

27:19.346 --> 27:20.805
-Don't look down.
-Don't look down.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.349
Not so tight.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.356
So, uh, is she your girlfriend?

27:29.439 --> 27:31.650
Look,
why do we have to put labels on things?

27:31.733 --> 27:32.942
Because labels are great.

27:33.026 --> 27:36.029
You know, I label my yogurt at work
because people kept eating my yogurt.

27:36.112 --> 27:39.157
And it's my yogurt, you know. I bought it,
and I want it. It's a great yogurt.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.243
I mean, it's creamy and low-fat
and has beautiful eyes.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.245
You need to let go.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.914
I don't want to let you go.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.540
No, as in let go of me.
We're on the ground.

27:47.624 --> 27:48.625
Oh.

27:52.379 --> 27:53.546
Jen, look at me.

27:53.630 --> 27:57.550
If you don't love yourself, how the hell
are you gonna love somebody else?

28:08.978 --> 28:09.979
That's RuPaul.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.774
That's RuPaul!

28:21.199 --> 28:24.577
<i>Wasn't expecting you</i>
<i>to call at this hour. Everything okay?</i>

28:24.661 --> 28:27.080
<i>You haven't been murdered or something,</i>
<i>have you?</i>

28:27.747 --> 28:29.582
-I want a power.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.961
I want one so badly.
It's never gonna happen.

28:33.044 --> 28:36.506
<i>Yeah, you're right.</i>
<i>You should probably just give up.</i>

28:36.589 --> 28:38.174
You're not supposed to say that.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.802
<i>Well, what do you want me to say?</i>
<i>Accept it.</i>

28:40.885 --> 28:43.179
<i>It's just not something</i>
<i>you're ever going to have.</i>

28:44.180 --> 28:46.558
-You don't know that.
-<i>But you do somehow?</i>

28:47.267 --> 28:48.685
<i>You really want this power thing?</i>

28:51.438 --> 28:53.106
Yes, I do.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.860
<i>Well, if you think it will make you happy…</i>

28:59.028 --> 29:00.613
<i>…then go get it.</i>

29:01.656 --> 29:03.241
<i>I'm sure you'll figure it out.</i>

29:05.452 --> 29:06.578
What if I don't?

29:06.661 --> 29:08.747
<i>Then we'll figure something out together.</i>

29:16.254 --> 29:17.255
Dad?

29:17.797 --> 29:18.798
<i>Yeah?</i>

29:19.799 --> 29:20.800
Can I do the thing?

29:22.385 --> 29:23.636
<i>You don't have to ask.</i>

29:38.526 --> 29:39.527
Hi, pet.

30:28.910 --> 30:33.248
<i>Welcome to Discovery Clinic,</i>
<i>where your powers journey begins.</i>

30:49.055 --> 30:53.309
Hi. Welcome. Are you looking to start
your power journey today?

30:53.393 --> 30:57.230
Yes. I am, Denise. I'd like to book
myself in for a discovery package.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.774
-And how long have you been trying?
-Six years.

30:59.858 --> 31:04.571
Ooh. That is a long time. But don't worry.
You're in the right place.

31:04.654 --> 31:08.032
We have an excellent track record
in helping people to discover their power.
