I'm going to need
a list of the people
that could get downsized.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.744
Sheriff, open the car.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.547
Me?
Yeah, this might
be a crime scene.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.212
How would it look
if I compromised evidence

10:36.344 --> 10:39.006
for my first gig
as medical examiner?

10:43.184 --> 10:44.173
That's the smell.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.971
Tuna,egg,and
cream cheese burrito,

10:46.104 --> 10:47.969
with horseradish.
Ugh!

10:48.356 --> 10:49.687
You want a bite?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.182
No, I'm good.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.372
ALLISON: Dr. Monroe?
That's terrible.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.042
l was just getting to
know her because
of the baby shower.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.332
Yeah, Fargo's doing
the autopsy right now.

11:13.464 --> 11:14.624
It could have
been an accident.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.885
Or it could have been
one of the people on
this grant list.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.217
The car was
perfectly sealed.
(BEEPING)

11:19.345 --> 11:20.721
Someone had to fill it.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.634
We've narrowed
it down to four.
The rest have alibis.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.143
So you think
that G.D. scientists
are killing each other

11:26.269 --> 11:28.510
over grant research?
That's ridiculous.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.102
No one on that list
is capable of...

11:30.231 --> 11:32.893
I know of two,
Draper and Bell.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.607
The type-A's
that I planned
your party with.

11:34.736 --> 11:35.816
They would eat
their own young

11:35.945 --> 11:37.651
if they thought
it would impress you.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.906
Carter, please find out
what happened.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.988
Top priority before
rumors start to spread.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.106
Sure.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.239
Draper did it.
(SIGHS) See what I mean?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.077
Fargo, please don't
jump to conclusions.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.492
These are people
that we know.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.287
Well, all I know is
Dr. Monroe's lungs were
like sponges.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.501
Every cell in her body
was bursting with water.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.837
Yeah, but isn't
that what happens
when someone drowns?

11:55.965 --> 11:59.332
Not unless there's
a super-absorbency
technology involved.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.879
Sound familiar?

12:01.095 --> 12:03.552
Death by Draper-Diap.
I rest my case.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.263
Well, Draper's research
does involve micro-fibers,

12:06.392 --> 12:08.769
that if inhaled or ingested
in major quantities

12:08.895 --> 12:11.386
might cause this kind of
water retention.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.808
Okay, I'll find Draper.
You want to talk to Bell?

12:13.942 --> 12:15.807
And, Fargo, if you'd check
the body for microfibers.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.152
Hey, and no speculation
until we figure
this thing out.

have the mimosas last night?

12:25.787 --> 12:28.950
Oh, I learned that lesson
at an astronomy conference
in Puerto Rico.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.037
Mmm.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.124
Oh, and by the way,
there's an asteroid
event tomorrow night.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.459
Feel like
stargazing again?

were that into it.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.842
Oh, I am, I am.
And actually, tell Henry

12:46.975 --> 12:48.636
I'm going to stop by later
after I figure out

12:48.768 --> 12:51.225
how a woman could drown
in the middle of a highway.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.310
(SIGHS) Hell of a hangover.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.064
Bye.

12:58.403 --> 13:02.737
I am so confused.
I thought he liked me.
Carter?

13:02.865 --> 13:05.948
Well, we went on this date
and I thought we had
agmmﬂme

13:06.077 --> 13:08.318
Oh! You went on a date?

13:08.746 --> 13:09.826
No, an almost date.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.414

Oh, God, I suck at this.

I mean, I think I do.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.510
Dad, is Dr. Monroe
really dead?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.804
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.267
Do you have any leads?

13:34.397 --> 13:35.603
Maybe.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.519
(STAMMERS) Yeah, could you
make me one of those to go?

13:38.651 --> 13:39.686
I'm just starving.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.059
Okay.
Sorry.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.941

the, uh, Draper-Diap?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.082
I don't plan on
letting them beat me.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.702
Well, just like you didn't
want Monroe to beat you
to next year's grant?

Monroe for years.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.132
I'm very competitive.
I didn't kill her.

Now, if you'll excuse me.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.099

the rest of you.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.319
So do you think
this is okay?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.685
It's what
we need to do.

14:24.822 --> 14:28.531
I need to know
what you think, Henry.
You're the one I trust.

stop in mid-process,
we might damage the data.

Dr. Draper?

16:32.408 --> 16:33.818
(GASPS)

16:36.037 --> 16:38.073
I think we've
found our leak.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.131
My preliminary,
albeit well-trained,

16:51.260 --> 16:55.299
forensic analysis leads me
to the obvious conclusion.
She drowned.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.841
Dr. Monroe also drowned
and they were both at
the baby shower.

17:02.313 --> 17:06.477
I get it how someone could
absorb water or drown in
a flooded car,

17:06.609 --> 17:08.975
but, I mean, in a bathroom?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.692
Well, I mean, maybe
it was out of the air?

17:10.821 --> 17:11.856
It's been humid
since the storm.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.401
Doubtful, even with
a high vapor pressure,

17:14.534 --> 17:18.322
you couldn't precipitate
that much liquid from
the atmosphere.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.820
(SIGHS)
So where did
the water come from?

17:21.791 --> 17:23.076
From them.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.286
Them, who?

17:25.419 --> 17:27.330
Monroe and Draper.
Maybe they weren't
absorbing water,

17:27.463 --> 17:28.498
maybe they were
making it.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.088
Well, the human body
only holds about
ten gallons of water.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.332
That wouldn't
fill up a car.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.210
Draper was sweating so badly
that a glass of water slipped
right out of her hand.

17:35.346 --> 17:38.838
Maybe she was
making extra water,
like overproducing it.

17:38.975 --> 17:42.217
I'll need to
see more evidence
to buy that theory.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.060
(WATER SQUIRTING)

17:53.114 --> 17:55.070

test the water.

17:56.534 --> 17:57.614

17:58.953 --> 18:00.864
Look, I've been all
over the diagnostics

18:00.997 --> 18:02.908
and there was
no malfunction
in the system.

18:03.040 --> 18:03.825
Look again.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.040
Henry, Kim reacted
so violently

18:06.168 --> 18:08.250
because her cellular
structure is changing.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.620
Well, it's understandable.
She's been exposed to
new stimuli,

18:10.756 --> 18:12.621
but new neural pathways
should form...

18:12.758 --> 18:14.089

18:14.218 --> 18:17.130
She's decaying and we're
not exactly sure why.

But if we can't find another
way to access that data,

18:20.016 --> 18:22.883
it could all be gone
in a matter of days,
maybe hours.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.514
And because
she is the data...

18:28.024 --> 18:29.685
She'll be gone.

No, actually.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.577
It's synthetic.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.246
Dr. Rivers makes it
in her lab.

still fine though, right?

Well, there's fine
and then there's perfect.

Nothing in your lungs,

21:26.035 --> 21:28.993
but your condition
is serious.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.821
What condition is that?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.164
Couvade Syndrome.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.624
I had Bruce examine you.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.415
He's an expert on
neural pathway anomalies.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.038
How serious is this?

21:44.011 --> 21:45.376
You're pregnant.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.425
Excuse me?

21:49.558 --> 21:51.594
(LAUGHS)
It's sympathy pregnancy.

21:51.727 --> 21:52.842
Some men can
develop symptoms

21:52.978 --> 21:55.765
when they worry too much
about their pregnant...

21:56.357 --> 21:57.938
Their birthing partners.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.766
So I'm feeling this
because of you?

22:01.111 --> 22:03.523
The mind is
a very powerful force.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.898
If you believe
in something long enough,
the body can make it happen.

22:07.034 --> 22:07.989
I don't understand.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.825
I was exposed to the water
that came out of Monroe,

22:10.955 --> 22:13.617
and Zoe was exposed to
the water that came
out of Draper.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.411
We know that syn water
can't enter the body
through contact.

22:16.544 --> 22:17.909
It has to be absorbed

Hey, Jo.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.129
Yeah, I'll be right there.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.345
Well, drink
a Red Bull, Fargo.
We've got another case.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.089
Someone else
from my shower?

22:32.226 --> 22:34.262
No ID yet,
but I want everyone
who was at that party

22:34.395 --> 22:35.384
tested for syn water.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.513
Just because I'm fine
doesn't mean that
everyone else will be.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.644
I found her
this morning
when I opened up.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.813
She usually closes
the place by herself
after she finishes cleaning.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.686
And she was here
all day before that?

22:45.823 --> 22:47.563
Yeah. Her shift
starts at noon.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.112
She takes care of the steam
and sauna during the day,

22:50.244 --> 22:52.906
then sanitizes
the whole area
after she's done.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.822
(JO SIGHS)

22:56.250 --> 22:58.912
Guess this kills our theory
that the baby shower was
the cause.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.126
Maybe this one
was just clumsy.

23:01.672 --> 23:05.130
Slipped, whacked her head,
and drowned in the tub.
It's possible.

23:05.259 --> 23:09.002
I don't think so. I mean,
she's wearing rubber gloves.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.971
You don't fill
the tub with water
to clean it, right?

23:12.141 --> 23:14.382
It was empty
when she started.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.847
So this one turned into
Old Faithful like the others.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.891
CARTER: So it wasn't
the baby shower.
(WHIRRING)

23:20.190 --> 23:22.476
But she must have
something in common
with Monroe and Draper.

She does.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.031
CARTER: Was it syn water?

23:39.418 --> 23:43.081
Yeah. Good thing
we started to test
people from the shower.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.374
We caught Dr. Bell
before her lungs
started to fill.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.338
She would've only had
five minutes after that.

23:47.468 --> 23:48.457
She's the only one?

23:48.594 --> 23:52.337
So far. We can arrest
her drowning symptoms by
artificially respirating her

23:52.473 --> 23:54.805
until we can figure out
what's causing this.

23:54.934 --> 23:59.268
Fargo, didn't you
say something about
syn water in the bloodstream?

23:59.396 --> 24:00.977
Not absorbed through
surface contact.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.188
Has to enter
the bloodstream directly.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.852
All right. Is that
what we're looking at?

24:04.985 --> 24:06.100
Potentially.

24:08.030 --> 24:11.022
Kim's suffering
from a degeneration
of the organic tissue.

24:11.158 --> 24:16.369
Because her original
cell structure had no
Earth-centric immunities.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.403
That was my call
back then,

24:18.540 --> 24:20.326
I thought it would
free up more space

24:20.459 --> 24:21.824
within the cell
for data storage.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.667
And you were right,
but that's why
it's imperative

24:23.796 --> 24:26.833
we access the data
before it disappears.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.172
Before she dies.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.917
We submerge her
in an acid solution.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.715
Break up the individual
nanobytes of data...

24:33.847 --> 24:34.927
You want to dissolve her.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.469

I know, but...

24:37.601 --> 24:40.934

to be another way.
Look, give me 24 hours.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.928
Well, I can give
you until midnight.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.972

it will take for us
to prepare the procedure.

24:45.109 --> 24:46.098
Fine.

24:48.362 --> 24:49.898

more analysis of
your water

24:50.030 --> 24:52.066
and we found
something interesting.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.987
The syn water we found
in the victim's body is
perfectly harmless

24:56.120 --> 25:01.080
until it's added directly
to human plasma.

25:01.917 --> 25:06.126
At which point,
Old Faithful.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.580
Then it must
be something within
their specific plasma.

25:09.717 --> 25:13.926
No, sorry,
that was a generic
sample from the infirmary.

to shut down your lab

25:18.100 --> 25:19.636

test everything.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.884
You also said that
the water that comes
in here is recycled,

25:22.021 --> 25:24.353
so you must
have a filtration
system or something.

Come on!
Security lockdown engaged.

(GASPING)

32:15.142 --> 32:17.053
(COUGHING)

32:25.110 --> 32:26.395
Where's Tess?

32:26.528 --> 32:29.019
Stuck in that elevator.
Some kind of security problem.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.111
Did Fargo test her
with the other women?

32:30.240 --> 32:32.902
No, you ruled out
that shower connection
before we got to her. Why?

32:33.034 --> 32:34.023
How long has
she been in there?

32:34.161 --> 32:35.901
A few minutes.
I'll get an emergency team.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.028
No time. She only has five
minutes before she drowns!

32:38.165 --> 32:40.030
Get him in
that elevator shaft.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.825
(GRUNTING) Why is
it always heights?

32:45.338 --> 32:48.045
ALLISON: (ON HEADSET)
I've entered the security code
for the hatch.

32:52.179 --> 32:54.465
I'm still trying to
get manual override
in the elevator.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.930
(GRUNTS)
Wait, I got her!

32:58.393 --> 32:59.508
Tess?

33:02.481 --> 33:04.142
CARTER: All right,
she has a pulse,
but she's not breathing!

33:04.274 --> 33:05.434
A medical team's on the way.

33:05.567 --> 33:08.309
Yeah, well,
that's going
to be too late.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.900
(PANTING)

33:18.038 --> 33:20.120
(GASPING)

33:20.749 --> 33:21.738
(COUGHING)

33:23.543 --> 33:24.783
You're going to be okay.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.000
Keep putting air
in her lungs.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.962
They're going to continue
filling with fluid until
we can drain them.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.079
Uh...

33:30.467 --> 33:32.082
Not how I saw
our first kiss,

33:32.219 --> 33:34.460
but I'm going to breathe
for you, okay?

33:40.352 --> 33:42.308
You're going to be okay.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.191
How are you feeling?

33:52.197 --> 33:54.028
It hurts to breathe.

33:54.741 --> 33:57.983
They're draining
the water from your lungs
as fast as they can.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.620
I'm scared.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.247
You'll be fine.

34:01.665 --> 34:02.996
(EXHALES)

34:04.125 --> 34:05.535
Just rest.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.997
Hey, guys, give me
some good news.

34:12.133 --> 34:13.418
Well, I wish there was.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.127
We can keep her alive
in here like Dr. Bell.

34:17.806 --> 34:20.593
Well, that's a start,
but it's not a solution.

34:20.725 --> 34:24.684
The compressed water
she inhaled in the steam room
could take months to expel.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.939
Her organs could
give out before then.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.819
I'm sorry.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.773
(EXHALING)

34:50.672 --> 34:52.458
She loved you, Henry.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.716
And I loved her.

35:07.063 --> 35:10.647
Got to say goodbye to you

35:11.693 --> 35:15.606
Got to really, really try

35:17.240 --> 35:18.946
And I won't...

35:19.075 --> 35:22.283
Okay, activating laser.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.573
(ELECTRONIC BUZZING)

35:28.293 --> 35:30.909
should undo the bonds
that hold her form together.

35:31.046 --> 35:34.209
As that happens,
the data should
begin to release.

35:41.765 --> 35:43.596
(SIGHS)

35:44.142 --> 35:45.427
Oh, my God.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.144
Kim gave this
to you, Henry.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.138
You'll always have
a part of her.

35:52.859 --> 35:55.271
(SNIFFLING)
Yes, lwill.

35:56.863 --> 36:00.481
I want to hold you tight

36:01.159 --> 36:04.151
Like you were all mine

36:04.287 --> 36:08.075
I might live my life with you

36:08.208 --> 36:13.248
All I want to do
is live my life

36:13.380 --> 36:17.089
with you

36:19.386 --> 36:21.126
Download complete.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.758
Looks like
we got it all.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.221
(SNIFFLES)

36:40.573 --> 36:42.609
I am so sorry
for his loss.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.859
How's Tess?

36:48.289 --> 36:49.495
Um...

36:50.709 --> 36:52.119
She's not good.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.037
Maybe we're not
putting the right
technology together.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.298
There's someone I need
to introduce you to.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.680
There you go.

37:08.643 --> 37:09.678
Will it work?

37:09.811 --> 37:11.017
All depends on Manlius.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.932
If he can calibrate
his radiation correctly,

37:13.064 --> 37:15.476
it should be able to
break the specific
molecular bond

37:15.608 --> 37:18.736
and release all
the compressed syn water
inside of her intact.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.022
And if it doesn't?

37:20.155 --> 37:23.397
He could decompress
all the remaining
syn water at once.

37:23.742 --> 37:24.902
And she'll drown.

37:25.034 --> 37:27.286
Yeah, we wouldn't be
able to drain it
quickly enough.

37:33.918 --> 37:36.876
We've got her
in a nutrient bath
that Kim and I developed.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.495
That'll protect her
from the radiation

37:38.631 --> 37:41.964
long enough for the syn
molecules to get released.

37:42.093 --> 37:46.132
And once they're out,
then we can all breathe
easier, especially Tess.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.470
Thank you, Henry.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.965
MANLIUS: All right,
I need to take
the respirator now.

37:50.935 --> 37:55.144
You will have to
go undenNater and
breathe with this.

37:57.984 --> 38:01.852
Until we can disperse
enough molecules for
your lungs to empty,

38:03.114 --> 38:05.196
it will feel
like you're drowning.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.826
Tess, I know you can
do this. All right?

38:32.393 --> 38:34.099
(BUZZING)

38:38.483 --> 38:40.348
Okay, it's working
on my end.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.146
(WHIRRING)

38:43.071 --> 38:44.607
I'm not tracking any release.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.072
Jeez.

38:57.293 --> 39:02.413
Come on. Come on, Tess.
I don't know how much
longer I can expose her.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.881
It's working!
We have release.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.390
The compressed molecules
are coming out of
her lungs intact.

39:11.516 --> 39:12.926
She's just got to hold on.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.390
She can do it.

39:21.943 --> 39:22.932
(MONITOR BEEPING)

39:23.069 --> 39:24.434

39:25.154 --> 39:26.280

39:51.097 --> 39:53.008
(EXHALES)
Just what I wanted.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.967
You know,
I'm starting to
get used to this.

39:57.270 --> 40:00.307
I've got to say,
it's exhausting, but, um,

40:02.609 --> 40:04.145
it's kind of nice.

40:04.277 --> 40:08.316
I wasn't very good being
around when Abby was
pregnant with Zoe,

40:08.990 --> 40:11.697
so, um, thanks.

40:13.828 --> 40:14.817
(CHUCKLES)

40:14.954 --> 40:16.285
And when is our
first birthing class?

40:16.414 --> 40:17.403
(LAUGHS)

40:17.540 --> 40:21.408
Oh, Carter,
you remember this?

40:22.337 --> 40:24.293
Uh, yeah, yeah,
that's the, um...

40:24.422 --> 40:25.958
The high-tech baby
monitor from the shower.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.797
The thing that's supposed
to make you feel what
the baby feels, right?

40:28.927 --> 40:31.088
Right, or...

40:33.389 --> 40:36.347
Instead of connecting
me to the baby,
it connected you to me,

40:36.476 --> 40:38.808
which is why
you've been having
all these symptoms.

40:41.481 --> 40:42.766
Oh.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.308
I thought, uh...

40:50.198 --> 40:51.187
Well,

40:52.408 --> 40:54.399
good news is that
we can turn it off.

40:55.495 --> 40:56.735
Yeah.

40:57.914 --> 41:00.121
You know we can't stay
connected forever.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.783
Life is going to change
for me pretty quickly.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.372
And it's changing for you.

41:17.517 --> 41:18.677
But,
(BEEPS)

41:21.020 --> 41:25.184
I think you should, you know,
go be with Tess right now.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.818
You sure?

41:35.326 --> 41:37.703
Yeah, well, you know,
right after you rub my feet.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.365
(LAUGHING)

41:41.916 --> 41:42.905
Ow!

41:43.042 --> 41:43.997
I'll do it nice,
I'll do it nice.

41:44.127 --> 41:45.708
Gentle.
Iwill, Iwill.

41:50.466 --> 41:51.581
Hey.

41:55.680 --> 41:59.639
Well, well, well.
You seem awfully happy.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.974
I feel like
I lost 10 pounds.
How are you feeling?

42:02.103 --> 42:05.641
Well, actually,
I was hoping to go to
that asteroid event tonight.

42:06.024 --> 42:09.892
Well, it doesn't
happen that often
and it's pretty special.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.149
Well...

42:15.074 --> 42:19.033
If you'd like,
maybe we could
watch it together.

42:22.582 --> 42:25.619
You know,
I never got to thank
you for saving my life.

42:25.752 --> 42:27.617
Well, Manly did that.

42:27.754 --> 42:30.996
I meant in the elevator.
That was some kiss.

42:32.633 --> 42:33.964
That was CPR.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.887
So is this.

42:47.607 --> 42:49.063
That's not CPR.

42:49.192 --> 42:51.103
No, you're right,
but maybe we should

42:51.235 --> 42:53.521
try it again
just to be sure.

42:54.489 --> 42:58.357
(STAMMERS) Yeah,
I just tend not to
do that in public.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.404
Maybe you should start.
