00:03.496 --> 00:05.370
Hey!

00:05.549 --> 00:07.427
Come here. Welcome back.

00:07.428 --> 00:08.395
Thank you.

00:08.396 --> 00:09.529
- Here, this one's fresh.
- Thanks.

00:09.530 --> 00:11.298
- Oh, look at you.
- Oh, I had a corner, so...

00:11.299 --> 00:12.566
No, he's lying. I had the corner.

00:12.567 --> 00:14.067
It's fine. I had a huge breakfast.

00:14.068 --> 00:15.368
Come on, we want to see

00:15.369 --> 00:16.570
more pictures of Joanna.

00:16.571 --> 00:18.004
I've sent you so many already.

00:18.005 --> 00:19.206
But since you asked...

00:19.207 --> 00:21.007
Oh, here, I'll hold your coffee.

00:21.008 --> 00:22.809
Thank you.

00:22.810 --> 00:24.845
Wow, a lot of changes since I was gone.

00:24.846 --> 00:26.113
Congratulations, boss.

00:26.114 --> 00:29.182
Don't be ridiculous.
Blake is still the boss.

00:29.183 --> 00:30.884
Is Kat Sandoval here?

00:30.885 --> 00:32.786
Oh, she's in California
wrapping up her exit strategy

00:32.787 --> 00:34.788
from the avocado farm.
She'll be here next week.

00:34.789 --> 00:35.722
But we like her?

00:35.723 --> 00:37.424
I mean, I've heard some things.

00:37.425 --> 00:38.558
She meditates now.

00:38.559 --> 00:40.360
I get it. I breastfeed now.

00:40.361 --> 00:42.796
Oh, fun fact: when your body
detects warmer temperature,

00:42.797 --> 00:44.598
it'll change the content
of your breast milk

00:44.599 --> 00:46.266
to provide more hydration for your baby.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.535
I don't know how I know
that. Wow, that is a cute kid.

00:48.536 --> 00:49.536
Oh!

00:49.537 --> 00:50.737
Oh!

00:50.738 --> 00:52.038
Oh, look at those eyes.

00:52.039 --> 00:53.273
You are in so much trouble.

00:53.274 --> 00:54.741
I know, right?

00:54.742 --> 00:59.356
I could do this all day, but we
have a Women Transform the World

00:59.357 --> 01:00.418
- conference to plan.
- Yes.

01:00.419 --> 01:01.890
- Yes.
- And it ain't gonna plan itself.

01:01.891 --> 01:03.350
Oh! That's how I know that.

01:03.351 --> 01:04.650
Listen, you.

01:04.652 --> 01:06.433
As glad as I am

01:06.434 --> 01:08.301
to have you back, I want to remind you

01:08.302 --> 01:10.103
you still have a week
left on your maternity.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.572
I really wanted to be here
for the women's conference.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.360
Something about having
a little woman of my own

01:14.361 --> 01:15.694
made it even more important.

01:15.695 --> 01:17.696
But it is weird being
away from my daughter

01:17.697 --> 01:19.932
so I can make the world
better for my daughter.

01:19.933 --> 01:21.600
Still working on that balance.

01:21.601 --> 01:24.436
Well, that's what grandparents are for.

01:24.437 --> 01:25.904
Have Joe's parents seen Joanna?

01:25.905 --> 01:28.474
I haven't actually told them yet.

01:28.475 --> 01:29.842
Oh.

01:29.843 --> 01:30.839
I'm not avoiding it.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.841
I just got superstitious
when I was pregnant.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.115
I mean, I kept thinking this
poor woman just lost her son.

01:35.116 --> 01:36.711
What if something happens to this baby?

01:36.712 --> 01:37.812
How horrible will that be?

01:37.813 --> 01:39.014
Then, since Joanna was born,

01:39.015 --> 01:41.483
I've been completely
overwhelmed, but I will call.

01:41.484 --> 01:42.517
- Today.
- Good.

01:42.518 --> 01:43.918
As soon as I get a minute.

01:43.919 --> 01:46.721
And a caffeine rush, which
I will totally pump and dump.

01:46.722 --> 01:48.490
Let me know when I'm over-sharing.

01:48.491 --> 01:50.291
I've been alone with
a baby for a long time.

01:50.292 --> 01:52.861
As a rule, just pull back
when you feel yourself

01:52.862 --> 01:56.498
wanting to share color
or texture of anything.

01:56.499 --> 01:57.699
Thanks, ma'am.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.367
Sorry, you're being
summoned to the Sit Room.

01:59.368 --> 02:01.369
All right. Tell Jay
to start the meeting.

02:01.370 --> 02:02.804
Yeah.

02:02.805 --> 02:05.006
Operation Tiger Claw

02:05.007 --> 02:06.641
launches in four days, General.

02:06.642 --> 02:08.743
Is that sufficient time
to finish preparations?

02:08.744 --> 02:10.245
Ample time, Mr. President.

02:10.246 --> 02:12.180
Marines, Army, including Special Forces,

02:12.181 --> 02:15.083
as well as several British
and Canadian battalions

02:15.084 --> 02:16.584
are readying as we speak.

02:16.585 --> 02:17.852
What about air support?

02:17.853 --> 02:19.320
Taliban forces

02:19.321 --> 02:20.922
are concentrated in Baghlan Province,

02:20.923 --> 02:22.323
just outside Kabul.

02:22.324 --> 02:25.827
Air strikes could put the Afghan
civilians at a greater risk.

02:25.828 --> 02:27.362
While boots on the ground

02:27.363 --> 02:30.432
almost certainly means
more American casualties.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.500
Despite these concerns,

02:32.501 --> 02:34.969
we're confident this is the
best and most decisive way

02:34.970 --> 02:36.538
to decapitate the Taliban leadership.

02:36.539 --> 02:38.540
And send a clear message to Russia.

02:38.541 --> 02:42.610
Propping up the Taliban
in an effort to destabilize

02:42.611 --> 02:45.447
the Afghan central government
won't be tolerated anymore.

02:45.448 --> 02:49.484
Which is why, despite our
significant show of force,

02:49.485 --> 02:53.855
we will be following the Afghan
army's lead here, General.

02:53.856 --> 02:55.723
In the end, it's their fight.

02:55.724 --> 02:57.192
None of this will matter

02:57.193 --> 02:58.693
if we don't also lay the groundwork

02:58.694 --> 03:02.063
for a credible and
effective Afghan government.

03:02.064 --> 03:04.099
I mean, that is, if our end goal

03:04.100 --> 03:06.601
is still to withdraw
U.S. troops completely.

03:06.602 --> 03:09.270
That is our goal, of course.

03:09.271 --> 03:13.373
And a decisive blow would
help us achieve just that.

03:14.776 --> 03:15.977
General Mackey.

03:15.978 --> 03:18.675
Operation Tiger Claw could
take a significant bite

03:18.676 --> 03:19.886
out of the Taliban's control,

03:19.887 --> 03:21.883
while simultaneously setting the stage

03:21.884 --> 03:24.518
for lasting stability in Afghanistan.

03:26.221 --> 03:27.422
Right.

03:27.423 --> 03:29.823
Let's get it done.

03:32.760 --> 03:36.863
Peace through strength.
It's the party line.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.935
Give me some good news, people.

03:40.936 --> 03:43.071
Molly's returned from maternity leave.

03:43.072 --> 03:44.005
Molly, hey.

03:44.006 --> 03:46.007
Welcome back. We missed you.

03:46.008 --> 03:47.509
It's good to be back, Dr. McCord.

03:47.510 --> 03:49.344
The guys were just about to catch me up.

03:49.345 --> 03:51.312
So Senator Beau
Carpenter is behind bars.

03:51.313 --> 03:52.981
His replacement has been fully vetted,

03:52.982 --> 03:55.049
so our immediate intel leak is over.

03:55.050 --> 03:56.751
If only we had anything worth bringing

03:56.752 --> 03:58.274
to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

03:58.275 --> 03:59.254
Okay, look.

03:59.255 --> 04:01.589
Operation Tiger Claw
launches in four days.

04:01.590 --> 04:03.892
Our job is to collect
as much intel as possible

04:03.893 --> 04:05.602
on Russian and Taliban activities.

04:05.603 --> 04:07.840
The problem is our most
promising Russian assets

04:07.841 --> 04:09.148
in the region have gone to ground.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.916
They got spooked when
Osip Bakunin was murdered.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.885
Not Matvey Sokolov.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.153
Oh, that's your old friend

04:14.154 --> 04:16.411
from the Russian
Military Academy, right?

04:16.411 --> 04:17.423
Mm-hmm.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.425
Uh...

04:19.426 --> 04:20.593
Yeah, his profile is perfect.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.596
GRU spy working as a
liaison to the Taliban.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.030
Yeah, when I knew him,

04:25.031 --> 04:27.032
Matvey had deep ideological
issues with Russia

04:27.033 --> 04:28.901
and the way we meddled
in foreign governments,

04:28.902 --> 04:31.103
particularly Afghanistan.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.305
Plus, he's a sucker
for anything Western.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.007
He used to wear Van Halen T-shirts

04:35.008 --> 04:36.175
under his combat uniform.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.811
Dylan, you've been
running point on this.

04:38.812 --> 04:39.879
What's your impression?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.013
That he's not reliable.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.548
His information about leadership changes

04:42.549 --> 04:43.949
in the Taliban were solid,

04:43.950 --> 04:46.502
and he did tell you that there
were more where that came from.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.965
But every time I try to close the deal,

04:47.966 --> 04:49.138
he asks for something different.

04:49.139 --> 04:50.306
I can't get him over the finish line.

04:50.307 --> 04:51.707
We could try something else.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.510
Stop offering him things and
put a little pressure on him.

04:54.511 --> 04:57.013
Tell him he's running out
of time to be useful to us.

04:57.014 --> 04:59.849
Or... I could talk to him.

04:59.850 --> 05:01.717
Doesn't he believe

05:01.718 --> 05:03.019
Dmitri Petrov is dead?

05:03.020 --> 05:04.787
And what better way to convince a man

05:04.788 --> 05:06.656
that the United States
government can be trusted

05:06.657 --> 05:09.325
than to reveal that they
rescued me from the gulag

05:09.326 --> 05:11.327
and saved my life?

05:11.328 --> 05:13.062
When I knew him, America was his dream.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.530
And what if he has a new dream?

05:14.531 --> 05:17.004
You could wind up back in
witness protection or worse.

05:17.005 --> 05:19.469
I do not believe he would burn me.

05:19.470 --> 05:21.537
M-Matvey Sokolov is a Russian spy

05:21.538 --> 05:22.939
who is embedded with the Taliban.

05:22.940 --> 05:25.775
I have to at least try to
convince him to work with us.

05:25.776 --> 05:27.310
It's a huge risk.

05:27.311 --> 05:28.578
And you have taught me, sir,

05:28.579 --> 05:30.379
that those are the
only ones worth taking.

05:33.383 --> 05:34.817
Okay.

05:34.818 --> 05:38.421
Get in touch with Sokolov,
tell him I want to meet.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.722
We'll leave for Kabul tonight.

05:47.959 --> 05:49.799
_

05:52.936 --> 05:57.386
_

05:57.387 --> 05:59.309
_

06:03.751 --> 06:05.631
_

06:05.815 --> 06:07.383
So I was looking at my speech

06:07.384 --> 06:08.938
from last year's women's conference,

06:08.939 --> 06:10.153
you know, checking for ideas...

06:10.154 --> 06:12.577
And by "checking for ideas,"
you mean you hope to reuse

06:12.578 --> 06:13.745
last year's speech.

06:13.746 --> 06:15.180
No.

06:15.181 --> 06:17.949
Well, I don't want to say
that parts of it are timeless,

06:17.950 --> 06:20.518
but that would not
be totally inaccurate.

06:20.519 --> 06:22.887
Except the demographics have changed.

06:22.888 --> 06:25.557
We have a 20% uptick in
attendance in women under 30,

06:25.558 --> 06:28.727
who seem to think equal pay
for equal work is a fine idea.

06:28.728 --> 06:31.329
Man, I'm glad you're back.

06:31.330 --> 06:33.865
Okay, let's just spitball these ideas,

06:33.866 --> 06:35.300
and we'll write my speech.

06:35.301 --> 06:36.416
Help you?

06:36.417 --> 06:38.735
I have a press briefing to
give, e-mails to catch up on,

06:38.736 --> 06:40.505
and breasts to pump.
How about you help me?

06:40.506 --> 06:42.574
Okay.

06:42.575 --> 06:44.309
Just so you know, I'm leaving because

06:44.310 --> 06:45.844
you want to get rid of me,

06:45.845 --> 06:48.046
not because I'm afraid
of breast-pumping.

06:48.047 --> 06:49.781
Whatever works.

06:49.782 --> 06:52.583
Just a friend thing.

06:54.319 --> 06:56.354
How are your parents handling this?

06:56.355 --> 07:00.158
It's gonna take some time,
but they'll come around.

07:00.159 --> 07:02.694
Well, if you're looking
for some extended family,

07:02.695 --> 07:04.029
I'd like to offer up mine.

07:04.030 --> 07:07.232
As you know, I'm half
Irish, half Pakistani,

07:07.233 --> 07:10.468
so it's a lot of whiplash
in the lifestyle department.

07:10.469 --> 07:12.771
You got drinkers and teetotalers,

07:12.772 --> 07:14.706
carnivores, vegetarians,

07:14.707 --> 07:17.242
shouters and... well, everybody shouts.

07:17.243 --> 07:18.777
But in a fun way.

07:18.778 --> 07:20.778
And they all love babies.

07:21.713 --> 07:23.848
Okay, I wanted to strangle you

07:23.849 --> 07:25.417
a minute ago,

07:25.418 --> 07:28.353
now I feel all weepy.

07:28.354 --> 07:29.854
Damn hormones.

07:29.855 --> 07:33.425
Think about it. Open invitation.

07:33.426 --> 07:36.059
Everybody needs family.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.074

08:01.586 --> 08:05.223
Hello? Is this Mrs. Garcia?

08:05.224 --> 08:06.991
My name is Daisy Grant.

08:06.992 --> 08:09.461
You don't know me, but I knew your son.

08:09.462 --> 08:11.930
I knew Joe.

08:11.931 --> 08:14.232
Ma'am, I'm so sorry to bother you here.

08:14.233 --> 08:17.368
No, no, no, I just had to get my 30...

08:17.369 --> 08:18.636
25 minutes in.

08:18.637 --> 08:20.371
I could hear my Fitbit screaming at me

08:20.372 --> 08:23.641
from whatever drawer I shoved it in.

08:23.642 --> 08:25.610
How's your first day back going?

08:25.611 --> 08:27.846
Fine. Great.

08:27.847 --> 08:32.049
I mean, I miss her, but...
I'm talking to adults,

08:32.051 --> 08:33.885
I'm using my brain, and
I'm so happy to be back

08:33.885 --> 08:36.121
for the women's conference,
because, as we discussed,

08:36.121 --> 08:37.355
the fact that I have a daughter now

08:37.356 --> 08:39.090
makes all of these issues
even more important.

08:39.091 --> 08:41.126
So I don't at all
regret at all coming back

08:41.126 --> 08:43.044
- from maternity leave early.
- Good.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.496
Because, you know, it's
a privilege to have a job

08:44.497 --> 08:45.930
where there is maternity leave.

08:45.931 --> 08:48.433
But the thing is,

08:48.434 --> 08:50.502
I finally talked to Joe's mother.

08:50.503 --> 08:52.804
And she was so happy to hear from me,

08:52.805 --> 08:55.039
and she really wants to meet Joanna.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.875
And I feel like I can't say no to her

08:56.876 --> 08:59.878
because I'm the one who
contacted her out of the blue.

08:59.879 --> 09:02.914
And they live in Connecticut,
which is, like, a long drive.

09:02.915 --> 09:04.816
So, you know, the whole
thing is gonna be a lot,

09:04.817 --> 09:07.218
and I know that I just got back,

09:07.219 --> 09:09.920
but I need to ask for a day off.

09:12.991 --> 09:14.791
Daisy...

09:16.928 --> 09:18.663
...take two days off.

09:18.664 --> 09:20.765
Really?

09:20.766 --> 09:22.734
Take as many days as you need.

09:22.735 --> 09:25.136
Oh, God, I feel like I'm gonna cry.

09:25.137 --> 09:28.573
Yeah, you're gonna have to
get used to that feeling.

09:31.709 --> 09:33.978
I'm just saying,

09:33.979 --> 09:38.783
Afghanistan, 72 hours before

09:38.784 --> 09:42.220
a massive U.S. military operation.

09:42.221 --> 09:45.123
I mean, if you need an adrenaline rush,

09:45.124 --> 09:47.025
why don't you just, I don't know,

09:47.026 --> 09:49.761
stay home and take up race car driving?

09:49.762 --> 09:51.830
Our troops are about to go toe to toe

09:51.831 --> 09:53.464
against the Taliban rebels.

09:53.465 --> 09:54.933
Don't you think it'd be a good idea

09:54.934 --> 09:57.302
to have as much on-the-ground
intel as possible?

09:57.303 --> 10:00.170
Could I have that green one, please?

10:02.040 --> 10:04.008
Are you really confident
that Alexander can

10:04.009 --> 10:06.845
get this Russian operative to talk?

10:06.846 --> 10:08.513
Well, if his old friend
is who he says he is,

10:08.514 --> 10:12.450
I'll come back with information
about Taliban troop movements

10:12.451 --> 10:14.719
that could prove invaluable.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.156
Okay, literally, all I could make out

10:18.157 --> 10:21.359
from that sentence were
the words "I'll come back".

10:21.360 --> 10:23.795
Everything else just sounded
like Charlie Brown's teacher.

10:23.796 --> 10:26.731
What do you want me to do, babe?

10:26.732 --> 10:31.703
Please say it again... and mean it.

10:31.704 --> 10:35.539
I'll come back. I promise.

10:37.408 --> 10:39.377
In the meantime, why don't you look into

10:39.378 --> 10:42.245
that race car driving thing?

10:57.781 --> 11:04.177
Subtitle sync and corrections by

11:09.015 --> 11:10.584
You okay?

11:10.585 --> 11:13.420
I was just thinking...

11:13.421 --> 11:16.523
if I had never gone to War College or...

11:16.524 --> 11:19.326
or met you, if I had stayed
in the Russian military

11:19.327 --> 11:22.062
and been a good soldier...

11:22.063 --> 11:23.797
then this is where I'd be now.

11:23.798 --> 11:26.066
Helping to prop up an armed insurgency

11:26.067 --> 11:28.568
and destabilize the elected government.

11:28.569 --> 11:30.070
Let's just hope that Matvey Sokolov

11:30.071 --> 11:32.539
is as cynical as you are
about Russia's intentions here.

11:32.540 --> 11:36.543
I have faith Matvey has
remained an idealist.

11:36.544 --> 11:40.979
And if not, then, yeah, I'm
sure he still loves money.

11:57.864 --> 11:59.065
Daisy!

11:59.066 --> 12:01.701
Mrs. Garcia.

12:01.702 --> 12:04.470
Oh, please, call me Margarita.

12:05.538 --> 12:08.408
Oh, my God.

12:08.409 --> 12:11.177
She looks just like him.

12:11.178 --> 12:12.979
Yes, you know that?

12:12.980 --> 12:14.481
You look like your daddy.

12:15.650 --> 12:18.650
Oh, I'm so happy to
meet you. Come on in.

12:22.956 --> 12:25.058
Dr. McCord, I was told

12:25.059 --> 12:26.626
you would be coming alone.

12:26.627 --> 12:29.094
I brought an old friend to see you.

12:32.032 --> 12:33.816
Dim?

12:33.817 --> 12:35.177
_

12:37.838 --> 12:40.012
_

12:40.513 --> 12:41.801
_

12:44.399 --> 12:46.025
_

12:46.977 --> 12:48.257
_

12:48.899 --> 12:50.901
_

12:51.553 --> 12:52.888
_

12:52.919 --> 12:54.653
Mm-hmm.

12:55.388 --> 12:57.524
We speak English now, okay?

12:57.525 --> 12:58.925
Ah.

12:58.926 --> 13:00.527
Down to business.

13:00.528 --> 13:02.529
I'm afraid we don't have much time.

13:02.530 --> 13:04.963
Our friend is not safe here.

13:08.902 --> 13:14.040
The GRU knows that Dalton is
launching a military operation.

13:14.041 --> 13:16.609
They have card up their sleeve.

13:16.610 --> 13:18.812
We need details.

13:20.548 --> 13:23.316
Isn't that always the way?

13:23.317 --> 13:25.785
If you help us, we can offer you cash

13:25.786 --> 13:27.353
and asylum in the United States.

13:27.354 --> 13:30.190
You will finally be free.

13:33.893 --> 13:37.263
You came all this way,
put yourself in harm's way

13:37.264 --> 13:39.998
to convince me to help the Americans?

13:40.700 --> 13:43.503
I love my adopted country, Matvey.

13:43.504 --> 13:47.639
I promise you, it is
everything we imagined and more.

13:52.112 --> 13:54.914
And the delegate from Bulgaria
suggested a mentoring program on...

13:54.915 --> 13:56.649
Ma'am.

13:56.650 --> 13:59.384
Amina Salah, the Afghanistan
Minister of Education.

14:01.087 --> 14:04.324
- Elizabeth. Oh...
- Ah, it's so good to see you.

14:04.325 --> 14:05.658
Jay.

14:05.659 --> 14:07.861
I hear you've been promoted.

14:07.862 --> 14:10.797
- I couldn't seem to talk her out of it.
- Oh, he tried.

14:10.798 --> 14:11.898
I'm really looking forward

14:11.899 --> 14:13.366
to your keynote address, Minister.

14:13.367 --> 14:14.968
Excuse me.

14:14.969 --> 14:16.202
Come on, sit down.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.153
I want to hear about
the kids and everything.

14:18.154 --> 14:19.053
Oh, yes.

14:20.841 --> 14:24.644
You know, I spend my life
fighting for girls' education,

14:24.645 --> 14:27.847
and Saba wants to take a
gap year before university.

14:27.848 --> 14:30.016
That's not so bad.

14:30.017 --> 14:32.952
Stevie took time off from
school, and she's fine.

14:32.953 --> 14:34.921
How are the wedding plans?

14:34.922 --> 14:36.723
Not happening.

14:36.724 --> 14:38.691
Details are unclear.

14:38.692 --> 14:40.794
- I'm sorry.
- Well...

14:40.795 --> 14:42.729
she's bouncing back.

14:42.730 --> 14:45.165
I hear her giggling on the phone.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.766
Oh, who knows.

14:46.767 --> 14:48.835
Life goes on after a heartache.

14:48.836 --> 14:50.970
It's a good lesson for all of us.

14:50.971 --> 14:53.907
I recognize the theme
from your keynote address.

14:53.908 --> 14:56.509
- So you saw the draft?
- Yeah.

14:56.510 --> 14:58.945
It's not too provocative?

14:58.946 --> 15:01.080
The world needs to be provoked.

15:01.081 --> 15:03.249
Yes.

15:03.250 --> 15:07.719
Well... better with words
than with drone strikes.

15:08.488 --> 15:11.491
I want to assure you that...

15:11.492 --> 15:13.960
this military operation is being planned

15:13.961 --> 15:16.062
down to the smallest detail.

15:16.063 --> 15:17.697
Every precaution

15:17.698 --> 15:21.801
is being taken to avoid
any civilian casualties.

15:21.802 --> 15:23.670
I am sure.

15:25.005 --> 15:27.140
If there were a diplomatic solution,

15:27.141 --> 15:28.875
believe me, I-I would...

15:28.876 --> 15:30.510
It is hard to negotiate

15:30.511 --> 15:34.147
when 68% of the country
wants Sharia law.

15:34.148 --> 15:36.216
68? Wow.

15:36.217 --> 15:37.383
The problem is,

15:37.384 --> 15:39.786
too many people do not remember

15:39.787 --> 15:41.855
what it was like before.

15:41.856 --> 15:45.124
My mother wore short skirts.

15:45.125 --> 15:47.193
She went out, she danced,

15:47.194 --> 15:49.596
she served on her school board.

15:49.597 --> 15:52.465
I know you've... heard
it too many times before,

15:52.466 --> 15:55.034
but... we hope this action

15:55.035 --> 15:57.637
will help bring real
stability this time.

15:57.638 --> 16:00.139
If we can just give them a taste

16:00.140 --> 16:03.076
of the Afghanistan that my mother knew.

16:03.077 --> 16:06.679
Or even moderate Islamic rule.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.214
But these days...

16:08.215 --> 16:10.316
...that can be a contradiction in terms.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.986
Ma'am. Sorry. You're urgently
needed in the Sit Room.

16:12.987 --> 16:15.722
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:15.723 --> 16:18.623
- Oh, I hate to cut this short.
- Of course.

16:19.459 --> 16:21.261
Thank you for having me here.

16:23.030 --> 16:25.297
It's an honor, Amina.

16:27.867 --> 16:30.094
According to Matvey
Sokolov, the Russians have

16:30.095 --> 16:32.564
a Taliban loyalist
embedded in the Afghan army.

16:32.565 --> 16:35.934
General Nawroz Arezou.

16:35.935 --> 16:38.636
He's a decorated and respected
leader in the Afghan army.

16:38.637 --> 16:41.072
But once we launch Operation Tiger Claw,

16:41.073 --> 16:43.908
he plans to order his
troops to stand down.

16:43.909 --> 16:46.311
Why would they be loyal to
him and not their country?

16:46.312 --> 16:48.012
He's a strong leader, he's charismatic,

16:48.013 --> 16:50.048
and most of the men under his command

16:50.049 --> 16:52.417
come from villages that
are loyal to the Taliban.

16:52.418 --> 16:55.320
How many men does Arezou have under him?

16:55.321 --> 16:58.156
Uh... 30,000.

16:58.157 --> 17:00.492
That's 20% of the Afghan forces.

17:00.493 --> 17:04.194
Without General Arezou's
troops on the field,

17:04.195 --> 17:07.732
Afghanistan has no hope
of rooting out the Taliban.

17:07.733 --> 17:08.833
We'll lose this battle.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.901
Along with more American lives.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.321
Good day, President Sharza.

17:18.323 --> 17:21.500
Please tell me you have news
concerning General Arezou.

17:21.501 --> 17:23.702
Arezou was arrested at his residence,

17:23.703 --> 17:26.598
and I've already placed
General Piruz Hashmi

17:26.598 --> 17:28.266
in charge of his command.

17:28.267 --> 17:32.137
You are confident that he can
take charge of Arezou's troops?

17:32.138 --> 17:34.806
I have full confidence
in Hashmi's loyalty,

17:34.807 --> 17:36.308
and it will be as if this, uh,

17:36.309 --> 17:38.209
terrible interruption never happened.

17:38.210 --> 17:40.125
I appreciate your positive report,

17:40.126 --> 17:41.173
President Sharza.

17:41.174 --> 17:42.975
We'll, uh, be in touch.

17:42.976 --> 17:45.242
Of course, Mr. President.

17:48.281 --> 17:50.549
I feel like he's trying
to raise the price

17:50.550 --> 17:52.684
on something I don't even want to buy.

17:52.685 --> 17:56.488
I have to admit that my
confidence in this mission

17:56.489 --> 17:57.990
has been shaken.

17:57.991 --> 17:59.858
Before we proceed,

17:59.859 --> 18:02.361
we should at least know
how the Taliban turned

18:02.362 --> 18:05.297
one of the top generals in
the Afghan central government.

18:05.298 --> 18:07.933
And if there are any other
traitors in their midst.

18:07.934 --> 18:09.968
I agree.

18:09.969 --> 18:12.337
Which means, Bess...

18:12.338 --> 18:13.872
I know.

18:13.873 --> 18:16.173
Henry's staying in Afghanistan.

18:17.709 --> 18:19.711
One of the hardest
things about Joe's death

18:19.712 --> 18:22.547
was knowing that he would
never get to have children,

18:22.548 --> 18:25.817
that I would never get to see
his face in my grandchildren.

18:25.818 --> 18:28.120
So when I got your call,

18:28.121 --> 18:30.322
it felt like a miracle.

18:30.323 --> 18:33.492
Though I admit, for a fraction
of a second I was worried

18:33.493 --> 18:36.261
you might turn out to be
some kind of scam artist.

18:36.262 --> 18:38.297
You know, one of those people

18:38.298 --> 18:40.933
who prey on widows for their money.

18:40.934 --> 18:42.301
I totally understand.

18:42.302 --> 18:44.536
I mean, you're a woman alone...
you can't be too careful.

18:44.537 --> 18:47.940
And then I remembered...
you loony old woman,

18:47.941 --> 18:49.975
you don't have any money!

18:51.811 --> 18:54.279
Anyway, the minute I saw Joanna,

18:54.280 --> 18:57.048
I knew she was his.

18:58.150 --> 19:00.519
Joe was so handsome, wasn't he?

19:00.520 --> 19:01.787
Yes.

19:01.788 --> 19:04.089
He got his looks from his father.

19:04.090 --> 19:05.724
He died when Joe was young.

19:05.725 --> 19:07.326
Did he tell you?

19:07.327 --> 19:10.729
Well, he didn't... say exactly how old.

19:10.730 --> 19:12.631
Just three.

19:12.632 --> 19:15.267
Dan was in the military,
Persian Gulf War.

19:15.268 --> 19:18.236
He was killed by friendly fire.

19:18.237 --> 19:21.038
Such... bad luck.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.843
Would you like to see a picture of him?

19:24.844 --> 19:27.245
Of course.

19:31.616 --> 19:33.284
Hi.

19:37.389 --> 19:41.159
If you expect me to bow down
to the great United States,

19:41.160 --> 19:42.728
you will be disappointed.

19:42.729 --> 19:44.129
The United States?

19:44.130 --> 19:46.365
General, you betrayed your own country.

19:46.366 --> 19:49.201
No. I was honoring
the will of my people.

19:49.202 --> 19:52.938
They are sick of weak and
corrupt central government.

19:52.939 --> 19:55.140
No more Western puppets.

19:55.141 --> 19:57.475
The people want Islamic law.

19:59.111 --> 20:01.747
And who reached out to you?

20:01.748 --> 20:03.015
The Taliban leadership?

20:03.016 --> 20:04.549
What does it matter?

20:04.550 --> 20:06.918
In the Baghlan Province,
the Taliban are everywhere.

20:06.919 --> 20:09.187
They're our neighbors and friends.

20:09.188 --> 20:10.589
We have tea together.

20:10.590 --> 20:12.657
What did your friends offer you

20:12.658 --> 20:14.626
to drop your guns for them?

20:16.863 --> 20:19.097
You think I can be bought.

20:19.098 --> 20:21.199
Of course you do.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.502
Because where you come
from, everyone and everything

20:23.503 --> 20:24.936
is for sale.

20:24.937 --> 20:26.671
I see you have daughters, General.

20:26.672 --> 20:30.208
What do you think it'll be
like for them under the Taliban?

20:30.209 --> 20:32.377
No more school, no more freedom,

20:32.378 --> 20:34.080
an arranged marriage when they're 16...

20:34.081 --> 20:35.087
You are mistaken.

20:35.088 --> 20:37.682
My daughters will go to school,

20:37.683 --> 20:39.717
and then to work.

20:41.053 --> 20:43.321
General, we both know the Taliban

20:43.322 --> 20:45.390
will never allow that to happen.

20:45.391 --> 20:48.026
They already have.

20:48.027 --> 20:51.096
Yet again, the U.S.
is leading from behind.

20:51.097 --> 20:53.698
But now you are so far back,

20:53.699 --> 20:57.335
you can't even see which
direction the world is headed.

20:57.336 --> 20:59.604
He actually said that?

20:59.605 --> 21:01.406
The Taliban will educate his daughters?

21:01.407 --> 21:04.109
And let them work. It's
not your mommy's Taliban.

21:04.110 --> 21:07.179
Henry, if they're
offering these concessions,

21:07.180 --> 21:08.880
it could completely change

21:08.881 --> 21:12.451
the political calculus in Afghanistan.

21:12.452 --> 21:14.252
We need to know if Arezou

21:14.253 --> 21:16.688
- is on the level.
- At the risk of being reminded

21:16.689 --> 21:19.357
that the U.S. does not
negotiate with terrorists,

21:19.358 --> 21:20.926
I'm gonna throw out a name.

21:20.927 --> 21:23.061
Akbar Haq Raquib.

21:23.062 --> 21:24.796
The Taliban foreign minister.

21:24.797 --> 21:26.498
He wanted to defect.

21:26.499 --> 21:28.600
But when he turned us down,
he stayed with the group.

21:28.601 --> 21:30.769
He could absolutely
confirm Arezou's story.

21:30.770 --> 21:33.170
Back channel with the Taliban.

21:34.372 --> 21:36.575
I mean, is Dalton gonna think I'm crazy

21:36.576 --> 21:38.777
just for even suggesting it?

21:38.778 --> 21:40.312
To my way of thinking,

21:40.313 --> 21:43.315
a peaceful solution is worth
sounding a little crazy.

21:43.316 --> 21:45.317
When are you coming home?

21:45.318 --> 21:47.184
I'm leaving right now, babe.

21:57.395 --> 21:58.597
Okay.

21:58.598 --> 22:02.334
"Ava in a Kia Soul will
be here in one minute."

22:02.335 --> 22:05.137
I guess I better use my time wisely.

22:05.138 --> 22:06.938
- Very smooth.
- Aw...

22:14.012 --> 22:17.349
Hey, um, not a big deal,

22:17.350 --> 22:19.251
but are you ever going
to tell me where you were

22:19.252 --> 22:20.784
for the past couple of days?

22:22.454 --> 22:26.324
It's just... we've never talked about

22:26.325 --> 22:28.860
whether we're seeing other people.

22:28.861 --> 22:29.995
Are you seeing other people?

22:29.996 --> 22:32.764
Yes, I'm...

22:32.765 --> 22:34.199
I'm seeing your father.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.834
I was at a conference with him...

22:35.835 --> 22:37.335
- Stop.
- ...the other night.

22:37.336 --> 22:40.038
I never believed that stuff
about working together.

22:40.039 --> 22:42.140
Oh...

22:42.141 --> 22:43.475
Hey...

22:43.476 --> 22:45.309
That looks ridiculous.

22:47.345 --> 22:50.482
Aw, I wish it wasn't a school night.

22:50.483 --> 22:51.883
Wait, school? I...

22:51.884 --> 22:55.020
I thought you were
working at the White House.

22:55.021 --> 22:56.821
I will explain it to you tomorrow night.

22:56.822 --> 22:58.356
- We're still on, right?
- Yes.

22:58.357 --> 22:59.991
My sister's working... I checked twice.

22:59.992 --> 23:01.726
And I will cook for you.

23:01.727 --> 23:04.829
Should I be scared?

23:04.830 --> 23:06.831
Not of the food.

23:06.832 --> 23:08.600
Okay. Good night.

23:08.601 --> 23:09.868
- Will you send me that picture?
- Mm-hmm.

23:09.869 --> 23:11.535
Okay.

24:06.370 --> 24:09.207
Uh, Henry, we've got a problem.

24:09.208 --> 24:11.156
Matvey Sokolov's extraction team says

24:11.157 --> 24:13.125
he didn't show at the
rendezvous point today.

24:13.126 --> 24:14.993
Agents waited for 20 minutes

24:14.994 --> 24:17.229
before taking off without him.

24:17.230 --> 24:18.696
I was afraid of this.

24:19.731 --> 24:22.501
His intelligence was good,
he wanted to come to the U.S.

24:22.502 --> 24:25.871
He wouldn't turn me in to the Russians.

24:25.872 --> 24:27.471
At least not willingly.

24:29.508 --> 24:31.476
Okay, call the Kabul
office and have them send

24:31.477 --> 24:33.678
a fire team to Matvey's apartment.

24:34.913 --> 24:36.048
Is there something else?

24:36.049 --> 24:37.149
No, sir.

24:37.150 --> 24:38.883
I'll get on the phone with Kabul.

24:43.322 --> 24:46.191
Amina, we received intelligence

24:46.192 --> 24:50.963
indicating the Taliban might
be open to peaceful negotiations

24:50.964 --> 24:53.966
in exchange for a seat
in your government.

24:53.967 --> 24:57.469
President Sharza asked if
NATO and the United States

24:57.470 --> 24:59.237
might be open to talks.

24:59.238 --> 25:02.741
The United States is going
to negotiate with the Taliban?

25:02.742 --> 25:05.677
Back-channel communications
between Sharza's administration

25:05.678 --> 25:07.980
and members of the Taliban have begun.

25:11.116 --> 25:14.853
I realize this must
sound like a compromise.

25:14.854 --> 25:18.090
"Compromise" is not
the word I would choose.

25:18.091 --> 25:20.292
I understand.

25:20.293 --> 25:24.562
At least 68% of my
country will welcome this.

25:25.731 --> 25:27.599
Most of whom probably have no idea

25:27.600 --> 25:29.401
that they are giving up democracy,

25:29.402 --> 25:34.740
personal freedom and, of
course, women's rights.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.908
And they won't miss these things

25:36.909 --> 25:38.310
because they've never had them,

25:38.311 --> 25:40.544
and now they never will.

25:42.247 --> 25:45.651
You mentioned the possibility
of a moderate Islamic state.

25:45.652 --> 25:48.086
The whole reason these
talks are happening

25:48.087 --> 25:51.289
is because we learned there's
a faction of the Taliban

25:51.290 --> 25:53.325
that is open to education.

25:53.326 --> 25:55.360
But do you know the kind
of education they mean?

25:55.361 --> 25:59.564
Girls swaying over the Qur'an in burkas

25:59.565 --> 26:02.534
for ten hours a day while a
male teacher instructs them

26:02.535 --> 26:04.136
from behind a curtain.

26:04.137 --> 26:07.239
We'll negotiate for a real education.

26:07.240 --> 26:11.777
The Soviets. Pakistan. The Taliban.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.345
Now the United States.

26:15.947 --> 26:18.216
Every "new solution" is hardest

26:18.217 --> 26:22.320
on the one group that has
the least power already.

26:22.321 --> 26:24.256
They took more and more away from us

26:24.257 --> 26:27.693
until we were literally
under house arrest.

26:27.694 --> 26:30.796
- Mutilated for going out alone...
- I know.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.431
You can't possibly.

26:32.432 --> 26:36.301
What I do know is that
open societies where women

26:36.302 --> 26:39.638
and the disenfranchised
have fundamental rights

26:39.639 --> 26:41.540
mean a better life for everyone.

26:41.541 --> 26:44.810
It is what I fight for every day, Amina.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.612
But it doesn't come from guns,

26:47.613 --> 26:49.514
and it doesn't come from drone strikes.

26:49.515 --> 26:51.983
It comes, as you said, from words.

26:51.984 --> 26:55.854
We have an opportunity to talk,

26:55.855 --> 26:58.090
and I think it's good
that we're taking it.

26:58.091 --> 27:01.359
You know what would give me hope?

27:01.360 --> 27:04.429
If a woman, one woman,
was in those talks.

27:04.430 --> 27:07.599
Because she would understand
better than anyone else

27:07.600 --> 27:11.636
what the price of peace should be.

27:11.637 --> 27:14.805
We have paid it so many times.

27:18.210 --> 27:19.845
Matvey and his girlfriend,

27:19.846 --> 27:21.546
or maybe just some woman

27:21.547 --> 27:23.148
on the worst date of her life,

27:23.149 --> 27:24.883
were shot in his apartment.

27:24.884 --> 27:28.053
ME at the scene estimated
they'd been dead 12 hours.

27:28.054 --> 27:30.322
Must have gotten to them
within hours of our meeting.

27:30.323 --> 27:32.324
I had been communicating
with him for months.

27:32.325 --> 27:34.659
They could have been on to
him by the time you got there.

27:34.660 --> 27:37.129
They were tortured.

27:37.130 --> 27:39.965
They found a car battery and electrodes

27:39.966 --> 27:41.867
next to their bodies.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.902
Poor girl, she didn't have any intel.

27:43.903 --> 27:45.670
She was just in the wrong place

27:45.671 --> 27:47.405
at the wrong time when the
Russians kicked the door in.

27:47.406 --> 27:50.207
Alexander, can I talk to you a minute?

27:53.345 --> 27:55.046
Listen, if you need to
take the rest of the day...

27:55.047 --> 27:58.517
No. I mean, I'm fine, thank you.

27:58.518 --> 28:02.988
But there is something you need to know.

28:02.989 --> 28:05.122
I was followed last night.

28:07.526 --> 28:08.994
Why didn't you mention this sooner?

28:08.995 --> 28:11.329
At the time, I hoped I
was just being paranoid,

28:11.330 --> 28:15.367
but... if-if Matvey was tortured,

28:15.368 --> 28:18.402
and if he gave me up...

28:20.539 --> 28:23.608
Um, I've got the license
plate number of the car.

28:23.609 --> 28:26.044
Okay, get it for me. I'll run it.

28:26.045 --> 28:28.419
You're absolutely certain
this information is correct?

28:28.420 --> 28:31.416
Henry's office reached out
to their asset in Kabul,

28:31.417 --> 28:34.286
who's connected to Akbar Haq Raquib,

28:34.287 --> 28:39.391
and he confirmed... the
Taliban want to negotiate.

28:39.392 --> 28:42.327
So just like that,
Operation Tiger Claw morphs

28:42.328 --> 28:45.030
from a military offensive
against the Taliban

28:45.031 --> 28:46.765
to... peace talks?

28:46.766 --> 28:49.319
Maybe the Taliban are
as weary of fighting

28:49.320 --> 28:50.587
as everyone else.

28:50.588 --> 28:53.789
In exchange for peace, I
assume they have a few demands?

28:56.125 --> 28:58.561
They want a role in
the central government.

28:58.562 --> 29:01.731
It's a compromise that
has worked in the past.

29:01.732 --> 29:04.634
In Ireland and South Africa.

29:04.635 --> 29:06.936
Say what you will about their methods,

29:06.937 --> 29:10.273
the Taliban aren't global jihadists.

29:10.274 --> 29:12.183
They could be satisfied with a voice

29:12.184 --> 29:14.352
in their country's leadership.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.354
Yes, but what about the people

29:16.355 --> 29:17.822
they're ostensibly leading?

29:17.823 --> 29:19.958
After all this time, we
can't just open the door

29:19.959 --> 29:22.627
and invite the enemy in
without a popular consensus.

29:22.628 --> 29:24.429
A recent human rights poll found

29:24.430 --> 29:27.666
that approximately 68% of
the country favor Sharia law.

29:27.667 --> 29:31.169
I-I know. I was surprised, too.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.538
The Afghan people have
been living with a chaotic,

29:33.539 --> 29:37.242
weak and corrupt government
for so long that, uh,

29:37.243 --> 29:39.778
the Taliban is starting
to look good by comparison.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.780
Well, if that's so, sir,

29:41.781 --> 29:44.115
then maybe it's time for us to finally

29:44.116 --> 29:45.649
get off the merry-go-round.

29:47.519 --> 29:50.188
Walk me through it, Bess.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.123
The Taliban would agree

29:52.124 --> 29:54.859
to recognize a democratically
elected government,

29:54.860 --> 29:58.630
of which they would be
an active minority party.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.932
Women would have access to education,

30:00.933 --> 30:04.436
and the ability to work, but not drive.

30:04.437 --> 30:06.838
So we're talking strict Islamic law

30:06.839 --> 30:08.273
as oppose to Sharia?

30:08.274 --> 30:09.674
That's something.

30:09.675 --> 30:11.743
It is.

30:11.744 --> 30:14.813
There's one hard line
in the sand for them:

30:14.814 --> 30:16.548
no women running for office

30:16.549 --> 30:18.649
or serving in the new government.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.624
And we were doing so well.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.626
Kind of puts the lie to their request

30:28.627 --> 30:30.261
for free elections, doesn't it?

30:30.262 --> 30:32.397
Look, I'm not happy about it, either,

30:32.398 --> 30:34.966
but other countries have
declared independence

30:34.967 --> 30:37.302
and labeled themselves free

30:37.303 --> 30:39.938
while neglecting to give
their female citizens

30:39.939 --> 30:41.973
an equal voice.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.875
This country we're
standing in, for instance.

30:43.876 --> 30:46.077
A mistake that was eventually corrected.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.212
And I have every hope

30:47.213 --> 30:49.914
that Afghanistan will do the same.

30:49.915 --> 30:51.381
Eventually.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.393
Gather the NSC.

31:01.394 --> 31:02.761
I want all opinions on the floor

31:02.762 --> 31:04.785
- for discussion.
- Yes, sir.

31:10.028 --> 31:14.031
All right... all right.

31:14.032 --> 31:17.767
Most of the decisions
that get made in this room

31:17.768 --> 31:19.435
are difficult.

31:19.436 --> 31:21.371
This one is no exception,

31:21.372 --> 31:24.607
so... let's go one at a time, hmm?

31:24.608 --> 31:26.109
Mr. President.

31:26.110 --> 31:27.715
This is our chance

31:27.716 --> 31:30.251
to strike a significant
blow against the Taliban.

31:30.252 --> 31:32.420
Why would we stand down
and make concessions

31:32.421 --> 31:33.888
when we're winning?

31:33.889 --> 31:34.989
Are we winning?

31:34.990 --> 31:37.659
It doesn't always feel like that to me.

31:37.660 --> 31:39.827
All due respect, sir,

31:39.828 --> 31:42.163
I agree with Gordon. It's premature

31:42.164 --> 31:44.032
to consider negotiating
with the Taliban.

31:44.033 --> 31:47.201
"Premature" after almost
two decades of war?

31:47.202 --> 31:49.737
We need to use military force

31:49.738 --> 31:52.340
so we can create the
political leverage we need

31:52.341 --> 31:54.475
for a sustainable political solution.

31:54.476 --> 31:56.611
And how many other armies

31:56.612 --> 32:00.229
have made that same calculation
only to wind up mired for years?

32:00.230 --> 32:02.122
And what if the people of Afghanistan

32:02.123 --> 32:04.124
have identified a
solution for themselves?

32:04.125 --> 32:06.026
Two-thirds of them favor Taliban rule.

32:06.027 --> 32:09.229
Or have we not yet evolved from
telling the rest of the world

32:09.230 --> 32:11.815
- how to run their lives?
- I understand that you swim

32:11.816 --> 32:14.652
in a vast universe of gray
area, Russell, but there are

32:14.653 --> 32:16.854
some of us that can still see a clear

32:16.855 --> 32:19.657
and distinct line between
what's right and what's wrong.

32:19.658 --> 32:22.192
Well, now you're just
trying to hurt my feelings.

32:22.193 --> 32:23.594
Madam Secretary,

32:23.595 --> 32:25.462
you can't possibly favor a plan that,

32:25.463 --> 32:27.498
if it was implemented
here, would have you

32:27.499 --> 32:29.800
cleaning out your desk.

32:29.801 --> 32:31.602
Oh, and that is assuming

32:31.603 --> 32:34.471
there was a man willing
to chauffeur you home.

32:34.472 --> 32:37.308
Even the Saudis came to their senses

32:37.309 --> 32:40.210
and agreed to let women
drive, for God's sake.

32:40.211 --> 32:43.047
That's a concession I
hope we can still win.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.949
But they are holding the line

32:44.950 --> 32:47.418
on keeping women out
of the new government.

32:47.419 --> 32:49.286
It is "take it or leave it."

32:49.287 --> 32:50.821
And you're encouraging us

32:50.822 --> 32:52.022
to take it.

32:52.023 --> 32:54.558
I'm trying to... not lose sight

32:54.559 --> 32:57.595
of the compromises the
Taliban has already made.

32:57.596 --> 32:59.463
Ones that would have been unthinkable

32:59.464 --> 33:01.764
a decade ago.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.669
Women's education and employment

33:05.670 --> 33:08.639
coupled with a strong
democratic government

33:08.640 --> 33:13.076
can be the seeds that grow
a more progressive society.

33:13.777 --> 33:16.180
They have to start somewhere.

33:16.181 --> 33:18.882
And what do we tell
our Gold Star families?

33:18.883 --> 33:21.251
The ones who have made
the real sacrifices.

33:21.252 --> 33:23.520
"Sorry, but the insurgents
that killed your child,

33:23.521 --> 33:25.856
"they're gonna be running
things in Afghanistan now.

33:25.857 --> 33:27.257
Thanks for your service."

33:27.258 --> 33:29.026
Sir...

33:29.027 --> 33:30.794
it is my recommendation that we proceed

33:30.795 --> 33:32.863
with Operation Tiger Claw as planned.

33:32.864 --> 33:34.898
Taking the diplomatic path now

33:34.899 --> 33:36.567
will only lead

33:36.568 --> 33:38.802
to Afghanistan returning to the haven

33:38.803 --> 33:40.804
for terrorists that it was in 2001.

33:40.805 --> 33:42.139
We'll be right back

33:42.140 --> 33:43.974
where we started, sir... on a decline

33:43.975 --> 33:46.275
to theocracy and despotism.

33:49.446 --> 33:51.748
Thank you all for your input.

33:52.449 --> 33:54.784
I'll let you know my decision.

34:04.762 --> 34:07.630
We don't have to agree on this one.

34:09.967 --> 34:12.469
Look, I get it.

34:12.469 --> 34:14.538
You helped plan this operation,

34:14.539 --> 34:17.141
and you have faith in
what it can accomplish.

34:17.141 --> 34:19.443
I'm not blinded by the bars, Elizabeth.

34:21.179 --> 34:24.148
Doesn't it strike you as ironic,

34:24.149 --> 34:27.551
the two of us in this building talking

34:27.552 --> 34:30.154
about a historic decision

34:30.155 --> 34:33.056
that could deny a generation of women

34:33.058 --> 34:35.292
this same opportunity?

34:35.293 --> 34:37.761
Of course I can appreciate that.

34:37.762 --> 34:40.697
And I also appreciate
that we are both thinking

34:40.699 --> 34:42.764
about the greater good.

34:43.766 --> 34:47.771
Where you see a tiny
window to negotiate...

34:47.772 --> 34:50.674
I see a wedge...

34:50.675 --> 34:53.476
where we can finally pry open the door

34:53.478 --> 34:55.911
and liberate half a country.

34:58.182 --> 35:00.651
That's me...

35:00.652 --> 35:03.820
thinking about the greater good.

35:07.257 --> 35:08.659
Henry.

35:08.660 --> 35:10.561
Thanks for coming by.

35:10.562 --> 35:12.429
Your assistant said it was urgent.

35:12.430 --> 35:17.201
Yeah. I got word that you
are running a license plate.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.136
Yeah. Alexander Mehranov

35:19.137 --> 35:21.205
thought he was being
followed last night.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.207
We were concerned it was the Russians.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.809
He was being followed,
but not by the Russians.

35:28.212 --> 35:31.215
It was CIA, Security Division.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.851
It's standard operating
procedure when an agent

35:33.852 --> 35:36.552
completes a stint in rehab.

35:38.155 --> 35:41.225
I should have been informed
you were surveilling my agent.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.894
Fair point.

35:43.895 --> 35:48.297
So did they see any suspicious behavior?

35:49.333 --> 35:52.503
This is the work Mehranov
signed up for, Henry.

35:52.504 --> 35:55.706
The United States government
is completely within its rights

35:55.707 --> 35:59.109
to keep an eye on agents who
could present a security risk.

35:59.110 --> 36:01.612
I assure you Alexander's not a risk.

36:01.613 --> 36:04.748
And his work on
Afghanistan is essential.

36:04.749 --> 36:06.549
Understood.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.386
I'll call off the dogs.

36:09.387 --> 36:12.122
But let me know if anything changes.

36:12.123 --> 36:14.258
And I mean anything.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.293
Is there anything else?

36:16.294 --> 36:17.895
No.

36:17.896 --> 36:19.762
Thanks.

36:20.531 --> 36:21.998
Mm-hmm.

36:39.750 --> 36:42.286
Okay...

36:42.287 --> 36:44.388
I did pick up pierogi...

36:44.389 --> 36:46.423
and I do know that "pierogi" is plural,

36:46.424 --> 36:49.193
so there's no "S"...
but I got a lot of them,

36:49.194 --> 36:51.895
and it's not because I don't
think you can cook, it's...

36:51.896 --> 36:53.230
I've just never had them,

36:53.231 --> 36:55.365
and-and they made me
think of you, so...

36:55.366 --> 36:56.867
I-I still haven't...

36:56.868 --> 36:58.869
- haven't made anything...
- Well, perfect.

36:58.870 --> 37:01.470
I got meat and potato.

37:04.975 --> 37:06.109
Hi.

37:06.110 --> 37:07.610
Hi.

37:08.345 --> 37:09.313
Can, um...

37:09.314 --> 37:11.281
can-can we sit down for a minute?

37:11.282 --> 37:12.950
Can I talk to you?

37:12.951 --> 37:14.184
Yeah.

37:14.185 --> 37:17.086
I was actually about
to say the same thing.

37:24.995 --> 37:27.463
Why don't you go first?

37:28.632 --> 37:30.599
Okay. Um...

37:32.269 --> 37:35.339
All right. I don't
think I realized, um...

37:35.340 --> 37:37.207
how bad I was feeling about myself

37:37.208 --> 37:39.610
after the breakup with Jareth.

37:39.611 --> 37:41.979
But...

37:41.980 --> 37:44.014
with you, I, um...

37:44.015 --> 37:46.550
I feel like myself again.

37:46.551 --> 37:49.887
So... whatever this is or isn't,

37:49.888 --> 37:52.189
or-or... will be,

37:52.190 --> 37:55.125
I just wanted...

37:55.126 --> 37:58.194
I just wanted to thank you.

37:59.730 --> 38:01.297
Okay.

38:02.032 --> 38:03.966
Your turn.

38:07.938 --> 38:10.206
It can wait.

38:28.625 --> 38:30.093
Is it time?

38:30.094 --> 38:32.062
No. We still have a few minutes.

38:32.063 --> 38:33.597
But I have some news.

38:33.598 --> 38:35.299
I'm afraid to ask.

38:35.300 --> 38:37.401
President Sharza accepted

38:37.402 --> 38:39.736
the terms offered by the Taliban,

38:39.737 --> 38:42.239
and the U.S. has backed the deal.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.840
The military operation

38:43.841 --> 38:47.476
is officially off the table for now.

38:48.779 --> 38:51.648
And how soon before
you pull your troops out

38:51.649 --> 38:53.383
and leave us to our fate?

38:53.384 --> 38:56.086
There's a three-year plan
to make sure that the Taliban

38:56.087 --> 38:58.155
hold up their end of the agreement.

38:58.156 --> 39:00.157
We won't leave if they don't.

39:00.158 --> 39:01.992
You'll have a revised constitution

39:01.993 --> 39:04.294
of moderate Islamic rule.

39:04.295 --> 39:06.697
Women will still be educated,

39:06.698 --> 39:10.000
they can work, vote,
control their own finances,

39:10.001 --> 39:13.070
but there is one point
we couldn't move them on.

39:13.071 --> 39:16.506
Women will not be able to
hold government positions.

39:16.507 --> 39:18.941
At least... not yet.

39:22.647 --> 39:24.547
Of course.

39:25.248 --> 39:26.717
It's a place to start.

39:26.718 --> 39:28.552
Please don't sell me on this right now.

39:28.553 --> 39:31.588
I suppose this is my last speech

39:31.589 --> 39:34.391
as Minister of Education.

39:34.392 --> 39:36.526
Uh, excuse me, Madam Secretary.

39:36.527 --> 39:38.461
We're ready for you.

39:39.463 --> 39:43.066
And now, to introduce
our keynote speaker,

39:43.067 --> 39:45.602
we bring you a very special guest

39:45.603 --> 39:49.506
and an inspiration to women everywhere.

39:49.507 --> 39:53.176
Please welcome to the Women
Transform the World conference,

39:53.177 --> 39:55.545
Secretary of State

39:55.546 --> 39:57.913
Elizabeth McCord.

40:01.786 --> 40:04.888
That's you, Madam Secretary.

40:04.889 --> 40:07.189
Go.

40:23.106 --> 40:26.943
I meet a lot of survivors in my work,

40:26.944 --> 40:29.646
people who have seen some of the worst

40:29.647 --> 40:32.516
this world has to offer,

40:32.517 --> 40:34.684
and the quality they all share

40:34.685 --> 40:37.788
is the ability to
believe in the coming day

40:37.789 --> 40:40.991
even in the bleakest dawn.

40:40.992 --> 40:46.329
Amina Salah has seen many
bleak new dawns in her country,

40:46.330 --> 40:49.066
through a violent revolution,

40:49.067 --> 40:52.002
communism, Soviet occupation

40:52.003 --> 40:54.471
and a brutal civil war.

40:54.472 --> 40:56.506
She had an opportunity to escape

40:56.507 --> 40:59.209
before the Taliban came to power,

40:59.210 --> 41:01.611
but she stayed, earning a bachelor's

41:01.612 --> 41:03.680
and then a law degree

41:03.681 --> 41:05.282
from Kabul University.

41:06.751 --> 41:11.088
And as she watched a generation
of girls denied access

41:11.089 --> 41:14.591
to a basic education,
Amina dedicated her life

41:14.592 --> 41:17.761
to giving them the same
opportunity she had.

41:17.762 --> 41:19.262
In her tenure

41:19.263 --> 41:21.865
as Afghanistan's Minister of Education,

41:21.866 --> 41:24.601
she's worked tirelessly to give faith

41:24.602 --> 41:27.537
to a new generation of girls

41:27.538 --> 41:30.373
that a new day is coming,

41:30.374 --> 41:34.644
one that may feel bleak and cold now,

41:34.645 --> 41:37.881
but will one day be warm and broad

41:37.882 --> 41:41.483
and include everyone under the sun.

41:42.252 --> 41:44.054
I'm reminded of a quote

41:44.055 --> 41:46.656
from one of our own
keepers of the faith,

41:46.657 --> 41:49.226
Susan B. Anthony.

41:49.227 --> 41:50.861
"We shall someday be heeded,

41:50.862 --> 41:54.164
"and everybody will
think it was always so,

41:54.165 --> 41:56.700
"just exactly as many young people today

41:56.701 --> 42:01.138
"think all the privileges
which woman now possesses

42:01.139 --> 42:03.373
"always were hers.

42:03.374 --> 42:05.542
"They have no idea

42:05.543 --> 42:10.847
"how every single inch
of ground she stands on

42:10.848 --> 42:13.483
"has been gained by the hard work

42:13.484 --> 42:18.722
of some little handful
of women in the past."

42:18.723 --> 42:21.391
Or, in our case, the present.

42:21.392 --> 42:25.128
Please welcome Afghan
Minister of Education

42:25.129 --> 42:28.261
and my dear friend, Amina Salah.
