The new emperor,

His father, Vespasian,
was loved by his people,

that love for his son.

Indeed.

a question for you.

28:40.011 --> 28:41.221
On my journey from the harbor,

28:41.304 --> 28:42.584
I noticed some of your townsfolk

No. Nothing of the sort.

28:59.989 --> 29:01.533
But our new construction

29:01.616 --> 29:04.244

with a new aqueduct,

Do you think we can
do business with him?

He wouldn't be here if the
