01:35.560 --> 01:38.790
General, the Princess' convoy
has entered our realm.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.490
Prepare to receive them.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.730
Prepare to receive them!

02:26.710 --> 02:30.610
General Meng Yi of Qin

02:30.680 --> 02:32.240
welcomes Your Highness.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.720
May it please Her Highness.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.540
May it please Her Highness.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.890
His Imperial Majesty decrees -

02:52.940 --> 02:57.240
<i>Princess Ok Soo shall be Concubine Li of Qin,</i>

02:57.310 --> 03:00.610
<i>for our nations' mutual concord.</i>

03:00.940 --> 03:03.240
<i>Princess Ok Soo is so commanded.</i>

03:31.910 --> 03:35.610
My orders are to bring back Princess Ok Soo.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.850
Whoever interferes shall die!

03:41.920 --> 03:44.180
Her Royal Highness is now Concubine Li of Qin.

03:44.250 --> 03:47.880
Whoever dares is an enemy of our state!

03:50.090 --> 03:54.760
They leave us no alternative.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.700
Prepare to attack.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.830
Prepare to attack!

04:01.100 --> 04:02.200
Ready defenses.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.140
Ready defenses.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.740
Hurry! Protect the Princess!

04:45.950 --> 04:47.310
Hurry! Away from this place!

07:21.000 --> 07:24.100
Come back with me, Princess.

07:24.370 --> 07:26.500
You are already my betrothed.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.340
I cannot go back with you.

07:31.380 --> 07:34.580
I cannot abide you
marrying the moribund emperor.

07:37.050 --> 07:39.250
It's a surrender of our sovereignty to Qin!

07:39.890 --> 07:43.120
I was forced into this decision.
Please understand.

07:43.860 --> 07:48.020
You are a general!
How can you besmirch my honor?

08:18.490 --> 08:19.620
Come!

08:21.130 --> 08:23.430
My mission is to protect the Princess.

08:28.470 --> 08:32.530
Draw. Let's both fulfill our missions.

09:32.430 --> 09:34.370
Protect the Princess.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.200
Save her!

09:45.510 --> 09:46.710
Run!

09:54.160 --> 09:55.560
Your Highness!

10:38.830 --> 10:42.070
28 Feb 2005.

10:42.140 --> 10:46.100
I had the same dream from months ago.

10:46.180 --> 10:50.240
This time... I'm an ancient general,

10:51.710 --> 10:53.810
leading a vast army to rescue...

10:55.520 --> 11:00.390
some sort of princess.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.120
I fell off a cliff...

11:10.170 --> 11:12.660
William? You're back in Hong Kong?

11:12.740 --> 11:14.200
Great! Come on over!

11:21.410 --> 11:24.350
Talk about being all at sea!

11:24.410 --> 11:25.540
How come you live on a barge?

11:25.610 --> 11:28.410
The research budget was halved last year.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.110
With the project unfinished,

11:30.820 --> 11:32.880
I had to sell the flat.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.350
So I moved here with my study.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.160
It's not so bad! Pretty roomy here.

11:39.130 --> 11:42.360
So why are you back suddenly?
Didn't like the States?

11:42.430 --> 11:45.200
I came to solve your financial problems.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.590
Can I?

11:50.470 --> 11:52.170
I want you to do something for me.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.670
<i>Hi William!
This must be Dr Chan.</i>

11:57.180 --> 11:58.440
Just call me Jack.

11:58.710 --> 12:02.170
<i>I'm Maggie.
Welcome to our Anti-Gravity Research Project.</i>

12:03.220 --> 12:04.310
Anti-Gravity?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.620
This is my lab.
Check it out.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.750
<i>Let's ask Dr Smith to give
a little demonstration.</i>

12:10.830 --> 12:12.290
<i>Doctor, please.</i>

12:18.230 --> 12:23.300
<i>It's a well-known fact that spinning
an object at increased speed</i>

12:23.470 --> 12:25.270
<i>can reduce its weight,</i>

12:25.340 --> 12:27.740
<i>and we can already show the results.</i>

12:29.510 --> 12:31.600
<i>These are very expensive experiments.</i>

12:31.680 --> 12:33.410
<i>Quite impractical,</i>

12:33.480 --> 12:36.250
<i>and unusable on living subjects,</i>

12:36.920 --> 12:40.510
<i>as no living creature can survive such speed.</i>

12:40.690 --> 12:42.320
Thank you, Maggie.

12:42.490 --> 12:43.920
<i>You're welcome.</i>

12:45.460 --> 12:47.690
I don't understand.
You're a physicist,

12:47.760 --> 12:49.860
I'm an archaeologist.
How can I help you?

12:50.730 --> 12:54.290
I’m seeking a breakthrough in the
field of mysterious phenomena...

12:54.640 --> 12:55.970
...in a paper you wrote.

12:57.640 --> 13:01.670
Over 2000 years ago
there was a tiny kingdom south of Dasar,

13:01.740 --> 13:04.470
whose king became immortal after death.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.880
His coffin floated in mid-air.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.720
Your paper inspired me.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.790
It's just a myth.

13:11.850 --> 13:14.220
I can even lend you comic books about this.

13:14.290 --> 13:17.660
Lots of things are called myths
prior to empirical verification.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.890
Hey, Jack...

13:20.300 --> 13:22.790
Wireless telephony was a myth 150 years ago.

13:22.870 --> 13:26.560
So was the airplane, and landing on the moon!

13:26.640 --> 13:28.360
Even 50 years ago,

13:28.440 --> 13:31.240
computer and digital technology were a myth.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.240
Many people are competing
to develop this technology.

13:34.310 --> 13:37.840
If I succeed, I'll change human history...

13:37.910 --> 13:40.940
This technology could be vital to our lives,

13:41.020 --> 13:42.510
to surface and air transportation,

13:42.580 --> 13:45.520
even inter-galactic travel!

13:48.290 --> 13:51.590
I know you've always wanted
to do something great.

13:51.660 --> 13:53.990
No one's ever entered this ancient tomb before.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.960
But my work is archaeology,
and I have my ethic,

13:58.030 --> 14:00.760
I do research, not raid tombs.

14:08.010 --> 14:11.470
You still can't forget that
incident after all these years?

14:12.310 --> 14:15.280
Something you'll never forget.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.590
We haven't played for ages.

14:22.660 --> 14:24.490
How's your game?

14:27.060 --> 14:28.360
Jack.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.300
Don't you practice anymore?

14:35.370 --> 14:37.740
Sure! I just never shot from this angle before.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.400
So why shoot?

14:39.470 --> 14:40.870
Because you passed it to me.

14:40.940 --> 14:42.500
Don't worry about it. Come on.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.310
That Maggie is your girlfriend?

14:45.380 --> 14:48.610
No. She represents my sponsor.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.650
By the way, what happened to Monica?

14:50.720 --> 14:52.780
Monica? Forget her.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.550
I've been dreaming about a princess.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.350
Her name's Ok Soo.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.520
I called out her name in my sleep.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.760
How do you think Monica took it?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.690
Now back to business.
Jack,

15:06.770 --> 15:08.600
you've never been a stickler for rules.

15:08.670 --> 15:10.900
You've always trusted your instincts.

15:10.970 --> 15:15.030
Instincts helped you unravel
the Dead Sea Scrolls forgery...

15:15.310 --> 15:16.640
Jack, hey...

15:17.010 --> 15:18.480
Jack!

15:23.090 --> 15:26.890
Jack, do as your instincts tell you.

15:26.990 --> 15:31.620
I want to prove it's not a myth,
but something real.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.340
You're my best friend.

15:42.740 --> 15:45.570
I trust you won't let me face danger alone.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.400
Ever tried hitting a golf shot like this?

16:25.750 --> 16:27.150
Jack!

16:27.520 --> 16:28.510
What's with you?

16:28.550 --> 16:30.040
I think I've got heat stroke.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.710
Almost there. Come on!

16:31.790 --> 16:33.880
Don't lie to me now.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.720
You should exercise more regularly.

16:36.790 --> 16:39.560
I do! 3 hours of golf each day,

16:39.630 --> 16:41.460
2 hours of tennis...

16:41.530 --> 16:43.730
And another dozen hours
a day playing video games,

16:43.800 --> 16:45.430
you'll go blind in no time.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.560
If you're so fit why don't you carry me?

16:47.640 --> 16:49.000
You can walk.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.430
Hurry up. We won't get in if we're late!

16:59.010 --> 17:01.950
Jack, that's the holy man who can fly?

17:02.020 --> 17:04.579
Yes. Let's go over there.

17:08.619 --> 17:10.450
He really can fly...

17:20.069 --> 17:21.869
Get up. Follow me.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.099
Hey, up, up.

17:27.810 --> 17:29.240
-Hurry.
-Give me a hand.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.950
Grab hold of my leg!

17:33.720 --> 17:35.580
-You've got strong legs.
-Let go!

17:38.850 --> 17:40.690
Wow! Nice stone carvings!

17:40.860 --> 17:42.760
You have no idea how many stories they tell.

17:42.820 --> 17:45.520
I didn't come this far on my last expedition.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.570
Jack!

18:18.190 --> 18:19.590
The stone coffin's just floating there.

18:19.660 --> 18:20.960
Zoom in and see if it's suspended by wire.

18:21.030 --> 18:22.720
I’m working on it already.

18:24.800 --> 18:29.740
Jack, there's a sword beside the coffin.

18:29.970 --> 18:31.200
I can see it.

18:31.270 --> 18:35.730
I think the inscription records his deeds.

18:36.710 --> 18:39.200
Mission to Qin?

18:39.750 --> 18:44.010
<i>This prince once brought
treasures and women to Qin.</i>

18:44.090 --> 18:48.080
<i>The Qin Emperor gifted him one of his concubines,</i>

18:48.160 --> 18:52.860
<i>but he picked the Emperor’s favourite.</i>

18:52.930 --> 18:56.960
<i>The Emperor reneged and gave him
her painting instead,</i>

18:57.030 --> 19:00.970
<i>as well as the Qin Star Gem in apology.</i>

19:01.040 --> 19:06.940
The prince even fought a bout
with Qin's greatest warrior,

19:07.010 --> 19:09.030
and exchanged sword with him.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.880
-Hey! Don't!
-What?

19:30.200 --> 19:31.560
Jack!

19:32.300 --> 19:33.290
Are you all right?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.860
What did you just move?

19:36.810 --> 19:40.670
I've never seen stones like these.
I want some for research.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.840
I told you not to steal anything!

19:42.910 --> 19:45.180
I was going to return it afterwards.

19:45.650 --> 19:47.310
It almost costs me my life!

19:47.580 --> 19:51.990
How come the coffin fell
as soon as I pulled it out?

20:17.980 --> 20:19.140
<i>His Majesty commanded me...</i>

20:19.210 --> 20:22.880
<i>to paint a portrait of Concubine Li
as a gift to the Prince of Dasar.</i>

20:22.950 --> 20:24.680
She doesn't smile, how can I paint?

20:27.990 --> 20:31.150
I've not seen her smile since she arrived.

20:32.890 --> 20:35.160
<i>General Meng!</i>

20:56.990 --> 21:01.050
Excellent! That's the smile!

21:04.760 --> 21:06.250
Jack!

21:06.330 --> 21:07.800
Stop dreaming!

21:07.860 --> 21:10.390
I hear footsteps!

21:14.870 --> 21:15.860
Quick! Lift it up!

21:15.940 --> 21:17.430
Why don't you ask them to help?

21:37.260 --> 21:39.350
Jack! Help me!

21:50.440 --> 21:51.840
Hey! Let go!

23:04.410 --> 23:06.040
Who are you?

23:06.150 --> 23:08.340
Why come and desecrate our sacred temple?

23:08.420 --> 23:10.440
What do you gain by this?

23:16.520 --> 23:19.290
I just came in to look for something,

23:19.360 --> 23:21.950
I didn't mean to wreck the coffin,

23:22.030 --> 23:23.900
it was an accident.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.260
Sorry!

23:34.380 --> 23:35.360
Are you all right?

23:35.440 --> 23:37.380
I was apologizing.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.470
How was I to know? I was just trying to help.

23:39.550 --> 23:40.540
Let's go!

23:41.280 --> 23:42.770
Told you not to steal!

23:43.850 --> 23:45.550
It's for protection.

23:47.820 --> 23:49.310
Let's go Jack!

23:50.020 --> 23:51.390
Look, I took the painting for you as well.

23:51.460 --> 23:52.480
What?

24:00.370 --> 24:01.360
Run.

24:01.540 --> 24:02.970
Get them!

24:07.880 --> 24:08.870
Jack.

24:08.910 --> 24:10.170
Wait.

24:10.880 --> 24:11.970
Come on.

24:23.020 --> 24:25.220
Get up. Let's go.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.030
Get him, get them all!

24:44.550 --> 24:47.280
Jack! Didn't you say you had backup?

24:47.350 --> 24:49.150
All I see are monkeys!

24:54.690 --> 24:56.020
You get on board first.

25:02.430 --> 25:03.490
Jack!

25:05.570 --> 25:07.260
Pick up some stones!

25:16.210 --> 25:19.180
It is too dangerous, we have to leave now.

25:19.250 --> 25:20.480
Come on! Jack!

25:20.550 --> 25:22.040
-Fly a bit lower!
-No!

25:22.120 --> 25:24.240
We are hit! We must go.

25:25.220 --> 25:27.650
Come on up! Jack!

25:29.520 --> 25:30.720
Jack!

25:34.430 --> 25:35.690
Go and catch him!

26:22.340 --> 26:23.500
Thank God!

26:39.460 --> 26:40.760
Concubine Li!

26:43.770 --> 26:45.060
Concubine Li...

27:31.380 --> 27:34.710
Your Highness,
forgive my lapse in your protection.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.300
Halt!

27:59.340 --> 28:01.830
Lay down your sword, or I'll kill her.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.120
Don't!

28:11.750 --> 28:14.810
If only one can live, I'd rather it be you.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.720
Drop it!

28:38.450 --> 28:40.210
General!

28:52.790 --> 28:54.280
General Meng Yi!

28:54.360 --> 28:56.160
Don't help me...

28:56.230 --> 28:58.320
I'm beneath your station.

29:00.330 --> 29:03.270
Why do you risk your life for me?

29:04.810 --> 29:08.210
A blade is forged to drink the blood of enemies.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.180
I am like a blade,
destined to fight for His Majesty,

29:11.250 --> 29:13.210
and die for my country.

29:13.650 --> 29:17.310
You are now Concubine Li of Qin.
Protecting you is my duty.

29:17.450 --> 29:19.680
Your Highness has suffered a fright.

29:21.520 --> 29:25.820
With you beside me I'm not afraid of anything.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.760
We cannot stay here. We must leave quickly.

31:19.670 --> 31:22.640
Lakchume... don't be naughty.

31:23.680 --> 31:27.940
Good boy, good boy, Lakchume.

31:28.820 --> 31:32.480
Lakchume? Where are you going?

31:33.290 --> 31:35.920
Oh my god. It's a body.

31:35.990 --> 31:37.820
Lakchume, hurry up.

31:38.090 --> 31:39.990
Lakchume, pick up the body.

31:46.870 --> 31:48.860
Easy, easy...

31:49.540 --> 31:52.440
Be careful... be careful, good boy.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.140
How are you feeling now?

33:34.540 --> 33:36.010
Much better. Thank you.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.470
How did I get here?

33:37.550 --> 33:41.500
You were injured very badly,
the flow of the river brought you here.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.980
-Where's my...
-Sword?

33:45.050 --> 33:47.040
Come with me. This way.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.780
What is this place?

33:50.860 --> 33:53.490
This is the birthplace of the Dasar martial arts.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.860
It has a history of 3,000 years.

33:57.470 --> 34:01.200
My uncle, he is a master of the 275th generation.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.160
There he is.

34:27.230 --> 34:30.199
I heard you made the news in Dasar.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.929
I am so sorry to have caused so much trouble.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.130
You wrecked the coffin of a Dasar King!

34:38.139 --> 34:42.770
But you also broke the
2,000-year-old myth of Dasar.

34:43.679 --> 34:49.010
For generations now,
the locals don't understand spiritual training.

34:49.550 --> 34:56.650
All they understand is to genuflect
before those levitating holy men.

34:57.590 --> 35:00.530
Today they have learnt at least one thing -

35:01.160 --> 35:06.690
spiritual training is not about
raising your head and looking up.

35:07.570 --> 35:15.530
it is about lowering your head
and learn humility and honesty.

35:18.610 --> 35:22.640
Young man, I know why you came.

35:22.820 --> 35:25.050
This is no ordinary sword.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.610
Is it yours?

35:32.130 --> 35:33.650
Guothum.

35:38.330 --> 35:40.770
The sword is not mine
and I didn't come to fight.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.570
I just came to find some answers

35:43.840 --> 35:46.270
Fight for your answers.

37:11.190 --> 37:14.820
Young man... young man

37:20.300 --> 37:23.960
Now do you have the answer in your heart?

37:25.670 --> 37:28.200
You can become one with your sword!

37:28.280 --> 37:32.180
It must be a bond from lifetimes ago.

37:32.250 --> 37:36.180
Master, do you really believe in past lives?

37:37.020 --> 37:42.460
Which life is a past life;
and which life is present life?

37:42.690 --> 37:46.060
What is an illusion, and what is real?

37:46.730 --> 37:49.920
I always dream of an ancient
general and a princess,

37:50.000 --> 37:53.160
I don't know if this has anything to do with me.

37:53.230 --> 37:57.000
And I don't even know if the things
in my dream really happened.

37:57.070 --> 38:00.770
Yesterday I saw the picture of
the princess inside a tomb.

38:00.840 --> 38:05.240
This is the first time my dream
was reflected in reality.

38:05.850 --> 38:08.780
Master, I am really confused.

38:08.850 --> 38:12.220
A dream may seem amazing and without reason,

38:12.290 --> 38:15.190
but it can explain reality.

38:15.490 --> 38:19.890
Dreams are made of your
imagination and creativity,

38:19.960 --> 38:23.260
and your memories of reality.

38:23.330 --> 38:29.130
That's why they seem so
imaginary and yet so real.

38:30.200 --> 38:34.730
Because you always dream of one person,

38:34.810 --> 38:37.240
it could be a sign that...

38:37.810 --> 38:44.720
the memories locked deep into
your heart are getting released.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.150
Memories?

38:49.220 --> 38:52.390
What should I do? Who is he?

38:52.530 --> 38:55.360
What is he trying to tell me?

38:56.100 --> 38:59.790
Only you can find the answer you need.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.000
Meng Yi...

40:05.870 --> 40:07.600
General Meng Yi!

40:16.140 --> 40:19.010
General, come in.

40:23.150 --> 40:24.620
Meng Yi...

40:34.830 --> 40:37.560
Meng Yi? General Meng Yi?

40:43.640 --> 40:47.630
You promised to protect me. You can't die!

40:48.880 --> 40:50.540
Meng Yi?

41:13.570 --> 41:19.130
Meng Yi? Meng Yi...

41:28.450 --> 41:32.510
I have nothing left in this world,

41:32.990 --> 41:35.220
not even a relative.

42:05.220 --> 42:07.550
Please don't abandon me!

42:08.490 --> 42:12.120
I have nothing left but you.

42:13.090 --> 42:15.650
Please don't leave me alone!

43:09.520 --> 43:14.010
General Meng Yi. Over here quickly.

43:21.260 --> 43:25.030
This is the first time I've felt so free.

43:25.300 --> 43:27.700
No courtly rites and regulations.

43:28.100 --> 43:30.300
What a beautiful feeling!

43:30.570 --> 43:33.000
This is the first time
I've seen Your Highness smile.

43:35.610 --> 43:37.240
Why don't you look at me?

43:37.310 --> 43:38.610
Your humble servant does not dare.

43:41.420 --> 43:45.480
Don't say such things.
Don't take away this feeling...

43:45.820 --> 43:48.620
I'll stop calling you General.

43:49.120 --> 43:51.060
How's that, Meng Yi?

44:01.370 --> 44:04.240
I want to dance. Shall I dance for you?

44:04.770 --> 44:06.330
No, Your Highness. You mustn't.

44:06.410 --> 44:09.030
In this world,
only the Emperor himself may watch.

44:09.510 --> 44:12.670
This is a dance for you alone.

45:43.500 --> 45:45.400
Please, Your Highness.

46:13.230 --> 46:15.260
We have reached the Great Wall.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.170
This is entirely our realm.

46:18.640 --> 46:21.900
Our capital Xianyang is just over the hill.

46:22.780 --> 46:25.970
You are now safe, Concubine Li.

46:27.180 --> 46:30.510
I have accomplished my mission finally.

46:32.750 --> 46:36.210
No! I don't want to go to Xianyang.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.350
Take me away! Take me anywhere!

46:40.430 --> 46:42.830
I only want to be with you!

46:43.260 --> 46:45.360
I don't want to marry the Emperor!

47:03.850 --> 47:08.010
Why did we struggle to stay alive,

47:08.920 --> 47:12.220
just to become slaves to Destiny?

47:14.690 --> 47:19.720
When will we ever be free?

47:21.800 --> 47:24.360
Not until the day we die?

47:40.050 --> 47:41.990
Ok Soo... Concubine Li...

47:42.060 --> 47:43.780
Your Highness, please calm down.

47:43.860 --> 47:47.730
Don't forget your own mission.

47:47.790 --> 47:49.520
You must live for the sake of your people.

47:49.660 --> 47:52.660
Only with life is there hope.

47:53.700 --> 47:57.330
Promise me, you must live!

47:58.840 --> 48:02.540
You would have me live in such agony?

48:05.050 --> 48:08.880
Very well!

48:09.080 --> 48:10.880
I promise you!

48:14.520 --> 48:17.080
I'll live for you!

48:25.730 --> 48:26.890
Jack!

48:27.770 --> 48:30.630
The police are after you!

48:30.700 --> 48:32.400
-What?
-That's him!

48:32.740 --> 48:34.930
We have to get out of here.
Come here, come with me.

48:48.090 --> 48:49.390
Come with me, Jack!

49:58.730 --> 50:01.460
Put it down! Put it down!

50:01.860 --> 50:03.660
Oh my God! Let's go!

50:06.470 --> 50:07.630
This way.

50:22.820 --> 50:24.720
Why are you helping him?

50:25.050 --> 50:26.990
Did you help him to break into the temple?

50:27.520 --> 50:29.680
You! Freeze!

50:59.020 --> 51:00.180
Wow what?

51:00.250 --> 51:02.520
Wow means you are very good.

51:06.830 --> 51:07.950
This way, Jack!

52:21.030 --> 52:22.700
Don't jump! No!

52:22.770 --> 52:24.100
No what?

52:24.240 --> 52:25.670
Never mind.

53:04.940 --> 53:06.000
What are you doing?

53:06.110 --> 53:07.580
Helping you.

53:07.750 --> 53:08.740
Jack.

53:21.960 --> 53:23.050
Jack.

53:23.160 --> 53:24.860
Jack, help me!

53:30.170 --> 53:32.000
Jack, help me!

53:32.370 --> 53:34.000
Jack, help me.

53:40.880 --> 53:42.210
Give me your hands!

53:46.220 --> 53:47.210
Jump!

53:51.360 --> 53:52.380
Come on!

53:55.230 --> 53:56.220
Wait!

53:56.260 --> 53:57.320
What?

54:05.240 --> 54:06.800
Sorry.

54:07.910 --> 54:09.030
Let's go!

54:22.220 --> 54:25.820
Along the river for two days,
it will take you to China.

54:27.090 --> 54:28.650
Thank you so much.

54:29.330 --> 54:31.130
Will I ever see you again?

54:32.370 --> 54:35.770
I will definitely come back
to see you and your master.

54:37.700 --> 54:38.970
Take care.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.090
I’m levitating!

55:08.330 --> 55:13.700
We've examined it by every means
from spectroscope to MRI.

55:13.970 --> 55:16.700
What is unbelievable is...

55:16.780 --> 55:18.970
that its atomic spectra...

55:19.050 --> 55:22.450
didn't remotely match
any known material on Earth,

55:22.520 --> 55:26.010
including the spectra measured
by the Icarus Project.

55:26.250 --> 55:29.920
This particular spectra was
in one of the last transmissions,

55:29.960 --> 55:30.790
before the detector flew out of the solar system.

55:30.820 --> 55:32.980
Mid-air coffee break!

55:33.530 --> 55:38.050
However if the light emitted
from the stone gets blocked,

55:38.130 --> 55:40.500
it would be functionless.

55:42.100 --> 55:43.130
Maggie!

55:43.800 --> 55:45.030
Don't!

55:53.280 --> 55:54.370
Hello?

55:54.810 --> 55:58.150
Jack, our project has succeeded...

55:59.320 --> 56:00.810
Well, almost!

56:00.890 --> 56:03.320
What? It's a meteorite?

56:04.390 --> 56:06.050
From outside our Solar system?

56:06.130 --> 56:10.150
<i>That's right. We must now find the rest of them.</i>

56:10.960 --> 56:12.260
<i>Where's the painting from the coffin?</i>

56:12.830 --> 56:14.090
It's here with me.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.830
I’m going to Xian. Meet me there.

56:17.400 --> 56:19.200
Bring the painting with you.

56:20.040 --> 56:21.300
Good, bye for now.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.810
I’m coming with you.

56:59.950 --> 57:01.440
My initial assessment:

57:01.510 --> 57:05.950
It's forged around the Qin dynasty.

57:07.120 --> 57:09.050
The scale-like surface material

57:09.120 --> 57:11.890
is found only in Qin-dynasty artifacts.

57:11.960 --> 57:14.950
Looking at the design and decorations,

57:15.230 --> 57:18.820
I'd say it belonged to a Qin general.

57:18.900 --> 57:21.260
This is a national treasure!

57:22.840 --> 57:24.460
Be careful.

57:29.110 --> 57:31.580
What are you doing? The sword is ours!

57:31.840 --> 57:35.010
Jack has bequeathed it to our museum.

57:37.520 --> 57:40.650
Our foundation financed this project.

57:40.890 --> 57:42.950
Anything found should belong to the foundation.

57:43.020 --> 57:44.990
How can you donate the sword to the museum?

57:45.060 --> 57:47.120
The sword's a Grade One national relic.

57:47.190 --> 57:48.960
It belongs to all of humanity.

57:49.030 --> 57:51.930
It's only right we return it
to the world via the museum.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.300
Anyway what's key to the
project are the meteorites.

57:55.370 --> 57:57.670
These two artifacts have nothing to do with them.

57:58.100 --> 58:00.300
Before my experiments draw a conclusion,

58:00.370 --> 58:02.340
anything may prove to be a critical link.

58:02.410 --> 58:04.430
How can you prejudge it by saying otherwise?

58:04.510 --> 58:06.440
My experiments will benefit all mankind.

58:06.510 --> 58:09.070
Artifacts are old, dead things.

58:09.150 --> 58:10.880
They have no life, no future!

58:10.950 --> 58:13.180
What science is concerned with
is precisely the future!

58:13.250 --> 58:14.650
Fine, if that's what you say,

58:14.890 --> 58:17.360
then how come these 2000-year-old artifacts

58:17.420 --> 58:18.550
are so important to you?

58:18.620 --> 58:20.590
I risked my life for that sword!

58:20.660 --> 58:22.390
That was me!

58:26.370 --> 58:29.100
OK! In that case, when I find the meteorites,

58:29.170 --> 58:30.430
you'll still give them away?

58:30.500 --> 58:31.990
Yes.

58:32.270 --> 58:35.370
As long as it's someone else's artifacts
I'll return them.

58:35.540 --> 58:38.140
No one can plunder relics
from someone else's country

58:38.210 --> 58:39.910
and put them in their own museums.

58:39.980 --> 58:42.910
They call it 'safe-keeping' but it's theft.

58:42.980 --> 58:45.110
It's despicable behavior.

58:47.290 --> 58:48.950
So what are we going to do now?

58:51.090 --> 58:52.680
What can I do?

59:01.270 --> 59:02.390
William.

59:03.240 --> 59:06.330
Do you want to meet your sponsor
for the last 10 years?

59:07.070 --> 59:09.940
Of course! But he doesn't want to see me!

59:10.210 --> 59:12.140
I'll bring you to him now.

59:12.550 --> 59:13.530
Right now?

59:13.580 --> 59:15.050
Come with me.

59:21.120 --> 59:25.390
I'll return these relics to Dasar for you.

59:26.130 --> 59:27.680
Thank you.

59:45.710 --> 59:49.110
Professor Koo? It's you?

59:49.320 --> 59:52.050
It's been years since I was a professor.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:06.530
Mr Koo, you've been funding
my work all these years?

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:11.040
That's right.
I had my eye on you even before you graduated.

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:16.000
Maggie, cancel my contract with the foundation.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.270
I won't accept sponsorship

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.310
from a tomb-raiding 'archaeologist'!

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.080
<i>And you and Jack</i>

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:29.250
<i>weren't raiding tombs in Dasar?</i>

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:36.280
I've unearthed many treasures in my lifetime,

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:39.120
<i>but the best ones I found</i>

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.690
<i>are you and Jack.</i>

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.070
Don't you hate him?

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.690
No.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.770
Even if he has hurt me deeply.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:57.170
So what do you want from me?

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:01.450
Stay with Jack.

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:06.150
<i>Enlighten him.</i>

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:11.160
He'll make you the world's greatest scientist.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.660
<i>Isn't that your life's dream?</i>

01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:23.340
The 36th year of the Emperor's reign.

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:27.310
Star fell on eastern province,
turned to stone on Earth.

01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:33.520
<i>The meteorite was engraved
with a curse on the Emperor.</i>

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:38.390
<i>So the Emperor tried to kill
everyone around him...</i>

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:44.760
<i>to keep the secret of the meteorite.</i>

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:06.710
Look! General Nangong's returned!

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.410
Out of the way!

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.830
Report to the General at once!

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.740
How is my father?

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.940
How is His Majesty?

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.240
<i>Report!</i>

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.520
General Nangong has returned
with important intelligence.

01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:03.500
Well, how is His Majesty?

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:05.970
His Majesty's...

01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:12.540
General, the Immortal Pill is ready.

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:16.880
On his way back with it,
General Xu was ambushed by rebels.

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:19.990
Prepare the troops for departure.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:21.220
Yes, sir.

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:22.990
-Fresh horses!
-Yes, sir!

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:28.590
If word gets out,
your whole clan will be executed!

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.240
Your servant wouldn't dare!

01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:39.210
<i>Please tell the Chancellor,</i>

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.480
<i>I don't know anything. I'll never tell!</i>

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.680
<i>I... don't know anything.</i>

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.940
<i>Please assure the Chancellor...</i>

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:50.480
Father had too many people around him.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.320
I fear for our plans.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.450
The concubines are ready
to be entombed with him.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.970
Your Majesty, the Immortal Pill is ready,

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.900
but was taken in a rebel ambush.

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.910
Your servant begs leave to
go retrieve it forthwith!

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:15.670
General Meng, your duty is His Majesty's safety.
You should stay...

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:18.740
Action is most urgent!

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:20.940
I await His Majesty's decree.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:30.060
His Majesty commands General Meng...

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.460
to retrieve the pill!

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:32.690
As ordered!

01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:34.060
Wait!

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:39.630
His Majesty has few troops in his entourage.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:45.370
If you go all out for the pill,
and the rebels strike,

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.500
I fear for His Majesty's safety.

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:54.410
In that case I'll only take the Light Cavalry.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.560
I won't tell!

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.400
<i>His Majesty still needs treatment!</i>

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.830
<i>Let me try once more!</i>

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.400
General Meng Yi!

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.790
Farewell, Your Highness.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.460
You must come back!

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:40.590
The Pill can save His Majesty's life,
and therefore yours too.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.560
Yi swears, my heart is yours forever.

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:03.680
I await your return.

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.790
Attention, soldiers of the Meng clan!

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.890
Those with aged parents are excused!

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.830
The only sons are excused!

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:22.840
Husbands and fathers are excused!

01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:30.410
Those who are excused guard the camp!
The rest of you, mount!

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.040
General!

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.580
How many years have we shared our honor?

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:41.090
Why can we not live and die together now?

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.860
Nangong Yan swears to follow you even unto death!

01:06:51.940 --> 01:07:05.780
We swear to follow the General!...

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:56.319
I have orders from the Chancellor
to take the Pill.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:00.729
Failure to hand it over is disobedience, Xu Gui!

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.830
I can only give the Pill to General Meng,

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:08.569
but no one else.

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:25.560
The Chancellor bears His Majesty's word.

01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:30.090
Obey or die!

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.870
Prepare to attack!

01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:44.000
Prepare to attack!

01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:49.310
Defenses!

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.010
Ready archers!

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:10.330
Shoot!

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:20.070
Charge!

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.620
Attack!

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:34.010
Zhao Kuang, His Majesty orders!
Yield at once!

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.120
You dare fake an Imperial Decree?

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:40.150
General Meng?

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:43.820
Leave none alive!

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:51.460
General Zhao, General Meng
comes with an Imperial Decree!

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:53.730
Why do you disobey?

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.270
Your disobedience in the field will be punished!

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.900
Attack!

01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:11.790
Soldiers at the back!

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.450
No one moves without my orders!

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.320
Attack!

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:23.320
Xu Gui!

01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:31.900
-General Meng!
-Meng Jie?

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.070
The Chancellor wants you dead.

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:36.200
Behind my troops is the only way out.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.180
General, there's no time!
You go with Meng Jie.

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:44.810
I'll hold them off.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.410
Go!

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.150
After them!

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.050
Out of the way!

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.560
Out of the way!

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.940
My bow!

01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:15.950
Out of the way! Everyone out of the way!

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.930
Go! Hurry!

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:34.900
Go!

01:15:33.230 --> 01:15:34.420
Black Wind!

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.700
Archers, ready!

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:49.940
Shoot!

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.380
Shoot!

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:10.680
General!

01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:12.420
Take the Pill and go!

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:15.050
General!

01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:17.330
The Pill must reach the Emperor!

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.300
Protect Concubine Li!

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.200
General! Farewell!

01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:26.270
Go!

01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.440
Black Wind, you have done your duty.

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.490
Jack.

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:17.420
Sorry. You were right.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.360
Those relics should be returned.

01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:24.270
I made you something. I hope you like it.

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:28.600
Thank you.

01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:34.200
I looked up the geographical data
within 500 miles of Xian.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.310
You once told me your dreams
of waterfalls and tunnels.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.650
I hope this will help.

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:45.250
How far is this waterfall from Mount Li?

01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:48.620
About 200 kilometers.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.200
Sensors indicate a huge cave
behind the waterfall.

01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:02.500
There were many rainstorms one year,

01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:04.100
and the cave never reappeared since.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.670
Thank you. Good-bye.

01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:11.080
Jack, there's a cave behind the waterfall.

01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:12.670
and a huge opening behind the cave.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:16.450
That's right.
A dozen years ago there was a drought.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.180
The water dried up.

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.160
The cave behind the waterfall appeared,

01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:22.220
and a foolhardy villager climbed in.

01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:24.250
Then it started to rain,

01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:26.890
water quickly concealed the entrance again.

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.430
The villager was never seen again.

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:32.440
What do you plan to do?

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:33.870
I’m going into the waterfall.

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:35.270
How?

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.640
Get flushed in.

01:18:36.710 --> 01:18:39.870
You crazy? That's very dangerous!

01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:44.240
You don't even know if your dream is real!

01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:48.550
Sure! I don't know if it's real or not,

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.590
or who the person in the dream is to me.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.630
But I can feel her love.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:57.790
So you're saying, unless you unravel this dream,

01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:59.660
you'll never be at peace.

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.590
What a blessed place!

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:27.280
Wind, water, all the elements are in place.

01:19:28.690 --> 01:19:33.560
Jack, only you could have brought me here.

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:02.810
William, do you copy?

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:06.720
Loud and clear, Jack. I can see you.

01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:09.290
I'll contact you as soon as I'm in.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:11.020
But if...

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.850
No ifs and buts.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.360
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.060
I'll be in touch.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.930
Don't worry.

01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:24.940
Whether it's brain or brawn, he's your superior.

01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:59.660
Jack what's happening?

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.960
Jack...

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.540
Are you all right?

01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:07.810
My ass hurts.

01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:20.780
William, I see an opening...

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:22.760
with man-made designs.

01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:24.590
Like the sketches you drew?

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:26.190
I'll see if I can get inside.

01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:29.460
Contact you later.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.500
Get ready to begin.

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:35.900
Now!

01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:09.020
Meng Yi.

01:26:13.330 --> 01:26:14.960
Meng Yi...

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.930
you've finally returned!

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:33.720
I am your Ok Soo.
You've finally come!

01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:38.580
Ok Soo...

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.690
It's really you?

01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:47.760
You were really waiting for me!

01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:50.930
Am I dreaming?

01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:56.070
I promised I'd live for you!
I've kept my word.

01:26:56.610 --> 01:27:01.370
You kept yours too.
You've really returned!

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:24.830
Jack!

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.800
Jack, thank you!

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.370
Without you,

01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:39.140
this secret will stay buried
for another eternity!

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:43.820
This place is exactly like Jack's dream!

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:47.280
I can't explain it scientifically.

01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:49.860
There are many things in this world...

01:27:49.930 --> 01:27:53.920
...that science can't explain.

01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:56.430
This cavern stays warm the year round.

01:27:56.670 --> 01:28:01.100
It's shunt off from the world
but air flows freely.

01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:04.470
They made massive constructions at Mount Li,

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:08.910
but dug a 100-mile tunnel

01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:13.040
to build the mausoleum here.

01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:17.120
Brilliant!

01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:21.220
A masterstroke of deception!

01:28:22.290 --> 01:28:25.820
But where's the entrance to the mausoleum?

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:09.800
Your Highness! Beware!

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.250
Stop! General Nangong!

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:12.520
He's Meng Yi! General Meng!

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.150
Impossible!

01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:18.400
He can't be General Meng!

01:31:18.970 --> 01:31:22.630
No warrior is General Meng's match!
How can he be him?

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:29.870
He really is General Meng!
There's no mistake!

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:40.150
You really are the General?

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.650
Greetings to the General!

01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:48.400
Sir, I have followed your order

01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:51.990
to protect Concubine Li pending your return.

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.260
Mr Koo...

01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:11.150
Great work, Mr Koo!

01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:13.550
You've discovered the secret of levitation.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.330
Weightlessness carries grave dangers.

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:25.970
If we lose traction and float off,

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:30.060
we'll be adrift forever,
and turn into living fossils.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.700
Hold on!

01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:46.520
After I left you that day,
I returned with the Pill.

01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:49.350
His Majesty was barely alive,

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:51.620
but Zhao Gao doubted the Pill's veracity.

01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:54.630
He ordered me to personally test it.

01:32:55.130 --> 01:32:57.030
Chancellor Li said...

01:32:57.170 --> 01:33:01.300
it was our honor to test
the Pill for the Emperor,

01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:03.770
and forced me to take it too.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.770
And so, those who wanted to live didn't,

01:33:08.010 --> 01:33:11.140
and those who wished to die can never do so.

01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:13.680
General, what happened that day

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:15.550
after I left?

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:23.520
That day, after I gave you the Pill...

01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:30.760
Black Wind, you have done your duty.

01:34:24.150 --> 01:34:29.820
Fighting by your side today

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:33.550
has been Xu Gui's greatest honor in life.

01:34:34.530 --> 01:34:36.260
I take my leave...

01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:53.280
Halt!

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:04.250
Attack!

01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:45.130
Attack!

01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:55.800
Surrender, General!

01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:58.340
Surrender, General!

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.620
No, never...

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:05.100
I won't believe it.

01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:09.070
If General Meng fell in battle...

01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:12.700
then who are you?

01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:15.440
I am...

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:32.090
Everything is as I expected.

01:39:46.810 --> 01:39:48.800
Life after death...

01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:53.410
...troops in an eternal vigil...

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.420
I've found you at last!

01:39:57.390 --> 01:40:00.650
Who'd have thought,
the Qin Emperor would use the meteorite

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:03.450
to create a weightless world?

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:11.960
General, did you bring troops?

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:14.070
No.

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.970
Wait for me here.

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:24.480
Careful.

01:40:28.050 --> 01:40:31.080
Who dares to intrude the mausoleum?

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.520
A Qin-dynasty man?

01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:37.120
Immortal?!

01:40:41.670 --> 01:40:44.630
Jack! Are you all right?

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:48.160
William! You conned me from day one.

01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:49.770
You've been working for him all along!

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.210
I...

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:54.500
Jack, I told you before.

01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:56.010
Greed is human nature,

01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:00.140
and desire for knowledge drives us.

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:03.550
I merely made use of William's greed,

01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:05.510
and your desire for knowledge.

01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:08.680
And now my life's work is complete!

01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:13.930
When you turned me in, I told myself,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.830
one day you'll make it up to me.

01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:24.060
Jack, all I want is to take some
stuff back for experiments.

01:41:24.170 --> 01:41:27.110
My discoveries will benefit the world.

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:30.140
I'll become the greatest
scientist of the century!

01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:32.040
No one can take anything from here.

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:35.710
This is a part of history.
It should stay buried forever!

01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:40.490
Without you,
I couldn't have solved this maze...

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:43.490
in several lifetimes!

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.650
Professor!

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.830
Scoundrel!
How dare you defile the mausoleum?

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.770
The penalty is death!

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:05.980
Nangong Yan! Careful!

01:42:10.050 --> 01:42:12.850
Don't shoot! I want him alive!

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.550
Take care of Ok Soo.

01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:06.070
Where's the Immortality Pill?

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:08.640
Tell me.

01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:11.070
Halt!

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.850
General Nangong!

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.840
'When the dragon pearl moves,
annihilation ensues'

01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:11.970
Pull me in.

01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:13.770
Quick, give me a hand.

01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:22.420
General Nangong!

01:44:25.090 --> 01:44:27.280
Concubine Li! Run!

01:44:34.230 --> 01:44:36.660
<i>Give me your hand! Quick!</i>

01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:41.670
<i>Use your legs.</i>

01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:44.300
<i>Right, your legs.</i>

01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:57.750
Pull me in.

01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:11.130
A Qin-dynasty Deputy Imperial General!

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.490
Tell me!

01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:38.020
Where's the Immortality Pill?

01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:41.060
Where's the Qin Emperor's sarcophagus?

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.960
It must be in the Celestial Palace.

01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:56.780
Take me there! Take me there!

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:06.950
Stay where you are!

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:09.790
Don't you dare try to steal anything...

01:46:10.090 --> 01:46:12.120
or take her away!

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.430
That depends on whether you can stop me.

01:47:21.330 --> 01:47:24.600
Don't worry. I won't let anyone hurt you.

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:50.180
Jack! Help me! Jack!

01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:57.490
Jack!

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:07.110
Ok Soo, I'll take you away from here.

01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:14.980
Let's go.

01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:39.240
Jack...

01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:40.570
William!

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:44.110
-William!
-Help me!

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.610
Hang on to me!

01:48:48.690 --> 01:48:50.650
I only do scientific research,

01:48:51.090 --> 01:48:53.060
I’m no tomb raider!

01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:02.330
You must get out no matter what,

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.730
and finish my research!

01:49:08.610 --> 01:49:10.400
Jack...

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:16.700
Jack, are we still friends?

01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:31.660
Jack...

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:37.160
You really aren't Meng Yi?

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.170
No, I'm not...

01:49:45.010 --> 01:49:46.570
Whether I’m Meng Yi or not
doesn't matter now.

01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:48.740
What's important is that
we leave here at once!

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:52.540
You're not Meng Yi.

01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:55.570
I’m not leaving.

01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:58.280
I'll await Meng Yi's return.

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.620
Ok Soo, hurry! There's no time!

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:04.350
No! He's not dead!

01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:06.220
I'll wait for him!

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.690
Ok Soo!

01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:10.020
Ok Soo!

01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:57.140
At last! Immortality!

01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:55.400
<i>Six months later</i>
