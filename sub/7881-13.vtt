00:34.583 --> 00:37.375
The TV is mine, boys.
Downton Abbey is on,

00:37.417 --> 00:39.750
and I intend to see if
Lord Grantham will be able

00:39.792 --> 00:41.834
to modernize his
accounting practices.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.709
Dad, just hold on; we're
on the last level of the game.

00:44.750 --> 00:47.083
What is this game?

00:47.125 --> 00:49.667
You're just throwing stuff
at old-timey ladies.

00:49.709 --> 00:52.542
You go back in time
and have to find Hitler's mom

00:52.583 --> 00:53.583
when she was pregnant with him

00:53.625 --> 00:55.291
and somehow induce
a miscarriage.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.667
It's called
Nazi Natal Nightmare.

01:00.792 --> 01:02.166
Keep tossing!

01:02.208 --> 01:03.291
She's heading for the hospital

01:03.333 --> 01:05.166
to give birth, but
it's not too late!

01:05.208 --> 01:07.750
We need to aim for the soft spot
on baby Hitler's head.

01:07.792 --> 01:09.166
One direct hit there,

01:09.208 --> 01:11.333
and we can still prevent
the Holocaust.

01:14.625 --> 01:17.166
You killed my grandparents,
you bastard!

01:17.208 --> 01:19.417
I'm tired of you kids
always being indoors

01:19.458 --> 01:20.625
and playing video games.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.000
Play outside for a change.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.834
But we already completed
Outside.

01:24.875 --> 01:28.083
And Outside II:
Without a Sweater.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.792
Have you kids ever spent
a day outside

01:29.834 --> 01:32.917
just throwing actual rocks
with your actual arms?

01:32.959 --> 01:34.375
Nah.
No, no.

01:34.417 --> 01:36.208
Hmm.
No. I've heard of rocks.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.041
No.
No.
No.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.250
Have any of you ever held
an actual nudie magazine

01:40.291 --> 01:41.542
that your friend, Mark,

01:41.583 --> 01:43.125
pulled out of the Dumpster
at church?

01:43.166 --> 01:45.583
Oh, no, haven't done that, no.
No.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.375
And I bet you've never
felt the rush

01:47.417 --> 01:50.375
of stumbling across a dead body
while roaming through the woods.

01:50.417 --> 01:51.542
No, Papa.

01:51.583 --> 01:53.041
Well, I have.

01:53.083 --> 01:55.583
And all that real-life living
made me the man I am today.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.208
I didn't need video games.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.875
I invented my own games,
like rock fight.

01:59.917 --> 02:02.333
Not sure
you invented rock fights.

02:02.375 --> 02:03.583
I did invent it!

02:03.625 --> 02:04.625
And I was the champion.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.208
I defeated the guy
who taught me.

02:06.250 --> 02:07.917
Dad, we make our own games, too.

02:07.959 --> 02:09.875
That game you
so rudely shut off,

02:09.917 --> 02:12.583
that was an existing
Franco-Prussian war game

02:12.625 --> 02:15.000
we jzushed up with code
we wrote ourselves.

02:15.041 --> 02:17.792
Steve, the words you just
strung together devastate me.

02:17.834 --> 02:20.125
Go outside and play now!

02:29.291 --> 02:31.458
Oh, for God's sake.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.500
Dad, we were FaceTiming
with each other!

02:39.542 --> 02:42.083
You really have to do
something about your dad.

02:42.125 --> 02:44.208
Who said that?
Identify yourself.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.458
Stan, what's going on?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.375
These kids are wasting
their childhoods

02:48.417 --> 02:50.000
on their video games
and phones.

02:50.041 --> 02:52.542
So, this weekend,
I'm taking them to the woods

02:52.583 --> 02:55.083
so they can have the kind
of adventures I had as a kid.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.709
Absolutely not.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.458
Steve can't handle the woods.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.083
He wears Velcro laces, Stan.

03:01.125 --> 03:04.166
Velcro, like an infant.

03:04.208 --> 03:06.333
But, Mom... I mean Francine!

03:06.375 --> 03:07.792
Forget it, Stan.

03:07.834 --> 03:10.041
You will not take
our boy into the woods

03:10.083 --> 03:12.750
or you're grounded!
I mean, cut off from sex.

03:12.792 --> 03:15.458
Promise me you won't
take him, Stan.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.667
All right, I promise, Francine.

03:19.542 --> 03:21.250
Will Stan keep his promise?

03:21.291 --> 03:24.291
Will Steve and the boys
get their phones fixed?
Will they...?

03:24.333 --> 03:26.417
Get in the house, Randy!

03:30.917 --> 03:32.583
Have you ever looked up
at the night sky

03:32.625 --> 03:35.083
and thought,
"I'd like to get in on that"?

03:35.125 --> 03:37.250
At the International
Star Registry,

03:37.291 --> 03:40.333
you can actually
purchase your own star.

03:40.375 --> 03:42.917
I bought one for my wife
on our anniversary.

03:42.959 --> 03:45.625
I bought one for myself
when I got passed over at work.

03:45.667 --> 03:48.750
I haven't bought one yet,
but I'm real close.

03:48.792 --> 03:50.542
Ha! What a bunch of suckers.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.125
That's as stupid
as buying a goat

03:52.166 --> 03:53.667
for a poor family in Africa.

03:53.709 --> 03:55.583
Roger, you know
every year

03:55.625 --> 03:57.875
I buy a goat for a
poor family in Africa.

03:57.917 --> 04:00.834
Oh, right, you're the sucker
that actually cares about stuff.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.458
And by the way,
you're wasting your money

04:02.500 --> 04:03.834
sending a goat over there.

04:03.875 --> 04:05.875
You could have shipped
Jim Breuer for half the cost.

04:05.917 --> 04:10.333
American Dad remembers
Jim Breuer.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.291
You know what, I am
sick of you pretending

04:13.333 --> 04:14.667
you don't care
about anything

04:14.667 --> 04:17.250
and making fun of
those of us who do.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.291
Sure, make another joke.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.792
But deep down, I know
you care about something,

04:24.834 --> 04:26.542
and I'm gonna
find out what.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.375
Sounds like a great use
of your time,

04:28.417 --> 04:30.458
but three things you might
want to deal with first:

04:30.500 --> 04:32.667
mustache, eyebrows...

04:32.709 --> 04:35.583
mustache.

04:39.417 --> 04:41.709
Steve's never gonna have
the type of childhood I had.

04:41.750 --> 04:42.875
It's sad.

04:42.917 --> 04:44.875
Kids today!

04:44.917 --> 04:46.291
When I was a lad,

04:46.333 --> 04:48.792
I never saw the point
of playing inside.

04:48.834 --> 04:51.875
Until I was sent
to an all-boy's boarding school.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.375
Then my tune changed.

04:54.417 --> 04:56.583
What I'd love to do
is drop those kids

04:56.667 --> 04:57.834
in the middle of the forest,

04:57.875 --> 04:59.750
make them have
some real experiences,

04:59.792 --> 05:01.875
like wolves' kids do.

05:01.917 --> 05:05.166
Sir, these cucumber sandwiches
are divine,

05:05.208 --> 05:07.250
but when did the CIA
get a tearoom?

05:07.291 --> 05:10.291
At the same time
that we got a yacht!

05:13.625 --> 05:14.917
Whoa!
What the hell?!

05:14.959 --> 05:16.000
Where are we?

05:16.041 --> 05:17.917
I'll tell you
where we are.

05:17.959 --> 05:20.625
At the top of an
active volcano!

05:21.625 --> 05:23.458
What was in that tea?

05:23.500 --> 05:25.000
A very light opiate,

05:25.041 --> 05:27.625
but that has nothing to do with
the visions you're seeing.

05:27.667 --> 05:29.333
Follow me.

05:31.709 --> 05:35.208
This control room is able
to calibrate force fields

05:35.250 --> 05:37.625
so strong that
the holographic images

05:37.667 --> 05:40.291
projected onto them feel real
to the touch.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.250
Ah! So it works like
the holodeck.

05:42.291 --> 05:44.041
The what now?
From Star Trek.

05:44.083 --> 05:47.125
Some of us spent the late '80s
and early '90s

05:47.166 --> 05:48.709
getting laid, Smith.

05:48.750 --> 05:52.417
In any event, I call this room
the hologram deck.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.542
So it can recreate
any environment?

05:54.583 --> 05:58.250
Well, any environment stored
in our bank of human memories.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.000
Wait, you recorded our memories?

06:00.041 --> 06:03.500
Yes. Remember those headphones
you got for Christmas?

06:03.542 --> 06:05.458
They weren't headphones.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.041
Those things never worked.

06:07.083 --> 06:08.875
Actually, they worked perfectly.

06:08.917 --> 06:11.500
Here's one of mine.
Have a look.

06:12.834 --> 06:15.667
Oh, Avery,
you're as tight as the fabric

06:15.709 --> 06:18.000
on a reupholstered
davenport.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.500
Not for long, I wasn't.

06:20.542 --> 06:24.542
This was the day I started
to like playing inside.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.709
Playing inside, eh?

06:26.750 --> 06:27.917
Wait a minute.

06:27.959 --> 06:30.500
So this holodeck
could simulate the woods

06:30.542 --> 06:31.875
I played in as a child?

06:31.917 --> 06:33.792
Of course it can, Smith,

06:33.834 --> 06:38.083
but you do know we're seconds
away from a sex scene, right?

06:41.667 --> 06:43.875
This one's going straight
to Instagram.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.333
Oh, Klaus already liked it.

06:46.375 --> 06:47.500
Thanks, Klaus!

06:47.542 --> 06:49.041
No, thank you!

06:49.083 --> 06:50.208
Hey, Roger.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.500
I decided to buy
a little present for myself.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.333
You bought a star.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.625
Hilarious.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.208
Not just any star.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.375
Look closer.

06:58.417 --> 07:01.166
X3Q8F-3X?

07:01.250 --> 07:04.375
That's-that's my
home planet's sun.

07:04.417 --> 07:06.542
And I own the deed.
It's mine.

07:06.583 --> 07:08.375
I guess that makes me
your leader.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.166
Yeah, it bothers you,
doesn't it?

07:12.208 --> 07:14.792
Maybe I found something
you care about.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.375
It's a piece of paper that
means absolutely nothing.

07:17.417 --> 07:19.542
I don't care.
I don't care at all.

07:19.583 --> 07:20.959
Oh, then you won't care

07:21.000 --> 07:23.166
if I name the star
after something you hate.

07:23.208 --> 07:25.166
You could name it
Jessica Seinfeld,

07:25.208 --> 07:26.208
for all I care.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.208
Maybe I will.

07:28.250 --> 07:31.583
Oh, my God,
why did I put that in her head?

07:36.083 --> 07:37.750
Oh, no! Her water broke.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.291
We're running
out of time!

07:39.333 --> 07:40.500
Hit her with everything!

07:40.542 --> 07:42.250
Toshi, use your mega-hanger!

07:50.542 --> 07:54.250
I know he's gonna be a monster,
but I do love babies.

07:54.291 --> 07:57.083
Boys, I'm sorry I was
a jerk the other day.

07:57.125 --> 07:58.333
I'd like to make
it up to you.

07:58.375 --> 08:00.041
I'm taking you all
to Gamer Town

08:00.083 --> 08:02.083
to buy you whatever
games you want.

08:03.417 --> 08:05.250
I also got you guys
these cheeseburgers.

08:05.291 --> 08:07.333
Can't buy video games
on an empty stomach.

08:07.375 --> 08:09.709
Well, I guess today
is gonna be my cheat day.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.166
Thanks, Dad.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.291
You really came around on thi...

08:15.625 --> 08:17.792
Mine's not working.

08:17.834 --> 08:19.166
Have three more.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.208
Oh, man.

08:27.250 --> 08:30.333
Your dad must have roofied
those hamburgers.

08:30.375 --> 08:32.458
Where the hell are we?

08:32.500 --> 08:34.000
You're in the forest.

08:34.041 --> 08:36.083
But not the actual forest,

08:36.125 --> 08:39.291
so technically I kept my promise
to Francine.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.375
My first promise.

08:41.417 --> 08:43.667
I can't believe my
dad ditched us here.

08:47.291 --> 08:50.125
Guys, how long do you think
we can last out here?

08:50.166 --> 08:52.125
I don't know,
but if we're gonna die,

08:52.166 --> 08:55.041
I'm not going out
a virgin.

08:55.083 --> 08:57.709
Well, if trees count,
then I'm Wilt Chamberlain.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.875
Come on, you guys,
don't just stand there.

08:59.917 --> 09:01.875
Explore the forest,
have adventures.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.333
Hmm.

09:03.375 --> 09:06.709
Turning down the temperature
ought to get them moving.

09:08.792 --> 09:11.083
Wow, it's
getting chilly.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.959
Does anyone know
how to build a fire?

09:13.000 --> 09:16.291
I know a fire-making spell
from Harry Potter.

09:16.333 --> 09:19.166
We need to climb into someone's
abdomen for warmth.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.959
Everyone whose name
isn't Barry, meeting.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.250
Wait, I got a better idea.

09:23.291 --> 09:26.041
Maybe we should spoon
for warmth.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.000
I wish there was a
movie we could watch.

09:30.041 --> 09:31.458
A movie?!

09:31.500 --> 09:33.000
You're in the middle
of the forest!

09:33.041 --> 09:34.917
All you're doing
is lying around!

09:34.959 --> 09:36.291
That's it,

09:36.333 --> 09:38.000
this train's moving
out of the station right now!

09:40.041 --> 09:41.417
Toshi, you're out of sync.

09:41.458 --> 09:42.959
Can you please
bring your breath

09:43.000 --> 09:44.417
into alignment
with the rest of us?

09:49.500 --> 09:51.250
Oh, my God! A bear!

09:51.291 --> 09:52.375
Protect me!

09:52.417 --> 09:54.500
I look the most
like a honey pot!

10:03.333 --> 10:05.375
Roger, what are
you doing?

10:05.417 --> 10:07.250
Who are you to wake up
and question me?

10:07.291 --> 10:10.083
You wouldn't happen to be
looking for this, would you?

10:10.125 --> 10:12.333
Look, I'll give you
the certificate, Roger.

10:12.375 --> 10:15.375
You just have to admit
you care about it.

10:15.417 --> 10:17.959
This is not the thing
I'm looking for.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.166
Are-are you trying to
use the Force on me?

10:20.208 --> 10:22.083
You know that's
make-believe, right?

10:22.125 --> 10:23.375
So's Rocky!

10:23.417 --> 10:25.250
Ow!
Sorry!

10:27.166 --> 10:28.834
I'm getting kind of scared.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.166
What happens if we never find
our way home?

10:34.750 --> 10:36.375
Guys, relax.

10:36.417 --> 10:37.750
My dad can be a jerk,

10:37.792 --> 10:39.917
but he's not gonna let us die
out in the forest.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.458
He's just trying
to teach us a lesson.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.583
I'm hungry.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.250
Are you sure
you're not just tired?

10:44.291 --> 10:45.250
I don't know!

10:45.291 --> 10:47.208
All my feelings
feel like hungry!

10:47.250 --> 10:50.667
Well, let's try to find
something we can eat.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.583
Well, my plan seems
to be working.

10:54.625 --> 10:56.542
Now if I push off just right,

10:56.583 --> 10:59.291
it should carry me all the way
to the hot cocoa machine.

11:00.291 --> 11:03.667
I'm Sandra Bullock!

11:04.500 --> 11:06.500
Ow!

11:08.500 --> 11:10.291
Guys! Come quick!

11:10.333 --> 11:12.333
Look what I just knocked open.

11:12.375 --> 11:13.625
Oh, my God!

11:13.667 --> 11:16.291
Somebody killed a robot
and buried it in the forest!

11:16.333 --> 11:17.458
No, Barry.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.291
I-It's obviously
a control panel.

11:19.333 --> 11:22.667
I need you to
respect my ideas.

11:26.417 --> 11:28.834
Look!

11:33.000 --> 11:34.041
Integrity breach.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.417
Panel exposed.

11:35.458 --> 11:36.625
Damn.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.500
Better close that panel
before the boys see it.

11:40.458 --> 11:41.875
Dad.

11:41.917 --> 11:44.709
He clearly put us in
some sort of CIA holodeck.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.709
I am fuming...

11:46.750 --> 11:48.375
and also nerding out!

11:55.291 --> 11:57.583
Come on, now's our chance!

11:59.333 --> 12:01.041
Whoa!

12:03.291 --> 12:06.500
Looks like
the tables have turned.

12:06.542 --> 12:07.834
Yep.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.500
I'd say this is a classic
dad-puts-son-in-holodeck-

12:10.542 --> 12:12.166
then-finds-himself-
in-said-holodeck-

12:12.208 --> 12:14.000
that's-now-controlled-
by-son scenario.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.000
Greetings, subject.

12:25.041 --> 12:26.333
On your feet, peasant!

12:26.375 --> 12:28.250
What... what the hell
is going on?

12:28.291 --> 12:31.041
Well, since I'm queen
of your solar system,

12:31.083 --> 12:32.875
I figured I should start
dressing like it.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.709
That's why I'm
wearing a prom dress

12:34.750 --> 12:36.375
from the
Salvation Army.

12:36.417 --> 12:38.291
Okay, first of all, Hayley,

12:38.333 --> 12:40.291
we have a prime minister,
all right?

12:40.333 --> 12:42.625
Second, dress how you like.
I couldn't care less.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.750
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a soufflé.

12:47.417 --> 12:51.750
This is Miss Kentucky 2007
all over again.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.041
Hey, look.

12:56.083 --> 12:59.709
They have the recorded memories
of every CIA agent.

12:59.750 --> 13:00.750
Hmm...

13:00.792 --> 13:02.166
Let's mess with him.

13:02.208 --> 13:04.959
He thinks his childhood was
so much better than ours,

13:05.000 --> 13:06.875
let's send him
back there.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.417
Wait, this is my childhood home!

13:14.458 --> 13:15.750
What's happening?

13:15.792 --> 13:18.750
Oh, the boys must have gotten
into the control room.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.125
Stan?

13:20.166 --> 13:21.250
Stan, is that you?

13:21.291 --> 13:22.625
Daddy?

13:22.667 --> 13:25.250
Hello, son.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.583
I love you!

13:26.625 --> 13:29.375
Wait, that's not
how Grandpa talks.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.667
He says "I love you"
with a cup check.

13:31.709 --> 13:33.291
I'll tell you why.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.500
His memories are being

13:34.542 --> 13:36.583
put through a
nostalgia filter.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.500
He's seeing all of this
through rose-colored glasses.

13:39.542 --> 13:41.458
Well, let's take
this down to zero

13:41.500 --> 13:43.458
and see how things
really were.

13:44.458 --> 13:45.834
I remember a time

13:45.875 --> 13:48.542
when we didn't need
a nostalgia filter.

13:48.583 --> 13:51.917
Oh, those were the days.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.000
Get out of here, I'm busy!

13:56.041 --> 13:57.250
Go play in your tree house!

13:57.291 --> 13:58.542
Oh.

13:58.583 --> 13:59.583
Okay.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.458
Yeah, I'll go play
in my tree house.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.834
Tree house!

14:06.125 --> 14:07.333
Oh, yeah.

14:07.375 --> 14:08.458
I remember that.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.667
How is he liking this?

14:10.709 --> 14:13.542
Ah... the old hood.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.125
Thanks, boys, this is great!

14:15.166 --> 14:17.750
There's the factory,
the slaughterhouse

14:17.792 --> 14:20.208
and the river of clotted beef
blood that came out of it

14:20.250 --> 14:23.041
where I used
to race paper boats.

14:23.083 --> 14:26.667
Ooh, I'm where I discovered
my first dead body!

14:28.500 --> 14:30.959
Aw, there's my special guy.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.792
This isn't messing with him.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.750
It's weird
and he's loving it.

14:34.792 --> 14:37.000
You guys, what can we do
to mess with him?

14:37.041 --> 14:40.709
Well, this is basically
just a big computer game.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.375
I can try to
change the code.

14:42.417 --> 14:43.834
Yes, my toad.

14:43.875 --> 14:46.125
"Pwn" him.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.625
I didn't notice
when I was younger,

14:47.667 --> 14:50.000
but this is a great tie.

14:50.041 --> 14:51.500
I wasn't trying to steal it!

14:55.709 --> 14:56.917
Nice job, Snot!

14:56.959 --> 14:58.291
It's so real!

14:58.333 --> 15:00.000
I-It looks like he's
actually getting hurt.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.083
He is.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.500
I thought that's
what we wanted.

15:02.542 --> 15:03.625
No!

15:03.667 --> 15:05.792
I-I just wanted to scare
him, not hurt him!

15:05.834 --> 15:08.709
Now might be a good
time to take a break.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.750
Snot, get rid of the zombie!

15:19.792 --> 15:21.083
That's impossible.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.250
The code's merged
with the simulation.

15:23.291 --> 15:24.500
I can't delete it.

15:33.417 --> 15:34.875
Okay, kids, that's enough!

15:34.917 --> 15:36.041
Turn it off!

15:38.250 --> 15:39.125
What the hell?

15:39.166 --> 15:40.792
How did it
get so big?

15:40.834 --> 15:43.542
I used the Klara Hitler
code from our game.

15:43.583 --> 15:44.583
We made her bigger

15:44.625 --> 15:46.709
so it would be easier
to hit her belly.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.625
But we never
won that game!

15:48.667 --> 15:51.083
Wow, we've had
a lot of backfires,

15:51.125 --> 15:52.959
but this is
the most recent.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.208
He's getting larger!

15:55.250 --> 15:56.625
And more confident.

15:56.667 --> 15:59.542
He's not even walking
like a zombie anymore.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.417
He's skipping!

16:05.333 --> 16:07.208
I've got to go save my dad.

16:07.250 --> 16:10.041
I've got to go in there.

16:14.583 --> 16:17.125
Thank you, Toshi,
but I must go alone.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.333
All right, guys.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.458
Armor me and supply me
with weapons.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.959
And can I get some snacks
between me and the target?

16:37.709 --> 16:40.166
Oh, my God,
these dots are delicious!

16:40.208 --> 16:41.750
Who knew?

16:44.667 --> 16:46.625
Oh, greetings,
royal subject.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.959
Be a good vassal
and fetch your queen

16:49.000 --> 16:50.875
a Choco Taco
most frozen.

16:50.917 --> 16:52.291
I'm sorry,
Your Majesty.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.542
Kind of got my hands
full right now.

16:55.625 --> 16:57.083
Recognize this little guy?

16:57.125 --> 16:59.750
It's the goat you bought
for that family in Africa.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.875
Wait, h-how did you get him?

17:01.917 --> 17:03.959
Give me that certificate,
Hayley!

17:04.000 --> 17:05.750
Roger, what the hell
are you doing?!

17:05.792 --> 17:07.208
Hand over that
star certificate

17:07.250 --> 17:09.250
or the goat
gets it!
Are you crazy?!

17:09.291 --> 17:10.417
I don't know.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.959
I just went on a 53-hour
Dexatrim-fueled trip

17:13.000 --> 17:14.500
to Senegal to kidnap a goat!

17:14.542 --> 17:15.750
You tell me!

17:15.792 --> 17:17.500
Okay, fine! Take it!

17:17.542 --> 17:18.625
Geez.

17:18.667 --> 17:20.542
Thank you!
Ha! I win!

17:20.583 --> 17:22.250
Actually, I win.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.291
Because only someone
who truly cared

17:24.333 --> 17:27.375
would have gone to the
lengths that you did.

17:28.625 --> 17:29.959
You poor thing.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.917
You think this is over.

17:33.709 --> 17:35.000
Nice dead guy!

17:35.041 --> 17:36.166
Good little dead guy!

17:36.208 --> 17:37.458
I thought you were
just a salesman

17:37.500 --> 17:38.709
who had a heart attack
on a hike!

17:38.750 --> 17:39.750
What the hell, man?

17:48.959 --> 17:50.750
Dad, take cover!

17:50.792 --> 17:53.166
And it's time for you
to chill out.

17:53.208 --> 17:55.208
Snot, change my gun
to a freeze ray

17:55.250 --> 17:57.250
so my clever line makes sense.

18:07.834 --> 18:10.166
Steve!

18:10.208 --> 18:11.417
Dad!

18:15.417 --> 18:17.458
I don't know if we'll
get out of here, son.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.125
He's unstoppable.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.375
If only he had an Achilles'
heel we could exploit.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.125
That's it!

18:23.166 --> 18:24.500
Snot, come in.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.917
I know you can't take out code,
but can you add it?

18:26.959 --> 18:28.625
Yeah, you got a plan?

18:28.667 --> 18:29.959
I need you to program

18:30.000 --> 18:32.083
the Hitler fetus
into the zombie.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.375
What? Why?

18:33.417 --> 18:35.208
'Cause the zombie
needs a weak spot

18:35.250 --> 18:37.000
that we can use to defeat it.

18:37.041 --> 18:39.667
But we've never been able
to kill the Hitler baby.

18:39.709 --> 18:43.041
Maybe we just didn't have
a good enough reason.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.458
Oh, I get it.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.041
'Cause now it's your family.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.917
Steve, I just pressed "enter."

18:54.959 --> 18:56.375
Did it work?

18:57.500 --> 18:58.792
You did it!

19:02.917 --> 19:04.125
Dad!

19:04.166 --> 19:05.500
The fetus' weakness

19:05.542 --> 19:07.500
is the soft spot
on his head!

19:07.542 --> 19:09.625
You need
a direct hit!

19:09.667 --> 19:10.750
With what?

19:10.792 --> 19:12.834
You said you were champion
of rock fights.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.500
Time to prove it!

19:16.375 --> 19:20.291
Auf Wiedersehen,
you undead son of a bitch!

19:32.458 --> 19:35.000
I'm the champion!

19:35.041 --> 19:37.166
Uh, Dad?

19:40.709 --> 19:42.625
Nice rock
throwin', Pop!

19:42.667 --> 19:44.709
Nice...
video game...

19:44.750 --> 19:45.959
stuff, son!

19:46.000 --> 19:48.250
You know,
I was wrong.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.834
I thought you boys
weren't prepared for the future.

19:50.875 --> 19:53.125
But now I realize your future

19:53.166 --> 19:55.959
is gonna be filled with
that crap, so... keep it up.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.959
You guys'll
be just fine.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.333
Thanks, Dad.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.709
And maybe you can teach me
how to throw a rock sometime.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.000
It's too late
for that, friend.

20:07.208 --> 20:08.834
Oh, I didn't know
other people

20:08.875 --> 20:10.542
used this thing
on the weekends.

20:10.583 --> 20:14.542
You guys can stay,
but it's gonna get really weird.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.333
Darling, hold off.

20:17.375 --> 20:20.250
They don't know
if they're staying yet.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.417
So then Dad nails
the Hitler fetus

20:24.458 --> 20:27.000
right in the head, and
the whole thing explodes!

20:27.041 --> 20:28.166
Wow!

20:28.208 --> 20:29.709
Klaus, that makes
your story

20:29.750 --> 20:31.375
about thinking someone
might've come to the door

20:31.417 --> 20:33.542
around 3:30
really boring.

20:33.583 --> 20:34.875
Maybe I told it wrong.

20:34.917 --> 20:36.125
It was crazy!

20:36.166 --> 20:38.583
Mom, dinner is
delicious tonight.

20:38.625 --> 20:40.083
Oh, Roger made it.

20:40.125 --> 20:41.417
Is it lamb?

20:41.458 --> 20:43.291
Similar to lamb.

20:43.333 --> 20:46.750
Oh... my... God!

20:46.792 --> 20:50.792
American Dad
remembers Mutumbo the goat.

21:24.834 --> 21:26.583
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
