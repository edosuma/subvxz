EXPEL YOU FOR CHEATING.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.153
AHH.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.060
I'M HOME, HARRIETTE,

14:53.126 --> 14:54.561
AND THE SUBJECT IS CLOSED.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.200
SO YOU DIDN'T FIND
OUR FURNITURE?

15:00.267 --> 15:02.869
GREAT. LOOK
WHAT YOU'VE GONE AND DONE.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.637
YOU'VE GONE
AND OPENED UP THE SUBJECT.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.341
CARL...

15:08.408 --> 15:10.377
I'M TIRED OF SITTING
ON THESE LAWN CHAIRS.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.213
MY BUTT'S STARTING
TO LOOK LIKE THE TOP
OF A CHERRY PIE.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.019
HARRIETTE, THIS WHOLE THING
IS STARTING TO GET TO ME.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.787
I'M STARTING
TO DOUBT MYSELF.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.722
CARL,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:22.789 --> 15:26.093
WELL, I MEAN I CAN'T
BELIEVE I SLEPT
THROUGH THE WHOLE ROBBERY.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.962
THIS IS NOT LIKE ME.
I'M A LIGHT SLEEPER.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.331
SURE, I GOT THE REFLEXES
OF A JUNGLE CAT.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.239
THAT'S TRUE, CARL.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.441
YOU KNOW I REMEMBER WHEN
THE KIDS WERE LITTLE

15:41.508 --> 15:43.610
AND NEEDED THEIR
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
FEEDING.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.513
YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE
TO WAKE UP AND SAY,

15:46.579 --> 15:49.149
"HARRIETTE, GET UP
AND FEED THE KIDS."

15:52.552 --> 15:55.455
SO, BIG BRO, YOU GONNA HAUL
YOUR UGLY, GUILTY MUG

15:55.522 --> 15:58.725
DOWN TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
AND COME CLEAN?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.127
I HADN'T
PLANNED ON IT.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.365
WELL, WHY NOT?

16:05.432 --> 16:09.136
LAURA, ONE PERSON
IS ALREADY IN TROUBLE.

16:09.202 --> 16:13.373
IF I CONFESS, TWO PEOPLE
WILL BE IN TROUBLE.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.543
ALL THAT DOES
IS PUT MORE PEOPLE
IN TROUBLE.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.245
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO LIVE WITH THAT.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.749
EDDIE, YOU FORCED
STEVE TO CHEAT.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.952
AND NOW WHEN HE NEEDS
YOU, YOU LEAVE HIM
HIGH AND DRY.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.420
EDDIE, STEVE WAS
A REAL FRIEND TO YOU.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.322
AND IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU RETURNED THE FAVOR.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.260
GOD, I LOVE YOU!

16:39.666 --> 16:41.368
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.136
THIS WHOLE THING
IS MY FAULT.

16:45.738 --> 16:49.309
TOMORROW MORNING, I'LL GO TO
PRINCIPAL SHIMATA'S OFFICE,

16:49.376 --> 16:52.579
AND I'LL TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.148
THANKS, EDDO.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.516
I KNEW
YOU'D COME THROUGH.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.691
Shh.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.070
A LITTLE SHOT
OF THIS GAS

17:17.137 --> 17:20.607
AND WINSLOW
WILL BE SLEEPING
LIKE A BABY.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.210
WHY ARE WE ROBBING
THE SAME PLACE TWICE?

17:23.276 --> 17:25.445
I THOUGHT
WE GOT EVERYTHING.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.915
HUMILIATION,
MY DIM-WITTED FRIEND.

17:28.981 --> 17:33.186
CARL WINSLOW NAILED ME
AT THE PEAK OF MY CAREER.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.687
YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN ME, NED.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.257
I WAS SLICK AND SINEWY.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.126
I COULD
SLIP THROUGH A HOUSE

17:39.192 --> 17:43.330
LIKE THREAD
THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.532
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
WHEN HOMES WERE
A LOT BIGGER, HUH?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.202
NICK, COME HERE.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.305
OW!

17:54.941 --> 17:57.744
CARL WINSLOW
RUINED MY LIFE.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.045
YOU KNOW
WHAT 12 LONG YEARS

17:59.112 --> 18:01.614
IN A FEDERAL PENITENTIARY
CAN DO TO A MAN?

18:01.681 --> 18:04.851
TURN HIM INTO A TWISTED,
DEMENTED SOCIOPATH
LIKE YOURSELF?

18:09.422 --> 18:10.290
HEY!

18:10.357 --> 18:12.392
I WAS A LEGEND ONCE,

18:12.459 --> 18:14.794
AND I COULD BE
A LEGEND AGAIN.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.763
YOU STICK WITH ME,
NED,

18:16.829 --> 18:20.167
AND ONE DAY
THEY'LL WRITE A SONG
ABOUT US.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.903
GEE, I HOPE
IT'S NOT RAP.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.238
I HATE RAP.

18:48.761 --> 18:49.629
DAD?

18:49.696 --> 18:50.597
HMM?

18:50.663 --> 18:51.964
CAN WE TALK TO YOU?

18:52.031 --> 18:54.567
SURE. SIT DOWN.
MAKE YOURSELVES
UNCOMFORTABLE.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.006
WHAT'S UP?

19:00.072 --> 19:01.974
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THIS IS EDDIE'S STORY.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.176
ALL YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME

19:03.243 --> 19:07.046
IS AN OCCASIONAL
"MM-HMM, THAT'S RIGHT."

19:07.113 --> 19:07.980
THAT'S ENOUGH, STEVE.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.316
MM-HMM,
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:12.685 --> 19:13.753
DAD...

19:13.820 --> 19:15.888
I DID SOMETHING
REALLY STUPID AT SCHOOL,

19:15.955 --> 19:18.325
AND I'M GOING
TO GET IN TROUBLE FOR IT.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.928
SO I THOUGHT I SHOULD LET YOU
KNOW ABOUT IT BEFORE YOU GET
A CALL FROM THE PRINCIPAL.

19:21.994 --> 19:26.065
UH-OH. THIS
SOUNDS SERIOUS.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.900
WHAT DID YOU DO?

19:27.967 --> 19:29.802
WELL, I...

19:29.869 --> 19:32.439
I...

19:32.505 --> 19:33.773
[YAWNS]

19:33.840 --> 19:36.042
I CHEATED ON MY TEST.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.477
MM-HMM...

19:37.544 --> 19:39.045
[YAWNS]

19:39.111 --> 19:40.380
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:42.882 --> 19:43.883
YOU CHEATED?

19:46.686 --> 19:47.787
DAD.

19:47.854 --> 19:48.855
YOU CHEATED?

19:54.060 --> 19:54.994
YES, SIR.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.397
EDWARD,
I CAN'T REMEMBER

19:57.464 --> 19:59.499
THE LAST TIME
I'VE BEEN SO ANGRY...

20:01.734 --> 20:02.802
AND SLEEPY.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.840
I'M SLEEPY, TOO.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.009
MM-HMM...

20:10.076 --> 20:11.444
THAT'S RIGHT.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.591
AND DON'T TRY ANYTHING,
OTHERWISE YOU'LL GET
ANOTHER TASTE OF MY SHOVEL.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.426
TAKE IT EASY.
I'M A BLEEDER.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.330
[GROANS]

20:30.397 --> 20:32.064
YOU CHEATED?

20:32.131 --> 20:33.366
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.773
GET OVER HERE!

20:42.275 --> 20:45.378
TERBIUM, 158.92 TB.

20:45.445 --> 20:48.815
TERBIUM, 158.92 TB.

20:48.881 --> 20:52.285
DYSPROSIUM, 162.50 DY.

20:52.352 --> 20:55.788
DYSPRO--DYS...
MAN, THIS--THIS STINKS.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.026
CAN'T WE TAKE A BREAK
FROM THIS CHEMISTRY
STUFF?

21:00.092 --> 21:01.728
NEGATORY, EDDO.

21:01.794 --> 21:05.197
NOW WE HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO RECITE THE PERIODIC TABLE
OF THE ELEMENTS

21:05.264 --> 21:07.667
BEFORE MR. SHIMATA
WILL LIFT OUR SUSPENSION.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.236
AND I WANT
TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.605
I SIMPLY CRAVE
ACADEMIC NOURISHMENT.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.577
NOW...WHERE WERE WE?

21:17.644 --> 21:20.880
AH, HOLMIUM,
MY PERSONAL FAVE...

21:20.947 --> 21:24.083
164.93 HO.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.753
169., UH, SOMETHING.

21:26.819 --> 21:27.887
NO!

21:32.892 --> 21:33.926
OKAY.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.800
OKAY. YEAH, PUT IT
RIGHT DOWN THERE.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.336
YEAH, TO THE LEFT
A LITTLE BIT.
YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.037
DROP IT.
THAT'S IT.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.839
THAT'S IT.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.741
OKAY.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.977
OH, GEE...

21:51.043 --> 21:52.345
THAT LOOKED HEAVY.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.150
GET HIM!

21:58.217 --> 21:59.786
GET HIM, RACHE,
GET HIM!
