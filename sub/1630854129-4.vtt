WEBVTT

00:04.656 --> 00:07.007
You're a lot of fun.
We should do this again.

00:07.050 --> 00:09.531
My niece is coming by.
Keep your distance.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.185
This is Tracy.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.317
- Nice to meet you.
- Same.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.450
Come help me convert the
laundry room into my office.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.191
- You're asking for my help.
- Yeah.

00:17.234 --> 00:19.541
But you didn't ask.
You gave an order.

00:19.584 --> 00:22.022
<i>For some reason,
Boden loves this guy.</i>

00:22.065 --> 00:24.937
So I got to do my best
to make it work.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.548
<i>You are my life.</i>

00:26.591 --> 00:30.465
<i>I wouldn't change
a second of that.</i>

00:30.508 --> 00:32.771
Watch your step!

00:32.815 --> 00:34.208
Get out, get out, get out!

00:34.251 --> 00:36.079
Please, God, please!

00:36.123 --> 00:39.343
Let them work.
I can save him. Please.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.216
No, no, no, no, no.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.751
Okay.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.750
Mateo's party's
at that bouncy place,

01:38.794 --> 01:41.144
and it's right after
the bug play at school,

01:41.188 --> 01:43.146
so maybe you can come?

01:43.190 --> 01:45.801
Uh, sounds like fun.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.063
When is the bug play?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.718
I told you, Friday.

01:49.761 --> 01:54.592
You know, that's a busy day
for me at work.

01:54.636 --> 01:57.813
But I promise you, I will try.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.906
I heard Mom on the phone.

02:03.949 --> 02:05.647
She said a chief died.

02:07.518 --> 02:11.870
Yeah, sadly, that's true.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.658
He was a good man.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.225
You're a chief.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.015
Look at me.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.757
I am safe and sound.

02:33.065 --> 02:36.156
You know what?

02:36.199 --> 02:38.984
I'm gonna make it
to that bug play.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.203
Don't you worry.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.380
Okay.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.818
Bye.

02:48.820 --> 02:49.778
I love you.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.877
Hey.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.444
Thought first shift was
supposed to stay out of there.

03:03.487 --> 03:07.665
Oh, uh, I'm Jonah,
the floater for second shift.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.189
New medic.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.757
Just doing my thing and
checking it all out, you know?

03:14.324 --> 03:18.110
So, uh, how's House 51?

03:18.154 --> 03:21.853
You hear things, you know,
like you guys are legendary,

03:21.897 --> 03:24.116
or something?

03:24.160 --> 03:25.205
To be honest,
I'm still trying

03:25.248 --> 03:27.859
to figure it all out myself.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.079
Good luck.

03:30.122 --> 03:32.342
Talk more later.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.736
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:34.779 --> 03:35.911
Mm.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.391
Is the floater as bad
as you thought?

03:37.434 --> 03:38.827
Ugh, worse.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.872
He's obsessed with manga, which,

03:40.916 --> 03:42.396
I have no idea
what that even is,

03:42.439 --> 03:44.876
but he's informed me
that Rengoku's death

03:44.920 --> 03:47.705
in "Demon Slayer: Mugen Train"
had to happen

03:47.749 --> 03:49.925
for the plot of the
"Demon Slayer" series to work,

03:49.968 --> 03:52.362
and he's pretty
worked up about it.

03:52.406 --> 03:53.929
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.236
I am not leaving the locker
room until the bells go off.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.804
Have you heard from Violet?

03:59.848 --> 04:02.981
Just a thank you text for my
messages after the funeral--

04:03.025 --> 04:04.940
very brief.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.071
You?

04:06.115 --> 04:07.290
Same.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.466
The funeral was heartbreaking.

04:09.510 --> 04:12.991
That speech Evan's big brother
gave almost killed me.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.732
I wish there was more
we could do for her.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.081
I know.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.040
I did have a thought
about a couple things

04:18.083 --> 04:20.695
we could send to her place,
maybe cheer her up a little.

04:20.738 --> 04:21.957
Yeah, I like
the sound of that.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.264
<i>Ambulance 61, Squad 3,</i>

04:24.307 --> 04:27.310
<i>person trapped, Oakwood Beach.</i>

04:56.644 --> 04:58.733
He says his son was
playing in the pile,

04:58.776 --> 05:00.604
digging a big hole,
and the sides collapsed--

05:00.648 --> 05:02.476
a little eight-year-old boy.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.178
Hey, we can't use tools.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.353
Move aside.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.441
Nico, hang in there, buddy.

05:31.722 --> 05:36.118
Backboards, ground pads,
forms and shovels--let's go.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.773
Yeah, copy that, Lieutenant.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.078
- How deep was he?
- I don't know.

05:40.122 --> 05:43.473
Like 3, maybe, 4 feet.

05:43.517 --> 05:44.474
Chief?

05:44.518 --> 05:47.303
Box him in, right here.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.174
Hey, I'm gonna need you
to wait down there.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.352
Off the pile.

05:59.489 --> 06:02.274
All right, squad, drive them
in as deep as you can.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.150
Let's move, guys.

06:14.025 --> 06:16.376
Got him!
- Nico!

06:16.419 --> 06:17.507
It's just his hand so far.
Stand by.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.162
Get this sand out of here!

06:23.774 --> 06:26.516
I got his head.
I got his head.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.909
Uncovering his head now.

06:27.952 --> 06:30.215
Here, bring the oxygen tank
up to him.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.216
Cruz, can you get
that mask on him?

06:31.260 --> 06:33.044
Yeah, you got it.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.351
It's all right.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.570
Is he breathing?

06:41.270 --> 06:42.837
Is he breathing?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.447
Look, they have to get all
that heavy sand off his chest

06:44.491 --> 06:46.406
before they get him
breathing, okay?

06:50.540 --> 06:52.586
How long was he under there?
- I don't know.

06:52.629 --> 06:55.371
Uh, maybe seven minutes.

07:00.463 --> 07:01.638
Breathe.

07:05.337 --> 07:06.382
Breathe.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.172
Breathe.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.655
- Cruz, go and take over!
- Captain!

07:18.699 --> 07:20.222
Hey--hey, sir!

07:20.265 --> 07:21.266
We'll bring him to you, okay?

07:21.310 --> 07:22.311
Just give us a minute.

07:22.354 --> 07:25.053
Nico, I'm here, buddy.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.446
Nico!

07:30.101 --> 07:31.973
Chief?

07:32.016 --> 07:33.975
Chief--Chief, come on.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.238
Come on, take a break.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.413
You did good.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.076
Got him.

07:48.119 --> 07:49.164
Nico?

08:08.488 --> 08:09.967
One, two, three.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.685
- What's that?
- See for yourself.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.382
It just showed up at Molly's.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.953
The estate trust
of Spiro Stephanides.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.955
That the crazy old dude
who used to own the bar?

08:40.998 --> 08:42.260
Yeah, I guess he
wasn't lying when he said

08:42.304 --> 08:43.610
he was on his way out.

08:43.653 --> 08:46.787
Or when he hinted that
we'd be named in the will.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.761
A beer mug?

09:04.805 --> 09:08.809
Technically a stein,
but yeah.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.027
That's it.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.812
That's the extent
of our bequeathal--

09:11.855 --> 09:15.511
a piece of bric-a-brac,
a Bavarian gewgaw.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.904
Hey, could have been worse.

09:16.947 --> 09:20.603
I was half expecting
a monkey's paw.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.432
What a crazy old coot he was.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.348
Oh, gross.

09:26.391 --> 09:29.307
I wouldn't drink out of this
for, like, 1,000 bucks.

09:29.351 --> 09:33.703
Well, Donnelly just spent an
hour explaining how

09:33.747 --> 09:36.793
Muichiro is
the strongest Hashira.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.447
Oh, come on,
he's messing with you.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.318
Muichiro is just
the Mist Hashira.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.669
I don't get it.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.366
Any word on when
Violet's back?

09:44.409 --> 09:45.672
I sent her a couple
of texts today

09:45.715 --> 09:47.543
just so she knows
I'm thinking of her.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.849
Yeah, I sent her
a bunch of messages too.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.502
She hasn't gotten back to me.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.722
Me and Cindy,
we packed up some dinners.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.420
We left it with the super
of her building

09:55.464 --> 09:56.944
since she didn't
answer the door.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.859
I'm sure
she appreciates it all,

09:58.902 --> 10:00.904
but she just needs
some solo time right now--

10:00.948 --> 10:03.646
not feeling up for visits
or coming back to work yet.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.823
But last I heard, she's gonna
get a good long furlough.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.314
Hey, Chief,
you want me to finish

10:19.357 --> 10:21.664
hosing all that down for you?

10:21.708 --> 10:23.666
I'm almost done. Thanks.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.538
You were, uh--

10:26.582 --> 10:28.149
you were half man,
half machine out there

10:28.192 --> 10:29.716
on that beach, Chief.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.456
It was pretty incredible.

10:33.328 --> 10:34.938
Had to get that boy out.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.161
No other option.

10:43.381 --> 10:44.644
Well, you did.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.608
We did.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
Great team effort.

11:36.521 --> 11:39.786
Carver,
got a little job for you.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.178
Great.

11:41.222 --> 11:43.920
It's time to repaint
the compartment interiors.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.182
Okay.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.015
You still got 12 hours
till the end of shift.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.496
12 hours to tackle what,
20 compartments

11:54.539 --> 11:57.064
that I have to empty out,
paint, repack.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.806
Well, you scrub first,
then paint.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.155
And Gallo can't
pitch in because--

12:01.198 --> 12:03.200
Because, Carver,
it is your turn.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.597
Lieutenant, am I being
punished for something?

12:08.640 --> 12:10.294
No.

12:10.338 --> 12:13.036
But once you are finished,
you will know

12:13.080 --> 12:15.212
how the truck is organized,
forwards and backwards.

12:16.474 --> 12:17.606
Great.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.067
It's outside
visiting hours, hon.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.590
Oh, uh, I know.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.244
I'm a medic.
- Ah.

12:49.377 --> 12:52.641
Are you a relative
of Gabriel Hammond's?

12:52.684 --> 12:54.904
Uh, no. No.

12:54.948 --> 12:58.603
My--my boyfriend, Evan, was a--
was a paramedic chief.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.475
And he tried to save Gabriel.

13:00.518 --> 13:03.739
He sheltered him when the
building collapsed, but...

13:03.783 --> 13:07.743
Um, Evan
didn't make it out, so.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.354
Very sorry to hear that.

13:10.398 --> 13:13.836
So I've been, um, visiting
him during the off hours

13:13.880 --> 13:15.359
pretty much every day
since Gabriel came in.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.759
The neurological exams
just haven't changed

13:23.803 --> 13:25.152
since he got here.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.501
I know.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.329
And I know the doctors
say he may not make it,

13:28.372 --> 13:32.333
but I don't believe that.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.378
He has to pull through.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.641
Has to.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.948
Otherwise...

13:38.992 --> 13:41.255
what did Evan die for?

13:50.568 --> 13:52.570
Hey, look at that,

13:52.614 --> 13:54.181
second shift repainting
the compartments.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.183
One side, anyway.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.359
I'll have to hit
the other side next shift.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.665
Unless you guys want
to take care of it.

14:00.709 --> 14:01.841
What do you say, Jacobs?

14:01.884 --> 14:04.669
I say, no thanks.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.323
Can't say I blame you.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.977
How's all that going?

14:08.021 --> 14:09.152
Just fine.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.893
If you need a hand
next shift--

14:10.937 --> 14:13.461
Thanks, but Lieutenant
was pretty clear

14:13.504 --> 14:15.767
she doesn't want you helping.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.595
What's her deal anyway?

14:17.639 --> 14:19.684
How do you mean?

14:19.728 --> 14:21.904
I just get the feeling she's
riding my ass for no reason,

14:21.948 --> 14:24.951
and I'm wondering if it's
the kind of thing she does

14:24.994 --> 14:27.301
a lot, a power play, you know?

14:27.344 --> 14:30.826
If she's making you do
something, there's a reason.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.394
What's the story
with her and Severide?

14:33.437 --> 14:35.613
They've been together
a long time?

14:35.657 --> 14:36.832
Yeah.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.703
Why?

14:38.747 --> 14:39.748
Just curious.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.057
Kidd's as good a lieutenant
as you'll find anywhere.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.757
See you next shift, Carver.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.074
Everything okay
with your son?

15:01.117 --> 15:02.249
Oh, yes.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.599
Yeah, Nico's doing great.

15:04.642 --> 15:07.776
Already back home
all because of you.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.691
Yeah.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.214
Rob Scanlon.

15:11.258 --> 15:12.650
Chief Wallace Boden.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.740
It's an honor to shake
your hand, Chief Boden.

15:15.784 --> 15:20.049
Man, uh, the words thank you
just don't seem like enough

15:20.093 --> 15:21.964
for saving my boy's life.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.010
I'm just glad he's okay.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.359
I have a boy about
the same age.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.448
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

15:32.279 --> 15:35.412
I tried to dig, you know,
to get him out.

15:35.456 --> 15:38.241
And, uh, I was going
as hard as I could.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.764
But the more I dug,
it looked like the deeper

15:39.808 --> 15:42.550
I was burying him.

15:42.593 --> 15:46.946
You did the right thing
letting us take over.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.469
It's what we train for.

15:50.253 --> 15:53.300
I just felt so helpless.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.304
Worst feeling in the world when
it comes to your kids, right?

15:57.347 --> 15:59.088
Yes, it is.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.655
I've been feeling it
a lot lately too.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.526
You know,
I moved Nico to Chicago

16:02.570 --> 16:04.702
right when COVID hit the fan
for a new job.

16:04.746 --> 16:07.531
He was online for school
for two years--

16:07.575 --> 16:08.968
no real way to make friends.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.970
So, you know, he's--

16:11.013 --> 16:13.059
he's been lonely.

16:13.102 --> 16:15.278
And I try to spend as much time
as I can with him,

16:15.322 --> 16:19.152
but, you know, the job
just has me running.

16:20.849 --> 16:23.808
The beach day was our
first outing in a while.

16:23.852 --> 16:24.809
Believe that?

16:24.853 --> 16:26.246
I'm sorry.

16:26.289 --> 16:29.031
I understand what it is
that you're going through.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.555
Sometimes it seems impossible
to balance it all.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.558
Very true.

16:36.604 --> 16:41.130
Well, hmm, here I am taking up
even more of your time.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.392
No.

16:42.436 --> 16:43.828
I'll let you get back to it.

16:43.872 --> 16:48.050
But, uh, again,

16:48.094 --> 16:50.357
thank you, Chief.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.822
Can I come in?

17:20.865 --> 17:25.696
I'm really bad company
right now, but...

17:41.016 --> 17:44.846
Let me guess, Stella is stuck
working at Molly's,

17:44.889 --> 17:46.108
so she sent you
to bring me a beer

17:46.152 --> 17:47.457
and try to cheer me up?

17:47.501 --> 17:50.243
No. This is my idea.

17:51.896 --> 17:55.074
I wanted to tell you
about a girlfriend I had

17:55.117 --> 17:57.032
before your time at 51, Anna.

18:00.688 --> 18:01.993
Yeah.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.821
Stella has told me about her.

18:03.865 --> 18:07.216
I mean, I don't know much,
but I--

18:07.260 --> 18:09.479
I know she died.

18:12.047 --> 18:15.572
The two toughest things
I've ever been through

18:15.616 --> 18:18.488
were losing Shay
and losing her.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.714
And for the longest time

18:26.757 --> 18:31.588
after Anna died, I felt like

18:31.632 --> 18:33.851
a boat cut loose from the dock,

18:33.895 --> 18:37.464
just lost,
nothing to hold on to.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.423
Yeah, that's--

18:40.467 --> 18:43.296
yeah, that's pretty much
exactly it.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.478
I don't like to think about
how low a bottom

18:51.521 --> 18:54.437
I might have hit
if I hadn't gone back to work.

18:56.135 --> 19:01.140
That's just my take,
having been where you are.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.751
I appreciate it, I really do.

19:03.794 --> 19:07.146
But the--

19:07.189 --> 19:08.538
the difference is...

19:10.975 --> 19:13.456
I'm scared
if I go back to work,

19:13.500 --> 19:15.980
I'll see Evan everywhere.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.504
It was his work too.

19:20.811 --> 19:24.163
You can't avoid it that way,
I'm sorry to say.

19:24.206 --> 19:30.734
I saw Anna wherever I went,
too, for the longest time.

19:30.778 --> 19:34.608
But what I saw even clearer,
right in front of me,

19:34.651 --> 19:37.828
was my crew at 51,

19:37.872 --> 19:40.657
always bugging me,
checking in on me.

19:40.701 --> 19:46.663
And I wanted to kill them
half the time.

19:46.707 --> 19:53.409
But I knew that
if I started to drift,

19:53.453 --> 19:54.541
they'd hold on tight.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.292
I mean, I guess it's better
than that old dog mug

20:06.335 --> 20:07.510
we used to have.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.208
Man, that thing
bummed me out.

20:09.251 --> 20:12.123
I figured Stephanides
didn't leave us this stein

20:12.167 --> 20:14.648
so we could shove it
in the back of the cabinet.

20:14.691 --> 20:17.346
We gotta honor
a dying man's wishes, right?

20:17.390 --> 20:19.522
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah?

20:19.566 --> 20:20.784
Listen, I've been doing
a little digging,

20:20.828 --> 20:23.526
and that stein is, like,
a collector's item.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.180
- Get out.
- No. For real.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.616
These things are all over eBay.

20:26.660 --> 20:30.054
And I think I found one
that looks pretty similar.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.231
It dates back to 1892.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.536
No way.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.059
"Depicting
the ancient Germanic myth

20:35.103 --> 20:36.539
of Brunhilda and Sigurd."

20:36.583 --> 20:38.498
Ooh, good to know.

20:38.541 --> 20:42.502
Herrmann, it sold
for almost $9,000.

20:42.545 --> 20:43.981
- What?
- Whoa.

20:46.332 --> 20:50.640
Oh, hey, Ritter,

20:50.684 --> 20:52.686
how fast do you think
that you could get

20:52.729 --> 20:55.079
this thing listed for sale?
- Me?

20:55.123 --> 20:56.777
What happened to honoring
a dying man's wishes?

20:56.820 --> 20:58.561
We'll honor him
with a new double pump

20:58.605 --> 21:00.737
glycol draft beer chiller.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.086
Our ship has come in.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.436
Yeah.

21:03.479 --> 21:04.741
Hey, Blake,
ready for another?

21:04.785 --> 21:06.656
Uh, hey, Tracy, no.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.093
Uh, no, I'm good.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.181
Really?

21:11.879 --> 21:14.055
Why do I feel like
you're trying to get rid of me?

21:14.098 --> 21:15.099
What are you doing?

21:15.143 --> 21:16.449
Uncle Christopher's
right there.

21:16.492 --> 21:19.321
Uncle Christopher
doesn't care.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.540
What don't I care about?

21:24.108 --> 21:26.067
Yeah, Molly's.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.286
Oh, hey, Trudy, yeah.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.766
Mouch is right in front of me.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.507
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, sure.

21:31.551 --> 21:33.204
Uh, hang on.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.424
Um, she doesn't
want to talk to you.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.165
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

21:39.385 --> 21:43.780
Kidd, it's Trudy, for you.

21:43.824 --> 21:46.261
Hey, lady, what's going on?

21:49.917 --> 21:53.050
He was picked up in West Town
on a drunk and disorderly,

21:53.094 --> 21:56.053
with a case to be made
for assault,

21:56.097 --> 22:00.188
except nobody's willing
to press charges.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.321
And here we are.

22:05.411 --> 22:08.109
He one of yours?

22:08.152 --> 22:10.198
Evening, Lieutenant.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.855
Yeah, he belongs to me.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.422
Mm-hmm.

22:16.465 --> 22:19.642
If you barf in my car, I'm
dumping you on the Eisenhower.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.340
You don't have
to worry about me.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.777
I sobered up real quick
when I saw your scowling face.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.648
Do not get cute.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.650
If you think that
you can go carousing,

22:27.694 --> 22:29.696
getting into trouble,
and then drop my name

22:29.739 --> 22:32.351
when the cops show up,
you better think twice.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.832
I didn't drop your name,
or I didn't mean to.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.965
I just made a crack
about how Lieutenant Kidd

22:38.008 --> 22:39.923
was gonna bury me
if I didn't show up for shift.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.969
I didn't know the desk sergeant
had you on speed dial.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.798
Don't you have
anyone else at all

22:44.841 --> 22:46.495
that you could have called
to come and bail you out?

22:46.539 --> 22:48.367
Any friends at all?

22:48.410 --> 22:49.368
I got friends.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.847
Do you?

22:50.891 --> 22:53.546
Or are you just some
kind of train wreck?

22:56.462 --> 22:58.377
Listen, Lieutenant,

22:58.420 --> 23:01.771
for all 24 hours
of every shift, you own my ass.

23:01.815 --> 23:04.774
But when I punch out,
that's my time.

23:04.818 --> 23:07.864
What I do, who I am,
that's my business.

23:07.908 --> 23:09.692
All you need to worry about
is who shows up

23:09.736 --> 23:12.216
when I punch back in.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.914
And that's the best
firefighter you ever saw.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.133
Sure.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.613
Get in the car.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.495
Morning, Lieutenant.

23:29.538 --> 23:31.279
Came in a little early to get
started on the driver's side--

23:31.322 --> 23:33.020
should be able to finish
it all this shift.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.765
How's the lip?

23:38.808 --> 23:41.724
It's nothing--totally fine.

23:41.768 --> 23:46.468
You know, your accent really
comes out when you're drunk.

23:46.512 --> 23:49.471
What is that? Texas?

23:49.515 --> 23:51.342
Listen, Lieutenant, you don't
need to mention anything

23:51.386 --> 23:54.128
to Boden about my little
misadventure, do you?

23:54.171 --> 23:55.172
It doesn't seem like
the kind of thing

23:55.216 --> 23:56.609
he needs to be bothered with.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.181
How about you worry
about those compartments,

24:04.225 --> 24:06.619
you let me worry about
how to do my job.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.371
Morning.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.591
Yeah, morning.

24:36.213 --> 24:39.216
Oh, my God, you're here.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.567
Hi.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.439
Violet, damn, girl.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.615
- She's mine!
- Man, it's good to see you.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.748
Like, so seriously good.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.533
Oh, my God, we really
missed you around here.

24:51.577 --> 24:52.969
It feels like
you've been gone for months.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.102
Thanks, you guys.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.104
I'm so glad
you feel ready to be back.

24:57.147 --> 25:02.065
Yeah, I think I am.
Or at least, I hope so.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.633
Well, don't worry,
we've got you.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.200
Yeah.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.858
Morning, Chief.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.990
Yeah, I suppose.

25:14.034 --> 25:15.383
I know that mood.

25:15.426 --> 25:18.168
It comes when you don't
get good sleep.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.257
Little Kenny is the same way.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.172
I'm not sure
I appreciate the comparison,

25:22.216 --> 25:23.391
but yeah, you're right.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.523
I was up late.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.873
Can't stop thinking
about that father

25:26.916 --> 25:29.702
from the beach call, Rob,

25:29.745 --> 25:33.532
way he was blaming himself
for his kid's struggles.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.361
I have the same guilt,

25:37.405 --> 25:41.104
that I'm not there enough
for Terrance,

25:41.148 --> 25:42.584
or in the right way.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.064
I hear that.

25:44.107 --> 25:47.937
I got too many kids,
too little time.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.069
Yeah, but we're lucky, though.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.940
You know, we're firefighters.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.594
We got an eye on each
other's kids too.

25:52.638 --> 25:55.162
Like, Harvey was so happy to
meet up with you and Terrance

25:55.205 --> 25:58.034
the other day,
just dads and boys together.

25:58.078 --> 26:01.472
Hey, me and my kids
weren't invited?

26:01.516 --> 26:02.778
Okay, look,
I'm sorry, Herrmann,

26:02.822 --> 26:04.780
but Javi's scared of Annabelle.

26:04.824 --> 26:07.609
So? Who isn't?

26:07.653 --> 26:10.569
Herrmann, get in here.
You got to see this.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.095
Just--
- What's happening?

26:15.138 --> 26:16.400
Hurry up.
The snipers are descending.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.098
- What? Snipers?
- Yeah.

26:18.141 --> 26:19.882
Uh, the real action
with an eBay sale

26:19.926 --> 26:21.231
happens right at the end.

26:21.275 --> 26:23.190
That's when the bidders
try to snipe one another

26:23.233 --> 26:24.452
with a last second bid.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.759
And they're
sniping like crazy.

26:26.802 --> 26:27.760
Where are we at?

26:27.803 --> 26:29.196
Up to $5,000.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.372
- Oh, man.
- 5,500.

26:31.415 --> 26:33.200
- Now 6,000.
- Oh, 6,500.

26:33.243 --> 26:35.768
Oh, is this real?

26:35.811 --> 26:37.944
You guys aren't pulling some
kind of prank on me, yeah?

26:37.987 --> 26:39.423
What?

26:39.467 --> 26:40.773
7,000.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.557
Ooh.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.038
- Herrmann, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:45.081 --> 26:47.562
I just got--whew.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.433
A few seconds left
and still climbing.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.305
Yeah, this is--
this is when the bots

26:51.348 --> 26:52.567
should start kicking in.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.003
There's bots now?

26:54.047 --> 26:56.179
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- This is insane.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.399
- Holy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:58.442 --> 27:02.185
Holy crow.

27:02.229 --> 27:05.101
- What? What happened?
- Final sale price--

27:05.145 --> 27:06.755
12 grand.

27:06.799 --> 27:10.498
$12,000 for a musty beer
stein--not too shabby.

27:10.541 --> 27:13.240
I'm sorry, did you hear
what he just said?

27:13.283 --> 27:15.851
You made $12,000.

27:22.162 --> 27:24.555
<i>Ambulance 61,
person in distress,</i>

27:24.599 --> 27:28.690
<i>21466 North Lincoln Park West.</i>

27:31.737 --> 27:33.042
- Ready?
- Let's do this.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.696
Ooh.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.220
- What took you so long?
- It was only--

27:37.264 --> 27:39.092
My husband, David,
you have to help him.

27:39.135 --> 27:40.528
He's so out of it.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.138
He was talking about
how his chest hurt.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.532
And then, he just
got all weird, like--

27:44.575 --> 27:46.055
like he didn't
know where he was.

27:46.099 --> 27:48.014
- David, can you hear me?
- David? David?

27:48.057 --> 27:49.493
He was awake a second ago.

27:49.537 --> 27:50.930
Does your husband have
any history of heart trouble?

27:50.973 --> 27:52.758
Yes, totally--he just
got back from the hospital

27:52.801 --> 27:55.848
a couple of days ago
after open-heart surgery.

27:55.891 --> 27:57.197
Blood pressure's really low.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.677
Heart sounds are muffled.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.115
- Brett.
- JVD.

28:02.158 --> 28:03.464
- What's that mean?
- Your husband has a tamponade,

28:03.507 --> 28:04.552
which means blood
is building up in the space

28:04.595 --> 28:06.075
between the heart
and pericardium.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.077
His wound's opening up.
We gotta get him to Med fast.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.123
Blood pressure that low,
he won't make it.

28:10.166 --> 28:13.039
We need to reduce
that fluid buildup now.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.693
Are you sure, Vi?

28:14.736 --> 28:16.564
I've seen CT surgeons
do this in the ER.

28:16.607 --> 28:17.696
We got this.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.804
What did you do to him?

28:38.847 --> 28:40.283
I know this looks scary,
but this is good.

28:40.327 --> 28:41.937
Releasing the blood is exactly
what we needed to happen.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.417
His blood pressure's
already coming up.

28:43.460 --> 28:46.115
She just saved his life.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.856
David?

28:47.900 --> 28:48.770
Baby?

28:51.381 --> 28:52.948
Gentle. Gentle.

28:54.515 --> 28:57.736
Up and over. Careful.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.781
You'll be okay, baby.

28:59.825 --> 29:00.826
Okay.
Now we need to move fast.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.131
Let's get him to the hospital.

29:02.175 --> 29:04.699
Let's go.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.919
So then,
he has the nerve to tell me

29:06.962 --> 29:08.747
that I shouldn't mention
anything to Boden

29:08.790 --> 29:11.837
about his little misadventure.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.101
He told you or asked you?

29:15.144 --> 29:17.016
I mean, it may have been
phrased as a question,

29:17.059 --> 29:19.105
but the implication was,
don't rat me out,

29:19.148 --> 29:20.802
like I'm supposed
to help Carver

29:20.846 --> 29:23.718
cover up his conduct unbecoming.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.025
So did you report it
to Boden?

29:26.068 --> 29:29.289
I wasn't planning on it until
Carver opened up his mouth.

29:29.332 --> 29:32.945
Now I'm thinking,
maybe I should loop Boden in.

29:32.988 --> 29:34.076
Hmm.

29:34.120 --> 29:38.080
Well, now's your chance.
Here he is.

29:38.124 --> 29:39.473
Hey, Chief.

29:39.516 --> 29:40.822
Severide, Kidd.

29:44.565 --> 29:45.696
Is everything okay?

29:48.569 --> 29:50.571
Yes, fine.

29:52.051 --> 29:53.966
I saw Carver out there
getting up close

29:54.009 --> 29:56.577
and personal with the truck.

29:56.620 --> 29:57.752
How's he working out?

30:00.799 --> 30:05.107
So far, so good.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.587
Yeah.

30:13.159 --> 30:14.073
All right, then.

30:17.598 --> 30:21.341
Don't start.

30:21.384 --> 30:25.214
I'm also gonna need a half
dozen ball lock disconnects,

30:25.258 --> 30:29.305
a half dozen keg couplers,
and 50 feet of beer line.

30:29.349 --> 30:30.829
Hey, am I forgetting anything?

30:30.872 --> 30:32.308
- Regulator.
- Oh, right.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.571
Hey, Ronnie, what do you got
in the way of,

30:34.615 --> 30:36.486
uh, you know,
secondary regulators?

30:36.530 --> 30:37.836
Uh-huh.

30:37.879 --> 30:40.360
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

30:40.403 --> 30:42.971
All right.
Let's go with the five way.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.886
And, uh, don't give me
any of that

30:44.930 --> 30:46.235
cheap zinc crap, all right.

30:46.279 --> 30:47.671
Give me the good stuff.

30:47.715 --> 30:50.109
What do you care about
where the money comes from?

30:50.152 --> 30:51.937
Maybe we knocked over
an armored truck, all right.

30:51.980 --> 30:54.591
Just give me the total. Mm-hmm.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.158
He can install
everything tomorrow.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.291
- Perfect.
- All right. Great.

30:58.334 --> 30:59.770
Ah.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.207
Yeah, we will have
the check waiting,

31:01.250 --> 31:03.296
and we will see you then.

31:03.339 --> 31:04.427
All right.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.429
We're in business!
- Oh!

31:06.473 --> 31:07.909
Oh!

31:07.953 --> 31:10.259
Oh, jeez!

31:10.303 --> 31:15.264
Herrmann, it's called
situational awareness.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.700
I'm sorry, brother.

31:16.744 --> 31:18.615
That was a hell
of a catch, though.

31:23.925 --> 31:27.233
Are we maybe being a little
too heartless, you know,

31:27.276 --> 31:31.019
hocking a gift from the dead
for cold hard cash?

31:31.063 --> 31:32.760
It's a little late
to grow a conscience.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.675
You just spent the money.

31:34.718 --> 31:35.850
Yeah.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.812
Do we have any left over?

31:41.856 --> 31:44.119
Maybe we throw a little
memorial type thing

31:44.163 --> 31:47.818
and pay our respects
to the old-timer that way.

31:47.862 --> 31:51.300
- Nice idea.
- Yeah.

31:51.344 --> 31:53.694
He was in damn good shape
when we dropped him off.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.783
That was something,
you cutting those wires.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.132
You thought I was crazy.

31:57.176 --> 32:00.179
No, I was just
being cautious.

32:00.222 --> 32:03.312
Too cautious,
because you were so right.

32:03.356 --> 32:04.618
You nailed it.

32:04.661 --> 32:05.619
Thanks, PIC.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.231
Oh, I can't believe this.

32:09.275 --> 32:10.406
What?

32:10.450 --> 32:11.842
Uh, it's the nurse at Med.

32:11.886 --> 32:13.627
She says that Gabriel Evans'
victim, he's--

32:13.670 --> 32:15.368
he's out of the coma.

32:15.411 --> 32:16.935
Oh, my God. Hey, hold on.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.649
I don't know why
it didn't occur to me

32:35.692 --> 32:37.999
that his family would be there.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.218
Of course they are.

32:42.090 --> 32:45.615
Maybe you could go in
and introduce yourself.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.966
No, I--

32:48.009 --> 32:50.403
I don't even know
what I was gonna say.

32:50.446 --> 32:53.362
But I am sure as hell
not gonna interrupt

32:53.406 --> 32:55.843
that beautiful scene.

32:55.886 --> 32:57.236
Look at that.

33:00.761 --> 33:02.850
Evan saved him, Sylvie.

33:06.506 --> 33:08.464
Yes, he did.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.658
It's end of shift.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.965
Isn't there a bar fight
waiting for you somewhere?

33:31.009 --> 33:33.272
Just staying
till this paint is dry,

33:33.315 --> 33:34.447
then I'll go raise hell.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.627
It's not bad work, Carver.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.498
- Thanks, Lieutenant.
- Yeah.

33:42.542 --> 33:45.458
And thanks for not
reporting me to Boden.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.158
Yet.

33:50.202 --> 33:51.942
Yet?

33:51.986 --> 33:53.944
I don't need Boden
to put you on notice.

33:53.988 --> 33:55.859
I already did that myself.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.731
But if I get
another call from PD

33:57.774 --> 34:03.084
or so much as catch a whiff
of mischief coming off of you,

34:03.128 --> 34:04.259
I'll make him aware of it.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.265
Look, that guy you found
in the cooler the other night,

34:10.309 --> 34:12.137
you don't have to
worry about him.

34:12.180 --> 34:14.269
This is the guy who's gonna
show up at the firehouse,

34:14.313 --> 34:15.575
shift after shift.

34:15.618 --> 34:16.750
The best firefighter.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.578
The best firefighter
that I ever saw.

34:20.928 --> 34:22.756
You said that already.

34:22.799 --> 34:25.019
I did? When?

34:25.063 --> 34:27.935
Look, just stay out
of trouble, Carver.

34:30.633 --> 34:34.985
Hey, Chief, see you
at our Molly's event later?

34:35.029 --> 34:36.422
Actually, no.

34:36.465 --> 34:38.163
Give my apologies
to Herrmann, would you?

34:38.206 --> 34:39.468
Sure thing.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.173
Hey.

34:48.216 --> 34:49.565
You have a minute?

34:49.609 --> 34:51.089
Yeah, I have
a whole bunch of them.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.264
Come on in.

35:04.798 --> 35:09.629
How do you live
with that hole in your heart,

35:09.672 --> 35:14.634
feeling that every part
of you is empty?

35:17.898 --> 35:18.812
Yeah.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.773
I'm no expert in grief,
that's for sure.

35:25.862 --> 35:31.607
But my feeling is, all you
can do is think of them,

35:31.651 --> 35:35.133
talk about them as much
as you can,

35:35.176 --> 35:36.743
so in some way...

35:39.702 --> 35:42.009
It's like they're still here.

36:03.944 --> 36:06.642
Time me--I'll get up there
so fast, it'll set a record.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.992
I'm gonna touch
that tippy top blue one.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.211
Me too.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.691
It's not about how fast
you get up there.

36:11.734 --> 36:13.258
Yeah, just take it
nice and easy,

36:13.301 --> 36:14.520
at least the first time,
all right?

36:14.563 --> 36:15.869
Okay, you two,
you got half an hour.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.350
Donna is putting together
a dinner for us all.

36:18.393 --> 36:19.525
She don't cook often.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.179
Like, never.

36:21.222 --> 36:22.441
Hey, go on, get.

36:31.624 --> 36:34.061
- Look at that.
- Hey!

36:34.104 --> 36:37.586
The inaugural pint from our
new and improved tap system.

36:37.630 --> 36:40.198
The first one might taste
a little metallic,

36:40.241 --> 36:43.201
but that'll go away.

36:43.244 --> 36:47.466
Now, four words you'll never
hear me say again--

36:49.207 --> 36:50.599
Drinks on the house.

36:57.911 --> 37:01.262
I'm--I'm kind of surprised
Carver isn't here.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.003
You sure he knew
it was happening?

37:03.046 --> 37:06.920
He was right there when
Herrmann invited everyone.

37:16.103 --> 37:17.757
Where'd that come from?

37:17.800 --> 37:22.240
From me, knowing what a
difference you made to Violet,

37:22.283 --> 37:23.763
getting her back to work.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.202
It wasn't just me.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.247
It was everyone.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.292
I knew you would say that.

37:31.336 --> 37:36.515
One of the many reasons
you are my perfect man.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.958
Maybe she's right, you know,

37:45.001 --> 37:46.568
maybe Herrmann doesn't care
if you two are dating.

37:46.612 --> 37:48.614
- Hanging out.
- Uh-huh.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.659
I mean, what is he gonna do?
She's a grown-ass woman.

37:50.703 --> 37:52.270
That she is.

37:52.313 --> 37:54.402
You know, it would be nice
to keep it going while we can

37:54.446 --> 37:57.449
'cause that girl is F-U-N, fun.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.061
Here you go.

38:01.104 --> 38:03.324
Thanks, Tracy.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.631
You value your life, Capp?

38:05.674 --> 38:07.937
Keep your distance.

38:12.899 --> 38:15.597
Ladies and gents,
here's to Stephanides,

38:15.641 --> 38:18.078
who's served us well.

38:18.121 --> 38:21.211
Let's hope he's in heaven
and not in hell.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.751
What's going on here?

38:38.794 --> 38:43.495
Stephanides, but you're not--

38:43.538 --> 38:45.018
I mean--

38:46.759 --> 38:48.282
We got your beer stein.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.544
Great!

38:49.588 --> 38:51.372
That's why I'm here,
to pick it up.

38:51.416 --> 38:54.027
She's a beaut, isn't she?
- Yeah.

38:54.070 --> 38:56.377
And I had them ship it
to my old business address

38:56.421 --> 38:59.337
because of tax purposes.

38:59.380 --> 39:00.381
Where is it?

39:00.425 --> 39:03.384
I'm dying to see it in person.

39:03.428 --> 39:04.603
Well--

39:06.779 --> 39:10.391
That's him, Evan.

39:13.089 --> 39:16.484
He was the only one who saw you
fall out of that door

39:16.528 --> 39:18.921
overcome with smoke.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.533
And, um,

39:21.576 --> 39:23.143
he knew he was
supposed to stay out

39:23.186 --> 39:25.580
of the collapse zone,
but he could see

39:25.624 --> 39:28.148
you weren't gonna
make it out on your own.

39:28.191 --> 39:32.152
So he ran in to help.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.633
That is a brave man.

39:40.726 --> 39:43.859
Is it okay if, um--

39:43.903 --> 39:46.558
can I tell you a little bit
about who he was?

39:46.601 --> 39:50.562
Yes, I'd like that very much.

39:56.959 --> 40:00.572
Evan was the kind of guy--

40:08.841 --> 40:10.756
Evan was the kind of guy
who could make someone

40:10.799 --> 40:14.934
feel like the center
of the universe...

40:18.807 --> 40:23.769
And was worth
risking everything for.
