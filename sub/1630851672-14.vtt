WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:02.281
I thought you said the crater
was filled with walkers.

00:03.891 --> 00:05.849
Somebody let them out.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.677
Ofelia's alive.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.070
You told me she was dead.

00:09.201 --> 00:10.941
I know, because that's
what I thought.

00:11.072 --> 00:12.465
Strand has her in the tower.

00:14.293 --> 00:16.425
Do you really care about
protecting Strand?

00:16.556 --> 00:18.079
I care about surviving.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.777
Gotta to get Mo as far away
from here as possible.

00:20.908 --> 00:22.301
Good luck, right?

00:24.738 --> 00:26.783
We gotta move.

00:26.914 --> 00:28.133
Follow me.

01:09.609 --> 01:12.438
S-Sir.
Alicia's here for you.

01:15.049 --> 01:17.356
Divine providence.

01:25.451 --> 01:27.670
What happened to you?

01:27.801 --> 01:30.847
There are days when one
must swipe the slate clean, Wes.

01:30.978 --> 01:33.328
Today is
one of them.

01:33.459 --> 01:35.200
She didn't come alone.

01:39.856 --> 01:41.597
The gang's all here.

01:49.475 --> 01:52.217
To what do we owe the pleasure,
Alicia?

01:52.347 --> 01:53.000
I think you know.

01:53.131 --> 01:56.656
Eh, it seems
you brought company.

01:56.786 --> 02:00.007
Yet,
Morgan isn't amongst it.

02:00.138 --> 02:02.836
Does he plan on making
a grand entrance or something?

02:02.966 --> 02:04.838
He's somewhere safe
with the baby.

02:04.968 --> 02:06.535
Somewhere
where you won't find him.

02:06.666 --> 02:09.799
Leave it to a coward
to run for the hills.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.019
Auspicious of you
showing up like this.

02:12.150 --> 02:13.629
I was going to call you.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.022
What for?

02:15.153 --> 02:16.850
To talk.

02:18.895 --> 02:20.332
So talk.

02:20.462 --> 02:23.030
Not like this.

02:23.161 --> 02:24.858
Come inside.

02:24.988 --> 02:26.425
Have a drink with me.

02:28.340 --> 02:31.473
Is this you waving
the white flag?

02:33.127 --> 02:34.955
We'll talk about that
on the inside.

02:35.085 --> 02:36.783
One drink.

02:36.913 --> 02:38.176
Just us.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.538
One drink.

02:57.064 --> 02:58.370
What are you doing?

03:02.069 --> 03:03.592
I've got it covered.

03:10.208 --> 03:12.601
Wes, is there something
you want to say?

03:12.732 --> 03:15.952
You drove Alicia away
for a reason.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.694
You let her in here, you could
lose everything you've built.

03:18.825 --> 03:20.218
I won't.

03:20.348 --> 03:22.132
I assure you.

03:24.352 --> 03:26.398
Now, be a gem

03:26.528 --> 03:30.097
and fetch us a bottle
of Luna Fontezula 12

03:30.228 --> 03:32.055
from cold storage, eh?

03:35.537 --> 03:36.712
Oh.

03:36.843 --> 03:39.324
And when the sun
goes down...

03:39.454 --> 03:40.542
be ready.

03:48.289 --> 03:49.856
Get off of me!

03:49.986 --> 03:51.597
You'll have
to excuse them.

03:51.727 --> 03:54.295
We take security
quite seriously around here.

03:56.776 --> 03:59.474
Daniel...
you weren't invited.

03:59.605 --> 04:01.346
He pushed
through the barrier

04:01.476 --> 04:03.304
and almost broke
Stern's neck.

04:03.435 --> 04:05.437
Hmm.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.003
The agreement was for you
and you only.

04:07.134 --> 04:08.614
I didn't ask him
to come.

04:08.744 --> 04:09.702
I want to see Ofelia.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.052
Ofelia?

04:12.182 --> 04:13.488
He's not well.

04:17.318 --> 04:19.233
Take him
to the basement.

04:19.364 --> 04:20.930
Daniel,
it's gonna be okay.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.541
If you hurt him --

04:22.671 --> 04:24.586
No.
That's what the roof is for.

04:24.717 --> 04:27.894
We're just gonna put him
on a little time-out.

04:28.024 --> 04:31.593
Luciana lied to him
and told him Ofelia was in here.

04:31.724 --> 04:32.594
I know.

04:32.725 --> 04:33.987
I've told him.

04:38.992 --> 04:40.907
You can pretend to be outraged
all you want, Alicia,

04:41.037 --> 04:43.431
but at the end
of the day,

04:43.562 --> 04:46.391
you, Morgan, and Luci
are just like Victor.

04:46.521 --> 04:48.175
At least he owns
the shit he does.

04:48.306 --> 04:50.699
You wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for me.

04:50.830 --> 04:52.092
As I recall...

04:52.222 --> 04:53.920
I saved him,
as well.

04:54.050 --> 04:56.401
So which one of you
do I owe my life to?

05:00.100 --> 05:03.016
Well...here we are.

05:03.146 --> 05:04.365
Reunited at last.

05:04.496 --> 05:06.454
She shouldn't be here,
Victor.

05:06.585 --> 05:09.109
She and her friends
left me to die in that bunker.

05:09.239 --> 05:10.589
Wes.

05:15.550 --> 05:18.292
Why don't I give you
the grand tour?

05:18.423 --> 05:19.989
You can see what
you've been missing,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.078
and we can have our drinks in
the comfort of my penthouse --

05:22.209 --> 05:23.689
I'm good right here.

05:31.087 --> 05:32.828
To new beginnings.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.526
Something tells me
we have very different ideas

05:34.656 --> 05:36.484
of what that means.

05:38.356 --> 05:40.445
We'll see about that.

05:45.972 --> 05:47.190
You still have it.

05:51.978 --> 05:54.850
I took it off Will's body
when I buried him.

05:54.981 --> 05:57.505
After you killed him,
of course.

05:57.636 --> 05:59.681
It still means
something to you.

05:59.812 --> 06:01.988
Do you remember
what you said

06:02.118 --> 06:04.730
when you gave it to me
back at Lawton?

06:04.860 --> 06:07.646
You said you needed
to forget who you were.

06:07.776 --> 06:10.823
For you, for me,
for all of us.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.564
Was it worth it?

06:12.694 --> 06:14.914
Absolutely.

06:15.044 --> 06:18.439
Although, I'd argue that
I didn't forget who I was.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.310
I embraced it.

06:23.792 --> 06:26.447
I know what you
must think of me.

06:26.578 --> 06:29.102
But...

06:29.232 --> 06:30.625
our story isn't over,
Alicia.

06:30.756 --> 06:33.062
It is.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.324
And one way or another,

06:34.455 --> 06:36.588
you won't be running this place
after today.

06:36.718 --> 06:38.154
This isn't about today.Then what is it about?

06:38.285 --> 06:40.243
Tomorrow.

06:40.374 --> 06:41.680
Everything that I've done

06:41.810 --> 06:43.246
since that last night
at Lawton

06:43.377 --> 06:46.032
I've done with hopes
that it would lead us here.

06:46.162 --> 06:48.513
To what?

06:48.643 --> 06:50.950
Me and an army of people
who you pissed off,

06:51.080 --> 06:52.647
shit on,
and left to die...

06:54.388 --> 06:56.564
...ready to kick
your ass.

07:05.660 --> 07:07.401
Do it.
Do what?

07:07.532 --> 07:10.709
Youhave your army.
Ihave mine.

07:10.839 --> 07:12.580
And cut the phone
on the platform.

07:12.711 --> 07:13.886
I don't want anyone
warning them.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.844
Warn them about what?

07:15.975 --> 07:18.760
There's a herd of walkers
trapped in a crater

07:18.891 --> 07:20.545
from one of the blasts,

07:20.675 --> 07:23.635
soaking up some nasty stuff
for months.

07:23.765 --> 07:26.986
I just told my rangers
to lead them here.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.164
What is that?

07:31.294 --> 07:33.732
The generator starting.Why?

07:33.862 --> 07:35.951
To power the beacon

07:36.082 --> 07:37.126
to draw the dead

07:37.257 --> 07:39.085
to kill your army.

07:46.092 --> 07:49.530
You think
this is the way to win me over?

07:49.661 --> 07:52.359
You'll come around
eventually.

07:52.490 --> 07:56.015
When I first lit that beacon,
I did it to keep you out.

07:56.145 --> 07:57.669
Now it's
to keep you in.

08:35.358 --> 08:39.058
Fall back!
Get out of here!

08:39.188 --> 08:40.755
They can't hear you.

08:43.845 --> 08:45.717
Turn off the light,
Strand.

08:45.847 --> 08:47.980
I'm sorry
it had to come to this.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.285
You're gonna kill them!

08:49.416 --> 08:51.810
They were never part
of my vision for this place.

08:53.986 --> 08:56.858
Once we build this place
into what it can be,

08:56.989 --> 08:58.468
you'll understand.

08:58.599 --> 09:01.080
Take her downstairs
till this is all over.

09:01.210 --> 09:03.169
And Daniel?

09:03.299 --> 09:04.779
Take him
to the roof.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.567
Are you sure?

09:09.697 --> 09:12.221
An example
must be made.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.832
I'm sorry
I ever doubted you.

09:15.442 --> 09:16.791
Okay.

09:25.931 --> 09:27.193
Drop the gun, Alicia.

09:27.323 --> 09:29.238
Don't.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.067
Turn off the light.

09:32.198 --> 09:33.416
Turn off the light!

09:33.547 --> 09:34.635
You do this,

09:34.766 --> 09:37.203
her entire army
will wipe us out.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.814
Everything I've built
will be gone.

09:39.945 --> 09:41.990
Wes.

09:44.427 --> 09:48.127
You think...
he'll listen to you?

09:48.257 --> 09:50.259
If you won't turn it off,
I will.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.871
We're taking a ride up
to the roof.

09:53.001 --> 09:56.135
I have 50 rangers between here
and that light,

09:56.265 --> 09:58.572
all ready
to do as I say

09:58.703 --> 10:00.400
to protect this place.

10:03.272 --> 10:05.579
Not when I have a gun
to your head.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.892
You're making a mistake,
Alicia --
Shut up.

10:14.022 --> 10:15.763
You're delaying
the inevitable.

10:15.894 --> 10:17.069
You're not calling
the shots anymore.

10:19.637 --> 10:21.508
Come on.

10:21.639 --> 10:23.466
Come on!
They shut it down.

10:23.597 --> 10:24.772
Emergency protocol.

10:24.903 --> 10:28.210
Then override it.Not a chance.

10:28.341 --> 10:29.864
I'll kill you.

10:29.995 --> 10:31.605
You can't stop
what's coming.

10:31.736 --> 10:35.391
You'd rather die
than give this place up?

10:35.522 --> 10:37.306
You won't kill me.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.308
Strand, we're here.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.354
Strand!

10:41.484 --> 10:42.964
I'm doing this
for your own good.

10:43.095 --> 10:44.923
No, you're not.
You're doing this for yourself.

10:45.053 --> 10:46.576
We got the elevator
surrounded.You're doing what Teddy did --

10:46.707 --> 10:49.275
locking me up while you destroy
the things I care about.

10:49.405 --> 10:52.191
And I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told him.

10:52.321 --> 10:55.194
I'm not making the world
the way you want it to be.

11:10.949 --> 11:12.820
I know you feel this way
right now...

11:12.951 --> 11:15.083
but we have a long future
ahead of us.

11:15.214 --> 11:17.651
No.

11:17.782 --> 11:20.175
We don't.Open the door.

11:20.306 --> 11:22.090
What do you mean?

11:22.221 --> 11:24.179
Do I look like
I've got a lot of time left?

11:24.310 --> 11:26.616
Wes told me about the fevers,
but we have antibiotics,

11:26.747 --> 11:29.619
medicine,
a fully-stocked infirmary.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.187
Yeah, it's not gonna work.How do you know?

11:32.318 --> 11:33.972
Because I've tried
everything,

11:34.102 --> 11:37.410
and because
it's getting worse.

11:37.540 --> 11:38.585
Well,
we'll find a way to stop it.

11:38.716 --> 11:40.892
June --
she can figure it out.

11:41.022 --> 11:43.982
No, she won't.

11:44.112 --> 11:46.767
No one survives
what I've been through.

11:49.161 --> 11:51.337
I'm not afraid to die.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.687
Strand.

11:53.818 --> 11:56.385
But it can't end
like this.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.257
Not for them.

11:58.387 --> 11:59.824
Strand!

11:59.954 --> 12:02.174
It can't.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.306
Please.

12:06.831 --> 12:09.485
Turn off the light,

12:09.616 --> 12:11.792
and I'll call off
the army.

12:11.923 --> 12:14.012
You have my word.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.799
That's not
good enough.

12:18.930 --> 12:20.627
Then what will
be enough?

12:20.758 --> 12:22.803
Strand!

12:22.934 --> 12:24.413
Stay...

12:24.544 --> 12:26.285
here...

12:26.415 --> 12:27.808
in the Tower with me.

12:27.939 --> 12:29.984
I told you,
I'm running out of time.

12:30.115 --> 12:32.030
Then give me
what you have left.

12:36.034 --> 12:38.297
I want to show you
that you're wrong about me.

12:38.427 --> 12:39.820
Strand!

12:39.951 --> 12:41.779
Do we have a deal?

13:01.886 --> 13:04.192
Stand down.
Stand down.

13:04.323 --> 13:05.498
It's okay.

13:07.979 --> 13:09.502
Okay.
We'll take her downstairs.

13:09.632 --> 13:11.852
That's not necessary.
We made an agreement.

13:11.983 --> 13:14.420
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:14.550 --> 13:16.030
I agreed to turn
off the light

13:16.161 --> 13:17.945
in exchange
for a cease-fire.

13:19.991 --> 13:21.688
She's playing you.

13:21.819 --> 13:24.212
Can't you see that?Uh, no.

13:24.343 --> 13:25.910
They've got us
surrounded.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.346
The second you turn
that light off, we're done.

13:27.476 --> 13:29.348
No, we're not.How do you know?

13:29.478 --> 13:31.959
Because she also agreed
to live in the Tower with me.

13:35.876 --> 13:38.096
Have you
lost your mind?

13:38.226 --> 13:39.488
After everything
you've done,

13:39.619 --> 13:41.490
you think she's just
gonna accept that?

13:41.621 --> 13:43.492
I do.Based on what?

13:43.623 --> 13:45.451
My instincts.Come on.

13:45.581 --> 13:48.889
Listening to them is what has
made this place what it is.

13:49.020 --> 13:50.891
I'm not gonna stop
listening to them now.

13:51.979 --> 13:53.807
I can't let you do this.

13:55.983 --> 13:58.507
She's your blind spot.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.857
Somebody's got to protect
what you've built.

13:59.987 --> 14:01.902
If you won't do it,
I will.

14:02.033 --> 14:03.034
You're outnumbered,
Wes.

14:07.690 --> 14:10.128
You guys want to go back
to living out there?

14:10.258 --> 14:11.738
You want to give all this up
because of what?

14:11.869 --> 14:15.133
His -- His instincts?

14:15.263 --> 14:17.135
The same ones
that lost us the baby?

14:17.265 --> 14:20.355
Uh-oh.The safety of the moat?

14:20.486 --> 14:23.793
That told him to bring
Alicia in here? No.

14:23.924 --> 14:26.361
No, we can't trust
your instincts, Strand,

14:26.492 --> 14:27.928
not anymore.We?

14:30.757 --> 14:35.022
Oh.
Oh, wow.

14:35.153 --> 14:37.024
You want to turn
that light off...

14:37.155 --> 14:38.460
Huh.
...you got to go
through us.

14:40.723 --> 14:43.465
It's over --
for the both of you.

14:46.294 --> 14:48.296
Hmm.

14:48.427 --> 14:50.690
I should have never
let you in here.

14:50.820 --> 14:52.518
Hey.
Get him.

15:05.226 --> 15:07.750
We need to warn them.They'll be guarding
the doors like hawks.

15:07.881 --> 15:10.275
The tunnel, too.

15:10.405 --> 15:13.017
We're not gonna be able to
make it to the roof on our own.

15:13.147 --> 15:15.715
We may have one ally left.
Come on.

15:23.244 --> 15:25.116
Yeah?Kill the old man.

15:25.246 --> 15:26.639
What?

15:26.769 --> 15:29.120
Strand said that -- Strand's not in charge anymore.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.122
Hey, what the hell's
going on up there?

15:31.252 --> 15:33.211
I've got it handled.

15:33.341 --> 15:34.952
We can't take any chances,
a'ight?

15:35.082 --> 15:36.127
Take him out.

15:39.260 --> 15:41.784
You know why this
is happening to you?

15:41.915 --> 15:46.050
It's never too late
to learn new things.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.877
When you handcuff
a person,

15:48.008 --> 15:49.792
you put their hands
in the back,

15:49.923 --> 15:51.751
not the front.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.476
Daniel, stop, stop.
He's here to help.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.609
Now, I know how it sounds.

16:23.739 --> 16:25.654
Yeah,
like he's lying to us.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.526
The beacon light
is drawing a herd here.

16:27.656 --> 16:29.484
If we don't turn it off,
everyone out there is gonna die.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.834
So, call off your dogs.They're no longer my dogs.

16:31.965 --> 16:34.924
We need your help
to get past them to the roof.

16:35.055 --> 16:37.623
I'm not helping anyone
until I see Ofelia.

16:37.753 --> 16:39.625
She's here.

16:39.755 --> 16:41.018
Where is she?

16:44.282 --> 16:48.547
Daniel, you remember
what happened in Mexico?

16:48.677 --> 16:50.288
Strand helped you
search for her.

16:50.418 --> 16:54.422
He was gonna reunite you,
but...

16:54.553 --> 16:55.858
she got sick.

16:55.989 --> 16:57.208
You didn't get there
in time.

17:03.997 --> 17:08.741
Hey.
Ofelia was sick, yes.

17:08.871 --> 17:10.830
But Strand never
reunited us.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.224
We never found her...

17:13.354 --> 17:16.140
because he kept lying.

17:16.270 --> 17:21.101
Ofelia's alive,
and she is in this Tower.

17:21.232 --> 17:24.191
And you know where she is,
Victor.

17:26.715 --> 17:30.023
Where is she?

17:30.154 --> 17:32.634
Do you want to end up
like your friend here?

17:34.506 --> 17:36.812
She's on the top floor.

17:36.943 --> 17:39.293
Ah, the penthouse.

17:39.424 --> 17:40.468
Smart choice.

17:40.599 --> 17:42.340
Strand.

17:44.472 --> 17:46.605
Are you lying to me?

17:46.735 --> 17:48.302
She's there.

17:48.433 --> 17:52.132
We just need you to help us
to get to her.

17:59.618 --> 18:00.706
Okay.

18:25.731 --> 18:28.081
They surely heard
that upstairs.

18:28.212 --> 18:29.952
I'm going
to the next level.

18:30.083 --> 18:31.171
We'll hang back,

18:31.302 --> 18:33.260
make sure no one
enters from below.

18:40.441 --> 18:43.357
What's the play here,
Strand?

18:43.488 --> 18:46.099
June, Grace, Wendell.

18:46.230 --> 18:48.101
After what happened
with that baby,

18:48.232 --> 18:51.235
I locked them
on the top floor.

18:51.365 --> 18:52.323
What do you
think is gonna happen

18:52.453 --> 18:54.412
when he realizes
Ofelia's not up there?

18:54.542 --> 18:57.893
By that time,
it won't even matter.

18:58.024 --> 19:02.028
We'll free them,
get them on our side.

19:02.159 --> 19:04.465
He'll have to relent.

19:04.596 --> 19:06.424
You're lying to him.

19:06.554 --> 19:08.252
I'm finishing what
Luciana started.

19:08.382 --> 19:09.862
It will destroy him.

19:09.992 --> 19:12.430
I didn't put that thought
into his head.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.215
But if that's what's keeping
this place standing.

19:19.437 --> 19:23.136
Alicia, I know you must think
I'm a monster,

19:23.267 --> 19:25.269
but I'm the same man
I've always been.

19:25.399 --> 19:27.227
I've just stopped
apologizing for it.

19:29.403 --> 19:31.884
Do you actually
believe that?

19:32.014 --> 19:35.279
I do.
And so will you.

19:35.409 --> 19:38.325
That's the reason why
I'm willing to turn
off that light --

19:38.456 --> 19:40.414
because I want you to see
that everything that I've done

19:40.545 --> 19:41.589
was worth it.

19:47.726 --> 19:49.728
Come on!

19:49.858 --> 19:51.469
Okay.

19:58.954 --> 20:01.305
Victor, I...

20:01.435 --> 20:04.264
I ca...

20:04.395 --> 20:06.397
Oh!
Hey! Victor!

20:06.527 --> 20:07.746
We need to get her
to the infirmary.

20:07.876 --> 20:09.661
We have a deal.And I will honor that,

20:09.791 --> 20:11.184
but first,
we need to help her!

20:11.315 --> 20:14.405
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on.

20:18.322 --> 20:19.540
They found us.

20:23.109 --> 20:24.110
We don't
have time for this.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.118
We need to move, Strand.

20:32.249 --> 20:34.468
Ah!
Epinephrine.

20:34.599 --> 20:36.296
June had this on hand
when I was poisoned.

20:36.427 --> 20:37.471
This could help.

20:38.994 --> 20:40.953
More will be coming.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.868
We need to get
out of here fast.

20:42.998 --> 20:45.436
Okay. Alright.

20:57.230 --> 20:58.187
What is this?

20:59.798 --> 21:01.713
It's a record of everyone
in the Tower.

21:09.111 --> 21:11.462
Her name
is not on here.

21:11.592 --> 21:12.463
Why?

21:16.684 --> 21:19.992
Daniel...
she's not on the top floor.

21:20.122 --> 21:22.211
I only told you that
because I knew

21:22.342 --> 21:24.475
it was the only way
that you would help me.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.129
And now I can help you.

21:27.260 --> 21:29.697
Do you want
your daughter?

21:29.828 --> 21:30.916
Well, there she is.

21:31.046 --> 21:32.874
Show me.

22:04.253 --> 22:06.517
That's not my daughter.

22:06.647 --> 22:09.433
Where is she?

22:09.563 --> 22:12.610
Ofelia died in Mexico,
Daniel.

22:12.740 --> 22:15.482
Luciana lied to you
the same reason I did.

22:15.613 --> 22:16.831
So you had something
to fight for.

22:16.962 --> 22:18.616
Daniel...

22:20.748 --> 22:22.837
You're always trying
to fool people.

22:22.968 --> 22:24.752
I'm trying to save the closest
thing that I have to a daughter.

22:24.883 --> 22:26.928
Surely you can understand that,
Daniel.

22:27.059 --> 22:29.409
Ofelia's gone.

22:29.540 --> 22:32.456
But it's not as if
you have nothing left.

22:33.935 --> 22:36.111
Charlie.

22:36.242 --> 22:39.114
She means
something to you.

22:39.245 --> 22:41.073
She's sick.

22:41.203 --> 22:43.510
She doesn't have
much time left.

22:45.686 --> 22:47.427
She's not
my daughter!

22:54.260 --> 22:56.088
I'm finished with you.

22:56.218 --> 22:58.743
No.
No, Daniel.

22:58.873 --> 23:00.440
No.

23:03.051 --> 23:05.924
Maybe you can do for her
what you couldn't for Ofelia.

23:06.054 --> 23:08.709
You could be there
for her.

23:11.538 --> 23:12.974
Daniel?

23:16.108 --> 23:19.633
Don't look, Charlie.
I don't want you to look at me.

23:19.764 --> 23:22.680
I don't want this to be
what you remember...

23:22.810 --> 23:24.682
of me.

23:24.812 --> 23:27.598
Don't do it, Daniel.

23:27.728 --> 23:29.295
He's right.

23:29.426 --> 23:31.253
Daniel...

23:33.604 --> 23:35.693
...be the man you wanted
Ofelia to see.

24:13.426 --> 24:15.733
Easy, now.
That's the adrenaline.

24:18.649 --> 24:20.520
Oh.

24:20.651 --> 24:22.174
How you feelin'?

24:23.349 --> 24:25.482
Oh.

24:25.612 --> 24:28.441
Thank you.

24:28.572 --> 24:29.747
Mm.

24:29.877 --> 24:31.488
I should be thanking
you.

24:31.618 --> 24:33.838
He would have killed me

24:33.968 --> 24:36.362
if you hadn't appealed
to his better angels.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.105
What happened to her?

24:40.235 --> 24:42.194
Radiation exposure.

24:42.324 --> 24:43.543
But that doesn't
mean that --

24:43.674 --> 24:45.545
It's worse than what
you were exposed to.

24:45.676 --> 24:47.895
We think it was
Alpha particles

24:48.026 --> 24:50.811
from the same walkers
that are headed here.

24:50.942 --> 24:52.639
June and Grace...

24:52.770 --> 24:54.467
say she may only have
a couple weeks left.

24:58.906 --> 25:00.560
There's nothing
that can be done?

25:00.691 --> 25:02.823
I'm afraid not.

25:02.954 --> 25:06.000
All the more reason
to preserve this place,

25:06.131 --> 25:08.089
so at least those weeks
can be spent in here,

25:08.220 --> 25:09.264
not out there.

25:13.181 --> 25:14.139
Come on.

25:19.927 --> 25:23.409
Daniel...
we have to go.

25:23.540 --> 25:24.976
I can't leave her --

25:25.106 --> 25:27.152
not now,
not like this.

25:27.282 --> 25:28.675
She needs me.

25:31.722 --> 25:33.158
Can you still go up
to the roof?

25:33.288 --> 25:35.421
Daniel, it's okay.

25:35.552 --> 25:37.336
You can go.
No.

25:37.466 --> 25:39.033
No, no, no.

25:39.164 --> 25:42.123
This is where I want to be --
here, with you.

25:49.696 --> 25:51.655
I'm so sorry
I'm not her.

25:51.785 --> 25:53.526
Oh, don't be.

25:53.657 --> 25:55.136
Don't be.

25:57.138 --> 26:01.055
You helped me remember
why I wanted to find her...

26:01.186 --> 26:04.276
before she died --
Ofelia.

26:04.406 --> 26:08.759
Um, and, you know,
being with you,

26:08.889 --> 26:10.761
it's helping me
to think more clearly.

26:17.289 --> 26:19.639
We stashed weapons on every
floor after Arno's attack,

26:19.770 --> 26:22.599
so we'd be prepared in case
anybody was planning an encore.

26:28.300 --> 26:29.475
Did you mean it?

26:29.606 --> 26:31.259
Mean what?

26:31.390 --> 26:34.132
What you said
to Daniel.

26:34.262 --> 26:37.701
About me being the closest thing
you had to a daughter.

26:37.831 --> 26:40.312
He and I wanted
the same thing.

26:40.442 --> 26:42.575
I needed him
to know that.

26:48.625 --> 26:50.801
You did make him see it.

26:50.931 --> 26:52.977
It wasn't just me
that talked him down.

26:55.675 --> 26:57.677
We used to do this sort of thing
all the time --

26:57.808 --> 26:59.113
saving people.

27:01.507 --> 27:04.075
What, you mean Wes?

27:04.205 --> 27:08.253
It's been a while,
but despite everything,

27:08.383 --> 27:11.691
I still think we make
a pretty good team.

27:17.479 --> 27:18.698
I guess we'll find out.

27:22.310 --> 27:24.399
There are way more of them
than us.

27:24.530 --> 27:26.575
They're gonna
see us coming.

27:29.404 --> 27:31.493
Not necessarily.

27:53.037 --> 27:54.429
We're flying blind here,
Strand.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.562
Not as blind as they are.
I'll clear the stairwell.

27:56.693 --> 27:58.346
You stay here
and deflect any stragglers.

27:58.477 --> 28:00.174
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

28:00.305 --> 28:02.960
This isn't my first time
walking into the unknown.

28:23.371 --> 28:24.721
Strand?

28:24.851 --> 28:26.766
Strand!

28:26.897 --> 28:29.943
Clear!
Head to the sixth floor!

28:35.557 --> 28:37.081
Tear gas, Victor?

28:42.260 --> 28:46.220
Now, those...

28:46.351 --> 28:48.266
remind me
of the day we first met.

28:51.138 --> 28:55.534
Yeah, but so much has changed
since then, Victor.

28:55.664 --> 28:57.014
You...

28:59.277 --> 29:01.105
...me...

29:03.498 --> 29:04.543
...her.

29:04.673 --> 29:06.240
Hmm.

29:06.371 --> 29:10.201
I know you want to believe
the best in her, Victor.

29:10.331 --> 29:11.724
I did, too.

29:11.855 --> 29:14.596
But we are who we are.

29:14.727 --> 29:17.382
You've come so far.

29:17.512 --> 29:20.254
Finish what you started,
Victor.

29:20.385 --> 29:24.519
You have to protect
what you've built here.

29:24.650 --> 29:27.696
It's honest.
It's real.

29:27.827 --> 29:31.700
It -- It doesn't try to be
something that's not possible.

29:31.831 --> 29:34.747
Do not throw it
all away for her.

29:41.188 --> 29:42.102
I'm not.

29:46.977 --> 29:48.935
Alicia!

29:50.981 --> 29:52.634
Alicia!

29:52.765 --> 29:56.334
Strand.

29:56.464 --> 29:57.422
Strand...

29:57.552 --> 29:59.467
Hey, you alright?

29:59.598 --> 30:01.208
The adrenaline -- I --

30:01.339 --> 30:03.080
I think it's starting
to wear off.

30:03.210 --> 30:04.690
Okay, alright.
I got you. I got you.

30:04.821 --> 30:06.213
Come here.
Come on.

30:06.344 --> 30:08.085
I didn't think
you'd come back for me.

30:08.215 --> 30:09.869
Of course I would.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.089
Last time I was in a fog
like this, I was with Will.

30:12.219 --> 30:13.786
He could've left me
out there.

30:13.917 --> 30:15.309
I gave him plenty of reasons to,
but he didn't.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.269
Why?
'Cause he knew I was
trying to find you.

30:19.836 --> 30:21.315
I can't let you do this!Go, go, go!

30:30.629 --> 30:32.413
Go.

30:41.509 --> 30:43.947
How much ammo do you have?Not enough.

30:45.209 --> 30:46.514
Aah!

30:53.434 --> 30:55.132
Hey, Vic,
you coming out?

30:55.262 --> 30:56.481
Or you gonna make us
come in there?

30:56.611 --> 30:58.396
I'm sorry, Alicia.

31:01.616 --> 31:04.184
Aaaah.

31:04.315 --> 31:07.927
I wanted us
to have a clean slate.

31:08.058 --> 31:10.974
I wanted us
to rebuild together.

31:11.104 --> 31:13.715
I thought
we had more time.

31:13.846 --> 31:16.588
You know, to heal,
to mend.

31:19.199 --> 31:21.158
Last chance, Strand.

31:23.073 --> 31:24.422
Will made me realize
something that

31:24.552 --> 31:26.598
I should have told you
a long time ago.

31:29.296 --> 31:31.124
That I love you,
Alicia.

31:32.909 --> 31:36.086
You're the closest thing
to family that I have left.

31:36.216 --> 31:39.176
That's what this was about.
That's what it was always about.

31:42.005 --> 31:46.400
I just wanted to...
prove something to you.

31:46.531 --> 31:48.011
I hoped that this place
would show you the --

31:48.141 --> 31:50.317
the man that I am.

31:52.406 --> 31:55.061
Everything I've done,
everything that it's cost me...

31:57.107 --> 31:59.196
...that it was
worth it...

31:59.326 --> 32:03.809
because if it didn't...

32:03.940 --> 32:05.158
then it was for nothing.

32:10.903 --> 32:12.383
Hands up.

32:18.128 --> 32:20.391
Please don't do this,
Wes.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.046
Those people out there
don't deserve to die.

32:23.176 --> 32:24.917
Neither do the ones
in here.

32:25.048 --> 32:27.006
You might want to,
but you can't save everyone.

32:27.137 --> 32:28.616
She says she would
call off her army.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.357
All we have to do
is turn off that light.

32:30.488 --> 32:32.316
You honestly still
believe that?Yes, I do.

32:32.446 --> 32:35.623
You know, I was thinking
about the day we met.

32:35.754 --> 32:40.454
And I told you
that people are people.

32:40.585 --> 32:43.675
I thought you were
the exception to that rule.

32:43.805 --> 32:45.938
But now I know no one is.

32:46.069 --> 32:47.722
And I thought
you understood that,

32:47.853 --> 32:49.420
which is why you kept her
far away from here.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.118
It was a mistake.It wasn't.

32:52.249 --> 32:55.730
This place won't be weaker
if we help people out there.

32:55.861 --> 32:56.514
It will be stronger.

32:56.644 --> 32:58.255
No, it won't.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.825
I found this in her bag.

33:06.089 --> 33:08.308
What is that?A transmitter.

33:08.439 --> 33:11.137
Now, out of all
the things

33:11.268 --> 33:13.313
you could have brought in
with you, why that?

33:20.538 --> 33:21.930
I brought it
from the bunker.

33:22.061 --> 33:24.585
I wanted to broadcast a message
from the roof.

33:24.716 --> 33:26.370
What message?

33:26.500 --> 33:28.894
There are people out there
that need help.

33:30.417 --> 33:33.377
And they thought
they could find that with Padre.

33:35.857 --> 33:37.511
There is no Padre.

33:39.644 --> 33:41.733
At least,
not out there.

33:41.863 --> 33:44.431
So, I thought I could use
the transmitter...

33:44.562 --> 33:46.346
So you could
build Padre here.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.222
I told you
I'm not afraid to die.

33:56.443 --> 33:58.489
But this place...

33:58.619 --> 34:01.187
will live long
after I'm gone.

34:03.929 --> 34:05.974
She's lying to you,

34:06.105 --> 34:07.976
just like Luciana
lied to Daniel.No!

34:08.107 --> 34:09.717
That is why she wants
to go to the roof,

34:09.848 --> 34:11.154
not because of the light.

34:11.284 --> 34:12.242
She's just telling you
what she needs to,

34:12.372 --> 34:13.895
so she can get
what she wants.

34:14.026 --> 34:15.767
And what is that, Wes?!She sends that message,

34:15.897 --> 34:19.162
she draws more people here,
and we don't stand a chance.

34:19.292 --> 34:21.120
I told you,

34:21.251 --> 34:23.557
if you don't protect this place,
I will.

34:23.688 --> 34:24.471
No!

34:27.039 --> 34:28.258
I'm sorry, Alicia.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.350
It's fine.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.526
It's fine.

34:52.630 --> 34:53.718
Drop it.

34:56.286 --> 34:57.591
Daniel, are you okay?

34:57.722 --> 34:59.941
I'm fine.

35:00.072 --> 35:01.813
You need
to warn the others.

35:01.943 --> 35:03.597
June, Grace, and Wendell --
they're locked

35:03.728 --> 35:04.859
in an apartment
on the sixth floor.

35:04.990 --> 35:06.687
Free them.

35:06.818 --> 35:11.039
Then go down and tell everyone
to get away from the herd.

35:11.170 --> 35:13.868
Do it...
and I'll kill her.

35:13.999 --> 35:16.219
Wes...please.

35:16.349 --> 35:17.524
I can't let you do it,
Alicia.

35:20.527 --> 35:24.140
I saved your life once.
We both did.

35:24.270 --> 35:26.098
You believed in us
once before.

35:26.229 --> 35:28.535
And I'm just asking you
to do the same thing...

35:49.600 --> 35:51.341
Why would you do that?

35:51.471 --> 35:53.952
The same reason I built
the Tower the way I did.

35:59.784 --> 36:01.220
So you wouldn't
have to.

36:04.615 --> 36:06.791
He wasn't gonna
stand down.

36:08.401 --> 36:11.665
And we're running
out of time.

36:11.796 --> 36:13.189
Let's go turn
that light off.

36:13.319 --> 36:15.452
Alright, come on.

36:40.738 --> 36:42.435
She should've been out
by now.

36:42.566 --> 36:44.394
We can't wait
much longer.

36:44.524 --> 36:45.960
Luci's got a point.

36:46.091 --> 36:47.571
As long as that thing's
a-spinnin',

36:47.701 --> 36:50.356
skinbags'll be on us
like flies on a turd.

36:55.056 --> 36:56.275
Wait.
Someone's coming.

37:08.635 --> 37:10.463
Wen...

37:17.905 --> 37:18.906
You alright?

37:19.037 --> 37:23.389
I'm better now, sis.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.783
What the hell
is goin' on in there?How did you get past
the Rangers?

37:25.913 --> 37:27.741
Listen,
I don't have time to explain,

37:27.872 --> 37:32.877
but we all need to get
back inside of the Tower now.

37:33.007 --> 37:35.358
W-Where's Morgan?He did what you said.

37:35.488 --> 37:36.881
He took her somewhere safe.Where?

37:37.011 --> 37:39.231
We don't know yet.We need to hurry.

37:39.362 --> 37:41.364
The dead
in the crater --

37:41.494 --> 37:44.192
the beacon light
is drawing them here.

37:44.323 --> 37:45.106
¿Estás seguroDaniel?

37:45.237 --> 37:46.717
Sí.

37:46.847 --> 37:48.066
No soy un mentiroso.

37:48.196 --> 37:50.111
Well,
how far are they?

37:50.242 --> 37:51.548
I'm not sure.

37:51.678 --> 37:53.158
But Alicia and Strand
are turning

37:53.289 --> 37:55.203
the light off as we speak.

37:55.334 --> 37:57.118
Vic and AC are
on the same team?

37:57.249 --> 37:58.598
What the hell
did we miss?

37:58.729 --> 38:01.427
We can talk inside of the Tower.
Let's go.

38:03.037 --> 38:05.344
Come on. Let's go.

38:05.475 --> 38:06.911
You need to let me patch
that up, okay?

38:07.041 --> 38:08.608
See Charlie first.

38:08.739 --> 38:10.306
Charlie?

38:13.265 --> 38:18.792
Strand trató de convencerme
de queCharlie esOphelia.

38:18.923 --> 38:20.141
Siguiendo lo que
tu empezaste.

38:20.272 --> 38:22.056
Lo siento mucho, Daniel.

38:22.187 --> 38:23.841
¿Por qué lo hiciste?

38:23.971 --> 38:25.843
Pensé que era
la única manera.

38:28.933 --> 38:29.629
Move!

38:37.071 --> 38:37.985
They're on the roof!

38:41.424 --> 38:42.947
They're trying
to box us out!

39:11.889 --> 39:13.630
Why are they
still shooting?

39:13.760 --> 39:16.067
The Rangers guarding the tunnel
must have circled around.

39:16.197 --> 39:17.764
They're sitting ducks.

39:23.988 --> 39:25.424
The walkers are almost here.
Turn it off.

39:25.555 --> 39:26.860
I'll give them as much cover
as I can.

39:37.567 --> 39:39.656
Strand!

39:39.786 --> 39:41.788
What are you doing?

39:41.919 --> 39:43.703
What are you waiting for?
Turn it off.

39:43.834 --> 39:45.009
You're never gonna forgive me,
are you?

39:45.139 --> 39:46.706
What?

39:46.837 --> 39:49.100
What are you
talking about?

39:49.230 --> 39:50.884
Even if I turn it off,

39:51.015 --> 39:54.105
even if I help you
save everyone,

39:54.235 --> 39:55.802
the damage is
already done.

39:59.415 --> 40:02.679
We don't have time
for this.

40:09.642 --> 40:11.339
It was never
gonna be enough.

40:11.470 --> 40:12.384
It was never gonna
make you love me!

40:12.515 --> 40:14.168
It could've,
but you ruined it!

40:14.299 --> 40:15.909
How?
By what you did to Wes!

40:16.040 --> 40:17.128
I didn't have a choice!

40:17.258 --> 40:18.956
Of course you did!
You always do!

40:19.086 --> 40:20.523
And you always make
the wrong one!

40:20.653 --> 40:22.176
I was trying
to save your life!

40:22.307 --> 40:23.874
No, you were trying
to save yours!

40:24.004 --> 40:26.877
And you didn't care
who you had to kill to do it!

40:27.007 --> 40:28.182
That's not true!

40:31.577 --> 40:33.753
Alicia! Don't!

40:33.884 --> 40:35.146
The person
you used to be --

40:35.276 --> 40:37.191
the person you said
you wanted to forget --

40:37.322 --> 40:38.889
that was never you!

40:58.256 --> 41:00.301
They're here.

41:40.472 --> 41:41.691
What are you doing?

41:50.264 --> 41:52.223
It's too late.

41:52.353 --> 41:53.920
There's no way
out of here.

41:57.620 --> 41:58.882
There's one.

42:05.279 --> 42:06.933
This is Alicia Clark.

42:08.761 --> 42:11.155
If you're listening to this,

42:11.285 --> 42:14.637
you're not alone.

42:14.767 --> 42:17.291
The place you've been
looking for,

42:17.422 --> 42:18.728
the place you've heard about,

42:18.858 --> 42:22.819
PADRE, it's here --
the Tower.

42:22.949 --> 42:28.912
Coordinates 29 degrees,
20 minutes, 14.1 seconds north,

42:29.042 --> 42:33.438
94 degrees, 59 minutes,
25.7 seconds west.

42:35.832 --> 42:38.182
We're gonna build the new home
you've been looking for.

42:38.312 --> 42:41.185
We can help you.

42:41.315 --> 42:43.187
But, first...

42:43.317 --> 42:46.451
we're gonna need
a little help from you.

42:53.980 --> 42:55.634
Alicia!

43:02.249 --> 43:03.816
It's gonna spread
through the whole building.

43:03.947 --> 43:06.645
No.

43:06.776 --> 43:08.255
Alicia!

43:08.386 --> 43:09.430
Alicia!

43:37.197 --> 43:39.112
I'm here.

43:42.681 --> 43:45.553
Can your friend
really help us find Padre?

43:47.077 --> 43:48.382
We don't even know
if that place is real.

43:51.472 --> 43:53.649
We might actually have
someplace to go.

44:08.054 --> 44:09.882
Alicia's here
for you.

44:10.013 --> 44:11.318
Divine providence.

44:12.929 --> 44:14.800
Strand --
he realizes that Alicia

44:14.931 --> 44:17.281
has showed up with the army
at his front doorstep,

44:17.411 --> 44:19.979
and it feels like all the cards
are aligning for him.

44:20.110 --> 44:21.328
She's right there.

44:21.459 --> 44:23.853
This is exactly
according to the plan.

44:23.983 --> 44:28.379
But, as the episode goes on,
we see what Strand viewed as

44:28.509 --> 44:31.425
divine providence might
actually be quite the opposite.

44:31.556 --> 44:33.819
To new beginnings.Something tells me

44:33.950 --> 44:35.429
we have very different ideas
of what that means.

44:35.560 --> 44:36.866
He really
wants to give her the tour

44:36.996 --> 44:38.128
and show her around.

44:38.258 --> 44:39.956
Alicia has no interest in that.

44:40.086 --> 44:41.871
She actually looks
pretty disgusted with him.

44:42.001 --> 44:44.134
She just wants to
get this over with.

44:44.264 --> 44:46.397
She shouldn't
be here, Victor.

44:46.527 --> 44:48.747
She and her friends left me
to die in that bunker.

44:48.878 --> 44:50.357
Wes is very much against

44:50.488 --> 44:52.316
Strand allowing Alicia
into the tower.

44:52.446 --> 44:54.840
He thinks it's a huge mistake.

44:54.971 --> 44:56.363
Strand sees the
Saint Christopher medallion

44:56.494 --> 44:58.104
around Alicia's neck.

44:58.235 --> 45:01.629
He realizes that she must still
have some feeling for him.

45:01.760 --> 45:04.807
That's a shred of hope
for him that

45:04.937 --> 45:08.027
"Maybe there's still
a chance for us to reconcile."

45:08.158 --> 45:10.073
I took it off Will's body
when I buried him.

45:10.900 --> 45:12.553
After you killed him,
of course.

45:12.684 --> 45:16.253
Will, who Strand
killed specifically to hurt her.

45:18.255 --> 45:19.778
Strand is operating

45:19.909 --> 45:21.214
from a pretty desperate place.

45:21.345 --> 45:22.650
Do it.

45:22.781 --> 45:23.739
Do what?You have your army.

45:23.869 --> 45:25.610
I have mine.

45:25.741 --> 45:28.395
And, so, in sort of
his twisted view at this point,

45:28.526 --> 45:30.093
if he can get her
inside the tower

45:30.223 --> 45:32.443
in a way where she can't escape,
he's literally going to

45:32.573 --> 45:36.621
bring these walkers
to surround the tower

45:36.752 --> 45:38.188
to take out all of her friends.

45:38.318 --> 45:39.842
You're gonna kill them.

45:39.972 --> 45:42.061
They were never part of
my vision for this place.

45:42.192 --> 45:43.715
He knows that that
will make her hate him,

45:43.846 --> 45:47.110
initially, but in time,
she will grow to understand him.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.373
Take her downstairs
till this is all over.

45:49.503 --> 45:51.941
And it's a very
misguided way to look at things,

45:52.071 --> 45:54.857
but it just shows
how desperate he is.

46:07.391 --> 46:09.480
I know you feel
this way right now,

46:09.610 --> 46:10.829
but we have a
long future ahead of us.

46:10.960 --> 46:12.309
No.

46:12.439 --> 46:14.833
When Strand hears that
Alicia is getting worse

46:14.964 --> 46:16.487
and there doesn't seem
to be a cure

46:16.617 --> 46:18.054
for what's making her be sick,

46:18.184 --> 46:20.970
that's an earthquake for him,
because the thing

46:21.100 --> 46:25.061
that he thought he had was
the luxury of time with Alicia.

46:25.191 --> 46:26.889
But it can't end
like this.

46:27.019 --> 46:29.282
He thought, "There
will be time to mend the rift

46:29.413 --> 46:32.242
and we'll be together
and she'll understand me

46:32.372 --> 46:33.460
and she'll come to forgive me."

46:33.591 --> 46:35.114
Please.

46:35.245 --> 46:36.333
When he realizes
there is no time,

46:36.463 --> 46:39.336
that whole plan sort of
goes out the window.

46:39.466 --> 46:41.860
Everything that he'd been
planning, his divine providence,

46:41.991 --> 46:45.690
her showing up at the door,
and him sort of forcing her

46:45.821 --> 46:49.476
to be in this tower with him,
suddenly, it all falls apart,

46:49.607 --> 46:51.087
and he realizes
that's not gonna work

46:51.217 --> 46:55.874
and it radically changes
how he looks at Alicia

46:56.005 --> 46:57.833
and what he has to do now
in order to

46:57.963 --> 46:59.660
mend the relationship with her.

46:59.791 --> 47:01.619
I should have never
let you in here.

47:01.749 --> 47:03.055
Hey. Get him.

47:08.713 --> 47:12.195
We've done
a story set in a tower before,

47:12.325 --> 47:16.112
in Season 6, with Dwight and Al
forcing their way to the roof.

47:16.242 --> 47:18.157
And the thing, I think,
that interested us

47:18.288 --> 47:22.031
the most was seeing
Strand now suddenly being

47:22.161 --> 47:24.990
the odd man out
in his own house...

47:25.121 --> 47:27.340
Do not throw it
all away for her.

47:27.471 --> 47:28.776
...and he has to
get to the roof

47:28.907 --> 47:30.126
to save all of
Alicia's friends...

47:30.256 --> 47:31.736
I'm not.

47:31.867 --> 47:33.129
...and that the people
who are preventing him

47:33.259 --> 47:34.826
from doing that
are the very ones

47:34.957 --> 47:37.307
that he brought in the tower
in the first place.

47:37.437 --> 47:38.830
Take him out.

47:39.962 --> 47:42.529
Daniel believes
that Ofelia is alive

47:42.660 --> 47:45.532
and in this tower, so when he
realizes that's not the case...

47:45.663 --> 47:46.969
Her name is not on here.

47:47.099 --> 47:48.187
...initially, Strand,

47:48.318 --> 47:50.015
in order to to save
his own life,

47:50.146 --> 47:53.497
he knows that Charlie is someone
Daniel's very close to.

47:53.627 --> 47:57.283
So he tries to play it off like,
"There's Ofelia."

47:57.414 --> 47:59.198
And, of course,
Daniel doesn't fall for that.

47:59.329 --> 48:00.591
She's not my daughter!

48:03.507 --> 48:05.552
But, ultimately,
it proves to be the thing

48:05.683 --> 48:09.426
that snaps Daniel
out of his fog.

48:09.556 --> 48:11.080
He realizes that
if he kills Strand,

48:11.210 --> 48:12.995
that's the exact opposite
of what he would have

48:13.125 --> 48:15.388
wanted to do
if he'd found Ofelia.

48:15.519 --> 48:18.217
And he sort of sees
this opportunity where

48:18.348 --> 48:21.177
he can do with Charlie what
he hoped to do with Ofelia --

48:21.307 --> 48:23.962
sort of let her in
and see who he really is

48:24.093 --> 48:25.181
and to help her in a way that

48:25.311 --> 48:27.923
he couldn't help
his own daughter.

48:29.272 --> 48:31.796
Alicia! Alicia!

48:31.927 --> 48:36.061
The scene where Strand
wades into the tear-gas fog

48:36.192 --> 48:38.803
is very much designed to be
a parallel to

48:38.934 --> 48:42.328
Strand in the fog in the
premiere episode of this season.

48:42.459 --> 48:45.462
Both times he waded into the
fog, it was all about Alicia.

48:45.592 --> 48:49.031
In 701, it was about wanting to
make sure that she was alive

48:49.161 --> 48:50.815
and that she was okay.

48:50.946 --> 48:53.470
And in this case, it's about
wanting to clear the walkers,

48:53.600 --> 48:56.081
clear the path -- not only
so that Alicia will be okay,

48:56.212 --> 48:59.258
but so that he can do right
by her and redeem himself

48:59.389 --> 49:01.478
by getting to that roof
and turning off that beacon

49:01.608 --> 49:02.827
to save everyone else.

49:06.918 --> 49:08.615
You believed in us
once before,

49:08.746 --> 49:11.618
and I'm just asking you
to do the same thing.

49:11.749 --> 49:13.707
I think what's
so tragic about that moment

49:13.838 --> 49:17.842
is that Alicia did feel like
she was getting through to Wes

49:17.973 --> 49:19.496
and that she was
starting to appeal

49:19.626 --> 49:21.454
to his Better Angels again.

49:21.585 --> 49:23.108
And if she just had
a little more time,

49:23.239 --> 49:24.283
maybe she would have
been able to do that.

49:24.414 --> 49:26.720
Strand saw it
completely differently.

49:26.851 --> 49:28.635
Strand looked at Wes
and saw someone who was

49:28.766 --> 49:31.421
never going to stand down and
that they were going to have to

49:31.551 --> 49:32.988
kill to get to the roof.

49:34.380 --> 49:36.078
Let's go turn
that light off.

49:36.208 --> 49:38.167
He felt he was
doing something good for her.

49:38.297 --> 49:41.300
For Alicia, that was proof
that Strand hasn't changed,

49:41.431 --> 49:43.737
and it's exactly the reason
she doesn't trust him.

49:43.868 --> 49:46.697
So it's this
terrible tragic moment of

49:46.827 --> 49:50.092
conflicting motivations
and understandings of each other

49:50.222 --> 49:51.223
that ultimately leads to
the confrontation

49:51.354 --> 49:52.833
we see up on the roof.

49:52.964 --> 49:54.096
What are you doing?

49:54.226 --> 49:55.575
Strand, what are
you waiting for?

49:55.706 --> 49:57.055
Turn it off.

49:57.186 --> 49:58.535
You're never gonna
forgive me, are you?

49:58.665 --> 50:00.319
He ultimately
realizes, "If I can't get her

50:00.450 --> 50:02.104
to love me,
then I'm not even gonna try,"

50:02.234 --> 50:03.888
and he's going to double down on
his worst instinct,

50:04.019 --> 50:06.325
which had at the beginning
of the episode,

50:06.456 --> 50:09.285
was to keep drawing
those radioactive walkers here.

50:13.028 --> 50:16.901
The beacon breaking is
a metaphor for Strand himself.

50:18.076 --> 50:20.339
He is broken by
everything that's happened,

50:20.470 --> 50:22.515
by Alicia's
lack of faith in him.

50:22.646 --> 50:24.517
They are at
their worst point yet,

50:24.648 --> 50:26.476
and they've already
been at pretty low points.

50:26.606 --> 50:28.695
The radioactive walkers
have arrived,

50:28.826 --> 50:29.827
putting everyone else in peril.

50:29.957 --> 50:32.134
The tower is on fire.

50:32.264 --> 50:34.353
I think Strand feels
this is the end for him.

50:34.484 --> 50:37.356
There's nothing left he can do,
and he will die

50:37.487 --> 50:39.663
having done the
worst possible thing he could

50:39.793 --> 50:42.361
and just become
the worst version of himself.

50:42.492 --> 50:45.625
He's as broken as that beacon.Alicia!
