no confidence in Abby

03:50.397 --> 03:51.732

03:51.732 --> 03:53.600

deal with all this

04:37.077 --> 04:38.078

04:38.078 --> 04:39.713

04:39.713 --> 04:41.181
one person will be lost,

04:41.181 --> 04:43.250
the next person will be lost,
the next person will be lost.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.085

either chalk

04:45.085 --> 04:46.419

something like that.

04:46.419 --> 04:48.455

16:53.746 --> 16:56.315
JILL: <i>I'm just so excited</i>
<i>for this whole week.</i>

16:56.315 --> 16:59.352
For months now, the girls
have been dying for more mature,

16:59.352 --> 17:01.487
more edgy choreography.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.756
And with Abby, it's been
really inconsistent.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.492
<i>That's why we're taking a break</i>
<i>from the ALDC.</i>

17:06.492 --> 17:08.661
<i>After all the drama</i>
<i>from last week,</i>

17:08.661 --> 17:10.930
<i>the girls need to go out</i>
<i>on that dance floor</i>

17:10.930 --> 17:13.566
and show people really
what they're capable of.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.901
Brynn, you're gonna be
the first.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.469
Your title's gonna be
"Left Cycle."
Okay.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.803
And, uh, it's just
about, like,

17:17.803 --> 17:19.872
the monotonous, kind of,
quality that you can,

17:19.872 --> 17:21.340
kind of, have
in your life.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.042
Becomes a negative
over time,

17:23.042 --> 17:24.477
so it's your choice
as, like, a dancer

17:24.477 --> 17:26.045
and as a human
to get out of that.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.380
And leave that stuff

17:27.380 --> 17:29.382
that feels like it's not
so progressive for you...

17:29.382 --> 17:30.716
Mm‐hmm.
...behind you.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.084
And then, can continue
forward from that.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.386
Cool!
So, your solo will be
kind of revolving

17:33.386 --> 17:34.620
around that.
Cool?
Cool.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.455
And then, Kendall, you're next.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.624
Yours is gonna be called
"Above So Below."

17:38.624 --> 17:39.792
Cool.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.327
So think about
this idea of, like,

17:41.327 --> 17:44.830
taking things that almost feel
like they're weighing you down

17:44.830 --> 17:45.998
to some sort, right?

17:45.998 --> 17:47.633
Or something that feels, like,
super heavy,

17:47.633 --> 17:49.869
and, kind of, compiling
that below you

17:49.869 --> 17:51.103
to almost create this, like,
foundation for yourself,

17:51.103 --> 17:52.371
to stand up.

17:52.371 --> 17:54.373
And use that negativity
as, like...
Love it.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.676
...support for you to, again,
progress forward, right?

17:58.644 --> 18:00.546
Kalani's‐‐ yours is gonna
be called "False."

recognizing in your life

18:02.748 --> 18:03.916

18:03.916 --> 18:05.751
Ridding yourself of

33:49.694 --> 33:50.896
HOLLY:
Okay, we got to go.
Abby's here.

33:50.896 --> 33:51.897
What?

33:54.599 --> 33:55.600
No, she's not.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.835
KENDALL:
Kalani just texted me

33:56.835 --> 33:58.703
and said, "Abby's here."
NIA: Amazing.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.238
Great.
HOLLY:
It wouldn't change

34:00.238 --> 34:01.840
a thing about your performance.
JILL: Nope, it's not

34:01.840 --> 34:02.941
changing a thing.

34:02.941 --> 34:04.543
(camera clicks)

34:04.543 --> 34:06.144
NIA:
<i>I am super surprised</i>

34:06.144 --> 34:07.145
Abby showed up.

34:07.145 --> 34:09.814
I was not expecting her
to be here.

34:09.814 --> 34:11.283
And, I mean,

34:11.283 --> 34:15.287
<i>I'm gonna do my first ballad,</i>
<i>and this is a lot,</i>

34:15.287 --> 34:16.788
so I'm just gonna stay
in the zone.

this evening?

34:33.838 --> 34:35.073
Yay!
All right.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.474
I just wanted to, uh,

34:36.474 --> 34:38.209
announce I have
a very special guest

34:38.209 --> 34:41.513
that I wanted to bring on stage

Miss Nia Sioux Frazier.

34:44.482 --> 34:47.319
HOLLY: <i>That's gonna be my Nia</i>
<i>on stage, singing.</i>

34:47.319 --> 34:49.120
She's never done
a ballad before.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.856
And, uh, in a ballad,
you hear everything.

34:51.856 --> 34:53.725
<i>It's all on her and her vocals.</i>

34:53.725 --> 34:56.394
<i>So, it's a very...</i>

34:56.394 --> 34:59.631
vulnerable opportunity for her
to put herself out there

34:59.631 --> 35:01.366
as an artist, as a singer.

35:01.366 --> 35:03.101

HOLLY:
<i>I am just so, so proud of her.</i>

36:45.670 --> 36:46.905
She looked like

36:46.905 --> 36:49.407
<i>she was born to perform.</i>

36:49.407 --> 36:50.675
I'm just amazed.

36:50.675 --> 36:52.777
I have to say,
that was so beautiful.

(crowd cheering)

36:55.146 --> 36:56.381
Hats off to you.

You've got a really,
really bright future,

36:58.116 --> 36:59.684
not only in dance,
but also in music.

36:59.684 --> 37:00.985
Oh, thank you.

37:00.985 --> 37:02.220
So, I want to bring
to the stage

another two
special guests.

37:03.555 --> 37:06.658

Miss Kendall Vertes.

JILL: <i>I can't believe</i>
<i>this is happening.</i>

37:20.805 --> 37:22.340
She's probably nervous,

37:22.340 --> 37:25.443
because Abby has spent years
telling her,

37:25.443 --> 37:27.946
"Mm, it's not quite
good enough."

37:27.946 --> 37:31.249
<i>But this is her opportunity</i>

so very much.

39:11.416 --> 39:13.418
(cheering continues)

39:13.418 --> 39:15.220
Yay!
(Nia giggles)

39:15.220 --> 39:17.155
You guys are so good!

39:17.155 --> 39:19.023
I know!
(laughter)

39:19.023 --> 39:21.492
KALANI: I'm a proud mom.
I'm a proud mom.

39:21.492 --> 39:22.694
Nia, you can come sit.

39:22.694 --> 39:23.795
Amazing.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.396
KALANI:
Do you guys feel so relieved?
Yes.

39:25.396 --> 39:26.998
I'm so proud of you guys.

39:26.998 --> 39:29.000
You know, in some ways,
I was so nervous

39:29.000 --> 39:30.935
about Abby being here,
because she's not supportive,

39:30.935 --> 39:32.737
but I am so happy
she's here

39:32.737 --> 39:34.839
to hear you guys.
KIRA: Actually,

39:34.839 --> 39:36.808
she's fake supportive.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.109
I cannot believe

39:38.109 --> 39:39.744
<i>Abby didn't congratulate</i>

39:39.744 --> 39:41.946
<i>Nia and Kendall</i>
<i>for their performance.</i>

39:41.946 --> 39:44.749
<i>That, I am not gonna</i>
<i>stand by and let happen.</i>

39:44.749 --> 39:47.585
HOLLY:
Hello, everyone! Hi!

39:47.585 --> 39:49.020
How are you?

39:49.020 --> 39:50.521
I'm fine, excited.
Are you happy?

39:50.521 --> 39:51.956
I don't know if
you want to go over

39:51.956 --> 39:54.092
and talk to Nia and Kendall

39:54.092 --> 39:55.393
after that fabulous
performance.
It's good.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.228
Is Kendall not performing?

39:57.228 --> 39:59.330
Kendall performed. She...

39:59.330 --> 40:00.365
She just did the...

40:00.365 --> 40:01.866
she just did
the "oohs" and "cry."

40:01.866 --> 40:03.301
I thought she was
doing her own number.
No.

40:03.301 --> 40:05.670
No, she did. She sang.
CHAZ FOLEY:
She sang the second verse.

40:05.670 --> 40:06.838
Yeah, Nia and Kendall
shared the second verse.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.006
Oh. I can't see;
I'm behind them.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.174
So let's not take
that away from Kendall.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.242
Like, Nia and Kendall
both performed.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.911
Good. Good.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.914
But let's save ourselves
and let's be nice and positive.

40:15.914 --> 40:16.948
(laughs)

40:16.948 --> 40:18.416
<i>Here was the moment</i>

40:18.416 --> 40:20.785
<i>for Abby to say</i>
<i>something redeeming,</i>

40:20.785 --> 40:23.855
something that
maybe could change

40:23.855 --> 40:26.424
<i>where we go from here.</i>

40:26.424 --> 40:28.826
<i>And she couldn't bring herself</i>

40:28.826 --> 40:30.628
to take the high road.

40:30.628 --> 40:35.099
And instead, she just, like,
dug the hole that much deeper.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.901
<i>And I am thinking,</i>
<i>at this point,</i>

40:36.901 --> 40:38.036
"Oh, it's on."

40:38.036 --> 40:39.671
<i>We have competition tomorrow</i>

40:39.671 --> 40:40.972
<i>against Abby.</i>

40:40.972 --> 40:42.340
<i>May the best team win.</i>

40:46.511 --> 40:48.079
ABBY LEE:
<i>Next on</i> Dance Moms...

40:48.079 --> 40:50.515
You guys have no loyalty.
To anybody.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.684
This is a team, and they
should be dancing together.

40:52.684 --> 40:53.785
ABBY LEE:
You find the cancer,

40:53.785 --> 40:54.786
you go in,

40:54.786 --> 40:56.387
you cut it out,
you get rid of it.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.824
This is your
coming‐of‐age moment.

40:59.824 --> 41:03.761
<i>Show the world the dancers</i>
<i>that you truly are.</i>

41:03.761 --> 41:05.897
ABBY LEE:
You had no morsel

41:05.897 --> 41:07.665
of respect or dignity!

41:07.665 --> 41:09.767
You screwed your own kids, Abby.

41:10.868 --> 41:12.303
I didn't hate you before,

41:12.303 --> 41:14.639
but I absolutely
do hate you now.
