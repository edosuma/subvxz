STACEY: Ow!

01:07.317 --> 01:08.943
It hurts.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.654
My butt muscles are spasming.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.907
Ow, it hurts so bad.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.493
I feel like a pretzel
gone wrong.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.120
{\an8}Ow, my buttocks.
- You'll be all right, Stacey.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.247
{\an8}Just take her
to the nurse's office.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.500
{\an8}Now you see,
that is a good example

01:23.583 --> 01:24.626
{\an8}of why yoga isn't for everyone.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.127
{\an8}I'll see you all next week.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.422
{\an8}- Poor Stacey.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.256
{\an8}Who gets hurt doing yoga?

01:30.340 --> 01:33.176
{\an8}- Bad stuff always happens
to Stacey.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.135
{\an8}- I know.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.720
{\an8}Remember when
she fell off the roof?

01:35.804 --> 01:37.514
{\an8}- And landed in that rosebush.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.015
{\an8}- Yes.

01:39.098 --> 01:39.599
{\an8}Okay.
That wasn't funny.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.267

a smoothie, wanna come?

01:45.438 --> 01:47.857

is that way.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.526

Later, Zoe.

01:49.609 --> 01:50.109
- Bye.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.531
- See ya.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.159
- Why didn't you tell me

01:58.243 --> 01:59.869
you were friends
with Lisa Perkins?

01:59.953 --> 02:00.995
- Nice to see you, too.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.541
- Do you realize how fine
that girl is?

02:04.624 --> 02:05.625
- How fine is that girl?

02:05.708 --> 02:06.626
- I don't know.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.169
She's off the fine-o-meter.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.713
- Well if you like her so much,
go ask her out.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.965
- No.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.550
She's got a boyfriend.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.342
I respect the man code.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.803
- She broke up
with her boyfriend.

02:16.886 --> 02:17.387
- Lisa's a free agent?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.180
- Uh-huh.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.473
- How come you didn't tell me?

02:20.557 --> 02:21.349
- What'd I just do?

02:21.432 --> 02:21.850
- Oh, man.

I got to make my move.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.604
Where did she go?

02:26.688 --> 02:28.273
- That way, to get a smoothie.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.440
- Yes!

02:30.441 --> 02:32.026
Wait.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.486
What do I say to her?

02:33.570 --> 02:34.571
- Just be yourself.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.406
You know, but funnier
and more charming.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.490

02:38.700 --> 02:40.201
Wait.
I gotta hurry.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.119
Can I borrow your Jet X?

02:57.677 --> 02:58.845
Come on.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.013
- Don't redline, man,

03:00.096 --> 03:01.014
you'll blow your motor.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.223

03:03.182 --> 03:03.892
- And hello, finish line.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.102
My name is Chase Matthews,

03:08.313 --> 03:10.356

Logan Reese.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.816
- Okay, you're the worst.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.401
- Nope, I believe I'm the best,

03:13.484 --> 03:14.694
as indicated
by the top 10 high scores

03:14.777 --> 03:17.322
on <i> your</i> video game.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.781

03:18.865 --> 03:19.908
Yeah, you're a real bad driver

03:19.991 --> 03:22.744
when it's video game go-karts.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.162
- And your point is?

03:24.245 --> 03:25.288
- If it were the real deal,

03:25.371 --> 03:27.206
I'd smoke you like a salmon.

03:27.290 --> 03:27.916
- Okay.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.167
A, I prefer my salmon poached,

03:29.250 --> 03:32.712
and b, if we were driving
real go-karts,

03:32.795 --> 03:34.714
I'd beat you worse.

03:34.797 --> 03:35.924
- Yeah, wanna bet?

03:36.007 --> 03:37.091
- Anytime.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.760
- Can you get yourself
a go-kart?

03:38.843 --> 03:40.136
- I can if you can.
- Good.

03:40.219 --> 03:41.930
Get one.

these bendy straws.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.580

04:07.664 --> 04:09.207
- Oh, hi, Michael.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.459
- See you got yourself
a smoothie.

Good call.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.671

come back later?

05:55.146 --> 05:56.481

06:27.095 --> 06:29.013
- Why'd you bring my Jet X
in here?

06:29.097 --> 06:30.681

06:43.528 --> 06:44.028
- How's it <i> my</i> fault?

06:44.112 --> 06:44.946

Oh, how cute.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.161
- It's not cute.

I can't even talk to the girl

- Hmm, worse comes to worse,

07:19.564 --> 07:21.149
he can just take off the pants.

- Ah, yeah.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.497
What's up with the crutches?

08:18.581 --> 08:20.416
- I had a little accident
in yoga class.

08:20.499 --> 08:22.001
I sprained my left glute.

I'm sorry about your glute.
