WEBVTT

00:19.019 --> 00:20.478
Let go of me!

00:20.563 --> 00:21.980
Where's my husband?

00:22.064 --> 00:24.316
We can't leave him there!
We have to go back!

00:24.399 --> 00:25.901
Shut her up, Marcy.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.529
We'll have to do more than that.
We can't have her remember any of this.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.114
Sooner or later, I'll need to give her
an HDAC2 inhibitor.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.282
What?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.742
Who the hell are you people?
Let go of me!

00:33.826 --> 00:35.703
Can you hurry up?
She's stronger than she looks.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.830
It's coming.
Could you at least slow down a little?

00:37.913 --> 00:40.874
We can't be tied to the crash site
in any of the media reports.

00:40.958 --> 00:43.168
Kathryn! Just relax.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.670
How do you know my name?

00:45.588 --> 00:47.422
Okay. Listen to me.

00:47.505 --> 00:50.718
My husband was on that flight.
He's with the FBI.

00:50.801 --> 00:54.387
He had this device,
that's what saved me, and...

00:56.890 --> 00:59.309
That should buy us some silence
until I can administer the inhibitor.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.894
I don't know how he stands her.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.356
Boss, are you there?

01:04.439 --> 01:06.692
MacLaren can't possibly
hear you.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.528
In fact, I doubt the G-forces
of an impact like that are survivable.

01:10.613 --> 01:11.947
Somebody thinks it is.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.199
The EMTs who took him were our people.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.325
They had to be.

01:15.408 --> 01:18.411
She's right. They had to have known
when and where the plane was coming down.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.707
The director would've assigned a team
to resuscitate him and Bishop.

01:21.790 --> 01:22.875
Try his cell phone.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.093
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Who is this?

01:33.176 --> 01:35.595
<i>Deal with the wife, then come to OPs ASAP.</i>

01:35.679 --> 01:36.930
Is he alive?

01:37.014 --> 01:40.225
<i>Clean up the mess you created,</i>
<i>then we'll talk about the next steps.</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:01.538
Should I put her
in bed properly?

02:01.622 --> 02:02.623
You don't have to whisper.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.917
You could scream at the top of your lungs
and she wouldn't hear you.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.627
Especially after I give her this.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.841
Do you have a memory inhibitor
in your bag?

02:12.925 --> 02:14.176
Yeah, every traveler medic has to have

02:14.259 --> 02:15.552
a few doses on hand
in case of emergencies.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.179
How much will she forget?

02:17.262 --> 02:18.639
Most of yesterday.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.767
I do not envy the hangover
she's about to wake up with.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.020
Okay, grab a pair of shoes for him, too,
then go help Philip set the scene.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.658
Oh, the fun they had.

02:37.741 --> 02:41.536
How much alcohol would it take for someone
to black out the previous day?

02:41.619 --> 02:43.246
I don't know.
I only use heroin.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.208
Let's go with "lots."

03:06.061 --> 03:08.521
You can put the weapon down.
We're not a threat.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.606
Who are you?

03:09.689 --> 03:11.024
Traveler D13.

03:11.649 --> 03:12.901
"D"?

03:12.985 --> 03:14.737
D is for doctor.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.488
Also, in my case, Derek.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.323
I thought your team was reserved
for heads of state.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.867
That was our first mission, yes.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.620
But now we save whoever
the director tells us to save, worldwide.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.122
We've already started the work.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.546
Can he be saved?

03:34.339 --> 03:36.466
If we can stabilize him,
stop his internal hemorrhaging,

03:36.549 --> 03:39.136
replace or rebuild
one or more of his organs,

03:39.219 --> 03:42.180
assuming one of you is a suitable
living donor and willing to volunteer.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.431
Of course.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.475
Then maybe.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.011
Oh...

04:24.056 --> 04:26.058
Ow. Oh, my...

04:48.121 --> 04:49.414
Grant?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.213
Grant?

06:18.628 --> 06:20.088
He looks a lot better
than he did last night.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.967
On the outside.
That's the easy part.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.261
But all the damage is on the inside.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.430
His brain, his major organs.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.182
Took all night just to stabilize him.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.518
They don't really look like
they're working on him at all.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.104
That's because nano technology's
doing most of the work.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.315
Really? Graphene-based?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.816
As advanced as I've ever seen.

06:39.899 --> 06:43.278
I mean, without them,
with that amount of internal damage...

06:43.361 --> 06:45.155
he wouldn't have stood a chance.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.907
But even a full suite of medical nanites
can only do so much.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.203
Well, I'm in over my head here,

06:51.286 --> 06:53.455
and there are more loose ends
I gotta clean up, so...

06:53.538 --> 06:54.914
Where are you going?

06:54.998 --> 06:56.666
The airport.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.793
If he wasn't on the plane,
why is his car parked there?

06:58.876 --> 07:00.628
Right. Go.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.925
All right, 0115, you're up.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.178
Ready when you are, Derek.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.679
We've grown it to the first stage,

07:09.762 --> 07:12.099
but we have to grow the organ
the rest of the way internally.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.517
Yeah, where you growing it?
You have to cut me open?

07:14.601 --> 07:15.936
Cut you? No.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.396
It'll find its own way.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.023
I don't really like the sound of that.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.734
You're not gonna like
how it feels, either. Lay down, please.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.325
This is gonna hurt a lot.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.082
I'm scrubbing in.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.792
You're welcome to, but it's not necessary.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.254
He's the leader of my team.
I wasn't asking for permission.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.402
I... pay here?

09:30.487 --> 09:33.490
You, uh, mind if I look at your license
and registration, please, sir?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.493
Right, I should have that...

09:40.788 --> 09:43.666
Just, uh, picking it up for a friend.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.876
Uh-huh.

09:45.710 --> 09:49.297
It says here this vehicle is registered
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.007
That's who my friend works for.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.467
Step out of the vehicle,
please, sir.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.512
Is there a problem?
I have his key.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.971
Uh, Grant MacLaren's--

09:57.054 --> 09:58.390
Yeah, you read that
on the registration.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.100
Now step out of the vehicle.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.860
Turn around.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.116
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.087
Do you mind opening
the gate, please?

11:11.754 --> 11:13.673
Adding stage-3 nanites.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.727
I've never seen that before.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.400
Are you all right?

11:32.484 --> 11:33.776
Absolutely.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.830
Now let's see if this pancreas
needs to be replaced.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.586
Ready suction?

12:14.276 --> 12:15.818
We're getting close.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.529
The bathrooms are done.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.197
The kitchen looks great.

12:21.616 --> 12:24.369
This place is gonna feel
like home in no time.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.789
Oh, what?
Is the vacuum cleaner broken?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.291
No, I don't think so.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.709
Just sucked up something
underneath the couch.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.252
Oh. Got it.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.839
Oops.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.010
Don't look at me.
It's your fault they're under there.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.970
I'm just worried
I'm gonna find your bra in here next.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.306
Stop.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.506
We need another unit of blood.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.758
I'll go get it.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.650
You still with me?

13:38.860 --> 13:40.152
What?

13:40.236 --> 13:41.696
You've been quiet.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.574
I was thinking...

13:44.657 --> 13:49.036
- About never trying bodysurfing again?
- There's that.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.832
Whenever I'm on vacation
for any length of time,

13:52.915 --> 13:56.503
I just start thinking about how much more
I could be doing with my life.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.795
Like?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.297
I don't know.

14:00.382 --> 14:03.385
My dad was a cop, now I'm FBI.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.762
I mean, Jesus.
Talk about lack of imagination.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.263
But you love the FBI.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.765
Well... like.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.559
And you're really good at it.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.019
So I keep telling you.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.314
Well, maybe you're just ready
for a new challenge

14:17.399 --> 14:19.066
that doesn't have to come from your work.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.778
Oh, God, we're about to have
the baby discussion again.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.696
-Did I even say the word?
-Oh, it's so...

14:23.780 --> 14:25.407
-I can see it all over you.
-Stop!

14:25.490 --> 14:27.617
It's in your eyes.
I know that look.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.912
Oh, shoot.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.457
We've got a flat tire.
It's okay.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.958
How's he doing?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.839
Sternal fracture...

14:41.923 --> 14:44.175
hemothorax and pulmonary contusion.

14:44.258 --> 14:47.429
Whatever. I mean, how's it looking?

14:47.512 --> 14:48.888
Is he gonna be all right?

14:48.971 --> 14:51.307
It's way too soon to say.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.892
We've barely started.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.271
Plus... there's a problem with his heart.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.856
-What's wrong?
-It's damaged...

14:58.940 --> 15:00.733
beyond the nanite repair capability.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.445
The director wouldn't have sent them
if there wasn't a chance.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.948
The director's not infallible.

15:07.031 --> 15:10.367
But he is in the best hands
I know of in any century.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.498
Okay.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.474
Did you find it?

15:32.557 --> 15:33.850
Hmm? Oh.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.309
Yeah, that's it. Thanks.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.145
Yeah.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.609
I wish I could be more helpful.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.569
You are helping.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.404
Yeah, clearly you'd be lost without me.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.577
I really would be, Grant.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.588
Hey.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.172
I just got a call from local PD.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.258
Parking attendant called in
a vehicle theft.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.260
License plate matches Mac's SUV.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.345
Seriously?
I just texted him.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.847
Maybe he doesn't know yet.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.232
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Special Agent Grant MacLaren--</i>

16:48.424 --> 16:49.425
Hello?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.468
Hey, Kat. It's Walt.
Is Mac with you?

16:52.303 --> 16:55.097
-I thought he was with you.
<i>-No.</i>

16:55.181 --> 16:57.183
I guess we're getting our wires crossed.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.768
Look, sorry to bother you.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.520
Uh, wait. I...

17:16.160 --> 17:17.579
Hello.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.847
Shit.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.561
Hey... You don't look good.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.312
Thanks.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.815
-I'm serious.
-I can tell.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.859
You should lie down.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.986
<i>Guys?</i>

17:50.069 --> 17:51.195
What is it, Philip?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.280
We have a situation.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.533
<i>-I need an evac.</i>
-How fast?

17:56.618 --> 17:58.703
Now?

17:58.786 --> 18:02.123
<i>All right. Hang tight.</i>
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

18:03.708 --> 18:05.752
You need to tell the doctor.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.003
Maybe something isn't right.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.131
Derek? He's the one who told me
it was gonna hurt.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.924
They can give you something.

18:12.884 --> 18:15.678
Little pain
toward a good cause...

18:15.762 --> 18:18.472
A lot of pain
toward a good cause.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.019
Go help Philip. I'm fine.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.278
The nanites have nearly
repaired the pancreas.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.489
Good. But if they can't
normalize his neural activity,

18:35.572 --> 18:37.324
it won't matter how well we fix his body.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.168
Okay, good.
Now it's time to take the shot.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.294
All right?

18:48.377 --> 18:51.798
I need you to stand as still as possible.

18:51.881 --> 18:52.882
All right?

18:52.965 --> 18:56.177
Apply gentle but steady pressure
to the trigger.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.596
The shot should
almost come as a surprise, okay?

18:59.681 --> 19:02.058
Your breathing should stay--

19:02.141 --> 19:03.392
Surprise!

19:03.475 --> 19:06.062
Kat, you need to take firearms seriously.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.189
I'll show you how serious I am.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.816
And you need to keep
your barrel downrange.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.943
Mmm, you need to keep
your barrel downrange.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.360
You said you wanted to do this,

19:13.444 --> 19:15.112
-but if you don't...
-No. I do. I do...

19:15.196 --> 19:16.781
I like it here. It feels dangerous.

19:16.864 --> 19:17.949
'Cause it is dangerous.

19:18.032 --> 19:19.909
-Now, come on.
-Okay. Okay. Let me try again.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.661
All right.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.706
-Now, take your aim.
-Mmm-hmm.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.666
- And gently...
- Ooh!

19:26.749 --> 19:28.625
...squeeze the trigger.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.089
Oh, my God!
I shot a gun.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.632
- Come on, two more shots.
- Okay.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.097
Hey! Look at that.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.266
Five shots,
and the target's completely unscathed.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.727
That is a record.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.311
Oh...

19:47.394 --> 19:49.355
I'm not sure I like that I liked that.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.648
Well, you did it.
You don't have to like it.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.735
I like that I like you.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.237
Like? Really?
That's... that's the best you got?

19:56.320 --> 19:58.030
Really, really like?

19:58.114 --> 19:59.907
Kinda prefer a different word.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.492
Want?

20:01.575 --> 20:02.869
Oh, I hadn't thought of that word.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.037
-Need?
-That's even better.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.413
-Now?
-Yeah.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.415
That's my favorite one so far.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.495
I need you to run
a facial recognition check.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.415
This is the guy who took off
with Mac's SUV.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.418
Well, I'll give you this one for free.
That's Philip Pearson.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.211
Your partner had me run him
a few weeks ago.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.881
Are you sure that's him?

20:56.964 --> 20:59.383
Yeah, MacLaren got all aggro
about it.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.803
Won't be forgetting that face
any time soon.

21:01.886 --> 21:02.970
That's Philip Pearson.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.092
I've started to worry

21:41.175 --> 21:42.927
that we're gonna regret
not having children.

21:43.886 --> 21:47.139
Are you having actual regret,
or just the fear of having regret?

21:48.557 --> 21:52.394
The fear one, I think.
What about you?

21:52.478 --> 21:53.855
I'm gonna plead the fifth.

21:54.939 --> 21:58.067
Grant, we haven't talked about it in ages,
and we're getting older.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.861
You can say that again.

21:59.944 --> 22:03.697
But there's new technologies.
It's amazing what they can do now.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.325
And you'd be such a great dad.

22:10.121 --> 22:13.833
I think you're forgetting
how hard it was for us.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.960
You mean for me.

22:16.043 --> 22:20.631
Well, it took us a long time
to climb out of it.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.884
I know.

22:22.967 --> 22:26.262
And I... I'm pulling
these 60-hour weeks lately.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.389
All right, I get it.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.974
I just...

22:34.979 --> 22:38.190
I'm afraid that if it happened again...

22:39.691 --> 22:41.527
I know. I just...

22:41.610 --> 22:42.904
I know.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.162
You're gonna be late.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.165
Yeah.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.804
Beth here.

23:08.887 --> 23:12.183
Walt, Mac's SUV was found dumped
in a back-alley parking lot,

23:12.266 --> 23:13.475
suspect not on scene.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.438
-They bringing it in?
-Not anytime soon.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.442
You're not answering your phone.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.235
Kat, I'm sorry, it's been busy.

23:23.319 --> 23:24.946
Do you know where he is, Walt?

23:25.029 --> 23:26.072
Not yet.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.198
He's not with me. He's not with you,

23:28.282 --> 23:31.077
although, apparently, we both have
messages saying otherwise.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.370
Right.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.039
You wanna walk with me?

23:40.169 --> 23:41.337
If we sounded the alarm

23:41.420 --> 23:43.714
every time an agent's whereabouts
were unknown for a few hours...

23:43.797 --> 23:45.299
What I don't get is the lies.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.675
It could be anything
at this point in time.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.053
Right now, all we know
is his SUV's been stolen.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.304
Wait. What?

24:01.815 --> 24:04.151
I'm at the pick-up spot.
Where are you?

24:04.235 --> 24:06.945
I'm in an alley one block south.

24:07.029 --> 24:08.572
Police are close.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.657
<i>All right, I'm coming.</i>

24:15.329 --> 24:16.998
Police, west entrance.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.224
Oh, God. Aah!

24:35.307 --> 24:37.268
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.062
I spilled hot coffee on myself.

24:42.064 --> 24:44.816
Oh! Oh, I'm in your way,
aren't I?

24:44.900 --> 24:46.735
Uh, sorry. Sorry.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.779
Um, hang on, hang on.

25:22.063 --> 25:23.397
Thanks.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.000
MacLaren.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.295
I got it.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.548
All right. I'll be there.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.515
Oh, good.
This takes forever with one person.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.725
How do corporate clients
always seem to know

26:41.808 --> 26:43.644
which materials aren't in stock?

26:47.148 --> 26:48.274
Now?

26:48.357 --> 26:49.566
All hands on deck.

26:49.650 --> 26:52.403
-But I booked those hands in advance.
-I know.

26:52.486 --> 26:53.779
I'm sorry.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.448
Sorry.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.033
What do you want me to do?

26:58.116 --> 26:59.868
You can not pick up your phone for once.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.578
Yeah, and they could not give me
a paycheck,

27:01.662 --> 27:03.955
which only pays for everything we have.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.000
You're right.

27:07.083 --> 27:10.587
I should be happy that I get to spend
any time at all with you

27:10.671 --> 27:13.006
and grateful
that I'm so well provided for.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.633
-That is not what I meant.
-Yeah, it is, Grant.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.427
-It's exactly what you meant.
-Kat...

27:16.510 --> 27:18.303
You know what?
Just, please, go to work.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.348
What do you...

27:45.914 --> 27:48.166
That explains
why we lost his GPS.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.962
So, you notice anything out of place?

27:53.505 --> 27:54.548
No.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.759
Well, at least there's no sign
of a struggle.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.971
Jesus. I hadn't even considered that.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.557
Oh, sorry, professional reflex.

28:04.475 --> 28:06.227
You know what the weirdest part is?

28:06.310 --> 28:08.103
It doesn't feel completely unexpected.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.396
What do you mean?

28:10.731 --> 28:13.066
Lately, I found myself questioning things

28:13.149 --> 28:15.694
I didn't think
had any mystery left in them...

28:15.777 --> 28:17.238
like my husband.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.949
Oh, God, Walt.
Maybe I'm losing my mind.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.369
No, you're not losing your mind.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.079
I've noticed some things myself.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.789
Really?

28:27.873 --> 28:30.459
Little things, like all of a sudden
he's a much better shot.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.380
He's suddenly much better
at a lot of things.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.343
Yeah...

28:39.426 --> 28:40.886
Definitely not squash.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.477
Last night, we...

28:50.854 --> 28:52.564
What? What happened?

28:52.648 --> 28:55.442
That's the thing.
I don't really know.

28:56.652 --> 29:01.615
I woke up to a disaster of a kitchen
full of empty wine bottles, but...

29:02.699 --> 29:04.743
I don't remember attending the party.

29:05.369 --> 29:08.163
I mean, it's not unusual for us
to have a glass of wine or two

29:08.247 --> 29:10.291
if he gets home at a decent hour, but...

29:11.542 --> 29:14.503
he sent me a text this morning,
said that I was in "rare form."

29:15.671 --> 29:17.798
Well, Kat, you can be pretty entertaining
when you've had a few.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.883
But I don't remember having anything!

29:21.343 --> 29:25.013
I mean...
I woke up this morning feeling hungover,

29:25.096 --> 29:28.224
but never in my life
have I been blackout drunk,

29:28.309 --> 29:30.894
certainly not
on a Tuesday night at home.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.732
It's like my life derailed,
but nothing happened.

29:36.858 --> 29:39.445
Look, maybe you're just stressed.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.740
Let me drive you back to your car.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.909
You sure you don't want
to drive me to the asylum?

29:45.992 --> 29:48.119
That is way out of my way.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.964
They're gonna be looking for me.
I'll get eyes on Forbes.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.508
Okay, hold him down.

30:01.592 --> 30:04.135
Okay. Clamps.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.012
Pass me the gauze.

30:07.431 --> 30:09.641
We can't wait.
We've gotta do this.

30:11.727 --> 30:12.853
Scalpel.

30:17.566 --> 30:18.859
It's time.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.902
Time?

30:20.986 --> 30:22.654
Come on, old man, you got this.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.032
I'm beginning to see
that time is like a river...

30:26.116 --> 30:29.578
That you can throw the biggest rock
that you can find into the river,

30:29.661 --> 30:32.163
but the water just goes around the rock.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.082
It's not optimal, but we have no choice.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.377
...and it continues downstream...

30:37.711 --> 30:39.755
as if the rock...

30:39.838 --> 30:41.423
was never there.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.675
Time to go.

30:56.397 --> 30:58.189
What're you doing?

30:58.273 --> 30:59.483
What does it look like?

30:59.566 --> 31:01.192
No. Just leave it.

31:02.944 --> 31:05.489
I don't know how healthy it is
to leave all this stuff out.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.782
You weren't sure whether we should

31:06.865 --> 31:08.324
set the nursery up
before the baby was born.

31:08.409 --> 31:09.951
You're gonna throw that in my face, too?

31:10.035 --> 31:12.287
No. Come on!

31:12.371 --> 31:13.955
Just leave it.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.290
I wanna deal with it.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.667
You should be resting.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.585
Oh, God, I am sick of resting.

31:18.669 --> 31:21.171
I'm just putting some stuff away for now.
If you want to help--

31:21.254 --> 31:22.673
Why?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.134
Aren't we gonna try again?

31:28.595 --> 31:31.640
Was that it? It's over?

31:33.434 --> 31:35.727
Every time you pass this room...

31:35.811 --> 31:37.813
you stand in the doorway and you stare.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.606
Yeah, I did that before.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.983
Well, I think maybe
it meant something different

31:42.067 --> 31:43.860
before you lost the baby.

31:43.944 --> 31:46.863
No, before we lost the baby.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.157
This isn't just something
that happened to me.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.327
You're absolutely right about that.

31:54.204 --> 31:55.789
Because I almost lost you.

31:57.749 --> 32:01.795
I spent a whole day and night
in a hospital room alone

32:01.878 --> 32:04.673
waiting to see whether or not
you were gonna make it.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.718
I was sad we lost the baby,

32:07.801 --> 32:12.514
but just the thought of losing you
was so much worse.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.894
And I'm sorry if that makes me
a selfish asshole, but...

32:19.938 --> 32:21.397
Yeah.

32:21.482 --> 32:23.108
I'm putting a few things away.

32:56.432 --> 32:58.810
It's not like we haven't heard
from him today.

32:58.894 --> 33:00.812
If even you don't know where he is...

33:00.896 --> 33:02.397
We don't keep tabs on each other.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.940
He doesn't know where I am
half the time either.

33:04.024 --> 33:06.735
His vehicle was stolen
and he's not answering the phone.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.695
We will figure it out, Kat, okay?

33:08.779 --> 33:11.072
I will tell you the minute
that we hear anything.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.200
-All right? No problem.
-Thanks, Walt.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.957
-Forbes.
<i>-Yeah, hi. It's Beth.</i>

33:21.041 --> 33:22.626
-Go ahead.
<i>-I, uh...</i>

33:22.709 --> 33:25.211
<i>I found something on Mac.</i>
<i>You're gonna want to see this.</i>

33:25.295 --> 33:26.713
Okay, I'm on my way up.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.991
- Kathryn?
- Yes.

33:56.326 --> 33:57.536
And no.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.039
Do you understand?

34:06.002 --> 34:07.588
These aren't my memories.

34:07.671 --> 34:08.964
No.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.218
-I'm not Grant MacLaren.
-No.

34:14.553 --> 34:15.721
And yes.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.641
These were his memories.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.185
Only the brightest shards...

34:22.268 --> 34:24.187
fragmented and incoherent.

34:24.896 --> 34:28.233
Orphaned neurons of your host's mind
cut off from you.

34:28.316 --> 34:30.611
Normally, you never would have had
access to them.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.112
Why now?

34:34.447 --> 34:36.366
You are very near death.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.120
I can feel it.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.080
We're trying to save you.

34:42.163 --> 34:45.208
Tens of thousands of nanites
working in concert

34:45.291 --> 34:49.212
to repair damage to your prefrontal cortex
and throughout the rest of your body.

34:49.295 --> 34:53.508
Your consciousness was given access
to these memories as a refuge.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.512
-Show me more.
-There are no more.

34:58.972 --> 35:01.057
Those were the last remnants of him.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.813
I loved you so much.

35:07.522 --> 35:08.732
He did.

35:09.983 --> 35:12.903
They're his memories, not yours.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.239
So why can't I tell the difference?

35:25.248 --> 35:26.667
Cross-clamping the aorta.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.377
Okay. Here we go. Scalpel.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.846
Tissue is presenting normally,
but it's fibrillating.

35:42.348 --> 35:43.850
Let's get it in and get it charged.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.201
Hey. Check your email.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.494
- What'd you find?
- Mac's GPS data.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.996
Uploaded to the cloud.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.333
Everywhere MacLaren's SUV has been
in the past month and a half.

36:09.918 --> 36:13.046
- I marked a few places of interest.
- This is great.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.923
I pulled Philip Pearson's file.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.466
Saw his lawyer is Ray Green.

36:17.633 --> 36:19.635
Why am I not surprised?

36:19.720 --> 36:21.763
Guess who bought an old garage
up near the tracks

36:21.847 --> 36:23.264
the day after his client won the lottery?

36:24.933 --> 36:26.517
MacLaren's been there
a bunch of times.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.312
There you go.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.480
Oh, shit.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.065
- <i>I'll get started on a warrant.</i>
- Shit!

36:33.984 --> 36:35.235
We have to move!

36:36.027 --> 36:37.487
What?

36:37.570 --> 36:38.739
MacLaren's partner's coming.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.782
Do you know what
they're doing to him in there?

36:40.866 --> 36:42.826
-The mission comes first.
-Stop him.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.620
I can hack into the system,
slow him down with the warrant,

36:45.704 --> 36:48.331
stall him for a couple hours, maybe,

36:48.414 --> 36:49.958
but eventually, he will be coming!

36:54.921 --> 36:56.923
Why these memories?

36:57.007 --> 36:58.508
They could be random...

36:59.425 --> 37:02.262
or these memories were so strong
they survived your arrival.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.018
What's happening?

37:08.101 --> 37:09.685
It's time to go.

37:09.770 --> 37:11.104
Go where?

37:12.272 --> 37:14.149
We'll see.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.527
Are you coming?

37:17.610 --> 37:19.112
No.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.656
And yes.

37:27.788 --> 37:30.290
- He's not responding!
- Charge again.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.667
Clear!

37:35.378 --> 37:37.463
- Again!
- Charge!

37:37.547 --> 37:38.589
Clear!

37:50.226 --> 37:51.812
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Special Agent Grant MacLaren.</i>

37:51.895 --> 37:53.438
<i>- Please leave a message.</i>

37:54.647 --> 37:56.024
Jesus, Mac.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.279
Hello?

38:48.784 --> 38:50.203
Can I help you?

38:51.579 --> 38:52.998
I'm looking for Philip Pearson.

38:53.873 --> 38:56.125
Uh... who?

38:56.209 --> 38:57.627
Pearson. I know he's here.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.004
And you are?

38:59.921 --> 39:02.340
Special Agent Forbes.

39:02.423 --> 39:03.716
FBI.

39:05.801 --> 39:07.762
Well, in that case,
I'm gonna need to see a warrant.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.056
Tell me again
why I shouldn't take you in.

39:10.140 --> 39:13.684
You know why. I'm a hacker.
How am I gonna do that from jail?

39:13.768 --> 39:14.978
Mac?

39:16.521 --> 39:18.023
Now look what you've done.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.942
What's going on?

39:21.026 --> 39:22.735
Someone needs to be reminded

39:22.818 --> 39:25.696
of the dynamics
of our working relationship.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.490
You're working with this kid?

39:27.573 --> 39:29.825
No, no, no.
He's working for me.

39:29.910 --> 39:31.912
A distinction that seems
to have slipped his mind.

39:31.995 --> 39:34.455
I was just trying to show you
how vulnerable you are.

39:34.539 --> 39:35.957
You shut up.

39:36.041 --> 39:39.669
Mr. Pearson is one of my
confidential informants

39:39.752 --> 39:41.337
on the hacking case I was working.

39:41.421 --> 39:45.841
I promised to keep him out of the system
if he promised to stop breaking the law.

39:45.926 --> 39:49.137
Did I or did I not prove to you
that I could steal your car?

39:49.220 --> 39:50.430
You don't even have a license.

39:50.513 --> 39:51.806
I can make one of those, too.

39:52.473 --> 39:55.185
He claims that if he could hack my life,
bad guys could, too.

39:55.268 --> 39:57.645
I'm telling you, man,
you guys are not secure.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.064
Yeah, all right, that's enough.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.316
Hey, thanks for the tip on my car, Walt.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.443
Wasn't hard to figure out who did it.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.111
Why didn't you call me back?

40:05.195 --> 40:07.030
-You didn't get my texts?
-No, I didn't get them.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.781
I texted you, like, three times.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.867
Uh, sorry, guys.

40:11.952 --> 40:14.913
He didn't get them.
They were redirected.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.165
I was proving a point.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.459
I'm gonna need
to call off the cavalry.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.794
-Everyone's out there looking for you.
-What?

40:21.877 --> 40:23.546
You went offline and your car was stolen.

40:23.629 --> 40:25.924
Oh, Jesus.
Are you listening to this?

40:26.007 --> 40:27.175
I did you a favor.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.470
How do you people not see that?
Your security is shit!

40:31.221 --> 40:34.057
You're probably vulnerable, too.
My fee is extremely reasonable.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.475
If you weren't his CI...

40:35.558 --> 40:36.559
Shh, shh.

40:36.642 --> 40:38.269
I'm sorry.
I had no idea he's doing this.

40:38.353 --> 40:39.479
Look, it's not like I don't have

40:39.562 --> 40:41.314
anything better to do
than chase your ass all over town.

40:41.397 --> 40:42.773
I'll make it up to you.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.070
It's not me that you have to worry about.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.738
Call your wife.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.828
Uh... Walt!

41:06.089 --> 41:08.549
"Your fee is extremely reasonable?"

41:08.633 --> 41:09.842
I was improvising!

41:09.925 --> 41:11.302
But I think we pulled it off.

41:11.386 --> 41:12.762
Thought I was
gonna pass out.

41:12.845 --> 41:13.972
You've had enough of that
for one day.

41:14.055 --> 41:15.306
The nanites still have a few hours' work.

41:15.390 --> 41:16.682
You have no business being on your feet.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.893
So I should take a sick day,
is that what you're saying?

41:18.977 --> 41:21.437
I'm saying, if you want
to avoid external scarring,

41:21.521 --> 41:23.814
you have rest for at least two more hours,

41:23.898 --> 41:26.859
and no sexual activity
for the next 36 hours,

41:26.942 --> 41:29.070
until the nanites have left your system.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.782
Well, I'll try to restrain myself.

41:37.287 --> 41:39.122
-Thank you.
-It was our pleasure.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.707
How about hooking me up
with some of that sweet nano tech?

41:41.791 --> 41:43.834
Nanites are by directive only.
Sorry.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.546
-I got school tomorrow, Derek!
-Lucky you.

41:46.629 --> 41:50.425
We have to fly across the world
to save the life of a genocidal dictator.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.801
Why would you do that?

41:51.884 --> 41:54.303
Presumably, he's better
than the alternative.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.809
It was a pleasure working with you, 3569.

41:59.892 --> 42:02.228
-Same here.
-Get some rest.

42:02.312 --> 42:04.355
And... I wanted you to know,

42:04.439 --> 42:05.690
if there was anything
we could do for you...

42:05.773 --> 42:07.358
Yeah. It's all right.

42:08.276 --> 42:09.569
I understand.

42:09.652 --> 42:12.238
Take care of yourselves.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.215
Kat?

42:34.385 --> 42:35.803
Hello?

42:39.474 --> 42:40.683
Kat?

42:42.602 --> 42:44.019
You home?

42:51.694 --> 42:54.114
There you are.
I tried your cell phone.

42:54.197 --> 42:56.741
I turned it off.
Now you know how it feels.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.201
I know, I'm sorry.

42:58.284 --> 43:01.371
I couldn't stop myself from checking it
to see if you were alive or dead,

43:01.454 --> 43:04.374
and it was making me crazy,
so I shut it off.

43:04.457 --> 43:07.460
And then I found myself enjoying
the feeling, so I kept it off.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.587
Well, it's actually a funny story.

43:09.670 --> 43:12.090
My CI stole my car.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.509
-He hacked into my phone--
-You know what, you can tell me tomorrow.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.177
I'm sure it's an interesting story,

43:16.261 --> 43:19.472
but right now I'm tired,
and I wanna have a bath.

43:21.015 --> 43:24.018
You need me to wash your back, or...
