04:03.075 --> 04:05.510
LISTEN. FOR THE NEW TILES
IN THE BATHROOM-

04:05.578 --> 04:08.813
DO YOU LIKE THE ASH
OR THE GRAY?

04:08.880 --> 04:12.150
HMM. I'M GONNA SAY ASH 'CAUSE
IT SOUNDS LIKE A BAD WORD.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.187
ASH.

04:17.356 --> 04:19.089
THANKS FOR

04:23.696 --> 04:25.463
WHOA, WHOA. WE CAN'T GO ON SATURDAY.

04:25.531 --> 04:26.564
WHY NOT?

04:26.632 --> 04:27.381
'CAUSE JARED,
THE NEW DRIVER,

04:27.449 --> 04:28.799
HE'S HAVIN'
A BARBECUE.

04:28.867 --> 04:29.901
OH, OK.
WHAT TIME IS IT?

04:29.969 --> 04:31.386
I DON'T KNOW.
WHERE IS IT?

04:31.454 --> 04:33.004
I'M NOT SURE.
WHEN WILL YOU KNOW?

04:33.072 --> 04:34.906
CAN'T SAY.

04:34.974 --> 04:38.058
WHAT KEEPS ME
FROM CHEATING ON YOU?

04:38.827 --> 04:40.111
THE THING IS,
HE'S INVITED

04:40.178 --> 04:41.445
ALMOST EVERYBODY ELSE BUT ME.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.247
IT JUST
- I DON'T KNOW. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

04:43.315 --> 04:46.901
OH. WELL... MAYBE THE GUY
JUST DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

04:48.053 --> 04:49.654
WHAT?!

04:51.089 --> 04:54.091
OK. CAR-CARRIE, DO YOU
REALIZE WHO I AM AT WORK?

04:54.159 --> 04:56.661
I MEAN, PEOPLE FIGHT TO SIT
NEXT TO ME AT THE LUNCH TABLE.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.529
I MEAN, EVERYBODY
THINKS I'M-

04:58.597 --> 04:59.864
AND I'M A LITTLE BIT
EMBARRASSED TO SAY IT-

04:59.931 --> 05:01.632
DELIGHTFUL.

05:02.568 --> 05:04.619
O... K.

05:04.686 --> 05:06.888
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?
I GOT IT.

05:06.956 --> 05:08.339
HE'S PROBABLY
- HE'S PROBABLY AFRAID TO INVITE ME

05:08.407 --> 05:10.008
'CAUSE HE THINKS
I'M GONNA SAY NO.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.994
THAT'S, UH... YEAH.
I'M LIKE THE PRETTY GIRL

05:13.061 --> 05:14.528
WHO DOESN'T GET ASKED
TO THE PROM.

05:16.599 --> 05:19.801
WOW. THAT'S ONE
ROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

05:19.868 --> 05:22.286
HONEY, COME ON. SO ONE GUY
AT WORK DOESN'T LIKE YOU?

05:22.354 --> 05:23.771
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

05:23.839 --> 05:25.657
B- BECAUSE IT
BOTHERS ME. OK?

05:25.725 --> 05:26.924
BELIEVE ME, I WISH I
COULD BE MORE LIKE YOU,

05:26.992 --> 05:28.393
JUST LET IT
ROLL OFF MY BACK.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.627
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:29.695 --> 05:31.279
WELL, YOU KNOW... NOBODY
LIKES YOU AT WORK,

05:31.347 --> 05:33.281
AND YOU DON'T CARE.
IT'S... YOU KNOW.

05:33.349 --> 05:36.367
WHAT? EVERYBODY
AT WORK LIKES ME.

05:36.435 --> 05:37.635
HOW-HOW 'BOUT MICHELLE?

05:44.643 --> 05:46.594
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVERYBODY AT WORK LIKES ME,

05:46.662 --> 05:48.362
AND YOU JUST
LOST YOUR ASH.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.734

06:10.535 --> 06:11.285
HI, GUYS.

06:29.604 --> 06:30.738
IT'S HYSTERICAL,
RIGHT?

06:30.806 --> 06:32.073
YES. ESPECIALLY WHEN
THEY STOLE THE CAR-

06:32.141 --> 06:33.574
HA HA!
THAT WAS SO FUNNY!

06:33.642 --> 06:34.758
WHAT'S UP?
HA HA!

06:34.826 --> 06:36.610
OH, I... I BETTER

06:42.935 --> 06:44.585
HI, CARRIE.
OH, LISA, THANK GOD.

06:44.653 --> 06:45.753
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

06:45.820 --> 06:46.604
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

06:46.755 --> 06:48.323
UM...
AROUND THE OFFICE.

06:48.390 --> 06:50.491
AM I, UH...
AM I LIKED?

06:50.559 --> 06:51.926
I LIKE YOU A LOT!

06:51.993 --> 06:54.695
I KNOW. I KNOW YOU DO. BUT,
UM... WHAT ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE?

06:54.763 --> 06:57.515
OH. NO, THEY DON'T.

07:00.119 --> 07:01.886
DOUG WAS RIGHT!

07:01.954 --> 07:04.688
WELL, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. I
- I MEAN, YOU'RE ALWAYS SO BUSY WORKING,

07:04.756 --> 07:07.825
YOU PROBABLY DON'T
HAVE TIME TO BE... NICE.

07:07.892 --> 07:10.728
YOU KNOW WHAT? IF THAT'S
ALL PEOPLE CARE ABOUT

07:10.763 --> 07:12.647
AROUND HERE,
I CAN PLAY

07:12.715 --> 07:13.981
THE NICE GAME. THERE
ARE A MILLION THINGS

07:14.049 --> 07:16.284
<i>I COULD DO TO SHOW
EVERYBODY HOW NICE I AM.</i>

07:16.352 --> 07:17.985
HUH!

07:18.053 --> 07:19.520
WELL, WHAT CAN I DO?

07:21.156 --> 07:22.173
UM... W... WELL,

07:22.240 --> 07:24.342
YOU COULD HELP ME FILE
THESE CREDIT REPORTS.

07:24.409 --> 07:26.160
OH, COME ON. GET SERIOUS.
THAT'S NOT GONNA DO IT.

07:26.228 --> 07:29.113
I NEED SOMETHIN'... SOMETHIN'
FLASHY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

07:29.181 --> 07:31.515
SOMETHIN' TO GET PEOPLE
TALKIN' AROUND HERE.

07:32.918 --> 07:34.953
WHAT-WHAT'S THAT ONE'S NAME OVER THERE?

07:36.305 --> 07:37.054
THE ONE
WITH THE FRIZZY HAIR

07:37.122 --> 07:38.840
AND THE EARTH SHOES?

07:38.907 --> 07:39.841
DAWN.

07:39.908 --> 07:41.209
DAWN. THAT'S RIGHT.

07:41.276 --> 07:44.445
I'M GONNA RIDE HER FRUMPY ASS
ALL THE WAY TO NICEVILLE.

07:51.937 --> 07:53.137
HEY.

07:53.205 --> 07:54.572
I THINK I FIGURED OUT

07:54.639 --> 07:56.324
WHY THE NEW GUY DIDN'T
INVITE ME TO HIS BARBECUE.

07:56.391 --> 07:58.142
GREAT. NOW
I CAN SLEEP.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.044
REMEMBER LAST WEEK
AT LUNCH WHEN I SAID

08:00.112 --> 08:02.446
ANYBODY WHO LIKES
SOURDOUGH BREAD IS A DOUCHE?

08:04.233 --> 08:05.399
NO.

08:05.467 --> 08:06.434
OK, WHAT'S THE POINT

08:06.501 --> 08:08.303
OF DOUG'S FOOD ROUNDUP
IF NO ONE LISTENS?

08:08.370 --> 08:10.554
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT ABOUT IT?

08:10.622 --> 08:13.041
WHEN I SAID THAT, HE GAVE
ME, LIKE, A LOOK. YOU KNOW?

08:13.108 --> 08:14.475
<i>MAYBE HE LIKES
SOURDOUGH BREAD.</i>

08:14.543 --> 08:15.743
MAYBE I OFFENDED
THE GUY.

08:15.811 --> 08:16.828
UH-HUH...

08:18.580 --> 08:19.797
WHAT?

08:19.865 --> 08:22.016
HELLO! GO ASK HIM
IF HE LIKES SOURDOUGH BREAD.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.067
WHAT?! I'M NOT
GONNA DO THAT!

08:23.134 --> 08:24.234
COME ON! YOU OWE ME!

08:24.302 --> 08:25.369
FOR WHAT?

08:25.437 --> 08:27.654
ALL RIGHT, I'LL OWE YOU.
JUST DO IT.

08:27.722 --> 08:28.706
OH, JEEZ.

08:31.359 --> 08:33.059
HEY, UM...

08:46.792 --> 08:48.993
HE'S NEVER HAD
SOURDOUGH.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.411
DAMMIT!

08:51.579 --> 08:53.647
WELL, IT'S
GOTTA BE SOMETHING.

08:53.715 --> 08:56.083
HEY, WAIT A SECOND. DOES
HE KNOW I LIVE LOCALLY?

08:57.869 --> 09:01.072
DOES HE KNOW
I LIVE LOCALLY?

09:01.140 --> 09:04.308
NO. HE THINKS YOU FLY IN FROM YOUR RANCH

09:04.375 --> 09:06.777
TO DELIVER PACKAGES.

09:07.596 --> 09:09.080
I GOTTA
FIGURE THIS OUT.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.581
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST GO OVER THERE

09:10.649 --> 09:13.384
AND ASK HIM
IF HE LIKES ME.

09:13.452 --> 09:14.886
JUST DO IT, MAN!

09:17.589 --> 09:19.273
I'M TOO OLD
FOR THIS CRAP.

09:21.610 --> 09:23.761
TAKE ME OR LEAVE ME?

09:23.829 --> 09:25.680
TAKE ME OR LEAVE ME?!

09:27.015 --> 09:29.016
CAN YOU BELIEVE
HE SAID THAT?!

09:29.084 --> 09:31.168
DOUG, THESE PIZZA ROLLS
ARE INCREDIBLE.

09:31.236 --> 09:33.270
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

09:33.338 --> 09:36.274
SOAK 'EM IN BACON GREASE.
WHERE DOES A ROOKIE DRIVER

09:36.341 --> 09:38.292
GET OFF SAYING HE CAN
TAKE ME OR LEAVE ME?

09:38.360 --> 09:39.844
<i>IF ANYTHING, I SHOULD
BE TAKIN' OR LEAVIN' HIM!</i>

09:39.912 --> 09:42.046
ALL RIGHT, C
- CAN WE PLEASE WATCH THE GAME?

09:42.114 --> 09:43.631
HEY. IF YOU CARE THAT MUCH...

09:43.698 --> 09:46.600
I COULD BRING YOU TO THE
BARBECUE AS MY PLUS ONE.

09:49.538 --> 09:51.722
YEAH. I'M INVITED.

09:53.258 --> 09:56.393
AND HE'S EVEN BOARDIN' HIS
CAT BECAUSE OF MY ALLERGIES.

09:57.629 --> 09:59.797
THIS-THIS IS A NIGHTMARE. YOU KNOW,

09:59.865 --> 10:01.582
MY KID GOT 18 STITCHES LAST MONTH.

10:01.649 --> 10:03.150
DIDN'T WHINE AS MUCH
AS YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:03.218 --> 10:04.985
I'M DONE. I DON'T CARE.

10:05.053 --> 10:07.087
HE DOESN'T WANT TO INVITE
ME, THAT'S HIS PROBLEM.

10:07.155 --> 10:09.239
OK? ANYWAY, CARRIE AND I
ARE GONNA KICK IT

10:09.307 --> 10:11.142
AT THE TILE STORE
ON SATURDAY, SO...

10:13.045 --> 10:15.913
I DON'T NEED TO GO TO HIS LITTLE PARTY
ANYWAY. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TIME.

10:15.981 --> 10:18.483
<i>WELL, GOOD FOR YOU. IT IS
GOOD FOR ME. BAD FOR HIM. OK?</i>

10:18.550 --> 10:21.318
HE'S NOT GONNA HAVE THIS FLOATIN'
IN HIS POOL. GAME OVER. I WIN.

10:27.292 --> 10:29.160
HEY, ME AND DAWN
ARE BACK FROM LUNCH.

10:29.228 --> 10:31.128
WHAT'D WE MISS?
