(HARVEY READING)

00:02.211 --> 00:03.963
You walked out of our session
because you didn't want

00:04.086 --> 00:05.555
to talk about your mother.
You're insane.

00:05.631 --> 00:08.009
And you're a self-serving
narcissist who will do or say

00:08.090 --> 00:09.388
anything to get
what he wants.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.559
It's my sister's company.
I'll give you her business.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.265
All you have to do is
handle her divorce.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.349
All right, I'll do it.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.809
Promise me you won't
sleep with Esther.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.562
The last thing I want to do
is sleep with your sister.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.947
Would you like to take
me home tonight?

00:22.356 --> 00:23.357
I would.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.655
Jack Soloff signed
Fletcher as a client.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.031
And now I have to let
McKernon go.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.703
I'm sorry you're in
this position right now.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.406
I'm not the one who
put you in it.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.957
Jack Soloff is.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.494
This is your last
chance to work with me.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.544
Take it, and you
have a future.

00:36.620 --> 00:40.045
Don't, and you can go ask
Daniel Hardman for a job.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.796
I'm ready to talk
about my mother.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.360
Mom?

01:08.902 --> 01:09.903
Mom?

01:10.445 --> 01:11.492
Harvey.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.124
What are you...
What are you doing here?

01:14.199 --> 01:16.622
I got sent home from
school. I threw up.

01:17.369 --> 01:18.416
Well, let's get you to...

01:18.495 --> 01:19.838
Hey, Lil, I was
thinking that...

01:21.373 --> 01:23.751
Who's that? Honey, uh,
you remember our cousin.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.256
My cousin, Scott?

01:26.128 --> 01:27.380
Hey.
No.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.761
Of course you do.
He's Cousin Judy's brother.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.966
I don't feel good.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.306
Oh, yeah.
You're burning up.

01:33.885 --> 01:34.932
Let's get you to bed.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.773
And let's not tell Dad
about Cousin Scott. Okay?

01:38.849 --> 01:39.850
'Cause they
don't get along.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.271
Come on.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.486
You poor thing.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.526
"You poor thing."

01:50.444 --> 01:51.445
That's what stuck with me.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.617
She said, "You poor thing."

01:53.697 --> 01:55.199
But she didn't give
a shit about me.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.742
And did you know
what you saw?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.709
No, I just knew
something was wrong.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.464
And you didn't
tell your father.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.208
She told me not to.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.127
And you trusted her.

02:07.878 --> 02:08.878
I did.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.554
Harvey, I never thought I'd be
saying this to you, but I'm proud.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.594
It took an amazing amount of
courage to tell me that.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.972
We're not gonna hug, are we?
No, we're not.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.557
But it does feel good
to end a session

02:19.640 --> 02:20.641
on a positive
note for once.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.362
The Peterson case, huh?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.402
I remember when I used to
handle that asshole.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.492
That's funny. I don't remember
inviting you into my office.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.114
Oh yeah, that's right.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.200
It must be because it's something
that I would never do.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.412
Listen, Mike, I know I pulled
some shit with you and Louis,

02:41.536 --> 02:43.755
but I'm here to make things right with you.
Not interested.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.667
Just hear me out.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.213
What the hell is this?

02:51.588 --> 02:54.341
A case that's tailor-made for someone
with a hedge fund background.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.099
New York teacher's
pension fund just lost

02:58.178 --> 02:59.771
30% of their
annual income.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.899
They put half their portfolio
in derivatives without hedging?

03:02.974 --> 03:04.851
Not just derivatives.
Derivatives created and

03:04.935 --> 03:07.779
marketed by Straussbank to
increase their own revenue.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.572
Sorry, Jack, I don't work with
people that I don't trust.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.073
And I don't trust somebody
who comes to me saying

03:14.152 --> 03:15.870
they're trying to make things
right without a good reason.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.741
You want the reason?
Jessica told me to.

03:18.824 --> 03:19.825
Yeah, well, she
didn't tell me.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.794
And until she does, you
can get out of my office.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.464
The Simon brief is
on your desk,

03:33.547 --> 03:35.470
and I moved your Wednesday
noon meeting to 5:00.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.013
Why did you do that?

03:37.092 --> 03:39.390
Because Anthony Kimball's more
honest with a drink in him.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.847
And on top of that, I wouldn't
want you to have to work

03:41.930 --> 03:43.147
too hard on your birthday.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.733
What? It's not my birthday.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.477
Oh, come on.
You can tell me.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.403
What is it, 48? 49?

03:48.478 --> 03:49.604
The big 6-0?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.736
A, I'm not the
one pushing 60.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.283
You better not be
talking to me.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.237
B, if it were, I'd be
drinking with someone a lot

03:56.319 --> 03:57.491
prettier than Anthony Kimball.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.661
Then why is Wednesday
night permanently

03:59.740 --> 04:01.037
blocked out on
your calendar?

04:08.749 --> 04:10.217
Donna.
Harvey.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.467
You look busy.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.840
I look busy because I am busy.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.130
(DONNA SIGHS)

04:17.132 --> 04:19.476
Too busy to join me at
Del Posto on Wednesday night?

04:21.636 --> 04:23.263
Harvey, we don't need
to do that anymore.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.392
Then why did you leave it permanently
blocked off on my calendar?

04:26.475 --> 04:27.977
Because I did that
a long time ago,

04:28.059 --> 04:30.278
and when I left your
desk, I forgot to undo it.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.031
Then why don't we pretend that you
forgot to undo it on purpose?

04:33.982 --> 04:36.326
I don't work for you anymore.
What would we be celebrating?

04:36.401 --> 04:39.245
Instead of celebrating the
day you came to my desk,

04:39.321 --> 04:40.538
how about we celebrate

04:41.490 --> 04:42.912
two weeks of being
on decent terms?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.626
It's only been a
week and a half.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.244
Seriously, Donna.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.124
I don't just want to
be on decent terms.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.584
I want to get back
to being friends.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.009
That's really nice, Harvey.

04:55.504 --> 04:56.505
See you Wednesday night.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.011
Thanks.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.227
Jessica!

05:07.140 --> 05:08.642
What a pleasant surprise.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.068
I think we both know
that it isn't.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.730
Pleasant, or a surprise? Either.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.656
Because we also both
know that Jack Soloff

05:14.731 --> 05:15.823
came to see you
before I did.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.696
Is there a problem with that?
There is,

05:17.776 --> 05:19.574
if you’re colluding
with one of my partners

05:19.694 --> 05:20.741
to take over my firm.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.865
Jack came to me

05:22.948 --> 05:25.042
asking for advice about
how to land a new client.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.660
He was so determined,

05:26.743 --> 05:29.622
I was suddenly reminded
of Harvey's first client.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.751
McKernon Motors.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.174
The client he cared
so much about,

05:32.249 --> 05:35.344
he gave up a promotion
just to keep his word.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.220
It's hard to forget
a move like that.

05:37.295 --> 05:40.048
It's also hard to
forget your history

05:40.131 --> 05:41.883
of worming your way
back into my firm.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.427
So, if you're looking for
someone to mentor, Daniel,

05:44.511 --> 05:46.605
go find yourself an
after-school program.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.148
But stay the hell
out of my house.

05:48.223 --> 05:52.103
Jessica, I have no interest
in your shitty firm.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.112
And I don't have to enter
your house to damage it.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.362
You did that all by yourself

05:57.440 --> 05:58.987
the second you let
Fletcher Engines go.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.034
Jack tell you that?

06:00.110 --> 06:01.783
Fletcher Engines
told everyone that.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.531
And you told
your entire firm

06:03.613 --> 06:06.162
that you care more about Harvey
Specter than you do about them.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.791
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
a meeting in my new office.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.836
It's so nice to be
back in the city.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.672
<i>See the money, wanna stay
for your meal</i>

06:19.754 --> 06:23.224
<i>Get another piece of pie
for your wife</i>

06:23.300 --> 06:26.554
<i>Everybody wanna
know how it feel</i>

06:26.636 --> 06:29.890
<i>Everybody wanna see
what it's like</i>

06:29.973 --> 06:32.647
<i>I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind</i>

06:33.393 --> 06:35.145
<i>Me and missy is so early</i>

06:35.228 --> 06:36.696
<i>Busy, busy making money</i>

06:37.105 --> 06:38.322
<i>All right!</i>

06:38.648 --> 06:42.619
<i>All step back
I'm 'bout to dance</i>

06:44.154 --> 06:45.952
<i>The greenback boogie</i>

06:51.161 --> 06:52.333
Clean out your things

06:52.454 --> 06:54.673
and get the hell out of my firm.
What?

06:54.998 --> 06:56.750
You know, I gave you one
last chance to play nice

06:56.833 --> 06:58.085
and you blew it.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.169
How did I blow it?

06:59.252 --> 07:00.925
Oh, you're going to
deny that you've been

07:01.004 --> 07:02.347
spreading word
around the office

07:02.422 --> 07:03.799
that I told you to drop
Fletcher Engines?

07:04.174 --> 07:06.427
Yes. I'm gonna deny it,
because I didn't do it.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.261
Then how the hell
does everybody know?

07:08.345 --> 07:11.098
Because I told them
when I signed Fletcher.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.225
Which I wouldn’t have
done if I'd known

07:13.308 --> 07:14.480
you were gonna
drop them.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.936
Because it made me
look like shit.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.530
Well, it didn't make me come out
smelling like a rose either.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.320
And your mentor seems
to have known that.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.866
He's not my mentor.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.285
I went to him for advice

07:23.360 --> 07:25.488
and all it got me was
almost getting fired.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.493
But you said you'd give
me one more chance.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.040
And I've been trying
to take it.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.367
Give me one good
example of that.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.703
I approached Mike Ross to
work with me this morning.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.504
And by the way,
he spat in my face.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.003
(SIGHS)

07:38.291 --> 07:39.543
Jessica,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.880
you made your point
and I heard you.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.219
If you're just gonna
fire me anyway

07:45.298 --> 07:47.050
why give me the chance
in the first place?

07:49.719 --> 07:50.720
A joke?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.021
Uh, do you
hear me laughing?

07:52.514 --> 07:54.733
10% is 11%
more than you deserve.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.731
I'll... What the hell?

07:58.061 --> 07:59.062
This better be important.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.146
I was just about
to close a deal.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.982
I just heard a rumor
that Jack Soloff

08:02.065 --> 08:03.191
signed Fletcher Engines.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.948
That's ridiculous. Everyone
knows we can't sign Fletcher

08:06.027 --> 08:06.994
if we represent McKernon.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.617
I'll tell you what
everyone knows, Louis.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.115
Jack signed Fletcher.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.242
Jessica forced him
to drop them.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.119
And the only reason Jack
would have done that

08:14.202 --> 08:16.625
in the first place is if you
were fired by McKernon.

08:17.914 --> 08:18.915
Harvey, I can explain.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.171
Goddamn it, I knew it.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.594
Just wait a minute.
Harvey, listen to me.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.303
Jack set us up.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.097
He acted as if he
was cooperating

08:26.172 --> 08:27.890
when all along he was
looking to blow up the deal.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.309
Why the hell didn't you come
to me when it happened?

08:29.384 --> 08:30.476
Because we wanted to
fix it ourselves.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.679
Wanting to fix it yourself
is the cause of every problem

08:32.761 --> 08:33.763
you and I have ever had.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.063
And now you're teaching
that bullshit to Mike?

08:35.472 --> 08:36.941
You know what? Mike and
I worked on that deal

08:37.017 --> 08:38.269
together and we kicked ass.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.107
I'm happy, Mike's happy,
Dominic's happy.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.438
And I'll tell you why.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.615
Because I'm a damn good
attorney and you know it.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.363
So, if that's the only
thing you came in here for,

08:46.443 --> 08:47.535
I would like to
close my deal now.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.167
Mr. Specter,
Esther Litt just called.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.374
She has an urgent matter,
needs to see you right away.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.588
Did she say what
it was about?

09:02.667 --> 09:04.340
Just not to
tell her brother.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.562
Oh, so this is where the little
people get their caffeine.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.606
I'm guessing you're not here
to have a breakfast bar.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.688
I've never had a
breakfast bar in my life.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.604
I wanna thank you for
taking on that pension case

09:21.686 --> 09:22.687
with Jack Soloff.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.069
I didn't take on the pension
case with Jack Soloff.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.192
Yes, you did.
Jessica, no.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.572
You can't make me
work with that man.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.780
Oh, I can make you work with the
goddamn window washers if I want to.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.664
And if you don't do this,

09:33.740 --> 09:36.289
you might find yourself dangling
50 stories above the ground.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.755
Because I asked Jack to make peace.
Why?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.173
And you're the one he
chose to reach out to.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.750
So you're the one to do this.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.255
I guess I meant, why
don't you just fire him?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.963
If I fired every
ambitious attorney

09:48.046 --> 09:49.263
that ever took me on,

09:49.339 --> 09:51.512
there'd be nobody left here
but me and Harold Gunderson.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.852
Wait a second. You know who
Harold Gunderson is?

09:55.178 --> 09:56.350
I know who everybody is.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.181
And before you say
one more word,

09:58.264 --> 10:01.768
if I ever start handing out
pink slips for troublemakers...

10:01.851 --> 10:03.103
You'd be the first in line.

10:03.686 --> 10:04.687
Right.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.284
I came here as soon as
I got your message.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.032
I don't do that
for most people.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.078
So much for hard to get.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.243
I think we're past that.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.411
Did Jeffrey get
greedy again?

10:16.533 --> 10:18.535
No. A man named
Kenneth Jackson

10:18.618 --> 10:20.120
is claiming my
nut-free muffins

10:20.203 --> 10:21.625
put him in
anaphylactic shock.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.881
What happened?
Too much gluten?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.041
Not enough gluten?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.798
Harvey, this isn't funny.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.628
This is my company, and

10:28.711 --> 10:30.839
my entire brand is
based on quality.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.427
I'm sorry.
I'll take it seriously.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.722
Thank you.
Don't thank me.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.805
Thank Louis, because he's
gonna handle this case.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.940
What?
This is a business matter,

10:41.015 --> 10:43.143
not personal. And I'm not
stealing Louis' client.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.398
You're not stealing me.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.945
You already handled
my divorce.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.199
Are you gonna tell me that Louis
is a better lawyer than you?

10:49.274 --> 10:51.652
No, I'm gonna tell you that
he's a damn good lawyer,

10:51.734 --> 10:53.111
and he'd do anything
to protect you.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.320
That's not the point.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.372
I need this to
go away quietly.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.916
And Louis doesn't do
anything quietly.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.165
Then tell him that.
He never listens to me.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.087
Then get him to listen or
get another law firm.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.460
Because I'm not
taking this case.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.878
Harvey, I don't need
another firm.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.633
I need you.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.680
You know what I think?

11:12.755 --> 11:14.473
I think you wanna go
out with me again

11:14.549 --> 11:15.675
and you came to
me with this

11:15.758 --> 11:17.055
because you were
afraid to say it to me.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.182
I don't believe you!

11:18.261 --> 11:21.686
You think I concocted a lawsuit
against my own company

11:21.764 --> 11:24.438
just to tell a man I've already
been with that I like him?

11:25.226 --> 11:26.273
Sure looks that way.

11:26.769 --> 11:30.364
In that case, I guess I do have
the wrong man for the job.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.242
Thank you for taking the time.

11:50.585 --> 11:51.962
Please let him
know I'm here.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.801
Esther.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.387
What are you doing here?

11:56.466 --> 11:58.264
I thought I was very
clear yesterday.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.478
I'm not taking your case.
You were clear.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.559
I'm here to see Louis.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.268
But it's nice to see your
ego is as strong as ever.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.232
I'm sorry.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.279
And I didn't mean to be
such a dick yesterday.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.402
It's okay, Harvey.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.482
I know what you did.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.901
You accused me of what
you accused me of

12:14.984 --> 12:16.110
so I would go to Louis.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.320
So, you're not
mad at me?

12:18.196 --> 12:20.073
It was actually sweet,

12:20.156 --> 12:22.158
in a dick-ish
sort of way.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.077
That's my specialty.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.337
Thanks, Harvey.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.507
Hi, Esther, I'm
Donna Paulsen.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.176
I'm Louis'...
I know who you are.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.511
You're the best thing that's
ever happened to my brother.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.806
Oh. Well, you don't
know the half of it.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.061
Anyway, I hope I didn't put you to
too much trouble on short notice.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.179
Oh, nonsense.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.061
Louis was thrilled when he
heard you were coming in.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.437
What was so goddamn important that
I had to cancel my entire morning?

12:47.517 --> 12:49.019
I swear, he was
happy to do it.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.899
And you and I are
having lunch the second

12:50.979 --> 12:52.572
whatever it is you're
here for is over.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.362
You want a sip?
ls that a prunie?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.782
No. I can't believe you
still drink that crap.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.658
You know I've got Grandma
Gertie's spastic colon.

12:59.737 --> 13:00.784
What the hell are
you doing here?

13:01.864 --> 13:02.956
I'm being sued.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.785
(CHUCKLES) Holy shit.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.619
Your shitty muffins really
did give someone salmonella.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.920
It's not salmonella.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.919
And Louis, this is serious.
It's my company.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.040
All right, I'm sorry.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.210
Well, does he have a leg to stand on?
Of course not.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.555
I do an audit of every supplier
every three months. Are you sure?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.758
Because if we're gonna go after
him with everything we've got...

13:19.841 --> 13:21.559
Louis, we're not going
after him at all.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.682
I want to settle this
quickly and quietly.

13:23.761 --> 13:24.978
Esther.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.437
You settle,
you look guilty.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.518
This is a shakedown,
pure and simple.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.319
I know that,
but I don't care.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.738
This is a
business decision.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.986
And that's why I'm trying to stop
others from doing the same thing.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.191
I'm telling you, I
know what I'm doing.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.577
I didn't say you don't. No, you're
just telling me how to do my job.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.371
Louis, I came to you
because you're my brother.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.075
And I am telling you,
this is what I need.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.243
All right, we'll settle.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.455
Thank you, Louis.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.085
No, thank you.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.172
For what? For not
going to Harvey.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.141
Once he handled your divorce,

14:01.215 --> 14:03.138
I would have thought you'd
want him to handle everything.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.102
Harvey. Make
yourself comfortable.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.399
Can I get you a mimosa?
No, thanks.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.443
I just stopped by to
eat my morning bagel

14:16.522 --> 14:17.865
and ask why Jack Soloff

14:17.940 --> 14:20.363
tried to sign Fletcher Engines
and you didn't tell me.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.283
I didn't tell you because
I was busy fixing it.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.368
And did fixing it
involve figuring out

14:24.447 --> 14:25.664
that he went to
Daniel Hardman?

14:25.823 --> 14:26.824
As a matter of fact,
it did.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.495
You saw Hard man.

14:31.162 --> 14:33.005
I did. And it
didn't take long

14:33.081 --> 14:34.298
because he's back
in New York.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.378
Let me guess, he said he had
nothing to do with any of this.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.966
Yep. He said he was just giving
Jack some helpful advice.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.890
Well, I think it's time we gave Jack
some helpful advice of our own,

14:42.965 --> 14:44.512
like, "Get your ass
another job."

14:45.301 --> 14:47.144
Now, Harvey, I met with Jack.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.643
He says he's done
confiding in Hardman.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.229
And I've decided to
consider the matter closed.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.935
You're telling me you
trust that clown?

14:54.185 --> 14:56.153
Now, I may look damn
good for my age,

14:56.229 --> 14:57.651
but I wasn't
born yesterday.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.824
You want to know how deep it goes
with him and Hardman, don't you?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.117
I sure <i>as</i> hell do.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.825
Which is why I asked Mike to
work with Jack and play nice,

15:04.904 --> 15:06.247
and you better not
get in the way.

15:10.993 --> 15:11.994
This doesn't look like a

15:12.120 --> 15:14.339
"Forgive Me For Being A Dick" card.
It's not.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.917
It's a 28-page interrogatory
for Straussbank.

15:17.875 --> 15:18.876
Thanks.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.094
What are you doing?

15:20.169 --> 15:22.513
You told me you don't work
with people you don't trust.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.392
Neither do I. You don't have
to trust me to understand

15:26.467 --> 15:28.970
that the shady shit at
Straussbank starts at the top.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.101
All the way to the top?

15:31.180 --> 15:33.433
There's a 50-50 chance
that the CEO knows.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.688
The CFO
had to know.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.312
All we have to do is get their emails.
That's easy.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.230
We agree not to pursue
criminal charges,

15:39.313 --> 15:40.781
they'll hand emails
over right now.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.279
We can't give up the
threat of going to prison.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.201
That's what gives us leverage.
We have to go to court.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.449
Going to court
will take forever.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.530
I just went through this same
thing with Robert Zane. Okay?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.082
Why don't you pick up the phone and
ask him who turned out to be right?

15:51.242 --> 15:53.085
You know, I heard
you were cocky.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.583
But I had no idea.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.539
You're the one who came to
me looking to make peace.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.583
You wanna make
peace or not?

16:04.881 --> 16:07.134
All right, we'll
try it your way.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.263
Rachel, what can
I do for you?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.523
I heard about Esther.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.646
And I was hoping
I could help.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.019
I appreciate the
offer, but I'm gonna

16:18.102 --> 16:19.194
take care of this
one myself.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.817
And I'm not trying
to interfere,

16:20.897 --> 16:22.740
I just thought it would be
nice to learn from the most

16:22.857 --> 16:25.736
talented, diligent, and respected
partner that we have here.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.530
Yeah, you're just trying to butter me up.
ls it working?

16:29.363 --> 16:30.364
Handsome.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.033
Listen to me.

16:33.576 --> 16:36.125
She's my sister.
She's being sued.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.794
Last time she had a
problem, she went to Harvey.

16:38.873 --> 16:39.840
But this time,
she's coming to me.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.088
And I'm not gonna
farm any of it out.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.214
Can you understand that?

16:42.376 --> 16:44.845
The reason I want on this case is
that I admire Esther and her company.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.344
And if someone's coming at her
with a frivolous lawsuit, then

16:48.049 --> 16:49.426
I don't care
how little I do.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.182
I just wanna help you.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.643
Paperwork's right here.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.815
JACK: Your Honor,
<i>as</i> you can see,

17:03.898 --> 17:05.275
there's been clear
negligence at best,

17:05.358 --> 17:06.530
deliberate deception
at worst...

17:06.608 --> 17:08.828
MIKE: Not to mention
a breach of fiduciary duty.

17:08.903 --> 17:10.200
I'm inclined to agree.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.281
Your Honor, the only thing
that's clear is his clients

17:12.365 --> 17:13.662
chose a risky investment.

17:13.741 --> 17:14.992
That's not deception
on our part.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.170
The deception is he
created those derivatives,

17:17.244 --> 17:18.291
he knew how
risky they were,

17:18.371 --> 17:19.417
and he sold them
to us anyway.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.545
I have $2 billion
in investment funds.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.046
You think I review
every investment?

17:23.125 --> 17:24.547
I don't know, but you sure
as hell reviewed this one.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.929
And where's your proof?
We don't have any. Yet.

17:27.003 --> 17:29.177
Which is why we're requesting
access to these emails.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.634
This isn't about getting
their emails.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.181
This is about determining
if trial's moving forward.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.433
And it is.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.348
I'll set the email discovery
hearing for three weeks.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.067
Three weeks? Uh, Your Honor, my
wife has surgery in three weeks.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.519
I'd like to request an
additional month.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.271
Bullshit, she has surgery.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.731
Scheduled C-section at
Columbia Presbyterian.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.192
Then put someone else
on the case.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.242
That's not how it works.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.035
If I may...
If we agree

17:50.111 --> 17:52.364
not to pursue criminal
charges in this matter,

17:52.446 --> 17:54.198
will you give us the
emails within the week?

17:55.324 --> 17:56.917
You agree to
that right here,

17:56.993 --> 17:58.085
I'll give 'em to
you tomorrow.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.541
Then we have a deal.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.511
You wanna tell me what kind
of kickback you're getting?

18:07.878 --> 18:08.879
Excuse me?

18:08.963 --> 18:10.135
You went behind
my back.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.340
I didn't do anything
behind your back.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.183
I did it in front of your face.
You know what I mean.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.853
You gave up our leverage by handing
him a get-out-of-jail-free card.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.771
Which means you're either in
their pocket or you're using

18:17.847 --> 18:19.520
this case so that you can
sign them once it's over.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.272
What did you just say to me?
You heard me.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.612
You shook that guy's hand like
you were his goddamn cousin.

18:24.687 --> 18:25.688
You listen to me.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.024
If they wanted to be my
client, I'd take them.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.905
But I didn't do that
to kiss his <i>ass,</i>

18:29.984 --> 18:31.201
I did it to get
what we needed.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.657
We already had
what we needed.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.286
No, we didn't. We had a
hearing on it in seven weeks.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.083
And that C-section bullshit was
just the tip of the iceberg.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.127
Between now and then,
they'd have figured out a way

18:40.202 --> 18:41.249
to put it off for
another two years.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.797
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.999
I said I would
try it your way

18:45.082 --> 18:46.334
and it didn't work.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.966
Well, now those
emails are coming.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.047
Are you gonna
help me or not?

18:58.220 --> 19:00.143
Louis, I need to talk you.
We have a problem.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.223
What's wrong?

19:01.349 --> 19:02.942
What's wrong is
Kenneth Jackson's lawyer.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.189
Her name is
Lisbeth Wexler,

19:04.268 --> 19:05.520
and this isn't her
first frivolous suit.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.729
Well, it never is
with these people.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.813
That doesn't mean
we can't settle.

19:07.897 --> 19:08.864
Okay, you
don't understand.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.316
I went through
dozens of her cases.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.525
Every time she
gets an offer,

19:11.609 --> 19:13.031
she threatens to
go public with it.

19:13.736 --> 19:14.737
Shit.
What?

19:15.488 --> 19:16.614
That's exactly what
I was afraid of.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.833
Okay, well, then you know it's not
a big deal. We can handle it.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.251
But we can't give
them an offer.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.249
No, you don't understand.
I tried to tell Esther this

19:22.328 --> 19:24.001
might happen, but then she
made me promise that I would

19:24.080 --> 19:25.582
make this thing go away
without any trouble.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.713
Okay. Well, if we don't do
something other than settle,

19:27.792 --> 19:29.214
she's in for a hell
of a lot more trouble.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.385
HARVEY: He didn't
really say that.

19:37.468 --> 19:38.640
Oh, not only did he say it,

19:38.719 --> 19:41.643
but I had to transcribe
it word for word

19:41.722 --> 19:42.894
off his
Dictaphone.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.145
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

19:46.936 --> 19:47.903
What?

19:47.978 --> 19:49.480
I just realized I
haven't thought about

19:49.605 --> 19:51.778
Jack Soloff and his
bullshit for two hours.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.860
I'm glad we
did this, Harvey.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.445
Me too. We should
do it more often.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.782
Well, I'm not sure how Mitchell
would feel about that.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.203
Who's Mitchell?

20:00.282 --> 20:02.330
He's the man that I've been
seeing for the last six weeks.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.163
He's...

20:05.246 --> 20:08.466
He's smart and
he's funny. And

20:08.541 --> 20:10.964
best of all, he has nothing to
do with the practice of law.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.219
I'm happy for you, Donna.

20:13.796 --> 20:14.843
Thanks.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.767
And the reason
I told you is

20:18.843 --> 20:21.687
so that you'll know that
I'm not jealous when I say

20:24.140 --> 20:26.017
you need to tell Louis you've
been sleeping with Esther.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.481
What?
Oh, please.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.734
It took me all of two seconds
to put it together after I saw

20:30.813 --> 20:32.781
you two mooning over
each other this morning.

20:32.857 --> 20:33.904
It's not what
you think.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.156
We bonded together during
her divorce proceedings.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.363
Harvey, you said you
wanted to be friends.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.698
This is me being your friend.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.995
Friends don't accuse
each other of things.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.915
I'm not accusing you,
I'm looking out for you.

20:44.994 --> 20:45.995
How is that looking
out for me?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.421
Because like I said,
you need to tell him.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.715
Well, you know what?
I don't need to do that.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.963
Because for once,
your radar is off.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.510
We haven't been
sleeping together.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.633
We slept together one time.

20:54.712 --> 20:55.713
What difference
does that make?

20:55.796 --> 20:57.264
You promised him
you wouldn't do it at all.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.639
Donna, Louis isn't
rational on his best days

21:00.718 --> 21:02.470
with <i>issues that
don't involve his sister.</i>

21:02.553 --> 21:04.726
Now, how is he gonna take it
if I do what you're asking?

21:04.805 --> 21:06.523
And how do you think he's
gonna react when he finds out

21:06.599 --> 21:08.272
you kept this from him?
He's not gonna find out.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.351
Yes, he is.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.943
Because I didn't have to be me to see
the way you two looked at each other.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.945
And someday, Louis is
gonna see that, too.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.950
Donna, I appreciate you
telling me this, <i>as</i> a friend.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.657
Now, as a friend,
I'm telling you

21:22.740 --> 21:24.287
to mind your own business.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.426
I was right.

21:34.543 --> 21:35.590
You cut them
some side deal.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.508
What the hell are
you talking about?

21:37.588 --> 21:39.636
I went through all their
emails and I found nothing

21:39.715 --> 21:40.887
tying them to anything.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.636
Which means you knew they
would leave some emails out

21:43.719 --> 21:45.187
and you let it go to get
something out of it.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.976
I didn't know they would
leave anything out,

21:47.056 --> 21:48.182
but I thought
they might.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.688
And I am gonna get something out of
it, but it's not what you think.

21:50.768 --> 21:51.860
What are you talking about?

21:51.936 --> 21:54.405
Your idea of threatening
prison was right.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.609
But nobody ever went to jail
for selling shitty securities.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.570
They go to jail for
destroying evidence.

22:00.903 --> 22:04.157
So, instead of proving to some
jury that doesn't understand

22:04.240 --> 22:08.165
securities law that these guys knew
the risks of their investments...

22:08.244 --> 22:10.372
All we have to do is prove
they deleted some emails.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.626
I'm sorry.

22:17.753 --> 22:18.754
Take a seat.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.801
You know, that's the
second time in two days

22:23.884 --> 22:25.682
that you jumped right to
me being the bad guy.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.684
Well, you have to admit,
my experience with how you

22:27.763 --> 22:29.936
treated me and Louis was
you being the bad guy.

22:30.933 --> 22:31.934
Fair enough.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.687
But were you there when
Louis lied to my face

22:34.770 --> 22:35.942
about backing
me in a meeting?

22:36.689 --> 22:39.533
When he told Jessica that
I did something awful

22:39.608 --> 22:41.155
that he, in fact, did?

22:41.485 --> 22:42.737
No, I wasn't.

22:43.112 --> 22:45.661
But you do know him,
and what he's capable of.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.409
And you're somehow on
good terms with him.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.120
I'm on good terms with him because
I've seen other sides of him.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.830
(LAUGHS) Well, I have
other sides, too.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.257
I may have done some
office backstabbing,

22:56.542 --> 22:58.715
but I have never
done anything to indicate

22:58.794 --> 23:00.296
to you that I would
do something illegal.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.802
Which is what you came
in here accusing me of.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.467
Okay, Jack.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.597
You can have a chance to show me
another side of yourself, too.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.397
I told you to
settle this thing.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.572
And I'm trying to.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.571
Then why did I just get a
notice that the FDA

23:21.650 --> 23:23.027
is investigating my company?

23:23.110 --> 23:24.111
What?

23:24.320 --> 23:25.367
What did you do?

23:29.158 --> 23:31.081
I was gonna settle, but
then Rachel found out

23:31.160 --> 23:32.912
their lawyer has a history
of blackmailing companies.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.747
So our only option
was to counter-sue.

23:34.830 --> 23:38.710
You filed a counter-suit against
my explicit instructions?

23:38.792 --> 23:40.669
You know what, Esther?
You came to me for help.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.303
I don't tell you
how to bake your muffins.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.473
Because you don't know the
first thing about my business.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.592
And you don't know the first thing
about mine. I don't have to.

23:46.675 --> 23:47.722
I know you.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.771
And you've got a chip on your
shoulder the size of Montana.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.190
And when it comes out, you
make everything worse.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.393
You know what, Esther?
I was right to do what I did!

23:55.768 --> 23:59.022
And for once, I'm not gonna let you
treat me like I'm less than you.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.693
(SCOFFS) Less than me?

24:00.773 --> 24:01.990
Yes, less than you.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.443
I'm always your
buffoon brother.

24:03.525 --> 24:04.651
Well, not this time.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.703
You had no right to do
this without asking me.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.281
I didn't ask you because
you wouldn't have listened.

24:08.364 --> 24:09.616
No, you never listen,

24:09.698 --> 24:11.996
which is why I wanted to go
to Harvey in the first place!

24:15.913 --> 24:17.256
What?
You heard me.

24:18.624 --> 24:19.967
How could you betray
me like that?

24:20.042 --> 24:21.760
I wasn't betraying you.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.505
I was looking out
for myself.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.848
If you were looking
out for yourself,

24:28.133 --> 24:29.635
then why did you lie
to me about going to him?

24:29.718 --> 24:31.061
Because you're always jealous

24:31.136 --> 24:33.355
whenever I ask anyone
else to do anything.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.271
You're my brother, Louis,
not my boyfriend.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.152
If you wanted Harvey so much, why
don't you go to him right now?

24:42.564 --> 24:43.565
I can't.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.072
Because when I
went to him,

24:47.653 --> 24:49.200
he told me I
should trust you.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.242
He really said that?
He didn't just say that.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.829
He said you were a
damn good lawyer.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.248
lam a damn good lawyer.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.258
But I should have told you.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.637
Well,

25:08.716 --> 25:09.763
what are we
gonna do now?

25:10.634 --> 25:11.635
Depends.

25:11.802 --> 25:13.395
If you think you
can trust me or not.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.140
I can.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.773
Morning, Louis.
Good morning.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.449
Where the hell were you? I
texted you, like, 18 times.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.698
Yes. And if it had
been an emergency,

25:28.819 --> 25:30.321
I would have called you back.
It was an emergency.

25:30.404 --> 25:32.577
Louis, running out of
paperclips is not an emergency.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.744
I know. lt'sjust
that I needed you

25:35.826 --> 25:38.295
and I couldn't reach you and
that's never happened before.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.714
I was having
dinner with Harvey.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.464
Harvey.
Yes.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.212
We're trying
to stay friends.

25:46.295 --> 25:47.968
Friends.
Yes, friends.

25:49.298 --> 25:50.720
I'm not going
back to him, Louis.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.260
What?
I know that.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.013
How'd it go?

25:56.680 --> 25:57.681
It was fine.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.062
He didn't happen to
bring up Esther, did he?

25:59.933 --> 26:01.310
What? Why would
he do that?

26:01.643 --> 26:04.487
Because apparently, she went
to him before she came to me.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.110
Well, he did
handle her divorce.

26:06.190 --> 26:07.191
I know. It's just...

26:09.151 --> 26:10.323
You don't think
it's possible that

26:10.402 --> 26:11.654
anything happened
between them, do you?

26:14.281 --> 26:15.658
I don't know,
Louis. I mean...

26:17.242 --> 26:19.620
Look, I do know that we talked
about a lot of things last night,

26:19.703 --> 26:20.875
and Esther
wasn't one of them.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.164
You're right.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.630
Harvey would never make a promise
like that to me and then break it.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.882
I'm glad you had a
nice dinner, though.

26:43.811 --> 26:44.812
What the hell is this?

26:45.104 --> 26:46.651
It's the stack of
emails they left out.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.358
How did you get them?

26:49.608 --> 26:52.452
It doesn't matter how I got them,
it matters that I got them.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.371
It does matter. Because if
you got them illegally,

26:54.488 --> 26:55.660
we can't use them
and you know it.

26:55.739 --> 26:56.991
I didn't get them illegally.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.122
Then why won't you tell me
where you got them?

26:59.201 --> 27:01.670
Because there are some things
I like to keep to myself.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.123
And didn't you give me a
speech about getting to know

27:04.206 --> 27:05.423
different sides of you?

27:05.499 --> 27:06.967
Well, this is a
different side of me.

27:07.584 --> 27:08.961
Are you gonna
trust it or not?

27:21.515 --> 27:24.314
Gentlemen. So glad you could
see us on such short notice.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.399
Well, you scratched
our backs,

27:26.478 --> 27:27.900
I think we can
scratch yours.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.941
What kind of settlement
are you looking for?

27:30.023 --> 27:31.366
We're not looking
for a settlement.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.284
We're looking for you
to give up your CEO.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.575
What? He's not giving anyone up.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.161
You waived your rights to
criminal charges in this matter.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.585
We're not talking about this matter, we're
talking about conspiracy to hide evidence.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.251
That's 200 emails
from your analysts

27:45.330 --> 27:47.424
laughing about the suckers
that you all ripped off.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.216
(SOFTLY) Shit.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.426
Relax, there's no way
he got those legally.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.848
You're right, we didn't. What?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.096
Goddamn it, you told me...

27:57.176 --> 27:58.223
I know what I told you, Jack.

27:58.302 --> 28:00.396
But you wouldn't have let me come
here if I told you the truth.

28:00.888 --> 28:01.889
And the truth

28:03.557 --> 28:05.685
is that we also
got this one illegally.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.103
That's your CEO

28:08.187 --> 28:11.111
saying that if push comes to shove,
he's gonna throw you under the bus.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.863
Now, do you really wanna
take the chance that we won't

28:12.941 --> 28:15.160
figure out a way to find
these others legally?

28:15.652 --> 28:17.029
You've got 200 people
in your firm.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.035
We're gonna offer every
single one of them immunity

28:19.114 --> 28:20.081
to admit they exist.

28:20.157 --> 28:23.252
And when they do, either
your CEO is going down...

28:23.327 --> 28:24.328
Or you are.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.929
LISBETH: Glad you came to your
senses and called us to settle.

28:35.005 --> 28:37.849
Well, clearly, Mr. Jackson has
suffered great physical harm.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.848
I just don't want anyone
else to be hurt.

28:39.927 --> 28:40.894
Yeah, that would be a shame.

28:40.969 --> 28:41.970
Then who would you
have to sue?

28:42.054 --> 28:43.397
Excuse me?
Sit down!

28:43.680 --> 28:45.557
Now, we're here because my
sister wanted to give you

28:45.641 --> 28:47.814
$50,000 to
make this thing go away.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.895
But I didn't listen to her, so
I'm gonna throw in an extra

28:49.978 --> 28:51.696
$50,000 of my own.

28:51.772 --> 28:53.900
It doesn't matter.
Because if you think that

28:53.982 --> 28:55.404
we're gonna settle
for $100,000,

28:55.484 --> 28:56.531
you're wasting our time.

28:56.610 --> 28:59.113
$100,000 isn't
to settle this.

28:59.196 --> 29:01.164
It's to have your client
admit that you approached him

29:01.240 --> 29:02.708
after he had a
public episode

29:02.783 --> 29:04.581
and then instructed him to
say that it was within

29:04.660 --> 29:06.412
five minutes of eating
one of our muffins.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.168
You have no proof of that.
LOUIS: No, we don't.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.920
But he's on record for
making a false statement

29:09.998 --> 29:10.999
to a federal agency,

29:11.083 --> 29:12.255
which means when we
do have proof,

29:12.334 --> 29:14.507
you're gonna be in prison
for a very, very long time.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.801
$100,000?
Kenneth,

29:16.880 --> 29:18.382
you'll get 20 times that
when we win.

29:18.674 --> 29:19.926
Maybe this will help
you decide, Kenneth.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.009
What's that?

29:21.093 --> 29:22.936
It's a list of all of the other
people you've done this with.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.059
What? Oh, did you think
you were her first?

29:25.389 --> 29:26.390
You were not.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.809
Whoever rolls over first
gets the money.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.815
Then the rest get to line
up for orange Jumpsuits.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.111
That's enough.
We're leaving.

29:33.397 --> 29:34.398
What do I have to do?

29:43.865 --> 29:44.866
Esther, what are
you doing here?

29:46.702 --> 29:48.124
I came to give you this.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.627
It's a $100,000 check.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.050
It's for Kenneth Jackson.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.585
We're splitting this.
No, we're not.

29:55.377 --> 29:57.050
You were right.
l never

29:57.129 --> 29:59.052
should have tried to settle
with them in the first place.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.095
You saved me
more than that.

30:02.884 --> 30:03.976
I don't know what to say.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.353
Say you'll forgive me?

30:10.100 --> 30:11.693
I don't think you're a
buffoon, Louis,

30:11.768 --> 30:13.395
and I never have.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.777
But I didn't realize

30:16.857 --> 30:18.530
how good a lawyer
you were

30:18.608 --> 30:19.985
until I saw
it myself.

30:21.903 --> 30:22.904
I appreciate that.

30:25.615 --> 30:28.459
But I know how hard you worked
to make your business happen.

30:28.535 --> 30:29.752
And I know what you gave up.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.501
And there wasn't a snowball's
chance in hell that I was

30:31.580 --> 30:32.752
gonna let someone take
advantage of you.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.003
Thanks, Louis.
Thank you.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.672
Hey...

30:43.300 --> 30:45.143
Do you want to
get dinner tonight?

30:46.178 --> 30:47.976
I can't tonight.
How about tomorrow night?

30:49.598 --> 30:50.599
Tomorrow night is perfect.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.519
What do you say we
also invite Donna?

30:54.603 --> 30:55.604
That would be
really nice.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.284
You come by just to tell me
how impressive I was today?

31:08.367 --> 31:10.495
I came by to ask you why
you still don't trust me.

31:10.911 --> 31:11.958
Who says I don't trust you?

31:12.037 --> 31:14.415
You didn't tell me that evidence
was obtained illegally.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.510
Jack, I told you
the truth.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.884
Those emails weren't
obtained illegally

31:20.962 --> 31:22.964
because they
weren't even real.

31:23.632 --> 31:24.633
What?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.138
Look. I know how traders talk.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.811
I know exactly
what they'd say. So,

31:28.970 --> 31:29.971
I just wrote them myself.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.140
Are you shitting me?

31:33.058 --> 31:34.059
Take a look.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.990
I lied to you because to get them
to believe they were illegal,

31:40.065 --> 31:41.817
I had to get them to
believe they were real.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.151
(CHUCKLES)

31:44.403 --> 31:46.656
And you needed me to be
pissed to help you do that.

31:46.947 --> 31:47.948
Told you to trust me.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.411
You know what?

31:54.079 --> 31:55.080
I do.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.208
So, I'll tell you the truth.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.260
When we started this thing, I was
just doing it to kiss your ass

32:00.335 --> 32:01.678
so Jessica would
forgive me.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.256
But...

32:04.339 --> 32:05.340
You're the real deal.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.677
I see what Harvey
sees in you.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.306
Thanks, Jack.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.854
Maybe now you can give Harvey
a second chance, too.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.866
It's just, everything
comes so easy to him.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.365
Jessica plucks him
from the mailroom,

32:26.445 --> 32:27.697
youngest senior
partner ever.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.785
Well, I've been busting my
ass for 20 years

32:32.868 --> 32:34.586
and nobody ever does
anything like that for me.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.922
Well, I'll tell you
something, Jack.

32:39.833 --> 32:42.086
He's got his own problems
just like everyone else.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.639
And if you wanna
get along with me...

32:46.923 --> 32:48.721
You better figure out
a way to get along with him.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.307
Gretchen, where are we at
with the Cabrillo claim?

32:55.390 --> 32:57.188
I have to go.
I'm not Gretchen

32:57.267 --> 33:00.237
and that's too bad for you, because she's
still in the habit of covering for you.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.564
Covering for me for what?

33:01.688 --> 33:03.531
I told you Louis was gonna
find out about Esther.

33:03.899 --> 33:04.991
And I told you it's
none of your business.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.160
Well, it became
my business

33:07.235 --> 33:09.237
when Louis asked me
about it yesterday.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.494
And I had to lie to his face just
to get him to leave it alone.

33:11.573 --> 33:12.870
I didn't ask you
to do that.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.326
Yes, you did,
and you know it.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.582
Donna, I don't have time for this.
I have an appointment...

33:16.661 --> 33:17.662
What appointment?

33:17.913 --> 33:21.213
I checked with Gretchen so you couldn't
get out of this with some made-up thing.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.381
Your calendar's empty.
You know what, Donna?

33:23.460 --> 33:25.838
One thing I learned
the hard way

33:25.921 --> 33:28.015
is not to tell your
secretary everything.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.720
Well, be careful, Harvey.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.096
Because you're about
to learn the hard way

33:31.218 --> 33:33.266
that I might have lied to
Louis about this once,

33:33.345 --> 33:35.768
but I am never, never
gonna do it again.

33:38.892 --> 33:39.893
Harvey?

33:40.769 --> 33:42.737
Harvey, where have you been
for the last 40 minutes?

33:42.812 --> 33:43.938
What are you talking about?

33:44.022 --> 33:46.775
I mean, you scheduled a session <i>so</i>
that we could explore your mother.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.868
And you've been telling me
some meaningless story about

33:48.944 --> 33:50.036
when you got stung by a bee.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.577
I got in a fight with Donna.

33:53.657 --> 33:54.658
A fight about what?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.627
She wants me to tell Louis
that I slept with his sister.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.962
And why exactly does she
want you to do that?

34:00.205 --> 34:02.299
Because I promised
Louis I wouldn't,

34:02.374 --> 34:03.967
and she thinks he's
gonna find out.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.211
Why would you make a
promise like that to Louis

34:06.294 --> 34:07.591
if you had no
intention of keeping it?

34:07.796 --> 34:09.469
I had every intention
of keeping it.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.639
It's Louis' sister.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.471
But then I met
her, and...

34:13.426 --> 34:14.393
It happened.

34:14.469 --> 34:15.891
Well, why don't
you just tell him that?

34:15.971 --> 34:17.268
Because he's like a
4-year-old.

34:17.347 --> 34:18.893
And on top of that,
he doesn't own her.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.065
She's his sister.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.940
But this isn't about his
relationship with his sister.

34:23.018 --> 34:24.817
It's about his
relationship with you.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.112
You made him a promise.

34:26.188 --> 34:27.735
Yeah. And as long as
he doesn't find out

34:27.815 --> 34:28.783
I broke it,
it doesn't matter.

34:28.858 --> 34:30.656
And in light of the story
you told me the other day,

34:30.735 --> 34:33.579
that's probably what someone you
know very well said to herself.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.290
Are you shitting me?

34:36.408 --> 34:38.502
You're comparing me to her?
I most certainly am.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.000
Right down to you putting Donna in
a position not to say anything.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.501
Donna is not an
8-year-old boy.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.753
And I'm not cheating
on my wife.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.755
No, but you're putting two
people you care about

34:45.833 --> 34:47.085
in positions to feel betrayed.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.215
Betrayed?
Yes.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.297
Like when someone has an
affair with someone else.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.597
Okay. You don't get
to say that to me.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.474
It's my job to say
things like that to you.

34:53.550 --> 34:54.641
Then you don't know what
you're talking about,

34:54.717 --> 34:56.436
because I have lived
my whole life

34:56.511 --> 34:57.763
not to be her.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.894
And when people do that,
they very often become

34:59.973 --> 35:01.475
that very thing in
a different way.

35:01.725 --> 35:03.022
Well, I'm not
goddamn her!

35:03.101 --> 35:04.523
Well, then, you'd better
take a look in the mirror.

35:05.353 --> 35:06.605
Because you made a promise,

35:06.688 --> 35:08.361
snuck behind someone's
back to break it,

35:08.440 --> 35:10.989
and when confronted with that fact,
you're denying all responsibility.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.785
That sounds like
an affair to me.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.035
MIKE: You wanted to see me?

35:20.869 --> 35:22.837
Do you how hard I worked to
get a view like this?

35:24.539 --> 35:25.882
Full scholarship to Vassar.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.213
Three years Harvard Law.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.762
And one year as the
first black woman

35:30.837 --> 35:32.305
to clerk in the
Third Circuit.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.476
And I'm not going to
waste all that hard work

35:36.551 --> 35:38.224
just to let someone
take everything away.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.106
Jessica, as far
as I can tell,

35:42.223 --> 35:44.146
Jack Soloff is holding up
his end of the bargain.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.606
He's doing more than that.

35:45.685 --> 35:48.564
He just sent out an email
nominating you for junior partner.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.149
And you're gonna figure
out a way to turn it down.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.779
What?
Go ahead, take a minute.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.115
Congratulations,
you've earned it.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.620
You are the best associate
I have ever seen.

36:00.450 --> 36:01.576
Now, these are your options.

36:02.911 --> 36:05.505
Medical issues,
family emergency,

36:05.580 --> 36:06.581
you're just not ready.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.500
Whatever it is, you simply

36:08.583 --> 36:10.551
cannot accept a junior
partnership at this time.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.345
Jessica, no one
turns down partner.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.421
Well, they do now.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.927
Because I'm not sending
out a press release

36:15.006 --> 36:17.805
announcing Mike Ross of
Harvard just got promoted.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.852
Then don't send one out.
You're not hearing me.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.100
No, you're not hearing me.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.477
What do you think is gonna
happen when word gets out

36:23.556 --> 36:24.808
that I was offered
the one thing

36:24.891 --> 36:27.610
that every associate dreams
of and I turned it down?

36:27.769 --> 36:28.770
Nothing's going to happen.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.197
Because you're going
to put your mind

36:31.272 --> 36:33.866
to finding a good reason
with as much enthusiasm

36:33.942 --> 36:37.446
as you did bullshitting your way
into this job in the first place.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.499
What is this?
You know what it is.

36:49.582 --> 36:50.583
A portfolio of business

36:50.667 --> 36:52.044
I want you to take to
Pearson Specter for me.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.128
I'm not doing it.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.130
This is an opportunity
for you, Jack.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.721
No, Daniel, it's an
opportunity for you,

36:58.800 --> 37:00.973
and I'm not interested
in carrying your water.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.188
Am I mistaken or did we
not have this discussion?

37:03.722 --> 37:05.895
<i>We discussed it once.</i>

37:05.974 --> 37:08.523
I remember. It was during
that same conversation

37:08.643 --> 37:10.020
we had when you
came to me for advice

37:10.103 --> 37:12.777
on the best way to stab
Harvey in the back.

37:12.856 --> 37:13.982
Uh, I get it.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.447
You did me a favor,
but I'm finished.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.866
I don't want your advice or
your shortcuts anymore.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.913
Because all it did was
almost get me fired.

37:20.989 --> 37:22.912
So, please,
just take this.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.501
Well, you've always
been a grinder, Jack.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.164
What's that
supposed to mean?

37:30.248 --> 37:31.340
I admire it.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.089
But you're not
just a grinder,

37:33.168 --> 37:34.420
you have a chip
on your shoulder.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.220
And the thing I've
noticed about people with

37:36.296 --> 37:37.718
chips on their shoulder

37:38.173 --> 37:39.891
is that somewhere
along the way,

37:40.842 --> 37:43.095
they went to great
lengths to get 'em off.

37:44.554 --> 37:46.181
I got the chip
off my shoulder.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.433
I got Jessica's respect.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.186
She doesn't respect you.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.356
And that's not the
chip I'm talking about.

37:56.149 --> 37:57.196
Don't call me again.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.422
Esther, what are
you doing here?

38:12.373 --> 38:15.343
I'm actually going out to
dinner with Louis and Donna.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.546
Well, thanks for the invitation,
but that's the last thing

38:17.629 --> 38:18.881
in the world I want
to do right now.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.052
That's not why
I'm here.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.141
I was thinking about

38:22.217 --> 38:25.096
what you said about why
I called you first.

38:25.178 --> 38:27.476
And then, about how
you handled it.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.313
And I thought

38:31.392 --> 38:34.271
maybe you might want to
take rne out this weekend.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.779
Esther, what do you thinks
going on between us?

38:39.025 --> 38:40.493
I don't know, I just...
You don't know?

38:40.568 --> 38:41.569
Well, I'll tell you.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.868
We had a moment.
It was nice.

38:44.364 --> 38:45.991
But I'm not interested
in sneaking around.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.543
Who said anything about
sneaking around?

38:48.618 --> 38:51.542
I did. And you just
got divorced,

38:51.621 --> 38:53.419
and you're a mother of two,

38:53.540 --> 38:55.258
and I'm not gonna
be the reason that...

38:55.333 --> 38:56.334
That what?

38:56.751 --> 38:57.752
That nothing.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.175
Why don't you just go
out to your dinner?

39:00.255 --> 39:02.553
Harvey, tell me
what's going on.

39:02.632 --> 39:05.010
What's going on is, you
asked me out and I said no.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.595
So, please, just
leave me alone.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.518
Harvey... (FORCEFULLY)
I said leave me alone.

39:15.144 --> 39:16.145
(SCOFFS)

39:20.692 --> 39:22.035
Did you make the
reservation at Sarabeth's?

39:22.110 --> 39:23.703
For the seventh time, yes.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.872
And why was it so important
that it be there anyway?

39:25.947 --> 39:27.494
Because their muffins are 10
times better than Esther's

39:27.574 --> 39:28.575
and I just want her to know it.

39:28.658 --> 39:29.875
(CHUCKLES) I thought you
two made progress.

39:29.951 --> 39:30.998
Well, she's still
my sister.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.829
And I can't let her think that
she's the best at something.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.129
Okay- Hey.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.459
Wait, what's wrong?
You look upset.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.465
Nothing's wrong. I, I'm
just not feeling very well.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.343
It looks like tonight's not
a good night after all.

39:42.422 --> 39:43.765
No, no, no, no.
You're upset.

39:44.257 --> 39:46.225
It's not that, Louis.
I just don't feel well.

39:46.843 --> 39:48.345
Please, let's
just reschedule.

39:53.683 --> 39:55.105
I'm gonna just call
the restaurant and...

39:55.184 --> 39:56.652
Wait a second, wait a
second, wait a second.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.691
She came all the way
down here just to cancel?

40:02.233 --> 40:05.112
I don't know, Louis. I mean, maybe she
was already on her way over here and...

40:05.194 --> 40:06.411
Did she just come
from Harvey's office?

40:06.487 --> 40:08.615
Because that's the direction she
came from, not the elevators.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.118
I don't know, Louis.
What do you want me to say?

40:15.663 --> 40:17.506
"I don't know"

40:17.582 --> 40:19.926
is exactly what you said when
I asked you if you thought

40:20.001 --> 40:21.753
there was anything going on
between Harvey and Esther.

40:21.836 --> 40:22.883
And now, you're
saying it again.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.557
But you're Donna
and you know everything.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.471
I'm sorry, Louis.
I do know.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.062
What are you gonna do?
None of your business.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.734
Stay out of it.
You've done enough.

40:37.936 --> 40:41.691
<i>Yes, you know,
and he stormed away...</i>

40:45.860 --> 40:47.157
You and I are gonna
have a talk right now.

40:47.236 --> 40:49.705
Okay. Whatever it is,
it can wait.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.286
I need to tell
you something.

40:51.366 --> 40:52.709
Does it have something to do
with why my sister

40:52.784 --> 40:54.661
just left here too upset to
go out to dinner?

40:55.870 --> 40:56.917
You piece of shit.
I knew it.

40:56.996 --> 40:57.963
What did you do to her now?

40:58.039 --> 40:59.791
I didn't do
anything to her, Louis.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.171
And when I say now,

41:01.250 --> 41:03.719
I mean as opposed to before
when you slept with her!

41:04.879 --> 41:05.880
That's right.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.716
Donna, the one you tried to
steal from rne at dinner

41:07.840 --> 41:09.057
the other night, told me.
Calm down.

41:09.175 --> 41:11.394
I didn't try to steal anyone.
You made a promise to me!

41:12.720 --> 41:13.812
And even after I told you

41:13.888 --> 41:15.811
about when Esther and I were
kids and the boys used me

41:15.890 --> 41:18.313
to get to her, you still went
ahead and betrayed me.

41:18.393 --> 41:19.986
Louis, it had already
happened.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.904
And I was just now
about to tell you.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.147
Bullshit. You were never
gonna tell me.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.824
You were gonna keep it to
yourself to the day you die.

41:24.899 --> 41:25.946
Louis, you have to
believe me.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.993
I swear I was just
about to tell you.

41:28.069 --> 41:29.787
What you're about to do
is get your ass kicked!

41:29.862 --> 41:31.034
All right, watch yourself.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.866
Don't threaten something
you can't handle.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.166
You don't think I
can handle you?

41:34.242 --> 41:36.165
You also thought I was
too stupid to find out.

41:36.244 --> 41:37.245
But I did find out.

41:37.578 --> 41:40.297
I found out that you're nothing
but a lying, cheating...

41:40.373 --> 41:41.920
I didn't cheat with Esther.

41:42.041 --> 41:45.170
It was two grown people making a
goddamn decision for themselves.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.347
Well, that decision ended with
her walking out of here

41:47.422 --> 41:49.675
near tears because she
didn't have all the facts.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.475
Like the fact that you're
a serial womanizer

41:51.592 --> 41:52.684
who can't stand when
anyone else has...

41:52.760 --> 41:53.727
Shut the hell up!

41:53.803 --> 41:55.521
So, he takes
whatever woman's in sight.

41:55.596 --> 41:56.893
I'm telling you...
Because he's so messed up

41:56.973 --> 41:58.099
from whatever
goddamn thing

41:58.182 --> 41:59.684
happened to him in his
pathetic childhood that...

41:59.767 --> 42:00.734
Shut the hell up!

42:00.810 --> 42:01.936
He can't...
(GRUNTS)

42:06.441 --> 42:07.738
(GLASS SHATTERS)

42:11.904 --> 42:12.871
Harvey.

42:12.947 --> 42:13.948
Get away from me.

42:15.408 --> 42:16.785
You get the
hell out of here.

42:25.626 --> 42:31.304
<i>But they told you, convinced
you that I'd play...</i>
