I THINK I WAS IN A STATE
OF SHOCK FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

46:39.564 --> 46:41.397

I'M SORRY.

46:52.977 --> 46:55.945
SO WHILE I'M WITH THE DOCTORS,
THE WORLD CUP IS GOING,

46:55.947 --> 46:58.247
MY PHONE IS RINGING,
AND ARI PICKS UP THE PHONE.

46:58.249 --> 47:00.216
AND SHE SAID, "MOM,
IT'S GRANDMA.

47:00.218 --> 47:02.185
SHE'S REALLY UPSET.
YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS CALL."

47:02.187 --> 47:04.353
SO I WENT OUT
INTO THE HALLWAY,

47:04.355 --> 47:07.390

DAD WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE,

47:07.392 --> 47:09.292

ON THE TABLE.

47:09.294 --> 47:11.260

47:14.232 --> 47:15.898
NONE OF THIS WAS SEEN

TO THE GROUND.

WAS HAPPENING.

47:24.809 --> 47:26.175

AFTER JUST SEEING THE STATE
OF WHAT YOUR BODY LOOKED LIKE,

47:32.383 --> 47:35.351

LOOKED LIKE BEFORE,

47:35.353 --> 47:36.819

KNEW THAT MY DAD WAS GONNA LIVE,

I WAS IN A STATE OF PANIC.

47:43.161 --> 47:45.595
YEAH. AND SEEING HER
GO DOWN LIKE THAT,

47:45.597 --> 47:48.931
IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT
I HAD TO BE THE ONE

47:48.933 --> 47:50.700

AS MUCH AS I COULD

47:50.702 --> 47:52.835

WAS GONNA BE OKAY,

TO HER

THE SAME THING.
