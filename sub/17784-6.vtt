01:01.829 --> 01:03.131
Hi.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.737
Not really sure
how this works.

01:09.737 --> 01:13.141
Why don't you tell me
how long it's been since
your last confession?

01:13.141 --> 01:15.209
Uh, never.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.577
Never?

01:16.577 --> 01:18.712
Nope, I'm Jewish.

01:18.712 --> 01:22.416
But I've always
wondered what goes on
inside these things.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.753
Wouldn't you be more
comfortable speaking
to your rabbi?

01:25.753 --> 01:27.155
Nah.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.223
I don't really trust
guys with beards.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.624
I'm sorry, you don't have
a beard, do you?

01:30.624 --> 01:31.859
No.

01:31.859 --> 01:32.860
Okay, good.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.495
Um...

01:34.495 --> 01:38.166
Is there something troubling
you that I can help you with?

01:38.166 --> 01:39.267
Hmm.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.369
How long you got?

01:41.369 --> 01:43.737
I mean, is there something
weighing on your conscience

01:43.737 --> 01:45.539
you'd like
to confess?

01:45.539 --> 01:47.441
To confess?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.509
Well...

01:49.677 --> 01:52.413
Uh, I cheated at
tennis last week.

01:52.413 --> 01:55.883
But it was kind of
on the line, could have
gone either way.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.186
And, uh...

01:58.186 --> 02:00.588
I lied to my wife.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.490
I told her we were
out of gin.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.326
I poured it down
the kitchen sink.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.761
Anything else?

02:07.761 --> 02:09.197
Well...

02:09.197 --> 02:11.332
If you were to ask
our state's attorney,

02:11.332 --> 02:14.202
he'd say I'm guilty of
financial crimes,

02:14.202 --> 02:15.869
but the guy is
such an asshole...

02:15.869 --> 02:17.371
Sorry, pardon my language.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.673
And are you? Guilty?

02:19.673 --> 02:22.576
What, did I do anything
that half of Wall Street

02:22.576 --> 02:25.313
isn't out there
right now doing? Fuck, no.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.914
Sorry, again.
The language.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.383
We'll tally up the profanity
and deal with it at the end.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.719
Okay, that seems fair.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.254
Uh...

02:33.254 --> 02:36.424
I like it here.
Nice.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.125
Smells like cinnamon.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.095
Some parishes are doing
away with confessionals.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.664
Why?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.299
The feeling is that
modern Catholics would

02:45.299 --> 02:47.468
prefer to see their
confessor face to face.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.237
See, that's what's
wrong with the world.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.038
Nobody can leave
well enough alone.

02:51.038 --> 02:54.107
You know, as soon as you
got everything figured out,

02:54.107 --> 02:55.443
you're going along
pretty good,

02:55.443 --> 02:58.346
then the rules change.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.248
There's one thing
that doesn't change.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.114
What?

03:01.114 --> 03:02.650
God's love for us.

03:02.650 --> 03:07.421
Yeah, well, I don't
really believe in God.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.490
But, I mean, no offense.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.659
He believes in you.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.696
Okay, well...

03:15.696 --> 03:17.365
Tell him I could
use his help.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.871
Actually, I should get back.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.640
I don't want to be late
for my own trial.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.808
Go in peace.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.010
Thank you.
I'm not sure how this works.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.480
There's a collection
box outside.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.981
Consider it
the swear jar.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.284
Fair enough.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.719
Thank you.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.021
It was good talking
to you, Padre.

03:41.021 --> 03:41.989
You, too.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.561
Phew.

04:08.115 --> 04:11.319
Good morning, my beloved.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.420
What are you doing?

04:12.420 --> 04:13.887
Merely watching you sleep.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.223
Not in any creepy or
obsessive way, of course.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.625
Am I that interesting?

04:17.625 --> 04:19.059
Riveting.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.861
If you were on television,
I would watch you every week.

04:20.861 --> 04:26.667
Then way you breathe in...
and then out.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.337
Well, I have had
a lot of practice.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.340
You are a delight.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.049
I've never seen a house
with so many mirrors.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.990
Thank you for
a wonderful evening.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.360
Oh, my darling,
I should be thanking you.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.227
I'm... I'm sorry
we didn't...

04:54.227 --> 04:56.397
Hush. Don't apologize,
my dear.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.632
I'm happy to
just spoon.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.769
We have our whole
lives to fuck.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.840
I'll see you soon.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.841
All rise.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.762
Mmm.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.731
How could you mess up
a screwdriver?

06:03.731 --> 06:05.433
It's only two ingredients.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.867
Sorry, Herb.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.169
Just get me a vodka
and prune juice.

06:09.169 --> 06:09.970
What's that called?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.705
A Russian enema.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.873
Hi.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.442
What are you doing tonight?

06:14.442 --> 06:16.977
Uh, I don't know.
Why?

06:16.977 --> 06:19.112
I checked with my parents,
and they said it was okay

06:19.112 --> 06:22.249
if you came over to give me
a private lesson.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.717
Oh.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.819
Is six cool for you?

06:25.819 --> 06:26.987
Um...

06:26.987 --> 06:30.323
Great. See you then,

06:30.323 --> 06:31.792
Okay.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.663
Jail time.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.600
At this time, we will
recess for lunch.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.603
Court will resume in
exactly one hour.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.587
Why aren't you
at the club?

06:59.587 --> 07:01.589
I didn't have any
lessons this morning,

07:01.589 --> 07:03.757
and I figured he could
use the moral support.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.226
Fucking trial.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.628
What a farce.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.797
Can you believe
that state's attorney?

07:09.797 --> 07:12.600
Looks like a fucking lounge act
with that comb-over.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.568
That's the real crime.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.510
- Hey.
- Hello.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.711
Here's your mail.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.145
Why the post office
can't understand

07:25.145 --> 07:27.247
that we don't live together
anymore is beyond me.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.683
Hmm.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.919
So, how've you been?

07:31.919 --> 07:32.953
Fine.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.154
You sure?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.523
What's that mean?

07:35.523 --> 07:37.290
David is worried about you.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.391
No, he's not.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.660
At his age,
they're not capable

07:39.660 --> 07:42.395
of thinking about
anybody but themselves.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.664
Mmm, not our David.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.533
Yes, our David,
and it's fine.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.035
He should be worried about
himself instead of drifting
along aimlessly.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.137
I know.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.805
That's the thing
with their generation.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.841
You know, they don't want
careers, they want callings.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.075
Not enough to get
a paycheck.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.276
Maybe.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.546
You know what it is?

07:58.546 --> 07:59.780
They never fought a war.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.448
Oh, God, Sam, don't
even say that.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.116
No, you know what I mean.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.653
When I came back from Korea,
I was happy just to have a job

08:05.653 --> 08:07.320
where nobody was
shooting at me.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.390
Move into a house
with five guys,
we ate ketchup sandwiches.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.693
Didn't talk about
job satisfaction,

08:12.693 --> 08:14.562
we talked about
sports or girls.

08:14.562 --> 08:17.565
Do you think we should
sit him down and have
a talk with him?

08:17.565 --> 08:19.366
I don't know.

08:19.366 --> 08:22.302
He's not a kid anymore,
he's 21 years old.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.204
He'll always be my baby.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.072
What is that?

08:25.072 --> 08:27.575
- Pastrami on rye.
- Sam!

08:27.575 --> 08:29.577
Take it easy,
it's tuna salad.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.351
We got married near here.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.820
Oh, yeah?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.722
City clerk's office,
fourth street.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.356
A block that way.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.760
My father wasn't about to
pay for any big wedding,

08:46.760 --> 08:49.296
or any wedding,
for that matter.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.799
So we jumped on
the C-train,

08:51.799 --> 08:54.134
and came down here,
brought my friend Brenda

08:54.134 --> 08:55.603
as a witness.

08:56.870 --> 09:00.608
We didn't have a pot
to piss in back then.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.276
You know how big
our first place was?

09:03.276 --> 09:05.679
280 square feet.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.214
Seriously?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.649
Yeah, it was a dump.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.483
Had more mice than windows.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.019
But we didn't care.

09:12.019 --> 09:15.055
We just wanted
to be together.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.957
I could do it again
if I had to.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.460
But he can't.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.363
That man loves
what he does.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.299
Let those motherfuckers
take that away from him,
it will kill him.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.637
What do you say, gorgeous?

09:29.637 --> 09:31.404
Come on, let's go
grab a little lunch.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.973
Where are we going?

09:32.973 --> 09:35.876
Jerry knows a great
Italian joint, right
around the corner.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.713
You want to join us?

09:39.713 --> 09:42.650
Oh, thanks, but I have
some stuff I need to do.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.385
Okay.

09:45.385 --> 09:48.188
- Bye, David.
- Bye.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.289
Nobody pushes a button?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.026
Hi-ya, Sam.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.161
Harry.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.096
Hey, I've been
meaning to ask you,

09:56.096 --> 09:58.666
any luck finding
that Soon Hi?

09:58.666 --> 09:59.933
No.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.368
No, the guy at
the Korean embassy said

10:01.368 --> 10:03.470
the chances of finding somebody
with the last name Lee

10:03.470 --> 10:05.272
are about one in a million.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.041
Actually, 40 million
because that's how many
South Koreans there are.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.843
Well, therein lies
your problem, Sam.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.045
You're searching in
the wrong country.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.413
What?

10:13.413 --> 10:16.316
She's not in Korea,
she's here in the states.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.219
What?

10:19.219 --> 10:21.421
I got in touch with
a friend of mine at INS.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.157
He tells me she immigrated
here in 1963.

10:24.157 --> 10:27.327
Four years later, she became
a naturalized citizen.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.395
You're kidding me?

10:28.395 --> 10:29.596
You're sure it's her?

10:29.596 --> 10:31.231
Only one way to find out.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.667
- What's that?
- Her last known address.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.372
I think she's right
outside of Scranton.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.478
All these years, she's living
two hours away from me.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.251
Happy hunting, brother.

10:53.253 --> 10:57.224
Jane is a blank student.
She studies for hours
before every test.

10:57.224 --> 11:00.060
The answer is
a, meticulous, b, relaxed,

11:00.060 --> 11:02.796
c, lackadaisical,
d, apathetic,

11:02.796 --> 11:04.732
or e, lethargic.

11:04.732 --> 11:05.799
Oh.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.334
Was that your leg?
Sorry.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.036
You're totally blushing.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.338
No, I'm not, it's just...
it's really hot in here.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.206
What's going on
in here, you two?

11:13.206 --> 11:15.508
Nothing, Mr. Collins.
We're just going
over some vocab

11:15.508 --> 11:17.477
because there's vocab
on the test.

11:17.477 --> 11:20.113
It really trips people up if
they don't know they're, um...

11:20.113 --> 11:21.314
How much am I
paying you an hour?

11:21.314 --> 11:22.950
Daddy!

11:22.950 --> 11:24.584
Just kidding!
Mom and I won't be
out too late.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.287
I left some money on
the credenza if you
want to get pizza.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.390
Sadly, her mother and
I are having dinner
with the neighbors.

11:36.596 --> 11:39.132
Anybody here had sex?

11:39.132 --> 11:40.801
Just me?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.269
That's odd.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.439
Talk to you later.
Yep.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.209
I'm not much of
a cuddler after sex.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.144
I'm good for maybe,
like, one hug and then

11:51.144 --> 11:53.613
I'm like, "Could you
get me a water?

11:53.613 --> 11:56.884
You know, from the 7-11
across town?"

11:58.218 --> 12:00.120
While you're there,
just get an application,

12:00.120 --> 12:02.055
take the job, work there
for about a year, come back,

12:02.055 --> 12:04.324
then maybe I'll be ready
to cuddle again.

12:05.692 --> 12:08.929
I like sex.
It's the dating part
I'm not good at, you know?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.097
Everybody asks
the same questions, like,

12:10.097 --> 12:12.199
"What school did you go to?"

12:12.199 --> 12:14.201
"What year did you graduate?"

12:14.201 --> 12:16.436
"How long has that sore
been on your lip?"

12:17.871 --> 12:19.506
Can I get a little help?

12:23.710 --> 12:25.312
How long do we
have to stay?

12:25.312 --> 12:27.815
Will you please stop
being a grump?

12:27.815 --> 12:29.016
I'm not being a grump,
I'm just beat.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.650
I've had a long week.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.153
How do you think I feel?
I'm coming off a double shift.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.721
Yeah, so wouldn't you rather
go to your apartment and

12:34.721 --> 12:35.989
rent a movie or something?

12:35.989 --> 12:38.291
We can stay in anytime.

12:38.291 --> 12:41.094
And we're here to
support Zan.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.562
Zan doesn't like me.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.264
Zan doesn't like anyone.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.166
- So you admit it?
- Oh, here it is.

12:51.571 --> 12:52.873
What's wrong?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.709
We hardly ever get to
see each other anymore.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.379
So I was looking forward
to it just being us tonight.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.558
One hour.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.860
Okay?

13:12.860 --> 13:14.461
And then you can have me
all to yourself.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.541
- Thanks.
- Here we go.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.581
Mmm.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.883
What is this?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.250
Schnapps and
Dr. Pepper.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.419
I figured I'd better use
one of the bottles

13:39.419 --> 13:40.720
from the back of
the liquor cabinet

13:40.720 --> 13:42.489
so my folks
wouldn't notice.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.425
- I can't let you
drink this, Tabitha.
- Why not?

13:45.425 --> 13:48.161
Because you're underage
which means your brain
is still developing.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.664
And because Hitler
drank Schnapps.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.167
Let's not talk
about Hitler.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.603
Whoa, whoa, Tabitha.
Wait.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.305
What's wrong?

13:58.305 --> 14:00.007
We can't, I'm your teacher.
You're 17 years old.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.109
Only until next month.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.311
Even so, it just
wouldn't be right.

14:04.311 --> 14:07.047
It's not what
your father's paying me for.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.384
I guess you're right.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.922
I'm sorry, Tabitha.
You're a great girl.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.556
I just--

14:18.725 --> 14:19.826
What the fuck?

14:19.826 --> 14:21.328
Eli, what are you
doing here?

14:21.328 --> 14:23.230
- That's my girlfriend!
- Ex-girlfriend.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.465
Yeah, I'm still
in love with you.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.500
Well, you should have thought
of that before you fingered
Cindy Chang.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.936
I'm just going to
let myself out.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.639
Stop! Eli!

14:34.041 --> 14:35.976
You were so great.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.310
The crowd sucked.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.578
Oh, really?
I didn't think so.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.014
They were laughing.
I was laughing.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.449
I mean, what?

14:42.449 --> 14:44.184
I guess some of it
worked okay.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.086
My diaphragm bit
always kills.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.988
Oh, that was so funny!

14:47.988 --> 14:49.789
Oh, and I also loved
that joke about

14:49.789 --> 14:52.192
the birthmark of
Gorbachev's head.

14:52.192 --> 14:56.029
I'm always confused, do you
call them jokes or bits or--

14:59.832 --> 15:00.968
What?

15:00.968 --> 15:02.769
Nothing.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.071
You just surprise me.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.745
My father's trial was
supposed to start today.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.814
Yeah.

15:14.814 --> 15:18.218
My mother's been leaving
messages on my machine all week
trying to get me to come.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.088
But I figured, why?

15:21.088 --> 15:23.423
It's not like there's
anything I can do.

15:26.994 --> 15:30.497
It's... it's really
something, isn't it?

15:30.497 --> 15:32.532
It's all toilets.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.801
It really makes you consider
this everyday object

15:34.801 --> 15:38.071
we take for granted
as, like, domestic sculpture.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.275
Hey, kids.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.676
Zan!

15:46.813 --> 15:48.315
This is Simon
and Adelaide.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.650
Adelaide teaches life drawing
at the new school.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.919
And this is Skye,
we work together.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.087
Hello.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.523
Hi, and this is
my boyfriend, David.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.792
Zan, your installation
is amazing.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.396
It takes Duchamp's Fountain
to a whole 'nother level.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.597
Thanks.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.833
You shoot it on Standard
or Super 16?

16:06.833 --> 16:07.900
Super 8, actually.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.036
Are you a filmmaker, too?

16:09.036 --> 16:10.670
Aspiring, I guess.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.839
I was going to go to NYU,
but it didn't work out.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.642
Oh, you're lucky.
Those are four years
you would never get back.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.110
Oh, you didn't go
to film school?

16:17.110 --> 16:19.046
God, no. Brown.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.047
What was your major?

16:20.047 --> 16:21.281
Semiotics.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.483
Does your film
have a title?

16:23.483 --> 16:24.584
Crapper.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.619
Fitting.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.189
To be honest, it's not
what I would have chosen
for tonight.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.925
It's not really representative
of my recent work.

16:32.925 --> 16:37.097
Hey, does anyone feel like
joining me for a little...

16:37.097 --> 16:38.398
No, thanks.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.067
I just took a cat valium.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.068
Kids?

16:41.068 --> 16:42.602
No, I'm good.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.471
I will.

16:44.471 --> 16:48.141
Excuse us gals while we go
powder our noses.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.084
I just think you two
would really hit it off

16:57.084 --> 16:58.485
if you had a chance to
get to know each other.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.486
- I mean...
- Uh-huh.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.788
David is super into film.

17:01.788 --> 17:02.955
Especially French New Wave.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.757
He's obsessed
with Erich Rohmer.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.159
Of course he is.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.796
He's just in a bad mood
tonight for some reason.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.698
Look, Skye, you don't
have to defend him to me.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.766
All right, I get it.
There's comfort
in the familiar.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.969
I didn't break up with
my high school boyfriend

17:16.969 --> 17:18.338
until... junior year
of college.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.108
David isn't my high
school boyfriend.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.642
Oh.

17:22.642 --> 17:26.313
I mean, we've only been dating
for, like, a year.

17:31.751 --> 17:32.819
Hi.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.354
I'm starving, want to go
over to sixth street

17:34.354 --> 17:35.755
and get
some Indian food?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.724
No, I don't want to eat,
I want to dance.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.226
Come on, come on,
dance with me.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.260
It'll cheer you up.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.494
I don't need cheering up.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.896
Why are you being
so lame tonight?

17:43.896 --> 17:46.533
I'm not being lame,
this place is lame.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.501
I don't get it, I thought
you'd be inspired.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.837
What, by a bunch of
pretentious posers

17:50.837 --> 17:53.506
and a movie about toilets?

17:53.506 --> 17:56.843
I think you need to be
a little more open-minded.

17:56.843 --> 18:00.046
Come on, where's that sexy
break-dancer I used to know.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.981
Wishing he was
somewhere else.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.049
Fine.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.184
- We can go?
- You can.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.319
I'm staying.
I'm having fun.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.054
Well, will you be okay
getting home by yourself?

18:08.054 --> 18:11.258
Of course, just go.
Excuse me.

18:11.258 --> 18:14.427
Gingivitis can progress
to periodontitis

18:14.427 --> 18:16.529
which can lead to
bone resorption

18:16.529 --> 18:19.031
and eventually, tooth loss.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.168
Are you all right?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.337
Oh my God.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.805
What happened?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.209
I got beat up.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.243
By who?

18:30.243 --> 18:31.711
That kid, Eli.

18:31.711 --> 18:32.979
What, your student?

18:32.979 --> 18:34.781
Okay, let me take a look.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.915
Is it bad, doc?

18:35.915 --> 18:38.084
Okay, change of
plans, gang.

18:38.084 --> 18:43.223
Instead of gum inflammation
we're going to jump ahead
to emergency dentistry.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.992
Misty, prep a chair.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.460
All right.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.768
Hey.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.704
What are you doing here?

18:57.704 --> 19:00.207
I was just dropping off a
box of cat toys to your dad,

19:00.207 --> 19:02.675
but I didn't want to wake him,
so I was going to leave them.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.411
Oh, cool.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.879
Late night snack?

19:06.879 --> 19:09.382
Oh, yeah, I was at this stupid
art opening in the city

19:09.382 --> 19:11.251
and there wasn't any food.
So...

19:12.785 --> 19:15.422
Do you remember that
time senior year
when we cut class

19:15.422 --> 19:17.290
and we just drove
to Asbury Park

19:17.290 --> 19:19.292
and we sat on the beach
and ate KFC?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.860
And it was super windy.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.895
And then the seagull, like,
stole the chicken wing?

19:22.895 --> 19:25.298
Yeah, which, if you think
about it is just wrong.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.066
Totally gross.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.601
Cannibals.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.673
Uh...

19:33.673 --> 19:36.008
- You hungry?
- Me? Um...

19:36.008 --> 19:38.445
I mean, you know, it's not
like I'm going to eat
all this by myself.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.079
Well, what about your dad?

19:40.079 --> 19:42.949
His cardiologist doesn't
want him eating fried food.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.521
You know what?
Why not?

19:48.521 --> 19:49.756
Okay.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.427
It's not just about
capturing form.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.029
- Mmm.
- Or reproducing the real.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.431
Yeah.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.900
I'm trying to invite
the spectator into the work.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.402
- Right, of course you are.
- Start a dialogue.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.503
Skye, where do you
keep the corkscrew?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.204
Uh, it's, um,
on the counter.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.539
By the sink.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.475
Technically, you're
very proficient.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.676
That's not the problem.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.743
Oh?

20:10.743 --> 20:13.313
Yeah, the problem is
a lack of point of view.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.581
Something to say.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.350
Like I tell my students,
perspective, voice.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.218
Call it what you want,
it's missing.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.420
You can feel it.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.256
There's this emptiness
to your work.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.924
They're like, uh...

20:24.924 --> 20:26.726
Cadavers.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.496
Which, don't get me wrong, can
actually be quite beautiful.

20:29.496 --> 20:32.499
But these aren't.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.537
Uh, okay.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.318
How are things
with Skye?

20:51.318 --> 20:52.952
Complicated.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.186
Sorry.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.155
No, I mean,
good complicated.

20:56.155 --> 20:58.190
For the most part.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.726
We just had a fight.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.994
Not really a fight
so much as a disagreement.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.733
Never going to be able to
fit into my wedding dress.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.235
You still have a month
to Jazzercise it off.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.970
Please don't remind me.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.705
You nervous?

21:12.705 --> 21:15.074
No.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.843
Yeah.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.712
Actually, if I'm being honest,
I'm kind of freaking out.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.047
Why?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.450
I don't know, just...

21:23.450 --> 21:25.452
Getting married's like,
a really huge deal.

21:25.452 --> 21:28.988
You know, there's lot of
decisions, like,

21:28.988 --> 21:31.924
do I want
roses or tulips?

21:31.924 --> 21:34.627
Chocolate cake or
vanilla butter cream?

21:34.627 --> 21:37.263
And then there's the big one.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.866
"Do you take this man?"

21:39.866 --> 21:41.701
How am I supposed
to answer that?

21:41.701 --> 21:44.136
I'm pretty sure you're
supposed to say "I do."

21:44.136 --> 21:45.972
But do I?

21:45.972 --> 21:49.676
I mean, I do, now
that I think, but...

21:49.676 --> 21:52.879
How do I know
I'll feel the same
when I get older?

21:52.879 --> 21:56.783
'Til death do you part
is a really long time.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.653
It's overwhelming.

22:02.389 --> 22:06.058
It's weird to think
how much less complicated
life used to be.

22:06.058 --> 22:08.861
Not even that long ago.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.099
I know.

22:13.099 --> 22:16.403
I kind of miss it sometimes.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.904
Me, too.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.415
Thanks, again.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.883
Sorry, I didn't know
where else to go.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.118
No, it's okay.

22:32.118 --> 22:35.187
It was so scary, Misty.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.757
I remember thinking, like,

22:37.757 --> 22:39.959
whoa, dude, this is
how it ends.

22:39.959 --> 22:44.431
And then, who's gonna remind
Nana to take her pills?

22:45.798 --> 22:48.468
You're a good guy, Wheeler.

22:48.468 --> 22:51.337
Yeah, after this,
I'm swearing off women.

22:51.337 --> 22:53.673
Maybe just underage ones?

22:53.673 --> 22:56.142
Yeah, but they're the only ones
who are interested in me.

22:57.444 --> 22:58.978
That's not true.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.089
All right.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.766
- That was a mistake.
- It was.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.200
I mean, what
were we thinking?

23:21.200 --> 23:22.535
We weren't,
that's the problem.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.036
I'm a terrible person.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.473
No, you're not, this is
my fault, not yours.

23:26.473 --> 23:27.874
No, I kissed you first.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.476
Yeah, I didn't
exactly stop you.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.177
How could I even
do this to Barry?

23:31.177 --> 23:32.679
I mean, he's so good to me
and he loves me so much.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.547
He really does.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.282
I just keep thinking
that maybe I did this

23:36.282 --> 23:37.717
on purpose, you know?

23:37.717 --> 23:41.888
Like maybe I secretly
wanted this to happen.

23:41.888 --> 23:42.989
Why?

23:42.989 --> 23:45.892
So I could have an excuse
not to marry Barry.

23:45.892 --> 23:49.195
You don't need
an excuse, Karen.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.297
Do you love him?

23:51.297 --> 23:53.132
Yeah.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.667
I really do.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.504
But that's what's
so confusing.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.109
Oh. Heya, kids.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.578
Hi, Mr. Meyers.
I'm really sorry,
we didn't mean to wake you.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.679
Oh, no, no,
don't be silly.

24:06.679 --> 24:07.947
It's good to see you.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.649
I am looking forward
to your wedding.

24:09.649 --> 24:12.018
Won't be long now.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.219
I know.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.392
I'm gonna get going,
'cause it's late.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.694
Okay.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.065
Oh, I almost forgot.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.134
Um, well, Barry and I
were wondering

24:28.134 --> 24:31.003
if you would consider maybe
videoing the wedding for us?

24:32.304 --> 24:33.405
Wouldn't that be
kind of awkward?

24:33.405 --> 24:35.542
Not for me.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.546
Sure.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.947
Okay.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.325
A sweet girl.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.327
Nice you two could
remain friends.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.929
Yeah.

25:05.071 --> 25:09.075
One wing won't kill you.
Go ahead, I won't tell Mom.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.088
Oh, Mother of God.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.598
**

26:05.798 --> 26:07.900
**

26:11.671 --> 26:15.307
* I could feel at the time *

26:15.307 --> 26:19.712
* There was no way
of knowing *

26:19.712 --> 26:23.149
* Fallen leaves
in the night *

26:23.149 --> 26:26.719
* Who can say where
they're blowing *

26:26.719 --> 26:31.891
* As free as the wind *

26:31.891 --> 26:34.226
* Hopefully learning *

26:34.226 --> 26:38.931
* Why the sea on the tide *

26:38.931 --> 26:42.368
* Has no way of turning *

26:45.504 --> 26:49.041
* More than this *

26:49.041 --> 26:52.845
* There is nothing *

26:52.845 --> 26:56.182
* More than this *

26:56.182 --> 27:00.486
* Tell me one thing *

27:00.486 --> 27:03.890
* More than this *

27:03.890 --> 27:09.696
* There is nothing *

27:15.401 --> 27:19.405
* More than this *

27:19.405 --> 27:22.742
* There is nothing *

27:22.742 --> 27:25.778
* More than this *

27:30.516 --> 27:32.752
* More than this *

27:35.287 --> 27:39.859
* Nothing *
