00:12.750 --> 00:16.041
Tony, it's Waffle Wednesday.
Your favorite.

00:16.041 --> 00:19.541
- Eh, I'm not hungry.
- Honey, why so blue?

00:19.541 --> 00:22.791
I don't know, Dina.
I think I lost my mojo.

00:22.791 --> 00:25.083
I haven't given a creature
a cold in weeks.

00:25.083 --> 00:27.916
Hey, we all get in a slump sometimes.

00:27.916 --> 00:31.541
But remember how good you feel
when you get creatures sick?

00:31.541 --> 00:34.458
Last time I checked,
nothing gets your germ dick harder.

00:34.458 --> 00:36.875
Dina! The kids will hear.

00:36.875 --> 00:39.166
They can watch for all I freakin' care.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.458
- Daddy!
- Speak of the little devils.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.583
Look what we drew.

00:42.583 --> 00:44.375
He's got fever and diarrhea.

00:44.375 --> 00:47.041
- That's because of you.
- Now, off to work.

00:47.041 --> 00:48.916
And, hey, if you get 'em real sick,

00:48.916 --> 00:52.208
I'll have a big, wet slice of Dina pie
waiting for you.

00:52.208 --> 00:55.208
Oh, I do love wife pie
before dinner.

00:55.208 --> 00:58.041
- No fair! We want Mommy's pie.
- Yeah.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.916
Mwah. Mwah. When you're older.

00:59.916 --> 01:02.291
- All right. Bye, everyone.
- Bye, Daddy.

01:02.875 --> 01:07.291
"My lawyers will be in touch."

01:07.291 --> 01:09.500
"Sincerely, comma,

01:09.500 --> 01:13.125
your son, comma, Joe Franklin."

01:13.125 --> 01:14.208
Here goes.

01:14.208 --> 01:17.583
Fingers crossed
he touches his face very soon.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.500
Oh, good! He's gross.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.416
Holy cannoli, I'm in the nose!

01:22.333 --> 01:25.458
- Bless you.
- Aw, shoot. Am I getting a cold?

01:25.458 --> 01:27.666
Looks that way. Hi, I'm Tony.

01:27.666 --> 01:30.875
Oh, hi. I'm Joe, uh...

01:30.875 --> 01:34.125
Should I go home?
I don't wanna spread a cold around.

01:34.125 --> 01:38.333
Right. Good call. But maybe
you should get a cup of tea first?

01:39.666 --> 01:44.125
Yeah. I-I guess that should be fine,
as long as I don't make out with anybody.

01:44.125 --> 01:46.583
There's my Morning Joe.

01:46.583 --> 01:49.750
Get over here, bubby.
Where's my breakfast kiss, huh?

01:49.750 --> 01:52.541
Oh. Hey, buddy. No breakfast kiss today.

01:52.541 --> 01:54.750
I-I think I'm really coming down
with something.

01:54.750 --> 01:58.458
Eh, I'm not worried about that shit, pal.
I never get sick, okay?

01:58.458 --> 02:00.458
Come on. French me, I dare you.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.416
No way he's gonna kiss him, right?

02:02.416 --> 02:05.583
- Okay.
- Oh my God, he is!

02:05.583 --> 02:08.000
Oh, more tongue, Joe. More tongue.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.166
It hurts. Every time.

02:11.666 --> 02:14.500
Dina, I'm doing it! I'm multiplying!

02:14.500 --> 02:16.875
- Who's Dina?
- She's our wife, and you love her.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.041
- Good luck out there.
- Likewise.

02:19.041 --> 02:19.958
Mmm.

02:19.958 --> 02:22.291
See? Told you. I'm freakin' invinci--

02:23.625 --> 02:26.166
Oh God, I'm sick.
I'm gonna sneeze all over these donuts.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.250
No, no, don't! Sneeze anywhere else.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.166
I can't control where.

02:30.166 --> 02:32.666
- It's a reflex. It's already happening.
- No, Gil.

02:32.666 --> 02:34.416
- Come on! What?
- Aaaa-choo!

02:34.416 --> 02:36.250
- Woo-hoo!
- We're an office cold!

02:36.250 --> 02:38.500
Ho-ho! We're all gonna bang
our wife tonight.

If you're sick, go home.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.458
- Don't be a hero.
- Oh, God.

03:19.916 --> 03:21.291
Cannonball!

03:22.083 --> 03:24.500
Ugh!

03:24.500 --> 03:27.291
Oh, shit. Am I getting a cold?

03:27.291 --> 03:30.291
My throat's all scritchy-scratchy.

03:30.291 --> 03:31.833
Connie, you sound sick.

03:31.833 --> 03:34.375
Why don't you come back to my place,
and I can take care of you.

03:34.375 --> 03:36.375
Eh, that's okay. I'll be fine.

03:36.375 --> 03:39.541
Oh, come on! I'll make you
some monster-ball soup.

03:39.541 --> 03:42.041
Really? Homemade? Like from s-crotch?

03:42.041 --> 03:44.166
Only the best for my baby.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.916
I'm not your baby.

03:45.916 --> 03:50.541
But my brain hurts,
and my joints are throbbin'.

03:50.541 --> 03:53.458
- Take me home and nurture me.
- Yay!

03:54.041 --> 03:57.750
There, there. Get all cozy-wozy
in Maury's beddie-weddie.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.708
It is pretty nice and warm.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.416
Yeah, that's right.

04:01.416 --> 04:03.750
'Cause I pee-peed the bed for you.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.583
Oh, listen to that cough.
I really got in there.

04:06.583 --> 04:09.083
Do you want a spready and a tucky?

04:09.083 --> 04:12.833
Uh, I'm a little gross
for sex stuff right now, Maury.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.666
No, silly. A spready...

04:15.666 --> 04:16.750
Oh!

04:16.750 --> 04:18.250
...and a tucky.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.875
A tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck.

04:19.875 --> 04:23.583
Oh, shit. I'm snug as a bug in a carpet.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.166
Now let me give you
some backie scratchies.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.583
That's okay.
I really don't like to be fussed over.

04:28.583 --> 04:32.083
- Oh, Lord.
- You like that, don't you?

04:32.083 --> 04:34.583
Yeah. I need you, Maury.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.416
You-- You need me?

04:36.416 --> 04:40.375
I do. I need you
to take care of baby Connie.

04:40.375 --> 04:43.458
Oh, you're so vulnerable and helpless.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.750
More backie scratchies please.

04:46.750 --> 04:49.583
Oh, shit. I hope you never get well.

04:49.583 --> 04:50.541
What's that?

04:50.541 --> 04:53.375
I said, uh, "Get some rest, pumpkin."

04:53.375 --> 04:55.291
I'm gonna start the soup,
so if you need me,

04:55.291 --> 04:58.250
I'll be squatting over a pot on the stove.

04:59.541 --> 05:02.000
A little more of that.
Oh, that'll take her out.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.125
Mmm!

05:03.125 --> 05:05.041
Smells funky in here, Maury.

05:05.041 --> 05:06.791
Connie! What-- What are you doing up?

05:06.791 --> 05:08.791
- I'm actually feeling a little better.
- No!

05:08.791 --> 05:11.750
- What?
- I meant, uh, no, please, have some soup.

05:11.750 --> 05:13.750
I really put my balls into this batch.

05:13.750 --> 05:16.416
Oh, thanks, but I'm not super hungry.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.708
Come on.
Just have a little taste for Daddy.

05:18.708 --> 05:21.000
Oh, I'm okay for now. Thank you, baby.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.625
Just open your goddamn mouth.

05:23.625 --> 05:25.416
- What?
- I-I just mean...

05:25.416 --> 05:29.291
Connie, I know you're a strong,
independent monstress--

05:29.291 --> 05:30.208
I am.

05:30.208 --> 05:34.041
But you deserve to be taken care of
every once in a while.

05:34.041 --> 05:39.166
And it would mean a lot to me, Maury,
if you'd just relax and have some soup.

05:39.166 --> 05:42.166
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.500
Let me just take a little slurp.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.250
Yeah. There you go.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.541
Oh!

05:47.541 --> 05:49.750
Hey, this does taste yumm--

05:52.000 --> 05:55.375
- What the fuck?
- Wakey wakey, Madame Sleepyhead.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.291
Maury, what the hell did you do?

05:57.291 --> 06:00.583
I gave you a super spready-tucky,

06:00.583 --> 06:02.125
just the way you like it.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.458
This tucky is too tight!

06:04.458 --> 06:05.750
And don't be alarmed,

06:05.750 --> 06:09.291
but he also seems to have dressed you up
like <i>Toddlers and Tiaras?</i>

06:09.291 --> 06:13.208
Ahh! I look like
Designing Woman Delta Burke.

06:13.208 --> 06:15.666
Yeah, I did you up pretty.
Don't you like it?

06:15.666 --> 06:18.250
- Ugh, that's disturbing.
- You gotta help me, germ boy.

06:18.250 --> 06:20.083
Hmm... Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

06:20.083 --> 06:22.583
I got a way to help us both. Big sneeze.

06:23.541 --> 06:25.166
What? How is that gonna--

06:26.458 --> 06:28.500
Tony, you're a genius.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.208
Oh no, Maury. Something wrong?

06:31.208 --> 06:33.875
It's just a little sniffle.
Nothing serious.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.041
No, no, no, you're getting a cold.

06:36.041 --> 06:39.333
You need to let me take care of you.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.583
Now just loosen my tucky a little,
and get into bed with me.

06:42.583 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, no. You need your tucky,
so you can rest in your place.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.250
But it's your turn to be babied, baby.

06:50.250 --> 06:53.541
Oh, fuck. Okay, yeah. Whatever you want.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.625
Kiss me, my girl, before I am sick.

06:56.625 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, sure. Whatever, Daniel Dave-Lewis.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Oh!

07:02.375 --> 07:04.791
What?

07:04.791 --> 07:06.833
I'm in a super tucky now.

07:06.833 --> 07:10.291
Connie,
I'm ready for my poison soup.

07:10.291 --> 07:12.958
Fuck that!
You're off your fuckin' rocker, Maury.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.708
And you're bad at doing makeup.

07:14.708 --> 07:18.208
You take that back.
I spent four hours on your face.

07:18.208 --> 07:20.416
I was out for four hours?!

07:20.416 --> 07:23.291
No, way longer. For a second there,
I thought you weren't gonna wake up.

07:23.291 --> 07:25.458
Fuckin' crazy-ass lunatic!

07:25.458 --> 07:30.750
Connie, wait. I had to poison you
so you would need me.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.500
Welp, guess it's just the two of us.

07:32.500 --> 07:36.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do me up nice and pretty.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.666
Are you sick, Petra?
If you're sick, you gotta go home.

07:40.666 --> 07:42.833
Relax, it's just allergies.

07:42.833 --> 07:46.000
I am not "just allergies."
That is offensive, ma'am.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.166
Well, whatever you are,

07:47.166 --> 07:50.250
I'm gonna destroy your ass
if it's the last thing I do.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.000
Oh no!

07:56.000 --> 07:58.541
Not ginseng <i>and</i> vitamin C.

07:58.541 --> 08:00.541
That's the secret combination.

08:00.541 --> 08:03.500
That's right, motherfucker!
I feel better already.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.958
Only the weak get sick.

08:04.958 --> 08:08.000
A cocky denier,
roaming free and touching things?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.041
Mwah! [chuckling] This day
just keeps getting better and better.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.208
What up, Kitty?

08:28.791 --> 08:29.875
Whoo!

08:35.125 --> 08:36.041
Uh-uh-uh!

08:36.041 --> 08:37.291
I've got shit in here

08:37.291 --> 08:39.875
you do not wanna come
face-to-face with.

08:39.875 --> 08:43.166
Oh my God! Thanks for the heads-up.

08:43.958 --> 08:46.291
Ooh, Petra, you don't look so hot.

08:46.291 --> 08:49.833
Stay away from me, girl.
I am way too busy to be sick.

08:49.833 --> 08:53.541
Oh, fuck off, Hope. You don't--

08:53.541 --> 08:54.958
You don't do shit.

08:54.958 --> 08:57.375
Whoo! My slump is over, baby!

08:57.375 --> 09:00.250
Mmm! I can taste that wife pie now.

09:01.208 --> 09:05.750
Hey, Van. I just wanna say fuck you
for getting me fired from Sarah's team.

09:06.833 --> 09:09.791
And as I'm screaming at you,
I can tell you're really sick,

09:09.791 --> 09:11.291
but I'm just gonna keep going,

09:11.291 --> 09:13.750
because I chose my tone
before I even got here.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.500
Emmy, I feel like shit. I'm going home.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.250
- But I'm worried about Sarah.
- Ugh.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.875
I mean, without me,
she's gonna shut everyone out,

09:20.875 --> 09:22.916
just like you shut everyone out.

09:22.916 --> 09:26.125
Well, I'm shutting you out right now
because you're annoying.

09:26.125 --> 09:27.791
What is the matter with you?

09:27.791 --> 09:30.208
Why are you like this?

09:30.208 --> 09:34.458
How do you get yours so square?
Yours is, like, seriously goals.

09:34.458 --> 09:38.250
Van is a fucking bitch,
and I'm fucking pissed. Hello.

09:38.250 --> 09:41.000
- Oh. Do you wanna hate on her?
- I do.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.833
Girl, you have come
to the right place. Pop off.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.083
- First, she got me fired--
- Irredeemable bitch.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.041
- Right?
- Hate her.

09:47.041 --> 09:51.041
Then I try to talk to her,
and she's, like, fully mean for no reason.

09:51.041 --> 09:54.291
- She thinks she's so cool.
- Cool? Her name is Van.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.333
Bitch, was the other option Station Wagon?

09:56.333 --> 10:01.833
She strings me along for weeks
without so much as grazing my vagina.

10:01.833 --> 10:02.750
Yikes.

10:02.750 --> 10:08.375
Also, being an alcoholic "party girl"
is not a personality. I should know.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.333
And all that drinking shows.

10:10.333 --> 10:13.916
Bitch's skin is crackin'.
Face lookin' like a suburban sidewalk.

10:13.916 --> 10:16.250
Also, someone has to say it...

10:16.250 --> 10:18.875
Drag her ass
back from whence she came, Emmy.

10:18.875 --> 10:21.125
Her forehead? Too. Big.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.000
Fuck her.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.625
Hate feels so good.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.458
I know, right? Look around.

10:28.458 --> 10:29.875
We are thriving.

10:29.875 --> 10:32.333
And, wait, none of you are even sick.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.500
<i>Ja, ja,</i> none of us are even sick.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.458
How is that even possible?
U-Upstairs, everyone is sick.

10:38.708 --> 10:40.833
- Oh, shit.
- Uh-oh.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.625
Anthony, we have another sickie.

10:46.416 --> 10:49.000
God, no. Please! Please!

10:49.000 --> 10:50.625
Uh, what is he doing?

10:50.625 --> 10:53.833
Oh, girl, that's just Anthony Piñata.
He's our office popper.

10:53.833 --> 10:56.083
"Popper"? What does that mean?

10:56.083 --> 10:59.791
Why is he squeezing him so hard?
His eyes are bulging out.

10:59.791 --> 11:01.333
I'd close your mouth if I were you.

11:02.291 --> 11:04.791
Ahh!

11:04.791 --> 11:08.375
- Tried to tell you.
- Rochelle, what the actual fuck?

11:08.375 --> 11:10.250
- Ugh!
- You were wondering why no one's sick.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.041
Anthony Piñata
just pops anyone who gets infected.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.791
Stop the spread, baby. Stop the spread.

11:14.791 --> 11:19.625
Oh, God. Can you get a cold
from brains in your mouth?

11:19.625 --> 11:22.875
- Huh, guess you can get me from brains.
- Oh, shit.

11:24.291 --> 11:25.750
Emmy, run!

11:30.250 --> 11:33.958
No! Emmy!

11:37.875 --> 11:42.166
No, Anthony Piñata, please.
I don't wanna get popped. Please!

11:45.125 --> 11:47.750
Oh, what happens when that happens?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.083
Good Lord.

11:56.375 --> 11:58.375
Oh!

11:58.375 --> 12:02.083
Wow. Anthony Piñata,
you are dedicated to your job.

12:03.666 --> 12:05.041
Eww!

12:05.041 --> 12:06.666
Jesus Christ.

12:06.666 --> 12:09.583
Every time I go to the Hate Department,
I end up covered in guts.

12:10.791 --> 12:13.083
Noodle my hole, Spaghetti Man.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.458
- <i>Bellissima!</i>
- Shit! Sorry, Mona.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.750
Hoo! Oh, right into the whoopee!

12:19.750 --> 12:21.875
I'm gonna cream soon.

12:21.875 --> 12:26.166
Yes, Pasta Daddy. Mommy's hungee.

12:26.166 --> 12:27.416
Ohh!

12:27.416 --> 12:29.083
<i>Cacio e pepe!</i>

12:34.375 --> 12:35.708
Shit. Am I sick?

12:35.708 --> 12:37.541
- Seems like it.
- Oh, this is bad.

12:37.541 --> 12:39.625
Mona, if you're sick, go home.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.250
Don't be daft, Grace. I'm a sex maniac.

12:42.250 --> 12:46.083
If I leave, I'll fuck 20 creatures sick
by the time I get home.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.291
We need the box.

12:48.291 --> 12:51.541
- Really? The fucking box?
- Uh, what's the box?

12:51.541 --> 12:54.166
You could just learn
to control yourself, Mona.

12:54.166 --> 12:57.708
Oh, fuck you! Hurry up!
I'm almost horny again.

12:57.708 --> 12:59.916
No, seriously, guys, what's the box?

13:00.875 --> 13:03.833
Um, Grace, I have to admit,
I-I'm a little scared.

13:03.833 --> 13:07.041
- Sure. You'd be crazy if you weren't.
- I'm-- I'm sorry. What?

13:07.041 --> 13:11.000
When she's gone
more than 15, 20 minutes without sex,

13:11.000 --> 13:12.500
she gets intense.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.500
- Wait, what do you mean, "intense"?
- Here's your tranq gun.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.541
If you don't think you can get her,
I would use it on yourself.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.625
You can do this.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.708
Hello, Jose.

13:22.708 --> 13:24.416
Hello, Mona.

13:24.416 --> 13:28.125
Um, I'm supposed to ask you
to put your hands behind your head...

13:28.125 --> 13:29.875
...while I slide your food in.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.000
- I don't know. Just please do it.
- Of course, darling.

13:32.833 --> 13:33.791
Ahh!

13:35.583 --> 13:37.250
Let me out, Jose.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.375
I'll make it...

13:39.291 --> 13:40.875
...worth your while.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.000
With all due respect, no, thank you.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.500
Okay, then let me out
or I'll fucking kill you.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.875
No. I'm just supposed to watch you
till your cold passes.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.416
That's my job.

13:52.416 --> 13:55.791
Fuck this. Get me out of here,
somebody, please.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.958
Ooh! Ow!

13:57.958 --> 14:01.166
- I hope you're happy, Jose.
- Oh, I'm not. I'm not happy at all.

14:01.750 --> 14:05.125
What is that? Why do you line
all your dildos up like that?

14:05.125 --> 14:07.541
- It's chess.
- Teach me.

14:07.541 --> 14:10.375
You wouldn't like it.
There's no fluid transfer.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.791
Please, Jose, it's got dildos in it.
For God's sake.

14:12.791 --> 14:15.750
I need something to distract me
from all the sex I'm not having.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.458
- I don't know.
- I'll be good, I promise.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.583
Okay, fine. I'll teach you.

14:21.583 --> 14:24.125
Oh, well, okay, we're starting right away.
So, that's a bishop.

14:24.125 --> 14:26.166
And we can only move that diagonally.

14:26.166 --> 14:30.375
It also seems to go up and down.
Up and down.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.625
You know what?
Just-- Just forget it. Forget it.

14:32.625 --> 14:35.333
No, no, I'm sorry. Please teach me.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.791
Okay. Let's continue.

14:38.791 --> 14:41.458
In chess, it's never about the next move.

14:41.458 --> 14:44.750
It's about the next six moves.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.125
This is called a pawn, and this is a rook.

14:49.708 --> 14:50.750
- No!
- Uh-uh-uh.

14:57.083 --> 14:59.666
- Good job, Mona.
- Oh, it's such a mindfuck!

15:09.166 --> 15:11.791
Look at that. Checkmate.

15:11.791 --> 15:13.708
Oh, yes.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.791
Oh, wow, Mona,

15:18.791 --> 15:21.458
you didn't pull me through the hole
and fuck me to death.

15:21.458 --> 15:27.208
I didn't. I guess I just want
to play chess with you.

15:27.208 --> 15:30.541
If you continue like this,
you... you, my dear,

15:30.541 --> 15:32.666
could be one of the greats, you know?

15:32.666 --> 15:36.250
Without sex on the brain,
I have such clarity.

15:36.250 --> 15:39.333
I can see the board in every dimension.

15:39.333 --> 15:43.041
Oh, Jose, this is sublime.

15:43.041 --> 15:45.125
Um...

15:45.125 --> 15:46.833
Well, good night, Mona.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.375
Good night, Jose.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.458
Okay, this is very touching.

15:53.791 --> 15:54.916
- Hello, darling.
- Oh.

15:54.916 --> 15:57.791
I see you're-- you're not sick anymore.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.416
No, Jose. I suppose I'm not.

16:00.416 --> 16:03.916
But you could still play chess, right?
I mean, you have a gift.

16:03.916 --> 16:07.541
Just because you can have sex now,
doesn't mean you can't play chess, right?

16:07.541 --> 16:11.041
Shh. That's exactly
what it means, you fool.

16:18.708 --> 16:21.583
Oh, what could have been.

16:23.208 --> 16:24.250
Mm.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.500
Last-minute meeting?

16:30.500 --> 16:33.791
Shit. I feel like my lungs
are full of hairy snot.

16:33.791 --> 16:35.541
But you're not gonna stop working, right?

16:35.541 --> 16:39.125
What? Of course not.
Sick days are for kindergarteners.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.458
All right. Come on, Petra.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.041
Okay, okay, here she comes.
Here she comes. Action!

16:46.041 --> 16:47.000
Wow!

16:47.000 --> 16:50.833
- What work we have.
- Work is what we are currently doing.

16:50.833 --> 16:52.291
Hmm, something is off here.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.291
Ooh, a 5-hour Energy!

16:54.291 --> 16:56.500
- Cocaine junior.
- Uh...

16:59.833 --> 17:01.958
- Wait. No, no, no! It's a trap!
- Ahh!

17:01.958 --> 17:04.708
- You sons of bitches!
- Gnaw your foot off and wriggle away.

17:04.708 --> 17:05.958
Uh-uh.

17:05.958 --> 17:10.625
Easy now, girl. We had to.
You're infecting everyone in the office.

17:10.625 --> 17:12.708
Walter, when I'm through with you,

17:12.708 --> 17:16.250
you'll be begging me
to let you kill yourself.

17:16.250 --> 17:19.833
Ahh! That was
an unnecessary escalation, Petra.

17:21.708 --> 17:27.250
"Your Brother PTH107B Label Maker
has been delivered."

17:27.250 --> 17:28.375
Oh my God!

17:28.375 --> 17:31.916
The premier label-making experience
is sitting on my doorstep.

17:31.916 --> 17:33.333
And a day early.

17:33.333 --> 17:36.125
Oh, what I wouldn't give
to be home right now,

17:36.125 --> 17:40.416
labeling my belongings,
organizing, categorizing...

17:40.416 --> 17:42.833
I will fuck you up
come Tuesday, Grace.

17:42.833 --> 17:46.708
You know the rules.
Anyone who's sick has to go home.

17:46.708 --> 17:50.541
Huh... Anybody who's sick has to go home.

17:50.541 --> 17:54.375
Well, I do feel a little feverish
with anticipation.

17:56.833 --> 18:00.708
Oh, rats. I seem to have come down
with the thing everybody is getting.

18:00.708 --> 18:02.666
Heading out, Pete?

18:02.666 --> 18:05.083
Oh, yes, I am very sick.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.416
Otherwise, you know, I'd stay here
because work hours are for work.

18:08.416 --> 18:12.833
Indeed. Well, do let me know
if you need a cuddle buddy.

18:12.833 --> 18:13.875
Uh, okay.

18:13.875 --> 18:14.833
I'm free!

18:14.833 --> 18:16.750
Fuck Grace forever.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.541
Goddamn you. Get off of me!

18:19.875 --> 18:22.583
Oh, dear, right in the mouth!

18:27.666 --> 18:30.041
Hello, gorgeous.

18:30.041 --> 18:34.416
I really shouldn't be here right now,
but you tempted me, didn't you?

18:34.416 --> 18:37.666
I am going to open you up nice and slow.

18:37.666 --> 18:38.791
Hoo-hoo!

18:38.791 --> 18:40.625
They packed you so tight.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.958
You're even more beautiful
than your picture.

18:43.875 --> 18:48.250
I hope you had a nice rest on my porch,
'cause I am gonna put you to work.

There must be.

19:19.416 --> 19:22.708
Why didn't you order refills,
you son of a bitch?

19:33.000 --> 19:38.958
Jackpot! OfficeMax may be closed,
but I am not gonna let my baby go hungry.

19:38.958 --> 19:42.208
- Mwah!
- Well, now I've seen it all.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.708
Uh, uh, no!
It's not what it looks like.

19:44.708 --> 19:46.750
Really, Pete? Really?

19:46.750 --> 19:49.541
Because it looks like
you lied about being sick

19:49.541 --> 19:52.375
and are now pilfering office supplies.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.500
You're right. I feel disgusting.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.708
As you should.

19:55.708 --> 19:58.666
You're a malingerer and a thief.

19:58.666 --> 20:02.583
I'm a bad Rock
and I deserve to get sick for real.

20:02.583 --> 20:05.041
- Give me your germs, Lionel.
- Really?

20:05.041 --> 20:07.291
Okay, here goes.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.666
- Mwah!
- Gah! Jesus, man!

20:08.666 --> 20:10.208
I meant give me your coffee cup.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.875
I-I just thought...

20:11.875 --> 20:14.416
You said give me your germs.
I thought you were flirting.

20:14.416 --> 20:18.125
I absolutely was not.
You workplace-harassed me.

20:18.125 --> 20:21.250
- Oh, uh, please don't tell.
- Just give me that.

20:21.250 --> 20:25.375
This is amazing.
People are asking to get me now.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.750
How you doin', Van?

20:27.750 --> 20:31.125
- 'Cause I am having one heck of a day.
- Ugh.

20:31.125 --> 20:34.125
- I feel like shit.
- Oh, because of what Emmy said to you?

20:34.125 --> 20:37.541
What? No. I-- I didn't even hear
what Emmy said to me.

20:37.541 --> 20:40.208
She said you're the queen
of shutting people out. Is that true?

20:40.208 --> 20:42.166
Ugh, just leave me alone.

20:42.166 --> 20:43.875
Hi, Van.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.083
- What the fuck?
- Oh, who's this?

20:46.083 --> 20:49.791
I'm one of her first clients.
You must have cared about me, right?

20:49.791 --> 20:52.041
Oh, are you trapped alone
with your demons?

20:52.041 --> 20:53.583
That's my favorite kind of sick.

20:53.583 --> 20:56.083
Both of you, just fuck off.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.708
- Hey, Van.
- Ah! Jesus!

20:57.708 --> 20:59.875
God, we had so much fun together

20:59.875 --> 21:02.041
till I went blind and died
from drinking bad moonshine.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.250
Why are you guys here?

21:03.250 --> 21:06.208
I thought you cared about me.
Did you not care about me either?

21:06.208 --> 21:09.708
No, you're just a client.
I've had, like, a million clients.

21:09.708 --> 21:11.708
Was I just a client to you?

21:11.708 --> 21:14.708
- I thought we had something special.
- Stop.

21:14.708 --> 21:17.250
- Just stop it.
- You know ghosts can go through walls?

21:17.250 --> 21:18.875
Why don't you care about me?

21:18.875 --> 21:21.916
- Why don't you care about me?
- Why don't you care about any of us?

21:21.916 --> 21:24.333
Of course I care about you.
I just wish I didn't.

21:24.333 --> 21:25.541
- Why?
- Why?

21:25.541 --> 21:27.000
- Why?
- What did we do?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.916
You all died, okay? You died.

21:29.916 --> 21:32.083
And I don't wanna think about that.
You're just like--

21:32.083 --> 21:33.500
You're like fucking goldfish.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.291
You're here one day
and you're gone the next,

21:35.291 --> 21:37.875
just flushed down the toilet,
and it's awful.

21:37.875 --> 21:42.416
It's not awful. The briefness
of human life is what makes it beautiful.

21:42.416 --> 21:44.541
I don't know, man. I died young.

21:44.541 --> 21:46.166
The point is, Van,

21:46.166 --> 21:48.833
you don't need to feel bad
for the goldfish.

21:48.833 --> 21:51.166
- We're okay.
- Again, I'm pretty pissed.

21:51.166 --> 21:54.250
But it's not your fault, Van.
You don't have to be sad.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.750
I'm not sad. I'm fucking angry.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.166
I have to lose every single one of you.

21:59.166 --> 22:03.666
You just go and go and go
and leave me behind every time.

22:03.666 --> 22:05.500
Oh my God, Van.

22:05.500 --> 22:09.916
Aww. You have to live forever,
and then watch all of us die.

22:09.916 --> 22:12.333
- That must suck.
- I think we need a group hug.

22:12.333 --> 22:15.375
- No! No, no. I don't like to be hugged.
- Come on.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.291
I'm so sorry. Sh-Should I be in the hug?

22:17.291 --> 22:19.333
Get off me, all of you.

22:19.333 --> 22:22.041
Okay, you know, I'm just gonna hop in.
Maybe it's weird if I'm not.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.875
No. Stop! Ahh!

22:23.875 --> 22:26.291
I need space! I need space!

22:28.750 --> 22:32.541
Wow, Emmy was right.
You really do shut everyone out.

22:32.541 --> 22:34.708
You can't even accept a hug
in your dreams.

22:34.708 --> 22:37.333
Please, Tony, just leave me alone.

22:37.333 --> 22:39.500
Oh, okay. Sorry.

22:41.958 --> 22:44.791
My home life sucks!

22:44.791 --> 22:46.375
I miss my computer.

22:46.375 --> 22:49.375
Ah! To heck with Grace.
She can't tell you what to do.

22:49.375 --> 22:52.333
If you wanna go to the office, girl,
you go to the office, okay?

22:53.375 --> 22:55.708
What the hell's going on around here?

22:55.708 --> 22:58.916
It's only 10:45.
What a bunch of lazy assholes.

22:58.916 --> 23:01.041
Totally. Ooh, let's go lick
all their phones.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.541
What the heck is that down there?

23:03.291 --> 23:04.833
Oh, it's you.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.708
Were you going crazy
stuck at home too?

23:06.708 --> 23:09.416
God, no. Girl, I wish I could take a day.

23:09.416 --> 23:11.541
But it's a total clusterfuck
down there on Earth.

23:11.541 --> 23:12.916
Oh, you mean with the wars,

23:12.916 --> 23:15.583
and the terrifying rise
of authoritarian populism?

23:15.583 --> 23:17.791
They're also ruining the planet.

23:17.791 --> 23:18.916
They're fucked.

23:18.916 --> 23:21.916
Well, it's my job
to make them think they're not.

23:21.916 --> 23:24.416
Oof. That's a hard job.

23:24.416 --> 23:25.833
You got that right.

23:25.833 --> 23:30.166
You know, Hope, it pains me to say this,
I mean, like, seriously, but...

23:30.166 --> 23:32.458
maybe you work harder
than I give you credit for.

23:32.458 --> 23:35.000
Petra, girl, you're going soft on me.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.916
Uh, no. That's the cold talking.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.500
Wow. What a great day.

23:40.500 --> 23:43.916
Got my numbers up, made some friends,
and progressed some storylines.

23:43.916 --> 23:45.750
Oop! Time for dinner.

23:45.750 --> 23:48.166
Yahoo!

23:48.166 --> 23:50.708
Goddamn it. Right on the keyboard.

23:53.250 --> 23:54.666
Daddy's home!

23:54.666 --> 23:56.958
There he is. How was your day, sweetie?

23:56.958 --> 23:59.291
Honestly? Great. You were right.

23:59.291 --> 24:02.708
I got so many creatures sick,
and I think I taught 'em a few things.

24:02.708 --> 24:06.375
See? That's my Tony. I'm so proud of you.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.375
Dinner's almost ready, by the way.

24:08.375 --> 24:11.375
And my Dina pie's
been cooking all afternoon.

24:11.375 --> 24:14.500
I've been thinking about it
all day.

24:14.500 --> 24:17.125
- We sure are lucky, aren't we?
- You know it.

24:17.125 --> 24:22.625
Dina, I'm gonna go get cleaned up,
and then, the rest of our lives.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.250
No.

24:34.250 --> 24:37.625
No!

24:40.916 --> 24:43.166
I love you!

24:46.375 --> 24:48.041
No!

24:48.041 --> 24:52.375
Fuck you, Tony.
I hope I killed your whole fucking family.
