00:02.335 --> 00:04.970
Max, thanks for agreeing
to get in the spirit

00:04.972 --> 00:06.939
and do holiday cupcakes.

00:06.941 --> 00:09.208
So much better than
last year when you go so drunk

00:09.210 --> 00:11.377
you turned the
12 days of Christmas

00:11.379 --> 00:13.779
into the 12 steps
of Christmas.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.148
Yeah, well, I finally
gave in.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.017
Christmas is like herpes.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.518
No matter what you do,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.954
it's gonna flare up
once a year.

00:21.956 --> 00:25.324
Oh, you made
a<i> Feliz Navidad</i> cupcake.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.226
I'm<i> muy</i> proud of you.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.862
And I think we're going
to make<i> muy mucho</i> moolah

00:29.864 --> 00:32.564
when Manuel comes<i> manana.</i>

00:32.566 --> 00:34.199
You're the only person I know

00:34.201 --> 00:37.836
who seems whiter
speaking Spanish.

00:37.838 --> 00:41.206
<i>Feliz Navidad</i> for our
Spanish speaking friends.

00:41.208 --> 00:47.079
And for kids raised like me,
<i>Feliz</i> "He's-not-your-dad."

00:47.081 --> 00:50.649
And then, "Joy To The World"
for the normals,

00:50.651 --> 00:54.253
and for the hipsters,
"Joint To The World."

00:54.255 --> 00:57.523
For the kids,
"Frosty The Snowman."
- Aww.

00:57.525 --> 01:02.027
And for you,
"Frosty With No Man."

01:02.029 --> 01:07.099
Well, I didn't see Jack Frost
nipping at your nips either.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.168
Oh, here, this one's
my favorite,

01:09.170 --> 01:10.436
"Santa Claus Is Coming"--

01:10.438 --> 01:12.938
Max, stop right there.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.740
No, that was it.
He's coming.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.776

01:19.480 --> 01:24.483
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:27.987 --> 01:29.354
Earl, change please.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.190
"Earl, change please."

01:31.192 --> 01:35.594
A phrase I heard
from both my ex-wives.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.830
Wow, you have more
Christmas cards

01:37.832 --> 01:40.766
than Oscar Pistorius
had excuses.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.969
What can I say, Max?
I spread a lot of goodwill.

01:43.971 --> 01:48.607
It's also where I get
all of my shirts.

01:48.609 --> 01:52.644
Here you go.
Have a nice holiday.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.114
My two kids love
this time of year.

01:58.918 --> 02:02.754
And next Christmas,
there will be three.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.026
It's a boy.

02:08.028 --> 02:11.296
My husband was so happy when
I called him in Afghanistan.

02:17.403 --> 02:19.538
Man, this time of year
people are easier

02:19.540 --> 02:22.207
than a fat girl
in a tube top.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.976
Oh, great.
We can use this money

02:23.978 --> 02:25.644
to order more
of our cupcake t-shirts.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.280
No, we are using that
to buy people Christmas gifts.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.749
I was really looking forward
to giving someone something

02:30.751 --> 02:33.986
that wouldn't require
the follow-up penicillin shot.

02:33.988 --> 02:37.823
We need more shirts.
These are really selling.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.125
The guy at table four
said it's the perfect gift

02:40.127 --> 02:45.330
for a girl you're not in love
with, just strictly banging.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.066
He bought three.
- Well...

02:48.068 --> 02:49.468
I happen to know
for a fact

02:49.470 --> 02:51.336
that everyone here's
getting us stuff.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.438
Han came in with
a small package today

02:53.440 --> 02:57.809
and also he was carrying
a gift bag.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.545
We'll find some money
for the gifts.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.513
People aren't expecting
anything big.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.216
Happy holidays.

03:04.218 --> 03:07.986
People just got the nothing big
they were expecting.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.355
Gather, please.
I have a very special gift

03:10.357 --> 03:12.257
for all my diner employees.

03:12.259 --> 03:14.059
Health insurance?

03:14.061 --> 03:18.664
Come on, it's Christmastime,
not crazy time.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.933
It's art. It's a one of a kind
silk screen.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.601
I did it by hand.

03:22.603 --> 03:27.005
I figured that's how
you always have to do it.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.379
Han, it's the diner.
This is amazing.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.782
Open the door.
I put something behind it

03:36.784 --> 03:38.116
that reminds me
of each of you.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.685
Mine has Sophie.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.553
Mine has a saxophone.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.121
Mine has a cupcake.

03:43.123 --> 03:46.191
Mine has a chainsaw.

03:46.193 --> 03:50.195
[imitates chainsaw]

03:53.099 --> 03:55.367
Hey, everybody!

03:59.038 --> 04:01.373
Holiday shopping tip:

04:01.375 --> 04:04.476
Fill a Starbucks cup
with vodka.

04:04.478 --> 04:09.448
Also good for waitressing.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.816
Sophie, were you
Christmas shopping?

04:10.818 --> 04:12.684
<i>(Sophie)</i>
<i>Oh, you know I was!</i>

04:12.686 --> 04:15.887
Power strips!

04:15.889 --> 04:19.658
Oh good.
You got surge protectors.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.194
Wow, that's the first time
protection's

04:22.196 --> 04:24.663
ever been used
in your apartment.

04:24.665 --> 04:29.534
Well, my Christmas village
needs 75,000 watts.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.871
And that's just to work
my candy cane helicopter.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.740
Sophie's been so busy

04:34.742 --> 04:37.376
with the Polish Society
Decorating Contest.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.244
We haven't had sex
in days.

04:39.246 --> 04:43.649
Well, I got to beat my nemesis,
Felka Bobenski.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.684
She wins every year.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.820
She's like the<i> Modern Family</i>
of Christmas decorations

04:48.822 --> 04:52.224
You know who's having
a blue Christmas this year?

04:52.226 --> 04:54.860
My balls.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.000
I love this city
at the holidays.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.602
Yeah, the urine's
all frozen

05:03.604 --> 05:06.405
so you can't really
smell it.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.840
Manhattan is the best place
to buy quality Christmas gifts.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.309
We have 40 bucks.

05:10.311 --> 05:11.943
Now, where are
those duffel bags

05:11.945 --> 05:13.679
full of stolen electronics
sold for half the price

05:13.681 --> 05:15.280
by Nairobi refugees?

05:15.282 --> 05:16.915
Well, we better
find them soon

05:16.917 --> 05:18.517
or I'm going to give up
and go to Radio Shack

05:18.519 --> 05:20.485
like everyone else
who goes to Radio Shack.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.654
[gasps]
Oh my God, Max.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.123
My childhood bank.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.858
You had a childhood bank?

05:26.860 --> 05:29.161
I didn't even have
a childhood.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.997
Come on, let's go.
I stop in every few months

05:31.999 --> 05:33.465
to get caught on
the security cameras,

05:33.467 --> 05:35.200
so people will think
I'm still in the mix.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.203
Trying to get caught
on security cameras?

05:38.205 --> 05:40.839
Whoa, we are different.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.608
Yeah, we'll just go in
and while we're in here,

05:43.610 --> 05:47.979
well, I don't know,
ask for a business loan.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.015
We are not getting
a business loan!

05:50.017 --> 05:51.850
You tricked me
into coming to the city.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.120
At least knock me out and put me
in the trunk like a person.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.789
Okay, I hear you.
No loan.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.458
But can we at least
go in there

05:59.460 --> 06:01.026
so I can get a hit
off some vault fumes

06:01.028 --> 06:03.195
and a complimentary
Christmas cocoa?

06:03.197 --> 06:05.130
Yeah, I want one too.

06:05.132 --> 06:10.602
It's so cold out here my bra is
suing my nipples for assault.

06:10.604 --> 06:15.040
I'd say we ask for
$15,000.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.975
So close I almost
smelled 100.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.877
What is with you?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.479
If I wanted you to keep
lying to me,

06:20.481 --> 06:22.147
I'd date you.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.616
Max, we need more capital

06:24.618 --> 06:26.284
so we can buy
our shirts in bulk,

06:26.286 --> 06:27.652
and then,
if we work even harder,

06:27.654 --> 06:29.254
we can double our profit.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.890
Okay, we won't pass
even the credit check.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.759
According to my
Social Security number,

06:33.761 --> 06:36.762
I died in a boat explosion
years ago.

06:36.764 --> 06:39.398
This is the time
to apply.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.633
Bankers have more guilt
at Christmastime

06:41.635 --> 06:43.135
because of
<i>It's A Wonderful Life.</i>

06:43.137 --> 06:44.903
And also 'cause
they're Jewish.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.772
I'm the one
with the business degree,

06:46.774 --> 06:48.273
and you have to trust me
on this.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.075
You know what?
You're right.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.944
You're the business genius.
What do I know?

06:52.946 --> 06:54.279
Let's go get that loan.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.747
Thank you!

06:59.585 --> 07:02.387
Yeah, I should have known
that was too good to be true.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.225
Max, come on.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.994
The bank's there.
Our shirt's in here.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.562
Let's just go in, show them,
and apply for that loan.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.730
Please!
- No.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.998
Please!
- No.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.866
Please!
- No.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.368
And that right there
was a little something

07:16.370 --> 07:18.770
called "us asking
for a bank loan."

07:18.772 --> 07:20.338
Now let's go.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.940
I'm not leaving here
until you tell me

07:21.942 --> 07:23.742
what the underlying
issue is.

07:23.744 --> 07:27.012
I'm not in love
with you anymore.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.747
Max, be serious.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.348
This whole t-shirt
was your idea.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.917
What's the real problem?

07:31.919 --> 07:32.951
That's the problem.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.553
Those shirts were my idea

07:34.555 --> 07:37.456
and nothing that comes from me
is worth $15,000.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.559
Aside from that baby
I sold on E-baby.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.929
Max, I know these t-shirts
are a money-maker.

07:43.931 --> 07:47.065
Oh, I have a money-maker
and that's not it.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.034
I can prove it.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.702
Look, this is Rodney,

07:50.704 --> 07:53.638
my childhood over-priced
clothing store.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.875
If I had known we were going
on the childhood tour today,

07:56.877 --> 07:58.477
I would have worn more
comfortable shoes

07:58.479 --> 08:00.312
and stayed home.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.547
See the shirt
on the mannequin?

08:02.549 --> 08:04.449
At least $200.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.285
And there's no reason we can't
sell ours for just as much.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.954
I'll show you.
Follow me.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.389
Oh, okay, I will.
But not on Instagram,

08:11.391 --> 08:13.558
'cause you're
out of control.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.330
This place is fancy

08:18.332 --> 08:21.833
and I've been to the
new Port Authority in Newark.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.202
Just trust me, okay?

08:24.204 --> 08:25.670
You need to jump on
those Wang pumps

08:25.672 --> 08:28.874
or like Ben Affleck,
they will be "Gone, girl."

08:28.876 --> 08:31.910
Let me do the talking.
I speak his language.

08:31.912 --> 08:35.847
And what language is that?
Portu-gays?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.884
Hello, ladies.
Welcome to Rodney.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.352
I'm Barry.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.153
Doing a little
holiday shopping?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.556
We're not allowed
to say Christmas.

08:44.558 --> 08:47.726
As a matter of fact, we're doing
a little holiday selling.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.829
Oh, you're "selling."
- Yeah.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.364
Got it.
Molly? Coke?

08:52.366 --> 08:54.499
<i>Not that I'm interested.</i>

08:54.501 --> 08:57.135
I've been clean since
Fire Island 2010.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.838
And 2012.

08:59.840 --> 09:04.342
It must be hard to not
be high and be you.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.578
Because it's hard for me

09:06.580 --> 09:09.614
to just be near you
and not be high.

09:09.616 --> 09:12.817
Yeah, you get it, girl.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.587
Actually, we wanted to see
if you'd be interested

09:15.589 --> 09:17.789
in selling one of our
fabulous graphic t-shirts.

09:17.791 --> 09:22.694
Oh, n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n--
all sorts of "no," okay?

09:22.696 --> 09:25.096
As much as I love a fez,
a caftan, and a teenage boy,

09:25.098 --> 09:27.599
this isn't Morocco.

09:27.601 --> 09:32.370
That's a really long
and boring version of "No."

09:32.372 --> 09:37.042
It's like you just did
<i>"No! The One Woman Show."</i>

09:37.044 --> 09:38.810
Here's our t-shirt--
- Look.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.479
I'll tell you two what
I said to a young Marc Jacobs.

09:41.481 --> 09:45.550
Stop offering,
I'm off the junk.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.652
Merry Holiday.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.622
I'll show Mary
a holiday.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.023
Our shirts are just
as good as these.

09:52.025 --> 09:55.527
He just needs
to see it.

09:55.529 --> 09:58.296
Here, hold this.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.332
What are you?
American Psycho?

10:00.334 --> 10:02.500
As soon as someone
says "no" to you,

10:02.502 --> 10:05.637
you start
dismembering women.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.038
I can't get
her shirt off.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.406
Tell her she can
spend the night

10:08.408 --> 10:11.676
and you'll buy her
a waffle in the morning.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.211
Okay, hand me our shirt.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.213
I think this
is gonna be big for us.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.516
You also think
Michael Buble rocks.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.919
Oh, I have to hurry.
Barry is coming.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.153
Barry is coming.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.557
I'm guessing
mostly with strangers.

10:25.559 --> 10:29.027
Seriously?

10:29.029 --> 10:32.364
Seriously?

10:32.366 --> 10:37.335
Ser-i-ous-ly?

10:37.337 --> 10:38.603
So cute.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.106
And look on the back,
"Cream Filled."

10:41.108 --> 10:42.540
Funny.

10:42.542 --> 10:45.844
People will think
I have a personality.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.545
Barry, put this
with my other stuff.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.614
How much?
300.

10:49.616 --> 10:53.852
Forget the sober story.
That guy is high.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.453
I'll take ten.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.955
They'll make great
Hanukkah gifts

10:56.957 --> 10:59.758
for my friends
who don't hate their arms.

10:59.760 --> 11:04.195
All our shirts just got bought
by a rich dead lady.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.531
I'll need 30 more
by Friday.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.204
Yes, I'm still holding.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.473
I need to place
a rush t-shirt order.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.275
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't put me on hold again.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.610
I've been through
seven rounds of

11:18.612 --> 11:20.812
<i>Grandma Got Run Over</i>
<i>By A Reindeer.</i>

11:20.814 --> 11:24.215
And she just got
run over again.

11:24.217 --> 11:27.318
Now that we have all this
crazy gay t-shirt money,

11:27.320 --> 11:30.789
I think we should
up the prices on these gifts.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.691
So we agree,
we're getting Earl a car.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.693
Sophie is getting
the country house

11:34.695 --> 11:36.795
with the lake
she's always wanted.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.698
Max, Rodney is selling
our shirts for 300,

11:39.700 --> 11:41.566
but we only get 25
of that.

11:41.568 --> 11:44.235
And you can't buy a house
for $750.

11:44.237 --> 11:48.073
It's not Detroit.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.809
Yes, hi, hi, hi.
Finally a person.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.812
I need 50 t-shirts
by Friday.

11:53.814 --> 11:57.382
But your business card says you
guarantee next-day delivery.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.652
Oh, you can't "guarantee"
that guarantee?

12:00.654 --> 12:02.454
Okay, now Oleg.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.556
What do you get a man
who has nothing,

12:04.558 --> 12:06.725
but shows you everything?

12:06.727 --> 12:08.893
What do you mean
"Is there anything else

12:08.895 --> 12:13.331
you can help me with?"
When did you help me at all?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.734
And I'm beginning to think
if Grandma works for you,

12:15.736 --> 12:17.135
she didn't get run over
by that reindeer,

12:17.137 --> 12:19.504
she threw herself
under a sleigh.

12:21.273 --> 12:25.310
So, Sophie's getting
a Snapple.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.078
Like last year.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.181
Max, we can't give up.
We can do them ourselves.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.950
We just need someone else
to do them.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.285
Come on, let's go.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.820
There are customers
who have been here

12:35.822 --> 12:38.189
since Robin Thicke
was relevant.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.192
Wait a minute, Han.
You silk-screened all those

12:41.194 --> 12:43.828
beautiful cards.
You have an artistic side.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.264
Yeah, but no backside.

12:46.266 --> 12:50.034
And a front side that shouldn't
be allowed outside.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.636
[imitates chainsaw]

12:57.276 --> 12:58.910
Why is this taking
so long?

12:58.912 --> 13:00.745
You did all those
Christmas cards.

13:00.747 --> 13:04.015
Aren't small creatures
supposed to be fast?

13:04.017 --> 13:07.619
Truth be told, those were
supposed to be ready last year.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.456
But, what was the rush?
You two weren't going anywhere.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.258
Han, just a simple
"Yes" or "No".

13:13.260 --> 13:14.526
No judgment.

13:14.528 --> 13:17.862
Have you had sex
with this machine?

13:17.864 --> 13:19.864
The only thing worse than
you two working for me

13:19.866 --> 13:21.366
is me working for you.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.135
You haven't even
given me water.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.438
Water is for closers.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.209
By "closers," I mean people
who actually make clothes.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.710
[knock on door]

13:32.712 --> 13:34.245
Who's that?

13:34.247 --> 13:38.950
Han, did you call
Child Protective Service on us?

13:38.952 --> 13:42.053
'Cause those bruises
could be from anyone.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.455
Han, you've only made
one shirt in two hours.

13:44.457 --> 13:48.126
And it's a masterpiece.
Do you want one<i> Citizen Kane</i>

13:48.128 --> 13:51.396
or 30<i> Here Comes</i>
<i>the Booms?</i>

13:51.398 --> 13:53.965
Guys, I need your help.

13:53.967 --> 13:57.035
Sophie's right behind me
and needs some cheering up.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.736
I haven't seen her
this depressed

13:58.738 --> 14:01.573
since she woke up
mid-coitus last night.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.977
Hi.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.979
Hi.
Hi, girls.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.214
Merry Christmas.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.082
Quick question:

14:11.084 --> 14:13.918
if I were to turn on that oven
and close all the windows,

14:13.920 --> 14:15.653
would I die?

14:15.655 --> 14:17.155
Nope.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.823
Otherwise I wouldn't be
standing here

14:18.825 --> 14:21.993
next to
Kim Jong-Only-Done-One.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.195
Sophie, what's the problem?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.597
Tell Han while he gets
back to work.

14:25.599 --> 14:27.165
And Han, pick up the pace

14:27.167 --> 14:29.434
or I'm going to start
the pinching again.

14:29.436 --> 14:33.838
I'm gonna lose the
Christmas decorating contest.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.742
Oh, I have nothing
to live for.

14:37.744 --> 14:43.081
Oh, Caroline, this is probably
how you feel every day.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.550
Sophie's competition
made a live-action

14:45.552 --> 14:48.853
North Pole workshop
in front of her house.

14:48.855 --> 14:52.624
Well, all I got upstairs
is a light-up nativity

14:52.626 --> 14:57.929
and $25,000 worth of
Target Christmas decorations.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.265
She blew five fuses
last night.

15:00.267 --> 15:04.602
I never thought
I'd be jealous of a fuse.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.704
Sophie, we really can't
get into this now.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.373
We are way behind
with these t-shirts.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.141
And these t-shirts are
a once in a lifetime

15:10.143 --> 15:13.811
Ow!
- chance for us to go to
a new place with our business.

15:13.813 --> 15:17.148
Oh yeah,
I hear you, girls.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.117
I mean, what am I doing here
sitting worrying about

15:19.119 --> 15:20.485
some silly contest?

15:20.487 --> 15:22.153
It's Christmas.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.222
Come on everybody.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.890
We should all be
helping the girls.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.726
Really?
that would be so amazing.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.996
Sure! And you wouldn't even
have to pay me back

15:31.998 --> 15:34.499
by letting me use your barn and
your horse tomorrow night

15:34.501 --> 15:37.135
for a live nativity scene, which
you would all have to be in.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.636
Or something like that.

15:41.540 --> 15:44.976
I think we just had
a seasonal shake-down.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.318
Han's doing the last one.
We're gonna make it.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.321
I can't believe you're in such
a good mood with that beard.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.256
Last week when you found
those two chin hairs,

15:58.258 --> 15:59.724
you weren't so chipper.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.393
I'm just so happy
I have new clothes.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.295
Okay, final shirt.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.931
Then I get you two
out of my angel hair.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.766
Han, you know,
if it weren't for you,

16:08.768 --> 16:10.468
we would have never
gotten this done.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.570
You really are
a little angel.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.505
Yeah, you are.
But I'm still surprised

16:14.507 --> 16:17.442
you weren't cast
as the baby.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.510
Oh, I was asked,
but I declined.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.779
I spent ten year
getting out of diapers.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.983
I'm not getting
back in.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.952
Han, for your Christmas gift,

16:27.954 --> 16:30.321
I'll pretend
I never heard that.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.824
Places everybody.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.493
The judges are coming.
I'm ready.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.162
Joseph's ready.
Cabbage Patch Christ is ready.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.931
Come on!

16:39.933 --> 16:42.000
What's with the cleavage?

16:42.002 --> 16:43.267
I know.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.336
She's like
the Not-So-Virgin Mary.

16:48.273 --> 16:51.909
Angel, Shepherd,
Lady with the beard,

16:51.911 --> 16:53.611
come on,
get in the stable.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.046
Stable?

16:55.048 --> 16:58.282
The way we look
it should be an "unstable."

16:58.284 --> 17:00.918
- Everybody ready?
I'm going to open the barn door.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.353
Okay.
- Yeah, I think
your barn door's

17:02.355 --> 17:04.288
already a little open.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.592
Okay now,
who am I again?

17:07.594 --> 17:09.794
Voltron?

17:09.796 --> 17:11.562
I'm not gonna lie.
One of the wise men

17:11.564 --> 17:15.633
might have smoked
some "myrrh-ijuana."

17:15.635 --> 17:17.769
That was a very nice
Christmas gift, Max.

17:17.771 --> 17:20.405
Thanks, Earl.
By the way, Sophie,

17:20.407 --> 17:21.773
the barn and us
dressed like idiots?

17:21.775 --> 17:24.275
That's your
Christmas gift.
- Oh.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.877
Oh, and hey,
bang Oleg later.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.545
Oleg,
that's your gift.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.380
How did you know?

17:29.382 --> 17:32.383
Before they come in, let's just
take a moment to look around

17:32.385 --> 17:35.720
and really let in
the true spirit of Christmas.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.456
I don't remember
writing you a monologue.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.392
Shut up!
Get your ass over by the horse.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.996
Come on, Han.
Hit the music.

17:44.998 --> 17:47.331
[Christmas music playing]
All right, everybody,

17:47.333 --> 17:49.567
look holy.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.403
Best I can do
is my underwear.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.180
all: Ooh!

18:02.182 --> 18:04.148
O h , crap!

18:04.150 --> 18:07.151
Oh, that's right, Felka.

18:07.153 --> 18:10.421
I'm the freakin'
mother of God.

18:12.691 --> 18:15.393
[chuckles]
We won!

18:15.395 --> 18:17.595
I'm so happy we won.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.531
We won! We Won!

18:20.533 --> 18:23.901
Okay, show's over.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.871
Dump the kid,
I'll be upstairs.

18:26.873 --> 18:30.575
Max, take care of
Cabbage Patch Christ.

18:30.577 --> 18:35.113
Here, Han.
You got a buddy your own size.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.619
Thank you so much,
Barry.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.421
And remember, I want
50 more shirts

18:43.423 --> 18:46.290
after the first of the year
after I'm back from rehab.

18:46.292 --> 18:50.928
'Cause ladies, I am planning
a very white Christmas.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.463
Max, this is amazing!

18:52.465 --> 18:54.499
Do you know what just
happened in there?

18:54.501 --> 18:58.503
Yeah, I stole some dope-ass
fingerless gloves.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.538
We're in business
with them now.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.706
You have to bring
those back.

19:01.708 --> 19:05.276
I got them for you.
- Okay.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.278
This is like
a Christmas miracle.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.547
Our shirts are being sold
in the most exclusive

19:09.549 --> 19:13.117
bitchy boutique in Manhattan
and they want more, lots more.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.719
Hey, let's go into your
childhood bank.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.387
I need to take
an adult pee.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.523
Okay, but this isn't home,
so remember,

19:18.525 --> 19:20.324
put the seat down
when you're done.

19:20.326 --> 19:25.296
And while we're in there,
we can apply for that loan.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.631
No, no, no, no, no.
We can't.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.865
Now I'm afraid.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.400
Come on,
what's the real issue here?

19:29.402 --> 19:31.469
We just had this
amazing success.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.571
And it looks like things
are going our way,

19:33.573 --> 19:35.006
and if we go in there,
it could all be ruined.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.241
You know what would ruin
our lives even more?

19:37.243 --> 19:40.411
If we don't get that loan
and have to spend hours

19:40.413 --> 19:43.581
with Han standing under us
trying to finish those shirts.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.650
Well, that's a real
"Nightmare Before Christmas."

19:45.652 --> 19:47.919
Let's go.
- Good, cause I'm
starting to pee a little.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.494
He gave us a loan!

19:56.496 --> 19:59.430
Is everyone who works
on the street high?

19:59.432 --> 20:02.867
I can't believe it.
It didn't go bad.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.169
I'm getting everything
I want.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.671
Walk on the outside
of the sidewalk.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.039
I'm gonna get hit
by a bus.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.107
I mean, how could he
give us a loan?

20:10.109 --> 20:12.443
I didn't even have to
flash my boobs.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.079
Then why did you
do it?

20:15.081 --> 20:17.114
I don't know.
They were making it rain.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.349
I felt obliged.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.284
Max, do you have
a dollar?

20:20.286 --> 20:23.354
I don't know.
Do you have change for 10,000?

20:23.356 --> 20:25.957
Yeah, here. For what?
For those less fortunate

20:25.959 --> 20:28.259
Anne Hathaway's here?

20:28.261 --> 20:33.130
[bell ringing]

20:33.132 --> 20:35.733
Oh, my God.
Look! Look!

20:35.735 --> 20:38.202
Whoa, no way!
No way!

20:38.204 --> 20:40.771
Max, I have chills.

20:40.773 --> 20:44.141
Well, it is snowing and there's
no fingers on those gloves.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.776
I love these.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.211
I'm sorry I didn't
get you anything.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.879
I'm just not a thief.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.282
What do you mean
you didn't get me anything?

20:51.284 --> 20:53.217
You got me everything.
Look.

20:53.219 --> 20:58.556
[bell ringing]

20:58.558 --> 21:01.559
[Christmas music playing]
