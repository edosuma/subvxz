So it's not straight A's, but...

42:59.709 --> 43:01.459
considering, you know,
he's had a transition

43:01.542 --> 43:04.292
to several different schools,
and he's learning the language,

43:04.375 --> 43:06.334
-and learning the culture.
-OMAR: Right.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.542

of the more advanced

43:08.626 --> 43:10.000

for the ninth grade.

43:10.083 --> 43:12.375
And he was the one
that wanted to take that class.

43:12.459 --> 43:13.918
-Okay.
-And so, I think

43:14.000 --> 43:17.083
he pushed himself to do it
and I admire him for doing that.

43:17.626 --> 43:18.667
This is good.

43:18.751 --> 43:21.500

to just kind of be

43:21.584 --> 43:23.876
the best of the best,
even though I wish.

43:23.959 --> 43:29.459

he knows that you, um...

I don't know that--
I don't know if it's pressure,

43:36.209 --> 43:38.626
but he knows that he needs
to be successful.

43:38.709 --> 43:39.834
Like, he knows that.

43:39.918 --> 43:41.626
That's important to you
and that he wants

43:41.709 --> 43:43.167

it would be premature

57:06.876 --> 57:08.209

in Canada than here.

as we finish here

57:15.751 --> 57:16.792
