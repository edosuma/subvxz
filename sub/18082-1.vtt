02:56.640 --> 03:01.880
India! India! India! India!

03:02.680 --> 03:07.880
India! India! India! India!

03:09.040 --> 03:14.240
India! India! India! India!

03:15.240 --> 03:18.120
'And now a quick recap
of the two dismissals.'

03:18.440 --> 03:20.800
'Sehwag leg before to Malinga.'

03:21.080 --> 03:23.600
'Caught right plum
in front of the wickets.'

03:25.840 --> 03:29.640
'And Sachin Tendulkar caught
behind off a very thick edge.'

03:30.560 --> 03:32.200
'Muttiah Muralitharan!'

03:32.240 --> 03:34.320
'The Wizard of the Emerald Isle'

03:34.360 --> 03:36.360
'being introduced
into the attack!'

03:57.400 --> 03:58.880
Excuse me, Gary.
- Yes.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.000
If a wicket goes down,
I think I should go in.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.880
But Yuvi is padded up
and ready.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.080
No, it's Murali.
I think I should go in.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.560
You sure?
- Yes.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.160
Just tell him, I'll.. I'll go.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.800
'Go, go, go, go, go!'

04:17.920 --> 04:20.279
'Has to hurry,
chance of a run out!'

04:20.600 --> 04:22.320
'Gambhir survives!'

04:39.360 --> 04:40.640
'Catch it!'

04:40.880 --> 04:43.400
'That's a stunning catch!
Kohli has to depart!'

04:43.480 --> 04:45.760
'India now in a..'

05:17.880 --> 05:20.160
Go Dhoni!

05:20.560 --> 05:24.360
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

05:24.440 --> 05:28.280
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

05:28.360 --> 05:32.240
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

05:32.320 --> 05:36.240
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

05:36.320 --> 05:40.160
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

05:40.240 --> 05:43.200
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

06:17.600 --> 06:18.720
Pan Singh Dhoni?

06:21.040 --> 06:22.920
Congratulations, it's a boy.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.080
Mr. Ghosh.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.720
Congratulations, it's a girl.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.120
Thank you.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.520
Rascals, you have a sister.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.480
Both are okay, Dhoni.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.200
Mother and daughter.

06:37.880 --> 06:41.720
But Doctor,
the nurse just said

06:41.920 --> 06:42.960
it's a boy.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.320
Huh! Did she say boy?
- Yes.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.280
Just a minute.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.920
What did Pan Singh Dhoni have?
- A boy.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.440
And Ghosh?
- Girl.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.360
Oh!

07:01.480 --> 07:03.720
You're right. It's a boy.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.960
And Mr. Ghosh, congratulations
for the baby girl.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.560
Okay?

07:12.560 --> 07:13.640
Unbelievable.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.160
If they continue like this someday
the babies will get exchanged!

07:22.640 --> 07:23.840
Mr. Dhoni.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.440
Just don't argue with him.
- Okay, sir.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.040
Just listen to what
he says and say yes.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.640
Right, sir. - Actually,
Mr. Deval is rarely wrong.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.440
He has played for Ranji.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.240
And he was also the Vice-President

07:49.280 --> 07:50.880
of the Bihar Cricket Association.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.320
Understood?
- Yes, sir.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.440
Pause here.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.400
Who commissioned this AV, Roy?

08:07.440 --> 08:09.720
Mr. Sinha did.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.280
There's something I must
tell him over the phone.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.360
Remind me later.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.520
Yes, sir.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.760
Rakesh, we're in the 90s now.
- Right, sir.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.600
Change the sitar music
in the background.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.840
Yes, sir.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.520
And reshoot the ground
footage in three months.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.040
Is there anything wrong
with the ground footage?

08:33.120 --> 08:34.559
You call this a ground!

08:35.240 --> 08:36.679
Is this where you want
our children to practice

08:36.720 --> 08:38.480
and compete with kids
from other states?

08:38.880 --> 08:41.200
Reshoot this ground
in three months.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.480
We're putting in
a turf wicket here.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.760
I'm going to completely
revamp this stadium.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.400
Sir, may I ask you something,
if you don't mind?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.400
Why aren't Bihar's players
regulars in the national team?

08:52.440 --> 08:53.840
Isn't that what you want to ask?

08:53.880 --> 08:54.920
Yes, sir.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.520
We love politics more
than cricket. Get it?

08:59.160 --> 09:00.280
See you.
- Yes.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.680
Budhia.
- Yes, sir.

09:07.720 --> 09:08.960
Why haven't you
watered the ground yet?

09:09.080 --> 09:11.360
The pump operator, Pan Singh,
is refusing.

09:12.520 --> 09:13.480
What do you mean
by he's refusing?

09:13.520 --> 09:15.240
He's saying
that there's no water.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.720
Get him here.
- Yes, sir.

09:21.560 --> 09:25.240
What's going on?
- Don't worry, sir.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.280
Pan Singh, Mr. Deval is
calling you to the ground.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.120
What happened now?

09:38.880 --> 09:40.840
Be strict with these people.
- Yes, sir.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.400
Do you see
the condition of the ground?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.720
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.360
Why haven't you
watered the ground yet?

09:46.480 --> 09:49.800
Sir, right now the water is being
supplied to the family quarters.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.560
I'll water the ground
if there's any left.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.920
What's the problem
in doing it now?

09:54.240 --> 09:56.000
If the family quarters
don't get enough

09:56.400 --> 09:58.040
I'll have to answer to them.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.200
And what about the stadium?

10:01.640 --> 10:02.920
If the families need to eat

10:02.960 --> 10:05.520
the children also need to play.
- Yes, sir.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.200
Do you expect the
children to play on this?

10:08.360 --> 10:11.120
You're right, sir.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.720
Then water the ground right now.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.120
Sir,
it'll be wrong to do it now.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.040
I have a suggestion.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.440
I'll water the field
at night after 11.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.880
That will solve everyone's problems.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.240
What time do you sleep?

10:24.480 --> 10:25.960
Currently I'm in the morning shift.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.880
So I sleep by 9 p.m.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.440
Can you sleep at 9 p.m.
and wake up at 11 p.m. again?

10:30.520 --> 10:32.160
Yes, don't worry about that.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.720
Goodbye, sir.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.040
What do you mean he won't play?

10:45.240 --> 10:46.120
Try to understand, Mrs. Shukla.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.240
The match is just three days away

10:47.280 --> 10:49.040
and now you're saying he won't play.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.720
If he doesn't play, who's
going to do the wicket-keeping?

10:50.760 --> 10:52.680
His father is getting furious.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.120
His board exams are
just around the corner.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.160
If he wastes his time playing cricket

10:56.200 --> 10:57.560
then when will he study?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.160
But the exams start
after two months.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.320
Exactly my point,
only two months are left.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.560
Wicket-keeping won't
do him any good.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.600
And if his percentage
drops even by a notch

11:07.640 --> 11:09.920
his father will create a ruckus.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.360
Look,
your son plays really well.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.960
You're ruining his life
for a few marks.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.520
Let him play,
he'll make it really big someday.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.560
How big?

11:17.600 --> 11:20.720
At the most he'll go
from Ranchi to Jamshedpur.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.840
No, Mr. Banerjee,
please spare him.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.160
His father wants to
make him a lawyer.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.760
He wants to send him to Kolkata.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.400
Come, Pintu. Come on.
- Mrs. Shukla.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.040
Listen to me!

11:34.160 --> 11:35.480
His present is still uncertain

11:35.600 --> 11:37.160
and she wants to shape his future.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.920
Chittu, come here.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.160
Yes, sir?

12:10.800 --> 12:13.320
Who's that boy?
- Goalkeeper? - Yes.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.080
That's Mahi. He's my classmate.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.800
Look, don't tell him I asked.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.720
Ask him if he's interested
in playing cricket.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.400
What did he say?

12:42.480 --> 12:45.680
He said, 'Are you mad?
Who wants to play with a tiny ball?'

12:52.200 --> 12:53.520
Come..

12:53.840 --> 12:54.960
Come.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.200
Come..

13:07.200 --> 13:09.760
Jayanti,
tell Mahi to do his homework!

13:10.880 --> 13:13.240
Mahi, do your homework!

13:13.920 --> 13:15.400
Just five more minutes.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.800
Come.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.200
Mahi, dad is home!

13:34.240 --> 13:37.440
'...the world of architecture.
Architecture..'

13:37.520 --> 13:40.880
'The Taj Mahal is one of the seven..'
- Here.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.760
'...wonders of the world..'

13:43.800 --> 13:46.960
'Which he built for his wife..'

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
They sat down to study
after they saw my cycle.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.360
Of course.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.960
Why don't you two fix
a daily routine for yourselves?

13:53.520 --> 13:55.960
2 hours for studies and
then 2 hours for playing.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.080
Mahi has already fixed
a routine for himself.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.040
2 hours for playing and then
another 2 hours for playing.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.480
Let it be, I'll deal with them.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.120
I have to go tonight.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.840
Why? Overtime again?
- No. It's a small thing.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.360
You haven't been
well the past two days.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.920
Let it be.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.080
I've already said that I'll do it.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.960
It's not too much work.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.640
The ground has completely
dried up as well.

14:22.680 --> 14:26.880
'Monuments are built by..
Between 16th and 17th century..'

14:34.360 --> 14:35.840
Come back soon.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.080
Budhia, switch on the lights
and start the water-pump!

15:47.120 --> 15:48.240
Okay!

16:25.720 --> 16:27.000
Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.360
Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.800
Did you do your
history homework?

16:29.880 --> 16:30.920
Hey!

16:32.440 --> 16:34.480
Sir, me?
- Yes. Come here.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.040
What's your name?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.640
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.280
You're a good goalkeeper.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.000
I saw you play yesterday.
Keep it up.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.600
Thank you, sir.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.800
What other sports do you like?

16:47.080 --> 16:48.920
Badminton. Table Tennis.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.520
Would you like to play cricket?
- No, sir.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.240
No interest in cricket?

16:54.440 --> 16:55.600
Not really.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.600
Scared of playing with a hard ball?
- No, sir.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.280
The wicket-keeper trials
are after school today.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.920
Play for me.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.520
Okay, sir.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.319
Excuse me, sir.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.800
I'm not scared of playing
with the hard ball.

17:13.839 --> 17:15.079
Thank you, sir.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.720
Catch the ball!

17:25.560 --> 17:27.720
Yes, catch it.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.240
Catch it.
Yes. Don't drop it.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.160
Oh!

17:31.280 --> 17:32.560
You're completely useless

17:32.640 --> 17:35.320
in sports and studies.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.240
Let's see you catch some more.
Come on.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.520
What's your problem?
Can't you see the ball?

17:44.840 --> 17:46.960
It's a red ball!
Can't you see it?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.840
You can't do anything right.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.520
Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

17:50.560 --> 17:51.960
Shabbir, give him a pair of gloves.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.520
Wear those gloves.
You come here.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.560
Now go.
Go, stand on the mark, come on.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.840
Ready?
- Yes, sir.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.120
Throw.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.360
You don't
punch the ball in cricket.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.040
You catch the ball. Understood?
- Yes, sir.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.240
Ready.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.600
Come on, throw, throw.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.680
Are you trying to
catch a ball or a fish?

18:20.840 --> 18:23.400
Catch it. No problem!

18:23.440 --> 18:25.080
Concentrate!

18:25.120 --> 18:29.720
Keep your eyes on the ball
right till the end!

18:29.760 --> 18:32.360
Very good!
Yes, that's it. Correct.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.440
Very good. Very good.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.600
Very good.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.600
That's it! That's it!

18:42.120 --> 18:43.280
Very good!

18:48.880 --> 18:50.560
Good. Very good!

18:50.600 --> 18:52.600
Come here.
Hey, stop!

18:54.440 --> 18:56.160
Would you like to do wicket-keeping
for the school team?

18:56.560 --> 18:58.240
Sir, I like to bat more than
anything in cricket.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.200
Concentrate on your
wicket-keeping first.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.440
But sir..
- I said wicket-keeping.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.880
You must practise everyday
for two hours after school. Okay?

19:10.800 --> 19:12.320
Can I keep the gloves?

19:12.920 --> 19:16.040
Keep them.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.360
Shabbir,
give him the inners as well.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.080
Take care of them.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.440
Yes, sir.
- They are school property.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.280
I'm only allowing this
as a special case.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.240
Sister!

19:29.400 --> 19:30.840
Sister!
- What?

19:30.920 --> 19:33.480
Look.
- What is that?

19:33.560 --> 19:34.840
Wicket-keeping gloves.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.240
I've been selected
for the school team.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.080
All play and no work
will ruin your life.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.840
All work and no play
will help you succeed.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.520
All work and no
play will ruin my life.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.000
All play and no work
will make me succeed.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.160
Mahi, wait!

19:47.240 --> 19:48.360
Mahi!

19:53.920 --> 19:57.280
Mom,
Mahi wants to say something.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.560
Tell her.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.320
What is it, Mahi?

20:00.400 --> 20:04.040
Mom, I've been selected
for the school's cricket team.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.440
So?

20:05.960 --> 20:08.720
So, I have to practise for
2 hours every day after school.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.920
And your studies?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.360
I'll do it when I come back.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.400
Honestly.
Just talk to dad.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.440
Please, Mom.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.160
And his studies?
- He'll do it after he comes back.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.800
What do you mean by he'll do it?
- He'll manage.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.720
His heart is set on it.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.280
Come here.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.400
Yes, Dad.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.120
When did you catch
this cricket fever?

20:37.320 --> 20:38.640
Today.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.600
Fine, but don't let
it affect your studies.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.200
Not even a bit.
- Yes.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.600
What am I?

20:50.760 --> 20:54.480
What do I do?
- You're a pump operator.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.320
That's why I keep insisting
that you study.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.480
Don't be like me.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.280
Sports has its own importance.

21:04.720 --> 21:08.120
But only if you study hard
will you be successful.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.400
Understand?

21:13.600 --> 21:14.800
Yes.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.360
Go.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.800
It's so hard to get
a government job these days.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.960
"Smear 'Malai' on the face
of the sun."

21:27.000 --> 21:30.040
"Ride the foolish clouds."

21:32.480 --> 21:36.240
"Smear 'Malai' on the face
of the sun."

21:36.280 --> 21:39.120
"Ride the foolish clouds."

21:39.160 --> 21:42.440
"We open our books to study"

21:42.520 --> 21:45.520
"and they teach us
about the Panipat War."

21:45.560 --> 21:48.720
"Listen to your heart
and be a brave-heart."

21:48.760 --> 21:51.480
"Fear will get you nothing."

21:51.600 --> 21:54.280
"All work and no play
will help you succeed."

21:54.320 --> 21:57.880
"All play and no work
will ruin your life."

21:57.920 --> 22:00.440
"All work and no play
will ruin your life."

22:00.480 --> 22:04.000
"All play and no work
will make you succeed."

22:18.320 --> 22:19.440
How much is that for?

22:19.760 --> 22:21.040
Rs. 400 for that one.
- Oh, no!

22:21.080 --> 22:22.880
And this one?
- Rs. 200.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.040
Fine, how much for this one?
- Rs. 80.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.800
Hurry up,
I'm getting late for practice.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.000
Who told you to schedule
the practice on Sunday?

22:29.080 --> 22:31.680
Yes
- Fine, final price is 60.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.240
I won't pay more than 50.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.360
He won't give it.
Let's go, let's go.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.320
50 isn't possible.
- Okay, fine.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.720
Ma'am..

22:38.960 --> 22:40.560
Good shot! Who's next?

22:43.440 --> 22:45.360
What are you doing?
You're bowling so short.

22:45.760 --> 22:47.000
Come on, Sanjay.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.880
Good ball, good ball. Next!

22:54.640 --> 22:56.160
Great!
- Good shot again!

22:56.240 --> 22:58.120
Next, quickly!

22:59.520 --> 23:02.080
Aakash?
- Yes, Mahi.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.120
Will you let me bat for a while?

23:04.320 --> 23:06.560
Mr. Banerjee only
makes me do wicket-keeping.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.400
What are you doing?
Bowl properly.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.520
No.. I said 50.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.280
Okay, 55 and it's yours.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.960
Oh, God!
- 50 and that's final.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.040
Just give it to her!
- Okay.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.760
Weigh it first. Come on.
- Quickly.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.080
Give him 50.
- I am, hold on.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.200
Fine?
- Fine, fine.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.560
Cut the pieces.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.200
Mahi is stretching like
he's going to whack the ball.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.040
Sanjay, bowl him an easy ball.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.480
Whoa!

23:55.520 --> 23:57.040
Good shot, Mahi, good shot!

23:57.080 --> 24:00.080
Here's your money.
Take it.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.960
What's the hurry?

24:02.040 --> 24:04.320
You don't understand anything.
- Yes!

24:04.360 --> 24:05.720
Because you're the
only smart one!

24:05.760 --> 24:07.000
Taking me shopping during
practice hours.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.480
Wait, wait, wait.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.840
Now hurry up.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.040
Are you seated?
- Yes.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.160
Get off, get off.
Get off quickly!

24:29.240 --> 24:33.080
Be careful! - Okay.
- Godspeed!

24:44.400 --> 24:47.160
Good shot, Mahi!

25:28.640 --> 25:31.040
Hello, Mr. Pan Singh.
- Hello. Hello.

25:32.240 --> 25:36.440
Let's buy some bangles.
- Yes, sure.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.360
Mom, Mom.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.880
Mom, listen.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.120
Huh?

25:50.320 --> 25:51.720
What?
- Mom..

25:52.120 --> 25:54.080
Mom.
Can I buy that?

25:54.120 --> 25:56.960
Lord Hanuman?
- No, the one next to that.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.960
Which God is that?

26:00.000 --> 26:01.800
And that's a strange
crown he's wearing.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.240
What will you do with that?

26:03.640 --> 26:05.240
Mom,
just buy that for me please.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.760
Look, he has hung Sachin's
poster on the wall.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.480
Why did you buy it?

26:23.600 --> 26:24.840
What could I do?

26:25.600 --> 26:29.360
I saw his expression
and I couldn't say no.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.760
Don't think too much.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.440
You know what happens
to sportsmen, don't you?

26:38.280 --> 26:40.440
I know he likes to play, but..

26:42.040 --> 26:45.080
All I want is for him to
study and get a decent job.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.920
Is that all?
Will that make you happy?

26:48.960 --> 26:50.440
Yes, it will.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.640
What if Mahi isn't happy with that?

26:55.800 --> 26:56.920
What do you mean?

26:58.040 --> 27:01.440
I watch him

27:01.840 --> 27:03.640
and kids his age.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.040
My heart says

27:07.880 --> 27:09.960
that he is not going to stop
at these small milestones.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.640
Just wait and watch.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.960
From the bus stand end,
right arm over the wicket.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.120
And that's.. That's a miss!
- Oh, no!

27:22.280 --> 27:23.840
That was a really good ball.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.320
Hey..
- Straight to the keeper's hand.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.080
It's getting really hard
for DAV School to score.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.080
Prashant Sharma is
a really good bowler.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.640
In the previous match
he took three wickets

27:32.680 --> 27:33.880
and did a hat-trick.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.560
Making things difficult
for DAV School.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.600
Let's see what DAV School's
strategy is going to be.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.920
Come on. Come on!

27:41.520 --> 27:44.480
The match is
at an interesting point.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.960
DAV needs 12 runs to win,
with just 4 balls remaining

27:48.040 --> 27:49.560
and 3 wickets in hand.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.200
And now the next ball.

27:51.320 --> 27:53.160
And that's out!

27:53.200 --> 27:55.520
He's clean bowled.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.320
It seems like the match is
slipping out of DAV's hands.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.320
DAV needs 12 runs to win.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.960
There are 3 balls left

28:03.040 --> 28:04.760
and I can see a new player
coming to the ground.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.960
Careful.
- His name is Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.320
I know you won't listen.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.280
Will you score if I give you
the strike? - I'll try.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.960
Then I would rather try myself.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.960
Come on..

28:24.480 --> 28:26.480
It's going to be tough
for DAV School.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.640
Prashant Sharma is bowling
from the Khairali end.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.800
Prashant Sharma, gesturing

28:32.840 --> 28:34.320
for a change in the
fielding positions.

28:36.240 --> 28:39.360
Mahendra Singh Dhoni ready for
bowler Prashant Sharma.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.760
Bowling right hand over the wicket.

28:42.440 --> 28:44.360
And he has smashed that!

28:44.400 --> 28:46.960
The ball is soaring
through the air!

28:47.640 --> 28:49.200
Go, Mahi!

28:53.640 --> 28:55.920
The second ball from
Prashant Sharma.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.040
The viewers are waiting.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.440
This is a golden opportunity
for DAV Shyamali.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.680
Two balls to go
and six runs required.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.200
Prashant Sharma.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.560
Six!

29:08.600 --> 29:10.400
Yay!

29:11.040 --> 29:12.400
Hit towards the bus stand!

29:12.440 --> 29:16.600
With that six, DAV has stolen
the match from under their nose.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.760
The sky is clear and it's
a good a day to play cricket.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.760
DAV Shyamali
and Khairali's captains

29:27.080 --> 29:28.840
are in the middle of
the field for the toss.

29:29.640 --> 29:30.840
Heads.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.440
And DAV Shyamali has
won the toss.. - Batting.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.760
...and elected to bat first.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.320
What do you think, Mr. Tiwari?

29:39.360 --> 29:40.600
Right or wrong?

29:40.800 --> 29:43.920
Mr. Shukla, let's see
how the match plays out.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.080
Well said.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.840
This is the batting order, follow it.
- Okay.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.320
Excuse me, sir.
- What?

29:51.520 --> 29:53.480
I haven't got a chance to bat
for the last 8 matches.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.320
You'll get it today,
their bowling is really strong.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.960
With your permission,
can I open today?

29:57.240 --> 29:58.520
What?

29:58.920 --> 30:01.040
Sir, Shabbir and Anuj
open every time.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.560
Give me one chance too.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.080
Fine,
we'll see in the next match.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.920
The next match is with RPS.
- So?

30:07.280 --> 30:09.440
What's the point in
scoring against a weak team?

30:09.960 --> 30:11.720
They are both
padded up and ready.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.120
I'll talk to them, sir.
Just a minute.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.560
Hey, listen!

30:16.400 --> 30:17.360
Mr. Shukla

30:17.440 --> 30:19.960
both teams are really enthusiastic.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.800
Anything can happen in today's game.

30:22.920 --> 30:26.080
That's what I predict.
Let's see what happens.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.240
Sir, Anuj is ready.
Can Shabbir and I open?

30:28.280 --> 30:30.880
First tell me what you said to them.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.720
Mr. Banerjee!
- Yes, coming.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.120
Go.
- Thank you, sir.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.640
Listen.
- Yes, sir?

30:40.680 --> 30:43.360
Don't be in a hurry to return.
- Yes, sir.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.280
Shabbir Hussain and
Mahendra Singh Dhoni

30:47.400 --> 30:50.720
will be opening
for DAV Shyamali.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.000
Play carefully.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.240
Mr. Banerjee won't
give you a second chance.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.560
I'll take the strike,
just don't get me run out.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.600
What?

30:58.200 --> 30:59.760
Mahendra Singh Dhoni

30:59.840 --> 31:01.800
usually comes in at No. 6

31:01.840 --> 31:03.200
but is set to open today.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.800
What are your thoughts on
this Mr. Tiwari? Right or wrong?

31:05.840 --> 31:07.960
Let's see how the match plays out.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.200
First ball of the over.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.960
Shorakat Chowdhary.
Pacing towards the pitch

31:20.320 --> 31:21.960
and the first ball.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.280
And he has smashed it!

31:23.320 --> 31:26.280
Six runs!
- Brilliant!

31:26.320 --> 31:29.280
Wait a minute, I know that boy!

31:29.560 --> 31:31.640
He's a hard hitter, Mr. Shukla.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.160
He hit two straight sixes

31:34.200 --> 31:36.320
and won the last
match for his team.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.560
He's really good!

31:37.720 --> 31:39.840
How many viewers do you
see on the ground right now?

31:39.920 --> 31:41.640
Roughly 15-16 people.
Why are you asking?

31:41.720 --> 31:43.800
Mr. Shukla,
let this boy play for an hour.

31:43.880 --> 31:46.720
And you'll see a different
scenario altogether.

31:51.960 --> 31:54.360
That's superb!
- Beautiful shot!

31:57.360 --> 31:59.760
Six runs!
- Great shot!

32:09.200 --> 32:12.560
Mahi is smashing the ball.
- What do you mean?

32:12.600 --> 32:13.640
How many wickets did we lose?

32:13.720 --> 32:15.040
He has opened the innings today.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.280
Girish, look after the shop.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.680
The next bowler is ready

32:22.880 --> 32:24.560
and he has bowled to Dhoni.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.880
And Dhoni has hit that
hard for 4 runs!

32:27.920 --> 32:30.360
Awesome!
- Well done!

32:38.080 --> 32:39.560
What a player!

32:42.840 --> 32:45.560
Amazing!
And that's a 50!

32:45.600 --> 32:47.920
Amazing!
You're playing really well.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.960
Keep at it. Play carefully.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.640
Ma'am, Mahi is smashing the ball!

33:08.280 --> 33:10.840
That's great!
- That calls for a holiday. - Yes.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.480
Dhoni's batting is
spreading its magic.

33:23.680 --> 33:27.800
Children are
flocking to the ground!

33:30.080 --> 33:31.880
Yes, yes, yes!

33:39.400 --> 33:42.640
That's great!
That's Dhoni's second century!

33:44.840 --> 33:47.280
Double century for him!

33:49.160 --> 33:51.200
I'm proud of you.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.640
He has unravelled the opposition!

34:12.719 --> 34:15.400
Hello. - Hello, please
connect me to Mr. Somi.

34:15.440 --> 34:16.960
Please hold, I'll connect you.

34:22.840 --> 34:23.960
Call for you.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.679
Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Somi.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.040
Param speaking from Ranchi.

34:30.920 --> 34:34.159
Param, I gave you this
number only for emergencies.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.320
This is an emergency.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.080
Remember that boy, Dhoni?

34:37.719 --> 34:40.239
I spoke to you about
sponsoring his cricket kit.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.159
Yes, you keep calling
up regularly for him

34:43.199 --> 34:44.840
and I keep saying no.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.400
What's his name? Dhoni.

34:46.440 --> 34:47.840
Yes, that's him.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.480
You know,
he scored 213 runs in 150 balls.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.520
And in a single day.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.719
His game is getting
better day by day.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.280
I just wanted to
give you this good news.

34:55.520 --> 34:56.679
Okay, are you done?

34:56.760 --> 34:58.240
Can I hang up now?
- Yes.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.480
I'll call you again tomorrow
for the sponsorship.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.240
And I'm coming
to Jalandhar at the month's end.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.880
Goodbye.
- Don't come!

35:04.080 --> 35:05.520
Hello, Param.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.160
Lord.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.520
How much?

35:10.760 --> 35:12.200
'And now for sports news.'

35:12.760 --> 35:17.040
'India was eliminated from
the 1999 World Cup competition.'

35:17.440 --> 35:19.440
'While playing against
New Zealand in Trent Bridge'

35:19.480 --> 35:20.680
'India won the toss'

35:20.720 --> 35:22.640
'and elected to bat first.'

35:23.080 --> 35:25.120
'Ajay Jadeja made
the highest score'

35:25.160 --> 35:26.640
'of 76 runs on behalf of India.'

35:27.200 --> 35:30.280
'India made 251 runs in 50 overs.'

35:30.760 --> 35:32.440
'The New Zealand team..'

35:34.560 --> 35:36.120
Come on, Mahi, it's quite late.

35:36.760 --> 35:40.040
Chotu, I don't think this one's
going to last for too long.

35:40.280 --> 35:42.440
Why do you hit so hard?
Use it gently.

35:42.520 --> 35:45.080
I hit gently.
It's you who thinks I hit hard.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.160
Girish, close the shop.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.600
May I ride it?
- Here.

36:14.520 --> 36:18.680
Chotu,
the MRF bat which Sachin uses..

36:19.040 --> 36:20.160
How much does that cost?

36:20.200 --> 36:21.800
MRF only makes tires.

36:21.960 --> 36:25.240
Sachin has been paid to
put the MRF sticker on his bat.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.840
People pay good players

36:26.880 --> 36:28.920
to put their stickers on their bats.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.320
That's great.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.920
And Dad, everyone says
that Mahi plays really well.

36:33.960 --> 36:34.960
And if he keeps playing like this

36:35.040 --> 36:36.480
someday he will make it really big.

36:39.080 --> 36:41.080
When do his exams begin?
- Day after tomorrow.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.600
And you know, his Under-19
trials are coming up too.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.720
Just a second.

36:57.760 --> 37:00.720
How are your studies coming along?
- Just fine.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.480
My exams start day after tomorrow.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.880
Will you pass?

37:07.200 --> 37:09.320
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.520
The Office Leagues
begin day after tomorrow.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.600
Trials begin at 11 a.m. everyday.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.240
But will you appear
for your exams?

37:17.720 --> 37:19.280
The exam starts at 8 a.m.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.920
If I finish my paper by 10:30

37:21.960 --> 37:24.800
and catch the 10:45 passenger train

37:25.080 --> 37:26.640
I'll make it to the ground on time.

37:26.840 --> 37:27.920
Yes.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.800
Will you finish your 3 hour
paper in 2.5 hours?

37:33.360 --> 37:36.640
It's difficult,
but I'll get through.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.840
That must be Chittu with the notes.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.200
I'll be right back.

37:43.040 --> 37:43.880
What?

37:43.960 --> 37:47.320
Listen, listen! - Water.
- Don't worry so much.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.800
Drink some water.
- I'll drink the water

37:48.840 --> 37:50.760
but how will he finish his 3 hour
paper in 2.5 hours?

37:50.800 --> 37:52.880
Like I said,
let him do what he's doing.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.480
Leave him be.
You worry too much.

38:06.440 --> 38:11.720
"The roads run faster
than your feet can."

38:12.080 --> 38:17.200
"What you want from life
is way beyond the ordinary."

38:17.720 --> 38:23.120
"The roads run faster
than your feet can."

38:23.360 --> 38:27.960
"What you want from life
is way beyond the ordinary."

38:28.040 --> 38:33.040
"Why think too much?
Where do you want to go?"

38:33.480 --> 38:38.680
"Just go where destiny takes you."

38:38.760 --> 38:43.600
"Impatience."

38:44.400 --> 38:49.320
"Impatience."

38:49.960 --> 38:55.400
"Impatience."

38:55.680 --> 39:00.680
"Impatience."

39:01.640 --> 39:02.880
No, Param.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.920
We never sponsor any
non-established player.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.160
That's not our policy.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.680
Sir, the boy's very special.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.680
He just needs your support.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.880
Exactly, it's not
possible to support him.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.040
Goodbye.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.960
You can support
Pakistani players

39:20.040 --> 39:21.520
but not someone
from our own country.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.840
No drama, no emotional drama..
Understand?

39:28.560 --> 39:30.360
Tell me something.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.120
What's his name?
- Dhoni. - Dhoni.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.800
Is Dhoni like Tendulkar?

39:33.960 --> 39:35.320
No. Dhoni is Dhoni.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.640
All that boy needs
is an opportunity

39:36.720 --> 39:37.880
and someday
he'll make it really big.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.400
And one day you will
remember what I said.

39:39.480 --> 39:40.800
Okay,
when are you going to Ranchi?

39:40.960 --> 39:42.040
My train leaves tonight.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.640
Fine, you go on.
I'll think about it

39:43.720 --> 39:44.720
and get back to you
in two days. Okay?

39:44.800 --> 39:46.120
Then why don't I
stay back for two days?

39:46.400 --> 39:48.320
I'm sure you'll think
of doing some good.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.960
And you'll be doing
that poor boy a favour.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.440
How do you benefit from all this?

39:51.960 --> 39:53.880
Why are you advocating that boy?
What's his name?

39:53.960 --> 39:55.040
Dhoni.
- Yes, Dhoni.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.400
What's your interest in all this?

39:56.560 --> 39:57.880
I have a very big interest.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.240
Even I loved cricket.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.480
But had no talent.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.960
But this boy is really talented.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.600
If he makes it big someday

40:04.040 --> 40:06.560
it will make me feel like
I played too.

40:08.560 --> 40:13.080
"Clouds will bow down
before you"

40:14.120 --> 40:18.960
"as long as you feel this way."

40:19.720 --> 40:24.720
"Your wealth and your treasure"

40:25.520 --> 40:31.080
"are this determination
and this passion of yours."

40:32.280 --> 40:37.440
"Why stop the inevitable?"

40:37.840 --> 40:43.080
"Just go where destiny takes you."

40:43.200 --> 40:48.200
"Impatience."

40:48.720 --> 40:53.760
"Impatience."

40:54.320 --> 40:59.320
"Impatience."

40:59.960 --> 41:04.920
"Impatience."

41:05.720 --> 41:08.120
Dhoni, 2 balls and 5 runs.

41:08.840 --> 41:11.440
Good shot!
- Yay!

41:16.400 --> 41:18.760
Hello, sir. You called me.
- Yes, Pan Singh. How are you?

41:19.040 --> 41:21.720
Fine, sir. - I've heard a lot
of praise for Mahi's game.

41:21.800 --> 41:22.760
Yes.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.840
Don't worry about his career.
- Yes.

41:24.920 --> 41:27.680
Cricket will shape his career.
- By the grace of the Goddess.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.440
He has great potential.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.240
It shouldn't be wasted, that's all.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.320
What stipend is the
Steel Authority giving Mahi?

41:35.320 --> 41:36.800
Rs. 625 monthly, sir

41:36.920 --> 41:39.040
and Rs. 25 for practice as well.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.640
Will Mahi join
the Central Coal Fields?

41:42.200 --> 41:43.560
I already had a word with them.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.840
His stipend will be 1500.

41:46.520 --> 41:49.680
Mahi's stipend will be higher
than any new player's till now.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.360
It's a good team.

41:51.680 --> 41:52.960
Mahi will benefit a lot.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.920
With your support, he will.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.800
If he gets a job and
then if he becomes permanent..

41:58.920 --> 42:00.160
He's too young for that.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.840
We'll see when the time's right.

42:02.320 --> 42:06.160
You've been generous to so many.
If you consider him as well..

42:06.640 --> 42:08.720
He's like my boy.
Of course I'll look after him.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.520
Okay. - Will the Steel Authority
guys let him quit?

42:12.360 --> 42:13.480
I'll talk to them.

42:13.920 --> 42:15.040
Let me know if they don't let him.

42:15.120 --> 42:16.720
I'll make sure that
they let him quit.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.080
Get some sweets for everyone,
come on.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.600
Yes, of course.

42:22.240 --> 42:26.040
Come on..
- You're doing great.

42:26.360 --> 42:28.440
Just keep bowling like that.
I'll stand here at mid-off.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.320
It's the last ball, come on.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.080
Come on, come on!

42:39.720 --> 42:40.960
1 ball to go and 5 runs needed.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.320
Bowl at his feet,
okay? His feet.

42:43.400 --> 42:47.920
Come on. Bunty, forward.
- Come on, come on!

43:22.880 --> 43:24.400
Santosh.
- Yes.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.600
Where did you learn to
play that shot? - Liked it?

43:27.920 --> 43:29.080
I call it the 'Slap-shot'.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.560
Will you teach me?
- Will you buy Samosas for me?

43:31.680 --> 43:33.080
Of course.
- Then I'll teach you.

43:33.160 --> 43:34.480
Then tomorrow..
- Mahi!

43:34.680 --> 43:37.600
Mahi, your family has
been looking for you.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.080
See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.800
Your father has been
looking for you.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.800
What happened?
- I don't know what happened.

43:45.440 --> 43:48.080
He said, 'Pan Singh,
this is just the beginning.'

43:48.160 --> 43:49.360
I was really glad to hear that.

43:49.440 --> 43:50.680
Quiet. Quiet.
- Yes.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.440
What happened?
- Hi.

43:54.880 --> 43:55.920
Yes, Dad.

43:57.360 --> 43:59.040
You were looking for me.
- Me?

43:59.120 --> 44:00.680
Yes.
- No.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.400
This..
- This arrived today, by courier.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.600
Mom even gave Rs. 2
to the courier boy.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.640
You know, Mahi,
Mr. Deval called me today.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.640
He's asked you to join Coal Fields.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.000
1500 stipend.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.720
And he was also saying that
he'll make your job permanent.

44:42.960 --> 44:44.360
It's a joyous day today.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.560
I'll be right back, Dad.

44:48.160 --> 44:50.080
Mahi, Mahi, listen!

44:50.240 --> 44:51.560
Where are you going?

44:57.520 --> 44:59.400
Anything else? - That's all.
- Rs. 210.

45:03.160 --> 45:05.200
What's wrong?
Why are you so serious?

45:10.920 --> 45:12.320
The kit bag has arrived.

45:14.800 --> 45:15.920
Are you insane?

45:20.440 --> 45:21.640
This is just a kit bag.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.240
Just focus on your game.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.920
The Lord will take
care of the rest.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.440
And yes, I want a century
in the next match.

45:30.640 --> 45:31.640
Go on.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.640
What are you doing?

47:01.320 --> 47:03.640
You scared me. It's beer.
Do you want a sip?

47:03.760 --> 47:04.960
It gets you high.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.640
Have you lost your mind?

47:06.800 --> 47:08.480
Do you want to be
a cricketer or an addict?

47:08.960 --> 47:10.440
Mahi,
just a little doesn't matter.

47:10.480 --> 47:13.080
This is your party, right?
Just let me have some fun.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.440
Don't make me furious, Santosh.

47:14.760 --> 47:17.080
If I see you drinking again,
I won't talk to you.

47:18.200 --> 47:20.400
Mahi, don't get angry!

47:21.760 --> 47:23.760
Listen, Mahi!

47:31.560 --> 47:34.720
Welcome everyone to the
Keenan Stadium, Jamshedpur.

47:34.880 --> 47:37.400
This is the final match
of the Cooch Behar Trophy

47:37.480 --> 47:38.960
between Bihar and Punjab.

47:39.120 --> 47:42.320
Bihar's captain Vikas Kumar
and Punjab's captain

47:42.440 --> 47:44.080
the talented Yuvraj Singh,
are standing

47:44.480 --> 47:46.560
in the middle of the field
for the toss. - Heads.

47:46.680 --> 47:47.640
Batting.

47:47.720 --> 47:48.760
All the best!

47:48.960 --> 47:52.600
Bihar wins the toss
and elects to bat.

47:52.840 --> 47:53.760
What do you say, Mr. Shukla?

47:53.840 --> 47:55.040
Very good decision.

47:56.680 --> 47:58.160
You can't give away wickets.

47:59.240 --> 48:00.400
It's a four day match

48:01.400 --> 48:04.120
and you guys must bat
for at least 2 and 1/2 days.

48:05.520 --> 48:08.440
If you wish to play the Under-19
World Cup, then let me tell you

48:09.000 --> 48:10.160
that there are two people here

48:10.240 --> 48:12.120
from the All India Junior
Selection Committee.

48:12.880 --> 48:14.520
The World Cup is next month.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.120
The team will be announced
in a few days

48:17.720 --> 48:18.920
and this is your opportunity.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.760
Rattan Kumar and S. Vich
heading towards the field.

48:33.040 --> 48:34.200
And he's bowled.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.800
Wonderful shot!

48:43.000 --> 48:44.200
There's a fielder under it.

48:44.280 --> 48:45.480
And that's a catch!

48:48.880 --> 48:50.240
Come on!

48:51.440 --> 48:52.720
And that's out!

49:00.840 --> 49:03.080
Dhoni, we must save our wickets.
Play carefully.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.120
He doesn't know you too well yet.

49:11.960 --> 49:15.960
The next batsman coming up
is Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.120
The entire responsibility
lies on Dhoni now.

49:18.320 --> 49:21.040
Let's see how he performs today.

49:53.120 --> 49:55.840
Mahendra Singh Dhoni
had already judged the ball

49:55.920 --> 49:59.240
and he hit that over
Yuvraj Singh's head.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.480
You can see Yuvraj
staring him down.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.600
Dhoni's ready.

50:06.680 --> 50:08.200
Yuvraj's next ball

50:09.920 --> 50:11.360
straight to the
wicket-keeper's gloves.

50:11.680 --> 50:13.080
Mahendra Singh Dhoni
couldn't judge the ball.

50:13.160 --> 50:15.240
Yuvraj staring directly
at Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

50:15.320 --> 50:17.400
Did you notice their
attitude towards each other?

50:17.720 --> 50:19.720
And that's a fitting reply!

50:30.600 --> 50:31.680
Catch it!

50:38.040 --> 50:39.680
And with that
Dhoni completes 50 runs.

50:40.080 --> 50:42.280
50, Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

50:42.680 --> 50:43.720
Come on, guys!

50:59.520 --> 51:03.240
At the end of Day 1, Bihar's
score is 254 runs for 5 wickets.

51:04.160 --> 51:06.480
Mahendra Singh Dhoni has
scored a total of 70 runs, not out.

51:07.720 --> 51:09.880
And Ratan Kumar is
playing at 77 not out.

51:09.960 --> 51:11.080
What would you like to say,
Mr. Shukla?

51:12.200 --> 51:13.640
Just make 200 runs more tomorrow.

51:13.760 --> 51:16.480
Then we'll see who can stop you
from playing for India Under-19.

51:16.880 --> 51:19.040
You'll get selected,
you don't need to worry.

51:45.600 --> 51:46.760
What a player!

51:54.320 --> 51:56.240
The weather is really cold.

51:56.640 --> 51:57.800
The next ball of this over

51:57.920 --> 51:59.200
to Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

52:03.160 --> 52:04.080
The next ball.

52:04.160 --> 52:05.520
And he has hit that hard!

52:05.680 --> 52:07.440
The ball's straight up in the air.

52:08.120 --> 52:09.280
Sodhi's right under the ball.

52:10.480 --> 52:11.680
And that's out!

52:11.960 --> 52:13.680
Sodhi has taken a wonderful catch!

52:14.320 --> 52:16.320
Mahendra Singh Dhoni is out!

52:51.760 --> 52:53.280
When did he return?
- This morning.

52:53.800 --> 52:55.360
I see. - He didn't go home.
- Okay.

52:55.440 --> 52:58.240
He came here and threw me out.
- Oh?

52:58.280 --> 52:59.760
He has locked the door
from the inside.

53:00.080 --> 53:01.360
He always does this.

53:03.600 --> 53:04.880
Open the door!

53:07.240 --> 53:08.960
Won't you guys let me sleep?

53:09.520 --> 53:11.320
What happened?
- What happened where?

53:11.680 --> 53:12.880
What happened at the finals?

53:16.400 --> 53:18.040
You're laughing.
- Take a seat.

53:21.360 --> 53:22.720
Chittu, get some water.

53:24.360 --> 53:26.160
Will you tell me already?
- Take a seat, and I'll tell you.

53:27.320 --> 53:28.520
Don't get so..

53:30.480 --> 53:31.520
Here you go.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.560
He'll tell us after
drinking water.

53:42.960 --> 53:45.120
So, on Day 2
I got out after scoring 84 runs.

53:45.400 --> 53:47.520
The entire team got out at 357 runs.

53:47.960 --> 53:49.640
Now Punjab comes to bat.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.560
They lose their first
wicket at 60 runs.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.600
Then Yuvraj Singh comes to bat.

54:09.280 --> 54:13.200
The score at the end of Day 2,
108 for 1 wicket.

54:16.160 --> 54:17.760
Hurry up,
tell me what happened next.

54:18.120 --> 54:20.480
It's when I hurry that I mess up.
Let me tell you properly.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.680
On Day 3,
they lose only one wicket.

54:26.560 --> 54:30.600
The score at the end of Day 3
is 431 for 2 wickets.

54:31.600 --> 54:33.600
Yuvraj Singh hit a double century.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.200
He hit a lot.

54:36.440 --> 54:37.800
Broke all records.

54:38.600 --> 54:43.240
Last day, Day 4,
Punjab's total score was 839.

54:44.120 --> 54:47.440
Yuvraj's individual score was 358.

54:47.840 --> 54:50.120
One run more than the Bihar team's
entire score.

54:51.680 --> 54:53.320
We never got to play
the second innings.

54:57.080 --> 54:58.680
Do you know where we lost the match?

54:59.080 --> 55:00.160
Where?

55:07.440 --> 55:08.560
Not on the cricket ground

55:08.680 --> 55:10.480
but on the basketball
court at night.

55:11.200 --> 55:12.560
What are you blabbering?

55:16.200 --> 55:17.920
Any new movie playing?

55:19.760 --> 55:22.640
'Captain Mohammad Kaif,
R. S. Ricky'

55:22.960 --> 55:25.720
'Manish Sharma, R. S. Sodhi'

55:26.400 --> 55:29.200
'Arjun Yadav, Yuvraj Singh'

55:29.360 --> 55:32.040
'Venugopal Rao, Niraj Patel'

55:32.120 --> 55:34.920
'Wicket-keeper Ajay Ratra,
Shalabh Srivastava'

55:34.960 --> 55:37.720
'Mritunjay Tripathi,
Mihir Diwakar'

55:37.840 --> 55:40.320
'S. Vidyut and Anup Dave.'

55:42.880 --> 55:44.120
There are three more players

55:44.160 --> 55:46.640
whose selection was debated upon.

55:46.680 --> 55:48.840
But they couldn't secure
a place on this team.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.120
Opening batsman Gautam Gambhir.

55:51.720 --> 55:53.480
Wicket-keeper Amit Deshpande.

55:53.520 --> 55:56.320
And left-hand spin-bowler
Rakesh Dhurv.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.720
They didn't even
mention Mahi's name.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.960
Chotu, come here.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.680
A dozen fritters
and 1 kilo sweetmeats.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.680
I'm telling you,
this is all a set-up.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.280
Why else would Mahi
not be selected?

56:20.320 --> 56:22.160
You fool..

56:29.080 --> 56:30.960
Mister, take this.

56:31.840 --> 56:34.800
Bring all of it on a plate, it's hot.
- Okay.

56:44.160 --> 56:46.520
What happened?
Why are you all so quiet?

56:47.840 --> 56:50.320
Mahi..
- Mahi, your..

56:50.360 --> 56:52.520
I didn't get selected, I know.

56:56.280 --> 56:58.360
Look, this tournament
has made me realise

56:58.400 --> 56:59.880
that what I did wasn't enough.

56:59.960 --> 57:01.520
I must work harder.

57:01.680 --> 57:04.120
So, it's an important day
for me today.

57:04.480 --> 57:06.840
I'm giving this fritter
and sweetmeat party

57:06.960 --> 57:08.720
so I don't forget this day.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.640
Will you guys start or should
I leave? - Mahi, listen.

57:16.680 --> 57:18.600
Where are you going?
You didn't get cold drinks.

57:18.680 --> 57:19.680
First eat this.
- Let's start.

57:19.720 --> 57:20.800
I think you didn't
get enough fritters.

57:20.880 --> 57:21.960
Have some.

57:23.920 --> 57:25.320
How much for the pomfret?

57:25.400 --> 57:26.960
Rs. 80.
- That's too much.

57:27.040 --> 57:29.120
Why do you haggle so much?

57:29.160 --> 57:30.720
Just buy what you want.
- I have to.

57:30.760 --> 57:31.920
I can't pay whatever they ask for.

57:31.960 --> 57:34.640
Pack them. - Keshav! How are you?
- All good, Chanchal.

57:34.840 --> 57:37.120
Mister, weigh this. - Are you
enjoying yourself? - Yes, I am

57:37.200 --> 57:38.320
enjoying myself.

57:38.360 --> 57:42.640
Tell him to hit harder this time.
- Tell who?

57:42.880 --> 57:44.400
Dhoni, who else?

57:44.800 --> 57:47.400
I want a better performance
at the Duleep Trophy this time.

57:47.560 --> 57:50.240
Duleep Trophy?
- Don't you know? - No!

57:50.520 --> 57:52.400
He's been selected
from the East Zone.

57:52.640 --> 57:54.160
It was published
in the newspaper today.

57:54.240 --> 57:56.840
He has a match against Central
Zone day after, in Agartala.

57:56.880 --> 57:58.240
Show him today's newspaper.

57:58.280 --> 57:59.960
Give me the newspaper.
- Here.

58:04.280 --> 58:06.440
There.
- Take a look.

58:07.400 --> 58:08.880
He doesn't know.

58:09.240 --> 58:11.040
Hold this, hold this!
- What happened?

58:11.120 --> 58:13.160
You go home,
something important has come up.

58:13.200 --> 58:14.560
I'll be right back.

58:24.280 --> 58:25.480
Well, that is..
- Param!

58:25.960 --> 58:26.800
Param!

58:26.840 --> 58:29.480
Do you know Dhoni's been
selected for Duleep Trophy?

58:37.080 --> 58:38.160
Come on.

58:46.560 --> 58:47.560
What..

58:47.600 --> 58:49.200
You've been selected
for Duleep Trophy.

58:49.560 --> 58:50.640
The match is day after tomorrow.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.360
But I didn't receive any letter.

58:53.480 --> 58:55.000
It must be stuck
at some association.

58:55.200 --> 58:57.560
Didn't Mr. Deval inform you?
- No.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.080
I've all the details.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.560
You must report at Dum Dum
Airport at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

59:00.640 --> 59:02.680
But how do I get to
Kolkata tomorrow morning?

59:02.720 --> 59:04.440
We..
- Mahi, go and talk to Mr. Deval.

59:04.480 --> 59:06.120
He'll arrange something.

59:34.800 --> 59:36.280
Sir has asked you to wait.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.880
Gentlemen, let's take a break.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.320
Yes, sir.
- Right, sir.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.720
Give that to me.
- Come..

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.440
Yes, Mahi. - Sir, I've been
selected for Duleep Trophy.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.640
Really?

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.280
And the match is day after tomorrow
at Agartala

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.720
and I have to report tomorrow
at Kolkata Airport.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.200
What!
- Sir.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.200
Wait here.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.560
Have you sent a letter for Mahi?

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.440
But somebody should have
informed us.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.320
How can he report tomorrow?

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.160
But then, he will lose
one big match.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.600
Such a big competition
and you guys are so irresponsible!

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.640
Sir.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.440
The news is right.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.880
I guess your letter's
stuck at Jamshedpur.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.880
What do I do now?

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.400
There's a flight tomorrow
from Kolkata at 9 a.m.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.560
Yes, sir.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.760
You missed the chance.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.840
Sir..
- Sir, should we try by road?

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.280
If we leave now,
we'll reach by 9 a.m.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.480
Do you know the condition
of the roads?

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.240
Sir, we'll take turns to drive.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.040
No, no, you can't make it.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.680
Just arrange for a car and we'll
handle the rest. - Yes, sir.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.280
The Accounts Department
is also shut.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.680
You guys manage
something on your own.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.400
I'll reimburse your expenses later.
Okay?

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.760
Mahi, call me when you get there.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.960
Why would we come here
if we had the money for a car?

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.720
What a man!

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.720
I think he didn't forward
the letter. - Will you be quiet?

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.400
How will we arrange something
at this late hour?

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.160
Let it be.
- What's the problem, Mahi?

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.080
We'll manage now.
And get it reimbursed later.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.240
But how?
- Just go and pack your bags.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.880
We'll get the car.
- Go on, come on.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.440
You go on. - Leave..
- Come on, go and pack. Quick!

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.600
Do you guys have some money?

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.760
What?

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:07.240
You just said that you have money!

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.480
My intentions are right,
but I am short of money.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.760
And Mahi must go.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.960
We must do something.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.960
Do you have anything?
- I may have something.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.080
And you? - Yes..
- I'll take a look.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.640
I'll arrange for something
as well. - Come on.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.240
Let's meet at Deepak's garage
at 12 o'clock tonight.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.600
Okay?
- Come on. Hurry up.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.680
Let's go, let's go.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.800
Chittu, you're back home.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.920
Chittu, you're going?
- Yes, I'll be back soon.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.400
We'll pay the rest
after we come back. - Okay.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.960
Fine.
- Come on, get in, get in.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.360
He's here!

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.040
Come on, give it to me.
- Drive safely. - Bye!

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.440
Get in.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.640
Come on.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.800
Bye, Mahi.
All the best!

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.520
Param, should I drive?

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.160
Mahi, wake up.
We've reached the airport.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.080
Mahi, wake up.
We're here.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:28.240
Quickly. Quickly.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.840
We're here.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.960
Mahi, we worked really hard.
Hit a century for us.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.560
Mahi won't stop,
he'll definitely hit it. - Come on!

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.680
Of course, he will.
He'll make a century.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.400
What happened? - The flight
took off half an hour ago.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.640
Mahi..
- I'll be back in two minutes.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.040
Mahi.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.800
Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.600
You called for me, sir?
- Come in, Satyaprakash.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.640
Doesn't Mahendra Singh Dhoni
play with you?

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.680
Yes, sir.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.520
He's my junior. But plays well.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.760
Will he join Railways?

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.080
Will he become a ticket-collector?

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.440
Don't know, sir.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.960
Heard of
Bondamunda Railway Station?

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.880
Sir, I'm better off in Kharagpur.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.440
Offer him a job
on behalf of the Railways.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.440
Mahi!

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.960
Mahi!

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.480
Chittu.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.120
Mahi!

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.040
What happened?

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.600
Your dad's looking for you!

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.600
Come quickly!

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.600
What did you do this time?
- I did nothing.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.880
Maybe, that's why
he's looking for you.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.720
Brother.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.360
Your son will go very far.
- Yes. - Where were you?

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.800
Congratulations, Mr. Pan Singh.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.400
The Railways has a Sports quota.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.560
And Mr. Animesh loves cricket.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.040
He's looking for a good
wicket-keeper batsman

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.680
for the South-Eastern Railways.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.200
And he's had his eye on Mahi
for a long time.

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.240
Is his job as a TC confirmed?

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.440
Mr. Animesh will test Mahi.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.480
If he passes that,
his job's guaranteed.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.240
He will pass the test.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.960
This is great news.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.760
His first posting
will be in Kharagpur itself.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.840
After that we'll try
to relocate him to Ranchi.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.120
And with everything included

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.720
he'll get Rs. 5000 in hand
on the 1st of every month.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.200
With the Goddess' blessings,
Mahi will become a ticket-collector.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.720
What more can one ask for?

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.560
Why don't you tell dad
if you don't want to go?

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:39.640
Did you see dad's face?
- Yes.

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.479
And he'll need money too.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.600
Don't try to sound so responsible.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.399
Tell me something, Sister.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.479
Will I ever do
anything with my life?

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.600
Why not!

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.720
Wait and watch, someday you
will be very successful, Mahi.

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:04.680
Satya was saying
that if you do your job well

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.080
then you could
be the boss someday.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.880
What happened?

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.800
Should I have said something else?

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.640
I will miss all of you.
- Me too.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.279
Mr. Animesh bowls personally
to every player

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.640
before selecting him for the team.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.479
You just play well.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.640
What does he normally bowl?
- Everything.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:40.960
On his own?
- Yes.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.920
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.320
Dhoni, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.960
I've heard a lot about you.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.440
Wear your pads.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.680
Is it too fast?

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.520
Should I bowl slower?
- No, sir. It's fine.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.840
Try that again.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.800
Catch it!

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.760
Dhoni, I'm going to bowl
a bouncer next.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.960
Wear your helmet.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.200
Sir, sir!

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.360
Sir.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.640
Please get out or
he will keep bowling all day.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.760
Your job depends on it.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.560
I won't get out to get a job.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.920
Well played, good shot.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.440
Sir.
- Your bat swings are really good.

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.960
But try to hit straight.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.200
Play in the V,
mid-off and mid-on.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.880
And don't hit too many
over-the-heads.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:12.880
Yes, sir.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.720
Practice every day
after your duty hours.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.520
You practice as much as you work.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.200
Would you be able do it?
- Yes, sir.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.960
The railway trials
are in two months.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.960
You must perform well.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.120
You can join duty next week.
- Thank you, sir.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.400
Amazing.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.360
Very good.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.040
Are these the quarters?
- No, they're at the back.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.320
That is Mr. Animesh's bungalow.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.960
The one adjacent
to the boundary wall.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.760
He's made a cement pitch out there.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.120
And we stay here

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.040
so that he can call us for practice
any time he wants.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.200
Come.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.400
Come in.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.360
Can I keep this here?
- Yes.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.200
There are two rooms here.
- Yes.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.160
This one

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.040
and this one.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:24.880
Close that door.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.600
If you don't close that door,
you can't open this one.

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.640
I see.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.400
Come.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.200
This is the bathroom

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.760
and this is the kitchen.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.200
There's tea, sugar,
vegetables, everything.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.880
Every ingredient to cook a meal.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.960
Great.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.000
Come.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.760
And this is our garden.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.440
In the railways,
gardens are bigger than the rooms.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.040
We have planted trees here.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.720
Come.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.800
Always keep this door closed.
- Yes.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.560
Sometimes snakes crawl in.
- Through here?

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.560
Yes.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.960
It's nice, quite big.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.840
No, three other guys live here.
- Okay.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.320
They have their day shift,
they'll be here soon.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.840
I told Mr. Das
not to teach me all that.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.960
That was right, Deepak.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:23.960
They are here.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.080
Hey! - How's everything?
- Just great.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.480
Remember I told you about Mahi?
- Yes.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.520
This is him.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.760
Mahi, this is Robin.
- Hello.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.280
Deepak, Jayesh.
- Hello.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.400
He's too young.
How could they give him a job?

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.240
Play a match with him
and you will know. - Really?

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.800
Yes! - But where will you sleep?
- Anywhere.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.720
Doesn't matter.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.320
Eat your meal
and hit the sack early. - Okay.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.920
You should've seen how
he whacked Mr. Animesh's balls

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:45.800
all over the ground.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.200
He bowled a spinner
and he hit it for a six.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.120
Fast ball, again six.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.560
Six, six, six..

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.720
Mister, where does Mr. Sarkar sit?
- There.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.120
There?
- Yes, in the opposite room.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Just a second.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.560
Good morning, sir.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.760
Mahendra Singh Dhoni
reporting, sir.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.200
Come.
- Sir.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.640
This is your table and chair.
- Sir.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.120
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning. File this.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.080
Okay, sir.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.920
Did you take your 'picking-up duty'?
- I did yesterday.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.400
That's Mr. Das.
- Good morning, sir.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.120
And that's Mr. Singh.
- Good morning, sir.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.200
8013 UP will arrive
on Platform No. 1.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.520
It was supposed to arrive
at 8:30 a.m.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.440
but it's running late.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:41.720
Find out the arrival time.
- Sir!

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.480
You will find Ghoshal
in the TC compartment.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.520
Give him this paper

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.600
and keep whatever he gives you.
- Sir.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.120
8029 DOWN will arrive
on Platform No. 2 at 9:30 a.m.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.440
You will find Shukla there.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.880
Give him this paper

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.600
and then keep the sheet
that he gives you.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.600
Go.
- Okay, sir.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.080
8013 UP Platform No. 1, Ghoshal.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.920
8029 DOWN, No. 2,
Shukla at 9.30 a.m.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.480
Excuse me!

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.800
Move aside!

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.840
'The train will now
arrive on Platform No. 3'

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:14.320
'instead of Platform No. 1
at 9.30 a.m.'

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.240
'Your attention please.'

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.040
'8013 UP Steel Express'

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:22.560
'travelling from Tata to Howrah,
is running one hour later'

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.200
'than its expected time.'

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.920
'This train will arrive
on Platform No. 3'

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.760
'instead of Platform No. 1
at 9:30 a.m.'

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.600
'Thank you.'

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.600
Both will arrive at the same time!

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.840
'May I have your attention please!'

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.920
'8013 UP Steel Express'

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.600
'from Tata to Howrah,
is running late by one hour.'

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.640
Sir, sir.. Mr. Shukla..

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.360
Who is Shukla?
I'm Abhijeet Ghoshal.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.360
Here you go.
- Do you have the ticket?

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.280
Go and check there.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.040
This is for 8029 DOWN.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.080
Sir.
- Where do you want to go?

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.960
Sir, this one.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.440
Just a minute. I'll check.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.520
Please hurry up, the other train's
leaving. I've another copy..

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.320
Stop yelling.. - Just a minute.
- ...and let me do my work.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:13.600
I'm giving it to you.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.480
Sir, help me with my seat, please.
- Come here.

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.200
Sir, check my ticket, please.

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.440
Here you go.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.040
Move aside, please!

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.960
One second, one second.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.520
Sir, both the trains
arrived at the same time.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.040
I tried, but..
- How hard did you try?

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.920
Sir, I tried my best.
- Fine.

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.040
Train no. 465 is arriving.
- Sir.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.480
Take the fine book and go
to Gate No. 3. - Okay, sir.

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.640
All of them are repeat offenders.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.920
Fine them heavily.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.000
Okay, sir.
- Now, go.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.800
How is Dhoni doing?

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.840
He missed a train on the first day.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.080
And I already gave him
the 'Platform No. 3' experience.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.160
He's your responsibility, Sarkar.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.280
He's a special case.
- No worries, sir.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.520
But Mr. Das and Mr. Singh

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.240
are not taking his recruitment
too well.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.240
We'll see.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.960
May I ask you something, sir?

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.240
Yes.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.680
What's so special about him?

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.200
Do you still play cricket?

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.000
Sometimes, sir.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.400
Play one match with him
and you will find out.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.240
You're back, Mahi!
- Yes.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:15.280
How was your first day?
- It was a Yorker.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.080
Eat something,
we have to go and practice.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.680
Are you catching a ball or a fish?

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.280
Catch! Oh!

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:33.680
Well taken!

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.600
Very good!

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:39.440
Very nice!

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.680
Please move.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.120
Ticket!
Your ticket, please!

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.480
Come, Dilip.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.040
Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.800
Sit.
- Thank you.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.720
How are you?
- All well, sir.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.480
Did you see yesterday's match?

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.840
I did, sir.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.800
The boys have done us proud.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.920
Kaif and Yuvraj were brilliant.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.080
They were too good.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.240
John is doing everything right.

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.680
Whether Sourav should have taken
off his jersey is still debatable.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.680
Otherwise, Indian Cricket
is in good hands.

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.240
We must think about
the future as well.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.920
Of course. Of course.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.400
Last year,
Makarand Waingankar joined

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:21.200
Karnataka State Cricket Association
as a consultant.

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.800
Makarand has achieved
some fantastic results

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.880
in getting new talents
from smaller districts.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.400
Some really good players
are coming up

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.040
who are outperforming
these state-level players.

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.040
BCCI would like to do
the same thing.

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.280
We want to open TRDW

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.320
which is the
Talent Research Development Wing.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.000
And the focus
will be on B-tier towns.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.200
Sounds nice, sir.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.120
But this will only work when

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.880
this body reports
directly to the Board.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.560
If it goes through
the State Cricket Association..

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:52.920
Precisely.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:56.040
TRDW will report directly
to the board

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.920
and the players
will be sent directly

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.400
to the National Cricket Academy.

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.920
The board wants to appoint
you as the Chairman.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.720
What do you say?

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.560
Sir, I'll be honoured.
- Good.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.640
Brijesh will assist you.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.240
Think about the structure.
- Sure.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.560
Let me call a meeting next week

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.960
and let's get this going.
- Sure, sir. Sure.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:27.400
Keep that file on my table
in the morning. - Okay, sir.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.080
Dhoni. Why are you sitting here?

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:42.640
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.720
Just like that, sir.

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:44.800
Sit, sit.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.240
Sit.

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.240
Sir, my roommates
are out on duty.

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:55.480
So, whether I sit in my room
or here, it's the same thing.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.600
And what were you thinking?
- Nothing, sir.

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.320
Just like that..
Nothing important.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.040
You should open up.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.720
It lightens your heart.

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.160
Sir, I keep wondering
as to what I am doing.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.080
I'm a cricketer, but working
as a TC at Kharagpur Station.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.760
It's not that I think
the job is small.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:19.440
But I don't know
how I'll play ahead.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.120
Only I know what's going on
in my life every day.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:27.440
First I jog between
8013 UP and 8029 DOWN.

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.640
Then I stand at Gate No. 3
and collect fines.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.000
Neither my game's improving

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.160
nor am I getting any
opportunity to progress.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.720
Still playing 'Ranji'.

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.920
How long will this go on?

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.360
Sometimes I feel like quitting
everything and going back.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.920
But then I think of dad.

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.160
Every night when
I return to my room

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.200
I feel like I'm returning
to the pavilion after getting out.

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.840
You asked why I'm sitting here.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.400
This is what I keep thinking
no matter where I sit.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.640
Oh, God!
Were you thinking all that?

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:13.080
Sorry, sir..
But I'm start feeling depressed.

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.680
Well, tell me something.

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.280
What do you do when
you get bowled a full toss?

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.760
Sir?

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.440
What do you do when
you get bowled a full toss?

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.160
I hit it.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.960
And a juicy half-volley?
- Drive.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.520
If it's a good out-swinger?

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.760
Leave it.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.240
If it's a good in-swinger?

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.560
Defend. - And when you get
an unplayable bouncer?

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.560
I duck.
- That's it. That's life.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.960
Imagine that all these are bouncers
and you need to duck.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:50.440
Don't think too much.

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.960
You won't get
the same ball each time.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.640
You've to play on your merit
and stand your ground.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.000
The scoreboard will keep moving.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:01.760
Sir.

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.080
And don't worry too much
about your job.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.720
As long as I'm here, you can play

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.440
anywhere you want,
whenever you want.

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.320
I will take care of your attendance.
Don't worry.

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:15.600
Thank you, sir.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.080
Sir, may I play
the tennis tournament?

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.040
They play on 18 yards
instead of 22.

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.360
But I think it will be good for me.
- Yes, of course. Go and play.

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.800
But everyone's saying
it will ruin my game.

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:28.400
Ruin your game?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.840
Which fool says that?
- Sir..

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.840
Your game hasn't improved yet
that it will get ruined.

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.400
Your plus point is that
you're a complete natural.

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.880
Understood?
- Sir.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:38.160
Let's go.

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.360
Come on.

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.080
Don't be too serious for
absolutely no reason. Understand?

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.840
And why aren't you
cutting your hair?

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.200
I'm thinking about letting it grow.

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.400
And you must work
on your spoken English.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.360
Yes.

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.040
It will come in handy
in the future. - Yes, sir.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:57.680
"The path is studded with stones.
I don't care."

01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.920
"The guise of dreams are blurred.
I don't care."

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.200
"My heart is imploded.
Let it be."

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.640
"Now come what may,
I don't care."

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.720
"Chancily acts my heart and
recklessly does what it wants."

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.120
"Wildly beats my heart
just like a thunderbolt."

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.040
"It looks for odds in the cloud
and shares an untamed courage."

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:44.080
Just two more steps
and straight to the Indian Team.

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.640
Exactly.
- For sure! - Yes.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.440
Listen carefully, Mahi.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:50.480
First see where the selectors
are sitting. - Okay.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.200
And hit a six towards them.
- Okay.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.720
"I don't care!"
- Play well!

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.800
"I don't care!"

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.440
Next.

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.160
Mishra, next.

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.080
Where do they come from?

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.520
Look at his hair.

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.920
Yes, Mahi. How was it?

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.600
I only got three balls for keeping
and one over for batting.

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.760
Why do they call if that's
all they want you to do?

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.960
Did they treat everyone like that?

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.800
No, I guess I was the special case.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.000
"Whether it's false or true,
dreams are dreams."

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.200
"You can keep
the light of the stars."

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.400
"All the fireflies are mine."

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.160
"Wildly beats my heart,
unstoppable it is."

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.360
"My heart beats with
an untamed courage"

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.960
"stubborn is it's throbbing."

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.880
"Be it make or break!"

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.280
"I don't care!"

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.680
"I don't care!"

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.080
"I don't care!"

01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.080
"I don't care!"

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.680
This can't go on!
- He hasn't come in to work again.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:11.120
I'm worried about Mahi.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.560
He's going nowhere.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.760
He quit everything

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.680
and ran away to Dhanbad
to you for six months.

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.880
There was a huge ruckus
in the office.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.400
Mahi's game has reached
a completely different level.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.640
Do you know? He's hit
25-30 centuries in six months!

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.000
And when he's batting

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.720
it feels like he's venting his anger.
- Exactly!

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.240
He's so talented
that sometimes I fear

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:33.280
he'll do something wrong
out of frustration.

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:35.120
Let's go.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.120
Yes, everything's fine. - I tried
explaining things to him, but..

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:40.360
Travelling all over
Bihar and Jharkhand.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.880
Ask me where I haven't played!

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.200
Well, I'm in a bad mood nowadays,
so only playing football.

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.520
Okay, I'm hanging up now.
Talk to you later.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.600
Bye.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.680
How's everything, Mahi?

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:00.880
Hey!

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.600
This is exactly what
I was talking about.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.360
I think he's gone crazy.
- What happened?

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.520
The phone's not been
working since 15 days.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.200
The line's dead.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.240
The phone's dead?
- Yes.

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.600
Who was he talking to?

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.880
What will we do now?

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.880
The phone's actually dead.
- I know!

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.240
His family will say, I took him
to Kharagpur and drove him insane.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.040
Well, I feel..
- Hey!

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.120
What?
- What's this, Mahi?

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.160
What's all this?
- You got worried! - Go away!

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:41.960
W-Why are you hitting me?

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:52.880
'Shot pulled away for 4 by
Tendulkar.' - Wow! - What a shot!

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.560
Catch up! - That wasn't from
the middle of the bat.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.120
That's Sachin!
- The ball is coming slow.

01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:57.480
Wow.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.120
Great.

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.160
Wonderful, Sachin..
- 'Up in the air..'

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.320
'McGrath underneath it!'
- Oh, no!

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.040
'India lose their first wicket..'
- What the heck!

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.960
Why did you have to play that shot?
- 'Sachin Tendulkar..'

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.560
What kind of a shot was that?
- He should've asked you

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.880
before he played that shot.
- We've lost the World Cup!

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:16.640
Does anyone want tea?
- These guys will definitely lose it.

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.760
Don't say that. Please don't
say such negative things.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.160
Be quiet and stop bothering me.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:26.880
Didn't Kaif, Mongia and Yuvraj
start at the same time as Mahi?

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:27.880
Yes.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.160
All of them have
played the World Cup.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:30.960
I wonder what's going
to happen to Mahi.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.440
Can you speak a little softer?

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.080
No, sir.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.280
I understand, sir.

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.440
Excuse me, sir.
Sir.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.240
I will definitely look into it.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.880
Thank you, sir.
Bye.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.240
Sir, you called for me.

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.720
A notice has been
sent in your name.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.040
Someone's complained about you.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.080
About your attendance.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.040
Sir, the bouncers don't
seem to stop coming.

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.760
I've been ducking
for three years now. And now this.

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:16.280
Look, Mahi, the enquiry
is day after tomorrow at 10 a.m.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:18.880
Two officers are coming down
from the Head Office.

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.720
I have a suggestion.

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.960
Before they can question you

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.800
you have your defence ready..

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:32.920
Did you understand?

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.760
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.240
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:44.160
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:56.120
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:02.160
Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni! Dhoni!

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.920
Bless you.
When did you arrive?

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.480
In the evening.

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.480
All okay?
- Yes.

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:38.600
You've lost weight.
Have you been eating properly?

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.480
Yes, it's all okay.

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:43.120
I hope you will
stay longer this time.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.720
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:46.880
Yes, tell me.

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.520
I'm quitting
my job with the Railways.

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.120
I cannot handle both.

01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.000
I can either work or play cricket.

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.280
If I concentrate on cricket,
the head office sends a notice.

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:06.800
So I've decided to shift
my focus entirely on the game.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:07.960
And then we'll see.

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:09.680
I just want to play cricket now.
- And when

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:11.640
you grow old
and can't play anymore

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.800
how will you make ends meet?

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.560
You can't play cricket forever.

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.360
I will find another job,
don't worry.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:23.760
Since you've decided already,
do what you want.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.280
You don't have to tell me anything.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.720
Dad, please don't say that.

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:33.360
If I get caught up with
this security of a daily job

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:35.560
then I will never move up in life.

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.560
Just give me some time.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.640
I just want to give it
one last try.

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.160
If nothing concrete
happens in a year

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:44.000
then I will do as you say.

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.800
You shouldn't have
quit your job, Mahi.

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.240
Dad..
- No, no.

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.040
Welcome, audience.

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.680
East Zone Vs. Central Zone,
for the Deodhar Trophy.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.120
A very important match
is being played today.

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:04.840
The 'Talent Research Development
Wing' officers are sitting here.

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.560
And they will keep an eye
out for talented players.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.720
'Check where
the selectors are sitting.'

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.640
'And hit your six towards them.'

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:29.560
And the first ball of the over.

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:35.000
Oh, my God, that's a six!

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.560
Six!

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.040
Beautiful!

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.360
And he has swung his bat again.

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:49.840
Yes, Prakash.

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.120
Yes, I've heard his name.

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.120
Really?

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.360
And again!
- What a shot. Wonderful.

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:00.920
Who is that player?
- Good morning, sir.

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.360
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.480
Where is he from? - Jharkhand.
- He plays really well, sir.

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:07.880
He hits really big sixes.

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.040
He's batting really well.
- Absolutely, sir.

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.720
Very nice.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.960
Dinesh Karthik,
extremely talented.

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:19.160
Naman Ojha, he's a safe
wicket-keeper and an okay batsman.

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.840
Mahendra Singh Dhoni
and Deep Dasgupta.

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.520
Dhoni's performance in the
Deodhar Trophy was quite good.

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:28.200
He's a good batsman but his
keeping technique is very poor.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.520
But Gopal,
technique isn't everything.

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.920
If he's getting results
with his poor technique

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.480
then I don't
see a problem in that.

01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:35.840
Look, sir, in my opinion..
- One second, one second.

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:39.080
Does he have poor technique
or is he an unconventional player?

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.120
There's a difference
between the two.

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:47.760
Great shot!

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:51.120
Mahi! - You've been selected
in the India A Team!

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.600
You're in the Zimbabwe
and Kenya Tour! Yes!

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.480
Mahi, it's published in the papers.

01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.800
Come on.

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.960
Didn't you hear, Mahi?

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.320
Mahi!

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.520
We're giving him good news
and he isn't listening.

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.680
Let's go, celebrate.

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:10.280
You guys go on,
I'll finish the game and join you.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.040
He's unbelievable. We're going
to celebrate. - Yes, let's go.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.720
Mahi, one more game?
- One second.

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:45.640
I'll go now, it's time.
- Bless you.

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:47.360
And keep calling.
- Okay.

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:49.080
Take care.
- Take care and eat properly.

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.280
Mahi, your train is about to leave.

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.920
I'll call you.
- Yes, please.

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.600
We'll miss you. Take care.

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.880
Sir.. - Come on.
- All the best.

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.720
Come on, get on.

01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:59.040
The train's leaving.

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:00.760
Take care, Mahi.

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.560
Hit it out of the park!

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:05.160
Bye. Bye.
- Bye!

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.880
Play well and take care, Mahi!

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.880
Go Mahi!

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.080
The Man of the Match
and hands down..

01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.040
All the commentators..
M.S. Dhoni!

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.480
I'll request you to give away
the Man of the Match Award.

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:45.480
You seem to be in love
with this pitch.

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.240
Yes, definitely. This is
a very good wicket to bat on.

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.200
Apart from first 10 overs.

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.080
After the shine is gone, I think

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.360
it's all for the games
that are played by the batsman.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.200
Here comes Mahi!

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:02.600
There he is.
- Amazing!

01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.720
Hi!
- Why is everyone here?

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.120
How are you, Mahi?

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.840
Bless you. How are you?
- Hi, Mahi.

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.600
Sir, one photograph.
One photo.

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:17.720
Sir, a bit to the left.
Smile please, sir.

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:23.720
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.880
Dhoni.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.280
Dinesh Karthik.

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:27.800
Dhoni.

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.560
Sourav?
- Let's try Dhoni.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.520
Goodnight.
- Bye, goodnight.

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.080
India has got off to
a very slow start here.

01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:15.960
Now let's see how
the match progresses.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.960
They really need a partnership
at this point of time.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.840
Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the
debutant is coming in to bat.

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.840
India are really under
pressure at 180 for 5. - Mahi!

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:26.280
Let's see what the boy from
Ranchi can do.

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:28.000
He's an explosive
wicket-keeper - batsman.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:29.960
Mohammad Rafique
continues to bowl.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.400
Chance of a run out!
He's got him!

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.480
Mahendra Singh Dhoni!

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.160
Why did he have to run?
- What happened?

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:42.440
Kaif called for a run
and sent him back.

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.200
It's his fault. He got him out.

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.160
Chittu, enough.

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:47.040
Dhoni's just short
of his crease.

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.960
This can be a turning
point in the match.

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:50.480
What happened?
- Run out!

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.320
He's always so impatient!
Got out on the first ball.

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:56.880
How about some tea?

01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:00.120
Has to depart in his
first One Day International.

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.720
And that must be
a huge disappointment

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.400
to the very, very young,
talented man.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:10.360
Tapash Baisya bowling right-arm
over, medium pace to Dhoni.

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.840
Struggling with timing.
- No, no, no, wait, wait.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.280
It's not an easy track.
- Careful.

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.320
The ball not quite coming
on to the bat. - Hit it.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.120
Beaten again outside the off stump.
- What is this boy doing?

01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:21.680
The ball not really bouncing.
- Calm down.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:24.520
Can't he be a bit patient?

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.880
Taken at short mid-wicket.
Good sharp catch by Bangladesh.

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.720
And they would feel
that they've..

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:34.320
What's he doing?
- ...got their foot into the door

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.280
in this massive contest.

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:39.520
He only has one match now.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.160
He won't get so many opportunities.
- It's okay.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:44.520
I think that's a no-ball.
- Stop it, Chittu.

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:47.280
Catch at mid-wicket..
- How about some tea?

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:52.280
And Dhoni is gone for 12
and India are 155 for 6.

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.680
Now this has been an excellent
batting display from the Indians.

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.640
What.. What great stroke play!

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.880
Pitched up
and Dhoni climbs into it!

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:12.480
That's huge! It's a six!

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:16.360
India 347 for 5.
- Yes.

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:17.880
Why does he keep hitting sixes?

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.040
How about some tea?

01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.400
He was in great form today.

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.480
If he had played
higher up in the order

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:28.520
he would've definitely
scored a century.

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:29.600
Stop it, Chittu.

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:31.640
I wonder what's
going to happen now.

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:34.280
He only made 19 runs
in 3 matches.

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.520
I wonder if he'll get a chance
in the Pakistan Tour.

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.120
India's run-rate has come down
a little bit in the last 5 overs.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.720
Dravid is set here.

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.360
It's in the air!
Six!

01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:52.320
And taken at deep mid-wicket.

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:54.280
You should start praying.

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:56.240
He should've played defensively.

01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:57.920
Only 3.5 overs to go.

01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.880
He was playing for
the team not himself.

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:04.080
So, Dhoni departs and a string
of low scores continues.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.240
What are you doing?

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.400
And why doesn't he cut his hair?

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.120
I wonder how he'll
stay in the team.

01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.440
Let's see where the
match goes from here.

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.120
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.400
Can you please get me
Sachin's autograph? Please.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.840
Sorry, ma'am,
the cricketers are very tired.

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.800
And they have requested
to be left alone.

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:45.480
I hope you understand.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:57.720
Hi.
- Hi.

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.800
Are you with the cricket team?
- Yes.

01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:05.760
Do you know Sachin?

01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:09.480
Yes.

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.280
Can you please get
me his autograph?

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.400
No.. - Please. - No..
- Please..

01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:15.840
I'm his biggest fan.

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:17.240
But right now..
- Please!

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:22.960
What's your name?
- Priyanka.

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:25.320
Priyanka.. - Please..
- Give it to me.

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:26.640
Thank you.

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.640
His condition was really
surprising.. - I know!

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:32.480
Sir, one autograph please.
- Sure.

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:34.360
She is a huge fan of yours.

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.920
Priyanka.

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.240
Thank you.

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.560
Thank you.

01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.840
What do you do?

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:02.920
I'm a keeper-batsman.

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:04.720
Oh?
- In the Indian Team.

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.200
Sorry, I didn't know.
- Why are you sorry?

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.560
You don't know because I have not
done anything worth remembering.

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:21.280
In four matches I have
0, 12, 7 not out and a 3.

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:25.360
I don't know whether I'll get
a chance to play the next match.

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.360
It's okay.

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:50.000
If you keep staring at me,
how will I sleep?

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.760
Sorry.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.760
You know what.

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.560
You will get to play tomorrow

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:08.840
and you will have a great match.

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.920
How come you're so sure?

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.560
Just one of those things.

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:21.680
All the best.

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:27.840
If it really happens
and if I want to thank you

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.520
then how can I..

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:32.640
I mean..

01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:36.000
So, ma'am?

01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:46.440
Thank you.

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:48.360
Your name?

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.320
Watch it on TV tomorrow.

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:18.760
Yes, Santosh.
- How are you, Mahi?

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.360
Fine, but you've been
drinking again.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:25.480
No, Mahi, I swear, not at all.
- Swear on me.

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:28.560
Let it be.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.160
Santosh,
I'm going to beat you up.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.280
You always..
- Let's talk about cricket.

01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.640
Why don't they move you up?
- They were saying

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.640
that they will try sending me in
at No.3 in some game.

01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:42.520
But I have no clue whether
I'm in tomorrow's match.

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:45.640
I'll call you later.

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.800
Hello. - 'Dhoni, you're in the 11.'
- Thanks, Dada.

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.960
Good luck.

01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:02.960
That's it.

01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.880
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:13.480
Mahi, take a look.

01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:24.720
Chisel 50 grams more.
- Okay.

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.520
Here, chisel off 50 grams more.

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.760
Mahendra Singh Dhoni
promoted up the order.

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.160
Looking to get the full Monty.

01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.440
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:45.720
Why are you bathing
since so long? Come out.

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.440
I don't want to watch
the match today.

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:55.240
Drives and drives well through the
off-side. Finds the boundary!

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:02.720
Yay!

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:06.160
That's beautifully timed,
through the off-side.

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:09.560
He finds the fence again.
And a half century

01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:11.640
for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:14.760
I've always been saying
that Mahi should go in early.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:16.160
Stop it, Chittu.

01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:23.360
Yes!

01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.800
Don't throw your wicket.
Well done.

01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:37.840
It's outside the boundary.

01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:40.120
Mister, give me a carom board.
- I don't have it.

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.360
There's one right beside you.

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:42.640
It got drenched in the rain
and the wood has swollen up.

01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:44.440
But it's all wrapped up.

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:47.320
Do you know better or do we?
Who's the shop-keeper?

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:49.840
Come back tomorrow. - What
kind of a shop-keeper are you?

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:07.160
There he goes on the on-side!

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:11.400
What happened?
- Nothing, you continue.

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.920
He pumps the air in delight.

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:19.240
A first One Day International 100
for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:20.480
Bravo.

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:25.760
And it's always a great feeling,
getting your first ever 100

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.760
in One Day International cricket
for your country.

01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:31.720
And it's obvious that this
young man is thrilled to bits.

01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:35.960
Later, boy, later.

01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:40.480
Sir. Mahi played very well.

01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:41.960
Take some more, sir.

01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.640
Hello, ma'am.

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:46.120
Give everyone, everyone.
- Mahi played really well.

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.240
Take some sweets.

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:50.200
You too, ma'am.

01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:54.240
Hello, sir.
Mahi was amazing yesterday.

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:14.240
'You will get to play tomorrow'

01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:16.240
'and you will have a great match.'

01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:47.920
Hello.
- Hello.

01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.880
Priyanka?
- Speaking.

01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:52.680
Thanks.

01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:56.880
Hello.

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:01.920
Congratulations,
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:04.600
Thank you.

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:08.240
Everyone in India
now knows your name.

01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:11.040
Maybe someone's prayers worked.

01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:13.960
Maybe?

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:16.680
Would you like to meet?

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:19.920
You will have to come to Delhi.
That's where I live.

01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:22.280
I came to Vizag on
official business.

01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:24.440
I'm at the airport,
heading back home.

01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:26.120
Oh!

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:30.160
By the way,
if you change your mind

01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:31.840
then Delhi isn't too far.

01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.040
It wouldn't have mattered
even if it had been far.

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.040
See you soon.

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:40.960
I'll be waiting
for your autograph.

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:43.360
Bye.

01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:17.480
"This moment stands still."

01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:23.240
"It is mine and yours."

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.840
"Let me live this
moment to the fullest."

01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:34.960
"I'll be lost in you and
you'll be lost in me."

01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:39.400
"We'll find each other
sometime again."

01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.560
"I'll keep seeing you."

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:46.320
"You'll keep seeing me."

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:52.560
"We'll see each other
sometime again. Sometime again."

01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:18.760
"Why does it hum
without a reason?"

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:24.040
"Why does it smile
without a reason?"

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:29.800
"My eyes have begun to glitter."

01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:35.920
"How shall I conceal
my dreams now?"

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:41.720
"Say words that are fragrant"

01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:47.720
"fill your eyes with laughter."

01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.800
"This bewilderment,
where else to look!"

01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:59.280
"I'll be lost in you and
you'll be lost in me."

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:04.840
"We'll find each other
sometime again."

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:10.560
"I'll keep seeing you.
You'll keep seeing me."

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:15.560
"We'll see each other
sometime again."

01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:18.400
"Sometime again."

01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.520
Hair, hair.
One second.

01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:34.480
Do I look at this one or that one?

01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:36.160
Okay. On action?
- Yes!

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:38.120
Finolex pipes are..

01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.760
I forgot my lines.

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:42.080
Action! - The secret
behind my active life.

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:44.920
Low fat cooking with
Nature Fresh Acti-Lite Oil.

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:47.920
Whether there's pressure
in the game or the water

01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:50.960
Finolex pipes are
unbreakable like me, always.

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:54.600
Conquer the world with
Sanjay Ghodawat Institutes.

01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:03.000
Where will you be going from here?
- Ranchi.

01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.680
And Pakistan?
- On 5th January.

01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:07.200
For how long?

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:09.800
Until 20th February.

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.480
3 tests and 5 one-day matches.

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.120
Will you miss me?

01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:20.640
No.

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:23.280
Why?
- Missing you will distract me.

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:25.760
And you cannot afford
to have distraction

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:27.280
when you're playing
for your country.

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:30.520
Why do you even meet me?

01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:34.560
Because I like it.

01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:37.320
Don't you like it?
- I do. - Then?

01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:39.400
In fact, I want
to meet you every day

01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.440
and always be with you.

01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:53.120
Priyanka, I recently
started playing for India.

01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:57.160
I need time.

01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:03.720
What happened?

01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:06.400
You look worried.

01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:08.120
Why would I be worried?

01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:10.800
I just don't want you to feel hurt.

01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:13.160
Do you really like me that much?

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:18.240
It's not that.
- So, you don't like me?

01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:19.920
You're trapping me.

01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:26.520
Mahi.

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:30.160
I think I really love you.

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:39.960
Don't worry,
I don't need an answer.

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:47.720
Do you have Chittu's number?
- Yes.

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:48.960
My phone will be switched off.

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:51.080
So, if you have any message,
give it to him.

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:53.160
I will call you back.

02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:01.800
Mahi, are you sure?

02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:06.000
We do have a lot of time, right?

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:08.680
Of course.

02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:33.280
There you go!
India win by 5 wickets!

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:35.680
They take a 2-1 lead
in the series.

02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:39.400
I would first of all like
to congratulate the Indian team

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.040
for playing exceptionally well.

02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:45.320
And may I specially
congratulate Dhoni

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.960
for being the architect
of the victory.

02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:53.440
And may I, may I tell Dhoni

02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:54.840
that I saw a placard

02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:57.360
asking you to have a haircut.

02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:59.560
But if you were
to take my opinion

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.400
you look good in this haircut.

02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:02.760
Don't have a haircut.

02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:04.560
Okay!

02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:16.640
What is this?
How do I switch this thing on?

02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:18.320
Here you go.

02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:19.800
Hello.

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:21.160
Dad, it's Mahi.

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:24.560
Yes, Mahi.
You played really well today.

02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:27.320
Everyone was praising
your game today.

02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:30.000
Did Musharraf say anything else?

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:31.920
No, Dad.

02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:34.720
Are you happy?

02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:38.360
Yes, I'm very happy.

02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:41.800
I'm happy to be proven wrong.

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:45.240
Just keep playing well.

02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.960
Make your country proud.

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.040
And don't let all this
go to your head.

02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:53.480
Yes.

02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:55.720
Hang up.
Get some rest.

02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:15.960
'This call could not be completed
due to insufficient balance.'

02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:39.960
Hi, is there a PCO around?
- Yes, take the next left.

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:42.160
Thank you. - Mr. Dhoni!
- Yes.

02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:44.520
Mr. Dhoni, you were amazing today.

02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:46.560
I swear, I really enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:47.920
You want to make a call, right?
- Yes.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.840
Then do it from here.
- No, I want to make an ISD call.

02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.160
Do it from here, no problem.
- It's okay, I'll manage.

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:54.960
Come on, this is unbelievable.

02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:57.960
You can call from here,
I'll wait outside.

02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:00.400
Sure?
- Yes, of course. Make the call.

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.480
Hello.

02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:13.200
Were you waiting
next to the phone?

02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:15.440
I knew you would call today.

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:17.440
How does it feel, Mr. Mahendra?

02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:19.480
How do you feel, ma'am?

02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:22.240
Feels like I made you
win the match.

02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:27.080
Do you want anything from here?
- Win the series.

02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:29.280
Anything else?

02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.200
Just come back soon.

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:34.160
Why are you whispering?

02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:37.680
Because my family's having dinner
in the next room.

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:39.680
Oh!

02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:43.760
Should I tell them about you?

02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:49.320
Let's discuss this when I'm back.

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:53.960
You get so worried.

02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:00.320
Well, I haven't even told
my best friend how much I love you.

02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:02.080
Who is your best friend?

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:04.480
You.

02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:09.760
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day, Mahi.

02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:11.440
What do I buy for you?

02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:14.800
Buy a nice watch for me.

02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:16.520
Something that's
affordable and durable.

02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:18.160
Done.

02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:19.800
What will you get for me?

02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:22.080
I don't believe in Valentine's Day.

02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:23.960
You..

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:32.760
Mahi.

02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:33.840
Yes?

02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:39.600
Mahi, are you sure we have time?
- Of course.

02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:41.960
See you soon.

02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.280
See you.

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:46.040
See you.

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:24.840
"I can feel you in me
whenever I breathe."

02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:31.360
"The crossway of your heart"

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:37.560
"I pass through every day."

02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:42.160
"You tease me like the free wind"

02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:46.280
"and I aberrate like loose sand."

02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:50.640
"Who'll love you as much"

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:54.960
"as I love you."

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:36.960
"The quest of my vision
stops with you."

02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:41.760
"What more is left to express?"

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:45.360
"Nothing is left unsaid."

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:49.880
"My eyes long for your eyes."

02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:53.320
"and you're unaware of that."

02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:11.040
"I gaze at your eyes"

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:15.560
"while hiding
my feelings from you."

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:19.960
"Who'll love you as much"

02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:24.360
"as I love you."

02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:46.080
That's pitched up!
Hammered over mid-on!

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.320
India win by 8 wickets.

02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:51.880
And once again, it's that man
at the finishing line.

02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:53.560
Mahendra Singh Dhoni

02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:55.400
quietly earning a name

02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:56.800
of a finisher.

02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:16.840
Hello, Mahi.
You were spectacular today.

02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:18.640
It was really fun.
- Great.

02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:21.000
Did Priyanka call you?

02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:22.120
No.

02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:23.320
I've been trying to call her
since 3-4 days.

02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:24.840
But her phone's not reachable.

02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:26.760
Did she give you
an alternate number?

02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:28.400
Yes, I do have her
friend's number.

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:30.480
Find out.
- Okay.

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:31.800
When are you coming to Ranchi?

02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:32.840
Day after tomorrow.

02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.960
Find out and let me know.
- Okay.

02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:36.160
See you.

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:45.560
Mahi! Mahi..
- One second, just a second.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.400
Here.

02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:49.960
Let's go.

02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:51.640
Mahi.

02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:54.040
Mahi, there's a horde
of media outside.

02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:55.160
The car's parked at the back.

02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:57.320
But my bag..
- We'll deal with that, let's go.

02:08:57.400 --> 02:08:58.400
Move, move!

02:08:58.520 --> 02:08:59.480
Move.

02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:03.000
Mahi!

02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:05.040
Mahi!

02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:07.120
Mahi!

02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:09.040
Mahi!

02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:10.920
Mahi!

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:15.360
Where's Chittu?
- He called.

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.120
He said he'll meet you
directly at home.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.280
Give me your phone.

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:32.120
Yes.
- Mahi speaking.

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:36.480
Oh.. - Why aren't you
answering my calls?

02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:39.800
Well, I was stuck and..

02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:44.560
Did you find out?

02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.680
Yes.. Well, no.

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:50.280
I mean,
I'll tell you when we meet.

02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:54.960
What's wrong, Chittu?

02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:00.720
Well..
P-Priyanka met with an accident

02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:02.560
on the 14th.

02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:31.520
Please stop the car.

02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:34.880
Why? What's wrong, Mahi?
- Please stop for a minute.

02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:39.400
There's something I need to do,
you guys go ahead.

02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:41.680
What.. I mean, we'll wait.

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:43.160
How will you get back home?
- I'm telling you.

02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:00.680
'Mahi, are you sure?'

02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:03.720
'We do have a lot of time, right?'

02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:58.600
India beaten by Bangladesh
by 5 wickets.

02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:13.520
The faces say it all.

02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:53.560
Mahi!

02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:58.600
Good morning, sir.

02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:00.160
How are you, sir?

02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:05.040
Watching your success
makes me proud.

02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.320
It's all thanks
to people like you, sir.

02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:11.520
There's something I have wanted
to tell you for a long time now.

02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:13.000
Yes, sir?

02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:15.520
Mahi, it's not like
I didn't want to

02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:19.600
or couldn't send you
to Kolkata that day.

02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:23.920
But since I was busy
with meetings

02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:28.480
I didn't realise that you..

02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:34.360
Don't hold that against me.

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:37.440
Don't think like that, sir.

02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:41.560
Keep going like this.

02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:44.480
And don't get complacent.
- Yes.

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:48.080
You still have a long way to go.
- Yes.

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:50.680
And aggression suits you.

02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:53.560
Don't try to play defensive.

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:01.640
Bless you.
- Thank you, sir.

02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:11.360
What a setting

02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:14.760
for the first World T-20 final!

02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:16.400
We are in Johannesburg

02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.120
and at 'The Bullring'

02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:20.720
one of the great stadiums
in world cricket.

02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:24.760
13 needed from 6.

02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:27.800
That's a huge wide!

02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:34.480
Misbah goes big!

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.760
It's huge, it's a six!

02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:40.360
Just six needed now for Pakistan!

02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:47.320
And M.S. Dhoni walking up
to his bowler to have a chat.

02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:50.920
Sree!

02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:01.200
It's up in the air..
Sreesanth

02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:02.640
takes it!

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:04.720
India have beaten Pakistan

02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:07.760
to win the World T-20 title!

02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:10.720
The celebrations begin!

02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:19.600
It's a young Indian team
that lifts the T-20 World Cup

02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:22.200
with all the big boys resting.

02:16:33.799 --> 02:16:35.879
Now he's going to wreak havoc.

02:16:46.719 --> 02:16:47.680
Yes.

02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:49.959
Mahi, time for the tele-conference.

02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:51.080
Sure.

02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:01.959
Hi, M.S.
- Hi, sirs.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.400
Hi.
- Hi.

02:17:03.879 --> 02:17:06.559
So, as you know, today's
agenda is to.. - Excuse me, sir.

02:17:06.959 --> 02:17:09.600
Before we start this discussion,
can I say something?

02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:10.799
Yes, sure.

02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:12.600
Sir, if we want to win

02:17:12.639 --> 02:17:14.400
we must take some tough calls.

02:17:14.639 --> 02:17:16.680
I'm taking a tough call today
as a captain

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:19.559
and I want you, sirs, to take
an important call as selectors

02:17:19.639 --> 02:17:21.320
who want the betterment
of Indian cricket.

02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:23.520
What's the matter, M.S?

02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:27.240
Sir, three players
no longer fit the ODI team.

02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:32.080
They are very slow
as fielders, sir

02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:33.959
and the format
needs fitter players.

02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:36.240
Age is not the issue, sir,
fitness is.

02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:38.600
But M.S, they are still
very good as batsmen.

02:17:38.639 --> 02:17:39.799
No doubt, sir.

02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:41.080
But due to their fielding

02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:42.680
we never succeed
in choking the opposition.

02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:44.360
The result is that they
keep rotating the strike

02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:45.799
and we can't build
pressure on them.

02:17:45.879 --> 02:17:47.559
And here in Australia,
the grounds are bigger.

02:17:47.879 --> 02:17:50.280
This also has an adverse effect
on the other team members.

02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:51.879
It reduces their morale.

02:17:52.639 --> 02:17:53.639
I'm a sportsman myself.

02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:55.559
I can understand they
don't want to give up

02:17:55.920 --> 02:17:57.160
but the fact of the matter is

02:17:57.200 --> 02:17:58.520
that we just can't
have them in the team.

02:17:58.559 --> 02:17:59.799
Sir, a bowler will take wickets

02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:02.600
a good batsman will
make runs in some matches.

02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:05.959
But a good fielder will save
runs for you in every match.

02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:08.879
We've just lost
the test series, M.S.

02:18:09.959 --> 02:18:11.639
Do you think we can
turn it around in One Days?

02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:13.280
Sir, I can't promise you that.

02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:15.600
But this will definitely
start a process.

02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:18.440
And I think we should also
be looking at the 2011 World Cup.

02:18:18.719 --> 02:18:22.799
The sooner we make a core team,
the better chances we'll have.

02:18:22.879 --> 02:18:25.799
But M.S, the World Cup
is three years later.

02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:28.559
Sir, only three years
to the World Cup.

02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:29.959
We have to let these three go.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.719
At least for this tour,
and then decide.

02:18:31.879 --> 02:18:34.240
This will have
large scale implications.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.040
And he is a huge servant
of Indian Cricket.

02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:39.080
Precisely, sir,
we're all servants

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:40.840
and we're all
doing national duty.

02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:42.959
I know they will feel bad.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.280
The media is going to burn us.

02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:45.600
People will feel bad.

02:18:45.639 --> 02:18:49.000
But if we're right and if we
achieve results in the future

02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:51.680
then people will understand
why we did what we did.

02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:55.480
I think, sir, more than players
we need characters.

02:18:55.559 --> 02:18:57.240
Characters who want
to express themselves.

02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:58.639
Characters who are desperate.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.639
If we invest in the youth today

02:19:00.719 --> 02:19:02.320
only then can we expect
results in the future.

02:19:05.799 --> 02:19:07.760
M.S, we'll reconnect with you
in 10 minutes. - Right.

02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:09.120
Sure, sir.

02:19:15.959 --> 02:19:17.559
He's pretty new to this game.

02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:20.320
He'll understand
when it's his time.

02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:23.760
How I see it is that he has
got results in T-20 World Cup.

02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:25.760
He's eyeing One Day World Cup.

02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:02.880
That's mistimed in the air
and Chawla takes it!

02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:05.440
India win the
Commonwealth Bank Series!

02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:07.320
They've beaten Australia

02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:08.640
by 10 runs.

02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:19.960
Orient fan's air
reaches every corner.

02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:21.440
Switch to smart.

02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:24.080
Lava never lets you down.

02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:32.120
For instant pickup, I use Gulf
Pride 4T Plus Bike Engine Oil.

02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:35.560
Whether the fight's on the field
or against pimples on the face

02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:38.480
I will always win with
Garnier Men Face wash.

02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:40.560
Whether it's cricket or insurance

02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:42.440
a long relationship
is all about trust.

02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:44.040
Exide Life Insurance.

02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:06.400
Yes.

02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:08.600
M.S. these guys have arrived.
- Coming.

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:50.240
Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:53.720
I think I've misplaced my keycard.
- No problem, sir.

02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:55.200
Please follow me.

02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:58.400
This way, please.

02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:02.360
Please, sir.

02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:08.160
Sir, could you help me
with your name, please?

02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:11.640
Sorry?
- Sir, your name.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.280
Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:15.760
Okay.

02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:19.800
Sir, your room number?
- 601.

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:24.480
Right.
Could I have some ID, please?

02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:27.960
I don't have any ID.

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:31.320
Actually, it's in my room
and I've locked myself out.

02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:34.560
Sorry, sir,
I need to see some ID.

02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:39.120
Sakshi, right?
- Yes, sir.

02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:41.120
Sakshi, tell me something.

02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:43.680
Why will I pretend
to be Mahendra Singh Dhoni?

02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:46.280
I don't know, sir.
It's..

02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:48.200
Actually, I am interning
with this hotel

02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:50.080
and this is what we've
been instructed to do.

02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:53.760
Okay, Sakshi,
why don't we do this?

02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:56.120
You take my keycard,
we'll go to my room.

02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:58.480
And then I'll show you my ID.
Will that be okay?

02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:00.120
Yes..

02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:02.360
Mr. Sanjay, could I do that?
- Yes, please.

02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:05.320
See, we can.
- Sure, sir. Please.

02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:08.320
This way.

02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:36.720
Just a second.

02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:51.320
Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:52.560
Have a good day, sir.
- Thank you.

02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:53.800
Thank you.
- You too.

02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:00.120
There she is.

02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:04.480
What happened, guys?

02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:07.200
Sakshi, do you really
not know who it is?

02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:13.400
I.. I'm so sorry, sir.
I didn't recognise you.

02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:17.040
Thank you. It's okay.

02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:19.880
Actually, I don't like cricket,
so I'm..

02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:22.080
I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean it like that.

02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:24.120
I'm really sorry,
I didn't mean to..

02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:26.200
Can I have your autograph?
- I'm sorry?

02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:27.920
Just a second.

02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:30.440
Damn!

02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:33.760
You were doing your job.

02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:35.520
You really didn't
care about anything.

02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:36.720
It's rare.

02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:40.480
Can I have your autograph?
- But sir, I..

02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:42.520
It's okay.
- That's so embarrassing.

02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:44.040
How can I..
- Go for it.

02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:45.960
Okay.

02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:57.440
Have a good day, sir.
- I'm having one, Sakshi.

02:24:57.480 --> 02:24:58.840
Sir, thank you.

02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:16.280
'Does Dhoni not want
to play with Viru?'

02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:18.640
'Do the two have
personal differences?'

02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:21.200
'Are Viru and Dhoni fighting?'

02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:23.120
'Is Mahi angry with Viru?'

02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:27.720
'Why has Mahi removed Viru
from the One Day team?'

02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:30.840
'Is this the reason
for the divide in Team India?'

02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:59.800
All right, leadership skills
in hospitality do demand

02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:02.040
understanding of the open
communication model

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.480
by Johari Window.

02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:06.560
It was evolved by two people,
Joseph and Harry.

02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:07.840
Now the first..

02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:15.400
With themselves and others,
which was created

02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:19.120
by psychologists Joseph Luft
and Harrington Ingham.

02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:28.480
Hello.

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:31.160
Hi, Sakshi,
Mahendra Singh Dhoni speaking.

02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:36.960
Hi.

02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:41.960
Well, I'm coming to Kolkata,
day after tomorrow.

02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:45.480
But I'm in my college
in Aurangabad.

02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:46.800
Oh..

02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:51.480
Aurangabad isn't really that far.

02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:55.240
If you make up your mind

02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:56.640
then Delhi isn't too far, Mahendra.

02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:04.160
Hello.
- Okay, bye.

02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:33.080
Hello.
- Where are you?

02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:35.920
It's 4 a.m.
I'm in my hostel, obviously.

02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:37.920
You said Aurangabad isn't too far.

02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:39.920
But I had to go through hell
to get here.

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:43.560
You're in Aurangabad!

02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:46.920
I'm staying in Hotel Rama,
Room No. 304.

02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:48.760
I'm here for just two days.

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:51.240
Come and meet me
if you're in the mood.

02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:52.680
Bye.

02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:03.320
Ritu. Ritu.

02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:05.440
Ritu, listen.
- What?

02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:07.560
Do you know
Mahendra Singh Dhoni?

02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:09.000
Yes.

02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:10.360
He's really hot.

02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:11.960
Would you like to meet him?

02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:14.200
I just met him
day before yesterday.

02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:16.400
He kissed me on my cheeks.

02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:19.440
Things were getting interesting
when the alarm started ringing.

02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:38.800
Here you go.

02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:42.840
Greetings, ma'am.
- Greetings.

02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:49.120
Who are we going to meet?
- Come on.

02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.960
You're creating such suspense.

02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:57.320
Sakshi, you better tell me
where we are going!

02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:58.400
Just wait.

02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:00.680
Ritu! Ritu! Ritu!
Ritu! Sorry, sorry.

02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:01.560
Please wait.

02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:03.040
See, 315 is here.

02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:05.160
304 must be here somewhere.
- Okay.

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:10.840
What.. - Hello.
- Hi.

02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:12.840
Come in.

02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:20.920
Just a moment.
- Sure.

02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:24.320
Mahendra Singh..
- Ritu, shut up, shut up. Please.

02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:26.840
That's Mahendra Singh Dhoni.
Oh, my God!- Just chill.

02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:29.400
I knew you would
bring a friend along. - Chill!

02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:31.000
Yes, this is my friend, Ritu.

02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:33.040
Hi, Ritu!

02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:34.760
Say 'hi'.

02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:35.960
Hi.

02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:39.880
He's so cute.
- Take me for sight-seeing.

02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:42.520
If people see you,
it will create a huge ruckus.

02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:43.800
Keep quiet!

02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:45.960
No one will recognise me.

02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:48.840
Come.
- Let's go.

02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:50.960
Let's go.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:16.160
"Until I simmer
in the warmth of your heart.."

02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:23.280
"Until I travel
to the moon with you.."

02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:30.760
"Stay near me
and don't talk of going away."

02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:38.160
"Stay with me
and don't talk of going away."

02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:53.640
"Until I simmer
in the warmth of your heart.."

02:30:54.360 --> 02:31:00.960
"Until I travel
to the moon with you.."

02:31:01.320 --> 02:31:08.280
"Stay near me
and don't talk of going away."

02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:15.720
"Stay with me
and don't talk of going away."

02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:32.120
What happened?

02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:41.440
Nothing.

02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:48.040
What next?

02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:51.040
What do you mean?

02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:54.240
I mean

02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:58.400
you come to Aurangabad
to meet me.

02:31:58.680 --> 02:31:59.720
Yes.

02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:01.960
I come to meet you in Mumbai.

02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:03.400
Yes.

02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:08.480
What happens next?

02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:26.880
Next..

02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:31.760
I'll drop you to Aurangabad.

02:32:46.320 --> 02:32:49.040
"That which would suit you"

02:32:49.280 --> 02:32:52.800
"that which would make
you look stunning.."

02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:56.640
"What's that gift
which I could offer you?"

02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:00.400
"What's that gift
which I could offer you?"

02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:08.120
"The lines of my hand.."

02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:11.960
"Let me gift them to you."

02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:15.760
"Let me gift them to you."

02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:23.520
"Until my eyes are
filled with your beauty.."

02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:30.760
"Until I die and live
in your melody.."

02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:38.320
"Stay near me and don't
talk of going away."

02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:45.600
"Stay with me and don't
talk of going away."

02:33:57.040 --> 02:33:58.920
Ma'am, how long
have you been with Dhoni?

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:00.960
What relationship do you
and Dhoni share?

02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:05.360
Sakshi, do you love Dhoni?

02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:18.520
Move back! Please!

02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:23.280
Sakshi, are you okay?
Don't worry, let's go.

02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:25.280
Come.

02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:36.320
Excuse me.

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:37.600
Good afternoon.

02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:39.120
Mr. Satyaprakash?
- Yes.

02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:40.520
Sir, this way please.

02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:49.720
This way.

02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:50.840
Yes, sir.

02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:53.280
No, I understand, sir.

02:34:56.440 --> 02:34:57.720
Just a second, sir.

02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:02.320
No, sir.

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:05.160
Sir, the entire team-selection
discussion

02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:06.760
gets leaked to the media.

02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:07.800
I only express my
point of view

02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:09.320
and the next day,
in the media, they say

02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:11.720
'Dhoni didn't want
that particular player.'

02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:15.160
Sir, one of our own selectors
is leaking the news to the media.

02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:19.560
You tell me, sir. How is my
team supposed to trust me?

02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:21.280
A captain is only
as good as the team.

02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:25.840
And secondly sir,
if you can't give me my team

02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:27.480
then I don't want
the captaincy either.

02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:31.640
Sir, I have no interest
in the captaincy

02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:32.960
because I can't be a puppet.

02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:35.360
Thanks, sir.

02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:40.840
How are you, Satya?

02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:42.640
I won't be fooled again.

02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:46.320
There was no one on the phone,
right?

02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:48.680
You were only pretending.

02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:54.760
You're right, you caught me.
- I knew it.

02:35:57.320 --> 02:35:59.480
You now speak such good English,
Mahi.

02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:02.800
You've become a big man.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.320
What big?

02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:10.720
When you play, millions of
people hold their breath.

02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:12.360
Because of you.

02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:17.160
Forget that.
How is everyone in Kharagpur?

02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:18.880
All okay.

02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:21.200
I came over because
I wanted to see you.

02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:22.520
You did the right thing.

02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:25.240
See you.

02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:27.480
I'm a nobody and
you must be a busy man.

02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:30.360
I'll make some tea for us.
- No, no. I'll leave now.

02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:39.600
Okay, see you.
- See you.

02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:43.480
Can I say something?
- Of course.

02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:47.200
That lady who showed
me the way here. - Yes?

02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:50.400
She was wearing
very short clothes.

02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:53.640
I'll do something about it.

02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:56.280
Bless you.

02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:19.000
Hello.
- How are you? All okay?

02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:22.440
All well. You?
- Fine.

02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:24.840
Well, my second test
starts tomorrow.

02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:26.400
So my phone will
be switched off.

02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:30.200
Mahi, mom was asking about you.

02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:34.120
What did you say?

02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:38.040
What I always say,
that we're friends.

02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:41.960
There's nothing wrong
with that, Sakshi.

02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:45.400
Are we just friends, Mahi?

02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:49.400
Mahi, I like you.

02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:53.880
I trust you,
but this stupid news..

02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:57.080
All this makes me really upset.

02:37:58.560 --> 02:37:59.760
I get hurt.

02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:04.480
And I think I love you
and that's why I get hurt.

02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:07.600
So, avoid everything like I do.

02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:10.800
I'm not like you, Mahi.

02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:17.000
My world is different from
yours. It's much smaller.

02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:20.480
I just don't know
what you're thinking.

02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:23.840
I don't know how
important I am to you.

02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:26.160
Well, at least you know
that you're important to me.

02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:29.520
Sometimes it's better to say it,
Mahi.

02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:36.440
Sakshi..

02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:37.760
Look at me,
you have a game tomorrow

02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:39.920
and there I go again.

02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:42.720
Well,
tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:45.000
What should I buy for you?

02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:49.080
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day,
Mahi.

02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:50.960
What should I buy for you?

02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:06.440
I don't believe
in Valentine's Day.

02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:08.320
Of course.

02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:11.520
Have a good match, Mahi.

02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:36.160
Yes, Mahi.

02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:39.480
Sakshi, my world
isn't bigger than yours.

02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:42.280
In fact, it's only
as big as a cricket kit bag.

02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:44.080
You'll have to
endure all this.

02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:45.840
So, think before you answer.

02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:49.120
Will you marry me?

02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:55.360
Are you sure, Mahi?

02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:58.040
As sure as I'm of getting
a century in the next match.

02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:04.240
Will you marry me, Sakshi?

02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:11.720
Yes, Mahi!

02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:14.640
Yes.

02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:40.280
"Until I fill up your life
with unconditional love.."

02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:47.520
"Until I learn you as my prayers
a hundred times and over.."

02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:54.720
"Stay near me and don't
talk of going away."

02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:02.600
"Stay with me and don't
talk of going away."

02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:39.760
"You've come into my arms"

02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:43.520
"with millions of sunrises."

02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:47.800
"With millions of sunrises."

02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:55.480
"You've been brought
from the skies"

02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:58.920
"for me."

02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:03.280
"Only for me."

02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:10.800
"Until my fingers
say something to your tresses.."

02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:18.200
"Until my desires sail
in the stream of your love.."

02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:25.320
"Stay near me and don't
talk of going away."

02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:33.360
"Stay with me and don't
talk of going away."

02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:54.960
The Wankhede Stadium on their feet.

02:42:55.240 --> 02:43:00.200
So, Sri Lanka end up 274 for 6
after their 50 overs.

02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:01.520
The target for India

02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:04.720
when they come out to bat.. 275!

02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:06.760
Now that is a massive score

02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:08.080
in a World Cup final.

02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:10.760
No team has ever won it
in their home country

02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:14.280
and India have
a job on their hands.

02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:16.720
The crowd expectant.

02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:19.560
They are in anticipation.

02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:40.840
What do you think, Mr. Tiwari?
Who's going to win?

02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:43.960
Let's see how the match plays out.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.880
We're going to lose
today! - Shut up!

02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:49.760
Stupid guy! - India
about to start their innings

02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:52.840
as the two Indian openers
come out to bat.

02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:55.720
Virender Sehwag
and Sachin Tendulkar.

02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:01.880
Malinga on his way.
Sehwag is the man on strike.

02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:07.440
Howzat! - Rapped on the pads,
a finger goes up!

02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:08.720
This is close!

02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:11.640
And Sehwag wants to go upstairs.

02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:24.400
He is in big, big trouble
as the finger goes up. - Oh, no!

02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:27.960
Virender Sehwag dismissed.
India lose their first wicket.

02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:36.520
Edged and taken! It's Tendulkar
who has to depart.

02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:40.880
India lose their second wicket
with just 31 runs on the board.

02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:43.480
Pin drop silence around
the Wankhede Stadium

02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:45.520
as the Master departs

02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:48.480
for the final time
in World Cup cricket.

02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:50.960
And a young Turk comes
out to the centre

02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:53.440
with number 18 on his back.

02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:55.280
Virat Kohli!

02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:13.360
Crucial moment in the game.

02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:15.480
Muttiah Muralitharan.

02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:19.440
The Wizard of the Emerald Isle
being introduced into the attack.

02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:35.640
Excuse me, Gary.
- Yes.

02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:37.880
If a wicket goes down,
I think I should go in.

02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:40.000
But Yuvi is padded up and ready.

02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:42.120
No, it's Murali.
I think I should go in.

02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:43.560
You sure?
- Yes.

02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:45.040
Just tell him, I'll.. I'll go.

02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:53.960
No..

02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:59.040
Has to hurry. Chance of a
run out. Gambhir survives.

02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:11.520
Catch it!

02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:14.160
It's a stunning catch.
Kohli has to depart.

02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:16.280
India now in a spot of bother.

02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:18.440
A 114 for 3.

02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:40.120
Yuvraj Singh has to wait.

02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:42.800
The skipper rolls up his sleeves

02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:44.640
and makes his way out
to the centre.

02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:46.480
Mahendra Singh Dhoni

02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:48.400
promotes himself
in the batting order

02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:50.280
and this is a World Cup final.

02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:53.920
India 3 down, the skipper
making his way to the middle.

02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:05.840
This is a massive moment
in the World Cup.

02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:07.360
Huge moment in the game.

02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:10.400
He's not had the best of World Cups
with the bat so far.

02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:14.160
But the captain here trying
to make a statement.

02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:54.280
Hit harder, Mahi!

02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:12.840
Come on!

02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:27.280
Mahi, what a shot!

02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:32.920
Didn't I tell you?

02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:34.400
Didn't I tell you
that if Mahi comes up

02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:36.120
he's going to hit really hard?

02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:39.080
Massive ruckus from
the Indian captain.

02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:40.920
This is a World Cup final.

02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:42.920
He's in the zone!

02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:46.320
He now realises that he has
reached a half century.

02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:49.800
The crowd senses there's something
special in the offing.

02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:52.280
52 needed off 53

02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:54.360
and Perera on his way.

02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:56.120
He's gone!

02:48:56.200 --> 02:48:57.760
Looking to give himself room

02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:00.040
Gautam Gambhir
misses it altogether.

02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:01.920
It's cleaned up here by Perera.

02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:05.680
And Sri Lanka believe
they still have a chance.

02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:09.240
This is a World Cup final.
275 the target.

02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:12.920
India now 223 for 4.

02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:30.160
11 needed off 16.

02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:40.080
That's whipped away on the on-side.
He finds the boundary.

02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:42.560
There's dancing in the aisles.

02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:44.440
The whole of the country

02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:46.840
senses a World Cup win!

02:49:56.680 --> 02:49:58.600
4 runs to win.

02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:01.120
11 balls remaining.

02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:04.160
What a moment this is!

02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:06.080
History in the making!

02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:08.360
India have never won a World Cup

02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:10.440
in the last 28 years.

02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:15.000
The nation on their feet..
- India. - India..

02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:18.080
Dhoni!
- Mahi!

02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:23.080
...as are the crowd
at the Wankhede Stadium.

02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:29.120
The prayers begin.

02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:31.880
Dhoni!

02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:34.040
Fingers being crossed!

02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:41.040
People on edge.

02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:44.920
Mahendra Singh Dhoni on strike.

02:50:56.360 --> 02:50:57.960
Dhoni finishes off in style!

02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:00.160
A magnificent strike
into the crowd!

02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:03.280
India lift the World Cup
after 28 years!

02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:07.680
And it's an Indian captain who
has been absolutely magnificent

02:51:07.720 --> 02:51:09.400
on the night of the final.

02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:21.320
So, India have won
the World Cup once again

02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:24.240
after 28 years!
