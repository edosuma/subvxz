WHEN SHE'S READY.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.375
PROFESSOR FIELDING,

01:37.458 --> 01:40.000
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THIS DISCOVERY?

01:40.083 --> 01:43.041
WELL, THESE ARROWHEADS
AND SHARPENED STONES PROVE

01:43.125 --> 01:44.667
THAT THIS WAS
A HUNTING GROUND

01:44.750 --> 01:46.375
FOR SEVERAL PRIMITIVE
HUMAN TRIBES.

01:46.458 --> 01:48.458

01:48.542 --> 01:50.250

I'D RATHER KEEP DIGGING.

UH, PROFESSOR FIELDING...

01:55.875 --> 01:57.959
HOW DOES
THIS DIG COMPARE

01:58.041 --> 02:00.375
TO YOUR FIND
IN ROCHESTER IN 2008?

02:01.959 --> 02:04.417
WELL, I'D SAY THIS ONE
IS MUCH BETTER.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.166

WANTED TO DIG AROUND
IN THERE MY WHOLE LIFE,

02:47.291 --> 02:48.542
BUT THE OWNERS
WON'T ALLOW IT.

02:48.625 --> 02:49.834
WELL, I'M
WORKING ON A DEAL

02:49.917 --> 02:51.500
THAT WOULD ALLOW
THE STATE TO PURCHASE IT

02:51.583 --> 02:52.834
THROUGH THE TRUST.

REVEAL IT NEXT WEEK.

TO GO ABOUT IT.

-YOU KNOW HIM?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.166

03:13.250 --> 03:14.250
HE'S A BIT
OF AN ECCENTRIC.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.667
THAT'S A VERY NICE WORD
FOR WHAT HE IS.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.250
AND THERE'S
ANOTHER THING.

03:18.333 --> 03:21.125

03:21.208 --> 03:22.875

03:35.000 --> 03:36.583
HAVE YOU CALLED THE POLICE?

03:36.667 --> 03:38.250
YEAH, I LET THE SHERIFF KNOW,
AND HE'S INVESTIGATING IT,

03:38.333 --> 03:40.583
BUT WHAT WOULD REALLY
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER

03:40.667 --> 03:42.709
IS IF I HAD AN ARCHEOLOGIST
ON-SITE I COULD TRUST.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.250

VERY WRONG

IT'S PRETTY SPOOKY,
THOUGH, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT.

04:39.834 --> 04:42.458
"SPOOKY" IS NOT A TERM

A LOT IN TOURISM!

AROUND AT THE SOLARIUM,

OF THE CASTLE?

06:10.834 --> 06:12.166
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

06:12.250 --> 06:13.250
THE CASTLE WAS BUILT

06:13.333 --> 06:15.750
BY CORVUS CHANDLER
IN 1867,

06:15.834 --> 06:17.333
BUT THE CHANDLERS
HAVE OWNED THIS LAND

06:17.417 --> 06:19.500
FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL.

ANCESTRAL HOME.

06:25.875 --> 06:26.959
THERE HE IS.

THOUGH CORVUS
IS LONG DEAD,

06:29.917 --> 06:31.917
HIS SPIRIT LIVES ON
IN THIS HOUSE.

OF THE OLD HOUSE,

CORVUS TORE IT DOWN

06:46.333 --> 06:48.875
AND BUILT THIS CASTLE
IN IMITATION

06:48.959 --> 06:51.000
OF THE WALTER SCOTT BOOKS
HE'D LOVED IN HIS YOUTH.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.291
HE--

06:52.375 --> 06:54.375
HE'S NOT TELLING YOU
THAT SILLY STORY, IS HE?

06:54.458 --> 06:56.291
YOU KNOW, OLD MAN CORVUS

06:56.375 --> 06:58.875
HE NEVER READ A BOOK
IN HIS LIFE.

06:58.959 --> 07:01.041

EXPECTING INDIANA JONES.

WHICH ONE WAS IT?

LANDSCAPE

07:41.250 --> 07:42.834
FROM THE HUDSON
RIVER SCHOOL.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.458
OOH, THAT SOUNDS PRICEY.

07:44.542 --> 07:47.333
YEAH, ANOTHER CHURCH
WENT FOR ABOUT $80,000

07:47.417 --> 07:48.625
LAST YEAR
AT AN AUCTION.

HAVE BEEN STOLEN?

07:50.417 --> 07:52.333

BUT WITH THE FULPER
POTTERY PIECES MISSING,

MY DISCOVERIES.

08:46.625 --> 08:47.583
THESE ARE JUST FRAGMENTS

YOU CAN LEARN A LOT
FROM GARBAGE.

I HAVE MORE SIGNIFICANT
FINDS ELSEWHERE.

08:56.959 --> 08:59.000
YOU GONNA
SHARE THEM WITH ME?

08:59.083 --> 09:02.125
IN TIME. I NEED TO KEEP THEM
OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE FOOLS.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.875

09:03.959 --> 09:05.542
THEM.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.333
BRAY CHANDLER--

IN HOW MUCH MONEY HE CAN MAKE.

PERRY QUINN,

09:10.834 --> 09:12.083

49:14.500 --> 49:17.750
WELL, NO, BUT HE WAS
THE LIFE'S BLOOD OF THIS HOUSE.

49:17.834 --> 49:19.667
HE DID HIS BEST
TO MAINTAIN IT.

49:19.750 --> 49:21.417
HE WAS TRYING
TO TELL US SOMETHING,

49:21.500 --> 49:22.750
AND I THINK
IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING

49:22.834 --> 49:24.125
TO DO WITH
BRAY'S FATHER'S DEATH.

49:24.208 --> 49:26.291
WELL, IT WAS SUDDEN.

49:26.375 --> 49:28.583
AND SUSPICIOUS.

49:30.041 --> 49:33.125
SHERMAN BELIEVED THAT, UH,
BRAY MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED.

49:33.208 --> 49:34.583
-BRAY?
-MM-HMM.

49:34.667 --> 49:36.291

HEY, MR. PEREZ.
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

50:50.166 --> 50:51.625
AGENT CONNER. YES.

50:51.709 --> 50:54.041
IT'S ABOUT
WALDON CHANDLER'S DEATH.

50:54.125 --> 50:55.041
OLD MAN CHANDLER?

50:55.125 --> 50:56.125
YEAH.

50:56.208 --> 50:57.875
THAT WAS
THREE YEARS AGO.

50:57.959 --> 50:59.959
FOUND IN THE WOODS
BEHIND THE CASTLE,

51:00.041 --> 51:01.041
DIED FROM
A FRACTURED SKULL.

51:01.125 --> 51:02.500
FRACTURED
FROM A FALL?

51:02.583 --> 51:04.083
POSSIBLY. I CAN'T SAY
HOW THE BLOW HAPPENED,

51:04.166 --> 51:05.375
ONLY THAT
IT KILLED HIM.

51:05.458 --> 51:06.875
COULD HE HAVE SUSTAINED
THE BLOW BEFORE HE FELL?

51:06.959 --> 51:08.250
MAYBE,
BUT HE WAS OLD.

51:08.333 --> 51:09.291
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON
FOR THE ELDERLY

51:09.375 --> 51:10.250
TO HAVE A FATAL FALL.

51:10.333 --> 51:11.417
BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE?

51:11.500 --> 51:12.500
WELL, I'M NOT
A DETECTIVE,

51:12.583 --> 51:13.917
THAT'S YOUR JOB.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.959
HOW DID BRAY CHANDLER
REACT TO IT?

51:16.041 --> 51:17.583
HE SAID...

51:17.667 --> 51:19.417
"IT MUST HAVE
BEEN HIS TIME."

51:19.500 --> 51:21.625
THAT'S NOT MUCH
OF A REACTION.

51:22.875 --> 51:24.000
AFTER YEARS
OF BEING AWAY,

51:24.083 --> 51:25.083
BRAY SHOWED UP

51:25.166 --> 51:26.625
THE DAY AFTER
HIS FATHER'S DEATH.

51:26.709 --> 51:27.917
HE ARRIVED JUST IN TIME

51:28.000 --> 51:30.750
TO TAKE OVER THE CASTLE
AND HIS INHERITANCE.

51:30.834 --> 51:32.709
AND YOU THINK
THAT'S SUSPICIOUS?

51:32.792 --> 51:34.959
WELL, AS I SAID,
I'M NOT A DETECTIVE,

51:35.041 --> 51:37.166
BUT IF WALDON WAS KILLED...

51:37.250 --> 51:39.458
BRAY CHANDLER
WOULD BE THE PRIME SUSPECT.

51:39.542 --> 51:41.250
HE'D HAVE PLENTY OF REASON
TO KILL WEBSTER AND SHERMAN,

51:41.333 --> 51:43.000
TO KEEP THEM QUIET.

51:43.083 --> 51:45.834
SEE? THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD
I'M NOT A DETECTIVE.

51:45.917 --> 51:48.291
WELL, AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T
BLAME THE CHANDLER CURSE.

51:48.375 --> 51:50.208
WELL, I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT.

51:50.291 --> 51:52.083

THAT BURNED DOWN

51:55.166 --> 51:56.375
IT KILLED

51:56.458 --> 51:57.500
AND CORVUS HIMSELF

OKAY, ABIGAIL WAS IN
SAMUEL CHANDLER'S EMPLOY

52:22.500 --> 52:25.375
IN 1689.

52:25.458 --> 52:29.750
SAMUEL ACCUSED HER
OF WITCHCRAFT.

52:29.834 --> 52:34.166
SHE VOWED REVENGE ON HIM
AND THE ENTIRE CHANDLER FAMILY.

52:34.250 --> 52:38.000
SHE CALLED ON
THE STONE-THROWING SPIRIT

52:38.083 --> 52:39.625
TO DO HER BIDDING, AND...

52:39.709 --> 52:41.291
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

-IT'S SO DRAMATIC!

52:49.500 --> 52:51.417

IN NEW ENGLAND.

52:51.500 --> 52:52.375

58:06.750 --> 58:08.500
I NEED TO DO
SOME MORE DIGGING.

58:08.583 --> 58:11.542
DO YOU THINK EVERYTHING
IN THE HIDDEN CHAMBER'S A FRAUD?

58:11.625 --> 58:13.375
I CAN'T SAY YET.
MAYBE SOME OF IT'S REAL.

58:13.458 --> 58:14.750
DEFINITELY NOT ALL.

58:14.834 --> 58:18.250
WHO'S CAPABLE OF PULLING OFF
A HOAX LIKE THAT?

58:18.333 --> 58:19.875
WEBSTER.

58:19.959 --> 58:22.000
WEBSTER?
WHY WOULD HE DO IT?

58:22.083 --> 58:24.917
UH, FAME? ATTENTION? MONEY?

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY
IN ARCHEOLOGY?

58:27.083 --> 58:29.166
THERE'S A MARKET
FOR ANYTHING RARE.

58:31.583 --> 58:33.792
IT'S TIME FOR US TO VISIT
AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE.

58:35.041 --> 58:36.000
OKAY.

58:44.583 --> 58:45.458
[DOOR BELL JANGLES]

58:45.542 --> 58:46.583
JUST A MINUTE.

58:46.667 --> 58:48.291
JUST A MINUTE.

58:48.375 --> 58:50.208
[GRUMBLES]

58:50.291 --> 58:51.709
YOU AGAIN.

58:51.792 --> 58:53.166
HEY, TRAP.
HOW YOU DOING?

58:53.250 --> 58:54.083
WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY FRIEND,

58:54.166 --> 58:56.041
PROFESSOR EMMA FIELDING.

58:56.125 --> 58:57.041
WE CAME BY

58:57.125 --> 58:58.875
TO TAKE A LOOK AT
THAT MERCHANDISE

58:58.959 --> 59:00.583
YOU'RE HOLDING FOR ME
IN THE BACK.

59:00.667 --> 59:02.542
BE MY GUEST.

59:06.500 --> 59:08.625
SO, UH...

59:08.709 --> 59:11.291
YOU'RE SURE THAT THIS IS THE GUY
THAT BROUGHT THIS STUFF IN?

59:11.375 --> 59:13.417
THAT'S HIM, ALL RIGHT.

59:13.500 --> 59:15.583
YEAH? NOT HIM?

59:15.667 --> 59:18.333
NOPE. NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE.

59:19.625 --> 59:20.709
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

59:20.792 --> 59:22.500
PROFESSOR WEBSTER?

59:22.583 --> 59:25.875
NOPE. HAVEN'T DONE BUSINESS
WITH HIM IN A WHILE.

59:25.959 --> 59:27.250
YOU KNOW
PROFESSOR WEBSTER?

59:28.959 --> 59:30.750
KNEW HIM.

59:30.834 --> 59:32.000
HE DIED.
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

59:32.083 --> 59:33.166
[CONNER]: YEAH. WE HEARD.

59:33.250 --> 59:35.542
HOW WERE YOU
ACQUAINTED WITH HIM?

59:35.625 --> 59:37.792
WELL, I DON'T JUST DEAL
WITH STOLEN GOODS, YOU KNOW.

59:37.875 --> 59:39.417
I'M ALSO
A LEGITIMATE BUSINESSMAN,

59:39.500 --> 59:40.333
WITH SEVERAL
LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES.

59:40.417 --> 59:43.041
SUCH AS?

59:43.125 --> 59:44.709
I BROKER DEALS.

59:44.792 --> 59:46.041
WHAT KIND OF DEALS?

59:47.583 --> 59:50.083
BETWEEN PEOPLE
WHO HAVE INTERESTING ITEMS

59:50.166 --> 59:52.041
AND PEOPLE WHO WANT
INTERESTING ITEMS.

59:52.125 --> 59:53.500
IT'S ALL LEGAL
AND ABOVE-BOARD.

59:53.583 --> 59:54.959
AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WAS.

59:55.041 --> 59:56.709
OH, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO EXPLAIN THAT.

59:58.709 --> 1:00:01.625
THE PROFESSOR WOULD SUPPLY ME
WITH HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS

1:00:01.709 --> 1:00:02.875
THAT HAD...

1:00:02.959 --> 1:00:04.291
QUESTIONABLE PROVENANCE

1:00:04.375 --> 1:00:06.458
FOR A SELECT CLIENTELE.

1:00:06.542 --> 1:00:08.750
ARTICLES STOLEN FROM MUSEUMS?

1:00:08.834 --> 1:00:10.792
I DON'T ASK
WHERE THEY'RE FROM.

1:00:10.875 --> 1:00:13.375
I'M JUST WHAT YOU WOULD CALL
A CONDUIT

1:00:13.458 --> 1:00:16.041
FOR CERTAIN WEALTHY PEOPLE
WITH A TASTE FOR HISTORY.

1:00:16.125 --> 1:00:18.959
WHAT WENT WRONG?

1:00:19.041 --> 1:00:20.667
WELL, MAYBE YOU BETTER TALK
TO VICTOR BRADFORD.

1:00:23.125 --> 1:00:25.667
VICTOR BRADFORD.

1:00:25.750 --> 1:00:28.792
[♪♪]

1:00:37.500 --> 1:00:39.333
WOW...

1:00:39.417 --> 1:00:42.709
[CONNER]:
YEAH. WOW.

1:00:42.792 --> 1:00:46.125
SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION.

1:00:46.208 --> 1:00:48.667
YEAH, SOME OF THESE THINGS
SHOULD BE IN A MUSEUM.

1:00:48.750 --> 1:00:51.208
REALLY. THEY SHOULD
BE IN A MUSEUM.

1:00:51.291 --> 1:00:53.458
YES. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT.

1:00:53.542 --> 1:00:54.917
SEBASTIAN TELLS ME

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.166
YOU'RE SOMEONE
I'D VERY MUCH LIKE TO MEET.

1:00:57.250 --> 1:00:58.583
WAS HE RIGHT?

1:00:58.667 --> 1:00:59.709
EMMA FIELDING.

1:00:59.792 --> 1:01:00.917
PROFESSOR FIELDING!
YES, OF COURSE!

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:02.250
UH, WELL, I HAVE

1:01:02.333 --> 1:01:04.041
FOLLOWED YOUR WORK SOMEWHAT
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.

1:01:04.125 --> 1:01:06.834
IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME
TO SHARE MY TREASURES

1:01:06.917 --> 1:01:08.041
WITH A SCHOLAR
OF YOUR RENOWN.

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:10.417
PLEASE, ALLOW ME
TO SHOW YOU MY COLLECTION.

1:01:12.208 --> 1:01:13.250
[HUSHED]:
THAT'S HIM.

1:01:13.333 --> 1:01:14.417
WHO?

1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:15.834
THE GUY WHO WAS
FIGHTING WITH WEBSTER

1:01:15.917 --> 1:01:17.750
THE DAY
HE WAS KILLED.

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.792
[VICTOR]:
NOW, THESE ARE MARVELS.

1:01:26.875 --> 1:01:29.542
AN ACTUAL PIECE OF
THE MAYFLOWER'S FIGUREHEAD.

1:01:29.625 --> 1:01:32.750
A SET OF PAUL REVERE SPOONS.

1:01:32.834 --> 1:01:35.375
AND A SADDLE ONCE OWNED
BY GEORGE WASHINGTON.

1:01:35.458 --> 1:01:37.458
TREASURES
OF AMERICAN HISTORY.

1:01:37.542 --> 1:01:39.792
WELL, SEBASTIAN SAID YOU HAD
A REMARKABLE COLLECTION.

1:01:39.875 --> 1:01:42.959
YES, WELL, SEBASTIAN'S NOT
THE MOST RELIABLE SOURCE,

1:01:43.041 --> 1:01:44.250
BUT HE HAS HIS EAR
TO THE GROUND.

1:01:44.333 --> 1:01:46.041
HE TIPPED ME OFF
TO MANY OF THE ITEMS

1:01:46.125 --> 1:01:47.000
I'VE COLLECTED
OVER THE YEARS.

1:01:47.083 --> 1:01:49.041
WHAT ABOUT THOMAS WEBSTER?

1:01:49.125 --> 1:01:51.792
OH... PROFESSOR WEBSTER.

1:01:51.875 --> 1:01:53.458
TERRIBLE THING THAT WAS.

1:01:53.542 --> 1:01:55.333
-MM-HMM.
-TERRIBLE.

1:01:55.417 --> 1:01:58.000
BUT YES, HE HIMSELF SUPPLIED ME

1:01:58.083 --> 1:01:59.917
WITH MANY LOVELY PIECES
OVER THE YEARS.

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.875
A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP.

1:02:01.959 --> 1:02:04.667
WHY DID YOU HAVE A FIGHT
WITH HIM THE OTHER DAY?

1:02:04.750 --> 1:02:05.750
THE OTHER DAY?

1:02:05.834 --> 1:02:06.709
MM-HMM.

1:02:06.792 --> 1:02:07.667
I DIDN'T.

1:02:07.750 --> 1:02:09.166
[EMMA]: YOU DID.

1:02:09.250 --> 1:02:11.166
I'M THE ONE YOU RAN INTO
AT CHANDLER CASTLE.

1:02:11.250 --> 1:02:13.667
OH.

1:02:13.750 --> 1:02:15.542
OH, YES.
OF COURSE.

1:02:15.625 --> 1:02:16.875
WELL, YOU SEE, THE THING IS,

1:02:16.959 --> 1:02:18.917
WEBSTER WAS A BIT OF
A PRICKLY FELLOW,

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.375
AND ONE WAS BOUND TO HAVE

1:02:20.458 --> 1:02:22.667
THE OCCASIONAL ALTERCATION
WITH HIM, FROM TIME TO TIME.

1:02:22.750 --> 1:02:24.333
IT WAS NOTHING SERIOUS.

1:02:28.542 --> 1:02:31.041
[EMMA]: WHAT'S THAT?

1:02:32.750 --> 1:02:35.375
OH! THAT'S... NOTHING.
NOTHING AT ALL.

1:02:35.458 --> 1:02:37.125
NOTHING OF NOTE.

1:02:37.208 --> 1:02:39.083
I'M STILL WAITING ON
THE AUTHENTICATION.

1:02:39.166 --> 1:02:41.417
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING CHEAP
THAT I PICKED UP.

1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:42.750
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING.

1:02:42.834 --> 1:02:45.250
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE NOTHING.

1:02:45.333 --> 1:02:46.750
I'M SORRY,

1:02:46.834 --> 1:02:49.500
I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR CREDENTIALS
EARLIER. MISTER...?

1:02:49.583 --> 1:02:51.333
I'M JIM CONNER. FBI.

1:02:51.417 --> 1:02:52.542
ANTIQUITIES DIVISION.

1:02:52.625 --> 1:02:54.625
BUT DON'T WORRY.

1:02:54.709 --> 1:02:57.417
THIS ISN'T
AN OFFICIAL VISIT.

1:03:04.375 --> 1:03:06.417
YOU EAT LIKE THAT
ALL THE TIME?

1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:07.500
YEAH, EVERY
CHANCE I GET.

1:03:07.583 --> 1:03:08.583
WHAT, DO YOU

1:03:08.667 --> 1:03:10.250
ONLY EAT SALAD
AND VEGETABLES?

1:03:10.333 --> 1:03:11.542
[EMMA]: MM-HMM.
YEAH. IT'S HEALTHY.

1:03:11.625 --> 1:03:12.625
MM-HMM.

1:03:14.500 --> 1:03:15.667
LIFE'S TOO SHORT.

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:18.250
YEAH, IT IS
IF YOU EAT LIKE THAT.

1:03:20.458 --> 1:03:23.166
SO... WHAT DO
WE KNOW SO FAR?

1:03:23.250 --> 1:03:26.875
OKAY. LET'S START
WITH BRAY CHANDLER.

1:03:26.959 --> 1:03:29.375
OKAY. WE KNOW
HE'S BEEN STEALING

1:03:29.458 --> 1:03:31.125
HIS OWN PRICELESS
POSSESSIONS.

1:03:31.208 --> 1:03:32.500
-MM-HMM.
-WHY?

1:03:32.583 --> 1:03:33.792
YOU TELL ME.

1:03:33.875 --> 1:03:35.291
UH, WELL...

1:03:35.375 --> 1:03:36.667
HE'S FENCING THEM

1:03:36.750 --> 1:03:38.291
AND COLLECTING
THE INSURANCE.

1:03:38.375 --> 1:03:39.792
TWO FOR
THE PRICE OF ONE.

1:03:39.875 --> 1:03:42.166
DOUBLE-DIPPING. WHY?

1:03:42.250 --> 1:03:43.333
BECAUSE
HE NEEDS THE MONEY.

1:03:43.417 --> 1:03:45.083
HE SPENT
HIS INHERITANCE.

1:03:45.166 --> 1:03:46.959
OKAY. WHAT ABOUT
VICTOR BRADFORD?

1:03:47.041 --> 1:03:48.083
WELL...

1:03:48.166 --> 1:03:49.834
HE'S DEFINITELY
HIDING SOMETHING.

1:03:49.917 --> 1:03:51.875
YEAH. WE CAN
AGREE ON THAT.

1:03:51.959 --> 1:03:53.125
MM! THE DOCUMENTS--

1:03:53.208 --> 1:03:55.333
I DIDN'T GET A VERY
GOOD LOOK AT THEM,

1:03:55.417 --> 1:03:56.500
BUT THEY LOOKED
LIKE THEY WERE

1:03:56.583 --> 1:03:59.166
MID-17TH CENTURY,
ANGLO-AMERICAN.

1:03:59.250 --> 1:04:01.291
CERTAINLY
WASN'T "NOTHING".

1:04:01.375 --> 1:04:02.792
MM-MM. AND IT WAS
IN A SHIPPING TUBE,

1:04:02.875 --> 1:04:04.792
LIKE HE'D JUST GOTTEN
IT BACK FROM SOMEWHERE.

1:04:04.875 --> 1:04:05.834
HE SAID HE WAS GETTING
IT AUTHENTICATED.

1:04:05.917 --> 1:04:07.083
MM-HMM.

1:04:07.166 --> 1:04:08.959
IF YOU HAD A MID-17TH
ANGLO-AMERICAN DOCUMENT,

1:04:09.041 --> 1:04:10.542
WHO WOULD YOU GO TO?

1:04:12.041 --> 1:04:13.834
PROFESSOR RAYMOND HOPLEY
AT HARVARD.

1:04:13.917 --> 1:04:15.583
HE'S CONSIDERED THE EXPERT.

1:04:17.625 --> 1:04:19.041
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

1:04:19.125 --> 1:04:20.709
I'M CALLING HARVARD.

1:04:20.792 --> 1:04:21.875
PROFESSOR HOPLEY.

1:04:21.959 --> 1:04:24.333
YOU CAN'T
JUST CALL HARVARD.

1:04:24.417 --> 1:04:26.208
THESE ARE BUSY PEOPLE.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

1:04:26.291 --> 1:04:28.125
WHAT, DO YOU HAVE
HARVARD ON SPEED DIAL?

1:04:28.208 --> 1:04:30.041
HI. THIS IS
AGENT JIM CONNER FROM THE FBI.

1:04:30.125 --> 1:04:32.208
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO A PROFESSOR RAYMOND HOPLEY.

1:04:32.291 --> 1:04:36.208
UH-HUH. URGENT MATTER, YES.
THANK YOU.

1:04:36.291 --> 1:04:39.041
OR YOU COULD JUST...
DO THAT.

1:04:39.125 --> 1:04:40.959
[WHISPERS]: IT'S THE FBI.

1:04:42.792 --> 1:04:44.458
UH, HELLO,
PROFESSOR HOPLEY.

1:04:44.542 --> 1:04:46.458
I BELIEVE YOU MAY HAVE
AUTHENTICATED

1:04:46.542 --> 1:04:49.000
A DOCUMENT FOR
A MR. VICTOR BRADFORD.

1:04:50.208 --> 1:04:51.709
OH, IT WAS A FORGERY?

1:04:51.792 --> 1:04:55.583
CAN YOU FILL ME IN
ON THE DETAILS, PROFESSOR?

1:04:55.667 --> 1:04:57.041
[DOORBELL CHIMING]

1:04:59.083 --> 1:05:01.083
AH, ONE MORE THING,
MR. BRADFORD.

1:05:01.166 --> 1:05:02.458
AND THIS TIME...

1:05:02.542 --> 1:05:04.250
IT IS AN OFFICIAL VISIT.

1:05:06.959 --> 1:05:08.583
THIS WAS TO HAVE BEEN

1:05:08.667 --> 1:05:10.417
THE CORNERSTONE
OF MY COLLECTION.

1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:12.625
MY PRIZE POSSESSION.

1:05:12.709 --> 1:05:14.667
THE FOUNDING DOCUMENT

1:05:14.750 --> 1:05:17.125
OF AMERICAN GOVERNANCE.

1:05:17.208 --> 1:05:18.875
THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT.

1:05:18.959 --> 1:05:20.375
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

1:05:20.458 --> 1:05:22.583
THERE ARE NO ORIGINAL COPIES
OF THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT.

1:05:22.667 --> 1:05:23.750
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT,

1:05:23.834 --> 1:05:25.750
UNTIL THOMAS WEBSTER
CONVINCED ME OTHERWISE

1:05:25.834 --> 1:05:26.792
LAST YEAR,

1:05:26.875 --> 1:05:28.792
TO THE TUNE
OF $100,000.

1:05:28.875 --> 1:05:30.959
I SIMPLY HAD TO HAVE IT.

1:05:31.041 --> 1:05:32.041
BUT IT'S FAKE.

1:05:32.125 --> 1:05:33.083
HOW DO
YOU KNOW THAT?

1:05:33.166 --> 1:05:35.041
WELL, IF IT WAS FOUND,

1:05:35.125 --> 1:05:37.625
THE NEWSFEEDS WOULD BE
BLOWING UP ALL OVER AMERICA.

1:05:37.709 --> 1:05:38.834
YOU COULDN'T KEEP IT QUIET.

1:05:38.917 --> 1:05:40.792
IT'S TOO BIG A PART
OF AMERICAN HISTORY.

1:05:40.875 --> 1:05:44.000
YOU SEE, I WANTED
TO BELIEVE SO BADLY,

1:05:44.083 --> 1:05:46.417
I ALLOWED MY HEART
TO RUN AWAY WITH MY HEAD.

1:05:46.500 --> 1:05:49.417
MY ANCESTORS CAME OVER
ON THE MAYFLOWER.

1:05:49.500 --> 1:05:51.750
I'M A DIRECT DESCENDANT
OF WILLIAM BRADFORD,

1:05:51.834 --> 1:05:53.333
AND TO OWN A DOCUMENT LIKE THIS

1:05:53.417 --> 1:05:55.709
WOULD BE LIKE CLOSING
A CIRCLE OF HERITAGE

1:05:55.792 --> 1:05:57.000
FOR MY FAMILY.

1:05:57.083 --> 1:05:58.792
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE
HAD IT AUTHENTICATED.

1:05:58.875 --> 1:06:01.041
YES, OF COURSE,
BY EXPERTS.

1:06:01.125 --> 1:06:03.291
I HAD THE PARCHMENT ANALYZED,
I HAD THE INK EVALUATED,

1:06:03.375 --> 1:06:05.041
BY ONE OF THE NATIONS'S
LEADING AUTHORITIES.

1:06:05.125 --> 1:06:06.792
IT ALL CHECKED OUT.

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:11.917
AND THEN, ABOUT A YEAR
AFTER I BOUGHT IT...

1:06:13.333 --> 1:06:14.333
[EMMA GASPS]

1:06:14.417 --> 1:06:15.500
[VICTOR]:
...THE INK STARTED TO RUN.

1:06:15.583 --> 1:06:16.417
[EMMA]: OH...

1:06:16.500 --> 1:06:18.041
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

1:06:18.125 --> 1:06:22.041
AFTER ALMOST 400 YEARS,
THE INK NOW STARTS TO RUN?

1:06:22.125 --> 1:06:25.333
SO I HAD ANOTHER AUTHORITY
ANALYZE IT.

1:06:25.417 --> 1:06:26.291
THAT'S PROFESSOR HOPLEY
AT HARVARD?

1:06:26.375 --> 1:06:27.875
YES, THAT'S RIGHT,

1:06:27.959 --> 1:06:29.625
AND HE HAD
A MUCH DIFFERENT ANSWER.

1:06:29.709 --> 1:06:33.083
THE INK CONTAINED OILS
NATIVE ONLY TO SOUTH AMERICA.

1:06:33.166 --> 1:06:35.458
THE PARCHMENT
HAD BEEN AGED ARTIFICIALLY.

1:06:35.542 --> 1:06:36.709
[HE TAKES A DEEP BREATH]

1:06:36.792 --> 1:06:39.583
IT WAS NOT
THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT.

1:06:39.667 --> 1:06:41.208
I'D BEEN HAD.

1:06:41.291 --> 1:06:43.083
HOW DID THE FIRST EXPERTS
GET IT SO WRONG?

1:06:43.166 --> 1:06:44.834
MAYBE BECAUSE

1:06:44.917 --> 1:06:47.333
THE FIRST SET OF EXPERTS
SPLIT THE MONEY WITH WEBSTER.

1:06:47.417 --> 1:06:49.834
WHY DIDN'T YOU REPORT
THAT TO THE POLICE?

1:06:51.959 --> 1:06:54.000
BECAUSE YOU WERE
TOO HUMILIATED.

1:06:54.083 --> 1:06:57.208
TO BE TAKEN IN
BY SUCH AN OBVIOUS FRAUD?

1:06:57.291 --> 1:06:59.750
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN
A LAUGHINGSTOCK.

1:06:59.834 --> 1:07:01.917
I PREFERRED
TO HANDLE THIS MORE QUIETLY,

1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:03.458
SO I WENT TO PROFESSOR WEBSTER,
I DEMANDED

1:07:03.542 --> 1:07:04.834
THAT HE RETURN THE MONEY
TO ME,

1:07:04.917 --> 1:07:06.208
BUT HE LAUGHED.

1:07:06.291 --> 1:07:08.667
SO, I GAVE HIM AN ULTIMATUM.

1:07:08.750 --> 1:07:10.542
I TOLD HIM EITHER HE WOULD
HAVE THE MONEY FOR ME

1:07:10.625 --> 1:07:12.875
BY THE END OF THE WEEK,
OR THERE WOULD BE HELL TO PAY.

1:07:12.959 --> 1:07:14.375
THE END OF THE WEEK
CAME AROUND,

1:07:14.458 --> 1:07:15.959
AND HE HAD NOTHING,

1:07:16.041 --> 1:07:17.208
AND HE DIDN'T CARE.

1:07:17.291 --> 1:07:19.083
HE CHALLENGED ME
TO GO TO THE AUTHORITIES

1:07:19.166 --> 1:07:20.333
SO THAT I WOULD
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

1:07:20.417 --> 1:07:21.625
YOU WERE ANGRY.

1:07:21.709 --> 1:07:24.458
YES, I WAS.

1:07:26.542 --> 1:07:28.333
ANGRY ENOUGH TO KILL HIM?

1:07:28.417 --> 1:07:30.166
[EXHALES SOFTLY]

1:07:30.250 --> 1:07:32.166
OF COURSE NOT.

1:07:33.375 --> 1:07:35.500
[♪♪]

1:07:45.792 --> 1:07:47.667
WHY DIDN'T YOU
ARREST BRADFORD?

1:07:47.750 --> 1:07:48.917
DIDN'T YOU
SEE HIS EYES?

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:49.917
WHAT,
KILLER EYES?

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:51.041
YES!

1:07:51.125 --> 1:07:52.250
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,

1:07:52.333 --> 1:07:53.542
THERE'S NO FOOLPROOF
OPHTHALMOLOGICAL METHOD

1:07:53.625 --> 1:07:55.000
OF SPOTTING MURDERERS.

1:07:55.083 --> 1:07:56.500
BESIDES, HE CLAIMED
HE WAS AT AN ESTATE SALE

1:07:56.583 --> 1:07:57.917
WHEN THE MURDER
WAS HAPPENED,

1:07:58.000 --> 1:07:59.375
SO I THINK I SHOULD
GO LOOK INTO THAT.

1:07:59.458 --> 1:08:00.542
CORROBORATE HIS ALIBI?

1:08:00.625 --> 1:08:02.333
AH-HAH! NOW
YOU'RE LEARNING.

1:08:02.417 --> 1:08:03.792
PURSUE ALL AVENUES

1:08:03.875 --> 1:08:05.333
UNTIL ONE OF THEM
LEADS TO THE TRUTH.

1:08:05.417 --> 1:08:07.166
BUT WHAT ELSE DOES

1:08:07.250 --> 1:08:09.458
BRADFORD'S STORY
TELL US?

1:08:09.542 --> 1:08:11.959
OKAY, WEBSTER WAS
A SCAM ARTIST.

1:08:12.041 --> 1:08:13.959
AND THE HOAX
AT CHANDLER CASTLE

1:08:14.041 --> 1:08:15.458
WAS ONE OF HIS SCAMS.

1:08:15.542 --> 1:08:16.750
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE HIM MONEY?

1:08:16.834 --> 1:08:18.542
IT WOULDN'T.

1:08:18.625 --> 1:08:21.458
UNLESS SOMEONE WAS
PAYING HIM TO DO IT.

1:08:21.542 --> 1:08:23.875
WELL, BUT-- BUT IF HE MADE
ALL THAT MONEY CONNING BRADFORD,

1:08:23.959 --> 1:08:25.375
WHY WOULD HE NEED MORE?

1:08:25.458 --> 1:08:27.208
TRUST ME. THE ONE THING
I UNDERSTAND AS AN FBI AGENT,

1:08:27.291 --> 1:08:28.834
PEOPLE DON'T COMMIT CRIMES
'CAUSE THEY NEED MONEY,

1:08:28.917 --> 1:08:30.333
THEY COMMIT CRIMES
BECAUSE THEY WANT MORE.

1:08:31.500 --> 1:08:33.000
SO, TELL ME.

1:08:33.083 --> 1:08:34.917
WHO WOULD PAY WEBSTER
TO CREATE THE HOAX?

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.667
UH, BRAY CHANDLER.
HE WAS BROKE.

1:08:37.750 --> 1:08:38.875
TOTALLY OUT OF MONEY.

1:08:38.959 --> 1:08:40.917
HE'S SELLING THE CASTLE
TO THE TRUST,

1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.166
AND HE NEEDED IT
TO BE MORE VALUABLE,

1:08:43.250 --> 1:08:44.458
SO HE COULD CHARGE
MORE MONEY.

1:08:44.542 --> 1:08:45.834
BUT IF BRAY
HAD NO MONEY,

1:08:45.917 --> 1:08:46.792
THEN HOW WOULD
HE PAY WEBSTER?

1:08:46.875 --> 1:08:47.875
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S WHY

1:08:47.959 --> 1:08:49.041
HE WAS SELLING OFF
ALL HIS ANTIQUITIES.

1:08:49.166 --> 1:08:51.041
WHY DO YOU GET TO ASK
ALL THE QUESTIONS?

1:08:51.125 --> 1:08:53.542
BECAUSE I'M THE FBI.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:57.375
BESIDES, I LIKE
THE WAY YOU THINK.

1:08:57.458 --> 1:08:59.083
THANK YOU.

1:08:59.166 --> 1:09:00.917
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
FOR ME,

1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.000
JUST GO AHEAD.

1:09:02.083 --> 1:09:03.458
-ANY QUESTION?
-MM-HMM.

1:09:03.542 --> 1:09:04.875
WELL, WITHIN REASON.

1:09:04.959 --> 1:09:06.667
HOW'D YOU GET SHOT?

1:09:08.792 --> 1:09:10.917
[LAUGHS]

1:09:20.667 --> 1:09:24.333
I WAS, UH, INVESTIGATING
A COUNTERFEITING RING.

1:09:26.166 --> 1:09:28.625
I GOT MYSELF CORNERED
IN THIS OLD WAREHOUSE

1:09:28.709 --> 1:09:30.333
WITH SOME CRIMINALS.

1:09:30.417 --> 1:09:33.250
BUT MY CONTACT
WAS A FEDERAL AGENT

1:09:33.333 --> 1:09:35.208
WHO WAS UNDERCOVER
WITH THE GANG.

1:09:36.709 --> 1:09:38.667
YOU REALLY DO
THAT SORT OF THING?

1:09:38.750 --> 1:09:41.125
YEAH. ALL THE TIME.

1:09:42.333 --> 1:09:45.000
ANYWAY...

1:09:45.083 --> 1:09:46.667
SHE INTERVENED
TO HELP ME,

1:09:46.750 --> 1:09:48.041
AND BLEW HER COVER.

1:09:48.125 --> 1:09:49.041
HER COVER?

1:09:50.750 --> 1:09:52.083
YOU GONNA LET ME FINISH?

1:09:52.166 --> 1:09:53.083
SORRY.

1:09:53.166 --> 1:09:54.291
SO,

1:09:54.375 --> 1:09:56.875
ANYWAY, THINGS GOT
PRETTY HAIRY FROM THERE.

1:09:56.959 --> 1:09:58.125
THERE WAS A LOT OF GUNFIRE.

1:09:58.208 --> 1:10:00.291
BUT IT WAS MY FAULT
THAT SHE BLEW HER COVER,

1:10:00.375 --> 1:10:02.875
SO I WAS NOT GONNA LET HER
TAKE A BULLET FOR THAT.

1:10:04.083 --> 1:10:05.709
SO YOU SAVED HER.

1:10:07.125 --> 1:10:10.000
YEAH. THE WAY I SEE IT,
SHE SAVED ME.

1:10:13.875 --> 1:10:15.917
ANY MORE QUESTIONS?

1:10:17.208 --> 1:10:18.125
NO.

1:10:18.208 --> 1:10:20.083
OH. GOOD.

1:10:20.166 --> 1:10:22.166
I'M GONNA GO CHECK OUT
BRADFORD'S ALIBI,

1:10:22.250 --> 1:10:24.166
SO YOU WANT ME TO DROP YOU OFF
AT THE CASTLE?

1:10:24.250 --> 1:10:25.792
[LAUGHS]

1:10:25.875 --> 1:10:28.000
ANOTHER QUESTION
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HEAR.

OH. MUST HAVE

OH, NO.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

IT'S A BAD THING,

BUT, WELL, AT LEAST
I MET YOU.

1:11:11.625 --> 1:11:15.917
OH. UH, CAN I HELP YOU
WITH ANYTHING ELSE?

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:17.375
OH, NO. I MEAN,

NOT UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN
VICTOR BRADFORD.

1:11:19.250 --> 1:11:20.667
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO MEET HIM HERE.

1:11:20.750 --> 1:11:22.208
OH, VICTOR. HE COMES
TO ALL THE ESTATE SALES,

1:11:22.291 --> 1:11:24.208
BUT HE WON'T BE HERE
UNTIL TOMORROW.

1:11:24.291 --> 1:11:25.375
AH, TOMORROW.

1:11:25.458 --> 1:11:26.917

LAST WEEKEND.

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.250
I MISSED HIM AT
THE ANDERSON ESTATE SALE.

1:11:28.333 --> 1:11:29.875
OH, WHAT A SHAME!

1:11:29.959 --> 1:11:31.625

LARGE PURCHASES.

1:11:31.709 --> 1:11:33.667
HE DID?
HE WAS THERE? OKAY.

1:11:35.333 --> 1:11:36.709
ALL RIGHT.

BRAY'S OUR MAN?

IT'S A THEORY.

HIS FATHER, TOO?

A TERRIBLE THOUGHT.

1:12:05.667 --> 1:12:06.834
IT IS.

1:12:06.917 --> 1:12:08.250
AND THEN HE WOULD'VE
HAD TO KILL SHERMAN

TO STOP HIM
FROM GIVING YOU PROOF.

1:12:09.750 --> 1:12:11.959

NO. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

HOW ABOUT SHERMAN ARLINGTON,
DID YOU KILL HIM, TOO?

1:12:43.583 --> 1:12:44.625
DID YOU KILL HIM?

OKAY, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

OKAY, I WANT YOU
OUT OF THIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

HER RESEARCH.

SUPPOSED TO ACCOMPLISH?

HE'LL SHOW HIS HAND.

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:07.375
WHAT IF HE'S INNOCENT?

1:13:07.458 --> 1:13:08.834

1:15:29.750 --> 1:15:31.291
-WHO?
-[LAUGHS] OH...

1:15:31.375 --> 1:15:33.917
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU.

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:35.917
YOU SUPPLIED THE ARTIFACTS,
DIDN'T YOU?

1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.250
FROM YOUR
ANCESTRAL HOME?

1:15:38.333 --> 1:15:40.625
OH. MY ANCESTORS
WEREN'T WITCHES.

1:15:40.709 --> 1:15:42.375
OF COURSE NOT!

1:15:42.458 --> 1:15:44.208
THAT'S WHY PROFESSOR WEBSTER

1:15:44.291 --> 1:15:46.125
HAD TO ADD ALL THE WRITING
ON THE WALL,

1:15:46.250 --> 1:15:48.959
AND ALTER THE ARTIFACTS,
JUST A LITTLE BIT,

1:15:49.041 --> 1:15:50.417
TO MAKE IT CONVINCING.

1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:53.000
OKAY, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

1:15:53.083 --> 1:15:54.917
ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T
DO A VERY GOOD JOB.

1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.917
THERE WAS A MARK
ON-- ON THE MORTAR.

1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.375
THE LETTER "Q" FOR QUINN.

1:16:00.458 --> 1:16:02.458
YOUR LAST NAME.

1:16:02.542 --> 1:16:06.333
WHY ON EARTH
WOULD I DO THAT?

1:16:06.417 --> 1:16:09.500
THAT'S WHAT
I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT.

1:16:09.583 --> 1:16:11.500
YOU WOULDN'T BENEFIT
FROM THE SALE

1:16:11.583 --> 1:16:13.458
OF THE CASTLE,

1:16:13.542 --> 1:16:16.500
OR FROM INCREASING THE VALUE
WITH THE HOAX.

1:16:16.583 --> 1:16:18.000
ONLY BRAY WOULD.

1:16:18.083 --> 1:16:19.083
THAT'S RIGHT.

1:16:19.166 --> 1:16:21.083
YEAH...

1:16:21.166 --> 1:16:23.375
AND THEN I GOT IT.

1:16:23.458 --> 1:16:25.750
YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH BRAY.

1:16:27.208 --> 1:16:28.667
YOU TRY TO HIDE IT,

1:16:28.750 --> 1:16:30.291
BUT IT EATS YOU UP INSIDE.

1:16:30.375 --> 1:16:31.458
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

1:16:31.542 --> 1:16:34.000
YOU KNEW THAT BRAY WAS
IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE,

1:16:34.083 --> 1:16:36.166
THAT HE WAS SELLING
HIS ANTIQUES

1:16:36.250 --> 1:16:37.959
AND SAYING THEY'D BEEN STOLEN.

1:16:39.709 --> 1:16:41.500
SO WHAT IF I KNEW?

1:16:41.583 --> 1:16:43.166
YOU THOUGHT,

1:16:43.250 --> 1:16:46.458
IF YOU ENGINEERED THE SALE
OF CHANDLER CASTLE,

1:16:46.542 --> 1:16:47.917
YOU COULD HELP BRAY,

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:50.333
AND IF YOU BUILT UP
THIS IDEA OF A CURSE,

1:16:50.417 --> 1:16:52.333
THEN YOU COULD
TURN THE CASTLE

1:16:52.417 --> 1:16:54.041
INTO A REAL TOURIST ATTRACTION,

1:16:54.125 --> 1:16:55.875
AND YOU COULD HELP BRAY,

1:16:55.959 --> 1:16:58.458
AND THEN BRAY
WOULD BE GRATEFUL,

1:16:58.542 --> 1:17:00.458
AND HE'D NOTICE YOU,

1:17:00.542 --> 1:17:02.458
AND YOU COULD WIN HIS HEART.

1:17:04.375 --> 1:17:07.083
OH, THAT'S...

1:17:07.166 --> 1:17:09.041
VERY ROMANTIC OF ME.

1:17:09.125 --> 1:17:11.291
DO YOU THINK SO?

1:17:11.375 --> 1:17:13.041
I THINK
IT'S KIND OF SAD.

1:17:13.125 --> 1:17:14.875
BESIDES,

1:17:14.959 --> 1:17:18.333
HOW COULD I GET
PROFESSOR WEBSTER TO HELP ME?

1:17:18.417 --> 1:17:20.792
OH, YOU OFFERED
TO PAY HIM.

1:17:20.875 --> 1:17:22.750
BUT THEN...

1:17:22.834 --> 1:17:25.500
I THINK HE PROBABLY
DEMANDED MORE MONEY,

1:17:25.583 --> 1:17:26.834
SO YOU KILLED HIM.

1:17:26.917 --> 1:17:29.208
GO ON.
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.

1:17:29.291 --> 1:17:30.583
WELL, WHAT
BETTER WAY

1:17:30.667 --> 1:17:32.125
TO CEMENT
THE IDEA OF A CURSE

1:17:32.208 --> 1:17:33.500
THAN WITH A MYSTERIOUS DEATH?

1:17:35.041 --> 1:17:37.959
AND I SUPPOSE
I KILLED SHERMAN, TOO.

1:17:40.542 --> 1:17:42.125
HOW COME?

1:17:42.208 --> 1:17:43.375
WELL, SIMPLE.

1:17:43.458 --> 1:17:45.166
I THINK HE FIGURED OUT
IT WAS A HOAX

1:17:45.250 --> 1:17:46.333
AND WAS GONNA TELL ME.

1:17:48.917 --> 1:17:51.125
DID I THROW
THE ROCKS, TOO?

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:52.959
YEAH.

1:17:53.041 --> 1:17:55.125
AND I THINK YOU HID THE KNIFE
IN ADELLE'S ROOM

1:17:55.208 --> 1:17:56.458
AND TRIED TO FRAME HER,

1:17:56.542 --> 1:17:57.792
BECAUSE YOU WERE JEALOUS

1:17:57.875 --> 1:17:59.291
OF ALL THE ATTENTION
BRAY WAS ALWAYS PAYING HER.

1:17:59.375 --> 1:18:02.041
YOU'RE MAKING ME SOUND LIKE
A CRAZY PERSON.

1:18:02.125 --> 1:18:03.917
OH, I THINK YOU ARE.

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.333
I MEAN, ONLY A CRAZY PERSON
WOULD THINK

1:18:06.417 --> 1:18:08.875
THEY COULD HOODWINK THE ENTIRE
ARCHEOLOGICAL COMMUNITY.

1:18:08.959 --> 1:18:10.333
I THINK WEBSTER
KNEW THAT.

1:18:10.417 --> 1:18:11.667
HE WAS
PLAYING YOU.

1:18:11.750 --> 1:18:14.333
HE WAS MAKING THE HOAX
LAST AS LONG AS HE COULD

1:18:14.417 --> 1:18:16.959
SO HE COULD MILK YOU
FOR ALL HE COULD.

1:18:17.041 --> 1:18:19.166
HE THOUGHT HE WAS CLEVER,

1:18:19.250 --> 1:18:21.208
BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
HE WAS DEALING WITH, DID HE?

1:18:23.959 --> 1:18:24.917
NO.

1:18:26.125 --> 1:18:28.458
I DON'T THINK YOU DO, EITHER.

1:18:31.166 --> 1:18:34.041
YOU MIGHT SAY YOU'RE TOO SMART
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

1:18:37.417 --> 1:18:41.041
LOOK LIKE WE'LL HAVE
TO CHALK UP ANOTHER DEATH

1:18:41.125 --> 1:18:42.375

YES! SHE HAS
THE BRAINS.

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:16.917
IT WAS HER IDEA TO REPORT
THE STUFF MISSING

1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:17.917
AND TO CLAIM
THE INSURANCE MONEY.

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:18.875
