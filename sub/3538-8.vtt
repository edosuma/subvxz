15:00.929 --> 15:02.011
How are my children?

15:03.095 --> 15:05.345
Uh, they're good.

15:05.428 --> 15:06.595
Ja,  they're well.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.512
Uh, Trevor's debate team
has gone--

15:10.595 --> 15:14.637
My hair hasn't been washed
in two weeks,

15:14.720 --> 15:16.595
and they cut my nails

15:16.679 --> 15:19.261
so I wouldn't scratch
my eyes out.

15:21.178 --> 15:25.387
My roommate is from
Bakersfield.

15:26.929 --> 15:30.512
She has a dairy farm
with her husband.

15:30.595 --> 15:34.095
She misses her cows.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.261
Uh, I need to...

15:41.470 --> 15:44.553
Well, I have some
legal papers, you see.

15:44.637 --> 15:46.720
They are with me here.
Let me show you.

15:50.261 --> 15:53.387
Uh, they-they are, you see,

15:53.470 --> 15:55.970
custody papers for the boys.

15:56.053 --> 15:58.553
The, uh, state of California
requires you to sign them--

15:58.637 --> 16:01.053
I'll have my family's lawyer
take a look.

16:03.387 --> 16:05.053
I'm not sure
that's entirely necessary.

16:05.136 --> 16:07.845
- You see, they--
- Shh.

16:07.929 --> 16:09.220
Honey...

16:09.303 --> 16:11.720
♪ tense music ♪

16:11.804 --> 16:15.595
I shan't be in here forever,
you know?

16:15.679 --> 16:17.136
And my father has some ideas

16:17.220 --> 16:20.804
about how best to litigate
our domestic travails.

16:22.345 --> 16:23.595
So you can fuck

16:23.679 --> 16:26.679
your little German slut
all you want.

16:26.762 --> 16:28.595
That's her problem now.

16:28.679 --> 16:30.136
There's no need for this.

16:30.220 --> 16:32.261
Is there not?

16:37.887 --> 16:39.970
You can keep the goddamn kids.

16:41.595 --> 16:43.929
You can keep the house.

16:44.011 --> 16:45.845
I'll go to Reno
and wait out the divorce,

16:45.929 --> 16:47.720
won't even name her
as a co-respondent

16:47.804 --> 16:49.887
in the proceedings.

16:49.970 --> 16:51.929
But then know this.

16:53.804 --> 16:57.011
As soon as it's all legal

16:57.095 --> 17:00.345
and I'm fucking
the young tennis pro

17:00.428 --> 17:02.762
at the club,

17:02.845 --> 17:04.553
I'll make it
my singular mission

17:04.637 --> 17:07.095
to take your life apart.

17:07.887 --> 17:11.136
Oh, and it's a house of cards,
darling.

17:11.220 --> 17:15.887
I'll pull them out one by one.

17:17.387 --> 17:19.679
You're a fraud, Peter.

17:19.762 --> 17:21.136
What are you gonna do

17:21.220 --> 17:23.553
when everyone finds out
who you really are?

17:28.470 --> 17:30.553
Next time you come,
bring a lawyer.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.387
And a cow for my roommate.

18:22.553 --> 18:23.679
I'm going home.

18:23.762 --> 18:26.887
I need to see my brother,
the cop.

18:26.970 --> 18:29.095
I need to tell him about Diego.
I can't live with it anymore.

18:29.178 --> 18:31.720
- Try.
- It should've been me!

18:31.804 --> 18:33.428
It had to be Diego.
That's why I gave him up.

18:34.887 --> 18:38.345
I made sure they got him
for you.

18:38.428 --> 18:40.387
You're a fucking lying puta.

18:40.470 --> 18:42.553
Stop it.

18:42.637 --> 18:45.136
You want to know
why I gave him up?

18:47.679 --> 18:50.345
Because I couldn't kill hope.

18:50.428 --> 18:53.929
You got something
most Pachucos don't,

18:54.011 --> 18:57.387
that heart, that faith,
that molten lava heat

18:57.470 --> 18:58.970
that can burn through hate.

18:59.053 --> 19:01.470
So turn your fear into courage.

19:01.553 --> 19:03.637
Make Diego's sacrifice count!

19:03.720 --> 19:05.345
No, no, no!

19:07.178 --> 19:09.762
You're meant to lead us.

19:09.845 --> 19:11.679
- That's Rico.
- It's you.

19:12.804 --> 19:15.762
It's you, mi rey,

19:15.845 --> 19:17.261
my king.

19:17.345 --> 19:19.011
It's always been you.

19:21.512 --> 19:22.595
Don't you see, Mateo?

19:22.679 --> 19:26.136
Your pure heart,
it can save us,

19:26.220 --> 19:29.095
lead us out of poverty,
give us a voice.

19:29.178 --> 19:32.929
You were born for this
and this alone.

19:33.011 --> 19:35.261
I don't know what I'm doing.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.387
You give them
the words they need

19:37.470 --> 19:39.261
so they know what to believe.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.178
You give them a taste of power
so they know what to want.

19:42.261 --> 19:46.220
You give them hope
so they'll die for you.

19:47.261 --> 19:49.970
And when they lose
the will to fight,

19:50.053 --> 19:52.720
you make them look inside
for strength

19:52.804 --> 19:55.720
so their fists come alive
like pounding hearts.

19:59.220 --> 20:00.512
And then?

20:02.136 --> 20:04.553
We walk in blood
to your throne.

20:18.178 --> 20:20.053
I wanted silk.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.387
People won't really be able
to tell the difference.

20:22.470 --> 20:27.428
But I will, and she will.
Silk makes her feel holy.

20:27.512 --> 20:29.261
I'll talk to her later.
Good day.

20:32.053 --> 20:33.387
May I have ten minutes
of your time?

20:41.970 --> 20:44.887
The Hazlett family
deserved justice.

20:44.970 --> 20:48.011
Our city is safer
because of your virtuous work.

20:48.095 --> 20:49.428
Thank you, Detective Vega.

20:50.845 --> 20:52.178
We did our best.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.345
So what do you think
of the new robe?

20:58.762 --> 21:00.095
It's just the same, isn't it?

21:00.178 --> 21:03.053
Oh, leave it to a man
to say that.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.303
The hem is
three inches shorter.

21:05.387 --> 21:07.970
My daughter insists
we become more modern.

21:09.220 --> 21:11.470
Do you think it's risqué?

21:11.553 --> 21:13.136
No.

21:13.220 --> 21:15.595
Then apparently I've failed.

21:15.679 --> 21:16.845
Please, sit down.

21:16.929 --> 21:19.136
What may I do for you?

21:23.679 --> 21:24.845
Richard Goss.

21:24.929 --> 21:26.428
Yes?

21:26.512 --> 21:27.595
So you know him.

21:27.679 --> 21:29.011
Yes.

21:29.095 --> 21:30.887
He's a foreign gentleman,
quite elegant.

21:30.970 --> 21:31.804
Why do you ask?

21:31.887 --> 21:33.220
How did you meet?

21:33.303 --> 21:35.637
He wanted to open up
his magnificent heart

21:35.720 --> 21:36.887
to the Lord.

21:36.970 --> 21:38.637
He's a Nazi.

21:38.720 --> 21:41.261
Oh, my.

21:41.345 --> 21:43.637
Jesus knows who to guide
into the path, praise be.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.387
I had no idea.

21:46.470 --> 21:47.970
Why were you having dinner
with him last night?

21:48.053 --> 21:50.470
You really are well-informed.

21:52.053 --> 21:54.428
I hope I can count
on your discretion,

21:54.512 --> 21:56.929
but we're going to open
a Temple in Pasadena,

21:57.011 --> 21:58.970
and Mr. Goss will help provide

21:59.053 --> 22:01.178
the funds
for the new construction.

22:01.261 --> 22:03.261
He was inspired
by one of Molly's sermons

22:03.345 --> 22:05.845
to take the word of God
far and wide.

22:09.845 --> 22:11.345
Pasadena, huh?

22:12.762 --> 22:14.553
To start.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.261
More and more later, we hope.

22:16.345 --> 22:18.345
Long Beach, Ventura,

22:18.428 --> 22:21.053
wherever the blessed road
of the Lord takes us.

22:21.136 --> 22:22.887
Won't you sit down?

22:22.970 --> 22:24.887
How long have you known him?

22:24.970 --> 22:27.387
A month, maybe less.

22:27.470 --> 22:30.387
I have no knowledge
of his politics, truly.

22:30.470 --> 22:33.095
I'm just grateful Mr. Goss
is able to contribute

22:33.178 --> 22:35.387
to our holy work.

22:35.470 --> 22:37.929
And what does Mr. Goss
get in return?

22:38.011 --> 22:39.303
What everyone wants:

22:39.387 --> 22:41.053
salvation.

22:41.970 --> 22:44.929
You really have no idea
what we do here, do you?

22:45.011 --> 22:46.720
Shall I show you?

22:48.095 --> 22:50.220
We feed over 400 people
a month,

22:50.303 --> 22:52.470
and that's just here.

22:52.553 --> 22:54.845
We have the soup kitchens
downtown as well.

22:54.929 --> 22:56.720
Up this hall,
there's a room full of beds

22:56.804 --> 22:58.804
for migrants
and the indigent.

22:58.887 --> 23:01.387
We have a hospital ward
with a doctor on staff,

23:01.470 --> 23:04.011
and there is no charge
for any of these services,

23:04.095 --> 23:05.845
of course.

23:05.929 --> 23:07.345
My vision,

23:07.428 --> 23:10.303
with the help of Mr. Goss
and others like him,

23:10.387 --> 23:11.970
is to have a Temple

23:12.053 --> 23:14.512
in every neighborhood
of Los Angeles.

23:14.595 --> 23:16.095
That's a nice business plan.

23:16.178 --> 23:17.887
You're quick to judge.

23:17.970 --> 23:19.470
Aren't you?

23:19.553 --> 23:22.178
If I were, I wouldn't
be speaking with you.

23:23.637 --> 23:28.053
I'm a work in progress,
just like my daughter.

23:28.136 --> 23:30.387
I'm not here to talk
about Molly.

23:30.470 --> 23:33.011
Yet she's all over
your words.

23:33.095 --> 23:34.845
Have you ever seen a baptism?

23:34.929 --> 23:37.095
It's truly an experience
for the soul.

23:37.178 --> 23:38.595
Not in the mood.

23:38.679 --> 23:39.679
What else do you know
about Mr.--

23:39.762 --> 23:42.553
Here, let me show you.

23:54.345 --> 23:57.387
A baptism is a communion
with God,

23:57.470 --> 23:59.095
much like
what people experience

23:59.178 --> 24:00.512
when they come to see my Molly.

24:00.595 --> 24:03.261
Something deep within awakens.

24:04.095 --> 24:06.011
But you know
what that feels like.

24:06.095 --> 24:08.178
I told you, I'm not here
to talk about Molly.

24:08.261 --> 24:10.595
You think you're in love
with her,

24:10.679 --> 24:12.553
but you've fallen in love
with God's whisper.

24:14.136 --> 24:17.095
And as I've said,
she's not perfect.

24:17.178 --> 24:19.887
Molly adores a thrill,

No.

that was the most beautiful,

35:07.804 --> 35:10.220

48:39.428 --> 48:41.178
Will he tell anyone?

48:41.261 --> 48:42.929
Who cares?

48:50.512 --> 48:51.845
I can't afford to lose her.

48:51.970 --> 48:53.220
We can't afford
to lose a child.

48:53.303 --> 48:54.387
It was an accident.

48:54.470 --> 48:55.762
Frank almost lost his hand.

48:55.845 --> 48:57.053
Nonsense.
He was only burned.

48:57.136 --> 48:58.553
It wasn't her fault.

48:58.637 --> 48:59.887
She's supposed to be
looking after them.

48:59.970 --> 49:01.887
- If we can't trust--
- Let me think.

49:01.970 --> 49:03.387
There's nothing
to think about.

49:03.470 --> 49:04.220
Fire her!

49:04.303 --> 49:05.637
Elsa, stop.

49:06.845 --> 49:09.679
This is what we talked about.

49:09.762 --> 49:11.845
Will you be
the strong man I need,

49:11.929 --> 49:13.762
or will you let
an old Mexican woman

49:13.845 --> 49:15.136
be the master in this house?

49:18.136 --> 49:20.720
I don't need Peter Craft.
I need Peter Krupp!

49:20.804 --> 49:21.804
Excuse me.

49:23.470 --> 49:24.679
I will go home now.

49:24.762 --> 49:26.553
Ah, ja.

49:26.637 --> 49:27.887
I'm sorry about tonight.

49:27.970 --> 49:29.887
Oh, no, no.
He will be fine.

49:29.970 --> 49:32.136
We have to speak to you
about something.

49:32.970 --> 49:33.595
At this moment?

49:33.679 --> 49:34.845
Yes.

49:40.887 --> 49:45.553
Uh, Maria...

49:45.637 --> 49:47.053
well, you work so hard
for this family

49:47.136 --> 49:50.970
and, uh, for so long,

49:51.053 --> 49:53.845
but...we have decided...

49:58.679 --> 50:00.345
♪ uneasy music ♪

50:00.428 --> 50:02.095
...that you shall have a raise.

50:04.178 --> 50:06.428
Five dollars more a week,
shall we say?

50:06.512 --> 50:08.261
That is not necessary,
Dr. Craft.

50:08.345 --> 50:09.887
Oh, please.

50:10.679 --> 50:13.804
This family could not do
without you.

50:13.887 --> 50:16.053
Now, go home and see
your children, ja?

50:17.970 --> 50:20.345
Thank you.
Good night.

50:24.345 --> 50:28.136
- You want Peter Krupp?

50:28.220 --> 50:29.387
Here he is.

50:49.011 --> 50:50.470
What's so damn important?

50:50.553 --> 50:53.470
I went to see Townsend.

50:53.553 --> 50:55.303
He evaded badly.

50:55.387 --> 50:57.970
He's up to his neck
in whatever it is,

50:58.053 --> 51:00.512
but there was this big map
of the new motorway

51:00.595 --> 51:01.845
in his office.

51:01.929 --> 51:03.637
It came
from a construction company

51:03.720 --> 51:06.178
called Via Hermosa Development,
so I thought I might as well--

51:06.261 --> 51:09.011
Wait, Miss Adelaide had one
of those in her office too.

51:09.095 --> 51:12.637
So they're working together
to build the motorway?

51:12.720 --> 51:15.428
What the fuck's that about?

51:15.512 --> 51:17.595
But here's the thing:
after I saw the map,

51:17.679 --> 51:18.762
I went to the hall of records

51:18.845 --> 51:20.762
to dig around
about Via Hermosa,

51:20.845 --> 51:23.637
corporate filings and the like.

51:23.720 --> 51:26.345
A lot of dummy paperwork
and shell companies,

51:26.428 --> 51:29.011
but it all came down
to one man,

51:29.095 --> 51:30.512
Richard Goss.

51:31.720 --> 51:34.345
The Nazis, City Hall,

51:34.428 --> 51:37.637
the Temple, the motorway.

51:37.720 --> 51:39.970
What does this all add up to?

51:42.011 --> 51:44.136
The future of Los Angeles.

51:45.720 --> 51:47.887
So...I thought you and I

51:47.970 --> 51:49.470
should make
a little nighttime visit

51:49.553 --> 51:51.428
to the Via Hermosa offices.

51:51.512 --> 51:52.887
If we can find
anything concrete

51:52.970 --> 51:53.887
to connect all this--

51:53.970 --> 51:55.053
You mean break in?

51:55.136 --> 51:57.136
Yes, sunshine,
I mean break in.

51:57.220 --> 51:58.261
Come on.

52:01.428 --> 52:04.053
Oh, and, Tiago...

52:04.136 --> 52:06.720
I don't care if you're fucking
the Dragon Mother herself.

52:06.804 --> 52:08.595
Last time you pull
this shit on me.

52:08.679 --> 52:10.220
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

52:10.303 --> 52:12.178
Too many secrets
take you six feet under.

52:12.261 --> 52:14.512
It won't happen again, Lewis.

52:14.595 --> 52:17.011
Now, how long you been
doing it?

52:17.095 --> 52:18.929
A month, maybe.

52:20.011 --> 52:22.845
Does she know about her mother
and the Nazis?

52:22.929 --> 52:24.637
- No.
- You sure?

52:25.845 --> 52:27.178
No.

52:28.679 --> 52:30.637
You know better
than to be doing this.

52:30.720 --> 52:32.679
I do.

52:32.762 --> 52:35.011
Yeah, I know.

52:40.679 --> 52:43.470
A secret lay is always good,
I give you that.
