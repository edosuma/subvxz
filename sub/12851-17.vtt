♪♪

00:05.973 --> 00:08.474
-Are we best friends?
-How could you even
ask me that?

00:08.476 --> 00:10.275
Yeah, but what are
best friends?

00:10.277 --> 00:12.111
You and i,
who would do anything
for each other.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.545
Would you give me
your kidney?

00:13.547 --> 00:15.280
I'd give you
my left one.

00:15.282 --> 00:16.882
I want your right one.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.785
But that's
nicole kidney.

00:20.955 --> 00:22.388
Too bad, mine now.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.123
There is one final test
you must pass.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.324
I shall pass
that test,

00:25.326 --> 00:27.292
Because that's
how best friendy we are.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.328
-Now give me that test.
-Would you kidnap someone

00:29.330 --> 00:30.829
That really needed
to be kidnapped,

00:30.831 --> 00:32.398
And handcuff her
to the radiator
and lock the door

00:32.400 --> 00:34.700
And not tell anybody?

00:34.702 --> 00:37.403
Did you do something?

00:43.344 --> 00:45.477
Is that my bow?

00:45.479 --> 00:47.212
Yup.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.647
You took my bow?

00:48.649 --> 00:49.715
Yup.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.684
When did you take
my bow?

00:52.686 --> 00:55.154
Hey, sherlock,
is there anything else
jumpin' out at you?

00:57.158 --> 00:59.324
Have you always
had that lady?

01:01.262 --> 01:03.529
No, brand-new.

01:03.531 --> 01:07.433
And if you used my bow,
does that make me
an accomplice?

01:07.435 --> 01:11.403
If this wasn't my room,
i'd have nothing to do
with this.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.238
Oh, no.

What did you do?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.437
I stole a lady.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.507
What happens now?

02:25.112 --> 02:27.980
So, um, how good
of a lawyer are you?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.581
Never lost a case.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.317
Oh. Well, that's over.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.788
She's already seen
your face.

02:36.790 --> 02:40.025
Yes. But she doesn't know
that my name is riley matthews.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.860
Shnagel.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.098
Hi.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.470
Does she have
a good reason for this?

02:51.472 --> 02:53.972
(with french accent)
i am an international superstar.

02:53.974 --> 02:57.142
I will not be handcuffed
to a radiator.

02:57.144 --> 03:00.512
Hey, you said that just like
anastasia boulangerie

03:00.514 --> 03:04.416
In the blockbuster thriller
<i>i will not be 'andcuffed</i>
<i>to a radiator.</i>

03:05.519 --> 03:07.052
-Riley?
-Yeah?

03:07.054 --> 03:09.288
That is anastasia boulangerie.

03:12.493 --> 03:17.262
Yeeeeeeeeeeee!

03:18.499 --> 03:20.132
Where are my cookies?

03:20.134 --> 03:22.334
-What?
-I want my french cookies.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.969
Do you know
what they are called?

03:23.971 --> 03:25.170
Macaroons!

03:25.172 --> 03:29.041
Yes! You will be
my new cookie bringer!

03:29.043 --> 03:31.510
Yay! Maya, yay!

03:31.512 --> 03:34.580
Riley, focus. We kidnapped
anastasia boulangerie.

03:34.582 --> 03:38.150
Oh! Well, go big or go home,
i always say.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.755
Really?
Never lost a case, huh?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.157
-Think you ever will?
-No.

03:45.159 --> 03:46.391
Ha-ha!

03:50.898 --> 03:54.266
This is not crème fraîche.
This is whipped cream.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.601
From a store.

03:56.937 --> 04:00.038
I have failed you.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.443
Oh, and you, street rat.
You call this a flower?

04:04.445 --> 04:07.446
No, no, no.
I call this a blob.

04:07.448 --> 04:11.083
-Look, lady, you're
not our guest, you're being--
-borrowed.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.884
-What?
-Borrowed is what we did.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.187
I don't like the other word.
I like borrowed.

04:15.189 --> 04:16.588
I-- i don't think
it makes a difference.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.023
Oh, yes, i think it does.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.858
I don't mind being borrowed.

04:19.860 --> 04:23.061
It's romantic,
like a fountain.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.930
Get me a fountain.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.532
(laughing)

04:27.534 --> 04:30.535
Why, you're laughing
because where are we gonna get
a fountain?

04:30.537 --> 04:32.871
No, i'm laughing
because what on earth
is my father going

04:32.873 --> 04:34.640
To put on the board
for this one?

04:38.078 --> 04:39.511
Squeak!

04:47.054 --> 04:49.821
I wanted a chocolate fountain.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.629
And i wanted a chance
for my mom to play
one great role.

04:58.565 --> 05:01.667
You went too far,
do you understand?

05:01.669 --> 05:03.435
And i went too far
because i am your best friend,

05:03.437 --> 05:05.837
But there are limits
to best friendship.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.073
There are no limits to us.

05:08.075 --> 05:11.510
Good! Now, let's
just not do anything
that could get us caught.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.250
(shutter clicking)

05:19.753 --> 05:22.921
Look, i know what we did
was wrong, but the reason
i did it

05:22.923 --> 05:24.990
Is because my mom's up
for a movie, and i think
she could really

05:24.992 --> 05:26.692
-Be right for the role.
-What is it?

05:26.694 --> 05:28.694
The role of katy,
a down-on-her-luck waitress

05:28.696 --> 05:31.029
Who's always wanted
to be an actress,
has one daughter

05:31.031 --> 05:32.431
And one last shot at love.

05:32.433 --> 05:35.300
There is only one person
in the world who could play
this role!

05:35.302 --> 05:37.436
-I know.
-Anastasia boulangerie!

05:37.438 --> 05:39.371
Yes, of course
i will play the role!

05:39.373 --> 05:40.605
I am perfect
for everything!

05:40.607 --> 05:44.976
Wait. Why did maya
borrow you if you already
have the role?

05:44.978 --> 05:48.980
Are you not telling me
the whole truth,
anastasia boulangerie?

05:48.982 --> 05:54.386
Okay. Okay, there may be
a certain insignificant
unknown who is

05:54.388 --> 05:57.689
Also up for the role.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.524
And it's katy hunter,
isn't it?

05:59.526 --> 06:03.395
Yes. Katy 'unter.

06:03.397 --> 06:06.231
Well, why don't you
just let maya's mother
have this one,

06:06.233 --> 06:10.135
And you go play
queen francy-pants of france?

06:10.137 --> 06:11.803
Are we leakin' again?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.638
Oh, we got a fountain.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.742
Bobbie jo?

06:16.744 --> 06:19.878
I am sure i have no idea
of this bobbie jo who you say.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.149
Oh, knock off
the phony accent, bobbie jo,
i know who you are.

06:24.151 --> 06:30.021
(hillbilly accent)
okay, fine! But this here
does not leave this here room!

06:30.023 --> 06:32.524
-What?
-The?

06:32.526 --> 06:36.428
I always promised
to keep your secret
and i always have.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.662
Yeah, katy, you always have.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.732
Mom, you know her?

06:40.734 --> 06:45.404
Oh! We kind of
grew up together.

06:45.406 --> 06:48.673
You grew up
with queen pantsy-france
of pants?

06:48.675 --> 06:51.076
Maya, i'm sorry
i never told you
about bobbie jo,

06:51.078 --> 06:52.577
But she made me promise.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.579
Well, if this got out,
it could ruin everything
for me!

06:54.581 --> 06:56.148
What is it?

06:58.385 --> 07:00.886
Anastasia boulangerie
is not from france.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.254
Both:
What?

07:02.256 --> 07:03.822
See?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.091
Where is she from?

07:06.093 --> 07:09.528
She is from possum trot,
arkansas.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.030
-Both: What?
-See?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.598
But you're from
possum trot, arkansas.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.801
-What?
-Riley, you knew that.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.636
I can't stop.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.639
Maya, you know how
maya hart has riley matthews.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.940
Always and forever.

07:21.942 --> 07:26.778
Well, katy grace clutterbucket
always thought she'd have...

07:26.780 --> 07:30.982
-Bobbie jo thibodeaux.
-How do?

07:30.984 --> 07:34.052
Your best friend
was anastasia boulangerie?

07:34.054 --> 07:37.923
No. Uh, my best friend
was bobbie jo thibodeaux.

07:37.925 --> 07:41.560
I was never very close
to anastasia boulangerie,
who left.

07:41.562 --> 07:47.065
But at one time,
we would've done anything
for each other.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.868
Maya, i don't understand.
How could this happen
to best friends?

07:52.773 --> 07:55.006
Well, mom, do you want me
to set her free?

07:56.777 --> 07:59.044
No, mama really
wants this role.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.783
No, really,
how good a lawyer
are you?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.785
Ha-ha.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.819
Ha-ha.

08:12.993 --> 08:17.796
So, we all heard
from yogi's father,
officer yogi,

08:17.798 --> 08:19.364
About gritty real life.

08:19.366 --> 08:22.601
And now, to talk to you guys
about a life of imagination,

08:22.603 --> 08:25.704
Is sarah's father,
a movie director.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.039
The policeman had nothing
to do with us.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.075
(whispers)
we're in the clear.

08:31.712 --> 08:36.681
I'm... A movie director.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.183
We're fine.

08:38.185 --> 08:44.523
And my next project is
the new anastasia boulangerie,
yeah, movie.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.861
We're less fine.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.062
Does anybody know
where she is?

08:51.064 --> 08:54.566
-Go crazy.
-Bark!

08:54.568 --> 08:57.969
My name is dw preminger,
and i have my wonderful daughter
to thank for the idea

08:57.971 --> 09:01.039
Behind my new film
about a struggling waitress.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.807
-And her daughter
-and her friends!

09:02.809 --> 09:05.911
Yeah, that's right.
You think i've just
been sitting here?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.913
I've been taking notes!

09:07.915 --> 09:09.581
I've been writing
my screenplay.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.185
But in the fairy tale town
that is hollywood,

09:14.187 --> 09:18.890
There is actually
an upstart contender
challenging ms. Boulangerie

09:18.892 --> 09:21.493
For this role,
and you know,
it just might happen,

09:21.495 --> 09:26.231
Because the world loves
an undiscovered underdog.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.100
And also because...
We can't find the other one.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.903
So, does anybody
know where she is?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.271
Both:
No!

09:33.273 --> 09:36.708
I believe there was
another thing you
wanted to tell them, dw?

09:36.710 --> 09:39.744
You know what else
the audience likes?

09:39.746 --> 09:42.380
"authenticity!"

09:42.382 --> 09:46.952
So, in the interest
of authenticity,
dw preminger's going

09:46.954 --> 09:51.590
To extend an invitation
to the real life friends
of his daughter's imagination

09:51.592 --> 09:57.028
Because what could be
more hollywood authentic
than holding out false hope...

09:58.865 --> 10:03.902
To you, who inspired the roles,
to audition for the roles,
of dookas...

10:03.904 --> 10:05.136
-Dookas?
-Zed--

10:05.138 --> 10:08.139
-Zed?
-And farkle
poopypants mcstupidhead.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.444
Ha-ha, dookus!

10:15.115 --> 10:17.749
-What about us?
-Aren't we in it?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.718
Yeah, you sit on the side
and don't talk.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.455
That seems fair.

10:23.457 --> 10:26.992
Now, if you'll excuse me,
i have a missing actress
to locate.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.627
You gonna call in the fbi?

10:28.629 --> 10:33.898
No, i... Was just gonna
look around, but, hey!

10:35.268 --> 10:37.435
You see, maya,
i have good ideas.

10:37.437 --> 10:40.872
Worst...
Sidekick... Ever.

10:44.945 --> 10:50.582
Free time. I don't remember
the last time i had free time.
What does one do with free time?

10:56.623 --> 10:58.657
Yes?

10:58.659 --> 11:01.326
Define felony.

11:01.328 --> 11:06.598
Oh my gosh. It's
anastasia boulangerie
and she's holding a radiator.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.833
<i>Oui.</i>
I am holding a radiator
because the fbi

11:08.835 --> 11:12.003
Is hot on my trail
and they had to move me.

11:12.005 --> 11:16.174
I believe you are familiar
with my captors?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.676
Captors?

11:17.678 --> 11:20.111
No, we only borrowed
her, mommy.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.513
Did they only borrow you?

11:21.515 --> 11:23.348
Actually, i am enjoying
myself, yes.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.350
Okay, good.
Because otherwise
it's kidnapping!

11:25.352 --> 11:27.786
-Don't do that!
-We won't.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.020
There are consequences,
you know.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.055
Oh.

11:32.626 --> 11:36.895
Anastasia boulangerie
is actually bobbie jo
thibodeux, my old friend

11:36.897 --> 11:38.663
From possum trot, arkansas.

11:38.665 --> 11:42.000
Really?
That's a little hard
to believe.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.968
(hillbilly accent)
well, believe it, sister.

11:45.839 --> 11:49.074
You know, i know
it's hard to believe,
but it's true.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.076
We were best friends.

11:51.078 --> 11:54.479
I don't know about that.
Real best friends don't
fall apart.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.881
Real best friends
would do anything
for each other.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.485
But i bet that you have
loads of best friends

12:00.487 --> 12:02.420
Now that you're rich
and famous.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.825
I'm sorry, katy.

12:06.827 --> 12:10.128
I'm sorry that i made it
hard to believe.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.935
I'm katy grace.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.106

We played all the county fairs.

13:55.468 --> 14:00.371
Promised each other...
That if either one of us
ever got famous,

14:00.373 --> 14:02.674
We'd be happy for each other.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.543
I always have been.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.346
Bobbie jo, i would never
take anything away from you.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.383
I know that, katy.
I know you wouldn't.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.653
Look at you two.
Is fame and fortune
really worth

14:15.655 --> 14:17.822
Being separated
from your best friend?

14:17.824 --> 14:19.257
-Yeah.
-Of course not.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.995
I don't get this.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.297
-Neither do i.
-I don't care how famous
you got.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.299
Friends are supposed
to be friends.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.735
Why didn't
you miss her more?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.739
Well, i think maybe
she did.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.842
Yeah. The way i see it,
you could've lifted up
that radiator

14:37.844 --> 14:39.844
And gotten away
any time you wanted.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.046
I would hardly
call this a kidnapping.

14:42.048 --> 14:46.851
Okay, fine, it wasn't.
I knew it was maya
from all the pictures

14:46.853 --> 14:48.586
I'd seen of you.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.721
You looked me up?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.089
Maybe a little.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.690
You checkin' up on us?

14:52.692 --> 14:54.492
Congratulations
on gettin' married again.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.060
He seems like
a really a good man.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.263
He's wonderful.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.900
I got my baby girl
and a husband
who loves me.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.235
I love my life.

15:04.237 --> 15:08.606
Yeah. I love my life, too.

15:08.608 --> 15:14.012
So... (clears throat)
you will not be auditioning
for the role of katy anymore?

15:14.014 --> 15:17.982
Against you?
Me against you
for the role of me?

15:19.552 --> 15:23.121
Oh...
No, i'll be auditioning.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.191
And i'm gonna beat you.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.262
They were best friends
once, maya.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.098
-Now they're
going against each other.
-Best friends are supposed

15:34.100 --> 15:36.935
To stay best friends.
-Mm, i don't think
they know that.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.613
Hey, sarah.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.917
We're here to audition
for the roles of dookas,
zed and farkle.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.219
Yeah, you and the rest
of the city.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.062
I'm not happy!

16:04.064 --> 16:06.431
I'm wearin' my cowboy hat.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.167
I'm wearin'
my cowboy hat!

16:09.169 --> 16:12.170
My moment's gonna be
my cowboy hat!

16:12.172 --> 16:13.938
Am i an idiot?

16:13.940 --> 16:17.508
I withhold judgment
because i'm smart enough
to know what happens next.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.111
Lucas! I'm up in the air!

16:20.113 --> 16:23.147
Yeah, that's how i did it.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.116
Anastasia! There you are,
my darling!

16:25.118 --> 16:26.584
Where have you been?

16:26.586 --> 16:29.320
(french accent) i took
some time to consider
my, how you say, priorities.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.588
-What?
-Priorities.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.323
-What?
-(hillbilly accent)
i been thinkin' about stuff!

16:32.325 --> 16:33.491
What just happened?

16:34.961 --> 16:36.861
All right, look...

16:36.863 --> 16:42.166
I'm all for hollywood
fairy tales...
But the truth is,

16:42.168 --> 16:45.269
She's a big box office draw,
and you're not.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.838
Anastasia,
the role is yours,
unless someone

16:46.840 --> 16:48.206
Has a real good reason
why it isn't.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.375
-Authenticity?
-Sorry. What?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.477
You said that authenticity
was a very big deal to you?

16:52.479 --> 16:55.213
No, i said that authenticity
was a very big deal
to the audience.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.348
I prefer pretty people
sayin' stuff.

16:57.350 --> 17:01.219
My mother's pretty,
and she says stuff
just as good as she does.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.856
Yeah?
Let's see if that's so.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.824
Would you
like a moment to prepare?

17:06.826 --> 17:08.493
I've been prepared
my whole life.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.527
I know it by heart.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.296
I'll read the parts
of smiley and banana.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.866
-Banana?
-I'm smiley!

17:14.868 --> 17:20.538
No, i'm going
to perform the scene
to this riley and this maya.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.440
Because they've always
kept me real.

17:26.346 --> 17:30.381
Actually,
it only looks like
nothin' ever went right for me.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.085
Maybe bein' walked out on
by the wrong guy

17:34.087 --> 17:36.220
Is what allowed
the right guy to walk in.

17:38.425 --> 17:43.828
Maybe watchin' my daughter
discover the joy
of a best friend

17:43.830 --> 17:48.666
Is what teaches me
who mine really are.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.302
And maybe bein' apart...

17:53.440 --> 17:58.676
Is supposed to show you
how hard you're supposed
to fight to stay together.

17:58.678 --> 18:02.580
'cause a true friend
is the best thing
that life has to offer.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.350
Anastasia?

18:06.352 --> 18:08.019
I could never beat that.

18:08.021 --> 18:10.922
-Why not?
-Because i, uh...
(clears throat)

18:10.924 --> 18:12.056
Don't believe in it.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.592
Yes, maybe i'm this,
so i could be that,
pish-posh.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.562
I am who i am,
and this is who i am.

18:17.564 --> 18:21.499
Give the role to her.
She was born to play it.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.403
But you're
anastasia boulangerie.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.472
And she is katy hunter.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.140
Real person.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.475
Bravo.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.949
Be careful bein' famous.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.650
It's easy to forget
who you are.

18:41.588 --> 18:44.789
Girls! You
can borrow me anytime!

Okay!

19:09.349 --> 19:13.618
Mr. Matthews,
what do you call
being best friends with someone

19:13.620 --> 19:17.088
One day and then
growing apart forever?

19:17.090 --> 19:19.090
Unfortunately,
i call that normal, maya.

19:19.092 --> 19:20.992
No.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.494
Don't worry, maya.
Nothing could change us.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.229
Not even hollywood.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.065
Huh!

19:36.543 --> 19:39.911

Thank you very much!

Yeah, listen up, sy.

19:52.559 --> 19:56.394

20:28.828 --> 20:30.161
No!

20:33.833 --> 20:36.734
Well... Maya?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.371
I've decided
that when i grow up...

20:40.373 --> 20:44.208
I want
to be my mother's daughter,

20:44.210 --> 20:48.379
I want to be riley's friend,
and i want us all to know

20:48.381 --> 20:49.513
How important we are
to each other.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.350
I would do anything
for you.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.751
I know.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.694
Farkle reading for the role
of farkle.

21:03.696 --> 21:04.895
Any questions?

21:04.897 --> 21:06.430
Yeah, how do you--
how do you want this guy?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.266
Farkly.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.534
There was the very fast-talking
farkle where everybody
would yell at me--

21:10.536 --> 21:12.536
-Slow down!
-Yeah, like that.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.305
And then there was
donnie barnes, regular guy!

21:14.307 --> 21:15.873
I'd see that movie.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.475
And now
there's the current farkle,
who's somewhere

21:17.477 --> 21:19.710
Between nerd-chic
and teenage heartthrob
poster boy.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.448
Next!

21:24.450 --> 21:25.483
Yeah, okay.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.821
Hello. Lucas friar,
auditioning for the role
of dookas.

21:30.823 --> 21:35.593
-Okay... Dookas
is the strong, silent type.
-Okay.

21:35.595 --> 21:40.631
He's able to convey
a lot of emotions
through very few words.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.600
Okay.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.268
He's got a smoldering presence

21:44.270 --> 21:47.571
That makes men want to be him,

21:47.573 --> 21:50.408
And women want
to be with him.

21:50.410 --> 21:54.512
Okay.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.013
Do you do accents?

21:58.351 --> 22:02.119
