03:25.940 --> 03:26.874
<i>Reo.</i>

03:36.718 --> 03:38.251
You scared me.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.555
<i>Did you get what I asked for?</i>

03:40.955 --> 03:41.889
Yeah.

03:45.727 --> 03:46.661
Hey, Dad.

03:48.196 --> 03:49.530
I'm gonna beat you.

03:49.931 --> 03:51.431
I'm gonna beat you at this game.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.934
<i>All right. We'll see.</i>

04:22.029 --> 04:24.198
<i>The number</i>
<i>of homicides and suicides</i>

04:24.431 --> 04:26.601
<i>continues to climb</i>
<i>since the release</i>

04:26.801 --> 04:29.369
<i>of the groundbreaking footage</i>
<i>of Reo Nakata</i>

04:29.704 --> 04:31.939
<i>playing cards</i>
<i>with his dead father.</i>

04:32.339 --> 04:35.176
<i>Dr. Stevensen</i>
<i>of the Life Beyond Institute</i>

04:35.375 --> 04:37.812
<i>is live now to address</i>
<i>Congress's motion</i>

04:38.012 --> 04:40.748
<i>to shut her study down.</i>
<i>Let's take a listen.</i>

04:41.749 --> 04:43.316
<i>It is irrefutable.</i>

04:43.651 --> 04:46.486
<i>Our consciousness continues</i>
<i>beyond our physical bodies.</i>

04:46.687 --> 04:48.823
<i>Death is merely a transition</i>

04:48.923 --> 04:50.525
<i>to another existence...</i>

04:50.658 --> 04:52.160
<i>...one we can now see...</i>

04:52.260 --> 04:53.493
<i>...track and record</i>

04:53.594 --> 04:56.329
<i>due to the findings</i>
<i>of my Life Beyond research.</i>

04:57.165 --> 05:00.101
<i>At our institute, we now bridge</i>
<i>dozens of new participants</i>

05:00.367 --> 05:01.636
<i>daily from this world</i>
<i>to the next,</i>

05:01.869 --> 05:04.471
<i>which has led</i>
<i>to astounding breakthroughs.</i>

05:05.338 --> 05:06.641
<i>Soon, we will</i>
<i>be able to comprehend</i>

05:06.874 --> 05:09.076
<i>what was previously</i>
<i>the great unknown.</i>

05:09.710 --> 05:11.546
<i>With countless possibilities</i>
<i>ahead of us,</i>

05:11.746 --> 05:15.183
<i>it is imperative</i>
<i>we continue this research.</i>

05:15.850 --> 05:17.952
<i>Much like many explorers</i>
<i>before us,</i>

05:18.186 --> 05:20.054
<i>we have seen our world expand.</i>

05:20.387 --> 05:23.291
<i>It is now our duty</i>
<i>to discover how far.</i>

05:23.758 --> 05:26.060
<i>Contrary to recent news,</i>
<i>my Life Beyond study,</i>

05:26.294 --> 05:28.029
<i>like all proper</i>
<i>research programs,</i>

05:28.229 --> 05:29.764
<i>is strictly a</i>
<i>volunteer program.</i>

05:30.031 --> 05:34.168
<i>It is a clinical,</i>
<i>not criminal enterprise.</i>

05:34.769 --> 05:37.171
<i>Congress is attempting</i>
<i>to shut us down,</i>

05:37.404 --> 05:38.506
<i>but their efforts only show</i>

05:38.706 --> 05:40.541
<i>how much they fundamentally</i>
<i>misunderstand</i>

05:40.775 --> 05:42.109
<i>the facts of our new reality...</i>

06:18.679 --> 06:21.349
Hey, it's Chad.
I'm here for the TV.

06:21.549 --> 06:22.750
You got the cash?

06:38.733 --> 06:42.069
It works, right?

06:42.402 --> 06:43.537
Yeah.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.875
<i>What do you have to say</i>

06:47.975 --> 06:49.310
<i>about the shootings</i>
<i>taking place?</i>

06:49.577 --> 06:50.945
<i>Everyone needs to calm down.</i>

06:51.045 --> 06:52.513
<i>Congress will sort out</i>
<i>the legislation</i>

06:52.613 --> 06:53.814
<i>- but in the meantime...</i>
- All yours.

06:53.948 --> 06:55.415
<i>...people are adding</i>
<i>to the chaos, all right?</i>

06:55.516 --> 06:57.285
<i>We really need to know more</i>
<i>before any decision.</i>

06:57.518 --> 06:59.020
Hello?

06:59.153 --> 07:00.688
<i>Hello! This is James</i>

07:00.788 --> 07:02.523
<i>from Dr. Stevensen's</i>
<i>Life Beyond study.</i>

07:02.623 --> 07:04.091
<i>Can you please confirm</i>
<i>your password?</i>

07:04.392 --> 07:08.195
Uh. Yeah. It's,
uh, 35 capital FML.

07:09.130 --> 07:10.197
<i>Just checking to confirm,</i>

07:10.398 --> 07:12.233
<i>you declined your flight</i>
<i>to San Francisco</i>

07:12.465 --> 07:14.669
<i>- and requested a car?</i>
- Yeah.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.370
They told me
that would be okay.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.470
<i>Of course.</i>

07:17.805 --> 07:19.407
<i>I'm sending your car rental</i>
<i>information now.</i>

07:19.607 --> 07:21.042
<i>Pick-up is noon today.</i>

07:22.977 --> 07:23.945
I'll be there.

07:24.779 --> 07:26.247
<i>Everything is in order.</i>

07:26.479 --> 07:28.249
<i>Have your confirmation</i>
<i>QR code when you arrive</i>

07:28.448 --> 07:31.886
<i>- and we'll see you soon.</i>
- Okay, thanks. Bye.

07:34.322 --> 07:37.158
So, are you one of those people?

07:37.692 --> 07:41.662
That must be exciting to...
just let it all go.

07:42.263 --> 07:43.564
I respect that.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.870
Can I do anything else
for you before you go?

07:56.310 --> 07:57.878
Let me help you with the TV.

08:03.217 --> 08:04.685
Hey, I can get that.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.254
Hey.

08:09.924 --> 08:10.925
Hey!

08:15.429 --> 08:17.999
Whoa, hey!
Give me back my money!

08:19.633 --> 08:20.701
<i>Just give me the fucking money.</i>

08:22.737 --> 08:24.672
<i>I'm gonna keep</i>
<i>standing out here.</i>

08:26.774 --> 08:27.541
<i>Hello?</i>

08:30.578 --> 08:32.947
<i>You crazy bitch!</i>

08:41.122 --> 08:43.724
No, I got it.
Noon pick-up. I'll be there.

08:44.158 --> 08:45.259
Great. Thank you.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.228
Fuck yeah, Stanley!

08:47.628 --> 08:50.164
Hey, I'm going to San Francisco.

08:50.598 --> 08:51.966
What? You're one of them??

09:01.442 --> 09:02.376
<i>That's right.</i>

09:02.543 --> 09:04.745
<i>We're here live</i>
<i>in San Francisco.</i>

09:05.279 --> 09:06.981
<i>Crowds have gathered</i>
<i>just outside Dr. Stevensen.</i>

09:07.181 --> 09:08.849
I'm just eating breakfast.
Come in. Come in.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.284
<i>The next round...</i>

09:10.384 --> 09:12.119
What the hell's the dog
doing here?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.222
<i>And they're coming out now.</i>

09:15.356 --> 09:17.992
<i>They're taking their positions.</i>
<i>This is very exciting.</i>

09:20.661 --> 09:22.329
<i>Here's Dr. Stevensen herself.</i>

09:22.797 --> 09:24.598
Killing themselves
over this bull bunk.

09:25.166 --> 09:27.334
They say robberies are down
because the robbers

09:27.536 --> 09:29.437
can't get people to do
what they want anymore.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.172
Like dying isn't dying.

09:31.405 --> 09:34.875
Well, it's... it's been proven,
Milton. It's science now.

09:35.276 --> 09:37.745
But science is supposed
to make ya smarter, not dumber.

09:40.381 --> 09:41.849
Hey, look, Milton, um...

09:42.551 --> 09:44.452
I've got to go.
I've got somewhere to be.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.587
What? I put you
on the team for today.

09:46.821 --> 09:48.923
You said you wanted this gig.
You can't do this.

09:49.123 --> 09:52.326
I'm here for Stanley.
I'm... I'm leaving him to you.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.964
<i>We're so</i>
<i>excited to be here to help see</i>

09:57.198 --> 09:59.266
<i>and support</i>
<i>our brave new participants.</i>

09:59.500 --> 10:00.535
<i>Let's give them</i>
<i>a round of applause.</i>

10:00.801 --> 10:03.637
<i>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

10:06.073 --> 10:07.509
It's not the fucking Oscars,
kid.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.076
There's nothing to celebrate.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.112
I'm going to San Francisco.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.480
Teddy...

10:12.680 --> 10:14.181
I'm not asking
for permission.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.749
Teddy, you're...
you're young yet.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.918
You don't know how much
you have to look forward to.

10:18.152 --> 10:20.354
Come on.
We both know that's not true.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.324
I mean, did...
did you see that Niko guy on TV?

10:23.558 --> 10:24.593
I saw a bunch of people.

10:24.825 --> 10:28.662
Every station, every newspaper.
Like him. Like me.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.066
I mean, I'm on that list.
This way...

10:32.700 --> 10:35.769
this way, I... I finally have
a shot at something.

10:37.606 --> 10:39.240
You can't really think that.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.915
You're gonna need some
of this for Stanley, all right?

10:50.184 --> 10:51.352
So this is supposed
to be goodbye?

10:51.586 --> 10:55.856
No. No. I'll... I'll come back
and haunt you.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.661
Okay, listen,
they made me the reservation.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.429
I don't understand why
I have to put a credit card down

11:02.531 --> 11:04.465
- if it's already paid for.
- I'm sorry.

11:04.566 --> 11:06.267
- But it's company policy.
- Right.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.935
If you'd like,
I will call corporate

11:08.035 --> 11:09.370
- and triple-check.
- Please. Do it.

11:09.470 --> 11:10.971
Hello!
I can help you over here, sir.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.373
Hey. Uh, yeah.
I have a car reserved for me

11:12.406 --> 11:13.941
- for a noon pick-up.
- Great.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.577
I just need your credit card
and driver's license.

11:15.644 --> 11:18.513
Yeah. Ah... Here you go.

11:18.712 --> 11:19.847
Perfect. Thank you.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.849
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
This expires in a week.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.250
I won't be needing
it past then.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.985
You'll need
a valid driver's license

11:25.085 --> 11:27.154
that doesn't expire for two
months in order to rent a car.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.524
That makes no sense.
It's valid for when I need it.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.458
Just so you know, Blossom...

11:31.560 --> 11:32.459
Rose.

11:32.594 --> 11:33.727
...you have to have
a credit card

11:33.827 --> 11:35.429
if you want us
to rent you a car.

11:35.597 --> 11:37.364
This is insane.
This is literally insane.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.933
They made me the reservation.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.036
- Just one second.
- Thanks.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.075
All right?

11:48.677 --> 11:50.311
Are you two together?

11:50.477 --> 11:51.513
- Hey.
- Excuse me?

11:51.680 --> 11:52.780
She should be
so lucky.

11:53.047 --> 11:56.585
It seems the same company
has reserved both your cars.

11:56.685 --> 11:58.352
And they both have
the same destination.

11:59.688 --> 12:00.721
When's your appointment?

12:01.121 --> 12:03.991
- Um, seven days.
- Mine's in five.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.259
You a serial killer?

12:05.726 --> 12:07.895
Yeah, no. No, I say.
No, definitely not.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.664
No. Promise.
Never killed anyone.

12:09.897 --> 12:10.798
Shame.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.466
Well, maybe
we could help each other.

12:12.567 --> 12:13.635
In killing each other?

12:13.734 --> 12:16.804
Well, uh, no.
Getting to Dr. Stevensen's.

12:17.071 --> 12:19.406
- You're British, huh?
- Innit.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.477
Do you have earbuds?

12:26.013 --> 12:27.047
Awesome. So you, uh,

12:27.481 --> 12:29.316
you want to take the first shift
and then we'll do a swap out?

12:29.416 --> 12:32.152
- You can't drive.
- That's not true.

12:32.353 --> 12:33.787
I can turn the wheel
and everything.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.523
Can even stay
on the right side of the road.

12:35.624 --> 12:36.991
Or is it the left?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.259
I'm just kidding.

12:38.526 --> 12:41.095
We just need to get away
from these rental fuckers.

12:44.265 --> 12:45.199
Finally!

12:47.301 --> 12:48.102
An adventure, right?

12:48.335 --> 12:49.903
You know
what's at the end of this.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.106
Yeah, everything
I've ever wanted.

12:52.641 --> 12:53.774
You?

12:54.275 --> 12:55.142
It's Blossom, right?

12:55.543 --> 12:57.044
- Rose.
- Ah.

12:58.747 --> 13:00.281
I go by my middle name.

13:01.382 --> 13:03.484
Sweet.
So you prefer Rose or Rosie?

13:03.784 --> 13:04.785
Rose.

13:05.319 --> 13:06.655
By the way, uh, I'm Teddy.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.424
- That's a pretty name.
- I'm not interested.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.126
Excuse me?
I wasn't offering.

13:12.326 --> 13:13.794
Can you, uh,
crack your window, please?

13:14.028 --> 13:16.598
- It smells like smoke in here.
- Oh, that's actually not me.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.800
Um, I, uh, I... I don't smoke.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.604
Well, uh, I work with
some guys who do, and...

13:23.003 --> 13:25.272
Yeah, when they're not
lifting stuff, they, uh...

13:26.273 --> 13:27.174
they just light up.

13:27.542 --> 13:30.177
So, and I don't see the point
in doing laundry anymore, so.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.714
Oh. Please don't, uh.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.982
- Ah.
- Seventeen missed calls.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.690
<i>Oh, and thanks for the license.</i>

13:42.022 --> 13:45.259
<i>Yeah, I, uh, can't be arsed</i>
<i>with that paperwork shit, so.</i>

13:46.327 --> 13:47.428
<i>Yeah. Um...</i>

13:48.530 --> 13:50.230
<i>so, what do you do?</i>

13:50.497 --> 13:52.166
<i>Did? What... What did you do?</i>

13:52.399 --> 13:55.436
<i>Um, what did you do?</i>
<i>You're a mover?</i>

13:55.570 --> 13:57.304
<i>I actually, uh,</i>
<i>I used to have my own company.</i>

13:57.404 --> 14:00.474
<i>Had a few, actually.</i>
<i>And, uh, you know...</i>

14:00.709 --> 14:01.643
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

14:01.975 --> 14:03.077
<i>Sometimes you need</i>
<i>the extra cash, right?</i>

14:03.344 --> 14:04.912
<i>Do you want</i>
<i>to put those earbuds on?</i>

14:05.145 --> 14:06.815
<i>Maybe you can</i>
<i>use the Bluetooth.</i>

14:07.014 --> 14:09.718
<i>Hey, look,</i>
<i>there's an article about us.</i>

14:10.117 --> 14:14.589
<i>Human Rights Activist</i>
<i>Maya Cam. Camp-yon.</i>

14:14.823 --> 14:15.824
<i>- Cam... Camp-yon.</i>
<i>- Campion.</i>

14:16.190 --> 14:18.258
<i>Camp-yon... Campion</i>
<i>issued a formal statement</i>

14:18.459 --> 14:21.395
<i>declaring that the right</i>
<i>to die is a civil liberty.</i>

14:22.564 --> 14:23.565
<i>Damn straight.</i>

14:23.964 --> 14:25.399
<i>And who the fuck</i>
<i>are these senators</i>

14:25.600 --> 14:26.601
<i>who are trying to control us?</i>

14:27.736 --> 14:30.170
<i>People who don't believe,</i>
<i>or don't want to believe.</i>

15:14.783 --> 15:16.016
I got you chips.

15:20.522 --> 15:22.022
How can you eat that shit?

15:22.791 --> 15:24.291
What? Is there a better time?

15:25.660 --> 15:27.562
I wonder if cows
get to be ghosts.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.898
- Definitely not.
- How do you know?

15:30.197 --> 15:32.466
Because there'd be
a whole bunch of mad angry cows

15:32.667 --> 15:33.768
haunting the shit outta me.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.069
Ah. Hopefully pigs make the cut.

15:37.839 --> 15:39.406
Oh, it's an insult. I'm the pig.

15:39.541 --> 15:41.141
- It's just a thought.
- Hmm. Hmm.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.644
Just a thought.

15:42.744 --> 15:44.411
Any other thoughts?

15:44.579 --> 15:45.946
<i>Things have changed.</i>

15:46.213 --> 15:49.517
<i>If you have something left</i>
<i>to say to someone who's passed,</i>

15:49.884 --> 15:51.051
<i>we are here for you.</i>

15:51.519 --> 15:53.788
<i>Our three mediums</i>
<i>are standing by...</i>

15:53.888 --> 15:55.055
Hey, someone
really wants to chat.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.156
<i>...deliver your</i>
<i>messages to your</i>

15:56.190 --> 15:57.191
<i>loved ones on the other side.</i>

15:57.257 --> 15:58.992
Ah. The mystery
continues, eh?

15:59.226 --> 16:01.361
<i>- Retrial.</i>
<i>- Where are those earbuds?</i>

16:01.563 --> 16:02.564
I haven't seen them yet.

16:04.699 --> 16:08.368
- Willing driver.
- With no valid license.

16:08.636 --> 16:11.104
- Only on a technicality.
- I'm not taking any risks.

16:11.305 --> 16:12.674
Oh, right, yeah. Me driving.

16:12.774 --> 16:14.241
That's the biggest risk
right now.

16:16.410 --> 16:19.146
Did I tell you I also know
how to use the blinkers?

16:32.259 --> 16:34.428
- King or queen for you folks?
- Two rooms, please.

16:34.629 --> 16:38.098
- The further apart, the better.
- We're trying to conceive.

16:39.901 --> 16:43.671
- Two rooms that we do have...
- Whatever two rooms you have.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.442
Oh, um, if you find me
dead in the morning,

16:48.643 --> 16:51.278
she did it. Yeah.
Be sure to thank her for me.

16:59.954 --> 17:01.088
Oh.

17:04.592 --> 17:06.861
- 6:00 a.m., you got it?
- Just so I know,

17:06.961 --> 17:08.328
is it gonna be like this
the whole trip?

17:08.863 --> 17:11.398
I need to be in San Francisco
in four days for my appointment.

17:11.599 --> 17:14.002
That requires us
not fucking around. Okay?

17:14.334 --> 17:15.837
Anyway, that's not
what I'm talking about.

17:15.970 --> 17:16.971
What are you
talking about?

17:17.337 --> 17:19.574
You don't have to be
an asshole the whole time.

17:20.542 --> 17:22.209
Excuse me?

17:23.410 --> 17:24.177
You heard.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.113
Let me make something
really clear to you.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.916
We're not buddies.
We're not pals.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.384
We're not
in this together. Okay?

17:30.752 --> 17:31.485
Bollocks.

17:31.953 --> 17:34.087
How many people know what
it's like to be us right now?

17:35.657 --> 17:38.492
6:00 a.m., the car leaves.
Be in it or don't.

17:39.493 --> 17:40.795
- Sharp.
- Razor.

17:43.665 --> 17:47.367
Oh, my God! Stop following me.
I don't want to be your friend!

17:49.804 --> 17:50.738
What?

18:28.543 --> 18:30.210
<i>Rose.</i>

18:54.736 --> 18:56.470
<i>On the sector from Wall Street,</i>

18:56.571 --> 18:58.305
<i>the blue chips fell victim</i>
<i>to a sell-off...</i>

19:21.261 --> 19:22.396
<i>They are so easy...</i>

19:22.630 --> 19:24.132
<i>...at</i>
<i>the first pitch and fouled it</i>

19:24.231 --> 19:26.400
<i>deep back</i>
<i>into the stands behind...</i>

19:31.204 --> 19:32.707
<i>Hi, is this the front desk?</i>

19:33.206 --> 19:35.242
Is there anything good
to do around here?

19:35.510 --> 19:37.679
<i>Hey there,</i>
<i>I don't want this in my house.</i>

19:39.747 --> 19:41.149
<i>Sorry, but my grandmother...</i>

19:41.381 --> 19:43.051
<i>...why</i>
<i>this study is so important.</i>

19:43.250 --> 19:45.086
<i>So let's get to the question</i>

19:45.318 --> 19:47.254
<i>that's on</i>
<i>everyone's mind, I think.</i>

19:47.889 --> 19:51.092
<i>Are you asking people</i>
<i>to end their lives?</i>

19:52.060 --> 19:54.629
<i>I'd say</i>
<i>this is a beginning for some.</i>

19:56.097 --> 19:59.199
<i>So,</i>
<i>why can some people see ghosts?</i>

19:59.399 --> 20:02.537
<i>I still can't! So,</i>
<i>how do you explain that?</i>

20:02.837 --> 20:04.304
<i>Mm-hmm. That's right.</i>

20:04.539 --> 20:06.941
<i>Uh. Some of our participants</i>
<i>have had experiences</i>

20:07.141 --> 20:08.609
<i>with ghosts,</i>
<i>and others haven't.</i>

20:09.476 --> 20:11.746
<i>Uh. What we do know is</i>
<i>that not everyone comes back,</i>

20:11.946 --> 20:13.681
<i>and we have seen</i>
<i>that those who do come back</i>

20:13.948 --> 20:16.150
<i>have a strong connection</i>
<i>to Earth for a reason.</i>

20:16.851 --> 20:20.054
<i>Like... like Niko did</i>
<i>with his young son Reo here?</i>

20:20.253 --> 20:21.421
<i>Exactly. Uh, this is why</i>

20:21.622 --> 20:22.990
<i>the participants</i>
<i>in this controlled study</i>

20:23.191 --> 20:24.092
<i>are so important.</i>

20:24.592 --> 20:27.327
<i>They're ushering us into the</i>
<i>next era of human existence.</i>

20:27.595 --> 20:29.530
<i>These people are among</i>
<i>the bravest and most valiant</i>

20:29.731 --> 20:32.299
<i>men and women</i>
<i>in all of history.</i>

20:33.067 --> 20:34.068
<i>And it all started with</i>

20:34.468 --> 20:36.838
<i>young Reo letting you know</i>
<i>about his father visiting him?</i>

20:37.205 --> 20:38.271
<i>Yeah, that's right. Uh,</i>

20:38.472 --> 20:40.742
<i>our first big breakthrough</i>
<i>began when Reo's mom</i>

20:40.942 --> 20:43.644
<i>saw him playing a card game</i>
<i>that only his father knew.</i>

20:43.945 --> 20:46.114
<i>The strong connection</i>
<i>between Reo and his father</i>

20:46.313 --> 20:48.482
<i>brought them together</i>
<i>and the rest is, well,</i>

20:48.683 --> 20:51.986
<i>history in the making.</i>

20:52.486 --> 20:55.223
<i>Reo, how does it feel to be</i>

20:55.857 --> 20:57.892
<i>a part of such</i>
<i>a world-changing event?</i>

20:58.258 --> 21:00.094
<i>I just want to</i>
<i>see my dad again.</i>

21:00.360 --> 21:04.232
<i>Aw.</i>

21:05.066 --> 21:07.802
Kid's the biggest thing
in the world and he has no idea.

21:52.747 --> 21:54.949
Rose!

21:55.650 --> 21:56.584
Come on.

21:58.019 --> 22:00.755
Rose!

22:04.859 --> 22:06.493
6:00 a.m. sharp.

22:14.535 --> 22:17.004
Hi, how you doing?
Um, I've locked myself out.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.706
Do you mind just helping me?

22:18.940 --> 22:23.744
Yeah. Dying for a piss,
you know.

22:25.279 --> 22:27.081
- Thank you. Cheers.
- All right.

22:28.182 --> 22:31.853
Rose?

22:34.288 --> 22:35.590
Are you decent?

22:45.233 --> 22:46.366
Rose?

22:52.707 --> 22:54.909
Rose?

23:32.445 --> 23:34.481
Rooo...

23:37.685 --> 23:41.923
This is ridiculous.

23:46.093 --> 23:48.596
Uh. Oh, fuck.

23:54.101 --> 23:55.036
Oh, fuck.

23:58.839 --> 24:00.074
Fuck!

24:20.995 --> 24:22.096
Teddy!

24:54.695 --> 24:56.797
- I knocked a lot.
- Can we go?

24:56.998 --> 24:58.733
We're headed South, right?
Avoid the snow?

24:58.966 --> 25:01.002
Oh, God.
I need a Tylenol.

25:02.269 --> 25:03.471
You cool
if we miss New Mexico?

25:03.704 --> 25:05.840
I'm cool
to make sure we get there.

25:06.007 --> 25:08.843
Hmm. I think
I plotted us a good route.

25:09.276 --> 25:11.779
Awesome, let's go take it.

25:25.526 --> 25:27.895
I'm done. Let's go.

25:39.907 --> 25:42.676
I got the keys, asshole.

25:43.978 --> 25:45.012
<i>So you're saying</i>

25:45.112 --> 25:47.081
<i>that this irrational rise</i>
<i>in suicides...</i>

25:47.281 --> 25:49.016
<i>What's</i>
<i>irrational? People are in debt.</i>

25:49.116 --> 25:50.684
<i>Even if they do have</i>
<i>a job that pays,</i>

25:50.818 --> 25:52.286
<i>it's still not enough</i>
<i>to own a home.</i>

25:52.553 --> 25:53.954
<i>They can't support</i>
<i>their families.</i>

25:54.155 --> 25:56.757
<i>If there's no end, why not</i>
<i>consider the other option?</i>

25:57.124 --> 25:58.759
<i>It's easier than getting</i>
<i>Canadian citizenship.</i>

25:58.859 --> 25:59.927
<i>Uh.</i>

26:00.027 --> 26:01.328
<i>Why are we</i>
<i>gettin' off the highway?</i>

26:05.966 --> 26:06.700
Oh.

26:06.967 --> 26:09.170
If only there was someone else
who could drive.

26:09.703 --> 26:11.105
Such a shame.

26:14.642 --> 26:16.277
Do you think this means
other things could be real?

26:16.377 --> 26:17.478
Ghosts aren't enough?

26:17.711 --> 26:19.613
Like fairies, or, uh, jackalope.

26:19.814 --> 26:21.348
- That's stupid.
- Why's it stupid?

26:21.550 --> 26:24.553
Because jackalopes aren't even
proper mythological animals.

26:24.819 --> 26:26.887
Just invented
by a bored taxidermist.

26:27.054 --> 26:28.557
I bet you loved
telling other kids at school

26:28.656 --> 26:30.391
- Santa wasn't real either.
- Santa is real.

26:30.591 --> 26:31.926
He's a drunk pedophile
letting little kids

26:32.026 --> 26:33.594
sit on his lap
at the mall every year.

26:33.694 --> 26:35.663
I supposed the tooth fairy
is a crack whore as well.

26:38.766 --> 26:40.501
<i>So what made you want</i>
<i>to volunteer for the doc?</i>

26:40.701 --> 26:41.669
<i>What made you?</i>

26:42.103 --> 26:44.238
- You're good at that.
- Practice makes perfect.

26:46.707 --> 26:48.275
I want my life
to mean something.

26:48.909 --> 26:50.344
You know, to be a pioneer.

26:50.545 --> 26:52.279
To finally have my shot
at making...

26:52.514 --> 26:53.447
Have you practiced that?

26:53.848 --> 26:55.649
You got like an Instagram
handle for the afterlife?

26:55.883 --> 26:57.918
Oh, and your
reason's better, is it?

26:59.487 --> 27:00.654
Yes.

27:02.156 --> 27:03.592
- You're embarrassed.
- I'm not embarrassed.

27:03.724 --> 27:05.659
Hey, hey. It's okay.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.462
Is it pathetic?
Because mine is.

27:08.662 --> 27:11.265
No family. No kids. No home.

27:11.465 --> 27:13.767
You know, I was gonna come
to the States and make it big

27:13.968 --> 27:17.304
and have this perfect wife,
and travel the world.

27:18.607 --> 27:19.807
I've been here ten years,

27:20.040 --> 27:22.143
and I've never even left
New York State.

27:22.776 --> 27:25.446
And now?
Now, I finally get a chance

27:25.679 --> 27:28.349
to go to California
and be a part of something.

27:28.649 --> 27:31.352
Now that's fuckin'
beautifully pathetic.

27:31.586 --> 27:35.289
- There is no beauty in this.
- What? Why isn't it beautiful?

27:35.789 --> 27:38.259
I mean, it's not just the end,
it's the beginning.

27:38.359 --> 27:39.760
And doing it because
you don't wanna answer

27:39.894 --> 27:41.162
your fucking phone
is more pathetic than mine.

27:41.362 --> 27:44.198
- I lost everyone.
- So? I never even had anyone!

27:44.398 --> 27:45.499
- But I did!
- So?

27:45.600 --> 27:46.734
So why...
why are you doing this?

27:46.834 --> 27:48.936
Because I can't even
kill myself.

27:49.203 --> 27:50.605
I tried. I tried pills,

27:50.871 --> 27:52.940
chased with vodka
and rubbing alcohol.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.776
I was found three days later
in a pool of my own vomit

27:55.976 --> 27:57.411
with half-digested pills
everywhere.

27:57.646 --> 27:59.780
Only thing that happened was
that my landlord yelled at me

27:59.980 --> 28:01.583
for ruining his wood floors.

28:01.882 --> 28:02.850
So fuck 'em.

28:03.083 --> 28:05.152
I need someone to do it
for me because I can't.

28:05.352 --> 28:07.755
All I know is that
this hurts all the time.

28:07.988 --> 28:09.423
And I have tried
to fix it, but...

28:33.781 --> 28:35.115
- Whoa!
- It's not my fault.

28:35.216 --> 28:36.685
- Whoa!
- It's not my fault.

28:36.784 --> 28:39.820
I mean, I... I didn't mean to.
Oh, fuck.

28:42.856 --> 28:46.427
Fuck. I...
it was an accident. I...

28:46.894 --> 28:48.295
It wasn't an accident.

28:49.196 --> 28:50.565
Ye... yes, it was!

28:51.065 --> 28:53.734
No, no, no. You didn't...
No, you didn't mean to.

28:54.001 --> 28:55.736
This has been happening. Look.

29:01.275 --> 29:02.677
What a douche.

29:03.578 --> 29:07.381
I'm supposed to be fixing
my own shit, not other people's!

29:09.049 --> 29:11.252
Well, now I know what he meant
about the wood floors.

29:11.620 --> 29:12.786
Should we call the cops?

29:13.053 --> 29:15.690
"Hey, we just helped
some guy kill himself,

29:15.889 --> 29:19.059
but, uh, we're in a rush,
so can you give us a ride?"

29:19.994 --> 29:20.928
No!

29:21.730 --> 29:22.697
Come here.

29:22.896 --> 29:24.832
- Wait.
- We got to fix the tire.

29:30.170 --> 29:34.208
Okay.
This will work, yeah?

29:34.908 --> 29:38.546
- Yeah.
- Okay, so get it on there.

29:41.650 --> 29:42.850
Where's the jack?

29:44.285 --> 29:46.920
- Balls!
- Yeah. Big fat hairy balls.

29:47.388 --> 29:49.156
Did you see a garage
as we drove through?

29:49.390 --> 29:51.158
I saw five burger joints.

29:53.427 --> 29:54.828
So we walk or we wait.

29:57.766 --> 30:00.434
What do you think,
dead guy?

30:00.868 --> 30:02.936
Joe. Dead Joe.

30:03.605 --> 30:05.272
I feel like he's more of a Jack.

30:05.906 --> 30:08.075
What do you think, Dead Jack?

30:18.085 --> 30:19.887
Still no service?

30:24.693 --> 30:26.427
Fuck!

30:27.027 --> 30:29.129
Fuck! We have lost two hours.

30:29.330 --> 30:31.800
- We'll be okay.
- Breakfast didn't help.

30:32.132 --> 30:34.435
Neither did sleeping in
or Dead Joe.

30:35.302 --> 30:37.905
- Dead Jack.
- Dead Jack, fine.

30:39.173 --> 30:41.375
You want to walk over there
and see if we get some service?

30:41.743 --> 30:42.910
Do it.

30:45.913 --> 30:47.348
You know of all the ways
I would have killed myself,

30:47.448 --> 30:49.483
I never would have done
what Dead Jack did.

30:49.917 --> 30:53.287
- He could have killed us.
- Missed opportunity.

30:59.193 --> 31:01.128
What does rubbing alcohol
taste like?

31:02.029 --> 31:03.030
When you drank it?

31:03.364 --> 31:05.667
People always say, "That tastes
like rubbing alcohol."

31:06.200 --> 31:08.335
I was just wondering
if they were right.

31:15.142 --> 31:17.645
I was 11 when I first
tried to kill myself.

31:18.245 --> 31:20.648
I tried to overdose
with a bottle of vitamins.

31:20.981 --> 31:22.282
Yeah. It didn't work,

31:22.517 --> 31:25.085
but it did give me the shits
for about a week.

31:27.020 --> 31:28.623
Then about a few years ago,

31:29.089 --> 31:30.625
I jumped off a subway platform,

31:31.559 --> 31:34.027
but I mistimed it so I just
bounced off the subway car.

31:34.228 --> 31:35.295
Bullshit.

31:38.465 --> 31:41.135
When I was a kid, I tried to
slit my wrists with paperclips,

31:41.468 --> 31:43.370
but my arm got too tired
so I just gave up.

31:43.571 --> 31:46.674
That's a fucking cliché.

31:47.207 --> 31:49.143
The vodka was warm and cheap.

31:49.878 --> 31:51.145
It all tasted about the same.

31:51.412 --> 31:54.081
- Next time you should try lime.
- Hmm.

32:01.823 --> 32:03.023
Do you see that?

32:11.398 --> 32:12.332
Is that?

32:18.472 --> 32:19.339
Yeah.

32:19.973 --> 32:22.510
- Let me see what I can do.
- Yes.

32:22.877 --> 32:25.312
Thank you. Thank you.

32:28.449 --> 32:29.617
We've, uh...

32:30.618 --> 32:32.152
been calling him Jack.

32:33.822 --> 32:37.257
That's funny.
That's my name.

32:39.527 --> 32:41.094
Poor misguided soul.

32:41.830 --> 32:43.263
Think they'll find a better way.

32:43.531 --> 32:45.132
No shit.

32:46.066 --> 32:47.569
I mean a better way to live.

32:51.773 --> 32:52.941
Well, we're lucky
you came along.

32:53.173 --> 32:55.275
Yeah. Well, I walk
this road twice a day.

32:55.577 --> 32:58.613
We've had to cancel all
but two of our masses this week.

33:00.949 --> 33:03.050
I'd say you're overdue
for a reformation.

33:03.383 --> 33:04.686
It'd be nice to see
the Catholics

33:04.886 --> 33:06.220
do away with a few things.

33:06.420 --> 33:09.122
Like mortal sin,
condemning of birth control,

33:09.323 --> 33:12.159
or the idea
that suicides are damned.

33:14.729 --> 33:16.029
Yeah. Well...

33:17.264 --> 33:19.366
I already got rid
of that one actually.

33:23.938 --> 33:25.472
My little indulgence.

33:28.710 --> 33:31.478
So you're walking this road
every day hoping...

33:32.279 --> 33:34.248
What?
You'll end up finding Damascus?

33:34.949 --> 33:36.751
Uh. What's Damascus?

33:37.685 --> 33:38.385
Saint Paul.

33:38.887 --> 33:41.355
The risen Christ appeared
to him on the road to Damascus,

33:41.756 --> 33:43.056
showed him the light.

33:45.225 --> 33:48.095
Yeah, I guess
it's a little like that.

33:49.162 --> 33:51.164
Scientific discoveries
and religious reformations

33:51.265 --> 33:52.332
don't go hand in hand.

33:52.567 --> 33:54.501
Oh, seems to me that
the two could help each other.

33:54.702 --> 33:57.070
Then why did the Catholic Church
come out against Dr. Stevensen?

33:57.170 --> 33:58.540
Because she is playing God

33:58.640 --> 33:59.507
and hurting people.

33:59.707 --> 34:02.544
She's preying on the vulnerable.
Stealing His gift.

34:05.647 --> 34:08.816
Let me, uh, focus on this
so I can get you going.

34:11.184 --> 34:14.187
All right, we can do this.

34:14.589 --> 34:17.357
- Lift this. Ready?
- Yeah.

34:18.026 --> 34:19.961
Three, two, one.

34:20.160 --> 34:22.530
Jesus fucking Christ!

34:22.730 --> 34:25.098
Sorry.

34:25.700 --> 34:27.234
Okay, okay. It's in.

34:27.835 --> 34:30.004
Whoo!

34:30.270 --> 34:32.172
Don't worry
about the other Jack.

34:32.707 --> 34:33.708
I'll call it in.

34:36.010 --> 34:37.712
Would you hear my confession?

35:33.968 --> 35:34.869
Oh.

35:36.871 --> 35:38.138
So?

35:39.406 --> 35:40.340
Okay.

35:46.514 --> 35:49.651
So I guess
he's not done walking.

36:06.366 --> 36:07.935
Uh. Can you look up

36:08.136 --> 36:09.871
how we, uh,
get back to the highway?

36:10.203 --> 36:12.439
Mm. Yeah, straight ahead.
Route 90.

36:14.207 --> 36:16.678
I asked Jack earlier.
Father Jack. Not Dead Jack.

36:16.878 --> 36:17.812
Yeah.

36:23.316 --> 36:25.452
- So you're Catholic.
- Yeah.

36:26.453 --> 36:28.056
I've been confirmed
and everything.

36:28.355 --> 36:29.524
Hmm.

36:30.058 --> 36:32.292
So how many people do you think
breathed a sigh of relief

36:32.527 --> 36:35.295
when they found out they weren't
going to hell for their sins?

36:41.301 --> 36:43.303
Well, I've been
to a bar mitzvah.

36:46.273 --> 36:48.241
I made confession in Italy.

36:49.844 --> 36:51.512
I took a shit in a black cab.

36:55.016 --> 36:59.721
<i>I lit my sister's prom dress</i>
<i>on fire when I was 14.</i>

36:59.987 --> 37:00.888
<i>Why?</i>

37:01.388 --> 37:02.824
<i>You would have too,</i>
<i>if you would have seen it.</i>

37:04.324 --> 37:05.927
I kissed my grandma's friend.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.061
Yeah.

37:07.862 --> 37:10.363
- I've been on a yacht.
- Oh. Fancypants.

37:10.598 --> 37:12.365
I crossed the Thames
in an inflatable swan.

37:12.600 --> 37:13.634
No, you didn't.

37:13.868 --> 37:15.435
Yeah, I got arrested
and everything.

37:15.636 --> 37:17.739
Okay. I, uh,

37:17.939 --> 37:19.173
I... I've been to a cockfight.

37:19.372 --> 37:22.009
That is disgusting.

37:22.744 --> 37:25.479
- I've been to a rodeo.
- How is that not disgusting?

37:25.680 --> 37:28.248
I ate our goldfish.

37:29.050 --> 37:31.485
- Like, the family goldfish?
- Apparently, yeah.

37:31.753 --> 37:34.254
I've never been
to a baseball game.

37:34.589 --> 37:35.857
I've been to dozens.

37:36.157 --> 37:38.526
Wow, you really
love baseball.

37:38.960 --> 37:42.096
I hate baseball.
It's the dumbest game ever.

37:42.597 --> 37:46.000
The entire sport is designed to
make everybody else do nothing.

37:46.868 --> 37:49.904
The pitcher tries to throw the
ball so the batter can't hit it.

37:50.337 --> 37:52.106
The batter tries to hit
the ball out of the park

37:52.206 --> 37:53.608
so the catcher can't catch it.

37:53.841 --> 37:56.677
And the basemen guard the bases
so the runners can't run.

37:57.545 --> 38:00.581
It's designed to make everybody
stand around and do fuck-all.

38:02.282 --> 38:03.518
So why'd you go?

38:06.587 --> 38:07.789
'Cause that's what you do.

38:09.157 --> 38:10.525
<i>Okay, hold on. So,</i>

38:10.958 --> 38:13.426
uh, just carry on straight
down the highway.

38:13.661 --> 38:15.696
I do like your British
accent better than Siri's.

38:15.797 --> 38:17.430
I thought you didn't
like the British accent.

38:17.532 --> 38:19.534
But I like the way
you say the directions,

38:19.634 --> 38:20.367
just that.

38:20.701 --> 38:23.838
Continue down
this path for three days.

38:23.971 --> 38:24.705
Ugh.

38:24.872 --> 38:26.607
You can
just change regional.

38:26.707 --> 38:28.441
We can do Indian one as well.

38:28.543 --> 38:29.977
<i>You can.</i>
<i>You can put Indian Siri.</i>

38:30.077 --> 38:32.013
<i>- That's what I want.</i>
<i>- Turn left.</i>

38:32.113 --> 38:33.413
<i>Turn right.</i>

38:37.484 --> 38:40.922
Okay. Never have I ever
robbed a store.

38:45.693 --> 38:48.129
- Really?
- What? You presumed I had?

38:48.328 --> 38:49.597
Why? What gave you
the impression

38:49.697 --> 38:51.331
- that I would have...
- No. You know what?

38:51.431 --> 38:52.667
- ...robbed a store?
- I'm not gonna walk

38:52.767 --> 38:54.401
- into this trap.
- What were you basing that on?

38:54.501 --> 38:55.736
This is a trap.

38:56.137 --> 38:57.337
Um...

38:58.706 --> 39:00.908
never have I ever
had sex for money.

39:06.647 --> 39:11.018
No. Really?
Oh, I gotta hear this story.

39:11.252 --> 39:12.954
Fuck, no.

39:13.221 --> 39:14.856
All right. Okay.
I'm going there.

39:15.089 --> 39:15.857
Okay.

39:16.123 --> 39:20.427
Never have I ever had
an affair of any kind.

39:24.966 --> 39:26.767
Oh, you're bad.

39:27.034 --> 39:29.036
Never have I ever
been caught masturbating.

39:32.340 --> 39:33.241
Sorry.

39:33.841 --> 39:36.143
We used to play this
to pass time on patrol

39:36.344 --> 39:39.647
and, uh, guess
I was just playing along.

39:40.548 --> 39:41.883
Feel for you, brother.

39:42.750 --> 39:44.085
To cheeky wanks.

39:44.451 --> 39:46.254
Okay. Wait, wait.
Okay. Me, me, me.

39:46.453 --> 39:49.590
Mm-hmm.
- All right.

39:50.091 --> 39:51.192
Never have I ever.

39:51.491 --> 39:52.459
Never have I ever.

39:52.660 --> 39:53.895
- Are you with me, brother?
- Are you okay?

39:53.995 --> 39:55.495
- He's okay.
- Here we go.

39:55.596 --> 39:56.964
Never have I ever...

39:57.965 --> 39:59.200
peed my pants.

39:59.667 --> 40:04.071
As an adult, post-high school,
post-high school. Amen.

40:04.305 --> 40:06.707
Yeah. Of course.
Of course it's him.

40:10.077 --> 40:11.178
I thought we was a team.

40:14.582 --> 40:16.984
I fucking knew it.
I knew that was you.

40:17.084 --> 40:19.020
All right. Let's see
what other commandments

40:19.153 --> 40:21.454
we can break.

40:22.256 --> 40:23.758
We've got what?

40:24.191 --> 40:25.458
- Theft?
- Yes.

40:25.726 --> 40:26.794
- Sodomy.
- Sodomy.

40:26.994 --> 40:28.262
- Peeing.
- That's times two.

40:28.461 --> 40:29.830
- Yeah.
- Peeing.

40:30.197 --> 40:31.666
- You.
- Mm.

40:32.566 --> 40:34.501
Never have I ever...

40:35.236 --> 40:36.570
...killed a man.

40:39.774 --> 40:40.841
- To Jack.
- Mm.

40:41.075 --> 40:43.411
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Get the fuck out of here.

40:44.211 --> 40:47.048
Well...

40:52.987 --> 40:54.255
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

41:15.910 --> 41:18.112
Yikes. Yikes.

41:22.216 --> 41:23.217
How many is that?

41:23.651 --> 41:25.519
Four.

41:35.997 --> 41:37.431
You shot five men?

41:38.065 --> 41:41.535
Why do you always assume
we Texans are shooting people?

41:41.736 --> 41:42.937
Don't answer that.

41:45.573 --> 41:46.841
It was the sun.

41:47.808 --> 41:50.011
Twenty miles
from the border. Yeah.

41:50.745 --> 41:53.047
It was an accident.

41:54.582 --> 41:57.385
Not that it makes
any difference.

41:57.752 --> 41:59.220
I know this is gonna sound corny

41:59.920 --> 42:02.223
but I always wanted
to serve my country

42:02.556 --> 42:06.560
so I got asked to guard a wall.

42:09.330 --> 42:10.965
Mostly just processing people.

42:11.899 --> 42:14.268
So...
...these two,

42:14.368 --> 42:16.537
their access
is denied, you know.

42:16.737 --> 42:18.472
And we were just
following procedure.

42:19.006 --> 42:21.542
We've denied
this husband, wife access.

42:21.909 --> 42:23.310
And he's pretty mad

42:23.711 --> 42:25.713
but I don't speak Spanish
so I just...

42:25.980 --> 42:28.949
I just showed him
where the nearest exit was.

42:29.183 --> 42:30.384
Right?

42:30.818 --> 42:34.388
So the next day,
I'm on patrol. Standard.

42:34.822 --> 42:37.691
We see these two,

42:38.592 --> 42:40.161
and they're making a run for it.

42:40.428 --> 42:41.695
We go after them but...

42:41.962 --> 42:45.166
...they're goin'
the wrong damn way.

42:48.436 --> 42:49.737
And they, uh,

42:50.438 --> 42:52.973
they run
into this shed, all right.

42:53.974 --> 42:55.943
Come up with a plan.

42:56.811 --> 42:58.179
We're just gonna scare 'em.

42:58.712 --> 43:00.648
All right. We slam the door,

43:00.915 --> 43:04.218
you know, bang on the shed,
scream some shit.

43:08.122 --> 43:10.791
We were in the middle
of the desert.

43:11.058 --> 43:11.959
We knew...

43:13.494 --> 43:15.329
they weren't going nowhere.

43:15.763 --> 43:19.500
Next day, we... we head back
to the shed

43:20.067 --> 43:22.870
and, uh,
it was the afternoon by then.

43:25.406 --> 43:27.908
When we slammed the door shut...

43:32.179 --> 43:34.181
...it gets stuck.

43:35.883 --> 43:38.185
So we had to get
a crowbar to open it.

43:39.653 --> 43:42.857
And he's got
his arms wrapped around...

43:45.326 --> 43:46.694
three small kids.

43:48.496 --> 43:49.697
These kids...

43:51.832 --> 43:57.972
their bodies were empty.
Their faces were... melted.

44:03.444 --> 44:05.646
It was 135 degrees inside.

44:08.550 --> 44:10.017
We cooked them.

44:14.788 --> 44:16.123
Can you see them?

44:20.728 --> 44:21.862
Right there.

44:32.239 --> 44:33.440
That lady doctor...

44:35.676 --> 44:37.344
she may be able to see 'em...

44:37.978 --> 44:40.047
He's not okay.

44:41.715 --> 44:43.884
But she ain't got it all right.

44:45.719 --> 44:47.254
They're here to hurt us.

44:49.056 --> 44:50.991
And she's fucking letting 'em.

44:52.793 --> 44:54.728
I know how to solve it.

45:00.801 --> 45:02.303
John, you're cut off,

45:02.469 --> 45:03.404
- time to go.
- Sam.

45:05.039 --> 45:06.740
- What the fuck, man!
- Dammit...

45:07.007 --> 45:08.242
...not again, John!

45:08.409 --> 45:09.810
You're paying for that!

45:10.144 --> 45:10.844
Missed it.

45:11.011 --> 45:12.681
Every freakin' night.

45:13.380 --> 45:15.416
- Come on.
- Where's the gun?

45:16.951 --> 45:18.419
Yeah. Where is the fucking gun?

45:19.420 --> 45:20.589
Where's the gun?

45:20.788 --> 45:22.189
It's right there.

45:24.825 --> 45:26.794
Bottle?

45:27.696 --> 45:29.163
Don't make me ask twice.

45:30.565 --> 45:31.465
Oh.

45:34.001 --> 45:35.402
Time for you two to keep moving.

45:35.537 --> 45:36.403
Yes, ma'am.

45:36.538 --> 45:37.539
Time to go home.

45:37.738 --> 45:38.673
Give my gun.

45:38.806 --> 45:40.140
No. You get it tomorrow.

45:42.409 --> 45:43.777
Teddy. Hey.

45:44.111 --> 45:45.846
Teddy, let's go back
to the room.

45:48.749 --> 45:50.117
All right.

45:50.518 --> 45:52.086
Let's get you into your room.

45:52.953 --> 45:54.888
That guy was insane.

45:55.289 --> 45:59.159
He's just so scared.

45:59.994 --> 46:02.162
He held them
to the end. That dad.

46:03.430 --> 46:04.365
Foot.

46:04.465 --> 46:05.432
You know, my dad,

46:05.866 --> 46:08.536
he couldn't even wait
until I could ride a bike.

46:08.902 --> 46:11.539
I was a super-fast learner.

46:12.707 --> 46:13.907
Other foot.

46:14.808 --> 46:17.311
How could he have known
what was wrong with me...

46:18.846 --> 46:19.947
back then?

46:25.286 --> 46:27.221
- You know, it's weird.
- Hmm.

46:27.855 --> 46:29.957
I've never been so close to him.

46:32.026 --> 46:33.494
What do you mean, "close"?

46:36.598 --> 46:37.831
New Mexico.

46:41.869 --> 46:43.538
I always thought I was gonna,

46:44.639 --> 46:46.273
you know, make it big.

46:46.874 --> 46:49.009
Drive west and show him.

46:50.545 --> 46:52.179
You know, I got his address.

46:53.080 --> 46:55.916
Snuck it from
my mom's purse years ago.

46:56.751 --> 46:58.319
He sent it all back.

47:00.821 --> 47:02.423
All the letters I wrote...

47:04.793 --> 47:09.263
photos, drawings, unopened.

47:11.131 --> 47:14.968
He fucked off back to the States
where he came from

47:15.903 --> 47:18.540
and pretended like
we never even happened to him.

47:35.189 --> 47:37.291
You know, I coulda...

47:37.826 --> 47:39.960
college, I coulda worked.

47:40.294 --> 47:43.397
A smart job. A real job.
You know?

47:47.702 --> 47:49.336
If you saw your dad again,

47:50.137 --> 47:52.906
what would you say to him
if you had the chance?

47:53.775 --> 47:57.177
First, I'd break
his fucking jaw.

47:59.647 --> 48:00.981
And then I'd tell him,

48:01.716 --> 48:05.553
"I'd rather kill myself
than live the life you gave me."

49:29.671 --> 49:30.738
Oh, fuck.

49:44.853 --> 49:45.720
What?

49:49.757 --> 49:53.528
- What are you doing in my room?
- Oh, fuck.

49:55.462 --> 49:56.531
That's my bag.

49:59.266 --> 50:00.167
Fuck.

50:00.367 --> 50:03.003
Uh. I'm sorry.
What are you doing in my room?

50:03.203 --> 50:05.673
Fuck. Leaving.

50:05.940 --> 50:08.108
- Did you tuck me in?
- Fuck off.

50:08.308 --> 50:10.377
You did!

50:10.912 --> 50:13.280
My underpants are missing.
I'm joking. They're still on.

50:18.753 --> 50:21.789
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

50:23.958 --> 50:25.860
- Seriously, thank you.
- Yep.

50:28.997 --> 50:31.164
Okay, fine.
I'll drop it on one condition.

50:31.533 --> 50:33.333
- I hate conditions.
- Of course you do.

50:33.601 --> 50:35.837
Let's try and have
some fun today, please.

50:36.069 --> 50:37.104
You know how I feel about that.

50:37.505 --> 50:40.008
I do, but I don't want to be
like that guy last night. Okay?

50:40.340 --> 50:42.577
I don't want to hate life.
I want to embrace what's next.

50:43.210 --> 50:45.580
You're not that guy.
That guy's got PTSD.

50:52.787 --> 50:54.388
Okay, so what's fun?

51:05.232 --> 51:09.336
- I did it! Go!
- Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive.

51:10.170 --> 51:13.206
Whoo!

51:15.108 --> 51:18.178
You goddamn hooligans!

51:18.278 --> 51:20.280
That was fifteen bucks.

51:20.515 --> 51:23.383
<i>I'm still shaking.</i>

51:23.618 --> 51:25.687
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>ever picked up a hitchhiker?</i>

51:30.758 --> 51:32.794
- You need a ride?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

51:33.027 --> 51:34.929
- I'm Karma.
- Oh, uh, Teddy. Rose.

51:35.128 --> 51:36.064
- Hey.
- Hop in.

51:36.196 --> 51:37.130
Where you guys headed?

51:37.230 --> 51:38.198
- San Francis...
- California.

51:38.298 --> 51:39.767
Uh. We're in a hurry.

51:40.167 --> 51:42.537
I'm headed to Santa Fe,
that work for you?

51:43.170 --> 51:44.973
Um, I don't mean to pry.

51:45.238 --> 51:47.709
But did you guys
just rob that place?

51:48.076 --> 51:49.978
Yep. It's part of a process

51:50.078 --> 51:51.278
that we're working on.

51:51.546 --> 51:54.082
Do you mind shutting the door?
We... we really are in a hurry.

51:54.281 --> 51:55.382
Yeah. I wanted to rob a bank,

51:55.516 --> 51:56.985
but we settled
on a case of beer.

51:57.085 --> 51:59.119
Ah. So where's the beer?

52:04.559 --> 52:07.294
- So what's in Santa Fe?
- Oh, um,

52:07.494 --> 52:10.031
my aunt lives just outside
the national forest near there.

52:10.497 --> 52:13.968
She's a psychic,
healer, hippie chick.

52:14.201 --> 52:15.803
I'm gonna go meet her
and her friends.

52:16.037 --> 52:17.505
Oh, cool. What for?

52:18.238 --> 52:20.140
We're celebrating
a family ritual.

52:20.742 --> 52:24.045
- Sweet. Party in the desert.
- Yeah, kinda.

52:24.311 --> 52:26.246
It's important to reconnect
in moments like these.

52:26.346 --> 52:28.616
I mean, the universe,
there's so many shifts lately.

52:28.816 --> 52:31.552
Shifts. Yeah. Totally.

52:32.987 --> 52:34.488
So, uh, uh,
what you celebrating?

52:34.889 --> 52:35.923
The Quadrantids.

52:36.256 --> 52:38.626
Better than any other
meteor shower you've ever seen.

52:39.292 --> 52:41.095
It would be nice
to see some bright stars.

52:41.395 --> 52:43.397
They're not stars. No.

52:43.665 --> 52:46.734
It's, uh, it's dust, actually,
from the tail of a comet.

52:46.934 --> 52:47.969
Just ice and dust

52:48.235 --> 52:50.705
that's been left behind
from hundreds of years ago.

52:50.972 --> 52:52.106
Ice. Okay.

52:52.406 --> 52:55.308
- Sparkling cosmic leftovers.
- Shit. We need to get gas.

52:55.510 --> 52:57.712
I love that.
Sparkling leftovers.

52:58.345 --> 53:00.948
So you're going
to San Francisco?

53:01.314 --> 53:02.817
Are you two Participants?

53:03.885 --> 53:04.986
- Oh, you mean...
- Actually,

53:05.185 --> 53:06.888
it really depends
on what you mean.

53:07.088 --> 53:08.422
Dr. Stevensen's study.

53:08.723 --> 53:11.458
- I wouldn't do it.
- Well, you don't have to.

53:11.592 --> 53:13.293
Well, just not yet.
The science isn't there.

53:13.528 --> 53:14.829
It's being verified
more every day.

53:15.063 --> 53:18.900
Just because we can see them
doesn't mean we understand them.

53:19.167 --> 53:20.300
Over a hundred billion people

53:20.400 --> 53:22.003
have lived and died
on this planet.

53:22.202 --> 53:23.137
Where did they all go?

53:23.270 --> 53:25.372
There would
be ghosts everywhere.

53:26.206 --> 53:28.676
<i>You're talking about the</i>
<i>Earth as a closed system, but</i>

53:28.910 --> 53:31.478
<i>as you said,</i>
<i>the universe is infinitely vast</i>

53:32.180 --> 53:36.249
<i>and that's even if our rules of</i>
<i>time and space apply to theirs.</i>

53:38.318 --> 53:39.554
<i>I get it.</i>

53:40.320 --> 53:41.789
<i>I would just wait</i>
<i>till the science shakes out.</i>

53:42.023 --> 53:44.525
<i>Did you guys see that?</i>
<i>Is that a meteor?</i>

53:44.859 --> 53:46.828
<i>Oh, my God, you guys.</i>
<i>It's the Quadrantids.</i>

53:47.260 --> 53:48.261
<i>Let's go find a good spot</i>

53:48.328 --> 53:49.664
<i>to see them</i>
<i>before it gets dark.</i>

53:52.166 --> 53:53.467
Come on. Let's go look.

53:54.769 --> 53:55.670
Okay.

54:00.041 --> 54:01.475
She's not coming?

54:09.416 --> 54:11.119
Are you sure
you don't want to come?

54:11.384 --> 54:13.253
Uh. I gotta get
something inside.

54:14.155 --> 54:16.524
- You sure?
- Yeah, you go ahead.

54:18.425 --> 54:19.961
All right, I'll be back.

54:20.795 --> 54:21.796
Okay.

54:23.998 --> 54:24.799
Come on.

54:25.133 --> 54:27.201
Come see something worth seeing
before you end it all.

54:27.535 --> 54:28.836
It's really fucking cold.

54:28.936 --> 54:30.004
And windy.

54:49.389 --> 54:50.357
What is it?

54:50.892 --> 54:53.594
Oh, yeah.
I just realized I left my phone.

54:54.028 --> 54:56.798
Oh, it's okay.
You don't need your phone.

55:16.651 --> 55:19.654
You know, no matter what,

55:20.721 --> 55:23.490
what you do here still matters.

55:48.182 --> 55:49.717
Oh.

55:50.084 --> 55:52.385
It looks like I won't be
losing you two after all.

55:52.753 --> 55:55.723
A federal judge has denied
Dr. Stevensen's injunction.

55:56.023 --> 55:58.559
They're saying it is likely
only a matter of days

55:58.759 --> 56:02.395
before the trials
will be shut down. See?

56:07.235 --> 56:08.435
Don't tell Rose.

56:18.212 --> 56:20.715
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi. I'm looking for someone.

56:20.948 --> 56:22.884
I'm not sure
if he still lives here.

56:28.455 --> 56:29.590
You coming?

56:30.858 --> 56:31.993
No.

56:32.727 --> 56:35.129
I'm not that far.
They can come get me from here.

56:35.930 --> 56:38.833
Enjoy the journey.

56:39.934 --> 56:40.935
All right.

56:56.851 --> 57:00.187
- Where's Karma going?
- On a star mission.

57:03.824 --> 57:07.194
Fuck, it was amazing.
I wish you had been there.

57:17.939 --> 57:19.974
- Teddy, I found your father.
- Hey, would you...

58:13.527 --> 58:14.996
Uh. For the gas.

58:16.330 --> 58:17.365
Um.

58:17.665 --> 58:20.101
Do you know anyone by
the name of Joe who works here?

58:20.301 --> 58:21.302
Joe? Yeah.

58:21.435 --> 58:22.937
He's on his way down to Molly's.

58:23.437 --> 58:24.772
Down that way, you'll see him.

58:25.639 --> 58:26.941
How do you know Joe?

58:27.775 --> 58:28.743
Family.

58:37.952 --> 58:39.787
Do you know
what you're gonna say?

58:43.257 --> 58:44.258
Yeah, um...

58:45.593 --> 58:46.961
No, I know exactly.

58:50.231 --> 58:51.265
I mean, I thought...

58:51.766 --> 58:53.267
I thought
it'd be different, but...

58:55.336 --> 58:56.203
I'm ready.

58:58.172 --> 59:01.008
I'm ready to tell him
that he's not forgiven.

59:01.208 --> 59:02.676
That he fucked up.

59:03.577 --> 59:05.012
That he's the reason.

59:08.649 --> 59:09.850
Okay.

59:10.951 --> 59:12.053
I'm gonna go in.

59:12.420 --> 59:13.320
Get a seat.

59:14.388 --> 59:15.856
Watch the fireworks.

59:16.490 --> 59:18.759
Teddy...

59:19.960 --> 59:20.861
enjoy this.

1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:40.875
Mind if I sit here?

1:00:44.478 --> 1:00:47.081
- Now you mention it.
- Do we have a fucking problem?

1:00:49.683 --> 1:00:50.851
You tell me.

1:00:53.888 --> 1:00:55.656
You don't recognize me, do you?

1:00:58.926 --> 1:01:00.928
I've waited over 30 years

1:01:01.262 --> 1:01:04.698
to say some things, so I suggest
you shut your mouth, Joe.

1:01:06.734 --> 1:01:08.035
I'm Charlie.

1:01:09.870 --> 1:01:11.305
Joe's in the corner.

1:01:14.008 --> 1:01:15.342
Hope he breaks your nose.

1:01:48.842 --> 1:01:50.044
What are you drinking?

1:01:51.580 --> 1:01:52.713
Whiskey.

1:01:53.847 --> 1:01:55.316
- Whiskey?
- Yeah.

1:01:56.016 --> 1:01:57.718
Speak up.

1:02:16.837 --> 1:02:19.173
Paul! Paul!

1:02:19.541 --> 1:02:23.844
- Oh, man. Royal flush.
- Holy shit.

1:02:24.044 --> 1:02:26.514
- No way.
- No, I told you, man.

1:02:26.847 --> 1:02:27.848
Royal flush.

1:02:28.048 --> 1:02:29.049
Yeah, that's great.

1:02:29.183 --> 1:02:30.518
I've never seen
one on there before.

1:02:30.751 --> 1:02:32.419
- Joe, that's wonderful.
- Yes.

1:02:32.621 --> 1:02:34.088
Congratulations, man.

1:02:36.323 --> 1:02:37.825
Four years they've had
these machines

1:02:38.025 --> 1:02:40.261
and no one hit a royal flush
before. It's, uh...

1:02:40.461 --> 1:02:41.996
Whoa.

1:02:42.229 --> 1:02:45.899
Hey, Paul. I... I...
It's got me 5,000.

1:02:46.267 --> 1:02:48.102
You know,
you can't use it for nothing.

1:02:48.335 --> 1:02:51.573
Still. You know...
give me another round,

1:02:51.706 --> 1:02:53.474
uh, to celebrate.

1:02:55.577 --> 1:02:57.278
And one for you too, Paul.

1:02:58.846 --> 1:03:01.015
And you,
what are you drinking, huh?

1:03:01.482 --> 1:03:02.850
What is that, whiskey?

1:03:04.451 --> 1:03:07.254
Oh. And another one
for my young friend over here.

1:03:09.056 --> 1:03:12.326
Oh, haven't seen one of those.

1:03:13.695 --> 1:03:15.996
Just haven't seen one. Wow.

1:03:23.904 --> 1:03:27.174
Hey, what happened?

1:03:28.809 --> 1:03:31.178
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- You had him.

1:03:31.546 --> 1:03:33.314
It doesn't matter
where we're going.

1:03:33.548 --> 1:03:34.448
Teddy.

1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:42.856
You need to say it
as much as he needs to hear it.

1:03:43.090 --> 1:03:46.226
Especially because you are dying
and he is the reason why.

1:04:02.544 --> 1:04:03.545
Where's Joe?

1:04:04.646 --> 1:04:06.413
End of the night.
Time to get out.

1:04:06.614 --> 1:04:09.283
- Where did he go?
- Couldn't say.

1:04:09.551 --> 1:04:11.919
- Don't know, or couldn't say?
- Just who are you, friend?

1:04:12.286 --> 1:04:14.388
Some piece of shit,
got a hard-on for Joe.

1:04:14.589 --> 1:04:15.824
Who the fuck asked you?

1:04:16.023 --> 1:04:17.391
Boy,
it's time to move on.

1:04:17.592 --> 1:04:19.226
Don't fucking call me boy.

1:04:19.828 --> 1:04:21.495
- Yeah, that's right.
- Hey. Teddy...

1:04:21.663 --> 1:04:22.863
Go on and fucking hit me! Go on!

1:04:22.963 --> 1:04:24.198
- Hey!
- Fucking hit me!

1:04:24.298 --> 1:04:26.233
Enough!

1:04:27.334 --> 1:04:28.268
He's leaving.

1:04:29.970 --> 1:04:32.172
- Now!
- Ladies.

1:04:34.908 --> 1:04:37.612
Nice boyfriend. Tough guy, huh?

1:04:40.080 --> 1:04:41.448
Get the fuck
out of here. Get out.

1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:08.409
- Teddy, I didn't know...
- You wanted me to do that.

1:05:10.077 --> 1:05:11.245
You wanted to see me...

1:05:11.546 --> 1:05:13.247
- ...fucking fail, didn't you?
- Hey. Hey, take a breath.

1:05:13.347 --> 1:05:16.150
Don't tell me what to do.
I don't need your help.

1:05:23.390 --> 1:05:24.191
I'm sorry.

1:05:24.592 --> 1:05:26.661
Okay? I thought that was
going to be good for you.

1:05:28.028 --> 1:05:29.196
Good for me?

1:05:30.899 --> 1:05:32.132
You thought that...

1:05:32.834 --> 1:05:34.034
was good for me?

1:05:35.670 --> 1:05:36.571
What?

1:05:37.137 --> 1:05:39.674
You got bored
with what, alienating me

1:05:39.874 --> 1:05:41.709
so you thought
you'd wind me up for fun

1:05:41.942 --> 1:05:43.410
and see me wrestle
some daddy issues?

1:05:43.611 --> 1:05:44.712
You're fucking sick.

1:05:45.847 --> 1:05:50.451
Blossom, how do you make
suicide pretentious?

1:05:50.885 --> 1:05:53.688
- I don't know. Ask Blossom.
- Okay.

1:05:53.954 --> 1:05:56.056
I'm so fucking tortured.

1:05:56.323 --> 1:05:57.892
I don't even know
what to do about it.

1:05:58.125 --> 1:05:59.727
You are not even mad at me,
Teddy.

1:05:59.928 --> 1:06:01.995
- So don't act so stupid.
- Stupid?

1:06:02.229 --> 1:06:05.365
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me? Fuck me?

1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:07.635
I didn't want you.

1:06:08.703 --> 1:06:12.574
The worst day of my life was
finding out you were coming.

1:06:12.841 --> 1:06:14.107
I almost hit your mother.

1:06:14.308 --> 1:06:16.511
- What are you doing?
- Why would I want you?

1:06:16.778 --> 1:06:18.746
You fucking lifelong parasite.

1:06:19.112 --> 1:06:21.281
She'd say, "Oh, he's gonna be
something amazing."

1:06:21.482 --> 1:06:24.786
But I knew better. I could
see it. You were nothing.

1:06:25.319 --> 1:06:28.121
- Are you mental?
- I didn't want you,

1:06:28.322 --> 1:06:32.961
you stupid, fucking, pathetic...
you worthless, pathetic...

1:06:33.227 --> 1:06:35.162
- I deserved a life!
- ...piece of shit!

1:06:35.362 --> 1:06:36.898
- Fucking failure!
- I needed you.

1:06:37.164 --> 1:06:38.098
She needed you!

1:06:38.332 --> 1:06:40.434
She had to work
two jobs to keep us going.

1:06:40.635 --> 1:06:44.539
I never saw her. I was alone.
You can't grow right

1:06:44.639 --> 1:06:46.340
- when you're alone.
- You were a defect.

1:06:46.541 --> 1:06:48.910
No. Nothing was wrong
with me back then.

1:06:49.176 --> 1:06:52.212
I was perfect.

1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:54.782
You know, I spent so long...

1:06:56.016 --> 1:06:58.485
trying to show you
that I was better than you.

1:06:59.286 --> 1:07:02.524
I tried so hard to be perfect.
And I fucked it up.

1:07:05.793 --> 1:07:08.730
You know what?

1:07:11.599 --> 1:07:14.602
I don't give a shit
about what you did.

1:07:15.603 --> 1:07:19.039
I didn't need you then
and I don't need you now.

1:07:50.605 --> 1:07:51.739
<i>What about you?</i>

1:07:53.007 --> 1:07:55.643
<i>No. No daddy issues.</i>

1:07:56.911 --> 1:07:57.812
He's dead.

1:07:58.980 --> 1:07:59.981
I'm sorry.

1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:02.550
Hmm. It's okay.
I didn't know him.

1:08:03.017 --> 1:08:04.284
We didn't need him.

1:08:05.118 --> 1:08:07.220
It was always just
my amazing mom...

1:08:08.455 --> 1:08:12.225
and her perfect daughter,
and what was left.

1:08:16.296 --> 1:08:18.432
I used to get into these fights.

1:08:19.333 --> 1:08:22.135
My sister was always
bringing home awards, and...

1:08:23.071 --> 1:08:24.171
I was the one who got expelled

1:08:24.404 --> 1:08:27.240
for busting a girl's cheek open
with a lunch tray.

1:08:28.710 --> 1:08:31.378
So I'm not the only one
who pisses you off?

1:08:31.713 --> 1:08:33.447
No. Sadly.

1:08:33.982 --> 1:08:35.850
I messed up
my college scholarship.

1:08:36.149 --> 1:08:37.986
I was left
with a mountain of debt

1:08:38.185 --> 1:08:40.722
and then I... I missed it.

1:08:43.591 --> 1:08:45.827
She died. My mom.

1:08:48.763 --> 1:08:50.163
I didn't say goodbye.

1:08:54.035 --> 1:08:55.937
I was just so ashamed and...

1:08:56.871 --> 1:09:01.408
scared that they'd judge me
so I didn't pick up their calls.

1:09:02.877 --> 1:09:05.178
I was so stupid. I...

1:09:14.555 --> 1:09:15.657
Do you see her?

1:09:19.459 --> 1:09:21.328
I just want
to make things right.

1:09:24.398 --> 1:09:26.400
It showed up
after your mom died?

1:09:29.637 --> 1:09:34.174
After my mom,
I lost my jobs and my apartment.

1:09:35.475 --> 1:09:38.178
And she took me in.
My... My sister.

1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:44.585
I hadn't seen her in years.
And, just like that,

1:09:44.786 --> 1:09:46.821
she gives me a room
in her house, this...

1:09:47.789 --> 1:09:48.923
gorgeous house.

1:09:50.457 --> 1:09:52.827
My sister and her husband,
Nick, they look like

1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:55.630
a jeans commercial
for the perfect family,

1:09:55.830 --> 1:09:58.365
complete with
their beautiful daughter.

1:09:59.366 --> 1:10:01.301
And it was going well.

1:10:02.036 --> 1:10:03.203
Really well.

1:10:04.839 --> 1:10:05.873
And then this one week,

1:10:06.107 --> 1:10:08.475
Heather goes out of town
for business.

1:10:08.676 --> 1:10:10.578
And... and Nick.

1:10:14.115 --> 1:10:15.315
Suddenly this...

1:10:16.617 --> 1:10:17.719
this shift.

1:10:18.986 --> 1:10:20.888
<i>He starts letting off steam.</i>

1:10:21.589 --> 1:10:25.459
<i>Heather's always right</i>
<i>and he's always wrong.</i>

1:10:26.194 --> 1:10:28.596
I get so pissed off at Heather

1:10:28.796 --> 1:10:30.998
who ended up
with this perfect life

1:10:31.199 --> 1:10:32.365
and I just think,

1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:35.536
why can't I just have that,
even just for a night?

1:10:36.336 --> 1:10:39.907
<i>And I lean into him.</i>

1:10:43.544 --> 1:10:46.581
<i>I wake up</i>
<i>with a hole in my stomach</i>

1:10:46.948 --> 1:10:48.348
and Nick is fine...

1:10:49.751 --> 1:10:51.018
like nothing happened.

1:10:53.955 --> 1:10:55.623
And that's when I see it.

1:10:57.058 --> 1:10:58.526
This darkness.

1:10:59.627 --> 1:11:00.795
Staring at me.

1:11:01.896 --> 1:11:03.564
It... It knows.

1:11:04.699 --> 1:11:06.567
It knows I've got
a self-destruct button

1:11:06.801 --> 1:11:07.902
in my heart...

1:11:09.269 --> 1:11:11.471
and it's fucking irresistible.

1:11:15.475 --> 1:11:16.944
Oh, I can be happy...

1:11:18.746 --> 1:11:19.847
for a minute,

1:11:20.581 --> 1:11:22.049
a day, maybe even a year...

1:11:24.685 --> 1:11:27.021
but sooner or later,
I'm pushing that button.

1:11:32.459 --> 1:11:34.629
You never spoke
to your sister after that?

1:11:37.231 --> 1:11:38.331
No.

1:11:41.602 --> 1:11:43.838
I kept waiting for that call.

1:11:45.106 --> 1:11:47.307
But no, her calls are concerned.

1:11:49.911 --> 1:11:51.579
And that's worse somehow.

1:11:58.318 --> 1:12:00.655
I just don't want
to hurt anymore.

1:12:22.243 --> 1:12:23.376
Hey.

1:12:23.611 --> 1:12:27.815
Um, look, I, uh,
I need to say something to you.

1:12:28.049 --> 1:12:29.717
I don't want to talk
about that stuff anymore.

1:12:29.917 --> 1:12:32.119
No. No, no, no. I need
to tell you something else.

1:12:32.452 --> 1:12:34.387
I don't wanna talk
about that stuff either.

1:13:14.662 --> 1:13:15.663
<i>Hello?</i>

1:13:16.030 --> 1:13:18.866
Milton...
...you handsome bastard.

1:13:19.367 --> 1:13:20.968
<i>I knew I'd hear from you.</i>

1:13:21.669 --> 1:13:23.704
Yeah, we're just
on our way to Arizona now.

1:13:24.205 --> 1:13:25.539
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

1:13:27.241 --> 1:13:28.809
<i>Ah. Um,</i>

1:13:29.442 --> 1:13:30.645
<i>I've met someone.</i>

1:13:31.345 --> 1:13:33.147
<i>That's fantastic.</i>

1:13:33.681 --> 1:13:35.816
<i>But I think</i>
<i>you'd really like her. She's...</i>

1:13:36.984 --> 1:13:37.985
<i>She's smart.</i>

1:13:39.153 --> 1:13:39.820
Real.

1:13:40.288 --> 1:13:43.190
<i>That's wonderful. I told you.</i>
<i>You just never know.</i>

1:13:46.294 --> 1:13:48.029
<i>So are you two coming back?</i>

1:13:50.631 --> 1:13:52.366
<i>Will I get to meet this girl?</i>

1:13:52.465 --> 1:13:53.634
Hey, um, no. I've gotta go.

1:13:53.801 --> 1:13:54.936
- Can you, uh, kiss...
- <i>Teddy!</i>

1:13:55.002 --> 1:13:57.470
- ...Stanley for me, okay?
<i>- Teddy.</i>

1:13:59.740 --> 1:14:01.509
- That's a choice.
- I feel like it's fitting.

1:14:01.742 --> 1:14:04.078
Yeah. Oh, I'm glad.
Yeah, that's...

1:14:04.312 --> 1:14:05.713
Oh, I've got one too. Fantastic.

1:14:05.947 --> 1:14:06.681
- Twins.
- Yeah.

1:14:06.814 --> 1:14:07.748
It's just what
I wanted actually.

1:14:08.082 --> 1:14:09.550
Yeah. I was gonna ask you
when you were going in

1:14:09.684 --> 1:14:10.885
could you grab me
a pair of these?

1:14:10.952 --> 1:14:12.320
- Looks great on you.
- Perfect.

1:14:12.420 --> 1:14:13.654
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:14:35.009 --> 1:14:38.145
Hey. Teddy, we're here.

1:14:49.590 --> 1:14:50.825
What?

1:14:51.058 --> 1:14:52.093
Rose!

1:14:52.526 --> 1:14:54.462
Rose!

1:14:54.729 --> 1:14:56.931
Hey!

1:14:57.465 --> 1:14:59.166
What is this? Where are we?

1:15:04.305 --> 1:15:05.206
Oh.

1:15:06.707 --> 1:15:08.009
Who is it?

1:15:10.311 --> 1:15:12.947
Oh, my God.

1:15:13.681 --> 1:15:15.116
Oh, my God. It's you!

1:15:15.316 --> 1:15:17.518
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

1:15:18.252 --> 1:15:19.387
Come inside.

1:15:19.687 --> 1:15:22.623
Steph, come downstairs.
Your Aunty Firefly is here.

1:15:22.957 --> 1:15:24.492
Come in. Hi.

1:15:24.759 --> 1:15:26.927
Hi. Oh, my God.

1:15:27.161 --> 1:15:31.165
- Oh, look how big you are!
- Where have you been?

1:15:31.365 --> 1:15:32.533
She's here.

1:15:32.767 --> 1:15:34.635
Oh, uh, can I get you guys
something to drink?

1:15:34.869 --> 1:15:37.204
- A coffee maybe?
- Hi, kiddo.

1:15:37.605 --> 1:15:38.939
Oh, look at that.

1:15:39.106 --> 1:15:39.807
Look at that.

1:15:40.041 --> 1:15:41.642
Um, maybe a glass of wine
would be good.

1:15:41.742 --> 1:15:43.277
You have to see my room,
we changed it!

1:15:43.377 --> 1:15:44.645
- You have to see!
- Okay.

1:15:44.779 --> 1:15:47.748
Bring her back. Mommy wants
to see her, too.

1:15:48.115 --> 1:15:49.050
Whoo!

1:15:54.822 --> 1:15:56.490
You know, I forgot my manners.

1:15:56.690 --> 1:15:58.059
- Heather. Hi.
- Oh. Teddy.

1:15:58.159 --> 1:15:58.926
- Teddy?
- Yes.

1:15:59.126 --> 1:16:00.561
Sounds like
there's a story. Come inside.

1:16:00.661 --> 1:16:02.229
Nick.

1:16:02.496 --> 1:16:03.798
Okay.

1:16:22.083 --> 1:16:22.950
Hmm.

1:16:23.751 --> 1:16:25.286
How many
messages did we leave?

1:16:25.554 --> 1:16:26.720
We left a lot.

1:16:27.288 --> 1:16:29.223
Just wish you would
have let us know you were okay.

1:16:29.390 --> 1:16:30.291
That's all.

1:16:30.424 --> 1:16:32.026
You owed us
more than that, Rosie.

1:16:35.229 --> 1:16:37.131
You have an amazing house.

1:16:37.566 --> 1:16:40.434
Amaz... Amazing house.
It's, um, amazing.

1:16:40.668 --> 1:16:41.669
It was a steal.

1:16:41.869 --> 1:16:44.004
They all are
up here in the desert.

1:16:44.672 --> 1:16:46.273
Apparently, nobody
likes living this far.

1:16:46.508 --> 1:16:48.008
But we think it's gorgeous.

1:16:49.243 --> 1:16:50.644
You ever been to Arizona?

1:16:51.712 --> 1:16:54.615
No. No. Fir... first time.

1:16:55.049 --> 1:16:57.384
- More wine?
- Oh, uh, no.

1:16:58.285 --> 1:16:59.620
Well, it's an occasion.

1:16:59.820 --> 1:17:01.489
Of course it is.
I'm so happy to see you.

1:17:01.722 --> 1:17:04.458
- It's... been too long.
- That's not what I meant.

1:17:04.892 --> 1:17:07.128
- Well, do tell.
- Well, actually, uh,

1:17:07.228 --> 1:17:08.829
Rose and I have
a lot of ground to cover

1:17:09.029 --> 1:17:10.131
- tonight...
- Mm-mm.

1:17:10.364 --> 1:17:12.032
- You can't be serious.
- We've got time.

1:17:12.266 --> 1:17:14.502
Well, no, no.
I've got stuff to do tonight.

1:17:14.603 --> 1:17:15.970
And I don't...
I don't feel well.

1:17:16.170 --> 1:17:17.338
Yeah, well, suck it up.

1:17:18.939 --> 1:17:21.775
Big baby.

1:17:21.976 --> 1:17:23.677
- Such a baby.
- Oh.

1:17:23.878 --> 1:17:25.446
God, this is a story.

1:17:25.679 --> 1:17:26.947
Yeah, well,

1:17:27.047 --> 1:17:28.883
it's a doozy
of a story how we met, huh?

1:17:28.983 --> 1:17:30.519
I don't know that
I could tell that right.

1:17:30.619 --> 1:17:31.652
No, you can't so...

1:17:31.785 --> 1:17:33.988
No, no. I can. I can.
I can tell it right.

1:17:34.088 --> 1:17:35.923
Um, so the...

1:17:37.658 --> 1:17:39.860
the thing is Teddy
and I are, uh, taking a trip.

1:17:40.094 --> 1:17:41.028
And, um...

1:17:43.030 --> 1:17:46.200
I really needed to see you
before we go where we're going.

1:17:47.668 --> 1:17:49.103
- Where are you going?
- Rose...

1:17:49.203 --> 1:17:52.473
It's difficult to say.
Um, I'm just gonna say it.

1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:55.876
- You know, I left the grill on.
- No, no, I'll be fast.

1:17:57.945 --> 1:17:59.346
Where are you going?

1:18:03.585 --> 1:18:04.718
Rose,
where are you going?

1:18:04.852 --> 1:18:07.021
Just, my God! Out with it.

1:18:09.156 --> 1:18:10.024
Rose!

1:18:10.691 --> 1:18:11.926
We're eloping.

1:18:14.728 --> 1:18:18.032
What? That's...
That's amazing.

1:18:18.533 --> 1:18:19.400
When?

1:18:19.668 --> 1:18:22.903
Uh. We're going
to Vegas tonight.

1:18:23.103 --> 1:18:24.772
Gonna do a drive-through
wedding thing.

1:18:25.005 --> 1:18:26.508
Oh, my God, that's insane.

1:18:26.641 --> 1:18:29.009
Yeah. We're selling the car.

1:18:29.310 --> 1:18:31.345
And, uh, then
we're gonna go to Europe.

1:18:31.613 --> 1:18:33.047
Yeah, I've always
wanted to go to France.

1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:35.617
And then we're gonna go
to Oxford where Teddy's from.

1:18:35.849 --> 1:18:39.086
Uh. London. London is where
Teddy's from.

1:18:42.056 --> 1:18:43.924
We've known each other
less than a month.

1:18:44.892 --> 1:18:46.927
- Holy shit, Rose.
- Yeah.

1:18:47.194 --> 1:18:49.363
I didn't know at first.
I mean, how do you ever know?

1:18:49.564 --> 1:18:50.532
Uh.

1:18:50.998 --> 1:18:54.735
But this one night, he, uh,
told me his truth, and...

1:18:55.836 --> 1:18:57.738
I told him
the worst thing about me,

1:18:57.938 --> 1:19:01.041
and, uh, it was okay, so.

1:19:01.742 --> 1:19:03.277
You marry that person.

1:19:08.382 --> 1:19:09.183
We don't have jobs there yet.

1:19:09.517 --> 1:19:11.586
But, uh, we've got enough money
for about six months.

1:19:11.785 --> 1:19:13.354
And I'm... I'm just gonna...

1:19:13.854 --> 1:19:15.690
...look for a teaching job.

1:19:16.223 --> 1:19:19.226
And Teddy's got this
brilliant idea for a startup,

1:19:19.793 --> 1:19:21.428
so he's gonna get
that going there.

1:19:22.096 --> 1:19:23.063
And, um...

1:19:24.064 --> 1:19:26.200
we've been making these lists.

1:19:26.601 --> 1:19:29.470
Um, things we've always
wanted to do.

1:19:30.004 --> 1:19:31.372
We've been doing that together.

1:19:32.172 --> 1:19:34.908
For some reason, we've never
let ourselves do that before.

1:19:39.146 --> 1:19:40.047
That's it.

1:19:40.814 --> 1:19:43.551
That's why I wanted to see you.

1:19:44.753 --> 1:19:45.754
Both.

1:19:46.387 --> 1:19:49.290
I'm so happy for you.
It's crazy.

1:19:49.490 --> 1:19:52.960
It's not... not bad crazy.
It's just... it's amazing.

1:19:53.327 --> 1:19:54.895
Yeah.

1:19:55.530 --> 1:19:56.497
Mm-hmm.

1:20:07.709 --> 1:20:08.876
Well, you, uh,

1:20:09.076 --> 1:20:10.477
you take care of her now.
You promise.

1:20:11.445 --> 1:20:12.479
I'll do my best.

1:20:13.447 --> 1:20:14.549
It's nice to meet you, man.

1:20:15.717 --> 1:20:16.950
Hey, Ladybug.

1:20:22.022 --> 1:20:24.124
I just wanted to say, um...

1:20:29.863 --> 1:20:32.066
You know
that every time you disappear,

1:20:32.299 --> 1:20:34.234
another little piece
of my heart breaks.

1:20:34.435 --> 1:20:37.237
And when you used to do this,
I would call Mom.

1:20:38.072 --> 1:20:41.075
Heather, um, I know
that I've made your life

1:20:41.308 --> 1:20:44.612
a living hell most of the time
but I... I left last time.

1:20:44.912 --> 1:20:46.447
- Nick and I, we...
- We're good.

1:20:47.481 --> 1:20:48.717
- What?
- He's my husband.

1:20:48.817 --> 1:20:50.184
This is my family.

1:20:51.919 --> 1:20:53.454
Then I'm sorry. I thought
you should know that I...

1:20:53.555 --> 1:20:55.255
You don't need to apologize
anymore. You've been

1:20:55.456 --> 1:20:58.225
apologizing your whole life
and it doesn't help.

1:21:00.928 --> 1:21:02.229
I don't need you
to fix my problems.

1:21:02.363 --> 1:21:04.431
I just want you
to take care of your own.

1:21:07.569 --> 1:21:08.435
Honey, we...

1:21:09.303 --> 1:21:11.038
- we gotta get dinner for Steph.
- Oh,

1:21:11.238 --> 1:21:13.340
of course. Yes.
Let me do that now.

1:21:17.779 --> 1:21:19.279
You guys drive safe, okay?

1:21:24.619 --> 1:21:25.553
Bye.

1:22:01.455 --> 1:22:02.256
Hey, that was a...

1:22:02.423 --> 1:22:03.892
that was a great thing
you did back there.

1:22:04.158 --> 1:22:06.026
It was the best thing, I think.

1:22:13.668 --> 1:22:15.035
What did Heather say?

1:22:16.738 --> 1:22:18.272
She wants me to sort my shit.

1:22:18.472 --> 1:22:20.307
Right.
That's good. Isn't it?

1:22:23.511 --> 1:22:25.078
It'll never go away.

1:22:28.148 --> 1:22:30.618
You know, what if... what if
we just stopped right now?

1:22:33.053 --> 1:22:35.723
- I can't make it stop.
- No, look, pull over,

1:22:35.956 --> 1:22:38.992
okay? Let's... Let's talk.
Let's take a break.

1:22:40.662 --> 1:22:43.096
Did you go over there so
you wouldn't have to cross over?

1:22:43.531 --> 1:22:45.667
Was that the entire point?
The... The trip?

1:22:45.900 --> 1:22:47.267
Skipping the flight,
all of this?

1:22:47.468 --> 1:22:50.003
I felt something,
some force,

1:22:50.270 --> 1:22:52.740
- drove me there.
- No. You drove you there.

1:22:53.106 --> 1:22:54.408
You can stop.

1:22:58.479 --> 1:22:59.747
I have to keep going.

1:23:51.900 --> 1:23:53.066
This is it.

1:24:01.074 --> 1:24:03.110
Too early
for protesting, I guess.

1:24:15.389 --> 1:24:16.658
You have your IDs?

1:24:16.858 --> 1:24:17.759
Yeah.

1:24:24.231 --> 1:24:27.367
Give him your ID.

1:24:40.180 --> 1:24:41.081
Thanks.

1:24:41.448 --> 1:24:43.350
You'll need your QR codes
at the check-in desks.

1:24:43.450 --> 1:24:44.752
Follow the road
to the parking lot.

1:25:19.821 --> 1:25:20.922
Welcome!

1:25:21.388 --> 1:25:23.190
May I have
your QR codes, please?

1:25:26.493 --> 1:25:27.427
Great.

1:25:28.663 --> 1:25:29.831
And you, sir?

1:25:30.932 --> 1:25:31.866
We can't have anyone

1:25:32.033 --> 1:25:33.868
on the premises
who's not a Participant.

1:25:36.571 --> 1:25:38.506
Thank you.

1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:39.974
All right.

1:25:40.374 --> 1:25:42.877
- Great to have you, Blossom...
- Rose.

1:25:43.578 --> 1:25:47.381
Yes, of course.
Blossom Rose and Theodore.

1:25:48.082 --> 1:25:49.617
You're a little early,
which is great.

1:25:49.851 --> 1:25:51.418
Dr. Stevensen is finishing up
a press conference

1:25:51.519 --> 1:25:53.021
- but, um, she'll be...
- I'm ready

1:25:53.153 --> 1:25:54.154
to do this now.

1:25:54.354 --> 1:25:55.455
Well, uh,

1:25:55.690 --> 1:25:57.357
Dr. Stevensen
flew in just for it,

1:25:57.457 --> 1:25:58.826
- but...
- I want to go now.

1:26:00.928 --> 1:26:01.896
Nurse Ala?

1:26:02.262 --> 1:26:05.332
Mm-hmm?
- Uh. Just one second.

1:26:06.134 --> 1:26:11.839
Um.

1:26:13.641 --> 1:26:16.209
Okay,
so let's see what we can do. Um,

1:26:16.511 --> 1:26:17.612
we'll start your paperwork

1:26:17.912 --> 1:26:20.982
and there's a video for you
to watch before your journey

1:26:21.415 --> 1:26:23.951
so we can get you started
there in a few minutes.

1:26:24.052 --> 1:26:25.452
- Does that sound good?
- Yeah.

1:26:26.154 --> 1:26:28.188
Okay. Follow me.

1:26:30.892 --> 1:26:32.192
And, uh, you, sir.

1:26:32.426 --> 1:26:34.762
Will you be coming back
for your appointment or...

1:26:43.571 --> 1:26:45.472
I thought this was
what you wanted.

1:26:46.607 --> 1:26:47.608
Not anymore.

1:26:50.377 --> 1:26:52.947
Okay, so
we are ready for you upstairs.

1:26:55.016 --> 1:26:58.553
Um, would you like
to watch the video together?

1:27:04.559 --> 1:27:05.960
<i>Congratulations!</i>

1:27:06.226 --> 1:27:07.394
<i>You are on your way to being</i>

1:27:07.528 --> 1:27:09.797
<i>an imperative part</i>
<i>of our Life Beyond study.</i>

1:27:10.430 --> 1:27:11.465
<i>You are ready to step</i>

1:27:11.699 --> 1:27:14.001
<i>into the next stage</i>
<i>of evolution with us.</i>

1:27:14.468 --> 1:27:17.939
<i>You are a pioneer</i>
<i>who will forever be remembered</i>

1:27:18.172 --> 1:27:19.907
<i>for your bravery</i>
<i>in building branches</i>

1:27:20.108 --> 1:27:22.510
<i>between this world</i>
<i>and the next.</i>

1:27:26.848 --> 1:27:27.849
Is that it?

1:27:32.419 --> 1:27:34.589
Okay, we are all set up

1:27:34.689 --> 1:27:36.389
to track and record
your journey.

1:27:36.657 --> 1:27:39.259
I'll be there the whole time
to help you transition smoothly.

1:27:39.493 --> 1:27:42.530
- Um, do you have any questions?
- Will it hurt?

1:27:42.864 --> 1:27:44.832
The IV can
be a little uncomfortable

1:27:44.966 --> 1:27:46.333
but we can numb the spot first.

1:27:46.534 --> 1:27:48.536
We begin with a sedative
to help you relax.

1:27:48.736 --> 1:27:50.470
It's a lot like
going under for surgery.

1:27:50.705 --> 1:27:52.206
Once you're in
a state of passing

1:27:52.439 --> 1:27:55.109
and we can see that you've
crossed on our tracking devices,

1:27:55.342 --> 1:27:57.578
then we terminate
your physical form.

1:27:58.345 --> 1:27:59.847
None of that will hurt.

1:28:02.315 --> 1:28:03.483
Are you ready?

1:28:06.554 --> 1:28:08.022
Yeah. Let's just do it. Yeah.

1:28:08.222 --> 1:28:09.957
Absolutely.
So you can follow me

1:28:10.191 --> 1:28:13.628
and we'll get you changed
and started in the Passing Room.

1:28:14.327 --> 1:28:16.463
Mm-hmm.

1:28:21.235 --> 1:28:23.738
Sir, do you want to step
into the waiting room?

1:28:24.005 --> 1:28:25.072
Can I stay?

1:28:27.041 --> 1:28:28.709
It is important
that you have a calm

1:28:28.910 --> 1:28:31.846
- and positive experience...
- He can stay.

1:28:32.547 --> 1:28:35.683
Okay. Yeah. It's good.
Come on in.

1:28:44.125 --> 1:28:45.293
Okay.

1:28:45.492 --> 1:28:47.427
Can I push this up? Yeah?

1:28:49.130 --> 1:28:52.133
All right. And let me have you
make a few fist pumps.

1:28:52.332 --> 1:28:56.804
Pump. Four,
three, two, one. Good.

1:28:57.805 --> 1:28:59.807
Yeah.

1:29:06.981 --> 1:29:07.849
Okay.

1:29:12.987 --> 1:29:13.855
Okay.

1:29:15.189 --> 1:29:17.024
Okay. Here comes the needle.

1:29:19.093 --> 1:29:20.761
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1:29:21.229 --> 1:29:23.496
In three, two, one.

1:29:24.464 --> 1:29:25.766
Is that okay?

1:29:43.284 --> 1:29:44.652
Okay.
That feel comfortable?

1:29:44.752 --> 1:29:45.653
Yes.

1:29:49.757 --> 1:29:50.658
All right.

1:29:52.093 --> 1:29:53.393
Shall we?

1:30:00.768 --> 1:30:01.669
Okay.

1:30:04.639 --> 1:30:06.240
- No. Just one...
- Sir!

1:30:06.340 --> 1:30:07.541
- No. Sir. Sir.
- Just give me...

1:30:07.675 --> 1:30:09.409
Hey, hey, hey.
Just give me one more day.

1:30:09.510 --> 1:30:11.178
- Sir.
- Teddy, what does it matter?

1:30:11.312 --> 1:30:12.346
One hour.
Just give me that.

1:30:12.580 --> 1:30:13.581
What if I can't?

1:30:13.814 --> 1:30:15.883
Ten... Ten minutes
to think about how you can.

1:30:16.083 --> 1:30:16.884
I don't deserve it.

1:30:17.018 --> 1:30:19.620
Five minutes
to you realize that you do.

1:30:21.289 --> 1:30:22.422
No, one minute.

1:30:22.790 --> 1:30:25.760
One minute to think
about what you did yesterday.

1:30:26.794 --> 1:30:28.396
Not... Not what happened
in the past,

1:30:28.663 --> 1:30:30.097
not what happened
when you were younger...

1:30:30.831 --> 1:30:32.199
and not the things
you can't control

1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:33.466
or the mistakes you made.

1:30:33.668 --> 1:30:36.370
Please. Just...
...one minute.

1:30:36.737 --> 1:30:39.707
Just give me one more minute.

1:30:41.309 --> 1:30:42.576
Wait.

1:30:47.480 --> 1:30:48.816
Rose.

1:31:39.834 --> 1:31:41.902
Mom?

1:31:43.938 --> 1:31:45.506
I'm sorry.

1:31:46.707 --> 1:31:50.111
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1:31:50.344 --> 1:31:54.682
I tried. I tried hard.
I couldn't. I... I...

1:32:00.488 --> 1:32:01.622
No.

1:34:17.526 --> 1:34:19.260
<i>Rose!</i>

1:34:20.562 --> 1:34:21.962
<i>She'll never know.</i>

1:34:40.314 --> 1:34:42.716
<i>She will just disappear.</i>

1:35:23.592 --> 1:35:26.827
She's dead.

1:35:28.162 --> 1:35:29.363
Rose, it's Mom.

1:35:31.432 --> 1:35:33.000
She's dead.

1:35:33.801 --> 1:35:35.169
Where are you?

1:35:35.402 --> 1:35:37.004
Where are you?

1:35:42.276 --> 1:35:44.411
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

1:35:45.112 --> 1:35:46.146
I'm here.

1:35:47.248 --> 1:35:49.316
Heather. I'm here.

1:35:50.417 --> 1:35:52.152
Heather, I'm here.

1:35:52.753 --> 1:35:55.956
- I'm here, Heather! I'm here.
- God damn it, Rose!

1:36:13.307 --> 1:36:14.475
<i>I'm here.</i>

1:37:24.912 --> 1:37:27.181
<i>You can do it. Come on.</i>

1:37:37.124 --> 1:37:43.330
Just... Just
give me one minute, please.

1:38:03.117 --> 1:38:04.184
Rose?

1:38:08.489 --> 1:38:10.759
Wait.

1:38:14.027 --> 1:38:17.398
- Hey.
- I can start with one minute.

1:39:04.044 --> 1:39:05.412
So, what was it like?

1:39:07.615 --> 1:39:10.984
It was like almost dying.

1:39:15.489 --> 1:39:18.693
I don't know.
It was all of me all at once.

1:39:19.894 --> 1:39:21.195
And it was okay.

1:39:24.097 --> 1:39:25.499
I knew I wanted...

1:39:28.903 --> 1:39:30.204
to keep trying.

1:39:55.864 --> 1:39:58.365
You drive?

1:40:00.902 --> 1:40:01.836
- Seriously?
- Yeah, you...

1:40:02.069 --> 1:40:04.137
- You heard me right.
- Wow.

1:40:08.843 --> 1:40:12.145
You want to die twice?

1:45:28.196 --> 1:45:29.297
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1:45:29.630 --> 1:45:31.331
<i>The car's on my credit card.</i>

1:45:31.866 --> 1:45:33.301
<i>Thank God it's not on mine.</i>

1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:35.368
<i>So,</i>
<i>we need to drop this off, too.</i>

1:45:36.070 --> 1:45:37.738
<i>No, let's just take it.</i>

1:45:38.005 --> 1:45:40.274
<i>I need to go get my dog.</i>

1:45:40.541 --> 1:45:42.475
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- What?</i>
