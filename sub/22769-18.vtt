The Ring of Wearing

00:08.500 --> 00:11.670
"Over my dead phalanges,
Dr. Glove!"

00:11.670 --> 00:14.620
Mini-Max:
Is Dr. Glove also
just a hand?

00:14.620 --> 00:16.380
You see, Fist is the left,
Glove is the right.

Frederick?

00:18.580 --> 00:19.920
Are you dressed for dinner?

00:19.920 --> 00:21.710
We have a very important

00:21.710 --> 00:24.330
(sing-song)
Orso Knox!

00:24.330 --> 00:25.960
(groans)
Yeah, Mom!

00:25.960 --> 00:28.330
Just pressing my cummerbund.

00:28.330 --> 00:29.960
What is a cummerbund?

00:29.960 --> 00:31.670
Literally, no one knows.

00:31.670 --> 00:33.500
"Then it has come to this.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.920
Your doom will fit you
like a glove."

I'm Fred.
You're a big scary monster.

01:13.620 --> 01:16.290
Never mind! Different!
Very different!

I see that now!
I was mistaken!

do tell him
dinner is canceled.

02:11.170 --> 02:14.040
Yes, there was
a monster attack.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.040
I know, I know.
Mortifying.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.210
Mini-Max has sustained
significant damage.

-(beeping)
-Little bud, it's gonna
be Mini-Maximum okay.

02:22.790 --> 02:24.460
-So, what'd it look like?
-Okay.

02:24.460 --> 02:26.580
So imagine if you put
a whale and a dinosaur

02:26.580 --> 02:28.380
and some hair into a blender

02:28.380 --> 02:30.540
then poured that into
a human-shaped ice tray.

02:30.540 --> 02:32.710
And froze it and then
let it thaw just a little.

02:32.710 --> 02:34.210
Wow, really?

02:34.210 --> 02:37.830
Mini-Max:
I can provide

02:37.830 --> 02:39.500
(beeping)

02:39.500 --> 02:42.420
Go Go:
Huh. That actually looks
like Fred's description.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.580
Baymax?

02:45.580 --> 02:48.540
I will swab
for DNA traces.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.500
He must've been an
old enemy of my dad's.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.170
He said,
"What's past is prologue."

02:53.170 --> 02:56.580
Which sure sounds like
something a monster
out for revenge would say.

02:56.580 --> 02:58.670
Monster? Seriously?

02:58.670 --> 03:00.790
-(Baymax beeping)
-And he ate his portrait.

03:00.790 --> 03:04.040
The DNA does not match
any known species.

03:04.040 --> 03:07.290
Real life monster.

03:07.290 --> 03:09.880
Coolest dad ever!

03:12.620 --> 03:14.670
Wow. Your dad had
a lot of enemies.

03:14.670 --> 03:18.000
(groans)
But I can't figure out which
one of my dad's old nemesis--

03:18.000 --> 03:19.380
Nemeses?

03:19.380 --> 03:20.790
Nemecinnamonsinnamons?

03:20.790 --> 03:22.040
Nemesis?

03:22.040 --> 03:23.670
What is-- how do you do that?

03:23.670 --> 03:25.250
Nemisynonym?
Necinnamon?

03:25.250 --> 03:27.460
Oh! This guy's
called "The Monster"!

03:27.460 --> 03:29.750
No, he was more
of a social monster.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.620
Talked during movies,
clipped his toenails
on public transportation.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.830
-Gross stuff like that.
-Ew.

03:34.830 --> 03:38.250
Uh, guys? We just saw
Granville heading this way.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.580
-And she looks--
-Very un-Granville.

03:40.580 --> 03:41.620
Meaning?

03:43.670 --> 03:45.420
Oh.

03:45.420 --> 03:46.790
Straighten up the lab.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.580
There's a visitor coming!

03:48.580 --> 03:49.920
(chuckling)

03:49.920 --> 03:51.960
You also might want
to hide him somewhere!

03:51.960 --> 03:53.880
Nemeseses?

03:53.880 --> 03:55.330
So, who's the visitor?

03:55.330 --> 03:56.460
Liv Amara.

03:57.710 --> 03:59.380
Uh? Uh?

04:00.380 --> 04:02.420
-Liv Amara!
-Go Go: Wait.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.420
"Liv Amara" Liv Amara?

04:04.420 --> 04:05.750
Founder of Sycorax?

04:05.750 --> 04:06.620
Precisely!

04:06.620 --> 04:09.210
Only, like, one of the words
Go Go just said

04:09.210 --> 04:10.580
meant anything to me.

04:10.580 --> 04:13.620
Liv Amara is 23 and runs
her own bio-tech company.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.830
In other words,
totally hardcore.

04:16.830 --> 04:18.920
"Totally hardcore"
indeed.

04:18.920 --> 04:23.620
And she's donated funds for
SFIT's new bio-tech building.

04:23.620 --> 04:27.120
There's going to be
a dedication ceremony
later this week.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.880
Oh! So that's what the
big tent outside is for.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.380
(groans)

04:32.380 --> 04:34.790
Aw, you thought the circus
was coming, didn't you?

04:34.790 --> 04:35.960
Yeah.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.750
Liv Amara has heard
about Baymax,

04:37.750 --> 04:39.500
and she'd like
to meet him,

04:39.500 --> 04:40.710
and you.

04:40.710 --> 04:43.420
Ooh! Goals!

04:43.420 --> 04:45.540
-(helicopter blades whirring)
-There she is now!

04:45.540 --> 04:47.540
-Look intelligent.
-(door opens)

04:49.750 --> 04:51.580
I saw Liv Amara's
helicopter land,

04:51.580 --> 04:52.670
and I had to come
and meet her!

04:52.670 --> 04:54.330
She is my hero!
I love her!
Is she here?

04:54.330 --> 04:55.920
Baymax:
You should breathe now.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.000
Karmi, heh,
she's here to see me.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.960
-Then she'll be very
pleasantly surprised by me.
-(door opens)

05:00.960 --> 05:04.170
Students,
meet Ms. Amara!

05:04.170 --> 05:05.790
Come on, Grace.
You can call me Liv.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.000
-Grace?
-Grace?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.420
Liv, this is Hiro Hamada.

05:09.420 --> 05:11.460
Which must make
this little guy Baymax!

05:12.460 --> 05:14.790
I am relatively large
in stature.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.620
So, tell me about him.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.790
Uh, hyper-spectral cameras.

05:21.790 --> 05:22.790
Carbon-fiber skeleton.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.670
I can see that!
I mean, what lead you
to create him?

05:25.670 --> 05:27.830
Oh, I-- I actually didn't.

05:27.830 --> 05:30.380
-My brother did.
-Oh. Well, great to meet you.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.580
But-- but the upgrades
are all me!

05:32.580 --> 05:34.210
-And I've invented--
-Excuse me, Ms. Amara?

05:34.210 --> 05:36.330
I'm Karmi.
Let me introduce to you

05:36.330 --> 05:38.460
the extradermal
nano-receptor.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.790
Tiny, painless.
No needles.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.620
An iontophoretic
delivery system?

05:42.620 --> 05:45.540
-And it works?
-Yep! I've run
three rounds of trials.

05:45.540 --> 05:47.420
The last trial was
really promising.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.420
Karmi, this is incredible.

05:49.420 --> 05:50.880
Hey, how would you
like to come with us

05:50.880 --> 05:52.500
to see the new
bio-tech building?

05:52.500 --> 05:54.250
(Hiro gasps)

05:54.250 --> 05:57.000
Is artemisinic acid
the world's most effective
anti-malarial compound?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.380
(Karmi and Liv laugh)

05:59.750 --> 06:01.210
(growls)

06:01.210 --> 06:02.620
Professor Granville, you said
she was here to see me!

06:02.620 --> 06:04.540
She was, Mr. Hamada,

06:04.540 --> 06:07.040
but Karmi wowed her.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.580
Karmi basically
invented a sticker.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.830
Green isn't a good color
on you, Mr. Hamada.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.830
Baymax:
Hiro is not wearing green.

06:14.830 --> 06:16.880
She means
he's jealous of Karmi.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.750

-Yes!

06:53.790 --> 06:55.500

Yes, Mr. Krei?

06:55.500 --> 06:59.460
Uh, call Big Hero 6. Now!

07:00.960 --> 07:04.500
This thing of darkness

07:04.500 --> 07:07.460
I acknowledge mine!

07:07.460 --> 07:08.960
-(monster roars)
-(Krei screams)

07:08.960 --> 07:11.000
Krei:
I don't know
what that means!

07:12.580 --> 07:14.920
This creature
just burst in here,

07:14.920 --> 07:15.960
said something weird
and left!

07:15.960 --> 07:18.040
I was barely able
to fight it off!

07:18.040 --> 07:19.920
Ooh! This tea is hot!

07:19.920 --> 07:22.330
Oh, he hid behind
a file cabinet until it left.

07:22.330 --> 07:24.380
-(Krei growls)
-Bravely.

07:27.830 --> 07:29.250
What did it look like?

07:29.250 --> 07:31.120
It was like
if you put a whale

07:31.120 --> 07:32.920
and a dinosaur and some
hair into a blender,

07:32.920 --> 07:34.790
then poured that into
a human-shaped ice tray,

07:34.790 --> 07:36.710
and froze it
and let it thaw a little.

07:36.710 --> 07:38.040
Told ya! That's the monster!

07:38.040 --> 07:40.170
What weird thing
did it say?

07:40.170 --> 07:43.580
"This thing of darkness
I acknowledge mine."

07:43.580 --> 07:44.960
I don't know.
Something like that.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.250
There was a lot
of grunts in there!

07:46.250 --> 07:47.880
Why is there--? (sniffs)

07:47.880 --> 07:49.620
What smells like
shrimp scampi?

07:49.620 --> 07:51.290
(sniffing)

07:51.290 --> 07:53.210
Oh, I'm a monster hunter now.

07:53.210 --> 07:54.250
So, I came prepared!

07:54.250 --> 07:57.500
Freddie, you know garlic
is for vampires, right?

07:58.790 --> 08:00.500
Yes.

08:01.790 --> 08:03.750
(gagging)
This is just a-- a snack.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.040
(Fred gags)

08:05.040 --> 08:07.170
Go back a sec.
What were you doing
when this freak attacked?

08:07.170 --> 08:08.960
Nothing!

08:08.960 --> 08:09.830
I was finally
supposed to be

08:09.830 --> 08:11.380
meeting with an investor,
Orso Knox.

08:11.380 --> 08:12.580
Orso Knox?

08:12.580 --> 08:14.920
One of the richest men
in San Fransokyo.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.210
-Trust fund baby.
-Fred: Wait, Orso Knox?

08:17.210 --> 08:18.880
That's the guy
my mom had to cancel on

08:18.880 --> 08:19.960
the night the monster
attacked!

08:19.960 --> 08:21.460
I'd been courting him
for years,

08:21.460 --> 08:23.960
and then suddenly,
Liv Amara shows up,

08:23.960 --> 08:25.920
and he wants to invest with
her impressive new company,

08:25.920 --> 08:27.670
and her shiny, shiny hair!

08:27.670 --> 08:28.790
(growls)

08:28.790 --> 08:30.330
He's a little jealous.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.380
What?! My hair shines.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.830
♪ ♪

08:34.830 --> 08:36.710
(sizzling)

08:40.330 --> 08:42.540
(squeaking)

08:48.920 --> 08:50.960
This is not
a robotics project.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.120
No, it's bio-tech.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.540
I have to come up
with something better

08:53.540 --> 08:55.830
than Karmi's dermal
nano sticker thing.

08:55.830 --> 08:58.960
And I think
this will do the trick.

08:58.960 --> 09:02.000
Let's say you only get
to study one subject forever.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.380
-What do you pick?
-Karmi: Uh, organic chemistry!

09:04.380 --> 09:06.080
Wait, no!
Pathogenic bacteria!

09:06.080 --> 09:07.420
Ah! Same!

09:07.420 --> 09:09.170
-(both laughing)
-(Hiro clears throat)

09:09.170 --> 09:10.880
Hey, uh, Ms. Amara.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.330
I wanted to show you something
I've been working on.

09:13.330 --> 09:16.120
Now? I'm kind of eating.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.750
But, okay.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.000
(sarcastically)
Oh, joy!

09:19.000 --> 09:22.290
This is a temperature
gradient device!

09:22.290 --> 09:23.420
May I?

09:23.420 --> 09:25.040
(beeps)

09:25.040 --> 09:28.460
As you can see,
it easily converts
physical changes in heat

09:28.460 --> 09:31.830
to an easy to understand
numerical value.

09:31.830 --> 09:34.000
(laughs)
And it has plenty of
practical applications

09:34.000 --> 09:35.380
for medical and
commercial use.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.960
(blows air)

09:36.960 --> 09:39.080
So, it's a thermometer?

09:39.080 --> 09:41.080
Huh? Hmm?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.420
A really big thermometer.

09:43.420 --> 09:45.920
It's a temperature gradient--

09:45.920 --> 09:47.330
Yeah, no, it's a thermometer.

09:47.330 --> 09:48.960
(machine beeps slowly)

09:48.960 --> 09:51.000
(wheels squeaking)

09:52.920 --> 09:54.880
♪ ♪

09:54.880 --> 09:56.000
Honey Lemon:
Cheer up, Hiro!

09:56.000 --> 09:58.040
At least you made
a really cool thermometer.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.210
(groans)
I want to melt
into the floor!

10:00.210 --> 10:02.540
Baymax:
That is a physical
impossibility.

10:02.540 --> 10:05.000
How could I be
so stupid? (sniffs)

10:05.000 --> 10:06.210
And what's that smell?

10:07.960 --> 10:09.750
Oh! I'm being rude.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.670
You want some?
I definitely like it,

10:11.670 --> 10:12.880
and this is not
just pretending

10:12.880 --> 10:14.000
that I didn't know
what garlic was for.

10:15.420 --> 10:17.750
Well, maybe
Granville was right.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.040
Liv is more interested
in Karmi's work than yours,

10:20.040 --> 10:21.170
and that's making you feel--

10:21.170 --> 10:23.210
If you're gonna say
"jealous," no!

10:23.210 --> 10:25.080
I'm definitely not jealous!

10:25.080 --> 10:26.670
There's nothing to be
jealous of!

10:26.670 --> 10:28.620
I was going
to say "insecure,"

10:28.620 --> 10:31.040
but now it's sounding
like you are jealous.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.460
Guys, shouldn't we
be trying to track down
his monster right now?

10:33.460 --> 10:36.000
Yes, we're going to see
Orso Knox this afternoon

10:36.000 --> 10:36.920
to see if there's
some connection

10:36.920 --> 10:37.920
with the monster.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.620
You want a mint
or some gum?

10:41.620 --> 10:42.830
No. Why?

10:42.830 --> 10:44.670
(gagging)

10:44.670 --> 10:46.960
Hiro:
Mr. Knox?

10:46.960 --> 10:48.790
Fred:
Weird.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.580
Honey Lemon:
Mr. Knox?

10:51.580 --> 10:54.080
The door was open.
May we come in?

11:00.880 --> 11:02.330
Whoa. This office--

11:02.330 --> 11:04.250
Is Wasabi's worst nightmare!

11:06.620 --> 11:08.040
(glass shatters)

11:11.750 --> 11:13.920
He's not supposed
to be out today.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.210
Hiro:
"Office hours."

11:15.210 --> 11:16.920
Huh. Baymax?

11:16.920 --> 11:18.000
Can you find Knox?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
-(beeping)
-Scanning biometric data.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.290
(beeping continues)

11:26.210 --> 11:29.170
(roaring)

11:29.170 --> 11:30.380
See? I told you!

11:30.380 --> 11:31.710
He looked like
if you put a whale

11:31.710 --> 11:34.290
and a dinosaur and some
hair into a blender-- aah!

11:34.290 --> 11:35.790
(roars)

11:35.790 --> 11:37.000
(Fred groans)

11:39.210 --> 11:40.880
-(roars)
-(all exclaim)

11:42.540 --> 11:43.710
(grunts)

11:45.380 --> 11:46.880
(shouts)

11:46.880 --> 11:49.000
-(roaring)
-Fred: I've got this!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.210
Away with thee, monster!

11:51.210 --> 11:52.460
(roars)

11:52.460 --> 11:54.040
What? (screams)

11:54.040 --> 11:56.580
-(Fred screaming)
-(glass shattering)

11:56.580 --> 11:58.000
Fred (groaning):
Again?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.290
(monster snarling)

12:01.670 --> 12:04.210
-Knox's schedule!
-(snarling)

12:05.960 --> 12:07.040
(Hiro exclaims)

12:08.710 --> 12:10.880
-Hiro!
-(Hiro grunting)

12:10.880 --> 12:15.120
All the devils are here.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.670
Baymax! Overdrive mode!

12:16.670 --> 12:18.460
Overdrive mode: engaged.

12:18.460 --> 12:19.670
(air hissing)

12:23.750 --> 12:25.330
(metallic clanking)

12:29.960 --> 12:32.000
Overdrive mode.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.500
(energy charging)

12:38.040 --> 12:39.210
(grunts)

12:43.460 --> 12:44.830
(metallic clanking)

12:44.830 --> 12:47.330
(slurring)
I scared the blender whale!

12:47.330 --> 12:49.080
Oh, thanks, Baymax.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.790
No problem, pal.

12:51.790 --> 12:54.000
-(thud)
-(Fred groans)

12:54.000 --> 12:56.580
Uh, so the garlic
isn't as effective

12:56.580 --> 12:58.670
as one would've hoped.

12:58.670 --> 13:01.170
(air blowing)

13:01.170 --> 13:03.580
"All the devils are here."

13:03.580 --> 13:06.290
-What?
-He's so dramatic!

13:06.290 --> 13:08.120
It's like,
"Dude, start a blog."

13:08.120 --> 13:10.830
-(beeps)
-Honey Lemon:
"All the devils are here."

13:10.830 --> 13:13.170
"All the devils are here"!
The Tempest!

13:13.170 --> 13:15.170
-The what?
-The Shakespeare play.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.620
"All the devils are here."

13:16.620 --> 13:18.540
"This thing of darkness
I acknowledge mine."

13:18.540 --> 13:20.040
"What's past is prologue."

13:20.040 --> 13:21.750
They're quotes from
The Tempest!

13:21.750 --> 13:27.250
All the devils are here.

13:27.250 --> 13:30.540
This thing of darkness

13:30.540 --> 13:33.380
I acknowledge mine!

13:33.380 --> 13:36.830
What's past is prologue.

13:36.830 --> 13:40.330
So, the monster's
a Shakespeare fan?

13:40.330 --> 13:43.330
No, but Orso Knox was.
I think...

13:43.330 --> 13:45.500
Baymax/Honey Lemon:
The monster is Orso Knox!

13:45.500 --> 13:47.750
You know, now one of you
owes the other a soda.

13:47.750 --> 13:51.210
Baymax:
I mapped the iris on
the photo of Orso Knox.

13:51.210 --> 13:53.330
It matched with the monster.

13:53.330 --> 13:56.120
What happened to him?
Some kind of genetic mutation?

13:56.120 --> 13:57.500
Wait a minute.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.460
Fred's house, Krei's office.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.620
Knox has been keeping
his appointments!

14:02.620 --> 14:04.880
Which means the next place
he's going is...

14:04.880 --> 14:06.880
-Hiro/Honey Lemon: SFIT.
-S.F.I.T.

14:08.210 --> 14:09.540
I mean, SFIT.

14:12.330 --> 14:14.790
This play has three
of my top nine fears.

14:14.790 --> 14:18.790
Shipwrecks, rainstorms
and... (shudders)

14:18.790 --> 14:19.920
puns.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.120
Lunatic mutant billionaire
tops those.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.620
I have an idea
to level the playing field.

14:23.620 --> 14:25.620
And it can be executed now.

14:25.620 --> 14:28.210
(whirring)

14:28.210 --> 14:29.420
(squeals happily)

14:29.420 --> 14:31.290
Not in some magical,
distant future,

14:31.290 --> 14:33.330
like the ideas of some
bio-tech major we all know,

14:33.330 --> 14:34.500
whose name rhymes
with "Zarmi."

14:34.500 --> 14:36.290
Are you talking about Jarmi?

14:36.290 --> 14:39.170
'Cause I agree.
His ideas are crazy.

14:40.210 --> 14:42.120
I like Jarmi. Snappy dresser.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.750
It is sweet! Whoo!

14:49.750 --> 14:51.750
This ultra armor's
a little heavy,

14:51.750 --> 14:53.000
and a lot awesome!

14:53.000 --> 14:54.960
Go Go:
I like it.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.830
Ooh.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.330
Hiro:
Titanium reinforced to withstand
more of a beating.

15:01.540 --> 15:03.330
Oh. Great.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.330
It's going to be
super helpful, Hiro!

15:05.330 --> 15:07.420
Yeah. Ultra Armor, a win.

15:07.420 --> 15:11.000
Hmm, how does Karmi have
negative accomplishments?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Because everything she does
is the worst.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.750
Hiro, are you ever jealous

15:15.750 --> 15:18.290
of how awesomely
organized I am?

15:18.290 --> 15:20.420
What? Uh, no, why?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.670
Or how fast I am?

15:21.670 --> 15:23.040
Or how positive I am?

15:23.040 --> 15:24.960
Or how Fred I am?

15:24.960 --> 15:27.170
No. You guys are who you are.

15:27.170 --> 15:28.290
Exactly.

15:28.290 --> 15:30.460
And Karmi is
a bio-tech genius.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.880
That's who she is.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.960
She's special in ways
that you're not,

15:33.960 --> 15:36.420
and you're special in ways
that she's not.

15:36.420 --> 15:38.080
The world is cool like that.

15:38.080 --> 15:41.380
Baymax:
Reminder-- it is time to leave
for the dedication gala.

15:41.380 --> 15:43.670
We've got a socialite turned
Shakespeare monster to catch!

15:43.670 --> 15:45.790
-I'll get the garlic.
-All: No!

15:45.790 --> 15:47.710
-(indistinct chatter)
-(light music playing)

15:51.170 --> 15:53.960
Not fair! You guys
get all that
free gala food!

15:53.960 --> 15:55.250
We're just trying
to cover our bases

15:55.250 --> 15:56.620
until Knox shows up.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.290
We'll bring you a crab cake.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.000
Fred (on comm):
Yes!

16:02.210 --> 16:06.040
Wow! This is some serious
sucking up to Liv Amara.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.330
(camera clicks)

16:07.330 --> 16:10.500
Ooh! Go Go! Selfies
with the ice sculptures!

16:10.500 --> 16:11.750
Fred (on comm):
Are there egg rolls?

16:11.750 --> 16:13.290
Just tell me if
there are egg rolls!

16:13.290 --> 16:15.460
Copy. I've got a visual
on the egg rolls.

16:19.330 --> 16:20.620
Mr. Krei?

16:20.620 --> 16:22.500
Sure, she's brilliant
and beautiful and generous,

16:22.500 --> 16:25.250
but what does she have
that I don't?

16:25.250 --> 16:27.710
Uh, you want me
to answer that?

16:27.710 --> 16:30.040
Another gala.
Another honorary degree!

16:30.040 --> 16:34.330
Oh, look at that!
It's another benefit concert
for Liv Amara!

16:34.330 --> 16:37.750
Well, uh, she is special
in ways that you are not.

16:37.750 --> 16:41.290
And you are special
in ways that she's not.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.960
Uh, no. She's the worst.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.330
(exclaims)

16:48.420 --> 16:50.880
I'm just gonna go.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.500
Status report.

16:52.500 --> 16:57.040
There is no sign of
the Orso Knox monster.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.500
Maybe he likes being
fashionably late?

16:59.500 --> 17:01.540
(indistinct chatter)

17:01.540 --> 17:03.420
Granville:
If I may have your attention.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.380
(chuckles)
Attention, please.

17:05.380 --> 17:06.790
(chatter continues)

17:06.790 --> 17:09.330
-Attention!
-(feedback)

17:10.460 --> 17:12.250
Thank you, thank you.

17:12.250 --> 17:16.000
There are few innovators
who have made their mark

17:16.000 --> 17:19.500
as quickly and completely
as Liv Amara.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.540
(coughs)
Over-rated.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.080
-(monster roaring)
-(Wasabi gasps)

17:23.080 --> 17:24.170
Fred:
Do you hear that?

17:27.420 --> 17:28.920
And do you see that?!

17:28.920 --> 17:31.540
-Yep, and I'm ready.
-Whoa!

17:31.540 --> 17:33.420
Wasabi, you're,
like, not afraid?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.500
I'm in my good
denial place, Fred.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.790
Don't ruin this.

17:36.790 --> 17:39.460
So it is my honor
to introduce the namesake

17:39.460 --> 17:42.040
of the new
Amara Bio-tech Center.

17:42.040 --> 17:46.210
-Miss Liv Amara!
-(applause)

17:47.460 --> 17:49.000
Thank you, Grace.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.540
You know, the other day,
I was lucky enough

17:51.540 --> 17:53.620
to meet a current
bio-tech student.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.380
Karmi reminded me why

17:55.380 --> 17:57.540
-I wanted to help
build this facility.
-(Hiro gasps, groans)

17:57.540 --> 17:59.080
Game time!

17:59.080 --> 18:02.420
(snarling)

18:02.420 --> 18:04.580
All:
Oh, no.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.380
"Oh, no" what?

18:06.380 --> 18:08.580
Nothing much.
Just Orso Knox!

18:08.580 --> 18:11.540
(snarling)

18:11.540 --> 18:13.380
Hold him off!

18:13.380 --> 18:15.000
(energy charges)

18:18.580 --> 18:20.670
(roars)

18:20.670 --> 18:21.960
Hey, it worked!

18:21.960 --> 18:23.380
Hiro, this armor is--

18:23.380 --> 18:25.500
Whoa!

18:25.500 --> 18:26.920
-(monster growling)
-(Wasabi whimpers)

18:28.750 --> 18:30.620
Fred:
This one's for Mini-Max!

18:30.620 --> 18:32.580
(roaring)

18:32.580 --> 18:34.620
Let's clear out the tent!

18:34.620 --> 18:36.670
And a new generation...

18:36.670 --> 18:38.250
-Excuse me?
-is ready.

18:38.250 --> 18:41.290
-Excuse me, everyone.
-Ready to lead our industry
into the future.

18:41.290 --> 18:42.500
(whistles loudly)
Hey!

18:43.620 --> 18:45.580
Back exits, everyone!

18:45.580 --> 18:47.120
-Now!
-Please.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.620
(monster roaring)

18:49.620 --> 18:52.620
-(people screaming)
-(objects clattering)

18:52.620 --> 18:54.170
-What's going on?
-Long story.

18:54.170 --> 18:56.170
-Big fan.
-Is Captain Cutie here?

18:56.170 --> 18:58.420
Is Captain Cutie here?!

18:58.420 --> 19:00.460
(roaring)

19:03.040 --> 19:04.880
Honey Lemon? All clear?

19:04.880 --> 19:06.000
Honey Lemon (on comm):
All clear!

19:06.000 --> 19:08.670
(roars)

19:08.670 --> 19:11.290
-Wasabi, get up.
-Where are we going?

19:11.290 --> 19:12.580
I have an idea.

19:12.580 --> 19:14.750
(roars)

19:18.540 --> 19:20.540
Inside that monster,
there's a person.

19:20.540 --> 19:22.580
Mr. Knox,
we wanna help you.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.460
Yeah. Mostly monster.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.670
Blade!

19:33.670 --> 19:35.540
(crackling)

19:41.330 --> 19:42.420

20:12.380 --> 20:13.540
Hiro:
No worries, everyone.

20:13.540 --> 20:16.000
-We've got this
situation under--

(rapid beeping)

20:36.920 --> 20:39.290
Extradermal nano-receptor!

20:39.290 --> 20:40.670
I administered a sedative.

20:40.670 --> 20:42.670
(monster growling)

20:43.670 --> 20:45.210
(rapid beeping)

20:45.210 --> 20:48.330
(laughs nervously)
Thought maybe you could
use the help.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.460
(deep voice)
Uh... thanks!

20:51.460 --> 20:54.250
See? This is exactly
the kind of thinking

20:54.250 --> 20:55.620
that's getting
your project funded.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.500
(normal voice)
Funded?

20:57.500 --> 20:59.120
(deep voice)
I mean, uh, ahem...

20:59.120 --> 21:00.710
Good for you.
(chuckles)

21:00.710 --> 21:02.750
Props on the armor,
Big Hero 6.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.380
Excellent mech work.

21:04.380 --> 21:05.960
Not my area of expertise,

21:05.960 --> 21:07.580
but I'm impressed.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.920
Check out the titanium
back spikes, huh?

21:09.920 --> 21:13.000
-Fred: Yeah!
-So, what do we do
about Sleeping Ugly, here?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.080
Hmm, that's kind of harsh.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.460
There's a secure
genetics lab back
at Sycorax.

21:17.460 --> 21:19.420
If anybody can help him,
my team can.

21:19.420 --> 21:21.750
Baymax:
I will help you transport
him to the lab.

21:21.750 --> 21:24.920
You know, Karmi, you did
a super job out there.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.460
I love you too,
Captain Cutie.

21:26.460 --> 21:27.580
-What?!
-What?

21:27.580 --> 21:29.000
(quickly)
I gotta go!

21:31.830 --> 21:33.040
Oh.
