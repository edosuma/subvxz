WEBVTT

00:00.030 --> 00:02.599
I want to do
something original. Unique!

00:02.600 --> 00:04.735
You could paint
your perfect painting, Pablo.

00:04.736 --> 00:07.771
These paintings, they
were the best work I've ever done.

00:07.772 --> 00:10.407
I've had my work destroyed before.

00:10.408 --> 00:13.943
And the Nazis have labeled
every bit of it as degenerate.

00:13.945 --> 00:16.146
It is extraordinary, Pablo.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.848
It's a gift, Uncle.

00:17.849 --> 00:19.750
To thank you for everything
you've done for me.

00:19.751 --> 00:21.280
I made to vow to God that if he let

00:21.281 --> 00:23.144
Conchita live I would
give up painting.

00:24.189 --> 00:26.123
God knew I could
never keep my promise.

00:26.124 --> 00:29.326
So, he punished me. He took her.

00:30.295 --> 00:31.929
The roses are exquisite, Hervé.

00:31.930 --> 00:33.463
Thank you, Monsieur.

00:33.464 --> 00:35.999
There are thorns. Be careful.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.201
Never.

00:37.202 --> 00:38.802
Who is this woman, Pablo?

00:38.803 --> 00:40.637
I am Dora Maar. And
you must be Marie-Thérèse.

00:42.841 --> 00:44.942
I will never be bored by you.

00:45.977 --> 00:48.178
My name is Carles Casagemas.

00:48.179 --> 00:50.747
What is yours?

00:50.915 --> 00:52.316
Picasso.

00:52.317 --> 00:53.884
Picasso and I, we are the future.

00:53.885 --> 00:55.185
I don't understand you, Francoise.

00:55.186 --> 00:56.820
I want to be a painter.

00:56.821 --> 00:58.121
You will become a lawyer.

00:58.122 --> 00:59.489
Do I make myself clear?

00:59.490 --> 01:01.550
Franco and his
fanatics are winning the war.

01:02.527 --> 01:05.295
Franco has Hitler and the
Nazis on his side, Pablo.

01:05.830 --> 01:07.865
We need you on ours.

01:07.866 --> 01:08.978
I know you didn't want to make

01:08.979 --> 01:10.868
a painting for the Spanish Pavilion,

01:10.869 --> 01:12.569
but now you must.

01:12.570 --> 01:15.405
I am going to need a very big canvas.

01:16.507 --> 01:18.275
I'm getting my family to safety.

01:18.276 --> 01:20.644
Guernica made the Nazis very angry.

01:21.012 --> 01:23.947
You have children. Women you love.

01:23.948 --> 01:26.350
Some things are more
important than art.

01:26.351 --> 01:27.818
Not to me.

02:46.364 --> 02:47.264
Francoise?

02:47.265 --> 02:48.203
Momma?

02:48.204 --> 02:49.633
The Germans have crossed the border.

02:49.634 --> 02:50.558
We must hurry.

02:50.559 --> 02:53.503
Your father is waiting for us
at the harbor in Saint-Malo.

02:59.844 --> 03:01.978
Oh!

03:05.584 --> 03:06.984
Papa!

03:06.985 --> 03:08.085
Francoise.

03:08.086 --> 03:10.354
Madeleine. Thank God.

03:13.058 --> 03:14.458
Where are they all going?

03:14.459 --> 03:16.026
The Germans have closed the harbor.

03:16.027 --> 03:18.395
So we could've
been in England days ago?

03:18.396 --> 03:20.307
But no, you insisted
Francoise take this

03:20.308 --> 03:22.156
stupid exam, and now we're prisoners?

03:22.834 --> 03:25.569
We are not prisoners.
We are French citizens.

03:25.570 --> 03:28.606
Yes. With Nazi monsters.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.938
That was Hervé, calling from Tremblay.

04:01.673 --> 04:03.073
German troops have
commandeered the house.

04:03.074 --> 04:04.542
Bastards.

04:04.543 --> 04:06.911
They think they can just
take whatever they want.

04:06.912 --> 04:09.380
They do have guns and tanks.

04:09.381 --> 04:11.548
And it could have been much worse.

04:12.617 --> 04:15.185
Maya and Marie-Thérèse
could have been there.

04:21.358 --> 04:22.726
Get the car.

04:22.727 --> 04:24.395
Pablo, it's 300 miles.

04:24.396 --> 04:25.896
Then we better get on the road.

04:25.897 --> 04:28.265
And what are you
going to do when we get there?

04:28.266 --> 04:30.366
Ask the Nazis politely to
give you back your house.

04:30.869 --> 04:32.303
I don't care about the house.

04:32.304 --> 04:33.404
Then what?

04:33.405 --> 04:35.005
We are gonna steal my art.

05:08.206 --> 05:09.440
Put as much as you can in the car.

05:09.441 --> 05:10.774
The rest in Hervé's truck.

05:10.775 --> 05:12.976
Hurry!

05:23.088 --> 05:24.855
You should've seen it, my love.

05:24.856 --> 05:28.225
We were a band of gypsies,
picking the Nazis clean.

05:28.593 --> 05:29.727
What if you'd been caught?

05:29.728 --> 05:31.228
Oh, impossible.

05:31.229 --> 05:35.199
No, my African masks protect
me against all evil spirits.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.267
This isn't a joke, Pablo.
They might have killed you.

05:37.268 --> 05:40.204
But they didn't. Did they?

05:52.150 --> 05:55.986
So you saved your paintings?

05:55.987 --> 05:57.187
Now, we should go.

05:57.188 --> 06:00.824
Go? Where?

06:00.825 --> 06:04.228
To America. It's too dangerous here.

06:14.172 --> 06:17.741
Huh.

06:17.742 --> 06:20.764
So, when the fascists were far away

06:20.765 --> 06:24.205
in Spain, y-you wanted to fight them.

06:26.451 --> 06:29.853
You wanted me to paint Guernica.

06:30.655 --> 06:33.490
And now that they are on our doorstep,
y-y-you just want to run away?

07:00.285 --> 07:05.923
Take it. Go on.

07:08.793 --> 07:12.529
Play that game you played
the night we first met.

07:12.530 --> 07:15.833
Spread your fingers apart and
drive the blade between them.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.701
Pablo, please...

07:17.702 --> 07:20.571
Even when you missed and
drew blood, you didn't flinch.

07:20.572 --> 07:21.872
I was drunk.

07:21.873 --> 07:27.644
You were fearless.

07:30.014 --> 07:32.216
You do what you want.

07:32.217 --> 07:36.486
But I am going back to Paris.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.799
Come with me, Carles.

08:23.134 --> 08:25.102
Show Manach some of your work.

08:25.103 --> 08:27.237
Nonell says he has a
soft spot for Spaniards.

08:27.238 --> 08:29.573
Mmm. Well, you be the picador.

08:29.574 --> 08:31.508
Soften up the bull.

08:31.509 --> 08:34.912
And when you've weakened him,
I'll come in for the kill.

08:35.513 --> 08:37.147
I will get it.

08:37.148 --> 08:39.783
You're onto something,
and clearly I am not.

08:45.223 --> 08:47.090
Oh, uh, I'm looking for Pablo.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.092
You must be Pallarés.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.928
I see you've found our tailor.

08:50.929 --> 08:53.330
Manuel, I'm so
glad you're finally here.

08:54.265 --> 08:55.499
Where were you?

08:55.500 --> 08:56.600
You were supposed to
meet me at the station?

08:56.601 --> 08:59.469
Ah, I lost track of the time.

08:59.637 --> 09:01.505
I can see why.

09:01.506 --> 09:04.007
Pallarés, say hello to Odette.

09:08.746 --> 09:11.315
Antoinette?

09:11.316 --> 09:13.951
Lovely to meet you.

09:13.952 --> 09:16.486
And Germaine.

09:17.188 --> 09:20.023
We'll make coffee.

09:20.859 --> 09:22.459
Friends of Nonell's.

09:22.460 --> 09:23.660
Mm.

09:23.661 --> 09:25.195
They were here when we arrived.

09:25.196 --> 09:26.830
We didn't think it was
polite to ask them to leave.

09:26.831 --> 09:29.666
No, of course not.

09:30.034 --> 09:33.203
Since Pablo prefers Odette,
I'll have to satisfy the other two.

09:33.571 --> 09:37.708
But I suppose I could find it in
my heart to lend you Antoinette.

09:41.613 --> 09:44.514
Is he serious?

09:44.515 --> 09:48.151
Welcome to Paris.

09:50.521 --> 09:51.621
What do you think?

09:55.093 --> 09:58.829
Spanish painters are as
common as mud in Paris these days.

09:59.998 --> 10:02.399
Very well, then.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.836
I will find someone who
likes the common touch.

10:06.738 --> 10:09.206
I'll take three on consignment.

10:09.207 --> 10:12.843
See what I can do. No promises.

10:13.678 --> 10:15.979
I'll give you 100 francs.

10:15.980 --> 10:19.182
For all three of them.

10:19.384 --> 10:22.519
Hmm, I don't know, Berte.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.689
Young Spaniards are all
the rage these days.

10:25.690 --> 10:29.192
If you had another buyer,
you would not have come to me.

10:30.995 --> 10:32.896
Now tell me, what is he like?

10:32.897 --> 10:36.366
This, Picasso.

10:36.467 --> 10:39.936
Small. Intense.

10:40.538 --> 10:43.340
And exclusive to me, in
case you're wondering.

10:44.876 --> 10:47.044
It wasn't easy.

10:47.045 --> 10:50.580
But I managed to sell all three.

10:52.517 --> 10:54.551
Quite an achievement.

10:54.552 --> 10:58.188
Considering Spaniards
are as common as mud.

10:58.690 --> 11:00.465
After my expenses and commission,

11:00.466 --> 11:01.982
you've earned yourself 50 francs.

11:02.760 --> 11:07.798
Or, I could give you
150 francs every month.

11:08.967 --> 11:12.369
In return, I own
everything you produce.

11:17.208 --> 11:18.942
Everything?

11:18.943 --> 11:20.510
You keep the stipend
whether I sell the work or not.

11:20.511 --> 11:23.280
The risk is entirely mine.

11:23.281 --> 11:27.117
This is the way the art business
is conducted in Paris, Picasso.

11:27.618 --> 11:30.320
Ask around, it's more than fair.

11:37.428 --> 11:40.097
Can you pay in advance?

11:45.103 --> 11:46.536
To Picasso!

11:46.537 --> 11:49.372
To Picasso! Picasso.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.712
Let's dance.

12:06.491 --> 12:09.526
I am in love with Germaine.

12:09.794 --> 12:11.028
You're drunk.

12:11.029 --> 12:13.463
True. But I'm also quite serious.

12:13.464 --> 12:17.267
I can't paint, I can't sleep.

12:17.268 --> 12:19.436
I want to marry her.

12:19.437 --> 12:22.806
Carles, we are not in Spain anymore.

12:22.807 --> 12:26.276
You don't have to marry a woman
or pay her to get her to...

12:26.277 --> 12:31.148
I haven't, gotten her to,

12:34.952 --> 12:37.521
I know, I know, I've-I've boasted,

12:37.522 --> 12:40.290
but the studio's always so crowded.

12:40.291 --> 12:42.659
W-We're never alone.

12:42.660 --> 12:45.462
There's no one at the studio now.

12:56.441 --> 12:58.909
I can't wait anymore.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.610
I can't.

13:00.611 --> 13:02.112
Mmm.

13:02.113 --> 13:03.647
I...

13:03.648 --> 13:06.049
I'll help you, okay.

13:07.485 --> 13:11.588
I, I, I, I, I mean,

13:16.294 --> 13:20.597
I, I, I can't.

13:34.612 --> 13:35.846
Carles...

13:35.847 --> 13:39.282
I'm sorry...

14:54.225 --> 14:55.892
It's so alive.

14:55.893 --> 14:59.896
I can almost smell the
smoke, and the perfume.

14:59.897 --> 15:01.965
Didn't I tell you, Arthur?

15:01.966 --> 15:06.236
He is one of the most exciting young
artists working in Paris today.

15:07.972 --> 15:09.472
How much?

15:09.473 --> 15:13.109
250.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.947
Arthur Huc is one of the most
influential collectors in Paris,

15:16.948 --> 15:20.417
and he thought your painting could
have been a Degas or Lautrec.

15:20.418 --> 15:21.718
You're getting noticed.

15:21.719 --> 15:23.153
Yes.

15:23.154 --> 15:26.890
For copying the styles
of other painters.

15:27.291 --> 15:29.559
It's what sells and I need more.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.294
Don't be so gloomy, Pablo.

15:31.295 --> 15:34.731
You're going to be famous.

15:36.601 --> 15:38.568
What about Casagemas?

15:38.569 --> 15:42.439
Have you seen his
watercolor of Germaine?

15:42.540 --> 15:43.607
It's-It's, uh...

15:43.608 --> 15:44.820
- Show him, Carles.
- Mm-hmm.

15:44.821 --> 15:46.535
I'm sure it's charming, but I

15:46.536 --> 15:48.505
need more paintings from you, Pablo.

15:49.250 --> 15:53.153
Work up some more dancehall scenes.

16:00.495 --> 16:03.797
I see you're an admirer of Matisse.

16:03.798 --> 16:06.333
You think it's derivative.

16:09.938 --> 16:11.939
Maybe my father was right.

16:11.940 --> 16:13.840
About what?

16:13.841 --> 16:16.743
He wants me to be a lawyer.

16:19.147 --> 16:23.116
What's the point of that if there's
no law in the world anymore?

16:25.019 --> 16:30.290
Well, I can teach you what I know.

16:34.295 --> 16:39.064
The first thing is,
there is no shame in

16:39.065 --> 16:41.657
being derivative when
you're starting out.

16:42.842 --> 16:45.978
Your friend Matisse is the best.

16:45.979 --> 16:48.480
For color.

16:48.481 --> 16:52.484
But if you want to learn how to
draw line, you must study Picasso.

16:54.554 --> 16:56.524
Sabartés, I thought you were going

16:56.525 --> 16:58.481
to find me some bronze
for my sculptures.

16:59.926 --> 17:02.252
It seems the Nazis have confiscated

17:02.253 --> 17:04.153
it all to make their shiny bullets.

17:05.231 --> 17:08.767
So, I suppose you couldn't
find me any cadmium red either.

17:09.068 --> 17:12.069
'Cause they need it
to paint swastikas.

17:12.070 --> 17:14.772
No one forced you to stay in Paris.

17:14.773 --> 17:18.743
I would go back to Spain if
that fascist pig wasn't in charge.

17:21.814 --> 17:23.915
To see Pallarés in Horta.

17:23.916 --> 17:29.454
That was the last time in
my life I felt truly free.

17:44.938 --> 17:48.807
Good evening. Is Herr Picasso at home?

17:55.214 --> 17:57.716
You be careful with that.

17:57.717 --> 18:00.619
Is Herr Rosenberg staying here?

18:00.620 --> 18:01.853
No.

18:01.854 --> 18:04.523
Herr Goldstein, perhaps?

18:04.524 --> 18:06.291
I told you last time.

18:06.292 --> 18:08.961
And the time before.

18:08.962 --> 18:12.898
Here there is only Picasso.

18:13.533 --> 18:17.536
So then, you did this?

18:19.539 --> 18:23.975
No. You did.

18:26.346 --> 18:29.481
You know what, Picasso, we
have been very gracious to you.

18:31.651 --> 18:34.353
But we could take away
everything in this room.

18:34.354 --> 18:37.022
And everyone.

18:38.658 --> 18:41.993
I am told your General
Muller is an admirer of mine.

18:49.836 --> 18:54.773
Go ahead. Take me.

18:56.109 --> 18:58.551
You see what happens
when he finds out you

18:58.552 --> 19:01.237
arrested the most famous
artist in the world.

19:03.950 --> 19:07.853
Perhaps it is you who will disappear.

19:16.729 --> 19:19.898
Until next time, Herr Picasso.

19:42.990 --> 19:44.123
It's lovely.

19:44.124 --> 19:46.359
It's not as lovely as you.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.694
You're so silly.

19:47.695 --> 19:50.630
Why? Because I'm in love with you.

19:50.631 --> 19:55.490
Then I happily declare I am the
silliest man in all of Paris!

19:55.736 --> 19:57.837
Carles, don't!

19:57.838 --> 20:00.039
I'm going to buy you that necklace.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.240
With what?

20:01.241 --> 20:02.775
You haven't got a single
centime to your name.

20:02.776 --> 20:04.043
I'll sell my paintings.

20:04.044 --> 20:06.779
The clothes off my back.

20:06.780 --> 20:08.481
I have to go.

20:08.482 --> 20:10.883
Germaine, Germaine, wait, wait. Wait.

20:10.884 --> 20:13.086
I thought we were
spending the day together.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.888
I'm meeting someone.

20:16.390 --> 20:18.725
Who?

20:18.726 --> 20:20.993
- Carles, you're very sweet...
- Who?

20:20.994 --> 20:24.430
But I don't answer to you.

20:27.134 --> 20:29.569
I'm worried about you.

20:29.570 --> 20:31.804
When was the last time
you picked up a brush?

20:31.805 --> 20:33.339
I can't paint.

20:33.340 --> 20:36.142
Not until I know Germaine is mine.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.781
Lend me some money, Pablo.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.116
For what?

20:43.117 --> 20:45.785
There is a necklace that she admired.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.086
Carles.

20:47.087 --> 20:48.955
Please, Pablo, please. Please.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.289
Carles.

20:50.290 --> 20:53.659
Pablo, please.

21:06.507 --> 21:10.109
Buy some paints instead.

21:11.712 --> 21:16.215
Thank you.
I will pay you back. I will.

21:20.187 --> 21:22.355
Trust me, Madam.

21:22.356 --> 21:25.291
Picasso here is the most
exciting young painter in Paris.

21:25.292 --> 21:29.028
A portrait by him will make
you the envy of your friends.

21:29.530 --> 21:32.832
Can he paint me in
the style of Renoir?

21:32.833 --> 21:35.168
Picasso can paint
in any style you want.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.904
Renoir, Lautrec, Degas...

21:37.905 --> 21:39.372
Very well then.

21:39.373 --> 21:42.141
As long as he makes me look pretty.

21:47.481 --> 21:50.583
I am sorry, Madam.

21:50.584 --> 21:54.020
But I'm not nearly
talented enough to do that.

21:56.490 --> 22:01.427
Pablo!

22:05.365 --> 22:11.537
Pablo! Pablo! Empty your pockets.

22:12.172 --> 22:13.958
What?

22:13.959 --> 22:15.228
How much do you have left of your

22:15.229 --> 22:17.640
stipend after feeding
and housing all those

22:17.641 --> 22:20.810
bloodsucking friends of yours?

22:23.672 --> 22:27.141
I didn't come to Paris
to paint dancehall scenes.

22:27.142 --> 22:29.944
And fat cows in the style of Renoir.

22:30.045 --> 22:31.813
You need to eat.

22:31.814 --> 22:35.550
And to eat, you need
to paint a few cows.

22:42.157 --> 22:43.825
Hey, save some for the rest of us.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.498
Hm. Ah!

22:50.499 --> 22:53.234
Behold, the incomparable Casagemas.

22:55.571 --> 22:56.938
Carles...

22:56.939 --> 22:58.239
I bought you something.

22:58.240 --> 23:01.276
I heard a rumor about you, Carles.

23:01.277 --> 23:04.746
That you put your brush down and
now you cannot pick it up again.

23:09.084 --> 23:11.152
Well, go ahead. Open it.

23:11.153 --> 23:12.620
I can't accept this, Carles.

23:12.621 --> 23:14.289
Why not?

23:14.290 --> 23:16.791
Because I'm not in love with you.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.128
I can change your mind.

23:20.129 --> 23:21.129
No, you can't.

23:21.130 --> 23:22.263
Carles.

23:22.264 --> 23:23.331
Yes...

23:23.332 --> 23:24.766
Carles, relax. Have a drink.

23:24.767 --> 23:27.001
It's the necklace you admired.

23:27.002 --> 23:28.369
Please just let me put it on you.

23:28.370 --> 23:29.671
No, Carles. No, no.

23:29.672 --> 23:30.939
Please. Why? Why not?

23:30.940 --> 23:33.975
Because you cannot satisfy me.

23:41.817 --> 23:47.355
I'm sorry, Carles. I'm sorry.

23:57.132 --> 23:58.533
Oh.

23:58.534 --> 24:02.370
Carles, wait. Carles wait!

25:01.063 --> 25:05.766
Do you know where I can
find something a little stronger?

25:33.128 --> 25:38.933
I heard a rumor about you,
Carles, put your brush down,

25:39.568 --> 25:42.303
and now you cannot pick it up again.

25:42.889 --> 25:46.941
I'm not in love with you.
Because you cannot satisfy me.

26:55.544 --> 26:59.147
Do I actually disgust you that much?

27:19.435 --> 27:21.903
You should have
forgotten about me, Pablo.

27:21.904 --> 27:24.372
You need a warm bath
and a strong pot of coffee.

27:24.373 --> 27:25.840
That's all.

27:25.841 --> 27:27.540
You think that's going to fix me?

27:27.541 --> 27:28.410
Carles.

27:28.411 --> 27:31.179
- I can't pay you what I owe.
- Forget it.

27:31.180 --> 27:34.682
I can't paint.

27:35.117 --> 27:39.521
I-I can't satisfy the woman I love.

27:47.063 --> 27:50.732
What am I going to do, Pablo?

27:50.733 --> 27:55.203
What am I going to do?

27:58.007 --> 28:00.208
He'll be fine once he sobers up.

28:00.209 --> 28:01.743
He can't stay here.

28:01.744 --> 28:03.111
He won't survive it.

28:03.112 --> 28:04.913
So? Cable his parents.

28:04.914 --> 28:06.414
They will put him on a train.

28:06.415 --> 28:09.818
Look at him, Manuel.
He can't travel by himself.

28:10.653 --> 28:12.654
You can't leave now.

28:12.655 --> 28:15.490
Not when you're having
so much success.

28:15.491 --> 28:17.258
Painting portraits of society ladies.

28:17.259 --> 28:18.727
Imitating other artists.

28:18.728 --> 28:19.728
So? Do something different.

28:19.729 --> 28:20.729
It's not that simple!

28:20.730 --> 28:23.965
It is! Remember Horta?

28:23.966 --> 28:26.634
You weren't just copying
some fancy French painters.

28:26.635 --> 28:28.169
Because I'd never seen any.

28:28.170 --> 28:29.637
Exactly. So you
were painting what you saw.

28:29.638 --> 28:31.239
And what you felt.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.475
So go back to doing that.
Something original.

28:33.476 --> 28:36.244
I don't know,

28:41.817 --> 28:45.687
I don't know if I can.

28:54.363 --> 28:57.899
So are you leaving
now to help Casagemas?

28:57.900 --> 29:00.058
Or are you leaving
because you are afraid

29:00.059 --> 29:02.394
that you can't paint
your perfect painting?

29:14.650 --> 29:18.486
I need to finish packing.

29:22.024 --> 29:25.860
At least you'll finish something.

29:41.325 --> 29:43.193
Tell us about Paris, Pablito.

29:43.194 --> 29:45.495
It must have been so exciting.

29:45.496 --> 29:47.864
A feast for the eyes, auntie.

29:47.865 --> 29:51.501
You were a great
success, I suppose? Hm?

29:51.502 --> 29:53.836
I sold quite a few paintings.

29:53.837 --> 29:55.312
Oh, how wonderful.

29:55.313 --> 30:00.607
Look who has come, Salvador.
All the way from Paris.

30:01.078 --> 30:04.013
Happy New Year, Uncle. Ah.

30:04.515 --> 30:07.050
This is my friend, Carles Casagemas.

30:07.051 --> 30:08.885
He's also a painter.

30:08.886 --> 30:10.720
It's an honor, señor.

30:10.721 --> 30:13.256
After the-the
noise and glare of Paris,

30:13.257 --> 30:16.359
we thought a few weeks by the
sea could do us some good.

30:19.029 --> 30:23.266
If you're going to stay in my
house, you're going to need a haircut.

30:24.568 --> 30:26.069
And a shave.

30:26.070 --> 30:27.937
Of course, Uncle.

30:27.938 --> 30:32.742
Uh, but, after paying for the journey,
we're a little short of funds.

30:50.327 --> 30:54.464
Buy yourself a
respectable suit as well.

30:57.067 --> 30:59.168
Charming fellow, your uncle.

30:59.169 --> 31:02.305
To hell with him. And the barber.

31:02.306 --> 31:05.408
I like our hair the way it is.

31:05.909 --> 31:09.011
So, what are we going
to do with all that money?

31:09.546 --> 31:12.515
I have an idea.

31:13.917 --> 31:17.186
I need you to take
special care of my friend.

31:17.187 --> 31:19.522
He's just had his heart broken.

31:25.429 --> 31:29.132
Whoever she is, I'll
make you forget her.

31:48.686 --> 31:53.723
Don't, don't...

31:54.158 --> 31:57.627
don't waste your time.

32:02.633 --> 32:03.666
Hey.

32:03.667 --> 32:04.901
Well?

32:04.902 --> 32:06.536
Well, you were right, my friend.

32:06.537 --> 32:09.572
Much more enjoyable than a haircut.

32:10.774 --> 32:15.878
Show your ration card!
Only one loaf, today!

32:15.913 --> 32:19.523
So what would
you like for dinner tonight?

32:19.658 --> 32:22.159
Maybe some cheese with some soup.

32:23.495 --> 32:25.563
What is it, darling?

32:29.368 --> 32:31.068
Come on. Come on, cherie.

32:55.027 --> 32:56.673
Well, that should be enough

32:56.674 --> 32:58.529
coal to last until
the end of the week.

32:58.530 --> 33:00.698
I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner
but with the curfew and...

33:00.699 --> 33:02.500
It's all right.

33:02.501 --> 33:03.901
Yeah.

33:03.902 --> 33:05.503
We've just missed you.

33:05.504 --> 33:06.837
Haven't we, Maya?

33:06.838 --> 33:13.277
And for you,
princesa, a special treat.

33:19.117 --> 33:21.085
Pablo.

33:25.490 --> 33:28.859
She, she saw two dead
resistance fighters today.

33:28.860 --> 33:31.395
Hanging from ropes.

33:31.830 --> 33:35.266
Huh. You have a pair of scissors?

33:37.102 --> 33:39.704
Uh, yes.

33:43.141 --> 33:45.409
Yeah, ah! You did it!

33:45.410 --> 33:48.379
Look. Pretty. Isn't she?

33:50.215 --> 33:52.783
Oh, you should meet her friends.

33:52.784 --> 33:56.954
Huh! Take it. Eat your apple.

34:02.261 --> 34:03.594
Stay the night.

34:03.595 --> 34:05.830
No, I can't.

34:05.831 --> 34:07.365
Because you are going to see her.

34:07.366 --> 34:09.500
Because I must work.

34:09.501 --> 34:11.636
The Nazis won't
even let you show your art.

34:11.637 --> 34:16.072
I know but, uh, they
cannot stop me from making it.

34:18.277 --> 34:20.678
Good night.

34:37.429 --> 34:41.699
Well hello, little paloma.

34:42.100 --> 34:44.502
Have you come to visit me?

35:03.722 --> 35:05.790
There is fighting in the street.

35:05.791 --> 35:07.858
I was nearly killed by a stray bullet.

35:07.859 --> 35:10.161
Topics such as this no longer matter.

35:10.162 --> 35:11.962
You promised me.

35:11.963 --> 35:13.964
But you know very
well I have tried everything.

35:13.965 --> 35:16.167
Oh, you could
petition the courts again.

35:16.168 --> 35:17.535
You are an important man.

35:17.536 --> 35:19.670
I'm also an old man.

35:19.671 --> 35:22.039
What would be the point
of marrying you now?

35:22.341 --> 35:24.642
Maya is eight years old.

35:24.643 --> 35:26.877
She wants to know why her
papa doesn't eat with us...

35:27.045 --> 35:28.454
Sorry, mademoiselle, but he

35:28.455 --> 35:30.269
is not, mademoiselle, you cannot...

35:34.319 --> 35:35.353
Why is she here?

35:35.354 --> 35:36.587
Get out.

35:36.588 --> 35:38.189
Mademoiselles, please.

35:38.190 --> 35:39.824
Why is she here, Pablo?

35:39.825 --> 35:45.355
Dora, uh, you know very well...

35:45.864 --> 35:49.900
that Marie-Therese
is the only woman I love.

36:04.549 --> 36:06.917
Pablo...

36:12.090 --> 36:16.560
You heard Pablo. You may leave now.

36:22.267 --> 36:25.870
Pablo...

36:27.406 --> 36:30.474
Go. I will you take home.

36:57.002 --> 37:00.804
I knew you'd choose me.

37:13.518 --> 37:15.853
You can go, too.

37:15.854 --> 37:17.688
But...

37:17.689 --> 37:20.791
Yeah, I need to be alone, now.

37:43.014 --> 37:45.549
So, you are finished with Dora.

37:46.451 --> 37:48.852
Of course not.

37:50.055 --> 37:52.189
And Marie-Therese?

37:52.324 --> 37:55.392
I love Marie-Therese.

37:57.529 --> 38:03.500
She's, kind and soft and she
does everything I want her to.

38:10.208 --> 38:14.845
And I love Dora
because she's, brilliant...

38:17.048 --> 38:20.317
Talented.

38:20.485 --> 38:25.222
And yet you treat them so cruelly.

38:29.694 --> 38:32.462
I can't remember the last time either

38:32.463 --> 38:34.956
of them made me want
to pick up a brush.

38:38.837 --> 38:42.606
Or the last time I made a
picture worth looking at.

38:48.847 --> 38:52.049
I need something new.

39:00.163 --> 39:03.198
Ole! Ole!

39:11.541 --> 39:13.208
Ooh.

39:13.209 --> 39:15.210
Oh, he's all right. He's not hurt.

39:16.221 --> 39:18.474
My father had a friend
who used to say,

39:18.475 --> 39:21.340
it was every Spanish man's paradise.

39:21.341 --> 39:23.141
Bullfight in the morning.

39:23.142 --> 39:25.177
Bar in the afternoon.

39:25.178 --> 39:27.646
Whorehouse at night.

39:27.981 --> 39:29.815
Wise man, your father's friends.

39:29.816 --> 39:32.084
Ole!

39:32.218 --> 39:35.721
After he took me here
the first time, I painted.

39:36.155 --> 39:39.091
All in reds and golds.

39:40.059 --> 39:42.594
It was a terrible picture.

39:42.595 --> 39:46.732
But my mother, she thought
it was a masterpiece.

39:49.669 --> 39:52.571
But you haven't painted
anything since we arrived in Málaga.

39:55.708 --> 39:57.175
I'd rather make trouble with you.

39:57.176 --> 39:58.616
Mm.

39:58.617 --> 40:00.299
'Cause you're trying to
help me forget about

40:00.300 --> 40:03.706
Germaine, or because
you're avoiding work?

40:03.883 --> 40:09.688
Ole! Ole! Ole!

40:11.758 --> 40:14.893
Well, it's time
for you to pick up a brush.

40:14.894 --> 40:17.596
And for me to go.

40:18.464 --> 40:19.865
Carles...

40:19.866 --> 40:22.100
You've worked a miracle, Pablo.

40:22.101 --> 40:24.102
I feel better than I have in months.

40:24.103 --> 40:25.370
You cannot go back to Paris.

40:25.371 --> 40:26.905
No, no, don't worry.

40:26.906 --> 40:28.640
I-I'm going back to Barcelona.

40:28.641 --> 40:31.043
To stay with my parents.

40:31.044 --> 40:33.245
Ole!

41:16.789 --> 41:18.123
You came.

41:18.124 --> 41:19.658
You look well.

41:19.659 --> 41:22.661
Oh, you look beautiful.

41:25.364 --> 41:27.032
I am sorry I embarrassed you.

41:27.033 --> 41:28.600
Oh...

41:28.601 --> 41:30.368
And I really wanted
to come and meet you...

41:30.369 --> 41:31.937
No, it-it doesn't matter anymore...

41:31.938 --> 41:34.339
You must know I
am with someone else now.

41:34.340 --> 41:36.108
So we cannot be more than friends.

41:36.109 --> 41:39.211
I hope you can understand that.

41:42.315 --> 41:44.049
I'm happy for you.

41:44.050 --> 41:46.484
Really?

41:47.487 --> 41:49.988
We should get the circus together.

41:49.989 --> 41:53.458
Have dinner, celebrate my
triumphant return to Paris.

41:53.993 --> 41:56.228
Wonderful.

42:07.173 --> 42:09.841
Picasso.

42:10.176 --> 42:13.145
Is that what you're
calling yourself now?

42:13.146 --> 42:15.046
Because you're ashamed
of your father's name?

42:15.047 --> 42:16.047
My name?

42:16.048 --> 42:17.312
Of course not, Uncle.

42:17.313 --> 42:18.998
And you expect me to give you

42:18.999 --> 42:20.676
money to make these obscene journals?

42:20.753 --> 42:22.988
It's not obscene. And it's not a gift.

42:22.989 --> 42:24.823
It-It's an investment.

42:24.824 --> 42:27.058
Pablo. You used to
make beautiful paintings.

42:29.028 --> 42:30.862
And now you what?

42:30.863 --> 42:34.065
A caricaturist?

42:36.369 --> 42:39.404
Don't squander your talent, Pablo.

42:40.673 --> 42:43.082
Alain Cuny is the most talented

42:43.083 --> 42:47.208
actor alive and he just
invited me to dinner.

42:47.947 --> 42:49.548
How did you manage that?

42:49.549 --> 42:52.379
I waited for him
backstage after his matinee.

42:52.418 --> 42:53.752
He thought it was very charming.

42:53.753 --> 42:57.289
And he offered to take
me to the Catalan.

42:57.290 --> 42:59.024
The Catalan, Francoise!

42:59.025 --> 43:00.926
Eh, he probably
just wants to take you to bed.

43:00.927 --> 43:02.694
I certainly hope so.

43:02.695 --> 43:04.796
He must be 40. He's probably married.

43:04.964 --> 43:07.866
So? He's famous and handsome.

43:07.867 --> 43:10.068
But I can't go alone.

43:10.369 --> 43:12.070
You must come with me.

43:12.071 --> 43:14.673
No. There's too much to
do here if we're going to be ready.

43:14.674 --> 43:16.074
Oh!

43:16.075 --> 43:19.077
The Catalan buys oysters
on the black market.

43:19.078 --> 43:20.779
When was the last
time you had oysters?

43:20.780 --> 43:23.214
And champagne?

43:25.785 --> 43:27.385
She's his mistress?

43:27.386 --> 43:29.154
One of them.

43:29.255 --> 43:30.755
How many does he have?

43:30.756 --> 43:33.158
How many women has he painted?

43:37.096 --> 43:38.263
To art!

43:38.264 --> 43:39.664
To art!

43:39.665 --> 43:41.766
And to love!

43:41.767 --> 43:45.804
Two endeavors at which
I have failed miserably.

43:46.505 --> 43:48.173
Oh, Carles. Don't say that.

43:48.174 --> 43:50.809
Here, Germaine. Please.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.815
Would you read this for me, please?

43:59.218 --> 44:04.990
The chief of police and
your mother, why would you...

44:08.094 --> 44:09.294
One for you...

44:09.295 --> 44:11.296
What the hell are you doing?

44:12.698 --> 44:15.934
And one for me.

44:16.769 --> 44:18.536
Carles, no!

44:24.777 --> 44:26.778
It was horrible.

44:26.779 --> 44:29.481
The blood. The brains, everywhere.

44:31.183 --> 44:34.019
It is my fault.

44:34.220 --> 44:36.855
What are you talking about?

44:36.856 --> 44:38.790
I never should have believed him.

44:38.791 --> 44:41.660
I shouldn't have let him leave,
or I should've gone with him.

44:41.661 --> 44:45.230
How are you supposed to know?

44:47.166 --> 44:50.402
God. God punished me again.

44:50.403 --> 44:53.872
Because I wasn't painting.

44:53.873 --> 44:56.908
Jesus Christ. Pablo.

44:58.144 --> 45:00.588
Do you really believe
that God is killing

45:00.589 --> 45:03.338
people because the great
Picasso didn't paint

45:03.683 --> 45:07.152
another one of his masterpieces today?

46:22.995 --> 46:25.663
Where are you going?

46:29.802 --> 46:31.803
He's coming over.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.507
Ah.

46:35.508 --> 46:37.175
Do you like cherries?

46:37.176 --> 46:39.110
That's very kind, Monsieur Picasso.

46:39.111 --> 46:40.478
Won't you join us?

46:40.479 --> 46:42.781
Oh, I-I'm afraid I can't.

46:42.782 --> 46:45.650
But I would very much like to
meet your dinner companions.

46:47.086 --> 46:48.420
Ah, well.

46:48.421 --> 46:50.488
Francoise is-is the intellectual.

46:50.489 --> 46:52.357
And Genevieve is the great beauty.

46:52.358 --> 46:54.692
Doesn't she resemble a Caravaggio?

46:54.693 --> 46:57.295
Tell me about
the intellectual one here.

46:57.296 --> 46:59.664
Francoise is a
virtuous woman, I'm afraid.

47:00.533 --> 47:02.967
Ah, but not for religious reasons.

47:02.968 --> 47:07.984
Her objections to lovemaking are
based entirely on Platonic ideals.

47:08.040 --> 47:10.428
And how do they pass the time, your

47:10.429 --> 47:12.934
Caravaggio and your
Platonic philosopher?

47:13.345 --> 47:15.213
We're artists, actually.

47:15.214 --> 47:16.815
Oh.

47:16.816 --> 47:20.385
Uh, you certainly don't look like
any artists I have ever met.

47:21.620 --> 47:23.289
Well, for your information,

47:23.290 --> 47:25.290
Monsieur, we're having
a joint exhibition of

47:25.291 --> 47:28.293
drawings and paintings at a
very well-respected gallery.

47:28.294 --> 47:31.396
Rue Boissy d'Anglas.

47:33.032 --> 47:35.567
Well, I am, I'm also an artist.

47:35.568 --> 47:37.969
Oh, are you really?

47:38.404 --> 47:42.207
You must come and visit me some time.

47:42.208 --> 47:45.577
To see some of my work.

48:32.224 --> 48:38.196
You are going to
paint her, aren't you?
