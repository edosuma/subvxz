WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.374
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.503 --> 00:04.459
You remember that woman
that I look like?

00:04.588 --> 00:05.543
- In the Colorado Kid pic?

00:05.672 --> 00:08.049
- Do you think there's a chance
that her name could be Lucy?

00:08.175 --> 00:10.416
So you seriously
can't feel pain?

00:17.351 --> 00:18.386
- Happy birthday!

00:18.519 --> 00:20.055
- Julia Carr.
I'm Eleanor's daughter.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.393
I just got back in town.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.807
- She was in Ethiopia.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.305
- With Doctors Without Borders.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.351
[woman screams]

00:25.484 --> 00:27.395
- Vaughn Carpenter
was a chameleon.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.395
Somebody right here in this room
is a killer.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.395
- Oh, please!

00:31.532 --> 00:32.612
[gunshot]

00:33.575 --> 00:34.564
How did you know it was me?

00:34.701 --> 00:36.487
- Audrey...
I can feel her touch.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.985
- I thought
she could help me,

00:38.121 --> 00:39.281
like Lucy.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.574
- I got you a gift.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.742
Lucy Ripley.

00:41.875 --> 00:42.830
The boy...

00:42.960 --> 00:45.417
standing next to Lucy
in the Colorado Kid photo...

00:45.546 --> 00:46.752
is me.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.091
- The only time I was in school
after 3:00 pm.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.006
was for detention.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.968
- What are you trying to do,
swipe a lunch box?

00:59.101 --> 01:00.432
- Maybe.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.347
Some of those
are collectibles.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.314
For the record, this place
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.934
- Huh, I had you pegged
as one of the cool kids.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.653
- For the record,
nobody was cool in high school,

01:13.782 --> 01:14.771
not even me.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.897
- Yeah.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.570
- High school,
like so many other things,

01:17.703 --> 01:19.864
should be left in the past
where they belong.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.282
- Wait, wait,
is that your way of saying

01:21.415 --> 01:22.450
you don't want
to help me with this?

01:22.583 --> 01:23.493
- No.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.616
- I find a picture
of the Colorado Kid's death,

01:25.752 --> 01:27.458
and I spend all this time
running around Haven

01:27.588 --> 01:29.203
trying to ID the woman
in the photo,

01:29.339 --> 01:30.749
who could be my mom,

01:30.882 --> 01:32.793
and then after all of that,

01:32.926 --> 01:34.382
you tell me
you were in the picture.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.172
- Okay,
that may have been unfair.

01:36.305 --> 01:37.215
- Yeah, you think?

01:37.347 --> 01:39.679
- I'm gonna try to get Vanessa
to talk to you.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.309
- Okay.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.302
- But she was just
my babysitter.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.303
I haven't even seen her
in over a decade.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.431
And there's one other thing.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.809
I can't remember anything
from that morning...

01:51.945 --> 01:53.481
nothing.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.151
Okay.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.821
How have I not seen you?

02:04.958 --> 02:06.823
You look incredible,

02:06.960 --> 02:08.541
unbelievable.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.626
- Well, I hope it's not
that unbelievable.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.917
I have been
in Portland, mostly.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.837
- Well...

02:15.969 --> 02:17.709
Portland
has been good to you.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.337
[chuckles]

02:20.474 --> 02:22.339
- Maybe I should just
leave you two

02:22.476 --> 02:23.556
to finish catching up.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.346
- I'm sorry.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.470
What can I do to help you?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.140
- This is you, isn't it?

02:37.115 --> 02:39.777
- The woman next to Duke
is your mother?

02:39.910 --> 02:41.320
- That's what I'm trying
to find out.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.910
Her name is Lucy Ripley.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.746
It's been 27 years,

02:46.875 --> 02:48.661
and that morning
is still a mystery.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.206
We don't know
who the Colorado Kid was,

02:51.338 --> 02:52.703
how he died.

02:52.839 --> 02:56.172
So anything you could tell me
that might help me know

02:56.301 --> 02:59.008
why she was there
or what happened...

02:59.137 --> 03:03.597
- Look, I'd—
l'd like to help, but...

03:03.725 --> 03:05.135
- You don't remember
what happened.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.055
- No, not a thing.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.725
- [sighs]
Me either.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.313
- Really?

03:12.442 --> 03:14.433
I mean, that's
a horrible feeling, right?

03:14.569 --> 03:18.153
- Yeah, which is why
I don't talk about it.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.525
- All right, so maybe
I had my hopes up too high.

03:22.661 --> 03:25.448
- Buddha says expectations
lead to suffering.

03:25.580 --> 03:29.243
- So does
quoting the Buddha at me.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.287
- We'll go see
that photographer tonight.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.876
HoW's that?

03:33.004 --> 03:34.084
- Fine.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.079
So are you hot for teacher?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.127
- Babysitter.

03:38.260 --> 03:42.594
A boy's got to have somebody
to play with, right?

03:42.723 --> 03:43.963
- Yeah.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.215
- Xander,
work on communicating

03:46.351 --> 03:48.637
with your words,
all right?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.011
And, Matt,
control your temper.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.230
Don't let it control you.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.519
Okay, now, go.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.945
- Stay out of my way, loser,

04:01.074 --> 04:04.316
or my foot's gonna communicate
with your ass, got it?

04:04.453 --> 04:06.444
- Stop that right now.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.945
Matt West,
my office immediately.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.696
- But he just—
- That's a detention.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.414
Do you want another?

04:14.171 --> 04:16.002
I'm watching you.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.042
Go.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.170
Those boys were
at each other's throats.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.548
You call that
an intervention?

04:29.936 --> 04:32.894
I'm talking to you.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.888
- [gasping]
- Vanessa?

04:35.025 --> 04:37.311
- Principal Manning, l—

04:37.444 --> 04:40.777
I'm just—sorry,
I'm not feeling very well.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.612
- Go home now.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.277
Whether your illness
has anything to do

04:44.409 --> 04:45.990
with your ability
to handle students

04:46.119 --> 04:48.610
is a matter
we will discuss later.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.633
You stop this,
do you hear me?

05:04.763 --> 05:07.345
I'll call the police.
- It's too late.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.055
The police
can't help you, Carlene.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.721
- I want you
to leave me alone.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.684
- Carlene,
don't get in there.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.520
[gasping]

05:22.906 --> 05:24.362
[explosion]

05:34.709 --> 05:37.576
[dramatic music]

05:37.712 --> 05:45.710
J‘J‘

06:10.287 --> 06:11.242
- Cars explode,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.908
and the fire department
investigates, not us.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.122
- Unless there's foul play.

06:16.251 --> 06:19.414
- Okay, no one says
"foul play" anymore.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.582
Look, I'm sorry.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.831
I don't see anything
that's suspicious.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.253
- I'd have to agree.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.967
- Hey, what are you
doing here?

06:28.096 --> 06:30.587
- I did a summer rotation
with the ME a few years ago.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.136
With Mom gone,
they need a hand,

06:33.268 --> 06:35.099
so here I am.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.469
- Hey, so do you think
that this whole car thing—

06:37.606 --> 06:39.016
do you think
that's an accident?

06:39.149 --> 06:40.764
- My preliminary findings.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.813
No injuries inconsistent
with being inside

06:43.945 --> 06:45.060
a really raucous explosion.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.481
- Which bothers me.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.822
I mean,
cars don't just explode.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.156
- Okay, see,
I know that I'm the one

06:50.285 --> 06:51.821
that's usually asking
all the questions,

06:51.953 --> 06:54.114
but I just—
I don't see anything here.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.408
- Well, lwould like
to ask around

06:56.541 --> 06:57.701
if that's okay with you.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.450
- Yeah, no, go—feel free.
That's fine.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.249
- We could talk
to her coworkers.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.341
Thank you, Julia.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.132
- No big.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.301
Hey, Audrey, you want to grab
a bar stool sometime?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.675
Be kind of nice to talk
to someone from outside

07:16.811 --> 07:19.268
this strange little petri dish
once in a while.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.603
- Yeah, sure.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.486
Hey, do you want to get
some coffee?

07:28.615 --> 07:29.855
- You could use some.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.071
- Okay.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.407
- Just black for me, thanks.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.116
I think I'm done
with the fancy stuff.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.076
- Great, high five
for the real thing.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.571
Hey, it's on me.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.798
Nathan, I'm sorry,

07:45.924 --> 07:47.334
but there's just
nothing here.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.628
There's no evidence
of an explosive device.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.503
There's nothing
that seems unnatural.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.597
- There's just—there's
something that I don't like.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.388
Make that two things.

07:59.521 --> 08:03.105
- You always look so happy
to see me.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.770
Miss Audrey,
shall we abscond?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.355
- l-l'm sorry.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.820
We were gonna go talk
to somebody about the photo.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.155
I just—l totally forgot.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.239
- Does that mean
that we're not doing this?

08:14.369 --> 08:16.200
'Cause that's fine.
I'm happy to—

08:16.329 --> 08:18.035
- None of this
is going anywhere tonight.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.155
I'll stay,
poke around a bit more.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.667
You should go.
- No, but you're right.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.249
There's still more people
we can talk to.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.743
I can make some phone calls.

08:24.879 --> 08:28.167
- Parker, you don't need
to be on the clock 24-7.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.209
Go.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.957
- Wow.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.335
Nathan Wuornos
being magnanimous

08:33.471 --> 08:35.678
is a rare and beautiful—

08:35.807 --> 08:38.093
- Please, take him and go.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.386
- All right.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.475
- Okay.
Thank you.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.344
- I was giving you
a compliment, okay?

08:43.481 --> 08:46.063
l'm just saying,
that was a legitimate—

08:46.192 --> 08:47.568
from the heart.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.854
- Come on.
- Okay.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.700
- Just how did you find
Morris Crane?

08:57.829 --> 08:59.490
I turned over half the rocks
in New England

08:59.622 --> 09:01.749
to put a name on
the photographer in the picture.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.786
- I guess ljust turned over
different rocks.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.454
- Yeah.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.578
- So you think this guy's
got other pictures, huh?

09:07.714 --> 09:10.000
- Well, he had a camera
in the photo.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.498
Can only hope so.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.760
- Well, you know,
Buddha says—

09:12.886 --> 09:15.502
- Hey, don't even start
with me.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.596
- You mean nobody else
remembers?

09:18.725 --> 09:21.091
Damn, that's strange.
That's—that's strange.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.888
- That is strange.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.852
I don't remember any of it.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.937
- Well, hell,
why would you want to?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.227
I can't forget it.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.145
They—they came
out of the water,

09:30.278 --> 09:31.438
three, four at a time.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.435
- Who did?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.312
- The guys with the—

09:34.449 --> 09:36.314
with the little things
on their hands.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.611
[clicking tongue]

09:37.744 --> 09:38.824
- You mean claws?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.944
- Yeah, like—
like a lobster.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.116
[clicking tongue]

09:42.248 --> 09:44.113
They were clicking
back and forth at each other.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.330
[clicking tongue]

09:45.460 --> 09:46.415
Some kind of language—

09:46.544 --> 09:48.330
I couldn't quite make out
what they were saying.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.795
- Crazy, table for one.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.957
Let's go.
- You had a camera.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.300
You must have gotten
some film.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.168
- No, they ate it
right in front of me,

09:57.305 --> 09:58.670
little blue bastards.

09:58.807 --> 09:59.796
- Okay, all right.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.594
You know what?
We're gonna see ourselves out.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.307
Thank you.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.597
- It was really good
to meet you.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.891
- Yeah, yeah.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.558
- Sorry, I forgot my coat.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.025
Thank you.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.780
It was all
sort of depressing.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.570
- Actually,
it sounds kind of funny.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.283
- Did we get any progress
on Manning?

10:21.412 --> 10:22.993
- I pulled the log
from her cell phone—

10:23.123 --> 10:24.738
calls to and from teachers,
no surprises.

10:24.874 --> 10:25.989
- Whatever that is.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.866
Nathan, are you okay?

10:28.002 --> 10:30.789
You've been acting odd,
more than usual.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.004
- I'm all right.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.168
See you in the morning.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.631
- All right.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.185
[cell phone rings]

10:51.317 --> 10:52.523
- Hello?

10:52.652 --> 10:55.519
- So I'm looking around
my restaurant today, thinking,

10:55.655 --> 10:57.441
"Is this really me?"

10:57.574 --> 10:59.565
And then it dawns on me.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.532
I know a guidance counselor

11:01.661 --> 11:03.492
who happens to be
kind of cute.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.953
- It's kind of
a bad day, Duke.

11:06.082 --> 11:09.574
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I heard about that.

11:09.711 --> 11:13.044
You know, bad days are seldom
improved by being alone.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.754
Meet me at the Gull.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.464
We can have a drink.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.879
- I'm sorry.
Another time, Duke.

11:19.012 --> 11:23.676
- Night, Laverne.
- Night, sweetie.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.934
- A strawberry daiquiri, huh?

11:33.067 --> 11:36.195
I bet those are pretty hard
to come by in Darfur.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.061
- Some of the stuff
I've drunk out in the bush,

11:38.198 --> 11:39.859
you would not believe.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.107
But when I get anywhere
near civilization,

11:42.243 --> 11:45.280
I can't resist a big
froufrou mess like this.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.529
- Yeah, I can get that.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.200
Julia, I didn't know
Eleanor that well,

11:51.336 --> 11:54.499
but she...

11:54.631 --> 11:55.791
she was...

11:55.924 --> 11:56.959
- Unique?

11:57.091 --> 11:59.082
Yeah.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.460
Mom did it all her way.

12:01.596 --> 12:04.087
She lived
with this crazy troubles stuff.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.135
She died with it.

12:06.267 --> 12:10.601
And she never budged
an inch for anybody.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.971
She had a good run.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.393
- Well, to your mom, then.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.573
- You can have her notes
from the autopsy

12:23.701 --> 12:24.952
if they'd help you.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.238
- What autopsy?

12:26.371 --> 12:27.781
- The Colorado Kid's.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.451
- Wait.
What, she was there?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.743
- She was there.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.741
She was training
with the ME's office.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.118
She helped handle the case.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.462
- She never told me that.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.922
- She was probably waiting
for you to earn it.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.791
Anyway, she took notes
on everything.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.543
You're welcome
to go through them.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.635
- Thank you, Julia.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.380
That's—that's great.

12:54.399 --> 12:57.357
- Hey!
Let me in!

12:57.485 --> 13:00.318
- Lady, we're closing up.
I'm sorry.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.233
- No, no, no, no, no.
Hey! No!

13:06.286 --> 13:09.073
- What you say to me?
Huh?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.617
Get out of here.
This ain't your pool.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.037
- Come on, man.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.500
Let him go.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.836
It's not your pool.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.047
- Unless you want
to take it from me.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.039
[whistle blows]

13:22.176 --> 13:23.302
- Hey, guys.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.009
I'm locking up.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.298
You got less than ten.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.266
- Idiots.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.525
Hey!

13:45.658 --> 13:47.398
What's going on?

13:47.535 --> 13:48.866
Help! Ah!

13:48.995 --> 13:50.110
Ah!

13:50.246 --> 13:52.202
Hey!
- Somebody help!

13:52.332 --> 13:54.698
- Help! No!
Hey!

13:54.834 --> 13:57.291
- No!

13:57.420 --> 14:00.503
- [screaming]

14:00.631 --> 14:02.883
- No!

14:03.009 --> 14:05.000
No!

14:10.350 --> 14:13.217
- New one, even for me.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.095
Kid was boiled.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.222
- Boiled?
- Yeah, boiled, Nathan.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.232
No other trauma.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.277
Two deaths now in one day.

14:28.409 --> 14:31.242
This is why
I left this place.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.953
- We need to start
with the pool heater.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.447
- Because there's any chance

14:35.583 --> 14:36.993
that it could
crank out enough power

14:37.126 --> 14:38.457
to heat all this water
up to a boil?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.497
- No, because we need
to be able to say in the report

14:40.630 --> 14:42.086
that we did.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.216
No, we both know
that Julia's right.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.802
This is not natural,

14:49.931 --> 14:52.297
like the car thing
this afternoon.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.049
High school principal,
high school student—

14:55.186 --> 14:56.972
we have a connection.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.766
- Guess I know
what we're doing tomorrow.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.308
- Yeah, I guess so.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.726
I'll go ahead
and do research.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.896
I think Julia will help,
and you can take witnesses.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.647
- Deal.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.400
- [chuckles]

15:12.537 --> 15:14.949
Deal.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.131
Are you okay?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.339
- Yeah, just, uh,

15:26.467 --> 15:29.049
the smell
got to me.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.385
- Right...

15:31.514 --> 15:33.721
your sensitive nose.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.567
- So there was a woman
near the pool

15:43.693 --> 15:45.399
before Xander's death.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.643
Did you see her?

15:46.779 --> 15:49.361
- Like I told the other cop,
I didn't really see her.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.365
- Kind of busy here, Duke.

15:56.497 --> 16:00.991
- You say that as if I come here
looking for you ever.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.492
[chuckles]

16:02.628 --> 16:03.492
Where's Audrey?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.006
- Working a case,
also busy.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.042
- She really doesn't know

16:07.175 --> 16:08.665
how to cancel appointments,
does she?

16:08.801 --> 16:12.339
- Find someone else
to pal around with.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.882
- That's a fine idea,
Detective.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.175
I'm sorry to interrupt.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.675
Is it weird to hook up
with your old babysitter?

16:18.811 --> 16:19.846
- You're kidding, right?

16:19.979 --> 16:20.934
- No.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.052
- I don't have time
for this.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.475
The sketch artist
is down from Portland.

16:23.608 --> 16:24.893
Do you mind?

16:25.026 --> 16:27.017
- Hey, kid,
what do you think?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.563
- Hot.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.812
- Exactly. Right.
You?

16:35.328 --> 16:36.488
- Duke...

16:39.165 --> 16:40.075
Go.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.039
- I'm off like a dirty shirt.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.750
- Man, you weren't kidding

16:45.880 --> 16:48.713
when you said your mom
was a note taker.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.377
But I'm still
not finding anything

16:50.510 --> 16:52.967
about heat or fire
in here.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.086
- Try this.

16:55.223 --> 16:57.259
They're stories Eleanor heard
about incidents

16:57.391 --> 16:59.256
back in the '70s—

16:59.393 --> 17:00.974
death and destruction
at some cabin

17:01.103 --> 17:03.936
on the border between
New Hampshire and Vermont.

17:04.065 --> 17:07.057
- And here
and upstate New York.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.103
Now, these people,

17:08.236 --> 17:09.897
they mentioned something
about a firebug,

17:10.029 --> 17:12.395
but I don't think
that means arsonist.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.397
- You ever heard
of pyrokinesis—

17:14.534 --> 17:16.616
people starting fires
with their minds?

17:16.744 --> 17:17.904
I've heard stories about it

17:18.037 --> 17:19.743
in some of the cultures
I've visited.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.249
- Thanks.
That's worth a start.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.078
[rock music playing]

17:28.214 --> 17:33.004
J‘J‘

17:33.135 --> 17:35.296
- Well...

17:35.429 --> 17:37.590
welcome
to the Grey Gull.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.429
- It's, uh, charming.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.265
I don't see any gulls.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.510
- No, they're, uh—

17:43.646 --> 17:45.227
they're not allowed inside.

17:45.356 --> 17:48.098
- Oh, of course.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.065
- Come on, let me, uh—

17:50.194 --> 17:52.105
let me show you around.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.899
Here's the bar.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.408
This is the deck.

17:56.534 --> 18:00.948
That's, um, pretty much it.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.069
Please.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.586
- So you're a smuggler?

18:13.426 --> 18:16.168
- Well...

18:16.304 --> 18:17.840
it's true...

18:17.972 --> 18:20.588
I've had several encounters

18:20.725 --> 18:23.637
with various
law enforcement entities,

18:23.769 --> 18:25.054
but I'm an importer.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.142
- Mm.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.230
Importing illegal goods?

18:29.358 --> 18:31.815
- Well, everything
is illegal somewhere.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.822
So enough about me.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.160
What about you?

18:43.289 --> 18:44.825
- What about me?

18:44.957 --> 18:49.496
- Well, for instance...

18:49.629 --> 18:51.540
why does Nathan Wuornos

18:51.672 --> 18:54.084
have a sketch artist
drawing your face?

18:54.216 --> 18:55.501
- He does?

18:55.635 --> 18:56.715
- Mm-hmm.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.335
- I got to go.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.054
- Vanessa,
I can probably help if—

19:02.183 --> 19:04.424
- [gasps]
- Vanessa?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.300
- [gasping]

19:06.437 --> 19:07.973
- Let me help.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.686
- Don't, don't.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.100
You can't.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.485
- Vanessa, look—

19:14.820 --> 19:16.776
- It's coming.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.078
- Is that her?

19:26.207 --> 19:28.698
- Yeah, the witnesses have been
collaborating on an image.

19:28.834 --> 19:33.373
- Hey, can you, uh,
move her part over?

19:33.506 --> 19:36.498
Yeah, and move it
more towards the middle.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.424
Okay, that's better.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.262
Yup, and her glasses,

19:44.392 --> 19:47.725
more rounded at the bottom.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.764
Good.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.979
- That's her.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.723
- Thank you.
You can go.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.975
- Thank you.

19:56.112 --> 19:59.024
- I spent a half an hour
with her and Duke yesterday.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.942
That's Vanessa Stanley.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.781
- She called 911
after Manning's car exploded.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.446
I've been trying
to reach her all day.

20:04.578 --> 20:05.829
But if you met with her
atnoon

20:05.955 --> 20:07.240
and then she blows up a car
at 4:00,

20:07.373 --> 20:08.738
it's quite a coincidence.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.581
- I was meeting with Vanessa
because she was at the scene

20:11.711 --> 20:15.920
of a very mysterious death
27 years ago.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.458
And suddenly
we have her at the scene

20:17.591 --> 20:19.422
of two other
mysterious deaths?

20:19.552 --> 20:23.136
- Hmm, suddenly it doesn't sound
like such a coincidence.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.505
- Let's go pick her up.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.565
- Police! Open up!

20:40.698 --> 20:41.608
Police!

20:41.741 --> 20:43.106
- I heard you
the first time.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.106
- Duke?

20:44.243 --> 20:45.904
- Hi, Audrey.
How are you?

20:46.036 --> 20:47.822
- Vanessa!
- She's not home.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.492
- Wait. Is she the babysitter
you were talking about?

20:50.624 --> 20:53.832
- I don't appreciate
the judginess.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.292
Come in.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.798
I came here looking for her,
and she was gone.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.178
And I found all this.

21:10.895 --> 21:11.975
- So you just let yourself in?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.605
- Yeah, call a cop.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.472
She came by the Gull earlier.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.644
We were talking and—

21:17.777 --> 21:20.189
- You saw the sketch.
You tipped her off.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.812
- You want to arrest me,
or you want to let me talk?

21:22.948 --> 21:24.529
- Vanessa, the Gull,
then what?

21:24.658 --> 21:26.273
- As I was saying,

21:26.410 --> 21:27.525
we were at the Gull.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.821
We were talking.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.196
Somehow she found out
about the sketch.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.368
I don't know.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.662
And then she freaked out,
all right?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.251
She took off.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.040
That was a few hours ago.

21:39.173 --> 21:42.006
She wouldn't answer my calls,
so I came here to check on her,

21:42.134 --> 21:44.170
and I found all this.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.010
I mean, it's—
it's nonsense.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.801
It's descriptions
of explosions and guns and...

21:51.560 --> 21:52.891
It's all pretty freaky.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.180
- It's kind of manic.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.894
- Yeah.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.682
Wait.

21:59.819 --> 22:00.979
Look at this.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.897
Those names
that are crossed off,

22:03.030 --> 22:05.191
that's the two people
that died yesterday.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.736
This a hit list?

22:07.868 --> 22:09.028
- A hit list?

22:09.161 --> 22:10.697
Vanessa?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.195
You did meet her, right?

22:12.331 --> 22:13.867
- Well...

22:13.999 --> 22:15.375
- You knew her, what,
27 years ago?

22:15.501 --> 22:16.957
Your babysitter.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.246
You know, people change.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.664
- You didn't.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.667
- Okay, Matt.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.631
Matt, next on the list.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.749
Ring any bells?

22:25.886 --> 22:29.049
- There was a Matt at the pool
when Xander died—

22:29.181 --> 22:30.796
Matt, uh, West.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.049
He's a student.
He was on my witness list.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.018
- All right, let's get to him
before she does.

23:00.671 --> 23:01.581
- Police!

23:01.714 --> 23:03.045
Let me see your hands.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.424
- Get out of the car...

23:07.553 --> 23:08.633
slowly.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.093
- Don't do this.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.928
- Vanessa,
don't do anything stupid.

23:12.057 --> 23:12.921
- You don't understand.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.264
There's going to be
an explosion.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.930
- Does that have anything
to do with this?

23:17.062 --> 23:18.268
- Yes. No!

23:18.397 --> 23:20.262
Look, there's only
a few minutes to save Matt.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.598
[groans]

23:22.735 --> 23:24.191
- Vanessa!
- Hey!

23:24.320 --> 23:26.185
- No, don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

23:26.322 --> 23:27.778
You got to stop it, Duke.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.649
There's a propane tank.
It's gonna explode.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.451
- So, Cheryl,

23:34.580 --> 23:37.447
messed up what happened
to Man-o-Manning, huh?

23:37.583 --> 23:40.791
- My spam filter's on, loser.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.160
- Rude much?

23:42.296 --> 23:45.003
- Stupid much?
Piss off, West.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.997
- That's Matt.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.422
- Hey, break it up!

23:51.388 --> 23:54.004
- The grill.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.132
Whoo.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.474
- Everyone!
- Everyone move!

23:57.603 --> 23:58.638
- Clear out!
- Move back!

23:58.771 --> 24:00.011
- Get back. Get back.
Get back.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.853
Go. Go. Go.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.597
- Ready?

24:08.447 --> 24:09.653
- What was that about?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.318
- Oh, great.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.987
We should get out of here.
Let's get out of here.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.948
[explosion]

24:32.096 --> 24:33.176
- Hey.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.512
Hey, you.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.723
You were at the pool
when Xander died.

24:37.851 --> 24:38.840
- So what?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.184
- Let's go.

24:42.690 --> 24:43.679
- How did you know?

24:43.816 --> 24:45.352
- I see things.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.897
I see the last things people see
before they die.

24:49.029 --> 24:52.362
They're just fragments.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.731
I try to stop them
from happening,

24:53.867 --> 24:56.859
but no matter what I try,
the people keep dying.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.362
- Do you think it was Brian?
- I don't know.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.534
I haven't seen him.

25:01.667 --> 25:06.161
I just—l feel him
out there.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.423
I'm just trying
to stop him.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.540
- Okay,
so what about the list?

25:10.676 --> 25:13.918
- A disaster is coming.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.636
All those people
are gonna die.

25:16.765 --> 25:20.349
I just haven't figured out
what happens to them.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.397
[gasping]

25:24.523 --> 25:25.763
- Are you okay?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.404
- I don't think it's Brian.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.822
- Why not?

25:39.955 --> 25:41.741
- Earlier this morning,

25:41.874 --> 25:44.832
I touched a mirror.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.576
I saw my own death.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.749
Nothing has changed
about the image.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.918
The disaster still comes...

25:53.093 --> 25:55.379
And I still die in it.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.606
- You looked
like you were in pain

26:09.735 --> 26:11.100
before that tank exploded.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.487
- The pain comes and goes.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.945
It's—it's worst
right before somebody dies.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.531
It started yesterday afternoon.
I was feeling sick.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.035
And Carlene came in
and found me,

26:19.161 --> 26:21.277
and she touched me.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.278
And I saw
what was gonna happen.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.530
[explosion]

26:24.666 --> 26:27.203
And it was the same thing
with Xander

26:27.336 --> 26:30.828
and—and all those people
at the bar yesterday.

26:30.964 --> 26:34.331
I saw so many of them
dying at the same time.

26:34.468 --> 26:37.175
- You know, you could've come
to us for help.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.805
- I wanted to.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.171
I even went
to the police station,

26:40.307 --> 26:43.845
but I was afraid that you
would assume I was to blame.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.683
- No, we would've listened
to you.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.303
- Yeah?

26:47.439 --> 26:49.054
And then what?

26:49.191 --> 26:50.556
Locked her up?

26:50.692 --> 26:54.230
Like Brian, the kid
you've got just in case?

26:54.363 --> 26:56.149
- God, it doesn't matter.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.361
It's fate.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.072
Right,
I can't change anything.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.941
All I have to do is watch.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.864
I can't change anything.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.157
- Hey, we just did,

27:05.290 --> 27:08.453
at the party just now.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.496
We can make our own fate.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.620
We can stop this.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.256
And we will.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.690
- I'm sorry.
We messed this all up.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.181
We couldn't make
much sense of it.

27:32.317 --> 27:35.150
- That's okay.
Neither could I.

27:35.279 --> 27:38.316
This—this is about
Phil Banks here.

27:38.448 --> 27:41.281
He's the lumber guy
at the hardware store.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.025
He's lying on the ground,

27:43.162 --> 27:45.027
or maybe it's a floor,

27:45.164 --> 27:46.995
and he's looking
under something,

27:47.124 --> 27:49.911
and the fire
comes rushing at him.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.374
- You describe it
very clearly.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.879
- Soldiers, guns...

27:53.005 --> 27:55.166
what, are the Canadians
finally invading?

27:55.299 --> 27:57.290
- Okay, you know what?
Here's one.

27:57.426 --> 28:01.419
"Man on fire
burning from inside."

28:01.555 --> 28:03.386
You think he's the cause
of all this?

28:03.515 --> 28:06.052
- Yes.
That, I'm sure of.

28:10.147 --> 28:13.480
Audrey, can I speak with you
for a moment...

28:13.609 --> 28:15.145
privately?

28:15.277 --> 28:17.814
- Yeah.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.533
- You came to see me
the other day

28:25.662 --> 28:27.402
because
of the Colorado Kid photo,

28:27.539 --> 28:30.246
and I told you
that I didn't remember anything,

28:30.375 --> 28:32.912
because I didn't.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.036
But it started
to come back to me.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.708
- You remember that morning?

28:36.840 --> 28:38.705
- I remember something.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.838
I remember that this
isn't the first time

28:41.970 --> 28:43.710
this has happened to me.

28:46.308 --> 28:47.388
I was there that day

28:47.517 --> 28:50.008
because I'd seen
how he was going to die.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.890
- Come on, you're not buying
into this fate stuff, are you?

28:56.026 --> 28:59.268
- What, so Duke
charts his own path?

28:59.404 --> 29:00.780
- You don't?

29:04.076 --> 29:05.566
- After you visited me,

29:05.702 --> 29:08.114
l was...

29:08.247 --> 29:09.407
upset

29:09.539 --> 29:12.747
and it just started
to come back to me.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.083
- Vanessa,
when troubled people get upset,

29:15.212 --> 29:17.749
the shock,

29:17.881 --> 29:21.169
it triggers
their affliction.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.541
I'm really sorry.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.134
I feel like this
is all my fault.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.629
lf—if I hadn't visited you,

29:26.765 --> 29:28.471
you wouldn't be suffering
like this.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.012
- God wouldn't have given me
this terrible gift

29:31.144 --> 29:33.305
for no reason at all.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.350
I'm supposed
to do something...

29:36.483 --> 29:38.849
to save people.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.318
There's always
a price for that.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.613
- [sighs]
Let's say a guy like me,

29:44.741 --> 29:45.856
who can't feel anything,

29:45.993 --> 29:48.530
meets a woman and discovers
he can feel her touch.

29:48.662 --> 29:50.744
That just—

29:50.872 --> 29:53.830
Seems like fate,
doesn't it?

29:53.959 --> 29:57.042
- But Jess left you anyways,

29:57.170 --> 29:59.297
which is sad,

29:59.423 --> 30:01.539
but it's not fate.

30:07.389 --> 30:11.132
- Do you want to hear
about my vision

30:11.268 --> 30:15.136
from that day,
the day the Colorado Kid died?

30:15.272 --> 30:17.183
- Yeah.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.307
Yeah,
if you can tell me, yeah.

30:19.443 --> 30:23.027
- There was a hand...

30:23.155 --> 30:25.646
coming right at me,

30:25.782 --> 30:27.738
at his face.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.953
It was a pale arm...

30:34.082 --> 30:36.414
a man's arm...

30:36.543 --> 30:40.127
with a tattoo of some kind

30:40.255 --> 30:42.166
inside the forearm.

30:44.634 --> 30:45.760
I'm sorry.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.298
That's—that's all I remember.

30:48.430 --> 30:49.636
- No, that's great.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.177
That's more than I had
five minutes ago.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.020
- I don't get this.

30:56.146 --> 30:58.182
All she can see
is a textured red wall.

30:58.315 --> 30:59.225
What is that?

30:59.358 --> 31:02.020
- Life is random.

31:02.152 --> 31:04.017
Now, we try
to convince ourselves

31:04.154 --> 31:08.443
that this little movie
we call life has a plot.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.281
But it's not a movie.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.867
- Yes, it is.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.031
That's exactly what it is.

31:17.167 --> 31:18.202
Parker!

31:18.335 --> 31:20.496
We got something!
Get in here!

31:24.049 --> 31:25.289
It's a movie.

31:25.425 --> 31:28.383
This whole thing, everything
takes place in a movie.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.924
- That's where the war images
come from.

31:31.056 --> 31:34.799
- But I think it's outdoors,
not in a theater.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.141
both:
Dockside Green.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.770
- What's Dockside Green?

31:37.896 --> 31:40.433
- Bunch of kids have been
screening movies there lately.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.227
- Yeah, they, uh—
they put up a big screen,

31:43.360 --> 31:44.941
charge a buck,
show movies.

31:45.070 --> 31:48.028
People bring picnic stuff,
blankets.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.533
- Okay, wait. Wait.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.650
Matt West, okay,
he's part of the group

31:52.786 --> 31:54.526
that show the movies, right?

31:54.663 --> 31:57.154
They let him in because he knows
how to run the equipment.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.871
- Matt West.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.127
He was at the school.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.368
He was at the pool.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.495
- And the backyard party.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.917
That's it.
He's our common thread.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.551
Great.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.963
We just saved a killer.

32:17.102 --> 32:20.094
[explosions and gunfire]

32:28.447 --> 32:31.154
- So now what,
chase everyone out?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.820
- No, I think the rain's
gonna do that for us.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.364
- Then we just got to find him
before everyone else leaves.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.487
- Yeah, I don't see him
up at the projector.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.490
- Let's split up.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.663
Duke, come with me.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.661
You're tall and loud.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.629
- That was almost
a compliment.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.751
Be careful.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.503
[gunfire and explosion]

32:54.639 --> 32:57.051
- Is what Nathan says
about Matt true?

32:57.184 --> 33:00.017
- Well, he's a troubled kid.
His temper gets the best of him.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.100
You know, I think he tries,

33:01.229 --> 33:02.435
but for every step forward
he takes,

33:02.564 --> 33:04.680
something makes him lose
his cool, and he self-destructs.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.352
- Great, a troubled misfit—
perfect.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.771
Excuse me, we need
to have you leave now.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.579
- Hey, Cheryl.

33:25.712 --> 33:28.249
You want to share my umbrella?
- Not interested.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.336
- But—

33:29.466 --> 33:32.879
- West, you are not invited
to attend my life,

33:33.011 --> 33:34.126
rain or shine.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.129
[laughs]

33:43.772 --> 33:45.353
- Got to hurry.
It's coming.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.393
- Okay, we need you
to go now.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.482
Pack up your things.
Go, please. Thank you.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.522
Can you please leave?
Thank you.

33:51.655 --> 33:54.397
[fire whooshing]

33:54.533 --> 33:56.899
- Go! Everybody go!

33:57.035 --> 33:59.367
- Matt West,
I'm a police officer.

33:59.496 --> 34:00.531
I need to talk to you.

34:00.664 --> 34:05.078
You need to come down
right now!

34:05.210 --> 34:06.620
- Let go of me!
Leave me alone!

34:06.753 --> 34:08.038
- [gasping]

34:10.882 --> 34:13.089
- You did that, Matt,
and you need to make it stop.

34:13.218 --> 34:14.253
- What are you talking about?

34:14.386 --> 34:16.593
- People have the ability
to do things,

34:16.721 --> 34:17.756
unusual things,

34:17.889 --> 34:19.925
and we think
that you can heat things up,

34:20.058 --> 34:21.423
catch them on fire.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.267
- The troubles?

34:24.396 --> 34:25.636
You mean I did that?

34:25.772 --> 34:27.103
- Yes, you did that.

34:27.232 --> 34:28.972
You blew up
the principal's car,

34:29.109 --> 34:31.350
and you killed Xander
in that pool.

34:31.486 --> 34:32.566
- This is awesome.

34:32.696 --> 34:35.108
- No, Matt,
you have a choice,

34:35.240 --> 34:36.275
all right?

34:36.408 --> 34:38.069
This is not awesome.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.361
This is murder.

34:39.494 --> 34:40.995
- Oh, yeah?

34:41.121 --> 34:42.611
Prove that in court.

34:42.747 --> 34:43.953
Leave me alone.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.118
- Ah!

34:50.672 --> 34:52.458
- I'm not gonna
let this happen.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.127
- Vanessa, no!
- Vanessa!

35:09.941 --> 35:12.398
- Vanessa, come on.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.938
- Matt, stop this.

35:18.074 --> 35:18.984
We will shoot.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.233
- No, you won't.

35:24.789 --> 35:25.824
- Mother!

35:25.957 --> 35:27.288
Nathan, put it down.
It's burning.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.036
- A gun's not really fair,
is it?

35:32.172 --> 35:35.380
That—that didn't—
that didn't hurt, did it?

35:35.508 --> 35:37.248
- Actually, no.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.250
But you are starting
to piss me off.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.672
- Nathan, stop.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.467
l think—l think I have
a way to—to take him down.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.091
Just hold on.

35:46.227 --> 35:47.512
- Oh, you're—

35:47.646 --> 35:49.261
you're—you're gonna try
to fight me?

35:49.397 --> 35:51.558
[laughs]
That'd be stupid!

35:51.691 --> 35:54.728
- Look at you,
Mr. Big Bad Guy now,

35:54.861 --> 35:57.352
talking smack to the cops
like he's all tough.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.901
"A gun isn't really fair,
is it?"

36:00.033 --> 36:02.695
Oh, you actually think
that we're afraid of you?

36:02.827 --> 36:05.318
- You should be.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.198
- [scoffs]
Oh, yeah, that?

36:09.334 --> 36:10.790
That's supposed
to scare us, right?

36:10.919 --> 36:13.126
'Cause you're all big
and powerful?

36:13.254 --> 36:15.540
[scoffs]
You know, whatever.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.414
Come on.

36:17.550 --> 36:20.633
I don't have time
for this lame-ass bad guy.

36:20.762 --> 36:21.797
- Hey!

36:21.930 --> 36:23.670
Hey, you can't walk away
from me!

36:23.807 --> 36:25.638
You don't go
till I say so!

36:25.767 --> 36:27.553
- You sure about this?
- Trust me.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.721
- Screw you!

36:28.853 --> 36:30.138
You can't talk to me
like that!

36:30.271 --> 36:32.728
I'll burn your ass!

36:32.857 --> 36:34.643
[yells]

36:46.037 --> 36:48.494
- He's gone.

36:48.623 --> 36:49.954
- I killed him?

36:50.083 --> 36:52.039
- No.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.580
You saved everyone else.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.214
- Hey.

37:00.343 --> 37:01.924
Hey, you hear that?

37:02.053 --> 37:03.793
[sirens wailing]

37:03.930 --> 37:07.468
They're coming for you.
You're gonna be just fine.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.056
- [weakly]
I'm not.

37:11.271 --> 37:14.434
It's—it's okay.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.852
I don't want to—

37:16.985 --> 37:20.352
I don't want to live
with this gift.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.865
- You don't get
to just give up.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.991
There is no fate.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.989
- Yeah, Duke, there is.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.366
Do you want to know what I—

37:34.502 --> 37:37.915
what I saw about you?

38:21.174 --> 38:23.039
- This is all my fault.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.167
- You can't blame yourself.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.340
- Vanessa is dead because
I triggered her affliction.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.179
- And all those people
are alive.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.765
- Yeah, but how did we know that
they weren't gonna die anyway?

38:32.894 --> 38:34.634
- You can go crazy
trying to explain fate,

38:34.771 --> 38:38.138
looking for the secret reasons
why things happen—

38:38.274 --> 38:40.481
waste of time.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.816
You never know
if you're right.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.074
Screw fate.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.165
- Agreed.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.677
- I'm sorry about Vanessa.

39:15.562 --> 39:16.893
- [sighs]

39:19.065 --> 39:20.726
- What did she tell you?

39:20.859 --> 39:25.068
- Oh, well, she told me

39:25.196 --> 39:28.279
what every man
secretly wants to know—

39:28.408 --> 39:31.366
how he is going to die.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.904
Fantastic, right?

39:34.664 --> 39:36.905
Except she couldn't help
with the when.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.497
The how, yes, but the when...

39:38.626 --> 39:39.706
[clicks tongue]

39:39.836 --> 39:41.542
Not so much.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.793
- How do you die?

39:49.929 --> 39:51.760
- [chuckles]

39:51.890 --> 39:55.599
Well, apparently,

39:55.727 --> 39:57.592
some guy with a tattoo

39:57.729 --> 40:00.266
of a maze
with four little people

40:00.398 --> 40:02.354
at each of the compass points

40:02.483 --> 40:06.146
grabs my face with his hand.

40:06.279 --> 40:07.689
- Wait a second.

40:07.822 --> 40:10.985
Vanessa,
she had a vision

40:11.117 --> 40:12.948
of the Colorado Kid
before he died,

40:13.077 --> 40:14.817
and it was
of this man's hand,

40:14.954 --> 40:19.573
and it was coming
towards him.

40:22.295 --> 40:24.160
- It was the same guy, right?
Same tattoo?

40:24.297 --> 40:26.037
- Wait a minute.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.248
Like this?

40:35.975 --> 40:37.966
- How did you know
what that looks like?

40:38.102 --> 40:40.388
- We found it on a body
about a month ago.

40:40.521 --> 40:44.309
- Well, if he's dead,
then he can't kill me, right?

40:49.781 --> 40:52.443
What?

40:52.575 --> 40:54.236
What, there's more
than one guy out there

40:54.369 --> 40:55.734
with the same tattoo?

40:55.870 --> 40:59.112
- We know of at least one,
but there could be more.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.168
- Well, then that's too bad
for them,

41:13.304 --> 41:15.295
because I'm gonna
find them first.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.299
[chuckles]

41:24.107 --> 41:26.644
Looks like
we're on the same team.
