Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:09.893 --> 00:11.895
(tape rewinding)

00:11.895 --> 00:13.396
(beeping)

00:13.396 --> 00:14.898
Hi, Sam, this is Carla.

00:14.898 --> 00:16.900
I'll be in a little late today.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.402
Eddie's really down
about his losing streak,

00:19.903 --> 00:21.404
and I want to cheer him up.

00:21.404 --> 00:23.406
It may take six or seven hours.

00:23.406 --> 00:25.408
You know hockey players. Bye.

00:25.408 --> 00:26.409
(beeping)

00:26.409 --> 00:28.411
DIANE: Hi, Sam, it's me.

00:28.411 --> 00:31.414
I'm on a little break from the trial.

00:31.414 --> 00:35.418
We had some of the most
fascinating testimony today.

00:35.418 --> 00:38.421
Of course, I'm not at
liberty to discuss it.

00:38.421 --> 00:40.924
Suffice it to say...

00:40.924 --> 00:44.544
(tape fast-forwarding)

00:44.544 --> 00:48.548
...and the defendant had the
unmitigated gall to get...

00:48.548 --> 00:51.017
Oh, uh, they're calling us back in.

00:51.017 --> 00:53.019
I have to go. Love you. Bye.

00:53.019 --> 00:54.521
(beeping)

00:55.021 --> 00:55.822
Uh, this is Woody.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.524
Sam, uh, I got home tonight

00:57.524 --> 00:59.526
and remembered Diane
called after you left

00:59.526 --> 01:01.528
and wanted me to give you a message.

01:01.528 --> 01:04.280
I love you. Bye.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.699
(beeping)

01:06.699 --> 01:08.234
Uh, Sam, this is Woody again.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.236
That message
I just left--

01:10.236 --> 01:13.156
you understand it was Diane
saying I love you, not me.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.125
All right, bye.

01:15.125 --> 01:16.626
(beeping)

01:16.626 --> 01:18.628
This is Woody again.

01:18.628 --> 01:22.332
Uh, don't misunderstand
me, I really like you a lot.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.136
(beeping)

01:26.136 --> 01:27.554
This is Woody again.

01:27.554 --> 01:30.390
Uh, I've been thinking it over, Sam.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.809
I do love you.

01:37.230 --> 01:41.101
(piano plays)

01:41.101 --> 01:43.570
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:43.570 --> 01:46.573
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:46.573 --> 01:49.576
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:49.576 --> 01:53.079
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:53.079 --> 01:58.618
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:58.618 --> 02:00.620
? Sometimes you want to go ?

02:00.620 --> 02:06.126
? Where everybody knows your name ?

02:06.126 --> 02:10.630
? And they're always glad you came ?

02:10.630 --> 02:13.133
? You want to be where you can see ?

02:13.133 --> 02:16.136
? Our troubles are all the same ?

02:16.136 --> 02:21.141
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.643
? You want to go where people know ?

02:23.643 --> 02:26.146
? People are all the same ?

02:26.146 --> 02:30.150
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:47.300 --> 02:50.086
Hey, uh, Normie?

02:50.086 --> 02:52.088
Are you going to do my
taxes again this year?

02:52.088 --> 02:53.590
Sure thing, bud.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.592
Yeah, boy, I'm going to need some help

02:55.592 --> 02:58.094
shuffling through these
new tax laws, I'll tell you.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.013
What new tax laws?

03:04.517 --> 03:07.770
Maybe, uh, maybe I'll just
short-form it this year.

03:10.073 --> 03:13.576
See there's a little more
Eddie LeBec trade talk here.

03:13.576 --> 03:14.944
CLIFF: Oh, yeah?

03:14.944 --> 03:16.196
Oh, terrific.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.199
Uh, Bruins are playing
Gretzky at Edmonton tonight.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.084
Boy, another chance to see Eddie

03:21.084 --> 03:22.835
"Come on in and bring your puck" LeBec.

03:22.835 --> 03:23.836
(chuckling): Yeah.

03:23.836 --> 03:24.837
Boy, I tell you, that zuke

03:24.837 --> 03:27.207
is a disgrace to his
teammates and this fair city.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.341
Come on, give him a break.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.176
Well, Sammy, it's not
like we're not for the guy.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.178
I mean, especially with
Carla going out with him.

03:32.178 --> 03:34.681
But, you know, the guy's in
a major slump, let's face it.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.933
CLIFF: Hey, I can tell you an
interesting thing about slumps, too.

03:36.933 --> 03:39.852
Uh, statistics show that they can
be grouped into four categories.

03:39.852 --> 03:40.853
Yeah? Yeah, that's right.

03:40.853 --> 03:44.607
Uh, 65 percent physical,
17 percent emotional,

03:44.607 --> 03:49.946
yeah, 15 percent psychological
and, uh, three percent dental.

03:50.446 --> 03:51.447
Cliffie, you know something, man?

03:51.447 --> 03:52.899
You're a walking encyclopedia.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.400
Oh, thank you, Normie.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.903
Unfortunately, you're also
a talking encyclopedia.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.911
MAN: Motions, recess, motions, recess.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.413
When is this thing going to end?

04:07.413 --> 04:11.417
Two weeks, and the wife hasn't
even taken the stand yet.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.504
Sorry. I missed a couple
words of testimony.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.005
I wanted to go back and double-check it

04:16.005 --> 04:17.390
with the court reporter.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.676
Why do you keep your own
record of the testimony?

04:19.676 --> 04:21.928
They write down everything that's said.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.647
They don't write down emotions...

04:25.932 --> 04:29.736
...attitudes, telling facial glances.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.654
Study my face.

04:31.654 --> 04:34.157
What am I thinking?

04:37.660 --> 04:40.029
As the foreman of your jury,

04:40.029 --> 04:41.281
I feel

04:41.281 --> 04:43.032
that it is my duty

04:43.032 --> 04:46.536
to record each shred of evidence

04:46.536 --> 04:48.538
to give us every kernel of information

04:48.538 --> 04:52.041
so that we can make the
thoughtful and correct decision.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.793
WOMAN: Well, I've already

04:53.793 --> 04:54.627
made my decision.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.129
I think he's innocent.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.096
Yes. Me, too.

04:57.096 --> 05:00.099
Well, why don't we
just tell the judge that

05:00.099 --> 05:01.100
and go home?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.101
(everyone agreeing)

05:02.101 --> 05:03.102
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

05:03.102 --> 05:06.105
How can you possibly think that?

05:06.105 --> 05:08.107
I believed his testimony.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.809
Seems like a good guy.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.061
And he was impeccably dressed.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.864
I can't believe that I'm hearing this.

05:14.864 --> 05:17.734
These are your grounds for acquittal?

05:17.734 --> 05:21.988
Well, pardon me my objectivity,
but I don't happen to agree.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.406
He did it!

05:23.406 --> 05:25.408
I'm sure of it.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.660
I can tell just by looking at him.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.829
Oh, yeah? Yes.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.631
I was in a very similar

05:31.631 --> 05:34.083
situation to the wife in that my fiancÃ©

05:34.083 --> 05:36.586
has the same disarming brand of charm.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.587
Are you saying

05:37.587 --> 05:41.090
that you're about to marry a murderer?

05:41.090 --> 05:42.592
MAN: No, don't stop her.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.977
Let her do it.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.149
Ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha!

05:51.567 --> 05:53.069
Laugh if you will.

05:53.069 --> 05:56.572
I'm not fooled by Mr. Grand,
and neither should you be.

05:58.574 --> 05:59.575
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:00.076 --> 06:01.577
the judge would like you
back in the courtroom.

06:01.577 --> 06:02.578
WOMAN: What's going on?

06:02.578 --> 06:04.080
Well, just between us,

06:04.080 --> 06:06.082
Mrs. Grand is dropping the charges.

06:06.082 --> 06:07.583
Dropping charges?

06:07.583 --> 06:09.085
Why?

06:09.085 --> 06:11.087
She realized she still
loves her husband.

06:11.087 --> 06:12.088
Excuse me.

06:12.088 --> 06:13.589
Would it be possible

06:13.589 --> 06:15.091
for me to talk with Mrs. Grand?

06:15.091 --> 06:16.592
Are you serious?

06:16.592 --> 06:17.593
It's over.

06:17.593 --> 06:19.595
Oh, I am so happy for him.

06:19.595 --> 06:21.097
MAN: I'm happy for us.

06:21.097 --> 06:23.599
No more jury duty.

06:23.599 --> 06:26.102
Oh, where are you guys going afterward?

06:30.973 --> 06:32.892
I tell you, the guy's a bum!

06:32.892 --> 06:35.862
Sammy, two, uh, drafts and a Manhattan.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.363
And who's a bum?

06:37.363 --> 06:39.899
Eddie. Fisher. Eddie Fisher.

06:39.899 --> 06:43.903
The guy hasn't had a
hit record in years.

06:43.903 --> 06:47.373
Well, you better be talking
about him and not my Eddie.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.741
Are you worried about the game tonight?

06:48.741 --> 06:50.626
Of course I'm worried about it.

06:50.626 --> 06:51.627
I know Eddie's had

06:51.627 --> 06:54.580
a couple of bad games. Seven.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.582
Nine.

06:56.582 --> 07:00.586
Seven. I've never been
very good with numbers.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.388
CARLA: Yeah, well,

07:02.388 --> 07:05.258
I got a really good feeling
about tonight's game, you know?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.260
The weather's cleared, it's a full moon,

07:07.260 --> 07:10.263
and it's an even-numbered
day in an even-numbered month.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.265
He'll turn it around
tonight, you'll see.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.767
Oh, I think you're right.
Oh, yeah, absolutely, Carla.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.152
There you go. Absolutely.

07:16.152 --> 07:17.937
Hey, uh, I don't know if you guys

07:17.937 --> 07:19.439
have the same feeling I do,

07:19.439 --> 07:22.442
but I think it is just
more than a coincidence

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
that Eddie LeBec's, uh, bad run started

07:24.444 --> 07:25.945
when he began dating Carla.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.447
I say she's a jinx.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.449
Oh, come on; hey, don't say that.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.835
I mean, Carla's finally found
someone she really likes.

07:32.835 --> 07:34.587
But what else could it possibly be, Sam?

07:34.587 --> 07:35.588
Aw, it's ridiculous.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.089
I-I don't believe in that.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.591
Yeah, hey, Frasier, come here.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.593
Listen, tell these guys, will you,

07:40.593 --> 07:42.595
that there's nothing to the idea

07:42.595 --> 07:44.964
that Carla might be jinxing Eddie.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.215
Well, Sam, technically,

07:46.215 --> 07:48.718
there is no such thing
as a jinx, unless...

07:48.718 --> 07:51.220
someone thinks there is.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.605
Now, we know that Eddie's
very superstitious.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.023
If he believes that Carla's a jinx,

07:54.023 --> 07:56.392
I'm afraid it becomes a self
- fulfilling prophecy.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.145
All right, so Carla's a jinx.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.147
What are we going to do about it?

08:01.147 --> 08:03.649
Well, I don't know about
the rest of you guys,

08:03.649 --> 08:05.651
but I am not going to
let that woman kiss me.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.153
Yeah, right.

08:07.153 --> 08:11.157
Like there's a real danger
of that happening. Right.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.042
Hello, everyone.

08:13.042 --> 08:14.460
Oh, hello.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.462
Well, Sam, you'll be happy to know

08:16.462 --> 08:18.965
that you have me back full-time now.

08:18.965 --> 08:19.966
Oh.

08:19.966 --> 08:21.467
The trial is over.

08:21.467 --> 08:22.335
Well, good. Who won?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.720
Certainly not justice.

08:24.720 --> 08:29.091
I'm afraid the wife
decided to drop all charges.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.594
But I say the husband is a con artist

08:31.594 --> 08:34.597
who somehow managed to
convince that naive woman

08:34.597 --> 08:35.982
that he loves her.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.433
How can a man

08:38.433 --> 08:40.937
tell a woman that he loves her

08:40.937 --> 08:42.938
and yet try to kill her?

08:42.938 --> 08:44.941
I can see it. I can see it.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.444
Sammy, uh, could you,
uh, step down to my office

08:48.444 --> 08:49.829
for one second, please?

08:51.614 --> 08:52.615
Listen, uh, we were thinking

08:52.615 --> 08:54.116
maybe someone's got to tell Carla

08:54.116 --> 08:55.501
that she's jinxing Eddie.

08:55.501 --> 08:58.754
And what suicidal idiot did
you have in mind to do that?

08:58.754 --> 09:00.790
You know, your name kept
coming up in the discussion...

09:00.790 --> 09:02.458
No, no, no, no, no...

09:02.458 --> 09:03.259
Come on, Sammy.

09:03.259 --> 09:04.760
Look, it's just for all us guys

09:04.760 --> 09:06.262
whose lives are so damn shallow

09:06.262 --> 09:08.764
that we depend upon the success
of our local sports teams

09:08.764 --> 09:10.766
to give us a little
identity around here.

09:10.766 --> 09:12.768
Am I right? Huh? No, no, no, no way.

09:12.768 --> 09:14.270
Listen, if you want to do this,

09:14.270 --> 09:16.272
then we'll do it fair and square.

09:16.272 --> 09:17.773
We'll draw straws. Don't look.

09:17.773 --> 09:19.275
CLIFF: Oh, that's fair, Normie.

09:19.275 --> 09:22.278
Now, I want the person who
has to tell Carla to know

09:22.278 --> 09:26.148
that there's a choir job
waiting for them in Vienna.

09:26.148 --> 09:29.535
Sorry, Norm.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.537
Well, on the upside, Normie,

09:31.537 --> 09:35.041
you're in for some great strudel.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.042
Oh, damn.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.544
I've never been to Europe.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.548
Listen, uh... Carla,

09:42.548 --> 09:43.799
uh...

09:43.799 --> 09:46.085
a few of the guys and
I have been thinking.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.587
Now, this probably has, like,

09:47.587 --> 09:49.589
absolutely nothing to do with anything,

09:49.589 --> 09:52.341
but, uh... You know, Norm,

09:52.341 --> 09:55.144
I've been thinking about Eddie

09:55.144 --> 09:57.647
and what's happened to his
game and all that, and...

09:57.647 --> 10:02.652
do you think it's possible
that I could be jinxing him?

10:05.021 --> 10:06.906
You? Jinxing Eddie?

10:07.907 --> 10:09.909
That's silly. No way!

10:09.909 --> 10:11.410
(chuckling): No.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.778
(whispering): Thank you, God.

10:14.330 --> 10:15.615
Sam?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.116
Yeah?

10:17.617 --> 10:18.618
You don't think it's possible

10:18.618 --> 10:20.620
that I'm jinxing Eddie, do you?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.621
No.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.122
Me, either.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.124
It's got to be something else.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.125
And when he comes here,

10:26.125 --> 10:28.127
we're going to figure it out together.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.012
You really like the guy, don't you?

10:30.012 --> 10:32.765
I am this close to falling hard for him.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.133
Oh, boy.

10:36.018 --> 10:37.770
Hey, Eddie!

10:37.770 --> 10:38.771
Oh... CARLA: Hey, Eddie!

10:38.771 --> 10:39.772
Hi.

10:39.772 --> 10:40.723
How's it going?

10:40.723 --> 10:43.225
Well, after my last game,

10:43.225 --> 10:46.729
a fan sent me some new equipment.

10:46.729 --> 10:49.115
Dark glasses and a white cane.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.033
Oh, you're just having a slump.

10:51.033 --> 10:52.535
You'll get out of it.

10:52.535 --> 10:53.903
I don't know, Sam.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.237
I've tried everything.

10:55.237 --> 10:59.241
I've been watching game
films, taking extra practice.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.743
I don't know what to do.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.745
What did you used to do
to break out of slumps

11:02.745 --> 11:03.746
when you were pitching, Sam?

11:03.746 --> 11:06.749
Me? Well, I, uh, drank
myself into a coma.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.135
Did it work?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.924
Hey, Eddie. Hey, hey, Carla.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.426
Tonight's your night; I know it.

11:17.426 --> 11:19.428
Yeah, well, facing Gretzky, eh?

11:19.428 --> 11:20.429
Hey, forget him.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.431
You carrying that lucky clove

11:22.431 --> 11:23.933
of garlic I gave you? Yeah.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.935
Yes, he is.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.437
I don't know, Carla.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.439
I'm starting to get that choking feeling

11:30.439 --> 11:31.440
I usually get a day or two

11:31.440 --> 11:33.442
before they send me down to the minors.

11:33.442 --> 11:34.944
No, no, no, come on!

11:34.944 --> 11:36.445
I don't want to hear any of that.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.447
There's got to be an
explanation for this,

11:38.447 --> 11:40.449
and we're going to
figure it out right now.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.334
Let's take it from the beginning, okay?

11:42.334 --> 11:44.670
When was the last time you won?

11:44.670 --> 11:45.671
Well, let's see.

11:45.671 --> 11:48.674
I think that would be
the Canadiens game, eh?

11:48.674 --> 11:51.177
Um, that's right, because I remember

11:51.177 --> 11:53.179
that's the night we met.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.681
Yeah... could've been
somewhere around then.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.050
Yeah, so, um, when did things

11:58.050 --> 11:59.852
start going bad?

11:59.852 --> 12:01.854
Well, I guess that
would be the next game.

12:01.854 --> 12:06.358
Right. All right, now think really hard.

12:06.358 --> 12:10.362
Have you been doing anything
different during that time--

12:10.362 --> 12:11.864
um, eating different foods,

12:11.864 --> 12:13.866
taking a different route to the Garden,

12:13.866 --> 12:15.367
buying different magazines?

12:15.367 --> 12:17.369
I mean, anything, anything at all?

12:17.369 --> 12:18.871
No, no, nothing at all.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.372
I... I've been living my life

12:20.372 --> 12:22.875
the same way as I've always lived it.

12:22.875 --> 12:23.876
Except for one thing.

12:32.635 --> 12:34.920
Eddie, do me a favor.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.255
Yeah, Carla.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.473
Beat it.

12:37.473 --> 12:39.258
What's the problem?

12:39.258 --> 12:43.512
The problem is... we
just don't work anymore.

12:43.512 --> 12:44.814
It's been a lot of grins,

12:44.814 --> 12:47.183
but we both knew it wasn't
going to last forever.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.984
So, it's time for you
to hit the pavement.

12:48.984 --> 12:50.352
Well, hey, I... I don't get it.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.354
I thought things were
going great for us.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.857
Yeah, well, they were,
but they're not anymore,

12:54.857 --> 12:57.860
and I just don't want to
talk about it, so shove off!

12:57.860 --> 12:59.862
Okay.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.747
Whatever you say.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.536
I'll see you around, I guess.

13:12.591 --> 13:14.093
Pretty gutsy thing to do.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.545
Gutsy? Nothin'.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.048
I'm going to prove to all you yutzes

13:19.048 --> 13:22.051
and to myself that I'm no jinx.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.554
If Eddie loses tonight,
it's not my fault.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.555
You'll see.

13:26.555 --> 13:30.943
He can stink just as bad
without me as he stunk with me.

13:34.113 --> 13:39.318
It's not Romeo and Juliet,
but it has a certain charm.

13:42.421 --> 13:44.940
TV ANNOUNCER: Time running
out in the third period.

13:44.940 --> 13:46.659
It's still one-nothing,
favor of the Boston Bruins.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.161
Here's Gretzky across the
Boston line, taps in front.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.663
Rolling save by Eddie LeBec!

13:50.663 --> 13:52.531
(cheering) He went
sprawling to the front side

13:52.531 --> 13:53.782
and kicked it out with his right hand.

13:53.782 --> 13:55.618
Sammy, two beers and a vodka rocks.

13:55.618 --> 13:57.119
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

13:57.119 --> 13:58.621
Come on, is my order up yet?

13:58.621 --> 14:00.623
What? Oh, c-come on, give me a second.

14:00.623 --> 14:02.625
Whoa-ho-ho-ho! There's
people here, Sammy?

14:02.625 --> 14:04.126
Are you running a bar
or you just watching

14:04.627 --> 14:05.527
some stupid hockey game?

14:05.628 --> 14:07.129
All right, all right, all right.

14:07.129 --> 14:09.131
You want to know what the score is?

14:09.131 --> 14:10.599
Is Boston leading?

14:10.599 --> 14:12.101
Yeah.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.469
Did the Oilers score on Eddie?

14:13.469 --> 14:14.470
No.

14:14.470 --> 14:15.971
I'm not interested.

14:15.971 --> 14:17.273
Whoa, look out, whoa!

14:17.273 --> 14:18.557
Penalty?!

14:18.557 --> 14:20.059
He calls that slashing?

14:20.059 --> 14:20.943
Well, Frasier,

14:20.943 --> 14:22.611
he nearly cut Curry in half there.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.396
Oh, ticky-tack. It's a wussy call.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.398
Let the guys play the game.

14:29.735 --> 14:31.737
Good eve...

14:32.738 --> 14:37.209
Aren't you... Bill and Sherry Grand?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.577
That's right.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.914
(laughs): Oh...

14:41.914 --> 14:43.916
What an incredible coincidence.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.802
I was the foreman of
the jury at your trial.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.004
Oh, yeah, the one with the notebook.

14:49.004 --> 14:50.389
Oh, you noticed?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.390
It was hard not to.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.676
I was keeping track of the testimony.

14:53.676 --> 14:54.927
Diane Chambers. Hello.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.929
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.431
Why weren't you at the party?

14:59.431 --> 15:00.933
Party? What party?

15:00.933 --> 15:02.818
The party the jury threw for me.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.653
I'm surprised they
would've had it without you.

15:04.653 --> 15:08.023
You seem so... attractive
and intelligent.

15:08.023 --> 15:11.327
Yes, well, those qualities
confuse some people.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.329
Besides, I had to work.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.830
But who cares about me?

15:14.830 --> 15:17.700
The important thing is you two
are back together again, huh?

15:17.700 --> 15:20.452
Thank you. Could we maybe order?

15:20.452 --> 15:21.453
(laughs)

15:21.453 --> 15:23.455
I'd like a glass of white wine.

15:23.455 --> 15:24.340
Wine.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.674
What-what would you like?

15:25.674 --> 15:26.675
I'll have a Bloody Mary.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.093
(throaty laugh)

15:33.599 --> 15:35.100
Excuse me.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.603
I know this is very forward of me,

15:37.603 --> 15:39.972
but the last time I saw you in court,

15:39.972 --> 15:41.473
you were ranting and raving,

15:41.473 --> 15:42.975
calling this man a wife murderer.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.477
It's... very shocking for me

15:45.978 --> 15:48.480
to see you with him now, so blissful.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.951
I guess I just realized
how much I love him.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.237
I really admire your...
your trust, your conviction.

15:55.237 --> 15:56.739
If you don't mind a
little friendly advice,

15:56.739 --> 15:58.741
I'd sleep with one eye open.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.745
I'll get the drinks.

16:02.745 --> 16:04.747
It's a good thing you
dropped the charges.

16:04.747 --> 16:08.250
I'd hate to have my fate in her hands.

16:08.250 --> 16:09.752
Bill...

16:09.752 --> 16:13.806
why did you have the
power saw in the kitchen?

16:13.806 --> 16:17.426
(cheering)

16:17.426 --> 16:18.761
Sam... Hit 'em!

16:18.761 --> 16:22.264
A white wine and a... Bloody Mary.

16:22.264 --> 16:25.267
Oh... human nature.

16:25.267 --> 16:26.769
What?! Oh...

16:26.769 --> 16:28.771
that couple over there.

16:28.771 --> 16:29.772
They're the Grands.

16:30.272 --> 16:31.774
You remember.

16:31.774 --> 16:35.160
The case on which I
was foreman of the jury?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.663
Oh, right, right, right,
the, uh, power saw.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.531
DIANE: I know. You don't trust me?

16:39.531 --> 16:40.833
Oh, I tell you, it never ceases

16:40.833 --> 16:44.253
to amaze me how some
people can be so ignorant

16:44.253 --> 16:46.755
of what is obvious to
the rest of the world.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.257
DIANE: Well, I guess there's something

16:48.257 --> 16:49.758
to be said for forgiveness.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.712
In fact, in this rather
jaded day and age,

16:53.712 --> 16:57.633
it's nice to know that amor vincit omnia.

16:57.633 --> 16:58.634
Hmm?

16:58.634 --> 17:00.135
Love conquers all.

17:00.135 --> 17:01.136
Mm.

17:01.136 --> 17:03.639
And I, for one, shall
not stand in its way.

17:03.639 --> 17:05.641
You know, Sam, I'm going
to pay for this round.

17:05.641 --> 17:06.642
Well, you better hurry.

17:06.642 --> 17:08.143
It looks like he's about to fire up

17:08.143 --> 17:09.144
the old Black & Decker there.

17:09.144 --> 17:11.030
(indistinct arguing)

17:13.398 --> 17:14.900
Oh, don't touch me!

17:14.900 --> 17:15.901
Stay away from me!

17:15.901 --> 17:17.286
Just stay away from me!

17:17.286 --> 17:19.238
What happened?

17:19.238 --> 17:20.705
What happened?

17:20.705 --> 17:24.076
Why don't you check your
stupid little notebook?!

17:26.045 --> 17:28.547
So... the system works after all.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.084
TV ANNOUNCER: Back the Oilers
go, back behind the net.

17:32.084 --> 17:34.086
Mark Muskee starting
out for the center ice.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.587
Oilers trailing, one-nothing.

17:35.587 --> 17:36.588
They fool the goal tender.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.474
Pressure really on
Eddie LeBec right now.

17:38.474 --> 17:42.761
Please screw up, please
screw up, please screw up.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.763
Sam, I don't understand.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.265
Why does Carla want Eddie to screw up?

17:46.265 --> 17:47.266
(sighs)

17:47.266 --> 17:49.768
Well, you see, if Eddie
loses, then Carla wins,

17:49.768 --> 17:51.770
because it proves
she's no longer a jinx.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.273
But if he wins, then Carla loses,

17:54.273 --> 17:56.275
'cause it reinforces the jinx theory.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.778
Ah, the old "boy loses, girl wins,

17:59.778 --> 18:02.781
boy wins, girl loses"
jinx reinforcement theory.

18:02.781 --> 18:06.251
If I've seen it once, I've seen it...

18:08.704 --> 18:10.122
TV ANNOUNCER: Still
one-nothing, Boston Bruins lead.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.090
Time running out on the game.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.208
Oilers bring it out to center ice.

18:13.208 --> 18:16.211
Here's Mark Messier across the
red line into the Bruins' zone.

18:16.211 --> 18:18.213
Gives it down the left
side to Glenn Anderson,

18:18.213 --> 18:19.214
cutting in in
front-- he shoots!

18:19.214 --> 18:21.016
And it's saved by Eddie LeBec!

18:21.016 --> 18:21.800
Point-blank range.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.802
Eddie LeBec with a great save,

18:23.802 --> 18:27.306
wins the game for the
Boston Bruins. Damn!

18:33.812 --> 18:34.813
Hey, Sam.

18:34.813 --> 18:35.814
Hey.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.065
See the game tonight?

18:37.065 --> 18:38.400
I sure did. Congratulations.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.401
Thanks. Yeah.

18:39.401 --> 18:40.903
It felt great. (chuckles)

18:40.903 --> 18:41.904
Did you ever have one of those nights

18:41.904 --> 18:43.405
you just knew you could do no wrong?

18:43.405 --> 18:45.407
Oh, yeah, all the time.

18:45.908 --> 18:47.910
Well, twice.

18:50.412 --> 18:51.914
There you go. Thanks.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.138
What are you doing here?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.640
Just came by for a drink.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.008
That okay?

19:03.008 --> 19:04.843
Free country.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.348
You know...

19:09.348 --> 19:11.850
Carla, after the game tonight, I...

19:11.850 --> 19:14.853
I figured out why you dumped me.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.855
I guess I'm a little slow on the uptake

19:16.855 --> 19:19.858
since I've taken so many on the melon.

19:19.858 --> 19:23.829
I, uh...

19:23.829 --> 19:27.332
I guess you wanted to see if
you were causin' my slump, eh?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.334
Yeah, and guess what?

19:30.836 --> 19:33.589
Well, it doesn't seem fair
that the girl that means

19:33.589 --> 19:35.874
more to me than anybody else ever has,

19:35.874 --> 19:38.877
you know, turns out to be a...

19:38.877 --> 19:41.380
turns out, you know... Say it: a jinx.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.266
A hex, a whammy, a voodoo, a curse.

19:45.133 --> 19:48.136
What am I going to do?

19:50.138 --> 19:52.024
You're not going to do anything.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.275
I'm not going to be responsible

19:53.275 --> 19:56.278
for the Bruins missing the playoffs

19:56.278 --> 19:59.648
or for your career
going down the toilet.

20:10.242 --> 20:11.743
Hey, Eddie.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.245
Yeah.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.714
Knock 'em dead.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.466
Yeah.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.251
And watch out for those wrist shots

20:19.251 --> 20:21.753
low in the corner on your stick side.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.639
Okay, you got it.

20:23.639 --> 20:24.923
Oh.

20:25.924 --> 20:29.177
I wanted you to have this.

20:29.177 --> 20:30.512
What is it?

20:30.512 --> 20:32.014
It's a recording of our song.

20:32.014 --> 20:35.567
I thought... you know,
maybe sometime, you would...

20:35.567 --> 20:37.352
I don't know, maybe play it and...

20:37.352 --> 20:40.239
and, um, think of me...

20:40.239 --> 20:43.408
you know, think good stuff.

20:44.109 --> 20:45.577
I will.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.582
Okay.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.835
All right, I'll see you, Carla.

20:53.835 --> 20:54.670
Yeah. See you.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.171
You, too, Sam.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.515
Well...

21:07.799 --> 21:09.685
For a refreshing change,

21:09.685 --> 21:13.689
Carla Tortelli ends up without the guy.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.109
This shirt's drip-dry if
you want to give it a...

21:17.109 --> 21:18.110
No, no, come on.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.611
It's happened so many times,

21:19.611 --> 21:21.613
my tear ducts are all dried up.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.615
Why don't you go on home, Sam?

21:23.615 --> 21:25.617
Come on. I'll clean up here.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.618
Is that what you want?

21:26.618 --> 21:29.621
Yeah, yeah, I think I want
to be alone for awhile.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.124
Okay...

21:32.124 --> 21:33.125
but if you want someone to talk to,

21:33.625 --> 21:34.493
I'll be over at Diane's.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.163
So, you know, if you want
to call, just go ahead.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.632
Please call.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.920
Thanks, Sam. Good night.

22:11.613 --> 22:16.034
("O, Canada" intro played on pipe organ)

22:16.034 --> 22:20.372
MALE SINGER (on tape): ?
O, Canada, our home and ?

22:20.372 --> 22:23.675
(Carla joining in): ? ...native land ?

22:23.675 --> 22:26.878
? True patriot love ?

22:26.878 --> 22:30.849
(singer only): ? In
all thy sons command ?

22:30.849 --> 22:35.303
? With glowing hearts,
we see thee rise ?

22:35.303 --> 22:37.272
? The True North strong and free... ?

22:43.145 --> 22:45.647
Hey, Wood, what you working on?

22:45.647 --> 22:47.649
Cheers newsletter.

22:47.649 --> 22:49.651
Wood, Cheers doesn't have a newsletter.

22:51.653 --> 22:53.655
Wow, there's a scoop.

22:53.655 --> 22:55.157
I'll make that my lead story.

22:55.157 --> 22:57.159
Ah.

22:57.159 --> 22:58.660
Night, Wood.

22:58.660 --> 23:00.162
G'night.

23:00.162 --> 23:01.663
Say, Carla, you sure
you don't want to go

23:01.663 --> 23:02.664
to the game with me tonight?

23:02.664 --> 23:04.166
I'm really on a hot streak.

23:04.166 --> 23:05.667
You're tellin' me
you're on a hot streak.

23:05.667 --> 23:08.670
For the past few weeks,
you've been fantastic.

23:08.670 --> 23:10.672
Not bad on the ice, either.

23:11.673 --> 23:14.176
Hey, Eddie, do me a favor and beat it!

23:14.176 --> 23:15.060
What's the problem?

23:15.060 --> 23:16.928
Problem is we just don't work anymore.

23:16.928 --> 23:17.929
It's been a lot of grins,

23:17.929 --> 23:19.898
but we both knew it wasn't
going to last forever.

23:19.898 --> 23:20.899
I don't get it.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.651
I thought things were great between us.

23:22.651 --> 23:25.437
Well, they were, but they're
not anymore, so hit the bricks.

23:25.437 --> 23:26.438
All right, whatever you say.

23:26.438 --> 23:28.940
Say, I was in here a
couple of weeks ago.

23:28.940 --> 23:31.443
Didn't Carla and her
boyfriend break up then?

23:31.443 --> 23:32.327
Yeah.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.662
They do that before every game.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.164
It's kind of a ritual.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.666
Hey, Carla, that's it!

23:38.166 --> 23:40.502
We're finished! Through! Good-bye!

23:40.502 --> 23:41.453
Good-bye!

23:44.005 --> 23:47.375
Red Wings Thursday
night. See you then, eh?

23:50.045 --> 23:53.548
Superstitious little guy, but he's mine.
