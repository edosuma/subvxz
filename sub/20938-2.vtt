WEBVTT

00:02.820 --> 00:04.819
In 24 hours, we will land on Mars.

00:04.820 --> 00:07.619
- But we won't be the first.
- We were crossed by your competition?

00:07.620 --> 00:10.539
- Zillion is behind this mission.
- It doesn't make any sense.

00:10.540 --> 00:13.980
Earth hasn't heard from them,
except for one video.

00:16.540 --> 00:17.939
The ten months of travel have revealed

00:17.940 --> 00:20.060
serious neurosis in
several of the crew members.

00:21.780 --> 00:23.299
We now have a rescue mission.

00:23.300 --> 00:25.299
<i>The unhooking system seems to be failing.</i>

00:25.300 --> 00:27.300
- What are you doing?
- I'm going out.

00:33.980 --> 00:35.860
- We can't leave him.
- We have no choice.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.340
I can't reboot Irene.

00:49.940 --> 00:52.900
Without a life support system,
we'll all be dead in 24 hours.

00:53.700 --> 00:54.900
Welcome to Mars.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.900
Zillion changed the world.

01:15.220 --> 01:16.780
We changed the world.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.300
In the space of 15 years,

01:22.260 --> 01:23.860
we created more services

01:24.140 --> 01:26.460
than any other company in
the previous hundred.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.420
We made the impossible possible.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.740
I had a vision.

01:35.060 --> 01:38.500
A vision where each and every
person on this planet

01:39.420 --> 01:42.540
would be connected to each other
like never before.

01:43.740 --> 01:45.380
And that day has come.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.500
I forgot.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.180
Our future is now elsewhere.

02:02.060 --> 02:04.740
5 years ago when I created ZSpace,

02:05.260 --> 02:07.060
people laughed at me.

02:10.539 --> 02:12.460
They're not laughing anymore.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.660
Here is Z Explorer One.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.820
In a few months' time, this ship
will land on Mars.

02:24.780 --> 02:27.020
It's the result of innovation.

02:27.620 --> 02:31.380
A venture that Zillion
alone could accomplish.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.380
Space is set to become
a land of competition,

02:34.700 --> 02:37.580
and I promise you, we'll be first on Mars.

02:38.260 --> 02:39.900
The future is now.

02:41.020 --> 02:42.380
Are you with us?

03:00.700 --> 03:02.020
Can he hear us?

03:04.940 --> 03:06.300
How long does he have?

03:06.700 --> 03:08.060
Nobody knows.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.100
Zillion's best kept secret.

03:11.980 --> 03:13.420
But it's spreading fast.

03:13.820 --> 03:15.260
He's running out of time.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.299
I gave her something to
make her sleep for a while.

04:40.300 --> 04:43.779
She and Martin met when they entered
the Space program.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.780
Simon, you did the right thing.

04:46.300 --> 04:49.820
- So?
- We used way too much fuel.

04:50.780 --> 04:53.779
With what we have left we can't take off
and go back into orbit.

04:53.780 --> 04:56.539
- We'll find a way later.
- No, we won't find a way later,

04:56.540 --> 05:00.299
we burned a battery during descent and
we have nothing to put in the generators.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.060
If we reboot Irene now, we'll use all
our power and we'll be dead in an hour.

05:04.940 --> 05:08.619
The only thing to do now is wait until
the solar panels recharge the batteries,

05:08.620 --> 05:11.940
but with the storm we went through,
the solar panels aren't looking good.

05:12.420 --> 05:14.860
- How long?
- 48 hours.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.779
And how long can we last without Irene?

05:17.780 --> 05:19.100
24 hours.

05:20.180 --> 05:22.980
That sucks. One more day and we'd be good.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.180
And we can't boost the panels?

05:26.580 --> 05:28.420
No, we need a battery.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.619
That's fine, it shouldn't take more than
a couple of months to make one.

05:32.620 --> 05:35.780
There are some. On Z1.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.259
- We don't even know what happened to them.
- You got a better idea?

05:39.260 --> 05:41.259
- MÃ¼ller?
- Yes?

05:41.260 --> 05:44.339
I assume a geologist can tell if
the ground is safe for a rover.

05:44.340 --> 05:46.339
In theory, yes. But...

05:46.340 --> 05:49.419
No buts, you're coming.
Jeanne, get ready too.

05:49.420 --> 05:51.419
Me? But what...

05:51.420 --> 05:54.980
Hold on, I'm sorry
but I think you're forgetting something.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.259
And we're rolling.

05:57.260 --> 05:59.460
The dreams of one generation,

06:00.380 --> 06:02.300
are just the next one's reality.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.140
The first man on Mars.

06:05.420 --> 06:07.940
The first dance on Mars.

06:12.820 --> 06:15.620
Long live the planet Mars!

06:31.860 --> 06:32.940
Yann, can you hear me?

06:34.180 --> 06:36.380
- Yes Simon.
- If you don't hear from us...

06:37.460 --> 06:38.980
you know what to do.

06:39.140 --> 06:40.260
Copy that commander.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.819
What's going on MÃ¼ller?

06:47.820 --> 06:49.419
We're already lost?

06:49.420 --> 06:50.779
No, of course not.

06:50.780 --> 06:52.500
I'm just checking the route.

06:53.220 --> 06:54.380
I wasn't prepared.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.380
Join the club.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.979
Jeanne, you'll find water bottles and
candy in the armrest,

07:00.980 --> 07:03.699
if you have a preferred
itinerary, let me know.

07:03.700 --> 07:06.180
Are you going to tell me why I'm here?
I'm of no use to you.

07:06.740 --> 07:09.100
You said it yourself, I
can't live without you.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.219
Did you find a way?

07:22.220 --> 07:24.859
If your girlfriend wasn't so powerhungry,
I would have a dozen ways.

07:24.860 --> 07:28.179
I'm really sorry that the world's most
sophisticated artificial intelligence

07:28.180 --> 07:29.899
requires more power than your razor.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.380
Can't you just launch
parts of her features?

07:32.700 --> 07:35.700
It's all interwoven, the code's crazy,
it would take days to...

07:36.340 --> 07:39.419
Wait. There was a power saving mode.

07:39.420 --> 07:42.819
I should be able to find it.
Switch off everything we don't use and...

07:42.820 --> 07:44.019
Like Apollo 13?

07:44.020 --> 07:45.460
I don't know, I wasn't born yet.

07:46.980 --> 07:49.020
There's not much left to switch off.

07:56.820 --> 07:57.940
What's that?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.259
I've reconfigured the boot, can I launch?

08:07.260 --> 08:08.420
Wait!

08:10.580 --> 08:11.740
Go, reboot.

08:12.740 --> 08:13.939
Come on, gorgeous.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.300
Wake up.

08:18.780 --> 08:19.780
Are you okay?

08:20.020 --> 08:21.660
How many watts can you give it?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.140
No more than 1500.

08:24.700 --> 08:25.860
Then we're screwed.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.140
No more than that!

08:30.340 --> 08:31.779
Shut it down!

08:31.780 --> 08:33.818
Wait, it's almost complete!

08:33.820 --> 08:35.820
Shut it down, we're using the backup!

08:40.620 --> 08:41.980
Shit!

08:44.540 --> 08:45.620
Fuck.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.300
We're in deep shit.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.500
Basile better be able to reconfigure Irene.

08:53.180 --> 08:55.219
Or we're going to have to be more radical.

08:55.220 --> 08:58.060
Can someone explain why
there's no light in my cabin?

09:01.220 --> 09:02.420
Am I interrupting?

09:17.740 --> 09:20.100
Wait. I think we're close.

09:35.020 --> 09:36.420
Tell Meyer.

09:37.460 --> 09:38.580
He was right.

09:39.340 --> 09:40.740
We're not the first.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.260
Must have been a hell of a storm.

09:59.460 --> 10:00.739
You think they're dead?

10:00.740 --> 10:03.140
I wasn't very optimistic
to begin with but...

10:04.260 --> 10:07.140
- What about us?
- We can give up on finding the batteries.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.459
In theory the solar panels
should be easier to find but...

10:10.460 --> 10:12.460
I think that's a long shot too.

10:12.860 --> 10:15.860
- Why?
- I think even a shrink can recognize a solar panel.

10:16.260 --> 10:17.420
Do you see any?

10:18.140 --> 10:20.060
Let's check out the surroundings.

10:35.380 --> 10:36.860
Can you stop doing that?

10:37.500 --> 10:39.580
- Doing what?
- That. It's not helping.

10:41.260 --> 10:43.460
You're going to figure it out.

10:44.460 --> 10:45.940
I don't have time.

10:46.900 --> 10:48.540
At that rate, I would need days.

10:48.860 --> 10:50.180
We're all going to suffocate.

10:51.460 --> 10:53.020
And I'm going to die a virgin.

10:54.180 --> 10:57.179
Listen kid,
2000 programmers worked on Irene's code.

10:57.180 --> 10:58.819
And I chose to bring you to Mars.

10:58.820 --> 11:01.739
So I know you're doing your best,
and I also know you'll crack this.

11:01.740 --> 11:03.739
But please spare me your life story,

11:03.740 --> 11:06.300
save your oxygen, and hurry up.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.580
No man has ever looked at this place.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.659
When do you plan on telling
us we're not going back?

11:46.660 --> 11:49.100
- I'm not sure I understand.
- Don't play dumb.

11:49.780 --> 11:52.699
You planned for this possibility,
otherwise I wouldn't be here.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.540
You don't need a geologist or a shrink
to go back to Earth.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.779
We're the least useful.

11:57.780 --> 12:00.180
- We can be sacrificed.
- Is this true?

12:02.820 --> 12:04.640
You have a lot of imagination.

12:04.940 --> 12:06.300
And you're a bad liar.

12:06.820 --> 12:08.820
I think I'm going to throw up.

12:09.460 --> 12:10.780
Keep it for later.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.140
There's a solar panel 200 yards this way.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.860
I'm afraid we won't get
to test your theory.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.380
Don't you feel like you're
putting pressure on me?

12:35.860 --> 12:37.540
You speak too much.

12:39.780 --> 12:40.940
<i>Ulysse, do you copy?</i>

12:41.340 --> 12:43.779
Yes Simon, tell me you've found something.

12:43.780 --> 12:45.260
<i>- Do you have batteries?
- No.</i>

12:45.700 --> 12:46.779
<i>There are no batteries.</i>

12:46.780 --> 12:48.180
But I found a solar panel.

12:49.260 --> 12:50.820
It's not too damaged, I think.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.860
<i>Do you think you can hook it to the others?</i>

12:54.220 --> 12:55.260
Yann, can you hear me?

12:56.900 --> 12:58.660
Batteries would have been better.

12:58.900 --> 12:59.900
<i>That's all I have.</i>

13:00.380 --> 13:01.900
What about the Zillion crew?

13:02.820 --> 13:04.140
Gone.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.860
Copy that. We're waiting for you. Over.

13:29.620 --> 13:30.859
Stop, I see something.

13:30.860 --> 13:33.740
- What?
- Stop! I said stop!

13:39.620 --> 13:40.940
I think I saw someone.

13:51.980 --> 13:54.139
He's breathing. He's alive!

13:54.140 --> 13:56.659
- What the hell?
- We have to get him back to Ulysse.

13:56.660 --> 13:58.579
We don't even have enough
oxygen for ourselves.

13:58.580 --> 14:00.940
We're not leaving him.
Don't even think about it.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.419
We're in the airlock.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.540
Get the medical unit ready.

14:18.740 --> 14:20.539
<i>I thought there was nobody on the ship.</i>

14:20.540 --> 14:21.980
He wasn't on the ship.

14:24.220 --> 14:25.899
What the hell, why isn't it opening?

14:25.900 --> 14:27.899
<i>- What the fuck?
- I don't know, try again.</i>

14:27.900 --> 14:29.300
Do something, figure it out.

14:29.420 --> 14:30.500
<i>I'm sorry Simon.</i>

14:30.980 --> 14:33.099
Sorry for what? What are you talking about?

14:33.100 --> 14:35.379
If you get on this ship,
if you use a few more

14:35.380 --> 14:37.180
bars of oxygen to pressurize the airlock...

14:37.460 --> 14:39.179
<i>You know how it's going to end.</i>

14:39.180 --> 14:41.259
Better have four survivors
than eight corpses.

14:41.260 --> 14:43.419
<i>It's a difficult decision, a decision</i>

14:43.420 --> 14:44.739
nobody should have to make.

14:44.740 --> 14:46.020
But I can't let you in.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.500
Eva, I'm sorry.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.500
Yann, open the fucking door!

14:52.820 --> 14:53.859
What are you doing?

14:53.860 --> 14:55.059
- Open it.
- Stop!

14:55.060 --> 14:57.819
You know I can't make those fucking
solar panels work.

14:57.820 --> 15:00.859
- If they get in we're all dead.
- You can't decide for all of us.

15:00.860 --> 15:02.900
You're the one who talked about
a radical solution.

15:09.260 --> 15:10.820
He's waking up.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.500
<i>Hello.</i>

15:16.900 --> 15:18.500
<i>- I'm back.
- Fuck!</i>

15:23.220 --> 15:25.579
Basile, the batteries!
You're going to kill us all!

15:25.580 --> 15:27.099
It's not me, I didn't do anything!

15:27.100 --> 15:29.139
He did it. Everything's working.

15:29.140 --> 15:30.940
And there's still power.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.100
Basile, you're a genius.

15:37.780 --> 15:39.540
See? It wasn't so hard.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.420
We're good.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.420
Take off your helmets.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.820
Let me open this door.

16:01.940 --> 16:02.940
Wait.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.460
What did he say?

16:06.380 --> 16:07.700
Who are you?

16:09.780 --> 16:10.900
Shit!

16:32.780 --> 16:34.220
Where is the Z1 mission crew?

16:36.340 --> 16:38.820
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.459
We found you alone and
unconscious in the desert.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.900
Where is the rest of your crew?

16:46.740 --> 16:48.540
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.980
He seems fine.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.060
If I'm here it means you
must know who I am.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.939
Okay, I think we got off on the wrong foot.

17:00.940 --> 17:03.339
I am Simon Gramat,
second in command on the Ulysse mission.

17:03.340 --> 17:05.339
I'd like to know whose life I just saved.

17:05.339 --> 17:07.740
We have an idea but we'd
like confirmation. Better?

17:08.980 --> 17:11.019
I am Vladimir Komarov.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.660
Colonel and pilot in the Soviet Union army.

17:14.260 --> 17:17.020
I was born on March 16, 1927 in Moscow.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.859
I have the honor of being
part of the space program,

17:21.540 --> 17:24.059
and have been chosen by the First Secretary

17:24.060 --> 17:25.579
to command the Soyuz mission.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.540
I don't know how I got here.

17:32.740 --> 17:35.019
But I will not tell you anything else
about my role

17:35.020 --> 17:36.540
in my country's army.

17:40.740 --> 17:42.220
How old are you colonel?

17:43.660 --> 17:44.740
Forty years old.

17:46.220 --> 17:48.460
Who is the president of the United States?

17:53.620 --> 17:54.940
Lyndon Johnson.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.780
Regressive memory is common in PTSD.

18:16.020 --> 18:18.419
Maybe he's telling us about family stories,

18:18.420 --> 18:19.779
or the last book he read.

18:19.780 --> 18:20.820
What do we do with him?

18:21.500 --> 18:23.659
Usually it only lasts a few days.

18:23.660 --> 18:25.820
I think we should keep him in quarantine.

18:26.060 --> 18:27.100
For safety.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.060
I have a bad feeling about this.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.740
Keep examining him,
and send everything back to Earth.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.300
Did you manage to sleep?

19:11.580 --> 19:12.620
No.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.460
Alessandra, we didn't talk about it but...

19:19.660 --> 19:21.180
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.180
He knew the risks.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.860
There will be a time to think about him,
but not now.

19:29.740 --> 19:32.780
We got an answer from Earth.
You should see it.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.740
Commander, I'm sorry for the delay.

19:36.220 --> 19:37.739
Zillion has just confirmed that

19:37.740 --> 19:39.740
there was no Russian
cosmonaut on their ship.

19:41.620 --> 19:45.060
As for the pictures you took of him,
we have a problem.

19:45.380 --> 19:48.060
You will find a file attached. Open it.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.619
This picture comes from the archives
of the Russian space program.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.620
This is Vladimir Komarov.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.540
He died in 1967 during the atmospheric
reentry of Soyuz 1.

19:58.220 --> 20:00.820
So, I assume there is a
logical explanation.

20:01.540 --> 20:03.900
Komarov would be over 90 years old
if he had survived.

20:16.620 --> 20:17.940
He doesn't look 90.
