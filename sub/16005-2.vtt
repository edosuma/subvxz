10:40.667 --> 10:43.903
Oh, I see.

10:45.639 --> 10:47.540
<i>Stay focused, Chance.</i>

10:47.608 --> 10:49.742
We got to get her
out of there, remember?

10:49.810 --> 10:52.762
Rebecca?
Hi, I'm Kevin.

10:52.846 --> 10:53.779
You are?

10:53.847 --> 10:55.648
Yeah.
That online photo--

10:55.715 --> 10:57.149
it's from a while ago.

10:57.217 --> 10:58.551
It's when I used to
dye my hair.

11:00.587 --> 11:02.088
I hope you're not
disappointed.

11:02.155 --> 11:03.906
No, no, not at all.

11:03.991 --> 11:05.925
Good. This is
kind of new to me--

11:05.993 --> 11:07.927
this Internet dating.

11:07.995 --> 11:09.428
Oh, God, I know.

11:09.496 --> 11:11.531
This is my first time,
actually.

11:11.598 --> 11:12.798
Really? Me too.

11:12.866 --> 11:14.417
All right, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

11:14.501 --> 11:17.570
Kind of a crazy thing--
I have this doctor friend,

11:17.638 --> 11:19.071
he said he got
food poisoning here.

11:19.139 --> 11:20.706
Obviously I probably
shouldn't have recommended

11:20.774 --> 11:21.707
the place, so...

11:21.775 --> 11:22.875
I recommended it.

11:22.943 --> 11:24.977
<i>Oh, yes...</i>

11:25.045 --> 11:28.481
But I agreed
with you, so...

11:28.549 --> 11:30.049
I was wondering
if you're into going

11:30.100 --> 11:31.384
<i>to some other place--</i>

11:31.435 --> 11:32.885
<i>maybe Theodore's</i>
<i>up in North Berkeley?</i>

11:32.936 --> 11:35.187
Uh...

11:35.255 --> 11:37.490
Rebecca?
I'm Kevin.

11:43.564 --> 11:45.798
If you're Kevin,
who are you?

11:45.866 --> 11:47.466
Look, I'm sorry.

11:47.534 --> 11:50.786
I saw your profile.
I really wanted to meet you.

11:50.871 --> 11:53.339
So...
Uh, what's going on?

11:56.743 --> 11:58.144
<i>I-I-I...</i>

11:58.211 --> 12:00.246
It's all too weird for me.

12:00.297 --> 12:01.681
I think I'm just gonna go.

12:01.748 --> 12:03.115
Nice to almost meet you.

12:03.183 --> 12:05.851
Winston, we got our guy.

12:05.919 --> 12:07.453
He's the assassin?
Where's he headed?

12:07.521 --> 12:09.255
Wait, Rebecca.

12:09.323 --> 12:11.123
Don't take one more step
towards me,

12:11.174 --> 12:13.492
or I will call the cops.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.027
You're in danger.

12:15.095 --> 12:17.430
Listen to me.
Stay away from me.

12:32.245 --> 12:34.513
Get in!
Get in now!

12:38.385 --> 12:40.019
What is happening?

12:40.087 --> 12:42.505
- Who are you?
- I'm saving your life.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.333
Aah!

13:17.958 --> 13:19.258
Aah!

13:41.848 --> 13:43.582
Internet dating--

13:43.650 --> 13:45.718
it's crazy, huh?

13:52.365 --> 13:54.300
Give us a second,
Mrs. Brooks.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.938
So is there any I.D.
on the assassin?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.706
No, there was
no trace of him

14:00.774 --> 14:02.942
by the time we reached
the parking garage.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.244
Why is she
in there alone?

14:05.312 --> 14:06.846
I was just in there.

14:06.913 --> 14:10.382
Mrs. Brooks,
my name's Ilsa Pucci.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.184
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.520
How am--how am I doing?
I'm freaking out.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.021
What--
what is this place?

14:16.072 --> 14:17.456
I don't know
what is going on,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.225
and somebody just tried to kill me.
I know.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.759
And you must feel
very frightened right now.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.929
You have no idea
how I feel!

14:26.366 --> 14:28.634
Very recently,
Mr. Chance and his team

14:28.702 --> 14:31.070
helped protect me
after my husband died.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.471
I saw them work.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.607
It's why I'm financing
this company.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.759
<i>These men...</i>

14:36.843 --> 14:39.945
They saved my life.

14:40.013 --> 14:43.515
His name's
Christopher Chance.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.785
And you can trust him.

14:49.723 --> 14:53.192
<i>I still don't understand</i>
<i>exactly what's going on here,</i>

14:53.260 --> 14:55.961
but I-I suppose
I owe you a thank-you.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.196
Well, you can thank us

14:57.264 --> 14:59.064
when you're
out of danger for good.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.133
<i>Mrs. Brooks, we believe that</i>
<i>the attempt on your life today</i>

15:01.201 --> 15:03.235
is directly connected
with your husband's murder.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.137
I don't understand.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.940
My--my husband was killed
in a robbery.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.742
<i>I'm afraid that's not</i>
<i>what we think.</i>

15:09.809 --> 15:11.977
Can you think
of any reason

15:12.045 --> 15:14.280
why someone would have targeted
your husband?

15:14.347 --> 15:15.981
"Targeted"?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.149
No, of course not.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.518
M-my husband was
an Economics Professor.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.186
What was he working on
when he was killed.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.989
Oh...

15:24.057 --> 15:25.791
Um...

15:25.859 --> 15:30.162
W-we share the same
pretty obscure specialty--

15:30.230 --> 15:32.698
predictive economics.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.767
<i>And, um, his last project</i>
<i>was a fairly minor theory.</i>

15:34.834 --> 15:36.969
He loved baseball,
and he was working on a formula

15:37.037 --> 15:39.905
to predict price changes
for ballpark tickets.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.141
I mean, it was certainly
nothing to kill for.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.109
He didn't even
finish it.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.711
You still have
a copy of it?

15:45.779 --> 15:48.113
No.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.784
But I-I just applied
for a Grant to complete it,

15:51.851 --> 15:53.886
to finish it
in his memory.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.021
That's what set this
in motion.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.123
Somebody found out you're
going to finish this paper.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.625
Where are your husband's
papers now, Mrs. Brooks?

15:59.693 --> 16:02.561
All Daniel's work is kept
at the university archives.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.213
I was gonna take it
out this week.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.731
Well, we've got
to get them out now.

16:05.799 --> 16:10.069
There's something in that theory
worth killing for.

16:17.944 --> 16:21.480
Donnelly, dude,
how are you?

16:21.548 --> 16:24.016
Still drinking in the middle
of the afternoon, I see.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.551
You know what?
Good for you.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.920
Liver's pickled
anyway, right?

16:27.988 --> 16:29.555
I told Chance
everything I know.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.823
Yeah, I heard that.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.825
Real bro move of you too.
Thanks for that.

16:32.876 --> 16:33.892
No problem.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.028
Sure you
didn't forget anything?

16:36.096 --> 16:38.731
Positive.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.666
Okay.

16:40.717 --> 16:43.168
Good enough for me.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.871
So I hear you're interested
in switching teams, then, huh?

16:45.939 --> 16:48.407
Coming over to work
for Chance?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.776
Guerrero, don't do this.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.645
If I say anything else,
I'm dead, and you know it.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.347
The way I see it, dude,

16:55.415 --> 16:57.416
it's either you
or Rebecca Brooks.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.151
She's cuter.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.786
Tell me who ordered
the hit now,

17:00.854 --> 17:02.454
or I'll tell everybody
in this bar

17:02.522 --> 17:03.956
you're playing
both sides.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.425
Then I go over
to your daughter's apartment.

17:06.492 --> 17:10.079
She's still
over on Ellis, right?

17:10.163 --> 17:13.432
How long did you expect me
to sit out there?

17:13.500 --> 17:14.733
Who the hell are you?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.602
I told you to wait
in the car.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.070
I'm not your dog.
I'm your girlfriend.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.106
Now, uh, go get me
a cocktail,

17:21.174 --> 17:23.809
introduce me to your friend,
and, uh, start acting

17:23.877 --> 17:25.810
like you're the luckiest guy
in this bar.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.146
Leave...

17:28.214 --> 17:29.314
Now.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.521
I guess my mother was right
about you.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.735
I was just about
to get the info.

17:49.803 --> 17:53.605
I figured whoever
he's been talking to

17:53.673 --> 17:56.608
has got to be
in his recent calls, right?

17:56.676 --> 17:58.577
We could just do
a reverse search on the list,

17:58.645 --> 18:01.280
I.D. the contact.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.115
Let's be clear
about something.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.450
I was just
about to get him

18:04.517 --> 18:05.784
to tell me the name
of his contact,

18:05.852 --> 18:07.152
which, by definition,
would have been faster.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.621
Maybe, but, uh, I just got
the guy's number.

18:09.672 --> 18:12.391
I'm just saying that--

18:14.427 --> 18:16.462
Drive.

18:26.206 --> 18:29.691
We're at the university,
Winston, heading in now.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.046
All right.
Working on the feed.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.048
Stand by.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.283
How are you able
to have access

18:38.351 --> 18:41.220
to the university
security feeds?

18:43.323 --> 18:46.992
You hack in.

18:47.060 --> 18:50.229
Well, I assume
that's illegal.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.965
That an issue?

18:56.136 --> 18:59.071
Halls are clear
to the archives.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.542
Restricted access?
Because of the archives.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.977
Damn it.
What?

19:05.044 --> 19:07.379
<i>It's just--just the clerk</i>
<i>on duty--Harrison.</i>

19:07.447 --> 19:09.348
He's very nice, but he tends
to be incredibly chatty.

19:09.415 --> 19:11.216
He's been asking me out
since Daniel died.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.684
We don't have much time
for small talk.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.186
Maybe I should just go in
and talk to him.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.388
No, no, no.
It'll--it'll--it'll be fine.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.028
Hi.

19:23.096 --> 19:25.430
Professor Brooks...
Hi. Hello.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.100
Um, I haven't seen you
in a while.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.469
Harrison, I-I was wondering
if you could get me

19:30.537 --> 19:32.571
the bin number
for Daniel's papers.

19:32.639 --> 19:33.939
Yeah. Can do.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.375
Uh...

19:36.442 --> 19:40.045
It seems Professor Brooks
had his papers shipped out

19:40.113 --> 19:42.414
July 9, 2003.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.216
That's right
before he died.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.418
Where'd he ship
them to?

19:46.486 --> 19:47.986
Ooh, uh, I'm--
I'm sorry.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.589
I can't give that information
out without written approval.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.424
Harrison, listen to me--
Rebecca...

19:52.492 --> 19:55.277
Let me just have a word
with Harrison.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.068
So, Harrison,

20:03.119 --> 20:05.437
I'm not really a friend
of Mrs. Brooks.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.139
I'm actually
an insurance adjuster.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.107
I'm here to settle some
of her husband's affairs.

20:09.175 --> 20:12.211
Now, she told me
you guys were close.

20:12.278 --> 20:14.012
So I was thinking maybe
you could help her out,

20:14.080 --> 20:15.380
just give us
that address.

20:15.448 --> 20:19.318
Um...

20:19.385 --> 20:22.788
She said we were close?

20:24.807 --> 20:26.825
Don't tell anyone.

20:31.130 --> 20:35.667
8564 Belvedere Road,
Tiburon.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.936
That's a family home
outside the city,

20:38.004 --> 20:40.639
where we used to spend weekends
before Daniel died.

20:40.707 --> 20:44.276
That's where
he was killed.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.649
We got a name
off Donnelly--some lawyer.

20:50.717 --> 20:51.917
We're heading his way now.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.820
Lawyer--
what firm?

20:54.887 --> 20:56.221
<i>Bergman-Fox.</i>

20:56.289 --> 20:58.090
Not a firm,
it's an investment bank--

20:58.157 --> 20:59.424
small and very private.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.126
It's got to be the same people
that hired Chance

21:01.194 --> 21:02.394
to kill Rebecca's husband.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.133
Chance killed her husband?

21:08.201 --> 21:11.136
<i>That's why we're involved</i>
<i>in this case?</i>

21:11.204 --> 21:13.505
And she has no idea?

21:13.573 --> 21:16.024
Winston, I told her
she could trust him.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.576
She can.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.177
Protecting her life
is the only thing

21:19.245 --> 21:21.647
that matters to him
right now.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.716
Winston.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.522
Chance, he's headed
right for you.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.457
<i>He's right around</i>
<i>the corner.</i>

21:32.525 --> 21:33.525
<i>Get down.</i>

21:37.597 --> 21:38.597
<i>Harrison, get down!</i>

21:48.207 --> 21:49.574
Where is he?
<i>He's right on your tail.</i>

21:49.642 --> 21:51.677
You got to get him off you.
He's way too close.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.245
Where am I?

21:53.313 --> 21:54.813
<i>What's around me?</i>
<i>What can I use?</i>

21:54.881 --> 21:58.483
End of the hall, your left,
there's a chem lab.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.354
Okay.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.724
You guys should probably
get out of here. Now!

22:05.792 --> 22:08.827
Grab this extinguisher,
right there.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.890
Come on.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.830
Chem lab's
straight ahead.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.304
<i>He came down this way.</i>

22:54.173 --> 22:56.108
<i>Okay, okay, keep moving.</i>

22:56.175 --> 22:58.310
Keep moving.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.678
Keep moving.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.847
Last door on your right
is an exit.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.317
Hold it. Stop!
Stop.

23:09.055 --> 23:12.791
Come on, we got to try
and sneak past them.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.626
- You okay?
- Not really.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.661
Hey, listen,
you were amazing up there.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.130
All we got to do is
get through this door,

23:18.197 --> 23:19.831
and we're in the car,
okay?

23:19.899 --> 23:23.168
Seeing that man...

23:23.236 --> 23:26.171
Knowing he could be the one
who killed my husband...

23:42.522 --> 23:46.291
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I can't handle this.

23:57.339 --> 23:59.041
You have to believe me.

23:59.124 --> 24:01.209
I don't know anything
about any hit man

24:01.293 --> 24:03.428
or this "books" woman
you keep mentioning.

24:03.495 --> 24:05.630
- Brooks.
- What?

24:05.681 --> 24:07.632
Her name is Brooks,
Rebecca Brooks.

24:07.683 --> 24:09.934
Did I tell him "books"?
I don't think so.

24:10.001 --> 24:11.669
Is that a common
stall tactic--

24:11.737 --> 24:14.171
pretending like they were
told a different name?

24:14.223 --> 24:17.058
It happens occasionally.

24:17.142 --> 24:18.910
Go get my tackle box
out of the car.

24:18.977 --> 24:20.712
It's in the exceptionally
roomy trunk.

24:20.779 --> 24:23.481
Tackle box?
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:23.549 --> 24:24.882
This is--
this is crazy!

24:24.950 --> 24:26.350
I don't know anything!

24:26.418 --> 24:28.619
I am a lawyer
at an investment bank,

24:28.687 --> 24:30.621
for God sakes!

24:30.689 --> 24:34.292
A lawyer
and an investment banker?

24:34.359 --> 24:35.927
Wow.

24:35.994 --> 24:37.862
I'm really gonna
enjoy this.

24:37.913 --> 24:40.631
Have any allergies
I should know about?

24:40.699 --> 24:43.634
Okay, okay.

24:43.702 --> 24:45.970
Look, uh...

24:46.038 --> 24:47.905
All I know is that
this, uh--this woman...

24:47.973 --> 24:50.108
Mrs. Brooks?
Yeah, yeah.

24:50.175 --> 24:52.043
Her husband
was blackmailing the firm.

24:52.111 --> 24:54.245
What did he have
on them?

24:54.313 --> 24:55.813
<i>What's it got to do</i>
<i>with his wife?</i>

24:55.881 --> 24:57.148
I don't know.

24:57.216 --> 24:59.784
All I was told is that
she'd be dealt with. Okay.

24:59.852 --> 25:01.486
<i>Are you stupid or something?</i>

25:01.553 --> 25:04.355
Seriously, are you one
of those guys from Harvard

25:04.406 --> 25:07.258
who can't tie
his own shoes?

25:07.326 --> 25:11.596
Do you have any idea
who this man is?

25:11.663 --> 25:13.397
What Jay-Z is to rap,

25:13.465 --> 25:15.500
what Louis Vuitton is
to luggage,

25:15.567 --> 25:17.952
he is to torturing the truth
out of people.

25:21.440 --> 25:22.673
You done?

25:22.741 --> 25:25.009
You might want to save
the speeches for Malcolm X.

25:25.077 --> 25:26.077
Okay.

25:26.145 --> 25:27.879
We'll find out
what he knows

25:27.946 --> 25:31.215
if you go get my stuff
out of the car.

25:42.294 --> 25:43.361
Damn it!

25:43.428 --> 25:47.365
A simple thank-you
would suffice!

25:52.571 --> 25:54.138
What do you mean
somebody shot him? Who?

25:54.206 --> 25:55.540
<i>Don't know, dude.</i>

25:55.607 --> 25:57.141
The only thing we got
is that the woman's husband

25:57.209 --> 25:58.609
was blackmailing the bank
where the lawyer worked.

25:58.677 --> 26:02.046
Whoever popped the lawyer
sure did have some good timing.

26:02.114 --> 26:04.115
Yeah, a little too good,
if you ask me.

26:04.183 --> 26:06.417
All right, call me
if you get anything else.

26:06.485 --> 26:08.486
What's happened?

26:08.554 --> 26:09.754
The lawyer's dead.

26:09.822 --> 26:12.590
I don't understand.
What does that mean?

26:12.658 --> 26:15.927
Where are you going?
To find him.

26:15.978 --> 26:17.061
Chance is in trouble.

26:17.129 --> 26:18.696
I got to figure out
what's going on.

26:18.764 --> 26:21.632
Yes, but it's his trouble,
isn't it?

26:21.700 --> 26:23.167
Let's be honest here,
Mr. Winston.

26:23.235 --> 26:25.169
Isn't that why he's involved
in the first place--

26:25.237 --> 26:27.305
because of what he did
to her, to her husband,

26:27.372 --> 26:28.506
to all of them?

26:28.574 --> 26:29.841
All due respect,
Mrs. Pucci,

26:29.908 --> 26:31.175
but you knew
about Chance's past

26:31.243 --> 26:32.476
when you decided
to work with us.

26:32.544 --> 26:35.146
I told you
these things get messy.

26:35.214 --> 26:37.548
And not just the logistics,
but that's how it is.

26:37.616 --> 26:39.483
That's how it is for Chance,
for me, for all of us.

26:39.551 --> 26:40.718
And you're right.

26:40.786 --> 26:42.553
His past is the reason
why he's on this case.

26:42.621 --> 26:45.056
It's also the reason why he'd
gladly let himself get killed

26:45.123 --> 26:47.291
to protect Mrs. Brooks,
but I can't let that happen.

26:47.359 --> 26:49.760
Understand?

26:49.828 --> 26:53.097
When this is over,
you'll have to tell her.

26:53.165 --> 26:54.498
And if you don't,
I will.

26:54.566 --> 26:58.035
Hey, let me
tell you something.

26:58.103 --> 27:02.306
When this is over,
if Chance is even alive...

27:02.374 --> 27:04.542
He'll tell her.

27:19.224 --> 27:21.192
Oh...

27:26.131 --> 27:28.933
Daniel's grandfather
built this house.

27:29.001 --> 27:30.501
Listen, I know
this is tough,

27:30.569 --> 27:32.003
but the sooner
we can get in there

27:32.070 --> 27:33.771
and find whatever it was
your husband was working on,

27:33.839 --> 27:35.072
the sooner you can put

27:35.140 --> 27:37.108
whatever it was that happened
to you behind you...

27:37.175 --> 27:39.210
For good.

27:56.762 --> 28:01.532
<i>Do you know if he hs</i>
<i>a separate filing cabinet?</i>

28:01.600 --> 28:03.751
<i>Rebecca,</i>
<i>I need you to focus.</i>

28:03.835 --> 28:05.269
I need your help here.
Whoever this assassin is,

28:05.337 --> 28:06.404
he's probably
on his way here.

28:06.471 --> 28:08.139
Here?

28:08.206 --> 28:09.640
But you sa--

28:09.708 --> 28:11.309
how do you know that?

28:11.376 --> 28:12.777
'Cause it's what
I would do.

28:12.844 --> 28:14.946
In this business, it pays
to assume whoever's after you

28:15.013 --> 28:17.381
is at least as smart
as you are.

28:17.449 --> 28:19.984
There's an attic here.
Is it sealed?

28:20.052 --> 28:22.253
I don't--
I don't think so.

28:22.321 --> 28:23.788
Let's check it out.

28:27.025 --> 28:30.227
I-I don't ever remember
being up here.

28:54.820 --> 28:58.089
What's your birthday?
August 3rd. Why?

29:06.732 --> 29:08.566
A gun?

29:11.870 --> 29:14.905
Why--why would he have
a gun?

29:29.021 --> 29:31.489
Mrs. Pucci,
I'm a nice man,

29:31.556 --> 29:33.157
but everyone
has a breaking point,

29:33.225 --> 29:35.526
and you're about to see mine.
Mr. Winston,

29:35.594 --> 29:36.994
as the owner
of this agency,

29:37.062 --> 29:39.463
I'm just as responsible for
Mr. Chance's actions as he is.

29:39.531 --> 29:41.632
So I suggest you
start driving,

29:41.700 --> 29:44.568
especially if he's in as much
danger as you say he is.

29:46.271 --> 29:47.705
What are you waiting for?

29:47.773 --> 29:50.341
I swear, if you wasn't my boss,
I'd shoot you.

29:52.944 --> 29:56.180
It's--it's remarkable.

29:56.248 --> 29:58.682
It--it turns out
Daniel's theory

29:58.734 --> 30:01.952
can be applied
to stock-market behavior.

30:02.020 --> 30:03.187
I-it basically decodes

30:03.255 --> 30:05.823
how--how you could manipulate
the system.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.192
It's astonish--

30:08.260 --> 30:10.561
Stay calm.

30:16.001 --> 30:17.435
There's a storm door
by the stairs.

30:17.502 --> 30:18.502
We can get out that way.

30:18.570 --> 30:19.837
Storm door--
how do you--

30:19.905 --> 30:21.672
how do you know
about the storm door?

30:21.740 --> 30:25.209
Because I saw it
on the way in.

30:25.277 --> 30:27.011
Rebecca, we've got to
get out of here now.

30:27.079 --> 30:28.712
You don't understand
the kind of man

30:28.780 --> 30:31.549
who is trying to kill you.

30:31.616 --> 30:34.185
And you do, Mr. Chance?

30:34.252 --> 30:37.555
How do you know so much
about this house--

30:37.622 --> 30:40.191
the storm door
and--and the attic?

30:40.258 --> 30:41.592
About all of it--

30:41.660 --> 30:43.727
me and Daniel and--and how all
these pieces fit together?

30:43.795 --> 30:45.729
It's my job.

30:45.797 --> 30:48.833
The storm door...

30:48.900 --> 30:52.136
Is how the police said whoever
killed Daniel got in here.

30:52.204 --> 30:54.038
Rebecca, listen to me...

30:54.106 --> 30:58.342
Do you know who's trying
to kill me?

30:58.410 --> 31:02.546
Do you know
who killed my husband?

31:02.614 --> 31:04.482
Answer me!

31:07.452 --> 31:10.321
I killed your husband.

31:12.424 --> 31:14.291
You what?

31:14.359 --> 31:17.495
Rebecca, I have no idea
how you must be feeling,

31:17.562 --> 31:20.397
but right now I am the only
person who can protect you.

31:23.594 --> 31:26.162
Oh.

31:26.230 --> 31:29.632
You--you killed Daniel!

31:29.700 --> 31:33.403
There is an assassin
in this house.

31:33.470 --> 31:34.671
I can protect you.

31:34.738 --> 31:37.840
I should kill you right now
for what you did!

31:40.811 --> 31:42.278
Rebecca, listen!

31:47.952 --> 31:50.219
Come on, Chance,
answer your phone.

31:50.287 --> 31:52.055
Answer your ph--

31:52.122 --> 31:53.389
Careful!
It won't help anyone

31:53.457 --> 31:57.026
if we don't make it
there alive.

31:57.094 --> 31:59.262
Fine.
Drive how you like.

32:24.088 --> 32:26.723
I knew this case would come back
and bite him in the ass.

32:26.790 --> 32:28.558
<i>I knew it would. That's why</i>
<i>i told him not to take it.</i>

32:28.626 --> 32:29.692
But he didn't listen.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.361
He never listens,
kind of like you,

32:31.428 --> 32:32.729
except at least
he can fight.

32:32.796 --> 32:36.032
I just hope
we ain't too late.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.600
Are you really
that worried about him?

32:37.668 --> 32:39.435
Your damn right
I'm worried about him!

32:39.503 --> 32:40.670
He ain't thinking straight.

32:40.738 --> 32:42.271
Hasn't been thinking straight
this whole case.

32:42.339 --> 32:44.807
What do you mean?
I mean...

32:44.875 --> 32:47.377
Yes, he's done a lot
of terrible things in his past.

32:47.444 --> 32:49.479
I'm not gonna argue
that point.

32:49.546 --> 32:50.747
But he's also the guy

32:50.814 --> 32:52.615
who's trying
to make everything right.

32:52.683 --> 32:55.585
And that makes him vulnerable
to all the bad guys out there

32:55.653 --> 32:57.954
<i>who think</i>
<i>they can exploit that.</i>

32:58.022 --> 33:00.256
I suppose redemption
comes at a price.

33:00.324 --> 33:03.059
Yeah.

33:34.191 --> 33:35.425
Aaah.

34:22.339 --> 34:24.107
Aah!

34:36.954 --> 34:38.888
Rebecca...

34:40.958 --> 34:43.391
You killed Daniel.

34:43.460 --> 34:46.329
You deserve to die.

34:48.665 --> 34:50.533
You're right.

34:50.601 --> 34:52.068
I do.

34:52.136 --> 34:54.504
<i>Go ahead.</i>

34:54.571 --> 34:56.438
<i>Just pull the trigger.</i>

34:56.507 --> 35:00.042
No one will blame you,
least of all me.

35:00.110 --> 35:02.245
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Rebecca, don't--

35:04.681 --> 35:06.415
<i>I got to hand it</i>
<i>to you, Chance.</i>

35:06.483 --> 35:09.152
A part of me was wondering
whether or not

35:09.219 --> 35:10.987
you'd even be able
to pull it off--

35:11.054 --> 35:13.556
protecting her
from that monster,

35:13.624 --> 35:15.758
<i>still finding</i>
<i>the husband's theory.</i>

35:15.826 --> 35:18.427
Who the hell are you?

35:18.495 --> 35:20.963
I'm the man who hired him
to kill your husband.

35:21.031 --> 35:23.065
<i>It wasn't anything personal,</i>
<i>mind you.</i>

35:23.133 --> 35:24.133
<i>It's just business.</i>

35:24.201 --> 35:25.835
Like me killing
you both now--

35:25.903 --> 35:27.637
it's just business.

35:27.704 --> 35:30.606
When I saw how much someone
was offering for the hit,

35:30.674 --> 35:32.275
I figured that theory
would provide me

35:32.342 --> 35:33.743
with a nice retirement.

35:33.811 --> 35:36.746
That's what all this
is about--

35:36.814 --> 35:38.915
about money?

35:38.982 --> 35:40.817
<i>Almost always is...</i>

35:40.884 --> 35:42.518
Except for our friend
Chance here.

35:42.586 --> 35:45.188
<i>This guy's got</i>
<i>a conscience.</i>

35:45.255 --> 35:47.957
I always tried to tell him
that was bad for business,

35:48.025 --> 35:49.192
but he never listened.

35:51.261 --> 35:53.362
I'm sorry
for what I did.

35:53.430 --> 35:56.032
<i>I know</i>
<i>it doesn't matter now,</i>

35:56.099 --> 35:58.034
but...

35:58.101 --> 35:59.435
I'm sorry.

36:11.481 --> 36:13.850
I told you,
I hate bad guys.

36:24.677 --> 36:26.677
Hey dude.

36:26.688 --> 36:27.354
What's this?

36:27.379 --> 36:29.347
It's what we pulled
off the dead lawyer's computer.

36:29.415 --> 36:30.982
It's the full story
on Daniel Brooks.

36:31.033 --> 36:34.052
The, uh-- the guy had been
blackmailing the bank for years,

36:34.120 --> 36:36.621
had a secret account
with millions in the Caymans.

36:36.689 --> 36:38.523
He was planning
on making a run for it,

36:38.591 --> 36:41.392
wasn't really
the settle-down type.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.061
Did someone tell you
to speak?

36:43.129 --> 36:46.231
Okay, you know what?

36:46.298 --> 36:48.833
Enough of the whole
Don Corleone thing.

36:48.901 --> 36:52.937
I'm the one who got the lawyer's
info off Donnelly, remember?

36:53.005 --> 36:55.406
All I'm saying
is I demand some respect.

36:55.474 --> 36:57.475
Demand?

36:59.278 --> 37:01.946
Okay, may--
maybe not demand...

37:02.014 --> 37:04.082
Suggest...Strongly.

37:04.150 --> 37:06.184
- Nice work, Ames.
- Thanks.

37:06.252 --> 37:08.703
My pleasure.

37:08.788 --> 37:11.122
Let's go.

37:11.190 --> 37:13.057
Where?

37:17.596 --> 37:19.731
Okay.

37:22.218 --> 37:25.203
- She has no idea.
- Who?

37:25.271 --> 37:29.140
Rebecca--about who
her husband really was.

37:29.208 --> 37:32.143
That doesn't forgive me
for what I did...

37:32.211 --> 37:34.479
Not to him,
not to anyone else.

37:41.987 --> 37:43.354
Well, the assassin
that Chance took out yesterday

37:43.422 --> 37:44.722
is now in police custody,

37:44.790 --> 37:47.158
but he was just
a hired gun.

37:47.226 --> 37:48.726
The lawyer at the investment
bank was his only contact.

37:48.794 --> 37:49.994
Unfortunately,
Donnelly killed him

37:50.062 --> 37:52.964
<i>before we had a chance</i>
<i>to get enough information.</i>

37:53.032 --> 37:55.800
Tracing things back
to anyone else at the firm

37:55.868 --> 37:58.336
at this point
is highly unlikely.

37:58.404 --> 38:00.071
The formula
your husband created--

38:00.139 --> 38:01.773
it's very, very valuable
information

38:01.841 --> 38:03.141
if it's
in the right hands.

38:03.209 --> 38:05.076
It will be.

38:05.144 --> 38:06.811
I gave it
to a reporter I know

38:06.879 --> 38:08.413
<i>at the</i> National
Business Journal.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.883
Daniel would have been thrilled
to see his work published.

38:15.521 --> 38:17.755
Well, you did
the right thing.

38:17.823 --> 38:21.392
I'm glad
we could help you.

38:28.367 --> 38:32.437
I have to ask you, mrs.Pucci,
how do you do it?

38:32.504 --> 38:34.038
Do what?

38:34.106 --> 38:36.140
Work with him...

38:36.208 --> 38:40.278
<i>Be in the same room</i>
<i>as him.</i>

38:40.346 --> 38:43.581
Rebecca...

38:45.584 --> 38:47.418
I think I understand
how hard

38:47.486 --> 38:51.623
these last few days
have been for you.

38:51.690 --> 38:54.492
I know the pain
of losing someone you love.

38:57.863 --> 39:00.665
<i>I guess</i>
<i>all I can say is...</i>

39:00.733 --> 39:02.867
I hope you find
the strength

39:02.935 --> 39:06.537
to move past all the hurt and
the anger that comes with it.

39:08.774 --> 39:10.842
And I hope I do too.

39:15.581 --> 39:17.548
Mr. Chance...

39:19.785 --> 39:21.653
My husband was
a good man,

39:21.720 --> 39:24.289
an innocent man.

39:26.792 --> 39:28.726
Do you think that saving me
makes up for what you did?

39:28.794 --> 39:30.929
Is that it?

39:33.332 --> 39:36.534
Well, it doesn't.

39:47.479 --> 39:48.846
Why didn't you tell her
the truth

39:48.914 --> 39:50.348
<i>about her husband?</i>

39:50.416 --> 39:51.883
She doesn't need
to hear it.

39:51.951 --> 39:53.551
Well, maybe she does.

39:53.619 --> 39:55.453
That's not
what I'm here for.

39:55.521 --> 39:58.089
I'm here to protect her.
That's what she needed.

39:58.157 --> 39:59.991
That's what I do.

40:07.499 --> 40:09.567
Do you want to tell me
why we're here?

40:09.635 --> 40:11.369
Nope.

40:16.608 --> 40:18.743
Sorry, Guerrero,
bring-your-daughter-to-drink day

40:18.811 --> 40:20.478
isn't until next month.

40:20.546 --> 40:22.213
Nice one, bro--
real zinger.

40:22.281 --> 40:24.082
Reminds me of the joke
I know about your brother.

40:24.149 --> 40:25.483
Carl, right?

40:25.551 --> 40:26.718
Drives a green hatchback.

40:26.785 --> 40:28.386
The punch line is
he drives off a bridge.

40:28.454 --> 40:29.887
You want to hear it?
What do you want?

40:29.955 --> 40:32.423
Club soda.

40:32.491 --> 40:35.226
And, uh...
And what?

40:35.294 --> 40:37.128
And I can't believe
I'm doing this.

40:37.196 --> 40:39.430
Open up a tab for her.

40:41.533 --> 40:42.533
Stop smiling.

40:42.601 --> 40:49.440
♪ ♪

40:52.461 --> 41:00.585
♪ ♪

41:00.652 --> 41:02.854
Expense reports.

41:02.921 --> 41:06.290
How is he okay
with it?

41:06.358 --> 41:08.760
With what?

41:08.827 --> 41:10.995
All of it.

41:11.063 --> 41:14.432
He's not.
None of us are.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.901
That's why we try to make
things right when we can...

41:16.969 --> 41:18.202
If we can.

41:20.989 --> 41:23.007
Somebody gonna answer that?

41:33.652 --> 41:35.353
Hello?

41:35.421 --> 41:38.056
<i>Yeah, I got your agency's</i>
<i>number from a friend.</i>

41:38.123 --> 41:40.791

41:40.843 --> 41:43.044
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

41:43.112 --> 41:46.364
Yes, I think
we can help.
