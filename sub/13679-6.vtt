WEBVTT

00:01.705 --> 00:04.636
<i>- Previously on American Gothic...</i>
- ALISON: <i>This is Naomi.</i>

00:04.739 --> 00:07.907
- My new campaign manager.
- BRADY: <i>That is the belt that was used</i>

00:07.909 --> 00:10.690
<i>to strangle David Morales,
and that is Cam wearing it.</i>

00:10.692 --> 00:12.945
Our focus now is on Cam Hawthorne.

00:12.947 --> 00:14.847
BRADY: He had this in his
arm, ready to shoot up.

00:14.849 --> 00:17.550
- Now it's got his DNA on it.
- CAM: <i>I've had these images</i>

00:17.552 --> 00:19.185
<i>in my head of somebody dragging a body</i>

00:19.187 --> 00:21.187
<i>down the stairs. The spindle breaking...</i>

00:21.189 --> 00:22.868
you know, what if I was
a part of something?

00:22.893 --> 00:23.689
He was hallucinating.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.791
It's happened before when he's
gone through withdrawal.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.426
Buprenorphine... where did you get this?

00:27.428 --> 00:27.937
A friend.

00:27.962 --> 00:29.970
CHRISTINA: <i>Yeah, my
father was a victim</i>

00:29.971 --> 00:31.397
<i>of the Silver Bells Killer.</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:33.399
I want to take you somewhere.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.834
BRADY: <i>Cam wasn't a match.</i>

00:34.836 --> 00:38.404
But there was familial match.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.143
<i>One of them is Silver Bells.</i>

00:41.142 --> 00:44.487
TESSA: <i>I used to have these
incredibly vivid nightmares</i>

00:44.488 --> 00:45.244
<i>when I was little.</i>

00:45.246 --> 00:48.881
Maybe this is one of those.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.617
ALISON: <i>What a special night.</i>

00:51.619 --> 00:53.152
I love that we're holding this debate

00:53.154 --> 00:54.987
at James Monroe High School,

00:54.989 --> 00:56.188
my father's alma mater.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.791
He played football... quarterback.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.659
Tough, competitive,

01:00.661 --> 01:02.128
devoted to the school.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.096
In fact, the trophy
case in the hall displays

01:04.098 --> 01:07.199
Dad's jersey from one of
his most well-known games...

01:07.201 --> 01:09.468
when he led the team to
the state championship

01:09.470 --> 01:12.338
even after breaking his
nose in the first quarter.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.607
That's what my dad was made of,

01:14.609 --> 01:16.776
determination, focus,

01:16.778 --> 01:18.644
grit.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.247
And that's what I intend to
bring to the office of mayor.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.015
TESSA: <i>Can't you go any faster?</i>

01:23.017 --> 01:25.751
I can't let her be
blindsided on live TV.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.153
I'm already speeding, Tess.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.288
Have you tried Tom, have
you tried Naomi?

01:29.290 --> 01:30.823
Yes. No one has picked up.

01:30.825 --> 01:32.224
I thought that we were helping

01:32.226 --> 01:33.793
by testing Cam's DNA.

01:33.795 --> 01:35.861
I thought it would make it all go away

01:35.863 --> 01:37.930
Yeah, I know. Me too.

01:37.932 --> 01:40.599
ALISON: <i>The stakes
here could not be higher.</i>

01:40.601 --> 01:43.602
Gun violence is a public health crisis,

01:43.604 --> 01:45.871
just like drunk
driving and cigarette smoking.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.392
CONLEY: That's why I propose
stricter background checks

01:48.393 --> 01:50.143
to ensure the only guns in this city

01:50.144 --> 01:51.637
are in the hands of
responsible, conscientious...

01:51.662 --> 01:52.144
It's a crisis...

01:52.146 --> 01:54.146
- gun owners.
- That requires sweeping reform,

01:54.148 --> 01:56.348
- not baby steps.
- Under my leadership,

01:56.350 --> 01:58.517
Boston's gun homicide
rate is the lowest it's been

01:58.519 --> 02:00.252
- in five years.
- But the number

02:00.254 --> 02:02.688
of shootings has actually
risen sharply in that time.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.256
More people have been shot.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.225
The fact that more
people didn't die is luck,

02:06.227 --> 02:07.426
not leadership.

02:07.428 --> 02:10.262
- (crowd applauds)
- She's good...

02:10.264 --> 02:13.599
way smarter than the bald guy.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.801
Every citizen of this
country has a constitutional right

02:15.803 --> 02:16.571
to protect themselves.

02:16.596 --> 02:18.037
ALISON: Bill, guns
don't make you safer.

02:18.039 --> 02:19.805
- Ever.
- CONLEY: That's your opinion.

02:19.807 --> 02:23.342
ALISON: And the opinion
of the CDC, FBI and DOJ.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.544
(door opens, closes)

02:28.049 --> 02:31.217
We'll now open the floor to
our first question from the press.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.185
Jennie Windham, Channel 12.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.087
My question is not on gun control,

02:35.089 --> 02:36.722
but a breaking news report.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.024
Councilor Hawthorne-Price,
would you care to comment

02:39.026 --> 02:40.459
on the fact the police have just

02:40.461 --> 02:41.827
linked the DNA of the
Silver Bells Killer

02:41.829 --> 02:43.729
to a member of your immediate family?

02:43.731 --> 02:47.199
My source has confirmed the police
tested your brother Cam's

02:47.201 --> 02:49.335
DNA and although it
didn't match him, it did show

02:49.337 --> 02:51.237
a familial link to
blood on the murder weapon

02:51.239 --> 02:52.972
recovered at the tunnel collapse...

02:52.974 --> 02:55.374
blood believed to belong to SBK.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.576
Any idea which member of your family

02:57.578 --> 02:59.578
might be Silver Bells?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.780

03:30.939 --> 03:33.707
Okay, time for bed.

03:33.709 --> 03:35.876
Let's go.

03:35.878 --> 03:38.078
Where the hell is Garrett?

03:40.916 --> 03:44.551
Our lawyer says they want
DNA samples from all of us.

03:44.553 --> 03:47.821
And she counsels us to
comply if they get a warrant.

03:47.823 --> 03:51.291
And they will get a warrant.

03:51.293 --> 03:55.996
- How the hell did they get your DNA?
- I have no idea.

03:55.998 --> 03:58.365
Brady found Cam with some paraphernalia.

03:58.367 --> 03:59.666
He took it.

03:59.668 --> 04:01.568
Wh... You what?

04:01.570 --> 04:04.304
- Hold on.
- He asked my permission to test it,

04:04.306 --> 04:06.206
permission I gave.

04:06.208 --> 04:07.974
Why would you do that, Tessa?

04:07.976 --> 04:09.943
To get the cops off your back.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.878
MADELINE: You sided with Brady

04:11.880 --> 04:14.059
after he betrayed you once?

04:14.200 --> 04:16.420
You weren't here, Mom. You
didn't see the police nearly

04:16.422 --> 04:18.151
knock down the door looking for him.

04:18.153 --> 04:20.420
They harassed Jack at school.

04:20.422 --> 04:24.024
I knew Cam was innocent and
that his DNA would prove it. So, yes,

04:24.026 --> 04:27.160
Brady and I made a judgment
call while you were off at the spa.

04:27.162 --> 04:29.896
ALISON: It's irrelevant.

04:29.898 --> 04:31.932
How they got the DNA,

04:31.934 --> 04:34.067
why Tessa did it...

04:34.069 --> 04:36.369
it's irrelevant now.

04:36.371 --> 04:38.705
Can't be changed.

04:38.707 --> 04:42.576
Only one thing matters.

04:42.578 --> 04:45.002
Which one of us is it?

04:53.486 --> 04:55.889
ANNOUNCER: And Boston won a
close one over Kansas City,

04:55.891 --> 04:58.592
three to two. And in our top news story,

04:58.594 --> 05:01.027
tonight's mayoral debate ended in chaos

05:01.029 --> 05:04.197
when it was revealed that a
DNA test linked the family

05:04.199 --> 05:06.433
of candidate Alison Hawthorne-Price

05:06.435 --> 05:08.168
to the notorious killer.

05:18.213 --> 05:19.779
- A map.
- (chuckles)

05:19.781 --> 05:21.147
Old school.

05:21.149 --> 05:23.583
Yeah.

05:28.891 --> 05:30.590
Hey.

05:30.592 --> 05:32.826
We had a deal.

05:32.828 --> 05:34.594
No cell phones for your trip?

05:34.596 --> 05:35.795
Mm-hmm.

05:35.797 --> 05:37.898
But what are you giving up?

05:37.900 --> 05:40.934
Well, I will also
agree to give up cell phones.

05:40.936 --> 05:42.202
How about that?

05:42.204 --> 05:44.337
Cheater.

05:44.339 --> 05:47.007
I brought you out here to
get away from all that.

05:47.009 --> 05:48.775
The noise.

05:48.777 --> 05:51.111
Well, I don't mind the noise.

05:51.113 --> 05:53.380
Well, you might like silence more,

05:53.382 --> 05:55.015
if you give it a chance.

05:55.017 --> 05:56.716
(horn honking)

05:56.718 --> 05:58.752
Yeah! (whooping)

05:58.754 --> 06:00.453
(honking continues)

06:00.455 --> 06:02.122
Yeah, you got a point.

06:02.124 --> 06:03.390
Mm.

06:03.392 --> 06:05.659
Honestly, that's super dumb.

06:05.661 --> 06:08.628
They just sit there hoping for a photo?

06:08.630 --> 06:10.363
CAM: They're vultures.

06:10.365 --> 06:12.165
So...

06:12.167 --> 06:15.569
they wait for injured animals
to die so they can eat them?

06:16.805 --> 06:18.972
Pretty much.

06:21.443 --> 06:23.143
I'm going outside.

06:23.145 --> 06:25.345
They can't encroach on
private property like this.

06:28.350 --> 06:29.583
(door opens)

06:29.585 --> 06:31.151
- This is ridiculous.
- (door closes)

06:31.153 --> 06:33.486
DNA results mean nothing.

06:33.488 --> 06:36.022
Police manipulate evidence all the time

06:36.024 --> 06:37.791
to fit whatever narrative they please.

06:37.793 --> 06:41.027
The police wouldn't... Yes, they would.

06:41.029 --> 06:42.629
When that belt surfaced,

06:42.631 --> 06:45.498
it shined a light on
their ineptitude all over again.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.600
And when they connected the belt

06:46.602 --> 06:49.603
to us, police saw an opportunity

06:49.605 --> 06:52.272
for the perfect frame job.

06:52.274 --> 06:56.176
And now they've tied it up in
a big DNA bow for the public.

06:56.178 --> 06:59.512
Police don't want the truth.

06:59.514 --> 07:01.414
They want blood.

07:01.416 --> 07:04.017
Someone they can
parade as their big catch.

07:04.019 --> 07:06.953
- Their killer.
- (door opens, closes)

07:06.955 --> 07:09.255
Whether that person did it or not.

07:11.426 --> 07:14.094
They got their warrant.

07:31.713 --> 07:34.080
Tessa was ten when the murders started.

07:34.082 --> 07:36.616
Fun fact, many experts believe

07:36.618 --> 07:39.719
psychopathy is set by age five.

07:41.990 --> 07:43.189
I think we're done here.

07:43.191 --> 07:45.291
Not quite. We need a sample

07:45.293 --> 07:48.261
from Garrett Hawthorne as well.

07:48.263 --> 07:50.296
Then you should find him.

07:50.298 --> 07:52.265
We'd like to know where he is, too.

07:52.267 --> 07:55.735
There must be something in
this house with his DNA on it.

07:55.737 --> 07:59.039
Oh, for God's sake, take one
of his Filly Diner cups.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.574
There's half dozen in his room.

08:04.246 --> 08:06.279
I can't find the food.

08:06.281 --> 08:08.248
Oh, I didn't bring food.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.683
Okay.

08:09.685 --> 08:11.584
I hunt.

08:11.586 --> 08:14.220
Yeah, I figured I'll kill us a rabbit.

08:14.222 --> 08:16.289
And then maybe

08:16.291 --> 08:19.492
I'll teach you how to gut it.

08:19.494 --> 08:21.995
If you're not squeamish.

08:21.997 --> 08:23.530
Just vegan.

08:35.143 --> 08:36.842
Vegan chili.

08:40.816 --> 08:42.381
I'm glad we did this.

08:42.384 --> 08:44.851
You were right about unplugging.

08:46.888 --> 08:49.723
Well, you got me here
all alone in the woods.

08:51.827 --> 08:54.461
Now what?

08:56.565 --> 08:58.465
How about, uh...

08:58.467 --> 09:00.633
how about dinner first?

09:03.739 --> 09:06.673
TESSA: I'm not hungry.

09:06.675 --> 09:08.074
Me neither.

09:08.076 --> 09:10.443
Why did I waste my time with this?

09:10.445 --> 09:11.811
You cooked this?

09:11.813 --> 09:13.613
I do know how to cook.

09:13.615 --> 09:17.150
I sent the staff home for a
few days because of everything.

09:17.152 --> 09:19.819
And I thought, since we're all here...

09:19.821 --> 09:21.221
or, most of us...

09:21.223 --> 09:23.189
that we could have dinner together.

09:23.191 --> 09:25.391
Alison?

09:29.898 --> 09:32.532
No one? Cam?

09:32.534 --> 09:34.300
Honestly,

09:34.302 --> 09:36.002
it looks like human remains,

09:36.004 --> 09:38.355
- and given the circumstances...
- (Madeline sighs)

09:47.883 --> 09:50.049
Dessert?

10:00.383 --> 10:03.150
Time for you to get ready for bed.

10:05.421 --> 10:09.190
I'll bring you a
plate of something later.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.931
Okay, even though no
one wants to say it,

10:16.933 --> 10:18.632
- we all know exactly who it is.
- How can you

10:18.634 --> 10:20.301
still have it out for Garrett

10:20.303 --> 10:22.136
- after you saw how he helped Cam?
- That doesn't change

10:22.138 --> 10:23.771
the facts that are very clear now,

10:23.773 --> 10:26.006
he left Boston days
after the last murder

10:26.008 --> 10:27.441
and once he was gone
the killings stopped.

10:27.443 --> 10:29.643
- Coincidence.
- And then the DNA bombshell

10:29.645 --> 10:31.679
drops today and what
happens? He vanishes.

10:31.681 --> 10:32.813
- Unfortunate timing.
- (scoffs)

10:32.815 --> 10:33.914
Oh, you're a child.

10:33.916 --> 10:35.683
That's how you think of him...

10:35.685 --> 10:37.251
like you did when you were nine.

10:37.253 --> 10:38.552
When he was your best friend

10:38.554 --> 10:41.389
and your hero. It makes you blind.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.390
My money's on Dad.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.424
What?

10:43.426 --> 10:44.658
When I was 17,

10:44.660 --> 10:46.360
I saw someone drag a dead body

10:46.362 --> 10:48.696
down the stairs.

10:48.698 --> 10:50.464
What? You saw what?

10:50.466 --> 10:52.400
I remembered it when I was
going through my withdrawal.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.235
It was something my mind
pushed away to protect me.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.303
Wait, who was dragging what?

10:56.305 --> 10:57.671
A body.

10:57.673 --> 10:59.707
I don't know who was dragging it.

10:59.709 --> 11:02.243
But Dad makes sense.
He was the right age,

11:02.245 --> 11:04.612
he kept the bells in the
shed. A-And look at

11:04.614 --> 11:07.014
where they ditched the
belt... at one of the build sites.

11:07.016 --> 11:08.883
You know Garrett hated
anything to do with the business.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.384
Why would he go there to dump a weapon?

11:10.386 --> 11:11.886
To frame Dad.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.554
Dad's favorite book

11:13.556 --> 11:14.855
was Wuthering Heights.

11:14.857 --> 11:16.457
He-he rescued a hurt squirrel

11:16.459 --> 11:17.758
from under the house.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.294
He donated thousands to help refugees,

11:20.296 --> 11:22.897
to lobby against
capital punishment, I mean, he...

11:22.899 --> 11:24.865
No, that last one
doesn't help prove your case.

11:24.867 --> 11:26.567
Look, I'm telling
you what I remembered...

11:26.569 --> 11:29.437
a body being dragged down the stairs.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.839
MADELINE: You were
withdrawing from drugs.

11:31.841 --> 11:33.474
Your mind was playing tricks on you.

11:33.476 --> 11:35.309
I thought that, too, but
every time I had the dream,

11:35.311 --> 11:37.211
the dead man's boots...

11:37.213 --> 11:39.146
as he was being
dragged down the stairs...

11:39.148 --> 11:40.714
his boot snapped a spindle.

11:40.716 --> 11:42.483
- That's enough.
- I checked the spindle.

11:42.485 --> 11:45.119
It was damaged.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.987
What I saw was real.

11:46.989 --> 11:49.123
That's enough!

11:50.893 --> 11:52.893
Now, the-the cops and the press

11:52.895 --> 11:55.863
are trying to get into our heads.

11:55.865 --> 11:58.999
Get us to turn on one
another, rip us apart.

11:59.001 --> 12:01.001
We can't allow it.

12:01.003 --> 12:03.337
I won't allow it!

12:04.540 --> 12:08.075
Now, I want everyone to go to bed.

12:08.077 --> 12:10.778
It-It's... (laughs) it's 9:00.

12:10.780 --> 12:13.080
Right now.

12:13.082 --> 12:14.648
Go to your rooms.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.254
So, no bedtime story time first?

12:20.256 --> 12:21.689
(chair slides out)

12:26.229 --> 12:28.729
CAM: <i>Yeah, Soph,
obviously, everyone's upset.</i>

12:28.731 --> 12:31.899
Well, we'll soon find out who it is.

12:31.901 --> 12:34.969
Yes, Jack's all right, he's
about to go to sleep.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.137
Here. Say good night to your mom.

12:37.139 --> 12:39.673
- Night, Mom.
- See?

12:39.675 --> 12:41.442
- All good.
- (phone beeps)

12:41.444 --> 12:43.511
Good night.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.312
(exhales)

12:45.314 --> 12:47.047
Wow.

12:47.049 --> 12:49.550
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:49.552 --> 12:51.519
I'm reading about vultures.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.621
The real ones or the
ones camped outside?

12:53.623 --> 12:55.289
The real ones.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.424
They're birds of prey.

12:57.426 --> 13:00.427
Did you know that secret psychopaths

13:00.429 --> 13:03.531
often decorate their
homes with predatory birds?

13:03.533 --> 13:05.099
Hmm.

13:05.101 --> 13:06.534
It's a subconscious manifestation

13:06.536 --> 13:08.235
of their own predatory instincts.

13:08.237 --> 13:09.703
Interesting.

13:13.342 --> 13:16.010
This house is full of predatory birds.

13:21.317 --> 13:23.150
STEVE HARVEY: Name a
place no one wants to go.

13:23.152 --> 13:24.685
- Prison.
- (TV buzzer ringing)

13:24.687 --> 13:27.922
The girls are down.

13:27.924 --> 13:29.890
Why don't y'all name a
place no one wants to go.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.358
Hell.

13:33.262 --> 13:34.628
Hey, Ali.

13:34.630 --> 13:36.630
(laughter, indistinct
talking, bell ding)

13:36.632 --> 13:40.568
Gonna get through this, okay?

13:40.570 --> 13:43.537
I love you.

13:43.539 --> 13:45.940
I'm here for you.

13:45.942 --> 13:48.175
(cheering and applause)

13:48.177 --> 13:50.811
I'm sorry, I just...

13:52.448 --> 13:56.216
I just don't want to be touched.

13:56.218 --> 13:58.485
Right.

13:58.487 --> 14:00.921
I guess that's Naomi's department now.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.456
What?

14:02.458 --> 14:05.025
I see the way you two
look at each other.

14:05.027 --> 14:07.294
It's a lot more than a fling.

14:09.532 --> 14:12.132
That's what you're
focusing on right now?

14:15.571 --> 14:18.138
I don't hear you denying it.

14:18.140 --> 14:19.974
(soft chuckle)

14:19.976 --> 14:21.575
(TV turns off)

14:23.913 --> 14:25.312
(door opens, then slams)

14:47.069 --> 14:48.268
SOPHIE: Hey.

14:48.270 --> 14:51.238
Oh, geez.

14:51.240 --> 14:54.008
How the hell'd you get in here?

14:54.010 --> 14:56.644
Still remember how to
sneak into this place.

14:56.646 --> 14:57.945
(sighs)

14:57.947 --> 14:59.647
If you think I'm
going to leave my kid here

14:59.649 --> 15:03.083
without me right now, you're
out of your mind.

15:03.085 --> 15:05.321
SOPHIE: Why didn't you tell
me about this until now?

15:05.450 --> 15:08.856
Because I was afraid if I told
you'd think I was involved.

15:08.858 --> 15:11.291
When have I ever
assumed the worst about you?

15:11.293 --> 15:13.594
I believe in you.

15:13.596 --> 15:16.096
I trust you.

15:16.098 --> 15:18.132
Your family thinks I'm
the poison in your life,

15:18.134 --> 15:20.868
but it's them.

15:20.870 --> 15:22.770
Baby, you need to get
away from this place

15:22.772 --> 15:24.705
before they suck you down with them.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.645
They're my family, Soph.

15:31.647 --> 15:33.514
No.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.582
We are.

15:35.584 --> 15:37.017
Me and Jack.

15:38.954 --> 15:40.888
Let's get to sleep.

16:16.258 --> 16:17.591
CAM: <i>What you looking for?</i>

16:17.593 --> 16:19.560
I don't know.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.295
I just couldn't sleep.

16:21.297 --> 16:22.796
Yeah, me neither.

16:27.536 --> 16:29.436
(papers rustling)

16:29.438 --> 16:31.105
I was trying to remind myself

16:31.107 --> 16:33.307
of who Garrett is.

16:34.910 --> 16:37.878
He took me trick-or-treating.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.047
He taught me how to
cross the monkey bars.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.221
Holy crap.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.556
Has that always been here?

16:49.558 --> 16:51.391
Yeah.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.499
- Oh.
- (stifled laugh)

17:00.836 --> 17:02.469
- Why are you laughing?
- (snickering)

17:02.471 --> 17:03.904
It's not funny.

17:03.906 --> 17:07.775
I'm sorry it's just all so... (laughing)

17:07.777 --> 17:09.609
(laughing): It's...

17:09.612 --> 17:11.145
It's not...

17:13.449 --> 17:15.782
(both laughing)

17:18.521 --> 17:20.654
- It's the worst thing.
- I know.

17:20.656 --> 17:22.189
It's not funny.

17:22.191 --> 17:24.057
It's horrible.

17:24.059 --> 17:26.993
The worst thing that's ever ha...

17:26.996 --> 17:29.930
(both laughing hysterically)

17:36.939 --> 17:40.340
(laughter dies down, Cam sighs)

17:44.079 --> 17:46.346
♪ ♪

18:16.111 --> 18:18.378
♪ ♪

18:31.560 --> 18:33.527
(chuckles)

18:33.529 --> 18:35.529
Remember this?

18:35.531 --> 18:38.732
I accidentally dropped
it off the balcony.

18:38.734 --> 18:41.134
I was eight.

18:41.136 --> 18:43.403
I was just afraid Garret
was gonna be mad,

18:43.405 --> 18:46.373
but he just laughed.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.242
Once I took his bike without asking,

18:48.244 --> 18:50.077
and he punched me in the face.

18:50.079 --> 18:52.346
That doesn't sound like Garrett.

18:52.348 --> 18:56.416
Eh, we just remember him differently.

18:56.418 --> 18:58.952
Which Garrett was it that nursed
you through withdrawals?

18:58.954 --> 19:02.756
Oh, the same Garrett that
tied me up on the bathroom floor.

19:02.758 --> 19:05.659
While he got you meds.

19:05.661 --> 19:07.194
Make up your mind.

19:07.196 --> 19:10.197
At dinner, you made a
pretty good case it was Dad.

19:10.199 --> 19:12.733
ALISON: What if it was Dad?

19:15.070 --> 19:16.904
Found something.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.805
Police report?

19:21.143 --> 19:23.277
“Beat victim unconscious?”

19:23.279 --> 19:25.646
Nearly to death.

19:29.385 --> 19:32.419
Maybe he was a killer.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.437
(Eporters talking
indistinctly, cameras flashing)

19:48.489 --> 19:50.656
ALISON: Did you know about that?

19:50.658 --> 19:52.624
It happened around the
time of the SBK murders.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.860
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

19:54.862 --> 19:57.496
Your father was not a violent man.

19:57.498 --> 20:00.466
This... was an isolated incident.

20:00.468 --> 20:01.967
Then explain it to us.

20:01.969 --> 20:04.603
'Cause it looks really, really bad.

20:05.773 --> 20:07.206
Oh...

20:11.445 --> 20:13.512
It was completely my fault.

20:14.849 --> 20:16.682
Your father found out

20:16.684 --> 20:18.717
that I was having an
affair with another man.

20:18.719 --> 20:20.452
What?

20:20.454 --> 20:23.322
You all may not know this yet,

20:23.324 --> 20:26.125
but marriages often get to
a point when the person

20:26.127 --> 20:29.394
who is the source of your
happiness suddenly seems

20:29.396 --> 20:31.930
to be the one standing in the way of it.

20:31.932 --> 20:33.832
I was weak.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.567
And your father found out.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.269
And beat the crap out of the guy?

20:37.271 --> 20:39.037
No, he demanded that I end it,

20:39.039 --> 20:40.339
or he'd file for divorce.

20:40.341 --> 20:41.373
Who was it?

20:41.375 --> 20:42.674
It doesn't matter.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.376
I ended it.

20:44.378 --> 20:46.145
But he wanted to see me again.

20:46.147 --> 20:48.280
And one night, I was
upstairs in the bedroom,

20:48.282 --> 20:50.048
and the housekeeper let him in, and...

20:50.050 --> 20:52.351
we were just talking.

20:52.353 --> 20:53.786
But your dad found us.

20:53.788 --> 20:55.387
And he just...

20:55.389 --> 20:57.990
snapped.

20:57.992 --> 21:01.360
He beat him unconscious.

21:01.362 --> 21:03.862
And he dragged him down the stairs

21:03.864 --> 21:05.317
and onto the porch.

21:05.424 --> 21:06.899
A neighbor saw him, called the police.

21:06.901 --> 21:08.267
CAM: Wait, so,

21:08.269 --> 21:10.402
when Dad dragged the
guy down the stairs...

21:10.404 --> 21:11.737
That's what you saw.

21:11.739 --> 21:13.338
It was real.

21:13.340 --> 21:17.042
I was just too ashamed to
admit the truth earlier.

21:17.044 --> 21:18.210
So, it wasn't a dead body?

21:18.212 --> 21:19.178
No.

21:19.180 --> 21:22.514
Your father loved you all so much.

21:22.516 --> 21:24.316
But he was human.

21:24.318 --> 21:25.984
He made mistakes.

21:25.986 --> 21:29.688
And this... was one of his worst.

21:30.691 --> 21:32.991
I swear to you

21:32.993 --> 21:37.296
your father was not the
Silver Bells Killer.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.800
CAM: <i>Do you believe her?</i>

21:41.802 --> 21:43.468
You think she's lying?

21:43.470 --> 21:46.071
It just seems like she
has an answer for everything.

21:46.073 --> 21:48.540
We see bells in the shed,

21:48.542 --> 21:49.975
Mom says he's got dementia.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.577
I see a body on the
stairs, suddenly Dad's

21:51.579 --> 21:52.911
dragging her lover down the stairs?

21:52.913 --> 21:54.213
You think she's covering for him?

21:54.215 --> 21:55.614
Not necessarily.

21:55.616 --> 21:57.182
Everyone assumes Silver Bells is a man.

21:57.184 --> 21:58.951
It's pretty sexist, if you ask me.

21:58.953 --> 21:59.985
So now Mom's SBK?

21:59.987 --> 22:01.220
Maybe it's you.

22:01.222 --> 22:02.454
- (chuckles)
- Huh?

22:02.456 --> 22:04.556
You're morally flexible.

22:04.558 --> 22:06.792
What? Everyone knows you're
sleeping with Naomi.

22:06.794 --> 22:08.694
Sorry, everyone but Tessa.

22:08.696 --> 22:09.928
Is that true?

22:09.930 --> 22:11.697
- Are you cheating on Tom?
- No.

22:11.699 --> 22:13.932
- I'm not.
- Oh, you're good.

22:13.934 --> 22:16.368
Of course you are, you're a politician.

22:16.370 --> 22:18.904
You lie and fake
empathy for a living.

22:18.906 --> 22:20.739
You have to maintain a high degree

22:20.741 --> 22:23.275
of emotional detachment
in order to multi-task.

22:23.277 --> 22:25.244
Charming, but narcissistic.

22:25.246 --> 22:27.980
All the benchmarks of a psychopath.

22:27.982 --> 22:29.748
Do you see what you did?

22:29.750 --> 22:31.750
- What I did?
- You gave them the DNA.

22:31.752 --> 22:34.519
You set this whole nightmare in motion.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.288
We're trapped in this
house turning on each other

22:36.290 --> 22:37.289
because of you.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.390
Yeah, this is you.

22:38.392 --> 22:39.925
I thought you s-said what I did

22:39.927 --> 22:41.426
- didn't matter anymore.
- (scoffs)

22:41.428 --> 22:43.929
I said it can't be changed.

22:43.931 --> 22:45.664
Let's just stop finger-pointing

22:45.666 --> 22:47.366
and focus on finding Garrett.

22:47.368 --> 22:49.134
Because if the cops get to him first,

22:49.136 --> 22:51.169
we all know how that's gonna end up.

22:53.340 --> 22:56.508
You seem very comfortable out here.

22:59.280 --> 23:02.614
Yeah, I used to live in
the woods for a while.

23:02.616 --> 23:04.650
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

23:04.652 --> 23:07.252
How long?

23:07.254 --> 23:09.922
14 years.

23:09.924 --> 23:12.291
“14 years”?

23:12.293 --> 23:13.292
How was that?

23:13.294 --> 23:14.760
It was beautiful.

23:14.762 --> 23:17.829
It was quiet, uh...

23:17.831 --> 23:20.799
Hard winters, but it's

23:20.801 --> 23:23.368
so simple.

23:24.371 --> 23:27.673
Eat, read, sleep.

23:27.675 --> 23:29.541
Stay warm.

23:29.543 --> 23:31.743
So simple.

23:31.745 --> 23:35.380
Don't you have a family?

23:35.382 --> 23:37.449
I mean, didn't they miss you?

23:37.451 --> 23:41.119
Yeah, I have a family.

23:41.121 --> 23:44.456
But I don't know whether...

23:44.458 --> 23:46.992
My little sister might've missed me.

23:46.994 --> 23:49.394
Maybe.

23:49.396 --> 23:52.965
I missed her.

23:52.967 --> 23:56.101
And that's why you came back?

23:56.103 --> 23:59.838
I came back because my father was dying.

24:01.508 --> 24:04.042
And then he did.

24:04.044 --> 24:06.578
I'm sorry.

24:08.582 --> 24:11.783
I was gonna leave after the funeral.

24:14.054 --> 24:16.355
Why didn't you?

24:18.025 --> 24:20.592
You.

24:23.364 --> 24:27.265
So why did you move

24:27.267 --> 24:29.434
from Boston in the first place?

24:31.839 --> 24:34.106
I had to.

24:37.077 --> 24:41.246
Are you sure you want to hear this?

24:43.350 --> 24:45.951
Of course.

24:47.654 --> 24:50.288
I'm gonna tell you everything.

24:52.126 --> 24:55.193
Okay.

24:55.195 --> 24:57.696
In that case,

24:57.698 --> 25:01.833
we're-we're gonna
need some more firewood.

25:10.711 --> 25:12.110
(owl hooting)

25:12.112 --> 25:14.646
(indistinct chatter)

25:19.820 --> 25:21.953
MAN: We got plenty of beer.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.456
But if you join, it'll
officially be a party.

25:24.458 --> 25:28.026
CHRISTINA: Oh, no, my boyfriend
and I are fine, thank you.

25:28.028 --> 25:30.762
Where is your boyfriend?

25:30.764 --> 25:33.265
He'll be back any minute.

25:33.267 --> 25:35.133
If you were my girl, I would never

25:35.135 --> 25:37.035
leave you out here like this.

25:37.037 --> 25:39.538
Well, I'm not your girl, am I?

25:42.142 --> 25:44.509
Hey, friend.

25:46.180 --> 25:47.679
Hey.

25:47.681 --> 25:48.814
I was...

25:48.816 --> 25:50.282
I was just inviting

25:50.284 --> 25:52.617
you and your girl to join us

25:52.619 --> 25:53.685
for a drink.

25:53.687 --> 25:56.154
I'm gonna give you a choice.

25:56.156 --> 25:59.024
You can leave right now,

25:59.026 --> 26:02.461
or you can stay.

26:02.463 --> 26:05.163
Why don't you just,

26:05.165 --> 26:06.231
just relax, okay?

26:06.233 --> 26:09.000
Big part of me wants you to stay.

26:10.537 --> 26:13.205
Let's go. Let's go...

26:15.609 --> 26:17.642
What the hell were you doing?

26:17.644 --> 26:19.678
They didn't scare me.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.645
Well, maybe they should've.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.147
You threatened them with a knife!

26:22.149 --> 26:23.582
Yeah, I wanted

26:23.584 --> 26:25.050
to make sure they
left and didn't come back.

26:25.052 --> 26:26.751
Unbelievable.

26:27.621 --> 26:30.222
Stay away from me.

26:34.294 --> 26:36.895
Good morning.

26:37.731 --> 26:40.065
(children chattering)

26:49.510 --> 26:51.943
Hey.

26:51.945 --> 26:53.745
I'm sorry.

26:53.747 --> 26:54.880
Last night...

26:54.882 --> 26:56.948
No, I'm sorry.

26:56.950 --> 27:01.153
I was completely out of
line to bring it up now.

27:01.155 --> 27:03.188
All I want is to be here for you

27:03.190 --> 27:05.624
in whatever way you need.

27:05.626 --> 27:08.226
Thank you.

27:12.666 --> 27:15.433
- What are you drawing?
- A heart.

27:15.435 --> 27:18.136
(phone buzzing)

27:20.841 --> 27:23.408
(indistinct chatter)

27:53.073 --> 27:55.440
We're trying chocolate in...

27:55.442 --> 27:57.609
(children continue chattering)

28:03.984 --> 28:05.917
Honey?

28:05.919 --> 28:07.586
I just realized something.

28:07.588 --> 28:10.155
Buprenorphine and naloxone.

28:10.157 --> 28:12.257
Garrett got it from a
doctor friend of his.

28:12.259 --> 28:14.359
A woman that I think he's dating.

28:14.361 --> 28:15.894
Maybe Garrett's with her right now.

28:15.896 --> 28:19.264
Prescribed by Dr. Christina Morales.

28:19.266 --> 28:21.066
Oh, my God.

28:21.068 --> 28:23.401
What? What are you doing?

28:23.403 --> 28:25.136
- Calling Lieutenant Craig.
- Why?

28:25.138 --> 28:27.272
So he can run by Christina's place
and make sure she's okay.

28:27.274 --> 28:28.306
Why wouldn't she be?

28:28.308 --> 28:29.941
Tess, you don't recognize the name?

28:29.943 --> 28:31.009
No... well, should I?

28:31.011 --> 28:32.277
Christina Morales.

28:32.279 --> 28:33.745
Daughter of David Morales.

28:33.747 --> 28:36.681
- I don't know...
- SBK's final victim, Tess.

28:36.683 --> 28:39.351
Why is Garrett with
her? Why of all people?

28:39.353 --> 28:41.753
Wait, let's check
on Christina ourselves.

28:41.755 --> 28:44.789
I have a feeling if we
find her, we'll find him.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.791
And that's what we both want.

28:50.697 --> 28:52.797
Checkmate.

28:52.799 --> 28:56.001
Can't you just let your old man win?

28:56.003 --> 28:58.837
But if you don't play well,
why should you win the game?

28:58.839 --> 29:02.340
He has a point.

29:02.342 --> 29:04.175
Hiding from the vultures is pretty fun.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.877
What do you want to play next?

29:05.879 --> 29:09.214
Whatever you want.

29:10.884 --> 29:12.917
Big day, huh?

29:12.919 --> 29:15.120
DNA results anytime now.

29:15.122 --> 29:17.222
What are you doing in my home?

29:17.224 --> 29:19.658
I know, I know. So reckless of me,

29:19.660 --> 29:22.027
I could get myself killed.

29:23.797 --> 29:25.964
All this time you've been
sitting in judgment of me.

29:25.966 --> 29:28.166
(clicks tongue) Glass houses, right?

29:35.542 --> 29:38.109
(phone beeping)

29:42.215 --> 29:44.683
(bird cawing)

29:49.189 --> 29:52.824
You texted me.

29:52.826 --> 29:55.894
I thought we should have a little chat.

29:55.896 --> 29:57.896
One-on-one.

29:57.898 --> 30:00.598
This must be hard.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.802
But it's probably good you found out.

30:03.804 --> 30:05.704
Oh, I didn't “find out.”

30:05.706 --> 30:07.806
I've always known.

30:07.808 --> 30:09.574
Alison told me every detail

30:09.576 --> 30:11.509
right down to the silk restraints

30:11.511 --> 30:13.411
you used to tie her to our bed.

30:13.413 --> 30:15.613
- Why would she...?
- It's part of our arrangement.

30:15.615 --> 30:17.449
She can sleep with whoever she wants,

30:17.451 --> 30:20.285
as long as she shares it with me

30:20.287 --> 30:22.587
to spice up our sex life.

30:22.589 --> 30:24.856
Sorry if you thought
it was more than that.

30:24.858 --> 30:27.125
It is more than that.

30:27.127 --> 30:29.894
You know it, and you're scared.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.996
That's what this is about.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.965
Stay away from my wife.

30:33.967 --> 30:35.066
You think she's the type of woman

30:35.068 --> 30:36.101
who's gonna let someone else

30:36.103 --> 30:38.937
dictate what she does?

30:38.939 --> 30:41.406
No wonder you're losing her.

30:48.615 --> 30:50.482
SOPHIE: Hey, it's me.

30:50.484 --> 30:52.717
Yeah, I can't wait.

30:52.719 --> 30:55.353
And I-I don't want to lose it.

30:55.355 --> 30:58.223
Yeah, I promise.

30:58.225 --> 31:00.291
I'll-I'll get you the
money as soon as I can.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.726
I just...

31:01.728 --> 31:05.530
I really need it as soon as possible.

31:14.207 --> 31:16.040
Get out.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.442
What?

31:17.444 --> 31:19.844
I was clean a whole year, and
I fell into the same hole,

31:19.846 --> 31:21.946
and I just can't do it anymore, okay?

31:21.948 --> 31:24.249
I just got through detox,

31:24.251 --> 31:25.950
and there you are right back at it,

31:25.952 --> 31:27.218
on the phone with your dealer.

31:27.220 --> 31:29.154
I was calling a realtor.

31:29.156 --> 31:30.989
I was trying to find us
a new place out of town.

31:30.991 --> 31:32.524
And I did.

31:32.526 --> 31:33.625
What are you talking about?

31:33.627 --> 31:34.692
Down the cape.

31:34.694 --> 31:36.628
Two bedrooms.

31:36.630 --> 31:39.130
Three blocks from the beach.

31:39.132 --> 31:41.833
We could start fresh.

31:41.835 --> 31:44.002
Just the three of us.

31:44.004 --> 31:46.070
Your family always blames
me for your issues.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.539
But let's be honest.

31:47.541 --> 31:49.307
You were using way before I met you.

31:49.309 --> 31:51.176
Because of them.

31:51.178 --> 31:54.712
Because of this place... it's toxic!

31:54.714 --> 31:56.815
So let's get away.

31:56.817 --> 31:59.184
(knocking)

31:59.186 --> 32:00.652
You said you haven't seen her lately?

32:00.654 --> 32:03.354
I just work part-time for the landlord.

32:06.860 --> 32:08.593
Christina?

32:08.595 --> 32:10.161
It's the police.

32:10.163 --> 32:11.863
Are you there?

32:14.835 --> 32:17.435
Okay.

32:29.449 --> 32:32.016
Hello?

32:40.861 --> 32:42.660
No one's home.

32:42.662 --> 32:44.195
I doesn't mean she's in danger, Brady.

32:44.197 --> 32:47.565
Yeah, well, let's just
figure out where she is first, okay?

32:47.567 --> 32:48.733
Where's the dog?

32:48.735 --> 32:51.402
Probably took it with her.

32:55.475 --> 33:00.044
There's a dog sitter here on
her emergency contact list.

33:00.046 --> 33:02.881
Yeah, Christina
dropped Gatsby by last night.

33:02.883 --> 33:06.718
Said she was going
camping with her new boy toy.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.219
Did she say where they were headed?

33:08.221 --> 33:10.922
Uh, Kendall State Park.

33:10.924 --> 33:14.125
Is Christina okay?

33:14.127 --> 33:17.061
I have to let the station
know where Garrett is right away.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.429
Brady, please, no, no.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.765
Tessa, he just fled with the
daughter of an SBK victim

33:20.767 --> 33:23.935
the same day it went public that
DNA had linked a Hawthorne

33:23.937 --> 33:25.737
to the belt used to strangle her father.

33:25.739 --> 33:27.171
Do you think that's coincidence?

33:27.173 --> 33:28.773
DNA's not even back yet.

33:28.775 --> 33:30.909
No one's heard from
Garrett in 24 hours, Tess.

33:30.911 --> 33:32.310
You know how these manhunts go.

33:32.312 --> 33:35.980
He'll never come out...

33:35.982 --> 33:38.316
We've come this far.

33:38.318 --> 33:40.718
Please, let's find him together.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.421
If he is in trouble, I can help.

33:43.423 --> 33:44.422
He will listen to me.

33:44.424 --> 33:46.057
O-Okay, okay.

33:46.059 --> 33:47.825
But if we find him, you
have to let me take the lead.

33:47.827 --> 33:49.761
It's for your safety.

33:49.763 --> 33:50.929
He's my brother.

33:50.931 --> 33:53.598
He's a murder suspect.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.700
I need you to understand that, Tess.

33:55.702 --> 33:57.135
I take the lead.

33:57.137 --> 33:59.103
Okay.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.139
All right, let me call Cutter and cover.

34:01.141 --> 34:02.774
I'll tell her we don't
have any news yet.

34:02.776 --> 34:03.808
(line ringing)

34:03.810 --> 34:05.710
- Oh, damn.
- What? What's wrong?

34:05.712 --> 34:07.178
I left my car keys on
the kitchen counter

34:07.180 --> 34:08.545
in Christina's apartment.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.047
Cutter, it's Ross.

34:10.050 --> 34:12.884
(whispers): I'll grab them.

34:18.692 --> 34:21.225
No.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.099
(line ringing)

34:28.101 --> 34:30.725
This is Brady Ross. Leave a message.

34:30.726 --> 34:32.496
Brady, please don't do this.

34:32.614 --> 34:35.039
Don't do this!

34:42.045 --> 34:44.442
FEMALE VOICE: Please
leave a message after the tone.

34:44.581 --> 34:48.065
Christina, my name is
Detective Brady Ross.

34:48.067 --> 34:52.168
JACK: The vultures are leaving.

34:52.170 --> 34:53.637
Yeah.

34:53.639 --> 34:55.839
But where are they going?

34:55.841 --> 34:58.008
(phone buzzes)

34:58.010 --> 35:00.644
Oh, my God.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.850
Police are on a
full-scale manhunt for this man.

35:06.852 --> 35:09.019
SBK suspect Garrett Hawthorne,

35:09.021 --> 35:11.588
is believed to be hiding somewhere
in Kendall State Park

35:11.590 --> 35:13.090
with an unidentified hostage.

35:13.092 --> 35:16.727
He's considered armed and dangerous.

35:16.729 --> 35:18.362
Told you the police wanted blood.

35:18.364 --> 35:20.898
And now they'll have it.

35:33.946 --> 35:36.947
FEMALE VOICE: You have one new message.

35:36.949 --> 35:39.116
Christina, my name is
Detective Brady Ross.

35:39.118 --> 35:41.385
The man that you're
with, Garrett Hawthorne,

35:41.387 --> 35:43.587
is a suspect in the
Silver Bells murders.

35:43.589 --> 35:46.423
It's crucial that you get away
from him as soon as possible.

35:46.425 --> 35:47.925
GARRETT: Hey.

35:49.895 --> 35:52.896
I thought we said no phone.

35:56.380 --> 35:59.103
MALE REPORTER: Neighborhoods
around Kendall State Park are

35:59.105 --> 36:00.938
on lockdown with residents being advised

36:00.940 --> 36:03.741
to remain indoors until
further notice...

36:03.743 --> 36:05.909
He's with Christina Morales.

36:05.911 --> 36:07.211
I don't know why, but Brady...

36:07.213 --> 36:09.346
Wait, she's the
daughter of an SBK victim.

36:09.348 --> 36:10.647
Brady promised me that

36:10.649 --> 36:11.982
we would find Garrett together,

36:11.984 --> 36:13.250
so that I could talk to him.

36:13.252 --> 36:15.619
But then he drove off without me.

36:15.621 --> 36:16.820
He did the right thing.

36:16.822 --> 36:18.922
How can you say that? Tessa?

36:18.924 --> 36:20.791
It's time to accept the truth.

36:20.793 --> 36:23.093
FEMALE REPORTER: victim
killed back in 2002.

36:23.095 --> 36:25.229
Now, back to our breaking
news story at Kendall State Park.

36:25.231 --> 36:27.698
MALE REPORTER: We've been here
all night where the park rangers

36:27.700 --> 36:30.034
and Boston PD as well
as helicopters have

36:30.036 --> 36:32.136
been searching Kendall
State Park looking

36:32.138 --> 36:34.071
for the SBK suspect Garrett Hawthorne.

36:34.073 --> 36:35.973
Give me the keys to the truck.

36:35.975 --> 36:37.708
Who was that on the phone?

36:39.111 --> 36:40.778
Just give me the car keys.

36:40.780 --> 36:42.212
- Hey, Christina...
- No!

36:42.214 --> 36:43.847
It was you.

36:43.849 --> 36:45.182
You killed my father,

36:45.184 --> 36:46.550
and you brought me here to kill me!

36:46.552 --> 36:47.985
No, I would never hurt you.

36:47.987 --> 36:49.520
Just put the knife down.

36:49.522 --> 36:50.854
The police know who you are.

36:50.856 --> 36:52.623
They're on their way.

36:52.625 --> 36:54.558
Just give me a chance...

36:54.560 --> 36:56.427
Just give me the keys!

36:56.429 --> 36:58.996
Okay.

37:03.936 --> 37:06.403
Drop them on the ground.

37:08.074 --> 37:10.674
Step back.

37:22.388 --> 37:23.954
Christina...

37:25.591 --> 37:28.425
(slicing)

37:36.435 --> 37:37.634
(sighs)

37:37.636 --> 37:39.636
You found my brother?

37:39.638 --> 37:41.004
No.

37:41.006 --> 37:42.673
Not yet.

37:42.675 --> 37:46.343
No, I'm here because we
just got the DNA results.

37:48.347 --> 37:49.913
(siren chirps)

37:49.915 --> 37:51.115
BRADY (over radio): We got him.

37:51.117 --> 37:52.823
Suspect has pulled off to the shoulder.

37:52.988 --> 37:54.485
I'm exiting the
vehicle now to make contact.

37:54.487 --> 37:57.054
(indistinct radio transmission)

37:58.057 --> 37:59.623
Kill the engine!

37:59.625 --> 38:01.391
Open the door.

38:01.393 --> 38:04.361
Exit with your hands in the air.

38:09.602 --> 38:12.236
Garrett, step out now!

38:20.546 --> 38:22.179
Where are you hurt?

38:22.181 --> 38:24.314
Tell me! Tell me where are you hurt?

38:24.316 --> 38:26.750
No... it's not my blood.

38:26.752 --> 38:28.218
(sirens wailing)

38:28.220 --> 38:31.722
It's not my blood.

38:34.560 --> 38:37.594
The blood on the belt is a match

38:37.596 --> 38:39.730
for Mitchell Hawthorne.

38:39.732 --> 38:41.565
No.

38:41.567 --> 38:44.501
You can't make a
match to DNA you don't have.

38:44.503 --> 38:45.836
We do have it.

38:45.838 --> 38:47.371
The trophy case in the hall

38:47.373 --> 38:48.939
displays Dad's jersey

38:48.941 --> 38:50.274
<i>from his most famous game,</i>

38:50.276 --> 38:52.929
<i>when he led the team to
the state championships</i>

38:52.930 --> 38:56.380
<i>even after breaking his
nose in the first quarter.</i>

38:59.151 --> 39:01.118
It was Dad.
