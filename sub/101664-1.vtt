<i>Mayor McHenry
currently faces 12 counts</i>

01:04.423 --> 01:07.192
<i>of corruption for his alleged
embezzlement of county funds</i>

01:07.660 --> 01:10.797
<i>and could face a maximum
of 12 years in state prison.</i>

01:11.296 --> 01:13.231
<i>I guess now we know
who to blame for all those</i>

01:13.331 --> 01:15.935
<i>unfilled potholes around town.</i>

01:16.035 --> 01:18.705
<i>Well, maybe they'll fill up
with snowflakes tonight, right, Stan?</i>

01:18.805 --> 01:21.206
<i>That's right, Todd.</i>

01:21.306 --> 01:23.475
<i>An Alberta clipper system,
a fast moving area</i>

01:23.575 --> 01:26.311
<i>of low pressure is dragging
a cold front our way,</i>

01:26.411 --> 01:28.480
<i>it's drawing moisture up from the south.</i>

01:28.580 --> 01:30.650
<i>We're expecting between
three and six inches</i>

01:30.750 --> 01:32.819
<i>worth of heavy, wet snow</i>

01:32.919 --> 01:34.987
<i>by the time you wake up
for Christmas morning.</i>

01:40.392 --> 01:43.295
<i>Christmas is... a happy time.</i>

01:45.297 --> 01:47.800
<i>Yep, a real happy time.</i>

01:49.635 --> 01:51.436
<i>I'm just saying,
Christmas ain't like it is</i>

01:51.536 --> 01:53.371
<i>in those feel good movies.</i>

01:53.472 --> 01:55.307
<i>Sometimes it could
be like, like...</i>

01:55.407 --> 01:57.275
Ho, ho, ho.

01:57.375 --> 01:58.745
<i>Like a cosmic kick in the dick.</i>

02:00.913 --> 02:02.949
<i>When I was 11,
the local county judge</i>

02:03.049 --> 02:04.416
<i>had a pretty shitty Christmas.</i>

02:05.685 --> 02:07.619
<i>It was all over the news.</i>

02:07.720 --> 02:09.789
<i>The judge comes home
late on Christmas Eve</i>

02:09.889 --> 02:12.759
<i>and there was a hit man
waiting for him in the kitchen.</i>

02:15.527 --> 02:18.430
<i>Could have been worse,
I mean, he lived.</i>

02:18.965 --> 02:21.466
<i>That kind of stuff happens all
the time in East Jesus, Ohio.</i>

02:21.734 --> 02:24.302
<i>We're just a scoot south
of bumblefuck Michigan</i>

02:24.402 --> 02:25.872
<i>on the border of Pensyltucky.</i>

02:25.972 --> 02:28.507
<i>Right square in a county
called trouble.</i>

02:29.075 --> 02:32.044
<i>Some pretty messed up
shit goes on here,</i>

02:32.879 --> 02:35.547
<i>on a daily, like, for reals.</i>

03:06.411 --> 03:07.512
For real?

03:15.420 --> 03:16.388
Sorry.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.500
That'll be all?

04:09.842 --> 04:11.010
It'll be $10.99.

04:25.490 --> 04:26.659
Would you like a bag with that?

04:30.096 --> 04:31.097
Do you have a bathroom?

04:50.850 --> 04:51.884
<i>Dear God...</i>

04:52.818 --> 04:55.888
<i>I know I don't
pray much ever, at all,</i>

04:55.988 --> 04:58.190
<i>but if you really do exist,</i>

04:58.991 --> 05:02.427
<i>if you really
are this all powerful,</i>

05:02.527 --> 05:04.163
<i>all knowing being,</i>

05:04.263 --> 05:07.800
<i>then please, just this once...</i>

05:08.734 --> 05:09.735
<i>help me.</i>

05:09.835 --> 05:11.070
Please, please,

05:11.170 --> 05:13.538
please, please, please, please.

05:19.544 --> 05:21.513
Please, please...

05:21.613 --> 05:23.649
please.

05:34.093 --> 05:35.828
Oh.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.793
Sophia!

06:08.728 --> 06:13.065
Me-a Sophia, you stole my heart

06:13.165 --> 06:16.635
and then I sharded.

06:16.736 --> 06:18.671
- Sophia!
- Oh, my God.

06:19.105 --> 06:20.006
What's you doing?

06:20.873 --> 06:22.574
Walking, what does it look like?

06:22.808 --> 06:24.243
It looks like
you could use a lift.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.644
You could use a car.

06:26.045 --> 06:28.247
Well, I got
my driver's permit last week

06:28.347 --> 06:29.882
and I've been
delivering papers, so...

06:30.750 --> 06:32.885
my uncle's Sunfire
will be mine in no time.

06:32.985 --> 06:34.153
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

06:35.121 --> 06:38.791
By then I bet you could use
a ride but I might be too busy.

06:38.891 --> 06:40.826
I thought you were in love with me?

06:40.926 --> 06:42.594
Now you're going to be too busy.

06:42.695 --> 06:45.297
I was in love in you,
that was last year.

06:45.398 --> 06:47.933
Plus, I heard you're
with Trey Davis now.

06:48.034 --> 06:49.969
We broke up. Kind of.

06:50.936 --> 06:53.239
- I figured.
- What's that suppose to mean?

06:53.739 --> 06:57.109
Well, when I was coming here,
I passed Madison Fatchek's house

06:57.209 --> 06:59.912
and as soon as her dad
leaves, I see him walk in.

07:00.346 --> 07:01.781
Fatchick, Fatchek?

07:01.881 --> 07:03.215
She's not so fat anymore.

07:04.016 --> 07:06.218
I heard she got
her stomach stapled.

07:07.153 --> 07:09.288
Jimmy Stam says that
she's anorexic.

07:09.388 --> 07:10.990
She's probably bulimic.

07:11.090 --> 07:13.893
Those titties, still fat though.

07:16.929 --> 07:18.631
You're so gross!

07:18.731 --> 07:19.965
Just saying.

07:20.066 --> 07:21.566
Isn't her dad a cop?

07:21.667 --> 07:24.203
He's a detective and Jimmy Stam

07:24.303 --> 07:26.806
told me that she helps
her cousin sell weed

07:26.906 --> 07:28.274
and he doesn't detect shit.

07:28.741 --> 07:30.209
That must be where Trey's
been getting faded.

07:32.144 --> 07:33.312
He's probably getting
more than just weed.

07:35.347 --> 07:37.149
- Stop.
- What?

07:37.683 --> 07:38.583
Your shoe's untied.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.287
The stupid thing
keeps coming undone.

07:44.857 --> 07:45.991
You should double knot it.

07:46.092 --> 07:47.093
You should hold on.

- Hi, Sophia.
- Hi, Sophia.

09:09.041 --> 09:11.744
So when does
your stepdad go to work?

09:12.077 --> 09:13.879
- He got fired.
- Again?

09:13.979 --> 09:15.214
I know. Right?

09:18.450 --> 09:19.685
What are you doing tonight?

09:20.853 --> 09:23.055
- I don't know.
- My parents are going to the casino

09:23.155 --> 09:24.757
and I know where
they keep their booze

09:24.857 --> 09:27.426
if you want to go back to
my place and Netflix and chill.

09:28.027 --> 09:30.462
- I can't.
- Yeah, right, whatever.

09:31.463 --> 09:32.331
Noah.

09:33.399 --> 09:34.266
Noah!

09:40.973 --> 09:42.274
Why don't you
cook dinner for once?

09:42.374 --> 09:43.442
Because I don't want to.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.077
Why don't you
get off my nutsack?

09:45.177 --> 09:46.412
You are such a prick.

09:47.647 --> 09:49.782
- You want me to turn off the power again?
- Woman, please.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.984
How many times we have to
go through this, Rayjon?

09:52.084 --> 09:55.387
We need to save money, get that
through your freaking skull.

09:55.487 --> 09:57.790
Yeah, and how much that outfit
cost at Penny's yesterday?

09:57.890 --> 09:59.358
- I got that for work.
- Sure you did.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.260
You really think it cost
more than those golf clubs

10:01.360 --> 10:02.728
you got out in the garage?

10:03.395 --> 10:04.997
Again with the golf clubs.

10:05.097 --> 10:07.299
What'd you think, you were
Tiger Woods or something?

10:07.399 --> 10:09.735
You're going to sell those
things tomorrow, you hear me?

10:09.835 --> 10:10.736
No, I ain't.

10:10.836 --> 10:12.171
If you don't then I will.

10:12.271 --> 10:14.006
Go to work, Theresa.

10:14.106 --> 10:16.275
At least I got a job,
you freaking deadbeat.

10:18.544 --> 10:20.379
What did you say?

10:23.249 --> 10:26.151
Eat... a... dick.

10:28.153 --> 10:29.255
That's got
a good beat to it, right?

10:29.355 --> 10:31.423
Real mature,
say it a little louder

10:31.523 --> 10:32.358
so the kids can hear you.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.963
Eat a dick, eat a dick,
take a big old bite,

10:38.063 --> 10:39.164
or a little lick.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.133
I should record that
right there.

10:49.408 --> 10:50.943
<i>We've all had a shitty Christmas</i>

10:51.043 --> 10:53.078
<i>at one time or another, right?</i>

11:01.086 --> 11:03.422
<i>Like, when I was four years old</i>

11:04.023 --> 11:07.793
<i>my dumbass daddy robbed
a Quick Mart twice.</i>

11:08.894 --> 11:11.797
<i>Ask my mom about that Christmas,
and all she'll say</i>

11:11.897 --> 11:14.566
<i>is, "He didn't get me
nothing that year."</i>

11:14.668 --> 11:16.468
Why are you bitching at me?

11:16.568 --> 11:19.471
Because you didn't get me
nothing for Christmas this year,

11:19.571 --> 11:21.006
you cheap son of a bitch.

11:21.540 --> 11:25.544
- Wait, what time is it?
- It's 11:53.

11:25.645 --> 11:28.347
Well, it ain't
Christmas morning yet.

11:30.449 --> 11:32.017
Where you going?

11:32.117 --> 11:33.819
The night is young, Theresa.

11:33.919 --> 11:35.321
The night is not young,

11:35.421 --> 11:37.056
it's Christmas freaking Eve.

11:37.156 --> 11:40.092
You can't get nothing now,
every where's closed.

11:40.592 --> 11:42.361
We'll see about that.

11:50.302 --> 11:54.306
- Nefantarter, holy shit, is that you?
- Yeah.

11:54.406 --> 11:57.209
You look good, man,
like you've been lifting.

11:57.309 --> 11:59.078
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

11:59.178 --> 12:02.348
You need anything, man,
I got ups and downs,

12:02.448 --> 12:05.984
- and loopty-loos.
- No, thanks, man.

12:06.085 --> 12:08.120
I told you I'm good.

12:08.220 --> 12:11.190
Been clean for two years.
You ain't noticed?

12:11.290 --> 12:15.127
Two... two years, it's been
that long, holy shit, man,

12:15.227 --> 12:20.165
I remember when you were
everyday, twice a day.

12:20.265 --> 12:22.067
Yeah, not anymore.

12:22.501 --> 12:25.504
Hey, hey, didn't you
go to jail or some shit

12:25.604 --> 12:27.106
for leaving your kid in the car

12:27.206 --> 12:30.042
while you were getting
a handy at the Rub & Tug?

12:31.343 --> 12:33.879
Yeah, I was all doped out

12:33.979 --> 12:35.881
on that crystal blue
shit back then.

12:36.448 --> 12:39.418
Oh, yeah, crystal blue.

12:39.518 --> 12:42.020
I got that
crystal blue shit, man.

12:44.056 --> 12:45.290
Not anymore.

12:56.034 --> 13:00.439
I know what you like, mama,
you like that white chocolate.

13:05.010 --> 13:08.280
- $1.87.
- $1.87?

13:08.380 --> 13:12.084
- Yes.
- Uh, that's a bit steep, ain't it?

13:12.184 --> 13:16.188
- Tax.
- Yeah, yeah, tax my ass.

13:16.723 --> 13:19.391
Shit, I forgot my wallet.

13:21.994 --> 13:24.430
I'll tell you what, you pay me.

13:25.297 --> 13:27.634
- What?
- You pay me.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.935
Come on, open the register.

13:33.439 --> 13:36.275
Open the register.

13:39.211 --> 13:42.581
Next time you should, uh,
catch it with your hands, not your face.

13:44.016 --> 13:45.951
Come on, come on,
underneath too.

13:46.653 --> 13:49.955
Holy Christmas tits!

13:50.055 --> 13:51.290
Is this for me?

13:51.390 --> 13:53.325
Be a good little elf

13:53.425 --> 13:55.127
and put it all in Santa's sack.

13:56.094 --> 13:57.129
Uh-uh.

13:59.331 --> 14:03.001
Hey, uh, sorry about your eye.

14:15.481 --> 14:17.015
<i>My daddy took all that money,</i>

14:17.616 --> 14:19.117
<i>and put it straight in his arm.</i>

14:20.385 --> 14:22.387
Oh, shit.

14:33.766 --> 14:36.502
Ah. I forgot the goddamn candy.

14:41.774 --> 14:43.575
And I tell him, don't
you ever come back here,

14:43.676 --> 14:46.044
or I'll kick your
shitty little ass, punk.

14:50.817 --> 14:54.353
I forgot my candy
bar, but since I'm here,

14:54.453 --> 14:58.524
why don't you do me a favor
and give me your wallet?

14:58.624 --> 15:01.426
Please, sir, you've
already robbed us once.

15:01.861 --> 15:05.330
No, I already robbed him.

15:10.235 --> 15:11.738
Damn.

15:12.337 --> 15:14.273
I'm sorry,
none of you guys can catch,

15:14.373 --> 15:16.441
that's too bad.

15:18.878 --> 15:22.447
Merry Christmas, fellas.

15:43.670 --> 15:47.139
Oh, oh, there it is, oh, oh.

15:54.681 --> 15:56.849
You cheap son of a bitch.

15:56.950 --> 15:57.817
Theresa.

15:58.685 --> 15:59.418
You didn't get me nothing

15:59.986 --> 16:00.653
for Christmas this year.

16:01.353 --> 16:02.120
Uh, that's not true.

16:03.522 --> 16:06.291
I, I got you
your favorite candy bar.

16:08.628 --> 16:10.730
Eat it, Daddy.

16:25.678 --> 16:26.679
I want candy.

16:31.216 --> 16:32.819
Oh. Oh!

16:32.919 --> 16:35.554
- What kind are you going to get?
- Peanut butter.

16:36.388 --> 16:37.489
I'm going to get caramel.

16:37.589 --> 16:39.458
You should try
the white chocolate.

16:39.558 --> 16:42.327
Mm. It's delicious.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.672

Oh, who you calling nuub?

17:21.400 --> 17:23.235
I'll smoke all you all fools.

17:23.636 --> 17:25.570
Okay, nuub, whatever you say.

17:28.473 --> 17:29.776
Oh, he's dead, get him, get him.

17:29.876 --> 17:30.810
Man, shut up.

17:32.511 --> 17:35.180
- He sucks.
- You all think you all are bad?

17:35.280 --> 17:36.916
I ought to kick both of
your asses when I see you all.

17:37.016 --> 17:38.316
You best believe that.

17:39.351 --> 17:39.819
Come on, boys,
let's go to the mall.

17:40.753 --> 17:42.421
Who wants to see Santa?

17:44.623 --> 17:47.592
Yay!

17:55.968 --> 17:57.970
What?

17:58.071 --> 18:00.372
- Sophia.
- Go away!

18:01.306 --> 18:02.842
Is everything
all right, sweetie?

18:05.277 --> 18:06.946
You have to work
on Christmas Eve?

18:07.046 --> 18:09.614
Yeah, we're doing
inventory today.

18:10.016 --> 18:11.818
I could use the extra hours.

18:12.551 --> 18:14.252
I'll be home by 11, don't worry.

18:15.287 --> 18:17.824
Just makes sure dickhead downstairs
cooks something for dinner.

18:19.591 --> 18:20.927
- Did you hear me?
- Yes!

18:22.527 --> 18:24.229
You don't mind
if I borrow these, do you?

18:24.864 --> 18:26.331
I'll give them back, I swear.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.602
What's the matter, is it Trey?

18:31.603 --> 18:32.471
What did he do now?

18:32.571 --> 18:34.006
Mind your own business.

18:34.741 --> 18:36.642
I was a teenager
once too, you know?

18:37.609 --> 18:38.644
Until I got pregnant.

18:39.411 --> 18:40.913
Anyways, been there done that.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.547
I'm always here
if you need to talk.

18:43.716 --> 18:46.318
- Mom.
- Oh, no, I can't right now, honey, I got to go.

18:47.352 --> 18:49.454
Do me a favor though, stop by
and see your grandparents today.

18:49.756 --> 18:52.457
- Do I have to?
- Yes, you have to.

18:52.959 --> 18:55.494
- Why?
- Because they're old,

18:55.594 --> 18:57.295
and they live,
like, five blocks away

18:57.395 --> 18:58.664
and they're probably
going to die soon.

18:59.766 --> 19:01.667
- And because I said so.
- Whatever!

19:01.768 --> 19:03.268
You don't think Grandma
could use the extra help.

19:03.736 --> 19:05.037
Malecia was supposed
to come over.

19:05.638 --> 19:07.907
So go later,
they'd love to see you.

19:08.007 --> 19:10.009
Fine, I'll go
but it's total bullshit.

19:10.109 --> 19:13.445
- Sophia Hendrix, so help me, God.
- That is not my name.

19:13.545 --> 19:15.982
Girl, sometimes I swear you act
like a spoiled little twat.

19:16.682 --> 19:18.350
If you want to keep
your daddy's last name

19:18.450 --> 19:20.820
and be known as the daughter
as an OD'd smack addict,

19:20.920 --> 19:23.388
go ahead but don't come
crying to me again

19:23.488 --> 19:24.791
when they start
bullying you in school.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.794
Great, now I'm really
going to be late.

19:28.393 --> 19:29.327
Can I use this?

19:31.731 --> 19:32.665
I love you, sweetie.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.650
Hey, I remember you,
you live on Easy Street, right?

19:51.651 --> 19:53.085
Your mama like jewelry?

19:53.186 --> 19:54.854
She got any diamonds?

19:55.453 --> 19:58.024
Hey, where
the hoe, hoe, hoes at?

19:58.124 --> 20:00.458
How about I take you
home with me tonight?

20:00.559 --> 20:02.094
Could be my elf on the shelf.

20:02.895 --> 20:03.930
No, thanks.

20:04.462 --> 20:05.932
You ain't even my type.

20:15.975 --> 20:17.710
Okay, everybody,
let's take a little break.

20:20.746 --> 20:23.049
I'm sorry, folks, I just
need a word with old St. Nick.

20:23.983 --> 20:25.350
We'll be open in ten minutes.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.486
It's bad enough you show up
three sheets to the wind.

20:28.587 --> 20:31.590
You smell like you parked your
sleigh up Rudolph's rotten asshole,

20:31.691 --> 20:34.961
and you definitely can't smoke
the wacky tobacy here,

20:35.995 --> 20:37.063
not in my mall.

20:41.067 --> 20:42.467
You got something to say to me?

20:44.971 --> 20:46.973

22:08.921 --> 22:10.622
Hi, Mr. Hendricks,
is Sophia home?

22:13.225 --> 22:14.160
Yeah, she upstairs.

22:15.861 --> 22:17.029
Hi, Malecia.

22:19.597 --> 22:23.069
Oh, what now, sucker?

22:23.169 --> 22:24.637
Wait, that's not fair.

22:24.737 --> 22:26.072
Who is it?

22:26.172 --> 22:27.673
It's me, open up.

22:32.544 --> 22:34.612
Thank you so
much for coming over.

22:34.714 --> 22:36.481
Anything for my BFF.

22:43.823 --> 22:46.624
Oh, God, your stepbrother
is such a freak.

22:47.193 --> 22:48.560
Why, what'd he do now?

22:48.995 --> 22:51.063
Notta, boy's just whack.

22:52.231 --> 22:55.267
You have no idea, he sits
down there playing games

22:55.368 --> 22:58.570
all day because
he has, like, zero friends.

22:58.671 --> 23:00.139
What about the little boy
from down the street,

23:00.239 --> 23:02.008
uh... Franki, what's his face?

23:02.108 --> 23:03.642
Oh, RJ kicked
the crap out of him,

23:03.743 --> 23:05.878
so now Mrs. Baylaw won't
let him come over anymore.

23:05.978 --> 23:07.279
The boy's, like, ten years old.

23:07.380 --> 23:09.148
- Yep.
- With asthma.

23:09.915 --> 23:12.151
RJ gets picked on by all
the kids in his own grade,

23:12.251 --> 23:15.287
so he pays that forward by
bullying anyone weaker than him.

23:15.388 --> 23:16.922
Freakshow.

23:17.256 --> 23:20.159
In other news,
so what's up with Sophia?

23:21.227 --> 23:22.828
I'm pregnant.

23:23.062 --> 23:24.764
Shut up, are you serious?

23:25.597 --> 23:28.200
Oh, that's wild,
do you know who's it is?

23:28.300 --> 23:31.170
Of course I know
who's it is, it's Trey's!

23:31.771 --> 23:33.538
- Oh.
- What?

23:34.073 --> 23:36.208
- Nothing.
- No, tell me, what?

23:36.308 --> 23:39.544
It's like I heard
he was with Fatchick now.

23:39.645 --> 23:41.579
No, he just gets
weed off of her.

23:41.680 --> 23:42.782
That's not what I heard.

23:42.882 --> 23:44.850
Can we focus
on the problem here?

23:44.950 --> 23:47.552
- What's that?
- The baby, Malecia, the baby!

23:47.653 --> 23:49.955
- Oh, gee, relax.
- Relax?

23:50.056 --> 23:53.826
I cannot relax.
My mom is going to kill me.

23:53.926 --> 23:55.795
My whole life is over!

23:55.895 --> 23:57.663
I'm going to have
to drop out of school.

23:57.763 --> 24:01.100
I'm going to have to get,
like, a job for diapers.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.302
No, you won't,
that's what welfare's for.

24:03.836 --> 24:04.904
What?

24:05.004 --> 24:07.673
I'm going to get so fat!

24:07.773 --> 24:09.341
Well, look at the bright side,

24:09.442 --> 24:11.343
if Trey's into Madison Fatchek,

24:11.944 --> 24:14.280
maybe he likes a little
extra cushion for the pushing.

24:14.380 --> 24:16.282
Ow, sorry.

24:17.850 --> 24:19.118
He's not with Fatchek.

24:20.386 --> 24:23.122
Besides, heard she lost, like,
a lot of weight or something.

24:23.222 --> 24:24.990
Oh, I have an idea.

24:26.258 --> 24:28.360
- Well, spit it out.
- Girl, that's what you should have done.

24:29.695 --> 24:31.596
Ow, sorry.

24:33.032 --> 24:35.901
You could get an abortion.

24:37.069 --> 24:39.071
You mean, like, kill it?

24:39.171 --> 24:41.340
You can't kill something that's
not been born yet, can you?

24:42.308 --> 24:46.045
I mean, I guess not.
Is that even legal?

24:46.145 --> 24:48.881
Of course it's legal, it's been
legal since, like, the '80's.

24:49.248 --> 24:51.317
Haven't you ever heard
of a woman's right to choose?

24:52.184 --> 24:54.019
I thought it was choosing
the name or something.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.123
No, dummy,
that means you can choose

24:57.223 --> 24:59.959
to keep it or...

25:01.794 --> 25:03.963
- So my mom would never know?
- Nope.

25:04.063 --> 25:05.297
Nobody ever has to know.

25:05.998 --> 25:07.633
Here, let's search it.

25:09.301 --> 25:13.772
Ohio abortions... got it.

25:14.206 --> 25:16.075
Well, what's it say?

25:17.343 --> 25:18.244
Uh...

25:21.947 --> 25:25.784
A parent must consent
before a minor gets an abortion.

25:26.785 --> 25:28.387
My life is so over.

25:30.222 --> 25:31.757
Want to go get pizza?

25:32.424 --> 25:34.226
Go grab me another
six pack out the fridge.

25:37.997 --> 25:40.266
- Can I get one?
- Yeah, no.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.808
- Where you all going?
- Out.

25:49.909 --> 25:50.910
You got to babysit
the boys next door.

25:51.010 --> 25:53.412
- Uh, no one told me that.
- Yeah, the neighbor lady

25:53.512 --> 25:55.080
came over this morning,
asked if you could watch them

25:55.181 --> 25:57.116
while she do some
last minute Christmas shopping.

25:57.216 --> 25:59.251
- So I told her, all right.
- Well, I can't.

25:59.351 --> 26:01.754
Your mom going to be heated
when she find out.

26:01.854 --> 26:04.990
- You know we need that scrilla.
- Sorry, not sorry.

26:07.760 --> 26:08.761
Malecia!

26:09.962 --> 26:10.963
I can babysit.

26:11.430 --> 26:13.265
You?

26:22.341 --> 26:24.777
- So when did it happen?
- What?

26:26.378 --> 26:28.047
Oh, oh!

26:28.147 --> 26:30.816
- Oh, yeah.
- On Thanksgiving.

26:30.916 --> 26:33.152
Get out, he stuffed you
up on turkey day?

26:35.888 --> 26:37.423
Was it at his house or yours?

26:37.523 --> 26:40.125
He actually got in a huge fight
with his parents that night,

26:40.793 --> 26:44.129
had nowhere to go to eat so
I invited him over to join us.

26:44.230 --> 26:45.798
Oh, you're too sweet.

26:46.198 --> 26:47.466
It actually happened in his car.

26:50.302 --> 26:53.005
<i>Next thing I knew
we were just doing it.</i>

26:53.839 --> 26:55.007
<i>How'd you get pregnant?</i>

26:55.107 --> 26:56.342
Uh, last time I checked

26:56.442 --> 26:58.344
there's only one way
to get pregnant.

26:58.444 --> 27:01.013
- Didn't he use a condom?
- Yeah, at first.

27:01.380 --> 27:02.481
Then it kept getting...

27:05.150 --> 27:07.052
- soft.
- The condom?

27:07.152 --> 27:08.187
No, him!

27:08.287 --> 27:09.388
So he had to take it off.

27:10.155 --> 27:11.323
Oh.

27:22.067 --> 27:24.370
- Sophia!
- Oh, no.

27:26.205 --> 27:30.209
I waited for my period,
it just never came.

27:33.912 --> 27:35.814
- No way!
- What!

27:36.081 --> 27:39.018
It's my mom, she says
someone broke into the house.

27:39.118 --> 27:41.487
- Really?
- Sorry, bae, got to go.

27:46.225 --> 27:49.395
Stay strong, girl,
you'll figure it out. Hundo p.

27:52.364 --> 27:54.867
Oh, hell no,
they took our presents.

28:09.315 --> 28:14.253
Sophia, won't you
ride with me-a?

28:14.353 --> 28:15.521
Are you stalking me?

28:16.188 --> 28:17.456
You wish I was stalking you.

28:17.556 --> 28:19.124
So you're not stalking me?

28:19.224 --> 28:20.959
No, I'm, uh,
I'm on my way to Walmart.

28:21.060 --> 28:22.328
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

28:22.428 --> 28:24.997
- Walmart's that way.
- Oh, I mean, uh,

28:25.097 --> 28:26.265
I mean, I'm coming
back from Walmart.

28:26.365 --> 28:28.067
Oh. What'd you get?

28:28.167 --> 28:32.037
I, uh, I shoplifted this gum,
you want a piece?

28:32.471 --> 28:34.406
- You stole this?
- Maybe,

28:34.506 --> 28:36.342
would that turn you on?

28:37.176 --> 28:38.610
I mean, that's why you're
with Trey, right,

28:38.712 --> 28:39.945
you like criminals.

28:40.312 --> 28:41.180
No.

28:42.181 --> 28:44.049
Huh. I just figured it
probably made you wet

28:44.149 --> 28:45.250
every time he talks about juvie.

28:45.351 --> 28:47.186
Ew.

28:49.054 --> 28:51.323
He's 18 now, so no more juvie.

28:51.423 --> 28:53.158
You know that's
so statutory right?

28:53.258 --> 28:54.893
- Shut up!
- I'm just saying.

28:58.130 --> 29:00.532
- So why him?
- Why not?

29:01.133 --> 29:02.368
Because he's a complete tool.

29:02.468 --> 29:04.570
- You're a tool!
- Good one.

29:05.471 --> 29:06.972
Why do you think he's a tool?

29:07.506 --> 29:08.907
Where do I even start?

29:10.008 --> 29:12.544
Jimmy Stam told me his real name
is Edward Davis III.

29:12.645 --> 29:14.647
He just calls himself
Trey to sound black.

29:15.247 --> 29:18.517
He acts like he's all hood and
gangster, he's country as shit.

29:18.617 --> 29:21.620
His dad's
the fishing warden, real hood.

29:23.255 --> 29:25.290
And plus isn't he
supposed to be a senior?

29:25.391 --> 29:27.226
He's failed
three years in a row.

29:28.327 --> 29:31.430
He's a liar, he's an asshole
and he's a scumbag.

29:31.964 --> 29:33.532
I bet he's cheating
on you right now.

29:34.299 --> 29:36.435
People like him need
to be put in their place.

29:38.237 --> 29:41.073
Okay, psycho, let's go.

29:41.173 --> 29:43.342
- Where are we going?
- Madison Fatchek's house.

29:43.442 --> 29:46.378
- Okey dokey, pretty lady.
- You're such a dork.

30:14.473 --> 30:16.108
Oh, look at these losers.

30:16.208 --> 30:18.177
Isn't that Trey's little slut?

30:18.678 --> 30:20.579
Hey, watch this.

30:27.252 --> 30:28.153
Fags!

30:32.558 --> 30:33.959
Assholes.

30:34.359 --> 30:36.195
I think those were Trey's friends.

30:46.405 --> 30:48.507
- That's his whip, right?
- Yeah.

30:49.408 --> 30:50.643
He probably stole it.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.702
I told you so.

31:15.802 --> 31:17.069
He's just smoking some weed,

31:17.169 --> 31:18.270
it isn't even
that big of a deal.

31:41.794 --> 31:43.028
Oh, snap!

31:43.630 --> 31:45.030
- Busted.
- Oh.

31:46.532 --> 31:47.634
Seriously?

31:50.737 --> 31:52.170
Let's go!

31:57.175 --> 31:59.478
Sophia,
it's not what it looks like!

31:59.578 --> 32:00.813
You lied to me!

32:00.914 --> 32:03.081
I'm sorry, shawty,
my head's all messed up,

32:03.181 --> 32:04.416
I don't even know
what's going on.

32:04.516 --> 32:05.617
Let that bitch go, Trey.

32:05.718 --> 32:07.553
Who you calling a bitch, skank?

32:07.654 --> 32:09.756
Tell her you're with
a real woman now.

32:09.856 --> 32:11.156
Shut up, skank.

32:12.157 --> 32:13.258
Sophia.

32:13.693 --> 32:16.061
Okay, hoe, you gots to go.

32:16.161 --> 32:18.430
I'm about to pop you
like a cherry on prom night.

32:24.202 --> 32:25.203
Whoa!

32:31.711 --> 32:34.313
Damn!

32:34.413 --> 32:36.849
Oh.

32:38.317 --> 32:40.853
- Are you getting that?
- Yep.

32:42.287 --> 32:43.155
Oh, man.

32:58.503 --> 33:00.472
- All right.
- Hell yeah!

33:09.247 --> 33:10.783
Are you going to
help me up or what?

33:12.484 --> 33:13.686
Hey, give me my shirt back.

33:16.956 --> 33:18.323
Sophia, wait!

33:22.829 --> 33:24.396
What are you looking at?

33:24.496 --> 33:27.867
This one's going on YouTube!

33:52.324 --> 33:54.593
- You okay?
- No.

33:55.327 --> 33:57.462
Well, look,
my offer still stands,

33:57.562 --> 33:59.598
nothing's better for a heartache
than a horror movie,

33:59.699 --> 34:02.200
a bottle of 151 and some
Sprite to chase it down.

34:02.802 --> 34:05.437
There's actually this flick
called, <i>Silent Night, Deadly Night</i>

34:05.537 --> 34:07.239
- about a deranged...
- I can't.

34:07.774 --> 34:09.207
Well, if Santa's not your thing,

34:09.307 --> 34:10.810
there's always
<i>Killer Klowns from Outer Space.</i>

34:10.910 --> 34:12.611
No, I can't come over.

34:13.980 --> 34:15.648
Don't tell me
it's because of Trey,

34:15.748 --> 34:17.850
he's cheating on you,
you saw it with your own eyes.

34:18.785 --> 34:20.753
There's two types
of men in this world,

34:20.853 --> 34:22.287
and he's neither of them.

34:23.723 --> 34:28.293
You're smart, you're fun, you're
beautiful, you're perfect.

34:29.729 --> 34:30.663
Stop.

34:31.898 --> 34:32.765
What?

34:33.933 --> 34:34.934
I'm...

34:35.902 --> 34:37.637
Let me guess, you're
still in love with him?

34:38.336 --> 34:39.438
I give up.

34:39.906 --> 34:41.206
Noah.

34:42.842 --> 34:44.409
I'm pregnant!

34:45.645 --> 34:46.846
With his?

34:49.816 --> 34:51.651
I guess I was wrong
about you, Sophia,

34:51.751 --> 34:53.351
you're not
as smart as I thought.

34:54.519 --> 34:55.387
Good luck.

34:56.189 --> 34:57.757
- What?
- You're going to need it.

35:02.995 --> 35:04.897
He spit on us!

35:24.951 --> 35:26.251
What's wrong with you?

35:43.568 --> 35:45.403
Hey.

35:46.873 --> 35:48.340
You all right?

35:49.108 --> 35:51.476
You need to talk?

35:51.978 --> 35:53.478
Is this about that white boy

35:53.578 --> 35:55.047
that thinks of himself
as a brother?

35:55.882 --> 35:57.616
You just let me know,

35:57.717 --> 36:00.418
I've been waiting months to slap
the black out of his mouth.

36:01.654 --> 36:04.523
Or if it's a womanly issue,

36:05.057 --> 36:07.026
your mom
won't be back for awhile,

36:07.126 --> 36:08.795
but you can always
go to your Grandma's.

36:09.528 --> 36:12.531
- Just go away!
- Okay.

36:12.632 --> 36:15.001
I'm just trying to help, God.

36:22.108 --> 36:24.309
How long you going to be in there?

36:25.577 --> 36:27.512
I got to take a shit!

37:05.584 --> 37:07.619
- Get off my porch.
- Grandpa.

37:08.020 --> 37:11.123
- I will shoot.
- Grandpa, it's me, Sophia.

37:11.657 --> 37:13.693
- Who?
- Your granddaughter!

37:14.559 --> 37:16.762
Oh, yeah.

37:16.863 --> 37:19.765
- Come on in, sweetie pie.
- Okay.

37:43.923 --> 37:46.458
Go on, take a seat, sit down.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.461
What happened to your eye?

37:52.564 --> 37:55.400
- What's that?
- Your eye, what happened?

37:55.735 --> 37:58.436
That ain't nothing, I'm fine.

38:12.517 --> 38:14.486
I'm sorry, where are my manners,

38:14.586 --> 38:17.622
would you like something
to drink some milk or pop?

38:17.924 --> 38:19.025
No, thanks.

38:19.659 --> 38:21.861
- You want to cookie?
- No, I'm good.

38:21.961 --> 38:23.029
Well, suit yourself.

38:27.233 --> 38:28.134
Where's Grandma at?

38:50.156 --> 38:51.791
We just don't want
any trouble here, ma'am.

39:03.769 --> 39:06.172
- You worthless piece of garbage!
- Hey!

39:06.272 --> 39:09.709
- Ow!
- Settle down.

39:11.210 --> 39:14.180
Okay, that was against the law.

39:22.755 --> 39:24.790
Oh, who gives a shit.

39:24.890 --> 39:26.624
I was just hoping
to talk to her.

39:27.026 --> 39:29.494
Why, you have
a bad day at school?

39:29.962 --> 39:32.231
Oh, there's no school today,
it's Christmas Eve.

39:32.898 --> 39:34.033
Oh, yeah.

39:35.234 --> 39:37.569
I knew that.

39:38.871 --> 39:40.572
Can I ask you
a question, Grandpa?

39:41.774 --> 39:43.242
Shoot, kiddo.

39:43.943 --> 39:46.078
Why did you and Grandma
stop after Mom came along?

39:46.912 --> 39:49.048
Like, why didn't you guys
have any more kids?

39:56.088 --> 39:58.090
- We did.
- What?

39:59.591 --> 40:00.659
Your mama...

40:02.328 --> 40:04.296
she was actually
our second child.

40:05.798 --> 40:08.768
She's got an older sister
out there somewhere.

40:09.735 --> 40:10.736
What?

40:13.939 --> 40:14.974
You know what,

40:15.975 --> 40:18.144
your grandma would fry
my balls for breakfast

40:18.244 --> 40:21.947
if she knew I was going to tell you
this, but guess what, kiddy...

40:23.382 --> 40:25.651
want you get to my age
you start passing secrets

40:25.751 --> 40:27.619
like you pass gas.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.155
Oh, Grandpa.

40:30.890 --> 40:32.825
It's milk.

40:33.625 --> 40:34.827
So what happened to her?

40:37.029 --> 40:39.331
- Who's that?
- Mom's sister.

40:44.103 --> 40:45.971
You know that story about how

40:46.072 --> 40:47.940
me and your Grandma met,
don't you?

40:48.040 --> 40:50.109
Yeah, at a Cleveland Indians
game, right?

40:50.209 --> 40:53.813
We didn't meet
at no Indians game,

40:53.913 --> 40:55.981
that was just a,
just a bunch of hog wash

40:56.082 --> 40:57.615
your grandma told everyone.

40:58.350 --> 41:01.053
Christ, we, we met at a church.

41:01.153 --> 41:03.022
You and Grandma went to church?

41:03.122 --> 41:06.225
Hell yes,
we went in to church.

41:08.327 --> 41:11.931
That was damn near 50 years ago.

41:17.670 --> 41:21.073
<i>You see your grandma
was real religious back then.</i>

41:22.374 --> 41:25.010
<i>I attended
on a regular basis, though</i>

41:25.111 --> 41:27.780
<i>I wasn't much
for the singing and dancing</i>

41:28.681 --> 41:29.782
<i>till I met her.</i>

41:30.916 --> 41:35.121
<i>From that moment on
there was no getting between us.</i>

41:39.825 --> 41:41.026
Good Lord!

41:41.127 --> 41:45.831
Oh, my God, oh, oh,
oh, my God, oh, oh,

41:45.931 --> 41:49.168
amen, oh, amen, oh, my God!

41:50.102 --> 41:51.804
Long story short...

41:53.439 --> 41:54.707
I put a bun in her over.

41:56.041 --> 41:59.745
And after a few months,
that baby girl was upon us.

42:02.348 --> 42:04.250
So we put her up for adoption.

42:05.050 --> 42:06.051
Why?

42:06.152 --> 42:08.320
Well, I didn't have a job,

42:08.420 --> 42:11.090
we had no way
to support her and it's...

42:13.192 --> 42:16.262
sometimes life only gives you
one choice in the moment.

42:18.164 --> 42:20.699
I always hoped that
she had a good life,

42:20.799 --> 42:22.868
she, she found a good family

42:22.968 --> 42:25.404
that loved her
and took care of her.

42:28.307 --> 42:30.976
Anyway, Grandma and me,
we moved on.

42:32.912 --> 42:36.015
After a few years,
I got a job at the mill.

42:36.415 --> 42:39.885
We built a house
and we started trying again.

42:40.486 --> 42:42.254
That's when your mama came along

42:42.354 --> 42:45.824
and believe me, with all the
spit and vinegar in her veins,

42:46.292 --> 42:48.861
one was enough.

42:48.961 --> 42:49.795
Wow.

42:50.396 --> 42:51.463
Yeah.

42:52.698 --> 42:56.335
Funny thing is we, we ain't
never been back to church since.

42:57.469 --> 43:00.239
So I bought myself
a wedding coat

43:00.339 --> 43:02.241
and I met her at the courthouse.

43:03.876 --> 43:06.011
- And that was that.
- Yeah.

43:07.046 --> 43:09.481
And that, sweetie pie, was that.

43:12.051 --> 43:15.321
Son of a bitch,
what time is it?

43:15.421 --> 43:17.223
Uh, it's a quarter past eight.

43:17.323 --> 43:19.358
Yeah, I forgot to take
my cholesterol pills.

43:23.896 --> 43:25.798
Are you sure I can't get
you something to eat?

43:26.198 --> 43:29.101
No, thanks, Grandpa, I haven't had
much of an appetite today anyway.

43:29.568 --> 43:30.970
Plus, I got to get going.

43:33.339 --> 43:34.306
Bye, Grandpa.

43:39.979 --> 43:41.347
Hey, tell Grandma I said hi.

43:42.047 --> 43:42.948
Okay.

43:43.849 --> 43:44.516
Bye!

43:48.320 --> 43:50.956
Yeah, Grandma.

44:24.356 --> 44:27.126
You think anyone around here
would believe me

44:27.226 --> 44:30.562
if I said Jesus knocked me up?

44:31.263 --> 44:36.168
Yeah, that's what I'll go with,
immaculate conception.

44:36.568 --> 44:40.039
Yep, Jesus is the one,
Jesus is the daddy,

44:40.139 --> 44:43.275
he knocked me up,
I'm still a virgin.

You guys know any Tupac?

45:03.462 --> 45:06.432
Your brother was being a bad
boy, but if your mommy asks,

45:06.532 --> 45:09.301
he fell down when you were
playing tag, you understand?

45:10.569 --> 45:12.271
Now get up and go lay in bed.

45:15.140 --> 45:16.508

45:17.543 --> 45:18.410
please?

Okay, okay, okay, I deserved
that, I deserved that.

45:33.092 --> 45:35.060
Look, I'm so sorry, girl.

45:35.961 --> 45:39.031
Have you even got my texts, I've been
blowing up the phone like a hella cray.

45:39.598 --> 45:41.233
I don't know what
I was thinking.

45:41.333 --> 45:44.103
Maybe I thought, you know,
you're on a break, or something,

45:44.203 --> 45:46.138
like my dick is in her mouth,

45:46.238 --> 45:48.440
but my heart is
in your hands, you feel me?

45:48.540 --> 45:50.409
- Trey, I have something to tell you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

45:50.509 --> 45:52.044
Let me finish, let me finish.

45:52.679 --> 45:54.580
I know I made a mistake,

45:54.681 --> 45:58.016
but the truth is that hoe
ain't got nothing on you, girl.

45:59.686 --> 46:01.286
You're my one and only,

46:01.387 --> 46:03.288
the peanut butter
to my jelly sandwich, girl.

46:03.389 --> 46:05.157
- I love you.
- I'm pregnant.

46:05.257 --> 46:06.258
I love everything...

46:07.292 --> 46:09.328
Wait, what?

46:09.428 --> 46:10.630
You heard me.

46:10.730 --> 46:11.530
That shit ain't mine.

46:12.398 --> 46:13.899
I know that shit
for reals ain't mine.

46:13.999 --> 46:16.235
- Who's do you think it is?
- I don't know,

46:16.335 --> 46:18.103
maybe it's that one kid
you've been hanging with.

46:18.203 --> 46:19.571
What's his name, Noah Vanhomo?

46:19.672 --> 46:21.540
- No.
- I see the way he look at you.

46:22.274 --> 46:23.375
- He hit that, huh?
- No.

46:23.475 --> 46:25.010
- I know he hit that.
- Trey.

46:25.110 --> 46:26.545
You're the only person

46:26.646 --> 46:27.647
I've ever been with.

46:28.782 --> 46:31.216
You expect me to believe that?
How dumb you think I am?

46:31.316 --> 46:33.653

Well, Todd, state highway patrol

1:02:43.723 --> 1:02:45.457
what seems to be
a grizzly hit and run

1:02:45.557 --> 1:02:48.193
which occurred sometime

1:02:48.293 --> 1:02:49.561
When a man in a red pickup truck

1:02:49.662 --> 1:02:52.264
