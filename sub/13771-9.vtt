01:03.150 --> 01:04.586
Why?

01:04.673 --> 01:06.327
I spent the last five
nights in a chat room

01:06.414 --> 01:08.372
reeling in
this creep named Heinrich.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.548
I got his address
and showed up at his house

01:10.635 --> 01:12.681
with a printed transcript
of our conversations.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.422
He calls me "Sugarbuns"

01:14.509 --> 01:16.467
15 times
on nine separate occasions.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.165
-Reese...

01:18.252 --> 01:19.905
"What about my wife?
What about my kids?

I'll do anything."

01:23.344 --> 01:25.041
It's not
just for police anymore.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.521
Why do I care about this?

01:26.608 --> 01:28.262
The guy works at the racetrack.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.786
He's going to make bets
for us on the horses we pick.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.353
Well, the horses you pick.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.485
This is tomorrow's
racing form.

01:34.572 --> 01:35.921
You'll pick the winners

01:36.008 --> 01:37.401
and I'll place the bets--
we split the winnings

01:37.488 --> 01:40.100
50-50, like brothers.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.971
That's kind of nice.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.668
Yeah.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.105
I got to keep
this guy on his toes.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.323
Time to leave
a suspicious message

01:46.410 --> 01:47.890

01:49.631 --> 01:52.982
Wow, blackmailing a pervert
to facilitate underage gambling.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.071
How could this not work out?

01:55.158 --> 01:56.551
It didwork out.

01:56.638 --> 01:57.856
It's been four days and Reese

01:57.943 --> 02:00.032
and I have already won
almost $300.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.730
I can't believe it.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.819
Reese's plans usually end up
with a missing toe or something.

02:03.906 --> 02:07.344
Since when... do
you... buy lunch?

02:07.431 --> 02:10.869
Oh, well, I've been making
some extra money at work.

02:10.955 --> 02:13.263
There's an incentive
program at work

02:13.350 --> 02:15.439
where we're given bonuses
for finding

02:15.526 --> 02:17.441
inefficiencies
and it's really

02:17.528 --> 02:19.313
improved morale at the store.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.228
You know, I actually
enjoy going to work
now that everybody is...

02:21.315 --> 02:22.838
Whoa! Jeez,
are you okay?

02:22.925 --> 02:27.625
Trying to finish...
what God started?

02:27.712 --> 02:28.931
I'm sorry,
I didn't see the curb.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.150
I was distracted by that...

02:36.025 --> 02:37.853
Ow.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.248
Do you believe this?

02:41.335 --> 02:42.510
What happened?

02:42.597 --> 02:43.685
I was half way
through my haircut

02:43.772 --> 02:45.513
when Troy casually mentioned

02:45.600 --> 02:48.559
that his price had gone up
from $21 to $28.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.866
And he thought I would just
sit there and take it.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.302
Well, I showed him, Hal.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.956
I got up and
I walked right out of there.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.176
This is extortion,
pure and simple.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.395
What are you going
to do about...?

02:59.570 --> 03:01.616
-Here, even it up.
-What?

03:01.703 --> 03:03.400
I can't walk around like this.
Cut it.

03:03.487 --> 03:04.706
No, I couldn't.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.055
Hal, it doesn't
have to look good.

03:06.142 --> 03:07.448
Just hack this side
off. Even it up.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.760
Oh, my God.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.893
This is beautiful, Hal.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.895
You've never
done this before?

03:19.982 --> 03:22.637
No, I guess I just
have a knack for it.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.726
Lois, I didn't think
it was possible,

03:24.813 --> 03:28.033
but you are even more
stunning than ever.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.166
Oh, Hal.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.485
What in the...?

03:44.572 --> 03:46.400
This is my new car.
I bought it.

03:46.487 --> 03:47.966
Now, I know
what you're thinking,

03:48.053 --> 03:49.577
but please just give me
45 seconds to explain

03:49.664 --> 03:51.405
why this is the perfect
car for me

03:51.492 --> 03:53.407
and how it was such
and insanely great deal

03:53.494 --> 03:55.147
that I had no choice
but to buy it.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.149
Hey, there's some black gooey
stuff leaking out of it.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.499
I know it looks
fast and dangerous,

03:58.586 --> 03:59.804
but that's a good thing.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.676
Cops will have
their eye on my car,

04:01.763 --> 04:03.765
so I'll be extra motivated
to drive safe and slow.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.419
It didn't cost much,
so I'll have enough to pay

04:05.506 --> 04:06.768
for the first year's insurance.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.117
Think of all the money
you'll save

04:08.204 --> 04:09.640
from less wear and tear
on your car

04:09.727 --> 04:11.425
since I won't
have to drive it anymore.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.774
I can put my finger
through the metal.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.384
Dewey, get out of there!

04:14.471 --> 04:16.081
I'll be able
to work extra shifts

04:16.168 --> 04:17.822
since I won't
have to ride in with you,

04:17.909 --> 04:19.171
which means I'll be bringing
more money into the house.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.869
Oh, and I love it.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.915
I know you don't care,
but it just needed to be said.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.613
Malcolm, the fact that
you even want this so bad

04:25.700 --> 04:27.571
should have been your
first clue that this is...

04:27.658 --> 04:29.356
-Lois.
-Hal, he's not...

04:29.443 --> 04:32.097
Look, every boy
has to go through this.

04:32.184 --> 04:33.664
It's the only way
they find out

04:33.751 --> 04:35.100
what's important in a car.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.711
Look, let's go.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.930
I need to feather your
neckline a little bit.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.413
Where were you?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.154
We were supposed to meet
Heinrich right after lunch
to get our bets in.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.112
Today was totally wasted.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.723
Although he did
buy me a swimsuit.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.202
I got a car, Reese.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.726
I finally have a car.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.118
It's the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.424
It's a piece of crap.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.036
Don't listen to him.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.299
You're magnificent.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.522
WOMAN:
Lois, your hair looks beautiful.

05:05.609 --> 05:08.133
She's right, Lois.
It's fantastic.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.570
Thank you.

05:09.657 --> 05:10.745
I've been getting
compliments all day.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.486
It looks so much better.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.749
Yeah, I thought you were trapped
in the '70s with that old cut.

05:14.836 --> 05:15.750
And your head doesn't look

05:15.837 --> 05:17.534
so boxy anymore.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.145
Lois?

05:20.232 --> 05:23.105
What did you do to your hair?
I love it.

05:23.192 --> 05:24.759
Fred, isn't it fantastic?

05:24.846 --> 05:25.586
Mm-hmm.

05:25.673 --> 05:26.978
Who's your stylist?

05:27.065 --> 05:28.589
-My husband did it.
-Really?

05:28.676 --> 05:29.720
Where's his shop?

05:29.807 --> 05:31.287
He doesn't have one.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.723
I just got the scissors
out of the drawer and,

05:32.810 --> 05:34.508
I don't know,
he just got inspired.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.205
-Amazing.
-Okay, ladies, we're agreed.

05:36.292 --> 05:37.293
Lois looks beautiful.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.990
Now, let's get back to work.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.645
I got a job to do,
too, honey.

05:41.732 --> 05:44.082
Good evening, Fred.

05:44.169 --> 05:47.825
There goes
the soul of this store.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.087
And it keeps your nose

05:49.174 --> 05:50.175
from taking over your face.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.873
Yeah, thanks.

05:51.960 --> 05:52.743
So I'll see you tonight?

05:52.830 --> 05:54.571
I wouldn't miss it.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.794
Lois, you've got to help me.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.796
What?
I need you to cover
the rest of my shift for me.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.450
Again?
Craig, what's going on?

06:03.537 --> 06:05.843
Paula wants to surprise Fred
for their anniversary.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.976
He's a big golfer,
so she wants to learn how,

06:08.063 --> 06:09.543
so I've been giving her lessons.

06:09.630 --> 06:10.544
You don't know how to golf.

06:10.631 --> 06:11.632
True,

06:11.719 --> 06:13.285
but somehow she got the idea

06:13.373 --> 06:15.505
that I only missed the cut
at the Masters by three strokes.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.159
You lied to her?

06:17.246 --> 06:19.596
Lois, my job here
is hanging by a thread.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.337
I thought if I could
help the boss's wife

06:21.424 --> 06:23.557
surprise him with a game of
golf, they'd end up kissing

06:23.644 --> 06:26.211
on the 18th green, and maybe
I'd be in there somewhere

06:26.298 --> 06:27.822
getting the credit for it.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.606
Or you could just
work hard at your job

06:29.693 --> 06:31.042
and then you
wouldn't have to suck up.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.783
Lois, I don't have
time for your fantasies.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.045
I'm in trouble here.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.133
The first few lessons

06:35.220 --> 06:36.526
we worked on driving the cart,

06:36.613 --> 06:38.702
but now she wants to know
how to swing a club.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.182
I need to take a lesson

06:40.269 --> 06:41.879
so I can bluff my way
through her lesson.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.968
Craig...
Please, Lois.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.230
I can't lose this job.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.885
This is the only
true thing on my resume.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.583
All right,
but I'm only...

06:49.670 --> 06:51.411
FRED:
Feldspar.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.238
I want all those 50-pound bags
of dog food out on the floor

06:53.325 --> 06:54.588
before I get back
from the warehouse.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.241
I'm on it.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.329
Thanks, Lois.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.639
Sorry I'm late, Hal.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.598
The grocery store was...

07:04.685 --> 07:06.643
Hi, Lois.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.863
-Hal, what are you doing?
-Just giving Margie a new look.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.342
I had to have him do me.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.343
Your husband's a genius.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.910
And I get to keep the hair.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.695
Now where was I?
Oh, my sister.

07:14.782 --> 07:17.001
Honestly, a beach condo
on her salary.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.612
Who is she trying
to impress?

07:18.699 --> 07:20.875
She's just so insecure,
she always has been.

07:20.962 --> 07:21.919
Every year
she sends

07:22.006 --> 07:23.268
a Christmas card
with a picture

07:23.355 --> 07:24.705
of her family
sitting on a sailboat.

07:24.792 --> 07:25.662
It's not even theirs.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.272
Uh, Lois.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.579
Do you have to do the
grocery thing in here?

07:32.147 --> 07:33.627
So, they rent that boat
from their horrible neighbors

07:33.714 --> 07:35.411
who, P.S.,
don't even know how to sail.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.544
And the husband got that money
for it by very lucrative...

07:39.197 --> 07:42.244
[engine turning over]

07:43.593 --> 07:46.074
What is your problem,
you stupid car?

07:46.161 --> 07:47.379
You're driving me nuts.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.686
Where... were you?

07:49.773 --> 07:51.949
Oh, Stevie, good.
Here, take this.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.821
If it turns over, yank it out.

07:53.908 --> 07:57.085
I waited... at the library.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.347
You should have seen her today.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.001
I was at a light and these jerks

08:00.088 --> 08:01.785
pulled up next to me
wanting to race.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.613
I hit the gas
and she just flew.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.789
I totally blew the doors off
for four seconds

08:05.876 --> 08:07.487
before she dropped an oil pan.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.227
[engine starting]

08:09.314 --> 08:10.794
That's it!

08:10.881 --> 08:11.926
Malcolm, we did it.

08:12.013 --> 08:14.929
We won over $250 from...

08:15.016 --> 08:17.584
from the good grades program
at school.

08:17.671 --> 08:18.672
Awesome.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.412
That'll pay for this.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.503
Isn't it beautiful?

08:23.590 --> 08:25.679
This is for you.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.904
I e-mailed...
my chess move... days ago.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.298
Stevie, I don't have
to do everything with you.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.779
Tell you what.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.693
I'll take you for a drive.
That'll...

08:40.780 --> 08:42.477
[metallic crunching]

08:42.565 --> 08:45.307
[engine dies, metallic clank]

08:48.919 --> 08:51.835
What is your problem,
you stupid car?!

08:51.922 --> 08:53.533
You're driving me nuts!

08:55.056 --> 08:59.060
[mumbling to himself]

09:00.888 --> 09:03.325
So I'm thinking, I feel young,
so why not look young?

09:03.412 --> 09:04.848
So I got the Botox done

09:04.935 --> 09:06.807
to my crow's feet and my
forehead, then I had

09:06.894 --> 09:08.373
my chin done and
my tummy tucked.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.636
And I may not
stop there.

09:09.723 --> 09:10.637
Work it, girlfriend.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.856
Oh, hi, Lois.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.467
Can I talk to you for a minute?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.687
Does your grandmother know
you borrowed her hands?

09:17.774 --> 09:19.471
I went to six different stores

09:19.559 --> 09:21.996
and could not find that
avocado oil you recommended.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.912
Hal, this isn't working for me.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.304
Well, that's because you don't

09:26.391 --> 09:27.915
scrunch and sprits
like I told you to.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.394
No, this. Look.

09:29.481 --> 09:30.874
Craig is flaking out on me.

09:30.961 --> 09:32.963
I'm pulling
double shifts for him

09:33.050 --> 09:34.530
and every time I come home,
it's full of people.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.097
I never have any time alone.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.402
There is hair
everywhere.

09:37.489 --> 09:38.708
And I do not like the way

09:38.795 --> 09:40.449
you are standing lately.

09:40.536 --> 09:45.149
Lois, these women are walking
out of here with a glow.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.629
It's wonderful.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.196
Well, can't you
at least some of the money

09:48.283 --> 09:49.545
you're making
to hire a cleaning lady?

09:49.632 --> 09:52.504
I'm not accepting money
for this.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.854
What?!

09:53.941 --> 09:55.507
I am transforming
these women, Lois.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.813
I won't soil that with money.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.336
And it's not just the hair.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.947
They confide in me,

10:00.034 --> 10:01.688
they need someone
to listen to their problems.

10:01.775 --> 10:02.906
You wouldn't believe
what some of

10:02.993 --> 10:04.168
these women
are going through.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.692
Nancy, she's getting audited.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.345
Margie's husband
has a gambling problem,

10:07.432 --> 10:10.218
and Paula in there,
she is having an affair.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.523
What?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.308
Yes, for the last
five months.

10:13.395 --> 10:16.180
It's some guy she's pretending
to take golf lessons with.

10:22.578 --> 10:25.233
Why do you
keep doing this to me?

10:28.671 --> 10:31.761
I fix your throttle leakage
and your alternator dies.

10:31.848 --> 10:34.895
I buy you a new alternator
and your water pump explodes.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.548
Every time
I think I'm getting close,

10:36.636 --> 10:38.855
you find a new way to hurt me.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.031
Hey, thanks for
placing that bet today.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.467
I tried to get out
of detention,

10:42.554 --> 10:43.860
but none of the fire
alarms are working.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.035
Where's the money?

10:45.122 --> 10:47.342
-I never made the bet.
-What?

10:47.429 --> 10:49.779
I didn't make the bet. I spent
the money on something else.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.651
A car bra!

10:53.087 --> 10:55.132
What? You had $200.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.352
That horse came in
at five to two.

10:57.439 --> 10:58.658
I don't know
what that is,

10:58.745 --> 11:00.050
but I'm supposed
to get half of it.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.748
Sorry, man.
But look how hot she looks.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.880
Malcolm,
you got to calm down.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.534
This car is messing you up.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.231
This car is not messing me up.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.364
It's made me happier
than I've ever been in my life.

11:09.451 --> 11:13.629
[grunting]

11:14.717 --> 11:16.893
Oh, Lois, thank God.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.287
Fred asked me to scrub
out the Dumpsters tonight,

11:19.374 --> 11:20.984
but Paula wants to work
on her short iron,

11:21.071 --> 11:22.246
so I had to schedule
an emergency lesson

11:22.333 --> 11:23.770
with the golf pro.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.685
The guy charges,
like, 90 bucks an hour

11:25.772 --> 11:27.077
and it's really eating
away at my savings,

11:27.164 --> 11:28.557
but I guess I have no
one to blame but myself--

11:28.644 --> 11:30.037
and, oh, my God, you
know about the affair.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.125
Damn it!

11:31.212 --> 11:32.387
Damn it!

11:32.474 --> 11:33.388
You do know, right?

11:33.475 --> 11:34.215
Yes, I know.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.695
Damn it!

11:35.782 --> 11:37.522
Craig, how could
you lie to me

11:37.609 --> 11:38.959
after all I've
done for you?

11:39.046 --> 11:40.569
I let you sleep
on our floor

11:40.656 --> 11:42.614
when you though your cat's ghost
was trying to kill you.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.007
I settled that feud

11:44.094 --> 11:44.965
between you and the
Girl Scout troop.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.009
They started it.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.358
Shut up!

11:47.445 --> 11:49.360
I do all this
and you repay me

11:49.447 --> 11:51.493
by making me drag around
50-pound sacks of dog food

11:51.580 --> 11:53.234
so you can sleep
with the boss's wife?

11:53.321 --> 11:54.714
That's inexcusable!

11:54.801 --> 11:56.846
I didn't plan this.
It just happened.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.456
One night after inventory,

11:58.543 --> 12:00.067
we stopped in the
parking lot to talk.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.633
I bent down
to pick up her keys,

12:01.721 --> 12:02.939
the next thing I know,

12:03.026 --> 12:04.462
she's got me
handcuffed in a shower

12:04.549 --> 12:06.508
in a motel
out by the airport.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.510
She's crazy, Lois.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.120
But she makes me crazy, too.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.643
-Craig...
-I'm not kidding.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.645
There is a dark, scary place
inside of me

12:13.733 --> 12:15.299
that I didn't even know
was there,

12:15.386 --> 12:16.736
but Paula knew it was there,

12:16.823 --> 12:18.346
and every night
she takes me to that scary place

12:18.433 --> 12:20.000
and shows me some new,

12:20.087 --> 12:22.219
terrible, delicious
corner of it.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.221
You're not going
to rat on me, are you?

12:24.308 --> 12:27.007
No, but you have
to end this today.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.922
I can't, Lois.
I'm addicted.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.315
I don't even know
who I am anymore!

12:31.402 --> 12:33.665
I know I've let you down,

12:33.753 --> 12:35.189
but I want to thank you
for helping me anyway.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.581
Craig, I never said I...

12:36.668 --> 12:38.148
If that homeless guy
is still in the dumpster,

12:38.235 --> 12:39.410
just let him drink
from the hose.

12:39.497 --> 12:40.672
He'll leave you alone.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.155
Stupid car.

12:45.242 --> 12:46.417
That's four coats.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.071
Now will you run?!

12:48.158 --> 12:49.464
Malcolm, your leopard-skin
seat covers are here.

12:49.551 --> 12:50.508
Sweet.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.772
I can't wait to see you in them.

12:57.689 --> 12:58.995
What's going on?

12:59.082 --> 13:01.084
Malcolm, this is Mike.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.694
He's from AAA.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.131
You're in a safe place

13:04.218 --> 13:06.046
with people who care about you.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.221
Sit down, son.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.007
What's all this about?

13:11.094 --> 13:13.705
Stevie and Reese
have something to say

13:13.793 --> 13:16.056
and I think you
should listen.

13:16.143 --> 13:19.755
You've abandoned...
your friends.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.757
You didn't

13:21.844 --> 13:25.500
even notice my
new... deck shoes.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.154
Stevie, I've just
been busy, okay?

13:27.241 --> 13:29.243
Your car
is ruining everything.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.201
It's even affecting
our illegal gambling.

13:31.288 --> 13:32.637
I tried to pick
a winner myself,

13:32.724 --> 13:34.074
but since I'm an idiot,

13:34.161 --> 13:36.728
I picked one that came in
at over 600-to-one.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.384
I won $11,500
that I can't even touch

13:40.471 --> 13:42.256
because I'd have
to fill out a tax form!

13:42.343 --> 13:45.476
$11,500 that's just sitting
there tormenting me

13:45.563 --> 13:46.738
because of that stupid car!

13:46.826 --> 13:48.871
Stop calling it stupid!

13:48.958 --> 13:50.264
That car isn't stupid.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.874
That car is great.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.484
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.530
Really? Where'd you get
that shiner?

13:55.617 --> 13:58.098
That was my fault.
I wasn't being careful enough.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.708
Malcolm,

13:59.795 --> 14:01.579
we're here to help,

14:01.666 --> 14:03.668
but the first step
is for you to admit

14:03.755 --> 14:05.061
that you have a problem.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.411
I did.
That's why I'm in AAA.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.022
There's thousands of us,
Malcolm,

14:09.109 --> 14:11.154
and we all know
what you're going through.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.725
Wow.

14:16.812 --> 14:19.423
I guess I didn't realize
how bad things had gotten.

14:20.468 --> 14:21.773
I think I need to take

14:21.861 --> 14:23.950
a good long look at every...

14:28.650 --> 14:30.173
[engine starting]

14:30.260 --> 14:32.175
Oh, yeah.

14:32.262 --> 14:33.307
Oh, that's it.

14:38.573 --> 14:43.143
I didn't get...
to read... my poem.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.494
And then when
Martha left the room,

14:46.581 --> 14:49.323
Tina checked the price tag
on the leather coat--

14:49.410 --> 14:50.802
factory outlet.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.108
[chuckles]

14:52.195 --> 14:53.414
Temperature good for you?

14:53.501 --> 14:58.593
Perfect. As was
the scalp massage.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.465
So all you have to do
is cash in the ticket for me,

15:01.552 --> 15:04.729
give me the $11,000,
and you can keep $500.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.035
Deal.

15:06.122 --> 15:07.776
Thanks, man.

15:07.863 --> 15:10.039
Well, I think it's important
you have an adult you can trust.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.697
This car is a tease.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.091
Yesterday, she gave me
the ride of my life.

15:18.178 --> 15:21.050
Her bra flew off
before I even hit the freeway.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.922
I was so happy!

15:24.575 --> 15:26.229
And today, she won't even start.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.796
It's like yesterday
didn't even happen.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.277
I can't take this anymore!

15:30.364 --> 15:32.061
Please start!

15:32.148 --> 15:34.324
Please, I'm begging you!

15:34.411 --> 15:37.545
Just give me a little
something, please?!

15:37.632 --> 15:39.112
[engine starts]

15:39.199 --> 15:41.853
Oh, thank you so much!
I knew you'd come back.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.204
We're meant to be together.
Don't you see?

16:19.587 --> 16:20.980
Help!

16:21.067 --> 16:22.285
Somebody help me!

16:22.372 --> 16:23.895
I'm stuck!

16:23.983 --> 16:25.767
Help!

16:25.854 --> 16:27.116
There's a bit of a wait.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.726
We got slammed
with a wedding party

16:28.813 --> 16:30.163
and we're way behind.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.691
Ah, The Human Volcano.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.388
One of my favorites.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.390
Oh, it's so much better now
that he can read minds.

16:40.477 --> 16:41.739
Exactly.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.306
He used to just have
heat grip.

16:43.393 --> 16:44.699
How lame was that?

16:48.442 --> 16:50.096
You allergic to nuts?

16:50.183 --> 16:51.575
No.

16:51.662 --> 16:52.881
All right.

16:56.928 --> 16:59.105
What are you studying in school?

16:59.192 --> 17:01.237
Regular stuff, I guess.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.673
I don't really like school.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.240
Everybody makes fun of me.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.068
Yeah, I remember those days.

17:06.155 --> 17:07.809
Kids can be so cruel.

17:07.896 --> 17:10.290
The smart kids, the loners,

17:10.377 --> 17:11.813
they were the meanest.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.554
The worst is gym class.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.078
My own team throws the
ball at me in dodgeball.

17:17.426 --> 17:20.082
Hey, you know how
you can get out of gym?

17:20.169 --> 17:21.387
Pretend to have asthma.

17:21.474 --> 17:22.954
All you need
is a fake inhaler.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.347
Here, take mine.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.306
It also gets me
good seats on the bus.

17:26.393 --> 17:27.829
Don't worry.
Things are going

17:27.915 --> 17:29.918
to be better for you
from here on out.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.702
My dad tells me the same thing.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.574
Well, your dad's a smart man.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.793
Frank, your new haircut
looks great.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.100
Let me just get my purse
and I'll drive you back home
to your parents.

17:38.187 --> 17:41.190
Craig, you know Frank's parents,
Fred and Paula.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.975
Remember, Fred is our boss
at Lucky Aide?

17:44.063 --> 17:47.109
And I believe you're giving
golf lessons to his mom.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.458
Let's go, Frank.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.156
And I promise
I'll drive very safely

17:50.243 --> 17:51.896
so we don't have an accident.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.682
I wouldn't want to ruin your
life with my carelessness.

17:57.641 --> 18:00.427
[coughing]

18:00.514 --> 18:04.126
I'm not going to make it.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.606
Stevie was right about this car.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.695
[coughs]

18:07.782 --> 18:10.654
And so was Reese.

18:10.741 --> 18:14.441
He was right about the car
and the horse racing.

18:14.528 --> 18:17.879
[coughs]

18:17.966 --> 18:20.142
That makes it easier.

18:20.229 --> 18:25.060
I don't... want to live
in a world...

18:25.147 --> 18:26.757
where Reese is right.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.156
You really have to
snap those sheets

18:34.243 --> 18:35.766
if you want to get
the hair off.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.420
Come on. Throw your
fanny into it.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.074
Dad, seriously, you got to stop
talking like that.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.771
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.905
It's just so draining
listening to all these people

18:43.992 --> 18:45.341
with their tawdry
little secrets.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.038
Like that Paula woman,
Fred's wife?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.605
Not only is she cheating
on her husband,

18:48.692 --> 18:50.738
now she's two-timing
on her golf instructor

18:50.825 --> 18:52.131
with her swing-dance teacher.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.872
She is learning
new moves every night,

18:54.959 --> 18:56.222
if you know
what I'm talking about.

18:56.309 --> 18:57.875
She is so cold.

18:59.834 --> 19:00.878
Hey!

19:00.965 --> 19:02.576
Stevie, please, we're talking.

19:02.663 --> 19:05.274
And Sheila's husband Randy
just got a new assistant.

19:05.361 --> 19:06.667
She's 19 years old

19:06.754 --> 19:08.234
and she doesn't even
know how to type.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.236
The girl wears
a halter top to the office.

19:10.323 --> 19:11.846
Halter tops?

19:11.933 --> 19:13.369
Hello? Dukes of Hazzard
on line three.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.718
They want their costumes back.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.246
[coughing]

19:21.682 --> 19:23.510
Malcolm?
Malcolm, are you all right?

19:23.597 --> 19:24.946
What happened?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.252
It's okay. It's okay, son.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.078
You'll be fine.
Just breathe deep.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.255
[gasping]

19:29.342 --> 19:30.821
Stevie...

19:31.996 --> 19:34.564
...you saved my life.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.653
I treated you like dirt.
You saved my life.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.003
[coughing]

19:39.090 --> 19:41.876
Your wheel's kinda
on my crotch.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.574
Is it?

19:45.967 --> 19:47.142
I can get off early.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.404
Can't you cancel
your lesson?

19:48.491 --> 19:50.014
I wish I could,

19:50.101 --> 19:52.321
but we're working
on the Texas Two-Step tonight.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.280
We never see each other
anymore.

19:54.367 --> 19:57.370
Lois, I see you more
than I see my wife these days.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.894
Oh, Fred, things have a way
of changing for the better.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.417
You'll see.

20:01.504 --> 20:02.810
CRAIG [over P.A.]: Attention, Lucky Aide shoppers:

20:02.897 --> 20:04.812
My name is Craig Feldspar

20:04.899 --> 20:07.380
and I have a message
for Paula Lynch.

20:07.467 --> 20:10.165
[sobbing] Paula, I can't go on like this.

20:10.252 --> 20:14.343
I'm going to do the right thing
and make you my wife.

20:14.430 --> 20:18.652
I just bought an $11,500
engagement ring

20:18.739 --> 20:20.393
which I hope you'll accept.

20:22.090 --> 20:25.267
You're cheating on me
with Craig Feldspar?!

20:28.357 --> 20:31.099
I think we're both victims
here, Fred.

20:31.186 --> 20:33.797
I'm going to go...
something that way.

20:35.625 --> 20:36.974
Sure, it won't be easy for us,

20:37.061 --> 20:39.150
but the path of true love
never did run smooth.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.630
We'll move in
with my grandmother

20:40.717 --> 20:41.849
and care for her together.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.852
Well, they're about
to tow her away.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.288
You want to come
say good-bye?

20:46.375 --> 20:48.203
No.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.249
I know it's tough, son.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.207
I thought I'd never get over
my first car.

20:52.294 --> 20:57.038
'64 Plymouth Fury who couldn't
keep her top on.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.388
Then some guy
stole her from me.

20:59.475 --> 21:02.217
I saw her a few months later
with a new driver

21:02.304 --> 21:05.873
and a different paint job,
but she meant nothing to me.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.222
I had moved on.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.529
And so will you.

21:10.573 --> 21:11.966
Are you cutting my hair?

21:12.053 --> 21:13.315
No.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.224
