WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:05.437
- Here, let me help you.
- No, I got it.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.105
- No, I got it.
- No, really, I got it.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.573
I got it.

00:08.575 --> 00:10.709
I'm not sure about that bag on you.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.244
Well, perhaps with a different shoe?

00:12.246 --> 00:13.745
Nah.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.085
- You jealous?
- Jealous?

00:16.110 --> 00:18.377
Of how bad it looks on
you? I don't think so.

00:18.402 --> 00:21.657
Dr. Halstead, got a possible MI coming in.

00:21.867 --> 00:23.491
And good morning to you, Maggie.

00:23.516 --> 00:24.216
Good morning.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.868
Dr. Manning, it was a pleasure
being your caddy today.

00:26.893 --> 00:29.381
- Don't expect a tip.
- [chuckles]

00:29.406 --> 00:31.889
Hey, we still on for tonight?

00:31.914 --> 00:34.858
- Tonight?
- Ladies' night at Molly's,

00:34.860 --> 00:36.860
Me, you, and April.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.395
April hasn't had a date in a while.

00:38.420 --> 00:39.540
She can use some wingwomen.

00:39.565 --> 00:40.964
Me, a wing woman?

00:40.989 --> 00:43.723
Your hormones... they
will lure the dudes in.

00:43.748 --> 00:45.548
Right.

00:45.804 --> 00:47.271
Hey. Thank you.

00:47.273 --> 00:48.566
You're going the wrong way.

00:48.591 --> 00:51.325
Left my badge in the car.

00:51.350 --> 00:53.846
I'll think about it.

00:58.831 --> 01:02.792
Help! Help, anyone!

01:02.817 --> 01:04.266
I need help here.

01:05.167 --> 01:06.998
[grunts]

01:07.308 --> 01:09.996
I got her, I got her, I got her, I got her.

01:11.008 --> 01:13.775
Come on! She's bleeding from somewhere.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.368
Trauma two. Get your asses over here!

01:16.393 --> 01:17.792
Who is she? What happened?

01:17.803 --> 01:19.036
I don't know. I found her

01:19.038 --> 01:20.370
a couple blocks away
collapsed on the sidewalk.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.827
Let's get her on the monitors.

01:21.852 --> 01:22.788
April, you got this?

01:22.813 --> 01:25.086
Got it.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.554
- Where's she bleeding from?
- Working on it.

01:31.978 --> 01:34.345
HR 130.

01:34.370 --> 01:36.163
BP's at least 90. I've got a radial pulse.

01:36.188 --> 01:37.721
- All right, get two lines.
- On it.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.489
Get an I-STAT ABG and send labs.

01:39.491 --> 01:40.757
Make sure we type and cross.

01:40.759 --> 01:43.493
Can you hear me? Can you
tell me what happened?

01:43.495 --> 01:45.028
The blood... did you get shot?

01:45.030 --> 01:46.496
Let's get these wet clothes off her now.

01:46.498 --> 01:47.864
Don't worry. We're gonna put you in a gown

01:47.866 --> 01:49.085
and see what's going on, okay?

01:49.110 --> 01:51.011
Get blood, O negative, make sure it's warm.

01:51.036 --> 01:52.389
Put it on level one. Give her two.

01:52.414 --> 01:53.513
Hey, stay with me.

01:53.538 --> 01:54.444
You find the source?

01:54.469 --> 01:55.710
No head, neck, or torso trauma.

01:55.735 --> 01:58.136
Belly distended but soft.

02:01.524 --> 02:03.123
That's not an intestine.

02:03.148 --> 02:04.397
It's an umbilical cord.

02:04.422 --> 02:05.888
This kid just delivered a baby.

02:05.913 --> 02:08.781
- What do you mean "just"?
- Maybe five minutes ago.

02:08.806 --> 02:10.506
She's still bleeding. Clamp.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.596
Where did you deliver this baby?

02:13.621 --> 02:16.596
Hey, what happened to your baby?

02:24.655 --> 02:26.254
Hey, sir?

02:26.279 --> 02:28.410
Sir, you're the one who
brought the girl, yeah?

02:28.435 --> 02:29.929
- She gonna be okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

02:29.954 --> 02:32.301
Where'd you find her?
About two blocks that way.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.810
Okay, can you show me?

02:33.812 --> 02:34.878
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:34.903 --> 02:36.903
Hey, grab an OB kit and follow us.

02:36.928 --> 02:38.702
You got it.

02:46.564 --> 02:48.860
She was right there.

02:53.603 --> 02:56.431
What are we looking for?

03:06.745 --> 03:08.367
Sexton!

03:08.392 --> 03:09.623
Did she just abandon the thing?

03:09.648 --> 03:10.881
April!

03:12.572 --> 03:14.469
Bulb syringe.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.189
Come on.

03:19.214 --> 03:24.184
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

03:24.209 --> 03:26.273
- Come on...
- [baby gags, cries]

03:26.298 --> 03:28.527
Oh, okay. Blanket, blanket.

03:28.552 --> 03:30.605
- [baby crying]
- Oxygen.

03:35.951 --> 03:38.018
[murmuring] Okay... okay.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.390
There you go. All right.

03:39.415 --> 03:42.273
- I'll take him to the NICU.
- I'll take him.

03:51.282 --> 03:53.149
She hasn't delivered the placenta yet.

03:53.174 --> 03:55.220
It has to come out. Where the hell is OB?

03:55.245 --> 03:58.279
Stuck in a delivery. I can do it.

03:58.717 --> 04:00.946
I've done it before.

04:03.251 --> 04:04.976
I'm on the baby. You sure?

04:05.001 --> 04:06.200
Yes.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.301
April, where'd you find the baby?

04:09.326 --> 04:11.626
In a backpack behind
that building on Huron.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.951
We got there just in time.

04:21.387 --> 04:24.187
Hey, hotshot. Yeah, you.

04:24.212 --> 04:26.980
An old lady had a fall,
sprained her wrists.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.639
Last name Francis.

04:33.583 --> 04:37.485
Miss Francis? Ms. Connie Francis?

04:37.510 --> 04:39.565
That's me.

04:40.734 --> 04:43.168
You look awfully young to be a doctor.

04:43.193 --> 04:45.694
Oh, I'm a medical student. Sarah Reese.

04:45.696 --> 04:47.228
Why don't you come with us?

04:47.230 --> 04:48.530
Come with you?

04:48.532 --> 04:50.799
To the beach.

04:52.618 --> 04:55.586
Hey, did you bring the Coppertone?

04:55.611 --> 04:57.544
The...

05:00.496 --> 05:02.630
He says he's having a heart attack.

05:02.789 --> 05:04.588
He's always having a heart attack.

05:04.613 --> 05:07.081
I'm not always having a heart attack.

05:07.305 --> 05:10.015
Nope, just when the lawn needs mowing

05:10.040 --> 05:11.853
or the gutters need clearing

05:11.855 --> 05:14.540
or the garbage needs taking out.

05:14.931 --> 05:16.831
Can you describe the pain you're feeling?

05:16.864 --> 05:19.354
It feels like someone sitting on my chest,

05:19.379 --> 05:22.413
slowly squeezing the life out of me.

05:25.146 --> 05:27.357
How about we take a look?

05:28.608 --> 05:31.309
Keep your hands off of me.

05:31.311 --> 05:36.347
I want to go to the beach.
I want to go to the beach.

05:39.085 --> 05:42.153
Oh, Dr. Charles, good.
Could I get a consult?

05:42.155 --> 05:45.323
I need to get this splint on
her, but she won't sit still.

05:47.226 --> 05:49.493
I'm late, and we're still 30 minutes away

05:49.495 --> 05:50.795
from Fort Lauderdale.

05:50.797 --> 05:53.564
Ms. Francis, I am so sorry to hold you up,

05:53.566 --> 05:55.366
but do you mind if I ask
you a couple of questions?

05:55.368 --> 05:56.534
I'm Dr. Charles.

05:56.536 --> 05:57.935
Well, I hope you're not one of those

05:57.937 --> 05:59.403
stuck-up Princeton boys.

05:59.405 --> 06:01.205
Oh, heaven forbid.

06:01.207 --> 06:03.975
University of Pennsylvania,
thank you very much.

06:03.977 --> 06:06.978
Please forgive Ms. Reese.

06:06.980 --> 06:09.981
Smart and caring as she
is, she's still learning.

06:09.983 --> 06:12.883
Do you mind terribly if
we were to borrow this

06:12.885 --> 06:15.286
so that we could contact your loved ones?

06:15.288 --> 06:17.622
Well, if it won't take you too long.

06:17.624 --> 06:20.324
We will make it snappy.

06:20.326 --> 06:22.226
Be right back. Thank you.

06:25.004 --> 06:27.765
So it didn't occur to you
she might have dementia?

06:27.767 --> 06:30.668
That name didn't mean anything
to you, "Connie Francis"?

06:30.670 --> 06:32.637
Should it have?

06:32.639 --> 06:36.007
Oh, I'm so damn old. Just call her contact.

06:36.009 --> 06:38.109
Uh...

06:38.111 --> 06:40.423
If you could just fill
each of these with nuts,

06:40.448 --> 06:42.246
and I brought the nuts.

06:42.248 --> 06:44.749
I'll take care of everything else.

06:44.751 --> 06:46.117
Helen,

06:46.119 --> 06:48.705
I thought this was gonna
be a little bit more casual.

06:48.730 --> 06:50.565
But I just... I want it
to be just right, you know?

06:50.590 --> 06:52.056
I want... I want it to be something

06:52.058 --> 06:53.991
she'll remember always.

07:00.433 --> 07:03.000
Helen?

07:03.002 --> 07:05.536
Hey, what were you doing
with my mother-in-law?

07:05.538 --> 07:07.872
Who, Helen? Was she just here?

07:07.874 --> 07:10.007
Wish I would've known. I would've said hi.

07:10.009 --> 07:11.642
She handed you that pink box.

07:11.644 --> 07:12.643
Huh?

07:12.645 --> 07:14.927
What's in the box, Maggie?

07:14.952 --> 07:17.119
Maggie!

07:17.417 --> 07:19.784
Napkin diaper nut cups.

07:19.786 --> 07:22.127
What?

07:22.152 --> 07:25.319
Napkin diaper nut cups.

07:25.568 --> 07:27.001
You fold the colored napkin up, you see,

07:27.026 --> 07:29.160
and then you hold it
together with safety pins,

07:29.162 --> 07:31.556
- and then you stuff it...
- You're throwing me a shower?

07:31.581 --> 07:33.728
Surprise! Tonight at Molly's.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.666
So the whole ladies' night ruse...

07:35.691 --> 07:37.575
Just roll with it, okay?

07:37.698 --> 07:39.732
Fine.

07:39.757 --> 07:42.250
Oh, how's baby Doe? Poor thing.

07:42.275 --> 07:45.048
He's stable for now. And the mother?

07:45.073 --> 07:46.971
Just came to.

07:47.150 --> 07:49.416
Do we have any information on her yet?

07:49.441 --> 07:55.072
All we know is that her name... is Erika.

07:55.097 --> 07:58.672
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:02.238 --> 08:04.939
Hello, Erika. I'm Dr. Manning.

08:04.964 --> 08:07.186
When can I leave?

08:07.211 --> 08:09.199
Based on how much blood you lost

08:09.224 --> 08:10.965
and what your body's gone through,

08:10.990 --> 08:13.591
I'd say you're at least here overnight.

08:14.951 --> 08:18.722
Is there anyone I can
call, your mother or father?

08:18.747 --> 08:20.191
No.

08:20.216 --> 08:22.283
Maybe a friend?

08:25.899 --> 08:28.199
Did they find the backpack?

08:30.169 --> 08:31.961
Yes.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.628
How did you end up in that alley, Erika?

08:40.841 --> 08:43.408
Why did you leave your baby there?

08:43.433 --> 08:45.274
I don't know.

08:45.648 --> 08:47.949
I mean, I knew something
was going on inside me,

08:47.974 --> 08:51.747
but I figured if I could just
not think about it, then maybe...

08:52.937 --> 08:56.405
I'm so stupid. [sobs]

08:56.430 --> 09:00.011
I'm just so happy that somebody found him.

09:00.499 --> 09:05.329
Erika, honey, how old are you?

09:06.479 --> 09:08.656
14.

09:12.982 --> 09:16.017
There is someone you can call.

09:19.186 --> 09:22.620
She's 14 years old, a
kid. She's scared, alone.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.011
What about the family?

09:24.036 --> 09:25.970
Her mother's in prison. Father's long gone.

09:25.995 --> 09:27.995
She does have an older sister
living in Champaign, though.

09:28.014 --> 09:29.814
I left a message.

09:29.816 --> 09:32.349
Here's the thing...
she was two blocks away.

09:32.351 --> 09:34.385
Two blocks... maybe she
was trying the make it here.

09:34.387 --> 09:35.820
Is that what she said?

09:35.822 --> 09:38.255
She clamped the umbilical cord.

09:38.257 --> 09:40.157
She did not mean to harm that baby.

09:40.159 --> 09:42.430
Right. Put him in a backpack.
Leave him in an alley.

09:42.455 --> 09:43.494
That'll keep him safe.

09:43.496 --> 09:45.563
It's not that cut and
dried. She was delirious.

09:45.588 --> 09:47.832
She left her baby to die. It's
exactly that cut and dried.

09:47.834 --> 09:49.600
She's a child.

09:49.602 --> 09:52.087
She wasn't ready for any of this, right?

09:52.112 --> 09:53.447
People come here for help.

09:53.472 --> 09:55.039
I try to leave my feelings out of it.

09:55.064 --> 09:56.540
Well, that's convenient.

09:56.542 --> 10:00.023
Look, you don't understand
because you're not a woman.

10:00.048 --> 10:01.095
Don't give me that.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.767
People need to be held
accountable, regardless of sex.

10:03.792 --> 10:05.353
This is a safe haven.

10:05.378 --> 10:07.705
She could've dropped the
baby off, no questions asked.

10:07.730 --> 10:09.911
So now you do have feelings?

10:09.936 --> 10:13.211
She's got to live with this
for the rest of her life.

10:13.236 --> 10:15.103
Do we really want to punish her as well?

10:15.128 --> 10:16.900
You're talking as if there's a happy ending

10:16.925 --> 10:18.157
where that baby survives.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.884
That baby is going to survive.

10:19.909 --> 10:23.383
And if he doesn't, then
what that girl did is murder.

10:23.408 --> 10:26.383
How you gonna feel then?

10:39.561 --> 10:41.623
Who's the pediatric
surgery attending today?

10:41.648 --> 10:42.874
Dr. Grant.

10:42.899 --> 10:44.626
I've got to get back down to the ED.

10:44.651 --> 10:47.752
Page me if anything changes
with this one's condition, okay?

10:51.769 --> 10:53.702
- Dr. Rhodes.
- Yeah?

10:53.727 --> 10:55.916
Your father called. Wants
you to call him back.

10:55.941 --> 10:58.197
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.311
Excuse me, Dr. Czerny.

11:03.336 --> 11:05.336
You said yesterday that
you may have some time today

11:05.338 --> 11:07.205
to discuss our new tranexamic acid drug?

11:07.207 --> 11:08.573
Talk to me tomorrow.

11:08.575 --> 11:11.096
And are you even supposed to be in here?

11:11.288 --> 11:13.939
Have a great... day.

11:17.784 --> 11:18.962
Good morning.

11:18.987 --> 11:20.396
Good morning.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.505
Dr... Halstead.

11:24.530 --> 11:27.397
I'm Zoe Roth with Stewart
and Breck Pharmaceutical.

11:28.595 --> 11:30.628
Will.

11:32.553 --> 11:35.821
Okay, so how big of a problem is blood loss

11:35.846 --> 11:37.352
during surgery, Will?

11:37.377 --> 11:40.712
I'm an ER doc, Zoe.
Don't do a lot of surgery.

11:44.331 --> 11:47.532
But keep going. I might learn something.

11:47.557 --> 11:50.124
Well, you should know
that S&B is conducting

11:50.126 --> 11:52.159
a major multi-institutional trial

11:52.161 --> 11:53.961
to establish our product's efficacy

11:53.963 --> 11:57.654
in so many different uses and procedures.

11:57.870 --> 12:01.005
I'm sorry, I have a patient.
Can we do this tomorrow?

12:01.030 --> 12:03.353
W-what about later?

12:03.562 --> 12:06.053
Maybe over dinner?

12:06.265 --> 12:08.091
Dinner?

12:10.129 --> 12:12.090
Sure, I'm free for dinner.

12:12.115 --> 12:14.840
Good. Say about 8:00?

12:14.865 --> 12:17.632
Yeah, I'll meet you out front.

12:17.951 --> 12:21.441
Call me if there are any conflicts.

12:21.722 --> 12:23.789
All right, will do.

12:23.814 --> 12:26.540
Yeah, okay.

12:28.508 --> 12:30.308
She's very friendly.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.641
Just doing her job.

12:31.666 --> 12:33.991
You got a high fever in
treatment 5, dog bite in 4.

12:34.016 --> 12:35.482
These just came back from cardiology.

12:35.507 --> 12:37.441
Uh, thank you, April.

12:39.686 --> 12:42.553
Doug, Jenna, good news.

12:42.578 --> 12:44.679
Second set of enzymes came back fine.

12:44.704 --> 12:47.959
Both EKGs are normal,
CK and troponin as well.

12:48.172 --> 12:50.080
These chest X-rays look solid.

12:50.105 --> 12:51.671
So you're telling me I'm fine?

12:51.696 --> 12:52.962
That's what the tests say.

12:52.987 --> 12:54.787
Looks like you are good to go, my friend.

12:54.854 --> 12:56.387
I knew it, huh?

12:56.412 --> 12:58.479
We wasted six hours here,
and it's all on your head.

12:58.568 --> 13:00.801
Well, it's not that simple.

13:00.826 --> 13:02.540
There are plenty of other factors

13:02.565 --> 13:04.131
that can contribute to chest pain.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.801
It could be reflux or stress, anxiety...

13:06.803 --> 13:08.769
[laughs] Yeah, like I said,

13:08.771 --> 13:10.228
all in his head.

13:10.253 --> 13:11.931
Speaking of which, just
in time to pick up Liam

13:11.956 --> 13:13.989
from daycare. Bye.

13:16.579 --> 13:18.212
I'm gonna refer you to a cardiologist.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.367
She'll get you on a treadmill

13:19.392 --> 13:21.346
and put you through a stress test, okay?

13:21.371 --> 13:24.245
Like Jenna's not enough of a test.

13:24.442 --> 13:28.477
I started calling her
"Jenna-cide," as a dig,

13:28.612 --> 13:30.812
but it turns out she likes the nickname.

13:30.837 --> 13:32.437
All right.

13:32.462 --> 13:34.729
I'll see if they can get
you in this week, okay?

13:34.908 --> 13:36.695
In the meantime, you tell Jenna

13:36.720 --> 13:38.543
the doctor recommends no lawn mowing.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.000
[chuckles] Just in time

13:40.002 --> 13:41.291
to start shoveling snow.

13:41.428 --> 13:43.314
- All right, you take care.
- Thank you so much.

13:43.339 --> 13:44.592
Absolutely.

13:46.044 --> 13:47.852
Heard you had a bit of a morning.

13:47.877 --> 13:50.578
Yeah. So listen, my mother-in-law's

13:50.580 --> 13:52.313
throwing me a surprise baby shower tonight

13:52.315 --> 13:53.948
that I totally don't want to go to,

13:53.950 --> 13:55.783
so you have to come with me.

13:55.785 --> 13:59.291
Can't. I'm having dinner with Zoe.

13:59.486 --> 14:00.765
Zoe?

14:00.790 --> 14:04.225
The new S&B Pharma rep. Blonde hair.

14:04.227 --> 14:06.427
Yeah, I think I know the one.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.629
So you're deserting me in my hour of need

14:08.631 --> 14:09.930
to go get laid?

14:09.932 --> 14:12.299
What are you talking about?
It's strictly business.

14:12.301 --> 14:14.602
She wants to pitch me
on their new TXA product.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.003
Whatever.

14:16.005 --> 14:17.633
I was frantic trying to figure out

14:17.658 --> 14:19.173
where she'd gotten off to.

14:19.175 --> 14:22.653
Mr. Donovan, how long have we
been in the Connie Francis era?

14:22.678 --> 14:27.391
We met in Fort Lauderdale,
Spring Break, 1960...

14:27.416 --> 14:30.050
same year "Where the Boys Are" came out.

14:30.052 --> 14:33.954
Carol loved that movie.
She mixes it up in our life.

14:33.956 --> 14:37.168
This past year, it's been
getting worse and worse.

14:37.193 --> 14:40.063
Mr. Donovan, caring for
someone with dementia

14:40.088 --> 14:42.680
is one of the most
demanding tasks in the world.

14:42.705 --> 14:44.498
Remind yourself from time to time

14:44.500 --> 14:45.733
it's okay not to be perfect.

14:45.735 --> 14:47.334
Thank you, dear. I'll give that a try.

14:47.336 --> 14:48.396
Mr. Donovan,

14:48.421 --> 14:52.657
I just need your signature
for these discharge papers.

14:52.839 --> 14:54.172
What did I do?

14:54.197 --> 14:55.969
You get that from a greeting card

14:55.994 --> 14:57.794
or a fortune cookie?

14:59.164 --> 15:00.997
So where's my wife?

15:02.118 --> 15:04.297
[tapping on glass]

15:04.777 --> 15:07.378
Thank God.

15:08.004 --> 15:09.870
Carol?

15:09.895 --> 15:11.528
Who is this?

15:11.553 --> 15:13.186
Your husband.

15:13.211 --> 15:15.239
- My husband?
- Yes.

15:15.264 --> 15:19.967
He loves you, and he's gonna take you home.

15:19.969 --> 15:22.069
I'd rather go with you.

15:22.071 --> 15:23.504
I wouldn't know where to go.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.497
Tom does. Tom knows the way home.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.089
She'll need to keep the
splint on for about six weeks.

15:32.114 --> 15:33.380
I feel so stupid.

15:33.382 --> 15:36.396
Get up to go to the bathroom
and trip over the rug.

15:36.421 --> 15:39.122
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:39.527 --> 15:42.396
Are you hearing what I'm hearing?

15:43.072 --> 15:44.405
Are you okay to walk?

15:44.430 --> 15:47.463
Would you mind just getting up
and taking a few steps for me?

15:47.488 --> 15:49.761
- Sure.
- Here we go.

16:01.622 --> 16:02.955
What do you think?

16:02.980 --> 16:05.581
Magnetic gait and complete
recall of her injuries

16:05.606 --> 16:07.505
not consistent with a
diagnosis for Alzheimer's.

16:07.530 --> 16:09.186
- Very good.
- What's going on?

16:09.339 --> 16:12.124
I'd like to run a few tests on your wife.

16:12.149 --> 16:13.598
I promise it won't take long,

16:13.623 --> 16:15.507
and it could very well be worth our while.

16:15.532 --> 16:17.598
Sure.

16:19.374 --> 16:20.738
[alarm blaring]

16:20.763 --> 16:23.756
Juvie's hemorrhaging! Trauma 2!

16:28.515 --> 16:30.490
How many pads did she soak?

16:30.515 --> 16:32.156
- Dozen or more.
- She must still have

16:32.181 --> 16:34.455
retained products.
Which attending did this?

16:34.480 --> 16:36.256
They were busy. I did it.

16:36.281 --> 16:39.856
You? You did it?

16:40.679 --> 16:42.445
[sighs] All right, page OB.

16:42.470 --> 16:43.492
Let's get her up to the OR now.

16:43.517 --> 16:46.084
Got it. Yep, your newbie.

16:46.109 --> 16:50.326
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

16:51.670 --> 16:54.639
[beeps]

16:54.664 --> 16:55.997
How many units has she gotten?

16:55.999 --> 16:57.198
6.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.232
- Her most recent hemoglobin?
- 5.9.

16:59.257 --> 17:01.557
She still looks like a
ghost. She needs more blood.

17:01.559 --> 17:03.771
Restart the MTP.

17:03.796 --> 17:07.457
Give me methergine and
1,000 mics of Cytotec.

17:17.864 --> 17:20.002
Little room...

17:26.665 --> 17:29.262
Erika Dougherty's been
in the system for years.

17:29.287 --> 17:31.553
In and out of foster care
since her mom was sent to Logan.

17:31.555 --> 17:33.822
Runs away when the
families don't kick her out.

17:33.847 --> 17:37.449
Suspected substance abuse,
at least alcohol, maybe worse.

17:39.472 --> 17:41.107
Would you ask Dr. Manning

17:41.132 --> 17:43.299
- to step in here, please?
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

17:43.301 --> 17:44.867
What about the baby's father?

17:44.869 --> 17:46.669
[laughs] Who knows?

17:46.694 --> 17:49.261
Erika's been arrested more
than once for solicitation.

17:50.155 --> 17:51.918
- Ms. Goodwin?
- Yes, Dr. Manning,

17:51.943 --> 17:53.642
this Madeline Gastern

17:53.644 --> 17:56.779
from the Department of
Child and Family Services.

17:56.781 --> 17:58.314
What's the baby's condition?

17:58.316 --> 18:00.149
- He's stable.
- And Ms. Dougherty?

18:00.151 --> 18:01.383
Dr. Pachefsky's treating her.

18:01.385 --> 18:03.592
She may need a hysterectomy.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.434
I reached her older sister, Kara Dougherty.

18:08.459 --> 18:10.691
She's on her way up from Champaign.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.438
Kara's an adult.

18:12.463 --> 18:15.792
Could she potentially take
custody of Erika and the baby?

18:15.978 --> 18:17.838
Potentially.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.911
I know you always try
to keep families intact.

18:19.944 --> 18:21.834
Thank you, Dr. Manning.

18:24.104 --> 18:27.099
This girl is in big trouble.
She could be going to prison.

18:27.124 --> 18:30.389
Come on. She's 14 years old.

18:30.414 --> 18:32.514
Solicitation or not, that's rape.

18:32.516 --> 18:33.649
Doesn't absolve her.

18:33.651 --> 18:35.799
She's facing several potential felonies.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.091
Abandonment, attempted murder.

18:38.116 --> 18:41.264
It's up to the State's Attorney
and the judge, but Cook County?

18:41.289 --> 18:42.521
Anything could happen.

18:51.882 --> 18:53.553
I thought I got it all.

18:53.578 --> 18:55.547
Forcing the delivery of the placenta

18:55.572 --> 18:58.015
is an OB procedure, so what
the hell were you thinking?

18:58.040 --> 19:00.674
It was an emergency
situation. I made a decision.

19:00.699 --> 19:02.135
A bad one.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.593
You overstepped your
bounds, and you botched it.

19:04.618 --> 19:06.551
That girl almost needed a hysterectomy.

19:06.576 --> 19:08.736
A 14-year-old!

19:08.761 --> 19:12.229
Now, let me ask you something, Dr. Choi.

19:12.867 --> 19:15.234
You didn't like this patient.
You disapproved of her.

19:15.259 --> 19:18.326
You think that affected my
judgment and my performance?

19:18.351 --> 19:21.265
You tell me.

19:21.999 --> 19:25.053
<i>Dr. Halstead to the E.D.
Dr. Halstead to the E.D.</i>

19:25.078 --> 19:26.812
<i>Code Blue.</i>

19:26.837 --> 19:29.538
Dr. Halstead, cardiac arrest, treatment 5.

19:29.563 --> 19:31.730
- Your patient.
- <i>Code Blue.</i>

19:32.757 --> 19:35.425
I thought you said he was gonna be okay.

19:35.450 --> 19:37.178
Get the pads on him.

19:38.082 --> 19:39.582
He was in earlier. Is there anything

19:39.607 --> 19:41.073
we need to know from his charts?

19:41.098 --> 19:44.126
No. We did a full workup,
and everything checked out.

19:44.151 --> 19:46.532
I was driving home, and he... I looked over

19:46.557 --> 19:48.857
and he was just white as a sheet.

19:48.859 --> 19:51.960
And then I turned around and
drove back as fast as I could.

19:51.962 --> 19:53.426
I don't think he was breathing.

19:53.451 --> 19:55.311
Ma'am, I'm sorry. You need to wait outside.

19:55.336 --> 19:57.369
Okay.

20:02.082 --> 20:04.549
Hold compressions.

20:04.574 --> 20:06.901
V-fib, charge to 200 joules.

20:06.926 --> 20:08.659
- Everyone clear.
- All: Clear.

20:08.684 --> 20:11.072
[electric pulse]

20:11.984 --> 20:13.116
I got a pulse.

20:13.141 --> 20:15.594
He's in sinus rhythm, brady at 50.

20:15.619 --> 20:16.351
BP?

20:16.376 --> 20:17.442
90 over 45.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.368
[beeps] Wait, wait, wait. 72 over 35.

20:20.393 --> 20:23.202
Start dopamine at 10 and
titrate to a systolic of 90.

20:23.227 --> 20:24.827
- Yes, sir.
- Get a 12 lead EKG.

20:24.829 --> 20:26.228
Right away, Dr. Halstead.

20:26.253 --> 20:29.187
We gotta get his BP up.

20:35.773 --> 20:37.052
You paged me?

20:37.077 --> 20:38.543
Dr. Grant.

20:39.833 --> 20:42.900
Pneumothorax. Right lung collapsed.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.643
Tubing him now.

20:56.872 --> 20:59.472
O2 sats at 78. We get below 75 and...

20:59.497 --> 21:01.063
We're not getting below 75.

21:01.065 --> 21:02.197
Campbell.

21:02.222 --> 21:04.088
What do you need?

21:04.113 --> 21:07.249
Inhaled nitric oxide. We
need to improve oxygenation.

21:07.274 --> 21:09.967
I'll get a tank.

21:11.174 --> 21:13.241
He's really bradycardic.

21:13.266 --> 21:14.961
Turn up the dopamine. It
should help the pressure

21:14.986 --> 21:16.308
and heart rate.

21:16.333 --> 21:19.172
Dr. Halstead, it's been 15
minutes... make a decision.

21:19.197 --> 21:21.465
I'm not giving up yet.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.765
RV's not moving.

21:24.790 --> 21:27.591
You have a blown-out
RV and severe akinesis.

21:27.616 --> 21:29.749
I think you might want to
consider giving more fluids

21:29.774 --> 21:31.664
instead of escalating the pressers.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.288
Call RT for a tank of nitric oxide.

21:40.313 --> 21:41.672
Nitric oxide?

21:41.758 --> 21:44.025
It'll reduce the afterload
so that the heart works less

21:44.050 --> 21:45.916
and buy some time till
the cath lab is ready.

21:45.941 --> 21:47.207
I've never seen it used for this.

21:47.232 --> 21:49.158
It's unorthodox, I know,

21:49.183 --> 21:52.800
but I don't have a balloon
pump, and we're out of options.

21:53.770 --> 21:56.250
RT says Dr. Manning is
signing out the last tank.

21:56.275 --> 21:58.509
They'll have another ready in ten minutes.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.807
He'll be dead by then.

22:06.943 --> 22:08.042
Nat, where are you going?

22:08.067 --> 22:10.367
NICU. Baby Doe's sats are in the 70s.

22:10.392 --> 22:12.259
- Put him on ECMO.
- That's a last resort.

22:12.284 --> 22:14.003
I'm sorry, but I need this tank.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.027
What the hell are you doing?

22:15.052 --> 22:16.214
I have no other option. You do.

22:16.239 --> 22:17.504
- Give me that tank!
- Nat,

22:17.529 --> 22:19.011
my patient will die without it.

22:19.036 --> 22:20.369
You're putting the baby at risk.

22:20.394 --> 22:21.626
I'm not gonna lose this guy.

22:21.651 --> 22:23.304
- Will...
- He's got three kids.

22:23.329 --> 22:27.204
Try thinking like a doctor
and not a pregnant woman.

22:31.781 --> 22:33.757
He's in v-fib. Lost his pulse again.

22:33.782 --> 22:35.148
Charge to 200. Everyone clear.

22:35.173 --> 22:36.453
- [beeps]
- All: Clear.

22:36.478 --> 22:38.511
[electric pulse]

22:39.661 --> 22:41.717
One more round of epi. Let's go.

22:41.742 --> 22:44.147
Restart compressions.

22:46.908 --> 22:47.907
Nothing.

22:47.932 --> 22:49.332
Come on!

22:49.357 --> 22:51.452
Doug? Doug, please?

22:51.477 --> 22:54.077
Please listen to me, okay?
We need you, all right?

22:54.079 --> 22:55.646
- I need you, okay?
- Nurse.

22:55.671 --> 22:58.672
- Please?
- [sobbing] Please... stop.

22:59.804 --> 23:01.638
Hold compressions.

23:01.663 --> 23:04.932
I got a pulse. Sinus brady again.

23:04.957 --> 23:07.040
Start amnio drip. Let's
get him to the cath lab.

23:07.065 --> 23:09.439
Let's unclamp.

23:10.468 --> 23:12.435
Turn on the circuit.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.241
ECMO acts as a heart-lung bypass,

23:14.266 --> 23:17.262
oxygenating the infant's
blood outside its body.

23:20.103 --> 23:23.117
- Sats are rising.
- Thank God.

23:23.142 --> 23:24.441
Dr. Manning?

23:24.443 --> 23:26.941
There's a Kara Dougherty
downstairs to see you.

23:26.966 --> 23:28.499
Okay.

23:30.479 --> 23:32.848
The usual, Dino.

23:44.625 --> 23:46.444
Dr. Charles.

23:46.469 --> 23:48.636
Dr. Choi.

23:56.986 --> 24:00.521
You were in the... what, the Navy, right?

24:00.546 --> 24:03.554
Still am. Naval Reserves.

24:03.579 --> 24:07.581
Doc I did my residency with
was on away leave from the Navy.

24:07.606 --> 24:09.038
[chuckles]

24:09.063 --> 24:11.482
It was tough as hell practicing
psychiatry with you guys.

24:11.507 --> 24:14.014
Couldn't get anybody to open up.

24:14.039 --> 24:17.074
Could be a sign of weakness.

24:24.785 --> 24:27.230
Pork rind?

24:27.849 --> 24:29.373
No, thanks.

24:29.398 --> 24:31.130
No?

24:32.992 --> 24:35.630
I shouldn't eat this stuff so much.

24:36.245 --> 24:39.230
Guess that military culture's tough, right?

24:39.255 --> 24:42.274
Loose lips and all?

24:43.037 --> 24:46.473
[loud crunching]

24:53.612 --> 24:55.111
[clears throat]

24:55.324 --> 24:56.857
Last chance, man.

24:56.882 --> 24:58.933
Pretty sure they're organic.

24:58.958 --> 25:01.633
- I'm good.
- No?

25:11.455 --> 25:14.462
Kara, I'm Natalie. We spoke on the phone.

25:14.486 --> 25:15.878
I brought Erika some clothes.

25:15.903 --> 25:17.275
Thank you.

25:17.300 --> 25:20.175
- Where's my sister?
- Follow me.

25:21.728 --> 25:23.862
There were some
complications with the birth,

25:23.887 --> 25:25.595
but we think the baby's gonna be fine.

25:25.597 --> 25:26.763
You think?

25:26.765 --> 25:28.065
It's still very early,

25:28.067 --> 25:30.634
but we have the best
neonatal ICU in the Midwest.

25:30.636 --> 25:32.002
I could take you up to see him if you want.

25:32.004 --> 25:33.079
Maybe later.

25:33.104 --> 25:34.848
I spoke to a social worker.

25:34.873 --> 25:37.065
It might be possible for Erika and the baby

25:37.090 --> 25:39.484
to come live with you.

25:39.509 --> 25:41.883
Let me talk to her.

25:48.468 --> 25:50.928
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.655
You really stabilized him using nitric?

26:10.680 --> 26:12.910
Interesting.

26:13.001 --> 26:14.836
What about the patient?

26:14.861 --> 26:17.091
The RCA was completely occluded,

26:17.116 --> 26:19.416
and there was a 60%
occlusion of the circumflex.

26:19.418 --> 26:21.785
I stented both and placed
an impella for a couple days

26:21.787 --> 26:23.110
to rest the heart.

26:23.135 --> 26:25.735
What was his code time?

26:25.872 --> 26:27.935
Maybe 20 minutes total.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.626
20 minutes?

26:30.317 --> 26:32.616
I would've let him go.

26:35.696 --> 26:39.265
What's the difference
between God and a doctor?

26:40.060 --> 26:43.547
God knows he's not a doctor.

26:55.244 --> 26:56.676
I just got a page.

26:56.701 --> 26:58.334
Dr. Rhodes?

26:58.384 --> 26:59.517
Yeah?

26:59.542 --> 27:02.118
Please, my boss wants to talk to you.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.869
Okay.

27:19.622 --> 27:21.788
You wear the scrubs well.

27:21.813 --> 27:24.609
I'm glad you approve.

27:25.539 --> 27:28.139
Long time.

27:30.966 --> 27:32.266
Got a couple of minutes?

27:32.291 --> 27:34.510
We can go grab a coffee, maybe catch up.

27:34.535 --> 27:36.935
I'm working.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.927
Ah.

27:39.192 --> 27:42.260
You know, I took it as a good
sign that you'd come home,

27:42.285 --> 27:44.084
that maybe you'd worked
through your issues?

27:44.102 --> 27:45.702
My issues?

27:45.704 --> 27:47.109
Come on.

27:47.391 --> 27:49.850
Let it go. Let's move on.

27:49.875 --> 27:51.609
You're still the same, aren't you?

27:51.910 --> 27:53.887
Just untouchable.

27:53.912 --> 27:55.178
Let me tell you something.

27:55.180 --> 27:58.114
When you left this town,
Connor, I was deeply hurt.

27:58.325 --> 28:01.118
Yeah. You ask Claire.

28:01.514 --> 28:05.409
But right now, I'm willing
to put all that behind me,

28:05.781 --> 28:09.016
for the two of us to start over.

28:13.835 --> 28:16.269
It's a good pitch, Dad.

28:16.294 --> 28:20.147
Really. You hit all the right notes.

28:22.124 --> 28:24.425
I'm not buying it.

28:30.772 --> 28:33.563
We can go.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.767
You ready to see your nephew?

28:40.792 --> 28:42.446
I wish I could help them.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.007
Kara.

28:44.032 --> 28:45.772
I just got a promotion...

28:45.797 --> 28:48.665
customer service rep...
and my boyfriend and I

28:48.667 --> 28:50.835
are talking about us moving in together.

28:50.860 --> 28:53.880
I've come too far to get sucked
back into this crap again.

28:53.905 --> 28:56.172
They're your family.

28:56.197 --> 28:59.232
You make that sound like a good thing.

29:09.278 --> 29:11.989
Hold that position.

29:15.048 --> 29:17.915
What did you say this
might be again, hydro what?

29:17.940 --> 29:19.340
Hydrocephalus.

29:19.365 --> 29:21.280
Literally means "water on the brain."

29:21.343 --> 29:23.835
The lumbar puncture should
relieve some pressure.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.626
So her dementia might...

29:25.651 --> 29:28.459
Well, hopefully, we'll see
some cognitive improvement,

29:28.484 --> 29:30.891
and if that's the case,
we'll implant a surgical shunt

29:30.916 --> 29:32.959
for long-term treatment.

29:32.984 --> 29:36.686
I, uh... [chuckles] the summer we met,

29:36.824 --> 29:39.304
- dancing to "Where the Boys Are."
- Wow.

29:39.329 --> 29:41.863
I'd give anything to
see that look in her eyes

29:41.888 --> 29:43.521
even one more time.

29:44.841 --> 29:46.373
How did they miss this?

29:46.398 --> 29:48.128
How did I miss it?

29:48.262 --> 29:51.430
How would you know? I
mean, give yourself a break.

29:51.455 --> 29:53.715
It goes undiagnosed 80% of the time.

29:53.740 --> 29:56.641
I feel like I betrayed her.

29:57.826 --> 30:02.395
Sometimes, when somebody
that we love gets sick,

30:02.421 --> 30:05.392
very easy to lose sight of the person

30:05.417 --> 30:07.150
and see only the disease.

30:07.268 --> 30:11.944
Remembering that our loved one
is still there... not always easy.

30:13.351 --> 30:16.486
Why don't you go get yourself
a cup of coffee, okay?

30:16.511 --> 30:18.210
This can take a while. I'm here.

30:18.235 --> 30:19.835
I know where to find you.

30:29.866 --> 30:31.837
Nat.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.090
Dr. Manning,

30:37.193 --> 30:39.927
the police are on their way
to talk to Erika Dougherty.

30:39.952 --> 30:41.738
- Police?
- That's the way it works.

30:41.763 --> 30:42.941
What are they gonna do to her?

30:42.966 --> 30:44.610
I don't know. It's not my call.

30:44.635 --> 30:45.840
Can't you change this?

30:45.865 --> 30:48.499
No, and neither can you.

30:50.899 --> 30:53.233
Well, this should make you happy.

31:03.412 --> 31:07.709
<i>[TV voices]</i>

31:07.734 --> 31:08.915
<i>[TV stops]</i>

31:08.940 --> 31:11.196
Listen...

31:11.221 --> 31:14.623
the hospital's only two blocks away.

31:14.648 --> 31:16.781
What?

31:16.806 --> 31:18.423
The police will be here soon.

31:18.448 --> 31:22.410
Tell them you knew the hospital
was only two blocks away.

31:22.435 --> 31:24.268
The cops are coming?

31:24.293 --> 31:27.227
And tell them you clamped
the umbilical cord.

31:29.156 --> 31:31.446
You wanted your baby to live.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.405
The neurologist will talk more about this,

31:48.430 --> 31:50.396
but there are going to be deficits...

31:50.422 --> 31:51.925
increased irritability,

31:51.950 --> 31:55.218
forgetfulness, impaired mobility.

31:55.243 --> 31:57.643
He won't be getting
out of bed anytime soon.

31:57.940 --> 32:00.741
I'm sorry. I don't understand, um...

32:00.766 --> 32:01.700
deficits?

32:01.725 --> 32:03.501
We'll see how he does in rehab.

32:03.526 --> 32:06.961
I'm sorry, but your husband's
going to need a lot of care.

32:11.108 --> 32:13.470
Oh, my God.

32:17.367 --> 32:19.667
What have you done?

32:21.226 --> 32:24.528
Have you turned my
husband into a vegetable?

32:27.108 --> 32:30.109
We don't know the extent of the damage.

32:31.844 --> 32:33.581
This is not what Doug would've wanted.

32:33.606 --> 32:35.540
He would never want this.

32:35.565 --> 32:38.549
Why didn't you tell me
something like this would happen?

32:38.574 --> 32:42.349
We... We have three kids.

32:42.374 --> 32:45.850
We live... we live paycheck to paycheck.

32:46.249 --> 32:49.749
What am I supposed to do now?

32:52.080 --> 32:54.986
You son of a bitch!

32:56.409 --> 32:58.749
[sobbing]

33:05.790 --> 33:08.002
[continues sobbing]

33:12.551 --> 33:14.618
She's still weak from the delivery.

33:14.643 --> 33:16.684
We just need to ask her a couple questions.

33:16.709 --> 33:19.395
She's not facing any charges yet.

33:19.718 --> 33:23.294
Would you mind just giving
me a moment with her?

33:25.189 --> 33:27.141
Yeah, sure.

33:32.107 --> 33:34.234
She's gone.

33:34.313 --> 33:37.859
Shocker. Leave a 14-year-old
runaway unattended...

33:41.485 --> 33:43.019
[deep sigh]

33:43.044 --> 33:45.032
That poor baby.

33:45.805 --> 33:49.006
I had this fantasy I
could give him a family.

33:49.188 --> 33:51.355
Where was my head at?

33:51.632 --> 33:54.099
You weren't thinking with your head.

33:55.498 --> 33:57.265
And good for you.

33:59.044 --> 34:02.174
You want out of the shower,
everyone'll understand.

34:02.789 --> 34:05.174
Ugh, maybe not Helen.

34:05.199 --> 34:06.674
Oh, Helen.

34:06.699 --> 34:09.074
[both chuckling]

34:10.871 --> 34:12.670
Yeah.

34:14.257 --> 34:16.219
Yeah.

34:17.268 --> 34:20.330
Time to rally. All right.

34:28.811 --> 34:32.699
Dr. Charles... do you know?

34:32.732 --> 34:35.099
Did they find that girl?

34:35.123 --> 34:36.900
Oh, not yet.

34:40.016 --> 34:42.455
I think it's my fault she took off.

34:42.561 --> 34:44.962
I told her the police were coming.

34:44.987 --> 34:47.050
Huh.

34:47.583 --> 34:49.384
So, um...

34:49.409 --> 34:52.094
how's that sitting with you?

34:53.489 --> 34:55.255
Thought I'd feel worse.

34:55.281 --> 34:58.877
Huh. Interesting.

35:08.660 --> 35:11.215
What are you doing?

35:11.508 --> 35:14.515
Trying to figure out where I went wrong.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.173
Guy showed up this morning.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.205
I ran these, discharged him.

35:19.230 --> 35:22.505
Two hours later, he's
wheeled in with a massive MI.

35:22.530 --> 35:24.830
How did I miss it?

35:29.359 --> 35:31.492
Where was the lesion?

35:31.517 --> 35:33.390
Right coronary.

35:35.612 --> 35:37.336
I know what I'm looking for,

35:37.361 --> 35:39.620
and I don't see any abnormalities.

35:39.645 --> 35:42.251
I got the guy back, but it's not good.

35:42.949 --> 35:46.050
It's not good.

35:49.077 --> 35:51.270
Sorry, man.

35:51.590 --> 35:54.270
- It's late.
- [pats]

35:54.295 --> 35:55.695
Yeah.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.768
Hello there.

36:02.970 --> 36:05.303
Do you know where you are?

36:05.328 --> 36:06.850
In a hospital.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.949
And can you tell me your name, please?

36:08.974 --> 36:12.249
Carol. Carol Donovan.

36:12.274 --> 36:14.050
Good.

36:14.724 --> 36:18.796
- Why am I here?
- You had some buildup

36:18.821 --> 36:21.288
in the frontal subcortical
region of your brain.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.949
We drained about 50 ccs of spinal fluid.

36:23.974 --> 36:27.183
What my colleague is trying to say

36:27.208 --> 36:28.750
is that you weren't quite yourself.

36:28.774 --> 36:31.320
The pressure on your brain was causing you

36:31.345 --> 36:33.851
to see things in a different way,

36:33.876 --> 36:35.924
and now that pressure has been relieved.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.066
Can I ask you, do you feel
strong enough to stand,

36:39.091 --> 36:41.980
- take a few steps?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

36:50.279 --> 36:52.993
Tom, honey.

37:00.323 --> 37:04.035
Carol. You're back.

37:04.060 --> 37:06.060
I was here...

37:06.277 --> 37:10.126
and I was not here at the same time.

37:10.151 --> 37:12.960
Like I was fading away.

37:13.034 --> 37:14.533
It all seemed so real.

37:14.558 --> 37:16.725
Your memories are gonna feel very real.

37:16.750 --> 37:18.817
That's perfectly normal and to be expected,

37:18.842 --> 37:21.471
but this was just a temporary fix.

37:21.496 --> 37:24.160
We're gonna have to do another procedure.

37:26.648 --> 37:31.484
Ms. Donovan, I have something
for you and Mr. Donovan.

37:31.509 --> 37:36.159
I went online and did a little research.

38:07.284 --> 38:09.051
Dr. Halstead, how are you?

38:09.076 --> 38:10.789
I am so sorry.

38:10.814 --> 38:12.447
I got bogged down with a case,

38:12.472 --> 38:14.539
and I totally lost track of time.

38:14.564 --> 38:18.289
My bad, completely. Can
I... can I get a rain check?

38:21.540 --> 38:23.039
No problem.

38:23.064 --> 38:25.231
I just got pulled into a sales
meeting that's going long,

38:25.256 --> 38:26.995
so this works out for me as well.
