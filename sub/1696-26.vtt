WEBVTT

00:07.776 --> 00:10.506
As if I didn't feel bad enough already.

00:13.182 --> 00:16.379
Stewart!
I'm sick of your leaves in my pool!

00:16.451 --> 00:19.079
Well, I'm sick of your face in my house.

00:20.689 --> 00:23.385
Whoa, Jethro, since
you're not whittling right now,

00:23.458 --> 00:26.655
why don't you use your hands
to cover your mouth?

00:26.728 --> 00:29.754
Uncle Albert, I want to swim!
What's taking so long?

00:29.832 --> 00:33.427
I thought you said the hillbilly
was scared of you!

00:33.502 --> 00:36.801
He is. Look, I've got him trembling.

00:36.872 --> 00:39.898
Come on,
I'm only here for the weekend

00:39.975 --> 00:43.172
and you said we'd do stuff.

00:43.245 --> 00:45.805
- Stop nagging.
- I wanna do stuff!

00:45.881 --> 00:48.714
- Stop nagging!
- I wanna do stuff!

00:48.784 --> 00:51.446
Stop nagging!

00:54.456 --> 00:56.981
I don't know where she gets it from.

00:57.860 --> 01:00.260
Keep your leaves out of my pool!

01:03.098 --> 01:04.827
Finally, some peace and quiet.

01:04.900 --> 01:08.267
Dad!
- It was nice while it lasted.

01:08.337 --> 01:10.532
Dad, why aren't you dressed?

01:10.606 --> 01:13.700
The Stella Fabiani Fashion Show
is tomorrow

01:13.775 --> 01:15.640
and you promised
you'd take me and Lilly to the mall

01:15.711 --> 01:17.770
to get shoes, makeup and manicures.

01:17.846 --> 01:19.837
- You did. I remember. I was there.
- Yeah.

01:19.915 --> 01:22.315
Come on, come on, let's boogie!

01:23.685 --> 01:26.279
Oh, not that kind of boogie.

01:26.855 --> 01:29.517
I'm sorry, honey, but I don't think
I'm gonna be able to take you.

01:29.591 --> 01:30.990
This thing's knocked me flatter than

01:31.059 --> 01:34.893
Uncle Earl's inflatable butt cushion
after football season!

01:35.964 --> 01:39.161
Now there's a mental picture
I really didn't need.

01:39.835 --> 01:42.065
It's okay, Dad. Feel better, get well.

01:42.137 --> 01:45.265
- I'll just make Jackson take me.
No!

01:45.340 --> 01:50.004
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:50.078 --> 01:52.046
No way! It's not gonna happen!

01:52.114 --> 01:54.344
Cooper and I are going
to a Dodger game today.

01:54.416 --> 01:56.714
And I'm breaking in a new foam finger.

01:58.420 --> 02:01.856
Jackson, Lilly and I have stuff
we have to do,

02:01.924 --> 02:04.392
and you go to a baseball game
practically every weekend.

02:04.459 --> 02:06.086
This is so unfair.

02:06.161 --> 02:09.096
Every time you can't haul her
all over town,

02:09.163 --> 02:11.189
I'm the one who gets stuck doing it.

02:11.266 --> 02:14.429
I miss baseball games,
basketball games, parties.

02:14.503 --> 02:18.872
I mean, I have a life of my own
and I am sick of you ruining it!

02:19.441 --> 02:22.569
And I'm sick as a dog.
So stop complaining.

02:22.644 --> 02:24.236
Take your sister
where she needs to go.

02:24.313 --> 02:28.181
- I'll get you tickets to another game.
- Fine. Man.

02:28.984 --> 02:32.215
Now what am I supposed to do
with my new foam finger?

02:32.287 --> 02:36.087
Oh, I know, you can use it
to wipe away your whiny little tears.

02:36.158 --> 02:37.989
Get over it!

02:43.632 --> 02:44.997
<i> Come on!</i>

02:45.067 --> 02:49.128
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:49.204 --> 02:52.537

02:52.607 --> 02:56.668

02:56.745 --> 03:01.546

<i>Who would have thought</i>

<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:10.325 --> 03:14.318

03:14.396 --> 03:16.193
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:16.264 --> 03:17.959
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:18.033 --> 03:22.493
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:38.253 --> 03:40.244
Oh, why do I always look?

03:42.224 --> 03:44.556
Hey, Daddy, how're you feeling?

03:45.160 --> 03:46.684
Sorry, darling, but I just don't think

03:46.762 --> 03:49.196
I'm gonna be able to take you
to that fashion show this evening.

03:49.264 --> 03:51.562
Oh, that's fine, Daddy.
I'll just make Jackson...

03:51.633 --> 03:53.430
No!

03:53.502 --> 03:58.405
No, no, no, no, no, no!

03:58.473 --> 04:02.432
You already ruined my Saturday.
You can't have my Sunday, too.

04:02.511 --> 04:04.809
Jackson, stop complaining.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.575
If it wasn't for me,
you would've been stuck

04:06.648 --> 04:08.775
at that stupid baseball game
all day yesterday.

04:08.850 --> 04:12.342
And I heard on the news that
one team didn't even have any hits.

04:12.421 --> 04:15.015
They call it a no-hitter!

04:16.190 --> 04:18.785
Exactly. Boring!

04:21.730 --> 04:24.062
Dad, you sound great!

04:24.966 --> 04:27.434
You are really getting it out!

04:27.502 --> 04:29.663
Speaking of getting it out,

04:29.738 --> 04:31.763
maybe a little fresh air
would do you good.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.671
Maybe drive Miley to the fashion show?

04:33.742 --> 04:34.868
No.

04:34.943 --> 04:37.468
Oh, come on, you're just gonna let
a little cold beat you?

04:37.546 --> 04:41.004
You're just gonna abandon your son
in his time of need?

04:41.083 --> 04:42.311
Yeah.

04:43.652 --> 04:46.382
California's made you soft, old man!

04:47.989 --> 04:49.820
I can't believe how selfish you're being.

04:49.891 --> 04:53.258
Dad's sick, and I need a little help,
and all you've done is complain.

04:53.328 --> 04:56.525
Oh, please, if you were me,
you'd do exactly the same thing.

04:56.598 --> 04:58.361
No, see, Jackson,
that's where you're wrong.

04:58.433 --> 05:00.901
If I was lucky enough
to have a little sister,

05:00.969 --> 05:03.028
I'd change my plans
when she needed my help

05:03.105 --> 05:05.232
and I would do it
without whining like a little baby.

05:06.575 --> 05:10.306
Okay, see, that's easy to say when
you don't actually have a little sister.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.777
Not my fault. I always wanted one.

05:11.847 --> 05:15.248
Yeah, I always wanted a puppy
but they brought you home instead.

05:15.317 --> 05:16.579
Too bad.

05:23.158 --> 05:25.592
Your father gave me
his backwoods cold.

05:25.660 --> 05:27.787
Yesterday, I was the picture of health.

05:27.863 --> 05:31.026
Now look at me,
I'm withering away to nothing.

05:32.300 --> 05:35.792
Well, on the bright side, maybe
you'll see your toes by Christmas.

05:35.871 --> 05:38.772
Listen, Junior, I'm stuck with
my niece for the weekend,

05:38.840 --> 05:40.398
but now I'm too sick
to schlep her around.

05:40.475 --> 05:44.309
So congratulations,
you've won an 8-year-old for the day.

05:44.379 --> 05:46.108
I don't think so.

05:46.181 --> 05:48.979
Are you gonna grow any more
or is that it?

05:50.552 --> 05:52.543
Okay, bye-bye.

05:52.621 --> 05:55.385
Stewart, please, please.
I'm begging here.

05:55.457 --> 05:58.221
What do you want me to do,
get down on my knees?

05:58.293 --> 06:01.285
Look, there's no way that I could put up
with this brat for a whole day.

06:01.363 --> 06:04.594
I mean,
I've already got one upstairs who

06:04.666 --> 06:07.157
always wanted a little sister.

06:07.235 --> 06:09.169
And you are perfect.

06:10.005 --> 06:12.496
Hey, Miles! I got a little present for you!

06:12.574 --> 06:14.769
I don't know what you're up to,
and I don't care.

06:14.843 --> 06:16.242
Have her home by dinner.

06:16.311 --> 06:20.509
If I don't answer the door,
stick her through the mail slot!

06:20.582 --> 06:22.277
All right, here's five bucks.

06:22.350 --> 06:24.250
Just keep your mouth shut
for two minutes.

06:24.319 --> 06:27.379
Make it 10, you've got a deal,
leprechaun.

06:28.590 --> 06:31.388
What present?
What are you talking about?

06:32.060 --> 06:33.925
Who's this? Hi, sweetie.
What's your name?

06:33.995 --> 06:38.694
This is Patty. She's Dontzig's niece
and your new little sister for the day.

06:38.767 --> 06:41.861
- What?
- He's sick, she needs a babysitter.

06:41.937 --> 06:45.202
You always said you wanted
a little sister. Well, ta-da!

06:46.274 --> 06:50.301
You've got two wishes left.
If you need me, I'll be in the lamp.

06:52.747 --> 06:55.682
- What's wrong with her?
- She's shy.

06:57.719 --> 06:59.744
Oh, that's so cute.

06:59.821 --> 07:02.289
Sorry, sweetheart, I can't,
I've already made plans.

07:02.357 --> 07:04.655
Which somebody already knew about.

07:04.726 --> 07:06.785
Oh, you've got plans.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.955
Kind of like the ones
I had to give up yesterday for you.

07:10.031 --> 07:11.999
That's... That's totally different.

07:12.067 --> 07:14.558
The fashion show
is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

07:14.636 --> 07:17.571
So was the no-hitter! All right?

07:17.639 --> 07:21.598
The truth is, you are just too selfish
to give up one day of your life

07:21.676 --> 07:26.079
for a sweet, innocent, little girl,
the way I always do for you.

07:26.147 --> 07:29.207
- That's so not true.
- Oh, please.

07:29.284 --> 07:33.015
- You wouldn't last one day with this kid.
- Oh, yeah?

07:33.088 --> 07:35.488
Doing whatever she wants
without a single complaint.

07:35.557 --> 07:38.424
- You wanna bet?
- Yes, I do. Right now.

07:39.694 --> 07:42.128
But, you know I've got to go
to that fashion show...

07:42.197 --> 07:46.133
Coward. Gutless. Chicken.

07:47.936 --> 07:49.267
Cowardly gutless chicken.

07:52.307 --> 07:56.175
Okay, okay, okay, fine!
I'll give up my fashion show.

07:56.244 --> 07:59.304
But when I win, which I will,

07:59.381 --> 08:01.542
you have to drive me around
wherever I want to go,

08:01.616 --> 08:04.847
whenever I want to go,
without a single complaint,

08:04.919 --> 08:07.353
for the rest of my non-driving life!

08:07.422 --> 08:09.151
And when you don't,

08:09.224 --> 08:13.752
which you won't, all right,
then I am free, forever.

08:14.529 --> 08:16.997
Whatever she wants. No complaints.

08:18.133 --> 08:19.566
- Deal.
- Deal.

08:20.969 --> 08:23.096
Three, two, one.

08:23.171 --> 08:26.140
- Make me a sandwich or I'll scream.
- What?

08:30.211 --> 08:32.337
You set me up.

08:32.414 --> 08:36.316
Do I hear a complaint?
Do we already have a winner?

08:36.985 --> 08:39.351
No, no, no. Forget it. I'm not caving.

08:39.421 --> 08:41.116
I'm gonna get through this afternoon.

08:41.188 --> 08:45.455
And for dinner, I'm gonna watch
you eat a big slice of humble pie.

08:45.527 --> 08:49.361
You know what I wanna watch?
You making me my sandwich!

08:49.431 --> 08:51.558
Now close your mouth
and open the fridge.

08:51.633 --> 08:53.624
I'm not getting any younger!

08:53.702 --> 08:57.433
Okay, listen here, kid,
I've only got one thing to tell you.

08:58.907 --> 09:00.499
White or wheat?

09:05.146 --> 09:07.080
Hey, Roxy,
you don't need to come over.

09:07.148 --> 09:09.241
I'm feeling much, much better.

09:09.317 --> 09:11.717
- Is that so?
- Yes, ma'am.

09:11.786 --> 09:14.619
As a matter of fact
I was just heading out for a jog.

09:14.689 --> 09:17.157
Then why're you lying on the couch
in that ratty old robe?

09:17.225 --> 09:19.921
- How did you...
- You can't lie to Roxy.

09:20.729 --> 09:22.253
Roxy knows everything.

09:22.330 --> 09:25.595
I'm omniscient,
omnipresent and omnipotent.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.692
Look them up, country boy.

09:28.269 --> 09:30.066
Hey, I appreciate
what you're trying to do

09:30.138 --> 09:31.628
but your job's not to take care of me,

09:31.706 --> 09:33.640
it's to be a bodyguard
for Hannah Montana.

09:33.708 --> 09:36.905
That's just the fever talking.
You know, we're just like family.

09:36.978 --> 09:40.846
Now, just let your Aunt Roxy
take care of those nasty, nasty germs.

09:40.915 --> 09:42.542
- But what if you get sick?
- Ha!

09:42.617 --> 09:46.280
Roxy ain't afraid of no germs,
germs are afraid of Roxy.

09:46.354 --> 09:48.879
Now, the first thing we're gonna do
is get you in the shower.

09:48.957 --> 09:51.653
Steam those suckers out
and open up those pores.

09:51.726 --> 09:53.956
Plus, you are a little ripe.

09:54.829 --> 09:57.195
That would be the smell of fear.

09:57.265 --> 09:59.790
Besides, I can't even
make it up those stairs.

09:59.868 --> 10:02.928
That's where 60 hours
of fire-fighting training comes in handy.

10:03.004 --> 10:05.529
Now just relax and enjoy the ride.

10:06.408 --> 10:08.399
Put me down! Stop it!

10:08.476 --> 10:11.001
Why did I give you a house key?

10:16.184 --> 10:19.381
How's it going so far, Miles?
Any complaints?

10:19.454 --> 10:22.617
No, after she ran over me
with her boogie board

10:22.690 --> 10:24.885
and threw up on me in the kayak,

10:24.959 --> 10:27.894
you know, this is actually
kind of relaxing.

10:29.597 --> 10:33.089
Except for the sand crabs,
but I'm not complaining.

10:33.168 --> 10:35.966
Glad to hear it.
Hey, Patty, wanna get some ice cream?

10:36.037 --> 10:37.299
Yeah!

10:37.839 --> 10:39.932
- Patty, can I get up now?
- No way.

10:40.008 --> 10:41.999
When I get back,
I wanna take a picture.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.941
And don't move.

10:44.012 --> 10:46.071
You heard her. Don't move!

10:46.815 --> 10:49.875
And just remember,
I'm still gonna win the bet.

10:50.418 --> 10:54.582
As long as you don't move.
Try not to think about the sand crabs.

10:54.656 --> 10:56.055
Right.

10:56.124 --> 10:57.591
Not thinking.

10:58.927 --> 11:00.588
I'm not thinking.

11:01.596 --> 11:03.393
That was a big one!

11:41.436 --> 11:44.428
Roxy, how long
do I have to stay in this thing?

11:44.506 --> 11:46.167
Oh, honey, you're just medium rare.

11:46.241 --> 11:49.574
We're looking to get you
all the way to well done.

11:49.644 --> 11:51.908
Look at that,
I've been so busy taking care of you,

11:51.980 --> 11:54.244
I almost forgot about lunch.

11:56.284 --> 11:57.808
What're you doing?

11:57.886 --> 12:00.081
I hate it when my burger
sticks to my pan,

12:00.154 --> 12:02.452
or in this case, my man!

12:07.128 --> 12:09.688
I don't understand why you don't
just dump the kid and go home.

12:09.764 --> 12:13.222
And I don't understand
why you eat with your face.

12:13.301 --> 12:16.759
I'm not dumping the kid because
I'm winning the bet! Look at her.

12:16.838 --> 12:20.103
I'm tired.
I wanna go back to Uncle Albert's.

12:20.174 --> 12:23.439
Watch this, I'm gonna win this bet
and get to go to my fashion show.

12:23.511 --> 12:25.342
Any minute now
she's gonna come over here and say...

12:25.413 --> 12:27.108
- I wanna go home.
- Yes!

12:27.181 --> 12:29.046
- No!
- Game over!

12:29.117 --> 12:32.518
I was this close to cracking. But I didn't.

12:32.587 --> 12:34.555
<i>She's done, I won</i>

12:34.622 --> 12:36.681
<i>I didn't cave, now you're my slave</i>

12:36.758 --> 12:39.022
<i>I get to go to the fashion show</i>

12:41.696 --> 12:44.688
Slow down, Busta Rhymes.
You can't go home yet.

12:44.766 --> 12:47.326
There's gotta be something else
you wanna do.

12:47.402 --> 12:48.562
What about a moose?

12:48.636 --> 12:51.366
From the world-famous
Make A Moose Store.

12:51.439 --> 12:53.430
They've got a Make A Moose here?

12:53.508 --> 12:56.671
Are you kidding?
It's one of the biggest in the country.

12:56.744 --> 12:59.008
My brother goes there all the time,
and he loves it!

12:59.080 --> 13:02.481
Oliver! She doesn't want to go there.

13:03.751 --> 13:06.185
Honey, you don't wanna go
to Make A Moose.

13:06.254 --> 13:08.415
It's just a bunch of hot,
sweaty, screaming kids,

13:08.489 --> 13:09.922
fighting over moose parts.

13:09.991 --> 13:13.518
Doesn't that sound like fun?
And don't forget that cute song.

13:13.595 --> 13:16.758
<i>Make, make, make a moose</i>
<i>here at Make A Moose</i>

13:16.831 --> 13:18.458
<i>Make a moose, make a moose</i>
<i>make a moose, make a moose</i>

13:18.533 --> 13:20.194
<i>here at Make A Moose</i>

13:20.268 --> 13:23.362
- Oliver!
- I'm sorry. It's catchy.

13:24.372 --> 13:26.465
Now, honey,
didn't you say you were tired?

13:26.541 --> 13:29.999
Wouldn't you much rather go home
and relax and just watch some TV?

13:30.078 --> 13:32.012
- Well...
- Or you could go home later

13:32.080 --> 13:35.072
and watch TV and cuddle up
with your new best friend,

13:35.149 --> 13:37.913
Moosey McMooserpants.

13:37.986 --> 13:39.317
That's what you really wanna do.

13:39.387 --> 13:42.788
No, what you really want to do
is go home and relax. Aah!

13:42.857 --> 13:46.884
- Make a Moose. Ooh!
- Go home and relax. Aah!

13:46.961 --> 13:48.588
Make a Moose. Ooh!

13:49.330 --> 13:52.595
I think I wanna go make a moose!

14:03.578 --> 14:06.308
This is so cool!

14:08.616 --> 14:11.210
And it's even noisier than I thought!

14:11.853 --> 14:13.912
What's the matter,
you got a headache?

14:13.988 --> 14:18.152
No, I'm just seeing where my antlers
would attach if I had them.

14:22.864 --> 14:25.765
All first time moose makers
to the clearing.

14:26.668 --> 14:28.067
Come on.

14:32.073 --> 14:35.702
Lilly, I don't want to hear
how incredible the fashion show is.

14:35.777 --> 14:36.937
Okay, then I won't tell you

14:37.011 --> 14:39.605
how celebrity model Lindsay Lohan
twisted her ankle.

14:39.681 --> 14:41.376
Isn't that great?

14:41.716 --> 14:43.013
Why is that great?

14:43.084 --> 14:45.348
Because they told me
if Hannah Montana

14:45.420 --> 14:48.116
could get here before the finale,
she could fill in

14:48.189 --> 14:51.955
and keep the one-of-a-kind
Stella Fabiani dress.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.155
Lilly, I don't wanna hear about this.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.322
I'm sending you a picture now.

14:57.398 --> 14:58.763
And I don't want to see it, either.

15:00.535 --> 15:03.368
Oh, it is beautiful!

15:03.438 --> 15:05.633
Why are you doing this to me?

15:06.908 --> 15:08.398
Pretty.

15:08.476 --> 15:12.469
You know, if I was you,
I would do anything to own that dress.

15:12.547 --> 15:16.142
That precious, precious dress.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.475
Hear that?

15:19.554 --> 15:22.717
<i>Give, give, give up the bet</i>
<i>give it up right now</i>

15:22.790 --> 15:26.851
No. No, no, no, I'm gonna win this bet
and get the dress.

15:26.928 --> 15:29.624
Lilly, tell Stella I'll be there faster
than she can say "make a moose. "

15:29.697 --> 15:33.360
Why would Stella Fabiani
say "make a moose"?

15:33.434 --> 15:36.096
Just tell her I'll be there!

15:36.170 --> 15:40.129
- Okay, Patty, let's goose this moose!
- Welcome to Make A Moose!

15:40.208 --> 15:42.438
- I'm Moose Master Mike.
- Who cares?

15:42.510 --> 15:44.034
Like my grandma
says on Thanksgiving,

15:44.112 --> 15:45.409
"Let's get to the stuffing!"

15:45.480 --> 15:48.176
- Wait, I have a question.
- No, you don't.

15:48.249 --> 15:51.343
You said there were over
100 different mooses.

15:51.419 --> 15:54.911
- Could you name them all?
- Of course.

15:55.723 --> 16:00.057
You better learn to sleep
with your eyes open. Yeah.

16:01.462 --> 16:04.158
Number one. Moose Lee.

16:09.070 --> 16:12.870
Number 23. Moose Skywalker.

16:13.808 --> 16:17.403
May the forest be with you.

16:17.478 --> 16:19.639
'Cause it's a moose.

16:23.351 --> 16:24.409
Perfect.

16:24.485 --> 16:26.851
Roxy's hot pot of burning funk.

16:28.456 --> 16:29.923
Oh, yeah. That's it.

16:29.991 --> 16:31.652
You don't want your funk
too hot or too cold,

16:31.726 --> 16:33.694
you want your funk just right.

16:33.761 --> 16:35.319
Now get ready.

16:35.396 --> 16:38.957
It looks delicious, Roxy,
but I'm just not hungry.

16:39.033 --> 16:42.161
Oh, honey, you don't eat the funk,
the funk eats you.

16:42.236 --> 16:44.101
Whoa, what are you doing?

16:45.540 --> 16:46.905
What...

16:47.608 --> 16:51.044
Hey. My sinuses, they're opening up.

16:51.112 --> 16:52.443
Mmm-hmm.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.745
I can finally breathe.

16:55.716 --> 16:58.583
- What's that horrible smell?
- Oh, that's the funk!

17:02.190 --> 17:06.559
Number 49. I love Moosey.

17:06.627 --> 17:09.686
Hey, Moosey, I'm home!

17:14.367 --> 17:18.134
Fifty more.
Or you could quit now and get to Stella.

17:18.205 --> 17:21.368
Forget it. I'm not quitting!
Come on, Patty, let's make a moose!

17:21.442 --> 17:23.137
Please stay with the herd.

17:23.211 --> 17:26.044
Tell it to someone who cares,
Bullwinkle!

17:41.295 --> 17:44.321
Here you go. Hannah Moosetana!

17:44.832 --> 17:46.766
- How lame.
- She's perfect.

17:46.834 --> 17:47.823
Ha!

17:48.135 --> 17:50.865
- Except she needs more stuffing.
- Ha!

17:50.938 --> 17:53.031
I'd like to stuff something all right.

17:53.107 --> 17:56.543
- Complaining?
- No. Of course not.

18:05.486 --> 18:08.455
Oh, come on. Faster! Faster!

18:08.522 --> 18:11.286
Put it off! My moose is getting too big!

18:11.359 --> 18:13.486
Oh, man. It won't shut off.

18:16.731 --> 18:21.532
Abusing the stuffer will result
in confiscation of your moose.

18:21.602 --> 18:24.503
There was no moose abuse.
We were just looking.

18:24.572 --> 18:27.336
- Go about your business, please.
- Wait, I have a question.

18:27.408 --> 18:30.536
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

18:30.611 --> 18:34.547
I was just wondering,
what is the difference

18:34.615 --> 18:37.675
between a moose and a caribou?

18:38.552 --> 18:40.747
That's my favorite question.

18:41.555 --> 18:46.015
First of all, a moose is larger.
Much, much larger.

18:46.093 --> 18:48.561
Well, then maybe my moose
should be bigger!

18:48.629 --> 18:51.189
- Your moose is fine.
- But he said...

18:51.265 --> 18:53.392
I don't care what he said!
I've done enough for you!

18:53.467 --> 18:57.062
I'm sick of this! I have my own life!
And I'm not gonna let you ruin it!

18:57.138 --> 19:01.040
- That's it! I win! You blew up!
- I did not blow up!

19:04.845 --> 19:06.403
Now I blew up.

19:09.016 --> 19:11.814
You know,
when I pictured winning the bet,

19:11.886 --> 19:14.446
I never quite pictured it like this.

19:16.257 --> 19:17.884
Oh, really? That's funny.

19:17.959 --> 19:19.950
I always pictured myself
with my pants blown off,

19:20.027 --> 19:22.587
forced to wear an itchy moose suit.

19:22.964 --> 19:24.932
Remember, it's a loaner.

19:26.767 --> 19:29.861
Is lugging me around really as awful
as what you put me through today?

19:29.937 --> 19:31.097
Yeah.

19:32.139 --> 19:34.733
No, but sometimes it feels that way.

19:35.643 --> 19:37.577
But you know the part
that bothers me the most?

19:37.645 --> 19:40.375
- What?
- You never even ask.

19:40.448 --> 19:42.473
You just kind of expect it.

19:42.550 --> 19:45.018
And you never say thanks.

19:45.086 --> 19:46.986
You're right. I don't.

19:47.888 --> 19:51.654
But since I won the bet, I guess we
don't have to worry about it anymore.

19:51.726 --> 19:53.853
Yeah, I guess not.

19:53.928 --> 19:55.919
And, Jackson, I'm really sorry

19:55.997 --> 19:58.966
for all the things you had to miss
'cause of me.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.227
Thanks.

20:00.935 --> 20:03.165
Now, we better get a move on
if we're gonna drop Patty off,

20:03.237 --> 20:05.501
get to that fashion show
and get you that dress.

20:05.573 --> 20:08.269
- What?
- Well, it's different when I offer.

20:08.342 --> 20:12.039
Then I'm doing it because I want to,
not because I have to.

20:12.613 --> 20:16.879
- Miles, you don't have to do that.
- I know. I'm doing it 'cause I want to.

20:16.951 --> 20:19.818
- And thanks.
- You're welcome.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.946
- Come on, Patty, let's go.
- This was the best day ever!

20:22.023 --> 20:24.685
I'm so glad Uncle Albert
pretended to be sick!

20:24.759 --> 20:25.783
- What?
- What?

20:25.860 --> 20:27.225
Oops!

20:37.671 --> 20:40.902
I can't believe you guys made it.
She's gonna look so good in that dress.

20:40.975 --> 20:44.206
- And then she gets to keep it.
- If she can get in it.

20:45.413 --> 20:47.404
Why would she not be able to get in it?

20:47.481 --> 20:48.778
When I left her backstage,

20:48.849 --> 20:52.341
she was having a little trouble
with the stuck zipper.

20:52.420 --> 20:56.379
- There's no zipper on that dress.
- I'm not talking about the dress.

20:56.457 --> 20:59.324
<i>And now adding</i>
<i>her own unique style</i>

20:59.393 --> 21:01.224
<i>to a Stella Fabiani original,</i>

21:01.295 --> 21:04.423
<i>celebrity model Hannah Montana!</i>

21:07.668 --> 21:10.068
What the heck is that?

21:10.137 --> 21:13.664
It's what all the mooses
are wearing in Paris this year.

21:26.687 --> 21:29.781
Thanks, Roxy.
I haven't felt this good in years.

21:29.857 --> 21:34.055
Anytime, sugar, seeing that bounce
in your step is all the reward I need.

21:34.128 --> 21:36.392
Well, I'm just gonna go out
for a run now

21:36.464 --> 21:39.661
so, please, don't feel like
you have to wait here for me.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.496
Please, don't.

21:43.237 --> 21:45.000
Just let me collect
my lotions and potions.

21:45.072 --> 21:46.130
And sorry about that pot.

21:46.207 --> 21:49.574
I guess even cast iron
can't stand up to Roxy's funk.

21:52.746 --> 21:55.977
- You sure you're okay, Dad?
- I feel horrible, Son.

21:56.050 --> 21:57.449
But if I don't get that woman
out of here,

21:57.518 --> 21:59.452
she's gonna nurse me to death.

21:59.520 --> 22:03.251
What part of "Roxy hears everything"
don't you understand?

22:03.324 --> 22:04.814
Now put on your suit, Tin Man,

22:04.892 --> 22:08.089
I'm throwing my hot stones on the grill
and a porterhouse on your chest!

22:08.162 --> 22:10.892
Could we have some of your
great homemade soup with that?

22:10.965 --> 22:12.830
Soup? What soup?

22:12.900 --> 22:15.562
Oh, no! The boy ate the funk!

22:15.636 --> 22:18.799
Hold on, Jackson,
I'm gonna brew up a pot of anti-funk.

22:21.742 --> 22:23.141
Anti-funk?

22:24.305 --> 22:30.698
