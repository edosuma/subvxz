"Help me out here, doc.

00:02.810 --> 00:04.019
I need a time of death.

00:04.070 --> 00:06.780
" "Sorry, lieutenant, but I can't give you "an official T.O.D.

00:06.830 --> 00:09.280
Until I get her on the slab.

00:09.350 --> 00:13.930
"But based on hypostatic lividity "and degree of rigor, 

00:13.970 --> 00:18.800
I'd say our cheerleader got her pom-poms 
pierced right around halftime.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.300
" Real?Real.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.030
"Anything else?

00:25.080 --> 00:27.590
" "Left-handed assailant, used a single-edged blade,

00:27.630 --> 00:30.290
multiple entry wounds and defensive trauma.

" "So how are we gonna find this psychopath?

00:32.610 --> 00:38.150
" "Well, like our killer, we'll just have to...take a stab at it.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.710
" That's it.

00:47.890 --> 00:50.810
so, you think I'll get the part?

00:51.080 --> 00:57.740
Uh, well, I for one totally buy you as a brilliant forensic investigator.

00:57.780 --> 01:01.530
Thanks, but I believe it's pronounced "fornesic.

01:03.190 --> 01:05.620
" What do you think, charlie?

01:05.760 --> 01:08.050
Unbelievable.

01:09.210 --> 01:12.590
I mean...beyond belief.

01:12.650 --> 01:13.720
That's sweet.

01:13.770 --> 01:14.860
I mean...

01:14.880 --> 01:16.790
I just don't believe it.

01:16.850 --> 01:19.010
You made your point, charlie.

01:19.570 --> 01:22.010
Do you like what I did with the glasses?

01:22.060 --> 01:25.790
On, smart...off, hot.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.580
My mind is just completely blown.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.590
So when are you gonna be on tv?

01:33.660 --> 01:35.440
I have to pass the audition first.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.510
Let's not put the cart before the whores.

01:40.110 --> 01:41.870
Horse.

01:41.930 --> 01:42.590
Maybe a little.

01:42.650 --> 01:45.330
I've been rehearsing all day.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.570
what's the name of the show?

01:50.620 --> 01:53.670
- Stiffs.
- Stiffs?

01:53.710 --> 01:55.550
You know, like dead bodies.

01:55.580 --> 01:57.640
Oh, right.Sure.

01:58.190 --> 02:00.940
I know what you were thinking.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.250
Well, I better go.

02:03.310 --> 02:06.650
The audition's at 4:00 and I still have to get my tan sprayed on.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.680
Best of luck.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.789
It has nothing to do with luck, alan.

02:09.820 --> 02:13.330
You just have to stand still and keep your eyes and mouth closed.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.590
No, I meant...never mind.

02:16.630 --> 02:17.860
Knock 'em dead at the audition.

02:17.900 --> 02:21.080
Thanks.And thanks for lending me your chiropractor coat.

02:21.130 --> 02:23.270
Makes me feel like a real doctor.

02:23.330 --> 02:25.530
Now you know why alan wears it.

02:26.970 --> 02:28.750
Okay, well, uh, tell me how it goes.

02:28.790 --> 02:30.370
I will.

02:30.430 --> 02:31.430
Oh, and by the way.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.100
Did you get the divorce papers?

02:33.130 --> 02:36.950
Not really, but my lawyer explained them to me.Bye.

02:38.310 --> 02:40.720
The-they need to be signed.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.860
Kandi?

02:47.380 --> 02:49.130
hey, what's your hurry?

02:49.190 --> 02:51.410
If she becomes a big tv star while you're still married, 

02:51.460 --> 02:53.110
she'll have to pay you alimony.

02:53.150 --> 02:55.840
Yeah, and if pigs start flying out of my rear end, 

02:55.880 --> 02:59.340
we'll have free bacon for the rest of our lives.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.710
I don't know that I'd eat that bacon.

03:57.140 --> 03:59.500
- Jake?
- Yeah?

04:02.190 --> 04:03.290
what are you doing?

04:03.350 --> 04:05.460
Hanging posters.

04:11.430 --> 04:13.940
Did you consider using scotch tape?

04:13.980 --> 04:15.180
It doesn't hold as well.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.370
Especially her.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.529
Who is that?

04:19.589 --> 04:20.550
Raven.

04:20.589 --> 04:23.860
She's the north american ladies' wrestling champ.

04:23.910 --> 04:30.490
Aha.All oiled up and ready to...wrestle.

04:33.890 --> 04:36.460
damn it!This isn't funny!

04:38.790 --> 04:41.640
Quick little bastards.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.760
What happened to your harry potter posters?

04:44.830 --> 04:46.620
I'm not a kid anymore, dad.

04:46.670 --> 04:48.750
You don't have to be a kid to like harry potter.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.860
You want it, take it.

04:51.140 --> 04:52.260
Aw, harry.

04:52.330 --> 04:53.920
You crumpled harry.

04:53.950 --> 04:55.360
You remember when we got this?

04:55.430 --> 04:56.480
No.

04:56.530 --> 05:00.130
Oh, come on, we stood on line outside that bookstore at midnight 

05:00.180 --> 05:01.620
to get one of the first copies?

05:01.670 --> 05:04.360
You were dressed as harry and I was dressed as dumbledore.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.980
I don't remember, dad.

05:06.610 --> 05:07.730
Sure you do.

05:07.790 --> 05:09.390
You made fun of that other kid 'cause 

05:09.430 --> 05:11.360
he had a flying mop instead of a broom, and, uh, 

05:11.400 --> 05:14.630
he started crying and his father punched me in the chest?

05:15.870 --> 05:17.380
No.

05:17.430 --> 05:20.150
Yeah, well, you weren't the one with the cracked rib.

05:20.410 --> 05:22.840
Anyway, what, uh, what prompted you to...

05:22.880 --> 05:24.890
redecorate like this?

05:24.920 --> 05:27.290
I don't know, I like cars and wrestling.

05:27.340 --> 05:29.850
And wet t-shirts, apparently.

05:30.110 --> 05:31.650
Oh, there is a wet t-shirt on that--

05:31.680 --> 05:33.810
I hadn't noticed.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.560
Jake's redecorating.

05:49.590 --> 05:52.560
Yeah, I can see that.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.400
Oh, raven.

05:56.060 --> 05:57.270
Those are fake, by the way.

05:57.300 --> 06:00.740
- Charlie!
- What?He has a right to know.

06:00.770 --> 06:02.790
I'm just glad the little guy's got me to...

06:02.820 --> 06:04.290
wait a minute.

06:04.350 --> 06:06.100
Are those nails in my wall?

06:06.150 --> 06:08.760
Are you out of your freakin' mind?

06:08.820 --> 06:10.660
No.No?

06:10.710 --> 06:13.140
That's your answer?No?

06:13.470 --> 06:15.290
Yeah.

06:15.310 --> 06:16.980
Charlie...charlie, come on.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.930
For god's sake!

06:18.960 --> 06:21.370
These are railroad spikes!

06:21.620 --> 06:22.550
I'll putty over it.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.050
That's not plaster board, that's stucco.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.180
You can't just putty stucco.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.360
I know, I'll fix it.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.490
Let's just give him some privacy.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.940
Wait, wait, wait.

06:31.510 --> 06:34.440
At least I can take one hammer out of his hand.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.280
Jake, look at daddy.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.760
Look at daddy.

06:40.790 --> 06:42.350
Look at daddy.

06:42.390 --> 06:44.620
Ah, that's my boy.Where's daddy?

06:44.690 --> 06:46.090
Daddy's over here.

06:46.150 --> 06:48.210
Wasn't he adorable?

06:48.250 --> 06:50.010
Yeah.

06:50.150 --> 06:53.050
Hey, could you rewind to judith breast-feeding him?

06:55.460 --> 06:58.010
That was really adorable.

07:00.380 --> 07:03.430
Especially the part where she does the old switcheroo.

07:11.870 --> 07:13.690
I miss that little boy.

07:13.730 --> 07:17.270
Seems like only yesterday I could hold him in one arm.

07:17.330 --> 07:20.550
He didn't weigh more than eight or nine pounds.

07:20.590 --> 07:23.100
He craps more than that now.

07:28.140 --> 07:29.800
Where did the time go?

07:29.840 --> 07:32.960
His childhood is almost over and there's still 

07:32.990 --> 07:34.820
so much stuff I want to do with him.

07:34.860 --> 07:35.810
Like what?

07:35.840 --> 07:38.050
You know, father-son stuff.

07:38.930 --> 07:42.400
Pretty soon, there'll be no more playing catch or riding bikes.

07:42.430 --> 07:47.010
Do you realize I've never even taken him fishing or camping or hunting?

07:47.030 --> 07:50.850
Do you know how to fish or camp or hunt?

07:51.730 --> 07:54.220
That's not the point.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.340
I-I-I thought we would learn together.

07:56.360 --> 07:57.520
Oh, that sounds good.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.640
You and knucklehead out in the woods 

07:58.670 --> 08:01.870
taking turns shooting each other in the ass.

08:06.990 --> 08:09.710
Okay, it's not so much about hunting, per se.

08:09.730 --> 08:12.550
"Per se." There's an outdoorsy phrase.

08:13.020 --> 08:15.180
It's about bonding.

08:15.230 --> 08:18.710
Before you know it, he'll have no interest in spending time with me at all.

08:18.750 --> 08:21.530
Not unless you grow boobs and straddle a harley.

08:24.590 --> 08:25.370
All right, look.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.840
It doesn't help to whine about it.

08:26.870 --> 08:31.950
If you want to get lost in the woods with jerky gherkinheimer, go do it.

08:32.450 --> 08:35.450
My life is just one big joke to you, isn't it?

08:35.490 --> 08:38.070
Actually, it's more of a limerick.

08:39.850 --> 08:45.460
There once was a moron named al, who wanted to camp with his pal...

08:46.920 --> 08:50.600
any chance you can go camping in nantucket?

08:57.840 --> 09:00.640
So, charlie, where's the wife and kid?

09:00.670 --> 09:04.870
They went camping to do some father-son bonding.

09:20.910 --> 09:26.500
alan: And when they looked at the door handle of the car, 

09:26.560 --> 09:28.960
there was nothing there...

09:29.000 --> 09:31.820
but a hook.

09:31.980 --> 09:35.090
A hook?That makes no sense.

09:35.140 --> 09:37.100
Oh, I left out a part.

09:37.130 --> 09:39.860
Um, uh, okay, the guy who escaped from the insane asylum 

09:39.890 --> 09:42.520
had lost his hand in some kind of an industrial accident.

09:42.570 --> 09:46.170
Anyway, they replaced it with a sharp metal hook.

09:46.930 --> 09:53.680
And it was said hook that was stuck on the aforementioned door handle.

09:58.750 --> 10:03.770
dad, over the past three birthdays I've gotten $175 in bookstore gift cards.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.830
They're yours if we can just go home.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.860
No, no, we're having fun.

10:08.910 --> 10:12.010
Hey, I know-- we'll sing a song.

10:12.200 --> 10:18.160
On top of spaghetti all covered with cheese 

10:18.200 --> 10:20.010
come on, you used to love this one.

10:20.050 --> 10:31.800
I lost my poor meatball when somebody sneezed it rolled off the table and...

10:31.820 --> 10:34.000
onto the floor!

10:34.050 --> 10:35.480
come on!

10:35.520 --> 10:41.710
And then my poor meatball rolled right out the door.

10:42.900 --> 10:46.130
Oh, come on.We had an adventure.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.930
- Dad...
- yeah, buddy?

10:51.960 --> 10:54.260
Bite me.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.690
You'll see.Someday you and and I will look back

10:59.730 --> 11:04.240
 on this weekend and laugh and laugh...

11:07.810 --> 11:10.920
I didn't say someday soon.

11:12.210 --> 11:13.050
Hey, come on.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.120
I thought you liked wet t-shirts.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.010
Hey.Hey.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.560
Shut up.

11:35.180 --> 11:38.260
Oh, come on, alan.We both know I can't do that.

11:39.550 --> 11:41.430
What do you want me to say, that it was a bad idea?

11:41.480 --> 11:43.400
Okay, it was a bad idea.

11:43.450 --> 11:46.250
And the only thing we bonded over was our mutual discomfort 

11:46.290 --> 11:48.950
with pooping into a coffee can.

11:49.620 --> 11:52.370
It wasn't chock full o' nuts, was it?

11:54.890 --> 11:57.480
Sorry, sorry.Where's jake?

11:57.540 --> 12:00.580
He went back to his friends in hooterville.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.270
Well, I can't blame him.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.060
It never rains in hooterville.

12:09.590 --> 12:13.660
Look, alan, seriously, I'm, I'm sorry it didn't work out.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.280
I know your heart was in the right place.

12:15.310 --> 12:16.330
Thank you.

12:16.380 --> 12:19.930
Now, I finished the limerick.You want to hear it?

12:21.740 --> 12:24.210
Too soon?

12:24.630 --> 12:25.640
You don't get it.

12:25.690 --> 12:28.620
You don't understand what it's like to be a little boy's best friend, 

12:28.630 --> 12:30.420
to be someone he looks up to, 

12:30.450 --> 12:32.230
and then one day you turn around 

12:32.270 --> 12:34.730
and the only person he looks up to is covered with baby oil 

12:34.760 --> 12:37.230
and nailed to the ceiling.

12:37.350 --> 12:38.340
Count your blessings.

12:38.370 --> 12:40.470
There's all kinds of pictures that could have been up there.

12:40.490 --> 12:41.480
Yeah, I guess.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.450
It could have been the moscow ballet.

12:45.110 --> 12:46.900
I got it.Still, 

12:46.930 --> 12:48.770
I can't help but feel a little empty inside, 

12:48.810 --> 12:52.280
like, like a chapter of my life is over.

12:52.310 --> 12:55.240
So?You've still got plenty to look forward to.

12:55.290 --> 12:58.740
You mean, besides work, loneliness and death?

12:59.500 --> 13:01.160
Absolutely.

13:01.210 --> 13:04.650
There's memory loss...

13:06.320 --> 13:11.980
impotence, adult diapers.

13:12.790 --> 13:15.610
I'm all you've got, pal.

13:19.810 --> 13:21.070
Thatssrue.

13:21.120 --> 13:27.210
O my wives are gone, my son is grown, but I'll always have you...

13:28.030 --> 13:31.260
my brother.

13:33.990 --> 13:37.040
Forever.

13:37.940 --> 13:41.410
Okay, now, I was just having fun, but that was mean.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.750
Well, when will he be back?

13:47.770 --> 13:50.730
All right, tell him I called again.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.140
Boy, some agent.

13:52.180 --> 13:54.560
He never calls, he never returns my calls.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.670
I'm almost sorry I let him feel me up.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.590
I guess that's showbiz.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.020
That's what he said.

14:04.650 --> 14:05.810
Uh, listen, kandi...

14:05.830 --> 14:07.900
I really thought they liked me at that audition.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.760
They had me read three times, and then all the jumping jacks.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.670
Jumping jacks?

14:11.720 --> 14:13.220
It's an action series, alan.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.390
They need to know that I'm fit.

14:16.040 --> 14:21.100
Ah.Uh, listen, kandi, there's something I wanted to talk to you about.

14:21.150 --> 14:23.710
If it's about the divorce papers I haven't signed them yet.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.820
No, no, that's not why I'm here.

14:25.850 --> 14:28.780
Um, sweetie, do you remember why we split up?

14:28.840 --> 14:30.900
The big reason or all the little reasons?

14:30.940 --> 14:33.490
'Cause there were a lot of little reasons, alan.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.470
I know.

14:34.530 --> 14:36.620
Like the way yd d toenaienen grow all crazy.

14:36.670 --> 14:40.050
- Right.Got it.
- And your ear hair and your nose hair.

14:40.100 --> 14:43.640
And that one long hair on your back, yuck!

14:44.370 --> 14:45.670
Wait, forget the little reasons.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.170
Just, just the big one.

14:47.210 --> 14:49.650
Yeah, you didn't want to have a baby, and I did.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.540
Right.Well, what would you say if I were to tell you 

14:53.570 --> 14:58.040
that I've changed my mind about that?

14:58.610 --> 15:00.100
- Really?
- Yeah, 

15:00.150 --> 15:03.530
I've just been thinking that jake is almost grown 

15:03.570 --> 15:07.910
and there's still a lot of daddy left in me.

15:08.390 --> 15:10.620
So you want to have a baby?

15:10.660 --> 15:11.960
Yes, I do.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.200
A fresh start, a-a-a new chapter.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.340
Wow, that's a big step.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.930
Yeah, I know.I know it is.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.480
So if you want to think about it...

15:20.510 --> 15:23.560
no, that's okay.Let's make a baby.

15:23.630 --> 15:24.720
Just like that?

15:24.760 --> 15:26.130
Don't you want to talk about it some more?

15:26.180 --> 15:29.820
Alan, it's practically all we talked about our entire marriage.

15:29.870 --> 15:35.290
Baby, baby, toenails, baby, ear hair, baby, how clocks work, baby.

15:37.420 --> 15:40.640
so...so you really want to do this?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.910
Do what?

15:44.970 --> 15:48.390
You see, if you use tape, it's much easier to rotate 

15:48.430 --> 15:52.090
in new posters when these ones stop working for you.

15:52.130 --> 15:54.390
I don't think that's gonna happen.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.170
Trust me.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.610
After a while, these beautiful eyes are gonna be 

15:57.640 --> 16:00.600
filled with judgment and conddnation.

16:00.770 --> 16:02.710
What are you talking about?

16:03.160 --> 16:05.360
Okay, maybe that was just me.

16:06.690 --> 16:10.880
Anyway, you're lucky your dad lets you hang posters like this.

16:10.910 --> 16:12.310
I guess.

16:12.350 --> 16:13.520
Does your mother let you?

16:13.550 --> 16:14.790
No way.

16:14.810 --> 16:17.970
So what do you got at her house, a secret stash of magazines?

16:18.000 --> 16:21.840
Just one.Playboy 1998, the christmas issue.

16:21.870 --> 16:23.720
God bless hugh hefner, huh?

16:23.740 --> 16:28.730
God bless kimberly macadoo from portland, oregon born march 4, 1979.

16:28.770 --> 16:33.790
Sunshine and goatees.Judgmental people and war.

16:34.270 --> 16:37.090
Gotta love a chick who doesn't like war.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.070
Tape me.

16:39.690 --> 16:42.580
Hey, uncle charlie, could you do me a favor?

16:42.610 --> 16:43.890
If it's the favor I'm thinking of, 

16:43.930 --> 16:47.290
not until you're 18 and not in my house.

16:47.740 --> 16:48.810
What?

16:48.860 --> 16:51.090
Nothing, nothing.What do you need?

16:51.150 --> 16:53.440
Could you get my dad to lay off the father-son stuff?

16:53.480 --> 16:55.250
It's kinda lame.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.600
Lame?

16:56.630 --> 16:58.440
You think it's lame your father cares so much about 

16:58.480 --> 17:01.430
you he wants nothing more than to be part of your life?

17:01.470 --> 17:03.250
Yeah.

17:04.010 --> 17:07.280
Look, you gotta understand what your father's going through.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.220
What do you mean?

17:09.270 --> 17:12.819
Okay, here's the deal.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.369
Your father has reached a very difficult age.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.790
It's confusing and a little bit scary for him.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.720
Scary how?

17:20.760 --> 17:23.609
Well, first of all, his body's changing.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.270
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

17:25.329 --> 17:28.400
Hair is growing where it's never grown before.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.750
That is scary.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.110
And then there's the hormones.

17:32.150 --> 17:32.740
Hormones?

17:32.800 --> 17:36.680
Yep, your father is running out of them.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.770
Sounds bad.

17:38.820 --> 17:42.580
No, no, it's just a perfectly natural part of growing old, jake.

17:42.620 --> 17:43.720
Is it happening to you?

17:43.770 --> 17:46.280
No, no, no.

17:47.330 --> 17:50.050
My point is that your father is going through 

17:50.110 --> 17:53.650
this phase and you have to be patient and understanding.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.590
So he's gonna want to go camping again?

17:56.880 --> 17:59.300
Probably not in this lifetime.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.830
But you might have to play catch with him or something.

18:03.870 --> 18:05.630
Guess I could do that.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.320
Atta boy.

18:07.380 --> 18:11.260
All right, well, I'm glad we had this little talk.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.780
Now I'm gonna go get hammered.

18:30.570 --> 18:34.150
: Hello, ladies, I'm harry potter.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.520
Is there anything special we have to do?

18:39.580 --> 18:41.050
Oh, no, no.It's just like regular sex,

18:41.100 --> 18:43.320
 but without all the last-minute fumbling for a condom.

18:43.360 --> 18:47.450
Oh, okay, but I still get all the rest of the fumbling, right?

18:48.340 --> 18:50.760
I prefer to call that "foreplay.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.800
" hold on.

18:54.850 --> 18:56.380
Hello.

18:56.410 --> 18:57.750
This is she.

18:57.810 --> 19:02.210
Uh-huh.Hold on a sec.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.470
Here, we're divorced.

19:06.890 --> 19:09.170
Okay, I'm back.You were saying?

19:09.210 --> 19:12.140
Really?I got the part?

19:12.180 --> 19:13.990
Thank you so much.

19:14.040 --> 19:17.040
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.550
Alan, I got the part.

19:18.580 --> 19:19.980
Oh, that's terrific.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.250
Congratulations.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.880
Put that thing away.

19:24.930 --> 19:25.930
But I-I thought...

19:25.970 --> 19:30.860
oh, please, nobody wants to see a pregnant fornesic investigator.

19:34.390 --> 19:37.060
Hey, can we still do it with a condom?

19:39.910 --> 19:43.100
Hey, dad, after this, want to go play catch?

19:43.850 --> 19:45.360
it's dark out.

19:45.410 --> 19:48.990
Okay.I tried.

19:50.330 --> 19:52.240
Help me out here, doc.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.330
I need a time of death for our little cheerleader.

19:54.380 --> 19:56.080
 I can't give you an official T.O.D.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.050
Until I get her on the slab.

19:58.110 --> 20:01.000
But based on hypostatic lividity and degree of rigor, 

20:01.040 --> 20:04.450
I'd say our cheerleader got her pom-poms pierced right around halftime.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.710
Anything else?

20:05.780 --> 20:08.190
Left-handed assailant, used a single-edge blade, 

20:08.220 --> 20:10.630
multiple entry wounds and defensive trauma.

20:10.660 --> 20:12.960
So how are we gonna find this psychopath?

20:13.020 --> 20:18.230
Well, like our killer, we'll just have to take a stab at it.

20:25.620 --> 20:31.540
Unbelivable.Yeah.

20:31.580 --> 20:33.820
They're real, you know.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.670
I know, I was married to her.

20:40.710 --> 20:44.750
Oh, yeah.Dawg!

20:53.470 --> 20:56.840
You know what?I'll be in my room.

21:04.820 --> 21:07.120
When are you guys going fishing?
