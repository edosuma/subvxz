00:20.562 --> 00:23.064
Hey, this isn't tight enough.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.817
-Right. Sorry about that.
-And look there.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.278
That jack's in the wrong position, man.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.488
Someone could get hurt.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.074
I already explained this to you.

00:33.908 --> 00:36.077
Why can't you do anything right, huh?

00:36.161 --> 00:37.287
I'm sorry.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.205
SUMIRE

00:39.289 --> 00:42.625
Kato keeps riding my ass
like I'm a stupid newbie.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.963
I can't work every day of the week
with no time off.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.591
I'm not like my dad.
He died from working too much.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.511
I'm doing this now,
but once I get enough money,

00:53.595 --> 00:55.221
I'm gonna take some courses,

00:55.305 --> 00:56.806
and I'll quit that dump.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.600
Then I'll do something really worthwhile.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.185
I'm sorry you feel like that.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.648
I plan to keep on
working hard at that dump.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.817
I like it there.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.111
Oh. I didn't…

01:10.195 --> 01:13.156
Kato keeps riding you
because you have a bad attitude.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.118
You might learn to do the job right
before shitting on it.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.497
Sure, it might not be
the most exciting job,

01:20.580 --> 01:24.167
but I work my ass off every single day,
get my paycheck,

01:24.751 --> 01:26.503
and go home to my grateful family.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.507
Has anyone ever
been grateful to you for anything?

01:38.598 --> 01:39.891
Hurry up now.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.976
-Move it.
-Yes, sir.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.729
I'll take off the splash shield.
You remove the jack.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.231
Yes, sir.

02:07.043 --> 02:07.961
Get him out!

02:08.044 --> 02:10.004
Hey, move! Get the car up!

02:10.088 --> 02:11.422
-Okay, go!
-Get it up!

02:11.506 --> 02:12.507
Get it up!

02:12.590 --> 02:14.134
-A whole turn!
-Hang on, Kato!

02:14.217 --> 02:16.469
-It's up! Hang on, almost there.
-Okay!

02:16.553 --> 02:18.138
-It's up. It's up.
-Kato, you okay?

02:18.221 --> 02:19.430
-Move it. Move!
-Come on.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.640
-Easy. Easy…
-Okay.

02:20.723 --> 02:21.724
-Get him out.
-Come on.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.018
Easy.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.311
You're okay.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.354
-It's okay.
-Ugh!

02:26.437 --> 02:28.857
-Don't stand there! Call an ambulance!
-Are you all right?

02:28.940 --> 02:30.108
-Are you okay?
-Kato!

02:30.191 --> 02:31.484
-Kato!
-Look at his arm!

02:33.027 --> 02:34.362
The jack slipped!

02:35.196 --> 02:36.656
-Kato, hey!
-Hang in there, man!

02:36.739 --> 02:38.741
Hold it! Easy. Easy. Don't try to get up.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.493
<i>Kato decided to quit.</i>

02:42.120 --> 02:43.079
Why?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.124
What do you think? He has no choice.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.669
His hand is completely useless now.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.133
You should leave. Get out!

03:01.181 --> 03:02.849
-Thank you.
-There it is.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.518
-Yeah.
-Guys, break out those shocks.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.686
-You know the ones?
-Anyway…

03:06.769 --> 03:10.857
-I don't know when he's coming back.
-Do you know, uh… <i>if </i>he's coming back?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.533
-It kind of slipped out, man.
-Yeah.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.785
That Tatta is an idiot.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.330
I don't know. I don't know if…

03:28.499 --> 03:31.211
-…they rushed him to the hospital…
-He's all right…

05:11.894 --> 05:14.272
<i>Nine minutes remain.</i>

05:14.355 --> 05:17.567
<i>The King of Clubs team is leading</i>
<i>by 500 points.</i>

05:44.761 --> 05:46.804
Aah! You bastard!

05:46.888 --> 05:49.724
What the fuck are you doing?

05:49.807 --> 05:52.018
I just wanted to have a little fun
with your girlfriend

05:52.101 --> 05:53.436
before this stupid game was over!

05:54.562 --> 05:55.897
You asshole!

05:57.523 --> 05:59.567
Sure, you act like a hero.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.195
But I know you're just like me!

06:02.278 --> 06:05.114
I fucking hate how you walk around
like you're full of hope.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.743
Except now I can finally see
that hope draining out of you.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.412
And I'll die happy
knowing how pathetic you are.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.597
Eight minutes left.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.975
Seems like the enemy is laying low.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.562
It's over, I guess.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.400
What a letdown, huh?

06:40.483 --> 06:41.984
That's just how the game goes.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.278
There's no time left
for them to do anything.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.783
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.807
This feels like an eternity.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.102
Just waiting here to die.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.998
Arisu. I'm sorry.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.791
I couldn't fight.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.919
I couldn't help you in the end.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.504
Usagi,

07:44.297 --> 07:45.840
I should apologize to you.

07:46.841 --> 07:47.967
I'm sorry.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.988
<i>I'm sure</i>

08:10.198 --> 08:12.366
if we went back, I'd still hate it there.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.327
No, staying here won't change that.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.745
Usagi--

08:17.371 --> 08:20.208
You can't push people
into following you for no reason.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.627
You have to be ready to listen.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.171
Wait for them to come to you.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.468
<i>Seven minutes remain.</i>

08:55.451 --> 08:56.827
You decided to come.

08:59.664 --> 09:03.209
Something told me
that I would see you here.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.840
Something told me the same thing.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.594
That's why I came.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.139
To see if you might be
waiting for me here.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.228
The ocean is wide.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.898
That's why we're drawn to it.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.402
We want to commune
with something bigger than we are.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.956
Your team beat ours.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.963
So do you have any regrets?

09:51.799 --> 09:52.967
To be honest,

09:54.719 --> 09:56.596
I'm a bit disappointed.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.058
<i>Five minutes remain.</i>

10:04.312 --> 10:06.063
Please, tell me, Kyuma.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.819
I need to know the answer.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.739
Before I die.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.992
You know that I can't.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.828
You've given up.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.459
I thought you'd say that.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.675
Well, then…

10:36.802 --> 10:38.179
what about

10:39.388 --> 10:41.515
one last handshake

10:42.516 --> 10:43.726
before I go?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.104
What would you say to that?

10:48.397 --> 10:49.565
Handshake?

10:50.316 --> 10:51.901
The game isn't over yet.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.487
If we shake hands now,

10:54.987 --> 10:56.989
we would have to battle, and I'd win.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.373
I finally realized something about myself,

11:08.334 --> 11:09.669
because of what you said.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.964
I should have been ready to listen.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.427
I should have waited
for them to come to me.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.014
Let them know they could depend on me.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.811
And maybe we could've

11:27.311 --> 11:29.522
understood each other
a little better then.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.988
I know we're enemies.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.077
You're my opponent.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.500
And I know it might seem
like I'm being crazy.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.590
But I still really want to say thank you.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.721
Thank you for helping me
realize those things.

12:07.768 --> 12:12.356
I know that… I don't have much time left
to do anything else.

12:15.609 --> 12:17.069
I know I'm gonna die.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.489
So please,

12:23.367 --> 12:25.369
let me shake the hand of the one…

12:26.871 --> 12:29.081
…who showed me my true self.

12:44.555 --> 12:45.389
All right.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.101
Since it's my opponent's dying wish,

12:49.977 --> 12:51.687
I'd be honored to grant it to you.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.485
Thank you, Kyuma.

12:59.361 --> 13:00.362
Arisu.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.532
Getting to battle with you

13:04.658 --> 13:05.993
was a great pleasure.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.842
<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

13:25.513 --> 13:26.680
Uh… huh?

13:27.264 --> 13:28.349
Huh?

13:32.436 --> 13:33.729
Is this for real?

13:35.189 --> 13:38.192
<i>The player team is leading</i>
<i>by 500 points.</i>

13:38.275 --> 13:41.070
KYUMA: 14,000 LOSE
ARISU & TATTA: 14,950 WIN

13:46.033 --> 13:47.201
What?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.746
14,950 points?

13:52.206 --> 13:53.582
What kind of trick is this?

13:54.917 --> 13:56.460
It's not a trick at all.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.804
<i>Seven minutes remain.</i>

14:45.593 --> 14:47.845
What are you doing? Stop it!

14:47.928 --> 14:49.555
Getting the wristband off of me!

14:49.638 --> 14:50.723
Stop!

14:54.351 --> 14:56.604
It's no use.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.064
I can't get it off.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.568
Pathetic.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.654
Arisu.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.282
You gotta do it.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.535
What do you mean, get it off?

15:12.620 --> 15:15.331
Well, I figured out a plan.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.625
There's 10,100 points here.

15:18.626 --> 15:22.379
If you hold onto it hidden in your pocket,
it'll be like there's two of us.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.466
Then our team might be able
to win that way.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.344
Tatta, I can't. No!

15:29.136 --> 15:31.889
They never said anything
about taking the wristband off.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.353
Please, Arisu!

15:39.772 --> 15:41.231
I don't think I can do it.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.859
Please, there's no time!

15:44.526 --> 15:45.736
Do it for me!

15:56.455 --> 15:58.165
We can win this way.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.212
Everybody's life is on the line here!

16:03.295 --> 16:04.296
What are you waiting for?

16:04.380 --> 16:06.882
<i>Six minutes remain.</i>

16:08.300 --> 16:09.426
Otherwise everyone will die!

16:12.262 --> 16:13.347
Arisu!

16:14.556 --> 16:15.391
Do it!

16:18.102 --> 16:20.813
You've just gotta do it, okay? Hurry!

16:21.605 --> 16:22.648
I can't.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.527
Please, or you'll kill everyone!
Do it for them!

16:28.278 --> 16:29.363
Just go!

16:30.531 --> 16:31.573
Do it!

16:34.118 --> 16:35.202
Arisu!

16:37.413 --> 16:38.747
Do it!

17:10.571 --> 17:11.697
Tatta!

17:11.780 --> 17:12.948
I'm sorry.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.408
I'm sorry!

17:14.992 --> 17:16.160
No.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.203
I'm sorry I made you do it.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.122
I'm sure it was hard.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.798
-Quick, take it.
-I've gotta stop the bleeding!

17:29.882 --> 17:31.300
Just take it!

17:42.853 --> 17:43.937
Arisu.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.733
Remember when you thanked me earlier?

17:49.568 --> 17:51.278
I felt so much joy.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.032
It was like

17:55.908 --> 17:57.367
I was the hero for once.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.830
I promise I'll be fine.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.999
Don't worry, I'm not gonna die from this.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.629
Hurry up, or everyone else will die!

18:08.712 --> 18:10.339
Go on!

18:12.758 --> 18:13.842
Go!

18:14.635 --> 18:15.469
Just go!

18:38.450 --> 18:40.369
Whoa…

18:42.538 --> 18:45.749
You are way more screwed up
than I thought.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.546
I won the game, thanks to my friend.

18:54.258 --> 18:57.678
Wow. I guess we finally lost the game.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.226
So even someone as wise as you

19:06.061 --> 19:07.771
is still afraid of death?

19:09.314 --> 19:10.399
No.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.653
I'm thinking about my friend Shitara,
who died earlier.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.868
He said that if I let him die in vain,

19:22.244 --> 19:24.496
he'd beat the shit out of me
in the afterlife,

19:24.580 --> 19:25.914
and I know he meant it.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.210
And all my teammates
are gonna be disappointed in me.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.175
I'm sorry.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.848
You were the one who set the tone.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.436
We were all equals in this game,
and we gave everything.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.813
With all our hearts.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.567
I've never had this much passion
for anything.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.946
And you showed me how.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.533
Kyuma,

20:03.202 --> 20:05.829
you guys were a team before this,
weren't you?

20:11.543 --> 20:13.420
Kyuma, you asshole.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.382
I guess he dropped his guard
right at the end.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.221
Well, aren't you the one to talk?

20:23.931 --> 20:25.641
Yeah, you're right.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.018
Without Kyuma,

20:28.894 --> 20:32.147
none of our sorry asses
would have made it this far in the game.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.692
We can't hold him responsible
for anything.

20:36.860 --> 20:37.986
That's right.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.657
Thanks, Kyuma.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.576
It was pretty fun.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.790
We'll do some more stupid shit
on the other side.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.134
<i>Kyuma.</i>

21:02.427 --> 21:05.931
<i>You love your friends</i>
<i>as much as I love mine.</i>

21:08.267 --> 21:11.603
And with every single game,
you kept on risking your lives.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.356
But you kept winning,

21:15.899 --> 21:17.192
and progressing more.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.320
We're all doing the same thing.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.407
Everyone just wants to stop
playing the game.

21:26.702 --> 21:27.911
Isn't that right?

21:33.583 --> 21:35.752
But it seems like,
even if you win them all,

21:36.586 --> 21:39.089
you still just become
citizens of Borderland.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.425
So do we get to go back
to where we came from?

21:44.845 --> 21:46.096
Tell me the truth.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.933
Do we get to go back?

21:56.815 --> 21:58.900
If that's what your intuition is saying,

22:00.402 --> 22:02.154
then maybe that's your truth.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.329
What kind of an answer is that?

22:14.791 --> 22:16.293
Come on, man.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.386
So there's…

22:28.263 --> 22:30.599
there's no point
in playing any of these games.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.977
Do you think you'll find out
if you stop playing?

22:38.732 --> 22:40.692
Well, what is it all supposed to mean?

22:46.948 --> 22:48.367
I don't think I can do it.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.581
I'm never gonna be as strong as you are.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.168
You'll never be like me, Arisu,

22:58.877 --> 23:00.295
and you shouldn't want that.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.757
You're playing your own game.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.760
You're the master of your own fate.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.100
<i>No time remains.</i>

23:13.809 --> 23:19.398
<i>It is game over for the King of Clubs</i>
<i>team, as they ended with fewer points.</i>

23:19.898 --> 23:20.899
Arisu.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.319
Good luck to you.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.704
I don't want you to die!

23:38.125 --> 23:39.584
When we first met,

23:40.419 --> 23:42.629
we knew that one of us was going to die.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.007
If we hadn't met playing this game,
who's to say--

23:46.091 --> 23:48.510
The only reason we became this close

23:49.428 --> 23:51.346
was because we met playing the game.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.268
But if we had met somewhere else,

23:59.354 --> 24:01.815
then maybe we could have
actually been friends.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.737
We've been friends this whole time.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.408
Arisu.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.078
I hope you figure it out.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.082
How to live by your own rules.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.418
Your life is yours.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.504
Don't follow someone else's path.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.642
It was an honor playing with you.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.367
So this is the end.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.787
I had a great life.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.836
I lived it without a single regret.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.718
And I know that I'm ready to die.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.138
Kyuma.

25:59.516 --> 26:02.185
<i>The player team wins.</i>

26:52.861 --> 26:54.904
Usagi? Usagi!

27:01.244 --> 27:02.370
Kuina.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.247
We won.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.627
What? Really?

27:11.880 --> 27:13.006
PLAYER TEAM
CONGRATULATIONS

27:13.089 --> 27:15.342
Arisu must have saved us somehow.

27:19.262 --> 27:20.221
We won?

27:30.231 --> 27:31.775
Tatta, are you okay?

27:31.858 --> 27:32.984
Tatta!

27:33.485 --> 27:34.486
Hang on, Tatta!

27:40.158 --> 27:41.368
Just hang on.

27:44.245 --> 27:45.288
Tatta.

27:49.459 --> 27:50.543
Tatta.

27:53.421 --> 27:54.255
Tatta,

27:55.340 --> 27:56.174
we won.

27:57.550 --> 27:58.593
We won,

27:59.511 --> 28:00.970
and it's all thanks to you.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.848
Sweet.

28:07.435 --> 28:09.521
Hey, come on, Tatta.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.523
Keep it together, all right?

28:12.315 --> 28:13.233
Tatta.

28:15.860 --> 28:16.986
You see?

28:18.863 --> 28:20.073
When I try,

28:21.074 --> 28:21.950
I can

28:23.159 --> 28:24.160
be great.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.997
Yeah. You are great.

28:28.748 --> 28:30.333
We won because of you, Tatta.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.546
Thank you.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.389
Hey, Tatta!

28:45.640 --> 28:47.559
Tatta! Don't go!

28:49.018 --> 28:49.978
Don't you go!

28:50.562 --> 28:51.438
Tatta!

28:52.439 --> 28:53.565
Tatta!

28:53.648 --> 28:56.234
Oh no. Just hang on, Tatta!

28:56.818 --> 28:58.153
Tatta!

28:59.237 --> 29:00.530
Come on!

29:01.114 --> 29:02.282
Tatta!

29:03.491 --> 29:04.659
Tatta!

29:07.328 --> 29:08.580
Tatta,

29:09.622 --> 29:11.040
don't leave me.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.829
It's a pretty view.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.167
This is a nice place to rest.

29:54.876 --> 29:55.960
Yeah.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.432
We can't…

30:11.184 --> 30:13.436
let his death be for nothing.

30:17.565 --> 30:19.234
We need to keep going,

30:20.151 --> 30:22.111
to keep Tatta's memory alive.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.214
I'm so fucking pissed off that I survived,

30:42.257 --> 30:43.800
and it's all because of you.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.387
Even so,

30:49.556 --> 30:51.724
I guess I'm grateful that I'm still alive.

30:58.565 --> 30:59.858
So thank you.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.101
TEIO PRISON

32:13.556 --> 32:19.062
PUT ON A COLLAR AND GO UPSTAIRS
TO THE CENTRAL GUARDROOM

33:23.292 --> 33:25.837
<i>Difficulty level,</i>
<i>Jack of Hearts.</i>

33:28.047 --> 33:30.466
<i>Game, Solitary Confinement.</i>

33:31.467 --> 33:35.930
<i>Rules. Guess the card suit</i>
<i>that appears on the back of your collar.</i>

33:36.472 --> 33:40.309
<i>However, you may not look</i>
<i>at the symbol yourself.</i>

33:42.854 --> 33:44.689
I can't see anything.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.192
<i>The time limit is</i>
<i>one hour per round.</i>

33:48.276 --> 33:53.990
<i>In the final five minutes,</i>
<i>enter your cell and disclose your symbol.</i>

34:11.257 --> 34:16.179
<i>If you do not answer</i>
<i>with the correct symbol, it is game over.</i>

34:16.262 --> 34:19.390
<i>The collar will explode, and you will die.</i>

34:19.474 --> 34:22.602
<i>Additionally,</i>
<i>when the time limit reaches zero,</i>

34:22.685 --> 34:26.481
<i>the symbol on the collar will reset</i>
<i>and change for each round.</i>

34:27.440 --> 34:31.903
Wait a sec. So that means we just have
to ask each other what our symbols are.

34:32.445 --> 34:33.738
That's easy, huh?

34:33.821 --> 34:35.364
I'm not so sure.

34:35.448 --> 34:38.451
They haven't told us
what the conditions to win are yet.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.328
<i>The Solitary Confinement game</i>

34:40.411 --> 34:43.539
<i>is about how much</i>
<i>you can trust your fellow players.</i>

34:43.623 --> 34:47.627
<i>Be aware that your opponent,</i>
<i>the Jack of Hearts,</i>

34:47.710 --> 34:50.296
<i>has already been placed among you.</i>

34:51.756 --> 34:53.049
Oh, that's good.

34:55.468 --> 34:56.886
So one of us

34:58.096 --> 34:59.722
<i>is </i>the Jack of Hearts?

35:01.265 --> 35:02.517
<i>How to win.</i>

35:03.059 --> 35:05.520
<i>Rounds repeat every hour.</i>

35:05.603 --> 35:10.316
<i>You win the game</i>
<i>when the Jack of Hearts dies.</i>

35:13.694 --> 35:15.780
<i>Prohibited actions.</i>

35:15.863 --> 35:19.450
<i>Looking at your symbol</i>
<i>with a reflective surface is cheating.</i>

35:20.076 --> 35:24.664
<i>Players may not use weapons or violence</i>
<i>to kill fellow players.</i>

35:25.665 --> 35:29.127
This means
that the only way this game will ever end

35:29.210 --> 35:32.130
is if the Jack gives the wrong answer.

35:33.005 --> 35:34.423
So, basically,

35:35.258 --> 35:38.970
no one here is getting out alive,
unless they lie to the Jack.

35:39.053 --> 35:41.806
<i>There is no limit</i>
<i>to the number of rounds.</i>

35:41.889 --> 35:43.266
There's no limit?

35:43.808 --> 35:46.727
<i>Enough food has been provided.</i>

35:48.312 --> 35:49.272
What?

35:58.239 --> 36:00.283
<i>While participating in this game,</i>

36:00.366 --> 36:03.578
<i>no days will be removed from your visas.</i>

36:05.329 --> 36:07.331
So we need to start lying,

36:07.415 --> 36:10.168
find the Jack of Hearts,
and kill them off,

36:10.251 --> 36:12.920
or we'll live out the rest of our days
in this prison.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.675
Solitary for life.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.887
<i>The game will now commence.</i>

36:21.429 --> 36:22.513
ROUND ONE

36:22.597 --> 36:26.142
<i>You can roam freely</i>
<i>until it is time to enter your cell.</i>

36:34.775 --> 36:36.319
Is this for real?

36:41.657 --> 36:42.491
Hey, man.

36:43.910 --> 36:46.495
Would you mind telling me
what my symbol is?

36:46.579 --> 36:48.080
And then I can tell you yours.

36:48.623 --> 36:49.582
Okay.

36:50.082 --> 36:53.586
So, the 20 of us
need to eliminate each other

36:53.669 --> 36:57.298
until we somehow figure out
who the Jack of Hearts is.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.761
What makes you think
that anyone is trustworthy?

37:05.765 --> 37:07.433
Do you wanna go downstairs?

37:25.618 --> 37:26.953
I have an idea.

37:27.036 --> 37:30.248
How about we get together
and make teams to tell each other?

37:30.331 --> 37:33.042
So that way, nobody can lie.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.210
Good idea.

37:34.293 --> 37:37.046
Um, would you mind
if I joined up with you?

37:37.129 --> 37:38.381
Me too?

37:38.464 --> 37:40.675
Excuse me. I'd like to join as well.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.636
Sure! The more the merrier!

37:43.719 --> 37:44.887
Can I join too, please?

37:44.971 --> 37:47.598
Hey. I want you to tell me
what my symbol is.

37:47.682 --> 37:48.891
Um… Okay.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.978
Tell me what my symbol is, man.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.105
Go on.

37:54.188 --> 37:55.231
-Uh…
-Huh?

37:56.107 --> 37:58.776
Why, can't you tell me?
Then I'll look at yours.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.236
Huh?

38:03.197 --> 38:04.949
Okay, now tell me mine.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.742
-All right.
-Come on.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.911
Hey, wanna tell each other the answer?

38:10.413 --> 38:12.331
If you're trying to survive,

38:12.415 --> 38:15.376
I would examine all the people here
a little more carefully.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.755
Make sure you keep
the ones who don't lie close.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.176
For all you know,
I'm the one who might be the Jack.

38:26.804 --> 38:27.847
You see?

38:28.347 --> 38:30.474
They all started breaking off into groups.

38:31.017 --> 38:34.478
Everyone wants to know
who's trustworthy and who's not.

38:38.399 --> 38:39.400
Take those two.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.153
Listen.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.280
If you wanna be safe…

38:44.363 --> 38:47.366
Before the game started,
you wanna know what they were doing?

38:57.960 --> 38:59.045
What?

39:00.004 --> 39:03.716
That guy wants to control everything
she does to exert power over her

39:04.717 --> 39:08.054
so that she can't interact
with any of the other players.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.474
Which is smart, in the long run.

39:11.557 --> 39:14.101
If you've got someone
you can trust that much,

39:14.185 --> 39:15.853
that's how you can win the game.

39:15.936 --> 39:16.812
Hey.

39:20.483 --> 39:23.319
-Doesn't look like you have a partner yet.
-Hearts…

39:23.402 --> 39:25.738
Tell me what my symbol is,
and I'll tell you yours.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.698
-I don't know.
-Spades.

39:28.532 --> 39:29.867
Clubs.

39:30.868 --> 39:33.162
That's a pretty aggressive
attitude to take.

39:33.996 --> 39:34.830
Huh?

39:35.831 --> 39:38.834
That kind of childishness
makes you painfully transparent.

39:40.503 --> 39:44.298
You're ashamed of the darkness inside you,
which makes you petty and jealous.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.343
You try to keep yourself safe
behind those bangs.

39:48.344 --> 39:51.806
You hide your face so that
people won't see your ugly, empty soul.

39:53.599 --> 39:58.104
You're a pathetic excuse of a human being
who judges others to feel better.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.609
Pathetic and small.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.070
But that's what I like about you.

40:14.161 --> 40:15.871
We should be friends.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.009
Hey.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.970
Do you wanna join our team?

40:32.471 --> 40:34.223
No pressure or anything.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.308
It's not that I don't want to.

40:37.017 --> 40:39.812
Okay. We'll join the group.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.774
-Do you wanna join us?
-Yes.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.359
Welcome to the group. Welcome.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.572
So I'm gonna go first, okay?

40:50.156 --> 40:52.658
I hope you'll all give me
the right answer.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.870
Oh, Urumi, yours is…

40:55.953 --> 40:56.996
is a heart.

40:57.079 --> 40:58.247
-Heart.
-Heart. Heart.

40:58.330 --> 40:59.248
-Heart. Yes.
-Yeah.

41:00.916 --> 41:04.336
Okay, will you please do mine next?

41:04.420 --> 41:05.463
Yours is a heart too.

41:05.546 --> 41:06.922
-Heart, yes.
-Heart.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.299
Heart.

41:08.382 --> 41:10.259
-Mm-hmm.
-I'll go next.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.305
-You're a spade.
-Yes. Spade.

41:14.388 --> 41:15.890
-It's a spade.
-See, it's a spade.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.184
-Uh, may I go next?
-Sure. Yeah.

41:18.767 --> 41:19.727
-Diamond.
-Diamond?

41:19.810 --> 41:21.437
-Yes, yes, diamond.
-It's a diamond.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.646
Yes, a diamond.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.774
Yes. Diamond. Diamond.

41:25.858 --> 41:26.817
-That's it.
-Mm-hmm.

41:28.319 --> 41:29.653
-Club.
-You're a club. That's it.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.489
-A club, yes. It's a club.
-Club, yes.

41:32.031 --> 41:33.449
Oh, okay, I'll go next.

42:02.102 --> 42:03.062
Diamond.

42:28.837 --> 42:29.838
Wow.

42:30.673 --> 42:32.424
That was so easy.

42:39.723 --> 42:42.810
-Ah, thank goodness!
-Let's do this every round.

42:42.893 --> 42:43.978
Yes.

42:44.436 --> 42:46.522
Oh my gosh. I'm so relieved.

42:46.605 --> 42:47.856
Thank goodness.

42:49.358 --> 42:51.902
<i>Round two begins now.</i>

42:58.367 --> 43:00.869
-Thank you so much. Let's do that again.
-Yes, thank you so much.

43:00.953 --> 43:04.373
-Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.
-Yes, thank you.

43:04.456 --> 43:05.666
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

43:05.749 --> 43:09.086
-An answer!
-Thanks everyone, for being honest.

43:09.169 --> 43:10.421
I feel very relieved.

43:10.504 --> 43:13.882
I keep wondering
how long this is going to go on for.

43:15.217 --> 43:17.761
Either the Jack will start to kill,

43:17.845 --> 43:20.931
or someone who's afraid of the Jack
will start to kill.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.016
…stick together…

43:22.099 --> 43:26.186
Until either or both of those things
happen, this will never end.

43:26.270 --> 43:27.855
Exactly.

43:29.523 --> 43:33.319
As long as we keep being honest
with each other, we'll be all right.

43:34.445 --> 43:35.487
Or not.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.573
What the fuck?

43:39.825 --> 43:42.870
I told you to give me the answer!

43:48.375 --> 43:49.710
You all right?

43:53.213 --> 43:54.715
Tell him he's a club.

44:03.932 --> 44:06.018
Looks to me
like you want another beating.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.770
Huh?

44:08.562 --> 44:10.105
Huh?

44:10.189 --> 44:11.065
Huh?

44:15.444 --> 44:16.695
Give me the answer!

44:17.529 --> 44:19.198
C-- Club.

44:19.281 --> 44:21.700
-Huh?
-Club!

44:30.709 --> 44:32.670
Don't wait so long next time.

44:45.557 --> 44:46.809
Shh!

44:48.560 --> 44:50.729
Now the game is really starting.

45:08.038 --> 45:09.498
Are you all right?

45:11.041 --> 45:11.917
Yeah.

45:12.584 --> 45:15.337
How would you like to join up
with our group instead?

GENKI KIRIU

46:21.195 --> 46:22.905
Oh, I can't believe it.

46:22.988 --> 46:24.198
I know him.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.533
-I'm so scared.
-That bully.

46:27.493 --> 46:30.454
-I wonder who's gonna be next.
-Okay, great.

46:31.413 --> 46:34.583
-Do you think it could be me?
-What? I don't get it.

46:34.666 --> 46:35.876
I don't know.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.544
He hit that guy.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.588
Lo-- look. Someone's missing.

46:40.088 --> 46:42.090
-That big dumb guy, right?
-Is that right?

46:42.174 --> 46:43.509
Yes, yes, it was him, yes.

46:44.092 --> 46:46.261
-Remember, we're a team.
-Yeah.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.473
If we keep
telling the truth, then…

46:49.556 --> 46:51.141
-It was me.
-…everyone will be okay.

46:51.225 --> 46:52.184
Hey.

46:52.267 --> 46:54.144
…what his suit was, that's all…

46:54.228 --> 46:56.688
That guy must be the Jack.

46:57.648 --> 46:58.524
Yeah, I know.

46:58.607 --> 47:02.319
-He lied to that big bully and killed him.
-Someone has to…

47:03.195 --> 47:05.739
-Okay, we stay together.
-I don't know who to trust.

47:05.823 --> 47:09.076
I think we'd better kill him next turn.

47:09.159 --> 47:10.828
-What do you think?
-What?

47:12.454 --> 47:14.248
-You tell me…
-Are you saying…

47:14.331 --> 47:17.793
-…trust each other…
-…we should lie to him?

47:17.876 --> 47:19.962
-How are we supposed to know?
-What…

47:20.045 --> 47:21.338
Of course.

47:21.922 --> 47:24.091
He's definitely the Jack.

47:24.591 --> 47:26.552
And if not, he's still dangerous.

47:27.219 --> 47:30.138
We should eliminate him
while we have the chance.

47:54.162 --> 47:55.789
Next up is, uh…

47:55.873 --> 47:57.207
You!

47:57.291 --> 47:59.126
Okay, great.

47:59.209 --> 48:00.878
Oh, you're a heart.

48:00.961 --> 48:02.421
-Yeah, a heart.
-Yes. Heart.

48:02.504 --> 48:04.381
-Yes, that's a heart.
-Heart. Heart.

48:04.965 --> 48:07.342
-May I go next?
-Yes, yes, please.

48:08.969 --> 48:10.429

-Diamond, yes.
-Diamond.

48:13.015 --> 48:14.766
-That's a diamond.
-It's a diamond.

48:15.517 --> 48:16.852
Can you do mine next?

48:18.729 --> 48:21.523
Looks like your symbol's a spade.

48:22.983 --> 48:24.318
-Uh, yes.
-Mm-hmm.

48:24.401 --> 48:25.569
-Spade. Spade.
-Yes.

48:25.652 --> 48:26.862
-It's a spade.
-Spade.

48:26.945 --> 48:29.114
-Spade.
-Thank you very much.

48:35.203 --> 48:36.246

49:20.874 --> 49:23.335
I guess that guy
wasn't the Jack of Hearts.

49:27.214 --> 49:28.840
See? Told you this would happen.

49:30.509 --> 49:32.344
People are starting to get nervous.

49:32.427 --> 49:34.513
I know they said there was no time limit…

49:36.223 --> 49:39.017
except that people
are actually starting to die now.

49:40.227 --> 49:42.312
I'm not sure we'll find the Jack at all.

50:16.638 --> 50:18.015
That girl there,

50:18.098 --> 50:21.977
she wasn't on our side when we tried
to get our stories straight earlier.

50:23.353 --> 50:25.230
Should we kill her? Hmm?

50:37.242 --> 50:38.618
Please, do mine.

50:40.162 --> 50:41.329
Oh, uh… Diamond.

50:41.413 --> 50:44.458
-Yes. Diamond.
-Diamond. Diamond. It is.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.463
All right, will you do mine next, please?

50:53.133 --> 50:55.093
It looks like your symbol is
