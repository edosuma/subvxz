WEBVTT

00:14.014 --> 00:17.851
Some people never have a chance.

00:17.934 --> 00:20.937
Bad-luck parents, crap schools.

00:21.479 --> 00:25.358
Life gave them lemons and nobody
taught them how to make lemonade.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.905
Some people have it all

00:30.989 --> 00:35.035
and still end up
a worthless piece of shit.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.120
I know my rights.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.455
Here we go.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.041
I haven't been arrested,
I haven't been Mirandized,

00:41.124 --> 00:42.584
and I haven't spoken to my lawyer.

00:42.667 --> 00:47.672
I will just call this you and I having
a chat in a mutual friend's apartment.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.340
And if I try to leave?

00:49.424 --> 00:51.509
We'll see how far you get.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.096
Where is Davos?

00:56.598 --> 00:58.308
-No idea.
-Come on.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.602
Ask Walker.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.145
No idea.

01:02.645 --> 01:05.231
According to Danny,
you delivered him to Davos.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.441
It wasn't like that.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.193
I'm inclined to believe Danny.

01:08.276 --> 01:12.155
Well, he was blacked out on a cocktail
of carfentanil and haloperidol.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.825
But good for you... and your inclinations.

01:19.412 --> 01:23.208
You do not want to test me.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.475
Pull my shirt up.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.894
-[chuckles]
-[Walker] Two inches above the hip.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.021
Come on.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.149
I don't bite.

01:59.744 --> 02:00.995
Serrated blade.

02:03.623 --> 02:07.127
Czech military issue. Demon knife.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.587
<i>Démonový nůž.</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:13.049
Point being, I know
the difference between an idle threat

02:13.133 --> 02:15.176
and someone who's gonna back it up.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.305
Mmm. Walker.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.516
Where did you find her?

02:21.599 --> 02:24.477
Rand has resources.

02:25.019 --> 02:28.565
Why have her cozy up to Danny
with the whole

02:28.648 --> 02:30.525
"just moved here from Wisconsin" act?

02:30.608 --> 02:33.403
It wasn't an act,
and it wasn't intentional. She has DID.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.655
So what you want me to believe

02:35.738 --> 02:40.994
is that you are a different Mary Walker
than the one that met Danny on the street?

02:42.287 --> 02:43.830
[sing-song] Mary.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.082
It was a complication we had to deal with,

02:46.166 --> 02:48.168
she assured me she could bring Danny in,
regardless.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.128
Bring Danny in for the ceremony?

02:50.670 --> 02:52.130
So Davos could get the Fist.

02:52.213 --> 02:56.634
Why don't you outline for me
exactly what that was, step by step?

02:56.718 --> 02:57.719
[chuckles] It's...

03:00.096 --> 03:03.641
It's an ancient ritual
in which the heart of the dragon

03:03.725 --> 03:05.727
is transferred
from one person to the other

03:05.810 --> 03:07.979
through the art of Tebori.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.773
The old-school tattooing, yakuza thing.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.860
These women... [exhales]
they were experts.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.737
Call themselves the Crane Sisters.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.239
Work at a tattoo shop
out in the Iron Triangle.

03:18.323 --> 03:22.368
Davos tracked them down through
his connections in organized crime.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.786
That's about all I know.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.707
[chuckles] You know, from...
what you're telling me,

03:27.790 --> 03:33.838
it sounds like you have just as much
reason to fear Davos as anybody.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.507
So if you know anything,

03:37.175 --> 03:39.928
anything that can bring him in...

03:41.429 --> 03:42.597
give it up.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.307
I've told you everything.

03:45.850 --> 03:50.146
Why choose to be
a worthless piece of shit?

03:52.815 --> 03:55.902
It's easy to judge someone
by their actions...

03:58.947 --> 04:00.949
but it's never that simple, is it?

04:07.330 --> 04:08.957
[theme music playing]

05:23.906 --> 05:26.075
In what world
are you not gonna arrest them?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.661
[Misty] This one, for now. Look...

05:28.745 --> 05:33.333
Walker thinks she's better off with us
than against us, so she'll play ball.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.835
Joy is legitimately scared of Davos.

05:35.918 --> 05:39.172
Okay, I have to say, that is bullshit.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.467
I book them, we have to explain
what happened to Danny.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.886
And then we will be dealing
with a media circus.

05:44.969 --> 05:48.264
So what? I'm just supposed to host
a slumber party for those two?

05:48.348 --> 05:49.599
Misty's right.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.643
If I'm gonna talk Davos down, it's not
gonna be with a news crew behind me.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.312
What do you mean, "talk him down"?

05:54.395 --> 05:57.440
I'm gonna find him.
Convince him to stop all of this.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.401
Yeah, "all of this."
Okay, he is killing people.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.112
Which is exactly why
you should not go and talk to him.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.407
If he wanted me dead, I'd be dead.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.409
You almost were.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.036
But I'm not.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.371
[Ward] Come on, Danny!

06:11.454 --> 06:15.458
These animals cut you, bled you
and left you on a park bench.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.793
I know.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.754
But we're still talking about your sister
and my brother.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.422
I know what I said.

06:23.424 --> 06:27.178
And if Detective Knight here
will not call in the cavalry,

06:27.261 --> 06:28.679
then I'll get on the phone. Okay, do it.

06:30.807 --> 06:34.352
PD will go in, he'll resist,
and they'll take him out.

06:35.812 --> 06:39.440
That's not an option.
There has to be another way.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.485
Okay, if we get the power out of Davos...

06:43.528 --> 06:45.905
can you bring him in then
and lay the charges?

06:45.988 --> 06:49.617
Sure. But how the hell do we do that?

06:50.201 --> 06:51.702
Same way it was done to me.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.164
Okay. We find the women,
the tattoo artists.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.290
The Crane Sisters.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.042
Sounds like a shitty band name.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.379
Yeah, well, that shitty band
helped steal Danny's power.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.382
And they may know
how to make Davos give it back.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.051
All right, so let's track 'em down.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.513
Easy. You're not going anywhere.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.350
[exhales] Look, I'm fine, okay?
Just give me a minute.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.313
[Danny sighs]

07:23.317 --> 07:24.902
Look, I know what you're gonna say to me.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.612
[Colleen] And I know
what you're gonna say.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.782
But right now we need you
to rest and heal up, okay?

07:36.038 --> 07:38.374
You're gonna stay here
and hold things down till we're back?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.418
What, me? I'm not staying here.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.337
Someone's got to keep an eye on Danny
in case he takes a turn.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.591
Well, I'm not a babysitter
for the criminally deranged in there.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.385
Well, you said
you wanted to talk to your sister.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.179
Now you can catch up.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.642
[door opens and closes]

07:57.810 --> 07:59.520
You told Misty
you don't know where Davos is,

07:59.604 --> 08:01.731
but you delivered Danny,
which means you lied.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.358
Yeah. The minute they have Davos,
they're wrapping us up, too.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.235
We cooperate,
there's a chance we plead down.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.570
Yeah, in fairyland.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.657
How much are you worth? Liquid.
How much could you move today?

08:11.741 --> 08:14.619
Some, not much. Almost everything
is tied up in investments.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.412
-[groans]
-You're gonna get your money.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.456
-Don't worry about it.
-That's not what I'm saying.

08:18.539 --> 08:21.501
There's a fire escape off this deck,
puts us in an alley off Henry Street.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.086
-How are you gonna get down a fire escape?
-Hold, please.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.132
[chuckles in disbelief]

08:29.717 --> 08:33.387
I'm gonna go, and I suggest you pull all
the resources you can and do the same.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.474
No, I told you, I can't run.
I'm not gonna run.

08:36.557 --> 08:40.645
Well, either your pals in there
arrest Davos and you go down with him,

08:40.728 --> 08:44.982
or they don't, and one day
that sick bastard is gonna come knocking.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.736
Before they picked us up,
you had a different idea.

08:48.819 --> 08:52.281
One that removed Davos
from the equation entirely. Right?

08:54.033 --> 08:56.953
-But you took that approach off the table.
-Yeah, I did.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.872
And then he started killing people.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.881
[indistinct shouting and groaning]

09:11.968 --> 09:13.844
[glass shatters]

09:28.568 --> 09:31.279
Hey. How'd it go in there?

09:31.362 --> 09:34.574
Sounded, you know, like a success.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.079
I crossed these three names off the list.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.123
Who's next?

09:42.665 --> 09:44.000
"Who's next?"

09:45.167 --> 09:47.670
We should go get a bite.
I know this great place over on Mulberry

09:47.753 --> 09:50.339
that does an incredible veal rollatini
with black truffle glaze.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.465
I don't eat meat.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.469
Killing animals for sustenance
is a disgrace.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.306
[Chen] Of course you don't.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.643
You're just a vegetarian
that kills people.

10:05.229 --> 10:08.316
[sighs] I can't believe
that I've been beating myself up

10:08.399 --> 10:12.111
while she was the one
who was plotting and conspiring.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.947
[groans and chuckles]

10:15.698 --> 10:18.326
She let me think
that I was the crazy one.

10:19.535 --> 10:20.536
[Danny] Ward.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.915
I'm angry, too.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.208
I'm hurt.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.127
And I'm confused.

10:29.420 --> 10:34.175
But if I linger in that,
I'm giving myself over to those emotions.

10:35.426 --> 10:40.848
Instead, I'm trying to find my center,
which I can't do if you're talking.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.559
When you talk about that chi stuff,

10:43.643 --> 10:48.272
I want to rip your arms off
and shove them down your throat.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.108
[chuckles] That was a good one.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.819
-Come on. Meditate with me.
-[door opens]

10:54.570 --> 10:56.364
-You'll feel better.
-[door closes]

10:56.447 --> 10:58.574
-Hello, boys.
-What the hell?

11:00.785 --> 11:03.287
Hey. You keep your distance.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.707
You wanna talk to Davos,
I'll take you to him.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.627
You did that already.
Didn't go so well for Danny.

11:09.710 --> 11:10.711
What do you want, Walker?

11:10.795 --> 11:15.466
I can take you to Davos. But just you.
Not your girlfriend. Not the detective.

11:15.549 --> 11:18.719
If you pay me enough to take off
and stay gone.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.514
What's to stop you from taking off
the minute we're outside?

11:21.597 --> 11:24.350
If I wanted to go, I'd go.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.103
She's got a point.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.063
I need to see Davos.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.191
What would you even say to him?

11:33.234 --> 11:34.193
Look, I don't know.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.196
But if there's a chance
I can get through to him...

11:37.279 --> 11:41.075
There's no getting through to a lunatic,
Danny, believe me.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.077
He's not a lunatic, Ward.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.163
He just thinks he's guided by virtue.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.000
Terrific. What if he doesn't wanna talk?

11:51.585 --> 11:53.587
[Danny] Then we get Walker
to help bag and tag him.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.965
She bagged and tagged you.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.967
I was doing a job. It's over.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.552
This is a new job.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.723
I spent a long time learning
how to grab the Iron Fist.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.307
It worked.

12:08.769 --> 12:12.356
If Rand were to pay your fee,
how much we talking?

12:12.940 --> 12:14.191
Half a million dollars.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.152
[laughing]

12:20.656 --> 12:25.286
Danny, I'm not your keeper,
and this is way out of my league.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.998
Don't you think Colleen and Misty
are gonna go insane

12:29.081 --> 12:31.000
when they find out
that you left them out of this?

12:31.959 --> 12:33.169
I've got this.

12:34.378 --> 12:37.590
I bring Davos in,
they find out about the ceremony,

12:37.673 --> 12:38.758
it's a win-win.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.887
So much for finding your center.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.307
Look, just trust me on this, okay?

12:50.478 --> 12:53.647
[exhales] My sister knew that I was in NA.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.441
Did that information come from you? Well, you can ask her yourself.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.319
Oh, I plan on it.

12:58.861 --> 13:04.200
But for $500,000, I expect you
to confirm should she deny.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.453
I did a dossier on you, yes.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.246
[chuckles softly]

13:11.665 --> 13:14.460
[exhales] Ward Meachum.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.505
At the gym, like clockwork, in the a.m.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.925
Eight hours of e-mails,
meetings and phone calls at Rand,

13:21.008 --> 13:23.385
hop, skip to NA to jump your sponsor,

13:23.469 --> 13:26.597
and then home for an hour
of cable news before nighty night.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.808
Ouch.

13:30.392 --> 13:34.814
The lives of quiet desperation
are always the most desperate.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.490
Thank you.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.035
[chewing]

13:49.620 --> 13:52.790
What the hell is this? I said habanero.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.959
This is, like, teriyaki?

13:55.042 --> 13:57.711
Next time, pick a gas station
with a better selection.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.925
Look, I'm very, very serious
about my snacks.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.009
Okay.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.763
With this job,
you gotta keep your energy level high.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.766
People are always talking about cops
and their donuts.

14:11.392 --> 14:15.855
Cookies, chocolate, gum, you name it.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.731
But that sugar high...

14:19.066 --> 14:20.985
will send you crashing.

14:21.610 --> 14:25.489
You need something that will,
you know, give you the long burn.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.577
I heard a podcast once that said

14:29.660 --> 14:34.915
the most banal thing was to listen
to someone describe their dreams.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.044
You know what? I think they were wrong.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.421
[chuckles]

14:41.630 --> 14:42.756
Can I ask you a question?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.801
Why ask permission
when you're just gonna do it anyway?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.429
You said that you
were done with this life.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.973
You put your sword up on the wall...

14:51.807 --> 14:54.852
But you came with me to grab Joy.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.438
And this... this was your idea.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.523
[sighs] Someone's gotta do it.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.358
Yeah...

15:01.442 --> 15:04.069
but if we're thinking big picture,

15:05.195 --> 15:07.656
where do you see yourself in five years?

15:08.407 --> 15:11.410
-[chuckles]
-I'm serious. You volunteer at Bayard. That's cool.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.958
But you used to own a karate school.
Now you don't.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.502
What do you want to do with your life?

15:21.503 --> 15:22.546
[exhales]

15:24.131 --> 15:27.009
-Okay. You wanna play this game?
-Yeah.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.595
-Let me ask you a question.
-Okay.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.598
What are you gonna do
with this promotion-to-captain thing?

15:32.681 --> 15:34.308
Are you gonna be Captain Misty?

15:34.391 --> 15:36.518
-No.
-Am I gonna have to call you that now?

15:36.602 --> 15:37.978
No, don't turn it around.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.939
I'm serious.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.441
I already said that you would make
an excellent police.

15:42.524 --> 15:43.859
You got great instincts.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.196
-I killed Bakuto.
-He was trying to murder us.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.366
No, it's not about the decision
being right or not.

15:50.449 --> 15:56.288
What I mean is... I trusted him,
and I could not have been more wrong.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.832
If I'm that bad a judge of character,

15:58.916 --> 16:03.212
how in the world am I qualified to be
out here doing what you do every day?

16:03.295 --> 16:08.384
I have met a lot of good people
who went bad.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.471
And I've known some bad people
who went good.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.639
People change.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.850
Doesn't mean that
you misread them the first time.

16:17.893 --> 16:21.146
-Maybe.
-Not maybe. Yes.

16:21.689 --> 16:26.944
Besides, when it comes
to a gun and a shield,

16:27.569 --> 16:30.531
I want the person next to me
who questions their judgment.

16:31.448 --> 16:35.119
It's the ones who always think
they're right that scare me.

16:39.748 --> 16:40.749
Thank you.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.169
You want to thank me?

16:44.753 --> 16:48.132
Next time I say habanero, get me habanero.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.738
This is it.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.949
This garage is a criminal enterprise?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.242
[Chen] A chop shop.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.578
Hatchet-affiliated.

17:18.245 --> 17:21.040
They steal cars, take them apart,
sell them for parts.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.458
They also run Oxys.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.169
OxyContin.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.756
You have heard of the opioid epidemic?

17:28.839 --> 17:30.466
I don't care for the details.

17:30.966 --> 17:34.136
I know that they contribute
to the putrefaction of this city.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.638
Yeah. Putrefaction.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.605
[chuckles] Check.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.576
[groaning and shouting]

17:59.536 --> 18:01.246
[music playing on radio]

18:06.919 --> 18:09.296
-[grunting]
-[glass shattering]

18:40.828 --> 18:42.037
[exhales]

18:44.206 --> 18:45.374
[sighs heavily]

18:46.125 --> 18:49.044
-I was really hoping you were gone.
-I'm sure you were.

18:55.425 --> 18:58.554
It's funny, I always thought
I was the asshole in this family,

18:58.637 --> 19:00.681
but it turns out it was you all along.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.975
Well, trust me. You're still the asshole.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.230
It's like they've never heard of rosé.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.190
I know that you and I
have had our differences.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.778
So I can understand
why you would want to hurt me,

19:14.862 --> 19:17.739
but what I don't understand
is how could you do this to Danny?

19:18.782 --> 19:21.410
Need I remind you
that you tried to have him killed?

19:21.493 --> 19:22.619
On two separate occasions.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.621
When I thought he was an impostor

19:24.705 --> 19:27.374
who was gonna burn down
everything we built. I was wrong.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.126
No, only about the impostor part.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.462
Truth is, he did light it all up.

19:33.130 --> 19:37.092
Then he exposed your bullshit,
Dad's lies, the Hand...

19:37.593 --> 19:39.761
got me shot, Dad killed.

19:39.845 --> 19:43.765
Danny didn't do any of that purposefully
or with malice.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.476
And that makes it okay?

19:47.144 --> 19:49.479
How can he come into my life,
level it to the ground,

19:49.563 --> 19:51.231
and then walk away believing he's a hero?

19:51.315 --> 19:55.027
You want to blame someone?
Blame the Hand. Blame Dad. Blame me.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.612
Oh, I do blame you, Ward.

19:57.404 --> 20:01.700
But I don't need to trip you up. You'll
fall and burn just fine on your own.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.160
[softly] Yeah...

20:11.001 --> 20:13.170
I know that you suffered.

20:13.253 --> 20:17.007
I'm sorry that you had to lose Dad
all over again.

20:17.090 --> 20:20.344
I am sorry that you got shot.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.763
I thank God I got shot.

20:22.846 --> 20:28.185
Ward, I was living in a cave,
watching shadows on the wall.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.481
My entire life has been a lie
because of you.

20:32.564 --> 20:36.026
So I'm glad Danny came back. I am.

20:36.109 --> 20:40.530
He opened my eyes to who he is,
to who you have always been,

20:40.614 --> 20:44.117
but most importantly, to who I need to be.

20:44.701 --> 20:45.994
Now, who is that?

20:46.662 --> 20:50.207
Somebody who allies herself
with a murdering psychopath?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.125
No, that's your thing.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.545
If you say you were protecting me
from Dad, I swear--

20:55.629 --> 20:58.048
I was protecting you!

20:58.131 --> 21:02.177
I believe it for the first six months.
How about the next 12 years?

21:02.261 --> 21:05.013
The way that you remember Harold
is not who he was.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.808
He would fly into these rages.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.686
And the things he would say to me,
the things that he would do to me--

21:10.769 --> 21:13.647
He was a little tough on his protégé?
Builds character, right?

21:13.730 --> 21:17.651
I was his punching bag.
And not metaphorically.

21:19.778 --> 21:23.073
That time that I... I broke my arm skiing?

21:23.615 --> 21:28.578
The time that I got into that car accident
and I was all covered with bruises?

21:31.498 --> 21:34.543
[shakily] You have no idea
what I spared you from.

21:34.626 --> 21:38.505
There were so many times
that I wanted to tell you. I would literally pack a bag,
buy plane tickets,

21:43.093 --> 21:46.138
get into a car, drive to your place,

21:46.221 --> 21:51.143
thinking, "How am I gonna tell you
that we need to run away and start over?"

21:57.691 --> 21:59.067
But you didn't do it.

22:00.068 --> 22:01.570
And now we're here.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.326
[sighs]

22:12.789 --> 22:14.958
When we get to Davos,
you need to stay back.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.210
He knows you're with me,
he won't be complacent.

22:17.294 --> 22:20.881
I think it would be a mistake
to leave you with him.

22:21.548 --> 22:25.302
Well, I don't care what you think.
Just do your job, okay?

22:25.385 --> 22:27.262
Taking him out is only a contingency.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.767
You need to keep your distance.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.268
You wanna talk to him.

22:33.935 --> 22:36.396
Got... it.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.608
Should he prove unreceptive,
I suggest you clear the deck.

22:39.691 --> 22:40.942
Because, until we have the Fist,

22:41.026 --> 22:43.362
Davos is holding
the biggest gun in the room.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.906
You get off on the mind games?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.825
Making nice. Coming into my home.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.619
Meeting my girlfriend.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.454
It was not a mind game.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.541
You were playing me from the start.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.378
I was not playing you.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.422
If I do my job right,
you never see my face.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.258
It was an accident. I was following you
and must have hit a trigger.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.551
A trigger?

23:06.635 --> 23:09.346
An environmental cue
that sparks an emotional response,

23:09.429 --> 23:11.348
bringing an alter to the fore.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.850
Mine goes by Mary.

23:14.726 --> 23:18.647
Mary, Mary, sad and contrary.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.983
And Mary, she...
she has no memory of what you do? The first "D" in DID
stands for "dissociative."

23:25.404 --> 23:27.864
So that means
another part of me is driving.

23:29.449 --> 23:32.285
How long does it last? The switch.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.830
Hours, days. Sometimes longer.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.623
Until she gets stressed.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.834
Elevated heart rate, adrenaline.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.086
Brings me back to myself.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.631
What about when it goes the other way?

23:44.714 --> 23:47.717
The sound of running water,
bright strobing lights,

23:47.801 --> 23:49.177
prolonged exposure to cold.

23:49.261 --> 23:53.390
At that point, it's no longer me,
it's Mary.

23:54.224 --> 23:57.185
Those things are everywhere.
Must be tough.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.939
It is a lot.

24:01.022 --> 24:02.941
There's this house in Arizona.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.446
I plan to move there and spend
the rest of my days watching birds fly.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.615
That's what the money is for, right?

24:12.242 --> 24:13.368
Let's go.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.295
[Colleen sighs] Business must be booming.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.589
No, this is the last place
in the five boroughs

24:25.672 --> 24:27.174
where the rent is still cheap.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.758
[Colleen] Or Joy was lying.

24:29.176 --> 24:32.304
She better not have been.
It's too damn cold to be out here.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.556
-You hear that?
-[music playing in distance]

24:35.390 --> 24:36.391
Yeah.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.566
[upbeat music playing]

25:05.378 --> 25:06.379
Later.

25:16.806 --> 25:17.724
[Misty] Hey!

25:20.185 --> 25:22.062
-[music stops]
-Evening.

25:25.148 --> 25:29.611
Uh, my friend and I,
we wanna get some work done.

25:30.737 --> 25:31.947
Yeah. [clears throat]

25:32.030 --> 25:33.740
Well, we're all booked up.

25:33.823 --> 25:35.283
-You sure?
-[chuckles]

25:35.367 --> 25:39.329
It's kinda dead in here.
You can't just squeeze us in?

25:39.412 --> 25:42.666
You think I'm an idiot?
What do you want?

25:43.291 --> 25:47.879
Tattoos. We really...
We really are interested in tattoos.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.048
You got no ink. Neither of you.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.677
Uh... Everyone's gotta
start somewhere. Right?

25:54.261 --> 25:58.014
Why don't you try St. Marks Place?
This is not a first-piece kind of shop.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.309
-Okay?
-Okay.

26:03.019 --> 26:07.399
We're interested in a piece that you did.
A snake.

26:08.191 --> 26:10.277
A guy named Davos, last night.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.028
Doesn't ring a bell.

26:12.946 --> 26:13.947
No?

26:16.283 --> 26:20.704
Either of you remember working
a Tebori tattoo on a friend of mine?

26:21.246 --> 26:22.998
There would've been
another guy in the room,

26:23.081 --> 26:26.751
doped up, bleeding out, half dead.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.004
She have a warrant?

26:29.087 --> 26:33.758
Hey, I'm right here.
And I don't need one to ask questions.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.760
Well, we're not talking to any police.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.262
You want to talk to me?

26:37.345 --> 26:39.472
'Cause I live with the guy
that you bled out.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.349
I told you it was a bad idea.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.475
Shut up.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.893
We don't owe him a thing.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.478
No, you don't.

26:45.562 --> 26:49.983
Listen, I get it. I'm sure you all
get asked to do all kinds of freaky shit.

26:50.525 --> 26:53.737
Just this time, you inked the wrong dude.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.573
If you have something to add,
now's the time.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.199
Hey, she don't like you.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.744
Okay, well, the feeling's mutual.

27:00.827 --> 27:01.953
Here's the deal.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.873
On top of assault charges and kidnapping,

27:04.956 --> 27:08.209
Davos is wanted for a whole slew
of dead Triad.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.295
And you three are accessories.

27:10.378 --> 27:11.713
That's bullshit.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.340
We don't want to book you.

27:13.423 --> 27:16.509
But we do need to know
exactly what you did to our friend.

27:16.593 --> 27:17.427
Misty.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.512
[grunting]

27:23.558 --> 27:25.435
-God damn it!
-Get the needles!

27:28.855 --> 27:29.814
-Go!
-[grunts]

28:16.903 --> 28:18.113
[engine revving]

28:20.156 --> 28:21.616
[grunts]

28:32.711 --> 28:33.878
[straining]

29:29.726 --> 29:30.852
[exhales]

29:31.561 --> 29:32.437
[groaning]

29:37.567 --> 29:40.445
Now, let's try this again.

29:40.528 --> 29:41.488
[exhales]

29:44.824 --> 29:46.785
[Walker] Doesn't look like anyone's home.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.077
[Danny] Then we wait.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.916
-How long did you stay at the ceremony?
-[Walker] Not long.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.460
My job was to deliver you.

29:56.169 --> 30:00.423
The Crane Sisters bled you...
and inked him.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.701
[Danny] This is where I was bound.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.912
At the end, he stood up...

30:32.247 --> 30:33.540
came over to me.

30:34.874 --> 30:37.877
He barely touched me,
but I could feel this heat.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.341
The heart of the dragon
was being pulled out of me.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.303
The pain was unbearable.

30:51.057 --> 30:53.893
-Give me the syringe, Walker.
-[Walker] What do you mean?

30:54.853 --> 30:58.189
I'll be standing right next to him.
I can dose him myself. Give it to me.

30:59.482 --> 31:00.400
[Walker] Uh...

31:01.025 --> 31:02.527
That's not the plan.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.862
I don't trust your plan.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.615
Why would you put yourself
in harm's way if you didn't have to?

31:08.533 --> 31:12.871
You don't know me...
so you're being paranoid.

31:12.954 --> 31:15.123
Yeah. I am.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.334
Give me the syringe.

31:21.421 --> 31:24.591
When we stopped by your apartment
and you opened up about DID...

31:25.884 --> 31:27.427
as much as I appreciate it...

31:29.429 --> 31:31.431
it was tactical, wasn't it?

31:32.557 --> 31:33.850
Put me at ease.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.606
-What's your plan, Walker?
-[chuckles]

31:48.197 --> 31:50.575
[gasps] Madness.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.623
The Wen brothers,

31:56.706 --> 32:00.209
our man watching Pell Street businesses,
Sammy Lee and his cousin...

32:00.793 --> 32:01.878
all dead.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.006
And that's just on our side.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.508
Find me who did this!

32:08.092 --> 32:09.969
As my husband used to say,

32:12.055 --> 32:14.432
"Blood for blood."

32:25.401 --> 32:27.987
You have to know
I never wanted to hurt you.

32:29.072 --> 32:31.032
What do intentions matter in this?

32:32.116 --> 32:33.117
You did.

32:40.583 --> 32:45.838
The whole NA thing was supposed to be
a way to understand how to fix this.

32:46.589 --> 32:50.176
Find a way to talk to you
and show you that I want to change.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.013
[exhales]

33:00.561 --> 33:01.562
Joy...

33:03.189 --> 33:05.566
I'm your only family in the whole world.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.443
Do you really want me gone?

33:14.701 --> 33:17.036
You know,
you weren't the only one with a plan.

33:18.997 --> 33:23.918
I was gonna get out.
Start my own business. [sighs]

33:24.460 --> 33:26.462
See what my life could look like.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.340
My life.

33:30.883 --> 33:35.805
'Cause only then could I even consider
coming back and seeing where we stood.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.224
Two people, fully independent,

33:39.308 --> 33:41.978
trying and seeing
what fences we could mend.

33:42.061 --> 33:43.396
I want that.

33:43.479 --> 33:46.858
Yeah. I know you want that, Ward.
You've made your wants perfectly clear.

33:46.941 --> 33:50.028
What I'm saying is that
maybe I could someday want that, too.

33:50.111 --> 33:53.698
But it has to be on my time.
Not when you're ready, when I am ready.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.743
I understand that. But I wanna--

33:56.826 --> 33:59.162
Stop! Do you hear yourself?

34:00.246 --> 34:01.539
"I want!"

34:01.622 --> 34:05.293
Every time you say "I want," it reminds me
that you spent our entire lives

34:05.376 --> 34:08.629
putting your wants and your needs
before even thinking about mine.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.470
[softly] Oh, God.

34:16.471 --> 34:20.892
You know, you asked me
how I could do what I did to Danny.

34:21.809 --> 34:22.977
The truth?

34:25.897 --> 34:31.277
I did it to him because...
I couldn't bear to do it to you.

34:33.988 --> 34:35.531
And I couldn't do it to Dad.

34:37.408 --> 34:40.036
That is so screwed up and sad.

34:53.424 --> 34:54.842
Dad's dead.

34:56.719 --> 35:00.932
And... somehow
he's still tearing us apart.

35:03.893 --> 35:08.940
If he does that, Joy,
then, in the end, he wins.

35:11.317 --> 35:14.320
Who cares if he wins or loses?
He's ashes in a jar.

35:21.702 --> 35:24.163
Goodbye, Ward. For good.

35:24.872 --> 35:27.208
[Colleen] Okay, let me get this straight.

35:27.834 --> 35:30.753
The skin that Davos cut from the corpse...

35:32.088 --> 35:34.257
-you burned it?
-Mmm-hmm.

35:34.841 --> 35:38.302
The ash, it, uh, mixes with the blood
to create the ink.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.305
I'm sorry, but what the hell
is wrong with you all?

35:41.389 --> 35:42.765
It was a job.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.059
You could have said no.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.479
Why that skin?
And why'd he have to ship it from China?

35:48.563 --> 35:51.482
It had some scarification on it.
Some kind of burn.

35:51.566 --> 35:55.278
It was black as night.
It was the shape of a bird, or a...

35:55.778 --> 35:56.821
A dragon.

35:58.364 --> 36:02.743
Okay, and the tattoo you gave Davos,
the snake thing?

36:02.827 --> 36:04.453
He called it a serpent.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.957
He insisted we use
our steel Tebori needles.

36:09.917 --> 36:13.421
And what is the significance of these?

36:14.255 --> 36:16.465
All we know about the ritual
is what he told us to do.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.010
Wait. "Ritual." Is that his word or yours?

36:19.594 --> 36:21.220
Take a wild guess.

36:21.304 --> 36:22.430
You know what?

36:22.513 --> 36:25.683
[chuckles] Okay, if we can get
everything back together...

36:25.766 --> 36:28.769
the skin, the needles, the blood...

36:29.312 --> 36:31.689
you think you can do
this ritual thing in reverse?

36:36.277 --> 36:40.364
Keep in mind that the alternative
is a long stay in a small cell.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.200
Oh, and that's after I'm done with you.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.703
We can ink. You need the bowl.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.080
She speaks.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.459
Yeah, you'd need that.
And some more specifics.

36:51.542 --> 36:55.213
Davos was very precise
about the measurements and the timing,

36:55.296 --> 36:57.506
but you can ask him about that yourself.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.760
Do you think if we could ask him,
we would be talking to you three?

37:00.843 --> 37:02.428
We'll work it out. Okay?

37:02.511 --> 37:06.057
But when the time comes,
can you do your part?

37:09.310 --> 37:11.896
Looks like you've come
to the right place after all.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.788
[Chen] Hell of a place you got here.

37:29.455 --> 37:33.751
It's a little, you know,
a work in progress, but, uh...

37:35.753 --> 37:37.880
You know,
I could take you to a nice hotel.

37:37.964 --> 37:42.551
Some place with electrical lighting,
indoor plumbing. Housekeeping.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.345
This place suits me fine.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.933
Believe it or not,
it actually reminds me of home.

37:49.850 --> 37:50.768
And where is that?

37:52.144 --> 37:53.980
A name you're not worthy of hearing.

37:55.314 --> 37:56.732
Okay, then.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.534
[Chen] Want me to meet you
back here tomorrow?

38:06.867 --> 38:10.079
[Davos] Today was only the first of many,
and there is much to be done.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.503
[sighs]

38:19.171 --> 38:20.506
Freakin' unbelievable.

38:22.216 --> 38:23.092
[knocking]

38:27.054 --> 38:30.891
At the chop shop this evening,
did you notice those youths on bicycles?

38:30.975 --> 38:32.518
They were following after us.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.478
Seeing what they can lift.

38:35.104 --> 38:39.066
Yeah, those kids,
they're just vultures. Scavengers.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.652
They live in a squat
near the Manhattan Bridge.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.905
They live together?
Don't they have families?

38:45.990 --> 38:47.116
No idea.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.203
You want me to put them on the list?

38:52.288 --> 38:54.832
No. Not yet.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.221
What are you really doing here, Walker?

39:09.972 --> 39:12.391
We have a problem.
I'm here to take care of it.

39:13.225 --> 39:14.560
You're gonna kill him.

39:16.771 --> 39:20.191
-That's not part of the deal.
-You're in no condition to stop me.

39:20.274 --> 39:23.194
Let me talk to him. Try and reach him.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.987
Your friend Ward was right.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.990
He won't listen. He's too far gone.

39:28.532 --> 39:31.160
I can't be tied to this,
and neither can Joy.

39:31.243 --> 39:33.037
Joy put you up to this?

39:34.872 --> 39:37.958
That cabin? In Arizona?

39:39.835 --> 39:41.128
I can make it happen.

39:42.463 --> 39:47.093
You'll be comfortable. Safe.
For as long as you want or need.

39:47.676 --> 39:49.345
You just gotta stick to the plan.

39:49.929 --> 39:50.930
Fine.

39:54.141 --> 39:55.643
I won't hurt him.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.362
Brother.

40:09.698 --> 40:11.367
I didn't expect to see you here.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.077
How are you?

40:19.875 --> 40:21.710
What are you doing, Davos?

40:21.794 --> 40:24.046
The work of an Iron Fist, Danny.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.589
Is that what you call it?

40:27.466 --> 40:29.135
You've got blood on your face.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.349
You've been killing people.

40:36.517 --> 40:40.187
When a feral dog is put down,
do you call it murder?

40:40.813 --> 40:45.317
When a virus is flushed from the body,
is that murder?

40:46.902 --> 40:48.446
Call it justice.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.031
You should be thanking me.

40:52.032 --> 40:55.077
I freed you from a responsibility
that had become a burden.

40:56.036 --> 40:59.165
You spit in the face
of a thousand-year tradition.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.543
You didn't earn it.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.045
You stole it.

41:05.129 --> 41:08.007
You dare to speak of tradition
after you abandoned ours?

41:11.969 --> 41:13.220
You see, Danny...

41:14.430 --> 41:19.143
you feel that you can just walk through
this world as if it belongs to you.

41:21.979 --> 41:27.234
You value nothing, because your privilege
has afforded you everything.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.822
You've never had a heritage of your own.

41:33.616 --> 41:36.368
A culture you must honor and protect.

41:36.952 --> 41:39.330
Stop validating your actions, Davos.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.000
This violence...

41:44.543 --> 41:46.086
it needs to stop right now.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.380
-I've chosen my path.
-You've lost your way.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.176
I know what you think you're doing.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.261
But the police won't.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.138
No one will.

41:57.431 --> 42:00.476
And if you resist, they will come
after you and they will kill you.

42:01.435 --> 42:04.522
If you come with me now,
you can hand yourself in.

42:04.605 --> 42:05.940
[chuckles]

42:07.942 --> 42:09.276
Oh, I know the risks.

42:10.694 --> 42:12.821
This is what commitment looks like, Danny.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.325
That night at the pier,
you told me you're protecting this city,

42:16.408 --> 42:19.161
but you've never had the strength
of character to walk a hard line.

42:19.245 --> 42:22.331
This war between the Triads,
I ended it in a single day.

42:22.414 --> 42:26.919
No, you didn't. You just became
another faction in the conflict.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.421
You disgrace everything
Lei Kung ever taught us.

42:29.505 --> 42:31.840
My father misled us all, Danny.
Sold us all lies.

42:31.924 --> 42:34.009
His heart would break
if he could hear you now.

42:34.093 --> 42:37.555
If he was here now... I'd crush his heart.

42:39.431 --> 42:42.184
He sent you down a path
you never should have walked.

42:43.852 --> 42:45.646
Put us in opposition.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.773
-I know you're angry.
-No, I'm not angry.

42:47.856 --> 42:48.941
Not anymore.

42:50.359 --> 42:51.902
I want you with me, brother.

42:54.029 --> 42:57.700
Here to learn at my feet and, one day,
perhaps fight beside me.

42:59.243 --> 43:03.789
I'm a patient man,
and change doesn't happen overnight.

43:04.373 --> 43:07.668
It starts with a person. Do you remember?

43:08.669 --> 43:12.047
A paragon of virtue
with a righteous cause.

43:13.757 --> 43:15.259
Can you hear yourself?

43:16.594 --> 43:19.555
"A righteous cause"?
"A paragon of virtue"?

43:22.057 --> 43:24.184
You can't really see yourself that way.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.563
It's how you will see me.

43:28.939 --> 43:31.150
As the scales fall from your eyes.

43:40.909 --> 43:42.119
[grunting]

43:45.247 --> 43:47.249
[Walker and Davos shouting]

43:50.919 --> 43:52.463
[panting]

43:59.136 --> 44:00.346
[grunts]

44:05.476 --> 44:07.144
You crossed the line, Danny.

44:14.151 --> 44:16.320
[panting]

44:24.370 --> 44:25.788
[screaming]

44:35.464 --> 44:37.466
[Danny groaning]

44:40.761 --> 44:43.889
-I got you.
-[Danny] My leg, it's broken.

44:44.556 --> 44:48.143
You need to call Colleen. Call Misty.
We need to get Davos out of here.

44:48.894 --> 44:50.396
[both shouting and grunting]

45:02.074 --> 45:03.033
[Danny yells]

45:03.117 --> 45:05.703
Stay with me.
Hey, stay with me. All right?

45:07.621 --> 45:09.623
Okay. Stay with me.

45:10.290 --> 45:11.583
Stay with me.

45:14.378 --> 45:15.838
All right. All right.

45:17.631 --> 45:18.465
All right.

45:19.007 --> 45:22.177
Um. [clears throat]
I need an ambulance at 42 Baxter.

45:22.261 --> 45:26.265
Whole tattoo thing, it's more of a novelty
that I don't have one at this stage.

45:26.807 --> 45:30.144
Do it. I can totally see you
pulling off some ink.

45:30.227 --> 45:32.396
-Hell no.
-Hell yeah!

45:32.479 --> 45:34.773
I see a heart with Danny's name on it.

45:35.357 --> 45:37.317
-Stop.
-[Misty] Little petunia...

45:40.487 --> 45:41.321
[Colleen] Shit.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.706
[sighs] Danny.

45:50.789 --> 45:52.166
Come on. Keep talking.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.960
Walker, we had a deal.

45:55.043 --> 45:56.295
We have a deal.

45:56.378 --> 45:58.881
-[sirens approaching]
-[thunder rumbling]

46:01.091 --> 46:02.384
We have a deal.

46:02.468 --> 46:04.303
[siren wailing]

46:19.526 --> 46:20.611
Walker? Walker?

46:46.970 --> 46:48.305
Ma'am, are you injured?

46:49.473 --> 46:50.390
Oh.

46:52.559 --> 46:57.064
Oh, it's nothing. I must have fallen.
I was just out walking in the rain.

46:59.191 --> 47:00.192
Danny?

47:01.860 --> 47:02.736
Mary?

47:02.820 --> 47:04.655
Wait, was there an accident? Mary, you need to bring Walker back.

47:08.826 --> 47:09.827
Walker?

47:10.369 --> 47:12.079
Mary, how do I get through to Walker?

47:12.704 --> 47:15.999
I can't be here. I should go.

47:16.083 --> 47:19.002
Mary, you need to call Colleen
and tell her we have Davos.

47:19.711 --> 47:20.712
Who's Davos?

47:21.880 --> 47:25.217
If Walker wants her money,
if she wants that cabin in the woods,

47:25.300 --> 47:27.135
then she has to finish her job.

47:27.219 --> 47:28.303
You hearing me?

47:28.387 --> 47:30.305
[medic 1] Sir, I need you to try
to calm down.

47:31.181 --> 47:34.226
Cabin? She wants to run away.

47:34.309 --> 47:36.103
Mary, you need to get Davos!

47:36.186 --> 47:37.563
She can't do that.

47:38.272 --> 47:39.398
Mary, please!

47:39.481 --> 47:41.608
She can't do that. She can't...

47:44.194 --> 47:46.613
I hope you know
I didn't mean to hurt you, Danny.

47:47.239 --> 47:48.866
I did not know she was gonna hurt you.

47:51.076 --> 47:53.036
But I can't let her take me to a cabin.

47:54.121 --> 47:56.039
I deserve a chance to be happy.

47:58.041 --> 47:59.209
Mary!

47:59.793 --> 48:02.504
-Are you riding with us to the hospital?
-Mary, please come back!

48:02.588 --> 48:05.674
Mary! Mary, you have to get Davos!

48:07.259 --> 48:09.261
Please, Mary! Please!

48:16.935 --> 48:18.186
What did you do?

48:19.521 --> 48:20.814
[Danny] Mary, please!

48:21.648 --> 48:23.901
Mary! Mary, please!

48:23.984 --> 48:25.944
Come back! Mary!
