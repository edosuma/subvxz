00:03.880 --> 00:06.236
I feel like the world's broken.

00:07.560 --> 00:08.789
I never used to think that.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.278
I never really thought about it, I suppose.

00:14.920 --> 00:18.596
These days, I just feel
a total absence of joy in my life.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.759
I look at my children, or...

00:23.720 --> 00:27.316
just random people walking down the street

00:27.360 --> 00:28.555
and I want to shake them.

00:29.480 --> 00:33.633
I mean... don't they realise it's over?

00:42.920 --> 00:45.037
Do you think the world was fixed before?

00:45.280 --> 00:46.280
No, of course not.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.796
It takes something like this
to make you realise

00:49.520 --> 00:50.670
how everything is ruined.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.631
Are you referring to the relationship
with your wife?

00:57.960 --> 00:58.960
What I did...

01:02.400 --> 01:04.391
What they asked me to do...

01:09.160 --> 01:10.389
it changed everything.

01:11.880 --> 01:14.270
I'm wondering,
when you say the world is broken

01:14.320 --> 01:15.320
maybe...

01:16.120 --> 01:20.160
you're referring to something
that is broken inside of you?

01:23.120 --> 01:25.401
It's like you haven't listened
to a word I've been saying.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.749
What I did...

01:32.200 --> 01:33.350
it can't be undone.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.117
And as a direct consequence

01:41.640 --> 01:43.040
the world has changed.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.598
Everything's changed, because of what I did.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.040
That's time.

01:54.840 --> 01:55.840
Good.

<i>Team 21 to Team 11, do you read me? Over.</i>

05:31.400 --> 05:33.676
Leave it. I don't wanna talk to them.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.670
I should probably just, you know,
acknowledge.

05:39.560 --> 05:40.676
We read you, 21.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.040
I know that Ruby's pissed off

05:42.200 --> 05:44.192
but can you please ask her
to at least talk to us?

05:44.280 --> 05:46.158
Tell her to go fuck herself.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.159
That's a... a negative.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.760
<i>Definitely a negative.</i>

05:51.040 --> 05:52.040
Come on, Ruby.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.232
Look, we're only three places behind you.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.736
<i>If you get them to pull over,
we can pick you up in five minutes.</i>

05:56.760 --> 05:58.000
Can you stop them from talking?

05:58.320 --> 05:59.515
Yeah. Sure.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.358
Thanks.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.360
So, Ruby...

06:14.000 --> 06:15.696
Why did you decide
to take part in the race?

06:15.720 --> 06:16.720
Let's not do this.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.360
Do what?

06:19.680 --> 06:22.798
You ask me lots of questions
and pretend to be interested in what I say

06:22.840 --> 06:24.911
and then I pretend to be interested in you

06:25.120 --> 06:27.032
then we bond and learn from each other

06:27.160 --> 06:29.277
I mean, it's just such total bullshit.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.320
I'm sorry, but it is.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.360
Excuse me.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.393
We've just lost both our parents.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.437
You could at least pretend to give a shit.

06:43.640 --> 06:44.640
I'm sorry.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.993
Your mum seemed like a really good woman.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.159
Wherever she is, I hope she's at peace.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.120
Oh, my God, that's...

07:17.440 --> 07:18.440
Mum!

07:19.240 --> 07:20.240
She's alive!

07:21.320 --> 07:22.549
What's she doing on the roof?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.151
Team 11 to Team, er... Awesome.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.954
<i>Thanks for picking up our mum.</i>

07:29.040 --> 07:30.816
<i>If you can just pull over
at the side of the road</i>

07:30.840 --> 07:31.956
that'd be awesome!

07:32.360 --> 07:34.875
<i>Sorry, old bean,
I don't think that's a very good idea.</i>

07:35.600 --> 07:38.274
<i>Probably gonna be hard for you to hear,
so you better sit down.</i>

07:39.560 --> 07:41.438
Fact of the matter is...

07:42.600 --> 07:43.716
your mum's had it.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.556
<i>She's been bitten, see.</i>

07:46.080 --> 07:48.072
<i>Sure she was a very nice person.</i>

07:48.400 --> 07:49.400
She seemed like it.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.195
Think of the good times.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.759
Can we just talk to her, please?

07:55.800 --> 07:57.029
They wanna talk to her.
- Why?

07:57.080 --> 07:58.256
They wanna talk to her befo...
- No, no.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.296
They wanna talk to her before she,
well, y'know, changes.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.596
I'm...
- Don't worry. I got this.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.600
Hiya.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.536
Your little kids wanna speak to you,
by the way.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.560
<i>We love you, Mum.</i>

08:13.120 --> 08:14.440
You have to keep going.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.160
<i>I was bitten.</i>

08:16.280 --> 08:17.919
<i>I'm sorry I can't come with you, but...</i>

08:17.960 --> 08:20.953
you're gonna win this race
and you're gonna make me

08:21.040 --> 08:22.235
and your dad proud.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.600
<i>And when you get to that island,
you're gonna make something of yourself.</i>

08:25.680 --> 08:27.160
<i>Meg - you'll be OK.</i>

08:27.240 --> 08:29.152
<i>Zane's a good man. He loves you.</i>

08:29.440 --> 08:30.874
<i>Start a family together</i>

08:31.040 --> 08:32.599
<i>but make sure you get a career first.</i>

08:33.080 --> 08:34.080
And Roman...

08:34.760 --> 08:36.193
it doesn't matter if you're gay.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.311
<i>It doesn't make me love you any less.</i>

08:39.200 --> 08:41.590
Wait a minute, Mum, I'm not gay.
- We love you too, Mum.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.999
<i>You have to keep going.</i>

08:44.280 --> 08:45.509
<i>And if you get scared</i>

08:46.040 --> 08:47.040
just remember.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.635
I'm right here with you.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.158
You just have to close your eyes
and remember all the good times

08:52.200 --> 08:53.200
that we had together.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.231
<i>Cos they were the happiest days of my life.</i>

08:56.960 --> 08:59.555
That's the most beautifulest thing
I ever heard in my life.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.234
Such a nice lady, man.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.034
Overtake them, Zane.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.554
Don't look back, Roman.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
How's she doing?

09:38.560 --> 09:40.756
I dunno how to describe it.
Terrible, obviously, but...

09:41.360 --> 09:42.396
kind of amazing too.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.076
I guess that's part and parcel with the whole
turning-into-a-monster thing, huh?

09:47.280 --> 09:49.033
Erm... well, I don't know.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.639
Whaddaya mean?

09:50.680 --> 09:52.256
She's hulking out
like a motherfucker up there.

09:52.280 --> 09:55.318
Well, I'm just saying
there could be another reason, that's all.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.480
What did you give her?

09:59.080 --> 10:00.080
Nothing.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.590
Just gave her a drink...

10:02.080 --> 10:03.434
before putting her on the roof.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.160
Where's the acid?

10:07.640 --> 10:08.756
How much did you give her?

10:10.080 --> 10:11.196
Less than half.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.550
OK, all of it.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.760
And the mescaline...

10:18.280 --> 10:20.397
and maybe a smidgen of ether.

10:36.880 --> 10:37.916

D'you know why?

10:53.440 --> 10:55.159
Because you gave away all of our narcotics

10:55.200 --> 10:58.272
just so you can spike an innocent member
of the public, you animal.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.591
Sorry, Doc,
I just thought it'd be quite funny

11:01.280 --> 11:03.749
to see what happens
if you spike one of those things.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.513
And ease Jenny's pain, of course.

11:05.640 --> 11:06.640
Fair enough.

11:06.880 --> 11:07.916
Oh!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.275
Alright...
- I'm OK!

11:10.360 --> 11:11.237
I think I'm OK.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.159
Think it's fair to say
we may have overstated

11:14.200 --> 11:15.816
the transformative aspects of your condition.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.309
I dunno,
I took mescaline in Mexico City once.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.358
That was pretty transformative.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.517
Wait a minute. You spiked me?

11:23.600 --> 11:26.911
Yeah.
- Un-fucking-believable.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.376
Did you try any other psychotropics
while you was out there?

11:34.800 --> 11:36.360

Won't do that again.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.196
Someone take the wheel for me?
- Yeah, me, me, me!

11:42.240 --> 11:44.550
No. No. No. No. No, I got this.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.110
Well, now... welcome back, Jenny.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.640
What's wrong with you people?

11:48.680 --> 11:50.956
D'you think this is some kind of joke?
- Not at all.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.240
We couldn't be more serious.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.720
The middle pedal's the brake, right?

11:55.280 --> 12:00.150
OK... What I'm interested in is what made you
think you were becoming a monster

12:00.200 --> 12:02.237
in the first place.
- You spiked me.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.920
Oh, no, that happened long after
you bought a ticket to Mookland.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.719
Oh!

12:07.000 --> 12:09.356
Have a seat, Jenny.
- Yup. Middle one's the brake.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.720
Maybe you wanted
to be a monster to begin with.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.229
Maybe the real monster is inside of you.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.913
You're not ready to go back to...
she's not ready to go back to her family.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.856
We... No, we gotta get to the root
of this problem.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.678
You're trying to analyse me?
- Mmm...

12:22.240 --> 12:23.879
You're insane.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.394
Well, insanity's relative.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.120
Just depends what side
of the cage you're on.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.600
We can do this.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.110
Let's see if Daddy's plan's
any smarter than he was.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.272
You don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't abandon my children.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.716
Yet here you are...

13:19.280 --> 13:21.511
I thought I was gonna turn into one
of those things.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.150
But it was just a scratch.

13:23.480 --> 13:26.241
What's interesting is that you immediately
thought you were a monster.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.996
You clearly felt more comfortable
embracing death

13:29.040 --> 13:31.157
than continuing to struggle for survival

13:31.200 --> 13:32.960
and I think that's very interesting as well.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.800
I don't care if you think that's interesting.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.754
I want to get out of this madhouse
and protect my children.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.677
Doctor Jones...

13:38.720 --> 13:42.509
Are you sure you wanna protect your children?
- OK, you need to let me out, right now.

13:42.880 --> 13:43.880
I need to be with them.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.201
- Doctor Jones.
- Then why did you reject them?

13:46.360 --> 13:47.919
I didn't reject them.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.096
Why aren't you letting me talk...
- Oh, Doctor Jones!

13:50.120 --> 13:51.120
What is it?

13:56.080 --> 13:57.878
Just when we were starting
to make progress.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.520
What?

14:20.800 --> 14:21.800
You smell that?

14:23.600 --> 14:25.910
Something smells... fishy.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.616
Should I break out the breathing apparatus?

14:29.640 --> 14:31.711
No, no, no. We may need that later.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.597
Either bonfires out of control, or...

14:35.520 --> 14:38.558
may be there's some sort of
contestant-related skullduggery.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.279
And I'll bet dollars for donuts
I can guess which.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.000
We think it's a trap.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.711
Couple of vehicles went in there
a while back.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.959
Haven't heard from 'em since.

14:57.920 --> 14:58.920
It's like I said.

14:59.960 --> 15:00.837
Fishy.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.480
What's going on?

15:44.800 --> 15:46.951
Nothing to worry about.
- What about the smoke?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.870
We won't be able to see anything.
- Already thought of that.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.716
Are you sure that's gonna help there, buddy?

15:54.840 --> 15:56.354
Trust me. I drive better this way.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.034
You don't drive!
- Exactly.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.115
Where's the gear stick?

16:09.400 --> 16:10.914
I think I can hear someone else.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.560
No one's shooting at them.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.756
Congratulations, El Capitano.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.996
You see what happens
when you follow your instincts?

16:40.480 --> 16:42.995
Now, we need to start breaking down
those barriers.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.239
Uh, when we were talking about
embracing death...

16:46.560 --> 16:48.552
I'm wondering if we can explore

16:48.800 --> 16:51.713
that maybe a part of that is connected
to a fear of being alive.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.514
I don't want to explore anything.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.470
I want you to pull over right now.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.720
I'm detecting a little bit of hostility
right now.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.480
Graurgh!

17:02.040 --> 17:03.856
What's the first thing
that comes to your mind

17:03.880 --> 17:06.348
when you think about your mother?

17:06.560 --> 17:07.760
What's the second thing?

17:40.200 --> 17:41.200
You alright there, love?

17:46.120 --> 17:47.120
It's OK.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.120
My name's Lou.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.320
Lou Collins.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.597
My name's "Step The Fuck Away".

17:55.680 --> 17:57.480
Alright, there's no need for any of that,
I...

17:59.240 --> 18:02.278
Just looked like you were in a bit
of discomfort right now

18:02.320 --> 18:04.198
and I thought maybe you needed some help.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.080
Right.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.871
Looks like you can take care of yourself.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.040
Mind how you go.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.351
Maybe she decided she really likes Volvos.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.549
Either that or it's the dog.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.956
Yeah, I mean, she always said
she wanted a dog but I...

18:43.320 --> 18:44.913
I think that was just to annoy my mum.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.590
You know, maybe she's just gone off
dating a fugitive

18:47.920 --> 18:49.296
wants to embrace the suburban dream.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.357
Y'know, mortgage, steady job,
couple of kids...

18:51.400 --> 18:52.356
Can't see it myself.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.216
Don't be fooled by the dyed hair
and the piercings.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.515
She's a home-maker at heart.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.360
Y'know, or maybe she just
didn't wanna be stuck in a vehicle

19:00.400 --> 19:01.914
with her boyfriend and his ex

19:01.960 --> 19:03.553
who also happens to be
her big sister.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.320
You walked out on me.
- You were safe there.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.920
You could've called me.
- My mum was sick. I had to help her.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.753
You didn't have to sleep with Ruby.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.519
That's my fucking sister.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.096
That's the thing with you,
you only ever think about yourself.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.176
That's not fair.
- Isn't it?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.840
Isn't that what this whole race is about?

19:19.960 --> 19:21.155
You looking after number one.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.760
Yeah, well. Born alone, die alone.

19:27.760 --> 19:28.760
Get out.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.080
Seriously?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.401
If you're that selfish,
I don't see why I should help you.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.600
You know how dangerous it is out there?

19:42.920 --> 19:45.071
Kaye, there are mooks everywhere.

20:36.680 --> 20:40.196
Professor Newman, can you hear me?

20:47.920 --> 20:50.071
Now, to ascertain your cognitive functions

20:50.120 --> 20:53.192
I want you to list the first five elements
of the periodic table.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.913
Hy... Hydrogen.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.520
Helium, Lithium...

21:02.520 --> 21:04.477
Beryllium, Boron.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.799
Now, can you repeat in descending order?

21:09.040 --> 21:11.350
Boron, Beryllium, Lithium...

21:12.080 --> 21:13.912
Helium, Hydro... where am I?

21:14.360 --> 21:17.558
You're in the central Brookeheath
Administrative Building.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.976
I'm well aware of your breadth
of knowledge and experience, Helen

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
so I'm going to be completely
transparent with you.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.280
You've been infected.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.956
You've been in a period of suspended
animation for a long period of time.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.194
Process hasn't resolved in you,
I don't know why

21:33.480 --> 21:37.315
but to revive you, I've administered
a dose of dexamfetamine.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.310
What dose have you given me?

21:41.400 --> 21:42.470
Two hundred milligrams.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.435
Now, as I'm sure you're aware

21:46.480 --> 21:49.678
the side effects
of such a large dose are extreme.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.120
Not to mention illegal.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.715
Well, we've lost a lot of restrictions
since the outbreak

21:56.760 --> 21:58.319
of the November 13th virus.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.352
<i>What do you want to know so badly?</i>

22:03.600 --> 22:05.956
<i>I want to know about
one of your former patients</i>

22:06.640 --> 22:07.640
<i>Michael Garwick.</i>

22:11.120 --> 22:13.191
I don't see myself as a bad man.

22:14.280 --> 22:15.509
People can say what they want.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.594
I was the wrong guy in the wrong place
in the wrong time.

22:20.560 --> 22:22.631
Some might say that the people
in the wrong place

22:22.680 --> 22:25.240
were those living
in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.317
Look, I did what I did

22:28.120 --> 22:31.352
to save the people living
in the rest of the United Kingdom.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.631
Yeah, but it didn't, did it?

22:34.480 --> 22:36.119
Well, history can be the judge of that.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.958
We did what we had to do.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.674
And, and we will keep doing it.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.277
I'm, I'm wondering about, um...

22:45.480 --> 22:46.914
the feelings of guilt

22:47.560 --> 22:49.472
you mentioned in our last session.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.153
I'd like to get back to that.

22:52.040 --> 22:55.795
It wasn't my idea to employ
strategic weapons in Scotland, but...

22:56.160 --> 22:59.392
extreme situations call for extreme measures.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.596
The attempt to contain the virus
may not have worked

23:04.720 --> 23:08.157
but it was calculated risk.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.153
Do you think that the new measures
are necessary?

23:13.320 --> 23:15.630
I thought you weren't supposed
to express an opinion.

23:15.840 --> 23:19.550
I'm not - you expressed reservations
about the curfew on previous occasions.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.196
I'm sick of people moaning
about civil liberties.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.791
The virus has to be contained.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.554
If that means changing the way
we live our lives

23:27.600 --> 23:29.910
then I'm sorry,
but that's what we've got to do.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.637
People want the curfew.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.635
They want to be safe.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.240
Is that so bad?

23:39.720 --> 23:40.720
Time's up.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.430
Yet every week you sit there,
saying nothing...

23:53.360 --> 23:55.033
silently passing judgment on me.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.560
I know you say you don't...

23:58.040 --> 23:59.474
but I can see it in your eyes.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.437
Maybe we should cover that
in our next session.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.592
Maybe. Maybe not.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.616
<i>Sorry to interrupt</i>

24:17.640 --> 24:19.600
<i>but there 's a slight issue
with Mr Weston's bill.</i>

24:20.200 --> 24:23.113
<i>He refused to pay, in, er,
no uncertain terms...</i>

24:25.200 --> 24:26.236
What did he say?

24:27.520 --> 24:29.000
<i>He told me to shove it up my arse.</i>

24:31.720 --> 24:32.720
And did you?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.559
<i>Er... no, I didn't.</i>

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Good.

24:40.880 --> 24:41.880
That's good.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.879
So how's this doohickey work?

24:54.600 --> 24:56.273
This, man, is cutting edge

24:56.360 --> 24:58.192
in government-issue information technology.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.960
Look, look, feel how sturdy it is, man.
Feel it.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.715
Yeah, man. You can't get this kinda thing
in the shops, y'know.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.680
Let me show you something, yeah.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.040
<i>The curfew will begin in ten minutes.</i>

25:12.240 --> 25:13.071
Shit.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.240
Nah, nah, it won't.
I'm just showing you how it works.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.632
People are gonna love these things, y'know.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.880
They tell you where you need to be,
exactly when you need to be there by.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.519
You don't have to worry about a thing.

25:26.240 --> 25:27.240
Exactly.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.440
<i>Maybe you didn't want to live
in a world like this anymore.</i>

25:36.920 --> 25:39.992
Maybe you wanted to believe
that cut was a bite.

25:40.960 --> 25:44.112
Maybe you wanted to become a mook,
live free...

25:44.720 --> 25:46.200
give into your baser instincts

25:47.000 --> 25:48.760
and now you're disappointed that you're not.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.280
I'm freer than you.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.040
I know who you are.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.635
You were a normal guy.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.913
But after the curfew, you went crazy.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.478
My son showed me your videos
on the internet.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.913
You're the guys who film themselves

26:02.120 --> 26:04.237
doing stupid stunts
and then post it all online.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.437
Hear that, Cheese? She's a fan of the show.

26:07.720 --> 26:08.720
Would you like a badge?

26:09.040 --> 26:11.680
Cos I've got badges, y'know.
Look at this, eh?

26:12.200 --> 26:14.874
Look at this, there!
That's for you, babes, that one.

26:17.600 --> 26:20.195
You act like you're crazy
but you're putting it on.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.920
You're just as scared as me.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.276
All this mad bullshit is a defence.

26:24.840 --> 26:28.151
You spend your time listening
to crap music and drinking cocktails

26:28.200 --> 26:30.669
making out that life's just a game
and nothing really matters.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.680
Well, I'm sorry, but it does.

26:33.880 --> 26:34.880
It does matter.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.790
On the contrary...

26:41.160 --> 26:42.160
we're living the dream.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.959
Life is a joke, and death...

26:49.480 --> 26:51.870
is to be embraced, not feared.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.953
And it's not polite to criticise music
you do not understand.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.437
You're the one that's scared of life.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.793
That's why you don't take it seriously.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.872
You're too scared to feel anything

27:06.200 --> 27:07.919
so don't talk to me about my feelings.

27:09.680 --> 27:12.115
I'd like to get back to your children.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.995
Why you abandoned them.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.192

30:00.120 --> 30:01.120
Michael!

31:07.160 --> 31:10.153
Now, we know for a fact
that Michael Garwick was injected

31:10.200 --> 31:11.873
with an early strain of the virus

31:11.920 --> 31:13.832
in the trials that you oversaw.

31:16.400 --> 31:19.120
Now, there must be something
in his plasma cells

31:19.920 --> 31:24.949
that blocks the surface proteins
from entering white blood cells.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.276
Do you know how many people were killed
by smallpox in the 20th century?

31:31.560 --> 31:32.596
Five hundred million.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.918
And how many have died of it since 1979?

31:36.120 --> 31:38.237
None, because it's been eradicated.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.751
And how did Edward Jenner achieve this?

31:41.520 --> 31:46.595
You realise that milkmaids infected
with cowpox were immune to the disease.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.833
He carefully examined the background history

31:50.400 --> 31:52.835
of a specific specimen selection

31:53.000 --> 31:56.072
that were displaying the results
he was looking for.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.999
Are you saying I need to look deeper
into the patient's medical history?

31:59.040 --> 32:02.078
I'm saying that whatever caused him
to produce antibodies

32:02.400 --> 32:04.392
happened before the trial began.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.758
The key lies in his past.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.036
But why are you so bothered,
Mr Underhill?

32:11.400 --> 32:13.960
The people you're working for
don't want a cure.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.476
They're only interested in one thing...

32:20.080 --> 32:21.080
that's power.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Thanks.

32:27.520 --> 32:28.520
What for?

32:28.600 --> 32:29.795
You saved my life back there.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.958
You know, when me and Ruby got together...

32:41.000 --> 32:42.880
Yeah, you really, really
don't need to go there.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.400
Let me just say what I've got to say.

32:44.960 --> 32:47.040
Then we don't have to
talk about it again, I promise.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.196
It wasn't that I didn't think about
how you might feel.

32:55.080 --> 32:56.880
I thought maybe
you wouldn't be that bothered.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.480
Do you love her?

33:07.400 --> 33:08.400
Of course not.

33:10.880 --> 33:11.916
You don't love anyone.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.440
I loved you.

33:27.360 --> 33:28.919
Now, I know you're angry, Jenny.

33:29.040 --> 33:32.192
But that doesn't have to be a bad thing.
That is a real emotion.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.277
The anger you're feeling right now,
that is real.

33:34.320 --> 33:35.197
It's real, alright.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.072
That's right. And it's the truth, right?

33:37.160 --> 33:38.160
It's a true emotion.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.511
And it's the truth
that is gonna set you free.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.197
Now, how did you feel
when you left your children?

33:43.280 --> 33:44.440
You want to know what I felt?

33:46.080 --> 33:47.080
Relief.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.919
That they'd do better without me.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.597
I'd slow them down, be too cautious...

33:54.640 --> 33:56.438
not take the risks they needed to to win.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.949
That's right.
And what is it you're afraid of losing?

33:59.000 --> 34:00.200
Why are you so scared of risk?

34:00.240 --> 34:01.640
I'm not scared of losing.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.520
I wanted it to be a bite.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.156
That's how my husband died.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
I wanted to join him.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.320
Keep going.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.320
Keep going.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.719
I didn't want to see my children
killed in a crash or...

34:23.120 --> 34:24.520
turned into one of those things.

34:26.960 --> 34:27.960
I wanted to die.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.320
I wanted to die before they did.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.560
Thank you, Jenny. Thank you.

34:37.800 --> 34:38.870
For your honesty.

34:40.360 --> 34:41.360
Doesn't that feel good?

34:43.280 --> 34:44.280
Yeah.

34:47.199 --> 34:48.856
I think you're ready to go back
to your family

34:48.880 --> 34:50.040
I think she's ready.
- Woohoo!

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
That's good.

35:04.880 --> 35:07.475
Not my board, man.
I'm begging you, please, not my board.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.176
We'll get you another one
when we get to the island.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.759
Are you ready, Jenny? How you feeling?

35:10.880 --> 35:12.837
Ready for what?
Why don't we just pull over?

35:12.920 --> 35:13.920
Absolutely not.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.639
You're scared of risk, right?

35:15.720 --> 35:19.031
This is gonna be so cathartic
it's just giving me goosebumps.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.313
Why are there wheels on that surf board?

35:29.520 --> 35:30.520
Alright.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.479
When I give my assistant the nod,
he's gonna throw that lever

35:33.960 --> 35:37.351
and you're gonna shoot out of there
like a cork out of a bottle.

35:37.720 --> 35:40.713
It only hurts if you fall off.
- Or if you crash into something as well.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.029
Or something crashes into you.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.398
Alright. Now, whatever you do,
you don't look at the road.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.715
You focus on the board

35:47.760 --> 35:51.310
and how it's gonna deliver you
to the relative safety

35:51.360 --> 35:52.396
of your loving family.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.270
Listen, Jenny, you're not gonna die.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.040
You know why?

35:58.560 --> 36:01.473
Cos you're not ready to die, are you? No.

36:01.640 --> 36:02.994
This board is life

36:03.560 --> 36:06.120
and you're not ready to let go of it, right?

36:07.600 --> 36:08.600
Alright, how we looking?

36:09.240 --> 36:10.240
Nearly there.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.913
Isn't that the van Mum was in?

36:17.640 --> 36:18.640
What the hell?

36:19.320 --> 36:20.436
Here they come.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.240
Hold her steady.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.120
Ease off the gas a little bit.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.150
Thank you, Dr Jones.

36:31.240 --> 36:32.879
Capitano. CD.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.440
This is your prescription.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.192
Take it twice a day before meals.

36:42.760 --> 36:43.760
Cheese.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.270

Mum!

37:34.120 --> 37:35.315
Are you alright, Mum?

37:35.960 --> 37:38.156
I'm OK. I'm actually OK.

37:38.480 --> 37:39.550
We thought we'd lost you.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.712
I thought I'd been bitten, but I'm OK.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.035
Sorry for leaving you.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.635
What... what happened?

37:52.800 --> 37:54.632
That is a thing of beauty, there, Cheese.

37:54.800 --> 37:55.677
Whoa!

37:55.760 --> 37:58.639
Oh, take it easy, mate.
You'll do yourself a mischief.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.516
Gotta get my board back.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.480
Brutus, look who it is!

38:04.360 --> 38:06.477
Look who came back!

38:08.000 --> 38:09.593
Are they completely mad?

38:10.360 --> 38:11.430
Nah, they're not mad.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.520
They're just misunderstood.

38:26.920 --> 38:30.152
You know, I've always known
when a moment turns into a memory

38:31.720 --> 38:32.995
and this, my friend...

38:34.640 --> 38:35.640
is gonna be a fond one.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.080
Yeah, man.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.474
One for the road, El Capitano?

38:41.840 --> 38:42.840
Don't mind if I do.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.560
I'm not slowing down.

38:51.440 --> 38:52.635
Not slowing down for anyone.

38:53.480 --> 38:54.357
Yeah...

38:54.480 --> 38:56.073
Don't think we should hang about, guys.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.914
Word has it the lady in that Jag there
took out three of our fellow racers.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.230
Another victim of intense emotional trauma.

39:08.840 --> 39:12.390
This one seems to have fallen
for the misguided notion

39:12.440 --> 39:16.434
that an orgy of senseless violence
will somehow bring her peace.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.312
Cheese. El Capitano.

39:18.400 --> 39:19.720
Spread out across the road.

39:21.320 --> 39:22.595
Our work is not done here yet.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.915
Clearly she has chosen the wrong team
to play chicken with.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.156
Y'know, I'm struck by something
that Jenny said

39:38.240 --> 39:40.436
while we were exploring
her repressed emotions.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.474
She turned the tables on me,
figuratively speaking

39:45.680 --> 39:49.310
she said we used our death-defying antics
as a defence mechanism

39:49.960 --> 39:52.236
because we were frightened of living.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.600
So I ask you...

39:55.080 --> 39:57.675
as we stare death in its beady little eyes

39:58.800 --> 39:59.711
who here's afraid?

39:59.760 --> 40:01.176
- Yep, definitely me.
- I'd say yeah.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.400
I'm scared, yeah.
- Absolutely.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
Very scared.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.319
And who's scared of life?

40:06.360 --> 40:07.936
Nope, I'm not, I love life.
- Nah, not me, bruv.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.758
I like life a lot, yeah, it's good, life.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.789
There we have it, gentlemen.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.040
I say we stand down.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.240
<i>I lost a patient last week.</i>

40:34.400 --> 40:36.915
Uh, that government minister
I told you about.

40:38.800 --> 40:42.032
He, um... he was too busy at work to come in

40:45.880 --> 40:47.314
but he said he felt better.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.430
And he called to thank me.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.800
And how does that make you feel?

40:54.560 --> 40:55.676
Like a fool.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.030
And an imposter.

40:59.920 --> 41:00.990
Because he's not better.

41:02.640 --> 41:03.835
The man is a monster.

41:06.080 --> 41:09.437
He killed two million people
and wears it like a badge of pride.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.360
People think he's a hero

41:14.560 --> 41:19.476
and they promote him
to the Ministry of Internal Security

41:19.560 --> 41:20.789
whatever the hell that is.

41:21.440 --> 41:24.353
And he thinks I've cured him,
and I have made him worse.

41:25.360 --> 41:28.831
It strikes me that you're very angry

41:28.880 --> 41:30.997
about what could be described
as a positive outcome.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.675
It's not just him.

41:39.880 --> 41:40.880
It's the curfew.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.110
They like it.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.358
The certainty, the...

41:49.960 --> 41:50.996
Being told what to do.

41:51.280 --> 41:54.751
It is like reclining
into a hot bath for them.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.750
But it's not for you?

41:57.080 --> 41:58.639
No, it is making me insane.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.840
Well, you know what they say...

42:03.320 --> 42:04.470
insanity's relative.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.996
It just depends on what side
of the cage you're on.

42:12.800 --> 42:13.836

42:55.640 --> 42:57.711
Well, I'd definitely classify that
under "weird".

42:57.880 --> 42:59.758
Yeah, weird and really annoying.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.951
That's because you weren't listening.

43:02.520 --> 43:05.797
