08:26.854 --> 08:28.266
Meh, who's to say
who followed who, you know?

08:28.290 --> 08:30.205
I am. I'm saying
you followed me.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.554
Can I get a Bahama Mama,
but instead of the
orange slice,

08:32.599 --> 08:34.688
can I just get extra rum?
Thank you.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.167
What star of The Breakfast Club

08:36.211 --> 08:38.299
was in the original cast
of Facts of Life?

08:38.866 --> 08:40.258
Tootie?

08:40.302 --> 08:41.563
Molly Ringwald.

08:41.607 --> 08:43.479
Correct!

08:43.523 --> 08:45.786
"Tootie"? Seriously?
I'm sorry.

08:45.829 --> 08:48.571
My brain isn't stuffed full
of useless pop-culture fluff.

08:48.615 --> 08:51.052
But mine is, which would make us

08:51.095 --> 08:54.011
the perfect teammates,
the Salt-N-Pepa of trivia.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.186
No idea who that is.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.710
Exactly why you need me.

08:58.842 --> 08:59.842
Fine.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.735
You missed
the whole point
of Rudy.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.065
Rudy earned his moment of glory.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.370
It wasn't just handed to him.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.372
Wah-wah.
Nobody cares
about that.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.809
What Rudy did on the field

09:08.852 --> 09:10.811
is the reason
they turned his story

09:10.854 --> 09:12.769
into a beautiful movie
about sports triumph.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.379
Our little Toby
just got to taste

09:14.423 --> 09:16.077
the sweet nectar of victory.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.520
What's he gonna taste
in a real game

09:17.557 --> 09:19.559
when all his face holes
get smashed in?

09:19.602 --> 09:20.777
Won't happen.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.039
Saturday is our last game,

09:22.083 --> 09:23.606
and I'm gonna keep him
on the bench.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.174
But he'll always
have the memory
of today's glory

09:26.217 --> 09:29.481
as he slogs through
the next 50 years
as a wimpy nobody,

09:29.525 --> 09:31.875
trying to brighten his day
with kooky ties.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.311
Ah, really?

09:33.355 --> 09:35.183
We're going there,
Mr. Short Shorts?

09:35.226 --> 09:36.226
Coach Mellor!

09:37.141 --> 09:39.709
Oh. Hi. Hi.

09:39.753 --> 09:40.841
Toby's Aunt Julie.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.886
Oh, please, just call me Julie.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.236
Julie.
I got here early
to pick up Toby

09:45.280 --> 09:46.586
and I saw
that last amazing play.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.239
I took the rock to the house!

09:48.283 --> 09:50.111
Sure did, buddy.
All you.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.200
Will Toby be playing
on Saturday, too?

09:52.243 --> 09:53.873
I wasn't gonna come,
but if Toby is playing,

09:53.897 --> 09:56.857
I'd love to see it,
and maybe afterwards,

09:56.900 --> 09:58.965
we could go out
for pizza and you
and I could catch up.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.837
Of course he's playing.
You saw him take it
to the house,

10:00.861 --> 10:02.123
all on his own there.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.951
Well, we'll see you
Saturday.Okay.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.563
Holy crap,
that got away from me.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.130
I might have just killed Toby.

10:09.173 --> 10:10.847
Well, on the bright side,
at least you can bring

10:10.871 --> 10:12.307
Aunt Julie as a date
to the funeral.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.748
Wilma and I were
vastly different people,

10:18.792 --> 10:21.011
but those very differences
made us an awesome team.

10:21.055 --> 10:22.796
Uranium-235.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.928
Blink-182.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.277
Johannes Diderik van der Waals.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.757
James Van Der Beek.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.541
The identification
of chromosomes

10:29.585 --> 10:31.369
as the carriers
of genetic material

10:31.413 --> 10:33.502
as stated in
the Boveri-Sutton theory!

10:33.545 --> 10:35.983
Pogs.
Correct answer!

10:36.026 --> 10:39.334
Mmm!
Time to tally up the score
and announce our winner.

10:39.377 --> 10:42.076
Winners.
That would be us.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.947
I'm so glad
you stalked me
here tonight.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.969
If we win,
I probably won't even
call the cops on you.

10:45.993 --> 10:48.299
Listen, I have an
extra ticket to a show.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.277
Do you want to go to Philly
with me for the weekend

10:50.301 --> 10:51.825
to have a spa day
and see Boyz II Men?

10:51.868 --> 10:54.479
That sounds really nice,
but I don't even
know that group.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.872
I'll Make Love to You.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.197
I think you may have
different expectations

10:57.221 --> 10:58.372
for this friendship than I do.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.747
No, that's one of
their hits. Like...

11:00.790 --> 11:03.358
♪ Motown Philly's

11:03.401 --> 11:06.187
♪ Doing a little
east-coast fling

Oh, I do know them.

Yes!

11:15.892 --> 11:18.068
♪ Motown Philly's back again ♪

11:20.114 --> 11:21.855
Really stressed about this.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.726
You can't let Toby
play on Saturday.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.510
I also can't let the kid down.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.121
Or his aunt.
Mmm-hmm.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.664
Eh, you made me
lose count of
my blueberries.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.385
Look, it's better to break
Toby's heart

11:30.428 --> 11:32.300
than all the bones
in his body, okay?

11:32.343 --> 11:35.259
It is our job as teachers
to deliver hard truths
to these kids.

11:35.303 --> 11:36.870
Coach, check it out.

11:36.913 --> 11:40.656
Oh. It's a Toby-sized
letterman jacket.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.590
Is that the one they made
for our halftime monkey

11:42.614 --> 11:44.878
before those wet blankets
at PETA shut us down?

11:44.921 --> 11:46.357
I'm the one who reported that.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.577
Monkey seemed so sad.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.622
I'm just so proud to wear it.

11:50.666 --> 11:53.800
CB, you had some hard truth
you wanted to dump on Toby?

11:53.843 --> 11:54.844
Yes.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.195
That jacket is dry-clean only.

11:58.239 --> 12:00.328
Could get pretty pricy. Worth it.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.460
And plus, I've never felt
so popular before.

12:02.504 --> 12:05.681
And I've even
seen a downward
trend in my pantsings.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.857
The only question is
do we get our cheesesteaks

12:07.901 --> 12:08.921
before or after the pedicures?

12:08.945 --> 12:10.468
During. We don't eat
with our feet.

12:10.512 --> 12:11.512
Ding!
Correct answer.

12:12.601 --> 12:13.733
Well, look at you two.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.299
Do I hear friendship bells?

12:15.343 --> 12:16.692
Ooh.
Friendship Belles.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.409
That should be our new name
for trivia night.Ooh.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.696
Nothing makes me happier
than when my teachers

12:20.740 --> 12:23.133
grow very close
with someone
other than me.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.504
Oh, my God. Look at the way
he's eating his yogurt.

12:26.528 --> 12:27.635
Just like the guy
from last night.

12:27.659 --> 12:28.791
Right?

12:28.835 --> 12:30.488
Soupy!

12:30.532 --> 12:32.534
You know what?
I'm gonna go eat
in my office.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.144
Yogurt should be private.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.495
Hello?

12:37.539 --> 12:40.237
Erica, what's up, girl?

12:40.281 --> 12:42.065
Your mom's party's
been canceled?

12:42.109 --> 12:44.435
There's rain in the forecast
and the doves refuse
to work wet.

12:44.459 --> 12:45.739
Your mom must be
out of her mind.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.872
Who is she taking it out on?

12:46.896 --> 12:48.942
At the moment, Al Roker.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.640
But the good news is that
I'm back in for Boyz II Men.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.033
So, now you can do this weekend?

12:54.904 --> 12:56.776
Um, the thing is, actually, I...

12:56.819 --> 12:59.256
It's okay.
Don't worry about me.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.494
Are you sure?
Yeah, just go
with your friend.

13:00.518 --> 13:01.518
I feel bad.
Yeah, don't.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.435
Alright. I guess
I'll see you on Friday.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.655
Girls II Boyz
II Men. Yay.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.919
Sorry about that.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.462
Erica's my oldest friend
and I asked her first.

13:11.486 --> 13:12.792
Makes perfect sense.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.229
But you are officially
my coolest friend

13:15.272 --> 13:16.902
because you are
being so cool
about all this,

13:16.926 --> 13:18.754
which is so cool.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.799
Cool.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.040
Oh, my God. Check out
that girl dipping her fries
in her chocolate milk,

13:24.064 --> 13:25.369
just like Dippy last night.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.632
Do you remember Dippy?

13:27.676 --> 13:29.112
I should get to class.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.201
Wait, come on.
Eh, Soupy's date.

13:31.245 --> 13:32.681
Dippy. Dippy!

13:32.724 --> 13:34.204
Listen, last night was great.

13:34.248 --> 13:35.902
Trivia, Soupy.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.618
Let's just be good
with that and not try
to make more of it.

13:37.642 --> 13:41.081
♪♪

13:41.124 --> 13:43.474
CB! Come on in here.
I got some good news.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.737
I figured out a way to get
this kid to play Saturday

13:45.781 --> 13:46.845
without having
to rename the field

13:46.869 --> 13:48.828
"Toby Murphy
Memorial Stadium."

13:48.871 --> 13:51.047
Thank God.
I was so stressed.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.527
I had to juggle it out
all morning.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.679
You can't put that little
nose hair on the field,
Coach.

13:54.703 --> 13:55.941
It's the last game
of the season.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.358
I-I got scouts coming.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.794
My whole troop.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.972
We're gonna run one play,
and it goes like this.

14:03.016 --> 14:07.107
It's called the
Red Dog 86 Omaha
Don't Let Toby Die.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.978
Oh, I feel very
uncomfortable with this.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.025
So, this is another
big fake-out,

14:12.068 --> 14:13.480
like when we let Toby
think he scored
a touchdown?

14:13.504 --> 14:15.028
Exactly.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.049
We just give him
the ball and then we
move him downfield

14:17.073 --> 14:19.859
like a herd of elephants
guarding a tiny,
useless duckling.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.078
So, this has all been a lie?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.603
Toby.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.867
Well, okay,
the touchdown, maybe,

14:27.910 --> 14:30.043
but that feeling it gave you,

14:30.086 --> 14:31.871
that moment of glory,
that was real.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.481
I didn't ask for glory.

14:33.524 --> 14:34.893
I asked for a shot
to be part of the team.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.112
And now I see I'm just a joke.

14:36.136 --> 14:37.267
You're not a joke.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.108
Yeah.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.504
That's the
last time I do something
completely selfless.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.027
Selfless?

14:58.071 --> 14:59.396
You weren't even
thinking about Toby.

14:59.420 --> 15:01.335
Seems to me like
you were more interested

15:01.378 --> 15:02.703
in grabbing a pizza
with Aunt Julie.

15:02.727 --> 15:03.903
That's ridiculous.

I tried to score
an extra ticket for Wilma.

pawned you off on Wilma?

I blew that friendship.

but the heart feels
what the mouth won't say.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.949
I was trying to protect Erica
because she is my
oldest friend.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.168
Which is why it's okay
to treat her like crap.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.605
This new friendship
with Wilma is fragile

15:54.649 --> 15:56.216

16:29.249 --> 16:30.641
I think that's fair.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.948
You tricked me and made me
a laughing stock at school.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.691
As a teacher,
you want to tell your kids

16:36.734 --> 16:38.519
they can do anything
they set their mind to,

16:38.562 --> 16:40.216
but sometimes,
that's just a crock.

16:40.260 --> 16:43.132
Look, I've always wanted
to be a jockey,

16:43.176 --> 16:46.744
but unfortunately,
I'm six feet of solid
tiger meat.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.485
But I really love football.

16:48.529 --> 16:51.314
And you can still
be a part of it.

16:51.358 --> 16:54.056
I'm about to pay you
the highest compliment
possible.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.841
Toby, I think
you could be a coach.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.192
I mean, I'm looking
at some of the plays
you've drawn up.

16:59.235 --> 17:00.473
There's a lot
of smart strategy here.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.108
Maybe someday.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.737
But I've always had
my heart set on playing

17:03.761 --> 17:05.589
a real game, just once.

17:07.242 --> 17:08.592
Okay, pal.

17:08.636 --> 17:11.160
I owe you.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.380
You're going out
on that field on Saturday,

17:13.423 --> 17:15.077
and the reason it's gonna work

17:15.121 --> 17:17.297
is we're running
one of your plays.

17:17.339 --> 17:19.339
Remember how I said I wasn't
in this for the glory?

17:20.473 --> 17:23.215
I would very much
like some glory, please.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.671

Hey. Could you use these

I'm doing
a presentation
on mold,

17:38.274 --> 17:40.059

has scribbled on

17:40.102 --> 17:41.277
with green marker.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.978
Well, it was supposed to be
kind of a peace offering.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.893
Shouldn't you be
in Philly with Erica,

17:48.937 --> 17:52.288
getting Shiatsu'd
with a belly full
of cheesesteak?

17:52.332 --> 17:55.422
I didn't go.
I gave Erica
both tickets.

17:55.465 --> 17:58.251
I just couldn't enjoy myself
after how I treated you.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.706
I'm actually grateful
because you reminded me

17:59.730 --> 18:01.558
why I'm not so keen
on girlfriends.

18:01.602 --> 18:04.300
So much more relaxing
spending my free time

18:04.344 --> 18:06.389
with Aspergillus fumigatus.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.999
She's reliable, self-sufficient,

18:08.043 --> 18:09.629
and we both like
hanging out in my bathtub.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.307
But can she drive you
to the airport

18:11.351 --> 18:12.763
or hold your hair
when you're vomiting?

18:12.787 --> 18:15.181
No, but she can
make you vomit.
Very toxic.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.313
And then penicillin
will fix you right up.

18:17.357 --> 18:20.273
That's the wild ride
mold takes you on.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.449

18:22.492 --> 18:24.625
and I don't seem
to make friends
easily anymore.

it's happening,

18:26.017 --> 18:27.628
I do not take no for an answer.

18:27.671 --> 18:30.457
Ask around.
I-I'm as hard

on that toothbrush.
