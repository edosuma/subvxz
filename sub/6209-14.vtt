WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:04.369
I've done it.

00:04.546 --> 00:07.169
I'm on the verge of one
of the greatest scientific breakthroughs

00:07.341 --> 00:09.418
in the history of mankind.

00:09.593 --> 00:12.261
How incredible.
Are you gonna finish that toast?

00:12.428 --> 00:14.173
You know that formula
I've been working on?

00:14.347 --> 00:16.886
- I've found the key ingredient.
- Liquorice?

00:17.058 --> 00:19.431
Don't be silly, Sabrina.
Liquorice won't cure allergies.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.725
It's ostrich saliva.

00:21.895 --> 00:26.605
The hard part is getting them to drool.
Let me see that. Oh!

00:27.442 --> 00:28.522
Wow.

00:28.735 --> 00:31.144
One drop of that and the whole kitchen
is spotlessly clean.

00:31.321 --> 00:33.942
I'll say.
The walls, the table, the counters--

00:34.114 --> 00:36.357
- Salem.
- I'm blond.

00:36.534 --> 00:38.942
My IQ just dropped 20 points.

00:39.119 --> 00:42.869
Blond, blond, blond. Dead.

00:44.958 --> 00:45.990
See you.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:03.225 --> 01:05.183
What's all the flap?

01:10.523 --> 01:14.224
I got a postcard from Valerie.
She's really enjoying her trip to D.C.

01:14.402 --> 01:16.728
"Hi, everyone,
I visited the Vietnam Memorial,

01:16.904 --> 01:19.739
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,
and J.F.K.'s grave.

01:19.906 --> 01:21.900
This place is really fun."

01:22.075 --> 01:24.116
Sounds like a big loser town to me.

01:24.286 --> 01:25.995
I have an important announcement
to make.

01:26.163 --> 01:27.622
The school will be entering a float

01:27.789 --> 01:30.363
in the town's
Democracy Daze celebration.

01:30.541 --> 01:33.744
Great, I get to hear
my dad's Grenada story again.

01:33.919 --> 01:37.289
Now, who would like to be in charge
of putting the float together?

01:37.464 --> 01:39.126
Oh, my.

01:44.304 --> 01:47.056
Well, I think this
would be the perfect opportunity

01:47.223 --> 01:50.391
for the two of you to embody
our democracy's two-party system

01:50.560 --> 01:51.675
and work together.

01:51.852 --> 01:53.347
What?

01:53.520 --> 01:55.597
Libby.
I've got a great idea for the float.

01:55.772 --> 01:57.766
I say we display
some of our major headlines

01:57.941 --> 01:59.935
using recycled newspaper.

02:00.110 --> 02:01.309
No, no, no.

02:01.486 --> 02:04.737
The newspaper print would
get all over the cheerleaders' uniforms.

02:04.906 --> 02:07.362
Why would cheerleaders be on a float
with a newspaper theme?

02:07.533 --> 02:10.820
They're always on the front page,
duh.

02:11.871 --> 02:12.951
What?

02:13.622 --> 02:16.742
Man, this house is so spotless
and germ-free,

02:16.917 --> 02:18.376
Howard Hughes could live here.

02:18.543 --> 02:21.794
Zelda, if we could market this stuff,
we'd make a fortune.

02:21.963 --> 02:25.297
Good luck. The FDA
will never approve of ostrich saliva.

02:25.466 --> 02:28.551
Those pencil-pushing bureaucrats
have ruined many a dream.

02:28.719 --> 02:31.045
Well, we could still sell it
in the Other Realm.

02:31.222 --> 02:33.548
- What do you say, Zeldie?
- No.

02:33.724 --> 02:36.511
I made this formula to cure allergies
and end suffering,

02:36.684 --> 02:37.848
not to whiten.

02:38.019 --> 02:39.847
You ever cleaned a toilet?
That's suffering.

02:40.563 --> 02:43.233
Besides, you said
it didn't even cure allergies.

02:43.399 --> 02:44.681
Yet.

02:44.859 --> 02:47.777
Medical breakthroughs take time.
Get off my back.

02:47.945 --> 02:50.484
This is why
Pasteur broke up with you.

02:50.656 --> 02:53.527
He told me he had to work out stuff
with his mother.

02:54.243 --> 02:57.198
You gotta hand it to Zelda.
She's a pillar of integrity.

02:57.371 --> 03:01.036
Yeah. Let's steal her formula.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.038
The school guidelines state

03:04.210 --> 03:06.916
that the float is required
to have flowers.

03:07.088 --> 03:10.753
- The rest of the design is up to me.
- Don't you mean "us"?

03:10.924 --> 03:14.543
Well, I'll be using "me"
as shorthand for "us."

03:14.719 --> 03:17.638
I've already got the floral design
in my head.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.883
Oh. Well, I'm glad
your butt is working.

03:20.058 --> 03:23.094
Oh, I'll be using "butt"
as shorthand for "your head."

03:25.813 --> 03:27.937
The coast is clear.

03:28.649 --> 03:30.808
Operation Find the Allergy Formula
That Also Cleans,

03:30.985 --> 03:32.693
Don't Get Caught,
And Make a Lot of Money

03:32.861 --> 03:33.976
is under way.

03:34.154 --> 03:38.022
You start looking, and I'll start working
on a shorter code name. Ha-ha.

03:38.575 --> 03:40.983
Aah! Harvey.
What are you doing under there?

03:41.161 --> 03:42.360
Souping up the engine.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.279
This baby will be able
to go 90 miles an hour.

03:45.455 --> 03:47.200
But we're behind
the World War II veterans.

03:47.374 --> 03:48.869
Haven't they suffered enough?

03:53.422 --> 03:55.082
Perfect.

03:57.842 --> 03:59.882
Libby, we agreed
this would be my side.

04:00.386 --> 04:02.344
Oh. I'm sorry.

04:02.513 --> 04:05.514
I thought we wanted the float
to look nice.

04:08.351 --> 04:10.012
- Found it.
- Hallelujah.

04:11.563 --> 04:15.265
What in the Other Realm's name
is going on here?

04:15.442 --> 04:18.277
- Lost my wallet?
- She's telling the truth, I swear.

04:18.444 --> 04:21.944
And now that I've found it, Salem and I
will just get back to work and clean up.

04:22.113 --> 04:24.322
Are we ever gonna clean up. Ha-ha.

04:30.622 --> 04:34.122
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

04:34.292 --> 04:35.835
Libby, leave my side alone.

04:36.336 --> 04:40.168
Sorry, I will not allow the town
to be subjected to this.

04:41.340 --> 04:42.965
That's it, I can't take it anymore.

04:43.133 --> 04:46.336
<i>To keep us out of each other's faces
Keep Libby away at least five paces</i>

04:46.512 --> 04:48.221
And, Sab-- Ooh!

04:58.022 --> 05:00.348
I said "cheerful"
and you picked yellow?

05:02.526 --> 05:05.729
Me and my finger.
Now, that's teamwork.

05:08.949 --> 05:11.523
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the spell police.

05:11.701 --> 05:13.611
The distance spell
you put on Libby is illegal.

05:13.786 --> 05:15.661
- Why?
- Because you can't distance yourself

05:15.830 --> 05:17.111
from your problems.

05:17.289 --> 05:19.616
- Really? Watch.
- Freeze.

05:22.002 --> 05:24.328
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cite you.

05:25.630 --> 05:29.082
"If a distance spell is enacted,
it will be reversed"? Huh?

05:29.259 --> 05:30.837
Instead of Libby
staying away from you,

05:31.010 --> 05:32.719
you have to stay next to Libby.

05:32.887 --> 05:34.382
- What?
- And if you do happen to move

05:34.556 --> 05:37.557
more than five paces away,
something terrible will happen.

05:37.724 --> 05:41.770
Something that will scare you
to the depths of your soul.

05:41.937 --> 05:43.895
Say hi to Libby for me.

05:44.064 --> 05:46.555
You're a disgrace to your badge!

05:49.110 --> 05:50.190
Ew.

05:52.029 --> 05:55.898
You are so right. Ha-ha.

05:56.701 --> 05:59.073
You know,
when I said "Ew" just now,

05:59.244 --> 06:02.080
I wasn't being rhetorical.

06:03.707 --> 06:05.202
Aah...

06:06.168 --> 06:07.200
Satisfied?

06:07.377 --> 06:10.793
You just scared off a cute guy
with your freak pheromones.

06:16.385 --> 06:18.545
Don't you dare look in my locker.

06:18.721 --> 06:20.879
I wasn't. My, uh, new locker's here.

06:28.730 --> 06:31.731
- Where are you going?
- To cheerleading practise.

06:31.899 --> 06:34.355
<i>Ready, get lost.</i>

06:34.526 --> 06:37.314
Hey, you know, that would make
a good story for the school paper:

06:37.488 --> 06:39.197
"A Day in the Life of a Cheerleader."

06:39.364 --> 06:43.528
But you despise cheerleaders.
And cheerleaders despise you.

06:43.701 --> 06:45.362
You're afraid I'll write a puff piece.

06:45.536 --> 06:48.372
Well, look, don't worry--

06:48.539 --> 06:49.916
Here it comes.

06:50.082 --> 06:53.333
<i>This dungeon stone is white,
but what would you call this one?</i>

06:53.502 --> 06:55.045
<i>- Bright.
- Exactly.</i>

06:55.212 --> 06:57.122
<i>And that's why
for the next 20 minutes,</i>

06:57.297 --> 07:00.299
<i>we'll be telling you how you can
get your house this clean with new...</i>

07:00.467 --> 07:01.962
...Scientist in a Drum.

07:02.135 --> 07:04.887
And now here's Bruce Jenner
to tell you more.

07:05.054 --> 07:09.053
I don't believe it.
You marketed my formula.

07:09.225 --> 07:11.930
And with
a poorly produced informercial.

07:12.102 --> 07:15.306
I'm taking this matter
to the Other Realm copyright court.

07:18.399 --> 07:19.432
The toaster.

07:22.362 --> 07:24.605
"Send me four bottles
of Scientist in a Drum."

07:24.781 --> 07:27.319
"Send ten bottles.
Everything you've got."

07:27.491 --> 07:29.900
These are all orders for our cleanser
from the Other Realm,

07:30.077 --> 07:31.276
after the first minute.

07:31.453 --> 07:34.289
But I wanted this formula
to be used for the common good.

07:34.456 --> 07:36.664
We polled the common good.
They don't wanna be helped.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.542
Come on, Zeldie, we need your help.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.961
Well, I guess if surfaces are clean,
that would mean a lot less dust,

07:42.130 --> 07:44.835
which could mean a lot less asthma.

07:45.007 --> 07:47.001
Exactly. You know,
Mr. Clean was this close

07:47.176 --> 07:48.422
to getting the Nobel Prize.

07:48.594 --> 07:50.254
Come on. What do you say?

07:51.847 --> 07:55.976
All right, I'll do it. For mankind.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.180
Okay, let's do it again.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.479
Sabrina, if you insist
on actually doing the cheers,

08:03.649 --> 08:07.695
you have to stop screaming,
"Please let me die."

08:07.862 --> 08:08.894
<i>Ready.</i>

08:09.071 --> 08:10.317
<i>Okay.</i>

08:10.489 --> 08:12.980
<i>Westbridge, Westbridge
Wow, wow, wow</i>

08:13.158 --> 08:16.444
<i>Stronger, faster, holier than thou</i>

08:16.619 --> 08:18.909
Whoo! Go Westbridge!

08:19.080 --> 08:23.125
- Harvey.
- Sabrina. Cheerleading?

08:23.292 --> 08:26.080
- I lost a bet.
- Okay, you guys, go take a break.

08:26.253 --> 08:30.299
You can get a drink of water and think
about how you can be more like me.

08:32.259 --> 08:34.049
You wanna go to the Slicery
and grab a bite?

08:34.217 --> 08:38.087
I'd love to. But I promised Libby
I'd sit alarmingly close to her.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.845
Why have you decided
to become my shadow

08:43.019 --> 08:44.217
all of a sudden?

08:44.395 --> 08:47.230
Well, I figured
since we're gonna be working together,

08:47.397 --> 08:49.474
you know, maybe we could
find a common ground.

08:49.649 --> 08:53.102
Any ground I found with you
would indeed be common.

08:53.737 --> 08:56.276
Ha-ha. Ha. You know, um, wait.

08:56.447 --> 08:58.737
I'm just trying
to get to know you better.

08:58.908 --> 09:01.826
Well, I'm popular, confident,
nonfreakish:

09:01.994 --> 09:03.620
everything you're not.

09:03.788 --> 09:05.413
And if you insist
on traipsing after me,

09:05.581 --> 09:08.249
could you at least
wear a higher-quality perfume?

09:08.833 --> 09:13.413
Okay, enough. Nothing is worth this.
I don't care what happens to me.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.502
Libby. Oh, no.

09:24.056 --> 09:28.635
I turned her into a puzzle.
"For ages 3 and up"?

09:33.481 --> 09:35.973
- What's that?
- I didn't do anything.

09:36.943 --> 09:41.605
Oh... I never knew working
with numbers could be so sensual.

09:41.780 --> 09:44.533
- Water. Must have water.
- Well, make it quick.

09:44.699 --> 09:47.536
We need you back in that lab,
making lots more of this stuff.

09:47.702 --> 09:49.992
Come on, chop, chop.

09:50.163 --> 09:53.283
Excuse me,
but since I invented the product,

09:53.457 --> 09:55.166
maybe I should be
running the business.

09:55.334 --> 09:57.707
You seem to assume
that you're in charge.

09:57.878 --> 10:00.548
If you wanna do everything I do,
be my guest.

10:00.714 --> 10:03.337
Okay, exactly what is it you do?

10:04.300 --> 10:07.587
- Plenty.
- Stop fighting. We're rich.

10:07.762 --> 10:09.672
And I didn't have to
marry Martha Raye.

10:09.848 --> 10:11.972
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda! Help!

10:12.600 --> 10:14.144
- What's the matter?
- Look.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.683
Uh-oh. A Libby puzzle.

10:16.854 --> 10:21.232
- Sabrina, did you blow up a mortal?
- She started it.

10:22.109 --> 10:25.146
I told her something bad would happen
if she stepped away from Libby.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.360
You can't distance yourself
from your problems.

10:27.530 --> 10:29.856
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I've heard.
What am I supposed to do?

10:30.032 --> 10:31.658
All the cheerleaders
are expecting her.

10:31.826 --> 10:34.911
I can't tell them their leader
has turned into a rainy-day activity.

10:35.079 --> 10:36.456
You have to assemble her.

10:36.622 --> 10:38.829
- And then she'll be all right?
- If you do it right.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.743
- Help.
- Of course.

10:40.917 --> 10:42.496
Now, try to calm down.

10:42.669 --> 10:45.078
I know making a classmate explode
can be stressful,

10:45.255 --> 10:47.712
but I've always found puzzles
very relaxing.

11:31.088 --> 11:33.377
Is that all there is?

11:35.258 --> 11:37.169
The box is empty.
How can we be missing pieces?

11:37.344 --> 11:38.625
Didn't you read the fine print?

11:38.804 --> 11:41.592
"Some pieces not included in box"?
What a rip-off.

11:41.765 --> 11:44.386
I guess you didn't see this, either.

11:44.558 --> 11:46.054
If you don't find the missing pieces

11:46.227 --> 11:47.888
and put them in
before the sand runs out,

11:48.062 --> 11:49.438
Libby will be a puzzle forever.

11:49.605 --> 11:51.480
- What?
- Boy, in the final analysis,

11:51.649 --> 11:53.975
the Libby puzzle isn't much fun, is it?

11:54.151 --> 11:55.480
How am I to find these pieces?

11:55.652 --> 11:57.527
You have to explore her life,
and quickly.

11:57.695 --> 12:01.741
You know, I bet other teenagers get
to spend their evenings watching TV.

12:02.617 --> 12:04.160
Zeldie, I feel bad.

12:04.327 --> 12:06.451
We should be able to work together
without fighting.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.993
I mean, we are more mature
than Libby and Sabrina.

12:09.164 --> 12:13.495
- I agree. Let's get back to business.
- But I'm still in charge, right?

12:14.503 --> 12:18.335
Aah! Whoever's in charge, get in here,
and bring some Wet-Naps.

12:18.506 --> 12:20.879
Make that a fire extinguisher.

12:24.679 --> 12:27.634
Ugh... Gross.

12:27.807 --> 12:29.764
Well, the piece
isn't in Libby's leftover lunch.

12:29.933 --> 12:32.805
- Only 45 minutes left.
- Will you stop with that?

12:32.978 --> 12:35.185
I'm worried about Libby.
I need to concentrate.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.479
That's good,
because you only have 44 minutes left.

12:39.401 --> 12:40.480
Forty-three fifty.

12:40.651 --> 12:41.897
Ooh--

12:46.157 --> 12:48.909
I'm not finding anything.

12:49.493 --> 12:51.735
Aah! Harvey.
Have you met my friend--?

12:51.911 --> 12:54.201
- <i>Invisible.</i>
- My friend Susie?

12:54.372 --> 12:55.832
Remind me
to introduce you sometime.

12:55.999 --> 12:58.491
By the way, um, you didn't happen
to see any jigsaw-puzzle pieces

12:58.668 --> 12:59.784
under there, did you?

12:59.961 --> 13:02.997
No. But to tell you the truth,
I was taking a nap.

13:03.172 --> 13:05.924
There's something really soothing
about being under an engine,

13:06.091 --> 13:07.290
but I don't know what it is.

13:07.468 --> 13:10.802
- <i>The fumes?</i>
- Shh... Sure gotta go. Ha.

13:16.893 --> 13:19.729
We're down to about a half an hour.

13:20.563 --> 13:24.229
Okay, I admit it.
I like holding up the hourglass.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.523
Maybe the piece
will be in Libby's locker.

13:26.693 --> 13:30.028
I think this one is hers. Ha-ha...

13:30.197 --> 13:32.356
Sabrina,
I hate to interrupt your conversation

13:32.532 --> 13:35.819
with the voices in your head,
but have you seen Libby?

13:35.994 --> 13:38.948
Libby? Uh... No, I haven't.
But don't worry.

13:39.121 --> 13:41.578
I'm sure she'll pull herself together
real soon.

13:48.213 --> 13:49.624
Look. Look at this notebook.

13:49.798 --> 13:52.206
It looks like Libby had a tutor
help her in math.

13:52.383 --> 13:53.843
- Weird.
- Why are you so surprised?

13:54.010 --> 13:55.671
Didn't you know
she was bad at math?

13:55.845 --> 13:58.550
Yeah, but what's surprising
is she cares that she's bad at math.

13:58.722 --> 14:01.095
Sounds like you learned
a little something about Libby.

14:01.266 --> 14:04.434
And here's a piece of the puzzle. Look,
it's got Libby's address on the back.

14:04.603 --> 14:06.015
Well, might I suggest we go there?

14:06.188 --> 14:09.558
- Especially since we--
- Oh, get a hobby.

14:10.024 --> 14:11.056
I don't care.

14:11.234 --> 14:14.520
I don't want Marge in my bridge club.
She's a kook.

14:15.988 --> 14:19.821
Have you seen
what she calls furniture? Ew.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.237
Hold on.

14:21.952 --> 14:23.198
- Mrs. Chessler?
- Yes.

14:23.370 --> 14:24.402
Hi, I'm Sabrina.

14:24.579 --> 14:25.825
I'm a friend of Libby's,

14:25.997 --> 14:28.489
and I left a book here
that I came to pick up

14:28.667 --> 14:31.918
- that time when you weren't here.
- Mm-hm.

14:32.087 --> 14:35.919
I don't care.
I don't want Marge in my house.

14:36.090 --> 14:39.092
You're not exactly
on my A list either, kook.

14:39.260 --> 14:41.929
Well, I can see where Libby
gets her meanness from.

14:42.096 --> 14:43.128
Exactly.

14:43.305 --> 14:45.594
And I believe that would be
another piece to the puzzle.

14:46.266 --> 14:49.517
Are you gonna cry?
Because I'll hang up.

14:49.686 --> 14:52.012
Oh, I was just reminding you
that we're--

14:52.188 --> 14:54.229
I'm still here.

14:54.399 --> 14:56.854
I'll just go get that book now.

15:00.154 --> 15:04.104
Told you that one
was the bathroom. Let's try this one.

15:07.243 --> 15:09.320
Yup, this is Libby's room, all right.

15:09.495 --> 15:12.331
- But where do we start?
- Check the last piece of the puzzle.

15:12.498 --> 15:14.907
Uh... "One of these things
is not like the other."

15:15.084 --> 15:16.993
<i>One of these things
Just doesn't belong</i>

15:17.169 --> 15:19.376
<i>Can you guess...?</i>

15:19.546 --> 15:23.248
At least
I'm not holding up the hourglass.

15:23.675 --> 15:27.259
Well, when it comes to photography,
Libby has really specific tastes.

15:27.429 --> 15:29.967
But what stands out?

15:30.139 --> 15:33.307
Look. This frame is purple.
All the others are gold.

15:33.476 --> 15:34.887
And there's something on the back.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.813
"Buy 20 gold frames,
get one purple frame free."

15:37.980 --> 15:41.230
- Yeah, now only ten minutes left.
- I know. But we can't panic.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.894
If we're gonna find the puzzle piece,

15:43.067 --> 15:45.108
we have to be
painstakingly methodical.

15:45.612 --> 15:49.148
I have a feeling Libby's gonna know
someone was in her room.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.356
You think?

15:51.408 --> 15:55.193
I swear, even as a puzzle,
Libby's getting on my nerves.

15:55.370 --> 15:57.198
Wait a minute.

15:57.372 --> 16:00.327
This one thing
is definitely not like the others.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.125
Looks like
we found a sweet grandmother.

16:02.293 --> 16:05.378
Look at the note. "Dear, dear Libby:
Sweet of you to take me to the ballet.

16:05.546 --> 16:08.501
Your birthday, it'll be you and me
on the roller coaster of your choice.

16:08.674 --> 16:10.051
Love, Grandma."

16:11.552 --> 16:13.711
This is it.
And there's nothing on the back.

16:13.887 --> 16:15.881
This has gotta be the last piece.
Let's go home.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.009
I'll zap us back.
We only have a few minutes left.

16:20.477 --> 16:22.934
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, no, the room.

16:25.815 --> 16:29.232
- Did you find that book?
- Just now.

16:29.401 --> 16:31.312
- And here it is.
- Good.

16:31.487 --> 16:34.904
Do you wanna stay and see Libby?
You can wait in the garage.

16:35.074 --> 16:38.443
- Don't do it. She'll turn on the car.
- No, thank you.

16:38.618 --> 16:41.371
Okay, but we're expecting her
any minute.

16:41.538 --> 16:44.077
Really? Then I better hurry.
I mean go.

16:49.503 --> 16:51.995
And this is the piece
that came out of her tutoring notebook.

16:53.298 --> 16:56.502
She must consider poor math skills
her Achilles' heel.

16:56.677 --> 16:58.337
This is the one
that came off her mother.

16:58.511 --> 17:00.801
Oh. That must be her cold shoulder.

17:00.972 --> 17:03.724
And this is the one that came
from her grandmother's picture.

17:03.891 --> 17:04.972
I know where this goes.

17:06.602 --> 17:07.979
Her heart.

17:08.146 --> 17:11.894
Oh, no, there's still a piece missing.
And time just ran out.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.473
Don't worry,
that piece doesn't exist yet.

17:14.651 --> 17:16.692
It's Libby's compassion for others.

17:16.862 --> 17:18.522
Now, you have to gradually
fill that space

17:18.696 --> 17:22.362
by showing compassion for Libby
even when she doesn't show it for you.

17:22.532 --> 17:25.239
In other words,
learn to work together.

17:25.411 --> 17:26.575
- I get it.
- Mm-hm.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.154
And by the way, could this lesson
be any more heavy-handed?

17:29.331 --> 17:33.199
Well, I could've been behind a pulpit.
See you.

17:39.674 --> 17:42.711
What is going on?
What am I doing here?

17:42.885 --> 17:44.795
Oh, you just came by
to see if I needed a ride.

17:44.970 --> 17:47.343
- I don't.
- I would not.

17:47.514 --> 17:48.974
I'm getting out of here.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.724
Uh, wait, Libby.

17:51.894 --> 17:53.970
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

17:54.145 --> 17:57.562
Once again, weirdness reigns
whenever "Safreakna's" around.

17:59.192 --> 18:03.142
Oh, yeah, sympathy for Libby.
Piece of cake.

18:06.031 --> 18:07.360
You know, Libby, I have to admit,

18:07.532 --> 18:09.822
your side of the float
is looking pretty good.

18:09.993 --> 18:12.319
I'm glad you're willing
to state the obvious.

18:12.496 --> 18:14.323
Oh, well, I...

18:14.790 --> 18:17.162
I'm going to accept that
as a compliment.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.827
Then you could use a dictionary.

18:24.632 --> 18:27.502
Libby, um, I could use some help
with my crepe paper.

18:27.675 --> 18:29.716
I have a box of matches.

18:30.845 --> 18:33.254
But it's just that I wanted to get done
this weekend

18:33.431 --> 18:35.472
so I could, uh, visit my grandma.

18:37.018 --> 18:38.596
Oh.

18:40.646 --> 18:45.937
Well, I would hate for part of the float
to look like you did it.

18:47.444 --> 18:50.979
- Okay, I'll help.
- Thanks.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.231
You know, Libby,
sometimes you're a real puzzle.

18:54.409 --> 18:55.572
No talking.

18:57.787 --> 18:59.615
Zelda, we have a problem.

18:59.789 --> 19:01.616
Come, now,
don't let the pressure get to you.

19:01.790 --> 19:04.827
A strong business
requires a strong stomach.

19:05.001 --> 19:06.201
I'm gonna be sick.

19:06.378 --> 19:08.870
It turns out your cleanser
is more versatile than we thought.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.753
It not only cleans,
it also turns people into mutants.

19:11.925 --> 19:14.250
Well, how do you know
that happens to everyone? What if--?

19:14.427 --> 19:16.337
- Gross.
- Help!

19:16.512 --> 19:17.544
Oh...

19:18.722 --> 19:21.345
People are demanding
their money back.

19:21.517 --> 19:25.894
And I already put a down payment
on a condo in Florida.

19:26.062 --> 19:28.020
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

19:28.189 --> 19:29.982
I'm not the one
who invented an allergy cure

19:30.150 --> 19:32.060
and then tried to pawn it off
as a cleanser.

19:32.235 --> 19:34.393
- I never should've--
- I cannot be held responsible--

19:34.570 --> 19:36.563
You corrupted me
with your supply-side economics.

19:36.739 --> 19:39.065
- You just--
- Hey! You guys.

19:39.533 --> 19:41.112
Why can't we learn to get along?

19:41.285 --> 19:43.113
Sabrina learned to get along
with Libby.

19:43.287 --> 19:44.830
You're right.

19:44.997 --> 19:47.914
- Thanks.
- I mean this with all of my love:

19:48.082 --> 19:50.290
Don't touch me.

20:01.845 --> 20:03.044
Libby, Sabrina,

20:03.221 --> 20:06.010
I just want to thank you both
for working together

20:06.183 --> 20:07.808
and doing such a good job.

20:07.975 --> 20:09.768
I love the way
you took two different themes

20:09.935 --> 20:11.596
and integrated them together.

20:11.771 --> 20:13.480
My idea.

20:15.191 --> 20:16.935
You don't have to let her
take the credit.

20:17.109 --> 20:18.735
I've met her mother.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.610
<i>Hey, Sabrina.
How's it going with Libby?</i>

20:24.157 --> 20:27.325
Well, I'm beginning to understand her,
yet I still wanna wring her neck.

20:27.494 --> 20:30.364
- It's the best of both worlds.
<i>- Cool.</i>

20:30.537 --> 20:32.946
<i>Say, do you mind
if I hang around for a bit?</i>

20:33.123 --> 20:35.662
<i>- I've never been on a float before.</i>
- Oh, that's sweet.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.413
And you just happen to be
in the middle

20:37.586 --> 20:39.995
of my "Agents of Destruction"
video game.

20:41.340 --> 20:45.420
<i>Oh, no. Fire in the hole!</i>

20:50.890 --> 20:52.883
Well, I have to admit,
you were right, Aunt Hilda.

20:53.058 --> 20:54.518
Jigsaw puzzles are really relaxing.

20:54.684 --> 20:57.936
It's the perfect way
to wile away a rainy afternoon.

20:58.105 --> 21:00.264
The fact that it's sunny
and unseasonably warm outside

21:00.440 --> 21:02.315
takes nothing away from the fun.

21:02.484 --> 21:05.271
You know, Sabrina, I don't think
I told you this, but in my opinion,

21:05.444 --> 21:07.817
your Democracy Daze float
was the best.

21:07.988 --> 21:09.947
Thanks. It did turn out great.

21:10.116 --> 21:12.821
It's going to stand as a monument
to your creative talent

21:12.993 --> 21:14.654
and democratic spirit.

21:14.829 --> 21:16.868
Not really.
When we got back to the school,

21:17.038 --> 21:18.866
the engine Harvey
had been working on blew up

21:19.040 --> 21:20.701
and the whole thing burned
to the ground.

21:20.875 --> 21:24.210
Ever reminding us
that democracy is a fragile thing.

21:24.379 --> 21:26.585
Just a few more pieces left.

21:26.755 --> 21:27.835
This puzzle's pretty easy,

21:28.006 --> 21:30.130
considering the subject
is so hard to live with.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.884
Hurry up and finish
my nose. I need to sneeze.
