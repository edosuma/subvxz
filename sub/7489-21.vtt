00:12.373 --> 00:15.193
Man, I love dogs.

00:15.208 --> 00:19.782
Uh Trish, there are no
dogs on those leashes.

00:19.783 --> 00:23.617
Is it that obvious? Do you
think my boss would notice?

00:23.618 --> 00:26.209
Yeah, you're probably
gonna get fired.

00:26.210 --> 00:29.568
Good. My boss is so demanding.

00:29.569 --> 00:33.382
Show up on time, feed the
dogs, don't lose the dogs.

00:33.383 --> 00:36.018
No one's that good
of an employee.

00:36.019 --> 00:37.317

00:37.318 --> 00:40.089
What up? What up?

00:40.090 --> 00:42.003
Whoa, cool ride.

00:42.004 --> 00:44.160
Austin got it for me.

00:44.161 --> 00:50.061
It's got a chrome grill in the front
and a charcoal grill in the back.

00:50.652 --> 00:52.692
Burger?

00:54.004 --> 00:56.438
Wow, Austin, that's a really
nice gift you got Dez.

00:56.439 --> 00:57.922
I bought gifts for everybody.

00:57.923 --> 01:01.043

01:01.044 --> 01:02.178
How exciting.

01:09.523 --> 01:13.289
- You're gonna be your own boss.
- Finally, a boss that won't fire me.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.391
Thanks, Austin.

01:15.392 --> 01:17.326
That's so thoughtful, Austin.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.671
I hate when people just
think about themselves.

01:19.672 --> 01:24.052
What'd you get me?
What'd you get me?

01:26.303 --> 01:27.657
Oh.

01:27.658 --> 01:30.106

01:30.107 --> 01:32.074

01:32.075 --> 01:35.211
Yep! Just like Princess Crystal

01:38.148 --> 01:40.459

Oh.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.203
Uh, I don't think you're supposed to
wear them, they're just for show.

01:46.204 --> 01:48.283
You can barely walk in them.

02:05.815 --> 02:08.717
Austin, I love the gifts.

02:08.719 --> 02:13.149
But as your manager, I think spending money
on things you don't need is a bad idea.

02:13.150 --> 02:15.989
- You should save up for a rainy day.
- I am.

02:15.990 --> 02:21.270

money from his guitar case
when he wasn't looking.

05:30.753 --> 05:34.431
- We should go after her.
- I can't chase her with you on my back.

05:34.432 --> 05:36.592
Why don't you take
off your shoes?

05:36.593 --> 05:39.395

I don't have one.

11:39.607 --> 11:43.610
Look, I'm planning a big concert, so I'm
not gonna have time to babysit you.

11:43.611 --> 11:46.375
I've only got one
important question.

11:46.376 --> 11:48.823
What is your name?

11:48.824 --> 11:52.184
- Bonnie.
- You're hired.

11:57.791 --> 12:01.401
I think these fit us
better when we were nine.

12:01.402 --> 12:02.580
What?

12:02.581 --> 12:06.181
I just bought this yesterday.

12:07.768 --> 12:12.508
All right, Jackson.
Let's see how you look.

12:12.740 --> 12:15.316

never thought I'd think again.</i>

12:50.948 --> 12:54.908
<i>♪ And I think I know you will...</i>

13:01.340 --> 13:04.558
Good news. I booked a club
for Austin's concert.

13:04.559 --> 13:06.859
And I spread the word that
Jackson's performing with him.

13:06.860 --> 13:08.728
That's great.

13:08.729 --> 13:12.012
Wait, how were you able to do
all of that and run your kiosk?

13:12.013 --> 13:15.668
I hired my first employee.
I love being a boss.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.116
You never have to work.

13:18.117 --> 13:20.497
- How's the new song coming?
- I'm almost done.

13:20.498 --> 13:24.744
The store's been empty except for that
girl over there reading the magazines.

13:24.745 --> 13:26.845
Bonnie?!

13:27.648 --> 13:31.018
- Oh, hey, Trish.
- What are you doing here?

13:31.019 --> 13:33.653
Mm, I'm on my break.

13:33.654 --> 13:36.556
Break? You just
started an hour ago.

13:36.557 --> 13:40.037
Hmm, remind you of anybody?

13:40.378 --> 13:43.325
What kind of employee
pulls this kind of stunt?

13:43.326 --> 13:46.326
I can think of one.

13:47.435 --> 13:50.031
You're gonna work extra late
tonight to make up for lost time.

13:50.032 --> 13:52.091
Oh, I can't.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.334
I was gonna watch TV tonight.

13:54.335 --> 13:56.087
Get back to work.

13:56.088 --> 13:58.308
Oh! Fine.

13:59.862 --> 14:02.562
Can you believe that girl?

14:02.563 --> 14:06.163
Guess who she reminds me of?

14:06.272 --> 14:10.292
Ally, I'm not a mind reader.
Who?

14:15.563 --> 14:18.232
Wow. Look at all these
people here to see Jackson.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.699
His fans still love him.

14:19.700 --> 14:22.934
They're gonna love him even more after
you guys sing the song I wrote.

14:22.935 --> 14:24.153
It rocks.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.914
<i>♪ Rock and roll!</i>

14:27.309 --> 14:30.129
Nice scream, Ally.

14:30.653 --> 14:32.625
Guys, we got a huge problem.

14:32.626 --> 14:34.392
Jackson just left.

14:34.393 --> 14:37.067
What are we gonna do? The
show's about to start.

14:37.068 --> 14:38.685
He walked out on us?

14:38.686 --> 14:41.582
After all that time and
money we spent on him.

14:41.583 --> 14:44.791
I can't believe that jerk.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.826
Jackson Lowe is a legend.

14:46.827 --> 14:48.695
You do not call him a jerk!

14:48.696 --> 14:52.716
- He stole your cart.
- That jerk!

15:05.589 --> 15:08.003
Jackson, what happened?

15:08.004 --> 15:12.138
Sorry, kid. I haven't
performed onstage in years.

15:12.139 --> 15:16.724
What if I forget the words, or I can't
hit the high notes, or even worse...

15:16.725 --> 15:20.915
I split these new leather pants. I
paid good money for these things.

15:20.916 --> 15:24.559
- I bought them for you.
- Oh yeah, thanks.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.565
You've got nothing
to worry about.

15:27.566 --> 15:30.311
Let me tell you something.
I had a great year.

15:30.312 --> 15:34.153
I had a hit record, I played Times
Square in front of a million people...

15:34.154 --> 15:37.186
Way to rub it in, man.

15:37.187 --> 15:40.698
No. That's not why I'm
telling you all this.

15:40.699 --> 15:44.286
None of that would have
been possible without you.

15:44.287 --> 15:47.563
You've always been my
biggest inspiration.

15:47.564 --> 15:49.010
Do you want to hear a secret?

15:49.011 --> 15:51.171
You still sleep
with a night-light.

15:51.172 --> 15:54.220
- How do you know that?
- My limo driver talks a lot.

15:54.221 --> 15:57.280
I use a night-light
to read in bed.

15:57.281 --> 15:59.408
Not because I'm afraid
of pillow monsters.

15:59.409 --> 16:01.105
Nobody mentioned
pillow monsters.

16:01.106 --> 16:03.686
Neither did I.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.582
Anyway, my secret is that...

16:06.583 --> 16:09.417
If I'm feeling a lot of
pressure before a big show,

16:09.418 --> 16:12.948
I go on stage and I
pretend I'm you.

16:12.949 --> 16:15.162
You're the coolest
performer I know.

16:15.163 --> 16:17.727
The guy that can do anything.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.295
Wow.

16:19.296 --> 16:21.289
That means a lot, kid.

16:21.290 --> 16:24.285
And I hear what you're saying.

16:24.286 --> 16:30.186
You want me to go on stage pretending
to be you pretending to be me.

16:31.051 --> 16:33.584
Or you could just
pretend to be yourself?

16:33.585 --> 16:36.722
I like my way. Let's do this.

16:36.723 --> 16:39.043
Oh, there you are!

16:39.044 --> 16:42.318
I was so worried about you.

16:42.319 --> 16:44.420
I can't believe you
stole my ride.

16:47.224 --> 16:50.035

anyone their money back.

17:23.393 --> 17:24.994
This is ridiculous.

17:24.996 --> 17:27.215
I know. These people
are getting restless.

17:27.217 --> 17:29.565
No. Bonnie's here.

17:29.566 --> 17:31.771
She's supposed to be working.

17:31.772 --> 17:33.087
She's the worst.

17:33.088 --> 17:38.653
She's rude, she takes long breaks,
she's never on time, she...

17:38.654 --> 17:41.414
Is just like me.

17:41.612 --> 17:44.852
Really? I never noticed.

17:46.283 --> 17:48.245
- Hey, Trish.
- What are you doing here?

17:48.246 --> 17:49.940
Oh, I came to see the concert.

17:49.941 --> 17:51.454
You called in sick.

17:51.455 --> 17:53.254
Oh yeah.

17:53.255 --> 17:55.666
I came to see the concert.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.629
That's it. You're fired.

17:57.630 --> 17:59.228
I knew you didn't like me.

17:59.229 --> 18:00.927
No, I do.

18:00.928 --> 18:04.328
But we're just so much alike,
and I'd never hire myself.

18:04.329 --> 18:06.435
I'm a terrible employee.

18:06.436 --> 18:08.341
Me too!

18:08.342 --> 18:10.104
You can't work for me.

18:10.105 --> 18:12.408
But maybe we can go to
the movies or something?

18:12.409 --> 18:14.109
That would be great.

18:14.110 --> 18:18.310
Unless we're both
"working" that day.

18:19.251 --> 18:21.291
