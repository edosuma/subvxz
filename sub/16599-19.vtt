22-year-old male.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.238
GSWs to the posterior
neck and lower abdomen.

00:06.273 --> 00:08.507
BP's 90/60,
pulse is 91.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.410
Page Walsh.
Get him down here. Go!

00:11.445 --> 00:12.578
On it.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.714
Tanya?

00:15.749 --> 00:17.449
Tanya Morrison?

00:19.586 --> 00:21.587
Let's go. Come on.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.594
NURSE:
<i>Can you show me where it hurts?</i>

00:29.629 --> 00:31.463
Here.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.299
Sorry.

00:34.334 --> 00:37.102
I'm just gonna listen
to your lungs now, okay?

00:38.672 --> 00:40.606
That's interesting.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.810
Take some deep breaths
for me, please.

00:46.446 --> 00:47.813
(winces)

00:49.449 --> 00:51.083
Does it hurt more
when you breathe in,

00:51.118 --> 00:53.085
or when you breathe out,
or about the same?

00:53.120 --> 00:54.086
Same.

00:54.121 --> 00:55.320
And when did
the pain start?

00:55.355 --> 00:58.356
Uh, I... uh...

00:58.391 --> 01:00.358
Right after she fell.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.259
She fell?

01:01.294 --> 01:03.095
Yeah, at our house.

01:03.130 --> 01:03.795
How'd you fall,
honey?

01:03.830 --> 01:04.696
Um...

01:04.731 --> 01:05.563
EMILIO: Coming down
the stairs, right?

01:05.599 --> 01:09.334
She was going too fast,
missed a step.

01:09.369 --> 01:11.103
Is that right?
You tripped?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.239
Yeah.

01:15.175 --> 01:16.675
Is this gonna
take long?

01:16.710 --> 01:19.411
Well, I'm pretty sure
they're broken,

01:19.446 --> 01:21.113
but we'll need some X-rays first

01:21.148 --> 01:22.414
to make sure.

01:22.449 --> 01:23.882
Tell you what, why
don't you head back

01:23.917 --> 01:26.284
to the waiting area or
go get a cup of coffee,

01:26.319 --> 01:28.687
and I'll come get you...
It's all right. I'll stay.

01:28.722 --> 01:29.488
All right.

01:30.690 --> 01:31.656
Okay.
- Be right back.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.658
All right.

01:33.693 --> 01:35.560
(door closes)

01:35.595 --> 01:36.895
Hey.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.231
I need you to notify
Family Services.

01:39.266 --> 01:42.567
I think the girl
in Exam 3's been abused.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.370
This is Kailani in E.R.
I need Family...

01:51.611 --> 01:55.380
Jan, the girl who was just back
here, you see where she went?

01:55.415 --> 01:56.582
Sorry.

02:09.896 --> 02:10.829
Hey!

02:12.699 --> 02:14.433
(siren wailing)

02:15.435 --> 02:17.202
Get in!

02:17.237 --> 02:18.203
(engine starts)

02:18.238 --> 02:19.271
Hey!

02:19.306 --> 02:20.639
(tires screech)

02:20.674 --> 02:22.141
Wait!

02:23.877 --> 02:27.379
<i>(Hawaii Five-O</i>

02:56.910 --> 02:59.778
STEVE:<i> So I got a phone call</i>
<i>from the director</i>

02:59.813 --> 03:00.779
of the Phoenix Foundation.
Thanks.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.582
She told me that you guys
did a hell of a job.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.651
Ah. Well, it was a team effort.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.620
Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.722
You know your friend Jack--
he's a lot like you, huh?

03:10.757 --> 03:12.791
I'm don't know if that's a compliment.
(laughs)

03:12.826 --> 03:13.892
I'll just leave it at that.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.794
Okay.

03:15.829 --> 03:19.264
So, I know you didn't invite me
over to pat me on the back.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.065
So what's up?

03:20.100 --> 03:21.967
Oh, I just wanted
to check on you.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.268
See how Adam's doing.

03:24.304 --> 03:27.973
Oh, yeah, he's, um, he's good.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.808
Yeah, he's hanging in there.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.777
I heard he's, uh, having
some troubles finding a job

03:32.812 --> 03:34.312
since he got out,
is that right?

03:34.347 --> 03:36.682
Yeah, that part hasn't
been easy, that's for sure.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.952
Yeah, anything, uh, that he did
before he went to prison,

03:40.987 --> 03:42.086
all the successes,

03:42.122 --> 03:44.623
they don't count for anything
once you have a record.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.358
And also,

03:47.393 --> 03:49.894
if we want to start
having a family,

03:49.929 --> 03:51.730
he wants to know that
he can do his part, right?

03:51.765 --> 03:52.998
Right.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.634
I just want you guys
to know, both of you,

03:55.669 --> 03:56.801
if you need anything...

03:56.836 --> 03:58.003
I know.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.304
(doorbell rings)
Yeah.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.006
Hey, excuse me for a second.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.343
Hi.

04:05.378 --> 04:06.544
Good morning, sir.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.813
I'm Sara Diaz,
I'm seven years old,

04:08.848 --> 04:11.016
and I am selling
the most delicious cookies

04:11.051 --> 04:13.285
for Aloha Girls
Troop 1138.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.919
Would you like to buy some?

04:14.954 --> 04:17.289
(whispers):
Don't forget to smile.

04:17.324 --> 04:19.291
Yes, I would like to buy some.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.392
Please come in.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.562
SARA:
We have...

04:24.597 --> 04:26.564
Caramel S'mores...
- Mm-hmm.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.533
Chocolate Mint Wafers...

04:28.568 --> 04:30.035
Mm-hmm.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.070
...Coconut Oatmeal,

04:32.105 --> 04:34.372
and my favorite,
Hawaiian Shortbread.

04:34.407 --> 04:35.406
That's my favorite, too.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.043
I'll take four boxes,
one of each flavor, please.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.878
You're doing good,
little one.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.446
Now hit him
with the look.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.317
What's the matter?

04:45.352 --> 04:48.320
If my troop doesn't sell
500 boxes,

04:48.355 --> 04:51.756
we won't be able to afford
our gymnastics equipment.

04:51.791 --> 04:52.991
500 boxes?
That's a lot of cookies.

04:53.993 --> 04:55.393
I better take eight boxes.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.696
Detective Williams
bought 12.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.998
Detective Williams is
in Jersey visiting his sister.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.966
How'd he buy 12 boxes of cookies?
(phone ringing)

05:02.001 --> 05:04.069
Bruddah put his order
in before he left.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.104
That true?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.506
Well, I'll buy 13.
How about that?

05:08.541 --> 05:10.575
13 boxes, please.

05:11.077 --> 05:11.843
You were right.

05:11.878 --> 05:14.313
I told you
they were competitive.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.682
This is Kono.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.453
Good. Three, five,
that's six.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.955
Hey, you know what?
You're lucky Auntie Kono's here.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.857
She's good for
at least a dozen boxes.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.026
Hey, hey, actually, I already bought mine.
- Yeah?

05:28.061 --> 05:30.695
You know what? I am loving
those Caramel S'mores.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.130
They're my number one seller.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.666
KONO:
I bet. Good work.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.735
Hey, so, I just got a call
from Noelani.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.036
She wants me to go visit her.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.070
Okay.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.705
Is everything all right?

05:40.740 --> 05:42.574
Yeah, she's fine, she just needs
some help with something.

05:42.609 --> 05:43.708
I'll, uh, fill you in later.

05:43.743 --> 05:44.709
Okay.

05:44.744 --> 05:45.844
KONO:
Love those cookies.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.713
<i>Hey, Noelani.</i>

05:48.748 --> 05:50.382
I really appreciate
this, Officer Kalakaua.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.051
I know Five-O doesn't usually
handle matters like this.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.153
So how do you and this
nurse know each other?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.921
We went to
Oahu State together.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.156
After graduation,
I went to med school,

05:58.191 --> 06:00.058
and Anna went
into nursing.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.794
Anna, this is Officer Kalakaua
from the Five-O Task Force.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.129
Thank you for coming.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.131
Yeah, Noelani filled me in.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.932
So the girl
came here last night?

06:07.967 --> 06:08.833
Yeah.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.436
The guy she was with
said he was her uncle.

06:11.471 --> 06:12.871
I left them alone
for a minute, came back,

06:12.906 --> 06:14.105
and they were gone.
Do you, by chance,

06:14.140 --> 06:15.774
have the paperwork
that they filled out

06:15.809 --> 06:17.809
when they were checked in?
Yeah.

06:21.581 --> 06:24.449
Did she have any other
noticeable bruises?

06:24.484 --> 06:26.718
None that I could see,
but I didn't get the chance

06:26.753 --> 06:27.952
to give her
a thorough exam.

06:27.987 --> 06:29.521
I know how
this might sound,

06:29.556 --> 06:31.556
but I've seen this
kind of thing before.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.894
Okay, where's your
security office?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.762
I'm gonna need to see
all closed-circuit footage

06:37.797 --> 06:38.797
that they might have.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.445
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

06:53.480 --> 06:55.947
So I ran the names that Tanya
and her uncle gave the hospital.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.449
Nothing came back on
either one of them,

06:57.484 --> 06:59.451
but the contact info
they left was fake,

06:59.486 --> 07:01.553
so I'm thinking that
their names were, too.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.122
Is there any chance
that Nurse Anna got a plate

07:04.157 --> 07:05.457
from the car they left in?

07:05.492 --> 07:07.091
Unfortunately not.

07:07.126 --> 07:08.626
JERRY:
Oh, good timing.

07:08.661 --> 07:09.994
Hospital sent over
the security footage.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.897
I was about to run
facial rec on the uncle.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.699
Won't be surprised if
he's in the system.

07:14.734 --> 07:15.834
Why do you say that?

07:15.869 --> 07:18.203
The way she's sitting.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.472
I think she's
afraid of him.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.877
I see Sara worked her
magic spell on you, too, huh?

07:25.912 --> 07:26.744
Oh, I can't.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.246
Please, you got to
help me eat these.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.047
Thanks,

07:29.082 --> 07:30.482
but I'm a Chocolate
Mint Wafer man.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.183
Got two boxes in the freezer.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.651
Oh.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.553
I guess I was wrong.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.056
Do me a favor, Jerry,
run facial rec on the girl.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.927
What are you thinking?
I don't know, got a hunch.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.498
What do you know.

07:46.533 --> 07:49.033
Moani Amosa. Age 15.

07:49.068 --> 07:51.769
Disappeared six weeks ago.
Believed to be a runaway.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.239
Okay, so who's this
guy she was with?

07:54.274 --> 07:55.940
Could be her kidnapper.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.209
Maybe, but what kind of
a kidnapper

07:58.244 --> 07:59.244
brings his victim to the E.R.?

08:09.889 --> 08:11.990
Do you recognize this man?

08:12.025 --> 08:14.259
No. I mean,
who is he?

08:14.294 --> 08:15.126
We don't know.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.694
But he was spotted
with your daughter

08:16.729 --> 08:18.029
at King's Medical last night.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.631
The nurse who was treating her

08:19.666 --> 08:21.966
thinks that she may
have broken some ribs

08:22.001 --> 08:23.268
and she suspects
that this man

08:23.303 --> 08:25.637
may be responsible.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.738
I don't understand.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.273
Why didn't Moani
say anything to anyone?

08:28.308 --> 08:30.642
Well, it's possible
she was scared.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.613
Does your daughter have
her own laptop or computer?

08:35.648 --> 08:38.717
She has a laptop, but, I mean,
the police already checked it.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.586
We'd like to have another look.

08:45.224 --> 08:46.991
GROVER:<i> So I heard about</i>
<i>your run-in on the Big Island.</i>

08:47.026 --> 08:49.627
You and Kono back in
one piece, that's good.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.963
Yeah, thanks to a little
help from some guys

08:51.998 --> 08:53.331
from the mainland.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.567
Jack Dalton and
Angus MacGyver.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.168
Yeah, those guys
were something else.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.703
Angus?

08:58.738 --> 09:00.004
Like beef?
- (chuckles)

09:00.039 --> 09:02.273
That's an interesting name.
Trust me when I tell you

09:02.308 --> 09:03.808
that's the least interesting
thing about him.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.643
I got three bodies inside.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.046
House is a sober
living home.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.280
All three vics
are male.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.850
Two were recovering addicts,
the third was a drug counselor.

09:13.753 --> 09:14.719
Doesn't look
like a robbery.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.854
Two of the guys still
have their watches on.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.189
There's a laptop
and a TV

09:18.224 --> 09:19.724
in plain sight.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.826
Who found the bodies?
Girlfriend of one of the vics.

09:21.861 --> 09:24.763
Stacy Holden's her name.
She's outside.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.700
STACY:
<i>I stopped by this morning</i>

09:28.735 --> 09:31.836
with coffee and donuts.

09:31.871 --> 09:34.238
Todd wasn't exactly having the
easiest time with his recovery,

09:34.273 --> 09:36.207
so I try to stop by once a day.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.275
Mm.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.077
Stacy,

09:39.112 --> 09:41.779
can you think of anyone
who might want to hurt Todd

09:41.814 --> 09:44.682
or these other
two men?

09:44.717 --> 09:47.151
It may be nothing, but...

09:47.186 --> 09:50.088
a few times that I was here,
a couple of guys came by.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.789
They didn't say much.

09:51.824 --> 09:53.191
They just went
and talked to Mark,

09:53.226 --> 09:55.226
uh, the counselor here.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.161
They never stayed long.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.397
Ten minutes, tops.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.266
And Mark said that
they were recovering addicts

10:02.301 --> 10:05.703
and that he was trying
to help them, but...

10:05.738 --> 10:06.938
But you didn't think so.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.272
(voice breaking):
They didn't seem like

10:08.307 --> 10:09.707
former users.

10:09.742 --> 10:12.810
I mean, trust me,
I am one myself.

10:12.845 --> 10:15.246
All I can tell
you guys is that

10:15.281 --> 10:17.849
they looked like trouble.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.817
And now he's gone.

10:19.852 --> 10:21.820
Excuse me.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.729
Hey, Sanoe, answer me this.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.264
Don't you think

10:33.299 --> 10:36.000
it's a little unusual
to have four dehumidifiers

10:36.035 --> 10:38.903
in a little bitty
room like this?

10:38.938 --> 10:41.840
Yeah, now that you mention it,
it is a little weird.

10:42.942 --> 10:44.776
Someone obviously wanted
the air in this room

10:44.811 --> 10:46.277
to be as dry
as possible.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.312
Huh.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.182
Huh.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.100
You got something, Lou?

11:09.135 --> 11:10.802
Yes, I do.

11:10.837 --> 11:14.072
We got four dehumidifying
units in this room,

11:14.107 --> 11:16.808
secret compartment
in the wall here,

11:16.843 --> 11:18.076
and moisture-absorbing
packets inside.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.778
Add that up with what
Stacy just told us,

11:20.813 --> 11:22.714
and this place is
a hell of a lot more

11:22.749 --> 11:23.881
than just a sober
living house.

11:23.916 --> 11:24.982
A stash house.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.086
Yeah, the two shady types
Stacy was taking about,

11:28.121 --> 11:30.221
they got to be dealers;
this was a robbery.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.028
ERIC:
Officer Kalakaua.

11:37.063 --> 11:38.863
Aloha and salutations.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.231
What brings you to my lab?

11:40.266 --> 11:41.766
That's a little formal,
isn't it?

11:41.801 --> 11:43.034
Yeah, well,

11:43.069 --> 11:44.736
Uncle D says
he'll drop a dime on me

11:44.771 --> 11:46.804
with HR if I say,
"Yo, what up," one more time.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.740
Oh, I believe it was,
"Yo, what up, honey cheeks."

11:48.775 --> 11:50.908
I don't always say it like that.

11:50.943 --> 11:52.977
But, yeah,
I'm on verbal lockdown.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.412
So how can I help you today?

11:54.447 --> 11:55.313
I need a favor.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.848
Ah, hit me.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.316
Hey, hey, wait,
let me guess.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.751
Did you forget
your password again?

11:59.786 --> 12:01.385
This actually belonged
to a 15-year-old girl

12:01.420 --> 12:02.887
that went missing
six weeks ago.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.889
Oh. Sorry.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.358
So, we think that she might
have run away; we're hoping

12:07.393 --> 12:09.360
that there's something on there
that might give us some leads.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.762
Sounds serious. I'm on it.

12:10.797 --> 12:11.796
Yeah, all right, thanks.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.364
Hey, hey,
wait, wait, wait.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.366
You seem like a Caramel S'mores
type of woman.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.802
You might be right, but
Sara's already hooked me up.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.137
I am fully stocked.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.740
Man, kid's good
at slinging sugar.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.997
I know you?

12:46.032 --> 12:48.866
No, we've not been
formally introduced.

12:48.901 --> 12:52.103
You see, Five-O has
a new outreach program

12:52.138 --> 12:54.238
where we try
to introduce ourselves

12:54.273 --> 12:56.574
to all of the local drug dealers
on the island.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.809
So...

12:57.844 --> 12:58.510
how you doin'?

12:58.545 --> 12:59.577
How'd you know where to find me?

12:59.612 --> 13:00.978
Oh, it wasn't
too difficult,

13:01.013 --> 13:02.146
considering your son

13:02.181 --> 13:05.183
posted a picture of you two
on Instagram a half hour ago.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.951
Outed by social media.

13:06.986 --> 13:09.153
You're a very busy man,
clearly,

13:09.188 --> 13:10.287
so we'll get right to the point.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.590
We know it was your stash house
that was hit in Kapolei

13:12.625 --> 13:15.026
this morning; we know this
because you're the guy

13:15.061 --> 13:16.894
that's been paying the
electricity bills on the place.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.362
By the way, Makoa,

13:18.397 --> 13:21.800
sober living house
doubling as a stash house?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.368
Well done, my man.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.304
It's the
perfect cover.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.573
Will you be making this point
of yours anytime soon?

13:28.608 --> 13:29.974
We don't care
that you stashed

13:30.009 --> 13:31.576
your inventory at Clear Path.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.744
At least, not for today.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.913
But what we do care about
is catching whoever gunned down

13:35.948 --> 13:38.850
three innocent people
in pursuit of that inventory.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.418
So, who ripped you off, Makoa?

13:40.453 --> 13:42.887
What makes you think I know?

13:42.922 --> 13:44.188
Oh, come on.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.489
You're a smart guy.

13:45.524 --> 13:46.924
A criminal mastermind
like yourself,

13:46.959 --> 13:48.559
you must have
some kind of a theory.

13:48.594 --> 13:51.062
How about a rival gang
or something?

13:51.097 --> 13:53.497
I got no idea who did this.

13:53.532 --> 13:54.899
And we don't believe you.

13:54.934 --> 13:57.301
So, you can either
give us a name

13:57.336 --> 14:01.305
or we will bust that ass
right now for using Clear Path

14:01.340 --> 14:02.406
as a stash house.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.108
I'll beat that, and you know it.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.309
You know, you might.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.178
But we'll make sure
the prosecuting attorney

14:07.213 --> 14:09.914
takes it all the way to trial;
and by that time,

14:09.949 --> 14:11.282
the damage
will be done.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.583
You'll be
radioactive.

14:12.618 --> 14:13.985
And then, good luck

14:14.020 --> 14:15.653
trying to make a move
anywhere on this island.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.322
You're gonna have to pack up
your tent and go somewhere else.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.992
Or...

14:21.027 --> 14:22.326
give us a name.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.428
Then you can go back
to filming your kid

14:24.463 --> 14:26.231
doing his triple lutzes
or whatever it is.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.436
I managed to recover
a bunch of deleted messages

14:32.471 --> 14:34.105
off of Moani's hard drive.
Before she went missing,

14:34.140 --> 14:35.106
she was in contact

14:35.141 --> 14:36.607
with some dude named Jonah.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.243
Think he could be the guy
you're looking for.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.111
Okay, so how
did they connect?

14:40.146 --> 14:41.079
Social media.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.047
Looks like he has
a couple fake user profiles.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.282
They started DM-ing
each other.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.917
He paid her some
compliments. Eventually,

14:45.952 --> 14:46.985
she sent him a picture.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.320
After that,
they had plans

14:49.355 --> 14:50.454
to meet at the Waikele Outlets.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.288
All right,

14:51.323 --> 14:52.657
did we manage to get
this guy Jonah's

14:52.692 --> 14:54.525
IP address?
Not exactly.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.160
But I was able

14:56.195 --> 14:57.461
to approximate
his physical location.

14:57.496 --> 14:58.996
I think he's at a house

14:59.031 --> 15:01.632
in Waimanalo:
4128 Poalima.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.968
Property records indicate the
place has been in foreclosure

15:04.003 --> 15:04.902
the last four months,

15:04.938 --> 15:07.472
so I'd say
he was probably squatting there.

15:10.109 --> 15:11.642
STEVE:
<i>I don't get it.</i>

15:11.677 --> 15:13.644
It doesn't make sense
to me. Moani...

15:13.679 --> 15:16.013
seems like a bright kid
from a stable home.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.549
Yeah, yeah.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.986
But you know, 15,
it's a rough age for a girl.

15:22.021 --> 15:25.156
I mean,
you're awkward and insecure.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.991
You don't think
you're smart enough,

15:27.026 --> 15:28.326
pretty enough or popular enough.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.662
And then, suddenly someone
pays some attention to you.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.164
Sends you
a nice message

15:33.199 --> 15:35.066
or some compliments.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.669
Suddenly you feel like
somebody gets you.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.705
Like they care.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.308
Whoever this Jonah guy was,

15:44.343 --> 15:46.978
obviously understood that
and used it to his advantage.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.100
Move.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.171
KONO:
Move.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.467
On me.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.609
STEVE:
Move.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.450
(lock smashes)

17:01.720 --> 17:04.121
(gasps, whimpers)

17:04.156 --> 17:05.823
KONO: Hey, we're--
we're the police.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.092
It's okay.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.226
Hey,

17:09.261 --> 17:10.227
it's all right.

17:10.262 --> 17:11.495
It's all right.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.230
We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

17:13.265 --> 17:15.166
(girl whimpers) We're gonna
get you out of here.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.500
It's all right.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.701
I'm gonna take
your gag off, okay?

17:17.736 --> 17:19.103
It's okay.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.740
We came here to get you.
We're gonna get you out of here.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.341
(whimpers)
You're coming out.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.310
(sobs)

17:28.514 --> 17:30.548
It's okay.
(sobbing continues)

17:32.751 --> 17:34.519
It's okay.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.795
How is she?

17:44.830 --> 17:46.230
She's malnourished

17:46.265 --> 17:47.331
and dehydrated.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.733
Numerous instances of physical
and sexual assault.

17:49.768 --> 17:52.336
I saw similar trauma on the girl
who was brought in last night.

17:52.371 --> 17:53.337
All right.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.106
Can we talk to
her, please?

17:55.141 --> 17:56.240
This girl has been

17:56.276 --> 17:59.176
sex-trafficked for the past
four months, Commander.

17:59.211 --> 18:00.344
She's traumatized.

18:00.379 --> 18:01.745
STEVE:
I'm sorry,

18:01.780 --> 18:04.181
you said trafficked?
What-- what do you mean?

18:04.216 --> 18:05.583
She's a local girl.
- Yeah.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.718
Grew up in Manoa Valley.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.355
We understand
that she's been traumatized.

18:11.390 --> 18:13.891
But for all we know,
the man that we're after,

18:13.926 --> 18:15.426
he still has Moani.

18:15.461 --> 18:16.527
And if he's a trafficker,

18:16.562 --> 18:18.429
then there are other girls, too.
Who knows how many?

18:19.465 --> 18:21.298
Okay.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.234
But I think it would be better

18:23.269 --> 18:25.269
if Officer Kalakaua
went in alone.

18:25.304 --> 18:26.904
STEVE:
Yes, of course,

18:26.939 --> 18:28.306
I understand.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.425
Kelsey?

18:49.361 --> 18:51.362
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.364
If that's okay
with you.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.338
I know how hard
this must be.

19:01.373 --> 19:02.540
No, you don't.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.243
You're right.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.346
I don't.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.251
But...
I need your help right now.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.454
And so does Moani.

19:18.524 --> 19:19.924
You know her, right?

19:26.432 --> 19:27.965
How do you feel about

19:28.000 --> 19:30.734
getting outside this room
for a few minutes?

19:30.769 --> 19:33.404
Just for a little bit.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.378
Emilio.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.714
When was the last time
you saw him?

19:45.718 --> 19:48.553
At the house,
last night.

19:51.590 --> 19:55.426
Besides Moani, are
there other girls?

19:58.397 --> 20:00.398
There's three.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.735
Do you know where
they are right now?

20:08.741 --> 20:11.942
I just know
they took off.

20:11.977 --> 20:14.545
I'm not sure why.

20:14.580 --> 20:18.515
I overheard Tori saying
that Emilio wasn't coming back,

20:18.550 --> 20:21.285
so they all
had to leave.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.521
Tori-- is that
one of the other girls?

20:25.591 --> 20:27.458
No, she...

20:29.995 --> 20:33.431
I don't know,
keeps us in line, I guess.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.899
She's the one
who locked me

20:35.934 --> 20:36.967
in the closet.

20:37.002 --> 20:39.503
Why would she do that?

20:39.538 --> 20:41.572
Said I was mouthing off.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.441
Okay.

20:44.476 --> 20:47.578
Can you tell me
how you met?

20:47.613 --> 20:49.313
You and Emilio.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.785
I was at the mall.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.988
And he came up to me.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.791
Said I should be a model.

21:00.826 --> 21:04.495
Said if I wanted,
he could take some pictures.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.699
After that, I...

21:08.734 --> 21:11.602
started going over
to his place.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.037
You know,
just to hang.

21:19.345 --> 21:22.446
But then,

21:22.481 --> 21:23.614
pretty soon he's...

21:25.884 --> 21:28.486
he's pressuring me
to have sex.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.358
He said he loved me.

21:35.394 --> 21:38.796
And I believed him.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.365
Even after he started bringing
his friends around.

21:44.103 --> 21:47.438
They'd pay him after.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.639
(sniffles)

21:48.674 --> 21:52.510
He said he was saving it so that
we could go away together.

21:57.082 --> 22:00.618
Did you try to leave?

22:03.522 --> 22:08.525
I said I wanted
to go home, but...

22:08.560 --> 22:11.995
he said if I did,

22:12.030 --> 22:15.566
he'd go after my little sister.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.771
And do to her
what he was doing to me.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.613
(sniffling)

22:31.617 --> 22:33.550
(exhales)

22:33.585 --> 22:38.556
After that, he...
he put me with the other girls.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.926
We get moved around a lot.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.563
Different houses, but...

22:46.598 --> 22:49.700
the guys just keeping coming by.

22:50.803 --> 22:54.972
Were they... all
friends of his?

22:56.775 --> 22:59.143
Most of them were tourists.

22:59.178 --> 23:02.546
A few locals.

23:02.581 --> 23:06.884
Sometimes, we go to hotels.

23:06.919 --> 23:11.188
If we don't let them do
what they want,

23:11.223 --> 23:13.724
Emilio would hurt us.

23:17.162 --> 23:21.799
Did you... call my parents?

23:23.101 --> 23:25.169
They're on their way.

23:29.708 --> 23:34.612
Please... Please don't tell
my dad what they did to me.

23:36.014 --> 23:37.715
I really don't want him to know.

I ain't got time for this.

Get back in your car

Hey.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.751
You okay?

25:20.786 --> 25:22.786
Yeah.

25:34.132 --> 25:36.767
I talked to Kelsey.

25:36.802 --> 25:39.736
Think we might have a lead.

25:39.771 --> 25:43.040
She told me about
one of her regulars.

25:43.075 --> 25:46.243
She's, uh... she doesn't
know his real name,

25:46.278 --> 25:47.711
but he's a high school teacher.

25:47.746 --> 25:49.246
Coaches swim.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.583
You reach out to HPD?

25:52.618 --> 25:54.851
They're looking into all
the high school swim coaches

25:54.886 --> 25:58.088
on the island; can't be
more than a few dozen.

25:58.123 --> 26:01.792
They'll put together a photo
array for Kelsey to look at.

26:01.827 --> 26:05.863
Then we'll track down the john
and flip him for the pimp.

26:13.038 --> 26:16.907
You sure you're okay?

26:18.910 --> 26:21.912
I know it's not a good thing
for a cop to get angry.

26:21.947 --> 26:23.647
To get emotional.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.219
But I can't help it.

26:32.824 --> 26:35.392
It's fine to get angry.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.195
(exhales)

26:38.230 --> 26:39.896
You want to sit this one out?

26:39.931 --> 26:40.931
No.

26:40.966 --> 26:42.933
Good.

26:45.404 --> 26:46.770
(elevator bell dings)

26:47.939 --> 26:49.906
Thanks, Tony. I'll
take him from here.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.910
This way.

26:55.847 --> 26:58.181
Look who's here.

26:58.216 --> 27:00.985
Hey, I got a couple of those.

27:01.853 --> 27:02.986
Nice hardware.

27:03.021 --> 27:04.921
That's not for you.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.790
All right, Makoa.
You told the sheriff

27:06.825 --> 27:08.425
you had some information for us.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.394
Yeah, we'll get to that.

27:10.429 --> 27:11.528
First we got to talk
ground rules.

27:11.564 --> 27:13.830
I'm gonna need some assurance
that whatever I tell you

27:13.865 --> 27:15.832
won't be used against me.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.868
(imitates whirring)

27:20.005 --> 27:21.938
That's the Cone of Silence.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.674
Go ahead, you can say
whatever you want now.

27:23.709 --> 27:26.109
What's that?

27:26.144 --> 27:28.712
Oh, it basically means
that whatever you say here

27:28.747 --> 27:29.780
will stay here.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.849
How does Cone of Silence
mean that?

27:32.884 --> 27:34.418
Oh, brother.
I got this, gentlemen.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.187
It comes from the iconic
television comedy<i> Get Smart.</i>

27:37.222 --> 27:39.756
The Cone of Silence
was a Plexiglas enclosure

27:39.791 --> 27:41.425
which was lowered over the heads

27:41.460 --> 27:42.993
of two or more individuals
who wished to engage

27:43.028 --> 27:44.161
in private conversation.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.331
The thing isn't
rea-- you know,

27:48.366 --> 27:50.000
I should've never said it.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.401
CHIN: All right, you know what, Makoa?
You have our word.

27:51.436 --> 27:53.236
What do you got?

27:53.271 --> 27:55.906
That crew I told you about?

27:55.941 --> 27:57.007
Did some research.

27:57.042 --> 27:59.710
They didn't have anything
to do with what's going on.

27:59.745 --> 28:03.080
Then, about an hour ago,
I get a package.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.850
This was inside.

28:06.885 --> 28:08.886
Open it.

28:12.390 --> 28:13.890
"Want it back? Keep this handy.

28:13.925 --> 28:15.425
We'll be in touch."

28:15.460 --> 28:18.161
MAKOA: I've seen this play before.
Someone hits the house,

28:18.196 --> 28:21.031
then ransoms the product back
for 20 cents on the dollar.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.201
Okay. So why are you
giving it to us?

28:24.236 --> 28:26.970
Mark, the counselor at the home,

28:27.005 --> 28:28.472
we grew up together.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.041
I want you to catch
whoever killed him.

28:39.184 --> 28:40.884
Hi. Can I help you?
Joe Cardiff?

28:40.919 --> 28:43.820
I'm Commander Steve McGarrett,
this is Officer Kono Kalakaua.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.856
We're with Five-O.

28:47.325 --> 28:48.959
Do you know her?

28:49.995 --> 28:51.829
Uh...

28:53.231 --> 28:55.031
(coughing)

28:55.066 --> 28:57.501
I wasn't really asking.

28:57.536 --> 29:00.070
She picked you
out of a photo array.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.308
What about this guy?

29:06.144 --> 29:07.978
Look at him.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.781
STEVE: I'd do what she says
if I were you.

29:11.817 --> 29:13.984
Yes.

29:14.019 --> 29:15.051
Good.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.487
You're gonna help us find him.

29:24.062 --> 29:26.263
(dog barking)

29:26.298 --> 29:28.265
I'll do whatever you guys ask.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.801
But please, not here.

29:30.836 --> 29:33.036
My wife's gonna be home
any minute. Can we just...

29:33.071 --> 29:34.571
We're doing this now.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.940
Please. I have a family.

29:36.975 --> 29:37.908
Mr. Cardiff.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.509
You got much
bigger problems

29:39.544 --> 29:41.011
than explaining to your wife

29:41.046 --> 29:42.979
what you like to do
to little girls, pal.

29:43.014 --> 29:44.213
You're going to prison,
you understand me?

29:44.249 --> 29:49.085
How long for depends on how
cooperative you are right now.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.020
Make the call.

29:54.059 --> 29:55.525
Put it on speaker.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.328
WOMAN:
Leave a message.

29:58.363 --> 30:02.899
Yeah, hi...
I'm, I'm looking for a date.

30:02.934 --> 30:05.101
555-0178.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.970
How long till they
get back to you?

30:07.005 --> 30:09.139
A date.
Is that what you call it?

30:09.174 --> 30:10.106
How long until
they get back to you?

30:10.141 --> 30:11.942
A few minutes.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.977
Sometimes longer.

30:17.148 --> 30:20.917
Help me out here.

30:20.952 --> 30:23.220
What's a guy like you,
with everything--

30:23.255 --> 30:26.990
a good job, a nice home,
a loving family--

30:27.025 --> 30:28.391
what compels that guy

30:28.426 --> 30:31.261
to make that call?

30:32.664 --> 30:34.131
I'm just curious.

30:38.603 --> 30:40.103
Look at me.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.008
Kelsey's not much older
than some of your students.

30:45.043 --> 30:46.977
Would you do to them
what you did to her?

30:47.012 --> 30:48.945
Hey.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.981
She said she enjoyed
what she did.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.883
She said that.

30:52.918 --> 30:55.518
And you believed her?

30:55.553 --> 30:58.889
Do you think those girls
do what they do out of choice?

30:58.924 --> 31:00.190
Or out of survival?

31:00.225 --> 31:02.359
They're slaves.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.027
They're beaten and brutalized
like slaves.

31:04.062 --> 31:05.428
They're branded like slaves.

31:05.463 --> 31:06.963
Girls as young as seven.

31:06.998 --> 31:09.099
Made to service a dozen guys
like you every day,

31:09.134 --> 31:10.400
seven days a week.

31:10.435 --> 31:12.169
(phone chimes)

31:14.205 --> 31:16.139
Oh, we got it. Hotel on Nimitz.

31:21.179 --> 31:22.078
Hey.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.214
So, Eric was able
to pull the location data

31:24.249 --> 31:27.017
off the prepaid phone
that was sent to Makoa.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.385
According to him,
it was first turned on

31:28.420 --> 31:30.553
in a convenience store
in Waikiki.

31:30.588 --> 31:32.689
HPD talked to the manager there.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.457
They checked the sales record

31:34.492 --> 31:37.694
and the security footage
and were able to I.D. the buyer.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.963
Well, look at that.

31:39.998 --> 31:41.164
You guys know her?

31:41.199 --> 31:44.100
Yeah.

31:44.135 --> 31:46.069
GROVER:
Stacy.

31:46.104 --> 31:49.072
GROVER: You're a pretty
smart girl there, baby Stace.

31:49.107 --> 31:50.540
'Cause as far as we can tell,

31:50.575 --> 31:52.709
none of the folks who came
through Clear Path had any idea

31:52.744 --> 31:54.978
there was meth in the walls.

31:55.013 --> 31:57.314
But you figured that
out, didn't you?

31:57.349 --> 31:59.115
What'd you do,
see all those dehumidifiers

31:59.150 --> 32:01.051
and the two guys
and put it together?

32:01.086 --> 32:03.153
Or did you just, uh,
hear a little something

32:03.188 --> 32:04.688
through the grapevine?

32:04.723 --> 32:06.523
The trouble is,
you may be an ex-junkie,

32:06.558 --> 32:08.258
but you're not a killer.

32:08.293 --> 32:10.460
Which is where
your boyfriend comes in.

32:10.495 --> 32:12.095
And we're not
talking about Todd.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.097
We're talking
about Calvin.

32:14.132 --> 32:16.499
We know you've been
seeing him on the side

32:16.534 --> 32:19.569
while Todd has been trying
to put his life back together.

32:21.573 --> 32:24.607
I got some bad news
for you, Stace.

32:24.642 --> 32:26.209
Five-O! Freeze!

32:28.513 --> 32:30.147
(grunts)

32:32.083 --> 32:34.217
Calvin didn't make it.

32:34.252 --> 32:36.586
CHIN: And we found a bunch
of guns in the house

32:36.621 --> 32:38.488
that lab is running
ballistics on right now,

32:38.523 --> 32:41.291
and if one of those weapons
is the murder weapon,

32:41.326 --> 32:43.126
you're going to prison
as an accessory.

32:43.161 --> 32:45.028
You know, I got to hand
it to you, though.

32:45.063 --> 32:46.663
That was pretty
smart calling us in.

32:46.698 --> 32:49.165
Deflect suspicion
from yourself.

32:49.200 --> 32:53.003
But then when you buy
a prepaid burner phone

32:53.038 --> 32:54.237
that we could easily trace...

32:54.272 --> 32:57.107
I mean, you can do
better than that, Stacy.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.609
That's an amateur move.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.325
I got something.
I got something, guys.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.359
Everybody, stand by.

33:16.394 --> 33:18.228
Could be them.
If it is,

33:18.263 --> 33:20.130
we wait until the girl
is safely out of the vehicle.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.565
Nobody move until she's out
of the vehicle.

33:23.401 --> 33:25.068
Hold.

33:25.103 --> 33:26.370
You got eyes?
Mm-hmm.

33:30.108 --> 33:32.075
It's got to be them.

33:32.110 --> 33:33.676
Go, go, go.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.478
HPD, hold.
- Stay right there, stay right there.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.047
No, no. You're coming with
me, you're coming with me.

33:37.082 --> 33:38.081
Come on, let's go.

33:38.783 --> 33:40.717
Move, move, HPD. Go, go, go.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.053
(tires screeching,
sirens wailing)

33:50.795 --> 33:52.763
(tires screeching)

34:12.383 --> 34:14.384
(breathing heavily)

34:24.796 --> 34:28.731
(faintly):
Hold. Hold.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.133
Hands. Let me see your hands.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.169
Right now.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.374
Sit down.

34:40.178 --> 34:41.711
Aren't you gonna take me
to the doctor or something?

34:41.746 --> 34:45.615
Oh, yeah, that's, uh, that's
one of our top priorities.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.584
You're Emilio's right hand,
aren't you?

34:47.619 --> 34:49.786
What do they call
women like you?

34:49.821 --> 34:50.887
Bottoms, right?

34:50.922 --> 34:53.690
You help turn
those girls out,

34:53.725 --> 34:55.625
keep them in line.

34:55.660 --> 34:57.494
20 years.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.596
20 years

34:59.631 --> 35:01.598
is what you get for
sex trafficking.

35:01.633 --> 35:04.501
You help us, though,
maybe we can, uh,

35:04.536 --> 35:07.904
chip a bit off that for you.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.540
Just giving a friend
a ride. That's all.

35:10.575 --> 35:12.442
What she does with her
body is her business.

35:12.477 --> 35:14.244
That's not what she says.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.379
Well, doesn't matter
what she says today.

35:16.414 --> 35:18.348
She got to go into
court to say it.

35:18.383 --> 35:20.650
I know how this goes, honey.

35:20.685 --> 35:22.652
Those little bitches
never testify.

35:22.687 --> 35:24.888
It's just... too scary,
too humiliating.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.589
STEVE:
Let me ask you a question.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.725
You remember Kelsey?

35:28.760 --> 35:31.294
Sure you do

35:31.329 --> 35:33.196
because you took
a belt to her, didn't you?

35:33.231 --> 35:34.597
And then you locked her
in a closet to starve,

35:34.632 --> 35:35.765
but we found her,

35:35.800 --> 35:37.800
and you know what?
She's a tough kid.

35:37.835 --> 35:40.837
She's gonna testify
and after she does,

35:40.872 --> 35:45.508
all those other girls,
they're gonna follow suit.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.510
KONO: Let me break it
down for you, Tori.

35:47.545 --> 35:49.512
Tonight you're gonna stay at the
women's correctional facility.

35:49.547 --> 35:51.748
We know a lot of inmates there.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.383
Some of them owe us favors,

35:53.418 --> 35:54.517
other ones looking
to get on our good side.

35:54.552 --> 35:55.451
You see where
I'm going with this?

35:55.487 --> 36:00.623
Those women will do
to you whatever we ask,

36:00.658 --> 36:03.193
and the guards will
look the other way.

36:03.228 --> 36:06.296
So, this is how you want
to play it, that's fine

36:06.331 --> 36:09.632
'cause tonight you're the one
that's getting the beatdown.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.768
You're the one that's
getting turned out.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.545
1245 Kaiaka.

Hey! Five-O!
Show me your hands!

36:37.729 --> 36:39.729
Hands.
Where's Emilio?

36:39.764 --> 36:41.564
Don't know, man.
- Huh, where is he?

36:41.599 --> 36:43.466
I swear, man, I don't know. Where is he?
Where is he?!

36:43.501 --> 36:44.801
All right, go find
the girls. I got it.

36:44.836 --> 36:47.437
We got a locked door.

36:47.472 --> 36:49.505
GROVER: Get down on the
ground on your stomach.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.374
Hands behind your head,
interlock your fingers.

36:51.409 --> 36:52.442
Get down on the ground

36:52.477 --> 36:54.244
or you're gonna be wearing
one of these bullets.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.316
(all scream)

37:01.686 --> 37:03.419
Okay. We're police officers.

37:03.454 --> 37:04.988
Okay?
CHIN: It's okay.

37:05.023 --> 37:05.855
Are you okay?

37:05.891 --> 37:07.957
CHIN: It's all right.
I'm from Five-O.

37:07.992 --> 37:10.260
KONO:
We got you.

37:10.295 --> 37:11.361
Are you Moani?

37:11.396 --> 37:12.629
Okay.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.030
GROVER: Hey! I got
eyes on Emilio!

37:14.065 --> 37:15.965
He's headed next door!

37:16.000 --> 37:18.768
Kono.

37:18.803 --> 37:20.003
You got 'em?

37:37.021 --> 37:39.022
Freeze.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.330
Pick it up.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.566
Do it.
Come on.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.001
You like hurting girls,
don't you?

37:52.036 --> 37:53.036
I'm a girl.

38:11.356 --> 38:11.888
(grunts)

38:15.360 --> 38:16.493
(grunts)

38:19.397 --> 38:21.298
(groans, shouts)

38:30.375 --> 38:32.609
(grunts, shouts)

38:36.381 --> 38:37.414
(groans)

38:43.821 --> 38:45.588
(grunting)

39:00.972 --> 39:03.473
He had a knife.

39:26.664 --> 39:28.131
So, they're gonna
take the girls

39:28.166 --> 39:29.699
over to King's Medical
and get checked out.

39:31.836 --> 39:33.703
You know, you might want
to head over there yourself,

39:33.738 --> 39:34.838
get that hand looked at.

39:37.141 --> 39:39.476
Okay.

40:01.165 --> 40:04.200
So, how long will
the girls stay?

40:04.235 --> 40:06.068
A couple of days,
but the social workers

40:06.103 --> 40:08.671
and case managers will arrange
services before they go.

40:08.706 --> 40:13.209
It'll be hard
to reintegrate.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.677
They'll need a lot of support.

40:14.712 --> 40:18.014
How's Moani doing?

40:18.049 --> 40:19.482
About what you'd expect.

40:19.517 --> 40:21.217
She's with her parents now.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.220
After she's discharged, she'll
spend some time at Pearl Haven.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.488
Pearl Haven?

40:25.523 --> 40:29.125
It's a place for underage girls
who've been sexually exploited.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.027
Kind of a sanctuary, actually.

40:31.062 --> 40:34.897
It's run by a group
called Ho'ola Na Pua.

40:34.932 --> 40:38.501
So, is it possible to come back
from something like this?

40:38.536 --> 40:43.740
Yes... but it won't be easy.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.491
Sorry, I just wanted
to check on her.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.161
MAN:
I-It's okay.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.729
Would you like to come in?

41:16.240 --> 41:18.508
Hi, Moani.

41:18.543 --> 41:19.476
How are you doing?

41:22.747 --> 41:25.482
Thank you.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.906
Well, if it's
all right with you,

41:49.941 --> 41:53.209
I was wondering if I could
visit you next week.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.610
Maybe take you
out for lunch.

41:54.645 --> 41:56.913
Okay.
WOMAN: Hi.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.948
You must be Moani.
Welcome to Pearl Haven.

41:58.983 --> 42:00.583
Thanks.

42:00.618 --> 42:01.517
I know you want
to get settled,

42:01.553 --> 42:03.953
but you want to meet
some of the girls first?

42:03.988 --> 42:05.254
Okay. Here,
let me get this.

42:05.289 --> 42:06.255
Okay.
- Thanks for bringing her.

42:06.290 --> 42:08.291
Of course, of course.

42:11.662 --> 42:14.330
(girls laughing)

42:14.365 --> 42:16.165
Hey, so, I'll, um,

42:16.200 --> 42:18.200
I'll see you next week?

42:18.235 --> 42:19.702
Okay.

42:19.737 --> 42:20.670
And, uh, you have my number,

42:20.705 --> 42:24.807
so, if you ever need
anything, call me anytime.

42:24.842 --> 42:26.309
Okay.

42:26.344 --> 42:28.678
Okay. I'll see you soon.
