WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:05.088
Okay, we still need wine, cheese, flowers.
Oh, We have to stop by the bakery.

00:05.172 --> 00:08.592
Yeah. And we need a hostess gift
for Longinus' Friends-giving party.

00:08.592 --> 00:10.969
You know, she doesn't
look kindly on an empty-handed guest.

00:11.053 --> 00:12.221
Ugh. It's too much.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.306
I know, but what do you
expect from somebody who changed her name

00:14.306 --> 00:16.808
from "Larry Jones"
to "Longinus St. Germain"?

00:16.892 --> 00:19.770
No, I mean this list, okay?
We're only making it to my dad's by 4:00

00:19.770 --> 00:20.854
if we blow off the hostess

00:20.938 --> 00:22.064
formerly known as Larry.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.316
No. His party is my favorite
thing about Thanksgiving.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.484
Like when we all go around
the table and say

00:25.484 --> 00:27.653
one thing we're thankful
for not wearing this year.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.154
No, no, I'm sorry. Sorry.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.240
Even skipping the party,
we're barely gonna make it in time.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.867
All right. Here, let's divvy
these up and meet back here.

00:33.951 --> 00:34.952
Okay, fine.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.955
- Hi, Mitch.
- Oh! Hi, Ronaldo.

00:37.955 --> 00:40.165
- Let me guess. Is it for Longinus?
- Oh!

00:40.249 --> 00:42.417
I would never get something
this shabby for that judgy queen.

00:42.501 --> 00:45.254
- No, my mom is in the hospital.
- Oh, my God.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.380
Will I see you guys at the party?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.631
Oh, Unfortunately, no.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.633
This day has turned
into something of a nightmare.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.094
- Oh! Where's Cam?
- We just split up.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.763
We just needed so many different things.
It was easier to separate.

00:54.847 --> 00:57.391
So, anyway, happy Thanksgiving.
Tell everyone I said hi.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.563
Super sad news.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.106
Guess who just broke up?

01:04.606 --> 01:06.275
Hint, you owe me 50 bucks.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.125
Luke, stop eating
all the marshmallows.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.418
Those yams need
all the help that they can get.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.794
Alex, how's the stuffing?

01:26.295 --> 01:27.546
You tell me.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.840
Why do we even have this stupid holiday?

01:30.340 --> 01:32.676
Mom and Dad have been incredible.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.887
Letting me, Dylan,
and the twins live with them,

01:34.887 --> 01:37.764
helping with midnight feedings,
bedtime stories.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.267
Dylan loves it
when my dad does the voices.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.270
So I'm giving my mom
a break from cooking Thanksgiving dinner.

01:43.395 --> 01:46.231
I wanted to do something special
to thank them for being there for me.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.193
I'm sorry. I just, uh...

01:49.902 --> 01:52.112
I've become such
a beautiful person!

01:54.615 --> 01:56.033
Happy Thanksgiving, Jay.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.160
Oh, I can slide over
if you wanna watch this with me.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.829
No, I never saw the point
of a parade without tanks.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.916
I'm gonna take the plane out for a spin.
You wanna come with?

02:03.916 --> 02:05.125
Me?

02:05.209 --> 02:07.961
Go... Fly?

02:08.212 --> 02:11.965
I played it cool,
but I was pretty jazzed.

02:12.424 --> 02:15.928
It's been ten years since Jay asked me
to go model-plane flying with him,

02:15.928 --> 02:17.179
and I was, uh...

02:18.639 --> 02:22.309
I was eager to replace that memory
with a... A better one.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.269
Okay, let's do it!

02:24.770 --> 02:25.896
Whoo!

02:32.903 --> 02:33.987
Where you guys going?

02:34.071 --> 02:35.531
Oh, nowhere special.

02:35.531 --> 02:38.367
Let's just say that Jay has asked me
to join his mile-high club.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.535
Let's not say that.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.787
Cool. You know, years ago I almost joined

02:41.787 --> 02:44.331
the female-dominated world
of flight attendants.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.251
My fellow nurses still needle me about it.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.378
- Can I come?
- Uh, Actually, Jay is pretty...

02:49.378 --> 02:50.587
Sure, why not?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.215
Looks like
we're having a threesome.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.550
You're embarrassing yourself.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.555
The turkey is still frozen in the middle.

02:59.555 --> 03:03.767
Hot on the outside, cold on the inside.
Reminds me of a certain someone.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.394
- Please don't ask.
- Sure.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.437
Oh! This pie-filling is so sour.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.315
Yeah. It's devastating when you
expect something to be sweet,

03:10.399 --> 03:13.193
but ends up being
intense psychosexual torture.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.487
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Cool, cool.

03:15.571 --> 03:19.449
Don't worry. Luke's famous Jell-O mold
is here to save your sorry butts.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.201
Ah!

03:22.160 --> 03:23.495
I can't have the one nice thing

03:23.579 --> 03:25.038
I've done for Mom and Dad be a disaster.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.499
Alex, um, can you please call
that chef that you're dating?

03:27.583 --> 03:29.251
Ugh! That pompous weirdo?

03:29.251 --> 03:31.420
I purposely broke up with him
before the holidays.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.798
If I call him now,
I will be stuck with him until New Year's.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.384
There's a school of thought it can even
stretch out to Valentine's Day.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.303
Once you pass Thanksgiving,
it's the Wild West.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.347
Okay, her name is Jessica.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.807
We met during a Santa Ana wind,

03:43.891 --> 03:45.684
and we all know
what Raymond Chandler said...

03:45.684 --> 03:49.271
So no need to repeat it.
Alex, please, how weird can your chef be?

03:51.273 --> 03:53.984
I don't know if it's 'cause he's a chef,
and they can be controlling,

03:53.984 --> 03:57.321
and, I know, there's lots
of different love languages, but...

03:58.488 --> 03:59.656
He puppets me.

04:01.033 --> 04:04.119
You want them to be super thin
and uniform, like this.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.664
You're tearing up from the onions. Here.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.668
Mmm.

04:11.835 --> 04:12.836
And blow.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.838
You know, maybe I'll just go
to the bathroom and do this.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.256
Okay, sure. Let's go.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.221
Aw! Joe, you're doing place cards?

04:22.221 --> 04:23.931
Doesn't Manny usually
take care of seating?

04:23.931 --> 04:26.016
- He's "going through something."
- Ah!

04:26.141 --> 04:28.977
I'm sure we'll hear a spoken
word about it soon enough.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.563
You really are turning into
a four-foot version of my dad.

04:31.647 --> 04:32.814
Our dad.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.567
That will never not be weird.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.320
Gloria, you do laundry?

04:38.320 --> 04:40.447
Are you hiding a pregnancy?

04:40.531 --> 04:43.200
- No, the housekeeper quit.
- Aw!

04:43.534 --> 04:45.869
I really love working for Phil

04:45.953 --> 04:48.622
- full-time for very little money...
- Mmm.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.960
...but I didn't realize how hard
it was going to be, balancing everything.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.212
I know. That's why I love not working.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.965
Finally, enough time
to get everything done.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.258
- Really?
- Mmm.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.885
You don't miss facing new challenges,

05:01.969 --> 05:06.306
the fire of competition,
that sense of accomplishment?

05:07.724 --> 05:08.851
No. No.

05:08.851 --> 05:11.520
I mean, of course,
I worried I was the type of person

05:11.520 --> 05:13.313
who needed to be busy all the time.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.775
But it's like a drug.
After a couple of weeks of withdrawal,

05:16.859 --> 05:20.153
I am finally comfortable doing nothing.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.572
Mmm.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.083
Oh! What kind of pie did you get?
Pumpkin? Pecan? Sweet potato?

05:33.083 --> 05:34.585
Flourless chocolate cake.

05:34.585 --> 05:35.794
Let's see you try and country that up.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.547
Oh, my phone's in my pocket.
Here, would you grab it? I can't get it.

05:38.547 --> 05:39.798
Yeah, all right.

05:39.882 --> 05:41.758
Who is it?
- Oh, it's from Jotham.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.136
"Just heard, I'm so sorry.
How are you doing?"

05:44.136 --> 05:45.762
- What's that about?
- I have no idea.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.181
Oh, from Michael.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.433
"Sending all my love, Cam-embert.
Call me."

05:49.558 --> 05:50.642
What?

05:50.726 --> 05:53.562
Artemis. "Ronaldo told me
about you and Mitchell."

05:53.562 --> 05:57.441
Broken heart emoji, tear emoji,
Tammy Faye Bakker crying gif.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.151
What did Ronaldo tell him?

05:59.151 --> 06:01.570
I have no clue.
I... I just saw him here,

06:01.570 --> 06:04.573
and he asked where you were,
and I told him that we split up to shop...

06:05.157 --> 06:06.992
Oh, my God,
he thinks we actually split up.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.869
Oh, and it's gone viral.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.246
Well, there are two things
a gay can't sit on,

06:11.330 --> 06:13.707
a plastic patio chair
and a juicy bit of gossip.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.418
Well, it's nice to see
how supportive our friends are being.

06:16.502 --> 06:19.838
It's nice how quickly
they reached out to... To you!

06:19.922 --> 06:21.840
I got nothing.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.717
It's like it's mocking me.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.677
I'm sure the texts
are meant for both of us.

06:25.761 --> 06:26.929
That's not how it works, okay?

06:26.929 --> 06:29.431
They're not thanking us for brunch.
We're getting a divorce.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.308
Why is no one calling me?

06:31.308 --> 06:34.728
Well, maybe because they think
you're the stronger, less emotional one.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.313
That's crazy. Just because I'm strong

06:36.313 --> 06:38.607
doesn't mean I don't need
my friends at a time like this.

06:38.607 --> 06:42.110
A time like what? You realize
this isn't actually happening, right?

06:42.194 --> 06:43.946
Oh, come on,
if the shoe was on the other foot,

06:43.946 --> 06:45.364
you would be freaking out.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.699
Yes, which is why
I'm getting all the texts.

06:47.783 --> 06:48.951
Okay. Well, here.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.912
From Steven and Stefan in Capri.
Text back,

06:52.454 --> 06:54.623
"Do not fly home. I'm doing okay."

06:54.623 --> 06:56.750
I thought this wasn't really happening.

06:59.837 --> 07:02.297
Barrel roll into an S-turn

07:03.215 --> 07:05.759
and a little thing
I call "Pritchett switch-it."

07:06.385 --> 07:08.136
That just looks like a right-hand turn.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.639
It would to an amateur.
You're an artist, Jay.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.267
The sky is your canvas.
Oh, should we do the hoop?

07:13.267 --> 07:14.935
Great idea. Hey, champ.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.563
Take this out to the middle
of the field and hold it up.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.814
Awesome.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.025
Guess it's champ's turn.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.611
Are we sure champ doesn't need
to see how it's done properly first?

07:24.695 --> 07:25.696
I mean, it's not just standing there.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.406
Dylan, just stand there!

07:33.829 --> 07:37.165
Yes! What a wonderful shared experience.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.793
Now, stay out there. We'll do it again.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.296
Kid's a natural. He didn't even flinch.

07:42.296 --> 07:45.048
Bravery or a sluggish brain.
Guess we'll never know.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.218
I'm sorry.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.263
I'm a little annoyed
that Dylan's horning in on our thing.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.266
Hey, you know what,
my hands are cramping up.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.684
- You wanna take over for me here?
- Really?

07:55.684 --> 07:57.019
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

07:57.311 --> 08:01.648
Listen, is it possible that you're angry
at Dylan for something more than today?

08:02.107 --> 08:04.234
Well, he did take the last
waffle this morning.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.112
I think it's more about,
he took your firstborn.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.364
Now, I've been there. That's only natural.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.657
You know, us dads,

08:10.741 --> 08:12.743
we're very protective
of our daughters, but...

08:13.202 --> 08:16.580
In fact, you may get a very strong impulse
to fly that plane right into the guy.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.789
But don't do it.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.750
What? I would never hurt Dylan.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.543
Why would you even think
I'd have that impulse?

08:21.627 --> 08:24.463
I don't know. I thought...
The way you were looking at him.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.547
Wait.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.383
Is that what you were thinking
ten years ago?

08:28.467 --> 08:30.719
All this time, I thought it was my fault.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.846
I moved my head at the last second, but...

08:33.055 --> 08:35.724
- You hit me on purpose!
- Don't be ridiculous. I just...

08:35.724 --> 08:36.975
You just what, Jay?

08:37.059 --> 08:39.478
Thought it'd be fun
to fly a plane into my face?

08:39.478 --> 08:42.105
What kind of monster does that
to another human being?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.276
Oh, no.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.533
Look at this.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.663
Okay, I think it's good for now.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.499
Yeah, yeah.
You need to enjoy your me-time.

09:00.499 --> 09:04.461
- Yeah.
- Yesterday, I had three open houses.

09:04.545 --> 09:08.298
I was running around all day,
solving problems, creating value.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.551
It was exhausting.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.594
Yeah. Don't miss that.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.015
Oh. And one of the houses was filthy.

09:17.099 --> 09:19.852
- All the windows needed to be washed.
- Oh.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.937
Ugh. But I am one to talk.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.698
Follow my instructions,
and we can save this meal.

09:32.698 --> 09:33.824
- Who are you?
- Manny.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.285
Wrong. In this kitchen,
you don't have a name. Stir.

09:36.285 --> 09:37.786
This is a fun energy.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.830
Do you happen to have a cousin
partial to western skirts

09:39.830 --> 09:41.123
and terrifying mood swings?

09:41.123 --> 09:42.416
We need him. Just do it.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.959
Those carrots are a mess.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.794
- It's like this.
- Wait, what?

09:45.878 --> 09:48.172
Oh, man, you really
know what you want.

09:48.172 --> 09:49.256
I feel so safe.

09:50.716 --> 09:53.051
That needs more salt.
That needs more cream.

09:53.135 --> 09:57.181
And, Alex, I have a souffle in that oven
valiantly trying to rise.

09:57.181 --> 09:59.349
Would you mind not pounding
those walnuts

09:59.433 --> 10:01.602
like you're Quasimodo
just going at his bell?

10:01.602 --> 10:04.021
You know what, Neil?
I don't know how...

10:04.021 --> 10:05.355
Are these too hot?

10:09.359 --> 10:11.320
Claire, why are you washing our windows?

10:11.695 --> 10:15.824
I don't know. They're really dirty,
and your mom found a pole.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.576
You know, funny coincidence,

10:17.576 --> 10:21.038
last week, I was offered
the top job at a company that makes poles.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.290
Yeah. I'm going through something, too.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.877
Anyway, I turned the job down,
but I think I'm reconsidering it.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.337
Her name is Jessica.

10:28.587 --> 10:31.673
I know that poles
aren't as sexy as closets,

10:31.757 --> 10:34.259
but people really seem to like them.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.512
And they are famously recession-proof.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.805
Oh, God,
I think I made a terrible mistake.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.808
I gotta call those people
and get that job before it goes away.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.769
Don't do it, Claire. It's beneath you.

10:43.769 --> 10:47.064
Woah. Manny, show some respect.
If it weren't for poles,

10:47.064 --> 10:48.690
you would be pledging
allegiance to a floor mat.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.025
- Now, give me my phone.
- No!

10:50.192 --> 10:53.654
You can't take a job on the rebound.
It'll feel good for a minute,

10:53.862 --> 10:57.032
but then you're plummeting down
a K-hole of paranoia and regret.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.951
Huh. How was your week?

10:59.535 --> 11:01.286
Fine, I'll tell you
why I'm wearing a turtleneck.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.831
After Sherry dumped me,
I dated the first girl who would have me,

11:05.249 --> 11:08.085
ironically, the leading
rebounder on her basketball team.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.254
That's where she hit me
with her mouth guard.

11:10.671 --> 11:11.839
I've tried to leave her,

11:11.839 --> 11:14.132
but she just pulls my head,
and I run in place.

11:14.216 --> 11:17.386
I'm sorry this is happening to you, Manny,
but what does this have to do with...

11:17.386 --> 11:19.054
She's the pole company, Claire.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.056
Learn from my mistake,

11:21.056 --> 11:23.141
unless you want
a compromising polaroid of you

11:23.225 --> 11:25.394
hung up very high
in the women's locker room.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.813
I might need to borrow that ladder later.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.863
- Claire?
- Hmm?

11:35.863 --> 11:39.741
Do you want to help me
shop online later for some power suits?

11:40.158 --> 11:43.829
Oh, God, I miss wearing
comfortable clothes all the time

11:43.829 --> 11:44.913
like you do.

11:44.997 --> 11:47.165
Yup. That sounds like a lot of fun. I...

11:48.250 --> 11:49.293
What am I doing?

11:49.543 --> 11:51.420
A terrific job. Keep going.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.882
No, no! I have been sweating
ever since I got here.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.968
Did you trick me
into doing your housework?

11:58.427 --> 11:59.595
No.

12:04.433 --> 12:05.684
Uh-uh. That phone did not ring.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.644
You're walking away because
you know you're guilty.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.230
And take those shoes off!
I just did the floors!

12:11.064 --> 12:14.610
My friends' reaction to our
"divorce" really bothered me,

12:14.610 --> 12:18.113
so I made an excuse to Cam
and went over to Longinus' party.

12:18.322 --> 12:21.742
I wanted the friends to know that
I am just as emotionally needy as Cam.

12:27.331 --> 12:29.875
Hey, girl, hey. I can't believe you came.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.752
- Oh, my God, how's Cam?
- Yes, how is he? We were worried.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.922
Cam's fine. He's fine.
It was just a big misunderstanding.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.215
We're not getting a divorce.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.803
Well, girl, come on in.
Let's get you two drinks.

12:41.887 --> 12:44.348
One for each empty hand
you showed up to the party with.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.225
Well, I could use it.

12:46.225 --> 12:50.354
I mean, even though it's not
true about the divorce, it could be.

12:50.896 --> 12:54.024
You know, someday.
And that just... That just makes me so...

12:55.817 --> 12:56.860
Confused?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.779
Angry. Furious.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.864
<i>- The Fast and the Furious.</i>
- Okay, this isn't charades.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.032
I'm sad.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.575
- That's your sad?
- Yes.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.202
- That's your sad?
- Yeah.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.704
And I really need your support right now.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.458
Wait, something new is happening.

13:14.336 --> 13:17.506
Oh, my God. How can you not see
how emotionally raw I am right now?

13:17.965 --> 13:20.592
Huh? Nothing lasts forever.

13:20.676 --> 13:22.094
What happens when it's over?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.471
Poor Cam, he is so fragile.

13:24.555 --> 13:26.807
- He's gonna lose it.
- We'll be there for him.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.725
Who will be there to dry these tears?

13:30.811 --> 13:32.938
What tears? Where they at?

13:38.652 --> 13:40.320
No, not again!

13:40.404 --> 13:42.447
It wasn't me this time.
He did it to himself.

13:42.531 --> 13:46.869
Unlike last time, when you purposely
flew that plane into my face.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.621
- You're a monster, Jay.
- Who are you calling a monster?

13:49.705 --> 13:51.206
Um, he just said. Jay.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.084
This isn't worth it.
Why do I do anything with people?

13:55.002 --> 13:57.129
I'm pretty sure
you don't have a concussion,

13:57.129 --> 13:59.923
but I'm gonna stay here just in case,
so you don't fall asleep.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.260
Gloria, should you go get Mrs. D?

14:03.260 --> 14:05.012
Yeah, sure. I see if I can find her.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.183
Claire!

14:13.687 --> 14:14.897
Hey. Seen Cam?

14:15.147 --> 14:17.232
And a happy Thanksgiving to you.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.443
That's a lot of attitude.
You sound like my dad.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.069
- Our dad.
- Ugh.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.613
There you are.

14:22.613 --> 14:25.157
So I just got a text message
from Longinus.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.743
Said you left your sunglasses
at his Friends-giving party,

14:27.743 --> 14:30.370
the one you decreed we didn't
have enough time to go to.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.039
Mitchell, you owe me an apology.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.957
I owe you an apology?

14:35.209 --> 14:37.211
I may not have bought a gift
to Longinus' party,

14:37.211 --> 14:38.837
but I sure left with one.

14:39.838 --> 14:42.382
It's like he's never seen
someone cry before.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.259
Just think of something sad.

14:44.343 --> 14:46.136
Like when a pet died,

14:46.220 --> 14:48.722
or when Michael
was a seat-filler at the Golden Globes

14:48.722 --> 14:50.766
and got to sit next to Nicole Kidman.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.100
Why him?

14:53.018 --> 14:54.728
Tommy, you must get over that.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.773
Look, the only reason
we all rallied around Cam

14:57.773 --> 15:01.485
was last time y'all broke up,
he was shattered, and you seemed fine.

15:02.653 --> 15:03.987
What last time?

15:06.031 --> 15:07.366
Apparently, years ago,

15:07.366 --> 15:10.202
Cam invented a breakup
that never really happened,

15:10.202 --> 15:12.788
just so he could gauge how much
support he could count on

15:12.788 --> 15:14.248
in the event of the real thing.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.083
Normal.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.794
It's my fault for loving him too much.

15:18.794 --> 15:21.171
- No.
- No. You can do so much better.

15:21.255 --> 15:22.756
- Honey.
- Yes.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.175
You turned everyone against me.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.136
Because in a breakup,
friends choose a side,

15:28.220 --> 15:31.640
and I'm... I'm more fragile,
and I would need them more.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.725
I was just preparing for an emergency.

15:33.809 --> 15:36.144
I didn't yell at you when you
bought that earthquake kit.

15:36.228 --> 15:38.897
You told them I'd disappear
for days at a time.

15:38.981 --> 15:39.982
Which you wouldn't know about,

15:39.982 --> 15:41.984
had you not gone
to the party behind my back.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.360
Where's the trust, Mitchell?

15:46.572 --> 15:48.282
Looks like a good place
to hide from the drama.

15:48.282 --> 15:50.742
Dad, I am so mad at your wife right now.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.160
I need a guesthouse.

15:52.244 --> 15:55.455
No, no, no. She has completely
taken advantage of my restlessness

15:55.539 --> 15:57.249
and basically turned me
into her housekeeper.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.834
How? By doing something the wrong way,

15:58.834 --> 16:00.794
knowing you'll jump in
and do it the right way?

16:01.128 --> 16:03.213
What's wrong with me?
Why can't I get these clean?

16:03.297 --> 16:04.298
Not gonna happen.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.301
I am partly to blame.

16:07.301 --> 16:10.596
I'm not good at doing nothing.

16:11.597 --> 16:15.309
How did they get fingerprints
on the inside of the glass? It's crazy.

16:15.309 --> 16:18.478
You know, I had a similar experience when
I turned the company over to you.

16:18.562 --> 16:20.689
It wasn't the activity that I missed.

16:21.190 --> 16:22.399
I missed being the boss.

16:23.275 --> 16:24.735
Yeah, I hear you there.

16:24.735 --> 16:27.070
- Giving orders, people scared of you.
- Yeah.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.032
I like day drinking,
but nothing beats being drunk with power.

16:30.032 --> 16:33.660
Yeah. Do you know how many
unfunny jokes I told at the office?

16:33.952 --> 16:35.454
- None?
- Exactly.

16:35.454 --> 16:37.122
- Knock, knock...
- "Good one, boss.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.333
"How do you keep coming up with them?"

16:39.333 --> 16:42.878
Spineless bootlickers.
God, I miss them.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.296
How did you get over it?

16:44.296 --> 16:46.757
I didn't wait around
for someone to put me in charge again.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.342
I made my own opportunity.

16:48.342 --> 16:49.718
Dad, dog beds?

16:49.718 --> 16:51.136
Better than poles.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.224
Yeah, I hear things.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.228
All right, Dylan is on twin duty,

16:59.228 --> 17:01.730
so I'm gonna make sure
you don't fall asleep.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.566
I've been asleep for the last ten years.

17:04.650 --> 17:07.778
Imagine finding out the plane
crash you were in was no accident.

17:07.778 --> 17:09.279
Well, you're not alone.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.990
Jay did something very similar to me
when Mitchell and I first got together.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.034
He "accidentally" bumped me with his car.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.328
A real car, not a toy.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.039
I was pretty bruised up.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.251
I just assumed it was because
he didn't want his son with a boyfriend,

17:22.251 --> 17:24.628
but he thought Mitchell could do better.

17:24.628 --> 17:26.505
It was a bit of a shock!

17:28.465 --> 17:29.967
But then, once I became a father,

17:29.967 --> 17:32.803
I realized how protective
you can be over your kid.

17:32.803 --> 17:35.097
There's a little boy
on Lily's soccer team always teasing her,

17:35.472 --> 17:37.057
so, at the end-of-the-season party,

17:37.057 --> 17:41.854
I may have nudged him face-first
into a freshly fried funnel cake.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.899
It is possible that

17:45.983 --> 17:50.404
I have more in common with dads
like Jay than I would like to admit.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.700
Sorry I ate the last waffle, Mr. D.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.035
I've been so hungry lately.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.788
I wonder if that means
we're pregnant again?

18:02.291 --> 18:03.667
Oh, shoot!

18:04.001 --> 18:06.253
Shoot. Shoot, shoot, shoot.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.964
Oh.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.634
Congratulations, Alex.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.012
A warren of starving rabbits
wouldn't eat these carrots.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.431
I'm starting to wonder
if our relationship should just be sexual.

18:17.431 --> 18:20.392
- Okay, Neil. Honestly...
- Hey, hey, hey, you love birds?

18:20.392 --> 18:22.561
Time for that later.
We've got a meal to finish.

18:22.561 --> 18:25.772
Can somebody call FEMA?
This meringue is a disaster.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.065
I just did what you told me.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.067
Really? I told you
to under-beat the egg whites?

18:29.151 --> 18:31.820
- I really think that...
- I think. You do.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.947
Neil, are you done with Alex?

18:34.031 --> 18:36.617
'Cause I'm having trouble
slivering these almonds.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.118
Be one with me.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.081
Hey, Jay, um...

18:44.833 --> 18:46.710
I think I overreacted earlier.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.420
I want to apologize.

18:48.795 --> 18:49.838
Forget it.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.383
If I'm being honest,
maybe on some level,

18:54.510 --> 18:56.178
I really did want
to hit you with that plane.

18:57.679 --> 18:58.847
I'm sorry, Phil.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.807
Thank you.

19:01.433 --> 19:04.978
Maybe I understand better why
a father might wanna protect a daughter.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.815
Or son. I banged Cam up pretty
good before I gave him the nod.

19:09.650 --> 19:10.692
He never figured it out.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.031
I get the impulse.
I'm guilty of it myself,

19:16.031 --> 19:17.783
but there's gotta be
a better way of handling anger

19:17.783 --> 19:19.034
than hurting someone, right?

19:20.786 --> 19:23.997
Disgusting!
If this was the first Thanksgiving,

19:24.081 --> 19:27.251
your gravy would be the worst thing this
country has done to Native Americans.

19:27.251 --> 19:29.002
- Hey, buddy.
- Yeah.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.259
Oops.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.010
What a senseless accident.

19:37.594 --> 19:38.846
What the hell?

19:39.721 --> 19:41.390
It's not the end of the world.

19:41.390 --> 19:43.517
Chefs don't need to smell things.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.894
You people are crazy.
I'm getting out of here.

19:45.978 --> 19:47.479
What a splendid idea.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.649
Enjoy the souffle.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.196
You're the best.
What's going on?

19:56.280 --> 19:57.698
Did I just hear the chef leave?

19:57.948 --> 20:00.242
It's hopeless.
I can't even tell what this was.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.578
Well, I'll see if there's
a restaurant that can take us.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.329
- Oh, I'm just going home.
- Yeah.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.791
No. No, no, no! Whoa, whoa.
No, no one is going anywhere.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.169
Listen, you know what?
We can salvage this Thanksgiving.

20:10.169 --> 20:11.795
Phil, you get the salad started.

20:12.045 --> 20:15.549
Luke, anything you don't need
dental records to identify, save.

20:15.841 --> 20:18.510
Alex, that guy was an idiot.
Pick better boyfriends.

20:19.428 --> 20:21.930
I'm sorry, Mom.
I so wanted to do this for you.

20:22.014 --> 20:25.517
Oh, honey, no.
You gave me the best gift ever.

20:25.601 --> 20:27.686
I'm bossing people around again.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.980
Luke, chop some carrots.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.398
- Phil, spin that lettuce.
- Look, I guess I just...

20:31.398 --> 20:34.067
I didn't think I would be able
to survive if you ever left me.

20:34.985 --> 20:36.320
And I still don't.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.571
Thank you.

20:37.571 --> 20:39.781
And the party wasn't that fun.

20:40.324 --> 20:41.450
Something was missing.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.953
I love when you say things
without really saying them.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.373
You meant me, right?

20:51.251 --> 20:53.754
Um... <i>Man Without a Face.</i>

20:54.213 --> 20:55.714
<i>- The Mummy.
- Coma.</i>

20:56.381 --> 20:57.674
<i>I, Robot?</i>

20:57.925 --> 20:58.926
<i>Frozen?</i>

20:59.051 --> 21:00.886
<i>- The Crying Game.</i>

21:00.886 --> 21:02.054
- Oh...
- Huh?

21:02.054 --> 21:03.138
What is wrong with you people?

21:03.722 --> 21:06.517
If he wants to see crying,
he should come and see me

21:06.517 --> 21:09.019
in the kitchen
with all these dirty dishes.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.855
Fine. I will do plates,
and I will do silverware,

21:11.939 --> 21:13.899
but nothing that requires soaking.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.360
Aw, you guys are so cute.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.321
Well, George is.
Poppy's gonna need a personality.

21:19.321 --> 21:22.241
Oh! Sorry, dude. Total accident.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.327
He's gonna be a good dad.
