01:12.458 --> 01:14.208
And I'm chilly.

01:14.291 --> 01:17.083
Can we put our coats on, Captain?

01:17.250 --> 01:19.834
What? And ruin a perfect cover?

01:19.917 --> 01:25.083
I am in disguise, you are in disguise,
the Iron Vulture is in disguise.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.583
Life is beautiful.

01:26.875 --> 01:32.417
Within moments we sail
under those Cape Suzette guns.

01:34.458 --> 01:36.667
See how convincing you are, ladies?

01:36.834 --> 01:39.834
You've got the attention of a handsome,
young sailor.

01:40.709 --> 01:44.667
Ah... Maybe he's trying
to tell us something, Captain.

01:44.834 --> 01:48.166
Nonsense. What could he be telling us?

01:48.250 --> 01:49.375
[crashing sound]

01:53.959 --> 01:55.208
Uh-oh.

01:56.792 --> 01:57.875
Retreat!

01:58.917 --> 02:02.291
[man] Now can we put
our coats on, Captain?

02:04.542 --> 02:09.250
[laughs] Those Cape Suzette gunners
can only shoot what they can see.

02:09.583 --> 02:12.458
[Don Karnage] They will not spot us
until it is too late.

02:12.625 --> 02:16.458
We are now the color of invisible.
[laughing]

02:16.625 --> 02:19.750
Today, Cape Suzette.
Tomorrow, the world.

02:19.917 --> 02:21.625
[thunder rumbles]

02:27.333 --> 02:29.125
[Don Karnage] Retreat!

02:37.083 --> 02:41.709
[Don Karnage] Not only am I a genius,
but I am very smart.

02:41.834 --> 02:45.375
This time, I have come prepared
for bad weather.

02:46.083 --> 02:50.542
[laughing]
At last I will sail into Cape Suzette

02:50.625 --> 02:54.208
right behind the noses
of those silly gunner type persons.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.333
[Officer One] Nice day for a rain cloud.

02:58.417 --> 03:01.917
Looks like a <i>cumulus piraticus </i> to me.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
When is that Don Karnage character
gonna learn he can't get past us?

03:07.083 --> 03:10.083
Remember when he dressed up
that iron vulture of his

03:10.166 --> 03:12.125
like a broccoli day parade float?

03:12.208 --> 03:16.375
[Officer One laughing]
Big Bertha here sure steamed his stems.

03:23.291 --> 03:26.917
Today, Cape Suzette. Tomorrow...

03:27.041 --> 03:28.417
[rumbles

03:28.542 --> 03:30.959
Tomorrow's another day. Retreat!

03:33.041 --> 03:36.417
[Don Karnage] I hate those gunners
with a passion fruit!

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
[Baloo laughing]
Better luck next time, Karnage.

03:42.542 --> 03:45.375
Hold your fire.
That plane's packing our lunch.

03:46.208 --> 03:50.667
Delivering sandwiches for Louie
can sure be a pain.

04:02.208 --> 04:06.625
Whew! That runway's got more
bounce than my paycheck.

04:06.709 --> 04:09.625
An amazing landing, as usual, Baloo.

04:09.709 --> 04:12.792
Well, it was nothing.
I did it with my eyes shut...

04:12.875 --> 04:14.792
And my teeth clenched.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.750
Hey, gang, feeding time.

04:20.250 --> 04:23.959
<i>Adios</i>. Enjoy your meal.
Have a nice weekend.

04:24.041 --> 04:26.625
I don't have to make
that landing again today.

04:34.583 --> 04:38.750
-Baloo, I forgot to remind you--
-Doggone it!

04:38.917 --> 04:41.583
[Officer One over radio]
<i>Come back for our 2:00 meeting.</i>

04:41.667 --> 04:47.208
Perhaps I will be back,
for my 2:00 plundering.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.834
That will be my ticket in.

04:54.333 --> 04:57.208

For my catering to keep buzzin', cousin,

05:06.333 --> 05:08.166
I can't let you eat up all the profits.

05:08.333 --> 05:11.083
Besides, I already packed you a snack.

05:11.250 --> 05:14.875
[laughing] What more could a fellow want?

05:15.041 --> 05:19.417
I got my food, I got my health, I got--

05:20.125 --> 05:22.542
The Duck! Where's my Sea Duck?

05:24.959 --> 05:26.750
I've been robbed!

05:27.125 --> 05:30.375
There she goes! I've got to catch her!

05:31.166 --> 05:34.208
In what? You were my only plane.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.291
[Louie] Hey, wait a minute.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.959
Let me check the lost and found.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.667
[Baloo] That's the best you can do?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.583
[Louie] Afraid so, Fuzzy.

05:51.667 --> 05:54.792
Some old coot left it here
because it wouldn't hold oil.

05:54.875 --> 05:59.417
With your help, this jalopy is gonna fly.

06:04.083 --> 06:06.625
This plan is foolproof,

06:06.917 --> 06:11.166
which is why I'm allowing
you fools to handle it.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.792

06:17.208 --> 06:19.542
To your places... idiots.

06:21.875 --> 06:26.542
[Mad Dog] So we make the gunners
think we're the sandwich man.

06:26.625 --> 06:30.000
Yeah. Then we take over the big gun.

06:30.166 --> 06:34.000
When the Iron Vulture comes,
we wave it through.

06:34.083 --> 06:38.125
For 57 varieties of
plundering and pillaging.

06:38.667 --> 06:44.625
Be hasty with you. My mouth is watering.
Do not disappoint me.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.333

06:52.375 --> 06:55.583
Keeping this baby oiled is a breeze.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.917
Breeze? It's a deluge.

06:59.166 --> 07:00.792
There she is.

07:01.125 --> 07:03.333
It's heading back to Cape Suzette.

07:04.083 --> 07:07.917
Lousy bunch of joy riders! Hang on, Louie.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.417
[Baloo] We're going duck hunting.

07:12.917 --> 07:15.625
Here comes Baloo, right on time.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.417
-What's with the landing, Baloo?
-Whoa, buddy.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.000
You losing your touch?

07:38.834 --> 07:43.583
[gasps] Oh, no, the mayonnaise went bad.
[coughing]

07:46.458 --> 07:50.208
The mayonnaise didn't go bad. We did!

07:50.375 --> 07:53.417
They'll love today's lunch special.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.792
Stink bombs, heavy on the mustard gas.

07:57.583 --> 08:02.625
[clears throat] This is Woodchuck
calling Peter Piper.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.291
Come in, Peter Piper.

08:05.375 --> 08:07.500
This is Peter Piper.

08:07.583 --> 08:10.458
Have you pickled their peppers?

08:10.542 --> 08:14.667
We've chucked all the wood
that a Woodchuck chucks.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.250
They're in! [chuckles]

08:16.333 --> 08:21.583
It is time to steal
sea shells by the seashore.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.542
There's my baby. Let's get her.

08:36.542 --> 08:40.375
[grunts] All right, who's the creep
who stole my plane?

08:40.457 --> 08:43.250
Darn, rusted old seat belts.

08:43.417 --> 08:46.667
Us three creeps stole your plane.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.709
Yeah, happy landing.

08:51.959 --> 08:53.750
[Baloo and Louie screaming]

08:58.583 --> 09:01.750
Louie, you can stop now. We're OK.

09:01.834 --> 09:06.000
Oh, yeah.[laughs] Good thing
we wore seat belts.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.375

09:08.667 --> 09:13.375
-Good thing we wore our parachutes.
-Oh, man, I could have-- whoa!

09:24.125 --> 09:27.041

09:32.041 --> 09:35.458
Next time, I gotta remember to
bring a trampoline.

09:36.041 --> 09:40.375
[grunts] Next time I'll remember
not to have a next time.

09:40.458 --> 09:43.709
[Barney] Aw, shucks.
You boys are doing this wrong.

09:43.792 --> 09:48.959
When you tumble, tuck your ankles
and support through the knees.

09:49.041 --> 09:50.250
Like this.

09:51.709 --> 09:53.667
[crash]

09:56.542 --> 10:01.500
[coughs] Of course,
I never fell like that before.

10:01.583 --> 10:04.291
But I've seen it done a million times.

10:04.375 --> 10:07.333
-[Baloo] Look, pal--
-O'tourette. Barney O'tourette.

10:07.417 --> 10:11.959
My friends call me--
No. That's when they're mad.

10:12.291 --> 10:16.083
Pirates stole my plane.
They've taken the cliff guns.

10:16.250 --> 10:19.750
What? I used to work those guns.

10:19.917 --> 10:23.250
No pirates are getting past my cliffs.

10:23.458 --> 10:26.750
Better do something quick, ol' buddy,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.542
'Cause there's a rusty old vulture
heading our way.

10:39.667 --> 10:42.125
It's the Iron Vulture, all right.

10:42.208 --> 10:46.041
We need a radio or something
to notify the coast guard.

10:46.208 --> 10:49.417
Ol' Barney will fix you right up.

10:52.125 --> 10:58.000
Let's go make that call.
Right up on that far ledge.

11:00.792 --> 11:05.542
You mean we've got to climb up there?

11:15.959 --> 11:17.250
[Baloo] You OK, Barney?

11:17.333 --> 11:21.750
I'll get this climbing under control.
Seen it done a million times.

11:22.875 --> 11:26.166
You've never climbed this cliff before?

11:26.333 --> 11:28.500
Never had to call anyone before.

11:29.458 --> 11:32.834
[Baloo] Man, uh... How much more to go?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.583
[grunts] Just up to that next ledge.

11:39.709 --> 11:44.125
-[Barney] Oops! Missed.
-Here. Let me try, Pops.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.917
Nice roping, Fuzzy.

11:54.375 --> 11:55.667
No problem.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.333
Aah! Problems! Problems!

12:09.375 --> 12:12.667
[Barney] By the way,
watch out for the mountain goats.

12:12.750 --> 12:16.375
They're ornery. There it is.

12:16.458 --> 12:18.333
[Baloo and Louie] A phone booth?

12:18.500 --> 12:22.542
You wanted a radio or something.
This is "or something."

12:22.625 --> 12:24.291
I'll handle this.

12:28.208 --> 12:31.083
Kind of a tight fit. Hello? Operator?

12:31.166 --> 12:34.417
Pirates have taken over the cliff guns.
Notify the coast guard.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.458
Hello, hello!

12:36.542 --> 12:38.750
[telephone operator]
<i>Deposit five cents, please.</i>

12:38.834 --> 12:42.250
Oh, anyone got change for a dollar?

12:42.417 --> 12:43.875
I got a nickel.

12:44.041 --> 12:46.625
[grunting] I'm lacking maneuverability.

12:46.709 --> 12:51.208
-Can you help me, Barney?
-Sure, no problem.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.583
I've seen it a million times.

12:53.750 --> 12:54.750
[Barney] Oops!

12:54.834 --> 12:56.166
I'll get it.

12:57.041 --> 13:01.000
I can't see it. Move your size 14s, Baloo.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.750
Where to?

13:03.041 --> 13:06.000
[Baloo and Barney grunting]

13:06.208 --> 13:09.500
Uh-oh. We got company coming, cuz.

13:15.291 --> 13:18.959
You know,
that goat is beginning to get my goat.

13:22.125 --> 13:24.500
Where's the nickel?
Where's the phone booth?

13:24.625 --> 13:25.750
Where's Barney?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
[Barney] I'm right here!

13:29.583 --> 13:33.250
I got the nickel, but the phone's dead.

13:33.417 --> 13:36.750
You think the coast guard
will stop those pirates?

13:36.834 --> 13:41.917
We're the only two who know
those guns are gonna be silent.

13:42.542 --> 13:45.458
I guess it's up to us to fix that.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.625
You boys keep going. I'll catch up.

13:48.792 --> 13:52.208
Don't worry, Barney.
We'll come back for you.

13:52.375 --> 13:53.583
I hope.

13:55.959 --> 13:59.208
OK, let's crack this mountain!

14:07.792 --> 14:11.625
Ooh! Ooh! Watch this. Bomb bowling!

Hey! ;laughing] This mountain climbing
ain't so bad.

14:28.875 --> 14:32.458
Yeah, except
for the mountain part... [grunts]

14:32.542 --> 14:34.792
And the climbing. [grunts]

14:34.917 --> 14:37.333
Ow! And the falling rocks.

14:37.792 --> 14:39.750
[Mad Dog, Hal and Dumptruck laughing]

14:39.834 --> 14:43.291
Sounds like we're real close.
Climb this way.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.583
[grunting]

14:52.458 --> 14:57.834
We got to talk to the boss
about a raise. We deserve one.

14:57.917 --> 15:01.417
[Dumptruck] Yeah. We do the looting,
and he gets all the loot.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.875
It ain't fair.

15:03.041 --> 15:04.500
They're right above us.

15:04.583 --> 15:08.375
I don't even own a lousy pair of boots.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.792
Why, I'm tired of being stepped on!

15:12.875 --> 15:15.458
-Yow!
-[Hal and Dumptruck] Huh?

15:16.959 --> 15:20.709
[laughs] Nice of you to drop by.

15:20.792 --> 15:22.834
Now drop dead!

15:24.875 --> 15:26.208
[both laughing]

15:26.667 --> 15:28.250
-Not again!
-Not again!

15:29.083 --> 15:31.166
[Louie and Baloo screaming]

15:33.500 --> 15:36.875
[Louie and Baloo screaming]

15:37.041 --> 15:42.500
-You boys need a lift?
-We're sure glad to see you, Barney.

15:42.667 --> 15:46.667
Lookie! Somebody threw away
a perfectly good aerialplane.

15:46.750 --> 15:52.000
-You can fly?
-No, but I seen it done a million times.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.000
[Barney] Hey!

15:55.750 --> 16:00.709
-How do you steer this thing?
-Push the lever, gently!

16:01.709 --> 16:04.083
Whoa!

16:04.250 --> 16:05.875
[all scream]

16:09.417 --> 16:10.709
[crash]

16:13.875 --> 16:17.083
Whew! That was some stunt, Barney!

16:17.417 --> 16:21.375
I should have stayed in bed this morning!

16:24.875 --> 16:26.583
What happened to the ammo?

16:27.125 --> 16:29.750
There are only three shells left.

16:29.917 --> 16:32.959
That's enough for three big holes.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.750
Hey! My baby!

16:38.166 --> 16:40.208
Here, Baloo.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.583
I'm going with my Duck.
Barney, grab those shells.

16:43.667 --> 16:44.834
You know what to do.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.709
Yessiree...
Worked on that gun for 50 years,

16:51.792 --> 16:54.959
polishing that barrel every day.

16:55.125 --> 16:58.792
-You never fired it?
-No. I seen it done.

16:58.959 --> 17:01.166
[both] Yeah, yeah. A million times!

17:01.250 --> 17:02.417
[both scream]

17:02.583 --> 17:04.666
Don't worry, boys! I'll handle it!

17:11.666 --> 17:14.458
You think old Barney
can handle those guns?

17:14.541 --> 17:17.834
Well, he never climbed a mountain

17:17.916 --> 17:20.000
or flew a plane before.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.208
We're in big trouble!

17:25.250 --> 17:28.750
Labor day! Labor day! No, no... Arbor day!

17:28.834 --> 17:30.500
No, wait. Uh...

17:30.583 --> 17:33.083
Mayday! That's it! Mayday!

17:33.250 --> 17:35.083
[Don Karnage over radio] <i>What do you want?</i>

17:35.291 --> 17:37.542
Open up. It's an emergency!

17:37.625 --> 17:40.917
-[knocking]
-Hold on. Someone's at the door.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.041
Who is it?

17:44.125 --> 17:48.417
-Repossession company.
-We're here to collect!

17:51.959 --> 17:53.375
Oops! Too late!

18:00.834 --> 18:04.041
What would you possibly
come back here to ask me?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.709
Can you open the hatch?

18:06.917 --> 18:09.834
<i>Sacre bleu </i> cheese! Get them!

18:10.000 --> 18:11.417
Guess that's a no.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.208
Keep going, cuz! I'll open the hatch!

18:19.959 --> 18:22.917
Barney, old boy, don't let us down now!

18:28.250 --> 18:30.375
[grunts] Now let's see here.

18:30.458 --> 18:34.166
This one raises the barrel. That's it.

18:34.333 --> 18:37.625
This one must turn it back and-- Yeah.

18:37.709 --> 18:41.208
And this-- I'll bet this one fires it.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.000
Oops.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.792
Why are those three imbeciles
making the gun go boom-boom?

18:50.959 --> 18:54.834
That's one. Come on, Barney.
Get something right just this once.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.750
[speaking gibberish]

19:02.000 --> 19:03.959
No, that ain't it.

19:11.208 --> 19:15.875
Time to make Baloo black and blue!

19:15.959 --> 19:17.750
Some other time, champ.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.375
Do I have to do everything myself?

19:23.375 --> 19:24.709
[yells]

19:27.166 --> 19:28.542
[guns cocking]

19:28.917 --> 19:31.667
I knew I should have read
my horoscope this morning.

19:31.834 --> 19:32.875
Louie!

19:37.792 --> 19:41.208
What are you doing here?
Where are the others?

19:41.291 --> 19:45.834
-They fell down.
-Who fired the gun?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.291
[Barney] Let's see... A little higher,

19:48.375 --> 19:50.083
a little to the left...

19:50.208 --> 19:53.917
There! That ought to do it!
Now I'll load the gun.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.250
Well, gun gone in.

19:59.375 --> 20:02.458
How can I hit something if it's moving?

20:02.667 --> 20:06.125
Listen, Karney,
that first shot was a warning.

20:06.208 --> 20:11.041
Release Louie and turn back,
or the next one blows this bird!

20:11.125 --> 20:14.041
[shell whistles]

20:14.208 --> 20:15.500
[shell explodes]

20:15.625 --> 20:20.000
Ha! He is the worst shot
I have ever heard in my life.

20:20.166 --> 20:21.500
It was worth a try.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.583
In mere moments,

20:23.667 --> 20:27.542
Cape Suzette shall be
a bargain hunters paradise--

20:27.709 --> 20:31.291
Free money, free jewels,
free seafood dinners!

20:34.875 --> 20:36.500
The last shell.

20:39.792 --> 20:42.250
Oh, darn! It got stuck!

20:42.333 --> 20:44.083
Aah!

20:47.250 --> 20:48.750
Oh, shucks!

20:49.834 --> 20:53.500
-Shot three.
-Yeah. Barney blew it.

20:57.542 --> 21:00.667
Now I can truly say with confidence,

21:00.750 --> 21:03.875
today Cape Suzette, tomorrow--

21:04.125 --> 21:05.375
[blast]

21:09.333 --> 21:11.375
Well, blow my nose!

-I did it!
-He did it?

21:15.166 --> 21:18.000
[Don Karnage]
Turn around! Head for the castle!

21:35.166 --> 21:36.458

21:37.959 --> 21:40.458
[Barney laughing]

21:43.333 --> 21:46.834
Ahem. I propose a toast

21:47.166 --> 21:50.834
to us, three of the bravest
mountain climbers I know.

21:51.208 --> 21:54.291
-Yeah!
-I'll drink to that!

21:55.417 --> 21:58.542
[Baloo] Say, Barney...
I've been meaning to ask you.

21:58.625 --> 22:03.458
You worked on those guns for 50 years,
but never climbed a mountain.

22:03.625 --> 22:05.792
How did you get to work?

22:06.041 --> 22:08.041
Why, I took the elevator.
