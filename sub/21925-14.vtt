WEBVTT

00:12.011 --> 00:13.972
<i>Previously on </i>Star Trek: Discovery<i>:</i>

00:14.055 --> 00:15.640
What is happening to you?

00:15.724 --> 00:19.936
I don't think I'm Ash Tyler, Starfleet
lieutenant. Not really. Not anymore.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.981
<i>We modified Voq into a shell</i>
<i>that appears human.</i>

00:23.064 --> 00:25.608
<i>We grafted his psyche into Tyler's.</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:29.738
I do not know where your Voq ends
and our Tyler begins,

00:29.821 --> 00:31.489
<i>but they are both in jeopardy.</i>

00:32.490 --> 00:34.951
Only my hands can tend to him.

00:39.956 --> 00:43.084
Logic tells me
she's not the woman that I betrayed.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.002
She's a ghost.

00:48.798 --> 00:52.510
I have no future now. Find a way home.
I will buy you some time.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.179
Get her out of there now.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.312
What have you done to me?

01:02.395 --> 01:04.397
If we blow the reactor core,

01:04.481 --> 01:07.358
<i>the resulting explosion</i>
<i>will be pure mycelial energy.</i>

01:07.442 --> 01:10.487
<i>We can ride it long enough</i>
<i>for the energy to activate the drive,</i>

01:10.570 --> 01:13.031
<i>and then you can navigate us home.</i>

01:15.575 --> 01:18.787
We overshot by nine months.

01:18.870 --> 01:23.249
If the map is to be believed,
it appears the Klingons have won the war.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.514
Captain.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.432
Emperor.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.898
-On your knees, slave.
-This Kelpien is my captain.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.319
Sir, I can explain.

01:51.402 --> 01:55.198
Yesterday we dined on the entrails
of his brethren,

01:55.532 --> 01:57.867
and today you seek his favor?

01:59.744 --> 02:04.040
Transport our visitor to guest quarters
on deck three, and confine her there now.

02:09.754 --> 02:12.757
You told me there were no Kelpiens
in the other universe. You lied.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.843
I hoped to spare you the pain.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.682
The presence of a Terran defector
on this ship is classified.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.101
Its utterance will carry a penalty
of treason.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.811
-Aye, Captain.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.940
<i>Captain,</i>
<i>your presence is requested in sickbay.</i>

02:30.024 --> 02:31.067
With me.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.238
I could offer excuses.

02:35.864 --> 02:39.951
I... was trying to destabilize
the Terran Empire.

02:40.034 --> 02:44.789
I... I thought Starfleet could benefit
from learning about an alternate universe.

02:45.582 --> 02:50.128
Truth is, I couldn't watch her die again.
I wanted to offer her more.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.213
I am sorry.

02:52.672 --> 02:56.885
Saving Georgiou may indeed prove
to be a grave error in judgment, but...

02:58.845 --> 03:02.265
no one else could've done what you did
aboard that Terran flagship.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.225
You are alive and we are home.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.272
Any news from Command?

03:09.564 --> 03:13.026
Federation ships have appeared on sensors,
but none answer my hail.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.069
Doesn't feel much like home.

03:16.738 --> 03:20.575
<i>Discovery </i>suffered damage riding
the shockwave back into our universe.

03:20.658 --> 03:24.454
We are running on auxiliary power
until repairs are complete. Deck four.

03:27.582 --> 03:32.253
Dr. Pollard has orders to alert me when
Lieutenant Tyler regains consciousness.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.885
An emergency surgical procedure
proved necessary.

03:40.178 --> 03:45.266
An attempt to excise the Klingon
in Tyler's neurological identity.

03:45.683 --> 03:50.230
How? What happened to him was completely
outside the realm of sanctioned medicine.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.523
Starfleet did not perform the procedure.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.902
It was the Klingon, L'Rell.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.072
-His torturer.
-And handler.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.325
She oversaw Tyler's transformation.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.079
None of us are sure
what state we might find him in.

04:06.704 --> 04:12.669
I am hoping that a familiar face
could offer him encouragement to heal.

04:13.461 --> 04:19.550
How he reacts to you may offer us insight
into who he has become.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.678
Captain, he's awake.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.097
Is that an order, Captain?

04:25.098 --> 04:28.643
-I fail to understand.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.270
No.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.940
I'm sorry. I can't.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.659
What are your findings, Doctor?

04:44.742 --> 04:48.037
By all assessments,
the patient now presents as Ash Tyler.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.790
Adrenocorticotropic hormonal levels
are normal.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.751
Cellular mitochondria counts
are back within human range.

04:53.835 --> 04:57.755
I find no remaining evidence
of Klingon aggression or muscular stamina.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.509
So, is he human or Klingon?

05:01.592 --> 05:03.886
Neither

05:04.470 --> 05:05.596
We can't be sure.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.350
Not without understanding the science
behind the reassignment procedure.

05:09.600 --> 05:13.771
-I suppose we could start by asking him.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.151
<i>Ensign Taylor to the command deck.</i>

05:22.905 --> 05:23.740
Tyler.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.785
Mr. Saru.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.164
Thanks for the save.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.166
And Voq?

05:36.919 --> 05:40.923
I can access his memories,
but there's a disconnect,

05:41.174 --> 05:44.427
like I'm watching someone else's life
or something.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.721
Do you remember what was done to you?

05:54.062 --> 05:55.938
The Mo'Kai call it a choH'a'.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.776
Species reassignment protocol.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.696
Specifically designed to infiltrate
classified Starfleet intelligence.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.866
-Voq was the test case.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.370
They flayed his skin...

06:12.955 --> 06:14.415
cracked his bones open...

06:16.459 --> 06:18.044
sawed his heart into pieces.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.298
You think that'll be the worst of it...

06:23.800 --> 06:25.718
then they shave down the tips
of your fingers.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.057
Voq was T'Kuvma's Torchbearer.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.353
He submitted to the torture willingly
at L'Rell's behest.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.856
They were the only true believers left.

06:39.857 --> 06:44.362
Voq and L'Rell believed taking this ship
would bring followers to T'Kuvma's house.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.657
They were in love, you know.

06:49.909 --> 06:50.743
Uh...

06:53.454 --> 06:57.083
Will you cooperate with us,
share everything you know?

06:57.166 --> 06:58.167
Of course.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.173
I would do anything
to undo what I've done.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.053
Is she alive?

07:10.138 --> 07:10.972
Uh...

07:11.472 --> 07:14.934
Specialist Burnham has returned safely
aboard <i>Discovery.</i>

07:19.147 --> 07:20.398
Thank God.

07:21.357 --> 07:24.026
-Focus on your recovery.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.698
-You both survived a harrowing ordeal.
-Saru, I tried to kill her.

07:29.740 --> 07:30.908
I murdered...

07:34.579 --> 07:35.621
Dr. Culber.

07:38.082 --> 07:41.669
-I belong in the brig.
-Voq is responsible for your crimes.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.755
And I see no semblance of him before me.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.557
Your privileges aboard <i>Discovery</i>
will be limited...

07:56.517 --> 07:58.102
but I will not take your freedom.

08:14.535 --> 08:17.038
Vessel is approaching, sir.
Federation signature.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.624
-Hail them at once.
-Aye, Captain.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.669
Captain, its shields are up,
its phasers are charged and targeting.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.546
-Shields up.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.924
I'm picking up an incoming
transporter signature.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.634
We're being boarded.

08:35.389 --> 08:38.184
-Identify yourselves.
-Hands where I can see them.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.186
Get back.
Don't move.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.395
Step away from there!

08:41.479 --> 08:44.440
-I demand an explanation.
-We ask the questions.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.901
-Clear for transport. -Admiral.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.535
-Sarek, please.
-Stand down, Specialist. Now.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.956
Computer, initiate command-level override.

09:00.581 --> 09:04.001
Authorization, Admiral Katrina Cornwell,
pi beta six.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.255
<i>Override confirmed.</i>

09:11.259 --> 09:12.260
Start with him.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.013
Ambassador, what are you doing?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.391
What the times require.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.769
My mind to your mind.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.064
My thoughts to your thoughts.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.371
Mr. Saru is who he appears to be.

09:41.706 --> 09:47.169
The <i>Discovery</i> has been through...
an inconceivable ordeal.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.173
Then where the hell
is her commanding officer?

09:55.261 --> 09:58.556
Captain Lorca... is dead.

11:39.698 --> 11:40.699
Bastard.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.623
The Lorca I came up with was measured,
he was reasoned.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.417
I couldn't have imagined--

11:49.500 --> 11:52.503
That Lorca was an impostor
from an alternate universe

11:52.586 --> 11:54.797
was not the most obvious conclusion.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.133
We were all deceived.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.719
<i>Discovery </i>was destroyed by Klingons
nine months ago.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.597
I saw the debris with my own eyes.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.517
That wreckage belonged
to the Terran <i>Discovery.</i>

12:06.600 --> 12:09.395
The ships switched places
when we jumped universes.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.230
From what you've told us
about the Terran Empire,

12:11.313 --> 12:14.900
no Starfleet officer
could survive that universe alone.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.403
So, my Gabriel is dead.

12:23.701 --> 12:27.621
Lorca sidelined the most vital asset
in our fleet.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.457
Now, with your return,

12:29.540 --> 12:32.918
we have disseminated
your hard-earned cloak-breaking algorithm

12:33.002 --> 12:34.211
to the front lines,

12:34.295 --> 12:36.672
which will neutralize
the Klingons' ability

12:36.755 --> 12:38.507
to render their ships invisible.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.593
But our fear is it's too late.

12:41.177 --> 12:45.806
The war here has waged on
for nine brutal months without it.

12:47.975 --> 12:54.732
Stardate 4789.6, Klingon vessels launch
hypothermic charges at Kelfour VI,

12:54.815 --> 12:59.695
burning off their atmosphere
and killing 11,000 civilians instantly.

13:00.362 --> 13:06.076
Stardate 4851.5,
a cloaked raider tails the <i>U.S.S. Saratoga</i>

13:06.160 --> 13:08.537
into spacedock at Starbase 22,

13:08.621 --> 13:12.416
then ignites its antimatter supply
in a suicide mission.

13:12.750 --> 13:17.421
Days later, similar assaults
are carried out on bases 19 and 12,

13:17.922 --> 13:20.633
resulting in the loss
of one-third of our fleet.

13:21.425 --> 13:26.013
Research outposts at the border colonies
of Nivalla, Septra, and Iridin

13:26.597 --> 13:27.973
have also been destroyed.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.685
The only children spared are now orphans.

13:35.272 --> 13:39.193
There's no pattern to these attacks,
no logical progression to their targets.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.237
There's not even consistency of method.

13:41.737 --> 13:45.783
In the absence of a clear leader,
the Klingon houses are divided again.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.953
At the start of this war,
we fought one enemy.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.580
Now, we fight 24.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.291
They quarrel among themselves,

13:54.375 --> 13:57.378
hence the indiscriminate nature
of their aggression,

13:57.461 --> 14:00.422
but their collective aim seems clear:

14:01.382 --> 14:02.883
to compete for dominance

14:02.967 --> 14:06.637
by seeing which house can destroy
the most Federation assets.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.182
We are fodder for their feudal savagery.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.852
Our deaths, their spoils.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.524
Nearly 20 percent of former
Federation space has been occupied.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.862
<i>Discovery </i>will jump to Starbase I
immediately.

14:23.279 --> 14:27.241
All evidence of your recent journey
will be classified and destroyed.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.828
We cannot risk the knowledge
of this alternate universe

14:30.911 --> 14:34.081
-leaving the confines of <i>Discovery.</i>
-I don't understand.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.792
There would be too many possibilities.

14:36.876 --> 14:37.877
Indeed.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.671
Our people have suffered terrible losses.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.426
What would you do if you thought
that your dead wife, your lost child,

14:45.509 --> 14:49.471
your murdered parents all might be alive
on the other side

14:49.555 --> 14:54.059
and that a technology exists
for you to see them again?

14:55.477 --> 14:58.147
This knowledge must be buried.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.816
Command will want this locked down.

15:01.358 --> 15:03.235
Of course, Admiral.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.405
Starbase I
is our only remaining sanctuary.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.198
Can you jump us there?

15:08.282 --> 15:11.410
Well, it's, uh, 100 AU's from Earth

15:11.493 --> 15:13.996
and over a light-year
from our current position.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.374
We used up our supply of spores
to get us home,

15:17.458 --> 15:20.377
and I can't jump without them.

15:22.838 --> 15:27.176
The journey at warp will be perilous.
Klingons swarm the quadrant.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.512
I'm afraid we have no choice.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.683
Saru, take the ship to warp
as soon as possible.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.102
Admiral...

15:38.145 --> 15:40.481
there's one more thing you need to know.

15:46.070 --> 15:50.908
Emperor, the Federation has questions.
I need you to answer them.

15:51.575 --> 15:56.288
What kind of guest would I be
if I refused such a simple request?

15:56.914 --> 16:00.709
I'm told that, in your universe,
your word is law.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.505
-Here, we do things differently.
-I can see that.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.841
The resemblance is remarkable.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.721
What do you know of your counterpart,
Captain Philippa Georgiou?

16:15.683 --> 16:20.396
I know that she is dead, and I am not.

16:20.813 --> 16:26.360
But I will leave you to determine
which of us has proved stronger.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.156
Specialist Burnham has assured us

16:31.240 --> 16:34.868
that your arrival in this universe
is without motive.

16:35.869 --> 16:38.664
But your presence here
remains complicated.

16:38.747 --> 16:40.833
The solution, however, is not.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.252
Send me home.

16:43.335 --> 16:46.505
The emperor narrowly escaped
a violent revolution.

16:47.923 --> 16:51.343
-She deserves political asylum.
-I don't need your protection.

16:51.427 --> 16:55.639
We have charted a course for Starbase I.
You will be held there humanely

16:55.723 --> 16:58.517
until Command can determine
a proper course of action.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.269
So I <i>am</i> your prisoner.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.063
Look, Your Highness,
or whatever you're called,

17:03.147 --> 17:04.898
I'll tell it to you straight.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.526
I'm not even sure
we know how to send you home,

17:07.609 --> 17:10.029
and even if we did,
we have a war to fight.

17:11.071 --> 17:16.201
I'm sorry. Like I said, you're our guest.
Make yourself at home.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.041
The resemblance is remarkable.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.128
See that she's comfortable.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.898
<i> Attention all cadets.</i>

17:45.981 --> 17:48.358
<i>Duty roster is updated</i>
<i>to reflect new rotations,</i>

17:48.442 --> 17:49.818
<i>effective immediately.</i>

17:50.319 --> 17:51.236
Stamets.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.864
I'm sorry.

17:55.657 --> 17:59.161
Words... Words are not enough,
and I know that...

18:00.537 --> 18:01.497
but I am.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.458
You killed a good man.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.794
A man that I loved. Do you remember that?

18:12.508 --> 18:14.468
-I do now.
-And...

18:15.969 --> 18:17.387
does it gut you?

18:18.138 --> 18:19.431
Does it sicken you?

18:22.726 --> 18:23.560
Good.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.815
Maybe you're still human after all.

19:09.439 --> 19:10.274
Excuse me.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.041
You don't have to do this. I'm okay.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.420
How could that possibly be true?

19:34.882 --> 19:37.217
Just eat, and talk if you want to.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.428
I'm here.

19:50.147 --> 19:50.981
Welcome back.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.628
Admiral. Starbase I within range.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.046
Well done, all.

20:14.129 --> 20:18.300
<i>U.S.S. Discovery</i> to Starbase I,
permission to initiate docking procedures.

20:18.592 --> 20:23.347
-She'll be a sight for sore eyes.
-Admiral, I'm unable to establish contact.

20:24.139 --> 20:25.474
Reset our channels.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.018
I'll override the comms restrictions
manually. -Detmer, drop us out of warp.
-Aye, Admiral.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.822
-Bring Starbase I on-screen.
-Aye, Admiral.

20:51.833 --> 20:52.668
No.

21:00.884 --> 21:01.885
Enhancing image.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.723
That's a Klingon crest.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.769
-House D'Ghor.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.063
-Scan for life signs, now.
Complying.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.900
-Sensing 274 Klingon life signs aboard.
-Federation life.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.361
Negative, Admiral. There's nothing.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.073
There were 80,000 souls on that base.

21:24.241 --> 21:28.412
A large contingent of our leadership
and at least three starships.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.747
The Klingons are practically
in Earth's backyard.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.541
Captain, we're being scanned.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.008
-Maximum warp. Get us out of here.
-Yes, sir.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.139
Long-range sensors to maximum.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.599
Maintain constant scans
of Klingon contacts.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.700
Admiral, <i>Discovery</i> awaits your orders.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.123
Maintain current course and speed.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.002
We will make contact with Command.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.297
What's left of them.

22:50.452 --> 22:51.369
You live.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.872
And you finally made it aboard
the <i>U.S.S. Discovery,</i>

22:53.955 --> 22:57.751
though I suspect you found
the accommodations lacking.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.796
Even from a cage, Kahless hears my call.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.298
I do not subscribe to your ideals...

23:04.424 --> 23:08.428
and yet I feel as though you and I...
understand each other.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.431
T'Kuvma taught that all humans
are without courage.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.643
About this, he was wrong.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.188
I wanna be truthful with you.

23:19.439 --> 23:20.649
Your side is winning.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.904
When we met,
you had nothing but contempt

23:25.987 --> 23:28.532
for the crumbling leadership
of the Klingon Empire.

23:28.615 --> 23:32.160
T'Kuvma sought to strengthen
and unify the Great Houses.

23:32.244 --> 23:36.248
If he has succeeded in only this,
it is cause for celebration.

23:36.331 --> 23:41.962
Your "Great Houses" are carving up
Federation assets among their factions.

23:42.045 --> 23:45.841
A captured starbase
bears the insignia of House D'Ghor,

23:46.258 --> 23:48.343
not of the Klingon Empire.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.097
Is that the kind of unity
your messiah proclaimed?

23:52.681 --> 23:57.060
They think nothing of collateral damage
caused by their brutal attacks.

23:57.144 --> 24:01.106
They target civilians, hospitals,
food convoys.

24:01.439 --> 24:05.777
They slaughter innocents
and inspire terror across the quadrant.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.989
This is war,
not a child's game with rules.

24:09.447 --> 24:11.992
We fight to preserve Klingon identity.

24:12.075 --> 24:15.245
No one is looking to destroy your culture.

24:15.328 --> 24:18.957
Our laws are founded in equality, freedom.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.252
T'Kuvma taught us
that the Federation cannot help itself.

24:22.335 --> 24:25.672
It seeks universal homogenization
and assimilation.

24:25.755 --> 24:28.216
T'Kuvma was an ignorant fool.

24:29.467 --> 24:34.264
And your people are moving closer
and closer to my home planet.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.808
What are you looking for?

24:37.893 --> 24:42.981
More territory
Your people won't even make demands. Why?

24:43.732 --> 24:45.984
How does this war end?

24:47.402 --> 24:48.236
It doesn't.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.364
Klingons have tasted your blood.

24:51.781 --> 24:52.866
Conquer us...

24:54.451 --> 24:56.203
or we will never relent.

24:59.873 --> 25:00.707
Thank you.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.681
There's been a change of plans.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.017
Another Klingon attack.

25:20.143 --> 25:23.855
-You have to stay onboard a little longer.
-It makes no difference.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.025
One cell in this universe
is as good as another.

25:27.108 --> 25:29.903
-You heard your admiral.
-We mean you no harm.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.156
-The admiral--
-Tell me about the Vulcan.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.493
-There is a connection between you.

25:36.576 --> 25:39.788
The way you look at him
is not unlike the way you look at me.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.666
He's essentially my father. He raised me.

25:43.917 --> 25:48.922
-So, you were orphaned here as well.
-Another echo of fate between our worlds.

25:49.714 --> 25:54.219
Your rule extends through every system
in your galaxy.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.515
You've conquered places
Starfleet hasn't dared to explore.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.686
I see now that the time for peace
has passed.

26:04.271 --> 26:08.775
I need you to tell me,
how did you defeat the Klingon Empire?

26:12.570 --> 26:15.907
I started this war,
and I need to finish it.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.701
Why did you bring me here?

26:18.618 --> 26:19.494
Truly.

26:20.453 --> 26:23.415
I wanted to show you a place of morality,
of hope.

26:23.748 --> 26:27.002
Let me tell you,
daughter who is not my daughter,

26:27.752 --> 26:32.173
in truth, you wished to save me
because you couldn't save her.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.927
This regret that you have
for what you did,

26:36.511 --> 26:38.221
it weakens you.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.559
I feel it every day of my life.

26:53.111 --> 26:57.699
The Klingons are like cancer cells,
constantly dividing.

26:59.034 --> 27:04.247
To root them out,
you must destroy the tumor at its source.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.209
How much do you know about Qo'noS?

27:14.257 --> 27:17.218
I suppose I don't have to tell you
it's the middle of the night.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.179
I have a proposal.

27:22.974 --> 27:26.561
I left <i>Discovery </i>only to learn
that a Klingon attack is imminent.

27:26.644 --> 27:30.273
They are gathering forces
to launch a strike on this whole system.

27:30.357 --> 27:35.987
The Klingons are taking the fight to us.
We need to take it to them. To Qo'noS.

27:36.446 --> 27:39.991
Not a simple attack.

27:40.075 --> 27:43.953
A simultaneous strike
on their planetary defense batteries,

27:44.037 --> 27:46.623
immediately followed
by the coordinated destruction of all military targets planet-wide.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.128
A single offensive so destructive

27:52.212 --> 27:56.466
it will force the enemy to retreat
from Federation space and head for home.

27:56.549 --> 28:00.470
Our remaining fleet is being called back
to defend Earth.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.597
<i>Discovery </i>should join them.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.975
Each path of logic leads
to the same conclusion:

28:06.559 --> 28:08.686
Starfleet tactics have failed us.

28:09.521 --> 28:13.149
We must adapt
if we're to have any hope of survival.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.151
Qo'noS is uncharted territory.

28:15.735 --> 28:18.321
We have no idea
where their defense batteries are,

28:18.405 --> 28:20.740
much less weapon-production systems
or shipyards.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.785
The planet's dense
upper atmosphere prevents

28:23.868 --> 28:26.496
long-range topographical
and energy analysis.

28:26.579 --> 28:29.749
No Starfleet officer has set foot there
in this century.

28:29.833 --> 28:33.628
Your strategy is a good one,
but it's not feasible without a map.

28:33.711 --> 28:36.881
By the time <i>Discovery</i> got close enough
to begin surveying,

28:36.965 --> 28:38.341
they'd blow her out of the sky.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.512
She's not gonna be in the sky.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.431
<i>Let's go over it again.</i>

28:44.931 --> 28:48.101
Qo'noS is composed
of a subterranean series

28:48.184 --> 28:50.019
of now-dormant volcanoes.

28:50.478 --> 28:51.938
It is a planet of caves.

28:52.313 --> 28:55.108
Some of them,
according to Specialist Burnham's intel,

28:55.191 --> 28:57.902
are big enough to house
a Crossfield-class starship.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.904
Rather than surveil targets from orbit,

28:59.988 --> 29:02.741
we can map the terrain
from the inside out.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.744
Thereby minimizing our risk of detection.

29:05.827 --> 29:09.664
Jumping a massive starship
inside a cave of impenetrable rock

29:09.748 --> 29:12.208
does seem... challenging.

29:12.292 --> 29:15.128
Travel aboard
the mycelial network is in itself

29:15.211 --> 29:18.923
a sort of advanced detection system
of geophysical imaging.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.676
I can easily identify the voids in energy

29:21.760 --> 29:24.929
that would represent a chasm
versus a solid mass.

29:25.180 --> 29:28.308
And once we're in position
within the cave system,

29:28.391 --> 29:32.270
we'll release our surveillance drone
to collect tactical information.

29:32.353 --> 29:33.396
Good.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.983
Because I've assured Starfleet
we can do this.

29:37.317 --> 29:38.693
And by "we," I mean you.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.738
It's a good plan, Specialist.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.490
-Well done.
-Thank you, Admiral.

29:43.573 --> 29:47.452
One question, how do we get the spores
necessary to make the jump?

29:47.535 --> 29:49.162
We'll have to grow them.

29:49.746 --> 29:53.708
My understanding is that your crop
took years to cultivate.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.837
Set a course for the Veda system and...

29:59.923 --> 30:01.090
get ready for a show.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.311
<i>Prototaxites stellaviatori.</i>

30:13.937 --> 30:15.605
My original sample

30:16.231 --> 30:19.776
and the last remaining mycelium
of this strain.

30:21.611 --> 30:25.949
We are headed to an uninhabited
class-four moon in the Veda system.

30:27.033 --> 30:30.703
And if this works...
I might even let you name it.

30:31.079 --> 30:32.664
You're gonna terraform a moon?

30:33.164 --> 30:37.544
Your research on the success of an organic
mycelial harvest was indeterminable--

30:37.627 --> 30:41.422
Straal quashed it.
He wanted to keep the crop captive.

30:42.006 --> 30:45.176
But if ever there was a time to go wild...

30:48.555 --> 30:49.848
Your child is lost.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.517
Do not confuse my ward with yours.

30:52.725 --> 30:55.687
My daughter was a singular example
of brilliance

30:55.770 --> 30:59.440
until one foolish choice doomed her world.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.943
Sound familiar?

31:02.277 --> 31:05.780
If I understand correctly,
my ward saw through the man

31:05.864 --> 31:09.075
who brought down not just your child,
but your empire.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.745
Perhaps best not to make comparisons.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.586
Why have you requested my presence?

31:20.295 --> 31:23.882
You were summoned, Vulcan, for one reason.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.344
I want to help you end this war.

31:28.428 --> 31:32.640
The information you provided Michael
has already proved valuable.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.809
I told her as much as she could handle.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.396
Our daughters are not so unlike after all.

31:43.359 --> 31:48.239
In my world, Qo'noS is little more
than a blackened mass of dust.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.744
The Klingons fight for scraps
and fear certain death.

31:54.037 --> 32:00.126
But it took a great deal more than
a mapping drone in a cave to get there.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.714
You assured Michael
that your plan would prove effective.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.175
And it will, momentarily.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.135
But they will regroup.

32:09.802 --> 32:15.808
Their longing to destroy the symbol
that is Earth runs far too deep.

32:16.601 --> 32:21.522
What if I could show you how to bring them
to their knees once and for all?

32:23.399 --> 32:28.404
The Federation does not subscribe to what
I imagine are Terran methods of combat.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.615
You face annihilation.

32:31.616 --> 32:36.245
Is it not logical to do anything you can
to save the lives of your kind?

32:37.705 --> 32:39.332
Give me what I want...

32:41.042 --> 32:43.711
and I can assure victory
for the Federation.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.508
-Freedom.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.763
I must return to Vulcan.

32:53.846 --> 32:57.266
There are evolving details to the plan
that must be considered.

32:57.350 --> 33:00.478
-I sense you are uneasy.

33:01.437 --> 33:04.315
During my mind-meld with Saru,
I learned of your attachment

33:04.399 --> 33:09.028
to the Klingon spy and what he did to you.
Such events are clearly troubling.

33:09.445 --> 33:10.571
I'm fine, Sarek.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.032
I remain unconvinced.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.245
There is irony here, of course.
The man you fell in love with was Klingon.

33:17.328 --> 33:18.371
He...

33:20.415 --> 33:21.916
I don't know what he was.

33:22.917 --> 33:24.627
There is also grace.

33:26.045 --> 33:29.132
For what greater source of peace exists

33:29.340 --> 33:32.927
than our ability to love our enemy?

33:34.178 --> 33:35.847
I've made foolish choices.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.725
Emotional choices.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.269
Well, you are human.

33:45.732 --> 33:46.899
As is your mother.

33:49.694 --> 33:54.073
There is no telling what any one of us
may do where the heart is concerned.

33:56.659 --> 33:57.910
We are at war.

33:58.911 --> 34:02.331
Logic dictates that each farewell
may be our last.

34:13.676 --> 34:16.554
Do not regret loving someone, Michael.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.948
Admiral Cornwell requested
a status report.

34:36.532 --> 34:39.327
This is the last
of the mycelial transport vessels.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.704
We'll be able to launch
by the time we reach Veda.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.709
I just said goodbye to my father
and it felt different.

34:48.461 --> 34:49.462
Final.

34:52.006 --> 34:54.967
It won't be... right?

34:59.555 --> 35:02.767
Did you ever think,
when you signed up for Starfleet,

35:03.226 --> 35:06.604
that you'd be forced to see war and death?

35:07.396 --> 35:12.110
Death found me when I was a child,
so, yeah, I knew what I was getting into.

35:13.986 --> 35:16.906
I don't think I did. Not really.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.325
Does that make me naive?

35:21.244 --> 35:22.620
It makes you optimistic.

35:29.752 --> 35:32.130
When we were in the Terran universe,
I was reminded

35:32.213 --> 35:35.508
how much a person is shaped
by their environment.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.595
I think the only way we can stop ourselves
from becoming them

35:39.679 --> 35:42.723
is to understand the darkness within us
and fight it.

35:46.519 --> 35:47.645
Tyler needs you.

35:50.398 --> 35:53.526
-I'm told he's doing well.
-Not possible when you've lost

35:53.609 --> 35:57.113
-the person you care about most.
-He killed a Starfleet officer.

35:59.240 --> 36:02.201
And he... He tried to kill me.

36:02.743 --> 36:06.706
And those crimes are reprehensible,
but Tyler is not the person who did that.

36:06.789 --> 36:11.794
At least he's not anymore.
He is something other, someone new.

36:12.378 --> 36:16.674
What we do now, the way that we treat him,
that is who he will become.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.719
I know you still care about him.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.096
I do.

36:22.930 --> 36:24.557
That does not mean I should.

36:25.141 --> 36:29.562
Michael, he's been stripped of his badge,
he'll never fly for Starfleet again.

36:30.646 --> 36:33.774
He'll be lucky if he doesn't end up
in a lab or a cell.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.235
What kind of future can he have?

36:42.700 --> 36:44.118
Say what you have to say.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.329
Even if it's goodbye.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.096
Lieutenant Stamets, your stop.

37:08.351 --> 37:12.104
-Locked and loaded, Admiral.
-Detmer, put her into geostationary orbit.

37:12.396 --> 37:16.025
Locking in, approximately 800 kilometers
above the moon's surface.

37:16.108 --> 37:20.112
Copy that.
Initiating mycelial ejection protocol.

37:34.126 --> 37:36.212
Engaging agri-transport boosters.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.382
Status, Lieutenant Stamets.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.759
<i>Sensors from the terraforming field show</i>

38:23.843 --> 38:29.181
root structures forming
in Zones 922 and 5041.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.477
Ready the EM darts.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.354
<i>Darts calibrated.</i>

38:36.856 --> 38:37.690
Fire.

38:59.462 --> 39:02.631
Come on, kiddos. Come on.

39:40.795 --> 39:43.422
<i>Spore generation at four percent.</i>

39:44.006 --> 39:45.216
<i>Eight percent.</i>

39:45.841 --> 39:47.259
<i>Twelve percent.</i>

39:48.052 --> 39:49.762
<i>Fifteen percent.</i>

39:50.388 --> 39:52.056
<i>Nineteen percent.</i>

39:52.681 --> 39:54.392
<i>Twenty-two percent.</i>

39:54.850 --> 39:56.560
<i>Twenty-seven percent.</i>

39:56.644 --> 40:01.190
I'd congratulate you, Lieutenant...
but I'm afraid the work has just begun.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.235
<i>Forty-seven percent.</i>

40:05.027 --> 40:06.946
<i>Fifty-two percent.</i>

40:30.386 --> 40:32.847
-I don't know where to start.
-I do.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.265
I'm sorry.

40:35.683 --> 40:39.895
I know there's no way I can prove this
to you, but Voq, he's gone.

40:40.312 --> 40:41.313
I believe you.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.403
Was there ever really an Ash Tyler?

40:48.612 --> 40:49.947
Did he love me?

40:50.739 --> 40:51.866
'Cause I loved him.

40:55.911 --> 40:56.954
You lied to me.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.916
You said that if it got to be too much,

41:01.792 --> 41:03.502
that if you couldn't handle it,

41:04.211 --> 41:05.463
you would come to me.

41:06.714 --> 41:07.840
And it did...

41:09.633 --> 41:10.676
and you didn't.

41:11.510 --> 41:14.513
And that wasn't Voq, that was you, Tyler.

41:14.597 --> 41:15.806
Who the hell is Tyler?

41:16.223 --> 41:17.516
You think I know anymore?

41:17.975 --> 41:20.102
You think I have any idea who I am now,
where I belong?

41:20.186 --> 41:21.312
This isn't about a lie.

41:21.395 --> 41:24.315
-You're looking for an excuse to end it.

41:24.398 --> 41:26.192
My crewmates have been kinder
than they need to be.

41:26.275 --> 41:29.028
Why are you, the person who knows me best,

41:29.695 --> 41:31.572
-Stop.

41:31.655 --> 41:34.033
I want you to admit
that you can't do this anymore

41:34.116 --> 41:36.619
because you finally went there
and things got complicated.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.289
Your parents were killed by Klingons,
and you fell in love with one.

41:49.381 --> 41:50.424
Maybe you're right.

41:51.550 --> 41:57.223
I know in my head that you
couldn't be responsible for Voq's actions.

41:59.517 --> 42:03.938
But I felt your hands... around my neck.

42:05.731 --> 42:10.736
And I looked into your eyes,
and I saw how much you wanted to kill me.

42:12.071 --> 42:14.406
The man that I loved wanted me dead.

42:15.741 --> 42:17.660
And no matter how hard I try...

42:19.119 --> 42:23.040
when I look at you now, I see Voq's eyes.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.126
I see him.

42:32.132 --> 42:34.843
The crew may have put it behind them,
but I can't.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.013
I shouldn't be here.

42:40.182 --> 42:46.564
I should be an activated Klingon spy,
behind bars or dead.

42:47.690 --> 42:49.775
Michael, the reason it didn't take,

42:49.858 --> 42:53.821
the reason L'Rell couldn't get through
to me... that was you.

42:55.030 --> 42:56.615
Did Ash Tyler love you?

42:57.449 --> 42:58.534
Hell yes, he did.

43:00.202 --> 43:02.371
And I can't find my way back without you.

43:16.719 --> 43:19.305
We created something beautiful today...

43:21.390 --> 43:23.017
in a desolate wasteland...

43:25.603 --> 43:27.271
that had never seen life.

43:32.484 --> 43:34.737
After the Battle of the Binary Stars...

43:36.780 --> 43:38.282
I was so lost.

43:40.659 --> 43:42.369
I had to sit with myself.

43:43.579 --> 43:45.372
I had to work through it.

43:46.248 --> 43:49.418
I had to crawl my way back.

43:53.172 --> 43:55.883
I'm still not there, but...

43:58.260 --> 43:59.178
I'm trying.

44:02.848 --> 44:04.016
That kind of work...

44:05.934 --> 44:07.269
reclaiming life... it's punishing...

44:14.026 --> 44:15.277
and it's relentless...

44:17.821 --> 44:19.406
and it's solitary.

44:22.201 --> 44:23.077
No, I...

44:28.624 --> 44:29.458
Ash.

44:33.003 --> 44:34.254
It's not easy...

44:36.090 --> 44:37.216
letting you go.

45:01.490 --> 45:03.492
The mycelial bloom was successful.

45:04.326 --> 45:05.994
The spore harvest is underway.

45:06.078 --> 45:09.248
Then the jump to Qo'noS will be possible?

45:09.998 --> 45:11.667
Yes. Imminently.

45:12.251 --> 45:17.005
The Federation Council has been briefed
on our new intelligence from the Terran.

45:17.089 --> 45:18.841
Despite the extraordinary risk,

45:18.924 --> 45:22.177
all are agreed
that we have no choice but to proceed.

45:23.846 --> 45:26.515
Our very existence hangs in the balance.

45:27.599 --> 45:28.725
Then it's time.

45:30.853 --> 45:32.896
Open a shipwide channel.

45:37.985 --> 45:42.489
We have all mourned
the enormous loss of life due to this war.

45:43.031 --> 45:45.075
The acts of violence committed against us

45:45.159 --> 45:49.121
are the acts of a foe without reason,
without honor.

45:49.621 --> 45:51.582
<i>And they will not stop coming after us</i>

45:51.665 --> 45:55.085
<i>in the hopes of destroying</i>
<i>everything we hold dear.</i>

45:55.461 --> 45:59.673
<i>These are desperate times,</i>
<i>and they call on us to do more</i>

45:59.756 --> 46:03.177
<i>than merely protect our people,</i>
<i>defend our borders.</i>

46:04.011 --> 46:06.972
I stand before you with a mission.

46:07.931 --> 46:12.644
At 2100 hours, the <i>U.S.S. Discovery</i>
will jump for the Klingon homeworld

46:13.312 --> 46:18.066
in order to map its surface and isolate
vulnerabilities and military targets.

46:18.859 --> 46:21.528
This... brave team...

46:22.613 --> 46:26.074
will be the first to visit
this inhospitable planet

46:26.658 --> 46:31.038
since Captain Archer and the crew of
the<i> Enterprise NX-01 </i>nearly 100 years ago.

46:31.497 --> 46:36.502
So allow me to introduce you to the person
who will chart your course to Qo'noS.

46:45.260 --> 46:47.095
Captain Philippa Georgiou.

46:48.472 --> 46:49.598
Thank you.

46:52.059 --> 46:55.646
Though long presumed dead,
Captain Georgiou was recently rescued

46:55.729 --> 46:58.732
in a highly classified raid
of a Klingon prison vessel.

46:59.191 --> 47:02.361
She was transported aboard <i>Discovery</i>
with my personal retinue.

47:02.903 --> 47:07.199
The mission to Qo'noS
is a perilous expedition.

47:07.991 --> 47:10.786
And Starfleet is confident
that Captain Georgiou

47:11.036 --> 47:15.499
is uniquely qualified to get you there
and to do what needs to be done.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.710
Specialist Burnham,

47:19.294 --> 47:23.590
I trust that this will be an auspicious
reunion, despite our history.

47:24.633 --> 47:25.884
Now, take your station.

47:29.930 --> 47:32.891
Yes... Captain.
