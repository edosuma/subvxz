00:04.837 --> 00:07.437
Fez, guess what I just got...

00:08.007 --> 00:10.040
The new Village People album !

00:10.698 --> 00:14.416
How many songs can they write about
where men go to massage each other ?!

00:16.274 --> 00:17.963
The navy...

00:18.624 --> 00:20.575
These boys never let me down.

00:22.277 --> 00:24.889
Disco sucks, man.
It's painful to listen to.

00:25.408 --> 00:27.087
It makes me wanna shoot myself.

00:28.043 --> 00:29.856
It's the musical equivalent
of Jackie.

00:32.104 --> 00:33.587
Wow. Look at these guys,

00:33.918 --> 00:38.283
their music is so bad they need to
wear disguises just so people don't
beat the crap out of them.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.139
Oh I heard how in Chicago...

00:41.499 --> 00:43.794
...they made a huge bonfire
of disco records.

00:44.793 --> 00:46.964
Also they cover their hotdogs
in pastrami.

00:48.261 --> 00:49.825
It's freakin' awesome.

00:50.791 --> 00:52.536
Man, we should have our own bonfire.

00:53.104 --> 00:55.295
I'm sick of corporations selling
crap to kids...

00:55.565 --> 00:57.956
...that dumbs them down and makes
them act stupid.

00:58.450 --> 01:00.734
Hey, I can sell beer at the bonfire !

01:01.605 --> 01:03.826
I have tons of old disco records
we can burn.

01:06.762 --> 01:07.779
What ?!

01:08.106 --> 01:09.660
I was young and what did you expect ?

01:09.950 --> 01:10.999
See the hair ?

01:12.375 --> 01:14.607
You guys are aweful.
Disco has been great to me.

01:15.141 --> 01:17.668
Without disco, if I rub my crotch
on a girl it's illegal.

01:19.793 --> 01:21.878
With disco, it's a bar mitsva !

01:23.204 --> 01:26.295
See, disco has given Fez and I some
of our best times together.

01:26.724 --> 01:29.319
Oh, like remember the night when
we beat Johnny and Melina at that dance-off ?

01:29.630 --> 01:31.881
Ah, we kicked their gold-lamÃ© asses !

01:32.217 --> 01:34.796
Oh you know what, I heard that
Johnny is working at a carwash.

01:35.059 --> 01:37.797
Yeah, uhuh, we did that to him !

01:38.780 --> 01:40.076
Jackie be nice...

01:40.966 --> 01:43.002
Car wash... he's poor !

01:45.264 --> 01:46.794
You see that, see,

01:47.044 --> 01:50.988
we got a trophy and and the satisfaction
of learning that we ruined two peoples lives.

01:51.532 --> 01:54.078
So you can have your little bonfire,
but we're not going.

01:54.518 --> 01:55.235
Yeah...

01:55.859 --> 01:58.139
I'm going to Weight Watchers
to pick up women.

01:59.952 --> 02:02.394
The thin ones are great but
they have low self-esteem.

02:03.171 --> 02:05.943
That way, you get a hot chick
for fat girls prices !

02:07.392 --> 02:09.358
Wait, wait, Fez.
Hey, maybe we should go.

02:09.358 --> 02:11.317
You know, and defend the music
that we love.

02:11.546 --> 02:12.379
As a team.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.415
Sure, what the hell.

02:15.038 --> 02:16.673
Weight Watcher meetings will
always be there.

02:17.499 --> 02:18.954
God bless the dairy state.

02:20.578 --> 02:22.223
We never run out of fat girls.

02:26.571 --> 02:27.820
Pretty clever there, Jackie.

02:28.170 --> 02:31.720
Using a disco bonfire as a way to
cozy up next to the guy you secretly love.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.380
You know it kinda reminds me of a song...

02:35.384 --> 02:38.384
<i>Jackie loves the foreign boy,
ola, taco !</i>

02:39.734 --> 02:43.299
Look, I am not gonna sit back and
let Fez try to pick up other women.

02:43.672 --> 02:45.141
Much less fat chicks.

02:46.218 --> 02:47.766
Yeah, I mean maybe if we go together,

02:48.187 --> 02:49.736
he'll see that we're perfect
for each other.

02:50.360 --> 02:51.570
So, I'm coming.

02:51.830 --> 02:54.548
Fine. But if you get in the way
of me setting things on fire,

02:55.444 --> 02:56.739
you're getting set on fire.

03:00.957 --> 03:04.969
That '70s Show - 8x18 - We will rock you

03:38.485 --> 03:42.202
Red, I invited the new neighbours
over for coffee and cookies.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.953
That way I can bad-mouth the rest
of the block before they do it to me.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.193
Kitty, I don't wanna meet
new neighbours.

03:49.581 --> 03:52.454
I had to wait twelve years for
the old ones to croak.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.891
Always wanted to talk and
say "Helloooo".

04:00.569 --> 04:01.785
Dumbasses.

04:04.033 --> 04:06.219
Oh, okay they're here.
Now, be nice.

04:06.673 --> 04:10.266
I haven't met the wife yet, but
the husband Josh was very sweet.

04:10.507 --> 04:16.048
He's a car salesman and he told me
he could give me a great deal on
a ?? just because he likes me.

04:18.579 --> 04:21.579
Although he has to go and ask
his supervisor first.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.757
Hello Josh !

04:31.330 --> 04:33.260
Hi Kitty. Good to see you again !

04:34.071 --> 04:35.289
This is Jeff.

04:38.221 --> 04:42.071
- Hi Jeff ! Where's your wife ?
- You're looking at her !

04:43.580 --> 04:47.005
The only lady in my life is my
little palmorini, Tina Louise.

04:47.334 --> 04:51.539
Who is going to the pound if she
doesn't stop humping my cowboy boots.

04:53.035 --> 04:55.221
We are not having this conversation here...

04:56.470 --> 04:58.018
Okay, well I'm confused.

05:02.007 --> 05:07.512
So, you two live together but I
only saw the movers bringing in one bed.

05:12.207 --> 05:14.073
Ohhhh...

05:16.863 --> 05:17.960
Well...

05:19.674 --> 05:22.051
Congratulations !

05:24.793 --> 05:25.647
Look Red,

05:26.258 --> 05:27.854
the new neighbours are here and...

05:28.254 --> 05:30.021
...they're a couple of fellas...

05:32.863 --> 05:33.772
Wait a second.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.066
- You guys live together ?
- Yep.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.020
- Without any wives of girlfriends ?
- Yep.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.961
- You know what I call guys like you ?!
- Oh dear...

05:42.544 --> 05:44.325
Lucky bastards !

05:53.524 --> 05:55.446
Well, the bonfire looks pretty
sturdy.

05:55.842 --> 05:58.136
But remember, when the flames
get too high,

05:58.509 --> 06:00.700
you saw the foreign kid play
with the matches.

06:03.294 --> 06:06.212
Hey. Who was that girl you were
talking to ?

06:06.542 --> 06:07.729
Oh, Lisa Conner.

06:08.027 --> 06:10.292
A girl I dated a couple of years ago
when I was a camp counselor.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.496
Oh. I never knew you were
a camp counselor.

06:12.712 --> 06:13.781
It didn't last too long.

06:13.781 --> 06:15.903
Apparently, going out on a
canoe trip with six kids...

06:15.903 --> 06:19.075
...and coming back with five
is a big no-no.

06:20.824 --> 06:22.388
Hey man.
How much for a beer ?

06:22.791 --> 06:23.875
One dollar.

06:23.875 --> 06:24.915
Awesome.

06:25.665 --> 06:26.719
There you go.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.136
Now, if you want it in a cup,
that's an extra three bucks.

06:31.073 --> 06:33.733
Oh, and there's a two dollar
pouring charge.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.890
You want six bucks for a beer ?!

06:36.792 --> 06:38.120
You can always go to the other place.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.030
There is no other place.

06:41.089 --> 06:42.215
Whadayaknow...

06:44.260 --> 06:46.829
Looks like I got what you call
a monopoly.

06:48.481 --> 06:49.563
You have change for a ten ?

06:50.307 --> 06:51.262
Nope.

06:53.748 --> 06:55.308
There he is officer !

06:55.730 --> 07:00.137
Here's the guy who is responsible for
this illegal gathering of dirty and ugly people.

07:02.027 --> 07:04.359
These two tell me you organised
an illegal bonfire ?

07:06.246 --> 07:07.721
You two narked on me ?

07:07.721 --> 07:09.560
What ?

07:12.668 --> 07:15.374
You stand there and accuse me
of narking ?!

07:16.501 --> 07:18.876
No sir, no, I did not nark.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.482
What's nark ?

07:24.100 --> 07:25.263
Calling the cops.

07:25.762 --> 07:27.206
Oh yes we narked.

07:28.456 --> 07:29.500
That's right Steven.

07:29.747 --> 07:32.359
Because Fez and I both feel that
burning disco records is wrong.

07:32.856 --> 07:36.140
Just like burning books but worse,
because disco tells a story.

07:39.147 --> 07:41.079
This is a disco burning bonfire ?

07:42.171 --> 07:44.517
That's fantastic ! Disco sucks !

07:47.816 --> 07:49.381
Ah. What do you know...

07:50.097 --> 07:52.181
Degenerate, cop, having a beer together.

07:53.050 --> 07:55.004
It's a disco-sucking miracle.

08:01.370 --> 08:03.454
You know I'm taking an astronomy
class in college right now.

08:04.246 --> 08:06.558
You see those three stars in
a row right there ?

08:07.048 --> 08:07.463
Uhuh.

08:07.685 --> 08:08.666
That's Virgo.

08:11.154 --> 08:12.621
That's an airplane.

08:14.278 --> 08:16.030
I do not go to a good school.

08:17.545 --> 08:20.020
- Oh my God, Randy ?!
- Linda ?

08:20.333 --> 08:23.459
- Oh my god ! Missy is here too !
- Is she ?

08:23.714 --> 08:25.967
Oh my god ! I'll go get her !

08:28.330 --> 08:29.184
Who was that ?

08:29.591 --> 08:31.829
Uh Linda. I dated her.

08:33.018 --> 08:34.113
And her sister, Missy.

08:35.717 --> 08:38.058
Not together, there was a summer
in between them.

08:39.312 --> 08:40.616
Summer was their cousin...

08:44.249 --> 08:47.439
Wow. I'm dating a man-slut.

08:49.081 --> 08:51.203
Look, I'm sure you dated a lot
of people too.

08:51.456 --> 08:53.741
I mean, if we took all the people I've
dated and all the people you've dated...

08:54.082 --> 08:57.301
- ...and put them in a room together...
- We'd have a room full of girls, and Eric !

09:00.863 --> 09:02.521
What do you guys have against disco ?!

09:02.814 --> 09:04.919
It's the only thing white people
can dance to !

09:07.805 --> 09:10.156
Hey uh, Jackie.

09:11.656 --> 09:15.485
I was thinking of a way to get back
at you, calling the cops and all that.

09:15.780 --> 09:17.595
And then it hit me.
You're only here to get with Fez.

09:17.804 --> 09:22.312
So I figured, why not find the skankiest,
sluttiest, drunkest chick here...

09:23.124 --> 09:25.437
...give her three more beers and
then introduce her to Fez.

09:27.021 --> 09:29.099
- Oh you wouldn't !
- Oh I already did.

09:29.312 --> 09:30.984
- You didn't !
- I just said I did.

09:31.223 --> 09:33.875
- You wouldn't dare !
- I did ! Turn around and look !

09:35.565 --> 09:36.626
Enjoy your evening...

09:38.297 --> 09:41.910
Fez ! Uh, what are you doing ?

09:42.938 --> 09:44.241
It's fantastic !

09:46.962 --> 09:50.787
Every time I say disco sucks, Kelly
sticks her tongue down my throat !

09:52.625 --> 09:54.179
Watch : disco sucks !

09:57.704 --> 09:59.375
It's like a magic trick !

10:01.345 --> 10:03.661
But uhm Fez, you're supposed
to be here with me !

10:04.869 --> 10:07.367
Beside, don't you know about
rocker chicks ?

10:08.254 --> 10:09.845
They all have syfilis.

10:12.283 --> 10:15.459
- Do you have syfilis ?
- Uhm, I don't think so.

10:15.925 --> 10:17.627
That's good enough for me baby !

10:24.254 --> 10:25.881
What a game !

10:26.495 --> 10:29.300
That quarterback's eleven for twelve
with no interception.

10:30.018 --> 10:32.880
- He is hot !
- Ridiculously hot...

10:35.205 --> 10:37.321
Oh, another cookie ?

10:38.222 --> 10:40.005
- What ?
- Nothing.

10:40.308 --> 10:42.458
I just thought we were trying to slim
down for the Bahamas.

10:43.316 --> 10:45.992
Well excuse me
Mr. Two-Scoopes-Of-Sugar...

10:48.005 --> 10:51.716
You guys don't need wives,
you bicker like an old married couple !

10:53.740 --> 10:55.598
Red, I need to talk to you in the kitchen.

10:55.848 --> 10:56.726
Kitty, I'm watching the game...

10:56.726 --> 10:58.849
Ohh fine.

10:59.302 --> 11:03.099
You know I wish there was a bar we
could go to where there'd be no women, just guys.

11:04.911 --> 11:05.869
I know a few...

11:09.503 --> 11:11.088
I am having it !

11:13.351 --> 11:14.622
Okay Kitty, what is it ?

11:15.384 --> 11:18.198
It's about the neighbours,
there is something you should know.

11:18.651 --> 11:19.696
<i>TOUCHDOWN !</i>

11:20.052 --> 11:23.056
Dammit see what you made me miss ?!

11:38.036 --> 11:40.574
Kitty, I think those guys are gay !

11:47.968 --> 11:50.526
Red, you can't hide from Jeff and Josh
all night !

11:51.116 --> 11:51.944
Not all night.

11:52.226 --> 11:54.460
Just till they eat all the cookies
and decide to skip home.

11:57.038 --> 11:59.945
Red Forman !
Our neighbours are gay, so what ?

12:00.539 --> 12:03.308
At least they'll keep the place nice
and our property values will go up.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.351
What am I supposed to say
to them now ?!

12:08.353 --> 12:10.822
You've been talking to them the whole
game, you knew what to say then.

12:11.446 --> 12:13.997
Well that was before I saw them
kissing in my living room !

12:15.320 --> 12:18.158
Didn't bother you last night, when
you saw Abbott kiss Costello.

12:18.728 --> 12:21.912
Well that was different. They had
to do that to fool the landlord.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.507
- Hey Red, can I borrow some socks ?
- No.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.262
Bob, we're having a crisis here.

12:31.541 --> 12:33.352
Our new neighbours are gay !

12:34.915 --> 12:36.197
They're gay ?

12:37.564 --> 12:39.683
Aw great, now they're gonna be
all over me.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.189
What the hell are you talking about ?

12:45.011 --> 12:47.932
I canât explain it.
Men find me attractive.

12:50.715 --> 12:53.855
Yeahâ¦everybody wants a piece
of the Pinci.

12:56.136 --> 12:58.541
Well Red, you canât let them sit
in there all night !

12:59.107 --> 13:00.760
What if they rearrange my furniture ?!

13:02.822 --> 13:05.327
Fine ! Iâllâ¦Iâll â¦talk to them.

13:05.907 --> 13:07.479
Okay, but handle it gracefully !

13:08.202 --> 13:10.781
Well of course I will !
Give me a little credit.

13:12.816 --> 13:14.316
Good night guys !

13:31.849 --> 13:33.752
I have to go throw up again !

13:37.722 --> 13:39.154
Okay...
Hurry back...

13:55.482 --> 13:56.418
Hey Fez !

14:02.138 --> 14:03.829
Village People, what are you doing here ?

14:05.191 --> 14:07.966
We came to put a stop to your disco-bonfire.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.735
Plus my Mom was in Kenosha,
so you knowâ¦

14:12.156 --> 14:13.285
...two birds with one stone.

14:15.641 --> 14:16.670
Can you keep a secret ?

14:17.406 --> 14:18.591
I love disco.

14:19.329 --> 14:21.421
Yeah, Iâm just pretending to hate it
so I can get with girls.

14:22.268 --> 14:24.045
You guys know how that is, right guys ?

14:27.592 --> 14:29.536
So, letâs talk about Jackie.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.693
You two came here together
to defend disco...

14:32.921 --> 14:36.061
...and you abandoned her to make out
with some skank youâre never gonna see again.

14:37.268 --> 14:40.112
- Aaaandâ¦?
- And ?

14:40.471 --> 14:43.193
Itâs wrong. What do we have to do,
spell it out for you ?

14:43.546 --> 14:46.503
Because we can, with carefully
choreographed arm movementsâ¦

14:48.765 --> 14:49.846
Youâre right.

14:50.469 --> 14:52.155
I totally let Jackie down.

14:53.831 --> 14:55.967
You are one wise Indian.

14:57.343 --> 14:59.506
Actually Iâm Puertorican.
This is just a gig.

15:09.687 --> 15:12.130
Okay, Iâm done vomiting.

15:14.110 --> 15:15.718
Wanna finish making out ?

15:16.644 --> 15:19.765
I would love to.
But I canât for two reasons.

15:20.236 --> 15:23.049
One : I have somewhere to be.

15:24.004 --> 15:28.425
And two : you have some spagetthi
right hereâ¦

15:34.850 --> 15:38.298
So it turns out, Randy had dated
every girl here.

15:39.195 --> 15:42.445
I can literally throw a rock and hit
a girl heâs dated.

15:43.363 --> 15:44.711
In fact, earlier I did.

15:45.206 --> 15:46.347
Sheâs gonna need stitches.

15:47.337 --> 15:50.381
Oh, I remember that girl. I sold her
a bandaid for 8 bucks.

15:51.423 --> 15:52.333
Where did you find a bandaid ?

15:52.799 --> 15:54.583
I pulled it off some guy whoâs
passed out.

15:55.926 --> 15:58.425
Donna ! Donna look what I found.
This is Sarah.

15:58.645 --> 16:02.161
A girl Iâve never dated, who I donât
wanna date and who doesnât want
to date me.

16:02.446 --> 16:03.822
- Right Sarah ?
- Thatâs right.

16:04.711 --> 16:06.393
Although you are kinda cute.

16:07.487 --> 16:08.489
Goodbye Sarah.

16:08.708 --> 16:09.895
Would you like to go out sometime ?

16:10.133 --> 16:12.316
- Go away Sarah.
- Call me !

16:14.462 --> 16:15.696
Man, the kegâs tapped.

16:16.691 --> 16:18.383
Looks like everyone took a turn.

16:18.383 --> 16:19.991
Just like with Randy.

16:21.238 --> 16:23.239
Alright. Itâs time to light this bonfire...

16:26.198 --> 16:31.669
Rockers of Point Place !
It is time... for fire !!!

16:33.179 --> 16:35.585
No, Steven no, you canât burn
these records !

16:36.114 --> 16:37.488
Youâre right Jackie, I canât.

16:38.083 --> 16:39.382
Because Iâm too drunk.

16:40.146 --> 16:41.950
Randy ! Come burn these records !

16:42.222 --> 16:45.010
- Stop !
- Fez ? You came back !

16:45.583 --> 16:48.242
Jackie, I need to tell you something,
something about you and me.

16:48.772 --> 16:49.787
Really ?

16:50.150 --> 16:54.038
Yes, this whole time I was off making
out with that girl and all of a sudden
it felt wrong.

16:54.858 --> 16:56.677
- It did ?
- Yes.

16:57.229 --> 16:59.288
I shouldnât have been with her. 
I should have been with you.

17:00.364 --> 17:04.462
Oh my God. Fez, I wanted to hear
that for so long.

17:05.521 --> 17:06.896
Loo- I feel the same way.

17:07.523 --> 17:10.443
I realised something and I want
everyone to know it !

17:11.539 --> 17:13.868
Jackie Burkhart and I are in love !

17:14.574 --> 17:16.101
With disco !

17:18.011 --> 17:19.089
Wait.. what ?

17:19.646 --> 17:21.636
Yeah, and I will not stand by
and let you...

17:22.087 --> 17:26.866
...set fire to this muscial,
booty-shakinâ masterpieces !

17:33.024 --> 17:34.678
Thatâs unfortunateâ¦

17:43.679 --> 17:45.092
So you did pretty well tonight.

17:45.608 --> 17:49.371
Yup. And I learned a valuable lesson
about art versus commerce.

17:50.357 --> 17:52.343
The lesson is : Iâm rich.

17:53.808 --> 17:54.804
Good for you man.

17:55.261 --> 17:59.041
But Iâm gonna have to write you a
little ticket for disturbing the peace
and thatâs gonna cost you aboutâ¦

17:59.902 --> 18:01.055
How much you got there ?

18:02.307 --> 18:05.229
- 208 bucks.
- 208 bucks !

18:07.388 --> 18:08.219
Fine.

18:09.721 --> 18:11.028
Uhh, officer Ron ?

18:12.307 --> 18:14.389
You donât wanna buy your badge back ?

18:22.274 --> 18:24.516
Oh, uh, and your car ?

18:28.089 --> 18:30.468
Oh, this whole night has been
a nightmare.

18:30.933 --> 18:32.655
You know I thought Fez was gonna
tell me he loved me,

18:32.655 --> 18:34.714
but no, he was just trying to be
a good friend.

18:35.390 --> 18:36.604
Ugh, what a jerk.

18:38.111 --> 18:39.934
Jackie, everybody could use
another friend.

18:40.964 --> 18:42.620
Well except Randy.

18:44.829 --> 18:46.604
What are you looking at bitch ?!

18:58.870 --> 19:00.575
Avon calling !

19:04.199 --> 19:06.873
Josh ! Jeff ! Youâre back !

19:08.407 --> 19:10.591
Look Red, Josh and Jeff are back !

19:11.746 --> 19:13.278
Heyyyâ¦ men...

19:16.282 --> 19:18.721
Red, we just wanted to come by
and thank you.

19:19.471 --> 19:20.887
- Thank me ?
- Yeah.

19:21.310 --> 19:25.626
Itâs not that easy for two guys like
us to just move in to a new
neighbourhood and make friends.

19:26.186 --> 19:28.581
But you welcomed us into
your home with open arms.

19:30.782 --> 19:32.615
Wellâ¦ sureâ¦
Youâre a couple of...

19:33.080 --> 19:34.300
...decent guys.

19:35.559 --> 19:36.834
Not before he had his coffeeâ¦

19:39.126 --> 19:40.563
Like youâre a ray of sunshine !

19:41.861 --> 19:43.656
Anyway, youâve been great.

19:44.122 --> 19:46.424
The last place we lived, we had to
tell people we were brothers.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.373
Who would ever believe that the two
of us could be brothers ?!

19:52.280 --> 19:56.405
Anyway, we wanted to give you this,
you know, to say thanks.

19:57.593 --> 19:58.529
What is it ?

20:00.092 --> 20:01.139
Fruit-cake.

20:06.897 --> 20:08.552
Well, thatâs clever !

20:09.186 --> 20:11.677
Itâs a dessert and an ice-breaker !

20:12.985 --> 20:17.983
Well, what do you say we all sit down
and watch the Packers kick the crap
out of the Vikings, huh ?

20:18.751 --> 20:20.222
Well, we like the Vikingsâ¦

20:24.939 --> 20:26.312
What did you sayâ¦ ?

20:28.235 --> 20:30.501
Youâre Viking-fans ?!

20:31.782 --> 20:34.081
What the hell is wrong with you ?!

20:34.939 --> 20:36.469
Get out of my house !

20:36.750 --> 20:39.753
Red come on, itâs not our fault.
Weâre from Minnesota.

20:40.376 --> 20:41.988
We were born this way !

20:43.146 --> 20:45.926
Out ! Out ! Sicko's !

20:54.486 --> 20:55.661
Well thanks a lot Red.

20:56.379 --> 20:59.783
Now Iâll never know what rug
ties this room together.

21:18.630 --> 21:20.601
Thank you. Next please.

21:22.410 --> 21:23.818
Pokpokpok, hi guys !

21:24.774 --> 21:26.908
I love it, thatâs exactly what we need !

21:27.283 --> 21:29.190
Leather guy, youâre out,
Chicken youâre in.

21:29.428 --> 21:31.088
Halleluja !
