00:23.000 --> 00:25.491
The burglar alarm has
just been deactivated.

00:26.704 --> 00:28.365
He took my diamond bracelet!

00:28.572 --> 00:30.802
Elliot's office was
robbed by a dead man.

00:30.875 --> 00:31.864
Or a very able student.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.479
You've been reading
too many gossip columns.

00:35.546 --> 00:37.571
For your information,
there was no robbery.

00:37.681 --> 00:38.579
Now get in.

00:38.649 --> 00:40.116
Give us a head start,
then follow.

00:41.352 --> 00:42.717
Kisses don't lie.

00:44.455 --> 00:47.891
Uh, they're real.
Borrowed, but real.

00:51.529 --> 00:52.689
Stop!

01:05.476 --> 01:08.036
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:08.145 --> 01:10.306
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:10.414 --> 01:12.814
who does not exist.

01:18.656 --> 01:20.681
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:20.758 --> 01:23.488
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:23.561 --> 01:25.324
the helpless, the powerless,

01:25.396 --> 01:28.763
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

04:21.204 --> 04:23.036
You've been awfully
quiet tonight.

04:23.107 --> 04:24.574
What's the matter,
you homesick?

04:24.642 --> 04:28.601
No. However, it will be nice
to see April and Devon again.

04:28.679 --> 04:30.112
You're homesick.

04:52.603 --> 04:55.333
Hey, you!
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

04:58.075 --> 04:59.542
KITT, what was that?

04:59.610 --> 05:01.202
A pistol shot, Michael.

05:01.312 --> 05:02.210
Where?

05:02.279 --> 05:03.473
Just up the street.

05:03.580 --> 05:05.047
Surely you're
not thinking of...

05:05.115 --> 05:06.207
Apparently you are.

05:15.526 --> 05:17.118
Did you see a guy
run by here?

05:17.194 --> 05:18.752
He went in the alley.
Need some help?

05:18.829 --> 05:20.126
I could use
some light.

05:27.538 --> 05:29.768
KITT, can you pick him up
on your scanner?

05:29.840 --> 05:31.171
How extraordinary.

05:31.241 --> 05:32.765
I had him on my scanner,
Michael.

05:32.843 --> 05:34.708
He simply vanished.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.336
Who said that?

05:51.829 --> 05:52.853
Hi, Devon.

05:52.930 --> 05:54.955
Ah, Michael,
welcome back.

05:55.265 --> 05:57.961
"Welcome back"?
"Welcome back"?

05:58.035 --> 06:01.801
I mean, I didn't expect a brass band
or a red carpet or anything like that,

06:01.872 --> 06:05.171
but I wouldn't have minded a nice
little ceremony, you know. Just family.

06:05.275 --> 06:07.573
You, me, April,
nice quiet dinner,

06:07.644 --> 06:10.340
bottle of champagne,
domestic would've been fine.

06:10.647 --> 06:12.114
You were only away a week.

06:13.951 --> 06:15.179
How was your vacation?

06:15.252 --> 06:16.378
My vacation?

06:16.453 --> 06:18.387
Now, wait a minute.
Let's define terms here.

06:18.455 --> 06:20.582
That was strictly business,
remember?

06:20.657 --> 06:22.090
Now comes
the vacation.

06:22.159 --> 06:23.558
Oh, no, I'm afraid not,
Michael.

06:23.627 --> 06:25.652
Not just yet, at least.

06:27.598 --> 06:29.327
I should've known.

06:33.070 --> 06:34.094
What's up?

06:34.171 --> 06:36.105
Something
rather intriguing.

06:36.173 --> 06:39.370
It seems the newspapers
received anonymous tips

06:39.443 --> 06:42.139
regarding a number
of elaborate robberies

06:42.246 --> 06:45.704
which apparently have not
been reported to the police.

06:46.316 --> 06:48.284
All right,
sounds very intriguing.

06:48.385 --> 06:49.682
What's that got
to do with us?

06:49.753 --> 06:50.947
There.

06:52.423 --> 06:54.721
"Your generosity
is appreciated. "

06:54.792 --> 06:58.284
The robberies were committed by a
cat burglar with a very definite M.O.

06:58.362 --> 07:00.023
which included
leaving a card like that

07:00.097 --> 07:01.724
behind on the scene
each time.

07:01.799 --> 07:03.733
Devon, how'd you get this?

07:03.801 --> 07:06.361
By going to the theatre
one night, many years ago,

07:06.470 --> 07:08.131
and then going out
to supper afterwards

07:08.172 --> 07:09.639
while my apartment
was being robbed

07:09.706 --> 07:12.470
by a cat burglar.
He left that card behind.

07:12.543 --> 07:15.671
I've kept it all these years
as a sort of memento.

07:15.779 --> 07:17.246
I wonder
if it's the same guy.

07:17.314 --> 07:18.281
I beg your pardon?

07:18.382 --> 07:20.350
Devon, I almost hit
a guy last night

07:20.451 --> 07:22.214
who was dressed
like a cat burglar.

07:22.286 --> 07:24.311
And then he disappeared
right in front of my eyes,

07:24.388 --> 07:25.855
like Houdini.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.413
This guy ever
been identified?

07:27.491 --> 07:28.924
Never positively, no.

07:28.992 --> 07:30.254
But it was widely believed

07:30.327 --> 07:32.352
that it was a man
named Raymond Fallan,

07:32.429 --> 07:34.363
a very clever
and daring chap.

07:34.431 --> 07:36.296
Nothing against him
was ever proved.

07:36.366 --> 07:39.358
And now he reappears
after all these years, huh?

07:39.436 --> 07:41.631
Well, that's
what's intriguing, Michael.

07:41.705 --> 07:44.902
You see, the newspaper reports
that Raymond Fallan

07:45.342 --> 07:46.741
died a month ago.

08:19.543 --> 08:21.443
Let's see
what you've got.

08:33.056 --> 08:34.489
Nice.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.960
Very nice. For this,
an extra $100,000.

08:41.030 --> 08:43.124
It's worth
twice that.

08:44.635 --> 08:45.863
Let me think about it.

08:45.936 --> 08:47.403
Don't take too long.

08:59.716 --> 09:02.082
The current market value
of the Sangre de Coeur

09:02.152 --> 09:04.086
is $350,000, Michael.

09:04.688 --> 09:07.020
Devon's cat burglar
has exquisite taste.

09:07.124 --> 09:09.092
Or incredible luck.

09:09.126 --> 09:12.152
KITT, it's the only item
mentioned in the newspaper.

09:12.229 --> 09:14.322
Of course,
I find it hard to understand

09:14.398 --> 09:17.162
why anyone would value
a mere bauble so highly.

09:17.234 --> 09:21.170
According to my data, a ruby
is just a form of carbon.

09:21.238 --> 09:24.105
Maybe. But that bauble,
as you call it

09:24.174 --> 09:27.268
is very valuable
because it's very, very rare.

09:27.377 --> 09:28.867
The law of supply and demand?

09:28.979 --> 09:30.344
Exactly.

09:30.547 --> 09:32.481
All right, KITT,
let's see what you got

09:32.549 --> 09:34.517
on one particular
Raymond Fallan.

09:35.052 --> 09:37.145
There's your cat burglar,
Michael.

09:37.220 --> 09:38.619
I'm afraid
it's not very recent,

09:38.689 --> 09:40.179
but that's because
he's deceased.

09:40.257 --> 09:42.282
I do have his
last known address.

09:42.359 --> 09:44.725
Oh, and one more thing.
A daughter.

09:44.795 --> 09:46.092
Oh, really?

09:46.930 --> 09:49.296
Not bad. Not bad at all.

09:49.967 --> 09:52.936
I'd say thank you, Michael,
but I have the feeling

09:53.003 --> 09:55.437
you're not referring
to my technical proficiency.

10:52.863 --> 10:54.023
How're you doing?

10:57.934 --> 11:01.062
Would you mind raining
on someone else's parade?

11:02.506 --> 11:03.871
Thank you.

11:06.476 --> 11:08.307
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't hear the bell.

11:08.412 --> 11:10.073
I almost stabbed you
with these things.

11:10.180 --> 11:12.307
Yeah, I'm glad
you spared me.

11:13.283 --> 11:15.274
You're Grace Fallan,
right?

11:16.386 --> 11:17.478
Yes.

11:17.854 --> 11:18.980
What do you want?

11:19.056 --> 11:20.148
My name's
Michael Knight.

11:20.223 --> 11:22.453
I'm with The Foundation
for Law and Government.

11:22.526 --> 11:24.960
I'd like to talk to you
about your dad.

11:25.028 --> 11:27.121
Oh, in that case there's
nothing to talk about.

11:27.197 --> 11:28.289
My father died
a month ago.

11:28.365 --> 11:30.731
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

11:41.411 --> 11:42.878
Two questions.

11:43.814 --> 11:44.974
Please?

11:46.883 --> 11:49.283
You said you're with
some kind of agency.

11:49.753 --> 11:51.482
This must be the beginning.

11:51.555 --> 11:53.113
Beginning of what?

11:53.256 --> 11:54.951
I've spent
my whole life terrified

11:55.025 --> 11:57.357
to see articles in the paper
about cat burglars,

11:57.427 --> 12:00.555
knowing people would
start asking me questions.

12:00.630 --> 12:03.827
I thought that now my
father's dead, it would end.

12:04.034 --> 12:07.595
Here you are, with a thousand
questions on your face.

12:07.871 --> 12:10.897
A very famous necklace
was stolen last night.

12:11.975 --> 12:15.376
The burglar left a calling
card just like this one.

12:16.046 --> 12:19.015
There's something you should
understand about me and my father.

12:19.116 --> 12:21.311
I didn't know him
as a notorious cat burglar.

12:21.384 --> 12:24.444
To me, he was a wonderful man
who did magic tricks,

12:24.788 --> 12:26.415
told stories,
he even came down

12:26.490 --> 12:28.788
the chimney at Christmas,
like Santa.

12:28.859 --> 12:30.918
Well, someone's using
your father's M.O.

12:30.994 --> 12:33.326
to pull off some highly
professional burglaries.

12:33.396 --> 12:35.591
And someone's feeding
the press information

12:35.665 --> 12:36.962
about those burglaries.

12:37.033 --> 12:39.831
Grace, you said so yourself,
this could just be the beginning.

12:39.903 --> 12:40.870
Look,

12:41.471 --> 12:43.564
I lead a nice
quiet life now, okay?

12:43.640 --> 12:45.437
I work with children.

12:45.575 --> 12:47.372
I don't want to be notorious.

12:47.477 --> 12:49.911
I don't want my name opened up
for public consumption.

12:49.980 --> 12:51.572
Maybe I can help.

12:52.082 --> 12:54.448
Did anyone else know
your father's techniques?

12:54.518 --> 12:55.712
Only one person.

12:55.786 --> 12:56.946
Who?

12:57.921 --> 12:58.979
Me.

13:00.824 --> 13:03.315
Thanks for offering to help,

13:04.027 --> 13:06.655
but I prefer to think
it will just go away.

13:08.765 --> 13:10.528
I hope you're right.

13:20.811 --> 13:22.073
Need some help?

13:22.245 --> 13:23.507
Oh, no,
thank you, sir.

13:23.613 --> 13:25.604
That is very kind
of you.

13:25.715 --> 13:28.684
I'm, uh, Miss Grace's butler, Griffin.

13:28.785 --> 13:29.945
Sure I can't give you
a hand?

13:30.020 --> 13:32.215
No, thank you. I'm quite
used to it, actually.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.416
Besides,
the exercise does me good.

13:34.491 --> 13:35.617
Okay.

14:05.455 --> 14:07.514
I'm not sure
I understand, Michael.

14:07.591 --> 14:09.081
You think
there's a possibility

14:09.159 --> 14:11.218
Raymond Fallan's daughter
is the cat burglar?

14:11.294 --> 14:12.989
Yeah, it's a possibility.

14:13.063 --> 14:14.724
Right now that's all it is.

14:14.798 --> 14:16.766
Not a penny over $400.

14:17.901 --> 14:19.163
What?

14:19.236 --> 14:21.261
Grace Fallan's diamond ring.

14:21.338 --> 14:22.737
The stones were tiny,
Michael.

14:22.806 --> 14:24.865
Not at all what a prosperous
cat burglar would wear.

14:26.009 --> 14:27.670
Yeah, well,
I'll keep that in mind.

14:27.777 --> 14:29.404
Devon's calling.

14:29.512 --> 14:31.480
Hello, Devon, what's up?

14:32.449 --> 14:33.973
It took a lot of persuasion,

14:34.084 --> 14:35.551
but my sources
at the newspaper

14:35.619 --> 14:38.452
finally confided the names
of the three burglary victims:

14:38.521 --> 14:40.284
Thomas Delbert,
Delbert.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.825
Claude Anderson
and Maxwell Elliot.

14:42.893 --> 14:45.487
And although it is
not common knowledge,

14:45.562 --> 14:47.655
Elliot is the owner
of the Sangre de Coeur.

14:47.731 --> 14:50.666
Maybe he can shed some light
on the subject.

14:50.967 --> 14:52.093
Goodbye, Devon.

14:52.168 --> 14:53.430
Bye, Michael.

15:22.933 --> 15:24.958
Yes, well,
you tell them for me

15:25.035 --> 15:26.969
that I want it done my way.

15:28.171 --> 15:29.798
Do that for me.

15:32.475 --> 15:33.737
Good.

15:34.344 --> 15:38.212
All right, since you managed to
talk your way past my secretary,

15:38.281 --> 15:40.772
you must have something
compelling to say.

15:40.884 --> 15:43.352
You have three minutes
in which to say it.

15:43.453 --> 15:45.683
Hmm. In that case
I'll get right to the point.

15:45.755 --> 15:48.315
You were robbed last night.
Someone cleaned out your safe

15:48.391 --> 15:50.757
and got away with
the Sangre de Coeur necklace.

15:50.827 --> 15:52.624
Uh, you've been misinformed.

15:52.696 --> 15:55.096
For your information,
there was no robbery.

15:55.165 --> 15:57.463
You've been reading
too many gossip columns.

15:57.534 --> 15:59.764
Do you know Claude Anderson
and Thomas Delbert?

15:59.836 --> 16:02.999
No, I don't.
You have 2 minutes left.

16:03.073 --> 16:05.803
Oh, in that case, I'd better
learn how to talk faster, huh?

16:05.909 --> 16:08.139
How many people knew
where you kept the necklace?

16:08.211 --> 16:09.940
Where I keep the necklace

16:10.046 --> 16:12.037
is no one's business
but my own.

16:12.148 --> 16:13.615
May I see it?

16:14.084 --> 16:15.881
Don't press your luck.

16:15.952 --> 16:17.613
Got a minute left.

16:32.702 --> 16:34.101
Time's up.

16:44.848 --> 16:47.612
My sensors indicate you're
somewhat disturbed, Michael.

16:47.684 --> 16:50.414
Yeah, you could say that. Look,
I want you to scan the building.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.785
I wanna find out if Elliot
was robbed last night or not.

16:55.558 --> 16:57.992
Threadlike abrasions
indicate the play of cable

16:58.061 --> 16:59.824
against the edge
of the office window.

16:59.896 --> 17:02.797
I also detect the residue
of a foreign substance

17:02.866 --> 17:05.060
with considerable
abrasive properties.

17:05.135 --> 17:06.432
As in cutting?

17:06.502 --> 17:07.834
That's correct, Michael.

17:07.904 --> 17:09.394
What did you get
on the jewelry?

17:09.472 --> 17:11.440
His two-karat diamond ring

17:11.508 --> 17:14.965
is actually a cubic zirconia
in disguise.

17:15.078 --> 17:17.944
No, I mean the Sangre de Coeur
he showed me.

17:18.013 --> 17:18.981
Is that real?

17:19.348 --> 17:22.318
Paste?
Are you absolutely sure?

17:22.719 --> 17:24.050
KITT is.

17:24.686 --> 17:27.917
But why? It's one thing
not to report a burglary,

17:27.991 --> 17:30.084
but to go so far as to provide
a phony necklace,

17:30.160 --> 17:31.593
that's quite another.

17:31.661 --> 17:33.595
It defies credibility.

17:33.663 --> 17:35.153
To us,

17:35.231 --> 17:37.392
but maybe not
to a criminal mind.

17:37.467 --> 17:40.368
The men who've been robbed,
Delbert, Anderson, and Elliot,

17:40.437 --> 17:42.462
all have something
in common.

17:42.539 --> 17:45.997
They've all made a great deal
of their money illegally.

17:46.076 --> 17:49.341
Sounds like a real good reason
not to go to the police.

17:49.446 --> 17:51.437
Are you suggesting that

17:51.548 --> 17:53.277
whatever was
in their safes

17:53.383 --> 17:54.941
might incriminate them?

17:55.051 --> 17:56.177
I am.

17:56.486 --> 17:59.387
I'll bet that's why Elliot
had the fake Sangre de Coeur.

17:59.456 --> 18:01.321
To prove
he hadn't been robbed.

18:01.391 --> 18:04.053
What about KITT's data
on the burglary?

18:04.461 --> 18:07.294
It's Fallan's M.O.
in every detail.

18:07.764 --> 18:10.562
So Elliot's office
was robbed by a dead man.

18:10.633 --> 18:12.533
Or a very able student.

18:33.556 --> 18:35.023
Hi, Grace!

18:48.705 --> 18:49.899
Hello.

18:49.973 --> 18:51.600
How did you find me?

18:51.674 --> 18:53.801
Through brilliant deduction.

18:53.877 --> 18:54.935
Griffin told me.

18:56.479 --> 18:59.642
I'd like to think this was
a strictly social visit,

18:59.749 --> 19:02.775
but you've got the look of
somebody with more questions.

19:02.886 --> 19:04.581
Just a few.

19:05.688 --> 19:07.656
Any of these names
sound familiar:

19:07.724 --> 19:11.251
Thomas Delbert, Claude
Anderson or Maxwell Elliot?

19:12.128 --> 19:14.323
George Friedrich.
Harold Salen.

19:14.397 --> 19:16.422
After Dad died,
I was going through his things

19:16.499 --> 19:17.830
and I found
a list of names.

19:17.901 --> 19:19.892
Those three you mentioned
and the two I added.

19:19.969 --> 19:22.665
Yeah, well, Delbert,
Anderson, and Elliot

19:22.739 --> 19:24.468
were burglarized recently.

19:26.843 --> 19:29.710
Wait a minute.
Are you suspicious of me?

19:31.080 --> 19:33.048
If I were trying
to hide something from you,

19:33.149 --> 19:35.777
why would I tell you
any names at all?

19:38.788 --> 19:42.349
No, Elizabeth. Keep the ball
in front of you on the serve.

19:43.459 --> 19:46.758
See? Like this.
Right up in front.

19:48.398 --> 19:50.025
Yeah, KITT, what is it?

19:50.099 --> 19:51.896
Michael, the man
at the picnic table

19:51.968 --> 19:53.492
is heavily armed.

20:01.377 --> 20:02.867
Excuse me.

20:04.113 --> 20:06.547
I'd like to talk to you
for a minute.

20:09.219 --> 20:12.620
KITT, I need some help, buddy.
Cut him off.

20:35.878 --> 20:37.345
Well, now,

20:37.580 --> 20:41.311
since you're so interested,
the name's Barth.

20:42.118 --> 20:45.110
Police Lt. George Barth.

20:45.521 --> 20:47.648
And you're just about
a gnat's hair away

20:47.724 --> 20:49.954
from getting busted
for obstruction of justice.

20:50.026 --> 20:52.290
Lt. Barth.
I should have known.

20:54.264 --> 20:56.459
You hounded my father
for 20 years.

20:56.532 --> 20:58.159
He's dead and buried.

20:58.234 --> 21:00.759
Why can't you just
leave it at that?

21:00.903 --> 21:03.701
You can hide behind
your manicured bushes

21:03.773 --> 21:05.331
and your fancy house,

21:05.975 --> 21:09.467
but I know who you are,
and I know what you do.

21:10.446 --> 21:13.745
And the only difference
between you and your father

21:13.850 --> 21:15.909
is I'm gonna catch you.

21:16.686 --> 21:18.313
And that's a promise.

21:43.212 --> 21:44.110
Hi.

21:44.180 --> 21:45.147
Ah, Miss Grace.

21:45.214 --> 21:46.681
Be careful up there.

21:59.562 --> 22:01.860
Did Lt. Barth
ever arrest your father?

22:01.931 --> 22:04.957
Twice. Dad was always out
on bail in time for breakfast.

22:05.034 --> 22:06.626
Who bailed him out?
Griffin.

22:06.703 --> 22:08.637
He's always
taken care of everything.

22:08.705 --> 22:11.071
Dad hired him
before I was born.

22:11.474 --> 22:13.738
While my father was out
borrowing the crown jewels,

22:13.810 --> 22:15.573
Griffin was changing
my diaper.

22:15.678 --> 22:17.646
What's the story
with this Barth guy, anyway?

22:17.747 --> 22:19.339
Why is he so obsessed
with your father?

22:19.449 --> 22:21.007
Who knows
why people become obsessed?

22:21.117 --> 22:22.846
George Barth is.

22:22.919 --> 22:24.443
All I know is
with a man like that,

22:24.554 --> 22:26.351
I'm guilty
until proven innocent.

22:26.422 --> 22:27.582
To a man like that,

22:27.657 --> 22:29.716
it might not make
much difference.

22:30.126 --> 22:32.253
Grace, I still
want to help.

22:32.328 --> 22:34.159
I think Barth figures
you've taken up

22:34.230 --> 22:35.891
where your dad left off.

22:36.666 --> 22:38.896
The man is after you.

22:39.802 --> 22:42.032
Now it's not
gonna go away.

22:55.051 --> 22:57.042
The list
I told you about.

22:58.755 --> 23:02.191
Well, if the cat's following
this, George Friedrich's next.

23:02.258 --> 23:05.022
Molly Friedrich's just invited
me to a society fund raiser

23:05.094 --> 23:07.324
at her restaurant,
Chez Voltaire.

23:07.430 --> 23:10.092
It's exactly the kind of
affair my father loved to hit.

23:10.133 --> 23:13.261
No kidding. Uh, how many
is the invitation for?

23:13.870 --> 23:15.929
Two. Interested?

23:16.572 --> 23:18.199
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

23:19.776 --> 23:20.800
Good.

23:20.877 --> 23:24.005
I've always had a weakness
for men in three-piece suits.

23:30.453 --> 23:32.387
Nice. Very nice.

23:32.455 --> 23:35.288
Oh, Grace,
how delightful to see you.

23:35.358 --> 23:38.088
You're looking
absolutely wonderful.

23:38.161 --> 23:39.753
Thanks, Molly.

23:39.829 --> 23:42.127
And what a pleasant surprise
this is.

23:42.198 --> 23:44.098
You must be...
Michael Knight.

23:44.167 --> 23:45.361
Michael.

23:46.135 --> 23:48.262
So happy you could join us.

23:49.539 --> 23:52.269
Come in. Come in.
Have a drink.

23:53.976 --> 23:55.637
Better count
your fingers.

23:55.745 --> 23:58.805
She'd take any piece of
you that wasn't attached.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.940
Hey, uh,
do you validate?

24:03.853 --> 24:04.785
Here you go.

24:04.854 --> 24:06.048
Thanks.

24:07.824 --> 24:10.622
Say, if the cat burglar
was gonna come in,

24:10.960 --> 24:13.019
where do you think
he'd make his entrance?

24:13.095 --> 24:15.723
The offices back there
next to the kitchen.

24:15.898 --> 24:18.230
Oh, here comes Molly
again.

24:18.367 --> 24:20.426
I have a sudden urge
to powder my nose.

24:20.503 --> 24:22.334
Uh-uh,
oh, great, thanks a lot.

24:22.405 --> 24:23.497
Michael,

24:23.973 --> 24:26.464
this is criminal.

24:26.542 --> 24:27.531
What is?

24:27.643 --> 24:29.736
A gorgeous man
like you, alone.

24:30.947 --> 24:33.711
Oh, but you're worth
breaking the law for.

24:33.783 --> 24:35.045
Thank you.

24:35.117 --> 24:37.483
Oh, and now,
tell me, Michael Knight,

24:37.553 --> 24:41.353
where did Grace find you?
She never even mentioned you,

24:41.424 --> 24:43.187
not that I blame her.

24:44.193 --> 24:46.286
Oh, Grace is such
a dear, sweet child,

24:46.362 --> 24:47.989
but is slightly bit, uh,

24:48.097 --> 24:50.930
unconventional,
if you know what I mean.

24:51.100 --> 24:54.297
Of course, with a father
like, uh, Raymond Fallan,

24:54.370 --> 24:56.201
what can you expect?

25:00.076 --> 25:03.204
How darling.
A wrist alarm.

25:03.312 --> 25:04.779
No, actually it's a beeper.

25:04.881 --> 25:05.779
A beeper?

25:05.882 --> 25:07.850
Yeah, it's a beeper.
I gotta go.

25:07.950 --> 25:09.008
Oh.

25:12.455 --> 25:13.547
Yeah, KITT, what's up?

25:13.623 --> 25:15.614
The burglar alarm has
just been deactivated.

25:15.691 --> 25:16.589
Where?

25:16.659 --> 25:18.354
Somewhere inside the building,
Michael.

25:18.427 --> 25:20.952
I'm detecting some
electrical interference.

25:27.336 --> 25:28.496
My bracelet!

25:28.571 --> 25:30.698
He took
my diamond bracelet!

25:30.973 --> 25:33.066
My-my diamond bracelet,
he took it!

25:33.142 --> 25:36.373
KITT, meet me at the west side
of the building right away.

25:52.929 --> 25:54.089
Stop!

25:58.901 --> 26:01.369
KITT, he'll be killed!
Run some cover for him.

26:17.553 --> 26:18.986
You let her get away.

26:19.055 --> 26:21.489
I had her right in my hand
and you let her get-

26:21.557 --> 26:23.252
What are you doing,
shooting to kill?

26:23.326 --> 26:25.419
What I do is none
of your business, Knight.

26:26.629 --> 26:28.927
And whether you like it or
not, I'm a cop and you're not.

26:28.998 --> 26:31.899
Let me tell you something. You
operate under the same laws I do

26:31.968 --> 26:34.095
whether you like it or not.

26:34.503 --> 26:37.336
Why do you insist
on defending her?

26:37.406 --> 26:39.636
Why do you insist
on persecuting her?

26:39.709 --> 26:41.643
Because she's guilty.

26:42.011 --> 26:44.138
Now she was up there tonight,
right?

26:44.647 --> 26:46.979
With you, right?

26:47.049 --> 26:49.950
Was she with you
when the lights went out?

26:52.021 --> 26:54.251
I know the answer
to that one.

26:58.194 --> 27:01.186
Dear, I'm sorry,
I'm so terribly sorry.

27:01.263 --> 27:02.855
Please, I'm so-
Where's Grace?

27:02.932 --> 27:04.559
If I knew,
I'd have her arrested.

27:04.634 --> 27:06.659
She took my diamond bracelet
right off my wrist.

27:06.769 --> 27:08.202
Now, wait a minute.

27:08.304 --> 27:09.737
Are you sure it was Grace?

27:09.805 --> 27:11.295
It was the cat burglar.

27:11.374 --> 27:13.308
Who else could it be
but Grace?

27:20.883 --> 27:23.249
All right, keep your scanners
peeled for anything unusual.

27:23.319 --> 27:25.116
Would you care to be
more specific?

27:25.187 --> 27:26.916
I would if I could.

27:35.297 --> 27:36.559
Did you catch him?

27:36.632 --> 27:38.099
No, he got away.

27:38.401 --> 27:40.266
He or she.

27:42.872 --> 27:45.204
So that's it.
Now you suspect me again.

27:45.274 --> 27:47.868
Look, I don't want to, but
you don't leave me much choice.

27:47.943 --> 27:50.104
One minute you're there,
the next minute you leave.

27:50.212 --> 27:53.147
As soon as you're gone, the lights
go out and the cat burglar appears.

27:53.215 --> 27:55.683
For your information,
I was in the powder room.

27:55.818 --> 27:58.412
And no, I can't prove it. I-
I- I didn't bring a witness along.

27:58.487 --> 28:00.512
Why did you leave?
Why didn't you wait for me?

28:00.589 --> 28:02.022
Because...

28:02.158 --> 28:04.251
I knew people would
start looking at me.

28:04.326 --> 28:06.954
"She's the cat's daughter. "
"I'll bet she's involved. "

28:07.063 --> 28:08.928
So I took a cab home.

28:09.598 --> 28:11.759
Do you believe me?
I want to.

28:11.834 --> 28:14.302
Grace, Barth was there
tonight.

28:14.370 --> 28:16.804
He almost killed
the cat burglar.

28:17.139 --> 28:18.970
Now he's convinced
it's you.

28:19.041 --> 28:20.303
If it is,

28:20.376 --> 28:22.674
you better give it up
while you're still ahead.

28:22.778 --> 28:24.746
While you're still alive.

28:25.314 --> 28:27.782
You're really concerned,
aren't you?

28:28.851 --> 28:30.478
You really care.

28:31.687 --> 28:32.949
Michael,

28:33.422 --> 28:35.151
I'm not the cat.

28:41.230 --> 28:42.993
Kisses don't lie.

28:49.338 --> 28:51.135
Well, I beg your pardon,
Miss Grace,

28:51.207 --> 28:54.506
but I heard you and wondered if
you might be needing anything.

28:54.577 --> 28:56.272
No thanks, Griffin.

28:56.378 --> 28:58.812
Mr. Knight
was just leaving.

29:02.118 --> 29:04.382
In case
you hadn't noticed.

29:23.572 --> 29:24.766
Well, well, Michael.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.206
Carnauba wax
and glycerol on your collar.

29:27.276 --> 29:29.608
Is that any way
to catch a cat?

29:29.712 --> 29:31.680
We'll see, KITT.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.943
How about you,
what'd you come up with?

29:34.049 --> 29:37.075
I did notice something rather
peculiar while you were in the house.

29:37.186 --> 29:38.346
What?

29:38.888 --> 29:41.379
The vehicle in the garage
exhibits heat stress.

29:41.457 --> 29:43.448
Exhaust, radiator,
and tire temperatures

29:43.526 --> 29:45.187
indicate it's been
recently driven

29:45.261 --> 29:46.853
at a high rate of speed.

29:46.929 --> 29:49.557
And nobody's been home
to drive it

29:50.065 --> 29:52.056
but the butler.

29:55.938 --> 29:57.303
Thanks, pal.

29:57.473 --> 29:58.906
Don't mention it.

30:21.630 --> 30:23.257
Why, Mr. Knight.

30:25.267 --> 30:27.394
Can I see you a minute,
Mr. Griffin?

30:27.536 --> 30:29.868
Of course, sir.
Please, come in.

30:32.007 --> 30:33.338
Griffin,

30:33.409 --> 30:34.603
did you go out tonight?

30:34.710 --> 30:36.200
Oh, no, sir.

30:36.312 --> 30:38.212
I'm afraid
the old war wound's

30:38.280 --> 30:39.975
been acting up again
lately, sir.

30:41.383 --> 30:42.850
In that case
you might like to know

30:42.952 --> 30:45.978
that somebody's been
driving your car tonight.

30:46.222 --> 30:47.621
Oh, dear.

30:49.158 --> 30:51.092
Please don't tell
Miss Grace, sir.

30:51.994 --> 30:53.256
You see,

30:53.796 --> 30:57.823
I'm afraid
I'm a midnight nipper, sir.

30:58.601 --> 31:00.501
Although I have
a history of liver ailments

31:00.569 --> 31:02.264
which precludes
my drinking.

31:03.639 --> 31:07.075
Well, Miss Grace would be
most displeased with me, sir.

31:07.343 --> 31:10.437
So I drove quite fast
in order to beat her home.

31:11.080 --> 31:12.775
You didn't happen to be
in the vicinity

31:12.882 --> 31:15.476
of the Chez Voltaire
restaurant tonight, did you?

31:15.584 --> 31:18.451
Oh, no, sir.
I prefer health foods.

31:21.957 --> 31:24.084
He was born
in Lancashire, England,

31:24.159 --> 31:25.854
third generation butler.

31:25.928 --> 31:28.624
He's been with the Fallans
since 1950.

31:28.697 --> 31:31.791
Shot in the leg in World
War ll, won a Purple Heart.

31:31.867 --> 31:34.097
You did say he had
a pronounced limp, didn't you?

31:34.169 --> 31:35.136
Yeah.

31:35.204 --> 31:37.195
Obviously
his war injury.

31:37.373 --> 31:39.273
Michael, are you sure

31:39.341 --> 31:41.969
your interest in Grace Fallan
hasn't clouded your judgment?

31:43.178 --> 31:46.773
I don't know. I don't know
what to think anymore.

31:48.717 --> 31:51.049
Well, you think
it was Grace, don't you?

31:51.253 --> 31:54.086
Look at the facts.
She's physically capable,

31:54.156 --> 31:55.453
she was
at the restaurant,

31:55.524 --> 31:57.219
she can't verify
her whereabouts.

31:57.293 --> 31:58.487
What about
Raymond Fallan?

31:58.560 --> 31:59.584
What about him?

31:59.662 --> 32:01.289
He was presumed dead
in a plane crash,

32:01.363 --> 32:02.489
his body was never found.

32:02.564 --> 32:04.498
Maybe he's not dead
after all.

32:04.566 --> 32:06.727
All right, it's a long shot.
But it's possible.

32:06.802 --> 32:09.327
It's also possible
that Griffin's not nearly

32:09.405 --> 32:11.430
as disabled as everybody
thinks he is.

32:16.845 --> 32:17.812
You must admit

32:17.913 --> 32:19.904
that's an awfully
pronounced limp, Michael.

32:20.015 --> 32:21.744
Whose side are you on, anyway?

32:21.817 --> 32:23.375
The side of logic.

32:24.219 --> 32:25.948
If logic could
explain everything, KITT,

32:26.021 --> 32:27.989
people wouldn't pay
thousands of dollars

32:28.057 --> 32:29.922
for stones
that are worth pennies.

32:29.992 --> 32:32.222
Which reminds me, Michael,
how much did you pay

32:32.294 --> 32:34.262
for those cuff links
you wore last night?

32:34.330 --> 32:36.594
They were a gift. Why?

32:36.699 --> 32:38.792
They were gold-filled.
Far be it from me

32:38.867 --> 32:40.960
to speculate
on their value, but-

32:41.036 --> 32:42.003
Then don't.

32:42.071 --> 32:44.869
Very well.
Not over $3 wholesale.

32:53.315 --> 32:55.340
KITT, wait a minute.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.112
Run a medical scan
on Griffin

32:57.186 --> 32:59.484
and see if you can
find the old war injury.

33:01.623 --> 33:02.783
I do detect
an early trauma

33:02.858 --> 33:04.655
to Mr. Griffin's
left upper femur.

33:04.727 --> 33:07.491
Well, in that case,
it seems kind of strange

33:07.596 --> 33:10.326
that he limps on his
right leg, don't you think?

33:20.809 --> 33:23.073
So much for
old war wounds, huh?

33:23.178 --> 33:24.611
To quote the cliche,

33:24.680 --> 33:26.614
it appears as if
"the butler did it. "

33:26.682 --> 33:28.274
Looks like we're gonna
have to share

33:28.384 --> 33:30.181
a few unpleasant thoughts
with Grace.

33:30.252 --> 33:31.344
Get me Devon.

33:32.521 --> 33:34.614
Michael, I was just about
to contact you.

33:34.690 --> 33:36.487
Any luck with Griffin?

33:36.558 --> 33:39.118
More than I'd hoped for.
What's up?

33:39.194 --> 33:42.027
Well, April's come up with
something very interesting.

33:42.097 --> 33:44.258
The last name on the list,
Harold Salen,

33:44.333 --> 33:46.961
was arrested on a parole
violation last night.

33:47.036 --> 33:48.230
Oh, yeah? Where?

33:48.303 --> 33:50.567
In Mexico City.
It could take days

33:50.639 --> 33:52.834
before it becomes
public knowledge.

33:52.908 --> 33:55.604
Could it be we're thinking
along the same lines?

33:55.711 --> 33:56.769
Could be.

33:56.879 --> 33:58.642
In that case,
would you share the benefit

33:58.747 --> 34:01.238
of your brilliance with me?
I'm quite lost.

34:01.350 --> 34:03.181
Elementary, my dear Devon.

34:03.252 --> 34:05.152
With Salen out of the picture
temporarily,

34:05.254 --> 34:08.246
no one will think twice
if he throws a party.

34:08.489 --> 34:10.719
Polish up your diamonds,
April.

34:10.893 --> 34:12.382
You're invited.

34:12.460 --> 34:13.985
I'll be there.

34:18.534 --> 34:20.592
You're telling me
that a man I've known

34:20.668 --> 34:22.398
all my life
is the cat burglar,

34:22.471 --> 34:24.803
dragging my life and my
father's name through the mud?

34:24.873 --> 34:25.862
I don't believe you.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.272
I know how hard
this is for you,

34:27.342 --> 34:28.775
but I'm telling you
it's the truth.

34:28.877 --> 34:30.844
His limp is a fake.
I saw it!

34:30.946 --> 34:32.174
All right, maybe it is,

34:32.281 --> 34:34.078
but that still doesn't prove
he's the cat.

34:34.149 --> 34:35.980
I've also run a check
on his bank account.

34:36.051 --> 34:40.147
In the last month, he's deposited
and withdrawn over $500,000.

34:44.860 --> 34:47.726
Grace, I know how much
Griffin means to you.

34:47.795 --> 34:49.058
And believe it or not,

34:49.130 --> 34:50.723
I hope you're right
about him.

34:50.799 --> 34:52.357
There's one way to find out.

34:52.434 --> 34:54.333
Harold Salen's
throwing a party tonight.

34:54.402 --> 34:56.132
I managed to get
myself invited.

34:56.205 --> 34:57.433
You come with me.

34:57.506 --> 35:00.805
If the cat burglar's
true to form, he'll be there.

35:01.310 --> 35:03.676
What if he is,
and it's not Griffin?

35:03.779 --> 35:07.237
Then I'll admit I'm wrong
and apologize to both of you.

35:07.850 --> 35:09.909
But I think
he'll be there.

35:10.319 --> 35:12.082
Unless you warn him.

35:28.036 --> 35:30.869
Michael, there's a car
approaching at high speed.

35:30.939 --> 35:32.065
Thanks, KITT.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.102
Get in.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.248
Oh, am I under arrest?

35:40.349 --> 35:42.078
What's the charge?

35:42.718 --> 35:44.481
No charge.

35:44.820 --> 35:46.754
Just a little
private conversation.

35:48.056 --> 35:49.489
Now, get in.

35:52.327 --> 35:54.227
KITT, give us a head start,
then follow.

36:21.323 --> 36:24.087
I don't like you.
You're in my way.

36:24.726 --> 36:26.660
Well, if that's why
you brought me out here,

36:26.728 --> 36:27.956
I could've saved you the trip.

36:28.030 --> 36:29.759
I figured that one out
already.

36:29.831 --> 36:31.458
No, there's more to it.

36:31.633 --> 36:33.931
A lot more. Out.

36:39.975 --> 36:42.466
I did some
checking on you, Knight.

36:43.011 --> 36:45.002
You're a real
mystery man.

36:45.681 --> 36:49.048
Seems that you didn't even
exist before a year ago.

36:49.117 --> 36:51.347
You know, you're not
much of a conversationalist,

36:51.420 --> 36:53.752
so why don't you
get right to the point?

36:53.822 --> 36:55.619
Move over to that brush.

36:55.691 --> 36:56.817
No.

36:57.459 --> 36:58.892
Move.

37:11.573 --> 37:12.767
Thanks, pal.

37:12.841 --> 37:14.502
My pleasure, Michael.

37:15.811 --> 37:19.907
You know, you're a dangerous
man. You're obsessed.

37:20.015 --> 37:23.041
You got no business
carrying a badge.

38:52.240 --> 38:54.037
I can't shake the feeling,
Michael,

38:54.109 --> 38:55.542
that we ought to
cancel the party.

38:55.644 --> 38:57.271
Because if anything
goes wrong,

38:57.379 --> 38:58.937
all we'd have
succeeded in doing

38:59.047 --> 39:01.845
is turning the cat burglar
into a walking target.

39:01.917 --> 39:03.111
He already is.

39:03.185 --> 39:06.279
At least this way, we'll have
some control over what happens.

39:06.388 --> 39:07.616
I hope.

39:07.856 --> 39:10.347
Uh, speaking of the party...

39:12.794 --> 39:15.058
Yes? What is this?

39:15.430 --> 39:19.298
Uh, just little examples of the
high cost of living these days.

39:19.735 --> 39:21.168
Bills. Hmm.

39:21.303 --> 39:24.761
Valet parking?
Caterers? Orchestra?

39:25.707 --> 39:28.005
Do we really
need an orchestra?

39:54.803 --> 39:57.704
All right, beep me once
for Barth entering the area,

39:57.773 --> 40:00.503
beep me twice for anybody
scaling the building.

40:01.743 --> 40:03.768
Oh, yeah. How do you
feel about heights?

40:03.879 --> 40:06.541
They are, quite literally,
for the birds, Michael.

40:13.088 --> 40:14.783
Well, Michael Knight.

40:14.856 --> 40:16.483
How delightful
to see you.

40:16.558 --> 40:18.048
You look terrific.

40:20.328 --> 40:24.059
Uh, they're real.
Borrowed, but real.

40:25.867 --> 40:27.391
Grace, hello, how are you?

40:27.469 --> 40:28.868
Griffin,
good to see you.

40:28.937 --> 40:29.926
How do you do, sir?

40:30.005 --> 40:32.530
Griffin, Grace Fallan,
April Curtis.

40:32.607 --> 40:34.234
I'm so glad you could come.

40:34.309 --> 40:36.368
Harold will be
so pleased.

40:36.611 --> 40:40.047
Harold and April are, um,
engaged.

40:40.615 --> 40:44.073
Yes.
And I've never been happier.

40:44.186 --> 40:46.654
Well, um, ahem,
people make too much

40:46.721 --> 40:48.552
of the age difference,
I think.

40:48.623 --> 40:52.081
After all, what's a decade
or two when you're in love?

40:53.528 --> 40:58.465
I'd like you to meet
Harold Salen, my, uh, fiance.

41:01.336 --> 41:03.463
Michael Knight.
Congratulations.

41:03.538 --> 41:04.937
How do you do?

41:05.006 --> 41:06.974
And this is Grace Fallan.

41:07.242 --> 41:09.402
How do you do?

41:12.113 --> 41:13.307
And this is-

41:13.415 --> 41:15.645
Griffin.
Just Griffin, sir.

41:15.851 --> 41:17.785
How do you do, Griffin?

41:18.553 --> 41:20.783
The last I heard, you
were in prison, Mr. Salen.

41:20.856 --> 41:23.017
Yes, quite right.
Yes, indeed I was.

41:23.091 --> 41:24.456
Dreadful place.

41:24.526 --> 41:27.427
Of course, I was paroled
for good behavior.

41:29.464 --> 41:32.399
Well, uh,
may I have this dance?

41:32.467 --> 41:35.561
I hardly think that would
be polite to my date.

41:39.174 --> 41:40.835
Engaged, huh?

41:41.576 --> 41:44.670
Michael, I'm beginning
seriously to doubt your theory.

41:44.779 --> 41:47.839
Since Griffin is a guest here,
I think it's rather unlikely

41:47.949 --> 41:50.383
that he would, uh,
burglarize this place.

41:50.452 --> 41:52.511
And if the cat burglar
doesn't strike,

41:52.587 --> 41:54.919
then this whole party
will have been for nothing.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.389
For nothing?

41:56.992 --> 41:59.859
You wouldn't say that
if you had to pay the bills.

41:59.928 --> 42:01.225
Uh, may I?

42:01.296 --> 42:02.991
You certainly may.

42:03.465 --> 42:04.796
Excuse us.

42:05.901 --> 42:07.163
Oh, the bills.

42:19.648 --> 42:21.115
Lt. Barth is here.

42:21.283 --> 42:22.773
Where's Grace?

42:22.884 --> 42:24.374
And Griffin?

42:24.553 --> 42:26.043
That's a very good
question.

42:26.154 --> 42:28.588
Thank you very much
for the dance.

42:31.693 --> 42:32.682
Well.

42:36.565 --> 42:38.590
What's Barth doing, pal?

42:38.767 --> 42:41.065
Lt. Barth is circling wide.

42:41.136 --> 42:42.797
Any sign of the cat burglar?

42:42.871 --> 42:45.339
Afraid not. Wait.

42:45.407 --> 42:48.706
We just lost a burglar alarm,
Michael. And a window has just opened

42:48.777 --> 42:50.438
on the opposite side
of the building.

42:50.545 --> 42:51.534
From the outside?

42:51.646 --> 42:53.238
From the inside.

42:59.588 --> 43:01.613
My necklace. It's gone!

43:27.983 --> 43:30.747
Hold it! Stop!
Hold it! Hold it!

43:30.919 --> 43:31.886
Stop!

43:41.596 --> 43:44.224
All right, Michael.
You've caught your cat.

43:44.299 --> 43:45.596
Surprised?

43:45.667 --> 43:48.101
Grace,
what are you doing this for?

43:48.336 --> 43:50.304
I know it's Griffin.

43:51.339 --> 43:53.569
Come on,
let's get out of here.

43:56.411 --> 43:57.537
No!

44:01.683 --> 44:03.150
KITT, I need you
up here right away.

44:03.251 --> 44:04.775
Hold on, Michael. I'm coming.

44:49.931 --> 44:51.831
Get in and stay low.

44:59.574 --> 45:01.007
Here we go, KITT!

45:23.398 --> 45:26.424
You've been working the wrong
side of the law way too long.

45:26.501 --> 45:29.470
Attempted murder
is not a police procedure.

45:31.906 --> 45:34.340
Looks like
you're out of business.

45:45.086 --> 45:48.817
And so you see, sir,
before Mr. Fallan died,

45:48.890 --> 45:52.326
he gave me a list of the criminals
who deserved to be robbed.

45:52.393 --> 45:53.758
And you took it
upon yourself

45:53.828 --> 45:55.523
to carry out
his Robin Hood fantasy.

45:55.597 --> 45:57.087
I'm afraid so, sir.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.763
Oh, sorry, sir.

46:00.835 --> 46:01.961
Yeah.

46:02.036 --> 46:04.231
Once you became
convinced it was Griffin,

46:04.305 --> 46:06.705
you took it upon yourself
to protect him

46:06.808 --> 46:08.901
by taking his place
on the roof.

46:08.977 --> 46:11.537
I was afraid he'd be
caught or killed.

46:11.846 --> 46:13.905
Instead,
you almost were.

46:16.451 --> 46:17.850
Well, one good thing.

46:17.919 --> 46:19.784
All the money's
gone to charity.

46:19.854 --> 46:22.652
The Foundation has confirmed
every single penny.

46:22.724 --> 46:26.626
Yes. Well, sir, I suppose
this is the end of the line.

46:26.795 --> 46:29.992
But for what it's worth, sir,
I'm through being a cat.

46:30.064 --> 46:32.157
I much prefer
being a butler.

46:33.201 --> 46:35.829
But please, sir,
when you slap on the cuffs,

46:35.904 --> 46:37.132
not too tight.

46:37.405 --> 46:41.034
I find my circulation
isn't quite what it once was.

46:41.376 --> 46:43.606
Yeah. It's a really good thing
we were able to recover

46:43.711 --> 46:45.941
Molly Friedrich's bracelet,
isn't it?

46:46.481 --> 46:48.881
Yes. Real stroke of luck.

46:49.284 --> 46:52.947
It's too bad we couldn't catch
the cat burglar who took it.

46:55.590 --> 46:58.218
Yes, well, guess you can't
win them all.

46:58.293 --> 47:00.420
No, I guess
you can't.

47:00.895 --> 47:02.419
Goodbye, Griffin.

47:02.497 --> 47:03.964
Goodbye, sir.

47:04.065 --> 47:05.054
Goodbye, Grace.

47:09.204 --> 47:10.193
Michael,

47:15.009 --> 47:17.068
don't forget this.

47:19.714 --> 47:22.046
I'm gonna have to
keep a closer eye on you.

47:22.116 --> 47:23.845
Promise?

47:23.918 --> 47:25.749
Kisses don't lie.

47:32.260 --> 47:33.386
Bye.

47:39.667 --> 47:41.601
You know, Michael,
I've been thinking

47:41.669 --> 47:42.863
of changing my name.

47:42.937 --> 47:44.461
Oh, yeah?
What's that, pal?

47:44.539 --> 47:46.166
KITT the cat.

48:01.422 --> 48:03.356
Sorry about the other swan.

48:04.305 --> 48:10.266
