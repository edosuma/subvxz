01:49.458 --> 01:50.208
This beef

01:51.333 --> 01:53.583
is cooked best by the heat from
a 10 cm thick steel hibachi stove.

01:57.583 --> 01:58.458
Mr. Lu,

01:58.458 --> 02:00.958
my people waited 2 hours for you,

02:01.042 --> 02:02.417
only for me to wait

02:02.458 --> 02:04.250
another 30 minutes for you to eat.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.458
In that time,

02:05.500 --> 02:08.458
I could have acquired another hotel for the company.

02:09.458 --> 02:10.583
So, you think

02:10.708 --> 02:15.167
you are more worthy than Tajima wagyu beef?

02:16.458 --> 02:17.708
Thank you.

02:17.792 --> 02:19.583
You're fired!

02:21.000 --> 02:22.333
- I'm sorry--
- Stop.

02:24.208 --> 02:27.125
I hate listening to apologies.

02:27.208 --> 02:28.333
Your apology

02:28.417 --> 02:30.792
asks me to play Mr. Nice Guy,

02:30.917 --> 02:32.833
to let you get away with your faults

02:33.375 --> 02:35.917
while you have never found a hotel

02:36.000 --> 02:37.750
that is worthy of my time.

02:45.458 --> 02:46.625
Cheaters!

02:46.750 --> 02:47.625
She's in his arms.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.500
Don't worry, I'll make sure they pay.

02:49.583 --> 02:50.500
Shengnan,

02:50.583 --> 02:51.583
you're such a good friend.

02:51.958 --> 02:53.458
It's a black Q7, right?

02:53.542 --> 02:54.625
Yeah, black Audi.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.333
2nd floor?

02:56.417 --> 02:57.500
Yeah, 2nd floor.

02:57.583 --> 02:58.500
2nd floor.

02:58.625 --> 03:00.458
A messed up car is what he deserves.

03:00.458 --> 03:02.542
I'm on top of it, so I can scratch deeper.

03:02.625 --> 03:04.792
I'm coming to join you.

03:04.917 --> 03:05.792
Deeper.

03:19.917 --> 03:21.208
This is personal.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.250
Get lost!

03:24.208 --> 03:25.458
Filming me is illegal!

03:25.458 --> 03:26.542
Delete the footage!

03:26.625 --> 03:27.500
Delete it!

03:28.417 --> 03:29.333
Delete it!

03:30.458 --> 03:31.583
Look up.

03:40.958 --> 03:42.458
That's another piece of evidence.

03:45.375 --> 03:46.375
Who are you?

03:49.500 --> 03:51.125
Did you grab the wrong keys?

03:51.750 --> 03:52.708
Who are you?

03:52.792 --> 03:55.458
I'm here, where are you?

03:55.542 --> 03:57.250
There's not a scratch on his car!

03:57.375 --> 03:58.708
Are you on the right floor?

03:59.125 --> 04:00.458
I said the 2nd floor!

04:00.500 --> 04:02.458
Second!

04:02.500 --> 04:03.792
Where are you?

04:05.458 --> 04:06.375
Police or hospital?

04:06.458 --> 04:07.208
I'm sorry, really sorry.

04:07.333 --> 04:08.417
Sir--

04:08.458 --> 04:09.625
Do not apologize to me.

04:13.375 --> 04:14.583
I can fix this.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.458
Let me show you.

04:17.791 --> 04:18.458
Look.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.542
See!

04:26.417 --> 04:27.250
Hospital it is.

04:27.458 --> 04:28.458
Don't!

04:28.625 --> 04:30.333
Don't call them.

04:30.417 --> 04:31.542
I'm a woman of my word.

04:31.625 --> 04:33.583
I'll get it repainted; it'll be just like new!

04:33.708 --> 04:34.792
I swear.

04:38.042 --> 04:39.208
Yes, the car can be repainted,

04:39.333 --> 04:40.750
but what about the insult?

04:44.500 --> 04:46.042
You can insult me.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.375
Call this car repair shop at 12.

04:54.458 --> 04:55.750
If you haven't called by 12:10,

04:57.000 --> 04:58.625
I'll call the police.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.458
Where's my key, Boss?

05:36.792 --> 05:37.958
Thanks, Boss.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.458
Moroccan pigeon tagine.

07:07.542 --> 07:08.458
Yum.

07:09.458 --> 07:10.125
It's good.

07:10.167 --> 07:11.375
It's unique.

07:12.125 --> 07:12.917
You know

07:13.458 --> 07:14.708
how I like meat,

07:15.917 --> 07:16.792
dislike anything bland.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.458
That's why I picked pigeon.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.500
Even though it's small,

07:19.583 --> 07:20.458
it is in fact

07:20.542 --> 07:21.500
very meaty.

07:21.583 --> 07:22.792
There is still some on your face.

07:23.125 --> 07:23.917
Let me get it for you.

07:26.458 --> 07:28.167
I'm not talking about the pigeon,

07:28.250 --> 07:29.167
I talking about--

07:30.583 --> 07:31.750
Gu Shengnan,

07:31.833 --> 07:33.417
stop asking me to taste your dishes.

07:33.458 --> 07:34.958
Do you know how wrong that is?

07:36.042 --> 07:37.250
I'm sorry, general manager;

07:37.375 --> 07:38.750
I will not do this again.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.417
Should I lock the door?

07:41.708 --> 07:42.583
Wait.

07:43.417 --> 07:44.708
I've been thinking.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.708
Should we

07:46.792 --> 07:48.958
take another look at our relationship?

07:57.250 --> 07:59.375
Do you want to tell everyone about our relationship?

07:59.542 --> 08:01.625
Didn't you say

08:01.750 --> 08:04.917
it will affect our careers if we came out?

08:05.042 --> 08:06.458
We're not telling anyone.

08:06.917 --> 08:07.833
We're splitting up.

08:11.042 --> 08:12.000
Shengnan,

08:12.417 --> 08:13.917
I love your dishes

08:14.000 --> 08:15.458
but...

08:17.458 --> 08:18.917
you're not my dish.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.042
I like meat.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.417
You have none even in places you should.

08:26.458 --> 08:27.750
I don't mind vegetables.

08:27.833 --> 08:30.417
Shengnan, look...

08:30.458 --> 08:31.792
Eggplants,

08:31.917 --> 08:32.792
Pumpkins,

08:32.917 --> 08:34.375
even fuzzy melons;

08:34.457 --> 08:36.457
they've got a meaty inside.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.832
But you

08:38.832 --> 08:39.917
are garlic chives.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.250
Like these,

08:43.375 --> 08:44.625
ones without fertilizer.

08:47.417 --> 08:48.208
Shengnan,

08:48.958 --> 08:50.542
I hope I didn't hurt you with my honesty.

08:52.542 --> 08:53.708
But don't give up.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.417
A lot of people out there like garlic chives.

08:56.458 --> 08:57.458
Plus--

08:57.458 --> 08:58.333
Go away.

09:05.750 --> 09:06.833
Now.

09:23.458 --> 09:24.125
Are you here yet?

09:24.208 --> 09:26.167
Just checked into room 1123.

09:26.417 --> 09:27.458
I need a little time.

09:27.458 --> 09:28.417
Hurry up!

09:29.042 --> 09:31.125
Can I help you, sir?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.708
Take my luggage to room 1123.

09:33.792 --> 09:34.500
Yes.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.542
Take the luggage to room 1123!

09:37.750 --> 09:39.750
Let me take you upstairs, sir.

09:40.583 --> 09:41.500
It's alright.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.250
I'm fine.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.167
I don't need a chaperone.

09:49.375 --> 09:50.375
Hello, sir.

09:50.458 --> 09:51.333
I'm Berry.

09:51.417 --> 09:52.250
I'm Gladys.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.458
We're very glad to be of your service.

09:56.417 --> 09:57.250
No.

09:58.167 --> 09:59.417
Stop following me!

10:04.958 --> 10:06.125
No one has lived here for some time.

10:06.208 --> 10:06.958
It smells moldy.

10:07.042 --> 10:09.375
Take your mask off, I can't hear you.

10:09.458 --> 10:10.417
The room is up to standard;

10:10.458 --> 10:12.833
the lighting and humidity is comfortable.

10:14.208 --> 10:15.625
It's not 100% light proof.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.208
What about sound proof?

10:19.917 --> 10:20.542
Excellent.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.458
There's also a restaurant, you need to try.

10:35.583 --> 10:39.000
VN GROUP LOOKS TO BUYOUT
TRADITIONAL HOTELS IN SHANGHAI

10:39.125 --> 10:42.333
DEMANDING CEO, LU JIN,
HAS ARRIVED IN PERSON

10:45.208 --> 10:46.208
Come on.

10:47.042 --> 10:48.375
Lightly, quietly.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.208
Hurry up!

10:57.542 --> 10:58.708
Beef Wellington

10:59.417 --> 11:00.542
Please, bon apetit.

11:03.458 --> 11:04.500
Our head chef

11:04.583 --> 11:06.458
was from a Michelin restaurant,

11:07.125 --> 11:10.042
pretty well known in this part of town.

11:24.333 --> 11:27.167
The duxelles between the pastry and steak

11:27.250 --> 11:29.458
should be made with button mushroom

11:29.458 --> 11:31.500
but he used portobello.

11:32.542 --> 11:34.375
Michelin?

11:58.458 --> 11:59.458
They were all rejected.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.208
Big guy,

12:02.333 --> 12:04.792
can you cook a dish that's off menu?

12:05.042 --> 12:06.250
Boss, how can something improvised now

12:06.375 --> 12:07.583
be better than these dishes?

12:07.792 --> 12:09.625
All 15 recipes were meticulously followed.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.917
They've been tasted by tens
of thousands of customers.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.583
Even if the head chef were here,

12:14.708 --> 12:16.917
he would nod and say "Perfecto."

12:17.000 --> 12:19.458
Why did the guest reject the dishes?

12:19.458 --> 12:20.750
He said a lot,

12:20.833 --> 12:22.042
but I didn't understand a word of it.

12:22.458 --> 12:23.458
Maybe he's got a cold and

12:23.500 --> 12:24.708
couldn't taste a thing.

12:33.792 --> 12:34.458
Shengnan,

12:34.708 --> 12:35.917
help me out.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.458
Do whatever you can

12:37.625 --> 12:39.000
to please the guest in room 1123

12:39.375 --> 12:41.208
before he checks out at 12.

12:43.167 --> 12:43.708
Boss,

12:43.792 --> 12:44.917
with just 20 minutes

12:45.000 --> 12:47.125
she couldn't even make a salad.

13:01.167 --> 13:02.542
Non kitchen staff please leave.

13:05.417 --> 13:06.375
The Rosebud is small

13:06.458 --> 13:07.417
but it's in a prime location

13:07.458 --> 13:09.542
with an interesting history about the building itself.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.125
It should be part of our acquisition plan.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.958
Can I send this to the board?

13:13.458 --> 13:15.417
Send someone to negotiate right away.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.125
We can drive their price down.

13:17.208 --> 13:18.458
Since the hotel is poorly run,

13:19.125 --> 13:20.333
they have no room to bargain.

13:24.458 --> 13:25.333
Check out.

13:30.792 --> 13:31.708
Hello,

13:32.125 --> 13:33.458
I'm the General Manager.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.458
Sorry for our negligence.

13:35.958 --> 13:37.917
We've prepared a new dish;

13:38.375 --> 13:39.542
we would love to have your comments.

13:45.042 --> 13:46.583
- This is--
- I know.

13:49.708 --> 13:52.042
Spaghetti alla Strega.

14:08.375 --> 14:09.458
How come it's clean?

14:09.458 --> 14:11.333
I told you I want to see the leftovers.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.458
I didn't touch it;

14:12.458 --> 14:13.625
he ate it all.

14:25.167 --> 14:28.333
The way this hotel has been running,

14:28.458 --> 14:30.375
you should have been fired.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.458
I would have never thought that

14:32.458 --> 14:34.458
a talented female chef worked here.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.500
How do you know the chef is a woman?

14:39.167 --> 14:41.167
This is a special Romani dish,

14:41.333 --> 14:43.583
only passed onto the women in the family.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.458
The seasoning is difficult.

14:46.458 --> 14:50.458
She even dared to replace lemon with lemongrass.

14:50.458 --> 14:55.000
By using lemongrass,
she made the dish appropriate for the season.

14:55.458 --> 14:58.042
Warm red wine represents the winter.

14:58.167 --> 14:59.250
Winter

14:59.375 --> 15:02.000
is when Romani women like to heat up an iron pot

15:02.458 --> 15:04.458
and boil this strong flavored,

15:04.500 --> 15:07.167
aromatic Strega sauce.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.250
There is no strict recipe;

15:09.375 --> 15:11.458
the ingredients and the amount used

15:11.458 --> 15:12.958
are different from person to person.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.708
It's unique

15:17.792 --> 15:20.583
with a very well-balanced taste.

15:24.750 --> 15:25.833
Thank you,

15:27.333 --> 15:28.458
Mr. Lu.

15:39.125 --> 15:40.708
Everyone is programmed with a different code.

15:41.167 --> 15:43.208
Food is the key to the deciphering that code.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.000
The picky eater

15:45.125 --> 15:46.917
doesn't just care about taste,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.375
they care whether or not

15:48.458 --> 15:51.458
a chef can aptly unlock their desires.

16:02.125 --> 16:02.958
Attention.

16:04.458 --> 16:07.250
I can confirm the guest in 1123

16:07.417 --> 16:10.792
is the CEO of VN Group.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.458
"Awaiting more pleasant surprises.
-1123"

16:12.542 --> 16:14.958
So, each one of you

16:15.042 --> 16:17.333
needs to be at your best.

16:17.458 --> 16:18.625
Especially you,

16:18.833 --> 16:20.042
Gu Shengnan.

16:26.958 --> 16:28.042
Inform them

16:28.167 --> 16:29.833
her cooking is the only thing

16:30.458 --> 16:31.917
I'm eating from now on.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.458
From now on?

16:33.583 --> 16:34.792
So, we're not leaving?

16:37.208 --> 16:38.958
Postpone everything else.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.000
It's been a tough day.

16:48.250 --> 16:49.917
Smile.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.250
Instant noodles are the best for sleepless nights.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.000
When water boils at 100Â°C,

18:16.458 --> 18:18.458
the aroma will evaporate.

18:18.833 --> 18:21.000
Noodles are cooked in 3 minutes.

18:21.125 --> 18:24.000
The best is when it is al dente.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.000
Perfection is gone in a flash,

18:28.500 --> 18:32.375
but numbers can help capture perfection.

18:34.833 --> 18:36.708
Ecstasy is not at the peak,

18:36.792 --> 18:39.042
but in the anticipation of it.

18:39.167 --> 18:41.792
The key is knowing how to control it.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.708
Time is the enemy of noodles.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.042
The noodles from one second to the next

18:49.208 --> 18:52.000
are completely different.

19:53.042 --> 19:54.333
Who's there?

19:58.750 --> 19:59.458
You?

20:01.458 --> 20:03.125
I should have called the police!

20:03.333 --> 20:04.375
Why are you on my balcony?

20:07.208 --> 20:09.167
Can you not talk so loud?

20:09.625 --> 20:11.042
Why are you shouting?

20:11.250 --> 20:12.625
You know what time it is?

20:15.500 --> 20:17.458
I will climb back up, okay?

20:18.708 --> 20:19.458
What?

20:25.375 --> 20:26.458
What are you doing?

20:26.458 --> 20:27.458
I...

20:27.458 --> 20:28.958
I better climb down instead.

20:29.042 --> 20:30.333
I'm going down.

20:31.000 --> 20:31.792
down

20:32.125 --> 20:32.833
Hey!

20:47.333 --> 20:48.167
Let go!

20:49.542 --> 20:52.208
Why was I dumped?

20:53.917 --> 20:55.792
Am I extremely...

20:55.917 --> 20:56.708
ugly?

20:57.250 --> 20:58.917
If you don't tell me,

20:59.458 --> 21:00.792
I won't let go.

21:05.917 --> 21:06.917
Well... Ugly...

21:11.375 --> 21:12.792
Ugliness is no tragedy.

21:12.958 --> 21:14.917
The tragedy is you're not ugly enough.

21:15.458 --> 21:17.458
Being repulsive or gorgeous

21:17.958 --> 21:19.417
are both special.

21:19.958 --> 21:21.208
But someone like you,

21:21.333 --> 21:22.458
who's just an ordinary type of ugly,

21:22.542 --> 21:23.708
is bland.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.458
Don't cry.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.333
I understand.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.500
I'll leave.

21:47.375 --> 21:48.042
Hey!

22:41.042 --> 22:42.542
Am I ugly?

22:50.458 --> 22:51.333
Eh...

22:51.417 --> 22:53.250
Can you turn up the air conditioning?

22:55.417 --> 22:56.417
When can I go?

22:56.458 --> 22:59.458
I hate criminals like you.

22:59.542 --> 23:01.042
A good-looking guy like yourself

23:01.167 --> 23:03.333
still playing silly games in hotel rooms.

23:03.833 --> 23:05.167
Sit back down!

23:19.625 --> 23:20.583
Hey!

23:20.833 --> 23:21.625
What're you doing?

23:22.250 --> 23:23.458
No flavor powder,

23:23.958 --> 23:24.917
cook the noodles first.

23:26.042 --> 23:27.417
Watch the clock.

23:39.000 --> 23:39.792
Cover it.

23:45.958 --> 23:46.958
Not yet.

23:49.458 --> 23:50.583
Alright, go.

23:51.042 --> 23:52.167
Drain the water.

23:56.333 --> 23:57.208
Everything in.

23:59.458 --> 24:00.583
Hurry up, mix.

24:01.750 --> 24:02.750
Right.

24:03.833 --> 24:04.958
Mix it up!

24:06.458 --> 24:07.583
Pour the water,

24:08.458 --> 24:09.708
80% full.

24:10.833 --> 24:11.708
Enough.

24:12.917 --> 24:13.917
Wait.

24:22.042 --> 24:23.250
Eat.

24:32.500 --> 24:33.750
This is delicious;

24:33.833 --> 24:35.458
you have some talent at this.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.042
What're you doing?

24:41.708 --> 24:43.417
Sit back down.

24:55.458 --> 24:57.458
Hello, this is Richard Meng.

24:57.792 --> 25:00.458
I didn't agree to the purchase of GB Airways.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.458
I'm the one in charge of this project.

25:02.917 --> 25:03.500
No...

25:03.583 --> 25:06.208
I don't think being young, capable, and single

25:06.333 --> 25:07.500
is a hindrance.

25:10.750 --> 25:13.458
You could tell it was a fake call, right?

25:13.500 --> 25:14.750
Not bad.

25:15.167 --> 25:15.958
Pretty creative.

25:16.042 --> 25:16.958
Care to give me your number, then?

25:17.042 --> 25:18.458
I'll call you for real.

25:18.542 --> 25:19.958
It's alright, you have it already.

25:20.458 --> 25:22.583
I was one of the girls who vandalized your boss' car.

25:23.958 --> 25:26.208
I just called you.

25:30.625 --> 25:31.458
What's wrong?

25:31.458 --> 25:32.708
Don't...

25:35.458 --> 25:38.167
To be honest, he's quite good looking.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.583
Let's go and apologize.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.458
Sir,

25:46.042 --> 25:48.208
my friend has caused you so much trouble;

25:48.333 --> 25:49.500
she wants to apologize.

25:49.833 --> 25:52.458
I hate listening to apologies.

25:58.417 --> 25:59.000
Hey,

26:00.250 --> 26:01.333
stop right there.

26:02.250 --> 26:03.458
You're a germaphobe, right?

26:03.458 --> 26:05.542
Yes, what's your point?

26:07.208 --> 26:09.250
When you came out,

26:09.708 --> 26:11.000
you stepped on some...

26:11.125 --> 26:12.208
dog poo.

26:16.708 --> 26:19.542
How many more surprises do you have for me?

26:24.333 --> 26:25.375
Hey, open the door!

26:26.250 --> 26:27.042
Wait!

26:29.208 --> 26:30.125
Go!

26:36.333 --> 26:39.417
Can you get our umbrella for us?

26:39.458 --> 26:42.625
You can do it!

26:42.750 --> 26:48.125
Go for it!

26:50.917 --> 26:52.958
Is this pond used for cultivating bacteria?

26:53.042 --> 26:54.042
It's so dirty.

26:54.458 --> 26:55.208
Alright, I've made a note.

26:55.333 --> 26:56.458
What's next?

26:56.583 --> 26:59.458
Bangkok's hotel staff
of excellence awards meeting at 8.

27:00.833 --> 27:03.000
They are all equally bad
and we're giving them awards for excellence?

27:05.458 --> 27:06.208
Damn!

27:09.417 --> 27:09.958
Run!

27:10.042 --> 27:11.125
Man in the suit!

27:15.042 --> 27:15.958
Run!

27:24.208 --> 27:26.417
Sir, we're sorry.

27:28.250 --> 27:30.583
We are sorry.

27:31.833 --> 27:33.458
Sorry.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.458
It must hurt. Are you OK?

27:43.125 --> 27:44.208
I'm sorry.

27:46.458 --> 27:47.458
You're on staff here?

27:48.333 --> 27:49.458
Which department?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.458
Are you going to file a complaint?

27:52.958 --> 27:53.917
Never mind.

27:54.458 --> 27:55.542
Give me your hand.

27:57.917 --> 27:58.917
Meng,

27:59.208 --> 28:00.458
give her your watch.

28:02.333 --> 28:03.500
This watch has an alarm.

28:03.583 --> 28:05.458
When you're within 50 meters of my boss,

28:05.500 --> 28:06.792
it'll give out an alert.

28:06.958 --> 28:08.333
We hope you can keep it on

28:08.417 --> 28:10.833
twenty-four seven.

28:11.458 --> 28:13.417
You'll do the same, right?

28:15.458 --> 28:17.625
I just mean we'll both be safe.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.583
Boss, it's 8.

28:24.542 --> 28:27.583
(Thai) Welcome to the great CEO, Mr. Lu!

28:30.792 --> 28:31.625
Turn a little more this way.

28:31.792 --> 28:32.750
A little bit more.

28:33.458 --> 28:34.458
OK!

28:38.458 --> 28:42.250
(Thai) Mr. Lu will lead us in the right direction.

28:43.792 --> 28:45.167
(Thai) Hello

28:50.208 --> 28:56.208
(Thai)

28:58.417 --> 28:59.833
Hurry up!

29:00.625 --> 29:02.167
Order from 1123

29:04.458 --> 29:05.458
- Egg?
- Correct.

29:05.458 --> 29:06.250
Just one word?

29:09.458 --> 29:10.750
So many dishes?

29:20.917 --> 29:22.458
Is it by the same chef?

29:22.750 --> 29:24.208
Yes.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.750
Interesting.

29:54.458 --> 29:55.792
I hope you're enjoying this

29:56.042 --> 29:57.458
because I'm gonna take you down!

30:51.458 --> 30:52.625
Enough is enough.

30:57.625 --> 30:59.583
What is that?

31:00.458 --> 31:02.458
She used squid ink.

31:02.833 --> 31:07.000
Squids release ink when they escape.

31:07.417 --> 31:08.208
Then

31:08.458 --> 31:09.958
she's surrendering.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.458
Is 1123 mad?

31:23.917 --> 31:25.000
Messed around the whole day.

31:37.458 --> 31:38.792
I've been lifting weights.

31:41.417 --> 31:42.375
Touch it.

31:43.500 --> 31:44.542
No, thank you.

31:44.792 --> 31:46.333
I like things bland, too.

31:48.458 --> 31:49.292
Shengnan,

31:51.333 --> 31:52.167
help me.

31:53.208 --> 31:54.500
With what?

31:55.458 --> 31:56.542
My trainer said

31:56.750 --> 31:59.250
I shouldn't eat fatty foods while training.

31:59.792 --> 32:00.792
We've split up;

32:00.917 --> 32:02.750
I won't cook for you anymore.

32:02.917 --> 32:04.500
I don't need you to cook.

32:04.917 --> 32:07.000
It's just, I've discovered there are things

32:07.125 --> 32:09.458
that are healthy but taste bland.

32:09.833 --> 32:12.000
Like skimmed milk,

32:12.167 --> 32:13.167
Diet Coke,

32:13.625 --> 32:14.833
vegan chicken,

32:15.458 --> 32:16.625
then of course, you.

32:17.500 --> 32:18.583
You're so healthy;

32:18.750 --> 32:20.458
yet I've been ignoring you.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.417
Let's go to your place tonight.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.167
Alright.

32:30.792 --> 32:31.792
Let me get my car.

32:33.750 --> 32:34.917
Wait!

32:35.917 --> 32:37.208
You like meat, right?

32:37.375 --> 32:38.333
Here's meat for you!

32:38.417 --> 32:39.000
Buns and wieners,

32:39.125 --> 32:40.208
a match made in heaven!

32:40.333 --> 32:41.042
All for you!

32:41.208 --> 32:42.458
Don't speak to me again!

32:43.208 --> 32:44.333
Shengnan.

32:50.458 --> 32:51.333
Chef Gu,

32:51.458 --> 32:52.042
we're off.

32:52.167 --> 32:53.625
1123 said he's done ordering.

32:53.917 --> 32:54.708
What?

33:05.125 --> 33:06.750
YOU'RE NOT A SQUID. DON'T RUN.

33:06.833 --> 33:09.958
STAY. BE MY WORTHY OPPONENT.

33:16.250 --> 33:17.792
This guy really knows his food.

33:17.958 --> 33:19.750
He won't be impressed by ordinary dishes.

33:22.458 --> 33:23.333
Be quick

33:23.417 --> 33:25.458
so we can go home and create new dishes.

33:30.458 --> 33:31.458
Here again?

33:31.458 --> 33:32.750
Didn't I tell you to go elsewhere?

33:33.333 --> 33:34.458
Hurry up.

33:35.208 --> 33:36.583
Hello, foodies!

33:36.792 --> 33:38.458
My show, "Yummy Eats with Hottie"

33:38.500 --> 33:39.958
on mogujie.com

33:40.042 --> 33:41.708
has over 200,000 subscribers!

33:42.125 --> 33:43.458
Let's keep working together.

33:43.542 --> 33:45.458
Say bye bye, Boss.

33:48.417 --> 33:49.042
Bye bye.

33:49.917 --> 33:52.125
Is your dog a misogynist?

33:52.250 --> 33:53.542
Or does he just like boys?

33:53.625 --> 33:55.958
Maybe he doesn't like the way you talk.

33:56.125 --> 33:58.917
You know that's my show voice.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.125
Popularity online fades fast.

34:01.583 --> 34:03.458
So, while I'm still popular,

34:03.750 --> 34:04.792
I need to build up my fan base

34:05.458 --> 34:07.042
and turn my fame into real money.

34:07.375 --> 34:09.458
When can I live with real freedom?

34:09.542 --> 34:11.458
Look at how free I am.

34:11.458 --> 34:12.750
It's just an illusion.

34:12.917 --> 34:14.458
I'm sure your parents
are pushing you to get married.

34:14.542 --> 34:16.167
They gave up on me long ago.

34:16.333 --> 34:18.500
My cousin, she's 33.

34:18.792 --> 34:21.333
But no one pushes her to get married

34:21.417 --> 34:23.458
because she has two apartments.

34:23.917 --> 34:25.542
One in Beijing and one in her hometown.

34:26.958 --> 34:28.958
Real freedom comes with money.

34:29.417 --> 34:30.375
I'm working hard,

34:30.458 --> 34:33.042
working hard to get approval from 1123.

34:33.167 --> 34:35.250
1123?

34:35.583 --> 34:36.583
Who is this?

34:39.458 --> 34:40.917
is someone who can get me a promotion.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.458
When he buys the hotel,

34:42.583 --> 34:43.792
I'll become the head chef.

34:43.917 --> 34:46.458
That's an ambitious career plan, missy.

34:46.792 --> 34:48.958
But all it looks like to me
is that someone likes your dishes

34:49.125 --> 34:50.458
and again you've fallen for him.

34:52.417 --> 34:53.500
He doesn't just "like" my food;

34:53.583 --> 34:55.042
he really understands my dishes.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.125
I feel like

34:57.458 --> 34:58.750
we're the same type of people.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.458
Mr. Gao,

35:05.125 --> 35:06.208
Mr. Lu is refusing to record the video clips.

35:06.333 --> 35:07.583
He thinks our lines are tacky.

35:08.750 --> 35:09.833
Didn't you tell him

35:10.208 --> 35:11.333
our show

35:11.458 --> 35:14.333
is sleazy, vulgar,

35:14.417 --> 35:15.333
and shameless?

35:15.417 --> 35:16.000
I told him.

35:16.125 --> 35:17.917
He said since you're so shameless,

35:18.000 --> 35:19.833
why do you spend so much time on makeup?

35:20.458 --> 35:21.167
He's over there.

35:22.208 --> 35:23.458
That large man over there?

35:23.708 --> 35:25.917
His name literally means tall, rich, and handsome.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.333
All the hottest shows online are hosted by him.

35:29.625 --> 35:31.708
Let's see what our viewers like.

35:33.625 --> 35:35.458
Is it true you suffer from depression?

35:36.417 --> 35:38.333
Is your relationship with your father tense?

35:38.417 --> 35:40.417
How many girlfriends have you had?

35:40.708 --> 35:41.458
Or maybe...

35:42.000 --> 35:43.167
boyfriends?

35:45.167 --> 35:47.250
Your show is just a representation

35:47.375 --> 35:48.750
of how normal people think.

35:49.167 --> 35:50.625
Wishing rich people

35:50.750 --> 35:52.417
were born out of wedlock,

35:52.458 --> 35:53.625
were promiscuous,

35:53.750 --> 35:55.333
were lonely and unloved

35:55.458 --> 35:56.917
with a traumatized childhood.

35:57.417 --> 35:59.417
If I tell you how good my life is

35:59.458 --> 36:00.833
your viewers won't believe it.

36:01.167 --> 36:05.417
Only tragedy will bring people closer together.

36:05.792 --> 36:06.750
So our research is wrong?

36:07.208 --> 36:08.417
You did not have a traumatizing childhood?

36:08.542 --> 36:09.958
Your name means tall, rich, and handsome.

36:10.042 --> 36:12.833
You should be the one with a traumatizing childhood.

36:15.833 --> 36:17.208
No wonder our viewers call you

36:17.458 --> 36:18.458
Mr. Blowfish.

36:18.458 --> 36:19.958
You're poisonous.

36:20.125 --> 36:21.208
This is a small gift from us.

36:21.250 --> 36:21.833
Close up.

36:21.917 --> 36:22.708
Come on, hurry up.

36:22.792 --> 36:23.500
Close up.

36:25.125 --> 36:27.000
Blowfish are poisonous,

36:27.333 --> 36:30.625
but only ignorant people bite into them.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.375
He's a celebrity?

36:32.917 --> 36:34.250
Mr. Lu, you are so wealthy.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.583
Why don't you just buy our company?

36:36.708 --> 36:38.750
It's just one billion dollars.

36:38.958 --> 36:40.542
I like to buy

36:40.625 --> 36:43.208
hotels like Rosebud.

36:43.458 --> 36:45.542
To keep in line with the luxury

36:45.792 --> 36:47.250
branding of the VN Group.

36:47.375 --> 36:48.500
Buyout?

36:49.208 --> 36:51.750
I can confirm the guest in room 1123

36:51.833 --> 36:54.458
is the CEO of VN Group.

36:54.833 --> 36:56.250
I see.

37:05.833 --> 37:07.167
What about in the middle of the night when

37:07.250 --> 37:09.458
you stuffed a woman into a suitcase

37:09.458 --> 37:11.125
and dragged her outside of your room?

37:12.458 --> 37:13.500
What happened?

37:13.625 --> 37:14.458
A misunderstanding.

37:14.750 --> 37:15.542
What misunderstanding?

37:15.792 --> 37:17.000
I don't think it is.

37:18.375 --> 37:19.375
We have a viewer who captured you

37:19.458 --> 37:21.167
getting arrested in the middle of the night.

37:22.583 --> 37:24.375
Was that to keep a distance

37:24.458 --> 37:25.708
from peasants like us?

37:25.833 --> 37:27.375
It was a real misunderstanding.

37:27.625 --> 37:29.208
Were you having too much fun?

37:30.458 --> 37:31.583
Hey, what're you doing?

37:38.042 --> 37:39.458
All the videos and photos online

37:39.500 --> 37:40.417
have been taken down.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.333
And they promised not to say anything about it,

37:42.917 --> 37:44.917
but they want something in exchange.

37:46.125 --> 37:47.958
I'm Lu Jin, I wish all of you

37:48.042 --> 37:49.250
a Happy Valentine's Day.

37:49.375 --> 37:51.375
To those without a valentine, don't give up.

37:51.458 --> 37:52.917
Look to the future with a big heart.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
I wish you well.

37:54.125 --> 37:55.208
Alright, the next one.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.458
I'm Lu Jin, I wish all of you

37:57.500 --> 37:58.583
a Happy Remembrance Day.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.458
Remember those who have passed.

38:00.542 --> 38:02.708
Don't be upset by the ones lost.

38:03.458 --> 38:04.042
Mr. Lu, Mr. Lu,

38:04.167 --> 38:06.125
the blowfish needs to be higher.

38:07.167 --> 38:08.708
Hello, I'm Lu Jin,

38:09.500 --> 38:11.458
I wish all of you a Happy Chinese New Year.

38:21.792 --> 38:24.542
1123 says the theme is open to interpretation.

38:24.917 --> 38:27.542
So put your own spin on it.

38:27.708 --> 38:29.250
Our own spin?

38:31.417 --> 38:33.417
A TIME A PLACE A MOMENT

38:35.167 --> 38:36.500
This is your first dish.

38:36.750 --> 38:37.750
A Time.

38:45.542 --> 38:47.500
For me, summer is about passion

38:47.708 --> 38:49.708
exploding like fireworks.

38:49.833 --> 38:53.958
Barbecue accompanied by Argentine chili sauce

38:54.250 --> 38:56.333
gives a rustic aroma.

38:57.542 --> 38:59.958
Your chef is in a mood today.

39:05.542 --> 39:06.625
Rosemary.

39:08.625 --> 39:10.500
This aroma of Rosemary is...

39:10.583 --> 39:13.167
A mysterious lighthouse by the sea

39:13.458 --> 39:16.042
is an apt description of Shanghai.

39:16.208 --> 39:17.708
A chef and their patron,

39:17.958 --> 39:19.167
because of one dish,

39:19.375 --> 39:20.833
can make a connection.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.708
Even though he doesn't know who I am,

39:22.833 --> 39:24.708
I hope he will remember this moment.

39:27.542 --> 39:30.458
The third dish, French style lamb chops.

39:32.333 --> 39:35.250
This dish is "A Moment."

39:35.375 --> 39:37.792
We are at the center of the French Concession.

39:37.917 --> 39:41.250
It reflects the history of our hotel.

39:43.625 --> 39:46.750
What makes the lamb chops pop is the sauce.

39:46.958 --> 39:51.958
She used matcha powder to give a fresh aroma.

39:53.250 --> 39:54.333
Matcha?

39:54.708 --> 39:57.458
She's expressing the spirit
of the Japanese tea ceremony.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.500
"Once in a lifetime."

40:02.542 --> 40:04.250
A Moment.

40:26.542 --> 40:30.417
Dishes according to your theme have been made;

40:30.625 --> 40:33.625
our chef wishes to present her own theme.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.167
American almonds,

40:53.250 --> 40:55.000
Canadian blueberries,

40:55.125 --> 40:56.458
British gooseberries,

40:58.625 --> 41:00.333
very detailed research.

41:01.792 --> 41:05.833
I was born in the US, grew up in Canada,
studied and worked in the UK.

41:07.125 --> 41:09.542
Tell her this is called, "An Existence."

41:11.583 --> 41:14.458
Our chef put a lot of thought into it.

41:16.125 --> 41:17.917
There's also truffle.

41:18.458 --> 41:20.250
Why the truffle?

41:21.417 --> 41:23.792
It's white truffle from Alba, Italy.

41:23.917 --> 41:26.833
It's 50 euros per gram, our most expensive ingredient.

41:27.167 --> 41:29.917
It is to reflect your noble background.

41:35.042 --> 41:36.917
I'd like to meet the chef.

41:38.333 --> 41:39.458
What was his reaction?

41:39.500 --> 41:40.458
He got it all

41:40.917 --> 41:42.458
except the meaning of the white truffle.

41:42.708 --> 41:44.625
He wants to ask you in person.

41:46.583 --> 41:47.708
Sure.

42:09.042 --> 42:10.250
She doesn't want to meet you.

42:10.458 --> 42:13.208
But you've already guessed what it means.

42:13.542 --> 42:15.000
As to the truffle,

42:15.125 --> 42:16.792
they grow underground.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.042
Anything growing nearby dies instantly,

42:20.417 --> 42:22.042
signaling its location.

42:22.167 --> 42:25.125
Which is to say, truffle kills those around it

42:25.208 --> 42:27.208
to become the most expensive ingredient.

42:44.542 --> 42:45.500
The chef said

42:45.583 --> 42:48.167
you two had good exchanges over dishes.

42:48.458 --> 42:50.042
As to meeting in person...

43:24.208 --> 43:24.750
Hey.

43:24.792 --> 43:26.833
Boss, I can't make it tonight.

43:27.750 --> 43:28.750
Where are you?

43:29.458 --> 43:30.625
I'm at the mechanic;

43:30.750 --> 43:32.458
there's a long line.

43:32.542 --> 43:34.167
Hey, this hotel looks nice.

43:34.250 --> 43:35.208
Should we go?

43:35.333 --> 43:36.000
Shh...

43:36.125 --> 43:36.958
Slow down.

43:37.458 --> 43:38.250
Who is it?

43:40.542 --> 43:42.458
If there's nothing else, I better get in line.

43:42.542 --> 43:44.958
Alright, later.

44:06.125 --> 44:06.917
Hey!

44:09.708 --> 44:11.333
It's you again?

44:13.125 --> 44:13.833
No battery.

44:14.042 --> 44:15.458
Why are you following me?

44:15.458 --> 44:16.750
I see you everywhere I go.

44:17.417 --> 44:18.917
You're like a fly.

44:21.458 --> 44:23.333
I guess you are poo then.

44:28.542 --> 44:29.583
Don't move.

44:32.208 --> 44:33.417
Move your hands.

44:33.750 --> 44:34.833
Move them!

44:49.583 --> 44:51.458
How come... you are...

44:57.333 --> 44:58.500
You are

44:58.583 --> 45:00.583
a messy eater!

45:01.625 --> 45:03.125
Even flies are cleaner.

45:05.458 --> 45:07.458
What are you two doing blocking the door?

45:20.708 --> 45:21.458
I don't think he smelled anything.

45:21.458 --> 45:23.208
If I can't, there's no way he could have.

45:23.458 --> 45:25.458
unless he's got the sense of a dog.

45:25.500 --> 45:27.458
I have a bad feeling about this.

45:35.792 --> 45:37.708
Fire!

45:46.958 --> 45:47.750
40 seconds.

45:48.458 --> 45:50.333
Line up.

45:50.417 --> 45:52.042
It's been a minute and there are still people missing.

45:52.458 --> 45:54.417
Safety awareness is low.

45:56.458 --> 45:57.583
Madame,

45:58.125 --> 46:00.500
it's a fire, can you move quicker?

46:06.417 --> 46:08.458
How can you tell that's your staff?

46:12.417 --> 46:13.167
The mask,

46:13.250 --> 46:14.042
take it off.

46:14.750 --> 46:15.500
Hurry up.

46:16.208 --> 46:17.542
It's you, come on.

46:20.458 --> 46:21.375
What's wrong with her?

46:28.458 --> 46:30.833
A single layer cannot protect you from smoke;

46:31.000 --> 46:32.250
take away your towel.

46:35.458 --> 46:37.000
Put your hands down.

46:37.458 --> 46:38.458
Hands down!

46:38.458 --> 46:40.250
Come on, take it off.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.208
There's more than one layer.

46:44.917 --> 46:45.917
Two layers.

46:49.375 --> 46:50.500
Three layers.

46:52.375 --> 46:53.542
Keep going.

46:57.750 --> 46:58.750
- Alright.
- Stop!

47:35.458 --> 47:37.417
I have to bake a cake?

47:38.750 --> 47:40.750
He must know it's me.

48:22.417 --> 48:24.208
Only you

48:24.375 --> 48:25.458
could be fooled by the same trick twice.

48:30.458 --> 48:32.458
You vandalized my car to get close to me?

48:35.042 --> 48:37.792
So every time we met was a coincidence?

48:42.458 --> 48:44.458
When did you find out who I am?

48:45.917 --> 48:47.708
When you were being interviewed.

48:48.458 --> 48:49.708
When did you find out who I am?

48:49.792 --> 48:51.208
Did I say it was your turn?

48:53.833 --> 48:55.458
Why didn't you say anything?

48:59.417 --> 49:02.000
It's not important to me who you are.

49:03.333 --> 49:04.833
Then why did you use truffle to snipe at me?

49:06.500 --> 49:08.333
You're quite similar to truffle.

49:08.417 --> 49:10.500
They have to kill all vegetation around them

49:10.583 --> 49:12.000
for them to grow.

49:14.375 --> 49:15.500
So nasty.

49:17.458 --> 49:19.708
Then why make the "Once in a lifetime" dish?

49:20.542 --> 49:22.458
They're just contradictory.

49:25.708 --> 49:27.042
I'm not the only one.

49:27.958 --> 49:30.458
Why bother to look for me if I annoy you?

49:35.958 --> 49:37.542
Just hurry up and bake my cake.

50:02.333 --> 50:02.875
Hello?

50:03.375 --> 50:06.167
You should be in Switzerland,
why are you still in Shanghai?

50:06.458 --> 50:07.458
I'm nearly done.

50:08.125 --> 50:10.125
We're finalizing the cost.

50:10.458 --> 50:11.458
It's just a hotel.

50:11.542 --> 50:13.583
You shouldn't waste any more time on it.

50:13.708 --> 50:14.500
I know.

50:15.208 --> 50:16.042
Hurry up.

50:17.167 --> 50:18.458
Yes, father.

50:35.542 --> 50:38.542
Hotel Information.

50:38.625 --> 50:42.458
The hotel does not meet standards.

50:56.500 --> 50:57.833
Ask your general manager to come up.

50:58.792 --> 50:59.625
I want room service.

50:59.958 --> 51:02.750
Mr. Lu, the chef you want is off today.

51:02.833 --> 51:03.542
Would you like to try--

51:07.792 --> 51:09.458
1123 is looking for me?

51:11.458 --> 51:12.750
He didn't order anything?

51:15.250 --> 51:16.458
Alright, bye.

51:21.458 --> 51:22.250
Who is it?

51:25.500 --> 51:27.917
What is the Lobster Three Way?

51:28.333 --> 51:30.458
Fried the head, sashimi the body,
use the tail for congee.

51:30.625 --> 51:32.042
306!

51:32.458 --> 51:34.417
306! 306!

51:42.458 --> 51:45.458
The man said if I find the person
who knows the answer,

51:45.458 --> 51:47.542
he'll give me the lobster.

52:31.958 --> 52:34.333
The staff at the hotel said you took a sick leave.

52:34.958 --> 52:36.458
My dog is sick.

52:36.458 --> 52:37.250
What is it?

52:38.458 --> 52:39.542
Just visiting...

52:42.125 --> 52:43.250
for dinner.

53:23.542 --> 53:24.458
Where's the table?

53:24.500 --> 53:25.917
Right in front of you.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.458
It's perfect for watching TV while eating.

53:27.458 --> 53:28.625
Don't you think it's convenient?

53:40.333 --> 53:41.042
Hurry up.

53:41.167 --> 53:43.000
I won't be able to guarantee the safety of the dog.

53:43.125 --> 53:43.625
Don't.

53:47.167 --> 53:48.458
Is it ready yet?

53:57.458 --> 53:59.208
Boss, dinner time.

54:03.042 --> 54:03.750
Sorry.

54:03.833 --> 54:05.375
My dog's name is Boss.

54:13.208 --> 54:16.375
Was there something wrong with the table?

54:16.542 --> 54:19.833
The dinning table is the most
basic component to a meal.

54:19.958 --> 54:22.125
Having the table like this is kind of artsy.

54:23.500 --> 54:26.000
I have one rule when eating...

54:31.458 --> 54:33.917
Why can't you eat with someone?

54:37.625 --> 54:39.750
Eating is very personal.

54:40.458 --> 54:41.917
How can I do that with someone else?

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Do you take shower with others?

54:45.458 --> 54:47.042
How are they the same thing?

54:47.167 --> 54:48.042
I don't believe you.

54:48.167 --> 54:49.583
What about family and friends?

54:49.708 --> 54:51.333
You must have gatherings?

54:52.458 --> 54:53.458
The lower a creature is on the food chain,

54:53.500 --> 54:55.625
the more they like to eat together.

54:56.708 --> 54:58.042
Look at ants,

54:58.458 --> 54:59.208
flies,

54:59.333 --> 55:00.625
condors, dogs.

55:01.417 --> 55:02.458
If you look at hawks,

55:02.542 --> 55:05.042
they eat alone.

55:07.542 --> 55:09.417
Animals are different.

55:09.583 --> 55:10.625
They are.

55:11.458 --> 55:13.500
They don't nag as much.

55:19.375 --> 55:20.417
The curtains,

55:20.792 --> 55:22.333
they are not light proof.

55:22.625 --> 55:23.458
I don't need curtains;

55:23.458 --> 55:24.458
they're not important.

55:24.458 --> 55:26.458
I love watching the sun;

55:26.917 --> 55:28.458
and it's a shame that I am at my busiest

55:28.458 --> 55:30.125
when the sun sets.

55:30.458 --> 55:32.625
I don't get much of a chance to see it.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.125
Do you want seconds?

55:38.625 --> 55:39.833
If you don't,

55:39.958 --> 55:41.625
I'll let Boss have it.

57:26.708 --> 57:28.917
According to the ranking
of the most erotic meals, the hotpot

57:29.000 --> 57:29.958
is first on the list

57:30.125 --> 57:32.250
because a certain act of intimacy between lovers

57:32.375 --> 57:33.750
is very similar.

57:34.583 --> 57:37.208
The constant exchange of saliva,

57:37.417 --> 57:39.167
the blushing,

57:39.458 --> 57:40.458
the increase of heart rate.

57:40.458 --> 57:41.542
Dry mouth

57:41.625 --> 57:42.917
drunk without alcohol.

57:43.458 --> 57:44.792
If it's good,

57:44.917 --> 57:45.917
once is enough.

57:46.208 --> 57:47.458
My boss is a foodie.

57:47.500 --> 57:49.375
Your BFF is a chef.

57:49.708 --> 57:51.042
If they are happy,

57:51.167 --> 57:53.375
then we can continue to see each other.

58:02.458 --> 58:03.250
Who is it?

58:05.000 --> 58:06.458
Why are you here again?

58:06.458 --> 58:07.458
Dinner.

58:13.458 --> 58:14.958
I thought you said dinner?

58:16.375 --> 58:17.375
A nap too.

58:39.417 --> 58:41.125
He's invading our territory,

58:41.208 --> 58:42.458
should we kick him out?

58:43.458 --> 58:45.417
Go.

59:04.333 --> 59:06.208
I can't sleep properly with you here every night.

59:06.333 --> 59:08.333
It's affecting my work.

59:14.917 --> 59:15.917
Lights out.

59:19.958 --> 59:21.583
He eats my food during the day,

59:21.958 --> 59:23.125
sleeps at my place at night,

59:23.208 --> 59:24.708
taking up all my time on the weekends!

59:25.167 --> 59:26.167
I'm burnt out.

59:26.792 --> 59:28.625
If you take advantage of him,

59:28.750 --> 59:30.417
then you'd make it even.

59:30.500 --> 59:31.458
How?

59:32.167 --> 59:33.208
Let me show you.

59:37.458 --> 59:38.792
No, it's OK, I know what to do.

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:24.250
Sit.

01:01:24.708 --> 01:01:27.458
I told you I don't eat with other people.

01:01:27.542 --> 01:01:29.042
Sometimes, I don't see myself as a person

01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:29.792
depending on how I feel.

01:01:29.917 --> 01:01:31.042
It's your choice.

01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:56.417
I have always wanted to ask you something.

01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:59.792
How much money do you have?

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.500
35 billion

01:02:07.333 --> 01:02:08.167
US dollars.

01:02:10.458 --> 01:02:12.208
Forbes magazine said last year.

01:02:13.458 --> 01:02:14.917
Then you don't need to work.

01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:17.125
You can do whatever you want.

01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:18.458
You think?

01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:21.042
What would you do if you were rich?

01:02:21.542 --> 01:02:22.417
Spend it.

01:02:24.417 --> 01:02:27.417
35 billion US dollars.

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:29.125
Do you know how much that really is?

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:30.708
It's impossible to spend it all.

01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:33.000
What if,

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:36.542
you give me the task to spend it all.

01:02:40.042 --> 01:02:42.375
If you can earn 35 billion,

01:02:43.625 --> 01:02:45.583
that means you have hundreds of thousands of staff.

01:02:45.958 --> 01:02:47.458
Your problem

01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:51.458
will be figuring out how to earn another 35 billion.

01:02:55.458 --> 01:02:56.042
Here,

01:02:56.417 --> 01:02:57.458
have more.

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:05.208
Blowfish?

01:03:05.583 --> 01:03:07.333
Don't they call you Mr. Blowfish?

01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:12.250
Boss,

01:03:12.417 --> 01:03:14.042
this is high in cholesterol;

01:03:14.167 --> 01:03:15.208
it's not good for an old dog like you.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.500
Go munch on your dog food.

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:19.167
Boss is very old.

01:03:19.792 --> 01:03:22.375
The doctor said he doesn't have much time left.

01:03:23.417 --> 01:03:25.458
I'm scared of that day,

01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:28.458
but I want to be with him till the end.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:32.458
For him to have met you,

01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:34.458
he is very lucky.

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:36.583
Unlike my dog.

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:40.250
You've had one, too?

01:03:42.458 --> 01:03:43.792
When I was little.

01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:47.417
But I don't know why

01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:49.500
it vanished one day.

01:03:50.458 --> 01:03:52.125
Couldn't find him anywhere.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.458
Not long after that, we moved.

01:03:59.167 --> 01:04:01.708
You must have been quite upset?

01:04:08.125 --> 01:04:09.458
I didn't feel much.

01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:12.417
No one in this world

01:04:12.458 --> 01:04:14.375
will really be with you until the end.

01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:16.792
I don't need it anyway.

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:24.125
I've noticed

01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:25.625
me dining with you

01:04:26.167 --> 01:04:27.458
makes you talk a lot.

01:04:45.167 --> 01:04:47.833
Stupid humans.

01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:49.750
Gluttony.

01:04:50.917 --> 01:04:53.417
Something is wrong with your blowfish.

01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:54.458
You must be joking.

01:04:54.542 --> 01:04:57.750
This was given to me by a rich friend.

01:04:57.833 --> 01:04:59.833
A fellow businessman bought this.

01:05:01.833 --> 01:05:03.417
We should be fine.

01:05:05.833 --> 01:05:07.125
We will be fine.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:24.042
Stupid humans.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.375
Your flat is leaking.

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:39.167
Do you have an umbrella?

01:05:40.958 --> 01:05:41.542
Wow.

01:05:42.167 --> 01:05:43.458
It's raining.

01:05:43.458 --> 01:05:44.125
Damn it.

01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:52.333
Let's go outside to get away from the rain.

01:05:55.542 --> 01:05:57.000
I didn't realize rain

01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:58.458
could bring so much fun and joy.

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:02.458
I never felt it before.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:03.583
Quite good.

01:06:06.917 --> 01:06:09.333
But isn't the rain kind of light?

01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:10.208
Heavier.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:11.500
Heavier!

01:06:17.458 --> 01:06:18.333
Lighter!

01:06:25.792 --> 01:06:27.250
Heavier!

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:28.458
Heavier!

01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:29.458
Lighter!

01:06:29.458 --> 01:06:30.458
Heavier!

01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:32.042
Heavier!

01:06:32.167 --> 01:06:32.833
Lighter!

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:35.000
Heavier!

01:06:37.458 --> 01:06:38.083
Heavier!

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:40.542
Lighter!

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:41.792
Heavier!

01:06:43.167 --> 01:06:44.208
Lighter!

01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:46.333
Heavier!

01:06:48.458 --> 01:06:49.208
Heavier!

01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:08.458
Why don't they have umbrellas?

01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:47.583
Put down the umbrella.

01:07:49.042 --> 01:07:50.458
No, the rain is so heavy.

01:07:50.458 --> 01:07:51.958
You'll get wet.

01:07:57.458 --> 01:08:00.375
Your hands are cold
and you don't want the umbrella?

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:05.167
But that's OK.

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:07.458
I'll make you boiled Coke with ginger.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:08.958
I promise you'll be fine.

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:10.792
I won't let you get sick.

01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:20.957
Come closer,

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:23.125
it'll be bad if you get sick.

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:26.207
You come closer, too.

01:08:26.332 --> 01:08:28.457
It'll be worse if you get sick.

01:08:38.917 --> 01:08:41.457
Look, none of them

01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:44.332
have umbrellas.

01:08:44.417 --> 01:08:45.500
Only we have one.

01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:47.792
They must be jealous of us.

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:50.457
Yeah.

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:52.500
Let's keep it down low.

01:08:52.582 --> 01:08:53.417
Voices too.

01:08:53.457 --> 01:08:54.957
Down low.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.167
Your hair is wet.

01:09:02.457 --> 01:09:04.457
Let me dry it for you.

01:09:09.457 --> 01:09:10.750
You'll get wet like that.

01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:13.250
This is an ionic dryer,

01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:14.542
it won't damage your hair.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.207
Your moustache too.

01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:39.957
Thank you.

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:15.333
Haven't you eaten already?

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:23.167
Wait.

01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:28.000
Good morning, everyone.

01:10:28.125 --> 01:10:33.500
Rosebud will bring its vast experience and its vision

01:10:34.042 --> 01:10:35.500
to the VN Group, through this cooperation.

01:10:40.458 --> 01:10:44.583
It is our goal to bring innovation

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:46.625
and success to the VN group.

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:50.333
I believe that there are many
positive changes that we can make

01:10:50.417 --> 01:10:54.708
including hiring new employees
with international experience

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:58.250
and a 3-star Michelin chef.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.458
Thank you all for being here today

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:04.708
and wishing us a very bright future together.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:19.167
Hey, Zhaodi.

01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:22.750
Have you been in touch with Meng recently?

01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:27.125
He and his boss haven't been back
to the hotel for two nights.

01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:32.792
Who is it?

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:35.458
You came.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.458
Open the gate.

01:11:41.958 --> 01:11:43.208
Don't you two live at the hotel?

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:45.125
My boss has them all over the world.

01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:47.125
We only stayed for work.

01:11:47.208 --> 01:11:48.125
Where is he?

01:11:48.458 --> 01:11:49.583
He's inside work...

01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:52.542
working

01:11:55.125 --> 01:11:56.042
I smell food.

01:11:56.167 --> 01:11:57.417
Hey!

01:11:57.583 --> 01:11:58.458
You can't go inside!

01:11:58.458 --> 01:11:59.458
- Hey!
- Run!

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:21.958
Why didn't you tell me you have another place to eat?

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:35.250
I didn't know you had a guest.

01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:37.250
Please wait in the living room.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:39.458
Excuse me?

01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:40.458
She is?

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:42.208
Me?

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:43.542
You are?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:47.958
My...

01:12:48.042 --> 01:12:49.333
chef.

01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:51.583
My chef.

01:12:56.167 --> 01:12:58.458
You found a new chef?

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:00.208
Not new.

01:13:01.042 --> 01:13:02.958
She's my personal chef.

01:13:03.708 --> 01:13:05.250
She just came back from vacation.

01:13:06.458 --> 01:13:08.000
I've been his chef for 7 years.

01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:09.208
Why didn't you tell me

01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:11.250
she's a female chef, too?

01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:14.458
You didn't ask.

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:18.917
Why didn't you tell me you already have a chef?

01:13:19.375 --> 01:13:20.792
You didn't ask either.

01:13:25.208 --> 01:13:25.750
It's alright.

01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:27.458
Since you're a guest here,

01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:29.042
please wait in the living room.

01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:30.208
Let me prepare something

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:31.208
for you to try.

01:13:31.333 --> 01:13:32.333
No.

01:13:32.417 --> 01:13:33.417
I'm not interested.

01:13:33.833 --> 01:13:35.417
Since Mr. Lu's tastes have changed,

01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:36.792
I won't be sticking around.

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:52.458
Why is she making Spaghetti alla Strega?

01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:54.333
This...

01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:55.750
is just a dish.

01:13:56.583 --> 01:13:58.458
It's just a dish, huh?

01:14:00.042 --> 01:14:00.625
It...

01:14:01.167 --> 01:14:03.208
isn't... just a dish...

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:04.708
huh?

01:14:10.167 --> 01:14:12.250
Even if it's just a dish,

01:14:13.458 --> 01:14:15.250
it is my dish

01:14:19.125 --> 01:14:20.125
I can see that.

01:14:20.208 --> 01:14:21.458
But you made it for Mr. Lu

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:22.458
so it's his now.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.417
And if he likes a dish, it also becomes mine.

01:14:24.458 --> 01:14:26.917
After all, I am his personal chef.

01:14:37.042 --> 01:14:37.833
They've slept together?

01:14:37.958 --> 01:14:39.333
It's not about that.

01:14:39.417 --> 01:14:40.708
For 7 years,

01:14:40.792 --> 01:14:42.208
he has eaten food prepared by this woman.

01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:44.458
What's wrong with that?

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.458
I've eaten my dad's cooking

01:14:45.458 --> 01:14:47.167
for 24 years.

01:14:49.333 --> 01:14:51.458
Eating is a very intimate matter.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.458
You wouldn't understand!

01:15:03.167 --> 01:15:05.333
Miss Gu, you look so young.

01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:07.208
How long have you been a chef?

01:15:08.458 --> 01:15:09.167
5 years.

01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:11.333
5 years?

01:15:11.917 --> 01:15:14.458
Then you're just a novice.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.167
Your youthfulness is not of any use to Mr. Lu.

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:19.750
Only experienced hands can master his tastes.

01:15:20.167 --> 01:15:21.625
Tastes change.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.625
Eating food by the same person for 7 years,

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:25.833
doesn't it become boring?

01:15:26.458 --> 01:15:28.458
Maybe it will.

01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:29.958
That's why I understand

01:15:30.042 --> 01:15:31.500
his desire to try something different.

01:15:31.583 --> 01:15:34.042
Don't talk as if he's yours.

01:15:34.458 --> 01:15:36.375
The point is I am his.

01:15:36.458 --> 01:15:38.000
When I was your age,

01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:39.792
I already knew that

01:15:39.917 --> 01:15:41.833
solely cooking for him is a privilege.

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:44.458
Cooking is not about one person impressing another;

01:15:44.542 --> 01:15:46.167
it is an exchange.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.542
That sounds nice,

01:15:47.625 --> 01:15:48.792
but there are plenty of chefs in this world

01:15:48.917 --> 01:15:50.750
just like you.

01:15:50.833 --> 01:15:53.167
Mr. Lu has tried the most wonderful dishes

01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:54.542
by the greatest chefs in the world in passing.

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:56.708
In the end, he always come back to me and

01:15:56.792 --> 01:15:57.833
eats what I've prepared.

01:15:57.958 --> 01:15:58.625
You're right.

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:00.458
Tastes change;

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:02.042
but habits don't.

01:16:02.167 --> 01:16:05.625
My dishes give him a feeling of home.

01:16:08.458 --> 01:16:09.167
Alright,

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.417
we've talked enough about food.

01:16:11.458 --> 01:16:12.750
Let's talk business.

01:16:13.625 --> 01:16:15.958
Mr. Lu has pushed back too much of his schedule.

01:16:16.042 --> 01:16:20.250
He should be in Switzerland
buying out three hotel groups

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.500
that own 150 hotels

01:16:21.583 --> 01:16:24.833
in 34 countries, across 5 continents.

01:16:24.958 --> 01:16:26.458
Which means,

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:28.750
everyday he stays in Shanghai,

01:16:28.833 --> 01:16:31.458
he'll lose at least another

01:16:31.458 --> 01:16:32.833
1 million US dollars.

01:16:33.583 --> 01:16:35.458
That is his own choice.

01:16:35.542 --> 01:16:37.458
I'm here to give you one too.

01:16:37.542 --> 01:16:38.958
You and I

01:16:39.042 --> 01:16:40.458
cook for him together.

01:16:41.458 --> 01:16:44.375
How can you accept both of us cooking for him?

01:16:44.458 --> 01:16:45.750
I can't.

01:16:46.167 --> 01:16:47.000
But

01:16:47.125 --> 01:16:48.917
it's a compromise I must make.

01:16:53.458 --> 01:16:55.333
Mr. Lu's schedule is in there.

01:16:55.417 --> 01:16:57.458
Apart from the dates he's away,

01:16:57.792 --> 01:16:59.208
Mondays through Fridays

01:16:59.333 --> 01:16:59.917
I'll cook.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.042
Weekends,

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:02.375
he's yours.

01:17:02.458 --> 01:17:03.458
Impossible.

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:06.458
You should sleep on it.

01:17:06.958 --> 01:17:08.500
It's the best option you've got.

01:17:13.917 --> 01:17:14.792
Oh,

01:17:15.125 --> 01:17:16.458
read the footnote.

01:17:16.542 --> 01:17:18.458
I'll make breakfast on the weekends

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.625
because he likes the way I do

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.125
eggs sunny-side-up.

01:17:28.458 --> 01:17:34.458
Chop...

01:18:26.167 --> 01:18:26.875
How long till you're ready?

01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:27.500
2 minutes.

01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:29.125
Hurry up, we're behind.

01:18:32.042 --> 01:18:33.458
Everyone stop.

01:18:34.375 --> 01:18:35.708
The lunch is cancelled;

01:18:36.792 --> 01:18:38.583
we've been fired.

01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:40.792
What?

01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:42.625
It was just announced.

01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.708
I need to speak with you.

01:19:03.167 --> 01:19:04.917
I know you're still angry

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.250
about my personal chef.

01:19:07.625 --> 01:19:10.917
I'm not interested in that at all;

01:19:12.583 --> 01:19:14.458
I only want to know

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.792
are you going to fire all of us?

01:19:20.458 --> 01:19:21.458
Why?

01:19:21.792 --> 01:19:23.458
The future of this place

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:26.167
is to become an international standard boutique hotel.

01:19:28.458 --> 01:19:30.458
What's international standard?

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:32.125
You feel

01:19:32.458 --> 01:19:34.750
we're not international enough?

01:19:34.833 --> 01:19:36.750
Or not boutique enough?

01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:39.458
It's not up to standard.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.625
Then why didn't you tell us earlier?

01:19:42.417 --> 01:19:44.333
Does it make a difference?

01:19:44.792 --> 01:19:48.375
Would I not slaughter a pig if I told it?

01:19:51.625 --> 01:19:53.458
Are we the pigs?

01:19:54.458 --> 01:19:55.917
It's a metaphor.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:57.958
There are only 3 types of people in this world:

01:19:58.042 --> 01:20:00.167
the butchers, the customers,

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:01.250
and the pigs.

01:20:01.542 --> 01:20:04.042
Have you considered our feelings?

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:06.000
Pigs have feelings too.

01:20:06.125 --> 01:20:07.542
Whichever type you are,

01:20:07.625 --> 01:20:09.750
you must have feelings too.

01:20:10.458 --> 01:20:11.917
Pigs have feelings too!

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:14.583
The first time I fired someone, I was 19.

01:20:14.708 --> 01:20:16.458
That person worked for us for 20 years

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.458
with 2 kids.

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:18.833
It doesn't make any difference!

01:20:19.375 --> 01:20:21.833
People can't be controlled by these things.

01:20:21.958 --> 01:20:22.917
This is a job.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.375
You have yours; I have mine.

01:20:25.458 --> 01:20:27.583
Firing people is my job today.

01:20:28.625 --> 01:20:32.125
Then I'm just part of your job, right?

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:38.583
Can you try to think outside of yourself?

01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:41.333
Look at this from a different angle?

01:20:42.375 --> 01:20:44.500
Use my way of thinking, not yours.

01:20:45.792 --> 01:20:48.250
I'm just an ordinary person.

01:20:48.833 --> 01:20:51.500
I don't know how to reach your standard.

01:20:51.583 --> 01:20:54.625
Plus, I can't accept the fact
that you had two personal chefs.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:57.583
How could you eat both our dishes?

01:20:57.708 --> 01:20:58.458
Tell me!

01:20:58.458 --> 01:21:00.458
She's a well qualified chef.

01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:01.375
Qualified my ass.

01:21:01.458 --> 01:21:03.458
Just because I met a new chef,

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:04.208
doesn't mean I can fire her.

01:21:04.333 --> 01:21:06.208
I'm not a new chef.

01:21:06.833 --> 01:21:08.583
You can't like both our dishes.

01:21:08.708 --> 01:21:10.708
You have to pick one.

01:21:11.208 --> 01:21:12.125
Why?

01:21:12.208 --> 01:21:13.417
Why ask why?

01:21:13.458 --> 01:21:14.958
There's no why!

01:21:35.375 --> 01:21:37.500
You're not just a chef.

01:21:41.833 --> 01:21:43.417
You're special.

01:21:44.458 --> 01:21:47.750
But sometimes too special and

01:21:49.042 --> 01:21:51.458
that's beyond any standard.

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.417
So special that you can't be controlled.

01:21:55.167 --> 01:21:57.458
So special that I don't know what to do with you.

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.167
That's why I stayed to figure out what it is.

01:22:06.375 --> 01:22:08.833
Boss, figure out what?

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:11.250
Tell me.

01:22:13.375 --> 01:22:15.833
Because right now, I don't have...

01:22:17.625 --> 01:22:21.042
Right now, I don't have a suitable position for you.

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:24.208
There's nothing to figure out.

01:22:24.333 --> 01:22:26.000
Nothing.
I wanted to quit some time ago.

01:22:26.125 --> 01:22:27.375
I don't want to be anywhere near you

01:22:27.458 --> 01:22:30.333
because you have no emotions at all!

01:22:32.458 --> 01:22:33.167
You

01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:34.167
are not a human being!

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:35.500
Pig!

01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:02.333
Is this yours?

01:25:06.042 --> 01:25:08.500
It's our last day, let's give our all.

01:25:09.625 --> 01:25:12.250
Alright, an order from 1123.

01:25:17.167 --> 01:25:19.125
I heard it's a new guest.

01:25:25.458 --> 01:25:27.208
Rosebud will have a press conference

01:25:27.333 --> 01:25:28.458
to announce the buyout.

01:25:28.542 --> 01:25:30.375
They hope you can be there.

01:25:31.583 --> 01:25:33.208
It's just a hotel;

01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:35.375
I've wasted enough time.

01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:42.750
Zhaodi, I'm leaving for the UK.

01:25:42.833 --> 01:25:44.542
I'm going to quit and move to Shanghai.

01:25:44.583 --> 01:25:45.458
Give me a couple of months.

01:25:45.458 --> 01:25:46.167
No,

01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:47.208
make it one.

01:25:50.708 --> 01:25:51.625
I...

01:25:53.458 --> 01:25:57.500
think I am regretting how harsh I was on him.

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:05.458
You said you'd stop thinking about it.

01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:09.000
I...

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:13.042
I felt strange.

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:15.042
I wanted to tell him.

01:26:16.458 --> 01:26:18.750
I couldn't control myself.

01:26:18.833 --> 01:26:21.417
I didn't know why those words came out.

01:26:21.458 --> 01:26:22.458
But,

01:26:23.458 --> 01:26:24.625
I really...

01:26:25.458 --> 01:26:27.792
really want to tell him something clichÃ©.

01:26:27.917 --> 01:26:30.458
I like him a lot.

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:37.250
I don't know why.

01:26:37.375 --> 01:26:39.042
I can't help

01:26:39.167 --> 01:26:41.167
but to think of him.

01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:43.583
I'm constantly thinking about him.

01:26:58.458 --> 01:27:00.958
He is someone I despise,

01:27:01.042 --> 01:27:02.458
yet I can't figure out why

01:27:02.458 --> 01:27:04.792
I'm so upset over this.

01:27:30.542 --> 01:27:32.250
Does it not suit your appetite?

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:35.917
No.

01:27:37.417 --> 01:27:39.750
You want to join me?

01:27:47.375 --> 01:27:49.250
I'm afraid I can't.

01:27:49.542 --> 01:27:51.417
Over the years,

01:27:51.625 --> 01:27:55.583
I only ever cook one portion for you...

01:27:56.208 --> 01:27:59.458
for every single meal.

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:08.458
Bon apetit.

01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:45.708
What you want is no longer just food.

01:28:45.792 --> 01:28:47.792
I'm no longer needed here.

01:28:58.458 --> 01:28:59.917
Just the person I wanted to see.

01:29:01.125 --> 01:29:03.458
What happened in Shanghai?

01:29:04.625 --> 01:29:06.458
I told you many times;

01:29:07.125 --> 01:29:08.458
you can't make it personal.

01:29:08.708 --> 01:29:11.417
Personal makes it beyond your control.

01:29:13.333 --> 01:29:14.000
I know.

01:29:14.125 --> 01:29:15.708
What about their food and drinks?

01:29:15.792 --> 01:29:18.417
They are collaborating with Michelin restaurants.

01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:20.750
The food can't be too good.

01:29:20.833 --> 01:29:21.750
It can't distract our clients

01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:23.958
while we talk business.

01:29:26.042 --> 01:29:27.208
Anything else?

01:29:28.042 --> 01:29:29.167
Father,

01:29:30.417 --> 01:29:33.125
it's been a long time since we ate together.

01:29:33.958 --> 01:29:36.458
Let's sit down for breakfast.

01:29:48.542 --> 01:29:50.458
While I was away,

01:29:50.542 --> 01:29:52.042
did you get any better?

01:29:53.417 --> 01:29:55.917
The media likes to collect dumbasses.

01:29:56.375 --> 01:29:58.208
Placing them together for all to see.

01:29:58.333 --> 01:29:59.750
Didn't I tell you

01:30:00.375 --> 01:30:02.167
to screen them before accepting interviews?

01:30:02.958 --> 01:30:05.042
Look, you've become a joke.

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:06.125
Right?

01:30:06.208 --> 01:30:08.583
Do we have to talk about this while eating?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.833
Who allowed you to waste so much time on food?

01:30:14.333 --> 01:30:16.708
Hunger is the simplest of instincts.

01:30:17.458 --> 01:30:18.458
If you're controlled by it,

01:30:19.458 --> 01:30:20.958
you're weak in the mind.

01:30:27.167 --> 01:30:30.458
I finally get why people despise me.

01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:32.208
What's wrong with that?

01:30:33.208 --> 01:30:35.458
Being despised allows solitude,
solitude gives you a clear mind.

01:30:35.542 --> 01:30:37.583
With a clear mind, you won't be influenced.

01:30:37.917 --> 01:30:40.458
You see how we can easily control
the financial landscape?

01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:44.542
We are not just anyone.

01:30:44.833 --> 01:30:46.750
I put a lot of effort into

01:30:47.958 --> 01:30:50.917
molding you into a despicable person.

01:30:51.542 --> 01:30:52.958
You should be thankful.

01:30:53.458 --> 01:30:54.792
What about love?

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:58.167
Haven't you ever loved anyone?

01:30:58.458 --> 01:30:59.583
Of course.

01:31:01.583 --> 01:31:02.625
You.

01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:06.208
Even though you have many flaws,

01:31:06.792 --> 01:31:08.375
you're still my son.

01:31:09.042 --> 01:31:10.458
I have to love you.

01:31:25.333 --> 01:31:26.333
I'm full.

01:31:34.042 --> 01:31:36.458
I have always wanted to ask,

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:39.917
the dog I had when I was little,

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:42.917
was thrown out by you, right?

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.917
What dog?

01:31:52.458 --> 01:31:53.458
Father.

01:31:54.458 --> 01:31:55.542
You're so pitiful.

01:32:01.958 --> 01:32:03.458
What's our next stop?

01:32:03.458 --> 01:32:05.750
London to New York, an 8 hour flight.

01:32:06.542 --> 01:32:07.708
Let's make a stop in Shanghai.

01:32:07.792 --> 01:32:09.167
Stopover in Shanghai?

01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:11.000
That would take 18 hours extra, also--

01:32:11.125 --> 01:32:12.792
Do we have an issue? Get it done!

01:32:17.708 --> 01:32:19.833
Without a job, I have no money.

01:32:20.458 --> 01:32:22.833
Without money, there's no life.

01:32:22.958 --> 01:32:24.542
So, Boss,

01:32:24.625 --> 01:32:26.542
we have to work together and

01:32:26.625 --> 01:32:28.542
watch our expenses.

01:32:31.458 --> 01:32:33.708
Trade it in, get it over with.

01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:36.375
How much can I get for this?

01:32:36.458 --> 01:32:37.458
Is it a fake?

01:32:37.458 --> 01:32:39.333
Never mind, I don't want to sell it.

01:32:42.125 --> 01:32:43.625
Are you selling it or not?

01:33:19.042 --> 01:33:20.542
Run, Boss!

01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:28.500
Come on, drive!

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:07.458
Stop here.

01:34:07.625 --> 01:34:08.500
That's all I've got,

01:34:09.042 --> 01:34:09.583
sorry.

01:34:52.542 --> 01:34:53.833
Gu Shengnan!

01:35:06.833 --> 01:35:08.125
Gu Shengnan!

01:35:08.792 --> 01:35:10.042
Come out right now!

01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:13.167
It's useless to hide!

01:35:52.833 --> 01:35:53.958
Where is she?

01:35:58.458 --> 01:36:00.375
Do you want me to bring you a late-night snack again?

01:36:33.458 --> 01:36:34.250
Come out!

01:36:34.458 --> 01:36:35.583
I want to talk.

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.208
I have nothing to say!

01:36:39.958 --> 01:36:40.917
Traitor.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.333
Why did you run away?

01:36:42.417 --> 01:36:43.750
Because I hate you.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:45.500
What for?

01:36:45.583 --> 01:36:46.833
Everything about you.

01:36:48.375 --> 01:36:51.458
Then you hate me more than I hate you.

01:36:52.125 --> 01:36:54.375
I just hate that you are not so bright and

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:55.750
speak without logic.

01:36:55.833 --> 01:36:57.458
You do things without planning.

01:36:57.750 --> 01:37:00.375
You're silly when you're sober,
worse when you're drunk.

01:37:00.458 --> 01:37:01.542
Your home is like a pigsty.

01:37:01.625 --> 01:37:02.458
Shut up!

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:03.458
Come out and I'll shut up!

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:04.500
I'm not going to fall for that.

01:37:04.583 --> 01:37:05.750
I won't cook for you ever again

01:37:05.833 --> 01:37:07.458
regardless of what job you give me.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.583
I don't have a job for you;

01:37:12.458 --> 01:37:14.458
but there is a place for you by my side.

01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:23.625
I always thought I liked to eat by myself.

01:37:24.583 --> 01:37:26.333
Since I met you,

01:37:27.458 --> 01:37:29.375
I realized

01:37:29.458 --> 01:37:31.792
no one wanted to eat with me.

01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:40.833
You...

01:37:41.583 --> 01:37:43.458
Didn't you say you hate me?

01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:45.500
Remember you said I was special?

01:37:46.458 --> 01:37:47.458
I know

01:37:47.583 --> 01:37:49.458
you just enjoyed what I cooked for you.

01:37:49.625 --> 01:37:51.458
I enjoy food cooked by many different people;

01:37:51.958 --> 01:37:54.625
but I never said any of those things to them.

01:37:57.042 --> 01:37:59.417
What if I didn't know how to cook?

01:37:59.458 --> 01:38:00.458
Would you still like me?

01:38:00.625 --> 01:38:01.958
I don't know!

01:38:04.458 --> 01:38:05.750
I cannot imagine

01:38:05.833 --> 01:38:08.750
if I'd like a you that can't cook.

01:38:09.792 --> 01:38:11.167
Just like I can't imagine

01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:14.167
if I would like a you who didn't make mistakes.

01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:15.917
Because I can't just choose

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.208
to like your strengths but not your flaws.

01:38:19.417 --> 01:38:21.458
Do you understand, Gu Shengnan?

01:38:22.333 --> 01:38:26.250
I can't choose to like you or not.

01:38:29.208 --> 01:38:31.583
Then you're saying you like me?

01:38:31.708 --> 01:38:33.458
You're a pig!

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:35.375
Open the door!

01:38:38.125 --> 01:38:38.833
Open it!

01:38:39.417 --> 01:38:41.000
Am I sexy?

01:38:41.417 --> 01:38:42.208
What?

01:38:42.458 --> 01:38:45.458
Am I the sexiest person alive?

01:38:46.375 --> 01:38:48.417
You are the...

01:38:49.167 --> 01:38:51.625
most ordinarily sexy person alive.

01:38:54.458 --> 01:38:55.458
Open the door!

01:39:18.167 --> 01:39:19.500
You should called the police.

01:39:19.958 --> 01:39:21.458
No, call the directory

01:39:21.458 --> 01:39:24.458
to find a locksmith.

01:39:26.417 --> 01:39:27.792
This door!

01:39:31.958 --> 01:39:33.750
Just because you saved me

01:39:33.833 --> 01:39:35.458
doesn't mean I'll let you into my place.

01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:44.833
This isn't my place.

01:39:45.167 --> 01:39:46.458
It's over there.

01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:08.958
Where are we?

01:40:30.833 --> 01:40:34.417
You can get the best sunset view from here.

01:40:52.792 --> 01:40:53.917
Concentrate.

01:40:57.458 --> 01:41:00.250
You'll miss it, if you don't concentrate.

01:41:04.042 --> 01:41:05.750
What did you say to them?

01:41:06.167 --> 01:41:08.792
I said, "May I borrow your place
to look at the sunset?"

01:41:08.917 --> 01:41:10.458
"I'll give you anything you want."

01:41:10.458 --> 01:41:12.458
Just to look at the sunset?

01:41:13.458 --> 01:41:14.417
Yes.

01:41:18.917 --> 01:41:20.208
What are you doing?

01:41:23.458 --> 01:41:25.125
Watching the sunset.

01:41:26.917 --> 01:41:27.833
Oh.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.458
Then what?

01:41:34.208 --> 01:41:35.458
Don't know.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.375
Concentrate.

01:43:38.917 --> 01:43:39.708
You hungry?

01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:41.458
Are you?

01:43:46.958 --> 01:43:48.375
Let me cook you something.

01:43:48.458 --> 01:43:49.458
No.

01:43:51.042 --> 01:43:51.708
I'll cook.

01:44:18.375 --> 01:44:21.000
Want to watch the sunrise?

01:44:21.792 --> 01:44:23.125
We could wait for it.
