Good evening, Ezron,

Good evening,
Homer the Thief.

01:38.190 --> 01:39.350
How is business?

01:39.430 --> 01:41.270
Been a little slow
these past few months.

01:41.330 --> 01:42.930
Not much to steal
in the desert, you know.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.670
Do not worry, my friend.
I figure we'll be

My wife sends her

01:53.080 --> 01:55.780
Ah yes.
She is a good woman-- <i>very good.</i>

02:07.690 --> 02:09.330
Quick!
Everybody look busy!

02:11.260 --> 02:13.630
The Lord has handed down to us

02:13.700 --> 02:16.100
ten commandments
by which to live.

02:16.170 --> 02:19.840
I will now read them
in no particular order.

02:19.900 --> 02:22.710
"Thou shalt not make
any graven images."

02:22.770 --> 02:24.110
Oh, my God!

"Thou shalt not
commit adultery."

02:26.780 --> 02:27.950
Ah, well.

02:28.010 --> 02:29.950
Looks like
the party's over.

Hey, Moses,
keep them coming!

02:32.650 --> 02:34.720
"Thou shalt not steal."

02:34.780 --> 02:36.580
D-ohhh!

02:36.650 --> 02:37.860
Sorry, Homer.

02:44.530 --> 02:45.560
That is the most
dishonest thing

02:45.630 --> 02:47.300
I've ever heard!

02:47.360 --> 02:49.290
I should box
your ears!

You... you...

Hey Flanders,

02:55.540 --> 02:57.610
who put that bug

02:57.670 --> 03:01.240
I wanted to subscribe to that
new arts and crafts channel.

03:01.310 --> 03:03.880
Well, sir. They send over this
flimflam man to install it.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.280
You know what he did?

03:05.350 --> 03:07.720
He offered
to hook me up illegally

03:07.780 --> 03:09.910
to every cable channel
for only 50 bucks.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.590
Boy, what's this world
coming to?

03:12.650 --> 03:14.220
That's exactly what I...

03:14.290 --> 03:15.160
Got to go!

03:15.220 --> 03:17.490
Hey, stop, cable man!

03:17.560 --> 03:18.300
Stop!

03:23.270 --> 03:24.800
What do <i>you want?</i>

03:24.870 --> 03:26.770
I want free cable.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.610
So...

03:28.670 --> 03:31.040
This is okay, isn't it?
I mean everybody does it, right?

03:31.110 --> 03:33.440
What? Oh, hey, if you're
having second thoughts

03:33.510 --> 03:34.950
just read this pamphlet.

03:40.780 --> 03:44.410
"Fact: cable companies

( <i>laughing )</i>

04:02.100 --> 04:04.770
Oh, it's funny 'cause it's true.

Oh!

Hey. Hey, family.

04:08.110 --> 04:09.650
Family, come here.

I have an announcement to make.

Cable?!
Cable?!

That's right.

04:25.690 --> 04:27.690
We talked about
cable before.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.890
You really think
we can afford it?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.270
Nothing a month.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.230
Yeah, I think we can
swing that.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.810
Are you sure this is legal?

Oh, that's
a good idea.

Today's topic

06:23.950 --> 06:25.380
will be hell.

All right.

I've sat through mercy
and forgiveness.

Finally, we get to
the good stuff.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.450
Oh, hell is
a terrible place.

Maggots are your sheet,
worms your blanket.

<i>There's a lake

You'll be tormented

06:41.100 --> 06:43.570
As a matter of fact,
If you actually saw hell

06:43.630 --> 06:46.470

06:46.540 --> 06:48.410
Oh, Miss Albright?
Yes, Bart?

06:48.470 --> 06:51.210
Wouldn't you eventually
get used to it,
like in a hot tub?

06:51.270 --> 06:52.300
No.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.370
Yes, Bart.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.980
Are there pirates in hell?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.670
Yes, thousands of them.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.420
Ooh-ooh, baby.

06:58.480 --> 07:02.250
So what you're saying is,
there's a down side
to the afterlife.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.490
How does one
steer clear

07:03.550 --> 07:04.960
of this abode
of the damned?

07:05.020 --> 07:07.730

The Ten Commandments.

Hell.
Bart!

07:20.970 --> 07:22.410
Well that's what we
learned about.

I sure as hell can't tell you

<i>hell, can I?</i>

<i>Cry Yuma and
<i>Here Comes the Coast Guard.</i></i>

07:57.570 --> 08:00.200
But today, I'd like
to talk to you about a
pleasant tasting candy

that actually cleans and
straightens your teeth.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.480
Oh, goody,
a program-length advertisement.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.020
Wait a minute, Troy.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.650
I'm a little confused.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.290
Did you say,
"Cleans <i>and straightens"?</i>

08:11.350 --> 08:14.450
There's no confusion, Tina--
just good science.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.680
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:08.110 --> 09:10.110
Don't you remember
the eighth commandment?

09:10.180 --> 09:11.220
Well, of course.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.020
It's "Thou shalt not..."

um... "covet... graven...

Thou shalt not steal!

Oh.

Anything else?

09:26.030 --> 09:28.030
Yes, I ate two grapes.

Please charge me for them.

Oh, two grapes?

Who cares?

Just charge me
something, please.

Okay, all right.

Oh, great.

All right, what
makes you say that?

09:57.660 --> 09:59.900
Well, in Sunday School,
we learned that stealing
is a sin.

09:59.960 --> 10:00.900
Well, duh.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.220
But everybody does it.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.870
I mean, we're stealing
cable as we speak.

10:03.930 --> 10:06.200
Oh, uh... look
at it this way--

10:06.270 --> 10:08.910
when you had
breakfast this morning,
did <i>you pay for it?</i>

10:08.970 --> 10:11.310
No.
And did you pay for
those clothes you're wearing?

10:11.370 --> 10:12.700
No, I didn't.

Well, run for the hills,

pretty spurious.

Well thank you, honey.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.320
Announcer:
<i>Friday night</i>

10:21.380 --> 10:24.080
live from Las Vegas,
the ultimate matchup:

10:26.690 --> 10:27.560
Ooh!

10:27.620 --> 10:29.180
It's <i>Watson-Tatum Two.</i>

10:29.260 --> 10:30.900
This time, it's for <i>money!</i>

10:30.960 --> 10:32.360
Oh, boy!

10:32.430 --> 10:34.900
<i>Only on the
Blockbuster Channel!</i>

10:34.960 --> 10:37.490
( <i>enthusiastic kissing )</i>

10:37.570 --> 10:40.270
How can one,
little insulated wire

10:40.340 --> 10:42.170
bring so much happiness?

10:42.240 --> 10:43.340
( <i>kissing )</i>

10:43.410 --> 10:44.180
( <i>sighs )</i>

10:46.840 --> 10:48.980
Lenny:
<i>Hey, big fight coming up.</i>

10:49.040 --> 10:50.400
Carl:
<i>Yeah, you want to come over to
my house and listen</i>

10:50.480 --> 10:52.350
to round-by-round updates
on the radio?

10:52.410 --> 10:56.340
Oh, yeah, okay, and then
after the fight, we can watch
the still photos

10:56.420 --> 10:57.860
on the 11:00 news.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.120
Not too shabby.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.420
What do you say, Homer?

11:00.490 --> 11:03.130
Eh... we could do that,
uh, yeah...

11:03.190 --> 11:05.560
or we could go over to my house

11:05.630 --> 11:09.000
and watch the whole thing
<i>live on cable TV!</i>

11:09.060 --> 11:11.660
Wow!
Get off!
You're kidding me!

11:11.730 --> 11:12.760
Heh-heh.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.700
Pass the pumice, please.

11:14.770 --> 11:16.810
He's Homer Simpson, sir--
one of your drones
from Sector 7G

11:16.870 --> 11:18.080
Excellent!

11:18.140 --> 11:21.550
I'm so keen on seeing
<i>Watson vs. Tatum Two</i>

11:21.610 --> 11:23.650
I'd even go
to an employee's house.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.540
I can picture it now--

11:26.620 --> 11:29.820
the screen door
rusting off its filthy hinges

11:29.880 --> 11:31.810
mangy dog staggering about

11:31.890 --> 11:34.190
looking vainly
for a place to die.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.290
Permission to speak frankly sir?

11:35.360 --> 11:36.930
Permission granted.

11:36.990 --> 11:38.330
Well, you are quite
wealthy...

11:38.390 --> 11:39.620
Thank you, Smithers.

11:39.690 --> 11:41.720
Your candor is most refreshing.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.700
No, I mean, why don't you pay
for the fight yourself?

11:44.770 --> 11:48.840
Dah! Smithers, a big title fight
is one of those rare occasions

11:48.900 --> 11:51.500
that I savor the sights,
sounds and...

11:51.570 --> 11:52.630
( <i>sniffs )</i>

11:52.710 --> 11:55.010
Ah, yes--
the smells of other men.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.310
You haven't lost
the common touch, sir.

11:57.380 --> 12:00.520
So, Homer,
I hear you got the fight.

12:00.580 --> 12:01.920
Yeah,
that's right.

12:01.980 --> 12:03.280
8:00, my place.

12:03.350 --> 12:04.590
Come one, come all.

12:04.650 --> 12:06.410
All right!

12:06.490 --> 12:10.160
All right! Moe, how come you
never got cable for the bar?

12:10.230 --> 12:14.060
Well, it was either cable
or the mechanical bull.

12:14.130 --> 12:16.730
I made my choice
and I stand by it.

12:18.630 --> 12:20.860
Ooh! Somebody's
having a party.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.140
Friday night--
you want to come over?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.170
Thank you

12:24.240 --> 12:25.880
but this store is open 24 hours.

12:25.940 --> 12:28.150
It puts great demands
on my time.

12:28.210 --> 12:30.850
Too bad. It's going
to be a great fight.

12:30.910 --> 12:32.040
Oh, the fight!

12:32.110 --> 12:33.570
Why didn't you say
something?

12:33.650 --> 12:36.090
I'll get my brother Sanjee
to cover for me.

12:36.150 --> 12:37.890
He deplores all violence
of all kinds.

12:37.950 --> 12:40.350
Lisa:
<i>So, even if a man takes bread</i>

12:40.420 --> 12:43.660
to feed his starving family,
that would be stealing?

12:43.730 --> 12:46.700
No... well, it is if
he puts anything on it.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.130
Jelly, for example.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.670
I see.

12:49.730 --> 12:52.000
Lisa, you're here
for a reason.

12:52.070 --> 12:54.210
Is your father
stealing bread?

12:54.270 --> 12:57.240
Maybe. I don't watch him
every minute.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.980
But what I am sure of is,
we're getting cable for free.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.850
Well, I'm afraid that
<i>is stealing, Lisa</i>

13:02.910 --> 13:05.320
and I think you
must do something.

13:05.380 --> 13:06.680
Should I have my
father arrested?

13:06.750 --> 13:08.850
Well Lisa, on the surface,
that would appear

13:08.920 --> 13:11.520
to be an ideal solution
to the problem

13:11.590 --> 13:13.690
but remember
the fifth commandment--

13:13.760 --> 13:16.330
"Honor thy father
and thy mother."

13:16.390 --> 13:19.300
Lisa, I would like to see
you set an example

13:19.360 --> 13:20.700
by not watching

13:20.760 --> 13:23.070
the offending technology
yourself.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.940
Thank you, Reverend Lovejoy.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.300
Female:
<i>You're watching
Top Hat Entertainment--</i>

13:27.370 --> 13:30.440
<i>adult programming,
all day, every day</i>

13:30.510 --> 13:32.910
<i>except in Florida and Utah.</i>

13:32.970 --> 13:35.840
Coming up next:
<i>Stardust Mammaries</i>

13:35.910 --> 13:38.150
( <i>music playing )</i>

13:38.210 --> 13:39.340
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

13:39.410 --> 13:40.270
Bart!

13:40.350 --> 13:41.020
Dad!

13:41.080 --> 13:42.180
Oh!

13:42.250 --> 13:44.490
Here's what I
was looking for.

13:44.550 --> 13:45.910
<i>...Blue chips closed up
3 and 3 quarters.</i>

13:45.990 --> 13:49.090
<i>Oil service stocks
slumped slightly...</i>

13:49.160 --> 13:51.600
Son, you shouldn't watch
that other channel.

13:51.660 --> 13:55.070
It's only for Mommies and
Daddies who love each other
very much.

13:55.130 --> 13:58.770
I want you to promise me
you won't watch that channel
ever again.

13:58.830 --> 13:59.530
- Okay.
- Promise me.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.640
I promise.

14:00.700 --> 14:01.770
I will never watch that
channel again.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.210
Good boy.

14:03.270 --> 14:05.540
Hi Dad. I think
stealing cable is wrong

14:05.610 --> 14:07.180
so I'm choosing
not to watch it

14:07.240 --> 14:09.350
<i>in the hope others
will follow my example</i>

14:09.410 --> 14:12.350
It's the last you'll hear
from me on the matter.
Thank you for your time.

14:12.410 --> 14:13.340
Hey, Lisa...

14:13.420 --> 14:15.020
Racing from Belmont?

14:15.080 --> 14:16.210
Horsies!

14:16.280 --> 14:19.380
Sorry, I'd rather
go to heaven.

14:19.450 --> 14:21.480
Homer:
<i>There's something wrong
with that kid.</i>

14:21.560 --> 14:23.060
She's so moral.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.150
Why can't she
be more like..?

14:25.230 --> 14:26.730
Well, not like Bart

14:26.800 --> 14:29.000
but there's gotta be
a happy medium.

14:29.060 --> 14:31.690
Well, you know

14:31.770 --> 14:34.410
Bart <i>was looking
at that racy movie today</i>

14:34.470 --> 14:37.910
and Lisa's losing
a little respect for you.

14:37.970 --> 14:42.000
Maybe we should think about...
unhooking the cable.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.010
Unhook it?!

14:43.080 --> 14:44.420
But I love cable.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.580
Then maybe you
should pay for it.

14:46.650 --> 14:48.490
D-ohh! Look, Marge

14:48.550 --> 14:51.960
I can't afford it.
When I can afford
to pay for it, I will

14:52.020 --> 14:53.360
but I can't,
so I'm not going to.

14:53.420 --> 14:54.160
Homer

14:54.220 --> 14:55.730
I'm afraid that

14:55.790 --> 14:56.760
cable has become

14:56.830 --> 14:58.160
an evil presence in our home.

14:58.230 --> 15:02.400
- Marge, I never put my foot
down about anything,

15:02.460 --> 15:03.190
No...

15:03.260 --> 15:04.490
but I am severely tempted

15:04.570 --> 15:05.400
to do it over this.

15:05.470 --> 15:06.670
Oh, Homer.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.400
Marge, I'm sorry.
I think it's coming down.

15:08.470 --> 15:09.710
No, Homer...

15:09.770 --> 15:11.480
It's coming down..My foot...
That's it, Marge!

15:11.540 --> 15:12.640
It's coming down.

15:12.710 --> 15:13.810
The cable stays.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.010
The foot has spoken.

15:15.080 --> 15:15.900
( <i>loud thud )</i>

15:15.960 --> 15:17.230
Please.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.170
Seen it.

15:18.230 --> 15:19.100
<i>...Cleans and straightens...</i>

15:19.160 --> 15:20.120
Seen it.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.100
( <i>rap music )</i>

15:21.170 --> 15:22.240
Seen it.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.100
<i>I was poor...
Seen it.</i>

15:23.170 --> 15:24.770
Ugh, soccer.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.740
Seen it.

15:25.800 --> 15:26.730
Hey, Simpson.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.830
What?

15:27.910 --> 15:29.480
How did you
get in here?

15:29.540 --> 15:32.210
Your door wasn't locked
in any serious way.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.380
I wonder if you'd be
interested in this car stereo?

15:34.450 --> 15:38.190
A $500 value, but I'll let you
have it for 40 bucks.

15:38.250 --> 15:41.060
Get out of my house!
I don't want to associate
with criminals.

15:41.120 --> 15:41.820
Maybe I'll go see
your neighbor.

15:41.890 --> 15:42.990
He's not home.

15:43.050 --> 15:44.050
Even better.

15:46.290 --> 15:49.760
( <i>locks turning )</i>

15:49.830 --> 15:52.070
Are you sure
you want do this?

15:52.130 --> 15:53.470
It doesn't
look friendly.

15:53.530 --> 15:55.140
We can't be too careful.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.900
There are thieves are everywhere

15:56.970 --> 16:01.210
and I'm not talking about
the small, forgivable stuff.

16:01.270 --> 16:02.830
Come one, come all.

16:02.910 --> 16:05.580
Top Hat Theater
is on the air.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.270
The most beautiful women
in the world.

16:08.350 --> 16:09.280
Just 50 cents.

16:09.350 --> 16:11.350
I am your host, Bart Simpson.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.390

You must be at least eight
years old to enter.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.350
<i>Broadcast Nudes.</i>

16:21.430 --> 16:22.730
All:
Ooh.

16:22.790 --> 16:24.120
Gross!

16:24.200 --> 16:25.700
Yet strangely
compelling.

16:25.760 --> 16:26.820
Homer:
Huh?!

16:26.900 --> 16:27.840
It's a raid!

16:27.900 --> 16:28.840
What the..?

16:28.900 --> 16:30.170
What are these kids..?

16:30.240 --> 16:31.170
Hey!

16:31.240 --> 16:32.310
I know you.

16:32.370 --> 16:33.540
Come back here!

16:35.270 --> 16:38.840
Bart, you promised me you
wouldn't watch that trash.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.050
Now go to your room!

16:40.110 --> 16:42.080
Man, I wish I was an adult

16:42.150 --> 16:44.450
- so I could break the rules.
- Oh great.

16:47.490 --> 16:48.520
Here.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.660
I brought some imported
generic beer.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.060
Thank you, Barney.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.080
How many people
are coming?

16:54.160 --> 16:56.960
Just a select circle
of my friends.

16:57.030 --> 16:58.100
Oh, hello, Mrs. Homer.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.620
I brought an assortment
of jerkies.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.440
Ooh, did you swipe those
from work?

17:01.500 --> 17:02.440
Certainly not.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.810
What has been implied here?

17:04.869 --> 17:08.440
Man:
No, there is no love lost
between these two warriors.

17:08.510 --> 17:10.180
In fact, we almost had a scuffle

17:10.240 --> 17:12.250
earlier today
at the weigh-in.

17:12.310 --> 17:14.720
I understand you have
a special motivation

17:14.780 --> 17:16.180
going into this bout.

17:16.250 --> 17:19.290
Yeah. I wanna dedicate
this fight to my
manager Vinnie

17:19.349 --> 17:21.089
who got me here, and then

17:21.150 --> 17:22.680
( <i>sobbing )</i>

17:22.750 --> 17:25.680
passed away just two weeks ago.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.130
Any response to that?

17:27.190 --> 17:29.760
Yeth, I would altho like
to dedicate thith fight

17:29.830 --> 17:31.730
to the memory of his
deceased manager.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.030
You can't do that.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.870
I can do
whatever I want.

17:34.930 --> 17:36.430
You dedicate the fight
to <i>your manager.</i>

17:36.500 --> 17:38.910
I just want to call attention
to the fact

17:38.970 --> 17:41.510
that I'm not watching
this fight.

17:41.570 --> 17:43.830
It's my form
of nonviolent protest.

17:43.910 --> 17:44.880
( <i>doorbell rings )</i>

17:46.110 --> 17:47.980
Hi, Homer.
I brought...

17:48.050 --> 17:49.220
Quick!

17:49.280 --> 17:50.280
It's Moe!

17:50.350 --> 17:51.890
I got to hide the mugs.

17:55.990 --> 17:57.320
Will you..?

17:57.390 --> 17:59.590
Hey, go protest
outside, will you?

17:59.660 --> 18:00.690
Now!

18:01.830 --> 18:03.460
Hi, Homer.

18:03.530 --> 18:04.770
I brought you a mug.

18:04.830 --> 18:05.770
Ooh!

18:05.830 --> 18:06.770
Thank you, Moe.

18:06.830 --> 18:08.900
I always wanted one of these.

18:10.770 --> 18:12.070
Mr. Burns!

18:13.740 --> 18:14.810
Bart, quick--

18:14.870 --> 18:16.630
Hide the stuff
I borrowed from work.

18:16.710 --> 18:17.850
Borrowed?

18:17.910 --> 18:19.880
Alright, the stuff
I stole from work.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.040
Oh, okay.

18:25.550 --> 18:29.120
Take all this and this--
put it in the closet.

18:29.190 --> 18:32.030
Will you quit staring
at me like that?

18:32.090 --> 18:34.460
Oh, hello, Simpson.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.730
We were just
in the neighborhood

18:36.790 --> 18:38.390
and thought we'd drop by.

18:38.460 --> 18:40.120
Hello, Mr. Burns.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.370
Would you like
to watch the fight?

18:42.430 --> 18:43.690
The fight?

18:43.770 --> 18:45.740
Don't mind if I do.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.500
Oh, Simpson, good news.

18:47.570 --> 18:49.410
I brought some munchies.

18:49.470 --> 18:51.240
Smithers, the Cheetos.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.920
( both scream )
Our main event
is set to commence

18:56.980 --> 18:59.090
in but a few scant minutes.

18:59.150 --> 19:00.190
The anticipation...

19:00.250 --> 19:01.120
( screams )
You Homer Simpson?

19:01.190 --> 19:02.120
Yeah.

19:02.190 --> 19:03.790
Word on the street

19:03.860 --> 19:06.290
is that you have
an illegal cable hookup.

19:06.360 --> 19:07.290
No. It wasn't me.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.000
It was my wife's idea.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.270
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:11.330 --> 19:13.200
Settle down, big fella.

19:13.260 --> 19:16.430
We're just wondering
if we could watch the fight.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.570
Oh, sure, sure.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.040
Be my guest.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.950
Lisa, I brought you
some lemonade

19:25.010 --> 19:26.480
for your protest.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.010
Thanks, Mom.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.250
It doesn't seem
to be going very well.

19:30.310 --> 19:32.380
Well, don't give up.
When you love somebody

19:32.450 --> 19:35.420
you have to have faith
that in the end

19:35.490 --> 19:37.460
they will do
the right thing.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.640
Excuse me.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.970
I hate to interrupt
your judging me

20:25.040 --> 20:26.910
but I wanted you to know

20:26.970 --> 20:29.340
I've made a couple
of really important decisions.

20:29.410 --> 20:31.240
Number one,
I'm cutting the cable

20:31.310 --> 20:33.210
as soon as the fight's over

20:33.280 --> 20:34.310
and number two

20:34.380 --> 20:36.450
I'm not very fond
of any of you.

20:36.510 --> 20:38.080
Well, back to the fight.

20:38.150 --> 20:39.250
Get down, boy.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.660
Dad, we may have
saved your soul.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.760
<i>Tatum is reeling from the
exquisite haymaker...</i>

20:43.820 --> 20:46.060
Yeah, at the worst
possible time.

20:48.060 --> 20:51.260

20:53.060 --> 20:55.890

20:55.970 --> 20:58.070
A stunning knockout
by a thunderous bolo punch

20:58.140 --> 21:00.840
in the closing seconds
of the 12th round

21:00.910 --> 21:03.180

for blueberry Squishees

21:06.080 --> 21:07.580
and microwave burritos.

21:07.650 --> 21:10.080
The greatest fight ever

21:10.150 --> 21:12.050
and I missed it.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.390
We're really proud
of you, Dad.

21:14.450 --> 21:15.990
What a donnybrook, eh?

21:16.050 --> 21:18.820
Hogwash. Why I once watched
Gentleman Jim Corbett

21:18.890 --> 21:20.960
fight an Eskimo fellow
bare-knuckled

21:21.030 --> 21:22.560
for 113 rounds.

21:22.630 --> 21:25.570
Back then, of course,
if a fight lasted
less then 50 rounds

21:25.630 --> 21:27.470
we demanded our nickel back.

21:27.530 --> 21:29.070
Cable clippers, please.

21:29.130 --> 21:30.930
Here you go, Homey.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.970
Go for it, Dad.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.570
Dad, I beg you to
reconsider.
