the audience with your show.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.350
Thanks, but I feel bad for Jackson.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.020
Oh, he's gone.
You don't have to fake concern.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.065
Oh, you're serious?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.778
You're such a better person than I am.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.156
Hello, Fernando.

13:03.115 --> 13:07.119
Hello, Maximillian, or Maxwell,
or Max something. I don't care.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.749
This fight's been coming on a long time.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.002
Now suit up and let's dance.

13:18.589 --> 13:22.051
Ramona, bring Papa his fencing gear.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.557
Yeah, I'm gonna go text my friends
that I'm doing the show, but have fun.

13:33.062 --> 13:37.191
Oh, hey, Jimmy, honey.
Look, how cool is this?

13:37.525 --> 13:40.110
Whoa! That is awesome.

13:42.905 --> 13:43.739
What is it?

13:45.616 --> 13:47.117
It's my mom's wedding veil.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.036
I'm gonna use it
for my something borrowed.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.539
Oh. That's a great idea.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.542
Well, that must bring back
a bunch of memories, huh?

13:55.209 --> 13:56.210
It sure does.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.129
What's your favorite memory of her?

14:00.714 --> 14:01.549
Well...

14:02.716 --> 14:04.885
there's just so many, you know?

14:05.219 --> 14:06.053
So many.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.557
But you have a bachelor party
to get to, so…

14:09.640 --> 14:10.641
Right,

14:10.724 --> 14:12.852
but first
I gotta stop by the hardware store

14:12.935 --> 14:14.270
and pick up some axes.

14:16.772 --> 14:19.984
Hey, I'm pretty sure the axe-throwing bar
will provide the axes.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.361
They do?

14:24.071 --> 14:26.448
Wow, this place is even classier
than I thought.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.158
[both laugh]

14:28.242 --> 14:29.159
Have fun.

14:32.246 --> 14:36.667
[vocalizing]

14:48.512 --> 14:50.264
Oh, guys, come on.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.936
Okay, let's get some axes
and start throwing them. [laughs]

14:56.020 --> 14:57.813
I mean, this looks like fun, right?

15:01.066 --> 15:04.695
Uh, this looks like something
we were taught explicitly not to do.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.450
I wish there was someone who could
teach us everything there is to know

15:09.533 --> 15:11.201
about axe throwing, you know?

15:11.535 --> 15:12.703
An axe-pert.

15:13.829 --> 15:17.124
Welcome to Axetastic. My name is Alex
and I'll be your axe-pert.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.334
Whoa.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.631
I wish we had ice cold beers.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.092
What? Yes!

15:27.176 --> 15:29.178
-Yes!
-Wow!

15:29.762 --> 15:30.804
First time for you guys?

15:32.056 --> 15:34.683
Oh, no. I posed with an axe once.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.394
I did a tool calendar
back in my modeling days. Ha.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.772
First-timers it is, all right.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.151
-So...
-Me first.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.237
Here's the key to axe throwing.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.323
You grab an axe...

15:50.991 --> 15:52.034
and you throw it.

15:54.036 --> 15:54.870
Oh!

15:54.954 --> 15:56.288
Oh, well, I can do that.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.749
Hey, guys, check this out.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.793
This is February.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.090
How do I not have this calendar?

16:06.590 --> 16:07.424
Yeah, right?

16:08.592 --> 16:09.468
Okay, here we go.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.099
Bullseye-adjacent.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.101
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.728
All right, little guy. You give it a try.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.481
He called me little.
The wedding diet's working.

16:24.024 --> 16:24.942
Go!

16:27.152 --> 16:28.779
I just... All right.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.865
[guys] Whoa! Whoa!

16:32.533 --> 16:35.619
That felt axe-tastic.
Hey, that's how they got the name, right?

16:37.454 --> 16:38.664
Just... Okay.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.460
-Sweet cheese!
-[both imitate electric guitar]

16:43.544 --> 16:45.796
Hey, everybody. Check this guy out.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.426
Bro, what's your secret?
Are you a fireman? A lumberjack?

16:51.093 --> 16:52.469
I'm a podiatrist.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.056
Look, Kurt, this guy can't miss.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.141
What, this clown?

16:57.224 --> 16:59.476
He doesn't look strong enough
to jump rope.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.978
[laughs]

17:01.061 --> 17:04.189
On the playground, I was known
for my double-dutch.

17:04.982 --> 17:05.816
Whoo!

17:05.899 --> 17:08.736
[bar patrons cheering]

17:10.571 --> 17:12.239
Aw!

17:12.656 --> 17:16.243
This little foot fella
is about to break your record.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.580
Well, maybe I ought to break
something of his.

17:19.663 --> 17:20.873
No, no, no.

17:20.956 --> 17:22.750
I can miss. I know I can.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.462
[all cheering, shouting]

17:30.799 --> 17:31.967
I wouldn't count that.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.391
Jackson, Ethan's driving me
to dress rehearsal.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.060
Anything you want me to tell the cast?

17:43.145 --> 17:44.063
Jackson?

17:45.522 --> 17:48.484
[muffled dance music
playing through headphones]

17:57.785 --> 18:00.204
How many times do I have to catch you
in a lie about being sick

18:00.287 --> 18:01.580
in the exact same way?

18:04.041 --> 18:05.876
I can't help it. I dance when I lie.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.588
I have guilty feet.

18:12.382 --> 18:15.385
You're pretending to be sick because
you're afraid to do the show, aren't you?

18:15.469 --> 18:17.262
That is so unfair to everyone
who works hard--

18:17.346 --> 18:19.431
Okay, I'm faking,
but not for the reason you think.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.310
Look, I know what a big deal
this play is for you.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.395
I wanted to give you a shot.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.235
Wait, you did this for me?

18:33.028 --> 18:35.447
Why would you do that?
You rehearsed for weeks.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.199
You're moving.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.034
This is your last show at our school.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.996
And honestly, I wanted to see you kill it.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.335
Jackson, I don't know what to say.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.839
This part was so important to you.

18:52.631 --> 18:53.841
I know, it is.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.802
But you're more important.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.307
Ramona, when you first moved in here,

19:03.350 --> 19:04.434
I wasn't happy about it.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.896
But now, we've been through so much.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.859
Well, I feel like you're my sister.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.406
I feel the same way.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.953
As your sister, can I say something?

19:23.537 --> 19:24.580
Absolutely.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.582
Quit being a butthead.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.836
You earned this part.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.421
You put in the work.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.048
[sighs] But you wanted this part so badly.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.594
Jackson, you deserve this shot.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.430
Honestly, I want to see you kill it.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.808
Grab your stuff.
We'll be late to rehearsal.

19:44.892 --> 19:45.851
Are you sure?

19:46.059 --> 19:48.312
About calling you a butthead?
Oh, 100 percent.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.693
This is your last chance to give up.

19:55.986 --> 19:56.862
Ha!

19:59.865 --> 20:01.033
[Max] En garde.

[Max] Not available! Dueling!

Vengeance is sweeter than milkshakes!

20:45.911 --> 20:48.163
[swords clattering]

20:48.247 --> 20:50.374
When you move out, you're gonna miss that.

Go ahead, you can gloat now.

Okay, I win.

21:18.902 --> 21:19.736
Yay.

21:22.114 --> 21:26.785
Little Galahad, why are you so sad
in the hour of your greatest triumph?

21:31.999 --> 21:33.375
I don't want you to move away.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.546
But why, Max?

21:38.046 --> 21:40.549
Ever since we met,
I've been a thorn in your side.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.553
Yeah, I know but...

21:47.097 --> 21:48.849
when you move away, this place will just…

21:49.808 --> 21:51.435
It'll feel a little bit less like home.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.480
I mean...

21:56.356 --> 21:57.816
you drive me nuts, Fernando.

22:01.820 --> 22:02.863
But you get me.

22:05.866 --> 22:06.700
Oh, dear.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.417
Did you put on your mask
to hide your tears?

22:19.713 --> 22:20.964
[Fernando's voice breaking] No.

22:27.971 --> 22:31.808
I have a lot of mixed emotions about
moving away from the house of Fuller.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.396
But I realize now that...

22:37.189 --> 22:38.774
I'm especially sad that...

22:39.733 --> 22:42.903
I won't get to see you every day.

22:45.906 --> 22:46.865
[Max sighs]

22:49.826 --> 22:50.994
Don't worry, Max.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.748
You'll still see way more of me
than anyone wants to.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.298
Hey, what are you doing up here?

23:03.799 --> 23:06.802
Oh, I just thought it was
a little bit cluttery up here earlier,

23:06.885 --> 23:08.678
so I thought I'd come tidy up.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.972
Oh, yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.307
Wait a minute.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.769
We never think the same thing.
One of us is lying.

23:17.437 --> 23:18.605
Okay, fine.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.025
I'm up here
looking for my new something borrowed.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.778
I thought you were gonna wear Mom's veil.

23:25.862 --> 23:26.988
I was, but...

23:28.698 --> 23:31.493
I don't know, after talking to Jimmy,
I realized I've...

23:32.244 --> 23:34.663
got some emotions
bubbling to the surface.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.957
You know I don't do emotions.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.462
Well, we don't have to talk about it.

23:43.964 --> 23:44.840
Thanks.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.553
I don't remember Mom.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.016
What are you talking about?

23:56.476 --> 23:59.438
When Jimmy asked me
what my favorite memory of her was,

24:00.439 --> 24:03.775
I realized that the only memories
that I have

24:03.859 --> 24:07.279
are from pictures
or stories that you told me.

24:08.947 --> 24:11.408
Well, you were only five when she passed.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.327
I know.

24:16.705 --> 24:17.831
Just makes me sad.

24:19.332 --> 24:21.710
I feel like I've lost
that connection with her.

24:23.795 --> 24:27.048
[sniffles]
And the veil just reminds me more of that.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.093

24:35.932 --> 24:38.226
Hey, I, um...

24:39.811 --> 24:42.481
I think I know a place
that might jog your memory.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.358
Really?

24:47.694 --> 24:48.778
Thanks, Deej.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.073
You're the best big sister ever.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.413
Well, I like taking care of my little sis.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.959
I can't believe you're moving out.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.214
And now,
I'm gonna have to reapply my makeup.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.590
Thanks a lot, Steph.

Hey, Steve, check it out.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.140

Whoo, sweet!

25:20.894 --> 25:24.147

around Daytona Beach in a second.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.775
It's really, really great.

25:26.858 --> 25:30.111
But just out of curiosity,
is there, like, a giant, menacing guy

25:30.195 --> 25:32.197
staring at me from down the bar?

25:33.573 --> 25:34.491
[weakly] No.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.244
He's right behind you.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.203
[groans]

25:38.870 --> 25:40.163
You don't belong here, buddy.

25:40.247 --> 25:43.542
You are so right, large,
intimidating fellow. I'm just gonna go--

25:43.625 --> 25:46.419
No, no, no.
You leave when I say you leave.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.005
Okay, you know what?
Quit hassling our friend here.

25:49.089 --> 25:52.175
Paul Bunyan thought he could walk in here
and break my record.

25:52.259 --> 25:54.177
Oh, my gosh, Paul Bunyan.

25:54.261 --> 25:58.014
The rare intersection
between lumberjacking and podiatry.

25:58.098 --> 26:01.768
You, sir, may be a bully,
but you are also a genius.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.898
Okay, you want a piece of him,
you're gonna have to get through me.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.484
Great! I get to beat up two guys today.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.986
Make that three.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.405
Four! What are we counting?

26:15.532 --> 26:18.201
Counting the number of guys who are
going to take a beating for Steve.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.500
None of you guys
have been in a fight before, have you?

26:26.084 --> 26:27.252
Hold on, you know what?

26:27.335 --> 26:29.045
Let me tell you something about this guy

26:29.129 --> 26:31.965
that you're about to beat up,
break in half, and throw in a ditch.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.468
Why are you giving him ideas?

26:38.638 --> 26:40.890
This guy, he healed my heart

26:40.974 --> 26:43.143
when I didn't think
it could be put back together again.

26:43.226 --> 26:46.104
And when the chips are down,
I know he's got my back.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.982
That's why I will forever have his.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.402
Are we doing dramatic speeches?

26:53.612 --> 26:55.238
Wonderful.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.826
Esteban, I never thanked you

26:59.909 --> 27:02.621
for setting an example
for me to strive for.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.124
You taught me to be a better me.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.293
No one thought that was possible.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.880
You knew, so...

27:12.297 --> 27:16.384
I will proudly take a beating
on his behalf.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.511
Yeah, giant guy.

27:19.429 --> 27:22.599
Steve taught me how to make
the perfect grilled cheese sandwich.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.809
The key is a bit of paprika
smeared with mayonnaise--

27:24.893 --> 27:27.937
-Jimmy, I'm not sure that's relevant.
-Not now, Steve. I'm on a roll.

27:29.439 --> 27:33.485
Steve has always been there for me,
even when I didn't know I needed it.

27:33.568 --> 27:37.530
I'm just sad you've clearly never had
a friend as good as Steve before.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.245
[whimpering, crying]

27:46.498 --> 27:48.583
These guys really love you, man.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.168
Oh!

27:51.294 --> 27:53.963
Oh! I wish I had BFFs like them.

27:55.590 --> 27:56.841
Are you crying again?

27:57.258 --> 27:58.343
Let's go.

28:06.267 --> 28:07.227
[sighs] Oh!

28:07.310 --> 28:10.814
Guys, we wanted a crazy night.
We got one. Whoo!

28:10.897 --> 28:13.441
We're almost as crazy
as the She-Wolf Pack.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.943
Woo-hoo-hoo!

28:15.026 --> 28:17.362
Hey, we need our own name.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.781
-Oh!
-How about the He-Wolves?

28:20.198 --> 28:22.909
How about the Booyah Boys?

28:23.326 --> 28:24.703
Maybe we don't need a name.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.663
Too late!

28:27.163 --> 28:27.997
Booyah!

28:28.415 --> 28:29.958
[all] Booyah!

28:30.041 --> 28:31.209
That does feel right.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.094
So, you recognize this place?

28:42.178 --> 28:43.012
No.

28:43.596 --> 28:44.556
I wish I did.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.850
Nice going, DJ.

28:49.352 --> 28:52.564
Chocolate milkshake with whipped cream
and two cherries, please.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.609
Oh, wait.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.028
That was my order.

29:00.071 --> 29:03.450
I remember. Mom used to bring us here
for milkshakes after dance class.

29:04.617 --> 29:07.078
Nice going, DJ.
I knew this plan would work.

29:09.622 --> 29:10.749
Feeling better, then?

29:11.583 --> 29:15.420
Well, I'm a little concerned that girl
might be the ghost version of me, but...

29:16.963 --> 29:21.426
No, it's nice to know that there are
things I can actually re-remember.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.137
Thanks for giving me back
this memory of Mom.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.266
And it's yours forever to keep.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.605
Hey, Deej. We made it.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.315
Oh, hey!

29:35.398 --> 29:37.525
Make way for the Booyah Boys!

29:39.402 --> 29:40.779
And the rest.

29:41.946 --> 29:48.912
[overlapping chatter]

29:50.038 --> 29:51.289
What's everybody doing here?

29:51.372 --> 29:53.124
Oh, I sent a group text.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.668
We only have so many nights left together.

29:56.961 --> 29:57.796
Well...

29:57.879 --> 30:01.257
I don't have a wedding binder like DJ,
but I do have an announcement.

30:01.716 --> 30:04.093
All wedding planning
is now officially done.

30:04.177 --> 30:07.013
[all cheering]

30:07.096 --> 30:10.433
Yeah, I decided to use Mom's veil
as my something borrowed after all.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.477
And I'd like to change my mind

30:12.560 --> 30:15.688
and use Mom's wedding brooch
as my something borrowed.

30:16.105 --> 30:19.901
And with your permission, I would love
to use your mom's wedding necklace.

30:20.276 --> 30:23.196
It would be nice to honor the woman
who created my two besties.

30:23.279 --> 30:25.281
[all] Aw.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.868
Look at this family we've built.

30:29.869 --> 30:31.371
It's pretty dang perfect.

30:31.454 --> 30:33.540
I can't wait to get married with you all.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.460
["Build Me Up Buttercup" plays]

30:40.880 --> 30:43.174
"Build Me Up Buttercup."
This was Mom's favorite song.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.051
Yeah, it sure was.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.513
Thanks for the visit, Mom.
