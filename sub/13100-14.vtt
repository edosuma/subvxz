00:01.667 --> 00:04.375
[instrumental music]

00:04.458 --> 00:06.625
(Michael)
'Did you hear? They're putting
ISN back on-line.'

00:06.708 --> 00:08.875
Now, if ISN is broadcasting
the news again

00:08.958 --> 00:10.958
maybe that means
things are better back home.

00:11.042 --> 00:12.542
I mean, why else
would they allow it?

00:12.625 --> 00:13.875
I don't know, it took them
an awfully long time

00:13.958 --> 00:15.500
to get back on the air.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.083
Well, the place was shot up bad
by President Clark's troops.

00:18.167 --> 00:20.500
Probably took them this long
just to repair everything.

00:20.583 --> 00:23.042
This could be the first good
sign we've had in months.

00:27.333 --> 00:30.208
(man on TV)
'ISN, the galaxy's
most important network.'

00:30.292 --> 00:31.708
(woman on TV)
Good morning.

00:31.792 --> 00:34.417
The Interstellar Network News
is back on the air

00:34.500 --> 00:38.250
broadcasting throughout Earth
and to over two dozen colonies

00:38.333 --> 00:40.042
and deep-range outposts.

00:40.125 --> 00:43.000
The first thing we want to do
is explain what happened

00:43.083 --> 00:45.000
to cause the disruption
in service.

00:45.083 --> 00:46.167
See? Told you.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.625
...ISN News center
here in Geneva was lost

00:48.708 --> 00:52.125
when our facilities
were attacked by saboteurs

00:52.208 --> 00:55.708
intent on paralyzing all Earth
communications systems

00:55.792 --> 00:57.792
as a prelude to invasion.

00:57.875 --> 00:59.625
What?! That's a lie.

00:59.708 --> 01:01.708
In order to divide our forces

01:01.792 --> 01:04.042
the saboteurs
used our facilities

01:04.125 --> 01:06.458
report

01:06.542 --> 01:08.750
designed to create
the impression

01:08.833 --> 01:12.125
that the government itself
was taking action against us.

01:12.208 --> 01:15.625
To stop this campaign
of misinformation

01:15.708 --> 01:18.625
we ourselves pulled the plug
on the broadcast.

01:18.708 --> 01:21.083
'In the ensuing firefight
government forces'

01:21.167 --> 01:23.292
'recaptured the ISN facilities'

01:23.375 --> 01:25.375
'and apprehended the saboteurs.'

01:25.458 --> 01:28.167
'We've been working around
the clock to repair the damage'

01:28.250 --> 01:32.583
'and now, at last,
we're back better than ever.'

01:32.667 --> 01:34.167
Coming up in the next hour

01:34.250 --> 01:35.750
President Clark
accepts a report

01:35.833 --> 01:37.083
from the ministry of peace

01:37.167 --> 01:40.083
on how crime has been
virtually eliminated

01:40.167 --> 01:41.958
ever since
the extremely popular

01:42.042 --> 01:44.458
martial law
declaration was issued.

01:44.542 --> 01:46.667
Turn it off.

01:46.750 --> 01:50.000
You know, sometimes
I think I'm too pessimistic.

01:50.083 --> 01:51.333
I mean, what's wrong
with thinking, maybe

01:51.417 --> 01:52.958
things might work out
once in a while?

01:53.042 --> 01:54.542
And then something
like this happens.

01:54.625 --> 01:55.667
I mean, do they really think
the people

01:55.750 --> 01:56.708
are gonna fall for this?

01:56.792 --> 01:59.125
Why not? Worked before.

01:59.208 --> 02:01.958
He who controls information
controls the world.

02:02.042 --> 02:04.583
God, the captain is gonna
love it when he sees this.

02:04.667 --> 02:05.917
Where is he, anyway?

02:06.042 --> 02:07.792
He's being checked out
on the new Starfuries

02:07.875 --> 02:10.042
'we inherited
from the Churchill.'

02:10.125 --> 02:12.917
(male #1)
'So, the attitude controls
are pretty much the same'

02:13.000 --> 02:14.083
'but a lot more sensitive.'

02:14.167 --> 02:16.917
(John)
Yeah, I can feel the difference.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.042
Okay, I'm gonna try
the atmosphere wings.

02:20.042 --> 02:20.958
[device beeping]

02:21.042 --> 02:22.083
(John)
'Locking down.'

02:22.167 --> 02:24.208
[whirring]

02:26.292 --> 02:28.833
(male #1)
'This is the first
production model of Starfury'

02:28.917 --> 02:31.000
'that can operate
inside an atmosphere.'

02:31.083 --> 02:33.458
'No one else in a prior model
can follow you in.'

02:34.458 --> 02:35.542
Roger that.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.708
(female #1)
'Captain, we're picking up
a distress call'

02:44.792 --> 02:45.958
'in an outer sector.'

02:46.042 --> 02:47.792
- Earth or alien?
- 'Earth.'

02:47.875 --> 02:50.000
(female #1)
'Should we scramble
a search and rescue team?'

02:52.208 --> 02:53.583
No. We'll check it out.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.875
May as well give these things
a real workout.

02:55.958 --> 02:58.167
'I'll check in as soon
as we find out what it is.'

03:03.500 --> 03:06.667
'Echo 1 to damaged ship.
Can you receive?'

03:06.750 --> 03:08.458
'Echo 1 to damaged ship.'

03:08.542 --> 03:09.958
'Can you receive?'

03:10.042 --> 03:12.833
I hear you just fine, captain.

03:12.917 --> 03:15.667
But just get a little closer.

03:15.750 --> 03:17.250
We need to talk.

03:24.125 --> 03:25.500
(Susan)
The Babylon project

03:25.583 --> 03:28.583
was our last
best hope for peace.

03:32.333 --> 03:33.500
It failed.

03:33.583 --> 03:36.542
[dramatic music]

03:49.083 --> 03:50.625
But in the year
of the Shadow War

03:50.708 --> 03:53.042
it became something greater

03:53.125 --> 03:56.208
our last best hope
for victory.

04:01.125 --> 04:03.458
The year is 2260.

04:03.542 --> 04:06.083
The place...Babylon 5.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.417
[theme music]

04:39.375 --> 04:42.417
[music continues]

04:55.792 --> 04:57.875
We're close enough for a scan.

04:57.958 --> 04:59.250
Find out who's out here.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.500
'Echo 1 to Echo 2.'

05:04.583 --> 05:07.417
We've got a situation here.
Stand by.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.625
- 'Confirmed, captain.'
- 'This is Echo 1 to intruder.'

05:10.708 --> 05:12.792
You have entered
Babylon 5 space.

05:12.875 --> 05:15.042
Please identify yourself.

05:15.125 --> 05:18.208
(Bester)
'Captain, such formality.'

05:21.625 --> 05:24.542
- Bester?
- You recognize the voice.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.667
You've got a good ear.

05:26.750 --> 05:30.083
I'm...picking you up
on my instruments.

05:30.167 --> 05:34.208
But, you're not in visual range.
Is there a problem?

05:34.292 --> 05:37.708
(John)
'I noticed the Black Omega
insignia on your Starfury.'

05:37.792 --> 05:40.750
Black Omega is an elite unit
attached to Psi Corps.

05:40.833 --> 05:44.042
Telepath can only scan you if
you're on a direct line of sight

05:44.125 --> 05:47.208
so I'm making damn sure
we don't get that close.

05:47.292 --> 05:51.167
(Bester)
'Very good. I have something
for you, captain.'

05:51.250 --> 05:53.250
Something very important.

05:53.333 --> 05:56.042
If I came in unannounced
your people would shoot me down

05:56.125 --> 05:59.708
before I got within
two kilometers of Babylon 5.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.917
Mr. Bester, we no longer
have any ties to Earth

06:03.000 --> 06:05.083
or to the Psi Corps.

06:05.167 --> 06:08.792
So we don't have to put up
with you or your games.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.958
Now, I am sitting
on four brand new

06:11.042 --> 06:12.833
unidirectional pulse cannons..

06:14.208 --> 06:15.583
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't

06:15.667 --> 06:17.375
blow you out of the sky.

06:17.458 --> 06:20.458
Because you are curious?

06:20.542 --> 06:22.292
Kill me and you'll never know

06:22.375 --> 06:24.708
what brought me
all the way out here.

06:24.792 --> 06:28.625
I think if you weigh that
against the brief satisfaction

06:28.708 --> 06:31.958
of blowing me out of the sky

06:32.042 --> 06:33.583
you'll do the right thing.

06:41.500 --> 06:45.417
- Captain?
- 'I'm thinking it over.'

06:45.500 --> 06:46.542
Ah.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.125
Good.

06:50.208 --> 06:53.292
(John)
'Echo 1 to Echo 2. Form up
behind the Omega Starfury.'

06:53.375 --> 06:55.458
'We'll escort him to Babylon 5.'

07:02.750 --> 07:03.833
Commander.

07:03.917 --> 07:05.667
Look, G'Kar, I'm sorry
I missed our meeting

07:05.750 --> 07:07.208
but something very important
has come up.

07:07.292 --> 07:08.708
No, not a problem, commander.

07:08.792 --> 07:11.000
My patience is infinite.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.167
I've come to collect on a debt.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.083
When you broke from Earth,
I offered Sheridan

07:15.167 --> 07:16.958
the support
of all the local Narns.

07:17.042 --> 07:18.417
Since then we've helped maintain

07:18.500 --> 07:20.333
station security,
we've kept the peace.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.667
Many of us were killed during
the defense of Babylon 5.

07:22.750 --> 07:25.750
G'Kar, I know this and we're
very grateful, but I just--

07:25.833 --> 07:27.875
You've been putting together
a new alliance.

07:27.958 --> 07:29.083
You know it, I know it.

07:29.167 --> 07:31.583
So, in exchange
for my cooperation

07:31.667 --> 07:34.000
I told Sheridan
that I wanted in.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.625
He agreed or seemed to.

07:35.708 --> 07:37.875
I've been waiting for him
to keep his part of the bargain

07:37.958 --> 07:41.042
but nothing has happened,
so now I'm forcing the issue.

07:41.125 --> 07:43.167
We've been very busy, G'Kar.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.875
It does not show
any signs of getting

07:44.958 --> 07:47.042
any less busy
in the near future.

07:47.125 --> 07:48.375
I can only wait so long.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.667
I thought your patience
was infinite.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.583
Since space and time are curved

07:52.667 --> 07:55.250
the infinite sooner or later
bends back upon itself

07:55.333 --> 07:57.917
and ends up where it began,
and so have I.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.500
I've kept my part
of the bargain, commander.

08:00.583 --> 08:02.750
Now it is time for you to
keep yours.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.958
(female #1)
'Alpha 3 and 4'

08:08.042 --> 08:09.917
'the captain says you're clear
to bring him in.'

08:10.000 --> 08:12.542
[instrumental music]

08:12.625 --> 08:13.708
[door clanking]

08:37.875 --> 08:39.167
[Bester laughing]

08:40.792 --> 08:42.917
You know, if this keeps up

08:43.000 --> 08:45.917
I'm gonna start thinking
that people around here

08:46.000 --> 08:47.333
just don't like me.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.792
(Michael)
'I don't like it.'

08:52.875 --> 08:54.833
Well, I didn't even know
the little creep

08:54.917 --> 08:56.125
could fly a Starfury.

08:59.917 --> 09:01.333
[sighing]

09:01.417 --> 09:03.750
Every once in a while,
the Psi Corps have to go off

09:03.833 --> 09:06.458
on their own
for security reasons.

09:06.542 --> 09:09.625
He's checked out
on all the latest fighters.

09:09.708 --> 09:11.625
Did he tell you why is he here?

09:11.708 --> 09:14.875
He said he wanted to fill us
in at a personal meeting.

09:14.958 --> 09:17.500
He just wants to get close
enough to scan us.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.292
Yeah, but why?

09:19.375 --> 09:21.583
I mean, everything we were
planning to do, we've done.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.500
Hm?
We've broken away from Earth.

09:23.583 --> 09:26.625
We've taken a stand against
Psi Corps, the president.

09:26.708 --> 09:28.208
There's not much left
to scan for.

09:28.292 --> 09:29.958
He doesn't know that.

09:30.042 --> 09:31.708
Well, I could drug him up again.

09:31.792 --> 09:33.125
Limit his ability to scan us.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.625
He says if we do that,
he won't be able help us.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.625
Come on, I mean,
who in this room thinks

09:37.708 --> 09:39.292
he only wants anybody
but himself.

09:39.375 --> 09:40.958
He's trying to pull a fast one.

09:41.042 --> 09:43.000
So what do we do,
just keep him locked up forever?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.458
I can get behind that.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.250
We have to find out
if he's telling the truth.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.875
If he is,
we need to hear him out.

09:47.958 --> 09:50.833
If he's not,
I'm all for throw him into..

09:50.917 --> 09:52.417
No, under the brig.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.542
I need to speak to Ivanova
alone for a moment.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.000
Susan,
Bester still doesn't know

10:05.083 --> 10:07.292
you're a latent telepath.

10:07.375 --> 10:08.500
No, he doesn't, but..

10:13.125 --> 10:14.458
You're not gonna
do this to me, are you?

10:14.542 --> 10:16.708
If he's going to risk
scanning someone

10:16.792 --> 10:19.500
my guess is he'll grab the first
person that walks in the door.

10:19.583 --> 10:21.250
In case he doesn't get
another chance.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.000
John, I can't block a Psi Cop.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.167
No, but you told me
that you can sense instantly

10:25.250 --> 10:26.708
if someone is scanning you.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.708
If I send you in first
to talk to him..

10:30.125 --> 10:31.708
...you'll know
if he tries anything.

10:31.792 --> 10:34.750
If he doesn't try it,
we'll know we can trust him.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.167
A little.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.417
But if he does?

10:40.500 --> 10:42.042
Then we'll keep him
in the brig.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.208
For how long?

10:43.292 --> 10:45.583
Until we run out of food
or he dies of old age

10:45.667 --> 10:47.167
whichever comes first.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.917
- Okay.
- Now--

10:54.000 --> 10:56.417
Before you do that, there's
something you should know.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.083
We've got a problem with G'Kar.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.167
[door whirring]

11:11.917 --> 11:13.042
I was expecting the captain.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.083
- He sent me.
- Did he?

11:15.167 --> 11:18.417
He has a better sense of humor
than I thought.

11:18.500 --> 11:19.792
Please sit.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.208
I'd rather stand.

11:21.292 --> 11:23.917
I suspect you'd rather
walk out that door

11:24.000 --> 11:26.125
and wall me up inside.

11:26.208 --> 11:30.792
Do a little recreation
of "The Cask of Amontillado."

11:30.875 --> 11:33.542
For the love of God,
The Montressor.

11:33.625 --> 11:36.875
If you get near a point,
make it.

11:36.958 --> 11:39.000
You know when I first came
to Babylon 5

11:39.083 --> 11:40.625
I studied your record.

11:41.792 --> 11:44.167
Terrible pity about your mother.

11:44.250 --> 11:47.208
But, she took her own life.

11:47.292 --> 11:49.000
It wasn't the Corps that did it.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.208
I was just noticing..

11:51.292 --> 11:52.625
...you have her eyes.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.083
You know..

12:03.167 --> 12:06.000
It's come to my attention
lately that

12:06.083 --> 12:08.417
we have a common enemy.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.375
There's an old saying

12:10.458 --> 12:14.958
"The enemy of my enemy
is my friend."

12:15.042 --> 12:19.125
President Clark isn't calling
the shots back home.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.625
There are others
whispering in his ear.

12:20.708 --> 12:22.292
I don't know who they are
or where they're from

12:22.375 --> 12:24.333
but I do know they're not human.

12:25.500 --> 12:30.042
I've only heard one name
for them...Shadows.

12:30.125 --> 12:34.125
My guess is you know more
about them than I do.

12:34.208 --> 12:36.000
But you're probably
not interested

12:36.083 --> 12:38.000
in sharing that information.

12:39.042 --> 12:40.083
Are you?

12:41.917 --> 12:45.583
You know the real reason
you don't like me, commander?

12:45.667 --> 12:47.625
It's the jealousy of evolution.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.208
'Normals like you are obsolete.'

12:51.292 --> 12:54.000
The future belongs to telepaths.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.667
And I intend to make sure
that future happens

12:58.750 --> 13:00.417
one way or the other.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.500
So when the dust settles

13:01.583 --> 13:04.583
and telepaths
are running everything

13:04.667 --> 13:07.958
you'll be on top
of the new order.

13:08.042 --> 13:10.000
Well, let's just say
I have certain ambitions

13:10.083 --> 13:11.667
'and leave it at that.'

13:11.750 --> 13:15.375
But we can't be on top
if the aliens get there first.

13:15.458 --> 13:16.958
And some them have.

13:17.042 --> 13:19.500
Through Clark, they've
infiltrated the Psi Corps

13:19.583 --> 13:22.708
and apparently they have their
own plans for my telepaths.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.375
Whatever these aliens are

13:25.458 --> 13:28.333
my
plans for the future.

13:31.458 --> 13:32.667
I won't have it.

13:34.083 --> 13:38.125
And so, I need someone
who feels the same way I do.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.708
Which brings me to you.

13:41.792 --> 13:44.167
'Would you like to hurt them,
commander?'

13:44.250 --> 13:46.333
Because I think I know how..

13:47.125 --> 13:48.667
...if you're up for it.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.667
So, G'Kar's kept his promise.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.250
And he'll bail us out
of a real situation

13:58.333 --> 13:59.708
during our fight with Earth.

13:59.792 --> 14:03.792
He's proven he could be
a major asset to us.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.458
I just hoped to
postpone this a little.

14:06.542 --> 14:10.083
I know, he's been poking around
for some time now

14:10.167 --> 14:13.000
asking about rangers, our
meetings, the new war council.

14:13.083 --> 14:15.792
He was also first one
to warn me about the Shadows

14:15.875 --> 14:18.708
many months before
you said anything.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.917
I didn't want to hold back.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.792
But silence was necessary.

14:22.875 --> 14:25.208
We had to buy time
to build our defenses.

14:25.292 --> 14:28.750
The Centauri never could have
taken Narn without outside help.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.083
How are we gonna tell him

14:30.167 --> 14:33.250
that we were willing
to sacrifice his world

14:33.333 --> 14:34.542
to keep a secret?

14:37.708 --> 14:39.917
will not have to.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.125
- I will tell him.
- Oh, absolutely not.

14:42.208 --> 14:43.958
- It was my decision, John.
- Delenn, I'm..

14:44.042 --> 14:46.375
I held back the information
from you for months

14:46.458 --> 14:50.875
and it was Kosh and I who
insisted you tell no one else.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.625
The choice was mine

14:52.708 --> 14:54.208
and now the responsibility
is mine.

14:54.292 --> 14:55.625
Delenn, I'm not going to..

14:55.708 --> 14:58.458
[device beeping]
Yeah.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.042
(Susan)
'I've finished my meeting,
captain.'

15:00.125 --> 15:01.375
'Ready when you are.'

15:01.458 --> 15:02.625
I'll be right there.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.750
Are you sure
you want to do this?

15:04.833 --> 15:07.083
Want to? No.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.958
Have to? Yes.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.042
In a few hours,
a convoy of ships

15:12.125 --> 15:15.542
will be riding the hyperspace
beacon through Sector 500.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.125
At the center of the convoy
is a ship

15:17.208 --> 15:19.833
containing supplies
for our mutual enemy.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.500
The ship is being escorted
by approximately

15:23.583 --> 15:26.292
half a dozen enemy fighters.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.583
Seize the ship,
and we deprive them

15:28.667 --> 15:31.083
of some of their
weapons capability.

15:31.167 --> 15:35.667
But it's important to capture
the ship, not destroy it.

15:35.750 --> 15:38.792
So how did you find out
about all of this?

15:38.875 --> 15:40.917
I'm a telepath.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.500
Work it out.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.333
Okay, you've delivered
your message.

15:45.417 --> 15:47.333
What do we need you for now?

15:47.417 --> 15:49.375
Locating a ship this small
in hyperspace

15:49.458 --> 15:50.792
is extremely difficult.

15:50.875 --> 15:52.750
The gravitational incline,
competing beacons

15:52.833 --> 15:54.250
energy surges.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.875
You could search for days
and not find it.

15:55.958 --> 16:01.167
Unless you just happened to have
along a telepath rated P-12.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.042
Someone like myself.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.625
Trained P-12 can pinpoint
a ship's location

16:05.708 --> 16:08.750
by focusing in on the thought
waves of those aboard.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.000
For some reason, hyperspace

16:10.083 --> 16:11.833
amplifies the signal
considerably.

16:11.917 --> 16:15.500
So, how come I've never heard
of that little ability before?

16:15.583 --> 16:17.375
We kept it to ourselves.

16:17.458 --> 16:20.375
Otherwise, the military
might start putting telepaths

16:20.458 --> 16:22.667
on the front lines.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.792
We're not expendable.

16:24.875 --> 16:28.042
- Mundanes are.
- That would be us.

16:28.958 --> 16:32.125
Got it in one, Mr. Garibaldi.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.708
'It takes generations
to breed a telepath.'

16:34.792 --> 16:36.167
Mundanes breed like rabbits.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.542
Supply and demand.
Nothing more, nothing less.

16:39.750 --> 16:43.500
Captain,
we don't have a lot of time.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.125
'Without me,
you'll never find them.'

16:47.208 --> 16:48.250
So..

16:49.625 --> 16:51.083
Do we stay..

16:51.167 --> 16:52.208
...or do we go?

17:05.583 --> 17:06.667
[device beeping]

17:11.042 --> 17:12.083
Come in.

17:18.042 --> 17:19.333
Hello, G'Kar.

17:25.917 --> 17:28.958
[dramatic music]

17:49.750 --> 17:51.875
Try not to drool
on the controls.

17:53.792 --> 17:55.208
You said something, captain?

17:56.167 --> 17:58.458
Mm. Not a word.

17:58.542 --> 17:59.583
Just burped.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.542
Approaching target area.

18:02.625 --> 18:05.875
(Susan)
'The scanners
aren't picking anything up.'

18:05.958 --> 18:08.542
Alright, let's see
what you can do.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.500
Mr. Bester.

18:16.750 --> 18:17.833
Captain Sheridan.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.208
Get the hell out of my chair.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.917
They're here.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.083
I can feel them.

18:35.083 --> 18:36.167
Thirty degrees to port.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.042
Captain?

18:41.583 --> 18:43.125
Thirty degrees to port.

18:44.208 --> 18:47.333
[speaking in foreign language]

18:52.792 --> 18:54.833
[electricity crackling]

18:58.292 --> 19:01.083
And we knew that the Shadows..

19:01.167 --> 19:03.333
...the ancient enemy,
as you call them..

19:04.375 --> 19:05.458
...had returned.

19:07.875 --> 19:09.625
We knew they were
rebuilding their forces

19:09.708 --> 19:11.208
preparing to strike.

19:12.792 --> 19:15.083
We knew that they
were seeking allies

19:15.167 --> 19:17.625
and that the Centauri
were the first to enlist.

19:20.917 --> 19:24.208
When you came back
from the area near Z'ha'dum

19:24.292 --> 19:26.500
and warned us
about the enemy's return.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.667
We could have spoken out.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.875
We could have confirmed
your story.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.542
We chose to remain silent.

19:38.958 --> 19:40.708
Who is we?

19:40.792 --> 19:41.875
The Grey Council.

19:43.167 --> 19:45.750
I was still a part of them
at that time.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.958
'Once the decision was made
I could not disobey it.'

19:50.500 --> 19:52.042
So you stayed silent.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.208
And with the help
of these Shadows..

19:57.667 --> 19:59.875
...the Centauri
destroyed my world..

20:01.375 --> 20:04.208
...enslaved or killed
millions of my people.

20:05.458 --> 20:09.833
(Delenn)
'G'Kar...if we had spoken out'

20:09.917 --> 20:12.208
if we had gone public
with what we knew

20:12.292 --> 20:15.708
most of the other worlds
would never have believed us.

20:15.792 --> 20:18.625
nothing.

20:18.708 --> 20:21.792
'Your world
would still have fallen'

20:21.875 --> 20:23.917
with one critical difference.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.500
There are billions of Narns
still surviving on your world.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.125
If we had exposed the Shadows

20:30.208 --> 20:31.708
they would have struck openly

20:31.792 --> 20:33.667
before we had time to prepare

20:33.750 --> 20:36.750
and none of your people
would have survived.

20:39.542 --> 20:42.625
G'Kar...under the Centauri

20:42.708 --> 20:45.417
there is at least
the hope of survival.

20:46.667 --> 20:48.583
With the Shadows..

20:48.667 --> 20:50.083
...there is no hope at all.

20:52.208 --> 20:54.750
We had to choose between
the death of millions..

20:56.125 --> 20:58.833
...and the death of billions.

20:58.917 --> 21:00.417
Of whole planets.

21:08.792 --> 21:10.625
I'd already discovered

21:10.708 --> 21:13.833
much of what you just told me
about the Centauri.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.208
But that you knew
and said nothing.

21:20.833 --> 21:22.917
'Had I learned this
as my world'

21:23.000 --> 21:25.875
'was being bombed
by the Centauri'

21:25.958 --> 21:27.917
I would have killed you
instantly!

21:29.417 --> 21:31.375
You understand that,
do you not?

21:34.292 --> 21:36.542
Yes, I do.

21:54.708 --> 21:57.333
Some must be sacrificed..

21:57.417 --> 21:59.083
...if all are to be saved.

22:00.917 --> 22:04.375
At first, I took that as
revelation for the future.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.250
Now I see

22:08.333 --> 22:12.375
that it is as much
about how we got here

22:12.458 --> 22:14.250
as about where we are going.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.458
I think that one sentence..

22:20.917 --> 22:23.292
...is the greatest burden
I have ever known.

22:25.750 --> 22:26.833
'You're right.'

22:28.458 --> 22:29.958
Nothing would have been changed.

22:31.417 --> 22:35.292
Except that my people
would now be a dead race.

22:37.958 --> 22:41.167
You have come a long way, G'Kar.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.667
Further,
than I could have guessed.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.250
Sheridan's promise

22:49.333 --> 22:53.167
binds me as well as it does him.

22:53.250 --> 22:55.417
We will take you
into the council, G'Kar.

22:57.625 --> 22:58.708
And someday..

22:59.958 --> 23:01.500
...when all this is over..

23:03.083 --> 23:06.083
...perhaps you will find it
in your heart to forgive me.

23:06.917 --> 23:08.000
Perhaps..

23:10.542 --> 23:11.667
...but not today.

23:14.792 --> 23:15.875
[door whirring]

23:18.500 --> 23:20.542
[door whirring]

23:23.125 --> 23:25.167
[zapping]

23:26.542 --> 23:28.375
Locking weapons. Firing

23:29.208 --> 23:32.125
[zapping]

23:35.125 --> 23:36.542
Target has been eliminated.

23:36.625 --> 23:38.125
Where's the transport?

23:38.208 --> 23:40.958
- Moving to escape.
- Can we intercept?

23:41.042 --> 23:42.667
The White Star is powered
by a magnetic

23:42.750 --> 23:45.625
and gravitational system
like all Minbari cruisers.

23:45.708 --> 23:47.958
You can use a magnetic discharge
to capture the escaping..

23:48.042 --> 23:50.792
A simple yes or no would have
sufficed, Mr. Lennier.

23:50.875 --> 23:51.958
Grab it.

23:54.250 --> 23:57.292
[zapping]

24:01.792 --> 24:04.708
Captain, I'm picking up
another ship.

24:04.792 --> 24:06.000
'It's a Shadow Vessel.'

24:06.083 --> 24:07.667
Probably the mother ship
for the fighters.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.833
- Standby to--
- 'Just a moment.'

24:09.917 --> 24:11.000
It's breaking off.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.000
It's not attacking.

24:15.750 --> 24:18.792
[electricity crackling]

24:22.875 --> 24:26.167
That's strange.
Why, why didn't they attack?

24:26.250 --> 24:27.917
They must know we're here.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.458
Unknown. We could pursue it
and attempt to inquire.

24:32.542 --> 24:35.375
Thanks. No, no. I'm just as
happy to get out of here

24:35.458 --> 24:36.583
without another fight.

24:37.667 --> 24:38.875
Set course for home.

24:40.458 --> 24:41.542
Are you sure you don't know

24:41.625 --> 24:43.875
what's inside that ship,
Mr. Bester?

24:45.375 --> 24:46.625
Weapon supplies.

24:47.875 --> 24:49.792
That's what I was told.

24:52.583 --> 24:54.042
[whooshing]

24:54.125 --> 24:55.625
[electricity crackling]

24:59.958 --> 25:03.083
[instrumental music]

25:18.708 --> 25:20.458
Got your message. What's up?

25:20.542 --> 25:22.792
I want you to take a look at
this. Tell me what you think.

25:28.250 --> 25:30.250
It's the pilot of the transport
we brought in.

25:31.375 --> 25:32.500
What's left of him.

25:33.750 --> 25:36.125
What happened to him...it?

25:36.208 --> 25:39.042
That's what we're trying
to figure out. Best guess..

25:39.125 --> 25:41.458
It took its own life
rather than be captured.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.542
We found some kind
of acid compound

25:43.625 --> 25:45.542
all over the command deck.

25:45.625 --> 25:46.958
It's hard to tell
from what's left.

25:47.042 --> 25:48.125
Yeah.

25:48.208 --> 25:50.167
I've never seen anything
quite like it before.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.208
Ohh!

25:51.292 --> 25:52.458
[exhaling]

25:52.542 --> 25:54.750
I'll do a full autopsy,
archive the body.

25:54.833 --> 25:57.625
You never know when we may see
something like this again.

25:57.708 --> 26:00.333
Captain, we just finished
burning through the cargo hold.

26:00.417 --> 26:02.250
We're emptying the contents now.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.542
Was Bester right?
Were there weapons aboard?

26:04.625 --> 26:06.208
That depends
how you define weapons.

26:18.958 --> 26:20.083
(John)
'Psi Corps.'

26:21.000 --> 26:22.792
These are telepaths.

26:22.875 --> 26:24.125
That would be my guess.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.167
We found about a hundred
of them in sleeper tubes.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.833
'From the look on
some of their faces'

26:28.917 --> 26:31.083
'I don't think
they went voluntarily.'

26:33.583 --> 26:35.375
You knew there were telepaths
aboard on that ship

26:35.458 --> 26:38.167
and you didn't tell us, why?

26:38.250 --> 26:42.042
Your crew here isn't exactly
sympathetic to the Psi Corps.

26:42.125 --> 26:44.000
'I assumed that since
those at risk'

26:44.083 --> 26:45.333
'were members of the Corps'

26:45.417 --> 26:46.875
'you wouldn't be interested
in helping.'

26:46.958 --> 26:50.667
You told us there were
weapon systems aboard that ship.

26:50.750 --> 26:52.333
That's what I was told.

26:52.417 --> 26:53.958
I didn't find out about our
people being aboard

26:54.708 --> 26:56.667
until much later.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.833
May I ask where they are?

26:58.917 --> 27:00.875
Medlab 1.

27:00.958 --> 27:04.167
Dr. Franklin is taking one
out of cryogenic suspension

27:04.250 --> 27:06.333
to see if we can
find out what happened.

27:06.417 --> 27:10.083
And why someone would describe
a bunch of unconscious telepaths

27:10.167 --> 27:12.792
as components of a weapons
system.

27:12.875 --> 27:14.458
Computer, continue recording.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.833
I've gone over the cryotubes.

27:17.917 --> 27:20.208
I can't find any indication
of who made them

27:20.292 --> 27:22.708
or where they came from.

27:22.792 --> 27:25.542
Raising the temperature
slowly to avoid trauma.

27:28.875 --> 27:33.083
The only ID
on the body is a bracelet.

27:33.167 --> 27:36.833
'I can see a Psi Corps logo
and a sequence of numbers.'

27:38.208 --> 27:39.875
I suspect our friend Mr. Bester

27:39.958 --> 27:43.250
might have some ideas
about what this is.

27:43.333 --> 27:45.375
'Hard to tell without
doing a more detailed scan'

27:45.458 --> 27:48.000
'but there appear to be
cyber-web implants in the skull'

27:48.083 --> 27:50.458
'on either side of
the cerebral cortex.'

27:52.375 --> 27:55.542
There are small
metallic interfaces

27:55.625 --> 27:57.000
on either side of the head

27:57.083 --> 28:00.958
just above the temple.
I can almost see--

28:01.042 --> 28:02.958
Get me out of here!

28:03.042 --> 28:04.542
Keep them away from me!

28:04.625 --> 28:06.083
[whooshing]

28:06.167 --> 28:09.208
Leave me alone.
Why are you doing this to me?

28:09.292 --> 28:10.917
- It's gonna be okay.
- No!

28:11.000 --> 28:12.583
Ahh!

28:12.667 --> 28:15.125
(Franklin)
'Someone's definitely
messed with her wetware.'

28:15.208 --> 28:17.917
Technology is way beyond
anything we've got.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.083
The only clue we have is this.

28:23.458 --> 28:25.083
You ever seen one of these
before?

28:30.167 --> 28:31.708
Frequently.

28:31.792 --> 28:33.042
She's a blip.

28:33.125 --> 28:34.750
A telepath who refused
to join the Corps

28:34.833 --> 28:37.000
or take the sleepers
to control their ability.

28:38.208 --> 28:40.375
[chuckling softly]
Sometimes they run.

28:41.583 --> 28:43.167
She ran, and..

28:44.583 --> 28:46.125
...one of us caught her.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.375
We always do.

28:48.458 --> 28:50.333
The code indicates
that after being captured

28:50.417 --> 28:53.458
she was sent to the re-education
facility on Mars.

28:54.792 --> 28:56.000
From the serial number

28:56.083 --> 29:00.083
she was classified
as either P-11 or P-12.

29:00.167 --> 29:02.750
Very high on the teep scale.
She..

29:05.917 --> 29:09.583
What was she doing on an alien
transport bound for the rim?

29:15.208 --> 29:16.292
I said..

29:18.750 --> 29:21.000
I need to see her.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.667
She'll be out for at least
another several hours.

29:25.167 --> 29:26.917
Too long.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.917
I have to see her...now.

29:32.792 --> 29:33.875
[gasping]

29:34.625 --> 29:37.708
[instrumental music]

29:56.542 --> 29:59.583
[screaming]

30:08.417 --> 30:11.458
[alarm blaring]

30:14.417 --> 30:16.667
- Hey, where is she?
- Inside.

30:16.750 --> 30:18.042
You don't want to go in there.

30:19.792 --> 30:22.625
[electricity crackling]

30:22.708 --> 30:25.750
[alarm blaring]

30:38.042 --> 30:39.167
[electricity crackling]

30:48.625 --> 30:51.667
[dramatic music]

31:13.000 --> 31:15.833
[electricity crackling]

31:15.917 --> 31:17.000
Stephen.

31:17.708 --> 31:19.167
No, let me try.

31:20.833 --> 31:21.917
It's alright.

31:23.167 --> 31:25.292
'No one's gonna hurt you,
alright?'

31:25.375 --> 31:26.958
'You've been through
a rough time'

31:27.042 --> 31:28.625
some things
have happened to you.

31:28.708 --> 31:31.208
I know they've been traumatic,
but you're gonna be okay.

31:31.292 --> 31:33.083
[electricity crackling]

31:33.167 --> 31:34.208
Al..

31:35.875 --> 31:36.917
'Alfred?'

31:38.375 --> 31:39.500
Help me.

31:43.375 --> 31:44.958
(Michael)
'Look out!'

31:45.042 --> 31:46.125
[electricity crackling]

31:49.583 --> 31:50.750
[electricity crackling]

31:50.833 --> 31:51.917
Stephen, don't.

31:56.542 --> 31:57.708
(Stephen)
'Look, I'm a doctor.'

31:59.167 --> 32:01.000
'I want to help you.'

32:01.083 --> 32:03.125
But you got to
let us get to you.

32:04.250 --> 32:05.833
Pain..

32:05.917 --> 32:08.917
We can stop the pain. Give us
a chance to stop the pain.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.208
Aah!

32:10.292 --> 32:11.667
[electricity crackling]

32:11.750 --> 32:13.500
- Yeah?
- 'Chief.'

32:13.583 --> 32:16.000
(male #2)
'We're getting a serious
energy surge from Medlab 1.'

32:16.083 --> 32:19.250
'Losing control over several
automatic systems.'

32:19.333 --> 32:20.625
Alright, reroute command
authorizations.

32:20.708 --> 32:24.000
Shut down the system
links to Medlab. Stand by.

32:24.083 --> 32:25.167
She must be using
those connections

32:25.250 --> 32:27.000
to infiltrate
the rest of the station.

32:27.083 --> 32:31.000
There's no reason for her
to do this or attack me.

32:31.083 --> 32:34.042
- Why is she doing this?
- It's a good question.

32:34.125 --> 32:36.083
She wasn't going to until..

32:36.167 --> 32:37.208
...until..

32:38.167 --> 32:39.250
Give me that.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.958
Stephen, back off a second.

32:46.458 --> 32:47.542
[electricity crackling]

32:49.792 --> 32:50.917
[electricity crackling]

32:56.625 --> 32:58.542
The machine says kill..

32:59.917 --> 33:01.000
...to protect.

33:02.667 --> 33:04.667
'The sign hurts us.'

33:04.750 --> 33:07.208
We cannot hear the machine.

33:07.292 --> 33:08.875
What machine?

33:08.958 --> 33:11.000
Alive..

33:11.875 --> 33:13.375
...in my mind.

33:14.292 --> 33:15.792
I am the machine.

33:17.083 --> 33:18.167
'We join..'

33:19.417 --> 33:20.500
'...we fight.'

33:22.625 --> 33:24.167
It is dark..

33:25.292 --> 33:27.042
...terrible.

33:27.125 --> 33:28.208
[electricity crackling]

33:29.458 --> 33:31.542
Help me.

33:31.625 --> 33:36.583
Please, make it stop talking
in my mind.

33:36.667 --> 33:37.750
I will.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.042
[electricity crackling]

33:41.458 --> 33:42.500
[groaning]

33:44.958 --> 33:46.000
Oh, God.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.625
Al..

33:48.708 --> 33:50.833
'What have they done to me?'

33:51.625 --> 33:52.708
What have they..

33:55.750 --> 33:58.792
[dramatic music]

34:08.208 --> 34:09.417
[sighing]

34:09.500 --> 34:10.625
(Michael)
'Bester?'

34:12.417 --> 34:13.542
'Bester, what happened?'

34:14.583 --> 34:15.542
'Be.. What did you see?'

34:15.625 --> 34:16.750
[electricity crackling]

34:21.833 --> 34:24.917
(John)
Garibaldi said
she called you by name.

34:26.042 --> 34:27.583
You two know each other?

34:28.875 --> 34:30.750
I recognized her ID.

34:31.750 --> 34:32.958
I didn't believe it.

34:34.708 --> 34:35.833
I didn't think..

34:36.500 --> 34:37.583
Who is she?

34:38.875 --> 34:42.875
The single bright light
of my existence.

34:44.708 --> 34:45.750
My lover.

34:48.417 --> 34:51.167
She's carrying my child.

34:51.250 --> 34:53.833
I thought you had a wife
and daughter back on Mars.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.000
I do.

34:56.208 --> 34:59.208
It was a genetic pairing
arranged by the Corps.

35:01.083 --> 35:02.625
There's no love there.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.083
But Carolyn..

35:13.083 --> 35:15.500
...she was supposed to
be just another blip

35:15.583 --> 35:17.708
assigned to
the re-education center.

35:21.208 --> 35:23.167
The moment I saw her..

35:23.250 --> 35:25.042
...I felt as though something
long dead

35:25.125 --> 35:26.667
had awakened inside me.

35:29.125 --> 35:32.167
I used every excuse I could
to spend time with her.

35:32.250 --> 35:34.667
I helped her get better
quarters, more food..

35:35.625 --> 35:37.375
'I did whatever I could'

35:37.458 --> 35:39.583
to make her life
a little more bearable.

35:40.958 --> 35:42.917
Somewhere along the line..

35:47.292 --> 35:48.625
...somewhere along the line

35:48.708 --> 35:50.500
I discovered
I was in love with her.

35:52.625 --> 35:54.208
I hadn't thought it possible.

35:55.917 --> 35:57.542
I don't think

35:57.625 --> 36:00.000
I'd ever been in love before.

36:00.083 --> 36:02.333
Well, if that's true,
then why didn't you get her out?

36:02.417 --> 36:05.833
Because I don't have
that kind of authority.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.917
When I found out she was
pregnant with our child

36:10.000 --> 36:12.917
I kept after her to go on the
sleepers or join the Corps.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.083
We could be together that way.

36:18.167 --> 36:19.833
[takes deep breath]

36:19.917 --> 36:21.042
She refused.

36:22.333 --> 36:23.875
She was always stubborn.

36:25.333 --> 36:27.208
That was four weeks ago.

36:27.292 --> 36:31.042
What did you see inside her mind
before she passed out?

36:31.125 --> 36:33.292
Those things.

36:33.375 --> 36:36.125
Those Shadow Vessels.

36:37.292 --> 36:39.417
How much do you
know about them?

36:39.500 --> 36:42.458
Delenn said they're some kind
of organic technology

36:42.542 --> 36:44.167
and they use
living beings as..

36:45.792 --> 36:47.792
...as their central
operating system.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.583
That's it, isn't it?

36:51.667 --> 36:53.833
They were gonna plug
those people into their ships.

36:56.042 --> 36:57.750
Weapons components.

36:58.708 --> 37:00.542
My God.

37:00.625 --> 37:02.042
That's how she was able
to interface

37:02.125 --> 37:03.500
with all the equipment
in Medlab.

37:03.583 --> 37:05.958
She was going to
merge with the station.

37:06.042 --> 37:08.917
But why telepaths? Delenn never
said that was a requirement.

37:09.792 --> 37:10.875
Can you help her?

37:11.708 --> 37:13.500
I don't know.

37:13.583 --> 37:15.750
I mean, the technology
that's plugged into her brain

37:15.833 --> 37:18.250
is beyond anything
we've seen before.

37:23.042 --> 37:26.208
I'll wait,
however long it takes.

37:26.292 --> 37:28.458
She's the only thing I have,
captain.

37:29.375 --> 37:32.375
The only thing I care about.

37:32.458 --> 37:36.042
I promised her I would take care
of her and the baby.

37:36.125 --> 37:38.500
It's the only promise
I ever made.

37:38.583 --> 37:40.083
That means a damn to me.

37:41.208 --> 37:43.667
If you can save her..

37:43.750 --> 37:46.542
...I'll do anything you want
to help.

37:49.750 --> 37:50.833
Your war..

37:54.083 --> 37:55.583
...is now my war.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.292
[door whirring]

38:03.833 --> 38:05.542
You have picked
a most auspicious day

38:05.625 --> 38:07.583
to join the war council, G'Kar.

38:07.667 --> 38:10.792
The captain tells me that a new
ally has joined our cause today

38:10.875 --> 38:13.833
and that our new facilities
are complete.

38:13.917 --> 38:17.167
Ours has been a long
and difficult road, G'Kar.

38:17.250 --> 38:18.500
Filled with mistrust.

38:19.792 --> 38:22.375
Once you step
through this door

38:22.458 --> 38:24.208
all of that changes..

38:24.292 --> 38:25.333
...forever.

38:25.417 --> 38:27.083
[door whirring]

38:27.167 --> 38:30.250
[instrumental music]

38:35.125 --> 38:36.208
[door whirring]

38:44.625 --> 38:46.542
I am honored to be among you.

38:48.167 --> 38:49.500
This is a great day..

38:51.417 --> 38:53.167
'...a very great day indeed.'

39:00.375 --> 39:02.917
(Susan)
'"The enemy of my enemy
is my friend."'

39:03.000 --> 39:04.375
You sound dubious.

39:04.458 --> 39:07.583
He's still a Psi Cop.
I don't trust him, never will.

39:07.667 --> 39:09.250
He's a vested interest
in helping us for now.

39:09.333 --> 39:12.792
But once this is all over,
he'll turn on us.

39:12.875 --> 39:13.958
You do know that?

39:17.167 --> 39:19.458
Come on. Come on, where is it?

39:20.792 --> 39:22.375
A book this important

39:22.458 --> 39:25.208
you would think
it would have an index.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.167
[sighing]
Oh, man.

39:31.042 --> 39:32.083
Aha!

39:35.000 --> 39:36.083
Okay.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.833
[speaking in foreign language]

39:42.417 --> 39:43.500
"Mind walker."

39:47.875 --> 39:50.250
[speaking in foreign language]

39:52.125 --> 39:53.208
"Destroyed."

39:56.458 --> 39:57.542
I was right.

39:59.167 --> 40:00.833
- Garibaldi to Sheridan.
- 'Sheridan, go.'

40:00.917 --> 40:02.375
Code 7-R, 15 minutes.

40:02.458 --> 40:03.833
(John)
'I'm kind of in the middle
of something.'

40:03.917 --> 40:05.500
Make time. You gonna love this.

40:22.708 --> 40:25.542
Hello, hello, hello,
and...hello.

40:27.042 --> 40:29.042
Michael, you look like
the proverbial cat

40:29.125 --> 40:31.125
that ate the equally
proverbial canary.

40:32.667 --> 40:35.500
I've got it.
I've got it. I've got it.

40:35.583 --> 40:37.667
It's right here.
It's right, right here.

40:37.750 --> 40:41.208
Do not thump the Book of G'Quan.
I-it's disrespectful.

40:41.292 --> 40:43.208
You've got what?
What's in there?

40:43.292 --> 40:45.750
G'Kar, as I understand it..

40:45.833 --> 40:47.875
...there aren't any Narn
telepaths, correct?

40:47.958 --> 40:49.167
Yes. I'm afraid it is so.

40:49.250 --> 40:51.417
It's a matter
of great concern to us.

40:51.500 --> 40:54.583
But once upon a time, there were
Narn telepaths, weren't there?

40:54.667 --> 40:58.167
Yes, but they and their families
were wiped out 1,000 years ago.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.667
The gene that controls
telepathy has never been

41:00.750 --> 41:03.667
strong enough in any of the
survivors to breed another one.

41:03.750 --> 41:05.708
Mr. Garibaldi,
I'm not entirely sure

41:05.792 --> 41:07.208
I see the point in all this.

41:07.292 --> 41:09.875
A 1000 years ago, ambassador.

41:09.958 --> 41:12.875
You said the last time
the Shadows were on the move

41:12.958 --> 41:14.833
was a 1000 years ago.

41:14.917 --> 41:16.875
G'Kar, it says here
that your world

41:16.958 --> 41:19.458
was used as a base by the
ancient enemy during that time.

41:19.542 --> 41:22.625
- Yes, that is correct.
- Alright.

41:22.708 --> 41:24.542
Read this, right here.

41:25.958 --> 41:29.583
"And the spirit of darkness
moved upon the land.

41:29.667 --> 41:33.208
"It screamed in the dreams
of the Mindwalkers

41:33.292 --> 41:35.542
"and they fell, destroyed by it

41:35.625 --> 41:39.208
"to their children
and their children's children.

41:39.292 --> 41:41.875
"Then did the darkness
come to Narn

41:41.958 --> 41:44.583
"until it was
driven out by G'Quan

41:44.667 --> 41:48.042
and the last of
the surviving Mindwalkers."

41:48.125 --> 41:49.708
Mind-walkers?

41:49.792 --> 41:50.875
Telepaths?

41:52.125 --> 41:54.125
They're afraid of telepaths.

41:54.208 --> 41:57.458
Carolyn fired at Bester's
Psi Corps insignia.

41:57.542 --> 42:00.417
"To protect.
The sign hurts us.

42:00.500 --> 42:02.875
We cannot hear the machine."

42:02.958 --> 42:05.583
They're using humans
to control their ships.

42:05.667 --> 42:08.208
Maybe telepaths can block
their system, jam it.

42:08.292 --> 42:09.708
He might be right.

42:09.792 --> 42:12.250
We've never seen the Shadows
back away from a fight.

42:12.333 --> 42:15.000
But they didn't attack the White
Star when we were right there.

42:15.083 --> 42:18.000
Why?
What was different about it?

42:18.083 --> 42:19.417
Bester was on board.

42:19.500 --> 42:21.083
That would explain
their decision

42:21.167 --> 42:22.542
to infiltrate your Psi Corps

42:22.625 --> 42:24.792
and take telepaths
as components for their ships.

42:24.875 --> 42:28.208
Perhaps they intend to use
one telepath to stop another.

42:29.542 --> 42:31.500
We have a weapon.

42:31.583 --> 42:34.167
My God, people,
we have a weapon.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.167
(Susan)
'I just hope it's in time.'

42:36.250 --> 42:37.417
''Cause we're gonna need it.'

42:39.083 --> 42:41.500
We just got a report.

42:41.583 --> 42:46.125
The Shadows have just started
attacking Brakiri Space, openly.

42:46.208 --> 42:47.333
They're not hiding anymore.

42:48.375 --> 42:49.958
'They're finally on the move.'

42:50.583 --> 42:53.625
[dramatic music]

43:05.208 --> 43:07.667
[theme music]

43:34.625 --> 43:37.708
[music continues]
