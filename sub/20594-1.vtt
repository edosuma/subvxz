24:25.700 --> 24:28.200
POLICE FEEL CERTAIN THAT

24:48.700 --> 24:53.200
SIGHTINGS OF THE MISSING WOMAN,
ELAINE MEYER, PICTURED HERE.

25:33.100 --> 25:37.800
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO
WATCH THE NEWS AT HOME.

25:37.800 --> 25:41.500
SOME THINGS CHILDREN SHOULDN'T SEE.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.100
THAT'S WHAT MY MOM SAYS...

25:45.200 --> 25:48.900

25:49.100 --> 25:52.600
I'M SO SORRY, STEPHANIE.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.500
OH.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.600
THAT POOR LITTLE GIRL...

26:02.700 --> 26:06.200

26:06.000 --> 26:11.400
I THINK IT'S A SHAME MAKIN G

NO, NO, HE'S RUSHING THOSE BUT
HE SAID IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE

27:10.800 --> 27:12.900
HIM A LONG TIME TO COLLECT IT ALL.

27:12.800 --> 27:16.300
DID HE SAY WHAT HE'S COLLECTING?

27:16.400 --> 27:18.700
I MEAN, DID HE MENTION...

27:18.800 --> 27:20.500
BALLISTICS?

27:20.400 --> 27:23.400
NO. BUT YOU KNOW HE IS
BIG ON HAIR AND FIBERS.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.200
IT'S KIND OF HIS...SPECIALTY.

27:25.100 --> 27:27.200
APPARENTLY THEY LEFT A LOT OF THAT.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.600
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WONDERING?

27:28.500 --> 27:32.000
WHY WOULD THEY BE SO SLOPPY?

27:31.900 --> 27:35.600
THEY'RE LIKELY TO IMPROVE.

27:35.400 --> 27:39.100
OH. OF COURSE. YEAH.

27:41.200 --> 27:44.400
UNLESS, MA'AM...

29:50.900 --> 29:52.500
PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT BUT JACK THERE;

29:52.700 --> 29:55.300

29:55.200 --> 29:56.600
UH, WE HEARD SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT ON THE RADIO...

29:56.700 --> 29:59.000

NO. NO. NO. RELAX,
KEITH. THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.600
YOU'RE 'PREACHING TO THE
CHOIR'. THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.100
IT WAS JUST A NORMAL SPEED, I
WAS GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND HAD

30:17.400 --> 30:18.800
A TIRE BLOW OUT, I'M NOT...

30:18.900 --> 30:20.300
YEAH, I KNOW. I TOLD HIM. AN

30:20.400 --> 30:24.200
HERE HE COMES... ACT CASUAL.

30:28.300 --> 30:30.700
GET DOWN ON THE FUCKING GROUND.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.100
OH. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA... MA'AM!

30:40.000 --> 30:40.900
PLEASE RETURN TO THE VEHICLE.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.100
KEITH, HONEY...?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.100

I'LL BE IN THE CAR, HONEY....

30:44.200 --> 30:45.600

30:47.400 --> 30:49.200
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GET YOUR WALLET

30:49.400 --> 30:50.800
AND GIVE IT TO MY PARTNER.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.000
KEITH, IT'S BEST TO DO WHAT HE SAYS,

30:53.100 --> 30:56.200
BECAUSE WHEN HE GETS LIKE
THIS...IT'S JUST REALLY CRUCIAL

30:56.100 --> 30:58.000
THAT HE FEELS LIKE YOU'RE LISTENING.

30:57.900 --> 31:00.900
I'M LISTENING.... PLEASE
DON'T SHOOT ME, OFFICER!

31:00.800 --> 31:04.300
WE LET HIM GO WITH A WARNING...

31:09.300 --> 31:13.000
(Gunshots)

31:16.000 --> 31:18.800
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE
GET OUT HERE, CAPTAIN...

31:18.900 --> 31:20.800
YEAH.

31:20.700 --> 31:24.600
THE WAY THEY START DRIVING
IN THE DESOLATE STRETCHES...

31:24.800 --> 31:29.000
LIKE THE RACECAR DRIVERS
THEY ALWAYS WANTED TO BE.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.600
SPEEDING IS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE
OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES, YOU KNOW.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.600
NOT THIS WEEK.

31:39.100 --> 31:43.800
I'LL BE, UH, GETTIN' BACK TO IT NOW.

31:43.800 --> 31:48.300
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT PLAN, WRIGHT.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.200
YOU GETTIN' COFFEE?

31:50.100 --> 31:54.300

32:47.800 --> 32:50.600

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
I THINK MAKING HIM ANGRY
IS A REALLY BAD IDEA.

32:55.900 --> 32:59.900
OH, GEE MOM....TELL DAD
I'M REAL FUCKIN' SORRY.
