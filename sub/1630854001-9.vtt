WEBVTT

00:44.122 --> 00:45.591
Viktor.

00:46.527 --> 00:48.597
Viktor.

00:51.036 --> 00:51.971
Wake up, Viktor.

00:53.907 --> 00:56.179
You were having a nightmare.

00:56.246 --> 00:59.018
Didn't you read my book?

00:59.085 --> 01:02.458
I said not to wake
the person up.

02:14.401 --> 02:18.109
Sharper than it looks.

02:18.176 --> 02:20.849
I mean, a little.

02:20.915 --> 02:23.186
Good.

02:23.252 --> 02:24.890
And it's perfectly normal

02:24.956 --> 02:28.864
to want to kill a patient that's
leaving therapy prematurely.

02:33.607 --> 02:36.212
Your dream.

02:41.222 --> 02:43.493
Auschwitz.

02:43.561 --> 02:46.533
Viktor Frankl is lying there,
having a nightmare.

02:46.600 --> 02:51.576
Remember what he said not
to do, in his book?

02:51.643 --> 02:53.781
Reality is worse
than a nightmare

02:53.848 --> 02:57.722
when you're in Auschwitz--
don't wake him up.

02:57.789 --> 02:59.759
I woke him up.

03:04.334 --> 03:07.942
Maybe the dream
is trying to say...

03:08.009 --> 03:10.881
the human spirit can prevail.

03:10.948 --> 03:12.451
You should keep working,

03:12.519 --> 03:14.255
keep being a therapist,
no matter what.

03:14.321 --> 03:16.158
How's it saying that?

03:16.225 --> 03:20.000
I don't know.
That's in his book.

03:20.066 --> 03:24.576
Or maybe it's telling me,
don't die like a fucking sheep.

03:55.938 --> 03:58.309
Sam!

04:01.182 --> 04:03.453
:
Sam!

04:05.391 --> 04:07.328
I know it's early.

04:07.394 --> 04:10.433
I'm sorry to wake you up,
but there's some things

04:10.501 --> 04:12.572
that we need to discuss.

04:20.822 --> 04:23.861
We need to talk
before you go to work.

04:23.928 --> 04:26.533
Please sit.

04:33.715 --> 04:36.921
I don't think that you should go
to see a new therapist.

04:37.889 --> 04:40.961
Sometimes it's true, a patient
needs to try somebody else.

04:41.028 --> 04:44.736
But sometimes it is a way
of running away.

04:44.803 --> 04:45.971
And I think that

04:46.038 --> 04:47.676
is what is happening here.

04:47.742 --> 04:50.815
And I think we're making
real progress.

04:50.881 --> 04:55.357
You are opening up more
than you ever did before.

04:55.424 --> 04:58.329
You are trying
to contain your impulses,

04:58.396 --> 05:03.239
even if we haven't found
anything that works yet.

05:03.306 --> 05:05.612
I know things are getting
worse right now.

05:05.678 --> 05:08.316
It's part of the process.

05:08.383 --> 05:10.588
It's where the clichÃ©
comes from,

05:10.655 --> 05:13.660
things get worse
before they get better.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.233
I've come to care
about you, Sam,

05:17.300 --> 05:19.673
as I always do
with my patients.

05:19.740 --> 05:23.079
You and I have developed
a relationship.

05:23.146 --> 05:26.520
No matter how strange
the situation is,

05:26.587 --> 05:28.056
that's the bottom line.

05:28.123 --> 05:32.966
Therapists and patients develop
genuine feelings.

05:33.033 --> 05:37.274
I know there are feelings, but...

05:41.215 --> 05:42.885
I told you, it's not working.

05:42.952 --> 05:46.492
And I'm going to see
Mr. Buchella next week.

05:46.559 --> 05:49.098
That still gives us a week.

05:49.165 --> 05:52.104
Let's see what we can
accomplish, hmm?

05:52.171 --> 05:56.279
At least send you off to him
in the best shape we can.

05:56.345 --> 05:59.619
I know what you're trying to do.

05:59.686 --> 06:03.661
Of course, I'm a human being.

06:03.727 --> 06:05.931
I don't want you to get
another therapist

06:05.998 --> 06:07.133
and then kill me.

06:08.937 --> 06:11.308
Sam, you can leave this room
at any time,

06:11.375 --> 06:12.846
you are not chained
to the floor,

06:12.912 --> 06:14.849
but I have some things
to say.

06:16.586 --> 06:20.193
I am going to tell you
about a man named Viktor Frankl.

06:20.260 --> 06:24.569
He was a psychiatrist in Austria
in the 1930s and '40s.

06:24.636 --> 06:26.873
He survived the Nazi
concentration camps,

06:26.940 --> 06:31.583
and he wrote a book called
<i>Man's Search for Meaning.</i>

06:31.650 --> 06:33.988
And his main point is that

06:34.054 --> 06:37.562
people need meaning
in their lives,

06:37.629 --> 06:40.735
probably more
than anything else.

06:40.801 --> 06:45.678
And I think that is a way
for you to take your next step.

06:45.745 --> 06:50.019
So, the deepest place
that we can find meaning

06:50.086 --> 06:52.958
is in relationships.

06:53.025 --> 06:58.336
We all need friends and romance,
people to be close to.

06:58.402 --> 07:00.642
For everyone,
that's what fills us up.

07:00.708 --> 07:03.547
That's what makes life
good to live.

07:03.614 --> 07:07.989
And without it,
anyone can go to dark places.

07:11.730 --> 07:13.066
So, like Mary.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.604
Yes, like Mary.

07:18.410 --> 07:22.384
When I was with her,
I didn't feel any different.

07:22.450 --> 07:25.123
I understand,
but you're changing now.

07:25.189 --> 07:27.796
If you had a girlfriend now,

07:27.862 --> 07:29.900
I bet it would be different.

07:29.966 --> 07:32.805
For some reason, I'm just,
I'm not...

07:32.872 --> 07:35.143
I'm not great at meeting women.

07:36.278 --> 07:37.782
How did you meet Mary?

07:38.818 --> 07:41.456
We went to high school together.

07:41.523 --> 07:45.230
We were, like, friends, kind of.

07:45.297 --> 07:49.405
And then my mom went to her
for physical therapy

07:49.471 --> 07:51.710
when she broke her wrist,

07:51.776 --> 07:54.983
and Mom gave her my number.

07:55.050 --> 07:57.154
That's good.

07:57.221 --> 08:00.026
Obviously, when she called,
you handled it well.

08:00.093 --> 08:02.698
Maybe you're better with women
than you think.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.338
What attracted you to Mary?

08:12.050 --> 08:15.524
I, I-- can we not talk
about Mary, please?

08:15.591 --> 08:18.697
Why?

08:29.719 --> 08:32.826
She didn't want
the marriage to end.

08:32.892 --> 08:36.432
But she didn't know
if I loved her.

08:36.499 --> 08:38.970
<i>Loved</i> loved her.

08:42.010 --> 08:44.650
Maybe I could get
some meaning from Hara.

08:44.716 --> 08:46.553
Our kid in Bangladesh.

08:46.619 --> 08:49.191
Mary and me would lie in bed

08:49.257 --> 08:52.532
sometimes and she would pretend
that we were all together.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.135
Us and Hara.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.640
Mm-hmm, that sounds nice.

08:56.707 --> 08:59.444
But then, other times,
if she didn't understand

08:59.512 --> 09:02.284
or agree with something that
I was trying to say to her,

09:02.351 --> 09:05.991
she would... get really upset.

09:07.093 --> 09:12.638
She... did I tell you she
complained all the time?

09:12.705 --> 09:14.976
She wasn't...

09:15.712 --> 09:17.882
Wasn't what?

09:18.651 --> 09:20.921
I don't know.

09:23.527 --> 09:26.800
Maybe she didn't have
enough meaning in her life.

09:30.306 --> 09:32.545
I wish I could meet her.

09:32.612 --> 09:34.081
Why?

09:34.147 --> 09:36.853
If I could see
the two of you together,

09:36.920 --> 09:39.859
I could help figure out

09:39.926 --> 09:42.164
if this is the right direction
for you to go in.

09:42.230 --> 09:45.771
Therapists can figure out what
two people go best together?

09:45.838 --> 09:48.176
It's hard to predict
what couples will work.

09:48.243 --> 09:51.683
But sometimes we can make
a pretty good guess

09:51.749 --> 09:52.918
about what won't work.

09:52.985 --> 09:54.856
Mm.

09:54.923 --> 09:57.828
This is going to sound
kind of strange.

09:57.895 --> 10:02.972
But I wonder, is there a way
that I could meet her?

10:04.642 --> 10:06.713
I mean, not in person, but...

10:06.780 --> 10:08.282
On the phone?

10:08.349 --> 10:10.453
Yeah, maybe, or...

10:12.391 --> 10:15.831
Maybe you could have her over

10:15.898 --> 10:18.369
for lunch or dinner, upstairs.

10:18.435 --> 10:23.781
You could leave the door open,
talk loudly.

10:23.848 --> 10:24.883
That's a terrible idea.

10:24.949 --> 10:28.322
Yeah, yeah.

10:29.726 --> 10:31.797
Or, you know,

10:31.864 --> 10:36.740
my daughter, with her kids,
had this nanny cam.

10:36.806 --> 10:39.111
And she could see and hear everything

10:39.177 --> 10:40.948
that they were doing in
their room.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.352
Maybe you could get
one of those.

10:43.419 --> 10:45.423
And I could watch

10:45.490 --> 10:46.960
and hear you two interacting.

10:47.026 --> 10:50.032
And then I could give you
my professional opinion.

10:53.473 --> 10:56.647
That feels like it would be...

10:56.714 --> 10:58.617
not honest.

10:59.385 --> 11:02.224
It's normally not healthy
to spy on another person,

11:02.291 --> 11:05.697
especially someone
you are trying

11:05.764 --> 11:08.704
to explore
a trusting relationship with.

11:08.770 --> 11:12.912
But these are
extreme circumstances.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.424
Hmm.

11:20.761 --> 11:23.600
Mom?!

11:23.667 --> 11:26.873
Can you come down here?

11:34.087 --> 11:35.423
I'm inviting Mary over

11:35.490 --> 11:37.127
for brunch.

11:37.193 --> 11:38.129
What?

11:38.196 --> 11:41.135
I'm inviting Mary
over for brunch.

11:41.202 --> 11:44.709
Dr. Strauss wants to meet her,
he's gonna watch on a nanny cam.

11:44.776 --> 11:47.982
I'm not sure I...

11:49.117 --> 11:51.321
You want Mary to come over?

11:51.388 --> 11:55.864
I was telling Sam he needs
to develop more relationships

11:55.931 --> 11:57.568
in order to expand the meaning

11:57.635 --> 11:59.205
in his life.

11:59.271 --> 12:02.477
I think that kind of meaning
can start to help take the place

12:02.545 --> 12:04.481
of his problematic obsessions.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.987
But... Mary?

12:07.054 --> 12:10.528
- Shouldn't it be someone new?
- Maybe.

12:10.595 --> 12:14.134
But my thinking is,
he's already gotten very far

12:14.201 --> 12:16.005
in his relationship with Mary.

12:16.072 --> 12:17.908
And at this point,
he has a strong need to...

12:17.975 --> 12:19.378
She's coming.

12:19.445 --> 12:22.985
Tomorrow at 10:00.

12:24.488 --> 12:26.358
Well...

12:26.425 --> 12:28.495
I always liked Mary.

13:00.393 --> 13:03.232
You already got Elias killed.

13:03.299 --> 13:06.105
That wasn't totally your fault.

13:06.171 --> 13:08.677
But if Sam chokes Mary to death?

13:08.743 --> 13:10.981
That's a hundred percent on you.

13:11.048 --> 13:12.585
What do you want me to do?

13:12.652 --> 13:14.622
I'm not the Terminator.

13:14.688 --> 13:17.160
I stab him with this bullshit
half-knife,

13:17.227 --> 13:21.135
what, is he just gonna lie down
on the floor and bleed out?

13:21.202 --> 13:23.238
I'll be lucky if I get
one good jab in.

13:23.305 --> 13:27.281
But with Mary upstairs,
I can stab him,

13:27.347 --> 13:29.184
scream,
and she'll call the police.

13:29.251 --> 13:31.757
Him going for this
is a fucking miracle.

13:31.823 --> 13:34.128
It's a gift from God.

13:34.194 --> 13:36.432
Except you're assuming,
when you stab him

13:36.499 --> 13:39.606
with your foot cream tube
and scream for help,

13:39.673 --> 13:43.212
his mom won't just whomp Mary
over the head with a frying pan.

13:43.278 --> 13:45.818
Right, that's what I'm assuming.

13:45.884 --> 13:49.592
A Hail Mary with Mary.

14:15.611 --> 14:16.913
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

14:16.980 --> 14:18.950
I can hear!

14:27.601 --> 14:31.308
They didn't have these
when my kids were babies.

14:34.615 --> 14:36.853
- Dr. Strauss.
- Mm.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.059
You're not gonna...

14:41.162 --> 14:42.698
You probably think

14:42.765 --> 14:45.971
that I wouldn't hurt Mary
because I care about her.

14:46.740 --> 14:49.210
And that's true.

14:52.250 --> 14:56.325
But if-if you did
something stupid

14:56.392 --> 14:58.831
and she found out
that you were down here...

14:58.897 --> 15:02.370
if you created a situation where
I had no other choice, I...

15:02.437 --> 15:05.577
Sam, my only goal

15:05.644 --> 15:08.683
is for this brunch date
to go well for you.

15:14.260 --> 15:16.064
What are you serving?

15:16.131 --> 15:18.369
Indian from Maruti.

15:18.435 --> 15:20.473
Mmm, does Mary like Indian?

15:20.541 --> 15:21.676
No, not that much.

15:21.742 --> 15:25.283
I... you know, Sam,
I would encourage you

15:25.349 --> 15:27.555
to think about what she might
like to eat.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.357
You're the host,

15:29.424 --> 15:32.296
and you want her
to have a good time, right?

15:33.498 --> 15:34.668
Yeah.

15:35.838 --> 15:37.240
That's a good idea.

15:45.690 --> 15:47.528
What do I say to her?

15:47.595 --> 15:52.471
Well... you guys used
to talk, right?

15:52.538 --> 15:55.042
Yeah.

15:56.212 --> 15:58.584
Would you be comfortable
trying some role-play?

15:58.650 --> 15:59.752
That's where you practice

15:59.819 --> 16:01.957
a situation that you're going
to be in.

16:02.023 --> 16:03.458
I can play the part of Mary,

16:03.526 --> 16:07.000
and we could just try
to have a conversation.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.872
Like a real,
like a real conversation?

16:09.939 --> 16:12.110
Yes.

16:12.177 --> 16:16.552
Why don't you try saying,
"How have you been?"

16:17.989 --> 16:19.692
How have you been?

16:19.759 --> 16:23.199
How, how have, how have you--
how have you been?

16:23.266 --> 16:25.838
How have you been?

16:25.904 --> 16:29.210
Pretty good, how about you?

16:30.981 --> 16:33.787
Pretty good, pretty good.

16:33.853 --> 16:38.028
Pretty good, I've been pretty,
I've been pretty good.

16:38.095 --> 16:40.066
I've been pretty good--
can I be Mary?

16:40.133 --> 16:42.137
Uh... sure, yes.

16:42.203 --> 16:44.976
Let's try that.

16:45.043 --> 16:49.317
It's so good to see you again,
Mary, how have you been?

16:52.791 --> 16:55.096
Pretty good, how about you?

16:55.162 --> 16:57.835
Um, I've been doing okay.

16:57.902 --> 17:00.173
A lot going on at work.

17:00.239 --> 17:02.544
How are things going
at work for you?

17:04.682 --> 17:07.119
Pretty good.

17:10.126 --> 17:11.796
I don't want to do this.

17:26.158 --> 17:27.527
Dr. Strauss.

17:28.896 --> 17:30.499
If...

17:31.401 --> 17:34.374
If Mary and I had a baby...

17:36.312 --> 17:39.117
...would it be like me?

17:42.457 --> 17:46.264
Nobody knows how their kids
are going to turn out, Sam.

19:41.562 --> 19:44.000
This is the, uh,
Waldorf salad from Milo's.

19:44.067 --> 19:46.773
Oh... I love that.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.579
But you didn't have to get me
something special.

19:49.645 --> 19:52.617
You get gas when you
eat Indian food.

20:58.883 --> 21:00.921
Mm.

21:00.988 --> 21:02.356
The salad's great.

21:14.748 --> 21:16.284
Mm.

21:18.221 --> 21:21.695
A Jew was sentenced
to death.

21:22.964 --> 21:25.771
A British guy says...

21:25.838 --> 21:27.106
No, he's French.

21:27.173 --> 21:29.043
French guy.

21:29.110 --> 21:32.551
A French guy said to kill him
with the guillotine.

21:32.617 --> 21:34.755
He's-- he's sentenced
to death, too.

21:34.822 --> 21:37.894
<i>That's the-- they're all--
so the British guy--</i>

21:37.961 --> 21:39.665
<i>there's another British guy
there, and...</i>

21:39.732 --> 21:44.240
The British guy...
sentenced to death...

21:44.307 --> 21:46.211
he wanted to be shot

21:46.277 --> 21:49.384
in the head, he says,

21:49.450 --> 21:51.021
"Uh, shoot me."

21:51.088 --> 21:52.590
So they shoot him in the head.

21:52.657 --> 21:57.333
<i>And the Jewish guy--
they said, "How?"</i>

21:57.400 --> 21:59.337
They said, "How?"

21:59.404 --> 22:04.480
And then the Jewish guy says,
"Old age."

22:10.660 --> 22:12.096
I'll be right back.

22:18.408 --> 22:19.712
<i>Some more tea?</i>

22:19.778 --> 22:20.914
<i>Oh, no, I'm good, thank you.</i>

22:25.222 --> 22:26.559
<i>I have all these kinds of tea.</i>

22:26.625 --> 22:28.963
<i>A whole cabinet.</i>

22:29.030 --> 22:31.067
<i>I don't even remember
buying it all.</i>

22:32.872 --> 22:34.575
:
It's going really bad.

22:34.642 --> 22:37.479
I don't,
I don't know what to say.

22:37.547 --> 22:40.119
I think you should try asking
her a question.

22:40.185 --> 22:44.427
Either what's going on at work,
or how's her family?

22:46.097 --> 22:48.503
Okay.

22:48.570 --> 22:50.372
<i>How are your parents, Mary?</i>

22:50.439 --> 22:53.078
<i>Normal, I guess.</i>

22:53.145 --> 22:54.615
Why is this so hard?

22:54.681 --> 22:57.788
It just is.
It's hard for everyone.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.592
<i>Your dad okay?</i>

22:59.658 --> 23:01.562
<i>Yeah, he's doing okay.</i>

23:01.629 --> 23:04.668
<i>He's not walking
like he used to.</i>

23:04.735 --> 23:07.473
<i>Mom thinks he needs
cataract surgery.</i>

23:09.679 --> 23:11.381
<i>At our age, it all goes wrong</i>

23:11.448 --> 23:14.053
<i>one thing at a time,
but I'm sure he'll be fine.</i>

23:14.120 --> 23:16.258
<i>Yeah, that's what he says--
"It'll be fine."</i>

23:16.324 --> 23:18.629
<i>But then we'll be, like,
in the middle of dinner...</i>

23:19.699 --> 23:22.469
You're gonna get
that girl killed.

23:23.873 --> 23:26.879
<i>It's easy to take it
for granted.</i>

23:29.184 --> 23:31.288
<i>I've been trying
to exercise more.</i>

23:31.354 --> 23:33.425
<i>Good for you.</i>

23:33.491 --> 23:35.763
I should get back up.

23:37.032 --> 23:39.003
<i>It's so boring.</i>

23:41.074 --> 23:43.245
You don't like
the lox and bagels?

23:43.312 --> 23:45.082
<i>I wish.</i>

23:45.149 --> 23:46.384
<i>One day.</i>

23:46.451 --> 23:48.723
I'd rather have Indian.

23:49.525 --> 23:51.829
Okay. I might need more advice.

23:51.896 --> 23:56.572
<i>You know that pill that stops
you from having a heart attack?</i>

23:56.639 --> 23:58.008
<i>There are all these people</i>

23:58.075 --> 24:01.381
<i>who just eat whatever they want,
don't exercise,</i>

24:01.448 --> 24:04.855
<i>and then they take
these pills called statins.</i>

24:06.258 --> 24:07.561
<i>Maybe that should be plan B.</i>

24:07.628 --> 24:10.165
<i>Probably.</i>

24:11.034 --> 24:13.540
<i>Heart attacks--
they don't really scare me</i>

24:13.607 --> 24:15.176
<i>too much, though.</i>

24:15.242 --> 24:17.748
Strokes, on the other hand.

24:17.814 --> 24:19.619
I don't think it runs
in the family,

24:19.685 --> 24:22.189
but, well, who knows?

24:27.200 --> 24:30.039
So, how have you been doing
at work lately?

24:30.105 --> 24:31.742
Good.

24:31.809 --> 24:33.747
Um, do you remember Carolina?

24:33.813 --> 24:38.188
- Mm.
- She left about two months ago,
and they haven't replaced her,

24:38.255 --> 24:39.858
so I'm doing everything.

24:39.925 --> 24:41.528
Are they going to replace her?

24:41.595 --> 24:44.668
They haven't even listed
the position yet.

24:44.735 --> 24:47.908
You're gonna have to keep
doing all of her work.

24:47.975 --> 24:48.709
That's not fair.

24:48.776 --> 24:52.784
Yeah, well, fair...

24:57.894 --> 25:00.366
<i>You're never going
to believe this, but...</i>

25:00.432 --> 25:03.272
I kind of miss the La-Z-Boy.

25:04.675 --> 25:06.077
It's very comfortable.

25:06.144 --> 25:08.482
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.656
I could, I could bring it back

25:11.722 --> 25:12.691
- if you want.
- Oh, no, that's okay.

25:12.757 --> 25:14.360
- No?
- No.

25:14.427 --> 25:19.204
<i>I have other good chairs,
and the couch.</i>

25:19.270 --> 25:21.575
That chair was his father's.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.618
My father beat me up a lot.

25:27.486 --> 25:29.423
When I was a kid.

25:29.490 --> 25:32.597
That's why I went into therapy.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.035
Oh...

25:35.102 --> 25:38.108
Sam.

25:41.849 --> 25:43.853
<i>So, my parents got a new cat.</i>

25:45.255 --> 25:48.128
The old one, well,
he's not old...

25:49.932 --> 25:52.003
Let me help you with that,
and then I need to get home.

25:52.070 --> 25:53.973
No, no, dear, just let me do it.

25:57.313 --> 26:00.721
Help, Mary, I'm Sam's prisoner
down here!

26:00.787 --> 26:02.791
Call the police! Help!

26:19.658 --> 26:23.164
<i>So, uh, okay, let me
walk you to your car.</i>

27:21.682 --> 27:23.853
Mary left.

27:25.155 --> 27:26.892
She said

27:26.959 --> 27:32.203
she thinks it's good for exes
to have a friendly relationship.

27:33.104 --> 27:37.012
And she thinks that we should do
this once a year.

27:39.350 --> 27:40.920
What are you feeling?

27:40.987 --> 27:44.861
Mary's not going to get
back together with me.

27:45.963 --> 27:48.969
How does that make you feel?

27:49.036 --> 27:50.238
Bad.

27:52.076 --> 27:54.113
Sad.

27:57.920 --> 28:01.963
That was a mistake,
her coming here was...

28:02.029 --> 28:03.933
Why did you have me do that?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.672
N-No, that's wrong.

28:06.739 --> 28:09.009
It wasn't a mistake.

28:09.076 --> 28:11.247
This is very important for you.

28:11.314 --> 28:15.756
To find meaningful relationships.

28:15.823 --> 28:19.998
It means taking risks
and getting hurt.

28:20.065 --> 28:23.005
Then taking another risk
and getting hurt again.

28:23.071 --> 28:26.410
Until you find
relationships that work.

28:26.477 --> 28:29.384
And that is exactly
what life requires.

28:29.450 --> 28:33.659
- I don't feel good.
- Yes, that's part of it.

28:33.726 --> 28:36.464
And that pain
is telling you something.

28:36.532 --> 28:39.638
You've been following it
in the wrong direction.

28:39.704 --> 28:43.278
But now that you're getting
to know yourself better,

28:43.345 --> 28:45.549
it will tell you
where you need to go.

28:45.616 --> 28:47.721
I promise.

28:47.788 --> 28:50.793
It doesn't matter.

28:50.860 --> 28:53.966
I'm going to see
Mr. Buchella next week.

28:57.674 --> 28:59.043
What are you going to tell him?

28:59.110 --> 29:01.448
I'll tell him the same stuff
I told you.

29:01.515 --> 29:04.420
But hopefully it works with him.

29:04.487 --> 29:05.890
You know...

29:05.957 --> 29:10.165
in therapy, Sam,
you can't push people.

29:10.232 --> 29:12.671
You have to let them
come to their own insights

29:12.738 --> 29:14.474
in their own time.

29:14.541 --> 29:19.184
That being said, I would suggest
and encourage you

29:19.250 --> 29:22.356
to talk with Mr. Buchella specifically

29:22.423 --> 29:24.326
about what your father
did to you.

29:26.197 --> 29:28.468
I told you all about my father.

29:28.536 --> 29:30.506
It was the first thing
that I told you.

29:30.573 --> 29:32.009
- That is true.
- Mm-hmm.

29:32.076 --> 29:34.413
But you had trouble
giving me details.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.453
It was hard for you to tell me
a really full story.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.492
And for you to go forward
with Mr. Buchella

29:40.560 --> 29:43.666
or anyone, I think
it is very important

29:43.732 --> 29:45.268
that you try to access

29:45.335 --> 29:48.375
those memories and those
deeper feelings about him.

29:48.442 --> 29:50.780
I don't have any trouble
accessing my memories

29:50.847 --> 29:53.452
or my feelings.
I remember everything.

29:53.519 --> 29:56.257
You, you think
that I don't remember?

29:56.324 --> 29:58.394
I think about it all the time,
I think about...

29:58.461 --> 30:02.236
every time he hit me,
every time he looked at me,

30:02.302 --> 30:04.841
the way he looked at me,
the way he hated me.

30:04.908 --> 30:06.343
What the f...

30:06.410 --> 30:10.820
This, this-- Sam,
what's happening right now,

30:10.886 --> 30:12.489
how you're feeling...

30:12.557 --> 30:16.732
When you get so angry
that you hurt someone,

30:16.798 --> 30:19.838
that's a version of what's
happening in this exact moment.

30:19.904 --> 30:22.744
And at the root of it is your
father, as we've discussed.

30:22.810 --> 30:27.285
It's not the people you hurt
that you're mad at, it's him.

30:32.530 --> 30:36.037
So you-you think that I kill
people because of him?

30:36.103 --> 30:39.309
Almost instead of him.

30:41.347 --> 30:42.517
Oh.

30:45.923 --> 30:47.927
I get it.

31:08.001 --> 31:11.174
This is a guy named
Edmund Kemper.

31:11.241 --> 31:16.051
He is the one guy who I feel,
he's the only one.

31:16.117 --> 31:18.923
Just, just watch this.

31:19.691 --> 31:23.231
<i>It was springtime, it was April.</i>

31:23.297 --> 31:26.538
<i>Uh, for two months
I hadn't killed.</i>

31:26.605 --> 31:29.410
<i>And I said it's not going
to happen to any more girls.</i>

31:29.476 --> 31:32.216
<i>It's got to stay between
me and my mother.</i>

31:32.283 --> 31:35.656
<i>That was one week
before I murdered my mother.</i>

31:35.723 --> 31:40.365
<i>I said, she's got to die, or
girls like that are gonna die.</i>

31:40.432 --> 31:43.404
<i>And that's when I decided
I'm going to murder my mother.</i>

31:43.471 --> 31:46.745
<i>In his case, he said publicly
that it was his mother</i>

31:46.812 --> 31:48.381
<i>that he was killing all along.</i>

31:48.448 --> 31:51.087
<i>And when he killed his mother,
that was the end.</i>

31:51.153 --> 31:52.590
<i>It's a very deep
psychological observation</i>

31:52.657 --> 31:54.828
<i>from himself.
It may be very accurate.</i>

31:54.895 --> 31:57.032
<i>Got on the telephone
and turned himself in.</i>

31:57.099 --> 31:59.170
<i>He said it was time
for the killing to stop.</i>

31:59.237 --> 32:03.111
<i>I came out of her vagina, see?</i>

32:03.178 --> 32:05.448
<i>I came out of my mother.</i>

32:05.516 --> 32:07.887
<i>And in a rage
I went right back in.</i>

32:07.954 --> 32:10.125
<i>I cut off her head.</i>

32:10.191 --> 32:13.197
<i>And, and I humiliated
her corpse.</i>

32:13.264 --> 32:15.002
He fucked her skull.

32:15.068 --> 32:19.645
<i>It had to stop, it had to stop.
Uh, once my mother was dead,</i>

32:19.711 --> 32:22.083
<i>there was almost a cathartic
process at that point.</i>

32:22.149 --> 32:24.988
<i>- I got physically...</i>
- See?

32:25.055 --> 32:26.725
Kemper said everyone he killed,

32:26.792 --> 32:30.332
he was just killing his mother
over and over again-- me, too.

32:30.398 --> 32:32.269
It's the same for me,
just with my father.

32:32.335 --> 32:34.273
- I don't think that this...
- You're the one who said
I kill people

32:34.340 --> 32:38.381
instead of him, so if I kill
him, I'll be done.

32:38.448 --> 32:40.084
I won't have to kill
any other people.

32:40.151 --> 32:42.155
- Sam.
- And if there's one person,
one person who needs

32:42.222 --> 32:43.659
to get what he deserves,
it's that piece of shit.

32:43.726 --> 32:45.128
Sam!

32:45.195 --> 32:47.767
Sam, you cannot and must not
kill your father.

32:47.834 --> 32:49.571
This is good.

32:49.638 --> 32:54.948
I feel like... I finally know
what I have to do.

32:55.014 --> 32:56.117
Sam, we, we should keep talking.

32:56.184 --> 32:58.890
We need to keep talking, Sam.

32:58.956 --> 33:00.392
I'm gonna kill my father,

33:00.459 --> 33:04.466
cut his head off,
and fuck his skull.

33:07.673 --> 33:10.311
I'm just kidding, I'm not
going to fuck his skull.
