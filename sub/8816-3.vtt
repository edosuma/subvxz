You know A-Bomb loves
his Bloody Mary spicy.

19:15.095 --> 19:16.962
Alan?!
You, too?!

19:16.964 --> 19:18.397
Okay.

19:18.399 --> 19:21.934
You must stop encouraging
other spirits to leave.

19:21.936 --> 19:24.102
And there is no brunch here!

19:24.104 --> 19:27.572
No Netflix,
no brunch, and no birthdays.

19:27.574 --> 19:29.841
Okay, this place is bumming me out.

19:29.843 --> 19:31.877
Time to go, Hayley.
What?! No!

19:31.879 --> 19:33.278
I'm staying!
You can't.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.880
I'm pretty sure
you're my plus-one.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.114
She's just my plus one, right?

19:36.116 --> 19:37.916
Yeah.
All right, we outtie!

19:37.918 --> 19:39.284
Wait!

19:39.286 --> 19:42.988
Aw, man, now I'm stuck here
with just Nathan.

19:42.990 --> 19:45.490
Y-You know,
I just don't think

19:45.492 --> 19:49.661
I could go another minute
without a soft pretzel.

19:53.334 --> 19:55.434
Sure, I could've stayed in nirvana.

19:55.436 --> 19:57.235
I was definitely a natural,

19:57.237 --> 19:59.671
but I would've had to
give up all my stuff.

19:59.673 --> 20:02.274
Yeah, I think
that's the lesson I learned --

20:02.276 --> 20:04.609
the most important thing in life
is stuff.

20:04.611 --> 20:06.878
Thank you
for teaching me that, Hayley.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.347
Next time I see you crying,

20:08.349 --> 20:09.614
remind me not to care.

20:09.616 --> 20:11.483
I wasn't crying, you were crying.

20:11.485 --> 20:13.385
Oh, no, what's wrong, babe?

20:14.221 --> 20:15.687
"Hunchback of Notre Dame"!

20:15.689 --> 20:18.623
That's what
the "sanctuary" thing was from!
