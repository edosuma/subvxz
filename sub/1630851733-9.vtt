09:20.093 --> 09:22.062
Wow, season two
came to bring it.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.797
BRAD: It's sensational.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.266
BROOKE LYNN: When they say
"the art of drag,"

09:26.266 --> 09:27.367
this is what they mean.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.874
- Icesis.
- Yes, my love?

09:33.874 --> 09:37.644
BRAD: You brought
the fashion every single week.

09:37.644 --> 09:38.745
ICESIS: Thank you.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.881
You also won
two design challenges.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.850
- I did.
- So how gagged are you?

09:43.850 --> 09:47.988
I mean, I'm not surprised.
I put in a lot of work.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.323
Like, I stayed up
for like 16 hour days

09:50.323 --> 09:52.592
just trying
to get everything done.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.063
So I'm really happy
that everything went over well,

09:56.063 --> 09:58.698
-and that you, especially you...
-Aw, thank you.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.001
- ...enjoyed my looks.
- I was obsessed.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.602
- BRAD: Pythia.
- Yes?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.971
Your creativity
is definitely unmatched.

10:04.971 --> 10:08.208
Where does all that
imagination come from?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.177
- It's like out of this world.
- I don't know.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.645
Growing up in
a very conservative country,

10:11.645 --> 10:15.949
like, I didn't really have
these ways to escape reality,

10:15.949 --> 10:18.685
and they all sort of
lived within me,

10:18.685 --> 10:20.353
because it was a way
for me to escape.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.690
So, I'm very happy
that you guys see it, you know?

10:23.690 --> 10:25.792
It's like all these characters
inside of me, like, make up

10:25.792 --> 10:27.227
who I am, as Pythia.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.830
The looks are just
like a God-given gift.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.631
- I don't know what to say.
- (Others laughing)

10:31.631 --> 10:33.467
I agree.
I agree.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.668
BRAD: Oh, my goodness!

10:34.668 --> 10:37.070
Well, speaking of
your God-given gift,

10:37.070 --> 10:39.606
how did you feel when Icesis
won the design challenges?

10:39.606 --> 10:42.209
- (All laughing)
- Here we go.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.778
No, no, no, I'm very proud
that you won these challenges.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.146
You a hundred percent
deserve them.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.948
It's just I was like, you know,
bitter, 'cause I was like,

10:47.948 --> 10:49.049
"Oh, dammit.
I wanted that."

10:49.049 --> 10:50.183
- Well, obviously,
because we're designers.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.318
- But, of course!
- And we wanna win.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.486
We all want
to win everything, right?

10:52.486 --> 10:53.720
Maybe once or twice?

10:53.720 --> 10:56.723
(Others laughing)

10:56.723 --> 10:58.458
- And Kendall?
- Hi.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.560
- BRAD: I have one word for you.
- Uh-oh.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.496
- Can you guess what it is?
- Bodysuit.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.332
- Yes!
- (All laughing)

11:05.332 --> 11:06.366
ICESIS:
I knew that was coming!

11:06.366 --> 11:08.902
Yes!
Yes, bodysuit!

11:08.902 --> 11:11.571
- Bitch, I love my bodysuits.
- BRAD: Me too!

11:11.571 --> 11:13.740
- There are a lot of them.
- KENDALL: Oh, you know it.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.809
You look gorgeous today,
by the way.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.943
Thank you.
There's a bodysuit underneath.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.078
- No, I'm just kidding.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.546
- (All laughing)
- KENDALL: I'm just kidding.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.047
But, you know
I love the body-ody-ody

11:21.047 --> 11:22.482
in the body-ody-ody-suit.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.684
- Eh!
- BRAD: Okay?

11:24.684 --> 11:28.355
- Beth, hello!
- Hi!

11:28.355 --> 11:29.756
(Cheering)

11:29.756 --> 11:31.691
You were our first queen out.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.394
- Oh, rub it in.
- (All laughing)

11:34.394 --> 11:35.795
What did we miss out on?

11:35.795 --> 11:38.999
Um, first off,
if we're playing golf, I won.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.000
- Golf?
- Play golf?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.435
- Lowest points.
- Sports?

11:42.435 --> 11:44.604
- What?
- So, we didn't miss any comedy.

11:44.604 --> 11:47.541
(Others laughing)

11:47.541 --> 11:50.710
I think you really missed out on
a very elevated version of Beth.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.012
I feel like
I've really pushed myself

11:52.012 --> 11:54.281
in the last few years to grow,

11:54.281 --> 11:56.616
and this opportunity,
I really wanted to prove that

11:56.616 --> 11:58.018
to a lot of people.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.520
And I'm sad I didn't get to show
that, but I'm gonna show it,

12:00.520 --> 12:01.888
and I'm ready
for the world to see it.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.858
Because, I am
an amazing drag queen,

12:04.858 --> 12:06.793
and it's taken me
a long time to realize that,

12:06.793 --> 12:08.428
but, I know I'm amazing.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.930
- You are amazing.
- You are amazing.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.431
- You are.
- You are so amazing.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.167
I love you.
For real.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.002
- Océane.
- Hey, hey!

12:16.002 --> 12:19.072
(Cheering)

12:19.072 --> 12:22.209
You sailed away too soon.
One might say.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.443
- Mm-hm!
- BRAD: But--

12:23.443 --> 12:26.012
Not just one might say.
A lot of people might say.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.481
BRAD: Yeah, I think so.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.517
What would you say is
the biggest thing you learned?

12:30.517 --> 12:32.352
Well, the biggest thing
that I learned

12:32.352 --> 12:36.523
is that when I got back home,
I decided to subscribe to a gym.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.758
- (Laughing)
- Oh, girl!

12:38.758 --> 12:41.361
Being able to sing
and dance at the same time,

12:41.361 --> 12:43.029
it was impossible for my body,

12:43.029 --> 12:44.931
because I was like
gasping for air.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.935
So I was losing focus on
the lyrics, on the choreography,

12:48.935 --> 12:51.705
but, like, I think
I'm gonna be able to sing

12:51.705 --> 12:54.541
when we're gonna see me
on tour and everything.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.476
- Yes!
- Oh, my God, yes!

12:56.476 --> 12:59.579
You brought such a wonderful joy

12:59.579 --> 13:01.881
to the competition,
and I can't wait to see more.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.283
- Yes, you will see.
- BRAD: Yeah, for sure.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.351
(Laughing)

13:04.351 --> 13:05.986
- We love you so much!
- We love you.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.657
Adriana, you just
missed out on the top four.

13:10.657 --> 13:11.658
So close.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.727
But you really gave these queens

13:13.727 --> 13:15.028
a run for their money.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.964
Let's take a look
at some of your best moments.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.966
Oh, my God.

13:19.966 --> 13:23.236
ADRIANA: Get ready
for this Colombian heat,

13:23.236 --> 13:25.538
'cause it's gonna
fire up your TV!

13:25.538 --> 13:27.474
♪

13:27.474 --> 13:29.075
Are you ready for
this, papi?

13:29.075 --> 13:31.177
♪

13:31.177 --> 13:33.079
BROOKE LYNN: One thing
I really appreciate about you

13:33.079 --> 13:35.115
is how versatile you can be.

13:35.115 --> 13:39.286
You can be so beautiful and so
poised, but also just so campy.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.855
You were just
so committed and so funny.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.224
- Ooh!
- (Brad laughing)

13:44.224 --> 13:45.425
Boobs.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.595
- Ah!
- I'm living.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.064
This look
is one of my favourites

13:51.064 --> 13:52.899
of any of
the Drag Race franchises.

13:52.899 --> 13:53.900
Oh, my God.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.636
BRAD: Every detail was splendid.

13:56.636 --> 13:57.904
ADRIANA: I am fashion.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.407
I am looks.
I'm a performer.

14:00.407 --> 14:04.477
And I am your sexy Latina
coochie-coochie caliente!

14:05.945 --> 14:08.915
- Yay!
- So beautiful!

14:08.915 --> 14:11.251
Do you feel like
you were underestimated

14:11.251 --> 14:13.186
by the other girls
in the competition?

14:13.186 --> 14:17.490
Um, I did felt
a little underestimated.

14:17.490 --> 14:22.228
I know that I didn't get
to show a lot of performance.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.930
Well, you won
the acting challenge.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.799
-I did win the acting challenge.
-BRAD: Yeah.

14:25.799 --> 14:27.033
- Oh, my God.
- BRAD: Which was very comedic.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.602
- Truly iconic.
- I'm very proud of what I did.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.538
- You should be.
- We're proud, yeah.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.106
- BRAD: You're amazing.
- Thank you.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.342
What did the rest of you
think of Adriana?

14:35.342 --> 14:38.645
I have to say,
your shit was so, so gag worthy.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.880
Like, hats off to you, bitch.
It was amazing.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.882
Your looks, the stone work,

14:42.882 --> 14:45.685
the embellishment
is just phenomenal

14:45.685 --> 14:47.253
and out of this world.

14:47.253 --> 14:48.988
ADRIANA: Thank you.
I feel that I'm kind of

14:48.988 --> 14:50.857
someone else onstage,

14:50.857 --> 14:52.292
'cause when you
see me backstage,

14:52.292 --> 14:53.993
it's like this quiet guy.

14:53.993 --> 14:58.998
You might have been quiet, but
you were deadly, girl, deadly!

14:58.998 --> 15:00.400
You were so fantastic.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.870
Speaking of "deadly,"
let's talk about the brat pack.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.373
- (Groaning)
- Oh, God!

15:06.373 --> 15:10.310
BRAD: Kendall, Synthia,
and Gia, what a trio.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.611
- Yeah.
- The trifecta.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.912
- Kendall?
- Yes.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.515
What was it like when
you saw Gia in the Werk Room,

15:15.515 --> 15:18.585
then saw Synthia
walk in right after you?

15:18.585 --> 15:23.590
(Screaming)

15:27.627 --> 15:28.962
- SYNTHIA: Hi, guys!
- KENDALL: Hi!

15:28.962 --> 15:30.163
- STEPHANIE: Who's she?

15:30.163 --> 15:32.298
That was, honestly,
one of the most, like,

15:32.298 --> 15:34.434
unexpected moments
of my entire life.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.670
I mean, these girls
I've known for so many years.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.239
Completely blew my mind.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.474
I literally get, like,
my back hairs are sticking up.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.877
- I just... (Laughing)
- Forgot to shave 'em.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.345
Well.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.047
Um, but, like, who would not
want to enter into this crazy,

15:48.047 --> 15:51.418
amazing platform with
your literal best friends?

15:51.418 --> 15:52.519
Yep.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.255
So what was it like
for everyone else?

15:55.255 --> 15:57.891
- (Laughing)
- KENDALL: Oh, my God.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.260
Did it really
affect you all that much?

16:00.260 --> 16:01.561
KIMORA: I'll say something.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.763
For me,
I loved seeing the camaraderie

16:03.763 --> 16:05.432
and the sisterhood,
because it just reminds me

16:05.432 --> 16:06.766
of my sisters back home.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.802
BETH: I'll say, um,
it definitely threw me off,

16:08.802 --> 16:10.036
like seeing these three,

16:10.036 --> 16:11.604
'cause I know what they're
capable of in Vancouver,

16:11.604 --> 16:13.440
and I've watched them for years.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.376
And I was so excited
to, like, know some people here.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.878
The one thing that bugged me
was I was about to lip-sync

16:18.878 --> 16:20.947
and, you know, the girls
who I've known for like a day

16:20.947 --> 16:22.849
came and said, like, "Good luck.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.083
We believe in you.
You can do this."

16:24.083 --> 16:26.553
But, I had to come
to you guys and, like, say bye,

16:26.553 --> 16:27.754
and that kind of
stung a little bit,

16:27.754 --> 16:29.856
especially knowing you, but...

16:29.856 --> 16:32.158
I think it was just hard
because, it was obviously...

16:32.158 --> 16:33.893
It was Gia lip-synching
the first week.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.261
- It was me, yeah.
- Yeah, and I get that.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.130
I probably just kind of
beelined my focus to her,

16:37.130 --> 16:38.998
but that has nothing
to do with you,

16:38.998 --> 16:40.467
or like
how much I care for you.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.569
And Kendall and I know how
to get Gia focused like that.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.636
- Yeah.
- That's what it was, yeah.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.038
So, it was like...
it was the energy.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.840
Yeah, it was kind of like
fight or flight for us three,

16:46.840 --> 16:48.041
at that moment,
so I do apologize though.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.042
Yeah, girl.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.243
SUKI: You know,
I think it affected more

16:50.243 --> 16:51.778
the people
that you actually know

16:51.778 --> 16:54.113
that you didn't give any
of the attention and all that.

16:54.113 --> 16:57.851
I know Eve had like a moment,
several moments with Kendall.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.253
- (All laughing)
- Oh, no.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.921
SUKI:
But it's so understandable.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.156
You guys are sisters,

17:03.156 --> 17:05.325
even tighter than
the sisterhood we have here now.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.726
- KENDALL: Yeah.
- So, it's just...

17:06.726 --> 17:08.394
- It's the game.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.196
I know this was really annoying
for everyone else,

17:10.196 --> 17:13.700
but, to have you guys
in the competition, like...

17:13.700 --> 17:15.001
- Apparently.
- No, no.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.269
It really was a gift,

17:16.269 --> 17:18.738
and I feel, like,
not only closer with you two,

17:18.738 --> 17:20.240
but all 12 of us.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.542
Like, it's just been
so fucking amazing,

17:22.542 --> 17:24.611
and ultimately,
we killed it out there.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.613
Yeah, I feel like
everything that's being said

17:26.613 --> 17:28.748
is kind of what happened
in the first three weeks.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.749
That's true.

17:29.749 --> 17:33.086
And what many of you don't know,

17:33.086 --> 17:34.487
because
you're sitting on that side...

17:34.487 --> 17:37.056
(Others gasping and laughing)

17:37.056 --> 17:38.625
..is that throughout
the competition.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.860
Rude and uncalled for.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.362
You know, coming in here

17:42.362 --> 17:45.265
and being in this
intense environment

17:45.265 --> 17:47.233
with your best friends,

17:47.233 --> 17:51.504
it's awesome,
but we also did a fantastic job

17:51.504 --> 17:53.006
at, like,
creating new relationships

17:53.006 --> 17:56.910
and built so many strong,
meaningful connections

17:56.910 --> 17:59.879
with so many girls
sitting on this stage.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.181
- Well, Eve.
- Uh-oh. (Laughing)

18:02.181 --> 18:05.184
You and Gia
actually had some tense moments.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.619
Did we?
Oh, my God!

18:06.619 --> 18:07.754
- I don't even remember.
- Especially early on.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.922
What did I say to Gia?

18:08.922 --> 18:10.423
I think the first thing
you said to me was...

18:10.423 --> 18:11.558
Oh, she knows.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.692
.."You unfollowed me
on social media, bitch.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.060
(Laughing)

18:14.060 --> 18:15.562
I was just like
"Yeah, whatever."

18:15.562 --> 18:17.730
So, but we cleared that up
very quickly.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.433
EVE: I think Gia and I
are similar personality types.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.568
STEPHANIE: Gia disagrees.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.036
(Others laughing)

18:23.036 --> 18:26.172
I'm like,
"You see a similarity, hon!"

18:26.172 --> 18:27.607
GIA: No.
You know what?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.342
I don't think
Eve and I ever had beef.

18:29.342 --> 18:32.579
Like, there were moments
where I did reach out my hand

18:32.579 --> 18:36.049
to help you through a moment,
and I feel like I was shut down.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.250
Well, I'm sorry
that you felt like that.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.252
I really felt, like,
backed up against a wall

18:39.252 --> 18:41.788
because I don't think
any of you went through

18:41.788 --> 18:43.590
what I went through,
in terms of the critiques

18:43.590 --> 18:45.425
every single week
I was up there.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.493
It was very, very, very hard
for me dealing with that,

18:47.493 --> 18:49.362
and then,
coming back to Untucked,

18:49.362 --> 18:50.463
and, like,
venting my feelings,

18:50.463 --> 18:51.698
but then I get critiqued there,

18:51.698 --> 18:53.266
from you guys, and you guys
are giving me therapy,

18:53.266 --> 18:54.467
and I was, like,
"I don't want therapy.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.103
I just wanna vent.
I just complain." (Laughing)

18:57.103 --> 18:58.204
I just wanna say,

18:58.204 --> 19:00.807
the one thing that I think
everybody saw in you,

19:00.807 --> 19:02.675
including the judges,
is star quality,

19:02.675 --> 19:03.876
and we all
just want you to shine.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.545
- One hundred percent.
- You're a star.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.913
Thank you.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.983
Okay, Icesis.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.384
Oh, shit.
What?

19:11.384 --> 19:12.919
(All laughing)

19:12.919 --> 19:15.221
BRAD: You started out
so quiet and focused.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.289
Yes.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.625
And then,
busted out of your shell.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.893
What changed during
the competition for you?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.729
Well, it was a couple things.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.964
I won the first challenge,
so that helped a lot.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.199
BRAD: Good.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.134
The second thing was just
talking with you judges,

19:28.134 --> 19:31.771
because I keep my drag so,
like, personal, to myself,

19:31.771 --> 19:34.774
so I was just kind of,
like, scared that, like,

19:34.774 --> 19:36.943
someone was gonna say
"You don't belong here."

19:36.943 --> 19:39.445
And then, once you guys said,
"You belong here,"

19:39.445 --> 19:41.948
I was like,
"Okay, well, let's do this."

19:41.948 --> 19:43.449
(All laughing)

19:43.449 --> 19:45.685
Well, Icesis,
you're also the oldest queen

19:45.685 --> 19:47.086
in the competition.

19:47.086 --> 19:50.890
A lot of people would say
that that is a disadvantage.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.058
Do you think that way or no?

19:52.058 --> 19:56.229
No, I never just become
complacent in my drag.

19:56.229 --> 19:59.699
I try to stay on trend,
while making it my own thing.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.801
I love drag so much

20:01.801 --> 20:03.970
that I always
want to continue to learn,

20:03.970 --> 20:05.338
and especially
from amazing people

20:05.338 --> 20:06.939
like the ones that I'm around.

20:06.939 --> 20:10.743
I'm so inspired to continue
for another hundred years.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.379
(Others laughing)

20:13.379 --> 20:15.748
- Kendall Gender.
- KENDALL: Oh, my gosh.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.051
- BRAD: Our comedy queen.
- Apparently.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.485
- GIA: Yes!
- KENDALL: Who knew?

20:19.485 --> 20:22.855
Did you ever think that you
would win the roast challenge?

20:22.855 --> 20:24.123
No.

20:24.123 --> 20:25.792
I think, when I first
started this competition,

20:25.792 --> 20:28.995
what I thought I would be
really good at, I wasn't.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.430
And I think that that's been

20:30.430 --> 20:32.465
the most
interesting part of this,

20:32.465 --> 20:33.833
because it's allowed me to play

20:33.833 --> 20:36.035
on different facets
of my personality.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.403
And, like, once I found out,

20:37.403 --> 20:38.871
like,
what I'm being celebrated for,

20:38.871 --> 20:40.339
that made me comfortable.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.141
So once we hit
that comedy challenge,

20:42.141 --> 20:43.609
I was like "Oh, bitch."

20:43.609 --> 20:46.345
- And you killed it.
- Thank you so much.

20:46.345 --> 20:47.980
- Gia Metric.
- Hey, girl.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.949
So, I have
some questions for you.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.285
- Okay.
- But, we only have an hour,

20:52.285 --> 20:53.553
so keep it short.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.155
- (Others laughing)
- GIA: Not the Oscar speech.

20:56.155 --> 20:58.591
I won't thank
The Academy tonight, hon, yes.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.992
BRAD: Okay, perfect.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.228
Well, we really know how much
you love to give a speech.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.563
Yes.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.965
So, let's take a look
at a few of our favourites.

21:05.965 --> 21:09.168
- (All laughing)
- Stop it!

21:09.168 --> 21:11.270
- Gia Metric.
- Hey, Girl.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.806
You were so eager
and willing to hit your marks.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.208
Thank you so much
for staying that.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.744
It was hard for me
to ask questions on set.

21:17.744 --> 21:22.415
I've been fighting
for this win from week one.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.717
and we made
such a fucking dope team.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.385
It's so incredible and
to hear all of you celebrate me

21:26.385 --> 21:27.854
for all my hard work
it means so much.

21:27.854 --> 21:31.424
And, I can't wait to evolve into
the next version of myself.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.658
And be brave enough
to ask enough questions

21:32.658 --> 21:35.228
so that I was doing
the right thing,

21:35.228 --> 21:37.663
and I was doing my best,
and so comfortable on set

21:37.663 --> 21:39.599
while we were stressing out.

21:39.599 --> 21:43.236
And, like, working with you
girls was just so incredible.

21:43.236 --> 21:44.637
We made such a--

21:44.637 --> 21:48.374
I feel like I am growing into
the best version of myself

21:48.374 --> 21:51.144
in this competition, and
standing here on the stage,

21:51.144 --> 21:54.313
I am so proud to be here.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.883
Obviously,
I'm critiquing myself.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.451
BRAD:
The music's playing, Gia.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.153
Shut up!
I'm almost done!

22:00.153 --> 22:01.854
- (Laughing)
- GIA: Thank you so much.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.290
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.092
Thank you all so much.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.460
Thank you so much.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.694
- Thank you, judges.
- Thanks, Gia.

22:08.694 --> 22:12.265
- Yes.
- (Others laughing)

22:12.265 --> 22:15.902
- (Laughing)
- Now's the time, yeah.

22:15.902 --> 22:19.338
(Laughing)

22:19.338 --> 22:23.176
Gia, how confident were you
coming into this competition?

22:23.176 --> 22:26.712
And did that change, having
to lip-sync in episode one?

22:26.712 --> 22:29.816
GIA: Having to lip-sync
for your life in week one,

22:29.816 --> 22:34.720
I really felt this moment
where I had to let go of fear,

22:34.720 --> 22:37.924
and I really learned to listen.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.860
I think that's where
I built my confidence.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.896
And, from week one,
to sitting here now,

22:43.896 --> 22:45.932
I feel like a completely
different person.

22:45.932 --> 22:49.669
And, I truly believe
that sitting here today,

22:49.669 --> 22:53.272
I am the best version of myself
that I have ever been.

22:53.272 --> 22:57.443
- Speaking of long speeches.
- (Others laughing)

22:57.443 --> 22:59.278
Can we add that one
to the montage?

22:59.278 --> 23:00.847
(Laughing and chattering)

23:00.847 --> 23:02.548
I was like, "That was
the short version, bitch!"

23:02.548 --> 23:05.718
- (Laughing)
- Shut up.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.587
So, you mentioned lip-synching.

23:07.587 --> 23:11.290
The only queen who hasn't
lip-synched here is Pythia.

23:11.290 --> 23:12.992
- Pythia!
- ♪ Duh-duh-duh ♪

23:12.992 --> 23:14.794
- Put on a show for us, hon.
- Yeah, please do it now.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.262
- GIA: It's your time.
- And cue the music.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.030
(All laughing)

23:18.030 --> 23:20.633
How did you manage to escape
the bottom two, Pythia?

23:20.633 --> 23:24.070
You know, I just wanted
to consistently take

23:24.070 --> 23:25.805
all the good critiques
that you guys gave me,

23:25.805 --> 23:28.908
and keep adding more, and more,
and more elements to it,

23:28.908 --> 23:30.710
and never staying,
like, stagnant.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.678
I always tried
to keep my performances,

23:32.678 --> 23:35.081
like, different so that
they wouldn't become one note.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.183
And even the smallest, little
critiques that you gave me,

23:37.183 --> 23:38.885
I would apply them.
You know what I mean?

23:38.885 --> 23:40.186
It's like,
"Turn the freak down a little.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.854
We want to see your glamour
and your personality."

23:41.854 --> 23:45.658
You know, I did that.
So, just listening and evolving.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.960
So, the Werk Room
is such a safe space,

23:47.960 --> 23:51.130
where absolutely
no topic is off limits.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.267
Let's take a look at some
of the most memorable moments.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.769
♪

23:56.769 --> 23:58.971
- STEPHANIE: Who dat?
- KIMORA: That's my son.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.774
He's always been proud
that he has a gay dad.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.776
STEPHANIE:
So, he knows you do drag.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.278
- He does, oh, yeah, he does.
- Okay.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.612
SYNTHIA:
My dad is actually gay.

24:06.612 --> 24:09.682
We were like coming out
of the closet at the same time.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.217
- What?!
- As your dad?

24:11.217 --> 24:12.485
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.153
For me, Halloween is always
a little bit different,

24:14.153 --> 24:17.390
because October 31st
is actually my sobriety date.

24:17.390 --> 24:19.859
What you see today here is not
who she was six years ago.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.628
She was not
a casual, like, drug user.

24:22.628 --> 24:26.699
There's no true opening for like
an Asian drag queen like me.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.868
You have to be type casted.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.003
So, it's always
"Okay, can you do Lucy Liu?

24:31.003 --> 24:32.405
Can you do an Asian character?"

24:32.405 --> 24:35.741
There's like this social
pressure in the gay community,

24:35.741 --> 24:37.977
not being skinny enough.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.011
KIMORA: It takes a toll,

24:39.011 --> 24:42.014
that idea
that you're not enough.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.816
My parents haven't
seen a person like me on TV.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.018
And I get to show them,
"Look, I have a family.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.920
I have friends
that love me for who I am."

24:47.920 --> 24:49.588
I was adopted.

24:49.588 --> 24:53.492
So, I never really struggled
with the culture shock.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.528
I was, like,
abandoned in the forest,

24:55.528 --> 24:58.664
and then my parents adopted me,
like, my parents appreciate--

24:58.664 --> 25:01.600
- Aw, well, thank God they did.
- So, I'm so lucky.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.802
You know, like,
"queer" is sort of like

25:02.802 --> 25:03.836
a reclaiming of the word.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.405
It's more like
about, like, liberation,

25:06.405 --> 25:09.208
and it's more political
to many different identities.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.544
I think that's, like,
when I realized that, like,

25:11.544 --> 25:15.147
I'm alone in this fight,
but I don't wanna be.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.549
Sorry, I don't--

25:16.549 --> 25:20.419
ICESIS: Okay, listen to me.
You're never gonna be alone.

25:20.419 --> 25:21.988
Okay, ever again.
I promise.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.289
- Okay?
- Aw.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.124
Aw, you sweetheart.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.792
Oh!

25:29.028 --> 25:31.163
That makeover episode
was so incredible.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.698
What did it mean to you queens?

25:32.698 --> 25:33.966
KENDALL: So emotional.

25:33.966 --> 25:37.837
It's such a, like, core part
of, like, why I do drag

25:37.837 --> 25:39.005
is like
connecting with other people.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.106
- Same.
- Agreed.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.307
KENDALL: And, like,
I'm sure all of us

25:41.307 --> 25:42.441
can feel exactly the same way.

25:42.441 --> 25:45.211
It's so vital to connect
with someone and, like,

25:45.211 --> 25:46.712
uplift them in that way,

25:46.712 --> 25:49.281
and, like, bring
this character out of them,

25:49.281 --> 25:51.183
that we get
to experience so much.

25:51.183 --> 25:53.886
Because that confidence,
it's unmatched.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.122
It was one of, like, the best
things I've ever been a part of.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.390
Yeah.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.692
BRAD: Yeah, well, there was
an amazing conversation

25:59.692 --> 26:02.762
around how everybody identifies,
and their pronouns.

26:02.762 --> 26:05.765
It was so interesting, but also,
really, really educational.

26:05.765 --> 26:09.435
What do you think the impact
of a conversation like that

26:09.435 --> 26:10.736
will be?

26:10.736 --> 26:13.072
We're not having
that conversation enough.

26:13.072 --> 26:18.044
I hadn't had it before that
episode with anyone, actually,

26:18.044 --> 26:21.347
but I learned from that,
and I am gonna have it

26:21.347 --> 26:25.084
with everyone I can,
because there's nothing worse

26:25.084 --> 26:28.421
than not feeling comfortable
when talking to someone.

26:28.421 --> 26:31.757
And I just want everyone
to be in a safe space with me,

26:31.757 --> 26:35.828
so I'll always start with
which pronouns for me to use.

26:35.828 --> 26:38.764
So, yeah, I've grown so much
from that episode.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.200
It just... it's beautiful.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.404
Being able to ask questions
that are difficult

26:45.404 --> 26:48.507
is so important for us
to be able to communicate

26:48.507 --> 26:50.576
and be able
to talk about these things.

26:50.576 --> 26:53.012
For me,
it's been extremely difficult,

26:53.012 --> 26:57.850
because you don't want
to ever disrespect someone,

26:57.850 --> 27:00.152
before you even open your mouth,

27:00.152 --> 27:02.121
and this was just a great moment

27:02.121 --> 27:04.123
to be able
to really educate ourselves

27:04.123 --> 27:05.825
in what is changing,

27:05.825 --> 27:06.959
and what's happening
in the world now.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.194
Mm, I agree.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.696
I have a question
for each of the final four.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.331
- Yes?
- BRAD: Kendall Gender.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.632
That's me.

27:13.632 --> 27:17.103
What would you say was
your "a-ha moment" this season,

27:17.103 --> 27:21.240
the moment where you knew you
were going to get to the end?

27:21.240 --> 27:23.509
Oh, well,
I'm gonna have a sip of AHA

27:23.509 --> 27:24.877
and really
put myself in the mood.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.846
(Others laughing)

27:26.846 --> 27:28.147
Mm!

27:28.147 --> 27:29.915
In all seriousness,
I think it was the trajectory

27:29.915 --> 27:31.617
after lip-synching.

27:31.617 --> 27:34.019
It really, like, shook me up,

27:34.019 --> 27:36.188
and I was, like,
"Either it's gonna be over,

27:36.188 --> 27:40.292
and that's what happens, or,
I can kick myself in the ass,

27:40.292 --> 27:42.228
and really try to take
it to the next level."

27:42.228 --> 27:44.830
And I was like,
"I deserve to be here."

27:44.830 --> 27:47.900
BRAD: Gia Metric,
what was your a-ha moment

27:47.900 --> 27:48.934
of the season?

27:48.934 --> 27:50.536
It was actually
the week of the roast

27:50.536 --> 27:51.837
where my insecurities,

27:51.837 --> 27:54.573
my fears,
my anxieties actually resurfaced

27:54.573 --> 27:56.041
because I was very uncomfortable

27:56.041 --> 27:57.243
in the situation.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.678
And the a-ha moment, for me,

27:59.678 --> 28:02.681
was looking myself
in the mirror,

28:02.681 --> 28:05.117
and literally just saying, like,

28:05.117 --> 28:08.420
"You're human, and
you are worthy of being here."

28:08.420 --> 28:12.858
It made me feel capable.
I feel so lucky to be here.

28:12.858 --> 28:13.959
(Laughing)

28:13.959 --> 28:15.161
BRAD: Well,
we're happy you're here.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.695
- Icesis Couture.
- ICESIS: Uh-huh?

28:16.695 --> 28:18.464
BRAD: What was your a-ha moment?

28:18.464 --> 28:20.032
ICESIS:
It was the second episode.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.201
I had just come off from a win,

28:22.201 --> 28:24.470
and, like,
being put in the bottom,

28:24.470 --> 28:26.772
like, having it
almost taken away from me,

28:26.772 --> 28:29.208
and you guys being, like,
"Literally, your only problem

28:29.208 --> 28:30.809
is you're in your fucking head."

28:30.809 --> 28:33.078
And I've accomplished things
that I didn't think I could do,

28:33.078 --> 28:36.115
just because you guys sat there

28:36.115 --> 28:38.083
and told me to just
literally snap out of it.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.485
Aw, I love that.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.620
Brad, you destroy me.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.322
When you're sitting
up there crying, I can't.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.591
"He's crying just for me.
It's just for me."

28:45.591 --> 28:47.693
(All laughing)

28:47.693 --> 28:50.863
I literally, last week,
I was a disaster.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.498
You're always a disaster.

28:52.498 --> 28:55.935
(All laughing)

28:55.935 --> 28:57.937
Ah!

28:57.937 --> 29:00.673
KIMORA: Oh, I hate you!
- (All laughing)

29:00.673 --> 29:03.642
BRAD: Pythia,
what was your a-ha moment?

29:03.642 --> 29:06.445
If I'm being honest,
I survived the Snatch Game,

29:06.445 --> 29:09.014
and I was in the top for it,
and I am just, like,

29:09.014 --> 29:10.482
that moment, I was like...
You know what?

29:10.482 --> 29:12.151
Because you guys telling me
"No, you're funny.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.553
You belong here.
You are... like, you're a star."

29:14.553 --> 29:15.788
Like, it just
really made me believe

29:15.788 --> 29:17.189
that I can make it all the way,

29:17.189 --> 29:19.291
and I'm here,
so I'm very, very proud.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.392
So...

29:20.392 --> 29:21.493
BRAD:
We're super proud of you too

29:21.493 --> 29:22.695
Oh, my God.
I love you so much.

29:22.695 --> 29:23.729
Aw, look at them.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.531
- (Others laughing)
- Oh, my God!

29:25.531 --> 29:28.334
- So far away!
- Fuck y'all.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.802
Fuck y'all, bitches.

29:29.802 --> 29:31.770
- That means a lot for real.
- I know.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.005
- Stephanie!
- STEPHANIE: What?

29:33.005 --> 29:35.507
- Oh, here we go.
- (Others laughing)

29:35.507 --> 29:38.477
- She said "What?"
- (All chattering and laughing)

29:38.477 --> 29:40.479
BRAD: Well, you've always
been very opinionated.

29:40.479 --> 29:41.981
You've had
strong opinions on everyone.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.082
Am I?
No!

29:43.082 --> 29:44.917
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.386
But, since you missed
the reading challenge,

29:47.386 --> 29:50.122
we thought that we would
offer you a chance...

29:50.122 --> 29:51.657
(Cheering)

29:51.657 --> 29:53.492
BRAD:
..to read your fellow queens.

29:53.492 --> 29:54.793
- Ooh!
- Yes!

29:54.793 --> 29:56.362
STEPHANIE:
Do you have the glasses?

29:56.362 --> 29:57.696
EVE:
You were born for this, baby.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.999
You know, you can read
the other girls over there too,

29:59.999 --> 30:01.267
- right?
- (All laughing and chattering)

30:01.267 --> 30:02.935
No, no, no, no, no,
we're sharing the wealth.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.703
We're sharing the wealth.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.839
ICESIS: Somebody take
the glasses from her, please.

30:06.839 --> 30:07.840
Yeah.

30:07.840 --> 30:11.644
Kendall Gender,
in drag, Beyoncé, sure,

30:11.644 --> 30:12.845
out of drag, Jay-Z.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.947
(Laughing and screaming)

30:14.947 --> 30:16.515
I've been called Drake.
I've been called Jay-Z.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.717
- GIA: Obama.
- I'll take it.

30:18.717 --> 30:20.286
EVE: Icons only.

30:20.286 --> 30:24.523
Gia Metric, the only reason
why you won that first lip-sync

30:24.523 --> 30:26.959
is because it was easy.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.627
That was a read to you, Beth.

30:28.627 --> 30:29.795
- (Laughing)
- I was like...

30:29.795 --> 30:31.830
Not the clarification.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.867
Suki Doll,
your name is very fitting.

30:34.867 --> 30:37.069
"Doll" because you're
the Asian version of Annabelle.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.470
(Laughing)

30:38.470 --> 30:41.073
- Not Annabelle!
- SUKI: Give it back.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.542
- Bye!
- (All screaming)

30:43.542 --> 30:45.744
EVE: Oh, my gosh!
Ka-boom.

30:45.744 --> 30:48.080
BRAD:
Queens, you've been amazing,

30:48.080 --> 30:51.116
but one of you
has been extra congenial.

30:51.116 --> 30:52.885
Oh!

30:52.885 --> 30:55.354
The winner
of Miss Congeniality...

30:55.354 --> 30:56.622
- Oh, my God!
- (Screaming)

30:56.622 --> 31:01.060
..will win a $1000 gift
certificate from our friends

31:01.060 --> 31:02.761
- at Wigs And Grace...
- QUEENS: Ooh!

31:02.761 --> 31:04.763
Oh, yes!
We love it.

31:04.763 --> 31:07.833
BRAD: ...and $2000 worth
of drag jewels,

31:07.833 --> 31:10.235
courtesy of Amped Accessories.

31:10.235 --> 31:11.637
- Oh!
- Come on!

31:11.637 --> 31:13.038
KENDALL:
Come through.

31:13.038 --> 31:17.209
BRAD: You all voted, and,
Canada's Drag Race season two

31:17.209 --> 31:19.812
Miss Congeniality is...

31:19.812 --> 31:22.081
Ah!
So exciting!

31:22.081 --> 31:24.483
♪

31:24.483 --> 31:25.517
..Suki Doll!

31:25.517 --> 31:29.221
(Cheering and applauding)

31:29.221 --> 31:30.656
- Yay!
- Yay!

31:30.656 --> 31:32.991
- Yay, Suki Doll!
- SUKI: I love you, girls.

31:32.991 --> 31:34.460
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

31:34.460 --> 31:37.796
Honestly, you girls made this
experience so fucking unique.

31:37.796 --> 31:40.299
There was a lot of drama, and
that's what drag queens are,

31:40.299 --> 31:41.600
but at the end of the day,

31:41.600 --> 31:45.137
I can tell how genuine
each one of you are, except you.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.306
- No, I'm kidding.
- (Others laughing)

31:47.306 --> 31:49.074
I don't have to be
congenial anymore.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.910
- She broke her prize.
- Let loose, babe.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.812
SUKI: Each one of you guys,
you're so unique,

31:53.812 --> 31:56.615
and I hope you enjoyed,
you know, as much as I did,

31:56.615 --> 31:58.317
like, the whole process,
and knowing each other,

31:58.317 --> 32:01.887
and helping each other,
trying to sleep with each other.

32:01.887 --> 32:03.489
(Others laughing)

32:03.489 --> 32:06.225
- We love you, Suki!
- Yeah, bravo!

32:06.225 --> 32:08.994
I love you girls so much.
Muah!

32:08.994 --> 32:11.363
Now that Miss Congeniality
has been named,

32:11.363 --> 32:14.933
let's shift the spotlight
back to who will be crowned

32:14.933 --> 32:18.871
Canada's next drag superstar.

32:18.871 --> 32:21.840
Queens,
who do we think will win?

32:21.840 --> 32:25.310
Oh, damn!
Okay, here we go!

32:25.310 --> 32:28.213
- Not Kimora!
- Oh, my goodness!

32:28.213 --> 32:31.316
Let's go down the line.
Starting with Beth.

32:31.316 --> 32:34.319
I really think Icesis
deserves this title.

32:34.319 --> 32:36.455
She's really proven herself
in this competition.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.623
Océane?

32:37.623 --> 32:40.759
I would say, um,
of course, my sister, Icesis,

32:40.759 --> 32:43.228
but it's not
maybe objective enough.

32:43.228 --> 32:44.730
No, no.
You can just stop there.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.533
- (Others laughing)
- ICESIS: Just stop there.

32:47.533 --> 32:48.667
Stephanie?

32:48.667 --> 32:50.769
I'm definitely
rooting for Pythia.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.038
I actually do see myself
a lot with you,

32:53.038 --> 32:54.139
even though you're older.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.841
- (Laughing)
- STEPHANIE: We can tell.

32:55.841 --> 32:57.576
I'm only 24.

32:57.576 --> 32:58.744
It's not another
reading challenge.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.312
There's a compliment
in there somewhere.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.281
KIMORA: Somewhere.
Dig deep.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.849
Miss Congeniality, Suki?

33:03.849 --> 33:05.184
Being the queen
and having the crown,

33:05.184 --> 33:07.553
setting new standards
for our drag community,

33:07.553 --> 33:09.488
Pythia, Icesis.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.956
I'm biased.
They're look queens.

33:10.956 --> 33:12.624
(Laughing)

33:12.624 --> 33:14.226
Eve 6000?

33:14.226 --> 33:16.728
Kendall, like,
your activism is something

33:16.728 --> 33:18.464
that resonates with me,
like, so deeply,

33:18.464 --> 33:21.200
and, I think it would
be so important for you

33:21.200 --> 33:24.369
to have that platform to be able
to carry that to everyone.

33:24.369 --> 33:27.306
And, Gia, you are probably the
most driven bitch in the room.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.540
Mm-hm.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.042
EVE: Like, you can
lip-sync and just kill it,

33:30.042 --> 33:31.944
and fucking continue on,
and win.

33:31.944 --> 33:36.281
And Pythia is, like, my one,

33:36.281 --> 33:39.585
because we connected
on something so emotional.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.087
Seeing someone that comes
from the same thing,

33:42.087 --> 33:44.056
and--
(Crying)

33:44.056 --> 33:48.460
Oh, my God.
Sorry.

33:48.460 --> 33:49.995
It's a lot of emotion for safe.

33:49.995 --> 33:53.665
- Okay, um...
- (Others laughing)

33:53.665 --> 33:55.434
But, no, seeing Pythia,

33:55.434 --> 33:58.904
knowing that we went through
almost the exact same thing,

33:58.904 --> 34:01.440
and having her,
like, rise above it in this way,

34:01.440 --> 34:03.108
it makes me so proud to see you.

34:03.108 --> 34:05.878
I just... I would love
to see the crown on your head.

34:05.878 --> 34:07.479
Synthia Kiss?

34:07.479 --> 34:09.982
Seriously, I'd be so excited
to see any of you win,

34:09.982 --> 34:12.017
especially my brat pack girls,

34:12.017 --> 34:16.989
but as far as who got my mind
so inspired leaving, Pythia.

34:16.989 --> 34:18.457
BRAD: Kimora Amour?

34:18.457 --> 34:20.926
It's hard for me to pick,
so I'm just gonna go

34:20.926 --> 34:24.296
based on just track record
of mini challenge wins

34:24.296 --> 34:27.633
and overall wins,
and that's just Icesis.

34:27.633 --> 34:30.402
But when it comes
to who deserves the crown,

34:30.402 --> 34:32.037
Pythia, bitch.
