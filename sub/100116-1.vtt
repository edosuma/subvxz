WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.568
Previously onLegacies... My name is Hope Mikaelson.

00:03.612 --> 00:05.179
The school behind these gates

00:05.222 --> 00:07.007
protects the secrets
of people like me.

00:07.050 --> 00:10.445
Vampires, werewolves, witches
and everything in between.

00:10.488 --> 00:11.794
What happened? ALARIC: Landon took a knife.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.578
Now monsters
that shouldn't exist

00:13.622 --> 00:15.798
have been coming after it
ever since.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.582
LANDON: What's Malivore? HOPE: It's a hell dimension

00:17.626 --> 00:19.193
that consumes creatures
and wipes their existence

00:19.236 --> 00:20.803
from the collective conscience.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.110
Dad? Do you think I'm broken?

00:23.153 --> 00:24.676
ALARIC:
There's something
that happens to twins

00:24.720 --> 00:25.895
like you and Josie.

00:25.938 --> 00:26.939
When you turn 22,

00:26.983 --> 00:28.550
the Gemini must merge.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.291
JOSIE:
So, one of us
is gonna have to kill

00:30.334 --> 00:32.249
the other one?I failed you.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.077
The honor council
will convene to decide

00:34.121 --> 00:36.036
whether I should remain

00:36.079 --> 00:37.211
as your headmaster.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.995
MG:
I can't control it.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.694
ALARIC: We've been wondering
if he's supernatural.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.306
You ever heard
of the legend of the phoenix?

00:45.349 --> 00:46.698
RAFAEL:
I can't control myself.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.439
Use this. Only catch is,

00:48.483 --> 00:50.180
you can't turn yourself back.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.052
Our father is Malivore,

00:52.095 --> 00:54.097
the most powerful monster
ever to walk the Earth.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.838
Ourfather?

00:55.881 --> 00:57.622
HOPE: And now Malivore's gonna
rise unless I stop him.

00:57.666 --> 00:58.971
Because once I toss myself
into that pit,

00:59.015 --> 01:00.843
no one at school
will remember me,

01:00.886 --> 01:01.974
including you.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.735
Over there.

01:23.779 --> 01:26.086
Hi, little brother.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.349
Have a great summer, guys.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.612
See you in September.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.572
LANDON:
At the Salvatore School,

01:34.616 --> 01:35.921
the end of the year means
different things

01:35.965 --> 01:37.488
to different people.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.316
For some it's about reunions.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.753
To others
it means saying goodbye.

01:41.797 --> 01:45.105
Summer is a time to set out
on new adventures,

01:45.148 --> 01:48.412
see the world, to grow
in ways you never imagined.

01:48.456 --> 01:49.892
Everyone moves on.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.067
Milton.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.157
Except for those
who have nowhere to go,

01:54.201 --> 01:55.376
the ones like me.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.073
My name is Landon Kirby.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.207
All I've ever wanted to know
is where I come from,

02:00.250 --> 02:04.646
to have a home, a family,
to be special.

02:05.473 --> 02:07.953
Recently, I got all of it.

02:07.997 --> 02:11.653
So why do I feel
like nothing's changed?

02:11.696 --> 02:14.830
Somehow it feels
like the most important piece

02:14.873 --> 02:16.962
of my life is missing.

02:17.006 --> 02:19.095
I know I need to keep searching for answers

02:19.139 --> 02:20.444
because as far as I can tell,

02:20.488 --> 02:22.751
being immortal means
being alone.

02:23.534 --> 02:26.668
And being alone is...

02:26.711 --> 02:28.713
hopeless.

02:41.073 --> 02:44.033
JOSIE: Mom didn't tell you anything else about this thing?

02:44.076 --> 02:46.122
LIZZIE: Only that it's called
an Ascendant,

02:46.166 --> 02:48.907
and you and I made it with
Aunt Bonnie when we were five.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.996
Does it have anything
to do with the Merge?

02:51.040 --> 02:52.172
I don't know.

02:52.215 --> 02:55.349
She's being cagey about it. I...

03:01.268 --> 03:03.400
Sorry. Mom almost busted me.

03:03.444 --> 03:06.490
You know, we can Facechat
like normal people.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.318
We aren't normal.

03:08.362 --> 03:11.147
And we need to keep our magic
sharp over the summer.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.193
How is therapy going?Fine.

03:13.236 --> 03:16.239
There is this sexy Swedish guy

03:16.283 --> 03:17.893
whose session is
after me on Tuesdays.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.851
I think he's Swedish.
Maybe Polish.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.026
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.202
He is hot

03:22.245 --> 03:23.551
and crazy,

03:23.594 --> 03:25.248
and the language barrier
will make it impossible

03:25.292 --> 03:27.294
for us to communicate.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.860
Just how I like it.

03:28.904 --> 03:31.036
You should really work on that.I'll add it

03:31.080 --> 03:33.909
to the list of broken pieces
to glue together.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.258
What about you?

03:35.302 --> 03:37.695
Any hot summer dates?

03:37.739 --> 03:38.957
Dad's been, like,
my life plus-one

03:39.001 --> 03:41.003
ever since he got
the headmaster boot.

03:41.046 --> 03:43.701
I honestly think he's going
through a midlife crisis.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.356
Gross. Hair growth?Bushy.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.576
Lady prospects?Lacking.

03:49.838 --> 03:52.144
Are you not having
any fun at all?

03:52.188 --> 03:53.276
What about

03:53.320 --> 03:54.538
Wee Willie Winkle?

03:54.582 --> 03:58.107
Landon's been keeping
to himself mostly.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.630
He's always off with Raf.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.458
So ditch it all
and come to Europe.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.721
I can't.
I don't want to leave Dad alone.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.549
I'm honestly kind of worried
he's gonna go out

04:05.593 --> 04:07.072
and buy a tiny red car.

04:07.116 --> 04:11.076
I thought we were taking strides
to be less codependent.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.469
We are.

04:12.513 --> 04:15.298
But there's codependent
and then there's leaving Dad

04:15.342 --> 04:17.561
with his alarming
mustache growth.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.259
Oh, gross.
Yeah.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.752
DORIAN:
Can I help you?

04:34.796 --> 04:37.277
It's me, Dorian.

04:42.717 --> 04:45.415
So how is
the headmaster search going?

04:45.459 --> 04:46.764
Caroline's narrowing it down.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.940
I really appreciate
you loaning me this stuff.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.073
I'm headed to Georgia tomorrow.
I'm gonna do another round

04:51.116 --> 04:53.031
of forensic testing
on the Malivore pit.

04:53.075 --> 04:56.470
If I learn anything new,
I'll-I'll let you know.

05:02.998 --> 05:06.610
I know I may have
gotten heated over the vote.

05:06.654 --> 05:07.785
You did.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.135
Yeah, okay,
I probably overreacted.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.615
You may have.Well, I just
wasn't expecting

05:11.659 --> 05:14.314
that you'd keep
your vote a secret.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.664
It was a secret ballot, Ric.:
Yeah.

05:16.707 --> 05:21.059
Of course. But between you,
Josie, Kaleb and Jed voting,

05:21.103 --> 05:23.758
I'm still wondering
how three to one happened.

05:23.801 --> 05:27.022
Yeah, I just assumed I
could count on your vote.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.807
Good luck, Ric.

05:29.851 --> 05:33.028
I really hope you find
what you're looking for.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.382
LANDON:
Dr. Saltzman.
Long time no see.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.557
I see Raf

05:40.601 --> 05:42.124
is eating better than I am.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.300
Yeah, well, you get stuck
in permanent wolf form,

05:44.344 --> 05:46.476
and you, too, can hit
the all-you-can-eat meat buffet.

05:46.520 --> 05:50.001
Yeah. Any luck finding
a spell to turn him back?

05:50.045 --> 05:52.003
I'm working on it.
Any luck figuring out

05:52.047 --> 05:54.397
why I can't remember destroying
the Malivore pit?

05:54.441 --> 05:56.225
I'm working on it.

05:56.268 --> 05:58.793
Everything else good?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.098
Totally.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.839
Here's to success.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.364
Yeah.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.844
KALEB:
Yes.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.846
Sing to me, baby.
That's what I like to hear.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.196
Sing to me like a vamp
without his Daylight Ring

06:11.240 --> 06:13.590
on a hot Georgia summer day.

06:13.634 --> 06:14.678
Mmm.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.594
You're supposed to
be taking notes.

06:17.638 --> 06:18.682
â™ª Back to life...

06:18.726 --> 06:19.857
Didn't seem necessary

06:19.901 --> 06:21.990
with you narrating
the whole deal.

06:22.033 --> 06:25.733
Narration goes one way. What
you heard was a conversation.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.474
With your meat?Meat's got a name,

06:27.517 --> 06:29.084
okay, same as you.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.868
This is Gertrude.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.958
My crazy Uncle Earl, he owns
a farm outside the city.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.265
I was there
the day she was born.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.397
That's dark, dude.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.181
It's the circle of life, man.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.487
All natural.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.880
What ain't natural
is you over there pouting.

06:42.924 --> 06:45.317
If you say so.No, I know so.

06:45.361 --> 06:46.623
Look, you're
about to have

06:46.667 --> 06:49.191
the best summer
of your life. All right?

06:49.234 --> 06:51.846
I appreciate everything that
you're doing for me, Kaleb.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.457
I really do. But it doesn't
change the fact

06:54.501 --> 06:56.198
that I miss my family,

06:56.241 --> 06:57.721
even if they suck.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.593
Or that I went
full superhero

06:59.636 --> 07:01.508
and then school ended
just when Lizzie Saltzman

07:01.551 --> 07:02.683
thought I was cool.Oh.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.336
We don't say that name, okay?

07:04.380 --> 07:06.991
Don't even fix your mouth
to say Li-- none of that.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.210
Okay?

07:08.253 --> 07:10.081
It's like I was saying before,

07:10.125 --> 07:11.648
I'm your family now.

07:11.692 --> 07:14.085
Which means that my family
is your family, too.

07:14.129 --> 07:17.915
Which also means
that you must start practicing

07:17.959 --> 07:20.440
for the cook-off that happens
on this rooftop

07:20.483 --> 07:21.745
every Fourth of July.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.051
Because this year,

07:23.094 --> 07:25.314
we're beating my crazy-ass uncle
at his own game.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.489
All right?

07:26.533 --> 07:27.925
Okay.
Okay.

07:27.969 --> 07:31.494
Now you take
some fresh animal blood.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.238
Take in this gorgeous view.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.022
â™ª I come back to life...

07:38.066 --> 07:40.460
Take a deep breath.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.766
â™ª But that ain't gonna work,
no... â™ª

07:42.810 --> 07:44.594
Yeah.

07:44.638 --> 07:47.249
Best summer of our lives.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.512
Yeah, bro.

07:49.556 --> 07:53.124
â™ª I come back to life...

07:53.168 --> 07:54.604
Mmm. Mmm.

07:54.648 --> 07:57.651
Oh, that's straight Gertrude
right there.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.479
Yeah, yeah,
that-that's her.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.488
I suck at this.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.319
My best friend used to say

08:14.363 --> 08:18.802
he'd rather starve than eat
anything I tried to make, but...

08:20.848 --> 08:23.067
...you already know that.

08:25.461 --> 08:27.071
That's good.

08:34.209 --> 08:37.691
I know you're in there, Raf.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.214
I'm gonna find a way
to get you back,

08:39.257 --> 08:41.521
and then everything
will be good again, okay?

08:43.784 --> 08:45.220
I'll never give up hope.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.105
Hello?

09:13.509 --> 09:16.686
Post tenebras spero lucem.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.372
Fancy meeting you here.

09:56.247 --> 09:59.033
Whoa. What the hell
are you doing here?

09:59.076 --> 10:00.774
Saving your life, obviously.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.514
No. I'm supposed
to be in-in peace.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.821
Okay, you are not peace.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.562
In fact, you're the opposite
of peace.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.086
So, where are we?

10:09.913 --> 10:12.612
Come on. Do the math.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.179
It's not that simple. Okay,
there are freaky cyclones

10:15.223 --> 10:18.705
and blinding lights
and you're here...

10:18.748 --> 10:21.882
Oh, my God, we're in hell.

10:21.925 --> 10:25.494
No such thing. I think.

10:25.537 --> 10:26.669
Go on.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.150
Take your best guess.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.325
No.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.935
Why not?

10:31.979 --> 10:33.458
Because I'm not gonna give you

10:33.502 --> 10:35.809
the satisfaction
of telling me that I failed.

10:37.506 --> 10:40.335
You mean you don't want to
hear you're in the Blackness?

10:40.378 --> 10:43.294
That you've been
consumed by Malivore?
No.

10:43.338 --> 10:47.255
You don't want me to point out
that all your romantic heroics

10:47.298 --> 10:48.430
were for nada?

10:48.473 --> 10:49.953
That the big bad
lives to see

10:49.997 --> 10:52.042
another day and
all your friends

10:52.086 --> 10:55.089
have forgotten
you ever existed?

10:55.132 --> 10:56.525
Stop talking.If I were you,

10:56.568 --> 10:58.135
I'd make peace with that.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.181
Hope.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.922
Wait.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.664
I can help you.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.580
I don't see how.

11:08.624 --> 11:11.496
I spent years inside this place,

11:11.540 --> 11:15.370
and while you cannonballing
into the belly of Malivore

11:15.413 --> 11:16.719
didn't seem to destroy him,

11:16.763 --> 11:19.330
it has changed things,

11:19.374 --> 11:24.031
so stop being a dick to me
and maybe I'll elaborate.

11:24.074 --> 11:27.208
Okay. I'm partially listening.

11:27.251 --> 11:30.341
Every creature
consumed by my father

11:30.385 --> 11:33.823
used to exist here
in total isolation,

11:33.867 --> 11:36.696
but here we are,
talking to each other.

11:36.739 --> 11:40.569
Your presence here
has somehow opened

11:40.612 --> 11:42.571
the cell doors.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.181
If it can do that,

11:44.225 --> 11:47.489
maybe there's a way
for us to escape.

11:47.532 --> 11:50.753
So what do you say?

11:53.538 --> 11:54.801
Partners?

11:54.844 --> 11:56.716
Pass.

11:58.065 --> 12:01.285
You are such a child.
No wonder you failed.

12:01.329 --> 12:04.767
Says the guy whose entire life
has been about failing Daddy.

12:04.811 --> 12:08.553
I don't trust you, okay?
And I never will.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.599
You're the one
who brought me into this mess.

12:10.642 --> 12:13.733
If you'd just let me meat-puppet
my loser little brother,

12:13.776 --> 12:14.908
then we wouldn't even be in...

12:14.951 --> 12:16.736
Imitantor pupulis.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.128
Not again.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.308
Your old friend,
the mimic spell.

12:25.440 --> 12:30.053
You will do anything
I intend you to do,

12:30.097 --> 12:32.403
and it is
my intention

12:32.447 --> 12:36.146
that this is the last
conversation we will ever have.

12:36.190 --> 12:39.280
If I were you,
I'd make peace with that.

12:51.161 --> 12:54.338
So I should probably tell you
I moved rooms last month.

12:54.382 --> 12:58.342
Ours was getting painted,
and I figured I'd move back in

12:58.386 --> 13:01.084
once you were,
you know, you again.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.652
But if for any reason
you become you while I'm out,

13:03.695 --> 13:07.308
like, looking for ways to help
you become you, I just didn't

13:07.351 --> 13:09.919
want you to go back and see that
I wasn't in our room anymore

13:09.963 --> 13:11.616
and think that I bailed on you,

13:11.660 --> 13:14.315
because I would never do that,
obviously.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.930
And this ain't so bad, right?

13:20.974 --> 13:22.497
I mean, I know it's taking
a lot longer for us

13:22.540 --> 13:24.847
to get you out of this mess
than we both hoped, but...

13:26.153 --> 13:28.503
...you got your own wolf den.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.854
We do movie nights.

13:35.162 --> 13:37.947
Happy Fourth of July, buddy.

13:41.429 --> 13:44.084
ALARIC:
No matter what path I go down,
it seems like a dead end.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.129
I mean, there were at least
two other people with Landon

13:46.173 --> 13:47.957
the night Malivore
was destroyed.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.220
They left fibers,
footprints, hair.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.656
I just don't know
who they were.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.180
Isn't that the point?
If somebody went into

13:53.223 --> 13:55.051
the Malivore pit, they'd
be erased from our memories.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.487
Yeah, well, that's
what's haunting me.

13:56.531 --> 13:57.706
Who have we
forgotten?

13:57.749 --> 13:59.360
It couldn't have been
anybody we've known.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.057
There'd be
keepsakes, photos,

14:01.101 --> 14:02.537
an empty bed somewhere.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.018
Well, whoever they were,
they were important to somebody.

14:06.889 --> 14:07.977
So, Dad, I was
actually hoping

14:08.021 --> 14:10.501
we could talk
about the Ascendant,

14:10.545 --> 14:13.374
what it has to do
with the Merge.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.856
Wait, is that Landon
right there?

14:22.122 --> 14:24.298
LANDON:
I've had my head
buried in books for weeks,

14:24.341 --> 14:26.909
nothing on how to turn
a wolf back into a human.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.433
I keep hitting
dead end after dead end.

14:29.477 --> 14:32.262
Join the club.
Hey.

14:32.306 --> 14:36.049
Landon, can you ask my dad
why he won't give me answers

14:36.092 --> 14:38.051
to my very simple questions

14:38.094 --> 14:41.271
on how my sister and I
can survive past the age of 22?

14:41.315 --> 14:42.359
That's because your dad
doesn't have

14:42.403 --> 14:43.665
any answers
he's able to give you.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.841
That's why, sweetheart.Able to or willing?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.235
Look, there is nothing about
the Ascendant you need to know.

14:48.278 --> 14:51.238
Then why do you flinch
every time I bring it up?

14:51.281 --> 14:53.196
Because it has nothing to do
with the Merge, Josette,

14:53.240 --> 14:55.068
so let's just drop it, okay?

14:57.940 --> 14:59.724
I'm gonna head back to campus.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.552
Whoa, what about
the fireworks?

15:01.596 --> 15:03.119
Oh, I'm worried
they might scare Raf.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.947
You know,
I don't want him to be alone.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.341
I'll come with you.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.734
I'm suddenly not in the mood
to celebrate anything,

15:09.778 --> 15:11.954
much less
independence.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.002
â™ª Tell me what you want
from me, boy... â™ª

15:16.045 --> 15:18.787
Okay, Daisy,
today's the big day,

15:18.830 --> 15:20.963
so think tender thoughts.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.965
Embrace this dry rub,
become one with it,

15:23.009 --> 15:24.924
and thanks for, like,

15:24.967 --> 15:27.143
dying for us and stuff,
you know?

15:27.187 --> 15:28.405
You talking to your meat?

15:28.449 --> 15:30.016
â™ª Why don'â€™t you just
let me heal ya? â™ª

15:30.059 --> 15:32.757
Nah, that'd, that'd,
that'd be weird, right?

15:32.801 --> 15:36.718
Be weird if you didn't.
A great steak's like a plant.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.763
You love on it and it shows.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.461
â™ª You hurt me...

15:41.462 --> 15:43.377
What should I say?

15:43.420 --> 15:46.293
Well, you can start
by telling me your name.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.730
Milton.

15:48.773 --> 15:51.602
Your daddy hate you
or something?

15:51.646 --> 15:55.867
Not until recently,
but my friends call me MG.

15:55.911 --> 15:58.958
Huh.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.569
Then it's nice to meet you,
Milton.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.007
It's time to flip Daisy.

16:05.051 --> 16:08.141
You can tell
by the color of the smoke,

16:08.184 --> 16:10.056
like when they're
electing a new pope.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.884
â™ª You're pushing me 'round...

16:12.928 --> 16:15.713
Okay. All right.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.319
CLARKE:
Hope.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.191
We can work this out.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.757
Don't do this to me.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.151
Listen to me,

17:02.195 --> 17:04.153
whatever this is,
it's gonna destroy you.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.329
It'll rip you apart.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.941
Please break the spell
so I can help you.

17:09.985 --> 17:11.639
Hope!

17:25.609 --> 17:27.089
You're welcome.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.352
Oh, crap.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.832
Not exactly
what I was expecting...

17:32.747 --> 17:34.227
Oh, crap.
Run.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.342
I changed my mind
about the fireworks.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.527
It's not a big deal.

18:13.570 --> 18:14.745
Who do you think
you're talking to?

18:14.789 --> 18:16.007
My sister is
the queen of self-harm.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.400
I know it when I see it.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.881
I'm not harming myself
because I can't be harmed.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.404
That's the point.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.058
Where, in any of your
phoenix research, does it say

18:23.102 --> 18:25.756
that the number of times that
you can resurrect is infinite?

18:25.800 --> 18:27.410
Where does it say it isn't?

18:27.454 --> 18:29.108
Hurting yourself
doesn't make anything better.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.718
It never does.

18:30.761 --> 18:32.198
You're right. Maybe I should
focus on other people's problems

18:32.241 --> 18:33.460
instead of my own.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.766
That's not what I'm doing.That's a lie.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.028
How do you know?

18:37.072 --> 18:39.161
Because when you lie
as often as I used to,

18:39.205 --> 18:41.424
you develop a gut feeling.

18:41.468 --> 18:45.124
I just know.Okay.

18:46.212 --> 18:49.171
What are we supposed to do?

18:49.215 --> 18:52.043
You tell me.

18:52.087 --> 18:55.177
Because, to be honest with you,
I'm kind of at a loss.

19:00.835 --> 19:04.143
Maybe we should both stop
worrying so much about dying.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.842
Start living a little?

19:27.905 --> 19:29.951
â™ª My name is
Yum Yum, gimme some â™ª

19:29.994 --> 19:32.780
â™ª My name is Yum Yum,
gimme some â™ª

19:32.823 --> 19:34.434
â™ª My name is
Yum Yum, gimme some â™ª

19:34.477 --> 19:37.176
â™ª My name is Yum Yum,
gimme some... â™ª

19:39.003 --> 19:41.528
Oh. Mm.Hey, Kaleb.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.925
Relax, Special K.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.319
It's just barbecue.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.930
Now, look here, I stood by you

19:52.974 --> 19:54.932
when I thought you murdered
one of our friends.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.934
Okay.
But you say something
stupid like that again,

19:56.978 --> 19:58.022
we ain't brothers, man.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.067
Okay.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.199
KALEB:
Damn.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.113
Another vote
for my creepy-ass uncle.

20:02.157 --> 20:05.595
I'm Earl.

20:05.639 --> 20:06.770
Uh,

20:06.814 --> 20:09.338
Milton, Milton Greasley.That's right.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.861
I heard about you.

20:10.905 --> 20:11.732
Good things, I hope.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.474
Yeah, bloodsucker, all good.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.348
You got his ass.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.699
Hey, I tried your meat.

20:22.743 --> 20:25.398
Yeah?
Solid second place.

20:25.441 --> 20:28.270
See you on the podium.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.751
Yeah, but this time
you'll be looking up.

20:35.103 --> 20:37.584
Do you really think
we can win?

20:37.627 --> 20:41.588
Hell no, man. I know we can.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.808
It's like I've been saying:
best summer ever.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.288
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.Look at this.

20:46.332 --> 20:50.379
Um, about that,
I may have found someone.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.990
That's what's up. Yeah.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.383
She here?
Yeah.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.603
Oh, which one?Uh, orange top.

21:05.786 --> 21:06.917
Boom.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.963
Best summer...

21:09.006 --> 21:10.269
Never.

21:11.139 --> 21:12.749
You're talking about Kym?

21:12.793 --> 21:14.229
Is-is that her,
is that her name?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.796
MG, are you kidding me?

21:15.839 --> 21:17.885
I've told you
a million stories about Kym.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.408
Kym. I...

21:19.452 --> 21:21.105
Your sister?

21:22.629 --> 21:26.633
Th-The who was away, building
houses for homeless people?

21:26.676 --> 21:29.026
And without all of that...Mm-hmm.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.595
Look, man,

21:32.639 --> 21:35.294
have all the summer fun
you want.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.383
Just don't be having it
with her.

21:42.126 --> 21:43.563
â™ª Love is the answer

21:43.606 --> 21:45.434
â™ª At least for most
of the questions in my heart â™ª

21:45.478 --> 21:46.740
â™ª Like "Why are we here?"

21:46.783 --> 21:48.307
â™ª And "Where do we go?"

21:48.350 --> 21:49.873
â™ª And "How come it's so hard?"

21:49.917 --> 21:52.093
â™ª It's not always easy
and sometimes â™ª

21:52.136 --> 21:54.269
â™ª Life can be deceiving

21:54.313 --> 21:55.749
â™ª I'll tell you one thing

21:55.792 --> 21:59.143
â™ª It's always better
when we're together â™ª

21:59.187 --> 22:04.061
â™ª Mmm, it's always better
when we're together â™ª

22:04.105 --> 22:07.587
â™ª Yeah, we'll look at the stars
when we're together â™ª

22:07.630 --> 22:12.287
â™ª Well, it's always
better when we're together â™ª

22:12.331 --> 22:16.291
â™ª Yeah, it's always better
when we're together... â™ª

22:16.335 --> 22:17.423
What?

22:25.779 --> 22:28.216
LIZZIE:
Songwriting? Stop.

22:28.259 --> 22:30.044
I can't take it anymore.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.219
Somewhere in Belgium,

22:31.262 --> 22:34.657
Penelope Park's
black heart just exploded.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.659
You and Gizmo the Gremlin?

22:36.703 --> 22:38.661
Actually, Gizmo's a Mogwai.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.141
Oh, God.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.838
He's got you speaking nerd.

22:41.882 --> 22:44.450
Relax. We're just friends.You are not friends.

22:44.493 --> 22:47.670
You're a montage.It's been...

22:47.714 --> 22:48.802
fun.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.804
It's been, like, actual fun.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.414
You know what's
actual-actual fun?

22:52.458 --> 22:53.633
Mom and I taking

22:53.676 --> 22:56.418
the speed train to Rome
for the weekend.

22:56.462 --> 22:59.160
So get your ass
across the pond.

22:59.203 --> 23:01.075
Love you.

23:06.994 --> 23:09.213
How long do you think
we've been here?

23:09.257 --> 23:10.606
Hard to say.

23:11.477 --> 23:14.741
A week? A month?

23:14.784 --> 23:16.699
A year? What difference
does it make?

23:16.743 --> 23:19.702
What the hell was that?

23:19.746 --> 23:21.835
Uh, a gargoyle, I think.

23:21.878 --> 23:24.185
I killed one once
with my friends.

23:24.228 --> 23:25.795
You know, my teenage friends.

23:25.839 --> 23:29.712
So why is a supervillain
like you scared?

23:30.931 --> 23:32.367
I'm not a villain.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.501
I never have been.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.720
I'm just a kid who's
afraid of his father

23:37.764 --> 23:41.898
and will do anything
to get away from him.

23:41.942 --> 23:45.249
My entire life's been
about figuring out how.

23:45.293 --> 23:49.036
And failing miserably.

23:53.214 --> 23:55.695
Papilio lux.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.311
You think
that's our ticket out?

24:03.354 --> 24:06.096
No. It's a comfort spell.

24:06.140 --> 24:09.448
It's, it's supposed
to provide peace of mind.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.584
Thank you.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.596
Why did you do that?Do what?

24:34.821 --> 24:36.649
BOTH:
Oh, crap.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.744
Invisique. Meaning?

24:44.787 --> 24:45.788
I'm invisible to them.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.224
You're invisible. What about me?

25:11.771 --> 25:13.686
Guess we're partners after all.

25:13.729 --> 25:16.340
I didn't say that.But you did just save my life.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.865
Because you're keeping things
from me, and I want to know why.

25:19.561 --> 25:20.997
Veritas tempus.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.651
Would you stop with the magic
already? It's not fair.

25:22.695 --> 25:23.957
Think before
you answer.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.222
Is it unfair,
or do you deserve it?

25:29.223 --> 25:31.051
I totally deserve it.

25:31.747 --> 25:32.966
What?

25:33.009 --> 25:34.620
Wh-Why-why did I just say that?

25:34.663 --> 25:37.753
Because I cast a truth spell.
You can only answer me honestly.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.538
Now, how does that
make you feel?

25:39.581 --> 25:42.541
Like this isn't gonna
end well for me.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.066
I bring him dinner every day
at 5:00. I mean, sometimes

25:46.109 --> 25:48.155
he doesn't come out of
the woods, but he's always here.

25:48.198 --> 25:50.026
Well, that doesn't mean
something happened.
Raf's a wolf.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.419
It's not like he wears a watch.But every day,

25:51.462 --> 25:54.030
Josie, for months,
and it's been three days, and...

25:54.074 --> 25:55.597
Maybe I am just
assuming the worst,

25:55.641 --> 25:57.381
but the worst is usually what
happens. And it's bad enough

25:57.425 --> 25:59.645
that he's stuck as a wolf,
but if-if he's lost,

25:59.688 --> 26:00.820
he's got no one.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.386
I can't let him be alone.Landon.

26:02.430 --> 26:03.953
It's gonna be okay.

26:03.997 --> 26:06.608
We're gonna find him.
I'll do a locator spell,

26:06.652 --> 26:08.654
and we're gonna track
his movements, okay?

26:09.742 --> 26:11.744
I'm gonna help you.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.315
HOPE:
This entire time,

26:18.359 --> 26:20.100
I've been working on a theory,
you know,

26:20.143 --> 26:23.407
trying to figure out
why the vortex comes.

26:23.451 --> 26:28.804
And then I realized,
it's always after I do magic.

26:28.848 --> 26:32.286
Am I getting warm?

26:32.329 --> 26:34.593
Scalding.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.378
You know, it makes a lot of
sense when you think about it.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.902
I thought that I was wrong
about me being the only one

26:39.946 --> 26:42.122
who could destroy him,
but I think my actual mistake

26:42.165 --> 26:45.386
was that I, I wasn't
a fully activated Tribrid

26:45.429 --> 26:47.170
when I dove into that pit.

26:47.214 --> 26:50.739
I've never died, so my vampire
side hasn't been activated yet.

26:50.783 --> 26:53.220
And what I'm realizing now
is that Malivore

26:53.263 --> 26:55.135
doesn't want me here.

26:56.789 --> 26:58.747
I'm toxic to him.

26:58.791 --> 27:01.402
Finish that sentence, please?

27:01.445 --> 27:03.056
Malivore's trying to expel you.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.275
To send you back
from where you came.

27:05.319 --> 27:07.756
And every time he tries...I grab hold of you

27:07.800 --> 27:11.238
to try to get expelled with you.

27:11.281 --> 27:14.154
But as much as my father
wants you to leave,

27:14.197 --> 27:17.940
he wants to keep
torturing me here even more.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.942
Then it's official.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.770
All we have to do is wait.

27:21.814 --> 27:24.512
For what?

27:27.341 --> 27:29.560
That's my ride.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.084
Hope, you can't leave me here.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.651
I can't leave with you. Okay?

27:32.694 --> 27:33.826
I have to get back
to my friends.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.697
I have to get back to Landon.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.133
I can't lie, right?

27:37.177 --> 27:39.658
So you know I'm telling
the truth when I say that if you

27:39.701 --> 27:40.876
help me go back, too,

27:40.920 --> 27:42.312
you'll never see me again.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.314
I promise.

27:44.358 --> 27:45.881
I'm sorry.

27:45.925 --> 27:49.363
But do you understand
why I can't take that risk?

27:49.406 --> 27:52.671
Yeah. I would do the same thing
if I were you.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.673
God.Good luck, Clarke.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.849
Screw you, Hope.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.861
Think of my blood like
the red line crossing the map

28:08.904 --> 28:10.340
in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

28:10.384 --> 28:12.516
It'll flow
wherever it senses Raf.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.736
And it'll show us the path.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.352
Thank you for this.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.833
Of course.
It's honestly child's play.

28:24.877 --> 28:27.401
It's how I used to cheat
at hide-and-go-seek.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.011
And just

28:29.055 --> 28:30.404
give it a second.

28:32.798 --> 28:36.715
I want you to know, I wasn't
trying to hurt myself.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.281
On the Fourth.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.936
I wasn't trying
to, like,

28:40.980 --> 28:43.722
self-destruct or anything.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.028
Mm, could've fooled me.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.248
I don't know. Maybe
it started like that,

28:48.291 --> 28:52.774
but when I go under,
I see... images.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.690
Memories, maybe.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.737
There's something buried
in my brain, and when I die,

28:58.780 --> 29:01.435
I get a glimpse of it, but...

29:04.481 --> 29:05.874
Maybe it's nothing.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.876
Maybe it's the answer
to everything. I don't know.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.444
No answer is more important
than making sure

29:10.487 --> 29:14.056
that you don't accidentally
overshoot your phoenix quota.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.195
Are you happy?

29:22.238 --> 29:23.979
What do you mean?I mean,

29:24.023 --> 29:25.502
since we started hanging out--

29:25.546 --> 29:29.419
I mean, until Raf went missing--
I think I was

29:29.463 --> 29:33.249
finally starting to get...

29:33.293 --> 29:35.425
happy-ish.

29:35.469 --> 29:38.037
I'm definitely happy-ish.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.735
I just don't know if I can be
fully happy until I know

29:40.779 --> 29:44.086
that Lizzie and I are gonna
survive past the Merge.

29:47.133 --> 29:48.351
Yeah.

29:48.395 --> 29:51.224
Look, I don't want
to cause problems,

29:51.267 --> 29:53.617
but I think that your dad
is lying to you

29:53.661 --> 29:55.445
about the Ascendant.

29:55.489 --> 29:58.361
How do you know?

29:58.405 --> 30:01.538
I just know.

30:04.628 --> 30:09.068
â™ª Take me to wild

30:09.111 --> 30:12.549
â™ª Take me to the water...

30:12.593 --> 30:14.769
Forensic detective?

30:16.510 --> 30:17.685
Close.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.818
True crime novelist.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.950
You're a liar.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.170
Josie.You can't be in here.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.694
She can't be in here.Yeah, I'm aware.

30:26.737 --> 30:28.174
Just give me a second.

30:28.217 --> 30:29.653
What's going on?All summer

30:29.697 --> 30:31.220
I've been worried about you.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.874
"Got to take care of Dad,
make sure that he doesn't fall

30:32.918 --> 30:34.484
into a depression
or buy a motorcycle."

30:34.528 --> 30:37.052
I gave up my summer
with Mom to make sure

30:37.096 --> 30:38.575
that you wouldn't be alone,
and this entire time

30:38.619 --> 30:40.621
you've been lying to me
about the Ascendant?

30:40.664 --> 30:42.362
I...I'm calling the cops.

30:42.405 --> 30:45.408
Let the man talk
to his daughter.

30:45.452 --> 30:46.757
â™ª Take me to the light...

30:46.801 --> 30:48.672
Dad, how could you?

30:48.716 --> 30:51.153
Dad told me everything.

30:51.197 --> 30:52.894
The Ascendant
is a lock

30:52.938 --> 30:54.504
to a prison world.

30:54.548 --> 30:57.116
It's a long story,
but we have an uncle

30:57.159 --> 30:59.031
that is trapped down there,
and he is the only other

30:59.074 --> 31:00.641
living member of
our lunatic family.

31:00.684 --> 31:03.862
And he's been through the Merge,
so he's got to have answers.

31:03.905 --> 31:06.212
Well, then let's go
the minute I get back.

31:06.255 --> 31:07.256
Lizzie,

31:07.300 --> 31:09.868
I gave the Ascendant
back to Dad.

31:09.911 --> 31:12.392
You what? Why?

31:12.435 --> 31:14.437
This guy that's trapped
down there killed Jo

31:14.481 --> 31:15.917
on her wedding day

31:15.961 --> 31:17.832
with Dad.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.921
I mean, this guy
murdered his twin.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.576
So, Dad said it's
a last resort.

31:22.619 --> 31:27.450
And until then we should
just stay far away from it.

31:27.494 --> 31:29.626
So, in the meantime

31:29.670 --> 31:31.802
you should enjoy

31:31.846 --> 31:35.154
your speed trains
and hang out

31:35.197 --> 31:38.374
with hot Swedish guys
and have your summer fun.

31:40.246 --> 31:41.900
Listen.

31:41.943 --> 31:44.641
I'm in therapy
three hours a day.

31:44.685 --> 31:47.035
When I'm not with a shrink,
I'm with a doctor.

31:47.079 --> 31:50.386
And when I'm not with a doctor,
I'm with a healer.

31:50.430 --> 31:54.042
I'm doing everything I can
to get better,

31:54.086 --> 31:58.264
like, really better.

31:58.307 --> 32:02.268
I should have told you that.
I don't know why I didn't.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.186
But promise me

32:07.229 --> 32:10.058
you will
make the most

32:10.102 --> 32:13.105
of the rest
of this summer, okay?

32:14.367 --> 32:16.717
I promise.

32:27.293 --> 32:30.600
I didn't see you. Are you okay?

32:30.644 --> 32:32.037
Yeah, Dorian, I'm okay.

32:32.080 --> 32:36.563
Glad to hear it,
but how did you know my name?

32:38.608 --> 32:40.959
Your parking pass.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.530
Always hated that picture.

32:49.141 --> 32:51.360
What brings you
out here tonight?

32:54.059 --> 32:55.974
A boy.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.456
Well, we're all locked up
in there.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.328
Everyone's gone for the summer.

33:02.371 --> 33:06.985
Okay. Thanks.
Uh, sorry to bother you.

33:36.188 --> 33:39.539
You started
without me.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.758
Your map worked.

33:43.586 --> 33:45.849
He's right here.
What's the problem?
He was,

33:45.893 --> 33:50.724
but then when I came out here
to find him, that appeared.

33:51.899 --> 33:54.684
Raf's not missing.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.861
He just doesn't want

33:57.905 --> 34:00.038
to be here anymore.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.781
I knew this going in.

34:04.825 --> 34:07.915
I mean, uh, the longer he's a
wolf, the less human he'll be,

34:07.958 --> 34:11.049
and at what point does a wolf no
longer need a human best friend

34:11.092 --> 34:14.226
and movie nights?

34:17.142 --> 34:20.884
â™ª But I've got a lot to say...

34:20.928 --> 34:24.236
Maybe he moved on.

34:25.193 --> 34:27.152
'Cause he saw that
you have someone

34:27.195 --> 34:29.197
who can help you be

34:29.241 --> 34:32.505
happy... ish.

34:32.548 --> 34:37.379
â™ª Well, it feels
many moons away â™ª

34:40.426 --> 34:43.603
â™ª But I came for you

34:43.646 --> 34:47.824
â™ª I've dreamt names for you

34:47.868 --> 34:50.392
â™ª It's true

34:50.436 --> 34:54.614
â™ª No one makes me
high like you do. â™ª

35:27.429 --> 35:29.431
Hey.

35:30.432 --> 35:32.652
Is this seat taken?

35:35.481 --> 35:37.091
Landon.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.180
â™ª Lying...

35:39.224 --> 35:41.182
Wait, how do you
know my name?

35:41.226 --> 35:43.141
Sorry.

35:44.577 --> 35:48.755
There's no way I'd even pretend
to forget Hope Mikaelson.

35:50.670 --> 35:53.716
You're just saying that because
you know I want to hear it.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.501
Well, actually,
that's not how this works.

35:55.544 --> 35:57.416
I'm kind of here
to tell you the things

35:57.459 --> 35:58.808
you don't want to hear, right?

35:58.852 --> 36:01.333
Yeah.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.509
â™ª At the end of every road

36:03.552 --> 36:05.641
â™ª You were good to me...

36:08.775 --> 36:11.125
I really needed to see you.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.735
Happy to be seen.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.781
Well, I mean,
as happy as the magical,

36:14.824 --> 36:18.350
holographic manifestation
of your subconscious can be.

36:18.393 --> 36:20.526
So what's on your mind?

36:25.095 --> 36:26.662
I missed your eyes.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.229
Oh, admittedly,
they're pretty dreamy.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.796
So much
for accuracy.

36:29.839 --> 36:32.755
Landon would never say that.Well, it's creative license.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.409
Besides, let's face it,
you already know

36:34.453 --> 36:36.542
what he'd say
about your current dilemma.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.763
Then maybe I just want to
hear it from fake you.
Fine.

36:40.807 --> 36:42.504
Then, in that case,
there is no world

36:42.548 --> 36:44.027
in which I would ever
want you to leave town

36:44.071 --> 36:46.465
without telling me
you're back from the dead.

36:46.508 --> 36:47.596
I never died, technically.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.512
Then I'd want to hear
about that, too.

36:50.556 --> 36:53.211
I'd want to hear
about everything

36:53.254 --> 36:55.256
because I love you,

36:55.300 --> 36:58.259
and you love me.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.434
You leaving town

36:59.478 --> 37:01.044
is a stupid move
and you know it.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.264
Especially after we agreed
not to lie to each other.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.005
Don't turn this
around on me.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.399
Okay, besides, what's happening
between you and Josie?

37:07.442 --> 37:10.228
â™ª And I'm so used
to letting go... â™ª

37:10.271 --> 37:12.012
Ugh.

37:12.055 --> 37:15.276
So you're mad at me?
No.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.279
I'm not mad at you.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.803
I can't be mad at you, right?

37:20.847 --> 37:22.588
It's not your fault.

37:22.631 --> 37:25.112
You don't even
know I exist.

37:25.155 --> 37:26.983
But that still hurts.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.856
Of course it does.

37:29.899 --> 37:31.466
Okay.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.556
So, then think about how much
it would hurt me to find out

37:34.600 --> 37:36.254
you're just down the road.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.473
Fair enough.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.562
â™ª Hearts I've broke

37:40.606 --> 37:45.045
â™ª Now my tears flow

37:46.438 --> 37:48.483
If you can answer
this one question correctly,

37:48.527 --> 37:50.746
then I promise
I'll go running back to you,

37:50.790 --> 37:53.793
and I'll, I'll tell you
the whole truth.

37:53.836 --> 37:55.838
Would you quit
playing games?

37:55.882 --> 37:57.753
There is no answer
either of us could give

37:57.797 --> 37:59.494
that should stop you
from doing that right now.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.496
Are you happy?

38:03.846 --> 38:07.023
â™ª And now I'm closing
every door â™ª

38:07.067 --> 38:09.678
Is everyone happier now?

38:09.722 --> 38:13.291
â™ª 'Cause I'm sick
of wanting more â™ª

38:13.334 --> 38:16.294
â™ª You were good to me

38:18.121 --> 38:20.080
â™ª You were good to me...

38:20.123 --> 38:21.951
Could you leave me for a minute?

38:21.995 --> 38:24.258
I don't really want to cry
in front of you,

38:24.302 --> 38:26.260
even if you're fake.

38:26.304 --> 38:31.221
â™ª I won't hurt you anymore

38:31.265 --> 38:34.921
â™ª 'Cause you were good to me.

38:45.018 --> 38:49.979
So you, uh, feel like
I let you down, huh?

38:50.023 --> 38:51.677
Nah. Nah.

38:51.720 --> 38:54.114
Uh, best summer ever's
a big ask.

38:54.157 --> 38:55.898
Man, why do you always do that?

38:55.942 --> 38:58.858
What?Not speak your truth.

39:00.686 --> 39:03.906
Okay, this summer sucked.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.908
I mean, you tell
me to move on,

39:05.952 --> 39:07.910
and the first time
I actually do,

39:07.954 --> 39:09.695
you tell me I can't
even talk to her.

39:09.738 --> 39:11.610
She's my sister, man.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.655
Just like you're my brother.

39:13.699 --> 39:17.659
I'm sorry, but I want my
family tree to have branches.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.968
But I'll make it up to you
if you give me a shot.

39:22.011 --> 39:23.491
How?

39:23.535 --> 39:26.755
By getting you what you want
most in the entire world.

39:28.191 --> 39:31.847
Lizzie Saltzman.

39:31.891 --> 39:35.373
You-you said we-we weren't
supposed to speak her name.Uh-huh,

39:35.416 --> 39:36.852
during the summer,

39:36.896 --> 39:39.333
but that's all over with,
baby boy.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.987
Now we set our sights on

39:41.030 --> 39:44.033
best semester ever.

39:45.339 --> 39:46.732
Okay?

39:47.559 --> 39:49.735
Let's finish packing.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.695
And you should
definitely make room for this.

40:27.555 --> 40:28.817
Oh, crap.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.864
I can't believe
this is happening again.

40:31.907 --> 40:35.258
What do you want
from me, Father?

40:35.302 --> 40:39.349
Because I literally
cannot suffer anymore.

40:39.393 --> 40:42.570
And... make no mistake,

40:42.614 --> 40:46.748
you did make me, so...

40:46.792 --> 40:51.666
please give me one final chance
to serve you.

40:55.148 --> 40:56.845
Send me back.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.766
Send me back

41:04.810 --> 41:08.640
and I will be
what you always wanted.

41:09.989 --> 41:12.513
I'll be the bad guy.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.515
I'll make you proud.

41:16.996 --> 41:18.563
You need me.

41:18.606 --> 41:22.436
Because if you do not trust me
to raise you from perdition,

41:22.480 --> 41:26.309
trust that I will do this.

41:26.353 --> 41:30.705
I will destroy Hope Mikaelson,

41:30.749 --> 41:34.666
the only thing on this planet
that can destroy you.

41:35.884 --> 41:38.539
You send me back, and I...

41:40.410 --> 41:42.500
Father?

41:42.543 --> 41:44.676
Is that you?
