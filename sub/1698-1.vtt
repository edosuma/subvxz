00:13.881 --> 00:15.418
I've never been so happy!

00:21.885 --> 00:24.716
- Well then prepare to be ecstatic!
- Eeep!

00:28.132 --> 00:31.875
Aarrrgh!

00:34.895 --> 00:37.678
I have got to stop sneaking
daddy's pork rinds before bed.

00:46.116 --> 00:48.220
Oh...

00:59.576 --> 01:01.480
- Miley!!
- Aarrgh!

01:03.184 --> 01:04.319
Oh great, you're up!

01:04.330 --> 01:09.726
You know, if you didn't have that whole
Miley-Hannah thing over me, bang zoom!

01:10.083 --> 01:11.980
Yeah yeah! I'm shaking in my boots

01:12.051 --> 01:16.008
Speaking of which, I can't wait to wear these
tomorrow on the Mack and Micky in the morning show

01:16.021 --> 01:17.528
Cause this is
gonna be so awesome!

01:17.628 --> 01:20.983
Hannah Montana and her peeps to
keep her grounded, eep I'm a peep!

01:21.485 --> 01:23.757
Did you put extra sugar on
your sugar crunchies again?

01:23.902 --> 01:27.736
Just a little bit, I'm so excited,
I barely slept last night

01:28.151 --> 01:29.277
That makes 2 of us

01:29.549 --> 01:33.798
I had a dream that you would not
believe, you were about to kiss...

01:34.647 --> 01:36.001
I can't even say it...

01:36.090 --> 01:37.316
Who was I about to kiss?

01:41.829 --> 01:43.635
Jackson, blaaa!!!

01:44.899 --> 01:46.802
Why aren't you blaaaing with me?

01:47.630 --> 01:51.186
- Well...
- Well... is not a option

01:51.348 --> 01:53.641
You either blaa or errr, pick one!

01:54.998 --> 01:57.603
But... I kinda like him

01:58.245 --> 02:00.537
Jackson lovin' freak of nature say what?

02:02.454 --> 02:06.034
S03E01:
He Ain't A Hottie, He's My Brother

02:06.644 --> 02:09.114
Initial Edit By:
VeRdiKT [Subscene.com]

02:57.060 --> 02:59.068
Jackson is kina cute

02:59.072 --> 03:04.002
Lilly, that is crazy! You always
found him completely repulsive!

03:04.624 --> 03:06.736
That's one of the things
i loved most about you

03:06.782 --> 03:08.271
I was only doing that because of you!

03:08.336 --> 03:11.381
Inside I was always
thinking... something else!

03:12.010 --> 03:14.342
Hey, you wanna hear my inner thoughts?

03:14.643 --> 03:17.426
Lilly, boing!

03:17.918 --> 03:22.270
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't tell you because I knew I'd get a... boing!

03:23.201 --> 03:25.934
Don't you boing and walk away from me?

03:26.269 --> 03:27.316
Get back here!

03:30.153 --> 03:32.808
Wow! You do not
wanna go in there.

03:35.836 --> 03:37.380
Oh come on!

03:47.466 --> 03:48.295
Stop that!

03:50.139 --> 03:53.052
Oliver, tell her
how ridiculous this is

03:53.972 --> 03:58.435
Miley, can you tell the sun
not to rise in the morning?

03:58.916 --> 04:02.418
I mean, can you tell a wave
not to crash on the shore?

04:03.340 --> 04:05.057
You been watching soap operas again?

04:05.171 --> 04:09.087
No, no it's... my grandma came
in town, she's visiting and...

04:09.819 --> 04:10.956
She um...

04:11.501 --> 04:14.204
Ok! Storm and Erica just came
out of their duel coma and I

04:14.205 --> 04:16.908
had to find out if they remember
their passion for each other.

04:18.107 --> 04:19.925
And they did!

04:20.920 --> 04:21.697
Yea!

04:22.139 --> 04:24.112
Hey, um Oliver what
are you doing tomorrow?

04:24.153 --> 04:27.066
Are you kidding? I'm one of your peeps on
the Mack and Mickey in the morning show

04:27.343 --> 04:28.756
Damn it, I did invite you

04:30.071 --> 04:32.551
Oh are you lost little guy? Huh?

04:33.935 --> 04:37.069
Let's go find your mommy, yes we will

04:37.470 --> 04:39.331
- Hey everybody
- Hi

04:42.962 --> 04:47.588
Lilly, please, Lord Voldermort would look
cute with the puppy, snap out of it!

04:48.410 --> 04:51.993
You know this is all your fault anyway,
you're the one who had that stupid dream!

04:52.052 --> 04:54.246
I was perfectly happy
crushing in silence and

04:54.247 --> 04:56.441
stealing hair off the brush
when no one was looking

04:57.303 --> 04:58.028
What?

04:59.547 --> 05:02.269
And by what, I mean ew!

05:02.958 --> 05:05.999
Ok look, Lilly, what I think
Miley is trying to say is that:

05:06.324 --> 05:08.766
You know everybody crushes on
someone who doesn't like them back

05:10.003 --> 05:13.036
You just gotta suck it up,
and you gotta move on

05:14.754 --> 05:19.377
Look I'm sorry, but getting rejected by the
entire girl softball team it stings a little bit!

05:20.179 --> 05:23.636
Come on Oliver you didn't get
rejected by the entire softball team!

05:24.613 --> 05:27.293
- Lilly, they hired a skywriter.
- Ooh!

05:30.005 --> 05:32.739
Well... we don't know that
Jackson doesn't like me back

05:32.989 --> 05:36.623
And... if you did know, he
didn't like you back, could

05:36.624 --> 05:40.258
you move on that someone,
oh, I don't know... human?

05:41.362 --> 05:42.789
Well I guess I have to...

05:42.799 --> 05:45.953
- Alright, let's go talk to him
- What?

05:45.964 --> 05:47.915
No no no no no!
That's a terrible idea!

05:48.002 --> 05:51.823
You know there are certain things
in life a girl just have to do alone

05:52.279 --> 05:54.282
You go talk to him and
tell me what he says

05:55.059 --> 05:56.990
Ok fine but don't get your hopes up

05:57.065 --> 06:01.286
For he to like you back he would have
to have taste depth and intelligence

06:02.004 --> 06:04.670
We're talking about a guy who
once ate the farmer's jam jar.

06:22.708 --> 06:23.651
Robby Stewart?

06:23.653 --> 06:26.297
That would be me. Hey first,
tell me what you think of this. и

06:26.424 --> 06:28.017
I'm super cute super hot

06:28.085 --> 06:29.640
I'm the girl you like a lot

06:29.648 --> 06:31.083
I'm super, super girl

06:31.171 --> 06:32.671
I'm super, super girl

06:33.172 --> 06:34.177
What do you think?

06:34.503 --> 06:36.572
I think you're super super weird.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.605
The gardener loved it!

06:44.378 --> 06:47.521
Hey Mile, I got your information for
the Mack and Mickey show tomorrow.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.330
Limo's picking you up by seven.

06:49.473 --> 06:52.945
Have you seen Jackson? I need to find him
and tell him that Lilly's crushing on him.

06:53.025 --> 06:55.781
She is? Well I just
think that's adorable!

06:56.661 --> 06:59.953
Am I the only one that
remembers the jam jar?

07:00.513 --> 07:03.965
Come on Mile, what's so weird
about Lilly liking your brother?

07:04.310 --> 07:06.187
Does puppy pee stain?

07:07.595 --> 07:09.414
Asked, and answered

07:10.339 --> 07:15.000
I swear, with me as an example, i
just don't see how he turned out so

07:15.047 --> 07:18.432
I'm super cute super hot
I'm the girl you like a lot

07:18.469 --> 07:21.491
I'm super, super girl
I'm super, super girl

07:21.556 --> 07:23.435
Yeah! It's catchy!

07:25.291 --> 07:28.032
- Hey Jackson бн
- Hold on, just a sec.

07:29.285 --> 07:33.155
Dang flab it! This is why i
don't change my shirt everyday!

07:34.517 --> 07:36.172
What does that girl see in you?

07:36.678 --> 07:40.118
What girl? There's a girl? Is
she cute? Average, below average?

07:40.144 --> 07:42.367
I'm not desperate, it's just
I- you know, it's been a while.

07:45.375 --> 07:48.150
It's I- you're not
going to believe this бн

07:48.428 --> 07:49.616
It's Lilly!

07:50.582 --> 07:51.917
She's crushing on you.

07:52.187 --> 07:54.531
- Lilly?
- I know! I don't get it either!

07:55.389 --> 07:56.818
She's like a sister.

07:56.995 --> 08:01.146
Y'know, sort of like you, except without
the enormous ego and hint of a girl stach.

08:02.917 --> 08:07.388
It's peach fuzz, it's cute, and it's
not what we're talking about here.

08:08.951 --> 08:11.711
Ok, so can you just tell me
that you don't think about

08:11.712 --> 08:14.471
her that way, and Lilly and
I can go back to being normal,

08:14.780 --> 08:19.271
And you can go back to doing what you do best.
Being a disgrace to the Stewart family name.

08:19.315 --> 08:21.529
Fine. I don't think
about Lilly that way.

08:21.775 --> 08:23.371
Great! I'll go tell her.

08:23.381 --> 08:24.127
Huh?

08:24.891 --> 08:26.259
I-huh what?

08:26.584 --> 08:28.627
I'm starting to think
about Lilly that way.

08:28.703 --> 08:32.943
No! No, no, no! Wrong way,
go back! Beep, beep, beep!

08:33.008 --> 08:36.529
Wait. She's cute, she's smart
she's not a kid anymore...

08:37.783 --> 08:39.142
Jackson likey.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.616
And Miley pukey.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.482
Now if you'll excuse me, I
gotta' groom for my new lady.

08:46.006 --> 08:47.157
Aargh!

08:48.098 --> 08:49.958
Who gave that dog asparagus?

08:54.135 --> 08:57.361
Omm, it doesn't matter if he likes me.

08:58.130 --> 09:01.331
Omm, whatever happens if for the best.

09:02.565 --> 09:06.349
Omm, I could always get a cat

09:06.810 --> 09:11.162
- Lilly?
- Omm, cute little kitty from the pound.

09:12.056 --> 09:13.841
- Lilly!
- Aargh!

09:17.007 --> 09:20.562
Omm, now we're even for the bed thing.

09:21.441 --> 09:22.972
What did he say? Tell me everything!

09:23.163 --> 09:25.009
- Ok, he
- No, just tell me if he likes me.

09:25.072 --> 09:26.999
- Ok, he
- No, start at the beginning бн

09:27.480 --> 09:29.718
- Ok, he
- No, forget this, just skip to the end!

09:30.014 --> 09:32.010
- Will you make up your mind?
- I can't, you pick.

09:33.513 --> 09:34.644
Ok

09:35.268 --> 09:38.346
I can't believe I'm actually
going to say this but, he um бн

09:38.439 --> 09:40.951
Oh my gosh, he does like me!

09:41.258 --> 09:44.402
This is going to change
everything! Can't you just see it?

09:45.416 --> 09:46.080
No!

09:46.367 --> 09:47.821
No, see it's right up there, see?

09:51.955 --> 09:55.179
- This is so good!
- So good!

09:56.030 --> 09:59.436
- You are so cute!
- You are so cute!

10:05.418 --> 10:07.549
I love you!

10:08.894 --> 10:10.292
Oh, thank-you.

10:19.520 --> 10:23.348
What'd he say? I want his exact
words so I can put them in my diary.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.058
Ok, he's exact words were бн

10:28.165 --> 10:29.569
Never gonna' happen.

10:32.203 --> 10:33.176
Really?

10:34.108 --> 10:35.651
I'm sorry Lilly.

10:36.831 --> 10:37.800
It's ok.

10:38.719 --> 10:42.843
It's not like it's your fault!

10:55.143 --> 10:56.768
Lilly

10:59.039 --> 11:04.027
Listen, we don't need guys to have fun. We're
gonna' have fun on the Mack and Mickey show, right?

11:04.569 --> 11:07.681
Yeah, you're right. We
are going to have fun.

11:08.323 --> 11:10.228
You, me, Oliver

11:10.559 --> 11:13.679
And Jackson!

11:14.005 --> 11:17.039
Ok, listen, I know it hurts now,
but it really is for the best!

11:17.279 --> 11:17.939
Hey Lilly.

11:24.235 --> 11:25.893
What is up with her?

11:26.469 --> 11:29.821
I had to tell her, that, um бн
Jackson doesn't like her back.

11:30.592 --> 11:32.028
Oh man, that's rough.

11:33.541 --> 11:37.031
You know Erica had the same reaction
when Storm left her for evil twin cousin.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.279
Grandma never saw it coming.

11:40.121 --> 11:41.884
But I knew!

11:42.821 --> 11:47.666
Hey Miles, where's Lilly? The lucky
winner of the Jackson love lotto.

11:48.454 --> 11:51.324
What? But you just said that ow!

11:52.095 --> 11:54.302
Split end, ladies hate that.

11:55.393 --> 11:58.144
Um... turns out I was
wrong, she doesn't like you.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.140
She doesn't?

11:59.511 --> 12:01.775
You just told her that ow!

12:02.075 --> 12:05.378
- Why do you keep doing that?
- That... That was the other end!

12:06.052 --> 12:08.398
Because it was split, you see?

12:11.537 --> 12:13.617
It actually turns out that

12:14.031 --> 12:19.932
When she said she likes Jackson, she
meant she likes president Andrew Jackson.

12:20.051 --> 12:21.419
I mean come on, who doesn't?

12:23.364 --> 12:24.967
So she doesn't like me?

12:25.305 --> 12:26.209
No.

12:26.918 --> 12:29.282
When she heard
that I thought she meant

12:29.283 --> 12:31.646
- you, she laughed so hard бн
- She laughed?

12:33.619 --> 12:36.101
Not really a laugh, it was
more like a little giggle,

12:36.264 --> 12:38.183
Little titter, you know
like 'he he he', but less.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.184
I get it.

12:40.643 --> 12:43.268
Come on Jackson, it's not
like you cared anywayz.

12:43.278 --> 12:44.768
You're right, I didn't.

12:45.051 --> 12:49.393
I mean, I was just trying to be nice,
because that's totally the kinda guy I am.

12:50.046 --> 12:53.873
It's gonna take a lot more than a rejection
from a soft girl to get this guy down. б

12:57.277 --> 13:00.659
You deserve love,
you're an awesome dude.

13:01.544 --> 13:03.274
You deserve love!

13:05.378 --> 13:08.029
What did you do?

13:15.341 --> 13:16.229
Hey Jackson!

13:16.356 --> 13:19.539
I deserve love, I am an awesome dude!

13:20.962 --> 13:22.217
Okey dokey бн

13:23.962 --> 13:24.497
Hey Mile!

13:24.713 --> 13:27.250
I did the right thing, ok!

13:29.515 --> 13:33.157
Now a good daddy would go up there
and try and figure out what's going on.

13:33.749 --> 13:36.887
But a smart daddy would
give them a chance to work

13:36.888 --> 13:40.026
it out for themselves while
he ate a piece of pizza.

13:41.304 --> 13:43.352
Robby Stewart smart daddy.

13:46.445 --> 13:48.732
Hot, hot, hot!

13:50.017 --> 13:52.036
Let's get crazy!

13:52.427 --> 13:55.739
Get up and dance, take
a swing, do your thing

13:55.782 --> 13:57.479
Itбфs worth taking a chance

13:57.516 --> 13:59.650
Let's get crazy!

14:02.171 --> 14:05.125
Wow! Isn't she wonderful!

14:05.240 --> 14:08.262
Give it up for Hannah Savanna!

14:08.460 --> 14:11.312
Oh, are you from Savanna,
is that how you got the name?

14:11.315 --> 14:13.801
Oh, Mack, don't be silly,
it's Montana!

14:13.811 --> 14:14.970
Yeah, and I'm from Tennessee.

14:15.053 --> 14:19.280
Oh, sorry, I was never
good at geometry anyway.

14:19.352 --> 14:21.274
It's a good thing
I'm easy on the eyes!

14:23.352 --> 14:28.923
So Hannah. We've heard so many things
about pop stars who lost their way.

14:29.015 --> 14:34.395
- It's really sad, but I've been really fortunate to бн
- You know who else lost their way our producer Richie

14:35.621 --> 14:38.171
- Driving in this morning!
- He did! He did!

14:38.177 --> 14:40.606
Hey Richie, two words for you, GPS!

14:41.693 --> 14:45.082
They talk to you now, like a
wife, but you can unplug it!

14:46.561 --> 14:48.677
And uh, you can't unplug a wife!

14:48.684 --> 14:51.731
You can't unplug a wife! She
said you can't unplug a wife!

14:52.008 --> 14:54.240
Very funny, that's funny

14:54.680 --> 14:58.372
So I think what Hannah was
trying to say is that she

14:58.373 --> 15:02.064
surrounds herself with good
friends who help keep her grounded.

15:02.065 --> 15:05.587
I used to have good friends.
But I was just too good looking.

15:07.227 --> 15:08.854
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful!

15:11.119 --> 15:14.394
So Hannah, why don't we bring out some
of these wonderful friends of yours?

15:14.607 --> 15:17.638
I think you're gonna' love them just
as much as I do. Come on out, guys!

15:17.672 --> 15:19.152
- Bring em' out!
- Oh yes!

15:19.187 --> 15:22.045
Welcome, welcome welcome

15:22.318 --> 15:26.930
Thank-you guys! This is um... Mike Stanley,
Lola Lovelagle, and Jackson Stewart.

15:27.102 --> 15:27.961
Oh.

15:31.518 --> 15:37.001
Oh, I sense a little bit of
tension in the pop star's posse.

15:37.877 --> 15:40.197
Tension? What tension?
There's no tension

15:40.767 --> 15:43.176
No, that's just a little
thing we do. We like hey Lola

15:43.888 --> 15:44.594
Hey Jackson

15:45.946 --> 15:48.107
That's right. It's... that's how we roll.

15:48.569 --> 15:49.560
Yo H-Dog!

15:51.887 --> 15:53.863
Thank-you Mike.
Thank-you for the help.

15:54.307 --> 15:55.225
Word.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.929
Oh, from your mother.

15:57.769 --> 15:59.042
It's actually to your mother.

15:59.371 --> 16:02.571
It's to your mother it's to
your mother, I never know.

16:03.389 --> 16:04.482
Never know.

16:05.236 --> 16:10.995
So Hannah, tell me, how did these wonderful
friends of yours help keep you grounded?

16:11.116 --> 16:13.722
Well I think the secret is
that we all liked each other

16:13.723 --> 16:16.328
before I was famous and
we all like each other now.

16:16.360 --> 16:16.789
Ah.

16:16.790 --> 16:21.490
Yeah well, we all like
Hannah, and I like Mike too.

16:22.535 --> 16:26.062
Yeah, Mike and Hannah are great.

16:26.212 --> 16:28.697
There's nothing about
them that's laughable.

16:30.887 --> 16:33.849
Wait? Laughable? What
are you talking about?

16:33.952 --> 16:36.286
- You know what you said
- What I said? You told me...

16:36.318 --> 16:37.951
And we'll be right back.

16:40.359 --> 16:41.412
I guess we're out.

16:41.975 --> 16:43.832
Oh, sticky buns time.

16:45.064 --> 16:45.749
What?

16:46.151 --> 16:50.241
Ok Hannah, honey. You're
doing great! My kids love you.

16:50.324 --> 16:53.374
If you ever call commercial
again, I'll... Punch you. Ok?

16:59.036 --> 17:03.785
Could you guys please not embarrass
me in front of millions of people.

17:03.954 --> 17:05.736
- But he/she started it!
- Zip it!

17:06.003 --> 17:13.480
Now please, just for the next fifteen minutes, focus on
Hannah and her friends, and how much we all love each other.

17:13.825 --> 17:16.200
Sorry. I know this is
none of your fault, so

17:16.300 --> 17:19.343
Ill try to be nice,
because I love you, not him.

17:21.355 --> 17:23.972
For my sister, because
none of this is her fault.

17:24.617 --> 17:25.954
Right бн

17:30.458 --> 17:32.999
Just remember Hannah, boop!

17:34.785 --> 17:38.055
And we're back in 5 4

17:42.693 --> 17:47.862
So, it sounds like you've all
known Hannah for a really long time.

17:48.176 --> 17:52.402
Jackson, tell me, what is
about Hannah you loved the most?

17:52.509 --> 17:57.810
Well, ar, like all friends, Hannah
and I have definitely had fights.

17:57.881 --> 18:00.971
But when it comes down to it, i
know I can always count on her.

18:03.064 --> 18:05.943
Because she's always,
always there for me.

18:07.729 --> 18:11.385
Always is such, such a big word.

18:11.433 --> 18:13.614
It is a big word. Al-ways.

18:14.531 --> 18:17.452
Yeah, and um, you know,
if you could count on me,

18:17.453 --> 18:20.373
almost of the time', you
could live with that. Right?

18:20.643 --> 18:23.604
Oh but we don't have to live with
it because she never lets us down.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.600
Never. Never. Never.

18:27.118 --> 18:30.943
Well, see, never is kind
of like always. Big word.

18:32.604 --> 18:39.662
And... you know what word I like better?
Is occasionally, and sometimes.

18:39.712 --> 18:43.142
Oh but there is no sometimes with
you because you always tell the truth.

18:43.727 --> 18:45.961
Yeah, to me too. Even if it's painful.

18:46.154 --> 18:48.572
Yeah, because that's just
the kind of person she is.

18:50.677 --> 18:52.084
Stop it!

18:53.192 --> 18:54.163
Really, stop

18:56.136 --> 18:58.526
You see, that's the
secret of real friendship.

18:59.507 --> 19:00.593
Integrity,

19:01.533 --> 19:02.603
Honesty,

19:04.225 --> 19:05.626
Truth бн

19:08.175 --> 19:09.819
Ok fine, I lied!

19:10.663 --> 19:12.286
The truth is бн

19:13.471 --> 19:15.366
You guys both really like each other.

19:15.536 --> 19:16.396
What?!

19:17.048 --> 19:18.217
What?

19:18.731 --> 19:19.543
What?!

19:20.786 --> 19:22.085
Who wants to hear another song?

19:22.416 --> 19:24.012
- I do!
- Me to!

19:24.664 --> 19:28.108
We're true friends

19:28.460 --> 19:31.503
We'll here till the end

19:31.820 --> 19:32.315
Oh no

19:33.044 --> 19:35.817
You pull me aside, nobody perfect!

19:36.175 --> 19:38.677
And live and you help me! !

19:43.331 --> 19:46.457
Guys, come on! How many times
do I have to say that I'm sorry?

19:47.842 --> 19:49.727
I just still can't believe
you'd lie to me like that.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.986
We got the party with us, ah ah ah ah! б

19:54.424 --> 19:56.874
Sweet niblets, what
are you guys doing home?

19:57.206 --> 19:58.248
New look, dad?

19:58.835 --> 20:03.379
Couldn't fit me in this week!
Hair like this doesnt just happen, son.

20:03.488 --> 20:06.911
Now, if youll excuse me, im gonna'
go upstairs and watch some football,

20:06.912 --> 20:10.334
monster trucks, and things that
explode like boom! You know, man things!

20:13.007 --> 20:16.811
Lilly, come on how many
times do I have to apologize?

20:16.972 --> 20:21.377
Ok, it's a little late for apologies,
you cold hearted killer of love!

20:22.032 --> 20:24.248
Yeah, I've never been
so disappointed in you.

20:24.672 --> 20:26.609
And you're so cute when
you flatter your nostrils!

20:26.672 --> 20:27.953
Oh, you like that, do you?

20:28.263 --> 20:29.245
Wow!

20:29.579 --> 20:31.243
Oh, uh, you got a little boogie.

20:31.544 --> 20:32.565
I'll pick it when you're not looking.

20:32.577 --> 20:34.339
- Oh, you're such a gentlemen.
- And you are so pretty.

20:34.383 --> 20:35.089
You're so cute!

20:35.227 --> 20:36.662
Do you hear yourself?

20:37.285 --> 20:39.148
This is why I did what I did.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.714
He'll ruin you,
I couldn't let that happen.

20:42.176 --> 20:46.492
You couldn't let that happen? This isn't
about you! This is about how I feel!

20:47.397 --> 20:53.930
And yeah, sure, sometimes Jackson's
gross, lazy, and maybe a little stinky бн

20:54.371 --> 20:55.698
You so get me!

20:56.170 --> 20:58.353
But who I date is my choice.

20:58.498 --> 21:02.311
And if im gonna' date Jackson,
and youre really my friend, then

21:02.555 --> 21:04.291
Youre just gonna' have to deal with it.

21:05.030 --> 21:09.070
Youre right. And if you
want to go ahead and date б

21:14.320 --> 21:17.704
Jackson, its just something
that I have to live with.

21:18.273 --> 21:19.017
It'll be ok.

21:24.012 --> 21:25.929
- My girls!
- Oh

21:27.212 --> 21:28.583
Oh, come on!

21:33.063 --> 21:35.400
Well, im glad that you've
finally accepted our love.

21:35.443 --> 21:36.843
As long as I dont have to see it.

21:37.456 --> 21:39.525
Well then you better close your eyes.

21:39.693 --> 21:42.355
Now come here, baby. Time to
seal this deal with a kiss.

21:43.438 --> 21:44.384
Aargh!

21:49.235 --> 21:50.190
Miley!

21:51.759 --> 21:56.155

me pick my outfit for Mack and Mickey tomorrow.

21:56.642 --> 21:58.652
- Thats tomorrow?
- Yes

22:00.145 --> 22:02.667
- I had the weirdest dream.
- What was it about?

22:04.260 --> 22:08.453
You liked Jackson
and he liked you back.

22:08.658 --> 22:12.312
And I tried to stop it,
but I was wrong, so,

22:12.790 --> 22:15.059

brother, im ok with it.
