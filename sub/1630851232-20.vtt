The board is scrambling,
HCC is doing damage control,

39:27.669 --> 39:29.584

until these employees

39:29.628 --> 39:32.152
come back,
this hospital can't operate.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.328
You're shut down
from top to bottom.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.417
And that has
never happened before.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.985

"essential workers."
