WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.640 --> 00:12.245
Six years ago,
the Geordie Squad first got together.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.650
But it's not all been one big party.

00:17.717 --> 00:19.652
Back to work.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.389
We've had to work
for that wrinkly fuck Anna.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.726
But we fucking nailed it.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.295
# Any cock's good
When it's cock, cock, cock #

00:31.231 --> 00:34.200
We've only gone and made
her business a global success.

00:35.402 --> 00:38.438
So now the squad is expanding.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.107
Oi, oi!
Hello!

00:41.174 --> 00:44.077
(cheering)

00:49.416 --> 00:52.519
I'm not gonna be able
to keep all yous all on full-time.

00:52.585 --> 00:57.991
We need to help Anna decide
who stays and who goes.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.529
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:02.595 --> 01:05.298
Are they fucking radge enough...

01:05.364 --> 01:08.067
To join this crazy family?

01:14.107 --> 01:15.708
Let wor fuckin gan.

01:17.210 --> 01:20.013
I can't believe Anna's
sending us to France for work.

01:20.079 --> 01:22.649
I've never been skiing before.
(all cheering)

01:22.715 --> 01:24.684
Fuck! The mannequin's moving?

01:24.751 --> 01:28.021
(screaming)
It's Scott!

01:28.087 --> 01:31.057
All the way from the Toon
with his big fucking baguette.

01:31.124 --> 01:33.026
Bonjour.
Anna's on the phone.

01:33.092 --> 01:35.695
"Elettra won't be coming."
Anna, how could you?

01:35.762 --> 01:37.464
She was probably gonna marry us.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.900
Marnie won't be in France for days.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.803
The newbies have arrived in Tignes.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.372
So these must be the newbies. Hello.

01:47.707 --> 01:50.543
The minute I saw Scott,
I fancied him.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.246
Scott has already got his tongue
in my throat.

01:54.347 --> 01:55.949
Whoa!

01:56.015 --> 01:58.918
Me and Marty are getting on so good.
I'm just so happy.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.389
I'm absolutely blind drunk.
(retches)

02:03.456 --> 02:05.558
Me trainer! Really?

02:05.625 --> 02:07.193
Get out, get out, Sam.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.597
Abbie is looking naughty tonight.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.933
I knew it. Abbie, is all over Scott.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.104
There's only one thing on my mind,
and that's Scotty's package.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.144
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.480
Never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:27.547 --> 02:30.183
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.652
Get me in.
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.721
I'm preened to perfection.

02:34.787 --> 02:37.156
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:37.223 --> 02:40.026
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.962
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:43.029 --> 02:45.965
My quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.835
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

02:57.744 --> 03:00.480
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Oh, my God, is that a joke?

03:00.547 --> 03:01.814
Morning, sister!

03:01.881 --> 03:04.117
Last night Chloe stayed
in Martin's room.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.185
And I hope that nothing happened,

03:06.252 --> 03:08.855
because she is soft as shite
when it comes to him.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.224
No, no kissing, no...
Fingering?

03:11.291 --> 03:12.759
No...
Nipple touching?

03:12.825 --> 03:15.061
No.
OK, well, that's fine, then.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.297
Me and Marty are in a good place.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.532
I'm so happy
nothing happened last night

03:19.599 --> 03:22.669
because I'm enjoying me and him
just being best friends.

03:22.735 --> 03:25.138
Sarah was hard work last night.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.640
And she was one
of my favourites as well.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.109
Sarah had an emotional breakdown
last night

03:30.176 --> 03:32.545
because Scott and Abbie
went to the shag pad.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.247
She can't live in this house

03:34.314 --> 03:37.584
if all she's gonna do is cry
over boys that she's getting with.

03:37.650 --> 03:41.454
She was very, very drunk,
and I think she's very emotional,

03:41.521 --> 03:44.490
and she let her emotions
get the better of her.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.728
I've just woke up
and my head is banging.

03:48.795 --> 03:51.397
I can't remember
a thing from last night.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.606
I wanna laugh,
but, Sam, you threw up in my trainer.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.040
(squirting)

04:01.107 --> 04:03.443
Sam was trying to show off
last night

04:03.509 --> 04:06.412
and by doing that,
he was sick in Gary's trainer.

04:06.479 --> 04:09.916
Gaz is fucking fuming.
He was sick in me fucking trainer.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.485
Hey theres.

04:15.121 --> 04:18.658
Scott didn't wake up in my room,
and if he's not in the boys' room,

04:18.725 --> 04:21.761
that can only mean one thing.
He's with Abbie.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.164
(laughs)

04:25.231 --> 04:27.333
Abbie plus Scott equals Scabbie.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.802
I couldn't think
of a fucking worse name.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.671
Scabbie, that's a belter, that.

04:32.672 --> 04:35.908
I've woke up with Abbie.
I might not have went all the way.

04:35.975 --> 04:39.612
On the bright side, I've managed
to get a naughty tan on my fingers.

04:41.948 --> 04:47.286
I'm absolutely hanging. I'm a bit
nervous to go in the newbies' room.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.789
But at the end of the day
I do like Scott,

04:49.856 --> 04:52.125
and in this house,
you can't blame anyone.

04:55.528 --> 04:57.664
You could cut the tension
with a knife.

04:57.730 --> 05:01.100
Sarah and Zahida
are definitely not talking to us.

05:01.167 --> 05:04.904
If she wants to be that girl that
disregards your friends' feelings

05:04.971 --> 05:07.974
for a fucking cock, then see
how far that gets you in life.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.308
It doesn't get you far.

05:09.375 --> 05:12.545
Abbie chose a lad over me,
and she's meant to be me friend.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.847
This could get a little bit awkward.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.787
Dirty stop out.
Did you get the finger?

05:20.853 --> 05:23.423
Yeah, I got the finger
and I felt his cock.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.458
Very banana-shaped, isn't it?
Yeah.

05:25.525 --> 05:28.094
I need to tell you.
Be careful with Scott,

05:28.161 --> 05:30.296
cos he is only out for a shag.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.932
Abbie needs to take my advice
more than anyone.

05:32.999 --> 05:37.136
I've been there. Scotty will
flirt you, shag you and pie you off.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.005
It's literally his religion.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.642
He's a professional.
He just likes to shag.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.278
You can get the finger.
Finger's nowt, man.

05:45.344 --> 05:48.014
There's nowt wrong with a finger.
Finger's nowt.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.052
(laughs)

05:53.119 --> 05:55.088
(phone rings)
Me, me, me, me, me.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.724
Me, me, me, me, me.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.326
Marty's Heating Solutions.
How may I help you?

06:00.393 --> 06:02.862
Surprise, surprise.
Anna's on the blower.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.731
This can only be one of two things.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.600
Someone's going home
or someone's going to work.

06:07.667 --> 06:12.138
"Listen, you've got work to do. You,
Scotty, Nathan and all the newbies."

06:12.205 --> 06:15.241
Me, Scott, Nathan
and all the newbies.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.677
"I'm sending you snow tubing."

06:17.744 --> 06:20.847
"I'm testing a new activity
for Geordie Tours abroad."

06:20.913 --> 06:22.949
Right.
"And don't forget,

06:23.015 --> 06:26.786
I'm looking for a worker to become
a permanent member of the family."

06:26.853 --> 06:28.821
Thank you.
"Speak to you soon."

06:28.888 --> 06:30.857
Speak to you soon. Ta-ra.

06:30.923 --> 06:34.227
Nice one, Anna. I can't wait
to play third wheel with Scabbie

06:34.293 --> 06:35.328
at work today.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.363
I deserve a fucking promotion.

06:37.430 --> 06:41.534
Me, Scott, Nathan and all the
newbies, we're all going to graft.

06:41.601 --> 06:44.537
Thanks, Anna.
You've stitched us right up there.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.973
I just hope
it's not gonna be awkward.

06:50.810 --> 06:51.978
Oh, oh, oh.

06:52.044 --> 06:55.414
Everyone is chilling, playing
a game of pool and I'm loving it.

06:57.016 --> 06:58.985
Oh, shit.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.921
Hiya!
(cheering)

07:01.988 --> 07:03.956
Here she is. Better late than never.

07:04.023 --> 07:07.093
I'm not gonna lie, it's always
good to see Marnie's face.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.195
How are you? Whoo!

07:10.596 --> 07:12.165
(all laugh)

07:14.467 --> 07:16.302
I am buzzing that Marnie's back.

07:16.369 --> 07:19.338
I just hope it doesn't go
back to how it was in Newcastle.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.207
Aaron, you need to get over her.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.210
Move on, go on the pull,
you're in Tignes.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.146
Hiya, how are you doing?
Where have you been?

07:27.213 --> 07:28.981
Scott's back, what the hell?

07:29.048 --> 07:32.652
I can't believe it. I can tell
that Tignes is gonna be amazing.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.821
I haven't missed much, have I?
A bit.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.924
Anna's making me go to work,
when all I wanna do

07:37.990 --> 07:40.760
is catch up with Marnie
and bitch and talk shit.

07:40.827 --> 07:42.662
Right, come on. Newbies, come on.

07:42.728 --> 07:43.763
Go fuck off.

07:43.830 --> 07:48.000
Everyone who's gotta go to work
can fuck right off and enjoy it,

07:48.067 --> 07:51.003
because I'm gonna be having
a catch-up with me cousin.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.072
(chatter, laughter)

07:56.576 --> 08:00.847
We're going to work, and I'm so glad
I've got Scotty and Nathan,

08:00.913 --> 08:03.983
cos I'm not going to get two
words out of Sarah or Zahida.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.921
So glad to have you back.
I missed you.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.291
I'm so glad to see Marnie,
but there's so much to catch up on.

08:12.358 --> 08:15.261
She won't believe
what the newbies have been up to.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.198
The first night the newbies got here,
Sarah got with Scott,

08:19.265 --> 08:22.001
but then Abbie's always fancied him,
so last night,

08:22.068 --> 08:24.804
Abbie and Scott slept together.
She got fingered.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.505
How many fingers she had now?

08:26.572 --> 08:28.307
She's definitely had a Kit-Kat!

08:28.374 --> 08:29.842
(they laugh)

08:29.909 --> 08:32.445
Sarah and Zahida
aren't talking to Abbie.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.179
So who's she got? No-one?

08:34.246 --> 08:37.383
God can only imagine how awkward
that must be for her.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.184
I bet she's having a nightmare.

08:39.251 --> 08:42.020
I feel sorry.
She must be on her own. It is hard.

08:42.087 --> 08:45.892
Enough of the newbies,
I need to tell Marnie about Aaron.

08:45.958 --> 08:49.629
Marnie, all he's talked about
being here is you.

08:49.695 --> 08:53.299
He's constantly on nights out
saying, "Where's my Marn?"

08:53.366 --> 08:55.801
Aaron might think
I'm his Marnie, but I'm not.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.303
I've got a boyfriend now.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.106
Me and Aaron are friends
and he has to live with that.

09:00.172 --> 09:03.209
He says all this to you,
but where's the actions?

09:03.276 --> 09:05.745
He talks,
but he doesn't act the right way.

09:09.415 --> 09:11.484
Today is all about
testing activities

09:11.550 --> 09:13.586
for potential stag and hen dos.

09:13.653 --> 09:17.657
How hard can it be to sit
on your arse and slide down a hill?

09:17.723 --> 09:19.759
I hope Anna is impressed with this.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.527
(screaming)

09:21.594 --> 09:24.330
Fuck off! See yous all in a bit!

09:24.397 --> 09:26.332
I can't believe this is work.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.368
All we're doing is flying down hills
on rubber rings.

09:29.435 --> 09:31.404
And people wonder why I love work.

09:31.470 --> 09:34.340
Holy fuck, I've hurt my arse.
Oh, shit!

09:34.407 --> 09:36.309
That wasn't even scary,

09:36.375 --> 09:39.345
and I'm fuming
because I'm covered in fucking snow.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.247
I'm frozen.
Fuck's sake.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.882
I'm not doing that again.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.620
Scott has been flirting with us,

09:47.687 --> 09:50.323
and I can feel the daggers
coming from Sarah.

09:50.389 --> 09:53.459
At the end of the day,
if I stopped cracking on with Scott,

09:53.526 --> 09:57.029
she's still gonna be angry
so it's a lose-lose situation.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.532
Did you enjoy last night?
That was all right.

09:59.598 --> 10:02.735
Them two after last night
haven't spoken to me at all.

10:02.802 --> 10:05.705
They're totally ignoring us.
Why are they doing that?

10:05.771 --> 10:08.441
I understand that Zahida
is Sarah's mate and that,

10:08.507 --> 10:10.876
but it's nowt with her.
I can't be arsed.

10:10.943 --> 10:11.978
I just laugh.

10:12.044 --> 10:14.680
Not the first time birds
have fallen out over me.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.215
It's not gonna be the last.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.818
Abbie's has to deal with it
or let it go.

10:18.884 --> 10:21.487
And I fucking bet any money
she cannot let it go.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.524
(chuckles) You would?

10:25.591 --> 10:26.826
Would you?
No.

10:26.892 --> 10:29.962
Wouldn't you?
Not when you look like that.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.130
Give me a kiss.

10:32.331 --> 10:35.334
Daft cunt.
I am really into Scott.

10:35.401 --> 10:39.638
But people have been warning me,
so I do need to be wary.

10:39.705 --> 10:40.873
Come here.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.878
Deep throat it.

10:45.945 --> 10:49.749
After that shit show of work,
let's get back to the chalet

10:49.815 --> 10:51.484
and get out for the night.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.894
It's my first night in France. I
need to make sure I look super sexy.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.196
I just can't wait to hit the town.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.699
Sophie, are you still alive?

11:06.766 --> 11:08.167
I've got diarrhoea.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.268
(gasps)

11:09.335 --> 11:11.370
Everybody's getting ready,

11:11.437 --> 11:15.341
and I'm sitting
on the fucking toilet.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.609
It's a bad one.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.545
What are you going to do?
I'm not gonna be able to come.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.680
I'm gonna miss out
on so much tonight.

11:21.747 --> 11:26.318
I'd love to see Scott, Abbie
and Sarah with the love triangle.

11:26.385 --> 11:28.788
Oh, my God, I have to go.
She's going again.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.157
Ooh.

11:38.764 --> 11:42.668
Does Sam honestly think
he can be sick in my shoe

11:42.735 --> 11:45.838
and there's gonna be no
repercussions? It's prank time.

11:45.905 --> 11:48.908
You wanna make drinks,
pretend they're cocktails.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.644
You're gonna come in
and put an egg in Sam's drink.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.579
OK, I just hope
I don't fuck this up.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.749
Obviously, Sam would suspect me
if I handed him a drink,

11:56.816 --> 12:00.086
but he will never ever
expect it from Nathan.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.421
We're gonna get Nathan
to make cocktails,

12:02.488 --> 12:04.824
but make Sam's extra special.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.025
Right, OK.

12:08.727 --> 12:11.997
Do you think it's weird
Abbie is not getting ready with us?

12:12.064 --> 12:13.999
Abbie is nowhere to be seen.

12:14.066 --> 12:18.104
She's clearly avoiding wor, but
I don't wanna look at her anyway.

12:18.170 --> 12:21.440
So what's the game plan tonight?
I'm gonna have a good night.

12:21.507 --> 12:22.975
I'm not gonna cry.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.643
Ever since I've joined,

12:24.710 --> 12:28.581
all Sarah's done is cry over boys
that treat her like shit.

12:28.647 --> 12:32.318
Stay away from Scott and Martin
and sort things out with Abbie.

12:32.384 --> 12:35.054
If you cry tonight,
I'm going to swill you.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.455
(chuckles)

12:38.524 --> 12:42.061
The boys are in the front room,
so it's operation a go.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.596
I'm gonna have to do it fast.

12:46.232 --> 12:49.702
Scott, Aaron, Sam, Marty,
you want a vodka and Coke?

12:49.768 --> 12:50.836
Yes, please.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.641
I can see in Nathan's face

12:55.708 --> 12:59.211
how excited he is
to be involved in the prank,

12:59.278 --> 13:00.746
not getting pranked.

13:00.813 --> 13:03.649
One, two, three.
Thanks for having me back, boys.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.252
Cheers to this one!
Hope you like your drinks!

13:06.318 --> 13:08.120
(gags)

13:08.187 --> 13:10.022
Sam looks like
he's gonna be sick.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.658
His face is a fucking picture.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.426
(gags, coughs)

13:14.493 --> 13:17.396
I'm trying to neck me drink.
My stomach can't handle it.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.398
There's definitely something up.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.602
That's for whiting in me trainer.
(they laugh)

13:23.669 --> 13:25.271
Yes, Nathan, well done, son!

13:27.072 --> 13:29.642
It's Marnie's first night back.
Let's smash it!

13:31.210 --> 13:33.746
Aaron is he's happy to see us.
I hope that lasts.

13:35.047 --> 13:37.683
Marty has took all the rap
and I'm buzzing.

13:37.750 --> 13:41.187
You're a fucking idiot, man!
What the fuck is going on?

13:41.253 --> 13:44.490
If we're good friends,
you would have more respect for me.

13:44.557 --> 13:48.227
I'm living in a house with two exes
and I've got to go on like I'm fine.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.795
Ah, fuck!

13:50.429 --> 13:52.431
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

13:55.000 --> 13:55.201
.

13:57.703 --> 13:57.903
.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.478
(loud cheering)

14:06.545 --> 14:09.848
Let's have a massive cheers.
It's Marnie's first night back.

14:09.915 --> 14:13.118
Cheers to Marnie's first night!
(cheering)

14:15.955 --> 14:17.323
Come on, bitches!

14:20.359 --> 14:21.627
We've just rocked up.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.531
It's time to get inside,
get pissed and get my freak on.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.176
Abbie and Scott
are all over each other.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.878
Clearly they don't
give a shit about Sarah.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.748
Sarah needs to stop worrying
about Scott and move on.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.822
I'm not enjoying
watching Scabbie tonight

14:49.888 --> 14:51.657
and I'm feeling really lonely.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.327
So I'm going to talk to Marty
because at least he understands us.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.803
I do feel sorry for Sarah.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.439
She's been fucked over
by her mate and Scott.

15:07.506 --> 15:10.242
It's a shit situation
and I wanna be there for her.

15:20.886 --> 15:23.289
It is nice that
me and Martin get along.

15:23.355 --> 15:27.059
And I never thought
we'd be bonding over boy problems.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.495
He's stepping up
and being there for us.

15:36.135 --> 15:39.405
I've just seen Sarah and Martin
having a heart-to-heart.

15:39.471 --> 15:43.108
I don't understand why
she keeps going to him for comfort

15:43.175 --> 15:44.877
when he's treated her so badly.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.212
I find it really frustrating.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.456
I understand why Sarah goes to Marty
when she's upset,

15:57.523 --> 16:01.327
cos I've been there. But, Sarah,
it's a lose-lose situation.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.870
I can't watch any more of this.
I'm going to talk to Sarah.

16:30.289 --> 16:33.492
I do get why Zahida's
concerned about me and Martin,

16:33.559 --> 16:36.562
because she's seen wor fall out
so many times in the past.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.897
But I've got bigger things
to worry about.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.266
I wish she'd be there for us
through that.

16:47.473 --> 16:50.442
Abbie's really stubborn
and so is Sarah.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.445
If I don't make them talk,
it's never going to happen.

16:58.884 --> 17:03.021
I've got no problem talking to Sarah,
but she hasn't even looked at us,

17:03.088 --> 17:05.190
and I just wanted to find
the right time.

17:23.675 --> 17:27.646
I can see Zahida and Abbie arguing
so I thought, yeah, I'll walk over.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.181
I'll try and calm her down.

17:29.248 --> 17:31.850
Then I thought,
"Fuck this, they're going acka!"

17:37.990 --> 17:40.159
Martin's telling me
not to get involved,

17:40.225 --> 17:42.127
but I have more of a right than him.

17:42.194 --> 17:45.130
One, Sarah's me best mate.
Two, I share a room with them.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.936
Whilst these two are going at it
like a couple ferrets,

17:51.003 --> 17:55.073
I'm gonna chat to Sarah. She's
sound, and you might need a backup.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.722
I'm telling Sarah
I want nothing to do with her

18:10.789 --> 18:12.291
because she likes Marty.

18:12.357 --> 18:16.028
She's crying cos I've just mentioned
his name. It proves me point.

18:23.435 --> 18:27.406
Why the fuck is Scott turning
this around, making it about Marty?

18:27.473 --> 18:31.043
He got with me on the first night
and then with me friend on the next.

18:31.109 --> 18:34.379
Now he's trying to blame it
on the fact that I still like Marty.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.814
What a head fuck.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.692
My head is absolutely blagged,

18:46.758 --> 18:50.362
and Abbie thinks it's
the perfect time to bounce over.

18:56.835 --> 18:59.972
I've just walked over to Sarah
cos I want to sort things out,

19:00.038 --> 19:03.008
but she's just walked off.
What more can I do?

19:10.849 --> 19:12.651
Sarah is a fucking lunatic.

19:12.718 --> 19:15.921
She's necked on with Scott once
and trying to claim him.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.358
That's not the case. Scott will do
whatever he wants to do,

19:19.424 --> 19:21.693
and at the minute,
he wants to do Abbie.

19:26.198 --> 19:29.601
I'm just in this club,
minding my own goddamn business,

19:29.668 --> 19:32.771
and people are screaming,
people are shouting.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.007
What the fuck is going on?

19:37.609 --> 19:40.345
Ah, here we go.
The girls have started kicking off.

19:40.412 --> 19:44.049
They do realise they can make life
easier if they all work together.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.685
Have they never heard
of menage a trois?

19:51.089 --> 19:55.527
I think Sarah is confused and
her emotions are all over the place.

19:55.594 --> 19:59.531
But what is the question? Does she
like Scott or does she like Marty?

20:06.972 --> 20:09.841
Fuck it, I'm gonna talk to Marnie.

20:09.908 --> 20:12.544
I'm happy she's back
and I haven't spoken to her.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.283
Aaron says he's happy to see us.

20:18.350 --> 20:22.254
I just hope that lasts and
we're not at each other's throats.

20:28.026 --> 20:30.929
I love Aaron and Marnie
when they're together,

20:30.996 --> 20:32.798
either as best friends or lovers.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.801
So I just want them
to get back to how they were before.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.987
Being a couple and living together
was way too hard.

20:55.053 --> 20:58.156
Maybe in different circumstances
we could have worked.

20:58.223 --> 21:00.392
The best we can hope for
is to be friends.

21:02.628 --> 21:06.131
I'm happy Marnie's back.
Whatever's happened in the past,

21:06.198 --> 21:08.333
we're mates
and I don't wanna lose that.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.801
(laughs)
What?

21:16.174 --> 21:18.043
I've known Sarah for years

21:18.110 --> 21:21.680
and I've watched her get her heart
broken again and again by Martin,

21:21.747 --> 21:23.415
and I'm not standing for it.

21:28.353 --> 21:32.524
How the hell has all this happened
after only being away for two days?

21:32.591 --> 21:33.725
I can't keep up!

21:35.794 --> 21:40.165
The girls are kicking off and I've
managed to get out of it... again.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.901
Marty's took the rap
and I'm fucking buzzing.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.636
Why? Cos I'm Scotty Fucking T.

21:50.075 --> 21:52.344
Hang on a minute.
What have I done wrong?

21:52.411 --> 21:54.246
Shouldn't she be swilling Scott?

22:00.686 --> 22:03.789
I can't believe Zahida
has just swilled Marty.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.424
What is going on?!

22:08.126 --> 22:11.363
The good thing about tonight
is me and Marnie have made up.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.498
The rest was an absolute shambles.

22:13.565 --> 22:16.068
Let's get out
and get back to the chalet.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.081
I'm gonna be sick.

22:29.147 --> 22:32.584
We get back to the chalet,
I thought I was OK,

22:32.651 --> 22:34.686
but I'm absolutely mortal.

22:34.753 --> 22:39.391
The only conversation I'm going to
be having tonight is with the toilet.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.961
I was hoping to take Abbie
to the shag pad,

22:43.028 --> 22:46.531
but there's no chance of that.
The lass is mortal on the floor.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.166
Fuck this. I'm off to bed.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.444
What the fuck is Sarah playing at,

22:59.511 --> 23:02.814
going to Marty for a heart-to-heart?
She will never learn.

23:05.584 --> 23:09.654
Zahida has been a proper bell-end,
but I'll deal with her tomorrow.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.357
Right now,
I've gotta deal with a drunk Sarah.

23:12.424 --> 23:16.294
Scott seems to think I'm to blame
for you being this upset.

23:16.361 --> 23:17.963
I have said to him, though,

23:18.029 --> 23:20.932
that, like, because of the way
that we were in the past

23:20.999 --> 23:24.736
and that was my last relationship,
that is why I am this fucked up.

23:24.803 --> 23:27.739
Martin, you cheated on us
with so many girls.

23:27.806 --> 23:30.575
Sarah, that was fucking years ago.
I know! I know!

23:30.642 --> 23:33.278
I'm trying to comfort Sarah
about Scott,

23:33.345 --> 23:37.382
and she's is bringing up the past.
It was about five fucking years ago.

23:37.449 --> 23:39.584
Build a bridge and walk over it.

23:39.651 --> 23:42.454
Now I'm a different person.
I grew up.

23:42.521 --> 23:46.358
I promise I care about how you feel.
I don't want you to be this upset.

23:46.424 --> 23:51.062
The only way I can describe
how I feel about Martin is confused.

23:51.129 --> 23:54.466
It's not a normal thing to be
in a house with your ex-boyfriend.

23:54.533 --> 23:57.836
It was years ago now.
I know, but I've never been...

24:05.277 --> 24:07.746
Martin, I need to speak to you.

24:07.813 --> 24:11.216
I've only just finished
wiping the tears off one ex

24:11.283 --> 24:13.218
and now Chloe's calling us over.

24:13.285 --> 24:17.889
Let's just hope this chat is easier
than the one I've had with Sarah.

24:17.956 --> 24:20.859
It's not exactly a candlelit dinner,
is it?

24:20.926 --> 24:23.328
I feel like it's weird
having Marty's ex here

24:23.395 --> 24:25.864
cos in this house,
he's always been mine,

24:25.931 --> 24:27.966
and with her here,
I feel that he's not.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.569
Obviously, I am 100% over you.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.038
I know, it seems like that.
Yeah.

24:33.104 --> 24:34.806
Sometimes I feel like,

24:34.873 --> 24:38.543
if we were such good friends,
you would have more respect for me.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.246
How can I be good friends
with two exes, really?

24:41.313 --> 24:44.482
Cos I do class you as an ex.
Cos you said that you don't care!

24:44.549 --> 24:46.852
Listen,
this is what's fucking me off.

24:46.918 --> 24:49.621
Because I'm getting
the same thing from Sarah.

24:49.688 --> 24:51.857
I need to be respectful to you
and Sarah.

24:51.923 --> 24:55.861
Reassure the both of yous. How can
I do that all in one fucking day?

24:55.927 --> 25:00.165
I'm living in a house with two exes
and I've got to go on like I'm fine,

25:00.232 --> 25:01.399
and I find it hard.

25:01.466 --> 25:04.469
Understand,
your ex has come in this house.

25:04.536 --> 25:09.541
It's very, very hard to me.
(laughs) It's hard for you, is it?

25:09.608 --> 25:11.776
Nice one. Ah!

25:11.843 --> 25:13.044
Hello!

25:14.946 --> 25:16.748
Listen.
I'm not being funny.

25:16.815 --> 25:19.050
No, no, no. Let me speak a second.

25:19.117 --> 25:21.386
No, let Sarah speak!
I would like to speak.

25:21.453 --> 25:24.489
Are you fucking kidding me?
I've had enough of this shit.

25:24.556 --> 25:25.624
I'm going to bed.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.964
Tonight has been shit.
Nothing's been sorted out.

25:33.031 --> 25:36.434
Everything's got worse.
I wonder what tomorrow will be like.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.804
Ah, fucking hell!

25:48.113 --> 25:50.582
Do you think
you've ever properly moved on?

25:50.649 --> 25:52.250
She has feelings for him.

25:52.317 --> 25:55.120
I think he's a lot happier
that you are here now.

25:55.186 --> 25:58.556
I like to think that me and Aaron
could get back to a place we were.

25:58.623 --> 26:02.360
(shouting)
I feel like Jack Frost.

26:02.427 --> 26:05.563
I want Marnie
to look at you pulling a bird.

26:05.630 --> 26:08.333
There's more to life than Marnie!

26:08.733 --> 26:10.735
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

26:13.471 --> 26:13.672
.

26:16.207 --> 26:16.408
.

26:28.887 --> 26:31.323
Morning.
What happened last night?

26:31.389 --> 26:33.325
I want to die. Who wants to tell her?

26:33.391 --> 26:35.660
I'm actually really excited
to find out

26:35.727 --> 26:37.829
what the hell
was going on last night.

26:37.896 --> 26:40.332
It started from,
Scott was speaking to Abbie,

26:40.398 --> 26:44.369
Sarah was speaking to Marty.
Like, something was gonna go down.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.172
Last night,
Scott, Abbie and Sarah were arguing,

26:47.238 --> 26:50.308
and before we knew it,
Zahida was going in on Marty.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.043
The girl went fucking berserk.

26:52.110 --> 26:55.213
Zahida was obviously
sticking up for Sarah,

26:55.280 --> 26:58.683
and she started saying things
to Martin and Zahida swilled him.

26:59.985 --> 27:02.887
I can totally understand.
I know what that's like.

27:02.954 --> 27:06.624
When he used to hurt you,
we got angry like she does.

27:06.691 --> 27:08.159
I know her pain there.

27:08.226 --> 27:11.363
When Chloe and Marty were together
and Marty upset Chloe,

27:11.429 --> 27:15.100
it used to upset us, so I totally
get where Zahida's coming from.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.869
She's got to let Sarah
make her own mistakes.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.572
Did Sarah talk
to Abbie and Scott?

27:20.638 --> 27:23.041
Oh, it kicked off
between them as well.

27:23.108 --> 27:27.712
We're confused. Who is it she's
arguing with? Scott, or is it Marty?

27:34.152 --> 27:38.857
There's so much tension in the house
and I know I need to speak to Sarah,

27:38.923 --> 27:41.159
but it's best
if I leave it a little longer.

27:44.229 --> 27:46.197
What the fuck happened?!

27:46.264 --> 27:50.068
Last night, nothing got resolved
between Sarah and Abbie.

27:50.135 --> 27:52.937
And to make things worse,
I swilled Martin.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.206
I'm going
to keep my head down today.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.308
I remember crying.

27:58.243 --> 28:01.146
I know it was to do
with Abbie and Scott.

28:01.212 --> 28:04.182
I've woke up this morning
and I feel physically ill.

28:04.249 --> 28:08.053
It's all a bit blurry, but
I know there was lots of kick-offs,

28:08.119 --> 28:09.421
and I was in the centre.

28:09.487 --> 28:12.624
I do like Scott
and Scott doesn't see it

28:12.690 --> 28:14.926
because he says
that I still like Martin.

28:14.993 --> 28:17.529
Do you think
you've ever properly moved on?

28:17.595 --> 28:20.298
(sighs) It's confusing for meself.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.934
After the way Sarah was
with Martin last night,

28:23.001 --> 28:27.238
I know she still has feelings for
him, whether she admits it or not.

28:27.305 --> 28:30.108
We broke up.
We were never friends after that.

28:30.175 --> 28:33.478
This is like us trying to be
friends, and we've never done that.

28:33.545 --> 28:37.382
We need to learn how to be friends
and not exes.

28:37.449 --> 28:40.685
Me and Martin didn't end
on civil terms.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.788
We ended because he fucked
loads of girls behind me back.

28:43.855 --> 28:46.424
And the way I dealt with that
was I shut him out.

28:46.491 --> 28:50.695
This is now unfinished business
and I'm forced to face it head on.

28:54.132 --> 28:57.302
You all right?
I feel like shit.

28:57.368 --> 28:59.804
Where do I start?
What do you mean?

28:59.871 --> 29:03.041
What was with your lasses?
I don't know what's happened.

29:03.108 --> 29:06.077
I've got Zahida involved
where she's not needed.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.213
I've got Sarah
proper confiding in us.

29:08.279 --> 29:11.282
I've got Chloe getting jealous,
so she's giving us shit.

29:11.349 --> 29:13.184
I'm trying to do the right thing.

29:13.251 --> 29:16.454
If Sarah and Zahida went,
everything would be perfect.

29:16.521 --> 29:19.424
Chloe wouldn't be jealous,
Zahida wouldn't kick off,

29:19.491 --> 29:21.926
and Sarah wouldn't be bringing up
the past.

29:21.993 --> 29:25.563
My head's just scrambled now.
Scrambled head, mate.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.999
Just get to
the Scotty T School of Training.

29:28.066 --> 29:30.535
You away with everything
"Scott" free!

29:41.846 --> 29:45.416
After last night, let's just
pie off snowboarding and skiing.

29:45.483 --> 29:47.852
Everyone get out
and do something together.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.454
Yeah.
Yeah.

29:49.521 --> 29:53.958
There's so much tension, we need to
do something fun and all together

29:54.025 --> 29:55.160
to get rid of it.

29:55.226 --> 29:57.929
Let's get in the snow and have fun.
(cheering)

30:03.768 --> 30:06.604
No matter how old you are,
when you're around snow,

30:06.671 --> 30:08.072
the inner child comes out.

30:17.348 --> 30:18.816
How's that for a head?

30:18.883 --> 30:21.286
This is the first time
I've made snowmen,

30:21.352 --> 30:23.655
and I tell you,
it's not gonna be the last.

30:23.721 --> 30:25.890
It's mint! I feel like Jack Frost!

30:26.925 --> 30:27.959
Whoa!

30:29.093 --> 30:33.131
I'm with Marnie, and the last thing
that we wanna do is build snowmans.

30:33.198 --> 30:36.768
Then all of a sudden,
it is snowman sabotage.

30:40.505 --> 30:43.174
I can't feel me fingers.
I can't feel me nose.

30:43.241 --> 30:46.744
So I need to get out of this
fucking snow and into the warmth.

30:52.650 --> 30:55.420
We get back and did Scott say
he's cooking dinner?!

30:55.486 --> 30:56.721
I'm all for this.

30:56.788 --> 30:59.157
What are you making?
A beef hotpot.

30:59.224 --> 31:01.826
You haven't got to try
and impress the girls.

31:01.893 --> 31:05.129
Just graft them like we used to.
(laughs)

31:05.196 --> 31:07.465
Gaz reckons I'm cooking
to impress Abbie.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.201
Mate, I don't need
to impress Abbie with a beef stew

31:10.268 --> 31:13.204
when I've got half a fucking cow
hanging in me kegs.

31:13.271 --> 31:15.440
(phone rings)

31:15.506 --> 31:18.610
And the f-f-f-fucking phone
is ringing.

31:18.676 --> 31:20.178
Bonjour, Anna.

31:20.245 --> 31:22.213
"Hi, how are you?"

31:22.280 --> 31:26.117
"I'm just ringing for a catch-up to
see how the newbies are getting on."

31:26.184 --> 31:28.920
Oh, erm...

31:28.987 --> 31:32.924
Shit, I keep forgetting we're
supposed to be giving Anna feedback

31:32.991 --> 31:35.126
so she can decide who's staying.

31:35.193 --> 31:36.961
None of these newbies are safe.

31:37.028 --> 31:40.465
"It is important you let us know
who the strongest workers are."

31:40.531 --> 31:43.067
"I only want the best
back in Newcastle."

31:43.134 --> 31:46.170
I know, but we're struggling
between us to make a decision

31:46.237 --> 31:50.174
and we just need to, like,
judge them a little bit more.

31:50.241 --> 31:53.544
Everything is constantly changing.
None of wor can agree.

31:53.611 --> 31:55.079
This is gonna be difficult.

31:55.146 --> 31:59.250
"All right, make sure you don't
get in any trouble tonight, OK?"

31:59.317 --> 32:02.220
Obviously. Bye!
(they all say goodbye)

32:02.287 --> 32:06.057
So what do you think?
We can't make a decision between us?

32:06.124 --> 32:08.860
It's hard to think we're
gonna be losing one of them,

32:08.926 --> 32:12.130
so it's best to forget about it
so we can have a wicked night.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.507
Abbie, you feel all right?

32:22.573 --> 32:25.376
The last thing I want
is Abbie to feel uncomfortable.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.979
I'm happy she got ready
with us and Nathan.

32:28.046 --> 32:30.481
Is it still a bit awkward
for the situation?

32:30.548 --> 32:32.917
Have you still not spoken to them?
Nah.

32:32.984 --> 32:35.987
I feel bad for Abbie.
She's got nothing to worry about.

32:36.054 --> 32:37.855
She can just be new mates with us.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.526
How's you and Aaron, Marnie?
Good, getting on.

32:41.592 --> 32:43.428
I can tell you're getting on.

32:43.494 --> 32:46.798
I think he's a lot happier
that you're here now, you know.

32:46.864 --> 32:50.568
I'd like to think that me and Aaron
could get back to the place we were.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.838
I am happy that we're speaking,
so let's see how it goes.

32:56.908 --> 32:59.377
Getting ready,
I've decided I'm gonna doll up

32:59.444 --> 33:02.980
and have meself a really good night
and I'm not gonna cry.

33:03.047 --> 33:05.583
Beautiful lass, beautiful curl.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.652
What's happening? You ready?

33:07.719 --> 33:12.156
My priority tonight
is getting Aaron a bird.

33:12.223 --> 33:13.825
I want him to get over Marnie.

33:13.891 --> 33:17.428
I want him to know there's
more to life than Marnie.

33:17.495 --> 33:21.866
I want Marnie to look at you
pulling a bird and be devastated.

33:21.933 --> 33:25.636
When I pulled Chelsea in front of
Marnie, it went completely tits up.

33:25.703 --> 33:28.005
Being friends
means more than pulling,

33:28.072 --> 33:30.608
so I wish Gaz
would stop banging on about it.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.043
Let me get ready, then.

33:34.245 --> 33:37.148
Who is that?!
Oh, my God!

33:37.215 --> 33:38.916
I am so glad I'm finally out.

33:38.983 --> 33:41.786
I've got a really good feeling
about tonight.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.689
The family's back together,
we're all out in force,

33:44.756 --> 33:47.358
so cheers to another night out.

33:47.425 --> 33:48.426
Let's go!

33:49.560 --> 33:52.663
I am in full swing tonight.
I can't wait!

33:55.800 --> 33:58.169
Man's just got to have options!

33:58.236 --> 33:59.504
Here, Nathan.

34:01.706 --> 34:05.443
I'm gonna give it to him straight.
She is mugging you off, mate.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.879
Fuck me, has she just swilled Aaron?

34:07.945 --> 34:09.414
I actually hate you.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.149
Things are heating up.

34:14.318 --> 34:16.320
(all) Geordie Shore! Why-aye!

34:18.956 --> 34:19.157
.

34:21.692 --> 34:21.893
.

34:35.440 --> 34:39.310
I get to the club and I am
in full swing tonight. I can't wait.

34:44.715 --> 34:48.319
(Zahida) I'm having a good night so
far, but I need to talk to Martin.

34:48.386 --> 34:50.822
I want to apologise
for arguing with him.

34:50.888 --> 34:52.690
But I can't keep a straight face

34:52.757 --> 34:56.159
when he's wearing those fucking
ridiculous granddad glasses.

34:58.696 --> 35:01.933
Zahida wants a conversation.
Unless she wants to apologise,

35:01.999 --> 35:03.234
I have nothing to say.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.217
Sarah needs to learn
how to stick up for herself,

35:19.283 --> 35:22.820
but cos she doesn't, I feel like
I need to step in and defend her,

35:22.887 --> 35:26.324
but I don't want to fight any more,
so I hope he accepts my apology.

35:31.529 --> 35:33.464
This house is too small for grudges,

35:33.531 --> 35:36.200
so I'm just gonna accept
the apology and move on.

35:38.436 --> 35:41.906
I'm so glad me and Martin
are back on good terms.

35:41.973 --> 35:45.176
I'm ready to forget
about the arguments and get mortal.

36:05.162 --> 36:07.665
I'm grafting Abbie,
but Sarah is being dodgy,

36:07.732 --> 36:11.002
so I'm going to talk to her.
I can't be arsed with tension.

36:11.068 --> 36:12.670
And she looks all right.

36:26.484 --> 36:28.786
Sarah and Scott
have been having this chat.

36:28.853 --> 36:32.323
I mean, is he apologising to her?
What is she talking about?

36:32.390 --> 36:33.424
I need to know.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.133
Even though Sarah
is pledging her love

36:42.199 --> 36:45.603
I'm not gonna sack her off.
Man's got to have options.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.619
Gary can pull that face
all he wants.

37:01.686 --> 37:04.822
He might not believe me and Aaron
are friends, but I know it.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.724
Aaron knows. That's what matters.

37:13.230 --> 37:16.200
Me and Aaron are in a good place
and I'm so happy about it.

37:16.267 --> 37:18.803
The last thing I wanted
was drama with Aaron.

37:34.185 --> 37:36.821
Finally, Scott's finished
speaking to Sarah,

37:36.887 --> 37:39.457
so I'm going to quiz him
on what's been said.

37:39.523 --> 37:42.159
Hopefully, I don't come across
as too bothered.

37:50.668 --> 37:54.572
I'm not gonna to tell Abbie
that Sarah's pure in love with us.

37:54.639 --> 37:57.208
Abbie should know,
because every fucker is.

38:01.145 --> 38:03.981
I just hope that Scotty
is telling the truth

38:04.048 --> 38:07.151
and he's not saying one thing to me
and the same to Sarah.

38:19.664 --> 38:21.132
It's hard for us newbies.

38:21.198 --> 38:24.335
We've seen some people go
and we know we're not safe.

38:30.908 --> 38:34.145
These newbies are starting to feel
like part of the family.

38:34.211 --> 38:37.848
And it's sad to think that they
could be going home at any time.

38:42.953 --> 38:47.224
I'm buzzing. I don't wanna go home,
and I don't want Sarah to either.

38:47.291 --> 38:48.759
I just hope all the drama

38:48.826 --> 38:51.429
hasn't given the originals
a bad opinion of us.

39:06.310 --> 39:10.147
I don't know what's got into Marnie.
I've never seen her this drunk.

39:11.148 --> 39:13.884
But fuck me,
has she just swilled Aaron?

39:16.387 --> 39:18.522
Me and Marnie are getting on well.

39:18.589 --> 39:22.960
Then she starts kicking off at us.
That girl is a fucking nutcase.

39:28.032 --> 39:31.635
Even though me and Aaron are
friends, there's underlying issues.

39:40.544 --> 39:43.147
It annoyed us that Aaron
didn't stick up for us.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.516
So when I've had a drink,
it comes out.

39:48.686 --> 39:51.622
Marnie, congratulations.

39:51.689 --> 39:54.625
You managed to flirt with Aaron,
stop him from pulling.

39:54.692 --> 39:56.861
You even threw a swill in there
as well.

39:56.927 --> 39:59.196
How the fuck did you pull that off?

40:03.434 --> 40:06.103
Marnie, what the fuck
do you want from me?

40:06.170 --> 40:10.174
You left me, got a new boyfriend,
but you still want my attention.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.109
Sorry, it doesn't work that way.

40:16.046 --> 40:18.482
What I've noticed
with Marnie and Aaron is,

40:18.549 --> 40:21.185
is it can all go tits up
at the flick of a button.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.487
One minute it's good,
one minute it's not.

40:23.554 --> 40:26.123
You can tell
that there's still feelings there.

40:33.631 --> 40:38.769
As Marnie's cousin, my job role has
to be to look after the drunk twat,

40:38.836 --> 40:41.272
so it's off we head,
back to the chalet.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.117
I arrive back at the house
and I want to go straight to bed.

40:53.184 --> 40:56.487
Things with me and Aaron
are more complicated than I thought,

40:56.554 --> 40:58.289
and I can't deal with it tonight.

41:00.024 --> 41:04.361
I will have ketchup on my face
and I'll still look fabulous!

41:05.529 --> 41:06.831
Here, Nathan!

41:08.732 --> 41:10.701
This will make you even fatter!

41:10.768 --> 41:12.937
I'm not fat, bitch. I'm not fat.

41:13.003 --> 41:14.772
I'm not fat.
(laughs)

41:14.839 --> 41:17.007
Oh, my God.

41:17.074 --> 41:22.646
Tignes Nathan is here,
and, fuck me, run while you can.

41:22.713 --> 41:25.683
Nathan! Nathan!
No food fight in the house.

41:25.749 --> 41:28.485
There's no food fighting.
There was one there.

41:28.552 --> 41:31.088
I've learnt
that if I go back with a girl

41:31.155 --> 41:33.891
and spend time
fucking about downstairs,

41:33.958 --> 41:36.126
something will go wrong or kick off.

41:36.193 --> 41:37.828
So I'm not taking any chances.

41:37.895 --> 41:41.198
I'm going upstairs for a one-on-one
with me fucking pipe.

41:41.265 --> 41:43.267
(heavy breathing)

41:44.368 --> 41:45.970
I'm not having sex, Scott.

41:49.306 --> 41:51.642
Things are heating up.

41:51.709 --> 41:55.913
And I know I said I wouldn't have sex
but a 69'er doesn't count, right?

42:02.152 --> 42:03.454
(they laugh)

42:12.496 --> 42:15.466
Now I'm fucking soaking wet.
Soaking wet. Everywhere.

42:15.532 --> 42:18.269
I need to speak to Aaron.
No more pussyfooting.

42:18.335 --> 42:22.039
I'm gonna give it to him straight.
Well, she's mugging you off, mate.

42:23.073 --> 42:24.508
Big time.

42:24.575 --> 42:27.845
She's in control.
She's running the show.

42:27.912 --> 42:32.182
She... has got you
by your fucking balls, mate.

42:32.249 --> 42:33.984
Gaz is fucking going in,

42:34.051 --> 42:36.820
but to be honest,
everything he's saying is right.

42:36.887 --> 42:40.257
Believe me now, Gaz,
tomorrow is a new day,

42:40.324 --> 42:42.693
and me and you
are going straight on the pull.

42:42.760 --> 42:45.296
Yeah, I looked like a cunt.
Of course you did.

42:46.263 --> 42:50.200
You need to stop worrying about her,
cos she does not worry about you.

42:51.368 --> 42:54.638
And for me, as a mate,
it's horrible to fucking watch.

43:00.945 --> 43:04.448
She managed to times one by one
and end up with 69. (laughs)

43:04.515 --> 43:05.983
(howls)

43:06.050 --> 43:09.086
(cheering)
What was I drinking last night?

43:09.153 --> 43:10.287
Go on, son!

43:10.354 --> 43:13.257
This is what I'm talking about.
Top shagger!

43:13.324 --> 43:14.458
(retches)

43:14.525 --> 43:15.726
Whoo!

43:18.829 --> 43:21.799
This can't go on any longer.

43:21.865 --> 43:23.467
Marnie is on a rampage.

43:24.668 --> 43:27.071
I can see Marnie
trying to get me attention.

43:33.110 --> 43:36.347
I think it's more fun
to try and graft every newbie.

43:36.413 --> 43:40.184
What the fuck have I just seen?
Scott and Zahida have just kissed.

43:40.250 --> 43:41.318
(shattering)

43:41.385 --> 43:43.988
All of them are saying
I necked on with Scott.

43:44.054 --> 43:46.824
God. So hard.

44:13.450 --> 44:13.650
.
