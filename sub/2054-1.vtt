00:45.450 --> 00:55.450
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!

01:13.820 --> 01:16.610
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

01:17.110 --> 01:20.490
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.670
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me

01:31.840 --> 01:34.380
you have the wrong man, Bond.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.970
If M was so sure I was bent

01:38.140 --> 01:40.090
she'd have sent a double-0.

01:41.050 --> 01:43.430
Benefits of being section chief

01:43.600 --> 01:46.350
I'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status

01:46.520 --> 01:47.850
wouldn't I?

01:48.940 --> 01:53.480
- Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
- Two.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.420
Shame.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.090
We barely got to know each other.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.340
I know where you keep your gun.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.390
I suppose that's something.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.730
True.

02:28.560 --> 02:29.980
How did he die?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.650
Your contact?

02:32.190 --> 02:33.360
Not well.

03:18.610 --> 03:20.280
Made you feel it, did he?

03:23.740 --> 03:25.530
Well

03:25.830 --> 03:27.950
you needn't worry.

03:28.450 --> 03:30.120
The second is...

03:34.040 --> 03:35.920
Yes.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.800
Considerably.

07:32.320 --> 07:36.200
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

07:36.490 --> 07:38.950
You asked for the introduction.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.370
That's all my organization
will guarantee.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.460
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you

08:24.620 --> 08:26.960
that I have provided
reliable banking services

08:27.130 --> 08:29.840
for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

08:34.590 --> 08:36.929
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.760
No.

08:38.929 --> 08:41.600
I believe in
a reasonable rate of return.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.100
I want no risk in the portfolio.

08:44.270 --> 08:45.560
Agreed.

08:45.730 --> 08:47.560
And I can access it
anywhere in the world?

08:47.730 --> 08:48.940
Yes.

09:07.460 --> 09:10.130
I have the money,
so short another million shares

09:10.300 --> 09:12.000
<i>of Skyfleet stock.</i>

09:12.170 --> 09:16.090
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

09:16.260 --> 09:19.470
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.350
Just do it.

09:57.090 --> 09:59.590
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

10:02.140 --> 10:04.810
<i>I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.</i>

10:19.610 --> 10:21.030
He's on the move.

10:21.660 --> 10:24.160
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

10:24.950 --> 10:27.040
Stop touching your ear.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.330
- Sorry?
- Put your hand down.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.300
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.460
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct

20:12.620 --> 20:14.040
my dear general.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.290
Nothing sinister.

20:21.510 --> 20:22.920
All in.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.850
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance

20:29.020 --> 20:31.140
of making your straight.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.920
When does Ellipsis expire?

21:00.090 --> 21:03.300
- We have less than 36 hours. I can...
- No. No, no.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.220
That's all the time I have anyway.

21:07.930 --> 21:10.180
Give our guests
five minutes to leave

21:10.350 --> 21:12.680
or throw them overboard.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.990
Who the hell do they think they are?

21:26.160 --> 21:28.700
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough

21:28.870 --> 21:30.120
not to ask me what we do.

21:30.280 --> 21:34.000
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

21:34.160 --> 21:37.000
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.830
And how the hell
could Bond be so stupid?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.920
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

21:43.090 --> 21:45.470
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

21:45.630 --> 21:48.260
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing

21:48.430 --> 21:50.100
he'd have the good sense
to defect.

21:50.260 --> 21:52.140
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.430
You've got a bloody cheek.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.140
Sorry.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.140
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.970
Or yourself.

23:16.140 --> 23:18.220
You stormed into an embassy.

23:18.390 --> 23:20.980
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule

23:21.150 --> 23:22.770
of international relationships.

23:22.940 --> 23:24.860
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

23:25.020 --> 23:26.820
We wanted to question him,
not kill him.

23:28.190 --> 23:31.280
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.490
I did.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.660
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

23:35.830 --> 23:37.660
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.160
We're trying to find out

23:39.250 --> 23:41.790
how an entire network
of terrorist groups is financed

23:41.870 --> 23:43.420
and you give us one bomb-maker.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.840
Hardly the big picture,
wouldn't you say?

23:45.920 --> 23:49.260
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.340
And thanks to your trigger finger

23:51.430 --> 23:54.430
we have no idea
who hired him or why.

23:54.510 --> 23:56.850
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

23:56.930 --> 23:58.720
The same way
I found out your name.

23:58.810 --> 24:01.770
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for...

24:01.850 --> 24:04.850
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

24:05.900 --> 24:08.650
I knew it was too early
to promote you.

24:09.150 --> 24:13.200
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy

24:13.280 --> 24:15.530
so your mistake will be short-lived.

24:21.710 --> 24:26.750
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand

24:26.840 --> 24:30.210
but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.630
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

24:33.720 --> 24:35.720
Any thug can kill.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.300
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation

24:38.390 --> 24:40.970
and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

24:41.810 --> 24:44.940
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

24:46.230 --> 24:49.770
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

24:49.940 --> 24:52.110
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere

24:52.190 --> 24:53.650
and think about your future.

24:53.740 --> 24:56.700
Because these bastards
want your head.

24:56.870 --> 25:00.370
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.710
And Bond

25:13.090 --> 25:15.720
don't ever break into
my house again.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.600
Ma'am.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.130
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

26:39.090 --> 26:41.340
Hey. Hey.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.190
Hello.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.440
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

26:58.530 --> 27:01.030
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

27:44.410 --> 27:47.450
<i>Security to car park.
Security to car park.</i>

27:47.540 --> 27:49.250
Absolutely incredible.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.930
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

29:31.010 --> 29:34.600
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.100
Okay.

29:37.560 --> 29:40.980
- We have an ocean-view villa.
- Perfect.

29:43.990 --> 29:46.450
Could you do me a favour?
I was here last night

29:46.530 --> 29:50.410
and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

29:50.530 --> 29:52.950
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know...?

29:53.040 --> 29:55.500
- Mr. Dimitrios.
- Right.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.460
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

29:58.540 --> 30:00.290
Isn't the type
to take bad news well.

30:01.130 --> 30:04.130
But if I felt compelled to find him?

30:05.220 --> 30:07.380
He has a house just up the beach.

30:09.010 --> 30:10.340
Thank you.

31:11.410 --> 31:14.200
- What?
- He's in the Bahamas.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.830
You woke me
to share his holiday plans?

31:16.910 --> 31:19.040
Well, he's logged into
our secure website

31:19.120 --> 31:21.290
using your name and password.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.380
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

31:24.460 --> 31:26.920
<i>Well, I'm doing my best to find out.</i>

31:27.010 --> 31:30.930
- Who's he looking at?
<i>- Alex Dimitrios.</i>

31:31.300 --> 31:32.970
That slimy bugger.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.440
Now known associates.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.580
Le Chiffre.

32:14.970 --> 32:17.680
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.430
How can I assist you, sir?

32:20.520 --> 32:22.770
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.730
- Look what just happened.
- Good job, big boy.

32:25.810 --> 32:27.020
Yeah.

32:34.870 --> 32:35.910
Do you mind if I join?

32:35.990 --> 32:38.700
- Oh, good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.960
Small blind, big blind.

32:52.050 --> 32:53.760
I'm in.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.890
Bet's to you.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.310
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.150
Two hundred to you.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.360
Bet's to you.

33:13.450 --> 33:14.990
I heard you.

33:15.570 --> 33:17.410
Five to call.

33:20.870 --> 33:22.290
- Action's to you.
- Pair of sevens.

33:22.450 --> 33:23.870
Ace high.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.040
Check or bet.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.790
- Check.
- And to you.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.840
Five thousand.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.260
Five to call.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.440
- Check.
- Check to you, sir.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.440
All in.

33:54.110 --> 33:55.950
No, wait.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.030
Twenty thousand.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.530
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

34:03.040 --> 34:07.120
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

34:08.790 --> 34:10.750
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.880
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

34:24.060 --> 34:25.810
All right, show me, gentlemen.

34:30.810 --> 34:32.270
Three kings.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.280
There you go with my night.

34:40.370 --> 34:41.820
Trip aces.

34:41.909 --> 34:44.030
Aces win.

34:47.830 --> 34:49.170
Oh, and the valet ticket.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.000
Thank you.

34:55.090 --> 34:56.590
Sir.

35:28.710 --> 35:31.080
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

35:32.080 --> 35:35.290
No wonder he was
in such a foul mood.

35:36.510 --> 35:37.800
My mistake.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.220
Can I give you a lift home?

35:39.840 --> 35:43.300
That would really send him
over the edge.

35:43.390 --> 35:45.390
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.680
Well, perhaps you're just
out of practice.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.730
Perhaps.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.690
Well, what about
a drink at my place?

35:59.570 --> 36:01.900
Your place?

36:01.990 --> 36:04.870
- Is it close?
<i>- Very.</i>

36:11.250 --> 36:13.120
One drink.

36:38.440 --> 36:40.150
Good evening, sir,
and welcome back.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.150
Welcome to my home.

36:54.370 --> 36:57.500
<i>I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.</i>

36:57.590 --> 37:00.420
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

37:00.510 --> 37:05.050
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.310
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.100
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

37:12.270 --> 37:14.270
But I do care about my reputation.

37:15.190 --> 37:17.560
I have someone else
willing to do the job.

37:17.650 --> 37:19.480
He just needs the particulars

37:20.280 --> 37:22.070
and payment.

37:33.040 --> 37:36.750
You like married women,
don't you, James?

37:36.830 --> 37:39.080
It keeps things simple.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.920
What is it about bad men?

37:45.010 --> 37:48.090
You, my husband.

37:48.180 --> 37:50.930
I had so many chances
to be happy

37:51.010 --> 37:53.520
so many nice guys.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.440
Why can't nice guys
be more like you?

37:56.520 --> 37:58.770
Well, because then they'd be bad.

37:59.690 --> 38:01.980
Yes.

38:04.690 --> 38:07.530
But so much more interesting.

38:11.950 --> 38:14.500
What makes your husband
a bad man?

38:14.580 --> 38:17.290
His nature, I suppose.

38:17.370 --> 38:19.170
The nature of his work?

38:19.250 --> 38:22.920
A mystery, I'm afraid.

38:23.550 --> 38:28.970
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

38:29.050 --> 38:31.550
How afraid?

38:32.100 --> 38:34.930
Not enough to stop.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.690
Can I ask you a personal question?

38:46.320 --> 38:50.030
Now would seem
an appropriate time.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.570
Does "ellipsis"
mean anything to you?

39:01.920 --> 39:04.000
Should I ask him about it?

39:04.090 --> 39:06.420
Perhaps later.

39:07.380 --> 39:08.670
Yes, dear?

39:08.760 --> 39:10.760
<i>I'm on the last flight
tonight to Miami.</i>

39:10.840 --> 39:13.600
<i>Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.</i>

39:13.680 --> 39:16.140
Okay, I understand.

39:16.220 --> 39:19.020
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

39:20.520 --> 39:25.020
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami

39:25.110 --> 39:29.320
so you have all night
to question me.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.740
In that case

39:33.830 --> 39:35.030
we're gonna need

39:35.120 --> 39:37.540
some more champagne.

39:43.420 --> 39:44.920
<i>Good evening. Room Service.</i>

39:45.000 --> 39:48.920
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année

39:49.010 --> 39:50.380
and the beluga caviar?

39:50.470 --> 39:53.050
<i>- With everything?</i>
- Yes, with everything.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.350
<i>- And would that be for two, sir?</i>
- What?

39:55.430 --> 39:58.720
<i>- For two?</i>
- No, for one.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.550
Wait here.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.810
There you go. Number 53.

40:44.730 --> 40:47.230
<i>Dr. Von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors</i>

40:47.320 --> 40:50.280
<i>to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive</i>

40:50.360 --> 40:52.150
<i>nervous and vascular systems.</i>

41:52.630 --> 41:56.130
<i>Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?</i>

41:57.760 --> 42:01.050
<i>I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.</i>

42:01.220 --> 42:02.430
<i>This is edutainment.</i>

42:28.750 --> 42:30.960
<i>...fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses</i>

42:31.130 --> 42:35.010
<i>that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.</i>

42:49.150 --> 42:52.810
Hello.

43:02.450 --> 43:05.080
<i>Do not leave your vehicle
unattended.</i>

43:05.160 --> 43:07.830
<i>Welcome to Miami
International Airport.</i>

43:07.910 --> 43:11.080
<i>Kerbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted.</i>

44:46.050 --> 44:49.180
- Yes.
- It's Bond. I need her now.

44:49.270 --> 44:51.980
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

44:52.190 --> 44:55.600
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport

44:55.690 --> 44:58.270
because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

44:58.690 --> 45:01.400
- Sorry, can I put you on hold?
- I thought you might.

45:05.780 --> 45:08.580
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

45:11.370 --> 45:12.410
I'll call you back.

45:35.140 --> 45:37.560
- The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
- What about it?

45:37.650 --> 45:40.980
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

46:22.360 --> 46:23.400
Oh, my God!

46:23.610 --> 46:25.190
<i>Bond? Bond!</i>

46:28.200 --> 46:30.320
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

46:30.490 --> 46:32.450
<i>It's launching today.</i>

46:35.460 --> 46:36.660
I gotta go.

51:01.970 --> 51:03.720
Stop! Stop!

52:06.450 --> 52:08.370
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

53:41.460 --> 53:46.260
The put's expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

53:46.430 --> 53:51.850
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.570
Someone talked.

54:24.340 --> 54:26.380
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah, I have.

54:26.470 --> 54:28.550
I'm gonna get a few more photos.

54:42.900 --> 54:45.990
Quite the body count
you're stacking up.

54:46.740 --> 54:49.610
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband

54:49.700 --> 54:52.370
she must have been
the only one left to question.

54:52.950 --> 54:55.240
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

54:55.330 --> 54:56.410
No.

54:56.500 --> 55:00.080
- Not your name, what you were after?
- No.

55:00.170 --> 55:01.710
Dimitrios worked as middleman.

55:01.790 --> 55:03.710
Knew where to put his hands
on weapons

55:03.800 --> 55:05.340
and people who could use them.

55:05.420 --> 55:07.130
He worked with anyone
who had money.

55:07.220 --> 55:10.680
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre

55:10.760 --> 55:12.800
private banker
to the world's terrorists.

55:12.890 --> 55:16.470
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

55:16.560 --> 55:18.480
Oh, good. You're here.

55:18.560 --> 55:21.230
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

55:21.310 --> 55:25.900
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

55:55.140 --> 55:56.680
So you can keep an eye on me?

55:57.980 --> 55:59.520
Yes.

56:04.400 --> 56:07.650
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9/11

56:07.740 --> 56:11.070
the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

56:11.860 --> 56:15.120
When the stocks hit bottom on 9/12,
somebody made a fortune.

56:15.700 --> 56:18.200
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock

56:18.290 --> 56:19.870
or was supposed to.

56:19.960 --> 56:23.880
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

56:23.960 --> 56:28.000
Instead, somebody lost over
$100 million betting the wrong way.

56:28.960 --> 56:31.010
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

56:31.090 --> 56:33.720
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game

56:33.800 --> 56:36.050
at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

56:36.140 --> 56:40.310
Ten players, $10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

56:40.390 --> 56:43.270
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

56:43.350 --> 56:46.060
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

56:46.150 --> 56:48.230
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

56:48.320 --> 56:52.700
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

56:52.780 --> 56:56.280
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

56:56.370 --> 56:59.240
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

56:59.410 --> 57:00.950
We can't let him win this game.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.330
If he loses,
he'll have nowhere to run.

57:03.420 --> 57:06.290
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

57:06.460 --> 57:08.290
I'm putting you in the game

57:08.380 --> 57:11.170
replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

57:11.260 --> 57:15.130
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

57:15.220 --> 57:17.100
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

57:21.680 --> 57:26.150
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached

57:26.230 --> 57:29.440
but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

57:30.110 --> 57:31.980
No.

57:34.030 --> 57:35.700
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

57:36.870 --> 57:38.280
We'll know where you are.

57:38.370 --> 57:39.780
You can stop pretending.

57:40.620 --> 57:42.700
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

57:43.830 --> 57:46.170
Well, I knew you were you.

58:04.690 --> 58:06.390
Thank you.

58:13.400 --> 58:14.780
I'm the money.

58:17.070 --> 58:18.360
Every penny of it.

58:20.700 --> 58:23.330
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

58:24.200 --> 58:26.000
"Vesper."

58:26.080 --> 58:28.620
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

58:29.380 --> 58:30.920
Thank you.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.800
Your boss must be well-connected.

58:32.880 --> 58:35.340
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

58:35.920 --> 58:37.590
Or quite so stylishly.

58:39.640 --> 58:41.180
May I ask you where it is?

58:41.260 --> 58:43.930
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro

58:44.020 --> 58:48.480
with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

58:48.560 --> 58:51.690
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose

58:51.770 --> 58:54.730
our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

58:58.070 --> 58:59.490
What looks good?

59:06.710 --> 59:09.620
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

59:09.710 --> 59:11.710
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

59:11.880 --> 59:14.590
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

59:15.090 --> 59:17.010
So that would be
what you call "bluffing"?

59:20.050 --> 59:21.760
You've heard the term.

59:21.930 --> 59:24.680
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

59:24.770 --> 59:26.140
You play the man across from you.

59:26.310 --> 59:28.730
- And you're good at reading people?
- Yes, I am.

59:28.890 --> 59:30.690
Which is why
I've been able to detect

59:30.850 --> 59:32.980
an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

59:33.650 --> 59:36.530
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

59:37.570 --> 59:39.820
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

59:39.990 --> 59:41.570
So there is a plan?

59:41.660 --> 59:44.330
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars

59:44.450 --> 59:46.790
and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

59:46.870 --> 59:48.960
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

59:49.120 --> 59:51.420
About you, Miss Lynd?

59:51.500 --> 59:53.130
Well, your beauty's a problem.

59:53.540 --> 59:55.670
You worry you won't
be taken seriously.

59:55.750 --> 59:58.800
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.630
True, but this one
overcompensates

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.590
by wearing
slightly masculine clothing

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.220
being more aggressive
than her female colleagues

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.930
which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:11.390
and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.850
and promoted
by her male superiors

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.730
who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:21.360
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:24.660
but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:27.450
I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.370
All right.

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:35.880
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.460
and actually think
human beings dress like that.

01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:40.510
But you wear it with such disdain

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.510
my guess is
you didn't come from money

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:45.220
and your school friends
never let you forget it.

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:47.560
Which means you were
at that school by the grace

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.470
of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.310
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.440
that's what I'd say you are.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.400
Oh, you are.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.780
I like this poker thing.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.740
And that makes perfect sense

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:08.330
since MI6 looks
for maladjusted young men

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:10.490
that give little thought
to sacrificing others

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.250
in order to protect
Queen and country.

01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:14.500
You know

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:18.590
former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.420
- Rolex?
- Omega.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.470
Beautiful.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:25.720
Now, having just met you

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.640
I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.310
No, of course not.

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.140
But it wouldn't be a stretch
to imagine.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.440
You think of women
as disposable pleasures

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.650
rather than meaningful pursuits.

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:40.480
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:43.150
I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.240
and off your perfectly formed arse.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.280
You noticed?

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.530
Even accountants have imagination.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:50.950
How was your lamb?

01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:53.040
Skewered.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.790
One sympathizes.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.130
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:00.540
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:19.150
- Hotel Splendid, sir?
- That's right.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.650
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.960
It's just last-minute details.

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:43.380
Apparently we're very much in love.

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:47.090
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.260
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:53.430
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.220
and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest...

01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:57.520
- I am not.
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:59.770
Oh, no, I don't.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.810
We've been involved
for quite a while

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.400
hence the shared suite.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.940
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.910
so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:13.280
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.080
Religion and a securely locked door.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.120
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:21.000
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.460
Smart?

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.750
Single.

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:46.070
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:49.150
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.990
- Welcome, Mr. Bond.
- You sign that, dear.

01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:54.950
You represent the Treasury.

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:02.040
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.750
I will. Thank you.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.010
Very funny.

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:10.170
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.220
he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:14.890
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:17.350
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:19.980
but either way, that tells me
something about him.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.600
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.610
And now he knows
something about you.

01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:26.900
He knows you're reckless.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.490
Take the next one.

01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:32.450
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.530
Mr. Bond?

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.950
- It was left for you.
- Thank you.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.650
I love you too, M.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:54.030
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:59.160
Does he know
we've been watching him?

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.040
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:06.500
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.170
I'm afraid if you get
into trouble here

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:13.050
the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:16.380
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.350
and spent the time re-establishing
old relationships.

01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:23.970
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.060
That's him, with the moustache.

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.730
Over my left shoulder.

01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:31.110
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:33.280
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.110
He's not a very subtle man.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.490
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:42.790
couldn't afford
to outbid Le Chiffre.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.170
I hate to say it

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:56.260
but the accountants seem
to be running MI6 these days.

01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:00.590
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.970
Many of them are lovely people.

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:07.690
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy

01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:11.440
with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:15.940
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.320
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.370
Yes?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.710
For you.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.380
Something you expect me to wear?

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.220
I need you looking fabulous.

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.760
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.100
the players will be thinking
about your neckline

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.260
and not about their cards.

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.890
Do you think you can
do that for me?

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.940
I'll do my best.

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.940
Thank you.

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:06.160
I have a dinner jacket.

01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:09.790
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:11.170
This is the latter.

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:14.500
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.550
How...?

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.840
It's tailored.

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:21.590
I sized you up the moment we met.

01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:17.899
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:21.529
Thank you.

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:34.500
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:36.750
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.840
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.380
Well, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:54.890
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:57.600
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:59.770
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.

01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:03.070
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland

01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:04.440
holding the stakes.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.280
You have each deposited
$10 million buy-in.

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:12.450
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.790
The money will remain in escrow
until I return

01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:17.710
and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:21.000
into the encryptor, whereupon
the entire sum will be wired

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:23.260
to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.550
Mr. Bond?

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:27.220
We proceed alphabetically.

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.800
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:39.350
Six letters or more.

01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:55.120
High card for dealer position.

01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:03.550
It's Signor Gallardo.

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:06.670
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.300
and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$10,000.

01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:14.510
Well, enjoy the game.

01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:39.460
Four players.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.380
It's your bet.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.380
Check.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.760
Bet. Fifty thousand.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.240
Call.

01:12:12.490 --> 01:12:13.780
Fold.

01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:18.410
Fold. Heads up.

01:12:22.670 --> 01:12:24.130
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.220
Bet. One hundred thousand.

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:44.400
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.570
Was I? Forgive me.

01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:50.280
Good luck, darling.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:56.490
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

01:12:58.450 --> 01:12:59.750
<i>Monsieur Bond?</i>

01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:02.540
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:05.080
Call.

01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:11.470
Hello.

01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:15.260
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:18.600
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.720
Champagne.

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:25.270
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.660
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.830
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.670
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.670
Mr. Bond?

01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:58.890
Fold.

01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:08.610
Send the barman over, please.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.620
A dry martini. Wait.

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:21.540
Three measures Gordon's,
one of vodka

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:23.500
half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:26.620
- then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
- Yes, sir.

01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:29.580
- You know, I'll have one of those.
- So will I.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.800
Certainly.

01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:36.630
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:38.840
That's it?

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.810
Anyone want to play poker now?

01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:43.100
Someone's in a hurry.

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:54.070
Would you excuse me?

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.000
You taste nice.

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.130
- I thought we dispensed with covers.
- No.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:16.010
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:17.760
- Is he watching?
- Yes.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.010
Good.

01:15:19.090 --> 01:15:22.010
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.970
we won't be here past midnight.

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:27.060
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.270
Check.

01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:31.810
- You know, that's not half bad.
- Up to you.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:33.820
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.940
It was worth it to discover his tell.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.530
What do you mean?

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.990
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:46.330
- Bluffs? He had the best hand.
- Which he got on the last card.

01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:48.750
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:50.920
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.670
Winning was blind luck.

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:54.710
- Did you get the bug?
- Yes.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.760
Bet. One hundred thousand.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.420
Thank you.

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.720
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.890
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.140
Call.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.730
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:15.860
Ladies and gentlemen,
<i>Mesdames, Messieurs,</i>

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.860
we've now been
playing for four hours.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:22.450
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:57.020
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

01:16:58.610 --> 01:17:00.610
So?

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.950
You want to do what to me?

01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:04.450
You've lost me completely.

01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:07.530
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:35.100
So, what's so damn important?

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.150
I'm sorry.

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.570
Where is my money?

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.410
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:51.750
You're holding a parcel for me.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.080
Thank you.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:03.510
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:05.840
Your money is safe.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.390
Open that.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.450
You'll have it tomorrow.

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.700
All of it.

01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:47.130
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.430
Hold out your arm.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.480
Hold out your arm, my beauty

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.730
or I will take your head.

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:11.570
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.880
Stairs.

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.010
Not a word of protest.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.180
You should find a new boyfriend.

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:40.140
Go find Mathis.

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:43.560
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.730
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:52.170
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:56.300
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:57.720
A little.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.470
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:05.640
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:11.250
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:14.130
Here, let's see.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:31.560
That's better.

01:24:35.610 --> 01:24:37.070
You cold?

01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:38.650
Yeah.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.650
Here.

01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:39.920
You have any trouble
with the bodies?

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:42.170
Less than some.

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:59.690
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

01:26:00.570 --> 01:26:03.400
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:05.740
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:09.620
How's our girl?

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.370
Melted your cold heart yet?

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:32.560
Call.

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.180
Fold.

01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:36.270
And call.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.610
Three players.

01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:45.070
Three hundred grand.

01:26:45.150 --> 01:26:46.860
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.410
Call.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.120
And call.

01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:59.580
Three players.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.920
Check.

01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:11.600
<i>Monsieur Bond?</i>

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.900
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:39.960
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.130
My God, James was right.

01:27:43.170 --> 01:27:45.170
It's up to you.

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:53.680
Raise. One million.

01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:03.150
Seems someone knows
something I don't.

01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:05.440
Fold.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.440
Heads up, gentlemen.

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:09.110
It's up to you.

01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:24.750
Two.

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.630
Re-raise. Two million.

01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:31.680
And it's up to you.

01:28:42.730 --> 01:28:44.610
I'm all in.

01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:54.410
Well, it's 14 million
and 500,000.

01:28:54.490 --> 01:28:56.870
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:03.920
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.590
- Call.
- Call.

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:10.420
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:14.640
Full house. Kings and aces.

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.760
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

01:29:29.690 --> 01:29:33.450
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:40.620
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:42.460
Please.

01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:45.040
We will now break for one hour.

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:48.460
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:57.600
Good game.

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:29.040
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.960
I can't do that, James.

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.880
Look, I made a mistake.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:38.760
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:40.350
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:42.930
Sorry?

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:44.890
Try putting that in a sentence.

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:46.480
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.020
continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:52.270
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.900
That's what this is about.

01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:55.990
All you're going to do now
is lose more.

01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:57.780
Then you're an idiot.

01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:00.780
- I'm sorry?
- I said, you're a bloody idiot.

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:05.040
Look in my eyes.

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:07.540
I can beat this man, you know that.

01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:12.800
Get your hand off my arm.

01:31:35.650 --> 01:31:36.940
Vodka martini.

01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:39.860
- Shaken or stirred?
- Do I look like I give a damn?

01:31:58.010 --> 01:32:00.300
- James.
- Get the girl out.

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:08.640
Funny game, right?

01:32:08.730 --> 01:32:12.480
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:15.690
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:19.200
You should have a little faith.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:21.820
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:24.280
Had. Excuse me.

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:26.620
You're not buying in?

01:32:28.290 --> 01:32:29.710
No.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.050
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:39.880
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:43.090
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:48.100
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:51.810
And what about the winnings?

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.060
Does it look like
we need the money?

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.700
Shall we up the blinds?

01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:12.620
Why not?

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.590
Bet.

01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:21.340
Raise.

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:38.770
And fold.

01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:42.990
Excuse me, please.

01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.320
Call.

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.120
Raise.

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.710
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

01:33:55.170 --> 01:33:57.130
- Fold.
- Thank you.

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:05.720
Fold.

01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:12.810
Thank you.

01:34:12.930 --> 01:34:13.980
Wins.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.250
Deal me out.

01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:40.420
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:43.920
Small blind, please.

01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:50.450
- Who is it?
- It's 007.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.660
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:59.370
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:02.130
within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:03.500
I'm all ears.

01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:05.420
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:07.840
- Do we know what it is yet?
<i>- We're still scanning.</i>

01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:16.220
Attach the leads to your chest.

01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:26.860
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:30.030
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines

01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:31.860
<i>hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?</i>

01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:34.780
<i>- As soon as it reads charged...
- Lidocaine. That'll work.</i>

01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:37.450
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:39.120
His heart's gonna stop.

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:41.620
<i>There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.</i>

01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:46.550
Take the blue combi-pen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

01:36:46.630 --> 01:36:48.960
<i>That'll counteract the digitalis.</i>

01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:54.140
You're going to pass out
in a few seconds.

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:57.140
You need to keep your heart going.
Push the red button now, Bond.

01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:05.690
- Bond, push the damn button!
- Do it now!

01:37:53.530 --> 01:37:55.530
- You okay?
- Me?

01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:01.540
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:05.330
- Now get yourself off to a hospital.
- I will do.

01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:07.830
As soon as I've won this game.

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.670
You're not seriously
going back there?

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.010
I wouldn't dream of it.

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.390
Bet. One million.

01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:23.770
- All in.
- Call. All in.

01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:26.480
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.400
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.780
Queen plays. Wins.

01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:46.620
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:38:46.710 --> 01:38:49.330
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:54.460
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game

01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:56.380
which means no more buy-ins.

01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:59.720
The big blind is now
1 million dollars.

01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:07.940
Four players.

01:39:10.690 --> 01:39:12.110
It's your bet.

01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:17.400
<i>- Monsieur Bond?</i>
- Check.

01:39:17.490 --> 01:39:21.370
- Check.
- Twenty-four million in the pot already.

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.370
Check. And check.

01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:28.370
All check.

01:39:28.710 --> 01:39:29.920
Four players.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.340
- Check.
- Check.

01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:44.390
All in. Six million.

01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:47.850
Bet. Six million. All in.

01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:55.690
Five million. All in.

01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:58.400
Bet is 6 million.

01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:10.080
Raise.

01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:13.460
Twelve million. Heads up.

01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:47.200
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:51.460
Raise. All in.

01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:13.980
Well, I think I will call you
on that one.

01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:21.990
Call.

01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:38.170
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

01:41:38.250 --> 01:41:41.010
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:46.600
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:58.190
Full house. Eights full of aces.

01:42:16.290 --> 01:42:18.540
A higher full house.

01:42:18.630 --> 01:42:20.130
Aces full of sixes.

01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:27.340
<i>Monsieur Bond.</i>

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.990
Five and seven of spades.

01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:48.660
A straight flush.

01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.160
Four to the eight.

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.370
The high hand.

01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.580
Monsieur Bond wins.

01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:01.920
- For you.
- Thank you very much.

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:05.630
Congratulations.

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:09.260
- He's all yours.
- Much appreciated, brother.

01:43:16.230 --> 01:43:17.520
Congratulations.

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.600
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:22.230
You were almost dead an hour ago.

01:43:23.070 --> 01:43:26.110
Come on, I'm famished.

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.370
Thank you.

01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:49.970
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:53.310
They're going to extract him
before dawn.

01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:55.390
You know, I think
I'll call that a Vesper.

01:43:56.770 --> 01:43:58.690
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

01:43:58.770 --> 01:44:02.980
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

01:44:05.530 --> 01:44:08.650
- I thought that was quite a good line.
- It was a very good line.

01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:11.410
But you're laughing at it.

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:15.990
- Not so much it as you.
- Well, that's fine then.

01:44:22.290 --> 01:44:23.880
I figured out what that is.

01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:28.670
It's an Algerian love knot.

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:32.090
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:33.850
No, you didn't.

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:36.180
Someone gave that to you.

01:44:39.850 --> 01:44:41.650
He's a very lucky man.

01:44:48.110 --> 01:44:51.240
You can switch off so easily,
can't you?

01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.530
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:57.200
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.870
I don't believe you.

01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:03.210
You've got a choice, you know?

01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:05.040
Just because
you've done something

01:45:05.130 --> 01:45:07.380
doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:10.470
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:12.550
You think I can't take
my own advice?

01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:16.140
I think something is driving you.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:18.720
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:26.770
Mathis needs me.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:28.820
Good night.

01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:30.240
Congratulations again.

01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:51.380
Mathis.

01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:47.250
I'm afraid your friend Mathis
is really

01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.330
my friend Mathis.

01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:35.810
You've taken good care
of your body.

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:44.860
Such a waste.

01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:04.220
You know

01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:07.550
I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:09.930
It's the simplest thing

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:13.600
to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:16.350
And of course

01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:19.520
it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge

01:50:19.610 --> 01:50:22.320
that if you do not yield
soon enough

01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:26.660
there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

01:50:32.710 --> 01:50:34.620
The only question remains

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.290
will you yield in time?

01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:43.510
I want the money.

01:51:02.190 --> 01:51:05.740
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:08.240
So all I need from you
is the password.

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:21.250
The password, please.

01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.840
I've got a little itch

01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:29.840
down there.

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.100
Would you mind?

01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:43.230
No! No! No!

01:51:44.150 --> 01:51:47.990
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:50.530
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

01:51:52.450 --> 01:51:53.950
Yeah!

01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:58.500
Yes, yes, yes.

01:52:04.130 --> 01:52:09.630
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:13.010
I died?

01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:14.470
- I died?
- Yes.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:17.770
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

01:52:17.850 --> 01:52:19.640
Which means your clients
will hunt you down

01:52:19.730 --> 01:52:22.730
and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.320
Because if you kill me

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:26.480
there'll be nowhere else to hide.

01:52:26.690 --> 01:52:29.610
But you are so wrong!

01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:32.820
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend

01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:35.740
your people would still welcome me
with open arms

01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:40.920
because they need what I know.

01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:44.210
The big picture.

01:52:52.090 --> 01:52:54.430
Give me the password

01:52:54.510 --> 01:52:56.510
and I will at least let her live.

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:03.270
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

01:53:16.330 --> 01:53:18.490
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:20.410
No.

01:53:22.290 --> 01:53:24.210
So I think

01:53:28.710 --> 01:53:32.220
I'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:47.610
I'll get the money.

01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:51.110
Tell them I'll get the money.

01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:55.700
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:23.560
Francesco.

01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:42.160
Vesper.

01:54:44.290 --> 01:54:45.830
No.

01:54:46.630 --> 01:54:48.040
Not him.

01:54:48.130 --> 01:54:50.090
Not Mathis.

01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.090
No.

01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:55.970
I'll get the doctor.

01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:00.510
Not him.

01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:03.600
Any ideas?

01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:11.150
- What?
- Why they left the two of you alive.

01:55:13.150 --> 01:55:14.610
Where is she?

01:55:15.610 --> 01:55:17.530
Sleeping.

01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:21.410
And I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:24.250
It's just odd

01:55:24.330 --> 01:55:28.370
killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:31.840
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:35.130
Get a look at the killer?

01:55:35.630 --> 01:55:37.380
No.

01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:40.300
Shame.

01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:43.680
Drink up.

01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:49.350
Anything else you remember?

01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:51.610
Anything that can help us?

01:55:51.690 --> 01:55:53.360
Help us?

01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:55.690
Or help you?

01:56:36.110 --> 01:56:39.360
Hello.

01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:42.870
You all right?

01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:45.240
I can't resist waking you.

01:56:45.330 --> 01:56:50.000
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:53.130
It makes me feel reborn.

01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:59.970
If you'd just been born

01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:02.930
wouldn't you be naked?

01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:05.890
You have me there.

01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:11.270
You can have me anywhere.

01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:14.940
I can?

01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:18.940
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:22.910
Does this mean
that you're warming to me?

01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:25.280
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:26.950
It's just that not so long ago

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.960
I would have described
your feelings towards me as...

01:57:32.370 --> 01:57:35.040
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

01:57:35.590 --> 01:57:38.920
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

01:57:39.010 --> 01:57:41.550
That is something to be afraid of.

01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:47.970
- Hello.
- Oh, perfect timing.

01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:52.230
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:54.400
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush

01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:56.610
but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

01:57:56.690 --> 01:57:59.650
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:01.900
I'm afraid not.

01:58:03.070 --> 01:58:05.990
If you would type in
the account number.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.420
And now the password.

01:58:15.210 --> 01:58:16.420
You can do that.

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:19.170
I would if I knew what it was.

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:26.180
V-E-S-P-E-R.

01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:38.900
The funds have been transferred.

01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:41.860
Sorry for disturbing you.

01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:46.950
<i>- Auf Wiedersehen.</i>
- Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:54.910
You know, James

01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:00.500
I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you

01:59:00.590 --> 01:59:04.010
was your smile
and your little finger

01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:06.880
you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

01:59:16.230 --> 01:59:19.940
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:26.700
- I have no idea.
- But you're aching to find out.

01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:33.910
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:36.830
You've got your Armour back on.

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:38.210
That's that.

01:59:39.670 --> 01:59:42.250
I have no Armour left.

01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:46.010
You've stripped it from me.

01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:49.680
Whatever is left of me.

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:52.680
Whatever is left of me

01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:55.560
whatever I am

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:58.190
I'm yours.

02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:02.630
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:05.290
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:06.670
Mathis?

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:08.920
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

02:01:09.010 --> 02:01:11.470
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

02:01:12.010 --> 02:01:13.680
That's how he wiped me out.

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:17.560
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:19.930
I can't believe it.

02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:21.690
No, neither could I.

02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:24.520
I thought he had my back.

02:01:25.190 --> 02:01:27.020
But there you go, lesson learned.

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.820
Does everyone have a tell?

02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:34.490
Yes.

02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:39.450
Everyone.

02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:41.410
Everyone except you.

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:47.920
I wonder if that's why I love you.

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.300
You love me?

02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:54.550
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you

02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:57.640
until one of us
has to find an honest job.

02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:01.810
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

02:02:02.690 --> 02:02:04.140
You're serious.

02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:07.480
Like you said

02:02:07.570 --> 02:02:09.360
you do what I do for too long

02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:12.360
and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

02:02:12.450 --> 02:02:15.360
I'm leaving with
what little I have left.

02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:19.450
Is that enough for you?

02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:05.680
- Come on.
- No. No.

02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:09.480
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:11.810
What's the time?

02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:16.110
How much do we need
to float for a month?

02:04:16.530 --> 02:04:18.360
I've got plenty.

02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:22.410
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

02:04:25.370 --> 02:04:27.830
You stopped wearing the necklace.

02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:31.210
Yeah. It was time.

02:04:31.290 --> 02:04:34.040
Time enough to get over someone?

02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:42.180
To realise sometimes
you can forget the past.

02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:52.810
Though apparently not
your employer.

02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.490
Back in one month.

02:05:01.530 --> 02:05:04.030
Come on. I'll get the money

02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:06.330
you get supplies.

02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:38.440
I'll see you back here
in half an hour.

02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:05.430
- Hello, M.
- I got your note.

02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:07.300
Yes?

02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:09.260
We'll talk about that later.

02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:12.520
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here

02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:15.230
wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:21.860
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:25.360
<i>Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.</i>

02:06:25.450 --> 02:06:27.660
So you'll be depositing it today.

02:06:27.950 --> 02:06:30.620
On my way to the bank right now.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.710
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

02:06:34.170 --> 02:06:35.420
<i>Hello.</i>

02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:38.960
Mr. Mendel? I'm having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.

02:06:39.090 --> 02:06:40.920
It was transferred
to the account number

02:06:41.010 --> 02:06:43.340
your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

02:06:46.090 --> 02:06:49.510
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:54.140
- Where?
- The Venice branch, of course.

02:06:54.230 --> 02:06:55.520
St. Mark's Square.

02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:59.190
<i>Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?</i>

02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:13.450
I'll kill her!

02:09:14.410 --> 02:09:15.660
Allow me.

02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:37.550
I'm sorry, James.

02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:52.030
<i>She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.</i>

02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:54.200
<i>They were very much in love.</i>

02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:57.830
<i>He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.</i>

02:16:57.910 --> 02:17:02.959
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:04.540
We should've picked up on it

02:17:04.629 --> 02:17:07.010
but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies

02:17:07.090 --> 02:17:08.629
we forget to watch our friends.

02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:12.389
<i>How are you doing?</i>

02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:14.799
She left her cell phone.

02:17:14.889 --> 02:17:17.309
She must have known I'd check it.

02:17:18.059 --> 02:17:20.270
She knew you were you.

02:17:21.309 --> 02:17:23.650
- Well, at least this clears Mathis.
<i>- No.</i>

02:17:23.730 --> 02:17:25.480
- No?
- No.

02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:28.110
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:30.570
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

02:17:31.410 --> 02:17:33.280
You don't trust anyone,
do you, James?

02:17:33.370 --> 02:17:35.030
<i>No.</i>

02:17:35.490 --> 02:17:37.830
Then you've learnt your lesson.

02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:40.830
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:42.709
Will do.

02:17:44.959 --> 02:17:46.420
If you do need time.

02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:47.840
<i>Why should I need more time?</i>

02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:52.219
The job's done,
and the bitch is dead.

02:17:53.139 --> 02:17:54.969
James

02:17:55.549 --> 02:17:59.020
did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

02:17:59.559 --> 02:18:01.389
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:05.559
<i>She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.</i>

02:18:05.650 --> 02:18:07.860
<i>I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.</i>

02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:12.400
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

02:18:13.490 --> 02:18:16.530
<i>And now we'll never know
who was behind this.</i>

02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:19.200
<i>The trail's gone cold.</i>

02:19:46.670 --> 02:19:48.710
- Hello.
<i>- Mr. White?</i>

02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:50.420
<i>We need to talk.</i>

02:19:50.500 --> 02:19:52.420
Who is this?

02:20:22.660 --> 02:20:24.790
The name's Bond.

02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:26.830
James Bond.
