WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.128
<i>We can get the hell out of here right now</i>

00:03.128 --> 00:05.339
<i>and find out what really happened
with your dad.</i>

00:07.591 --> 00:10.427
<i>Now, you got just about 60 seconds
to make up your minds.</i>

00:14.890 --> 00:16.099
What's it gonna be?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.060
- Wait a minute.
- We don't have a minute.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.895
That van in the parking lot?

00:20.687 --> 00:21.688
Thought so.

00:23.607 --> 00:24.983
I'm not going anywhere with you.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.652
Hey, you came to me.

00:27.653 --> 00:28.654
If you don't want to find out

00:28.654 --> 00:30.906
if your own father's alive or dead,
that's your business.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.366
But I do want to find out.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.827
If he's alive, how do we find him?
Where do we even start looking?

00:35.827 --> 00:37.496
We start where his trail ended.

00:37.996 --> 00:38.997
Good luck with that.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.541
They searched for his plane for weeks.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.961
That's hundreds of square miles of,
you know, Alaska.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.921
Yeah, then we'll look where they didn't.

00:47.089 --> 00:52.344
Now, this is a <i>niwaki,</i> which means
an entirely different pruning process.

00:52.928 --> 00:55.472
So, of course, it's quite fascinating.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.977
Look, all I want
is for these Monarch asshats

00:59.977 --> 01:03.146
to leave me out of whatever crazy shit
my dad was into.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.357
You good with that?

01:06.275 --> 01:08.193
- I wanna find my father.
- Me too.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.285
Why do you wanna find him?

01:16.285 --> 01:17.786
What's your dog in the hunt?

01:17.786 --> 01:20.455
Hiroshi Randa's more like a son to me
than a nephew.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.125
He's the only family I ever had.
That's my dog.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.421
This is crazy.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.549
Crazier than finding secret files
in your dad's secret safe?

01:31.550 --> 01:32.926
Crazier than a secret brother?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.428
A secret family?

01:34.428 --> 01:36.471
They're onto us. Get to the van.

01:36.471 --> 01:37.681
EMERGENCY OCCURRENCE

01:37.681 --> 01:38.599
PLEASE STAY ALERT

01:38.599 --> 01:40.851
- I'll drive. Give the keys.
- No, this is a rental.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.395
- I don't think you're allowed.
- God, you are your father's son. Come on.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.813
EMERGENCY OCCURRENCE

01:44.813 --> 01:46.565
PLEASE STAY ALERT

01:51.653 --> 01:53.322
- Okay, where's the key go?
- Oh, my God.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.740
When was the last time you drove?

01:54.740 --> 01:56.617
If it floats, flies,
or runs on four wheels, I can handle it.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.202
Foot on the pedal. Press the button.

01:58.202 --> 01:59.745
- Button?
- Yes!

02:00.579 --> 02:02.164
Hooah!

02:02.164 --> 02:03.248
It's Lee Shaw!

02:06.126 --> 02:07.920
They're headed to the south gate!

02:08.211 --> 02:09.295
<i>Close the south gate!</i>

02:13.509 --> 02:15.010
Stop!

02:15.511 --> 02:16.929
Watch out!

02:20.432 --> 02:21.517
You pay for collision?

02:21.517 --> 02:22.684
Yeah.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.230
What are you doing? Where are we go--

02:36.782 --> 02:38.075
Watch out!

02:43.288 --> 02:44.289
Are you insane?

02:44.289 --> 02:46.291
You never drove with your grandmother.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.584
Hang on.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.425
He's coming back! Main entrance!

02:59.888 --> 03:01.390
Oh, my God!

03:26.582 --> 03:27.666
I don't like it.

03:27.666 --> 03:31.336
Yeah, well, you haven't exactly
kept that opinion a state secret, Billy.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.590
We've always maintained our independence.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.092
Because no one takes us seriously.

03:39.303 --> 03:40.679
Look, if you two wanna keep this

03:40.679 --> 03:43.599
our private little monster-hunting club,
then fine. We pull the request.

03:43.599 --> 03:46.185
But if you wanna make a difference,

03:47.477 --> 03:49.688
you wanna do some serious science,

03:49.688 --> 03:50.939
then we need backing.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.027
Can we trust this guy?

03:55.027 --> 03:57.154
As long as we don't make him
look like a jackass.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.408
Okay.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.535
- Okay.
- Yeah.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.539
Welcome to Monarch, General.

04:11.335 --> 04:14.713
Who'd have thought you'd parlay
escort duty into your first command?

04:15.672 --> 04:18.341
And these eggheads are already
starting to grow on you, Shaw.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.053
It's a bit like herding cats, sir,

04:21.053 --> 04:23.889
if cats had Geiger counters
and thought they were smarter than you.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.769
My colleagues: Dr. Miura, William Randa.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.648
Congratulations on your promotion, General.

04:32.648 --> 04:35.776
- Well, thank you, miss.
- Of course. And it's Doctor.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.445
Forgive me.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.201
I believe you have something to show us,
Doctor?

04:57.339 --> 04:59.049
What the hell?

05:00.050 --> 05:01.593
Tell me this is some kind of fossil.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.971
That would be a reasonable guess,

05:03.971 --> 05:07.474
but we took this impression
in a muddy field in Indonesia.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.518
Three weeks ago,
before the monsoons filled it in.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.354
How does something this big
walk around without being seen?

05:12.354 --> 05:13.730
Well, I'm leaning towards teleporta--

05:13.730 --> 05:16.108
We have a number of working theories, sir.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.073
This is gonna give me nightmares.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.954
But until you show us what made this,
a footprint's just a hole in the sand.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.831
You couldn't at least get me a photograph?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.249
Why just settle for a photograph?

05:32.916 --> 05:35.294
What if we had a way
to lure it out of hiding?

05:35.294 --> 05:37.171
All we need is 150 pounds of uranium.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.505
And let me explain that, sir.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.215
That's as much as we dropped on Japan.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.429
What are you playing at here?

05:47.806 --> 05:50.475
General, while I was
researching my doctorate,

05:50.475 --> 05:53.520
I discovered anomalous
radiation trails in the troposphere.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.106
And we think that
they may be directly correlated

05:56.106 --> 05:57.774
with the Titan's movements.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.193
You think they're radioactive?

05:59.193 --> 06:03.947
It's less that they emit radiation
than they absorb it, feed on it.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.491
I believe that we need to
seize the initiative on this, sir.

06:06.491 --> 06:09.912
Facing them over there
is far better than facing them over here.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.123
- Isn't that what Ike would say?
- President Eisenhower,

06:13.123 --> 06:14.208
our commander in chief,

06:14.208 --> 06:17.169
would say we need every last ounce
of uranium for national security.

06:17.169 --> 06:21.924
With all due respect, sir,
a creature like this,

06:22.549 --> 06:23.675
as big as this,

06:23.675 --> 06:26.678
is an existential threat
to global security.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.286
Yes. Yes! We got it.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.871
Do you have any idea how huge this is?

06:52.871 --> 06:55.040
150 pounds, I'd say.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.544
Maybe next time,
don't lead with teleportation.

06:58.544 --> 06:59.628
It's a theory.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.463
Yeah, and so is the flat Earth,

07:01.463 --> 07:03.674
but it's not gonna get you
funding from the Pentagon.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.718
We're talking about upending
centuries of accepted science

07:06.718 --> 07:10.264
in evolution, zoology, physics.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.558
You know, it requires open minds.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.518
Yeah, and open eyes, Billy.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.061
You gotta read the room.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.773
This is a voyage of discovery.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.859
So I'm not gonna bite my tongue
just to get support

07:21.859 --> 07:23.443
from a bunch of gun-toting Neanderthals.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.700
We got a lot of work to do.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.201
Okay?

07:31.702 --> 07:32.995
I'll see you guys in the office.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.544
You know how he is.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.296
I do.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.427
If it wasn't for you,
neither of us would be here.

07:48.427 --> 07:51.305
And that is not a theory, that's a fact.

07:52.890 --> 07:57.686
So, you are saying that there is a place
for gun-toting Neanderthals?

07:58.896 --> 07:59.938
Thank you.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.693
He is right, though.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.821
If we hide who we are
and what we're trying to do,

08:07.821 --> 08:09.865
then what's the point of doing it at all?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.798
We started out with pencil and paper.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.009
Not much of a leap forward.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.262
I don't know how
Billy kept these journals.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.140
He'd scribble down
every crazy thing he came across

09:58.140 --> 10:00.350
till his pencils were nothing but nubs.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.643
- Dad did that.
- Yeah?

10:01.643 --> 10:04.021
He'd sharpen them
with the penknife that he carried.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.939
Left the shavings everywhere.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.443
Mom got tired of sweeping up after him.

10:10.194 --> 10:13.739
Now, there's something in here
Hiroshi didn't want Monarch to know about.

10:13.739 --> 10:17.743
And my gut says if we find it
before they do, we find him.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.495
May built something to read them,
but it's back at her place.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.164
Great.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.417
Well, no, I actually--
I digitized them already.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.087
You know, save it for a rainy day.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.964
Well, all right, egghead.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.926
Need you to look in there
for anything about Alaska.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.762
Okay. Well, mining rudimentary visual data
for key words

10:36.762 --> 10:38.889
isn't exactly a walk in the park.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.057
Can't just google it.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.312
Do you know what Google is?

10:45.312 --> 10:48.899
Well, I wasn't
in solitary confinement, May.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.319
When was Monarch founded?

10:53.403 --> 10:55.197
Late '40s, thereabouts.

10:57.241 --> 10:59.743
Wouldn't that make you,
like, 90 years old?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.705
What can I say? Good genes, huh?

11:06.124 --> 11:07.125
Wow.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.420
What is all this anyway?

11:10.420 --> 11:11.755
Hopes.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.925
Dreams. Ambitions.

11:15.551 --> 11:18.512
It's what we wanted Monarch to be
before they lost their way.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.390
And look at 'em now. They're chasing
you guys instead of monsters.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.687
Did our dad really work for them?
For Monarch?

11:28.730 --> 11:30.482
It is your family business.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.776
He knew these things existed.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.571
You all knew.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.074
You could've warned people,
tried to stop it.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.326
Hey, that's exactly
what we were trying to do.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.954
But you were there. You saw it.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.957
You really think anything on earth
could've stopped it?

11:46.957 --> 11:48.250
Stopped that?

11:48.876 --> 11:50.502
Then he threw his life away for nothing.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.964
It's not our family business...

11:55.966 --> 11:57.551
it's the family curse.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.148
You packed the large-format camera?

12:53.148 --> 12:54.358
- Yes, Billy.
- All right.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.401
- And the long lenses? The 500-millimeters?
- Oh, no.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.987
I left it behind with the seismometer
and all the extra film.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.823
That's too bad. So much
for the cover of <i>National Geographic</i>.

13:05.744 --> 13:06.995
What the hell?

13:12.668 --> 13:15.504
I told you we couldn't trust that bastard.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.548
Hey, hold on. Let me handle this.

13:17.548 --> 13:19.716
Let me just-- Let me handle this.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.309
General.

13:34.606 --> 13:35.691
General.

13:41.154 --> 13:45.534
Sir, this appears to be going
in a direction we didn't discuss.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.703
We discussed you needing
a large quantity of uranium.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.162
Not in bomb form, sir.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.747
Should've been more specific.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.500
You could've told us.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.128
Well, that's not how
top-secret nuclear tests work, son.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.212
I understand, sir.

13:57.212 --> 14:00.299
All they're asking for is a chance
to assess what we're dealing with.

14:00.299 --> 14:01.842
We don't even know what these things are--

14:01.842 --> 14:04.845
They're an existential threat
to global security.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.764
Isn't that right?

14:07.764 --> 14:08.849
Yes, sir.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.934
How many stars do you see there?

14:10.934 --> 14:12.102
One, sir.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.730
Which I understand means
you had to go through two or three--

14:15.314 --> 14:17.900
four different levels
to get what we asked for.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.610
And the judgment of all those stars

14:19.610 --> 14:22.529
was that if we can lure this thing
out into the open, we deal with it here.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.614
Now.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.991
Now, monster or no monster, that thing,

14:26.491 --> 14:28.952
that's not going back to Los Alamos
in a crate.

14:35.501 --> 14:39.755
I realize that
this is not what they had in mind,

14:39.755 --> 14:42.966
but it's become bigger than all of us.

14:44.343 --> 14:47.596
You asked for the support
of the United States Army.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.766
This is it.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.658
Hey, it's me.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.701
Sorry, it's windy.

15:09.701 --> 15:13.038
I'm on a boat, on a ship.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.999
You know I can't tell you that.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.377
Hey, listen, I--

15:19.753 --> 15:21.713
Hey, can you just listen for a second?

15:23.966 --> 15:25.884
Look, I might be coming back soon.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.303
No, I mean it. For real.

15:30.556 --> 15:32.224
If I knew more, I would tell you.

15:37.563 --> 15:39.398
Hey, I gotta go. Yeah, time's up.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.028
That's bad for the environment.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.448
The fish eat the plastic,
and we eat the fish.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.535
I'll make a donation to Greenpeace.

15:53.245 --> 15:56.123
Or you can tell me why
you're ditching your phone in the ocean.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.210
Do you need something?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.462
He wants to go over the game plan.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.427
You really trust that old bastard?

16:08.427 --> 16:11.054
You don't need to stick your neck out
for us any longer,

16:11.054 --> 16:12.556
not if you need to get back.

16:12.556 --> 16:13.932
This is my fault.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.601
- This is my mess.
- Yeah.

16:15.601 --> 16:18.604
Yeah, it is your mess. And hers.
And you dragged me into it.

16:18.604 --> 16:21.315
You cost me my business and my home,

16:21.315 --> 16:23.984
my life, everything I've built, who I am.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.821
- I didn't know this would happen.
- Yeah, fair enough.

16:29.615 --> 16:33.285
But until we sort out your mess
and I get back what you cost me,

16:34.453 --> 16:37.039
you do not get to tell me what I need.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.926
Okay, I greased the wheels
as best I could.

16:49.593 --> 16:50.802
But here's the thing, guys.

16:51.303 --> 16:54.431
We get one eager-beaver border guard
who finds these on us,

16:54.431 --> 16:55.807
and it's game over immediately.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.851
So we need to get rid of these.

17:01.563 --> 17:02.856
No.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.108
You told us the key
to finding my father is in there.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.527
She's got a copy on her laptop.

17:06.527 --> 17:08.069
- They're not holy reli--
- I don't care.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.821
Why do I have to do everything you say?

17:11.698 --> 17:12.866
And why are we going to Korea?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.201
My father disappeared in Alaska.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.618
Alaska is that way!

17:16.537 --> 17:19.705
- Do you have any idea what you're doing?
- Well, I got us out of Japan, didn't I?

17:19.705 --> 17:22.291
Onto this ship, no passport,
no Monarch in sight.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.463
Now, there's someone in Pohang we need.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.964
He's an old friend of mine.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.260
He might be the last friend I have left.

17:31.844 --> 17:32.761
But you're right.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.763
Hiroshi is your dad.

17:35.556 --> 17:36.849
And yours.

17:36.849 --> 17:39.142
Now, you two wanna start
calling the shots, you got every right.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.686
So, once we get there...

17:42.688 --> 17:43.814
where to?

18:22.728 --> 18:24.980
- Okay, where's your friend?
- Just trust me, okay?

18:30.986 --> 18:33.197
Wait a minute. We're supposed to be
in line number two. Come on.

18:42.956 --> 18:43.957
We're good.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.546
I think we're supposed to be
in line number two.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.258
Shit.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.179
- Passport.
- Sorry?

18:57.179 --> 18:58.263
Passport!

18:58.764 --> 19:00.307
You speak English?

19:00.307 --> 19:01.642
English?

19:02.392 --> 19:04.144
Here's the situation.

19:04.645 --> 19:08.357
I got my sister's
adopted grandkids with me, right?

19:08.357 --> 19:09.566
So we're on that ship.

19:09.566 --> 19:13.195
And I told 'em, for safekeeping,
we gotta put everything in one backpack.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.363
Backpack, right?

19:14.363 --> 19:16.782
So, anyway, look, we're not terrorists,

19:16.782 --> 19:19.368
and I've never been to North Korea, so--

19:19.368 --> 19:22.454
- Hey! Hold on. Hey!
- Oh, my God. Please, please!

19:22.454 --> 19:24.706
I have my passport. I have my passport.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.917
Couldn't you just let me
contact the American embassy--

19:34.091 --> 19:35.843
No. What,
it's gonna get fined or something?

19:35.843 --> 19:38.178
I'd be-- 'Cause I'd be more than happy
to pay you guys,

19:38.178 --> 19:40.722
- so you can do whatever you want with it.
- What's going on?

19:40.722 --> 19:42.349
- What do you got to lose?
- My job.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.268
- We can't go to prison.
- Shaw screwed us.

19:44.268 --> 19:45.394
You run the show, don't you?

19:45.394 --> 19:48.230
I just want you to know something.
I will make it worth your while!

19:48.230 --> 19:49.606
We are not for sale.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.316
Well, then you're
even dumber than you look.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.652
- I mean, you--
- Shit.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.195
I told you

19:55.195 --> 19:57.698
you would meet some really stupid people.

19:57.698 --> 19:58.866
I know.

20:01.326 --> 20:04.079
Jesus, man.
Ever heard of pulling your punches?

20:04.079 --> 20:06.790
No. My brother!

20:06.790 --> 20:08.584
It's been too long, Du-Ho.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.211
You look younger every time.
You look good.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.297
Not really.
But that's what everybody tells me.

20:13.297 --> 20:15.090
Hey, we gotta get going
before somebody finds him.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.050
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

20:17.050 --> 20:19.469
O, ye of little faith. Come on.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.013
Asshole.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.087
Welcome to Japan, ma'am.

20:54.671 --> 20:57.591
Thank you, Tim. I appreciate
any opportunity to visit Japan.

20:57.591 --> 20:58.926
Although I was supposed to be

20:58.926 --> 21:01.220
moving my daughter into her college dorm
this weekend.

21:01.220 --> 21:02.304
Congratulations.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.556
But now my ex-husband is celebrating
this milestone with her

21:04.556 --> 21:07.267
because Lee Shaw has decided to
no longer avail himself

21:07.267 --> 21:09.019
of his generous retirement package.

21:09.019 --> 21:11.146
- Ma'am, if I may, I--
- No, you may not.

21:13.482 --> 21:15.150
What did he tell you?

21:16.693 --> 21:19.780
Some valuable data had been stolen.
We needed to retrieve it.

21:19.780 --> 21:22.783
And did he mention that he had
no authorization to run

21:22.783 --> 21:24.535
this rogue escapade of his?

21:28.830 --> 21:30.457
I assumed...

21:32.251 --> 21:35.087
That plane is being refueled
and will be ready to leave in 30 minutes.

21:35.087 --> 21:36.171
You'll both be on it.

21:36.171 --> 21:38.549
We can't leave.
They have Bill Randa's files.

21:38.549 --> 21:39.633
Sixty-year-old field notes

21:39.633 --> 21:42.094
and crackpot theories
are not gonna help us avert another G-Day.

21:42.094 --> 21:44.596
Yeah, well,
Lee Shaw seems to think otherwise.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.605
If you really believed
they were so important,

21:53.605 --> 21:56.859
why not bring it to Dr. Serizawa or to me?

21:56.859 --> 21:58.235
Why do it alone?

22:00.988 --> 22:05.409
Is this about our mission or yours?

22:05.409 --> 22:06.493
This is confirmed?

22:06.827 --> 22:07.828
All of them?

22:11.748 --> 22:12.916
All right, stand by.

22:14.459 --> 22:16.253
Shaw is in South Korea.

22:16.253 --> 22:18.213
Facial recognition AI flagged him
and the others

22:18.213 --> 22:20.549
detained by customs at the port in Pohang.

22:20.549 --> 22:22.759
Somehow, he managed to slip away though.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.933
You, on that plane in 30.

22:29.933 --> 22:32.019
You, get a tactical team
and get on Shaw's ass.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.103
Whatever you need.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.316
I need my partner.

22:40.319 --> 22:41.612
What if he's right?

22:43.238 --> 22:45.574
Shaw's been on ice for years.
Why make his move now?

22:46.325 --> 22:49.953
If I move quickly, I might be able to
get the jump on Shaw, but not without him.

22:49.953 --> 22:52.497
No one understands better
what Shaw might be up to,

22:52.497 --> 22:54.583
why these files are so important to him.

22:56.210 --> 22:57.377
Crazy knows crazy.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.635
Hey, Du-Ho.
Did you get the gear I asked for?

23:04.635 --> 23:06.053
Yeah. It's already on board.

23:12.768 --> 23:14.102
Bamboo Bomber?

23:14.645 --> 23:18.857
I said a jet, Du-Ho,
not an aluminum coffin with wings.

23:19.650 --> 23:21.693
Everything that could go wrong with her,

23:21.693 --> 23:23.153
- already has.
- Yeah.

23:23.153 --> 23:26.949
All right.
Air Du-Ho, ready for immediate boarding!

23:27.616 --> 23:30.285
We're going all the way to Alaska in that?

23:30.994 --> 23:32.246
Don't think of it as old.

23:32.746 --> 23:33.872
Think of it as vintage.

24:03.193 --> 24:06.280
Still nothing on sonar, General.
How long do you plan on holding?

24:14.121 --> 24:16.331
It's hot enough to
fry the egg on Puckett's face.

24:16.331 --> 24:17.875
If this thing's a no-show,

24:17.875 --> 24:20.711
I think it's safe to say
we're losing the Army's backing.

24:22.296 --> 24:26.258
It's better than watching them obliterate
something they don't even understand.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.570
- What's that reading?
- What happened?

24:46.570 --> 24:48.655
I don't know, sir. It shorted out.

24:50.574 --> 24:52.951
Give me an update. What's going on?

24:56.330 --> 24:58.832
Attention! Attention! Sonar contact.

25:16.517 --> 25:17.809
Is that a dinosaur?

25:18.352 --> 25:19.478
Is that armor?

25:20.771 --> 25:23.398
What the hell
does that thing need protection from?

25:25.108 --> 25:26.109
Us.

25:32.366 --> 25:33.992
Well, I'll be damned.

25:33.992 --> 25:36.411
Look at that thing haul ass.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.748
How have we never seen this thing before?

25:40.374 --> 25:43.168
If they go through with this,
how will we ever know?

25:45.212 --> 25:46.213
This is wrong.

25:53.470 --> 25:54.471
General?

25:56.181 --> 25:58.600
General, I think we should
consider standing down, sir.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.104
If we can't learn everything we can
about the enemy--

26:02.104 --> 26:03.897
You wait to see
what the enemy is gonna do,

26:03.897 --> 26:05.399
you've already lost, son.

26:21.248 --> 26:22.416
My God.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.336
You're go for Castle Bravo!

26:26.336 --> 26:28.130
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

26:28.130 --> 26:31.592
<i>Transmitting detonation signal
to Castle Bravo in 30 seconds!</i>

26:40.350 --> 26:46.857
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

26:49.067 --> 26:51.403
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Kei. It's over.

26:51.403 --> 26:52.487
I have to stop it!

26:52.487 --> 26:53.906
Stop!!

26:53.906 --> 26:56.158
<i>- ...two, one.</i>
- Please don't do it!

26:56.158 --> 26:57.284
You can't do this!

26:57.284 --> 26:58.452
Please!

27:12.925 --> 27:14.593
Magnificent.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.138
Yeah, it was.

28:04.476 --> 28:05.686
What have we done?

28:13.944 --> 28:15.529
Was this our father's real life?

28:15.529 --> 28:17.948
When he said he was at
a software developers conference,

28:17.948 --> 28:20.868
was he really sneaking across borders
and chasing monsters?

28:20.868 --> 28:24.955
Well, the cowboy days were behind us
by the time Hiroshi came on board.

28:24.955 --> 28:28.000
Monarch was mainly counting beans
and crunching numbers.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.334
"Data-driven," they called it.

28:29.334 --> 28:31.170
When was the last time you saw him?

28:31.170 --> 28:32.921
I don't know. Almost 20 years ago.

28:32.921 --> 28:34.715
When I was already a dinosaur.

28:37.801 --> 28:41.638
If you two are looking for some insight
into your situation,

28:41.638 --> 28:45.267
I got nothing.
I mean, Hiro was just a normal kid.

28:46.310 --> 28:48.979
He didn't torture small animals.

28:48.979 --> 28:50.981
No issues potty training.

28:50.981 --> 28:53.358
Classic profile of a sociopath.

28:53.358 --> 28:54.818
"Seemed like a nice guy.

28:54.818 --> 28:57.154
- Who would have suspected?"
- Can you give it a rest?

28:57.154 --> 28:59.489
Took after his mom. I can tell you that.

29:00.199 --> 29:01.491
Went after whatever he wanted,

29:01.491 --> 29:03.702
and he never let anything get in his way.

29:03.702 --> 29:05.162
And he never lied to me.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.958
This is a secret, Cate, not a lie.

29:09.958 --> 29:12.461
It seems like a distinction
without a difference.

29:12.461 --> 29:13.629
Not to me.

29:13.629 --> 29:17.382
I hate to interrupt family therapy,
but I think I found something.

29:17.382 --> 29:19.384
So I've been searching up
the keyword "Alaska,"

29:19.384 --> 29:24.306
and all that comes up is missing
dogsledders and "Yukon Yeti" sightings.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.850
But, you said "data-driven,"

29:26.850 --> 29:29.686
so I did a numerical search
to see if I got a hit

29:29.686 --> 29:31.855
on the longitude or latitude of Alaska.

29:32.564 --> 29:34.608
That's Billy's handwriting there.

29:34.608 --> 29:37.319
Yeah. These are geo-coordinates
from all over the world.

29:37.319 --> 29:39.947
I mean, Mexico, Asian steppes,
North Africa.

29:39.947 --> 29:43.033
And everything on the list is checked off
except for this one.

29:43.033 --> 29:45.077
And when I put it into the map...

29:45.911 --> 29:47.287
Oh, yeah.

29:47.287 --> 29:50.624
If we knew where your father's airplane
was heading when he disappeared,

29:50.624 --> 29:52.709
I could pinpoint this.

29:52.709 --> 29:55.754
It was flight 74-something.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.923
Filed a flight plan from Nome to Barrow.

29:57.923 --> 29:59.174
Nome to Barrow.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.134
Bingo.

30:02.553 --> 30:04.471
I owe you two a steak dinner for this.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.890
Time to cowboy up, Du-Ho.

30:06.890 --> 30:09.059
- We got a new destination.
- I got it.

30:09.059 --> 30:11.562
What does it mean?
Why was he going to Barrow?

30:11.562 --> 30:13.105
Nah, he was headed to Barrow.

30:14.439 --> 30:16.108
That's not where he was going.

30:23.615 --> 30:24.616
Keiko?

30:35.502 --> 30:36.503
You okay?

30:37.296 --> 30:38.755
He shouldn't have stopped me.

30:39.756 --> 30:42.176
Yeah, he was being selfish.

30:44.303 --> 30:45.804
What would've happened if he hadn't?

30:47.431 --> 30:49.766
You'd have been fired, arrested,
probably deported.

30:50.976 --> 30:52.978
They would have set off that bomb anyway.

30:56.523 --> 30:58.901
General called me in
to discuss our funding.

31:01.486 --> 31:04.448
I figured,
since we were going down anyway,

31:04.448 --> 31:06.325
might as well shoot for the moon.

31:08.202 --> 31:10.871
So I gave him a proposal,
a string of Monarch outposts,

31:10.871 --> 31:13.040
extra staff, monitoring equipment,
the works.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.044
He rejected it...

31:21.715 --> 31:23.509
said we didn't ask for enough.

31:28.055 --> 31:30.724
They are giving us a blank check

31:30.724 --> 31:34.186
to find out
if there are more of those out there.

31:34.186 --> 31:36.188
How the hell did you pull that off?

31:36.188 --> 31:37.689
Well, I asked a simple question.

31:37.689 --> 31:40.317
What if the next one doesn't pop up
in the middle of the Pacific?

31:40.317 --> 31:44.363
- What if it's near New York or Washington?
- Well, then we gotta tell the whole world.

31:44.363 --> 31:46.073
You're saying that you want to go public

31:46.073 --> 31:48.450
with the details
of a classified H-bomb explosion?

31:49.076 --> 31:51.537
- Why not?
- Because they electrocuted the Rosenbergs.

31:51.537 --> 31:52.829
What if--

31:56.917 --> 31:58.210
Say we find another one...

32:00.712 --> 32:02.422
does the general need to know everything?

32:03.423 --> 32:06.218
I'm sorry, are you suggesting
that I lie to my superior officer?

32:06.218 --> 32:11.807
No. But a lie and a secret
are two different things.

32:11.807 --> 32:15.602
I'm not sure the court-martial tribunal
would see that distinction, Kei.

32:18.230 --> 32:19.231
Do you trust us?

32:24.486 --> 32:25.904
Do you trust her?

32:27.948 --> 32:28.949
Okay.

32:31.952 --> 32:36.373
All that I can tell him
is what you tell me.

32:38.125 --> 32:44.506
And I trust that you will tell me
everything that I need to know.

32:47.759 --> 32:49.261
Are you okay with that?

32:50.929 --> 32:51.930
Are you?

32:58.020 --> 32:59.021
I'm fine with it.

33:03.108 --> 33:05.652
- Yeah. Right?
- Okay.

33:05.652 --> 33:07.446
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.625
It's all okay.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.169
Good morning.

33:25.214 --> 33:26.215
Where are we?

33:26.757 --> 33:29.343
US of A. We come to Papa soon.

33:32.596 --> 33:34.139
Not looking forward to reunion?

33:35.599 --> 33:38.644
What is it to you?
Are you, like, another one of his sons?

33:39.645 --> 33:41.230
Sorry. Didn't mean to pry.

33:44.858 --> 33:45.859
I'm sorry.

33:45.859 --> 33:48.195
It's just,
I don't know what I'm more afraid of:

33:48.946 --> 33:51.323
That we don't find Dad, or we do.

33:53.367 --> 33:57.287
Feels like a punch in the gut either way,
and I don't know how many more I can take.

34:00.165 --> 34:01.625
Let me tell you a secret.

34:02.417 --> 34:06.046
You don't appreciate life so much
until you're afraid to lose it.

34:07.214 --> 34:09.507
Not so much
when you see other people lose theirs.

34:10.592 --> 34:12.469
I saw many people die.

34:12.469 --> 34:15.514
My father, good friends.

34:16.598 --> 34:19.935
You get out of the bed each morning,
you roll the dice.

34:20.726 --> 34:25.107
Terrible things may happen,
but you shouldn't hide from pain.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.400
Look at you.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.320
Hide under your covers
and never sneak into Korea,

34:30.320 --> 34:31.572
never meet Du-Ho

34:32.739 --> 34:35.826
and never have a chance to tell your papa
to go screw himself.

34:40.539 --> 34:43.125
- What was that?
- Hey, brother.

34:43.125 --> 34:45.252
I think we're getting close.

34:45.252 --> 34:46.962
I think this is the spot.

34:46.962 --> 34:49.255
Whatever Hiro was after,
I think we just found it.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.341
- I'll take it from here, Du-Ho.
- Your airplane.

34:51.341 --> 34:53.092
We're gonna do a little fancy flying here.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.512
Lock everything down back there.
It's gonna get rough.

34:55.512 --> 34:58.015
- What?
- No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

34:58.015 --> 34:59.892
I need you to stay up here. Buckle in.

35:00.434 --> 35:02.060
I mean, why is he flying?

35:02.060 --> 35:06.732
Lee Shaw is the best pilot I know
when flying by seat of the pants.

35:06.732 --> 35:08.275
Great. Now I'm gonna piss mine.

35:08.275 --> 35:10.819
Du-Ho usually keeps something
underneath the seat there,

35:10.819 --> 35:12.237
in case of emergencies.

35:12.237 --> 35:14.489
Yeah, that's it. Unscrew the cap.

35:15.449 --> 35:17.784
Take a shot, a big one. Gonna need it.

35:19.369 --> 35:20.370
It's just water.

35:20.370 --> 35:23.207
Put the cap back on.
Put it right up here where I can see it.

35:24.041 --> 35:26.376
Yeah. All right.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.295
Now we got an attitude indicator.

35:28.295 --> 35:29.505
Here we go!

35:34.927 --> 35:36.136
Holy shit!

35:37.596 --> 35:39.056
Oh, my God! Stop!

35:39.848 --> 35:42.893
- Come on, baby.
- Shaw!

35:45.270 --> 35:46.480
Level out!

35:46.480 --> 35:48.190
There. We can land there.

35:48.190 --> 35:50.859
- This is gonna be rough, guys. Hang on.
- Shit!

35:50.859 --> 35:52.694
What's that down there?

35:52.694 --> 35:54.738
- What? Wait, what?
- Hang on to something.

35:57.574 --> 35:58.784
Here we go!

36:14.466 --> 36:16.677
Everybody in one piece back there?

36:16.677 --> 36:21.098
Brother, your landings
can use a little work.

36:22.432 --> 36:24.101
Hell of a job, copilot.

36:39.950 --> 36:40.951
Oh, no.

37:03.348 --> 37:04.349
I don't need to see him.

37:28.790 --> 37:29.917
It's not him.

37:37.424 --> 37:41.136
His seat belt's unbuckled.
Maybe he got thrown free.

37:43.472 --> 37:44.473
Wow.

37:45.307 --> 37:46.975
I'll be a monkey's naked uncle!

38:01.365 --> 38:03.659
Oh, my God. Do you think anyone's there?

38:39.862 --> 38:44.241
So, if everyone died in the crash,
who set all this gear up?

38:51.957 --> 38:53.542
I know that handwriting.

38:56.086 --> 38:57.087
Me too.

39:04.428 --> 39:05.804
He survived.

39:09.433 --> 39:10.642
He survived.

39:53.227 --> 39:54.394
It landed.

39:55.187 --> 39:56.355
Safely.

40:17.459 --> 40:18.627
We go now!

40:25.884 --> 40:28.470
I taxi the plane. You come quick!

40:28.470 --> 40:29.555
Move!

40:30.138 --> 40:32.808
Go, go! Let's go!

40:51.785 --> 40:53.787
- Come on!
- Just get to the plane!

40:59.918 --> 41:01.003
Shit.

41:28.197 --> 41:29.239
Oh, no.

41:34.578 --> 41:35.579
Whoa!
