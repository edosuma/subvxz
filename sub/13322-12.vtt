WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:03.267
I wanna go to Juilliard
more than anything.

00:04.080 --> 00:06.130
You've committed academic fraud.

00:06.165 --> 00:07.181
What does... What does that mean?

00:07.216 --> 00:09.233
You're not going to Juilliard.

00:09.268 --> 00:12.152
There was more DNA on the murder weapon.

00:12.204 --> 00:13.153
Besides Kyle's.

00:13.205 --> 00:15.038
That kid is a monster.

00:15.091 --> 00:17.007
You! Need to let this go!

00:17.042 --> 00:18.442
- You wanna let a killer back...
- Watch out!

00:20.583 --> 00:21.665
Hey!

00:21.717 --> 00:24.167
This young man was stalking my daughter.

00:24.203 --> 00:25.402
He broke into our house.

00:25.454 --> 00:28.171
Jesus thought that
Nick was gonna hurt me.

00:28.223 --> 00:29.556
He's gonna be okay.

00:29.592 --> 00:31.491
He wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you.

00:31.527 --> 00:32.576
Hey, I need a doctor,
please, I need a doctor

00:32.610 --> 00:34.578
please, I need a doctor, somebody!

00:34.630 --> 00:36.513
You're gonna put a bolt into his head?

00:36.548 --> 00:37.514
We have to.

00:37.549 --> 00:39.366
If the swelling continues,

00:39.418 --> 00:41.418
it can press down on the spinal column,

00:41.453 --> 00:45.405
severing the connection between
the two, which... could be fatal.

01:06.178 --> 01:07.127
Hello?

01:12.618 --> 01:14.251
Hey!

01:18.657 --> 01:19.606
Hello?

01:21.243 --> 01:22.626
Yo, is anyone here?

02:20.669 --> 02:22.469
Oh my God...

02:29.511 --> 02:31.478
What are you doing here?

02:31.513 --> 02:33.363
The new owners are gonna be here soon.

02:33.415 --> 02:35.332
Where's my family?

02:35.367 --> 02:37.350
- They moved.
- Where?

02:37.386 --> 02:39.319
They didn't leave a forwarding address.

02:39.354 --> 02:40.520
They left me... behind?

02:40.522 --> 02:43.290
Well... one less mouth to feed, right?

02:49.248 --> 02:52.215
You should go. You
don't live here anymore.

02:52.267 --> 02:56.670
You don't live here anymore.

02:56.705 --> 02:59.172
- Mariana?
- This way.

03:21.597 --> 03:23.396
Not that one.

03:25.451 --> 03:27.334
Don't let him get you!

03:30.355 --> 03:32.272
We're here, baby, we're here.

03:38.363 --> 03:41.414
We're right here. We love you.

03:41.416 --> 03:43.287
Well, we can't charge
her with hit and run

03:43.288 --> 03:44.529
if she had cause to leave the scene.

03:44.586 --> 03:47.520
- What cause?
- She said she was afraid of Troy Johnson.

03:47.522 --> 03:48.571
Said he wouldn't let her out of his car.

03:48.623 --> 03:50.373
You believe that?

03:50.425 --> 03:51.858
Might explain why he left the scene.

03:51.893 --> 03:54.861
This girl's been harassing everyone
involved in the Kyle Snow case.

03:54.896 --> 03:56.746
And now the victim's grandson.

03:56.798 --> 04:00.800
Look... her mom's a cop. Maybe
we oughta give her a call.

04:00.802 --> 04:03.319
I know the mother.
She's not a team player.

04:03.372 --> 04:06.339
Besides, if she wanted Mom
here, she'd have brought her.

04:07.809 --> 04:10.326
Some guy just came in with his lawyer.

04:10.362 --> 04:12.662
Says he was involved in
an accident this afternoon.

04:12.698 --> 04:14.681
- What's his name?
- Troy Johnson.

04:14.683 --> 04:16.649
You want me to put him in a room?

04:16.651 --> 04:17.649
Yeah.

04:55.673 --> 05:00.673
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:06.506 --> 05:09.507
Okay, uh... we should
clean up, for Moms.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.595
Why were you hanging out with Nick?

05:13.597 --> 05:15.597
I wasn't... hanging out with him.

05:15.599 --> 05:17.565
He was stalking me at the festival.

05:17.601 --> 05:18.600
Well, where is he now?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.651
Jail, probably.

05:19.686 --> 05:20.685
Police took him away.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.654
Yeah, and I hope they never let him out.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.572
What if he escapes and comes here again?

05:24.608 --> 05:26.524
He can't.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.692
What if he's already here?

05:27.744 --> 05:30.528
Maybe he's hiding in
the garage or the attic.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.663
Okay, that's... that's not funny.

05:31.698 --> 05:32.697
Can you take out the garbage?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.532
In the dark?

05:34.584 --> 05:35.583
I mean, seriously,

05:35.619 --> 05:36.584
what if he is out there?

05:36.620 --> 05:37.702
Okay, are you still stoned?

05:37.754 --> 05:40.622
Again? What are you, a pothead?

05:40.624 --> 05:43.675
No. At least I'm not poppin' pills.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.762
Okay, I was taking those to study.

05:47.114 --> 05:50.198
Not party. Jeez, Jude, you're only 14.

05:50.234 --> 05:51.316
Where's Callie?

05:51.368 --> 05:54.152
Why isn't she helping?

05:54.204 --> 05:56.071
Probably with AJ.

05:56.073 --> 05:57.239
Having sex.

05:57.241 --> 05:58.240
I hope you're not having sex.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.208
Hashtag, none of your business.

06:02.079 --> 06:03.128
Okay, whatever.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.247
I'll finish this in the
morning. I'm going to bed.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.083
Me, too.

06:26.171 --> 06:29.269
My client left the scene of the
accident to get medical attention,

06:29.275 --> 06:31.156
as you can see, which is
his right under the law.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.191
He cannot be charged with hit and run.

06:33.243 --> 06:36.111
And he's coming in of his own
volition to report the incident.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.162
Got it.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.248
So, why don't you tell me what happened.

06:42.286 --> 06:43.285
Callie?

06:45.122 --> 06:46.288
Sorry.

06:46.290 --> 06:47.289
It's okay, but I gotta ask you

06:47.424 --> 06:49.124
to turn your phone
off during questioning,

06:49.176 --> 06:50.258
it's department policy.

06:50.294 --> 06:52.127
Okay.

06:52.319 --> 06:54.402
So, you say Troy Johnson approached you

06:54.438 --> 06:56.238
at the Festival on the Marina.

06:56.273 --> 06:59.274
Yes, um... I guess he heard

06:59.276 --> 07:01.243
that I was raising money

07:01.278 --> 07:02.327
to help Kyle.

07:02.362 --> 07:04.329
He murdered my grandmother.

07:04.364 --> 07:05.413
And I simply asked her

07:05.449 --> 07:07.282
why she'd wanna help a killer go free,

07:07.284 --> 07:09.284
and then she got really hostile.

07:09.336 --> 07:10.335
He got really upset.

07:10.370 --> 07:11.369
So how'd you end up in his car?

07:11.421 --> 07:13.421
Well, I ran into Troy
at the parking lot.

07:13.457 --> 07:16.291
And he apologized for
getting mad earlier.

07:16.343 --> 07:19.177
She apologized for
getting angry earlier.

07:19.212 --> 07:20.428
She told me that her sister was missing.

07:20.464 --> 07:23.265
He said he saw Mariana
getting in somebody's car.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.267
She asked me if she could get in my car.

07:25.302 --> 07:26.351
He told me to get in his car.

07:26.386 --> 07:28.386
And you're ridin' around
lookin' for your sister.

07:28.438 --> 07:29.437
Then what happened?

07:29.473 --> 07:31.473
She started going on about how...

07:31.475 --> 07:35.226
Kyle was innocent,
and that he was framed

07:35.279 --> 07:36.311
by the police.

07:37.397 --> 07:41.316
I got a call that said
they found Mariana,

07:41.318 --> 07:42.367
so I asked him to take me back.

07:42.402 --> 07:45.287
I told her that I was
going to take her back.

07:45.322 --> 07:47.322
But... he just kept driving,

07:47.324 --> 07:51.326
like faster, and he was saying
that Kyle was the killer,

07:51.328 --> 07:53.328
and that I had no
right to be helping him,

07:53.330 --> 07:54.546
and he was waving...

07:54.581 --> 07:56.431
... waving her hands in my face.

07:56.466 --> 07:59.301
Insisting that Kyle
didn't kill my grandmother,

07:59.353 --> 08:03.138
and accusing me of putting
an innocent man away for life.

08:03.173 --> 08:04.205
She just got so worked up.

08:04.241 --> 08:05.256
And he wasn't watching the road,

08:05.292 --> 08:07.258
and we were drifting
over the line, so...

08:07.294 --> 08:09.110
- She grabbed the wheel.
- I grabbed the wheel.

08:09.112 --> 08:11.079
It's like she was trying
to run us off the road.

08:11.114 --> 08:12.247
We were gonna run into an oncoming car,

08:12.299 --> 08:14.249
and then he grabbed the wheel back...

08:14.301 --> 08:17.018
I had to yank the wheel so hard...

08:17.070 --> 08:18.119
We hit another car.

08:18.155 --> 08:19.154
What happened after
you hit this other car?

08:19.206 --> 08:22.007
I was hurt... and dazed,

08:22.042 --> 08:24.109
but I heard her get out and call 9-1-1.

08:24.144 --> 08:27.062
So I started to see if the
people in the other car were okay.

08:27.097 --> 08:30.131
But he started coming after
me, like he wanted to kill me.

08:30.167 --> 08:32.467
I asked her to help the other
people, but then she just took off.

08:32.501 --> 08:35.386
I was bleeding, so I decided to
drive myself to an urgent care.

08:35.438 --> 08:36.404
So why do you think she ran?

08:36.440 --> 08:37.455
She knew she caused the accident.

08:37.491 --> 08:39.073
Because he caused the accident.

08:39.126 --> 08:40.457
She's at fault here.

08:40.510 --> 08:43.345
Would you say this was your fault...

08:43.347 --> 08:44.362
gettin' in his car?

08:47.451 --> 08:49.334
Yeah, that was my fault.

09:23.806 --> 09:25.673
What are you doing here?

09:25.675 --> 09:26.807
I need to talk to you.

09:32.748 --> 09:34.715
Hey, Foster, you got a minute?

09:34.750 --> 09:36.050
Yeah, what's up?

09:36.085 --> 09:37.017
I'll be in there.

09:38.604 --> 09:41.572
Stef Adams Foster. She
got a kid named Callie?

09:41.624 --> 09:42.640
Yeah, why?

09:52.034 --> 09:54.918
Hey... so what are you thinkin'?

09:54.970 --> 09:57.638
Well, now it sounds like
a he said, she said to me.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.024
Except she said's been in a
group home and juvie twice.

10:00.076 --> 10:03.043
She's been questioned about
her involvement in a kidnapping,

10:03.079 --> 10:05.846
and she's got a recent
harassment complaint.

10:05.848 --> 10:07.931
Whereas Troy Johnson's squeaky clean.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.917
Not even an outstanding parking ticket.

10:09.952 --> 10:13.037
Hey... you questioning Callie
Adams Foster on a hit and run?

10:13.089 --> 10:14.888
Yeah, you know her?

10:14.924 --> 10:16.023
Yeah, her mom's my ex-wife.

10:16.058 --> 10:18.776
My condolences.

10:18.828 --> 10:20.744
- Aren't you homicide?
- What's it to you?

10:21.964 --> 10:24.765
Her mom's a cop. Does
she know about this?

10:24.767 --> 10:25.933
I don't need permission
to question a minor.

10:25.985 --> 10:28.786
How about professional courtesy?

10:28.821 --> 10:29.870
That cuts both ways.

10:29.872 --> 10:32.773
- Can I talk to her?
- No.

10:32.808 --> 10:35.743
Why don't you go do your
job... and let us do ours?

10:42.818 --> 10:47.654
If it were my case, I'd make a
decision before Mama Bear gets here.

10:47.707 --> 10:50.090
Well... it's not your case.

10:51.727 --> 10:53.644
Maybe you should go home

10:53.696 --> 10:54.695
Let me do my job.

10:58.718 --> 11:00.601
Brandon's checkin' in.

11:04.073 --> 11:09.643
Uh... we need to talk
about Brandon and Juilliard.

11:09.678 --> 11:11.895
Yeah... I know.

11:11.931 --> 11:14.948
Uh... I hate to say it,
but I think he's gonna

11:15.000 --> 11:16.950
have to apply for student loans, hmm?

11:19.972 --> 11:21.889
- Excuse me?
- What is that?

11:27.046 --> 11:29.897
What is that?

11:29.932 --> 11:32.900
It's uh, just a little air in
the lines, nothing to worry about.

11:32.902 --> 11:33.951
- You sure?
- Yeah.

11:33.986 --> 11:35.753
We need to check his catheter.

11:35.805 --> 11:36.920
You all may wanna leave for this.

11:38.924 --> 11:40.891
- Okay... okay?
- Yeah.

11:40.943 --> 11:43.777
- Want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

11:43.813 --> 11:44.828
All right. I'll be right back.

11:56.709 --> 11:58.709
How was Nick texting you from juvie?

12:00.079 --> 12:01.712
I don't know.

12:01.797 --> 12:03.046
I guess they sneak phones in there.

12:03.082 --> 12:05.048
And you went to see him, again?

12:06.802 --> 12:08.018
Just once.

12:09.655 --> 12:12.573
At the Boy's Correctional
Facility, just through the fence.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.396
I just don't understand
why you were letting him

12:14.397 --> 12:16.090
think he was your boyfriend,

12:16.095 --> 12:18.028
I mean... unless...

12:18.063 --> 12:19.613
is that what you want?

12:19.665 --> 12:20.914
No.

12:23.085 --> 12:24.668
I'm scared of him.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.087
He's sick. He kept telling me
that he was gonna kill himself.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.989
I didn't know what to do.

12:28.991 --> 12:29.990
You could have talked to me.

12:31.994 --> 12:33.811
You could have told me the truth.

12:34.897 --> 12:36.864
I was afraid you'd break up with me.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.835
After everything we've been through...

12:41.887 --> 12:44.938
I love you so much, I...
I can't lose you again.

12:44.990 --> 12:47.741
You're not gonna lose me.

12:49.845 --> 12:51.678
Do you still love me?

12:51.730 --> 12:52.863
Of course I do.

13:03.826 --> 13:06.660
Mariana...

13:06.662 --> 13:07.678
I want to.

13:10.733 --> 13:12.065
I want you.

13:36.108 --> 13:39.943
Hey, sorry to keep you
waitin', it's a... busy night.

13:39.979 --> 13:42.012
But... brought you a snack and a soda.

13:42.047 --> 13:44.047
Figured you must be hungry.

13:44.099 --> 13:46.033
I'm okay.

13:46.068 --> 13:47.901
You did the right thing by comin' in.

13:47.953 --> 13:48.952
We really appreciate it.

13:49.955 --> 13:51.722
Can I go home?

13:51.757 --> 13:52.839
Soon as you read this.

13:52.892 --> 13:54.808
What is it?

13:54.860 --> 13:56.693
It's your statement,
it's just a formality.

13:57.746 --> 13:59.830
Soon as you sign it...
we're all done here.

14:23.656 --> 14:25.589
Thanks. I'll be right back.

14:42.195 --> 14:44.112
Did the swelling go down, at all?

14:44.164 --> 14:45.346
No, not yet.

14:45.381 --> 14:47.131
I'm gonna ask the doctor if
I can order some steroids.

14:47.183 --> 14:49.100
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:18.982 --> 15:20.848
I'm here.

15:27.006 --> 15:28.940
I'm here.

15:28.942 --> 15:31.943
- Mama!
- Jesus. I'm here, Jesus.

15:31.945 --> 15:33.878
Mama!

15:34.964 --> 15:36.797
Mama!

15:46.226 --> 15:47.191
Dude.

15:48.194 --> 15:49.160
Oh.

15:51.130 --> 15:54.182
Uh... Wait, wait, wait.
What's... what's going on?

15:54.234 --> 15:57.101
Sorry... you're too dumb for me.

16:02.141 --> 16:05.142
Let me in, please, i... i...
it's Mariana, Mariana Foster.

16:05.195 --> 16:07.078
Mariana?

16:07.080 --> 16:09.046
Please let me in, it's Mariana.

16:09.048 --> 16:10.047
This is a code blue...

16:10.049 --> 16:11.098
Mariana?

16:11.134 --> 16:12.884
Please, let me in.

16:12.936 --> 16:13.935
Mariana!

16:13.970 --> 16:15.987
This is a code blue,
this is not a drill.

16:18.124 --> 16:20.841
Code blue, this is a code blue.

16:29.953 --> 16:32.937
- Mariana?
- Don't let him get you.

16:32.972 --> 16:34.755
Who?

16:39.963 --> 16:41.229
Nick?

16:50.857 --> 16:51.856
No.

17:09.108 --> 17:11.142
What's goin' on?

17:11.176 --> 17:12.960
Uh, she's flushing the line,

17:12.996 --> 17:15.096
and the doctor ordered more steroids.

17:15.131 --> 17:16.130
- Thank you.
- Okay.

17:16.182 --> 17:18.983
Should we, uh... are we worried?

17:19.035 --> 17:21.152
Should we be seeing some
reduction in swelling by now?

17:21.154 --> 17:24.005
It takes time. Every case is different.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.006
Hopefully this should help.

17:26.059 --> 17:27.008
Try not to worry.

17:28.060 --> 17:29.060
Thank you.

17:38.855 --> 17:41.922
Oh... I read that you should
play music for coma patients,

17:41.958 --> 17:45.009
and... Jesus loves Christmas, so...

17:47.814 --> 17:48.621
He also loves heavy metal,

17:48.622 --> 17:50.845
and I don't know how well
that's gonna go over up here.

17:52.919 --> 17:55.853
- It's silly.
- It's not silly, leave it.

18:01.828 --> 18:02.793
My phone.

18:05.181 --> 18:08.149
Mike's tryin' to get in touch with me.

18:27.153 --> 18:29.036
So what was goin' on at the Marina?

18:30.123 --> 18:32.006
Who were you... runnin' from?

18:33.059 --> 18:35.142
Just some kids who were bein' jerks.

18:37.997 --> 18:39.864
I didn't see any kids.

18:42.035 --> 18:43.901
Just tell me.

18:43.936 --> 18:45.019
All right.

18:45.071 --> 18:50.007
We... snuck onto someone's
boat, and then the guy got on,

18:50.043 --> 18:52.043
and... almost sailed away with us.

18:52.045 --> 18:56.947
Uh... okay, so you were
smoking weed, and trespassing.

18:56.999 --> 18:57.998
Nice.

18:58.034 --> 19:01.752
Okay... pot's legal in a lotta states.

19:01.804 --> 19:04.722
There's nothing wrong with
it... I mean, it's natural.

19:04.724 --> 19:07.792
And... a lotta people
use it for, like...

19:07.827 --> 19:08.876
medical problems.

19:08.928 --> 19:11.762
Yeah... adult people, Jude.

19:11.764 --> 19:13.814
Y... your brain is still
developing. Pot can screw it up.

19:13.850 --> 19:15.116
Where'd you hear that?

19:15.151 --> 19:16.167
Look it up.

19:16.202 --> 19:17.752
And don't be an idiot.

19:19.138 --> 19:21.722
Some mistakes you can't... take back.

19:21.774 --> 19:22.740
Whatever.

19:22.775 --> 19:24.742
And don't be an ass.

19:24.744 --> 19:26.177
Come on.

19:33.069 --> 19:34.060
Hey, you know, what happened

19:34.061 --> 19:35.861
to that nice kid that
came to live with us?

19:36.205 --> 19:38.105
I miss him.

20:02.999 --> 20:05.049
- Hey.
- Hey... where's Callie?

20:05.084 --> 20:07.017
Room one.

20:07.019 --> 20:08.936
Hey, hey, hey, wait,
wait, wait, I'm her mother.

20:08.988 --> 20:10.855
What's goin' on, why is she in cuffs?

20:10.857 --> 20:12.990
She's under arrest. Vehicular
assault and felony hit and run.

20:12.992 --> 20:14.792
Okay, based on what?

20:14.827 --> 20:15.759
On her own statement.

20:15.812 --> 20:16.811
You are aware that she's a minor,

20:16.846 --> 20:17.928
you questioned her
without a parent present.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.230
- She came in on her own.
- You know what?

20:19.282 --> 20:20.948
I'm sorry, I didn't want to bother you,

20:20.983 --> 20:22.833
- but I didn't think I was gonna be in trouble.
- It's okay, baby.

20:22.885 --> 20:24.802
It's all right. May I please
talk with you in private?

20:24.837 --> 20:26.787
Please, she's not going anywhere.

20:27.940 --> 20:29.807
- She's fine there.
- Don't move.

20:35.882 --> 20:37.348
Okay.

20:37.383 --> 20:39.800
Listen, I understand that Detective
Gray had something to do with this?

20:39.836 --> 20:41.235
- I'm the arresting officer here.
- I understand that...

20:41.287 --> 20:43.204
And I don't appreciate you
comin' through here and tellin' me

20:43.239 --> 20:44.788
- how to do my job.
- I am not coming here to...

20:44.841 --> 20:46.090
If you had your daughter at home...

20:46.142 --> 20:48.142
You're a liar. I know you
killed your grandmother,

20:48.177 --> 20:50.144
- and we're gonna prove it.
- You're crazy.

20:50.179 --> 20:51.195
- Come on...
- I'm telling you is that...

20:51.247 --> 20:53.164
Hey... she's crazy, okay?
Keep her away from me,

20:53.199 --> 20:54.331
or I'm gonna file a restraining order.

20:54.383 --> 20:57.101
- Keep moving...
- You know what... Hey, hey, listen...

20:57.136 --> 20:58.235
- Let's go.
- May I please... Listen,

20:58.271 --> 20:59.937
may I please speak with my daughter

20:59.989 --> 21:01.071
- for one minute?
- You can visit her at juvie.

21:01.123 --> 21:02.957
Where are you taking her?

21:02.992 --> 21:04.008
Chula Vista.

21:04.010 --> 21:05.059
- Come on!
- That's high security,

21:05.094 --> 21:06.393
you don't need to take her there.

21:06.429 --> 21:09.113
- She's got a bed.
- How long have you been Gray's bitch, huh?

21:09.165 --> 21:11.081
- You really need to step aside.
- Get off, Mike.

21:11.133 --> 21:13.050
You need to let me talk to my daughter.

21:13.085 --> 21:16.354
Listen... you don't
say a word to anybody.

21:16.355 --> 21:18.515
You keep your head down,
do as they tell you,

21:18.574 --> 21:20.641
and I am gonna come and get you
outta there as soon as I can,

21:20.677 --> 21:21.842
- do you hear me?
- I'm sorry.

21:21.878 --> 21:24.011
It's okay, don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

21:24.046 --> 21:26.030
Okay? It's gonna be okay, baby.

21:29.952 --> 21:31.590
It's okay, baby, don't worry.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.761
I'm gonna get you.
Okay? I'm gonna get you.

22:30.460 --> 22:32.410
I can't believe all this is happening.

22:32.412 --> 22:35.413
I know. I'm gonna read
the statement Callie made

22:35.465 --> 22:37.432
to the police, make a
few calls, see how fast

22:37.484 --> 22:42.286
we can get her in front of
a judge. How's Jesus doing?

22:42.338 --> 22:46.441
Uhh... the last time they
checked there was no change, so...

22:46.476 --> 22:49.393
Hey, I'll be back as
soon as I can. I love you.

22:49.395 --> 22:50.394
Yeah.

23:11.668 --> 23:13.584
May I sit with you?

23:26.616 --> 23:29.567
- Are you injured or intoxicated?
- No.

23:36.609 --> 23:38.493
Not your first time.

23:42.382 --> 23:44.432
No drug history, no tattoos.

23:44.467 --> 23:47.518
Ears, no body piercings,
and no gang affiliations,

23:47.570 --> 23:49.453
and I'm not suicidal.

23:49.489 --> 23:53.307
Okay. This is a Prison Rape
Elimination Act questionnaire.

23:53.343 --> 23:55.510
- Sit down.
- I've... filled this out before.

23:55.595 --> 23:57.395
Fill it out again.

24:07.604 --> 24:09.143
_

24:09.144 --> 24:10.444
_

24:48.581 --> 24:51.465
Over there. The bottom one.

24:51.501 --> 24:53.045
Wake up's at six a.m.

24:53.046 --> 24:56.160
Don't get up unless you
need to use the bathroom.

25:15.358 --> 25:17.275
Yo, who's this?

25:18.745 --> 25:23.347
They're really good kids. They're
just making such bad decisions.

25:23.399 --> 25:25.366
You know why?

25:25.401 --> 25:27.770
The brain has its most
dramatic growth spurt

25:27.771 --> 25:29.715
after infancy and adolescence.

25:29.722 --> 25:31.722
They have no impulse control.

25:31.724 --> 25:33.357
It's like the terrible twos.

25:34.377 --> 25:36.244
Except now they can drive.

25:39.599 --> 25:42.700
I... I still feel like
I should be doing better.

25:42.735 --> 25:45.536
Listen... I have another daughter.

25:45.588 --> 25:46.637
She's a monster.

25:47.674 --> 25:49.490
No, really.

25:49.525 --> 25:52.460
Her sister's lying here
fighting for her life,

25:52.495 --> 25:53.544
and where is she?

25:54.597 --> 25:57.481
But, my Melanie...

25:57.533 --> 25:58.566
she has the biggest heart.

26:00.536 --> 26:03.421
And she's always cared
about helping other people.

26:06.442 --> 26:08.492
I think you're raising five Melanies.

26:09.545 --> 26:12.380
And it's something
you should be proud of.

26:12.432 --> 26:16.284
Because kind kids turn into kind adults.

26:16.336 --> 26:19.420
And God knows this world
could use a lot more of them.

26:21.391 --> 26:22.440
Like you.

26:22.475 --> 26:26.327
Oh, whoa, honey...
I can be a real bitch.

26:26.362 --> 26:28.296
No, seriously, I can.

26:33.353 --> 26:34.702
Is Melanie gonna be all right?

26:36.289 --> 26:37.254
Yeah, I think so.

26:37.290 --> 26:38.723
Her husband's on the way.

26:38.758 --> 26:42.243
He was in China, of all places.

26:42.278 --> 26:44.612
But... but I'll be here until he comes.

26:44.664 --> 26:48.599
Remember... you can handle
anything in the moment.

26:48.601 --> 26:51.535
It's our fear of what
might happen that undoes us.

26:54.674 --> 26:56.557
Good news. The swelling's gone down.

27:00.430 --> 27:01.579
You see?

27:05.601 --> 27:07.401
Oh, my.

27:15.228 --> 27:17.095
Hey. Come on.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.300
- Good news, right?
- Yeah.

27:38.369 --> 27:40.365
They're removing the...
the bolt from his head,

27:40.366 --> 27:41.946
and they're taking
him off the ventilator,

27:41.989 --> 27:46.925
so... you know, I mean, all
he has to do now is... wake up.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.561
Uh... did Mariana already do the dishes?

27:49.613 --> 27:52.614
Oh. No, I did them.

27:52.649 --> 27:54.666
- Hello?
- Hey.

27:54.701 --> 27:56.918
Hey.

27:56.970 --> 27:59.588
- You're up early.
- Wh... what are you doing here?

27:59.590 --> 28:00.939
I, uh, thought I'd make breakfast

28:00.974 --> 28:02.941
before you guys have to
go back to the hospital.

28:05.829 --> 28:06.995
Hey, good morning.

28:06.997 --> 28:08.830
Hey. Um...

28:09.900 --> 28:11.850
Did Callie spend the
night at your place?

28:11.902 --> 28:14.770
'Cause... she never
came home last night.

28:14.822 --> 28:15.854
Uh...

28:16.924 --> 28:18.907
No, Callie's not at my place.

28:18.959 --> 28:21.760
Listen, guys, your moms
wanted me to fill you in.

28:21.812 --> 28:22.844
On what?

28:22.896 --> 28:24.746
What's goin' on, where is she?

28:24.782 --> 28:26.748
Callie's in juvie.

28:36.794 --> 28:38.827
The bolt is out, and
he's breathing on his own.

28:38.862 --> 28:41.630
The swelling has gone
down significantly.

28:41.682 --> 28:43.698
However, he is running a fever.

28:43.734 --> 28:44.766
He's... Why?

28:44.818 --> 28:47.602
Damage to areas of the brain
such as the hypothalamus

28:47.654 --> 28:51.706
can disrupt the body's ability to
manage its own autonomic functions.

28:51.708 --> 28:54.227
We're going to put Jesus
onto a cooling blanket

28:54.228 --> 28:55.528
and try to bring it down,

28:55.762 --> 28:57.696
before we consider other causes.

28:57.731 --> 29:02.634
- Like what?
- An infection in the brain. Or... pneumonia.

29:02.669 --> 29:06.555
Okay, and... and if that's what's...
going on, wha... what happens?

29:06.557 --> 29:09.608
Then we would have to worry
about any further brain damage.

29:09.660 --> 29:12.334
We would give him a
heavy load of antibiotics,

29:12.335 --> 29:14.963
and probably have to
put him back in a coma.

29:14.975 --> 29:18.827
But... let's hope that this works.

29:18.862 --> 29:20.690
"Let's hope that this
works." You guys, I...

29:20.691 --> 29:21.625
I feel like you're guessing

29:21.628 --> 29:23.181
- at what's wrong with him.
- We're not guessing.

29:23.216 --> 29:24.933
But, that's all we hear
around here with every case,

29:24.985 --> 29:26.860
is let's wait and see,
you know, let's hope...

29:26.861 --> 29:28.761
Let's give it some time...

29:28.855 --> 29:30.238
- Stef.
- What?

29:30.240 --> 29:33.124
I'm sorry. We... we know you're
doing... everything you can.

29:33.176 --> 29:35.143
Do we? Do we really know that
they're doing everything they can?

29:35.178 --> 29:37.228
- Look... I know that this is difficult...
- Because they don't seem to...

29:37.264 --> 29:38.085
- How... ?
- Believe me.

29:38.086 --> 29:42.106
Please. Just... try to hang in there.

29:42.119 --> 29:43.134
- Okay.
- Thanks.

29:43.170 --> 29:44.219
Try to hang in there.

29:56.874 --> 29:57.923
Hey, guys.

29:57.958 --> 29:58.957
Hey.

29:59.009 --> 30:00.792
Here's the, uh, clothes.

30:00.844 --> 30:01.927
Oh... thank you, sweetheart.

30:01.962 --> 30:03.945
So, listen, guys, everything
is, uh, everything's fine.

30:03.981 --> 30:06.493
Jesus is running a
little bit of a fever.

30:06.494 --> 30:08.270
But they're workin' to get it down,

30:08.276 --> 30:10.243
and they're just hoping
that he'll wake up soon.

30:10.278 --> 30:11.435
That's good to hear.

30:11.570 --> 30:13.487
That's great.

30:13.539 --> 30:14.621
What's happening with Callie?

30:14.673 --> 30:16.673
Uh... well, her detention
hearing is this afternoon.

30:16.709 --> 30:20.527
Uh, but we're hoping that the
judge will let her come home

30:20.562 --> 30:22.479
pending a formal petition of charges.

30:22.531 --> 30:23.730
Why didn't she tell
us she was in trouble?

30:23.782 --> 30:26.666
Well, because, uh, she didn't
know that even as a passenger,

30:26.702 --> 30:28.635
it's a crime to leave
the scene of an accident.

30:28.670 --> 30:31.455
But we're hoping the DA will
take that into consideration

30:31.490 --> 30:33.440
and just drop this whole thing.

30:34.493 --> 30:36.493
What was she doing in that
guy's car to begin with?

30:38.547 --> 30:40.464
Uh, she was looking for you, love.

31:21.757 --> 31:22.839
Moms...

31:26.728 --> 31:27.644
Moms.

31:47.549 --> 31:48.682
It's all your fault.

31:50.569 --> 31:52.419
We wish it were you.

31:53.589 --> 31:54.621
Jesus.

31:57.426 --> 31:58.458
Did you die?

31:59.595 --> 32:01.411
Are you dead?

32:01.447 --> 32:03.497
You were supposed to save me.

32:03.532 --> 32:04.581
I tried.

32:04.583 --> 32:06.500
I've always tried.

32:23.452 --> 32:24.484
I tried.

32:24.536 --> 32:25.752
He's after you.

32:27.806 --> 32:28.839
Who is?

32:28.891 --> 32:30.724
Nick?

32:36.715 --> 32:37.731
Me.

32:39.434 --> 32:40.717
You didn't save her.

32:58.587 --> 33:00.637
You were right.

33:00.689 --> 33:02.689
It's all my fault.

33:02.724 --> 33:04.608
Nick wasn't at the festival.

33:06.528 --> 33:07.661
What do you mean?

33:09.548 --> 33:13.517
When I called Jesus and said
that Nick was after me, he wasn't.

33:14.570 --> 33:15.652
I was just hallucinating.

33:16.705 --> 33:20.457
Jesus... called Nick
to see if he was there.

33:22.561 --> 33:24.644
That's how he knew where I was.

33:24.680 --> 33:28.448
And why he cut off his ankle bracelet.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.384
Jesus was just tryin' to help
me, and now he's in a coma.

33:37.859 --> 33:39.793
That was really messed up.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.797
I'm still really messed up.

33:45.551 --> 33:46.766
It's okay...

34:00.849 --> 34:04.751
So... you've been invited
to the party tonight.

34:04.786 --> 34:06.369
I'm not interested.

34:06.371 --> 34:07.721
What, you don't get high?

34:07.773 --> 34:10.690
I get high, just... going home today.

34:10.726 --> 34:12.692
Oh... well, good for you.

34:12.744 --> 34:13.777
Better for me.

34:21.737 --> 34:24.603
Okay, his core temperature
is below normal,

34:24.656 --> 34:27.824
so we're gonna warm him
up now... and hopefully,

34:27.826 --> 34:29.775
his temperature won't spike again.

34:31.730 --> 34:34.563
Uh... when will he wake up?

34:34.600 --> 34:35.799
Anytime.

34:35.833 --> 34:41.638
It could be minutes, hours,
days. But, keep talking to him.

34:41.672 --> 34:43.657
Some people say they can hear you.

34:43.692 --> 34:46.610
Hello, my name's, uh, Brandon Foster,

34:46.645 --> 34:51.464
uh, and I was... accepted
into your music program.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.255
But I... I made a
mistake, and I was just...

34:55.156 --> 34:56.507
wondering if I could talk to someone

34:56.521 --> 34:57.654
about my status to see if there's...

34:57.706 --> 34:59.622
something I could do.

35:03.512 --> 35:04.561
My spot's been taken.

35:08.483 --> 35:11.418
Uh, and... and there's noth...

35:11.453 --> 35:13.586
No, I know, I... I just thought th...

35:15.924 --> 35:17.540
I understand.

35:18.593 --> 35:20.427
Thank you.

35:31.556 --> 35:33.440
Have a good afternoon.

35:49.195 --> 35:50.327
What is that?

35:52.164 --> 35:53.280
It's his heart rate.

35:56.218 --> 35:59.219
- Hey, baby, wake up, sweetheart, wake up.
- Jesus.

36:00.306 --> 36:02.189
Can you hear us, baby?

36:02.224 --> 36:03.273
Jesus.

36:03.325 --> 36:06.076
Jesus... wake up, baby.

36:07.329 --> 36:09.296
Baby, we're right here.

36:09.331 --> 36:11.165
Wake up, honey.

36:11.167 --> 36:13.083
Come with me.

36:19.158 --> 36:20.157
Mama?

36:20.209 --> 36:21.241
This way.

36:23.279 --> 36:26.180
We don't have to hurt anymore.

36:26.215 --> 36:29.099
We can leave this world.

36:29.134 --> 36:31.018
This way.

36:31.020 --> 36:32.152
Jesus...

36:35.074 --> 36:36.123
Jesus, baby, wake up.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.093
Come with me.

36:40.095 --> 36:41.094
Take my hand.

36:41.096 --> 36:43.096
Wake up, Jesus. Wake up.

36:43.098 --> 36:46.016
- Jesus, come back to us.
- Wake up. Wake up.

36:46.068 --> 36:47.117
We're here.

36:47.152 --> 36:48.952
When you're ready.

36:49.004 --> 36:50.871
- Please wake up, Jesus.
- Let's go.

36:51.924 --> 36:53.957
We love you, Jesus.

36:54.009 --> 36:56.043
- Wake up, baby.
- Wake up, sweetheart.

36:56.095 --> 36:58.028
- Wake up, Jesus.
- Wake up.

37:00.032 --> 37:02.950
Jesu...

37:04.036 --> 37:05.919
Hey, baby, hey!

37:05.921 --> 37:09.840
- Hey, baby. It's okay.
- Don't be scared, don't be scared, you're safe.

37:09.892 --> 37:11.975
We're here. We got you.

37:13.862 --> 37:15.028
We're right here.

37:15.030 --> 37:16.914
Hi, baby.

37:19.868 --> 37:21.285
Shh, shh, shh.

37:21.337 --> 37:23.837
It's okay.

37:25.975 --> 37:28.976
Okay, okay. Just relax,
okay? No more talking.

37:30.312 --> 37:33.247
- No more talking.
- Can we get someone in here, please?

37:45.327 --> 37:46.860
Here you go.

37:46.912 --> 37:48.245
Oh, thanks.

38:03.305 --> 38:05.856
Someone had a long nap, huh?

38:05.891 --> 38:08.141
Okay, deep breath.

38:13.332 --> 38:16.249
Excuse me... are you Melanie's husband?

38:16.301 --> 38:18.135
Yes. Are you a friend of hers?

38:18.170 --> 38:20.153
No, my, uh, my son is next door.

38:20.189 --> 38:22.189
How is she, your wife?

38:22.191 --> 38:24.207
Better. They say she's gonna make it.

38:24.243 --> 38:26.159
I'm so glad.

38:26.211 --> 38:29.262
- Your son?
- Yes, he is, uh, awake.

38:31.133 --> 38:33.133
Is your mother-in-law still here?

38:33.135 --> 38:34.234
I wanna thank her.

38:34.269 --> 38:36.269
She really... helped me
get through a rough night.

38:36.271 --> 38:38.238
My mother-in-law?

38:38.240 --> 38:43.093
Yes, um... I just realized
she never told me her name.

38:44.296 --> 38:47.064
She said she was Melanie's mother?

38:47.099 --> 38:50.016
Yes. She told me that you
were traveling back from China?

38:50.102 --> 38:55.122
That's right. But, uh...

38:55.157 --> 38:57.991
Melanie's mother passed
away a few years ago.

38:59.044 --> 39:01.962
Hey... um, excuse me.

39:02.014 --> 39:04.014
I'm headed to Callie's hearing.

39:04.049 --> 39:05.966
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

39:06.018 --> 39:07.134
- Take care of our boy.
- Yeah.

39:15.994 --> 39:17.127
All right, so...

39:27.222 --> 39:29.055
Hey.

39:31.193 --> 39:34.077
Hey, Stef. Okay, so I talked to Callie,

39:34.113 --> 39:35.996
got a general picture of what happened.

39:36.031 --> 39:38.165
- Okay, and you also read her police statement.
- Yes. Yeah, I did.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.083
Okay, I don't see how
that incriminates her.

39:40.119 --> 39:43.086
-Well, she admitted fault.
- Yeah, for getting in the car with Troy Johnson,

39:43.138 --> 39:44.921
not for causing the accident.

39:44.973 --> 39:46.256
That's how you and I read it.

39:46.308 --> 39:48.975
But any admission of guilt is
open to manipulation in court.

39:50.062 --> 39:51.144
Just listen, we're up first.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.029
For now, let's just... get her home.

39:53.065 --> 39:54.981
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

39:55.033 --> 39:58.902
All rise for the Honorable James Eskin.

40:03.125 --> 40:05.959
The court calls Callie Adams Foster.

40:06.044 --> 40:07.961
Okay, young lady.

40:07.963 --> 40:10.063
I see that you've been
before the court a few times.

40:10.098 --> 40:12.098
But let me refresh your memory.

40:12.100 --> 40:15.068
I'm to assume that the
petition against you is true,

40:15.103 --> 40:17.070
and determine the best
place for you to reside

40:17.105 --> 40:19.105
while awaiting your
jurisdictional hearing.

40:19.107 --> 40:20.106
Do you understand?

40:20.159 --> 40:21.158
Yes, sir.

40:21.193 --> 40:23.076
Your Honor, I'm representing Callie.

40:23.111 --> 40:26.112
- Uh, I'd first like to just...
- Let me save your breath and the court's time.

40:26.114 --> 40:27.651
You're going to argue that

40:27.652 --> 40:30.075
Ms. Adams Foster has a
stable, loving family.

40:30.118 --> 40:32.953
Her mom's a cop... etcetera, etcetera.

40:33.005 --> 40:36.957
And this guy, you're gonna argue
that she's a juvie frequent flyer,

40:36.959 --> 40:39.145
and that because she ran
away from this very stable,

40:39.146 --> 40:40.620
loving family once before,

40:40.963 --> 40:42.095
she's a flight risk.

40:42.130 --> 40:43.129
Does that about cover it?

40:43.131 --> 40:44.431
Yes, Your Honor.

40:44.466 --> 40:46.132
- That was before she was adopted...
- Kate, like I said...

40:46.185 --> 40:48.134
I have read her files.

40:48.187 --> 40:51.972
Now, I find the charges against
Ms. Adams Foster dubious,

40:52.024 --> 40:54.975
but we can't deny that she's run before.

40:54.977 --> 40:56.977
So, she'll await the
next hearing in juvie.

40:57.029 --> 40:59.112
- Anything else?
- Yes, Your Honor.

40:59.147 --> 41:01.982
Prior to a jurisdictional hearing,
we'd like to call a fitness hearing.

41:03.068 --> 41:04.067
Your Honor...

41:04.119 --> 41:05.952
They are within their right to do so.

41:05.988 --> 41:07.070
Schedule that with the registrar.

41:07.122 --> 41:08.905
Next case.

41:14.162 --> 41:15.996
What's a fitness hearing?

41:18.000 --> 41:19.916
It means they wanna try you as an adult.

41:21.053 --> 41:22.385
Okay, don't worry, don't worry.

41:23.972 --> 41:24.971
I love you, honey.
