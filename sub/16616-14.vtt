00:01.502 --> 00:04.838
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.922 --> 00:08.133
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.217 --> 00:11.386
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.970 --> 00:13.972
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.973 --> 00:17.601
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:21.063
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.647 --> 00:23.106
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:24.691
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.983 --> 00:29.905
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:36.245 --> 00:37.246
I gotta say,

00:37.329 --> 00:40.374
some days I wish I didn't have a sister.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.419
- What?
- Nothing.

00:44.503 --> 00:47.256
Oh, I thought you asked me
what was going on with my sister.

00:47.798 --> 00:48.841
I did not.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.677
Hey, look! Tom Tucker!

00:51.927 --> 00:53.178
<i>Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

00:53.262 --> 00:55.430
<i>Coming up, tonight's second story.</i>

00:55.514 --> 00:58.684
<i>But first,</i>
<i>Quahog says goodbye to an old friend.</i>

00:58.809 --> 01:00.811
<i>That's right, Tom.</i>
<i>Medieval Castle,</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:03.105
<i>which has been a staple</i>
<i>of family entertainment and dining,</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:04.481
<i>is closing its doors.</i>

01:04.565 --> 01:06.275
<i>The restaurant has gone into foreclosure</i>

01:06.358 --> 01:08.193
<i>and will be up for auction tomorrow.</i>

01:08.360 --> 01:10.571
<i>It's hard to believe</i>
<i>a place where you eat with your hands</i>

01:10.654 --> 01:12.239
<i>next to piles of horse dung</i>

01:12.322 --> 01:14.950
<i>while untrained theater students</i>
<i>fight with real swords</i>

01:15.033 --> 01:16.535
<i>could be drowning in lawsuits.</i>

01:16.702 --> 01:18.620
Medieval Castle? I love that place.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.789
My sister almost got a job there once.

01:20.873 --> 01:23.166
Guys, we should go
to that auction tomorrow and buy it.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.961
I mean, can you imagine if we had
our own medieval castle?

01:26.044 --> 01:28.505
I bet it'd be even more fun
than when I went to White Castle.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.969
Huh. Name's a little deceiving.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.980
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, it's my back. It's killing me.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.608
Yeah, I'm not falling for that
hot oil massage bit again.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.068
No, this time it's not a bit.
I'm really hurt.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.698
I must've jacked it up playing sports,
and not trying to dance like BeyoncÃ©.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.783
If you're in that much pain,
I better tell Lois.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.118
Please don't.

01:58.285 --> 02:01.580
Then she'll drive me to the doctor
and I hate being in the car with her.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.589
<i>Shut the door, baby</i>
<i>Don't say a word</i>

02:10.756 --> 02:13.133
Okay, I guess that's not my part.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.055
Here it is, guys.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.515
Oh, this is gonna be awesome!

02:19.598 --> 02:22.392
We just got to win this auction
and then we'll have our own castle.

02:22.518 --> 02:25.103
Oh, yeah? Over my dead tooth!

02:25.771 --> 02:27.856
Good afternoon and welcome
to today's auction.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.984
I'm Al Harrington of Al Harrington's
Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing

02:31.068 --> 02:32.778
Tubeman Warehouse and Emporium.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.948
Due to the presence of black mold,
discarded half-eaten turkey legs

02:36.031 --> 02:38.700
and an undulating rat king
that no one dares approach,

02:38.784 --> 02:41.036
I have been advised
to move these proceedings along

02:41.119 --> 02:42.371
as quickly as possible.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.373
Do I hear an opening bid? Anyone?

02:44.456 --> 02:48.001
Do I hear an opening bid for this
majestic fiberglass castle facade

02:48.085 --> 02:50.337
masking what was once
a Midas muffler shop?

02:50.587 --> 02:51.964
- Two bits.
- Two bits!

02:52.214 --> 02:54.091
That's 25 cents in the Old West.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.386
We have 25 cents.
Do I hear higher than 25 cents?

02:57.636 --> 03:00.681
This paper bag, which could be
full of money or my socks.

03:00.764 --> 03:01.890
You take the chance.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.725
We have an intriguing mystery bag!

03:03.809 --> 03:05.519
Do I hear more than the mystery bag?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.896
Two bits and a cardboard box!

03:07.980 --> 03:11.275
Which may or may
not contain a mystery bag.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.319
Already, the most challenging auction
I have ever been a part of!

03:14.403 --> 03:17.573
Do I hear a higher bid from that
James Bond villain over there?

03:18.282 --> 03:20.284
Fifty krone.

03:20.784 --> 03:24.121
Which, converted to
American currency, is $7.40!

03:24.204 --> 03:27.165
Do I hear a much higher bid
followed by shocked murmuring?

03:27.374 --> 03:29.793
-$10,000!

03:29.877 --> 03:30.919
I'm shocked.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.379
- That's shocking!
- We're all shocked!

03:32.671 --> 03:35.090
- We can't afford that.
- Peter, do something.

03:35.174 --> 03:38.552
I can't.
There's only $9,000 in the mystery bag.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.387
Due to my 12 noon court appointment

03:40.470 --> 03:42.389
as part of a crippling
child custody battle

03:42.472 --> 03:43.682
with my horrific ex-wife,

03:43.765 --> 03:46.018
I am saying, "Going once, going twice,"

03:46.101 --> 03:49.479
and awarding this condemned
building to you!

03:51.523 --> 03:52.733
Damn it, we lost.

03:52.816 --> 03:55.402
I guess the castle was a
crazy idea anyway.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.363
I should probably just invest
this money in a 401-gay.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.909
And how long before
I can take this out?

04:07.372 --> 04:09.666
Man, those losers
don't deserve that castle.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.837
I would call my sister about this
if she were able to answer the phone.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.297
Poor thing.

04:16.465 --> 04:17.549
Poor, poor thing.

04:17.633 --> 04:18.884
Well, you know,

04:18.967 --> 04:21.929
in castle times, if you wanted
something, you just took it.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.055
What are you talking about?

04:23.138 --> 04:25.557
I'm saying the four of us
should storm that castle

04:25.641 --> 04:27.059
and take it for ourselves.

04:27.142 --> 04:30.145
Should we do it with careful planning
or have another couple beers

04:30.229 --> 04:31.522
and then just go for it?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.899
Well, let's make that decision
after another couple beers.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.950
I checked with my mom
and she said it was cool with her

04:43.033 --> 04:45.077
if we wanted
to sleep here tonight.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.995
- I'm pretty sure I can.
- Count me in.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.498
Well, I'm gonna have to go home
and get my pillow.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.338
Yes, you heard me right.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.756
Cancel my insurance.

04:57.840 --> 05:02.386
I've been in this location for 40 years
and never once have I broken a lamp.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.720
Good day, sir.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.353
- God, I hope he's got insurance.
- Of course he's got insurance.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.522
He's been at this
location for 40 years.

05:16.608 --> 05:17.901
Yes, you heard me right.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.653
Cancel my husband's life insurance.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.864
He's been in perfect health
for 40 years.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.533
We're selling the lamp store
and going to travel.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.827
We need this after
losing both our children.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.120
Good day, sir.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.959
All right, Plan B.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.545
We'll shoot flaming
arrows like in <i>Robin Hood.</i>

05:36.879 --> 05:38.964
So, should I be aiming
for an open window

05:39.047 --> 05:40.716
or just arcing it over the wall?

05:40.799 --> 05:42.050
I don't know.
I've never seen the movie.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.385
Just the Bryan Adams video.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.970
Oh, such a good song.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.889
- Archers!
- Yeah?

05:47.472 --> 05:48.849
Oh, yeah.
He's that guy, too.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.475
Prepare to fire!

06:00.027 --> 06:01.486
I wonder what they're gonna put here.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.654
Trader Joe's?

06:02.738 --> 06:04.740
Oh, I would love a Trader Joe's.

06:09.912 --> 06:10.913
Sorry to keep you.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.498
I was reading this <i>Highlights</i>
magazine in the waiting room.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.751
You see any differences
between these two pictures?

06:16.043 --> 06:19.546
Oh, the pie has a wedge removed.
Yes. Yes.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.716
Dr. Hartman, were you able to tell
anything from Stewie's X-rays?

06:22.799 --> 06:25.344
Oh, yeah. Little guy's got scoliosis.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.595
Oh, my God!

06:26.762 --> 06:29.681
Oh, no! Am I gonna be a big shoe,
small shoe guy?

06:29.806 --> 06:31.308
But don't worry, he'll be fine.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.936
He just needs to wear
this brace for a while to correct it.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.145
Oh, dear.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.397
Now, does he have
any school pictures coming up?

06:37.481 --> 06:38.899
Yeah, he actually does.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.985
Well, then, this will not
be a refrigerator door year.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.575
All right,
this says if we don't get arrested

06:48.659 --> 06:49.868
for the next six months,

06:49.952 --> 06:52.371
the arson and mayhem
charges will be dropped.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.956
Hey, sorry again, you guys.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.750
- Ah, no harm done.
- Yeah, no hard feelings, fellas.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.335
I've already forgotten about it.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.754
I'm too busy thinking
about my hot date tonight.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.422
Yeah, right. Hot date.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.216
With your left hand
or your right hand?

07:04.299 --> 07:07.261
Well, actually, I use both
and do like an Indian burn.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.929
But that's not what this is.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.556
Tonight, I'm getting lucky.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.099
Hi, are you Mort?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.851
Why, yes, I am.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.145
What the hell was that?

07:17.229 --> 07:18.522
Mort's getting laid?

07:18.605 --> 07:22.192
Yeah, thanks to Tinder, he's had a
different girl every night this week.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.611
- What's Tinder?
- It's an app for your phone

07:24.695 --> 07:28.407
where two strangers
can hook up for a dirty liaison.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.658
- What, like hookers?
- No.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.451
Just two horny people with phones.

07:31.535 --> 07:32.744
Wait. I don't get it.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.080
So, you hit 'em on the head
with your phone and knock 'em out?

07:35.163 --> 07:38.125
No, you just swipe someone's picture,
they come over and you plow 'em.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.335
Wow! I gotta try this.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.337
I mean, easy sex on the Internet?

07:42.421 --> 07:45.465
- Did you know about this, Scott Baio?
- Uh, yeah.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.884
And you, Scott Caan?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.969
Did you also know
about easy sex on the Internet?

07:49.052 --> 07:50.137
Yes.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.473
And how about you,
douchebag music producer, Scott Storch?

07:53.557 --> 07:56.059
Quagmire,
all the Scotts know about it.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.651
Okay, let's get me set up
on this Tinder thing.

08:04.735 --> 08:07.154
I can't wait to start getting laid
at the push of a button.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.072
Well, first you gotta set up your profile.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.616
Oh, yeah, I've been working on that.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.660
I wrote several long
paragraphs describing my interests,

08:13.744 --> 08:17.497
some pet peeves, choice of wine,
couple of inspirational quotes,

08:17.581 --> 08:18.957
things I've learned from my cats.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.417
No, no, no, no, none of that.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.002
You want a naked bathroom selfie,

08:22.085 --> 08:25.088
covering your stuff
with a fistful of $100 bills.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.509
That shows you like sex
and you got money.

08:28.675 --> 08:29.927
Well, that seems a bit crude.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.929
- Oh, she's cute.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.515
And wearing a yin-yang necklace.
That's interesting.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.017
- Wonder what beach that is.
- Oh, no, no, gimme that.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.727
Here, you see this?
You see what I'm doing?

08:38.810 --> 08:41.647
Not even looking.
I'm swiping "Yes. Yes, yes, yes."

08:41.772 --> 08:42.940
Casting a wide net.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.400
- Look at this. You already got a hit.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.236
- And she sent a message.
- She did?

08:48.070 --> 08:51.073
What am I looking at here?
It's mostly small, colorful pictures.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.075
Those are emojis. Read 'em.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.911
Okay, it says "Hey"
and then a kissy face

08:55.994 --> 08:59.957
and then like a saucy, smirking face,
three balloons and a locomotive.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.124
What the hell is all this?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.627
It means she likes you.
Send something back.

09:03.794 --> 09:07.464
Okay. "Dearest Teresa,
I hope this finds you well.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.925
"I so appreciated
your last communication."

09:10.008 --> 09:11.969
No, stop! Stop! God, stop! Stop!

09:12.052 --> 09:14.972
Just send her an eggplant
and the erupting volcano.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.690
All right, take a gander.
Gawk at the Elephant Man.

09:24.773 --> 09:25.858
Let's get it all out.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.068
There's our brave guy.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.821
- Brave?
- And just for being such a trouper,

09:30.904 --> 09:34.324
I thought maybe you could be
the first in line for snack today.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.493
Really? On pretzel day?

09:36.577 --> 09:39.663
And after that,
you can hold the bunny.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.583
Yeah, I'll pass on that but the pretzel
thing sounds up my alley.

09:42.666 --> 09:46.461
Now, if I could just find someone
to wear this hero hat.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.964
I think I found him.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.759
Well, I say,
that was a pleasant surprise.

09:52.843 --> 09:53.969
You know, like, when a woman

09:54.052 --> 09:56.471
in a Porsche Cayenne
isn't a complete bitch.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.935
Huh. Whoa, I did not expect that.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.899
I wasn't telling you to go.
I was trying to smell my own fart.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.699
Hi, are you Courtney from Tinder?

10:15.782 --> 10:17.618
- You must be Glenn.
- I got you these.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.536
A lovely bouquet for a lovely...

10:19.620 --> 10:21.747
Yeah, take off your pants
and sit on the coffee table.

10:21.830 --> 10:22.956
Okay.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.501
That was great.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.252
And we can still
make our reservation.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.713
What? Why? We already had sex.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.633
Wait, so I don't have
to make small talk with you

10:32.716 --> 10:34.676
- or spend any money?
- Of course not.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.471
Here, wipe yourself off
with this West Elm catalog.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.349
My God! This app is amazing!

10:40.432 --> 10:42.351
Thank you, cellphone Jesus.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.062
Huh?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.688
Oh, yeah. Fine.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.446
<i>Oh, feeling crazy</i>

10:55.447 --> 10:58.700
<i>The moon is up, the night is hazy</i>

10:59.493 --> 11:02.996
<i>Let's get lost in the shadows</i>

11:03.872 --> 11:07.251
<i>Somewhere we can go</i>
<i>where no one else can find</i>

11:08.669 --> 11:10.504
<i>Loosen up your body till you come undone</i>

11:10.754 --> 11:12.631
<i>Loosen up your body till you come undone</i>

11:13.048 --> 11:16.343
<i>Oh, my, my</i>
<i>Looking like a good good time</i>

11:17.177 --> 11:20.973
<i>Don't disguise</i>
<i>the way you wanna love tonight</i>

11:21.431 --> 11:25.102
<i>Oh, my, my</i>
<i>Hook you with a brand new high</i>

11:25.602 --> 11:27.145
<i>Don't be shy</i>

11:27.604 --> 11:31.525
<i>I just wanna live tonight</i>
<i>Have a little F.U.N</i>

11:36.822 --> 11:39.741
So, how's it going with the back brace?
People giving you a hard time?

11:39.825 --> 11:41.243
Quite the contrary, Brian.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.495
Apparently, people love the wretched.

11:43.579 --> 11:45.205
Thanks to this thing,
I was offered seats

11:45.289 --> 11:47.749
directly behind home plate at Fenway.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.085
I passed.

11:50.836 --> 11:53.922
Wow, that patient next door is fat.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.257
I can hear you!

11:55.340 --> 11:57.551
Uh, that wasn't me,
that was Mrs. Griffin.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.511
So, I've got Stewie's results here.

11:59.595 --> 12:02.848
Um, it appears the back brace
has corrected the spine very nicely.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.934
That's wonderful. Stewie doesn't
have to wear the brace anymore.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.395
What? No, I can't give this thing up.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.898
What do you mean?
You wanna keep wearing the brace?

12:10.981 --> 12:13.609
Of course I do. It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

12:13.692 --> 12:17.070
When I wear this brace, I get pampered
like the Queen of England.

12:17.154 --> 12:20.908
So, I have the most
money in the world, right?

12:20.991 --> 12:22.201
Yes, Your Majesty.

12:22.284 --> 12:27.915
Great! Can you make sure my hair
looks like anyone in a nursing home?

12:36.757 --> 12:38.509
All right! Hittin' the links.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.136
Joe, golf shorts may
not be the right look for you.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.972
- It's gonna be a nice day.
- Not for us if you wear those.

12:44.056 --> 12:45.599
Well, that seems a little hurtful.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.393
Hey, where's Quagmire?
Our tee time's in 20 minutes.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.314
I don't know. I haven't seen much
of him since he discovered Tinder.

12:56.735 --> 12:57.861
Tinder?

13:05.494 --> 13:07.120
Quagmire, come on. It's time for golf.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.248
I swipe "No" on golf.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.875
Smells kinda gamey in here.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.795
Swipe "Yes" on Betsy.
Swipe "Yes" on Jennifer.

13:14.878 --> 13:18.131
Swipe "Yes" on Andrea.
Swipe "Yes" on all the lady faces.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.717
Swipe, swipe, swipe,
swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.720
Let's, uh... Let's get a little
light in here, huh, buddy?

13:23.887 --> 13:27.140
The yellow face!
It burns my Tinder!

13:27.558 --> 13:29.434
Oh, my God. He's lost it.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.604
That app's turned Quagmire
into some kind of sex ghoul.

13:33.397 --> 13:36.567
The way he's crouching,
there's a teste peeking out.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.993
Hey, listen. Quagmire,
you're our friend, all right.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.286
We hate to
see you like this.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.829
I don't have any friends.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.081
Only sex people from the phone.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.835
You gotta stop this. It looks like
you haven't left this room in weeks.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.379
No need to leave.
They all come here.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.048
Sometimes they bring
burgers and cheese.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.426
Hey, come on, Quagmire.
Let's go for a walk, huh?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.428
Get some fresh air.
Oh, for God's sake.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.597
You're gonna have
a baby in your butt, man.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.392
Can't leave.
"Heather within five miles" is coming.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.730
Are you "Glenn within five miles"?

14:14.938 --> 14:18.692
I can take my glass eye out
if you wanna try something different.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.652
I got a good feeling about her.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.154
Maybe she's the one.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.864
Let's do it in the garage.

14:23.947 --> 14:27.201
It's kinda cold but we can do
sweaters on, pants off.

14:28.577 --> 14:29.912
Look, he left his phone!

14:29.995 --> 14:33.248
I'm just gonna nudge it with
my knee into this empty pizza box.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.710
And it's stuck to my knee.
Let's, uh... Let's just go.

14:38.962 --> 14:42.633
All right. We gotta just throw that phone
away and end this once and for all.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.302
Yeah, no kidding.
Quagmire's in bad shape.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.222
He looks worse than I did
after that day at the beach.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.851
I spanked somebody else's kid.

15:01.276 --> 15:04.238
- Sorry I was late.
- You're still wearing that back brace?

15:04.321 --> 15:07.115
That can't be good for you. Dr. Hartman
said you were done with that thing.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.826
I'm not gonna listen to that bozo.
Of course I'm still wearing it.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.453
Watch me jump this line.

15:11.870 --> 15:15.082
Excuse me, I have scoliosis.
Excuse me, scoliosis coming through.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.668
Hey, pal. Polio.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.003
A thousand apologies.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.970
Swipe, swipe, swipe.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.638
Come on, I'm not getting any matches!

15:29.721 --> 15:31.390
All right, Quagmire, we gotta talk.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.684
This whole thing's
out of control, Quagmire.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.060
You gotta get off Tinder.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.938
Yeah, there's plenty of nice women
out in the real world

15:38.021 --> 15:39.731
to meet the old-fashioned way.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.484
And on top of that,
Tinder makes you gross.

15:43.610 --> 15:47.197
<i>There was a time</i>
<i>when you'd be more selective</i>

15:47.281 --> 15:50.617
<i>When you were horny</i>
<i>and feeling erective</i>

15:50.951 --> 15:54.121
<i>Now one swipe</i>
<i>and there's thousands to bone</i>

15:54.454 --> 15:57.541
<i>All from a sex app</i>
<i>you use on your phone</i>

15:57.624 --> 15:58.834
<i>That's the Tinder</i>

16:00.460 --> 16:03.755
<i>A lot of sad lonely gals</i>
<i>who want babies</i>

16:03.922 --> 16:07.092
<i>Three-hundred pounders</i>
<i>infested with scabies</i>

16:07.801 --> 16:11.054
<i>Leather gimps who do</i>
<i>nothing but moan</i>

16:11.138 --> 16:14.141
<i>These are the weirdos</i>
<i>you find on your phone</i>

16:14.308 --> 16:16.810
You know, a surprising number
of them live near the airport.

16:17.102 --> 16:20.606
<i>Gonorrhea, HPV, ah</i>

16:21.106 --> 16:24.401
<i>You will catch a dose</i>

16:24.484 --> 16:28.238
<i>Of blisters and itching</i>
<i>and genital warts</i>

16:28.322 --> 16:31.825
<i>'Cause Tinder makes you so gross</i>

16:34.036 --> 16:37.581
<i>And for kids it's kind of tragic</i>
<i>Sex for them has lost its magic</i>

16:37.664 --> 16:41.460
<i>Bangin' every Tom and Dick</i>
<i>and Jack and Jill and Joan</i>

16:41.668 --> 16:43.212
<i>And this also might surprise you</i>

16:43.295 --> 16:45.005
<i>All your married friends despise you</i>

16:45.088 --> 16:48.509
<i>'Cause we're not allowed to have</i>
<i>an orgy through our phone</i>

16:50.135 --> 16:51.929
<i>You're perverted</i>

16:52.012 --> 16:53.597
<i>Barely human</i>

16:54.348 --> 16:57.893
<i>You're not even close</i>

16:58.018 --> 17:01.563
<i>A filthy degenerate</i>
<i>seeking a thrill</i>

17:01.647 --> 17:05.234
<i>Your spirits and genitals</i>
<i>run through the mill</i>

17:05.317 --> 17:08.820
<i>With plenty of hoes</i>
<i>and prescriptions to fill</i>

17:09.029 --> 17:15.786
<i>'Cause Tinder makes you so gross</i>

17:18.872 --> 17:21.667
You guys can just forget it.
I'm not quitting Tinder.

17:23.377 --> 17:25.712
Guys, I've been to the doctor's.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.923
I do have a baby in my butt.

17:36.807 --> 17:38.976
Mmm, you're still here.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.811
Did we...

17:41.895 --> 17:43.897
What the deuce?

17:46.483 --> 17:48.819
Brian! Brian!

17:48.944 --> 17:53.323
Yes, is it possible to get Showtime
for free for the next, like, two hours

17:53.407 --> 17:54.992
- to see if I like it?
- Brian!

17:59.079 --> 18:00.956
What is this?
What's happening to me?

18:01.039 --> 18:02.541
Oh, my God! Stewie!

18:02.624 --> 18:05.085
It's gotta be from wearing
that damn brace all the time.

18:05.169 --> 18:08.422
Your neck must've atrophied so much
it can no longer support your head.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.090
You've gotta take me to the hospital!

18:10.174 --> 18:12.342
Absolutely! Let me just
watch <i>Jennifer's Body</i>

18:12.426 --> 18:13.468
and we'll go right there.

18:13.552 --> 18:16.180
Brian, there's no nudity in
that movie. Take me to the hospital!

18:16.263 --> 18:18.390
What, so it's rated R for curses?

18:18.473 --> 18:19.766
God, this country.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.565
Is it... Is it noticeable?

18:26.648 --> 18:27.774
Nothing that can't be fixed

18:27.858 --> 18:29.818
with a string of chili pepper
Christmas lights.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.864
<i>I wore that brace for</i>
<i>the next five years of my life.</i>

18:33.947 --> 18:36.241
<i>The kids stopped cheering</i>
<i>the second day.</i>

18:36.325 --> 18:39.745
<i>Then it was just, "Get off the swing,</i>
<i>you Christmas turd."</i>

18:45.459 --> 18:47.127
I'll have another one, Jerome.

18:47.211 --> 18:48.879
You sure you haven't had too many?

18:48.962 --> 18:50.088
Just gimme a drink!

18:52.633 --> 18:54.635
Sir, is everything all right?

18:54.718 --> 18:57.095
I'm fine! I'm fine! Oh, hey.

18:57.179 --> 19:00.140
- Are you on Tinder?
- What? That gross dating thing?

19:00.224 --> 19:02.684
No.
Look, I'm not trying to pick you up.

19:02.768 --> 19:05.312
It just seemed like
you were upset about something.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.398
And I know when I'm upset,
it's nice to let someone else in.

19:08.482 --> 19:09.650
Giggity.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.901
What did you just say?

19:10.984 --> 19:13.654
I don't know.
I think I said... I said "Giggity."

19:13.820 --> 19:15.155
Okay...

19:16.240 --> 19:19.159
Come on, Quagmire.
This is a real girl right in front of you.

19:19.243 --> 19:21.912
Just pick her up and take her home.
You don't need your phone.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.748
Don't listen to him.
I'm all you need.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.084
Are you really gonna
listen to a phone over me?

19:27.167 --> 19:29.211
God, I don't know why
I do this anymore!

19:29.294 --> 19:31.088
Don't give up, miniature Quagmire.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.424
This is exactly why you got into
the over-the-shoulder advice business.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.260
Ignore him, miniature Quagmire!

19:36.343 --> 19:38.554
Give up on your attempt
to convince real Quagmire

19:38.637 --> 19:40.764
to not use Tinder and to instead have sex

19:40.848 --> 19:42.099
with this woman who's
right in front of him.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.767
- Wait, what's going on?
- I'm just saying,

19:43.851 --> 19:46.103
you used to have skills
that no one else had.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.856
That took you years to hone.
You were an artist.

19:48.939 --> 19:50.566
Ah, damn, I think I was too wordy.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.902
I'm still an artist.

19:54.486 --> 19:55.696
What was that?

19:55.946 --> 19:59.408
I was just saying,
I am upset about something.

19:59.533 --> 20:02.160
I thought you were.
Do you wanna talk about it?

20:02.327 --> 20:05.914
I do. I buried my twin brother today.

20:06.290 --> 20:09.209
We were very close.
We used to finish each other's...

20:09.626 --> 20:10.627
Um...

20:11.545 --> 20:13.005
Sentences?

20:13.088 --> 20:15.007
Oh, oh, I just got chills.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.551
- I'm Sandra.
- I'm Glenn.

20:18.385 --> 20:22.389
You know, I just... I just feel like
my penis shouldn't be alone tonight.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.559
All right!

20:26.393 --> 20:28.478
Well, looks like Quagmire's back.

20:28.562 --> 20:31.398
Yep. He's scumming it up
in the real world again.

20:31.481 --> 20:35.652
And all it took was for us to hire
that $200 dirty prostitute

20:35.736 --> 20:37.821
to pretend to be a nice lady in a bar.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.740
I'm just glad she's a prostitute

20:39.823 --> 20:43.035
and not that lady murderer
that's been all over the news.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.580
Hi, I'm that prostitute
you guys hired to seduce your friend.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.082
Oh, boy. Well, deal's off. He's dead.

20:49.333 --> 20:52.294
But perhaps we can
make other arrangements.

20:57.341 --> 20:59.510
Hey, do you think
I could try to kick one?

20:59.593 --> 21:01.720
No, you're all-time goalie!
