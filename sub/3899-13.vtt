[Big Boo] Sit, sit, sit.

01:29.663 --> 01:31.165
We don't give a shit about the movie.

01:31.248 --> 01:33.333
My heart is beating so fast right now.

01:33.417 --> 01:36.336
Bony, rat-faced son of a bitch
deserved to grow an ass tulip.

01:36.420 --> 01:37.671
What in the fuck is wrong with us?

01:37.754 --> 01:39.506
We ain't rapey enough.

01:39.589 --> 01:41.675
I mean, I sure as hell
don't wanna keep staring down that

01:41.758 --> 01:45.387
naked, hairy butthole and
trying to pull apart them sticky cheeks.

01:45.470 --> 01:49.683
Do you think that he agonized
over this like some little bitch?

01:50.559 --> 01:53.562
No. He planned his rape,
and he raped his plan.

01:53.645 --> 01:55.105
He didn't plan it.

01:55.189 --> 01:59.193
At least not the first time.
How do I know that he didn't feel bad?

01:59.276 --> 02:02.487
I mean, after he came?
He could actually hate himself.

02:02.571 --> 02:04.531
Well, he fucking should.
He's a rapist.

02:04.614 --> 02:05.740
Well, then maybe it's good

02:05.824 --> 02:09.244
that we didn't shove a carrot
down his rabbit hole,

02:09.328 --> 02:12.331
'cause we could be sitting here,
hating on ourselves too, Boo.

02:12.414 --> 02:14.124
Face it...

02:14.208 --> 02:17.544
we ain't Swedish enough
to be splitting his starfish.

02:18.628 --> 02:21.215
And I ain't a rapist.
I ain't, and I feel good about it.

02:21.298 --> 02:25.427
Well, I hope that is a consolation
tomorrow when you have van duty.

02:26.386 --> 02:27.387
Shit.

02:27.471 --> 02:28.930
Oh.

02:29.013 --> 02:33.310
Maybe I'll drink that Mexican diarrhea tea
that the fat chicolos make,

02:33.393 --> 02:34.644
and I'll be too sick to work.

02:34.728 --> 02:37.189
Yeah, that's great,
but what about the next day,

02:37.272 --> 02:39.191
and the day after that and the next?

02:39.899 --> 02:42.944
He's got you.
God, there's no fucking justice!

02:43.027 --> 02:45.364
Yeah, and I really don't like tea.

02:54.789 --> 02:55.832
Hmm?

02:55.915 --> 02:58.543
-I'm freaking the fuck out.
-Relax, I'll catch you up.

02:58.627 --> 03:01.171
See, she's uptight, right,
and he's this unpredictable sous chef--

03:01.255 --> 03:04.007
No, Soso is dead in the library.

03:05.175 --> 03:08.595
For real, I think.
Look, I walked in...

03:08.678 --> 03:10.096
Go find a CO.

03:10.180 --> 03:11.306
No, I wanna see.
Where is she?

03:11.390 --> 03:12.766
Will you please just come?

03:12.849 --> 03:14.226
Can we see?

03:14.309 --> 03:16.936
Oh, please, please, please, please,
with extra sugar on top.

03:17.020 --> 03:18.230
-Please, please...
-Okay.

03:18.313 --> 03:20.982
You save our seats,
and tell me everything I miss.

03:21.065 --> 03:22.192
Fine.

03:23.860 --> 03:27.572
[Crazy Eyes] Dead bodies. Dead bodies,
dead bodies, dead bodies, dead bodies.

03:27.656 --> 03:28.907
Come on.

03:43.130 --> 03:44.589
[blows air]

03:45.632 --> 03:47.342
-She ain't dead.
-She ain't?

03:47.426 --> 03:49.386
I done seen enough dead to know alive.

03:49.469 --> 03:51.095
-[sighs]
-[groans]

03:57.227 --> 03:58.353
Here.

04:00.855 --> 04:02.816
What we gonna do with her?

04:02.899 --> 04:05.610
If only we had an invisibility cloak.

04:05.694 --> 04:08.988
Or an extremely deep
and wide belly button.

04:09.072 --> 04:10.157
Stop it.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.242
Man, we need to make sure
the girl don't go to Psych.

04:12.326 --> 04:16.663
No. Like, N-O, no.
Psych's so bad.

04:16.745 --> 04:18.582
I wouldn't even wish it
on the people running it.

04:18.665 --> 04:20.959
Although that would be
poetic in its own way.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.043
On my count, all right?

04:22.125 --> 04:24.879
One, two... [grunts]

04:24.963 --> 04:26.340
Watch her head, watch her head.

04:26.423 --> 04:27.507
[Crazy Eyes] Got it. Got it. I got it.

04:27.591 --> 04:29.843
[Taystee] All right, you get the front.
I got the back.

04:29.926 --> 04:31.595
[piano music plays]

04:41.145 --> 04:43.315
[Brook's mom] Three, four, and wrong!

04:48.612 --> 04:49.613
Well?

04:49.696 --> 04:55.034
I skipped the final repetition
and played directly into the coda.

04:55.118 --> 04:56.536
You thought I wouldn't notice?

04:57.454 --> 04:59.122
Do you know what happens to cheaters?

04:59.914 --> 05:00.957
They go to hell.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.126
Who told you that?

05:04.794 --> 05:05.837
Brook!

05:07.256 --> 05:08.673
Reverend Pat Roberts.

05:09.799 --> 05:12.219
I didn't watch TV on purpose.

05:12.302 --> 05:15.305
Jessica's parents always have
The 700 Club on.

05:15.389 --> 05:18.767
And that's why Jessica
never places at the science fair.

05:20.143 --> 05:22.646
There is no hell.
There is no heaven.

05:22.729 --> 05:27.108
When we die, all that remains are
the memories of our achievements.

05:27.191 --> 05:31.571
And cheaters are very quickly forgotten.

05:31.655 --> 05:33.407
Again.

05:35.241 --> 05:37.411
Play. And sit up straight!

05:39.871 --> 05:42.206
Hey. You have a nice day?

05:43.249 --> 05:44.543
We went to Olive Garden.

05:44.626 --> 05:47.128
Well, I had a good day, too.
Helped some inmates.

05:47.211 --> 05:49.548
Your Russian friend?

05:49.631 --> 05:51.341
Yeah, and an Asian girl.

05:52.258 --> 05:55.470
Had a case of jailbird blues.
Hey...

05:57.180 --> 06:00.350
did you ever consider
that you're technically Asian?

06:00.434 --> 06:03.227
Round-eyed Asian with blond hair?

06:03.312 --> 06:04.563
I'm Ukrainian.

06:06.356 --> 06:08.400
I'm making a joke.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.447
[objects clatter]

06:15.198 --> 06:18.577
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to smile once in a while.

06:20.244 --> 06:22.872
It's not like I'm asking you
to sleep in my bed...

06:23.998 --> 06:27.126
or bring me back leftovers
of Lasagna Classico...

06:28.753 --> 06:30.797
which you pay for with my money,

06:30.880 --> 06:34.718
which you know I enjoy,
which you never finish!

06:42.642 --> 06:44.936
[speaking English] You know what?
I had a really good day today.

06:45.019 --> 06:47.271
I had a really good day today.

06:48.523 --> 06:51.860
And I just wanted to come home
and share it with you...

06:51.943 --> 06:53.362
and you don't care.

06:53.445 --> 06:54.696
At all!

06:56.990 --> 07:00.284
[speaking Russian]
What do you really want from me?

07:01.202 --> 07:02.621
My freedom.

07:11.713 --> 07:15.133
[speaking English] I think you and
your mother ought to go get an apartment.

07:15.216 --> 07:18.052
-I'll help you pay for it.
-You would do that?

07:20.889 --> 07:24.100
I'm surrounded by women
in captivity all day long.

07:25.352 --> 07:29.230
I don't need to come home to another one
who feels like she's trapped in a cage.

07:39.991 --> 07:42.326
Well, what you waiting for?

07:42.411 --> 07:44.538
Why don't you...
put your fingers down her throat?

07:44.621 --> 07:48.041
Knowing what to do does not make me
bottom bitch of the vomitorium.

07:48.124 --> 07:50.377
Maybe stick your fingers
down your own throat.

07:50.460 --> 07:54.130
People see or hear other people puke,
makes them wanna do it.

07:54.213 --> 07:55.757
-Sympathetic vomiting.
-[scoffs]

07:55.840 --> 07:57.801
Just... Fine, we wasting time.

07:57.884 --> 08:00.219
-Just fuck it.
-No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:03.014 --> 08:04.057
Ew.

08:04.140 --> 08:05.392
-Easier cleanup.
-Yeah.

08:05.475 --> 08:06.976
Okay. Good. Go.

08:10.188 --> 08:11.606
Okay.

08:14.192 --> 08:15.234
[retching]

08:15.318 --> 08:16.360
[Crazy Eyes] Yes.

08:17.987 --> 08:20.323
-Oh, Jesus!
-[Crazy Eyes laughing]

08:20.407 --> 08:21.741
[Taystee] Ew!

08:22.659 --> 08:24.368
Chunks! That's nasty!

08:24.453 --> 08:27.581
Hmm, but look at all them pills.

08:27.664 --> 08:28.998
Sympathetic vomiting.

08:29.082 --> 08:30.166
[gagging]

08:30.249 --> 08:31.626
Pull the drain.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.001
[Poussey retching]

08:34.212 --> 08:37.506
Now, should we stick a needle
in her heart or something?

08:37.591 --> 08:41.344
This ain't Pulp Fiction,
and that ain't heroin.

08:41.428 --> 08:42.554
Well, why ain't she awake?

08:42.636 --> 08:45.139
'Cause she ate fistfuls of pills
like they was Tic Tacs

08:45.223 --> 08:47.767
-and she weighs three pounds.
-Good point.

08:47.851 --> 08:50.144
We gotta watch her and make
sure she doesn't stop breathing,

08:50.228 --> 08:52.313
and if she does, we give her CPR.

08:52.396 --> 08:53.482
[Poussey] Shit.

08:53.565 --> 08:57.401
Look, if that happens, man, you giving her
the mouth-to-throw-up-mouth, all right?

08:58.361 --> 08:59.403
She okay?

09:00.196 --> 09:02.866
There's no blood in it, so that's good.

09:03.492 --> 09:04.868
-Huh.
-[clicks tongue]

09:04.951 --> 09:07.036
She'll be fine.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.413
Man, why this shit
gotta happen on movie night?

09:09.498 --> 09:10.999
Anybody want some cigarettes?

09:12.584 --> 09:15.128
I found these hanging from the drain.

09:17.046 --> 09:19.466
Relax. We go in,
we make our case.

09:19.549 --> 09:22.844
Uh-uh. With Dad, we go in with one agenda,

09:22.927 --> 09:25.263
we come out excited
to do the exact opposite.

09:25.346 --> 09:28.432
He's like a magical, manipulative wizard.

09:28.517 --> 09:31.185
There is no way either of us
are gonna walk out of there

09:31.269 --> 09:35.649
thinking it's okay
to punish the victim of a hate crime.

09:35.732 --> 09:38.568
"Burset comes out of the SHU."
That's our mantra.

09:38.652 --> 09:40.194
-"Burset comes out of the SHU."
-There you go.

09:40.278 --> 09:42.572
-Yeah. "Burset comes out of the SHU."
-"Burset comes out of the SHU."

09:42.656 --> 09:45.324
Well, why don't we just drive back there
and let her out ourselves?

09:45.408 --> 09:48.662
Okay, suppose we do that.
Then what happens?

09:48.745 --> 09:50.121
We probably get fired.

09:50.204 --> 09:52.415
That's right. And then what?

09:52.499 --> 09:54.083
She gets thrown back in.

09:54.167 --> 09:56.670
But this time,
there's no one around to help her.

09:56.753 --> 09:58.963
They'll bury her in there.
You know that.

09:59.047 --> 10:02.175
-Let's do this right.
-You're walking into the lion's den.

10:02.258 --> 10:03.968
I'm with a guy named Daniel.

10:04.052 --> 10:06.304
[chuckles] No one calls me that.

10:06.387 --> 10:09.516
And "Danny in the Lion's Den"
sounds like the name of a picture book

10:09.599 --> 10:11.518
for slow, homeschooled kids.

10:11.601 --> 10:12.727
[snickering]

10:12.811 --> 10:15.605
-Joe, he's my dad.
-And he's wrong.

10:15.689 --> 10:17.774
You need to stand up to him,
tell him that.

10:17.857 --> 10:19.901
-He's gonna respect you for it.
-[sighs]

10:19.984 --> 10:22.028
And if he doesn't, he's your dad,
he's still gonna love you.

10:22.111 --> 10:25.949
Man, you know nothing about WASPs.

10:30.119 --> 10:33.122
Maybe you need to bust out
the eggs again, like in the old days.

10:33.206 --> 10:34.457
Norma doesn't need that voodoo shit.

10:34.541 --> 10:36.710
[Gina] Well, maybe she does.
I mean, no offense, Norma,

10:36.793 --> 10:39.921
but your latest gift seems to be
making your flock disappear.

10:40.004 --> 10:43.007
Those quitters aren't Norma's sheep.
They're rats.

10:43.091 --> 10:45.301
Don't rats leave the sinking ship first?

10:45.384 --> 10:47.887
Shut up, Angie.
It's your fault everybody bailed.

10:47.971 --> 10:49.138
What did Angie do?

10:49.222 --> 10:52.726
I ruined my miracle by
getting thrown in the SHU.

10:53.517 --> 10:56.104
Which was seriously the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

10:56.187 --> 10:59.983
Even counting that time I smoked crack
thinking it was meth

11:00.066 --> 11:02.986
and then took four shots of Everclear
and ate cat poop.

11:04.028 --> 11:07.741
[stammers] Maybe those quitter,
rat-sheep girls are a little right.

11:07.824 --> 11:10.827
Like, if it was a miracle,
shouldn't she be in France

11:10.910 --> 11:14.455
-or Albuquerque or something?
-[sighs]

11:14.538 --> 11:18.209
I'm sorry, Holy Norma.
I didn't mean to mess it up.

11:18.292 --> 11:19.460
[inhales sharply]

11:19.543 --> 11:22.546
You'll go back to making people cry,
but in a good way, really soon.

11:22.631 --> 11:23.632
[sighs]

11:24.841 --> 11:25.842
[whispers] Get out.

11:25.925 --> 11:27.218
[sighs]

11:35.226 --> 11:36.477
[Leanne sighs]

11:36.560 --> 11:38.271
I heard a rumor we're getting new beds.

11:39.522 --> 11:41.858
Did your spirit friends
have anything to do with that?

11:43.943 --> 11:48.031
[sighs] Look,
people love a sign, you know?

11:49.115 --> 11:51.660
We're all looking for a clue
that there's a reason for things,

11:51.743 --> 11:55.872
that everything's not all
random and lonely, you know?

11:55.955 --> 12:00.459
Maybe focus on another miracle...
one some dummy can't fuck up.

12:07.759 --> 12:09.427
What do you want, Gonzales?

12:09.510 --> 12:10.553
[sighs]

12:10.636 --> 12:13.181
Straight-up gangsta, Chapman.
Respect.

12:13.264 --> 12:17.018
-I'm not the Godfather.
-No. You're taller and tighter.

12:18.144 --> 12:19.353
It was business.

12:19.437 --> 12:21.272
So what's it gonna take
for me to get back in?

12:21.355 --> 12:22.816
Have you actually seen The Godfather?

12:22.899 --> 12:26.235
You're the sour-pantied Luca Brasi.

12:26.319 --> 12:27.779
You sleep with the fishes.

12:27.862 --> 12:30.489
-I can help.
-You're dead to me.

12:30.573 --> 12:31.615
Basta.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.534
Oh, come on, my mom is sick.

12:33.617 --> 12:35.203
Really? Is that the best
that you can come up with?

12:35.286 --> 12:37.831
No! For real.

12:39.082 --> 12:40.333
She's got lymphoma,

12:40.416 --> 12:43.795
and the co-pays and shit
are killing her faster than the cancer.

12:43.878 --> 12:45.421
[sighs]

12:45.504 --> 12:47.298
I gotta be able to help her.

12:47.381 --> 12:51.845
But instead, I'm stuck in this shithole,
barely making enough to pay for Pantene.

12:53.346 --> 12:54.347
I'm sorry.

12:54.430 --> 12:58.601
Come on, Chapman, please.
I know you're a good person.

12:58.684 --> 13:01.312
And think of all that
sweet potorro tang I'm wasting.

13:01.395 --> 13:05.649
I'm begging and I don't do that
'cause I got Latin pride and shit.

13:05.734 --> 13:10.196
But I'm begging you for this,
'cause it's real stuff going on.

13:12.741 --> 13:15.201
You start off at a lower rate
than everybody else.

13:15.284 --> 13:16.285
Thank you.

13:16.369 --> 13:18.621
-Thank you...
-No hugging. Mmm-mmm.

13:19.956 --> 13:20.957
[sighs]

13:26.004 --> 13:27.046
It's none of my business,

13:27.130 --> 13:30.674
but you know that teardrop
under her eye isn't real, right?

13:30.759 --> 13:33.970
You're right.
It's literally none of your business.

13:34.053 --> 13:36.765
It's my business, and it's flourishing.

13:36.848 --> 13:40.309
How do you think that's gonna look?
Bringing back the agitator-in-chief?

13:40.393 --> 13:43.687
Like I am a good and benevolent dictator.

13:43.772 --> 13:46.190
-[scoffs]
-Like King Wangchuck of Bhutan.

13:46.274 --> 13:48.567
He created
the Gross National Happiness scale

13:48.651 --> 13:52.738
so his people would be content
and remain loyal.

13:52.822 --> 13:54.490
And how did that work out for him?

13:55.533 --> 13:57.035
Yeah.

13:57.118 --> 13:59.788
There's no such thing
as a benevolent dictator,

13:59.871 --> 14:01.580
only a weak one, or a dead one.

14:01.664 --> 14:05.709
He did not die.
He abdicated voluntarily.

14:05.794 --> 14:06.878
You know what I mean.

14:06.961 --> 14:08.754
You're letting the fox
back into the hen house.

14:08.838 --> 14:12.591
You dumped me because I fired Flaca,

14:12.675 --> 14:15.261
and now you're criticizing me
for bringing her back.

14:15.344 --> 14:18.306
I broke up with you because
you were being gross,

14:18.389 --> 14:19.808
and now you're being stupid.

14:19.891 --> 14:23.895
That girl wants to fuck you over
and get her prison cred back.

14:23.978 --> 14:24.979
But you're right.

14:25.063 --> 14:27.857
It's none of my business.

14:27.941 --> 14:29.776
Godfather knows best.

14:36.407 --> 14:38.159
[Gloria] Oh, shit!

14:38.242 --> 14:40.078
-[speaking Spanish]
-What the fuck?

14:43.873 --> 14:46.042
Well, can't make it worse.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.501
Seriously?

14:47.585 --> 14:50.379
You feed people food from
the fucking floor, like we're animals?

14:50.463 --> 14:53.424
Maybe we should all get down
on our knees and lick it up!

14:53.507 --> 14:54.884
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:54.968 --> 14:56.135
I'm kidding.

14:56.219 --> 14:59.638
They doubled our order of slop this month,
we can cover it.

15:00.807 --> 15:01.975
What's gotten into you?

15:02.058 --> 15:03.726
It's not your problem.

15:04.894 --> 15:06.770
She got man troubles.

15:06.855 --> 15:08.982
Well, why didn't you say so?

15:10.817 --> 15:12.401
Don't give it back when you're done.

15:12.485 --> 15:14.487
Not that kind of man.

15:14.570 --> 15:16.030
What other kind is there?

15:19.158 --> 15:20.326
[Gloria sighs]

15:20.409 --> 15:21.828
The kind with tits.

15:21.911 --> 15:24.831
Burset? They took her to Seg.

15:24.914 --> 15:27.041
I've had enough.
What's done is done.

15:27.125 --> 15:28.334
Let's not beat a dead horse.

15:28.417 --> 15:30.503
Black Beauty was the one beat you.

15:30.586 --> 15:33.172
-You ask me, it got what was coming.
-Uh-uh.

15:33.256 --> 15:35.591
-Don't blame me for what happened.
-I'm giving you credit.

15:35.674 --> 15:38.177
You were the one that started spreading
all those rumors about her.

15:38.261 --> 15:40.847
So I'll take credit, too.
Mission accomplished.

15:40.930 --> 15:43.057
You two need to clean this up.

15:43.141 --> 15:44.934
I'll get the mop.

15:45.018 --> 15:50.439
Gloria, sometimes there's a mess.
It happens.

15:53.776 --> 15:55.194
Yeah.

16:00.449 --> 16:03.494
Something's the matter.
I can tell.

16:03.577 --> 16:06.873
I got this talent for knowing
when things are bothering people.

16:06.956 --> 16:07.999
Nothing's bothering me.

16:08.082 --> 16:12.170
Yeah, something is.
I can feel it in my elbow.

16:12.253 --> 16:14.463
All the women in my family
got the knowing elbow.

16:16.174 --> 16:18.051
Yeah, well,
something's bothering you, too.

16:18.134 --> 16:19.343
I can feel it in my toe.

16:19.427 --> 16:20.594
Which toe?

16:22.096 --> 16:24.307
Oh, you're bluffing.

16:25.558 --> 16:27.685
All right, fine.

16:27.768 --> 16:29.645
-You want me to say this?
-Yeah.

16:29.728 --> 16:31.397
I think we should end this.

16:33.857 --> 16:35.318
Oh, no.

16:35.401 --> 16:40.573
No, that is not
what I was thinking at all.

16:42.158 --> 16:43.201
It wasn't?

16:43.284 --> 16:45.244
No, I...

16:45.328 --> 16:48.497
I was thinking how hard
gravity had been on me

16:48.581 --> 16:51.750
'cause I fell so far
so fast for you.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.712
I was gonna tell you I love you,

16:54.795 --> 16:58.382
and I ain't never said that to nobody,
except this one guy before.

16:59.092 --> 17:01.219
You telling me you don't love me?

17:01.302 --> 17:04.055
It ain't got nothing
to do with feelings, okay?

17:04.137 --> 17:05.888
-[whimpers]
-I got crazy feelings for you.

17:05.973 --> 17:08.892
Pauly D, JWoww 2010 kind of feelings.

17:08.977 --> 17:12.355
-But that's the problem, you know?
-I don't get that!

17:12.438 --> 17:14.357
They couldn't act on them.

17:15.398 --> 17:16.900
JWoww had a boyfriend.

17:16.984 --> 17:18.444
You got prison.

17:18.527 --> 17:20.654
Well, there's nowhere to go.

17:20.738 --> 17:23.156
It's like it's blue balls,
but for my heart, Lorna.

17:23.241 --> 17:26.077
No, this is not happening. I...

17:27.494 --> 17:30.456
I was saving this for my vision board.

17:30.539 --> 17:33.376
But all vision, no action
kills Hamlet, right?

17:33.459 --> 17:35.586
I guess.
I don't really know.

17:35.669 --> 17:37.505
It did. I saw the movie.

17:40.216 --> 17:41.259
Whoa, whoa.

17:41.342 --> 17:43.094
Come on, baby.
What are you doing?

17:45.013 --> 17:48.474
I love you, Vince Muccio.

17:48.557 --> 17:51.602
And I love everything
that you've done for me,

17:51.685 --> 17:55.648
especially beating up that
good-for-nothing Christopher,

17:55.731 --> 17:58.609
showing me what a real man looks like.

17:59.777 --> 18:01.820
I wanna spend my life with you...

18:03.114 --> 18:05.366
and I don't wanna wait.

18:05.449 --> 18:07.493
Inmate, back in your seat!

18:08.577 --> 18:09.870
I want you to marry me.

18:11.372 --> 18:14.792
Morello, no touching!
Back in your seat, now!

18:20.464 --> 18:22.341
Well, don't leave a girl hanging.

18:23.717 --> 18:24.968
What do you say?

18:27.971 --> 18:33.311
You are the most amazing girl
I have ever met, Lorna Morello.

18:33.394 --> 18:36.397
I mean, it should be
the guy doing the asking,

18:36.480 --> 18:38.524
but I gotta say there's something
kind of hot about you

18:38.607 --> 18:39.692
down on your knees like that.

18:39.775 --> 18:40.943
[laughs]

18:46.615 --> 18:47.658
Yes.

18:47.741 --> 18:48.742
[gasps]

18:48.826 --> 18:51.329
-Yes. Yes, I will.
-Oh!

18:51.412 --> 18:53.247
I will marry you.
I will marry you.

18:55.041 --> 18:58.377
I swear, I'm gonna be...

18:58.461 --> 19:00.879
such a good wife.

19:00.963 --> 19:02.965
-The best.
-The best.

19:03.049 --> 19:04.175
I don't want you to go,

19:04.258 --> 19:06.844
but I think we should say goodbye
so we can kiss. Yeah?

19:06.927 --> 19:07.928
Okay.

19:08.011 --> 19:10.139
CO Ford, uh, we are done here.

19:10.223 --> 19:13.476
Can we say goodbye
and maybe kiss a little, please?

19:30.993 --> 19:32.786
[Vince moaning]

19:33.871 --> 19:35.038
All right, wrap it up.

19:38.917 --> 19:40.461
Morello, wrap it up!

19:46.259 --> 19:47.676
[Father John] The body of Christ.

19:48.719 --> 19:50.012
[girl 1] Amen.

19:50.096 --> 19:51.722
[Father John] The body of Christ.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.059
-The body of Christ.
-[boy 1] Amen.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.233
[Father John] The body of Christ.
[girl 2] Amen.

20:02.316 --> 20:03.401
The body of Christ.

20:04.860 --> 20:07.155
-[girl 3] Amen.
-The body of Christ.

20:10.199 --> 20:12.535
Ah, look at my little princess.

20:12.618 --> 20:15.871
You got Christ in your body now, dolly.
That means you got responsibilities.

20:15.954 --> 20:18.332
-I love this dress!
-What's in your hand?

20:18.416 --> 20:21.544
I read in a magazine
that white food makes you fat.

20:21.627 --> 20:24.380
You didn't eat your Eucharist?
She didn't eat her Eucharist.

20:24.463 --> 20:26.882
You gotta eat the cracker, Lorna.
The cracker's the whole point.

20:26.965 --> 20:29.343
No, Mommy,
the dress is the whole point!

20:29.427 --> 20:32.680
Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you, Jesus!

20:32.763 --> 20:36.809
-[indistinct conversations]
-[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

20:51.740 --> 20:54.410
-Should I remain silent?
-Actually, I...

20:54.493 --> 20:56.204
I could use a nice chat.

20:58.581 --> 21:00.374
You ever believe in anything, Red?

21:00.458 --> 21:04.920
Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova.

21:05.003 --> 21:09.383
Her father drove a tractor
and her mother worked in a textile plant,

21:09.467 --> 21:12.636
and she went to outer space
in a rocket ship.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.265
First woman to do that.
I worshipped her.

21:16.349 --> 21:17.391
What happened?

21:17.475 --> 21:20.143
Nothing, I still think she's terrific.

21:20.228 --> 21:23.522
She's in her 70s now
and she wants to go to Mars.

21:23.606 --> 21:25.274
Put in a request with Putin.

21:26.192 --> 21:28.236
Russians stay focused.

21:33.991 --> 21:37.495
This doesn't feel like
the good kind of silence.

21:37.578 --> 21:38.579
It's not.

21:38.662 --> 21:40.873
[Angie sighs]
At least it's bread day.

21:40.956 --> 21:44.252
And it's so over-toasted,
you could pretend it was a cracker.

21:44.335 --> 21:45.836
Wait.

21:52.260 --> 21:55.679
I never doubted you, not for a second!

21:55.763 --> 21:57.848
Gently, gently. Hold it up.

22:01.727 --> 22:04.980
It's her! It's exactly her!

22:06.607 --> 22:08.526
-Oh, my Norma!
-Careful.

22:08.609 --> 22:09.777
[Angie gasps]

22:11.779 --> 22:13.406
It's Toast Norma.

22:14.448 --> 22:17.451
It's a miracle. Toast Norma!

22:17.535 --> 22:18.869
Toast Norma!

22:21.705 --> 22:25.709
It's like one of those 3D poster thingies
from when we were kids.

22:25.793 --> 22:27.920
You gotta wait a second to see it.

22:33.842 --> 22:35.511
Praise be to Norma.

22:35.594 --> 22:40.766
Her image has been emblazoned
by the universe unto toast

22:40.849 --> 22:44.687
as a reminder of her power
and goodliness here on this earth.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.524
There's never any dignity at the end.

22:48.607 --> 22:51.276
Yeah, I'm gonna check it out.

22:51.360 --> 22:54.822
Gina. Gina... don't be a fool.

22:54.905 --> 22:58.492
I have a birthmark on my left butt cheek
that's shaped like a scarab.

22:58.576 --> 23:00.243
Doesn't make me Cleopatra.

23:00.328 --> 23:02.371
[Babs] Yo, Norma, you in their toast!

23:02.455 --> 23:04.415
-[Angie chuckling]
-[Babs] You in the toast!

23:04.498 --> 23:06.500
[Gina] What's going on?

23:06.584 --> 23:10.128
-Gaze upon the glory of the toast.
-[whispering] You in the toast.

23:10.212 --> 23:12.214
-Look at that!
-Yeah, I don't see it. It...

23:12.297 --> 23:14.216
Oh, holy mother, there it is in,
in the burn marks.

23:14.299 --> 23:15.884
-Yeah!
-Oh, it's beautiful!

23:15.968 --> 23:18.846
[Leanne] It's a gift. It's a gift.

23:18.929 --> 23:23.351
[Angie] It's a gift! Thank you.
Thank you, Norma.

23:23.434 --> 23:24.560
[Gina] It's so crazy.
[Leanne] Toast Norma.

23:24.643 --> 23:26.061
[Angie] It's a miracle.

23:26.144 --> 23:28.731
[Gina] Norma, it looks just like you.
[Angie] It's a real miracle.

23:29.690 --> 23:32.275
-She's sleeping again.
-[Poussey] What?

23:32.360 --> 23:33.402
Yo, Bennie.

23:33.486 --> 23:35.320
-Wake up.
-[Poussey scoffs]

23:35.404 --> 23:36.697
"Bennie"?

23:36.780 --> 23:38.574
Yeah, we checked out them foils, man.

23:38.657 --> 23:40.451
You took, like, 100 Benadryls.

23:40.534 --> 23:44.455
But the good news is your allergies are
squared away for, like, a decade.

23:44.538 --> 23:46.123
[all laughing]

23:46.206 --> 23:48.584
I still don't understand
why we're helping her anyway.

23:48.667 --> 23:49.835
She ain't one of us.

23:49.918 --> 23:52.588
Because you have never been to Psych.

23:52.671 --> 23:54.297
Nobody saved me from the SHU.

23:54.382 --> 23:56.592
Well, eventually,
you come back from the SHU.

23:56.675 --> 23:58.260
And look, besides, as long as she with us,

23:58.343 --> 24:01.096
we're gonna be like
the Tiger Woods of prison cliques.

24:01.179 --> 24:03.056
Blasian is beautiful.

24:03.140 --> 24:04.517
Hey, that's right.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.437
Your skin doesn't have to be black,
as long as your heart is black.

24:09.688 --> 24:11.189
Um...

24:11.273 --> 24:12.441
She's sleeping again.

24:12.525 --> 24:14.860
[scoffs] You've been pretty chill
about all of this.

24:14.943 --> 24:17.530
-Shh. [grunts]
-Man, what you doin', anyway?

24:17.613 --> 24:20.616
Well, for your nosy information,
I'm working on my conversion essay.

24:20.699 --> 24:23.160
-You still on that?
-You damn right.

24:23.243 --> 24:24.703
-[Janae chuckles]
-No matter what they take from me,

24:24.787 --> 24:26.789
they can't take away
my motherfucking kosher meals.

24:26.872 --> 24:31.293
Okay. I got a Black Jew,
I got an Asian Black,

24:31.376 --> 24:34.046
a bunch of race-squatting carpetbaggers.

24:34.129 --> 24:38.842
You've disciplined your body in accordance
with the teachings of blessed Elijah,

24:38.926 --> 24:41.178
for the glory of Allah.

24:41.261 --> 24:42.971
But anything more, anything more,

24:43.055 --> 24:46.016
is self-aggrandizing and immodest,
and I forbid it.

24:46.099 --> 24:48.268
What about college?

24:48.351 --> 24:50.353
Running track can pay for it.

24:50.438 --> 24:54.274
Not if it means running half-naked
in public, like a common whore.

24:54.357 --> 24:56.068
I can't compete wearing a tent.

24:56.151 --> 24:59.863
She has a talent and a passion,
and college,

24:59.947 --> 25:03.617
a good college, is out of reach
without this.

25:03.701 --> 25:08.246
Especially for a woman.
Especially for a black woman.

25:08.330 --> 25:10.791
-Money is not my god.
-[sighs]

25:12.626 --> 25:15.838
Maybe Allah ain't my god.

25:17.214 --> 25:21.301
Maybe I don't want to be
a proud daughter in the Nation of Islam.

25:21.384 --> 25:23.178
[gasps]

25:33.438 --> 25:35.941
[speaking Spanish] I mean, at least
she knows who the father is, right?

25:36.024 --> 25:38.569
Even if he's a shit-eating pussy
who walked out.

25:38.652 --> 25:39.695
Mmm.

25:39.778 --> 25:42.823
That baby ain't never
gonna hear the name Bennett.

25:42.906 --> 25:46.702
My dad was either Julio,
Rodrigo, or Chad.

25:46.785 --> 25:49.371
My luck, it was fucking Chad.

25:49.454 --> 25:51.707
-[Maritza] A mailbox that leaks pee.
-Uh-uh.

25:52.541 --> 25:54.001
[Maritza] I asked for a C-section,

25:54.084 --> 25:57.004
so my sails wouldn't be
flapping in the wind.

25:57.087 --> 25:58.589
I don't have anything flapping.

25:58.672 --> 26:01.341
It feels like, you know, when you get
punched in the eye and it swells shut?

26:01.424 --> 26:02.801
Except I got punched in the chocha.

26:02.885 --> 26:05.262
You're back,
and you didn't come talk to your mother?

26:05.345 --> 26:06.429
What kind of shit is that?

26:06.514 --> 26:07.640
[Dayanara scoffs]

26:07.723 --> 26:10.518
I knew I didn't have to
'cause you're gonna butt in anyway.

26:10.601 --> 26:12.227
You got what you wanted, didn't you?

26:12.310 --> 26:14.021
I was with my baby two hours,

26:14.104 --> 26:16.940
getting ready to hand it over
to Pornstache's mom.

26:17.024 --> 26:20.110
And who shows up?
Cesar and our cousin, Yas.

26:20.193 --> 26:22.863
Don't pretend like you ain't happy,
'cause I know you are.

26:22.946 --> 26:24.156
Ah, you don't know anything.

26:25.157 --> 26:28.577
You're happy, but you can't say it
'cause you gotta hate me.

26:29.620 --> 26:32.122
You said keeping the baby
was the worst thing for her.

26:32.205 --> 26:33.541
Yeah, well, kids adapt.

26:33.624 --> 26:35.793
-[sighs]
-Marc Anthony grew up in the projects

26:35.876 --> 26:39.212
and now he's rich and got to stick it
to J. Lo even though he's pocket-size.

26:40.213 --> 26:42.049
And this was about you.

26:42.966 --> 26:46.303
I know that feeling you got
when you had her in your arms.

26:46.386 --> 26:49.347
And if that went away forever,
you'd be all kinds of fucked up.

26:49.431 --> 26:52.309
[sighs]
You make her sound like she's drugs.

26:52.392 --> 26:53.852
The worst kind.

26:55.145 --> 26:58.566
She's gonna make you feel better
than you ever thought you could,

26:58.649 --> 27:01.151
then drain all your money
and ruin your life.

27:02.152 --> 27:03.403
You're always gonna need her.

27:04.738 --> 27:07.700
And even when you hate her,
you're gonna love her.

27:08.909 --> 27:10.828
Even when she's in prison with you.

27:11.829 --> 27:12.830
[sighs]

27:18.376 --> 27:21.213
-Thank you.
-Was that so fucking hard?

27:23.298 --> 27:26.844
Nosing whiskey isn't like sniffing wine.

27:26.927 --> 27:29.262
Now, you'd fry your brain
right out of your skull

27:29.346 --> 27:32.600
with full nasal insertion
into the tumbler.

27:32.683 --> 27:34.768
No, nosing is an art form of its own.

27:34.852 --> 27:37.813
All right, when you boys are ready,
go ahead and imbibe.

27:37.896 --> 27:39.064
But don't swallow.

27:39.147 --> 27:41.650
Chew the scotch.

27:41.734 --> 27:45.570
Let it explore the different
taste corners of your tongue.

27:45.654 --> 27:48.573
[whispers] He stole all that fellating
whiskey stuff from a YouTube video.

27:48.657 --> 27:50.117
You got something to say there, Danny?

27:50.200 --> 27:52.494
Dad, uh, we just really need
to get down to business.

27:52.577 --> 27:55.122
-[coughs]
-Danny, I'm trying to teach you.

27:55.205 --> 27:56.539
It's all business.

27:56.624 --> 28:00.085
The club, the bullshit, it's a dance.

28:00.168 --> 28:02.212
Yeah, well, Burset comes out of the SHU.
Cha-cha-cha.

28:02.295 --> 28:03.505
[sighs]

28:04.339 --> 28:05.799
Uh, Burset comes out of the SHU.

28:05.883 --> 28:07.384
I heard you the first time.

28:08.468 --> 28:09.552
Where was your preamble?

28:09.637 --> 28:12.347
Where was the lead-in
where you reminded me

28:12.430 --> 28:15.768
how you saved money on the fence repair
and the new meal plan?

28:15.851 --> 28:18.020
Come on, I taught you better!

28:18.603 --> 28:20.814
Tell me about the new beds
we're installing.

28:20.898 --> 28:23.651
Tell me how much more money
we're gonna make.

28:23.734 --> 28:26.569
Mr. Pearson, we need to focus

28:26.654 --> 28:29.531
on the people we're tucking
into these new beds,

28:29.614 --> 28:31.992
or any budget surplus we find

28:32.075 --> 28:36.789
is going straight to fight one
gross-negligence lawsuit after another.

28:36.872 --> 28:41.043
We have a chance
to set the pace with Burset.

28:41.126 --> 28:43.003
We can't keep her in the SHU forever,

28:43.086 --> 28:46.173
and the longer we do,
the more we open ourselves up for...

28:46.256 --> 28:48.676
Let me back you up here
for a second, Joe.

28:48.759 --> 28:51.970
Ms. Burset is in protective custody,

28:52.054 --> 28:54.765
-not solitary confinement.
-[sighs]

28:54.848 --> 28:57.267
It's both one and the horrible same, sir.

28:57.350 --> 28:59.227
[sighs] I understand.

28:59.311 --> 29:04.775
And we need to talk about updating
our facilities and our policies

29:04.858 --> 29:06.985
about their use as a long-term priority.

29:07.069 --> 29:09.571
-Well, how can a priority be long-term?
-Uh, Danny...

29:09.655 --> 29:13.533
No, no, no, a priority by definition is
something that needs to happen right now.

29:13.616 --> 29:14.785
I think what Danny means--

29:14.868 --> 29:16.787
No, no, no, no, he knows what I mean.

29:16.870 --> 29:18.706
What I mean is
Burset comes out of the SHU,

29:18.789 --> 29:20.958
-'cause she didn't do anything wrong!
-All right, son, all right.

29:21.041 --> 29:24.377
No, don't do that! That placating thing!
You're doing it right now!

29:24.461 --> 29:26.714
And you lied to me,
and you did it to my face!

29:26.797 --> 29:28.340
I told you we would
look over our options.

29:28.423 --> 29:29.800
-We did...
-[sighs]

29:29.883 --> 29:31.885
...and there were none better.
So you can either suck it up--

29:31.969 --> 29:33.636
You know, fine!
That's it! I quit!

29:33.721 --> 29:35.180
[man] Whoa, what's going on?

29:35.263 --> 29:38.391
Yeah.
Enjoy nose-fucking your whiskey!

29:39.935 --> 29:41.103
[man] This is out of line.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.122
Find anything good?

30:00.205 --> 30:02.457
These donated books are the suck.

30:03.876 --> 30:05.836
[sighs] I read that one already.

30:05.919 --> 30:08.964
Once you rebuild your bones with butter,
you're gonna have to unclog your arteries

30:09.047 --> 30:11.466
with, like, a Shop-Vac or something.

30:11.549 --> 30:12.760
It's kind of bullshit.

30:12.843 --> 30:13.969
Spoiler alert.

30:15.303 --> 30:19.474
Hey, um, thanks again for giving me
a second chance, Chapman.

30:20.809 --> 30:21.852
I'm really grateful.

30:21.935 --> 30:22.936
Uh-huh.

30:29.651 --> 30:31.820
-[Chang] Next!
-[indistinct conversations]

30:31.904 --> 30:33.113
[Chang] Nah, we don't got that.

30:33.196 --> 30:36.784
All these new guards.
Infiltrators.

30:36.867 --> 30:37.993
[Chang] Next.

30:38.076 --> 30:40.162
Did you see the toothpick guy?

30:40.245 --> 30:42.289
Uh, no. I've been laying real low.

30:42.372 --> 30:43.706
Don't turn around!

30:44.332 --> 30:45.708
-[scoffs]
-[sighs]

30:45.793 --> 30:47.210
They're watching.

30:48.503 --> 30:50.798
There's the squirrelly dude
who looks like a young Jack Nicholson,

30:50.881 --> 30:53.216
who's always givin' everybody donuts.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.093
Then there's the high-school-looking kid

30:55.177 --> 30:58.847
who uses that little baby face
to get away with... something.

30:58.931 --> 31:03.060
And now, there's a toothpick guy.
He started today!

31:03.143 --> 31:04.937
[Chang] Next.

31:05.020 --> 31:07.773
-Thanks. I'll be careful.
-You will be dead.

31:09.024 --> 31:12.360
I haven't even gotten started on
the black Mr. Clean over there.

31:13.904 --> 31:17.615
What, CO Please-and-thank-you?
He's a teddy bear.

31:17.699 --> 31:21.494
Who are the Teddy Bears?
Should I know about them?

31:23.205 --> 31:24.331
[Chang] Next.

31:27.125 --> 31:29.795
Ivory soap, Colgate, Diet Coke.

31:32.965 --> 31:33.966
[Chang] Bad choice.

31:34.049 --> 31:37.510
Aspartame invented by
Donald Rumsfeld in the '80s.

31:38.678 --> 31:40.763
Mind control.

31:40.848 --> 31:42.099
That's true.

31:42.182 --> 31:44.267
Seriously? You, too?

31:45.477 --> 31:48.105
Did you know that Monsanto

31:48.188 --> 31:51.691
gave Donald Rumsfeld
$12 million for aspartame in 1985?

31:51.774 --> 31:53.193
Yes.

31:54.111 --> 31:55.487
All right, we should talk.

31:55.570 --> 31:56.822
[knocking on door]

31:57.739 --> 31:59.782
Soso, thanks for comin'.

31:59.867 --> 32:02.619
Please, have a seat.

32:06.789 --> 32:08.041
Are you okay?

32:09.292 --> 32:11.253
You look, uh...

32:12.420 --> 32:14.797
Did they give you
your prescription at medical?

32:15.798 --> 32:18.051
Well, sometimes it takes
a couple of weeks to even out.

32:18.135 --> 32:19.845
What did you wanna see me about?

32:19.928 --> 32:21.304
Berdie Rogers.

32:22.389 --> 32:23.640
Is she coming back?

32:24.892 --> 32:29.687
Mr. Caputo is gonna be talking
to several inmates about her conduct.

32:29.771 --> 32:31.689
I want you to know that you can trust him.

32:31.773 --> 32:35.318
You can basically tell him
anything you would tell me.

32:35.402 --> 32:40.573
For example, don't be afraid to tell him
that you spoke with her for several weeks

32:40.657 --> 32:43.118
and she offered you
no medical care for your...

32:44.327 --> 32:45.662
Your mental condition.

32:47.789 --> 32:50.583
You're really bad at your job, Mr. Healy.

32:53.503 --> 32:56.298
Like, really bad.

32:58.341 --> 33:01.844
You make me feel worse about myself
every time we talk.

33:03.721 --> 33:05.182
Berdie helped me.

33:06.808 --> 33:08.726
I'm going now.

33:17.945 --> 33:20.030
-We're ready.
-You made that?

33:20.113 --> 33:21.531
Mmm-hmm. [chuckles]

33:21.614 --> 33:24.117
As good as any tattoo gun
you'll see in the real world.

33:24.201 --> 33:25.535
I mean, almost.

33:25.618 --> 33:27.579
This is a spinny thing
from an old Discman,

33:27.662 --> 33:30.123
and that drives the needle
that I snagged from the sweatshop.

33:30.207 --> 33:32.375
Where did you find a Discman?

33:32.459 --> 33:34.502
One of the OG ladies.

33:34.586 --> 33:37.797
She traded it for a fan.
Thank God for hot flashes.

33:39.799 --> 33:41.969
Add a little power.

33:42.052 --> 33:43.261
[tattoo machine whirring]

33:44.762 --> 33:46.764
And some ink.

33:47.933 --> 33:50.810
Now all I need... is the girl.

33:51.853 --> 33:56.524
I'm thinking an infinity symbol.
I'm thinking a small infinity symbol.

33:56.608 --> 33:57.985
Mmm-mmm. Cliché.

33:58.068 --> 34:00.195
Said the girl with the...

34:02.030 --> 34:03.281
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

34:03.365 --> 34:05.408
Those are all pretty unique.

34:05.492 --> 34:09.161
Let me surprise you.
Unless you don't trust me.

34:09.246 --> 34:11.039
I don't trust anybody,

34:11.123 --> 34:12.958
and I'm starting to have
second thoughts about this.

34:13.041 --> 34:14.833
Chicken. Come on, it's white ink.

34:14.917 --> 34:17.004
You're not even gonna see it,
not unless you're looking for it.

34:18.170 --> 34:20.590
Fine. But subtle.

34:21.757 --> 34:23.342
[tattoo machine whirring]

34:23.426 --> 34:24.511
Ow!

34:24.594 --> 34:25.678
Oh, this hurts.

34:25.762 --> 34:28.348
Um, I need a distraction.

34:28.431 --> 34:32.601
Nope. That's not it at all.
You need to do the opposite.

34:32.685 --> 34:35.272
-You need to honor the pain.
-[grunts]

34:35.355 --> 34:36.523
Really feel it.

34:36.606 --> 34:40.402
Tell yourself you're into it.
It's your pain.

34:40.485 --> 34:41.819
I'm into it?

34:41.902 --> 34:45.322
Yeah, you're really into it.
You own it.

34:47.534 --> 34:49.369
I'm gonna miss you.

34:49.952 --> 34:52.330
At least now you'll have
something to remember me by.

34:52.414 --> 34:53.623
[chuckles]

34:56.333 --> 35:00.672
[man on TV] Something that both
June and Joann don't realize.

35:00.755 --> 35:03.091
Hold on, ladies. Ladies. Okay.

35:03.175 --> 35:06.803
Sister, I got a favor to ask.
Can I make a confession to you?

35:06.886 --> 35:08.971
Of sin or crime?

35:09.056 --> 35:12.559
Not that I'm qualified
to handle either one.

35:12.642 --> 35:13.726
Sin. Guilt.

35:13.810 --> 35:15.478
How about I listen and advise?

35:16.313 --> 35:19.649
-You wanna wait till your show's over?
-Oh, it's a repeat. Go ahead.

35:20.775 --> 35:22.194
[clears throat]

35:25.238 --> 35:28.950
Okay, so, I had a grudge
against this person,

35:29.034 --> 35:31.453
and she got herself into some trouble.

35:31.536 --> 35:34.831
And I never spoke up

35:34.914 --> 35:39.127
and said, "Hey,
she's not really dangerous!"

35:40.128 --> 35:42.047
It's never too late to do the right thing.

35:42.130 --> 35:45.842
It is... if she's already in Seg.

35:45.925 --> 35:47.802
Sophia's my friend,

35:47.885 --> 35:51.931
so forgive me if I have
a hard time staying objective.

35:52.014 --> 35:55.352
[inhales deeply] It's this place.

35:55.435 --> 35:56.436
[sighs]

35:57.354 --> 36:00.857
We're locked up, all of us in a cage.

36:01.941 --> 36:03.985
And it brings out, man...

36:04.069 --> 36:08.490
[whispering] it brings out the worst,
most selfish parts.

36:08.573 --> 36:09.782
It's this place.

36:09.866 --> 36:11.909
It's us.

36:11.993 --> 36:14.704
I didn't say anything either
when they took Sophia to Seg.

36:16.498 --> 36:19.876
[sighs] We fail,
and God forgives us, but...

36:21.836 --> 36:26.133
I don't know if we can ever really...
forgive each other...

36:27.800 --> 36:28.926
or ourselves.

36:29.010 --> 36:31.888
I guess you can say some Hail Marys.

36:31.971 --> 36:34.891
I don't know what else to tell you.
It's all wrong.

36:37.059 --> 36:40.147
[speaking Spanish] Enough, already.
You're going to embarrass me.

36:40.230 --> 36:41.314
Shh!

36:43.024 --> 36:44.317
[sighs]

36:47.612 --> 36:50.157
Oh, my God. Please.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.908
You want a little boy or not?

36:51.991 --> 36:54.911
They already told me last month
it's a girl.

36:54.994 --> 36:56.621
Hokey pokey can't change that.

36:59.666 --> 37:01.459
[speaking English]
Pretend like she ain't even here.

37:03.961 --> 37:05.087
Let's get you set up.

37:07.465 --> 37:10.885
-Okay. This may be a little cold.
-[Gloria] Mmm.

37:14.222 --> 37:15.973
Okay.

37:23.148 --> 37:25.024
Everything's looking good.

37:26.108 --> 37:29.737
Heart's beating like a little hummingbird.
[chuckles]

37:29.821 --> 37:30.905
And the...

37:35.202 --> 37:36.369
What happened?

37:36.453 --> 37:38.955
Uh, no, no. She's fine.
It's just...

37:39.789 --> 37:41.333
she's a he.

37:41.416 --> 37:43.751
It's rare that we're wrong on that, but...

37:43.835 --> 37:45.587
[speaking Spanish] Yes! Amen!

37:45.670 --> 37:48.130
-I can see his little pee-pee right there!
-[chuckles]

37:55.513 --> 37:58.725
I still don't understand
what I'm doing here.

37:58.808 --> 38:01.686
-You a part of my Beit Din.
-Excuse me?

38:01.769 --> 38:03.480
I'm converting.

38:03.563 --> 38:04.981
Mmm-hmm.

38:05.064 --> 38:07.024
This here's Ginsberg.
She's been helping me out.

38:07.108 --> 38:08.401
And that's Boyle.

38:08.485 --> 38:09.736
I know her name don't sound Jewish,

38:09.819 --> 38:13.698
but she Jewish on her mama's side,
and her great-uncle died in the Holocaust,

38:13.781 --> 38:16.117
and she taught me
the Hebrew alphabet for granola bars.

38:16.201 --> 38:19.496
So, I'm here to present my case.

38:19.579 --> 38:21.163
I'm here to ask three times

38:21.248 --> 38:24.000
and get told "No" and "No,"
and then "Yes,"

38:24.083 --> 38:25.293
and then be a Jew.

38:25.377 --> 38:28.380
I'm here to take the name Tova,
which means "good"...

38:29.339 --> 38:30.548
because it's all good now.

38:32.509 --> 38:34.469
I've been working for real, Rabbi.
Try me.

38:34.552 --> 38:36.178
-[sighs]
-For serious!

38:36.263 --> 38:38.097
I'm ready to get my Jew on.

38:38.180 --> 38:42.018
And it ain't just about the food,
although the more I been learnin',

38:42.101 --> 38:44.145
the food a big part of it, am I right?

38:44.229 --> 38:45.980
She's been really dedicated.

38:46.063 --> 38:48.525
Why she wants to go from being
a hated minority

38:48.608 --> 38:52.737
to a double-hated minority is beyond me,
but she's for real.

38:53.488 --> 38:55.573
We've been studying, arguing.

38:57.199 --> 39:01.746
Hey, uh, you wouldn't happen to be
related to Aimee Tatelbaum, would you?

39:01.829 --> 39:03.373
She's my cousin.

39:03.456 --> 39:06.793
Oh, my God!
We were at Penn together.

39:06.876 --> 39:08.336
[chuckles]

39:08.420 --> 39:11.172
Wait, Alan? Cousin Alan?

39:11.256 --> 39:12.882
[laughs]

39:12.965 --> 39:16.803
I know some things about you.
Oh, Alan.

39:16.886 --> 39:19.472
You'd better Beit Din this woman
before I start to talk.

39:19.556 --> 39:22.267
-Well, Aimee's full of shit.
-Oh, is she?

39:22.350 --> 39:25.603
Like the story about you and
the Berkshires with Samantha Gottleib

39:25.687 --> 39:28.565
-and the mushrooms, that's bullshit? Yeah.
-That's not... [scoffs]

39:28.648 --> 39:30.567
-Ask, Tova. Ask.
-Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

39:30.650 --> 39:32.277
Hey. [clears throat]

39:33.445 --> 39:36.197
-Can I be a Jew?
-No.

39:37.282 --> 39:39.241
Can I be a Jew?

39:39.326 --> 39:40.618
No.

39:40.702 --> 39:41.994
[chuckles]

39:43.788 --> 39:45.332
Can I be a Jew?

39:46.666 --> 39:48.000
You really want this?

39:48.793 --> 39:50.252
Sincerely?

39:50.337 --> 39:54.131
Not because this one's trying to blackmail
me for something stupid when I was 19

39:54.215 --> 39:56.843
or for broccoli with your dinner?

39:56.926 --> 39:58.303
What is this for you?

40:03.641 --> 40:05.059
Honestly...

40:07.354 --> 40:08.355
[sighs]

40:14.611 --> 40:15.903
[sniffles]

40:18.280 --> 40:20.157
I think I found my people.

40:22.827 --> 40:24.120
[exhales sharply]

40:25.913 --> 40:28.708
I was raised in a church...

40:28.791 --> 40:31.836
where I was told to believe and pray.

40:33.671 --> 40:36.090
And if I was bad, I'd go to hell.

40:36.173 --> 40:38.843
If I was good, I'd go to heaven.

40:38.926 --> 40:42.930
And if I'd ask Jesus,
he'd forgive me, and that was that.

40:43.014 --> 40:46.476
And here y'all saying ain't no hell...
ain't...

40:47.769 --> 40:49.729
sure about heaven.

40:49.812 --> 40:54.275
And if you do something wrong,
you got to figure it out yourself.

40:54.359 --> 40:56.569
And as far as God's concerned,

40:56.653 --> 41:02.324
it's your job to keep aksing questions
and to keep learning and to keep arguing.

41:02.409 --> 41:06.954
It's like a verb.
It's like... you do God.

41:09.123 --> 41:11.125
And that's a lot of work. [sighs]

41:12.419 --> 41:16.255
But I think I'm in,
at least as far as I can see it.

41:17.424 --> 41:18.800
I mean, maybe I'll learn more...

41:20.927 --> 41:22.929
and say, "Fuck the whole thing."

41:23.012 --> 41:28.225
I mean, but I wanna learn more,
and I think I gotta be in it to do that.

41:28.309 --> 41:30.311
You know, does that make sense?

41:30.395 --> 41:32.772
Shit, did I just talk myself out of it?

41:36.358 --> 41:37.444
Fuck.

41:43.240 --> 41:44.409
Ask me again.

41:44.492 --> 41:45.493
[sighs]

41:51.123 --> 41:53.042
-Can I be a Jew?
-Yes.

41:53.125 --> 41:55.127
No, I need three answers.

41:55.211 --> 41:57.296
-Yes.
-Yes.

41:58.423 --> 41:59.466
[exhales sharply]

41:59.549 --> 42:01.468
Yeah! [chuckles]

42:03.052 --> 42:06.388
Look at me now!
I'm a bona fide jailhouse Jew!

42:07.389 --> 42:09.976
Sort of. It's not really official
without the mikvah,

42:10.059 --> 42:13.104
but that was wonderful.
Really, Tova. Congratulations.

42:13.187 --> 42:14.689
Hold up. Mik-what?

42:14.772 --> 42:16.441
Oh, it's like, um...

42:16.524 --> 42:19.151
It's like a baptism,
but without all the touching.

42:19.235 --> 42:20.487
You soak in a pool

42:20.570 --> 42:24.115
and you clean off all that Christian filth
that you've been carrying around.

42:24.198 --> 42:25.241
-[clicks tongue]
-[chuckles]

42:25.324 --> 42:27.869
-We can fake that shit in the shower.
-No, that won't count.

42:27.952 --> 42:30.538
The mikvah needs to be pure,
naturally occurring water,

42:30.622 --> 42:33.082
and you need to be fully submerged,
and nude.

42:33.165 --> 42:35.376
Yeah. Maybe it'll rain, okay?

42:35.460 --> 42:38.588
There'll be a sinkhole or something,
and we'll make it official then.

42:38.671 --> 42:41.298
In the meantime, you are Jew-ish.

42:41.382 --> 42:42.383
Huh?

42:45.386 --> 42:48.681
[Black Cindy's Dad] Most holy, righteous,
and everywhere-present God,

42:48.765 --> 42:53.853
our Father who art in Heaven,
we ask thy blessing upon this food.

42:53.936 --> 42:57.023
Bless the hearts and the hands
of those that provide the same,

42:57.106 --> 43:01.402
and when it is ours to pass
from time to eternity...

43:04.697 --> 43:05.698
[gasps]

43:05.782 --> 43:08.493
Do you know what awaits sinners like you,

43:08.576 --> 43:10.452
self-worshippers of the flesh?

43:10.537 --> 43:13.956
Do you know what is your Promised Land?

43:14.040 --> 43:16.333
Answer me, Cindy!
Do you know?

43:17.459 --> 43:22.632
Deuteronomy, chapter 29, verse 23,
tells us about your Promised Land.

43:22.715 --> 43:25.009
Your land is brimstone and salt,

43:25.092 --> 43:28.345
a burning waste, unsown and unproductive,

43:28.429 --> 43:32.308
and no grass grows on it,
like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah.

43:32.391 --> 43:36.187
So thou must not sin! Amen!

43:36.270 --> 43:38.480
-[all] Amen.
-Say "amen"!

43:38.565 --> 43:41.693
Amen, amen, amen, amen.

43:45.863 --> 43:47.323
Maxwell said you wanted to see me?

43:47.406 --> 43:50.702
Yeah, Morello's getting married.
She asked that you be the witness.

43:50.785 --> 43:53.370
Ah, I heard the happy news an hour ago.

43:53.454 --> 43:55.289
Oh, she's a rash girl.

43:55.372 --> 43:59.043
All heart and tits and no brain, hmm?

43:59.126 --> 44:00.962
Well, thanks for letting me know.

44:01.045 --> 44:04.048
I'll get started
on my maid of honor speech.

44:04.131 --> 44:05.299
Can I ask you a question?

44:08.344 --> 44:09.887
[Healy sighs]

44:17.311 --> 44:22.734
You and I... have a special relationship.

44:22.817 --> 44:25.612
That's why I feel like
I can ask you this question.

44:25.695 --> 44:28.656
Would you say that I'm bad at my job?

44:28.740 --> 44:32.118
Well, the very fact
that we have a special relationship

44:32.201 --> 44:33.620
and that you acknowledge it

44:33.703 --> 44:36.873
should at least partially
answer your question, Healy.

44:37.915 --> 44:40.585
But I'd be lying
if I said it hasn't helped me.

44:41.252 --> 44:43.254
It has.

44:43.337 --> 44:46.758
Having a contemporary in here
who isn't A, a woman,

44:46.841 --> 44:51.512
and B, a thieving, lying, crazy,
murderous, drug-addled woman,

44:51.595 --> 44:53.765
-has been a godsend.
-[sighs]

44:53.848 --> 44:55.892
Are you good at your job?

44:55.975 --> 44:58.102
I don't know.

44:59.603 --> 45:03.565
But I know that you've helped me,
and I'm grateful to you for it.

45:06.360 --> 45:09.656
Can I go now that
I've watered your ego flower?

45:09.739 --> 45:11.866
[chuckles] Yes.

45:14.118 --> 45:18.122
[Cal] Your prison mistress
gave you a prison tat.

45:18.205 --> 45:19.666
You are turning into a trope.

45:19.749 --> 45:22.960
-She's my business partner, with benefits.
-Ah.

45:23.044 --> 45:25.922
She's getting out and wanted to
give me something to remember her by.

45:26.005 --> 45:28.007
I was sad, so I let her.

45:28.090 --> 45:30.509
White ink, huh?

45:30.592 --> 45:34.513
That must be pretty intimidating
to some of these girls,

45:34.596 --> 45:37.183
maybe under, like,
a black light or something.

45:38.100 --> 45:40.352
-What does it say?
-It says "Trust no bitch."

45:41.103 --> 45:44.565
And yes, as a matter of fact,
the girls are scared shitless.

45:45.316 --> 45:46.317
Hmm.

45:47.151 --> 45:48.527
I'm quite gangsta.

45:49.904 --> 45:50.947
[sighs]

45:51.030 --> 45:55.242
Oh, shit. What?

45:55.326 --> 45:58.329
I have to give you honesty,
because that's how I need to live,

45:58.412 --> 45:59.455
in truth.

45:59.538 --> 46:01.123
What the fuck, Cal?

46:01.207 --> 46:04.168
Neri is selling extra panties on the side.

46:05.419 --> 46:06.838
What? No.

46:06.921 --> 46:08.255
-Yeah.
-All wrong.

46:08.339 --> 46:09.673
And where's she getting
people to wear them?

46:09.757 --> 46:15.012
Well, um, actually, we invented
a miso-tuna-honey sauce

46:15.096 --> 46:17.974
that tastes quite delicious
until you add the glue.

46:18.057 --> 46:21.435
You're diluting the brand.
You have to get her to stop.

46:21.518 --> 46:23.645
Neri's knock-off prison panties
aren't the problem.

46:23.730 --> 46:27.399
In fact, her questionable criminal ethics
might actually offset the real problem.

46:27.483 --> 46:30.361
My job is to handle shit in here.
Your job is to handle shit out there.

46:30.444 --> 46:34.531
Okay, Pipes, while I'm really proud
of how evil prison has made you,

46:34.615 --> 46:36.784
I think you're overestimating
your villain index.

46:36.868 --> 46:38.745
You're still transitioning.

46:38.828 --> 46:41.622
You know, you're not Walter White yet.
You're...

46:41.705 --> 46:42.749
Walter White-ink.

46:42.832 --> 46:44.291
What are you talking about?

46:46.168 --> 46:47.669
Your money is gone.

46:48.712 --> 46:51.382
Somebody transferred
all of your clam clams.

46:52.216 --> 46:54.135
-When?
-This morning.

46:55.261 --> 46:57.096
Fucking Flaca!

47:04.603 --> 47:05.855
[weeping]

47:17.992 --> 47:19.368
[Poussey scoffs]

47:20.953 --> 47:24.373
Was a time, Norma, you were good
at making people feel safe...

47:25.124 --> 47:27.168
at peace and calm.

47:27.251 --> 47:29.879
Then you let this cave troll
turn it into a cult.

47:29.962 --> 47:32.506
Hey, we're toasting Norma here.
It's our new thing.

47:32.589 --> 47:35.259
Brook Soso tried to kill herself.

47:35.342 --> 47:37.344
She needed help,
and you pushed her away.

47:37.428 --> 47:39.972
As far as I'm concerned,
that makes you an accessory.

47:40.056 --> 47:42.308
-What the fuck?
-You better back up off

47:42.391 --> 47:45.644
before I smash those shit-stained
Chiclets you call teeth down your throat!

47:49.190 --> 47:51.483
[scoffs]
Look at all of y'all.

47:51.567 --> 47:55.237
The whole point of being here
was to escape our shitty reality.

47:55.321 --> 47:58.407
What, and now you're worshipping
a piece of toast?

48:01.327 --> 48:03.955
You know, you actually
had me believing in miracles.

48:05.081 --> 48:08.209
But now I know miracles ain't real,
and you ain't shit.

48:09.460 --> 48:11.170
[all exclaiming]

48:11.253 --> 48:12.713
[Leanne] Okay, it's fine. It's okay.

48:12.796 --> 48:14.673
-[weeping woman weeps]
-It's okay.

48:14.756 --> 48:18.427
Would you stop it? It's fine.

48:18.510 --> 48:19.511
[sighs]

48:19.595 --> 48:22.681
Norma Toast is safe.
We're good.

48:24.350 --> 48:25.935
Back to it.

48:27.519 --> 48:30.189
...and so then I woke up
in the laundry room.

48:30.272 --> 48:32.984
It was so weird.

48:33.067 --> 48:35.777
Maybe I was gonna wash my pants,
and I fell asleep.

48:36.863 --> 48:39.949
I think I need to start
taking vitamins, or...

48:40.032 --> 48:42.952
stop taking Ambien.
Something.

48:43.953 --> 48:47.164
Ooh, there's... There's an underpass
down Broad Street.

48:47.248 --> 48:49.959
It's a good spot.
Take a left up here.

48:50.042 --> 48:51.502
I don't feel very good.

48:51.585 --> 48:53.295
It's all right,
I'll make you feel better.

48:53.379 --> 48:55.839
No, my, my head.
It's, like, it's banging right now.

48:55.923 --> 48:57.424
It must be my lady time.

48:57.508 --> 49:00.219
[scoffs] Ain't nothing sexy about that.

49:01.178 --> 49:03.430
It doesn't bother me.
I kind of like it.

49:04.681 --> 49:07.643
Right here.
Take this left, right here.

49:07.726 --> 49:09.979
Hey, what are you doing?
I told you to make that left.

49:10.062 --> 49:11.688
What's the matter with you?
You want...

49:11.772 --> 49:12.856
You want me to get a little rough?

49:12.940 --> 49:15.442
Is that it? A little roleplay?
You into that?

49:16.360 --> 49:17.403
[breathing heavily]

49:17.486 --> 49:20.072
Something's really wrong, like,

49:20.156 --> 49:22.909
like my Nancy Grace ears catnip.

49:22.992 --> 49:25.244
-What?
-Yes, something's... [breathing heavily]

49:25.327 --> 49:28.205
It's like my Nancy Grace
ears catnip bluegrass funeral.

49:28.289 --> 49:30.624
Tiff, are you okay?
What's the matter with you?

49:30.707 --> 49:32.043
Nancy Grace ears. I can't...
[grunts]

49:33.210 --> 49:35.004
Shit!

49:35.087 --> 49:36.380
Ahh!

49:36.463 --> 49:37.798
[tires squealing]

49:39.675 --> 49:41.093
[screaming]

49:41.177 --> 49:43.304
[screeching]

49:43.387 --> 49:44.972
-[grunting]
-[continues screeching]

49:45.056 --> 49:46.640
What the fuck is that noise?

49:46.723 --> 49:49.393
Is that real, or are you doing it
'cause you think it's a turn-on?

49:49.476 --> 49:51.103
-Is that your fucking excuse?
-Oh, fuck.

49:51.187 --> 49:52.729
[Caputo grunting]

49:52.813 --> 49:54.941
-Fuck.
-The fuck.

49:55.983 --> 49:57.859
[Fig] You've got to be fucking kidding me.

49:57.944 --> 49:58.945
[groans]

49:59.028 --> 50:00.321
Oh.

50:00.404 --> 50:02.448
What, are you gonna start crying now?

50:02.531 --> 50:04.992
My dick must have
finally realized who you are.

50:05.076 --> 50:06.077
I did not think

50:06.160 --> 50:09.538
one man could possibly have more
self-loathing than you already did.

50:09.621 --> 50:11.040
You must be loving this. [panting]

50:12.458 --> 50:14.501
Why are you here?
Why do you keep coming here?

50:14.585 --> 50:16.212
"Coming" is the operative word,

50:16.295 --> 50:18.547
which obviously
isn't happening tonight, so...

50:18.630 --> 50:20.257
Natalie, wait. Wait a second.

50:20.341 --> 50:23.302
"Natalie"? Jesus fucking Christ.

50:23.385 --> 50:25.972
I'm here because you're a good lay,

50:26.055 --> 50:29.016
and I relish the fact
that you hate me

50:29.100 --> 50:30.726
but you can't resist me.

50:30.809 --> 50:34.521
Don't worry.
I still loathe you, Fig.

50:34.605 --> 50:35.606
Oh, good.

50:35.689 --> 50:37.524
But you're, uh...

50:37.608 --> 50:39.651
I'm not really close to anyone right now.

50:39.735 --> 50:43.197
[chuckles] Do you have any idea
how pathetic you are, weirdo?

50:43.280 --> 50:45.657
Yes, actually, I do.

50:45.741 --> 50:48.785
I work for a sleazebag corporation,

50:48.869 --> 50:52.873
and I am hate-fucking
a dead-eyed, anorexic crone...

50:54.375 --> 50:56.002
who's the only person I can talk to.

50:56.918 --> 50:58.754
I'm living my worst nightmare.

50:59.796 --> 51:02.008
Then channel your inner Freddy Krueger

51:02.091 --> 51:05.594
and grab life by the balls
with your big, bladed fingers.

51:06.428 --> 51:09.265
Pearson quit over this Burset thing.

51:09.348 --> 51:11.475
-I should too, but--
-Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

51:11.558 --> 51:13.560
-Pearson quit?
-[sighs]

51:13.644 --> 51:15.979
You have the chance for a promotion,
and you're going limp?

51:16.063 --> 51:19.566
[sighs] Even if I wanted his job,
and I don't, it's a lateral move.

51:19.650 --> 51:21.360
A lateral move with more pay?

51:21.443 --> 51:24.113
Yes. It's a promotion.

51:25.739 --> 51:29.035
But I'm not gonna capitalize on Burset.
I'm gonna fight for her.

51:29.118 --> 51:30.161
Why?

51:30.244 --> 51:32.871
Because I wear protection,
so I haven't caught

51:32.954 --> 51:36.208
whatever form of syphilis you have
that caused your soul to rot.

51:36.292 --> 51:38.877
No, really. Why?

51:39.503 --> 51:41.547
You keep on martyring yourself
for these people, and why?

51:41.630 --> 51:44.883
Has anyone ever thanked you
for saving the prison?

51:45.634 --> 51:47.636
Just the people
who are now profiting from it.

51:47.719 --> 51:51.973
Well, maybe those are the people
you should be sticking your neck out for.

51:52.058 --> 51:54.310
Do what you have to do,

51:54.393 --> 51:57.896
or you're the one
who gets fucked in the ass.

52:00.066 --> 52:01.483
Speaking of which...

52:07.698 --> 52:09.491
You're so disgusting.

52:09.575 --> 52:11.285
[Fig laughing]

52:12.786 --> 52:14.080
[both grunting]

52:28.552 --> 52:29.720
Hey.

52:31.263 --> 52:33.765
I heard about your mother.

52:33.849 --> 52:36.185
Yeah. Thanks.

52:37.936 --> 52:38.937
You two good?

52:39.020 --> 52:40.439
What's that supposed to mean?

52:41.773 --> 52:43.234
[scoffs]

52:43.317 --> 52:44.610
You know what?

52:44.693 --> 52:47.321
Let's say our prayers
and go on with our days.

52:47.404 --> 52:48.989
That sounds good to you, little girl?

52:49.072 --> 52:51.283
-I ain't your little girl.
-Oh, I know that.

52:52.326 --> 52:54.411
You don't need nobody.
I got it.

52:54.495 --> 52:56.372
Certainly don't need people
who don't got my back.

52:56.455 --> 52:57.789
Well, maybe people
would have your back

52:57.873 --> 53:00.000
if they knew you weren't
gonna turn it on them.

53:00.083 --> 53:01.377
[scoffs]

53:02.669 --> 53:05.964
Hey, Gonzales.
You took my money?

53:06.047 --> 53:08.300
-What? [scoffs]
-You wanna fuck with me?

53:08.384 --> 53:10.761
You need to step back right now,

53:10.844 --> 53:12.596
or you gonna lay back, bitch.

53:12.679 --> 53:15.599
I don't care what she did,
what you think she did.

53:15.682 --> 53:17.684
You don't get to come here and push,

53:17.768 --> 53:19.686
or you're gonna get pushed.

53:19.770 --> 53:23.690
She saw me this morning
in the library, conducting business.

53:23.774 --> 53:26.152
All I saw you was reading
that stupid butter-bones book,

53:26.235 --> 53:28.237
and I told you it was bad science.
What are you talking about?

53:28.320 --> 53:30.239
You made up a story
about your sick mom

53:30.322 --> 53:31.657
so that I would let you back in.

53:31.740 --> 53:35.076
Her mother is sick, idiot.

53:35.161 --> 53:37.496
And why you think
she's in here on her knees?

53:37.579 --> 53:39.206
Huh, what's the matter with you?

53:42.042 --> 53:43.043
Well, good.

53:44.085 --> 53:45.379
I mean, not good that she's sick,

53:45.462 --> 53:47.548
but good that you weren't lying,

53:47.631 --> 53:49.550
and I hope that she feels better,

53:49.633 --> 53:52.803
and I hope that you both know
not to mess with me.

53:59.935 --> 54:01.102
[slams seat down]

54:02.188 --> 54:03.189
[sighs]

54:26.420 --> 54:27.921
[sighs]

54:28.004 --> 54:30.299
Angie ate Toast Norma.

54:32.175 --> 54:35.429
She thought it would give her powers
or some stupid shit,

54:35.512 --> 54:40.016
and I didn't stop her because
the people believed the stupid, black dyke

54:40.100 --> 54:43.144
who listened to that stupid, yellow chink.

54:43.812 --> 54:46.815
I mean "yellow" both racially
and as a chicken-shit.

54:46.898 --> 54:48.692
Only chicken-shits try to kill themselves.

54:51.111 --> 54:53.822
[sighs] I know you're upset
about the toast.

54:53.905 --> 54:55.616
It was a bad idea.

54:59.953 --> 55:01.872
Norma, I still believe in you.

55:03.665 --> 55:06.752
[shuddering]
Don't do this to me, please.

55:08.504 --> 55:10.381
You need me.

55:10.922 --> 55:12.258
I need you.

55:13.300 --> 55:14.718
[crying] We made miracles.

55:15.386 --> 55:16.553
No.

55:25.812 --> 55:27.314
[breathing heavily]

55:34.655 --> 55:36.615
-[O'Neill laughing]
-[Coates] It's just a scratch.

55:36.698 --> 55:39.200
-They'll probably just buff that out.
-[O'Neill] It's not a scratch, man.

55:39.285 --> 55:42.203
Huh. You okay?
What'd the doc say?

55:42.288 --> 55:45.206
I told him all about the word soup
and white eyeballs.

55:45.957 --> 55:47.834
-And?
-And, you know,

55:47.918 --> 55:52.172
even though it's probably
just a one-time, freak thing...

55:53.089 --> 55:55.175
I ain't fit to be the van girl no more.

55:55.258 --> 55:56.593
[chuckling]

55:56.677 --> 55:58.387
-[imitating epileptic grunts]
-[laughing]

56:00.847 --> 56:03.058
Who knew cousin Sandy's epilepsy

56:03.141 --> 56:05.477
would one day save
your hillbilly prison soul?

56:05.561 --> 56:07.270
You're a really good teacher.

56:07.354 --> 56:09.773
Yeah, and you, apparently,
are a fine actress.

56:10.732 --> 56:11.775
[speaking indistinctly]

56:11.858 --> 56:13.527
All he gets is a bandage over his eye.

56:13.610 --> 56:15.821
[Pennsatucky]
Yeah, but he bled a lot.

56:15.904 --> 56:17.280
Not out of his butt.

56:18.031 --> 56:20.116
Still, I consider that a win.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.242
Yeah.

56:21.327 --> 56:23.078
[Donaldson]
We need you over here.

56:23.161 --> 56:25.706
Hi, it's Maritza.

56:25.789 --> 56:28.249
Aw, shit.

56:32.170 --> 56:33.797
[microwave beeps]

56:36.717 --> 56:37.718
Ah, shit.

56:43.932 --> 56:45.308
[screams]

56:49.521 --> 56:51.189
-[defibrillator charges]
-[gasps]

56:52.941 --> 56:54.610
[indistinct radio chatter]

56:54.693 --> 56:56.152
[male paramedic] Miss Black?

56:56.236 --> 56:58.572
Your heart was in a dangerous arrhythmia.

56:58.655 --> 57:00.741
We were able to shock it
back to sinus rhythm.

57:00.824 --> 57:01.867
You're gonna be fine.

57:03.494 --> 57:05.371
There's no God.

57:06.872 --> 57:08.457
There's nothing.

57:13.086 --> 57:14.212
How's the tat feeling?

57:14.295 --> 57:16.256
It's burning.

57:16.340 --> 57:18.008
Searing, even.

57:18.091 --> 57:20.886
It looks okay.
Doesn't look infected or anything.

57:20.969 --> 57:23.138
It must be the irony, then.

57:23.221 --> 57:25.306
"Trust no bitch."

57:25.391 --> 57:26.683
I don't get it.

57:26.767 --> 57:29.895
You and Alex are the only people
who know where that phone is...

57:30.521 --> 57:31.522
[whispering] and maybe Flaca,

57:31.605 --> 57:32.814
but I really don't think so.

57:32.898 --> 57:34.941
And neither one of them
are getting out in two days.

57:36.985 --> 57:39.320
You fucked me, Stella.

57:39.405 --> 57:40.656
I'm panicking, Piper.

57:40.739 --> 57:42.949
Oh, so you decide to steal from me?

57:43.033 --> 57:45.411
I have no family, no friends and $20.

57:45.494 --> 57:47.120
That doesn't even get me
one night in a motel.

57:47.203 --> 57:48.329
It'll pay for an hour,

57:48.414 --> 57:51.458
which is plenty of time to use your hot
tits and your pretty, little lying face

57:51.542 --> 57:53.419
to lure in a sucker and rob him blind.

57:53.502 --> 57:55.837
What's going on
with The L Word over there?

57:55.921 --> 57:58.674
Thunder from Down Under
been necking with somebody else?

57:58.757 --> 58:02.428
Nah, Chapman's been accusing
people of stealing her money.

58:02.511 --> 58:03.970
Oh, that bitch guilty.

58:04.054 --> 58:06.306
-How do you know?
-She desperate.

58:06.390 --> 58:08.684
I hit her up to see what she was
gonna leave me in her prison will,

58:08.767 --> 58:10.561
-and she taking everything.
-Ooh.

58:10.644 --> 58:12.228
She even taking the Maxi Pads.

58:12.312 --> 58:15.774
Man, Chapman came at me
ready to bash my skull in,

58:15.857 --> 58:18.026
but she gonna let her off the hook?
[scoffs]

58:18.109 --> 58:19.778
It pays to hump the boss.

58:20.654 --> 58:24.450
She let you come back and let
the kangaroo rob her blind? [scoffing]

58:24.533 --> 58:26.743
Girls, this is good news.

58:26.827 --> 58:28.870
She'll gum you,
but the boss got no teeth.

58:28.954 --> 58:30.831
I'm gonna ask for more money.

58:30.914 --> 58:34.000
She gonna donate to the Foster's,
she can donate to Colt 45.

58:34.918 --> 58:38.046
Or should I be saying
"Manischewitz" now?

58:39.047 --> 58:43.301
[whispering] You could have asked me
instead of burgling me.

58:43.384 --> 58:46.888
I'm asking you now...
to understand.

58:46.972 --> 58:48.515
Of course I understand.

58:48.599 --> 58:52.936
Your situation is going to be my situation
in the next six to 12 months,

58:53.019 --> 58:56.523
which is why I started
Felonious Spunk in the first place.

58:56.607 --> 58:58.316
To take money from perverts,

58:58.399 --> 59:00.486
not from people
that I pretend to care about.

59:00.569 --> 59:02.571
I do care! Don't you?

59:04.155 --> 59:07.701
I'm going to make this up to you.
I promise.

59:09.202 --> 59:10.328
[Anita scoffs]

59:12.831 --> 59:14.541
[Black Cindy clears throat]

59:15.542 --> 59:18.378
And as groom and bride
prepared for this ceremony,

59:18.462 --> 59:21.548
they reflected on what it is
that brought them here today,

59:21.632 --> 59:24.676
ready to commit their lives
to one another.

59:24.760 --> 59:26.887
You have your vows, yes?

59:26.970 --> 59:28.429
Groom goes first.

59:31.517 --> 59:32.934
"Lorna,

59:33.018 --> 59:36.605
-I cannot believe we are doing this.
-[both laugh]

59:36.688 --> 59:38.857
In fact, I think we might be crazy.

59:38.940 --> 59:41.943
But we are crazy together.

59:42.027 --> 59:43.862
We fit, and we match

59:43.945 --> 59:46.114
and I think you are beautiful...

59:47.032 --> 59:48.283
and you make me feel tall.

59:48.366 --> 59:50.911
-[laughs]
-And I love your heart."

59:51.537 --> 59:52.746
You're good, Lorna.

59:53.872 --> 59:57.918
"I cannot wait to spend every day
that I am allowed to with you,

59:58.001 --> 01:00:01.004
and then when you are out,
just every day."

01:00:04.007 --> 01:00:05.300
Vince...

01:00:06.384 --> 01:00:09.555
I'm just so happy and honored

01:00:09.638 --> 01:00:12.849
to be Lorna Muccio. [sniffles]

01:00:12.933 --> 01:00:16.394
And for that,
I thank you very much-io.

01:00:16.477 --> 01:00:17.979
[all laughing]

01:00:18.689 --> 01:00:21.357
I'm not a great writer like you, so...

01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:23.569
I have a poem to read.

01:00:25.654 --> 01:00:29.658
"In my life,
there's been heartache and pain.

01:00:29.741 --> 01:00:32.994
I don't know if I can face it again.

01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:36.707
Can't stop now,

01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:38.875
I've traveled so far

01:00:38.959 --> 01:00:42.087
to change this lonely life.

01:00:44.464 --> 01:00:47.551
I want to know what love is.

01:00:48.844 --> 01:00:51.638
I want you to show me.

01:00:52.556 --> 01:00:55.100
I want to feel what love is.

01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:57.769
I know you can show me."

01:00:58.937 --> 01:01:01.022
Foreigner, my favorite band.

01:01:01.106 --> 01:01:02.482
I knew it!

01:01:03.483 --> 01:01:05.777
-Beautiful.
-Yeah.

01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:07.403
And now the rings.

01:01:08.154 --> 01:01:09.155
Vince,

01:01:09.239 --> 01:01:12.576
place your ring on Lorna's finger
and repeat after me.

01:01:12.659 --> 01:01:13.702
Oh.

01:01:13.785 --> 01:01:17.205
"Through this ring, I, Vincent Muccio,

01:01:17.288 --> 01:01:22.377
accept you, Lorna Morello,
as my wife, now and for all time."

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:24.420
Through this ring,

01:01:24.504 --> 01:01:26.172
I, Vincent Muccio,

01:01:26.256 --> 01:01:29.092
accept you, Lorna Morello,
as my wife,

01:01:29.175 --> 01:01:31.720
now and for all time.

01:01:31.803 --> 01:01:33.471
[sighs]

01:01:34.055 --> 01:01:36.266
[chaplain] And now, Lorna,
place your ring on Vincent's finger.

01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:39.560
This is so beautiful.
This is why I don't wanna elope.

01:01:39.645 --> 01:01:42.606
I can't cry like this
in front of my mother. [sniffles]

01:01:44.357 --> 01:01:46.735
Oh, shit, I missed
her putting on the ring.

01:01:46.818 --> 01:01:48.403
Get the kiss, you big galoot.

01:01:48.486 --> 01:01:50.196
Through this ring,

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.573
I, Lorna Morello,

01:01:52.658 --> 01:01:56.369
accept you, Vincent Muccio,

01:01:56.452 --> 01:02:00.874
as my husband, now and forever.

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:03.627
[chaplain] Now, normally, at this point,

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.754
I would have you both
light the unity candle,

01:02:05.837 --> 01:02:09.174
but prison restrictions
on open flames won't allow it.

01:02:09.257 --> 01:02:11.301
Plus, our bride is wearing paper.

01:02:11.384 --> 01:02:13.887
So instead, I will urge you

01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:16.139
to gaze into each other's eyes

01:02:16.222 --> 01:02:18.558
and light the fire within.

01:02:19.643 --> 01:02:20.769
As you do...

01:02:21.561 --> 01:02:25.481
by the power vested in me
by the state of New York,

01:02:25.565 --> 01:02:29.569
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:02:29.653 --> 01:02:31.404
You may kiss the bride!

01:02:31.487 --> 01:02:32.698
Oh, my goodness!

01:02:40.038 --> 01:02:42.874
Ah, they make a beautiful couple,
absolutely beautiful.

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:52.718
Okay, you two can spend
an hour in here together.

01:02:52.801 --> 01:02:53.927
Bell will stay with you.

01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:55.011
Uh, here?

01:02:55.595 --> 01:02:58.348
You don't have a trailer or somethin'
a little more private, alone?

01:02:58.431 --> 01:03:00.641
There's no conjugal visits in Federal.

01:03:01.517 --> 01:03:02.643
I'm sorry.

01:03:06.647 --> 01:03:09.317
-Yes! Husband, yes!
-Yeah!

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.361
-Fuck yeah, wife!
-[moaning]

01:03:11.444 --> 01:03:13.947
Consummate this marriage!

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:16.407
Consummating the shit
out of you, babe!

01:03:16.491 --> 01:03:17.826
[both groaning]

01:03:20.495 --> 01:03:22.538
-[Lorna moaning]
-[Vince] Yeah, yeah.

01:03:22.622 --> 01:03:23.623
[Red] Young love...

01:03:23.707 --> 01:03:26.752
they have no idea what they're in for.

01:03:26.835 --> 01:03:28.378
It doesn't always end badly.

01:03:28.461 --> 01:03:31.214
Oh, said the man whose wife
sleeps in her mother's bed

01:03:31.297 --> 01:03:36.302
to the prisoner whose brand-new divorce
certificate is her most prized possession.

01:03:36.386 --> 01:03:39.014
You gotta believe in something.
Why not love?

01:03:39.097 --> 01:03:42.017
Because "happily ever after"
was invented for the storybooks,

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.520
so kids reach breeding age
without killing themselves.

01:03:45.603 --> 01:03:49.733
So, love is the lie we tell ourselves
so we don't go extinct?

01:03:49.816 --> 01:03:52.152
That's pretty bleak, Red,
even for you.

01:03:52.235 --> 01:03:55.488
Oh, and you caught me
on a glass-half-full day.

01:03:55.571 --> 01:03:57.282
So, you don't think

01:03:57.365 --> 01:04:00.576
there's someone out there
you're meant to be with?

01:04:02.412 --> 01:04:03.830
Of course I do.

01:04:05.123 --> 01:04:06.707
Everybody has a soul mate.

01:04:06.792 --> 01:04:10.378
But they're usually on the other side
of the bars, or the wall,

01:04:10.461 --> 01:04:12.672
or the planet from you.

01:04:13.882 --> 01:04:15.633
That's the way the universe works.

01:04:15.716 --> 01:04:18.219
You're not gonna be in prison forever.

01:04:20.013 --> 01:04:21.765
You got a future to think about.

01:04:22.974 --> 01:04:25.101
Our ships passed too late in the night

01:04:25.185 --> 01:04:28.396
for one of them to change course, Sam.

01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:49.167
Father!

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.796
Father!

01:04:52.879 --> 01:04:55.006
Father!

01:05:00.011 --> 01:05:02.973
God, please help my mother.

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:04.975
[crying]

01:05:08.353 --> 01:05:09.645
Father?

01:05:09.729 --> 01:05:11.314
My mom is sick again.

01:05:13.817 --> 01:05:14.818
Jesus?

01:05:14.901 --> 01:05:15.902
[retches]

01:05:17.863 --> 01:05:18.905
Ahh!

01:05:18.989 --> 01:05:22.826
Help me, please!
Somebody, please! He smells!

01:05:22.909 --> 01:05:27.538
Oh, gross! Get the fuck off of me!

01:05:29.916 --> 01:05:31.376
[Stella sighs]

01:05:35.046 --> 01:05:38.424
I've rewritten this at least ten times.

01:05:41.511 --> 01:05:43.346
I don't know what to say.

01:05:49.895 --> 01:05:51.646
I feel like you're saving my life.

01:05:54.399 --> 01:05:55.816
I came to say goodbye.

01:05:56.734 --> 01:05:59.320
Well, I still have a few more days.

01:06:00.821 --> 01:06:02.240
[Donaldson] Clear the bunk.

01:06:08.454 --> 01:06:09.539
Not you.

01:06:09.622 --> 01:06:11.082
We have reports of contraband.

01:06:11.166 --> 01:06:12.833
I haven't got anything.
I'm getting out in two days.

01:06:12.918 --> 01:06:14.419
Well, hopefully
you've given everything away, then.

01:06:14.502 --> 01:06:15.586
Well...

01:06:22.677 --> 01:06:24.554
-Found a lighter.
-That's not mine.

01:06:25.513 --> 01:06:26.806
[sniffs]

01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:28.474
Marijuana cigarettes?

01:06:28.558 --> 01:06:30.226
[gasps] Wait, wait...

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:32.353
Cigarette cigarettes.
[tisking]

01:06:32.437 --> 01:06:34.022
This isn't even my stuff.

01:06:34.105 --> 01:06:35.773
It can't be!

01:06:36.774 --> 01:06:37.817
[gags] Ugh!

01:06:37.901 --> 01:06:39.694
[Gerber] Where'd you get
illegal chicken from, inmate?

01:06:39.777 --> 01:06:40.778
What?

01:06:41.696 --> 01:06:44.824
[gasps] Bayley,
check out this candy shiv.

01:06:44.908 --> 01:06:46.201
How cool is that?

01:06:46.284 --> 01:06:47.743
[Donaldson clears throat]

01:06:47.827 --> 01:06:49.662
I mean...

01:06:49.745 --> 01:06:51.789
this is a deadly weapon.

01:06:51.872 --> 01:06:54.042
You are so going to Max, inmate.

01:07:13.979 --> 01:07:15.896
Sorry about your dildo, Boo.

01:07:15.981 --> 01:07:20.235
Cost of doing business.
I'll make it up to you.

01:07:20.318 --> 01:07:23.738
Damn, Chapman.
That is some stone-cold shit.

01:07:23.821 --> 01:07:27.617
I don't fuck around.
Let the people know.

01:07:30.996 --> 01:07:34.624
I'm hoping this voluntary
organizing meeting is, uh, code for

01:07:34.707 --> 01:07:36.584
"our union petition has been accepted."

01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:40.380
Maybe he just wants us to pull together
our official list of demands.

01:07:40.463 --> 01:07:43.341
I think the prison should issue us
socks and underwear,

01:07:43.424 --> 01:07:44.425
not just outerwear.

01:07:44.509 --> 01:07:46.511
I want them to pay my college loans.

01:07:46.594 --> 01:07:47.928
You went to college,
and you're working here?

01:07:48.013 --> 01:07:51.516
Associate's degree, Justice Admin, DeVry.

01:07:52.142 --> 01:07:54.727
Here he is, the white Cesar Chavez.

01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:59.107
Today, as you know, is a very big day.
So, let's make this quick.

01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:01.985
We hear Pearson's out.
Are you next? Are they union-busting?

01:08:02.068 --> 01:08:04.862
Or did our petition go through
and he got canned for not stopping it?

01:08:04.945 --> 01:08:06.281
Pearson quit.

01:08:07.198 --> 01:08:09.284
There's a new Director of Human Activity.

01:08:11.911 --> 01:08:12.996
It's you, isn't it?

01:08:14.164 --> 01:08:15.748
Everyone has the right to unionize.

01:08:15.831 --> 01:08:17.457
Shit. Motherfucking shit.

01:08:17.542 --> 01:08:20.002
But I have access to budgets now.

01:08:20.086 --> 01:08:24.465
And all that noise about
the whole shebang coming crashing down

01:08:24.549 --> 01:08:26.676
if MCC starts covering benefits,

01:08:26.759 --> 01:08:28.428
it is 100% true.

01:08:28.511 --> 01:08:30.430
They must have given you
a pretty good pay raise.

01:08:30.513 --> 01:08:32.432
Yeah, like 30 pieces of silver.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.810
I have done nothing...

01:08:36.727 --> 01:08:40.439
but save your asses
since this prison was scheduled to close.

01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:43.943
You're goddamn right.

01:08:44.027 --> 01:08:45.778
It was a pretty good pay raise.

01:08:45.861 --> 01:08:49.782
And any one of you ungrateful,
selfish sons of bitches

01:08:49.865 --> 01:08:53.743
would have thrown me under the bus
and run me over to get the same.

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:56.413
Well, guess what?
It's my turn.

01:08:57.332 --> 01:08:58.416
It's the year of Caputo.

01:08:58.499 --> 01:09:01.502
[Ford] You know,
we had a union captain once

01:09:01.586 --> 01:09:05.881
who told us that the corporation
would call an optional meeting

01:09:05.965 --> 01:09:08.301
and then try to scare us
out of unionizing.

01:09:08.384 --> 01:09:09.426
I remember that.

01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:11.804
He said, "When they did that,
we should say,"

01:09:11.886 --> 01:09:14.099
and I am paraphrasing...

01:09:14.182 --> 01:09:15.183
"Fuck you!"

01:09:15.265 --> 01:09:16.934
[Ford] That's right, because he said,

01:09:17.017 --> 01:09:19.395
"The company needs you
more than you need them."

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:21.689
Now I've seen things from the inside,

01:09:22.357 --> 01:09:23.441
and I stand corrected.

01:09:23.524 --> 01:09:25.109
You're all replaceable.

01:09:25.776 --> 01:09:27.027
Not today, we're not.

01:09:27.694 --> 01:09:30.281
I'd say today of all days,

01:09:30.365 --> 01:09:33.658
the company still needs us
pretty damn bad.

01:09:33.743 --> 01:09:37.580
Yeah, I'm gonna go
with my old captain on this one.

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:40.832
Fuck you.

01:09:46.839 --> 01:09:48.716
It ain't right, Mr. Caputo.

01:09:51.469 --> 01:09:53.053
It ain't right.

01:09:57.933 --> 01:09:58.934
[inhales sharply]

01:10:04.524 --> 01:10:05.900
[snorts]

01:10:13.866 --> 01:10:15.951
Good luck letting the monkeys run the zoo.

01:10:26.587 --> 01:10:30.341
All right, all tools are present
and accounted for.

01:10:35.054 --> 01:10:38.057
All good.
Thanks, ladies.

01:10:38.141 --> 01:10:40.851
Oh, wait, wait. Hold up.
Someone needs to sweep.

01:10:41.769 --> 01:10:43.604
-Not me.
-[inmate] No way.

01:10:43.688 --> 01:10:46.899
Fine. I'll do it.
But you guys owe me.

01:10:47.608 --> 01:10:48.609
Okay.

01:10:48.693 --> 01:10:50.110
Thank you, Vause.
I'm gonna walk them over.

01:10:50.195 --> 01:10:53.281
Yeah, yeah, I'll just be here,
sweeping like Cinderella.

01:10:59.954 --> 01:11:01.414
[door opens]

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:03.541
[door slams]

01:11:03.624 --> 01:11:05.335
[chuckling]
Well, that was quick.

01:11:09.255 --> 01:11:10.256
Aydin.

01:11:11.257 --> 01:11:12.300
How--

01:11:12.383 --> 01:11:14.844
This place would hire
Forrest fucking Gump.

01:11:14.927 --> 01:11:16.262
The guy who interviewed me
was so relieved

01:11:16.346 --> 01:11:19.056
to find someone
who's actually qualified. [scoffs]
