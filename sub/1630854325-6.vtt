WEBVTT

00:27.528 --> 00:28.654
Come on, mate.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.243
Take them off.

00:37.913 --> 00:38.997
Thank you.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.085
How's it going, Dale?

00:43.585 --> 00:46.672
Sit, sit. Nothing's gonna happen.

00:54.054 --> 00:58.517
So, I've come to the conclusion...

01:01.311 --> 01:03.981
that you'd rather die
than tell me what I wanna know.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.149
Yeah?

01:06.149 --> 01:10.362
Like one of those little fucking monks
burning themselves.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.573
Die to make a point.

01:13.657 --> 01:16.743
Well, that's the problem, I suppose,
with smart boys like you.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.245
Read too many books.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.581
Yeah, that's what I reckon.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.207
Anyway, I know when I'm done.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.084
Never gonna beat it out of you.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.294
Bring them in!

01:32.301 --> 01:33.343
Thanks, mate.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.971
One for me, one for my good mate here.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.770
Beautiful. There we go.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.980
Drink up, Dale.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.440
To your victory, mate.

01:50.944 --> 01:51.945
Thank you.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.450
You're gonna get me killed.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.912
Yeah, you know,
for all the dirt-low bastards in here,

02:00.579 --> 02:06.543
the perverts, rapists, pedos,
dogs get it the worst.

02:08.336 --> 02:13.133
Here, lying, tale-telling,
backstabbing dogs are killed.

02:13.884 --> 02:17.429
Dying for your secret,
you kept right to the end.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.975
What would that be, smart boy?

02:23.310 --> 02:24.561
Irony?

02:25.312 --> 02:26.396
No, mate.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.024
It would be murder.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.529
Same as if you did it yourself.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.826
Are you looking for honor?

02:40.869 --> 02:43.247
'Cause I don't give a shit
about honor, Dale.

02:44.248 --> 02:47.417
I've been doing this way too long.
The choice is yours.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.420
You tell me who killed Officer Floris.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.006
I'll have you transferred
to somewhere safe.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.509
Or you stay here, take your chances.

03:06.937 --> 03:10.566
But either way, you're a dog now.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.405
You ought to drink that
before it gets warm.

03:21.743 --> 03:22.744
Dog!

03:24.037 --> 03:26.331
Dog! You're a dog, mate.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.787
Remember the plan.
Don't say anything we don't need to.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.918
I ordered us chai.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.422
Thank you for coming.
Kavita, this is my friend, Prabhu.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.425
He's the one who brought me
to the Sagar Wada when I needed a place.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.968
And business partner also.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.553
A medical business?

04:22.053 --> 04:23.472
Tourist business.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.058
Lin and I are very successful.
He is most popular with <i>gora</i>--

04:26.058 --> 04:29.478
Prabhu, this is Kavita,
the journalist I told you about.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.194
I owe you an apology.

04:38.654 --> 04:39.905
There was a lot going on, and--

04:41.156 --> 04:43.033
No. I overreacted.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.410
Don't worry about it.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.998
I just don't see why you're opposed
to a story that could help your work.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.252
No, I get it.
I'd have felt the same not long ago.

04:53.252 --> 04:56.839
That's why I asked Prabhu to come,
so you could hear it from him.

04:58.757 --> 05:03.929
Kavita, ma'am, this story of yours
on Linbaba, it worries us very much.

05:04.555 --> 05:05.597
Us?

05:05.597 --> 05:06.849
The people of Sagar Wada.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.519
Because we are the "not-people."

05:10.519 --> 05:12.563
And the more we are the not-people

05:12.563 --> 05:15.774
and no one is noticing us right there
before their eyes,

05:16.567 --> 05:18.110
the longer we are getting to stay.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.281
Or I write the story
and then no one dare touch you.

05:25.909 --> 05:29.997
Kavita, ma'am, may I ask,
how long you are living in Bombay?

05:31.623 --> 05:32.875
All my life.

05:33.876 --> 05:36.962
Then I think you are too smart a lady
to be thinking this, <i>na</i>?

05:37.671 --> 05:41.550
No, they will make noise for some time
until everyone forgets.

05:42.050 --> 05:46.096
Then they will punish us
with bulldozers or police--

05:46.096 --> 05:48.015
I get it, I get it.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.934
This city doesn't fight poverty.
It fights the poor.

05:50.934 --> 05:54.396
But that's why I wanna tell the story,
to change things.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.649
And I am saying
we have fought hard for what we have.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.569
Sagar Wada not wanting any change.

06:01.904 --> 06:02.905
Please, Kavita, ma'am.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.283
No story on Linbaba.

06:08.118 --> 06:11.288
Look, I have to live by their rules,
or what use am I to them?

06:18.295 --> 06:19.338
All right.

06:20.631 --> 06:21.840
I'll drop the article.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.969
There are always other stories.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.097
Just promise me
you'll keep up the doctoring.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.809
And if I can help with that ambulance,
let me know.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.103
Thank you, Kavita, ma'am.
This is such good news.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.980
Everyone will be very happy, huh?

06:36.980 --> 06:38.148
It's okay.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.859
I appreciate it, Kavita.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.285
Do you believe her?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.538
No way, Linbaba.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.456
She is rich
and living in Bombay all her life.

06:54.456 --> 06:57.417
She is not caring about the slums.
It was all too easy, this.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.212
Yeah, that's what I figured. Fuck.

07:03.674 --> 07:04.967
I got him.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.264
Raghu Rai couldn't do better, <i>yaar</i>.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.268
So? What did he have to say
about the long-dead Lindsay Ford?

07:14.268 --> 07:15.811
I didn't ask him.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.437
What?

07:17.437 --> 07:21.525
I need time to figure out
who he really is. What he's hiding.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.778
If he knows I'm close,
he'll run, and there'll be no story.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.949
This way, he's not going anywhere.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.121
Come on.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.374
Wow. One more.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.008
How long will it take to develop?

07:47.509 --> 07:48.635
It will be few days.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.763
Would a hundred rupees make it tomorrow?

07:51.763 --> 07:54.183
For 100 rupees? Just tomorrow?

07:54.183 --> 07:55.309
Okay.

08:00.939 --> 08:04.276
You've not had papers for so long.
Why are you needing passport now?

08:05.444 --> 08:07.571
'Cause I can't risk
being in the newspaper.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.698
I'm leaving.

08:10.866 --> 08:11.909
You knew that.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.453
Linbaba, you cannot leave.

08:14.453 --> 08:17.164
Here in Bombay, there is stories,
scandal happening all the time.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.334
People are very angry and outrageous,
and then they forget.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.587
Yeah, I know, but I can't risk it.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.007
Then ask one of your friends, <i>na</i>?

08:27.007 --> 08:30.469
Didier sir or Karla ma'am,
or bribe her not to publish the story.

08:30.469 --> 08:33.054
Yeah, but what if she does
the same thing to them she just did to us?

08:33.054 --> 08:34.972
Then you should ask Abdullah to kill her!

08:36.058 --> 08:38.393
Why are you having goonda friends
if they cannot kill for you?

08:38.393 --> 08:41.188
They are liking it, you are needing it.
This is friendships.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.232
Are you serious?

08:45.234 --> 08:47.194
Only half-- No, no, not-- not really.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.487
Sorry. Sorry.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.822
This is very bad thing to be saying.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.286
I would just miss you, Linbaba.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.599
Please, keep it.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.601
Thank you!

09:31.905 --> 09:33.240
Where have you been?

09:33.740 --> 09:35.033
For a walk.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.118
I was worried.

09:36.702 --> 09:39.705
You're always worried. I'm back now.

09:40.873 --> 09:42.165
How good do these smell?

09:44.710 --> 09:45.711
Sit.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.548
I never used to know
what morning looked like

09:49.548 --> 09:52.009
unless you count
leaving some hotel room at 4:00 a.m.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.886
too blasted to stand up straight.

09:55.179 --> 09:58.682
Now everything looks different,
even the light.

10:00.142 --> 10:03.687
I don't know.
The world just looks different.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.815
Soon we'll have enough
to go somewhere new.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.525
Just me and you.

10:09.818 --> 10:10.903
Where would we go?

10:11.570 --> 10:13.488
Wherever you want.
-No, you decide.

10:14.198 --> 10:15.199
Right now.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.663
I want you to show me Spain.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.373
Where you came from.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
I wanna meet
your eight brothers and sisters.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.588
I wanna eat the food, see Madrid.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.840
You will love it there, Lisa.
-Yeah?

10:31.840 --> 10:33.050
And they will love you.

10:33.717 --> 10:37.054
And maybe I'll even pay back
the money I stole when I left.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.264
Then they'll be happy to see me.

10:42.434 --> 10:45.103
Where is Maurizio getting so much heroin
all of a sudden?

10:55.447 --> 10:56.907
He can't know I told you.

11:07.876 --> 11:08.877
Madame Zhou.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.046
You can't be serious.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.635
She's dangerous, Sebastian. Crazy.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.930
If you knew the things I'd seen and heard
in that place...

11:21.056 --> 11:22.391
You need to stop.
-Hey. Hey.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.894
Hey, hey, hey. Lisa, it's okay.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.897
No one knows.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.733
Her and Maurizio,
that's his problem, his deal.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.069
Lisa, look at me. Lisa.

11:35.112 --> 11:39.867
None of this will touch you, I promise.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.035
Just a few more deals,

11:42.035 --> 11:44.746
and we'll have enough money,
and then we're out, <i>terminada</i>.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.001
I promise.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.989
I'll take it. Leave the furniture.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.866
I'll rent that as well.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.560
Hello, Gaurav.
I like a good game of teen patti.

12:50.229 --> 12:52.523
What do you want? My winnings?

12:53.315 --> 12:55.567
I'm interested in
Minister Pandey's schedule.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.652
What?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.695
Nice family, Gaurav.

12:59.321 --> 13:01.490
Be a shame if anything happened to them.

13:18.632 --> 13:19.800
Hey, Prabhu!

13:21.468 --> 13:22.469
Hi, Auntie.

13:23.053 --> 13:26.431
Because of you,
Parvati spends all her time at the clinic.

13:26.431 --> 13:30.227
Auntie, I never asked her to help Linbaba.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.020
Then listen.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.773
If you wish to marry Parvati
with our blessings...

13:35.357 --> 13:42.072
then tell Lin to send Parvati back to us.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.157
Auntie?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.701
Do you have eyes for her...

13:47.035 --> 13:48.036
or not?

13:49.913 --> 13:52.583
If you could only see her
working with the sick people,

13:53.709 --> 13:57.004
see the joy it brings her.

13:58.255 --> 14:02.009
No, Auntie,
please do not ask me to do this.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.053
I cannot.

14:30.162 --> 14:32.206
We can do this without their blessing.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.379
That is,
if it's true you have eyes for me.

14:42.341 --> 14:45.969
Eyes, ears, and many other parts.

14:47.513 --> 14:48.555
I did not mean--

15:00.150 --> 15:02.569
I want ten kilos.
-Ten kilos?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.196
Once a month. Is that a problem?

15:07.157 --> 15:09.368
You know, when I met you, okay,
I talked to Modena.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.787
I said to him,
"That's the man to run Nigeria."

15:13.956 --> 15:16.708
My supplier will be
happy to accommodate, okay?

15:16.708 --> 15:19.086
Half up-front as usual.
Ten kilos will be...

15:19.086 --> 15:21.547
200,000.
-...$200,000.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.550
And two more on the back end, okay?

15:25.217 --> 15:26.426
It's a deal.
-Okay.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.471
Okay. <i>Salud</i>.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.312
Do you want me to leave you alone?

15:37.312 --> 15:38.564
No.

15:39.273 --> 15:41.108
The night is young.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.359
What about you, <i>ma chère</i>?

15:42.359 --> 15:45.237
You're attracting plenty of looks
as always, huh?

15:45.237 --> 15:50.409
Perhaps a simple, earthy, no-strings fuck
would do you the world of good, <i>ma chère</i>.

15:50.409 --> 15:53.078
<i>Capo</i>, come to me!
Let's get some champagne. One bottle.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.455
There. There you go,
there you go, there you go.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.583
Let's get some champagne, quick.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.251
Someone's making a splash.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.628
Where's Maurizio getting all this money?

16:02.129 --> 16:05.716
Our <i>ami</i>, Maurizio,
has a new connection to Afghan heroin

16:05.716 --> 16:08.218
and is conducting a roaring trade.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.344
How do you know?

16:10.470 --> 16:13.473
He quietly let me know
so I could send business his way.

16:13.473 --> 16:17.477
Mostly I think he wanted me to know
he's big-time now, you know?

16:17.477 --> 16:21.648
But dealing brown sugar
on Khaderbhai's territory

16:21.648 --> 16:23.525
is not a chance I wanna take.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.611
I'll be back in a minute.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.118
You.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.914
Karla, <i>bella</i>, please come to join us.
You want champagne?

16:36.914 --> 16:40.167
Actually, I wanted a word with Lisa,
if you've got a moment?

16:41.543 --> 16:43.670
Sure. I wanna put on
some decent music anyway.

16:45.464 --> 16:47.007
Play me some Stones, huh?

16:52.221 --> 16:53.680
So that Lisa.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.724
What is her deal, huh?
Is she a whore or not?

16:55.724 --> 16:56.975
No, she's not a--

16:56.975 --> 16:58.977
She is whatever you want her to be,
Raheem.

16:59.478 --> 17:00.479
Okay.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.191
I want to add a condition to our deal.

17:04.775 --> 17:07.736
Ten kilos a month, 400 grand.
All good, no problem.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.239
But I get to have a night with her.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.851
You mind if I sit?

17:43.772 --> 17:46.024
We're in the stalking phase.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.821
Who's hunting who?
-Well, time will tell.

17:50.821 --> 17:54.408
In the meantime, look stern. No smiles.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.451
Crossed arms are best.

17:57.703 --> 18:00.414
A little jealousy is a good thing,

18:00.414 --> 18:02.958
but I don't want him to think
I'm spoken for.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.253
You do look very serious, <i>mon ami</i>?

18:09.381 --> 18:10.966
I know what Maurizio's selling.

18:12.968 --> 18:13.969
Does Khader know?

18:13.969 --> 18:16.096
If he did,
that deal wouldn't be happening.

18:17.723 --> 18:20.058
Are you gonna tell him?
-I wouldn't do that.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.852
But he will find out, Lisa.

18:21.852 --> 18:24.188
Maurizio's too interested
in being a big man right now.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.023
He doesn't want it to be a secret.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.026
Unlike you.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.279
Does anyone but me even know
about you working for Khader?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.655
Is that a threat, Lisa?

18:34.406 --> 18:35.574
Just a question.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.243
I'm sure Didier figured it out.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.578
He'd never admit it.

18:41.330 --> 18:42.831
I remember when you met Khader.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.293
That's when everything started to change.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.586
You haven't told them?

18:49.463 --> 18:50.464
No.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.883
I'll keep yours if you keep mine.

18:53.592 --> 18:55.886
And it isn't a secret
if keeping it doesn't hurt.

18:56.887 --> 18:58.263
You told me that once.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.308
These ones could get us both killed.

19:02.351 --> 19:04.019
Promise me you'll be careful?

19:04.019 --> 19:06.438
And if you need anything,
please come to me.

19:06.438 --> 19:08.982
Just 'cause I left,
it doesn't mean I don't still love you.

19:10.025 --> 19:13.403
And I know you can't say it back.
Thank you for still caring.

19:21.453 --> 19:22.621
Love you.

19:26.792 --> 19:27.918
Can you get me one or not?

19:28.710 --> 19:32.506
We had this conversation,
you and I, before, right?

19:33.715 --> 19:36.176
A good passport
would cost a thousand dollars.

19:36.885 --> 19:40.973
Come back tomorrow at one o'clock
with the money and suitable photographs.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.684
Is there any room on the price?

19:44.434 --> 19:46.436
The price is the price.
-Come on.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.605
This is Bombay.
There's always a little bit of room.

19:48.605 --> 19:51.692
Not with books.
-It's rude not to negotiate, Didier.

19:51.692 --> 19:53.527
I wondered when you might turn up.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.905
First, you sleep on my couch.
Now you steal my seat.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.617
Buy me a drink, and I can probably
see myself to forgiving you.

20:01.577 --> 20:05.455
I don't know about the strings,
but he is certainly earthy.

20:06.415 --> 20:08.208
Look, now is not a good time.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.129
We're in the middle of something.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.341
Then I guess I'll leave you to it.

20:17.426 --> 20:19.511
You could not be less French.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.764
Karla.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.309
Karla, will you slow down?

20:26.768 --> 20:28.854
For fuck's sake. Just wait a minute.

20:28.854 --> 20:30.898
Look, I'm in the middle of something.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.734
Come on,
you're the queen of compartmentalizing.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.820
You managed to
turn an apology into an insult.

20:37.446 --> 20:38.488
Impressive.

20:39.239 --> 20:42.492
You're pissed off with me. I get it.
-I'm not pissed off with you.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.579
Look, tomorrow I need to come into town.

20:45.579 --> 20:47.998
Can we meet up? Say, 2:00 p.m.?

20:48.498 --> 20:50.584
There's some things I'd like to tell you.

20:52.169 --> 20:53.170
Please?

20:55.130 --> 20:56.423
What, you want me to beg?

20:57.549 --> 20:58.759
I'll kneel.

21:00.552 --> 21:03.013
Okay, please stop.
-Please? Please?

21:03.013 --> 21:04.973
Lin, enough. Enough. Fine. Fine.

21:06.183 --> 21:07.184
Fine.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.187
Come to mine tomorrow.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.064
I'll make us some food.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.942
All right. It's a date.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.735
Let's be clear. It's not.

21:17.236 --> 21:18.779
But I'll see you at 2:00.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.155
Sounds like a date.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.049
No!

21:39.591 --> 21:40.759
Stop! I will kill you!

21:45.973 --> 21:46.974
No.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.143
Help! Please!

21:58.402 --> 22:00.153
You're caught with another man's lover.

22:00.153 --> 22:03.699
Embarrassing and dangerous.
-Confess to your serious crime.

22:03.699 --> 22:05.325
What crime?

22:06.994 --> 22:08.537
Homosexuality.
-No.

22:08.537 --> 22:09.913
Big crime.

22:10.414 --> 22:13.959
Maybe you did not know this,
but now here we are.

22:14.918 --> 22:17.629
Maybe I can help you not suffer
for your ignorance, huh?

22:17.629 --> 22:19.006
No. No, no.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.090
No!

22:22.009 --> 22:23.886
You owe us big money.

22:37.608 --> 22:40.485
<i>I owed Prabhu a debt for giving me a home</i>

22:40.485 --> 22:42.404
<i>and a second chance.</i>

22:42.404 --> 22:45.365
<i>He was the one true friend I had
in this place.</i>

22:45.365 --> 22:49.786
<i>As I watched him that day,
planning my exit from Sagar Wada,</i>

22:50.537 --> 22:52.372
<i>I realized I loved him.</i>

22:59.755 --> 23:01.673
Who knows what evil things
will be happening

23:01.673 --> 23:04.301
since I am enjoying this gift
from a gangster, Linbaba.

23:04.301 --> 23:06.553
Can't have that. Better not ride anymore.

23:07.054 --> 23:09.097
No, I was wrong.
I'm not having so much fun.

23:09.097 --> 23:11.183
I'm having one very good idea, huh?

23:11.183 --> 23:12.684
Okay.
-Serious idea.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.436
Tonight, I'll borrow this bike...
-Uh-huh.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.104
...for some secret business.

23:17.189 --> 23:19.024
I think you might need
a little bit more practice.

23:20.234 --> 23:22.486
Probably you are
some little bit curious, <i>na</i>?

23:24.404 --> 23:26.698
No matter what you say,
I will not tell you my secret.

23:28.992 --> 23:31.370
Guess I'm just gonna have to
live with not knowing.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.333
Come on. We've got somewhere to be.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.584
I'll drive us for practice.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.002
I'd prefer to get there alive.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.004
You are needing my help, yes?

23:42.256 --> 23:43.632
I am needing the practice.

23:44.925 --> 23:46.093
Get on.

23:46.885 --> 23:50.639
<i>But loving him didn't mean he wasn't
still a royal pain in the arse at times.</i>

23:51.974 --> 23:55.227
<i>Arre</i>! Lin! What is this shit, man?

24:47.779 --> 24:49.198
Good money today, boss?

24:50.449 --> 24:51.533
Yeah. Not enough.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.332
We're gonna have to sell the bike.

24:59.416 --> 25:00.417
What are you saying?

25:02.920 --> 25:05.005
No, what a terrible plan
you are having, man.

25:05.506 --> 25:08.592
No, no, no. I won't do it. I refuse.

25:51.343 --> 25:52.344
Seven.

25:52.344 --> 25:53.470
Huh?

25:53.470 --> 25:54.555
Seven.

25:54.555 --> 25:55.722
Are you crazy?

25:57.099 --> 25:59.935
What are you thinking?

26:00.477 --> 26:02.396
This idiot is saying no more than seven.

26:02.396 --> 26:05.399
This is the kind of idiot
who goes to funerals for food only.

26:07.734 --> 26:13.782
Shame on you!
Nothing less than nine. Final offer.

26:16.743 --> 26:22.124
Don't expect me to come back.
I will shout to all your crookedness!

26:24.251 --> 26:25.252
No sale.

26:26.753 --> 26:27.880
What are you doing?

26:27.880 --> 26:30.007
It is matter of principle, Linbaba.

26:30.007 --> 26:32.676
I will not make this deal.
I will cry from embarrassment.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.136
Just get me my money.

26:45.772 --> 26:46.773
Seven?

26:58.410 --> 27:03.123
Yeah, go ahead and laugh.
Enjoy cheating the white guy.

27:08.003 --> 27:09.963
Why are you trying to embarrass me?

27:43.914 --> 27:44.915
Okay, thank you.

27:46.166 --> 27:47.668
Thank you. Namaste.

27:50.128 --> 27:51.255
Afternoon.

27:51.255 --> 27:53.549
How you going, Vikram?
-<i>Arre</i>, great, yaar.

27:54.341 --> 27:55.884
You see those men I was with?

27:56.552 --> 27:57.594
Managers.

27:57.594 --> 28:00.347
Shashi Kapoor is looking
for a stunt double.

28:00.848 --> 28:01.974
You mustn't tell anyone.

28:02.891 --> 28:03.892
No worries.

28:03.892 --> 28:09.106
His guy's getting sacked.
He broke his arm on a judo side fall.

28:11.567 --> 28:12.901
We can't all be giants, <i>na?</i>

28:13.735 --> 28:14.945
Lin, it's Didier.

28:18.073 --> 28:19.116
Excuse me.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.292
What's going on, Didier?

28:28.876 --> 28:30.377
<i>I've been arrested.</i>

28:32.379 --> 28:33.422
For what?

28:35.174 --> 28:36.216
My own stupidity.

28:36.216 --> 28:38.677
If you still want your documents,
then I need your help.

28:40.262 --> 28:42.472
I don't really wanna mess around
with cops, Didier.

28:42.472 --> 28:44.433
Please say you'll come.

28:47.186 --> 28:48.187
Have they hurt you?

28:48.187 --> 28:49.271
<i>Yes</i>.

28:50.647 --> 28:52.316
<i>And won't stop, I think.</i>

28:52.858 --> 28:55.694
<i>I'm in trouble, Lin.
I need someone to help me.</i>

28:55.694 --> 28:57.196
Motherfuckers.

29:17.341 --> 29:18.884
Didier has been arrested.

29:20.469 --> 29:22.387
Cops want money to let him out.

29:22.387 --> 29:24.014
Those pieces of garbage.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.266
Those greedy <i>bhenchods</i>.

29:28.685 --> 29:30.729
I'll fist-fuck their fucking throats, man.

29:31.688 --> 29:35.192
Cops here, they're not like in the movies.
All they care about is baksheesh.

29:36.193 --> 29:39.279
So you've had dealings with them before?
You know how this stuff works?

29:39.279 --> 29:42.449
Many times.
You have to be tough with these assholes.

29:43.951 --> 29:45.869
Is there any way
you could show me the ropes?

29:47.120 --> 29:48.872
Say no more, my friend.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.587
Karla's gonna kill me.

30:12.437 --> 30:15.649
This place is a bit un-Didier.

30:15.649 --> 30:18.026
"It's the way you ride the trail
that counts."

30:19.027 --> 30:20.028
Sure.

30:27.286 --> 30:28.495
Easy, copper.

30:29.371 --> 30:31.790
Okay. Sorry.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.201
He said the money is up here.

31:24.384 --> 31:25.761
Fucking hell.

31:35.521 --> 31:36.605
How much should we bring?

31:36.605 --> 31:41.276
I will get him out for 3,000, maximum,
or they can lock me up in his place.

31:43.278 --> 31:44.446
I'll bring five.

31:49.034 --> 31:50.035
Let's go.

32:00.462 --> 32:02.548
About time. It's open.

32:07.761 --> 32:09.638
Why are you here?
-I have news.

32:16.645 --> 32:18.564
So good. I'd forgotten.

32:19.940 --> 32:21.525
Were you expecting someone else?

32:21.525 --> 32:23.068
I don't think they're coming.

32:25.237 --> 32:28.907
Someone stood you up? Brave. Or stupid.

32:28.907 --> 32:30.576
What's the news?

32:32.327 --> 32:33.537
Even more books.

32:34.121 --> 32:36.081
When do you find time to read them all?

32:37.791 --> 32:39.418
Our man Pandey is in love.

32:40.043 --> 32:43.130
Deep smiles, big eyes,
future plans, the works.

32:43.130 --> 32:45.924
Her name is Sunita,
and she is not his wife.

32:46.884 --> 32:47.968
May I?

32:51.054 --> 32:53.849
They're checked into
a Khandala guest house under fake names.

32:56.810 --> 32:58.687
Good. It's still here.

33:01.023 --> 33:03.650
I've missed this one.
Always thought it was lucky.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.573
You kept all my stuff?

33:09.573 --> 33:11.408
You never came back to get it.

33:12.284 --> 33:15.287
Did you hope one day I'd come back
and things would be the same again?

33:16.580 --> 33:18.332
Me worrying about where you were,

33:18.832 --> 33:22.044
whether you were alive or dead,
or if the cops would break in my door.

33:22.044 --> 33:23.337
No.

33:23.337 --> 33:25.964
I feel safer with you as a brother
than a lover.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.800
And I am honored to call you sister.

33:30.636 --> 33:33.347
What about my other brother, Lin?

33:34.389 --> 33:36.308
He's not my brother or my lover.

33:36.308 --> 33:38.310
He likes you a lot. He told me so.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.395
Well, Lin talks too much.

33:41.021 --> 33:43.524
And anyway, I'm not so sure that's true.

33:44.066 --> 33:45.943
Was it Lin who stood you up?

33:46.777 --> 33:48.654
Aren't we all meant to be
leaving Lin alone?

33:49.530 --> 33:52.115
Where would the fun be
if we all did as we are told?

33:56.912 --> 33:58.163
What happened to Lisa?

33:59.790 --> 34:04.294
I'm going to tell you something,
but you can't go to Khader with it.

34:04.294 --> 34:06.421
I promised Lisa I wouldn't tell him.

34:07.172 --> 34:08.632
But I'm worried about her.

34:09.424 --> 34:12.594
Maurizio Belcane has been selling heroin.

34:13.136 --> 34:14.137
A lot of it.

34:15.597 --> 34:19.059
I don't care about him,
but I don't want Lisa to get hurt.

34:20.185 --> 34:23.063
Maurizio's a fucking idiot.
And she can't see it.

34:26.692 --> 34:27.818
I'll deal with it.

34:28.777 --> 34:31.071
Khader does not need to know.
-Thank you.

34:34.574 --> 34:37.578
Heroin, government corruption, blackmail.

34:38.453 --> 34:41.373
Once there was no room in your life
for a criminal like me.

34:41.373 --> 34:42.541
Now look at you.

34:48.922 --> 34:50.549
Shame to let it go to waste.

34:54.887 --> 34:55.888
So good.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.519
Just like Clint riding in
in <i>High Planes Drifter</i>.

35:03.061 --> 35:04.479
Fucking deadly.

35:04.479 --> 35:06.982
Leave all the talking to me.
-Yeah, no worries.

35:07.649 --> 35:10.861
Look, mate,
do you even need me to come inside?

35:10.861 --> 35:12.863
I think so. They don't like <i>gora</i> trouble

35:12.863 --> 35:15.365
because of consulates
and embassies and such.

35:15.365 --> 35:17.326
Harder for them to ignore me
if you're there.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.502
Lin, are you okay?

35:26.502 --> 35:27.794
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

35:42.059 --> 35:45.020
We're here about Didier Levy.
-Why do you think he's here?

35:45.020 --> 35:47.272
Come on, man. Don't waste my time.

35:47.272 --> 35:48.774
Do you know my family?

35:49.483 --> 35:50.776
I'm sorry. I don't.

35:50.776 --> 35:52.903
You do. You just don't know it yet.

35:52.903 --> 35:55.072
You're familiar with my uncle,
Rohit Khanna?

35:55.072 --> 35:57.866
Every telephone in Bombay, he sold it.

35:58.367 --> 35:59.910
His men put it in.

35:59.910 --> 36:01.954
That phone, his.

36:02.538 --> 36:04.915
All your police calls, his.

36:06.750 --> 36:07.876
Yes, yes.

36:07.876 --> 36:09.711
Who is not familiar, huh?

36:09.711 --> 36:11.630
The Khanna family reaches far.

36:11.630 --> 36:15.050
Uncle Rohit is in Europe
opening new telephone clubs.

36:15.050 --> 36:16.718
Fucking Europe, <i>yaar.</i>

36:17.302 --> 36:19.513
The point is
the Khannas have the influence

36:19.513 --> 36:23.851
to make a mouse into a man
and a man into a mouse, if you understand.

36:24.601 --> 36:25.602
Of course, of course.

36:25.602 --> 36:28.146
And I am only sorry to have required
your time and attention

36:28.146 --> 36:29.231
for this small matter.

36:29.815 --> 36:32.109
This should be no problem
for a man as wealthy as you.

36:33.110 --> 36:35.237
$4,000, or we keep the homo.

36:39.324 --> 36:40.576
He's a friend of yours, <i>na</i>?

36:41.368 --> 36:42.911
Or maybe more than a friend.

36:42.911 --> 36:45.163
Are you guilty of the same crimes?

36:46.540 --> 36:47.833
What are you talking about?

36:48.333 --> 36:50.711
Homosexuality is a major crime here, sir.

36:50.711 --> 36:54.673
Your friend was arrested naked
in the street, with another man's lover.

36:54.673 --> 36:56.091
And did you arrest them too?

36:56.091 --> 36:58.177
Lin, leave this to me.

36:59.428 --> 37:01.972
4,000? Are you crazy?

37:02.472 --> 37:04.808
I could buy 20 guys out of here
with 4,000.

37:04.808 --> 37:07.811
Fuck that, man. He's worth two.

37:07.811 --> 37:09.563
It is two for his crime only.

37:09.563 --> 37:11.690
He is a foreigner. There's one more.

37:12.232 --> 37:14.818
And another one because of your fancy hat
and <i>gora</i> friend.

37:15.611 --> 37:17.321
And if you do not pay,

37:17.321 --> 37:20.782
we will take the two ends
of your uncle's precious telephone wire

37:20.782 --> 37:22.784
and apply them
to the homo's genitals, huh?

37:22.784 --> 37:25.329
Okay, where is he?

37:26.830 --> 37:28.457
We wanna see him.
-That's right.

37:28.999 --> 37:30.626
You haven't let us look at the guy.

37:31.210 --> 37:33.170
You probably
fucking destroyed him already.

37:33.670 --> 37:36.131
He probably looks like
dogs have been chewing on him.

37:54.942 --> 38:00.197
<i>There was a taste, thick and bitter,
at the back of my throat.</i>

38:01.281 --> 38:03.659
<i>I struggled to swallow it down
and I remembered,</i>

38:04.826 --> 38:08.914
<i>it was the foul prison brew
of fear and hate.</i>

38:19.591 --> 38:21.009
What the fuck, man?

38:26.890 --> 38:29.017
Let's just finish this
and get out of here.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.493
Sorry that I'm late.

38:46.493 --> 38:48.120
No, no, I was early.

38:50.539 --> 38:55.169
You'll love the film.
Especially the fight sequence at the end.

39:03.302 --> 39:04.845
I have a surprise.

39:08.932 --> 39:10.017
Really?

39:10.017 --> 39:12.060
We are going upstairs!

39:13.937 --> 39:15.898
These are too expensive.

39:17.816 --> 39:20.819
They are perfect for you.

39:28.994 --> 39:30.120
See?

39:30.704 --> 39:34.583
$4,000 fine is little to ask
when you consider the other options.

39:35.083 --> 39:36.460
I was keen to spare your friend

39:36.460 --> 39:38.837
from being fed to the Naswales
at Arthur Road.

39:38.837 --> 39:40.756
Yeah, you're a real hero.

39:43.258 --> 39:44.259
<i>Arre</i>.

39:45.636 --> 39:48.096
Get in here! All of you. In here.

39:50.140 --> 39:51.225
Say something else.

39:54.686 --> 39:56.480
I like Bombay very much.

39:59.316 --> 40:00.943
Very good!

40:00.943 --> 40:02.819
The <i>gora</i> speaks Marathi!

40:02.819 --> 40:03.904
Keep going.

40:05.781 --> 40:10.536
My country is New Zealand.
I am living in Colaba now.

40:19.962 --> 40:20.963
You!

40:21.713 --> 40:24.258
What is this motherfucker doing here?
-What is the problem?

40:24.258 --> 40:26.385
This is the <i>gora</i>
who kicked me in the balls.

40:26.385 --> 40:28.345
You have your money.
We'd like to be going now.

40:28.345 --> 40:29.429
He's not going anywhere.

40:29.429 --> 40:31.306
Anything happens to him
and the deal is off.

40:31.306 --> 40:32.391
The deal is done.

40:32.391 --> 40:35.060
You can take your friend and go.
This is new business.

40:35.936 --> 40:37.437
I owe this bastard a proper beating.

40:38.564 --> 40:39.857
You're under arrest, understand?

40:39.857 --> 40:41.942
You're going to--
-You're going to follow orders.

40:41.942 --> 40:44.236
Unless you want to be on night patrol
for the rest of your life.

40:44.862 --> 40:47.072
What profit is there in beating, huh?

40:47.072 --> 40:48.907
Shut up and you might make some money.

40:49.533 --> 40:52.369
No profit in beating <i>goras</i>.
Just trouble down the road.

40:54.037 --> 40:56.790
It is four for your friend to get out
and two so you don't go in.

40:56.790 --> 40:58.083
Now that is 6,000.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.585
Five only.

40:59.585 --> 41:00.752
Vikram, leave it.

41:03.255 --> 41:04.673
Hey. Hey, hey.

41:18.020 --> 41:19.730
Hey, that's all I have.

41:20.772 --> 41:22.441
It should be exactly 2,000.

41:24.568 --> 41:25.944
You can take that.

41:27.487 --> 41:29.448
We're gonna meet again soon, <i>chutiya</i>.

41:29.448 --> 41:31.408
Then. Then I'll have your balls.

41:50.093 --> 41:51.386
Do you want anything else?

41:51.386 --> 41:52.471
Water?

41:53.847 --> 41:54.890
Are you comfortable?

41:55.849 --> 41:56.850
Everything is perfect.

42:16.870 --> 42:18.121
Yes, Bachchan, sir!

42:18.789 --> 42:20.749
You tell the bloody bastard!

42:32.010 --> 42:34.179
Thank you. Thank you.
-Easy.

42:37.140 --> 42:38.392
Thank you, both.

42:39.434 --> 42:42.729
I'm sure you have places to be.
I don't wanna take any more of your time.

42:43.856 --> 42:45.607
I'm not leaving you alone like this.

42:46.567 --> 42:48.026
I need to look at your feet.

42:50.988 --> 42:53.282
You go. I've got it from here.

43:19.266 --> 43:20.267
What's so important?

43:20.267 --> 43:22.019
You mean apart from
spending time with you?

43:22.019 --> 43:25.063
What could be more important?
-Yes, yes. Very smooth. Now, what?

43:25.564 --> 43:27.858
Called my uncle,
who's an officer with the CBI.

43:27.858 --> 43:30.652
Asked him if we could get access
to the Interpol red notices

43:30.652 --> 43:32.112
on foreign fugitives.

43:32.112 --> 43:34.740
Without telling me? This is my story.

43:34.740 --> 43:37.284
Well, I didn't want to mention it
in case I couldn't deliver.

43:38.493 --> 43:39.786
I was hoping to be the hero.

43:39.786 --> 43:41.371
Now you're just pissed off.

43:41.371 --> 43:43.957
I'm not pissed off. It's amazing, I just--

43:43.957 --> 43:46.668
The promises I had to make, Kavita...

43:50.631 --> 43:51.924
All right, thank you.

43:55.427 --> 43:57.179
Doesn't mean
I'm gonna sleep with you tonight.

44:02.518 --> 44:05.062
Perfect. Thank you. <i>Grazie</i>.

44:05.604 --> 44:08.524
Just put the bottle there. Thank you.
-Are we celebrating something?

44:10.025 --> 44:12.653
Maybe. But that depends on you.

44:14.404 --> 44:16.365
I have a favor to ask.

44:16.365 --> 44:18.408
Well, we both have a favor to ask.

44:19.910 --> 44:23.622
It's up to you, but it would go a long way
to sealing our deal with Raheem.

44:25.958 --> 44:27.835
You know, we all have to do our part.

44:28.585 --> 44:29.837
You want me to fuck him.

44:31.296 --> 44:32.714
He wants you to fuck him.

44:33.507 --> 44:36.009
No, the guy, he can't take
his eyes off you. You know that.

44:36.009 --> 44:39.638
You can say no, if you want.

44:40.806 --> 44:42.099
I can say no?

44:51.275 --> 44:54.903
When I used to do that, I always got paid.
So if I'm part of this, what do I get?

44:56.113 --> 44:58.448
Well, we'll look after you,
same as always.

45:01.159 --> 45:02.286
Give me a number.

45:06.331 --> 45:07.332
Thousand.

45:08.166 --> 45:09.209
Ten.

45:10.878 --> 45:12.671
Okay. Ten.

45:15.048 --> 45:16.091
Percent.

45:23.891 --> 45:25.100
You're the boss.

45:28.103 --> 45:29.563
Okay.

45:36.361 --> 45:38.030
Bachchan, <i>saab</i>!

45:41.491 --> 45:42.659
Hey!

45:42.659 --> 45:44.953
Oi, Bachchan, <i>saab</i>!

45:49.917 --> 45:52.961
<i>Arre</i>, Bachchan, <i>saab! Okay!</i>

46:04.431 --> 46:06.016
Come, Parvati, you must join me!

46:07.726 --> 46:09.019
Parvati?

46:10.270 --> 46:11.522
Parvati!

46:11.522 --> 46:13.065
Parvati.

46:13.065 --> 46:14.650
Someone get a doctor!

46:28.872 --> 46:30.541
<i>I knew that look of shock.</i>

46:31.625 --> 46:33.502
<i>No beatings I'd ever suffered</i>

46:33.502 --> 46:37.756
<i>were as savage as those from uniformed men
paid to enforce the law.</i>

46:38.882 --> 46:41.802
<i>I knew it wasn't the pain
of their violence that broke you,</i>

46:42.386 --> 46:47.182
<i>but the helplessness,
the utter feeling of being alone.</i>

46:48.559 --> 46:50.853
<i>I was determined to never go back.</i>

46:51.353 --> 46:54.231
<i>But now,
my escape was going to have to wait.</i>

46:55.524 --> 46:57.818
<i>And I didn't know
how much time I had left.</i>

47:10.622 --> 47:12.875
This is so embarrassing.

47:13.876 --> 47:15.252
What the fuck happened?

47:18.589 --> 47:21.758
Young Alain neglected to mention
he has an Indian lover,

47:21.758 --> 47:25.512
and the man came home
while we were in flagrante.

47:26.555 --> 47:28.098
I learned how fast I could run.

47:29.600 --> 47:34.229
<i>Et voilà</i>, you are at my feet
like the Magdalene herself.

47:34.897 --> 47:37.274
Yeah, those bastards
really did a number on you.

47:37.941 --> 47:40.110
They despise my kind.

47:42.196 --> 47:44.114
So, why did they only arrest you?

47:45.032 --> 47:46.491
He was a Maharashtrian. I am not.

47:46.491 --> 47:50.078
He was wealthy or connected or both.
I'm sure he paid them well to beat me.

47:50.078 --> 47:52.789
But then you paid them well
so they would stop.

47:53.540 --> 47:54.791
Well, fuck 'em.

47:55.667 --> 47:56.835
You're here now.

47:58.337 --> 48:00.339
This was your Borsalino test.

48:00.964 --> 48:03.091
They dragged you through the ring
and here you are.

48:03.091 --> 48:07.513
No. I'd probably be dead
if you did not need something from me.

48:09.348 --> 48:10.349
Fuck off.

48:11.975 --> 48:13.644
I'd have come anyway, Didier.

48:15.854 --> 48:17.731
I think maybe you would have.

48:17.731 --> 48:20.400
Had the roles been changed, I would not.

48:21.443 --> 48:26.365
I think you must be a very bad man
in your heart of hearts.

48:27.032 --> 48:30.661
Only a wicked man
can derive such benefits from good works.

48:33.205 --> 48:34.831
You're my friend.

48:35.499 --> 48:37.084
Even if you don't want any.

48:38.502 --> 48:41.922
One who owes you.
And I will start with your passport.

48:42.756 --> 48:45.092
Yeah, well,
there's a slight problem with that.

48:45.884 --> 48:47.010
I raised the money,

48:47.010 --> 48:50.055
but then those cops took it off me
along with yours.

48:50.055 --> 48:52.349
I'll cover it. It's the least I can do.

48:52.349 --> 48:53.767
Did you get the photos?

49:00.899 --> 49:04.987
I assume the need of a passport
means that you are leaving Bombay?

49:07.155 --> 49:11.660
Can a friend ask why the sudden need?

49:18.041 --> 49:21.170
Kavita is sniffing around
a story about me.

49:22.963 --> 49:26.300
My own fault
for running my mouth at Reynaldo's.

49:28.135 --> 49:29.344
I like Kavita.

49:30.179 --> 49:33.682
But yes, for sure,
she's desperate to make her mark.

49:35.100 --> 49:36.727
It will be ready in two days.

49:38.395 --> 49:39.646
My promise.

49:41.732 --> 49:44.985
Thank you.
-The thanks are to you.

49:45.861 --> 49:46.945
Truly.

49:51.158 --> 49:52.367
I'll miss you, Lin.

49:55.954 --> 49:57.247
Likewise.

49:58.624 --> 50:00.042
To friendship.

50:07.883 --> 50:10.302
Almost home.

50:10.802 --> 50:12.429
Just a few more moments.

50:14.723 --> 50:16.058
Auntie!

50:17.309 --> 50:18.977
Please pardon me!

50:18.977 --> 50:23.315
It was all my fault. Do not blame Parvati.

50:25.025 --> 50:27.069
Where is the <i>gora</i> doctor?

50:27.778 --> 50:28.779
Lin? I don't know...

50:28.779 --> 50:30.739
When we need him? Where is he?

50:33.450 --> 50:34.952
Go find him!

50:34.952 --> 50:38.121
Many people are ill,
and no one knows where he is.

50:38.121 --> 50:40.165
Where is Dr. Lin? My whole family is sick!

50:40.165 --> 50:41.500
Mine too!

50:41.500 --> 50:43.460
We thought Dr. Lin was with you!

50:43.460 --> 50:48.674
Where is Doctor Lin?
We need him now. Prabhu!
