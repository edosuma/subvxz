WEBVTT

00:04.421 --> 00:05.546
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.131
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:07.298 --> 00:09.174
Uh, we need to talk
about something.

00:09.342 --> 00:12.302
Yeah. We don't feel like we can
host Thanksgiving this year.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.138
- What?
- Are you kidding?

00:14.305 --> 00:17.099
Well, it's just with work
and the stress of adoption...

00:17.267 --> 00:19.184
...we don't feel like
we have the energy.

00:19.352 --> 00:23.355
Plus, we don't think it's fair
that every year the burden falls on us.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.567
That doesn't sound like you.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.361
That's Monica talking.

00:30.613 --> 00:33.949
No, no. We made this decision together.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.285
She's putting words in your mouth.

00:36.453 --> 00:40.080
Don't you put words in people's mouths.
You put turkey in people's mouths.

00:41.207 --> 00:44.710
I can't believe this.
This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.

00:44.878 --> 00:49.089
- No, it's not.
- It's not? When was she born?

00:50.467 --> 00:53.761
Well, personally, I think it's great
you're giving yourself a break.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.597
- Thank you, Pheebs.
- Sure. It's just as well.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.601
I mean, last year wasn't very good.
I think she's losing her touch.

01:00.769 --> 01:04.980
- What? You are way off, lady.
- Am I? Really? Am I?

01:05.147 --> 01:08.692
Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving
dinner and prove me wrong.

01:09.778 --> 01:13.447
Well, think about it. You'd be trying
to top what you did last year.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.825
You'd be in competition with yourself.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.995
That's my favorite kind.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.915
Okay, we are doing this.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.167
Don't let yourself
get manipulated this way.

01:25.335 --> 01:29.046
Stay out of this, Chandler.
This is between me and me.

01:30.799 --> 01:34.093
We are supposed to make
these decisions together.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.387
Did you not watch
the Dr. Phil I taped for you?

02:32.026 --> 02:34.111
- Hey.
- Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.613
Oh, yeah.
Happy Meatless Turkey-Murder Day.

02:37.907 --> 02:41.243
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
from that bakery on Bleeker.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.163
- Could you pick them up for me?
- You're not making the pies?

02:44.330 --> 02:45.873
No, I don't make chocolate pies.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.584
When I was younger,
I entered this pie-eating contest.

02:48.751 --> 02:51.378
I ate so many that the thought
of them makes me sick.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.255
Did you at least win the contest?

02:53.423 --> 02:56.550
Two minutes, twelve pies
and a part of one tin.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.345
- Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.
- Can't wait.

03:00.513 --> 03:05.392
This dinner is gonna be so great.
In your face, last-year me.

03:06.895 --> 03:07.936
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.771
Um, what's Emma doing today?

03:09.939 --> 03:13.734
Well, let's see, uh, I know that she has
a meeting with her lawyer...

03:13.902 --> 03:17.529
...and then she has to make
a very big poop.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.616
- Why?
- Well, I want to enter her...

03:20.783 --> 03:22.409
...in a baby beauty pageant.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.663
Oh, my God. That's the creepiest thing
I've ever heard.

03:26.831 --> 03:30.083
Okay, but before you say no,
my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.628
And compared to Emma,
she's a real dog.

03:32.795 --> 03:36.757
- Agh. Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.
- Oh, okay.

03:36.925 --> 03:41.178
No. Ugh, Phoebe, just the idea
of pitting one baby against another...

03:41.346 --> 03:44.598
...I mean, you know, and judging
who's cuter just for a trophy...

03:44.766 --> 03:48.685
- And a thousand dollars.
...is something I'm very interested in.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.439
Oh, please, do not tell Ross.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.317
He still believes that what's
on the inside is important.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.488
Okay. Oh, and Emma needs
a cowgirl outfit for the competition.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.407
Where am I gonna get
a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?

04:02.575 --> 04:04.576
- Well, I was thinking...
- Take the clothes...

04:04.744 --> 04:07.287
...off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid!
- Yeah!

04:16.172 --> 04:17.964
Did someone drop the baton again?

04:18.132 --> 04:21.593
Why come all the way
from Kansas to do that?

04:24.347 --> 04:27.599
I don't get older, I just get better.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.893
You know what just occurred to me?

04:30.061 --> 04:32.688
This could be our last Thanksgiving
just the two of us.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.023
I mean, we could be
getting a baby soon.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.651
- You don't know that.
- Somebody's gonna pick us.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.654
But we haven't heard a thing
from the adoption agency.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.864
I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.

04:43.032 --> 04:47.160
Next year, it's gonna be
you, me and little Hemingway Bing.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.832
- What? He's my favorite author.
- Name one of his books.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.298
The Firm?

05:00.758 --> 05:04.219
Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's
in the oven. The stuffing is ready.

05:04.387 --> 05:08.557
You know, you always cook this meal
all by yourself. Let me help this year.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.350
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.437
But you don't have to do everything
Dr. Phil tells you to do.

05:14.397 --> 05:19.818
I'm serious, let me do something.
Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.529
Okay, let's see. Oh, the cranberry sauce.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.699
It's easy to make,
and no one really cares about it.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.035
Tell me more.

05:28.202 --> 05:32.873
I'm gonna go check on something across
the hall. You start by washing these.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.918
Not with soap!

05:40.173 --> 05:44.593
You obviously haven't tasted
my Palmolive potatoes.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.765
- Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
- Three tickets to today's Rangers game!

05:49.932 --> 05:52.726
- Dude, I wanted him to guess.
- Oh.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.437
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, they're great seats too.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.482
- Guess where they are.
- Center ice.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.568
Did I do something to you?

06:03.905 --> 06:05.947
- Mm. The game's at 1.
- So?

06:06.115 --> 06:09.993
- Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.
- We leave before it's over. We'll be back.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.954
You say that, but it could take us
a long time to get home.

06:13.122 --> 06:17.334
Plus, Joey could get lost and they could
have to page us to go pick him up.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.796
Dude, two times that happened!

06:22.298 --> 06:24.466
Look, Monica's
been working hard all day.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.427
She didn't want to host
in the first place. We shouldn't go.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.137
He's right, man.

06:29.305 --> 06:32.140
- Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.
- Okay.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.352
And get ready to taste
my very special cranberries.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.897
Or should I say "Chan-berries"?

06:42.568 --> 06:45.487
That's some gentle comedy, dude.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.989
We're still going to the game.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.950
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.916
This is contestant number 16,
Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.127
- Hey.
- Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.670
This place is freaking me out.

07:01.838 --> 07:05.507
I've been watching this guy over there.
I don't think he came with a kid.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.092
But we can't leave now.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.886
There was this one baby, Haley,
who was favored to win...

07:10.054 --> 07:11.972
...she got croup,
so she had to stay home.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.975
This competition
just blew wide-open, folks.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.769
Phoebe, it's just too weird.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.439
I just saw a 1 -year-old
run around with pantyhose on.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.525
Oh, I know.
We should've been more prepared.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.864
It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
our real competition now is Cameron.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.991
My God, they just took her sweater off.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.368
Look at those arms.
Hello, Michelin Man.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.703
- Oh, Phoebe.
- Whoo-hoo.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.414
Come on!
You know what, it's already 3:00.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.709
They haven't even gotten
to Emma's group yet. We got dinner.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.879
But Emma's got what it takes.
She could go all the way!

07:45.965 --> 07:50.051
- Phoebe, you have to calm down.
- Ahem. Okay.

07:50.219 --> 07:55.599
Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state
area are in this room right now.

07:57.643 --> 08:01.354
I overheard one judge say that
not one of them holds a candle to Emma.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.939
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.734
- You heard him say that?
- Yeah.

08:05.902 --> 08:10.030
All right. Okay. All right, let's give
these babies something to cry about.

08:10.198 --> 08:14.034
Good. Let's get down to business.
Emma needs some makeup.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.452
What? No... What?

08:15.620 --> 08:17.871
She's gonna look washed-out
next to the others.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.457
No, I'm not letting you
put makeup on my baby.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.876
- Why not?
- Because I already did.

08:30.092 --> 08:33.428
- Oh! You bum! Get off the ice!
- You suck! Get off the ice, you idiot!

08:34.889 --> 08:37.349
- What a game.
- I know. Yeah.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.852
- I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
- I'm sorry he's not here.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.023
But I gotta say,
I am really enjoying nacho chair.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.693
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more
if you didn't keep batting my hand away.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.154
Oh!

08:51.322 --> 08:52.948
- Yeah!
- These seats are great.

08:53.115 --> 08:56.117
I know, I know.
When I was here for "Holidays on Ice"...

08:57.828 --> 09:02.290
...I was sitting so far away,
Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.

09:02.792 --> 09:06.044
Whoa, we'd better get going.
If we don't leave now, we're gonna be late.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.798
But it's a tie game. So we're a little late.
The girls will be there.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.092
Let's just stay for one more goal.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.760
- I don't know.
- One more fight.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.887
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.893
Where is everybody?
They're 45 minutes late.

09:22.061 --> 09:27.148
I can't believe they're not here.
I slave and I slave for what?

09:27.316 --> 09:29.276
They've ruined Cranberry Day.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.822
- How late are we?
- Forty-five minutes.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.031
- Wow.
- Here.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.449
Yeah. Okay.

09:36.951 --> 09:40.328
Rachel and Phoebe are already there,
so they probably started without us.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.873
We could just slip in, and no one
needs to know where we were.

09:45.126 --> 09:49.129
- You may want to lose the foam finger.
- Oh, no, no, no.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.755
You just want to put it on your hand.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.801
- Hey.
- Oh.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.803
You...? You're not at Thanksgiving?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.805
- No.
- No, we're late.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.266
- What are you doing here?
- We're late too.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.228
We figured we could be late
because you'd be on time.

10:05.396 --> 10:08.690
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.

10:08.858 --> 10:12.110
- Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us.
- Yeah, where were you?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.487
- Well... Uh...
- Yeah, what's with the trophy?

10:14.655 --> 10:18.366
- Uh, well, uh...
- We were at a spelling bee.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.328
And I won.

10:22.079 --> 10:26.082
You won an adult
Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?

10:26.709 --> 10:29.878
Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.713
Let me see this.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.425
"Grand Supreme Little Darling,
New York Division"?

10:35.593 --> 10:38.053
That's me. Heh.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.682
You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?

10:42.850 --> 10:46.853
And it looks like she put makeup on her.

10:47.229 --> 10:51.191
Wait a second. Where have I seen
that cowgirl outfit before?

10:52.568 --> 10:54.778
I can't believe this. She's our daughter.

10:54.945 --> 10:58.657
That you would treat her like
some kind of show dog is inexcusable.

10:58.824 --> 11:02.869
- She won a thousand dollars.
- So this is an annual thing?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.417
That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!

11:10.836 --> 11:13.880
Guys, there are people in there
who are not getting any happier.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.007
- What are we gonna do?
- Figure it out.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.717
I gotta put Emma down for a nap.

11:17.885 --> 11:21.054
And, Rach, while you're in there,
throw something on Alicia May.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.183
- All right, what are we gonna say?
- Ooh!

11:25.351 --> 11:27.060
We'll say that we were mugged.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.729
You can't get mad at someone
who's been mugged.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.065
Good. But you don't look
like you were mugged.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.526
No. Here.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.447
Hey!

11:41.701 --> 11:43.952
Do you hear something?

11:48.207 --> 11:49.249
They're out there.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.835
Let me see.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.255
I can't believe this. They're an hour late...

11:55.423 --> 11:58.007
...and they're just
standing out there talking.

11:58.592 --> 12:03.430
Everything's so distorted.
It looks like Joey has a giant hand.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.392
That says "Rangers" on it.
They went to the game.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.771
Oh, they are in for a world of pain.

12:13.816 --> 12:17.819
- Ross' shirt is torn.
- They're late and they're sloppy.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.449
All right, Emma's napping.
What happened to your shirt?

12:22.616 --> 12:26.453
I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.582
We're just trying
to figure out an excuse.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.042
Hey, ooh! How about this?

12:33.210 --> 12:37.589
We could say that Monica told us 5:00,
not 4:00. That way we're right on time.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.215
Or!

12:39.383 --> 12:44.012
Or we could plant PCP in the apartment
and call the cops on her.

12:45.848 --> 12:50.268
That would be a good way to get rid
of all the PCP we have lying around.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.395
We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.

12:52.563 --> 12:55.315
We'll just act casual.
We're not late, we're right on time.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.864
"We know you're out there."

13:07.203 --> 13:09.204
Who do you think it's from?

13:17.463 --> 13:20.298
Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.801
Well, let's just go in there
and face them.

13:22.968 --> 13:28.139
I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on
Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.

13:28.682 --> 13:32.185
I hate that thing.
It's like a bolt of lightning.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.896
I have an idea.
Why don't we play Rock, Paper, Scissors.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.397
Whoever loses, goes in first.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.150
- All right, I'm in.
- Ready.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.698
Ha, ha! I win.

13:45.866 --> 13:49.410
- What is that?
- That's fire. It beats everything.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.663
Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.248
- Pop-pssh.
- Aw.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.169
Well-played, Phoebe Buffay.
Well-played.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.713
All right,
let's all go in at the same time.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.091
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.596
- It's locked.
- What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.974
When they're having sex on the couch,
it's like:

14:11.141 --> 14:14.185
"Come on in,
my butt is surprisingly hairy!"

14:16.105 --> 14:20.024
All right, come on. All right, you guys,
we're so sorry we're late.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.777
Please let us in so we can have
dinner together.

14:22.945 --> 14:27.532
No, everything's cold. The turkey's
dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.618
Yeah, and there's a bowl
of cranberry sauce that's...

14:30.786 --> 14:32.579
What happens to cranberry sauce?

14:32.746 --> 14:35.790
- Nothing, it's fine.
- Oh, thank God.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.627
Come on, you guys, we're sorry.
Our subway broke down.

14:39.795 --> 14:43.381
That's a lie! You went to the game.
I can see Joey's hand.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.633
For the love of God, take it off!

14:49.263 --> 14:52.015
Guys, it doesn't matter
why we're late. We're all here now.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.184
Please let us in so we can have
some of your delicious turkey.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.274
I had a dream once
about a fax machine that did that.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.903
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.823
- How are we gonna decide who gets this?
- Water balloon!

15:13.662 --> 15:16.247
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.875
Ah, oh! I just remembered,
we do have something to eat.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.419
Monica put something
in our oven this morning.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.922
You touch that,
and you will be sorry!

15:24.089 --> 15:28.509
Guys, I'd listen to her.
The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!

15:30.846 --> 15:32.180
- Ah!
- Ha-ha-ha.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.432
Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!

15:34.600 --> 15:37.060
That's worse than no food.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.814
Ha, ha! All you got was
Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.191
Stinky?

15:43.692 --> 15:46.736
Please let me stay on this side
of the door.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.530
Oh, I know! I still have my old key.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.784
- Oh.
- We can just unlock the door.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.995
I don't know if that's a good idea.
They don't wanna be with us.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.872
I don't wanna be with them either...

15:58.040 --> 16:01.751
...but it's Thanksgiving, and we should
not want to be together together.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.587
If I could just get in there,
make a face-to-face apology.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.507
Look them in the eye,
I could get them to forgive us.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.134
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you...

16:13.180 --> 16:15.264
...I can do it.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.309
Yeah, he can do it.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.938
Oh...

16:26.485 --> 16:30.029
Aw. It all looks so beautiful.

16:30.197 --> 16:33.074
- The turkey, the stuffing.
- The cranberries.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.911
Ugh, enough!
A monkey could've made them.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.586
Hey, listen, guys,
we feel really terrible.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.090
He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.592
Don't look at him. Don't look at him.

16:51.760 --> 16:56.347
Come on, you guys. We want
you to know we're very, very sorry.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.308
Right, guys?

17:00.060 --> 17:02.979
- I feel terrible.
- Oh, so sorry.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.483
But let's not ruin this day.
You've worked so hard.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.737
Let's move past this and try to have
a nice meal all together, huh?

17:10.904 --> 17:12.989
The floating heads
do make a good point.

17:14.782 --> 17:16.867
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.077
- So bad.
- So bad.

17:18.244 --> 17:19.619
So bad.

17:21.330 --> 17:23.207
Okay.

17:23.375 --> 17:27.837
Okay, you two go get the dessert,
and I'll let you in.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.214
Dessert?

17:30.883 --> 17:35.470
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up
the pies. You did remember, right?

17:35.637 --> 17:39.474
Pies. Oh, we thought you said "prize."

17:40.934 --> 17:42.894
Here.

17:45.856 --> 17:50.193
- "Grand Supreme Little Darling"?
- Congratulations!

17:51.820 --> 17:55.490
Oh, my God, you forgot the pies?
Well, I cannot believe this.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.284
You forced me to make dinner,
you're an hour late...

17:58.452 --> 18:01.370
...and you forget the one little thing
that I asked you to do.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.165
Really, girls, not cool.

18:06.126 --> 18:09.545
Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
You lied about going to the game.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.048
You knew it'd make you late,
and you went anyway.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.176
Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.
We said we're sorry.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.888
It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!
A day of forgiveness.

18:19.056 --> 18:22.683
- It's a day to be thankful.
- Don't make me come up there!

18:23.185 --> 18:24.852
It's too late for apologies.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.772
Fine, let's just go.
I don't need your stupid dinner.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.858
That would be a lot more convincing
if you weren't drooling.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.570
- Ew, is that what that is?
- Sorry.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.616
Come on, you guys,
let's just do our own Thanksgiving.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.119
- Yeah, I'll cook.
- Yeah, let's go out.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.703
Hey!

18:43.455 --> 18:46.374
Yeah, you three
have a nice Thanksgiving.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.919
- The three of us?
- Yeah. You, Chan and the vein.

19:00.305 --> 19:03.933
- Uh-oh. I'm stuck.
- Joey, that is not gonna work.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.310
No, seriously. Unh.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.813
- I'm really wedged in here.
- I'll pull you through.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.064
Okay.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.276
Ow! Stop, stop, I'm worried
about damaging my head.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.944
It's a little late for that.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.573
Hurry up, you gotta do something.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.159
All right, well,
this does not change anything.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.411
We need to get something
to grease his face.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.580
- We got turkey grease.
- Bring it.

19:25.747 --> 19:29.834
I just want to say that I'm sorry I
referred to the vein as a separate person.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.295
Here you go.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.423
Oh, that smells good.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.933
- Okay?
- Okay, try it.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.896
Gah! It isn't working.

19:50.063 --> 19:53.608
- We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
- Hurry, I can't feel my ears.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.277
Can you ever feel your ears?

19:56.445 --> 19:58.613
Interesting.

19:59.323 --> 20:03.034
- Chandler, where are your tools?
- Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.372
I don't have tools.

20:08.957 --> 20:12.126
- Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
- I lent them to Ross.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.588
- I gave them to Joey.
- I left them at the park.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.092
I'm finding it really hard
not to mess with him.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.303
I stuffed Brussels sprouts
down his pants.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.638
Nice.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.933
Okay, I have to get that.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.311
Now, when I get back,
I want you and your friends to be gone.

20:30.479 --> 20:34.690
Thanksgiving is over.
The vein has spoken.

20:35.692 --> 20:40.029
- It's really starting to hurt.
- Look, I'm gonna pull on the door...

20:40.197 --> 20:44.158
...and you guys push. Maybe we can get
enough room to wiggle him out, okay?

20:44.326 --> 20:46.118
Okay, so push.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.622
Just a sec. We're kind of
in the middle of something here.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.875
Ooh, ooh. Stop putting things
down my pants.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.920
- Come on, guys, push!
- Yeah, come on, push!

20:56.088 --> 20:57.755
Push! Push!

21:07.933 --> 21:13.229
- My cranberries!
- Man, I got food all over me.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.942
I can't believe what you did.
Monica's gonna kill you.

21:18.735 --> 21:22.780
Look! Look! Look what the...
Look what the floating heads did!

21:24.866 --> 21:26.284
I don't care.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.037
What's going on?

21:30.914 --> 21:32.873
That was the adoption agency.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.543
And?

21:35.711 --> 21:39.797
- We're getting a baby!
- Are you serious?

21:45.762 --> 21:48.681
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio,
and she picked us.

21:48.849 --> 21:52.518
- Oh, my God, that's great!
- That's incredible.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.564
I'm so happy for you.

21:57.316 --> 22:01.068
This Thanksgiving
kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!

22:08.201 --> 22:12.580
To Monica and Chandler
and that knocked-up girl in Ohio.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.629
I'm just so happy you guys
are finally getting a kid.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.216
I know. Have you considered pageanting?

22:27.179 --> 22:31.766
I can't believe they called.
I mean, we're actually getting a baby.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.809
Aw. I know how you feel.

22:35.937 --> 22:37.438
- Really?
- Sure.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.649
I went through the exact same thing
with Alicia May Emory.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.905
The waiting, the wondering.

22:46.073 --> 22:50.493
Then one day,
I get that call from Toys "R" Us.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.454
She was in stock.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.874
That is the exact same thing.
