01:25.320 --> 01:28.000
-Detective inspector.
-Sergeant?

01:28.160 --> 01:29.360
Ah, Durrant. Ian Durrant.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.120
We, uh, we met when I found

01:31.280 --> 01:33.280
that poor lad dead
behind the wheel of his van.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.240
-Of course.
-Yeah.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.040
I was on duty today,
so I didn't get to the service.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.880
Oh, it was very,
uh, appropriate.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.800
Right.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.160
Did you know
the chief super well?

01:45.320 --> 01:48.160
Oh, we went way back, yeah.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.680
Anyway, it was nice
to see you again.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.160
[David]Yeah, you, too.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.520
-Cheers.
-Who was that?

01:56.680 --> 01:58.600
[David]The officer
who found Harry Steadman

01:58.760 --> 02:00.120
dead at the wheel.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.840
[indistinct chatter]

02:02.000 --> 02:03.240
Yeah, people were wondering

02:03.400 --> 02:06.000
if you wanted to say
a few words.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.880
What would I say?

02:08.040 --> 02:11.320
That my ex-husband
was a corrupt officer, uh,

02:11.480 --> 02:13.120
and helped cover up
a series of murders?

02:13.280 --> 02:16.200

[knocking on door]

02:54.840 --> 02:56.240
Are you okay?

02:57.320 --> 02:58.880
Saskia?

03:19.360 --> 03:20.240
Detective Cole.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.320
[instrumental music]

03:30.360 --> 03:34.600
Black male, early 20s, single
stab wound to the abdomen.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.440
They reckon he's been dead
about eight to ten hours.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.160
There's no blood trail
or spatter.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.920
Seems like
he died where he fell.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.360
The knife's in the right hand.
Could it be suicide?

03:45.520 --> 03:47.320
SOCOs don't think so,
they reckon

03:47.480 --> 03:49.440
he would have dropped the knife
as he went down.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.280
Yeah, so it was placed there.
By the killer?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.920
-It's looking that way.
-Any ID?

03:55.080 --> 03:57.800
There's a phone,
but it's password-protected.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.520
There's no wallet.
Just a car key fob.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.080
Billie's out looking
for the victim's vehicle now.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.240
Okay.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.560
[dramatic music]

04:28.280 --> 04:29.400
[sighs]

04:33.040 --> 04:34.040
[car door shuts]

04:35.320 --> 04:36.800
Her name's Saskia.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.440
Um, moved in
about six weeks ago.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.360
The guy on the floor,
did you recognize him?

04:41.520 --> 04:43.920
No. I-I-I couldn't even
look at him.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.640
5'10", black, early 20s.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.640
Yeah, yeah, I-I've seen her
with someone like that

04:49.800 --> 04:52.080
a couple of times.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.240
[Kelly]Yeah. Mind you...

04:55.200 --> 04:56.680
What?

04:56.840 --> 05:00.280
[scoffs]
I've seen her with loads of men.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.440
It's my strong suspicion
that she's a,

05:03.600 --> 05:07.600
you know, sex-worker.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.800
What about last night? Did you
see or hear anything unusual?

05:10.960 --> 05:15.280
Oh, loud music, raised voices.
Not that that's unusual.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.960
She's always,
always kicking off at someone.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.800
Were they male or female,
these voices?

05:22.760 --> 05:23.880
Both.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.280
[Rob]When was this?

05:26.720 --> 05:28.280
About 10:00.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.960
Yeah, I was frightened
Saskia was gonna wake the baby,

05:31.120 --> 05:34.080
but then I fell asleep myself.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.760
Sorry, I need a word.
It's urgent.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.240
[Rob]No way!

05:41.400 --> 05:42.640
So our victim's a serving

05:42.800 --> 05:43.520
police officer?

05:43.680 --> 05:45.720
[indistinct radio chatter]

05:45.880 --> 05:48.800
[dramatic music]

05:54.560 --> 05:57.040
[cell phone vibrating]

05:57.200 --> 05:58.480
-Vivienne?
-We've got..

05:58.640 --> 05:59.960
[Vivienne]A bit
of a situation here.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.160
Our murder victim
is a serving police officer.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.440
What do we know about him?

06:04.600 --> 06:06.800
Uh, Constable Vincent Jarvis,

06:06.960 --> 06:08.800
stationed London Central,
lived with his mother.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.560
She phoned in this morning,
she was worried

06:10.720 --> 06:12.920
that his bed
hadn't been slept in.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.400
I'll visit the mother
before it leaks to the press

06:15.560 --> 06:17.240
that a police officer
has been murdered.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.760
[Vivienne]Shall I get Billie
to meet you there? She's...

06:18.920 --> 06:20.120
She's very good
at the emotional stuff.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.240
-Good idea.
-Uh, okay.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.000
I'll text you the address.
Oh, and...

06:25.160 --> 06:28.000
-There's something else.
-Go on.

06:28.160 --> 06:32.320
Young police officer, black,
stabbed in the abdomen,

06:32.480 --> 06:33.600
knife in hand,
most likely planted.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.920
Does that remind you of anyone?

06:36.080 --> 06:39.640
Police Constable Tyler Bates.
It's a bit of a long shot.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.320
Yeah, but it's worth
bearing in mind.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.000
Mm. Totally.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.840
[dramatic music]

07:04.600 --> 07:06.720
[knocking on door]

07:13.440 --> 07:15.600
Is it about Vincent?

07:15.760 --> 07:18.240
-It is.
-Better come in.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.320
[music continues]

07:27.160 --> 07:30.080
[instrumental music]

07:31.680 --> 07:33.560
Take a seat, Mrs. Jarvis.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.560
[music continues]

07:47.720 --> 07:50.360
We are very sorry to have
to tell you, Mrs. Jarvis,

07:50.520 --> 07:52.360
that your son is dead.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.680
How? What happened?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.240
[David]He was stabbed.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.240
[sobbing]

08:05.160 --> 08:08.080
[dramatic music]

08:10.680 --> 08:13.960
-Sergeant Durrant?
-Uh, that's me.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.320
I'm Detective Sergeant
Vivienne Cole. Um...

08:18.880 --> 08:21.520
Weren't you at the chief super's
wake last night?

08:21.680 --> 08:25.400
I was. My, uh, my condolences
for your loss.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.720
Uh, we were divorced.
It was a long time ago.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.960
Well, I'm sorry I'm gonna be
the bearer of more bad news.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.840
Police Constable Vincent Jarvis
has been found dead.

08:37.160 --> 08:38.640
-You're joking.
-No.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.600
It looks like
he's been murdered.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.240
Now, according to this
CAD report, you were called

08:43.400 --> 08:45.200
to an incident with Vincent
yesterday afternoon.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.720
Can you tell me what happened?

08:46.880 --> 08:50.240
Yeah, of, uh, of course. Um...

08:50.400 --> 08:52.000
Police Constable Jarvis
had stopped

08:52.160 --> 08:55.080
a Mr. George Stubbs.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.560
Jarvis was acting on a tip-off

08:56.720 --> 08:59.440
that Stubbs had drugs
in his possession.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.760
Uh, Mr. Stubbs complained
about the stop-and-search,

09:01.920 --> 09:04.880
so I attended the scene
and resolved the situation.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.440
Resolved? How?

09:06.600 --> 09:08.640
Uh, the complainant
was satisfied with my apology.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.160
-And went on his way.
-Okay.

09:11.320 --> 09:15.000
-And no drugs were found?
-None.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.600
Do you know where Jarvis got
his tip-off from?

09:18.640 --> 09:20.120
He wouldn't tell me.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.640
What did you do about that?

09:22.800 --> 09:25.400
Uh, I didn't go
as far as discipline.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.040
I mean, I would have only ended
up looking like the bad guy,

09:28.200 --> 09:32.040
so I just, uh, gave him
some words of advice.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.320
These kids, you know,
the way they recruit them,

09:35.480 --> 09:37.560
take all sorts
as long as it ticks a box.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.960
I am, um, sorry to hear about
Police Constable Jarvis. I'm...

09:44.840 --> 09:46.360
I'm really sorry.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.520
-Thanks for your help.
-Yeah.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.840
[dramatic music]

09:54.320 --> 09:55.880
Been talking
to Vincent's colleagues.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.960
He was very popular.
They're absolutely gutted.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.880
-Well, not quite all of them.
-What do you mean?

10:03.040 --> 10:06.560
Well, I was talking
to a Sergeant Durrant.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.560
I mean, he said
he was sorry, but...

10:08.720 --> 10:11.240
-But?
-But I didn't quite believe him.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.320
[instrumental music]

10:19.880 --> 10:22.320
[Mrs. Jarvis whimpering]

10:22.480 --> 10:24.840
Vincent got home about 7:00.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.560
Um, he clearly hadn't had
a good day at work,

10:28.720 --> 10:31.120
but he didn't want
to talk about it.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.000
What time did he go out?

10:33.160 --> 10:36.720
Um, well, we'd had our tea.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.520
I watched TV
and Vincent went up to his room

10:39.680 --> 10:41.520
to play computer games.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.360
He was back down again
before 10:00

10:43.520 --> 10:47.200
because we always
watch the news...together.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.200
[instrumental music]

10:49.360 --> 10:51.960
Take your time.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.400
[sniffles]
He, he got a text.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.600
-Do you know who it was from?
-No.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.320
[sniffles]
He said it was from a mate.

10:58.480 --> 10:59.960
He had to go out.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.960
He never came back.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.360
[dramatic music]

11:16.480 --> 11:18.360
According to his mum,
Vincent only ever wanted

11:18.520 --> 11:20.920
to be a police officer,
she also confirmed

11:21.080 --> 11:23.160
that Vincent was lefthanded.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.320
So it's increasingly likely
the knife was planted

11:25.480 --> 11:26.960
in his right hand?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.160
What we need to know is who

11:28.320 --> 11:29.720
texted Vincent just before
10 p.m.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.760
I'm waiting for a response
from Vincent's service provider.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.720
Any news on the tenant
from the crime scene?

11:34.880 --> 11:37.480
-Saskia Dunleavy?
-Nothing.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.080
[David] What about
her friends and family?

11:39.240 --> 11:40.800
[Billie]
Saskia grew up in care.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.560
We haven't found anyone
to talk to us yet.

11:42.720 --> 11:46.520
Right. If we don't find her
soon, I'll do an appeal.

11:46.680 --> 11:49.920
[Rob]Young black policeman
stabbed. Knife planted on him.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.400
Isn't that the same MO
as the murder of

11:51.560 --> 11:53.880
Police Constable Tyler Bates
outside that pub?

11:55.560 --> 11:57.360
[scoffs] But you'd
already thought of that?

11:57.520 --> 11:59.360
Yeah, it struck me straightaway.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.520
But we need to make
a more concrete connection

12:01.680 --> 12:03.880
if we're gonna link
the two investigations.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.440
So Tyler Bates
and Vincent Jarvis

12:08.600 --> 12:10.600
could have been killed
by the same person?

12:10.760 --> 12:12.440
[Billie]A serving
police officer?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.680
The same psycho
who threatened my kids.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.200
If we lock him up,
you get your family back.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.280
[dramatic music]

12:25.640 --> 12:28.560
[music continues]

12:57.360 --> 13:00.280
[music continues]

13:04.320 --> 13:06.320
Either of you seen this girl?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.440
Her name is Saskia.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.160
[dramatic music]

13:16.320 --> 13:18.400
The tech team have got
into Vincent Jarvis' phone.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.640
It was Saskia Dunleavy
who texted him last night.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.040
-What did she say?
-Just one word.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.040
-"Help."
-How do we know it was from her?

13:25.200 --> 13:28.040
Well, she and Vincent have been
messaging the past few weeks.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.880
-In a relationship?
-It looks that way.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.960
[dramatic music]

13:40.960 --> 13:41.960
[sighs]

13:45.160 --> 13:46.440
[knocking on door]

13:47.240 --> 13:49.040
You okay?

13:49.200 --> 13:51.480
Just had the deputy assistant
commissioner on the phone,

13:51.640 --> 13:53.600
not putting pressure on us
to find out

13:53.760 --> 13:55.160
who killed Constable Jarvis.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.080
Well, it is high-profile.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.120
Sorry.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.560
No, I'm-I'm sorry.

14:02.720 --> 14:06.320
Your ex-husband was buried
yesterday. Are you okay?

14:06.480 --> 14:08.880
Yeah. I'm absolutely fine.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.240
Uh, look, Rob's found something

14:11.400 --> 14:14.040
in Saskia Dunleavy's
phone records.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.160
Threatening messages
from the downstairs neighbour.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.760
-Kelly Thompson.
-How threatening?

14:18.920 --> 14:19.840
Downright nasty.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.280
I presume this Kelly didn't

14:21.440 --> 14:22.880
mention it
when you spoke to her.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.720
-Of course she didn't.
-Nick her for harassment.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.800
That should encourage her
to tell us the truth.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.880
[dramatic music]

14:40.160 --> 14:41.680
[tap water running]

14:41.840 --> 14:43.040
-Hey.
-Uh...

14:43.200 --> 14:44.320
Did you get a hold
of Kelly Thompson?

14:44.480 --> 14:46.320
Yeah, we did.
Rob's bringing her in now.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.920
Okay. Good.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.680
I meant to ask,
how was the funeral?

14:51.840 --> 14:55.040
It was, you know, a funeral.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.600
Did the chief super
have any other relatives?

14:58.760 --> 15:00.640
Uh, his parents are both dead

15:00.800 --> 15:04.120
and his sister
lives in New Zealand.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.600
-So you ended up--
-Yeah.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.200
Talking to people
I haven't seen in 25 years.

15:08.360 --> 15:12.360
-Well, how was that?
-Yeah, I've had better days.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.360
When you...found
the chief super in that--

15:15.520 --> 15:18.160
Uh, I know you mean well,
Billie,

15:18.320 --> 15:20.520
but, um,

15:20.680 --> 15:23.240
Jack and I were divorced
over 25 years ago.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.960
But you must want to find the
man who killed your ex-husband?

15:27.120 --> 15:30.720
Yeah, yeah, of course I do.

15:30.880 --> 15:34.200
-Did you go to the grave?
-Yeah, for my sins.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.880
No offence, sarge, but I just
find it hard to believe that

15:37.040 --> 15:41.520
you would watch your ex-husband
being buried and feel nothing.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.360
You know what I felt?

15:51.360 --> 15:53.400
I felt furious

15:53.560 --> 15:57.720
that someone so intelligent
be so stupid.

15:57.880 --> 16:01.720
I mean, there was me, Rob,
the detective inspector,

16:01.880 --> 16:04.720
the deputy assistant
commissioner, all running around

16:04.880 --> 16:09.440
stitching together this deal
to guarantee his safety and...

16:09.600 --> 16:11.360
What did Jack Mulgrew do?

16:11.520 --> 16:13.160
He got himself killed.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.200
Stupid.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.560
[instrumental music]

16:24.880 --> 16:26.920
These are
the threatening text messages

16:27.080 --> 16:29.240
you sent to Saskia Dunleavy.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.360
What did she do
to make you so upset?

16:32.520 --> 16:34.920
Well, she complained
about the baby crying.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.640
Her... The cheek of her.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.640
You-you should hear the noise
she makes all day and night.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.200
Did you see Saskia
yesterday evening?

16:44.600 --> 16:45.560
Yes.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.480
Tell us what happened.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.040
-Well, I went up there.
-When?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.400
About half 7:00.

16:53.560 --> 16:54.960
[Vivienne]
Why did you do that?

16:55.120 --> 16:56.280
To have it out with her.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.400
[Rob]Have what out?

16:57.560 --> 16:59.760
[Kelly]What she did to George.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.040
-George who?
-George Stubbs.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.720
Sorry, did you say
George Stubbs?

17:06.880 --> 17:08.200
Yeah.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.160
What did Saskia do
to George Stubbs?

17:10.320 --> 17:11.800
Well, she told
that police officer

17:11.960 --> 17:13.760
that George
had drugs in his car.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.400
[Rob]Which police officer?

17:15.560 --> 17:16.800
The guy I found dead
this morning.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.520
What, the guy
you couldn't even look at?

17:18.680 --> 17:20.600
Oh.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.880
What is George Stubbs to you?

17:24.040 --> 17:26.200
He's the father of my baby.

17:26.360 --> 17:29.280
[dramatic music]

17:31.240 --> 17:34.480
George Stubbs, property
developer, no criminal record.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.400
I spoke to his wife,
she hasn't seen George

17:36.560 --> 17:38.000
since eight o'clock
this morning.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.040
Hasn't shown up for work and

17:39.200 --> 17:40.720
he's not answering his phone.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.240
He was stopped and searched
by Constable Vincent Jarvis

17:43.400 --> 17:45.840
yesterday afternoon,
and he was not happy about it.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.240
The patrol sergeant
had to come out

17:47.400 --> 17:48.920
and pour oil on troubled waters.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.200
Did the officer
search Stubbs' car?

17:51.360 --> 17:53.760
Yeah. No sign of any drugs.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.840
Kelly's convinced
Constable Jarvis was given

17:56.000 --> 17:58.800
a dodgy tip-off by
her neighbour, Saskia Dunleavy.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.960
Is that reason enough for George
Stubbs to stab a police officer?

18:03.120 --> 18:05.880
And plant a knife in his hand.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.240
What exactly does Kelly say
happened last night?

18:08.400 --> 18:12.760
Um, George came around about
9:00, they had sex and a pizza

18:12.920 --> 18:16.080
and then Kelly fell asleep and
she didn't hear George leave.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.360
So where's George Stubbs now?

18:19.520 --> 18:21.640
And where the hell
is Saskia Dunleavy?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.720
[dramatic music]

18:43.600 --> 18:45.560
That's great. Thanks.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.720
Saskia Dunleavy's
turned her phone on.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.440
-At last. You got a location?
-Yeah.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.520
[Billie]She's in Camberwell
on Glenshade Road

18:51.680 --> 18:53.280
heading for the Ferncott Estate.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.760
Billie,
let the detective inspector know

18:54.920 --> 18:56.280
he can call off
the press conference.

18:56.440 --> 18:57.320
[Vivienne]Shall we
grab her before

18:57.480 --> 18:58.920
she disappears again?

18:59.920 --> 19:02.840
[dramatic music]

19:09.480 --> 19:10.920
Well, thanks for nothing!

19:13.240 --> 19:16.160
[music continues]

19:18.440 --> 19:19.720
[Rob]Saskia Dunleavy?

19:19.880 --> 19:21.480
[intense music]

19:23.080 --> 19:24.680
Chasing suspect south
down Baker Street

19:24.840 --> 19:25.720
towards the estate.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.800
[music continues]

19:38.240 --> 19:39.360
Stay there.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.360
Hold your hands out.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.280
Saskia Dunleavy,
I'm arresting you

19:44.440 --> 19:45.440
on suspicion of murder.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.960
You do not have to say anything,

19:47.120 --> 19:48.400
but it may harm your defence
if you do not

19:48.560 --> 19:49.800
mention when
questioned something

19:49.960 --> 19:51.160
which you later rely on
in court.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.400
Anything you do say
may be given

19:52.560 --> 19:54.480
in evidence. Do you understand?

19:55.520 --> 19:56.680
Come on, let's go.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.760
[dramatic music]

20:03.680 --> 20:04.800
Boss.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.160
Watch your head.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.040
[car doors shutting]

20:15.120 --> 20:17.880
[engine revving]

20:18.040 --> 20:20.960
[music continues]

20:32.280 --> 20:33.840
I didn't kill Vincent.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.480
I loved him.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.320
So who did?

20:44.120 --> 20:45.520
Can't tell you that.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.880
But you know?

20:49.040 --> 20:50.080
Of course I know.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.560
[sighs]

20:51.720 --> 20:54.080
Let me get this straight.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.600
A police officer
is found dead in yourflat,

20:57.760 --> 21:01.080
stabbed with
one of yourkitchen knives.

21:01.240 --> 21:04.080
[David]You disappear
from the crime scene

21:04.240 --> 21:06.720
and we have to track you down
and arrest you.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.160
And you're telling us
it wasn't you

21:09.320 --> 21:11.160
who killed
Police Constable Jarvis,

21:11.320 --> 21:15.080
it was someone else,
who you refuse to identify.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.720
Yeah.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.000
[sighs]

21:21.040 --> 21:22.520
I'm scared of him.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.680
Scared he could kill me, too.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.480
-We can offer you protection.
-From him?

21:28.640 --> 21:29.800
[scoffs]
You're having a laugh, ain't ya?

21:29.960 --> 21:32.760
-Why not?
-Because of who he is.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.360
Okay, Saskia,

21:36.520 --> 21:38.680
why don't you talk us through
what happened last night?

21:38.840 --> 21:41.160
[sighs]
I've said all I'm gonna say.

21:41.320 --> 21:42.840
Did you give Vincent
the tip-off about

21:43.000 --> 21:44.400
George Stubbs
having drugs in his car?

21:44.560 --> 21:47.320
Are you deaf?

21:47.480 --> 21:48.600
[David sighs]

21:50.000 --> 21:51.080
[door shuts]

21:51.240 --> 21:52.760
Do you buy any of that?

21:52.920 --> 21:56.560
I believe she's scared of
whoever killed Vincent Jarvis.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.480
You offered her protection,
she turned it down

21:59.640 --> 22:01.360
because of who he is.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.680
But who then?

22:02.840 --> 22:05.280
A serving police officer.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.360
[dramatic music]

22:15.160 --> 22:16.640
Rob spotted it, so did I.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.440
The MO of Police Constable
Vincent Jarvis' murder

22:19.600 --> 22:22.680
is almost identical
to the murder of PC Tyler Bates.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.680
Now, presumably, the murderer
thought if he could get away

22:24.840 --> 22:27.760
with it once, he could get away
with it five times.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.160
All the victims
were stabbed in the abdomen.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.440
George Stubbs
has just called in.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.800
He's agreed
to come in for interview.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.360
Sounds like he's ready to spill.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.680
Do you want me to sit in
on the Stubbs interview?

22:36.840 --> 22:39.800
Um, I-I'd like the
detective inspector to do it.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.080
I don't wanna tread
on anyone's toes.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.840
No, that's fine. Um...

22:43.000 --> 22:44.480
You spoke to Saskia Dunleavy.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.640
Okay, then.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.880
Um, the reason I asked David
to sit in

22:49.040 --> 22:50.960
is so that you're free to do
something else for me.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.040
[dramatic music]

22:59.440 --> 23:01.120
[George] I was in a panic.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.640
When Kelly called me this
morning and told me she found

23:02.800 --> 23:04.000
that copper dead,
I didn't know what to do.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.840
Slow down, Mr. Stubbs.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.040
[sighs]

23:08.880 --> 23:12.600
Last night my wife thought
I was in a business dinner.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.560
But I wasn't. I was with Kelly.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.760
We know that.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.320
I was sitting in the park
all day.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.960
I knew I had to speak
to you people, but before that

23:22.120 --> 23:24.400
I had to tell my wife
where I was last night,

23:24.560 --> 23:28.440
which meant telling her
about Kelly and the baby.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.040
And how did she take it?

23:30.200 --> 23:31.760
[George]She wasn't exactly
over the moon.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.360
-Mr. Stubbs?
-Yes?

23:33.520 --> 23:35.520
[Vivienne]
Can we talk about last night?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.400
[sighs]

23:37.560 --> 23:40.000
When you got to Kelly's place,
what happened?

23:40.160 --> 23:41.880
Kelly was worried
that the noise from next door

23:42.040 --> 23:43.320
was gonna wake the baby.

23:43.480 --> 23:44.480
So what did you do?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.080
I went out onto the landing.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.960
I was gonna bang
on that Saskia's door,

23:48.120 --> 23:49.320
ask 'em to keep it down.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.040
And did you bang on the door?

23:52.200 --> 23:54.200
-No.
-Why not?

23:54.360 --> 23:58.200
I saw that copper from the stop-
and-search yesterday afternoon.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.200
-The young guy.
-Where was he?

24:00.360 --> 24:02.760
He was coming
along the corridor.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.120
And then what happened?

24:04.280 --> 24:05.600
[George]The copper, he, uh,

24:05.760 --> 24:07.560
he banged on the door
of Saskia's bedsit.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.720
The door flew open
and they both started shouting.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.400
The copper and Saskia?

24:12.560 --> 24:16.480
No. The copper and the man
inside of Saskia's bedsit.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.840
[Vivienne]Which man?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.320
The other copper
from the stop-and-search.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.360
The older one,
the, uh, sergeant.

24:22.520 --> 24:25.440
[dramatic music]

24:26.880 --> 24:28.360
What are you up to?

24:28.520 --> 24:30.320
Vivienne's asked me
to do some digging.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.440
She spoke to the uniformed
sergeant who was called out

24:32.600 --> 24:35.120
to the George Stubbs
stop-and-search yesterday.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.960
She feels something
about the sergeant isn't right.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.800
What's this sergeant's name?

24:39.960 --> 24:41.600
Ian Durrant.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.680
[intense music]

25:04.200 --> 25:07.120
[dramatic music]

25:24.680 --> 25:27.600
[music continues]

25:39.840 --> 25:42.000
We know who killed Vincent.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.000
-Hm, he's gonna think I told ya.
-He's not.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.600
Because you didn't tell us.
It was another witness.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.520
-Who?
-Kelly's boyfriend, George.

25:50.680 --> 25:54.120
He saw the killer
let Vincent into your flat.

25:54.280 --> 25:57.640
We also know the killer
is a serving police officer.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.040
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

26:05.360 --> 26:07.920
A few weeks back...

26:08.080 --> 26:12.120
Vincent got called out
when I got caught shoplifting.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.080
[Saskia]He ended up
giving the shop manager 30 quid

26:14.240 --> 26:16.880
of his own money just to forget
about the whole thing.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.080
After that I was grateful.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.840
So, um...

26:23.680 --> 26:26.800
I passed him the odd
juicy nugget of information.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.120
Drug stuff, mainly.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.440
Vincent ended up
with a few decent arrests.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.600
Yesterday?

26:37.760 --> 26:40.640
That Kelly downstairs
was doing my head in,

26:40.800 --> 26:44.280
so I told Vincent
that a man was gonna be

26:44.440 --> 26:46.880
dropping drugs off
just before teatime.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.520
But Vincent didn't find
any drugs on George Stubbs.

26:49.680 --> 26:53.080
Only because he didn't get time
to look properly.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.320
Stubbs kicked off and then...

26:58.400 --> 27:01.160
that other copper turned up.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.000
[David]Can you describe him?

27:05.120 --> 27:08.280
White, beard, fit-looking.

27:11.400 --> 27:15.880
This other copper, how did
he end up at your bedsit?

27:16.040 --> 27:18.440
I think that was my fault.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.360
And I watched the whole thing,

27:20.520 --> 27:22.560
uh, the stop-and-search
from my window.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.320
And I couldn't believe it
when they let Stubbs go, so...

27:26.840 --> 27:29.240
I went and had it out
with Vincent.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.960
In front
of this other police officer?

27:35.280 --> 27:36.720
Yeah.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.160
So the other police officer
worked out

27:38.320 --> 27:40.480
the intel came from you?

27:40.640 --> 27:42.000
Yeah.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.640
It means
he also knew where you lived.

27:50.520 --> 27:54.440
What time did the second police
officer come to your bedsit?

27:54.600 --> 27:56.560
I think it was about
quarter to 10:00.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.960
Someone was knocking on
the door, so I looked through

27:58.120 --> 28:00.360
the spy hole, and when I saw

28:00.520 --> 28:02.680
it was that copper, I just
shouted for him to go away.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.200
What happened next?

28:05.360 --> 28:08.520
He wouldn't go anywhere,
so I texted Vincent.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.920
Asked him for help.

28:12.080 --> 28:16.080
How did the second officer
get into your bedsit?

28:16.240 --> 28:17.960
[sobbing]
He pushed the door.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.640
And it gave way.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.160
[sobbing]

28:24.320 --> 28:26.800
He threw me against the wall.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.600
He told me I was a slut
for seeing a black officer.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.520
[sniffles]

28:33.960 --> 28:36.280
And how long was it
before Vincent turned up?

28:36.440 --> 28:39.560
God, it felt like ages.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.520
But I picked up a saucepan
and I whacked that copper

28:41.680 --> 28:44.120
in the ribs with it,
it only winded him,

28:44.280 --> 28:47.680
but it gave me enough time
to lock myself in the toilet.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.840
And when Vincent arrived?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.520
They were fighting.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.200
I let myself out the toilet.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.640
When I saw the front door was
open, I just ran for my life.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.400
That guy is insane.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.880
[dramatic music]

29:06.680 --> 29:08.320
This Sergeant Ian Durrant,
I'm-I'm sure

29:08.480 --> 29:09.440
I've seen him somewhere before.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.280
You have, we think

29:11.440 --> 29:12.880
he's the one
that threatened your kids.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.640
Of course.
Of course, that's him.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.160
Durrant was the officer
who found Harry Steadman dead.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.320
Yeah, except he didn't find
him dead. He killed him.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.360
He killed all of them.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.440
[dramatic music]

29:29.000 --> 29:30.760
Durrant went off duty
just over an hour ago,

29:30.920 --> 29:32.840
reported himself sick,
his patrol car

29:33.000 --> 29:34.920
is still in the yard
of his police station.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.480
The deputy
assistant commissioner

29:36.640 --> 29:38.560
sends her congratulations.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.200
This team managed to ID Durrant
when nobody else did.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.720
-But?
-But...

29:42.880 --> 29:45.320
She's tasked
the Serious Crime Manhunt Unit

29:45.480 --> 29:47.200
to track Durrant down
and arrest him.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.080
Well, it makes sense, I mean,

29:49.240 --> 29:50.840
manhunts are hardly
our skillset.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.520
-So what do we do now?
-We continue...

29:52.680 --> 29:54.880
With the investigation into
Police Constable Jarvis' murder.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.360
Which means we continue
to investigate Ian Durrant,

29:57.520 --> 29:59.480
so we can search his flat.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.440
[dramatic music]

30:12.760 --> 30:15.120
Detective Constables Rob Brady
and Billie Fitzgerald.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.320
We're leading the search.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.600
[indistinct chatter]

30:25.360 --> 30:27.080
[intense music]

30:29.280 --> 30:32.560
[Billie]
You need to see this.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.120
This is from the Evidence Store,
according to the label

30:35.280 --> 30:36.880
there should be a gun
and bullets inside it.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.720
So Durrant is armed? Call it in.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.800
[music continues]

30:53.360 --> 30:56.320
I was a uniformed constable
during the riots.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.200
What was it like?

30:58.360 --> 31:00.360
Not exactly a bundle of laughs.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.360
Do you reckon
Durrant took these?

31:05.840 --> 31:07.240
[Rob]Looks like it.

31:13.680 --> 31:14.560
Billie?

31:14.720 --> 31:17.640
[dramatic music]

31:19.200 --> 31:21.680
Obviously, he didn't go down
the digital route.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.280
[Billie]Look at these.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.600
That's the deputy
assistant commissioner.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.640
Why is Durrant
taking pictures of her?

31:28.800 --> 31:31.720
[dramatic music]

31:33.600 --> 31:35.200
We've got a serious problem.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.240
Rob and Billie think
that Durrant's next target

31:37.400 --> 31:38.920
is the deputy
assistant commissioner.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.080
-Why do they think that?
-Well...

31:40.240 --> 31:42.320
His flat
is full of photos of her.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.920
He also booked a gun at the
property store earlier today,

31:45.080 --> 31:46.920
just before he went off sick.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.120
I've got
the DAC's mobile number.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.440
Durrant's first victim
was a black police officer.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.360
Vincent Jarvis
was also a black police officer.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.200
[Billie]The deputy assistant
commissioner

31:59.360 --> 32:00.680
is a black police officer.

32:00.840 --> 32:01.960
We need to do something.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.480
We shouldn't
just be standing here.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.560
[dramatic music]

32:12.240 --> 32:15.160
[intense music]

32:17.480 --> 32:18.520
[door shuts]

32:21.320 --> 32:24.240
[music continues]

32:33.000 --> 32:34.920
That was the deputy assistant
commissioner's office.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.600
They think
she's turned off her mobile

32:36.760 --> 32:39.080
because she's visiting
Vincent Jarvis' mother.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.640
Let Rob know. He's much closer.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.200
I'll organize armed backup.

32:43.360 --> 32:46.280
[intense music]

32:50.560 --> 32:52.520
That's Durrant's car.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.680
[Rob] He's in the driver's seat.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.080
Shouldn't we wait
for armed backup?

32:56.240 --> 32:58.160
Find out how far away they are.

32:58.320 --> 32:59.680
What are you gonna do?

32:59.840 --> 33:02.000
I'm gonna stop him from killing
anymore police officers.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.080
[intense music]

33:20.720 --> 33:21.840
Stop!

33:23.840 --> 33:26.760
[music continues]

33:28.760 --> 33:29.840
[gunshot]

33:37.600 --> 33:41.120
[panting]
You, in that uniform...

33:41.280 --> 33:43.520
[panting]
it's an insult.

33:45.920 --> 33:46.880
And it ends now.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.840
[intense music]

33:50.000 --> 33:52.840
[groans]

33:53.000 --> 33:54.880
[Durrant groaning]

33:56.480 --> 33:58.320
Do you wanna arrest him?

33:58.480 --> 34:01.000
[panting]

34:01.160 --> 34:03.440
Ian Durrant,
I'm arresting you on suspicion

34:03.600 --> 34:05.640
of the murder
of Police Constable Tyler Bates,

34:05.800 --> 34:08.440
Grace Harper, Harry Steadman,

34:08.600 --> 34:10.800
Chief Superintendent
Jack Mulgrew

34:10.960 --> 34:13.000
and Police Constable
Vincent Jarvis.

34:13.160 --> 34:15.280
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

34:15.440 --> 34:16.880
if you do not mention
when questioned something

34:17.040 --> 34:18.000
which you later
rely on in court.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.240
Anything you do say may be given

34:19.400 --> 34:22.520
in evidence. Do you understand?

34:22.680 --> 34:24.920
Come on, let's get him up.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.600
[groans]

34:26.760 --> 34:29.640
[all panting]

34:29.800 --> 34:31.520
Come on, then.

34:31.680 --> 34:34.840
You were supposed to wait.
You got shot at.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.040
He missed.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.120
Besides,
I didn't need armed backup.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.720
-I just saw an opportunity.
-Great work, Billie.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.640
The deputy assistant
commissioner's gone back

34:44.800 --> 34:46.280
to write up her statement.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.520
She wants to buy us all
a drink later.

34:48.680 --> 34:51.160
Can it wait? Now that
Durrant's in custody...

34:51.320 --> 34:53.840
-I just wanna see my kids.
-Yeah, of course.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.720
[instrumental music]

35:07.640 --> 35:09.160
You know, I'm really glad
that it was you and Rob

35:09.320 --> 35:11.080
that finally arrested Durrant.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.120
Because of the colour
of our skin?

35:16.280 --> 35:18.440
Is that the wrong thing to say?

35:18.600 --> 35:19.920
[chuckles]

35:20.080 --> 35:22.200
No. You're right.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.960
There is a certain satisfaction
in locking him up.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.080
[Rob] There's plenty more
to take his place.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.720
What, in the police?

35:29.880 --> 35:32.440
Most of them just hide it better
than Durrant did.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.960
I just heard from HQ,
Durrant will only agree to talk

35:37.120 --> 35:38.960
to one police officer.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.160
[instrumental music]

35:42.320 --> 35:44.000
You can say no.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.680
-Of course I can't.
-I'll drive you.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.760
[intense music]

36:08.280 --> 36:09.400
[door shuts]

36:12.840 --> 36:14.240
Mrs. Mulgrew.

36:15.360 --> 36:17.440
Detective Sergeant Cole.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.800
He never stopped talking
about you, you know?

36:22.960 --> 36:24.680
Good friends, were you?

36:24.840 --> 36:26.680
The best.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.720
Is that why you killed him?

36:28.880 --> 36:31.840
You know, you got a reputation

36:32.000 --> 36:34.520
for being
a seriously gifted detective.

36:34.680 --> 36:38.120
Old-school. You started
in uniform, worked your way up.

36:39.160 --> 36:41.840
You must really resent it.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.640
Resent what?

36:44.800 --> 36:46.920
Well, they'll let anyone in now,

36:47.080 --> 36:49.520
long as their skin's
the right colour.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.440
[Durrant]Like that pair
you got to work with.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.960
Oh, you mean the two detectives
that caught you?

36:55.120 --> 36:56.840
[dramatic music]

36:57.000 --> 36:58.480
Shall we begin?

37:10.640 --> 37:13.720
Bet your kids have missed
their daddy.

37:13.880 --> 37:15.880
Not as much
as their daddy's missed them.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.680
What are you waiting for?
I can finish up here.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.720
Durrant threatened my kids.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.920
That's why I need to know
if he was acting alone.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.320
If he was, then I can bring
my family back home.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.200
The sarge said
she gonna ring me.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.520
Mm.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.600
[music continues]

37:42.640 --> 37:44.920
You killed five people

37:45.080 --> 37:47.320
without any help from anyone?

37:47.480 --> 37:49.080
No joint venture?

37:50.800 --> 37:52.720
These killings are down to me.

37:54.120 --> 37:56.080
So you did act alone?

37:57.040 --> 38:00.880
Yeah. Entirely alone.

38:01.040 --> 38:04.440
Really? Tyler Bates
was stabbed outside the pub.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.120
We know there was at least
one other person there.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.160
Your husband.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.280
Yeah.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.040
But I was the one
that killed Bates.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.640
Can I ask why?

38:22.360 --> 38:26.240
There we were,
me and your husband,

38:26.400 --> 38:28.280
minding our own business,
having a drink outside the pub.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.560
We weren't bothering nobody.

38:33.600 --> 38:37.920
Police Constable Bates
walks past on patrol,

38:38.080 --> 38:39.160
recognized
the chief superintendent.

38:39.320 --> 38:42.120
He comes steaming over.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.120
Has a real pop at him for
drinking at the Rose And Crown.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.360
Him, a rookie cop.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.960
That pub has a reputation

38:47.120 --> 38:49.480
for being right-wing racist.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.560
This is still a free country
the last time I checked.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.440
Then what happened?

38:55.600 --> 38:57.920
I asked Bates
to control his behaviour

38:58.080 --> 39:00.440
in front of a senior officer.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.240
-And did he?
-Of course not.

39:02.400 --> 39:07.120
He went off on one, banging on
about institutional racism.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.480
So what did you do?

39:09.640 --> 39:11.560
I went into the pub kitchen,

39:11.720 --> 39:14.160
picked up a knife,
I went back outside

39:14.320 --> 39:16.720
and I stabbed it in his gut.

39:18.560 --> 39:21.240
And you're proud of that?

39:21.400 --> 39:22.560
There was no way
I was gonna let him get away

39:22.720 --> 39:24.600
with speaking to the chief super
like that.

39:24.760 --> 39:27.800
And was the chief superintendent
grateful?

39:29.880 --> 39:31.560
He covered my tracks.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.440
Why did Jack do that for you?

39:38.040 --> 39:40.200
2011,

39:40.360 --> 39:44.720
the London riots
on a sink estate,

39:44.880 --> 39:46.080
your husband, me

39:46.240 --> 39:50.080
and one of our ethic colleagues.

39:52.160 --> 39:54.320
[Durrant]A gang of black guys
charged us.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.880
One of them got hold of Jack.
He had a hammer.

39:57.040 --> 40:00.680
Our ethnic colleague was like
a rabbit in a headlight.

40:00.840 --> 40:04.160
He just stood there
calling it in.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.520
-You saved Jack's life?
-Too right I did.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.400
If I hadn't intervened, those
thugs would have killed him.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.760
-And then?
-A few months later...

40:13.920 --> 40:16.160
I got pulled over
for driving over the limit

40:16.320 --> 40:20.360
and I asked Jack
to make it go away.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.560
But if he got found out,
his career would have been over.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.640
That would have killed him.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.360
-You had him by the balls.
-We were brothers in arms.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.840
No, no. Jack wasn't a racist.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.760
He never agreed with you, never.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.920
Okay, let's talk about
the other murders.

40:39.080 --> 40:41.120
Grace Harper.
Why did you kill her?

40:42.880 --> 40:45.480
[sighs]
She saw me knife Bates

40:45.640 --> 40:49.240
and I had to shut her up
before she revealed my identity.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.800
And Harry Steadman?

40:51.960 --> 40:53.360
That was an accident.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.240
That's the one I regret. He...

40:56.880 --> 40:58.200
He was a nice lad.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.880
And what about
PC Vincent Jarvis?

41:01.040 --> 41:02.880
Was he a nice lad?

41:06.840 --> 41:09.440
He never should have been
wearing the uniform, so...

41:09.600 --> 41:10.640
Oh...

41:13.960 --> 41:16.360
You make me sick.

41:16.520 --> 41:21.040
You know,
Jack was right about you.

41:21.200 --> 41:24.960
You really are nothing special.

41:25.120 --> 41:27.560
Well, to hear Jack tell it your
wedding night was a disaster

41:27.720 --> 41:31.120
and your marriage
just fell apart from there.

41:31.280 --> 41:34.200
You couldn't perform in
the bedroom, so what did you do?

41:34.360 --> 41:36.880
Hm? You ran away!

41:39.080 --> 41:40.200
[door shuts]

41:44.240 --> 41:45.800
You didn't have to wait.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.280
I wanted to.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.360
How did it go?

41:50.840 --> 41:53.160
Well, he's admitted
to all five murders

41:53.320 --> 41:56.080
and it looks like
he was working on his own.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.720
Good. Well done.

41:57.880 --> 42:00.560
Counter Terrorism
haven't found any connection.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.640
Look, I-I have to ring Rob.

42:04.120 --> 42:07.040
[dramatic music]

42:11.800 --> 42:13.240
Thanks, Vivienne.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.760
-All clear?
-Yes.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.240
She's confident
Durrant's a lone wolf.

42:19.400 --> 42:22.200
-So go.
-You should call it a day.

42:22.360 --> 42:25.120
I'm just sorting a bed and
breakfast for Saskia Dunleavy.

42:25.280 --> 42:26.520
Her bedsit
is still a crime scene.

42:26.680 --> 42:27.640
You don't have to do that.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.800
I know. I want to.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.560
Go.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.000
[chuckles]

42:37.600 --> 42:38.560
[sighs]

42:38.720 --> 42:40.760
[Saskia] Thanks for sorting
a B&B.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.440
I don't think
I'll ever be able to go home

42:42.600 --> 42:44.120
after what happened to Vincent.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.800
It's no problem.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.640
-Your mate Rob...
-What about him?

42:52.800 --> 42:55.320
-He still here?
-Why?

42:57.240 --> 42:59.920
-I need his help.
-I can help you.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.160
I've met him before.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.880
He doesn't recognize me.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.640
It was a really long time ago.
I was just a kid.

43:07.800 --> 43:10.720
[dramatic music]

43:17.440 --> 43:20.360
[siren wailing]

43:27.000 --> 43:30.200
So what really happened
with Durrant?

43:30.360 --> 43:31.280
He's clearly got to you.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.760
[siren wailing]

43:35.240 --> 43:36.760
He said some things...

43:38.320 --> 43:41.360
about Jack, about our marriage

43:41.520 --> 43:44.120
and his twisted idea
of how it ended.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.640
How did it end?

43:51.120 --> 43:52.960
Um...

43:53.120 --> 43:56.760
We were both detectives,
both new in CID and...

43:58.040 --> 44:00.080
[sighs]
He messed up.

44:00.240 --> 44:03.360
I mean, nothing major, but
enough to get him into trouble

44:03.520 --> 44:07.080
and...he asked me to lie

44:07.240 --> 44:09.320
to cover up his mistake.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.200
And you refused?

44:12.840 --> 44:13.960
No.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.280
He was my husband.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.680
So I told the lie and...

44:24.120 --> 44:26.000
and then I packed my bags
and left him.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.120
Did you love him?

44:32.000 --> 44:33.160
Mm-hmm.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.760
Leaving him was the hardest
thing I have ever done.

44:38.920 --> 44:40.400
[sobbing]

44:44.040 --> 44:45.400
[sighs]

44:45.560 --> 44:48.280
Is that surprising

44:48.440 --> 44:49.920
that I've loved?

44:51.200 --> 44:53.320
Once upon a time maybe, but...

44:55.280 --> 44:57.160
Not now. I know you better.

45:02.920 --> 45:05.840
[instrumental music]

45:12.280 --> 45:13.520
[sighs]

45:16.640 --> 45:17.960
Can't you just, like, give me
Rob's number?

45:18.120 --> 45:19.480
-He'll understand.
-No.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.160
-Listen to me, you stupid cow.
-Take a step back.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.760
If I don't get to talk to Rob,

45:23.920 --> 45:25.680
you lot are gonna have
another murder to investigate.

45:25.840 --> 45:28.800
-Really?
-Well, ask yourself.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.720
You really wanna take the risk?

45:30.880 --> 45:33.800
[dramatic music]

45:34.880 --> 45:37.560
[theme music]

46:07.680 --> 46:10.320
