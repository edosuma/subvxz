00:01.793 --> 00:04.170
NORRIS: How am I supposed
to walk into that meeting
with no presentation?

00:04.254 --> 00:05.585
How the hell did
you screw this up?

00:05.672 --> 00:06.707
VALERIE: It wasn't me.

00:06.798 --> 00:08.789
RUSS: She's lying.
No. We agreed...

00:08.884 --> 00:10.340
Her team had
all the financials.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.008
And we were swamped
modeling them,

00:12.095 --> 00:14.472
that's why we agreed
that you would
do the slides.

00:14.556 --> 00:15.636
Well, one of you
screwed up.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.339
So please try
to figure it out,

00:17.434 --> 00:18.514
'cause when
the client dumps me,

00:18.602 --> 00:20.012
I need to know
who to fire.

00:20.103 --> 00:23.095
l confirmed in the e-mail.
Hold on. Here.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.356
NORRIS: She did tell you
about it, Russ.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.742
I never got this.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.825
Russ, are you okay?

00:40.916 --> 00:42.372
(GASPS)

00:42.459 --> 00:43.915
Are you drunk?

00:44.002 --> 00:45.538
I'm not drunk.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.085
(EXCLAIMING)

00:51.635 --> 00:53.466
I'm not drunk. I'm...

00:57.641 --> 01:00.257
I had no idea
he was drinking again.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.433
Well, you should have.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.227
Give me five minutes,
I'll go to
the business center

01:04.314 --> 01:05.929
and print the graphs
directly from
the spreadsheets.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.640
Run. And bring me
some paper towels.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.479
(GROANS)

01:12.739 --> 01:13.899
NORRIS: What?

01:15.492 --> 01:17.028
Oh, it hurts.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.450
NORRIS: Don't tell me
you were drinking, too.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.947
No.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.453
My ears. Oh, my God.

01:23.834 --> 01:24.949
(SCREAMING)

01:57.492 --> 02:01.656
Twenty-seven-year-old female,
intense intermittent ear pain,
saw six doctors...

02:01.747 --> 02:03.612
HOUSE: Tell her to stop
lurking in the front row.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.163
If she wants to
hit on musicians,

02:05.250 --> 02:07.992
that's what tour buses
are for. Next.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.872
If I ask why we're
in Wilson's office,

02:09.963 --> 02:12.124
is there any chance
I'll get a straight answer?

02:12.215 --> 02:13.625
Try it, try it.

02:14.343 --> 02:17.426
Fourteen-year-old boy,
joint pain and
excess hair growth.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.504
Tell him to masturbate
no more than
three times daily.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.430
With meals. Next.

02:22.517 --> 02:26.556
Did I mention that
the 27-year-old female
is really hot?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.888
And her husband
is really not.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.643
Wild guess. He's rich.

02:30.734 --> 02:35.228
Not unless social workers
have begun pulling in
the big money recently.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.821
Give me.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.318
You're taking the case
because she's hot?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.741
No, that would be
an accident of genetics.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.410
It's because she's hot
and her husband is ugly.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.160
That's a fascinating window
into the mysteries
of human psychology.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.081
Also, she's "really" hot.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.706
Or she, you know,
loves her husband.

02:51.797 --> 02:52.832
She loves something
about him.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.414
Vitamin deficiency.
She changed her diet
a few months ago.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.626
To a healthier diet.
Raw foods, lots of nuts.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.879
It's not the ear,
it's the heart.

03:02.391 --> 03:05.224
Her protein was cheese,
which can raise cholesterol.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.347
Hers was already elevated,
gave her arterial blockages.

03:08.438 --> 03:12.477
Cardiac arrhythmia
presenting as ear pain.
Very rare. Cool.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.695
So Beauty and the Beast.
Who wants to go see?

03:15.779 --> 03:17.690
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

03:33.964 --> 03:39.459
Let's see.
Dr. Taub, Foreman,
Chase and Hadley.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.759
TAUB: Four for four.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.427
Wow, I can't believe
I get all these doctors.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.879
And such
good-looking ones, too.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.431
Yeah, it's almost
like we don't all
need to be here.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.851
Your case presented
a very interesting
diagnostic challenge.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.018
Oh.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.769
(SIGHS)

03:59.865 --> 04:01.856
You can't sleep
in your own office?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.065
Or bedroom,
for that matter?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.902
Got to avoid my
natural habitat.

04:05.996 --> 04:10.080
Some idiot I went
to med school with
keeps leaving messages,

04:10.167 --> 04:11.623
wants to drop by
for lunch.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.246
So tell him "no."

04:13.336 --> 04:14.416
It's complicated.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.415
It's too complicated for you
to tell someone

04:16.506 --> 04:18.713
you don't like
to screw off?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.882
That's practically
your hobby.

04:20.969 --> 04:25.759
A few months ago,
he was sort of
part of my therapy.

04:26.475 --> 04:30.889
My shrink told me
write a letter of apology
to someone I hurt.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.974
And how did you hurt him?

04:33.064 --> 04:35.316
We were in a seminar
on flatworm genetics.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.231
I switched my final paper
with his.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.184
You plagiarized?
Doesn't sound like you.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.564
I was testing a theory.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.567
I thought that our professor
was biased against me.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.444
I assumed he'd
get a high grade
with my paper,

04:45.535 --> 04:48.072
and I'd get
a low grade with his.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.781
Interestingly,
I was wrong.
I got an A.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.115
So you're in this
mental hospital,

04:53.210 --> 04:55.121
delving into
your subconscious,

04:55.212 --> 04:57.294
and this is who you choose
to apologize to?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.462
Yep. Lorenzo Wibberly.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.210
Of all the people
in the world
you've hurt...

05:01.301 --> 05:04.589
Not everyone has a name
that's so easy to find
in the White Pages.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.510
I'm in there.
And so is Cuddy.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.305
Yeah. Yet I picked him.
It's funny, isn't it?

05:09.392 --> 05:10.518
Yes, it's hilarious.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.844
Great to see
what a success
your therapy was.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.269
We said we'd never
to go to sleep angry!

05:18.568 --> 05:21.810
We did find an arrhythmia,
but it's not from your
arteries, they're clean.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.065
Will the pain
come back?

05:23.156 --> 05:25.112
We'll start her
on cardiac meds,
that should help.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.907
But we still need
to figure out what's
causing the arrhythmia.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.495
RUSS: Hey, Valerie.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.740
Russ.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.285
It's so nice of you
to stop by.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.992
I got lots of
free time now.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.952
You don't blame me,
do you?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.878
You were drunk
in front of Norris.

05:40.966 --> 05:45.050
No,no,no,no,no.
I'm drunk now.

05:46.137 --> 05:50.927
Then, it was like
someone poisoned me
or something.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.515
Maybe you should
come back later.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.346
Okay.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.317
I just wanna
say goodbye.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.108
Okay, Russ.
Thank you for coming by.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.946
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

06:12.414 --> 06:13.654
RUSS: You poor
son of a bitch.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.534
She doesn't
love you any more
than she loved me.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.365
Okay, you need
to leave right now.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.542
You're pretending
you had an affair
with my wife?

06:19.629 --> 06:22.792
Yeah, we're all pretending.
You got nothing
to worry about.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.841
Tell them where you were
six months ago, Russ.

06:26.803 --> 06:31.638
I had a breakdown.
I had some paranoid
tendencies, as they say.

06:31.725 --> 06:35.263
But it turns out,
I had a right
to be paranoid.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.889
You need help.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.184
Get him out of here.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.890
Okay. Okay.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.817
(MIMICKING GUNSHOT)

06:49.034 --> 06:50.490

06:54.664 --> 06:55.915
Are you okay?
You okay?

06:55.999 --> 06:57.239
Yeah, I'm okay.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.872
We'll keep an eye out.
He's not getting
back in the hospital.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.586
He's making all that up.
You know that, right?

07:03.673 --> 07:05.379
Yeah, of course.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.258
CHASE: (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
Where are you?

07:13.350 --> 07:14.590
Undisclosed location.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.719
TAUB: Who are you
hiding from?

07:15.810 --> 07:16.845
Wilson.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.597
HOUSE: And the lunch date
that Wilson is,

07:18.688 --> 07:20.804
no doubt, right now,
trying to sic on me.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.891
But in
the great game of chess
that is our relationship,

07:24.027 --> 07:27.861
Wilson sees only
one move ahead,
I see dozens.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.610
That is why he will
never mate me.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.153
That's a chess term.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.111
FOREMAN: That’s great.
A co-worker confronted
our patient.

07:36.206 --> 07:39.790
Altered mental status.
Basically accused her
of poisoning him.

07:39.876 --> 07:40.865
We think
he was projecting.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.451
So he’s poisoning her.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.625
CHASE: What could
he get his hands on

07:43.713 --> 07:45.669
to cause
supraventricular
tachycardia?

07:45.924 --> 07:48.631
Does he have dry skin,
thin eyebrows?

07:48.718 --> 07:50.800
(CLAN KING)

07:50.887 --> 07:53.879
If you're sharing
an amazed look,
please do it louder.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.714
He might have.
How did you know that?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.674
He has hypothyroidism,

07:57.769 --> 07:58.975
he dumped his meds
in her coffee,

07:59.062 --> 08:01.724
that would make
her heart go boom,
in a bad way.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.850
FOREMAN: We’ll treat
with beta blockers.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.727
I'm sorry,
but I totally disagree.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.524
CHASE: With what?
THIRTEEN: With everything.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.727
Why are we assuming
he's lying and
she's telling the truth?

08:08.822 --> 08:11.529
Because she's a successful,
happily married consultant,

08:11.616 --> 08:12.947
and he's a crazy,
drunk weirdo

08:13.034 --> 08:14.274
who we just tossed
out of the hospital.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.529
And she's hot.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.201
THIRTEEN:
Maybe she picked him
because he’s vulnerable.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.658
There's something off
about her, I can feel it.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.000
If you had
any evidence...

08:21.084 --> 08:23.325
Why didn't she tell
us a co-worker puked
on her shoes

08:23.420 --> 08:24.500
right before
she collapsed?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.714
Becauseits
medically irrelevant.
He was drunk, she was sick.

08:26.798 --> 08:27.878
THIRTEEN: You don’t think
it’s suspicious

08:27.966 --> 08:29.206
she didn’t mention
it to her husband?

08:29.300 --> 08:32.463
Yeah, Foreman,
why did you break up
with Thirteen?

08:32.554 --> 08:36.263
Oh, no, wait,
the non-subtextual thing
she was saying, why that?

08:36.349 --> 08:37.509
This is about the case,

08:37.600 --> 08:40.683
not some imaginary issue
that you think
Foreman and I have.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.432
Great. Start her
on beta blockers.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.602
You'll do it?

08:51.239 --> 08:52.524
I don't think
he was talking to me.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.651
Well, I am.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.574
I'm the only one who
thinks you're wrong.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.824
Maybe that's why
I'm asking you to do it.

you'd be here.
How you been?

Check and mate.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.814
Look,

09:37.035 --> 09:39.822
I'm sorry this is
awkward or whatever.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.994
I just thought
it was nice of you
to write that letter,

09:42.082 --> 09:45.666
and I wanted to tell you
that you don't
have to feel bad.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.662
Thanks.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.091
So, where you
working these days?

09:52.175 --> 09:55.793
You got your own practice
or you at a hospital?

09:55.887 --> 10:00.051
I thought you knew.
Dani's, the organic
supermarket chain.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.052
As an in-house doctor?

10:03.686 --> 10:06.302
I actually never
gotHcensed.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.058
I didn't graduate
med school.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.481
I planned on going back,
and then my father got sick

10:10.568 --> 10:14.026
and I had to
take care of him,
and I had some bad luck.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.525
Why didn't you graduate?

10:16.616 --> 10:17.651
I was one credit short.

10:17.742 --> 10:21.200
And I was sort of already
on academic probation, so...

10:22.497 --> 10:24.362
Which credit?

10:24.457 --> 10:25.697
Igota...

10:28.545 --> 10:32.458
He failed me on that
paper you switched.
I thought you knew.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.376
So I'm guessing
you're the CEO of
this supermarket chain.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.711
I bag groceries.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.049
Life works out
weird sometimes.

We were going to do it
in Santa Barbara
because of his parents,

That's what I told her.
You can chastise me

10:59.325 --> 11:00.735
aﬁeryoulook
at the monitor.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.987
Look what's lighting up.

Lateral frontal cortex,
Broca's area. So what?

11:04.497 --> 11:05.703
I told her
it was customary

11:05.790 --> 11:07.997
to talk during MRls,
to relax.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.952
I spent the last 30 minutes
asking her about everything
in life that she loves,

11:12.046 --> 11:15.334
then hates, then feels
any emotion about at all.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.211
There's nothing in
the paralimbic system,
amygdala.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.213
Because she's
using the language
part of her brain

11:19.304 --> 11:20.760
and bypassing
the emotional.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.463
She can understand
love and pain and empathy,

11:23.558 --> 11:25.423
but she can't
feel them at all.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.139
She's a psychopath.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.940
Why do you want to
meet her so badly?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.022
Psychopaths always
fascinate me.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.947
I think it's their
cultural literacy

11:42.035 --> 11:45.243
and strong family values.
Or is that Jews?

11:45.330 --> 11:47.286
We're not gonna
be able to get
an honest read on her

11:47.373 --> 11:49.329
unless we figure out
a way to get the husband
out of there.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.624
Hmm. I got an idea.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.203
Can you get out of here?

11:54.839 --> 11:56.249
Thanks.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.470
It was the "thanks"
that did it.

12:04.849 --> 12:08.467
Hi, I'm Dr. House.
How long have you
been a psychopath?

12:11.606 --> 12:13.096
Are you kidding?
He's not.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.773
Are you saying
I'm like Ted Bundy
or something?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.816
HOUSE: Psychopathy can
get a bad rap.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.769
Doesn't necessarily
mean you're violent.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.570
Just that
you're completely
without conscience,

12:21.658 --> 12:22.989
youlack
any normal emotion,

12:23.076 --> 12:24.566
you manipulate
everyone around you,

12:24.661 --> 12:27.403
you're promiscuous,
you lie pathologically.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.613
Any of this
ringing bells?

12:29.707 --> 12:31.447
Is that why you
were asking me
all those weird questions?

12:31.542 --> 12:33.954
HOUSE: Yeah. Well,
you have Darwin
to thank for that.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.956
She got the creeps
around you.

12:36.047 --> 12:39.164
Which, oddly, is an actual
medical phenomenon
around psychopaths,

12:39.259 --> 12:41.170
probably an evolved
response to predators.

12:41.261 --> 12:45.425
I'm sorry. You're
really freaking me out.
I have no idea what...

12:45.515 --> 12:48.177
Relax. We have a duty
of confidentiality.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.259
And you have
an undiagnosed
heart problem

12:50.353 --> 12:51.934
that could kill you
at any moment.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.433
We believe that
your mental abnormality

12:54.524 --> 12:55.980
is related to
your physical one.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.774
So if you want to
keep on "predating"...

13:06.911 --> 13:09.027
What do you want
to know?

13:17.130 --> 13:19.712
Your co-worker's
story was true.
You poisoned him.

13:19.799 --> 13:24.338
No. I gave him
a little Valium
and an emetic.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.636
You sure you understand
what the word "no" means?

13:26.723 --> 13:28.179
I've had them both before,
why can't he?

13:28.266 --> 13:29.597
So you were just
helping him out?

13:29.684 --> 13:33.427
I assume he was cool
with the whole seducing
and firing part, too.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.307
Russ knew what
he was getting into.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.480
He got sex every
Thursday night,

13:37.567 --> 13:39.558
and I got to take credit
for his best ideas.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.563
And what are you getting
out of your marriage?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.440
Same thing you get
out of your job.

13:43.531 --> 13:47.945
Bill has a trust fund,
and I have a prenup
his parents made me sign.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.573
Told you he was rich.
She's not that weird.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.620
I'm not so different
than anybody else.

13:53.708 --> 13:58.168
Everyone I've ever known,
my family, my classmates,
the people I work with,

13:58.254 --> 13:59.755
they're all out
for themselves.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.875
Difference is,
I can admit it to myself.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.502
She kind of reminds me
of someone I know.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.003
Tell me about it.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.336
Some of my co-workers
will insult people
right to their faces.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.763
How long have
you been this way?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.346
Just how I am.

14:15.229 --> 14:18.096
Are you gonna cure
my heart problems now?

14:19.275 --> 14:23.359
So, psychopathy plus
cardiac arrhythmia. Go.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.027
I thought you were bluffing
to get information.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.775
You really think
they're connected?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.527
Two rare conditions
in one patient,

14:28.618 --> 14:30.108
it's a fair
assumption they are.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.034
Psychopathy is
generally just genetic,

14:32.121 --> 14:33.281
nothing you can
do about it.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.955
Something that hits
30 years after birth isn't
going to be connected.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.203
There are diseases
that could lie dormant
that long,

14:38.294 --> 14:39.830
hit her heart,
warp her brain.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.536
Maybe a handful
of diseases.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.622
It'll be super awesome
when we find it.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.504
Tertiary syphilis can cause
pseudopsychopathic syndrome
and cardiomyopathy.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.460
Fits best.
Start her on penicillin,

14:49.555 --> 14:50.544
rule out Wilson's
and Hashimoto's.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.675
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

14:51.766 --> 14:54.849
There's your handful.
Wasn't so hard, was it?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.934
You gotta do something
about Thirteen.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.736
She flouted both
my authority and yours.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.190
Yes. And she got it right
and you got it wrong.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.945
Which just aggravates
the problem.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.199
She'll do it again.
Next time, it won't
work out so well.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.580
You got to punish her.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.283
You're her boss,

15:20.378 --> 15:22.960
in some vague,
never to be
usefully defined way.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.253
You punish her.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.331
I'm also her ex,
which, as you know,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.087
makes it
a little complicated.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.883
The fact that
you also fired her

15:29.971 --> 15:32.178
takes it from
a little complicated
to a little moronic.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.254
It was the only way I...

15:33.349 --> 15:35.010
It wasn't because
you were too in love
with her,

15:35.101 --> 15:37.262
it was because
you were too in love
with your career.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.345
We're almost at my floor,
so I'll summarize.
Your problem, not mine.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.697
You cut up my only
copy of that photo.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.158
That rare daguerreotype?

15:51.242 --> 15:52.823
You can charge me
for the effort it takes

15:52.910 --> 15:54.446
to search your hard drive
for a new copy.

15:54.537 --> 15:58.371
Not the one
of me and Lucas,
the one from Ecuador.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.950
Right, I'd forgotten
about your deep emotional
attachment to lemurs.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.420
To my dad.

16:04.422 --> 16:05.628
You got his tail.

16:05.715 --> 16:10.084
He was holding the camera.
That was the last trip
we ever took together.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.590
And I don't have
a digital copy.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.758
Well, I could stand here
all day apologizing,

16:18.853 --> 16:22.220

expiate my sins
with good, clean work.

make you feel better

16:29.572 --> 16:33.315

No, I never got those.

into getting him a betterjob.

that one seminar paper

If there's any karma
in all this,

17:36.681 --> 17:39.013
he's probably happier
than you are.

Good point.
If he is happier,
there's no harm done.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.657
Would it help
if I slept with her?

22:09.745 --> 22:10.951
We were getting
to a diagnosis.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.994
No, we were already
at the diagnosis.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.447
You were creating
a fake argument

22:14.542 --> 22:15.827
about an irrelevant
treatment issue

22:15.918 --> 22:17.579
'cause you can't stand
to be around each other.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.412
So have sex, fight,
or quit, I don't care.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.918
Whatever you're
doing now isn't working.

22:32.601 --> 22:33.716
THIRTEEN: You okay?

22:33.811 --> 22:34.926
Yeah.

22:37.314 --> 22:41.227
Look, I get that
you gotta act fast,
but radiation?

22:41.318 --> 22:42.933
You definitely ruled out
everything else?

22:43.028 --> 22:45.110
I'm sorry, but...

22:47.283 --> 22:49.399
We could still check
for environmental toxins.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.779
Where does she spend
most of her time?

22:51.871 --> 22:53.862
Mostly at work, at home.

22:53.956 --> 22:56.242
Hobbies?
Recurring activities
outside the home?

22:56.333 --> 22:58.039
No. Not really.

22:58.127 --> 23:01.244
She took a landscaping
class at the Y.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.589
When did it meet?

23:02.673 --> 23:05.039
Every Thursday night
this summer.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.756
You dig in soil,
you can be exposed
to pesticides,

23:09.847 --> 23:11.553
heavy metals,
lots of bad things.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.722
Can you find out
all about her
landscaping class,

23:13.809 --> 23:15.640
where it was,
details like that?

23:15.728 --> 23:17.514
Yeah. I'll do it now.

23:25.404 --> 23:29.773
So when you watch Star Wars,
which side do you root for?

23:31.493 --> 23:35.406
(ON INTERCOM)
Dr. House,
what are you doing?

23:35.998 --> 23:38.740
Just checking in
on your radiotherapy.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.327
From what I hear,
you never visit patients.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.705
And now you've come
to chat with me twice.

23:45.799 --> 23:48.836
/ wanna know
how you like being
a management consultant.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.714
I’m thinking of
getting into it.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.886
That or psychopathy, maybe.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.676
Which pays better?

23:55.184 --> 23:57.926
/ think you’re already
into one of them.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.760
Dr. Hadley made
a joke yesterday.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.766
She said
I sound like you.

24:03.484 --> 24:06.066
You sure you understand
what "joke" means?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.360
So you're not just
out for yourself?

24:08.447 --> 24:11.735
For example,
you would never interrupt
a sick woman's treatment

24:11.825 --> 24:14.692
just because of some
personal obsession?

24:15.663 --> 24:17.449
Of course
I'm self-interested.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.700
We all are,
we're born that way.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.201
The rest of us are
born with consciences.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.628
Which is something
youjustsound
ecstatic about.

24:28.175 --> 24:31.292
I'm not saying it's logical,
I'm just saying it's human.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.845
So if you know
your conscience is just
an animal instinct,

24:34.932 --> 24:37.093
you don't need
to follow it.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.930
I think you realize that.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.602
That's why
you're talking to me.

25:01.750 --> 25:05.083
(STAMMERING) You lied about
your landscaping class.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.333
Dr. Hadley thought the soils
might be poisoned.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.504
You told him that?

25:09.591 --> 25:10.580
I just thought...

25:10.676 --> 25:13.088
Russ said you were
having an affair.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.591
Was that your cover?
Every Thursday night,
you'd...

25:18.934 --> 25:20.435
I'm so sorry.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.021
Oh, God.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.561
VALERIE: It's not
what you think.

25:25.107 --> 25:26.392
Do you remember
that telecom case

25:28.277 --> 25:30.609
In fact, we did.
And I was swamped.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.903
Every Friday morning,
we had a conference call
with London,

25:32.990 --> 25:34.355
so the night before
I would...

25:34.450 --> 25:38.068
That's your excuse?
You expect me to believe
that you were at the office?

25:38.162 --> 25:40.244
What's the biggest argument
we've ever had?

25:42.958 --> 25:45.665
that I don't need a job,
that you would
take care of me.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.618
Yeah. That's all true.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.499
You yelled at me.

25:49.590 --> 25:53.208
You made me feel
like you didn't value
anything that I did.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.508
I need this job

25:54.595 --> 25:57.428
to feel like
I'm accomplishing
something on my own.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.766
That's why I lied to you.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.715
If I call your office
tomorrow and I check...

26:01.810 --> 26:03.892
Call my office,
call my secretary,

26:03.979 --> 26:06.095
call my clients,
interrupt their dinner,

26:06.190 --> 26:07.350
wake them up,
I don't care.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.477
I just want you
to know the truth.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.484
You know I love you.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.273
Come here.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.619
Please.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.920
It's okay.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.715
Fire her.

26:39.807 --> 26:42.423
What for? You seem
to have lied your way
out of any trouble.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.349
Until Bill checks up
on my cover,

26:44.436 --> 26:46.427
and I have to
create a whole new one
to cover that one up.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.228
I've done it before,
but it's a pain,

26:48.315 --> 26:50.476
and lwould like
Dr. Hadley to
share that pain.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.943
She didn't reveal
any confidences,

26:52.027 --> 26:53.483
and she had
a valid medical reason

26:53.570 --> 26:54.980
to ask about your
landscaping class.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.937
We can see what
a jury says about that.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.818
And admit to your
husband the truth?

26:58.909 --> 27:00.695
You're not going
to sue us.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.323
We will remove Dr. Hadley
from all patient contact.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.402
What?

27:04.498 --> 27:07.786
But it's for
Dr. Hadley's benefit,
not yours.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.868
We have no obligation
to inflict you on her.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.203
Fine.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.831
But just so you know,
this is not
for your benefit.

27:15.926 --> 27:19.168
Dr. Cuddy is furious
that you put her hospital
at risk.

27:19.263 --> 27:20.423
She just knows
it's a bad idea

27:20.514 --> 27:22.880
to admit it
in front of me.

27:23.517 --> 27:24.973
CUDDY: Think what you want.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.800
By the way,
your orderly's outside.

27:26.895 --> 27:29.557
But I'd wait about
another 10 minutes

27:29.648 --> 27:30.854
if you really want
your husband to think

27:30.941 --> 27:33.557
you're having
radiation treatments.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.436
VALERIE: Dr. Hadley?

27:38.407 --> 27:40.523
Are you, by chance,
gonna cry?

27:41.410 --> 27:44.117
'Cause that's the one
I just can't do.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.923
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

28:02.389 --> 28:05.096
Hello?
This is Dr. Hadley.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.553
What?

28:14.568 --> 28:16.354
You called
the medical board?

28:16.445 --> 28:17.480
What is she talking about?

28:17.571 --> 28:19.186
THIRTEEN: "Accusations
of sexual harassment."

28:20.532 --> 28:21.567
CHASE: Thirteen, come on.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.365
You already got me
fired from the case,
what else do you want?

28:24.453 --> 28:27.490
Dr. Hadley,
get out here now.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.379
You're acting
like an idiot.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.332
She's trying to make me
lose my license!

28:40.427 --> 28:42.042
She'll fail,
unless you're
stupid enough

28:42.137 --> 28:43.252
to go in there
and scream at her.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.463
Sexual harassment accusations
are incredibly serious.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.798
If she made them anonymously,
the case goes away.

28:47.893 --> 28:51.226
If she used her name,
we all back you up,
it goes away.

28:51.313 --> 28:52.803
You're completely
overreacting.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.014
You'd be pissed off, too,
if you were me.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.097
Or maybe not,
I don't know.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.729
You're just about as
emotional as she is.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.229
I'm doing you a favor.
I know.

28:59.321 --> 29:03.405
And even when you try
to do something nice,
you sound like a jerk.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.025
I'm sorry.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.119
For what?

29:10.582 --> 29:12.288
For firing you.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.162
Don't do that.
That's not what
this is about.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.494
Then I'll apologize anyway.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.874
I did it for me,
not for you.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.209
I realized that
right after I fired you,

29:24.054 --> 29:26.010
but I couldn't admit it.

29:27.683 --> 29:31.676
I screwed everything up.
I hope that we can
still work together.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.186
(PAGER BEEPING)

29:38.610 --> 29:39.941
Something's wrong
with her liver.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.144
Blood flow's backing up,
spilling into her esophagus.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.025
BILL: From the cancer?
This isn't lymphoma.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.105
We don't know
what it is.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.280
We can wrap bands
around the veins,

29:46.368 --> 29:47.949
but the bleed is so bad,
that might not work.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.651
We want to try something
called the TIPS,

29:49.746 --> 29:52.123
a shunt that
makes the blood
bypass the liver.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.287
That'll save her?

29:53.375 --> 29:54.956
It should help preserve
her liver and heart.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.705
But the liver
cleans out toxins,
so bypass it too long,

29:57.796 --> 29:59.297
she'll get brain damage,
eventually die.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.588
But that's still
probably less dangerous
than bleeding out now.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.006
Probably?

30:04.553 --> 30:06.794
Valerie usually
makes the decisions...

30:06.888 --> 30:08.219
You gotta step up now.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.845
Was she cheating on me?
I can't discuss...

30:12.936 --> 30:16.224
Just tell me
she wasn't lying.
Just tell me that.

30:21.903 --> 30:24.610
I'm supposed to
make this decision?

30:24.698 --> 30:26.814
I don't even know
who she is any more.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.524
Either way,
you gotta do it
right now.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.579
Do whatever
you think is right.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.843
I'd give her a day,
two days at the most.

30:48.930 --> 30:52.514
Great. You be the clock,
everyone else
will be the doctors.

30:52.601 --> 30:53.841
Heart, kidneys,
now liver.

30:53.935 --> 30:54.970
Amyloidosis.

30:55.062 --> 30:58.179
No speckles on the MRI.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin
deficiency?

30:58.273 --> 30:59.388
Too much kidney failure.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.769
Primary hepatic fibrosis.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.440
It's our best guess.
Start her on steroids.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.613
CHASE: Even if we're right,
the Iiver's probably
too scarred.

31:08.700 --> 31:09.689
We got to list her
for a new one.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.116
With an unconfirmed
diagnosis?

31:11.244 --> 31:12.700
Not gonna happen.
FOREMAN: How about
a family member?

31:12.788 --> 31:14.198
CHASE: I don't think
the husband's
the right blood type.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.575
Even if he was,
he's not going to
give his liver now.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.872
He left her, I assume?

31:17.959 --> 31:19.119
TAUB: Not yet.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.373
He says
he won't abandon her
while she's sick.

31:22.464 --> 31:24.204
She have any other
family members?

31:24.299 --> 31:26.130
No one's going to risk
their life to save hers.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.834
Man, one false accusation
from a psychopath,

31:28.929 --> 31:30.885
and you turn out
to be a real bummer.

31:30.972 --> 31:34.135
I'm gonna go see if
Wilson has any liver left.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.065
What are you doing?

31:48.156 --> 31:51.694
Paying Wibberly's mortgage
for a few months.

31:51.785 --> 31:54.572
Congratulations
on another successful
round of hectoring.

31:54.663 --> 31:57.621
Wait a minute.
Is that actually
a check for him?

31:57.707 --> 32:01.074
No, it's a giant
novelty item for
winning the lottery,

32:01.169 --> 32:03.285
you're just standing
really far away.

32:03.380 --> 32:07.123
Of all the people to
go the extra mile for,
why this guy?

32:07.217 --> 32:10.880
I don't know,
he just kind of smells good
and makes me laugh.

32:10.971 --> 32:14.134
Why not Cuddy?
You never apologized after
you defaced her photo.

32:14.224 --> 32:16.931
Maybe because I recognize
that sending someone
to the poorhouse

32:17.018 --> 32:19.509
is a little more serious
than editing a snapshot.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.266
No, it's because Cuddy
actually means something
to you,

32:24.526 --> 32:25.891
(GROANS)

32:26.403 --> 32:29.566
If it'll make you shut up,
I will tell her I'm sorry
about the photo.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.988
Forget the photo.
House, she was
in love with you.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.157
And all she got
in return was abuse.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.701
For years, you toyed
with her emotions.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.948
She wasn't
in love with me.

32:38.039 --> 32:41.202
The fact that you
still can't admit it
just proves my point.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.080
What do you want?
Helping the guy
was your idea.

32:44.171 --> 32:46.207
No, help the guy,
whatever.

32:46.298 --> 32:50.041
I'm just pointing out
that it's much easier
to soothe your guilt

32:50.135 --> 32:51.841
by throwing money
at a stranger

32:51.928 --> 32:55.591
than by making amends
to a person you actually
care about.

32:55.682 --> 32:58.014
You had me
at "much easier."

32:58.101 --> 33:00.763
I'm going to pretend
to go to work now.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.018
Ping.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.082
Sarah?

33:30.342 --> 33:32.333
I'm Dr. Hadley.
I'm sorry to bother you,

33:32.427 --> 33:34.133
but I was told that
you're Valerie's sister.

33:34.221 --> 33:35.210
Mmm.

33:35.305 --> 33:38.138
I was just surprised
you came to visit.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.767
(LAUGHS)

33:39.935 --> 33:42.176
So is the rest
of my family.

33:42.270 --> 33:45.012
I was even more surprised
you got tested as a donor.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.186
Wrong blood type.

33:46.274 --> 33:50.142
But why? I mean,
you know what she's like.

33:50.237 --> 33:52.102
She's not that bad.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.733
Yes. She is.

33:57.661 --> 34:00.152
Our dad was a mean drunk.

34:01.248 --> 34:02.704
I was the older sister.

34:02.791 --> 34:06.750
I was supposed to
stand up for her,
not the other way around.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.919
She protected you
when you were kids?

34:10.006 --> 34:13.498
Yeah. And then
all of a sudden,
all of his crap

34:14.427 --> 34:18.796
and all his abuse,
itjust changed her.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.972
It made her cold.

34:22.644 --> 34:23.724
VVhen?

34:28.275 --> 34:30.812
We were wrong.
Psychopathy is
a symptom.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.109
I spoke to her sister.
She wasn't
always like this.

34:33.196 --> 34:36.154
She changed,
and right around
adolescence.

34:38.201 --> 34:44.538
So, liver,
heart, brain lie dormant,
and it starts at puberty.

34:51.256 --> 34:56.216
The raw food diet
made it go fulminant.
Nuts are high in copper.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.752
It's Wilson's disease.

34:58.847 --> 35:01.759
We ruled that out.
No Keyser-Fleischer rings.

35:03.393 --> 35:07.352
There is one other sign.
I know there are
lipstick lesbians.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.897
Are there
nail-polish-remover bisexuals?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.936
BILL: She's not
supposed to be here.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.237
As a doctor.

35:17.324 --> 35:20.816
You didn't say
anything about her capacity
as a beautician's assistant.

35:36.176 --> 35:37.586
Her fingernail's blue?

35:37.677 --> 35:38.792
Yep.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.878
Start her on chelation.

35:41.765 --> 35:43.050
What just happened?

35:43.141 --> 35:44.347
You're gonna get better.

35:44.434 --> 35:47.301
Your body has an inability
to process copper.

35:47.395 --> 35:49.977
It caused all
of your problems.

35:50.065 --> 35:51.680
Even what's wrong
with your brain.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.141
That's going
to change, too?

35:54.235 --> 35:57.398
It's probably rewired
her neurons permanently
by now.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.229
But it's possible?

36:00.408 --> 36:02.069
Maybe.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.900
I have to go get
the chelation equipment.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.907
Bill, I need you
to sign some forms.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.507
You don't see
what she's doing?

36:16.591 --> 36:19.173
She's laying the groundwork
to get her treatment,

36:19.260 --> 36:22.002
wake up a completely
different person

36:22.097 --> 36:26.010
so that you and
all of your money
stay with her.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.966
It's a lie.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.267
You said
there was a chance.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.141
Okay, there's
a teeny chance.

36:32.232 --> 36:36.225
But even if it cures her,
it's not going to
make her love you.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.521
I was happy before.

36:42.450 --> 36:47.615
I know, and I'm sorry,
but it wasn't real.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.329
It felt real.

36:54.796 --> 36:56.332
I don't know...

36:58.967 --> 37:01.083
Maybe that can be enough.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.763
WIBBERLY: You're really
doing this for me?

37:16.901 --> 37:18.311
Tax shelter.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.111
I'll take some
of that chili now.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.823
I can't accept this.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.700
Fine, forget the chili.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.165
Bye, Wibberly.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.998
I got an A plus
with your paper.

37:40.425 --> 37:44.259
I was an orthopedic
surgeon for 10 years
at New York Mercy.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.085
I had a gambling problem.

37:46.181 --> 37:49.093
I tried to cover it
by overbilling some
Medicare patients.

37:49.184 --> 37:52.267
Lost my license.
That's why I'm here.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.093
Not because of you.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.271
Why are you
telling me this now?

37:58.860 --> 38:00.521
Because I thought
you'd be the same bastard

38:00.612 --> 38:03.319
you were
in med school, but...

38:15.460 --> 38:16.449
Keepit

38:16.544 --> 38:18.626
No. I can get
another place.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.295
Just take it.
I screwed you over.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.792
You got me an A plus.

38:22.884 --> 38:24.294
Takeit
No.

38:24.385 --> 38:28.094
Do I have to shove
it down your throat?
Take the damn check!

38:54.082 --> 38:55.868
Your vitals are up.

38:58.920 --> 38:59.955
Treatment's working.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.547
I'm not sure we can
fix your liver,

39:01.631 --> 39:04.919
but we can definitely
list you for a new one.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.752
When you're better,
we're gonna take
a long vacation.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.678
You want to go to Vietnam,
one of the beaches?

39:10.765 --> 39:14.678
We're gonna get a hut,
just you and me,
nothing to worry about.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.434
You're pathetic.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.067
What?

39:25.154 --> 39:29.739
I mean, when you
had a suspicion, fine,
but you know now.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.782
How can you
be this pitiful?

39:33.162 --> 39:35.574
You don't mean this.
You're sick.

39:35.665 --> 39:36.905
I'm not sick.

39:38.126 --> 39:40.208
I almost died,
and I still might.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.377
And who knows,
maybe it's focusing
my mind

39:42.463 --> 39:44.875
because the idea
of spending the rest
of my life with you...

39:44.966 --> 39:46.297
Valerie...

40:04.110 --> 40:05.566
Why'd you do that?

40:05.653 --> 40:06.938
Because he's pathetic.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.270
He hasn't changed.

40:14.495 --> 40:19.114
But you have.
The treatment actually
worked on your brain.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.368
If you were still
a psychopath,

40:20.460 --> 40:22.200
you would have just
kept draining him dry.

40:22.295 --> 40:23.284
What do you want?

40:23.379 --> 40:25.370
You're feeling something.

40:25.465 --> 40:28.582
What is it?
What do you feel?

40:33.556 --> 40:35.057
I don't know.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.267
It hurts.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.526
It Will.

41:05.588 --> 41:08.751
Heard about the diagnosis.
Nice job.

41:08.841 --> 41:12.004
Thanks. Why are you
here so late?

41:12.095 --> 41:16.589
Discharge summary.
Taub's handwriting
isn't helping much.

41:16.683 --> 41:18.173
Apparently on
the third day
of admission,

41:18.267 --> 41:21.100
the patient undenNent
"rabbit thumping."

41:21.187 --> 41:22.552
(LAUGHING)

41:26.859 --> 41:28.395
"Radiotherapy."

41:28.820 --> 41:29.900
Ah.

41:32.198 --> 41:33.654
"Third day after admission,

41:33.741 --> 41:35.402
"patient undenNent
radiotherapy

41:35.493 --> 41:39.156
"including external
beam radiation

41:44.711 --> 41:46.872
"to treat
B-cell lymphomas.

41:47.422 --> 41:49.413
"First treatment was

41:52.301 --> 41:54.292
"full-mantle therapy..."
