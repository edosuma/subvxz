00:02.168 --> 00:03.692
<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:03.737 --> 00:06.672
Hilda Suarez, I love you.
Will you marry me?

00:07.307 --> 00:10.037
- So, you like someone.
- Yeah.

00:12.045 --> 00:13.307
Are you my mother?

00:13.747 --> 00:14.907
Yeah.

00:14.948 --> 00:17.508
- Tyler is not who you think he is.
- Who is he, then?

00:17.550 --> 00:19.040
He's your brother.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.481
I really need to see you tonight.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.250
I'm kind of busy right now.

00:23.289 --> 00:25.086
Thanks for not ditching me tonight.

00:25.125 --> 00:28.356
My name is Betty Suarez,
and I'm looking for a new orthodontist.

00:28.395 --> 00:31.592
I've been wearing braces
for over four years now.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.483 --> 00:52.075
Goodbye, braces.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.749
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:01.127 --> 01:02.253
- Okay.
- Hey!

01:02.295 --> 01:06.231
<i>Papi, Betty and I were up all night
talking about my wedding,</i>

01:06.266 --> 01:08.757
and there is really no way
that we can do it

01:08.802 --> 01:11.032
without 100 snow-white doves.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.437
What do you need doves for?
City's full of pigeons.

01:13.473 --> 01:17.603
- And they're free.
- Pigeons? Why do you hate me?

01:17.644 --> 01:20.670
Betty, back me up.

01:20.713 --> 01:23.682
I don't know if I said 100 white doves.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.752
Where is Justin when you need him?

01:27.720 --> 01:29.449
Hey, Austin.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.180
Just leaving another message.

01:32.225 --> 01:35.194
Don't really know how you're feeling
about what happened.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.025
You know, the kiss.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.955
Maybe you lost your phone
or something.

01:39.999 --> 01:42.490
I don't really know, probably not.

01:43.303 --> 01:46.136
Anyway, you can call me back.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.665
This is Justin.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.808
<i>Justin, Papi doesn't understand
the doves.</i>

01:52.412 --> 01:54.607
There have to be 100
and if they're not snow-white

01:54.647 --> 01:56.239
then they might as well
just be pigeons.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.773
That's what I said. Betty, before I forget,

01:58.818 --> 02:00.911
this is your last check
for the orthodontist.

02:00.954 --> 02:04.151
<i>Papi, I'm an adult, I can cover it myself.</i>

02:04.190 --> 02:05.953
Then I will take it.

02:05.992 --> 02:08.425
What? Champagne waterfalls
are very expensive.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.453
Please, I'm your father. Let me do this.
And besides, it's my fault.

02:11.498 --> 02:14.763
Everyone on my side of the family
has the big crazy chompers.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.632
AB, look this way.

02:17.070 --> 02:21.029
I got you just a little small something
to celebrate your braces coming off.

02:21.574 --> 02:23.439
How sweet.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.773
Not so fast.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.904
You can't have it
until those things are gone.

02:26.946 --> 02:29.972
Okay, well,
one more thing to look forward to.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.979
All right, family,
say goodbye to the braces,

02:34.020 --> 02:36.818
'cause you're never
gonna see them again.

02:36.856 --> 02:38.881
Bye, braces.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.200
Tyler? Interesting. I'm totally on board.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.004
Oh? Um...

02:52.972 --> 02:56.032
Amanda spilled a wine cooler
on my shirt last night, so...

02:56.075 --> 02:58.339
Last night. So you slept over.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.310
Booyah! I totally got the stain out.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.815
Thanks. So, listen,
I should probably go.

03:11.858 --> 03:12.984
Okay.

03:13.760 --> 03:19.062
- So, will I see you later?
- Yeah, if you want to.

03:36.649 --> 03:39.880
Marc, nothing happened.
Honest to Prada.

03:39.919 --> 03:42.979
He was just jetlagged from
his trip with Claire so he stayed over.

03:43.022 --> 03:46.150
That right there was
the first time we've even kissed.

03:46.192 --> 03:47.819
It's actually kind of nice.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.351
Getting to know a guy
before I tickle his ginger.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.421
- Sweet.
- It really is.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.130
Marc, I think this might be
the start of something real.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.730
So, does Daniel know about you
and his half brother?

03:59.772 --> 04:02.297
No, Daniel doesn't know
and he's never going to.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.004
Really? Never?
Secrets come out, Mandy.

04:05.979 --> 04:09.107
If you think this is real,
you should probably tell Daniel

04:09.148 --> 04:11.912
before he hears about it
someplace else.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.117
So, the whole time
I'm on this date, right,

04:20.159 --> 04:23.560
I keep staring at
this guy's funky lateral incisor.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.791
But I mean, I can't say anything,
'cause you know how men are.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.629
They're so sensitive.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.892
What was that?

04:30.670 --> 04:31.932
- Dr. Frankel?
- Yeah?

04:31.971 --> 04:33.268
I'm really enjoying this story,

04:33.306 --> 04:35.672
but we're gonna take my braces off
today, right?

04:35.708 --> 04:38.541
- Of course. Absolutely, of course.
- Great.

04:38.578 --> 04:41.979
So, anyway, I'm sitting at the table
and Mr. Funkity Tooth

04:42.015 --> 04:44.984
is taking forever with his menu, right?

04:45.018 --> 04:48.215
Look, I have to be at work soon
because it's picture day

04:48.254 --> 04:51.951
and I'm really looking forward
to getting a new ID with my new smile.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.425
And I don't want to rush you
or anything...

04:54.460 --> 04:57.156
Enough said. Absolutely.
You have had these on forever

04:57.196 --> 05:00.563
and you are dying to get them off.
We're not gonna waste another minute.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.727
- You ready?
- I'm so ready.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.605
And...

05:08.207 --> 05:10.869
- There's the fire alarm.
- Are you fricking kidding me?

05:10.910 --> 05:13.310
I'm so sorry,
it's been on the fritz all week.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.871
Well, at least the sprinklers
didn't go off this time.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.075
What?

05:23.990 --> 05:27.824
I just got back.
I brought you some Parisian chocolate.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.954
Great, but I'm kind of busy right now
getting ready for this shoot.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.728
Yes, the Million Dollar Bra.
Everybody's talking about it.

05:34.767 --> 05:39.204
You really pulled off quite a coup there.
Ad sales are through the roof.

05:41.774 --> 05:44.299
Aren't you going to ask me
about my trip?

05:44.344 --> 05:47.677
- How was your trip?
- Alexis and Tyler really hit it off.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.113
You know, she was skeptical at first,

05:49.148 --> 05:52.914
but then when she really let herself
get to know him... I just...

05:53.519 --> 05:55.544
I wish you had been there.

05:55.588 --> 05:58.751
Yeah. A fun vacation
with my half brother, who I don't like,

05:58.791 --> 06:02.022
and my mother who lied to me
about his very existence.

06:02.061 --> 06:04.154
Daniel, can we please
just talk about this?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.792
Why start now?
I'm late for my meeting. Excuse me.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.565
I have three words for you,
Million Dollar Bra.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.599
It's never been featured
on a cover before,

06:17.643 --> 06:21.340
<i>but the good people at Eve's Seduction
are allowing Mode to be the very first.</i>

06:21.381 --> 06:22.871
Thanks to me.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.710
Thank you, thank you.

06:27.153 --> 06:31.453
Yes, yes, Daniel did something right.
Hallelujah, it's a miracle.

06:31.824 --> 06:34.258
So, the bra launches its world tour

06:34.293 --> 06:36.853
with a gala send-off this afternoon
at the Guggenheim.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.524
We'll be shooting the bra
immediately after

06:39.565 --> 06:42.125
at the Guggenheim. Also thanks to me.

06:43.002 --> 06:47.029
If you turn to page 7 of your packets,
you'll see the bra's itinerary for the day.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.041
Or bra-tinerary.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.870
We are working under
a very tight timeline.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.346
So you will have four hours
to shoot the bra.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.506
Daniel,

06:57.550 --> 07:00.348
I'm sure you have
this all thought through, and...

07:00.386 --> 07:04.117
I might be a little slow,
but can you explain to me

07:04.157 --> 07:07.490
how we're gonna shoot the bra
while it's on a plane?

07:07.627 --> 07:09.094
What are you talking about?

07:09.128 --> 07:12.063
Well, according to your bra-tinerary,

07:12.098 --> 07:13.861
you have us shooting
the bra in the afternoon,

07:13.900 --> 07:16.027
but the new press release
from Eve's Seduction

07:16.068 --> 07:19.868
has the bra on its way to Cairo
at the same time.

07:20.239 --> 07:24.175
I'm sure it's just been a little mix-up
and it won't be a problem.

07:24.343 --> 07:26.243
No, this is a huge problem.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.179
I know the bra has a busy schedule,

07:28.214 --> 07:31.183
but you promised me
four hours to do the shoot.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.275
We...

07:32.318 --> 07:35.116
No, we didn't have a written agreement,
we had a verbal one.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.349
Look, just put someone else
on the phone.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.484
- Hello? Hello?
- Daniel,

07:41.260 --> 07:42.989
can I talk to you for a minute?

07:44.697 --> 07:46.528
I sort of met someone.

07:46.566 --> 07:47.794
Really?

07:49.569 --> 07:52.732
Well, good for you, I guess.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.063
There's more.

07:55.675 --> 07:56.869
It's Tyler.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.039
Amanda,

08:00.546 --> 08:02.275
how can you do this to me?

08:02.682 --> 08:05.242
We said we were casual.
I thought that's how this worked.

08:05.284 --> 08:07.809
Yeah, but he's my half brother.
Don't you see how messed up that is?

08:07.854 --> 08:10.015
- Daniel.
- Don't say anything.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.029
Do you think maybe...

08:28.374 --> 08:29.671
Sorry, I was talking.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.745
Hey, that's not so bad.

08:34.046 --> 08:35.808
I had planned everything out.

08:35.847 --> 08:39.477
I was supposed to have my braces off.
I picked out a nice outfit.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.316
Why didn't you wear it?

08:41.888 --> 08:45.346
And then the sprinklers went off
at my orthodontist's this morning.

08:45.391 --> 08:48.383
- Ironically improving your look slightly.
- Thanks.

08:48.427 --> 08:53.228
Hey, Betty. Ask me if in four years I've
ever gotten tired of making fun of you.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.791
- Go ahead, ask me. Ask me.
- In four years, have you ever...

08:55.835 --> 08:56.961
No.

08:57.370 --> 09:01.830
Okay, Betty, wait, come back, come on.
We can fix this. Look, watch.

09:02.341 --> 09:05.037
First, we just got to
get rid of the braces.

09:05.511 --> 09:07.536
Then we'll fix that hair.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.372
- Ah! Thank you, Marc.
- We're not done yet.

09:10.416 --> 09:14.580
Now we've got to fix that face.
Let's try this, and this, and this.

09:17.823 --> 09:21.224
- Marc, this looks nothing like me.
- You're welcome.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.396
I am out of options.

09:24.430 --> 09:27.126
Their head of publicity changed
the bra's schedule last minute.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.657
- She really screwed me on this.
- So, go above her.

09:29.702 --> 09:33.103
Betty, the only person higher up
at Eve's Seduction is Eve herself.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.299
And no one's ever seen her smile.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.069
Everybody knows
she's a cast-iron bitch.

09:36.108 --> 09:38.804
I mean, look at her.
Last time she smiled was

09:38.844 --> 09:41.142
when Dick Cheney
shot that guy in the face.

09:41.847 --> 09:45.078
Mmm. All right, so don't go above her.
Go below her.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.642
Eve's assistant Alison is super nice
and we're old pals.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.746
She's probably online right now.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.051
Look, I'm sorry I'm so stressed.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.490
First, this whole thing with the bra
and then Amanda.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.084
You know she broke up with me?

09:55.127 --> 09:56.856
- She broke up with you?
- Yeah.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.591
I thought it was more casual than that.

09:58.631 --> 10:02.465
No, we were. It's just that
she wanted to start seeing Tyler.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.703
Tyler? Your brother?

10:05.738 --> 10:06.898
That's intense.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.429
Why would she do something like that?

10:08.474 --> 10:09.771
I don't know.

10:09.809 --> 10:13.245
Maybe she wanted something
more than casual.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.577
Hey, come on,
I can do something more than casual.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.948
Okay. I'm just saying,
is that really what you want?

10:19.919 --> 10:23.218
<i>- Hey, A-Bomb!
- B- Bomb!</i>

10:23.255 --> 10:26.850
<i>Got the birthday flowers.
You rock, hard.</i>

10:26.892 --> 10:29.156
<i>- You rock harder.
- You're a rock star.</i>

10:29.195 --> 10:31.629
<i>- You're a rocket ship.
- You are rock candy.</i>

10:31.664 --> 10:35.259
<i>Okay, can we just save all this
rocking for later, ladies? Thanks.</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:37.292
<i>Sorry. He's stressed.</i>

10:37.336 --> 10:40.703
<i>Look, I just found out
that the bra has to go to Egypt.</i>

10:40.740 --> 10:42.332
<i>That's really gonna
screw up our shoot.</i>

10:42.375 --> 10:43.899
<i>Is there something you can do to help?</i>

10:44.176 --> 10:47.612
<i>That might be tough.
Eve's in one of her moods today.</i>

10:47.647 --> 10:50.582
<i>She does always pad
the bra's schedule, though.</i>

10:50.616 --> 10:52.641
<i>So, tell you what.
Why don't we meet at the Guggenheim</i>

10:52.685 --> 10:54.983
<i>and see if we can try to convince her?
What do you say?</i>

10:55.021 --> 10:57.615
<i>- I'd say you rock.
- No, you rock.</i>

10:57.657 --> 10:59.887
<i>- No, you rock.
- Okay, you both rock.</i>

10:59.925 --> 11:02.155
<i>Sorry, thank you.
We'll see you later. Bye-bye.</i>

11:03.062 --> 11:05.929
Betty, one. Giving up, zero.

11:06.899 --> 11:10.801
You've got a raisin stuck
in your braces. Kind of gross.

11:11.203 --> 11:12.227
Ew!

11:24.450 --> 11:27.112
Hey, braces. The museum is closed
for a private party.

11:27.153 --> 11:28.643
Your school's group is over there.

11:29.488 --> 11:32.082
<i>No, I'm not with them.
I'm actually with Mode.</i>

11:32.124 --> 11:33.216
ID.

11:33.259 --> 11:34.749
What's with all the security?

11:34.794 --> 11:37.456
Eve's Seduction hired us
to protect the bra, miss.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.487
Can I see your press ID?

11:40.032 --> 11:41.260
Yep.

11:45.237 --> 11:46.795
This isn't you.

11:48.874 --> 11:49.898
Oh.

11:51.143 --> 11:53.941
Actually, it's a funny story.
See, it was picture day at work today

11:53.979 --> 11:57.073
and this guy I know
thought it would be funny to...

11:57.116 --> 11:59.141
Step to the side, ma'am.

12:07.093 --> 12:09.357
I'm gonna have to
ask you to open your mouth.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.795
Why? What do you think
you're gonna find?

12:11.831 --> 12:15.062
I have braces, okay?
I'm an adult woman with braces.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.159
It's a pain.

12:16.202 --> 12:19.137
Do I wish that I was born
with perfect teeth? Yes. But I wasn't.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.435
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have a job to do.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.371
- A-Bomb!
- Bomb!

12:33.986 --> 12:36.978
<i>Do I wish I was born
with perfect teeth? Yes.</i>

12:37.923 --> 12:40.050
<i>You got a raisin stuck
in your braces.</i>

13:08.854 --> 13:10.219
What happened?

13:10.256 --> 13:11.951
You got your wish.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.344
Dr. Frankel.

13:33.846 --> 13:35.211
What are you doing here?

13:35.247 --> 13:39.513
Well, you wished you were born
with perfect teeth and here you are.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.486
You have perfect teeth.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.913
You're welcome.

13:44.824 --> 13:49.261
So, what are you?
My guardian angel? A tooth fairy?

13:49.929 --> 13:51.328
I don't do labels.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.455
Wait a minute.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.605
I don't need glasses!

14:04.176 --> 14:07.111
- Wait, why don't I need glasses?
- You got Lasik.

14:07.146 --> 14:10.274
You wanted perfect eyes
to match your perfect teeth.

14:10.316 --> 14:13.843
In this world,
you're actually just a little bit vain.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.114
- Really?
- Mmm.

14:15.487 --> 14:16.784
That doesn't sound like me at all.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.018
<i>Hilda? Papi?</i>

14:21.060 --> 14:22.652
Are you guys...

14:27.032 --> 14:29.125
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

14:29.468 --> 14:32.062
- This is my house.
- Yeah, actually, it's not.

14:32.104 --> 14:33.696
- It's not?
- No.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.172
Where's my family?

14:35.207 --> 14:36.834
Baby, get the bat.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.067
Oh.

14:41.780 --> 14:46.183
My family lives here?
This is amazing.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.846
And all of this happened
because I had perfect teeth?

14:48.888 --> 14:51.186
<i>Well, since your papi
didn't have to pay for your braces,</i>

14:51.223 --> 14:53.714
all that money went
right into the tech boom.

14:53.759 --> 14:56.489
<i>Rented out your old house and voilà.</i>

14:56.528 --> 14:58.018
<i>Casa Suarez.</i>

15:03.636 --> 15:06.503
Oh, my God. Is that my family?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.971
<i>Hey!
- Mija, there you are.</i>

15:11.010 --> 15:12.875
- We've been looking for you.
- Yeah, hi.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.402
Hi, guys.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.811
Hilda, you look so...

15:18.584 --> 15:21.052
Beautiful? I know.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.816
Well, I took your advice.
I'm wearing makeup.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.051
Isn't she a knockout?

15:26.091 --> 15:28.685
Anyway, Betty, I have been looking
everywhere for a wedding dress

15:28.727 --> 15:30.957
that looks like the one
that you wore to prom.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.430
I went to prom?

15:40.306 --> 15:41.830
I was Prom Queen?

15:41.874 --> 15:44.741
Okay, ha-ha, very funny.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.543
Anyway, do you think
I can pull off a dress like that?

15:48.580 --> 15:52.710
Your opinion means so much to me.
You know, you're my fashion guru.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.224
There you are.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.751
- I'm so sorry.
- Where'd you go?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.195
I've been working double duty.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.357
I'm showing Anna Paquin
what her life would have been like

16:07.399 --> 16:09.492
if she didn't have that giant gap
in her teeth.

16:09.535 --> 16:12.504
Okay, well, everything seems great.

16:12.538 --> 16:17.737
I mean, my family is loaded and
Hilda is happier than I've ever seen her.

16:18.077 --> 16:21.945
- But why does she look so...
- Different?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.812
- Yeah.
- It's the law of the universe.

16:23.849 --> 16:26.511
That there can only be
one really pretty sister.

16:26.552 --> 16:29.715
I mean, think about it, right?
There's Paris and Nicky,

16:29.755 --> 16:32.622
Kim and Khloe, Jeff and Beau.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.819
So, I'm the pretty sister?

16:34.860 --> 16:38.023
You know you love it.
Don't pretend you don't.

16:38.297 --> 16:42.529
You'd be surprised how something as
simple as perfect teeth can change you.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.627
And the people around you.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.972
<i>Good afternoon, Mode magazine.
Please hold. Hi, Betty.</i>

16:59.284 --> 17:03.118
- Marc. You have a baby?
I'm so sorry.

17:03.155 --> 17:07.057
Didier had a big trial today
and our sitter canceled.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.821
You look beautiful, by the way.
Are those earrings new? They're great.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.298
And you're nice.
What are you doing at reception?

17:13.332 --> 17:15.459
Answering phones, alphabetizing files,

17:15.501 --> 17:17.935
but if you need me to run any errands,
I can totally do that.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.300
Rosalita will sleep through anything.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.932
She once slept through
a coup attempt in El Salvador.

17:23.608 --> 17:27.545
<i>Oopsie poopsie.
Somebody did a numero dos.</i>

17:28.012 --> 17:29.139
I've just got to changesies,

17:29.181 --> 17:31.547
but if you need anything,
seriously, just...

17:37.189 --> 17:39.123
I can't believe
he brought that little goblin.

17:39.158 --> 17:42.025
- Amanda?
- This is a place of work-ish.

17:43.629 --> 17:48.123
Okay, could Marc's desk be any gayer?
Not that I mind gay. I love gay.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.830
I just usually prefer
the loud, swishy, stereotypical kind.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.861
- You're awfully quiet today.
- Am I?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.396
Yeah. Usually you'd chime in

17:55.441 --> 17:58.774
with some funny remark about
his lesbian jeans or his Jheri curls.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.145
You mean you and I make fun of Marc?

18:02.181 --> 18:04.615
Only every
Monday through Friday, bestie.

18:04.650 --> 18:08.552
Bestie, I don't think you
should be stealing all that petty cash.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.920
It's not stealing
when you own half the company, B.

18:12.591 --> 18:13.751
Mmm-hmm.

18:14.126 --> 18:17.425
Yeppers. Married to Daniel.

18:17.796 --> 18:20.856
Can you believe it?
I mean, at first, it was just casual, right?

18:20.899 --> 18:23.424
And then he gets wind
that she's seeing other guys,

18:23.469 --> 18:25.630
and then, of course,
Daniel gets serious.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.798
Jealousy.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.401
It can make a man marry you.
Or throw acid in your face.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.611
Well, they seem happy.

18:36.548 --> 18:37.947
Dr. Frankel?

18:37.983 --> 18:42.420
- Betty, these just came for you.
- They did? From who?

18:42.454 --> 18:44.718
- Derek.
- Derek who?

18:46.291 --> 18:47.918
Derek Jeter?

18:48.961 --> 18:52.192
- I'm dating Derek Jeter?
- Well, you were.

18:52.231 --> 18:54.756
He's trying to win you back.
Why am I telling you this?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.893
He can have me back.

18:56.935 --> 18:59.460
I'll just put these in your office.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.617
I'm a managing editor?

19:14.386 --> 19:15.717
I'm rich.

19:16.688 --> 19:19.748
And I'm dating Derek Jeter.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.916
It's great to be Betty Suarez.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.762
It seems like everyone is doing great.

19:37.309 --> 19:41.143
Daniel. It's so good to see you.

19:41.713 --> 19:44.341
Why?
You got some bad news to deliver?

19:44.983 --> 19:47.144
Don't like what I'm wearing? Hmm?

19:47.386 --> 19:50.150
Found some new way to humiliate me?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.290
What? What are you talking about?

19:53.759 --> 19:58.093
You may have everyone else around
here fooled but I know the real you.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.394
Underneath that perfect smile,

20:01.099 --> 20:02.999
you're ugly, Betty.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.005
Everything seemed so perfect.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.669
Why does Daniel hate me?

20:15.180 --> 20:18.980
We've been through so much together.
I was his assistant for three years.

20:19.017 --> 20:20.507
Nope. You weren't.

20:20.886 --> 20:24.652
Daniel's dad hired a plain Jane
who wouldn't tempt his son.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.454
And without your braces,
that wasn't you.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.087
So Bradford never hired me?

20:31.196 --> 20:33.630
<i>Well, then how'd I end up at Mode?</i>

20:43.208 --> 20:44.971
I'm really nervous.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.037
Are you interviewing here, too?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.946
Yes. I've always wanted to
work in fashion.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.149
I like your poncho.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.018
Milan, Dolce & Gabbana, fall.

20:56.722 --> 20:59.919
Marc, pull everything we have
on Fabia Cosmetics.

20:59.958 --> 21:03.416
I want to thoroughly humiliate Daniel
at his first meeting tomorrow morning.

21:04.630 --> 21:07.656
- Is that a bug in your teeth?
- Oh, God.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.364
I think it's a poppy seed
from that bagel I ate.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.701
You ate a bagel?

21:19.044 --> 21:23.105
My, what a beautiful,
clean smile you have.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.813
Thank you.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.177
Marc, you've just been
demoted to receptionist.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.148
Pretty Teeth, follow me.

21:36.194 --> 21:38.992
So I was Wilhelmina's assistant?

21:39.031 --> 21:42.592
How would that work?
I mean, we're completely different.

21:43.035 --> 21:46.232
Well, maybe at first,
but you were a quick study.

21:46.471 --> 21:51.101
No, awful. No. Should have been fired.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.737
Hideous, and no.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.840
Beth, do you understand why
I can't even look at you right now?

21:57.883 --> 21:59.942
Don't answer.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.249
Betty, tell her.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.348
Um...

22:08.527 --> 22:11.758
There isn't much flow
from one look to another.

22:11.797 --> 22:15.426
Betty, are you a fashion person or not?
Tell her about the color.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.991
Wilhelmina specifically
asked you for red.

22:18.036 --> 22:19.833
What did you bring us?

22:19.871 --> 22:22.806
No, not red, but burgundy,

22:22.841 --> 22:26.368
candy apple, scarlet, wine, crimson,

22:26.411 --> 22:29.972
blush, vermilion, puce, maroon.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.610
Honestly, Beth, maroon?

22:33.585 --> 22:35.052
Don't stop, Betty.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.351
The only true red in this room

22:37.889 --> 22:39.379
is your face.

22:42.094 --> 22:45.120
Betty, you are officially
my favorite person.

22:46.932 --> 22:49.765
Oh, my God, I'm awful.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.829
Beth can't help her red face,
she has rosacea.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.863
Maybe I was just having a bad day?

22:55.907 --> 22:58.375
Actually, that was a good day.

22:58.410 --> 23:02.244
Yeah, you're kind of a beotch.
I've been trying to tell you.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.728
Betty.

23:23.001 --> 23:24.025
Mother Meade.

23:24.069 --> 23:28.028
Look at you, braving the sunlight
as if it won't burn your flesh.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.906
Clever. I'm a vampire. Well, excuse me
if I don't suck your blood.

23:32.944 --> 23:36.038
It's a little early
to consume that much booze.

23:38.884 --> 23:40.943
Everything is so screwed up.

23:40.986 --> 23:44.285
Claire and Daniel hate me,
Wilhelmina and Marc love me.

23:44.322 --> 23:45.687
Oh, Marc doesn't love you.

23:45.724 --> 23:47.658
What? He couldn't have been nicer.

23:47.692 --> 23:51.651
Well, to your face. Honey, that's
'cause he's terrified of you. Look.

23:52.764 --> 23:56.165
It's like it's her life's mission
to make sure I never get promoted.

23:56.201 --> 24:01.764
I hate her. I hate her
and her stupid, beautiful teeth.

24:05.210 --> 24:06.336
He hates me.

24:06.378 --> 24:10.576
Well, it's not like he was
that crazy about you in your other life.

24:11.416 --> 24:13.611
Well, what about my family?
They seemed happy.

24:13.652 --> 24:15.415
Yeah, about that...

24:17.055 --> 24:18.886
Betty. Hi.

24:22.027 --> 24:26.464
Betty, I need to talk to you.
This is really hard for me,

24:27.165 --> 24:31.261
but you can't be my maid of honor.

24:31.837 --> 24:36.604
I mean, it's my big day and I just want
to be the center of attention for once.

24:36.942 --> 24:38.500
Do you hate me?

24:39.344 --> 24:41.505
No. No, of course not.

24:42.280 --> 24:45.215
I mean, if this is what
you and Bobby want.

24:45.250 --> 24:46.911
Bobby? Who's Bobby?

24:46.952 --> 24:49.477
Talercio. Your fiancé.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.685
That guy I had a crush on
in high school?

24:53.725 --> 24:56.626
Come on, don't tease me.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.221
I'm lucky I found a guy like Abundio.

24:59.264 --> 25:02.062
Abundio?
You're marrying the meat man?

25:02.100 --> 25:05.092
- Isn't he, like, 70?
- He's 61.

25:05.136 --> 25:09.505
- Well, how does Justin feel about this?
- Justin? Who is Justin?

25:10.842 --> 25:12.901
Your son.

25:12.944 --> 25:15.777
What is with you today, Betty? Huh?

25:16.414 --> 25:18.439
I mean, you're my sister
and I look up to you,

25:18.483 --> 25:21.577
but why do you always
have to make me feel bad?

25:22.187 --> 25:23.381
Hilda.

25:24.689 --> 25:27.021
Hilda. Hilda.

25:27.659 --> 25:29.456
Why doesn't she know about Justin?

25:29.494 --> 25:34.056
Well, being the ugly sister is a highly
effective method of birth control.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.900
Thanks to your perfect smile,
Justin never existed.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.331
Ooh, spooky.

25:41.773 --> 25:44.298
- You really are a monster.
- What?

25:44.342 --> 25:47.573
The Million Dollar Bra shoot.
Like you don't know.

25:48.113 --> 25:52.049
Daniel, wait. The bra shoot?
That's today?

25:52.083 --> 25:54.551
Yeah, it's today.
Or it was until you sabotaged it.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.577
No. No, I didn't sabotage it.

25:56.621 --> 26:00.057
The head publicist changed
the bra's schedule on you.

26:01.092 --> 26:02.992
How did you know that?

26:04.429 --> 26:07.887
I didn't. Look, Daniel, I can fix this.

26:07.933 --> 26:10.731
I know Eve's assistant, Alison.
I can get her to help us.

26:10.769 --> 26:13.670
Just give it a rest.
How dumb do you think I am, Betty?

26:13.705 --> 26:16.230
I don't think that you're dumb.

26:16.274 --> 26:20.802
And I don't know what I did
to make you hate me.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.281
But I can assure you,
we are on the same team.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.808
And the last thing I am is a liar.

26:28.887 --> 26:29.945
Oh, yeah?

26:35.060 --> 26:38.052
I can't believe
I ever slept with you, Betty.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.825
Frankly, I can't believe
you slept with him either.

26:43.868 --> 26:46.336
Betty, darling, what are you up to?

26:46.371 --> 26:48.737
Are you changing the plan on me?

26:49.207 --> 26:50.902
Which plan?

26:50.942 --> 26:53.740
I'm sorry.
We have so many plans together.

26:53.778 --> 26:57.305
The ruin the bra shootlhumiliate
Daniel plan.

26:57.382 --> 26:58.747
Oh.

26:59.384 --> 27:01.944
So, I am sabotaging Daniel?

27:01.987 --> 27:04.683
No, we're sabotaging Daniel.

27:06.324 --> 27:08.758
Unless you're going rogue on me.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.488
Betty, we're in this together.

27:10.528 --> 27:13.588
So, just stick with the plan,
and by this time next week,

27:13.632 --> 27:16.795
<i>you and I will be
co-editors in chief of Mode.</i>

27:25.977 --> 27:28.673
I don't believe that
I'm in cahoots with Wilhelmina.

27:28.713 --> 27:31.307
How could having perfect teeth
change me this much?

27:31.349 --> 27:34.079
Well, let me break it down for you,
B- Bomb, all right?

27:34.119 --> 27:36.087
Having braces is hard, right?

27:36.121 --> 27:38.715
People make fun of you
and it hurts your feelings,

27:38.757 --> 27:41.351
which made you compassionate.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.829
Pretty teeth Betty?
People fawned all over her

27:44.863 --> 27:46.558
and it went to her head.

27:46.898 --> 27:48.388
What are you gonna do?

27:50.301 --> 27:51.495
Betty?

27:55.173 --> 27:56.401
Amanda!

27:57.342 --> 27:59.401
Hey, Betty, do you mind?

27:59.444 --> 28:04.211
Yes, I mind. You're in my office.
And you're married.

28:04.249 --> 28:07.650
And this is the last place
Daniel would ever step foot.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.951
Which is why you let TyTy and I
have our private time in here.

28:10.989 --> 28:13.856
Did you want to saddle up?
It's a big desk.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.456
Ew! Ew!

28:16.528 --> 28:19.827
Hey, I never told Derek Jeter
about your side action,

28:19.864 --> 28:23.061
so I expect you to
keep your big, sexy mouth shut.

28:25.403 --> 28:27.496
You eat lunch on that desk?

28:27.872 --> 28:30.636
So, Amanda is cheating on Daniel
in my office?

28:30.675 --> 28:33.542
Yeah. Well, Daniel's
not exactly having a dry spell.

28:33.578 --> 28:37.275
He's all over his assistant right now,
in the copy room. You want to see?

28:37.315 --> 28:40.512
No. No, no, no. I'm good.

28:40.952 --> 28:44.115
- All right.
- So, they're both having affairs?

28:44.155 --> 28:46.885
Wipe the judgey off your face,
Jeter Cheater.

28:46.925 --> 28:51.453
Betty. Thank God. I need $40,000.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.157
- Or I'm a dead man.
- What?

28:55.200 --> 28:59.034
My bookie says if I don't cough up
40 large, he'll break my legs.

28:59.070 --> 29:03.006
Bookie? You lost 40 grand gambling?

29:03.041 --> 29:06.272
You know I've had this mono
on my back since we struck it rich.

29:06.311 --> 29:07.471
You gonna give me the cheddar or not?

29:07.512 --> 29:08.672
<i>Papi.</i>

29:09.614 --> 29:12.947
It's not like I walk around
carrying thousands of

29:13.918 --> 29:18.150
<i>- dollars in my purse.
- There it is. Come to Papi.</i>

29:19.591 --> 29:20.819
My God.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.658
<i>You're a good girl, mija.
Where would I be without you?</i>

29:32.704 --> 29:35.332
- You have to stop doing that. Okay?
- Sorry.

29:35.573 --> 29:37.370
This is terrible.

29:38.309 --> 29:42.837
It can't stay this way. It has to change.
I have to change it back.

29:42.881 --> 29:44.849
- Okay.
- I'm gonna start with Daniel.

29:44.883 --> 29:47.647
- All right.
- I'm gonna go to the Guggenheim.

29:47.685 --> 29:49.380
- I'm gonna talk to Eve.
- Okay.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.752
And I'm gonna get him
the Million Dollar Bra back.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.155
Good, change.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.955
But maybe think about keeping the hair.
I love the hair.

30:01.366 --> 30:05.325
So, you see,
if you could just please find

30:05.370 --> 30:11.639
a teeny tiny teensy bit more time
for us to shoot the bra, then we all win.

30:11.676 --> 30:13.041
We will all be happy.

30:13.077 --> 30:17.571
All I heard was blah blah, shrill,
blah blah, whine, blah blah, beg.

30:18.082 --> 30:20.676
And now I'm hungry for Mexican food.

30:20.718 --> 30:23.653
Alison, get me some tacos!

30:23.688 --> 30:27.988
I'm so sorry.
There is a little problem with the bra.

30:28.026 --> 30:30.324
It seems to be missing.

30:33.331 --> 30:38.462
Okay, I am furious.
Alison, go punch yourself in the neck.

30:38.503 --> 30:42.166
Officer! Officer,
what the hell is going on?

30:42.207 --> 30:43.469
Officer!

31:06.898 --> 31:09.298
Excuse me. Excuse me, I'm sorry.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.532
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

31:11.903 --> 31:14.303
Excuse me. Wilhelmina.

31:14.839 --> 31:16.830
Slacking off on the elliptical, darling?

31:16.875 --> 31:19.343
The bra. What are you doing?

31:19.377 --> 31:21.345
I'm protecting my interest.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.438
The moment
I heard you speaking to Daniel,

31:23.481 --> 31:25.949
I knew you were gonna
stab me in the back.

31:25.984 --> 31:29.613
First I was hurt, but then I realized
of course you'd double-cross me.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.144
You're Betty.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.291
Help. Security. She's stealing the bra!

31:34.325 --> 31:37.226
What? No, I'm not. I'm not!

31:42.100 --> 31:43.727
<i>You're a good girl, mija.</i>

31:43.768 --> 31:45.167
<i>Justin?</i>

31:45.803 --> 31:47.794
<i>You sabotaged me.</i>

32:03.054 --> 32:05.045
I want my old life back.

32:11.229 --> 32:12.457
Betty?

32:13.231 --> 32:15.165
Hey. Are you okay?

32:18.436 --> 32:19.630
Daniel?

32:21.639 --> 32:24.403
Whoa. Hey, hey,
take it easy, take it easy.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.815
I can see.

32:34.852 --> 32:37.514
- Yeah.
- No, no, you don't understand, I...

32:37.555 --> 32:42.015
My braces.
They're back. I got my wish.

32:42.060 --> 32:44.119
Okay, maybe we should
get you to the hospital.

32:44.162 --> 32:46.926
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Where's the bra? Is it still here?

32:46.965 --> 32:48.956
Yeah, but they're about to take it
to the airport.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.195
No, there's still time.
We have to find Eve.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.498
A- Bomb!

32:54.405 --> 32:56.771
No, no, no, hey, no, it's a nickname.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.901
- It's okay. It's all right. Come on.
- Jeez.

33:00.244 --> 33:02.144
Come on, B-Bomb.
Eve's right over here.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.774
- Thank you so much for this.
- No problem.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.512
Hey, weren't you supposed to
get your braces off today?

33:07.552 --> 33:09.417
Yeah, change of plans.

33:09.454 --> 33:11.945
Drag. I know how much
you hate those things.

33:12.023 --> 33:14.719
Well, aside from not being able to
eat corn on the cob, which I love,

33:14.759 --> 33:16.386
it's not so bad.

33:17.495 --> 33:20.225
- Where's the bra?
- It's supposed to be here.

33:20.264 --> 33:21.822
Well, it's not.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.231
Oh, no.

33:26.571 --> 33:28.937
No, no, no, no.

33:45.823 --> 33:47.381
Not this time.

33:47.658 --> 33:48.886
Excuse me.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.592
Excuse me, sorry, sorry. Excuse me.

33:51.896 --> 33:53.295
Wilhelmina.

33:54.899 --> 33:57.060
A little extra cardio
wouldn't hurt, darling.

33:57.101 --> 33:59.661
- The bra. Give it to me.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.468
I'm not gonna let you take it this time.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.265
What the hell?

34:06.310 --> 34:09.404
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

34:09.947 --> 34:12.177
I thought that...

34:12.216 --> 34:14.514
That you were... Like before when...

34:14.886 --> 34:19.255
I hit my head. I don't know, like,
maybe I have a concussion or...

34:20.958 --> 34:24.860
No, no, no, no, no, don't pull it.
I'm stuck.

34:28.866 --> 34:30.527
What is going on here?

34:30.568 --> 34:33.331
I'll tell you what's going on.
Betty is a breast man.

34:33.371 --> 34:37.398
I am not a breast man.
My braces are stuck to the bra.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.342
She ripped my shirt clean off.

34:39.377 --> 34:42.277
I'm standing here with nothing
but a bustier on. It's humiliating.

34:42.313 --> 34:44.975
No, it's genius.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.007
You're bringing back underwear
as outerwear.

34:47.952 --> 34:51.911
Yes. That's what I'm doing.
It's a celebration of the brassiere.

34:51.956 --> 34:53.116
Whoo!

34:55.560 --> 34:56.958
Hey, Betty.

34:57.562 --> 35:00.554
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step away from the bra.

35:00.598 --> 35:05.934
Sir, what don't you understand?
My braces are stuck to the bra.

35:05.970 --> 35:08.837
Well, that bra has to be on a plane
to Cairo within the hour,

35:08.873 --> 35:10.465
whether you're attached to it or not.

35:10.508 --> 35:13.705
Look, you're not shipping
my junior features editor to Cairo.

35:13.744 --> 35:17.271
Yeah, there is one person
who can resolve this and it's Eve.

35:17.315 --> 35:20.216
We have to find Eve. It's all about Eve.

35:20.251 --> 35:23.049
Eve. Eve! Don't go.

35:23.354 --> 35:26.653
You gotta give us more time
to shoot the bra.

35:26.691 --> 35:29.421
Yeah, we can charter a plane
to get it to Cairo.

35:29.794 --> 35:33.992
Look, if you can please just look
beyond this predicament

35:34.031 --> 35:36.056
and look into your heart.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.551
That was unexpected.

35:57.588 --> 35:59.419
And a little painful.

36:01.526 --> 36:04.427
Well, since you've cheered me up,

36:05.830 --> 36:08.492
I will allow you to have the bra
for two hours.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.363
- Yes!
- Not a minute longer.

36:13.838 --> 36:17.205
Thank you. Yay, we did it!

36:17.241 --> 36:19.232
We just need to
get your braces off that thing.

36:19.277 --> 36:22.303
- Is there an orthodontist here?
- Yeah, that's likely.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.871
Me, that's me. Excuse me. I got it.

36:27.151 --> 36:28.584
Dr. Frankel?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.853
Okay, here we go.

36:36.627 --> 36:37.889
Uh-oh.

36:40.064 --> 36:42.589
- It's more complicated than I thought.
- Oh, no.

36:42.633 --> 36:45.727
I can't tell where the bra ends
and the braces begin.

36:45.770 --> 36:48.364
We're gonna have to
just cut the bra apart, then.

36:48.739 --> 36:52.300
- For God's sake, cut Betty apart.
- That bra's worth more than her life.

36:53.244 --> 36:56.771
Well, the only other choice I have
is to remove your braces.

36:57.982 --> 37:01.179
- Now? Like right now?
Now.

37:01.686 --> 37:03.586
In front of everybody?

37:15.633 --> 37:18.796
- Do it.
- All right, let's do it.

37:20.271 --> 37:21.465
Okay.

37:23.007 --> 37:25.066
Hold your mouth right there.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.729
- They're gone?
- They're off.

37:57.475 --> 37:59.340
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

37:59.377 --> 38:01.937
- Is something wrong?
- No, it looks...

38:03.381 --> 38:05.281
Betty, you look great.

38:06.050 --> 38:08.541
Yes, yes, congratulations, Betty.

38:08.586 --> 38:11.054
Your smile will no longer induce
seizures in children.

38:11.088 --> 38:14.057
Now, can we get this show
on the road, please?

38:22.199 --> 38:23.564
Beautiful.

38:42.720 --> 38:47.350
- Hey. How do your teeth feel?
- Weird. Fine. Naked.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.687
- Yeah.
- So, I have to get home.

38:49.727 --> 38:53.060
My family is planning something for me
to celebrate.

39:06.243 --> 39:09.235
Amanda, hey. Can we talk? About us?

39:09.980 --> 39:12.608
Well, you were pretty clear before.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.118
Well, I'm sorry, okay?

39:16.487 --> 39:20.423
I didn't have a right to say that.
You can date whoever you want.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.926
That's what "casual" means, right?

39:23.828 --> 39:25.159
That's...

39:26.597 --> 39:27.996
Thank you.

39:50.454 --> 39:51.887
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:51.922 --> 39:56.757
So, all of those things going wrong,
that wasn't you, was it?

39:56.794 --> 40:00.890
Part of your plot to take over
the company? Making Daniel look bad?

40:01.298 --> 40:03.926
Daniel can do that all by himself.

40:03.968 --> 40:06.436
No, Marc, this shoot is an A cup.

40:06.837 --> 40:10.534
My plan for the Meades, double D.

40:17.148 --> 40:20.811
Hey, did I tell you my brilliant idea?

40:21.385 --> 40:23.046
Million Dollar Thong.

40:23.454 --> 40:25.854
What's with the face?
You don't think it'd be comfortable?

40:25.890 --> 40:27.915
I saw you hugging Daniel.

40:27.958 --> 40:31.189
Oh, cute. You're jealous.

40:31.228 --> 40:33.458
Actually, Daniel and I
just had a really great talk.

40:33.497 --> 40:36.022
And he kind of gave us his blessing.

40:36.066 --> 40:40.526
Wow. So Daniel Meade gave us
his blessing. How generous of him.

40:40.571 --> 40:42.630
Okay, jealousy slightly less cute.

40:42.673 --> 40:45.403
No, I'm just saying that
the guy barely talks to me

40:45.443 --> 40:49.038
and now he thinks that
I need his permission to date you?

40:51.749 --> 40:55.845
Yeah, I think you guys still have
some issues to work out.

40:56.187 --> 41:00.817
And you know what? So do I.
So, why don't we take a little time out

41:00.858 --> 41:03.827
and we can all
work on our own stuff for now.

41:11.836 --> 41:16.000
Tyler? I don't believe we've
officially met. I'm Wilhelmina Slater.

41:16.907 --> 41:19.467
Looks like you could use a drink.

41:19.910 --> 41:22.708
Yeah, I could. But I don't drink.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.818
- Okay, ready?
- Yes.

41:32.122 --> 41:34.317
Surprise!

41:34.992 --> 41:37.085
Surprise!

41:40.531 --> 41:42.795
Yummy.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.162
Isn't that sweet?

41:46.337 --> 41:48.362
- So sweet.
- Can you get that, please?

41:48.405 --> 41:49.463
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.940
Let's see.
