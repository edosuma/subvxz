01:42.519 --> 01:45.637
<i>"For whoever desires
to save his life</i>

01:46.565 --> 01:48.682
<i>"will lose it,</i>

01:50.360 --> 01:52.727
<i>"but whoever loses his life
for my sake,</i>

01:54.156 --> 01:56.193
<i>"will save it.</i>

01:59.328 --> 02:02.196
"I will never leave
the gathered regiment,

02:02.289 --> 02:04.030
"nor flee from any battle.

02:05.584 --> 02:08.543
"And I give them eternal life,

02:09.963 --> 02:12.376
"and they shall never perish,

02:15.177 --> 02:18.796
"neither shall anyone
snatch them out of my hand."

02:19.765 --> 02:23.805
Now what is this about?

02:24.853 --> 02:27.311
We didn't do classes,
my first communion.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.478
Why are the children posed this way?

02:31.568 --> 02:32.900
Prayerful repose

02:32.986 --> 02:36.479
signifies their innocence
and rebirth in Christ.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.735
And why does Will
have his eyes closed?

02:40.077 --> 02:41.193
I don't know.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.656
I suppose he blinked.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.697
Who took these pictures?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.240
I did.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.710
The youth group,

02:51.797 --> 02:53.459
had you talked much with the kids

02:53.548 --> 02:55.255
about their activities
outside the church?

02:55.884 --> 02:58.877
Ever about their home lives,
new acquaintances?

03:00.347 --> 03:03.681
I didn't often see
their parents at service,

03:03.767 --> 03:06.635
and then usually it was
just the father, Tom.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.937
Actually, last I saw her,

03:10.023 --> 03:12.640
Julie had been excited
about seeing an aunt.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.894
She doesn't have any aunts.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.070
Tell you anything about this aunt?

03:18.156 --> 03:19.488
Description?

03:19.574 --> 03:21.941
Something might draw notice?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.324
She told the woman's name.
I wish I could recollect it.

03:25.414 --> 03:26.996
We'd be grateful for names,

03:27.082 --> 03:29.665
other people who worked
with the youth group.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.743
Like to get some fingerprints, too.

03:31.837 --> 03:32.837
Certainly.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.332
Any of this stuff look familiar?

03:39.177 --> 03:41.134
That's a chaff doll.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.383
Patty Faber makes them
for our fall fair,

03:43.473 --> 03:45.556
first week in October.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.680
She's a dear, good woman,
I can tell you.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.772
You were Catholic.
Do you attend services?

03:58.029 --> 03:59.736
Sometimes.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.406
Remiss of late.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.360
I was an altar boy,
little country church in Conway.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.831
Well, even abiding in the dark,
we implore a steadfast faith,

04:09.916 --> 04:12.624
assured His hand is at work.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.755
Anything else about the kids?

04:17.841 --> 04:23.087
Just that they were sweet children,
and they looked out for each other.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.844
I don't like him.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.017
The priest.

04:30.896 --> 04:35.607
I know his alibi's good,
but I don't like him.

04:36.359 --> 04:40.273
Man signs up to
go without fuckin' for life,

04:40.363 --> 04:43.026
either he don't know himself
for a liar,

04:43.116 --> 04:47.235
or he's some tight,
limited-edition psycho, you know?

04:48.121 --> 04:52.365
I mean,
everybody's fuckin' somethin'.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.711
You can imagine that little boy
looking out for his sister, huh?

05:01.885 --> 05:03.922
He was trying to defend her.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.505
That's what happened to him.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.056
Maybe whoever they were
playing with in the woods,

05:10.936 --> 05:13.553
maybe this new aunt or whoever,

05:14.898 --> 05:17.015
they never wanted the boy.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.230
My feeling,

05:20.320 --> 05:21.936
it was all about the girl.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.245
Catholic, huh?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.867
Yep.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.494
We were Baptist.

05:35.836 --> 05:40.080
Had a good buddy in the war. Baptist.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.584
What happened to him?

06:00.777 --> 06:04.270
Look forward to meeting Patty Faber.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.447
A dear, good woman.

06:10.662 --> 06:14.076
Yes, I'm pretty sure these are mine.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.282
Just little things I do.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.039
Somebody bought 'em. Do you know who?

06:19.129 --> 06:25.501
Well, the last I sold these myself
was at the fair in October.

06:26.219 --> 06:30.259
I'd only sold a couple,
and then one man bought 10 off me.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.805
That was nice.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.679
You know who he was?

06:34.769 --> 06:36.510
You remember anything about him?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.935
Didn't recognize him.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.893
Negro man, like yourself.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.149
He had a dead eye.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.900
Filmy, you know, like a cataracts?

06:49.993 --> 06:52.280
Nothing 'bout his face
besides the eye?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.325
Handsome, ugly?

06:55.415 --> 06:59.750
Well, like I say, he was black.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.880
You speak to him at all?
He say what the dolls were for?

07:04.966 --> 07:09.461
Well, I asked, and I think he said
he had nieces and nephews.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.848
That man,

07:14.935 --> 07:16.927
any chance he mentioned
where they live?

07:17.020 --> 07:18.556
No.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.936
Well, I just assume that would
have been with the rest of them

07:22.025 --> 07:25.018
over at the tracks in Davis Junction.

07:26.655 --> 07:27.691
Thank you, ma'am.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.049
Special investigator.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.380
New detail.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.807
Roland's in charge, he wants me on it.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.895
They're reopening the Purcell case.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.811
How 'bout that, right?

08:06.069 --> 08:08.231
Yeah, but this time
we get to close it.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.608
Actually get to do my job again.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.992
Good. I'm happy for you.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.615
That what happy looks like?

08:17.706 --> 08:19.493
I've been doing it wrong
all these years.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.620
I'm happy for you like you were happy
for me the other night.

08:22.711 --> 08:23.747
Oh.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.412
Oh, good.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.623
'Cause of course no mistake,

08:28.717 --> 08:31.551
no slip of temper could possibly occur

08:31.636 --> 08:34.379
without me paying double interest
for it at a later date.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.216
You could just apologize.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.640
I'm sorry.

08:40.227 --> 08:41.764
I'm sorry I haven't expressed better

08:41.855 --> 08:44.723
how inadequate and useless
I've been made to feel.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.683
Yeah, "made to feel."

08:47.777 --> 08:51.487
You're this person
who things just happen to.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.532
Your job, your marriage,

08:54.617 --> 08:57.781
your family, your feelings...

08:57.871 --> 09:00.158
Everything's just happening to you.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.207
You're this grown man
with no agency of his own.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.876
Fate just keeps
throwing him curveballs.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.626
How awful for you,
these trials and vicissitudes.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.133
Look it up.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.383
When have I ever not been
stand-up for you and our family?

09:16.473 --> 09:18.965
I try, you see me tryin'.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.393
There's guys, they're barely around.
They get girlfriends.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.766
I wish you would.
Get a girlfriend, please.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.189
I'm not the one my head in the clouds
the last five years.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.811
"Oh, I'm gonna be a great writer.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.566
"Let me just use this awful tragedy
to take myself on to better things,"

09:32.655 --> 09:34.759
because you always gotta be
on your way to better things.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.366
At least I have some kind of drive.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.614
I can't even say
what moves you anymore.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.580
I think you stay upright out of habit.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.998
This walking wounded, "poor me."

09:45.085 --> 09:46.747
Let me ask you something.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.292
You guys okay?

09:55.386 --> 09:56.877
- Yeah, Dad.
- Yeah, Dad.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.687
Do not talk shit to my face
and walk away.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.689
I don't want to be
around you right now.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.522
You want me to leave you alone,
then stop talking shit.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.358
'Cause when you talk shit about me,
I'm required to defend myself.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.571
How can you defend yourself?

10:19.661 --> 10:22.529
You can't defend yourself
because you don't know what's wrong.

10:22.622 --> 10:26.161
Did the wife in your scenario
play any part in the conflict,

10:26.251 --> 10:27.492
any role the last 10 years?

10:27.585 --> 10:28.585
Let go of me, Wayne.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.831
Stop talkin' shit about me.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.162
Or what?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.172
Or I'm gonna start cryin'.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.597
Well, that's a first.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.372
Thinking we can't
understand each other,

10:46.396 --> 10:48.012
we're never gonna.

10:52.277 --> 10:56.487
Oh, great, Wayne.
Walk away. Surprise, surprise.

10:56.573 --> 11:00.112
What do you want me to do, huh?
You want me to yell some more?

11:00.201 --> 11:01.804
You want me to hit you?
You want me to fuck you?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.114
Just give me my orders, Major.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.204
I want to finish this.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.781
All on your schedule, I guess.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.413
Be happy when you say.
Fight when you say.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.619
Talk when you say.
Fuck every so often.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.969
Well, how 'bout right now?

11:21.055 --> 11:22.055
What?

11:27.687 --> 11:28.973
How 'bout right now?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.853
You got some major
cognitive dissonance.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.793
Guess we 'bout six years old, huh?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.045
I don't think bad of you.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.598
What I was saying...
I didn't mean that.

12:09.187 --> 12:10.428
Me, neither.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.105
Want to just do a house-to-house?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.901
That'd be fun.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.230
I thought we'd just start
at the liquor store.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.366
Pretty fuckin' racist, man.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.621
And it's one of three businesses here
'cause nobody uses it.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.787
Let's flip for it.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.548
All we know,
man's got a dead eye.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.170
Filmy-like.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.344
Sound like anybody in the community?

13:28.599 --> 13:31.342
Having us owe you a favor
could be worthwhile,

13:31.853 --> 13:34.140
find yourself
in a difficult position ever,

13:34.230 --> 13:35.562
police.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.934
He's always been a good customer,

13:42.280 --> 13:44.192
but you,

13:44.282 --> 13:45.898
talkin' 'bout that dead eye.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.412
Sam Whitehead got one of them.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.705
Where's he live?

13:56.294 --> 13:58.286
<i>That trailer park
off of Central Avenue.</i>

14:23.821 --> 14:25.653
Mr. Whitehead.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.407
Wonder could we talk to you a minute?

14:29.118 --> 14:30.905
Well, what's this about?

14:30.995 --> 14:33.237
Could we step inside, sir?

14:36.209 --> 14:39.043
I'd rather stay out here,
if it's all the same to you.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.583
You ever go to mass?

14:42.006 --> 14:43.793
St. Michael's Church?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.467
No, I go to First Presbyterian.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.635
You go
to their church fair, maybe?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.634
Buy some dolls made out of straw?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.558
What? No!

14:55.436 --> 14:56.517
What the hell is this?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.266
What y'all tryin' to do to me?

14:58.356 --> 14:59.938
Just runnin' down a couple of details.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.686
Case we're workin'.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.233
Dead boy, missin' girl.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.945
You might have seen it in the papers.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.863
White children.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.529
If it's in the paper,
it's white children.

15:12.703 --> 15:16.162
Knowin' we're not gonna solve
the racial complexities of our day

15:16.249 --> 15:17.785
here in your front yard,

15:19.419 --> 15:22.253
maybe you could tell us
where you were the night of the 7th?

15:22.338 --> 15:26.082
Where was I?
Where you tryin' to say I was?

15:27.343 --> 15:28.925
Y'all come over here!

15:29.011 --> 15:31.754
Come watch these nefarious men,
what they's tryin' to do to me!

15:31.848 --> 15:34.556
What's goin' on, Mr. Whitehead?

15:35.393 --> 15:36.804
And you...

15:36.894 --> 15:39.557
How you gonna wear that badge?

15:39.647 --> 15:41.604
It's got a little clip on it.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.731
Off on the wrong foot here.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.382
It's just a few questions,
Mr. Whitehead.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.942
Why y'all messin' with old Sam?

15:50.032 --> 15:51.677
- Leave him alone.
- Be cool, y'all.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.658
It's nothin'. So far.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.237
Might not stay that way,
certain people don't back the fuck up.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.351
- Knock it off with that shit.
- Y'all heard that?

15:59.375 --> 16:01.082
Peckerwood lookin' to shoot somebody!

16:01.169 --> 16:02.910
Ain't nobody call for the police.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.620
Where were you the night of the 7th?

16:04.714 --> 16:06.706
Right here. My house.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.131
They tryin' to fix me up!

16:08.217 --> 16:09.987
Them white children on the news!

16:10.011 --> 16:11.738
You know they tryin'
to put that on a nigger!

16:11.762 --> 16:13.378
God damn it, calm the fuck down!

16:14.557 --> 16:16.048
Hey, hey! No, no! Roland!

16:20.480 --> 16:22.767
Stir up enough of this shit,
somebody gon' get hurt.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.849
And brother, it ain't gon' be us.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.233
You talk to us
here or at the station,

16:27.320 --> 16:28.527
but you're talkin'.

16:30.573 --> 16:33.407
Lookin' for a black male
with one dead eye.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.446
You know anybody like that, Sam?

16:35.536 --> 16:37.198
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.280
I work for a goddamn living.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.739
Two jobs, when I can get 'em.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.451
I haul freight for the railroad,
and I trap.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.458
You fittin' to shoot me now?

16:47.548 --> 16:49.380
You spend any time
at Devil's Den?

16:49.467 --> 16:51.003
I do not.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.426
Anybody verify you were here
the night of the 7th?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.846
Most of the people on my goddamn lawn.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.140
I ain't the only one-eyed nigger
in these parts.

16:59.393 --> 17:03.182
Farm work,
killin' line at the chicken plant.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.229
You know anybody else with one eye?

17:05.316 --> 17:06.932
Half the motherfuckers
out here missin'

17:07.026 --> 17:09.108
fingers, toes, ear, somethin'!

17:12.656 --> 17:15.240
Go ahead and shoot me now.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.488
See how this goes first.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.704
- Come out here!
- Take it easy.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.951
Nobody gettin' hurt today.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.532
Tell 'em, Mr. Whitehead.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.627
It's all right so far, y'all.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.579
But everybody be careful.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.748
This white man wanna shoot somebody.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.378
Don't take it personally.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.720
Oh, that's fuckin' perfect!

17:47.900 --> 17:49.436
Believe this shit?

17:50.194 --> 17:53.562
I mean, bit of an overreaction,
don't you think?

17:59.745 --> 18:02.237
Would you have done it?

18:03.165 --> 18:05.327
Would you have shot one of 'em?

18:05.418 --> 18:08.001
If I thought it was
between him and me.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.501
And no, I could give a fuck
what color he was.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.004
Sure about that?

18:15.094 --> 18:18.553
Fact these were black folks
probably gave me more pause.

18:19.765 --> 18:23.850
Mob of white people surrounds me,
smashes up my ride,

18:23.936 --> 18:26.679
be a lot less hesitation what I'd do.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.030
Can we say this was anonymous vandals?

18:48.586 --> 18:51.374
We're not goin' with "irate Negros"?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.465
When I was on the force in the '80s,

19:02.558 --> 19:05.642
that woman could do more push-ups
than anybody in the department.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.348
- Hey.
- All right.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.894
She here's a good woman.

19:14.987 --> 19:18.526
We had a fat guy that smoked Viceroys
one after another in my day.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.256
What's goin' on, Dad?
Why didn't you call?

19:20.284 --> 19:22.196
- I'd have come to you.
- Take it easy.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.323
I didn't drive. I grabbed a bus.

19:24.914 --> 19:28.157
I'm just sayin', you take a bus,
what happens you forget to get off?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.788
What happens you don't remember
why you even got on?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.835
I hold down this button.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.254
It calls you.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.070
Think I oughta walk around
with a note or somethin'?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.630
Whatever you think is best.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.712
I don't wanna get arrogant
with this thing.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.431
What ya got there?

19:46.811 --> 19:48.177
You know, I...

19:48.270 --> 19:50.478
I been workin' on this thing.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.022
Writin'. About the case.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.771
Both times,
the first one and the second.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.568
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, so...

19:57.655 --> 20:00.773
I been goin' through old files
and writin' stuff down

20:00.866 --> 20:02.448
and recording stuff, so I remember.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.243
What's the point,
you lookin' at old case notes?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.242
Writing's been good for me.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.245
Maybe I got a book in there
or somethin',

20:11.335 --> 20:13.135
or maybe it's nothin'
and don't mean anything,

20:13.212 --> 20:16.171
but it's been good for me.
My head, I mean.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.590
You don't need
to do that show anymore.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.713
I'm not talkin' about the show.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.341
It's me. It's my life.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.265
Tell myself the story,
I tell the case in steps,

20:26.350 --> 20:28.683
and I'm rememberin'.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.385
Rememberin' my life.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.808
Goin' along with all that,

20:34.275 --> 20:37.518
I found a couple of people and details

20:37.611 --> 20:40.945
I was wonderin' if maybe
you could look up for me?

20:41.031 --> 20:43.364
Man, Dad, I don't think so.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.408
I really need your help here.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.486
Where else I'm gonna go
than Detective Hays?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.662
Look at it.

20:50.666 --> 20:54.125
Just a few names and people
I'd like to see where they ended up

20:54.211 --> 20:56.669
and never got around
to gettin' everything from.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.588
And Roland.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.007
What I really need is
for you to find Roland.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.335
Roland? Jesus, Dad, come on.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.716
I need his memory, son.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.012
I'm bein' straight with you,
man to man.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.768
Knowin' I had a place here, as you do.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.359
This right now is

21:20.696 --> 21:22.938
my way of stayin' alive.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.033
This can't be a habit
or anything, all right?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.498
Yes, sir.

21:35.336 --> 21:36.952
Thank you, son.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.666
Roland... He's not dead, is he?

21:42.760 --> 21:45.093
I guess I'll find out.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.506
How are you otherwise?

21:50.643 --> 21:53.761
One of my good days. Pretty clear.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.891
Be a good day for that director
to catch me.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.602
You seen her since?

21:58.692 --> 22:00.558
The director? Elisa?

22:01.445 --> 22:02.686
Since the last day, I mean?

22:04.114 --> 22:08.529
No, not since she pulled that shit,
criticizin' the investigation.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.995
Okay, son.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.646
Now look, Dad, I'm gonna see
what I can do about some of these,

22:17.670 --> 22:21.129
and I'll try to find where Roland is,
if he's still around.

22:21.215 --> 22:22.831
I appreciate it.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.045
Come on, Pop. I'll drive you back.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.185
Uh-huh.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.353
Yeah, that's right.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.607
Yes, sir.

22:42.069 --> 22:45.733
Well, that'd be my preference,
and you'd have my gratitude.

22:47.283 --> 22:48.990
Thank you, now.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.662
We're good with Sallisaw PD.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.215
Roland.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.711
Major.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.879
Lieutenant West.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.212
Mr. Attorney General.

23:16.020 --> 23:19.730
Roland, A.G. Kindt
wanted to reiterate our cause.

23:20.566 --> 23:24.150
All the evidence at the time pointed
to the Purcell girl bein' dead.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.149
And whether
or not this was the case,

23:27.239 --> 23:30.232
state and county offices
remain convinced of the man's guilt.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.534
The mandate of this unit
is to vindicate

23:32.620 --> 23:35.203
the original conviction
for Will Purcell's murder.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.706
Understood.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.409
Officer Hays,
I know it's been some time

23:41.503 --> 23:44.712
since you've been involved
in an investigative unit.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.414
Roland had to do
considerable campaigning

23:46.508 --> 23:50.001
to get you to be a part of this.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.633
I'm hopin' your involvement
does not portend

23:52.723 --> 23:54.806
to any damage to his reputation.

23:55.351 --> 23:56.745
And I further hope, Officer,

23:56.769 --> 23:58.135
that you might use this new role

23:58.228 --> 24:01.812
to redeem
an unfortunately stunted career.

24:05.736 --> 24:09.696
I'm committed to fulfillin' the
mandates just described to us, sir.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.273
Good.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.404
This is all brought to conclusion,

24:14.453 --> 24:16.410
I could imagine you
back at Major Crimes.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.543
Sir.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.262
We're not gonna do any of that shit
they just said, right?

24:43.107 --> 24:45.349
Wasn't plannin' on it.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.860
<i>How right that today</i>

24:57.746 --> 25:01.581
His Word to us promises justice.

25:02.918 --> 25:07.288
Promises us liberation from the weight

25:08.298 --> 25:11.211
of time and flesh.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.842
And He tells us today,
the reading from Malachi...

25:18.559 --> 25:22.269
"Justice is not ours to deliver.

25:24.106 --> 25:27.770
"Justice is not in our power,

25:27.860 --> 25:29.567
"it is in His."

25:32.781 --> 25:36.115
Having said as much, I would like
to ask you all for your help today.

25:37.619 --> 25:41.078
After services, the police
will have set up some tables,

25:41.165 --> 25:43.623
and I dearly hope
you will assist them.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.219
Right hand.

25:57.181 --> 26:00.470
I didn't see no one-eyed
brother, but I'll tell you this,

26:01.351 --> 26:04.014
there's some serious ass up in here.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.805
I gotta get back to church.

26:11.528 --> 26:14.236
Well, don't mind me.
I'll just hang back.

26:19.161 --> 26:21.118
Excuse me, miss?

26:21.538 --> 26:23.325
Thanks for
helpin' us with this.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.200
I don't know anybody'd do it
without your askin'.

26:26.293 --> 26:29.377
Of course.
We'll keep it up through Sunday.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.250
I noticed
you didn't take the Eucharist.

26:31.340 --> 26:34.083
I'd need to hit confession first.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.168
Would you like to confess now?

26:36.261 --> 26:39.174
I reckon
I'll let it pile up a little more.

26:41.892 --> 26:43.428
Can you tell me,

26:43.519 --> 26:46.136
any member of your congregation
a black man with a dead eye?

26:46.230 --> 26:49.098
- Like a cataract?
- Offhand, I don't believe so,

26:49.191 --> 26:51.774
but we have
over 1,000 parishioners,

26:51.860 --> 26:55.695
and I regret to say only
a small portion are African-American.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.612
Thing of it is, Father,

26:59.701 --> 27:03.615
we're about 90% sure
whoever took Julie, hurt Will,

27:03.705 --> 27:05.492
they're one of y'all's.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.619
I find it difficult to believe

27:07.709 --> 27:09.509
that anyone here
could do something like that.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.954
They don't exactly wear signboards,
say "psycho-killer."

27:15.259 --> 27:18.297
Be a great help to us,
keep an eye out.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.174
Maybe ask around
about the man I described.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.969
I'll certainly try,
and pray to be of use.

27:25.394 --> 27:29.058
I really would like
to hear your confession, Detective.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.856
I get to feelin' penitent,
I'll let you know.

27:35.988 --> 27:39.106
I think faith is one
of the most important things there is,

27:39.199 --> 27:40.815
you ask me.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.696
Well, that's nice.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.654
- Ready?
- Yeah.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.659
I'll see you next week, Miss Lori.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.149
- See you then.
- All right.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.210
Holy Spirit workin' out for you?

27:57.301 --> 28:00.885
God is love, brother. God is love.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.945
- Beer man.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.824
Only when I need my wits about me.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.593
I started thinking,

28:48.018 --> 28:52.058
Will's death...
Could it have been an accident?

28:55.359 --> 28:57.976
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
bring your office home.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.859
- It's okay.
- My whole life, I speak, I regret.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.774
Never regret on my account.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.951
How'd you do with California?

29:15.128 --> 29:17.245
It was all steers and queers, man.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.380
Lotta people,

29:25.013 --> 29:28.347
ideas,

29:28.433 --> 29:30.174
lotta confusion.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.807
Figure that stops at the state lines?

29:32.896 --> 29:35.354
Good bit of that confusion was mine.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.729
Can I tell you a secret?

29:41.655 --> 29:43.237
I used to be something of a mess.

29:44.533 --> 29:48.152
That might be the least
surprisin' thing I've ever heard.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.530
What about you?

29:53.500 --> 29:55.787
Your clip-on ties as crazy as you get?

29:55.877 --> 29:57.709
Oh. God, no.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.380
But I'd like to
pretend normal with you,

30:04.469 --> 30:06.210
for as long as I can.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.341
So later on, it'll be a surprise.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.683
How much later on were you thinking?

30:30.746 --> 30:32.988
I found this spot
they played in the woods.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.035
They were meetin' somebody,

30:36.126 --> 30:38.163
the kids out there.

30:40.922 --> 30:42.538
Somebody gave 'em toys.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.377
It's where the boy died.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.222
The way Will's body was...

30:55.062 --> 30:57.270
How you were saying the toys...

30:59.316 --> 31:02.150
It's almost as if there was
an element of affection in it,

31:02.235 --> 31:03.771
don't you think?

31:03.862 --> 31:06.980
People who hurt kids
think of themselves

31:07.074 --> 31:09.612
as having affection for the children,

31:09.701 --> 31:12.318
even up to the
fuckin'-'em-and-murderin'-'em part.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.799
You want a do-over?

31:35.602 --> 31:37.309
Where do they give those out?

31:40.732 --> 31:42.769
Tell me about your family.

31:47.197 --> 31:48.938
Mom was country.

31:50.492 --> 31:53.906
Chopped wood, killed chickens,
build you a barn.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.948
Worked a farm as a domestic.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.202
I worked the fields, time I was eight.

32:06.216 --> 32:08.082
Dad?

32:08.176 --> 32:10.168
You need to get that information
somewheres else.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.850
You?

32:20.772 --> 32:22.263
Me what?

32:23.400 --> 32:26.313
I'd like a full presentation
on your background.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.319
Keepin' in mind
I'm a trained interrogator.

32:30.907 --> 32:32.489
You're my first police.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.526
You gonna rough me up?

32:36.830 --> 32:38.992
Nowhere on my list
of things to do with you.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.744
You got a list?

32:40.834 --> 32:42.496
More detailed by the minute.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.878
I didn't mean to overstep. I'm sorry.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.218
You apologize a lot?

32:57.893 --> 32:59.555
I could start.

33:02.147 --> 33:04.935
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

33:07.068 --> 33:08.730
I don't know.

33:09.613 --> 33:11.900
Memories of other women
are gettin' hazy now.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.731
Oh, brother.

33:14.743 --> 33:17.110
You hear about cops
being pussy hounds.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.287
I don't like that word.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.739
Unless it's describing a man.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.542
What word do you use?

33:25.295 --> 33:26.411
"Dick holster."

33:36.139 --> 33:37.721
You never answered.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.383
You see many girls?

33:44.731 --> 33:45.892
Sometimes.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.484
Don't seem to last for long, though.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.147
I don't plan it that way.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.243
I have a mental handicap.

34:04.417 --> 34:07.581
The other stuff don't work for me
without this.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.773
Wanna trace fingers?

34:30.443 --> 34:32.605
That can be kind of fun.

34:35.447 --> 34:37.565
I'd like to make you laugh.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.275
I'll have to catch my breath.

34:41.788 --> 34:44.326
Shit, you're pretty good at this.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.123
I can see you being a real dog.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.670
That's down to you.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.629
I have no idea what I'm doin'.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.142
He started hollerin',

35:55.236 --> 35:57.979
broke a glass, made some accusations,

35:58.073 --> 35:59.939
took a swing at Kenny.

36:00.033 --> 36:03.071
Had your card
from when y'all talked to me.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.323
What's goin' on, Mr. Purcell?

36:06.790 --> 36:09.407
Doin' my Bozo the Clown act,

36:09.501 --> 36:12.915
since everybody thinks
I'm so fuckin' funny.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.793
She was fuckin' him, you know.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.800
Her boss.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.504
Shit, you're a detective,

36:24.891 --> 36:27.679
you probably figured that out already.

36:27.769 --> 36:30.386
Why didn't you call his wife?

36:30.480 --> 36:33.268
Lucy's got enough problems right now.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.357
Could press charges on you, Tom,

36:38.446 --> 36:40.733
but I sympathize,
what your family's goin' through.

36:42.283 --> 36:43.649
Fuck you.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.589
I'm such a joke.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.679
You didn't need
the one nigger cop on the job

37:05.765 --> 37:07.301
to help babysit me?

37:07.976 --> 37:10.389
He's the best detective on the case.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.971
Tryin' to find your daughter.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.984
I apologize.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.529
That word I used.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.915
Your pal wanted to kick my ass,
he'd have the right.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.748
You've gotten your ass
kicked enough for now.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.714
You takin' me home?

37:44.804 --> 37:46.420
Yeah.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.427
I can't be in that house, man.

37:55.231 --> 37:57.894
Every inch of that place is them kids.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.821
I can't be there.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.614
I can't sleep there.

38:09.954 --> 38:14.449
I just wanna die all the time.

38:24.677 --> 38:29.388
I got a jail cell for you,
or I got a couch.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.971
Why don't you use that?

38:33.061 --> 38:35.223
Then we see how tomorrow looks.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.557
Oh, my God.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.643
I'm so sorry I used that word.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.071
Don't tell him.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.901
He been called worse
by people meant it more than you did.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.666
I'm sorry for that, too.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.157
First thing.

39:30.243 --> 39:33.862
You two, go over every statement
taken back then.

39:33.955 --> 39:38.290
I want y'all finding current addresses
for any residents we talked to in '80,

39:38.376 --> 39:40.868
anybody from that neighborhood.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.045
Detective Hays here
was lead at the time.

39:43.131 --> 39:46.169
He's come over from Public Information
to help us out.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.299
We had a couple of threads
we were just getting started

39:50.388 --> 39:52.129
before the whole thing
closed out on us.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.759
What we got that's brand-new

39:53.850 --> 39:55.619
is the missing girl's prints
showed up in Oklahoma.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.635
Now, we're gonna have to...

39:57.729 --> 39:59.766
Wayne's gonna
try to help me find her.

39:59.856 --> 40:03.770
We figure find the girl,
who by now is 21 years old,

40:03.860 --> 40:06.193
we get the story of what happened.

40:06.279 --> 40:09.272
Now, everything pointed
to her bein' dead.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.231
We were wrong.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.283
Let's find out why.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.985
I don't know about "we."

40:18.291 --> 40:21.375
Her mother Lucy, she's dead. We knew.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.828
OD'd outside Vegas, '88.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.164
She had a cousin, Dan O'Brien.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.420
Nobody knows where he is.

40:28.509 --> 40:31.627
Hobbs, Segar, focus on findin' him.

40:31.721 --> 40:35.305
Mainly, y'all seekin'
anything might have got overlooked.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.633
All the tips, interrogations, whatnot.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.807
Yeah. You in the back.

40:45.401 --> 40:46.983
A secondary consideration.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.298
If word's out now this girl's alive,

40:49.322 --> 40:51.405
there's a real possibility
there's people somewhere

40:51.491 --> 40:53.232
don't want that to remain the case.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.443
Imagine she escaped somewhere,

40:55.536 --> 40:57.698
imagine we're not the only ones
lookin' for her.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.576
There's any chance that's the case,

40:59.666 --> 41:01.123
I think it's like the last time,

41:01.209 --> 41:02.769
we gotta figure
there's a tickin' clock.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.125
He's not wrong.

41:07.215 --> 41:10.504
May not be right, but he's not wrong.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.006
All right, let's get to it. Come on.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.141
We goin' to Sallisaw?

41:27.610 --> 41:29.226
Yeah.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.615
Hi.

41:42.709 --> 41:44.120
Mind if we talk a little?

42:02.186 --> 42:04.052
Hope I didn't interrupt anything.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.271
You and a friend.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.815
No, I'm alone.

42:09.736 --> 42:11.443
My mistake.

42:11.529 --> 42:15.364
I get confused, as you by now know.

42:17.827 --> 42:19.739
Sit. Please.

42:21.831 --> 42:23.618
Well, what can I do for you?

42:26.335 --> 42:28.215
I kind of had the impression
after our last talk

42:28.296 --> 42:30.083
you might be done with me.

42:30.173 --> 42:32.039
It's all right.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.591
Thing is,

42:34.677 --> 42:37.135
you shared some details I didn't have.

42:38.514 --> 42:41.882
It's clear you have some kind
of investigator workin' this.

42:41.976 --> 42:45.265
We have researchers,
a couple of investigators, sure.

42:45.938 --> 42:48.180
And you'd like to
talk to me some more?

42:48.274 --> 42:51.938
Since we haven't addressed
the conclusion of our efforts in '80,

42:52.028 --> 42:57.114
much less '90, which to me
is more hauntin' than anything.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.236
Yeah.

42:58.326 --> 43:00.158
Of course,
I want to keep talking to you.

43:00.244 --> 43:03.078
So you want to talk to me,
I want to talk to you.

43:03.164 --> 43:04.746
All right, great.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.494
But, miss,

43:06.584 --> 43:08.701
you're gonna have to show yours, too.

43:09.378 --> 43:11.415
- How do you mean?
- I mean, I wanna know

43:11.506 --> 43:15.045
anything and everything
your people pulled together.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.296
Why are you doing this now?

43:17.804 --> 43:20.592
You got some idea
what happened to the girl?

43:20.681 --> 43:22.547
Are you trying to work this?

43:22.642 --> 43:25.635
I wanna know the whole story.

43:26.062 --> 43:28.520
A lot of this is my life.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.815
Got some pieces I'm missin'.
I need 'em.

43:41.202 --> 43:43.945
Drained quarry in southern Missouri.

43:44.038 --> 43:47.657
Dental records from prison
identify the remains as Dan O'Brien,

43:48.084 --> 43:50.542
Lucy's cousin who went missing in '90
after resurfacing.

43:54.465 --> 43:55.706
This it?

43:57.635 --> 44:00.469
Look, I can't show you
all my cards just yet.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.763
But it's not on you.

44:14.026 --> 44:17.064
Should you happen
to see my son Henry,

44:17.155 --> 44:20.774
it'd be best for both of us
you didn't mention this exchange.

44:21.993 --> 44:25.236
Are you sure you're not trying
to investigate this again?

44:25.621 --> 44:28.864
That'd be a job for somebody who knows
where he is most of the time.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.004
We're puttin' an APB
on the description,

44:40.094 --> 44:41.175
person of interest.

44:41.762 --> 44:43.424
Between the pose, the dolls,

44:43.514 --> 44:46.302
and why we think this has
something to do with the church.

44:46.392 --> 44:48.930
That's strange,
the body position bein' the same.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.807
That, and the toys.

44:50.897 --> 44:52.763
Playin' out in the woods,
this new "aunt."

44:53.441 --> 44:55.103
Doll guy mentionin'
nieces and nephews,

44:55.193 --> 44:56.809
little notes in her room.

44:58.112 --> 45:00.229
There's an aspect we're not catching.

45:00.323 --> 45:02.406
We're tryin' to print
the whole congregation.

45:02.491 --> 45:03.572
Speaking of.

45:03.659 --> 45:06.072
Still no match
on that bicycle's prints.

45:06.162 --> 45:08.223
We just had our guy
start comparing to student files.

45:08.247 --> 45:10.034
There was this program
a couple years ago,

45:10.124 --> 45:11.268
all the kids got theirs done.

45:11.292 --> 45:12.828
What about the note?

45:12.919 --> 45:16.003
Matched magazine ads to the letters,
but no real action there.

45:16.088 --> 45:19.081
Processing public mailboxes
that ZIP code,

45:19.175 --> 45:20.711
but it's not gonna come to anything.

45:20.801 --> 45:22.793
Thought to look at the toys
from the woods.

45:23.304 --> 45:26.513
Call around, see what shops
sell those specific.

45:26.974 --> 45:29.216
We've still got those
unknown prints from 'em, too.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.639
Another thing.

45:31.729 --> 45:35.518
How 'bout workplace injuries
going back 40 years?

45:35.608 --> 45:39.318
Anybody lost an eye, black male,
Washington and surrounding counties.

45:39.403 --> 45:40.769
That's kind of thin.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.818
Any priors from that list of employees

45:43.908 --> 45:46.696
at the Hoyt Foods plant
where the mother worked?

45:46.786 --> 45:48.869
Cross-reference
with workplace injuries.

45:48.955 --> 45:51.823
You heard your prosecutor's
going on <i>Donahue?</i>

45:53.834 --> 45:55.791
What the fuck is a <i>Donahue?</i>

45:56.796 --> 45:58.287
<i>Is the caller there?</i>

45:58.381 --> 45:59.941
<i>- Yes.
- Go right ahead, please.</i>

45:59.966 --> 46:02.083
<i>Mr. Kindt, in your experience,</i>

46:02.176 --> 46:03.758
<i>do you think that dangers to children</i>

46:03.844 --> 46:05.881
<i>have gotten worse over the years?</i>

46:05.972 --> 46:08.680
<i>Well, I think children
are at considerable risk.</i>

46:08.766 --> 46:10.928
<i>I mean, it's no secret that our values</i>

46:11.018 --> 46:12.975
<i>have lowered significantly
as a society</i>

46:13.062 --> 46:14.803
<i>and, in that environment,</i>

46:14.897 --> 46:17.731
<i>certain people
feel emboldened to prey on children.</i>

46:18.484 --> 46:20.191
Dickhead wants attorney general.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.986
<i>Now, this crime
is our number one priority.</i>

46:23.072 --> 46:24.859
<i>And we'll be back
in just a minute.</i>

46:24.949 --> 46:26.736
It's beyond the fuckin' pale.

46:26.826 --> 46:29.068
Forget it. We got a hit on the bike.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.527
What? Who?

46:30.621 --> 46:31.907
That Black Sunday teenager...

46:31.998 --> 46:34.115
What's his name? Freddy Burns?

46:47.680 --> 46:49.320
"Don't call."

46:49.348 --> 46:52.261
Who the fuck do you think
you're talkin' to, motherfucker?

46:52.560 --> 46:53.846
Huh?

46:53.936 --> 46:56.269
Hello? Hello?

47:02.820 --> 47:04.061
What do you want?

47:05.156 --> 47:06.692
My name is Amelia Reardon.

47:06.782 --> 47:08.739
I taught Will English.

47:11.120 --> 47:15.114
I picked up...
The children had things.

47:16.751 --> 47:18.913
Projects in the art room, other stuff.

47:19.003 --> 47:21.416
- I said I'd bring it by.
- Right.

47:23.007 --> 47:24.168
I forgot.

47:26.260 --> 47:27.260
Sorry.

47:28.637 --> 47:30.754
Thank you.

47:56.082 --> 47:58.916
I know we don't know each other.

48:01.170 --> 48:04.459
I can't possibly imagine
what you're going through.

48:06.258 --> 48:10.548
But if you ever need anything,
please reach out to me.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.848
Can I tell you something?

48:15.810 --> 48:17.517
Amelia?

48:17.978 --> 48:19.219
'Course.

48:21.399 --> 48:23.766
I have got the soul of a whore.

48:32.451 --> 48:37.071
Lot of times
we do things to hurt ourselves

48:37.164 --> 48:39.656
because we think
we deserve to be hurt.

48:43.879 --> 48:46.917
Whatever you think
you did or didn't do,

48:48.801 --> 48:51.384
you don't deserve to suffer.

48:52.555 --> 48:54.547
You don't need to be punished.

48:56.600 --> 49:00.059
And those children wouldn't want you
doing that to yourself.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.472
I never knew my momma.

49:06.861 --> 49:09.148
All I hoped,

49:09.238 --> 49:11.571
when I knew enough to hope,
was that them kids

49:11.657 --> 49:13.990
might have a better time of it
than I did.

49:15.661 --> 49:18.278
But even then,
I couldn't make that easy on 'em.

49:21.417 --> 49:24.080
This wasn't a very happy home.

49:27.047 --> 49:29.004
Children should laugh.

49:31.385 --> 49:32.385
Right?

49:34.972 --> 49:37.430
There wasn't a lot of laughter
around here.

49:40.352 --> 49:43.140
Every parent wants to do more.

49:45.191 --> 49:47.148
But people make mistakes.

49:47.234 --> 49:48.975
Not like this.

49:50.196 --> 49:52.062
Not like I did.

49:54.283 --> 49:56.445
What do you mean?

49:58.496 --> 50:00.453
I ran around on Tom.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.699
I always run around.

50:06.212 --> 50:08.579
And sometimes, in this house,

50:08.672 --> 50:12.006
I know that
I have the soul of a whore,

50:12.092 --> 50:17.338
sometimes I couldn't breathe
in this house.

50:19.350 --> 50:21.933
And I didn't even argue
with that part of me.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.511
Well, what kind of woman
hates the only things

50:24.605 --> 50:26.597
that ever showed her love?

50:32.696 --> 50:35.985
I got a.38 revolver in my purse.

50:37.368 --> 50:39.360
It's just that last bit of courage...

50:39.453 --> 50:41.661
Where does that courage come from?

50:45.834 --> 50:49.919
I've never really thought of that
as courage, Mrs. Purcell.

51:08.274 --> 51:11.858
I have done such terrible things.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.937
Oh, good God.

51:19.994 --> 51:21.701
Oh, God.

51:24.748 --> 51:27.081
God, forgive me.

51:39.305 --> 51:42.013
The policeman who's looking for Julie,

51:42.099 --> 51:44.842
the black man, I know him a little.

51:45.603 --> 51:48.016
You can trust him. He's a good man.

51:48.105 --> 51:51.974
If there's anything
that you haven't said or shared,

51:52.943 --> 51:55.686
you feel you might need to,
I'm just saying

51:55.779 --> 52:00.865
you can trust Detective Hays,
and you should talk to him.

52:01.243 --> 52:05.453
Should talk to him about what?

52:05.539 --> 52:07.451
What's that supposed to mean?

52:07.541 --> 52:11.080
Nothing, I'm just saying
I think he's a good man,

52:11.170 --> 52:13.253
and I think you could talk to him.

52:15.466 --> 52:16.582
Yeah.

52:16.675 --> 52:19.884
Of course. Of course.

52:20.304 --> 52:24.719
I open up to you,
and you're tryin' to work me.

52:24.808 --> 52:27.050
Spillin' my guts.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.680
Who are you takin' this to, huh?

52:29.229 --> 52:31.391
Pretendin' you're listenin'.

52:31.482 --> 52:34.646
Get a load of the white trash whore
you're tryin' to work

52:34.735 --> 52:37.773
to get good with your cop boyfriend.

52:37.863 --> 52:39.445
I didn't mean anything. I'm sorry.

52:39.531 --> 52:42.945
You got a lot of nerve,
you know, coming around here,

52:43.035 --> 52:45.869
bringing me this shit!

52:45.954 --> 52:47.820
You pickaninny bitch!
You get out of here!

52:47.915 --> 52:48.915
I didn't mean anything...

52:48.999 --> 52:51.867
You snooty cunt!
You get the fuck out of my house!

52:52.586 --> 52:53.747
You get out!

53:09.561 --> 53:11.143
Hi, there.

53:13.482 --> 53:15.960
You think when you're finished,
you could leave the cans for me?

53:15.984 --> 53:18.943
Why? How much you get for 'em?

53:19.029 --> 53:20.736
Two cents apiece.

53:20.823 --> 53:22.655
We ought to get a part of that.

53:24.618 --> 53:27.361
I can deliver you a penny
next time we meet.

53:28.831 --> 53:30.663
That's fair, I guess.

53:30.749 --> 53:32.615
I'm almost done.

53:35.713 --> 53:37.955
Motherfucker!

53:46.974 --> 53:48.660
We got the drug
store surveillance

53:48.684 --> 53:51.017
going back seven days
before the robbery.

53:51.395 --> 53:54.559
Haven't been able to
go through it all.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.514
Pair of lawyers tryin' to see this?

53:56.608 --> 53:58.144
They subpoenaed us,

53:58.235 --> 54:00.568
but we're not in any hurry
to help 'em out.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.816
So far, we haven't
shared much, really.

54:03.407 --> 54:06.195
How 'bout a lady writer,
pretty good-lookin'?

54:07.661 --> 54:08.993
Share much with her?

54:09.079 --> 54:10.365
Right.

54:10.456 --> 54:11.788
Pretty black gal.

54:12.374 --> 54:14.491
Said her ex-husband was police.

54:18.213 --> 54:20.125
I'll leave you to it.

54:24.511 --> 54:26.673
Her prints were on
aisles five and seven.

54:38.233 --> 54:41.146
It's been five hours, and you're not
through a whole day yet.

54:41.236 --> 54:43.068
You gonna watch all this video
at once?

54:44.156 --> 54:45.363
I don't know.

54:51.121 --> 54:52.407
<i>'90.</i>

54:55.417 --> 54:57.625
'90, I found the video footage.

54:57.711 --> 54:59.873
We...

55:00.714 --> 55:02.250
We learned about Julie Purcell.

55:02.341 --> 55:04.082
That group of street kids,

55:04.176 --> 55:06.213
was that...

55:06.303 --> 55:07.669
Shut up.

55:09.139 --> 55:10.380
Shut up.

55:13.352 --> 55:14.968
Was that when I...

55:17.064 --> 55:18.064
Yes.

55:20.776 --> 55:22.859
That's when
I lost you at the Walmart.

55:22.945 --> 55:25.062
'90.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.693
The fuckin' Walmart.

55:27.783 --> 55:30.867
I don't think
I ever did forgive myself,

55:30.953 --> 55:32.865
losin' track of you like that,

55:32.955 --> 55:35.993
the way I yelled,

55:36.083 --> 55:38.416
and how sad
that made you and your brother.

55:42.172 --> 55:44.710
Did we ever find the brown car?

55:44.967 --> 55:46.174
Whose was it?

55:48.971 --> 55:50.212
I felt...

55:52.349 --> 55:57.435
I felt, sometimes without knowing it,
I felt like maybe I...

56:01.775 --> 56:04.267
Like I made y'all sick.

56:04.361 --> 56:05.602
Like I...

56:07.823 --> 56:09.530
Like I poisoned you.

56:10.868 --> 56:13.611
I don't know, may have.

56:21.461 --> 56:24.875
I may be decidin' I don't want
to stay alive without your mother.

56:24.965 --> 56:25.965
Shut up!

56:27.009 --> 56:29.626
You're nothin'! Shut up!

56:36.310 --> 56:39.724
I need to tell Roland about O'Brien.

56:39.813 --> 56:41.145
Where's Roland?

56:43.025 --> 56:47.440
When did we last talk to Roland?

56:57.664 --> 56:58.905
I'm sorry.

57:24.775 --> 57:27.563
Looks like a late-model
Lincoln or Mercury.

57:27.653 --> 57:29.610
Maybe a Chevy.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.988
Do they still make Mercury? Hmm?

57:39.790 --> 57:42.373
Sedan. Dark color.

57:43.543 --> 57:45.284
Deep gray under the moon.

57:52.302 --> 57:54.589
See him again,

57:54.680 --> 57:56.797
may mean somebody's watchin' you.

57:56.890 --> 57:58.222
Uh-huh.

58:28.130 --> 58:29.621
Have a seat, pal.

58:45.522 --> 58:48.435
I know we a few weeks late here,

58:48.525 --> 58:51.063
but I want to wish you
a happy 18th birthday.

58:51.153 --> 58:53.611
All the fellows pitched in
and got you life imprisonment

58:53.697 --> 58:56.610
and a good possibility
of chokin' in the gas chamber,

58:56.700 --> 58:58.111
you fuckin' shit-heeled twerp.

58:58.618 --> 59:00.405
- Wait, wait, wait.
- So, Freddy.

59:00.912 --> 59:03.074
How polite we talked to you
the first time,

59:03.165 --> 59:06.408
that was all behind the small
possibility you might be innocent.

59:06.501 --> 59:10.620
But now, that small possibility's
gone down the toilet.

59:18.346 --> 59:20.884
Your prints.

59:20.974 --> 59:22.715
I didn't do it.

59:24.352 --> 59:26.639
I did not do it, I swear to God.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.892
In other words, you're sleepin',

59:28.982 --> 59:30.974
somebody secretly
removes your fingerprints

59:31.068 --> 59:32.900
and puts 'em on Will Purcell's bike.

59:32.986 --> 59:34.727
No, I'm not saying
I wasn't ever on it.

59:34.821 --> 59:37.234
I took his bike, all right?
He was a nerd, okay?

59:37.324 --> 59:39.135
He was coming around
when we were hanging out, and...

59:39.159 --> 59:41.902
- His sister with him?
- No.

59:42.245 --> 59:44.223
He was looking for her.
I don't know, he was bugging us.

59:44.247 --> 59:45.863
And you what?

59:46.666 --> 59:49.909
And I'd had a few.
I feel terrible about this.

59:50.003 --> 59:52.541
I might have shoved him,
chased him off,

59:52.631 --> 59:53.963
and played around on his bike.

59:54.049 --> 59:56.006
Where'd he go, you chased him off?

59:56.635 --> 59:58.501
He ran.

59:58.595 --> 59:59.927
Into the woods.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.720
We already know all that.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:04.140
You haven't mentioned that
you were gone for a half hour

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:06.263
before your friends saw you again.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.557
Just an observation,

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:10.388
I don't think you're well-liked.

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:13.441
What'd you do in the woods,
those 30 minutes?

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:15.796
Look, I don't know
what happened to him.

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:18.279
I chased him just for a minute,
but I was kind of drunk.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.510
I lost my way real fast.
Like, 'fore I knew it,

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.594
there was just trees all around,

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:22.929
and it took a while
to find my way out.

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.239
What about the bike?

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:26.070
It was where he dropped it.

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:27.767
I fooled around on it, that's all.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:30.158
I hit a tree, I bent the wheel,
and just...

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:32.539
You know,
I threw it back in the marsh.

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.545
And you're gonna risk
20 years in prison

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.372
saying the only thing you did

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:39.379
was throwing the kid off
and take his bike?

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.836
Which, by the way,
makes you a dirtbag.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:44.889
Puttin' you
in the legal category "screwed."

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.511
Prior to suckin' gas.

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:47.954
Call him a shit-heeled twerp again.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.765
You shit-heeled twerp.

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.598
Unless you can enlist us in
the Save Freddy Burns campaign,

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:54.774
which can only achieve victory

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:58.945
with your complete disclosure
of the truth in its entirety.

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.316
What?

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:02.569
He's sayin' tell the whole story

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.867
or train your ass to be an entrance.

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:07.991
I know brothers inside
will tear your guts up

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:09.663
fuckin' you stupid.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:14.637
Goddamn.

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:22.773
<i>Fuck.</i>

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:36.616
That prison rape's
a real go-to for you lately, huh?

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.575
Somethin' you want to tell me?

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.422
I think he's done.

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:49.796
<i>No, no, no.</i>

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.503
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:54.805
Never mind.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.008
You gonna go with this?

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:58.684
Are we sayin' it's him?

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:02.304
What are you thinkin'?

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:06.439
That probably when he's 25,
that kid's gonna be in jail.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.440
But not for this.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:11.509
Detectives, a couple
of calls just came in.

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:13.946
Something big's going down
at that trash guy's place.

01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:15.276
West Finger.

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:16.577
Men with guns, they said.

01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:18.745
Keep him here.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:21.824
Woodard!

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:24.831
You was warned off them kids!

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:28.206
Woodard!

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.637
Woodard! Get out here!

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:43.308
Woodard!

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:45.890
We comin' in if you ain't comin' out!

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:48.146
What's goin' on here?

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:49.981
Back up!
