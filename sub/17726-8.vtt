I love him.
I know he loves me.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.181

- But I want to go.

- We have to do it.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.554

- It's not about Lala!

00:20.588 --> 00:21.955
It's not about her.

- You cannot accept
that you f---ed up.

- Oh, my God.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.628
I'm supposed to fly across
the country with you in a week?

00:27.661 --> 00:28.929
How the f---
am I supposed to do that?

00:28.962 --> 00:31.465

our best friend.

Me and Grandma talk about this

01:07.568 --> 01:09.002
We immediately
fell in love with you.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.138

01:10.171 --> 01:11.305
- No, and I'm not
just saying that.

- Aww.
- This is good.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.343
This is really good.
- Yeah.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.644
- I mean,
how much for all these?

01:16.677 --> 01:18.346
- Did you stay on your budget?
- I wanted to--

01:18.379 --> 01:20.214
I wanted to keep it,
you know, under, like, 15.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.649
- Did you?
- That wasn't realistic.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.617
- Until we found out,
like, our final count and stuff,

01:23.651 --> 01:24.752
that's gonna obviously, like,

01:24.785 --> 01:26.654
change the old,
you know, number.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.590
I was born and raised
in Park City, Utah,

01:29.623 --> 01:32.960
and four years ago,
my parents separated,

01:32.993 --> 01:35.429
and so my mother
moved to Las Vegas

01:35.463 --> 01:36.830
to be with my grandma.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.267
Because I have to hand-stuff
all these invitations,

01:39.300 --> 01:40.834

to help with that.

Here we go.

- So here's--Take that.
- Here's my pile.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.740

that for my wedding invitation,

01:46.774 --> 01:49.643
I wanted it to be something
that was a keepsake,

01:49.677 --> 01:52.846
so I came across
this tea towel idea,

01:52.880 --> 01:55.683
to have the wedding invitation
printed on the towel,

01:55.716 --> 01:57.485
and I thought it was beautiful.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.820

02:03.524 --> 02:04.692
it was gonna be
a towel like this.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.260
- No, a tea towel.

02:06.294 --> 02:09.463
- It's $18.50.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.666
That is so much money for a rag.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.834

I got to get out of here.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.369
You did an amazing job.
- Where are you going?

02:15.403 --> 02:17.205
- I got to go get
my suit consultation.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.072

A totally separate source.

like, seven separate sources

03:06.420 --> 03:07.455

about the Range Rover.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.996
- Lala's telling the truth,
and everyone is lying.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.999
- My son had one.
It was $750 a month to lease it.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.635
- Katie. $750 a month.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.604

- What?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.973
So who's paying
the $750 a month?

Like, nautical themed.

Don't react.

Don't encourage.

in jail.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.780
express all their feelings,
but you can't.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.682

and I'll forgive them.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.561
You shouldn't be mad at this.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.995
Oh, you should
be upset with this.

you have to do is,

Nothing.
Don't respond.

- Huh?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.268

and then feel bad.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.538

- What's up?

07:59.847 --> 08:01.849
How are you, my friend?
- Oh, yeah. How you feeling?

08:01.882 --> 08:03.383
- Thanks for coming, guys.
A lot better.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.052
Yeah, it's a pretty big
deal for me.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.788
It's like the first f---ing gig
away from Pump and Sur.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.089
I'm on Sunset Boulevard,

08:09.122 --> 08:11.625
in between the Whisky a Go Go
and the famous Roxy.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.594
I love DJ'ing,
that's my passion,

08:13.627 --> 08:15.328
and if I can't do it
at Sur and Pump,

08:15.362 --> 08:16.363
then I'm gonna go do it

08:16.396 --> 08:17.731
at the next place
that'll hire me

08:17.765 --> 08:19.567
and show Lisa
that I can be the best.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.568
So things are looking up.
- Cool.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.635
- I just got to stay focused,
you know?

08:21.669 --> 08:22.736
All right.
Let me mix, guys.

08:22.770 --> 08:23.871
- Cool.
- All right. Do your thing, man.

08:23.904 --> 08:24.938
I'll talk to you
in a little bit.

08:24.972 --> 08:25.939
- Do your thing.
We'll get a drink.

We'll see you in a minute.

08:31.779 --> 08:36.183

than Sur and Pump put together.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.284
- Oh!

08:37.317 --> 08:40.153
- Yeah, I'm a feisty
mother----er tonight.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.955
I always worry about my friends

08:41.989 --> 08:44.224
getting too comfortable
in certain positions,

08:44.257 --> 08:47.595
so I look at it
as him getting fired from Sur

08:47.595 --> 08:49.963
was almost like a blessing.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.933
He's now working
at a different bar.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.735
He's booking other DJ gigs.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.203
I'm extremely proud of him.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.771
This is the only thing
I've had tonight.

I've had.

- Oh. Good for you.
- Haven't even finished it.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.647
I've been sober
for, like, a while now.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.116
Been drinking.
- Sober for, what...

09:09.149 --> 09:11.151
I mean, who's counting,
but nine days.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.823
- Oh, so you're just sipping
sizzurp now?

09:15.856 --> 09:18.191
You're not sober.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.194
- I take, like, one sip
every, like, hour.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.295
It coats my throat.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.997
- Just because James isn't

09:24.031 --> 09:25.933
throwing back
shots of tequila,

09:25.966 --> 09:28.035
it doesn't mean he's sober.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.904
I mean, if you're chugging
the poor man's sizzurp,

09:30.938 --> 09:32.640
you're still getting f---ed up.

to her birthday party,

09:44.451 --> 09:46.286
which is different
from last year,

09:46.319 --> 09:48.021
when I didn't get an invite.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.890
- How was the birthday?
Did you all have fun?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.258
- Oh, my gosh.
It was amazing.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.293
- You have fun?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.863
- I wasn't invited.
- Ooh.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.097
- It sounds awesome.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.799
I mean,
we're going to wine country,

09:58.832 --> 10:00.400
and everybody loves wine...

10:00.433 --> 10:01.702
and NASCAR,

10:01.735 --> 10:04.337
where everybody's just proud
to be an American.

on the final list?

10:07.808 --> 10:09.710

- Schwartz.
Jax and Brittany.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.279
- Okay.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.513
I know that Jax was saying,

10:13.546 --> 10:15.683
"You know,
I just don't like Lala.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.117
She's a f---ing liar."

10:17.150 --> 10:18.652
Jax is a f---ing asshole.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.487
But f--- it.
Ariana's my girl.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.755
She invited me on this trip,

10:21.789 --> 10:23.691
so I'm gonna suck it up,
and I'm gonna go.

there's no conversation,

that Ja--like, we don't
speak one word to each other,

10:28.595 --> 10:30.230

I want to go and have
a good time on your birthday.

that's what it's about.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.370
- Yeah.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.505
- Coming up...

10:38.538 --> 10:40.941
Stassi, in my opinion,
always makes things worse.

- No more.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.647
- These cysts are--are caused

11:20.748 --> 11:22.750
from taking
a lot of supplements

11:22.750 --> 11:25.252
and screwing up
my testosterone/estrogen level.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.620
So it was my fault.
It was my doing.

on your chest?

- So I can't punch you.
- Hurts anytime I have a drink.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.780
Alcohol produces estrogen,
so it hurts my chest.

stop drinking?

on their summer bodies.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.729
- I mean, you can't
take those things back.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.399

like, in New York or something,

14:11.484 --> 14:13.686
I think Scheana
is very image-conscious.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.990
I think that she just
doesn't like to be judged,

14:17.024 --> 14:20.827

almost anything to get approval.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.589
or a new pair of sunglasses,

15:22.622 --> 15:25.258
but Lisa gets a summer car.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.694
This is the first
official invitation

15:27.727 --> 15:29.562
I'm giving someone.
- Okay, let me look at this.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.431
- Yeah.
- Okay, you go down there.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.633
I mean, that looks quite
kind of bohemian, really.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.868
- Yep.
[laughs]

15:35.902 --> 15:37.337
- Wow.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.905
[soft dramatic music]

15:39.006 --> 15:40.873
This is so unconventional.

15:40.907 --> 15:44.011
It's different.
It's unique.

15:44.011 --> 15:47.114
Maybe not quite
what I would have chosen.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.249
Oh, oh.
- Oh, hold on.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.218
- I love that.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.685
Do you love it, though?
- I love it.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.854
Look at them.
- That is so cute.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.389
That makes me feel
so much better.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.058
But it's--it's...

15:58.091 --> 16:00.160
unique, and I like that.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.694
- There is some drama
with the girls,

16:01.728 --> 16:03.330
with my bridesmaids, of course.
- Ugh.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.032
- No, it's just with Scheana.
It's just--it's just hard.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.866
- With Scheana?
- We've really tried with her

16:06.899 --> 16:10.403
to make her feel that, like,
this is not four years ago

16:10.437 --> 16:13.406
for--with me, when you want
to make it about my happiness

16:13.440 --> 16:14.574
and I'm so unhappy.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.443
- Katie, in the last six months,

16:16.476 --> 16:18.911
you've gotten angry
like Tequila Katie again.

16:18.945 --> 16:22.049
- See, I got the impression
that you had a couple of drinks

16:22.049 --> 16:24.717
and sent her a long
kind of aggressive text.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.853
- But this is--
- I know Scheana loves you.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.155
- And I love Scheana as well.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.489
- You were getting on
so well with her,

16:29.522 --> 16:31.291
and suddenly Stassi
comes back in the picture,

16:31.324 --> 16:32.959
and suddenly there's--
- It's not Stassi.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.394
It's not--it's not Stassi.
- [sighs]

16:34.427 --> 16:37.264
All the roads always lead

16:37.297 --> 16:38.598
to Miss Schroeder.

16:38.631 --> 16:39.732
Trust me.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.168
Stassi, in my opinion,

16:41.201 --> 16:42.935
always makes things worse,
not better.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.272
- She's trying--
No, she's actually trying.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.508
- I wouldn't--I'm betting she's
trying to wind you up as well.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.078
- These are my thoughts
and my feelings and my opinions.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.345
Mine, and I--if some--

16:52.379 --> 16:53.880
- Is it Katie?
- Yes, it is.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.415
- Because you have
been guilty of--

16:55.448 --> 16:57.084
- That's--okay,
that's insulting.

16:57.084 --> 17:00.120
I can think for myself.
- [exhales]

17:00.153 --> 17:03.190
[electronic music]

17:03.223 --> 17:08.428
*

17:08.461 --> 17:10.097
- Hi, good morning.
- Hi.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.864
- How are you?
- You were my nurse too.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.533
- I know
- I remember.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.001
- Okay, just bring that back up
when you're done.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.002
- Okay.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.104
I want to make this very clear

17:17.104 --> 17:19.106
that this is not
a breast reduction.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.207
A lot of men have this,

17:20.240 --> 17:22.175
especially
a lot of bodybuilders.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.610
When they're
taking supplements,

17:23.643 --> 17:25.645
some of the supplements
counteract with their body

17:25.678 --> 17:27.680
and it causes gynecomastia.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.981
I feel like we're here
every day.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.750
- I know.
- We had--we had my nose job.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.886
Is this real life?
- [laughs]

17:33.920 --> 17:35.488
- We had your boob job.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.158
- Oh, this is so nerve-racking.
- Just relax.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.326
Before you know it,
we'll be done.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.493
- All right.
- Okay.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.129
- Then I had to redo
my nose job

17:42.129 --> 17:43.363
'cause I walked into a wall.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.165
Run like this...
boom,

17:45.198 --> 17:47.367
and so I got a good ten stitches
in my forehead.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.536
- [laughs]
- Are you nervous?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.538
- Yeah, I am, actually.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.005
I think this is the one
I'm most nervous about

17:53.039 --> 17:54.441
out of all of 'em,
believe it or not.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.808
- I'll be there
to take care of you.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.410
Everything'll be fine.
Don't be worried.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.811
They know what they're doing.
- I feel like I can get

17:58.845 --> 18:00.347
one of those punch cards,
you know?

18:00.380 --> 18:01.581
- [laughs]
- Five surgeries,

18:01.614 --> 18:03.583
get the sixth one free.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.917
Hey.
- Good morning.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.453
- Hey.
[chuckles]

18:06.486 --> 18:07.887
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.789
- Good to see you.
- Hey, good to see you again.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.158
- How are you doing?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.459
- It's getting to the point
where it's--

18:12.492 --> 18:13.826
it's starting to bother me,
so I got to get this out.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.162
- Perfect.
Listen.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.429
We'll take care of it today.
- I'm nervous.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.830
Want to get this out.
Get this done.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.866
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah, you're gonna be fine.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.201
Come on, let's head back.
- All right.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.835
I am very nervous
for the surgery, you know?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.304
They're cutting
right over my heart.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.905
Hopefully this time,
we'll get it all

18:25.938 --> 18:27.374
and I won't have
to go through this again.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.576
- Here's your bed.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.244
8:00 on the dot.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.779
[dramatic music]

18:32.812 --> 18:35.715
And scoot up just
a little bit further.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.184
*

18:37.184 --> 18:39.051
- It--it'll be done
before you even know it.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.354
For you, it'll seem like
five minutes.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.522
- Arms at 90.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.192
- Okay, let's do this.
- Okay.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.094
- I'll make an incision.
both: 8:17.

18:48.195 --> 18:51.030
- He's got this hard disk
of breast tissue,

18:51.063 --> 18:52.365
so we're gonna try
to take this out

18:52.399 --> 18:54.367
as one complete disk.

18:54.401 --> 18:57.103
All right, here it is.

18:57.204 --> 19:00.039
We'll send it to the pathologist
to ensure it's not anything.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.842
It's a pretty sizable amount
here.

19:02.875 --> 19:03.910
- Coming up...

19:03.943 --> 19:05.812
You're going to Sonoma?
- Yes.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.414
- You see?
It's things like that.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.048
People are going
to ask questions.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.751
- Well, I don't like questions,
but I like people being jealous.

19:16.956 --> 19:17.324
[upbeat music]

19:19.926 --> 19:23.530
*

19:23.563 --> 19:25.965
- Jax, you're all done
with surgery.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.335
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.870
- Hi, baby.
- On the other side.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.005
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.708
- Oh, you feel okay?

19:35.742 --> 19:37.410
[monitor beeping]

19:37.444 --> 19:40.647
Yeah.
- You did great, man.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.282
We got everything out,

19:42.315 --> 19:44.784
sent it off to the pathologist
just to make sure.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.118
I think you're gonna be happy.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.555
So as far as
post-op instructions,

19:48.588 --> 19:50.257
you know, while he's
on pain medicine,

19:50.290 --> 19:52.859
especially for the next
couple days to a week,

19:52.892 --> 19:55.328
uh, let's avoid alcohol.
- Yeah.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.163
- Oh, here we go again
with the no drinking.

19:57.264 --> 20:00.132
How do you go to wine country
and not have a glass of wine?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.968
I mean, how do you go
to a NASCAR race

20:02.001 --> 20:04.103
and not funnel a beer?

20:04.136 --> 20:05.338
- Otherwise,
he's gonna do great.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.973
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.175
- Have a good day.
- You too.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.279
- I think now we're just gonna
get you home.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.914
I texted your mom, okay?

20:14.947 --> 20:17.284
[soft dramatic music]

20:17.317 --> 20:19.686
[laughing]
You're gonna touch my boob?

20:21.588 --> 20:24.324
- As long as it helps.
[laughs]

20:24.357 --> 20:27.327
[stylized music]

20:27.360 --> 20:33.800
*

20:33.833 --> 20:35.802
- Hey, Lala.
- Hi, Lisa, how are you?

20:35.835 --> 20:37.169
- Oh, my God,
look at those nails.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.938
- They're my fighting claws.
- Oh, right.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.673
Well, hopefully there won't
be any fighting around here.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.008
- Yes, I haven't needed
to use them.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.209
- Okay, good.
- Yes.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.777
You look very pretty.
- Thank you.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.212
Have you got stilts on
or something?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.447
- I do.
- Okay.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.648
And you're gonna be able
to work in those?

20:48.681 --> 20:50.049
Oh, they've got red bottoms
as well.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.217
- Yeah.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.785
- You see?
It's things like that.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.421
People are going
to ask questions.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.123
- Well, I don't like questions,
but I like people being jealous.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.525
- Okay, all right, well.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.960
The red sole is like
a red flag to me.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.930
It is Christian Louboutin,
500 bucks--

21:03.963 --> 21:05.832
not for a pair,
for one.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.134
Either this girl
is spending all her money

21:08.167 --> 21:10.403
on shoes and HermÃ¨s bracelets

21:10.437 --> 21:12.004
and not paying her rent,

21:12.038 --> 21:14.341
or there's something else
going on.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.376
You're working...

21:16.409 --> 21:17.744
this weekend?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.145
- I got my shift covered.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.547
'Cause, you know,
it's Ariana's birthday,

21:20.580 --> 21:22.582
so a few of us
are going to Sonoma.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.451
- You're going to Sonoma?
- Yes.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.685
- Okay.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.520
Well, that should be fun, right?
- Yeah.

21:27.554 --> 21:30.623
I mean, I'm just trying
to slowly work my way in

21:30.657 --> 21:34.361
and show that I'm not that bad,
but we're in very tight corners.

21:34.361 --> 21:37.697
Ariana has told me that we are
going to be staying in a cabin

21:37.730 --> 21:39.432
with one bathroom

21:39.466 --> 21:41.734
that I'll be sharing
with Jax...

21:41.768 --> 21:43.903
- Jax, what the f---
are you doing, dude?

21:43.936 --> 21:45.638
- I'm sorry.
- Tom...

21:45.672 --> 21:48.107
- Jax, don't run away
from your feelings.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.108
- Schwartz...

21:49.141 --> 21:52.379
- F---. Oh, my God.
- Okay.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.847
- I...

21:54.881 --> 21:57.384
- You created your bed,
so you're gonna lie in it.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.285
You like to create
a little problem,

21:59.386 --> 22:00.453
so you've got to deal with it.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.088
- I know.
That's the problem.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.123
- I have a certain amount
of sympathy for Lala,

22:04.156 --> 22:06.058
but she's definitely
provocative.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.794
She likes to create a situation

22:07.827 --> 22:09.396
and then she likes to be
the baby girl.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.597
Life doesn't work like that.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.898
Kill everybody with kindness.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.233
I wouldn't take your top off
at the NASCAR race

22:14.266 --> 22:16.035
if I were you.
- Got it.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.737
- But anyway, I have to go.
Enough of your nonsense.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.238
- Okay, thanks
for listening to me.

22:19.271 --> 22:20.840
- So you have a good time.
- Thank you.

22:20.873 --> 22:26.846
*

22:26.879 --> 22:29.649
- You look so good, babe.
- Thanks, babe.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.183
- Here.

22:31.217 --> 22:32.852
*

22:32.885 --> 22:34.721
- Thank you.
- Yeah, this is nice, eh?

22:34.754 --> 22:36.055
Hi.
- Hi, James, how are you doing?

22:36.088 --> 22:37.289
- How are you?
Pretty good.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.291
How about yourself?
- Welcome. Very well.

22:39.325 --> 22:41.160
Would you like
a refreshment?

22:41.193 --> 22:43.463
- Uh, I'm fine with water
right now, actually.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.231
- Me too.
- Shall I order a couple things

22:45.264 --> 22:46.433
and we'll split it?
- Yeah.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.034
- Raquel and I have
so much in common.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.236
We're gonna do
the rock shrimp, please.

22:50.269 --> 22:52.338
Um, we like to...

22:54.774 --> 22:56.008
Eat food.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.979
- I'm competing for Miss Malibu
in a few months.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.714
- Oh, my God,
that's already coming up?

23:01.748 --> 23:03.616
- Yeah, it's coming up fast,
so...

23:03.650 --> 23:05.652
- Wow.
- I have to start training

23:05.685 --> 23:07.286
and practicing walking.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.355
- Are you nervous?
- Not yet.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.557
I mean, it's so hard to walk

23:10.590 --> 23:13.325
in six-inch heels
and a bathing suit...

23:13.359 --> 23:14.694
- Okay.
- Onstage in front

23:14.727 --> 23:17.930
of so many people,
you know?

23:17.964 --> 23:19.466
- How do you walk?
How do you do that?

23:19.466 --> 23:21.300
Like, isn't it just walking?
- Well, for bathing suit,

23:21.333 --> 23:24.471
it's more of like a--
a peppier--

23:24.504 --> 23:26.973
Like, think Victoria's Secret
walk, you know?

23:27.006 --> 23:29.709
- You know, living in LA
when you're beautiful and young,

23:29.742 --> 23:31.778
you know,
there's really no excuse.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.312
If you're gonna have
a girlfriend,

23:33.345 --> 23:35.214
you know,
she's gonna have to be hot.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.283
Can I kiss you?
- Yeah.

23:37.316 --> 23:40.319
- [grunts]
- Of course, always.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.254
I love you.
- Love you.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.490
It's funny;
no matter, like,

23:43.490 --> 23:45.992
how many DJ gigs I get,
you know,

23:46.025 --> 23:48.260
they're all, like,
around these clubs

23:48.294 --> 23:50.730
and venues and lounges
around LA,

23:50.763 --> 23:52.599
and it's like,
I've been working for Lisa

23:52.632 --> 23:54.634
for three years,
and it's just been taken away.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.837
I took it away from myself,
and it f---ing breaks my heart.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.371
That's my fam.
It's, like, my family.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.507
- Yeah.
- It's been basically

24:00.540 --> 24:01.708
kind of hard for me
to realize

24:01.741 --> 24:03.776
what the next step is
in my music.

24:03.810 --> 24:07.079
- Did you get your job back
at Pump?

24:07.113 --> 24:09.181
- Not yet.
Not yet.

24:09.215 --> 24:10.950
You know, I think I'm gonna
see her tomorrow.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.152
I'm gonna come
with a more mature presence...

24:13.185 --> 24:14.554
- Yeah.
- And really explain to her,

24:14.587 --> 24:15.722
"Listen.

24:15.755 --> 24:19.526
"What can I do
to maybe get my job back?"

24:19.526 --> 24:21.528
At the end of the day,
I'm happier at Pump.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.962
I'm happier at Sur.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.531
- Oh, yeah, I can tell.

24:24.531 --> 24:27.534
You've been upset
the past few days.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.301
- Between, like,
my parents going through

24:29.335 --> 24:32.304
all the drama this year
and me getting fired from Sur,

24:32.338 --> 24:33.840
it's a lot to handle
at once for me.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.908
It's like my other mom is,
like, telling me

24:35.942 --> 24:37.577
that I'm not working for her
anymore.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.745
And I won't stop.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.313
I-I-I really don't know
if I could stop.

24:41.347 --> 24:44.250
- What else could you do?
- If she says no tomorrow,

24:44.283 --> 24:46.318
then I'll--you know
I'll be asking next month

24:46.352 --> 24:48.454
or the month after that.
- Oh, yeah.

24:48.555 --> 24:51.991
[electronic music]

24:52.024 --> 24:54.160
- Kingsley.
- Hi.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.695
- Hi.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.297
- [giggling]
- [exhales deeply]

24:59.298 --> 25:01.400
- Oh.
- [sighs]

25:01.568 --> 25:03.603
- My hurt boys.
- I need to sit down.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.237
- Just lay over here
on the couch

25:05.271 --> 25:07.740
and I'll get some pillows
behind you.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.075
How about that?

25:09.108 --> 25:11.811
Jax does not deal
with pain well whatsoever.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.012
If he cuts his hand,

25:13.045 --> 25:14.280
it's like the worst thing
in the world.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.115
Babe, are you hungry?
- I want to see it so bad.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.316
I want to see
what it looks like.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.818
- It's not gonna look right
for a while.

25:18.851 --> 25:23.590
He said that first it's gonna
be, like, concaved in...

25:23.623 --> 25:26.192
- What?
- Until the swelling goes down,

25:26.225 --> 25:27.594
and then it--
- Concave?

25:27.594 --> 25:29.128
- Yeah.
I got all your medicines here.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.597
- [groans]

25:30.597 --> 25:32.965
- You want a sandwich
and some soup?

25:32.999 --> 25:34.133
- Uh...
[exhales]

25:34.166 --> 25:35.401
I'll do a bowl of soup.

25:35.434 --> 25:38.605
- He's a little grumpy.
He's really needy.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.439
He's constantly asking me
for food.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.709
So pretty much,
he's exactly the same.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.811
[knock at door]
Who's here?

25:44.844 --> 25:46.112
- Hi, Kingsley.
- Watch out.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.247
Conehead's coming out.
- Hey, dude.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.316
all: Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

25:50.349 --> 25:51.751
- How you feeling?
You look pretty good

25:51.784 --> 25:52.752
compared to how
you usually look.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.120
- Yeah, dude.
- [laughs]

25:54.153 --> 25:55.855
- Dude, it's become routine
for us to comfort you

25:55.888 --> 25:58.090
after jail and after surgery.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.660
Whoa, doughnuts.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.261
[gasps]
Is that blood, dude?

26:02.294 --> 26:03.630
both: No, it's jelly.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.632
- It's a jelly doughnut.
- What?

26:05.665 --> 26:06.999
I'm like,
"Do I get a punch card?"

26:07.033 --> 26:08.167
Like, ser--
- Yeah.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.501
Hey, by the way,
they're gonna look great,

26:09.535 --> 26:11.403
and me and Tom thought
it would be nice to get you--

26:11.437 --> 26:12.705
- Dude.
- You can fill it out.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.173
You're finally gonna look good
in this, dude.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.441
- Yes.
- Yeah.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.143
- Not gonna have those droopy
man boobs anymore.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.511
- I know.
Did you say "droopy man boobs"?

26:19.545 --> 26:20.713
- He did.
- Oh, my gosh.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.650
- Why's it so small?
- This is hilarious.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.184
Oh, my gosh.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.853
- This is awesome.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.755
This is for Brittany.
- Oh, yeah, that's...

26:28.788 --> 26:30.990
- Oh, no.
- That's great.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.358
No, do not get Jax that.

26:32.391 --> 26:35.161
We got Jax the service bell
as kind of a joke...

26:35.194 --> 26:36.162
[bell dinging]

26:36.195 --> 26:37.163
But I feel like

26:37.196 --> 26:38.397
he's gonna utilize that thing,

26:38.430 --> 26:41.100
having Brittany wait on him
hand and feet.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.069
[all laugh]

26:43.102 --> 26:44.236
- There you go.
- What is this?

26:44.270 --> 26:46.038
- Ooh, look at that shirt.
It's nice.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.940
It's got the bra built in it.
- [laughing]

26:47.974 --> 26:49.842
- You can be in style
and be supported

26:49.876 --> 26:51.543
at the same time, you know?

26:51.577 --> 26:53.112
- You're one of the rare couples

26:53.145 --> 26:55.581
that have both had
breast augmentation.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.316
Male/female couples.
- Yeah.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.551
That's really cute.
- That's a rare combo, dude.

26:59.585 --> 27:00.987
- Hey, you guys ready
for Sonoma?

27:01.020 --> 27:03.055
- Are you gonna be able to--
- As of right now,

27:03.089 --> 27:04.590
I-I feel good.
I feel fine.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.292
I should be fine by Saturday.

27:06.325 --> 27:07.593
I mean, I'm obviously
not gonna be,

27:07.694 --> 27:09.796
like, going crazy,
but I'm gonna go.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.197
- You're definitely
gonna be going crazy.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.699
- Is Scheana still going
on the trip

27:12.732 --> 27:13.866
with the girls and everything?

27:13.900 --> 27:15.167
- I have no idea
what's going on.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.468
- Is Katie still livid
with her or no?

27:16.502 --> 27:18.170
- I've stayed clear of that one
for reasons--

27:18.204 --> 27:20.072
'Cause I'm trying
to keep Katie calm

27:20.106 --> 27:21.440
for the wedding,
you know?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.175
I don't want to get her
riled up.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.543
- Let's give her some tequila.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.178
- Well, she's good now
with that.

- Oh...
- Till she's not.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.417
[all chuckle]
Till she's not.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.719
- Coming up...

27:32.719 --> 27:35.154
- Stay out of what's
other people's business.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.588
It's not your business.
That's your problem.

27:36.622 --> 27:37.757
You get into
other people's business.

27:37.790 --> 27:38.925
- Don't tell me
that's my problem.

Hi.
- Hi.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.976
- Look at your haircut.
- Hi, Luda.

- Yeah.

- Wait.
I love this.

This is cute.

11-year-old brother.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.952
He's in fifth grade.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.755
He's actually the sibling
I'm most closest to.

be shy of girls.

Not like a wolf or snake.

You just have to listen
to that advice.

I'm gonna take it to heart.

I had to buy a fan.

he was just murdered

29:23.362 --> 29:25.331
because of the way
that he had to shut it off,

29:25.364 --> 29:26.966
which I'm okay with.
- She's pretty.

and go into my room.

29:48.855 --> 29:51.323
like, how many days
it's really gonna last

29:51.357 --> 29:53.392
because I know that
everybody makes fun of me now

29:53.425 --> 29:55.127
when I say that we broke up.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.063
- It's kind of normal
for you and Patrick.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.598
You know,
for the last two years...

29:59.631 --> 30:01.300
- I know.
- This has become a pattern.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.801
- If there's not,
like, a major move

30:02.835 --> 30:06.272
to, like, come and win me back
or something,

30:06.305 --> 30:09.976
like, I'm going to Montauk,
and if a dude comes up to me,

30:10.009 --> 30:11.210
I will entertain it.
- Yeah.

30:11.243 --> 30:12.611
- I'm not gonna be like, "Bye."

about Patrick and I

30:14.613 --> 30:16.282

but this time feels very serious
and very real.

in a fight with all of us.

[quietly]
Ouch.

30:36.035 --> 30:41.840
*

30:41.874 --> 30:44.110
Hi, how are you?
- Hi, how are you?

30:44.143 --> 30:46.412
- Um, can we get two,
uh, gel pedicures?

30:46.445 --> 30:48.547
And then, um, I just need
a polish change.

30:48.580 --> 30:49.648
- Sure.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.119
[upbeat music]

30:53.152 --> 30:55.687
- It's so hot.
- I know.

30:55.721 --> 30:58.457
- If it's 100 here,
it's, like, 110 at my house.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.059
- Yeah, but you have
air-conditioning.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.593
- I know, I do, yeah.
- I do not.

31:01.627 --> 31:04.063
Why there got to be
so many options?

31:04.096 --> 31:06.132
- I'm gonna do this one.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.299
You said that's a gel, right?

31:07.333 --> 31:08.467
- Yeah, gel.
- Okay.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.502
- I've never had gloves
like this.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.737
- I know. What's--
I don't understand.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.639
- I don't know.
- Like, very--okay.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.674
- Protect my hands?

31:15.707 --> 31:18.210
I'm tired.
- It's been a long couple days.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.578
*

31:19.611 --> 31:21.413
Have you talked
to Stassi or Katie

31:21.447 --> 31:22.781
in the last couple days?

31:22.814 --> 31:24.283
No?

31:24.316 --> 31:26.685
Not since the party?

31:26.718 --> 31:29.155
- I, like, woke up Saturday,
and I'm like...

31:29.188 --> 31:30.789
- Yeah.
- "Damn it.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.324
I wish that was just
a bad dream."

31:32.358 --> 31:33.625
- I know.
- And I could have woke up

31:33.659 --> 31:35.061
and been like,
"Oh, everything's fine."

31:35.094 --> 31:36.562
No.
- I was downstairs

31:36.595 --> 31:39.365
when Stassi came
running down crying

31:39.398 --> 31:40.967
and locked herself
in the bathroom.

31:40.967 --> 31:43.335
- What was she crying over?

31:43.369 --> 31:45.704
- She just came in
and she was screaming

31:45.737 --> 31:47.974
and she just, like--
"I fricking hate

31:47.974 --> 31:49.675
Scheana and Ariana right now."

31:49.708 --> 31:52.811
- I just don't know
how things get...

31:52.844 --> 31:54.746
so blown out of proportion.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.748
- You don't think

31:56.782 --> 31:59.085
in any way Katie's so mad

31:59.118 --> 32:01.687
that she would kick you out
from being a bridesmaid?

32:01.720 --> 32:04.090
- Um, I mean,
I would certainly hope not.

32:04.123 --> 32:07.659
- No, it's--
Don't stay mad.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.361
- Am I gonna be disinvited?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.830
Is Katie gonna demote me
from the bridal party?

32:11.863 --> 32:13.832
Like, I just don't even
know where I stand

32:13.865 --> 32:16.635
with my friends right now,
and it's giving me anxiety.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.038
- You guys are going to Montauk
this weekend, right?

32:19.071 --> 32:21.773
- I'm clearly not allowed
to go to Sonoma,

32:21.807 --> 32:23.342
so do I have a choice?

32:23.375 --> 32:25.911
- Okay, we've already
gotten NASCAR tickets.

32:26.012 --> 32:27.479
- We already had to get passes,

32:27.513 --> 32:29.481
and to get passes,
we had to give names.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.283
- Like, you can't come with us.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.485
- So I need to fix this.
- Right, and you do,

32:33.519 --> 32:36.022
and you will,
but just fix it soon.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.789
You'll be the peacemaker
this week.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.658
You're gonna go and you're
gonna have a good time.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.728
You'll still be a bridesmaid.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.031
We hope.
[chuckles]

32:45.031 --> 32:52.038
*

32:52.038 --> 32:54.406
- Nikolai?
- What?

32:54.440 --> 32:56.742
- Come here.
I need to ask you advice.

32:56.775 --> 32:59.145
*

32:59.178 --> 33:01.480
- Did you start the fight?
Did you--did you start it?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.149
- I don't remember
who started the--

33:03.182 --> 33:05.051
- It's beer.
It's just beer.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.952
Did you guys go a bar
to that night?

33:07.053 --> 33:09.421
- Well, we drank,
but we didn't go to a bar.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.923
Like, we were partying--
- How much did you drink?

33:11.957 --> 33:14.093
A lot?
- That's not fair.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.895
Scheana said stuff to Katie
that was really mean.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.065
Things that, like, you just
don't say to your friend.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.732
If you're best friends,
we don't do that.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.168
We want to support each other,

33:22.201 --> 33:24.203
and so I was very upset
about all of this,

33:24.236 --> 33:26.738
and then I heard that Scheana
was saying things that were--

33:26.772 --> 33:29.241
- Stay out of what's
other people's business.

33:29.275 --> 33:30.676
It's not your business.
That's your problem.

33:30.709 --> 33:31.843
You get into
other people's business.

33:31.877 --> 33:32.944
- Don't tell me
that's my problem.

33:32.978 --> 33:34.113
That I get into--
- That is your problem!

33:34.146 --> 33:35.547
- Sometimes people don't know

33:35.581 --> 33:37.083
when they should apologize,

33:37.116 --> 33:38.917
so I need to tell Scheana

33:38.950 --> 33:42.088
that she did something wrong
and she needs to apologize.

33:42.088 --> 33:45.557
- She needs to figure
that herself.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.126
You're not the boss.

33:47.159 --> 33:48.360
You're not
the boss.

33:48.394 --> 33:49.861
- Yes, I am.

33:49.895 --> 33:51.197
- No, you're not.
- What are you even saying?

33:51.230 --> 33:54.433
Okay, fine,
Nikolai gives great advice,

33:54.466 --> 33:56.335
but he's, like, 11,
so I'm--

33:56.368 --> 33:58.570
I'm not gonna listen to him.

33:58.604 --> 34:02.108
- If you be bossy
and it's always your way,

34:02.108 --> 34:04.143
people are not gonna like that.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.312
- F--- that.
- Okay?

34:06.345 --> 34:07.313
- Coming up...

34:07.346 --> 34:08.814
- Ready to go.
- Yeah?

34:08.847 --> 34:10.116
- All the ducks are in a row.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.118
- So we're all
on the same flight?

- Hey, look at you.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.301
- Hi.
Thanks.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.670
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.341
- Today is Ariana's birthday.

34:35.374 --> 34:37.443
Last year,
Ariana wanted one thing,

34:37.476 --> 34:38.677
and that was for me

34:38.710 --> 34:41.147
not to go to Vegas
and drive bulldozers.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.949
Apparently he told me that we're
going to a construction yard

34:43.982 --> 34:45.551
and we're taking bulldozers

34:45.584 --> 34:48.154
and, like, crushing sh--
with bulldozers.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.888
[soft dramatic music]

34:49.921 --> 34:52.258
This year,
I've organized the best trip

34:52.291 --> 34:54.860
a girl from Florida
could ever wish for...

34:54.893 --> 34:57.263
Oh, socks from last time.
Sweet.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.898
And that is NASCAR

34:59.931 --> 35:01.267

35:10.309 --> 35:11.610
- Hey.
both: Hello.

35:11.643 --> 35:12.878
- What's up?
- What's up, guys?

35:12.911 --> 35:14.045
- How are you guys?

35:14.079 --> 35:16.047
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

35:16.081 --> 35:17.616
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

35:17.649 --> 35:20.552
- Okay, we had, like,
a really cute balloon,

35:20.586 --> 35:22.221
and it blew away.
- What's up, dude?

35:22.254 --> 35:23.389
- [laughs]
- I felt so bad.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.890
I was like, "This is so lame."

35:24.923 --> 35:26.358
Like, "Here's a box of tequila."

35:26.392 --> 35:28.660
- I like it.
Thank you.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.629
- Can you guys believe
that we leave tomorrow?

35:30.662 --> 35:32.598
- You know, I didn't want
to have the kind of birthday

35:32.631 --> 35:34.200
where I was having
to get dressed up

35:34.233 --> 35:36.335
and doing makeup all the time
and wondering, like,

35:36.368 --> 35:39.538
"Am I cute enough?
Am I wearing the right outfit?"

35:39.571 --> 35:41.873
And--I mean, in short,
I didn't want to be in Montauk.

35:41.907 --> 35:44.776
- I won't be there.
I'm missing out.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.045
You guys are gonna have
so much fun, though.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.480
- This is the second year
in a row

35:48.514 --> 35:50.216
that I haven't been invited
to Ariana's birthday,

35:50.216 --> 35:52.050
and last year,
I kind of get it.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.219
We weren't as close.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.720
But this year, I feel like

35:54.753 --> 35:56.855
everybody else
wants me there except Jax,

35:56.888 --> 35:59.124
and it--that little bitch
is getting his way again.

35:59.225 --> 36:01.693
- Everything is all

36:01.727 --> 36:02.928
ready to go.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.896
- Yeah?
- All the ducks are in a row.

36:04.930 --> 36:08.667
- Has Jax had, like, an issue
with me coming to your birthday?

36:08.700 --> 36:10.569
- No, not that I know of.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.471
Jax sometimes says things some--

36:12.504 --> 36:14.340
that no one should
pay attention to.

36:14.373 --> 36:15.741
- Well, Jax has said
a lot of things.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.043
- Are you crazy?
Are you delusional?

36:18.076 --> 36:19.044
Okay, nobody wants
to be your friend.

36:19.077 --> 36:20.246
Grow up.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.447
You're nobody.
You're nobody.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.614
- If I'm nobody--
- Go sling some more d---

36:22.648 --> 36:24.082

yeah.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.417
You're f---ing an old man

36:25.451 --> 36:27.152
who's married and has kids!

36:27.253 --> 36:30.456
- You guys just know how his,
like, bullying ways work.

36:30.489 --> 36:33.792
- I've seen the way these people
have treated each other.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.294
They're best friends one day,

36:35.327 --> 36:37.729
and they want to kill each other
the next.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.465
- I won't be there to, like,

36:39.498 --> 36:41.267
f---ing snap back
at him either,

36:41.267 --> 36:42.901
so he'll--he'll be able to talk
all the sh-- he wants.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.304
- Yeah, but nobody really
is gonna want to hear that.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.739

How are you?

- Uh, yeah, she's in the VIP.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.096
I think so.
- All right, cool.

I'm gonna go say hello to her.

I'm fine.

37:28.314 --> 37:29.648
I'm busy.
- I know.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.684
I just wanted to come in
and, you know, um...

37:32.718 --> 37:34.386
- What is there to talk about?

37:34.420 --> 37:37.323
- I just wanted to say,
I miss working for you.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.525
You know, I really love
you and Ken so much.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.893

what I had for granted,

I don't want you

37:46.698 --> 37:48.334

37:48.367 --> 37:51.069

Sorry.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.938
- That's disrespectful.
- You're right.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.574

did you a favor.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.343
- I don't think so.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.678
Lisa should hire me back
not only because

37:59.711 --> 38:01.880
I've been better
at being sober and stuff,

38:01.913 --> 38:04.182
but, quite frankly, I'm the best
DJ she's had at Sur.

I know the talent I have.

into becoming the expert

what you think.

I'm telling you.

to reality.

you were an arrogant
little punk.

38:19.998 --> 38:20.966
And look at me.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.200
do I look like somebody

38:22.233 --> 38:24.370
that employs
an arrogant little punk?

38:24.403 --> 38:27.005
- No, but you have done
in the past with Jax.

38:27.038 --> 38:30.141
*

38:30.175 --> 38:33.979
- I'm not saying Jax displays
exemplary behavior,

38:34.012 --> 38:37.115
but in his workplace,
he's never been disrespectful.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.985
- That's a lie.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.287
That's no--that's not true.
- So you're calling me a liar?

38:42.388 --> 38:43.689
- No, but that's not true
about Jax.

38:43.722 --> 38:44.923
- So you come in here
and you use the F-bomb

38:44.956 --> 38:46.525
and you call me a liar
and you expect me

38:46.558 --> 38:47.793
to give you the time of day?
- Lisa, I was not trying

38:47.826 --> 38:49.094
to do that, okay?
I just wanted--

38:49.127 --> 38:50.396
- I'm saying
he's not disrespectful to me.

38:50.396 --> 38:51.797
You have been disrespectful
to me.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.432
You can't stop yourself.

38:53.465 --> 38:56.267
My life is actually better
without you in it.

38:56.301 --> 38:58.837
I'm being honest.
It's less problematic.

38:58.870 --> 39:01.139
- I just want you to know
that I'm not drinking right now

39:01.172 --> 39:02.808
and that I've been
hanging out with Max,

39:02.841 --> 39:04.510
and he's seen
a small difference in me

39:04.543 --> 39:05.744
since we've been hanging
for this week...

39:05.777 --> 39:07.312
- But a week is nothing.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.715
A week in--in the big picture
is nothing.

39:09.748 --> 39:10.916
- I don't want to do it anymore.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.283
- [sighs]
- It's already really ruined

39:12.317 --> 39:13.952
a lot of opportunities
for me already.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.754
I'm still DJ'ing, thank God,
and still doing things.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.022
I miss it at Sur.
I miss you very much.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.625
- Maybe you should do
another job.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.493
You should choose
another career path

39:21.527 --> 39:22.661
apart from DJ'ing.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.295
- Has she lost her mind?

39:24.329 --> 39:25.764
I mean, it's not like
you could picture me

39:25.797 --> 39:27.298
in the middle of a cubicle
9:00 to 5:00

39:27.332 --> 39:29.067
selling f---ing insurance.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.770
"Hi, hi, this is,
uh, James Kennedy.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.705
I'm trying to se--"
Beep.

39:33.739 --> 39:37.042
Nah.
It's DJ James Kennedy.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.110
- Time is money, James.
- I apologize.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.712
I don't want to keep you
any longer.

39:40.746 --> 39:42.247
- And I have enough money,
but I don't have enough time.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.116
So are we done?
- Yeah.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.486
All right, thank you.
Have a lovely day, okay?

39:47.519 --> 39:49.220
- There's a great moral
to this story,

39:49.254 --> 39:50.722
and it's the oldest thing
in the world.

39:50.756 --> 39:53.759
You don't know what you had
until it's gone.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.461
Ain't that the truth?

39:55.461 --> 39:56.995
James is gone.

39:57.028 --> 39:57.996
- * Go, go, go, go

39:58.029 --> 39:59.297
[pop music]

39:59.330 --> 40:00.466
* Go
- All righty.

40:00.499 --> 40:01.967
- * Never ever let go

40:02.000 --> 40:04.035
- * Go, go, go, go

40:04.069 --> 40:06.705
* Go
- * Never ever let go

40:06.738 --> 40:08.807
- * Go, go, go, go
- * Go, go, go

40:08.840 --> 40:11.276
both: * Go
- * Never ever let go

40:11.309 --> 40:14.012
- * Go, go, go, go
- * Go, go, go, go

40:14.045 --> 40:18.283
both: * Never ever let me go
- * Go, go, go, go

40:18.316 --> 40:19.284
- Coming up...

40:19.317 --> 40:20.786
- Where's Lala?

40:20.819 --> 40:22.287
- Nobody knows.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.722
What is she gonna do?

40:30.161 --> 40:30.496
[pop music]

40:33.765 --> 40:36.735
- * Let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide

40:36.768 --> 40:41.172
* Livin' that li-i-i-i-i-ife

40:41.206 --> 40:44.209
* Let's ri-i-i-i-i-ide

40:44.242 --> 40:47.879
* Livin' that li-i-i-i-i-ife

40:47.913 --> 40:49.681
*

40:49.715 --> 40:52.017
- I'm really excited
about this trip.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.819
We're flying up
to San Francisco

40:53.852 --> 40:55.921
and then
to mother----ing NASCAR.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.055
It's gonna be badass.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.790
- Some cheese, some lettuce,
and bread.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.225
It's all you need in life.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.961
- It's Ariana's birthday trip.
Let's do this.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.797
Where's Lala?

41:05.831 --> 41:08.199
- Nobody knows.
- You know?

41:08.233 --> 41:10.736
- No, I don't.
I texted her.

41:10.769 --> 41:13.872
- I texted her too.
I told her to get her ass here.

41:13.905 --> 41:17.175
- I said, "Where you at,
question mark,

41:17.208 --> 41:18.844
exclamation point."

41:18.877 --> 41:20.445
- Yeah.

41:20.546 --> 41:21.980
- What is she gonna do?

41:22.013 --> 41:23.715
- I don't know.

41:23.749 --> 41:24.783
That's messed up,

41:24.816 --> 41:25.884
because we could have gotten

41:25.917 --> 41:27.719
somebody else
to fill her spot.

41:27.753 --> 41:31.690
- This is a super early flight,
but part of me feels like,

41:31.723 --> 41:33.992
"Is she standing us up?"

41:34.025 --> 41:36.461
- Where's Lala?
- She's not here.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.163
- She'll probably
show up last second.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.164
[dramatic music]

41:39.197 --> 41:42.568
- Fire device.
- [laughs]

41:42.568 --> 41:45.036
[line ringing]

41:45.070 --> 41:46.905
- The terminal gate areas
are limited

41:46.938 --> 41:48.874
to ticketed passengers only

41:48.907 --> 41:52.410
or those authorized adults
escorting unaccompanied minors.

41:52.443 --> 41:53.411
*

41:53.444 --> 41:55.413
[bell chimes]

41:55.446 --> 41:56.915
- All set.
[scanner beeps]

41:56.948 --> 41:59.918
*

41:59.951 --> 42:02.353
- I want to make it
the best birthday ever

42:02.387 --> 42:03.589
for Ariana,

42:03.622 --> 42:06.291
and if anybody
stands in the way of that,

42:06.324 --> 42:07.726
I'm gonna be pissed.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.094
And right now,
I'm asking myself,

42:09.127 --> 42:10.729
"Where the f--- is Lala?"

42:10.762 --> 42:12.330
*

42:12.363 --> 42:15.366
[jet engine whirring]

42:17.502 --> 42:19.437
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:19.470 --> 42:21.339
- Welcome to Montauk!
[all giggling]

42:21.372 --> 42:23.274
- Welcome to the Sonoma Express!

42:23.308 --> 42:25.076
- Whoo!

42:25.110 --> 42:26.311
- Everything's
finally going right,

42:26.344 --> 42:28.113
but, oh, what do I do?
I got to f--- this up somehow

42:28.146 --> 42:30.248
because that's what Jax does.
- I need to have sex.

42:30.281 --> 42:31.449
I want to have sex.

42:31.482 --> 42:32.951
- Have you heard from Lala
at all?

42:32.984 --> 42:34.853
- The only thing
I can think of is that

42:34.886 --> 42:38.223
she's completely wrapped
around this guy's finger.

42:38.256 --> 42:39.758
- Let this not be,
like, one of those trips

42:39.791 --> 42:40.992
where's she's just like,

42:41.026 --> 42:42.961
"Well, I don't want to do,
like, certain things."

42:42.994 --> 42:44.462
Well, we're doing
green tea shots.

42:44.495 --> 42:47.165
- One of those,
I will be hungover.

42:47.198 --> 42:48.499
- You don't even have
a boyfriend,

42:48.533 --> 42:49.901
so shut the f--- up,
birthday girl.

42:49.935 --> 42:51.870
- Jesus Christ.
- [laughs]

42:51.903 --> 42:54.640
- Are you crying?

42:54.640 --> 42:56.107
- To see more
of "Vanderpump Rules,"

42:56.141 --> 42:57.643
go to bravotv.com.
