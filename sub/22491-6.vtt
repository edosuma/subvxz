00:18.818 --> 00:20.718
It's alive!

00:44.244 --> 00:47.941
This here's my town,
and I won't let you take it.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.074
You just try and stop us.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.289
All in a day's work, kids.

01:05.598 --> 01:07.429
Kids, what are you doing?!

01:08.568 --> 01:10.229
Help!

01:14.140 --> 01:15.402
Paper cut!

01:15.442 --> 01:17.307
Hollywood's turned everything...

01:17.343 --> 01:19.208
from old TV shows to video games...

01:19.245 --> 01:21.372
to theme park rides into movies.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.439
Now they're tackling board games...

01:23.483 --> 01:27.681
guaranteeing audiences
will be unbored this summer.

01:30.290 --> 01:35.284
In a town torn apart by crime,
the heroes bite back!

01:35.328 --> 01:39.287
- You boys sure are hungry.
- Hungry for justice!

01:44.437 --> 01:47.133
A hippo playing pool.
I'd like to see that.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.164
Fine. I'll break.

01:50.176 --> 01:51.939
It's a race!

01:56.182 --> 01:57.547
Help! Hippos!

01:57.584 --> 01:59.518
It's a chase!

02:03.656 --> 02:06.716
So, hurry up and feed your face.

02:12.165 --> 02:15.430
I always knew them hippos was trouble.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.531
Officer John Chutes
was born to be a cop.

02:20.573 --> 02:23.508
Officer Mikey Ladders
was born to be wild.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.738
You weren't just robbing
one man, you know.

02:25.778 --> 02:29.111
You gotta think of the socio-economic
realities of the situation.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.844
Sorry, am I punching you too hard?

02:30.884 --> 02:32.146
But this summer...

02:32.185 --> 02:35.313
Officer Chutes and Officer Ladders
are born to be...

02:35.355 --> 02:36.379
Partners?!

02:36.422 --> 02:39.585
OK, well, let's just do
what we do best.

02:48.635 --> 02:52.230
You kids need to give me some respect!
My dodge balls!

02:52.272 --> 02:53.796
Grandma's ashes!

02:56.809 --> 02:59.505
Ben Stiller. Owen Wilson.

02:59.546 --> 03:03.414
Yeah, OK. I'm enthusiastic.
This is good. This is nice spaghetti.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.041
Chutes and Ladders.

03:05.084 --> 03:08.520
Also, catch Ben Stiller
in the following movies this summer.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.915
All we need to do is get past security...

03:12.959 --> 03:15.257
disable the alarms, break into the vault...

03:15.295 --> 03:18.492
and carry $400 billion
in untraceable bills out of the casino.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.520
I think I got a way.

03:22.635 --> 03:24.603
That's what I call a royal flush!

03:24.637 --> 03:26.502
Jackpot, daddy-o!

03:27.807 --> 03:29.138
Slip 'n' Slide: The Movie.

03:29.175 --> 03:33.908
This summer, action is all wet and plastic
and you can slide on it.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.624
Massage chair...

03:48.661 --> 03:52.188
if we lived in Canada,
I would make you my bride.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.359
- Skeletor!
- Oh, no.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.460
It's Mo-Larr, Eternian Dentist.

03:57.503 --> 04:00.301
You missed your 10:15 appointment!

04:00.340 --> 04:02.274
I'm busy, Mo-Larr.

04:02.308 --> 04:05.675
You have an impacted
wisdom tooth, Skeletor!

04:05.712 --> 04:06.940
It has to come out!

04:06.980 --> 04:09.676
I'm a talking skull! What do I care if...

04:09.716 --> 04:11.741
You know what?
The hell with this.

04:13.319 --> 04:17.813
The boss man says
his appointment is cancelled!

04:19.325 --> 04:21.793
I'm all out of mint flavor.

04:24.797 --> 04:27.163
How come beast-man
got the dental floss...

04:27.200 --> 04:29.828
and I got the fucking drill in my eye?!

04:35.008 --> 04:37.101
Success!

04:37.143 --> 04:39.111
You son of a bitch!

04:40.980 --> 04:43.676
Comes with everything you see here.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.517
造 M-e-a-t
m- a-c-h-i-n-e 造

04:46.552 --> 04:49.248
造 Meat machine,
meat machine, all right, break 造

04:50.390 --> 04:55.020
So, I threw the Senate at him.
The whole Senate. True story.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.120
Oh, my God.
That is so funny.

04:57.163 --> 04:59.290
You made it come out of my nose.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.125
Go for Papa Palpatine.

05:03.169 --> 05:06.138
You have a collect call from...

05:06.172 --> 05:07.537
Darth Vader.

05:08.574 --> 05:12.510
I gotta take this. Hold on.
Vader, how's my favorite Sith?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.479
Just slow down.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.718
What do you mean they blew up
the Death Star?!

05:22.655 --> 05:27.422
Fuck, oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Who's they?!

05:28.594 --> 05:32.121
What the hell
is an Aluminum Falcon?!

05:32.165 --> 05:36.534
OK, OK. So, who's left?
Are you shitting me?!

05:36.569 --> 05:38.560
Well, where are you?!
Wait a sec.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.971
You've been flying around for two weeks
trying to get a signal?

05:42.008 --> 05:47.344
You must smell like feet
wrapped in leathery, burnt bacon.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.982
I'm sorry.
I thought my Dark Lord of the Sith...

05:51.017 --> 05:54.453
could protect a small thermal
exhaust port only two meters wide.

05:54.487 --> 05:57.047
That thing wasn't even fully paid off yet!

05:57.090 --> 06:00.253
Do you have any idea
what this is gonna do to my credit?

06:00.293 --> 06:02.261
Hang on. I got another call.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.593
What?! I'm very busy right now!

06:06.566 --> 06:08.830
Well, where are they going?

06:08.868 --> 06:12.167
All right.
Just get me a turkey club.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.573
Coleslaw, I guess.
I'm not even gonna eat it.

06:16.609 --> 06:17.974
What are you getting?

06:19.011 --> 06:21.673
No, see, I always order the wrong thing.

06:21.714 --> 06:25.616
No, no, no. I'll just stick with that.
OK, bye. Wait, what?

06:25.651 --> 06:27.915
Cherry coke. Thanks.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.354
Sorry about that.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.584
What?

06:31.624 --> 06:35.082
Just rebuild it?!
Real fucking original!

06:35.128 --> 06:37.688
And who's going to give me
a loan, jack-hole, you?!

06:37.730 --> 06:40.198
You got an ATM on that torso Lite-Brite?

06:40.233 --> 06:42.394
Get your 7'2" asthmatic ass back here...

06:42.435 --> 06:45.268
or I'll tell everyone
what a whiney bitch you were...

06:45.304 --> 06:49.570
about Patomommi or Panda Bear
or whatever the hell her name is!

06:49.609 --> 06:51.304
Jeez! He's crying.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.541
Come on. Come on. Don't do that.

06:56.582 --> 07:00.074
Just... Look, you know,
I'm just dealing with a lot of crap right now.

07:00.119 --> 07:03.850
Death Star blown up by a bunch
of fucking teenagers, you know...

07:03.890 --> 07:06.484
I didn't mean to snap.

07:07.994 --> 07:14.490
Just get back here. OK. OK, bye.
I... Yeah. I...

07:14.534 --> 07:16.126
I love you, too.

07:16.169 --> 07:19.036
And then this sap will be
made into yummy maple syrup.

07:19.071 --> 07:20.732
Now, what is wrong here?

07:21.808 --> 07:23.901
Almost there.
Almost there.

07:24.343 --> 07:26.208
This in the name of science, boy.

07:26.245 --> 07:29.476
We gonna conduct an experiment
up inside Uranus.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.983
Now, squeal like a pig!

07:38.357 --> 07:39.824
Pressure's down to 60.

07:39.859 --> 07:43.488
Damn it! He's losing too much blood.
Don't you die on me, you hear?!

07:43.529 --> 07:45.895
Nurse, get me more O-neg, stat!

08:10.156 --> 08:12.818
- Feeling better?
- I feel great.

08:12.859 --> 08:13.883
Finish him!

08:16.662 --> 08:19.062
Good night, love bug!

08:19.098 --> 08:21.328
You know, you gotta watch that flirting.

08:21.367 --> 08:25.326
It'll get you into trouble! Trouble.

08:46.392 --> 08:49.054
What have you been sleeping on?

08:49.095 --> 08:52.496
Pan-global oil keeps dumping
sludge into the Atlantic Ocean.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.898
That burns my ass!

08:54.934 --> 08:57.334
Forget it, Ted.
There's nothing you can do.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.962
Maybe I can't...

08:59.005 --> 09:01.633
but Captain Planet can!

09:04.911 --> 09:07.778
Captain Planet!

09:12.818 --> 09:14.752
Captain Planet!

09:15.821 --> 09:18.949
Captain Planet!

09:24.030 --> 09:25.054
Captain Planet!

09:25.097 --> 09:28.589
- Where will we dump our sludge next?
- The Grand Canyon could hold a lot of it.

09:28.634 --> 09:29.726
It sure could.

09:29.769 --> 09:32.067
Let's sludge the hell
out of the Grand Canyon.

09:32.104 --> 09:35.335
- Is that Ted Turner?
- I think it is. What the hell's he doing?

09:35.374 --> 09:37.001
He's on one of those zip-lines.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.204
Is that what they're called, zip-lines?

09:39.245 --> 09:42.612
- Well, I always thought it was...
- Captain Planet!

09:42.648 --> 09:46.379
- You got glass in my eye!
- And my foot in your balls!

09:46.419 --> 09:48.512
Captain Planet!

09:49.155 --> 09:50.782
What do you want, Mr. Turner?!

09:50.823 --> 09:54.816
Just sign this pledge not to dump
any more sludge and I'll let you go!

09:54.860 --> 09:58.455
- OK, OK!
- This appears to be in order.

09:58.497 --> 10:00.260
Captain Planet!

10:05.204 --> 10:08.605
Protect the environment
or I'll fucking kill you!

10:08.641 --> 10:11.735
Captain Planet!

10:11.777 --> 10:15.440
You heard it here, folks. The biggest
catch-phrase of the new millennium...

10:15.481 --> 10:18.211
will be "Captain Planet!"
My friends say it all the time.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.946
And then kick each other in the nuts.
That's awesome!

10:20.987 --> 10:23.854
As the opening credit sequence
basically tells you...

10:23.889 --> 10:26.221
you are the chicken
forced to watch this shit.

10:26.258 --> 10:27.657
Am I getting paid for this?

10:27.693 --> 10:30.594
If I had a toy of myself,
I'd have to make out with it.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.495
Twinkie the kid. That's topical.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.126
Here's another great thing.
We're gonna do movie parodies.

10:38.170 --> 10:41.435
Does the world need another
Owen Wilson - Ben Stiller movie?

10:41.474 --> 10:43.533
The answer is an emphatic yes.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.737
Chutes and Ladders.
Are you kidding me?!

10:45.778 --> 10:48.076
A travesty!
This is comedy to these people.

10:48.114 --> 10:51.174
Yes, yes, yes, and more yes.

10:52.284 --> 10:55.412
When your career was on the down
slope, you'd to go to infomercials.

10:55.454 --> 10:57.046
Now, you go to Robot Chicken.

10:58.557 --> 11:00.024
The best Robot Chicken ever.

11:00.059 --> 11:03.028
Couldn't be a more opposite statement.
That show stinks.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.530
It's not gay, it's masturbation.

11:05.564 --> 11:09.432
People watch this on television!
They chose this!
