WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:09.176
* If I could walk

00:09.210 --> 00:12.545
* Oh

00:12.580 --> 00:16.716
* You know I'd never lie.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.021
(applause)

00:31.099 --> 00:32.700
Oz, hey!

00:32.732 --> 00:35.868
Have a seat... except,
we don't have any seats.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.871
It's okay.
I'll just scrunch in.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.874
Xander?

00:40.908 --> 00:42.210
Why are you giving
me a lap dance?

00:42.243 --> 00:43.610
What?
I just like you.

00:43.643 --> 00:45.012
WILLOW:
And that's very beautiful.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.280
I think it's great

00:46.314 --> 00:48.216
when two people
like two people

00:48.249 --> 00:50.683
and want to be close to them
instead of anyone else.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.884
Hear, hear!

00:51.918 --> 00:54.188
Yeah, well put.
Hey, can I snag a sip?

00:54.222 --> 00:55.889
Sure.
Yeah, you got it.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.460
(applause)

00:59.493 --> 01:01.060
Thank you!

01:01.094 --> 01:03.631
Thank you.
Uh, we're here through Saturday.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.798
Enjoy the veal.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.201
Why are you
guys so hyper?

01:08.236 --> 01:10.570
Hey, speaking of people

01:10.603 --> 01:13.240
and things they do that
aren't like usual,

01:13.274 --> 01:16.075
anyone notice Buffy
acting sort of different?

01:16.109 --> 01:18.811
Let's see, uh, killing zombies,

01:18.846 --> 01:20.881
uh, torching sewer monsters...

01:20.914 --> 01:22.415
And no, that's, uh,

01:22.450 --> 01:24.617
pretty much the, uh,
same old Buffster.

01:24.652 --> 01:28.087
Well, I just mean, you know,
she's off by herself a lot more.

01:28.121 --> 01:30.490
And she's kind of distracted.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.725
Think maybe she
has a new honey?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.728
A boyfriend?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.296
Why wouldn't she tell us?

01:36.329 --> 01:37.897
Excuse me?

01:37.930 --> 01:39.832
When your last steady
killed half the class,

01:39.866 --> 01:41.602
and then your rebound guy
sends you a dump-o-gram?

01:41.634 --> 01:43.837
It makes a girl shy.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.105
But we're the best
of Buffy's bestest buds.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.575
She'd tell us.
Tell you what?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.277
About your new boyfriend,
who we made up--

01:50.311 --> 01:52.246
unless we didn't?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.281
This was a topic
 of discussion?

01:54.314 --> 01:55.682
Well, raised,
but never discussed.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.152
So, are you dating
somebody or not?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.256
I wouldn't use
the word "dating,"

02:02.290 --> 02:04.123
but I am going out
with somebody.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.492
Tonight, as a matter of fact.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.027
Really?
Who?

02:07.060 --> 02:09.663
Yo, what's up? Hey,
time to motorvate.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.098
Really, we're just
good friends.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.201
(both grunting)

02:27.647 --> 02:29.650
(grunting)

02:50.069 --> 02:51.739
Synchronized slaying.

02:51.771 --> 02:53.206
New Olympic category?

02:53.240 --> 02:54.875
What do you think?

02:54.908 --> 02:56.843
WOMAN:
Sloppy.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.713
You telegraph punches,
leave blind sides open

03:00.747 --> 03:02.349
and, for a school-night slaying,

03:02.383 --> 03:04.485
take entirely too much time.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.219
Which one of you is Faith?

03:06.253 --> 03:07.153
FAITH:
It depends.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.056
Who the hell are you?

03:09.088 --> 03:10.490
Gwendolyn Post.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.092
Mrs.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.593
Your new watcher.

03:19.633 --> 03:23.036
(wolf howling)

03:23.069 --> 03:26.473
*

04:13.287 --> 04:14.754
FAITH:
I'm telling you.

04:14.788 --> 04:15.989
I don't need a new watcher.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.591
No offense, lady.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.160
I just have this problem
with authority figures.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.262
They end up kind of dead.

04:22.295 --> 04:26.399
Duly noted, and fortunately,
it's not up to you.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.536
Mr. Giles, where do you keep
the rest of your books?

04:30.036 --> 04:31.639
I-I'm sorry.
"The rest"?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.507
Yes, the actual library.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.177
Oh, I see.

04:37.209 --> 04:39.579
I can assure you,
Mrs. Post,

04:39.612 --> 04:41.014
this is the finest
occult reference collection--

04:41.048 --> 04:43.283
This side of the Atlantic,
I'm sure.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.920
Do you have
 Hume's Paranormal Encyclopedia?

04:46.954 --> 04:50.824
The Labyrinth Maps of Malta?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.627
It's on order.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.995
Well, I suppose that you have

04:55.028 --> 04:56.430
Sir Robert Kane's
 Twilight Compendium?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.365
Oh, uh...

04:57.398 --> 04:59.199
Yes, I... yes.

04:59.231 --> 05:01.033
Yes, I do.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.870
Yes, of course you do.

05:02.903 --> 05:06.005
I have been sent
by the Council

05:06.038 --> 05:07.641
for a very important reason.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.643
Faith needs a watcher.

05:09.677 --> 05:13.180
I am to act in that
capacity and report back.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.384
Excuse me, Mary Poppins,
you don't seem to be listening--

05:16.417 --> 05:20.153
Faith, if the Council feels that
you need closer observation,
then, uh,

05:20.187 --> 05:23.456
we will all, of
course, cooperate.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.625
The Council wishes me to report
on the entire situation here,

05:25.658 --> 05:27.961
including you.

05:27.995 --> 05:32.466
Hmm, academic probation's not
so funny today, huh, Giles?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.233
MRS. POST:
The fact is

05:34.266 --> 05:35.403
there is talk
in the Council

05:35.435 --> 05:37.170
that you have
become a bit too

05:37.204 --> 05:38.471
American.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.473
Me?
Him?

05:40.507 --> 05:43.411
A demon named Lagos is
coming here to the Hellmouth.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.680
Mr. Giles, an illustration
of Lagos, if you please.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.749
Oh, uh... yes, uh...

05:51.451 --> 05:52.819
Perhaps later.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.021
Lagos seeks

05:55.055 --> 05:57.324
the Glove of Myhnegon.

05:57.356 --> 06:00.394
No record of this glove's
full power exists.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.228
But we do know
it is highly dangerous

06:02.262 --> 06:04.997
and must not fall
into the hands of a demon.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.899
Lagos must
be stopped.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.502
Uh, what-what do you propose?

06:09.536 --> 06:10.937
Well, if it's not
too radical a suggestion,

06:10.971 --> 06:12.872
I thought we might kill him.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.908
I suggest two slayers
at full strength

06:15.942 --> 06:17.845
for a coordinated hunt.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.447
We believe the glove to be
buried in a tomb somewhere,

06:20.480 --> 06:22.348
so Lagos will be headed
for the cemetery.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.552
There is more than one
in Sunnydale.

06:24.584 --> 06:25.685
I see.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.555
How many?

06:27.588 --> 06:30.723
Uh, 12, within
the city limits.

06:30.757 --> 06:33.961
Well, we'll just have to
take them one at a time.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.529
Anything in your books
that might pinpoint

06:36.564 --> 06:39.533
the exact location of
the tomb would be useful.

06:39.567 --> 06:42.302
But then, we cannot
ask for miracles.

06:42.334 --> 06:44.403
We will begin

06:44.437 --> 06:45.805
tomorrow at sunset.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.106
Faith?

06:47.139 --> 06:48.641
With me, please.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.485
That was bracing.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.552
Interesting lady.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.420
Can we kill her?

07:01.454 --> 07:02.923
I think the Council
might frown upon that.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.759
Well... uh, how do you feel

07:05.793 --> 07:08.427
about a spot of training?

07:36.624 --> 07:39.026
*

08:04.752 --> 08:05.786
Uh...

08:05.819 --> 08:08.555
I got to go.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.923
Big night for us
slayer types.

08:12.358 --> 08:14.326
People to see.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.529
Demons to kill.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.832
Better hurry before somebody
figures out what we're doing.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.834
What are we doing?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.903
Training.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.908
And almost kissing.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.812
Sorry.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.346
It's just...

08:33.379 --> 08:35.014
old habit.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.850
Bad, bad habit...

08:36.884 --> 08:39.186
to be broken.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.520
It's hard.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.389
It's not hard.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.491
Cold turkey.

08:45.524 --> 08:47.595
That's the key to quitting.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.902
You think they make
a patch for this?

08:54.934 --> 08:57.037
You have to go.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.370
I really do.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.110
I'm gonna try

09:03.143 --> 09:04.878
and vent a little hormonal angst

09:04.912 --> 09:07.447
by going out there
and killing a Lagos.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.682
Whatever that is.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.383
Lagos?

09:10.417 --> 09:13.721
Some demon looking for some
all-powerful thingamabob,

09:13.754 --> 09:15.688
and I got to stop him
before he unleashes

09:15.722 --> 09:17.190
unholy havoc,
and it's another

09:17.224 --> 09:19.626
Tuesday night in Sunnydale.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.663
Be careful.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.244
God, this is intolerable.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.312
There's not a word here
about Lagos or the glove.

09:40.346 --> 09:43.482
We don't have time
for this near-missing.

09:43.515 --> 09:45.885
Just find out all you can
about the demon.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.386
(stammers)
Its strengths,

09:47.419 --> 09:49.056
its weaknesses,
its places of origin--

09:49.088 --> 09:50.557
and most importantly,

09:50.590 --> 09:53.592
what it plans to do
with this blasted glove.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.796
Hey, you're not
the watcher of me.

09:55.828 --> 09:58.631
Then go home, but if you
choose to stay, then work.

10:02.201 --> 10:03.971
Ugh.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.739
It's late.
I'm tired.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.140
What does he want
from us, anyway?

10:08.174 --> 10:10.009
The number of
a qualified surgeon

10:10.043 --> 10:13.046
to remove the British flag
from his butt?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.886
My eyes are all blurry.

10:21.553 --> 10:23.056
(groans)

10:39.206 --> 10:40.539
Oh, stop.

10:40.572 --> 10:42.609
Right.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.211
Stop means no.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.613
And no means no,

10:46.645 --> 10:49.282
so, um...

10:49.316 --> 10:50.817
stop.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.229
Willow, Xander?

11:02.261 --> 11:05.231
You can stop your,
uh, studying.

11:05.264 --> 11:07.768
I've got what I need.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.636
What have you got?

11:10.669 --> 11:11.671
Uh,
the probable location

11:11.705 --> 11:14.173
of the Glove of Myhnegon.

11:14.206 --> 11:17.509
It's, uh, housed in
the Von Hauptman family crypt.

11:17.543 --> 11:21.548
Yeah, that's, uh, that big one
over at the Restfield cemetery.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.082
Yeah, well,
that's great, Giles.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.152
Um, how'd you find it?

11:25.184 --> 11:26.820
I looked.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.755
Where's Buffy at?

11:28.788 --> 11:30.423
Uh, I'm not sure.

11:30.456 --> 11:33.225
Well, I'll go check out
this, uh, crypt.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.427
Um, tell her heads-up
if she, uh, stops by.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.830
Yes, by all means, go.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.831
And I'll just keep studying.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.334
I think we're on the verge
of a big Lagos breakthrough.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.937
No, I'd say we're done.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.110
Ronnie, deadbeat.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.413
Steve, klepto.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.915
Kenny... drummer.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.584
Eventually,
I just had to face up

11:57.616 --> 12:00.386
to my destiny
as a loser magnet.

12:00.419 --> 12:02.721
Now it's strictly
get some, get gone.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.691
You can't trust guys.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.126
You can trust some guys.

12:07.159 --> 12:09.062
Really, I've
read about them.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.298
Yeah.
So, what about you?

12:11.331 --> 12:12.966
You mean like,
me and guys me?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.067
Mm-hmm.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.235
Not much to
tell these days.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.138
Yeah, but you
got to have stories.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.039
I mean, I've had
my share of losers,

12:20.072 --> 12:23.309
but you, you
boinked the undead.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.879
What was that like?

12:25.913 --> 12:29.783
Life with Angel's--
 was complicated.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.552
It's still a little hard
for me to talk about.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.886
Well, try.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.322
Look, Faith,

12:35.355 --> 12:37.724
all the Angel issues are
still kind of with me,

12:37.756 --> 12:39.725
so if you don't mind,
I'd rather not.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.494
Yeah.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.163
Yeah, whatever.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.965
You know what?

12:44.998 --> 12:46.432
We're oh for six tonight.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.668
Why don't we just
blow this off?

12:48.701 --> 12:50.903
I am kind of beat--

12:50.937 --> 12:52.905
But-but Shady Hill's
pretty close.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.174
I'll swing through it.
It's on my way anyway.

12:55.207 --> 12:58.077
Alone? I-I don't
know if I'd feel--

12:58.110 --> 12:59.511
I got Miss Priss
on my back now.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.514
I don't need
another baby-sitter.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.950
I'll holler if
I'm having any fun.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.817
Okay.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.153
Later.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.788
Thanks.

13:12.491 --> 13:15.562
(bird calling)

13:16.864 --> 13:19.866
(rustling, scraping)

13:19.899 --> 13:21.969
(loud thudding)

13:25.004 --> 13:28.575
Son of a bitch.
It's my lucky day.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.745
(grunting)

13:34.081 --> 13:35.782
(growling)

13:35.815 --> 13:37.250
(grunting)

13:38.817 --> 13:41.653
(low growling)

13:43.822 --> 13:45.325
(grunts, growls)

13:45.357 --> 13:47.961
(grunts, groans)

13:47.995 --> 13:50.163
(growling)

13:50.197 --> 13:52.231
(gasps)

13:53.832 --> 13:56.235
(angry chuffing)

13:57.836 --> 14:00.240
(panting, groans)

14:10.017 --> 14:12.184
(bird calling, panting)

14:13.385 --> 14:15.488
(sighs)

14:15.522 --> 14:17.657
Hey, Giles,
here's a nifty idea.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.893
Why don't I alleviate my guilt
by going out

14:19.927 --> 14:23.029
and getting myself
really, really killed?

14:26.865 --> 14:29.302
(rustling, scraping)

14:59.165 --> 15:01.900
*

15:46.846 --> 15:49.249
(Buffy exhales loudly)

15:49.282 --> 15:50.917
Uh.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.318
(panting)

15:52.351 --> 15:53.852
Oh, God.

15:53.885 --> 15:56.023
Buffy?
What am I doing?

15:56.056 --> 15:57.490
What are you doing?

15:57.524 --> 15:59.558
I don't know.
Shame on you!

16:00.726 --> 16:02.261
Oh, God, I...

16:02.294 --> 16:04.364
I don't even know
why I came back here.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.433
Uh, uh... it's
good you did.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.802
I think I have what
you're looking for.

16:14.841 --> 16:18.010
Great. Just, wherever
this was gift-wrapped,

16:18.044 --> 16:20.846
remind me not
to shop there.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.850
Glove of Myhnegon.

16:24.884 --> 16:28.020
The world's ugliest
fashion accessory.
Don't.

16:28.054 --> 16:32.024
Once you put it on, the
glove can never be removed.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.594
So... no touching.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.565
Kind of like us.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.834
You hold on to it. I'll...

16:41.868 --> 16:43.202
I'll tell Giles
in the morning.

16:43.235 --> 16:45.738
At least he'll be happy.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.311
Ah! Yes. There we are.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.546
There's a wood engraving. See?

16:53.580 --> 16:55.315
The Glove of Myhnegon.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.384
Yes, engraved by Father
Theodore of Wolsham.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.419
Yes.
Based, I believe,

17:00.452 --> 17:03.222
on very sketchy and
unreliable folk legends.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.892
The pictures are fun
to look at, Mr. Giles,

17:05.924 --> 17:08.528
but one really ought to read
the nice words, as well.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.930
(tea kettle whistling)

17:10.962 --> 17:14.067
Ah. Yes.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.035
Some tea, perhaps?

17:17.470 --> 17:20.240
I know that you must
find me tiresome,

17:20.271 --> 17:22.709
but it's insidious, really.

17:22.741 --> 17:25.044
A person slips up
on the little things,

17:25.077 --> 17:26.877
and soon everything's gone

17:26.913 --> 17:28.780
to hell in a
hand basket.

17:28.815 --> 17:32.050
For example,
Buffy, your slayer...

17:32.085 --> 17:34.386
Mrs. Post... I can assure you

17:34.421 --> 17:36.888
that Buffy is both
dedicated and industrious,

17:36.923 --> 17:39.025
and I am in complete
control of my slayer.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.426
(door rattles)

17:40.460 --> 17:42.894
Giles! We have a big problem.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.631
It's Buffy.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.268
Will you excuse us?

17:55.508 --> 17:57.876
(whispering)

17:57.910 --> 17:59.878
Would you like
some assistance?

17:59.912 --> 18:01.381
Thank you.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.250
That won't
be necessary.

18:06.318 --> 18:08.887
(birds singing

18:08.921 --> 18:10.289
(door opens,
footsteps approaching)

18:10.323 --> 18:11.758
BUFFY:
Lagos is

18:11.790 --> 18:15.060
out of luck.
I got the magic mitten thingy.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.164
What's with all

18:18.198 --> 18:19.865
the tragedy masks?

18:21.701 --> 18:24.203
Better take a seat, Buffy.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.777
What's going on?

18:33.011 --> 18:35.615
We know Angel is alive.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.285
Xander saw
you with him.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.186
It would appear that
you've been hiding him

18:40.220 --> 18:42.087
and that you lied to us.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.191
WILLOW:
Nobody's here to
blame you, Buffy.

18:44.223 --> 18:47.125
But this is serious.
You need help.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.096
It's not what you think.

18:50.128 --> 18:54.032
Hope not, because I think you're
harboring a vicious killer.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.801
WILLOW:
This isn't about
attacking Buffy.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.537
Remember, "I"
statements only.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.471
"I feel angry."
"I feel worried."

18:59.506 --> 19:00.873
CORDELIA:
Fine.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.107
Here's one.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.476
I feel worried.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.144
About me!

19:05.178 --> 19:07.547
Last time around, Angel barely
laid a hand on Buffy.

19:07.579 --> 19:09.781
He was way more interested
in killing her friends.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.617
But he's better now.
XANDER:
Better

19:11.651 --> 19:13.118
for how long, Buffy?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.787
I mean, did you even
think about that?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.823
What is this,
demons anonymous?

19:16.855 --> 19:19.192
I don't need
an intervention here.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.126
Oh, don't you?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.961
You must've known it was
wrong seeing Angel, or

19:22.994 --> 19:25.064
you wouldn't have hidden it
from all of us.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.236
I was going to tell you, I was.

19:29.269 --> 19:33.072
It was just that I...
I didn't know why he came back.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.074
I-I just wanted to wait.

19:35.106 --> 19:37.175
For what?
For Angel to go psycho again

19:37.210 --> 19:38.711
the next time
you give him a happy?

19:38.744 --> 19:41.146
I'm not going to...

19:41.180 --> 19:43.583
We're not together like that.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.751
But you were kissing him.

19:50.356 --> 19:54.426
You were spying on me?

19:54.461 --> 19:57.329
What gives you the right?

19:57.364 --> 19:58.830
CORDELIA:
What gives you the
right to suck face

19:58.865 --> 20:01.166
with your demon lover again?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.535
It was an accident.

20:02.568 --> 20:05.171
What, you just tripped
and fell on his lips?

20:05.203 --> 20:06.772
It was wrong, okay?
I know that,

20:06.806 --> 20:08.708
and I know
that it can't happen again.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.376
But you guys
have to believe me.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.444
I would never
put you in any danger.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.180
If I thought for a second that

20:14.212 --> 20:16.348
Angel was gonna hurt anyone...
XANDER:
You would stop him.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.885
Like you did last time
with Ms. Calendar.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.455
WILLOW:
Buffy,

20:23.490 --> 20:28.295
I feel that when it comes to
Angel, you can't see straight.

20:28.327 --> 20:32.298
And that's why we're-we're all
going to help you face this.

20:32.332 --> 20:36.201
But he's better now, I swear.
Look, you guys, he's the one

20:36.234 --> 20:37.604
that found
the Glove of Myhnegon.

20:37.636 --> 20:39.372
He's keeping it safe for us
in the mansion.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.972
Right!
Great plan.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.276
Leave tons of firepower
with a scary guy,

20:43.309 --> 20:45.478
and leave us
to clean up the mess.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.913
You would just love an excuse
to hurt him, wouldn't you?

20:47.947 --> 20:49.548
I don't need an excuse.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.384
I think lots of dead people
actually constitutes a reason.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.386
Right. This is all nobility.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.388
This has nothing to do
with jealousy.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.924
Hello? Miss
Not-Over-Yourself-Yet?

20:58.958 --> 21:01.259
Don't you start with me.
WILLOW:
Giles, no one's doing

21:01.294 --> 21:02.994
the "I" statements.
That's enough!

21:03.028 --> 21:05.230
Everybody.

21:05.263 --> 21:07.165
Now Buffy knows
our concerns,

21:07.199 --> 21:10.269
and her actions,
however ill-advised,

21:10.303 --> 21:12.904
can be understood.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.507
Our...

21:14.540 --> 21:16.675
priority right now is to
retrieve the Glove of Myhnegon

21:16.709 --> 21:18.144
and try to destroy it.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.213
Now, all of you,
back to your classes.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.957
(door opens)

21:30.990 --> 21:33.526
(door closes)

21:42.300 --> 21:45.471
Thanks for the bail in there.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.807
I know this is
a lot to absorb,

21:48.840 --> 21:51.611
but Angel did find the glove,
and that was a-a good...

21:51.644 --> 21:54.113
Be quiet.

21:54.145 --> 21:56.782
I won't remind you that
the fate of the world

21:56.816 --> 21:58.451
often lies with the slayer.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.286
What would be the point?

22:00.318 --> 22:03.556
Nor shall I remind you that
you've jeopardized the lives

22:03.589 --> 22:07.394
of all that you hold dear
by harboring a known murderer.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.797
But sadly, I
must remind you

22:10.829 --> 22:14.032
that Angel tortured me...

22:14.066 --> 22:18.069
for hours... for pleasure.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.574
You should have
told me he was alive.

22:21.607 --> 22:24.309
You didn't.

22:24.343 --> 22:28.714
You have no respect for me
or the job I perform.

22:50.936 --> 22:54.205
(knocking)

22:54.240 --> 22:57.276
A word of advice?

22:57.308 --> 23:00.011
Vampires rarely knock,
especially in daylight.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.380
Oh, right.

23:01.413 --> 23:03.348
(scoffs)

23:03.382 --> 23:05.785
So... this is your home.

23:05.817 --> 23:08.253
Yeah. The, uh, decorator
actually just left.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.355
Faith...

23:10.388 --> 23:12.625
do you know who
the Spartans were?

23:12.659 --> 23:16.394
Wild stab. A bunch
of guys from Spart?

23:16.429 --> 23:19.898
They were the fiercest warriors
known to Ancient Greece.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.268
And they lived in quarters
very much like these.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.369
Do you know why? Because

23:24.403 --> 23:27.373
a true fighter
needs nothing else.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.576
I'm going to be very hard
on you, Faith.

23:30.609 --> 23:31.978
I will not

23:32.010 --> 23:34.713
brook insolence or laziness.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.549
And I will not allow blunders
like last night's attack.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.486
You will probably hate me

23:39.519 --> 23:41.386
a great deal of the time.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.756
You think?
(siren blaring)

23:44.990 --> 23:47.393
But I will make you
a better slayer,

23:47.425 --> 23:50.395
and that will keep you alive.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.231
You have to trust
that I am right.

23:53.265 --> 23:57.002
God only knows what Mr. Giles
has been filling your head with.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.070
Giles is okay.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.406
His methods

24:01.440 --> 24:02.808
are unfathomable to me.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.811
I find him entirely
confounding.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.413
But that is not important.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.848
Let him have his games
and secret meetings.

24:09.882 --> 24:12.117
What meetings?

24:12.151 --> 24:15.121
Oh, I don't know. Something
with Buffy and her friends.

24:15.153 --> 24:17.455
Oh, right.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.857
I guess that doesn't include me.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.926
And why does he let her
socialize so much?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.630
It hardly seems...

24:23.663 --> 24:26.198
No matter.

24:27.733 --> 24:30.336
Would you like to do
some training?

24:30.368 --> 24:34.272
Training? As in kicking
and punching and stabbing?

24:34.306 --> 24:35.775
Yes, that's the idea.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.042
I'm your girl.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.444
(school bell rings)

24:39.478 --> 24:41.881
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

24:45.483 --> 24:48.319
Hey.
Hey.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.489
So on a scale
of one to a million,

24:50.522 --> 24:53.392
how much are you
hating me right now?
Zero.

24:53.424 --> 24:55.894
You were scared, you
kept a secret, you know?

24:55.927 --> 24:59.665
It's okay. I mean,
secrets aren't bad.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.366
You know, they're normal.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.734
They're better than normal.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.236
They're good.
Secrets are good.

25:04.269 --> 25:06.573
Must be a reason why
we keep 'em, right?

25:06.605 --> 25:09.040
Yeah, I guess.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.811
So, are you going to
The Bronze tonight,

25:12.845 --> 25:15.213
or, uh, are you
gonna sneak away

25:15.247 --> 25:17.482
for a not-so-secret
rendezvous with Angel?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.685
None of the above.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.587
I'm gonna try and kill
this Lagos guy.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.589
Peace offering to Giles.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.423
Well, Angel has the
glove now, right?

25:25.457 --> 25:27.093
Yup, but Lagos
doesn't know that.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.694
I figure sooner
or later, he's bound

25:28.728 --> 25:30.730
to show up at that crypt
looking for it.

25:30.762 --> 25:34.901
Ah, but instead, he finds
Buffy in a not-so-good mood?

25:34.933 --> 25:37.936
That's my brilliant plan.

25:37.970 --> 25:41.339
(rock music playing,
indistinct crowd chatter)

25:41.373 --> 25:43.776
You look pissed.

25:43.809 --> 25:47.278
Rough day.
Tell me about it.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.748
Rather just shoot.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.182
Don't think I don't know
what you and your pals

25:51.217 --> 25:53.118
were talking about
behind my back today.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.922
(strikes ball)
Yeah? What was that?

25:55.954 --> 25:58.625
More about this glove
deal than you're saying.

25:58.657 --> 26:01.027
The Glove of Myhnegon? Right.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.095
How'd you like a hit
of some real news?

26:03.128 --> 26:04.830
Angel's still alive.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.901
The vampire.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.202
Back in town.
Saw him myself.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.538
Toting the popular
and famous glove.

26:13.571 --> 26:14.973
Angel.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.407
(strikes ball)

26:16.442 --> 26:17.710
Guy like that,
with that kind of glove

26:17.743 --> 26:19.645
could kill
a whole mess of people.

26:19.679 --> 26:22.248
Said the same thing
to Buffy myself.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.750
Weird how she didn't seem
to care.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.317
Buffy knew he was alive.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.421
I can't believe her.
She says

26:29.454 --> 26:32.991
he's clean.
Yeah, well, I say we
can't afford to find out.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.560
I say I deal with
this problem right now.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.829
I say I slay.

26:37.864 --> 26:40.465
Can I come?

26:44.971 --> 26:47.173
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Giles?

26:47.205 --> 26:50.476
Yes. I do apologize for bringing
you in at this late hour.

26:50.509 --> 26:55.114
Please. A good watcher must be
awake and alert at all hours.

26:55.146 --> 26:58.116
Would you
like some tea?

26:58.150 --> 27:00.586
God, yes, please.

27:00.618 --> 27:02.954
I'm completely knackered.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.857
I spent the afternoon
training with Faith.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.694
She doesn't
lack for energy.
(laughs)

27:08.728 --> 27:11.462
She's your first
slayer, I take it?

27:11.497 --> 27:14.599
If you're questioning
my qualifications...

27:14.633 --> 27:16.035
No, I'm not.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.871
I have the utmost respect
for your methods...

27:18.904 --> 27:22.574
in my own American way.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.144
I also have the glove.

27:26.178 --> 27:30.182
Oh, not actually on me,
but, uh, I believe it's safe.

27:30.215 --> 27:32.117
It's at a... a mansion
on Crawford Street.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.386
A-a... a friend of Buffy's
is keeping it there.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.323
Well, we must get to it.

27:37.355 --> 27:39.025
Immediately.

27:39.057 --> 27:41.393
Hide it before
someone else finds it.

27:41.426 --> 27:43.295
Or better still, destroy it.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.297
Destroy it?

27:45.330 --> 27:47.398
Yes. Yes, I-I...

27:47.432 --> 27:51.703
I didn't think it could
be done either, but, uh...

27:51.738 --> 27:55.974
it involves transforming
fire into living flame and

27:56.008 --> 27:57.876
immolating the glove.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.478
It's complex, but, uh...

27:59.510 --> 28:03.382
I believe I have all
the necessary materials.

28:03.414 --> 28:06.919
Well, I must say, Mr. Giles...

28:06.952 --> 28:09.255
good show.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.257
(grunts)

28:11.289 --> 28:12.759
(gasps softly)

28:12.791 --> 28:14.660
Good show indeed.

28:14.692 --> 28:17.163
(grunts)

28:17.195 --> 28:19.597
(chair squeaking)

28:26.806 --> 28:29.040
(crickets chirping)

28:29.075 --> 28:32.177
Um, not to downplay
my own slaying abilities,

28:32.211 --> 28:35.247
which in some circles
are considered formidable,

28:35.280 --> 28:37.415
but shouldn't Faith be here?

28:37.449 --> 28:39.786
I tried calling,
but no one was home.

28:39.818 --> 28:42.054
Look, if you're feeling
any demon-o-phobia, please.

28:42.087 --> 28:44.056
Splitting is
totally an option.

28:44.089 --> 28:46.592
You're not the one
in trouble with Giles.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.559
That's true.
(bird calling)

28:48.594 --> 28:51.563
How long do you think he can
stay angry at me, anyway?

28:51.596 --> 28:53.699
The emotional marathon man?

28:53.731 --> 28:55.601
Yeah. I can't
really blame him.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.403
It's weird, though.

28:57.435 --> 29:01.472
Now that my secret...

29:01.507 --> 29:04.410
Angel-- it's all out
in the open...

29:04.442 --> 29:06.278
I feel better.

29:06.311 --> 29:10.449
Well, sure you do.
This big burden's been lifted.

29:10.481 --> 29:14.452
Keeping secrets
is a lot of work.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.989
One could
hypothetically imagine.

29:17.022 --> 29:19.424
You have no idea.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.727
None whatsoever.

29:21.759 --> 29:24.762
But... can I ask you
a question?

29:26.798 --> 29:30.469
When you were with Angel
and nobody knew about it,

29:30.501 --> 29:35.740
did that make it feel,
you know, sexier somehow?

29:35.773 --> 29:37.143
Not really.

29:37.175 --> 29:39.510
It's too much pressure.

29:39.545 --> 29:42.347
After a while,
it even makes the fun parts...

29:42.381 --> 29:43.915
not so fun.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.751
Huh.

29:46.785 --> 29:50.322
What makes you think all this
secret stuff is sexy, anyway?

29:50.355 --> 29:52.423
Nothing. Just wondering.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.425
Got to keep asking
the big old questions

29:54.460 --> 29:56.863
when you're blessed with this
girl's thirst for knowledge.

29:56.895 --> 30:01.032
And okay, there's something
I have to tell you.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.701
What?

30:04.036 --> 30:06.805
Okay. This will make me
feel better, right?

30:06.838 --> 30:08.773
(sighs)

30:08.807 --> 30:12.377
You know, I always
consider myself a good person.

30:12.411 --> 30:16.347
Floss, do my homework,
never cheat.

30:16.382 --> 30:19.151
But lately-- and please
don't judge me on this--

30:19.184 --> 30:23.555
but I want you to be the first
to know that-that...

30:23.588 --> 30:24.957
there's a demon behind you.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.192
(growling)

30:28.826 --> 30:30.729
(grunts)

30:30.761 --> 30:32.865
(demon growls, Buffy gasps)

30:32.898 --> 30:34.866
(demon growls,
Buffy groans)

30:35.834 --> 30:38.737
(grunting and growling)

30:38.769 --> 30:40.038
(Buffy gasps, growling)

30:40.072 --> 30:41.140
Ooh.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.741
(growls, Buffy groans)

30:43.775 --> 30:45.211
(growling)

30:45.243 --> 30:47.378
(grunting)

30:49.580 --> 30:51.116
Now we're talking.
(low growling)

30:52.284 --> 30:53.585
(grunts)

30:54.786 --> 30:57.222
Yes!

30:57.256 --> 30:59.691
(sighs, bird calling)

31:00.858 --> 31:03.229
Sorry about that.

31:03.261 --> 31:05.497
So, what were you saying?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.432
Oh, I...

31:07.465 --> 31:11.436
I opened my S.A.T. test
booklet five minutes early.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.240
Just doesn't seem
important now, does it?

31:15.273 --> 31:18.210
Your secret's safe with me.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.112
Come on.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.381
Let's go bring Giles
some happiness.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.353
Good old Sunnydale Library.

31:27.385 --> 31:30.888
Fully equipped with
reference books, file cards...

31:30.923 --> 31:32.891
and weapons.
Beauty.

31:32.924 --> 31:35.227
I call crossbow.
You got it.

31:38.896 --> 31:40.932
All right,
ready to go?
That I am.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.969
(male moaning)

31:43.001 --> 31:45.171
Wait.
What?

31:48.007 --> 31:49.942
Oh, my God, it's Giles!

31:49.976 --> 31:51.643
Giles, can you hear me?

31:51.676 --> 31:53.045
What the hell happened?

31:53.078 --> 31:54.445
Gee, let me guess.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.715
Stop. Hold.
Just think a minute.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.917
Yeah, I'm thinking. Thinking
Buffy's ex-meat did this.

31:59.951 --> 32:01.487
It's not Angel's style.

32:01.519 --> 32:03.489
The guy's a demon. How much
more proof do you need?

32:03.521 --> 32:05.090
Bite marks
would be nice.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.792
Yeah, I have a medical
emergency. Sunnydale High.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.728
Screw this
waiting crap.
Faith,

32:09.760 --> 32:11.730
if we leave, Giles could die.
Yeah, he's gonna have

32:11.762 --> 32:14.633
a whole lot of company
unless I do something permanent.
Wait!

32:14.665 --> 32:16.768
For what? You gonna grow a pair?

32:16.801 --> 32:19.238
You handle the baby-sit,
and I'm gonna kill Angel.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.472
(door closes)
Damn it!

32:22.840 --> 32:24.875
(speaking Latin)

32:45.530 --> 32:47.833
Giles is gonna be psyched

32:47.865 --> 32:49.867
that we showed up
stuffy old Mrs. Post.

32:49.901 --> 32:52.270
Oh, my God.
WOMAN:
Sunnydale Medical...

32:52.304 --> 32:54.440
What happened? Giles.
We have a Caucasian
male, mid-forties.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.541
Blunt object head trauma.
Notify ER we're bringing him in.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.009
What happened?
No time for this.

32:58.044 --> 33:01.846
Wait. Buffy, you must...

33:01.880 --> 33:04.516
must destroy the glove.
You want him to live?

33:04.549 --> 33:07.885
Get out of the way.
Use... living flame...

33:07.919 --> 33:09.055
WOMAN:
Move!

33:13.092 --> 33:16.127
What happened?

33:16.162 --> 33:18.064
Your boyfriend's not as cured
as you thought.

33:18.096 --> 33:21.366
What makes you think that Angel
had anything to do with this?

33:21.400 --> 33:22.901
We saw what you saw.

33:22.933 --> 33:26.172
So you just assume?
I didn't.

33:26.204 --> 33:27.939
Faith did.

33:30.241 --> 33:32.544
What did you tell her?

33:32.577 --> 33:34.079
Only what
everyone knows.

33:34.113 --> 33:37.415
She's a big girl.
Came to her own conclusions.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.817
How much of a head start
does she have?

33:39.851 --> 33:42.087
Ten minutes.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.990
Go through Giles'
research, figure out

33:46.023 --> 33:47.925
how to destroy the glove.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.963
Shut up and help me.

33:56.902 --> 33:58.737
What do you want?

33:58.769 --> 34:01.240
Gwen Post. Mr. Giles sent me.

34:01.272 --> 34:03.375
What for?

34:03.409 --> 34:05.943
To help you destroy the glove.
Is that the living flame?

34:07.145 --> 34:08.780
Yes.

34:08.813 --> 34:11.047
Look, I'm sorry to be so abrupt,

34:11.083 --> 34:13.619
but Lagos is on his way
here now.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.085
If you're performing
the ritual incorrectly,

34:15.121 --> 34:17.688
it will only make
the glove more powerful.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.425
All right.

34:20.458 --> 34:24.096
Good. Where is the glove?

34:24.130 --> 34:27.532
It's in the trunk.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.601
(grunts, thudding)

34:29.635 --> 34:31.969
That's what I love
about this town.

34:32.003 --> 34:34.106
Everyone's so helpful.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.681
Bugger! Bugger!

34:49.855 --> 34:53.090
Okay. That hurt.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.092
But it was supposed to kill you.

34:55.126 --> 34:56.728
If you'd been human,

34:56.762 --> 34:58.496
it would have.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.699
But...
I believe this your poison.

35:03.001 --> 35:05.103
(growls)

35:05.871 --> 35:08.440
(growls)

35:09.340 --> 35:10.942
(grunts)

35:12.344 --> 35:14.512
Mrs. Post!

35:14.545 --> 35:16.248
(growls)
I can't believe

35:16.282 --> 35:18.150
how much I'm gonna
kill you.
You're not

35:18.184 --> 35:19.918
getting that glove.
You want to bet?

35:19.951 --> 35:22.019
(grunting)

35:22.052 --> 35:24.822
(growling)
(grunting)

35:28.793 --> 35:30.996
(grunting)

35:35.400 --> 35:38.503
What? (grunting)

35:38.536 --> 35:40.038
XANDER:
Think we got it?
WILLOW: Well, it's either

35:40.070 --> 35:41.507
the catalyst for living flame,

35:41.539 --> 35:44.275
or just some
really smelly sand.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.378
We'll have to test this.
I'll double-check.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.347
What?

35:49.380 --> 35:51.516
I know what
the glove does.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.552
There's no time to test this.

36:00.157 --> 36:02.728
I can't let you
do it, Faith.
You're confused,

36:02.760 --> 36:04.195
Twinkie. Let me clear you up.

36:04.230 --> 36:07.164
Vampire, slayer, dead vampire.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.166
There's a lot that
you don't understand.

36:09.201 --> 36:11.168
MRS. POST:
Faith? She doesn't

36:11.202 --> 36:13.771
know. She's blinded by love.

36:14.905 --> 36:16.708
Faith, no.

36:16.742 --> 36:17.576
Trust me.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.211
Faith, we can
figure this out.

36:20.246 --> 36:23.215
(groaning)

36:23.248 --> 36:26.952
(grunting)

36:40.965 --> 36:43.568
(choking)

36:43.601 --> 36:46.737
(groaning)

36:48.407 --> 36:52.744
(grunting)

37:08.059 --> 37:11.161
(grunting)

37:13.831 --> 37:16.434
(yells, grunting)

37:20.005 --> 37:21.972
The glove-- it's
in the trunk.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.476
We'll get it.
Help Faith.

37:24.510 --> 37:30.181
(groaning)

37:37.523 --> 37:38.789
What are you...?

37:38.824 --> 37:41.626
Stop! Guys, listen!

37:41.659 --> 37:45.364
(grunting)

37:48.199 --> 37:51.336
(blows landing,
grunting continues)

37:54.340 --> 37:55.907
Finally.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.309
(blows landing,
grunting continues)

37:57.342 --> 37:58.809
(grunts)

38:00.378 --> 38:02.681
(grunting)

38:02.713 --> 38:05.282
(blows landing,
grunting continues)

38:13.291 --> 38:16.961
(speaks Gaelic)

38:16.994 --> 38:19.898
(thunder crackles and rumbles)

38:21.400 --> 38:22.833
(thunder crackling)

38:27.304 --> 38:29.507
What's going on?

38:29.541 --> 38:33.277
Faith, a word of advice.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.213
You're an idiot.

38:37.081 --> 38:38.516
(speaks Gaelic)

38:38.550 --> 38:43.054
(thunder crackling)

38:43.088 --> 38:46.257
(electrical hissing,
thunder crackling)

38:47.492 --> 38:48.860
(speaks Gaelic,
thunder crackling)

38:53.364 --> 38:55.733
(panting)

38:57.369 --> 38:59.036
(speaks Gaelic)

38:59.070 --> 39:03.708
(thunder crackling,
hissing, rumbling)

39:03.742 --> 39:05.643
Can you draw her fire?

39:05.677 --> 39:09.079
You bet I can.
Go do it.

39:17.288 --> 39:21.092
(speaks Gaelic,
explosive crackle)

39:21.126 --> 39:23.394
MRS. POST:
There's nothing you
can do to me now.

39:23.429 --> 39:25.931
I have the glove.
With the glove comes

39:25.963 --> 39:27.898
the power.
I'm getting that.

39:30.367 --> 39:31.936
(hissing)

39:31.969 --> 39:35.773
(thunder crackling, screaming)

39:35.806 --> 39:38.744
(screaming)

39:38.777 --> 39:41.378
(screaming, whooshing)

40:06.972 --> 40:09.574
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

40:09.608 --> 40:11.443
So there's no
more glove thingy?

40:11.476 --> 40:14.713
No. Little living flame,
little mesquite-- gone for good.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.380
Sounds like
we missed

40:16.414 --> 40:17.715
a lot of fun.
Then we're

40:17.748 --> 40:19.150
telling it wrong.
WILLOW:
What do you think

40:19.184 --> 40:21.318
Buffy and Angel
are gonna do?
XANDER: Boy,

40:21.351 --> 40:22.721
do I don't know.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.255
WILLOW:
Well, he saved

40:24.289 --> 40:26.123
me from a horrible
flamey death.

40:26.157 --> 40:27.559
That sort of makes
me like him again.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.159
XANDER:
Well, as long

40:29.193 --> 40:31.829
as she and Angel don't get
pelvic, we'll be okay, I guess.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.601
What are you guys talking about?

40:35.634 --> 40:39.103
Oddly enough,
your boyfriend. Again.

40:40.338 --> 40:43.074
He's not my boyfriend.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.677
Really, truly, he's...

40:46.945 --> 40:49.014
I don't know.

40:52.382 --> 40:54.085
Are we cool?

40:54.119 --> 40:56.454
Yeah.

40:56.487 --> 40:58.422
Just seeing
the two of you kissing

40:58.456 --> 41:01.693
after everything that happened,
I leaned toward the postal.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.864
But I trust you.

41:05.896 --> 41:07.666
I don't, just
for the record.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.300
(clears his throat)

41:09.333 --> 41:11.869
Let me guess.

41:11.902 --> 41:13.605
Gwendolyn Post, not a watcher?

41:13.639 --> 41:15.039
Yes, she was.

41:15.072 --> 41:17.442
She was, uh, kicked out
by the Council

41:17.474 --> 41:20.646
a couple of years ago
for misuses of Dark Power.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.447
They swear there was a memo.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.282
BUFFY:
Well, I better go.

41:24.315 --> 41:28.653
Little more damage control.

41:31.088 --> 41:32.891
WILLOW (sighs):
The whole

41:32.923 --> 41:35.193
Angel thing is so weird.

41:35.226 --> 41:39.831
Yes, well, we'll have to see
how that unfolds, won't we?

41:43.068 --> 41:44.635
MAN (on TV):
Yes, sir?

41:44.670 --> 41:47.204
Police officers. My
name's Friday. This is...

41:47.237 --> 41:48.806
(knocking)

41:48.840 --> 41:50.541
Come in.
(door opens)

41:50.576 --> 41:53.010
(TV plays indistinctly
in the background)

41:53.043 --> 41:55.313
Hey.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.815
(door closes)

41:57.849 --> 41:59.985
MAN (on TV):
Called the police
just a little while ago.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.086
Talked to a man down there.
I didn't get his name, though.

42:02.119 --> 42:03.688
The place looks nice.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.923
Yeah, it's real Spartan.

42:05.956 --> 42:09.027
MAN (on TV):
Can you show us where
they broke in, please?

42:11.896 --> 42:13.599
How are you?

42:13.632 --> 42:16.101
Five by five.

42:17.367 --> 42:19.369
I'll interpret that as good.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.708
Look, Gwendolyn Post,

42:23.742 --> 42:29.414
or whoever she may be,
had us all fooled, even Giles.

42:29.447 --> 42:31.382
Yeah, well,
you can't trust people.

42:31.416 --> 42:33.217
I should've learned that by now.

42:35.621 --> 42:38.623
I realize this is gonna sound
funny coming from someone

42:38.657 --> 42:42.226
that just spent a lot of time
kicking your face...

42:42.260 --> 42:44.461
but you can trust me.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.599
Is that right?

42:47.632 --> 42:50.300
I know I kept secrets,

42:50.335 --> 42:53.570
but I didn't have a choice.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.472
I'm on your side.

42:55.505 --> 42:56.875
I'm on my side,

42:56.907 --> 42:58.677
and that's enough.

42:59.945 --> 43:01.813
Not always.

43:01.847 --> 43:04.148
Is that it?

43:07.518 --> 43:08.954
Yeah, I guess.

43:08.987 --> 43:12.289
All right.
Well, then, I'll see you.

43:12.322 --> 43:14.693
(TV plays indistinctly
in the background)

43:20.699 --> 43:21.967
Uh, Buffy?

43:23.601 --> 43:25.771
Yeah?

43:29.474 --> 43:31.009
Nothing.

44:44.949 --> 44:47.418
Grr. Argh.
