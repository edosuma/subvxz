18:12.566 --> 18:13.897
Get down!

18:22.810 --> 18:26.473
Wait. That big weapon thing
was a light switch?

18:33.687 --> 18:37.020
- What are you grinning about?
- One word: Souvenir.

18:37.191 --> 18:39.352
Two words: Gorilla lice.

18:39.526 --> 18:41.050
Huh? Oh, man.

[GROANS]

That's the last of the collars?

18:48.502 --> 18:49.764
[GRUNTS]

18:49.937 --> 18:52.929
And I can count on you to keep
the other animals out of trouble?

18:53.107 --> 18:54.438
[GRUNTS]

18:54.608 --> 18:58.635
Good. I'll be back for a visit. I promise.

19:00.814 --> 19:03.476
I think I'll call him Mr. Tawny.

19:03.650 --> 19:06.380
SUPERBOY: Rest of the pack has gone.
What are you still doing here?

19:06.553 --> 19:08.953
- I think he wants to stay with you.
- Can I keep him?

19:09.123 --> 19:11.591
Heh. First the Sphere, now this beast?

19:11.759 --> 19:14.319
Dude, you sure make a habit
of collecting strays.

19:14.495 --> 19:16.986
Maybe because he's such a stray himself.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.388
<i>Aren't you?</i>

19:18.932 --> 19:22.231
<i>SUPERBOY:
M'gann, I'm sorry. I was just worried.</i>

19:22.970 --> 19:24.699
<i>MISS MARTIAN:
And that's sweet, Conner.</i>

19:24.872 --> 19:28.171
<i>But on a mission,
I'm your teammate, not your girlfriend.</i>

19:28.342 --> 19:31.004
<i>- Agreed?
SUPERBOY: Yeah.</i>

19:31.178 --> 19:35.205
Well, he's gonna need a name.
Uh, how's about Krypto?

19:35.382 --> 19:36.406
[SNARLS]

19:36.583 --> 19:39.518
- Pass.
- Besides, isn't that taken?

19:41.822 --> 19:45.758
Look, I need to know.
Why did you keep the mole intel a secret?

19:51.732 --> 19:54.223
The source of the tip was Sportsmaster.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.995
What? You can't trust him.

19:57.171 --> 20:00.038
I do not. It seemed possible, even likely...

20:00.207 --> 20:03.335
...that he was attempting
to divide the team with false information.

20:03.510 --> 20:06.604
And given how this mission went,
he nearly succeeded.

20:06.780 --> 20:09.010
But you had to consider it might be true.

20:09.183 --> 20:11.447
Yes. As leader, I did.

20:11.618 --> 20:14.348
In which case,
I did not wish to alert the traitor.

20:15.255 --> 20:18.622
Hate to say it, but makes sense.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.885
I am still prepared to step down.

20:21.528 --> 20:25.225
All in favor of keeping Aqualad as leader.

20:30.637 --> 20:33.128
Guess it's unanimous.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.902
- See you tomorrow.
- You're not coming back with us?

20:37.077 --> 20:38.806
No. Gotta fly.

20:42.783 --> 20:46.116
- So, what are you gonna call him?
- What's wrong with Wolf?

20:46.286 --> 20:49.778
KID FLASH:
Generic but acceptable.

[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING
AND CHEERING ON TV]

21:05.138 --> 21:08.665
- Well, boy, how'd it go?
- Ah, it was so cool.

21:08.842 --> 21:11.504
The team's way more fun to hang out with
than the league.

21:11.678 --> 21:14.579
And they go on these covert ops missions
that rock.

21:14.748 --> 21:17.444
And I got nabbed by the Brain
and I met this tiger and...

21:17.618 --> 21:21.281
Okay, okay. I'm glad you had fun, sport,
but it's getting pretty late.

21:21.455 --> 21:25.585
- Brush your teeth and hit the hay.
- Okay, okay, I'm going.

21:27.761 --> 21:29.786
Aren't you forgetting something?

Nah. Just seeing
if you were paying attention.
