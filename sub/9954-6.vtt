00:01.419 --> 00:02.784
Pre vious/y on "Ha ven". ..

00:02.920 --> 00:04.785
Why are you in such a hurry
to have me leave Haven?

00:04.922 --> 00:06.833
Tell me what the big secret is.

00:06.966 --> 00:08.831
Come on, Duke.
I know you have one.

00:08.968 --> 00:09.753
Don't touch me!

00:09.886 --> 00:13.128
And lam doing you a favor
by not sharing it.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.255
I can't touch anything.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.722
I don't want to live like this anymore.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.761
17. That's how many people
have died because of the troubles

00:21.898 --> 00:23.138
since I shot Howard,

00:23.274 --> 00:25.981
and I think about them
with every breath I take.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.475
The troubles haven't ended.

00:27.612 --> 00:29.477
Killing me is the only way now.

00:29.614 --> 00:30.649
Please, Audrey.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.066
I'm not killing anyone.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.064
My name is Lexie.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.283
You know I'm not her, right?

00:35.411 --> 00:37.652
You're a completely different person,
and I don't want you.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.324
I want you to be Audrey again.

00:39.457 --> 00:42.324
You and her, you had something.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.791
lt's complicated.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.410
You seem pretty ballsy to me.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.083
You jumped out of that barn
and went down in that basement.

00:48.216 --> 00:51.128
I guess I'm just having a hard time
believing that you were scared.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.921
Isn't that right, Audrey?

00:53.054 --> 00:54.385
Damn it, Duke.

00:56.224 --> 00:59.057
Yeah. It's me.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.513
—DU KE: Coffee?
—Please.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.855
Are you testing me?

01:48.985 --> 01:50.521
I don't like milk.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.026
It's not milk.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.282
I know you're Audrey.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.365
Mm, Baileys.

01:58.494 --> 01:59.859
I know you're Duke.

02:01.539 --> 02:03.575
Okay, let me ask you a question.

02:03.708 --> 02:04.697
You land in that field,

02:04.834 --> 02:07.576
you realize that if anyone
figures out that you're Audrey,

02:07.712 --> 02:09.452
that they'll —— they'll kill Nathan.

02:09.588 --> 02:14.628
So you decide to pretend to be
the person you were in the barn.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.216
—Lexie?
—I like it.

02:16.345 --> 02:20.258
—|t rhymes with "sexy."
—Yes, it does.

02:20.391 --> 02:21.847
So here's my question though.

02:21.976 --> 02:27.516
I mean, how do you do Lexie
when you're really Audrey?

02:27.648 --> 02:30.685
We're gonna need a hell of a lot
more than Baileys to answer that.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.525
You see, like that.
That's a really Lexie thing to say.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.363
l'm Audrey, all right?
I really am.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.073
The same Audrey that helps
people with troubles,

02:40.202 --> 02:44.286
and the same Audrey
who went to Colorado with you.

02:46.125 --> 02:50.869
But unlike Sarah or Lucy,
I remember Lexie, okay?

02:51.005 --> 02:57.217
Like a dream, or remembering
some kind of fantasy of yourself.

03:01.599 --> 03:04.090
You can't tell him that I'm Audrey.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.764
He wants to end the troubles,
and he has that plan, and he's...

03:09.357 --> 03:12.224
Just promise me
that you won't tell him.

03:16.572 --> 03:19.860
—I promise.
—Thank you.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.903
But...

03:22.912 --> 03:24.573
He's gonna figure it out.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.820
Why does he have to do that?

03:25.956 --> 03:28.447
Because when you care
about somebody, you can't ——

03:30.294 --> 03:32.080
They can't ——

03:32.213 --> 03:34.329
Look, I'm just telling you,
he's gonna figure it out.

03:34.465 --> 03:35.580
You need to stay away from him.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.922
That's kind of impossible.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.383
The Guard wants us to work together,
and that was your idea.

03:39.512 --> 03:42.470
Look, for today, you just keep him
from figuring out that you're Audrey,

03:42.598 --> 03:44.429
and I'll keep The Guard
from killing him.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.097
ln here.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.395
Hey, Lexie.

03:52.942 --> 03:55.354
Uh, hey.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.192
I brought, uh, coffee.

03:57.321 --> 04:00.984
I don't know what you like,
so, um...

04:01.117 --> 04:03.654
Spiked. I like it spiked.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.781
Oh, right.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.870
—At 10:00 am.
—Yeah.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.376
—You know, next time, I'll...
—Yeah.

04:11.502 --> 04:13.834
We got a call,
so it's a possible trouble.

04:13.963 --> 04:16.500
— We should go.
—You know what? I can't.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.172
I can't.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.925
Why not?

04:22.054 --> 04:24.716
Well, apparently,
when your Audrey disappeared,

04:24.849 --> 04:27.056
the department,
they cleared all of her paper work,

04:27.184 --> 04:30.972
so now, I got to go back down there
and just, like, fill it all out again.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.389
—I don't know. Um...
—I do.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.436
lgots to get paid, all right?

04:36.569 --> 04:38.560
Especially if I'm gonna be a cop.

04:38.696 --> 04:41.062
She gots to get paid
so she can pay the rent.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.278
That too.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.231
Not runnin' a charity here.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.575
I'll just, you know,
help you from the command post.

04:46.704 --> 04:49.446
I'll say things like,
"10—4," and, "Copy that,"

04:49.582 --> 04:50.992
and, like, eat donuts and stuff.

04:51.125 --> 04:54.037
Nathan, just let her go
to the cop shop, you know?

04:54.170 --> 04:55.580
Yeah.

04:56.714 --> 04:58.420
You and I will take the call.

04:58.549 --> 04:59.755
What are you doing?

04:59.884 --> 05:02.876
Look, The Guard's not gonna be
happy you're working without her.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.752
Dwight's in Cleave's Mills
cleaning up some mess.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.049
You're...

05:06.182 --> 05:09.970
You're gonna need somebody
to watch your back here.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.101
Thanks.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.854
Okay.

05:22.948 --> 05:23.903
[Sighs]

05:32.416 --> 05:33.872
[Whistles]

05:34.001 --> 05:35.286
Look at this place.

05:35.419 --> 05:38.877
Duke can decorate?
Who knew?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.463
Duke would be pissed
if he knew I brought you here.

05:41.592 --> 05:42.707
Don't tell him.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.960
Okay, I won't.

05:49.517 --> 05:53.977
Wade, you know what happens
if you touch me, right?

05:54.104 --> 05:55.560
Yes.

05:55.731 --> 05:59.269
But I'm willing to give it a try.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.442
Not my kind of pain.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.899
Then what are we doing here?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.949
I needed to know
that I could trust you.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.029
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

06:13.749 --> 06:17.207
It's the reason your brother
wants you out of Haven.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.373
You're special, Wade.

06:21.590 --> 06:26.630
Your father gave you and Duke
a powerful gift.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.468
You could end the troubles.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.342
Me?

06:31.475 --> 06:33.340
I thought it was Audrey...

06:33.477 --> 06:35.058
Or Lexie,
or whatever the hell she is.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.929
No, she's actually
more the problem, really.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.140
You could be the solution.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.233
Would you like that?

06:45.114 --> 06:46.695
Very much.

06:46.824 --> 06:49.031
Then I need you to help me
with a few things.

06:49.159 --> 06:53.277
And if you do,
I'll show you your real power.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.824
Deal?

06:56.417 --> 06:57.998
Deal.

06:58.127 --> 07:01.164
l have my intern
helping your uniform,

07:01.297 --> 07:02.161
and no more cops,

07:02.298 --> 07:05.131
or you're gonna turn this trouble
into a roadside attraction.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.339
And that never helps.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.674
Where's Lucassi?

07:07.803 --> 07:10.510
He split in the middle of the night.
Took the neighbor's cats with him.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.713
—He finally snapped.
—Hey, you know what?

07:12.850 --> 07:16.684
After being in this town,
I took a job at Club Med lxtapa.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.178
They regretted the "all you can drink"
option, I'll tell you.

07:20.733 --> 07:23.645
It's Gloria.
She worked with my dad.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.857
Yep.
They took me out of mothballs.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.228
I like mothballs compared to this.

with a dozen muffins

07:35.497 --> 07:37.237
and gets rigor mortis.

07:37.374 --> 07:41.834
Yes, normally that happens
after death, but in Haven...

07:41.962 --> 07:42.826
Look at that.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.376
It's like the actin and myosin
in his cells went bonkers.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.051
Bonkers?

07:48.177 --> 07:50.259
Yeah, it's a medical term.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.095
You're a cop?

07:54.224 --> 07:55.555
Consultant.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.217
I bought weed from you.

07:58.354 --> 08:00.094
Yeah, I was...

08:01.732 --> 08:03.268
...undercover.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.185
Mm—hmm.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.730
Well, as soon as intern
can do this job alone,

08:06.862 --> 08:09.524
I'm putting my house on the market.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.863
I know her.

08:10.991 --> 08:11.855
That's Vickie.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.232
lntern's troubled.

08:13.369 --> 08:15.781
She's the one who does
the voodoo drawings.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.074
Yeah, I keep her away
from the paper work.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.447
Anyway, we'll take Mr. Hughes.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.074
Just go with,
"stroke, then he hit his head."

08:22.711 --> 08:24.417
Oh, I like her.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.541
The witnesses are all saying
the same thing.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.633
Victim just kept staring at his phone.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.969
Staring at his phone? Why?

08:34.098 --> 08:36.259
Like he was getting
text messages he didn't like.

08:36.809 --> 08:37.924
We got a troubled person

08:38.060 --> 08:39.971
who can send text messages
that do this?

08:41.063 --> 08:42.553
Haven in the digital age.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.100
Let's find that phone.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.603
Jordan.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.397
Hello, Vince.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.145
What are you doing
in this part of town?

08:51.281 --> 08:52.817
Shoe shopping.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.611
—Jordan.
—Really, Vince?

08:54.743 --> 08:56.825
There's a part of Haven so bad,
I can't go?

08:56.954 --> 08:58.069
Jordan, stop!

09:01.417 --> 09:03.703
I know you want the troubles to end,

09:03.836 --> 09:06.418
but there are forces at play here
you don't understand.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.627
And you do?

09:07.756 --> 09:09.166
Not completely, no.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.039
But in my considerable experience,

09:11.176 --> 09:16.842
I think waiting for Lexie
to fall in love with Nathan, and then...

09:17.975 --> 09:19.431
Her killing him?

09:19.560 --> 09:20.800
Yes.

09:20.936 --> 09:24.269
Her killing him is our best plan.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.729
Not the one you're hatching.

09:25.858 --> 09:28.065
—Excuse me?
—Oh, please.

09:28.193 --> 09:31.276
You're duping Wade Crocker
into activating his family trouble.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.646
You think all the troubles
are Lexie's trouble,

09:33.782 --> 09:36.364
and if Wade kills Lexie,
all the troubles will end.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.654
Well, you're wrong.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.652
Vince, do you realize
what I've been through?

09:40.789 --> 09:42.825
Those people lied to me, used me,

09:42.958 --> 09:45.540
and I fell in love with Nathan.

09:45.669 --> 09:49.708
All I want is for this madness to end.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.465
I know.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.003
And I'm doing everything
in my power to end them.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.169
—Do you believe that?
—Yes.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.345
But I can't wait anymore.

10:34.343 --> 10:35.378
Thanks for your time.

the victim was carrying these.

Still Waters School.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.258
—What's that?
—|t's a new private school.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.258
Some parents approached me

10:45.395 --> 10:48.558
and said if my son Dylan was clean,
he could go there.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.351
—Clean?
—No troubles.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.439
Told them we're not interested.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.401

at Haven Junior High.

in 1/2 hour.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.813

about this school.

Okay.

Schools excluding troubled kids.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.790
That's a new one.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.455
Well, the troubles
used to last a couple years,

11:10.587 --> 11:12.168
then people would get
a couple decades off.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.236
I'm sorry, sir. Department
needs me at a crime scene.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.405
You can finish your statement
at the station.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.288
Right.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.120
It's probably one
of "those" crime scenes.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.240
This town is ridiculous!

11:49.376 --> 11:52.288
You can't just take off
in the middle of my statement!

11:52.421 --> 11:55.254
Oh, it's because —— it's because
of the troubled people, isn't it?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.838
I'm sick and tired...

12:00.345 --> 12:02.677
Okay. Thanks for your help.

12:04.766 --> 12:05.846
According to Maine Cellular,

12:05.976 --> 12:08.137
this phone wasn't connected
to anyone at the time of death.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.259
That's weird.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.227
All right, get it back
to the station, Tater.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.187
See what you can pull off
the SIM card.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.308
Keep it off.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.651
Later, Tater.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.612
I talked to some moms.
Seth was getting supplies.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.447
Still Waters School's
having a meeting

12:22.576 --> 12:24.817
to get parents to commit
to sending their kids there.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.784
And commit to dividing up the town.

12:26.914 --> 12:31.658
So someone killed Seth
to try to stop this meeting?

12:32.336 --> 12:33.792
A bit excessive.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.036
Remember the rev?

12:35.172 --> 12:37.709
He wanted all the troubled dead.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.004
Tater, get goin'.

12:43.347 --> 12:44.962
Tater!

12:45.098 --> 12:47.510
What's he doin'?

12:49.853 --> 12:51.844
Tater, what are you...

12:58.820 --> 13:00.356
The phone.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.313
I thought it was off.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.859
How did he get a text message?

13:03.992 --> 13:06.028
You see where he's staring?

13:06.161 --> 13:07.662
That thing gets texts, too.

13:07.788 --> 13:11.030
So you're saying
that whoever's doing this

13:11.166 --> 13:13.373
sent him a text on purpose?

13:14.086 --> 13:15.622
This was a hit on a cop?

13:15.754 --> 13:17.210
Maybe.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.005
Call this in, use your radio,

13:21.134 --> 13:22.715
get everyone to stop
using their phones.

13:22.844 --> 13:23.549
Get a name and number

13:23.679 --> 13:26.091
for everyone with a visual
on this location, okay?

13:26.223 --> 13:29.181
Then meet us
at Still Waters School.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.971
Phone.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.093
My phone.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.345
Don't answer it.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.392
Don't. What are you...

13:37.567 --> 13:39.307
It's not a text.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.651
—Fishing buddy.
—Really?

13:41.780 --> 13:43.987
Well, import—export fishing.

13:44.116 --> 13:46.778
Look, whatever.
I'll meet you at the car.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.901
This trouble, it just got Tater.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.277
Tater was killed?

13:50.414 --> 13:51.745
Yeah, it's a weird one.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.579
Okay, where are you?
I'm coming down there.

13:53.709 --> 13:57.793
No. No, look, Audrey,
just help us from the station, okay?

13:57.921 --> 13:59.752
Find out about
this Still Waters School,

13:59.881 --> 14:01.963
or I'm telling you,
Nathan's gonna figure out it's you.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.083
I can't avoid him forever,
all right, Duke?

14:04.219 --> 14:06.881
Besides, what about the deal
that you made with The Guard?

14:07.014 --> 14:09.801
Look, since when doesn't
The Guard want me dead?

14:09.933 --> 14:13.300
Look, I still think
this is our very best bad plan.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.848
Give me the names.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.643
Okay, the first dead guy
was Seth Hughes, 25.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.561
We think he worked
for Still Waters School.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.398
Uh, hi.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.615
I've been told I need a permit
to put on a fireworks show.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.158
Here, here, all this side,

14:34.291 --> 14:37.783
here, here, here,
and right there.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.126
—Need a pen?
—Nope, got one. Thanks.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.496
So I can just fill this out here?

14:43.592 --> 14:45.457
Just find a desk.

14:45.594 --> 14:46.834
Thank you.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.311
[Phone beeps off]

15:05.238 --> 15:07.820
I don't think
you should be in here, cowboy.

15:07.949 --> 15:11.487
Um, sorry. Just looking
for a place to write.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.075
Waiting area.

15:13.205 --> 15:14.991
Right, okay. Sure.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.159
You're Lexie, is that right?

15:17.626 --> 15:20.288
l'm Wade Crocker,
Duke's brother.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.162
gﬁié'é:
;—?3;:~>’:

15:24.091 --> 15:26.548
Well, anyway, okay, waiting.

15:26.676 --> 15:27.711
Waiting area.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.551
Waiting area, yeah.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.812
Think we should call Lexie
and tell her to meet us here?

15:40.941 --> 15:43.148
No. She's probably
already at the station

15:43.276 --> 15:44.231
halfway through her paper work.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.647
Let's just let her
get her bearings, you know?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.566
Besides, this...
I don't know.

15:48.698 --> 15:52.031
This trouble's pretty dangerous
for a newbie, don't you think?

15:53.495 --> 15:56.157
I heard Jennifer
went to pick up her stuff.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.541
Well, I guess.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.703
What's up with you and her?

16:02.045 --> 16:03.546
What's up with you asking?

16:03.672 --> 16:06.584
| just —— I remember
what you said that day

16:06.716 --> 16:09.378
outside the barn about Audrey.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.296
l was kind of hoping
you'd forget about that.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.224
You said you loved her, Duke.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.563
You said you loved Audrey.

16:24.317 --> 16:24.942
[Sighs]

16:25.068 --> 16:26.729
Yeah.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.694
It's okay.

16:31.491 --> 16:36.076
Just want to make sure you keep
an eye on Lexie when I'm gone.

16:41.418 --> 16:44.160
—Nathan, listen...
—Hey, Audrey's gone.

16:44.296 --> 16:45.957
We both lost her.

16:46.089 --> 16:50.082
Whoever she is now, | just want
to know you'll take care of her.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.259
I'm gonna end the troubles, Duke.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.759
I know you will.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.640
Come on.
Let's go talk to this principal.

17:05.275 --> 17:06.936
So Seth didn't have a stroke?

17:07.068 --> 17:08.274
It was a trouble.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.439
Someone else's.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.608
Exactly why we're doing
what we're doing.

17:12.741 --> 17:13.730
And what are you doing?

17:13.867 --> 17:16.074
Protecting my children,
my family.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.819
Yes, I want my kids to go
to a trouble—free school.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.286
I don't apologize for that.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.412
How many people know about this?

17:24.544 --> 17:25.408
I had to get the word out.

17:25.545 --> 17:29.288
In fact, they should
be arriving soon, so...

17:33.762 --> 17:37.095
—That's really weird.
—What?

17:37.224 --> 17:38.088
What is?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.386
Is it a text?

17:40.518 --> 17:43.806
No. See that?
My phone...

17:45.148 --> 17:48.811
Computer, my watch.

17:48.944 --> 17:50.309
No. What about 'em?

17:50.445 --> 17:52.936
They're all counting down
together in unison.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.317
I don't see it.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.156
It's as clear as day.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.821
Eight seconds.

18:00.956 --> 18:05.950
Five, four, three, two, one.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.836
Don't touch him.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.513
I wasn't planning on it.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.428
Okay, honey.
Just keep me updated.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.681
Oh, my God.
Another one?

18:25.814 --> 18:26.599
Yeah.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.723
I'm gonna need you
posted at this door.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.441
Send any parents
who come to the meeting home.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.696
Might need to stay a while.

18:33.822 --> 18:34.732
Okay.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.820
Dylan just said
his doubles match can't start.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.531
The scoreboard just broke.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.321
—What's wrong with it?
—I don't know.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.613
He thinks it's fine,

18:41.746 --> 18:43.532
but the coach says
it just keeps counting down.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.034
Clock's ticking.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.916
Let's go.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.213
—Coach.
—Budget cuts.

18:58.346 --> 18:59.335
This is what you get.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.723
You know, I had to fix
our video camera

19:00.849 --> 19:01.759
with my own money.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.267
Coach, what's wrong
with the scoreboard?

19:03.393 --> 19:05.759
Well, it won't stop counting down.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.386
Look at it. See?
Just counts down.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.602
Uh, look at my phone.

19:11.735 --> 19:14.021
Is my phone counting down, too,
like the scoreboard?

19:16.448 --> 19:17.233
Yeah.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.401
What do you know
about Still Waters School?

19:19.534 --> 19:20.944
Are they in our division?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.277
No.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.579
How much time is left?

19:27.792 --> 19:30.625
9:14, 9:13.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.121
The video camera now.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.043
How about here?

19:37.260 --> 19:39.546
| see it everywhere.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.964
What's going on?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.112
You're making a terrible mistake.

20:03.244 --> 20:06.111
If I end the troubles,
people might disagree.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.748
Jordan.

20:15.173 --> 20:19.166
In 1981, the troubles
came back in June.

20:19.302 --> 20:23.136
I remember because my friend and l were umpiring a
little league game

20:23.264 --> 20:27.803
and the pitcher
threw his arm out, literally.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.473
It was a God—awful summer.

20:30.605 --> 20:31.845
Lucy hadn't showed up yet,

20:31.981 --> 20:35.144
and the troubles
were happening unabated.

20:35.276 --> 20:39.645
My wife's family
had a horrific trouble.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.692
Painful, brutal.

20:41.825 --> 20:44.692
And l was terrified that my wife
was gonna get it, too,

20:44.828 --> 20:47.285
so I tried to protect her
the only way I could,

20:47.414 --> 20:50.531
with my friend, Simon Crocker.

20:52.001 --> 20:55.334
l activated Simon
with my own blood.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.419
You?

20:57.549 --> 20:59.164
Yes.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.336
Nobody knows that.

21:01.469 --> 21:05.382
| asked him to kill my father—in—law,

21:05.515 --> 21:07.426
and he did what I asked.

21:09.185 --> 21:14.521
Years later, with Lucy's help,
I had to kill Simon Crocker.

21:16.359 --> 21:19.897
I didn't want my wife to be troubled,
to become a monster,

21:20.029 --> 21:22.236
but what I did?

21:22.365 --> 21:24.856
It was worse than the troubles.

21:26.995 --> 21:29.987
I became the monster.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.843
Sure Duke isn't coming back?

21:42.969 --> 21:44.925
l lojacked his car.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.716
There's some amazing technology
out there.

21:47.849 --> 21:52.138
And as requested,
two camera pens, audio—equipped,

21:52.270 --> 21:54.431
one on Nathan's desk,
the other in the bullpen.

21:54.564 --> 21:57.806
—|mpressive.
—It is.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.024
But watching?

22:00.153 --> 22:03.270
This is dull.

22:04.282 --> 22:08.571
I do know
how we could kill some time.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.407
You're persistent.

22:12.582 --> 22:15.119
You think it'll work?

22:16.711 --> 22:18.918
Let's try.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.513
How you doing?

22:30.642 --> 22:32.678
Good.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.675
Feel any pain?

22:34.812 --> 22:36.768
Good.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.724
Well, hello, Lexie.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.443
—Oh, no.
—Wade, listen to me.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.399
I want to do this,

22:48.535 --> 22:51.277
and if we end the troubles,
we won't need rubber gloves.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.491
Unless we want them.

22:54.624 --> 22:59.459
But right now,
we have to focus.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.123
You better be worth it.

23:01.548 --> 23:06.463
And you have to tell me
howl can end the troubles.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.550
All right.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.341
You've earned this.

23:10.473 --> 23:12.714
You are special, Wade.

23:13.851 --> 23:18.060
If you get the blood
of a troubled person on you,

23:18.189 --> 23:20.931
it changes you.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.476
You get stronger.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.022
Much stronger.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.110
How do | get troubled blood on me?

23:29.242 --> 23:30.698
It's up to you, really.

23:30.827 --> 23:31.816
Duke did this?

23:33.037 --> 23:34.117
Oh, yes.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.033
MAN: Excuse me. / was robbed.
/ need to report a crime.

23:36.165 --> 23:36.699
/ need you to help me.

23:36.833 --> 23:37.913
NATHAN: I'm sorry.
[7/ be right with you.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.249
MAN: What? This is ridiculous.
Why do / pay my taxes?

23:40.378 --> 23:41.788
Do / have to be troubled
to get some help?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.582
Calm down, please.
Just wait in the waiting room.

23:43.715 --> 23:45.706
LEXIE: Three victims?
Why'd it take you so long to call?

23:45.842 --> 23:47.628
It happened really fast.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.502
Okay, so l—l put away all the clocks,
just like you asked.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.629
No, not just clocks.
Anything with a digital screen.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.301
They all count down.

23:54.434 --> 23:57.551
Okay, so you're thinking that
if he can't see the countdown then...

23:57.687 --> 23:58.472
Maybe it won't happen.

23:58.605 --> 24:02.348
All the other victims,
they —— they —— they saw it happen.

24:02.483 --> 24:05.350
Look, he only has,
like, a minute left.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.520
35 seconds.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.735
The thermometer.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.233
Wait, you can see it?

24:13.369 --> 24:15.030
—Yeah.
—Great.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.745
Then you and the lucky guy
counting down are the only ones.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.998
Have a seat.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.465
You don't see anything
counting down now, right?

24:26.591 --> 24:29.424
No, no, but on the way here
I saw everything.

24:29.552 --> 24:31.383
The gas pump, the bank sign.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.298
Actually, I kind of liked
the gas pump.

24:33.431 --> 24:34.841
Much better than $4.99.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.098
But nothing now, right?

24:38.645 --> 24:40.055
No, nothing n...

24:40.188 --> 24:41.553
[Coach gasps]

24:55.912 --> 24:58.949
Um, we got a problem.

24:59.082 --> 25:00.367
You mean, other than
the petrified man?

25:00.500 --> 25:02.741
Yeah, we got
a much bigger problem.

25:02.877 --> 25:03.866
Can anyone see this?

25:04.003 --> 25:05.379
—See what?
—This.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.245
—No.
—|t's counting down.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.213
Can you see it?

25:10.051 --> 25:11.257
Me.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.092
I can see it.

25:14.430 --> 25:15.419
It means you're next.

25:23.940 --> 25:24.554
How much time?

25:24.691 --> 25:27.103
15:27, 26.

25:27.235 --> 25:31.069
Okay, so your countdown started
the exact second that his stopped.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.109
So they go in some sort of order.

25:34.242 --> 25:36.107
—They're all about 15 minutes.
—|t's like a queue.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.451
It's like when one ends,
the next one begins.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.444
So I joined the queue
right after coach.

25:41.582 --> 25:42.833
—Why?
—Okay.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.120
Where —— where have we been
since —— since we met the coach?

25:45.253 --> 25:48.711
The school, the tennis office,
streets, parking lot, here.

25:49.382 --> 25:50.918
I really wish
you were Audrey right now.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.256
She's good at this stuff.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.758
Damn. That's a bad deal.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.552
This town needs me
to end the troubles.

26:00.685 --> 26:05.224
Can you rewind this?
I think I saw something.

26:07.984 --> 26:10.475
Stop.
Who is that?

26:11.112 --> 26:13.945
I heard them talking.
He was robbed.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.029
Hit play.

26:16.159 --> 26:18.525
l was robbed!
/ need to get my stuff back!

26:18.661 --> 26:20.276
-Lock—up. Do you mind?
-No, wait!

26:20.413 --> 26:23.155
Look, there.
You see the clock?

26:23.291 --> 26:25.532
He's the troubled guy.

26:25.668 --> 26:26.532
lt's him.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.876
Look, if this was an attack
on Still Waters School,

26:29.005 --> 26:31.212
then why go after the coach
from Haven Junior High School?

26:31.340 --> 26:31.874
Why you?

26:32.008 --> 26:34.249
Maybe it's not an attack
on the school directly.

26:34.385 --> 26:35.170
In the car on the way over here,

26:35.303 --> 26:36.383
where else did the coach
say he's been?

26:36.512 --> 26:39.504
Parent meetings, locker room,
pick up the video camera.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.016
Did you say video camera?

26:41.142 --> 26:43.133
Yeah, he —— he said he had
to get it repaired to ——

26:43.269 --> 26:45.385
to film the kids practicing
their —— their —— their serves, or...

26:45.521 --> 26:48.228
Lexie, it's not a camera or a phone.
We've been down that road.

26:48.357 --> 26:51.349
No, Paul Krebs Electronics.
He was robbed this morning.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.351
That's what Tater
was investigating, right?

26:54.197 --> 26:55.562
Krebs was in here earlier.

26:55.698 --> 26:58.030
He was filing a report
when you guys got back.

26:58.159 --> 26:59.524
—What, that guy?
—Yes.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.911
Paul Krebs!

27:06.000 --> 27:07.831
You call Tatum "Tater"?

27:09.712 --> 27:13.751
Krebs said that he had to count
to 1,000 when the robber escaped,

27:13.883 --> 27:16.875
so that would be,
like, what, 15 minutes,

27:17.011 --> 27:21.505
that he was supposed to sit there
just motionless, all right?

27:21.641 --> 27:24.758
That —— that's the kind of thing
that starts a trouble, right?

27:26.270 --> 27:29.228
He's setting a 15—minute
time clock on people

27:29.357 --> 27:31.564
that leaves them motionless
when it ends.

27:32.735 --> 27:35.568
That's the kind of thing
that causes a trouble?

27:41.536 --> 27:43.618
Yeah.

27:46.749 --> 27:48.034
Audrey?

27:49.335 --> 27:51.792
Yes.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.627
Parker?

27:53.756 --> 27:54.586
Yeah.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.922
—Parker.
—Yeah.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.755
It's always been me, Nathan.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.633
Yeah.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.302
Why didn't you tell me?

28:05.434 --> 28:09.973
Because people wanted me
to shoot you if I was Audrey.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.937
Yeah, but when we were alone.

28:12.066 --> 28:14.648
You wanted me to shoot you.

28:14.777 --> 28:16.233
He's gone.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.447
You knew?

28:22.577 --> 28:25.569
Okay, we've got eight minutes
to find Paul Krebs.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.616
I figured it out.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.488
When?

28:29.625 --> 28:30.956
The first day.

28:31.878 --> 28:34.164
—What...
—Nathan, we don't have time for this.

28:34.297 --> 28:35.662
And you didn't say anything to me?

28:35.798 --> 28:37.299
After everything?

28:37.425 --> 28:39.131
l was trying to keep you alive.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.626
I don't want you to keep me alive.
I want to end the troubles.

28:41.762 --> 28:42.751
You should want that, too.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.550
You're right. I should.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.559
Pisses me off that I don't.

28:47.685 --> 28:49.550
Paul's Electronics
is on Camp Street.

28:49.687 --> 28:50.597
We got to go.

28:51.689 --> 28:54.601
—We need to go.
—Yeah.

28:57.361 --> 28:59.693
—Paul?
—Paul?

28:59.822 --> 29:02.313
—Paul?
—He's not back there.

29:03.075 --> 29:06.112
You won't find him.
I made sure of that.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.202
Jordan, we're running out of time.

29:09.332 --> 29:10.993
I know, Audrey.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.495
I heard everything.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.209
We bugged the office.

29:15.338 --> 29:17.670
And I had a whole new plan
to end the troubles,

29:17.798 --> 29:19.584
but now that I know
that you're Audrey,

29:19.717 --> 29:23.426
we can go back to the original plan,
the sure thing.

29:23.554 --> 29:25.340
Kill him.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.724
No.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.643
No, and I'm not Audrey.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.687
Stop lying to me!

29:45.993 --> 29:49.076
Jordan, you need
to tell us where he is.

29:49.205 --> 29:53.039
Shoot me,
and you'll never find him.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.580
Don't you get it?

29:57.713 --> 30:00.625
What's Nathan have left?
Four minutes?

30:00.758 --> 30:03.875
At least make it count
for something, and kill him.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.044
End the troubles.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.563
Four minutes.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.314
Audrey.

30:29.036 --> 30:33.575
We can end the troubles forever,
right now.

30:37.169 --> 30:37.624
Hey.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.460
I know what Agent Howard said,
all right?

30:40.589 --> 30:43.581
But we've spent our lives
doing impossible things.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.793
Now we just have to do another.

30:48.514 --> 30:51.802
I'm not ending the troubles
by killing you.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.799
Paul.

30:53.936 --> 30:55.676
Paul Krebs!

30:56.605 --> 30:58.220
Where's the troubled guy?

30:58.357 --> 31:00.188
Wade, get out of here.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.566
You're helping her?

31:02.695 --> 31:04.026
Actually, she's helping me.

31:04.155 --> 31:06.191
Showing me
the Crocker family secret.

31:06.323 --> 31:06.903
—Wade, you don't want that.
—Yes, I do.

31:08.284 --> 31:10.650
Wade, things have changed.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.826
Things have changed?

31:12.955 --> 31:15.617
Troubled people giving me power?
That's changed?

31:15.750 --> 31:17.991
l have a better way
to end the troubles now.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.493
Okay, listen,
he's got to be here.

31:20.629 --> 31:21.914
Stop, or I'll shoot.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.458
No, you won't, Jordan.

31:23.591 --> 31:25.798
You're not gonna
shoot me or Nathan,

31:25.926 --> 31:27.791
because then,
you don't get what you want.

31:27.928 --> 31:30.089
So put the damn gun down!

31:41.233 --> 31:42.609
He's here!

31:43.944 --> 31:45.150
Paul?

31:45.279 --> 31:46.610
Paul.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.195
Oh.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.198
Where are you going?

31:51.327 --> 31:52.942
To get some of his blood.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.070
To get what you've had all along.

31:55.539 --> 31:58.121
No, you're not.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.496
Damn you, Duke.

32:02.296 --> 32:05.163
Yeah, I think that happened
a long time ago.

32:05.299 --> 32:07.790
I am trying to protect you, Wade.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.508
Wade!

32:14.517 --> 32:16.633
—You have a problem.
—You think?

32:16.769 --> 32:18.634
| get ripped off,
the cops ignore me,

32:18.771 --> 32:20.727
and then this crazy bitch
takes me hostage,

32:20.856 --> 32:22.232
and she really hurts.

32:22.358 --> 32:24.223
Listen, you're troubled.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.475
What?

32:25.611 --> 32:28.318
You keep putting a countdown clock
on people.

32:28.447 --> 32:32.440
When it counts down to zero,
they harden, and they ——

32:32.576 --> 32:34.737
they die, okay?

32:34.870 --> 32:37.202
He has —— he has two minutes.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.738
And if you keep that clock running,

32:39.875 --> 32:42.082
she'll have to kill him,
and we're all cured.

32:42.211 --> 32:43.417
Shut up, Jordan!

32:43.546 --> 32:44.786
No more troubles.

32:44.922 --> 32:46.958
—Do you want to get shot?
—Duke.

32:47.091 --> 32:48.251
Nathan, she's trying to kill you.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.750
Jordan just wants the troubles
to end. So do |.

32:53.013 --> 32:57.222
This isn't Jordan's fault,
so don't —— don't shoot her.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.277
Listen, after you were robbed,
those guys from the school,

33:17.413 --> 33:18.778
they wanted
their electronics back, right?

33:18.914 --> 33:20.290
Coach wanted his camera.

33:20.416 --> 33:22.247
I ignored you
when you tried to report it.

33:22.376 --> 33:23.582
You've been putting
a countdown clock

33:23.711 --> 33:25.622
on anyone who's slowing you down.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.370
But why?
Slowing you down for what?

33:28.507 --> 33:30.122
You said you were robbed,
but I don't see anything missing.

33:30.259 --> 33:31.749
All right?
What did they take?

33:32.344 --> 33:33.129
A bracelet.

33:33.262 --> 33:36.720
l was gonna give it
as a birthday present today.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.305
50 seconds, Parker.

33:38.434 --> 33:39.389
Was it for her?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.634
—Yes. Ellie.
—|s that your girlfriend?

33:41.770 --> 33:44.056
No. She's just a friend.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.646
But you want her to be more.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.733
—Don't you?
—That's it.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.069
—You need to call her.
—No, no.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.655
I can't call her on her birthday,
and have nothing but me. No.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.489
Be honest.
Tell her how you feel.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.280
30 seconds, Parker.
We're out of time.

33:58.412 --> 33:59.993
You...

34:00.122 --> 34:01.987
Call her now.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.172
—15 seconds.
—Okay, shh.

34:09.298 --> 34:10.333
Audrey, this is our last chance!

34:10.466 --> 34:11.797
—Ask her to coffee, okay?
—I can't.

34:11.926 --> 34:14.008
Yes, you can.
Just talk to her.

34:16.055 --> 34:18.762
-Hello?
—Happy Birthday.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.007
Oh, hi, Paul.

34:21.143 --> 34:25.011
l was wondering
if you wanted to go for coffee?

34:26.106 --> 34:27.846
Oh.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.143
Um...

34:31.153 --> 34:32.984
Well...

34:34.114 --> 34:36.150
Well, that would be really nice, Paul.

34:37.076 --> 34:40.534
-When?
—It stopped.

34:40.663 --> 34:42.745
How about 10 minutes?
Black House Cafe?

34:43.415 --> 34:46.953
Uh, yeah, l'll —— I'll be there.

34:49.046 --> 34:51.002
I'm going for coffee.

35:02.351 --> 35:05.718
Thank you so much, you guys.
I'm gonna lock up, okay?

35:10.150 --> 35:11.560
Wade!

35:19.785 --> 35:20.695
[Gasping]

35:32.381 --> 35:34.588
I'll call him an ambulance.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.542
[Moaning]

35:37.678 --> 35:38.383
It's okay.

35:38.512 --> 35:39.547
Drop the knife.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.765
Damn it, Wade.
You shouldn't have done that.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.429
You're not the only special
Crocker anymore.

35:46.562 --> 35:48.553
—That was stupid.
—Why?

35:48.689 --> 35:51.351
Because now I can
end the troubles, too?

35:51.817 --> 35:53.478
Wade.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.315
Hey.

35:54.445 --> 35:56.060
—Wait.
—Out of the way!

35:56.196 --> 35:58.403
Nathan, wait.

35:58.532 --> 35:59.442
Let me go after him.

35:59.575 --> 36:00.985
He just stabbed that guy.

36:01.118 --> 36:04.736
This is my fault.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

36:04.872 --> 36:08.456
I'm asking you. Please.

36:10.794 --> 36:12.409
Let me deal with Wade.

36:17.051 --> 36:19.133
Wade!

36:40.407 --> 36:42.489
Wade is activated?

36:42.618 --> 36:45.906
I tried to stop it, but...

36:47.706 --> 36:50.163
You were right, Vince.

36:50.292 --> 36:52.408
I've been letting this town...

36:54.713 --> 36:57.250
...make me into a monster.

37:02.137 --> 37:03.923
What happened to your wife?

37:04.056 --> 37:06.593
Found out what I did,

37:06.725 --> 37:10.468
hated me for it, left me.

37:10.604 --> 37:13.095
Some couples
are never meant to be.

37:14.066 --> 37:17.308
And some couples are.

37:18.612 --> 37:19.818
What?

37:20.739 --> 37:22.855
Nothing.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.731
I'm just...

37:26.954 --> 37:28.569
I'm leaving Haven.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.864
I need a new start.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.723
The doctor said
that Paul's gonna make it.

37:53.564 --> 37:56.055
Hopefully, Ellie visits him
in the hospital.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.443
Yeah, just the fact that he made
that phone call to her, you know?

37:58.569 --> 38:00.935
I think that'll keep
his trouble at bay.

38:01.071 --> 38:03.107
That was great.

38:03.240 --> 38:07.825
It's like a phone company
commercial in Haven.

38:07.953 --> 38:11.571
Yeah. Reach out
and unfreeze someone.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.536
Sorry.

38:16.545 --> 38:20.629
See, that's the kind of terrible joke
that I missed, Parker.

38:20.757 --> 38:23.214
Yeah, well, I know my audience.

38:25.679 --> 38:27.089
I'm glad you're back.

38:30.601 --> 38:32.182
VVhy?

38:33.604 --> 38:34.889
Hm?

38:36.023 --> 38:38.309
Why are you glad
to have me back?

38:41.612 --> 38:43.022
What do you mean?

38:44.406 --> 38:46.522
Never mind.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.330
Are you mad at me?

38:52.456 --> 38:54.913
—No.
—You're mad at me.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.416
You told Paul to be honest
and you're lying to me?

38:59.421 --> 39:01.332
You've been lying to me.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.628
Because I made a decision
to go into the barn

39:05.761 --> 39:07.843
and end the troubles, Nathan.

39:07.971 --> 39:10.804
And then you shot Agent Howard.
You screwed it all up.

39:10.933 --> 39:13.891
Audrey, I couldn't let you go.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.475
Right. Exactly.

39:15.604 --> 39:18.812
And now l have to be the one
to kill you.

39:18.941 --> 39:20.977
l have to let you go.

39:21.109 --> 39:22.645
And I won't do it.

39:23.612 --> 39:24.977
I'm sorry, I ——

39:25.113 --> 39:27.399
I made a deal with The Guard.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.899
They're not gonna find out who I am.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.276
This will never be their decision.

39:32.412 --> 39:34.494
Okay, but I thought
maybe it was mine.

39:34.623 --> 39:36.659
Well, you're wrong, Nathan.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.250
Because”.

39:40.379 --> 39:42.210
I love you.

39:45.884 --> 39:49.126
So that makes this my decision.

40:06.780 --> 40:11.991
Since I'm leaving Haven tomorrow,
I —— | just wanted to say good—bye.

40:12.119 --> 40:13.984
Oh.

40:14.121 --> 40:18.205
I thought maybe you wanted
to celebrate my new talent.

40:19.668 --> 40:21.408
Maybe?

40:24.464 --> 40:27.547
I don't think that would be
a good idea now.

40:27.676 --> 40:29.007
No?

40:31.263 --> 40:32.548
Okay.

40:35.100 --> 40:39.013
So how do lend all the troubles?

40:40.188 --> 40:42.395
l was wrong.

40:42.524 --> 40:44.890
I don't think you can.

40:45.027 --> 40:46.187
Really?

40:49.615 --> 40:51.025
You don't want to tell me.

40:51.158 --> 40:53.820
My plan wouldn't have worked.

40:53.952 --> 40:57.490
It was a mistake,
and I'm sorry, Wade.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.033
No, it's okay.

40:59.166 --> 41:00.497
Really.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.617
You shouldn't need to apologize.

41:03.462 --> 41:06.499
Actually, I'm the one
that should be thanking you.

41:07.507 --> 41:10.374
When that troubled blood
landed on me,

41:10.510 --> 41:15.550
it felt like molten lava
coursing through my veins.

41:16.975 --> 41:21.514
For the first time,
I realized why I'm here.

41:21.647 --> 41:25.014
It was incredible.

41:31.615 --> 41:35.654
No! You bastard!

41:38.664 --> 41:40.120
What was the plan?

41:40.248 --> 41:41.658
No! No!

41:42.709 --> 41:44.620
Tell me. What was the plan?

41:44.753 --> 41:48.587
No! I'm done being a monster.

41:48.715 --> 41:51.957
Yeah, that is what you are.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.884
No!

41:57.724 --> 41:59.225
Aah!
