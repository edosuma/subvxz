And you said your answer,
and I said my answer.

1:14:13.699 --> 1:14:15.032
And then, we said, "Oh, okay."
Like, so--

1:14:15.192 --> 1:14:17.285

day--every day, you switch up,

1:14:17.369 --> 1:14:18.786
like, how you feel,
so I'm just like--

1:14:18.871 --> 1:14:20.788

And what's wrong with that?

1:14:20.873 --> 1:14:22.198

to the conclusion.

every [bleep] day,

1:14:28.121 --> 1:14:30.631
especially in this situation.
- Right. I understand that.

1:14:30.790 --> 1:14:32.467
But I don't understand
why should we sleep--

1:14:32.626 --> 1:14:33.968

in separate rooms right now.

help anything; that only hurts.

How does it hurt?
Tell me how it hurts.

1:14:40.467 --> 1:14:42.635

going great for us, so, like,

1:14:42.719 --> 1:14:44.812

Why are we switching it up now?
