<i> I have an</i>

10:17.417 --> 10:18.950
That needs to be escorted
over the border.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.018
What is it?

10:20.020 --> 10:20.952
Well, that's none
of your concern.

10:21.021 --> 10:21.986
I just need you to ensure

10:22.055 --> 10:23.988
That no one sees the
contents of this boxcar.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.123
Not the staff,

10:25.192 --> 10:26.957
Nor the customs inspectors.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.361
How am I supposed
to do that?

10:31.498 --> 10:33.865
This railroad was
built on imagination,

10:33.867 --> 10:36.000
Innovation, and audacity.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.201
Channel that.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.403
Be creative.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.138
Well I'm nothing
if not creative.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.140
You're nothing if
not an edwards.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.842

11:00.827 --> 11:02.760
<i> The last stop</i>

11:02.829 --> 11:03.961
You might want
to head off.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.097
The train is about to leave.
Thank you very much.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.975

another ten minutes.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.983
<i> There's always a spot for</i>

11:25.118 --> 11:28.052
(chuckles) I already got
edwards and his spies

11:28.121 --> 11:29.854

11:29.890 --> 11:32.924
You think I want miss queenie
angling for what's left?

11:32.926 --> 11:34.425
Things are different now.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.861
Me and queenie are partners.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.496

Glenford:
<i> Zeke!</i>

11:45.772 --> 11:46.871
What happened?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.007
Picked up the drop
from clarence,

11:49.142 --> 11:50.007
Some guy jumped me
on the way back.

11:50.143 --> 11:50.975
Who?

11:51.111 --> 11:52.510
I never seen him before.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.811

11:55.115 --> 11:56.080
Did he get my money?

11:56.082 --> 11:56.915
Yeah man.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.082
Okay, get him on the train.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.383
Get him on the train.

11:59.453 --> 12:03.688

<i> I gotta head into town</i>

12:06.793 --> 12:08.826
Junior:
<i> I'll catch the next</i>
<i> train back to montreal.</i>

12:10.097 --> 12:11.896
I gotta find out what
happened before word gets out.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.430
Cover my car?

12:14.301 --> 12:16.501
Ain't you
forgetting something?

12:16.570 --> 12:17.835
Shit. Marlene.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.103
I'll square things
with marlene later-

12:19.106 --> 12:20.371
Well wait. Hey, hey.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.572
You think you should be
heading down there alone?

12:21.641 --> 12:23.841
I mean, look at what the
hell they did to otis's face.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.109
That is nothing compared
to what'll happen

12:25.112 --> 12:27.245
If I don't get
queenie her money.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.199
Hey, what you doing
around these parts?

12:49.236 --> 12:52.537
I thought the
train left at eleven.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.539
I thought it was
time to check in,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.474
See how business
was doin'.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.009
Clarence:
<i> Hmm? Ah, pbshtt,</i>

12:58.078 --> 13:00.478
<i> Well, numbers is bringing</i>

13:04.484 --> 13:05.549

13:11.157 --> 13:12.824
He got jumped

13:14.160 --> 13:15.459
You seen anybody
hanging around?

13:15.495 --> 13:16.894
Hmmm.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.896
Did the drop this week
same as I did last week,

13:19.032 --> 13:20.031
And the week before that.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.298
All right.

13:41.755 --> 13:42.554

13:46.193 --> 13:47.191
<i> No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

13:47.194 --> 13:48.793
You were-you were fine,

13:48.795 --> 13:50.094
You were fine
taking from my boy

13:50.230 --> 13:51.095
<i> And now you're</i>

13:55.168 --> 13:57.936
Listen, I lost everything
to the spanish flu, man.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.004
I had to go see this loan
man by the name of bolton.

14:00.139 --> 14:02.073
I ain't asking you
for your sob stories!

14:02.208 --> 14:03.007
I'm asking for my

14:03.142 --> 14:04.008
It's gone!

14:04.143 --> 14:05.609
He took it all!

14:05.645 --> 14:07.144
He said-he said he's "changing
the terms of our agreement".

14:07.180 --> 14:08.179
He said-
-you lying to me?

14:08.181 --> 14:09.480
No!
-<i> You fucking lying to me?</i>

14:09.482 --> 14:10.915
<i> You want me to break</i>
<i> your fucking boy's hand?</i>

14:10.984 --> 14:12.350
Oh come on, junior, man.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.285

And then that dollar ends
up in his pocket, marlene.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.401
Come on!

19:30.470 --> 19:31.602
He is a black man

19:31.638 --> 19:33.870
Who wants to do
right by his people,

19:33.907 --> 19:37.141
Not just have them holding their
hands out to the white man.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.414
So that's what you
think I'm doing?

19:48.354 --> 19:52.223
All I meant was that is why
I'm taking my clinic to him.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.160
We can barely go to
the white hospitals.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.097
Certainly can't
get a job at one.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.702
We have to take
care of ourselves.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.371
That's all I'm tryin'
to do too, marlene.

Hey, I thought you were
on the last run in?

20:35.401 --> 20:38.402

<i> Isn't that edwards boy?</i>

20:44.611 --> 20:45.876
Yeah, don't know
what he's doin',

20:45.878 --> 20:47.377
But he does it
at every stop.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.948

20:54.587 --> 20:56.087

20:56.222 --> 20:58.489
Maybe he's working the
train for extra money.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.958
Had a run in with him at
stardust a couple of weeks ago.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.161
That boy might be the
worst gambler I ever seen.

cleaned up straight away.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.589

allowed gambling on his trains.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.658
Ah, it's just a
friendly game, sir.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.460

this goes no further.

21:41.167 --> 21:43.801

a half outside of montreal.

"friendly little game",

21:47.673 --> 21:48.839
As you say.
