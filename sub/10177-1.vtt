00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching on 123Movies.to

00:36.720 --> 00:39.280
- Morning, Mister.
- Morning, young man.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.275
Who are you trying to impress?

00:46.400 --> 00:48.231
Tell that boy
to put the paper in the door.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.789
Or next time
it'll be a big bottle.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.839
In the nose, out the mouth.
In the mouth, out the nose.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.157
Don't breathe. Now breathe in.
And hold it in!

01:08.640 --> 01:12.030
Confuse that body, rattle it!
Make it crazy!

01:12.480 --> 01:14.948
Hold it, hold it.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.512
Ziya, Hayrettin, Kadir.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.194
Stand like this
or your spleen will blow up.

01:24.240 --> 01:27.710
Look at Saffet the teacher there.
What a saint.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.235
See? He's rounded up
the poor duckies again...

01:30.440 --> 01:33.591
And got them Eid outfits.
Bless him, the dear.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.188
But he knows all
about walking on the road.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.715
Hey, teacher!

01:38.640 --> 01:39.755
Ýsmail Abi.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.794
You're hogging the road
like cattle.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.350
Am I supposed to
whip you into line?

01:45.720 --> 01:47.711
And you say you've seen the city.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.714
There's only one Sivas, son.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.553
Anything you want to learn
is here.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.518
- Where are you going?
- To the village.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.638
OK, that's on our way.
Bye then. See you.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.877
Move over there.

02:15.480 --> 02:19.553
It's the same every Eid, Fikret.
You oversleep, we have pray outside.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.153
My roots needed a fix, Ýsmail Abi.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.753
Here, brethren.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.993
Have some shame,
it's a holy morning.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.636
Don't drive me to sin please.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.719
This fridge box is foreign.
I'm not prostrating myself on it.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.275
God forgive you!

02:53.480 --> 02:57.473
Çetin Abi, spare me today of all days.
Turn it over, you won't see the logo.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.911
Fikret abi, hear that?
He's talking logos.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.948
Ýsmail Abi, excuse me
while I shit on him.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.398
Not a single mat left, huh?

03:08.080 --> 03:09.513
Çetin, Çetin!

03:10.280 --> 03:12.669
- What's up?
- I'm fine, praise God. You?

03:12.960 --> 03:15.076
I was preaching
before you bust in, Çetin.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.033
On the rules and virtues
of Eid prayers.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.196
You always do the same sermon.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.716
So what?
He figured we hadn't got it.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.555
Çetin, enough! Sit down.
You whine every Eid. How many now?

03:28.040 --> 03:29.189
- Three!
- And you're cocky.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.349
Never!

03:30.840 --> 03:33.877
Don't get me wrong, imam.
You collected a ton of alms.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.356
OK, call it my sin.
But where did those alms go?

03:37.640 --> 03:40.791
On air-con,
on wall-to-wall carpets.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.479
Zip it, teacher!

03:42.840 --> 03:46.230
You're like a punch-hungry wimp
trying to break up a fight.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.312
But you're talking to the imam.
Manners, please!

03:49.800 --> 03:54.078
Honoured imam, it's come to my notice
that you have no spare mats.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.352
My worthy brothers must pray
on whatever they find.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.552
Fikret Abi had 'for sale'
printed on his forehead last Eid.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.478
He got the ads page.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.713
3 beds, lounge, new kitchen/bath
in Þarkýþla. Monthly fees 80 lira.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.429
For your attention!

04:08.600 --> 04:10.591
Enough, Çetin!
OK, I'm starting.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.916
Get chanting, Hüseyin.
Quick!

04:27.840 --> 04:31.310
Give whatever you can.
God will reward you in heaven.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.596
Eid blessings, Abi.
Have some cologne.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.717
Give whatever you can.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.075
Eid blessings, Abi.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.469
Friend.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.798
This is from five of us,
but we need change.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.234
But this is change!

04:45.800 --> 04:47.028
I'll keep it then.

04:48.520 --> 04:51.114
Give what you can,
help out the mosque.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.476
Give what you can.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.393
Help out the mosque.
Give what you can.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.353
This sucks.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.956
Even the alms box is
a foreign bleach box, huh?

05:07.080 --> 05:09.548
God forgive you!
Çetin Abi, don't bother.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.079
Get a receipt, brothers.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.515
Get a receipt.
No one's getting a receipt.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.797
Çetin, why not make peace
with your village imam?

05:18.120 --> 05:20.998
Go to Eid prayers there
if you don't like this mosque.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.594
Anyway it's less crowded there.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.393
I'm not at war,
just making a stand.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.396
Beat it! Tell your dad
to pay his debt from 2004.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.068
And he celebrates Eid!

05:39.360 --> 05:40.475
Eid blessings!

05:47.160 --> 05:48.912
Put this in your pocket.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.313
Wake up, Nazmi Amca.
I'm Fikret, the gas man.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.039
He's got old, Çeto.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.435
- What are you sacrificing?
- A bit of skirt!

05:56.920 --> 06:00.754
C'mon, it's the end of Ramadan,
not the Feast of the Sacrifice.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.719
God, he's got old.

06:02.880 --> 06:06.077
Chill, Fikret Abi. He's a big giver.
Here, Nazmi Amca. Eid blessings!

06:06.280 --> 06:07.429
Eid blessings!

06:09.400 --> 06:10.435
- Tank?
- Dad!

06:10.640 --> 06:12.073
Son!

06:12.520 --> 06:14.875
Tank!
What are you doing here?

06:15.160 --> 06:18.072
- Nothing wrong, huh?
- No, dad. Thought I'd surprise you.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.636
Come here then
and let me hug you. Son!

06:28.800 --> 06:32.475
Saffet, when did you sneak in?
I'm stuck on Tank's lap here.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.999
I'll swap if you like, Fikret Abi.
I'm his godfather, I'm OK.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.189
What does that mean?

06:38.320 --> 06:41.198
- Marriage is a no-no.
- What does that mean?

06:41.360 --> 06:44.909
Nazmi Amca, when did you sneak in?
Where are you going?

06:45.120 --> 06:46.712
Is Yýldýzeli on the way?

06:48.640 --> 06:53.589
Tank, I once spent a fortune to get
half as zoned out as Nazmi Amca.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.756
Here's the fare for five people.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.348
He's paying for us too.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.433
What is this, Nazmi Amca?
Shame on you!

07:01.800 --> 07:05.315
Forget fares. Come with us
and have a good breakfast at ours.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.992
I'll drop you off later.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.312
<i>It was my first time back in years.</i>

07:10.880 --> 07:14.077
<i>It feels incredible
when someone goes wild just to see you.</i>

07:15.240 --> 07:20.394
<i>What's going on, Mum? It's only me.
What’s so amazing about that, Dad?</i>

07:21.080 --> 07:24.470
<i>My precious boy!
How I'd die for you!</i>

07:24.600 --> 07:27.751
<i>You know, there are people here
who love you more than anyone else.</i>

07:28.000 --> 07:29.274
You're all maniacs!

07:29.480 --> 07:32.358
<i>It's not the place you miss
but the people in it.</i>

07:32.640 --> 07:34.551
OK, don't hit my boy.
He's my boy.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.517
Go on in, dear.
You must be hungry.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.031
<i>You're treated to the best food
in the best place.</i>

07:40.240 --> 07:42.310
<i>Just because you've come home.</i>

07:42.440 --> 07:45.671
<i>People race around
to make you feel at home.</i>

07:45.840 --> 07:47.398
Whose son are you?

07:49.160 --> 07:50.195
Huh?

07:52.120 --> 07:53.189
Ahmet's.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.998
That father of yours...

07:55.640 --> 07:57.870
He was a nasty piece of scum.

07:58.760 --> 07:59.795
The check!

08:06.000 --> 08:09.879
<i>Missing these people you love
suddenly becomes missing the city.</i>

08:11.400 --> 08:15.552
<i>And I'd arrived that day to give
these lovely people a little surprise.</i>

08:21.880 --> 08:24.758
Look, son.
I'm not the narrow-minded type, OK?

08:24.960 --> 08:28.316
Hell no, I've an open mind.
I'll say that.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.836
Marry if you like.
I'd never interfere. Why should I?

08:32.200 --> 08:35.828
But I need some background.
Who is this girl, who's her family?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.991
Marika and I worked for the same firm
in Latvia. Then...

08:39.120 --> 08:40.109
I don't want to know!

08:40.320 --> 08:44.029
Why this thing fora foreign bride?
Are all Sivas girls blighted?

08:44.480 --> 08:46.948
Look, it's his life.
What's it to us?

08:47.280 --> 08:50.750
What do you mean?
I can't even say the girl's name!

08:51.160 --> 08:54.072
She's our bride, not some stranger.
For heaven’s sake!

08:54.360 --> 08:56.715
So listen.
Where was Latvia a district of?

08:57.280 --> 08:58.713
3 hours by air from Istanbul.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.589
Capital, Riga. Maritime climate,
humid, harsh winters.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.158
Ýsmail Abi,
is the girl Muslim?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.878
What's it to you
if she is or not, Fikret?

09:10.480 --> 09:13.597
If he slammed Fikret Abi,
she isn't Muslim, boys.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.755
Slammed?

09:15.000 --> 09:18.595
Muslim or not, what's it to you?
They're in love. What's it to us?

09:18.960 --> 09:20.075
- Ýsmail Abi.
- What?

09:20.280 --> 09:23.511
"To you" to him and "to us" to him...
What's bugging you?

09:23.600 --> 09:25.750
The Latvia project is over now.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.996
So they want Marika in Italy,
me in Turkmenistan.

09:28.160 --> 09:31.391
For us to stay in the same country
means marrying PDQ.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.755
- In Timbuktu?
- Huh?

09:32.920 --> 09:35.275
- In Timbuktu?
- No, pretty damn quick.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.468
Poof-poof, poof-poof.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.558
Poof-poof, Çeto. Poof-poof.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.114
He caught us on the hop.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.911
If I'd known before,
I'd have got the money I'm owed...

09:45.320 --> 09:46.878
And done the wedding.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.473
We've been ambushed.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.956
Who can we ask for money
when it's Eid?

09:54.120 --> 09:57.112
We've eaten from every hand, Ýsmail.
Count our blessings!

09:57.880 --> 09:59.996
Don't go bowing and scraping again.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.429
F*ckaduck.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.274
- What's the fuss about, Ýsmail?
- What?

10:04.440 --> 10:07.716
The boy's worked abroad for years.
He must have savings.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.110
- Let him do the wedding.
- Now look!

10:13.840 --> 10:17.071
Look, son. A real father with us
has his son circumcised...

10:17.360 --> 10:21.831
Sends him to school, then the army
and gets him married. It's our way.

10:21.960 --> 10:27.637
I won't have this village accuse me
of not giving my son a wedding!

10:27.840 --> 10:30.308
If we have 10 days,
I'm doing this wedding.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.476
Dad, we'd planned
on something simple.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.477
Planned on what?
Is it your wedding?

10:34.760 --> 10:37.228
It's my wedding now!
That's my job.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.637
Now you tell me about Latvia,
the weather and all that.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.153
OK, Dad. If you say so.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.915
I say, friends,
we'll do this wedding in 10 days.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.435
Hah! I knew
you'd go round in circles...

10:48.560 --> 10:50.516
And end up
palming us off with the job.

10:52.920 --> 10:57.072
Ýsmail Abi, when you said 10 days
I figured you knew something.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.560
He does!
What kind of friends are you?

11:02.640 --> 11:04.835
He slammed Tank
because he trusted us.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.149
What's 'slam', Çeto?
It's on my brain now.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.752
<i>Fikret Abi gets fired up
faster than anyone you ever saw.</i>

11:12.960 --> 11:17.192
<i>Dad claims Fikret Abi runs on gas,
so he often calls him Gas Man Fikret.</i>

11:17.520 --> 11:21.911
<i>Fikret Abi is all words and no action.
A man of impulse. He runs a gas store.</i>

11:22.040 --> 11:23.109
Hello!

11:23.680 --> 11:24.635
Yes?

11:25.320 --> 11:26.309
No.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.909
Maybe.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.429
Get out of here!

11:29.600 --> 11:33.309
<i>He's also a bit rash.
He lost two wives to cancer.</i>

11:33.440 --> 11:36.477
<i>After his first wife died
he decided not to marry again.</i>

11:36.760 --> 11:39.115
<i>But he soon reneged
and remarried.</i>

11:39.360 --> 11:41.749
<i>He can keep a cool head
come what may.</i>

11:41.960 --> 11:43.837
<i>Fikret Abi never panics.</i>

11:50.520 --> 11:53.830
<i>Come here, boy.
C'mon, c'mon, in here.</i>

11:54.160 --> 11:55.115
Come here, c'mon.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.118
Look at the place!

11:57.440 --> 12:00.113
There's a leak.
The place stinks of gas.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.078
I have a cig on the go.
It'll get ugly. What is this?

12:03.560 --> 12:05.312
Sweep the place. Now!

12:06.080 --> 12:07.433
Tut-tut-tut.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.478
You want us on the main news, huh?

12:14.440 --> 12:15.634
Bünyamin.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.270
Tell your dad
to pay his gas debts.

12:18.680 --> 12:22.434
<i>So it was Fikret Abi
who was first to stand by Dad.</i>

12:22.680 --> 12:24.272
We'll do the wedding, Ýsmail Abi.

12:24.520 --> 12:27.512
Your son is mine.
I'll handle the venue.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.796
The wedding will be
at the Sivas Hotel.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.070
C'mon, Fikret Abi!
The place costs a fortune.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.708
I'll fix that.
Just leave it to me.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.189
What's your contribution?
Let's hear it!

12:37.360 --> 12:38.395
OK.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.677
I'll do the lemonade, cake,
spoons, the bridal convoy...

12:42.040 --> 12:44.395
And however many cars there are...

12:44.520 --> 12:46.875
All the ribbons for the wing-mirrors...

12:47.080 --> 12:49.150
Whether on the left or right.
Ýsmail Abi...

12:49.520 --> 12:53.195
The Prophet said help newlyweds.
I'll do the wedding outfits too.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.359
Mum can make them.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.911
Çetin, it's 5 years
since your mum was a tailor.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.230
OK, but would she let down her son?

13:01.640 --> 13:06.670
Çeto, your mum's blind.
Blind as a bat. That's why she quit.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.276
Çetin, we put your mum on a wage
so she'd quit, right?

13:11.800 --> 13:13.836
We do a whip-round every month, right?

13:14.040 --> 13:16.270
If I say I'll handle it,
I'll handle it.

13:16.600 --> 13:17.555
OK?

13:17.840 --> 13:18.909
OK?

13:19.120 --> 13:20.189
OK?!

13:20.440 --> 13:22.749
Çetin Abi was
a latecomer to the gang.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.073
The gang was his escape
from the loser crowd.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.869
He was wild in his youth.
He even demanded protection money.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.118
He drank heavily.
Got in a coma a few times.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.669
One day he was hammered again.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.440
<i>So badly it was dawn
when he found his way home.</i>

13:38.640 --> 13:39.993
But there was no one home.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.550
The neighbours said
his dad was catching a bus to Mecca.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.678
He ran to find his dad,
but could barely stand up.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.279
Stand up! You shame me.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.835
You aren't my son!

13:51.040 --> 13:53.952
Nothing had hurt Çetin Abi
until then. Until those words.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.436
What did it mean,
"You aren't my son!"?

14:10.840 --> 14:13.115
That night he dreamed of a mullah.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.919
So your father said
you weren't his son.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.432
There's only one thing to do then.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.199
I'll do anything, mullah.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.869
Only one thing for me to do,
not you.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.069
Hold this.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.269
Oh my God!

14:38.560 --> 14:40.790
Oh my God, oh my god!

14:47.040 --> 14:49.918
Who knows if he really was beaten
by the mullah?

14:50.200 --> 14:52.475
But Çetin Abi was changed
after that night.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.278
"It's over," he said.

14:54.800 --> 14:58.349
He never drank again.
He began to get his life in order.

15:01.520 --> 15:05.274
The poor give all, the rich just money
as they say, teacher.

15:05.760 --> 15:06.875
OK then.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.795
As Tarik is a friend,
as everyone's being selfless...

15:11.880 --> 15:14.155
I'll bring a musical diva,
I'll bring Emel Sayýn.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.994
Right. Her absence is felt.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.353
So Emel Sayýn wasn't
at my first circumcision...

15:20.640 --> 15:24.110
And the knife slipped.
That explains most of my problems.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.549
Sit down!

15:28.640 --> 15:31.393
Oh my God!
That's hysterical.

15:32.040 --> 15:36.113
They said they'd bring in
Roberto Carlos to head SivasSpor.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.590
That cracked me up
as much as this.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.835
But then they did.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.552
You shouldn't laugh at everything.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.313
Sivas has become something else.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.233
It's like I fight with Roberto
for parking spaces.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.637
But our wedding’s more Arabesque,
more Selami Þahin.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.154
- Really?
- Yes.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.193
I'm more into Doðan.
Latif Doðan, 'I'm Miffed'.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.709
Hah.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.989
It's more folksy.

15:58.280 --> 16:02.239
Fine, but they'd want a fortune.
Emel is family. If I ask, she'll come.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.634
It takes one call.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.672
She's my dad's aunt's cousin!

16:05.840 --> 16:11.075
To his aunt, to his aunt I lost my heart
It's rare you find a teacher half as smart.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.120
OK, bum deal,
we'll go for Emel.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.154
And if we find the money...

16:19.280 --> 16:21.475
We'll swap her for someone else.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.115
You make me laugh.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.716
Saffet Abi teaches primary school.
He's crazy for the job.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.112
He went to free boarding school
so feels he owes the state.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.917
Who knows how many villagers
he taught to read and write?

16:36.080 --> 16:39.038
He was last to join the gang.
It's a mystery how he did.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.072
If he's ever accused of lying,
it freaks him out.

16:42.440 --> 16:43.793
Why would I lie?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.355
She's my aunt's cousin.
Don't make me crazy!

16:46.480 --> 16:47.515
Drop it.

16:47.640 --> 16:52.270
At least my spin's half-believable.
The cake, lemonade, ribbons.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.389
The hotel owner's an army buddy.
He was at my barracks.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.910
We're like grandpa and grandson.
I'm grandpa.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.112
But his aunt's grandpa.
You figure that out!

17:04.760 --> 17:07.433
We're back here tomorrow night then.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.199
Dad had done it again.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.789
He'd made a decision
and roped in his friends.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.709
Call it charm or persuasion,
that was Dad's nature.

17:15.880 --> 17:16.915
Ýsmail!

17:17.200 --> 17:19.667
I was looking for you.
They said you were here.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.877
Here's your share.
Enjoy!

17:23.240 --> 17:24.468
God bless you.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.029
So no one stopped him
sacrificing the beast.

17:28.319 --> 17:29.355
That's too bad.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.995
Fora morsel of meat
they kept quiet.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.034
Nazmi Amca, is the hide
going to the mosque?

17:35.360 --> 17:38.318
There was no hide.
Not much hide this year.

17:38.920 --> 17:39.955
Don't eat that meat!

17:40.240 --> 17:41.639
Who knows what it is?

17:42.000 --> 17:42.989
Don't eat it.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.231
I'll ask the mukhtar
if anyone's missing.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.628
OK, God bless.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.189
Right.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.714
God bless.

17:50.720 --> 17:54.030
ÇETIN ABI IS NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR LOST (STOLEN) PROPERTY.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.229
HE'S A REFORMED MAN.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.313
Where have you been, Ýsmail?

18:02.520 --> 18:03.669
Oh my God!

18:05.560 --> 18:06.549
What time is it?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.838
I was just at the teahouse
with friends.

18:10.560 --> 18:13.836
The teahouse again, huh?
What kept you till this hour?

18:13.920 --> 18:15.558
It's your son’s fault.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.109
We're skint.
The boys and I are working on it.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.715
Let the boy
do the wedding himself.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.272
Your son's giving you these ideas,
isn't he?

18:24.520 --> 18:29.071
I see! He's your son
during school and the army...

18:29.280 --> 18:32.033
My son when it doesn't suit you, huh?
Well think again!

18:32.320 --> 18:36.472
Look, if you want to do that wedding,
stop being a mule...

18:36.560 --> 18:38.278
...and ask your brother for the money.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.112
I don't have a brother!

18:42.280 --> 18:43.235
Got tha...

18:44.280 --> 18:45.349
Hatice?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.149
Hatice.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.311
Where are you?
I'm scared of the dark.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.949
<i>Baby, when Dad said that,
what could I do?</i>

18:56.560 --> 18:57.629
Thanks.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.030
Dad talked about the Sivas Hotel.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.953
But it's not definite yet.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.148
Selam aleykum!

19:44.840 --> 19:46.956
Whoa! A valet, huh?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.231
Hey, park the truck somewhere decent.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.075
No cruising or you're screwed.
I know the mileage. Here.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.875
Nice catch.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.233
Oaf!
Don't make the lady carry it.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.674
She's your mum's age.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.033
Hah!

20:14.400 --> 20:15.469
Made for each other.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.555
Can I help?

20:16.640 --> 20:20.349
Hello. It's years since I saw
such a picture of beauty, ma'am.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.558
That's why it won't come out.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.715
She's embarrassed.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.671
It's stuck in my mouth.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.592
- What do we do?
- How can I help?

20:28.680 --> 20:31.069
I just put the swankiest hello
you'll ever see...

20:31.400 --> 20:34.119
Right here.
First take it.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.594
Sir, let me help.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.278
Beat it!
Don't piss me off!

20:37.880 --> 20:41.350
Give me a tent in an earthquake
and I'd still sleep outside!

20:43.880 --> 20:45.313
My brown beauty, my rose.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.391
I even use brown sugar in my tea.

20:47.840 --> 20:48.989
You ha...

20:49.200 --> 20:50.315
Yes, officer?

20:50.600 --> 20:51.828
Who are you after?

20:52.040 --> 20:53.473
Who am I after? Umm...

20:53.840 --> 20:58.152
Young black-tache Sirn of Adýyamanlý.
Good-timer Sirn. The hotel owner.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.554
Who are you?

20:59.720 --> 21:01.756
Who? Say Grandpa Fikret.
Gas man Fikret.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.634
But he won't know what I do
in ciwy street.

21:05.480 --> 21:06.674
Say Gunner Fikret.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.479
I was a gunner in the army.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.475
Now go!

21:12.040 --> 21:14.679
Where were we
before he interrupted?

21:15.560 --> 21:16.788
Where are you going?

21:17.240 --> 21:19.754
You chased her away.
God damn you!

21:20.040 --> 21:22.156
Yes, you! You aren't my type.
Beat it!

21:24.680 --> 21:28.229
<i>Hello? Sir, your grandfather,
Gunner Fikret is here.</i>

21:29.080 --> 21:30.035
Who?

21:30.240 --> 21:31.832
<i>Your grandfather,
Gunner Fikret.</i>

21:31.880 --> 21:34.952
Is this a joke?
What grandfather? What gunner?

21:35.520 --> 21:37.715
Don't you know
my grandfathers are dead?

21:37.920 --> 21:39.717
I was confused too, sir.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.239
<i>He said he's a gas man.</i>

21:41.320 --> 21:42.275
A gas man?

21:42.360 --> 21:43.998
- Yes.
- Idiot!

21:44.320 --> 21:46.436
Who needs deliveries?
We use mains gas...

21:46.600 --> 21:48.272
<i>- At this hotel!
- Sorry, sir.</i>

21:48.480 --> 21:50.596
I'll stop bothering you.
Goodbye.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.958
Aren't the tourism guys here?
It's a holiday dammit.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.473
No, just the gas man.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.553
Still the gas man.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.035
Hang up!

22:01.040 --> 22:02.075
Fikret Bey.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.475
Yes, officer?
Is there some mistake?

22:04.600 --> 22:08.229
No, but Sirn Bey is busy.
He'll see you later.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.828
See you in an hour.
I'll drop off my orders.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.756
Ýsmail, I say...

22:16.000 --> 22:19.913
We do a dead simple, no-frills wedding.
I talked to Tank.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.630
He said, "Don't bust a gut for me.
I don't need a party. "

22:24.160 --> 22:26.469
We already discussed this, Missus.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.432
It's all taken care of.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.838
We're doing a team effort.
You stay out of it.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.628
That's my job.

22:34.240 --> 22:38.119
Look, Fikret...
Is talking to the Sivas Hotel.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.953
So we'll soon be
all over the Sivas Post.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.314
- Is that it?
- Well now.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.908
Fikret is right out of his depth.

22:46.320 --> 22:49.596
His wife borrowed money last month.
She still hasn't paid me back.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.632
She just says Fikret is owed,
but he can't ask for it.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.198
Well, she's right.
I owe Fikret a bit.

22:57.480 --> 23:00.040
So look, I owe Fikret a bit.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.673
His wife owes my wife a bit.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.388
It's a mighty mess.
Does Çetin have money?

23:06.520 --> 23:07.873
- Çetin?
- Yes.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.473
What's he doing?

23:11.400 --> 23:13.994
Not getting his mum
to make the wedding dress?

23:17.520 --> 23:19.078
His mum's blind, right?

23:22.440 --> 23:24.192
My sides will split.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.799
God willing.

23:27.960 --> 23:30.030
Do you mean that, Ýsmail?

23:31.880 --> 23:34.474
Where are you going?
Your breakfast. Ýsmail!

23:34.760 --> 23:35.795
Whoa!

23:37.840 --> 23:38.955
Oh my God!

23:39.720 --> 23:40.789
Oh my God!

23:41.760 --> 23:44.035
Oh my God!
Who put that there?

23:45.160 --> 23:47.310
Go get...
wise in the ways of God.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.469
Stay focused.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.511
Stay focused!
Everyone here!

23:56.800 --> 23:58.756
Put love into that punch.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.791
The aim is not
to beat up your opponent.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.108
It's to bring him into society.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.674
Remember, put love into it.
What's up?

24:05.120 --> 24:06.394
Remember, put love into it.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.040
Punch his soul, not his body.
Smile.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.748
Smile
so he smiles back.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.793
I fought 61 matches
as a pro boxer.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.878
That's 58 knockouts in a row.
I lost.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.868
A two-win streak escaped me.
I never forget.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.515
I promised myself I'd quit boxing
if I won the next fight.

24:25.720 --> 24:26.914
I won that fight.

24:27.040 --> 24:31.875
No punch will make you unhappy.
Because no one unhappy can change the world.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.429
A 61 license plate is from Trabzon.
A58?

24:34.560 --> 24:35.515
Sivas!

24:35.600 --> 24:39.040
So why can't another Olympic
champion come out of this class?

24:39.040 --> 24:40.393
Another Hamza Yerlikaya!

24:40.760 --> 24:42.273
You two, over there.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.068
C'mon, move!

24:44.600 --> 24:47.990
Anyone late with fees
trains on the fridge today.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.518
OK, a standard punch bag
is good for 65,000 punches.

24:52.680 --> 24:55.069
I'm not wasting it on you.
Now get training.

24:57.880 --> 24:58.869
Mum, Mum?

24:59.560 --> 25:00.913
Watch your friends.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.195
Mum, Mum!

25:02.480 --> 25:03.435
Mum.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.676
Mum, I tell you what.

25:07.320 --> 25:10.073
Classical music is over.
Nothing new comes out.

25:10.520 --> 25:14.752
Where are Baroque and the Romantics?
It's out with Bach, in with Baha.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.309
Çetin, I have no money.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.111
Mum, don't give me grief.
Look.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.716
I'm on a thin line between being
and not being. I'm invisible.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.552
Imagine.
The line's wider than me.

25:24.720 --> 25:25.948
I can't borrow.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.753
What do you mean, Mum?
I was on Voice of Sivas TV.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.396
They reported on me beating up
the boxing boys for their fees.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.556
If the governor hears...

25:34.760 --> 25:37.354
This place will close.
How will I get the money?

25:37.480 --> 25:38.959
I've no more gold.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.519
Oof!

25:41.120 --> 25:42.109
Really?

25:42.400 --> 25:44.960
Sit quietly now.
Ýlyas, back to your place!

25:45.960 --> 25:49.555
<i>Hello? This is Saffet from Sivas.
I'm a cousin...</i>

25:49.920 --> 25:51.035
Of Emel Sayýn.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.913
<i>Say Gürbüz Ahmet’s son
and she'll know.</i>

25:57.440 --> 25:59.317
Give me your number.

25:59.680 --> 26:02.353
<i>Emel Haným is tied up.
I'll call when she's free.</i>

26:02.440 --> 26:03.429
OK.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.959
<i>Do you have a pen?</i>

26:05.120 --> 26:07.475
Yes.
Go ahead.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.354
- 3.
- 3.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.312
- 32.
- 32.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.278
- 16
- OK, 16.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.557
Thanks.
I'll be waiting.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.229
Play this lot.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.273
Stop!
Move back.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.670
There you go. Up!
Stand up!

26:29.480 --> 26:30.549
What did I say?

26:30.800 --> 26:34.190
What happens if you don't pay
your fees on time? This!

26:34.560 --> 26:37.791
I'll come find you
wherever you are...

26:37.960 --> 26:41.669
And get my money. It's not yours.
Now c'mon, box!

26:45.240 --> 26:46.229
Tank.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.551
How old is the bride?

26:49.280 --> 26:50.269
Same age as me.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.075
Does she speak Turkish?

26:55.240 --> 26:57.913
Well, she hears
but she can't speak it.

27:02.960 --> 27:07.954
Tarik, you're in an awful hurry
to get married, you know.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.677
Well, it gives us
all kinds of ideas, son.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.110
C'mon, out with it.
I won't be angry.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.832
But what's the question?

27:15.960 --> 27:17.632
Tell your wet nurse.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.472
What are you talking about?

27:19.560 --> 27:21.437
Did you get the girl pregnant?

27:21.720 --> 27:23.278
Answer your wet nurse.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.392
It's obvious what you'll say,
but answer the question.

27:26.680 --> 27:29.148
No, Mum. Are you crazy?
We use protection.

27:29.320 --> 27:32.437
Protection against who, what?
Why don't we know?

27:32.560 --> 27:33.595
No, not that.
Well...

27:33.800 --> 27:35.597
Protection against umm...

27:35.840 --> 27:37.114
Against what?

27:40.680 --> 27:42.432
Oh my!
Let's go.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.352
This boy is bad.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.310
Run!
How could you say that?

27:47.400 --> 27:48.719
How could you ask that?

27:48.920 --> 27:51.992
May you be struck down by rocks
as big as me!

27:53.040 --> 27:54.109
Just like your dad.

28:01.720 --> 28:02.948
Take him away.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.073
It would be fair to say
we did this to promote tourism.

28:09.360 --> 28:13.194
Well, well, well! Sirn,
the wayward grandson. Selam aleykum.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.637
Lady, can I stick this here?
It's to go a customer.

28:17.960 --> 28:18.915
Sirn!

28:20.760 --> 28:21.875
Who are the dames there?

28:21.960 --> 28:24.394
If they were horses,
I'd stake my fortune.

28:24.520 --> 28:27.193
150 small gas bottles, 60 big,
they're worth it.

28:27.360 --> 28:31.273
Fikret, my friend.
We're in a crucial meeting here.

28:31.400 --> 28:34.073
If we can finish it,
then I'll help you.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.919
Help yourself first.
Your fly’s open.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.511
True, you should leave
the door to a dead man's house open.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.388
I found it funny.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.832
Anyway my thing's urgent.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.797
You know our Ýsmail,
the smith?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.433
His son's getting married.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.432
I say do the wedding here.
Huh?

28:51.560 --> 28:52.993
- We were discussing that.
- The wedding?

28:53.160 --> 28:54.354
No, tourism.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.872
Now that Sivas
is on the tourist map...

28:58.080 --> 28:59.433
A lot of tourists come.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.914
Let's see...

29:03.040 --> 29:04.519
We're fully booked.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.478
What do tourists want in Sivas?

29:07.760 --> 29:09.671
There's no sea, nothing.
Just a river.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.279
They'd bathe in that?

29:11.800 --> 29:13.233
Look, see her?

29:13.680 --> 29:16.399
If she were moonshine
I'd drink her neat.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.040
Fix me the dark one.
I'll down her in one.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.235
Just a second.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.191
Tourists don't come here?

29:22.280 --> 29:24.271
Of course they do, lady.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.398
- Annually at least-
- One day.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.994
Talk all you like.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.668
Look, lady.
I'm from Sivas born and bred.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.639
The tourist sights
are 2-3 hours away.

29:34.840 --> 29:38.196
It's a public holiday.
How many guests here? Zero, nix.

29:38.480 --> 29:39.469
Sirn!

29:40.960 --> 29:43.110
That dark one, OK?
If she wrote a book...

29:44.360 --> 29:45.315
I'd read it.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.556
Think, the book and me.
I tell you I'd read it.

29:47.680 --> 29:50.194
I've one industrial gas bottle,
that's yours too.

29:50.280 --> 29:54.034
- C'mon, fix it, Sirn.
- We'll handle that later.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.469
But why talk about Sivas like this?

29:56.600 --> 29:59.114
Look, we're growing.
We have a university.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.950
So Sivas is growing.
You know, growing.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.473
What, growing to you?

30:04.200 --> 30:05.679
What's the population of Sivas?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.309
623,000.
How many Sivas people in Istanbul?

30:08.480 --> 30:11.074
- 2, maybe 2.5-
- No way!

30:11.320 --> 30:13.834
3! Istanbul has
3 million Sivas people.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.996
If we don't stay here,
why would tourists?

30:16.360 --> 30:17.349
The man's right.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.591
So, partner?
We do the wedding here?

30:21.800 --> 30:22.755
OK.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.189
Hah!

30:28.600 --> 30:29.555
Fiko.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.469
Is that gas bottle full?

30:31.680 --> 30:32.829
Yes.

30:39.280 --> 30:43.114
It's tourist season at the Sivas Hotel
so they're booked up.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.192
- Sirn said so.
- Fikret!

30:45.480 --> 30:47.232
Did the bastards beat you up?

30:47.640 --> 30:50.632
- There was a small spat between us.
- Fikret Abi...

30:50.920 --> 30:53.832
Give me the bastard's name
and I'll trash his love train.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.230
Give me the name,
the name, the name.

30:56.520 --> 30:57.475
Dammit!

30:57.640 --> 31:01.838
Any guy who can beat up me,
Fikret, the gas man...

31:04.800 --> 31:06.631
He's at the Sivas Hotel, boys.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.755
But he beat me up
something else, Çeto.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.230
Twice on the way home
I forgot my name.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.437
And a few times...

31:16.520 --> 31:18.795
I didn't know where I was.
I lost the plot.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.639
Here, friend.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.393
OK, 20 lira for?

31:24.600 --> 31:25.953
Winston Light, two packs.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.952
We don't sell cigs.

31:28.440 --> 31:29.793
Some newsstand!

31:32.840 --> 31:34.831
Thanks a lot.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.353
Hey, are we moving?

31:42.520 --> 31:44.397
- How many of them?
- Huh?

31:44.840 --> 31:45.989
How many of them?

31:46.680 --> 31:49.990
OK, no slandering.
It was Sirn on his own.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.680
He bashed away at my head
with the gas bottle.

31:52.960 --> 31:56.350
Sly dog,
he gets me with my own weapon.

31:56.800 --> 31:57.755
Look.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.149
It's all dented.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.515
My customer refused to take it.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.471
Ýsmail Abi,
let me go trash the guy.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.876
First let's see to the wedding,
then Sirn.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.753
It's nothing.
Now where are you with food and drink?

32:11.160 --> 32:13.435
- When did we get to that?
- We already got there.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.636
Umm, they need cash.

32:16.080 --> 32:18.640
They need supplies, right?
They have a point.

32:19.080 --> 32:22.356
If we're stuffed on that,
I won't even ask about Emel Sayýn.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.629
- No, ask.
- Emel Sayýn?

32:23.880 --> 32:24.995
We're relatives.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.397
Doing that really bugs me.

32:27.640 --> 32:28.868
I swear she’s family.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.150
I got her manager today.
I'll call back.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.469
Teacher, zip it!

32:32.920 --> 32:35.593
Ýsmail Abi,
let's fix the cash thing ASAP.

32:36.280 --> 32:39.078
The lady took me by the arm
to the clinic.

32:39.480 --> 32:43.075
Coming back I hit on my own wife.
I talked dirty in her ear.

32:43.760 --> 32:44.988
I thought she was hot for me.

32:45.480 --> 32:50.031
I slung my wife of 7 years,
my lawful wife into a friend's house.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.192
But she was so cute, Çeto.

32:52.960 --> 32:53.915
So cute.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.555
Anyway, all tradesmen are friends.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.197
Talking face to face is different.
If we ask, they'll agree.

33:02.600 --> 33:03.874
Tomorrow's another day.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.917
Ýsmail Abi, you keep shifting gears.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.752
Who's your father?

33:08.320 --> 33:09.275
Kinyas?

33:09.440 --> 33:11.510
Tell your dad to pay
for his gas.

33:12.440 --> 33:15.079
You shut up!
I'm talking to the kid.

33:15.640 --> 33:16.675
I'll break your bones.

33:16.800 --> 33:17.994
Have this bottle.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.029
Here!

33:20.280 --> 33:21.269
C'mon, take it!

33:29.920 --> 33:32.229
Was that confetti?

33:32.520 --> 33:35.159
Guys, I've battled
with this mindset for years.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.515
I don't get
what makes people think...

33:37.680 --> 33:40.353
There's big money
in selling appliances.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.556
Look, Abdullah Abi.
Ogün's there. Ogün, Ogün!

33:42.840 --> 33:44.239
Throw the ball, c'mon!

33:44.440 --> 33:45.759
C'mon, boys. C'mon.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.998
Ali. Sami.
Let's hear it!

33:50.400 --> 33:53.039
Look, it's your duty to help Tank.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.839
We're boys from the same village.
Don't let me down.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.478
Look at all those fridges.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.433
If anyone has money, it's you.
C'mon, help us out.

34:00.600 --> 34:04.912
None of this is mine.
I just sell it and get a percentage.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.878
Just give us one of these TVs.
This one, say.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.310
Hey, Fikret.
Fikret, stop! Hey!

34:10.639 --> 34:11.914
Don't you do gas deliveries?

34:13.159 --> 34:15.196
- Yes.
- Are all the gas bottles yours?

34:15.280 --> 34:16.235
Yes.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.594
Who else's?

34:17.760 --> 34:18.909
Çeto, what's he saying?

34:19.080 --> 34:20.831
I'd sell someone else's gas?

34:22.199 --> 34:23.155
For God's sake.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.231
What's he saying?
F*ck your gas bottle!

34:25.480 --> 34:26.594
Fikret Abi,
what's with you?

34:26.760 --> 34:27.954
The catalogue.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.393
Here's the cost price of everything.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.638
OK? I sell the stuff.

34:33.920 --> 34:37.275
I pay the cost price plus my costs.
It's not my stuff!

34:37.679 --> 34:40.717
Saffet, you're an educated guy.
Please explain!

34:40.960 --> 34:42.678
I'll do my best then.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.674
Friends...

34:45.440 --> 34:47.271
It isn't his stuff.
That's that.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.993
Don't blame him,
he's a worker.

34:49.080 --> 34:52.197
Thanks, teacher.
Nothing beats an educated man.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.188
Give us an oven.

34:55.400 --> 34:56.435
Yes, an oven.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.230
If the fridges aren't yours,
we at least deserve an oven, Zeki.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.471
My blood pressure's shooting up.

35:02.880 --> 35:03.800
It's ours.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.109
Toraman.
We have to get something.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.033
This sucks.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.557
A whole day of arm-twisting
and look what we end up with.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.074
Home bread won't even fit.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.555
A toaster will get us nowhere.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.439
Just to reiterate,
it's not the man's stuff.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.837
- He just gets a cut.
- Right. It's all your fault.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.508
We got the point,
but pretended not to.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.397
You and your wise-guy trips.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.790
He's a teacher, right?
He's educated.

35:33.960 --> 35:37.032
So our Zeki revs him up
and he goes for it.

35:37.160 --> 35:38.912
Where's Emel, huh?
Where's Emel Sayýn?

35:39.320 --> 35:40.719
Where's Emel Sayýn?

35:40.920 --> 35:42.433
I'm not falling for it!

35:42.520 --> 35:45.114
<i>Love is a big need in life</i>

35:45.320 --> 35:48.517
<i>Everyone needs to love
and be loved</i>

35:48.840 --> 35:51.752
<i>Be friends with everyone,
friends with all</i>

35:52.400 --> 35:55.551
<i>Life is slipping by, you know</i>

35:55.880 --> 35:59.077
<i>Someone here has it,
someone there, someone everywhere</i>

35:59.320 --> 36:00.992
<i>Whoever has the blue-eye bead</i>

36:01.160 --> 36:03.435
<i>Has my heart
Someone here...</i>

36:10.000 --> 36:12.520
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:12.520 --> 36:13.839
- Fikret Abi!
- What?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:13.839 --> 36:14.120
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:14.120 --> 36:16.475
You had four coffees.
You only paid for two.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:16.475 --> 36:16.600
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:16.600 --> 36:17.919
Two were cold.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:17.919 --> 36:18.040
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:18.040 --> 36:19.234
For God's sake.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:19.234 --> 36:19.680
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:19.680 --> 36:20.749
Ýsmail.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:20.749 --> 36:21.400
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:21.400 --> 36:22.000
Here, I made a list.
Have a look.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:22.000 --> 36:23.311
Here, I made a list.
Have a look.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.908
Anything missing?
Take it, here.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.235
What's this?

36:30.320 --> 36:32.038
These figures by the names?

36:32.160 --> 36:35.232
Whatever we gave at their weddings,
it's all there.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.790
Always quarter gold coins.
If only we'd given whole coins.

36:39.480 --> 36:40.799
- What's this?
- What?

36:40.920 --> 36:43.115
Look, it says 130 loaves of bread.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.430
We gave Nazif 130 loaves of bread?

36:45.720 --> 36:49.554
Well, it was worth
130 loaves of bread at the time.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.159
We gave them Marks, huh?

36:51.720 --> 36:53.995
Hey, this is a mighty long list.

36:54.520 --> 36:58.195
Ýsmail? Is your brother coming?
Are we inviting him?

36:58.960 --> 37:00.075
We'll see.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.391
- That's my job.
- Oh God.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.029
- The wedding hall?
- We'll see. That's my job.

37:06.160 --> 37:09.038
- The invites?
- We'll see. That's my job.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.240
We'll see. That's my job.

37:12.760 --> 37:16.275
Well, look sharp.
The girl's family arrives tomorrow.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.754
Turn out the light.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.912
Now would I let you down?

37:30.320 --> 37:34.279
You shouldn't even have come.
I'd have sent the boy round.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.675
You're a good lad.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.312
It's my duty, Ýsmail Abi.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.438
We're from the same village.
We must stand by each other.

37:42.720 --> 37:43.789
Right, Fikret Abi?

37:43.880 --> 37:46.030
Bravo.
Your dad was a decent man too.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.316
Want me to take your dick for a spin?

37:49.040 --> 37:52.635
OK, my lad.
Now take this bag and fill it...

37:53.000 --> 37:54.479
As full as you like.

37:54.680 --> 37:57.831
These favors you do
will become legend, you know?

37:58.240 --> 38:03.155
You know what? You make me
want to stroke your spleen, I swear.

38:03.560 --> 38:06.916
Look, I'll tell Tarik
to set up a Facebook group for you.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.793
You're the pride of Sivas,
not just its jeweler.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.272
C'mon, please.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.633
Anyone else would do the same.

38:16.640 --> 38:20.315
But the thing is, I only have
27 followers on Twitter.

38:20.840 --> 38:25.709
So I'd love it if you told Tank
to do a Friday Follow to my account.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.473
I'm kind of antisocial.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.631
I don't have
Twitter or Facebook at home.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.440
But like I said,
I'll take your dick fora spin.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.596
Look, we'll find those followers
and give them hell, don't you worry.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.356
Punks! Who are they following?
This is Sivas!

38:41.560 --> 38:44.154
- It's harassment.
- We're onto it, don't worry.

38:44.840 --> 38:47.229
We'll go then
before trashing the place.

38:47.360 --> 38:49.999
Then I'll umm
give you this.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.355
Did you take a good look?

38:54.360 --> 38:56.430
Just a single quarter in there, huh?

38:56.800 --> 38:58.870
Just this, Ýsmail Abi.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.117
I'll strangle that boy like a turkey,
Ýsmail Abi.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.839
- All that talk.
- This is beyond us.

39:05.160 --> 39:08.152
And the girl's family
are on a plane.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.870
We've messed up here.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.709
Abi, don't get mad,
but I have an idea.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.958
Your brother might help.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.753
Right away if I asked.

39:19.920 --> 39:23.196
The wedding's beyond me, right?
He'd help like a shot.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.919
Time fora confab.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.390
Brethren, to the front row please.

39:28.960 --> 39:32.794
There'll be a ton of jewelry given
at the wedding. If we were to keep it...

39:33.760 --> 39:34.749
Just suppose.

39:35.560 --> 39:39.633
If we use that for our expenses,
the jewelry money will subrevize it.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.430
Subrevize?
What are you talking about?

39:42.520 --> 39:44.078
Just that, Fikret Abi.

39:44.200 --> 39:47.351
Ýsmail Abi, let's go right now
and get a loan from the bank.

39:47.560 --> 39:50.120
- The cleanest kind.
- The cleanest kind?

39:50.920 --> 39:53.195
We'll use it on the basics.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.073
We'll all get fake jewelry
to give at the wedding.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.433
So it won't cost anything.

39:58.560 --> 40:02.269
We'll pay the loan with money
from the jewelry. If we keep it.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.830
We'll keep it,
I'll see to that.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.593
So what do you say?

40:07.880 --> 40:09.199
A loan in whose name?

40:09.400 --> 40:12.073
The name of love, brotherhood,
humanity, the collective!

40:14.520 --> 40:16.715
In Ýsmail Abi's name.
Ýsmail Yücesoy.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.996
The loan will be in my name.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.359
Did you bring a pay slip?

40:20.480 --> 40:22.471
I only brought my ID.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.558
The other thing I didn't umm...
What was it?

40:25.720 --> 40:27.199
A pay slip.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.555
That's a paper
showing how much you earn.

40:29.680 --> 40:32.831
Hah, I see. I'm retired.
I'm on a pension.

40:33.040 --> 40:36.191
You can't borrow
more than a year's pension.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.151
And only from your pension bank.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.509
The loan is deducted monthly.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.871
Mention the jewelry.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.991
Now look, the thing is this.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.790
As soon as we get the jewelry
we'll pay you back.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.718
We can't lend to pensioners.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.711
Oof, I've had it.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.115
Wait, Ýsmail Abi.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.275
I'll take it on.

40:55.600 --> 40:56.953
Banker, give it to me.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.353
What do you do for a living?

40:59.720 --> 41:01.756
I'm the boss.
I run my own business.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.638
- In what?
- Unnatural gas and energy.

41:04.760 --> 41:09.390
Then we need a certified statement
of your revenues for the last 5 years.

41:10.520 --> 41:13.114
I'm OK sending it
with the boy, right?

41:14.160 --> 41:17.755
OK, lady. What's the cleanest way
to get this loan?

41:18.920 --> 41:20.512
Come in!

41:25.760 --> 41:26.749
Scalawags.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.553
Ýsmail Abi, they scared me.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.075
Fikret Abi, see that?

41:35.240 --> 41:37.037
How he's trained the kids?

41:37.160 --> 41:39.435
They stood up
the second we came in.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.112
Kids, selam aleykum!

41:41.280 --> 41:42.793
Thanks!

41:43.680 --> 41:44.635
Anyway.

41:44.840 --> 41:47.400
Kids, sit quietly now.
Bravo.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.397
Ýsmail Abi, what's up?
Nothing bad?

41:49.480 --> 41:51.869
Now, Saffet.
They want you at the bank.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.351
I'll explain on the way.
It's a long story.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.630
- OK, but the kids?
- I'll handle that.

41:57.480 --> 41:58.435
Take this.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.596
Go with Ýsmail Abi.
Go, Saffet.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.269
- Umm...
- C'mon.

42:02.400 --> 42:04.436
I'll handle it.
Off you go.

42:04.720 --> 42:05.709
How are you, kids?

42:05.920 --> 42:07.433
Fine thanks!

42:09.680 --> 42:11.159
Boy, is it annoying.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.633
Hey, teacher!

42:19.080 --> 42:23.232
Hey, thanks. Bless you!
What would we have done without you?

42:23.600 --> 42:25.556
Bless us all.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.478
Ýsmail Abi, we're sure to get
15,000 lira from the jewelry, huh?

42:27.600 --> 42:29.670
We'll see.
That's your job.

42:29.760 --> 42:33.196
- But you said at least 15-20,000.
- No, I didn't!

42:33.600 --> 42:34.828
That was Fikret.

42:35.440 --> 42:39.399
How do I know what I said?
I landed a gas bottle 2 days ago!

42:39.720 --> 42:41.153
I have hallucinations.

42:41.280 --> 42:43.794
Last night I saw Dad.
He was back from war in Cyprus.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.915
He said the front
needed beefing up.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.035
I said, "Do it!"

42:48.120 --> 42:49.951
"Yes, sir!" he said and left.
It's bad.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.712
The family has it rough.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.913
This sucks.

42:58.040 --> 43:01.794
Matter expands when heated,
contracts on cooling? Makes sense.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.515
Atatürk!

43:03.640 --> 43:08.156
So in which provinces did he hold
congresses? Sivas, Erzurum, Tokat and?

43:08.440 --> 43:11.079
- Amasya!
- Right.

43:11.240 --> 43:15.392
A trick question. You weren't fooled.
I've family in Tokat. My mind drifted.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.232
Never mind that.

43:17.360 --> 43:21.353
First memorize this: The foundations
of the Republic were laid in Sivas.

43:21.840 --> 43:22.795
Sit down.

43:24.120 --> 43:26.270
Çetin Abi,
why are the kids on one leg?

43:26.440 --> 43:28.158
- They're ours, teacher.
- Meaning?

43:28.320 --> 43:31.073
Call the kids at the board B-set.
B-set's a joint set.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.753
Your students and mine.

43:32.880 --> 43:36.350
The students on my course
owe fees. So I punished them.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.916
Let me hand over.

43:41.440 --> 43:42.793
Hey, listen!

43:43.160 --> 43:45.958
Wherever you are
I'll come find you.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.753
I'll get my money.

43:48.520 --> 43:49.509
Back to your place.

43:50.520 --> 43:52.078
Back to your places!

43:53.760 --> 43:56.228
One of the kids
is doing push-ups outside!

43:56.320 --> 43:59.039
He hasn't paid his fees
for 3 whole months.

43:59.320 --> 44:02.710
Standing on one foot was too easy.
Kids, I'm going.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.518
Goodbye!

44:04.880 --> 44:06.632
What did we talk about?

44:06.920 --> 44:10.515
- Selam aleykum!
- Aleykum selam!

44:10.920 --> 44:12.399
Suck on that, teacher.

44:13.520 --> 44:14.635
OK, I'm off.

44:27.560 --> 44:28.515
Agh!

44:34.320 --> 44:37.278
Oof, you didn't get my point.
This is Sivas!

44:42.840 --> 44:45.479
Where's her family?
When are they coming?

44:46.320 --> 44:49.357
I meant to tell you, dad.
There just wasn't a chance.

44:49.520 --> 44:52.273
Marika has no family.

44:53.040 --> 44:54.951
She lost her parents as a child.

44:55.120 --> 44:56.155
Poor dear.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.754
Does she have no other relatives?

44:58.880 --> 45:02.111
Aunts, uncles, whatever?
I made up all those beds.

45:02.280 --> 45:03.872
Marika has no family.

45:04.920 --> 45:08.117
She grew up in care.
The state put her through school.

45:08.440 --> 45:11.159
She needs to be among people,
you know?

45:12.040 --> 45:15.316
Now look,
what are their customs?

45:16.560 --> 45:19.791
Just like ours, dad.
It'll be just how you want it.

45:20.680 --> 45:23.638
Hah, that's.
It's easy.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.438
I'll see to that.
Now, missus.

45:25.600 --> 45:29.878
Make the guests at home.
I'm off to the teahouse.

45:30.280 --> 45:32.191
Wait, wait.
Ýsmail.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.468
What?

45:33.600 --> 45:35.955
Take this to your brother, dear.

45:36.120 --> 45:38.429
After all, he's our elder.
Here.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.995
Hey! You had invites printed?

45:41.480 --> 45:43.710
How many?
So you had money saved?

45:43.840 --> 45:45.876
What money?
These are samples.

45:46.280 --> 45:50.273
I went to the printer and told him
to print one of each, then I'd choose.

45:50.440 --> 45:51.953
Bless him, he did it.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.389
Are you...

45:54.280 --> 45:55.998
Trying to tell me something?

45:56.480 --> 45:58.675
I have four for Ýshak here.
You?

46:02.800 --> 46:06.031
- Forget what you asked, OK?
- What's he saying?

46:08.680 --> 46:10.716
Did he make her miserable?

46:10.920 --> 46:14.276
That's my girl! Now look.
Which one do you fancy?

46:14.640 --> 46:18.189
There's one with ribbon,
one with lace, everything.

46:18.440 --> 46:19.634
- Let's see.
- Look.

46:19.800 --> 46:23.076
Seeing it's an alcohol-free wedding
this is my to-do list.

46:23.360 --> 46:26.511
Well, I've done my bit.
So what about Fikret Abi?

46:27.040 --> 46:29.474
Like Ýsmail Abi said,
the girl has no family.

46:29.760 --> 46:32.274
So you know
our Nuri Abi's tea garden?

46:32.720 --> 46:35.871
I say we do it there.
Plus it'll be cool. In this heat...

46:36.480 --> 46:37.435
It'll be cool.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.875
Fikret, let's just admit it.

46:40.440 --> 46:42.351
Our first try was an epic fail.

46:43.200 --> 46:47.193
I guess your dad thought so too, Çeto.
He had no more kids after you.

46:47.480 --> 46:49.198
Once bitten, twice shy.

46:49.400 --> 46:52.039
Bravo!
That's the way to slam a guy.

46:54.440 --> 46:57.637
OK, to go from the Sivas Hotel
to the Family Tea Garden...

46:57.880 --> 46:59.359
It's a f*cker.
Anyway.

46:59.680 --> 47:02.353
Now look, Samet.
How's your side of things?

47:02.600 --> 47:03.953
It's Sermet.

47:04.920 --> 47:06.672
No, c'mon! It's Sergen.

47:06.840 --> 47:08.239
Hey, c'mon! I'm Saadet.

47:08.480 --> 47:10.675
A pleasure.
You're new in the village?

47:10.800 --> 47:12.313
What happened with your task?

47:12.440 --> 47:14.112
I tried her again today.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.509
OK, I'll say it again.
I swear she’s family.

47:16.680 --> 47:20.275
I just can't reach her.
She's at concerts, on tour.

47:20.400 --> 47:21.594
End result?

47:22.120 --> 47:23.473
The Sivas Hotel.

47:24.560 --> 47:26.152
Saadet made a dig at me, Çeto.

47:26.440 --> 47:28.351
What can I do?
It's a bummer.

47:28.400 --> 47:31.756
Someone local just qualified
for Popstar Eurostyle. I'll ask them.

47:31.800 --> 47:32.789
Great.

47:32.880 --> 47:36.509
And get some dancers from the club.
To pole dance.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.030
Sponsored by gas man Fikret.

47:41.360 --> 47:42.349
I found it funny.

47:42.640 --> 47:45.837
Ýsmail Abi, I spoke to Yilmaz
about that fake jewelry.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.558
Let's get that out the way.

47:47.720 --> 47:50.154
But it'll take an hour or two.
I say don't dally.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.595
There's no rush.
It's in Sivas, right?

47:52.800 --> 47:55.234
But not like you think.
It's a trek.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.438
Whoa!

48:01.760 --> 48:03.990
What is that?
It's like a Photoshop job.

48:04.360 --> 48:07.033
A graphic designer did that.
No architect would.

48:07.320 --> 48:08.753
Teacher, don't overdo it.

48:09.240 --> 48:11.549
Yilmaz Bey just had
precautions in mind.

48:11.920 --> 48:12.875
What precautions?

48:12.960 --> 48:15.269
Say the gendarmes raid the place.

48:16.040 --> 48:16.995
What will he do?

48:17.240 --> 48:19.754
Pour vats of boiling pitch
from up there?

48:19.920 --> 48:22.753
Fire flaming arrows?
What will he do? Huh?

48:22.960 --> 48:25.110
Ýsmail Abi,
what's with the rage?

48:25.240 --> 48:27.470
It doesn't faze the man.
What's a few steps?

48:27.680 --> 48:28.635
95!

48:28.760 --> 48:30.352
- Hah.
- I bothered to count.

48:30.880 --> 48:32.154
Çeto, I dare you.

48:32.840 --> 48:33.955
Bring Ferhat here.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.430
Tell him Shirin's waiting
up in the house.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.756
Hand him the keys
and say, "Go for it".

48:38.960 --> 48:42.669
If he can be assed to climb the steps,
lay me right here!

48:42.840 --> 48:45.035
You what?
What are you babbling about?

48:45.240 --> 48:47.959
Lay me here, roll me down.
What did you think?

48:48.040 --> 48:48.995
Oh, right.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.513
Check down below.

48:50.880 --> 48:54.111
If I'm still alive,
f*ck me, all three of you!

48:54.320 --> 48:56.914
Please! What are you saying
for God's sake?

48:57.200 --> 49:00.237
I'm picturing it.
It's too bad, me and Ýsmail Abi.

49:01.680 --> 49:03.796
Why me? Hey, why me?

49:04.720 --> 49:06.278
Don't make me crazy, Fikret!

49:06.560 --> 49:09.154
Look, I'd die anyway.
I said, if I don't die.

49:09.600 --> 49:11.272
You're all wired.

49:11.360 --> 49:15.069
Abi, you still don't get
how serious this is. Watch it!

49:15.280 --> 49:18.158
The guy up there isn't normal.
He's sick, a maniac.

49:18.280 --> 49:19.235
Just your type.

49:19.320 --> 49:20.673
Hah. Good.

49:21.440 --> 49:22.555
OK. In the name of God.

49:53.720 --> 49:56.109
Who are you? What's up?
Why are you here?

49:56.200 --> 49:59.112
No reason.
We were just passing.

49:59.680 --> 50:00.999
We're maniacs, right?

50:01.440 --> 50:03.476
Yilmaz!
We talked yesterday, right?

50:04.040 --> 50:05.758
You were gonna help us.

50:06.560 --> 50:07.788
Çeto!
Is that you?

50:07.960 --> 50:09.075
Yes, it's me.

50:09.520 --> 50:11.112
I didn't see you.
Step up front.

50:11.560 --> 50:12.515
Out of the way.

50:13.160 --> 50:14.388
Come in, c'mon.

50:19.280 --> 50:20.315
Mister...

50:20.640 --> 50:23.200
Did you build this lair up here...

50:23.520 --> 50:26.956
So we'd have time to think on the way
if we were getting cold feet?

50:27.320 --> 50:30.039
I just wasted my last breath
asking that question.

50:30.840 --> 50:33.229
I'm about to pass out.
Here goes.

50:33.720 --> 50:34.948
Oh my God, Fikret Abi!

50:35.600 --> 50:40.720
Fikret? Fikret!
Hey, did you pass out, Fikret?

50:41.480 --> 50:44.870
See that? If I pass out now,
they'll think I'm aping him.

50:45.320 --> 50:46.639
Too bad!

50:47.120 --> 50:49.554
You'd think there's no girls
in the village!

50:52.800 --> 50:54.392
Marsiye!
C'mon, we're going.

50:54.560 --> 50:57.233
Marsiye? Mum, that's a TV soap.
Her name’s Marika.

50:57.320 --> 51:00.790
Maybe it is, but my name's Hatice.
Nothing to be done.

51:01.000 --> 51:06.235
Tell her to come with us.
Say, "You're going with Mum and co".

51:07.440 --> 51:10.159
OK, Mum. I do speak Turkish.
For goodness sake!

51:15.760 --> 51:17.716
- Going where?
- Is Miss Mahpeyker asking?

51:17.880 --> 51:20.235
God, is it Mahpeyker now?
No, I'm asking.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.238
To drink soda!
God!

51:23.560 --> 51:25.551
C'mon then, let's do it!

51:27.000 --> 51:29.150
Oh my, look at you and that belly!

51:30.640 --> 51:32.995
Over here, dear.
C'mon, dance.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.032
OK, time to feed the girls.

51:37.120 --> 51:38.439
Here, honey.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.348
What, what?

51:40.440 --> 51:42.829
Here.
C'mon now, eat!

51:45.080 --> 51:46.479
Oh my God!

51:53.280 --> 51:56.158
So this isn't the way
to eat everything.

51:57.160 --> 51:58.752
Health is everything, dear.

52:06.760 --> 52:07.954
That isn't tap water.

52:08.120 --> 52:09.553
No, purified.
Made it myself.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.676
God knows what goes
in the tap water.

52:11.800 --> 52:12.869
Gotta purify it.

52:12.960 --> 52:13.949
God is great!

52:14.040 --> 52:15.393
No deliveries, huh?

52:15.520 --> 52:17.431
Who'd haul
5-gallon bottles up 95 steps?

52:17.560 --> 52:20.757
I wouldn't bring gas.
Delivery guys are human too.

52:20.960 --> 52:23.997
If I lived here, I'd never get bread.
I'd die of hunger.

52:24.120 --> 52:25.519
I make bread myself.

52:28.360 --> 52:29.634
Fikret Abi, OK.

52:29.800 --> 52:32.268
The trek here did you in.
Don't overdo it.

52:33.840 --> 52:34.795
Yilmaz!

52:34.920 --> 52:38.037
Aren't businesses like this
meant to be in basements?

52:39.440 --> 52:42.591
Son, we almost died
coming up those steps.

52:42.840 --> 52:45.035
How did you find it?
You were ripped off, son.

52:45.320 --> 52:46.275
Son?

52:48.080 --> 52:50.878
Run! Run for it, run!

52:53.000 --> 52:53.989
What's up with him?

52:54.200 --> 52:55.428
I'd be wrong to say.

52:55.880 --> 52:57.916
Yilmaz, it's OK.
A glass took a tumble.

52:58.120 --> 52:59.917
- Çeto, is that you?
- Yes.

53:03.280 --> 53:06.875
Then I'll take you all to the workshop
where I do my R&D.

53:07.040 --> 53:07.995
R&D?

53:10.240 --> 53:11.639
Faruk, talk to the girl.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.193
She calls your mum
Hatice Haným.

53:13.280 --> 53:16.795
Only your dad calls her 'missus'.
It upsets the woman.

53:17.240 --> 53:20.516
Please, Þengül Teyze.
She only has a few words of Turkish.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.676
Let her say what she likes.
Is 'Abla' better?

53:23.560 --> 53:25.312
You have your work cut out, dear.

53:25.440 --> 53:27.954
Once we're back in Istanbul
after the wedding...

53:28.040 --> 53:30.270
We'll only visit
once or twice a year.

53:30.320 --> 53:31.594
Istanbul?

53:31.800 --> 53:33.677
Isn't the firm abroad?

53:35.240 --> 53:38.550
Sure it is,
but we won't always be there.

53:38.640 --> 53:40.949
It works by appointment.
When they have the staff...

53:41.160 --> 53:43.196
Even the water,
it's like watery soda.

53:43.280 --> 53:46.397
So like, it's 7.00 there now.
Mum, what kept you so long?

53:46.560 --> 53:49.074
A skirt down to my knees
barely covers her bum.

53:49.200 --> 53:53.113
So I've no idea what she got.
But I did see two G-strings.

53:53.480 --> 53:54.833
Shame on you, Mum!

53:54.920 --> 53:57.036
Why? Does she understand
for heaven's sake?

53:57.120 --> 53:58.997
C'mon, let's go.
You as well.

54:04.440 --> 54:05.395
Hey!

54:05.880 --> 54:07.996
- Isn't that Ahmet Özhan? Wow!
- Fikret.

54:10.040 --> 54:12.679
The gold's here.
You'd never know it's fake.

54:12.920 --> 54:15.673
There's double-hardened steel
under the plating.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.997
It won't break, bend or buckle.

54:18.160 --> 54:22.199
It's a bit heavier than normal steel.
Here, feel the weight.

54:22.960 --> 54:26.316
- Yilmaz, we also need a camel.
- Haunch or fillet?

54:26.400 --> 54:28.789
No, not to eat.
For riding.

54:29.880 --> 54:32.269
I'll fix it.
I'll fix it, God willing.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.478
Weren't you an only child?

54:35.600 --> 54:38.273
Yilmaz looks so like you.
Are you brothers?

54:38.520 --> 54:40.351
That's an insult!
Brothers?

54:40.440 --> 54:42.874
Like my mum would give birth
to anything so ugly.

54:43.200 --> 54:45.998
If she shat,
it would be prettier.

54:46.080 --> 54:47.593
You only had to say no.

54:47.720 --> 54:48.709
What can I do, teacher?

54:49.000 --> 54:50.638
There's nothing I can't do.

54:50.880 --> 54:52.313
Oh God!

54:56.640 --> 54:59.552
I forged banknotes
not even ATMs could pick out.

54:59.760 --> 55:02.274
I sent the Central Bank some.
They were amazed.

55:02.960 --> 55:06.430
I was expecting an engraved plaque.
They gave me 4 years.

55:06.560 --> 55:07.549
If only you'd refused.

55:08.560 --> 55:09.709
Can you do that?

55:10.760 --> 55:12.079
No, you can't.

55:12.640 --> 55:13.755
Right.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.035
I'll find that camel.

55:17.120 --> 55:19.395
He's so like my late dad.

55:21.880 --> 55:23.438
Did you call me 'son'?

55:23.760 --> 55:24.715
No.

55:26.600 --> 55:27.999
It's as good as real.

55:28.360 --> 55:29.509
Where's technology going?

55:29.960 --> 55:33.236
He said not even ATMs could tell
his fake notes. Didn't you hear?

55:33.360 --> 55:35.476
If only we'd shelled out a bit more...

55:35.560 --> 55:39.314
And not got the cheap stuff.
This isn't great, Ýsmail Abi.

55:39.480 --> 55:40.435
Is it so obvious?

55:40.480 --> 55:43.233
I know lira notes
to have Atatürk's face on them.

55:43.400 --> 55:46.073
But this has
a full-length portrait.

55:47.360 --> 55:48.349
Give it here, Çeto.

55:49.960 --> 55:51.598
It's a full-length portrait.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.230
Not Atatürk either.
It's Kazým Karabekir.

55:55.520 --> 55:57.715
Mental Bank of Turkey.

56:01.280 --> 56:03.475
Ýsmail Abi, what's up?
Something's not OK.

56:03.600 --> 56:05.830
No. Just an important errand to do.

56:06.680 --> 56:09.433
I'll be back in half an hour.
I'll explain then.

56:09.840 --> 56:11.432
- Where's he going?
- How do I know?

56:31.320 --> 56:33.515
Weddings or funerals
are no place for bad blood.

56:35.840 --> 56:37.353
That's what I was taught.

56:37.440 --> 56:40.159
But invites don't go
to close family either.

56:40.360 --> 56:41.315
In the old days...

56:42.800 --> 56:46.713
People knew if they were in favor
from whether they got an invite.

56:47.360 --> 56:48.713
If you gave anyone invites...

56:50.520 --> 56:52.715
They'd get upset
and boycott the wedding.

56:53.160 --> 56:56.869
"Invited to our own wedding?"
They'd say, and refuse to go.

57:00.320 --> 57:03.517
Here, brother.
It's your invite.

57:05.720 --> 57:08.837
I'm your junior.
I've come to you out of respect.

57:10.680 --> 57:13.114
I got beyond
who's right and wrong.

57:14.240 --> 57:17.152
Brother, you're the only elder
in my boy's family.

57:18.160 --> 57:22.438
Read him a verse of the Koran.
Put a ring on his finger.

57:23.640 --> 57:25.995
Then let's dance like real men.

57:26.440 --> 57:28.158
For everyone to see.

57:37.560 --> 57:40.074
.
Preparations can start!

58:18.480 --> 58:19.435
There you go!

58:19.520 --> 58:23.069
THE BRIDE'S SIDE
LATVIA

58:29.280 --> 58:32.397
I called so many times, baby.
Why don't you answer?

58:32.680 --> 58:35.831
I didn't hear, honey.
It's kind of noisy here.

58:36.560 --> 58:38.312
The reception sucks anyway.

58:38.440 --> 58:40.795
Where exactly are you, baby?
I'm curious.

58:40.880 --> 58:42.393
In a village near Sivas.

58:42.880 --> 58:44.757
The wedding's tonight.
In a field.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.592
The name of Tank's village?

58:47.200 --> 58:49.634
It's called Esenyurt.

58:50.720 --> 58:53.439
Did Marika's family find out?
Are they mad?

58:53.880 --> 58:58.590
Well.
I guess they're a bit upset.

59:01.040 --> 59:03.759
We only escaped
thanks to you, babe.

59:03.920 --> 59:04.955
Rubbish.

59:05.200 --> 59:09.796
Nothing would've stopped you.
I didn't do anything.

59:10.160 --> 59:13.152
No way, honey.
You even paid for our flights.

59:13.240 --> 59:17.199
You took Marika's brothers out that night.
You did everything, my hero.

59:18.560 --> 59:23.475
No, stop.
You're playing with the truth.

59:23.760 --> 59:25.398
Honey, I'm hanging up.

59:25.880 --> 59:29.350
We forgot the chargers.
We could get cut off any second.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.511
How could you forget the chargers?

59:36.440 --> 59:38.237
You had it coming, Viktors.

59:43.160 --> 59:45.880
If we get there before
the marriage vows...

59:45.880 --> 59:49.350
...we can rescue the girl
and return her to her fiancé.

59:49.520 --> 59:55.390
And we'll spare your life
for helping us.

59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.673
If we don't get there in time,
her fiancé will kill you.

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.791
Go, get there before the wedding.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.358
What are you waiting for?

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:13.997
C'mon, run.
Get to the village before them.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.520
If those boys crash the
wedding, there'll be carnage.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.829
Better just you die
than a mass of people.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.118
I'll slowly get going then.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.435
Switch them on!

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.712
Oh my God!
We're talking dynamite.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.956
Hey, the camel's here!

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.359
The camel's here.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.077
- Tarik, Tarik!
- Yes, Dad?

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.198
Get up, son. The camel's here.
Look, the camel's here.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.396
Where did they find it?

01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.999
My God.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.595
Atta boy! Good work!

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.151
Just look at that, look at you.
Magnificent!

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.189
Bravo, my boy.
What a beauty of a camel.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.833
- Abi, what is this?
- A camel?

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.751
Is this a joke, Çetin Abi?

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:20.078
I said the same myself,
but your dad insists it's a tradition.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.597
The bride will climb on that camel
and ride from the house to the wedding.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.034
It's a tradition with us.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.270
A tradition with you?
Who are you?

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.070
I never heard of it.
I didn't ride a camel as a bride.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.630
Missus, you were rounder then.
We felt sorry for the camel.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.278
Ýsmail, the girl can't ride a camel.
She's educated.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.998
How'd she know about your traditions?

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.715
Hear that? I said "your" traditions.
We have nothing like that.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.957
Ýsmail Abi!
Ýsmail Abi. Wait for this!

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.878
What's up, teacher?
Did you mess up again?

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.388
No, nothing's wrong.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.515
Was that a camel?

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.475
God, it is.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.914
Çeto, what's this?

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.195
A camel.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.878
Are you taking the piss?
Dick!

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.793
God! Ýsmail Abi said get it,
so I got it.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.269
Why's everyone laying into me?

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.628
Quiet boy, quiet girl.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.716
My man's just invented
a new tradition.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.593
The bride rides a camel
to the wedding!

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.432
Weren't you welcoming guests?

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.477
OK, remember the lights we put up?

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.591
What, the big colored things?

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.239
The big colored ones.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.468
(Meaningless gabble)

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.870
If you don't know camel language,
don't confuse the beast.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.437
Abi, the lights blew the fuses.
Tarik knows about electrics, right?

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.514
Tarik. C'mon, please, son.
Go take a look at them.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.473
But be careful.
Don't get that suit dirty.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.955
Hey, Çeto!
Bring the camel over.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.473
Still on his camel trip.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.357
God help us!

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.471
Broke and going to the wedding
by camel!

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.713
<i>And so we did.</i>

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:08.037
<i>We went on ahead.
I fixed the fuses and put them back.</i>

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.719
<i>Twice I nearly died.</i>

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.794
<i>We felt sure
the disasters were now over.</i>

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.992
<i>But turns out that was hasty.</i>

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.756
Where did you get this camel?

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.310
Look at that smile.
I know you.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.950
C'mon, I won't tell.
Who did you nick it from?

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.875
I didn't, I borrowed it.
Ýsmail Abi didn't pay a cent either.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.192
He said it was tradition,
he wanted a camel, so I got one.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.431
- I shouldn't have?
- Get out of here!

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.590
It's not like taking a bike
for a spin.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.278
Borrow a camel?
My ass!

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.113
- Çeto, what's on the camel's butt?
- Oh God!

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.599
How do I know, Fikret Abi?

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.229
Why keep asking me about the camel?

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.795
Looks like a tick, Çeto.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.874
If it's a tick, get behind the beast,
grab the thing and pull it off!

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.189
Boy!

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.793
- Çeto, what did you do?
- Çeto!

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.109
- Çeto, do something!
- Çeto!

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.191
Get off my back!
Don't give me grief!

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.158
He brought the camel.
Why are you blaming me?

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.759
Do I run a camel farm?

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.671
Boys. You know what?

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.548
The bride's snatched the camel!
Run! Run!

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.993
- Hey!
- Run!

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.396
Çeto, I'm off to the wedding then.
You do the chasing.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.595
Thanks.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.114
No panic.
We'll have a great time.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.549
We'll have a great time.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.029
Let me kiss you.
We'll have a great time.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.749
We'll have a great time.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.115
No panic.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.949
No panic.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.877
No panic.
We'll have a great time.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.355
What's this?
A picnic spot or what?

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.798
Ýsmail Abi!

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.952
Hey... God, the camel!
No panic. No panic!

01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.155
Shh!

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.635
What?

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.234
Down below?

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.673
I'm on my way.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.233
- Nazmi Amca? What's up?
- Nature called.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.829
- How do you mean?
- What are you doing there?

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.151
I'm umm, reversing.
To do a running jump down below.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.559
- Why?
- Nazmi Amca.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.877
- There's this camel.
- Camel?

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.118
You don't get camels here!
Don't tease.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.555
I'm talking one hell of a camel.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.511
Hey. Hey! Hey!

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.874
Çeto! Wait!

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.758
The girl fell off.
Forget the camel.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.552
Don't make me crazy!

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.074
It's been "the camel" all day.
I'm brain dead.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.874
I fell all that way.
You know why?

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.155
Because of that damn beast.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.071
Watch your mouth!
Camels are sacred.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.993
Animals aren't divided
into sacred or unclean.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.389
Animals are animals.
They're all sacred.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.993
Stop!
The girl isn't moving.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.473
- Are you serious?
- What did you do?

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.192
Did you kill her?

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.874
Sure. I killed her.
That's my fault too.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:24.318
Think Hurricane Sandy in the US.
Çetin Yakut is the Sivas equivalent.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.274
Half an hour
we chased them.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.069
Her belly’s moving.
She's alive.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.235
Seriously?

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.596
She's alive.
You did it again, Çeto.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.189
You did it again.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.592
For the time being.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.276
Çetin, Çetin!

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.839
It's Nazmi Amca, relax.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.992
Is that a woman there?
You said there was a camel.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.548
Nazmi Amca, I'll explain later.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.672
Yilmaz, you got us
into this camel thing, so you...

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.195
I'm vibrating.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.473
It's Tarik.
They're high and dry there.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.670
- What do I tell him?
- Don't answer.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.751
- So I hit 'no'?
- Let's think on the way.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.875
Let's think.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.035
- Saffet.
- Huh?

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.798
- No sign of anyone, huh?
- No, Abi.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.036
It's crazy,
a camel snatching the bride.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.958
- Ah, they're here.
- Hah.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.751
My God!
What's taking them so long?

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.438
They're on their way.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.989
It's a camel, it's slow.
A horse would be faster.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.111
But everyone's waiting out there.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.430
And what's this?
Another of Dad's traditions?

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.078
Why are we holding hands?

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.229
That's a real tradition.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.436
A best man sticks by the groom
or he's kidnapped.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.079
- Who?
- The groom.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.194
So I got the beefiest boy in town
with the cutest smile as your guard.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.878
He has Kangal blood, he breaks backs
was top in the '99 college exams.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.910
But he's retarded. He marked the desk
instead of the answer sheet.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.233
No, look. That's too cozy.
Hold his wrist.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.276
Toraman.
Hold him like this.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.029
Why in hell would anyone kidnap me?
Get the f*ck off me!

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.993
- Why are you so keen?
- Don't. You upset the kid.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.879
- Toraman.
- Look, Kinyas.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.874
- Kin... You upset him. Kinyas.
- Toraman! Hey, it's OK.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.956
Should we have said?
I mean, she's his wife.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.474
She isn't.
There's still the wedding night.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.158
They'll find the bride.

01:08:18.279 --> 01:08:19.917
We have to do the wedding.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:21.548
We need jewelry.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.551
Or how will your loan get paid?

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.993
My loan, huh?

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.198
It was our loan in the bank.
Now it's mine, is it?

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.667
Exactly.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.871
The door's out front.
What's with the window?

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.229
Look what's here.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.197
Pull it open. Stand back.
Hand her over.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.988
- Hand her over.
- Careful.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.035
Oh God!

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.268
Is she dead?

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.276
We're f*cked, I swear we are!

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.751
Teacher! Shame on you!
An educated guy like you cursing?

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.518
C'mon, be a man!

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.710
Cool it.
She's passed out, not dead.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:06.828
How long for?

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:11.192
She just came round, saw two guys
carrying her and passed out again.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.636
This kind are frail,
not like village gals.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.758
The camel got cranky
and threw the girl off.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:17.755
Hah.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.832
- So camels aren't used to Slavs.
- And Slavs to camels.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.069
And she banged her head falling.
Like so.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.116
- So forget cause and effect.
- Hey, OK.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:27.835
C'mon, come in.

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.919
In the name of God.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.115
Çetin!

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.029
Where's the camel?

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.439
For the love of God!

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.035
What in hell do we do now?
They're waiting for the bride.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.276
We discussed that on the way.
Huh, Yilmaz?

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:42.679
He did, not me.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.872
Thanks, Yilmaz. I say
we stick the dress on the bridesmaid.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.917
There's the veil, gloves too.
Right, Yilmaz?

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.911
Novel idea.
Never heard it before.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.479
Thanks, Yilmaz.
What do you say?

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.353
I cornered the bridesmaid one day
to try my luck.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.677
But she has no Turkish either.
How do you explain?

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.990
That's for her escort
to the bridal bed. Tank.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.075
So that's OK.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.275
Who's gonna tell Tarik?

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.756
We just spent all day
chasing the camel's ass.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.195
Didn't you tell the groom yet?
Huh?

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.000
No!
What were we supposed to say?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:10.958
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
No!
What were we supposed to say?

01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:11.360
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.989
"Sorry, the camel snatched the bride.
These things happen. "
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:14.989 --> 01:10:15.360
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.592
"Camels run, they get tired, etc. "
Man, you have weird traditions!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:19.592 --> 01:10:19.800
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.000
What is it with camels?
Never heard of f*cking wedding cars?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:22.997
What is it with camels?
Never heard of f*cking wedding cars?

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.231
See? He's a natural.
You can't get it out. It sounds bad.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.438
Forget telling Tarik now.

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.518
Look, Ýsmail's flying.
How can I say the wedding's off?

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.477
How can I wreck it for him?

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.635
Aah!

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.719
That was the devil's work.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.275
Nice.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.993
I'm only putting up with this crap
for Ýsmail Abi, I swear.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.869
He's so like my late dad.
A carbon copy.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.509
Hey, OK.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.394
I'll wear the dress.
Put it on me.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.754
Don't make me crazy, please.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.719
You want to breathe your last
dancing in Tank's arms?

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.795
Yes.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.117
Plus that dress is tight.
It's for someone thin, not you or me.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.189
Uh-uh.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:17.839
Forget Ýsmail Abi,
if my own dad rose from the dead...

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.232
And refused me his blessing,
he still couldn't me in that dress.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.319
I wasn't in a suit at my own wedding
so you think I'd wear a bride's dress?

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.391
I'm gonna talk big.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.833
Impale me with the biggest stick...

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.038
And I still wouldn't wear it!
Never! Never!

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.911
- I would, but I have a beard.
- I won't.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.917
I would,
but I can't dance.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.276
- I'll wear it.
- If I didn't have a beard...

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.869
- I won't wear it!
- I'll dance once, it's OK.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.873
I'll wear it!

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.278
Hands higher!

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.349
Who said that?

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.909
Who said that?

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.312
Under watch
even at your own wedding.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.553
- Is it finished?
- Yes, teacher. But so am I.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.992
Didn't peek at her, did you?

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:53.157
Mum changed her clothes.
I just helped. Happy now?

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.069
Ýshak Amca!
It's Ýsmail Abi's brother.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.069
Did he ask him?

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.278
Oh my goodness!
Ýsmail, your brother's here.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.795
- Abi, welcome.
- Thanks.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.637
- Marvelous!
- Welcome, brother.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.950
- Welcome, Abla.
- Thank you.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:16.394
Marvelous. What a good match.
May God keep them together.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:23.511
My uncle and his wife are here.
They haven't spoken in ages.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.951
Honey? You're all tense.
Is it nerves?

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.235
What's he saying?

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.352
Great dancing from Yilmaz there.
Just like a dame!

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.831
He's a real scam.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.438
OK, dance over.
I'll nip out and check around.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.318
The cake, drinks and stuff.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:47.275
Right? They're so important.
Go check them out. Move!

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.754
Something's up with you today.
But wait, honey.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:02.229
Let's get the wedding over
and I'll melt away that stress.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.358
Fuck you! Fuck off!

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.274
What's going on, son?

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.913
Someone taught her to swear.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.197
Dammit, she probably thinks
she was saying something cute.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.629
For God's sake.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.155
Taxi!

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.080
Let's go.
C'mon, make it snappy.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.679
Okey turist, good.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.875
Good. Let's go.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.749
Let's go.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.551
Hold it.
We're going to HQ. Hold it.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.398
Why HQ, huh?

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.915
I tell you I saw a camel,
you tell me HQ.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.275
It came out of nowhere.
I swerved and crashed.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.675
- Ýshak Amca, selam aleykum.
- Aleykum selam.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.515
OK, eat up. Like the cake?
Is it good?

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.234
Yes. But maybe
a bit too much cream.

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.069
No, c'mon. It's just right.
I made it with my own hands.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.275
Have some lemonade.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.355
Good for you.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.799
Weren't you reformed, Çetin?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.797
I never see you at the mosque.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.953
I don't go in the village.
I fell out with the imam.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.470
We aren't on good terms.

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.438
I'll help patch things up.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.712
I'm not at war,
just making a stand.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.119
He's slow at prayers.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.839
The main mosque laps us
at Ramadan prayers.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.679
It got to me.
I cornered him in the courtyard.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.432
I said,
OK, read the Falaq and Naas.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.913
Read the Ikhlas.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.356
But you always go for
the Shams and Ibrahim suras.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.634
It's not on, I said.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.395
Ýshak Amca?

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.075
Ýshak Amca?

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.789
Amca?

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.035
Oh no!

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.593
In the name of God.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.199
Ýshak Amca.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.758
Amca?
Let's check your pulse.

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.949
No pulse.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.748
Ýshak Amca.
Amca, have some lemonade.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.429
Hey, hey.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.228
Abad dance, no.
A lot of vodka, yes.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.752
Amca drinks like a fish.
Don't mind him.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.869
Ýshak Amca.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.034
What are you staring at?
May God forgive him.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.318
His time was up.
That was it.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.118
Is this a joke, asshole?

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.959
You danced with him for hours.
How's he dead?

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.439
He was dead before dancing.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.835
He died eating cake.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.231
Dragging him through the crowd
would turn heads, I figured.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.157
So I got him dancing.
Was that so bad?

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.429
Great idea.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.074
How could you, teacher?
We have dead in here.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.511
Maybe the living are afraid.
I'm human too, I'm scared.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.075
Amca!

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.119
Çetin, what do we do now?

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.398
- Fikret Abi, I say I should go.
- Go where?

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.028
To Tokat.
I have family there.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.435
I'll get into livestock.
It's my destiny.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.636
And we obviously
won't get the jewelry.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.239
Oh, and we have a corpse.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:48.114
You won't catch me
if I beat it out of here.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.311
Let me give you this
for the journey, wait.

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.914
Thanks, Abi.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.917
- Abi?
- Drop the f*cking Abi. A single bullet.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.793
I'll shoot.
Bang!

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:07.438
And under clause 2, paragraph 3,
article 86 of the Turkish Penal Code...

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:11.150
I'll spend 6 months in jail.
Only that's a lie.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.555
Why?

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.918
Because.
46 C.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.191
I've more power than the FBI.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:22.111
I'd shoot you without blinking,
walk away and not even look back.

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.879
You're in front of me, see?

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.716
Rear sight, eye, front sight.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.515
So what do we do?

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.879
Selam aley...

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:45.510
Marika, Viktors is here.
It's a complete surprise.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.111
Welcome, honey.
Do you have the charger?

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.549
It's still the charger?!

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.149
Here, go charge.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.915
Baby, we're over. Screw the charger,
they could show up any time.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:04.955
Who?

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.998
The groom. I mean the real groom
and Marika's brothers.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:14.756
There's nothing else for it.
We have to kidnap the bride.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.915
Viktors!

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.918
How can I repay you?
You couldn't stay away, huh?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.115
What a great guy!

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.475
Brother! My brother!
You're the best!

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.109
What are you doing?

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:28.916
Behave! What will they think of you?
For heaven’s sake!

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.715
Oh my!

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.032
Did we call the gendarmes?

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.474
I should've run for it.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.069
You think they realized?

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.918
Do they know
Ýshak Amca's dead?

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.752
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.429
- Welcome.
- Are you the wedding hosts?

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.875
Yes, that's us.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.269
There's a problem.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.509
What's that?

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.518
The gendarmes mustn't come in here.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.119
If they do,
they mustn't see.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.550
If they see,
I'll shoot the lot.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.520
- I'll walk away and not...
- Abi, please.

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:07.116
- Rear sight, eye...
- No glasses. I dropped my glasses.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.950
I'll show you glasses.
Move! Go!

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.512
The kids nabbed the money
off the floor and went spending.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:16.188
Why would we have fake money,
commander?

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.873
We need to search the guests.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.680
You can't! Tongues will wag.
How do we explain?

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:26.234
They'll say we called you in
to search everyone for wedding loot.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.076
You found it on the dance floor.
The money is Çeto's. C'mon!

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.875
Yes, it's mine.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:48.672
Search me. Let's go, commander.
Can't run from justice.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.033
- What are you doing?
- Helping justice, Fikret Abi.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.389
Which means?
I'll do my punishment.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.552
So the wedding won't break up.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:01.071
Fikret Abi, the wedding's over to you.
Have a great time.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.635
Look at Çetin.
Talk about selfless.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.150
Asshole, run off and dump me
with the crap. You owe me.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.513
Where's the registrar?
Let's get this thing over.

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.875
How did the guy die?

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.675
That's the main thing.
Çeto said he had cake.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.874
What if he got poisoned by the cake?
What if all the guests die?

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.676
- Should we cancel the thing?
- It's almost over, Fikret Abi.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.273
It may be a sign from above.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.557
For God's sake, when did you ever
care about signs from above?

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.559
- I'm screwed and you just dump me!
- But look at us!

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:43.356
If my parents hear about the loan,
they'll disown me.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.276
This wedding has to go on for me,
for Saffet, the village teacher!

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.708
Hey, OK. Relax.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.194
The wedding goes on.

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.708
Don't get upset.
C'mon.

01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.711
Follow me.
Saffet, follow me.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.990
Tell Tank some fib.
We're going.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.559
What's up, honey?

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.757
Tarik, we're just off to the bathroom.
We'll be right back.

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:16.869
Sure, go ahead.

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:21.277
But don't be long, honey.
The registrar will be here any minute.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.272
- What's going on?
- LADIES

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.591
Your guy's here, in Sivas.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.269
Don't you hear me?
Say something!

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.313
They'll kill you!
Tank too, if you tell him.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.631
- What's happening to me?
- Let's escape through there, c'mon.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:51.476
If they don't find us,
no one will get hurt.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.239
- Selam aleykum.
- Aleykum selam, son.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.159
- How's the cake?
- A bit too much cream perhaps.

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.632
- Praise the Lord! How are you, son?
- Fine, thanks. I'm well.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.472
Have you seen Ýshak, son?

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.875
Ýshak Amca?
Yes. Yes. Yes, I did.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.151
Just now, dancing.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.275
He seemed a bit dazed.
Huh, Teyze?

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:24.029
- I wonder if something's wrong?
- No, what could be wrong?

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.474
I don't know.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.875
He seemed a bit pale.
He had no color.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.470
It's the light, dear.
His cholesterol's OK, no diabetes.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.119
- His heart?
- What's the matter?

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.111
Did he have heart problems?

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.793
Not even tooth decay.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.873
I have a bad heart, blood sugar,
blood pressure problems, everything.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:45.318
But Ýshak is fit as a fiddle.
He eats so much though.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.672
Eating a lot is OK.

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.072
Did he have
silent heart disease?

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.679
The kind that...

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.870
I can't keep quiet any longer.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.116
Be strong.
We've lost Ýshak Amca.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.916
He just dropped dead.
We carried him inside to avoid a fuss.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:04.234
Well, no use crying over spilled milk.
Be strong, Teyze.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.709
We're all upset.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.029
I cried.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.916
Everyone had tears in their eyes.

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.554
Then the jewelry scam
to land 20,000 lira...

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.235
Teyze!

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.914
Lord, are You
putting us to the test?

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.673
F*ck this, enough!

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.749
OK, you're one of us.
On the way with the camel...

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.029
Saffet!

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.758
- Did you rat on us?
- What do you mean?

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.637
I told Þengül Teyze everything.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:00.194
She knew most of it anyway.
Was it so bad?

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.112
So what's she doing here?

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.874
I was explaining things
and it just happened.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.239
She passed away.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.475
Passed away?

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.796
She's dead?
So how did she die?

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.515
Well, last thing she did
was eat cake.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.795
Çetin messed up the cake.
Where's Çetin?

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.355
Çetin!

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.109
- He's at the police station.
- Doing what?

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.835
Umm, well...
He was kind of arrested.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.155
Çetin!

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.148
The bridesmaid!

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.679
Hand her over.

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.275
Hold tight.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.555
What happened?

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.511
Search me.
She talks weird.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.478
She kept babbling.
First I was quiet.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:45.275
She led me to the forest.
I showed my face and knocked her out.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.595
Her head’s bleeding.

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:48.512
Þengül Teyze!
Why are you here?

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.392
- She knows.
- I'll tell then.

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.790
I had a hard time knocking her out.

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.434
Blood's normal.
I hit her more than once.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:59.477
Oh God!
Oh my God!

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.752
There's blood on my dress!

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.673
My adorable dress!
What do we do, Þengül Teyze?

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.070
Good heavens,
is it the color or what?

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.914
You threw toy money at kids
to look rich?

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.630
It's from being poor, commander.
I messed up so forgive me.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.870
I did my army service
as a gendarme.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.518
- You have a tough job.
- Where were you for army service?

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.709
Here, in Sivas.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.156
I've been here 10 years
and never seen you. Which intake?

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:27.199
Intake?
Commander, I have to answer this.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.919
Sorry, it may be important.
You know the story.

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.309
Hello?

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:34.750
- Çetin, where are you?
- At the gendarmerie, Mum. You know.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:35.955
Drop dead!

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.075
Oh my God.

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.718
OK, Mum,
but I'm in a fix right now.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.273
<i>Come back.
Make an excuse.</i>

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.913
- Ishak's wife is dead too.
- My God!

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.035
What happened?

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.596
Yilmaz beat up the bride's friend.
The girl's face is a mess.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.678
The bridesmaid?
They tried suede, umm, you know.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:54.308
To knock her out!
Why would I beat her up?

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.032
C'mon, come back fast.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.118
Oh, woe is me!

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.593
Where were we?

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.436
Commander, I just lied to you.
I didn't do army service.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.636
I said I did it here
to get sympathy.

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.954
I'm a draft dodger.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.270
But I dodged flawlessly
for21 years.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.437
So today's the day.
Recruit me.

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:20.351
What do you say?
Let me be of use to the nation.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.116
Why was the commander so mad?
All I did was confess.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.872
And take the piss?
Shame on you at your age!

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.673
For heaven’s sake.

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.232
Where did I put it?

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.431
I wanted to ask you, youngst...

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.397
We messed up.
Here, fire away.

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:45.678
I was about to ask for a light.
So smoking does shorten your life.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.749
Explain, Fikret.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.752
The girl fell off the camel.

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:51.076
The dress only fitted Yilmaz.
Go on.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.992
When Ýshak Amca dropped dead...

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:56.476
You told his wife and she died.
Saffet told her for sure.

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.154
Anyway you can't
bring back the dead. Go on.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.195
This girl?

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.914
She found out who I was
so I hamstringed her.

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.753
Are you Spider Man? Nut!
What's with the hands?

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.509
I saw, heard and know nothing.
All I have is one son.

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:11.835
It's his wedding.
I want no scenes.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:12.955
Fix this.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.596
I'm going to put on more lipstick.
Now fix this. For heaven's sake!

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.069
Sharp lady.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.471
Learned to read in 4 days.
She's sharp.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.554
Where were you, honey?
The registrar's almost here.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.550
Marika, where's your man?

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:48.116
Tank, is she upset with me?
Why won't she talk to me?

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.234
Tarik, run!

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:53.995
What's going on?

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.795
Selam aleyküm.

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.235
Hands off!

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:03.990
Fikret.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.232
Who are you bashing,
f*cking paleface?

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.994
Fikret.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.915
Saffet.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.594
Boy, does he bash!
Run!

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.235
Asshole Saffet.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:23.359
F*ck it!
What is this?

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.879
What's the scam?

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.995
God, that's ugly.

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:29.232
- What's going on?
- Who are those guys?

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.034
Yilmaz Abi, how come
you're in the bride's dress?

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.879
- You answer. Mine's a long story.
- Mine's longer.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.156
The camel snatched the bride.
She fell off and passed out.

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.273
So I wore the dress. And we lost
your aunt and uncle. My condolences.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.552
The camel snatched the bride?

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.473
Your uncle's dead
and you wait for the bride!

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.479
Why are the guys chasing us?
What do they want?

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.359
To kill us.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.556
They'll pump bullets
like perfume spray.

01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:01.117
Why didn't you say so from the start?
Run, man! Run!

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.475
Ah, Marika!

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.873
Þengül Teyze, I put Ýsmail Abi
and Fikret Abi in there.

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.669
I told people drunk relatives had
kidnapped the groom, it's tradition.

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.757
Otherwise they'd panic.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.873
God, in the name of God!

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:19.709
Fikret Abi!

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.633
Oh God, what did I do?

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.308
Forgive me, God!

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.516
Forgive me, God.
Fikret Abi.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:27.829
Ýsmail Abi.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.393
Oh my God, Ýsmail Abi!

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.076
Ýsmail Abi!

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:33.514
Abi, what did we do?

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:36.558
Abi, what's happening?
Here, one last kiss.

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:38.512
- Çetin Abi?
- Oh my God!

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.275
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.429
How did they die?

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.750
Those girls came here from Latvia
to die?

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:48.959
<i>- It was the cake, wasn't it?
- They aren't dead, just passed out.</i>

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.798
- The bridesmaid?
- Passed out too.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:51.949
Ýshak Amca and his wife?

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.395
They're dead.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.115
Are you stoned?
You hauled him here alone.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.596
Who beat them up?

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.437
We're finished, Tank.

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.679
I never thought of my dress
as a burial shroud.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:11.515
Abi, what do we do?

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.189
I hear noises.

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.469
They're coming.

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.113
We have to run, Tank.
Run!

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.679
Wait. Hold it.

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:19.829
Where's a rock?

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.349
I set up a decoy.

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.033
C'mon, up the tree.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.437
- They're coming, Tank. Quick.
- I'll hold the train then.

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:33.948
No need.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.837
If only I'd gone up first.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:50.233
Oof! That was him jumping!

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.352
Man, who are these guys?

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.598
You know, if you'd been friends
it would've been handy.

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.194
Abi, don't look,
but they're looking at us.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.238
- What did he say?
- Come down.

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.594
What did you say?

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.789
I said...

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.795
What's going on?
It's the devil!

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.715
Yilmaz Abi, I said,
"Come get us yourself if you can".

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.557
I see.
No need.

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.554
Hey!
So you decide!

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:30.319
40 mules, 40 cleavers
or 40 cm of shlong?

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:35.708
They don't know Turkish. You translate.
No wait, I'll translate them to hell!

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.118
Am I early?
Where is everyone?

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:32.713
Come here.
C'mon, come here!

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.834
It's all your fault! Asshole!
If you'd come 1 hour earlier.

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.394
You know how many people are dead?

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.194
- A camel ran out in front of me.
- So?

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:47.111
- I swerved and crashed into a tree.
- Fucker!

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.158
Come here.
You're fucked.

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:53.949
You too!

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:55.795
And you!

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.309
And you!
And you!

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:03.198
All except you, blondie.
Now you...

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.559
OK, let go.
Let go.

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.552
Take a look and sign.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:21.431
It was my first time back in years.
And only for you.

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:24.600
<i>It's not the place you miss
but the people in it.</i>

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:27.068
<i>Fikret Abi gets fired up
faster than you ever saw.</i>

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:30.272
<i>We went on ahead.
I fixed the fuses and put them back.</i>

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.230
You almost did it, kiddo.
Bad luck, that's all.

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.080
- Çetin Abi, please. Not now.
- You're right.

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.319
He shoots
and it's a goal!

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:45.074
Çeto, please.
It's not the time or place.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.275
You're right.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.838
He had a dickey heart, kept it quiet.
A silent heart thing.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:58.392
And his wife,
she was sick from head to toe.

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.750
They both passed on together.

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.997
Nurten had twins last night.

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.794
She's called one Ýshak,
the other Hamiyet.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.714
True, they're girls, so one
gets a raw deal. But that's life.

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.037
I'm not laughing!

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.555
No, no.

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.995
So you snatched the girl, huh?

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.993
Let's say we ran away.

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.433
It was her fiancé
who beat your poor dad, huh?

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.073
Yes, Abi.

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.674
So the girl having no family etc was...

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.119
- Lies too, Abi.
- Right?

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.270
Tarik, did you really
finish college?

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.637
- Yes, Dad.
- Phew.

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.714
But I didn't do a master's.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.839
I lied when college
dragged on for2 years.

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.149
Good for you.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.756
Pity my glasses, not him.
They were my only reminder of Dad.

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.833
Please say something
before I lunge at him.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.194
Tank.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.709
Come outside with me.
We don't want a scene during prayers.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.994
- Did you trip him, Fikret Abi?
- Yes.

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:10.188
Now look, Tank.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.348
A real father has his son circumcised,
sends him to school and the army...

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:16.875
Then does his wedding.
That's our way.

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.357
I won't have this village accuse me
of not giving my son a wedding!

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.072
Home's become a house of mourning.
We can't do jollity for a while.

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.948
It would be wrong.

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:32.073
Now here.
The keys to the car.

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:34.719
What car?

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:37.554
Yilmaz's.

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:41.880
I offered him a spare
but he said he'd get it working.

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.519
He's a professional.
And a man of his word.

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:47.114
He's so like my late dad.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.520
Hey, don't translate that!

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.790
Here. These are your plane tickets.
And this is what's left of the money.

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.315
Spend it on the wedding, OK?

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.200
But don't put in
any money of your own.

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:06.910
Only spend that much
on the wedding.

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:10.438
Wait a second, Dad.
I'm lost. Markus and co?

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:13.911
You know Çetin Abi.
He's a bit slow.

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.709
When there's a fight
he's an Ottoman routing the infidel.

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.868
So when he found out
they were real infidels, he showed off.

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:26.637
The doctor said
he'd pounded them like animals.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:31.789
Markus and co will be on baby food
fora while. They can't chew.

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.551
They still have all their teeth,
but the mechanism is kaput.

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:39.195
Dad, you are a true man.

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.389
Come here.

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.430
- Thanks a lot.
- Take care.

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:50.230
Don't worry about the others.
I'll fudge something...

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:54.758
And find a way to explain.
Don't you worry. Now off you go.

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:04.638
C'mon, out. You aren't needed now.
Out, c'mon. I'll translate.

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.359
OK, see you!

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.551
3 YEARS LATER
ISTANBUL

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.314
Emel! Emel! Emel!

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.429
Emel.

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:21.714
- Sayýn.
- Haným.

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.074
- Emel Sayýn Haným!
- Saffet?

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.309
Emel Abla.

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:27.392
Saffet, I don't believe it!
Dearest!

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.993
Where have you been?

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.316
You never call
to ask how I am.

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.238
I called a ton of times.
Aren't you family?

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:37.992
I was gonna ask if you'd come
for Ýsmail Abi's wedding in Sivas.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.076
Of course I'd have come, Saffet.

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:45.194
It's OK, Emel Haným.
Don't worry.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:48.352
The couple married in Latvia.
They work in Istanbul now.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.556
And they had a son.
I'm Fikret.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.275
Saffet is like a son
and Sivas my sun.

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.478
- Thanks, Fikret.
- Emel Haným, let me take those hands.

01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.793
Forgive my friends for being weird.
It's the first time they saw a star.

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.395
Ýsmail Abi says it's a tradition.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:05.909
With us it's granddads
who handle circumcision dos.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.269
That's how we were taught.

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:11.712
So our youngster has his circumcision.
You'll come sing a song, won't you?

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:14.275
And that way
you'll make up with Saffet.

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.237
Of course I'll come.

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.876
I'll be there.
So when is it?

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:20.269
When, Abi?

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:21.914
Soon.
