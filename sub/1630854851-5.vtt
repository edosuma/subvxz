I don't know, I've just learned
to not stress over

26:06.399 --> 26:08.307
The things that
I can't control.

26:08.401 --> 26:11.627
- Ah. I'm looking forward to
seeing you just

26:11.645 --> 26:13.571
Kind of being boss lady.
- Ok.

26:13.722 --> 26:15.055
- I want to see you
in your business

26:15.074 --> 26:16.740
'cause you're so wrapped up
and enthralled in it.

26:16.892 --> 26:18.133
It's been your world
for the last--

26:18.152 --> 26:18.984
- I was doing payroll
this morning.

26:19.136 --> 26:20.469
- Yeah.

26:20.562 --> 26:21.895
- Maybe you can help me
calm down

26:21.914 --> 26:23.806
And not work as much.

26:23.824 --> 26:25.474
I've been looking for
a little vice.

26:25.492 --> 26:26.809
I don't really love to drink

26:26.827 --> 26:28.419
Or go out.
- Anything?

26:28.570 --> 26:29.587
- Maybe my vice will
just be adventure.

26:29.814 --> 26:32.072
- Ok. It's not a bad one
to be addicted to.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.907
- I think so.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.242
- That's what I kind of love
about stuff like this, is,

26:36.262 --> 26:38.337
You know, maybe this is
the path that's less traveled.

26:38.489 --> 26:39.504
- Yeah.

26:39.657 --> 26:41.748
- But I like things to be
a mystery

26:41.767 --> 26:44.827
And like, you know, untouched.
- I'm not--I'm not shocked.

26:44.845 --> 26:46.586
- Untainted.
- Yeah, you love to like,

26:50.092 --> 26:51.834
- Mysterious,
what's gonna happen.

26:51.927 --> 26:53.259
- But that's like, life though.
- I'm a little more structured.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.503

26:54.521 --> 26:56.521

- Yeah.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.841
You know, I like to go down
the path least traveled,

- Old nicole was
drinking a lot.

30:06.030 --> 30:08.806
I was pretty selfish

30:08.957 --> 30:11.141

33:14.493 --> 33:15.826
- What?

33:16.053 --> 33:17.143
You weren't attracted to me,

- To your bald head.

But once I, you know, continue
to spend time with you,

33:26.563 --> 33:28.730
I definitely feel
a little bit more

33:28.749 --> 33:30.415
Attracted to you.

33:30.567 --> 33:33.659
- Honestly, I did feel awkward

like, placing her hand

33:48.694 --> 33:49.693

- more time.

patient with me, though.

The connection,
and the chemistry.

34:23.637 --> 34:26.121
- Like, the--the forehead?

34:26.139 --> 34:27.731
- Yeah. I like when you
kiss me on my forehead.

34:27.882 --> 34:29.140
I think that's sweet.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.385
Does it make you feel
less connected to me?

34:32.404 --> 34:33.812
- Sometimes I feel like
it's a push-off.

34:33.964 --> 34:35.572
- Yeah?
- Like I feel like,

34:35.723 --> 34:37.299
You're trying to--
it's a guard up

34:37.317 --> 34:38.891
That you're trying to, like,
"no, I don't want to

34:38.985 --> 34:40.318
Cross that boundary yet."

34:40.412 --> 34:42.971
- It's not shaquille.
It's--it's definitely me.

34:43.064 --> 34:45.731
Like, I can be
very affectionate,

34:45.751 --> 34:47.918
<i> But I've never been big</i>
<i> on kissing.</i>

34:48.145 --> 34:50.161
But we're--
we're working on all of that.

34:50.314 --> 34:52.647
It takes some baby steps
for me, sometimes.

34:52.740 --> 34:54.407
So we're taking baby steps.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.835
We have our intimate moments.
- Yeah.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.096
- So holding hands,
that's intimate for me.

34:59.247 --> 35:00.505
- Yeah, it's physical touch,
is real.

35:00.657 --> 35:02.248
- Yeah, physical touch.
So I love that.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.158
- I think we both have that.
- I like--

35:03.251 --> 35:04.993
I think I like physical touch

35:05.086 --> 35:06.103
More than kissing, honestly.

35:06.254 --> 35:07.662
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:07.755 --> 35:09.422
Like, even now, I'm on you.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.941
- Yeah, like, every time
we're together,

35:11.168 --> 35:12.609
It's kind of like,
we have to touch.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.594
It's a sense of security.
- It is.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.928
- Like, to make sure,
like, I got you.

35:16.022 --> 35:17.280
- And I love that feeling.

35:17.507 --> 35:20.342
- Yeah.
- I love feeling secure, so.

35:20.435 --> 35:22.344

- Mm-hmm.

35:22.437 --> 35:23.603

36:36.770 --> 36:40.513

in a relationship

36:42.517 --> 36:43.608
Since I started my business.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.368
But before, it's almost like,

36:45.520 --> 36:48.521
I would feel almost bad.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.540
It's like,
I was almost doing too much.

36:50.692 --> 36:53.768
Or like,
this person felt inferior

36:53.787 --> 36:57.455
'cause I was, like,
going after dreams.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.441
And it was, like, bringing out
their insecurities.

- Lavender.

Their favorite
sexual position...

39:08.572 --> 39:11.014

- is downward facing dog?

39:11.165 --> 39:13.850

it also translates into sex.

39:14.001 --> 39:16.836
- Airris. I cannot.

39:16.930 --> 39:18.930
- That's a little-known fact.
- Is that really a known fact?

39:19.082 --> 39:20.005
Or did you make it up
right now?

39:20.100 --> 39:21.340
- It's a known fact.

39:21.434 --> 39:24.361
I'm not saying it's true.

it's taboo.

I'm just a little more modest

hone in on who we really are.

55:15.871 --> 55:18.555

me in school,

55:18.707 --> 55:19.982

55:20.209 --> 55:21.542
And the many talents
that I have...

55:21.635 --> 55:23.819
- Mm-hmm.
- But it often lead us

55:24.046 --> 55:26.563
To just talking about me.
- Right. I agree.

55:26.715 --> 55:29.474

open up your heart

who you really are.

55:36.334 --> 55:38.834

the pandemic or what happened,

55:38.985 --> 55:43.822
But I just became closed off
a little bit, to myself.

55:43.841 --> 55:47.676
I would say, like, one thing
that I would need from you

55:47.828 --> 55:52.255
Is to continue to be, like,
emotionally connected with me.

55:52.408 --> 55:55.500
Because I'm just used to
being so independent.

55:55.594 --> 55:58.020
So now that I have you,

55:58.247 --> 56:00.247
I can lean on you
a little bit more.

56:00.340 --> 56:03.083
Just having that
emotional support

56:03.102 --> 56:05.343

things for me, as well,

56:05.437 --> 56:07.437
To receive from you.

56:07.531 --> 56:10.181
- I want you to be more
intentional with yourself.

56:10.201 --> 56:12.426
I always say,
you got one life to live.

56:12.519 --> 56:15.095

56:15.114 --> 56:18.615
We've poured so much into
others through our lives.

56:18.767 --> 56:20.358

where I get joy,

56:20.378 --> 56:22.603
And you know, even with
my, like, mentees.

56:22.696 --> 56:24.955

56:25.049 --> 56:29.292

you've grown, you've matured,

56:29.445 --> 56:32.613

you never imagined you being,

56:32.631 --> 56:34.281
That brings me so much joy.

56:34.374 --> 56:36.116

for you.

as your husband,

talk to me.

57:00.584 --> 57:02.309

57:07.091 --> 57:09.332
Because I want the answer
to be, like, perfect.

57:09.485 --> 57:11.242

57:11.262 --> 57:13.244

the over-thinker in me.

57:13.338 --> 57:14.930
But, it's ok, like--

57:15.157 --> 57:16.173

are perfect.

that you have to do that.
