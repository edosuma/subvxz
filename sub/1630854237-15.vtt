WEBVTT

00:16.119 --> 00:18.052
- Who else has seen these?
- Nobody.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.710
Uh, well, Carina.

00:20.710 --> 00:22.470
I need every name.
Who else?

00:22.470 --> 00:24.852
That's it.
Just us and Carina.

00:24.852 --> 00:26.578
She brought them to me,

00:26.578 --> 00:28.959
and we agreed
to bring them to you, so--

00:28.959 --> 00:30.547
so you could get ahead of it.

00:30.547 --> 00:31.755
Get ahead of it.

00:31.755 --> 00:33.136
Yeah, keep them
from coming out.

00:33.136 --> 00:35.104
Deny it's you, deny it's him.

00:35.104 --> 00:36.588
Say they're from when you
knew each other years ago.

00:36.588 --> 00:39.246
We--we can think of something,
but we have to fix this.

00:39.246 --> 00:40.626
This isn't
your problem, Herrera.

00:40.626 --> 00:42.076
We--

00:42.076 --> 00:45.976
The department can't afford
to lose you, Chief.

00:45.976 --> 00:47.840
I've been around FD
my entire life,

00:47.840 --> 00:51.499
and I never thought
I'd see a woman in charge,

00:51.499 --> 00:54.606
much less a woman of color
who kicks ass.

00:54.606 --> 00:56.746
I can't afford to lose you.

00:59.714 --> 01:01.992
Well, this is the smoking gun
you've been waiting for.

01:01.992 --> 01:03.270
Why aren't you using it?

01:03.270 --> 01:05.099
What other angle are
you playing here?

01:05.099 --> 01:07.239
No angle. Last time I tried
playing an angle,

01:07.239 --> 01:08.999
it nearly destroyed my life.

01:08.999 --> 01:10.449
I understand
why it'd be hard to trust me--

01:10.449 --> 01:11.899
Look, she came to me
because she was trying

01:11.899 --> 01:13.038
to do the right thing.

01:16.386 --> 01:18.940
Well, I thank you both.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.356
You should be getting to shift.

01:20.356 --> 01:22.461
I'm actually taking
a personal day today.

01:22.461 --> 01:24.256
Noted.
I will take this from here.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.952
And, lieutenants...

01:30.952 --> 01:33.852
I would rather be the one
to tell him.

01:37.925 --> 01:39.444
Herrera.

01:40.686 --> 01:42.619
Yes, Chief.

01:49.833 --> 01:51.732
I know you want to tear him
a new one for lying to you.

01:51.732 --> 01:54.976
I do.
But I gave her my word.

02:04.089 --> 02:06.712
SOS received.

02:06.712 --> 02:08.162
Oh, hero.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.853
Did you buy out
the whole store?

02:09.853 --> 02:14.513
Well, eggs are not cheap,
and they were on sale, so...

02:14.513 --> 02:18.241
Have you talked to Eli?

02:18.241 --> 02:21.037
No, uh, but he's working
for Robel now,

02:21.037 --> 02:23.039
and I promised to volunteer
on the campaign.

02:23.039 --> 02:25.421
So he's going to have to talk
to me eventually.

02:25.421 --> 02:27.388
Have you?
- No.

02:29.356 --> 02:30.529
- Do you want to talk to Eli?
- No, no, no.

02:30.529 --> 02:31.944
I was just curious.
- Okay.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.015
I mean, do you
want to talk to Eli,

02:34.015 --> 02:35.362
like, outside
of campaign stuff?

02:35.362 --> 02:36.984
Because if you did, that
would be totally fine.

02:36.984 --> 02:38.710
No, no, no.

02:38.710 --> 02:40.884
But you could, too,
if you wanted to or whatever.

02:40.884 --> 02:42.265
We're doing
the right thing, right?

02:42.265 --> 02:45.717
Like, prioritizing us?
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:45.717 --> 02:47.339
Hos over bros.

02:47.339 --> 02:49.548
Not that we're hos.
That's--that's what people say.

02:49.548 --> 02:51.205
That's not what people say.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.862
No, I think they
do, you know--

02:52.862 --> 02:54.381
Gibson!
How's your head?

02:54.381 --> 02:56.037
Doctor cleared me,
so I'm all good.

02:56.037 --> 02:58.626
Oh, I love your French toast.

02:58.626 --> 03:00.456
I bet you say that
to all the boys.

03:00.456 --> 03:03.873
I could eat
breakfast for every meal.

03:03.873 --> 03:06.703
I mean, pancakes, eggs--
it's, like, variety,

03:06.703 --> 03:08.705
options, choices.

03:08.705 --> 03:11.398
Yeah, when I was captain
at 54,

03:11.398 --> 03:14.228
Thursdays were always
pancake night--no exception.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.643
We should do that.

03:15.643 --> 03:17.473
Well, as acting captain,
you could implement

03:17.473 --> 03:19.958
a routine like that
while Beckett's gone.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.650
<i>- Engine 19...</i>
- Turn it off.

03:22.650 --> 03:24.411
<i>Ladder 19, Aid Car 19</i>

03:24.411 --> 03:26.758
<i>requested at 2618 Prescott Street.</i>

03:26.758 --> 03:29.450
You just had to say
Beckett, didn't you?

03:31.797 --> 03:33.247
Natasha Ross.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.491
What is this?

03:35.491 --> 03:38.597
Wow. I didn't think Bishop
would go soft on me.

03:38.597 --> 03:40.254
You had me followed
like some kind of pervert?

03:40.254 --> 03:41.911
This is a violation of privacy.

03:41.911 --> 03:43.568
Ooh, the horror.

03:43.568 --> 03:46.881
Come on, all's fair
in love and politics,

03:46.881 --> 03:48.607
and you made it political

03:48.607 --> 03:49.988
when you turned the city and FD
against me.

03:49.988 --> 03:51.679
What do you want?

03:51.679 --> 03:53.681
Honestly, humiliating
you would have been enough.

03:53.681 --> 03:56.857
But now that Montgomery is
out of the race for mayor...

03:56.857 --> 04:00.240
- You want my endorsement.
- And those photos get buried.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.794
And if I'd rather
endorse Osman?

04:02.794 --> 04:04.692
I don't think
the firefighters' union

04:04.692 --> 04:07.454
would approve of the chief
promoting the grunt

04:07.454 --> 04:09.801
she's sleeping with, do you?

04:09.801 --> 04:12.459
Once they see those pictures,
they'll turn against you.

04:12.459 --> 04:14.806
And no chief in the history
of the department

04:14.806 --> 04:18.913
has ever survived losing
the support of the union.

04:18.913 --> 04:22.469
If I back you and you win,

04:22.469 --> 04:24.436
how can I be sure
you won't fire me

04:24.436 --> 04:25.920
as soon as you take office?

04:25.920 --> 04:27.439
Only the mayor has that power.

04:31.167 --> 04:33.963
Well, you just have
to take my word for it.

04:33.963 --> 04:36.103
Tell you what--think about it.

04:36.103 --> 04:37.484
You got
until the end of the day,

04:37.484 --> 04:39.693
then I've got a date
with the union.

04:42.661 --> 04:45.630
You can hold on to those.
I've got copies.

04:55.018 --> 04:59.160
I heard you're looking to
move because of the doxxing.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.921
Temporarily, yeah.

05:00.921 --> 05:02.681
Man, I didn't know
it got that bad.

05:02.681 --> 05:03.993
Yeah, we never should
have pulled that stunt

05:03.993 --> 05:05.305
at the fake abortion clinic.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.996
No, no, they were--
they were tricking women

05:06.996 --> 05:08.238
and spreading lies.

05:11.414 --> 05:15.349
You know, my dad cried the
night before my first day

05:15.349 --> 05:17.040
at the academy.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.180
That first year, he would
call me after every shift.

05:19.180 --> 05:22.183
He would even show up randomly
and check my equipment...

05:22.183 --> 05:23.668
I mean, to the point

05:23.668 --> 05:25.704
where I had to yell at him
several times to stop

05:25.704 --> 05:27.223
until he finally did.

05:27.223 --> 05:28.707
Look, if you're working
your way up to telling me

05:28.707 --> 05:29.984
that I shouldn't worry
about Pru--

05:29.984 --> 05:31.192
Oh, no.
That's impossible.

05:31.192 --> 05:32.987
You're going to worry
about her

05:32.987 --> 05:34.851
and the boys and Dr. Bailey.

05:34.851 --> 05:37.992
What I'm saying is,
in the end...

05:37.992 --> 05:40.029
it was my dad, not me,

05:40.029 --> 05:41.789
that took a risk
that cost him his life.

05:41.789 --> 05:43.066
Yeah, to save you.

05:43.066 --> 05:46.346
Yeah, it doesn't make it
hurt any less.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.555
You can't avoid the crazies.

05:48.555 --> 05:50.350
And Bailey is--

05:50.350 --> 05:52.041
Bailey's gonna Bailey.

05:52.041 --> 05:55.734
But you--you can keep
yourself safe so--

05:55.734 --> 05:57.943
so you can be there for them.

06:06.227 --> 06:08.575
Okay, everyone,
SCBAs on.

06:08.575 --> 06:10.922
We've got a working fire
in a two-story residential.

06:10.922 --> 06:12.406
Hughes, you're medical.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.408
Herrera, Warren, Montgomery,
ventilate that roof.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.237
Larsson, Wiggins,
evacuate the structure.

06:16.237 --> 06:18.067
Sullivan, Gibson,
fire attack on A side.

06:18.067 --> 06:20.069
Let's move!

06:20.069 --> 06:23.969
Is everybody out?

06:23.969 --> 06:26.386
Here, here, here.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.422
Come on.
- There's more boys inside.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.493
Okay, come on.
Wait, how many? How many?

06:30.493 --> 06:32.944
I don't know.
I think ten or so.

06:32.944 --> 06:35.084
19 of us live here
if you count me.

06:35.084 --> 06:36.775
You got to get them out!
- What?

06:36.775 --> 06:38.950
Oh, crap. Okay.

06:38.950 --> 06:41.504
What are you waiting for?
Get in there and save my guys.

06:41.504 --> 06:43.264
I need to get you
away from the house.

06:43.264 --> 06:44.611
What's your name?
Hey, what's your name?

06:44.611 --> 06:46.060
June Hardy.
I'm the house manager.

06:46.060 --> 06:47.199
This is a sober-living house.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.098
All the boys here
are clean and sober.

06:49.098 --> 06:50.789
Me too, 30 years.
- Okay, well, I'm Vic.

06:50.789 --> 06:52.515
And, uh, we need to get you
over there to treat you, okay?

06:52.515 --> 06:53.758
- No, no.
- First--

06:53.758 --> 06:54.586
I'm fine!
How can I help?

06:54.586 --> 06:56.312
Okay.

06:56.312 --> 06:57.796
We're going to get you
over to Captain Ruiz,

06:57.796 --> 06:59.108
and you can tell him
exactly how many guys

06:59.108 --> 07:00.281
are unaccounted for, all right?

07:05.873 --> 07:08.773
Looks like a bad renovation.

07:15.987 --> 07:17.989
First floor
is fully involved.

07:17.989 --> 07:20.819
And the house is like a maze,
just rooms divided into rooms.

07:20.819 --> 07:22.372
<i>Copy.
Sending another line.</i>

07:29.138 --> 07:31.002
I've seen houses
like this before.

07:31.002 --> 07:33.694
This fire is going to run right
through these cheap walls.

07:48.571 --> 07:50.159
<i>You've reached
Robert Sullivan.</i>

07:50.159 --> 07:52.333
<i>Please leave a--</i>

07:59.237 --> 08:00.687
Dispatch, this is Chief Ross.

08:00.687 --> 08:02.827
Can you give me a 20
on Company 19?

08:02.827 --> 08:05.830
<i>Full Company 19
is at 2618 Prescott Street.</i>

08:05.830 --> 08:06.969
Copy.

08:15.771 --> 08:17.220
Hi.

08:17.220 --> 08:18.774
Okay, I have
the whole day planned.

08:18.774 --> 08:20.500
First, rage room, you know,
like we talked about,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.502
followed by a nice picnic
in Discovery Park.

08:22.502 --> 08:26.195
And for tonight, a reservation
at the Pink Door.

08:26.195 --> 08:27.507
What?
- N--

08:27.507 --> 08:28.887
It's your favorite.

08:28.887 --> 08:30.855
I love how excited you are

08:30.855 --> 08:33.513
and how much thought you've put
into our second first date.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.238
Uh, but?

08:35.238 --> 08:37.378
I-I thought it was going
to be a slow night,

08:37.378 --> 08:39.519
but babies wait for nobody,
and now I'm exhausted.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.244
Okay, you know,
I want this day

08:41.244 --> 08:42.452
to be whatever
you want it to be,

08:42.452 --> 08:44.247
so I can just drop
you off at your hotel,

08:44.247 --> 08:45.732
and you can get some sleep
if you want.

08:45.732 --> 08:47.388
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

08:47.388 --> 08:49.459
I just--you know, I want
to put my feet up

08:49.459 --> 08:51.220
and--and have a drink.

08:51.220 --> 08:53.878
What about Joe's bar?
- Joe's?

08:53.878 --> 08:55.051
Ah.

09:10.757 --> 09:12.482
Path is solid.

09:12.482 --> 09:14.381
All right,
we'll follow your lead.

09:20.663 --> 09:23.079
Gibson said this
place is a maze.

09:23.079 --> 09:25.323
We need to cut vent holes
on both sides of the ridge.

09:25.323 --> 09:26.393
Copy.

09:28.119 --> 09:30.500
Hey, the roof over here is--

09:30.500 --> 09:32.848
Ugh! Ugh!

09:32.848 --> 09:34.781
Warren!

09:45.792 --> 09:47.966
Warren!
Warren!

09:47.966 --> 09:51.694
Herrera,
what the hell just happened?

10:22.483 --> 10:26.142
Emergency traffic!

10:28.593 --> 10:31.320
Oh, come on.

10:31.320 --> 10:35.635
Herrera!

10:56.241 --> 10:58.450
Warren!

10:58.450 --> 11:00.211
There's still nothing.

11:00.211 --> 11:02.109
- Be careful, Herrera.
- I'm fine!

11:02.109 --> 11:03.524
We don't need
to lose you, too.

11:03.524 --> 11:07.218
No one has been lost, Montgomery.

11:07.218 --> 11:09.013
Larsson, Wiggins,
you're rapid intervention.

11:09.013 --> 11:10.290
Go find Warren.
- Hey.

11:10.290 --> 11:11.843
Hey, hey, listen,
I need to speak to you.

11:11.843 --> 11:13.673
Herrera, Montgomery, I need
you to get off the roof

11:13.673 --> 11:15.226
the minute you finish
ventilating--copy?

11:15.226 --> 11:17.055
- Sir, I--
- One second, ma'am.

11:17.055 --> 11:18.401
<i>Yes, but W-Warren--</i>

11:18.401 --> 11:20.680
Herrera, we're going
to get him out, okay?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.164
<i>Copy, Captain.</i>

11:22.164 --> 11:23.234
Hey!

11:23.234 --> 11:25.408
Hey, you're gonna listen to me,

11:25.408 --> 11:27.238
and you're gonna listen
to me right now!

11:27.238 --> 11:28.964
I'm sorry.
You said 19 people live here?

11:28.964 --> 11:30.620
All right, this is
a four-bedroom house.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.243
Well, that is not my fault.

11:32.243 --> 11:34.245
We had to divide each bedroom
into three smaller ones.

11:34.245 --> 11:36.212
Some of the boys double up,
but they share.

11:36.212 --> 11:38.732
- Well, that's not up to code.
- Like I said, I didn't do it.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.492
I just work here.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.392
I'm maid, cook, mother,
counselor, good cop, bad cop.

11:43.392 --> 11:44.876
All right, well,
your improvised rooms

11:44.876 --> 11:46.498
have created a firetrap.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.638
I am giving addicts
a roof over their head

11:48.638 --> 11:50.399
while they focus
on their recovery!

11:50.399 --> 11:52.228
It's tough enough
to stay clean,

11:52.228 --> 11:53.920
but to do it on the streets?

11:53.920 --> 11:55.093
And if we don't make
room for them here,

11:55.093 --> 11:56.750
that's where they'll be.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.648
Now, are you going to keep
giving me a hard time,

11:58.648 --> 12:00.927
or are you going
to go get my boys?

12:00.927 --> 12:03.101
All right, we're doing
everything we can, okay?

12:03.101 --> 12:05.552
Please tell me,
who's still missing?

12:05.552 --> 12:09.659
Taylor, uh, Milo,
and--and Chuy.

12:09.659 --> 12:10.764
Taylor, Milo, Chuy. Okay.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.284
Chuy? Chuy?

12:13.284 --> 12:14.837
And the third baby
had stalled labor,

12:14.837 --> 12:16.459
so I made the mom do squats.

12:16.459 --> 12:18.254
And I was about to
start her on Pitocin--

12:18.254 --> 12:19.842
A third baby?
Her poor vagina.

12:19.842 --> 12:21.085
I know.

12:21.085 --> 12:22.293
Thankfully, they're all okay.

12:22.293 --> 12:24.260
But when I start
my own practice,

12:24.260 --> 12:25.468
I'll do a more even split

12:25.468 --> 12:27.539
between pregnant
and non-pregnant patients--

12:27.539 --> 12:29.024
You want to open your
own practice one day?

12:29.024 --> 12:30.922
- Oh, absolutely.
- I did not know that.

12:30.922 --> 12:32.752
Yeah, that way,
I can make my own schedule

12:32.752 --> 12:34.615
and have more
flexibility for kids--

12:34.615 --> 12:36.790
um, our kids...

12:36.790 --> 12:38.758
one day, hopefully--

12:38.758 --> 12:40.449
maybe, b-but not right now.

12:40.449 --> 12:42.278
Uh, I--

12:42.278 --> 12:45.281
It's not like you
to take a day off.

12:45.281 --> 12:46.869
What's the catch?

12:46.869 --> 12:48.768
Are you benched again
and not telling me?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.321
No. I have a lot
of personal days,

12:50.321 --> 12:51.978
and after mine
and Andy's meeting

12:51.978 --> 12:53.496
with Chief Ross this morning,

12:53.496 --> 12:55.291
I'm actually grateful
that I'm not at work today,

12:55.291 --> 12:57.052
because, you know,
Chief Ross hates me,

12:57.052 --> 12:59.157
and she has every right to.

12:59.157 --> 13:00.331
But, you know, it's tough.

13:00.331 --> 13:02.816
Anyway, let's get a drink.
- Yeah.

13:02.816 --> 13:06.302
You know this is
the first place we met, right?

13:06.302 --> 13:07.959
Yes, but the first
time I saw you was

13:07.959 --> 13:10.824
when you brought in the nose.
- I was there.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.343
Very cool.

13:12.343 --> 13:13.723
It's nice to see
you two in here.

13:13.723 --> 13:15.864
What can I get you?

13:15.864 --> 13:18.142
Uh, I'll take a Bloody Mary,
and she'll have a white wine.

13:18.142 --> 13:20.144
A Bloody Mary?
I thought you hated tomatoes.

13:20.144 --> 13:22.663
It's a new thing, okay?
They're growing on me.

13:22.663 --> 13:24.665
- Oh, God, it's them.
- "Them"?

13:24.665 --> 13:26.357
How are they still going?

13:26.357 --> 13:27.841
Yeah, there was
a big bachelorette group

13:27.841 --> 13:29.429
in here last night,
bar hopping.

13:29.429 --> 13:31.155
12 tributes entered,
and it looks

13:31.155 --> 13:33.674
like only 3 still stand.

13:33.674 --> 13:34.986
Pray for me.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.094
Uh, hi.

13:39.094 --> 13:40.543
My girlfriends and I--

13:40.543 --> 13:42.822
See the one in the white
who's about to get married?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.031
We were wondering
if you'd come dance with us.

13:45.031 --> 13:46.549
That's okay.
Thank you, though.

13:46.549 --> 13:48.034
Look, she's
kind of bummed out

13:48.034 --> 13:49.449
because the other ladies left.

13:49.449 --> 13:51.313
She keeps saying
three people are not a party.

13:51.313 --> 13:52.624
We just need bodies.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.041
So can you pretty ladies
just come give us

13:55.041 --> 13:56.042
a half-baked shoulder shimmy?

13:56.042 --> 13:57.560
- Sorry, no, no.
- Yeah.

13:57.560 --> 13:58.941
- I think I should...
- While we're young.

13:58.941 --> 14:00.529
- Shoulder shimmy.
- While we're young.

14:00.529 --> 14:01.530
- Wha--
- Yeah.

14:05.189 --> 14:07.122
Yes, yes, yes!

14:07.122 --> 14:08.606
You're not getting out of this!

14:08.606 --> 14:09.952
- Oh, me?
- Yes!

14:09.952 --> 14:11.885
- I'm so tired.
- No, come on, please.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.715
It's my wedding.
- Okay, okay, okay.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.727
Hey!
I got him.

14:28.557 --> 14:32.492
Sir! Sir!

14:32.492 --> 14:35.150
We found one civilian
on the first floor,

14:35.150 --> 14:37.083
B-side hallway.
<i>- Copy.</i>

14:37.083 --> 14:38.636
Sending Klyne and Cutler
to you now.

14:38.636 --> 14:39.637
Copy.

14:43.399 --> 14:45.229
Sir!

14:45.229 --> 14:46.540
Sir!

14:50.096 --> 14:52.443
Hey, we're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

14:52.443 --> 14:54.824
- What's his status?
- He's barely got a pulse.

14:54.824 --> 14:56.619
Get him out, kay?

14:56.619 --> 14:58.483
The fire is about to burst
through that wall any second.

14:58.483 --> 15:00.244
Got it.

15:00.244 --> 15:02.418
Stay close to the hose line,
so you don't get lost in here.

15:07.803 --> 15:12.187
Oh, thank God! Help us!

15:12.187 --> 15:14.430
Come on, we got to go.
We got to go.

15:14.430 --> 15:16.018
- My knee, my knee, my knee!
- He can't walk on it.

15:16.018 --> 15:17.986
He can't walk on it.
- Ah! I just had surgery.

15:17.986 --> 15:19.815
We tried to find his
crutches, but it was too dark.

15:19.815 --> 15:22.576
And we tried
to find our way out,

15:22.576 --> 15:24.371
but the smoke is so thick.

15:24.371 --> 15:26.615
We just kept
getting turned around.

15:26.615 --> 15:28.548
Okay.

15:28.548 --> 15:30.446
First thing we need to do is
get you down on the ground.

15:33.139 --> 15:35.796
What if we--
what if we can't get out?

15:35.796 --> 15:37.660
Are we going to die in here?

15:37.660 --> 15:41.112
Milo, you still got to call
your mom, go to Montana.

15:41.112 --> 15:42.458
You got to make your amends.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.495
This is not it, you hear me?

15:44.495 --> 15:46.290
We have to keep moving,
all right?

15:46.290 --> 15:48.292
Now, can you move on your own?
- No, no, no, it's pretty bad.

15:48.292 --> 15:49.845
It's okay,

15:49.845 --> 15:51.985
because Milo and I are going
to get you out of here.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.607
Milo, come on.
Get under his arm.

15:58.164 --> 16:00.338
Let's go.

16:00.338 --> 16:04.791
- 14 and 37.
- Thank you so much, gentlemen.

16:04.791 --> 16:07.138
Chief Ross.

16:07.138 --> 16:09.520
It's nice to see you.
What--what brings you here?

16:09.520 --> 16:11.625
I apologize
for dropping in unannounced,

16:11.625 --> 16:13.248
but this is urgent.

16:13.248 --> 16:16.078
Michael Dixon is planning
to unleash a scandal

16:16.078 --> 16:18.080
to embarrass the department
and the union.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.324
Well, you did kind
of make an enemy of him

16:20.324 --> 16:21.739
at that press conference.

16:21.739 --> 16:24.707
What--what kind of scandal?

16:24.707 --> 16:27.089
He plans to accuse me
of being romantically involved

16:27.089 --> 16:28.677
with a firefighter
that I promoted.

16:32.819 --> 16:34.994
Is that true?

16:36.512 --> 16:38.100
Yes.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.550
I am in a relationship

16:39.550 --> 16:42.691
with Lieutenant Robert Sullivan
of Station 19.

16:46.695 --> 16:49.836
- Time for shots!
- Oh, I can't have another sip.

16:49.836 --> 16:51.355
Weak!

16:51.355 --> 16:55.014
We are literally going
on, like, hour 17.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.705
- You okay?
- Help.

16:56.705 --> 16:58.914
Okay, I think that maybe
we should call it.

16:58.914 --> 17:01.227
- No, another round!
- No, you're cut off.

17:01.227 --> 17:03.574
No, you are cut off.

17:03.574 --> 17:06.404
Ugh! Okay, well, what she
doesn't know is not gonna--

17:06.404 --> 17:07.854
No, no!
Not a good idea.

17:07.854 --> 17:08.889
- No.
- Let's get water.

17:08.889 --> 17:10.477
- Oh, water?
- Water.

17:10.477 --> 17:12.065
- Yeah.
- Yes, water.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.067
- Water, water.
- You're being a B-word.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.482
- Picture it.
- Yeah?

17:15.482 --> 17:18.140
I'm sitting at home,
taking care of two kids

17:18.140 --> 17:19.935
while my husband
is in Las Vegas

17:19.935 --> 17:21.764
doing God knows what
with God knows who.

17:21.764 --> 17:23.559
I'm just saying, the slot
machines wasn't the only place

17:23.559 --> 17:25.872
he was getting lucky.

17:25.872 --> 17:27.494
Fry?
- No, thank you.

17:27.494 --> 17:28.806
Uh, I think we should go.

17:28.806 --> 17:30.256
Yeah, I thought
you'd never ask.

17:30.256 --> 17:32.430
Uh, it was so nice
meeting everyone.

17:32.430 --> 17:34.432
Um, we're going to head out.
- Bye.

17:34.432 --> 17:35.916
Wait, wait, wait!

17:35.916 --> 17:37.435
We haven't even shown you
the dance we're going to do.

17:37.435 --> 17:38.919
Come on, ladies.
- Lucy, maybe we shouldn't.

17:38.919 --> 17:41.163
It's embarrassing enough
we have to do it

17:41.163 --> 17:43.407
in front of 200 of your closest
family and friends.

17:43.407 --> 17:44.787
- Shut up!
- Congratulations again, Lucy.

17:44.787 --> 17:47.618
- What are you doing?
- Chill, blondie.

17:47.618 --> 17:48.929
- Oh, my God!
- No, no!

17:48.929 --> 17:52.278
Lucy!

17:54.280 --> 17:56.144
Bitch, that's
gonna leave a mark.

18:00.976 --> 18:03.599
Lieutenant Sullivan and I had
a romantic relationship

18:03.599 --> 18:05.256
when we served in Iraq.

18:05.256 --> 18:07.465
We reconnected
when I took this job,

18:07.465 --> 18:11.366
but we did not date
until after I promoted him.

18:11.366 --> 18:14.369
And how did Michael Dixon
find out about this?

18:14.369 --> 18:16.543
He had us followed...

18:18.304 --> 18:20.616
And photographed.

18:29.211 --> 18:31.558
You're aware
of the policy prohibiting

18:31.558 --> 18:33.974
fraternizing between department
brass and rank-and-file?

18:33.974 --> 18:35.804
- I am.
- You are?

18:35.804 --> 18:38.669
So, what, are you denying
that you violated--

18:38.669 --> 18:40.705
- Are we really doing this?
- What do you mean by "this"?

18:40.705 --> 18:42.190
Because this

18:42.190 --> 18:44.019
looks like you got your hand
caught in the cookie jar,

18:44.019 --> 18:45.641
and now you want us
to look the other way.

18:45.641 --> 18:47.747
You know, in the short time
that I have been here,

18:47.747 --> 18:49.714
I have seen this union
look the other way

18:49.714 --> 18:51.509
when sloppy firefighters

18:51.509 --> 18:53.304
who should have retired
15 years ago

18:53.304 --> 18:55.030
made fatal mistakes on the job.

18:55.030 --> 18:57.515
I've seen it allow
a serial sexual harasser

18:57.515 --> 19:00.346
retire with full pension
instead of face discipline.

19:00.346 --> 19:02.037
And this is where you
want to draw the line?

19:02.037 --> 19:04.108
I can understand
why you'd be anti-union--

19:04.108 --> 19:06.041
- Okay, both of you--
- No, I am pro-union!

19:06.041 --> 19:09.493
I am anti a system that has
a million things wrong with it.

19:09.493 --> 19:11.840
I put my life on the line

19:11.840 --> 19:14.325
serving my country
for a decade in Iraq.

19:14.325 --> 19:16.534
I fought
to drag this department

19:16.534 --> 19:18.881
kicking and screaming
into the 21st century,

19:18.881 --> 19:22.022
to make your jobs
safer and better.

19:22.022 --> 19:23.334
And you want to do
Dixon's bidding

19:23.334 --> 19:25.543
by calling me out
on who I'm sleeping with?

19:25.543 --> 19:28.201
No, no, no, no.
This union owes Dixon nothing.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.721
You have my back, not his.

19:30.721 --> 19:34.034
Firefighter
down at 2618 Prescott Street.

19:34.034 --> 19:36.036
<i>Radio contact lost.</i>

19:38.625 --> 19:40.834
Copy.
I'm on my way.

19:43.492 --> 19:44.700
Excuse me.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.530
Duty calls.

20:01.338 --> 20:04.927
Crap.

20:04.927 --> 20:07.309
Captain, roof ventilation
has helped a little,

20:07.309 --> 20:08.897
but the fire
has spread upstairs,

20:08.897 --> 20:10.312
<i>and the smoke is increasing</i>

20:10.312 --> 20:11.658
<i>faster than
it can ventilate out.</i>

20:11.658 --> 20:13.764
And the fires keep
reigniting behind us.

20:13.764 --> 20:15.559
Well, keep moving forward.
Another team is behind you.

20:15.559 --> 20:17.077
Copy.

20:17.077 --> 20:18.838
RIC team,
any word on Warren?

20:18.838 --> 20:20.080
<i>Negative.
No luck, Captain.</i>

20:20.080 --> 20:21.772
This place is a labyrinth.

20:21.772 --> 20:24.257
How long do you think we got
till the place completely goes?

20:24.257 --> 20:25.914
Not very long!

20:25.914 --> 20:28.572
- Thanks, Helm.
- Yep.

20:28.572 --> 20:30.608
Got to put my med-school debt
to use somehow.

20:30.608 --> 20:33.059
Oh, my God.
It's bad, isn't it?

20:33.059 --> 20:34.336
I'm sure it's fine.

20:34.336 --> 20:36.165
It's just a little bit
of blood.

20:36.165 --> 20:38.098
A little blood?

20:38.098 --> 20:40.929
I look like one of the Starks
at the Red Wedding!

20:40.929 --> 20:42.344
No, stop.

20:42.344 --> 20:45.347
I'm supposed to get married
in six days.

20:45.347 --> 20:46.797
Six!

20:46.797 --> 20:48.971
I cannot have a bruised eye

20:48.971 --> 20:52.147
and a broken nose
on my wedding day!

20:52.147 --> 20:55.012
Maybe you'll bleed to death,
and you can miss it altogether.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.360
I was trying to
find a solution.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.086
Honestly,
that might be better

21:00.086 --> 21:01.639
than walking down the aisle

21:01.639 --> 21:03.123
looking like I just got
out of the ring

21:03.123 --> 21:05.436
with Mike freakin' Tyson!

21:05.436 --> 21:06.955
- Okay, Lucy, I'm a doctor.
- Stop!

21:06.955 --> 21:09.475
You got to let
me examine you, okay?

21:09.475 --> 21:11.856
One second.

21:15.619 --> 21:17.621
Hey.

21:17.621 --> 21:20.969
When you walk down the aisle,
your husband is gonna see you,

21:20.969 --> 21:23.627
not your makeup,
not your dress,

21:23.627 --> 21:25.974
not your bruises.

21:25.974 --> 21:28.114
If he's the man you're supposed
to be with,

21:28.114 --> 21:29.874
he'll see you for you.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.640
- It's all just a little scary.
- I know.

21:38.918 --> 21:42.335
I remember the first time
I saw my wife at our wedding.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.579
For a few seconds,
everything stopped.

21:44.579 --> 21:45.925
Nothing else existed.

21:45.925 --> 21:49.860
It was just me and her
against the world.

21:49.860 --> 21:53.001
Look, the future is scary.

21:53.001 --> 21:55.141
But that is part
of the fun of it.

21:55.141 --> 21:57.039
No one knows what comes next,

21:57.039 --> 21:59.490
but that's what is so special
about marriage--

21:59.490 --> 22:01.941
finding that person that
you want to share it with--

22:01.941 --> 22:04.599
the ups, the downs, all of it.

22:04.599 --> 22:06.186
Here you go.

22:06.186 --> 22:08.672
Okay, if you could call
one person

22:08.672 --> 22:11.882
in the whole world right now,
who would that be?

22:11.882 --> 22:14.022
My mom's plastic surgeon.

22:14.022 --> 22:15.506
Okay.

22:15.506 --> 22:17.197
After that?

22:17.197 --> 22:19.441
My fiancé.

22:21.029 --> 22:22.030
That's how you know.

22:24.032 --> 22:25.205
Wait.

22:25.205 --> 22:28.277
You two are married
to each other?

22:28.277 --> 22:30.245
Oh, shut up!

22:30.245 --> 22:34.249
Okay, A, you are, like,
the hottest couple ever.

22:34.249 --> 22:38.046
And, B, now, like, I'm really
upset that I'm marrying a guy.

22:45.225 --> 22:46.744
Come on.

22:46.744 --> 22:47.918
We're almost there.

22:47.918 --> 22:50.230
Milo! Milo!

22:50.230 --> 22:51.818
Milo, I need you
to keep moving, okay?

22:51.818 --> 22:53.579
Even if you have to crawl.
Come on!

22:53.579 --> 22:55.891
I can't, I'm sorry.
- He has super-bad asthma.

22:55.891 --> 22:59.412
His lungs can't take the smoke.

22:59.412 --> 23:02.104
Okay. Lean up here.
Lean up against the wall.

23:02.104 --> 23:04.728
Okay, hold on.
Okay, Milo, come on.

23:04.728 --> 23:06.592
Come on,
put your arm around me.

23:06.592 --> 23:10.078
Don't let up.

23:10.078 --> 23:11.735
Okay.

23:22.780 --> 23:23.850
This is my fault.

23:23.850 --> 23:25.507
No, June,
it's not your fault.

23:25.507 --> 23:27.785
It is. One of the boys got
six months clean,

23:27.785 --> 23:29.442
and I wanted to fry up
some fish for him.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.789
But somehow I knocked
the fryer over,

23:31.789 --> 23:35.275
and the grease caught on fire,
and it spread so fast.

23:35.275 --> 23:37.277
I started yelling
for everyone to get out.

23:37.277 --> 23:39.245
Kenneth pushed me away
and went back

23:39.245 --> 23:41.799
to try to put
the fire out, but--

23:41.799 --> 23:43.318
Okay, June,
it was an accident.

23:43.318 --> 23:46.632
These men--their whole damn
lives were on fire,

23:46.632 --> 23:50.049
and they fought like
hell to turn it all around.

23:50.049 --> 23:52.120
Your captain called
this place a firetrap,

23:52.120 --> 23:53.639
but to them, it's home.

23:53.639 --> 23:55.157
They need it.

23:55.157 --> 23:57.470
There's a lot more folks
out there that need it, too.

23:57.470 --> 24:00.300
I could run four houses
just like this one,

24:00.300 --> 24:01.957
and it still
wouldn't be enough.

24:04.615 --> 24:07.722
You know,
for what it's worth...

24:07.722 --> 24:09.724
I think you're pretty badass.

24:09.724 --> 24:13.141
Thank you.

24:13.141 --> 24:14.556
Okay.

24:14.556 --> 24:16.903
Oh, Chuy!

24:16.903 --> 24:21.390
Did you see Taylor or Milo?

24:21.390 --> 24:22.978
Hey, Captain,
we need more aid cars.

24:22.978 --> 24:24.393
Five minutes out.

24:24.393 --> 24:26.982
Has, um--has Warren--

24:26.982 --> 24:28.812
Negative.

24:33.264 --> 24:35.853
What if Warren got hurt
in the fall?

24:35.853 --> 24:38.580
I'm the lieutenant. I sh--
should have taken the lead.

24:38.580 --> 24:40.340
It wouldn't be any better
if it were you in there.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.204
Warren knows what he's doing.

24:42.204 --> 24:44.137
<i>Herrera, I need you
at incident command.</i>

24:44.137 --> 24:46.346
Copy.
I'm on my way.

24:46.346 --> 24:48.210
Ask for Dr. Owen Hunt.

24:48.210 --> 24:50.212
He'll tell you where
you need to go.

24:50.212 --> 24:54.182
Thank you
for, um, everything.

24:57.806 --> 25:00.878
Wow.

25:00.878 --> 25:03.018
You two are goals.

25:03.018 --> 25:05.020
And I look up to you.

25:05.020 --> 25:07.022
Just know that.

25:08.886 --> 25:10.888
First your
pregnant patient is

25:10.888 --> 25:12.959
stuck in a vending machine,

25:12.959 --> 25:15.375
then bridezilla
and her maidens.

25:15.375 --> 25:17.723
Why can't we get
through a first date?

25:17.723 --> 25:21.243
I-I mean, who says
it has to be over?

25:21.243 --> 25:23.073
I have clothes
at the apartment,

25:23.073 --> 25:28.043
and I could use
a nice, hot shower.

25:28.043 --> 25:30.908
Oh, yes, the apartment.
Of course.

25:30.908 --> 25:32.047
Yeah, let's go.
- Mm-hmm, yeah?

25:32.047 --> 25:33.048
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

25:33.048 --> 25:34.187
- Yeah.
- Apartment?

25:42.644 --> 25:44.439
Taylor, come here.

25:44.439 --> 25:46.199
What are--what are--
what are you doing?

25:46.199 --> 25:47.753
Come here.

25:50.100 --> 25:53.206
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

25:53.206 --> 25:55.243
All right.

25:55.243 --> 25:57.901
I'm going to put this on you.

25:57.901 --> 26:00.248
Because I can't--

26:01.939 --> 26:04.355
I can't carry--

26:04.355 --> 26:07.082
I can't carry both of you,
not at the same time,

26:07.082 --> 26:10.776
and especially not
down the stairs.

26:10.776 --> 26:14.331
So put this on
and listen to me.

26:14.331 --> 26:15.746
I'm going to take Milo first.

26:15.746 --> 26:18.024
No.
Take Taylor first.

26:18.024 --> 26:19.750
He's like a dad to me.
- I'm gonna come back for him.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.269
Milo, I'm going to be okay.

26:21.269 --> 26:23.271
He's going to come
back for me, okay?

26:23.271 --> 26:24.583
Yeah, absolutely.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.171
Listen to me.
I'll be right back.

26:27.171 --> 26:29.588
I promise, okay?

26:29.588 --> 26:33.695
Come here, Milo.

26:33.695 --> 26:36.802
Come here.

26:36.802 --> 26:39.805
Here we go.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.535
- 19.
- Chief.

26:46.535 --> 26:48.503
What's the status on Warren?

26:48.503 --> 26:50.332
No radio communication since
he fell through the roof.

26:50.332 --> 26:51.540
RIC team is
dispatched and looking.

26:51.540 --> 26:52.990
What's taking so long?

26:52.990 --> 26:54.509
There's plywood dividers
in all the bedrooms.

26:54.509 --> 26:56.304
We're having trouble
making our way through.

26:56.304 --> 26:58.893
<i>Captain, we're making
no headway on the first floor.</i>

26:58.893 --> 27:01.896
<i>We have heavy fire and smoke
from both ends of the hallway.</i>

27:01.896 --> 27:03.414
Captain,
all critical patients

27:03.414 --> 27:05.002
have been transported
to Grey Sloan.

27:05.002 --> 27:06.625
- All civilians evac'd?
- All accounted for except two.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.179
Taylor and Milo--
they have names.

27:09.179 --> 27:10.732
- Taylor and Milo, of course.
- And Warren, too.

27:10.732 --> 27:12.561
Warren.

27:15.841 --> 27:18.637
Roof's caving in.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.535
Oh, my God.

27:20.535 --> 27:22.848
Has anyone inside
got eyes on Warren?

27:24.573 --> 27:25.989
Oh, my God.

27:25.989 --> 27:28.370
Fire attack,
what's your status?

27:28.370 --> 27:30.649
<i>Captain, the second floor
is starting to come down.</i>

27:30.649 --> 27:32.858
<i>Don't know how much longer
it'll hold.</i>

27:36.413 --> 27:37.828
Make your way out.

27:37.828 --> 27:39.865
I'm calling
an operational retreat.

27:39.865 --> 27:41.383
Repeat--retreat to safety.
- No.

27:41.383 --> 27:43.351
Captain, Warren
is still in there!

27:43.351 --> 27:46.181
If we retreat, it's over.

31:18.393 --> 31:19.291
I know.

31:21.914 --> 31:24.883
Come on, Warren,
let's get you checked out.

31:32.718 --> 31:34.478
There's nothing
you could have done.

31:54.429 --> 31:56.190
Hey.

31:56.190 --> 31:58.675
Good work, Captain.
You saved a lot of lives today.

31:58.675 --> 32:00.953
Not all of them.

32:00.953 --> 32:03.369
Yeah, losing a life, that's
always going to be a gut punch,

32:03.369 --> 32:05.026
but we would have
lost more if it had not been

32:05.026 --> 32:06.476
for your leadership.

32:06.476 --> 32:09.755
The way the fire tore
through that place, man--

32:09.755 --> 32:12.654
All right, talk to me.

32:12.654 --> 32:15.036
What's going on?
It's Warren.

32:15.036 --> 32:16.865
You know, I--

32:16.865 --> 32:18.488
I was going to call
the retreat.

32:18.488 --> 32:20.731
You know,
if he hadn't come out,

32:20.731 --> 32:23.148
I was going to call it.
- Yeah, but you didn't.

32:23.148 --> 32:26.151
And your instinct to call it
when you did

32:26.151 --> 32:27.462
was the right one.

32:27.462 --> 32:29.982
Ruiz, your team is safe.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.121
It's a win.

32:33.330 --> 32:35.470
Good work, 19.
- Chief.

32:38.887 --> 32:40.510
So are you actually good,

32:40.510 --> 32:42.477
or were you just going
along with it

32:42.477 --> 32:43.892
'cause she's the chief?

32:43.892 --> 32:46.343
Look, I don't envy you,

32:46.343 --> 32:48.414
because when I was inside
fighting that fire,

32:48.414 --> 32:50.416
I-I haven't felt that good
in months.

32:50.416 --> 32:54.144
And not having to be a captain
or a lieutenant, I can just go.

32:54.144 --> 32:56.181
I can just fight fires,
save lives,

32:56.181 --> 32:58.183
do what I love
with the team I love.

32:58.183 --> 33:01.496
And you--
Hey.

33:01.496 --> 33:02.981
You kept us safe.

33:04.430 --> 33:07.330
Take it from someone
who's not a chief,

33:07.330 --> 33:09.021
you were a good captain today.

33:11.506 --> 33:14.820
Thanks.

33:24.036 --> 33:26.832
Apparently
Warren had a tough call.

33:26.832 --> 33:31.009
Hey, are you okay?

33:31.009 --> 33:33.839
Okay, was today too much?
Should we have waited?

33:33.839 --> 33:36.842
It's not about the sex.
It's I...

33:36.842 --> 33:39.224
I can't move back in here.

33:39.224 --> 33:42.537
- I didn't-- I didn't ask.
- But I know you want me to.

33:42.537 --> 33:45.230
And I wish I could,
because today was magical,

33:45.230 --> 33:46.783
and I want to keep
that magic alive.

33:46.783 --> 33:48.129
But being back in here--

33:48.129 --> 33:52.064
It's just so painful,

33:52.064 --> 33:55.240
because for months,
I was in this bed alone.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.069
You shut me out.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.209
Y-you were here,
but you were not.

33:59.209 --> 34:02.419
I-I wasn't the person
you run to.

34:02.419 --> 34:04.939
I was the person you run from.
- Carina--

34:04.939 --> 34:07.735
I thought--I thought
I was ready to be back here,

34:07.735 --> 34:09.392
but I'm--I'm not.

34:09.392 --> 34:11.394
I can't.

34:11.394 --> 34:13.637
I can't.

34:13.637 --> 34:15.225
I can't.

34:18.504 --> 34:21.059
I'm sorry for everything
I put you through.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.511
It wasn't fair.

34:25.511 --> 34:27.410
I'm sorry
that I didn't listen to you

34:27.410 --> 34:28.894
when you tried to help me.

34:36.108 --> 34:38.904
I know that the version...

34:38.904 --> 34:42.356
Of us that is happy...

34:42.356 --> 34:46.912
and light and lovely...

34:46.912 --> 34:51.365
died in that hospital that day.

34:53.815 --> 34:57.647
But I'm willing to put
in the work to rebuild us...

34:57.647 --> 35:00.615
to make us stronger
and better...

35:04.999 --> 35:07.691
Because I know from the first
time I saw you in that bar...

35:10.487 --> 35:13.111
You were the person
that I wanted to call.

35:25.985 --> 35:27.746
Hey.
You all right?

35:27.746 --> 35:29.334
I just got a call from
a union rep asking me

35:29.334 --> 35:31.025
if you coerced me
into a relationship

35:31.025 --> 35:34.477
or promised to promote me
if I had sex with you?

35:34.477 --> 35:35.823
What--
- Oh, no.

35:35.823 --> 35:37.687
Is this what your mayday text
was about?

35:37.687 --> 35:39.827
They know.
Okay. somebody talked.

35:39.827 --> 35:41.242
Maybe it was Bishop.

35:41.242 --> 35:43.244
Maybe--or she told somebody
- Listen, no--

35:43.244 --> 35:44.970
Or Beckett--
- Listen, Sully. Listen.

35:44.970 --> 35:46.972
No, no, it was me.

35:46.972 --> 35:48.663
I told the union about us.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.364
I did try to talk to you
first, but you were on a call.

35:59.364 --> 36:01.020
And Dixon--he gave me no time.

36:01.020 --> 36:02.712
You had until
the end of the day!

36:02.712 --> 36:04.369
I was trying to get
ahead of it, Sully!

36:04.369 --> 36:05.991
I thought you would
understand that!

36:05.991 --> 36:08.027
Because of what
could happen to you.

36:08.027 --> 36:09.374
- No!
- Right? To hell with me.

36:09.374 --> 36:11.376
Don't--Okay, be angry,
but do not accuse me

36:11.376 --> 36:13.032
of not having
your best interests in mind.

36:13.032 --> 36:14.517
I'm now the guy
who slept with the chief

36:14.517 --> 36:16.001
to make lieutenant.
- Absolutely not.

36:16.001 --> 36:17.382
How is that
in my best interest?

36:17.382 --> 36:18.797
No, you're the victim.
I am the aggressor...

36:18.797 --> 36:20.626
- Tell me that.
- And a woman and a minority.

36:20.626 --> 36:22.387
That is three strikes.
- Oh, wow.

36:22.387 --> 36:23.905
The fact that this
relationship is consensual

36:23.905 --> 36:25.217
will not matter,
because I am toxic now.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.046
I will never be a chief again.

36:27.046 --> 36:29.083
See, I'm saying
this is about us,

36:29.083 --> 36:30.774
and you keep saying
it's more about you.

36:30.774 --> 36:32.224
Absolutely not.

36:32.224 --> 36:33.777
You keep thinking
about you first!

36:33.777 --> 36:35.054
It--it--

36:35.054 --> 36:38.057
Sully--

36:48.551 --> 36:50.069
Hey, boo.

36:50.069 --> 36:51.933
Oh, God, no.

36:51.933 --> 36:54.591
What's the matter--boyfriend
keeping you up at night?

36:54.591 --> 36:57.629
Yeah, my boyfriend, my work,
my classes, my goodness.

36:59.009 --> 37:00.390
I'm tired.

37:00.390 --> 37:02.185
I think maybe
I should take, like,

37:02.185 --> 37:06.154
a shift off every other week
until after finals.

37:06.154 --> 37:09.261
Yeah, okay, uh...

37:09.261 --> 37:11.125
let me check the calendar,

37:11.125 --> 37:13.679
but I could really use you here
for your shifts.

37:13.679 --> 37:15.750
No, no, I was talking to
boyfriend you, not captain you.

37:15.750 --> 37:17.614
Well, technically, you
were talking about work,

37:17.614 --> 37:18.960
so that is captain me.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.066
And the further in advance
I know that one

37:21.066 --> 37:22.343
of my firefighters needs--

37:22.343 --> 37:23.896
Since when can
I not talk to you

37:23.896 --> 37:25.933
about non-work stuff at work?

37:25.933 --> 37:27.728
Why are you trying to
pick a fight with me?

37:27.728 --> 37:29.419
No, I'm not--

37:29.419 --> 37:32.111
Uh, do you hear yourself?
I'm trying to talk to you.

37:32.111 --> 37:33.906
Yeah, and I was
just trying to help.

37:33.906 --> 37:35.598
Okay, I don't need--

37:35.598 --> 37:37.634
Actually, I'm not looking for
you to fix anything right now.

37:37.634 --> 37:40.361
I just wanted you to listen.
Okay, fine.

37:40.361 --> 37:44.262
You want me to just stand
here while you talk?

37:44.262 --> 37:47.610
Then I'll just stand here
while you talk.

37:47.610 --> 37:49.439
- Theo--
- What?

37:53.409 --> 37:55.859
You know what?
Never mind.

37:55.859 --> 37:57.309
- Vic.
- No, it's okay.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.966
Come on.

38:02.383 --> 38:03.833
<i>Hey, Andy.</i>

38:03.833 --> 38:06.456
Uh, if you want to talk
about today,

38:06.456 --> 38:08.734
I know it probably
brought up a lot for you

38:08.734 --> 38:13.325
seeing Warren like that,
and, uh, I'm here.

38:13.325 --> 38:16.777
- Thanks.
- Okay.

38:16.777 --> 38:18.986
Okay.

38:18.986 --> 38:21.782
Trav, life is short...

38:21.782 --> 38:24.681
and scary.

38:24.681 --> 38:28.961
And people fall through roofs,
and people die fighting fires.

38:28.961 --> 38:31.585
We see it every day.

38:31.585 --> 38:35.485
So, when you like the boy,
you tell him.

38:35.485 --> 38:37.867
- And you like Eli?
- No, but I can tell you do.

38:37.867 --> 38:39.972
- No. Oh, I don't--I don't.
- Yes.

38:39.972 --> 38:42.009
It's okay.
I-I know you.

38:42.009 --> 38:44.701
Look, Eli isn't the guy for me.

38:44.701 --> 38:47.186
I mean, even--even way before
you came into the picture...

38:47.186 --> 38:48.843
Let's just stop.

38:48.843 --> 38:51.501
I was trying to push myself
outside of my comfort zone

38:51.501 --> 38:53.779
and, you know, be
with someone different.

38:53.779 --> 38:58.197
But, look,
Eli and I would never work.

38:58.197 --> 39:01.062
But I think you two could.

39:01.062 --> 39:04.342
It doesn't really matter,
because he won't talk to me

39:04.342 --> 39:05.791
now that I dropped
out of the campaign.

39:05.791 --> 39:07.345
But...

39:07.345 --> 39:09.450
I do appreciate
you saying that.

39:09.450 --> 39:12.039
Like I said, life is short.

39:12.039 --> 39:14.282
So just...

39:14.282 --> 39:16.215
call the damn boy.

39:24.051 --> 39:26.571
Alexa, turn on the lights.

39:26.571 --> 39:28.400
<i>Okay.</i>

39:28.400 --> 39:32.473
Alexa, add body wash and
deodorant to my shopping list.

39:32.473 --> 39:35.062
<i>I have added body wash
and deodorant</i>

39:35.062 --> 39:36.926
<i>to your shopping list.</i>

39:36.926 --> 39:39.894
It's about time. I was going
to talk to you about that funk.

39:39.894 --> 39:41.586
You weren't
supposed to hear that.

39:44.485 --> 39:46.763
Is the arm broken?
- Yeah.

39:46.763 --> 39:49.076
Fractured, along with two ribs.

39:49.076 --> 39:51.078
Gonna be off duty for a while.

39:51.078 --> 39:53.321
Just came to clean up.
- Sure.

39:53.321 --> 39:56.324
Yeah, um, Gibson already
called you a sub.

39:56.324 --> 39:58.603
Um, thanks.

39:58.603 --> 39:59.397
Yeah.

40:03.884 --> 40:06.438
Uh, before you go,

40:06.438 --> 40:08.785
Herrera bought
a million eggs this morning.

40:08.785 --> 40:11.685
So we're having breakfast
for dinner.

40:14.446 --> 40:16.966
Some things only
pancakes can fix.

40:16.966 --> 40:19.106
Yeah, I know that's right.

40:23.455 --> 40:26.700
<i>♪ Say it all,
say it all to me ♪</i>

40:29.530 --> 40:31.808
Good news--I was actually
able to dress myself,

40:31.808 --> 40:35.709
with a lot of time and effort.

40:35.709 --> 40:38.332
It took me a minute.
- How you feeling, Ben?

40:38.332 --> 40:40.610
Uh, get in that bacon.
That'll help you out.

40:40.610 --> 40:42.301
- That'll fix you right up.
- Yeah.

40:42.301 --> 40:43.544
Bacon makes
everything better, right?

40:45.546 --> 40:48.791
<i>♪ You were there
when I needed it ♪</i>

40:51.310 --> 40:54.486
<i>♪ I found refuge
in your room ♪</i>

40:54.486 --> 40:55.901
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:55.901 --> 40:58.317
Andy texted,
said it was a tough call.

40:58.317 --> 41:00.285
Ooh, looks good.

41:00.285 --> 41:01.907
Breakfast for dinner?

41:01.907 --> 41:03.633
Feels a little 2012.

41:03.633 --> 41:05.739
Think you can mix
things up a bit, Ruiz?

41:05.739 --> 41:07.292
Kate?

41:07.292 --> 41:09.018
Oh, my God, what
are you doing here?

41:09.018 --> 41:10.468
Heard you needed a sub.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.021
both: Oh!

41:12.021 --> 41:13.747
I usually prefer
to be the dom,

41:13.747 --> 41:16.335
but we've all got to make
sacrifices, am I right, Trav?

41:16.335 --> 41:19.200
Oh, my God, Chaos Kate!

41:19.200 --> 41:22.341
Hey, now,
that was the old me.

41:22.341 --> 41:24.343
Yeah, right.

41:24.343 --> 41:26.311
Everyone, this is Kate Powell.

41:26.311 --> 41:28.175
She worked
with Mikey and me at 54.

41:28.175 --> 41:30.108
both: The best!
- Oh, stop it.

41:30.108 --> 41:32.317
- We're back together!
- Back together!

41:32.317 --> 41:34.388
The tripod!

41:34.388 --> 41:36.701
- Do you remember that time--
- So many memories.

41:36.701 --> 41:38.875
No, no, no, I, like,
almost can't even look

41:38.875 --> 41:40.359
at you without laughing.

42:17.569 --> 42:19.053
<i>Fantastic.</i>
