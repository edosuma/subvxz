00:45.201 --> 00:48.668
(shouts of encouragement)

00:48.971 --> 00:53.666
(grandiose music)

01:00.246 --> 01:03.625
- Gentlemen. Lovely day for it.
- Doctor.

01:03.651 --> 01:06.121
Hello Dr. Ogden. I didn't
know you were a football fan.

01:06.155 --> 01:08.244
I couldn't miss the match that decides

01:08.265 --> 01:10.825
which Canadian team will
go to the Olympic games.

01:10.860 --> 01:12.477
What I would give to go to St-Louis.

01:12.511 --> 01:14.172
The World's Fair and the Olympics.

01:14.292 --> 01:16.834
We have everything we need
right here in Toronto, son.

01:17.848 --> 01:19.392
(little groans)

01:20.884 --> 01:22.137
(referee's whistle)

01:22.389 --> 01:24.572
(whistle and sigh)

01:26.160 --> 01:27.976
(hubbub and whistle)

01:28.010 --> 01:30.803
- Now, watch the post!
- Cover the p... the post!

01:34.229 --> 01:35.540
(cheering)

01:35.859 --> 01:36.789
Damn it!

01:37.391 --> 01:39.546
These bloody free kicks
are the devil, I tell you.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.069
Not to worry, Nobby. They've
only been playing five minutes.

01:42.825 --> 01:44.690
Are you not cheering for Toronto?

01:45.145 --> 01:46.562
We're for Galt of course,

01:46.734 --> 01:48.355
since old Nobby and I go way back.

01:48.390 --> 01:49.612
Ever since I came to Canada

01:49.638 --> 01:52.307
- and started playing football...
- Teaching the colonials the English game.

01:52.316 --> 01:53.975
You tackled Nobby, then took
your fight off the field,

01:53.976 --> 01:55.290
and were mates ever since.

01:55.410 --> 01:57.574
It's nice to know that
you listen sometimes.

01:57.610 --> 02:00.230
Your father hasn't changed
a bit, still as opinionated

02:00.266 --> 02:01.420
and stubborn as ever.

02:01.421 --> 02:02.718
(with a chuckle): I'll say.

02:06.524 --> 02:08.789
Ugh! On him! On him!

02:09.217 --> 02:11.029
That Semple lad is quite the footballer.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.840
Reminds me of a young Tommy Crawshaw.

02:13.065 --> 02:14.637
He seems a bit selfish to me.

02:14.757 --> 02:15.841
Nonsense!

02:15.862 --> 02:18.085
You always have your best
player leading the attack.

02:18.156 --> 02:19.953
It makes more sense to
me to pass the ball around

02:19.979 --> 02:22.028
and use the whole
team. Like the Scots do.

02:22.063 --> 02:24.197
You've got a young
tactician on your hands, Tom.

02:24.723 --> 02:27.397
The English invented
football, not the bloody Scots!

02:27.436 --> 02:30.634
- Kick and run, that's football!
- Harcourt! Pay attention!

02:32.431 --> 02:36.176
(loud cry and whistle blowing)

02:37.189 --> 02:39.836
Lord Love-a-duck!
Gourlay, what was that?

02:40.487 --> 02:42.598
These Galway lads have got
to learn to tackle, Nobby.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.586
They won't be able to compete
at the Olympic games like this.

02:44.620 --> 02:46.975
But help him up. Be a
gentleman about it, at least.

02:47.002 --> 02:48.255
Enough play-acting.

02:48.498 --> 02:49.618
Take my hand.

02:50.738 --> 02:51.840
Get up man.

02:52.208 --> 02:53.823
He should be coming around by now.

02:55.124 --> 02:56.006
Robert.

02:57.958 --> 02:58.923
Robert!

02:59.640 --> 03:00.946
Inspector.

03:03.544 --> 03:04.540
Move aside lads.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.125
Give him some air.

03:13.335 --> 03:14.433
He's dead!

03:25.302 --> 03:27.945
Julia. Sir. What have we?

03:27.945 --> 03:30.462
Robert Semple, star player
for the University team.

03:30.496 --> 03:32.202
Dropped dead on the
field after a hard tackle.

03:32.238 --> 03:34.961
I believe he was stabbed.
I discovered a wound.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.067
Stabbed?

03:36.253 --> 03:38.436
Sir, you mentioned he was tackled.

03:38.612 --> 03:40.512
Could the other player
have concealed a weapon?

03:40.632 --> 03:42.313
This is football, Murdoch, not rugby.

03:42.318 --> 03:43.947
The lad tackled him with his legs.

03:44.067 --> 03:46.726
There was no way that Semple here
was stabbed on the field of play.

03:46.992 --> 03:48.863
I agree. Based on the inflammation,

03:48.885 --> 03:50.235
the wound is at least an hour old,

03:50.252 --> 03:51.718
possibly as much as twelve.

03:51.838 --> 03:54.789
He was stabbed and got kitted
up to play. I'm impressed.

03:54.909 --> 03:57.588
He should have been in a
hospital, not a football field!

03:57.611 --> 03:59.852
Will you be able to narrow
that timeline at all?

03:59.880 --> 04:02.198
I'll do my best, but
I can't guarantee it.

04:04.230 --> 04:05.407
Hm!

04:06.132 --> 04:08.166
(indistinct conversations)

04:08.201 --> 04:11.316
(birds chirping)

04:11.349 --> 04:14.472
Murdoch, meet my oldest
Canadian friend. Nobby!

04:14.713 --> 04:16.483
So called because of his knobby knees.

04:16.483 --> 04:18.581
- Detective Murdoch.
- Or my last name:

04:19.184 --> 04:20.451
Andrew Nobson.

04:20.571 --> 04:23.415
Sorry to meet you under such
unfortunate circumstances.

04:23.449 --> 04:24.618
Indeed.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.108
- You're the trainer for the Galt team?
- I am.

04:27.373 --> 04:30.151
Did any of your players
have contact with Mr. Semple

04:30.190 --> 04:31.457
in the last twelve hours?

04:31.468 --> 04:34.793
Well, we hosted a smoking concert
last night, for both teams.

04:34.913 --> 04:38.174
I stayed away, so the lads
could enjoy themselves fully.

04:38.501 --> 04:40.498
I imagine they would
have met Semple then.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.583
- Any animosities that you're aware of?
- No.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.724
No, they're good lads, focused
on nothing but the Olympic Games.

04:46.746 --> 04:48.632
I can vouch for the lot. Of course.

04:48.693 --> 04:50.942
Don't you worry, Nobby.
I'll come find you later.

04:51.869 --> 04:54.265
Alright, then. So, let's
start with the Toronto captain,

04:54.292 --> 04:55.991
- Wesley Patten.
- Sir.

04:56.909 --> 04:59.161
<i>Sure,</i> I was
with Robert last night.

04:59.177 --> 05:00.788
So was everyone else here.

05:00.908 --> 05:02.907
At the Galt football
team's smoking concert?

05:02.973 --> 05:04.805
A good fifty people were there.

05:04.925 --> 05:06.331
What time did you leave?

05:06.451 --> 05:09.216
Around eleven o'clock,
just like everyone else.

05:09.336 --> 05:10.910
And Mr. Semple?

05:11.030 --> 05:12.650
That was the last I saw him,

05:12.838 --> 05:14.874
until we all got to
the field this morning,

05:14.885 --> 05:16.114
around nine o'clock.

05:16.186 --> 05:17.746
And did you notice anything

05:17.818 --> 05:19.943
unusual about Mr. Semple this morning?

05:20.253 --> 05:21.454
He was tired.

05:21.509 --> 05:23.589
Robert's never been a morning person.

05:24.077 --> 05:27.170
Where was Mr. Semple between
the hours of eleven, last night,

05:27.213 --> 05:28.725
and nine AM, this morning?

05:29.672 --> 05:31.763
Esther Fields might know.

05:32.151 --> 05:33.960
She's Robert's sweetheart.

05:35.599 --> 05:37.226
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

05:37.762 --> 05:39.239
He was fine last night.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.297
His typical self.

05:41.663 --> 05:44.157
What time was it when you
left Mr. Semple last night?

05:44.363 --> 05:47.594
I suppose it was around
two or so, this morning.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.982
We went to a speakeasy
after the concert.

05:50.102 --> 05:51.600
I'm ashamed to admit it.

05:51.888 --> 05:53.421
Which speakeasy was this?

05:53.675 --> 05:55.977
The one at College and Brunswick Avenue.

05:56.652 --> 05:59.511
I don't know the name of
it. I'd never been before.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.997
Did Mr. Semple also leave when you did?

06:02.053 --> 06:03.237
I doubt it.

06:03.857 --> 06:05.467
He was in fine form,

06:05.587 --> 06:07.443
refusing to walk me home...

06:07.563 --> 06:09.307
in favour of more drink.

06:10.326 --> 06:11.830
I don't know where he went.

06:12.256 --> 06:13.651
Nor should I like to.

06:23.665 --> 06:24.836
Dr. Ogden.

06:25.209 --> 06:26.637
Look at this.

06:29.232 --> 06:30.433
Thread?!

06:34.613 --> 06:36.447
This wound was stitched.

06:37.371 --> 06:38.908
Badly, at that.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.901
The needle marks are quite jagged.

06:42.134 --> 06:44.790
I daresay you would
do a much better job.

06:45.354 --> 06:46.754
I'm not so certain.

06:46.986 --> 06:48.808
I've never been much of a seamstress.

06:49.050 --> 06:50.826
It's a bad business, Tom.

06:50.946 --> 06:52.580
Bad for both teams.

06:52.928 --> 06:54.660
What will you do about the match?

06:54.682 --> 06:56.863
It has to be replayed.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.557
The apple doesn't fall too far, eh?

06:59.767 --> 07:02.008
- He's got promise, that one.
- (Tom laughs a little.)

07:07.113 --> 07:10.078
(groaning with effort and sighing)

07:10.116 --> 07:12.401
Can't kick a ball
straight to save his life.

07:12.457 --> 07:13.923
He's still young.

07:14.095 --> 07:15.987
He can practice with
us while we're here.

07:16.374 --> 07:17.870
I doubt it will do any good,

07:17.907 --> 07:19.882
but that's very kind of you nonetheless.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.481
Just what old friends do!

07:22.393 --> 07:24.656
(grunts and chuckles)

07:27.323 --> 07:30.239
Ah! Sirs, I have the
soccer team rosters here.

07:30.267 --> 07:31.977
You mean the football team rosters.

07:32.097 --> 07:33.564
Yes, I mean the same, sir.

07:33.586 --> 07:37.277
"Soccer" is a term nicknamed
by some Oxford chap.

07:37.310 --> 07:39.657
Apparently, it means "association".

07:39.861 --> 07:41.294
As in association football.

07:41.310 --> 07:44.270
Some Toronto lad was using the
term. It seems to be catching on.

07:44.724 --> 07:47.269
I will not have you copying
some toffee-nosed prat

07:47.292 --> 07:49.123
repeating another toffee nosed prat.

07:49.140 --> 07:51.940
The sport is called football,
Crabtree, plain and simple.

07:51.978 --> 07:54.264
Sir, should the nickname not be adopted?

07:54.281 --> 07:56.509
I mean, we already have
another sport known as football.

07:57.003 --> 07:58.757
It is somewhat confusing.

07:59.553 --> 08:01.960
Should a sport wherein the
players pick up the ball

08:01.993 --> 08:04.302
in their hands and run down
the field be called football,

08:04.336 --> 08:06.504
or should it be the
sport wherein the players

08:06.539 --> 08:09.541
- kick a ball with their feet?!
- (Georges groans dubiously.)

08:09.842 --> 08:11.639
George, why don't you walk us through

08:11.655 --> 08:14.903
- Robert Semple's final hours?
- Sir, gladly. Um...

08:15.307 --> 08:17.095
At eight PM, he arrived
with his teammates

08:17.123 --> 08:19.220
at the town hall for
the smoking concert.

08:19.340 --> 08:21.516
He stayed there for the
duration, until eleven.

08:21.527 --> 08:23.888
- He didn't leave at all?
- Nobody saw him leave, sir.

08:23.951 --> 08:26.137
And I don't doubt it. What a show!

08:26.153 --> 08:29.108
There was a boxing match and
not one, but two strong men.

08:29.152 --> 08:32.144
Uh... champagne, a full steak dinner!

08:32.179 --> 08:34.900
I wonder at the wisdom of a heavy meal

08:34.953 --> 08:38.220
and alcohol the night before
an important sporting event.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.003
A night out is a good
way to unwind, Murdoch.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.431
Keeps the body limber.

08:42.597 --> 08:45.147
It's why the English are the
best footballers in the world!

08:46.818 --> 08:48.184
- Carry on, George.
- Right.

08:48.217 --> 08:50.292
After the smoking concert
broke up at eleven,

08:50.308 --> 08:52.721
Mr. Semple and a few friends
carried on to a speakeasy

08:52.749 --> 08:54.127
at College Street and Brunswick Avenue.

08:54.154 --> 08:55.399
The lads are searching there now.

08:55.416 --> 08:57.756
- Where did Semple go next?
- Well, we don't know, sir.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.826
Nobody saw hide nor
hair of him after two AM

08:59.848 --> 09:01.563
until he showed up at
the field this morning.

09:02.094 --> 09:04.955
Cause of death was shock
due to rupture of the liver.

09:05.431 --> 09:07.119
Do we know how that happened?

09:07.800 --> 09:10.095
It appears the liver
was nicked by the knife,

09:10.117 --> 09:12.059
which itself would not have been fatal.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.008
But when he collided
with the Galt player,

09:15.040 --> 09:17.421
I believe the nick tore
open and the liver ruptured.

09:17.809 --> 09:20.078
His body went into
arrest, stopping his heart.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.281
I won't be telling that to the
young Galt player who tackled him.

09:23.491 --> 09:24.742
Was he not in pain?

09:24.750 --> 09:26.934
Given the amount of
alcohol in his blood,

09:26.968 --> 09:29.844
he was likely inebriated enough
to dull the pain significantly.

09:29.964 --> 09:31.072
What about the weapon?

09:31.116 --> 09:33.202
The weapon appears to be
an average dinner knife.

09:33.385 --> 09:35.731
One used to eat a steak
dinner, for example?

09:35.764 --> 09:38.038
That would be consistent
with his injuries, yes.

09:38.165 --> 09:39.720
As for when the wound was inflicted,

09:39.742 --> 09:41.717
I believe Miss James
and I did rather well.

09:42.569 --> 09:45.313
The wound was still in
haemostasis and appeared...

09:45.604 --> 09:48.873
fairly new, meaning it
occurred within twelve hours.

09:49.069 --> 09:51.151
There is some discolouration,
which can begin

09:51.184 --> 09:53.711
four to six hours after
the bruise first appears.

09:53.746 --> 09:55.715
Combine that with the
rate of inflammation

09:55.748 --> 09:57.015
and the beginnings of scabbing and...

09:57.032 --> 09:58.758
Perhaps you might cut
to Hecuba, Miss James.

09:58.786 --> 10:00.893
Yes, yes. Of course, Inspector.

10:01.153 --> 10:02.803
We believe Mr. Semple was stabbed

10:02.819 --> 10:04.778
six to eight hours before his death.

10:04.977 --> 10:08.159
So the stabbing occurred
between two and four AM,

10:08.181 --> 10:10.539
likely with a knife that was
stolen from the town hall.

10:10.705 --> 10:12.879
Also, he may have seen a
friend after the stabbing.

10:13.305 --> 10:14.921
- How is that?
- We found remnants

10:14.948 --> 10:17.201
of thread inside the
wound and puncture marks,

10:17.236 --> 10:18.694
consistent with a sewing needle.

10:18.738 --> 10:20.913
But the stitching was not
done by a professional.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.358
Mr. Semple tried to stitch himself up?

10:23.375 --> 10:26.191
- I highly doubt it.
- So, he got a friend to help.

10:26.462 --> 10:28.786
But why not report it? Why
pretend it never happened?

10:29.312 --> 10:31.812
He didn't want anyone to
know that he'd been attacked?

10:31.840 --> 10:34.368
- Perhaps out of pride?
- Or he wished to keep secret

10:34.385 --> 10:37.151
the reason for the attack,
out of shame or guilt.

10:37.173 --> 10:38.275
Possibly.

10:38.391 --> 10:40.831
Either way, it would have
cost him his chance at glory.

10:41.158 --> 10:43.175
No athlete worth his salt
would want to miss a shot

10:43.200 --> 10:45.091
at the Olympic Games,
no matter what the cost.

10:48.906 --> 10:50.300
What have you, George?

10:50.322 --> 10:51.451
Ah, sirs.

10:51.495 --> 10:53.687
I enquired at the town hall.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.707
They say catering is missing a knife

10:55.734 --> 10:58.434
but that's not entirely uncommon
after such a large function.

10:58.469 --> 11:01.179
In fact, they engrave the hilts
of their knives with "H&L,"

11:01.201 --> 11:02.827
in order to discourage such theft.

11:02.866 --> 11:04.632
Tell the lads to add
that to their search.

11:04.654 --> 11:07.404
Sir, I will do. But no knife
of any sort has been found.

11:07.614 --> 11:10.392
This is a list of all those
who accompanied the victim

11:10.403 --> 11:12.318
to the speakeasy after
the smoking concert?

11:12.346 --> 11:14.642
That's right, sir. Esther Fields,

11:14.659 --> 11:18.244
Harriet Harcourt, Leland
Harcourt and Jack Gourlay.

11:18.471 --> 11:20.640
The last two are Galt
players. Are you certain?

11:20.678 --> 11:22.492
- Quite certain, sir.
- They've all said as much.

11:22.693 --> 11:25.818
Uh, Esther Fields is
the victim's sweetheart.

11:25.984 --> 11:29.482
Harriet Harcourt is Miss
Fields' bosom friend.

11:29.602 --> 11:31.855
Leland Harcourt is a Galt player,

11:31.871 --> 11:34.251
also Harriet Harcourt's brother.

11:34.268 --> 11:36.907
- Harriet Harcourt is from Galt.
- That's right, sir.

11:37.027 --> 11:40.657
And of course, Jack Gourlay
is Galt's team captain.

11:40.691 --> 11:44.729
- Fine player, too.
- He is also Harriet Harcourt's fiancé.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.763
- It's rather a tangled web.
- Indeed.

11:46.883 --> 11:48.608
They are all connected to each other,

11:48.632 --> 11:51.314
but only Miss Fields is
connected to the victim.

11:51.851 --> 11:53.627
What motive could the Galt lads

11:53.644 --> 11:55.027
have against a Toronto player?

11:55.094 --> 11:57.135
Well, sir, Robert Semple is Toronto's
best player. Take him out and you're off

11:57.179 --> 12:00.233
- Well, sir, Robert Semple to the Olympic Games.
- Exactly.

12:00.510 --> 12:01.556
But if I'm Robert Semple

12:01.595 --> 12:03.758
and I'm being stabbed by
my opponent, I report it.

12:03.979 --> 12:06.563
Galt's disqualified and I'm
off to the Olympic Games.

12:06.590 --> 12:07.780
But that didn't happen.

12:07.900 --> 12:10.035
So it had to be one of
the lads on his own team.

12:10.107 --> 12:12.602
But no Toronto players
were with the victim

12:12.641 --> 12:14.865
- at that late hour.
- And there's our conundrum, Murdoch.

12:15.352 --> 12:18.229
Crabtree, I want you to search every
nook and cranny of that speakeasy.

12:18.229 --> 12:20.786
Find the knife. Murdoch,
talk to the ladies.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.977
I'll have a word with the Galt players.

12:25.217 --> 12:26.703
Mr. Harcourt,

12:26.737 --> 12:28.719
what time did you leave
the speakeasy last night?

12:28.754 --> 12:29.971
About one o'clock, I think.

12:30.091 --> 12:32.185
I walked my sister home
then went back to my rooms.

12:32.533 --> 12:34.005
How well did you know the deceased?

12:34.038 --> 12:36.345
- I only met Semple last night.
- Tom!

12:36.710 --> 12:38.890
- So glad you're here.
- Just a moment, Nobby.

12:39.371 --> 12:41.103
Did you notice anything unusual?

12:41.125 --> 12:42.935
Just his general demeanour
was not very pleasant.

12:42.990 --> 12:45.341
Though I gather that
wasn't particularly unusual.

12:45.596 --> 12:47.549
- I don't know what else I can tell you.
- Thank you.

12:47.669 --> 12:49.060
Rejoin the practice.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.477
- I'll talk to Gourlay next.
- Of course,

12:51.504 --> 12:53.663
but Tom, while I have you here,
I could really use your help

12:53.685 --> 12:54.896
with the lads' tackling.

12:55.732 --> 12:58.232
- I wish I could, Nobby.
- Just a quick demonstration.

12:58.454 --> 13:00.025
You always were the best.

13:00.070 --> 13:03.054
- You had it down to a science.
- An art, more like.

13:03.101 --> 13:04.108
Oh, go on then,

13:04.130 --> 13:05.906
I can spare you a couple of minutes.

13:05.973 --> 13:08.064
Right then, Lads! Be prepared to learn

13:08.078 --> 13:10.127
the art of the Brackenreid slide tackle!

13:10.188 --> 13:11.581
(chuckle)

13:12.358 --> 13:14.986
I knew Robert Semple because of Esther.

13:15.058 --> 13:17.260
I don't know why she stayed with him.

13:17.555 --> 13:19.285
Why do you say that, Miss Harcourt?

13:19.893 --> 13:21.941
He wasn't very attentive to her.

13:22.061 --> 13:23.075
Ah.

13:23.861 --> 13:26.196
Tell me about last
night, as you remember it.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.364
There isn't much to tell.

13:28.399 --> 13:29.946
I only went to the smoking concert

13:29.946 --> 13:31.842
because Jack and Leland are in town.

13:31.962 --> 13:34.535
- Your brother and your fiancé.
- Yes.

13:34.933 --> 13:37.073
Leland warned me about Toronto.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.098
But I so wanted to live here.

13:39.623 --> 13:42.854
Jack was so good to wait to
marry until I finished my studies.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.028
But Leland was right:

13:45.454 --> 13:47.932
It's too dangerous here for a Galt girl.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.088
Where did you go after
the smoking concert?

13:53.052 --> 13:55.132
I walked with them to the speakeasy,

13:55.159 --> 13:57.694
but I was tired. I
didn't even go inside.

13:58.508 --> 14:00.434
Did you see anything unusual?

14:01.015 --> 14:03.427
Anyone angry with Mr. Semple?

14:03.997 --> 14:05.768
Esther was.

14:06.056 --> 14:09.204
But... I don't know if
that counts as unusual.

14:10.823 --> 14:12.739
(grunts)

14:12.859 --> 14:14.516
It's a lost cause, Nobby.

14:14.578 --> 14:17.747
- You're better off not tackling at all.
- Blasted free kicks.

14:17.781 --> 14:19.983
I wish we could just
brick up the bloody net.

14:20.512 --> 14:23.237
Good lord! It's that simple!

14:23.562 --> 14:26.656
Lads! Six of you, shoulder to shoulder!

♪

14:29.493 --> 14:32.929

Why are we making a wall of men?

14:34.850 --> 14:37.008
It's not a wall, it's a barricade.

14:37.029 --> 14:39.416
Against free kicks: your team weakness.

14:39.536 --> 14:41.437
This must be against
the laws of the game.

14:41.472 --> 14:43.745
The opposing players must
stand at least six yards away

14:43.773 --> 14:45.356
from the ball during a free kick.

14:45.392 --> 14:48.005
Yes, but it doesn't say
how many opposing players.

14:48.386 --> 14:50.282
Why has no one thought of this before?

14:50.316 --> 14:52.163
Because it's the height of foolishness.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.507
- I don't want a ball aimed at my face.
- Or my head!

14:54.528 --> 14:56.886
It takes an hour to
brilliantine my hair into place.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.356
Tom, perhaps this is a bit
much. I can't ask the lads

14:59.376 --> 15:01.147
to put themselves in
harm's way like this.

15:01.175 --> 15:02.828
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.108
The fabled Galt
Porridge-Eating Invincibles

15:05.109 --> 15:06.859
scared of a little old football?

15:06.979 --> 15:09.210
Hardly the attitude
of Olympic champions!

15:09.210 --> 15:11.306
I'll show you the
attitude of a champion.

15:11.426 --> 15:12.876
John Brackenreid!

15:13.789 --> 15:16.420
- Me?
- Get in the barricade.

15:17.012 --> 15:19.537
Right, lads. Flank him either side.

15:21.778 --> 15:23.901
- But Father...
- Tom!

15:24.634 --> 15:25.848
Ready?

15:30.285 --> 15:32.235
- OH!
- (moaning)

15:32.415 --> 15:34.421
Good lord, are you all right?

15:34.442 --> 15:35.900
'Course he's all right. Get up, John.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.230
I don't believe it. It worked!

15:38.241 --> 15:40.809
- Your barricade worked, Tom!
- Of course it worked.

15:40.825 --> 15:42.983
Now you can give away all
the free kicks you like.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.382
Right. My work here is done.

15:45.502 --> 15:47.608
Better get back to some real work.

15:49.340 --> 15:51.039
(runners panting)

15:51.159 --> 15:54.026
Miss Fields, you neglected to
mention that you had an argument

15:54.044 --> 15:56.034
with Mr. Semple last night.

15:56.344 --> 15:57.937
There was nothing to mention.

15:58.690 --> 16:00.505
It's somewhat of a daily thing.

16:01.051 --> 16:03.019
Or was, I suppose.

16:03.053 --> 16:04.671
What was the argument about?

16:05.263 --> 16:07.104
Just his usual behaviour.

16:08.511 --> 16:10.159
He refused to walk me home,

16:10.194 --> 16:11.521
like I told you.

16:12.196 --> 16:14.697
He was too busy
drinking and showing off.

16:14.732 --> 16:16.245
Showing off for whom?

16:18.035 --> 16:19.382
Jack Gourlay.

16:20.367 --> 16:21.952
Harriet's fiancé.

16:22.426 --> 16:24.993
As much of a drunken
lout as the rest of them.

16:27.704 --> 16:30.637
I think Semple and I
parted ways about 2:30,

16:30.676 --> 16:32.064
though I wouldn't swear to it.

16:32.184 --> 16:34.648
And that was the last you
saw of him until this morning?

16:34.720 --> 16:36.667
Right. Or, perhaps not.

16:36.679 --> 16:39.158
- Explain, Mr. Gourley.
- After I left the speakeasy

16:39.189 --> 16:40.364
I got a bit turned around.

16:40.552 --> 16:43.274
I managed to find my way
back there and I saw someone,

16:43.308 --> 16:45.499
who I think was Semple,
stumbling out of a laneway.

16:45.533 --> 16:47.790
I called out but he didn't turn around.

16:47.846 --> 16:49.179
Maybe it wasn't him.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.944
What laneway was this?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.499
Outside the speakeasy?

16:53.174 --> 16:55.509
I don't know. It's my
first time to Toronto.

16:55.539 --> 16:57.900
Uh, I think I saw...
something that looked

16:57.933 --> 17:00.410
like over-large thimble.
You could ask Wesley.

17:00.584 --> 17:02.614
Wesley Patten? The Toronto captain?

17:02.681 --> 17:05.364
Well, yes. He's the one who took us
to the speakeasy in the first place.

17:06.084 --> 17:07.950
One! Two!

17:08.069 --> 17:09.470
Mr. Patten!

17:09.703 --> 17:10.864
A moment.

17:12.054 --> 17:14.848
Why is Galt practicing
so much with the ball?

17:14.871 --> 17:17.903
Everyone knows it lessens the
hunger for it come game day.

17:18.195 --> 17:19.226
Mr. Patten,

17:19.281 --> 17:21.997
football is the least of
your worries at the moment.

17:22.031 --> 17:23.121
You lied to me.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.835
You were at the speakeasy
with Robert Semple.

17:27.938 --> 17:30.137
- Right then. Off to the station house.
- All right.

17:30.530 --> 17:32.008
Yes, I lied.

17:32.527 --> 17:34.707
If it gets back to the
University that I went

17:34.711 --> 17:37.562
to an illegal establishment,
I'll be kicked off the team.

17:37.601 --> 17:39.015
Then why did you go in the first place?

17:39.049 --> 17:40.821
I had to keep an eye on Robert.

17:40.871 --> 17:42.570
Well, you didn't do
a very good job of it.

17:42.598 --> 17:44.678
Don't think I don't know that.

17:44.867 --> 17:46.847
I wouldn't normally
leave him in that state,

17:46.857 --> 17:49.360
but we had a big match in a
few hours, and I needed sleep.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.110
- What time did you leave?
- Just before 2 AM.

17:52.177 --> 17:54.026
And that's the last
you saw of Mr. Semple?

17:54.058 --> 17:55.126
Yes.

17:55.879 --> 17:57.710
That's the truth, I swear it.

18:02.286 --> 18:03.304
Sir.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.390
Ah, Murdoch.

18:05.510 --> 18:08.655
I've finally found a good use
for your chalkboard: tactics.

18:08.694 --> 18:11.344
- Tactics?
- Formations, Murdoch, formations.

18:11.532 --> 18:13.995
See, this is the standard 2-3-5.

18:14.115 --> 18:15.594
The pyramid formation.

18:15.714 --> 18:18.223
But on this side is my invention:

18:18.450 --> 18:19.744
the 4-4-2.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.074
- Oh!
- The more I watch football,

18:22.101 --> 18:23.917
the more I've come to
realize the importance

18:23.939 --> 18:25.057
of a good defense.

18:25.084 --> 18:26.385
You can't win football games

18:26.401 --> 18:27.862
if you're constantly letting goals in.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.711
I suppose so, but if
you bolster your defense

18:30.717 --> 18:32.615
at the expense of your offense,

18:32.735 --> 18:34.672
you won't be scoring many goals, either.

18:34.705 --> 18:37.766
I know, I know. The 2-3-5
does make more sense.

18:38.779 --> 18:40.417
I just can't think anymore.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.211
So, where are we at?

18:42.246 --> 18:44.627
Well, sir, Jack Gourlay saw someone

18:44.650 --> 18:46.491
stumbling out into the laneway.

18:46.691 --> 18:48.317
Well, that could have been Semple.

18:49.108 --> 18:51.301
Or it could have been his attacker.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.584
If Semple was stabbed
outside the speakeasy,

18:53.624 --> 18:55.465
we would surely have found
evidence of it by now.

18:55.585 --> 18:58.692
Well, I don't believe he was
stabbed outside the speakeasy.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.397
But...

19:01.238 --> 19:02.698
somewhere nearby.

it. Good work, Murdoch.

19:08.723 --> 19:10.701
And only a block away
from the speakeasy.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.657
- Mr. Patten?
- Detective.

20:53.073 --> 20:54.340
Tom!

20:58.246 --> 21:00.044
What am I doing here, Tom?

21:00.216 --> 21:02.075
You know what you're doing here, Nobby.

21:02.195 --> 21:04.056
The blood trail led right to your hotel.

21:04.078 --> 21:05.633
I don't know anything about it.

21:05.644 --> 21:08.549
I wasn't even out the night
that poor lad was stabbed.

21:08.715 --> 21:10.004
You know it's the truth.

21:10.037 --> 21:11.183
Are all your players

21:11.244 --> 21:14.858
- staying at the same hotel with you?
- No. They're all billeted.

21:15.282 --> 21:17.443
Look, I can see what you're thinking.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.239
It's far too great a coincidence

21:19.244 --> 21:21.547
that the victim's blood ended
up on the steps of my hotel...

21:21.575 --> 21:23.993
- That is the sum of it, yes.
- Come now, Tom.

21:24.452 --> 21:26.117
You've known me for years.

21:26.150 --> 21:28.120
- You know the type of man I am.
- Nobby...

21:28.142 --> 21:30.073
And you know I've no time
for anything other than

21:30.090 --> 21:32.922
preparing my team for the biggest
competition of their lives.

21:33.448 --> 21:35.904
It's not every day the
Olympic Games come calling.

21:37.321 --> 21:38.865
Murdoch.

21:41.576 --> 21:42.744
Sir,

21:42.766 --> 21:45.294
perhaps Mr. Nobson is telling the truth.

21:45.466 --> 21:48.248
He's involved in some way,
whether he knows it or not.

21:49.106 --> 21:51.480
I've sent George to search
along both blood trails

21:51.491 --> 21:52.766
for the murder weapon.

21:54.047 --> 21:55.955
What if someone is trying to lay blame

21:55.978 --> 21:58.008
on Nobby or the Galt team in general?

21:58.368 --> 22:00.830
Perhaps we should speak
with the person at the end

22:00.847 --> 22:03.032
- of the other blood trail.
- The Toronto captain.

22:03.152 --> 22:04.415
Wesley Patten.

22:06.434 --> 22:09.836
(dramatic music)

22:10.722 --> 22:14.608
<i>We found Robert Semple's</i> blood
in a laneway behind the speakeasy.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.608
Two blood trails diverged
from that laneway.

22:17.887 --> 22:19.822
One went to Mr. Nobson's hotel,

22:20.251 --> 22:21.822
the other to your residence.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.564
I can explain that.

22:23.886 --> 22:26.472
At least, I can explain half of it.

22:26.906 --> 22:27.809
Please!

22:28.154 --> 22:30.872
I did leave the speakeasy
earlier than Robert,

22:30.889 --> 22:32.931
like I told you. I just...

22:33.267 --> 22:35.047
didn't tell you what
happened afterwards.

22:35.065 --> 22:37.096
Which makes it the second
time you've lied to us

22:37.101 --> 22:38.850
in as many conversations.

22:39.571 --> 22:42.010
Talk! The truth this time.

22:42.939 --> 22:46.723
Maybe an hour after I
got home, around three,

22:46.984 --> 22:49.547
Robert showed up at my door, bleeding.

22:49.609 --> 22:52.376
- Why didn't you go fetch a doctor?
- He wouldn't let me.

22:52.558 --> 22:53.890
If we'd gone to hospital,

22:53.907 --> 22:56.342
he wouldn't have been able
to play the match. And...

22:57.237 --> 22:59.578
I'm ashamed to say, we needed him.

22:59.654 --> 23:01.460
And the cut looked small enough.

23:01.487 --> 23:03.005
So, you sewed it shut?

23:03.063 --> 23:04.200
I insisted.

23:04.696 --> 23:06.515
In the morning he
wasn't any worse for wear

23:06.524 --> 23:08.100
than after any other night out.

23:08.126 --> 23:10.246
He really did seem fine.

23:10.366 --> 23:13.105
You don't seem to be
taking his death very hard.

23:14.410 --> 23:16.501
It's a terrible thing to say,

23:16.621 --> 23:18.506
but I'm almost relieved he's gone.

23:18.701 --> 23:19.901
Why do you say that?

23:20.193 --> 23:23.655
The University expects us to
conduct ourselves like gentlemen.

23:23.823 --> 23:25.638
Robert was no gentleman.

23:26.113 --> 23:29.228
I was tired of my future on
the team being tied up with his.

23:29.263 --> 23:31.405
Never mind how he treated poor Esther.

23:31.427 --> 23:32.656
How did he treat her?

23:33.148 --> 23:36.928
A rumour went around the smoking
concert that he'd been unfaithful.

23:37.558 --> 23:38.828
Just a rumour?

23:38.872 --> 23:40.010
I doubt it.

23:40.130 --> 23:42.979
Seeing as it was spread
about by Robert himself.

23:51.472 --> 23:52.894
Why did you put up with him?

23:53.186 --> 23:54.731
You're a pleasant young thing.

23:54.780 --> 23:56.652
Surely you could attract a better beau.

23:57.631 --> 24:01.060
I wouldn't expect a man to
understand a woman's burdens.

24:01.671 --> 24:04.111
You were aware of his
indiscretions, then?

24:06.408 --> 24:07.674
Unfortunately.

24:07.900 --> 24:10.693
That is the real reason you
were angry at Mr. Semple.

24:11.968 --> 24:14.580
You heard the rumour of his infidelity,

24:14.642 --> 24:16.146
at the smoking concert?

24:17.381 --> 24:18.988
So you took a knife from the dinner,

24:18.997 --> 24:21.299
waited till everyone left, and
then stabbed him in revenge.

24:21.312 --> 24:22.552
Of course not!

24:22.884 --> 24:24.601
I was angry, yes, but...

24:25.013 --> 24:26.266
I was more ashamed.

24:27.572 --> 24:29.670
I confronted him, I admit it.

24:29.861 --> 24:31.144
In front of everyone.

24:32.087 --> 24:33.464
And you know what he did?

24:34.252 --> 24:36.129
The bastard laughed.

24:36.771 --> 24:38.205
He laughed at me.

24:38.807 --> 24:39.839
I might have dismissed it

24:39.852 --> 24:42.162
as one of Robert's cruel jokes except...

24:42.348 --> 24:44.605
for her behaviour toward
me the past few weeks.

24:45.252 --> 24:47.554
Distant. Apologetic.

24:48.037 --> 24:49.458
Whose behaviour?

24:49.962 --> 24:51.556
Surely you know.

24:51.676 --> 24:53.322
It's been all over the university.

24:54.068 --> 24:55.598
<i>Harriet Harcourt.</i>

24:56.199 --> 24:58.770
(with a start): Detective! Inspector.

25:01.134 --> 25:03.183
My brother is waiting
for me at the field.

25:03.228 --> 25:04.963
Oh. Allow us to escort you.

25:05.778 --> 25:07.916
How is the investigation going?

25:08.036 --> 25:09.160
We are proceeding.

25:09.385 --> 25:11.094
Have you a suspect in mind?

25:11.385 --> 25:13.325
We have learned of
certain events recently

25:13.329 --> 25:15.375
that have narrowed our
search considerably.

25:15.419 --> 25:17.044
Which is why we need to speak to you.

25:17.415 --> 25:19.119
I'm sure I can't help you.

25:19.177 --> 25:21.350
Did you have an affair
with Robert Semple?

25:22.816 --> 25:25.440
(She starts crying.)

25:25.803 --> 25:27.729
Perhaps a bit direct, sir.

25:27.950 --> 25:28.977
Got a result, though.

25:29.043 --> 25:30.836
Certainly seemed like a yes to me.

25:31.306 --> 25:33.090
In that case, no one had more motive

25:33.094 --> 25:35.294
than the last man that was with Semple:

25:35.576 --> 25:36.685
Jack Gourlay.

25:36.805 --> 25:38.743
Beware a man cuckolded.

25:39.283 --> 25:40.297
Yes, sir.

25:40.656 --> 25:42.099
Ugh...

25:42.936 --> 25:44.122
(honking)

25:44.883 --> 25:46.826
Just how bad is a constable's salary

25:46.844 --> 25:49.301
that he is forced to forage
for his lunch in such a manner?

25:49.358 --> 25:51.687
Ha ha ha... Miss James!

25:51.700 --> 25:53.427
What a pleasant surprise.
Although, not for you,

25:53.440 --> 25:55.724
- considering the state I'm in.
- What are you doing?

25:55.964 --> 25:58.553
I'm looking... for the murder weapon.

25:58.717 --> 26:01.133
Detective Murdoch
discovered a trail of blood

26:01.155 --> 26:03.037
and I'm to follow the
route, checking every...

26:03.085 --> 26:05.612
garbage can and sewer hole.

26:05.732 --> 26:06.901
Perhaps I can help.

26:06.936 --> 26:08.410
I'm used to having my arms elbow-deep

26:08.423 --> 26:10.007
in arguably worse conditions.

26:10.029 --> 26:11.986
And I know the kind of
knife you're looking for.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.993
Both excellent points, Miss James.

26:15.188 --> 26:16.666
Consider yourself deputized.

26:17.095 --> 26:18.326
Where should I begin?

26:23.328 --> 26:24.490
Julia?!

26:25.081 --> 26:26.386
William!

26:26.745 --> 26:29.481
- What are you doing here?
- Mr. Nobson asked me

26:29.498 --> 26:32.013
if I could recommend a doctor
who could help out with the boys.

26:32.044 --> 26:33.497
So I offered my services.

26:34.050 --> 26:35.750
Oh, I fear you'll be overworked.

26:35.763 --> 26:38.432
I tell you, William, the way
these boys abuse their bodies,

26:38.463 --> 26:41.424
they should have a doctor
follow them everywhere they go!

26:41.584 --> 26:42.823
Indeed.

26:43.598 --> 26:44.722
Good!

26:45.205 --> 26:47.737
- (groan)
- Nobby!

26:49.454 --> 26:51.415
Tom. I am in the middle of practice.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.340
I've come to see Mr. Gourlay.

26:54.008 --> 26:55.039
Gourlay!

26:55.611 --> 26:57.691
The lads should go easy on
practicing the barricade.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.448
You don't want any injuries
before for the match.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.170
I can manage my team, thank you.

27:01.807 --> 27:03.002
Put John in the middle.

27:03.033 --> 27:04.623
John, get yourself up here.

27:04.743 --> 27:06.066
Let him take the brunt of it.

27:06.517 --> 27:08.806
Lads, practice aiming
your kicks at John.

27:09.793 --> 27:12.259
(panting): I wish I could, Father, but

27:12.304 --> 27:14.162
I've hurt my ankle, I can barely stand.

27:14.282 --> 27:15.588
(with a big sigh)

27:15.938 --> 27:18.412
Go and see Dr. Ogden on the sidelines.

27:18.744 --> 27:21.073
Mr. Gourlay, you're coming with me.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.703
I have been jealous of Harriet, I admit.

27:25.823 --> 27:28.505
She's been in the city, having
all sorts of adventures...

27:28.735 --> 27:31.210
I've been working at my
father's dry goods store in Galt.

27:31.684 --> 27:34.065
You must have been looking
forward to this trip.

27:34.123 --> 27:36.965
Oh yes! The match, the smoking concert.

27:37.431 --> 27:38.909
But most of all, Harriet.

27:39.081 --> 27:41.511
Yes, your visit with Miss Harcourt

27:41.538 --> 27:43.627
hasn't gone exactly as you expected.

27:43.747 --> 27:45.392
Harriet's been so cold.

27:45.512 --> 27:47.870
So odd. She won't talk
to me, she won't touch me.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.797
She didn't even want to
go to the smoking concert.

27:49.881 --> 27:52.381
She needn't have bothered, she
was a wet blanket all evening.

27:52.408 --> 27:54.015
You must have heard the rumour.

27:54.192 --> 27:55.652
Semple and your fiancée.

27:55.679 --> 27:58.260
It's a pack of lies.
I said so to his face.

27:58.525 --> 28:01.283
He was no Toronto gentleman.
He wouldn't even apologize.

28:01.358 --> 28:04.085
- It made you angry.
- I couldn't just let it go.

28:05.032 --> 28:07.356
Though I'm ashamed of what
happened on the field the next day.

28:07.551 --> 28:08.530
The tackle, you mean.

28:08.769 --> 28:11.053
- It was a hard one.
- Unsporting.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.558
And I'd already made my
feelings known the night before.

28:13.607 --> 28:16.059
The two of you fought at the speakeasy?

28:16.117 --> 28:17.874
We were both so drunk neither of us

28:17.883 --> 28:20.424
managed to land a single
blow. We agreed to let

28:20.485 --> 28:22.765
the match settle our grievances.

28:24.074 --> 28:26.921
Why did you leave all of this
out of your earlier account?

28:29.191 --> 28:32.188
I'm not normally one to
stoop to a barroom brawl.

28:32.573 --> 28:34.887
I'm the captain of
the Galt football team.

28:35.007 --> 28:37.057
And I may well soon be an Olympian.

28:37.336 --> 28:39.311
It's no light responsibility.

28:41.360 --> 28:43.400
- (shouts from the game)
- It's my left ankle.

28:45.109 --> 28:46.826
But you were limping with your right.

28:49.987 --> 28:51.705
John, do you not want to play?

28:52.170 --> 28:53.440
I do want to play.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.516
Just not my father's way.

28:56.206 --> 28:58.371
But a Brackenreid plays
like a true Englishman.

28:58.491 --> 29:00.443
And a Brackenreid tackles at the knees.

29:01.133 --> 29:03.032
A Brackenreid brawls
on the field and off.

29:04.209 --> 29:07.096
Surely there can be more
than one kind of Brackenreid.

29:07.216 --> 29:08.708
Not according to my father. Hm!

29:11.451 --> 29:13.545
Your father is a fair man,

29:13.722 --> 29:16.112
if a little pigheaded at times.

29:17.097 --> 29:19.428
But you are old enough
to be your own man, John.

29:22.850 --> 29:24.381
But in the meantime,

29:24.748 --> 29:26.036
I'll wrap your foot

29:26.058 --> 29:27.856
and we'll keep up your pretense.

29:28.409 --> 29:30.369
At least until you can
build up a little of that...

29:30.405 --> 29:32.415
infamous Brackenreid courage.

29:33.792 --> 29:35.855
I admit I don't know
much about football,

29:35.899 --> 29:37.696
but it does look quite fun.

29:37.864 --> 29:40.639
Oh, Miss James, I'm
sure you would excel.

29:41.166 --> 29:43.437
Surely, there is a ladies
team at the university.

29:43.796 --> 29:45.398
I don't think I'd be welcome.

29:46.739 --> 29:48.018
In that case...

29:49.558 --> 29:51.001
let's you and I have a go right now.

29:51.598 --> 29:52.740
I couldn't.

29:52.829 --> 29:55.029
There you are, come on. Nobody watching.

29:59.734 --> 30:01.381
Constable Crabtree!

30:03.949 --> 30:05.436
That looks like blood.

30:18.533 --> 30:19.577
Crabtree!

30:20.016 --> 30:20.892
Sir.

30:21.242 --> 30:22.752
There are no fingermarks on the knife.

30:22.756 --> 30:24.207
It's been thoroughly wiped cleaned.

30:24.287 --> 30:25.947
- Is that the murder weapon?
- Yes, sir.

30:26.067 --> 30:28.186
Rebecca James confirmed
a much, as does the

30:28.208 --> 30:29.284
engraving on the hilt.

30:29.505 --> 30:30.749
Where was it found?

30:31.320 --> 30:33.913
- Outside Andrew Nobson's hotel, sir.
- Oh...

30:34.728 --> 30:36.038
So we're back to Nobby.

30:36.140 --> 30:38.610
Or at least someone who
wants us to think it's Nobby.

30:38.902 --> 30:41.398
Sir, there's one more piece
of evidence you should see.

30:42.947 --> 30:44.133
(very hushed): Oh...

30:44.384 --> 30:45.373
A.N.

30:46.422 --> 30:47.635
Andrew Nobson.

30:50.424 --> 30:51.623
Protest, Nobby.

30:52.132 --> 30:53.349
Tell me it's not yours.

30:53.367 --> 30:54.495
Tell me we're wrong.

30:56.163 --> 30:57.753
Look, I'm on your side,

30:58.298 --> 31:00.609
but I need you to speak
up in your defence.

31:02.380 --> 31:03.893
Bloody hell, Andrew!

31:04.664 --> 31:06.628
All our years of friendship
have come to this?

31:07.735 --> 31:09.258
I'm sorry, Tom.

31:11.413 --> 31:12.767
Not as sorry as I am.

31:22.695 --> 31:24.585
Crabtree searched Nobby's room.

31:24.590 --> 31:27.379
His boots were caked with grass
and dirt but no trace of blood.

31:27.454 --> 31:29.256
He couldn't have been the
one to make the blood trail.

31:29.490 --> 31:32.439
- His guilt does seem unlikely.
- But until he speaks to us...

31:32.634 --> 31:33.877
He's protecting someone.

31:33.917 --> 31:35.768
I can't see any other
reason for his silence.

31:35.998 --> 31:37.929
Then we should re-examine
the Galt players,

31:37.933 --> 31:39.859
Jack Gourlay and Leland Harcourt.

31:40.102 --> 31:41.333
Gourlay has motive,

31:41.337 --> 31:43.877
seeing as his fiancé was the
one carrying on with the victim.

31:43.935 --> 31:46.365
But without Nobby's cooperation
we have nothing on him.

31:47.175 --> 31:49.290
Well, if Mr. Nobson won't speak to us,

31:49.473 --> 31:51.191
perhaps Miss Harcourt will.

31:51.585 --> 31:54.258
The last time we tried with
her she burst into tears.

31:55.687 --> 31:57.658
Ask the good doctor to lend you a hand.

32:00.906 --> 32:03.456
These past few days
must have been difficult?

32:03.757 --> 32:06.488
Having to mourn the loss
of a lover in secret.

32:06.931 --> 32:08.396
He wasn't my lover.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.910
I hated him.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.756
Mr. Semple told your fiancé

32:13.800 --> 32:15.836
of a dalliance the two of you shared.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.952
He told Jack that?

32:18.891 --> 32:20.184
Was it true?

32:21.454 --> 32:22.688
I can't deny it.

32:22.834 --> 32:25.530
But it only happened
once. A terrible mistake.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.071
Jack didn't kill Robert.

32:29.394 --> 32:32.231
- I know it.
- Your faith in him is admirable, but...

32:32.245 --> 32:34.077
I know it because I did it.

32:34.714 --> 32:36.570
I killed Robert Semple.

32:37.826 --> 32:40.698
Miss Harcourt, do you
realize what you're saying?

32:40.818 --> 32:41.854
I do.

32:42.593 --> 32:43.992
Robert attacked me.

32:44.439 --> 32:46.364
I stabbed him to defend myself.

32:48.020 --> 32:49.102
Where did this happen?

32:49.136 --> 32:50.383
In a laneway.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.361
And then you went to the speakeasy?

32:52.529 --> 32:54.464
Or... return to the speakeasy?

32:54.584 --> 32:56.385
Yes. Or...

32:57.067 --> 32:57.952
no.

32:58.736 --> 33:00.826
It was before the speakeasy.

33:01.379 --> 33:02.729
Or after. Um,

33:02.982 --> 33:05.324
- I don't recall.
- Take your time.

33:05.841 --> 33:07.098
Start at the beginning.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.444
It's all a blur.

33:08.909 --> 33:11.923
He attacked me, I
stabbed him. I went home.

33:12.043 --> 33:13.884
And what did you do with the knife?

33:14.220 --> 33:15.291
I left it there.

33:15.504 --> 33:16.615
In the laneway.

33:18.456 --> 33:21.573
Miss Harcourt, did you visit
Mr. Nobson that evening?

33:21.869 --> 33:23.998
No. Of course not.

33:24.648 --> 33:26.295
I stabbed Robert.

33:26.415 --> 33:29.429
No one else knew anything about
it. I'm the only guilty one.

33:31.275 --> 33:34.013
Miss Harcourt, I imagine
you could use a cup of tea.

33:34.635 --> 33:36.441
Please, excuse me.

33:47.945 --> 33:49.105
Miss Harcourt,

33:49.158 --> 33:50.973
your description of the incident

33:51.345 --> 33:53.146
doesn't match the evidence.

33:53.709 --> 33:55.601
I'm telling you I did it.

33:56.059 --> 33:57.370
Isn't that enough?

33:58.684 --> 34:00.721
You didn't stab Robert Semple.

34:01.779 --> 34:03.736
But he did attack you, didn't he?

34:05.971 --> 34:08.136
But perhaps not on
the night in question?

34:11.118 --> 34:14.744
You think by taking the
blame you'll feel better.

34:15.599 --> 34:17.290
But in my experience,

34:17.324 --> 34:19.768
it's only the truth
that brings you peace.

34:21.706 --> 34:22.871
Harriet.

34:23.246 --> 34:26.011
Whatever you tell me,
I will believe you.

34:32.556 --> 34:35.588
One evening I was
walking home from class.

34:36.571 --> 34:38.036
I ran into Robert.

34:38.581 --> 34:40.197
He was going to see Esther, he said,

34:40.210 --> 34:42.087
and would walk me to our residence.

34:42.485 --> 34:44.246
I agreed. Why wouldn't I?

34:46.855 --> 34:48.851
He said he needed to stop by his room.

34:48.971 --> 34:50.603
I was going to wait outside,

34:50.724 --> 34:53.047
but he offered to sneak me past the Don.

34:53.304 --> 34:54.380
It was cold,

34:54.956 --> 34:56.062
and I knew him.

34:57.802 --> 34:59.639
He took advantage of you in his room?

35:04.801 --> 35:06.598
It was all my fault.

35:07.820 --> 35:09.462
I went in willingly.

35:09.847 --> 35:12.317
I put myself in that position.

35:13.176 --> 35:15.323
I am entirely to blame.

35:15.969 --> 35:17.589
You told no one?

35:19.116 --> 35:21.255
I tried to pretend it didn't happen.

35:21.861 --> 35:23.956
Jack would have left me. My family...

35:23.991 --> 35:25.496
would have been disgraced.

35:25.907 --> 35:26.983
But Robert...

35:28.617 --> 35:30.679
Robert wouldn't let me forget.

35:31.458 --> 35:34.596
Which is why you didn't want
to go to the smoking concert,

35:34.972 --> 35:37.049
or join your friends at the speakeasy.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.599
I thought it would happen again.

35:39.975 --> 35:41.799
You took a knife from the dinner,

35:41.919 --> 35:43.352
to protect yourself.

35:44.504 --> 35:45.845
I would have used it.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.014
But you didn't.

35:49.164 --> 35:50.607
Mr. Gourlay did.

35:51.024 --> 35:51.909
No.

35:52.201 --> 35:54.490
I swear Jack had
nothing to do with this.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.415
Oh, Harriet.

35:59.009 --> 36:01.249
You've been protecting your brother.

36:01.595 --> 36:04.664
(sobbing)

36:04.999 --> 36:07.987
My sister was so frightened she
was walking around with a knife.

36:08.053 --> 36:09.514
You could have come to the police.

36:09.528 --> 36:11.337
And pit her word against
the great Robert Semple,

36:11.502 --> 36:13.455
hero of the University football team?

36:14.074 --> 36:15.492
He would have said she consented

36:15.505 --> 36:17.059
and the matter would have disappeared.

36:20.024 --> 36:21.636
You walked your sister home,

36:21.892 --> 36:23.613
- that much is true?
- Yes.

36:24.437 --> 36:26.127
She was so upset.

36:27.754 --> 36:29.572
I had to pry the knife out of her hand.

36:31.444 --> 36:33.577
<i>You then went to
find Robert Semple.</i>

36:33.825 --> 36:35.423
Hey, Semple!

36:35.468 --> 36:37.929
<i>I told him to leave Harriet</i>
<i>alone.</i> I'm talking to you!

36:38.935 --> 36:40.541
<i>He refused.</i>

36:40.944 --> 36:41.927
And?

36:42.219 --> 36:44.632
Leave her alone. <i>He said:</i>

36:44.933 --> 36:48.119
All girls play the innocent,
but it's just for show.

36:48.175 --> 36:50.801
(cry of rage, slide of knife and groans)

36:51.399 --> 36:53.352
<i>One moment the knife was
in my hand, the next... </i>

36:54.679 --> 36:56.176
it was sticking in Robert.

36:58.137 --> 37:00.219
You then ran to Mr. Nobson for help?

37:01.102 --> 37:02.394
He told me to go home,

37:03.403 --> 37:05.598
get my rest for the game.
It would all be all right.

37:06.993 --> 37:09.507
Then I saw Robert on the field
the next morning. I thought...

37:10.755 --> 37:12.556
maybe I'd dreamt the whole thing.

37:16.744 --> 37:18.536
I've let everyone down, haven't I?

37:20.843 --> 37:21.874
(knocking)

37:27.468 --> 37:30.149
(sad, melancholy music)

37:42.115 --> 37:44.943
- Go! Go!
- (grunts)

37:45.728 --> 37:46.852
Good, lads!

37:47.334 --> 37:48.419
Very good!

37:50.172 --> 37:51.070
(chuckles)

37:51.104 --> 37:52.207
That's it!

37:52.730 --> 37:53.858
That's it!

37:55.253 --> 37:56.758
Leland is a good lad.

37:57.448 --> 37:58.844
He just made a bad mistake.

37:59.727 --> 38:01.881
- As did you.
- I know, Tom.

38:02.755 --> 38:04.088
And I'm prepared to pay for it.

38:07.916 --> 38:09.722
Why do you only have
ten men on the field?

38:09.789 --> 38:11.624
We didn't travel with any substitutes.

38:12.259 --> 38:14.043
We have to play a man short.

38:16.256 --> 38:18.164
John, get yourself up here.

38:19.733 --> 38:21.412
He may only be a young man,

38:21.461 --> 38:22.931
but he's a man nonetheless.

38:26.759 --> 38:27.946
You're in, lad.

38:28.066 --> 38:29.207
Halfback.

38:30.481 --> 38:31.274
No.

38:31.308 --> 38:32.716
- What?
- I said no.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.921
I won't play unless I can play my way.

38:35.191 --> 38:36.182
What are you on about?

38:36.218 --> 38:39.095
I don't tackle, and I don't
run straight for the net.

38:39.596 --> 38:41.088
I won't kick long balls.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.389
I will pass and use my
teammates like the Scots,

38:43.407 --> 38:45.407
- because that's the way I play.
- Bloody hell.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.868
I may not be able to
kick a ball straight,

38:47.988 --> 38:49.476
but I'm a good player

38:49.763 --> 38:51.401
and I know the game as well as anyone.

38:51.857 --> 38:53.251
And I am a Brackenreid.

38:53.871 --> 38:55.649
Except I'm John Brackenreid,

38:56.238 --> 38:58.819
and there is room for more
than one kind of Brackenreid.

38:59.421 --> 39:00.957
No son, you're wrong.

39:01.551 --> 39:03.799
There is only one kind of Brackenreid.

39:05.747 --> 39:07.421
The one who speaks his mind.

39:07.947 --> 39:09.187
Now get out there

39:09.307 --> 39:11.616
and pass your way to
the Olympic bloody Games.

39:12.329 --> 39:16.021
(rising momentum in music)

39:19.810 --> 39:21.456
Pass it on! Pass it on!

39:22.448 --> 39:24.205
Let's go! Let's go!

39:26.959 --> 39:28.295
Bring it up! Bring it up!

39:28.672 --> 39:30.053
Pass it on!

39:31.080 --> 39:32.328
Shoot! Shoot!

39:32.527 --> 39:34.874
- YES!!
- (whistle blow)

39:35.197 --> 39:37.443
(acclamations)

39:38.114 --> 39:39.726
- Nice one!
- (chuckles)

39:39.846 --> 39:42.481
(triumphant music)

39:44.462 --> 39:47.034
Tackle him. Tackle him! On him!

39:48.099 --> 39:51.399
(whistle blow and cheering)

39:55.562 --> 39:57.278
Let's keep it going!

40:00.167 --> 40:02.101
One minute to go.

40:08.108 --> 40:09.678
Defense!

40:10.127 --> 40:12.321
- Foul, there!
- (whistle blow)

40:13.680 --> 40:15.599
Yes!

40:16.014 --> 40:18.815
This is it. This is it.
This is our moment. Gourlay!

40:18.852 --> 40:20.731
Take the kick!

40:20.851 --> 40:23.242
Gourlay's got this! Yeah!

40:30.253 --> 40:31.913
What are they doing?

40:31.961 --> 40:34.414
Good lord, Tom, they're
copying our barricade!

40:34.424 --> 40:36.077
We should have seen this coming.

40:36.111 --> 40:38.588
This is our last chance to take
the game. What are we going to do?

40:42.096 --> 40:43.584
John should take the kick.

40:43.639 --> 40:45.847
But he can't kick a straight
ball to save his life.

40:46.157 --> 40:47.513
Exactly.

40:47.883 --> 40:49.598
(chuckling)

40:49.670 --> 40:51.839
John Brackenreid! Take the kick!

40:51.877 --> 40:53.299
Huh?

40:55.685 --> 40:57.356
(some shouts)

40:58.087 --> 41:00.326
(some clapping)

41:04.297 --> 41:05.960
(whistle blow)

41:09.734 --> 41:11.170
(groan)

41:12.118 --> 41:14.306
(loud cheering and whistle blowing)

41:14.592 --> 41:16.556
We won! We won!

41:16.584 --> 41:19.090
We're going to the Olympic bloody Games!

41:19.456 --> 41:21.113
(chuckles) God!

41:23.445 --> 41:25.476
You'll deserve any medal
they win as if you were

41:25.515 --> 41:27.733
right there with them. McNabb!

41:28.995 --> 41:30.456
Thank you, Tom.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.158
Being here for this match
means the world to me.

41:33.193 --> 41:34.839
Just what old friends do.

41:38.865 --> 41:41.446
The lads will be needing
a firm hand in St. Louis.

41:42.652 --> 41:44.843
I wouldn't trust my team to anyone else.

41:45.181 --> 41:46.646
Good luck.

41:52.704 --> 41:54.480
Thomas C. Brackenreid,

41:54.600 --> 41:56.076
Olympian.

42:00.151 --> 42:01.761
I'll only be gone a couple weeks.

42:01.772 --> 42:03.288
Be sure to write us the results, sir.

42:03.310 --> 42:05.925
Write? I'll be telegraphing.
Sod the long distance.

42:06.182 --> 42:08.768
How often will I get to manage
a team at the Olympic games.

42:08.795 --> 42:10.707
Too right, sir. And if you
have a chance to pick up

42:10.738 --> 42:13.261
some of that fairy floss,
I'd be much obliged.

42:13.345 --> 42:15.094
I'll see what I can do, Crabtree.

42:15.430 --> 42:17.245
Now, Murdoch, the
payroll is in the safe,

42:17.427 --> 42:19.366
mark the ledger exactly as I do it.

42:19.388 --> 42:20.950
Also, the shed needs clearing out.

42:21.070 --> 42:23.026
I've left a long list
of duties on my desk.

42:23.044 --> 42:24.513
We'll try to manage, sir.

42:24.633 --> 42:27.899
Oh, and, uh, be sure to visit the
electrical pavilion at the fair.

42:27.926 --> 42:31.352
I understand they have a new
plug and wall socket installation.

42:31.388 --> 42:33.747
I'll be sure to make it my
first port of call, Murdoch.

42:33.782 --> 42:36.430
Right. And these are from Dr. Ogden:

42:36.463 --> 42:38.909
bandages and a liniment
of her own creation

42:38.927 --> 42:40.977
- for players' aches and pains.
- That's very kind of her!

42:41.001 --> 42:42.898
- Please, thank her for me.
- Ready, Father?

42:42.920 --> 42:43.996
We don't want to miss the train.

42:44.018 --> 42:45.793
They've decorated a special
car just for the team,

42:45.802 --> 42:47.480
with red and white
bunting, and streamers,

42:47.524 --> 42:49.512
and a sign telling everyone
the Galt Football Team

42:49.543 --> 42:51.877
- is going to the Olympic Games.
- Well, let's get going then!

42:51.912 --> 42:53.833
Ah! George Crabtree

42:53.904 --> 42:56.059
spies an open Rebecca James.

42:59.162 --> 43:00.820
(chuckles)

43:02.946 --> 43:05.105
Not bad, Miss James... for a lady.

43:05.119 --> 43:06.376

43:06.496 --> 43:08.602
maybe one day there'll be
a team of Canadian women

43:08.611 --> 43:09.793
vying for Olympic gold.

43:09.913 --> 43:12.446
(chuckling): That'll be the day.

43:12.710 --> 43:14.529
Come on John, let's go get a medal.

43:17.204 --> 43:19.205
(grand musical conclusion)
