01:01.041 --> 01:02.833
<i>Hey,</i> w<i>e're like a minute away.
Can you see me?</i>

01:03.041 --> 01:05.916
<i>Having trouble
with the picture. CC's a little buggy.</i>

01:06.083 --> 01:07.291
How about now?

01:07.458 --> 01:09.375
<i>Ah! There you are. Very chic.</i>

01:09.541 --> 01:11.458
Thank you. And our friend?

01:11.666 --> 01:13.750
<i>He's gonna be a tall bald guy
with a leather jacket.</i>

01:13.916 --> 01:15.541
<i>Meeting's just out.
They're coming your way.</i>

01:15.750 --> 01:17.125
<i>Fifty meters.</i>

01:20.708 --> 01:21.958
<i>Forty-five.</i>

01:25.958 --> 01:27.916
<i>- Thirty-five meters now.</i>
-  Uh-huh.

01:32.916 --> 01:34.958
 <i>Twenty meters.</i>

01:40.291 --> 01:41.833
<i>Ten meters.</i>

01:42.541 --> 01:43.958
OK, gotta go.

01:52.166 --> 01:53.750
-  Hi there.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.500
Hey, I got it.

03:06.291 --> 03:09.875
Mommy!

03:10.041 --> 03:12.000
Pistachio!

03:12.916 --> 03:15.208
Have you been eating bowling balls again?

03:15.375 --> 03:16.958
-  Yes.
-  Yes? How many?

03:17.125 --> 03:20.083
-  Ten.
-  Ten?

03:21.875 --> 03:23.708
-  Did you miss me?
-  Yeah.

03:23.875 --> 03:26.583
I missed you too.
Where have our men gone?

03:32.375 --> 03:35.041
-  Hello.
-  She's back!

03:35.208 --> 03:37.708
Yes, with a vengeance.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.333
Hi! Oh!

03:39.500 --> 03:41.291
Making my favorite pineapple chicken?

03:41.458 --> 03:42.666
That I am.

03:42.833 --> 03:44.458
Aww... Hi.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.000
- How was Nebraska?

03:46.166 --> 03:48.041
It was–Thank you–Meh.

03:48.208 --> 03:51.958
Four days of teaching mid level management
how to add vegan options

03:52.125 --> 03:54.000
to their franchise plans, which...

03:54.166 --> 03:57.541
I can guarantee is never gonna
happen in Plattsmouth, Nebraska.

03:59.041 --> 04:01.583
Then corporate made us go on
a six-hour team building

04:01.791 --> 04:04.041
glassworks tour on the final day.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.750
- You know, it was--
-  The usual?

04:06.916 --> 04:07.833
Yeah! The usual.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.875
Hey, where is Wy?
Trash bins are still out.

04:11.041 --> 04:12.875
Because they're too heavy.

04:13.041 --> 04:16.333
That cannot be, because this little one
ate all the bowling balls.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.208
Hello, my love. I missed you.

04:18.416 --> 04:21.250
OK. Those babies are going low and slow.

04:22.375 --> 04:23.250
Let's go.

04:23.458 --> 04:25.083
Honey, you uh...

04:27.083 --> 04:27.958
want to freshen up?

04:28.166 --> 04:29.500
- Hm?
-  Hey Mom, look.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.333
We're doing fancy restaurant.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.708
Fancy restaurant?

04:32.916 --> 04:35.083
- I'm going to be the bartender.
- And I'm going to be the waiter.

04:37.375 --> 04:40.416
And you made the pineapple chicken?

04:42.458 --> 04:44.458
Happy anniversary.

04:47.458 --> 04:48.458
Ah...

05:05.875 --> 05:08.625
<i>You forgot the anniversary. Sweet Jesus.</i>

05:08.833 --> 05:11.875
<i>You must be riddled with guilt.
How do you deal with it?</i>

05:12.083 --> 05:14.500
Well I'm currently busy making
the world's best pancakes.

05:15.208 --> 05:16.166
<i>Well, does it work?</i>

05:17.000 --> 05:18.333
Not even close.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.541
<i>So, Buenos Aires job:
client happy, money wired...</i>

05:21.708 --> 05:24.208
-  It's Raj again.
-  <i>...police in the wind as usual.</i>

05:24.416 --> 05:26.041
-  Uh-huh.
-  <i>Got some good news</i>

05:26.208 --> 05:27.541
<i>and some bad news.</i>

05:27.750 --> 05:31.041
<i>Bad news is your picture popped up again
on the dark net Most Wanted list.</i>

05:31.208 --> 05:33.833
<i>Good news is, I think
I scrubbed it out in time.</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:35.583
<i>But you've got to stay low.</i>

05:35.750 --> 05:37.375
Mm-hm. Yep, I got it.

05:37.541 --> 05:39.166
Hey, can we talk about this later?

05:39.333 --> 05:41.500
<i>Oh, Dave's there is he?
I won't keep you.</i>

05:41.708 --> 05:43.416
- <i>But there's another job.</i>
- Mm-hm.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.583
No, no, no. Not a chance.
Come on, I just got back.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.750
<i>Shame. It's a lot of money, this one.</i>

05:47.958 --> 05:49.750
<i>And they want the best,</i>

05:49.916 --> 05:51.666
<i>which just so happens to be you.</i>

05:51.833 --> 05:54.041
Yeah. Raj, I am aware of that.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.250
We talked about this,
no more trips till November.

05:56.416 --> 05:57.833
<i>Take a break. Fine.</i>

05:58.000 --> 06:00.208
<i>But Sovereign still has
a very healthy reward on your head</i>

06:00.416 --> 06:02.583
<i>for anyone who finds you.</i>

06:03.250 --> 06:06.708
<i>Now if you don't work,
I don't have the funds to keep you safe.</i>

06:06.875 --> 06:08.166
<i>And it isn't cheap.</i>

06:08.333 --> 06:11.000
Can I call you tomorrow? These pancakes
are getting burned over here.

06:11.166 --> 06:14.041
<i>Not surprised. Don't say
I didn't warn you about the heat.</i>

06:14.833 --> 06:16.666
Funny. Talk to you tomorrow.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.875
<i>Just be careful. I'm trying to--</i>

06:19.041 --> 06:21.375
- You OK?
- Yeah. Work.

06:21.583 --> 06:24.250
If it were up to them, they'd have me run
the entire Midwest at this point.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.000
You're too good at your job.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.041
So they tell me.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.000
- Who wants pancakes?
-  Me!

06:30.166 --> 06:31.000
All right.

06:31.208 --> 06:32.583
There you go.

06:33.750 --> 06:36.500
And... there you go, honey.

06:36.666 --> 06:38.083
There you go, baby.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.416
Hey, I didn't want the bunny one.
I want the boring one.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.666
There you go. Problem...

06:45.333 --> 06:46.291
Solved!

06:46.458 --> 06:47.916
- Good job.
- You're welcome.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.916
- I'll take that.
- Hey!

06:50.333 --> 06:51.708
-  Bye!
-  Bye!

06:51.916 --> 06:54.375
- I'll make you another one.
-  So as I said...

06:54.541 --> 06:56.166
Mr. Fluff and the Monkey Princess

06:56.375 --> 06:57.875
can't go together

06:58.041 --> 06:59.666
because they're not getting along.

06:59.833 --> 07:02.833
OK. Why is Mr. Fluff
and the Monkey Princess feuding?

07:03.041 --> 07:04.541
Because he's jealous.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.708
Jealous of who?
Johnny the Jackalope?

07:06.916 --> 07:09.083
Jealous of the Phantom Queen.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.333
The Phantom Queen. OK.

07:11.541 --> 07:14.083
All right honey, hold that thought, OK?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.625
I don't know man.
It's just something's off, you know?

07:24.916 --> 07:27.458
Trina just...
She feels like she's a million miles away.

07:28.333 --> 07:31.416
I mean, now she's at her sister's wedding
and not a single text.

07:31.916 --> 07:33.958
She's at her sister's wedding
and you're not there?

07:34.166 --> 07:35.166
Yeah. Why, is that bad?

07:35.375 --> 07:37.875
Well, it's not great, Kev.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.250
See,
this is why I need your perspective here.

07:41.458 --> 07:42.666
Because you know.

07:43.041 --> 07:46.083
I mean, you and Emma have been
married, what now? 20 years?

07:46.250 --> 07:47.125
Seven.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.750
You guys are like, well...

07:50.916 --> 07:52.083
couple goals.

07:53.916 --> 07:54.750
Yeah.

07:54.958 --> 07:58.166
No, no, no. It's still not OK.

07:58.375 --> 08:01.333
I knew you were coming off a long week.
I was coming off a long week.

08:01.541 --> 08:03.291
I figured we'd do something this weekend.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.375
Well, you made my favorite meal.
The kids did fancy restaurant.

08:06.583 --> 08:09.000
- I blew it.
- You had a long week.

08:09.208 --> 08:11.375
I forgot our anniversary.

08:11.541 --> 08:12.916
I'm the worst.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.083
What's that?

08:32.291 --> 08:33.791
- What?
- That.

08:35.416 --> 08:38.333
- Uh... This?
- Yes!

08:39.041 --> 08:41.291
This may be a... maybe a mistake.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.125
Dave! Did...

08:44.333 --> 08:46.583
Did you get me trashy lingerie?

08:48.041 --> 08:49.125
I mean, see what you think.

08:50.583 --> 08:53.375
You did and it's a costume!

08:54.666 --> 08:57.833
- Ha! Sexy nurse.
- Well, sexy nurse practitioner.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.958
- Oh right, no, of course.
- Bit much?

09:01.125 --> 09:03.000
No, no, not at all.

09:03.166 --> 09:05.125
I mean I just thought, you know,
it might be...

09:05.583 --> 09:08.083
fun to mix things up a bit.

09:12.666 --> 09:14.875
Is that what you want?
To mix things up a bit?

09:15.333 --> 09:16.750
Or do you want me to be someone else?

09:19.375 --> 09:20.416
For one night.

09:22.625 --> 09:23.958
Uh...

09:24.125 --> 09:25.375
I mean...

09:26.416 --> 09:27.708
Why not?

09:29.083 --> 09:30.625
I could change things up too.

09:30.833 --> 09:33.875
- This would be a two way street, so yeah.
- Sure, I could go Doctor.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.625
Stay on theme.

09:35.791 --> 09:38.083
- I need a stethoscope--
- Yes, but I...

09:39.083 --> 09:40.458
Let's do this for real.

09:41.791 --> 09:43.125
Tomorrow night in the city.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.708
Tomorrow night.
Short notice for a babysitter.

09:45.916 --> 09:47.708
Well, your sister still owes us
for Christmas.

09:47.916 --> 09:50.458
She does still owe us for Christmas.
OK so what are you thinking?

09:50.666 --> 09:51.958
See a show?

09:52.833 --> 09:55.208
No, we're not going to see a show, Dave.

09:56.666 --> 09:57.750
We're going to a hotel.

09:59.416 --> 10:01.375
- We're going to a hotel?
- A fancy hotel.

10:02.791 --> 10:05.833
We are going to meet by chance
in the hotel bar.

10:06.958 --> 10:08.458
I won't be me.

10:08.625 --> 10:09.666
You won't be you.

10:09.875 --> 10:13.000
Just two strangers meeting in a bar.

10:13.208 --> 10:16.250
Just two strangers meeting in a bar.

10:17.791 --> 10:20.458
<i>Mommy! I need a glass of water!</i>

10:20.625 --> 10:22.041
Tomorrow night.

10:23.458 --> 10:25.666
- Tomorrow night.
-  Tomorrow night.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.458
I'm gonna hold on to this.

10:29.083 --> 10:32.500
Come back here,
I'm gonna get what you stole!

10:32.666 --> 10:33.791
No, you're not.

10:33.958 --> 10:37.291
-  Guys, slow it down!

10:37.458 --> 10:39.083
Oh my God!

10:39.583 --> 10:42.708
I think it's great. I really do.
You guys deserve this.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.000
Yeah. Yeah it's just, you know...

10:45.208 --> 10:47.041
- We do, right?
-  Hell yes.

10:47.250 --> 10:51.333
You've both been working a lot.
The kids are awesome.

10:54.833 --> 10:56.458
You guys never leave the house

10:56.666 --> 10:59.083
and a backyard barbecue ain't gonna cut it
for an anniversary.

11:01.041 --> 11:02.250
OK.

11:02.416 --> 11:03.750
- Show me the shoes.
-  Yeah.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.916
Wait till you see the wig.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.250
Evening, miss.

12:04.583 --> 12:05.541
Excuse me.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.125
- Vodka martini, please.
-  Yes.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.291
Thanks.

12:16.708 --> 12:18.166
Come on!

12:30.833 --> 12:32.375
Really?

12:42.333 --> 12:43.208
Miss.

12:43.416 --> 12:45.416
Compliments of the gentleman.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.916
The kind of night I'm having
you wouldn't believe.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.291
Really?

13:08.916 --> 13:11.125
This is the kind of night
if I didn't find an empty seat

13:11.291 --> 13:13.166
next to a beautiful woman
at a well-stocked bar,

13:13.333 --> 13:17.041
I might start to question my luck in life.
But then, here I am.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.791
So how bad a night can it be?

13:20.416 --> 13:22.125
Bob Kitterman.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.541
- Alice Overby.
- Wonderful.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.583
Well...

13:31.583 --> 13:35.541
Alice Overby,
are you here alone? May I ask?

13:35.708 --> 13:37.041
It would appear to be, Bob.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.083
Well, well. Traveling?

13:40.291 --> 13:42.041
- It is a hotel, Bob.
- Fair enough.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.416
People end up in hotels for all
kinds of reasons, don't they?

13:44.625 --> 13:45.708
That is true.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.916
Forgive me.
I have to ask, are you a model?

13:48.125 --> 13:49.125
Ha!

13:49.291 --> 13:52.833
Your expression says I overshot.
But I assure you, it's not a line.

13:53.041 --> 13:56.125
You're very beautiful.
And you do look familiar.

13:56.291 --> 13:58.375
Well, thank you,
but I'm actually in finance.

13:58.583 --> 13:59.458
Ah!

13:59.625 --> 14:01.791
That's why I've felt
such a profound connection to you.

14:01.958 --> 14:05.416
Seeing you from over there, like I...
like I've known you for a long, long time.

14:05.625 --> 14:07.125
Are you in finance too, Bob?

14:07.291 --> 14:09.416
Don't worry, I'm not going
to tear your ear off about work.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.791
I have a strict policy
of keeping my daytimes out of my nights

14:13.416 --> 14:15.000
and vice versa.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.958
But let me ask you

14:18.458 --> 14:19.583
one question.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.500
OK Bob, one question.

14:23.041 --> 14:26.416
Do you love what you do?

14:32.958 --> 14:33.958
Some days.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.708
Some days, she says.
She kills me, this one.

14:39.875 --> 14:43.666
Alice Overby loves what she does
some days. I'll drink to that.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.375
All right well there it is,
mystery solved.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.666
But you really do look familiar.

14:53.875 --> 14:57.416
And I don't mean that
as some kind of line...

14:57.583 --> 14:59.291
some kind of ploy.

15:00.583 --> 15:02.375
I just have that kind of face, I guess.

15:03.208 --> 15:06.250
Some people do have that kind of face,
like an old girlfriend...

15:14.708 --> 15:17.000
-  What can I get you?
- I'll do an old fashioned.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.083
- Sure.
- Thanks.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.916
There are some young women

15:20.083 --> 15:22.291
that fall easily under the spell
of a much older man,

15:22.458 --> 15:24.958
but I suspect you
may not be one of them.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.291
Not the way you're making eyes
at this one down the bar.

15:28.208 --> 15:31.291
Look, as a little junior broker
on his night out,

15:31.708 --> 15:33.541
if I can be frank,
I think you can do better.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.666
Maybe I'm not in the market, Bob.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.166
Ah, I see.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.666
Just unwinding at the end
of a long day of business travel,

15:39.833 --> 15:41.250
wanting to be alone with your thoughts.

15:41.416 --> 15:43.208
- Trying.
-  Well, Alice.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.791
I'm going to give you that opportunity

15:44.958 --> 15:47.625
because I must remove myself for a moment.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.500
But, uh... Don't you go anywhere.

15:50.666 --> 15:52.625
Oh, no promises, Bob.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.291
Have we met?

16:30.416 --> 16:31.333
I don't think so.

16:31.750 --> 16:32.666
Oh.

16:33.333 --> 16:34.291
Well, I'm Jack.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.833
Jack. Alice Overby.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.208
Jack Dawson.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.458
Jack Dawson.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.791
Jack Dawson.

16:45.958 --> 16:48.500
Leo. <i>Titanic</i>. Really?

16:52.208 --> 16:54.250
How about, uh...
How about I buy you a drink?

16:55.208 --> 16:56.500
Yes, please.

16:56.666 --> 16:59.166
That is, unless your friend would mind.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.041
Oh, he's not my friend. We just met.

17:04.916 --> 17:06.416
What are you drinking, Alice?

17:06.583 --> 17:08.666
- Vodka martini.
-  All right.

17:09.208 --> 17:12.916
Excuse me. I'd like a vodka
martini for the lady

17:13.083 --> 17:15.791
and I'll bill that to the room,
if that's all right.

17:15.958 --> 17:18.041
Sure. I just need the name
and the room number.

17:18.208 --> 17:19.708
It's Jack...

17:20.291 --> 17:22.333
Dawson. And the room number is...

17:22.500 --> 17:24.958
Put that on mine, Chaz,
if that's all right with you, Jack.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.458
- Oh, no, it's fine.
-  Please.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.375
Just had some very nice news about work
and I'm in the mood to celebrate.

17:29.541 --> 17:32.125
Another scotch and soda for me.
Jack, another old fashioned?

17:32.291 --> 17:34.125
Uh, sure... Thanks.

17:34.291 --> 17:35.458
Jack, Bob. Bob, Jack.

17:35.625 --> 17:38.208
- Pleasure, Jack. Great suit.
- Oh, thank you.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.583
- Staying at the hotel?
- That's right.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.916
Um... In town for business.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.750
Well, the lady and I have made
a very firm agreement not to talk shop,

17:45.916 --> 17:48.875
so I'll ask what it is you do.
We'll leave it at that.

17:49.166 --> 17:52.625
Yes, please do tell us.
Please tell us. Jack, What do you do?

17:54.666 --> 17:56.166
I'm a photographer.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.583
Wow! Art or commerce?

17:58.750 --> 17:59.958
Journalism, mainly.

18:00.958 --> 18:03.625
I used to photograph combat zones,

18:03.791 --> 18:05.750
but now it's mainly wildlife.

18:05.916 --> 18:08.166
Exotic locales, that kind of thing.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.125
Wow! Wonderful, don't you think?

18:10.291 --> 18:11.375
Yeah, wonderful.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.416
I'm in finance myself, like the lady here.

18:13.583 --> 18:18.208
So for two sharks like us:
Wow, Jack, photography!

18:18.375 --> 18:19.625
Now,

18:19.791 --> 18:23.416
maybe those drinks won't quite suffice.
How about...

18:24.083 --> 18:24.916
a shot?

18:26.750 --> 18:29.500
- Oh, I don't think...
- I don't remember the last time I did one.

18:29.666 --> 18:32.291
Chaz, this rowdy crowd here
is fixing to add some shots.

18:32.458 --> 18:35.083
Some of that nice mezcal
you showed me last night.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.833
In the business we're in,
good news is so rare.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.541
I appreciate the company
for a celebratory round.

18:40.708 --> 18:43.416
Congrats Bob,
on whatever good news you've got.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.750
Well I don't mean to be coy, of course,

18:46.916 --> 18:51.083
but as it happens, a rather large contract
has all but fallen in my lap.

18:51.250 --> 18:54.041
So naturally, I'm over the moon.

18:54.208 --> 18:57.750
Sure, you'd be interested in the detail.

18:57.916 --> 19:00.375
I didn't get the particulars
of which part of the financial sector

19:00.541 --> 19:01.541
you're in, did I Alice?

19:01.708 --> 19:03.375
Mergers and acquisitions.

19:03.541 --> 19:07.375
Ah! So yes, I'm sure
we do have a lot in common after all.

19:07.541 --> 19:10.166
-  You're not based in New York?
- No, just here for meetings.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.541
I thought we might have
some European colleagues in common.

19:12.708 --> 19:13.625
Domestic only.

19:13.791 --> 19:15.666
- Aren't we done talking business, Bob?
- Right.

19:15.833 --> 19:19.208
Make a rule just to break it.
Naughty Bob! Ah, wonderful.

19:20.916 --> 19:22.166
<i>Salute.</i>

19:22.333 --> 19:23.333
-  Hm...
-  Hm...

19:23.500 --> 19:25.000
Yeah.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.833
Wow!

19:30.708 --> 19:32.875
I should have warned you.
Bit of a kick.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.791
Oh, yeah.
That's why I don't take shots.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.375
Excuse me, can I get a water please?
Thank you.

19:39.541 --> 19:41.958
This one is bright as a button, Jack.
You better believe it.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.166
Oh, I believe it.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.500
The kind of woman
a lot of men are looking for.

19:45.666 --> 19:47.166
A lot of men might kill for.

19:47.333 --> 19:50.000
Aren't we lucky to keep her company
even for a fleeting moment?

19:50.166 --> 19:51.875
In fact, I'll raise a glass to it.

19:53.166 --> 19:55.958
To... It is Alice, isn't it?

19:56.500 --> 19:57.958
As long as I can remember, Bob.

19:58.125 --> 19:59.541
To Alice Overby.

19:59.708 --> 20:03.875
And to all the less lucky victims
of her considerable charms.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.416
Another.

20:12.583 --> 20:13.958
We're good.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.375
Bob...

20:15.541 --> 20:17.541
- It's been a pleasure.
- Ah!

20:18.000 --> 20:21.250
I see. It would appear
I am cramping the young man's style.

20:21.416 --> 20:23.041
- Heaven forbid.
- I don't mean to be rude.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.208
No, of course not.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.291
If I were 20 years younger,
I might take offence...

20:26.458 --> 20:27.375
Bob!

20:27.541 --> 20:30.291
The hint is taken. So I will leave you.

20:30.458 --> 20:32.958
And Jack...
best of luck.

20:33.125 --> 20:34.250
And Alice, dear,

20:34.416 --> 20:36.750
dear, Alice.

20:36.916 --> 20:39.583
511 is the sweet number.
If anyone's itching for a nightcap,

20:39.750 --> 20:41.708
once they blink the lights.

20:42.125 --> 20:43.500
And on that note...

20:44.166 --> 20:45.166
Pow.

20:49.250 --> 20:51.375
I cannot believe we're finally alone.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.958
It is hard to believe, isn't it?

20:54.791 --> 20:57.708
So should we continue
getting to know each other, Jack?

20:58.583 --> 21:01.750
I would like that, Alice.
I would like that a lot.

21:02.125 --> 21:03.250
More shots?

21:07.166 --> 21:10.833
I'm actually here
scouting a location for a...

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
new solo show I have in the spring.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.041
- Solo? Cool.
- Yeah, sure.

21:17.208 --> 21:20.083
All the photographs I've taken in Beirut.

21:20.250 --> 21:22.500
And Turks and Caicos.

21:22.666 --> 21:24.875
- Turks and Caicos?
- Both of them.

21:25.041 --> 21:27.958
Is that your room, Mr. Dawson?

21:28.125 --> 21:29.708
- Yeah, yeah.
- OK.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.750
Here we are.
-  OK.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.833
- Here.
- Let's go, come on in.

21:36.791 --> 21:38.708
Join me in the room.

21:40.583 --> 21:43.416
Should I put on some music?

21:43.583 --> 21:45.333
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? OK.

21:51.458 --> 21:52.625
Oh, that's good.

21:55.125 --> 21:56.750
Here you go.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.041
Thank you. Cheers.

21:59.208 --> 22:00.791
- Cheers.
- Drink up.

22:04.166 --> 22:08.291
OK.
So why don't you also remove your shoes

22:08.458 --> 22:11.416
and meet me on the bed?
Get comfortable.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.083
I'll be right back.

22:13.416 --> 22:14.625
I'll do that.

22:16.625 --> 22:17.875
I'll do that.

24:20.291 --> 24:21.625
May I?

24:26.333 --> 24:27.750
Smart girl.

24:31.208 --> 24:34.083
How long have you been Alice Overby?

24:34.708 --> 24:36.333
Or was that just for tonight?

24:36.500 --> 24:38.041
Yeah. It's hard to keep track, Bob.

24:38.208 --> 24:39.541
You know the drill.

24:41.083 --> 24:42.708
- So who are you?
-  A kindred spirit.

24:42.875 --> 24:45.000
That simp down there, he a target?

24:45.666 --> 24:46.958
Being that we're kindred spirits,

24:47.125 --> 24:49.666
you can understand why I don't want
to elaborate on that topic.

24:49.833 --> 24:50.708
Fair enough.

24:50.875 --> 24:52.416
Me, I'm an open book.

24:52.583 --> 24:55.541
You see that Panamanian diplomat they
pulled out the East River this morning?

24:55.708 --> 24:56.958
I must have missed that one.

24:57.125 --> 24:58.791
More a headache
than it should have been.

24:58.958 --> 25:00.750
Ruined my favorite shirt.
You can believe it.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.375
So imagine my delight,

25:03.541 --> 25:05.500
when I see the woman across the bar

25:05.666 --> 25:07.416
is a familiar face.

25:07.583 --> 25:08.541
<i>Miss.</i>

25:08.708 --> 25:10.583
<i>Compliments of the gentleman.</i>

25:11.708 --> 25:15.250
<i>And the familiar face
has a very large bounty attached to it.</i>

25:15.416 --> 25:17.333
She kills me this one.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.125
<i>But I had to be sure.</i>

25:19.291 --> 25:21.750
Why, I stepped away
to take a more careful look

25:21.916 --> 25:24.125
at your photograph on the tip sheet.

25:24.291 --> 25:27.250
Sure enough, there it is.
The one and only

25:27.416 --> 25:28.791
Anna Peller.

25:30.916 --> 25:32.291
Oh, relax.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.750
Relax!

25:34.916 --> 25:36.625
Sovereign doesn't want you dead,

25:36.791 --> 25:40.291
which, come to think of it,
does set the mind reeling.

25:40.875 --> 25:44.166
A hired killer breaks with the world's
leading murder for hire syndicate

25:44.333 --> 25:45.458
and goes off grid.

25:45.625 --> 25:47.833
But I'm not even supposed to kill her.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.958
Gwen Carver
must have a real soft spot for you.

25:51.125 --> 25:52.708
Can we cut to the chase here, Bob?

25:52.875 --> 25:55.458
Well, perhaps us two birds of a feather

25:55.625 --> 25:57.166
could come up with an arrangement.

25:57.333 --> 25:58.875
Hm. And what does that look like?

25:59.041 --> 26:01.333
Sixty percent commission
on any future work.

26:01.500 --> 26:04.083
And you and me,
we keep a line open just between us.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.083
Hm...

26:06.666 --> 26:09.916
I could call our mutual friends
at Sovereign right now.

26:10.083 --> 26:12.541
Send one text
and bring the whole world down

26:12.708 --> 26:13.875
on your head.

26:14.708 --> 26:17.666
And do quite right by my bank account.

26:20.166 --> 26:21.875
So you don't work for Sovereign?

26:22.333 --> 26:24.583
I work for the highest bidder.
I always have.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.500
Twenty.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.500
Fifty.

26:33.666 --> 26:34.541
Twenty-five.

26:34.708 --> 26:38.125
Do not underestimate me
or what I'm capable of.

26:38.291 --> 26:41.750
Sovereign wants you alive, this is true.
But alive is a pretty broad term.

26:52.125 --> 26:53.958
- Nothing for you, Bob?

26:54.125 --> 26:57.750
A cyanide on the rocks?
I think I'll pass.

26:58.166 --> 26:59.666
OK. Suit yourself.

27:02.583 --> 27:03.458
There you go.

27:03.625 --> 27:04.791
So what do you think?

27:04.958 --> 27:07.458
You think we're getting closer to a deal?

27:07.625 --> 27:09.000
Forty.

27:09.916 --> 27:12.958
See, I don't think I have 40 percent
to give you.

27:13.125 --> 27:14.666
I already give 30 percent
to the guy

27:14.833 --> 27:17.375
who's supposed to keep guys
like you away from me. So...

27:17.750 --> 27:20.083
it's not in the budget.
You feel free to make that call.

27:21.958 --> 27:23.208
Although I don't think you will.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.875
And why,
is it out of the goodness of my heart?

27:26.041 --> 27:27.333
Oh, no, no, no.

27:27.833 --> 27:29.500
Because I already poisoned you
back at the bar.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.666
-  wha...

27:33.833 --> 27:35.958
You should know I don't leave home
without three things:

27:37.375 --> 27:38.708
My phone,

27:41.250 --> 27:42.541
my compact,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.208
and something a little more...

27:47.125 --> 27:48.000
lethal.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.500
Should have warned you.
Bit of a kick, that one. Are you OK?

27:50.666 --> 27:53.000
Oh, yeah. That's why I don't take shots.

27:53.166 --> 27:54.916
Excuse me, can I have a water, please?

27:55.083 --> 27:56.916
To Alice Overby.

27:57.083 --> 27:59.166
And to all the less lucky victims

27:59.333 --> 28:01.500
of her considerable charms.

28:08.791 --> 28:10.291
You should really start
to feel that,

28:10.458 --> 28:12.416
right about...

28:13.041 --> 28:14.000
- Now.

28:16.708 --> 28:18.416
Oh, Bob.

28:18.583 --> 28:21.208
My friend. Shots are never a good idea.

28:21.375 --> 28:23.041
No. You took your eyes off your scotch.

28:24.083 --> 28:27.208
I just came up here to make sure
you hadn't called our friends at Sovereign

28:27.375 --> 28:29.416
before you lost your speech.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.166
And your sight.

28:32.583 --> 28:34.041
And the rest.

28:39.291 --> 28:42.041
Bob, Bob, Bob.

28:42.208 --> 28:43.875
Sorry man. Wrong place, wrong time.

28:44.041 --> 28:46.708
I have a family to protect.
I'm sure you understand.

28:46.875 --> 28:47.958
- Shit.

28:51.041 --> 28:52.208
Hey, babe. Hi.

28:52.375 --> 28:53.875
Hey, where are you?

28:54.041 --> 28:56.458
Did you get my note? I just ran out
to get aspirin. I'll be right back.

28:56.625 --> 28:57.708
<i>I woke up and you were gone.</i>

28:57.875 --> 28:59.833
Oh no, I'm sorry.
Just going to be a quick thing.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.375
-  <i>Can you grab me some too?</i>
- Yeah. No problem.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.041
- OK. I'll see you soon.

29:31.666 --> 29:32.708
Great.

29:43.375 --> 29:44.666
Hey.

29:45.791 --> 29:47.958
I can't believe I fell asleep.

29:48.125 --> 29:49.416
Oh...

29:49.583 --> 29:51.000
Oh, no, it's OK.

29:51.708 --> 29:52.750
I'm sorry.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.375
Don't be sorry.

29:55.541 --> 29:58.000
-  I'm awake now.

29:59.750 --> 30:00.958
How's your head?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.166
It's better now.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.375
Our first dance.

30:37.541 --> 30:39.708
- Must be a sign.
- Yeah...

30:40.291 --> 30:41.458
Must be.

30:57.875 --> 31:01.000
All right, lovebirds.
Enjoy those hangovers.

31:01.166 --> 31:03.500
-  Thank you. We love you.
-  Love you.

31:05.500 --> 31:08.125
Molly said Coco missed us

31:08.291 --> 31:09.916
and wanted to see us.

31:10.083 --> 31:13.458
I think that's because
he doesn't have enough dog friends.

31:13.625 --> 31:15.333
So if we get a dog,

31:15.500 --> 31:17.916
Coco wouldn't be lonely anymore.

31:18.083 --> 31:21.291
And our dog could play with Coco
all the time.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.833
Mom is allergic baby.
We've talked about this.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.041
Yeah, no dogs.

31:25.208 --> 31:27.000
But they do have dogs
with no fur, you know?

31:27.166 --> 31:28.500
- We could get one of those.
-  No dogs

31:28.666 --> 31:30.958
and no screens at the table, remember?

31:31.125 --> 31:33.458
Well,
how does Mom get to be on the phone?

31:34.166 --> 31:35.458
Naughty mommy.

31:37.416 --> 31:38.416
Hey.

31:38.916 --> 31:41.250
- Are you OK?
- Oh yeah. Sorry.

31:41.416 --> 31:42.958
It's Raj. He's just freaking out.

31:43.125 --> 31:45.833
They're thinking of scrapping
the entire strategy for the East Coast.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.500
- I don't know.

31:47.666 --> 31:49.625
And now he's calling me. Babe, I'm sorry.

31:49.791 --> 31:51.291
I'm sorry.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.000
Hey.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.875
<i>You don't text me,
you don't call. I do.</i>

31:59.041 --> 32:00.125
<i>That's what we agreed.</i>

32:00.291 --> 32:02.541
Raj, I'm exposed.

32:03.541 --> 32:04.916
<i>What happened?</i>

32:05.083 --> 32:06.583
Did you see what I sent you?

32:08.291 --> 32:09.916
<i>Oh God, what a mess.</i>

32:10.083 --> 32:11.791
<i>I told you to stay low.</i>

32:11.958 --> 32:13.541
Someone found me.
I had to take care of it.

32:14.250 --> 32:15.791
<i>This is all over the news.</i>

32:15.958 --> 32:18.875
- <i>You're 100 percent on Carver's radar now.</i>
- I'm coming to you.

32:19.125 --> 32:20.500
- Tomorrow.
-  <i>No, don't.</i>

32:20.666 --> 32:23.541
<i>If Sovereign's got your scent,
the last place to be is the airport.</i>

32:27.791 --> 32:29.291
Hey, what's up?

32:29.458 --> 32:31.291
<i>Bro, the Royal Grand, right?</i>

32:31.958 --> 32:33.041
What?

32:33.500 --> 32:36.583
<i>The hotel you were staying at.
It was the Royal Grand?</i>

32:37.291 --> 32:38.666
Yeah. Why?

32:39.250 --> 32:41.541
<i>Texting you a link right now.</i>

32:49.500 --> 32:52.875
<i>Dude, you guys know how to pick a hotel.</i>

33:02.291 --> 33:03.875
Emma!

33:04.041 --> 33:06.208
Police sources say
that the murder took place

33:06.375 --> 33:09.166
somewhere between midnight
and 3 a.m. last night.

33:09.333 --> 33:10.791
Hotel staff discovered the body

33:10.958 --> 33:13.916
when Mr. Kitterman
failed to check out this morning.

33:14.083 --> 33:16.541
No suspects have yet been named
in the investigation.

33:16.708 --> 33:20.083
The police are seeking to identify
a man and woman

33:20.250 --> 33:24.000
seen talking with the victim
at the hotel bar

33:24.166 --> 33:25.833
earlier on the night in question.

33:26.000 --> 33:26.833
That's us.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.958
-  T-t-that's us!
- Mm-hm.

33:29.125 --> 33:31.250
Police stressed it is early
in the investigation,

33:31.416 --> 33:33.875
but did confirm that the couple
from the bar

33:34.041 --> 33:37.166
are currently considered
persons of interest in the case.

33:37.333 --> 33:38.583
That is one hundred percent us.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.333
We are the man and woman
from the hotel bar.

33:41.500 --> 33:42.916
We are the persons of interest.

33:43.083 --> 33:44.916
Sure there are no pictures on there?

33:46.375 --> 33:48.083
- No, none.
- OK.

33:48.250 --> 33:50.458
Um... We have to call. Right?

33:51.083 --> 33:53.333
Is-is there even a number?
How would we call them?

33:53.500 --> 33:55.250
There is. There is. Should I call?

33:55.750 --> 33:57.583
- What do we tell them?
- What do we tell them about what?

33:57.750 --> 33:59.333
Why we're not who we say we are?

34:00.958 --> 34:03.708
Right... The fake names!

34:03.875 --> 34:06.458
- I was wearing a fucking wig, Dave.
-  Oh, shit!

34:07.291 --> 34:08.458
OK, OK...

34:09.833 --> 34:12.250
We may not have been the only ones
he talked to at the bar.

34:12.416 --> 34:13.791
We did shots with him, Dave.

34:14.541 --> 34:15.625
We did shots...

34:16.125 --> 34:18.083
Damn it! Why did we do shots?

34:19.041 --> 34:21.125
OK, we wait.

34:22.416 --> 34:24.916
We wait.
OK. It's not like we know anything.

34:25.083 --> 34:27.625
Right? We'll see. We'll see...

34:28.333 --> 34:30.166
Maybe... maybe someone comes forward.

34:30.333 --> 34:33.541
Maybe they catch the person who did it.

34:33.708 --> 34:34.541
We wait and see.

34:34.708 --> 34:36.625
Yes, we wait and see. Good.

34:36.791 --> 34:38.375
They don't even know who we are.

34:38.541 --> 34:41.375
- Kitterman picked up the tab, so...
-  Right. Right.

34:41.541 --> 34:42.916
- We wait.
- Yeah.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.916
Looks kinda... yeah.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.291
- Is that crazy?
- Um...

34:47.458 --> 34:51.666
It just doesn't look good.
I mean, the names, the wig, the shots...

34:52.333 --> 34:53.583
No, it doesn't look good.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.083
Uh huh.

34:56.250 --> 34:57.916
-  Oh my God.
- Hey, hey, hey.

34:58.916 --> 35:00.208
- It's going to be OK.
- Yeah. No.

35:00.375 --> 35:03.208
Everything is happening all at once,
and it's all coming down at the same time.

35:03.375 --> 35:05.083
And I just. That call I just had with Raj

35:05.250 --> 35:06.750
and now they need me in Boise tomorrow

35:06.916 --> 35:08.166
instead of next month.

35:08.333 --> 35:10.291
So I figured out
this flight for the morning, and I...

35:11.208 --> 35:12.708
- But you just got back!
- I know, I know.

35:12.875 --> 35:14.041
It's just for one meeting.

35:14.458 --> 35:17.083
I'll be back Monday, and maybe
if they haven't figured this out by then,

35:17.250 --> 35:18.416
we'll call. We'll call then.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.750
OK, yeah. That's good. Yeah...

35:20.916 --> 35:23.250
Yeah, all right. We'll call then.

35:23.958 --> 35:26.291
Boise?
Can't you do a Zoom?

35:26.458 --> 35:27.416
No.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.458
It has to be in person, sorry.
It has to be quick.

35:29.625 --> 35:31.958
OK. OK. We're gonna be OK.

35:32.125 --> 35:34.708
-  We're gonna be OK.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.083
-  Car's here.
-  OK.

36:16.458 --> 36:18.625
Hey. Go easy on your old man, OK?

36:18.791 --> 36:20.833
- Sure, Mom.
- I'm going to miss you.

36:25.375 --> 36:26.958
Baby girl. Hi.

36:28.250 --> 36:30.125
When are you coming home?

36:30.291 --> 36:32.208
You won't even notice I'm gone.

36:32.375 --> 36:34.583
I already notice that you're gone.

36:36.750 --> 36:37.916
OK.

36:38.583 --> 36:41.041
- I love you.
-  I love you too.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.000
I know, God. OK, baby.

36:43.166 --> 36:44.916
I gotta go. I gotta go.

36:50.958 --> 36:55.333
OK, um... Hey, don't forget
Wyatt starts his second vitamins tomorrow

36:55.500 --> 36:57.583
and Car's new pick up time is...

36:57.750 --> 36:59.291
At four, not five.

37:00.208 --> 37:02.083
- I love you.
- Love you too.

37:03.958 --> 37:06.291
-  I'll call when I can.
- Fly safe.

37:08.291 --> 37:11.083
OK. I'm gonna come get you at the airport.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.041
Yeah.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.541
All right.

37:15.708 --> 37:16.791
OK.

37:19.541 --> 37:20.583
Love you.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.041
Love you.

37:30.333 --> 37:31.791
Which terminal?

37:33.125 --> 37:34.291
International.

37:50.583 --> 37:54.333
<i>That ten percent uptake
in Portland in Austin by November.</i>

37:54.500 --> 37:58.375
<i>But if we manage to land the equal
market demo space at South By,</i>

37:58.541 --> 38:00.458
<i>that could be a game changer...</i>

38:01.791 --> 38:04.500
Now. I'll throw it over to Dave. Dave!

38:06.583 --> 38:12.125
Yes, it's very exciting.
As Kevin was saying...

38:28.250 --> 38:30.333
<i>Hey it's Emma. Leave a message.</i>

38:44.750 --> 38:47.666
<i>She says she's missing
the pink water bottle from the backpack.</i>

38:47.833 --> 38:50.708
Molly, I'm sure she'll survive.

38:50.875 --> 38:53.708
I can't talk pink water bottles right now.
I'm at the airport.

38:53.875 --> 38:56.125
<i>I'm just telling you what she told me.</i>

38:56.291 --> 38:59.625
- I'll call you as soon as I get Emma. OK?
-  <i>All right.</i>

39:14.875 --> 39:16.958
<i>Hey it's Emma. Leave a message.</i>

39:24.208 --> 39:26.916
I need you to check again.
It's Emma. Emma Brackett.

39:27.083 --> 39:30.291
It's the flight from Boise.
The 702 from Boise.

39:33.666 --> 39:35.875
<i>Hey it's Emma. Leave a message.</i>

39:36.041 --> 39:38.083
I do have an Emmy Wu.
Is she Emmy Wu?

39:38.250 --> 39:39.750
No, she's not.

39:40.125 --> 39:42.208
<i>Hey it's Emma. Leave a message.</i>

39:44.125 --> 39:46.416
Maybe it's the spelling. Try Emma

39:46.583 --> 39:47.708
B, R, A--

39:47.875 --> 39:49.250
Sir, I already searched.

39:49.416 --> 39:52.208
and there's nothing else I can do.

39:52.375 --> 39:53.458
...T.

40:15.916 --> 40:17.875
Dave Brackett?

40:18.041 --> 40:21.208
Detective Tobi Berman,
NYPD Homicide.

40:21.375 --> 40:23.041
That's my partner.
Detective Karen Shah.

40:23.208 --> 40:25.083
You got a few minutes?

40:28.166 --> 40:32.125
I know, I know. We were going to call
when she got back.

40:32.291 --> 40:33.583
And your wife ain't back.

40:33.750 --> 40:36.958
Yes. So you should be calling the police
in Boise, right?

40:37.125 --> 40:40.125
Yeah, you can bet we're gonna get on that,
Dave. Right after we're done here.

40:40.291 --> 40:41.666
Look, am I being accused of something?

40:41.833 --> 40:44.166
Do you feel like you're being accused
of something?

40:44.333 --> 40:47.125
Well, I feel like...
I feel like maybe I should...

40:47.291 --> 40:48.750
I feel like maybe
I should have a lawyer.

40:48.916 --> 40:51.000
Do you have a lawyer, Dave?

40:51.833 --> 40:54.500
I have a guy who drew up paperwork
for us for the house.

40:54.666 --> 40:56.166
Why do you want to call the guy?

40:56.833 --> 40:58.500
Did the paperwork for the house

40:58.666 --> 41:00.375
like your real estate agent?

41:00.541 --> 41:01.916
Or we can call someone for you.

41:02.083 --> 41:03.916
Look, I'm not trying to be difficult.

41:04.083 --> 41:05.666
I don't think you're being difficult.

41:05.833 --> 41:07.708
I think maybe you're nervous.

41:07.875 --> 41:09.375
No, I'm not. I'm not nervous.

41:09.541 --> 41:11.083
It's normal to be nervous.

41:11.250 --> 41:13.083
We're just looking for information.

41:13.250 --> 41:14.500
Sure.

41:14.666 --> 41:16.500
Now do you want to wait for that lawyer?

41:16.666 --> 41:19.208
Or do you want to keep talking
about that night at the Royal Grand?

41:19.375 --> 41:22.583
OK. OK. Yeah.
So it was our anniversary Thursday.

41:22.750 --> 41:24.916
How did you and your wife
know Mr. Kitterman?

41:25.416 --> 41:27.958
We didn't. We didn't!

41:28.125 --> 41:30.083
I was late to meet her

41:30.500 --> 41:31.541
at the bar.

41:31.708 --> 41:34.625
I guess he had started chatting her up.

41:34.791 --> 41:38.583
And when I...
Look, I think he'd had a few.

41:38.750 --> 41:42.333
And were you using an assumed name
that night at the hotel, Mr. Brackett?

41:44.208 --> 41:45.625
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What?

41:45.791 --> 41:48.625
You were using an assumed name
that night at the hotel.

41:50.375 --> 41:51.333
Um...

41:52.875 --> 41:54.333
I...

41:54.500 --> 41:57.958
OK, look. This looks pretty bad. I know.

41:58.125 --> 42:00.291
Um...
Honestly, it's just a little embarrassing.

42:01.375 --> 42:03.500
See, my wife and I, we were...

42:03.666 --> 42:08.333
We were playing a game,
you know, like a kind of like a...

42:09.541 --> 42:11.125
Like a role play.

42:11.291 --> 42:14.708
Just like a game, you know, or whatnot.

42:14.875 --> 42:18.250
And in the interest of excitement
and whatnot, we...

42:20.250 --> 42:21.333
we use different names.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.000
And um...

42:23.916 --> 42:28.208
It was just to spice things up
a little bit, you know? You know.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.250
Do you and your wife

42:34.416 --> 42:36.333
role play often, Mr. Brackett?

42:36.500 --> 42:38.708
No! No.

42:38.875 --> 42:40.666
It was the first time.

42:45.041 --> 42:48.333
Mr. Brackett,
this is Special Agent Carver with ITIC.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.041
She'll be joining us,
if you don't mind.

42:50.208 --> 42:53.583
She's part of a task force
helping in this investigation.

42:53.750 --> 42:56.916
Nice to meet you, Mr. Brackett.
Please continue.

42:59.458 --> 43:02.375
Mr. Brackett, how long have you
and your wife been married?

43:02.958 --> 43:04.916
Seven years as of Thursday.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.458
- And you have two children?
- Yes.

43:07.625 --> 43:09.291
Wyatt is ten. Caroline, six.

43:09.458 --> 43:11.708
Wyatt's my son from a previous marriage.

43:11.875 --> 43:13.833
Emma has been his mom
for a long time now.

43:16.083 --> 43:17.666
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but...

43:17.833 --> 43:20.833
What is it? What exactly is this about?

43:32.666 --> 43:34.625
Is this woman your wife,
Mr. Brackett?

43:35.625 --> 43:36.791
No.

43:36.958 --> 43:38.916
Her name is Emma Rayburn.

43:39.750 --> 43:42.666
That's Emma's name. Maiden name.

43:42.833 --> 43:45.541
No. This woman is Emma Jay Rayburn.

43:46.083 --> 43:48.958
Thirty-three years old.
Five foot seven, hazel eyes.

43:49.125 --> 43:52.916
Social security number: 174631503.

43:53.083 --> 43:54.291
What are you telling me?

43:56.333 --> 43:59.291
Mr. Brackett, Emma Rayburn died
eight years ago.

43:59.875 --> 44:02.875
You met your wife about eight years ago.
Is that right?

44:11.666 --> 44:12.916
-  Dave?
- Huh?

44:13.083 --> 44:16.375
I'm going to show you some photographs
of my own, if that's all right.

44:19.250 --> 44:20.791
This is from Buenos Aires Airport,

44:20.958 --> 44:23.500
Argentina, last Wednesday.

44:24.583 --> 44:29.000
Four hours before this picture was taken,
a local union leader was found murdered.

44:29.916 --> 44:32.916
A woman matching this description
was seen leaving the crime scene.

44:33.083 --> 44:35.083
Yeah, but she was in Nebraska.

44:35.833 --> 44:36.750
So...

44:38.250 --> 44:40.958
The man at the hotel, Robert Kitterman,

44:41.125 --> 44:44.125
we believe that's an alias used
by this man, Derrick Worley,

44:44.708 --> 44:48.791
a contract killer responsible
for more than 30 murders internationally.

44:52.333 --> 44:53.791
This is Rajendra Bakshi.

44:56.791 --> 44:58.958
That's my wife's supervisor. Raj.

44:59.541 --> 45:02.083
He's a black marketeer
working the dark web.

45:02.250 --> 45:06.166
Born in Chennai, raised in the UK,
operating out of Berlin.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.708
He serves as her handler.

45:12.125 --> 45:13.416
Her handler?

45:13.583 --> 45:15.583
This is not gonna be easy,
Mr. Brackett,

45:17.166 --> 45:18.291
but...

45:19.208 --> 45:20.708
your wife's real name

45:20.875 --> 45:22.458
is Anna Peller.

45:23.500 --> 45:25.708
Wanted for contract killings across
several continents.

45:26.750 --> 45:28.791
We need you to help us find her.

45:31.375 --> 45:33.083
I'm sorry.

45:34.666 --> 45:36.500
I'm sorry.

45:43.083 --> 45:44.791
What the...

45:48.416 --> 45:49.833
What?

47:16.541 --> 47:17.666
What...

47:37.916 --> 47:39.000
Oh...

47:39.750 --> 47:41.125
Agent Carver.

47:41.291 --> 47:43.916
Mr. Bracket. Glad we caught you at home.

47:44.083 --> 47:48.333
This is my associate at the agency.
Agent Ji.

47:48.583 --> 47:49.583
Hi. Hey...

47:50.458 --> 47:51.541
I'm Dave.

47:52.166 --> 47:54.458
Would it be possible
to have a moment of your time?

47:55.416 --> 47:57.958
Oh... What is it I can help you with?

48:00.958 --> 48:02.708
Well, um...

48:03.208 --> 48:05.416
This might be a bit awkward out here.

48:10.041 --> 48:11.500
There she is.

48:13.791 --> 48:15.375
You have a lovely family.

48:15.916 --> 48:17.083
Thank you.

48:17.583 --> 48:20.458
Wyatt, and um...

48:21.375 --> 48:22.583
Caroline.

48:22.750 --> 48:23.791
Mm-hm.

48:23.958 --> 48:25.708
Mind if we keep this?

48:26.041 --> 48:27.166
We'll get it back to you.

48:34.750 --> 48:35.958
<i>Danke.</i>

48:37.875 --> 48:39.458
Taxi! Taxi!

48:56.666 --> 48:57.916
You look terrible.

48:58.083 --> 48:59.916
Yeah, it was a very long flight.

49:00.083 --> 49:01.708
Three flights in fact.

49:01.875 --> 49:03.166
You shouldn't have come here.

49:03.333 --> 49:04.916
- It's not safe.
-  Oh, OK.

49:05.083 --> 49:06.833
Then drive the damn car.

49:11.375 --> 49:12.916
What can I do for you,
Agent Carver?

49:13.083 --> 49:16.000
It's really more
about what we can do for you.

49:18.291 --> 49:19.333
How's that?

49:19.500 --> 49:21.333
You must have concerns

49:21.500 --> 49:23.333
for the safety of your family.

49:23.500 --> 49:24.916
And I think

49:25.416 --> 49:27.583
your feelings about your wife

49:27.750 --> 49:30.041
must be complicated right now,

49:30.708 --> 49:32.208
to say the least.

49:32.375 --> 49:34.791
But I want you to know
that I will do anything in my power

49:34.958 --> 49:36.041
to bring her back.

49:37.416 --> 49:38.291
Thanks.

49:38.458 --> 49:40.791
Look, I fucked up in New York.
I get that, we make mistakes.

49:40.958 --> 49:43.291
It happens to the best of us.
But why was there heat on me at first?

49:43.458 --> 49:45.416
Actually, no.
It doesn't happen to the best of us.

49:45.583 --> 49:48.500
I can't protect you if you're out there
murdering sovereign reps.

49:48.666 --> 49:50.583
He wasn't Sovereign.
He just had them on speed dial.

49:50.750 --> 49:52.041
Why was there heat on me?

49:52.208 --> 49:55.666
There's always heat. Don't you get it?
She's never gonna to let you go.

49:56.541 --> 49:58.083
Emma is a threat.

49:58.791 --> 50:00.041
A dangerous one.

50:00.625 --> 50:02.625
Maybe most dangerous to herself.

50:04.458 --> 50:05.500
Dave,

50:06.500 --> 50:09.041
I understand your loyalty to your wife,

50:09.916 --> 50:11.583
but it is crucial

50:12.083 --> 50:13.208
right now

50:13.375 --> 50:16.791
that I search your house for evidence
to help us locate her.

50:19.458 --> 50:22.583
Sorry to ask, but um...

50:23.500 --> 50:25.375
don't you need...

50:26.166 --> 50:28.541
don't you need a warrant for that?

50:33.041 --> 50:35.541
Oh, you sure you don't want
to hand me in and take the reward?

50:35.708 --> 50:36.708
Very funny.

50:36.875 --> 50:39.416
If I wanted to hand you over,
I could have done it a long time ago.

50:39.583 --> 50:41.000
Oh yeah?

50:41.166 --> 50:43.166
Do you have any idea what I do for you?

50:43.833 --> 50:45.375
What you do for me?

50:45.541 --> 50:47.000
Last I checked,

50:47.166 --> 50:49.125
I do the dirty work, and you get paid.

50:49.291 --> 50:51.166
I keep you underground.

50:51.333 --> 50:52.666
Yeah well...

50:52.833 --> 50:55.416
that's not exactly going as planned.

50:56.750 --> 50:59.791
Your wife, Emma, is a role
played by a criminal

50:59.958 --> 51:01.750
named Anna Peller.

51:02.458 --> 51:04.041
She played you.

51:05.833 --> 51:07.375
Don't let her play you anymore.

51:07.541 --> 51:10.041
You've been on the tip sheet
since the sighting in Tel Aviv.

51:10.208 --> 51:11.291
You know that.

51:11.458 --> 51:14.500
The last thing you should be doing
is trolling luxury hotels in Manhattan.

51:16.416 --> 51:19.041
I forgot our fucking anniversary.

51:19.208 --> 51:23.333
She is incapable of love or compassion.

51:24.750 --> 51:27.708
She is a cold-blooded killer

51:28.958 --> 51:31.625
who lied to you
and endangered your children.

51:32.375 --> 51:33.791
It's not just New York.

51:33.958 --> 51:35.708
Your head isn't in the game
and I know that before.

51:35.875 --> 51:38.333
Yeah, well, I told you I need out.
Do you have them?

51:43.875 --> 51:45.625
Kids too?

51:47.250 --> 51:48.916
Good. Good.

51:50.333 --> 51:51.375
Dave,

51:51.541 --> 51:53.166
I'm going to ask you one more time.

51:54.083 --> 51:56.333
Might I take a look around?

51:59.000 --> 52:01.041
I've done what I can
to protect your little fantasy

52:01.208 --> 52:02.708
but it's time to wake up, Emma.

52:03.250 --> 52:04.291
Um...

52:05.541 --> 52:07.875
Time to say goodbye
to your perfect little family.

52:08.041 --> 52:10.958
I told you, I'm getting them out
and then I'm done with all this shit.

52:11.125 --> 52:14.625
She is a cold-blooded murderer.

52:15.375 --> 52:16.500
Until the money runs out

52:17.500 --> 52:18.583
or they pick up your scent.

52:18.750 --> 52:20.541
And I'm not there to help you.

52:30.083 --> 52:33.375
Black G-wagon about three cars back.
It's Sovereign.

52:37.041 --> 52:39.958
Pull up over here. Just pull over!

52:52.833 --> 52:54.958
Um... Mr. Brackett,

52:55.125 --> 52:57.541
I'm very sorry. We're going
to have to continue this discussion

52:57.708 --> 52:59.083
at a later date.

52:59.250 --> 53:00.583
We will be in touch.

53:00.750 --> 53:02.791
And thank you very much for your time.

53:03.583 --> 53:05.083
Yeah, sure.

53:19.958 --> 53:22.208
You can't run away from her forever, Anna.

53:22.375 --> 53:23.500
Bye.

53:53.041 --> 53:54.166
Watch the back.

53:54.333 --> 53:56.083
I got the back.

54:24.375 --> 54:25.250
Do you see her?

54:25.416 --> 54:26.375
Negative.

54:43.625 --> 54:44.791
Whoa!

56:19.208 --> 56:20.708
Sleep tight.

56:31.041 --> 56:32.833
Emma! Here!

56:35.791 --> 56:37.208
-  Get in!

56:39.458 --> 56:41.000
-  <i>Scheisse!</i>

56:45.875 --> 56:47.291
Now. Go!

56:54.250 --> 56:56.000
Hey, you OK?

56:56.166 --> 56:58.291
Whoa, Raj, are you OK?

56:58.458 --> 56:59.541
Shit, shit!

57:01.750 --> 57:02.708
Go.

57:06.083 --> 57:08.083
Get your foot off the gas!

57:13.791 --> 57:14.750
Oh shit, shit!

57:16.291 --> 57:18.000
Shit, shit, shit!

57:23.083 --> 57:23.916
Raj!

57:34.458 --> 57:36.041
Oh my God.

57:44.625 --> 57:46.458
Shit!

57:47.041 --> 57:48.416
Shit!

58:02.666 --> 58:04.916
<i>We're sorry.</i>

58:05.083 --> 58:08.458
<i>Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Please check the number and--</i>

58:19.458 --> 58:23.541
<i>Lo sientimos. El numero marcado no existe.</i>

58:34.666 --> 58:36.791
Oh my God.

59:17.166 --> 59:18.375
Emma?

59:21.958 --> 59:22.958
<i>Em?</i>

59:30.708 --> 59:32.166
<i>Are you alone?</i>

59:33.500 --> 59:34.916
Yeah, I'm alone.

59:36.041 --> 59:37.583
<i>How'd you get this number?</i>

59:38.083 --> 59:39.416
How did I get this number?

59:40.291 --> 59:41.666
- Dave...
-  <i>I got this number</i>

59:41.833 --> 59:43.333
on the business card of a German plumber,

59:43.500 --> 59:45.250
which was in a box
of my wife's murder things

59:45.416 --> 59:46.708
<i>in the attic!</i>

59:46.875 --> 59:49.791
- <i>Who the fuck are you?</i>
- OK. Are you in the house?

59:50.458 --> 59:51.708
-  Yes.
- Kids?

59:51.875 --> 59:53.833
<i>At school. Molly's picking them up.</i>

59:54.000 --> 59:55.333
Dave, walk outside.

59:56.458 --> 59:58.291
What? Walk outside?

59:58.458 --> 59:59.291
Why?

59:59.458 --> 01:00:01.291
Dave, get out of the house now.

01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:12.708
I'm away from the house.

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.250
Dave, I'm so sorry.

01:00:16.416 --> 01:00:17.708
Sorry.

01:00:18.833 --> 01:00:20.666
Sorry for what?

01:00:20.833 --> 01:00:24.333
For leaving us?
For lying to us? To me?

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.958
<i>I don't even know who you are.</i>

01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:28.208
Yes, you do. I am Emma. I am your wife.

01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:29.875
But you're not.

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:31.750
They told me what you are.

01:00:31.916 --> 01:00:34.041
I had to sit there in that room,

01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:37.166
not knowing whether you were alive
or dead.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:41.375
<i>Listening to this woman tell me
that my wife, my wife,</i>

01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:45.208
my everything is not who she claims to be.

01:00:47.125 --> 01:00:49.250
My wife is a killer.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.375
An a-assassin.

01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:56.208
Emma, is it true?

01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:05.958
Em?

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.000
Oh, geez.

01:01:11.416 --> 01:01:12.791
OK, listen to me. Yes, I lied.

01:01:12.958 --> 01:01:14.916
I lied about what I do,
but I never lied about us.

01:01:15.083 --> 01:01:17.625
- We have children!
-  <i>I know, I know. I know.</i>

01:01:24.166 --> 01:01:25.958
The funny thing, Em,

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:28.500
about when they told me.

01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:33.333
A part of me was relieved.
Relieved that finally I knew,

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.125
I knew what it was,
what you were keeping from me.

01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:38.125
<i>That you hadn't fell out love with me.</i>

01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:40.791
Dave, I never fell out of love with you.

01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:44.375
And I never fell out of love with you.
I don't think I could if I wanted to.

01:01:44.541 --> 01:01:47.458
And right now, I really, really want to.

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:52.750
<i>OK.</i>

01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:55.791
We're in this together no matter what.

01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:59.000
Listen, this is my mess, not yours.
I need to fix this, OK?

01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:04.916
This number. You're in Berlin?

01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:08.291
Dave, listen to me. Listen to me.
I am going to tell you everything.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.666
I promise. OK? But I need...
I need time.

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:12.583
Do not contact me.
I'm going to contact you.

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:15.125
Uh-uh, that's not how this works.

01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:17.041
Are you in Berlin, Emma?

01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:19.166
Don't! Dave don't, Dave don't. Don't.

01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:21.791
You are my wife. I am coming there.

01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:23.625
We are going to deal with it.

01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:26.500
Dave, do not come to Berlin.
Do you hear me?

01:02:26.666 --> 01:02:29.083
-  <i>You can't come here, can you?</i>

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:31.791
So I'm coming to Berlin

01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:33.583
and we're going to have a conversation.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.250
Dave, do not come to Berlin.
Do you hear me?

01:02:35.416 --> 01:02:37.208
Do not come to Berlin!
I will not be here!

01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:40.875
<i>Dave, do you understand me?</i>

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.083
<i>Dave!</i>

01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:54.250
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:06.625
Em, I just landed in Berlin.

01:03:06.791 --> 01:03:08.625
I need you to call me back.

01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:29.625
I'm sorry, are you with...

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.958
Jack Dawson?

01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.625
Yeah.

01:03:36.208 --> 01:03:37.708
That's me.

01:04:20.583 --> 01:04:22.458
Something to drink?

01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:25.291
Yeah um... Diet Coke?

01:04:26.291 --> 01:04:27.833
Coke light.

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:36.208
Thank you.

01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:44.291
<i>What do you want to drink?</i>

01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:45.625
<i>Coffee, please. Black.</i>

01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:47.541
<i>Sure.</i>

01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:19.208
This is a lot.

01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:24.291
Where are the kids?

01:05:26.375 --> 01:05:27.541
With Molly.

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:29.333
She must hate us.

01:05:29.958 --> 01:05:30.916
She does.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.833
My name is Anna.

01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:39.000
I kill people for money.

01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:42.291
There was something
I was trying to do a long time ago.

01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:43.666
You kill people?

01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:46.708
<i>Here's your coffee.</i>

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:47.708
<i>Danke.</i>

01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:50.458
So, what? Were we y-your cover?

01:05:50.625 --> 01:05:51.958
No. No. Never.

01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:55.083
- You just left us!
- I didn't leave you, OK?

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.458
I needed to...

01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:58.708
I needed to make arrangements.

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:09.500
We're Canadian?

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.583
Was there anything
that you have ever said to me

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:14.125
that was the truth?

01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:16.416
Your parents?

01:06:16.833 --> 01:06:19.250
Your aunt in San Diego?

01:06:28.333 --> 01:06:29.791
I was born in the States.

01:06:31.083 --> 01:06:32.333
My dad was a Secret Service agent,

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.208
turned ex-Secret Service agent
way before he would have liked.

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.250
So he went into business for himself,

01:06:37.708 --> 01:06:40.708
started a private security company
named Sovereign.

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:43.041
With an intelligence agent
named Gwen Carver.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:47.416
Gwen Carver is investigating you.
Some kind of international task force.

01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:49.791
There is no task force,
that's Sovereign.

01:06:49.958 --> 01:06:52.250
All the more reach,
more cover, the better.

01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:55.291
Now that my dad is killed,
she took me in.

01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:58.708
You know,
she gave me a life. She trained me.

01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:00.708
She told me they were all bad people.

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:03.333
I was so young and she manipulated me.

01:07:03.833 --> 01:07:05.625
I know now that she was lying.

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:08.250
I probably knew back then.
I just didn't want to...

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:10.041
admit it to myself.

01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.333
Anyway, I did a job in Boston.

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:15.125
That's when I met you in that bar.

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:19.125
You talked to me like I was a real person.

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:22.458
You made me laugh.
You made me want to start a new life.

01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:25.291
You were never my cover, Dave.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:29.666
You were the first person
I ever truly loved. Wyatt was the second.

01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:32.291
It was the most magical, warmest life
I ever could have dreamed of.

01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:34.500
A life I never even thought I could have.

01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:37.750
I got pregnant, and there was Caroline.
It was like this perfect life.

01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:39.166
But you never stopped!

01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:41.750
It was only once or twice a year
at first, I swear.

01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:43.791
It was to fund our protection.

01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:45.708
The work trips.

01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:47.875
Nebraska?

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.083
Buenos Aires.

01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:52.333
St. Louis?

01:07:54.166 --> 01:07:55.375
Riyad, I think.

01:07:56.750 --> 01:08:00.041
Dave it's my job, OK? It's what I do.

01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:02.666
- I don't know how to do anything else.
- Then take a class!

01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:04.666
I know, you're right.
I should do that, I know.

01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:07.666
I'm going to. Listen, it's done.
I don't want to do this anymore.

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:08.916
Dave, look at me. I miss you.

01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:10.916
I miss doing the crossword puzzle
together.

01:08:11.083 --> 01:08:13.875
I miss sitting on the couch
watching Pixar movies with the kids,

01:08:14.041 --> 01:08:15.666
throwing candy in the popcorn.

01:08:16.083 --> 01:08:17.416
I miss having sex with you in our bed

01:08:17.583 --> 01:08:19.166
before we had to schedule it
on the calendar.

01:08:19.333 --> 01:08:20.500
OK...

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.208
- I love you.
- I know. I love you too.

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:35.916
I love our family.

01:08:37.541 --> 01:08:38.833
But killing is bad.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.500
Like, unacceptably bad.

01:08:40.666 --> 01:08:43.583
I know, I know. I'm done. Done.
I swear it's over.

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:46.333
I just have to tie up
a few loose ends, and then I promise...

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:47.791
It's over.

01:09:02.833 --> 01:09:04.375
Don't worry, I have a plan.

01:09:05.083 --> 01:09:07.875
You stay calm and do what they say.
I know what I'm doing.

01:09:10.166 --> 01:09:11.125
Dave, this is Ji.

01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:13.291
We grew up together. Practically sisters.

01:09:13.791 --> 01:09:16.041
She was the super fun one,
as you could tell.

01:09:16.208 --> 01:09:17.458
Hi, Anna.

01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:20.458
We're kind of in the middle
of a private conversation here,

01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.083
if you guys don't mind, so...

01:09:22.708 --> 01:09:24.708
- Time to go.
-  Um...

01:09:24.875 --> 01:09:26.958
I'm not finished with my coffee.

01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:29.875
So if you and your boyfriend
and your little friends want to head off,

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:32.875
we'll... catch up with you later.

01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:38.583
Hey! Get your hands off...

01:09:41.208 --> 01:09:42.625
-  Ouch!

01:09:51.041 --> 01:09:52.166
Ow!

01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:09.916
<i>How could anyone not love
your furry little friend?</i>

01:11:16.708 --> 01:11:18.916
Let me see, you're so cute.

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:22.000
-  Mom.
-  Mom!

01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:24.500
- Hi! You guys OK?
-  Yeah.

01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:25.833
How did you...

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.583
They've had a long trip.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.541
Now we're reunited.

01:11:29.708 --> 01:11:31.125
That's all that matters.

01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:34.333
You never told us we had an extra grandma.

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.916
No, I didn't. Where's Dave?

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:39.875
Oh, yeah. Daddy is resting.
He's not feeling his best.

01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:42.625
Should we talk elsewhere?

01:11:42.791 --> 01:11:44.000
No, I'm good right here.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:45.958
OK.

01:11:46.541 --> 01:11:49.250
Just don't hold on too tight.

01:11:49.833 --> 01:11:51.208
Don't want to suffocate them.

01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:53.291
What does suffocate mean?

01:11:53.458 --> 01:11:55.041
I'll tell you later, baby.

01:11:55.208 --> 01:11:57.833
Kids? Mommy and I need to talk, so...

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.750
Would you guys like to see
this really cool

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:03.541
and very fun little playhouse

01:12:03.708 --> 01:12:05.666
that we have set up for you?

01:12:06.291 --> 01:12:08.541
- Can we bring the puppy?
-  Of course you can!

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.291
He's yours, right?

01:12:10.666 --> 01:12:12.208
If your mother allows it.

01:12:15.041 --> 01:12:17.250
Of course you can bring the puppy. Yay!

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:21.416
And let's set up that video game system,
OK Carlo?

01:12:21.833 --> 01:12:23.041
Go on.

01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:26.875
-  Yay!

01:12:32.125 --> 01:12:33.083
Tea?

01:12:41.916 --> 01:12:45.083
The unicorn wanted to see the queen

01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:47.250
because she was that rainbow.

01:12:47.416 --> 01:12:51.833
She wanted to make the unicorn
even prettier

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.166
because she wanted her to be a statue
for her castle.

01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:58.083
So I think that's because the queen is...

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.166
<i>You didn't have to bring them into this.</i>

01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:04.750
You brought them into this.

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:08.791
Really, Anna.
Your plan was a little crude.

01:13:08.958 --> 01:13:10.541
Of course, you knew
Dave was going to lead us

01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:12.208
right to you. Huh?

01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:14.500
For you to extract
whatever blunt sort of revenge

01:13:14.666 --> 01:13:15.958
you had in mind.

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.833
And, of course,
we were going to take the kids.

01:13:20.375 --> 01:13:23.375
Did you really think
it was going to be as simple as all that?

01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:26.583
The kids are fine

01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:30.500
if the video games and the dog
don't keep them occupied,

01:13:30.666 --> 01:13:32.333
well, there's ping pong.

01:13:33.166 --> 01:13:36.833
Not that you're teaching them the benefit
of physical exercise.

01:13:37.916 --> 01:13:39.458
The way you're raising them, Anna.

01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:40.583
Emma.

01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:44.375
Emma.

01:13:45.166 --> 01:13:46.458
You barely even changed it.

01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:47.916
My name is Emma.

01:13:49.791 --> 01:13:51.083
OK.

01:13:52.041 --> 01:13:54.416
I see you, hm?

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:56.791
I hear you.

01:13:57.416 --> 01:13:59.166
Is that what you need?

01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:01.333
You've acted out

01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:02.958
all for what?

01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:05.791
So you could pick out dishwasher pods
at Target

01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:08.541
with Dave from New Jersey?

01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:10.250
Yeah, I like New Jersey

01:14:10.416 --> 01:14:12.333
and I love my family.

01:14:13.041 --> 01:14:14.541
I just want a normal life.

01:14:14.708 --> 01:14:16.375
You just want a normal life

01:14:16.875 --> 01:14:19.458
while you're dropping bodies
from Athens to Zimbabwe.

01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:22.000
- I'm not doing that anymore.
- Is that what you told him?

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:24.166
Yeah. I'm fucking done with all of it.
All of you!

01:14:25.375 --> 01:14:27.458
Please, Anna. The language...

01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:28.875
Fuck you.

01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:32.583
You took me.
You're not going to take my kids.

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:35.375
Oh, please. They were given to me.

01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:38.416
Your sister in law was very concerned

01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:40.875
though I think is reassured
that the authorities had it all

01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:41.958
well in hand.

01:14:42.125 --> 01:14:44.166
The ITIC and all that.

01:14:44.666 --> 01:14:46.625
And I never took you, Anna.

01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:48.333
I took you in!

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.750
- I was a child.
-  Stop.

01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:53.375
Stop with the self-pity.

01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:55.458
You're better than that.

01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:57.750
At least you were.

01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:09.291
Don't. I don't wanna see... don't.

01:15:13.625 --> 01:15:15.000
Look at that girl.

01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:16.916
Look at her strength.

01:15:17.666 --> 01:15:18.583
Her power.

01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:20.958
I gave those things to you.

01:15:21.708 --> 01:15:23.583
That makes you mine,

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:25.958
always.

01:15:28.708 --> 01:15:30.166
What do you want from me?

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:32.625
You know what I want.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.125
I want you back.

01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:37.250
We can all be a family.

01:15:37.416 --> 01:15:38.833
Don't you see?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.166
And it's the only way for

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:44.291
your children to have a future,

01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:45.916
to have a life

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:47.958
with you in it.

01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:55.791
You only need to get rid of Dave.

01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:00.708
Just one bullet.

01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:03.708
Even off your game,
I can't imagine you'd need more than that.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.750
Thank you.

01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:26.791
Why don't you just do it?
If that's what you want. You do it.

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.750
I didn't bring him into this.

01:16:31.791 --> 01:16:32.791
Hm...

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:36.458
This will put us on a better footing
to move forward together

01:16:37.166 --> 01:16:38.500
as a family.

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:40.500
Your real family.

01:16:41.833 --> 01:16:44.708
What if I pick it up,
put it in your face and pull the trigger?

01:16:45.625 --> 01:16:49.375
Why don't do you think about
your children?

01:16:49.833 --> 01:16:51.541
For once.

01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:54.250
God knows I think about you.

01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:57.500
My sweet girl.

01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:06.458
Now.

01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:09.583
Take him for a walk.

01:17:10.875 --> 01:17:12.708
A walk in the woods.

01:17:15.958 --> 01:17:17.458
Don't make me do this.

01:17:17.625 --> 01:17:19.541
Shall I entertain the kids
while you're gone?

01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:21.125
No.

01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:23.666
-  We could play a game.
- No.

01:17:23.833 --> 01:17:26.041
- I could read them a story.
- No.

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:28.708
Those perfect little darlings.

01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:31.083
I have so much I can teach them.

01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:34.041
There is always a price.

01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:37.708
- There's always a sacrifice.
-  Don't make me do this.

01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:40.458
I can forgive the worry you've caused.

01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:43.500
- Stop.
-  But you have to meet me halfway.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.458
And this is how you do it.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.166
Now take him for a walk.

01:17:54.458 --> 01:17:56.250
A walk in the woods.

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:08.666
I don't want them anywhere near it.

01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:11.208
My sweet girl.

01:18:24.041 --> 01:18:25.333
Where are we?

01:18:28.666 --> 01:18:30.125
Let's go for a walk.

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:35.416
OK.

01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:38.916
What is this place?

01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:43.125
-  Dave, there's a sniper on us.
-  What?

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.291
It's fine. She's always watching.

01:18:45.458 --> 01:18:47.125
Listen Dave, I need to tell you something.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.250
Tell me something, anything.

01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:51.666
She has the kids.

01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:54.666
They're OK. Stop.
They're fine. Calm down.

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:57.083
- Where are they?
- They're fine.

01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:58.750
They are not hurt. They are happy.

01:18:58.916 --> 01:19:00.833
They have no idea what's going on.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.125
What are we gonna do?

01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:04.416
Emma, what the hell is wrong with you?

01:19:04.583 --> 01:19:06.583
They have our kids.
What are we gonna do?

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.083
Can you hold me?

01:19:15.916 --> 01:19:16.875
Huh?

01:19:17.041 --> 01:19:19.125
You know,
can you hold me like you used to?

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.625
Before all this shit.
Can you just hold me, please?

01:19:23.375 --> 01:19:24.583
-  Please!
- I mean...

01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.291
-  Now.
- OK.

01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:29.250
Oh, OK.

01:19:30.916 --> 01:19:32.291
OK.

01:19:32.458 --> 01:19:33.625
OK. OK.

01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:36.375
Emma,

01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:39.375
what the hell is going on?

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.125
She wants me to kill you.

01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:42.166
What?

01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:48.083
- I'm sorry.
- Emma, I love you...

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.708
- Ah!

01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:33.291
Confirming the kill.

01:21:00.916 --> 01:21:02.583
Wanna give me a hand or what?

01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:07.791
Bitch.

01:22:07.875 --> 01:22:10.208
Emma, what the hell is going on?

01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:16.333
-  She wants me to kill you.
- What?

01:22:16.833 --> 01:22:18.958
I'm not going to.

01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:20.750
It's a clean shot.

01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:22.458
No vitals.

01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:23.833
I know what I'm doing.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.333
Trust me.

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.458
And play dead.

01:22:27.625 --> 01:22:29.458
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

01:22:29.625 --> 01:22:30.875
- Emma, I love you--

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.250
-  Hello there.

01:22:51.625 --> 01:22:53.250
Hey, hey, babe.

01:22:53.416 --> 01:22:54.583
Babe, hey.

01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:56.375
It's me. You can move. Hey.

01:22:56.875 --> 01:22:59.291
- Oh my God, are you OK?
- You really shot me!

01:22:59.458 --> 01:23:01.916
I know, I'm so sorry. Does it hurt?

01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:05.041
- Oh, God. Let me see. OK, listen.

01:23:05.208 --> 01:23:06.833
You just have to apply pressure.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.583
- It is a slow bleed.
- OK.

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:11.041
We get you to the hospital
in four or five hours. You'll be fine.

01:23:11.208 --> 01:23:12.541
- What?
-  Yeah.

01:23:13.125 --> 01:23:15.500
-  OK come here.

01:23:15.666 --> 01:23:16.958
I'm gonna get this off you.

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:20.791
-  OK.

01:23:20.958 --> 01:23:22.416
-  Can you get up?
- No.

01:23:22.583 --> 01:23:24.958
Yes, you can. Come on,
I'll help you. Let me help you.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.625
- Just give me a sec.
- Sorry.

01:23:26.791 --> 01:23:27.666
- OK.
- Come on.

01:23:29.708 --> 01:23:31.166
-  Oh, sorry.
- OK.

01:23:31.333 --> 01:23:32.250
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

01:23:32.416 --> 01:23:33.375
OK babe, listen to me.

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:35.166
I'm so sorry.

01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:36.750
I have to go to work now though.

01:23:36.916 --> 01:23:38.041
- OK.
- OK?

01:23:38.208 --> 01:23:39.666
- You're coming with me.

01:23:39.833 --> 01:23:40.791
- Are you ready?
- OK.

01:23:40.958 --> 01:23:41.916
-  No.
- Yes.

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:43.500
I love you. Just stay close. We got this.

01:23:43.666 --> 01:23:44.500
OK.

01:23:44.666 --> 01:23:46.500
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:23:46.666 --> 01:23:47.833
- OK. Come on.
- You shot me!

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:50.500
Come on.

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:08.333
OK. Yeah. Let's go, come on.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.000
Shit. Come here. Quiet. Quiet.

01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:27.750
- Ouch!
- Sorry.

01:24:29.291 --> 01:24:30.416
OK.

01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:32.250
Stay low and don't look.

01:24:32.416 --> 01:24:33.583
OK. What?

01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:40.083
Hi there.

01:24:54.458 --> 01:24:55.375
You're OK?

01:24:55.875 --> 01:24:56.708
What happened?

01:24:56.875 --> 01:24:59.375
Listen, I know this is a lot,
but I need you now. I need you to focus.

01:24:59.541 --> 01:25:01.375
- I need you.
- OK. OK, I'm here.

01:25:01.541 --> 01:25:02.416
OK. Listen to me.

01:25:02.583 --> 01:25:04.291
The kids are back there
in the guest house.

01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:05.333
I need to go right there.

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.500
- You go to the kids and buy some time.
- Buy some time?

01:25:07.666 --> 01:25:09.708
You're going to take this with you.
It's point and shoot.

01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:10.916
Got it. Point and shoot.

01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:12.750
- With any luck you're not gonna need it.
- OK.

01:25:12.916 --> 01:25:14.291
- Cuz I need you to what?
- Buy some time.

01:25:14.458 --> 01:25:16.208
I need to you buy some time.
I'll be right there.

01:25:16.375 --> 01:25:17.291
Emma?

01:25:18.666 --> 01:25:20.541
- I will be there.
- OK.

01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:24.125
Point and shoot.

01:25:25.916 --> 01:25:27.708
What do you mean, there's no response?

01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:35.375
I just hope
she's not being emotional about this.

01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:47.250
OK, just try not to kill her.

01:25:47.875 --> 01:25:48.916
I want her alive.

01:27:43.541 --> 01:27:45.458
Daddy!

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:47.000
Hi babe.

01:27:47.166 --> 01:27:48.041
Ouch!

01:27:49.833 --> 01:27:51.833
God... Ow...

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.541
We're kind of having quite an adventure,
aren't we?

01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:08.041
-  Daddy?
-  Yeah?

01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:10.791
Are you sure you don't need a Band-Aid?

01:28:13.666 --> 01:28:14.875
I'm fine.

01:28:16.375 --> 01:28:17.708
Oh, that's good.

01:28:46.708 --> 01:28:49.250
It's just the two of us now, Gwen.

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:26.875
Thought you were a better shot.

01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:36.791
We don't have to do this, you know.

01:29:37.666 --> 01:29:39.000
It's not too late.

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:41.750
We can still make this work.

01:29:44.708 --> 01:29:46.208
I do love you, Anna.

01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:53.041
You know I can see you, right?

01:29:55.625 --> 01:29:59.041
I'm still the same woman
who put you in your jammies, remember?

01:29:59.875 --> 01:30:01.208
Tucked you in at night.

01:30:05.041 --> 01:30:07.958
Oh Gwen, I remember everything.

01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:09.833
See how well you taught me?

01:30:26.208 --> 01:30:27.958
Is this about Dave?

01:30:31.333 --> 01:30:34.333
I know you're older now,
so stop acting like a child.

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.250
-  Make me.

01:30:44.291 --> 01:30:46.500
That's enough, Anna.

01:30:47.291 --> 01:30:49.541
That might be it
for your clip, Gwen.

01:30:51.333 --> 01:30:52.291
Fuck.

01:30:52.458 --> 01:30:53.541
Fuck.

01:31:23.166 --> 01:31:24.375
My sweet girl.

01:31:26.166 --> 01:31:27.541
That's what I like to see.

01:31:33.250 --> 01:31:34.666
Finish me.

01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:42.250
Finish me.

01:31:50.166 --> 01:31:52.416
I would love to sit here
and watch you die.

01:31:52.583 --> 01:31:55.666
But Mr. Fluff
and the Monkey Princess are feuding

01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:58.541
and my family's waiting for me.

01:32:18.958 --> 01:32:21.666
I am your boss,
but I'm a nice boss.

01:32:25.458 --> 01:32:27.333
Hey, alligators!
Hi! Time to go, OK?

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.041
-  Do we have to?
-  Yes.

01:32:29.208 --> 01:32:30.666
But Mom, we're in the middle of a race.

01:32:30.833 --> 01:32:33.375
You heard your mom. Time to go.
Get your things, come on.

01:32:33.541 --> 01:32:35.291
Babe are you OK? Any problems?

01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:37.666
- Nothing I couldn't handle.
- OK.

01:32:38.083 --> 01:32:38.958
You?

01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:40.416
It's done.

01:32:40.583 --> 01:32:42.375
Like done, done?

01:32:42.541 --> 01:32:44.916
Done, done.

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:46.333
-  Mommy?
- Yes, baby?

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.458
Did you cut yourself on a tree

01:32:48.625 --> 01:32:50.000
like Daddy?

01:32:50.166 --> 01:32:53.333
Yes, I did. It was an accident.
I'll going to tell you about in the car.

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.375
Let's go. Grab your jackets.
Wyatt, put the game down.

01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:56.500
Come on!

01:32:56.666 --> 01:32:58.583
- Can we bring Tuffy?
- Yes, grab Tuffy.

01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.333
Really? We can keep him?

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:03.750
Well, pick him up before I change my mind.
Shhh. Grab your jackets.

01:33:03.916 --> 01:33:06.000
Let's go. Let's go. Jackets. Jackets.

01:33:06.166 --> 01:33:07.250
Can we get ice cream?

01:33:07.416 --> 01:33:09.041
Come on. Come on.

01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:11.291
What's wrong with Carlo?

01:33:12.916 --> 01:33:15.000
Carlo's sleeping,
we don't want to wake him up.

01:33:15.166 --> 01:33:16.458
So bye Carlo.

01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:18.583
- Bye, Carlo.
- Bye, Carlo.

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.833
Where is my car seat?

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.458
We're gonna get you one babe.

01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:36.333
I need my car seat.

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.750
Honey, don't worry.
This is just for a little bit, OK?

01:33:38.916 --> 01:33:40.958
How did you guys get those marks?

01:33:41.125 --> 01:33:42.708
I don't think you guys got cut by a tree.

01:33:42.875 --> 01:33:45.166
- We got into a fight, buddy.
-  With each other?

01:33:45.333 --> 01:33:46.708
- No.
- No, no.

01:33:46.875 --> 01:33:49.291
Some other guys. Some bad guys.

01:33:49.458 --> 01:33:52.083
It's illegal for me
to not be in a car seat.

01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:54.708
I know honey. Listen, we have to get Daddy
to a doctor right now,

01:33:54.875 --> 01:33:56.416
and then I'm going to get you a car seat.

01:33:56.583 --> 01:33:59.000
You told us we were going for ice cream.

01:33:59.166 --> 01:34:00.958
Yes, I did.
But we got to get Daddy to a doctor.

01:34:01.125 --> 01:34:03.333
Then I'm going to get you a car seat
and then ice cream.

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:04.916
But I'm hungry now.

01:34:05.083 --> 01:34:06.750
- Oh my God!
- I know, I know.

01:34:06.916 --> 01:34:08.458
We could get you a snack on the way.

01:34:08.625 --> 01:34:09.833
What do they even eat in Germany?

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.875
Lots of good stuff.
Bratwurst. <i>Wiener schnitzel.</i>

01:34:14.041 --> 01:34:16.541
-  I don't want that.
-  I don't want that, either.

01:34:16.708 --> 01:34:19.291
-  I want a hamburger.
- OK, hey, hey, hey.

01:34:19.458 --> 01:34:22.666
You heard your mom. We're gonna...

01:34:24.583 --> 01:34:26.958
We're gonna find some place good.

01:34:49.875 --> 01:34:53.458
-  Where are we going?
-  Yeah, where are we going?

01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:56.333
Don't worry. I have a plan.
