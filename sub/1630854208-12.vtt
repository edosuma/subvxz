00:02.530 --> 00:03.820
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...
Hey, Mom,

00:04.020 --> 00:05.350
is everything okay?
I just got served.

00:05.550 --> 00:08.390
Your father wants sole
custody of you.

00:08.590 --> 00:10.010
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

00:10.970 --> 00:13.130
I will not stand by and watch
you become collateral damage

00:13.330 --> 00:14.690
of your mother's
secret life.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.500
ROBYN:
<i>I'm telling myself</i>
<i>that I'm setting</i>

00:16.700 --> 00:18.100
<i>injustice right, but what</i>
<i>does any of that matter</i>

00:18.300 --> 00:20.430
<i>if doing all of that</i>
<i>makes me lose Dee?</i>

00:20.630 --> 00:22.600
Just won't be
equalizing anymore.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.200
I'm officially retired.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.740
Robyn is out there saving lives.

00:25.940 --> 00:27.470
She's gonna
give all of that up

00:27.670 --> 00:30.310
because you are accusing her
of being a bad mother.

00:30.510 --> 00:32.180
The world
cannot afford

00:32.380 --> 00:34.910
to lose Robyn,
and neither can Dee.

00:35.110 --> 00:37.280
Miles is dropping
his petition for custody.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.090
What does this mean for you now?

00:39.290 --> 00:41.590
Well, it means I get to continue
helping people.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.460
<i>Just need to find</i>
<i>a better balance</i>

00:43.660 --> 00:45.870
<i>between work and family.</i>

00:50.010 --> 00:52.230
<i>(punches landing)</i>
<i>(grunting)</i>

00:52.430 --> 00:54.980
(heavy breathing)

00:58.090 --> 01:00.170
Where are they?

01:00.370 --> 01:01.720
Leave them alone.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.540
My family has nothing
to do... (grunts)

01:04.740 --> 01:06.460
(coughs)

01:09.060 --> 01:12.000
Tell me
where they are.

01:14.570 --> 01:17.740
(groans)
(muffled voices approaching)

01:28.750 --> 01:31.170
(muffled screaming)

01:31.370 --> 01:32.560
(laughs)

01:36.660 --> 01:38.730
<i>(gunshot)</i>
(gasping)

01:45.370 --> 01:47.600
* *

01:53.640 --> 01:55.010
(Delilah sighs)

01:56.010 --> 01:57.300
Morning, all.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.670
You're up early.
Ugh, I am loving

01:59.870 --> 02:01.900
the highlights in those braids.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.470
Thank you. I'm just fired up
for my training session

02:04.670 --> 02:06.110
with Mel.
We're gonna work on

02:06.310 --> 02:08.620
submission holds. (grunting)

02:09.430 --> 02:11.640
Uh, change of plans.
(chuckles)

02:11.840 --> 02:13.410
Mel's doing
a great job with you,

02:13.610 --> 02:15.080
but if I'm gonna
train you, too,

02:15.280 --> 02:16.880
you're gonna have to shore up
your fundamentals.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.320
Okay.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.550
Stamina, patience, technique.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.720
All necessary to build
a firm foundation.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.990
The best discipline
for that

02:25.190 --> 02:27.790
is boxing, so I had Dante

02:27.990 --> 02:29.530
pull a favor
and hook you up with someone.

02:29.730 --> 02:32.900
Boxing coach?
The best in the city.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.630
Trust me,

02:34.830 --> 02:36.270
when he's done with you,
your form will be pristine.

02:36.470 --> 02:39.710
I don't know, "fundamentals"
sounds a lot like starting over.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.370
Is that really necessary?

02:41.570 --> 02:43.380
VI: You know what
my father said,

02:43.580 --> 02:44.810
"If you take shortcuts,
eventually,

02:45.010 --> 02:46.510
you gonna
get cut short."

02:46.710 --> 02:47.950
You hear that?

02:48.150 --> 02:49.780
That's the sound of knowledge
being dropped.

02:49.980 --> 02:52.900
(phone chimes)

02:57.740 --> 02:59.710
I got to go to work.

03:00.510 --> 03:02.160
Knock 'em dead.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.580
Protect yourself at all times.
(chuckling)

03:06.680 --> 03:08.980
You be safe.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.340
He lost his memory?
So he claims.

03:17.540 --> 03:20.150
No I.D.,
no recollection of anything.

03:20.350 --> 03:23.230
So, why's he here
instead of a hospital?

03:24.400 --> 03:26.740
Better to let him explain.

03:37.650 --> 03:38.960
Start at the beginning.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.230
Uh... (sniffs)
Uh, well, that won't take long,

03:41.430 --> 03:43.640
seeing as I woke up
in a dumpster this morning

03:43.840 --> 03:45.970
with, uh, with this grapefruit
on my head

03:46.170 --> 03:49.310
and-and no recollection of how
I got it or anything else.

03:49.510 --> 03:50.840
Uh, I wandered
into a pool hall

03:51.040 --> 03:53.280
to keep warm, and
the bartender heard my story,

03:53.480 --> 03:56.920
told me about your message
board, and, uh, here I am.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.920
So, what can you remember?
I mean,

03:59.120 --> 04:02.820
I can remember basic stuff
like-like how to use a fork,

04:03.020 --> 04:06.170
Nazis are bad, always hold
the door open for a woman.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.860
Did-did I get that wrong?
I got that wrong?

04:10.060 --> 04:11.800
Ugh, maybe I'm worse off
than I thought.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
What about the personal stuff?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.400
That's the problem.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.270
I... I don't know
who I am

04:17.470 --> 04:19.190
or where I'm from.

04:20.490 --> 04:22.540
Nothing before
this morning.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.040
So, why not go to the police?

04:24.240 --> 04:26.410
I thought about that,
but when I realized I had

04:26.610 --> 04:28.960
this in my pocket, I...

04:30.000 --> 04:31.450
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.

04:31.650 --> 04:32.550
I just wanted to show you.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.920
I-I don't think
it's loaded.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.460
Well, it is.

04:36.660 --> 04:39.690
(sniffs) And it's been
fired recently.

04:39.890 --> 04:41.760
Serial number's been filed down.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.660
You care to explain that?
I wish I could, but I...

04:43.860 --> 04:45.660
But you can't remember.

04:45.860 --> 04:47.100
Why-why would I have something
like that on me?

04:47.300 --> 04:49.170
In my experience,
people who have a gun on them

04:49.370 --> 04:51.670
are either in trouble,

04:51.870 --> 04:53.610
or they're looking
to start some.

04:53.810 --> 04:55.710
Any chance there's
a third scenario?

04:55.910 --> 04:57.990
'Cause neither of those
sound great.

04:59.060 --> 05:00.050
Listen,

05:00.250 --> 05:03.580
I know you're in
a difficult position,

05:03.780 --> 05:05.380
but this kind of thing
is not what I do.

05:05.580 --> 05:08.490
On your website, it says,
"You got a problem?

05:08.690 --> 05:10.390
Odds against you?
I can help you."

05:10.590 --> 05:14.330
If that doesn't apply to me,
then I don't know what does.

05:14.530 --> 05:16.580
I have nowhere else
to turn.

05:19.750 --> 05:22.100
Well...

05:22.300 --> 05:25.470
if you're a good guy,
and you're in trouble,

05:25.670 --> 05:26.840
I can't exactly turn you away.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.870
And if you're
a bad guy,

05:29.070 --> 05:30.980
then I definitely can't
turn you loose on the city.

05:31.180 --> 05:33.750
Okay, so you'll help?
I'll do what I can.

05:33.950 --> 05:35.010
We'll start
by running prints.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.680
Maybe that'll
give us the who.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.780
Okay, great, great. Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.

05:38.980 --> 05:40.590
I'm gonna have a friend
run tests on this gun.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.820
But if I don't like
what I find out...

05:43.020 --> 05:44.020
It's okay, it's okay.

05:44.220 --> 05:47.490
I just want to know
because...

05:47.690 --> 05:49.360
the not knowing...

05:49.560 --> 05:51.380
is unbearable.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.470
Come on.

05:56.670 --> 05:58.800
Where are we going?
To that dumpster
you crawled out of.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.040
Maybe you dropped something
that'll help.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.830
At minimum,
maybe it'll jar your memory.

06:12.770 --> 06:14.890
* Yeah, we the best *

06:15.090 --> 06:17.190
* All I do is win, win, win,
no matter what *

06:17.390 --> 06:18.460
Keep those hands up.
* Got money on my mind... *

06:18.660 --> 06:20.360
Yup, the
one-one-two combo.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.930
Keep moving! Keep moving!
* Whenever me and Khaled
do the remix *

06:23.130 --> 06:25.180
Good job! Throw one.
* Everybody hands go up *

06:26.550 --> 06:29.030
* And they stay there... *
Stick and move!

06:29.230 --> 06:30.800
Use your jab.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.240
Don't drop your hands.
Stop headhunting.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.940
Detective Dante?
Hey. I'm here.
Off the ropes!

06:38.140 --> 06:40.680
Morning, Delilah.
Morning.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.770
Hands up.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.950
The one-one-two.
This place is intense.

06:46.150 --> 06:48.490
It is. Spent a lot
of time here myself.

06:48.690 --> 06:50.820
Put that weight on him.
Put the weight on him

06:51.020 --> 06:53.230
I got someone special
I want to introduce you to.

06:53.430 --> 06:56.800
That's Manny. Local legend.
Golden Gloves champ.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.530
Went on to have
a pretty good pro career.

06:59.730 --> 07:01.430
Even got a shot
at the title once.

07:01.630 --> 07:02.740
Come on.

07:02.940 --> 07:03.970
* Up, down *

07:04.170 --> 07:06.270
* 'Cause all I do
is win, win... *

07:06.470 --> 07:08.570
That's it, that's it.
Keep the left hand up.

07:08.770 --> 07:09.710
(grunts)
(bell rings)

07:09.910 --> 07:10.940
All right.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.950
Good work, Jackson.

07:13.150 --> 07:14.830
Hey.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.280
Morning, young lady.
So, is this my, uh,

07:18.480 --> 07:19.590
my new student?

07:19.790 --> 07:20.820
I am.

07:21.020 --> 07:22.560
Manny, meet Delilah.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.390
Daughter
of a good friend of mine.

07:24.590 --> 07:27.560
Well, then I have to give you
the special workout.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.830
You're gonna start her
with that?

07:29.030 --> 07:30.810
You know the drill.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.600
They all go through that.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.000
What's that?

07:35.200 --> 07:36.570
You're about to find out.

07:36.770 --> 07:40.110
All right,
I'll let y'all get to it.

07:40.310 --> 07:42.480
MANNY:
Put your stuff over here.

07:42.680 --> 07:43.480
Okay.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.140
So, the most

07:46.340 --> 07:49.150
important thing in any
discipline of fighting

07:49.350 --> 07:52.020
is the footwork,
okay? So...

07:52.220 --> 07:53.490
You're never gonna be
as strong or as fast

07:53.690 --> 07:54.820
as you want to be
unless you have a

07:55.020 --> 07:56.190
stable foundation.

07:56.390 --> 07:58.220
Now, remember, you got to
keep your feet

07:58.420 --> 07:59.390
shoulder width apart.

07:59.590 --> 08:01.260
Left foot forward,
you're gonna sit down

08:01.460 --> 08:04.300
and move the foot first.
Yeah, just like that.

08:04.500 --> 08:07.530
Left foot first. But don't
drag it. Yeah. Don't drag it.

08:07.730 --> 08:09.170
Lift it. Try again.

08:09.370 --> 08:12.070
There you go.
One big circle.

08:12.270 --> 08:15.040
Keep going. Again and again
and again.
Okay.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.110
How long do I have to
keep doing this?

08:17.310 --> 08:17.980
500 times.

08:18.180 --> 08:19.900
Seriously?
Yeah.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.650
Keep going.
Don't stop

08:21.850 --> 08:23.050
until I tell you.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.650
Now that's it.
Keep going.

08:24.850 --> 08:27.000
Okay.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.160
Don't stop.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.530
ROBYN:
Anything familiar?

08:32.730 --> 08:34.060
It's that one.

08:34.260 --> 08:37.630
Okay, the tiniest thing
can trigger recall.

08:37.830 --> 08:40.200
Sights, sounds,
smells.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.150
You never know.
(phone ringing)

08:45.090 --> 08:46.810
Okay, just keep

08:47.010 --> 08:48.570
looking around.
Maybe you'll find a wallet,

08:48.770 --> 08:51.780
I.D., anything.
(phone beeps)

08:51.980 --> 08:53.980
Hey. How'd it go?

08:54.180 --> 08:56.210
Uh, she's excited
to try something new.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.350
Manny'll take good care of her.

08:58.550 --> 09:00.590
Thank you for setting that up.
DANTE: No problem.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.190
Regarding your mystery man...

09:03.390 --> 09:04.820
ballistics on the gun
are gonna take a minute,

09:05.020 --> 09:06.360
but I did get a hit
on the prints.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.810
His name
is Roy Hayes.

09:09.910 --> 09:12.830
Okay, so his prints were in
the system. Why? Do you know?

09:13.030 --> 09:14.800
Wasn't for a crime, but

09:15.000 --> 09:16.940
prints get logged
for all sorts of reasons.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.500
Company background checks,
teaching jobs, um,

09:19.710 --> 09:23.480
military applications.
Oh, one more thing.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.980
His address is in
a small town in Michigan.

09:26.180 --> 09:27.980
So, what's he
doing here?

09:28.180 --> 09:28.980
Good question.

09:29.180 --> 09:30.720
Okay, do me a favor,

09:30.920 --> 09:32.120
send his name
and address to Harry.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.250
Maybe he can find out
more about our Roy Hayes

09:34.450 --> 09:36.420
by poking around his hometown.

09:36.620 --> 09:39.320
Will do. I'll let you know
as soon as those ballistics

09:39.520 --> 09:41.230
come in.

09:41.430 --> 09:42.950
(grunts)

09:43.880 --> 09:47.600
Well, turns out your name
is Roy Hayes

09:47.800 --> 09:49.070
from Michigan.

09:49.270 --> 09:50.240
Roy.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.600
Roy.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.440
My name is Roy.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.310
(laughs) Roy. Huh.

09:56.510 --> 09:57.340
Huh, that's funny.

09:57.540 --> 10:00.580
I-I-I don't feel
like a Roy.

10:00.780 --> 10:03.750
Any memories
coming back?

10:03.950 --> 10:06.420
Um... Roy. Nothing.

10:06.620 --> 10:08.150
I mean, I'm-I'm glad
I have a name.

10:08.350 --> 10:11.090
(laughs) Oh, I was afraid
I was gonna be

10:11.290 --> 10:12.560
"Hey, you"
for the rest of my life.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.290
And Michigan?
Does that mean anything to you?

10:15.490 --> 10:16.830
No. Nothing.

10:17.030 --> 10:19.610
What about the dumpster? What
do you feel when you look at it?

10:23.890 --> 10:25.100
Scared.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.910
That's good.
Instinct can be a form

10:27.110 --> 10:28.310
of memory recall.

10:28.510 --> 10:30.310
Okay, why would I be scared
of a dumpster?

10:30.510 --> 10:32.650
I mean, if I had to guess,
I'd say you were

10:32.850 --> 10:34.710
running from someone, you

10:34.910 --> 10:35.880
tried to hide in here

10:36.080 --> 10:37.480
and banged your head.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.530
ROY:
Running from who?

10:40.170 --> 10:41.790
(gunshots)
Get down!

10:41.990 --> 10:44.010
Look out!

10:45.210 --> 10:47.440
(tires screeching)

10:51.680 --> 10:54.320
Thank God you're okay.
Who...

11:01.160 --> 11:02.780
ROBYN:
<i>There were two of them.</i>

11:02.980 --> 11:04.210
They must've been circling
the block looking for him.

11:04.410 --> 11:05.940
You were right. Roy jumped
into that dumpster to hide

11:06.140 --> 11:07.310
from those guys.

11:07.510 --> 11:09.210
Harry find out anything else
about Roy Hayes

11:09.410 --> 11:11.980
from Michigan?
Yeah, that he was the solo name
on his lease,

11:12.180 --> 11:14.590
and he works at Home Depot.
Harry left a message

11:14.790 --> 11:15.720
for his manager
to call him back.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.960
Meanwhile,
he's gonna keep digging.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.860
Hey, I, um,

11:20.060 --> 11:21.630
don't mean to be
ungrateful, but, um,

11:21.830 --> 11:23.500
these clothes are...

11:23.700 --> 11:26.160
weird.
Yeah, they belong
to my husband.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.800
Listen, I'm gonna
need you to be careful

11:28.000 --> 11:29.720
with that sweater.
I know it may look like...

11:30.620 --> 11:31.870
...a child knit it,

11:32.070 --> 11:34.340
but it's actually
by a very famous

11:34.540 --> 11:36.370
Japanese designer
who no one is sure

11:36.570 --> 11:38.410
really exists.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.410
Hmm?

11:40.610 --> 11:42.550
It's very expensive,
is what all that means.

11:42.750 --> 11:43.750
Oh, okay.
Is what I'm trying to say.

11:43.950 --> 11:45.280
I'll keep that in mind.
Great.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.790
All right, um, by
the way, I, uh...
MEL: Yeah?

11:47.990 --> 11:49.390
Don't stretch it. Oh, Roy...

11:49.590 --> 11:51.560
Check this out. I have a tattoo.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.430
Think it means something?

11:53.630 --> 11:56.130
That you have a thing for lions?

11:56.330 --> 11:57.400
(phone camera clicks)

11:57.600 --> 11:58.930
We should send it to Harry.
MEL: Mm-hmm.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.400
Maybe if he posts it to one
of his tattoo subreddits,

12:01.600 --> 12:03.440
someone will
recognize the artist.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.220
(laughs) You guys
are really good at this.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.440
Oh, also...

12:08.640 --> 12:09.840
Don't stretch the...

12:10.040 --> 12:12.160
I found this
when I was changing.

12:13.230 --> 12:15.680
That is some confusing
manscaping.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.530
MEL:
Yeah, it is.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.520
Hey. I know this stamp.

12:21.720 --> 12:24.790
It's from Sanctuary 57.

12:24.990 --> 12:27.790
Sanctuary? Like a church?

12:27.990 --> 12:29.830
(chuckles)
More like the opposite.

12:30.030 --> 12:32.830
It's a lounge
on the Lower East Side.

12:33.030 --> 12:35.470
Let's just say their clientele
isn't exactly law-abiding.

12:35.670 --> 12:38.920
Maybe I went there for the
"two for one" drink special?

12:41.720 --> 12:42.940
The point is, you were there.

12:43.140 --> 12:44.980
That means,
if anyone saw you,

12:45.180 --> 12:47.080
they might know
what you were up to last night.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.550
MEL:
Yeah.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.720
Listen, I'm gonna take him
down to the club,

12:50.920 --> 12:51.980
we'll check it out. Okay?

12:52.180 --> 12:53.320
Okay, I'll touch bases
with Harry,

12:53.520 --> 12:54.750
see if he dug up
anything else

12:54.950 --> 12:57.870
about Roy's life
back in Michigan.
MEL: Okay.

12:59.010 --> 13:01.280
Roy, we're going downtown.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.600
* Uh! *

13:05.800 --> 13:07.200
* Yeah! *

13:07.400 --> 13:08.330
* What you heard... *

13:08.530 --> 13:09.940
MANNY:
Keep those hands up.

13:10.140 --> 13:11.640
Keep moving.

13:11.840 --> 13:14.010
* On your own,
X gon' deliver to ya... *

13:14.210 --> 13:15.610
MANNY:
Lean back. One-one-two.

13:15.810 --> 13:17.240
One-one-two.
There you go.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.610
Bring that left hand back.
Guard your face.

13:19.810 --> 13:20.880
All right, all right, all right,
take a break,

13:21.080 --> 13:22.310
take a break,
take a break.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.420
Get a little jump rope in.
All right, champ?

13:24.620 --> 13:28.450
* I'll do it again 'cause
I am right, so I gots to win *

13:28.650 --> 13:30.290
* Break bread with the enemy *

13:30.490 --> 13:32.890
* But no matter how many cats
I break bread with... *

13:33.090 --> 13:34.490
You know your stance
is too wide.

13:34.690 --> 13:38.500
An hour and a half later,
and I still can't get it right.

13:38.700 --> 13:39.760
Who knew something
could be so hard

13:39.970 --> 13:41.470
and so boring at the same time?

13:41.670 --> 13:43.940
Look, I know it's frustrating,
but if you want to get better,

13:44.140 --> 13:45.790
listen to Manny. He's the truth.

13:47.020 --> 13:49.770
Haven't seen you
here before.

13:49.980 --> 13:51.410
My first time.

13:51.610 --> 13:52.810
All right.
You come here a lot?

13:53.010 --> 13:55.510
Yeah, every day,
twice a day.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.520
That's pretty hardcore.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.730
I'm training
for the Junior Olympics.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.650
What?

14:01.850 --> 14:03.390
Wow, no way.

14:03.590 --> 14:06.290
That's so cool.
Yeah, it'd be a whole lot cooler
if I make it.

14:06.490 --> 14:09.630
When you make it. I'm Delilah.

14:09.830 --> 14:11.910
Jackson.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.150
Delilah's a pretty name.

14:16.450 --> 14:18.190
Suits you.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.110
So, you training
for something

14:21.310 --> 14:23.060
or just looking
for some self-defense?

14:24.060 --> 14:25.890
It's a little bit of both.

14:26.930 --> 14:28.550
Well, keep at it.
You got potential.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.050
* First we gonna rock *

14:30.250 --> 14:32.280
* Then we gonna roll,
then we let it pop *

14:32.480 --> 14:34.300
* Go, let it go. *

14:40.940 --> 14:42.190
"Two for one" drinks.

14:42.390 --> 14:45.430
Uh, don't you think
it's-it's a little early?

14:45.630 --> 14:47.370
Roy, before,
you were wondering

14:47.570 --> 14:49.270
if you'd come here for
the half-priced drinks.

14:49.470 --> 14:50.970
You must have
remembered that sign.

14:51.170 --> 14:52.470
That's good.
Look around.

14:52.670 --> 14:54.360
See if there's anything
else you recognize.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.880
I... You could have brought me
to an actual sanctuary,

14:59.080 --> 15:00.680
and this would
all look the same.

15:00.880 --> 15:01.850
Okay? I'm-I'm never

15:02.050 --> 15:03.180
gonna get my mind back, am I?

15:03.380 --> 15:04.280
Hey, hey, hey, Roy.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.020
(sighs)
Chill, Roy. Listen.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.420
I saw a lot of head injuries
when I was in the military.

15:08.620 --> 15:09.850
The most
important thing

15:10.060 --> 15:11.590
is to not get
discouraged.

15:11.790 --> 15:14.960
You never know when
a spark's gonna hit.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.590
WOMAN:
Oh, there she is.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.080
Hey, what's up?

15:19.710 --> 15:21.220
Good.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.850
Like that. Come on.

15:26.150 --> 15:29.210
Please stop. That
looks like that hurts.

15:29.410 --> 15:32.440
I just want to talk.
All out of talk, honey.
Now step off.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.610
Easy, girl,
this is designer.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.750
Is it?
Okay... W...

15:36.950 --> 15:38.550
It's a-it's a
damn good knockoff.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.200
I don't want
any trouble.

15:42.770 --> 15:43.890
All right?

15:44.090 --> 15:45.190
What's your name?

15:45.390 --> 15:46.420
Nina.

15:46.620 --> 15:47.760
Okay, Nina,

15:47.960 --> 15:49.530
you saw this guy, and you ran.

15:49.730 --> 15:51.330
Why?

15:51.530 --> 15:52.600
You can tell me or

15:52.800 --> 15:54.430
I can call my friends
at the NYPD

15:54.630 --> 15:56.200
and they can make this block
their new hangout.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.170
I may or may not

15:59.370 --> 16:02.460
have taken his money clip
last night.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.130
That's why you're here, right?

16:06.430 --> 16:09.280
Uh... y-yeah, yes.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.920
Abs... Totally.
Just tell me everything

16:11.120 --> 16:12.520
you know about last night.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.050
How did you meet him?

16:14.250 --> 16:16.490
I was at the club,
I was doing my thing,

16:16.690 --> 16:19.860
and he-he waved me over.
Said he wanted some company,

16:20.060 --> 16:23.550
but... barely
paid attention to me.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.500
<i>I had to do all of the talking,</i>
<i>which, normally, I don't mind.</i>

16:27.700 --> 16:30.670
But, suddenly,
he gets up and tries to leave

16:30.870 --> 16:32.340
before we could
conduct business.

16:32.540 --> 16:35.270
Wait a second,
wait a second. Okay.

16:35.470 --> 16:37.210
You told me
you were in love with me

16:37.410 --> 16:39.480
and you wanted to get married.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.810
Can't blame a girl for trying.

16:42.010 --> 16:44.280
(laughs)
I remember something.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.130
Do you remember
anything else?

16:47.970 --> 16:49.320
No.
MEL: Okay.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.520
Keep trying. You, money clip.
Hey, hand it over.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.260
Come on.
I don't have it anymore.

16:54.460 --> 16:55.860
You know what
a cavity search is, right?

16:56.060 --> 16:57.480
Okay, fine.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.950
I may have spent
some of the money already.

17:05.950 --> 17:07.970
Valor Motel.

17:08.170 --> 17:10.610
You're visiting
from out of town.

17:10.810 --> 17:12.260
This might be where
you're staying.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.050
Thank you.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.500
Come on.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.840
(dishes clattering)
Damn.

17:26.410 --> 17:29.180
You good?
You seem a little off.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.060
I just keep having
these crazy nightmares.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.000
Oh, yeah. I get those.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.900
I get this one recurring one
where I'm on a cooking show,

17:37.100 --> 17:38.400
and I'm right
in the middle

17:38.600 --> 17:41.940
of making a perfect beef
tenderloin wrapped in bacon.

17:42.140 --> 17:44.410
Speaking of tenderloin,
I look down, totally nude.

17:44.610 --> 17:46.380
I mean, I'm wearing an apron,
but, you know, it's too short.

17:46.580 --> 17:48.850
You remember that conversation
we had about oversharing?

17:49.050 --> 17:50.420
I do. I'm sorry.

17:50.620 --> 17:52.120
T.M.I.
Got it.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.920
I think I'm just
stressed out.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.320
Well, don't discount
your dreams, you know?

17:56.520 --> 17:59.270
They say it's your subconscious
trying to tell you something.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.630
Maybe.

18:02.830 --> 18:03.830
I just came to see
if you found out

18:04.030 --> 18:05.360
anything else on Roy.
Yeah, well,

18:05.560 --> 18:07.130
at first, not very much.

18:07.330 --> 18:09.370
Some community
college credits,

18:09.570 --> 18:10.900
rescued a Pekingese,

18:11.100 --> 18:13.710
zero social media presence.
So, I decided

18:13.910 --> 18:15.870
to dig a little deeper,
and the deeper I went,

18:16.070 --> 18:18.640
the more I became
convinced that his

18:18.840 --> 18:21.200
electronic footprint is fake.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.520
What?

18:23.720 --> 18:25.120
Yeah. Something
about the specificity

18:25.320 --> 18:26.880
and the pattern
of the spending.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.520
Normal spending
is more random.

18:29.720 --> 18:30.790
It's, like, too perfect.

18:30.990 --> 18:32.460
You know,
like it's been manufactured.

18:32.660 --> 18:35.190
Based on that
and some other matrixes,

18:35.390 --> 18:37.200
I'm 99% sure that his footprint,

18:37.400 --> 18:39.130
his identity,
was totally invented.

18:39.330 --> 18:41.920
He's not really Roy Hayes.
(phone rings)

18:44.090 --> 18:46.990
Dante, what do you have for me?

18:49.520 --> 18:51.640
This is it.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.010
Number 24.

18:54.210 --> 18:55.410
All right, something in here has

18:55.610 --> 18:56.650
got to tell us more

18:56.850 --> 18:58.420
about me, right?
Why I came to New York.

18:58.620 --> 18:59.950
That's right.

19:00.150 --> 19:02.200
Stay positive.
(phone rings)

19:05.110 --> 19:06.590
Hey, Rob, we just got
to the motel. What's up?

19:06.790 --> 19:07.830
Nothing good.

19:08.030 --> 19:10.400
Ballistics just
came back on Roy's gun.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.610
It was used in a murder
five days ago.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.400
Interesting.
I checked in

19:17.600 --> 19:19.240
with the front manager
on the way in.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.870
Apparently, Roy got here
six days ago.

19:22.070 --> 19:22.940
We going in?

19:23.140 --> 19:24.360
Yeah.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.180
I wouldn't jump to conclusions.

19:29.380 --> 19:30.920
He could have gotten
that gun yesterday.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.690
Having a gun doesn't mean
he's a murderer.

19:34.890 --> 19:37.990
Maybe, but a blood-stained

19:38.190 --> 19:40.980
motel room might.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.370
(exhales) Look at this.

19:52.570 --> 19:54.270
Is Roy Hayes
a killer?

19:54.470 --> 19:55.870
Rob, I hate to say it,

19:56.070 --> 19:57.980
but maybe it's time
we bring him in to Dante.

19:58.180 --> 19:59.010
I'm not so sure.

19:59.210 --> 20:00.450
But what I am
certain of

20:00.650 --> 20:02.250
is your name is not Roy Hayes.

20:02.450 --> 20:04.950
It's an alias
you likely came up with
What?

20:05.150 --> 20:07.690
four years ago
when you turned up in Michigan.

20:07.890 --> 20:11.420
So, okay, so on top
of all this, I'm a fugitive?

20:11.620 --> 20:13.660
This just keeps getting
worse and worse.

20:13.860 --> 20:16.910
Okay, I...
I'm a terrible person.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.330
What other explanation
could there be?

20:19.530 --> 20:22.570
I know all the evidence
is pointing the opposite way,

20:22.770 --> 20:25.440
but my gut is telling me
there's more to this.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.110
Hey, I just got
a hit on Roy's ink.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.840
Uh, there's a guy on a forum
here who says he recognizes

20:32.040 --> 20:34.850
the style and thinks
the artist works in a shop

20:35.050 --> 20:36.900
in Ditmas Park in Brooklyn.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.280
That's less than a mile
from here.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.050
ROBYN: Mel, you take Roy
to the tattoo parlor.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.990
See if anyone can tell you
who Roy was

20:43.190 --> 20:45.390
before he became Roy Hayes.
And Harry and I

20:45.590 --> 20:47.390
will try to get surveillance
footage from the motel.

20:47.590 --> 20:50.830
Maybe it can tell us exactly
what happened in that room.

20:51.030 --> 20:52.730
Keep it nice and loose,
turn the wrist.

20:52.930 --> 20:55.330
Boom, boom, right come through,
turn that hip.

20:55.530 --> 20:57.070
Keep working on that.

20:57.270 --> 20:58.870
You got this.

20:59.070 --> 21:01.140
Hey, young lady,
break is over.

21:01.340 --> 21:03.140
You stop when you're finished,
not when you're tired.

21:03.340 --> 21:06.240
* When this all came along
I starting keeping my eye *

21:06.440 --> 21:08.250
* On the prize money hunt,
I know it's played *

21:08.450 --> 21:10.580
* Soon I was back at square one,
hear what I'm saying? *

21:10.780 --> 21:13.350
* Now I'm back in the ring ready
to fight and I'm staying... *

21:13.550 --> 21:15.500
You know what
to do, man.

21:16.570 --> 21:20.880
* Back in the ring,
back in the ring... *

21:26.380 --> 21:27.720
You saw that?

21:29.180 --> 21:30.740
Hey, it's none of my business.
Yeah, you're right.

21:30.940 --> 21:33.020
It's none of your business.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.160
Sorry for snooping.

21:40.630 --> 21:42.580
It's not like
it's a full-time hustle,

21:42.780 --> 21:44.450
all right?
Every now and again I get paid

21:44.650 --> 21:46.480
to deliver these packages.
It's cash.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.870
Fast and easy.

21:50.670 --> 21:53.090
And I get it. I do.

21:53.290 --> 21:54.310
But?

21:58.380 --> 22:00.060
It's just that, I mean...

22:00.260 --> 22:02.330
you seem like a pretty big deal
around here.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.770
Everyone thinks you really
have a chance to make it.

22:05.970 --> 22:07.640
It'd just be a shame
to watch you jeopardize

22:07.840 --> 22:10.940
what looks like
a really bright future.
That's the thing--

22:11.140 --> 22:12.540
it might not be a future.

22:12.740 --> 22:13.950
Without the cash,
I can't get

22:14.150 --> 22:15.310
the right training,
the right gear,

22:15.510 --> 22:17.010
the right diet...
I understand you got to do

22:17.210 --> 22:18.920
what you got to do,
but there is always another way.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.090
It's not that simple.
I know.

22:21.290 --> 22:23.670
But like someone told me
this morning...

22:24.670 --> 22:26.390
...when you take shortcuts,

22:26.590 --> 22:29.340
eventually you get cut short.

22:30.340 --> 22:32.000
Doesn't matter anyway.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.070
They won't let me stop
if I wanted to.

22:34.270 --> 22:37.450
Look, just, just don't
tell Manny, all right?

22:38.450 --> 22:39.790
I won't.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.690
But maybe you should.

22:45.790 --> 22:47.230
He might be able to help.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.720
HARRY:
<i>Hey.</i>

22:53.920 --> 22:54.950
I got a couple of decent angles

22:55.150 --> 22:57.590
of Roy from
the motel cams.

22:57.790 --> 22:59.720
I found this.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.990
That guy dead or unconscious?

23:01.190 --> 23:02.460
I don't know. His
face is too obscured

23:02.660 --> 23:04.850
so I can't get any facial rec.

23:06.750 --> 23:09.020
Zoom in on that plate.
Yeah.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.340
Okay.

23:13.540 --> 23:16.240
Uh, looks like
the car's registered to

23:16.440 --> 23:17.980
Pedro Martinez.
Wonder if it's

23:18.180 --> 23:19.410
the same guy that just
got tossed in the trunk.

23:19.610 --> 23:20.910
We need to find that car.
It's an older model,

23:21.110 --> 23:22.880
no GPS or roadside assistance.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.520
But let's see
if Pedro left his phone on.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.450
Yep, he did.

23:27.650 --> 23:29.790
Looks like Pedro is stopped
on the side of the road.

23:29.990 --> 23:32.520
Okay, send me that location
and let me know

23:32.720 --> 23:34.580
if that phone moves.
Yep.

23:35.810 --> 23:38.630
Well, I'm... I'm back
to square one. Okay, my name's

23:38.830 --> 23:39.960
not Roy, I'm not from Michigan.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.230
What I do know is that
I'm a murderer.

23:42.430 --> 23:44.200
We don't know that for sure.
What other
explanation is there?

23:44.400 --> 23:45.570
There was a gun.

23:45.770 --> 23:46.900
The blood in
the hotel room?

23:47.100 --> 23:49.860
I did something bad to someone.

23:52.660 --> 23:54.050
Look, if it makes
you feel better,

23:54.250 --> 23:56.180
not everyone thinks
you're capable of murder.

23:56.380 --> 23:59.530
My friend wouldn't
be helping you if she did.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.370
Oh, good, we're here.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.270
And it's closed.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.790
Great. Uh, well,

24:09.990 --> 24:11.700
that was a bust.
Uh, where you going?

24:11.900 --> 24:13.930
The car's this way.
I'm-I'm not...
I'm not sure.

24:14.130 --> 24:15.400
It... Something's familiar

24:15.600 --> 24:17.800
about this neighborhood.
It's like, okay, it's like

24:18.000 --> 24:20.040
my head knows where it's
headed, even if I don't.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.140
Okay, good, uh,
don't think about it.

24:22.340 --> 24:23.560
Just go with it.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.330
Turn left here.

24:33.330 --> 24:34.390
Across?

24:34.590 --> 24:36.570
Think so.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.090
Something about
this neighborhood.

24:40.290 --> 24:42.830
I remember this street.

24:43.030 --> 24:45.480
It feels like I've
been here before.

24:48.050 --> 24:49.630
It's-it's very strong.

24:49.830 --> 24:51.090
I remember it, I re...

24:52.320 --> 24:53.540
Wait!

24:53.740 --> 24:55.890
(kids laughing)

25:02.600 --> 25:04.570
Here.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.250
This is a crime scene.

25:07.450 --> 25:09.150
You know this house?

25:09.350 --> 25:10.150
Yeah.

25:10.350 --> 25:11.960
There's a bedroom in the back.

25:12.160 --> 25:15.240
And-and there's a door
to the kitchen on the side.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.030
I know that, but I...

25:18.230 --> 25:19.860
I have no idea how.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.550
(dialing)

25:22.980 --> 25:25.220
(phone rings)

25:27.720 --> 25:28.940
Hey, Mel.

25:29.140 --> 25:30.510
Something tells me
this isn't a social call.

25:30.710 --> 25:32.740
Unfortunately, no.
I'm at a crime scene.

25:32.940 --> 25:34.150
I just texted you
the address.

25:34.350 --> 25:35.610
Can you tell me
what happened here?

25:35.810 --> 25:37.400
Give me a sec.

25:48.780 --> 25:50.260
Homicide.

25:50.460 --> 25:52.730
Brutal one.
Man was shot.

25:52.930 --> 25:54.770
And the tongue was cut out.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.230
Ten days ago.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.120
Geez.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.040
Could you send me a picture

26:00.240 --> 26:01.440
of the victim's
driver's license

26:01.640 --> 26:03.110
and anything else
you got on him?

26:03.310 --> 26:05.030
This have to do
with your new client?

26:05.930 --> 26:07.140
Maybe. Why?

26:07.340 --> 26:08.680
The number of murders
he's connected to

26:08.880 --> 26:10.950
keeps growing. When am I gonna
get to talk to this guy?

26:11.150 --> 26:13.150
Soon. I promise.

26:13.350 --> 26:15.540
I'm gonna hold you to that.

26:20.070 --> 26:21.830
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

26:22.030 --> 26:23.390
(phone chimes)

26:23.590 --> 26:25.560
Roy.

26:25.760 --> 26:28.950
Do you recognize this man?

26:49.440 --> 26:51.420
That's...

26:51.620 --> 26:53.660
that's my father.

26:53.860 --> 26:55.290
Th-that's my father.

26:55.490 --> 26:58.580
If anyone can tell us
who I am, it's him.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.240
Roy, I'm so sorry, I...

27:05.440 --> 27:07.610
your father was killed here

27:07.810 --> 27:09.360
ten days ago.

27:10.390 --> 27:11.660
What?

27:12.390 --> 27:15.850
Wait, wait, my father
was murdered ten days ago?

27:16.050 --> 27:17.850
And four days after,

27:18.050 --> 27:21.270
you came to town and
you bought a street gun.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.820
Do you think...

27:24.020 --> 27:25.290
Yeah.

27:25.490 --> 27:27.560
I think you came
to town for revenge

27:27.760 --> 27:30.230
and, judging by the blood

27:30.430 --> 27:33.410
in that motel room,
I think you got it.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.680
So it turns out our amnesiac--
the artist formerly known as

27:45.880 --> 27:47.680
Roy Hayes--
is actually Eric Davies.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.680
His mom died when he was young.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.220
He grew up with his father,
Arthur Davies.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.820
ROBYN:
I see.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.550
So after Eric's father's killed,

27:55.750 --> 27:57.290
he comes to town
looking for revenge.

27:57.490 --> 27:58.560
Any suspects in the murder?

27:58.760 --> 27:59.690
HARRY:
Yeah, a good one, actually.

27:59.890 --> 28:02.540
Sending you a pic now.

28:03.580 --> 28:05.300
(beep)

28:05.500 --> 28:07.950
Rodolfo Martinez.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.810
That's the shooter who tried
to take us out this morning.

28:16.010 --> 28:17.470
Well, the guy's
a total psychopath.

28:17.670 --> 28:19.110
He's got a history
of violent crimes.

28:19.310 --> 28:21.110
He went upstate three years ago
for murder

28:21.310 --> 28:22.980
after a gunfight
with a rival went awry

28:23.180 --> 28:25.220
and he killed a passerby.
And the witness

28:25.420 --> 28:27.150
was...
Eric Davies.

28:27.350 --> 28:28.820
That explains the fake ID.

28:29.020 --> 28:31.260
He must have been put into
WITSEC after he testified.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.860
Yeah, well, Rodolfo
should still be in prison

28:34.060 --> 28:35.260
but his sentence was vacated

28:35.460 --> 28:37.360
after a tainted
chain of custody evidence.

28:37.560 --> 28:38.630
So Rodolfo gets out,

28:38.830 --> 28:40.360
he murders Eric's father,

28:40.560 --> 28:42.600
and then he cuts his tongue
out to send a message

28:42.800 --> 28:44.500
to Eric about snitching.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.140
Wait.

28:46.340 --> 28:48.370
The guy Eric stuffed
into that car--

28:48.570 --> 28:50.830
what was his last name?

28:52.360 --> 28:53.810
Martinez.
Same as Rodolfo.

28:54.010 --> 28:56.280
Wait, you think Eric got
the revenge that he wanted

28:56.480 --> 28:59.070
by killing Rodolfo's brother?

29:00.630 --> 29:02.700
I just found the car.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.320
I think we're about to find out
whether Roy-slash-Eric

29:06.520 --> 29:08.340
is a nice guy-slash-killer.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.760
(muffled grunting)

29:32.030 --> 29:33.790
Pedro Martinez?
Yes, let me out!

29:33.990 --> 29:35.150
Now!
Excuse me?

29:35.350 --> 29:36.420
Did I stutter?

29:36.620 --> 29:37.890
Get me out of here!
You know, if it was me

29:38.090 --> 29:39.790
tied up in a trunk all night and
someone found me,

29:39.990 --> 29:42.290
I'd try honey, not vinegar.

29:42.490 --> 29:44.200
Do you know who my brother is?
Yeah. Rodolfo.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.530
Now, unless you want
to spend another night

29:45.730 --> 29:46.560
tied up in this trunk,

29:46.760 --> 29:48.500
tell me about Eric Davies.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.780
How'd it go down?

29:51.690 --> 29:53.600
Okay, have it your way.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.940
W-Wait, wait, wait!
Okay, okay, okay.

29:56.140 --> 29:58.340
I was at Sanctuary
57 Club last night.

29:58.540 --> 30:00.680
Soon as I left, Eric
appears out of nowhere,

30:00.880 --> 30:02.780
Shoves a gun in my face.

30:02.980 --> 30:04.550
Makes me drive us
to this crappy motel.

30:04.750 --> 30:05.680
Why'd he kidnap you?

30:05.880 --> 30:07.550
How the hell should I know?

30:07.750 --> 30:09.950
Okay! Okay, okay.

30:10.150 --> 30:12.020
He took me up
to his room,

30:12.220 --> 30:13.960
took my phone, told me
to call my brother.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.060
I tell him go to hell,
I went for the gun.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.360
It goes off and I got
shot in the leg.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.230
Not your lucky day, huh, Pedro?

30:20.430 --> 30:22.630
So the guy actually
bandaged me up.

30:22.830 --> 30:25.500
Then he makes me call Rodolfo,
tells him he just wants to talk.

30:25.700 --> 30:29.140
Meeting place must've been
around here somewhere, 'cause...

30:29.340 --> 30:31.740
Eric parked the car
and never came back.

30:31.940 --> 30:34.100
My brother take care of him?
No.

30:35.060 --> 30:36.380
But not for lack of trying.

30:36.580 --> 30:38.720
Looks like Eric did a pretty
good job with your tourniquet.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.250
I would thank him.

30:40.450 --> 30:42.390
No, no, no, no, wait!
Come on, come on!

30:42.590 --> 30:46.070
Come on! Let me out
of here, come on!

30:47.370 --> 30:48.860
ROBYN:
<i>Well, at least we know</i>

30:49.060 --> 30:50.430
Eric's not a killer.

30:50.630 --> 30:51.600
Why else would he rendezvous

30:51.800 --> 30:53.200
with his father's
murderer?

30:53.400 --> 30:54.870
Wait a minute.

30:55.070 --> 30:58.270
Eric's bizarre chest hair.

30:58.470 --> 30:59.670
He was wearing a wire.

30:59.870 --> 31:01.440
He was trying
to get Rodolfo to confess.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.470
Wow, that's...

31:03.670 --> 31:05.140
the dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

31:05.340 --> 31:06.740
I mean, you got to
hand it to the guy.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.350
He's got nerve.
Yeah.

31:08.550 --> 31:11.120
So they meet, things
go sideways, Eric has to

31:11.320 --> 31:13.220
run for his life,
then he gets concussed

31:13.420 --> 31:15.290
diving into
a metal dumpster to hide.

31:15.490 --> 31:17.420
The guy's lucky to be alive.
Yeah, well, it's

31:17.620 --> 31:20.460
only a matter of time before
Rodolfo catches up with him.

31:20.660 --> 31:21.690
Where is he now?

31:21.890 --> 31:23.030
MEL:
Eric was so emotional.

31:23.230 --> 31:24.460
He wouldn't leave the house.

31:24.660 --> 31:26.730
So I called Dante
to send in a uniformed cop

31:26.930 --> 31:31.150
to let him inside. I figured
it would spark more memories.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.000
* *

31:54.380 --> 31:56.880
(laughs)

32:10.690 --> 32:12.930
(sniffles, cries)

32:42.990 --> 32:45.230
* *

32:48.700 --> 32:51.120
DISPATCHER:
David 83, we have an officer

32:51.320 --> 32:53.220
in need of assistance.
10th and Broadway.

32:53.420 --> 32:55.290
Report immediately.
This is David 83.

32:55.490 --> 32:58.010
On my way.
ETA five minutes.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.330
Hey, Eric, I have
an emergency call.

33:03.530 --> 33:06.600
Sit tight. I'll have a
patrol car swing by ASAP.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.980
ERIC:
Okay.

33:12.390 --> 33:16.110
It's me.
He's in the house, alone.

33:16.310 --> 33:17.840
RODOLFO:
Don't let him leave.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.990
I'm on my way.

33:34.110 --> 33:35.760
Listen, stay out here.

33:35.960 --> 33:37.940
Keep watch.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.800
(soft clattering nearby)

34:15.820 --> 34:19.620
I've been waiting for this
the last three years.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.640
Turn around.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.240
I want to see your face

34:24.440 --> 34:26.560
when I end you.

34:28.330 --> 34:29.800
What...

34:34.140 --> 34:36.570
Let's you and me
hang out for a bit.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.490
Toss that piece.

34:39.690 --> 34:41.760
Now, normally,
this would be

34:41.960 --> 34:43.630
the point where
I say "don't move."

34:43.830 --> 34:46.810
But in your case, I
kind of wish you would.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.430
Eric!

34:49.630 --> 34:51.700
Whoa, whoa, Eric, Eric!
Hold up a second.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.500
He killed my father.

34:53.700 --> 34:55.170
Cut out his tongue.
I know.

34:55.370 --> 34:58.640
And he will pay, but if you
end his life, you end yours.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.230
I don't care anymore.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.520
Eric, I called your job

35:08.720 --> 35:11.960
in Michigan. I-I asked them
to reach out t-to anybody

35:12.160 --> 35:13.460
who might know you.

35:13.660 --> 35:15.330
That date on your arm--

35:15.530 --> 35:18.010
that's your son's birthday.

35:19.710 --> 35:21.730
Eric, this
is your girlfriend, okay?

35:21.930 --> 35:24.990
You two have a child together.

35:28.590 --> 35:30.840
I have a son?

35:31.040 --> 35:31.710
Yeah.

35:31.910 --> 35:34.210
I love you, Daddy.

35:34.410 --> 35:36.060
Please come home.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.500
(both laughing)

35:42.270 --> 35:43.990
(panting)

35:44.190 --> 35:46.170
Come home, baby.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.780
I remember them.

35:51.910 --> 35:53.910
(grunts)

35:55.420 --> 35:57.620
Thanks for moving.

36:00.650 --> 36:02.810
* *

36:03.010 --> 36:04.540
MANNY:
Think about it.

36:04.740 --> 36:07.010
Before you make a move.

36:07.210 --> 36:09.200
(indistinct chatter)

36:10.300 --> 36:11.880
* You're the love of my life *

36:12.080 --> 36:15.020
* I'm-a push you down,
I'm-a push you down... *

36:15.220 --> 36:17.090
I got some trash I need
to throw out, give me a sec.

36:17.290 --> 36:19.890
* I'm gonna make a foe,
I'm gonna make a foe... *

36:20.090 --> 36:21.910
Hey, my man.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.500
So, I've been
around this neighborhood

36:25.700 --> 36:27.760
about 40 years.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.430
Not too many people
around here I don't know.

36:30.630 --> 36:32.040
So, you're new.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.140
And?

36:33.340 --> 36:34.710
I'm gonna explain
something to you.

36:34.910 --> 36:36.910
I suggest you open up your ears.

36:37.110 --> 36:38.840
No business

36:39.040 --> 36:41.800
is conducted near my gym.

36:43.300 --> 36:44.180
Ever.

36:44.380 --> 36:46.550
That right?

36:46.750 --> 36:48.870
Mm-hmm.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.240
Well, you know what I think?

36:54.280 --> 36:57.430
Sounds like an old rule
from an old man.

36:57.630 --> 36:59.600
Yeah, well...

36:59.800 --> 37:02.730
I suggest
you step back 'cause...

37:02.930 --> 37:05.850
you might find out
just how old I am.

37:09.820 --> 37:11.860
(grunting)

37:15.160 --> 37:17.730
You want some more
of the old man combo?

37:18.730 --> 37:20.070
Is that what you want?

37:20.900 --> 37:22.890
This ain't over, old man.
Yeah.

37:23.090 --> 37:25.610
Just remember what I told you.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.230
Everything okay?

37:31.430 --> 37:33.300
Yeah.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.900
Now, you did the right thing,
coming to me.

37:36.100 --> 37:38.900
Now, you need to stay
focused on your training.

37:39.100 --> 37:40.290
Got that?

37:41.690 --> 37:43.240
Get back in there.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.160
You got work to do.

37:48.260 --> 37:50.160
I got you.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.040
* *

38:03.110 --> 38:05.310
(coughs)

38:06.850 --> 38:09.670
Looking good. Just remember,
keep your feet shoulder-width

38:09.870 --> 38:11.540
apart and li...
Listen to Manny.

38:11.740 --> 38:13.770
He's the truth.
(chuckles)

38:13.970 --> 38:16.410
(chuckles)
Yeah.

38:16.610 --> 38:19.060
* *

38:29.070 --> 38:31.460
(indistinct radio chatter)

38:31.660 --> 38:33.040
Watch your head.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.630
(sighs)

38:35.830 --> 38:36.690
Thanks for your help.

38:36.890 --> 38:39.430
And calling your officer away

38:39.630 --> 38:40.860
sealed it.

38:41.060 --> 38:43.130
I'm just glad Rodolfo is
going back where he belongs.

38:43.330 --> 38:46.990
Third strike means he's
in for a long stay.

38:47.790 --> 38:50.570
Hey, and thanks for hooking
Dee up with Manny.
Ah,

38:50.770 --> 38:51.840
he's gonna be good for her.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.080
Yeah, I think so, too.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.580
She's an impressive
young lady.

38:55.780 --> 38:57.680
That's because of you.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.100
The job you've
done raising her.

39:01.030 --> 39:03.470
Thanks, Marcus.

39:09.940 --> 39:11.430
WOMAN:
And he's reading
about his daddy.

39:11.630 --> 39:13.000
Tell big man when he wakes up,

39:13.200 --> 39:14.200
I'll see him soon, all right?

39:14.400 --> 39:15.200
WOMAN: Love you.
Bye.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.080
Mr. Eric Davies.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.400
Turns out you're
a pretty good guy after all.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.840
It was, uh,
it was a little dicey there

39:22.040 --> 39:23.360
for a second, wasn't it?

39:24.890 --> 39:26.880
Thank you for everything.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.400
Thank you for believing in me.

39:30.900 --> 39:32.880
So, what now?

39:33.080 --> 39:35.270
I am on the first flight
back to Michigan.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.760
Well,

39:38.960 --> 39:40.620
Mr. Roy Hayes...

39:40.820 --> 39:42.940
has a great life to go back to.

39:50.550 --> 39:52.040
VI:
Absolutely.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.000
"Deciduous,"
that was good.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.010
DELILAH: Deciduous?
That's exactly right.

39:56.210 --> 39:58.110
(indistinct conversation)

39:58.310 --> 40:00.160
(Delilah laughs)

40:01.330 --> 40:02.910
I feel like
I'm getting better at this.

40:03.110 --> 40:04.680
VI:
You're getting amazing, Delilah.

40:04.880 --> 40:05.780
Can't believe
you tried to slip

40:05.980 --> 40:08.520
"yo-dell" by me.
Yo-dell?

40:08.720 --> 40:09.820
What the heck is "yo-dell"?

40:10.020 --> 40:11.760
DELILAH: I almost got you.
Hey.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.920
VI: Hi, honey.
DELILAH: Hey.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.590
Hey, we're starting a new round.
You want to play?

40:15.790 --> 40:18.800
Just opened a bottle of the good
stuff. Come relax, hang with us.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.550
There is literally
nothing I would rather do.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.190
Ooh, yeah.

40:26.350 --> 40:28.020
So, Dee.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.670
How's the new training going
with Manny?

40:30.870 --> 40:33.480
Oh, my God.
It was so repetitive.

40:33.680 --> 40:35.060
It was just...

40:36.500 --> 40:37.780
(laughing)

40:37.980 --> 40:39.020
No, I'm serious.

40:39.220 --> 40:41.820
But... you were right.

40:42.020 --> 40:43.190
I mean, Manny
is the perfect person

40:43.390 --> 40:45.320
to train with.
Yeah?

40:45.520 --> 40:48.210
You know he once fought for
the welterweight championship?

40:49.640 --> 40:51.960
You know I once saved
five Afghanistan villages

40:52.160 --> 40:53.850
from being bombed?

40:56.550 --> 40:57.530
(laughing)

40:57.730 --> 40:58.870
I can't top that.

40:59.070 --> 41:01.710
So tell her
what else happened today.

41:01.910 --> 41:03.810
Oh, um...

41:04.010 --> 41:06.680
I met a boy.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.110
And there it is--
the real reason

41:09.310 --> 41:11.720
you want to go back
to Manny's gym.
No...

41:11.920 --> 41:13.750
Okay, tell me everything.

41:13.950 --> 41:15.400
Let's go.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.690
Okay.
(laughs)

41:17.890 --> 41:19.690
Um, so his name is Jackson.
Mm-hmm.

41:19.890 --> 41:21.860
And he's a boxer.

41:22.060 --> 41:24.600
A good start.
He's tall and smart.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.000
Smart is good.
Smart is good.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.670
Brown eyes.
Mm-hmm.

41:28.870 --> 41:30.870
Brown hair.
He's really sweet.

41:31.070 --> 41:32.870
He better be.

41:33.070 --> 41:34.670
Sweet?
Yeah, he's sweet.
