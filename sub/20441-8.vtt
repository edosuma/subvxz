00:06.339 --> 00:08.172
Hey, man, I don't know
who you think you are,

00:08.172 --> 00:09.506
but you're not supposed
to be at this table.

00:09.506 --> 00:11.047
I don't know who you think
you are,

00:11.255 --> 00:13.214
but men aren't supposed
to grow tits, and yet,

00:13.547 --> 00:15.547
there they are,
atop your little paunch.

00:17.923 --> 00:19.714
Get outta there,
I wanna sit next to this guy!

00:22.047 --> 00:23.214
So, Erlich, good news,

00:23.214 --> 00:25.589
Keenan Feldspar
signed his term sheet.

00:25.589 --> 00:26.756
Fantastic!

00:26.964 --> 00:29.130
Hello, everyone.
I'm very excited to introduce...

00:30.673 --> 00:31.714
The Box.

00:35.005 --> 00:36.839
Last night was...

00:36.839 --> 00:39.673
Worst sex I think I've ever had
by far.

00:40.089 --> 00:41.756
If we could just close the deal?

00:41.756 --> 00:43.381
If it's okay with Dan,
it's fine with me.

00:43.673 --> 00:45.923
Richard, I need you
to look me in the eye,

00:45.923 --> 00:47.506
and tell me that this
is gonna work.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.255
'Cause if it doesn't
I'm completely fucked.

00:56.297 --> 00:59.214
- A little to the right.
- The right more. More.

00:59.214 --> 01:01.631
More. Woof! Aces.

01:01.631 --> 01:04.047
We did it.
Busy?

01:04.047 --> 01:05.422
Hey! Come on in.

01:05.422 --> 01:07.255
I'm just putting
the finishing touches

01:07.255 --> 01:09.422
on Bachman's
Operational Center.

01:09.422 --> 01:11.381
Can you believe
that I talked the ladies

01:11.381 --> 01:14.339
into letting me keep
that little piece
of genius in here?

01:14.339 --> 01:18.130
Oh! Sweet.
Sweet indeed.
It's human hair.

01:18.130 --> 01:20.422
Where have you been?
We've been trying
to close your deal.

01:20.422 --> 01:23.964
Monica and Laurie
are really fighting me
on one final deal point,

01:23.964 --> 01:27.464
and I was getting bummed,
so I turned my phone off,

01:27.464 --> 01:29.130
went kitesurfing in Fiji.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.172
When I got back,
I was chill again,

01:32.172 --> 01:34.798
and I got a message
that they agreed.

01:34.798 --> 01:36.172
So, you closed?

01:36.172 --> 01:40.506
Yep!
What was that one little,
pesky deal point?

01:40.506 --> 01:41.881
I think you're gonna like it.

01:43.714 --> 01:47.214
Fuck yeah!

01:59.547 --> 02:00.839
A keyman clause?

02:00.839 --> 02:05.130
Yes, and said keyman is
none other than yours truly.

02:05.130 --> 02:08.339
It's the highest honor
that you can bestow on a VC.

02:08.339 --> 02:11.089
Wow. So, you get shares
in the company.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.547
No.
So, you get a seat
on the board.

02:13.547 --> 02:14.589
I do not.

02:15.631 --> 02:18.631
A bonus?
There's no cash involved,

02:18.631 --> 02:23.547
but if Monica or Laurie tries
to oust me from Bream-Hall,

02:23.547 --> 02:26.839
Keenan Feldspar can void
the deal and walk.

02:26.839 --> 02:30.005
So, basically, this new title
just means that you,

02:30.005 --> 02:33.172
for sure, get to keep
your shitty desk job.

02:33.172 --> 02:34.589
Congratulations,
but, Erlich,

02:34.589 --> 02:36.547
can you please
turn on the heat?
It's freezing in here.

02:36.547 --> 02:39.381
Tsk-tsk, Richard.
Negativity.

02:39.381 --> 02:41.422
Hey, have you seen
Keenan's demo?

02:41.422 --> 02:43.631
Reddit is
shitting itself over it.

02:43.631 --> 02:46.214
Of course I've seen it.
I'm his keyman.

02:46.214 --> 02:50.464
He gave me one
of the first opportunities
to shit myself over it.

02:50.464 --> 02:52.381
It's that good?
Guys, come on.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.130
How good can it be?
VR is just a fad.

02:55.130 --> 02:59.798
Oh, Richard.
I've forgotten what an envious
little crone you can be.

02:59.798 --> 03:03.589
Envious? Me? Of who?
Keenan Feldspar?

03:03.589 --> 03:07.130
Of course. Keenan was born
with a golden horseshoe
up his ass,

03:07.130 --> 03:10.923
while you sit here
toiling away in an icebox
you call your home office,

03:10.923 --> 03:13.089
cursed with the Midas touch
of shit.

03:13.089 --> 03:15.381
I'm not cursed,
and the icebox

03:15.381 --> 03:17.839
you're referring to
is your house, okay?

03:19.756 --> 03:21.506
What?

03:21.506 --> 03:24.589
Uh, guys, I just got
a billing alert from Azure.

03:24.589 --> 03:27.214
Apparently,
all of our cold data
has gone hot,

03:27.214 --> 03:30.089
so we've already exceeded
our monthly server budget.

03:30.089 --> 03:32.714
Monthly? Bullshit.
It's been four days.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.547
What the fuck?

03:35.547 --> 03:38.297
We have to store
Melcher's data there until
we have enough phones.

03:38.297 --> 03:39.589
We can't afford this.

03:39.589 --> 03:41.798
I'm gonna call Melcher.

03:41.798 --> 03:43.631
Hey, Richard.
How we doing?

03:43.631 --> 03:45.297
Is there something
going on with your data?

03:45.297 --> 03:48.547
Because it was
basically parked
until a few hours ago

03:48.547 --> 03:52.130
when it started flying on
and off our network like crazy.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.297
Well, aren't you--
aren't you watching
the weather channel?

03:54.297 --> 03:56.339
No, why?
Is there a hurricane
or something?

03:56.339 --> 03:59.130
Worse. It's cold outside.
Okay. So?

03:59.130 --> 04:01.923
California looses its mind
when it gets cold.

04:01.923 --> 04:03.673
Citrus trees start freezing.

04:03.673 --> 04:06.547
Sometimes there's
actual frost on the road,

04:06.547 --> 04:08.923
you know, then people start
filing claims like crazy.

04:08.923 --> 04:11.964
Our whole office is
going nuts right now.

04:11.964 --> 04:14.130
Well, that kind

04:14.130 --> 04:15.964
of data traffic
is costing us a fortune.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.880
That's the beauty
of the deal we made, Richard.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.880
You agreed to store
our data for a flat rate.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.923
Everyone else in my division
is getting gouged

04:21.923 --> 04:24.172
on their storage
and bandwidth fees
right now,

04:24.172 --> 04:27.798
but thanks to you,
I look like a genius.

04:27.798 --> 04:29.631
I'll tell Liz you say hi.
Oh. Oh no.

04:29.631 --> 04:30.839
No, no, that's okay.

04:34.255 --> 04:37.673
What did he say?
He says hi.

04:37.673 --> 04:40.214
And that we are responsible
for the overages.

04:40.214 --> 04:42.714
Fuck!
Maybe you are cursed.

04:42.714 --> 04:44.673
I'm not. That's ridiculous.
There's no such thing.

04:44.673 --> 04:46.589
Fucking what?

04:46.589 --> 04:50.214
Richard, a bill of this size
is going to be problematic.

04:50.214 --> 04:52.005
Problematic?

04:52.005 --> 04:55.464
Catastrophic.
We're not gonna be able
to pay that bill,

04:55.464 --> 04:57.422
so our server's
gonna get cut off,

04:57.422 --> 04:59.381
which means
we're gonna lose
Melcher's data,

04:59.381 --> 05:00.923
which means
he's gonna sue us

05:00.923 --> 05:02.923
and seize our assets
and our patents,

05:02.923 --> 05:05.005
and the entire future
of the fucking Internet

05:05.005 --> 05:08.255
is gonna belong
to a fucking insurance company!

05:08.255 --> 05:09.881
I can't take
this shit anymore!

05:09.881 --> 05:11.297
Admit it!
We're fucked.

05:11.297 --> 05:13.422
Okay, let's just think.
Let's just think.

05:13.422 --> 05:17.714
Dan Melcher runs
a very conservative
insurance company,

05:17.714 --> 05:21.631
but even he was
willing to pay us up front
for data storage, right?

05:21.631 --> 05:25.339
True. Although,
that was complicated.

05:25.339 --> 05:29.964
What?
It-- it's just a such
a in-the-weeds deal.

05:29.964 --> 05:31.881
Point being,
we can find
another customer,

05:31.881 --> 05:36.047
and then use
that upfront payment
to cover Melcher's fees.

05:36.047 --> 05:39.631
That's like getting
a new credit card to pay off
your old credit card.

05:39.631 --> 05:43.631
Yeah, and as CFO,
I should tell you we've
already done that seven times.

05:43.631 --> 05:46.255
Look, I don't have
any moral issue
with any of that,

05:46.255 --> 05:47.798
but it was hard enough
to get Melcher.

05:47.798 --> 05:50.422
How the fuck
are we gonna get
a second Melcher?

05:52.964 --> 05:54.714
It's cold out here.

05:54.714 --> 05:56.631
Can almost see
my breath, huh?

05:56.631 --> 05:58.422
What do you want?

06:00.255 --> 06:01.297
Well, uh...

06:02.798 --> 06:05.297
it's just that the guys
are a little agitated,

06:05.297 --> 06:08.964
because we seem to be having
minor money troubles.

06:08.964 --> 06:11.381
I was thinking since you
and Bream-Hall signed

06:11.381 --> 06:14.255
such a big check
over to Keenan Feldspar

06:14.255 --> 06:15.923
and since you are
his keyman,

06:15.923 --> 06:19.673
maybe you could help
set up a data storage deal
like we had with Melcher?

06:19.673 --> 06:21.673
Merely tens
of minutes ago,

06:21.673 --> 06:25.631
you were rubbing VR's face
in a pile of its own make--

06:25.631 --> 06:27.297
that means shit--

06:27.297 --> 06:30.089
and now VR is supposed
to be your lifeboat?

06:30.089 --> 06:35.047
Just to remind you,
Erlich, you are also
an investor in Pied Piper.

06:35.047 --> 06:37.464
It would be good
for everyone,
including you.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.255
Very well.

06:39.255 --> 06:41.923
Fill me in on the details
of your little proposal.

06:42.964 --> 06:44.297
Pitch.

06:44.297 --> 06:45.964
What do you mean?

06:45.964 --> 06:47.547
You-- you know the details.

06:47.547 --> 06:50.047
You were there with me
for every single pitch meeting.

06:50.047 --> 06:55.631
And I'm sorry
that I wasn't key
in those meetings,

06:55.631 --> 06:58.506
so I don't recall
all of the little
nitty-gritty details.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.839
...saving you 25 percent
on your data storage,

07:06.839 --> 07:10.589
which makes us pretty deserving
of the Weissman trophy.

07:10.589 --> 07:13.881
You know, the Heisman trophy
from athletics.

07:14.839 --> 07:17.673
Dude.
This demo is insane.

07:17.673 --> 07:19.839
Gentlemen, you're stepping
on Richard's laughs.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.964
I'm sorry,
but I walked up a hill,

07:21.964 --> 07:24.339
and on top of the hill,
there was a tavern.

07:24.339 --> 07:27.005
And I walked
into the tavern

07:27.005 --> 07:29.297
and I could
just look everywhere,
and there was a barmaid.

07:29.297 --> 07:31.839
Guess what.
I walked right up
to the barmaid,

07:31.839 --> 07:35.005
and I just looked at her
for a really long time.

07:35.005 --> 07:37.381
This technology
could change the world.

07:37.381 --> 07:40.089
I'm not one to gush,
but the possibilities

07:40.089 --> 07:43.589
of your consequence-free reality
are darkly promising.

07:43.589 --> 07:46.339
So stoked you guys
liked it. I hacked it
together last summer

07:46.339 --> 07:48.506
and I just guessed right
on a lot of the details.

07:48.506 --> 07:49.756
But if you think
that was cool,

07:49.756 --> 07:51.714
wait till you see
our final hardware,

07:51.714 --> 07:53.464
which is en route from China.

07:53.464 --> 07:54.673
It's gorgeous.

07:54.673 --> 07:56.798
Well, enjoy it
while it lasts,

07:56.798 --> 07:59.130
just 'cause, you know,
this can be a tough business.

07:59.130 --> 08:02.297
Is it?
So, Richard...

08:02.297 --> 08:04.464
...you wanna try the demo?

08:04.464 --> 08:07.422
Uh, no thanks.
No, I'm-- I'm not a VR guy.

08:07.422 --> 08:10.464
Richard doesn't like things
that are cool or fun
or taste good.

08:10.464 --> 08:12.255
Plus, it makes him queasy.

08:12.255 --> 08:14.506
He has a sensitive constitution.

08:14.506 --> 08:15.964
Ah, come on.
You're gonna do it.

08:15.964 --> 08:17.673
Look at him.
He's gonna do it.

08:17.673 --> 08:20.047
It's gonna be awesome!
Come on! You're doing it!

08:20.047 --> 08:22.255
Come on, come on.
After you.
Okay, sure. I guess. Fine.

08:28.381 --> 08:29.339
Wow.

08:29.339 --> 08:31.214
You really vomited a lot...

08:31.214 --> 08:34.172
and, like, immediately.
Yeah. Yeah.

08:34.172 --> 08:37.422
- Bad luck, I guess.
- Yeah, so...

08:37.422 --> 08:42.172
Look, anyway,
about that data storage deal?

08:42.172 --> 08:45.714
Oh. Yeah. If Erlich says
it works, that's good enough
for me. Let's do it.

08:45.714 --> 08:47.255
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah.

08:47.255 --> 08:48.506
Perfect. That's great.

08:48.506 --> 08:50.422
Um... well,
I guess we should
get back to the house,

08:50.422 --> 08:52.381
draw up some paperwork
for that.
Mm-hmm.

08:52.381 --> 08:55.506
We should be able
to pull everything together
by Monday.

08:55.506 --> 08:59.464
Is it cool if we hang out,
just to, like, play around
with the VR some more?

08:59.464 --> 09:02.089
Okay, but I'm sure
Keenan's busy.

09:02.089 --> 09:03.589
Nah!
You guys should stay.

09:03.589 --> 09:05.756
You want a beer?
I just put in a fresh keg.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.881
He put in a fresh keg.

09:09.881 --> 09:13.464
It's so warm in here.
That would be
the subfloor heating.

09:13.464 --> 09:15.172
I didn't even know I had it.

09:15.172 --> 09:17.130
It just came with the house.

09:17.130 --> 09:18.673
That's nice.

09:18.673 --> 09:21.714
What are you telling me?
Box Two is delayed?

09:21.714 --> 09:25.631
We were already
facing some design
and production challenges,

09:25.631 --> 09:27.339
but then this cold snap
happened.

09:27.339 --> 09:29.381
Apparently there was frost
on the loading dock

09:29.381 --> 09:31.214
at our microprocessor plant
in Acton.

09:31.214 --> 09:33.214
So, it's cold outside.

09:33.214 --> 09:36.214
Why does everyone
in this state have to be
such a wimp about it?

09:36.214 --> 09:39.798
Well, a semitruck slid
right through the door
and hit the main breaker panel

09:39.798 --> 09:41.673
and melted down
the entire facility.

09:41.673 --> 09:43.964
The driver was incinerated,
instantly.

09:43.964 --> 09:46.464
I see. Well, our thoughts
and prayers, obviously,

09:46.464 --> 09:48.464
but we'll still be ready
to roll out in time

09:48.464 --> 09:49.673
for Hoolicon, right?

09:52.422 --> 09:55.547
Guys. Hey.
I'm not Gavin Belson.

09:55.547 --> 10:00.005
You can be honest with me?
How many days will
this set us back?

10:00.005 --> 10:02.297
We're going to miss
delivery of product...

10:02.297 --> 10:03.964
by two quarters.

10:08.881 --> 10:12.255
You realize Hoolicon
is in one week, right?

10:12.255 --> 10:15.464
I mean, it's my first Hoolicon
as CEO of this company.

10:15.464 --> 10:18.839
I... I'm supposed
to get up on stage,

10:18.839 --> 10:20.881
in front of an audience
of thousands,

10:20.881 --> 10:24.547
and deliver a keynote
presentation built entirely

10:24.547 --> 10:26.881
around the release of Box Two!

10:26.881 --> 10:30.089
I was going to descend
onto the stage,

10:30.089 --> 10:31.673
in a giant box.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.422
Boom!

10:33.422 --> 10:34.881
Jack-in-the-box.

10:34.881 --> 10:36.631
Then Mike Tyson
and Floyd Mayweather

10:36.631 --> 10:38.005
were gonna come out and box

10:38.005 --> 10:40.589
over who was gonna get
to take home the first new box!

10:40.589 --> 10:43.714
These are world-class puns!
Now I got nothing!

10:48.547 --> 10:50.464
Hello?

10:50.464 --> 10:51.923
Hey, guys!

10:52.923 --> 10:54.381
I have something to show you.

10:54.381 --> 10:57.214
Have you been here
all weekend?
Is that the sushi guy?

10:57.214 --> 10:59.756
Matching pajamas.

10:59.756 --> 11:01.589
You guys look
like you're in a cult.

11:01.589 --> 11:03.381
Oh, Keenan gets these
for free.

11:03.381 --> 11:05.756
Yeah, we're not
gonna wear the same thing
three days straight.

11:05.756 --> 11:07.547
You gotta come
check this out.

11:07.547 --> 11:08.881
This way!

11:14.714 --> 11:18.756
Wow. I didn't feel sick
at all, not once.

11:18.756 --> 11:20.422
Not even going up
the hill?

11:20.422 --> 11:23.047
No. No-- no nausea at all.

11:23.047 --> 11:24.714
Yeah, I felt fine
the entire time.

11:24.714 --> 11:28.130
What'd you do?
Did you reduce the latency?

11:28.130 --> 11:29.839
I didn't. You did!

11:29.839 --> 11:31.422
Dinesh and Gilfoyle
helped me integrate

11:31.422 --> 11:33.589
your middle-out compression
algorithm into my codec.

11:33.589 --> 11:35.798
I'm sorry. What?
It's off the charts now, man!

11:35.798 --> 11:37.798
We were even able to push
the barmaid to the cloud.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.756
These two guys
are mad geniuses.

11:39.756 --> 11:41.047
Hang on.
I have something for ya.

11:41.047 --> 11:42.297
Mm-hmm.

11:45.589 --> 11:47.547
What the fuck?

11:47.547 --> 11:50.422
You just gave
our proprietary technology

11:50.422 --> 11:53.214
to this asshole
without even running it
by me first?

11:53.214 --> 11:55.464
Are you serious?
We were just hanging out,

11:55.464 --> 11:58.130
and he was like,
"We should try it,"
and he said we could delete it,

11:58.130 --> 11:59.839
and then he started
getting really excited.

11:59.839 --> 12:02.172
And then he said, you know,
"You're doing it,"
a bunch of times,

12:02.172 --> 12:05.422
and then we did it.
And then we started
getting really excited,

12:05.422 --> 12:07.881
and it was so exciting.
And it worked.

12:07.881 --> 12:09.714
The VR is rad now.

12:09.714 --> 12:11.589
Gilfoyle, "rad"?

12:11.589 --> 12:14.923
You are wearing
the exact same pajamas
as Dinesh,

12:14.923 --> 12:16.506
and you're saying
"rad" now?

12:16.506 --> 12:20.589
You have been sucked
entirely into his little...
Keenan vortex.

12:20.589 --> 12:21.964
Okay.

12:21.964 --> 12:23.964
I grant you, with...

12:23.964 --> 12:26.589
the benefit of even
a second's distance,

12:26.589 --> 12:27.881
this isn't a good look.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.881
I don't know.
I think we look rad.

12:29.881 --> 12:32.089
Just-- just
hear Keenan out, okay?

12:32.089 --> 12:35.172
On what?
Here you go, Richard.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.339
What's this?
It's an offer.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.047
I want to acquire
Pied Piper.
Oh.

12:45.673 --> 12:50.005
Bingo-- 2009,
the HooliPad touchscreen
was recalled

12:50.005 --> 12:52.839
five days before Gavin Belson's
Hoolicon keynote.

12:52.839 --> 12:56.673
Now, if he can pull
something together that fast,
certainly I can.

12:56.673 --> 12:58.839
Well, sir, I really
don't see the value

12:58.839 --> 13:01.005
in you comparing yourself
so closely to Gavin Belson.

13:01.005 --> 13:03.005
Meaning what exactly?

13:03.005 --> 13:04.673
Nothing. Just that...

13:04.673 --> 13:08.798
he's considered
the greatest showman
the tech world has ever seen.

13:10.005 --> 13:12.005
I mean,
just look at him.

13:12.005 --> 13:13.381
We've blown away

13:13.381 --> 13:16.464
the FIPS 140-2 standard
for security,

13:16.464 --> 13:21.005
and that's been certified
by NIST/CSE, as you can see...

13:21.005 --> 13:22.381
Wow.
...there.

13:22.381 --> 13:25.798
Look at the confidence,
the poise.

13:25.798 --> 13:27.047
Look at the stage presence.

13:27.047 --> 13:31.381
...is accessible--
here we go--

13:31.381 --> 13:33.673
through the drop-down menu...

13:34.714 --> 13:36.464
there.
How could I top that?

13:36.464 --> 13:38.964
Oh, I don't think
anyone ever will.

13:38.964 --> 13:42.005
When he looked at you,
you felt like you were

13:42.005 --> 13:44.047
the only two people
in the world.
Hoover.

13:44.047 --> 13:45.839
Yes, sir.

13:45.839 --> 13:48.381
Get the fuck
out of my office
this instant.

13:48.381 --> 13:50.756
- Sorry, sir.

13:50.756 --> 13:53.005
Anyone here use
our enterprise server?

13:53.005 --> 13:54.589
We've taken
secure authentication

13:54.589 --> 13:56.714
to a whole other level.
Jack Barker...

13:56.714 --> 13:58.172
you're gonna need a miracle.

13:58.172 --> 14:01.214
Anyone care to talk
secure biometrics?

14:01.214 --> 14:03.631
Well, considering
our looming debts,

14:03.631 --> 14:05.422
and the embryonic state
of our network,

14:05.422 --> 14:07.422
this is a very generous offer.

14:07.422 --> 14:09.214
But we're not for sale, guys.

14:09.214 --> 14:11.714
Richard, listen, it's like
we've been lost at sea

14:11.714 --> 14:13.464
for a long time on a tiny boat,

14:13.464 --> 14:14.756
and there is no wind.

14:14.756 --> 14:16.589
And now, through sheer luck,

14:16.589 --> 14:18.923
we've just happen to drift
right up to Hawaii.

14:18.923 --> 14:21.839
Now, we can continue sailing
into the unknown,

14:21.839 --> 14:24.881
and probably sink or die
of starvation or scurvy,

14:24.881 --> 14:27.297
or we can get off in Hawaii.

14:27.297 --> 14:29.255
Let's get off in Hawaii.

14:29.255 --> 14:31.631
What's so good
about Hawaii?
Have you never been?

14:31.631 --> 14:34.047
No.
It's very nice.

14:35.464 --> 14:36.547
I think we should take it.

14:36.547 --> 14:39.255
Okay, everything
Keenan touches turns to gold,

14:39.255 --> 14:40.255
and you...

14:41.798 --> 14:43.381
are different than that.

14:43.381 --> 14:46.339
I want to go to Hawaii.

14:49.464 --> 14:51.964
Fucking Keenan Feldspar.

14:51.964 --> 14:53.673
How dare he put me
in this position?

14:53.673 --> 14:56.089
Everything just comes
so easy to him.

14:56.089 --> 14:58.964
He invents one little thing,
and then he's gonna make
a billion dollars,

14:58.964 --> 15:01.631
and just,
"Oh, Keenan Feldspar gets
whatever he wants,"

15:01.631 --> 15:03.964
and now I have to be
the ogre that says no
to him. Great.

15:03.964 --> 15:07.547
Richard, you are my captain,
and I'm your mate.

15:07.547 --> 15:10.047
And I will sleep
in the bilge with the vermin,

15:10.047 --> 15:12.547
and I will eat hardtack,
and I will say, "Thank you."

15:12.547 --> 15:14.839
And if duty requires,
I will stand on deck,

15:14.839 --> 15:18.089
and I will salute you
as we sink beneath the waves.

15:18.089 --> 15:19.964
But as poor as our odds are,

15:19.964 --> 15:22.506
I'm worried that
if we turn down this offer,

15:22.506 --> 15:24.005
we will lose
the rest of our crew,

15:24.005 --> 15:26.506
and if that happens,
you will lose everything,

15:26.506 --> 15:29.381
Richard.
Your algorithm.

15:29.381 --> 15:31.881
So, you're saying that

15:31.881 --> 15:33.506
if I say no to this...

15:34.673 --> 15:36.464
I risk having a mutiny
on my hands.

15:37.422 --> 15:39.214
Aye, Captain.

15:40.381 --> 15:41.673
Thanks.

15:53.839 --> 15:55.881
Fuck you,
Keenan Feldspar.

15:56.881 --> 15:59.005
Whoa.
Problem?

16:00.172 --> 16:02.923
Your counteroffer here
is really, really high.

16:02.923 --> 16:06.255
Yes, but after crunching
the old numbies, um,

16:06.255 --> 16:08.839
there's no way we could make
an acquisition work

16:08.839 --> 16:11.089
for even just a penny less
than that number right there,

16:11.089 --> 16:13.130
you know,
what with the patent
and the IP.

16:13.130 --> 16:15.172
And you said yourself,
my guys are the best.

16:15.172 --> 16:18.381
So, Keenan, as you know,
the best is expensive.

16:18.381 --> 16:21.464
This is more than I just took
in funding from Bream-Hall,

16:21.464 --> 16:23.297
and you want all cash.

16:23.297 --> 16:25.047
I can't do that.
Really?

16:25.047 --> 16:28.714
Oh... rats.
Rats, rats, rats.

16:28.714 --> 16:31.047
Weird.

16:31.047 --> 16:33.756
I wanted this to happen,
but it didn't.

16:33.756 --> 16:37.798
That sucks.
I wanted it too,
very badly.

16:37.798 --> 16:40.756
But, um... you know,
what they say in life,

16:40.756 --> 16:42.381
"You can't always get
what you want."

16:42.381 --> 16:44.422
This feeling sucks.

16:44.422 --> 16:45.881
Trust me,
you get used to it.

16:48.547 --> 16:51.130
Wait. Keenan said no?

16:51.130 --> 16:54.255
To us?
I guess you can never
really know someone

16:54.255 --> 16:57.714
until you ask them
to put their money
where their mouth is.

16:57.714 --> 17:00.589
You know,
kind of a shitty thing to do.

17:00.589 --> 17:02.381
Kind of a shitty
little dude.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.714
Anyway, well,
lesson learned.

17:05.714 --> 17:08.631
Anyhoo, as soon
as Erlich comes in

17:08.631 --> 17:12.089
and brings us our signed
data storage contract

17:12.089 --> 17:14.756
from Keenan, we'll be all set.
We'll be back in business.

17:14.756 --> 17:16.923
Huh? Go team.
Let's celebrate.

17:16.923 --> 17:18.881
Let's-- let's put on some music.
We never do that.

17:18.881 --> 17:20.923
What was the number?

17:20.923 --> 17:23.130
What number?
Your counteroffer
to Keenan.

17:23.130 --> 17:24.839
What was the number
you went back to him with?

17:24.839 --> 17:27.964
Well, Gilfoyle,
to be honest, these deals
are pretty complicated.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.798
Richard, what was
the number?

17:30.798 --> 17:33.589
Twenty-five million
fucking dollars.

17:33.589 --> 17:35.756
Wait. What?

17:35.756 --> 17:37.798
You heard
the man-child right.

17:37.798 --> 17:41.214
Richie had the quail eggs
to counter 25 million.

17:41.214 --> 17:42.297
Isn't that right, Richard?

17:42.297 --> 17:44.714
What?
That's fucking crazy.

17:44.714 --> 17:46.130
Yeah, I thought so too,

17:46.130 --> 17:48.130
but you know what's
even crazier than that?

17:50.255 --> 17:52.631
You guys got yourself
a fucking deal!

17:52.631 --> 17:54.506
What?

17:56.589 --> 17:59.089
Okay, so this
is $25 million?
This is real?

17:59.089 --> 18:01.923
As crystal.
Yeah, I'm--
I'm not gonna lie,

18:01.923 --> 18:03.798
when you first
told me that number,

18:03.798 --> 18:05.756
I had a feeling of mad.

18:05.756 --> 18:08.923
But then I had lunch,
and after that I was
a little tired,

18:08.923 --> 18:10.839
but I mostly felt
pretty okay.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.547
And that's when it hit me.

18:12.547 --> 18:15.631
This is a guy who knows
how valuable he is!

18:15.631 --> 18:18.673
It got me to thinking
that perhaps I had undervalued
my own company,

18:18.673 --> 18:22.089
especially because now
I have this baller algorithm

18:22.089 --> 18:23.547
that's solving
all my latency issues.

18:23.547 --> 18:26.047
Well, my algorithm.
So, I called Big Cat here,

18:26.047 --> 18:27.839
and we slid
that new demo
over to Raviga.

18:27.839 --> 18:31.839
Ed Chen liked it so much,
he offered to triple
the Bream-Hall deal.

18:31.839 --> 18:34.839
But the Bream-Hall deal
is signed. It's done, right?

18:34.839 --> 18:39.881
Was done.
Enter the keyman,
the big cat.

18:39.881 --> 18:44.964
You see, if I quit Bream-Hall,
then Keenan is free to do
whatever he wants.

18:44.964 --> 18:47.839
You quit Bream-Hall?
Two hours ago.

18:47.839 --> 18:51.089
Ten minutes later, we were
in a handshake deal at Raviga.

18:51.089 --> 18:53.964
This adorable little wombat
made clear his intentions

18:53.964 --> 18:56.464
that he wants me
to be the new COO

18:56.464 --> 18:59.881
of his company, along with
a five percent stake.

18:59.881 --> 19:03.255
And now,
we can all work together
on this dope-ass shit

19:03.255 --> 19:05.547
and make a fuck-ton of money
while we're doing it!

19:05.547 --> 19:08.005
See? It always
works out.

19:08.005 --> 19:10.422
It does. Who's drinking?
To the palapa!
Yeah!

19:10.422 --> 19:12.464
Pour me one, Big Cat!

19:12.464 --> 19:14.130
Jared, there's
no pink glasses!

19:14.130 --> 19:17.881
Richard, I know you think
I'm a bullshit artist.

19:17.881 --> 19:19.881
It's okay.
I totally am.

19:19.881 --> 19:23.297
I have this gift
where I can make people do
whatever I want 'em to do,

19:23.297 --> 19:25.005
and they don't even realize
they're doing it.
Right.

19:25.005 --> 19:28.005
Richard, you have
the greatest technology
that I've ever seen.

19:28.005 --> 19:29.547
You can change
the fucking world.

19:29.547 --> 19:31.756
You just have to get
people excited about it.

19:31.756 --> 19:34.089
That's where I come in.
You and me together, bro?

19:34.089 --> 19:36.589
Look how strong this is.
Fucking forget about it.

19:36.589 --> 19:39.756
We're gonna be
fucking cutting class
and crushing ass.

19:39.756 --> 19:43.422
You really think
that you can get people
excited about Pied Piper?

19:43.422 --> 19:45.964
Richard,
that's what I do.

19:45.964 --> 19:48.839
You know you're doing it.
Oh, I can see it.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.381
He knows. The wheels
are already turning.
Well--

19:51.381 --> 19:53.130
Maybe.
Come on,
you're fucking doing it!

19:53.130 --> 19:55.255
Let's do it, buddy!
Let's fucking do it!
Okay. Yeah.

19:55.255 --> 19:57.714
Come on!
Well, okay.

19:57.714 --> 20:00.297
Jared, here we go.
Oh, I'm just gonna wait.

20:00.297 --> 20:02.422
Okay, here you are.
Yeah!

20:02.422 --> 20:04.714
Get out there!

20:07.589 --> 20:08.881
- Richard?
- Yeah.

20:08.881 --> 20:10.005
Are-- are we okay?

20:10.005 --> 20:12.547
Uh, no, Jared,
we're-- we're not okay.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.214
We're fucking rich.

20:31.547 --> 20:34.673
Sorry, it's a bit nutty
around here.

20:34.673 --> 20:37.547
Yeah.
Well, I just wanna say,

20:37.547 --> 20:41.339
how sorry I am
that Erlich flaked
on you guys.

20:41.339 --> 20:44.631
- Not your fault.
- Also...

20:44.631 --> 20:47.798
and I know
this might piss you off
to some degree,

20:47.798 --> 20:50.631
I have decided to make a deal
with Keenan Feldspar.

20:50.631 --> 20:52.255
What? Why?

20:52.255 --> 20:55.130
He made a...
really good offer.

20:55.130 --> 20:59.172
Lots of money, and...
he's got my back, so.

20:59.172 --> 21:01.464
Right, well,
it's not like him
to talk you into a deal

21:01.464 --> 21:03.381
and then just
totally fuck you over.

21:03.381 --> 21:07.214
Yeah. No.
Look, he's copped up
to all that.

21:07.214 --> 21:10.964
I mean, he was
very honest about the whole
Keenan vortex thing, so.

21:10.964 --> 21:12.923
Well, you don't think
his discussing the vortex

21:12.923 --> 21:15.130
is just a way of pulling you
into the vortex?

21:15.130 --> 21:16.964
No. Wh-why would he-- wh...

21:20.631 --> 21:21.839
Son of a bitch.

21:23.005 --> 21:24.005
Yeah.

21:25.839 --> 21:29.506
Okay, look, Richard,

21:29.506 --> 21:32.756
what I'm about to tell you
is a huge breach of ethics,

21:32.756 --> 21:35.673
but it's gonna save you
from making a big mistake.

21:35.673 --> 21:38.297
Keenan and Erlich's
little keyman game

21:38.297 --> 21:41.506
is the greatest thing
that happened to this firm.

21:41.506 --> 21:45.047
I'd like to hear why.
"A," no more Erlich.

21:45.047 --> 21:47.714
And if that weren't enough,
we get our $20 million back.

21:47.714 --> 21:51.714
But the biggest reason
is that we realized once
we took a look under the hood,

21:51.714 --> 21:53.547
Keenan's tech is dog shit.

21:53.547 --> 21:55.881
No. No, it's not dog shit.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.005
I thought so too,
but then I tried the demo,

21:58.005 --> 22:01.214
and it's pretty amazing.
There's this point
in the tavern,

22:01.214 --> 22:02.631
uh, where you meet
this barmaid,

22:02.631 --> 22:04.714
and you can look
wherever you want,

22:04.714 --> 22:06.130
however long you want.

22:06.130 --> 22:09.714
Yeah, well, um, look,
the demo is amazing...

22:09.714 --> 22:12.047
when you run it
on a $10,000 rig.

22:12.047 --> 22:13.923
But the future
of VR is mobile,

22:13.923 --> 22:16.255
and there's no phone on Earth
that could handle that demo,

22:16.255 --> 22:18.089
let alone
the full-bloated platform.

22:18.089 --> 22:21.089
Isn't that why
Keenan has acquired us?

22:21.089 --> 22:22.798
I mean, to help him
figure that out?

22:22.798 --> 22:24.923
No, he just wants you
to make the demo better

22:24.923 --> 22:27.255
so he can take as much money
off the table as he can.

22:27.255 --> 22:30.172
He'll walk away rich,
the company will crater,

22:30.172 --> 22:32.089
and you will
go down with it,

22:32.089 --> 22:33.964
and that would be
the end of Pied Piper.

22:33.964 --> 22:37.297
Richard, you have
to tell Keenan that you're
not gonna take this deal.

22:41.589 --> 22:43.422
Fuck. What do I do?

22:43.422 --> 22:46.631
How am I supposed
to tell the guys that I'm
taking away their payday?

22:46.631 --> 22:49.255
You don't understand.
Keenan had us pouring champagne

22:49.255 --> 22:51.255
all over each other like
a bunch of fucking douchebags.

22:51.255 --> 22:55.297
I honestly don't think
they even care that
the tech is shit.

22:55.297 --> 22:56.756
They just want
to go to Hawaii.

22:56.756 --> 23:00.005
Hawaii?
It's a metaphor
we've been using.

23:00.005 --> 23:03.714
We're pirates,
and our ship is sinking,

23:03.714 --> 23:05.297
and Keenan is Hawaii.

23:06.214 --> 23:08.464
This is what
you talk about all day?

23:08.464 --> 23:12.005
Look.
This deal was our only hope,

23:12.005 --> 23:15.214
and, with all due respect,
you run your own firm,

23:15.214 --> 23:18.589
and you're not exactly
chomping at the chance
to fund us, are you?

23:18.589 --> 23:20.214
Because you're
still theoretical.

23:20.214 --> 23:23.422
Look, I'll make you a promise.
If you can get all
of Melcher's data

23:23.422 --> 23:25.631
onto a stable network
of mobile devices

23:25.631 --> 23:27.464
and prove that this works,

23:27.464 --> 23:28.839
I will fund your "A" round.

23:28.839 --> 23:30.923
Really?
You have my word,

23:30.923 --> 23:32.964
but you have
to tell Keenan no deal.

23:59.547 --> 24:00.839
Uh, guys?

24:00.839 --> 24:03.005
Oh, he came
in the front this time.

24:03.005 --> 24:06.714
Oh.
So, we need to talk to you.

24:06.714 --> 24:08.839
You need to talk to me?

24:08.839 --> 24:10.714
You may want
to have a seat.

24:10.714 --> 24:12.464
Okay.

24:18.047 --> 24:20.005
Is that a new... sweater?

24:20.005 --> 24:22.714
Hey, Richard,
there's some bad news.

24:26.130 --> 24:29.506
Richard, right before Keenan
signed the Raviga deal,

24:29.506 --> 24:32.255
somebody else swooped in
and offered him

24:32.255 --> 24:34.714
an absurd amount
of money for his company,

24:34.714 --> 24:37.964
and he took it.
Really?

24:37.964 --> 24:40.339
So, Keenan sold
his company.

24:40.339 --> 24:42.089
Deal's off the table.

24:42.089 --> 24:44.089
We're not going to Hawaii.

24:44.089 --> 24:47.839
Oh... no.

24:47.839 --> 24:50.881
Oh no.

24:50.881 --> 24:54.255
Listen, Richard, we know
you fought really hard
for this deal.

24:54.255 --> 24:55.714
We will never
forget that.

24:55.714 --> 24:57.422
Yeah, I did,
and I would gladly fight

24:57.422 --> 24:59.673
for it and you guys again.

24:59.673 --> 25:02.881
Gosh damn.

25:04.339 --> 25:05.923
Argh.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.798
You don't seem that mad.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.964
I am. I am, Gilfoyle.
I'm pissed.

25:10.964 --> 25:13.214
If-- if you need to kick
another hole in the door,

25:13.214 --> 25:15.673
we'd understand.
Oh yeah. No, I-- I might.

25:15.673 --> 25:17.422
I might have to.
Really, I just...

25:17.422 --> 25:19.589
If I don't calm down, I will.

25:19.589 --> 25:21.464
I will take you up on that.

25:21.464 --> 25:23.339
Who, uh...

25:23.339 --> 25:25.756
Who did he sell to?
The only other company

25:25.756 --> 25:29.506
that could guarantee viable
middle-out compression.

25:29.506 --> 25:30.923
- Hooli.
- Yup.

25:30.923 --> 25:32.547
Hooli.
He sold to Hooli.

25:34.047 --> 25:35.089
What a dick move.

25:35.089 --> 25:37.547
Yeah, I mean,
that's not the half of it.

25:37.547 --> 25:40.673
I mean, once he figured out
what Erlich's five percent
would be worth,

25:40.673 --> 25:42.089
he left him out in the cold.

25:44.089 --> 25:46.297
Wait. He-- he got Erlich
to quit his job

25:46.297 --> 25:48.297
and then cut him
out of the deal?

25:48.297 --> 25:50.005
Mm-hmm.
- Jesus.

25:50.005 --> 25:52.339
We thought you were cursed,
but maybe it was just

25:52.339 --> 25:53.964
your proximity to Erlich.

25:53.964 --> 25:56.130
I mean, that dude
must've driven a van

25:56.130 --> 25:58.631
over a bunch of gypsies
in a previous life.

25:59.964 --> 26:02.255
Where is he?
I saw him grab
his lighter

26:02.255 --> 26:05.297
and his bong and head out
to the palapa to sulk
a few minutes ago.

26:08.464 --> 26:10.172
Isn't that
his bong right there?

26:10.172 --> 26:11.631
Well, shit.

26:22.631 --> 26:23.964
Guys, there's a fire!

26:23.964 --> 26:25.631
We need the fire guys.

26:25.631 --> 26:26.798
Someone call
the fire guys!

26:28.297 --> 26:29.839
Erlich!

26:49.005 --> 26:50.589
Hey, buddy.

26:50.589 --> 26:52.547
Still not talking, huh?

26:52.547 --> 26:55.839
You've been out here
all night. It's freezing.

26:55.839 --> 26:58.130
You sure you don't wanna
come back inside?

27:04.714 --> 27:06.255
Yeah, it was
a nice palapa.

27:06.255 --> 27:10.756
Well, concrete's still
pretty warm from the fire.

27:10.756 --> 27:13.089
He should be okay
for at least a few more hours.

27:13.089 --> 27:15.381
Well, that's probably longer
than we'll be in business.

27:15.381 --> 27:18.923
Yeah, we got our first
past-due notice from Azure.

27:18.923 --> 27:21.506
