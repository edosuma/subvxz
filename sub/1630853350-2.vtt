00:00.251 --> 00:01.877
<i>Previously on</i> Bosch: Legacy.

00:01.961 --> 00:03.170
People versus Rogers.

00:03.254 --> 00:05.840
- The jury is hopelessly deadlocked.
- Shit.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.967
- You're going to retry him, right?
- We will weigh our options.

00:07.967 --> 00:10.052
How is this even a question?

00:10.136 --> 00:12.221
<i>Rogers hired a hitman
who killed four people,</i>

00:12.221 --> 00:14.682
<i>including a judge,
shot me twice and left me for dead.</i>

00:14.682 --> 00:17.727
- I understand how you feel.
- You have no Goddamn idea how I feel.

00:17.727 --> 00:19.019
What can I do for you, Mr. Vance?

00:19.103 --> 00:21.522
I was hoping you could bring
an old man some peace.

00:21.522 --> 00:25.568
I have no wife, no children
that I know of, no one to leave this to.

00:25.568 --> 00:29.822
There's billions at stake here
and people will do anything to stop you.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.741
Trying to get a hold
of a death certificate.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.826
- Name?
- Vibiana Duarte.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.619
- How did she die?
- Suicide.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.830
I'd like to try and find her child.
Your child.

00:37.830 --> 00:41.208
<i>You heard about Dr. Basu?
Yeah, he was a hero.</i>

00:41.292 --> 00:43.377
He devoted hisself
to the unhoused community.

00:43.461 --> 00:45.963
I gather there's already been an arrest.

00:45.963 --> 00:46.964
Yeah, a homeless man.

00:46.964 --> 00:50.676
Jeffrey, did you tell the detective
that you attacked the doctor?

00:50.760 --> 00:51.761
I wanna go home.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.763
Would you call what you've just seen
a cooked confession?

00:53.763 --> 00:54.722
One hundred percent.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.517
And in your expert opinion, what is
a proper interrogation supposed to be?

00:58.601 --> 01:00.019
A search for the truth.

01:17.036 --> 01:19.413
Cameras, every corner of the house.

01:20.915 --> 01:23.709
Motion detectors, spotlights...

01:23.793 --> 01:25.753
On the bright side, no dogs.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.213
Can you disarm the system?

01:27.213 --> 01:29.673
Man, can Sonny Rollins improvise?

01:29.757 --> 01:31.842
How long to bug the cars?

01:31.926 --> 01:33.219
How many he got?

01:33.219 --> 01:34.762
Two, according to the DMV.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.430
Hmm...

01:36.514 --> 01:37.640
Fifteen, tops.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.350
If they're parked in the driveway.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.477
If they're in the garage?

01:42.520 --> 01:43.521
Thirty.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.273
I'm your first call from jail.

01:47.733 --> 01:48.734
Well, look who's home.

01:50.528 --> 01:52.530
Rogers and his plus one.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.657
Dude, that's the new McLaren GT.

01:54.657 --> 01:57.451
Yo, that shit runs
between 250, 300K.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.453
What's that car do, fly?

01:59.537 --> 02:00.496
Everything but.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.542
And hello, Jasmine.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.544
Uh-oh. Fido.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.128
Plan B?

02:08.212 --> 02:10.881
Tail him wherever he goes.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.425
When the moment's right, bug the cars.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.595
Mercedes's a cinch, but McLaren's
gonna require a little bit of research.

02:16.679 --> 02:17.930
Takes what it takes.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.349
I thought this guy was urgent.

02:21.725 --> 02:22.977
This is just the beginning.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.232
Are you sleeping?

02:30.150 --> 02:30.985
Not great.

02:30.985 --> 02:35.573
I wake up about 3:00 or 4:00 every morning
and can't go back to sleep, so...

02:36.615 --> 02:38.826
The Ambien's not working that well.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.704
The Ativan?

02:41.704 --> 02:45.082
Yeah, it's effective for the most part.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.208
Keeps that, uh...

02:47.877 --> 02:51.505
...you know,
that crazy, panicky feeling at bay.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.092
How's the drinking?

02:56.927 --> 02:58.554
Yeah, I know. Um...

02:58.554 --> 03:01.307
You know, that's...
That's not really my thing.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.517
It's, uh, it's under control.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.103
And work?

03:06.103 --> 03:07.396
Work.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.026
Work keeps my mind off other things.

03:14.278 --> 03:15.112
Like what?

03:17.990 --> 03:18.908
Carl Rogers.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.079
Say more.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.505
What I...

03:33.589 --> 03:35.424
What I think about all the time...

03:39.345 --> 03:40.679
What I really want...

03:44.183 --> 03:49.605
...is to personally hunt him down
and fucking end him.

03:53.692 --> 03:54.526
What's stopping you?

03:59.657 --> 04:00.950
Civilization.

04:04.036 --> 04:08.165
<i>♪ Oh, my, my, times are changin' ♪</i>

04:08.165 --> 04:10.125
<i>♪ There's a fine, new day comin' round ♪</i>

04:10.209 --> 04:12.336
<i>♪ It's a feelin' like
a cool rain comin' down ♪</i>

04:12.336 --> 04:14.630
<i>♪ It's the rhythm of a new song singin' ♪</i>

04:14.630 --> 04:16.757
<i>♪ It's the rhythm
of a new song singin' ♪</i>

04:16.757 --> 04:21.095
<i>♪ Oh, my, my, times are changin' ♪</i>

04:21.095 --> 04:25.766
<i>♪ Oh, my, my,

04:25.766 --> 04:30.562

04:30.646 --> 04:34.400

04:58.465 --> 05:03.095
<i>♪ Oh, my, my, times are changin' ♪</i>

05:05.097 --> 05:07.641
The civil case
should keep Rogers distracted.

05:07.725 --> 05:09.935
Just to be clear,
I don't work for you.

05:10.019 --> 05:10.936
Understood.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.938
I need to see the Franzen deposition video

05:13.022 --> 05:16.025
so I can see why Willy Datz
changed his testimony.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.861
Mm. It's a shame you don't work for me.

05:18.861 --> 05:24.283
Client confidentiality extends postmortem
so I can't share the video with you.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.996
Worst thing about
moving to a boutique firm like this?

05:28.996 --> 05:31.457
I have to brew my own coffee.
Takes forever.

05:31.457 --> 05:32.916
First World problem.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.043
Absolutely.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.336
Care for a cup?

05:36.420 --> 05:37.921
Yes, please. Black.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.759
Make yourself comfortable.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.649
It was just a scare.
They've already sent Mr. Vance home.

05:57.775 --> 05:58.984
What was wrong with him?

05:59.068 --> 06:03.655
Fainted. Dehydrated. Electrolytes.
Potassium deficiency.

06:03.739 --> 06:07.117
Old fool should drink a Gatorade
and eat a banana.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.079
Why the fuck we hire
a private investigator? Blackmail?

06:10.079 --> 06:11.497
About what?

06:11.497 --> 06:13.248
There's always been those rumors
about Whitney Vance.

06:13.332 --> 06:15.209
No kids, lifelong bachelor...

06:15.209 --> 06:20.047
The man's 88 years old, for Christ's sake.
Even if they were true, why would he care?

06:20.047 --> 06:23.550
I've spoken with my sources at the Times,
the news stations,

06:23.634 --> 06:24.968
nobody's approached them.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.303
Lawsuit about to drop?

06:26.303 --> 06:29.014
If there is,
his attorneys haven't heard about it.

06:29.098 --> 06:30.224
What about an heir?

06:30.224 --> 06:32.267
One, there is no heir.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.728
Two, he's chosen you
to succeed him as CEO.

06:34.812 --> 06:40.359
Yeah, what if this detective digs one up?
Some, uh, pretender, right?

06:40.359 --> 06:43.112
An heir has a board seat,
controlling interest of the company.

06:43.112 --> 06:44.530
Look, you might as well resign yourself.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.615
As soon as the old man croaks,

06:46.615 --> 06:49.701
long-lost children of Whitney Vance
will crawl out of the woodwork,

06:49.785 --> 06:50.953
and the litigation will commence.

06:50.953 --> 06:51.870
It's inevitable.

06:51.954 --> 06:54.289
Could royally fuck my succession.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.667
Which is why you have
a flotilla of attorneys.

06:57.876 --> 06:58.710
In the meantime?

06:58.794 --> 07:02.131
Meantime, my people are on Bosch.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.309
Mr. Corwin.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.769
<i>How are you
and the staff doing?</i>

07:15.853 --> 07:17.354
Right as rain, thank you.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.355
<i>And Ida?</i>

07:18.355 --> 07:20.899
Quite a shock,
but she's back on the job.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.609
And how's Mr. Vance this morning?

07:22.693 --> 07:24.570
<i>Happy to be home
and resting comfortably.</i>

07:24.570 --> 07:26.113
How can I help you, sir?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.614
<i>Harry Bosch.</i>

07:27.698 --> 07:29.116
What about him?

07:29.116 --> 07:32.369
Why would Mr. Vance
hire a private detective?

07:32.369 --> 07:33.287
<i>No idea.</i>

07:33.287 --> 07:34.496
None of my business.

07:34.580 --> 07:37.166
<i>It Whitney's in some kind of trouble,
I hope you know we're here for him.</i>

07:37.166 --> 07:40.002
We have enormous resources
at our fingertips.

07:40.002 --> 07:42.212
I'll bear that in mind.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.339
<i>I'm gonna text you my cell.</i>

07:44.423 --> 07:47.968
If you need anything, anything at all,
David, I want you to reach out.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.013
I appreciate that.

07:56.768 --> 08:00.397
<i>Carl Rogers
mostly makes his nut on Wall Street,</i>

08:00.397 --> 08:03.901
<i>and then opens it up
to small fry like me.</i>

08:03.901 --> 08:09.740
<i>But the buy-in on this scheme
was too rich for my blood</i>

08:09.740 --> 08:15.829
<i>and Rogers had some
really unsavory actors in the mix.</i>

08:15.913 --> 08:17.539
<i>Unsavory in what way?</i>

08:17.623 --> 08:20.042
<i>In the Bratva way.</i>

08:20.042 --> 08:21.960
<i>Russian mafia.</i>

08:22.044 --> 08:23.837
<i>Da. Mafiya.</i>

08:27.549 --> 08:31.053
<i>Call Rogers mostly makes
his nut on Wall Street,</i>

08:31.053 --> 08:34.514
<i>and then opens it up
to small fry like me.</i>

08:44.191 --> 08:47.027
So, uh, anything strike you?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.072
Bratva strikes me.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.157
Ah, more Franzen bullshit.

08:52.241 --> 08:55.285
The D.A. couldn't find any linkage
between Rogers and Wall Street,

08:55.369 --> 08:56.662
much less the Russian mafia.

08:56.662 --> 09:01.875
"Carl Rogers makes
most of his nut on Wall Street."

09:03.585 --> 09:05.963
You think maybe he meant
Wall Street here in Los Angeles?

09:05.963 --> 09:06.922
The Fashion District?

09:06.922 --> 09:07.881
It's mobbed up.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.302
Huh. Never even occurred to me.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.345
Call it a hunch.

09:13.345 --> 09:16.807
Let's say I take a run downtown,
see if anything shakes out.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.520
Last thing.
Robbery's looking for

09:21.520 --> 09:25.399
a recidivist follow-home bandit
named Lavell Brown.

09:25.399 --> 09:29.111
Mr. Brown tails people home
from banks and ATMs

09:29.111 --> 09:31.947
and robs them at knifepoint.

09:31.947 --> 09:36.243
We wanna get this asshole
before he draws blood.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.070
Bosch.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.947
<i>Anything?</i>

10:14.031 --> 10:16.116
Nothing pops. So far anyway.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.327
Well, not every hunch pays off.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.078
Gonna be out of pocket
rest of the day.

10:20.162 --> 10:21.872
Working a private case.

10:21.872 --> 10:24.541
<i>That's all right,
I have my own fish to fry.</i>

10:24.541 --> 10:25.542
The homeless guy.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.210
That's right. Jeffrey Herstadt.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.880
Whose DNA was found
under the victim's fingernails.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.214
How's that working out for you?

10:31.298 --> 10:32.549
I'm hanging up now.

10:32.549 --> 10:33.633
<i>Before you do...</i>

10:33.717 --> 10:36.887
Just circling back with you,
just one more time.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.139
How far are you willing to go on Rogers?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.308
Asked and answered. I'm all in.

10:43.852 --> 10:44.853
Oh, Bella's here.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.605
<i>- Tell her I said hey.</i>
- I will.

10:49.733 --> 10:50.817
Hi.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.486
Harry Bosch says hello.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.154
Well, say hi back.

10:57.949 --> 11:00.994
Yeah. I really miss your mom.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.289
I know you guys were really close.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.127
Hey, can I, uh,
can I get you anything?

11:09.211 --> 11:10.253
I'm fine.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.840
Okay, well, please have a seat.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.723
You must be so disappointed
with the way things turned out.

11:21.807 --> 11:25.811
I'm beyond disappointed. Furious.
Aren't you?

11:25.811 --> 11:29.856
Of course,
but what can we do about it?

11:29.940 --> 11:33.693
We can file a wrongful death case,
a survivor action on your behalf.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.072
I...

11:37.072 --> 11:39.491
I don't know if I want
to go through all that again.

11:40.700 --> 11:45.414
Part of me feels like
I should just let it go, move on.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.499
What's the point?

11:47.499 --> 11:51.628
The point is,
Rogers pays a price for what he did to us.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.630
He had your mother killed, had me shot.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.761
Why would the result
be any different this time?

11:59.845 --> 12:01.847
Okay, couple of things.

12:02.848 --> 12:06.059
This is civil, not criminal.
The burden of proof is much lower.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.978
No "beyond a reasonable doubt."

12:10.230 --> 12:11.064
The other reason?

12:11.148 --> 12:13.024
I'm driving the case.

12:14.776 --> 12:19.906
Bella, it's some measure of justice
for you, me, and your mother.

12:21.950 --> 12:22.784
All right.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.579
Sign me up.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.290
The decision whether to try
the Rogers case a second time

12:28.290 --> 12:29.458
was not an easy one.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.669
Given the hung jury
and the issues with Datz's testimony--

12:32.669 --> 12:35.505
Yeah, well, a heads-up before
the news conference would have been nice.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.590
Sorry.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.927
Have you talked to the U.S. Attorney?
Maybe there's a RICO case to be made.

12:41.011 --> 12:44.556
I'm moving ahead with the civil case.
On behalf of Judge Sobel's daughter.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.683
- She's on board?
- One hundred percent.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.101
Great. Glad to hear it.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.020
I will need your case file.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.606
Well, submit a PRA request.
We'll work with you.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.149
The entire case file, Emmitt.

12:54.149 --> 12:57.110
You don't get to decide, piecemeal,
what to share or not share.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.071
I only have to give you documents
generated by my office.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.782
I also want the police reports
and anything from the coroner.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.701
I'll take it under advisement.

13:04.701 --> 13:05.660
Take it anywhere you want.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.747
Just send me the whole enchilada
by the end of the week.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.515
<i>Unattended vehicles
are subject to immediate towaway.</i>

13:30.769 --> 13:32.521
So, how was the flight?

13:34.105 --> 13:36.608
Thirteen hours. I'm starving.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.444
I know a place.

13:39.528 --> 13:44.533
Nothing fancy.
Steak. Vodka. Pretty girl.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.493
Just one?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.787
I told you. Thirteen-hour flight.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.206
So what's the story?

14:12.561 --> 14:14.354
Carl Rogers.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.108
So great to see you, brother.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.115
We make some noise.

14:46.261 --> 14:49.598
Dang, all this plastic.

14:49.598 --> 14:53.101
Aerodynamics, man.
You wouldn't wanna hit 220 without it.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.227
Fucker'd be airborne.

14:54.311 --> 14:57.814
Yeah, that's why I keep my Leaf
under two at all times. One-seventy, tops.

14:57.814 --> 14:58.857
Yeah, right.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.025
What are you looking for?

15:00.025 --> 15:02.652
A spot on the frame
to stick this magnet.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.614
Somewhere it won't fall off when
this baby hits a speed bump or a pothole.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.657
How about up there?

15:14.205 --> 15:15.040
What do you know.

15:17.459 --> 15:18.585
Magnet, my ass.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.425
Oh.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.935
"Vibiana Duarte. Seventeen."

15:36.019 --> 15:37.479
You know the location of her death?

15:37.479 --> 15:40.023
St. Helen's Home for Unwed Mothers.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.483
You know for sure she had the baby?

15:41.483 --> 15:42.776
That's what I'm trying to find out.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.321
We wouldn't have any birth records
that mention St. Helen's.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.614
Why not?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.282
Privacy laws regarding adoptions.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.745
If a child's born there, what do they do?

15:53.745 --> 15:55.872
List it as a home birth.

15:55.872 --> 15:56.998
Ah, I see. Okay.

15:58.750 --> 16:04.047
Please pull all home birth records
from January, February 1953.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.466
That would be hundreds of records.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.718
And I'll look through every one of 'em.

16:08.802 --> 16:12.597
Hope your eyes are good.
That's a shitload of microfiche.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.766
If I need a lot of copies,
what's that gonna run me?

16:14.766 --> 16:16.893
Thirty dollars a pop. Cash only.

16:16.893 --> 16:17.811
Since when?

16:17.811 --> 16:20.105
Since you quit the department, sweetie.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.983
Okay. Well, I need 'em. Thanks.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.944
All right, I'm up on
the girlfriend's Instagram. Twitter too.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.070
<i>What about Rogers?</i>

17:09.154 --> 17:12.198
Man, he's like you.
He don't do no social media.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.825
<i>Surveillance packages?</i>

17:13.825 --> 17:15.410
Prepping 'em as we speak.

17:15.410 --> 17:19.122
Don't forget to scratch off
the ID number on the SIM card.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.040
<i>Come on, man, way ahead of you.</i>

17:21.124 --> 17:22.876
Fake IP address, fake email.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.462
There's no way these bad boys
are leading back to us.

17:25.462 --> 17:26.963
<i>What are you listening to?</i>

17:26.963 --> 17:30.550
Oh. Christian Scott.
"Litany Against Fear."

17:30.550 --> 17:32.218
<i>Sounds ominous.</i>

17:32.302 --> 17:33.887
Pumps me up.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.180
Hurts my teeth.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.476
Dr. Basu was stabbed five times
under the right armpit.

17:40.685 --> 17:44.063
Vital blood vessels
leading directly to and from the heart.

17:44.147 --> 17:44.981
Would've been a ton of blood.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.610
He went into hemorrhagic shock
and bled out.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.404
Give me the EMT report on Basu.

17:56.826 --> 17:57.869
Mm.

17:57.869 --> 18:03.666
"Massive blood loss.
Unresponsive. No pulse."

18:08.338 --> 18:11.341
Hand me the Herstadt incident report.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.229
Come with me.

18:27.899 --> 18:28.775
<i>What about Pink's?</i>

18:28.775 --> 18:30.777
Hot dogs?

18:30.777 --> 18:33.029
And turkey dogs and burgers.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.198
Umami's got great burgers.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.283
Not on my watch.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.661
Bougie bullshit.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.793
I think I know those knuckleheads.
Let's stop 'em.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.378
For what?

18:48.378 --> 18:51.047
Dope. Guns. Warrants.
Unpaid tickets. Whatever.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.342
- What's our PC?
- Fuck you, bitch.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.260
Jaywalking.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.177
Jaywalking?

18:56.261 --> 18:58.304
Proactive policing, buttercup.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.473
Seriously?

19:03.226 --> 19:05.061
Spread your legs.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.896
Spread 'em.

19:06.980 --> 19:07.939
Now interlace your fingers.

19:09.023 --> 19:09.983
Shit's harassment.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.526
Pat him down.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.403
- What's this about, Officer?
- Turn and face the wall.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.113
No problem.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.531
Bullshit.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.366
Interlace your fingers
or we're gonna handcuff you.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.909
- Come on.
- Fuck you, Vasquez.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.452
I'm not gonna say it again.

19:21.536 --> 19:22.620
I don't have to do shit, bitch.

19:22.704 --> 19:23.913
Cuff him.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.293
This is some fucked up shit, yo.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.544
For your safety and ours.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.754
Spread your legs. Spread 'em.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.511
Pat me to the left, baby,
I'll feel safer.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.430
- Shut your mouth.
- I got something.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.640
- Well, well.
- I ain't carrying.

19:46.060 --> 19:46.895
Told ya.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.814
How about you, hmm?

19:51.524 --> 19:52.859
- I'm clean!
- Motherfucker!

19:52.859 --> 19:54.152
Stop where you are, asshole!

19:54.152 --> 19:56.112
Oh, shit! Run, bro, run!

19:56.112 --> 19:57.697
On your fucking knees!

19:57.697 --> 19:59.032
Stay the fuck here!

20:26.476 --> 20:28.144
Son of a bitch.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.239
What now?

20:42.784 --> 20:44.410
Worry about him later.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.373
We don't know why he ran.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.749
Well, he probably had a warrant.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.875
And if not that, what?

20:50.959 --> 20:54.504
We got him on a traffic ticket?
A one-forty-eight?

20:54.504 --> 20:56.589
Watch Commander's
not gonna sign off on that shit.

21:00.843 --> 21:01.928
Where's your guy?

21:06.265 --> 21:07.809
Shit.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.774
You left him on the sidewalk?

21:14.774 --> 21:15.692
Oh...

21:17.902 --> 21:19.195
Not supposed to leave my partner.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.072
Not supposed to leave
your suspect either, boot.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.532
Why didn't you throw him
in the back of the orca?

21:22.532 --> 21:23.783
I screwed up.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.411
You think?
He's wearing your cuffs.

21:26.411 --> 21:29.205
Fuck. My dad gave me those cuffs.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.082
And your serial number's on them.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.083
Homeboy gets caught with those cuffs,

21:32.083 --> 21:34.210
you'll take shit for this caper
for the rest of your career.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.879
Oh, this is gonna be
my second write-up in a week.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.881
Motherfucker ran on us
and you're worried about your probation?

21:38.965 --> 21:41.759
We're gonna find that pendejo
and arrest him.

21:41.843 --> 21:43.386
We don't know who he is.

21:43.386 --> 21:44.303
Check his cell.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.141
It's locked.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.519
He's got an address book?

21:53.187 --> 21:54.772
They give 'em to prisoners in County.

21:56.399 --> 21:57.567
No names. Just numbers.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.694
For people
he doesn't want listed in his phone.

22:02.613 --> 22:03.656
"Property of Sneezy."

22:03.740 --> 22:04.615
Our first clue.

22:05.908 --> 22:06.743
How do we wanna do this?

22:06.743 --> 22:08.578
Who's "we"?

22:08.578 --> 22:10.705
Start calling. Figure it out.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.712
I love your nail color.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.298
Thank you. I like the gel.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.594
Can't decide between these two.
What do you think?

22:25.928 --> 22:27.263
What's the occasion?

22:27.263 --> 22:30.016
Me and my boyfriend are going
to Santa Barbara for the weekend.

22:30.016 --> 22:30.933
Nice.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.352
The Ranch at San Ysidro.

22:34.562 --> 22:35.938
Very nice.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.942
I'd go with the darker one,
but that's just me.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.070
What's your occasion?

22:42.070 --> 22:45.156
A homecoming.
He's been out of town.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.033
Going someplace special?

22:47.033 --> 22:48.367
Republique.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.870
Love that place. Have fun.

22:50.870 --> 22:51.788
You too.

23:03.216 --> 23:04.133
<i>Bosch.</i>

23:04.217 --> 23:05.134
Republique. Tonight.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.934
Hi. Um, I'm looking
for one of your friends.

23:14.018 --> 23:14.852
Sneezy?

23:17.021 --> 23:17.855
Hello? Hello?

23:17.939 --> 23:23.486
About five-nine. Skinny. You know, Sneezy.

23:23.486 --> 23:24.946
How many Sneezys do you know?

23:24.946 --> 23:28.157
We wanna mail him his check.
He owes you money?

23:28.241 --> 23:31.410
Ma'am, please don't scream at me.
I didn't sleep with him.

23:31.494 --> 23:36.249
Yeah, his aunt's been in a car accident.
Yeah, that's right, Auntie G.

23:36.249 --> 23:39.335
Um, so they took her
to the hospital, but...

23:41.629 --> 23:46.467
No, no, it's not serious.
It's just a... precaution.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.094
But I need to tell him.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.058
You know where he lives?

23:58.646 --> 24:01.858
That is super helpful, thank you.

24:04.569 --> 24:07.321
That was his ex.
I got a name and an address.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.792
Hi. I'm looking for a paramedic
named Albert Morales.

24:19.876 --> 24:20.710
Is he here today?

24:20.710 --> 24:22.086
Who wants to see him?

24:22.170 --> 24:23.379
He doesn't know me.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.382
I'm passing on a thank you
from someone he took care of on a call.

24:26.382 --> 24:27.550
I can give it to him.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.802
It comes with a story I need to tell him.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.263
Yeah, give me a sec.

24:40.188 --> 24:41.606
Wanted to see me?

24:41.606 --> 24:43.399
Albert Morales, Rescue Two-Seven?

24:43.399 --> 24:44.400
Yeah, that's right.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.527
I have something for you. Matthew.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.072
- What's this?
- A subpoena.

24:50.156 --> 24:55.119
Signed by Judge Baker. You need to be
in court tomorrow at 9:00 sharp.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.287
Please read the details.

24:56.287 --> 24:57.413
Fuck me.

24:58.414 --> 24:59.290
What case is this?

24:59.290 --> 25:00.416
Jeffrey Herstadt.

25:00.416 --> 25:03.544
You treated him for seizure
at Caffé Etc. in Hollywood.

25:04.545 --> 25:05.671
The guy that killed the doctor?

25:05.755 --> 25:07.131
Allegedly.

25:07.215 --> 25:10.426
It says you need to bring
any documentation you have on the call

25:10.426 --> 25:11.677
and your rescue kit.

25:11.761 --> 25:14.222
My kit? What the fuck for?

25:14.222 --> 25:15.473
You'll find that out tomorrow.

25:15.473 --> 25:16.849
You've been served.

25:17.892 --> 25:18.726
See you in the morning.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.369
When are we meeting
with this fucking guy?

25:37.536 --> 25:38.412
I'm handling it.

25:39.664 --> 25:40.957
I didn't come here to wait around.

25:45.127 --> 25:47.004
In the meantime,
maybe you help me fix something else.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.471
Hello, ma'am, is Roberto here?

25:55.471 --> 25:56.555
What's this about?

25:56.639 --> 25:58.349
We need to talk to him about his parole.

26:11.862 --> 26:12.863
Thought you could run from me?

26:12.947 --> 26:13.990
The fuck?

26:13.990 --> 26:16.742
Get up. Now. On your feet. Let's go.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.911
What am I being arrested for?

26:18.995 --> 26:20.538
Running from the police.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.207
What'd you do with her cuffs?

26:26.002 --> 26:27.962
Got 'em.

26:29.755 --> 26:30.589
They're hers.

26:40.933 --> 26:41.767
I'm gonna let you walk.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.688
But you run your mouth about this,
I will hunt you down.

26:45.688 --> 26:46.647
Understand?

26:47.857 --> 26:49.775
Go. Get the fuck out of here.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.532
You're letting him go.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.659
If I arrest him,
I have to report this whole shit show.

27:01.620 --> 27:05.458
So I, um, guess this means
you're not writing me up.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.544
I'm going out
on a limb here for you, Bosch.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.547
You shouldn't have left him
on the sidewalk.

27:11.547 --> 27:12.923
But you had my back.

27:14.091 --> 27:14.925
I won't let you down.

27:15.009 --> 27:17.928
Jesus, boot.
Don't ever say that.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.771
Yeah?

27:26.771 --> 27:28.939
Hey, come in.

27:29.023 --> 27:33.986
Man. Oh, sorry I'm late.
No place to park.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.654
Yeah. Tell me about it.

27:35.738 --> 27:39.575
Ever since traffic has gone back
to, quote, unquote, "normal."

27:39.575 --> 27:41.786
Yeah, it's the one good thing
about the pandemic.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.287
At least you can find a parking space.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.415
Thanks for stopping by.
Coffee? Just made.

27:46.499 --> 27:47.333
Oh, no, thanks.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.668
Nice digs.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.505
You living here?

27:52.505 --> 27:56.050
Yeah, time being.
They red-tagged my house.

27:56.050 --> 28:01.514
Ah. Well, Rogers' visitor log,
phone records.

28:01.514 --> 28:02.848
Some audio files too.

28:02.932 --> 28:03.766
Thanks.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.601
But here's some intel that's not in there.

28:05.601 --> 28:08.437
While he was cooling his heels in County
awaiting trial,

28:08.521 --> 28:11.148
our boy Rogers bought himself
some big-time protection.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.234
How big-time?

28:13.234 --> 28:16.404
Round the clock.
Never even got his hair mussed.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.240
Thanks.

28:19.240 --> 28:23.744
Yeah. Well, I'd say anytime,
but that isn't true.

28:23.828 --> 28:26.288
Yeah. I get it.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.376
You miss it?

28:32.837 --> 28:33.671
A little bit.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.727
Thank you.

28:50.855 --> 28:51.689
Take good care of her.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.023
My pleasure.

29:08.664 --> 29:09.498
My man.

29:15.588 --> 29:19.049
"Maternity home marks 100th anniversary."

29:24.805 --> 29:26.015
Abigail Turnbull.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.268
Abigail Turnbull.

29:32.855 --> 29:33.772
Worth a try?

29:36.317 --> 29:37.568
What do you think, boy?

29:39.445 --> 29:40.654
Yeah, worth a try.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.742
<i>Literally the best tiramisu ever.</i>

29:44.742 --> 29:46.911
<i>And I've had a lot of tiramisu.</i>

29:46.911 --> 29:49.705
Cat's in the bag. Bag's in the river.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.624
<i>Audio too?</i>

29:51.624 --> 29:53.626
Girlfriend digs the tiramisu.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.419
Let me know
if he doesn't go straight home.

29:55.503 --> 29:56.337
<i>Copy that.</i>

30:28.577 --> 30:29.411
Hey, boy.

30:31.163 --> 30:31.997
How you doing?

30:33.207 --> 30:34.041
Good morning.

30:44.468 --> 30:45.844
I'll be with you in a minute, pal.

31:29.888 --> 31:30.723
Go.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.360
- Clear?
- Hold on.

31:44.612 --> 31:45.446
We're good.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.033
When you gonna
put me in again, Coach?

31:49.033 --> 31:50.159
I could use the dough.

31:50.159 --> 31:53.662
When I need you. Right now
what I need is to borrow your car.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.331
I get it back by tomorrow.

31:55.331 --> 31:56.832
I just booked a role.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.500
Oh, yeah, what's the part?

31:58.584 --> 32:00.586
Waitress. Three lines.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.838
Look at you, showtime.

32:02.838 --> 32:06.258
I know, sucks, right?
Think I should quit?

32:06.342 --> 32:10.262
Uh, I'm the last guy in the world
you wanna ask for career advice.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.642
Your Honor,
I'd like to mark for identification

32:14.642 --> 32:18.687
a copy of the Fire Department
incident report filed by Mr. Morales.

32:18.771 --> 32:22.149
It'll be marked as Defense Exhibit A.
Go ahead, Ms. Chandler.

32:27.404 --> 32:29.865
What is that document, Mr. Morales?

32:29.865 --> 32:34.161
It's the incident report I filled out
after treating Jeffrey Herstadt.

32:34.161 --> 32:35.871
Can you read the summary?

32:35.871 --> 32:39.333
"Subject fell or seized
on floor of business. All vitals good.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.876
Oxygen levels good.

32:40.876 --> 32:44.380
Refused treatment or transport
for minor head laceration from fall.

32:44.380 --> 32:45.631
Subject walked away."

32:45.631 --> 32:48.425
"All vitals good.
Oxygen levels good."

32:49.635 --> 32:51.053
How did you reach that conclusion?

32:51.053 --> 32:54.515
I measured his pulse,
I checked his blood pressure,

32:54.515 --> 32:56.266
and then I put an oximeter on his finger.

32:56.350 --> 32:58.477
And what does the oximeter do?

32:58.477 --> 33:00.813
It measures the oxygen content
in the blood.

33:01.855 --> 33:03.190
Can you show us the oximeter?

33:14.284 --> 33:16.203
Just clamp it on any finger?

33:16.203 --> 33:17.621
Index finger.

33:17.705 --> 33:20.207
How long did you treat
Jeffrey Herstadt that day?

33:21.208 --> 33:26.046
From beginning to end,
when he walked away,

33:26.130 --> 33:28.173
11 minutes.

33:28.257 --> 33:29.717
And then what did you do?

33:29.717 --> 33:33.387
Packed up, got a couple lattes,
and left.

33:33.387 --> 33:36.515
Did your crew receive
another emergency call

33:36.515 --> 33:38.684
soon after returning
to the station that night?

33:38.684 --> 33:40.811
- Yes.
- What was the call?

33:40.811 --> 33:42.938
A stabbing.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.774
The doctor that got stabbed. Dr. Basu.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.487
Okay, let's talk about that next.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.993
How soon after returning
from treating Mr. Herstadt

33:55.993 --> 33:57.953
did you get the stabbing call?

33:57.953 --> 34:01.915
The calls were one hour
and nine minutes apart.

34:01.999 --> 34:04.418
Was the victim, Dr. Basu,
alive when you got there?

34:06.253 --> 34:07.171
He was circling the drain.

34:07.171 --> 34:08.881
He was dying?

34:11.884 --> 34:13.510
He lost too much blood.

34:13.594 --> 34:16.805
He was unresponsive.
There was no pulse.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.182
There was nothing
we could really do for him.

34:18.182 --> 34:20.768
But you checked his vitals
despite the fact that,

34:20.768 --> 34:22.978
as you say,
"He was circling the drain"?

34:22.978 --> 34:25.481
It's protocol.
No matter what, you do that.

34:25.481 --> 34:26.899
- With the oximeter?
- Yes.

34:26.899 --> 34:30.569
Was that the same oximeter
used less than an hour earlier

34:30.569 --> 34:32.988
to check the vitals of Jeffrey Herstadt?

34:32.988 --> 34:34.615
It would have been, yes.

34:36.283 --> 34:39.411
And between the two calls,
where was the oximeter?

34:39.495 --> 34:41.079
In my kit.

34:41.163 --> 34:44.208
Did you clean or disinfect it
between these two calls?

34:47.169 --> 34:48.170
No.

34:48.170 --> 34:49.254
Sterilize it?

34:50.756 --> 34:51.590
No.

34:54.510 --> 34:58.680
Mr. Morales, do you know
what DNA transfer is?

34:58.764 --> 35:00.224
Objection. Uh...

35:00.224 --> 35:04.853
Mr. Morales is not a DNA expert
and can't testify on DNA transfer.

35:04.937 --> 35:08.065
I'll withdraw the question.
I have nothing further, Your Honor.

35:09.149 --> 35:09.983
Ms. Saldano?

35:13.028 --> 35:16.365
No questions, Your Honor.

35:16.365 --> 35:17.658
I think we should take a break.

35:17.658 --> 35:21.245
And during that break,
I invite Ms. Saldano and Ms. Chandler

35:21.245 --> 35:24.331
to my chambers
to discuss the viability of this case.

35:24.331 --> 35:25.249
Any objections?

35:25.249 --> 35:27.543
- No, Your Honor.
- No, Your Honor.

35:32.089 --> 35:34.258
Simon. How's it hanging?

35:34.258 --> 35:36.426
<i>Enjoying your freedom, I hope.</i>

35:37.928 --> 35:39.054
That, I am.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.682
<i>Our Stoli friend wants to meet.</i>

35:43.141 --> 35:44.476
Can you buy us some time?

35:44.560 --> 35:46.770
<i>Not an option.</i>

35:46.854 --> 35:48.063
<i>Well, he knows I'm good for it.</i>

35:48.063 --> 35:50.941
<i>Are you?
They sound impatient, Carl.</i>

35:50.941 --> 35:51.859
<i>They?</i>

35:51.859 --> 35:53.735
<i>The old man sent Lev.</i>

35:55.153 --> 35:57.406
<i>Carl? You still with me?</i>

35:57.406 --> 36:00.325
Just find out the where and when
and we'll be there.

36:03.871 --> 36:04.997
Mo.

36:05.122 --> 36:07.666
<i>Rogers just got off the phone
with a dude named Simon.</i>

36:07.666 --> 36:08.750
<i>They're setting up a meeting.</i>

36:08.834 --> 36:10.961
Simon Wakefield's his financial guy.

36:10.961 --> 36:12.629
Yeah, well,
they ain't dealing with no bank.

36:12.713 --> 36:15.507
This sounded urgent
and Rogers sounded concerned.

36:15.591 --> 36:16.675
<i>Anything else?</i>

36:16.675 --> 36:19.303
Yeah, the phone that he used in prison.

36:19.303 --> 36:22.514
<i>The number he most frequently called
was a burner.</i>

36:22.598 --> 36:24.266
So we don't know who he was calling.

36:24.266 --> 36:26.059
<i>I scored the serial number.</i>

36:26.143 --> 36:29.730
The burner was bought
from a gas station in Bakersfield.

36:29.730 --> 36:32.107
It's a Sokol Gas & Go.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.902
All right.
Call me when you got something more.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.113
Hi.

36:38.864 --> 36:39.865
Can I help you?

36:39.865 --> 36:42.451
Yes, I was wondering
if I could speak to Abigail Turnbull.

36:42.451 --> 36:45.120
Oh, she hasn't been here in many years.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.707
Oh. Is she no longer with us?

36:48.707 --> 36:51.293
Oh, she's still here. Retired.

36:51.418 --> 36:54.338
- Oh.
- Abby will outlive us all.

36:54.338 --> 36:57.007
I met her
at the hundredth-year anniversary party.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.675
My mother and I spoke to her then.

36:58.759 --> 37:01.762
Oh. I'm sorry. Who are you?

37:01.762 --> 37:04.473
Dale. I was born here.

37:04.473 --> 37:06.224
- You don't say.
- Yeah.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.977
Abigail was my mother's social worker.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.855
And my mom never forgot her.

37:11.939 --> 37:14.066
Well, what can I do for you, Dale?

37:15.776 --> 37:17.152
My mother just passed away.

37:17.152 --> 37:18.904
I'm so sorry.

37:18.904 --> 37:22.115
I have a message for Abigail from her,

37:22.199 --> 37:24.034
so I'm just trying to figure out
the best way to get it to her.

37:24.034 --> 37:27.079
Oh, send it here,
and I'll make sure she gets it.

37:27.079 --> 37:28.580
I think it'll take too long.

37:28.664 --> 37:31.750
I just wanted make sure she knew about
the service in case she wanted to attend.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.585
Oh. When are the services?

37:33.669 --> 37:34.503
Sunday.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.716
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.856
I can't give her phone number
without permission.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.234
But under the circumstances...

37:57.234 --> 38:00.529
If you put it in the mail today,
she should get it in time.

38:04.658 --> 38:06.994
Bless you.
You have a wonderful day.

38:07.995 --> 38:11.456
Based on our discussion, Your Honor,
the defense is making a motion to dismiss.

38:11.540 --> 38:12.833
People?

38:12.833 --> 38:16.378
Your Honor, based on discussions
with the court, counsel,

38:16.378 --> 38:21.008
and my supervisors,
regarding possible DNA transfer,

38:21.008 --> 38:23.343
the People are unable
to proceed at this time

38:23.427 --> 38:25.262
based on the insufficiency
of the evidence.

38:26.805 --> 38:31.810
The court is going to grant
the motion to dismiss pursuant to PC 1385.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.062
Court is now in recess.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.150
He didn't say I was innocent.

38:38.150 --> 38:41.111
Hey, this just means
that you're not facing a murder trial.

38:41.111 --> 38:43.905
We'll petition for factual innocence
and we'll get there.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.490
This is great news, Jeffrey.

38:45.574 --> 38:46.825
What now?

38:46.825 --> 38:49.411
You'll be processed out.
It'll just take a few hours.

38:50.829 --> 38:51.830
You're a free man.

38:54.291 --> 38:55.125
Thank you.

38:57.878 --> 38:59.212
You know, that kid is a menace.

38:59.296 --> 39:02.215
And whatever happens from here on out,
that's on you.

39:02.299 --> 39:04.009
And your investigator.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.052
He's not my investigator.

39:05.052 --> 39:06.595
Sure.

39:06.595 --> 39:08.013
You still think Herstadt did it?

39:08.013 --> 39:09.514
I fucking know he did.

39:09.598 --> 39:12.100
He needs to be locked up
for his own good and everyone else's.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.393
Excuse me, please.

39:13.477 --> 39:16.521
You tell Bosch good job.
He should be proud.

39:16.605 --> 39:19.566
He just undid everything
he ever did with a badge.

39:19.566 --> 39:21.943
Move, asshole.

39:35.332 --> 39:38.543
Ms. Turnbull.
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

39:38.627 --> 39:40.629
I was wondering if you could help me.

39:40.629 --> 39:41.880
What do you want?

39:41.880 --> 39:44.716
My name's Harry Bosch.
I'm a private investigator.

39:44.800 --> 39:48.470
I'd like to speak with you about a case
I'm working on. You mind if I come in?

39:51.431 --> 39:52.849
I have my credentials here.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.028
- May I sit?
- Go ahead.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.908
What's this about?

40:09.908 --> 40:12.452
Well, I read about you in the paper.

40:12.536 --> 40:14.246
St. Helen's.

40:14.246 --> 40:17.874
The story you told about your daughter
going there for answers and finding you.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.169
So...

40:21.253 --> 40:24.297
I work for someone.
An older gentleman.

40:24.381 --> 40:25.799
He's looking for answers too.

40:26.967 --> 40:28.510
His child was born at St. Helens,

40:28.510 --> 40:30.846
and I think you can help me
find his child.

40:30.846 --> 40:33.056
I was there for 50 years.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.350
There were hundreds of babies.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.102
I understand it was a long time ago.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.895
But I think you'd remember the name.

40:40.313 --> 40:41.523
Vibiana.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.067
Vibiana Duarte.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.738
You remember her, don't you?

40:50.198 --> 40:51.658
This man you work for.

40:53.702 --> 40:54.953
He abandoned her.

40:55.912 --> 40:56.788
And his son.

40:56.872 --> 40:59.416
He doesn't have much time left.

40:59.416 --> 41:01.585
Then he's better off not knowing.

41:02.878 --> 41:04.379
Not our call to make.

41:04.379 --> 41:05.547
Please.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.138
The boy was frail.

41:15.473 --> 41:20.312
We had a rule, no baby could go home
until it weighed at least five pounds.

41:22.147 --> 41:26.943
Vibby kept him in her room.
She fed him with her milk.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.198
How long?

41:33.200 --> 41:34.034
About a week or so.

41:36.620 --> 41:40.874
She got time with that baby
no one else ever got with theirs.

41:40.874 --> 41:43.460
Some people call that a blessing.

41:45.086 --> 41:46.796
But not you.

41:50.675 --> 41:54.429
She bonded with that child.
Of course she did.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.683
She was heartbroken
when they took him away.

42:01.645 --> 42:03.271
Losing her baby like that.

42:06.942 --> 42:09.110
She was so young.

42:13.615 --> 42:14.866
What happened to Vibiana?

42:19.496 --> 42:20.622
She used a clothesline.

42:22.582 --> 42:23.541
From the laundry.

42:26.544 --> 42:30.507
By the time anyone found her,
it was too late.

42:36.429 --> 42:37.264
And the boy?

42:39.307 --> 42:40.183
Adopted.

42:42.185 --> 42:43.645
Do you remember his name?

42:44.604 --> 42:46.314
Vibby called him Dominick.

42:48.692 --> 42:50.735
And what name
did the adoptive parents give him?

42:51.903 --> 42:54.614
They promised to call him Dominick too.

44:14.027 --> 44:15.403
Bathroom's on the other side.

44:15.487 --> 44:16.654
Cyrus, right?

44:20.784 --> 44:23.370
Alex. My brother Lev.

44:23.370 --> 44:25.497
And this is my office, guys.

44:25.497 --> 44:27.457
You work for Gurov.
Gurov works for us.

44:27.457 --> 44:30.001
So... this is our office.

44:30.085 --> 44:33.046
Well, you want him,
he stops by in the afternoons,

44:33.046 --> 44:34.589
you have to come back.

44:34.589 --> 44:35.715
Oh, he knows we're here.

44:37.384 --> 44:38.259
What is this?

44:38.343 --> 44:39.177
Housecleaning.

44:39.177 --> 44:42.847
We're visiting all our stations,
making sure all the numbers add up.

44:42.931 --> 44:45.600
Mm. Gurov can show you the books.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.852
I've seen them.
You're stealing from us.

44:47.936 --> 44:49.521
What are you talking about?

44:49.521 --> 44:50.814
Don't play dumb.

44:50.814 --> 44:52.565
Gurov gets his money.
Every penny.

44:54.317 --> 44:55.151
Maybe you talk to him.

44:55.235 --> 44:58.696
Come clean.
We work this out.

45:00.156 --> 45:01.241
Just don't lie to me.

45:02.325 --> 45:03.618
I swear.

45:03.618 --> 45:06.746
No! Please!
Please, man! I can't!

45:06.830 --> 45:10.834
Please! Please!
Just inside! Inside!

45:23.972 --> 45:25.640
I have a family!

45:25.640 --> 45:30.103
No! No! No!

46:35.168 --> 46:37.295
Dominick Santanello.
