00:02.400 --> 00:05.153
I'm always in traffic
with the lane expert.

00:05.320 --> 00:08.790
Do you know this type of person?
Constantly re-evaluating...

00:08.960 --> 00:10.996
...their lane choice.
Never quite sure:

00:12.520 --> 00:15.239
"Is this the best lane for me,
for my life?"

00:15.400 --> 00:17.994
They're always a little bit ahead.
"Can I get in over there?

00:18.160 --> 00:19.388
Can I get ahead of you?"

00:19.560 --> 00:22.279
Yeah, come on over here, pal.
We're zooming over here.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.874
This is the secret lane,
nobody knows about it.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.477
The ultimate... I think the ultimate
psychological test of traffic...

00:28.640 --> 00:31.154
...is the total dead stop.
Not even rolling...

00:31.320 --> 00:34.710
...and you look out the window,
you see gum clearly.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.911
But we know that in the future,
traffic will get even worse than that.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.277
What will happen? Will it start
moving backwards? Is that possible?

00:42.440 --> 00:47.036
That someday we'll be going, "Boy,
this is some really bad traffic now.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.749
This is really bad.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.913
I'm gonna try and get off,
and get back on going the other way."

00:59.720 --> 01:02.280
- She can't kill me, right?
- No, of course not.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.191
- People break up all the time.
- Every day.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.191
It just didn't work out.
What can I do?

01:06.360 --> 01:09.079
I wanted to love her.
I tried to love her. I couldn't.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.275
You tried.

01:10.440 --> 01:14.149
I'd be looking at her face, I'd go,
"Come on. Love her. Love her."

01:14.320 --> 01:16.356
- Did you tell her you loved her?
- I had no choice.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.750
She squeezed it out of me.

01:18.920 --> 01:22.196
She'd tell me she loved me. All right,
so at first, I'd just look at her.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.352
I'd go, "Oh, really?"

01:25.520 --> 01:28.990
Or, "Boy, that's...
That's something."

01:29.160 --> 01:31.355
But eventually,
you have to come back with:

01:31.520 --> 01:34.637
"Well, I love you." You know,
you can only hold out for so long.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.916
- You're a human being.
- I didn't even ask her out.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.275
She asked me out first.
She called me up.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.591
What was I supposed to do, say no?
I can't do that to someone.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.832
- You're too nice a guy.
- I am. I'm a nice guy.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.309
And then she seduced me.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.233
We're in my apartment,
I'm on the couch, she's on the chair.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.470
I get up to go to the bathroom,
I come back...

01:53.640 --> 01:54.914
...she's on the couch.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.435
What am I supposed to do?
Not do anything?

01:57.600 --> 01:59.158
I couldn't. I would've insulted her.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.517
- You're flesh and blood.
- I had nothing to do with any of this.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.636
I met all her friends.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.075
I didn't want to meet them.
I kept trying to avoid it.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.958
I knew it would only
get me in deeper.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.918
But they were everywhere. They
kept popping up all over the place.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.789
"This is Nancy, Susan, Amy,
my cousin, my brother, my father."

02:15.960 --> 02:18.713
- It's like I'm in quicksand here.
- I told you when I met her.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.075
My back is killing me.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.356
You gotta go to my chiropractor.
He's the best.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.318
- Everybody's guy is the best.
- I'll make an appointment for you.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.711
- We'll go together.
- Please, they don't do anything.

02:29.880 --> 02:33.350
Do I have to break up with her in
person? Can't I do it over the phone?

02:33.520 --> 02:36.398
- I have no stomach for these things.
- Do it like a Band-Aid.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.312
One motion, right off!

02:39.080 --> 02:41.674
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.716
- What are you doing?
- I'm letting you in.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.872
No, I don't want to sit in back.
I'll be left out of the conversation.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.712
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will, George.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.519
I'll have to stick my chin
on top of the seat.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.114
- Okay.
- Why can't you sit in the middle?

02:55.280 --> 02:58.590
Please. It doesn't look good.
Boy, boy, girl.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.671
I think you're afraid
to sit next to a man.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.274
You're a little homophobic,
aren't you?

03:03.440 --> 03:05.476
Is it that obvious?

03:06.080 --> 03:07.832
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.309
- Did you get a haircut?
- Nope. Shower.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.598
So where are we eating?

03:12.760 --> 03:15.558
Tell me if you think this is strange.
There's this guy...

03:15.720 --> 03:18.757
...who lives in my building who I was
introduced to a couple years ago.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.354
He's a teacher or something.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.637
Anyway, after we met, whenever
we'd run into each other in the street...

03:24.800 --> 03:26.313
...or in the lobby, or whatever...

03:26.480 --> 03:29.677
...we would stop and chat a little bit.
Nothing much. Little pleasantries.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.796
He's a nice guy. He's got a family.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.791
Then after a while,
I noticed there was...

03:33.960 --> 03:37.999
...no more stopping, just saying hello
and continuing on our way.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.751
And then the verbal hellos stopped...

03:40.920 --> 03:44.356
...and we just went into these
little sort of nods of recognition.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.115
So fine, I figure, that's where this
relationship is finally gonna settle.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.474
Polite nodding.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.031
Then one day...

03:52.200 --> 03:54.111
...he doesn't nod.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.679
Like I don't exist?

03:55.840 --> 03:57.796
He went from nods to nothing.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.950
Now there's this intense animosity
whenever we pass.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.998
I mean, it's like we really hate
each other. It's based on nothing.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.878
A relationship is an organism.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.758
You created this thing...

04:09.920 --> 04:13.151
...and then you starved it,
so it turned against you.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.072
Same thing happened in The Blob.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.357
I think you absolutely have to say
something to this guy. Confront him.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.509
- Really?
- Yes.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.592
- Would you do that?
- Lf I was a different person.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.113
Hello?

04:26.280 --> 04:28.157
Hello, is Glen there?

04:28.320 --> 04:32.313
I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?

04:32.480 --> 04:36.996
Yes, I know I have the wrong number.
I want to know if I dialled wrong or...

04:37.920 --> 04:40.036
Why do people do that?

04:45.480 --> 04:47.232
Come on up.

04:48.640 --> 04:49.834
Oh, it's you again. See?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.230
If you'd answered me,
I wouldn't have had to do this.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.870
That's two long-distance calls
I've made to you. Why can't you...?

04:56.040 --> 04:58.634
Why? Why do they just
hang up like that?

04:58.800 --> 05:00.756
Thank you very much.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.594
- Taste this.
- No, I just had a sandwich.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.671
- No, taste it.
- I don't want cantaloupe now.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.400
- You never had it like this before.
- I only eat cantaloupe...

05:11.560 --> 05:15.075
- Jerry, this is great cantaloupe.
- All right.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.551
- It's very good. It's good.
- It's good, huh?

05:19.720 --> 05:22.871
I got it at Joe's, 49 cents a pound.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.793
That's practically half than what
you pay at the supermarket.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.598
I don't know why
you don't go to Joe's.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.478
It's too far.

05:31.320 --> 05:34.357
It's three blocks further.
You could use my shopping cart.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.997
I'm not pulling a shopping cart.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.639
Am I supposed to wear a kerchief...

05:38.800 --> 05:40.631
...put stockings on
rolled below my knee?

05:40.800 --> 05:42.836
The other thing is,
if you don't like anything...

05:43.000 --> 05:45.912
...he takes it back.
- I don't return fruit.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.274
Fruit's a gamble.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.158
I know that going in.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.074

05:58.280 --> 05:59.759
I did it! It's over.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.514
- You did it? What happened?
- I told her, in the kitchen.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.877
Which was risky,
because it's near all the knives.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.120
I started with the word "listen."
I said:

06:09.680 --> 06:12.638
"Listen, Marlene." The next thing
I know, I'm in the middle of it.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.598
There's this voice inside me going,
"You're doing it."

06:15.760 --> 06:18.957
Then she started to cry,
and I weakened a little bit.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.475
I almost relented, but the voice,
Jerry, the voice said:

06:21.640 --> 06:24.359
"Keep going. Keep going.
You're almost out."

06:24.520 --> 06:26.238
It's like I was making a prison break.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.753
I'm heading for the wall.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.674
And I trip and twist my ankle and they
throw that light on you. You know?

06:32.560 --> 06:36.155
Somehow I get through the crying
and I keep running.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.833
Then the cursing started.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.956
She's firing at me
from the guard towers.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.793
"Son of a..." Bang!
"Son of a..." Boom!

06:42.960 --> 06:45.190
I get to the top of the wall,
the front door...

06:45.360 --> 06:46.873
...I open it up, I'm one foot away.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.112
I take one last look around
the penitentiary, and I jump!

06:50.720 --> 06:52.676
See? Never as bad as you imagine.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.274
I like that Marlene.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.672
What's her number?

06:57.160 --> 06:59.390
Yeah, no, l... I don't think so.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.550
Could you stop that smacking?

07:03.720 --> 07:05.790
George, I want you to taste
this cantaloupe.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.190
- No, thank you.
- It's the best cantaloupe I've had.

07:08.360 --> 07:09.918
- No, really.
- I'll get you a piece.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.197
- Jerry, tell him how good it is.
- Very good cantaloupe.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.077
So that's it. You're out.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.314
Except for one small problem.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.077
I left some books in her apartment.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.912
So? Go get them.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.595
No, I can't go back there.
Jerry, it's so awkward.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.149
It could be dangerous, sexually.
Something could happen.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.834
I'd be right back where I started from.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.718
So forget about the books.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.030
- Did you read them?
- Well, yeah.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.557
What do you need them for?

07:44.120 --> 07:45.712
I don't know. They're books.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.916
What is this obsession
people have with books?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.435
They put them in their houses
like they're trophies.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.591
What do you need it for
after you read it?

07:52.760 --> 07:54.273
They're my books.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.915
So you want me to get the books,
is that it?

08:01.080 --> 08:02.911
So it must have been 95 degrees
that night...

08:03.080 --> 08:06.959
...and everyone's standing around the
pool with little drinks in their hands.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.112
I was wearing my old jeans
and T-shirt.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.874
I don't know, I was just
in one of those moods...

08:13.040 --> 08:18.194
...so I said to myself, "Marlene,
just do it." And I jumped in.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.352
As I'm getting out,
I feel all these eyes on me.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.512
So I look up,
and everyone is just staring at me.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.873
So, what did you do?

08:28.040 --> 08:30.759
Well, nothing. It's no skin off my hide
if people like to look.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.115
I just didn't see what
the big attraction was.

08:33.799 --> 08:36.792
Well, I have a general idea
what it was.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.597
I could take a guess.

08:39.559 --> 08:40.993
Hey, you know, Jerry...

08:41.159 --> 08:43.515
...just because George
and I don't see each other...

08:43.679 --> 08:46.319
...doesn't mean we shouldn't
stay friends.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.194
No.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.474
Good enough. I'm really glad
we got that settled.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.754
Great.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.434
I don't know how this happened.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.636
Jerry, it's not my fault.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.831
No, it's not your fault.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.877
"Books, books, I need my books."

09:08.160 --> 09:11.232
Have you reread those books yet,
by the way?

09:12.360 --> 09:14.828
The great thing, when you read
Moby Dick the second time...

09:15.000 --> 09:17.798
...Ahab and the whale
become good friends.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.109
It's not like Marlene's
a bad person or anything...

09:22.280 --> 09:25.158
...but, my God, we've had
three lunches and a movie...

09:25.320 --> 09:26.992
...and she never stops calling.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.075
And it's those meaningless,
purposeless, blather calls.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.310
She never asks if I'm busy
or anything.

09:33.480 --> 09:37.155
I just pick up the phone
and she's in the middle of a sentence.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.594
It's standard.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.193
Has she left you a message...

09:40.360 --> 09:42.794
...where she uses up
the whole machine?

09:42.960 --> 09:46.919
You know, sometimes
she'll go, "Hello, Jerry?"

09:47.080 --> 09:50.277
And I'll go, "Oh, hi, Marlene."

09:50.440 --> 09:52.556
And then it's, "Jerry...

09:52.720 --> 09:54.711
...I don't know sometimes."
- "Know sometimes."

09:55.760 --> 09:58.354
What about trying
to get off the phone?

09:59.760 --> 10:01.716
You can't. It's impossible.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.872
There's no break in the conversation
where you can go:

10:05.040 --> 10:06.598
"All right, then."

10:06.760 --> 10:10.673
You know, it just goes on and on
without a break in the wall.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.637
I mean, I've gotta put a stop to this.

10:13.160 --> 10:16.516
Just do it like a Band-Aid.
One motion. Right off!

10:18.120 --> 10:19.553
She is sexy, though.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.553
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.119
Yeah, she is.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.631
- Mr. Costanza?
- Yeah?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.438
The doctor will see you now.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.591
Yeah. "Doctor."

10:35.600 --> 10:39.036
I'm gonna have to wait in that
little room all by myself, aren't I?

10:39.960 --> 10:41.518
I better take this.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.671
I hate the little room.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.434
Oh, hello, doctor.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.358
Waiting room. I hate when they
make you wait in the room.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.999
Because it says waiting room.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.752
There's no chance of not waiting...

10:54.960 --> 10:58.839
...because they call it the waiting
room. They're gonna use it.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.718
It's all set up for you to wait.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.916
You sit there and you got
your little magazine.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.958
You pretend you read it, but you're
really looking at other people.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.239
You know, you're thinking
about them. Things like:

11:11.400 --> 11:13.550
"I wonder what he's got."

11:17.320 --> 11:19.550
And, "Soon as she goes,
I'm getting her magazine."

11:21.080 --> 11:24.038
Then they finally call you,
and it's a very exciting moment.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.553
They finally call you.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.393
You stand up and kind of look
around at the other people.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.553
"Well, I guess I've been chosen.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.630
I'll see you all later."

11:35.800 --> 11:38.837
You think you're gonna see the doctor,
but you're not, are you? No.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.956
You're going into
the next waiting room.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.076
The littler waiting room.

11:44.600 --> 11:48.195
But if they are doing some
sort of medical thing to you...

11:48.360 --> 11:51.477
...you want to be in the smallest room
that they have. I think.

11:51.640 --> 11:55.110
You don't want to be in
the largest room that they have.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.919
You ever see these operating
theatres that they have...

11:58.080 --> 11:59.798
...with, like, stadium seating?

11:59.960 --> 12:01.598
You don't want them
doing anything...

12:01.760 --> 12:05.275
...that makes other doctors go,
"I have to see this.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.874
Are you kidding? Are they
gonna really do that to him?

12:08.040 --> 12:10.634
Are there seats? Can we get in?"

12:11.080 --> 12:12.832
Do they scalp tickets
to these things?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.753
"I got two for the Winslow tumour.
I got two."

12:22.320 --> 12:23.878
So how was it?

12:24.040 --> 12:26.998
I was in there for two minutes.
He didn't do anything.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.151
Touch this, feel that. 75 bucks.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.559
Well, it's a first visit.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.393
What's 75 bucks?

12:34.560 --> 12:36.232
What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?

12:37.760 --> 12:40.957
Am I being entertained?
I don't understand this.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.348
I'm only paying half.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.192
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

12:45.360 --> 12:47.191
He's a doctor.
You gotta pay what he says.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.238
No, no, no. I pay what I say.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.472
You feeling weird?

12:57.640 --> 12:58.834
No.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.831
I'm fine.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.837
- Nothing really happened.
- Yeah.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.832
I know.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.195
We just kissed a little.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.028
People kiss.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.193
Yeah.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.358
Well...

13:18.720 --> 13:20.517
Night.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.997
Good night.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.993
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.151
- I got it. This time I got it.
- All right.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.993
Hips. See, it's all in the hips.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.674
Gotta come through
with the hips first.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.750
That is out there.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.672
Definitely.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.990
- Joe's?
- No. Supermarket.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.908
Well, is it good?

14:01.080 --> 14:04.595
- It's... It's okay.
- Let me taste that.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.759
See? That stinks.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.714
- You can't eat that. Take that back.
- I'm not taking it back.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.950
- I'll take it back.
- I don't care about it.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.953
You should care. Cantaloupe
like this should be out of circulation.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.793
All right. Take it back.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.471
- No.
- Leave a message. I'll call you back.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.758
Jerry, have you ever
tak en a bath in the dark?

14:32.480 --> 14:35.233
I'm not talking into the soap
right now.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.470
Call me back.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.952
Who was that?

14:40.120 --> 14:41.951
- Marlene.
- Mar...

14:44.240 --> 14:45.514
- Marlene.
- Yeah.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.478
I took her home one night.
We started up a little in the car.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.835
- I thought you were getting rid of her.
- I was.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.594
But she's got me, like, hypnotized
or something.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.557
- Does George know?
- No. He'd go nuts.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.756
Yeah, no kidding.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.515
I feel terrible.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.236
I've seen her a couple
of times since then...

15:08.400 --> 15:11.437
...and I know I can't go
any further, but...

15:11.600 --> 15:15.149
She's got this psychosexual
hold over me. I just want her.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.072
I can't breathe. It's like a drug.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.196
Psychosexual.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.231
I don't know how I'm gonna tell him.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.868
Man, I don't understand people.

15:28.040 --> 15:31.350
Why would George want
to deprive you of pleasure?

15:31.520 --> 15:33.033
Is it just me?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.430
It's partially you, yeah.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.188
You're his friend.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.351
Better that she should sleep
with someone else?

15:39.520 --> 15:42.318
Some jerk that he doesn't even know?

15:42.760 --> 15:44.830
- He can't kill me, right?
- You're a human being.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.634
She called me. I never called her.
She started it.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.792
- You're flesh and blood.
- I'm a nice guy.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.832
- Hi.
- Hi, Elaine.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.475
My little airplane lamp.

15:56.200 --> 15:59.715
You have the slowest elevator
in the entire city.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.519
That's hard to get used to when
you're on so many fast ones.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.148
Apartment elevators are always
slower than offices...

16:05.320 --> 16:07.356
...because you don't have
to be home on time.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.830
- Unless you're married to a dictator.
- Yeah.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.718
Because they'd be very
demanding people.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.757
Right. Exactly.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.558
I imagine at some point somebody's
gonna offer me some cantaloupe?

16:19.720 --> 16:21.312
No. No good.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.472
Well, you know what they say,
lucky in love, unlucky with fruit.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.234
Well, I'm taking this back.

16:31.640 --> 16:36.953
So I had what you might call
a little encounter this morning.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.917
Really? That guy
who stopped saying hello?

16:39.080 --> 16:40.274
- Yes.
- You talk to him?

16:40.440 --> 16:42.158
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.551
At first I was just gonna walk on by
but then I thought, "No, no.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.950
- Do not be afraid of this man."
- Right.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.918
So I walked up behind him, tapped
him on the shoulder and said:

16:51.080 --> 16:53.116
"Hi, remember me?"

16:53.280 --> 16:55.350
And he furrows his brow...

16:55.520 --> 16:57.954
...as if he's really trying
to figure it out.

16:58.120 --> 17:01.317
So I said to him...
I said, "You little phoney.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.959
You know exactly who I am."

17:03.240 --> 17:06.471
- You said, "You little phoney"?
- I did. I most certainly did.

17:06.960 --> 17:12.955
And he goes, "Oh, yeah, you're
Jeanette's friend. We did meet once."

17:13.119 --> 17:16.031
I said, "How do you go from that
to totally ignoring a person...

17:16.200 --> 17:17.952
...when they walk by?"
- This is amazing.

17:18.440 --> 17:23.513
And he says, "Look, I just didn't
want to say hello anymore, all right?"

17:23.680 --> 17:27.229
And I said, "Fine. I didn't want
to say hello anymore either.

17:27.400 --> 17:31.154
But I just wanted you to know
that I'm aware of it."

17:32.560 --> 17:35.074
You are the queen of confrontation.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.356
You're my new hero.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.788
You've inspired me. I'm gonna call
George about something right now.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.040
This cantaloupe stinks.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.433
I don't care.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.830
- You're kidding.
- No, I don't care.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.558
- You mean that?
- Absolutely.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.472
- You don't care?
- No.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.279
- How could you not care?
- I don't know, but I don't.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.396
Actually, I'm almost happy to hear it.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.031
- I thought you'd be upset.
- I guess I should be, but I'm not.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.516
Am I a bad person?
Did I do something terrible?

18:11.680 --> 18:13.830
You're a fine person.
You're a humanitarian.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.319
She's very sexy.

18:15.480 --> 18:19.473
- That voice. She's driving me crazy.
- I know. I know.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.392
I can see her tonight
and you don't care?

18:21.560 --> 18:24.552
See her tonight. See her tomorrow.
Go, knock yourself out.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.871
- She's too crazy for me.
- All right. As long as you're okay.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.554
- I can't stop thinking about it.
- I'm okay. I'm fine.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.553
I'm wonderful. I never
felt better in my whole life.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.392
Good.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.354
I'll tell you what.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.954
You don't have to pay the $35
I gave the chiropractor...

18:40.120 --> 18:41.712
...for the rest of your bill.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.677
You paid that crook?

18:43.840 --> 18:46.115
- I had to.
- He didn't do anything, Jerry.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.636
- It's a scam. Who told you to do that?
- It was embarrassing to me.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.598
I was trying to make a point.

18:51.760 --> 18:54.558
Why don't you make a point
with your own doctor?

18:55.360 --> 18:56.873
What's wrong?

18:57.040 --> 18:59.952
- I think I swallowed a fly.
- Oh, God.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.993
I swallowed a fly!

19:02.440 --> 19:03.919
What do I do?

19:04.080 --> 19:06.150
What can happen?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.150
So you want to come up
for a few minutes?

19:14.240 --> 19:17.152
I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't
think this is gonna work.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.354
Really?

19:19.520 --> 19:21.158
- I thought...
- I know.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.799
I'm sorry.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.714
I just didn't expect it from the way
you've been acting.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.758
Are you sure you want to talk
about this? I sure don't.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.275
Of course I want to talk about it.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.193
Well, okay.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.193
I guess things changed for me
on Tuesday night.

19:38.360 --> 19:41.557
Tuesday night?
What happened Tuesday night?

19:41.720 --> 19:43.995
I saw your act.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.189
My act? What does that
have to do with anything?

19:49.600 --> 19:52.239
Well, to be honest...

19:52.400 --> 19:54.470
...it just didn't make it for me.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.234
It's just so much fluff.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.798
I can't believe this.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.599
What are you saying?
You didn't like my act?

20:02.760 --> 20:03.988
So that's it?

20:04.160 --> 20:07.118
I can't be with someone
if I don't respect what they do.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.755
You're a cashier.

20:10.720 --> 20:14.030
Look, Jerry, it just wasn't
my kind of humour.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.117
You can't go by the audience.
It was late, they were terrible.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.471
I heard the material.

20:21.440 --> 20:22.873
I have other stuff.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.349
You should come see me
on the weekend.

20:27.400 --> 20:32.110
Women need to like the job
of the guy they're with.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.113
If they don't like the job,
they don't like the guy.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.589
Men know this.

20:37.760 --> 20:42.880
Which is why we make up the phoney,
bogus names for the jobs we have.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.157
"Right now, I'm the regional
management supervisor.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.436
I'm in development,
research, consulting."

20:49.600 --> 20:53.832
Men, on the other hand, if they are
physically attracted to a woman...

20:54.000 --> 20:57.117
...are not that concerned
with her job, are we?

20:57.280 --> 20:58.508
Men don't really care.

20:58.680 --> 21:02.195
Men just go, "Really, slaughterhouse?
That where you work? Interesting.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.750
You got a big cleaver, just lopping
their heads off? Sounds great.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.480
Listen, why don't you shower up...

21:09.120 --> 21:11.714
...and we'll get some burgers
and catch a movie."
