-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.795 --> 00:05.547
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.424
HEY, SOMEONE POSTED ABOUT ME

00:07.507 --> 00:09.092
ON ISPIEDYOUCLEVELAND.COM.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.719
- OH, YOU HAVE
A SECRET ADMIRER?

00:10.802 --> 00:12.095
- YEAH, LISTEN TO THIS.

00:12.178 --> 00:14.222
"I SPIED YOU
IN LAKEWOOD PARK YESTERDAY,

00:14.305 --> 00:16.725
"GORGEOUS BRUNETTE
WITH AMAZING SMILE.

00:16.808 --> 00:19.561
"WITH A DELICATE,
PURPOSEFUL FLICK OF YOUR FINGER,

00:19.644 --> 00:21.271
"YOU TUCKED SOME
WAYWARD STRANDS OF HAIR

00:21.354 --> 00:23.481
BEHIND YOUR EAR
AND MELTED MY HEART."

00:23.565 --> 00:25.734
both: AW.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.403
- HEY, I WAS WITH YOU
AT THE PARK.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.447
- SO?

00:30.530 --> 00:33.241
- SO I COULD BE
THE GORGEOUS BRUNETTE.

00:33.324 --> 00:34.826
- [chuckling]
WELL...

00:34.909 --> 00:37.662
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD BE, BUT...

00:37.746 --> 00:39.622
- BUT...WHAT?

00:39.706 --> 00:41.666
- WELL, HE WROTE,
"AMAZING SMILE."

00:41.750 --> 00:43.293
- BUT YOU NEVER SMILE.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.253
- THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO AMAZING.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.464
- OKAY, THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THE LINE

00:47.547 --> 00:48.465
ABOUT THE HAIR TUCK?

00:48.548 --> 00:50.300
THAT'S MY SIGNATURE MOVE.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.634
- ALL RIGHT.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.303
TO HUMOR YOU,
LET'S WRITE HIM BACK

00:53.386 --> 00:54.554
FOR SOME MORE DETAILS.

00:54.637 --> 00:58.308
- YES, LET'S.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.018
- GATHER ROUND, PEOPLE.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.562
I HAVE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT.

01:02.645 --> 01:05.315
MY DAUGHTER EMMY
IS COMING TO VISIT.

01:05.397 --> 01:06.483
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.359
- OH, I HAVEN'T SEEN EMMY
IN SO LONG.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.360
WELL, HOW OLD IS SHE NOW?

01:09.444 --> 01:11.780
LET'S SEE, SHE WAS BORN
FOUR YEARS BEFORE WILL,

01:11.863 --> 01:13.948
SO SHE'S WHAT, 26?

01:14.032 --> 01:16.701
- THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.286
OH, NO, I REMEMBER,

01:18.369 --> 01:19.996
BECAUSE SHE WAS BORN
THE SAME YEAR I RECEIVED

01:20.079 --> 01:22.916
MY FIRST EMMY NOMINATION
FOR <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW.</i>

01:22.999 --> 01:24.626
YEAH, I NAMED HER EMMY
BECAUSE I FIGURED

01:24.709 --> 01:28.171
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
I WAS GONNA BRING ONE HOME.

01:28.254 --> 01:32.592
- SPEAKING OF WHICH,
HOW ARE TONY AND OSCAR?

01:32.675 --> 01:34.385
- WELL...

01:34.469 --> 01:38.348
IT WAS AN HONOR
JUST TO GIVE BIRTH TO THEM.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.016
I JUST WISH THAT I KNEW WHY
EMMY WAS COMING.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.060
SHE'S ALWAYS UP TO SOMETHING.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.394
- WELL, WHAT'D SHE SAY
ON THE PHONE?

01:43.478 --> 01:45.063
- THAT THE BRAZILIAN TELENOVELA
SHE STARRED IN

01:45.146 --> 01:46.147
GOT CANCELED.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.190
- NOOOO.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.568
THEY CANCELED
<i>TOO POOR TO DREAM?</i>

01:50.652 --> 01:52.362
- WELL, I'LL BET EMMY'S COMING

01:52.445 --> 01:53.655
BECAUSE HER SHOW
WAS CANCELED.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.323
AND YOUR SHOW WAS CANCELED.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.242
SO SHE'S JUST LOOKING
FOR SOME SYMPATHY,

01:57.325 --> 01:58.660
AND HER MOTHER'S LOVE.

01:58.743 --> 01:59.744
- FAT CHANCE.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.704
I JUST READ ON <i> TMZ</i>

02:01.788 --> 02:03.873
SHE'S WRITING A TELL-ALL BOOK
ABOUT YOU.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.083
- WHAT?!

02:05.166 --> 02:07.001
OH, NO!
THAT'S TERRIBLE!

02:07.085 --> 02:08.211
- WELL, IT MIGHT NOT BE BAD.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.545
MAYBE SHE'S WRITING
A TELL-ALL

02:09.628 --> 02:10.922
ABOUT WHAT A GREAT MOTHER
YOU ARE.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.883
- IT'S CALLED
<i>EVERY DAY IS MOTHER'S DAY.</i>

02:13.967 --> 02:15.552
- SEE?
THAT'S SWEET.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.053
- COLON...

02:17.137 --> 02:18.179
<i>HOW I SURVIVED BEING RAISED</i>

02:18.263 --> 02:20.765
<i>BY DAYTIME'S EVIL QUEEN.</i>

02:33.528 --> 02:35.363
{\an8}- HOW DID YOU GET
EMMY'S BOOK?

02:35.446 --> 02:37.699
{\an8}- OH, MY AGENT GOT
ADVANCE REVIEW COPIES

02:37.782 --> 02:38.908
{\an8}FROM HER PUBLISHER.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.743
{\an8}- DID YOU REALLY SEND
YOUR HOUSEKEEPER

02:40.827 --> 02:45.123
{\an8}TO STAND IN FOR YOU
AT EMMY'S MOTHER-DAUGHTER DAY?

02:45.206 --> 02:47.709
{\an8}-<i> AND</i> I PAID
FOR HER ENGLISH LESSONS

02:47.792 --> 02:50.044
{\an8}SO SHE COULD PULL IT OFF.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.881
{\an8}OF COURSE, THEY CONVENIENTLY
LEFT THAT OUT.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.552
{\an8}- WHY DID YOU SEND IN
A STAND-IN?

02:57.635 --> 02:59.095
{\an8}- WELL, I DIDN'T WANT EMMY
TO BE ALONE.

02:59.178 --> 03:00.597
{\an8}AND I WAS IN VANCOUVER

03:00.680 --> 03:02.181
{\an8}SHOOTING THE LIFETIME
ORIGINAL MOVIE

03:02.265 --> 03:07.103
{\an8}<i>ALWAYS BY YOUR SIDE.</i>

03:07.186 --> 03:08.271
{\an8}- WAIT, YOU LIED TO HER

03:08.354 --> 03:09.647
{\an8}ABOUT BEING ALLERGIC
TO SUGAR?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.107
{\an8}- WELL, TECHNICALLY, YES.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.734
{\an8}BUT, YOU KNOW,
BUT HER PERFECT TEETH

03:12.817 --> 03:14.068
{\an8}AND HER GORGEOUS FIGURE
SAY,

03:14.152 --> 03:17.739
{\an8}"THANKS FOR THE LIE,
MOMMY."

03:17.822 --> 03:19.866
{\an8}I HONESTLY MEANT WELL,
YOU KNOW.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.159
{\an8}AND EVEN WHEN I HAD
TO BE AWAY,

03:21.242 --> 03:22.911
{\an8}I ALWAYS MADE SURE
SHE WAS WELL TAKEN CARE OF.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.830
{\an8}SHE ABSOLUTELY ADORED
HER OLD IRISH NANNY,

03:25.914 --> 03:27.123
{\an8}NANNY BRIDGET.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.416
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
SHE'S THE REASON

03:28.499 --> 03:32.462
{\an8}THAT EMMY PRONOUNCES POTATOES
"PUH-TAY-TOES".

03:32.545 --> 03:34.464
{\an8}- ARE YOU GONNA TELL HER
YOU GOT AN ADVANCE COPY

03:34.547 --> 03:35.506
{\an8}OF THE BOOK?

03:35.590 --> 03:37.926
{\an8}- OF COURSE NOT.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.178
{\an8}NO, I AM GONNA JUST SHOWER HER
WITH KINDNESS

03:40.261 --> 03:42.931
{\an8}UNTIL SHE FEELS SO BAD
SHE KILLS IT.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.433
{\an8}GUILT, DENIAL,
EMOTIONAL EXTORTION...

03:45.516 --> 03:48.102
{\an8}OH, WHO SAYS I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MOTHER?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.816
[cell phone beeps]

03:53.900 --> 03:56.486
- OH, IT'S A FOLLOW-UP POST

03:56.569 --> 03:58.488
FROM THE "I SPIED YOU
CLEVELAND" GUY.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.656
- OKAY, OKAY.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.366
BEFORE WE READ THIS
AND FIND OUT

04:01.449 --> 04:03.618
WHICH ONE OF US
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT--

04:03.701 --> 04:05.954
I DON'T WANT THIS
TO AFFECT OUR FRIENDSHIP.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.789
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT COULD BE EITHER ONE OF US.

04:07.872 --> 04:08.998
- AGREED.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.210
MAY THE MOST AMAZING SMILE WIN.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.964
HERE WE GO.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.298
I'LL ARRANGE A MEETING
TOMORROW.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.341
WE'LL BOTH GO,

04:18.423 --> 04:19.968
AND THAT WAY WE'LL KNOW
FOR SURE.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.970
- YES, WELL,
YOU'LL KNOW FOR SURE.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.806
I ALREADY KNOW.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.519
ARE YOU BAKING COOKIES
FOR EMMY?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.396
- OH, I POURED VANILLA EXTRACT
ON TINFOIL

04:31.479 --> 04:35.483
AND PUT IT IN THE OVEN.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.361
CREATES A WARM
AND WELCOMING ATMOSPHERE.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.530
SO SHE'LL NEVER KNOW
I READ THE BOOK.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.573
- WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SHE WANTS A COOKIE?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.701
- OH, WELL, THAT'S WHY I WOKE UP
EARLY THIS MORNING

04:44.784 --> 04:46.411
AND DROVE OVER TO THAT BAKERY
ON FRANKLIN.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.205
AND THEN I SCATTERED
A HALF CUP OF FLOUR

04:49.288 --> 04:50.540
ALL OVER THE COUNTER.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.333
I WHISKED TWO EGGS
AND PUT THE SHELLS IN THE SINK

04:52.417 --> 04:54.752
SO SHE'D BE SURE
TO SEE THEM.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.045
- WOULDN'T IT
HAVE BEEN EASIER

04:56.129 --> 04:58.673
JUST TO BAKE THE COOKIES?

04:58.756 --> 05:02.552
- I DON'T TAKE SHORTCUTS, JOY.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.847
ANYWAY, ALL OF THIS COMBINED
WITH MY MIRRORING TECHNIQUE

05:05.930 --> 05:07.056
SHOULD WIN HER OVER.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.433
- MIRRORING?

05:08.516 --> 05:09.892
- YEAH, IT'S AN OLD
ACTING TRICK.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.769
YOU JUST BEHAVE EXACTLY LIKE
THE PERSON YOU'RE WITH.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.688
IT MAKES THEM FEEL
LIKE THEY'RE BEING HEARD

05:13.771 --> 05:16.524
AND SUBCONSCIOUSLY PUTS THEM
ON YOUR SIDE.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.527
I DO IT WITH YOU GUYS
ALL THE TIME.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.112
- THAT'S TERRIBLE!

05:21.195 --> 05:24.949
- I AGREE!

05:25.033 --> 05:27.076
[doorbell rings]

05:33.082 --> 05:35.084
- MOTHER.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.252
DARLING.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.212
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU,

05:38.296 --> 05:40.089
YOU LOOK YOUNGER
THAN THE TIME BEFORE.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.925
I MEAN, WHO ARE YOU,
BENJAMIN BUTTON?

05:43.009 --> 05:44.802
- DAUGHTER DARLING,

05:44.886 --> 05:47.055
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU,
YOU'RE EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.222
AND WHO ARE YOU?

05:48.306 --> 05:49.766
BENJAMIN BUTTON, JUNIOR?

05:49.849 --> 05:51.142
- HI.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.477
- AW.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.436
- OHHH.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.147
MELANIE AND JOY,
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.775
- HI, EMMY.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.568
- SO I MADE UP THE GUEST ROOM,

06:00.651 --> 06:01.778
AND TONIGHT I AM GOING
TO COOK YOU

06:01.861 --> 06:02.779
YOUR FAVORITE DINNER.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.698
- BROILED SALMON
AND FINGERLING PUH-TAY-TOES.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.244
WAIT A MINUTE.
[sniffs]

06:10.328 --> 06:13.414
I SMELL FOIL COOKIES.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.333
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO NICE?
[gasps]

06:15.416 --> 06:17.085
OH, MY GOD,
YOU READ THE BOOK!

06:17.168 --> 06:19.295
- OH, MY GOD,
I READ THE BOOK!

06:19.378 --> 06:21.297
- HA!
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN!

06:21.380 --> 06:23.508
- HA!
YOU SHOULD'VE!

06:27.553 --> 06:29.097
- I THINK YOUR MOM
IS JUST HURT

06:29.180 --> 06:30.640
BY SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT YOU WROTE.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.934
- WELL, I MEAN,
THEY HAD TO BE SAID.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.645
SHE WAS A TERRIBLE MOTHER,
GALLIVANTING FROM SET TO SET,

06:35.728 --> 06:37.688
LEAVING YOUR TWO CHILDREN
TO BE RAISED BY STAFF.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.399
- I LEFT THREE CHILDREN.
I--

06:43.236 --> 06:44.862
- YES, THREE.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.656
- RIGHT, I ALWAYS FORGET TONY.

06:46.739 --> 06:47.657
- WELL, IT'S EASY TO DO.

06:47.740 --> 06:48.658
I MEAN, A CIVIL ENGINEER?

06:48.741 --> 06:49.826
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

06:49.909 --> 06:51.494
THAT HE'S NICE
WHEN HE DRIVES A TRAIN?

06:51.577 --> 06:54.497
- [laughing]
I KNOW.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.292
AND WHO EVEN TAKES TRAINS
ANYMORE?

06:58.376 --> 07:00.545
- ANYWAY, THE POINT IS,
YOU WERE NEVER AROUND.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.380
- YEAH, WELL, I HAD TO WORK.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.840
AND I DON'T RECALL YOU
COMPLAINING

07:03.923 --> 07:06.717
WHEN I BOUGHT YOU BOOBS
FOR YOUR 16TH BIRTHDAY.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.344
- WELL, I WANTED A CAR.

07:08.427 --> 07:09.804
- YEAH, WELL,
THOSE BOOBS GOT YOU RIDES

07:09.887 --> 07:12.640
IN LOTS OF CARS.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.519
AND I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU CAME HERE

07:16.602 --> 07:18.688
JUST TO THROW YOUR BOOK
IN MY FACE.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.232
- ACTUALLY, I CAME HERE
TO GET A QUOTE FROM YOU.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.817
AFTER I THREW MY BOOK
IN YOUR FACE.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.652
- WELL.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.028
I'M SORRY THAT I WASN'T
THE MOTHER

07:26.112 --> 07:27.905
THAT YOU WANTED ME TO BE.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.866
- WELL, I'M SORRY THAT I WASN'T
THE DAUGHTER

07:29.949 --> 07:31.033
YOU WANTED ME TO BE.

07:31.117 --> 07:36.038
- OH, MY GOD,
HOW DARE YOU MIRROR ME?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.707
- JUST LIKE YOUR CAREER,

07:37.790 --> 07:41.043
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.045
- I'M ON HIATUS.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.509
[slam]

07:48.593 --> 07:50.219
[slam]

07:50.303 --> 07:51.304
[door opens]

07:52.763 --> 07:54.223
- WHY DID YOU GO OUTSIDE?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.892
- IT WAS TOO LONG A CROSS
TO GO UPSTAIRS

07:55.975 --> 07:57.226
TO MY BEDROOM,

07:57.310 --> 07:59.061
AND I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO HAVE THE FIRST SLAM.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.735
WELL, THAT DIDN'T GO WELL.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.195
GOD, I JUST WISH
THERE WAS SOMEONE

08:07.278 --> 08:08.571
WHO COULD GET THROUGH
TO HER.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.406
- WELL, I COULD GIVE IT
A TRY.

08:10.489 --> 08:11.532
- OH, THAT'S SWEET
OF YOU, MEL,

08:11.616 --> 08:14.243
BUT LET'S FACE IT,
YOU'RE A WUSS.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.954
I MEAN,
SHE'D JUST EAT YOU ALIVE.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.706
AND YOU'RE MEAN ENOUGH, JOY,

08:18.789 --> 08:21.459
BUT, WELL, YOUR PERSONALITY
CAN BE OFF-PUTTING.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.586
NOT EVERYONE GETS YOUR DRY...
[pats Joy]

08:23.669 --> 08:25.922
HEARTLESS WIT.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.716
- ARE YOU TRYING TO GET US
TO WRITE A TELL-ALL BOOK?

08:28.799 --> 08:29.759
- OH, I AM SORRY.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.052
- WELL, HONEY,
DON'T YOU THINK

08:31.135 --> 08:32.470
THE BEST PERSON
TO TALK TO HER

08:32.553 --> 08:35.597
WOULD BE THE WOMAN
THAT RAISED HER?

08:35.681 --> 08:36.599
- OF COURSE.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.101
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.437
SO HERE SHE IS.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.481
THE WOMAN WHO RAISED YOU,

08:43.563 --> 08:46.609
YOUR OLD NANNY BRIDGET.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.989
- [fake Irish accent]
YES, 'TIS I,

08:52.073 --> 08:55.117
NANNY BRIDGET.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.793
- HE SAID HE'D BE THE ONE
WITH THE ROSE

09:03.876 --> 09:05.461
AT HIS TABLE.

09:05.544 --> 09:06.712
[flatly]
OH, BOY.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.301
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE HE SEES US.

09:12.385 --> 09:16.013
HE'S WAVING US OVER.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.014
- WELCOME.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.474
I'M AUSTIN.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.101
I'M GLAD YOU LADIES
MADE IT.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.311
- YOU WERE EXPECTING
BOTH OF US?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.771
- YES, I WANTED TO GIVE YOU BOTH
A SHOT,

09:23.854 --> 09:27.817
SO I KEPT IT VAGUE.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.777
- LOOK, YOU SEEM LIKE
A NICE KID,

09:29.860 --> 09:31.529
AND YOU WRITE AMAZING PROSE,

09:31.612 --> 09:32.863
BUT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS,

09:32.947 --> 09:34.991
THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK OUT.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.242
I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE NO TROUBLE
FINDING A GIRL

09:36.325 --> 09:37.827
YOUR OWN AGE.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.997
- I'M ALREADY
IN A SATISFYING RELATIONSHIP.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.332
NOW, I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
FOR MY FATHER.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.167
- "I SPIED YOU CLEVELAND"?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.377
- WELCOME.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.546
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

09:48.629 --> 09:50.006
- YOU POSTED ABOUT HER, TOO?

09:50.089 --> 09:52.842
- I'LL EXPLAIN.
HAVE A SEAT.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.054
I HAVE TWO ROSES.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.889
ONE OF YOU
WILL BE ELIMINATED

09:58.973 --> 10:01.892
BEFORE WE GET TO THE FINAL ROUND
WITH MY DAD.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.187
- SO THIS IS FOR A DATE
WITH YOUR FATHER?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.523
- LOOK, THIS IS CRAZY.

10:07.606 --> 10:08.858
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.234
- OH, WELL, THEN I GUESS
HE'S ALL YOURS.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.736
I HOPE YOU LIKE ABS.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.491
- I SUPPOSE WE COULD STAY
FOR A MINUTE.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.535
- IS THAT ALLOWED?
THEY DID LEAVE.

10:19.618 --> 10:21.871
- MY DAD ROWED CREW
FOR HARVARD

10:21.954 --> 10:24.874
AND LATER COMPETED
IN THE '98 OLYMPICS.

10:24.957 --> 10:28.711
HE OWNS HIS OWN LANDSCAPE
ARCHITECTURE FIRM.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.172
AND HE'S ALSO
RECENTLY WIDOWED.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.381
SO BASICALLY,

10:32.465 --> 10:34.884
THIS IS JUST LIKE
<i>SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.</i>

10:34.967 --> 10:37.428
- AW...

10:39.764 --> 10:41.098
- YOU LOOK SO DIFFERENT.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.684
- TIME CAN BE A CRUEL MISTRESS.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.896
HAVE YOU SEEN
VAL KILMER LATELY?

10:46.979 --> 10:49.857
- I MEAN SHE'S PRETTIER
THAN I REMEMBER.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.068
- AS ARE YOU, MY WEE 'UN.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.863
AH, YOU'RE AS BUXOM
AS THE HILLS OF DERRY.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.531
[laughs]

10:57.615 --> 11:01.035
EMPHASIS ON THE DERRY.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.370
- I JUST GREW UP.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.789
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.707
- OKAY, OVER THE YEARS,

11:06.791 --> 11:08.793
I'VE SENT MONEY
TO NANNY BRIDGET

11:08.876 --> 11:11.087
FOR SOME EXTENSIVE
PLASTIC SURGERY.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.380
I ASKED HER NOT TO SAY ANYTHING

11:12.463 --> 11:14.590
BECAUSE I LIKE MY GOOD DEEDS
TO BE SECRET.

11:14.673 --> 11:17.426
- WHAT GOOD DEEDS?

11:17.510 --> 11:20.554
- YOU SEE?

11:20.638 --> 11:21.555
- OKAY.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.766
YEAH.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.559
I CAN SEE IT
RIGHT THERE IN YOUR EYES.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.436
IT IS YOU.
[squeals]

11:27.520 --> 11:29.063
NANNY, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

11:29.146 --> 11:32.233
- WELL, I'LL JUST LEAVE
YOU TWO ALONE, THEN.

11:32.316 --> 11:36.153
- YEP, YOU ALWAYS DID.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.156
- NOW, DON'T BE TALKIN'
TO YOUR MOTHER LIKE THAT.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.409
- [sighs]
I'M SORRY, NANNY.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.953
LOOK, I KNOW THAT THIS
IS GONNA SOUND REALLY SILLY,

11:44.036 --> 11:45.621
BUT WILL YOU PLEASE
SING ME THAT SONG

11:45.704 --> 11:47.832
THAT I USED TO LOVE
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL?

11:47.915 --> 11:49.959
- AYE, THAT I WILL.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.629
NOW, CLOSE YOUR WEE EYES,
AS YOU ALWAYS DID.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.047
- I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.300

12:46.223 --> 12:47.850
AND NOT DWELL

12:56.901 --> 12:58.986
AND JANICE LOWREY,
SHE BEAT ME OUT

12:59.069 --> 13:00.821
FOR THE SUGARPLUM FAIRY
IN <i> THE NUTCRACKER,</i>

13:00.905 --> 13:03.324

13:11.790 --> 13:13.209
AND I FELT TERRIBLE

13:13.292 --> 13:14.752
BECAUSE THEN SHE GOT ALL
OF THE ATTENTION.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.295
I MEAN, SHE EVEN GOT
HER OWN CURTAIN CALL.

13:16.378 --> 13:17.630
- JUST LIKE YOUR BOOK.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.549
IT COULD MAKE EVERYONE
FEEL SORRY FOR YOUR MUM.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.052

TO PLAY OURSELVES.

- STOP WHATEVER
YOU ARE DOING, EMMY.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.278
I JUST LEARNED
THAT THIS WOMAN IS A FRAUD.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.239
SHE IS NOT

IT WAS GOOD.
HE SAID WE REALLY CONNECTED.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.784
I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE'S STILL IN THE RUNNING.

14:28.867 --> 14:30.286
HE SAID HE WAS LOOKING FOR
SOMEONE DOWN-TO-EARTH.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.288
- OH, SHE IS <i> SO</i> NOT
DOWN-TO-EARTH.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.373
WE'RE DOWN-TO-EARTH.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.625

A REALLY GREAT ARTICLE

14:46.260 --> 14:48.262

- WELL, YOU WERE NEVER
REALLY ALLERGIC TO PIZZA.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.139
- WELL, I WISH I WOULD HAVE

WHEN I PLAYED

RESEARCH FOR MY BOOK,

16:34.159 --> 16:35.953
I ASKED DAD
WHAT BUSINESS HE WAS IN,

16:36.036 --> 16:38.163
BUT HE WAS VERY VAGUE.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.249
- HIS BUSINESS, UH,

16:40.332 --> 16:42.209
WAS UP-TO-NO-GOOD
BUSINESS.

16:42.292 --> 16:45.254
SEE, YOUR FATHER
HAD A WANDERING EYE.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.381
THAT'S HOW WE ENDED UP
WITH OLD NANNY BRIDGET.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.924
YOU KNOW, I FIGURED
EVEN YOUR FATHER

16:49.007 --> 16:50.217
WOULDN'T HIT ON

16:50.300 --> 16:52.886

16:52.970 --> 16:55.305
- I NEVER KNEW
ANY OF THIS.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.267
- WELL,
NO CHILD SHOULD HAVE TO.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.394
SEE, MY DAD DID THE SAME THING,
AND I DID KNOW.

17:00.477 --> 17:04.397
AND I JUST WAS TRYING
TO SPARE YOU THAT.

17:04.481 --> 17:05.648
SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD
TO BE AN ACTRESS

17:05.733 --> 17:08.109
IN REAL LIFE, TOO.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.279
AND I KNOW THAT EVERY PARENT
USES IT AS AN EXCUSE,

17:10.362 --> 17:12.281
BUT...

17:12.364 --> 17:17.077
I REALLY DID DO
THE VERY BEST THAT I COULD.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.079
- I KNOW, MOM.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.873
AND I GENUINELY DO
FORGIVE YOU.

17:20.955 --> 17:22.790

17:22.875 --> 17:24.917
- BUT WE CANNOT PUT THAT
IN THE MOVIE.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.212
I MEAN, IT WILL RUIN
THE ENDING.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.301
- JOY.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.635
MELANIE.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.762
EILEEN.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.973
THIS HAS BEEN
AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.434
EACH OF YOU
IS VERY SPECIAL.

17:40.517 --> 17:41.852
BUT AS YOU KNOW,

17:41.935 --> 17:43.979
I ONLY HAVE TWO ROSES.

17:44.062 --> 17:46.815
- THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.150
- I KNOW.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.319
HE REALLY KNOWS
HOW TO DRAG IT OUT.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.487
- EILEEN.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.072
WE HAD AN AMAZING TIME
PLAYING DARTS.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.657
BUT...

17:55.741 --> 17:57.034
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEELING

17:57.117 --> 17:59.328
THAT YOU'RE
A VERY GUARDED PERSON.

17:59.411 --> 18:03.874
YOU HAVE A WALL
AROUND YOUR HEART.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.168
- SHE IS SO OUTTA HERE.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.003
- I'D LIKE MY DAD
TO HAVE A CHANCE

18:08.086 --> 18:08.796
TO SEE BEHIND THAT WALL.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.339
- WHAT?

18:10.422 --> 18:14.384
- WHAT'S BEHIND THAT WALL
IS A VACANT LOT.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.679
- EILEEN, WILL YOU ACCEPT
THIS ROSE?

18:17.763 --> 18:19.681
- I WILL.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.308
OH!

18:23.769 --> 18:26.605
- JOY.
MELANIE.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.525
I WISH I COULD TAKE YOU BOTH
TO THE FINAL ROUND.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.820
BUT THERE'S ONLY
ONE ROSE LEFT.

18:32.903 --> 18:33.862
- YES, WE KNOW.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.865
WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST TELL US
WHO IT IS ALREADY?

18:36.949 --> 18:40.828
- I WILL...

18:40.911 --> 18:43.872
BUT FIRST LET ME SAY
YOU'RE BOTH AMAZING,

18:43.956 --> 18:47.584
AND ANY GUY WOULD BE LUCKY
TO HAVE EITHER OF YOU.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.211
TWO WOMEN.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.712
ONE ROSE.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.216
THIS WASN'T AN EASY DECISION.

18:54.299 --> 18:59.221
BUT THE FINAL ROSE
GOES TO...

18:59.304 --> 19:00.764
- AUSTIN!
- DAD?

19:03.433 --> 19:05.352
- OH, ARE YOU DOING
THIS AGAIN?

19:05.435 --> 19:07.396
I TOLD YOU BEFORE.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.274
I'M NOT LEAVING
YOUR STEPMOTHER.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.861
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS, LADIES.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.028
COME ON, AUSTIN.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.446
- SORRY.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.781
- WAIT, WHO WOULD'VE GOTTEN
THE ROSE?

19:17.865 --> 19:19.032
- YES, NOT THAT IT MATTERS,

19:19.116 --> 19:20.534
BUT WHICH ONE OF US
WOULD YOU HAVE CHOSEN?

19:20.617 --> 19:22.035
- THE ONE WITH THE SPARKLE
IN HER EYE

19:22.119 --> 19:23.287
AND THE SADNESS IN HER HEART.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.415
both: AW...

19:33.338 --> 19:34.756
- SO WHO'S GONNA PLAY ME
IN THE MOVIE?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.466
- DON'T KNOW,
BUT I DESCRIBED YOU

19:36.550 --> 19:37.593
AS THE SANDRA BULLOCK TYPE.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.345
- YES!
I LOVE SANDRA BULLOCK!

19:45.893 --> 19:47.644
EVERYONE SAYS I LOOK
EXACTLY LIKE--

19:47.728 --> 19:49.104
- NO, THEY DON'T.
NOBODY SAYS IT.

19:49.187 --> 19:50.439
YOU SAY IT.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.024
[cell phone beeps]

19:52.107 --> 19:54.276
- OH, SORRY,

19:54.359 --> 19:55.485
[gasps]

19:55.569 --> 19:57.279
I HAVE BEEN OFFERED

20:04.536 --> 20:06.622
BUT YOU'RE STILL GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO OUR MOVIE, RIGHT?

20:06.705 --> 20:07.456
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

20:07.539 --> 20:11.919

20:12.002 --> 20:14.087
- THE DOWNSIDE IS

20:20.302 --> 20:21.970
YOU'RE AN IMPARTIAL OBSERVER.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.181
WHICH ONE OF US
HAS A SPARKLE IN HER EYE

20:24.264 --> 20:26.058
AND A SADNESS
IN HER HEART?

20:26.141 --> 20:27.684

20:27.768 --> 20:29.519
