CHRIS ROCK:
During my first season working
with the football team,

00:06.207 --> 00:07.141
I had good times.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.376
Come on, man.
Get in here.

00:08.409 --> 00:09.810
For real?
Yeah, man.

00:09.843 --> 00:13.047
You as much a part of this
team as everybody else.

00:16.284 --> 00:18.152
* You were the girl

00:18.186 --> 00:20.621
* That changed my world

00:20.654 --> 00:22.656
And I had bad times.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.394
* You lit the fuse

00:26.427 --> 00:28.662
But I was glad it was over.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.465
Just because your work
on the field is done

00:31.499 --> 00:34.102
doesn't mean your job
with the team is over.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.803
It's time to start
thinking about

00:35.836 --> 00:37.771
what we do in the field of life.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.373
So I've signed

00:39.407 --> 00:41.675
the team up
for community service.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.611
That's what they used
to call slavery.

00:43.644 --> 00:47.648
I myself have always been
a big supporter of big brothers.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.151
She's not talking
about the organization.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.620
My... you're
a big brother.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.689
Let's dance.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.691
So I'm bringing a rep from

00:57.725 --> 01:00.428
the Brother from Another Mother
organization to our school!

01:00.461 --> 01:01.662
Brother from Another Mother?

01:01.695 --> 01:03.764
Yes, they help match
enfranchised youth

01:03.797 --> 01:05.699
with disenfranchised youths,

01:05.733 --> 01:09.670
such as blacks and Latinos,
to help support and guide them.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.672
Uh-huh.
What if I'm already

01:11.705 --> 01:13.374
supporting some Latino kids?

01:13.407 --> 01:17.445
Well, if you're already a
baby daddy, then you're excused.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.280
Yes!
Do you get extra credit

01:19.313 --> 01:20.881
if you're a baby granddaddy?

01:20.914 --> 01:23.151
But the rest of you,
fill out these forms

01:23.184 --> 01:25.586
so I can set you up
with appointments.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.388
You, too, Chris.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.357
If you want to remain
team manager,

01:29.390 --> 01:30.391
you have to do this.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.760
Even if all you do
is clean sweaty jockstraps,

01:32.793 --> 01:34.795
you're just as important
as the quarterback.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.797
I wish somebody would
let the cheerleaders know.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.499
It's people like you, Chris,

01:38.532 --> 01:40.668
that make the ghetto
a better place to live.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.771
And it's people like you
that get robbed if I don't.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.486
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.808
I already had a younger brother
from the same mother.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.844
The last thing I wanted
was one from another mother.

02:23.877 --> 02:27.248
Being a Brother from Another
Mother is a huge responsibility.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.683
Your influence
is molding a mind,

02:29.717 --> 02:31.519
changing the course of a life.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.354
You could say the same thing
about crack.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.322
Okay.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.456
I'm proud to do it.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.890
That said, I need to evaluate

02:36.924 --> 02:38.726
your suitability
for this organization.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.693
No problem.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.564
Are you sexually active?

02:43.597 --> 02:44.865
No.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.934
Now that I'm married,
the answer's still the same.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.636
Do you own
photographic equipment?

02:48.669 --> 02:49.670
No.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.605
Where do you keep your
photographic equipment?

02:51.639 --> 02:54.342
I don't have
any photographic equipment.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.544
Have you ever sold
any of your photographs?

02:56.577 --> 02:57.711
I don't have any photographs.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.613
Suppose you did.

02:59.647 --> 03:00.548
Where would you keep them?

03:00.581 --> 03:03.851
I don't own a camera
or any photographs.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.320
If your Brother from Another
Mother came to your house,

03:06.354 --> 03:07.855
what room would you spend
the most time in?

03:07.888 --> 03:09.723
The living room, I guess.

03:09.757 --> 03:10.991
Correct.

03:11.024 --> 03:11.925
How's your relationship
with your father?

03:11.959 --> 03:13.594
It's fine.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.196
Where does your father keep
his photographic equipment?

03:17.998 --> 03:20.734
When he was done getting
answers out of me,

03:20.768 --> 03:23.404
my family started getting
answers out of a machine.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.538
I want to leave
the message.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.706
It has to be
a man's voice.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.807
Look, I bought it,
I'll leave it.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.008
Why can't I do it?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.443
Because everybody hates you.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.445
Everybody, be quiet.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.846
I'll leave the message.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.983
Hello.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.551
Thank you for calling.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.253
No one is available

03:39.287 --> 03:40.988
to take your call right now.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.456
At the sound of the tone,

03:42.490 --> 03:43.857
please leave...
It's a beep.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.893
What's the difference?

03:45.926 --> 03:48.629
Some people are tone-deaf,
but nobody's beep-deaf.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.298
Fine.
Please.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.599
I'll do it again.
I-I can do it.

03:52.766 --> 03:53.734
Quiet, shh!

03:53.767 --> 03:54.735
Shh.

03:56.804 --> 03:57.905
Hello.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.640
Thank you for calling.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.710
No one is available
to take your call right now.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.679
Please leave a message
at the sound of the beep,

04:05.713 --> 04:06.647
and we'll get back

04:06.680 --> 04:09.550
to you as quickly as possible.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.951
But what if
we don't want

04:10.984 --> 04:13.287
to get back to someone
as quickly as possible?

04:13.321 --> 04:14.622
It means you're a girl.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.723
Be quiet.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.525
I'll do it again.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.627
Shh! Stop moving
so much!
Stop pushing.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.529
It's not my fault!
His head
is in the way.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.696
Okay, shh!

04:22.730 --> 04:24.632
Last time.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.567
Hello.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.069
No one is available
to take this call right now.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.372
Please leave a message
at the sound of the beep.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.807
See?

04:33.841 --> 04:34.775
Is that good
for everybody?

04:34.808 --> 04:35.776
Yeah, that was good.
Yeah.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.312
You sound like
a white woman.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.614
Get out of here before I smack
the naps out your hair.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.750
Now she sounds like
a black woman.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.352
If it's a murder...

04:44.385 --> 04:45.586
When I was growing up,

04:45.619 --> 04:48.656
talk shows were usually hosted
by old white men.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.591
Mike Douglas, Phil Donahue,

04:50.624 --> 04:53.361
Merv Griffin, Dick Cavett.

04:53.394 --> 04:56.430
But in 1986, one woman
changed that forever.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.768
:
Op-rah Winfrey.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.403
"How to have
a stronger marriage."

05:02.436 --> 05:03.504
Hmm.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.005
And with that,
Oprah's primary fan base,

05:05.038 --> 05:07.641
married working class men,

05:07.675 --> 05:09.076
began to take shape.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.544
CHRIS:
Well, I just got assigned

05:10.578 --> 05:12.380
my Brother from
Another Mother today.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.246
Hope it's not a big hassle.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.749
Wish I had one.
I'd love to be a mentor.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.918
To form a lifelong bond, to know
if I never did another thing

05:17.951 --> 05:19.853
in my life, I'd have made
a difference in this world.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.590
Which is why Greg had
the happiest pet turtle.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.791
Why don't you sign up?

05:23.824 --> 05:24.758
I own a camera.

05:24.792 --> 05:25.526
So who's the kid?

05:25.559 --> 05:27.628
Cleavon Barris.
Where's he live?

05:27.661 --> 05:28.529
Bed-Stuy, which is weird
'cause I thought

05:28.562 --> 05:29.697
I knew all the kids
in the neighborhood.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.799
See? All black people
don't know each other.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.901
That is weird. I thought all
black people knew each other.

05:33.934 --> 05:37.671
Back at home, my father spent
the afternoon with Oprah

05:37.705 --> 05:39.540
to get ready for an evening
with my mother.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.079
What's this?

05:46.113 --> 05:47.981
Flowers from
a white person's garden.

05:48.015 --> 05:48.982
These are for you.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.718
For what?

05:50.751 --> 05:51.819
Because I love you.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.521
That look means:

05:53.554 --> 05:54.888
"Okay, what did you do?"

05:54.922 --> 05:56.924
Okay, what did you do?

05:56.957 --> 05:58.091
Not this.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.760
You got to get out
of here, Ashley.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.128
And give me
those flowers!

06:01.161 --> 06:04.131
Go, go, go, go, go!

06:04.164 --> 06:06.133
I didn't do anything.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.901
I'll get it.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.737
Uh-da-da-da-da-da.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.872
The machine will answer it.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.676
ROCHELLE:
Hello.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.911
Nobody is available
to take your call right now.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.013
Please leave a message
at the sound of the beep.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.185
I wonder who that was.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.454
Do you?

06:27.154 --> 06:29.156
Should we go upstairs?
No.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.825
Did you get fired
from your job, Daddy?
No.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.627
Did you get fired
from your other job?
No.

06:33.661 --> 06:34.662
Then who was that on the phone?

06:34.695 --> 06:35.929
I don't know.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.064
They didn't leave a message.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.766
Why not?
I don't know.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.968
Well, if nothing's wrong,
why are you bringing me flowers?

06:41.001 --> 06:44.004
I'm just trying to treat you the
way I would want to be treated

06:44.037 --> 06:45.439
if I was married to me.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.940
Now legal in California.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.009
Hmm.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.043
That's it?

06:50.077 --> 06:51.178
Yeah.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.946
Okay.

06:53.847 --> 06:54.815
Hey, so does anybody know

06:54.848 --> 06:56.750
a kid from around here
named Cleavon Barris?

06:56.784 --> 06:57.985
No, why?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.153
I got signed up for that Brother
from Another Mother program,

07:00.187 --> 07:02.022
and they said he lives
around here,
but I ain't never met him.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.758
Julius, do you
know of a child

07:04.792 --> 07:05.893
from another mother
around here named...

07:05.926 --> 07:08.228
Cleavon Barris? No.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.563
You remembered his name
pretty quick.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.864
TONYA:
Yeah, it'd be better

07:10.898 --> 07:11.832
to tell now if you do.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.000
I don't.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.702
I brought flowers
for your mother

07:14.735 --> 07:15.769
because I
love her.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.104
Is that so hard
to believe?

07:17.137 --> 07:18.806
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.041
And with that,
my father was the first man

07:21.074 --> 07:23.010
The Oprah Show
ever got in trouble.

07:23.043 --> 07:26.780
Meanwhile, finding
a black kid in Bed-Stuy

07:26.814 --> 07:29.650
was like trying to find
a needle in a needle stack.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.524
WOMAN:
James?

07:36.557 --> 07:37.625
James, who that
at the door?!

07:37.658 --> 07:38.425
James?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.060
Hey, Chris.
What you doing here?

07:40.093 --> 07:41.629
I'm looking for Cleavon Barris.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.931
WOMAN:
Close that door,
you hear me?!

07:43.964 --> 07:45.265
What you know about Cleavon?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.635
I'm supposed to be his Brother
from Another Mother.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.737
I used to know Cleavon,
back in the day.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.539
See, Cleavon,
he had some problems,

07:51.572 --> 07:53.841
but me, James,
I ain't have those problems.

07:53.874 --> 07:54.908
You hear what I'm saying?

07:54.942 --> 07:56.209
You're Cleavon?

07:56.243 --> 07:57.778
Hey, keep it down, man.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.279
My mother
must have

07:59.312 --> 08:01.849
signed me-- I mean, Cleavon--
up for it.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.851
But since I'm not Cleavon,
I ain't doing it.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.185
Well, the principal
signed me up

08:05.218 --> 08:06.587
so I got to do it.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.622
Well, that's between
you and Cleavon.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.891
And don't come back around here
looking for him no more.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.629
That's what Tupac does
every time somebody finds him.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.670
Just because James didn't want
a Brother from Another Mother,

08:22.703 --> 08:24.171
didn't mean he wasn't
going to get one.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.172
James.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.940
What you want?

08:26.974 --> 08:29.109
Look, I know you don't want
to do this any more than I do.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.611
But if we work together,

08:30.644 --> 08:32.012
we won't have to be
anywhere near each other.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.013
Worked for Shaq and Kobe.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.181
So what you
want me to do?

08:34.214 --> 08:35.716
Well, if anybody asks,

08:35.749 --> 08:37.150
you just say we were
with each other.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.952
That's clever.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.554
I ain't know you had it in you.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.189
I thought you were
a punk, a chump,

08:42.222 --> 08:43.757
a sissy, a
mama's boy...

08:43.791 --> 08:44.892
All right, all right.

08:44.925 --> 08:45.959
We got a deal?

08:45.993 --> 08:46.927
Deal.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.264
Vanessa's out for a week?

08:51.298 --> 08:53.066
I wonder why she didn't call me.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.168
Well, I tried calling you
last night to let you know

08:55.202 --> 08:57.905
I was filling in, but, um,
I must've had the wrong number,

08:57.938 --> 09:00.974
'cause some white lady answered
the phone, and I just hung up.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.943
Oh, no. That was me.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.613
See, we got a new
answering machine,

09:05.646 --> 09:06.914
and that's my phone voice.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.849
Phone voice, white voice.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.784
Same thing.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.153
Michael, what you doing here?

09:13.186 --> 09:14.822
I come to see my baby.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.023
Pam.

09:16.056 --> 09:16.957
Hmm?

09:16.990 --> 09:18.125
These are for you.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.160
Oh, so sweet.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.829
What are these for?

09:21.862 --> 09:24.164
I'm just trying to treat you
the way I would want

09:24.197 --> 09:26.967
to be treated if I was
trying to date me.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.670
Then why didn't you bring her
a greasy bucket of gizzards?

09:29.703 --> 09:32.139
That is the sweetest thing
I ever heard.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.642
I'm gonna see you later tonight
for dinner?
Mm-hmm.

09:34.675 --> 09:35.876
Smoked pork chop?
Mm-hmm.

09:35.909 --> 09:36.844
Everything?
Yeah.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.746
Mmm, sweet.
Hey, Chelle,

09:38.779 --> 09:40.313
tell Big Man I said

09:40.347 --> 09:42.249
"Big Man!"

09:42.282 --> 09:43.984
Don't forget the rice,
now, baby.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.389
Hi, everybody.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.325
Hi, Youngju.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.333
Oh.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.174
I'll see you later.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.914
More flowers.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.215
That's a coincidence.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.249
What did he say?

10:16.283 --> 10:20.087
He said he was just trying
to treat me the way

10:20.120 --> 10:22.823
he would want to be treated
if he was dating himself.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.358
The flowers are rigged
with explosives.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.860
No, no, no, no, no.

10:26.894 --> 10:27.961
That's one coincidence

10:27.995 --> 10:30.664
too many.

10:30.698 --> 10:33.233
Julius bought me flowers
and said the same thing

10:33.266 --> 10:34.968
that they said to y'all.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.137
I don't know what's
going on around here,

10:37.170 --> 10:40.340
but I guarantee you,
I'm about to find out.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.977
When my mother got suspicious,

10:44.011 --> 10:46.346
she never asked what
she wanted to know.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.415
She waited to see
what you would tell.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.117
What, no flowers today?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.686
You know, I don't want to do
the same thing every day.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.188
Yeah, that's right,
because if you were me,

10:55.222 --> 10:57.090
you wouldn't want them.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.058
Huh?

10:58.091 --> 10:59.159
Oh, that's what you said.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.694
It was very nice.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.230
Did you think of all of that
by yourself?

11:03.263 --> 11:05.232
Straight from the heart.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.800
And right in the back.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.135
I'll get it.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.302
No.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.004
Let the machine get it.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.340
Mind letting me
put the message on?

11:15.475 --> 11:17.811
Hi. Nobody's home
right now.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.080
Leave a message,
and we'll call you back.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.185
How come people keep calling
and not leaving messages?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.990
Hey, hey...

11:39.099 --> 11:41.134
Hey!

11:41.168 --> 11:43.003
What y'all doing here?

11:43.036 --> 11:45.072
We live here.
What are you doing here?

11:45.105 --> 11:47.274
Did you just pick our lock
with a credit card?

11:47.307 --> 11:49.176
And where did he get
a credit card?

11:49.209 --> 11:50.177
This?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.479
Nah. This was an accident.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.381
I thought this
was my house.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.316
You live across the street.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.284
Sorry, man.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.385
I'm dyslexic.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.820
Hey, um...

11:59.853 --> 12:01.288
I didn't mean
to interrupt.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.323
Just going to leave.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.892
You do that.

12:04.925 --> 12:09.296
Okay, Drew, after dinner,
you leave the message.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.065
Cool.

12:12.099 --> 12:15.168
While my father was keeping
Oprah from my mother,

12:15.202 --> 12:17.170
she was getting
to every other man in town.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.072
From the guys
who were white-collar...

12:19.106 --> 12:22.342
Stop it, y'all,
Oprah's on!

12:22.375 --> 12:24.511
...to guys who got collared.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.518
Every man in town
was watching Oprah.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.197
I guess that's a coincidence,
too.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.233
Meanwhile my father
wasn't the only one

12:46.266 --> 12:48.301
trying to keep something
undercover.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.237
Chris, just the man
I want to see.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.105
How are things going
with Cleavon?

12:52.139 --> 12:53.406
Cleavon?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.275
Oh, yeah, great.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.110
What kinds of things have
you been enjoying together?

12:57.144 --> 12:58.812
A lot of stuff.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.081
And the lying-through-your-
teeth award goes to...

13:01.114 --> 13:03.083
We worked on an art project
the other day.

13:06.519 --> 13:10.257
We also spent some time
with the disabled.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.999
And later on today,
we're going to go hang out

13:19.032 --> 13:20.267
with some neighborhood kids.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.270
Don't drop me please!
No, I'll pay, I swear!

13:23.303 --> 13:25.172
No, no, please!

13:25.205 --> 13:29.176
Let me go!
Let me go, please! I'll pay!

13:29.209 --> 13:32.012
Please, don't drop me!

13:32.045 --> 13:34.547
Well, that's great.
We can discuss it more
at your interview.

13:34.581 --> 13:38.085
You want us here together?

13:38.118 --> 13:39.386
3:00 p.m. See you tomorrow.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.289
No, he won't.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.962
I put the word out
on the street

13:48.996 --> 13:50.197
that I was looking for James,

13:50.230 --> 13:52.365
and, unfortunately,
the street answered back.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.366
Hey, Chris.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.338
He could have just said,
"Follow me."

14:00.540 --> 14:01.608
You wearing a wire?

14:01.641 --> 14:03.010
No!

14:03.043 --> 14:04.945
No one ever waits
for the answer

14:04.978 --> 14:05.946
before ripping your shirt open.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.015
Then why are you looking
for people then, man?

14:08.048 --> 14:10.117
What, you supposed
to be a detective?

14:10.150 --> 14:12.552
You Spenser for Hire,
Magnum PI?

14:12.585 --> 14:15.255
No, I just need James to come
with me to school tomorrow.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.257
It's for this Brother from
Another Mother program.

14:19.526 --> 14:23.063
Wait... didn't you used to be
Wayne Gretzky's bodyguard?

14:24.431 --> 14:26.499
James pays better.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.335
I thought we had
an understanding.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.337
We do. It's just that
the organization checks up.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.372
They want to talk to both
of us tomorrow in school.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.573
Like I said...

14:33.606 --> 14:35.108
next time you find me,

14:35.142 --> 14:36.609
you're gonna end up
getting found.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.645
James was tough,
but he was still 12.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.948
Listen here, little boy,
I ain't got time for this.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.983
You don't show up at school
with me tomorrow,

14:43.016 --> 14:44.084
I'm gonna call
your mother.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.185
All right, man. Dag.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.188
While I was getting James
to step up,

14:48.221 --> 14:49.990
my mother was getting
the lowdown.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.694
* Yo, this is Master Drew
and I'm not home *

14:54.727 --> 14:57.364
* So call me back
on the telephone. *

15:00.667 --> 15:03.236
Hey, little dude's father
from across the street,

15:03.270 --> 15:05.172
I just saw Oprah today.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.340
You were right:
that's a bad woman.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.342
Anyway, I'll talk to you later.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.482
Look, I don't know what
he's going to ask us,

15:15.515 --> 15:17.050
so let me take the lead.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.318
Whatever I say,
just agree.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.287
Chill out, man.
Got this.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.424
Cleavon?

15:24.457 --> 15:26.593
Oh, hello, Mr. Perkins.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.360
Oh, take a seat, Chris.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.196
I'll be out
for you in a bit.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.264
Wait, we're not going
in together?

15:31.298 --> 15:33.400
No. I take you in
one at a time--

15:33.433 --> 15:35.335
make sure you're doing
the things you say you're doing.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.643
Whatever questions
they ask James,

15:43.676 --> 15:45.378
I hope I had the same answers,

15:45.412 --> 15:47.147
or I was going
to have to answer

15:47.180 --> 15:48.581
a whole other set of questions.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.987
Oh, Chris.

15:54.021 --> 15:54.954
From what Cleavon tells me,

15:54.988 --> 15:56.556
you two are what the program
is all about.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.091
Fraud and deception?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.059
We are?

15:59.092 --> 16:00.360
Yeah, man.
We are.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.561
Anyway,

16:01.594 --> 16:03.196
here are the flyers
for the carnival.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.197
It's a fundraiser.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.299
The donors like to see
the brothers together.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.335
It's a big photo op,
so I'll need you both there.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.502
Okay, we'll be there.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.471
Keep up the good work, boys.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.742
We take your little
buddy photo and that's it.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.577
After that, I'm done.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.412
He wasn't the only one.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.683
Hey, baby.

16:23.716 --> 16:24.984
Who the hell is Oprah?

16:25.018 --> 16:27.587
That was the last time
those words were ever spoken.

16:27.620 --> 16:28.788
Baby, I...

16:28.821 --> 16:30.523
Uh-uh.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.560
Before you explain,
I want you to listen

16:33.593 --> 16:34.694
so we're very clear on

16:34.727 --> 16:37.530
what you need to tell me.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.099
JEROME:
Hey,

16:39.132 --> 16:40.767
little dude's father
from across the street,

16:40.800 --> 16:42.402
man, I just saw Oprah today.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.771
You were right:
that's a bad woman.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.306
Anyway, I'll talk to you later.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.378
Baby, Oprah is a talk show host.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.049
You're supposed to be
working two jobs

16:56.083 --> 16:58.385
and sleeping during the day.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.520
Exactly when do you have time
and where do you go

17:00.553 --> 17:02.689
to meet this talk show ho

17:02.722 --> 17:05.358
I don't know her.
I-I watch her.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.626
She's in Chicago.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.761
She's on every day.

17:08.795 --> 17:09.796
Look.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.364
Every day.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.300
See?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.670
Okay.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.805
What's in the bag?

17:18.838 --> 17:21.441
I'm throwing out your makeup.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.376
You're doing what?!

17:23.410 --> 17:25.278
Oprah said you don't have
to paint your face for me.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.413
I love you just the way you are.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.616
Oprah doesn't know what
I look like without my makeup!

17:29.649 --> 17:30.717
And neither does my father.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.786
Julius, baby,

17:33.820 --> 17:35.255
do you know what's in this bag?

17:35.855 --> 17:37.624
Rochelle is in this bag!

17:37.657 --> 17:39.659
See, here's
Rochelle's lips,

17:39.692 --> 17:42.529
here's her eyelashes,
her complexion,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.697
her cheeks, her fingernails!

17:44.731 --> 17:47.100
Julius,

17:47.134 --> 17:49.569
I don't know
what Oprah's saying,

17:49.602 --> 17:53.340
but she's giving out
very dangerous information.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.708
Baby, there are
certain things

17:55.742 --> 17:58.745
that men just don't need
to know about women.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.113
Like everything.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.714
I'm sorry.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.717
I just wanted to let you know
you're good enough for me.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.553
Even if your face
is inside this bag.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.255
Thank you.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.490
I appreciate that.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.260
Baby, you really want
to do something for me?

18:13.293 --> 18:14.794
Anything.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.596
Stop watching Oprah.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.732
That's how Oprah's audience
turned from

18:19.766 --> 18:22.602
all men to all women.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.573
And that's how the message on
our answering machine became...

18:26.606 --> 18:27.840
JULIUS:
We're not home right now.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.542
Leave a message after the beep.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.587
Hey, Jerome.
Hey!

18:40.620 --> 18:41.721
Man, I-I was just...

18:41.754 --> 18:43.190
I know what you were doing.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.624
Just take the answering machine
and get out.

18:50.663 --> 18:54.334
He still came back later
to try and steal the TV.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.606
While my father was getting
our answering machine stolen,

18:59.639 --> 19:01.641
I was getting my picture taken.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.410
I'm so proud.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.713
Every single one of you
completed his community service.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.847
Way to go, Chris.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.682
The ghetto
owes you one.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.518
Okay, big smile.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.922
All right, everybody,
go have fun!

19:21.628 --> 19:23.763
James.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.632
You know you can stay
for a while if you want to.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.499
What for?

19:26.533 --> 19:28.368
It's a carnival. It's fun.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.902
It's not like we got them
on the block.

19:29.936 --> 19:30.970
After all was said and done,

19:31.003 --> 19:33.340
I found out a few things
about James.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.342
His real name was Cleavon.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.909
He was raised by the streets.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.379
And he was still
a 12-year-old kid.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.947
All right, man, dag.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.350
You act like you're
my big brother for real.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.385
And I'm not petting
no farm animals.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.919
He was also allergic to goats.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.389
Hey, this was
pretty cool.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.823
Cool.

19:50.857 --> 19:51.991
Look what I got.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.560
Man, you won that?

19:53.593 --> 19:55.862
I didn't say
I won it.

19:55.895 --> 19:59.399
I said I got it.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.567
Here.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.502
This for you.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.538
Thanks.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.374
At that moment,

20:07.407 --> 20:09.842
I thought that
deep down James was

20:09.876 --> 20:12.679
a decent person who had a good
shot of making it in life.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.347
That's him!

20:14.381 --> 20:15.482
The one with
the jacket.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.583
I thought wrong.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.422
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.358
