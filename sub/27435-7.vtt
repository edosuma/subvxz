WEBVTT

00:07.960 --> 00:08.995
Merriam!

00:19.280 --> 00:21.180
Damn it.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.276
Merriam!

00:24.020 --> 00:25.669
Rosa,
where the hell's Merriam?

00:25.720 --> 00:27.847
You okay, Mr. Bob?
No, I'm not okay.

00:27.890 --> 00:30.711
I need my inhaler.
What's going on?

00:30.760 --> 00:32.409
He's having trouble again.
I don't know what
the hell's wrong.

00:32.460 --> 00:34.849
I can't get my breath.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.414
Is it your chest?
Rosa, I found another one.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.074
It's that feeling again,
that damn scratching,

00:39.120 --> 00:40.678
like my breath...

00:40.730 --> 00:41.947
Ifeel...

00:50.520 --> 00:52.078
I can't...

00:54.220 --> 00:55.528
Oh, no! Bob!

00:57.530 --> 00:58.781
NURSE 1: He's in
respiratory distress.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.909
Obstruction of the
lower airway.

00:59.970 --> 01:01.187
NURSE 2: We've ruled
out anaphylaxis?

01:01.230 --> 01:02.447
Correct. No known
medical allergies.

01:02.490 --> 01:03.969
Wife said he was ill
with shortness of breath.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.885
Tell OR 8
we're on our way.

01:05.930 --> 01:07.488
Nasotracheal intubation?

01:07.540 --> 01:09.588
We don't have time.
We need to establish
an airway.

01:09.630 --> 01:11.757
SpOZ approaching 80%.
Let's open his cricothyroid.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.107
I want_ to avoid
hIS cerwcal spIne.

01:53.720 --> 01:58.157
Yesterday morning,
a bio-tech company executive
met a gruesome death.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.839
Yeah. I'm not
playing this game.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.242
I'm giving you a case.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.633
You're giving me
a lead for you

02:04.680 --> 02:08.241
so that you can keep on doing
whatever it is you're doing.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.552
I'm picking a jury
of my peers.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.648
Wouldn't that be
a colorful lot.

02:12.690 --> 02:14.294
You gave us The Pharmacist

02:14.350 --> 02:16.955
so that Dembe could get
five minutes alone with him.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.437
You asked for a psych eval
so you'd be sent
to a mental-health facility

02:21.480 --> 02:22.822
where someone
you needed to see
was a patient.

02:22.880 --> 02:26.008
If you're accusing me
of using the Task Force

02:26.050 --> 02:28.575
to assist me in avoiding
the hangman's noose,

02:28.620 --> 02:29.791
guilty as charged.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.057
I want to help you,

02:31.100 --> 02:32.533
but I can't if
you don't tell me

02:32.580 --> 02:33.660
what it is you're doing.

02:33.710 --> 02:36.452
I'm fighting for my life.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.229
And you are helping
more than you know.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.282
Why can't you just
be honest with me?

02:42.590 --> 02:45.411
You remind me so much
of your mother.

02:45.460 --> 02:48.509
I don't remember if I've ever
told you that before, have I?

02:48.550 --> 02:52.077
There are a lot of things
you haven't told me.

02:52.120 --> 02:55.817
I'm here because someone
betrayed me, someone close.

02:56.820 --> 02:58.868
Under the circumstances,

02:58.910 --> 03:00.514
it's hard to know
who to trust.

03:03.050 --> 03:06.178
Okay.
Tell me about the case.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.838
What do you know about
entomological warfare?

03:11.230 --> 03:12.788
For over 1,000 years,

03:12.840 --> 03:15.092
human beings have been
weaponizing insects.

03:15.150 --> 03:19.052
In the 12th century,
wasps nests were catapulted
into enemy towns.

03:19.110 --> 03:22.273
During the Cold War,
the Pentagon developed plans

03:22.330 --> 03:24.798
to produce 100 million
yellow fever-infected
mosquitoes

03:24.850 --> 03:26.454
per month.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.455
And the most notorious
Japanese war criminal

03:28.510 --> 03:30.671
in World War II
was General Shiro,

03:30.730 --> 03:33.597
who bred bub_onic
plague-carrying
insects

03:33.640 --> 03:35.983
that killed
tens of thousands
of Chinese.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.644
Did Reddington give you a case
or a history lesson?

03:37.690 --> 03:39.123
A bit of both.

03:39.170 --> 03:40.819
A year ago, a patent attorney

03:40.870 --> 03:42.690
was found suffocated
In hIS office.

03:42.740 --> 03:45.300
Why? An infestation
of deadly beetles

03:45.350 --> 03:48.046
had eaten the lining
of his lungs.

03:48.090 --> 03:50.911
Ew.
And six months ago,

03:50.960 --> 03:52.700
it was a chemical
manufacturer's turn,

03:52.750 --> 03:55.480
and yesterday, the head
of a bio-tech company.

03:55.530 --> 03:57.578
Eaten from the inside
by killer beetles.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.531
Apparently,
and according to Reddington,

03:59.580 --> 04:01.889
they were put there
by a modern-day General Shiro.

04:01.930 --> 04:03.978
Am I right in assuming
this case has something

04:04.020 --> 04:05.100
to do with his defense?

04:06.850 --> 04:08.761
Our immunity deal
with Reddington
has been invalidated.

04:08.810 --> 04:10.630
He stands accused
of treason.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.591
Is this your periodic reminder
that by working with him,

04:12.640 --> 04:14.631
we may be viewed
as aiding and abetting?

04:14.680 --> 04:16.682
COOPER: It's a possibility,
especially if we pursue cases

04:16.730 --> 04:19.642
in which his agenda is,
to be polite, obscure.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.204
We're all in,
if that's what you're asking.

04:22.260 --> 04:25.218
COOPER: Samar, Aram,
look into what connects
the victims.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.511
The man
who died yesterday...

04:26.570 --> 04:29.175
Bob Lockemy,
founder of Lockemy Technology.

04:29.220 --> 04:30.653
Go to the ME,
see what he can tell you

04:30.700 --> 04:33.521
about the weaponized insects
that killed him.

04:33.570 --> 04:35.743
SIMA: Your Honor,
we agree with Mr. Reddington.

04:35.790 --> 04:38.008
Jury questionnaires
can be sent
to potential Jurors

04:38.060 --> 04:39.391
prior to jury selection,

04:39.450 --> 04:42.578
but he wants to ask
382 questions,

04:42.630 --> 04:45.758
most of which require
essay answers.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.791
It would take jurors
days to complete.

04:47.850 --> 04:50.102
REDDINGTON: I'm sorry
if you find the process

04:50.150 --> 04:54.325
of selecting a fair jury
to be inconvenient, Mr. Sima,

04:54.380 --> 04:57.895
but you are trying to kill me
for a crime I didn't commit.

04:57.940 --> 04:59.760
The problem is not
inconvenience.

04:59.820 --> 05:03.551
It's relevance.
Example, question 133.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.819
I quote,
"Compare and contrast
the role of memory

05:06.870 --> 05:09.509
"in the works of Proust
and Dickens, with examples."

05:09.570 --> 05:12.380
How can I sensibly judge
one's character

05:12.440 --> 05:14.908
if I don't know their views
on great literature?

05:14.960 --> 05:16.439
This is absurd.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.264
In case you haven't read
a newspaper recently,

05:18.310 --> 05:20.744
Mr. Sima, all of our lives
are playing out

05:20.790 --> 05:23.133
in the theater of the absurd
these days.

05:23.190 --> 05:26.057
Your Honor,
I believe the prosecution

05:26.100 --> 05:29.399
wants to intentionally
dumb down the jury
questionnaire

05:29.450 --> 05:31.839
because he wants
to attract dumb jurors

05:31.890 --> 05:35.974
because Mr. Sima wants
a jury of unsophisticated,

05:36.030 --> 05:40.069
unthinking sheep who will
blindly convict me of treason

05:40.120 --> 05:42.588
_out_of some_
mingIded notion

05:42.640 --> 05:44.983
that it's the patriotic
thing to do.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.032
I, on the other hand,
want astute jurors,

05:48.080 --> 05:50.071
people
who can understand

05:50.130 --> 05:53.566
the somewhat complicated
evidence I plan to present,

05:53.610 --> 05:57.250
capable of evaluating
not only my motives,

05:57.310 --> 05:58.607
but also those
of the government.

05:58.660 --> 06:00.651
The literature question
is stricken.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.304
Excellent.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.965
That sort of bias
will only aid in my appeal

06:05.010 --> 06:07.797
should the government win
in this round of play.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.661
We also object
to question 134,

06:10.710 --> 06:12.883
"Who is your favorite
classical composer?"

06:12.930 --> 06:16.673
Okay, I will not be judged
by anyone who likes Schumann.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.156
I refuse to be
sent to my death
by Philistines.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.542
JUDGE WILKINS:
I love Schumann.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.285
Fantasie in C Major
was played

06:23.330 --> 06:24.547
at my mother's funeral
this past summer.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.466
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:27.510 --> 06:30.729
Mr. Reddington, 40 questions
should be sufficient.

06:30.780 --> 06:34.648
No essays, keep it simple,
and don't waste my time.

06:34.690 --> 06:36.567
RESSLER: Dr. Maguire,
thanks for meeting with us.

06:36.610 --> 06:38.919
So, what do you have?

06:38.960 --> 06:42.999
It appears that
your victim suffocated.

06:43.050 --> 06:44.438
On insects?

06:44.490 --> 06:46.355
Best I could tell,
some kind of water beetle.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.130
Apparently, they're scavengers
and fierce predators,

06:49.190 --> 06:50.578
but what
I don't understand

06:50.620 --> 06:52.440
is how the larva
were able to survwe

06:52.490 --> 06:54.572
in his digestive enzymes
and stomach acids.

06:54.630 --> 06:56.052
I'm sorry. I thought
you said he suffocated.

06:56.110 --> 06:57.793
That is the official
cause of death,

06:57.850 --> 06:59.499
but I found
larval remnants

06:59.540 --> 07:01.542
in his stomach wall
and digestive tract,

07:01.590 --> 07:03.808
which suggests that he
may have ingested them.

07:03.850 --> 07:06.808
_These creatures were
literally feeding on him,

07:06.860 --> 07:08.418
eaﬁng
from the inside out.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.279
My guess
is that they migrated

07:10.340 --> 07:12.160
into his bronchial tubes
and lungs,

07:12.210 --> 07:14.462
and the incision
in the neck,

07:14.520 --> 07:17.603
well, that simply provided
an escape hatch.

07:17.650 --> 07:19.959
Just a guess.
I'm not an expert in insects.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.082
You probably should
talk to an entomologist.

07:22.130 --> 07:24.041
Know anyone
you can recommend?

07:24.090 --> 07:27.264
Not personally, but I do know
that Dr. Jonathan Nikkila,

07:27.310 --> 07:29.870
he worked
at the same company
as your victim.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.615
If there's anyone who can
help you find the person

07:31.660 --> 07:33.708
who did this,
well, I'm sure he can.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.309
"The government wouldn't spend
the time charging someone

08:50.350 --> 08:53.524
_ "with treason
if they were innocent."

08:53.570 --> 08:56.038
"Innocent" is misspelled,
by the way,

08:56.100 --> 08:59.615
and the apostrophe
is misplaced
in "wouldn't."

08:59.660 --> 09:01.708
None of these answers
instill me

09:01.750 --> 09:03.832
with great confidence
in our jury pool.

09:03.890 --> 09:04.959
We'll find
the right people.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.012
Thanks.

09:08.060 --> 09:11.848
Why is it that spiritual
advisers such as yourself

09:11.890 --> 09:15.849
are always so insistently
optimistic?

09:15.900 --> 09:19.415
Just once I'd like to hear
a man of the cloth say,
"Yep, this sucks."

09:20.990 --> 09:24.164
Dembe, we need a juror
I can count on,

09:24.210 --> 09:28.203
one person capable
of convincing the others
to vote not guilty.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.739
The jurors
are chosen randomly.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.828
Yes, from the registered
voter logs,

09:31.870 --> 09:35.658
the IRS, and the Department
of Motor Vehicles.

09:39.310 --> 09:42.484
Fortunately,
we have a friend at the DMV.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.663
Dembe! Come in.
Good to see you,
old friend.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.587
Ah! I'd shake,
but I got "sandwich hands."

09:56.810 --> 09:57.845
Thank you for seeing me.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.197
No sweat off my sack.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.319
Anything for you
and the old man.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.109
How's he holding up,
anyway?

10:02.160 --> 10:04.071
It's not good.
Is it the food?

10:04.120 --> 10:06.293
Gulping down government cheese
and dishwater stew...

10:06.340 --> 10:09.161
Egh. It's enough to make
a man want to go vegan.

10:09.210 --> 10:11.428
We have a situation you may be
able to help us with.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.345
It's the jury pool.

10:13.390 --> 10:15.824
Raymond needs people
who would be agreeable
to him.

10:15.870 --> 10:17.781
I could go to jail
for that.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.912
If he's found guilty, they'll
try and put him to death.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.485
When you say it like that...

10:22.530 --> 10:26.091
You have access to the voter
logs via the DMV records.

10:26.140 --> 10:29.052
Raymond needs to know
if you can access the logs,

10:29.100 --> 10:31.352
put a friend
on the panel.

10:31.410 --> 10:33.014
Can you make that happen?

10:33.060 --> 10:34.448
I've got friends.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.280
Little Robbie Funkhauser
in the Big Apple office.

10:39.330 --> 10:44.029
Uh, there's Yaling in IT,
who carries a bit of
a torch for me.

10:45.940 --> 10:47.817
Let me poke around a bit,
see what I can do.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.816
Do it quietly.
What about me, Dembe?

10:49.860 --> 10:51.987
This is just
"between friends."

10:52.040 --> 10:55.294
Tell the big man
to hang in there, hmm?

10:55.350 --> 10:57.739
Jelly Bean's
got his back.

10:59.130 --> 11:00.654
Serious.

11:02.130 --> 11:03.745
LIZ: Thank you
for helping us.

11:03.790 --> 11:06.395
DR. NIKKILA: Of course.
Bob was like a mentor to me.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.396
I am devastated
by the news.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.918
Did you have a chance to look
at what the ME sent over?

11:10.970 --> 11:14.053
I have,
and it's terrifying.

11:17.540 --> 11:20.839
You are looking at
a genetically modified version

11:20.890 --> 11:24.360
of a predacious diving beetle
known as the Dytiscidae.

11:24.420 --> 11:26.069
Predacious?
Predatory.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.112
There are over 4,000 types
of carnivorous beetles.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.468
But none that prey
on humans?

11:30.510 --> 11:31.852
Not naturally, no,

11:31.900 --> 11:33.948
but nothing about what
happened to Bob was natural.

11:33.990 --> 11:37.118
The gestation period of the
Dytiscidae is at least a week,

11:37.170 --> 11:39.775
and there's no reason_
the larvae should've survwed

11:39.820 --> 11:42.823
inside his body for that long
after the eggs had hatched.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.918
But that's what the medical
examiner said happened.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.564
I can't explain it.

11:46.610 --> 11:48.874
All I know is that someone
made alterations.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.354
Those are its jaws.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.449
By my math, they are
four times normal size.

11:54.490 --> 11:56.048
Talk about weaponized.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.352
But why go to the trouble
to make a super bug?

11:58.410 --> 12:01.402
I mean,
there are easier ways
to kill people.

12:01.450 --> 12:03.361
Well, not if you
want to be ironic.

12:03.410 --> 12:06.106
He sent a bug to kill
a bug killer.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.458
Lockemy Technologies
made pesticides.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.989
Powerful ones.
Like Hexapene,

12:10.030 --> 12:12.339
which I developed
when I worked there.

12:12.380 --> 12:15.816
It was designed for use
after natural disasters
like hurricanes

12:15.860 --> 12:17.555
when the standing
waters left behind

12:17.600 --> 12:20.774
could breed potentially
disease-infected insects.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.253
Some people thought
it was too powerful,

12:22.300 --> 12:24.120
so it was not approved
for commercial use,

12:24.170 --> 12:25.603
but I still got
death threats.

12:25.650 --> 12:27.254
For killing
diseased bugs?

12:27.310 --> 12:28.607
You sound very rational,

12:28.660 --> 12:30.218
but in
the environmental world,

12:30.270 --> 12:32.784
that type of thinking
is in short supply.

12:32.830 --> 12:35.298
So you think someone
from the environmental
community

12:35.360 --> 12:36.702
targeted Lockemy?

12:36.750 --> 12:39.401
I was
a lowly technician.
Bob was the CEO.

12:39.450 --> 12:41.350
If I got death threats,
I'm sure he did, too.

12:41.410 --> 12:43.924
We've been led to
believe that our killer
fashions himself

12:43.980 --> 12:46.050
as a latter-day
General Shiro.

12:46.110 --> 12:47.839
Does _that mean
anything to you?

12:47.890 --> 12:50.711
General Shiro
was a war criminal,

12:50.770 --> 12:53.238
but his knowledge of how
to weaponize the insect world

12:53.290 --> 12:55.804
was so great that instead
of executing him,

12:55.860 --> 12:59.421
the Allies hired him
to teach us how to
wage bio-war.

12:59.470 --> 13:03.201
If the man you are looking for
fashions himself after Shiro,

13:03.260 --> 13:06.957
it means to get
his point across,

13:07.000 --> 13:10.174
he doesn't care
how many people he kills.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.256
Hexapene is what connects
the three victims.

13:12.310 --> 13:14.130
Lockemy ran the company
that developed it,

13:14.180 --> 13:16.648
Steiner was the attorney
he hired to patent it,

13:16.700 --> 13:18.748
and Helfrich
was the chemist he used

13:18.790 --> 13:20.439
to manufacture
the pesticide.

13:20.490 --> 13:23.095
Nikkila told us Hexapene
wasn't approved for
commercial use.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.493
Not yet, but according
to a recent SEC filing,

13:25.540 --> 13:28.407
Lockemy was lobbying Congress
and the FDA for approval.

13:28.450 --> 13:31.066
And now someone's killed
everyone involved
in making that happen.

13:31.110 --> 13:34.625
I got something.
This is Lockemy's calendar.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.989
Business meetings, speeches,
lunches he'd scheduled,

13:37.030 --> 13:39.635
including one
he had a week ago
with Dick Kendel.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.238
Wait.
The clean air guy?

13:41.290 --> 13:43.372
The clean air guy,
the clean water guy.

13:43.430 --> 13:45.682
_ In the _
enVIronmental community,
he is the guy,

13:45.730 --> 13:47.869
and his current crusade,
leading the fight

13:47.910 --> 13:49.775
to ban pesticides
like Hexapene.

13:49.820 --> 13:50.866
COOPER: Kendel is a lobbyist.

13:50.910 --> 13:52.468
Maybe he had lunch
with Lockemy

13:52.520 --> 13:54.078
so he could lobby him
to change his mind.

13:54.130 --> 13:56.598
Maybe, but he did have lunch
with him a week ago.

13:56.660 --> 13:58.560
So?

13:58.620 --> 14:01.748
So Dr. Nikkila told us
the gestation period
for these bugs is a week.

14:01.790 --> 14:03.007
Which means
a week ago,

14:03.050 --> 14:05.098
our killer found a way
to get Lockemy

14:05.140 --> 14:07.279
to eat or drink their way
into his system.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.312
What better way
to do that than at a
power lunch on K Street?

14:10.370 --> 14:12.053
COOPER: Find Kendel,
bring him in.

14:12.110 --> 14:14.931
Looks like we found
our latter-day General Shiro.

14:18.850 --> 14:20.806
GLEN: What about this broad?
Fay Macmannis.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.589
She's a registered
Libertarian.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.596
They're always
"hear no evil,
see no evil."

14:24.640 --> 14:25.629
Put her in the maybe pile.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.557
What about Marlene Sucha?

14:28.600 --> 14:31.467
Carnegie Hi|| address.
Salmon pants territory.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.296
Blue blazers, family crests,
treslaw and order.

14:34.350 --> 14:35.601
Pass.

14:37.570 --> 14:40.869
WOMAN: D-22. Window W.

14:40.920 --> 14:44.174
D-22. Window W to your right.

14:44.230 --> 14:46.573
What?
I was thinking,
with your access

14:46.620 --> 14:49.703
to the big man's
finances, uh...

14:49.750 --> 14:51.479
You know, never mind.
Badidea.

14:51.540 --> 14:52.757
What's a bad idea?

14:52.800 --> 14:54.233
Doesn't matter.
It's stupid.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.674
What if we leave him?

15:04.720 --> 15:06.199
Leave who?

15:06.250 --> 15:08.548
Reddington.
I mean, let him rot.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.854
With your access to his money
and my connections,

15:11.910 --> 15:13.559
we could clean him out,
vanish.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.295
That's a terrible idea.

15:15.340 --> 15:16.773
Unless it's not.

15:16.820 --> 15:18.515
We let him think we tried,
did everything we could,

15:18.560 --> 15:20.209
but it didn't work.

15:20.260 --> 15:22.080
Reddington takes a ride
on the pale horse,

15:22.130 --> 15:24.348
we abscond with the dough,
50/50 split.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.039
40/60, whatever
you think is fair.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.399
Point is, you and I
are great together.

15:30.450 --> 15:32.748
You can feel that.
I know you can.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.882
Like brothers
from another mother.

15:34.930 --> 15:37.148
The White Stripes.
The Black Keys.

15:37.190 --> 15:39.977
African-American.

15:40.020 --> 15:43.148
Dembe, you and I could do
great things together.

15:46.900 --> 15:50.154
I'm screwin' with you.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.723
You think I'm nuts?
He'd kill us both.

15:51.770 --> 15:53.419
You should've
seen your face.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.028
We have to find someone.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.776
Yeah, yeah, after lunch.
I am starving.

15:57.820 --> 16:00.687
Dying for one of those
teriyaki bowls, extra cabbage.

16:00.740 --> 16:02.901
_You want one?
Didn't you just eat?

16:02.960 --> 16:04.769
Don't worry.
We'll figure it out.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.650
Unless you want to let
the old man rot.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.089
I'm only kidding!

16:09.140 --> 16:10.869
But not really.
Either way, think about it.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.262
I'll get an extra
teriyaki bowl.

16:12.310 --> 16:14.050
You'll thank me later.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.587
Mr. Kendel, FBI.
Open up, please.

16:26.550 --> 16:27.414
Do you hear that?

16:29.290 --> 16:31.246
What is that?
I don't hear anything.

16:33.070 --> 16:34.025
Mr. Kendel?

16:35.510 --> 16:36.249
Hello?

16:38.510 --> 16:40.034
Maybe we're too late.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.388
Maybe he killed Lockemy
and fled.

16:43.430 --> 16:44.863
Maybe not.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.351
Mr. Kendel?

17:11.160 --> 17:12.934
So much for finding
our killer.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.336
LIZ: This doesn't
make any sense.

17:25.390 --> 17:28.120
Lockemy, Steiner,
and Helfrich lobbied
to make Hexapene legal.

17:28.170 --> 17:29.899
Kendel lobbied to
keep it illegal.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.689
Why would someone who kills
people because he hates

17:31.740 --> 17:34.470
the pesticides they make kill
someone who hates pesticides?

17:34.530 --> 17:36.339
Did the ME establish
a time of death?

17:36.400 --> 17:38.561
Both men died within
an hour of each other.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.702
So, we thought Kendel
poisoned Lockemy at lunch,

17:40.750 --> 17:43.059
but it turns out someone else
p0isoned them both.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.146
COOPER:
We'll worry about why later.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.487
Right now,
all that matters is who.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.053
Our only lead
is the restaurant.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.146
Get there and see
what you can find.

17:50.190 --> 17:52.363
Written answers
havmg been given,

17:52.410 --> 17:55.106
we will now proceed
to in-person interviews.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.196
Given this
is a death-penalty case,

17:57.250 --> 18:00.117
each side has
20 peremptory challenges.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.379
Does defense counsel
understand the nature
of such challenges?

18:03.430 --> 18:05.819
Yes, Your Honor.
It means that by the
time the jury is seated,

18:05.860 --> 18:07.509
there won't be
a Schumann lover
in the bunch.

18:08.690 --> 18:10.123
This should be fun.

18:11.350 --> 18:13.693
Treason is pissing
on our flag,

18:13.740 --> 18:15.469
going against our own people.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.829
Anybody who does
that deserves to die,
in my opinion.

18:17.870 --> 18:19.303
I'd pull the trigger myself.

18:19.350 --> 18:21.227
We'll certainly keep you
in mind for that.

18:21.270 --> 18:23.170
So, you're a professor
of criminal psychology.

18:23.230 --> 18:25.573
Are you confident
that you could be impartial

18:25.620 --> 18:27.224
in assessing the evidence
in this case?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.623
I am. In fact,
I have been before.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.831
My sister was the victim
of a violent crime.

18:31.890 --> 18:33.972
Yes, I'm a veteran.
Two tours in Iraq.

18:34.020 --> 18:35.100
Thank you
for your service.

18:35.150 --> 18:37.232
If a man's broken a law,
he's broken a law.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.633
Ain't no way around it.
It's why we got laws, anyway.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.375
But you could bring
back a verdict

18:41.420 --> 18:43.149
without fear or prejudice?

18:43.200 --> 18:45.111
Of course I could, yes.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.594
REDDINGTON: Your Honor,
I'd ask that this juror
be dismissed for cause.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.720
Grounds?

18:48.770 --> 18:50.818
A close member of her family
was victimized by crime.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.293
I think it's reasonable
to question

18:52.340 --> 18:53.739
her ability to be
impartial.

18:53.780 --> 18:55.771
She just said
she could be fair-minded.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.252
And I'm sure
she believes that.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.380
Your motion to strike
for cause is denied.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.045
If you have concerns,
you can use one of the few

19:02.090 --> 19:03.432
peremptory strikes
you have left.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.094
No, thank you, Your Honor.
MAN 1: It's simple.

19:05.140 --> 19:07.267
MAN: If more people
were executed,
maybe the death penalty

19:07.320 --> 19:08.389
would work the way
it should work

19:08.450 --> 19:10.486
and criminals just might
think twice.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.485
Your Honor, I'd give a dozen
strikes to dismiss this juror.

19:12.540 --> 19:14.440
I put my life on the line
to defend this country.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.058
Friends of mine
have died for it.

19:16.110 --> 19:18.749
So, yeah, if this guy's
guilty of betraying the US,

19:18.800 --> 19:20.540
I think capital punishment
is appropriate.

19:20.590 --> 19:21.978
Respectfully,
I move to strike for cause.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.418
Because he's a veteran?
No,

19:23.460 --> 19:25.018
because it appears
he already thinks I'm guilty.

19:25.070 --> 19:26.765
He said
"if" you're guilty.

19:26.810 --> 19:29.153
How long have I been with
the ACLU? 28 years.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.723
I'm a card-carrying member.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.941
Would you care
to see the card?

19:31.990 --> 19:34.038
That won't be necessary.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.900
Your Honor, this juror
is acceptable to the defense.

19:35.950 --> 19:38.339
But not the prosecution.
Peremptory strike, Your Honor.

19:38.390 --> 19:39.994
Move to strike. _
Your Honor, please strike.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.122
Strike, Your Honor.
MAN: Truth is,
I detest any form

19:42.180 --> 19:44.910
of political correctness,
conventional wisdom,
or government intrusion.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.564
Do you believe
in the rule of law?

19:46.620 --> 19:49.009
The best and the brightest
should rule, not the law.

19:49.050 --> 19:51.189
Your Honor,
the defense accepts
and welcomes this juror.

19:51.230 --> 19:52.265
Move to strike.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.569
So, you like pugs.

19:57.970 --> 19:59.619
No, I love pugs.

19:59.670 --> 20:02.230
Even with all the scratching
and the wheezing,

20:02.280 --> 20:04.100
the drooling
and the gassiness?

20:04.150 --> 20:06.630
That is a myth.
Pugs don't suffer...

20:06.680 --> 20:08.671
I think you love them
because they suffer.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.982
Perhaps because you suffer.

20:12.030 --> 20:15.158
This is jury selection,
Mr. Reddington,
not group therapy.

20:15.210 --> 20:18.202
Your Honor, this juror said
she favors the death penalty

20:18.260 --> 20:20.160
and that her husband
was a cop.

20:20.210 --> 20:22.599
With all due respect,
she certainly qualifies

20:22.650 --> 20:24.823
as an obvious dismissal
on my part.

20:24.870 --> 20:26.428
I'm aware of that.
I'm also aware

20:26.480 --> 20:29.131
that you are out
of peremptory challenges.

20:29.180 --> 20:32.308
You may strike
subsequent jurors
for good cause only,

20:32.360 --> 20:35.705
and loving pugs
isn't cause.

20:35.750 --> 20:38.708
Ah, well, you see, but it is.
It's cause for hope.

20:38.750 --> 20:42.572
Only people with
a healthy dose of empathy

20:42.630 --> 20:46.100
are capable of caring
for beasts with such deficits.

20:46.150 --> 20:47.845
Did you just call
my pugs beasts?

20:47.890 --> 20:49.494
That's what some
people see.

20:49.550 --> 20:51.154
You clearly see
something else.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.543
I know what I see,
and I don't like it.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.204
Give it time.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.559
I've been known
to wheeze and scratch.

20:57.600 --> 21:01.593
I prefer not to discuss
the drool and the flatulence.

21:01.650 --> 21:04.346
Your Honor, this juror
is acceptable to the defense.

21:04.390 --> 21:05.948
Good to know,
because I'm seating her.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.774
Ma'am, you may be excused.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.388
Call the next juror.

21:13.700 --> 21:17.659
Okay, here I am.
Ready to serve!

21:17.710 --> 21:19.314
Ahh!

21:19.360 --> 21:20.964
Okay,
who's got questions?

21:22.490 --> 21:25.368
Y-Your Honor, we've been at
this for several hours now.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.492
Might we take
our mid-morning break?

21:27.540 --> 21:30.452
I'm feeling
a little unwell.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.196
Just 15 minutes
till I get my legs back.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.982
Very well.
We shall be in recess.

21:41.340 --> 21:43.945
SCHMOCK: Poisoned?
While eating here?

21:43.990 --> 21:46.424
We believe so, yes.
They had lunch
here a week ago.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.609
Yeah, I-I don't
remember them.

21:48.650 --> 21:50.777
But there was an incident
in the kitchen.

21:50.830 --> 21:53.173
What kind of incident?
A stranger wandered in.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.120
One of the busboys
followed him out.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.568
I mean,
nothing was taken,

21:56.610 --> 21:57.827
so I didn't give it
another thought.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.131
Is the busboy here today?

21:59.180 --> 22:00.909
We'd like to speak to him.

22:00.970 --> 22:03.268
You know, I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.572
He may be able to ID
the killer.

22:05.620 --> 22:07.224
Look, I-I want to cooperate
with you

22:07.280 --> 22:10.408
and I-I'm sure he does, too,
but you're with the FBI,

22:10.450 --> 22:12.406
and he's...
Undocumented.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.621
And in
the current climate,

22:14.680 --> 22:17.240
people are understandably
reluctant to talk

22:17.290 --> 22:19.542
to law enforcement,
even about murder.

22:19.590 --> 22:21.410
We're not looking
to report anyone.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.370
We're just looking
for some answers.

22:29.430 --> 22:32.479
Me llamo Aram.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.863
Mucho gusto.

22:34.910 --> 22:37.253
Uh, yeah, that's... That's
the extent of my Spanish.

22:37.310 --> 22:38.607
It was a first period
in high school

22:38.660 --> 22:40.742
and I've never really been
much of a morning person.

22:40.790 --> 22:42.439
Right.

22:42.490 --> 22:46.221
Okay, uh,
here's the thing.

22:46.270 --> 22:47.828
My parents were refugees.

22:49.890 --> 22:52.620
Agent Navabi was
a-a political refugee herself.

22:55.850 --> 22:58.148
Tell him that we both
believe in amnesty.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.806
ARAM: And that we'll go
as soon as he tells us
what he knows.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.032
He saw a man
in the kitchen.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.559
And he asked him
what he's doing here.

23:14.610 --> 23:17.738
He took off.

23:17.780 --> 23:19.566
He chased him
down the block.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.878
Where_ he saw him
get into a taXI
in front of Hotel Macon.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.707
Muchas gracias.

23:27.750 --> 23:29.229
SAMAR: Thank you.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.133
We both feel that way?

23:32.190 --> 23:33.578
Well, I wanted him
to feel comfortable.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.315
I didn't think trying to
convince him that you're

23:35.370 --> 23:37.531
actually a lovable Zionist
was the way to do it.

23:38.670 --> 23:41.059
Agents Navabi
and Mojtabai, FBI.

23:41.110 --> 23:42.975
We need to speak with
your head of security

23:43.030 --> 23:45.066
about any surveillance
footage you might have
of the cab stand.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.370
The license plate
on the cab is yours.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.411
My cab,
my crazy passenger.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.687
You remember him?
Sure.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.597
Guy jumps in,
_ tells me
this insane story

23:54.650 --> 23:56.163
about being chased
by a jealous husband,

23:56.210 --> 23:57.859
and that I should drive
as fast as I can.

23:58.690 --> 24:00.339
Drive where?

24:00.390 --> 24:02.699
FBI!
Show me your hands! FBI!

24:02.740 --> 24:05.049
FBI!

24:05.090 --> 24:07.138
Clear!
Clear.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.649
MAN: Room clear!

24:12.360 --> 24:13.657
ARAM:
Oh, this is disturbing.

24:13.710 --> 24:14.927
What is it?

24:14.970 --> 24:16.312
Beetle larva.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.750
All of which has probably
been genetically modified.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.279
How much do you think it
takes to kill someone?

24:21.320 --> 24:23.629
Oh, a thimbleful,
if that.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.103
Looks like he plans
to kill again.

24:25.150 --> 24:26.321
ARAM: Yeah, it does.

24:26.370 --> 24:30.329
Again and again...
And again.

24:32.900 --> 24:33.946
What the hell happened?

24:33.990 --> 24:35.150
DEMBE: I don't know.

24:35.210 --> 24:36.689
Glen?
Honestly. Glen?

24:36.730 --> 24:38.243
We only found three names.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.460
And if it isn't bad enough,

24:39.520 --> 24:40.771
now my fate rests
in the hands

24:40.820 --> 24:42.378
of Jelly Bean Carter!

24:42.430 --> 24:44.421
This is him.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.640
I'm not talking to him.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.122
Raymond, you're operating
in the dark.

24:47.180 --> 24:48.693
See what he knows.

24:53.230 --> 24:54.572
What the hell
are you doing here?

24:54.620 --> 24:57.088
And where are the people I asked for?

24:57.140 --> 24:59.608
I couldn't risk
putting your fate in
the hands of strangers.

24:59.670 --> 25:03.754
Stra... Glen, Dembe gave you
very specific instructions.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.404
I can do this, boss, trust me.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.758
D-Don't call me boss,
and you cannot do this.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.415
You want to second-guess me,
go right ahead.

25:10.460 --> 25:12.633
Haters gonna hate.
That's what they do.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.591
I-I don't even know
what that means.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.540
I won't let you down.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.160
Not today, not tomorrow,
not no how, not no way,

25:19.210 --> 25:23.385
and that, my friend,
is the name of that tune.

25:25.170 --> 25:26.512
I might as well
just ask the judge

25:26.560 --> 25:28.255
to let me go lie down
in traffic.

25:33.570 --> 25:38.007
Mr. Carter, have you followed
any of the media coverage
regarding this case?

25:38.050 --> 25:39.699
News? Never watch it.

25:39.750 --> 25:41.092
I like the show
with those ladies.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.960
You know, the wives?

25:43.010 --> 25:44.056
What about social media?

25:44.100 --> 25:45.408
Bullies and porn.

25:45.450 --> 25:47.145
Don't care for one,
don't need the other.

25:47.190 --> 25:48.316
Have you ever heard
of Raymond Reddington?

25:48.370 --> 25:49.928
Can't say that I have.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.584
Have you
formed an opinion

25:51.630 --> 25:53.450
of the defendant's guilt
or innocence?

25:53.500 --> 25:55.104
Knew a Fred Reddington
once.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.764
Had four nipples.

25:56.810 --> 25:58.596
JUDGE WILKINS:
As fascinating as that may be,

25:58.640 --> 25:59.857
please just answer
the question.

25:59.900 --> 26:01.458
I don't judge a book
by its cover,

26:01.510 --> 26:02.898
if that's
what you're asking.

26:02.950 --> 26:05.111
What is your feeling
about the death penalty?

26:05.170 --> 26:08.253
I get pre-judged plenty.
I try not to return the favor.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.348
If you were asked
to impose...

26:10.390 --> 26:13.996
Guess you could say
I'm not unlike that
blindfolded beauty,

26:14.050 --> 26:17.690
Dame Justice,
up there in her sillq robe.

26:17.750 --> 26:20.696
No bias, no prejudice.
I don't discriminate.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.832
Or apparently,
follow simple instructions.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.053
Except against cats!
I hate cats.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.443
Besides that, I'm good.
I'm sorry.

26:27.490 --> 26:28.969
What was your question?

26:29.020 --> 26:31.887
Exactly. Move to dismiss
the juror, Your Honor.

26:31.930 --> 26:34.751
On what grounds?
That he's open-minded?

26:34.810 --> 26:37.973
That the abuse
that's been heaped upon him

26:38.030 --> 26:41.022
as a result of his decidedly
unpleasant personality

26:41.070 --> 26:43.538
has made him reluctant
to do unto others

26:43.600 --> 26:45.591
as they have so often
done unto him?

26:45.640 --> 26:47.688
This_ isn't
a popularity contest.

26:47.730 --> 26:50.426
Mr. Sima's dismissiveness
is, I'm sure,

26:50.470 --> 26:53.212
an all too familiar_ event
in this man's life.

26:53.260 --> 26:55.569
He's odd and annoying

26:55.610 --> 26:59.171
and clearly incapable
of following instruction.

26:59.220 --> 27:02.132
I think it's safe to say that
even those who know him best,

27:02.180 --> 27:04.910
perhaps especially
those who know him best,

27:04.970 --> 27:07.871
probably hold him
in remarkably low regard.

27:07.930 --> 27:10.706
But the lamentable
characteristics

27:10.750 --> 27:14.049
that make him an outcast
are the very ones

27:14.110 --> 27:17.147
that make him perfectly suited
to sit on this jury.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.714
Beholden to no one_
because no one likes him.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.899
Capable of making up
his own mind

27:21.940 --> 27:24.636
because he's incapable
of listening to anyone else.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.671
He is an outcast.

27:26.730 --> 27:29.119
Maybe even deservedly so,

27:29.160 --> 27:33.290
but if he's able to administer
blind justice in this case,

27:33.340 --> 27:36.161
I think we should give him
a chance with the blindfold.

27:36.210 --> 27:39.691
Whatever justice this juror
may have been intending

27:39.740 --> 27:42.129
to administer
will hardly be blind

27:42.180 --> 27:45.434
after defense counsel's
stirring remarks
on his behalf.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.914
JUDGE WILKINS: I'm not
so sure he was damning
with faint praise

27:47.970 --> 27:49.961
or praising with
faint damnation.

27:50.010 --> 27:52.615
Either way, if the juror
insists he's impartial,

27:52.670 --> 27:54.399
I'm inclined to take him
at his word.

27:54.450 --> 27:55.530
So I made the cut?

27:55.580 --> 27:57.491
You did, Mr. Carter.

27:57.540 --> 27:59.314
Thank you in advance
for your service.

27:59.370 --> 28:01.622
Thank you, Your Majesty.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.626
And may I say, uh,
unlike my last judge,

28:04.680 --> 28:07.899
you are a tall drink
of water.

28:07.940 --> 28:09.464
SIMA: Your last judge?

28:09.510 --> 28:12.593
In your questionnaire,
you said you hadn't served
on a jury before.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.551
I wasn't on the jury.
I was the defendant.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.556
I won a hundred K
at a craps table in Reno.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.648
Casino took me to court
for sliding dice.

28:18.690 --> 28:20.908
And did you slide dice?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.564
Six boxcars in a row.

28:22.610 --> 28:24.828
So you're
a convicted felon?

28:24.870 --> 28:28.044
Or a parable for our times,
the common man

28:28.090 --> 28:31.560
forced to do something
uncommon to make ends meet.

28:31.620 --> 28:33.520
I bought a sweet condo,
that's for sure.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.448
Mr. Reddington, as moving
as your apparently

28:36.490 --> 28:38.617
boundless empathy
for this man may be,

28:38.670 --> 28:41.013
a convicted felon
may not serve on a jury.

28:41.060 --> 28:42.789
Mr. Carter,
you're dismissed.

28:42.850 --> 28:45.102
For what?
Leveling the playing field?

28:45.150 --> 28:48.449
Odds of rolling
a pair of sixes
is 36-to-1.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.809
House only pays 31-to-1,

28:50.850 --> 28:52.670
and you think
I'm the crook here?

28:52.730 --> 28:55.415
What about a jury
of his peers, huh?

28:55.470 --> 28:58.985
You can't just have a bunch
of pocket protectors!

28:59.040 --> 29:01.861
This is Raymond Reddington
we're talking about!

29:01.910 --> 29:02.990
I thought you didn't
know who he was.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.951
I don't.
Not in a Biblical sense.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.820
That's not how I roll.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.213
Mr. Carter, I think you
should roll on out of here.

29:09.260 --> 29:10.602
Agh.

29:16.270 --> 29:19.000
We had it all wrong
about Lockemy and Kendel
being on opposite sides.

29:19.060 --> 29:21.620
It turns out they both
wanted to legalize Hexapene.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.490
Files from
the Blacklister's lab

29:23.540 --> 29:25.053
indicate that
Lockemy paid Kendel

29:25.110 --> 29:27.670
to support legislation
being considered by Congress.

29:27.720 --> 29:31.929
Paid his organization
$3 million to do an
independent analysis.

29:31.980 --> 29:34.062
I guess for that kind
of money, it's hard to
stay independent.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.725
Have you been able to ID
the Blacklister?

29:36.770 --> 29:39.591
Not yet. We've looked
through the tax records
on the property,

29:39.640 --> 29:41.039
but it's owned
by a holding company.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.298
TAC team's on site now,
but he hasn't showed up.

29:43.340 --> 29:45.729
Kendel sold out
and paid for it with his life.

29:45.780 --> 29:47.680
Lockemy, Steiner,
and Helfrich

29:47.740 --> 29:49.514
were killed
for being true believers.

29:49.570 --> 29:53.040
Dr. Nikkila's
not only a true believer,
he invented Hexapene.

29:53.090 --> 29:54.648
COOPER:
Navabi, reach out to him.

29:54.700 --> 29:58.397
Get him a security detail
and somebody to monitor
what he eats and drinks.

29:58.440 --> 30:01.056
We also found a copy
of a press release

30:01.100 --> 30:03.227
that Kendel's organization
was scheduled to release today

30:03.270 --> 30:05.181
in support of Hexapene.

30:05.230 --> 30:08.233
LIZ: Why today?
A press release is usually
tied to a news event.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.054
The legislation that Congress
is considering

30:10.110 --> 30:11.498
to legalize Hexapene,

30:11.540 --> 30:12.848
the Committee on Energy
and Commerce

30:12.890 --> 30:14.938
is holding a hearing
on it today,

30:14.980 --> 30:19.280
and the Blacklister
had the date circled
in his calendar.

30:19.330 --> 30:20.547
We're on our way.

30:23.510 --> 30:24.556
SAMAR:
We found Dr. Nikkila.

30:24.600 --> 30:25.817
That's a relief.

30:25.860 --> 30:27.464
Not where we found him,
it isn't.

30:27.520 --> 30:28.771
The committee hearing
you're on your way to,

30:28.820 --> 30:30.515
Dr. Nikkila
is the star witness.

30:30.560 --> 30:31.822
We've contacted
Capitol Police,

30:31.870 --> 30:33.952
but we don't
have a description
of the UNSUB.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.171
Were they willing
to postpone the hearing?

30:35.220 --> 30:37.563
Shut down Capitol Hill
over a toxic beetle larva?

30:37.610 --> 30:38.827
It's not gonna happen.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.654
Have you reached out
to Dr. Nikkila?

30:40.700 --> 30:43.487
LIZ: He's not answering.
We've left messages,
phone and text.

30:43.530 --> 30:44.872
Everything we know
suggests this man

30:44.930 --> 30:46.443
will strike again
at the hearing.

30:46.490 --> 30:49.141
When does it start?
Five minutes ago.

30:49.190 --> 30:52.444
Good morning.
My name is
Dr. Jonathan Nikkila.

30:52.500 --> 30:56.539
I want to begin
by thanking you
for inviting me to testify.

30:56.590 --> 30:59.582
I am confident that before
the hearing concludes,

30:59.640 --> 31:01.767
you will agree with me
that the question

31:01.810 --> 31:04.768
of whether or not
to legalize Hexapene

31:04.810 --> 31:08.553
is, quite literally,
a matter of life and death.

31:14.480 --> 31:17.165
Yes, I personally developed
the pesticide in question,

31:17.220 --> 31:20.087
Hexapene,
so I_ can vouch
for its efficacy.

31:20.130 --> 31:21.950
There are some
enVIronmentalists

31:22.010 --> 31:24.137
who worry about its effect
on people,

31:24.180 --> 31:26.967
and it's true that like
all pesticides,

31:27.010 --> 31:30.138
Hexapene can have
negative effects on humans,

31:30.190 --> 31:32.146
but that is not
really the pomt.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.442
Harm to humans isn't the...

31:38.110 --> 31:42.672
I'm sorry. I was asking
isn't harm to humans
the whole pomt?

31:44.680 --> 31:46.853
Agents Ressler
and Keen, FBI.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.379
Yes, Officer Talbert,
Capitol Police.

31:48.420 --> 31:49.899
We spoke.
EMT's en route.

31:49.950 --> 31:52.032
Dr. Nikkila.
Can you take us to him?

31:52.080 --> 31:53.809
The real threat
Hexapene poses

31:53.860 --> 31:55.942
is to the insects,
not humans.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.037
_ It decimates
insect populations.

31:59.090 --> 32:02.127
Not just the insects
it targets, all insects.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.659
It is not the only one.

32:03.700 --> 32:06.134
Pesticides are causing
cataclysmic die-offs

32:06.180 --> 32:08.353
of insects
throughout the world.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.049
It is not just honeybees.

32:10.100 --> 32:11.180
I think we're getting
off topic.

32:11.230 --> 32:14.745
The issue is the harm
caused to humans.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.019
Our land can live
Without humans,
thrive even.

32:18.060 --> 32:20.142
The Earth dies
without insects.

32:20.190 --> 32:22.533
There'll be no pollination,
no crops, no food,

32:22.590 --> 32:25.548
no way to remove
rotting flesh,
dead vegetation.

32:25.590 --> 32:29.765
Without insects,
the Earth will become
a deep, dark graveyard

32:29.810 --> 32:33.075
because we killed off
its most important
inhabitants.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.588
In that case,
why didn't you protest

32:35.640 --> 32:37.813
the making of Hexapene
in the first place?

32:39.870 --> 32:43.340
Because I trusted
my colleagues.

32:43.390 --> 32:46.382
I was assured by them
that Hexapene would
only be used

32:46.440 --> 32:48.044
in the wake
of a natural disaster,

32:48.090 --> 32:51.002
but then I found out
Mr. Lockemy misled me.

32:51.050 --> 32:53.701
He intended to sell
Hexapene everywhere,

32:53.750 --> 32:55.832
and he was lobbying you
to allow it.

32:55.880 --> 32:58.929
I begged him
to reconsider.

32:58.970 --> 33:01.018
He thought I was
being hysterical,

33:01.060 --> 33:03.051
but I felt and feel...

33:03.110 --> 33:05.362
...that people
who poison the planet

33:05.410 --> 33:08.288
present a mortal danger
that must be eliminated

33:08.330 --> 33:13.415
as an act of global
self-defense
and justice.

33:13.460 --> 33:17.590
That, sir, is why you
cannot stop coughing.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.426
You have been poisoned.

33:19.470 --> 33:21.904
Not by me,
but by the insects.

33:21.950 --> 33:23.941
What is he talking about?
Did he say poisoned?

33:24.000 --> 33:27.037
They are genetically modified
Dytiscidaes, to be precise,
predacious diving beetles,

33:27.090 --> 33:28.819
and they have been
growing inside you

33:28.870 --> 33:31.043
since I dosed your wine
at Ruby's.

33:31.090 --> 33:32.694
By now,
they have hatched

33:32.740 --> 33:35.174
and are trying to escape
via your airways.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.971
Security,
detain Mr. Nikkila.

33:50.020 --> 33:52.102
You don't need security,
you need an ambulance,

33:52.160 --> 33:54.151
and this cause
needs attention,

33:54.200 --> 33:55.508
which is exactly what
you are going to give us.

33:55.550 --> 33:57.723
Jonathan Nikkila.
FBI.

33:57.770 --> 34:00.466
DR. NIKKILA: These people
are poisoning the planet.
The insects can save us!

34:00.510 --> 34:02.558
You're under arrest.

34:11.130 --> 34:13.086
You were on the jury!
You'd been picked!

34:13.130 --> 34:14.859
All you had to do
was stop talking!

34:14.920 --> 34:16.137
GLEN: What do you
want me to say?

34:16.180 --> 34:17.488
I've never been picked
for anything before.

34:17.530 --> 34:19.134
It went to my head.

34:19.180 --> 34:22.354
And FYI, I'm not the one that
said hurtful things in there.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.709
No, what you said was
catastrophically stupid.

34:24.750 --> 34:28.925
"Unpleasant personality,
odd, annoying,

34:28.970 --> 34:31.495
"beholden to no one
because no one likes him."

34:31.540 --> 34:33.849
You cut me, man.
You cut me bad.

34:33.890 --> 34:35.448
I cut you?

34:35.500 --> 34:37.968
Without an apology,
I don't know where
we go from here.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.112
I'm sorry.

34:46.950 --> 34:49.202
Dude,
I'm messing with you!

34:49.260 --> 34:51.649
Being odd and annoying's
my stock and trade.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.773
So, tell me
what's the contingency plan?

34:54.830 --> 34:56.127
You were, Glen.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.480
This sucks.

35:02.530 --> 35:04.521
On second thought,
I prefer insistent optimism.

35:09.930 --> 35:11.147
We've been through
worse.

35:13.280 --> 35:16.579
The Nkana mine explosion
in Zambia.

35:16.630 --> 35:18.188
The typhoon
on the trawler.

35:19.460 --> 35:22.509
Forty people,
three life vests.

35:22.550 --> 35:25.155
If we found our way
out of those situations,

35:25.210 --> 35:27.110
we can find our way
out of this one.

35:29.430 --> 35:31.079
That case I gave
the Task Force,

35:31.120 --> 35:33.384
have they identified
General Shiro?

35:33.430 --> 35:36.558
Yes. His name is
Dr. Jonathan Nikkila.

35:36.610 --> 35:39.829
I need you to get into
his lab, get to his files.

35:39.870 --> 35:41.394
What am I looking for?

35:41.440 --> 35:44.568
An address for
my get-out-of-jail-free card.

35:44.620 --> 35:47.134
I believe Nikkila
must have sent him

35:47.180 --> 35:49.444
some of_his toxic
bug jUice.

35:49.490 --> 35:54.223
And without Glen,
he is the last rabbit
in my hat.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.316
The only way out of
this situation is to find him,

35:56.370 --> 35:58.884
and the way to find him
is somewhere in Nikkila's lab.

35:58.930 --> 36:00.807
If there's an address,
I'll find it.

36:00.850 --> 36:02.545
Thank you, Dembe.

36:02.590 --> 36:05.286
I don't _care if it's insistent
optimism or false hope.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.025
At this point,
I'll take either one.

36:16.690 --> 36:18.419
The jury
has been picked.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.777
And?

36:19.820 --> 36:21.344
Raymond is in trouble.
He needs help.

36:21.390 --> 36:23.301
W-What can I do?

36:23.350 --> 36:24.863
Take me
to Dr. Nikkila's lab.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.694
And give you five minutes
alone with him

36:26.740 --> 36:28.002
like I gave you
with The Pharmacist?

36:28.050 --> 36:29.654
It's important,
Elizabeth.

36:29.700 --> 36:31.748
It's also a sealed
crime scene.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.655
Then you need
to unseal it.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.918
SAMAR: You should know
that Robert Carson,

36:37.970 --> 36:40.928
the Committee Chair,
passed away an hour ago.

36:40.980 --> 36:44.802
You really don't understand
the scientific process.

36:44.850 --> 36:47.068
There's no biological benefit
to revenge.

36:47.110 --> 36:49.021
None of those people
were my victims.

36:49.070 --> 36:50.856
They were my experiments.

36:50.900 --> 36:51.855
Experiments?
For what?

36:51.900 --> 36:53.765
The insects, of course.

36:53.820 --> 36:56.596
My crime was to create
a pesticide that kills
them off.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.596
The least I could do
was help them fight back

36:58.650 --> 37:01.687
by giving them the tools
and traits they need
to survive.

37:01.740 --> 37:04.379
But I had to test it,
verify.

37:04.430 --> 37:08.389
I needed to prove
my hypothesis that insects
could fight back,

37:08.440 --> 37:11.045
and my six experiments
proved that they could.

37:11.090 --> 37:13.172
You modified the insects.

37:13.230 --> 37:16.006
You took traits from different
speCIes to make them lethal.

37:16.050 --> 37:18.746
Mmm.
That will be my legacy.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.758
I will not be remembered
as a destroyer of their world,

37:21.800 --> 37:23.233
but their savior.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.663
You said six experiments.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.062
There was Lockemy, Steiner,

37:28.110 --> 37:29.623
Helfrich, Kendel,
the Congressman.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.578
Who was the sixth?

37:32.110 --> 37:34.453
Call an ambulance!

37:34.510 --> 37:35.898
Did you hear me?
Call a medic, now!

37:41.170 --> 37:42.819
You knew you would
get caught,

37:42.860 --> 37:44.339
but you don't care
because you know

37:44.390 --> 37:45.732
you're not going to
prison.

37:45.780 --> 37:48.089
Did you hear me?
Get a medic in here now!

37:48.130 --> 37:49.472
Paramedics are on their way.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.125
That's okay.
Tell them not to rush.

37:52.180 --> 37:54.171
You can leave
for this part

37:54.220 --> 37:55.653
if that would make you
more comfortab...

38:17.640 --> 38:20.154
REDDINGTON:
What a nice surprise.

38:20.210 --> 38:23.429
Oh, if I'd known you were
coming, I would've baked
a cake.

38:24.560 --> 38:25.902
Don't suppose you
have one on you,

38:25.950 --> 38:28.601
perhaps with a file
or a blowtorch in it?

38:28.650 --> 38:30.254
No such luck,
I'm afraid.

38:30.300 --> 38:31.346
Ah, pity.

38:31.390 --> 38:33.699
It's not a blowtorch,

38:33.740 --> 38:35.696
but I thought it might,
uh, calm the nerves.

38:35.740 --> 38:37.788
Grab a chair.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.877
REDDINGTON: I was thinking
earlier about the time

38:43.930 --> 38:46.182
Dembe and I
were on a trawler

38:46.230 --> 38:50.052
that capsized during a typhoon
off the Philippines.

38:50.110 --> 38:54.069
We were running guns to the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front.

38:54.110 --> 38:56.499
It's interesting.

38:56.550 --> 38:59.542
How you always seem to side
with the underdog.

38:59.590 --> 39:02.809
REDDINGTON: Ifind
desperation pays well.

39:02.860 --> 39:04.418
COOPER: The overdog always pays better.

39:06.820 --> 39:08.640
The boat was too full
to begin with,

39:08.690 --> 39:10.339
so when the_storm
caught up With us,

39:10.390 --> 39:12.164
we didn't stand a chance.

39:12.210 --> 39:15.384
Of the 40 people on board,
24 were lost right away.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.000
Another 11
didn't last the night.

39:18.050 --> 39:20.177
There was no life raft.

39:20.220 --> 39:23.485
The militia leaders
took the three
available life vests.

39:23.530 --> 39:25.998
Leaving you and Dembe.

39:26.050 --> 39:26.744
How did you survive?

39:28.190 --> 39:29.350
I didn't.

39:30.230 --> 39:31.788
I drowned that night.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.403
I saw the other side.

39:37.890 --> 39:39.141
It was...

39:40.940 --> 39:42.373
...SO...

39:45.070 --> 39:46.628
...different.

39:50.640 --> 39:51.948
And then I was back.

39:53.340 --> 39:54.511
How he did it...

39:57.090 --> 39:59.650
Found a wooden door,

39:59.700 --> 40:01.122
held me to it,

40:01.180 --> 40:04.172
pounded the water
out of my lungs

40:04.220 --> 40:05.528
and the life back in.

40:14.970 --> 40:16.756
Dembe saved my life
that night.

40:21.890 --> 40:23.676
Dembe's always
saved my life.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.240
LIZ: Did you find
what you came for?

40:32.290 --> 40:34.463
I did.
Thank you, Elizabeth.

40:35.690 --> 40:39.035
He said I reminded him
of my mother.

40:39.080 --> 40:42.345
That's what he said
when I asked him why
he gave us this case.

40:44.090 --> 40:45.125
He's right.

40:46.310 --> 40:47.561
You remind me of her,
too.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.480
You know everything.

40:52.530 --> 40:53.781
Keep your head down

40:53.840 --> 40:55.262
Don't you?

40:56.270 --> 40:57.612
Keep moving

40:57.670 --> 40:58.887
Everything about him.

41:00.670 --> 41:02.535
All the answers
I'm looking for.

41:04.460 --> 41:06.849
Listen for a sound

41:06.890 --> 41:08.061
I do.

41:08.110 --> 41:11.671
Keep moving

41:16.030 --> 41:17.907
They'll never pin you down

41:19.560 --> 41:22.165
If you keep moving

41:24.910 --> 41:27.378
Do you and each of you
solemnly swear

41:27.440 --> 41:29.385
that you will well
and truly try

41:29.440 --> 41:32.136
and a true deliverance make
between the United States

41:32.180 --> 41:34.432
and Raymond Reddington
a true verdict

41:34.490 --> 41:37.004
rendered according to
the evidence, so help you God?

41:37.050 --> 41:39.223
TOGETHER: I do.

41:39.270 --> 41:41.147
JUDGE WILKINS:
With the jury in place,
trial is set to commence

41:41.190 --> 41:42.919
Tuesday morning at 8:00 am.

41:42.970 --> 41:44.187
I will see you all then.

41:51.630 --> 41:53.063
That's a smug little grin.

41:54.940 --> 41:56.988
I've been a prosecutor
for 18 years.

41:57.030 --> 41:59.817
I have empaneled
over 300 juries.

41:59.860 --> 42:02.203
It's usually a flip of a coin
as to which way

42:02.250 --> 42:03.649
they're gonna lean,
but this group...

42:04.730 --> 42:07.164
This is a two-headed coin,
my friend.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.824
Your fate is sealed.

42:08.870 --> 42:10.826
We'll see about that.

42:10.870 --> 42:13.919
I respect
the false confidence,
but you and I both know

42:13.960 --> 42:14.915
you're a dead man walking.
