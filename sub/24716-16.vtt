ANDY: <i>Previously on </i>NYPD Blue...

00:02.836 --> 00:05.338
I just heard from a friend
who oversees the sergeant’s exam.

00:05.588 --> 00:07.674
-You passed.
-You’re kidding.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.343
-You ready to be a boss?
-I don’t know.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.803
I guess you’ll find that out.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.766
You’re pretty good with those things.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.311
Mm-hmm. Watch this.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.235
(CHUCKLES)

00:42.125 --> 00:43.126
Hey.

00:43.251 --> 00:45.712
His name is Hugh Rasmussen.
According to his secretary,

00:45.795 --> 00:48.048
he was a partner
at Fairchild and Rasmussen.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.550
-Some big Wall Street law firm.
-How did the job come in?

00:50.842 --> 00:53.219
Secretary, she found him.
Her name is Judith Howell.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.847
-She got here around 8:30.
-This guy was still working at his age?

00:55.972 --> 00:58.892
She says he was retired but kept her on,
so she’d come over every day

00:58.975 --> 01:01.436
-to see what he needed.
-Doesn’t look like he’s got any bruises.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.897
She said the pillow was over
his face when she walked in.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.690
-Where is she?
-Out in the living room.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.907
-Ms. Howell?
-Yes?

01:14.407 --> 01:15.950
Can you tell us
what happened this morning?

01:16.159 --> 01:20.705
I... got here at 7:30
as I always do. I let myself in.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.791
I made myself a cup of tea,
and I waited in the kitchen.

01:23.333 --> 01:27.128
At around 8:15, not having heard
from Mr. Rasmussen,

01:27.212 --> 01:29.964
I went into the bedroom,
which is where I found him.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.758
-You were coming from where?
-My home,

01:31.841 --> 01:34.594
which is at 32-20 Crocheron Avenue
in Flushing.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.889
-You must leave the house early.
-Around 6:15.

01:38.014 --> 01:41.392
-How do you get to work?
-I drive to Long Island City, I park,

01:41.518 --> 01:43.061
and I take the number seven train in.

01:43.186 --> 01:46.022
-Mr. Rasmussen, married?
-Yes, he is.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.775
-Do you know where his wife is?
-I know she isn’t here.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.320
I think she got picked up
this morning by a friend of hers.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.531
Where they went, that I don’t know.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.701
-How long had you been working for him?
-I came to work in 1977.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.704
-You must have been very attached to him.
-I was.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.040
(EXHALES) Well, we’re very sorry
for your loss.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.501
Thank you very much for saying that.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.796
-What’s going on?
-She’s the wife.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.883
Uh, there seems to have been an accident.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.260
Hugh is dead, Amy.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.138
-What?
-Someone suffocated him

02:18.388 --> 02:20.390
by putting a pillow over his face
and holding it there.

02:20.473 --> 02:24.227
Judith, why don’t you give us
a minute with Amy, please?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.230
I’ll be in the kitchen if you need me.

02:29.691 --> 02:30.733
Have a seat.

02:35.613 --> 02:39.117
Um, we know this is a difficult time,
and it’s a big shock,

02:39.200 --> 02:40.618
but we have a couple questions for you.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.080
Can we get you anything,
something to drink?

02:44.664 --> 02:46.958
No, go ahead.
Ask me whatever you have to ask me.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.543
When’s the last time you saw your husband?

02:48.918 --> 02:51.546
When I left for the gym this morning,
that was about 6:30.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.298
-Everything seem normal?
-Uh-huh.

02:54.757 --> 02:58.553
I kissed him goodbye.
Told him that we’d have lunch together.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.638
How long had you
and your husband been married?

03:01.055 --> 03:03.183
It would’ve been two years
this coming July.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.767
Was it a good relationship?

03:05.226 --> 03:07.020
Are you asking that
because of the difference in age?

03:07.353 --> 03:10.106
-It’s a pretty extreme difference.
-Right, and people look at Hugh

03:10.190 --> 03:12.233
like he’s a dirty old man
and me like I’m a gold digger.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.068
And everyone with their judgments
and their opinions,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.445
can just go straight to hell.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.908
-Where is he?
-In the bedroom.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.035
-I want to see him.
-You might not want

03:22.118 --> 03:24.454
-to put yourself through that.
-He’s my husband, and I want to see him.

Guy had ties older than her.

Anyway, we dumped the phone.
We got his lawyer coming in

05:21.863 --> 05:24.032
to give us details
of their financial arrangement.

-She’s hot.

No, I... I mean, we don’t know really,
what her background is.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.584
-That would be a good thing to find out.
-Absolutely.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.044
We’ll keep you posted.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.087
Getting promoted today?

05:59.067 --> 06:01.903
Yeah, I had it at the tailor’s
to sew on the sergeant’s stripes.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.112
I’m sure it’s in good shape.

taking the family after?

06:05.406 --> 06:08.117
-I made a reservation at Shun Lee.
-Oh, that’s nice.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.496
We got a DOA, possible homicide
at the Senior citizens’ home.

06:11.579 --> 06:12.997
-Who’s up?
-Oh, that’s me.

-What’s going on?
-DOA is Olive Rosenthal.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.138
She didn’t show up
for breakfast this morning.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.432
One of the aides came to check on her
and found her dead.

06:31.682 --> 06:32.683
Why are we here?

06:32.892 --> 06:34.477
Doctor wouldn’t sign
the death certificate.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.521
He’s in the next room.
Name is Shawn Marra.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.026
-Dr. Marra.
-Yes.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.236
What’s the problem?

06:43.569 --> 06:46.739
I was called by the director
to come and examine Mrs. Rosenthal,

06:46.823 --> 06:48.991
and sign on the death certificate.
And when I got here,

06:49.283 --> 06:51.953
I saw a blood spot on her nightgown
in the abdominal area.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.831
I examined underneath
and saw evidence of an injection.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.917
-When’s the last time you saw her?
-About two weeks ago.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.294
-Healthy?
-Given her age? Yeah.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.713
What you’re saying is evidence
of an injection

07:02.797 --> 07:05.007
-could that be anything else?
-There’s a bruise,

07:05.216 --> 07:06.592
and what I think is a needle mark.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.638
You know, I can’t state conclusively that
that’s what it is and absent any autopsy.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.849
I can’t state conclusively that
that’s what killed her.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.310
But there’s just no way, at this point,
that I’m gonna sign off on it

07:16.394 --> 07:17.562
being natural causes.

07:17.854 --> 07:21.899
-Okay. The director around?
-In here. Her name’s Lillian Jacobs.

-Uh, Ms. Jacobs.
-That's me.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.740
I’m Detective Medavoy.
This is Detective Jones.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.160
What can you tell us about Mrs. Rosenthal?

07:32.243 --> 07:33.744
She was with us about six months.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.539
Uh, nothing particularly
unusual about her.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.291
Any complaints from her
about conflicts with anyone?

07:38.833 --> 07:39.876
None that I’m aware of.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.086
-Who was the aide that found her?
-That would be Eleanor.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.339
Eleanor, these are detectives.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
Why don’t you tell them
what happened this morning?

07:47.675 --> 07:49.594
When Mrs. Rosenthal
didn’t come to breakfast,

07:49.719 --> 07:50.928
I went to check on her.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.764
I found her not breathing,
and I hit the panic button.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.601
Eleanor worked full time
as Mrs. Rosenthal’s aide.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.936
Was there anyone else
that would come into her room?

07:59.353 --> 08:01.814
She might have visitors. But as a rule,
there were no staff people

08:01.898 --> 08:03.399
coming in other than Eleanor.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.028
Um, mind I speak to you
for a moment privately?

08:10.364 --> 08:12.992
Because this kind of thing
can be very upsetting

08:13.075 --> 08:15.786
for the other residents. I would ask that
you didn’t speak to them about it.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.289
-Well, that might be unavoidable.
-Why is that?

08:18.664 --> 08:19.916
In order to investigate a homicide,

08:19.999 --> 08:21.584
we have to talk to people
who knew the victim.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.086
Well, number one,
you don’t know that this is a homicide.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.588
And number two... (SCOFFS)

08:25.796 --> 08:28.508
...how much information do you think
you’re gonna get from these people?

08:28.925 --> 08:31.260
Well, we won’t know that
until we talk to them.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.477
What was the financial arrangement
between Rasmussen and his wife?

08:39.894 --> 08:42.730
If they got a divorce,
regardless of who initiated it,

08:42.813 --> 08:45.733
it was a straight buyout 500,000 all-in.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.527
If they were together
at the time of his death,

08:47.818 --> 08:50.488
-then she inherited half his estate.
-Who got the other half?

08:50.613 --> 08:53.699
It was split between a number
of employees, friends.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.911
There were substantial
bequests to some institutions.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.081
-He also set up a trust for his brother.
-What’s the estate worth?

09:00.456 --> 09:02.792
All told, about 120 million.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.003
Far as you can tell,
did him and the wife get along?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.880
I don’t know what kind
of arrangement they had,

09:07.964 --> 09:09.423
but they seemed to get along fine.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.343
-What does that mean?
-It means she’s 28 years old.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.762
She didn’t necessarily
conform her lifestyle

09:14.845 --> 09:16.305
to that of an 80-year-old man.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.059
So, are you telling us she had some
extracurricular relationships going on?

09:20.226 --> 09:21.435
At least one that I know of.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.729
-Who is he?
-LAWYER: The only reason I know about him

09:23.980 --> 09:27.316
is I was shown an unexplained
42,000-dollar expenditure

09:27.567 --> 09:29.443
by his accountant.
When I asked Hugh about it,

09:29.527 --> 09:33.239
He told me it was for a truck
for a friend of Amy’s.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.117
-You know the friend’s name?
-Richard Pencava.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.910
And where we can get in touch with him?

09:38.077 --> 09:40.037
I made a point of knowing
how to get in touch with him.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.082
Amy might have convinced Hugh
it was an innocent relationship.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.001
She didn’t convince me.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.255
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

09:49.964 --> 09:51.924
This is the daughter of the woman
in the nursing home.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.385
It’s not a nursing home.
It’s an assisted-living facility.

09:54.844 --> 09:55.886
Sorry.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.515

-Hi.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.436
Why don’t we come back in here?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.940
You’ll have to forgive me.
I got the news about my mother

10:08.024 --> 10:11.444
two hours ago, and I’m holding it
together but just barely.

10:12.403 --> 10:16.741
It’s very tough to lose a mother.
I... I lost mine a number of years ago.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.410
And I... I can still get choked up
thinking about it.

10:19.535 --> 10:20.953
Where do we stand with the investigation?

10:21.078 --> 10:23.581
We’re waiting for the toxicology panels
to come back

10:23.664 --> 10:25.082
from the medical examiner’s office.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.960
In the meantime, we’re looking
at who might’ve had access to her room.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.920
It’s conclusive she was injected
with something.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.922
Based on our preliminary examination,

10:32.006 --> 10:33.007
-yeah.
-NORA: Okay.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.676
Here’s who your investigation
should focus on.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.386
Her name is Eleanor Jackson.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.431
She lives, I believe,
on Gun Hill Road in the Bronx.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.559
As soon as I get to the office,
I’ll call with the exact address.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.145
The Eleanor Jackson
who found your mother this morning?

10:46.395 --> 10:49.148
-Pretended to find her.
-What makes you suspect her?

10:49.440 --> 10:52.526
I hired her so that my mother
would have someone with her at all times.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.987
And what I was seeing
more and more of was that

10:55.279 --> 10:59.075
she was asserting her own will
in ways that were inappropriate.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.243
-Like how?
-Rearranging furniture,

11:01.327 --> 11:04.080
dispensing opinions on things
that didn’t concern her.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.958
Doesn’t sound like much,
but it wasn’t what she was paid to do.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.586
It’s a long way from that
to committing murder.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.380
I also believe she was stealing.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.882
The last time I was there,
I noticed things missing.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.926
-When was that?
-About a month ago.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.220
I’m quite sure
if you search her apartment,

11:19.345 --> 11:20.846
you’ll find whatever’s missing.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.307
Well, at present, we have no right
to search her apartment.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.101
Let’s see if I can’t help you with that.

11:25.643 --> 11:29.063
Ms. Rosenthal, there’s something
called, "probable cause,"

11:29.146 --> 11:31.315
which you have to show
in order to get a search warrant.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.527
I am a New York State
Supreme Court judge, detective.

11:34.610 --> 11:38.322
I know full well what is required
to get a search warrant.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.284
We’ll definitely look at Eleanor Jackson.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.037
-I want an arrest made.
-Assuming the facts, warranted.

11:45.287 --> 11:48.207
I’ll expect to hear from you
by the end of the day.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.058
-Have a piece of candy?
-Oh, no, thank you.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.186
-Your friend want?
-Oh, thank you. I'm... I’m fine.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.772
What can you tell us
about your friend Olive?

12:12.022 --> 12:16.444
Well, she got here about six months ago.
A little shy at first.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.989
-And you became friends with her?
-I understood what she was going through.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.866
You know, it’s not so easy.

12:22.074 --> 12:27.455
You see nice surroundings, very expensive.
Then you wonder, "What’s the problem?"

12:27.747 --> 12:30.624
Believe you me,
there are plenty of problems.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.836
And until you get old. You don’t know.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.047
Eleanor Jackson was her aide.
Was that right?

12:37.423 --> 12:40.301
Yeah, she broke her hip last year,
and her daughter wanted

12:40.551 --> 12:41.802
someone to be with her.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.555
I mean, to tell you the truth,
she didn’t need anybody,

12:45.139 --> 12:48.684
But to make her daughter feel better,
she had her.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.728
Well, did they get along?
She and Eleanor?

12:50.978 --> 12:52.855
-What’s not to get along? (CHUCKLES)
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

12:53.481 --> 12:54.899
Come in.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.943
-You have company.
-Yes, I have company.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.322
All right, you don’t have to speak
to me so sharp.

13:01.697 --> 13:05.534
-I’m mad at you, Enid.
-So be mad at me.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.581
-Why are you mad at her?
-That’s between us.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.041
You had a tiff?

13:12.666 --> 13:16.378
-You know you’re very condescending.
-I’m asking you why you’re mad at her.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.506
In case it relates to Olive’s death
in some way.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.800
Well, I’m mad at her
because she didn’t understand

13:20.883 --> 13:22.510
why I was so upset this morning.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.638
-But wasn’t she upset?
-Apparently not.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.447
JOHN: Richard Pencava

13:43.864 --> 13:45.825
-Yeah, why? What’s going on?
-Can you step out of the truck

13:45.908 --> 13:46.867
-for a second?
-Why?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.828
We’ll explain it to you
when you get out of the truck.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.539
Come on guys, you are embarrassing me,
doing this here.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.290
We’ll try to do it as quick as we can.

Now they see me getting hassled by cops.

Do you know a girl
by the name of Amy Rasmussen?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.756
Yeah, what kind of trouble is she in now?

14:01.131 --> 14:02.800
What makes you think
she’s in any kind of trouble?

14:03.050 --> 14:04.760
Yeah, you’re right.
I shouldn’t jump to conclusions.

in this truck do you?

14:06.887 --> 14:09.223
-What kind of weapons? No.
-No guns, nothing like that?

14:09.348 --> 14:11.684
-No, I don’t have any guns.
-All right. Mind if we take a look inside?

14:11.809 --> 14:13.102
Yeah, go ahead. I don’t have any guns.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.063
Can we take a look
in your glove compartment?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.898
Go ahead.
I said I don’t have any guns. Yeah.

-Rolled up.
-I don't know.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.911
Richard, do you got anything else
in there? You’re not supposed to have?

14:31.036 --> 14:32.663
Thought you said
you were looking for guns.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.500
-What’s this?
-I don’t know what that is. Come on!

14:36.584 --> 14:38.794
JOHN: I think I know what that is.
Put your hands on the truck. Come on.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.129
Man.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.386
ADA Munson has a search warrant
for the apartment of an Eleanor Jackson

14:47.469 --> 14:49.346
-we’re supposed to execute.
-The nurse’s aide?

14:49.513 --> 14:52.349
-Right.
-And how did you get a judge to sign that?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.935
The DOA’s daughter is Judge Rosenthal.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.187
I had to guess I’d say
it was a matter of professional courtesy.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.649
When I think of what I’ve had,
and not been able to get a search warrant.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.651
Well, you didn’t have a judge
in your hip pocket.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.778
If you don’t come up with anything,
chalk it up to servicing

15:04.904 --> 15:06.155

15:06.322 --> 15:08.532
We have an inventory and description
of the items missing.

15:08.699 --> 15:09.825
We’ll let you know what we find.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.418
-I was just thinking of you.
-Oh, yeah?

15:20.294 --> 15:22.796
I was, uh, wondering
if you were free for lunch.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.633
I actually have to have lunch
with my father today.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.635
-Oh, well.
-Wait a minute. Why don’t you come?

15:27.885 --> 15:30.387
-(SCOFFS) No, thanks.
-If you’re there, it’ll be tolerable.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.890
Otherwise, it’s gonna be
another career-day counseling session.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.183
Your father doesn’t want me along.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.977
He won’t mind,
and I will be really grateful.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.772
-Where are we doing this?
-I’ll give you a call.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.065
Okay.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.489
-You got a sec?
-Yeah. John, take him into the room.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.699
-JOHN: You want me to start without you?
-I’ll be right there.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.662
What are you looking to do
following the promotion?

15:56.205 --> 15:57.539
Hadn’t really thought about it.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.793
Do you want to be retained
here in the 15th?

16:01.919 --> 16:03.587
-On patrol?
-Yeah.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.798
I wouldn’t mind that,
for the time being, anyway.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.925
I’ll make a call, see what I can do.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.055
Sit down.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.103
I swear to God I have no idea
how that cocaine got in that truck.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.355
You can square it with God
on your own time.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.524
As far as we’re concerned,
you’re looking at a B felony.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.944
-Any way I can catch a break on that?
-Depends.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.446
What was your relationship
with Amy Rasmussen?

16:29.780 --> 16:31.907
-We’re friends. Why?
-When’s the last time you saw her?

16:32.032 --> 16:33.909
What is she in some kind
of trouble or something?

16:34.034 --> 16:36.495
It’s a simple question.
Do you want to help yourself or not?

16:37.663 --> 16:40.416
-I don’t know when it was.
-When’s the last time you saw her husband?

16:41.166 --> 16:43.002
I met the guy once, maybe six months ago.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.254
Well, Richard,
he was murdered this morning.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.257
Whoa. I don’t know anything about that.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.509
Your number was dialed
from the house phone this morning.

16:50.801 --> 16:54.013
-Did Amy call you?
-Yeah, she wanted to see how I was doing.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.848
Don’t tell us fairy tales, Richard.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.349
Why was she calling you?

16:58.225 --> 17:00.769
-I picked her up this morning.
-Did you go in the apartment?

17:01.061 --> 17:03.105
No, I was taking her to see this building.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.065
I was running late.
She called to see where I was.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.859
Why were you taking her to see a building?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.152
I wanted to buy it.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.946
I thought I could rehab it,
sell off the units, make some money.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.907
I needed help with the purchase price,
so I called her.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.367
-You sleeping with her?
-No.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.578
She buys you a new truck,
and now you’re talking to her

17:17.661 --> 17:18.662
about buying a building?

17:19.121 --> 17:23.000
We had a romantic relationship.
One thing and another, and we broke up.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.294
Didn’t mean she lost her desire for you.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.424
That’s right. It didn’t mean that.
Come to think of it.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.801
Just might have been too much to ask her
to stay faithful.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.054
Given he was like, ancient.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.099
-Maybe she wanted him out of the way.
-So you two could be together.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.563
If I testify against her,
cocaine charges get dropped?

17:45.606 --> 17:48.442
I guess we can assume that
you’re willing to consider that, right?

17:49.109 --> 17:50.360
Hey, I gotta do what I gotta do.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.323
Sit tight.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.503
What do you want to tell us
about the things

18:07.586 --> 18:08.837
we found in your apartment?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.339
Mrs. Rosenthal gave them to me.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.424
Well, her daughter wasn’t aware
she’d done that.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.676
All kinds of things
her daughter’s not aware of.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.929
She didn’t pay her mother
a visit but once a month.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.473
Did she ever ask you
where her mother’s things were?

18:20.015 --> 18:21.892
I don’t remember whether she did
or she didn’t.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.061
I think you do remember,
and I think she did.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.229
What did you tell her, Eleanor?

18:25.562 --> 18:27.231
I told her I didn’t know nothing about it.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.900
Well, if her mother gave you
permission to take them,

18:30.025 --> 18:31.318
then why wouldn’t you have said that?

18:31.485 --> 18:32.986
’Cause I didn’t want her taking them back.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.823
Well, you can explain all that
to a judge, Eleanor, but I gotta tell you,

18:35.948 --> 18:37.991
chances are you’re looking
at a burglary prosecution.

18:38.408 --> 18:41.078
Probably don’t help me none
the daughter’s a judge herself.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.371
No, it doesn’t.

18:42.663 --> 18:46.792
She gave me the picture frame.
She gave me the candlesticks.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.837
She gave me the silver bowl,
’cause she said she had no use for it.

18:51.588 --> 18:54.341
I took the bracelet... I shouldn’t have.

18:55.008 --> 18:58.011
I know I shouldn’t have,
but I was looking at it one day,

18:58.262 --> 19:00.806
feeling bad ’cause her daughter
had yelled at me on the phone.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.474
And since Olive never wore it,

19:02.641 --> 19:04.518
I figured I was taking it
from her daughter.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.813
That don’t make it right.
But that’s why I did it.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.566
And you were afraid of getting caught.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.569
Is that why you injected her
with a drug, Eleanor?

19:15.028 --> 19:17.197
-You think I did that?
-You had the opportunity to do it.

19:17.281 --> 19:20.033
-You had a reason to do it.
-I cared for that woman.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.202
You have nurse’s aide,
making seven dollars

19:22.327 --> 19:24.663
-and fifteen cents an hour.
-That don’t make me wicked.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.415
Nobody’s saying it does.

19:26.498 --> 19:29.418
Only a wicked soul would hurt that woman.

19:30.335 --> 19:34.339
Now, I may not be perfect, sir,
but my soul is not wicked.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.851
I’m reading about this Carly Fiorina.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.145
-Do you know who she is?
-No.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.063
She’s the CEO of Hewlett-Packard.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.691
She’s one pisser of a gal, I’ll tell you.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.736
My father regularly updates me
on the careers of various women

19:55.819 --> 19:57.279
who have climbed the corporate ladder.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.239
’Cause I want her to see
what women are capable of.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.616
Is there anything wrong with that?

20:01.116 --> 20:02.242
Not so far as I can tell.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.703
-How was your veal?
-Tough.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.622
And I’ll tell you something else,

20:06.747 --> 20:08.790
it’s not every father
who sees his daughter is capable

20:08.874 --> 20:11.376
of going out and laying waste
to the competition.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.045
This little girl is all of that.

20:13.170 --> 20:17.507
-I’ve seen her in action. She’s terrific.
-Thank you, John.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.260

in a major-league ballpark.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.013
-Well, she’s in the Manhattan DA’s office.
-That’s a city job.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.058
I mean, let’s be honest.
Civil service at its best

20:26.141 --> 20:28.977
is a backwash of modest talent
and stunted ambition.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.979
-Am I right, or am I right?
-Daddy, did I not mention

20:31.063 --> 20:34.107
-that John is a New York City detective?
-That’s great.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.943
John, I don’t know your background.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.946
Maybe the police department
is a stepping stone for you.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.531
-Maybe... maybe you’re happy there.
-I’m pretty happy there.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.327
God bless you. All I'm saying
is that with her intelligence

20:45.452 --> 20:48.538
and the kind of connections
that she’s able to capitalize on,

20:48.747 --> 20:52.626
-there’s nowhere she can’t go.
-Yeah, I’m doing what I want to be doing.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.919
Can we just leave it at that?

20:54.169 --> 20:56.255
You told me you were going
to do a three-year stint

20:56.380 --> 20:59.049

and head for the high corn.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.012

in the direction

21:04.096 --> 21:05.514
of making good on that plan.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.475
Now, what am I supposed to do?
Keep my feelings to myself?

21:08.809 --> 21:10.352
Oh, no, Daddy. Don’t do that.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.646
Naturally, everyone wants
the best for their children.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.314

-How’d you get there?

you were seen getting into a pickup truck

that would be wrong?

into a pickup truck

And I couldn’t say it in front of her.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.538
-And why was that?
-Because she hates me as it is,

22:11.788 --> 22:14.958
and I don’t like to give her
ammunition to go after me with.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.879
I lied right now
because I lied before, so...

22:19.254 --> 22:21.465
-You started seeing this guy?
-No, I did not.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.216
JOHN: All right, Amy.
We talked to Richard.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.510
We know about the truck.
We know about the building.

22:25.969 --> 22:28.555
-The truck I felt like I owed him.
-Based on what?

22:28.889 --> 22:32.309
There was a time when I needed help,
and he was there for me.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.935
At least, at first.

22:34.144 --> 22:37.105
He got in touch with me a few months ago.
He was broke.

22:37.647 --> 22:41.151
He said that if he had a truck,
he could start making a living again.

22:41.234 --> 22:44.196
I talked to Hugh, and I told him
there was nothing going on between us,

22:44.321 --> 22:47.699
because nothing was going on between us.

22:48.825 --> 22:51.870
-He bought him the truck.
-Was he gonna buy him the building?

22:52.120 --> 22:54.456
No, and I wasn’t gonna ask him to.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.458
-Why were you going to see it?
-Just to go.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.753
I was trying to be a good friend.
Trying to be encouraging.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.339
Maybe it was an accident with the pillow?

23:04.174 --> 23:05.300
You think I killed Hugh?

23:05.425 --> 23:07.552
I think maybe a part of you
wanted him out of the way.

23:08.136 --> 23:11.640
-No part of me wanted that.
-You’re 28 years old, your husband was 80.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.476
You stood to make 500,000
if you divorced him,

23:14.768 --> 23:16.353
and 60 million if he died.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.272
That’s a boatload of temptation
staring you in the face, kid.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.608
-How dare you.
-Have I spoken out of turn?

23:21.691 --> 23:24.403
-You don’t know the first thing about me.
-Fill us in.

23:24.820 --> 23:28.865
I was run out on by my father.
I was turned out by my stepfather.

23:28.990 --> 23:32.536
When I met Hugh, I had been abused
by every man and woman

23:32.744 --> 23:35.747
I had ever been involved with.
I was a strung-out call girl,

23:35.956 --> 23:38.375
and when a friend of his paid me
to go over to his apartment,

23:38.458 --> 23:39.584
I took one look at that place,

23:39.751 --> 23:42.045
and the only thing I could think
about was how I was gonna rob it.

23:42.921 --> 23:43.922
Why didn’t you?

23:46.800 --> 23:48.301
Because I liked him.

23:49.094 --> 23:52.222
The first few times I was with him,
he didn’t want to have sex.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.058
He just wanted to talk, watch TV.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.978
(SNIFFLES) He would read to me
from these books...

23:59.104 --> 24:03.191
Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Ralph Waldo Emerson, E.B. White.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.694
I didn’t know who they were.
Half the time, I didn’t know

24:05.777 --> 24:08.780
what they were talking about,
but he would try and explain it to me.

24:09.739 --> 24:13.368
(SNIFFLES) He eventually put me in rehab
and got me healthy.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.746
And I fell in love with him.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.544
I don’t really care
if you believe me or not,

24:22.627 --> 24:25.005
because the way I feel right now,
I don’t care what you do to me.

24:25.338 --> 24:26.381
(SNIFFLES)

24:26.715 --> 24:29.384
But how dare you say
that I was tempted by money.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.304
If I could still have him with me,

24:32.804 --> 24:35.098
I wouldn’t trade it in
for all the money in the world.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.906
-She didn’t do it, Andy.
-Uh-huh.

24:51.114 --> 24:52.908
No, I mean it.
I really don’t think she did.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.827
How many times you gonna take orders
from your little captain down there?

24:55.952 --> 24:57.370
-That’s not what I’m doing.
-It’s not, huh?

24:57.704 --> 24:59.539
I stop and look at something
in the window doesn’t mean

24:59.623 --> 25:02.292
I’m gonna buy it.
What I say we do is talk to the brother.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.462
The fact that the will sets up a trust
rather than gives him the money outright.

25:05.629 --> 25:06.963
-Tells you something’s off.
-Yeah.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.509
Good idea. I’d just rather not think
we’re doing it on this girl’s behalf.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.052
Just part of the investigation.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.893
-Mr. Munson.
-Someplace we can talk?

25:20.560 --> 25:21.603
I’ll be right back.

-Coffee?
-Uh, no thanks.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.531
I’d like to make a proposition.
If it’s not something

25:32.614 --> 25:34.783
you’re interested in,
I’m sure you’ll say so.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.702
-Sure.
-I have some potential clients

25:37.786 --> 25:39.996
coming in from Hong Kong
in a couple of weeks.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.164
They’re heavy gamblers.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.458
And I know they wanna go
down to Atlantic City.

25:43.792 --> 25:47.128
I just want to see if you’re available
to watch out for them.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.839
-They need a bodyguard?
-I don’t know that they need one.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.842
It... makes ’em feel important
to have one.

25:53.009 --> 25:56.054
Well, it depends on what’s going on here
at work and how much time is required.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.807
You give me as much
or as little time as you want.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.976
I just wanna tell you
it'll pay thousand dollars a day,

26:01.476 --> 26:03.603
and the need for this comes up
with some regularity.

26:03.728 --> 26:04.854
I’m definitely interested.

26:05.438 --> 26:07.524
According to my daughter,
you’re a heads-up guy.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.192
That’s very nice of her to say that.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.361
Not to say that she
hasn’t been wrong once or twice.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.614
-Haven’t we all?
-Anyway, I hope you think about it.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.366
Appreciate the offer.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.870
Hey, boss, the blood work
that comes back on our DOA.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.455
Shows a veterinary drug
was used to kill her.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.249
-That point to anybody?
-Well, there’s a resident

26:24.332 --> 26:25.375
in the place, who knew her.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.669
Whose son’s a veterinarian
and until she retired,

26:27.794 --> 26:29.045
was a veterinarian herself.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.797
Sounds like that’s who
you ought to be looking at.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.299
We were hoping to toss her room.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.050
Didn’t take much to get a warrant
the first time,

26:34.259 --> 26:36.720
so, we're hoping that Munson
might be willing to go for another one.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.264
-Call and ask her.
-GREG: Since we broke a little bat

26:39.639 --> 26:42.183
over the DOA's daughter
using her influence, uh,

26:42.350 --> 26:43.977
we didn’t want it to seem
like we were asking

26:44.060 --> 26:46.605
-just to make a point.
-Do you want me to ask?

26:47.564 --> 26:49.357
It might be better coming from you.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.588
-We got a couple questions for you.
-About what?

27:11.838 --> 27:14.007
Somebody seems to think
you were involved in an accident.

27:14.507 --> 27:16.718
-What kind of accident?
-Just talk to us for a second,

27:16.801 --> 27:17.969
so we can straighten it out.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.221
-Can I get a bet down on the four horse?
-Sure.

27:20.388 --> 27:24.017
Well, he ran at Hambleton a little
while back, and he came out of nowhere.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.144
He got boxed in,
and now he’s going off at six to one.

27:26.227 --> 27:28.730
-He’s running from the outside.
-Where were you this morning, Jerry?

27:29.230 --> 27:31.107
-I was at my job.
-Oh, which is what?

I sell advertising at a radio station.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.654
When’s the last time you saw your brother?

27:36.321 --> 27:37.405
Christmas.

27:38.114 --> 27:41.618
-Why? What happened to my brother?
-Your brother’s dead, Jerry.

Hey, let’s go.

take it easy, pal?

27:45.705 --> 27:47.207
Why don’t we go over here, so we can talk?

27:49.668 --> 27:51.711
What kind of relationship
did you have with him?

27:53.421 --> 27:56.257
-Well, it had its problems.
-Like what?

27:56.591 --> 27:58.968
He tried to put me through school,
and that didn’t work out.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.971
Then he tried to get me started
in different business ventures.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.181
They didn’t work out.

28:04.432 --> 28:07.310
Probably thought I was a dope.
Can’t say he’s wrong but...

28:08.478 --> 28:11.856
Through it all, I always knew
that if I ever needed him,

28:13.149 --> 28:14.234
he’d be there.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.611
Jerry, what can you tell us
about your brother’s wife?

28:16.986 --> 28:18.446
Oh, some people don’t like her, but I do.

28:19.155 --> 28:21.950
-Who doesn’t like her?
-My brother’s secretary didn’t,

28:22.283 --> 28:25.120
-but then she didn’t like me much either.
-Why didn’t she like her?

28:25.620 --> 28:28.540
I think she was hoping that
when my brother’s first wife died

28:28.623 --> 28:31.376
-that she’d be next in line.
-Well, what makes you say that?

28:31.501 --> 28:33.336
That was the only time
she was friendly with me.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.965
After the funeral, back at the house,
she had a whole different personality.

28:37.257 --> 28:40.301
Asking me what I was doing
and joking around with me.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.430
I think she was trying to show my brother
that she could be the lady of the house.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.640
And take care of all
the family obligations for him.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.851
How long after that
did Amy come on the scene?

28:48.727 --> 28:50.437
-Less than a year.
-JOHN: You know if your brother

28:50.520 --> 28:52.897
was at any time
romantically involved with Judith?

28:53.273 --> 28:54.941
-I doubt it.
-Why is that?

28:55.358 --> 28:57.902
She worked for him.
My brother gave me a lecture one time.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.363
He said, "Don’t mix business
and personal."

29:01.865 --> 29:04.492
That was way back when,
when he was trying to...

29:05.827 --> 29:07.328
tell me how to be a success.

29:08.496 --> 29:10.498
-Thanks, Jerry.
-We’ll let you know if we need anything.

you got up this morning, Enid?

The same time I always get up,
a quarter to six.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.943
-And what time did you go to breakfast?
-I didn’t go to breakfast.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.029
-Why was that?
-I don’t enjoy it.

29:41.696 --> 29:42.864
What don’t you enjoy?

29:43.114 --> 29:46.576
I don’t enjoy sitting at the table
where I used to sit.

29:46.826 --> 29:48.453
Why don’t you sit at another table?

29:48.536 --> 29:50.580
I’m assigned to table number five.

29:51.372 --> 29:53.833
And that’s the table
I’m required to sit at.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.960
Well, did you used to enjoy
sitting at table number five?

29:56.211 --> 29:58.338
-Yes.
-Why’d you stop sitting at the table?

29:58.713 --> 30:01.466
Because a certain individual moved in.

30:02.842 --> 30:05.470
And was invited
by another individual to sit there.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.224
And then this certain individual
proceeded to monopolize

30:09.307 --> 30:11.351
the other individual’s attention.

to come into a place

just to suit yourself?

-To my son’s.

-And this is the son who’s a veterinarian?
-How’d you know that?

weren’t you, Enid?

30:40.129 --> 30:41.172
Yes, I was.

you went to veterinarian school,

there were very few women who did that.

for the syringe in your room, Enid.

I gave up my veterinary practice,

31:23.590 --> 31:25.008

And then I went to work part time
for another veterinarian until I was 81.

I finally adjusted to that, too.

that I’m forced to adjust again.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.699
He asked if I wanted to do
some security work for him.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.367
What did you say?

33:14.450 --> 33:16.869
I said if we could work out the time,
I’d be open to it.

33:17.036 --> 33:19.122
-You’re kidding me, right?
-What’s wrong with that?

33:19.580 --> 33:21.874
-Do you not understand what he was doing?
-What was he doing?

33:22.041 --> 33:23.751
He hires you, it goes bad.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.796
-Now there’s a problem between you and me.
-How do you know it’s gonna go bad?

33:26.879 --> 33:28.256
I know my father.

33:28.339 --> 33:31.342
Everything is about manipulation.
Everything comes with an agenda.

33:31.634 --> 33:32.885
Okay, okay, I won’t do it.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.804
LORI: Which now he’s gonna know
because of me.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.681
He’s not gonna know.
I’ll say it was because of work.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.767
Next time, will you do me a favor?
Will you just check with me first?

33:44.313 --> 33:46.441
-Ready?
-Yeah.

33:55.241 --> 33:57.201
-What happened?
-She went for it.

33:57.618 --> 33:59.704
-This is this Enid woman?
-Right.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.921
I still want to go forward
with burglary charges against Eleanor.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.382
-You sure?
-What do you mean, "am I sure?" She stole.

34:11.674 --> 34:13.551
I think this was mostly
a crime of opportunity.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.053
Does that excuse it?

34:15.595 --> 34:18.056
-Puts it in perspective, anyway.
-It does nothing of the kind.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.850
My mother was vulnerable,
and she took advantage of that.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.853
-She took care of your mother.
-Are you saying I didn’t?

34:23.936 --> 34:26.606
No. You needed help,
and you got Eleanor to help you.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.274
BALDWIN: We talked to her judge

34:28.399 --> 34:30.318
and I don’t think there’s
any doubt in either of our minds

34:30.568 --> 34:32.653
that she did her best
to make your mother comfortable,

34:33.029 --> 34:36.491
-to keep her company.
-So just let her go then, right?

34:37.909 --> 34:39.118
It’s up to you.

34:42.997 --> 34:46.793
(SOBS) I think, probably,
that’s what my mother would want me to do.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.590
I think, probably you’re right.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.096
JUDITH: I thought you might be interested

34:58.221 --> 35:01.265
in some of Mr. Rasmussen’s
accomplishments over the years.

35:01.641 --> 35:02.725
Wow. You put that together?

35:02.975 --> 35:04.936
Not the kind of thing
he would do for himself.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.480
This is one of three cases
he argued in front

35:07.563 --> 35:08.773
of the United States Supreme Court.

35:09.774 --> 35:13.653
And this is him with Governor Rockefeller,
with Yitzhak Shamir.

35:13.736 --> 35:17.240
-Quite a career.
-Yes, it was quite a career.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.575
Judith, what time was it
you left your house this morning

35:19.700 --> 35:20.701
to come into the city?

35:20.952 --> 35:23.496
I said it was about 6:15, I believe.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.165
So the drive from Flushing
to Long Island City

35:26.249 --> 35:29.752
that time of day takes about a half-hour,
so that puts you there about 6:45.

35:29.836 --> 35:32.839
Can I ask why
this is an issue of such significance?

35:33.214 --> 35:35.007
We set up a timeline with everyone.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.760
So I’m assuming you got on the subway.
Where? Queensboro Plaza?

35:37.927 --> 35:38.970
Vernon-Jackson.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.389
So from there,
it’s one stop to Grand Central.

35:41.597 --> 35:44.267
I take it to 5th Avenue,
transfer to the F-train,

35:44.392 --> 35:46.310
which I take to West 4th Street.

35:46.394 --> 35:49.188
Which gets you into the Rasmussen
apartment around 7:30.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.065
Which is when I said I got there.

35:51.399 --> 35:54.569
Problem is, we checked
with the parking lot in Long Island City.

35:54.777 --> 35:57.155
-Why would you have done that?
-JOHN: It’s what we do.

35:57.321 --> 36:01.909
They have you parking your car at 5:45,
putting you in the city at 6:30.

36:02.285 --> 36:05.163
Well, I don’t know
that they’re correct about that.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.664
No, they have a stamped timecard.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.291
But even assuming that they are,

36:08.374 --> 36:10.877
I don’t always keep perfect track
of the time.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.462
-I’m always punctual.
-I think you do, Judith.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.506
I think you do keep perfect track
of the time.

36:15.923 --> 36:18.384
JOHN: So, you got there at 6:30
because you had overheard

36:18.467 --> 36:20.636
Amy making arrangements
to get picked up at that hour.

36:21.053 --> 36:23.139
You saw her get into the truck
with her old boyfriend,

36:23.222 --> 36:25.892
and you went up to the apartment
to deliver that news hot off the presses.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.476
I don’t know why I would do that.

36:27.727 --> 36:30.229
There’s no gratitude given
the bearer of bad news.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.732
With the wife running around on him
and you being loyal...

36:32.899 --> 36:34.483
Yes, I was loyal.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.652
You served him faithfully
for almost 30 years.

36:36.986 --> 36:39.071
And I was well rewarded for my service.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.282
Just wasn’t the reward
you were looking for.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.576
No, Mr. Rasmussen
was eminently fair with me.

36:43.910 --> 36:47.371
-Yeah, but he just married somebody else.
-As it was his prerogative to do.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.415
ANDY: Somebody else to live
in that beautiful apartment,

36:49.624 --> 36:51.042
while you commuted from Flushing.

36:51.167 --> 36:54.170
Somebody else to travel with him,
to stay in great hotels,

36:54.253 --> 36:57.632
to eat in fine restaurants,
somebody else to share his life.

36:57.924 --> 37:01.594
And why was that, huh?
I mean, because she had a great body?

37:01.928 --> 37:04.805
She knew him less than a year,
and she got him to marry her.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.599
And still, she was going out on him.

37:06.682 --> 37:09.268
Who the hell was she
to get away with all that?

37:11.062 --> 37:12.146
I don’t blame her.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.149
She’s a whore, and I mean that literally.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.609
She’s a woman who takes money for sex.

37:17.109 --> 37:19.237
But Mr. Rasmussen, on the other hand,
he knew better.

37:20.112 --> 37:22.073
He knew what it meant
to be a decent person.

37:22.281 --> 37:25.618
To recognize loyalty
and devotion and sacrifice.

37:26.452 --> 37:27.703
And he refused to do that.

37:28.454 --> 37:31.165
Instead, he let the base,
animal side of his nature,

37:31.249 --> 37:35.920
brush me aside in favor of what?
As you said, a great body.

37:36.087 --> 37:39.465
-Of course, you told him all that.
-JUDITH: I owed it to him to tell him.

37:39.632 --> 37:43.844
I owed it to him to make him aware
that people were laughing at him,

37:43.970 --> 37:45.429
that she was laughing at him.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.848
-She and her boyfriend both.
-But he didn’t listen.

37:47.974 --> 37:52.019
He told me that she was his wife,
and I had to accept that.

37:52.228 --> 37:55.356
He didn’t want me keeping an eye on her
and reporting back to him.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.817
He said it wasn’t my business.
My business!

37:58.109 --> 38:01.153
For almost 30 years, my business was him!

38:03.114 --> 38:04.991
Then he told me to take
the rest of the day off

38:05.449 --> 38:08.286
and... think about whether
or not I could be civil to Amy.

38:09.578 --> 38:11.664
To Amy! Because if I couldn’t,

38:12.081 --> 38:14.834
then he was gonna have to think
about making some changes.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.752
(SIGHS)

38:17.586 --> 38:20.965
That’s the way he put it,
"making some changes."

38:22.216 --> 38:24.218
So I covered his face with a pillow,

38:26.137 --> 38:27.930
that small, toothless face.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.684
And I held it there
until he stopped breathing.

38:33.644 --> 38:36.480
I deserved better than to have
Mr. Rasmussen speak to me like that.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.317
I... I really did.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.251
It was Judith who killed your husband.

38:59.295 --> 39:02.173
-I guess I should have seen that coming.
-Amy, so you know, your friend

39:02.465 --> 39:05.134
Richard was arrested
with a small amount of coke in his truck.

39:05.468 --> 39:08.346
He was ready to testify against you,
if there was a deal to be made.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.306
That also doesn’t much surprise me.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.476
JOHN: You got a lot of money now.
Money of your own.

39:14.143 --> 39:16.812
You’ll probably want to stay away
from people looking to hustle you.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.857
-Are there any other kind?
-Yeah.

39:21.275 --> 39:22.818
I guess Hugh was one, right?

39:23.361 --> 39:25.446
There will be others. Give it some time.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.075
I’ve never done too well, being on my own.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.041
-Good luck.
-Thank you, detective.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.478
Where did everybody go?

40:39.645 --> 40:41.439
Oh, I guess they headed over
to the ceremony.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.637
Atten-hut!

41:25.733 --> 41:27.067
