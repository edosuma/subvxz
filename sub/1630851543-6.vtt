wondering what I could do

05:58.191 --> 05:59.692
to make more money,

05:59.725 --> 06:03.295
because it seemed I had
no problem making it disappear.

06:03.329 --> 06:06.031
So I tried to hold on
to my cash

06:06.064 --> 06:10.737
by literally holding on to
my cash as tight as I could.

06:10.769 --> 06:16.442
But even then the money still
slipped through my fingers.

06:16.475 --> 06:19.946
[coin clangs]

06:19.978 --> 06:22.148
And so I did
what anybody would do.

06:22.180 --> 06:27.653
I got a boyfriend to,
you know, "share expenses."

06:27.687 --> 06:29.721
But the funny thing was,
every time we went out

06:29.755 --> 06:34.026
to dinner,
he "forgot his wallet." Mm-hmm.

06:34.060 --> 06:39.064
And more of my money
disappeared.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.500
So I said to myself,
"I'm a strong

06:41.533 --> 06:46.038
and resourceful woman.
I got this," so I got a job.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.106
In fact, I got lots of jobs,

06:48.141 --> 06:50.709
but everywhere
I went someone named FICA

06:50.742 --> 06:54.680
kept on taking money
out of my checks.

06:54.713 --> 06:57.250
Can you believe that?

06:57.283 --> 07:00.119
Can someone DM FICA for me?

07:00.153 --> 07:05.725
Tell her I'm paying her
back years ago.

07:05.757 --> 07:08.528
After trying so many jobs,

07:08.560 --> 07:13.833
I realized maybe the best job
for me is the one I have now

07:13.865 --> 07:15.500

07:15.535 --> 07:19.504

where the money goes

come back.

08:57.602 --> 08:59.938
You know, you mention
African-American.

08:59.971 --> 09:01.606
You mentioned female,
but you didn't mention

09:01.640 --> 09:03.408
the smallest minority
you're in,

09:03.442 --> 09:06.879
which is nobody
has lit up the room like you.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.847
You know,
that's just one of a kind.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.416
You're just wonderful

09:10.448 --> 09:13.653
how you did two solid minutes
of standup at the top,

09:13.686 --> 09:15.620
and it was not hack jokes
at all.

09:15.654 --> 09:19.091
It was not the usual
magician stuff, magician jokes.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.793
It was stuff that was really
particular to you

09:21.826 --> 09:23.895
and really, really good.

09:23.929 --> 09:28.533
And I can't believe that you're
just 19 and that skilled.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.369
It was just
a beautiful routine.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.836
Now, you gotta remember

09:31.870 --> 09:34.874
that Teller has been doing
the miser's dream,

09:34.907 --> 09:38.110
which is what
that's called in magic,

09:38.144 --> 09:39.412
a lot of the tricks
you're doing.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.514
He's been doing
the miser's dream

09:41.547 --> 09:44.649
three times longer
than you've been alive,

09:44.683 --> 09:46.686
and you did it so fresh.

09:46.719 --> 09:47.986
You know,
you weren't phoning it in.

09:48.019 --> 09:49.554
It wasn't remote control.
You were just going

09:49.588 --> 09:52.490
right through and really,
really doing the stuff.

09:52.524 --> 09:55.461
Really here. Really present.
Big personality.

09:55.494 --> 10:00.832
And we had never seen
signed coin to the bucket.

10:00.865 --> 10:02.434
You actually turned it
into something else

10:02.467 --> 10:04.736
with the signed coin,
which was really nice.

10:04.769 --> 10:06.138
And we really liked that,

10:06.172 --> 10:08.474
but the problem is that
there aren't many people

10:08.506 --> 10:10.942
who know more about
the miser's dream than Teller

10:10.976 --> 10:12.677
and how to produce
coins like that.

10:12.711 --> 10:15.715
So I want to just tell you
you're only 19.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.649
I would like you
to make me a promise.

10:17.682 --> 10:20.318
You didn't fool us this time,

10:20.352 --> 10:21.953
but you come back in a year
or two

10:21.988 --> 10:23.822
and really kick our ass.
Can you do that?

10:23.855 --> 10:26.091
- You got it.
As long as I entertained you,

10:26.125 --> 10:29.427

the bucket list.

This is the week of the 14th of
November, as you can see here.

34:38.175 --> 34:41.711
And this is the proverb
that says,

34:41.746 --> 34:44.782
"Kill not the goose
that lays the golden eggs,"

34:44.815 --> 34:48.385
and this is, of course,
an English proverb, right?

34:48.418 --> 34:50.554
- Yes.
- Now, just to show you that,

34:50.588 --> 34:52.824
if it shows,
I don't know, March.

34:52.856 --> 34:55.760
You see March we had
a completely different one,

34:55.793 --> 34:57.728
just to show you that they're
all different. That's...

34:57.762 --> 34:59.664
- Yes.
- Very important.

34:59.697 --> 35:02.599
Now, let me show you this.

35:02.632 --> 35:05.670
This clip here has been in
full view from the beginning,

35:05.702 --> 35:08.405
and if I show you what I wrote
before the show,

35:08.438 --> 35:10.141
I wrote exactly,

35:10.173 --> 35:14.311
"Kill not the goose
that lays the golden eggs."

35:14.344 --> 35:15.780
Thank you very much.

35:15.813 --> 35:18.282
Thank you, but I know
what you're thinking.

35:18.315 --> 35:22.186
You probably think that I have
52 different possibilities,

35:22.219 --> 35:24.889
and somehow I switched those
underneath the clip.

35:24.922 --> 35:27.692
Well, let me
give another proof.

35:27.724 --> 35:31.628
You see, just to prove
that I manipulated your minds,

35:31.661 --> 35:36.666
now, you can see that my body
double has a pocket scarf.

35:36.701 --> 35:41.304
Alyson, can you please
remove the pocket scarf

35:41.338 --> 35:45.208
and show everybody
what is printed there?

35:45.242 --> 35:47.177
- Okay. Oh...
- Yeah.

35:47.210 --> 35:51.315
- It's long.
What's printed on the scarf?

35:51.349 --> 35:55.418
- Yes.
- Aw. It's a--

35:55.452 --> 35:58.289
- It's a golden egg,
of course,

35:58.322 --> 36:01.559
because kill not the goose
that lays the golden eggs.

36:01.592 --> 36:02.960
Thank you very much.

36:02.994 --> 36:08.099
- Yay. Luca Volpe!

36:08.132 --> 36:10.034
- Grazia. Grazia.

36:10.067 --> 36:13.570
- Is it harder doing mentalism
from 8,000 miles away?

36:13.603 --> 36:16.373
- Yes. I have to say that
it is difficult, but, you know,

36:16.407 --> 36:20.010
during this lockdown
I'm quite used now

36:20.043 --> 36:22.980
to do things in front
of the camera remotely.

36:23.014 --> 36:27.518
- Is mental magic more about
mind reading or mind control?

36:27.552 --> 36:28.952
- You know, mentalists,
in reality,

36:28.985 --> 36:31.088
gives the illusion
to read people's mind,

36:31.121 --> 36:36.226
so a little bit you need
to control their behavior

36:36.260 --> 36:39.630
in order to make them
doing things that you want

36:39.664 --> 36:41.831
and look like that
you're reading their mind.

36:41.865 --> 36:46.304
Because you can actually blend
real stuff with some trickery,

36:46.336 --> 36:49.873
and it makes everything
a little bit more cool.

36:49.907 --> 36:54.211
- All right, Luca. Shall we see
if you fooled them?

36:54.244 --> 36:57.949
- Hey, Luca. Good to see you.
How are things over there?

36:57.981 --> 36:59.317
- Oh, very good. Very good.

36:59.349 --> 37:01.284
Very good. Thank you.
Nice to see you too.

37:01.318 --> 37:02.887
- You know, we're doing
this whole thing

37:02.920 --> 37:06.123
where we have people
from around the world

37:06.157 --> 37:10.860
on electronic calls here,
and having the cutout

37:10.894 --> 37:14.264
of you--the stand-in
of you--really smart idea.

37:14.297 --> 37:16.733
To really bring that here
and have that make it

37:16.766 --> 37:19.536
more three-dimensional here
for us was really good.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.972
It's a really nice trick
doing the influence thing.

37:22.005 --> 37:24.474
And I saw the ampersand
on the months,

37:24.507 --> 37:27.010
which was very nice,
and the numbers.

37:27.043 --> 37:30.146
It's all a really nice,
pleasant, sweet performance,

37:30.181 --> 37:32.250
and the thing right clear
in your pocket,

37:32.282 --> 37:35.619
from the very beginning
and then playing out over here.

37:35.652 --> 37:40.090
And we just really liked it,
and I'm gonna try to explain

37:40.123 --> 37:43.126
to you
how this was done in Italian.

37:43.159 --> 37:44.327
- Oh.
- So please...

37:44.362 --> 37:46.230
- Okay.
- Forgive me here.

37:55.773 --> 38:00.610

you fooled us, capisce?

38:00.644 --> 38:03.213
- Capisce.

What's got two sharp brains,

[cheers and applause]

38:48.458 --> 38:49.760
- For so many years now

38:49.793 --> 38:52.963
we've been doing big stage acts
with a big crew

38:52.996 --> 38:54.264
and a big theater
and everything.

38:54.297 --> 38:56.000
And we took some time recently

38:56.032 --> 38:58.034
and went back to
when we first met.

38:58.068 --> 38:59.737
We just got together
in each other's living rooms

38:59.769 --> 39:03.407
and just did sleight of hand,
just practiced and did magic.

39:03.440 --> 39:07.411
And we'd always wanted to do
a coin routine with four hands,

39:07.445 --> 39:09.880
so we worked this out.
It's all just sleight of hand.

39:09.914 --> 39:12.483
There's no gimmick coins
or anything, and watch this.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.985
There are four sections
on the mat, okay?

39:15.018 --> 39:19.456
One. Two. Three and four.
And there are four coins.

39:19.489 --> 39:22.659
One. Two. Three and four.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.929
And of course,
we have our four hands.

39:24.961 --> 39:27.864
To keep track of those,
they are one,

39:27.898 --> 39:31.601
two, three,

39:31.635 --> 39:36.507
and four.

39:36.539 --> 39:38.041
Here we go.

39:38.074 --> 39:42.213
Now, if one, meaning the hand,
has two, meaning the coins,

39:42.246 --> 39:45.449
and two, meaning the hand,
has two.

39:45.483 --> 39:47.550
And one goes to two,
meaning the zone,

39:47.585 --> 39:50.954
and two goes to one,
now one has three.

39:50.987 --> 39:56.994
And two just one.
Now, if three has three

39:57.027 --> 40:00.097
and two has one
and two goes to three

40:00.130 --> 40:02.932
and three goes to one,
then two has two.

40:02.967 --> 40:05.402
And three has two.

40:05.436 --> 40:08.371
Now, four has two,

40:08.405 --> 40:10.474
and three has two.

40:10.507 --> 40:12.409
And two and four
go to one and three,

40:12.443 --> 40:14.445
and one and three
goes to two and four.

40:14.478 --> 40:19.750
Now, three has three
and four just one.

40:19.784 --> 40:25.456
Now, if one has three
and four has one

40:25.489 --> 40:27.625
and one and three go back
to one and three

40:27.657 --> 40:30.059
and two and four go back to two
and four,

40:30.094 --> 40:32.630
now one has all four.

40:32.663 --> 40:35.065
Damn.

40:35.099 --> 40:38.436
Now four has one,
and two has one,

40:38.469 --> 40:41.704
and three has one,
and one has one.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.273
And one goes all
the way to four,

40:43.306 --> 40:44.775
and
four goes all the way to one.

40:44.809 --> 40:46.976
And three goes to two,
and two goes to three.

40:47.010 --> 40:50.213
Now four and three have
two and two.

40:50.246 --> 40:52.349
We'd better do that
for you again, right?

40:52.382 --> 40:55.085
Now four has one,
and three has one,

40:55.119 --> 40:57.521
and two has one,
and one has one.

40:57.554 --> 41:00.324
And four goes back to four,
and one goes back to one.

41:00.356 --> 41:03.059
And three goes back to two,
and two goes back to three.

41:03.092 --> 41:06.030
Then four and three have
two and two.

41:06.063 --> 41:10.400
And finally, if three has two
and two has two

41:10.434 --> 41:12.235
and four is four
and three is three

41:12.268 --> 41:15.840
and two is two and one is one,
now one has one,

41:15.873 --> 41:17.474
and two has one,
and three has one,

41:17.507 --> 41:22.112
