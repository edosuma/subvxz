WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.003
Jeff: Welcome to the finale

00:04.003 --> 00:07.975
of "survivor: Heroes vs. Healers
vs. Hustlers."

00:08.007 --> 00:10.978
We are live, CBS television city
in Los Angeles.

00:11.011 --> 00:15.116
And this is really a "survivor"
fan's fantasy.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.984
We haves set up on the lop.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.987
We have fans playing against
some of our most popular

00:20.020 --> 00:20.854
players.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.656
Andrea's out there, Cochran's
out there.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.959
It's starting to rain, which is
perfect for "survivor."

00:25.993 --> 00:29.463
You guys, come in.

00:29.497 --> 00:30.164
Get in!

00:30.198 --> 00:31.399
They're going to miss the show.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.135
All right, our first season...
think about this... aired in the

00:34.168 --> 00:36.670
summer of 2000, 17 years ago.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.473
And many of you have been
watching with us from the start.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.309
You've never missed a season.

00:41.342 --> 00:44.612
You've never midst an episode,
and now, a lot of you are

00:44.645 --> 00:47.881
watching with your kids, which
is awesome, because "survivor"

00:47.915 --> 00:49.650
can play on so many levels.

00:49.683 --> 00:53.354
On one hand, you have this
fantastic social, political game

00:53.387 --> 00:56.724
of human chess with strategy and
deceit.

00:56.757 --> 01:01.562
But it can also inspire this: A
sense of adventure, where kids

01:01.595 --> 01:05.166
that are watching imagine
themselves in the jungle making

01:05.199 --> 01:06.900
fire, catching fish.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.837
And as you've seen over the last
few years, it happens... those

01:09.870 --> 01:12.140
kids, watching now... yes, I'm
talking to you.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.375
You grow up, and you end up on
the show.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.476
It can happen.

01:15.509 --> 01:19.380
All right, let's get to this
season and our live studio

01:19.413 --> 01:20.481
audience.

01:20.514 --> 01:24.418
( Cheers and applause )
Hottest ticket in town.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.920
All right!

01:26.954 --> 01:31.091
So this season... have a seat,
guys.

01:31.125 --> 01:31.992
Have a seat!

01:32.025 --> 01:34.128
This season, we started with
three tribes.

01:34.162 --> 01:37.165
And by design, the idea was
let's put a lot of secrets in

01:37.198 --> 01:37.998
the game.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.068
That's what our big creative
idea was.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.035
Let's have secrets.

01:42.069 --> 01:44.205
They'll be everywhere.

01:44.238 --> 01:47.040
They'll blindside each other
with secrets and then nobody in

01:47.074 --> 01:50.578
this game could keep a single
secret pup never know what

01:50.611 --> 01:51.245
they're going to do.

01:51.279 --> 01:54.114
We lost some favorites early.

01:54.148 --> 02:00.788
Katrina, Simone, Allen, Jessica,
Patrick, Ali, and even roark,

02:00.821 --> 02:02.055
went home early.

02:02.089 --> 02:05.593
You don't come out here and give
up everything to leave early but

02:05.626 --> 02:06.960
that's the way the game goes.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.461
And we have our jury.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.297
Movie our jury.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.830
We have a couple of spots left.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.000
Once you get to the jury phase,
it gets complicated.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.303
Because even though they're out
of the game, they ultimately

02:15.336 --> 02:17.905
have the final say in who wins
because it's their votes and

02:17.938 --> 02:25.045
they're going to be choosing
between three of our final five.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.647
Devon, man, looking studley.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.915
Look at that.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.817
Dr. Mike, we've got Ben.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.751
Ryan.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.787
And the only woman left in the
game, Chrissy.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.725
( Cheers and applause )
All right, so let's set it up.

02:37.758 --> 02:41.529
At this point now there are 35
days in, they're running on

02:41.562 --> 02:42.696
fumes.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.931
But everybody's still in it,
because each of the five could

02:43.964 --> 02:47.601
make a case right now about why
they deserve to win this game.

02:47.635 --> 02:51.372
Seats really going to come down
to who they're sitting next to,

02:51.405 --> 02:54.442
which is why every decision you
make on "survivor" matters.

02:54.475 --> 02:57.345
We are are really excited to
share tonight with you.

02:57.378 --> 03:00.013
It's an epic final episode, one
of the best ever.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.816
And you are going to see a
battle to the very end.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.418
Let's get to it.

03:04.452 --> 03:14.795
The finale, "survivor: Heroes
vs. Healers vs. Hustlers."

03:14.828 --> 03:19.166
* *
Jeff: 35 days ago, in the

03:26.440 --> 03:35.283
islands of Fiji, six heroes, six
healers, and six hustlers.

03:35.316 --> 03:39.253
It begins now.

03:39.287 --> 03:39.620
"Survivor's" on.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.821
Let's go!

03:40.854 --> 03:42.055
Began a season of "survivor"
that would be fueled by secrets.

03:42.089 --> 03:45.393
I see something labeled
"secret advantage."

03:45.426 --> 03:48.262
I was like woo-hoo!

03:48.296 --> 03:50.063
Jeff: An early secret was
shared.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.799
Oh, my gosh.

03:51.832 --> 03:55.336
"Someone has secretly chosen you
to receive a super idol."

03:55.369 --> 03:57.405
Jeff: Is and forged a
lasting relationship.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.973
So you and I are going to
have to be friend.

04:00.007 --> 04:00.808
Yes.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.477
Jeff: But sharing secrets
is tricky.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.913
Confide in the wrong people...

04:05.946 --> 04:09.082
And they'll use it against you.

04:09.116 --> 04:12.853
Wow.

04:12.886 --> 04:17.591
Jeff: At tribal council,
new advantages...

04:17.625 --> 04:21.661
"this is being used against
to you block your vote."

04:21.695 --> 04:23.731
Jeff: ...Required bigger
risks.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.899
I hope using this works.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.901
Jeff: ...Resulting in
surprising moves.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.470
Well, this is the real idol.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.038
And it will never be played.

04:31.071 --> 04:35.175
Jeff: And a series of
devastating blindsides.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.645
The tribe has spoken.

04:37.678 --> 04:42.783
And sometimes, the best-laid
plans fell to the best help kept

04:42.816 --> 04:43.617
secrets.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.218
I'm going to play this for
myself.

04:45.252 --> 04:48.489
Jeff: This is a hidden
immunity idol.

04:48.522 --> 04:53.093
At the last tribal council, a
"survivor" first...

04:53.126 --> 04:55.496
I'm in the final five, Jeff.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.097
Jeff: This is a hidden
immunity idol.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.168
He's playing it early as a sign
of power.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.302
...sent a clear signal...

05:02.336 --> 05:04.905
I just turned the five
against themselves.

05:04.938 --> 05:08.576
Jeff: This season will be a
battle to the end.

05:08.609 --> 05:13.447
Now, only five remain.

05:13.481 --> 05:18.719
Ben, this American hero is a
strategic powerhouse, but his

05:18.752 --> 05:21.822
bold and aggressive game play
has turned him into public enemy

05:21.855 --> 05:23.691
number one.

05:23.724 --> 05:27.661
With now allies left in the
game, can he find a way to keep

05:27.695 --> 05:28.295
his torch lit?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.630
I'm not going to give up.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.864
I'm going to keep trying.

05:30.898 --> 05:34.001
And I'm going to go look around
this island for another idol,

05:34.034 --> 05:38.472
and if I can't find it, I'm
going to do my best to win

05:38.506 --> 05:38.872
immunity.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.140
Jeff: Mike.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.010
He's the only healer left in the
game, and despite being excluded

05:43.043 --> 05:48.348
from nearly every vote, this
doctor has found a way to stay

05:48.382 --> 05:49.450
alive.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.819
With the end in sight, can Mike
rise to the occasion?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.854
I'm running on fumes.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.355
But I'm ecstatic.

05:55.389 --> 06:00.494
I'm on day 37 of "survivor," and
it's like nobody realizes that

06:00.528 --> 06:04.331
I'm gonna win.

06:04.364 --> 06:08.769
Jeff: Devon, true to his
nature, he has hustled his way

06:08.802 --> 06:12.940
through the game, controlling
votes and orchestrating

06:12.973 --> 06:14.207
blindsides.

06:14.241 --> 06:17.545
But with only five players left,
will that grit be enough to get

06:17.578 --> 06:18.712
him to the end?

06:18.746 --> 06:21.982
I'm sort of seeing my destiny
unfold.

06:22.015 --> 06:25.185
This whole game, I've been in a
power seat.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.554
I've been making decisions.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.289
I've manipulated people, but I
ain't backing down.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.725
I'm going for the million.

06:31.759 --> 06:32.826
Jeff: Ryan.

06:32.860 --> 06:36.229
This super fan's knowledge of
the game helped him find

06:36.263 --> 06:38.766
advantages and idols.

06:38.799 --> 06:43.103
But it's his strong social
abilities and his alliance with

06:43.136 --> 06:45.172
Chrissy that have kept him in
the game.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.874
Will that loyalty pay off?

06:46.907 --> 06:51.078
As a super fan, final five is
not good enough.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.379
Second place isn't good enough.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.882
I need to win this game.

06:54.915 --> 06:59.152
Jeff: Chrissy, a rough
start nearly sent her home, but

06:59.186 --> 07:02.556
she recovered and seized early
control of the game.

07:02.590 --> 07:09.463
When the tides turned again, she
had to win immunity to stay

07:09.497 --> 07:09.997
alive.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.500
Chrissy pulls it out!

07:12.533 --> 07:14.301
Chrissy wins individual
immunity!

07:14.334 --> 07:18.105
Now this resilient mom is the
only woman left in the game.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.640
Will her roller coaster journey
end on a high?

07:19.673 --> 07:23.210
The finish is going to be
absolutely incredible.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.411
We have so close.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.981
There are so many combinations
that could happen.

07:28.015 --> 07:31.719
I hope we can pull it off in a
joyful manner.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.621
Of course, it's "survivor," so
that will never happen.

07:33.654 --> 07:37.758
Jeff: Who will have what it
takes to outwit, outplay, and

07:37.791 --> 07:41.128
outlast all the rest to win the
million-dollar prize and the

07:41.161 --> 07:49.136
title of "sole survivor?"

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:10.558 --> 08:13.661
thank you.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.929
Did Ben just take off?

08:15.963 --> 08:18.298
Is he looking for the next
idol?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.833
There can't be another one.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.101
I don't think there is
another one.

08:21.134 --> 08:25.505
The fact that Ben played his
idol, means he now has no idol,

08:25.539 --> 08:26.674
which is lovely.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.976
And, frankly, I'm happy that
Ashley is gone.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.078
So it worked out just fine for
me.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.582
And now I am in a group of five
where four people have the exact

08:34.615 --> 08:36.650
same target... Ben.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.552
I can't believe he found another
idol.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.388
I mean, that really is skill.

08:41.421 --> 08:45.926
Ben is like the bad guy in
any horror movie... I just keep

08:45.959 --> 08:48.128
trying to kill him, and he keeps
coming back to life.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.964
Not even entertain hearing
him out.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.165
That's what I would recommend.

08:52.199 --> 08:52.866
Yeah.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.101
One of us must win tomorrow.

08:54.134 --> 08:54.501
I know.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.069
Oh, yeah.

08:56.103 --> 08:56.770
Oh, yeah.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.972
Ben needs to leave this game.

08:59.006 --> 08:59.807
He's very dangerous.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.375
You know, I don't mean the $1
million.

09:02.409 --> 09:06.146
I'm playing to win "survivor"
because I am going to be the

09:06.179 --> 09:07.981
ultimate "survivor."

09:08.015 --> 09:12.519
Ben's playing because he feels
this need to win this money for

09:12.552 --> 09:15.823
his family, which makes him
ferocious.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.158
Hopefully he doesn't find
that idol.

09:18.191 --> 09:24.197
It was a long tribal, and now
we get to sleep.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.232
I agree.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.499
Bring it in.

09:26.533 --> 09:30.270
Let's finish it.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.674
I wonder where he is.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.043
I'm vulnerable, you know.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.444
I have no protection now.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.046
I have no alliance.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.314
And I know they're gunning for
me.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.752
The only thing that could blow
up their game is if I find

09:44.785 --> 09:47.154
another idol.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.089
It is absolutely crazy.

09:49.122 --> 09:49.857
Nobody followed me.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.124
They're feeling too comfortable.

09:51.158 --> 09:55.162
I don't know why because an idol
can be played until five, so as

09:55.195 --> 09:58.732
long as my heart is beating, I'm
looking for an idol.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.167
Everybody's sleeping.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.871
Everybody's zonked out, cozy
with their blankets and pillows,

10:03.904 --> 10:06.439
and I'm out here for my family.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.375
So there ain't no time for
sleeping or rest.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.343
This is more than a game to me,
you know.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.544
This is a mission.

10:11.578 --> 10:18.018
This is a job.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.004
I'm so exhausted.

10:37.037 --> 10:41.108
I'm trying to hold my eyes open,
and I just can't.

10:41.141 --> 10:41.842
I looked everywhere.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.376
And I can't find this thing.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.546
You know, I feel like I'm
letting my wife down.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.783
But I know she'll be proud of me
for how hard I tried.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.885
I'm not just going to roll over
and die.

10:51.919 --> 10:55.222
But my back supagainst the wall.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.924
Oh, my gosh!

10:56.957 --> 10:58.025
No way!

10:58.058 --> 10:59.326
No way!

10:59.359 --> 11:01.161
No way!

11:01.194 --> 11:03.230
Are you kidding me?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.364
Are you kidding me?

11:04.397 --> 11:07.434
I was about to get some sleep,
and literally, right there

11:07.467 --> 11:11.805
behind me, is the ding mark on
the gosh darn raft that I've

11:11.839 --> 11:13.473
been looking for, forever.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.308
No way!

11:15.342 --> 11:17.945
Are you kidding me?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.446
I can't believe this.

11:19.479 --> 11:24.217
I cannot believe this.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.053
Oh, my god!

11:26.086 --> 11:29.122
Number three, baby.

11:29.156 --> 11:33.160
This idol guarantees me a spot
in the final four and, you know,

11:33.193 --> 11:36.029
Ryan, Devon, Chrissy and Mike
think they have control of the

11:36.063 --> 11:39.767
game, but I'll be dropping a big
old Ben bomb at the end of

11:39.800 --> 11:40.367
tribal.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.534
You think I'm going home?

11:41.568 --> 11:43.570
Watch this.

13:18.798 --> 13:23.503
* *
all right.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.790
Nice job, Devon.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.025
Sleep all right last night?

13:45.058 --> 13:46.793
I slept all right.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.230
Oh, yeah.

13:50.263 --> 13:54.567
My relationship with Ben is
so incredibly complex.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.804
We were friends to the end, and
now we can't stand each other.

13:57.837 --> 14:02.775
So I decide that I'm going to
approach Ben and simply make up

14:02.809 --> 14:04.311
with him.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.845
Can we be friends again?

14:05.879 --> 14:08.181
Totally.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.283
Yeah.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.019
Come here, honey.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.622
We hugged it out and, you
know, now I suppose we're

14:15.655 --> 14:16.723
friends.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.426
But, honestly, it is only for
game play at this point.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.293
I really did miss you.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.029
I missed you, too.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.430
I missed talking with you.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.098
I missed sleeping next to you.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.068
Now we sleep next to each
other but with eight feet

14:28.101 --> 14:28.368
between us.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.636
Yeah.

14:29.669 --> 14:35.708
Truthfully, I still don't
trust Ben at all, but for game

14:35.742 --> 14:38.511
play, I needed to have him think
that we were working our way

14:38.545 --> 14:39.679
towards a better relationship.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.515
Because in the event he wins
immunity, I just need to make

14:42.549 --> 14:43.783
sure I get to the final four.

14:43.816 --> 14:50.991
If you win today, would you ever
consider this: Would you rather

14:51.024 --> 14:53.360
give the final three to the
final three best players in the

14:53.393 --> 14:54.494
game?

14:54.527 --> 14:56.496
Well, that's the... like...
you know what I'm saying?

14:56.529 --> 14:57.830
Well, I don't know.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.099
I don't know.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.001
I'm not stupid.

15:01.034 --> 15:05.305
Chrissy's trying to finagle her
way in, if I win individual

15:05.338 --> 15:06.073
immunity.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.607
And it ain't going to work at
all.

15:07.640 --> 15:12.179
If you win, immunity today, are
you going to take me?

15:12.212 --> 15:12.980
I don't think so.

15:13.013 --> 15:13.713
Yeah.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.048
You know what I mean?

15:15.082 --> 15:18.251
Okay, so just in the idea
anyway that if you end up...

15:18.285 --> 15:19.219
yeah.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.887
I'll give it to the lady, props
to her.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.755
At least she's trying.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.658
But you're barking up the wrong
tree there, sister.

15:25.692 --> 15:29.662
Chrissy is my biggest
competitor.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.332
She's building a resume at this
point.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.767
She could win the million
dollars.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.236
It's just something to think
about.

15:36.269 --> 15:41.208
I don't want her in the game
any long longer.

15:41.241 --> 15:51.284
I'm going to play my idol and
she's gone.

15:51.284 --> 15:59.826
I'm going to play my idol and
she's gone.

15:59.859 --> 16:02.595
Jeff: All right, shall we
get to today's immunity dismj.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.164
Yes.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.533
Jeff: Chrissy for the
second time, I have to take it

16:06.566 --> 16:09.036
back.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.403
Hope to see you soon.

16:10.437 --> 16:11.304
Jeff: All right.

16:11.338 --> 16:16.343
Raonce again, immunity is back u
for grabs.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.846
For today's challenge, you're
going to swim out to a platform,

16:19.879 --> 16:27.054
climb up a stack of crates, leap
off, and retrieve a set of keys.

16:27.087 --> 16:31.158
You'll then cross a balance beam
and retrieve a second set of

16:31.191 --> 16:32.459
keys.

16:32.492 --> 16:38.098
You'llize thoyou'll use those ke
your puzzle.

16:38.131 --> 16:41.234
Finally, you'll maneuver balls
to match the corresponding

16:41.268 --> 16:42.502
color.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.505
First person to line their balls
up with the colors on the wheel,

16:45.538 --> 16:49.942
wins immunity, guaranteed a spot
in the final four.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.945
Losers, tribal council, where
somebody will become the seventh

16:52.979 --> 16:54.547
member of our jury.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.717
In addition, you're playing for
reward.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.086
Yes!

16:59.119 --> 17:00.553
Jeff: You want to know what
you're playing for?

17:00.587 --> 17:01.754
Yes.

17:01.788 --> 17:05.224
Jeff: The winner will enjoy
back at camp good old comfort

17:05.258 --> 17:05.825
food.

17:05.858 --> 17:06.893
Chicken, mashed potatoes.

17:06.925 --> 17:07.993
Oh!

17:08.027 --> 17:09.729
Jeff: Gravy, veggies.

17:09.762 --> 17:10.863
Oh, my!

17:10.896 --> 17:13.233
Jeff: Wine, and cheesecake
for dessert.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.166
Cheesecake!

17:14.201 --> 17:15.301
That's my favorite!

17:15.335 --> 17:18.438
Jeff: Big boost going into
these last few days, huge

17:18.471 --> 17:19.106
stakes.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.840
I know it's worth playing for.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.477
We'll draw for sports.

17:24.511 --> 17:29.582
We'll get started.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.320
All right, here we go.

17:33.353 --> 17:38.191
For immunity, a guaranteed spot
in the final four, and reward.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.394
Survivors ready?

17:41.428 --> 17:48.067
Go!

17:48.101 --> 17:52.004
Your first step is to retrieve
those first set of keys.

17:52.038 --> 17:55.242
Devon flying through it, takes
his leap, he's got it.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.309
Ryan has his!

17:56.343 --> 17:57.377
Mike has his!

17:57.410 --> 17:58.978
Ben's got his!

17:59.011 --> 18:02.649
Chrissy last to get there.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.685
Chrissy has hers.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.421
Everybody now has their first
set.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.424
Devon now on to the beam.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.193
Ryan crawling out.

18:13.226 --> 18:13.960
Ryan drops.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.061
He's got to go back.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.264
Mike is going to crawl across
that beam.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.566
Here comes Chrissy, dead last.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.935
Ben now on the beam.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.705
It is Devon working on those
knots.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.740
Mike working on the knots.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.510
Devon trying to hang in there,
he can't.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.778
Devon's got to go back.

18:31.811 --> 18:35.114
And it's going to go Mike first
across with his second set of

18:35.148 --> 18:35.748
keys.

18:35.782 --> 18:39.719
Who would have guessed that!

18:39.752 --> 18:40.553
Devon's across.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.556
You're good!

18:43.590 --> 18:44.824
Ryan drops again.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.058
He's got to go back.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.928
Devon and Mike reach the final
stage.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.663
Unlock your puzzle!

18:50.697 --> 18:52.131
Here comes Chrissy.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.601
She is quickly trying to make up
ground.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.735
Ben is across now.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.003
He's good.

18:57.036 --> 19:00.673
It is now Ryan left alone trying
to get across that beam with his

19:00.707 --> 19:03.976
second set of keys.

19:04.010 --> 19:07.714
Now you've got to find which key
openopens that puzzle and start

19:07.747 --> 19:13.386
solving it.

19:13.420 --> 19:13.953
Ryan's across.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.523
He's good!

19:16.556 --> 19:18.391
Chrissy has her puzzle unlocked.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.693
She is quickly back in this.

19:20.727 --> 19:24.397
You've got to maneuver the balls
through the middle and match it

19:24.431 --> 19:27.033
with the corresponding color.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.968
Ryan last to get here.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.839
Now he's got to get his puzzle
unlocked.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.375
Ben has his puzzle unlocked.

19:35.408 --> 19:39.879
Mike was first to get across,
but has lost a lot of time

19:39.912 --> 19:42.282
trying to find the key to open
his puzzle.

19:42.315 --> 19:47.554
Now Mike's in it.

19:47.587 --> 19:51.958
Another complicated and
brand-new "survivor" puzzle.

19:51.991 --> 19:55.695
You're going to spin that wheel
and move the balls around until

19:55.728 --> 20:00.233
all of the balls line up with
all of the matching colors.

20:00.267 --> 20:05.037
Once you start figuring out how
this works, you can start moving

20:05.071 --> 20:06.239
fast.

20:06.273 --> 20:09.476
But the key to this challenge is
you have to be able to look

20:09.509 --> 20:12.379
several moves ahead and figure
out where these balls need to

20:12.412 --> 20:15.382
get to and how to get them
there.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.616
Mike moving nicely now.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.252
He's got something going.

20:19.286 --> 20:22.855
Chrissy has been moving fast
from the beginning, like she

20:22.889 --> 20:24.056
knows this puzzle.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.192
Ben now moving nicely.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.428
Ben is making progress.

20:28.461 --> 20:33.500
It is Ben, Chrissy, and Mike
right now, with Ryan and Devon

20:33.533 --> 20:34.801
getting lost.

20:34.834 --> 20:40.307
The only person left in the game
that has won an immunity is

20:40.340 --> 20:40.707
Chrissy.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.974
She's won two.

20:42.008 --> 20:45.378
Immunity at tribal is the single
greatest feeling you can have at

20:45.412 --> 20:46.546
tribal.

20:46.579 --> 20:51.284
The only way to make sure you
live to see day 38 is right

20:51.318 --> 20:52.485
here.

20:52.519 --> 20:56.956
This could come down to a few
moves, and who will get there

20:56.989 --> 21:00.226
first.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.761
Jeff.

21:01.794 --> 21:09.736
Jeff: Chrissy thinks she
has it.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.837
Chrissy has it!

21:10.870 --> 21:15.308
Chrissy wins individual
immunity, guaranteed a spot in

21:15.342 --> 21:23.015
the final four and a nice reward
back at camp!

21:23.049 --> 21:24.351
Nice job, Chrissy.

21:24.384 --> 21:29.356
Thank you.

21:31.190 --> 21:35.094
Jeff: Chrissy, come on
over.

21:35.127 --> 21:39.599
Third individual immunity win
puts you within one of the

21:39.632 --> 21:42.669
record on "survivor" by women in
this game at four.

21:42.702 --> 21:47.574
More importantly, guarantees you
a spot in the final four, one

21:47.607 --> 21:49.409
step closer to the end.

21:49.442 --> 21:52.512
And you have reward back at
camp.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.814
Comfort food for one would be
nice with two.

21:54.847 --> 21:58.651
Bring one person to join you.

21:58.685 --> 22:03.089
I would like to bring doctor
Mike.

22:03.122 --> 22:05.692
Jeff: Doctor Mike come on
over.

22:05.725 --> 22:06.459
Thank you.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.827
I went with him on the last
one.

22:07.860 --> 22:08.961
Thank you.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.498
Jeff: All right, Chrissy,
there is enough food for one

22:11.531 --> 22:12.264
more.

22:12.298 --> 22:13.700
I think I'd like to bring
Devon.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.167
Jeff: Devon, come on over.

22:15.201 --> 22:15.568
Join us.

22:15.602 --> 22:16.035
Thank you.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.236
You're welcome.

22:17.269 --> 22:20.440
Jeff: All right, so back at
camp, you guys will enjoy the

22:20.473 --> 22:21.307
food.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.810
Ryan and Ben, you'll enjoy...
nothing.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.045
Jeff: You're right, I got
nothing for you.

22:26.078 --> 22:29.015
Somebody going home tonight will
become the seventh member of our

22:29.048 --> 22:29.516
jury.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.150
It will not be you.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.351
Congrats.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.754
Grab your stf, head back to
camp, see you tonight at tribal.

22:34.787 --> 22:37.123
Chrissy is unbeatable.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.324
I'm bummed she won because I was
gunning for her.

22:38.357 --> 22:42.328
I just have to figure out the
best way to use this idol and

22:42.361 --> 22:44.363
make a decision on who is going

23:09.321 --> 23:11.323
* *
oh, my god.

23:12.324 --> 23:13.292
Oh, we each have our own
chicken!

23:13.325 --> 23:14.427
Are you serious?

23:14.461 --> 23:17.430
Guys, do you think...
we each have our own chicken.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.766
Do you think there's a clue
here to the idol.

23:19.799 --> 23:24.003
I think there might be a clue
here so can we just look for two

23:24.036 --> 23:24.471
seconds.

23:24.504 --> 23:25.171
There might be.

23:25.204 --> 23:28.608
Look under all the chickens.

23:28.641 --> 23:35.314
No chickens, no napkins.

23:35.347 --> 23:36.048
We're good.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.551
Let's eat.

23:38.585 --> 23:42.388
If Ben somehow can find
another idol, then this game

23:42.421 --> 23:43.623
could blow up yet again.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.893
So the first thing we did at the
reward was went through every

23:46.926 --> 23:49.028
scrap of everything looking for
a clue, and there was nothing.

23:49.061 --> 23:52.732
With kwe please cheers to us
three and Ryan being final four.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.700
Yes!

23:53.733 --> 23:54.233
Oh, yes!

23:54.266 --> 23:55.401
Okay.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.838
Tonight's tribal council is
about trimming the fat, and

23:58.871 --> 24:00.106
getting to the final four.

24:00.139 --> 24:04.043
My entire game at this point is
focused around getting Ben out.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.278
So can we discuss the
possibility of Ben playing

24:06.312 --> 24:07.680
another freaking idol tonight?

24:07.714 --> 24:09.081
No way.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.449
I'm voting Ben.

24:10.483 --> 24:11.317
I'm voting Ben.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.585
I'm voting Ben.

24:12.619 --> 24:16.989
And if I go because he plays
the third idol in a row, then so

24:17.023 --> 24:18.124
be if.

24:18.157 --> 24:22.228
Yeah, but good for us, that
Ryan is baby-sitting Ben.

24:22.261 --> 24:26.232
So you got baby sitting
duties while they're off eating.

24:26.265 --> 24:30.336
That's the way they figured,
huh?

24:30.369 --> 24:31.003
It does kind of suck.

24:31.037 --> 24:31.971
You're telling me.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.239
Yeah.

24:33.272 --> 24:40.379
If we could find the immunity
idol, and I'll wear the immunity

24:40.412 --> 24:44.316
necklace, then we'll give
someone the dead super immunity

24:44.350 --> 24:45.017
necklace.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.185
And just be like, "sorry, dude."

24:46.218 --> 24:47.319
Hold on.

24:47.353 --> 24:50.189
You have a necklace associated
with your super immunity?

24:50.222 --> 24:51.257
It's dead.

24:51.290 --> 24:54.093
It's been... it only was... it
only was good for a day.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.562
We could plant it.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.697
But we can, one, plant it.

24:57.730 --> 25:02.735
Or, two, we can tell Ben we had
a clue and found the idol.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.270
It would be like, Ben you're
done.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.104
Perfect.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.606
I mean, this is the best plan
ever.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.941
It's going to make... it's going
to shut him down.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.677
He'll just lay in the shelter
all day.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.779
How fun would that be?

25:12.812 --> 25:15.882
Ben has proven himself to be
incredible at finding idols.

25:15.915 --> 25:22.021
So the plan is simply to use
that dead super immunity idol

25:22.054 --> 25:24.857
that Ryan gave me at the first
tribal council, put it together

25:24.891 --> 25:29.862
with the instructions from
Ryan's actual idol that was

25:29.896 --> 25:31.097
played.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.432
And tell Ben that we found the
idol so that he'll stop looking

25:33.465 --> 25:34.266
this afternoon.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.536
It's so brilliant.

25:37.570 --> 25:40.607
I'm going to go fill my
water.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.708
I'm going to start looking.

25:41.741 --> 25:46.813
Don't waste too much energy.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.281
What is that?

25:49.315 --> 25:51.417
Wow!

25:51.450 --> 25:51.784
Well done.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.085
No way!

25:53.119 --> 25:54.854
For real?

25:54.887 --> 25:55.688
You found an idol?

25:55.722 --> 25:57.389
It was more than a reward.

25:57.423 --> 26:02.328
Let me see... let me see the
paper.

26:02.361 --> 26:04.864
Oh, wow.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.198
That's a fancy one, too.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.902
I'm just telling you, you
might as well not waste your

26:09.936 --> 26:10.502
energy.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.872
I mean, save your energy.

26:12.905 --> 26:17.309
An idol at a reward, huh?

26:17.343 --> 26:19.078
Nothing like two in one day.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.512
( Laughs )
Well.

26:20.546 --> 26:24.116
I don't know which one I'll
wear on top, but, clearly, I'll

26:24.150 --> 26:25.417
be giving this one away tonight.

26:25.451 --> 26:25.985
To me?

26:26.018 --> 26:26.585
No.

26:26.619 --> 26:29.488
Well, that's a downer.

26:29.521 --> 26:34.694
I figured if I didn't win today,
I was going home anyway.

26:34.727 --> 26:41.500
Well, I'm going to go get some
water.

26:41.533 --> 26:44.937
I would say that went well.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.739
( Louvres )
That was so good.

26:46.773 --> 26:52.011
Oh, man, he bought it hook,
line, and sinker, and it really

26:52.044 --> 26:53.445
worked to perfection.

26:53.479 --> 26:56.716
He was shocked, and that let us
all know he does not have a

26:56.749 --> 26:59.351
hidden immunity idol, which is a
very good thing.

26:59.385 --> 27:00.586
Are you kidding me?

27:00.619 --> 27:04.824
There ain't no way it's a real
idol because I got the one in my

27:04.857 --> 27:05.191
boot.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.026
Oh, my god.

27:07.059 --> 27:10.930
How epic is this?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.032
"Well don't waste too much
energy."

27:13.065 --> 27:14.967
Classic, classic.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.536
It's a good-looking fake idol,
too.

27:17.569 --> 27:20.272
Now I don't even have to fake
look for idols no more.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.842
She just made my job easier.

27:22.875 --> 27:23.776
Yeah, two-fer.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.178
Got me a two-fer.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.914
Nope, no, you didn't.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.448
You got a one-fer.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.151
I'm one step haefd them through
this whole darn game.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.419
Is that the idol?

27:33.452 --> 27:34.186
You found it?

27:34.220 --> 27:35.421
Yeah.

27:35.454 --> 27:39.025
These four think they're so
smart, but it's like a bunch of

27:39.058 --> 27:41.527
blind mice just running around
bumping into stuff.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.595
Oh!

27:43.629 --> 27:44.630
Nobody saw that.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.431
Are you okay?

27:45.464 --> 27:46.766
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

27:46.799 --> 27:47.867
I just fell.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.569
I think they do underestimate
me, you know.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.471
And it's hilarious for me.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.141
But one of them's still going
home.

27:55.174 --> 28:00.012
I mean at this point I kind of
got my hand on everyone's fate.

28:00.046 --> 28:03.615
Tonight, it comes down to who I
can beat.

28:03.649 --> 28:04.851
And the challenge tomorrow.

28:04.884 --> 28:09.388
Ryan is safe because as far as
challenges go, that boy ain't

28:09.421 --> 28:09.722
done nothing.

28:09.756 --> 28:10.489
Cool!

28:10.522 --> 28:13.726
So it's between Mike and
Devon.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.161
We're set, dude!

28:15.194 --> 28:18.865
So physically, Devon is the
strongest competitor.

28:18.898 --> 28:23.936
But doc, he's good at challenges
and he's good at solving

28:23.970 --> 28:24.503
puzzles.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.304
Not fast, but he's good.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.406
So this decision is huge.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.674
I know you're bummed.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.508
I'm not bummed.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.076
You're not?

28:30.109 --> 28:32.511
No, dude.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.946
I'm going to have a meal
tonight.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.147
Yeah.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.149
I would have rather have
liked to make a million dollars

28:37.183 --> 28:37.716
but, whatever.

28:37.750 --> 28:38.584
It is what it is.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.187
I'm getting a weird feeling
from Ben.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.923
He's acting like he's givingip
in this game.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.525
But he wouldn't just give up
like that.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.693
Ben's a good player.

28:47.726 --> 28:48.961
He's dangerous.

28:48.995 --> 28:54.400
He may just be acting one way so
that we think he hasn't found a

28:54.433 --> 28:54.867
hidden immunity idol.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.268
It's terrifying.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.470
Do you know whose name he's
writing down?

28:58.504 --> 29:00.472
No.

29:00.506 --> 29:01.740
I'm voting Ben.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.409
Yeah, I know, I know.

29:03.442 --> 29:07.746
So you're certain he doesn't
have an idol.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.850
Because I'm thinking of putting
doc's name down tonight just in

29:10.883 --> 29:11.150
case.

29:11.183 --> 29:11.583
Why?

29:11.617 --> 29:12.351
I don't know.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.752
I mean, I followed him all
day.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.621
Yeah, but it couldn't hurt,
right?

29:15.654 --> 29:17.623
I don't think you should do
that.

29:17.656 --> 29:18.925
Just, you know...
pis him off?

29:18.958 --> 29:20.827
Yeah, you know.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.495
I'm going to see how tribal
goes tonight.

29:23.529 --> 29:24.296
Uh-huh.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.098
As long as you're certain...
okay.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.033
All right.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.301
I want to believe that there's
no more idols.

29:29.335 --> 29:33.105
I mean, for Ben to find another
one would be crazy, but maybe if

29:33.139 --> 29:35.741
I vote Mike, it's kind of
provide meeg with a little

29:35.774 --> 29:36.909
safety net.

29:36.943 --> 29:40.479
The super bowl, Mike will be
pissed off at me, and wouldn't

29:40.512 --> 29:42.448
take me in the final three.

29:42.481 --> 29:46.018
And, you know, this is our real
shot where we actually feel

29:46.052 --> 29:47.820
like, finally, we're getting rid
of Ben.

29:47.854 --> 29:51.924
I just got to pray that Ben
doesn't pull off a miracle

29:51.958 --> 29:54.526
tonight.

29:54.560 --> 29:58.865
( Applause )
Jeff: So much game play

29:58.898 --> 29:59.465
happening.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.833
Chrissy's on fire.

30:00.867 --> 30:01.934
She's unbeatable.

30:01.968 --> 30:03.435
The four are gloating.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.504
They think they're sending Ben
home.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.373
But Ben knows that isn't
happening.

30:07.406 --> 30:11.410
But the question... the question
is Devon.

30:11.443 --> 30:12.979
He suspects something's off.

30:13.012 --> 30:15.681
He's considering voting for
Mike, but it's risky because if

30:15.714 --> 30:17.917
you're wrong, it can cost you.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.886
One bad decision in this game
haunt you forever.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.088
Stand up, you you guys.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.155
Where are you from?

30:23.189 --> 30:24.991
Originally from New York, but
we live here in L.A.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.259
Jeff: All right, so what do
you do in this case?

30:27.293 --> 30:30.596
If you're Devon and you've got a
weird sense but you're in an

30:30.629 --> 30:31.763
alliance with four?

30:31.797 --> 30:34.100
Your gut, you have twoog your
gut.

30:34.133 --> 30:37.836
I mean, if you're Devon, you
have to ensure you're in this

30:37.870 --> 30:38.938
game another day.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.640
So if you've got to put Mike's
name down, put it down.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.774
Jeff: All right, okay.

30:42.808 --> 30:46.212
See, and that's why this game
continues to entertain us.

30:46.245 --> 30:49.615
It's a strategy, and you can
play along at home because you

30:49.648 --> 30:53.452
have to be playing at a high
level, and if you're not the one

30:53.485 --> 30:55.854
making the move, somebody else
probably is.

30:55.888 --> 30:58.690
I total you, it's a battle to
the end "survivor" finale.

30:58.724 --> 31:00.592
We're just getting started!

31:21.813 --> 31:26.785
* *
Jeff: We'll now bring in

31:26.818 --> 31:27.453
Desi.

31:27.486 --> 31:28.955
Cole.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.156
Jp.

31:30.189 --> 31:31.323
Joe.

31:31.357 --> 31:32.324
Lauren.

31:32.358 --> 31:37.463
And Ashley, voted out at the
last tribal council.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.299
So I'm dying to know, last
tribal council, everything goes

31:40.332 --> 31:45.804
crazy, Ben plays another idol,
everybody turns on Ashley.

31:45.837 --> 31:49.141
You get back to camp, Ryan, what
happens?

31:49.175 --> 31:53.245
So, there's a lot of
confusion because, once again,

31:53.279 --> 31:56.482
nobody knew that Ben had the
immunity idol prior to tribal

31:56.515 --> 31:57.283
council.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.251
And it was another "survivor"
first.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.553
I don't think anybody has ever
played an idol before the votes

32:01.587 --> 32:03.222
have been cast.

32:03.255 --> 32:06.392
But, ultimately, we were happy
that we all made the final five

32:06.425 --> 32:09.295
because of the confusion that
was going on at that tribal.

32:09.328 --> 32:14.200
Jeff: Devon, is it fair to
say that the group has made Ben

32:14.233 --> 32:15.467
the common enemy?

32:15.501 --> 32:17.303
Yeah, it's very clear.

32:17.336 --> 32:21.740
He's thrown his moves out there,
kind of in-your-face moves.

32:21.773 --> 32:25.744
He's not one to stay behind the
curtains and make secret moves.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.213
He's just out here to play.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.982
Jeff: Chrissy, at the last
tribal, you were surprised that

32:30.016 --> 32:31.650
Ben had an idol.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.753
How does that happen when Ben is
the common enemy?

32:34.786 --> 32:37.889
Why is he left alone to find an
idol?

32:37.923 --> 32:40.759
As much as we try to baby sit
a person around camp, we just

32:40.792 --> 32:43.729
can't be with them 24 hours a
day.

32:43.762 --> 32:46.532
I mean, he's getting up in the
middle of the night and running

32:46.565 --> 32:47.766
around looking for idols.

32:47.799 --> 32:51.337
I mean, we're at day 37, and
we're all exhausted and running

32:51.370 --> 32:52.438
on fumes.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.207
And we're just hoping somebody
else will take that on.

32:55.241 --> 32:59.245
Jeff: Mike, does that feel
true to you, that maybe it is a

32:59.278 --> 33:02.081
combination of the four of you
thinking in similar ways, and

33:02.114 --> 33:05.417
then hoping somebody else is
actually doing the hard work?

33:05.451 --> 33:10.022
I think that I spent my fair
share of time with Ben or

33:10.056 --> 33:11.257
watching Ben.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.193
But at the same time, Ben has
been a great buffener this game,

33:14.226 --> 33:15.394
right?

33:15.427 --> 33:18.030
Like, every time Ben is still
here, there's a common enemy.

33:18.064 --> 33:21.700
Jeff: And, Chrissy, while
Mike was talking, you pulled

33:21.733 --> 33:22.834
something out.

33:22.868 --> 33:26.038
So, the immunity challenge
was the gift that keeps on

33:26.072 --> 33:26.905
giving.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.407
Not only...
I'll say it for you... not

33:28.440 --> 33:31.710
only do you win your third
individual immunity, which puts

33:31.743 --> 33:35.281
you within one of the record for
a woman in this game... four.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.082
Right, thank you.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.516
Jeff: You also win reward.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.185
I win reward.

33:39.218 --> 33:43.155
And I took Mike and Devon to a
feast back at camp.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.791
And while I was there, I found a
clue to the idol and went and

33:45.824 --> 33:47.025
dug it up.

33:47.059 --> 33:50.329
And I actually did end up sort
of doing what Ben did, which was

33:50.362 --> 33:52.164
playing the cards out in the
open.

33:52.198 --> 33:55.234
So the plan is just by the end
of the night, I'll give it to

33:55.267 --> 33:57.969
one of these guys since,
obviously, I don't need both.

33:58.003 --> 34:00.339
Jeff: So, Ben, how did
Chrissy deliver the news to you

34:00.372 --> 34:01.573
about the idol?

34:01.607 --> 34:04.243
I was going to go get some
water and look for an idol, and

34:04.276 --> 34:06.845
she said, "well, don't waste
your energy."

34:06.878 --> 34:09.514
And then she pulled it out and
showed it to me.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.751
And, yeah, it was pretee that
was a heartbreaker.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.053
Jeff: And did the vibe at
camp change after that?

34:15.087 --> 34:15.954
Yup.

34:15.987 --> 34:19.358
These guys are all pretty happy
about it.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.893
My chances of staying in the
game was either to win the

34:21.927 --> 34:23.995
immunity necklace or find the
idol.

34:24.029 --> 34:26.398
And Chrissy had quite the day
today.

34:26.431 --> 34:31.137
Jeff: Devon, how would you
describe it in terms of graceful

34:31.170 --> 34:32.138
or gloating?

34:32.170 --> 34:35.005
I don't think Chrissy was
gloating in any way.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.342
I think she was being more
graceful.

34:37.376 --> 34:40.045
It was 100% gloating, Jeff.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.781
She was on cloud nine with her
little necklace, and I think you

34:42.813 --> 34:45.117
said, "oh, it was a great day.

34:45.150 --> 34:48.487
It was a two-fereday," or
something like that.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.489
I might have said it was a
two-fereday.

34:51.523 --> 34:51.989
I'm proud of my day.

34:52.023 --> 34:53.391
I had a good day.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.561
Jeff: Ben, what's it feel
like to sit where you are right

34:55.594 --> 34:57.596
now and know that the end could
be tonight?

34:57.629 --> 34:58.864
It's pretty rough.

34:58.897 --> 35:02.934
I came out here to win a million
dollars for my wife and my kids.

35:02.968 --> 35:04.570
You know, it sucks.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.206
It sucks, flat out, Jeff.

35:07.239 --> 35:11.543
To see the dreams get ruin by
these four... and good on them.

35:11.577 --> 35:14.112
But it's a hard pill to swallow.

35:14.146 --> 35:17.416
Jeff: Ryan, when you hear
Ben say that, it's sort of the

35:17.449 --> 35:21.887
truth for everybody who gets
voted out is they, in essence,

35:21.920 --> 35:25.023
they are blaming everybody else
for killing their game.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.393
And, yet, that's the point of
the game.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.162
Ben really completely
destroyed the game.

35:30.196 --> 35:34.065
I had to completely readjust my
game and retool to get to the

35:34.099 --> 35:36.034
point where I am at today.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.035
I don't know.

35:37.068 --> 35:40.572
I don't like blindsiding or
voting anybody out.

35:40.606 --> 35:43.709
I love this game, but that is
not something I take joy in.

35:43.742 --> 35:47.513
But at the end of the day, us
four had the numbers, and it

35:47.546 --> 35:49.781
just so happened that he was on
the outside of them, and

35:49.815 --> 35:52.150
that's... that's the game.

35:52.184 --> 35:54.620
Jeff: Okay, it is time to
vote.

35:54.653 --> 36:01.660
Mike, you're up.

36:10.369 --> 36:20.412
Oh, man.

36:20.412 --> 36:27.152
Oh, man.

36:29.288 --> 36:37.829
Jeff: I'll go tally the
votes.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.866
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,

36:40.899 --> 36:42.801
tonight is the last time you can
do so.

36:42.834 --> 36:43.935
Does anybody want this?

36:43.969 --> 36:47.639
No.

36:47.673 --> 36:50.376
Okay.

36:50.409 --> 36:56.915
( Whistling )
( Explosion )

36:56.948 --> 37:00.552
Ben bomb!

37:00.586 --> 37:01.753
La-la-la!

37:01.787 --> 37:05.657
While you guys were sleeping,
what's that saying, "the early

37:05.691 --> 37:12.197
bird gets the worm?"
Oh, my gosh!

37:12.230 --> 37:13.699
Jeff:
Jeff.

37:13.732 --> 37:17.903
This guy is insane.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.005
Jeff: This is a hidden
immunity idol.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.441
Any votes cast for Ben will not
count.

37:22.474 --> 37:23.775
I'll read the votes.

37:23.809 --> 37:27.646
Since we're pulling fake
idols out, I might as well get

37:27.679 --> 37:29.648
mine out, too.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.483
Jeff: First vote, Ben.

37:31.517 --> 37:32.584
Does not count.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.686
Well played, Ben.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.123
Jeff: Ben, does not count.

37:38.156 --> 37:45.464
Ben, does not count.

37:45.497 --> 37:54.205
Dr. Mike, one vote Dr. Mike, one
vote left.

37:54.239 --> 37:54.473
Devon.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.040
Oh!

37:55.073 --> 37:56.041
Jeff: We have a tie.

37:56.074 --> 38:00.746
One vote Mike, one vote Devon.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.247
Did you write down my name?

38:02.280 --> 38:06.952
I did.

38:06.985 --> 38:07.853
Sorry, Mike.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.355
Jeff: So here's what's
going to happen.

38:09.388 --> 38:10.556
We're going to revote.

38:10.589 --> 38:13.892
We will only vote for Mike or
Devon, and Mike and Devon will

38:13.925 --> 38:15.260
not vote.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.196
Ben, you want to come grab the
urn?

38:18.229 --> 38:20.532
Now your faith is in those
two.

38:20.566 --> 38:31.577
Yeah, it is.

38:43.389 --> 38:51.630
Jeff: I'll go tally the
votes.

38:51.663 --> 38:56.301
I'll read the votes.

38:56.334 --> 39:05.010
First vote, Devon.

39:05.043 --> 39:05.944
Mike.

39:05.977 --> 39:10.816
One vote Mike, one vote Devon,
one vote left.

39:10.849 --> 39:14.720
14th person voted out and
the seventh member of our jury,

39:14.753 --> 39:15.421
Mike.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.222
You need to bring me your torch.

39:17.255 --> 39:24.930
Good game, guys.

39:24.963 --> 39:29.401
You lived your dream.

39:33.104 --> 39:37.643
Jeff: Mike, the twrieb has
spoken.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.845
Time for you to go.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.112
See you, doc.

39:41.146 --> 39:41.680
Love you.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.914
Good luck, everybody!

39:42.948 --> 39:44.149
We love you!

39:44.182 --> 39:49.287
Thanks, Mike.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.389
Jeff: Well,
congratulations.

39:51.423 --> 39:54.125
You have made it to the final
four.

39:54.159 --> 39:57.763
Tomorrow, you'll compete in your
final immunity challenge.

39:57.796 --> 40:01.767
And to give you something to
sleep on, there's a twist.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.601
Grab your torches.

40:02.634 --> 40:03.469
Head back to camp.

40:03.502 --> 40:04.770
Good night.

40:04.803 --> 40:08.840
I thought you were literally
going to give us something to

40:08.874 --> 40:13.344
sleep on.

40:13.378 --> 40:16.715
I think they felt like they
needed Devon more than they

40:16.748 --> 40:18.484
needed me in order to beat Ben.

40:18.517 --> 40:19.685
And get it.

40:19.718 --> 40:22.654
If I made it to the final three,
I would have won "survivor."

40:22.688 --> 40:25.824
But I made it 37 days in the
greatest game ever invented on

40:25.857 --> 40:30.095
the face of this earth.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.634
( Cheers and applause )
Jeff: He did it!

40:35.667 --> 40:40.572
It was a huge move, but that is
how you play "survivor."

40:40.606 --> 40:41.740
Devon had a bad feeling.

40:41.773 --> 40:46.612
He listened to his gut, and as a
result, Devon's still in,

40:46.645 --> 40:47.713
Dr. Mike isn't.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.047
Dr. Mike, come on out!

40:49.080 --> 40:54.686
( Cheers and applause )
Wow.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.022
Look at the love!

40:57.055 --> 40:59.324
How you doing?

40:59.357 --> 41:00.859
I'm good, Jeff.

41:00.892 --> 41:01.727
I'm good.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.061
Jeff: That's got to feel
pretty good.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.796
It's amazing, guys.

41:04.830 --> 41:05.531
It's amazing.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.231
Look at this.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.066
This is awesome!

41:08.099 --> 41:09.801
( Cheers and applause )
Jeff: All right, so, here's

41:09.835 --> 41:11.036
what I want to know.

41:11.069 --> 41:16.274
Given how tight you guys were,
when you saw that vote, were you

41:16.307 --> 41:19.978
shocked or did it go through
your mind that it could happen?

41:20.011 --> 41:22.213
These guys are all great
players.

41:22.247 --> 41:24.015
And I knew this could happen.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.651
But I was hoping it wouldn't.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.819
I was, like, holding my cards,
one more vote.

41:27.853 --> 41:28.954
I almost made it.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.289
Jeff: Did you debate doing
the same thing to Devon?

41:31.322 --> 41:32.524
Oh, I was planning to.

41:32.558 --> 41:35.493
I told... I told Ryan I was
voting for Devon tonight.

41:35.527 --> 41:38.296
And I just...
so that... okay, that's the

41:38.329 --> 41:39.497
difference right there.

41:39.531 --> 41:43.001
Devon has... we always say to
people before... before the game

41:43.034 --> 41:45.937
starts, "play as though you're
playing for the second time,"

41:45.971 --> 41:48.006
because you have to make big
moves.

41:48.039 --> 41:49.407
Devon made the big move pup
didn't.

41:49.440 --> 41:49.808
You're here.

41:49.841 --> 41:50.576
He's still in.

41:50.609 --> 41:52.778
Thanks, Jeff.

41:52.811 --> 41:53.612
Thanks.

41:53.645 --> 41:54.813
Should I throw the check in the
fire?

41:54.846 --> 41:57.482
Jeff: One other... one other
ye, just from a dream point of

41:57.515 --> 42:00.919
view, you talked about... your
wife even said it... it's the

42:00.952 --> 42:03.254
only selfish thing you've done
in your life.

42:03.288 --> 42:03.989
Did it fulfill?

42:04.022 --> 42:06.024
Why was this the dream?

42:06.057 --> 42:11.697
I mean, you're as a kid, you
grow up and you want to have a

42:11.730 --> 42:13.431
family and you want to have a
wife and kids and I got it, and

42:13.464 --> 42:14.432
it's amazing.

42:14.465 --> 42:17.135
But at the same time, I want to
win "survivor."

42:17.168 --> 42:18.870
I want to play "survivor."

42:18.904 --> 42:21.439
And it...
( Applause )

42:21.472 --> 42:23.308
I got so close!

42:23.341 --> 42:25.210
37 days!

42:25.243 --> 42:28.780
And this was the first vote that
I was, like, you know what, I

42:28.814 --> 42:31.449
got to look one more vote ahead,
set up my final three so I can

42:31.482 --> 42:34.452
win and then...
boom!

42:34.485 --> 42:35.787
We got a Ben bomb.

42:35.821 --> 42:39.257
Jeff: Just remember if
you're watching, say I'll do it

42:39.290 --> 42:40.058
next time.

42:40.091 --> 42:41.827
There is no next time on
"survivor."

42:41.860 --> 42:42.961
We're down to four.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.831
There are no more immunity
idols, but as you just heard,

42:45.864 --> 42:47.866
there is a twist, and it's a big
one.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.270
( Applause )

43:08.519 --> 43:10.722
* *
is and then there was four.

43:10.756 --> 43:12.758
We made the final four!

43:12.791 --> 43:18.029
Tribal councilful not what I
expected at all.

43:18.063 --> 43:20.999
Ben shocked everyone, pulled out
his third idol in a row.

43:21.032 --> 43:22.133
Insane.

43:22.167 --> 43:23.835
You know you're the only
person ever to write my name

43:23.869 --> 43:25.036
down in this game.

43:25.070 --> 43:27.105
Welcome to the club, then,
welcome to the club of having

43:27.138 --> 43:27.939
your name written down.

43:27.973 --> 43:28.807
Welcome, welcome.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.709
I'm just so stoked to be
here, guys.

43:30.742 --> 43:32.911
Me, too, man, me, too.

43:32.944 --> 43:37.215
If I didn't write down doc's
name, I would be out of the

43:37.248 --> 43:38.449
game.

43:38.483 --> 43:40.551
I just had this feeling Ben was
playing all of us, and I went

43:40.585 --> 43:42.854
with my gut, and doc went home
and I didn't.

43:42.888 --> 43:44.489
I'm still sitting here alive.

43:44.522 --> 43:47.859
So I potentially did make a
million-dollar move right there.

43:47.893 --> 43:52.463
"Survivor" encyclopedia.

43:52.497 --> 43:55.667
Has a survivor ever played three
idols in a row successfully?

43:55.701 --> 43:57.435
No, you were the first.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.137
You're ruining my game.

43:59.170 --> 44:01.106
Vote by vote.

44:01.139 --> 44:04.642
I'm so happy for you.

44:04.676 --> 44:07.679
( Laughter )
Triba>> tribal council was amazi

44:07.713 --> 44:09.480
but, you know, this is where it
gets tricky.

44:09.514 --> 44:12.984
I have no more Ben bombs to drop
in on tribal.

44:13.018 --> 44:15.553
There ain't no more idols in the
game.

44:15.586 --> 44:19.057
So the final immunity challenge
is by far the biggest moment of

44:19.090 --> 44:22.160
my life, and I have to win it
because ain't none of them going

44:22.193 --> 44:23.294
to take me to the end.

44:23.328 --> 44:26.698
The only way I'm getting to the
end is if I take myself.

44:26.732 --> 44:27.866
Damn you, Ben!

44:27.899 --> 44:30.235
I have to win!

44:30.268 --> 44:32.637
I have to win immunity
tomorrow.

44:32.670 --> 44:33.371
I have no protection now.

44:33.404 --> 44:35.206
I have no alliance.

44:35.240 --> 44:38.176
But I do have my wife and my
kid.

44:38.209 --> 44:41.646
That's what I'm thinking about,
and that's my driving force.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.181
So it's "go" time.

44:43.214 --> 44:45.216
I'm going to give it everything
I got.

44:45.250 --> 44:47.618
Y'all, I'm going to go get
water.

44:47.652 --> 44:48.253
Go ahead.

44:48.286 --> 44:49.320
Do you want to follow me?

44:49.354 --> 44:51.222
No, good thing we don't have
to do that anymore.

44:51.256 --> 44:52.457
I wonder what the twist is.

44:52.490 --> 44:54.960
The twist is we need to beat
Ben tomorrow, I feel like.

44:54.993 --> 44:59.597
The eenl way we have a shot
is if we beat him at immunity.

44:59.630 --> 45:00.431
Exactly.

45:00.465 --> 45:02.200
That's pretty much where
we're at.

45:02.233 --> 45:07.272
I can't get rid of Ben, and
it's driving me absolutely

45:07.305 --> 45:08.473
bananas.

45:08.506 --> 45:09.808
But the reality is, even though
I feel like can beat Ben, I

45:09.841 --> 45:11.877
don't want to bring him to the
final three.

45:11.910 --> 45:14.412
So as long as one of us wins
immunity, he will be voted out

45:14.445 --> 45:15.446
of the game.

45:15.480 --> 45:18.016
Then again, we don't know what
the twist is, right?

45:18.049 --> 45:20.718
So the twist could totally foil
those plans.

45:20.752 --> 45:22.453
I have no idea.

45:22.487 --> 45:25.723
I've come to decide that you
can't expect anything in

45:25.757 --> 45:28.059
"survivor" because no matter
what you expect, something else

45:28.093 --> 45:33.865
is going to happen.

45:47.112 --> 45:53.985
Jeff: Come on in, guys!

45:58.489 --> 45:59.624
All right.

45:59.657 --> 46:00.591
Final four.

46:00.625 --> 46:04.662
Shall we get to your final
immunity challenge?

46:04.695 --> 46:09.100
First things first, Chrissy, for
the third time, I have to take

46:09.134 --> 46:09.801
it back.

46:09.835 --> 46:18.676
I hope to see you again soon.

46:18.709 --> 46:22.580
Jeff: For the last time,
immunity is back up for grabs.

46:22.613 --> 46:26.551
For today's challenge, you're
going to stack letter blocks on

46:26.584 --> 46:30.221
a very wobbly platform.

46:30.255 --> 46:35.593
First person to spell "heroes,
healers, hustlers," wins

46:35.626 --> 46:40.031
immunity and with this necklace,
guarantees themselves a spot in

46:40.065 --> 46:43.234
that final tribal council, where
you will get a chance to plead

46:43.268 --> 46:48.439
your case to the jury about why
you deserve the title of "sole

46:48.473 --> 46:50.608
survivor" and the million-dollar
prize.

46:50.641 --> 46:54.946
Losers, tonight, somebody will
become the eighth and final

46:54.980 --> 46:56.114
member of our jury.

46:56.147 --> 47:01.186
And as I mentioned, last night
at tribal, there is a twist.

47:01.219 --> 47:08.393
The winner of today's challenge
also receives the final secret

47:08.426 --> 47:12.330
advantage of the game.

47:12.363 --> 47:13.965
Stakes don't get any bigger.

47:13.999 --> 47:25.343
We'll draw for spots, and we'll
get started.

47:25.376 --> 47:28.246
All right, here we go.

47:28.279 --> 47:29.480
Big stakes.

47:29.514 --> 47:32.850
Final immunity challenge.

47:32.884 --> 47:35.786
Survivors ready?

47:35.820 --> 47:39.657
Go!

47:39.690 --> 47:42.527
First it's home blocks can you
carry out?

47:42.560 --> 47:46.031
Then you have to unlock this
structure with your foot, and

47:46.064 --> 47:48.499
then it gets wobbly, and that's
where the work starts.

47:48.533 --> 47:52.904
You have to balance these
letters without them dropping.

47:52.938 --> 47:54.539
Ryan off to a fast start.

47:54.572 --> 47:56.507
Ben now working on two letters.

47:56.541 --> 47:58.910
Chrissy has letters quickly.

47:58.944 --> 47:59.710
Chrissy drops.

47:59.744 --> 48:00.912
She's got to go back.

48:00.946 --> 48:04.916
Once you drop, you've got to
lock your structure in, pick up

48:04.950 --> 48:07.218
your blocks, and go back and
start again.

48:07.252 --> 48:11.056
But any blocks that remain are
still good.

48:11.089 --> 48:15.726
Ryan locking out, locking out is
a big part of this challenge.

48:15.760 --> 48:19.697
When you lock your structure
back in, that is often where you

48:19.730 --> 48:20.698
drop blocks.

48:20.731 --> 48:22.300
Ryan now with the early lead.

48:22.333 --> 48:27.838
He's going to head back.

48:27.872 --> 48:28.906
And Devon drops.

48:28.940 --> 48:30.275
That's what I'm talking about.

48:30.308 --> 48:34.412
You have to be gentle when you
lock this back in.

48:34.445 --> 48:37.248
You've got adrenaline pumping
through your body, but you've

48:37.282 --> 48:39.317
got to remain calm.

48:39.350 --> 48:41.619
This is your final immunity
challenge.

48:41.652 --> 48:45.756
This is not going to be easy.

48:45.790 --> 48:47.725
Ryan now with the early lead.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.061
He's got "heroes" spelled.

48:50.095 --> 48:53.664
Devon is starting over.

48:53.698 --> 48:56.434
Chrissy still working on
"heroes."

48:56.467 --> 48:59.470
Ben now has his first word
spelled.

48:59.504 --> 49:07.412
Can he lock in with the touch
required that nothing will fall?

49:07.445 --> 49:08.379
And he does.

49:08.413 --> 49:10.648
Ben now heading back for more
letters.

49:10.681 --> 49:14.085
We are neck and neck right now
with Ryan and Ben.

49:14.119 --> 49:18.689
Ryan begins working on
"healers," the second word.

49:18.723 --> 49:21.059
Devon back on "heroes."

49:21.092 --> 49:21.959
Devon drops again.

49:21.993 --> 49:23.694
Chrissy drops.

49:23.728 --> 49:27.732
Chrissy struggling for the first
time in a long time in a

49:27.765 --> 49:28.499
challenge.

49:28.533 --> 49:29.800
Right now it is not looking
good.

49:29.834 --> 49:31.869
It is now Ben working on his
second word.

49:31.902 --> 49:36.274
Ben really taking his time, not
panicking at all.

49:36.307 --> 49:39.410
Ryan's got "healers" completed
now.

49:39.444 --> 49:42.313
Ryan is two-thirds of the way
there, and starts his way back.

49:42.347 --> 49:44.182
Ben right on his tail.

49:44.215 --> 49:47.818
Ryan at the critical point.

49:47.852 --> 49:49.854
And he drops three.

49:49.887 --> 49:51.456
Ryan has to go back.

49:51.489 --> 49:54.459
And that opens the door for Ben
now!

49:54.492 --> 49:57.395
He's now going to try to lock
in.

49:57.428 --> 49:59.897
It is now Ben in the lead.

49:59.930 --> 50:03.034
He has nobody even close to him.

50:03.068 --> 50:09.340
Immunity on the line, a line.

50:09.374 --> 50:12.643
A guaranteed spot in the final
three.

50:12.677 --> 50:15.513
This is all all-in move by Ben
right now.

50:15.546 --> 50:18.283
No secret, Ben has been the
target, trying to get him out,

50:18.316 --> 50:19.284
unable to do it.

50:19.317 --> 50:21.586
And here we are in the final
immunity challenge.

50:21.619 --> 50:28.059
Ben just a few letters away from
winning his way to the end.

50:28.093 --> 50:30.128
Ben places another letter.

50:30.161 --> 50:32.363
Ben has four letters left.

50:32.397 --> 50:36.901
If he's right, this would secure
Ben a spot in the final tribal

50:36.934 --> 50:37.535
council.

50:37.568 --> 50:38.936
Ben places his last letter.

50:38.969 --> 50:42.307
He's still got to get this
locked in and be right.

50:42.340 --> 50:45.576
Ben looking for that last touch.

50:45.610 --> 50:52.317
To lock in.

50:52.350 --> 50:57.722
Ben thinks he has it.

50:57.755 --> 51:00.591
Jeff: No, something is not
right!

51:00.625 --> 51:01.492
What's wrong?

51:01.526 --> 51:04.129
Ben's got to figure out what he
did wrong.

51:04.162 --> 51:05.663
The door is still open!

51:05.696 --> 51:07.932
Devon now picking up the pace!

51:07.965 --> 51:09.734
Ryan sees the opportunity.

51:09.767 --> 51:12.002
Chrissy not giving up.

51:12.036 --> 51:13.838
Now Ben is panicking.

51:13.871 --> 51:16.441
Racing to get back out there,
and he loses blocks.

51:16.474 --> 51:19.944
Ben loses almost everything!

51:19.977 --> 51:21.078
Disaster for Ben.

51:21.112 --> 51:25.250
He's got to head back and redo
all the work he just lost.

51:25.283 --> 51:32.457
Ryan now with a comfortable
lead, and he can now slow down.

51:32.490 --> 51:36.194
And Ryan haas lost nearly
everything.

51:36.227 --> 51:39.764
And Chrissy loses everything.

51:39.797 --> 51:40.798
And Devon drops.

51:40.831 --> 51:42.367
He's got to go back.

51:42.400 --> 51:42.900
Wow!

51:42.933 --> 51:44.735
What a turn of events.

51:44.769 --> 51:49.574
The door is Wyatt open again in
this challenge.

51:49.607 --> 51:52.377
Ben is back in the lead now.

51:52.410 --> 51:55.646
Ben quickly has put "heroes"
back together.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.748
He's now going to try to lock
in.

51:57.782 --> 52:03.020
And Ben once again moves too
fast and loses absolutely

52:03.053 --> 52:04.255
everything!

52:04.289 --> 52:07.192
The lesson in this challenge is
staring you in the face: You

52:07.225 --> 52:14.098
never give up because all it
takes is one person to drop one

52:14.131 --> 52:17.935
piece, and you're back in.

52:17.968 --> 52:22.106
This is what you want on day 38
in the final immunity challenge

52:22.139 --> 52:23.974
on "survivor."

52:24.008 --> 52:34.051
Oarve is still in this!

52:34.051 --> 52:40.124
Oarve is still in this!

52:40.157 --> 52:42.092
Jeff: Devon drops again.

52:42.126 --> 52:43.561
Ryan drops more.

52:43.594 --> 52:44.795
And more.

52:44.829 --> 52:48.032
Chrissy working on "hustlers."

52:48.065 --> 52:51.536
Ben closing the gab right now as
he finishes "healers."

52:51.569 --> 52:55.306
He's now trying to lock in
without dropping any blocks.

52:55.340 --> 52:59.344
Ben races back, and he's going
to grab all the blocks for his

52:59.377 --> 53:00.378
last word once again.

53:00.411 --> 53:03.581
Chrissy places another letter in
"hustlers."

53:03.614 --> 53:04.181
It's Chrissy in the lead.

53:04.215 --> 53:06.417
Ben right on her tail.

53:06.451 --> 53:10.855
All the letters he needs to win
this challenge in his arms if he

53:10.888 --> 53:18.028
can finally complete the
challenge.

53:18.062 --> 53:21.299
Ben places his first, Chrissy
places another block.

53:21.332 --> 53:25.069
Chrissy is four blocks away from
finishing this challenge, but

53:25.102 --> 53:29.974
the block blocks are a long ways
Ben has all of his with him.

53:30.007 --> 53:32.477
Which strategy will pay off
right now?

53:32.510 --> 53:34.211
Ben places another letter.

53:34.245 --> 53:36.314
Chrissy trying to get out there
quickly.

53:36.347 --> 53:40.017
She is within one challenge of
tying the record for the most

53:40.050 --> 53:44.822
ever for women on "survivor"
with four.

53:44.855 --> 53:47.958
Ben places the last letter in
"hustlers."

53:47.992 --> 53:51.596
But he has got to get back to
the start with all of the

53:51.629 --> 54:01.406
letters in place.

54:01.439 --> 54:03.541
And he cannot do it again!

54:03.574 --> 54:05.876
Ben cannot believe it.

54:05.910 --> 54:09.714
He has once again dropped almost
half of his stack, and now

54:09.747 --> 54:13.117
Chrissy is back in the lead.

54:13.150 --> 54:16.554
Ben has now got to lock in, race
back, and hope for a mistake

54:16.587 --> 54:21.659
from Chrissy right now.

54:21.692 --> 54:23.561
Chrissy has one letter left.

54:23.594 --> 54:26.096
Chrissy reaches out and places
her last block.

54:26.130 --> 54:29.834
Ben is not giving up.

54:29.867 --> 54:33.003
Chrissy just needs to lock in
without dropping anything.

54:33.037 --> 54:36.541
And she is guaranteed a spot at
the final tribal.

54:36.574 --> 54:39.544
Chrissy has it.

54:39.577 --> 54:40.645
Chrissy's back.

54:40.678 --> 54:44.715
Chrissy wins her fourth
individual immunity challenge!

54:44.749 --> 54:48.719
Guaranteed a spot in the final
three!

54:48.753 --> 54:51.456
An absolutely epic final
challenge.

54:51.489 --> 54:52.990
Good job, Chrissy.

54:53.023 --> 54:53.758
You're amazing.

54:53.791 --> 54:56.160
Well done.

54:56.193 --> 55:00.197
What a challenge.

55:34.264 --> 55:36.266
* *
Jeff: Chrissy, come on

55:37.267 --> 55:38.035
that's a big smile.

55:38.068 --> 55:38.803
Yup.

55:38.836 --> 55:40.337
I thought the first one was
good.

55:40.371 --> 55:41.472
Jeff: Fourth one even
better?

55:41.506 --> 55:44.341
The fourth one is even
better.

55:44.375 --> 55:47.812
Jeff: Chrissy, for the
fourth time individual immunity

55:47.845 --> 55:48.913
is yours.

55:48.946 --> 55:52.316
This necklace guarantees you a
spot at the final tribal

55:52.349 --> 55:53.317
council.

55:53.350 --> 55:53.684
There's one more thing that
comes with this win.

55:53.718 --> 55:54.819
I forgot!

55:54.852 --> 55:56.421
Jeff: The last secret in
the game.

55:56.454 --> 55:57.822
Only you will know it.

55:57.855 --> 56:05.963
As for the rest of you, after 38
days, tough "survivor" days,

56:05.996 --> 56:09.900
Ryan, Devon, Ben, somebody will
become the eighth and final

56:09.934 --> 56:11.569
member of our jury.

56:11.602 --> 56:14.104
The final immunity challenge
was awesome.

56:14.138 --> 56:15.806
I am in the final three.

56:15.840 --> 56:20.044
And tied the record for a woman
for the most individual immunity

56:20.077 --> 56:21.912
wins in a season.

56:21.946 --> 56:27.585
And the icing on the cake will
be Ben going home.

56:27.618 --> 56:28.719
( Cheers and applause ).

56:28.753 --> 56:32.590
Jeff: That was one of the
most dramatic challenges in

56:32.623 --> 56:33.858
"survivor" history.

56:33.891 --> 56:41.999
You had exhaustion, elation,
despair, the upside-down "u."

56:42.032 --> 56:43.400
And it was madness here.

56:43.434 --> 56:46.403
Roll back some of our audience
watching this.

56:46.437 --> 56:49.940
It is so fun to be here and
listening to these guys with

56:49.974 --> 56:54.479
every oooh, and aaah.

56:54.512 --> 56:57.047
The upside down u.N.

56:57.081 --> 56:59.049
And Chrissy setting a record.

56:59.083 --> 57:00.985
Chrissy is unbeatable right now.

57:01.018 --> 57:03.387
Stand up, what is your name?

57:03.420 --> 57:04.455
Maggie.

57:04.489 --> 57:06.724
Jeff: You look like you
have to be a Chrissy fan.

57:06.757 --> 57:08.959
Oh, yeah, she is unreal.

57:08.993 --> 57:10.495
Jeff: What do you say when
you...

57:10.528 --> 57:11.796
you... hi, how are you doing?

57:11.829 --> 57:13.097
I'm doing great.

57:13.130 --> 57:15.633
Jeff: I'm so glad yawr here
with your buff on, too.

57:15.666 --> 57:20.004
Think about this, applied for 16
years, oldest woman out there,

57:20.037 --> 57:23.841
only woman left, tied the record
for women with individual wins.

57:23.874 --> 57:27.978
What is Chrissy never giving up
on her dream say to you about

57:28.012 --> 57:29.213
your own life?

57:29.246 --> 57:32.449
Man, it just tells me that
it's never too late to just rock

57:32.483 --> 57:32.950
it!

57:32.983 --> 57:34.318
I mean, that woman!

57:34.351 --> 57:35.786
She's amazing!

57:35.820 --> 57:38.122
Jeff: Your mom's rocking
it.

57:38.155 --> 57:38.989
She's ready to rock it.

57:39.023 --> 57:41.191
And I gotta ask... pop up,
qliewrs name?

57:41.225 --> 57:43.360
I'm grant.

57:43.393 --> 57:44.929
Jeff: Because I was
watching you.

57:44.962 --> 57:45.863
Are you a Ben fan?

57:45.896 --> 57:46.531
Yes.

57:46.564 --> 57:50.200
Jeff: The upside down "u."

57:50.234 --> 57:52.637
It's going to haunt him forever,
that "u."

57:52.670 --> 57:55.573
Chrissy is in the final three,
and the question is who will

57:55.606 --> 57:56.240
join her?

57:56.273 --> 57:57.274
There are no more challenges.

57:57.307 --> 57:59.009
There are no more idols.

57:59.043 --> 58:01.512
But there is one twist left, and
chrissys that.

58:01.546 --> 58:04.615
The question is what is it?

58:04.649 --> 58:06.250
Find out.

58:06.283 --> 58:07.084
( Applause )

58:27.437 --> 58:29.406
* *
good game, you all.

58:29.439 --> 58:31.408
You kept us all on our toes
that whole time.

58:31.441 --> 58:33.210
How many times did you almost
have it?

58:33.243 --> 58:38.248
Three or four.

58:38.282 --> 58:41.418
Daggone, man, that one hurt.

58:41.451 --> 58:43.754
Everyone was in the lead at
one point.

58:43.788 --> 58:45.656
Yeah
like there was...

58:45.690 --> 58:49.627
that final immunity challenge
was a butt-kicker, man.

58:49.660 --> 58:51.028
I was so close so many times.

58:51.061 --> 58:55.700
I knew I had to win immunity to
stay in this game.

58:55.733 --> 59:01.205
And it just hurts that a silly
mistake is going to cost my

59:01.238 --> 59:04.208
dream and my family's dream.

59:04.241 --> 59:05.475
Good job, mischrissy.

59:05.509 --> 59:09.279
Thank you so much.

59:09.313 --> 59:12.917
A million dollars is at stake
today, my kid's college,

59:12.950 --> 59:13.483
retirement.

59:13.517 --> 59:15.753
I just let it slip away.

59:15.786 --> 59:19.256
And that... that hurt.

59:19.289 --> 59:25.596
That hurt.

59:25.630 --> 59:26.363
Crazy.

59:26.396 --> 59:29.499
I do feel for him as a
person.

59:29.533 --> 59:31.802
You can be a millionaire,
Chrissy.

59:31.836 --> 59:34.939
First of all, you could be a
millionaire, and Devon could be

59:34.972 --> 59:35.640
a millionaire.

59:35.673 --> 59:36.106
True.

59:36.140 --> 59:36.941
Right?

59:36.974 --> 59:46.984
I know one thing, Ben will
not be.

59:47.017 --> 59:50.888
I'm pretty much the only
target on the board at this

59:50.921 --> 59:52.022
point.

59:52.056 --> 59:55.159
But until Jeff snuffs my torch,
there might be options.

59:55.192 --> 59:59.263
Is there any way that I could
stay in this game and go to the

59:59.296 --> 01:00:00.130
end with you?

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:02.532
Um...
I'd love to sit next to you.

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:03.634
Yeah.

01:00:03.668 --> 01:00:05.102
And I respect if you don't
want to sit next to me.

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:10.074
Okay, so this is, actually,
how I will respond to you.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:15.913
And that is by saying I will go
into tribal tonight and hear you

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.682
out.

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:21.218
And you have my word on that.

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:24.188
Ben approached me to see if I
would consider taking him to the

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:25.355
final three.

01:00:25.389 --> 01:00:28.025
Now, I didn't want to say
absolutely not, because I didn't

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:29.393
want to shut him out.

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:33.363
So I told Ben, ", you know,
what, I'm willing to think about

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:34.164
it."

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:35.465
But there's no way that's
happening.

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:36.166
Ben needs to go.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.334
All right, you.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:40.304
But before I can think much
further about, that I need to

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:48.913
get away privately to read my
secret advantage.

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:51.281
Okay, secret advantage.

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:51.916
"Congratulations.

01:00:51.949 --> 01:00:56.887
You are in the final three.

01:00:56.921 --> 01:01:01.058
You have also won an advantage
in the form of information.

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:04.361
This is the last and perhaps
biggest secret of the game, and

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:07.331
you are the only one who knows.

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:12.269
Tonight, you are in charge and
will cast the only vote.

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:18.108
You will choose one person-to-to
sit... " uuuh!

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:20.444
"You will choose one person to
sit next to you at the final

01:01:20.477 --> 01:01:25.082
tribal council forcing the two
remaining players to around

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:29.019
their way to the end by battling
it out in a fire-making

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:29.787
challenge.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.555
The winner secures the final
seat.

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:36.560
The loser becomes the eighth
member of the jury.

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:37.728
Jury."

01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:40.364
This is a huge twist in the
game, and it means the door is

01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:42.566
open for Ben to potentially come
to the final three.

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:43.801
Not good.

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:46.670
But right now, I have the power
because I am the only one who

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:49.106
knows about the fire-making
challenge.

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:52.209
So my decision is simply based
on who can beat Ben.

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:54.945
I've got Ryan and I've got
Devon.

01:01:54.979 --> 01:01:56.480
Ryan probably never made a fire
in his life.

01:01:56.513 --> 01:02:01.886
So the only way to send Ben home
is to have him make fire against

01:02:01.919 --> 01:02:03.053
Devon.

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:06.223
Now, I need to tell Devon so
that he has time to practice.

01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:08.893
Like, whatever he needs to do to
get ready for this challenge, I

01:02:08.926 --> 01:02:14.231
want Devon to do.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:17.701
"And you'll choose the person to
sit next to you."

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:18.936
Wow.

01:02:18.969 --> 01:02:22.172
If I pick you to sit next to
me, then Ryan has to make fire

01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:23.073
with Ben.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:25.009
If I pick Ryan, you will need to
make fire.

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:26.310
So it's up to me.

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:27.344
It was shocking to me.

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:28.645
I didn't expect this twist.

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.815
Immediately, I know she's
showing me this because she

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:34.384
thinks I'm the only one who can
beat Ben.

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:35.552
I'm excited, man.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.787
I'm pumped.

01:02:36.821 --> 01:02:40.791
It's going to give me that exact
umph at the end of my game to

01:02:40.825 --> 01:02:43.193
show the jury they deserve the
million dollars, that I'm one

01:02:43.227 --> 01:02:44.594
who took down Ben.

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:48.465
I don't want Ben to know he
has a chance.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:49.199
This is your day.

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:53.103
Okay, I can do this.

01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:58.642
How fun is this twist going
to be, o a scale of 1-10,

01:02:58.675 --> 01:02:58.909
Chrissy?

01:02:58.943 --> 01:02:59.309
0.

01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:00.344
What is it?

01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:03.247
Devon and Ben are going to
have a fire-making?

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.114
Why?

01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:07.784
She brings one person with
her.

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:08.886
She's bringing you.

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:10.254
Oh, my god, thank you.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:13.891
The other two must battle it
out and make fire.

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:17.061
The only way to get Ben out is
for Devon to make fire and beat

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:17.627
him.

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:18.062
I couldn't beat him.

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:18.795
I know.

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:20.564
Oh, my gosh!

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:23.233
Devon's going to have to make
fire against Ben and Chrissy

01:03:23.267 --> 01:03:25.970
says that "you're going with me
to the final three."

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:27.637
I am floored.

01:03:27.671 --> 01:03:33.210
Who knew that my inability to
make fire would save me on day

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:33.777
38.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.045
Ineic.

01:03:35.079 --> 01:03:39.416
He will be the one person who
can finally get him out of this

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:40.217
game.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.585
Go get flint right now and
practice.

01:03:41.618 --> 01:03:45.355
Throughout this game, I have
been able to start fire with

01:03:45.389 --> 01:03:46.490
flint.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:56.566
I've done it plenty of mornings,
but I need to practice.

01:03:56.566 --> 01:04:06.476
I've done it plenty of mornings,
but I need to practice.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.714
So I'm strike the flint, and
all of a sudden, it breakses.

01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:13.183
I'm thinking this probably meant
to be.

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:16.386
This flint just broke because
I'm not supposed to waste my

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.587
energy.

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:20.524
I need to go into this tribal
council calm, cool, and I need

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:23.760
to believe in myself because I
doment the million dollars for

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:28.532
my life, for my family's life,
for everyone I care about.

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:30.467
Tonight could change the rest of
my life.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.535
It all lies on me.

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:35.940
It's crazy.

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:39.176
Ben has no idea that he will
be going to a fire-making

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.078
challenge tonight.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:45.149
This game's in Devon's hands,
and I'm hopeful that he can do

01:04:45.182 --> 01:04:45.682
it.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:46.516
But I am very nervous.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:48.652
Either one of those guys could
win it.

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:52.522
So once again, it is going to be
a very interesting tribal

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:59.463
tonight, and we will not have
answers until the bitter end.

01:04:59.496 --> 01:05:02.766
( Applause )
Jeff: A brand-new twist

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:09.239
sets up the biggest showdown of
the season, quite possibly a

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:11.308
million-dollar fire-making
challenge between two very

01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:12.876
popular guys, Devon and Ben.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:17.047
But Chrissy, so smart, only told
her alliance so Ben has no idea

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:19.049
he's going to get another shot.

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.284
He's got no time to prepare.

01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:22.152
He thinks it's game over.

01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:25.222
Which is why we say all the time
on the show you never give up.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.356
Never give up!

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:29.659
Because you never know what is
coming around the corner.

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:31.695
We are live in Los Angeles!

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:54.851
* *
Jeff: We'll now bring in

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:59.756
the members of our jury.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.025
Desi.

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:02.026
Cole.

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:03.527
Jp.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.295
Joe.

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:06.463
Lauren.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:07.431
Ashley.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:14.638
Dr. Mike voted out at the last
tribal council.

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:19.876
All right, so let's start with
today's immunity challenge.

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:23.313
Chrissy, you win your fourth
individual immunity, tying the

01:06:23.347 --> 01:06:27.251
record for the most individual
immunity wins by a woman.

01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:28.718
Nicely done.

01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:30.354
So what's the feeling?

01:06:30.387 --> 01:06:34.458
When you just take in that
moment, knowing you have secured

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:37.027
yourself a spot at the final
tribal?

01:06:37.061 --> 01:06:40.397
For me, the fourth win was
incredible knowing I was going

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:41.398
to the final three.

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:43.800
And that was a super-hard
challenge.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.270
So it was just a great feeling
all around.

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:49.273
Jeff: Ryan, it was one of
the most electric challenges

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:51.007
we've ever had.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.076
And you had the early lead.

01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:53.243
Yeah, I did.

01:06:53.277 --> 01:06:57.147
You know, I'm a huge fan, and
wearinwearing that necklace,

01:06:57.181 --> 01:07:00.184
especially on day 38, is
something that you dream about.

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:03.453
It was tough, and I may replay
that challenge for a long time.

01:07:03.487 --> 01:07:07.424
Jeff: Ben, you had more
shots on goal than anybody.

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:10.327
And you could not close the
deal.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:15.799
An upside down "u" will
forever haunt me, because that

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:18.202
was a million-dollar mistake
right there.

01:07:18.235 --> 01:07:21.171
You know, I know I'm on the
bottom.

01:07:21.205 --> 01:07:22.406
It's clear and evident.

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:26.476
So I hate to say it is what it
is, but if I get snuffed

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:29.313
tonight, I did my best, and I'm
proud of my game.

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:31.281
And I wouldn't change a thing.

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:35.185
Jeff: Chrissy, along with
winning today's immunity

01:07:35.219 --> 01:07:39.089
challenge, you also won the last
secret advantage in the game.

01:07:39.123 --> 01:07:43.127
Did you keep it a secret or did
you share it with anybody?

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.129
I did share it.

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:47.664
But not with everyone.

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:49.599
Jeff: Ben, you're looking
around now.

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:52.369
Yeah, I'm wondering who she
shared it with, because it

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:52.969
wasn't me.

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:54.304
She shared it with me.

01:07:54.338 --> 01:07:55.305
Same.

01:07:55.339 --> 01:07:56.773
That makes sense, though.

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:59.276
I mean, I get that.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:01.378
I'm just wondering what it is
now.

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:04.281
Jeff: Chrissy, do you want
to catch the jury up and Ben on

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:05.615
what it says?

01:08:05.649 --> 01:08:06.850
Sure.

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:09.686
"Congratulations, you have
won an advantage in the form of

01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:10.887
information.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.058
Tonight, you will choose one
person to sit next to you at the

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:19.062
final tribal council, forcing
the two remaining players to

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:25.033
earn their way to the end by
battling it out in a fire-making

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:28.305
challenge."

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:29.606
Wow.

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:32.908
Jeff: So, Chrissy, I'm
guessing you thought a lot this

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.412
afternoon, given that you shared
it with Ryan and Devon.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.381
Well, let me say one thing
first.

01:08:38.415 --> 01:08:41.050
For some of us to be in charge
of their own fate, I see the

01:08:41.084 --> 01:08:42.051
beauty in that.

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:45.622
That said, I hope that it ends
in a certain way.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:49.125
Jeff: All right, Chrissy,
you're going to choose one

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:53.529
person that you can guarantee is
sitting next to you, and you're

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.932
simultaneously leaving the other
two to fend for themselves.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.901
That third spot will be earned.

01:08:57.934 --> 01:08:59.868
It won't be just given.

01:08:59.903 --> 01:09:00.670
Have you made a decision?

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:01.738
I have.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:06.475
Jeff: All right, let us
know what you were doing.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:13.750
I would like to take Ryan to
the final three.

01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:16.420
Jeff: All right, so, Ryan,
first of all, how does that feel

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:17.621
to hear that?

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:20.557
It's just a really good
feeling.

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:21.524
I thank Chrissy.

01:09:21.558 --> 01:09:23.593
We've been in lockstep a lot of
way here.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:26.430
And I get a chance to plead my
case to the jury.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:27.663
It feels incredible.

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:30.166
Jeff: Devon, how does that
make you feel that you will have

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.336
to earn your way to the final
three.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.938
I love the feeling.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:39.509
This is my chance to put my fate
in my own hands.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:40.544
It feels great.

01:09:40.577 --> 01:09:43.813
Jeff: And, Ben, your knee
is literally bouncing.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.515
This is awesome.

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:47.551
You know, I blew it today.

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:50.520
And that's all me.

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:51.921
But I get a second chance.

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:54.458
Jeff: Literally, a last
gasp.

01:09:54.491 --> 01:09:56.826
I'm ready to go make some
fire.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:00.430
And I'm going to do my best, and
we're going to compete, two

01:10:00.464 --> 01:10:02.532
warriors battling it out trying
to make a fire.

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:04.401
May the boast man win.

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:07.170
Jeff: All right, so here's
how it's going to work.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:10.006
38 days in, you should know how
to make fire.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:14.411
And if you can, it could be
worth a million dollars.

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:17.447
I'll give you a minute to think

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:18.515
started.

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:29.759
Jeff: All right, there is
one seat left at the final

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:30.860
three.

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:33.497
It's time to find out whose butt
will be sitting in it.

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:37.534
Ben and Devon, take your spots
at the fire-making station.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:40.404
We have chrisy and Ryan already
in the final three.

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:44.408
First time ever the final spot
will be earned by a fire-making

01:10:44.441 --> 01:10:45.241
showdown.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:47.877
You each have the exact same
supplies.

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:51.214
Your job is to build a fire that
is high enough and hot enough to

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.716
burn through that cord.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:55.952
First person that burns through
their cord, that flag raises,

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:58.555
you are sitting at the final
three.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:01.591
Loser becomes the eighth and
final member of the jury, and

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:03.993
you will be sitting over there.

01:11:04.027 --> 01:11:05.161
You guys both ready?

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:06.262
Yes, sir.

01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:07.130
Jeff: Good luck.

01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:09.999
This challenge is on.

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:16.906
This could go very fast.

01:11:21.445 --> 01:11:24.080
Jeff: This is not like
making fire back at camp where

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.550
there is not a lot of pressure.

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:31.054
This is potentially a
million-dollar challenge.

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:34.358
Side by side, both guys with the
same process.

01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:40.296
Devon going to go for it first,
trying to get a spark, trying to

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:42.899
get that magnesium to go.

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:49.038
Ben going to join him, both
sparking their flint.

01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:54.143
Ben has a little something but
it goes out.

01:11:54.177 --> 01:11:59.248
Devon now scraping more
magnesium.

01:11:59.282 --> 01:12:02.085
Ben look for a spark to get
something to light.

01:12:02.118 --> 01:12:05.955
Devon taking a more methodical
approach with magnesium, trying

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:12.328
to build a little pile of it,
hoping that will ignite.

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:13.162
Devon spark big.

01:12:13.196 --> 01:12:15.899
Trying to get it going.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:22.171
Devon's got one.

01:12:22.205 --> 01:12:27.911
Jeff: Devon's got a little
something, but it goes out.

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:32.916
Ben continues to strike the
knife, and he's got a little

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:34.651
something going.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.352
Can he keep it going?

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:42.191
Benben has the first flame, but
that's going to go out quickly.

01:12:42.225 --> 01:12:46.630
Hey he's to get sticks on it and
get something to take.

01:12:46.663 --> 01:12:49.766
Ben has more flame, has some
sticks on there.

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:51.535
Can he keep it going?

01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:53.570
Devon striking faster now.

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:57.674
Working hard trying to get
something going.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:01.711
Fire starting to burn for Ben.

01:13:01.745 --> 01:13:03.346
Devon, you're still in it.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.515
Jeff: Reactions from chrisy
and Ryan now.

01:13:05.549 --> 01:13:09.085
Everybody's been very open about
what they want to have happen.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:11.921
Ben is the only one who wants
Ben to win.

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:17.260
Everybody else pulling for
Devon.

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:20.063
Ben now pulling out the bigger
pieces.

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:27.303
And that's going to help lock
that fire in.

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:28.838
Devon continue to strike.

01:13:28.872 --> 01:13:34.177
Faster and faster, trying to get
something going.

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:37.814
Ben's flame is burning high now,
and it's starting to hit that

01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:38.448
cord.

01:13:38.482 --> 01:13:42.886
Ben is very close right now.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:44.320
Ben getting closer.

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:47.290
That flame getting taller and
burning hotter now.

01:13:47.323 --> 01:13:52.328
Will it be enough?

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:53.630
Yes!

01:13:53.663 --> 01:13:59.869
Ben wins the fire showdown and
earns the final seat at tribal

01:13:59.903 --> 01:14:02.572
council in a dramatic win
against Devon.

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:13.016
Good luck to you.

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:20.790
Jeff: Devon, sadly for you,
this is the end.

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:23.226
38 days on "survivor" is as far
as you will go.

01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:33.970
You need to bring me your torch.

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:35.171
Jeff.

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:38.474
Jeff: Devon, you become the
eighth and final member of our

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:39.008
jury.

01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:42.579
The tribe has spoken.

01:14:42.612 --> 01:14:48.151
Time for you to go.

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:56.860
Good job, Dev.

01:14:56.893 --> 01:14:58.862
Jeff: Well,
congratulations.

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:00.463
You have made it to the final
three.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.899
Chrissy, Ben, Ryan.

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:07.737
Tomorrow, the power in the game
shifts to the jury.

01:15:07.771 --> 01:15:12.141
Eight people that you had a hand
in voting out of the game will

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:15.645
now decide which one of you they
think is most deserving of the

01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:19.415
title of "sole survivor" and the
million dollars that goes with

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:20.183
it.

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:21.651
You have one more night out
here.

01:15:21.685 --> 01:15:24.888
I hope you get some good sleep
because are you going to need it

01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:25.922
tomorrow.

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:27.456
Grab your torches, head back to
camp, good night.

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:30.393
Oh, man, it's a bummer to go
home at this point.

01:15:30.426 --> 01:15:32.962
One day short, making final
three.

01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:34.463
But, congrats to Ben.

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:36.499
He killed it in that fire
challenge.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:39.435
Even though I lost, at least my
fate lied in my hands, and I

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:40.637
went out with a big bang.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:44.040
No matter what happens to me,
I'm a stronger man, and I just

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:46.976
feel blessed to have had this
experience.

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:52.281
I'm walking away from here
happy.

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:55.451
( Cheers and applause ).

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:57.353
Jeff: You gotta love Devon.

01:15:57.386 --> 01:16:01.791
Not many people would look at a
fire-making showdown as an

01:16:01.825 --> 01:16:02.826
opportunity.

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:06.429
He's one of the most popular
players of the season.

01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:08.031
Devon, come on out.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:15.471
( Cheers and applause )
Look at that.

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:18.642
Standing ovation.

01:16:18.675 --> 01:16:21.010
All right, have a seat, guys.

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:24.781
I don't know if we were on that
or not, but everybody stood up.

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:28.484
So, first, just what is that
like?

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:31.187
Because you're just this young
man.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.488
You come out to play this crazy
game.

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:36.159
When people come up to you, what
is it they say they're

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:37.093
connecting with, this love?

01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:41.064
I've got nothing but good
feedback, Jeff.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.165
It's beautiful.

01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:44.801
I feel so grateful to ♪ just to
have gotten this whole

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:46.535
experience and all the positive
love.

01:16:46.569 --> 01:16:48.772
Jeff: Is it moms, dads,
kids, everybody?

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:52.575
Yeah, the best is just when a
parent tells me about how their

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:54.711
kid loves me and looks up to me.

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:59.649
I just feel so honored to be a
positive role model.

01:16:59.683 --> 01:17:03.753
( Cheers and applause )
Jeff: It's really

01:17:03.787 --> 01:17:04.954
interesting.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:07.691
Mike was out here, and he said,
"I thought about voting for

01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:08.658
Devon, but I didn't."

01:17:08.692 --> 01:17:10.159
You did.

01:17:10.193 --> 01:17:11.327
So you're playing the game.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:15.331
And then when Chrissy, you know,
some would say dumped the

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.500
responsibility on you, because
she was in good shape.

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:19.602
She had earned her way to the
end.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:20.569
Now she needed you to help her.

01:17:20.603 --> 01:17:22.538
You didn't say, "wow, why does
Ryan get to go?"

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.007
You said, "I love it.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:28.144
It's an opportunity"
guys look at this as game play,

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:33.549
nothing else, just a game.

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:34.818
It is just a game.

01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:38.187
It's all fun, and to just be
able to get out there and play

01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:39.155
the game.

01:17:39.188 --> 01:17:42.591
I was already blessed just to
even be present.

01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:45.795
So... and to make it as far as I
did.

01:17:45.829 --> 01:17:48.364
Jeff: I watched Devon
backstage watching that

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:49.498
fire-making challenge.

01:17:49.532 --> 01:17:50.566
First time you've seen it.

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:53.737
And you were eye don't know if
you know, but you were

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:54.971
transfixed.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:56.940
What... just what is that feeling
when you're watching what you

01:17:56.973 --> 01:17:59.475
know happened, but you haven't
seen it?

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:01.911
Yeah, it brought me back,
definitely.

01:18:01.945 --> 01:18:04.080
It brought back all of the
emotion I was feeling and

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:04.748
everything.

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:05.915
And I'm super stoked for Ben.

01:18:05.949 --> 01:18:09.385
I mean, he deserved to be in the
final three.

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:10.353
He's the man.

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:12.789
Jeff: And that's why
everybody loves Devon.

01:18:12.822 --> 01:18:15.558
All right, and in case you're
wondering, that final four twist

01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:16.760
is not a one-off.

01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:18.161
That is a part of the show.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:21.197
So you can expect to see it
again next season.

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.066
Devon, the final member of the
jury.

01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:27.403
We have our final three...
Chrissy, Ryan, Ben, final tribal

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:30.306
council is next!

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:57.633
* *
there it is, day 39.

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:58.234
I'm going to the tree.

01:18:58.267 --> 01:18:59.803
Have fun.

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:00.636
Day 39.

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:01.805
Day 39.

01:19:01.838 --> 01:19:03.672
I'm marking the tree, dude.

01:19:03.706 --> 01:19:07.643
I'm sitting here on day 39 of
"survivor," as a super fan.

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:12.281
My dream potentially four votes
away from winning a million

01:19:12.315 --> 01:19:16.152
dollars and the title of "sole
survivor."

01:19:16.185 --> 01:19:18.654
It's really a dream come true.

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.723
I just got chills.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:21.925
We made it.

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:25.661
Strategically, it hasn't gone
exactly how I anticipated it

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:28.431
going, but I was with the game
every step along the way and had

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:32.701
to control my way to the end,
Luke a true hustler does, and I

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:33.970
think I did that.

01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:35.338
Last hustler standing.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:37.473
I think I'm the underdog going
into this tribal council, so I

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:41.077
need to persuade the jury I had
control of the game entire.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:42.711
Now, that's a complete lie.

01:19:42.745 --> 01:19:45.248
But I think if might work.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:46.015
Oh, my god!

01:19:46.049 --> 01:19:50.153
I see a clean frying pan,
eggs!

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:50.786
Oh, my god.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:53.189
Milk, sausages.

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:53.789
Champagne.

01:19:53.823 --> 01:19:55.191
Day one, I was terrified.

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:58.061
I threw up at the first immunity
challenge.

01:19:58.094 --> 01:19:58.862
That's how terrified I was.

01:19:58.895 --> 01:20:00.163
Final three.

01:20:00.196 --> 01:20:01.230
Final three.

01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:02.832
Final three.

01:20:02.866 --> 01:20:04.000
Cheers, you all.

01:20:04.033 --> 01:20:06.502
Who would know I would tie
the record for most immunity

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:08.872
challenges won by a woman in
"survivor" history.

01:20:08.905 --> 01:20:09.638
I killed it.

01:20:09.672 --> 01:20:10.339
It was a fun ride.

01:20:10.373 --> 01:20:12.375
It's a ride, for sure.

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:14.577
The ride is not over yet.

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:16.479
Of course, the game is not over
yet.

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:23.086
I have some fierce competition,
but I am a mom, so I'm an

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:23.819
everyday hero.

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:26.255
I think I deserve to win
tonight.

01:20:26.289 --> 01:20:28.691
I think I played a heroic game.

01:20:28.724 --> 01:20:32.261
And I want other moms to know
they should always dream in

01:20:32.295 --> 01:20:34.931
themselves and believe in their
dreams because eventually they

01:20:34.964 --> 01:20:36.132
may just come true.

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:42.805
Everybody happy?

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:45.341
You know, I've never let off
the gas.

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:50.413
I've been full throttle 100%
from day one.

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:54.050
This game and I are like two
peas in a pod.

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:57.720
Being in the marines, I've been
through a lot of battles in

01:20:57.753 --> 01:20:59.455
life, and tonight is going to be
a battle.

01:20:59.488 --> 01:21:01.490
Because Ryan is a good talker.

01:21:01.524 --> 01:21:04.127
And Chrissy won four immunity
challenges.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.497
I have to go in humble but
confident.

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:12.735
My game's been about providing
for my family more than

01:21:12.768 --> 01:21:15.704
anythinges, and at the end of
the day I need to bring a

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:17.840
paycheck home to my wife and my
two kids.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:21.144
I've never had a million-dollar
night.

01:21:21.177 --> 01:21:24.447
And I probably never will again.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:34.523
This is the biggest night of my
life.

01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:44.533
This is the biggest night of my
life.

01:21:54.477 --> 01:22:00.783
Jeff: We'll now bring in
the members of your jury.

01:22:00.816 --> 01:22:02.251
Desi.

01:22:02.285 --> 01:22:03.919
Cole.

01:22:03.953 --> 01:22:05.321
Jp.

01:22:05.354 --> 01:22:07.023
Joe.

01:22:07.056 --> 01:22:08.057
Lauren.

01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:09.425
Ashley.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:10.426
Mike.

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:16.399
And Devon, eighth and final
member of our jury.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:19.969
Welcome to the final tribal
council.

01:22:20.003 --> 01:22:21.204
Council.

01:22:21.237 --> 01:22:23.639
Chrissy, Ben, Ryan, tonight will
be your biggest battle because

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:27.043
tonight the power shifts to the
jury.

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:30.980
They will decide who deserves
the title of "sole survivor" and

01:22:31.014 --> 01:22:33.016
the million dollars that goes
along with it.

01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:36.252
Final tribal council is centered
around the three aspects of the

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:39.855
game: Outwit, outplay, outlast.

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:44.227
Outwit is the social part of the
game... your relationships,

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:47.863
alliances, relationships outside
of those alliances.

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:50.299
The outplay is how did you deal
with the conditions put on you

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:51.067
by the game?

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.636
You have to compete in
challenges.

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:55.938
There are switches and twists tw
and advantages.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.974
And the last and maybe the most
important part is outlast.

01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:04.113
Did you put on the jury people
who respect how you outwitted

01:23:04.147 --> 01:23:07.883
and outplayed more than the two
people sitting next to you.

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:12.888
I'm going to give you a minute
to gather your thoughts.

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.923
We'll get started.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:20.729
Jeff: All right, well, they
said it all.

01:23:20.763 --> 01:23:23.932
Now it comes down to the jury
votes.

01:23:23.966 --> 01:23:25.701
Oh, you have a buff on.

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:28.971
This is perfect.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:30.239
Ava.

01:23:30.273 --> 01:23:32.675
Jeff: That's my daughter's
name.

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:36.745
So, I have's question for you:
Do you know who you would vote

01:23:36.779 --> 01:23:37.146
for?

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:38.314
Jeff: Yes.

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:40.516
Okay, here's a piece of
"survivor... " real deal... here's

01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:41.750
a "survivor" pen.

01:23:41.784 --> 01:23:42.551
Don't show anybody.

01:23:42.585 --> 01:23:43.319
Use my back.

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:44.787
Write down the name.

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:46.455
Don't anybody say anything.

01:23:46.489 --> 01:23:49.825
And then we're going to see if
you agree with the majority of

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:53.462
the jury.

01:23:53.496 --> 01:23:53.962
Okay?

01:23:53.996 --> 01:23:56.999
Don't say anything.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.467
Fold it up.

01:23:58.501 --> 01:23:59.968
Okay, keep that.

01:24:00.002 --> 01:24:03.606
Next time I see you, I will have
the votes.

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:17.019
It's the "survivor" finale live
from Los Angeles.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:21.023
Jeff: Okay, Chrissy, Ben,
Ryan, let's get started with the

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.025
who wants to get us started.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:23.526
Desi.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:24.760
All right, great.

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:27.496
So, congratulations to all three
of you for being here in this

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:28.597
position.

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:32.034
Chrissy, hats off to you for
winning four individual

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:36.038
Ben, hats off to you for getting
idols and know continuing in the

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:37.240
game.

01:24:37.273 --> 01:24:39.608
But I have to say, Ryan, it
feels as if everybody felt they

01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:41.844
could beat you at the final
three and that's why you're

01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:44.780
sitting here tonight so I'd like
to give you the student to

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:47.483
convince us as to why you're
sitting here based upon your

01:24:47.516 --> 01:24:47.916
social game?

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:49.017
Sure.

01:24:49.051 --> 01:24:50.653
So everything in my game
emanated from the social game.

01:24:50.686 --> 01:24:53.256
I found the advantage on day one
on the boat.

01:24:53.289 --> 01:24:57.993
I used that advantage to build a
relationship with Chrissy and

01:24:58.026 --> 01:25:00.729
Devon and that was a social game
play on my part.

01:25:00.763 --> 01:25:03.532
Now, the seven, I feel like was
actually my idea.

01:25:03.566 --> 01:25:06.969
I conjured it because I had
strong inclinations and I had

01:25:07.002 --> 01:25:09.138
game moves based on the
advantage and the relationships

01:25:09.172 --> 01:25:12.040
that I could build with that
advantage to move forward in the

01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:15.110
game and form that seven going
into the merge with the numbers.

01:25:15.144 --> 01:25:17.880
So I had to depend on factors
that I'm good at.

01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:20.816
I had to depend on the social
relationships that I could build

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:21.584
with people.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:22.785
That was my strength in the
game.

01:25:22.818 --> 01:25:26.054
Then, I would like to know
why you may have felt that it

01:25:26.088 --> 01:25:30.993
was wise to then never have a
single strategic conversation

01:25:31.026 --> 01:25:32.261
with me?

01:25:32.295 --> 01:25:34.897
You know, that shows a fault in
your social game because you put

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:35.931
me on the jury.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:38.467
I don't have a strategic
relationship with you.

01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:40.636
The relationship would parlay
into the social relationship.

01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:45.441
But a lot of the conversation
that I had with you was filtered

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:46.309
through Devon.

01:25:46.342 --> 01:25:48.043
Devon, can you cosine on any
of this?

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:51.614
Yeah, uh...
I mean, this is a big deal.

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:56.319
Ryan's sitting in the hot seat,
and you might make or break what

01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:57.486
happens.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.256
Up until the alliance of
seven, Ryan's social play was

01:26:00.289 --> 01:26:01.457
used through me.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:04.126
There was a communication
with Ryan when I got blindsided

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:05.394
when you guys flipped?

01:26:05.428 --> 01:26:06.595
Ryan did not know about that.

01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:08.597
Yeah, that's another good
point.

01:26:08.631 --> 01:26:10.599
I did not know about the jp
vote.

01:26:10.633 --> 01:26:12.835
I did not know about the Joe
vote.

01:26:12.868 --> 01:26:15.704
Jp was one of my closest allies
at the time.

01:26:15.738 --> 01:26:19.508
I'm glad we started with the
outwit because, honestly, Ryan,

01:26:19.542 --> 01:26:23.679
I didn't realize you were the
puppet master when it came to

01:26:23.712 --> 01:26:24.247
Devon.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.180
You put him as a front.

01:26:25.214 --> 01:26:28.551
No one expected you, and Devon
got the heat.

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:31.086
I respect the play and I
appreciate it.

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:37.493
I feel like some of these
tribals people make pitches and

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:38.694
rah-rah-pitches to the jury.

01:26:38.727 --> 01:26:41.564
And king Ben...
I want to go with king Ben.

01:26:41.597 --> 01:26:43.666
Ben, your social gaisms
horrible.

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.734
You and I never comiewctd.

01:26:45.768 --> 01:26:48.003
The only conversation I recall
is you yelling at me.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:51.440
And Chrissy, you and our
relationship... boafgths you are

01:26:51.474 --> 01:26:52.508
fans.

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:56.245
You understood that at some
point we would be here.

01:26:56.279 --> 01:27:00.416
And you focused on challenges
and idols and chaos, and forgot

01:27:00.449 --> 01:27:07.690
one of the most important
aspects of "survivor."

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:09.958
You're right.

01:27:09.992 --> 01:27:12.060
This social aspect of it is all
new to me.

01:27:12.094 --> 01:27:15.063
There was a time when I couldn't
even sit at a Christmas dinner

01:27:15.097 --> 01:27:20.303
with my own family, let alone
sit on a beach with a bunch of

01:27:20.336 --> 01:27:21.604
strangers and play a social
game.

01:27:21.637 --> 01:27:24.507
I'm out here learning how to
interact with you guys and

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:29.512
strangers, not only as a game
play, but just trying to... just

01:27:29.545 --> 01:27:33.516
trying to better myself as... as
a friend and a man.

01:27:33.549 --> 01:27:34.350
You know?

01:27:34.383 --> 01:27:35.451
I can answer?

01:27:35.484 --> 01:27:36.685
Sure.

01:27:36.719 --> 01:27:39.322
Yeah, so I think that I just
had a totally different social

01:27:39.355 --> 01:27:43.392
game than neez guys who planned
many, many alliances and wanted

01:27:43.426 --> 01:27:45.193
to blindside this person, that
person.

01:27:45.227 --> 01:27:49.231
I got to the final three,
frankly, by being loyal to my

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:50.065
alliances.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:52.768
I stayed loyal to Ryan the
entire time.

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:53.769
I stayed loyal to jp.

01:27:53.802 --> 01:27:56.439
I had no idea he was going to be
blindsided.

01:27:56.472 --> 01:28:00.008
So my game was not to go out and
make a million different moves.

01:28:00.042 --> 01:28:02.378
As far as the other aspect of
social goes, I really did try

01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:06.615
and get to know each of you
individually, and I still could

01:28:06.649 --> 01:28:08.851
probably tell every single one
of you personal details about

01:28:08.884 --> 01:28:10.386
your life, like real things.

01:28:10.419 --> 01:28:11.920
Tell me my real thing.

01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:14.823
So what... okay, one of the
reasons you don't want to get

01:28:14.857 --> 01:28:17.192
married is because your parents
got divorced when you were

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:19.528
young, and that was horrible for
you, and you don't think that

01:28:19.562 --> 01:28:22.197
marriage works.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:24.867
Jeff: Cole, where do you
weigh in on the social part of

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:25.968
the game?

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:27.970
Right, so I want to focus on
Ben here for a minute.

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:31.139
I know I was a target of yours
based on some food issues that

01:28:31.173 --> 01:28:31.474
went down.

01:28:31.507 --> 01:28:32.708
Right.

01:28:32.741 --> 01:28:35.511
I'll go ahead and admit to
everyone that I did eat myself a

01:28:35.544 --> 01:28:36.879
little extra peanut butter.

01:28:36.912 --> 01:28:39.948
You managed to paint a picture
of me being a thief, and it put

01:28:39.982 --> 01:28:41.350
a huge target on my back.

01:28:41.384 --> 01:28:42.518
Right.

01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:44.920
However, if you can just
clear my name then I would be

01:28:44.953 --> 01:28:47.790
like, well, that was a brilliant
social strategic move.

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:51.860
Well, yes, I did paint you a
target because you were

01:28:51.894 --> 01:28:54.497
physically strong, killing it in
all the challenges, and if that

01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:57.733
was the only way I could get
people to turn on you, well, I'm

01:28:57.766 --> 01:28:59.034
going to use that.

01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:02.137
Nothing personal against you...
no, Cole, it went beyond just

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.706
painting a target on your back
about food.

01:29:03.739 --> 01:29:06.375
He had something, a vendetta
against you.

01:29:06.409 --> 01:29:07.109
No.

01:29:07.142 --> 01:29:09.177
Who really want respected
you?

01:29:09.211 --> 01:29:12.448
Who did you have the best
conversations with?

01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:15.851
Who didn't you get into an
argument with?

01:29:15.884 --> 01:29:16.552
Me.

01:29:16.585 --> 01:29:18.954
No, it was a strategic move.

01:29:18.987 --> 01:29:22.124
And you and I talked man to man
and I own that.

01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:25.728
I said I have to work on the
social game and sat on the beach

01:29:25.761 --> 01:29:28.631
with Lauren and Devon and told
stories I haven't told friends

01:29:28.664 --> 01:29:29.164
back home.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.133
I opened up with Mike.

01:29:31.166 --> 01:29:32.334
I told stories.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:32.835
That's real.

01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:33.969
This is my life.

01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:37.005
Ben, you're saying you told
people a lot of things but

01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:39.341
Chrissy genuinely reached out
and asked about people.

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:40.809
And that's huge socially.

01:29:40.843 --> 01:29:42.344
People want to talk about
themselves.

01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:45.113
She just spit out information
about Joe's childhood.

01:29:45.147 --> 01:29:47.583
I remember hearing her having
these conversations thinking

01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:48.984
this woman's a genius.

01:29:49.017 --> 01:29:50.185
Thank you, Ashley.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:53.822
And I think we know Mike and I
had a great social connection.

01:29:53.856 --> 01:29:57.192
Devon and I had a great social
connection.

01:29:57.225 --> 01:30:00.062
Cole, and you, you got a 34 on
your s.A.T.

01:30:00.095 --> 01:30:03.866
You can go about making
friendships with heme but it's

01:30:03.899 --> 01:30:08.370
how you use the friendships and
relationships you made during

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:10.372
the game and I don't know that
about you.

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:14.577
Getting to know people here
was part of my game play.

01:30:14.610 --> 01:30:18.647
Learning what made you tick to
see if I sort of agreed with

01:30:18.681 --> 01:30:20.148
your philosophy on how to win
this game.

01:30:20.182 --> 01:30:22.117
For example, Devon, when I got
to know Devon...

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:23.351
it was through me!

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:26.421
Ryan, just because your body
is present doesn't mean other

01:30:26.455 --> 01:30:31.126
people always have a
relationship through you.

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:33.128
But you didn't...
you're just making a lot of

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:35.030
I'm not making a lot of
statements.

01:30:35.063 --> 01:30:37.132
That we are now finding out
are not actually accurate.

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:40.636
So he is going to...
as far as this goes, the

01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:46.141
small he said/she said stuff is
not making an impact on the

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.275
decision.

01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:49.044
I want to say something on a
human level to each you.

01:30:49.077 --> 01:30:53.281
I am extremely proud of each and
every one of you all for making

01:30:53.315 --> 01:30:54.550
it this far.

01:30:54.583 --> 01:30:57.085
We still respect each and every
one of you and I want to remind

01:30:57.119 --> 01:30:59.755
you to take a step back and
realize this is just a game.

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:02.190
Outside and this game you can
still trust the people around

01:31:02.224 --> 01:31:03.325
you.

01:31:03.358 --> 01:31:07.530
I really appreciate you
saying that because it wasn't

01:31:07.563 --> 01:31:08.597
directed at just them.

01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:13.001
It was directed at all of us.

01:31:13.035 --> 01:31:16.071
I thank you for all that, but
we had a great day.

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:17.706
That's good.

01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:18.874
Let's move on.

01:31:18.907 --> 01:31:20.876
Jeff: We will move on to
the outplay part of the game.

01:31:20.909 --> 01:31:23.178
This is how you respond to the
conditions of the gameue have to

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:23.946
build a shelter.

01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:25.948
You have to compete in
challenges.

01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:30.753
There are twists, switches,
advantages, how you respond to

01:31:30.786 --> 01:31:33.522
those is now what they will
question you with b.

01:31:33.556 --> 01:31:35.558
Who wants to go first?

01:31:35.591 --> 01:31:36.759
Cole.

01:31:36.792 --> 01:31:40.295
As a wilderness guy myself,
the survival skills mean a lot

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:44.767
to me, building the shelter,
making a fire, and I respect the

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.402
hell out of Chrissy for winning
four challenges.

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:48.871
That's extremely impressive.

01:31:48.904 --> 01:31:52.240
Ben, you found all of your idols
and played them perfectly.

01:31:52.274 --> 01:31:55.911
Ryan, you haven't done much
around camp.

01:31:55.944 --> 01:31:58.681
There have not been a lot of
survival skills demonstrated.

01:31:58.714 --> 01:31:59.381
Just being honest with you.

01:31:59.414 --> 01:32:00.382
That's right.

01:32:00.415 --> 01:32:02.551
I can't argue any of those
points you just said.

01:32:02.585 --> 01:32:05.621
This was the first time I have
ever been camping in my entire

01:32:05.654 --> 01:32:09.692
life for me so I knew I could
not be a provider like jp could.

01:32:09.725 --> 01:32:13.195
I cannot crack a coconut like
everybody else can, I cannot

01:32:13.228 --> 01:32:14.229
cook like everybody else can.

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:17.532
I have not done any of these
things before.

01:32:17.566 --> 01:32:21.203
I did not want to step on any
toes if somebody thought they

01:32:21.236 --> 01:32:22.370
could do better.

01:32:22.404 --> 01:32:24.640
If I went in and burnedlet rice
where would that leave me.

01:32:24.673 --> 01:32:29.678
I had never tended a fire or
opened a coconut or used a

01:32:29.712 --> 01:32:33.148
machete or even seen a machete,
so for you to say, I didn't want

01:32:33.181 --> 01:32:38.420
to try that because it's not
what I'm accustomed to."

01:32:38.453 --> 01:32:40.689
You said, you didn't want to
mess up.

01:32:40.723 --> 01:32:42.858
None of us wanted to mess up,
either.

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:44.760
But I'm being honest.

01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:46.194
That's not my strength in the
game.

01:32:46.228 --> 01:32:47.930
You could have gone to get
the water...

01:32:47.963 --> 01:32:50.899
sat around and talked about
iced coffee...

01:32:50.933 --> 01:32:52.868
you literally hardly ever
went for water.

01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:57.005
Let's get to the idols and
the advantages because we know

01:32:57.039 --> 01:32:58.607
at camp life, we're not about
that life.

01:32:58.641 --> 01:32:59.407
Sure.

01:32:59.441 --> 01:33:00.876
Let's talk about the advantage
first.

01:33:00.909 --> 01:33:03.178
Day one, I found the advantage
on the boat.

01:33:03.211 --> 01:33:05.881
Then as we said before, I used
the advantage to progress to the

01:33:05.914 --> 01:33:07.082
end of the game.

01:33:07.115 --> 01:33:09.918
The story with the idol, which
was hidden underneath the flag

01:33:09.952 --> 01:33:11.053
back at camp.

01:33:11.086 --> 01:33:14.022
I dig up the idol, jp was there,
I shove it in my pants.

01:33:14.056 --> 01:33:18.994
Mass chaos enensues...
I had no idea Ryan had it.

01:33:19.027 --> 01:33:21.563
That's why she rode me and
jumped on my back.

01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:23.331
And I set up that entire
situation.

01:33:23.365 --> 01:33:25.834
That was well played because
it put a bigger target on my

01:33:25.868 --> 01:33:26.568
back at the end of it.

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:27.736
Right.

01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:31.707
And basically I had no choice
but to play it once you guys

01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:32.407
flushed it.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.642
That was the story of the idol.

01:33:33.676 --> 01:33:37.079
Would like to say I'm very
proud of every female that made

01:33:37.112 --> 01:33:40.615
it this far in the game on this
jury as well as Chrissy who blew

01:33:40.649 --> 01:33:42.017
us all away with winning four.

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:47.222
Desi, Lauren, Ashley, and I
took eight of the nine.

01:33:47.255 --> 01:33:49.692
I just want to give Chrissy
huge credit for that.

01:33:49.725 --> 01:33:50.693
Thank you.

01:33:50.726 --> 01:33:53.328
So I was terrified when the
challenges started.

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:56.131
I was not allowed to play sports
as a kid.

01:33:56.164 --> 01:33:59.101
I was told my whole life that I
suck at anything physical.

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:01.636
I threw up on the deck on the
first challenge.

01:34:01.670 --> 01:34:05.908
Because this was the one thing
that I was so scared of.

01:34:05.941 --> 01:34:07.976
Somehow, I found the courage to
just do this.

01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:13.048
And I'm really proud that there
have been 258 female contestants

01:34:13.081 --> 01:34:17.219
on "survivor," and there are now
only four that have won four

01:34:17.252 --> 01:34:18.954
individual immunities, and I am
one of them.

01:34:18.987 --> 01:34:22.124
I also got two individual
rewards and the secret advantage

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:23.892
for the final tribal.

01:34:23.926 --> 01:34:26.028
You should be very proud of
yourself.

01:34:26.061 --> 01:34:27.562
I'm almost 50 years old.

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:30.866
You applied for 16 years and
are a proven fact that giving up

01:34:30.899 --> 01:34:33.168
is not an option in your book
and congratulations.

01:34:33.201 --> 01:34:33.902
Thank you, thank you so much.

01:34:33.936 --> 01:34:36.138
I mean, we have a queen.

01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:40.475
We have queen Chrissy, who won
four individual immunity

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:42.210
challenges and you continue
winning.

01:34:42.244 --> 01:34:44.612
And I respect that, because just
like Ben, your back was against

01:34:44.646 --> 01:34:46.114
the wall, and you had to win.

01:34:46.148 --> 01:34:47.349
And I love Ben.

01:34:47.382 --> 01:34:50.385
I love the way you played.

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:54.289
Last night it came down to the
fire and Devon went home.

01:34:54.322 --> 01:34:57.625
It took my 10 days to find two
idols.

01:34:57.659 --> 01:34:59.728
You found three in several days.

01:34:59.762 --> 01:35:03.398
Was it easy or did you put in
the work and the effort?

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:07.569
After the blindside against
Lauren I knew I was on my own.

01:35:07.602 --> 01:35:09.337
Had no alliance.

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:12.240
Nobody wanted to look at me or
be seen talking to me.

01:35:12.274 --> 01:35:15.377
I chose to get up in the morning
before everyone else and go

01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:16.444
look.

01:35:16.478 --> 01:35:18.480
I didn't sit around and watch
the sunset, you know.

01:35:18.513 --> 01:35:20.615
While they were sleeping, I was
looking for idols.

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:24.352
When I ran out of idols, her
secret advantage gave me life,

01:35:24.386 --> 01:35:26.154
and I took every opportunity and
never quit.

01:35:26.188 --> 01:35:28.556
The only one that was going to
save me was me.

01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:32.761
So, yes, I put in the time to
find the idols.

01:35:32.795 --> 01:35:34.729
So here's a better question.

01:35:34.763 --> 01:35:37.632
There is a point in the game
where there were four of you and

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:38.867
then there was Ben.

01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:41.904
How did you all allow Ben the
opportunity to go off on his own

01:35:41.937 --> 01:35:44.539
this many times to find that
many idols?

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:47.509
I was one step ahead on every
idol.

01:35:47.542 --> 01:35:51.046
These guys went looking at the
raft, but I already had it in my

01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:52.214
pocket.

01:35:52.247 --> 01:35:54.682
Mike was looking under the
shelter, I already had it in my

01:35:54.716 --> 01:35:55.884
pocket.

01:35:55.918 --> 01:35:59.454
Mike was looking at the rock
pit, I had already had int in my

01:35:59.487 --> 01:36:04.092
she played a fake idol and I
knew it was fake because I

01:36:04.126 --> 01:36:04.993
already had it in my pocket.

01:36:05.027 --> 01:36:10.232
We tried to trail him...
four people.

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:12.801
That was a game flaw for all
four of us.

01:36:12.835 --> 01:36:17.305
Jeff: It is time to move on
to the outlaf part of the game.

01:36:17.339 --> 01:36:18.807
This shifts back to you guys.

01:36:18.841 --> 01:36:22.477
Did you put the right people on
the jury?

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:26.849
Did they respect your outexpwit
outplay more than the other two?

01:36:26.882 --> 01:36:29.784
This is your last moment to make
sure the people you put over

01:36:29.818 --> 01:36:31.954
there are about to write your
name down.

01:36:31.987 --> 01:36:32.988
Ryan, you want to go first?

01:36:33.021 --> 01:36:36.358
Yes, so I could not rely on
winning challenges.

01:36:36.391 --> 01:36:38.793
I knew that going into the game,
so I had to build these social

01:36:38.827 --> 01:36:40.795
relationships to get me through
the early part of the game, and

01:36:40.829 --> 01:36:42.064
it worked.

01:36:42.097 --> 01:36:45.800
And I was at 13 out of 15 tribal
councils, and my name was never

01:36:45.834 --> 01:36:47.002
on the chopping block.

01:36:47.035 --> 01:36:49.504
And it was not because people
wanted to take me to the end.

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:52.340
It was because I built enough
social relationships and bonds

01:36:52.374 --> 01:36:55.377
with people that they wouldn't
let my name come up on the

01:36:55.410 --> 01:36:56.611
chopping block.

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:58.713
I think I had more deals to the
end than anybody else did, and

01:36:58.746 --> 01:37:00.415
that's a credit to my game.

01:37:00.448 --> 01:37:04.319
They're getting a lot of credit
for playing hard, I but I

01:37:04.352 --> 01:37:06.788
fortified the social bonds,
secured an idol, got an

01:37:06.821 --> 01:37:08.656
advantage, and I never gave up.

01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:09.992
That's why I'm sitting here.

01:37:10.025 --> 01:37:12.995
Nobody dragged me here.

01:37:13.028 --> 01:37:14.096
Nobody.

01:37:14.129 --> 01:37:16.331
And...
Ryan, I can disrupt for a

01:37:16.364 --> 01:37:16.631
second?

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:17.599
Yes.

01:37:17.632 --> 01:37:20.035
What you have learned in
playing this game?

01:37:20.068 --> 01:37:23.105
I learned a lot about myself.

01:37:23.138 --> 01:37:26.541
I got rejuvenated when my dad
came out here on day 31.

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:29.878
That was the best day of my life
honestly.

01:37:29.912 --> 01:37:32.414
This game say confluence of
constant emotions overlapping

01:37:32.447 --> 01:37:33.648
each other.

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:38.720
It's may me realize about myself
they value the simplicities of

01:37:38.753 --> 01:37:40.989
life, having people close to
you, having a family.

01:37:41.023 --> 01:37:44.326
You all know I'm a huge fan of
"survivor" and it's been a dream

01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:47.195
to play the game but I never
looked at myself intro

01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:52.834
spectively as this game has
compelled me to do.

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:53.668
Jeff: Ben.

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:55.603
Mine is going to be short and
sweet.

01:37:55.637 --> 01:37:58.506
Every single one of I had a hand
in putting there because you

01:37:58.540 --> 01:37:59.975
guys were hurdles.

01:38:00.008 --> 01:38:03.111
You guys were a hurdle to a
million dollars pup were a

01:38:03.145 --> 01:38:06.414
threat to me providing for my
family, and I respect you guys

01:38:06.448 --> 01:38:07.215
as threats.

01:38:07.249 --> 01:38:12.620
But I had to put you in those
seats.

01:38:12.654 --> 01:38:16.258
Ben, win or lose tonight, you
have played one of the best

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:17.559
games in "survivor" history.

01:38:17.592 --> 01:38:19.627
And you will be a legend in this
game.

01:38:19.661 --> 01:38:24.532
But I would like to you give us
not why you voted us out, but

01:38:24.566 --> 01:38:25.900
why you should be the winner
tonight?

01:38:25.934 --> 01:38:30.472
I have to pigg piggyback off
that.

01:38:30.505 --> 01:38:35.177
For someone who had his back
against the wall for so long.

01:38:35.210 --> 01:38:36.979
It's almost like you're giving
up.

01:38:37.012 --> 01:38:39.681
I know you're a fighter and I
know you have it in you, and I

01:38:39.714 --> 01:38:40.915
need more.

01:38:40.949 --> 01:38:44.419
Yes, sir, the reason I should
be the sole survivor this year

01:38:44.452 --> 01:38:47.555
because after being deemed a
king and deemed a dictator by

01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:51.326
her, I never quit looking and I
never quit battling against all

01:38:51.359 --> 01:38:52.127
of you all.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.061
I was not put here.

01:38:53.095 --> 01:38:54.296
I got myself here.

01:38:54.329 --> 01:38:58.266
And i... I told everyone I was
out here for my family, and I am

01:38:58.300 --> 01:38:59.467
out here for my family.

01:38:59.501 --> 01:39:02.270
And I talked about stuff that
happened in the military.

01:39:02.304 --> 01:39:05.240
I came back with p.T.S.D.

01:39:05.273 --> 01:39:09.411
A lot of combat vets do, and me
being out here now is a message

01:39:09.444 --> 01:39:13.315
to all those men and women who
are struggling that you don't

01:39:13.348 --> 01:39:14.749
have to feel alone.

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:18.920
You don't have to feel that
nobody understands.

01:39:18.953 --> 01:39:20.155
It's powerful.

01:39:20.188 --> 01:39:25.293
So if I can be labeled a hero
for showing all those vets that

01:39:25.327 --> 01:39:28.630
it can be done and there is
happiness, you're going to have

01:39:28.663 --> 01:39:31.633
to work hard for it.

01:39:31.666 --> 01:39:34.036
But, you know, it can be done.

01:39:34.069 --> 01:39:38.006
So...

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:39.241
Jeff: Chrissy.

01:39:39.274 --> 01:39:42.810
Okay, I came into this game
totally underestimating myself.

01:39:42.844 --> 01:39:45.313
And throughout the game, I
realized there are times I need

01:39:45.347 --> 01:39:47.715
to just say, "I'm awesome at
that."

01:39:47.749 --> 01:39:53.555
And in this case, I'm saying, I
kicked ass challenges.

01:39:53.588 --> 01:39:55.757
I kicked ass strategically.

01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:57.659
I think I truth made connections
with each of you.

01:39:57.692 --> 01:40:01.763
I got to the end playing a good,
clean, solid game without

01:40:01.796 --> 01:40:02.830
leaving a trail of destruction.

01:40:02.864 --> 01:40:04.532
I did an awesome job.

01:40:04.566 --> 01:40:09.537
But I want to say all moms are
heroes because they put other

01:40:09.571 --> 01:40:10.272
people before themselves.

01:40:10.305 --> 01:40:12.107
They don't even stop and think.

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:13.841
They put themselveses on the
line every day.

01:40:13.875 --> 01:40:16.211
Yes, not like a firefighter or a
marine.

01:40:16.244 --> 01:40:19.481
But it is with great love and no
thought that they get in there

01:40:19.514 --> 01:40:22.016
and do whatever they have to do
for their kids.

01:40:22.050 --> 01:40:25.487
And so, moms are not only
heroes.

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.923
But we are also healers, and we
are also hustlers.

01:40:28.956 --> 01:40:35.730
So in a way, my game and who I
am is all parts of that.

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:39.367
And let's not forget the fact
that I've been applying for 16

01:40:39.401 --> 01:40:40.368
years.

01:40:40.402 --> 01:40:42.304
The whole thing sunever give up
on your dreams.

01:40:42.337 --> 01:40:46.774
You be can be a 47-year-old mom
and freaking do this.

01:40:46.808 --> 01:40:49.477
Whoever wins this season is the
representative of all of us.

01:40:49.511 --> 01:40:53.181
And I think if you vote me as
the winner, you all can feel

01:40:53.215 --> 01:40:55.917
proud of me as the winner of
your season and something we can

01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:57.885
all really celebrate.

01:40:57.919 --> 01:41:02.757
Jeff: All right, very
healthy, candid, challenging

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:03.925
final tribal.

01:41:03.958 --> 01:41:06.894
Jury, I'm going to give you a
moment to take in everything

01:41:06.928 --> 01:41:08.930
that's been said, and then we
will vote.

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:24.112
Jeff: Okay, so 39 days of
"survivor" comes down to this

01:41:24.146 --> 01:41:25.347
one final vote.

01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:28.916
Jury, you are voting for either
Chrissy, Ben, or Ryan, whoever

01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:32.787
you think played the best game
and want to reward with the

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:36.124
title of "sole survivor" and a
million dollars.

01:41:36.158 --> 01:41:40.795
For the last time, it is time to
vote.

01:41:40.828 --> 01:41:46.334
Desi, you're up.

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:58.213
I hope you make something
better for a lot of veterans and

01:41:58.246 --> 01:42:02.650
make me proud.

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:16.431
Coming into the final tribal,
I didn't think there was any way

01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:20.902
you were going to pull it off,
but I'm always rooting for the

01:42:20.935 --> 01:42:22.804
underdog, and I hope you win
tonight.

01:42:22.837 --> 01:42:28.843
Good luck.

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:43.124
Although I have many reasons
not to vote for each of these

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:48.263
individuals, I believe this one
has proven to be the ultimate

01:42:48.296 --> 01:42:55.370
survivor that I'm okay
representing our season.

01:42:55.403 --> 01:43:06.448
Jeff: For the last time,
I'll go get the votes.

01:43:06.481 --> 01:43:09.951
Thank you all for another great
season of "survivor."

01:43:09.984 --> 01:43:13.255
And I will see you back in the
states for the reading of the

01:43:13.288 --> 01:43:16.258
votes.

01:43:41.283 --> 01:43:52.827
( Cheers and applause )
Jeff: Don't leave me

01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:53.194
hanging!

01:43:53.227 --> 01:43:53.928
Look at you!

01:43:53.961 --> 01:43:55.229
Look at you!

01:43:55.263 --> 01:43:55.897
Oh, my god!

01:43:55.930 --> 01:43:57.999
All the love!

01:43:58.032 --> 01:44:02.370
Cochran!

01:44:06.474 --> 01:44:07.275
Jeff: All right!

01:44:07.309 --> 01:44:09.777
Thank you, guys.

01:44:09.811 --> 01:44:11.012
What a fun night.

01:44:11.045 --> 01:44:12.947
The energy here has been
electric.

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.115
It's all because of you guys.

01:44:14.148 --> 01:44:18.052
Thank you, really, for another
great season of "survivor."

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:22.490
( Applause )
Starterred out a little cagey,

01:44:22.524 --> 01:44:25.026
you have to admit, a slow burn.

01:44:25.059 --> 01:44:30.332
And wasn't sure what would
happen, and the game play kicked

01:44:30.365 --> 01:44:31.566
in.

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:33.200
The greatest parent of the game
for me is when social politics

01:44:33.234 --> 01:44:37.305
comes full circle and the people
that are voted out now are in

01:44:37.339 --> 01:44:38.540
charge.

01:44:38.573 --> 01:44:40.375
And the question becomes, "did
you guys do the job you have to

01:44:40.408 --> 01:44:42.310
do," which is put the right
people on the jury.

01:44:42.344 --> 01:44:44.946
Let's talk about your games.

01:44:44.979 --> 01:44:45.279
Ryan.

01:44:45.313 --> 01:44:46.514
Super fan.

01:44:46.548 --> 01:44:49.751
Played with such heart that we
literally saw your heart beating

01:44:49.784 --> 01:44:51.853
through your tiny little chest.

01:44:51.886 --> 01:44:55.189
( Applause )
During the loved one visit, your

01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:59.026
dad came out, you were really
open about your bond and that

01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:01.796
"survivor" was a shared
experience between you two.

01:45:01.829 --> 01:45:04.832
Ben, your back has been up
against the wall for a long

01:45:04.866 --> 01:45:05.800
time.

01:45:05.833 --> 01:45:07.802
A lot of tribals, you never
stopped fighting.

01:45:07.835 --> 01:45:09.971
You were very clear about the
reason you were out there.

01:45:10.004 --> 01:45:12.039
We met your wife.

01:45:12.073 --> 01:45:15.343
You credit her with saving your
life, literally, and you are are

01:45:15.377 --> 01:45:16.578
playing for your kids.

01:45:16.611 --> 01:45:20.982
And you were also very open and
vulnerable about the fact that

01:45:21.015 --> 01:45:25.487
you wanted other vets who were
suffering from p.T.S.D. To see

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.721
that there is life after combat.

01:45:26.754 --> 01:45:28.923
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

01:45:28.956 --> 01:45:30.592
Jeff: Chrissy, completely
different story.

01:45:30.625 --> 01:45:32.527
A work mom.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:34.396
47 years old.

01:45:34.429 --> 01:45:36.498
Applied for 16 years to get out
here.

01:45:36.531 --> 01:45:40.635
You dominated, set records in
this game.

01:45:40.668 --> 01:45:44.639
When we saw your husband... your
husband came out at the loved

01:45:44.672 --> 01:45:47.241
one, and we saw a completely
different side of you.

01:45:47.274 --> 01:45:49.477
You said he's the greatest man
you've ever known.

01:45:49.511 --> 01:45:53.280
And you said, "it reminds me
when I get back home I want to

01:45:53.314 --> 01:45:55.182
put focus back on the family."

01:45:55.216 --> 01:45:57.985
Three completely different
reasons for playing, but all of

01:45:58.019 --> 01:45:59.153
them got you here.

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:02.089
And when you think about
survivor and you dream of

01:46:02.123 --> 01:46:03.057
playing, this is it.

01:46:03.090 --> 01:46:05.793
The essence is could I actually
last 39 days?

01:46:05.827 --> 01:46:09.263
Could I get to the final three
and get a chance to plead my

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:10.965
case they deserve it?

01:46:10.998 --> 01:46:11.866
Amazing accomplishment.

01:46:11.899 --> 01:46:13.435
Nobody can take that away from
you.

01:46:13.468 --> 01:46:15.703
But there can only be one
winner.

01:46:15.737 --> 01:46:17.472
It's why it's such a great game.

01:46:17.505 --> 01:46:21.443
These are the votes for the
winner of our 35th season of

01:46:21.476 --> 01:46:25.447
"survivor."

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.549
( Cheers and applause )
First vote.

01:46:31.453 --> 01:46:32.119
Ben.

01:46:32.153 --> 01:46:38.726
( Cheers and applause )
Ryan.

01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:45.633
( Cheers and applause )
One vote Ben, one vote Ryan.

01:46:45.667 --> 01:46:46.868
Chrissy.

01:46:46.901 --> 01:46:49.403
( Cheers and applause )
One vote Ben, one vote Ryan, one

01:46:49.437 --> 01:46:54.408
vote Chrissy.

01:46:54.442 --> 01:46:56.043
Chrissy.

01:46:56.077 --> 01:46:59.447
( Cheers and applause )
Two votes Chrissy, one vote Ben,

01:46:59.481 --> 01:47:04.218
one vote Ryan.

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:05.219
Ben.

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:07.188
( Cheers and applause )
We are tied again.

01:47:07.221 --> 01:47:15.863
Two votes Chrissy, two votes
Ben, one vote Ryan.

01:47:15.897 --> 01:47:17.031
Clen.

01:47:17.064 --> 01:47:18.800
( Cheers and applause )
That's three votes Ben, two

01:47:18.833 --> 01:47:23.270
votes Chrissy, one vote Ryan.

01:47:23.304 --> 01:47:24.806
One vote left.

01:47:24.839 --> 01:47:28.976
The winner of "survivor," Ben!

01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:35.416
( Cheers and applause )
Jeff: Well, it was a

01:47:39.854 --> 01:47:43.190
culmination of 39 days right
there, one of the most intense

01:47:43.224 --> 01:47:46.728
and drank experiences.

01:47:46.761 --> 01:47:50.498
Ben was on a mission, and while
others slept, he was out there

01:47:50.532 --> 01:47:52.466
making things happen, looking
for idols.

01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:55.036
He's the only one who could keep
a secret.

01:47:55.069 --> 01:47:56.504
Let me get him.

01:47:56.538 --> 01:47:57.204
Ben!

01:47:57.238 --> 01:47:57.639
Ben!

01:47:57.672 --> 01:47:58.806
Come over here!

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:01.809
Get over here!

01:48:01.843 --> 01:48:02.376
Congratulations, man.

01:48:02.409 --> 01:48:03.978
Thank you.

01:48:04.011 --> 01:48:07.081
Jeff: First of all, that's
a million dollars in there.

01:48:07.114 --> 01:48:08.215
Yes, sir.

01:48:08.249 --> 01:48:10.184
Jeff: It's got a lot of
personal information on there.

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:10.885
That is your check.

01:48:10.918 --> 01:48:11.418
The real deal.

01:48:11.452 --> 01:48:13.254
Oh, wow, wow, wow!

01:48:13.287 --> 01:48:15.256
Jeff: Let's get the family
up.

01:48:15.289 --> 01:48:19.026
Ben's family, come on.

01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:22.229
Get the folks up here, everybody
up here.

01:48:22.263 --> 01:48:24.065
Take it in.

01:48:24.098 --> 01:48:25.533
Gave him a big hug.

01:48:25.567 --> 01:48:26.400
Look at that.

01:48:26.433 --> 01:48:27.168
39 days for this.

01:48:27.201 --> 01:48:35.176
It takes a lot to win this show.

01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:41.382
All right, so, Ben, Ben, come in
here.

01:48:41.415 --> 01:48:42.584
Kelley, get in here.

01:48:42.617 --> 01:48:47.288
So, you know, your husband left,
your son left for six weeks.

01:48:47.321 --> 01:48:48.389
It's a long time.

01:48:48.422 --> 01:48:50.024
You have to manage the fort at
home.

01:48:50.057 --> 01:48:51.325
He's out here doing his thing.

01:48:51.358 --> 01:48:54.562
All the players who have ever
played know how tough it is.

01:48:54.596 --> 01:48:57.665
But when you watch this show
over this long, you really can

01:48:57.699 --> 01:48:58.900
forget.

01:48:58.933 --> 01:49:01.368
So just to remind you, here's a
recap of all the moves it took

01:49:01.402 --> 01:49:05.306
Ben to win this game, and there
were a lot.

01:49:05.339 --> 01:49:10.578
Jeff: Previously on
"survivor":

01:49:10.612 --> 01:49:15.650
On day one, Ben began the game
on the hero tribe but losing the

01:49:15.683 --> 01:49:20.421
first immunity challenge...
hustlers win immunity!

01:49:20.454 --> 01:49:24.025
...forced Ben to form an early
alines.

01:49:24.058 --> 01:49:24.592
He chose Allen.

01:49:24.626 --> 01:49:26.994
I'm not crazy.

01:49:27.028 --> 01:49:28.029
I'm confidence.

01:49:28.062 --> 01:49:33.300
Jeff: But his paranoia
caused Ben to form a new

01:49:33.334 --> 01:49:37.304
alliance with Chrissy, who
became a strong ally and worthy

01:49:37.338 --> 01:49:38.505
adversary.

01:49:38.539 --> 01:49:40.942
Chris sesmart, and that's
going to help me get further in

01:49:40.975 --> 01:49:41.809
the game.

01:49:41.843 --> 01:49:46.013
On day nine... we are switching
tribes.

01:49:46.047 --> 01:49:49.884
...a surprise switch left Ben
the lone hero on a new tribe.

01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:54.421
I have to earn respect and
gain trust to keep my butt in

01:49:54.455 --> 01:49:55.556
the game.

01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:59.160
Jeff: Ben had to rely on
his social game to persuade

01:49:59.193 --> 01:50:02.664
Lauren, a hustler, and Ryan, a
healer to form a new alliance.

01:50:02.697 --> 01:50:07.101
I think Lauren and doc have
the same agenda I do.

01:50:07.134 --> 01:50:12.506
At the merge, Ben reuniteunited
Chrissy and together together

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:16.310
they formed a majority alliance
of heroes and hustlers, and took

01:50:16.343 --> 01:50:17.444
control of the game.

01:50:17.478 --> 01:50:21.082
Moving forward, it's going to
be blindsides and lies.

01:50:21.115 --> 01:50:23.550
Jeff: Their alliance
controlled the vote for several

01:50:23.584 --> 01:50:25.286
tribal councils.

01:50:25.319 --> 01:50:27.454
Jessica, bring me your torch.

01:50:27.488 --> 01:50:28.089
Desi.

01:50:28.122 --> 01:50:28.589
Nicole.

01:50:28.622 --> 01:50:29.056
Good luck, guys.

01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:30.491
Good game, bud.

01:50:30.524 --> 01:50:32.626
Jeff: But nothing lasts
forever on "survivor."

01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:39.100
I mean, there's one person
running the game now, and that's

01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:40.267
Ben.

01:50:40.301 --> 01:50:41.769
Jeff: Joe recognized Ben
was becoming a real threat to

01:50:41.803 --> 01:50:44.706
win the game so he painted a
target on Ben's back.

01:50:44.739 --> 01:50:47.875
They're going on aim for you
right off the bat.

01:50:47.909 --> 01:50:50.344
Ben seven, Lauren six.

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:54.782
Jeff: This forced Ben to
form a suballiance.

01:50:54.816 --> 01:50:56.283
Ben went under cover.

01:50:56.317 --> 01:50:57.484
Obviously, Ben is with us.

01:50:57.518 --> 01:51:00.254
Who do you guys want to vote
for?

01:51:00.287 --> 01:51:02.957
I'm doing my best double-agent
act.

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:08.329
Jeff: And his new alliance
blindsided... tenth person voted

01:51:08.362 --> 01:51:09.063
out jp.

01:51:09.096 --> 01:51:10.297
Jeff: ...His former
alliance.

01:51:10.331 --> 01:51:12.066
The whole thing was a sham.

01:51:12.099 --> 01:51:15.602
Jeff: The game changed
again when Ben senses his new

01:51:15.636 --> 01:51:16.437
alliance was coming for him.

01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:17.238
Ben has to go.

01:51:17.271 --> 01:51:18.172
Asap.

01:51:18.205 --> 01:51:19.707
Jeff: And now Ben was on
his own.

01:51:19.741 --> 01:51:23.044
My wife led me to this one,
so I'm going to go ahead and

01:51:23.077 --> 01:51:23.911
play this one.

01:51:23.945 --> 01:51:27.281
Jeff: This is a hidden
immunity idol.

01:51:27.314 --> 01:51:28.482
Good game, Lauren.

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:31.185
Jeff: With only five days
left, everybody wanted Ben out.

01:51:31.218 --> 01:51:34.722
The longer that guy is in the
game, the longer he could find

01:51:34.756 --> 01:51:35.489
an idol.

01:51:35.522 --> 01:51:36.490
Jeff: But it wouldn't be
easy.

01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:37.191
No way!

01:51:37.224 --> 01:51:39.126
Jeff: Ben was relentless.

01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:43.697
Should we just church this up
and gets to the point because

01:51:43.731 --> 01:51:45.099
I'm not going home tonight.

01:51:45.132 --> 01:51:49.103
Ben is like the bad guy in
any horror movie... he keeps

01:51:49.136 --> 01:51:50.304
coming back to life.

01:51:50.337 --> 01:51:52.639
Jeff: And while everyone
else slept, Ben was fighting for

01:51:52.673 --> 01:51:54.175
his life and found a third idol.

01:51:54.208 --> 01:51:55.209
Oh, my god!

01:51:55.242 --> 01:51:56.477
You think I'm going home?

01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:57.779
Watch this!

01:51:57.812 --> 01:52:05.686
( Whistles )
( Explosion )

01:52:05.719 --> 01:52:06.921
La-la-la.

01:52:06.954 --> 01:52:11.125
Jeff: With no more idols in
the the game... something is not

01:52:11.158 --> 01:52:12.293
right.

01:52:12.326 --> 01:52:15.462
Ben lost the final immunity
challenge to his former ally,

01:52:15.496 --> 01:52:16.230
Chrissy.

01:52:16.263 --> 01:52:17.231
A million dollars was at
stake.

01:52:17.264 --> 01:52:18.933
I just let it slip away.

01:52:18.966 --> 01:52:22.169
Jeff: But a new twist in
the game gave Ben one last shot

01:52:22.203 --> 01:52:24.071
to make it to the final three.

01:52:24.105 --> 01:52:25.873
Jeff: Ben wins!

01:52:25.907 --> 01:52:27.208
Ben seized the moment.

01:52:27.241 --> 01:52:31.312
And on day 39, faced his final
obstacle... the jury.

01:52:31.345 --> 01:52:35.182
I never quit looking, and I
never quit battling against all

01:52:35.216 --> 01:52:35.682
of you all.

01:52:35.716 --> 01:52:38.685
I was not put here.

01:52:38.719 --> 01:52:39.653
I got myself here.

01:52:39.686 --> 01:52:41.555
Make something better for a
lot of veterans.

01:52:41.588 --> 01:52:42.223
( Applause ).

01:52:42.256 --> 01:52:42.990
Jeff: There gu!

01:52:43.024 --> 01:52:45.292
That is what it takes.

01:52:45.326 --> 01:52:50.031
Watching that back, do you
remember how arduous the journey

01:52:50.064 --> 01:52:50.731
is?

01:52:50.764 --> 01:52:52.199
Oh, it was... it was so hard.

01:52:52.233 --> 01:52:54.201
Having, you know, my back up
against the wall.

01:52:54.235 --> 01:52:58.239
I had to fight every single day,
every morning, every night.

01:52:58.272 --> 01:53:00.074
Jeff: You know, talk about
that.

01:53:00.107 --> 01:53:03.077
Because one of the things people
ask me a lot is finding idols.

01:53:03.110 --> 01:53:06.313
How do you keep finding idols?

01:53:06.347 --> 01:53:09.083
Will you put in perspective you
were looking and looking and

01:53:09.116 --> 01:53:09.951
looking.

01:53:09.984 --> 01:53:10.885
You have to go out and find
the idol.

01:53:10.918 --> 01:53:13.520
If you're not look for it, you
won't find it.

01:53:13.554 --> 01:53:16.290
Every morning I went out and
looked for the idol, and I never

01:53:16.323 --> 01:53:17.458
gave up.

01:53:17.491 --> 01:53:20.094
I never quit, and I was... the
early bird gets the worm, I

01:53:20.127 --> 01:53:21.028
guess.

01:53:21.062 --> 01:53:21.929
Jeff: Well,
congratulations, well earned.

01:53:21.963 --> 01:53:22.864
Thanks.

01:53:22.897 --> 01:53:24.231
Jeff: Really great having
you on the show.

01:53:24.265 --> 01:53:25.466
That is what it takes.

01:53:25.499 --> 01:53:29.803
It was a crazy season because on
one hand, you had Chrissy, who

01:53:29.837 --> 01:53:32.006
was a dominant force.

01:53:32.039 --> 01:53:35.409
And then on the other hand, you
had players like Lauren, who

01:53:35.442 --> 01:53:38.679
gave away her idol and then got
vote out that night.

01:53:38.712 --> 01:53:42.383
And that mistake, by the way, is
a nod toward what we're doing

01:53:42.416 --> 01:53:45.652
next season, and I'm so excited
with what we're doing next

01:53:45.686 --> 01:53:48.890
season, I can't wait... I want to
give you a little taste, just a

01:53:48.923 --> 01:53:55.562
few seconds, whet your appetite.

01:54:04.571 --> 01:54:05.806
Jeff: Oh, it's going to be
good.

01:54:05.839 --> 01:54:08.809
We're going to clear the stage,
we'll get some chairs and we'll

01:54:08.842 --> 01:54:11.345
get to gettin'.

01:54:11.378 --> 01:54:13.380
Thed is vie live finale from
L.A.

01:54:14.305 --> 01:54:20.262
