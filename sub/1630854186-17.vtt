00:00.508 --> 00:02.171
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:02.171 --> 00:04.372
Why are you talking
to my husband

00:04.372 --> 00:05.373
about your love life?

00:05.688 --> 00:06.564
You know, Mary,

00:06.564 --> 00:08.066
you might want to be careful

00:08.066 --> 00:09.442
about throwing stones,

00:09.442 --> 00:10.730
'cause I've seen
your glass house.

00:10.730 --> 00:12.665
Hey, it's Missy.
I stole my dad's truck,

00:12.665 --> 00:14.354
I'm running away. Want to come?

00:14.354 --> 00:15.630
Come and get me.

00:15.630 --> 00:17.882
All right, your parents
are on their way.

00:17.882 --> 00:18.925
Are they mad?

00:18.925 --> 00:20.343
If my daughter stole my car

00:20.343 --> 00:21.761
and ran away, I'd be mad.

00:21.761 --> 00:23.388
You may never drive again.

00:23.388 --> 00:25.640
And you are not hanging out
with Paige anymore.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.684
I liked it better
when you two weren't talking.

00:27.684 --> 00:29.769
If you're feeling
ignored, don't worry.

00:29.769 --> 00:30.979
We're gonna be laser-focused

00:30.979 --> 00:32.397
on you
from now on.

Remember,
it's always four claps.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.347
Never three, always four.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.349
You know who claps
three times?

00:57.349 --> 00:58.517
Yankees.

00:58.517 --> 01:01.186
And as Texans, we always
remember the Alamo.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.771
Otherwise, we
might as well

01:02.771 --> 01:05.607
just live in Oklahoma. Blech.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.526
Hey, how long
have you been here?

01:07.526 --> 01:10.112
I just came to check
on her before work.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.156
She was up and you were
snoring like a buzz saw.

01:12.156 --> 01:13.699
I do not snore.

01:13.699 --> 01:14.992
Okay.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.702
Be nice.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.120
You didn't hear it?

01:18.120 --> 01:20.205
I didn't say that.
I said, "Be nice."

01:20.205 --> 01:22.458
Okay, well, thanks for
letting me get some rest.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.584
No problem.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.377
Good morning, CeeCee.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.254
She's fed,
she's changed

01:27.254 --> 01:28.422
and we got through
the first two verses

01:28.422 --> 01:29.840
of "Deep in the
Heart of Texas."

01:29.840 --> 01:30.841
Did you tell her
about the claps?

01:30.841 --> 01:32.134
Of course. Good.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.969
What you planning
for your birthday?

01:33.969 --> 01:35.846
Probably just gonna
take it easy.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.181
Oh, my God.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.350
Saturday's your birthday.
I totally forgot.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.601
Don't worry about it.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.102
Honestly, I don't even
know what today is.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.812
Thursday.
It's Thursday?

01:43.812 --> 01:45.898
Really?
That's weird.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.733
Anyway,
I'm really sorry.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.068
It ain't a big deal.

01:49.068 --> 01:50.319
What do you mean,
it's not a big deal?

01:50.319 --> 01:51.403
You're gonna be 18.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.238
You can legally
buy me cigarettes.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.157
And CeeCee's excited
her dad's

01:55.157 --> 01:56.492
gonna be
an actual adult

01:56.492 --> 01:57.951
and she doesn't have
to change the subject

01:57.951 --> 01:59.995
every time his age comes up.

01:59.995 --> 02:03.165
If I wasn't mature, that'd
probably hurt my feelings.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.084
And you don't have
to get me anything.

02:05.084 --> 02:06.168
She's enough.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.337
Glad you like her.
I didn't save the receipt.

02:08.337 --> 02:10.172
Well, I got to get to work.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.007
Bye, CeeCee.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.426
You miss being 18?

02:14.426 --> 02:17.554
No, pretty happy
where I am right now.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.223
Yeah, me, too.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.433
I'm lying.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.288
My sister was
facing the repercussions

02:43.288 --> 02:45.290
of her recent joyride

02:45.290 --> 02:46.291
by being grounded at home.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.335
No TV!

02:50.629 --> 02:52.214
No music!

02:54.925 --> 02:56.301
No magazines.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.095
If you want,
you can read a book.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.555
I'd rather die.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.473
And I, despite being

03:01.473 --> 03:03.142
innocent of all wrongdoing,

03:03.142 --> 03:04.309
was being punished as well.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.728
Not by my parents,
but by society

03:06.728 --> 03:09.440
and their insistence
on a "spring break."

03:09.440 --> 03:11.483
One whole week of no school.
No fair.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.444
You two should do
something together.

03:13.444 --> 03:15.112
Go outside, take a walk.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.280
I'd rather die.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.406
I'd rather read.

03:18.127 --> 03:20.075
You could make
a card for Georgie.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.326
It's his
birthday Saturday.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.454
You're right, I need
to get him a gift.

03:23.454 --> 03:24.455
I should go to the mall.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.664
You're not going anywhere.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.292
But it's my only brother's
18th birthday.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.501
Excuse me.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.669
Fine, it's my

03:30.669 --> 03:32.629
favorite brother's
18th birthday.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.741
Better.

03:33.741 --> 03:36.508
I got to go to work.
Keep an eye on her.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.342
I will.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.510
I was talking to your father,

03:38.510 --> 03:40.429
but actually, sure.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.473
Bye.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.476
So, are you gonna
be mad at me forever?

03:45.476 --> 03:46.560
No, not forever.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.896
But I'm not gonna be done
anytime soon.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.356
Okay, look, I know I'm grounded
and I'm missing spring break,

03:51.356 --> 03:53.192
and I totally deserve it.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.610
There better not be a "but."

03:54.610 --> 03:55.652
There isn't.

03:56.268 --> 03:58.103
However...

03:58.103 --> 03:59.104
I need to catch up
on 90210

03:59.104 --> 04:00.272
because everyone

04:00.272 --> 04:01.523
will be talking about it Monday,

04:01.523 --> 04:03.275
and if I miss it,
I might as well

04:03.275 --> 04:04.484
not even go back to school.

04:04.484 --> 04:05.694
Too bad.

04:05.694 --> 04:07.321
Come on, even prisoners

04:07.321 --> 04:09.531
get to go out to the yard
for an hour a day.

04:10.782 --> 04:12.284
Fair enough.

04:12.284 --> 04:15.037
There's the yard.
Knock yourself out.

04:16.413 --> 04:18.707
I know a way for you
to watch whatever you want.

04:18.707 --> 04:20.125
How?

04:20.125 --> 04:21.501
Your imagination.

04:21.501 --> 04:23.378
That's stupid.

04:23.378 --> 04:25.130

a German folk song about it?

04:49.905 --> 04:52.657

days ago. I think I'm set.

04:52.657 --> 04:55.369
Those baths aren't just for you.

04:56.370 --> 04:58.330
Hey, I was thinking about
doing something nice

04:58.330 --> 04:59.289
for Georgie's birthday.

04:59.289 --> 05:01.833
How nice?
'Cause I'm all set

05:01.833 --> 05:03.668
with great-grandchildren
for now.

05:03.668 --> 05:06.171
Well, I just gave birth
and he's seeing another woman,

05:06.171 --> 05:08.340
so I was thinking maybe a cake

05:08.340 --> 05:10.884
and some of his favorite food.

05:10.884 --> 05:12.594
That's sweet, you're gonna cook.

05:12.594 --> 05:16.181
Actually, uh...

05:17.391 --> 05:18.433
Okay.

05:18.433 --> 05:21.353
I'll do the food,
you handle the cake.

05:21.353 --> 05:22.604
Great.

05:22.604 --> 05:25.607

know how to bake?

We're calling
her CeeCee.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.416
Well, that's
just the cutest.

05:42.416 --> 05:44.084
Mm-hmm.

05:44.793 --> 05:47.796

05:47.796 --> 05:49.381
Don't worry,

05:49.381 --> 05:50.590
it's not the sludge we serve.

05:50.590 --> 05:53.218
I got it from the 7-Eleven
on the corner.

05:53.218 --> 05:55.220
Thank you, but I'm fine.

05:55.220 --> 05:56.388
Are you sure?

05:56.388 --> 05:57.639

05:59.182 --> 06:00.475
Fancy.

06:00.475 --> 06:03.770
I really have a lot of
work to catch up on.

06:03.770 --> 06:05.397
Of course.

06:05.397 --> 06:06.648
Well, I will leave you to it.

06:06.648 --> 06:08.900
But later on,

06:08.900 --> 06:10.402
I want to see pictures
of that baby.

06:10.402 --> 06:11.653
I don't have any with me.

06:11.653 --> 06:14.573
Well, you can
describe her to me.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.618
She's about yay big

06:18.618 --> 06:20.203
and bald.

06:20.203 --> 06:22.247
Nothing you ain't seen before.

06:23.039 --> 06:24.458
Sounds adorable.

06:27.085 --> 06:28.253
Do you want this
open or...

06:28.253 --> 06:30.255
Closed.
Yep.

06:49.107 --> 06:50.358
What are you doing?

06:50.358 --> 06:52.944
Nothing, go away.

06:52.944 --> 06:54.488
You're not allowed to watch TV.

06:54.488 --> 06:56.823
Sheldon, let me have this.

06:57.699 --> 06:59.784
While Dad's gone,
I'm the man of the house,

06:59.784 --> 07:02.204
and the man of the house
has to enforce the rules.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.539
The man of the house is about
to get his teeth knocked out.

07:04.539 --> 07:06.583
Puberty's made
you mean.

07:06.583 --> 07:08.627
I need to know
what happened on my show.

07:08.627 --> 07:09.586
And you'll find out

07:09.586 --> 07:10.837
when your privileges
are restored.

07:10.837 --> 07:12.005
I can't wait that long,

07:12.005 --> 07:13.632
each episode builds on the last.

07:13.632 --> 07:16.968
Imagine a Star Trek that ends
with "to be continued,"

07:16.968 --> 07:18.303
and you don't get
to continue.

07:18.303 --> 07:20.805
That would never happen,
because I follow the rules.

07:21.723 --> 07:24.309
You are this close
to a purple nurple.

07:25.310 --> 07:27.479
You leave my
nurples alone.

07:32.776 --> 07:34.152
Yes?

07:34.986 --> 07:36.238
Hey, Mary,

07:36.238 --> 07:37.405
you get a chance

07:37.405 --> 07:39.407
to send out those checks?

07:39.407 --> 07:42.077
Not yet, but
I'll get to it.

07:42.077 --> 07:43.745
All right.

07:43.745 --> 07:45.163
It's just that,

07:45.163 --> 07:46.915
the checks
to the vendors

07:46.915 --> 07:50.335
go out on Tuesdays,
and it's Thursday.

07:50.335 --> 07:53.004
I know the days
of the week, Brenda.

07:53.004 --> 07:54.839
Okay.

07:54.839 --> 07:56.550
You want checks?

07:56.550 --> 07:57.842
Here's checks.

07:59.010 --> 08:01.846
Mancuso Maintenance.

08:01.846 --> 08:04.683
$45.

08:04.683 --> 08:06.226
There you go.

08:06.226 --> 08:08.520
Mary...
Lone Star Vending.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.021
$200.

08:10.021 --> 08:12.065
Okay, if you're mad,
just talk to me

08:12.065 --> 08:14.359
instead of
whatever this is.

08:14.359 --> 08:15.610
I'm not mad.

08:15.610 --> 08:17.445
Okay, come on, Mary.
We're friends.

08:17.445 --> 08:20.198
Just not as good of friends

08:20.198 --> 08:22.450
as you are with my husband.

08:22.450 --> 08:24.035
Okay, if you're gonna
keep working here,

08:24.035 --> 08:25.579
we have to figure this out.

08:25.579 --> 08:26.830
Maybe I shouldn't work here.

08:26.830 --> 08:28.623
Maybe you shouldn't.
Are you firing me?

08:28.623 --> 08:30.417
Well, I thought
you were quitting.

08:30.417 --> 08:32.252
Maybe I was.
Then maybe I was.

08:32.252 --> 08:33.545
Then I am.

08:33.545 --> 08:34.546
Then I do.

08:34.546 --> 08:36.840
Great, then I'm leaving.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.884
Well, I'm a little
confused, but okay.

08:48.515 --> 08:49.892
Mary, you're home early.

08:49.892 --> 08:52.102
I'm sorry, am
I bothering you?

08:52.102 --> 08:54.521
No, just thought
you'd still be at work.

08:54.521 --> 08:56.857
Well, I'm not.

08:56.857 --> 08:58.108
I don't work
there anymore.

08:58.108 --> 08:59.777
Brenda and I
got in a fight.

08:59.777 --> 09:01.987
Wait, what?

09:01.987 --> 09:03.197
Did you get fired?

09:03.197 --> 09:05.574
Yes. Or maybe I quit.

09:05.574 --> 09:07.242
I don't know, it's unclear.

09:07.242 --> 09:09.578
Well, whichever one it was,

09:09.578 --> 09:11.705
I'm on your side. Screw Brenda.

09:11.705 --> 09:13.874
You don't even know
what happened.

09:15.042 --> 09:17.711
You're right. Sorry.
What happened?

09:17.711 --> 09:21.340
Well, Brenda was
being overly nice,

09:21.340 --> 09:23.383
which really
rubbed me the wrong way,

09:23.383 --> 09:24.885
so I tore her head off.

09:24.885 --> 09:27.221
Well, I don't see
what choice you had.

09:27.221 --> 09:29.139
George, don't.

09:29.139 --> 09:30.432
What? I'm on your side.

09:31.225 --> 09:33.018
Why do I even
tell you anything?

09:36.396 --> 09:38.315
Love you!

09:42.986 --> 09:44.988
Missy, are you busy?

09:44.988 --> 09:46.740
Do I look busy?

09:46.740 --> 09:48.909
I do some of my best thinking
lying down.

09:48.909 --> 09:50.744
Yeah, well, I'm not thinking.

09:50.744 --> 09:53.497
The shower is another
excellent place to cogitate.

09:53.497 --> 09:55.082
Sometimes I'll just
lather up and drift off...

09:55.082 --> 09:56.959
What do you want, Sheldon?

09:56.959 --> 09:58.752
Well, I was thinking about
what you said about Star Trek

09:58.752 --> 10:00.754
and how it'd be hard to watch
part one and not part two.

10:00.754 --> 10:02.756
So I can watch 90210?

10:02.756 --> 10:05.092
No, but I can offer you
the next best thing:

10:05.092 --> 10:07.427
Theater of the mind.

10:07.427 --> 10:09.596
This is why people hate you.

10:09.596 --> 10:11.056
No, I've watched your program,

10:11.056 --> 10:12.349
and I can tell you
everything that happened.

10:12.349 --> 10:13.642
So you know what happens

10:13.642 --> 10:14.977
with Brandon's gambling problem?

10:14.977 --> 10:16.436
And how Dylan
and Kelly are doing?

10:16.436 --> 10:18.730
I do. Okay.

10:18.730 --> 10:20.440
Wait, why would
you do that for me?

10:20.440 --> 10:22.568
Well, when you tried
to watch the tape,

10:22.568 --> 10:24.444
I ended up watching
the first 12 seconds of it,

10:24.444 --> 10:26.155
and the completist in me
had to finish it.

10:26.155 --> 10:27.239
That's so dumb.

10:27.239 --> 10:30.450
I love it. Tell me everything.

10:30.450 --> 10:32.703
Well, it starts off
with Kelly

10:32.703 --> 10:34.288
working out on
an exercise machine.

10:34.288 --> 10:35.664
Oh, she's
dating Dylan,

10:35.664 --> 10:37.291
who was dating
her best friend.

10:37.291 --> 10:39.042
Mm-hmm.

10:39.042 --> 10:40.836
She gets sweatier and
sweatier, which I'm assuming

10:40.836 --> 10:42.004
is because of
the exercise,

10:42.004 --> 10:43.255
although it could
be the weather.

10:43.255 --> 10:45.048
Los Angeles is
the land of sun and fun.

10:45.048 --> 10:46.216
Did she look upset?

10:46.216 --> 10:49.136
Hard to say.
She looked sweaty.

10:49.136 --> 10:50.637
What happens next?

10:50.637 --> 10:52.181
Well, then she
and her brother, David,

10:52.181 --> 10:54.308
get into a very heated
argument over a banana.

10:54.308 --> 10:55.642
That doesn't
sound right.

10:55.642 --> 10:57.519
Well, in the next
scene at school,

10:57.519 --> 10:58.937
everyone gets quiet
when Kelly walks up.

10:58.937 --> 11:00.355
I'm assuming it's
because of the banana tiff.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.815
There's no way

11:01.815 --> 11:03.317
the episode
was about a banana.

11:03.317 --> 11:04.651
I'm sorry,
did you watch it?

11:04.651 --> 11:06.320
What else happened?

11:06.320 --> 11:07.487
Oh, they're also
planning Kelly

11:07.487 --> 11:08.697
a surprise
birthday party.

11:08.697 --> 11:10.449
Well, that's why
they got quiet.

11:10.449 --> 11:11.825
How could you
not get that?

11:11.825 --> 11:13.285
No one said it
out loud.

11:13.285 --> 11:15.621
You have to pay attention
to how they're acting.

11:15.621 --> 11:17.497
Their faces
and body language.

11:17.497 --> 11:19.666
You mean for subtext?

11:19.666 --> 11:21.001
Yeah, subtext.

11:21.001 --> 11:23.337
I hate subtext,
I prefer text.

11:23.337 --> 11:24.671
Then just listen
to the music.

11:24.671 --> 11:26.340
If it's sad,
they're sad.

11:26.340 --> 11:27.925
It's happy,
they're happy.

11:27.925 --> 11:28.800
Interesting.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.135
So the music's
like a cheat sheet

11:30.135 --> 11:31.386
to help read
social cues?

11:31.386 --> 11:32.387
Exactly.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.014
Look at that,

11:34.014 --> 11:35.474
spring break
and I'm still learning.

11:37.768 --> 11:39.394
George said
he was on my side,

11:39.394 --> 11:40.854
but if he was really

11:40.854 --> 11:43.148
on my side, he wouldn't
say he was on my side

11:43.148 --> 11:44.858
like he had to
calm down a crazy woman.

11:44.858 --> 11:47.861
You know, I can just
buy Georgie a cake.

11:47.861 --> 11:49.196
All righty,

11:49.196 --> 11:50.989
I got everything
we need

11:50.989 --> 11:53.283
to make
chicken-fried steak

11:53.283 --> 11:55.202
and mac and cheese
and tater tots.

11:55.202 --> 11:56.870
Healthy.

11:56.870 --> 11:58.205
You said make his favorite meal.

11:58.205 --> 12:00.207
What'd you think that
was gonna be, a carrot?

12:00.207 --> 12:01.708
And it's fine,

12:01.708 --> 12:03.293
I will make the cake.

12:03.293 --> 12:04.378
Thank you.

12:04.378 --> 12:05.754
I've got plenty of time.

12:05.754 --> 12:07.589
It's not like
I have a job to go to.

12:07.589 --> 12:08.882
What happened?

12:08.882 --> 12:10.592
You don't want to know.

12:10.592 --> 12:12.177
Sold.

12:12.660 --> 12:13.661
We're home.

12:13.661 --> 12:15.668
Hey, how was
your walk?
Slow.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.404
You don't know
how many old ladies

12:17.404 --> 12:18.780
are in the neighborhood
till you go out with a baby.

12:18.780 --> 12:19.925
Ooh, tots.

12:19.925 --> 12:21.449
Hey, hands off.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.867
Oh, uh, they're
for Saturday.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.619
We thought we'd make
you a birthday dinner.

12:24.619 --> 12:27.372
Oh, shoot.
Amber's taking me out.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.291
Oh, I thought you said
you didn't have plans.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.459
Well, I...

12:31.459 --> 12:32.460
I didn't, she just asked.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.962
Can't you cancel?

12:33.962 --> 12:35.296
No, it's...
it's okay.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.256
It's your birthday,

12:36.256 --> 12:37.674
you should do
what you want to do.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.260
Maybe we can do
family dinner on Sunday?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.470
Of course. Great.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.930
I got to go clean her up,

12:43.930 --> 12:45.557
she's got old lady lipstick
on her head.

12:45.557 --> 12:48.226
Well, you're an old lady. How
do you get that lipstick off?

12:49.060 --> 12:51.521
All right,
I'll figure it out myself.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.694
What you watching?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.904
Beverly Hills 90210.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.073
Isn't that Missy's show?
Yes,

13:02.073 --> 13:03.283
I'm trying to do a better job

13:03.283 --> 13:05.160
of picking up on the characters'
emotional states.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.120
So, for example,
this scene

13:07.120 --> 13:09.414
seems like it's
about expired food,

13:09.414 --> 13:10.999
but thanks to
the ominous music, I can tell

13:10.999 --> 13:12.584
it's about
Kelly's eating disorder.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.252
Give it a try.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.464
Well, let's see. Uh...

13:17.464 --> 13:18.756
That one's upset
'cause he's 30 years old

13:18.756 --> 13:20.133
and still in high school.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.759
That's what
I thought, too,

13:21.759 --> 13:23.094
but it turns out his father

13:23.094 --> 13:24.304
recently died
in a car explosion.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.764
Oh. Well, I can see why
that would make him sad.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.516
Hold on.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.767
Sad music, yep.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.519
You're good at this.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.286
What?

13:48.286 --> 13:51.164
I'm not leaving
until we talk this out.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.666
My mom's upset.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.335
Did you get it? Listen.

14:02.979 --> 14:04.480
We have nothing
to talk about.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.442
Fine. Then let's just
yell at each other.

14:07.442 --> 14:08.720
I'm not yelling at you.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.422
Mary, we're neighbors,
our kids are friends.

14:11.422 --> 14:12.715
We're gonna be
in each other's lives

14:12.715 --> 14:14.508
for a long time. Let's do this.

14:14.508 --> 14:16.886
I am busy.
I am making a cake.

14:16.886 --> 14:18.762
And I'm talking to
a pain in the ass

14:18.762 --> 14:20.264
who won't admit
she's mad.

14:20.264 --> 14:21.432
I'm not mad.

14:21.432 --> 14:22.725
Really?

14:24.768 --> 14:26.937
How about now?

14:26.937 --> 14:27.980
Back yard.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.816
Do you even
think about

14:30.816 --> 14:32.610
how your actions
affect other people?

14:32.610 --> 14:34.528
Love it. Keep it coming.

14:34.528 --> 14:35.988
You couldn't hang on
to your crappy husband,

14:35.988 --> 14:38.741
so you tried to move in
on my crappy husband.

14:38.741 --> 14:41.493
Good, good. That hurt, but good.

14:45.698 --> 14:48.446
Mm, I love me
some Chi-Chi's.

14:48.446 --> 14:49.930
You're a cheap date.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.390
You say that now.
Wait till you see

14:51.390 --> 14:53.017
how many chimichangas
I can put away.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.437
It's your birthday.
Have as many as you want.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.938
You may regret that.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.275
Thanks again
for taking me out.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.361
You don't want to
spend the night at home

15:03.361 --> 15:04.612
with some crying baby.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.156
I don't know.
When it's your kid,

15:07.156 --> 15:08.866
the crying doesn't
bother you as much.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.661
You're not gonna be
one of those parents

15:11.661 --> 15:13.663
that brings their babies
to restaurants, are you?

15:13.663 --> 15:14.513
You bet.

15:14.513 --> 15:17.291
Wrap her up like a burrito,
she'd fit right in.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.460
Well, tonight,

15:19.460 --> 15:21.462
you don't have
to think about that.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.506
We can just have fun.

15:24.215 --> 15:26.217
I like the sound of that.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.135
You do mean sex, right?

15:28.135 --> 15:29.929
What do you think?

15:29.929 --> 15:33.474
Hmm, maybe I shouldn't
get the chimichangas.

15:34.046 --> 15:35.839
And then
she sees Dylan

15:35.839 --> 15:37.550
in the hallway and tells her

15:37.550 --> 15:38.467
that she and Kelly
are friends again,

15:38.467 --> 15:40.010
and he kisses her
on the forehead.

15:40.010 --> 15:41.220
What kind of kiss was it?

15:41.220 --> 15:42.846
Well, it seemed innocent,

15:42.846 --> 15:44.723
but the music was mysterious,

15:44.723 --> 15:47.184
indicating that their love
triangle will totally continue.

15:47.184 --> 15:48.727
Well, that's juicy.

15:48.727 --> 15:49.770
Oh, I'm aware.

15:49.770 --> 15:51.021
If you want,

15:51.021 --> 15:52.022
you can watch with me next week.

15:52.022 --> 15:53.524
No, thank you.

15:53.524 --> 15:56.360
Although, I would like to know
who killed Dylan's dad.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.029
Plus, what happened
to David's recording contract.

15:59.029 --> 16:00.239
Do you really think
he's going to

16:00.239 --> 16:01.532
let that producer
change his sound?

16:01.532 --> 16:03.367
Boy, I hope not.

16:03.367 --> 16:05.536
I hear you, sister.

16:05.536 --> 16:07.580
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

16:07.580 --> 16:10.416
to have your husband
prefer to hang out

16:10.416 --> 16:11.792
with your best friend over you?

16:11.792 --> 16:14.628
I know how it feels
to have my husband leave me.

16:14.628 --> 16:16.380
Then you should know better.

16:17.381 --> 16:18.716
You're right.

16:19.883 --> 16:22.970
I mean, I get that you're fun,

16:22.970 --> 16:24.388
and I'm just

16:24.388 --> 16:27.141
a churchy stick-in-the-mud.

16:27.141 --> 16:29.518
Mary, I don't even think
it was about me.

16:29.518 --> 16:31.228
It could've been anybody.

16:31.228 --> 16:33.564
That doesn't make me
feel better.

16:33.564 --> 16:35.441
I just mean I'm not his wife.

16:35.441 --> 16:37.943
Which makes me
easier to talk to.

16:38.819 --> 16:42.114
Don't make it right,
but talk's all it was.

16:42.114 --> 16:43.574
Are you sure?

16:43.574 --> 16:45.409
I swear.

16:46.151 --> 16:48.946
Like how sometimes it was easier

16:48.946 --> 16:51.865
for you to talk to Pastor Rob?

16:54.672 --> 16:57.842
But shouldn't George and I want
to talk to each other?

16:57.842 --> 16:59.552
Don't ask me,

16:59.552 --> 17:02.555
I couldn't hang on
to my "crappy husband."

17:03.314 --> 17:04.380
Sorry about that.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.201
No.

17:06.201 --> 17:07.160
It's true.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.621
You want to talk about it?

17:11.289 --> 17:12.916
That'd be nice.

17:14.042 --> 17:16.127
George around?

17:17.003 --> 17:18.630
Okay, not ready to joke.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.421
Hey.
Hey.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.341
Oh, quick, scratch my nose.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.011
Oh, nothing's ever felt better.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.805
I'm offended.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.744
Hey, what time is it?

17:39.744 --> 17:41.225
About 8:30.

17:41.225 --> 17:42.935
You're home early.

17:42.935 --> 17:44.729
Yeah.

17:44.729 --> 17:46.897
How was your date?

17:46.897 --> 17:50.651
Actually, we broke up.

17:50.651 --> 17:52.320
Oh.

17:54.488 --> 17:55.573
What happened?

17:55.573 --> 17:58.451
Nothing, I just
wanted to be here.

17:59.577 --> 18:01.078
Really?

18:01.078 --> 18:03.205
Yeah.

18:04.248 --> 18:06.626
That's what we wanted, too.

18:18.372 --> 18:20.249
Happy birthday.

18:21.292 --> 18:22.168
There is
something else

18:22.168 --> 18:23.878
you could do
for my birthday.

18:23.878 --> 18:26.964
I had a baby
two weeks ago. No.

18:26.964 --> 18:28.466
Not that.

18:28.466 --> 18:30.384
Then what?

18:30.829 --> 18:31.830
Marry me.
