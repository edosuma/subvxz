{\an8}- Ooh, the Fenski 15.

00:37.971 --> 00:38.905
{\an8}- What's that?

00:38.972 --> 00:40.240
{\an8}- The Fenski 15.

00:40.306 --> 00:42.242
{\an8}- You repeating exactly
what you just said

00:42.308 --> 00:44.144
{\an8}does not clear up
my confusion.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.779
{\an8}- It's a bike relay race.

00:45.845 --> 00:48.648
{\an8}Teams of four take turns doing
laps around the track.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.151
{\an8}First team to 15...wins.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.787
{\an8}- Now that's how you
answer a question.

00:53.853 --> 00:55.655
{\an8}- I'm putting together a team.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.024
{\an8}Dallas said yes.
You guys in?

00:58.091 --> 01:01.961
{\an8}The winners get free passes
to Coaster Island!

01:02.028 --> 01:03.263
{\an8}- Coaster Island?

01:03.329 --> 01:05.532
{\an8}That place is even better
than Coaster Country.

01:05.598 --> 01:06.833
{\an8}I'm in.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.501
{\an8}- Sam? What about you?

01:08.568 --> 01:10.303
{\an8}You wanna ride?

01:11.671 --> 01:14.274
{\an8}- [sighing] I've never
told anybody this--

01:14.340 --> 01:17.243
{\an8}I don't know how
to ride a bike!

01:17.310 --> 01:20.246
{\an8}- One spot left.
What do you say?

01:20.313 --> 01:22.849
{\an8}- Um, I love riding bikes.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.518
{\an8}I mean, I absolutely
love it.

01:25.585 --> 01:26.986
{\an8}But, uh...

01:27.053 --> 01:28.922
{\an8}my grandma's taking
me to the zoo.

01:28.988 --> 01:30.190
{\an8}- What?

01:30.256 --> 01:31.758
{\an8}Momo didn't mention that.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.426
{\an8}- Oh, hey, look!
There's Logan.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.261
{\an8}I bet Logan wants to be
on the bike team.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.363
{\an8}- Yes! Racing, yes!

01:37.430 --> 01:39.866
{\an8}- I'll take that as a yes.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.167
{\an8}- Well, hey, Carter.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.203

02:00.320 --> 02:01.921
- Who's on your team?

02:01.988 --> 02:03.490
- I got three eighth graders.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.692
One of them's almost
got a mustache.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.727
See you at the finish line.

02:10.062 --> 02:11.231
Okay...

02:11.297 --> 02:12.966
- GIGI: You might wanna
work on backing up.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.400
- Bye, Gigi!

02:18.671 --> 02:21.074
- All right, guys,
we have to focus.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.909
Dallas, what are you doing?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.377
- Oh, I got this
new bike racing game

02:24.444 --> 02:25.778
so I could practice
for the race.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.146
I can't stop playing it.

02:27.213 --> 02:28.915
- What about the actual race?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.483
- Oh, yeah.
When is that?

02:30.550 --> 02:32.252
- It's today.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.889
- Bike like the wind,
Video Game Dallas.

02:35.955 --> 02:38.925
- Logan! Where have you been?
You're our best rider.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.195
- You mean was our best rider.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.230
- Bad news, guys.
I can't race.

02:44.297 --> 02:46.099
I took a bad spill
on my bike, uh,

02:46.165 --> 02:49.335
doing a no-hander
onto a 360 can-can.

02:49.402 --> 02:52.605
Actually I got attacked
by a locker.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.973
Hey.
- [locker slams]

02:54.040 --> 02:55.942
- Argh! Aah!

- Sorry, Logan.

02:57.143 --> 02:58.578
I'll never hurt you again.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.446
I'm gonna make you
better, bae.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.216
Don't worry,
my locker's fine.

03:03.283 --> 03:04.751
- What are we gonna do?

03:04.817 --> 03:07.487
We need four players on our team
or we're gonna get disqualified.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.455
- We'll just ask
Sam to fill in.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.691
Trust me.
Sam won't let us down.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.192
He's on the team.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.761
- I'm on the what?

03:14.827 --> 03:16.296
- The team.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.165
I told them Sam Duda
does not let his friends down,

03:19.232 --> 03:21.501
especially when it
comes to bike racing--

03:21.568 --> 03:23.469
which you love.
[chomps chip]

03:23.536 --> 03:25.772
- When people find out
I can't ride a bike,

03:25.838 --> 03:27.574
I'm gonna be humiliated--

just like when they found
out I couldn't say

03:30.643 --> 03:38.651
spergers...as...perasaurs
...asberg...sp...

03:38.718 --> 03:40.920
Tyler, I need to tell
you something.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.889
- I know you can't
say "asparagus."

03:42.956 --> 03:44.223
It's fine.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.625
We've learned to
deal with it.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.460
- I don't know how
to ride a bike.

03:47.527 --> 03:48.428
- What?

03:48.494 --> 03:50.163
I've seen you ride
a bike before.

03:50.229 --> 03:51.864
- No, you haven't.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.866
I'm always on my scooter.

03:53.933 --> 03:56.035
Think about it.

03:56.102 --> 03:59.339
- Oh, my gosh!
You're right.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.108
I just thought you
really loved to scoot.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.876
- No one loves to scoot.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.345
- That's crazy.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.813
- No way I can race.

04:06.879 --> 04:11.150
- Look, we need four people on
the team and you're a people.

04:11.217 --> 04:13.920
So, I'm gonna teach you
how to ride a bike.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.622
- Can you really teach me?

04:15.688 --> 04:18.257
- If I can teach dad how to send
an email, I can do anything.

04:18.324 --> 04:20.326
[crunching chip]

04:20.392 --> 04:24.263
All right, bike riding
is all about being alert, so...

me to ride a bike?

04:40.046 --> 04:42.382
- [water spritzing]

04:42.448 --> 04:46.686
- Okay, the other important
thing is to gain speed early.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.721
- I don't wanna gain
speed early.

I literally do not know
how to ride a bike.

I'm seven laps in.

- We've been...

05:25.224 --> 05:26.626
riding bikes.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.495
You know, pushing pedals
with our feet.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.831
That's something
I know how to do.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.167
I am in a bike race.

05:34.233 --> 05:35.268
- Yeah.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.236
- Why are you acting so weird?

05:37.303 --> 05:38.504
- What?

05:38.571 --> 05:39.672
No.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.107
It's nothing.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.309
It's just that I can't--

05:43.376 --> 05:46.112
- I can't wait to
kick everyone's butt

05:46.179 --> 05:47.914
in that bike race.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.282
Me, too, Sam.

05:49.348 --> 05:50.583
- Good work.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.852
- [bike bell tinging]
- Keep practicing.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.858

Coaster Island.

05:58.925 --> 06:02.161
I'm gonna ride Tornado Twister,
Maniac Mountain

06:02.228 --> 06:04.197
and the Sleepy-Time Trolley.

Psst! Hey, Tyler!

06:09.669 --> 06:13.773
Yeah, you! You!
Come on! Now! Get!

06:13.840 --> 06:16.375
Okay, Tyler, so the team
needs Sam Duda to race

06:16.442 --> 06:19.679
and I can't do that,
but I found a solution.

06:19.746 --> 06:23.516
Meet "Sam Duda."

06:23.583 --> 06:26.486
No one will ever
know he's not me.

- Sam, you're not even
thinking straight.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.823
- Which Sam Duda
are you talking to?

06:30.890 --> 06:34.494
- The one that's gonna get on
that bike and ride it for real.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.963
- But I'm gonna
humiliate myself.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.832
- Sam, I know you're worried
everyone's gonna laugh at you.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.335
But you'll never
learn unless you try.

06:42.401 --> 06:45.037
And whatever happens,
I got your back.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.910

06:50.977 --> 06:52.612
one lap, one lap, one lap.

06:52.678 --> 06:54.280
I do twelve laps
and win the race.

to lose this one!

It's that Carter.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.410
Oh, yeah!

07:57.476 --> 08:00.079

08:00.146 --> 08:02.248
But Dallas is making her move!

08:02.315 --> 08:05.985
- DALLAS:

Faster, faster, faster!

You're better than that!

Is something wrong with Sam?

There you go.
There you go.

Why isn't this a video game?

Faster! Leave, leave!
Oh, my goodness!

gonna take it from here.

08:40.553 --> 08:41.821

08:41.888 --> 08:45.258
All you have to do is
one lap and then we win.

08:45.324 --> 08:46.959
Coaster Island will be ours.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.494
It all depends on you.

08:48.561 --> 08:51.530

- Sam Man and Freako Rico
are comin' for you.

19:36.608 --> 19:39.011
- He knows this isn't
pro-wrestling, right?

19:39.077 --> 19:41.079
It's real wrestling.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.981
- So real!

19:43.048 --> 19:44.416
Sorry, Gigi.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.251
You know wrestling's
my passion.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.588
- Hey, Rico, it's Sam.

19:49.655 --> 19:50.856
Well, you knew that.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.425
Time to drop the hammer.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.193
Oh, no!

19:55.260 --> 19:57.195
Rico, what have I done?

19:57.262 --> 19:58.997
You were the best
part of me!

20:04.736 --> 20:08.006
Whoa, that's a lotta Ricos.

- [snorting]

20:11.677 --> 20:13.679
- SAM: It's not too late
to be friends.

20:13.745 --> 20:15.647
What do you say
we call it a tie?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.683
- [snorting]
- I can't watch this.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.751
- SAM: Gentle Ben!
Buddy! Come on.

20:19.818 --> 20:24.356
- Me either.
Well, maybe just a little.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.595

the police!

20:29.661 --> 20:33.231
- Ooh!
- That's gotta hurt.

20:33.298 --> 20:35.934

20:41.440 --> 20:43.375
- No, I'm probably
gonna go home.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.710
I don't want nightmares.

20:46.378 --> 20:48.513

- Ow! That was just mean.

20:56.521 --> 20:57.456
Tyler?

20:57.522 --> 20:58.991
- Tag me in.

20:59.057 --> 21:01.393
- That's not really
how it works.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.728
- Do it for Rico.

21:12.871 --> 21:15.807
- TYLER:
You can do it.

21:15.874 --> 21:18.310
Come on, you can do it.

21:22.347 --> 21:25.017
If you wanna get
to my brother,

21:25.083 --> 21:27.152
you're gonna have to
go through me.

21:32.658 --> 21:35.527
- [heavy thud]
- He did.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.663
He did go through me.

21:37.729 --> 21:40.866
- Ouch.
- Ow.

21:40.932 --> 21:42.334
Ah, ouch.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.503
- Thanks for helping me out.

21:44.569 --> 21:45.937
I guess I still have
a lot to learn

21:46.004 --> 21:48.607
and seventh grade isn't
as easy as I thought.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.809
- Hey, this is new
for me, too.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.444
We'll figure it out
together, bro.

21:52.511 --> 21:56.481
- So where'd you get the guts
to stand up to Gentle Ben?

21:56.548 --> 21:58.450
- Say hello to Tyler Junior.
