The BEAT BENEATH my FEET

00:28.661 --> 00:31.330
Schooled Southside
beneath the King of Beasts

00:31.332 --> 00:33.665
Back in PigFat, St Louis

00:33.667 --> 00:36.035
The air was gravid with heat,
sex and hops

00:36.037 --> 00:38.203
They made the beer,
drank it when they got off

00:38.205 --> 00:40.706
This is what you gotta do

00:40.708 --> 00:44.076
But I just want to scratch the groove

00:45.645 --> 00:48.147
Pick a partner, pick a domicile

00:48.149 --> 00:52.651
My choice was to pick them all
lying, flying, like men blankly do

00:52.653 --> 00:55.220
Girl, you're in the wrong
neighbourhood

00:55.222 --> 00:57.523
This is what you gotta do

00:57.525 --> 01:00.159
But I don't care,
I'll smash the groove

01:00.161 --> 01:02.528
This is what you gotta do now

01:02.530 --> 01:07.332
This is what you gotta do now
This is what you must do

01:07.334 --> 01:10.135
But I'm going to
rough up the groove

01:14.407 --> 01:18.744
- Tom. Where's your helmet?
- I chained it to my bike.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.413
- You are using it, aren't you, Tom?
- Yes, Mum.

01:21.415 --> 01:26.785
Do you know the number of people that would
still be alive if they'd worn a helmet?

01:28.354 --> 01:33.292
- Did you see those paramedics?
- Yeah. The old lady downstairs.

01:38.231 --> 01:41.200
Maybe if she would
have worn a helmet.

01:57.884 --> 02:00.285
He walks inside

02:01.287 --> 02:03.455
Steals a wink

02:04.557 --> 02:09.828
You try to explain but
you ain't got time to think

02:11.131 --> 02:13.499
You know he's bad news

02:14.300 --> 02:16.635
But you take a glance

02:17.770 --> 02:22.908
His headlines say you're on the
right page for romancing

02:22.910 --> 02:25.511
You just fall

02:27.313 --> 02:32.184
Oh yeah you fall for those eyes

02:34.787 --> 02:36.188
Tom!

02:47.934 --> 02:52.571
What you should have is Na2 SO4...

02:53.506 --> 02:56.508
...our old friend sodium sulphate.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.211
Tom Heath.

02:59.445 --> 03:00.512
Tom?

03:01.281 --> 03:02.481
Tom!

03:02.483 --> 03:04.850
Since you're so far ahead of us...

03:04.852 --> 03:08.687
...why don't you come up here
and talk us through the answer.

03:12.325 --> 03:13.692
Come on.

03:30.810 --> 03:31.877
Tom.

03:33.846 --> 03:34.880
Tom!

03:38.251 --> 03:39.284
Tom!

03:40.520 --> 03:42.387
Mr. Freeze.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.288
Hi, love!

04:24.530 --> 04:25.897
Nature's beauty
from God with love

04:25.899 --> 04:27.299
Thank you, God.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.272
Tom-kins.

04:36.309 --> 04:37.809
Everything okay?

04:58.598 --> 05:01.967
Watch that movie

05:05.305 --> 05:07.973
Watch it, watch it, watch me

05:07.975 --> 05:14.313
Found me bottom-up,
bottled-up and refused since eye-ope

05:14.614 --> 05:20.552
But he saw a suck,
picked me up and my spirit poured

05:21.321 --> 05:26.658
We lived mouth to mouth, mouth
to south, hands round my neck

05:42.775 --> 05:44.443
Mr. Freeze.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.645
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.413
Signing up for that?

05:53.487 --> 05:59.391
Look, we got some pretty serious
competition for Battle of the Bands, so...

06:01.627 --> 06:04.463
Come on. Entertain us.
Show us what you can do.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.465
Damien.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.432
No?

06:08.701 --> 06:12.070
Then give me my guitar
and shove off. Go on.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.383
And close the door on
your way out, please!

07:13.566 --> 07:18.470
Loser

07:23.042 --> 07:27.112
Loser

07:46.933 --> 07:48.967
YOU ARE A LOSER

07:51.804 --> 07:56.675
Loser

07:57.810 --> 07:59.845
TOM IS A LOSER

08:02.148 --> 08:06.218
Loser

08:06.986 --> 08:08.854
LOSER ALERT!

08:11.257 --> 08:13.492
Loser

08:13.926 --> 08:15.694
LOSER

08:20.933 --> 08:23.201
Loser

08:44.557 --> 08:46.057
UPLOADING...

09:57.196 --> 10:00.265
Mr.. Freeze.
You sent your form off yet?

10:00.766 --> 10:04.936
Don't worry, you'll be alright.
Anyway, you're looking cool.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.610
What do you think you're doing?
Stop that!

10:11.612 --> 10:14.112
- Get off him!
- This one, this one.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.381
Bloody hell.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.651
- Tom, what's the matter with you?
- Book him, Lou.

10:19.785 --> 10:20.986
Lunatic.

10:51.751 --> 10:54.819
HOPE FOR CHILDREN CHARITY CONCERT

11:15.274 --> 11:17.709
Tom's very quiet today.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.844
- We're both...
- ...exhausted.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.280
Poor old Mary's got a new
neighbour from hell apparently.

11:22.282 --> 11:26.151
- And Tom...
- ...is fighting at school, getting into trouble.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.186
Do you want me to
have a word with him?

11:28.188 --> 11:32.857
Why not? I'm sure he's got a few
sentences that need finishing.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.230
Tom.

11:45.471 --> 11:48.206
You don't just attack
someone for no reason.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.876
- If I was schizophrenic I might.
- Schizophrenics hear voices.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.245
I hear music. Does that count?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.715
I don't think that...

11:56.717 --> 11:59.217
- Do you defend schizophrenics?
- No.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.087
Just break up families, then.

12:02.488 --> 12:06.324
Isn't there some kind of law about
getting involved with your clients?

12:06.326 --> 12:09.728
- I'm not involved with your mother.
- You'd like to be, though.

12:09.730 --> 12:15.500
You've got 2 choices. Stop fighting.
Put in some work. Get into university.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.136
Or... be a sad loser.
Like your dad.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.847
That is appalling.
Have you spoken to the Council?

12:28.849 --> 12:31.316
They told me to
keep a noise diary.

12:42.895 --> 12:45.764
Your constant
racket is driving me crazy.

12:46.899 --> 12:49.901
- Why don't you let me?
- You're always doing this.

12:49.903 --> 12:53.037
- What?
- Speaking for me. Finishing my sentences.

12:53.039 --> 12:57.909
I am a perfectly functioning intelligent woman
quite capable of fighting my own battles.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.779
- But you asked me to.
- Yes, I know.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.115
Sorry, I'm just at the end of my...

13:04.884 --> 13:06.851
You are destroying my life.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.455
Is that marijuana?

13:15.127 --> 13:16.161
Mary!

13:19.131 --> 13:20.965
Rock 'n' roll.

13:23.903 --> 13:28.973
Why do people feel they can inflict their
life choices on everyone around them?

13:30.242 --> 13:33.144
Useless, selfish bloody...

13:35.314 --> 13:40.318
- You don't know anything about him.
- I had 9 years of it with your father.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.568
Thomas the tank.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.389
- How you going, buddy?
- Hi, Dad.

14:05.010 --> 14:08.413
You've got the best of my love

14:08.881 --> 14:12.350
But only on the weekend

14:15.287 --> 14:16.955
He's a great singer.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.924
- I'm a singer, in a band.
- Really?

14:20.459 --> 14:23.895
It's called Risk Factor.
Heard of us?

14:24.029 --> 14:25.230
- No.
- No.

14:25.232 --> 14:30.368
If you wanted to, just give me
your number then I could...

14:30.370 --> 14:34.372
...get you on
the guest list.V-I-P.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.910
Can I help you with anything?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.915
No.Just waiting for him.

14:44.483 --> 14:47.185
- Yeah, is that your son?
- No.

14:47.187 --> 14:50.488
No, no, no.
It's just something I do.

14:50.490 --> 14:54.058
I mentor special...
well difficult children.

14:55.027 --> 14:58.096
- Doesn't look difficult.
- He's actually on sedatives.

14:58.998 --> 15:00.064
Really?

15:00.232 --> 15:02.934
Yeah. I mean,
you wouldn't think it.

15:03.669 --> 15:07.071
He runs the most
dangerous gang in Sutton.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.941
Yes!

15:09.943 --> 15:11.943
It's okay. I got it.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.246
He gets excited.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.234
See? Fine.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.102
I'm fine.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.306
It's just for my peace of mind,
darling.

15:47.112 --> 15:51.482
Jonah's gonna write us a
letter. Move to get him evicted.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.987
Sleep well.

16:32.758 --> 16:37.161
Finish the questions. Look at the
text for tomorrow and no talking.

16:54.613 --> 16:57.181
Nothing Album Goes Double Platinum

16:59.518 --> 17:03.054
Max Stone held on drugs charges
Nothing tour on hold

17:10.162 --> 17:12.030
How very sad.

17:12.498 --> 17:14.766
Come on, class, gather round.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.537
Tom, get the page back.

17:20.806 --> 17:26.210
So, tomorrow, a thousand words
on uses for the compound silicon.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.413
Apart from breast implants.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.415
Mr.. Perv.

17:35.654 --> 17:38.222
I don't like myself

17:39.658 --> 17:41.759
Well, I'm a haunted soul

18:40.552 --> 18:43.187
What the hell do you want?

18:43.722 --> 18:48.192
Teach me. You got loads of time.
You're always here.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.881
MAX STONE MISSING.
MAX STONE SUICIDE?

19:15.420 --> 19:18.656
One Million Pound tax Fraud...
wanted in America and the UK.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.493
ROCKER'S SON DIES HIS OWN POOL

19:35.507 --> 19:39.243
I know about your dead boy.
Maybe teaching me...

19:40.212 --> 19:45.216
If you ever mention a dead child to me
again, that is exactly what you'll be.

19:54.226 --> 19:58.229
I'd rather be dead than not be
able to play the guitar like you!

21:38.297 --> 21:39.797
Teach me.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.300
The blue one.

21:42.567 --> 21:46.337
You teach me and you get to live
your secret life in peace.

21:47.072 --> 21:50.641
The red one and I'll tell
everyone that you're not dead.

21:52.077 --> 21:53.678
Think about it.

21:54.079 --> 21:57.448
I bet the tabloids
would love a story like this.

21:57.450 --> 22:01.319
"Crippled tax dodger living
under false identity."

22:01.321 --> 22:05.389
"Wacko saddo benefit... cheater."

22:06.792 --> 22:10.061
Sad little loner. No life.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.364
So are you.

22:14.366 --> 22:15.499
At least I had one.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.373
Mum's getting a solicitor,
so you'd better stop playing...

22:22.375 --> 22:24.656
...music all night and start
teaching me guitar...

22:25.010 --> 22:27.878
...or you'll be locked up.
Do you hear?

22:56.141 --> 23:01.412
Well I've been drinking
beer and whiskey all night

23:01.646 --> 23:05.716
I'll fall down, yeah

23:09.654 --> 23:14.558
Well I've been drinking
beer and whiskey all night

23:14.893 --> 23:17.428
I'll fall down, yeah

23:19.498 --> 23:21.065
Well

23:23.668 --> 23:27.738
When the sun does come babe

23:29.541 --> 23:31.976
I'm coming home

23:47.092 --> 23:49.427
He's stopped playing his music.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.996
I wonder why.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.849
Sounds great.

24:12.884 --> 24:14.518
Carry on.

24:17.889 --> 24:20.624
Okay, from the top.3, 4...

24:39.578 --> 24:41.145
Get a chair.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.695
Tune it.

25:08.773 --> 25:10.508
Go ahead, then.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.878
Can I go in the other room?

25:27.692 --> 25:29.527
What shall I play?

25:29.529 --> 25:30.895
Anything.

25:57.822 --> 26:01.725
- Why do you wanna play like me?
- Because you're brilliant.

26:01.727 --> 26:05.095
You were voted
Rock Guitars' guitarist of 1993.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.264
Yeah, was I?

26:07.666 --> 26:10.334
How could you
forget something like that?

26:10.336 --> 26:15.739
Listen, if I play like me and
people like it, that's one thing.

26:15.741 --> 26:19.009
You play like me,
it's a tribute band.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.579
- But I just wanna...
- No.

26:21.581 --> 26:26.584
No more about me. I don't wanna
ever hear another word about me.

26:26.586 --> 26:31.589
No history about me.
No facts about me. You just play.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.113
It's good.

27:04.222 --> 27:05.289
Yeah.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.168
Just... just leave it.

27:31.416 --> 27:32.650
Thanks.

27:41.259 --> 27:44.662
Leave me alone
I just wanna hang with my friends

27:46.765 --> 27:50.067
Dirty pretty thing
She's been chatting since ten

27:51.670 --> 27:56.840
I don't wanna have a fight with
you So think it all over, have a drink or two

27:56.842 --> 28:01.345
I said, leave me alone I just

28:02.714 --> 28:05.683
Help me out
She's driving me round the bend

28:09.821 --> 28:12.189
Tom, Tom, Tom. Come on.

28:12.824 --> 28:15.092
- How you doing, buddy?
- Not bad, Dad.

28:15.827 --> 28:18.429
Good, good. Got any cash?

28:24.035 --> 28:26.470
Whoa. You dealing drugs?

28:26.472 --> 28:27.738
No.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.873
Running an extortion racket?

28:29.875 --> 28:33.844
Auntie's been giving me £30 every
Christmas and birthday since 2008.

28:33.846 --> 28:37.715
And my paper round's between 7 and 9 pounds,
depending how many flyers they put in.

28:37.717 --> 28:43.854
And they gave me my jumperback
last Christmas which I kept the money for.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.857
Good because
I'm not an extortionist.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.225
No, you're not.

28:48.227 --> 28:52.830
You look fantastic in your glasses.
Your mum has excelled herself.

28:57.001 --> 29:01.405
I came out to have a drink or two
So just think about it, I'm not fighting with you

29:01.407 --> 29:04.742
I said, leave me alone I just
wanna hang with my friends

29:04.744 --> 29:08.011
- What's the hurry?
- Late for rehearsal. Battle of the Bands.

29:08.013 --> 29:11.415
- You're in a band?
- I sing. Play guitar.

29:13.518 --> 29:17.187
I am so gonna get
an exclusion order on you.

29:17.189 --> 29:20.791
Yeah, stay away from me. Pervert!

29:23.762 --> 29:26.096
My dad's getting
me a new guitar.

29:26.364 --> 29:30.200
Great. Why don't you get him to
teach you how to play it?

29:30.202 --> 29:32.870
He would but he's
too busy at the mo.

29:33.404 --> 29:36.006
- Right.
- I've written a new riff.

29:36.207 --> 29:40.811
Ah, well... why don't you go in
your studio here and play it.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.835
Invert it.

30:06.437 --> 30:08.305
Play it somewhere else.

30:09.274 --> 30:11.375
No, on the guitar.

30:12.443 --> 30:13.477
Oh.

30:20.418 --> 30:22.152
Play the chord.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.526
Give me a 'D' two frets up.

30:37.602 --> 30:40.938
Now back to the 'E', on the 12th.

30:47.278 --> 30:49.880
It's like the same chord further up.

30:49.882 --> 30:50.882
Inversion.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.811
Can you still do that with the ...?

30:56.287 --> 31:00.891
Don't worry about my hand.
Just keep playing.

31:26.017 --> 31:28.919
In front of an audience.
Well done.

31:30.355 --> 31:32.556
Thanks. Can I leave it here?

31:32.558 --> 31:34.391
No, just take it.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.225
I can't.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.629
- Why not?
- My mum doesn't know I've got it.

31:39.497 --> 31:43.567
- Where do you keep it?
- In the air vent. On the roof.

31:44.535 --> 31:45.936
Why?

31:45.938 --> 31:51.074
Dad's in a band and mum hates
everything he stands for.

31:52.176 --> 31:55.078
She'd go mental if she found out
I was doing music.

31:55.947 --> 32:00.918
She wants me to be a solicitor
or something like her stupid friends.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.387
Yeah, that's real interesting.

32:03.389 --> 32:08.025
Not the solicitor part,
of course, but the secrets.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.960
You got secrets.

32:10.962 --> 32:15.933
So the way I see it, we have us
a blackmail Mexican stand-off.

32:16.567 --> 32:19.670
You try to ruin my life,
I will ruin yours.

32:20.371 --> 32:23.106
I like that.
It's a balance of power.

32:23.708 --> 32:28.445
Takes us back to the way we were before.
We can just go on ignoring each other.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.514
Yeah, but it's not balanced.

32:31.215 --> 32:33.717
I'll tell everyone
that you're Max Stone.

32:33.719 --> 32:37.020
Yeah, and I will tell your mum
about the Devil's music.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.624
Well, I'll tell everyone
you tried to touch me.

32:44.062 --> 32:46.530
Someone help, it's a pedo!

32:50.568 --> 32:52.469
Pedo, retard.

32:53.271 --> 32:55.038
Stefan Pavlovski.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.978
Stefan Pavlovski?

33:06.985 --> 33:09.653
Smoking helps with the pain.

33:09.655 --> 33:13.023
You're not even supposed to
smoke cigarettes out there.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.127
Would you tuck yourself in.

33:17.129 --> 33:20.330
Oh, yeah. Sorry, nurse.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.499
Don't call me that.

33:24.335 --> 33:27.504
- You haven't done your exercises, have you?
- No.

33:27.506 --> 33:32.509
- Why do you bother coming?
- If I don't they cut off my disability benefit.

33:45.156 --> 33:48.125
- Okay, let's leave it there.
- Yes.

33:54.198 --> 33:58.035
I'm seeing my dad tomorrow.
By next lesson I'll have a proper axe.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.307
- Leave me alone.
- Tom.

35:13.544 --> 35:14.544
Tom.

35:31.629 --> 35:36.433
Well it rained all night and
it's cold all day

35:36.435 --> 35:40.470
I can't carry the weight,
think I might die

35:41.239 --> 35:46.276
The cupboard's empty again
Oh my belly cries out

35:46.278 --> 35:50.213
I'm so hungry that
I think I might die

36:04.462 --> 36:06.329
What's going on in here?

36:08.933 --> 36:12.169
It's, it's Tom's dad.

36:12.837 --> 36:17.707
- What happened to him?
- He's run away to Spain with some girl.

36:19.944 --> 36:23.513
Not a word. He didn't
even say goodbye to Tom.

36:26.350 --> 36:30.253
Tom. Don't throw anything,
I'm coming in.

36:36.627 --> 36:39.930
I've wrecked a few rooms in my day.
It's good work.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.701
He took my money.

36:47.238 --> 36:50.240
You're gonna have to get used to
that in this business.

36:52.810 --> 36:55.212
So you think I can do it?

36:55.680 --> 36:58.215
Got a few things
working against you.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.250
Like?

37:03.654 --> 37:09.392
Crippling shyness that renders you incapable
of playing in front of anyone except me.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.261
Right, apart from that.

37:11.829 --> 37:14.231
You've gotta find
your own voice.

37:15.366 --> 37:19.236
Every great guitar
player has a unique voice.

37:19.238 --> 37:21.838
Clapton, Hendrix, Johnson.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.740
Who's Johnson?

37:24.508 --> 37:26.743
Robert Leroy Johnson.

37:30.381 --> 37:34.517
Story goes that when he first
started playing guitar...

37:34.519 --> 37:38.655
...he was so bad people
laughed. He was embarrassed.

37:39.257 --> 37:42.425
So one night
he goes to a crossroads.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.329
Clarksdale,
Mississippi.Midnight.

37:47.298 --> 37:49.599
Sells his soul to the Devil.

37:51.435 --> 37:55.839
After that he was the greatest
Blues guitarist the world had ever seen.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.443
So like you but
the other way round.

38:01.412 --> 38:05.382
Get it? Because you were good
then you sold your soul and now...

38:05.384 --> 38:07.017
Yeah, I get it.

38:07.019 --> 38:13.056
Now someday you may have minions that will
take care of all this but until then...

38:13.058 --> 38:17.060
...I suggest that you
apologise to the management.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.962
Start cleaning this up.

38:34.578 --> 38:37.981
You look like a weirdo.
Like you're gonna start screaming.

38:37.983 --> 38:42.585
- Yeah, well, I just might.
- Famous like 100 years ago.

38:42.587 --> 38:44.621
You recognised me.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.890
That's because
I'm knowledgeable.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.493
I forgot, you're a regular
little idiot savant.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.801
- What happened to all your cash?
- What?

38:57.803 --> 39:00.337
Don't you get
royalties and stuff?

39:02.106 --> 39:03.840
I lost it all.

39:04.475 --> 39:08.511
- You must have had such a good time.
- I sure hope so.

39:08.946 --> 39:13.883
I don't remember any of the good parts.
I don't remember a damn thing.

39:31.702 --> 39:36.406
- What can I do for you gents?
- Need a budget amp.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.376
6 pack of those
electra sound lights.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.947
You been in here before?

39:45.015 --> 39:46.015
No?

39:50.688 --> 39:53.690
I call this one Sharon
after my ex-girlfriend.

39:53.692 --> 39:57.494
Cheap, easy to pick up
and it packs a right punch.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.096
Whatever. How much does it cost?

40:00.998 --> 40:04.801
Say 30 for the amp.4 for the strings.
Let's call it 35?

40:06.737 --> 40:09.739
Max Stone, that's who you look like.
From Nothing.

40:10.841 --> 40:14.477
Sore point. He got fired
from their tribute band.

40:15.179 --> 40:18.548
Yeah, I know there
was all that nonsense but...

40:18.550 --> 40:21.151
...people forget how
good he actually was.

40:31.862 --> 40:34.864
Rock Guitars' guitarist of 1993.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.834
That guy's dead.
Wanna keep it that way.

40:46.544 --> 40:49.446
I'd do it.
I'd sell my soul.

40:57.621 --> 41:00.123
Sometimes the Devil cheats.

41:19.743 --> 41:21.544
You'll get the hang of it.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.513
Show me.

41:24.615 --> 41:26.049
Can't do it.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.688
Don't play anything
you don't feel.

41:54.011 --> 41:58.848
The Devil cheated me
Took me for a ride

42:01.685 --> 42:07.557
Packed me in his limousine
Drove me to the other side

42:09.994 --> 42:14.697
The Devil cheated me
What a hell of a ride

42:17.968 --> 42:22.038
He showed me good times
He showed me fun

42:22.040 --> 42:25.708
He said "You can
have all of this, son

42:26.143 --> 42:29.646
All for nothing
All for free

42:29.648 --> 42:34.050
Just sign your name on this
dotted line for me"

42:38.055 --> 42:41.824
The Devil cheated me
Took me for a ride

42:41.826 --> 42:44.093
Calculating your route.

42:45.563 --> 42:50.600
Stuffed me in his limousine
Chauffeured me to the darker side

42:54.038 --> 42:58.908
I lost my soul
But what a hell of a ride

43:18.195 --> 43:22.098
He showed me wild times
Wine, women and song

43:22.100 --> 43:26.069
He said "Son,
this is where you belong

43:26.071 --> 43:29.639
All your desires
All your needs

43:30.040 --> 43:34.010
Will be fulfilled, so c'mon,
sign these deeds"

43:38.082 --> 43:40.650
The Devil cheated me

43:42.119 --> 43:44.387
The Devil cheated me

43:44.389 --> 43:46.389
Perform a U-turn immediately.

43:46.391 --> 43:48.291
The Devil cheated me

43:49.893 --> 43:52.395
The Devil cheated me

43:52.397 --> 43:54.077
- Danger.
- END OF ROAD

43:54.231 --> 43:55.732
Danger.

43:59.903 --> 44:02.205
You've reached your destination.

44:07.277 --> 44:11.080
Hello, Mr.. Angry.
How's it going with your band?

44:11.082 --> 44:13.750
I'm just working
on some new material.

44:13.752 --> 44:15.985
I'd love to hear it sometime.

44:20.658 --> 44:21.991
See you around.

44:56.460 --> 44:59.762
- Steve?
- Yeah. Just a minute.

45:11.475 --> 45:12.442
Hi.

45:12.444 --> 45:18.715
I just came by to say
thank you for the other day.

45:20.317 --> 45:24.954
- Is this a bad time?
- Yeah, it is, actually. I was just...

45:26.390 --> 45:28.391
Smashing some crockery.

45:28.992 --> 45:30.760
Well, yeah.

45:31.161 --> 45:33.496
Well, I can clear it up for you.

45:33.498 --> 45:37.400
No! Don't.It's... Just go.

45:40.904 --> 45:43.906
But come back later. You and Tom.

45:45.175 --> 45:47.777
Yeah.
You should come back for dinner.

45:49.046 --> 45:50.413
Really?

45:51.048 --> 45:52.081
Okay.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.017
I can bring the food.

45:55.019 --> 45:57.420
Great. And plates.

45:57.921 --> 45:59.055
Okay.

45:59.057 --> 46:01.424
Knives and forks.

46:01.426 --> 46:02.458
Sure.

46:03.060 --> 46:05.094
You want a couple of chairs.

46:05.096 --> 46:08.131
- Why don't you just come up here?
- Okay.

46:13.537 --> 46:17.874
Nice work. You don't actually
wanna have dinner with her, do you?

46:17.876 --> 46:21.844
No.No.You were in
here with the guitar... Go.

46:36.059 --> 46:41.197
For what we are about to receive
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

46:43.801 --> 46:47.503
I don't think I've ever heard
anyone say that in real life.

46:52.943 --> 46:54.310
Is this alright for you?

46:56.947 --> 46:58.514
Yeah.I...

47:06.156 --> 47:07.824
It's chewy.

47:11.295 --> 47:15.331
I feel like I'm burning
energy just chewing it.

47:18.101 --> 47:21.871
It must be better than all those
ready meals for one.

47:25.976 --> 47:27.936
...it's nice to be sitting here...

47:29.847 --> 47:31.347
...together, eating.

47:32.449 --> 47:34.917
We don't usually do this.

47:35.452 --> 47:37.854
I tried when you were younger.

47:39.122 --> 47:42.024
But your dad was
always out late, so...

47:43.126 --> 47:44.927
...it didn't really happen.

47:51.034 --> 47:54.403
Perhaps I'm sometimes a bit too
quick to judge people.

47:56.039 --> 47:59.876
I think he's lonely down there.
Just needs a bit of love.

47:59.878 --> 48:02.912
- Mum!
- God's love.

49:09.246 --> 49:10.279
Hi.

49:11.114 --> 49:13.115
She wants to make you walk.

49:13.117 --> 49:15.117
I just wondered...

49:16.553 --> 49:19.021
- ...if you'd like to...
- No, no, no.

49:23.460 --> 49:24.493
Wasp.

49:27.130 --> 49:30.700
...come out for a coffee...
if you've nothing better to do.

49:32.469 --> 49:33.636
No.

49:36.273 --> 49:39.141
No, no, I've
nothing better to do.

49:46.083 --> 49:50.720
The thing about wasps, sometimes when you
wave at them they just get more stubborn.

49:53.323 --> 49:58.027
- I hope this wasn't too far.
- No, I need to walk more.

50:04.134 --> 50:06.068
I did try to warn you.

50:29.159 --> 50:32.461
Fantastic.
That's, that's really come on.

50:32.463 --> 50:35.698
Gemma, I think we're gonna lose your pum-pums.
They're not really working, are they?

50:35.700 --> 50:37.633
I thought they
were sounding okay.

50:37.635 --> 50:39.035
I didn't.

50:39.037 --> 50:42.638
- What do you think?
- It's unique...

50:42.640 --> 50:45.041
...and I love Gemma's pum-pums.

50:45.342 --> 50:49.478
Might you be joining us?
The male section could do with beefing up.

50:49.480 --> 50:52.715
This is Steve.
He's moved in below us.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.551
The neighbour from hell.

50:56.186 --> 50:58.154
Can I have a quick word, please?

51:04.561 --> 51:08.230
- Why have you brought him here?
- Because...

51:08.232 --> 51:12.735
...he's new to the area and he
doesn't seem to have any friends.

51:13.503 --> 51:18.407
- Just be careful, okay?
- Look, I know you mean well but just...

51:20.077 --> 51:22.578
So, are you gonna
come to our charity gig?

51:23.113 --> 51:27.083
Yeah, definitely. I'll be there
in the mosh pit, going for it.

51:28.218 --> 51:29.585
Alright.

51:31.088 --> 51:34.256
Goodbye, ladies.
You have a nice evening.

51:36.560 --> 51:38.427
Bye, Steve.

51:41.198 --> 51:42.198
Lovely.

51:46.103 --> 51:50.473
- I don't think Jonah likes me very much.
- He's just jealous.

51:53.210 --> 51:54.276
Tom.

51:54.278 --> 51:58.614
Are you coming to school next
week or are you being a bad boy again?

51:58.616 --> 52:01.150
- No, I'll be there.
- Cool.

52:01.384 --> 52:02.618
See you there.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.455
Oh, why didn't you introduce me?

52:06.457 --> 52:09.125
It's like being in a
Jane Austen novel.

52:09.127 --> 52:11.627
Youth is wasted on the young.

52:12.295 --> 52:14.630
I bet it wasn't wasted on you.

52:24.407 --> 52:26.742
Why is it so dark in here?

52:26.744 --> 52:30.312
Well, yeah,
because I have a headache.

52:31.748 --> 52:34.650
- What's going on with you and that girl?
- Nothing.

52:35.485 --> 52:41.590
I see. She is kind of cute and
she does seem into you.

52:41.592 --> 52:44.160
- You don't think it's like you and my mum?
- How's that?

52:44.494 --> 52:48.531
They both just feel sorry for us.
You should play on it.

52:50.300 --> 52:55.304
She trusts you. You could take me
to the Battle of the Bands next weekend.

52:55.306 --> 53:00.509
If you're gonna play that thing,
you're gonna have to do it in front of an audience.

53:03.847 --> 53:05.714
An audience...

53:06.349 --> 53:08.751
...is a multi-headed monster...

53:10.520 --> 53:15.224
...with a thousand sharp fangs
ready to stab you in any second.

53:17.961 --> 53:20.696
But you are
gonna tame the beast.

53:21.798 --> 53:24.300
You're gonna make it love you.

53:24.302 --> 53:29.238
Alright, we're on the main stage,
it's Saturday night, in Reading.

53:29.839 --> 53:33.809
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
the moment you've all been waiting for.

53:33.811 --> 53:37.646
Multiple Grammy
winning platinum award selling...

53:37.648 --> 53:41.250
...artist of the year, Tom.

54:15.585 --> 54:19.388
He had a dream
A path to the stars

54:19.390 --> 54:22.925
A promised land
Writing songs

54:22.927 --> 54:28.530
Living the dream And knocking
down walls with his guitar

54:28.532 --> 54:31.267
Writing songs of freedom

54:31.269 --> 54:35.437
Melodies dreaming wherever you are

54:36.406 --> 54:38.274
Hearing songs for freedom

54:38.276 --> 54:43.045
Melodies streaming like a rising star

54:43.047 --> 54:44.780
Glistening

54:51.054 --> 54:53.422
High above

54:53.424 --> 54:58.961
And I'm rising
sky above Moon rising

55:04.734 --> 55:08.470
He had a dream
It seemed to be real

55:08.472 --> 55:11.940
Telling the world
Writing songs

55:11.942 --> 55:15.644
City of stone and promise of hope

55:15.646 --> 55:18.480
Close to gold
Then he woke

55:25.789 --> 55:28.324
High above

55:28.326 --> 55:33.329
And I'm rising sky above Moon rising

55:38.668 --> 55:43.372
Don't wake me up

55:45.775 --> 55:50.512
Don't wake me up

55:53.116 --> 55:56.785
Don't wake me up

55:56.787 --> 56:00.489
Making my way to
the promised land

56:00.491 --> 56:04.126
Don't wake me up

56:04.128 --> 56:07.563
Making my way to
the promised land

56:07.964 --> 56:11.367
Don't wake me up

56:11.369 --> 56:14.870
Making my way to
the promised land

56:14.872 --> 56:18.540
Don't wake me up

56:18.542 --> 56:22.411
Making my way to
the promised land

56:27.150 --> 56:30.486
You just played
a sold out arena.

56:30.488 --> 56:35.524
Now this gig next weekend's
gonna be a walk in the park. Now get going.

56:35.526 --> 56:37.059
Leave the guitar.

56:44.834 --> 56:45.901
I...

56:46.536 --> 56:48.504
...I got you something.

56:49.005 --> 56:52.574
It's a bit silly but
I thought it might...

56:54.177 --> 56:55.744
...you know...

56:57.547 --> 57:01.450
- What is that?
- It's electronic. Helps you cut down...

57:01.452 --> 57:02.951
...if you want to.

57:06.523 --> 57:08.557
That's not too bad.

57:08.559 --> 57:11.794
- Wanna try?
- I haven't smoked in years.

57:12.028 --> 57:13.929
My teenage rebellion.

57:14.731 --> 57:19.001
The thrill of keeping something
secret from your boring parents.

57:19.702 --> 57:23.205
Yeah, but now you're the boring
parent with a teenager.

57:23.207 --> 57:28.644
Sometimes my passwords get
thrown right back at me.

57:29.045 --> 57:30.045
Yeah.

57:31.748 --> 57:33.615
Have you got children?

57:35.919 --> 57:37.519
A son.

57:38.888 --> 57:40.956
I had a son.

57:42.125 --> 57:43.826
He died.

57:47.597 --> 57:49.565
Oh, Steve, I'm so sorry.

57:53.570 --> 57:56.505
If you don't
want to talk about it...

57:56.906 --> 57:58.707
You should know.

58:00.743 --> 58:04.680
He drowned in my pool because
I wasn't looking after him.

58:05.148 --> 58:07.850
He was 3 years old.

58:09.586 --> 58:12.521
3 years, 10 months, 7 days and...

58:16.593 --> 58:18.994
I should have been watching.

58:20.129 --> 58:22.998
The really horrible
part of it is that...

58:23.933 --> 58:27.836
...you know, whenever
I... I think of him, I...

58:28.771 --> 58:30.739
...I hate myself, so...

58:35.111 --> 58:37.746
...I try not to
think about him.

58:56.699 --> 58:58.867
So, she trusts you?

58:59.669 --> 59:01.837
I don't know.
You'd have to ask her.

59:01.839 --> 59:06.008
You have to take me to this
battle next week. But she can't know.

59:06.010 --> 59:10.045
- I'm not gonna lie to her, Tom.
- Your whole life is a lie.

59:10.980 --> 59:14.082
- Yeah, I like her.
- She's my mum.

59:17.720 --> 59:19.755
She hates the music.

59:22.659 --> 59:28.230
Then we will just have to find some way
to make her realise that the music...

59:29.032 --> 59:32.634
...it's not as bad as some of the other
stuff you've been doing to yourself.

59:37.674 --> 59:39.074
Let's just play.

59:39.709 --> 59:41.076
Go ahead.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.163
This is good.

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:38.634
Really, really good.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.361
Can you record on this?

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:15.704
I can't hide

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:19.341
I've been running all my life

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:22.944
With each disguise

01:01:22.946 --> 01:01:26.715
A little piece of us dies

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:29.851
We can't hide

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:33.722
From the truth that's inside

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:36.925
All our lives

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.195
Trapped and denied

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.369
Prisoner

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:53.408
Prisoner

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.390
That sounded...

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:10.959
...great.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.831
That is the track.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.968
Rock 'n' roll, baby!

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.853
How dare you!

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:41.256
I know this looks bad but you
need to take a step back.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:44.092
Step back?!
You gave my son drugs.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.429
- He took it.
- He is completely out of it.

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:51.199
He could have fallen off the roof.
What were doing up there?

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:54.102
I teach him guitar.
He's a musician.

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:57.205
It's...
that's all he cares about.

01:02:57.207 --> 01:02:59.941
He can't even sing in
the church choir!

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.512
He can sing. He can play.

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:09.084
- Writes his own music.
- I don't care. He is not going down that path.

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:13.522
You can't treat him like a child forever.
He's a teenager.

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:19.928
You are in no position to talk
to me about raising children!

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.830
Now just stay away from Tom!

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.833
And stay away from me!

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:42.377
Your Mum is right. I'm not the sort of
person you should be hanging out with.

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:31.459
What are you listening to?

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:35.263
Are you okay, Tom?

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:41.436
I can't play music any more.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:47.976
The guy who was teaching me.
He's gone.

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:51.146
- You can find someone else.
- Not like him.

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:54.950
Is that the guy
I saw you with in the park?

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:57.619
I thought that was your dad.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.188
He used to be famous.

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:02.490
He did look kind of cool.

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:05.293
You ever hear of
a band called Nothing?

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:11.066
A huge US band in the nineties.
Kind of thrash/grunge.

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:14.135
- Is that a video?
- Yeah.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:17.706
- Let's see it, then?
- It's very rough.

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:36.324
You and the movie guy.
You two rock.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:41.529
- I'm sending myself your song.
- You can't show that to anyone.

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:43.565
Why not?

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:47.068
Just promise me.

01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:01.349
They're old.

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:04.052
I'm fine now.

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:08.023
So, how do you stop yourself?

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.360
Play guitar.

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.431
Join our band.

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:21.202
We need a decent songwriter.
It'll be nice to have you around.

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:26.541
Don't look so shocked.

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.643
Extra Latin?

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:30.311
After school.

01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:33.248
It's useful for law.
Jonah told me.

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:40.221
And I've been thinking, maybe I could help
out in the choir. If you think I'm up to it.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.390
Tom-kins, I'm sure you are.

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:44.726
I did like Steve.

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:46.094
Yeah.

01:07:46.096 --> 01:07:50.098
I liked him a lot but
I'm back on track now.

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.768
And... we're okay, aren't we?

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:57.572
Course we are, Mum.

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:23.631
- How about I play that the second time round?
- That's cool. How did you do that?

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:27.102
It's called a higher inversion.
He taught me.

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:29.170
You're really good.

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:42.149
Oi, oi, lovebirds. Break it up.

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:48.490
Mr.. Freeze. What you doing today?
Just chilling out?

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:52.193
Chilling out because...
Mr... Freeze.

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:57.532
Tom's got some good ideas.
We do need help with our song.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.835
You got a sick guitar there,
mate.

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:03.138
Not a copy either.

01:09:03.738 --> 01:09:06.241
Tell me, how does a boy like you...

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:10.178
...come to possess
a guitar like that?

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:18.520
Go on then, take it away.
Show us what you got.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.660
Sooner rather than later.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:43.278
It's a bit girlie, isn't it?

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.515
Want something, you know,
something that rocks.

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:50.350
Like that.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.854
Now in your own time.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:03.364
- He can't hack it, can he?
- Tom, wait.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.733
- You can't hack it.
- Sorry.

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:12.340
The first time I sang with them
I had to get in a wardrobe.

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:15.877
And the door was shut.
And I'm scared of the dark.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:18.313
- That's ridiculous.
- Why?

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.348
Because you're so...

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:25.520
- I just can't.
- Tom, wait.

01:10:25.522 --> 01:10:26.754
Felix.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.406
It's dark in here

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:49.677
Escape from the
zombies living in fear

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:52.747
Girl so lonely

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:56.284
Girl so lonely

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:05.426
With opened eyes

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:09.264
Woke up in a world that's
bright outside

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:11.966
Girl broke free

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:14.936
Girl broke free

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:30.285
Girl in the wardrobe

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.620
Out of the darkness

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:36.758
Girl in the wardrobe

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.760
She stepped right out

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:43.398
Girl in the wardrobe

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.566
And into the light

01:11:45.568 --> 01:11:49.904
Girl in the wardrobe

01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:51.806
She stepped right out

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:57.378
Girl in the wardrobe

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:03.484
Girl in the wardrobe

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:10.391
Girl in the wardrobe

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:22.537
Damien.

01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:27.442
Next time you have a crush,
don't invite him to join the band, alright?

01:12:27.444 --> 01:12:32.480
Listen, you moron. He's got more
soul and talent than you'll ever have.

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:36.617
I think you're right, mate.
I think she does have a thing for him.

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:38.886
And he's a better songwriter.

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:45.026
I can't hide

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:48.796
I've been running all my life

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:52.133
And each disguise

01:12:52.135 --> 01:12:54.369
- Who's that?
- His teacher.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.708
He just needs to
build his confidence.

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:05.546
I think we can help him do that.

01:13:06.982 --> 01:13:09.050
Trapped and denied

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.798
I can't hide

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:26.067
What are you doing?

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:32.540
I'm practising for the song
that's gonna win me Battle of the Bands.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:33.741
Here you go, look.

01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:37.812
Tambourine for you there.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:40.515
See how you fare with that.

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:43.684
I'll tell the judges.
You'll get disqualified.

01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:45.420
And why's that?

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:47.755
It's my song.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:54.562
Not just your song. I've been
doing a little reading about your friend.

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:58.499
Yeah, massive tax fraud, jumped bail,
owes a lot of people a lot of money.

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:04.105
I don't blame him if he wanted
to disappear, that's fine, but...

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:07.875
...you know as well as I do
that if that video gets out it's bad news.

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:11.612
So tell the judges, and
I'll go straight to the police.

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:09.036
No ...!

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.598
I've done a stupid thing.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.768
I showed Felix the video.

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:52.640
I was just
trying to impress her.

01:16:56.712 --> 01:17:00.781
Somebody with half your talent
could start a career with this thing.

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.819
What's the point?

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:09.290
All the success in the
world and you lose your soul.

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:16.297
You are gonna be great.
You can do this gig.

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:19.634
- You're gonna do it solo.
- I can't.

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:24.305
You can.Hey...

01:17:27.242 --> 01:17:29.644
...we gotta stop hiding, Tom.

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:42.156
So, I hope
you can figure it out.

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:43.858
What is it?

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:46.060
You'll see.

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:53.768
Fine young capulet flawless and
just immaculate

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:56.804
Face like a magnet but wishes
she was more accurate

01:17:56.806 --> 01:17:59.940
Drags on a cigarette
Exhales but can't forget

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:03.010
Reconciled and desperate to do
something that she might regret

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:06.013
Knows she's getting closer and
ready to talk to most of 'em

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:09.116
Looks in and out but all she can
see is the ghost of him

01:18:09.118 --> 01:18:12.319
Knows she's getting closer
He won't believe a word she says

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:14.955
He's getting closer
She knows he's getting closer

01:18:14.957 --> 01:18:17.992
And don't try to tell me not to
get in a fight

01:18:17.994 --> 01:18:19.960
And don't try to kid yourself
the boys are alright

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:22.129
- You with a band?
- No, it's just me.

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:23.698
Too late, mate.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.367
- Please, you have to let me.
- No, I don't.

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:30.738
You wanna be like the guy who turned
down The Beatles? I'm good. Trust me.

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:33.474
But it's all alright
It's all gonna be alright

01:18:33.476 --> 01:18:39.113
She tries so hard to convince herself
but in her heart of hearts she knows

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:44.852
Tom?

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.994
How did you get in?
Where's Tom?

01:18:53.996 --> 01:18:57.398
Look, Tom's fine.
I think you need to see this.

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:18.252
In a flash gone
the world's moved on

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:24.992
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing my song.

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:29.830
That's hilarious, mate.
I can't wait. It's gonna be great.

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:32.933
You realise you can't
even look at an audience.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:36.103
You're gonna look like a bit of
a tit up there, aren't you?

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.974
You're in for a shock, mate.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.110
Let's hear it for Jazz Blaack.

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:48.282
Okay. Next up tonight,
our only solo artist.

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:51.819
Let's hear it for
singer/songwriter Tom Heath.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.341
Song's called 'The Prisoner'.

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:59.987
We can't hide

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:03.357
We've been running all our lives

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:06.227
With each disguise

01:21:06.995 --> 01:21:10.531
A little piece of us dies

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:13.033
We can't hide

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:17.371
From the truth that's inside

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:20.207
All our lives

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:23.577
Trapped and denied

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:28.449
Prisoner

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:36.056
Prisoner

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:42.029
Time has come

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:44.899
Have to find the key

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.402
We need someone

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:51.105
Someone to set us free

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:55.242
Yes the time has come

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:58.913
To take a helping hand

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:02.249
Release the past

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:06.086
And make a new stand

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:25.439
We are free

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:32.279
We are free

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:38.686
We are free

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:45.359
We are free

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:53.300
We are free

01:22:55.570 --> 01:23:00.307
We are free

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:02.403
There's gotta be
another way out.

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:04.271
Steve?

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:08.075
I'm down here.

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:10.577
- No.
- Get up.

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:13.247
No, Tom! No!

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.051
No.

01:24:17.053 --> 01:24:19.086
They'll put you in prison.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:24.091
The only prison is the one
you make for yourself. I'm not...

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:26.560
...I'm not running any more.

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:41.075
This his?

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.819
You have to help me let go.

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:19.580
The former Nothing guitarist,
Max Stone...

01:25:19.582 --> 01:25:23.717

Battle of the Bands in South London...

01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:27.454
...has been sentenced to
3 years in prison for tax fraud.

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:44.805
Don't wake me up

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:50.844
Don't wake me up

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:58.318
Don't wake me up

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:05.159
Don't wake me up

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:11.698
Don't wake me up

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:18.338
Don't wake me up

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:24.845
Don't wake me up

01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:31.185
Don't wake me up

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:35.956
Don't wake me up

01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:39.927
Phone Video goes viral.
Stone gives money to children's charity.

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.703
Are you ready for this?

01:26:52.974 --> 01:26:55.242
I can't hear you.

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:04.284
Are you ready for this?

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:20.934
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment
we've been waiting for.

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:24.771
It's Max Stone...

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:29.276
...and Tom Heath!
