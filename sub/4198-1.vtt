<i>I might be wrong but I might be right
Anyhow, I know I tried</i>

00:35.063 --> 00:38.507
<i>I better leave, I better leave
I better stop</i>

00:40.363 --> 00:42.568
<i>I like her taste when it fills my soul</i>

00:42.730 --> 00:46.106
<i>I'll tell you something
I've never told anyone</i>

00:46.264 --> 00:48.868
<i>Not anyone, not anyone</i>

00:50.598 --> 00:52.507
<i>Everyone's got a bleeding heart</i>

00:52.664 --> 00:55.074
<i>I don't know where
Or when to start</i>

00:55.232 --> 00:58.574
<i>I better bleed, I better bleed
I better stop</i>

00:59.699 --> 01:04.269
<i>Silly boys, you ran away</i>

01:04.433 --> 01:08.571
<i>You're unemployed
You'd waste away</i>

01:09.433 --> 01:13.775
<i>Silly boys, you ran away</i>

01:13.933 --> 01:18.241
<i>You're unemployed
You'd waste away</i>

01:19.400 --> 01:23.867
<i>Silly boys, you run away too far</i>

01:24.034 --> 01:27.740
<i>Remember this
Remember where you are</i>

01:35.569 --> 01:36.603
What the fuck?

01:36.769 --> 01:40.804
<i>Life is good, it's what I see
That makes me wanna disagree</i>

01:40.970 --> 01:44.540
<i>I better leave, I better leave

01:46.070 --> 01:49.674

01:53.471 --> 01:55.745
<i>If you lose your way
You just follow mine</i>

01:55.905 --> 01:59.475
<i>I better leave, I better leave
I better stop</i>

02:01.506 --> 02:03.950
And I'll still be in love with you.

02:04.572 --> 02:06.811
It's that way that you, uh...

02:07.506 --> 02:09.780
It's the way that you...

02:10.673 --> 02:13.310
Wait, shit.
Come on, Dave, what is it?

02:13.473 --> 02:16.383
That, uh... That amazing...
It's that amazing way that...

02:16.540 --> 02:18.609
Who are you talking to?
Oh! Jesus.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.207
You scared the crap out of me.
Sony.

02:23.374 --> 02:26.114
No, it's all right.
I just... Um, I thought I was alone.

02:26.275 --> 02:29.310
So you were talking to no one?
No.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.279
You go to Humphrey?
Yeah. Westerberg?

02:32.442 --> 02:34.579
North.
Do you know whose party this is?

02:34.742 --> 02:37.414
No, not a clue. What about you?
No, I don't know.

02:37.576 --> 02:41.520
I got brought by some friends.
Not even friends, really, just these girls.

02:41.676 --> 02:43.984
They might be whores.
Or at least whorish.

02:44.144 --> 02:46.951
The guys I hang outwith,
we drive around all night

02:47.110 --> 02:49.645
calling everyone we know,
just looking for some party.

02:49.811 --> 02:50.845
I mean, any party...

02:51.011 --> 02:54.750
We'll finally find one, and we'll get here
and we won't know anybody

02:54.911 --> 02:57.515
so we just stand around
and eventually just leave,

02:57.678 --> 02:59.451
go look for some other party.

02:59.612 --> 03:02.681
That's silly. Why do you do it?
What else are you gonna do, right?

03:05.479 --> 03:07.718
Why'd you come out tonight?
I don't know.

03:07.879 --> 03:10.949
A laugh, maybe.
But I'm not looking for a boyfriend.

03:11.113 --> 03:14.148
I got someone. I mean, kind of.
I have a dude.

03:14.313 --> 03:15.847
Who?
Why?

03:16.013 --> 03:18.958
Maybe I know him.
You don't. He's older.

03:21.947 --> 03:24.152
So why aren't you in there right now

03:24.314 --> 03:27.724
putting moves on some waifish
sophomore with low self-esteem?

03:27.882 --> 03:31.258
I just kind of have one girl
that I'm kind of interested in.

03:31.414 --> 03:33.619
So, what's her name?
Jane.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.726
Jane Nussbaum?
Harmon.

03:38.149 --> 03:39.627
So, what's your name?

03:39.782 --> 03:41.885
Dave.
Dave, I'm Aubrey.

03:42.049 --> 03:43.584
Audrey. Aubrey.

03:43.749 --> 03:45.284
Aubrey.
Yeah.

03:45.450 --> 03:48.223
And you go to North.
Senior?

03:48.383 --> 03:51.589
Junior.
Right. Of course you are, yeah.

03:51.750 --> 03:54.990
What is that supposed to mean?
Am I not mature enough for you?

03:55.151 --> 03:57.891
No, of course not.
I mean, no, of course you are.

03:58.051 --> 04:01.154
It's just, uh, you don't have that look
in your eye, you know?

04:01.318 --> 04:05.057
Not sure I do.
That desperate, kind of demented look.

04:05.218 --> 04:09.061
The "Whoo, I'm a senior and I'm
graduating in less than a month,

04:09.219 --> 04:12.856
and all my nights of drunken
high school parties are almost over."

04:13.019 --> 04:15.327
Right?
You got that look

04:15.486 --> 04:20.625
So this girl Jane, she, um...
She doesn't like you back?

04:20.786 --> 04:24.458
She likes me.
Um, platonically. As a friend.

04:24.621 --> 04:27.895
Oh, I know what "platonically" means.
I'm a junior, not a moron.

04:28.054 --> 04:29.827
I'm sorry.
It's cool, Dave.

04:29.988 --> 04:32.057
So have you tried?
Like actually tried?

04:32.221 --> 04:34.756
I think she's gonna hook up
with Brendan Meltzer tonight.

04:34.922 --> 04:36.922
Ooh, my friend hooked up with Brendan once.

04:37.089 --> 04:38.964
There you go.
He is ripped.

04:39.122 --> 04:40.828
What are you doing to me?

04:40.989 --> 04:43.399
I'm just saying if she's with Brendan
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

04:43.556 --> 04:46.830
Well, trust me, they're not up, okay?
That's why I'm out here.

04:46.990 --> 04:48.627
Because you're hiding?
I'm not hiding.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.290
Fleeing?
No.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.935
Fleeing?
Yeah.

04:52.090 --> 04:54.262
I just... Ugh.
I had to get out of there, okay?

04:54.423 --> 04:57.630
I couldn't exactly stand around
watching the girl that I'm in love with

04:57.790 --> 05:00.735
flirt with the best-looking guy ever
It's torture.

05:00.892 --> 05:04.359
Want some gum?
No, thanks. I'm good.

05:06.092 --> 05:08.036
Yeah, actually.

05:14.526 --> 05:19.232
Uh, I should get back inside before,
you know, they leave without me.

05:24.027 --> 05:25.437
Hey, let me ask you a question.

05:25.594 --> 05:26.765
Hmm?

05:26.927 --> 05:30.394
Do you think it's possible that there's
something I could say to this girl,

05:30.561 --> 05:33.903
uh, just some way I could tell her how I feel

05:34.061 --> 05:36.665
in a way that just would make her
fall for me? You know?

05:36.829 --> 05:39.636
What do you have in mind?
Here.

05:40.829 --> 05:42.102
Wow.

05:46.496 --> 05:47.974
"Jane...

05:48.630 --> 05:50.369
Janey,

05:50.530 --> 05:53.509
lately I've been feeling
like there's so much noise.

05:53.664 --> 05:58.131
You know, uh, so much static.
All these voices competing for attention.

05:58.297 --> 06:00.434
Teachers, parents, magazines.

06:00.597 --> 06:03.576
What's in, what's out, who's cool,
who's not cool enough.

06:03.732 --> 06:08.108
And it's like all this shit just gets so loud
I feel like I can't even hear myself think.

06:08.265 --> 06:11.574
You know, I just wanna get in my car and drive.

06:12.299 --> 06:14.299
But then I see you.

06:14.966 --> 06:17.944
I see you across the hall,
leaning against your locker

06:18.100 --> 06:20.339
in that jacket that you love so much,

06:20.500 --> 06:24.137
and, uh, the way you tuck your hair
back behind your ears.

06:24.300 --> 06:28.074
And you see me and you smile.

06:28.667 --> 06:33.942
You just smile,
and it's like all that noise fades away.

06:34.101 --> 06:36.011
You know?

06:36.169 --> 06:39.272
And the only thing I can hear
is the sound of your voice

06:39.435 --> 06:41.344
when you call out my name."

06:45.003 --> 06:46.276
Hmm.

06:51.970 --> 06:54.914
Oh, no. Oh, my...

06:55.070 --> 06:57.741
Oh, my God, I'm literally
too embarrassing to even live.

06:57.904 --> 07:01.007
No. No.
I can't believe I just said that. Out loud.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.649
I mean, even to you. L...

07:03.804 --> 07:06.805
I can't even believe
I was gonna say that to her. I was.

07:06.971 --> 07:11.279
Okay. It's not that
so much as she doesn't...

07:11.872 --> 07:16.578
She doesn't really care about that shit,
you know, the noise and the magazines.

07:16.739 --> 07:21.206
And she definitely doesn't wanna hear how beautiful you
think she is when she tucks her hair behind her ears.

07:21.373 --> 07:24.510
I mean, I doubt she really
wants to hear anything.

07:24.673 --> 07:28.743
All she wants to feel is a little less
freaked out than she already does,

07:28.908 --> 07:31.852
which, you know, is probably very.

07:32.008 --> 07:34.849
So she wants to be with a guy
who seems less freaked out than she is,

07:35.008 --> 07:39.510
and if you can be that guy, then rad.

07:39.675 --> 07:41.584
But if you can't...

07:42.875 --> 07:45.149
then you're not gonna be her dude.

07:46.376 --> 07:51.253
I'm never gonna be her dude, am I?
Not with that attitude, my friend, no.

07:51.409 --> 07:55.377
And you're a senior,
so I'm pretty sure that ship has sailed.

07:55.544 --> 07:58.385
Maybe in college you can reinvent
yourself as a doer, not a talker.

07:58.544 --> 07:59.578
Maybe.

08:10.611 --> 08:13.590
Well, you should probably get back, huh?

08:13.746 --> 08:16.417
Or, you know, if you're worried
your friends are gonna leave...

08:16.579 --> 08:18.114
You asked for my opinion.

08:18.279 --> 08:22.019
No, I was just gonna say
you could catch a ride home with me.

08:23.680 --> 08:27.488
Oh. Well, um...

08:29.181 --> 08:32.421
Yeah, those whores won't leave without me.

08:32.581 --> 08:34.751
They're all probably hooking up with somebody.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.586
I would have to go and unhook them,
and I don't feel like doing that, so...

08:38.748 --> 08:40.953
Then don't.
All right. I won't.

08:41.115 --> 08:42.821
Great.
Okay.

08:48.483 --> 08:49.653
This song is amazing.

08:49.815 --> 08:53.259
Yeah, this song is amazing.
Amazing.

08:57.783 --> 08:59.783
Wanna dance with me?

09:01.250 --> 09:03.922
I don't know, I...
Do you wanna...? Ahem.

09:04.084 --> 09:06.221
Do you wanna dance with me?
Hmm, no.

09:06.385 --> 09:08.260
What?
Well, l... Mm-mm.

09:08.418 --> 09:09.760
J ust...
O

09:09.918 --> 09:12.920
Man, way to build up my confidence.
You did... Well, l...

09:13.085 --> 09:16.154
Which was lacking. It was lacking.
And you even pointed it out.

09:16.319 --> 09:18.661
Look, it's just I don't dance publicly.

09:18.818 --> 09:21.023
And I don't do...
I don't do either.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.960
Those couples, they make me nauseous.
It's like, "Really, guys?

09:24.120 --> 09:28.087
You're gonna make out in the fricking
mall in front of everybody?" Ugh.

09:28.253 --> 09:32.164
Okay, well, first of all, we're
all alone here, you know.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.129
Second of all, I mean, I was just
talking about one dance, you know.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.300
Well?

10:11.491 --> 10:15.766
I can't believe I'm doing this.
It's just like the cheesiest thing ever.

10:15.926 --> 10:18.369
All we need now is for it to be raining,
and, like...

10:18.525 --> 10:21.197
I mean, it's just so tired, right?
And completely...

10:21.359 --> 10:22.995
Would you deal with it?

10:28.093 --> 10:30.298
Your balls are vibrating.

10:30.860 --> 10:31.929
Uh...
Uh...

10:35.027 --> 10:36.471
Um...

10:36.627 --> 10:37.661
Uh... Huh.

10:37.827 --> 10:40.668
What? What?
Oh, it's just the cops are here.

10:41.994 --> 10:44.563
1: Get out of here!
2: Get out of here! Cops!

10:44.728 --> 10:47.206
Where's your car?
3: We're out of here, man.

10:47.361 --> 10:49.465
Oh, I didn't drive. The Englishman did.
What?

10:49.628 --> 10:51.106
My little English friend.
Who?

10:51.262 --> 10:55.297
They're taking everybody's name, they're handcuffing people.
It's every man for himself. Let's go.

10:57.030 --> 10:59.508
What's wrong with you assholes?
Let's go.

11:07.164 --> 11:09.073
What should we do?

11:09.897 --> 11:11.773
Um, hang on, I just need to...
I'll call my...

11:33.466 --> 11:37.070
My house is like 10 blocks away.
You wanna walk with me for a little?

11:38.900 --> 11:40.640
Yes.

11:47.468 --> 11:49.241
Where are you gonna go to college?

11:49.402 --> 11:51.142
Uh, Columbia.

11:51.302 --> 11:53.439
Wow, so you're, like, Smartypants McGee.

11:53.602 --> 11:56.046
No, I don't know
about "Smartypants McGee."

11:56.203 --> 11:58.647
Any idea what you might wanna do?

11:58.803 --> 12:01.474
I wanna teach.
I wanna live in New York and teach.

12:01.636 --> 12:03.046
Oh.

12:03.404 --> 12:07.473
Elementary school to start. Somewhere
where there's a real need, you know?

12:07.637 --> 12:10.581
Uh, then probably developmental psychology.

12:10.737 --> 12:13.477
Oh, so you pretty much know
exactly what you wanna do.

12:13.637 --> 12:15.513
Yeah. How about you?

12:15.672 --> 12:17.479
I have no idea. I like collage.

12:17.638 --> 12:19.014
Collage?
And I draw some.

12:19.172 --> 12:22.343
I'm learning how to play the drums.
Helps me work out my aggression.

12:22.506 --> 12:25.347
You got a lot of aggression?
The average amount, I think.

12:25.506 --> 12:28.382
Heh. Are you, uh...?
Are you happy?

12:28.539 --> 12:29.778
Happy? Heh.

12:29.940 --> 12:33.248
Yeah, do you think of yourself
as a reasonably happy person?

12:33.407 --> 12:36.283
Content or what have you?
No, I wouldn't say content.

12:36.440 --> 12:42.317
I'm just... I'm ready to get out of here.
I'm so over high school.

12:42.474 --> 12:44.713
You've still got another year.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.443
I'm aware of that. Dick.

12:50.908 --> 12:53.113
You?
Me what?

12:53.275 --> 12:55.514
Are you a happy-go-lucky
kind of kid?

12:55.676 --> 12:58.211
Because I'll slap you if you are.

12:58.376 --> 13:02.843
Well, I am right now, which is surprising.

13:03.276 --> 13:05.118
You know I'm dating someone?

13:07.543 --> 13:08.885
Oh! Ha!

13:09.044 --> 13:11.920
Wait. Krasne?

13:12.544 --> 13:14.988
What?
No, dude, it's Wuï¬‚zheimer, dude.

13:15.145 --> 13:17.679
It's Wuï¬‚zheimer.
Sony, man, not him.

13:17.844 --> 13:19.844
Don't apologize for who you are
or who you're not.

13:20.011 --> 13:21.546
That ought to be
on a T-shin, right?

13:21.712 --> 13:23.712
You guys know where this, um...
This party's at?

13:23.879 --> 13:28.290
Oh, it just got broken up by the police.
No, dude, the one on, uh, Chestnut.

13:28.446 --> 13:30.355
That's where we just were.
You sure about that?

13:30.513 --> 13:32.048
Pretty sure.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.815
But, hey, you guys want a ride?
I guess we're heading west.

13:36.980 --> 13:40.618
No, I'm just a few blocks away.
I'm fine on my own if you wanna...

13:40.781 --> 13:42.020
Uh...

13:43.248 --> 13:46.488
Uh, actually, you know what?
We're good, man. Thanks, though.

13:46.647 --> 13:49.489
Suit yourselves.
You kids are adorable.

13:50.815 --> 13:53.656
Yeah.
Take it easy, Wuï¬‚zheimer, all right?

14:02.316 --> 14:05.817
Well, this is me.

14:09.884 --> 14:12.725
That's me. This is me.
Um...

14:12.884 --> 14:16.124
Well, hey. Uh...
Yes? Yeah?

14:16.284 --> 14:19.728
I don't know, would you wanna
maybe hang out sometime?

14:19.885 --> 14:21.385
What were we just doing?

14:22.118 --> 14:23.652
That...

14:24.018 --> 14:25.496
I don't know, I mean...
I just meant...

14:25.652 --> 14:28.687
You asking me for my number?
I was easing into it.

14:28.852 --> 14:31.160
Hmm. Okay.

14:31.786 --> 14:33.889
Okay, fine?
Yes, go. Give it to me.

14:39.054 --> 14:41.293
Do you wanna come in for a second?

14:42.120 --> 14:43.961
What about your boyfriend?

14:44.120 --> 14:47.257
I'm not gonna doink you or anything.
I know.

14:47.421 --> 14:51.025
What about your parents?
You have to be really quiet.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.226
Uh, do you want something to drink?

15:21.391 --> 15:24.063
Uh, sure.

15:24.225 --> 15:26.601
Uh, what do you want?

15:26.758 --> 15:29.202
I don't know.
Whatever you're having is fine.

15:29.359 --> 15:30.859
Well, I'm gonna have some wine.

15:34.126 --> 15:35.660
Yeah, works for me.

15:56.895 --> 15:59.328
Oh, shit.

16:10.663 --> 16:12.402
This is really very cool.

16:22.864 --> 16:24.808
<i>If it be your will</i>

16:24.965 --> 16:26.773
Heh. It's true, huh?

16:26.931 --> 16:29.808
The sound quality
really is way better than a download.

16:29.966 --> 16:31.000
Not really.

16:31.732 --> 16:33.438
Oh.

16:34.966 --> 16:36.000
Then why...?

16:36.166 --> 16:41.611
I just like the idea of it.
You know, a record collection.

16:41.766 --> 16:43.710
You know, most of them are my dad's.

16:43.866 --> 16:46.344
<i>I will speak no more</i>

16:47.267 --> 16:51.144
<i>Ishall abide until</i>

16:53.668 --> 16:56.475
<i>I am spoken for</i>

16:57.602 --> 17:00.308
<i>If it be your will</i>

17:03.336 --> 17:06.176
You wanna know when I'm really happy?

17:06.336 --> 17:07.837
Four o'clock.

17:08.002 --> 17:11.174
Home from school, and the sun
comes through that window

17:11.337 --> 17:15.804
and just makes the carpet all, like, warm.

17:16.971 --> 17:19.743
And I sit here cutting out pictures.

17:19.904 --> 17:23.040
When I was little, it was Crayolas, but...

17:23.204 --> 17:25.876
I've never been more content than when I'm just,

17:26.038 --> 17:28.948
you know, by myself, doing my thing.

17:30.272 --> 17:32.216
Yeah, I know what you mean.

17:32.372 --> 17:35.578
I mean, I'm not alone much,
definitely not in my house,

17:35.739 --> 17:38.876
but, um, I have my car.

17:39.039 --> 17:43.484
Some nights, I just like to drive around,
music up, windows down, just...

17:43.640 --> 17:44.879
Have you had sex yet?

17:47.207 --> 17:50.048
What?
Just asking.

17:51.407 --> 17:54.147
Honestly?
No, lie to me.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.116
Not yet.

17:58.642 --> 18:01.518
I mean, not that there haven't been
some opportunities.

18:01.675 --> 18:03.983
Oh, yeah, girls lining up to have sex with you?

18:04.142 --> 18:05.915
No, that's not what I meant.

18:06.610 --> 18:08.315
You wanna have sex with Jane?

18:09.476 --> 18:14.853
I guess, yeah. But I don't like
to fantasize about, um...

18:15.010 --> 18:18.954
I fantasize about holding her hand
and kissing in the rain.

18:19.110 --> 18:21.748
You know, all that cheesy, tired romantic shit

18:21.911 --> 18:23.889
that you're such a fan of.

18:24.044 --> 18:27.181
And I fantasize about having sex
with Casey Flynn.

18:27.345 --> 18:31.085
Is that an actress I should know?
She's a girl who goes to my school.

18:31.246 --> 18:34.985
She's the girl that everyone wants to have
sex with because she's, you know, mean.

18:35.878 --> 18:37.117
Oh.

18:37.279 --> 18:39.985
Jane's the girl that you want
to be your girlfriend.

18:40.146 --> 18:44.488
The virgin and the skank.
Tale as old as time.

18:45.113 --> 18:46.648
Have you done it yet?

18:48.047 --> 18:49.683
None of your business.

19:04.115 --> 19:09.822
Everything cool has been ruined.
Was before we got here.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.893
Even sex and relationships.

19:13.617 --> 19:17.959
It's all just so safe and convenient.

19:18.117 --> 19:20.322
Homogenized.

19:20.750 --> 19:25.718
Exchange profiles, boil your personality
down to some, like, compatibility equation.

19:25.884 --> 19:28.760
<i>What's your favorite movie?
Who's your favorite recording artist?</i>

19:28.918 --> 19:30.123
And then with one easy click,

19:30.285 --> 19:33.923
we too can realize our dream
of boning someone exactly like us.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.859
Get married,
give birth to two and a half babies.

19:37.019 --> 19:42.555
We can all post the pictures
on Facebook or Twitter.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.959
No, that's... That is not for me.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.962
I wanna meet a man
the old-fashioned way, you know,

19:49.120 --> 19:51.189
like in a bar.

19:52.787 --> 19:57.595
How about a dark alley?
Crazy guy who talks to himself?

20:01.555 --> 20:03.362
Give me your hand.

20:10.956 --> 20:13.263
Which one am I?

20:13.422 --> 20:15.661
The virgin or the skank?

20:19.223 --> 20:22.360
I've never met anyone like you before.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.833
That's a pretty good answer.

20:30.025 --> 20:32.593
<i>If it be your will</i>

20:34.992 --> 20:38.129
<i>If there is a choice</i>

20:40.126 --> 20:43.502
<i>Let the rivers fill</i>

20:45.193 --> 20:48.501
<i>Let the hills rejoice</i>

20:50.060 --> 20:55.936
<i>Let your mercy spill
On all these burning hearts in hell</i>

20:56.094 --> 20:59.300
I have trouble sleeping
with someone in the room.

20:59.461 --> 21:02.632
Oh. I'll take off.
No.

21:03.861 --> 21:08.567
It's just, sleepovers, camp,
I always hated them.

21:08.729 --> 21:10.570
Not because I minded being away,

21:10.729 --> 21:14.674
but because there was always
some mouth breather next to me.

21:14.830 --> 21:16.808
You don't have to explain.
I'll go.

21:16.963 --> 21:20.339
Not yet. I just, um...

21:22.230 --> 21:25.071
Maybe we could lie here for a minute.

21:25.964 --> 21:30.500
And I could just close my eyes,
see what it's like.

21:31.431 --> 21:33.136
Is that okay?

21:34.231 --> 21:36.073
Okay.

21:36.798 --> 21:39.538
<i>All dressed to kill</i>

21:42.232 --> 21:44.574
<i>And end this night</i>

21:45.899 --> 21:48.377
<i>If it be your will</i>

21:49.699 --> 21:51.541
<i>If it be your will</i>

21:51.700 --> 21:53.507
Your heart is beating really fast.

21:53.667 --> 21:55.508
I know.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.407
Sony.

21:58.268 --> 22:00.303
It's cool, Hodgman.

22:21.737 --> 22:24.544
Honey, wake up. It's almost 11.

22:25.870 --> 22:27.905
Oh, shit.
Aubrey?

22:28.070 --> 22:30.708
Yeah. I'll be out in a minute.
Okay.

22:32.038 --> 22:35.880
Oh. Oh, God, no. I'm so sorry.

22:39.071 --> 22:41.175
Okay, you've gotta get out.
The window.

22:49.906 --> 22:52.077
Hurry.
Uh, okay.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.911
What now?
Jump.

23:13.276 --> 23:16.516
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

23:16.676 --> 23:20.415
Okay, go. Call me.
Okay. Yes.

23:20.576 --> 23:23.453
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't even think I got your number.

23:23.610 --> 23:24.679
Au b rey?

23:26.343 --> 23:28.083
Aubrey!

23:35.044 --> 23:37.454
Badass. I was like
Jason Bourne, you know?

23:37.611 --> 23:41.488
Or Jason Statham.
Then I called you.

23:43.445 --> 23:46.480
What?
You're a sweet boy, you know that?

23:46.646 --> 23:48.487
Shut up.
No, you truly are.

23:48.646 --> 23:51.420
Your Bambi-like innocence
is just, what? Adorable.

23:51.580 --> 23:53.649
I'm gonna pinch your cheek.
Screw you.

23:53.813 --> 23:56.087
David, there is no boyfriend.

23:56.247 --> 23:58.350
But...
No.

23:58.513 --> 24:00.923
What, you think she made it up?
\Yes, of course she did.

24:01.080 --> 24:04.059
Girls have to say they have a boyfriend
when they meet some random dick.

24:04.214 --> 24:07.056
It's practically in the manual.
I don't know, I really believed her.

24:07.215 --> 24:10.625
Of course you did. Even now,
when I'm assuring you it's bullshit.

24:10.782 --> 24:13.851
It's how you know if she likes you.
In a couple of days, chuck her a text.

24:14.016 --> 24:17.687
See if she wants to hang out, get some
Chinese, get some Szechuan chicken.

24:17.849 --> 24:20.885
If she says "boyfriend," you know she
didn't really like you. Thanks, love.

24:21.049 --> 24:24.256
<i>But you can always tell yourself,
Hey, she has a boyfriend.</i>

24:24.416 --> 24:28.657
You know? "it's not me."
It's a good system. Tell him.

24:30.417 --> 24:32.224
I'm not gonna text her.
Why not?

24:32.384 --> 24:35.022
I thought you said
she had a tight little bottom.

24:35.184 --> 24:38.128
Because.
Because of Jane?

24:38.285 --> 24:40.559
Seriously, David, that's never gonna happen.

24:40.718 --> 24:43.389
I accidentally spilled wine on her carpet.

24:44.219 --> 24:46.856
Right. Who gives a shit?
She does.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.258
She's got this thing about her carpet.

24:49.419 --> 24:55.365
The way the sunlight hits it
at a certain point in the afternoon and...

24:57.387 --> 24:59.797
Couldn't text her even if I wanted to.

24:59.954 --> 25:01.727
She didn't give you her number, did she?

25:01.887 --> 25:03.297
No. She started to.

25:03.454 --> 25:06.261
She typed in the first few digits,
and then we...

25:07.288 --> 25:09.823
But I did get those first three digits
on my phone, right? So...

25:09.988 --> 25:13.592
I mean, come on, how many possible
combinations of numbers could there really be?

25:13.755 --> 25:15.529
Ten thousand.

25:16.589 --> 25:19.294
Just call Information.
Don't be stupid, okay?

25:19.455 --> 25:21.229
She's not gonna be listed.

25:21.390 --> 25:23.924
Plus, I don't even know
her parents' first names.

25:24.089 --> 25:27.295
And Lashanda says there's like
337 Millers in Deranja County.

25:27.456 --> 25:28.729
What's the shit's a Lashanda?

25:28.890 --> 25:31.095
The lady I talked to when I called Information.

25:31.257 --> 25:32.599
Well, you know where she lives.

25:32.757 --> 25:37.429
I know where she... Great.
So I could stand outside of her house?

25:37.591 --> 25:39.865
Because that won't be so creepy.
Yes. Great.

25:40.025 --> 25:43.003
Find her on Facebook.
I don't think she does Facebook.

25:43.158 --> 25:44.966
She doesn't believe in that son of thing.

25:45.125 --> 25:46.865
She doesn't believe in it?

25:47.458 --> 25:50.629
This girl sounds like a ginormous
ass-ache, my friend.

25:50.792 --> 25:53.464
Like a huge ache in my ass.

25:53.626 --> 25:55.729
I'm telling you, I know the type.
I know the type.

25:55.893 --> 25:59.133
The alternative rock indie chick
who only goes to an films,

25:59.294 --> 26:02.602
smells like vegan food,
can't be bothered to shave her pits.

26:02.761 --> 26:05.898
Eventually falls in love
with a scaly bull dyke named Harley.

26:06.061 --> 26:07.868
Where do you even come up...?
Stanvvyck.

26:08.028 --> 26:10.336
What are you jabbering about?
Stanvvyck goes to North.

26:10.495 --> 26:13.439
Stanvvyck goes to North.
We'll call Stanvvyck.

26:13.595 --> 26:16.267
He'll have access to the student
database. Just thought of that.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.534
:
What do you want?

26:22.696 --> 26:24.469
Stanvvyck, it's Daldly. I need a favor.

26:24.629 --> 26:27.835
You can finally pay me back
for giving you Courtney Yamazaki.

26:27.996 --> 26:31.099
She was never gonna go outwith you.
She thinks you're disgusting.

26:31.263 --> 26:34.208
Whatever gets you through the night.
What do you want?

26:34.363 --> 26:36.467
We need a number for a girl that goes to North.

26:36.630 --> 26:39.199
Uh, hold on a sec. What year?

26:39.364 --> 26:42.535
Junior.
Who was that?

26:42.698 --> 26:44.176
Uh, it's Hodgman.

26:44.332 --> 26:48.140
Uh, junior. Okay.
It's gonna be Aubrey Miller.

26:48.299 --> 26:51.209
Miller, Audrey.
Aubrey.

26:51.365 --> 26:54.707
Aubrey Miller.
Just an address and the home number.

26:54.866 --> 26:57.071
No cell?
What did I say?

26:57.233 --> 26:58.677
Okay, how about an e-mail?

26:58.833 --> 27:02.868
Just the home number.
You want it or not, Dave?

27:03.900 --> 27:05.809
Yes, give us the number.

27:07.034 --> 27:10.036
<i>I went out with this guy</i>

27:10.200 --> 27:12.838
<i>This guy</i>

27:13.001 --> 27:15.911
Hey, we're gonna see that movie
tonight, 7:15, Old Orchard.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.569
What movie?
Where the world ends in like five days.

27:18.735 --> 27:21.077
Three days.
Three days. Not a lot of time.

27:21.236 --> 27:23.214
That movie's gonna suck.
I think I'll skip it.

27:23.369 --> 27:24.903
David.

27:25.770 --> 27:30.078
Look, it goes without saying, leave it
a few days before you call this girl.

27:30.237 --> 27:32.646
You know, let's give the illusion
that you have a life.

27:32.803 --> 27:36.976
Of course. Of course. I mean, I'm happy
we got the number, but I don't know.

27:37.137 --> 27:39.376
I probably...
Hey, probably won't even call her at all.

27:39.537 --> 27:42.516
We'll see. We'll see how I feel
by the end of the week or something.

27:42.671 --> 27:43.774
Or in like a couple weeks.

27:44.271 --> 27:49.239
Uh, hi, yes, is this Mr. Miller?
I don't take solicitations.

27:49.405 --> 27:53.475
No, no, no. I'm, uh...
I'm actually a friend of your...

27:54.039 --> 27:58.246
Well, one of your daughters.
Only got the one that I'm aware of.

27:58.406 --> 28:00.907
Yup, right, okay.
Well, I'm a friend of Aubrey's.

28:01.073 --> 28:02.449
Uh-huh.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.542
Yes, well, may I speak with her, please?

28:09.141 --> 28:10.709
Hello?
Aubrey?

28:10.874 --> 28:14.012
Speaking.
Well, hey, it's Dave.

28:14.174 --> 28:18.483
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Uh, hold on one second.

28:18.641 --> 28:20.449
One second. Um...

28:23.676 --> 28:26.177
Hi. What's up?

28:26.343 --> 28:31.048
Oh, uh, well, nothing much, actually.
I just, uh...

28:31.209 --> 28:35.711
I got home safely, so there's that.
Rest easy, I guess. Heh.

28:35.877 --> 28:38.946
But I don't know, I just wanted
to make sure that, um, you were cool.

28:39.110 --> 28:43.112
You know, that everything was cool with,
uh, you know...

28:43.277 --> 28:44.311
Yeah.

28:44.477 --> 28:46.114
Yeah, everything's cool?
Yeah.

28:46.278 --> 28:51.018
Great. Good. Sweet.
Uh, well, okay. Um...

28:51.745 --> 28:54.951
Well, hey, I also wanted to say, uh...
Well, or ask you.

28:55.112 --> 28:56.817
What are you doing later?

28:57.246 --> 28:58.951
Uh, I don't know.
Ha, ha.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.351
I think I'm gonna go to a movie with Ronny.

29:01.513 --> 29:03.048
Ronny?
Ronny.

29:03.213 --> 29:04.418
Ronny. Of course.

29:04.579 --> 29:08.456
That's good. That's actually funny, though,
because I'm going to the movies tonight too.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.956
Um, but we're going to Old Orchard.

29:12.314 --> 29:13.451
Well, that's where I'm going.

29:14.315 --> 29:17.054
Then I guess I'll see you.
Maybe.

29:17.214 --> 29:20.522
All right. Well, cool.
Cool.

29:20.682 --> 29:22.557
Later.

29:29.716 --> 29:33.592
I think that went pretty well, right?

29:38.450 --> 29:39.951
Can we finish this?
Listen.

29:40.117 --> 29:42.493
I'm not gonna lecture you on parenting.
That's not my thing.

29:42.650 --> 29:45.026
You stick to your area,
and I will stick to mine.

29:45.184 --> 29:46.560
But let me just say this:

29:46.718 --> 29:49.525
We all knew at some point
I was going to have a drink.

29:49.685 --> 29:52.630
It's inevitable.
I am a teenager, and this is America,

29:52.785 --> 29:57.094
and isn't it way better that I do it here,
alone in my room with a glass of wine,

29:57.252 --> 30:00.594
rather than at some party, doing Jager
shots with some frat-boy date rapist?

30:00.752 --> 30:03.992
Or when I could be killed
in, like, a fiery car accident?

30:05.787 --> 30:09.197
Well?
Look, this isn't just about wine. This...

30:09.354 --> 30:12.423
You spilled it. You... You...

30:13.554 --> 30:16.623
Ugh. I don't even know.
What was the question again?

30:16.788 --> 30:20.426
Can I go to the movies tonight, or are we
gonna punish me for being responsible?

30:25.355 --> 30:26.924
Really?

30:29.323 --> 30:31.028
You may go.

30:31.889 --> 30:33.390
Good.

30:34.289 --> 30:35.622
It was a good talk.

30:36.356 --> 30:39.494
<i>Whoa, whoa</i>

30:39.657 --> 30:42.396
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah</i>

30:42.891 --> 30:45.130
<i>Whoa, whoa</i>

30:45.291 --> 30:46.461
How you doing?

30:49.891 --> 30:52.062
Well, you know, I've been better.

30:52.224 --> 30:55.828
I've had a really rough week, emotionally.

30:55.992 --> 30:59.163
And I'm telling you
because I might not be, like,

30:59.326 --> 31:02.827
a ton of fun tonight or...

31:02.993 --> 31:04.993
You've been crying.

31:08.126 --> 31:09.832
Anyway-

31:10.393 --> 31:12.065
How are you?

31:12.827 --> 31:14.328
Fine.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.564
This is so not cool.
What am I doing here, you know?

31:20.628 --> 31:26.039
She's gonna think I'm stalking her
like some weird, creepy nerd.

31:26.195 --> 31:28.434
Remember Aaron Finklestein?
Uh-huh.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.595
That's gonna be me.
That's gonna be me.

31:30.762 --> 31:32.831
God, the poor bastard
was never heard from again.

31:32.996 --> 31:34.769
Then again, I don't plan on raping anybody.

31:34.929 --> 31:37.998
Don't look now, lambchop.
This shit just got real.

31:38.163 --> 31:39.971
No, okay...
Hey.

31:42.730 --> 31:44.675
Mr. Daldly.
Jane.

31:44.830 --> 31:48.071
B. Hey, where did you
disappear to last night?

31:48.230 --> 31:50.435
I was looking for you.
Um, I was around.

31:50.597 --> 31:53.269
I wanted us to have
one of our famous late-night talks.

31:53.432 --> 31:56.171
So, what are you doing later?
Um, I don't know.

31:56.332 --> 31:58.674
Daldly, what are we doing later?
Uh, no commitments.

31:58.832 --> 32:02.106
We're keeping our options open. Although I
may have a lead for a party in La Mesa.

32:02.266 --> 32:05.267
We could go to my house.
The parentals are in Cabo,

32:05.433 --> 32:08.037
and I told those losers from Huntington
I may have people over.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.235
Come on. What are we seeing?

32:10.400 --> 32:13.344
Hey, Dave.
Hey. Hey.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.907
Hi. Um, I'm Jane.

32:17.801 --> 32:20.473
Oh, I'm Aubrey.
This is Ronny.

32:20.634 --> 32:21.805
What's up, dudes?

32:21.967 --> 32:23.206
Hey, Daldly.
Yeah?

32:23.368 --> 32:25.812
Come meet Aubrey and her boyfriend, Ronny.

32:25.968 --> 32:27.673
Her boyfriend, Ronny.

32:27.835 --> 32:31.439
Oh, marvelous. I'm Simon Daldry
Pleasure to meet you both.

32:33.569 --> 32:37.070
This is, uh, Brianna, Erica, Big Corporation.

32:37.236 --> 32:38.270
Wait, sorry?

32:38.437 --> 32:41.142
It's a football thing.
It's what everyone calls him.

32:41.303 --> 32:42.713
Big Corporation.
I get it.

32:42.870 --> 32:45.178
It's funny because corporations
are destroying everything.

32:45.337 --> 32:48.179
Like the environment, democracy, culture, music.

32:48.338 --> 32:50.782
It's ironic. I love it.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.939
Right. We're gonna see
How the World Ends, yeah?

32:55.105 --> 32:57.481
How about you guys?
Uh, the new AlmodÃ©var film.

32:57.638 --> 33:00.310
Oh, actually, no.
I'm not down for subtitles tonight.

33:00.472 --> 33:02.780
Is it cool if we see something else?

33:03.372 --> 33:04.406
Oh. Heh.

33:04.572 --> 33:08.642
She's so bashful. But don't be fooled.
She's a tigress when we're alone.

33:08.806 --> 33:10.341
Whatever you want, my little tiger cub.

33:10.506 --> 33:13.075
You wanna go and see a dumb
kiddy movie, that's fine by me.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.446
I just wanna be next to you tonight.
Yeah.

33:19.973 --> 33:21.474
1:
Go, go, go, go, go!

33:24.674 --> 33:25.674
Mommy!

33:27.675 --> 33:30.448
2:
Not on my watch, you alien bitch.

33:56.278 --> 33:59.745
1: Come on, boys. Lock and load.
Hit them high, hit them low.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.087
2:
Suck on this.

34:11.313 --> 34:13.847
2: Tell Mikey I love him
and I'll always love him.

34:14.013 --> 34:15.422
1:
You tell him yourself.

34:19.047 --> 34:21.456
1:
Run. Go. Run, run.

34:33.482 --> 34:35.482
We've only got one shot at this.

34:56.751 --> 34:59.229
Really wonderful film, huh?

34:59.751 --> 35:03.127
Yeah. It's touching.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.297
Hey, listen...
I'm sorry

35:06.452 --> 35:10.454
that I made you jump off the roof.
That was nuts. And dangerous.

35:10.619 --> 35:14.063
And I'm sorry if I was a little, like...
Ugh.

35:14.220 --> 35:17.686
You know, on the phone.
I just... I wig out a little sometimes.

35:17.853 --> 35:21.457
Not that that's an excuse.
Give me your cell.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.388
Uh... Oh.

35:31.855 --> 35:35.799
Okay. And I forgive you.

35:39.255 --> 35:42.392
So...
So.

35:42.556 --> 35:48.593
So you're here with Jane.
She's really pretty.

35:48.757 --> 35:50.133
Yeah, she's all right.

35:50.290 --> 35:53.360
And she's sitting next to you
and she's holding your hand.

35:53.523 --> 35:56.195
It kind of seems like she likes you.
No.

35:56.358 --> 35:57.859
I don't know.
Okay.

35:58.024 --> 36:02.026
I'm definitely having thoughts
about the sexy time with her, though.

36:02.192 --> 36:04.431
Wow.
Definitely. So thanks for that.

36:04.592 --> 36:07.035
Maybe that's good.
Take her off the pedestal.

36:07.192 --> 36:08.795
Besides, that cheeseball romance stuff?

36:08.959 --> 36:12.960
That's strictly for Nicholas Sparks books
and commercials for De Beers.

36:13.126 --> 36:16.229
It's like Zussman says, it's all biology.
Natural selection.

36:16.393 --> 36:17.928
A female chooses her strongest mate

36:18.094 --> 36:20.435
so that her offspring have
a greater chance at survival.

36:20.593 --> 36:21.627
Zussman?

36:21.793 --> 36:25.067
Uh, Mr. Zussman.
He's my biology teacher.

36:25.227 --> 36:27.705
Although I suppose he's selling something too.

36:27.861 --> 36:31.601
Well, I'm not sure I'm the strongest mate
in my particular gene pool,

36:31.761 --> 36:34.035
Ugh.
But I guess we can give it shot, right?

36:34.195 --> 36:36.104
Come on.
Confidence is sexy, Hodgman.

36:36.261 --> 36:39.240
I know. That's what my mom
keeps telling me.

36:39.396 --> 36:41.896
I should go back inside.

36:42.062 --> 36:43.472
Yeah.

36:44.763 --> 36:46.900
Well, hey, Ronny seems like a cool guy.

36:47.063 --> 36:48.506
Does he?
No.

36:48.663 --> 36:51.505
Uh, well... I mean, I can't tell yet.

36:53.330 --> 36:54.774
Okay.

36:54.931 --> 36:57.034
Hey, listen. Um...

36:57.697 --> 37:01.039
A bunch of us were gonna go
to that girl's house after, to Brianna's.

37:01.198 --> 37:03.904
Mm-hm.
Uh, I guess some other people too.

37:04.065 --> 37:06.838
It's not like a party. It's just a thing.
Okay.

37:06.998 --> 37:09.442
Yeah, let me talk to him.
Sweet. Talk to him.

37:09.599 --> 37:12.270
I guess, uh, enjoy the end of the world.

37:21.800 --> 37:22.869
I wanna travel.

37:26.167 --> 37:27.974
All right.
Last night you got me thinking

37:28.134 --> 37:31.408
about what I wanna do,
and I definitely wanna travel.

37:32.334 --> 37:33.368
Like, as a career?

37:33.534 --> 37:37.445
Last summer I, uh, got to visit my uncle
and his boyfriend in Madrid.

37:37.602 --> 37:40.705
One day I was just, like,
walking around and I got lost.

37:40.869 --> 37:42.346
And, you know, my cell phone was dead,

37:42.502 --> 37:44.208
and I had no idea where their apartment was.

37:44.370 --> 37:48.473
Then I was worried I was gonna have to adapt
to life as a street person in Madrid.

37:48.636 --> 37:50.341
Finally I just wandered out into this plaza

37:50.503 --> 37:52.845
and I sat by this fountain
and I just, like, breathed.

37:53.003 --> 37:57.505
And I realized I had been so focused
on where I was going and getting back

37:57.671 --> 38:01.479
that I hadn't even noticed where I was.

38:01.637 --> 38:04.241
I hadn't noticed anything.
And so I started to.

38:04.405 --> 38:06.383
I started to notice, like,

38:06.971 --> 38:09.472
the personality of the architecture and, like,

38:11.272 --> 38:15.011
The way people would just, like,
greet each other on the streets.

38:15.172 --> 38:20.310
And even the sky looked, like,
different over there.

38:20.473 --> 38:23.577
And it felt like I was just letting go
of something.

38:24.374 --> 38:28.648
But also like I'm finally in the world.

38:30.241 --> 38:32.378
Eventually, I found my way back,
but those few hours,

38:32.541 --> 38:34.678
those were, like, the best.

38:35.141 --> 38:38.915
It was the best pan of my trip, and I just...

38:39.075 --> 38:43.349
I wanna get back out there so bad.
There's so much stuff I wanna see.

38:44.175 --> 38:45.710
Huh.

38:46.376 --> 38:47.854
What?

38:49.542 --> 38:51.316
Wow, that was so stupid.

38:51.477 --> 38:53.546
No, no, no.
No, I'm sorry. That was weird.

38:53.710 --> 38:55.813
It wasn't stupid. I just... I was...

38:56.643 --> 39:01.281
I was just listening to you,
and I wanna go with you.

39:04.711 --> 39:06.382
Okay.

39:07.178 --> 39:10.679
Hey, babe.
What am I, seeing this shit alone?

39:10.845 --> 39:13.824
Yeah. I mean, no. No. No, heh.

39:13.979 --> 39:16.616
I'm coming. Oh, and, uh, here.

39:28.947 --> 39:31.425
Let me tell you guys something.

39:31.581 --> 39:35.185
Something you don't know, because you
haven't really been out in the world yet.

39:35.814 --> 39:39.054
But when you get to my age,
you'll realize that...

39:40.348 --> 39:42.519
You know, that everything is just bullshit.

39:43.116 --> 39:45.684
Nobody cares about anything
except making money, you know?

39:45.849 --> 39:48.054
Like dollar, dollar bills, y'all.

39:48.216 --> 39:52.888
So some glorified little office boy,
junior-executive prick

39:53.050 --> 39:56.358
is gonna tell the Joan Cusack
Experience our stuff isn't commercial?

39:56.517 --> 39:59.723
Screw you, pal. No.
No, I mean, I can probably...

39:59.884 --> 40:04.226
What is the Joan Cusack Experience?
I think it's the name of his band.

40:04.385 --> 40:07.761
- To be an artist. You know,
he's an idiot. "Sir, you're an idiot."

40:07.917 --> 40:10.486
That's why you just gotta focus on the basics.

40:10.651 --> 40:13.095
The fundamentals.
The simple things, you know?

40:13.252 --> 40:14.888
The simple intricacies of life.

40:19.619 --> 40:21.120
What are you thinking?

40:21.286 --> 40:26.196
I think whoever said you should always
be yourself obviously never met Ronny.

40:32.087 --> 40:36.532
Isn't this pool nuts?
I feel like we're at Hef's mansion.

40:38.521 --> 40:42.227
I'm Jane.
Aubrey. We met.

40:42.389 --> 40:46.697
Right. You know Dave.
Yeah. A little.

40:47.889 --> 40:49.423
Do you, like,

40:50.589 --> 40:52.033
like him?

40:52.189 --> 40:56.133
Heh, what?
No. No, no. I, um...

40:56.289 --> 40:58.029
No, I'm with, um...

40:59.957 --> 41:01.663
that g-

41:02.491 --> 41:04.901
Oh. Wow.

41:05.057 --> 41:06.535
He is gorgeous.

41:06.691 --> 41:09.897
I mean, I like Dave as a friend.
He's cool.

41:10.058 --> 41:11.559
No, Dave is amazing.

41:12.125 --> 41:16.592
He's one of my best friends.
Definitely my best guy friend.

41:16.759 --> 41:20.636
He's always been there for me, through
all my terrible relationships and shit,

41:20.792 --> 41:22.532
and I can tell him anything.

41:22.693 --> 41:26.297
He gives the best advice.
He's so smart.

41:26.459 --> 41:28.404
You should see the way he is with his sister.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.037
His sister?
Yeah, she's 5.

41:31.193 --> 41:33.296
Or maybe 6. But so, so cute.

41:33.460 --> 41:35.460
And he's, like, super involved in her life,

41:35.627 --> 41:38.696
because I guess the dad
isn't really around or whatever.

41:38.861 --> 41:40.237
Where is he?

41:40.395 --> 41:43.373
It's just that most guys our age are
completely self-absorbed, you know?

41:43.995 --> 41:48.303
Yeah, I know. And they never shut up.
Never, right?

41:48.462 --> 41:51.133
God, I am so sick of these arrogant jagweeds,

41:51.295 --> 41:55.831
with their big stupid mouths
and their tiny little penises.

41:55.996 --> 41:59.372
We're not talking about Dave anymore.
We're talking about Brendan Meltzer.

41:59.530 --> 42:02.997
Is he a douche bag?
World's most humongous douche bag.

42:03.164 --> 42:04.369
Like, officially.

42:04.530 --> 42:06.940
And you know what the
really sick pan is? I knew it. I knew.

42:07.097 --> 42:10.042
And I knew he was probably
gonna tell everyone that we...

42:10.197 --> 42:14.801
Because I've pretty much heard about every single
girl he's hooked up with, so why would I be any...?

42:14.965 --> 42:17.842
But anyway, I don't know.

42:17.998 --> 42:22.500
All I want is once
for one of these boys to just, like,

42:22.665 --> 42:24.473
ask me a question, you know?

42:26.733 --> 42:30.836
Like my opinion or how I'm doing
or really anything.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.001
Because at this point, if one of them
were to, like, open the door for me

42:35.167 --> 42:36.668
or offer to buy dinner,

42:36.834 --> 42:40.074
I would be so frigging shocked,
I would probably fall over.

42:43.734 --> 42:45.508
You know,

42:46.368 --> 42:49.176
sometimes it's just the guy that you...

42:51.969 --> 42:53.675
Sometimes what?

42:56.269 --> 42:57.303
Hmm?

42:58.070 --> 43:01.241
Weren't you...?
You were about to say something.

43:01.404 --> 43:03.143
Was I?

43:04.070 --> 43:05.571
No.

43:06.203 --> 43:11.342
No, no. Well, heh, yes,
but now it's gone. Poof.

43:11.904 --> 43:16.315
It was just, like, a second ago.
Yeah. Weird, right?

43:16.471 --> 43:17.744
Yeah.

43:17.905 --> 43:19.349
Hey.

43:20.072 --> 43:21.675
You.

43:28.639 --> 43:29.673
Dave.

43:29.839 --> 43:32.044
So where did you meet my lady?

43:32.907 --> 43:36.010
In an alley.
She's, uh, pretty great, huh?

43:36.174 --> 43:38.118
What?
She's pretty great.

43:38.274 --> 43:41.684
You know. Pretty, pretty, pretty great.

43:42.107 --> 43:44.210
Yeah, she is.

43:44.374 --> 43:48.410
I mean, I don't usually go for high school girls.
Too needy. Way too immature.

43:48.575 --> 43:50.450
But this one,

43:51.308 --> 43:53.116
you know, she's inspiring.

43:53.275 --> 43:55.480
I'm actually writing a song about her.

43:55.642 --> 43:58.143
Well, about her knees.

44:03.410 --> 44:05.581
We're gonna have sex tonight.

44:08.277 --> 44:09.311
Yeah?

44:09.477 --> 44:12.819
Yeah. We were supposed to do it
last weekend, but I got the flu.

44:12.978 --> 44:14.422
Sure.

44:14.577 --> 44:19.249
I'm not gonna lie to you, Dan, it's been a
long time coming, but we're finally doing it.

44:19.412 --> 44:21.515
Gonna do it to it.

44:23.512 --> 44:25.184
So where is this taking place?

44:26.012 --> 44:29.923
Um, probably in my van.
Jesus.

44:30.579 --> 44:32.454
Shit, I gotta move that kick drum.

44:32.613 --> 44:37.718
Well, Ronny, that sounds unforgettable.

44:37.881 --> 44:43.655
Pretty, pretty unforgettable.

44:48.915 --> 44:50.517
I'm, uh...

44:52.416 --> 44:54.950
gonna go drain the Lil Wayne.

45:38.553 --> 45:41.293
You never told me you have a sister.

45:42.287 --> 45:44.322
I guess it never came up.

45:44.487 --> 45:47.988
She's my half sister, technically.

45:48.155 --> 45:51.463
Her dad's not really
in our lives anymore anyway, so...

45:51.622 --> 45:53.896
What about your dad?

45:54.055 --> 45:56.896
Remarried. Lives in Stovington.

45:57.055 --> 45:59.124
He's an endodontist.

45:59.955 --> 46:02.229
Gives one hell of a root canal,
if you're ever in need.

46:02.389 --> 46:06.266
You know, I just had this very
clear image in my head of you

46:06.424 --> 46:08.424
and what your life was like and your family.

46:08.590 --> 46:11.193
And it turns out that it was completely wrong.

46:11.357 --> 46:13.301
Stupid of me to think that
I knew you after one night.

46:13.457 --> 46:16.026
Please don't have sex with Ronny.

46:17.924 --> 46:19.493
The guy is unbelievable.

46:19.658 --> 46:22.068
Yeah. You can't lose
your virginity to him.

46:22.224 --> 46:25.135
Why not?
Are you...? Are you kidding me?

46:25.292 --> 46:26.997
You know, it's not some beautiful thing.

46:27.159 --> 46:29.569
It's not some treasure that I have to guard

46:29.726 --> 46:34.068
until I find the one or the right person.

46:34.226 --> 46:38.398
Because there is no right person.
There's just some dude.

46:38.560 --> 46:41.970
Okay? And it happens, and it's a little
gnarly and kind of uncomfortable,

46:42.127 --> 46:44.503
but one day, one day it's gonna be terrific.

46:44.660 --> 46:46.798
It's gonna be like crazy
porno-sex terrific.

46:46.960 --> 46:50.370
So I just gotta get from here to there
safely and on my own terms.

46:50.528 --> 46:54.405
And I know that Ronny is safe because I
have my own copy of his test results.

46:54.562 --> 46:59.199
So would you please, please just tell me
why I can't go and get it over with?

47:03.029 --> 47:06.337
You know, I think it's finding
the right person that makes it special.

47:06.863 --> 47:11.205
Okay? But it sure as shit is not that guy.
Okay.

47:12.763 --> 47:14.639
You know what, Dave? Heh.

47:15.898 --> 47:19.774
You... You are in love with Jane.
You're in love with her.

47:19.931 --> 47:24.342
You are in love with her smile and her hair
tucking and her annoyingly perfect olive skin.

47:24.498 --> 47:29.341
I mean, who has skin like that?
It's ridiculous. It's, like, per...

47:29.498 --> 47:31.772
You've got great skin.
Yeah, well, thank you.

47:31.932 --> 47:34.501
But that's because I work
really hard at my skin, okay?

47:34.666 --> 47:37.167
I'm on a first-name basis
with my dermatologist.

47:37.332 --> 47:39.867
If there's a problem,
then Phyllis and I, we deal with it.

47:40.033 --> 47:44.910
But that's not the point here.
That's not the point.

47:45.600 --> 47:50.705
The point is that you are infatuated with Jane.

47:51.268 --> 47:52.940
So I'm gonna go do Ronny.

47:55.334 --> 47:57.505
Why are you smiling?

47:58.569 --> 48:00.513
You dig me.

48:02.736 --> 48:06.737
No. No. Heh, please.

48:06.903 --> 48:12.008
Oh, so, what, you're like this
confident, cocky guy now?

48:12.170 --> 48:14.115
You're that guy?

48:14.770 --> 48:16.407
I guess.
Right.

48:16.570 --> 48:21.709
And that's not just because your mom
and I said that you should be more...

48:21.871 --> 48:25.042
confident?
I don't know. Maybe.

48:26.138 --> 48:27.843
What do you think?

48:28.005 --> 48:29.779
I just...

48:29.939 --> 48:32.212
I think that you should probably...

48:32.372 --> 48:33.782
Aubrey. We gotta go.

48:33.939 --> 48:37.213
Uh, okay, yeah, one minute.
No, right now. We're leaving.

48:37.373 --> 48:39.544
Are you even sober enough to drive?
I'm fine.

48:39.706 --> 48:42.547
Or I could give you a ride.
Just mind your business, Dan.

48:42.706 --> 48:44.343
Okay. You know what I think?

48:45.007 --> 48:47.451
I think that you know my name is actually Dave.

48:47.607 --> 48:50.210
Kind of like how I know yours is actually Dick.

48:51.741 --> 48:53.548
Ow. It's fine. I'm okay. I'm okay.

48:53.707 --> 48:57.516
I'll gonna kill this bitch. I'll kick the living
shit out of you. The living shit, my friend.

48:57.675 --> 49:00.017
You pretentious little
Belle and Sebastian...

49:00.176 --> 49:03.120
Whoa, little man.
Stop! Everyone, just calm down.

49:03.276 --> 49:04.878
Behave.
I wanna make him cry.

49:05.042 --> 49:06.384
All right, Ronny.
Chill.

49:06.543 --> 49:09.714
I've never done this before,
but I'm gonna kick your ass.

49:09.876 --> 49:12.945
That's right. I'm not kidding, buddy.
What are you people doing in here?

49:13.110 --> 49:15.349
I told you, living room is off-limits.
We're leaving.

49:15.510 --> 49:16.579
Good.
Yeah, good.

49:16.744 --> 49:19.950
Wait, what? You're leaving?
I'm gonna go with him.

49:20.111 --> 49:21.782
Ronny.

49:21.944 --> 49:23.047
Goodbye.

49:25.778 --> 49:27.949
Whatever. We shouldn't even be here.

49:28.112 --> 49:32.113
We should not even be here.
Children.

49:37.046 --> 49:40.717
You okay? Somebody said
you were in a fight or something.

49:40.879 --> 49:42.653
Not quite.

49:44.046 --> 49:48.491
Well, I am a little tipsy. Heh.

49:51.914 --> 49:53.950
Yes, I am.

50:01.549 --> 50:03.823
Thank you.
Yeah.

50:07.082 --> 50:10.617
Hey, so that girl, your friend,

50:10.783 --> 50:13.260
she's super cute, right?

50:13.416 --> 50:15.690
Yeah, super cute.

50:16.583 --> 50:20.118
Is she still here?
No, they left.

50:20.284 --> 50:23.421
Right. With her boyfriend.

50:23.584 --> 50:26.188
Who is a hottie, by the way.

50:28.385 --> 50:30.260
Not that that's...

50:31.385 --> 50:34.386
Well, I don't care about
that kind of stuff anymore.

50:35.052 --> 50:38.826
I am over boys.
They all suck. Heh.

50:39.252 --> 50:41.594
Especially the hotties.
Heh.

50:41.753 --> 50:45.527
Yeah, you've said that before.
Many times.

50:45.686 --> 50:48.255
No, this time I mean it.

50:49.554 --> 50:52.361
Last night I did the stupidest thing ever.

50:52.520 --> 50:57.625
I was so wasted, and we couldn't stop
laughing about this thing.

50:58.855 --> 51:02.628
Anyway, the cops showed up, and he
asked me if I needed a ride home...

51:02.788 --> 51:04.766
Do you know what "homogenized" means?

51:07.589 --> 51:10.362
What?
Homogenized.

51:12.589 --> 51:13.999
Uh...

51:14.356 --> 51:16.891
It's a kind of milk, isn't it?

51:17.056 --> 51:19.398
Homogenized milk.

51:21.357 --> 51:23.028
Yeah.

51:24.624 --> 51:26.124
Yeah.

51:28.491 --> 51:30.799
What's going on with you?

51:31.624 --> 51:33.102
Something's weird.

51:35.158 --> 51:37.534
You know what? I'm just feeling...

51:43.493 --> 51:44.527
What?

51:46.393 --> 51:48.269
Jane...

51:49.327 --> 51:50.963
Janey...

51:54.427 --> 51:56.234
I. M 9 o n n a 9 o

51:58.395 --> 52:00.304
What?

52:00.462 --> 52:02.371
But I was just telling you about...

52:02.894 --> 52:04.895
Don't you wanna talk?

52:05.062 --> 52:06.835
No, not tonight.

52:07.728 --> 52:09.070
I'll see you on Monday, okay?

52:11.862 --> 52:13.499
Okay.

52:15.463 --> 52:17.442
<i>You dig me.</i>

52:17.596 --> 52:21.439
"You dig me"? Oh, my God.
What, was that supposed to be cute?

52:21.597 --> 52:25.041
Yeah. Yes, it was. Yep.
Those were my intentions.

52:25.198 --> 52:29.903
Those were my intentions. Did she buy it?
Nope. Mm-mm-mm. No, sir.

52:30.064 --> 52:31.633
How could she?

52:31.798 --> 52:35.742
"You dig me." Who...? Nobody...
I've never heard anyone say that.

52:35.898 --> 52:37.637
God, that's... Ugh.

52:38.632 --> 52:39.666
God.

52:39.833 --> 52:42.606
<i>The things we used to do</i>

52:43.866 --> 52:47.810
<i>When the nightmare wouldn't end</i>

52:55.567 --> 52:58.637
<i>Turn up the sight of you</i>

52:59.935 --> 53:03.845
<i>And feel it all again</i>

53:11.569 --> 53:13.877
<i>The posters on the wall</i>

53:14.036 --> 53:15.446
I broke up with Ronny.

53:15.603 --> 53:18.740
<i>That were our only friends</i>

53:18.903 --> 53:20.608
I didn't do it for you.
I know.

53:20.770 --> 53:23.112
But it's totally your fault.
Right.

53:23.270 --> 53:27.476
You know, this doesn't mean that I can
jump into some relationship with you.

53:27.938 --> 53:28.972
Okay.

53:29.138 --> 53:32.604
I mean, I don't even know
if I'm gonna feel this way tomorrow.

53:33.405 --> 53:37.679
Well, I guess, then, we're just gonna
have to drive around all night.

53:39.705 --> 53:41.580
I could be into that.

53:44.239 --> 53:47.308
<i>Let's go out tonight</i>

53:48.006 --> 53:51.473
<i>And do something that's wrong</i>

53:51.940 --> 53:55.851
<i>'Cause I don't feel all right</i>

53:56.273 --> 53:59.513
<i>When disaster's gone</i>

54:00.274 --> 54:03.844
<i>Anne with an E</i>

54:04.007 --> 54:07.816
<i>You're everything to me</i>

54:17.442 --> 54:18.749
Oh, my God.

54:24.643 --> 54:27.985
Is that the same...?
Holy shit. From last night.

54:29.044 --> 54:30.919
Those kids.

54:42.212 --> 54:44.281
I think I might be sick.

55:01.881 --> 55:03.291
I'm sorry.

55:04.048 --> 55:09.322
Are you kidding me? Don't be. Never.
You never have to apologize to me.

55:19.583 --> 55:22.061
I don't know why I'm...

55:22.816 --> 55:24.260
Shit.

55:24.749 --> 55:26.557
It's scaly stuff.

55:27.550 --> 55:30.585
Sometimes everything seems really...

55:31.218 --> 55:32.991
harsh.

55:34.518 --> 55:37.052
I don't think I can handle it.

55:38.651 --> 55:42.857
Or I don't know if I'm gonna be...

55:43.619 --> 55:45.824
you know, strong enough...

55:46.686 --> 55:48.062
to be on my own.

55:48.385 --> 55:50.829
Oh, what?

55:50.986 --> 55:52.759
You will be.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.254
You are, you know. Trust me.

55:56.420 --> 55:58.398
And you're not gonna be on your own.

55:58.553 --> 56:02.793
I mean, you've got your family
and you've got...

56:30.224 --> 56:32.168
Okay.
Yeah.

56:32.324 --> 56:34.928
I should, um, really go inside now.

56:35.091 --> 56:37.160
I think you should too.
I'm going to.

56:37.325 --> 56:41.633
All right, then, go.
In a second. Don't rush me.

56:46.092 --> 56:48.660
So I'll call you tomorrow?
Yeah. Okay.

56:49.559 --> 56:51.161
Yeah. Heh.
Heh.

56:51.893 --> 56:53.098
Whew.

56:55.759 --> 56:57.634
Yeah. I mean, you don't have to.

56:57.793 --> 57:00.237
Or, like, don't go out of your way or anything.

57:01.494 --> 57:03.233
Okay.

57:03.393 --> 57:05.372
All right. Heh.

57:57.366 --> 57:59.208
Hi.
What are you doing?

57:59.366 --> 58:01.276
I thought you had so much calculus homework.

58:01.434 --> 58:04.469
I wasn't gonna bug you
for at least another 15 minutes.

58:04.634 --> 58:08.840
I'm taking a much-deserved break
Me too- I'm at the park with Stella-.

58:09.001 --> 58:12.070
We got big money riding
on this peewee baseball game.

58:12.235 --> 58:14.008
Yeah, maybe I could, um...

58:14.735 --> 58:17.508
You wanna come hang outwith us?
Meet the gerbil?

58:17.668 --> 58:22.170
Well, I don't wanna, like,
butt in on your time with your sister.

58:22.336 --> 58:26.246
No, are you kidding me? She's sick
to death of me. Come on. Here.

58:27.170 --> 58:29.170
Yes? Aubrey?

58:29.337 --> 58:32.178
Hi, this is Stella.
Hi.

58:32.337 --> 58:34.679
Can you please come to the park
and hang outwith us?

58:37.770 --> 58:42.078
We've never been apart for that long,
so it'll be an adjustment, definitely.

58:42.238 --> 58:46.614
I mean, but I'll be back all the time,
and she'll come out a lot.

58:47.172 --> 58:49.945
We'll make it work.
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

58:50.105 --> 58:52.583
Plus, we've still got
the whole summer. Ahem.

58:53.172 --> 58:57.015
She wants to go on a roller coaster.
She's obsessed with roller coasters.

58:57.173 --> 58:58.912
Where's her father?

58:59.640 --> 59:03.880
I mean, you don't have to tell me.
No, no. It's nothing that dramatic. Uh...

59:04.640 --> 59:06.777
We just don't really know.

59:06.940 --> 59:09.282
He had a drug problem. Uh...

59:10.307 --> 59:13.251
Got himself into debt, took off.

59:13.407 --> 59:15.249
It was a real mess. Ahem.

59:16.608 --> 59:18.814
The worst pan,

59:18.975 --> 59:23.613
Stella really liked him,
and he just completely bailed on her.

59:24.109 --> 59:26.610
That's pan of why it's hard, you know, leaving.

59:26.775 --> 59:30.185
I don't want her to worry
that I'm not gonna come back.

59:33.676 --> 59:35.586
Dave, it's...

59:37.877 --> 59:39.685
No, you're right.

59:40.244 --> 59:41.313
It'll be fine.

59:44.178 --> 59:46.816
What are you two talking about over here?

59:46.978 --> 59:50.422
We were talking about roller coasters.
I love roller coasters.

59:50.578 --> 59:53.613
Yeah? How do you know?
You've never even been on one yet.

59:58.479 --> 01:00:00.548
Hey, guys.
Oh, hey. I need your input.

01:00:00.746 --> 01:00:03.952
What do you think, with this dress,
the shawl or the jacket?

01:00:04.113 --> 01:00:05.648
Are you guys going somewhere?

01:00:05.814 --> 01:00:08.485
Nope. This is how we've decided
to start dressing around the house.

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:10.647
We're gonna have to insist that you do too.

01:00:10.814 --> 01:00:12.315
Every Sunday.
It'll be a regular thing.

01:00:12.481 --> 01:00:15.823
I've told you about this a hundred times.
Tonight's the benefit.

01:00:15.981 --> 01:00:17.516
The benefit.

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:20.488
The cancer center.
Your father is presenting an award.

01:00:20.648 --> 01:00:23.252
Are you ever listening to me
when I tell you these things?

01:00:23.415 --> 01:00:25.359
Right, the benefit.
That's tonight.

01:00:25.516 --> 01:00:28.051
Yes, it's tonight.
There's lasagna in the fridge.

01:00:28.216 --> 01:00:31.160
You should eat it,
because we're gonna be late, okay?

01:00:31.316 --> 01:00:33.658
Okay. And I'd, um...

01:00:33.817 --> 01:00:36.795
You know, I'd definitely go
with the jacket, no question.

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:40.622
As would I. Let's go.
Ah, coming. Good night.

01:00:40.783 --> 01:00:42.284
Night.

01:00:51.918 --> 01:00:53.021
So here's the thing.

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:58.487
My parents are gonna go to this benefit.
Benefits are cool.

01:00:58.652 --> 01:01:00.153
Uh...

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.921
Uh, you should come over.
Really?

01:01:05.087 --> 01:01:09.190
I mean, if you want to, you could...
Do you want to?

01:01:09.354 --> 01:01:13.958
Yes. I mean, I guess. Sure.
Uh, when-ish?

01:01:14.121 --> 01:01:15.621
Like 45 minutes-ish?

01:01:15.787 --> 01:01:17.696
Uh, no, that should work for me.
Good.

01:01:17.854 --> 01:01:18.888
Great.
Bye.

01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:20.464
Bye.

01:01:28.922 --> 01:01:30.423
No.

01:01:31.322 --> 01:01:33.823
No, because you're not that guy.

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:37.633
You're not that guy who walks around
with a condom in his wallet.

01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:39.826
You're not.

01:02:07.126 --> 01:02:09.866
Can I put this down in your room?
It's deceptively heavy.

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:11.130
Mm-hm.
Thanks.

01:02:19.461 --> 01:02:21.871
What you got in there?
Oh, I got you something.

01:02:22.028 --> 01:02:23.335
Uh, it's nothing.

01:02:23.495 --> 01:02:27.667
You know,
it's just like getting you flowers or...

01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:31.705
Or... I would never get you flowers though
because I know how you feel about cheesiness.

01:02:31.862 --> 01:02:34.204
I'm not opposed to flowers.
I like flowers. They're pretty.

01:02:34.363 --> 01:02:37.001
Oh. Okay. Huh.

01:02:37.163 --> 01:02:39.800
Well, now I know that. Um, wow.

01:02:39.963 --> 01:02:42.339
I should have got you, like,
a whole box of flowers.

01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:44.600
You shouldn't have gotten me anything.

01:02:44.764 --> 01:02:48.334
Well, after the park, I took Stella
to this really cool store off Scottsdale

01:02:48.497 --> 01:02:50.998
where, um, I used to go in
all the time because I would get...

01:02:51.164 --> 01:02:53.938
I used to have this
antique-action-figure collection. Uh...

01:02:54.665 --> 01:02:58.632
I don't know why I'm telling you about
my action-figure collection, but any...

01:03:04.666 --> 01:03:09.133
I thought you could cut them up.
You know, for collage.

01:03:16.234 --> 01:03:20.269
You are just completely ridiculous.

01:03:20.434 --> 01:03:24.970
I know. I know. It was stupid.
Uh, I just...

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:28.579
I don't know why I brought that.
I just... I thought maybe...

01:03:28.735 --> 01:03:31.373
You probably have a whole system for that.

01:03:31.936 --> 01:03:33.936
I dig you so much.

01:03:54.138 --> 01:03:57.309
So much it, like, freaks me out.

01:03:57.772 --> 01:03:59.647
I told you.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.977
I want you to hear this song
I downloaded last night.

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:18.880
I was maybe gonna put it on a
with some other stuff for your car.

01:04:19.374 --> 01:04:22.319
Like a mix?
No, not like a mix, just...

01:04:28.075 --> 01:04:30.484
<i>Girl come to me in a dream</i>

01:04:33.909 --> 01:04:36.979
<i>And I don't even know her name</i>

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:43.454
<i>A pretty mark upon her breast</i>

01:04:45.844 --> 01:04:49.050
<i>To signify her from the rest</i>

01:04:50.744 --> 01:04:51.983
So, what do you wanna do?

01:04:52.144 --> 01:04:55.486
<i>But her and I are just the same</i>

01:04:55.645 --> 01:04:58.418
Well, there's some lasagna.
Are you hungry?

01:04:58.578 --> 01:05:00.817
- Are you?
- No.

01:05:00.978 --> 01:05:02.718
Me neither.

01:05:03.779 --> 01:05:05.552
Okay.

01:05:06.312 --> 01:05:07.984
We could, um...

01:05:09.879 --> 01:05:13.790
- We could watch a movie.
- Well, I've actually seen all the movies.

01:05:13.947 --> 01:05:16.652
I'm pretty sure there's quite a few movies.

01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:19.052
I'm pretty sure I've seen them all.

01:05:19.214 --> 01:05:21.351
Okay, then, that's out.

01:05:21.915 --> 01:05:24.893
<i>I know it won't be easy</i>

01:05:28.015 --> 01:05:32.619
<i>What a thing to believe</i>

01:05:32.782 --> 01:05:34.192
We could go for a ride.

01:05:34.348 --> 01:05:37.758
Yeah, we could.
We could definitely do that.

01:05:37.916 --> 01:05:40.451
Or, you know, not,

01:05:40.616 --> 01:05:44.060
because we'll probably just
end up coming back here.

01:05:44.217 --> 01:05:47.457
Yeah, so, what's the point?

01:05:48.017 --> 01:05:49.723
We could play a game.

01:05:49.884 --> 01:05:54.760
You know, like Chutes and Ladders or Boggle.

01:05:56.618 --> 01:05:59.118
I'd wipe the floor with you if we played Boggle.

01:05:59.285 --> 01:06:00.627
Seriously, I'm amazing.

01:06:00.785 --> 01:06:04.524
I could have gone pro
if I hadn't blown out my knee.

01:06:04.685 --> 01:06:07.254
<i>The letter slipped
Right through my hands</i>

01:06:09.953 --> 01:06:13.159
<i>Practiced all my wit and charm</i>

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.455
<i>Had many girls on every arm</i>

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:21.064
I don't really feel like playing games, do you?

01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:22.892
Not really.

01:06:23.488 --> 01:06:24.522
Okay.

01:06:25.154 --> 01:06:27.325
So, what do you wanna do?

01:06:29.354 --> 01:06:31.026
Really.

01:06:39.489 --> 01:06:41.092
What?

01:06:42.023 --> 01:06:45.524
What? What are you...?
What are you thinking?

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:51.628
Uh, I'm son of thinking that, um...
What?

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:56.758
I'm thinking that this has just been like...

01:06:58.058 --> 01:07:00.558
the best weekend of my life.

01:07:05.759 --> 01:07:09.499
And I don't wanna do anything
that might screw it up.

01:07:11.226 --> 01:07:12.761
Oh.

01:07:13.526 --> 01:07:15.128
Um...

01:07:15.293 --> 01:07:18.533
Yeah. No, you're right.

01:07:18.693 --> 01:07:20.535
I am?

01:07:20.694 --> 01:07:23.638
Yeah. Yeah. You're totally right.

01:07:24.861 --> 01:07:29.203
Yeah, we should just, you know,
take things slow, not rush things.

01:07:29.361 --> 01:07:31.964
You know, we don't wanna be cliche
Yeah, cliches are the worst.

01:07:32.128 --> 01:07:35.538
Those people who are like, "Ah, those
teenagers with their raging hormones.

01:07:35.695 --> 01:07:39.798
They can't control themselves." It's like, come on.
Yes, we can control ourselves.

01:07:39.962 --> 01:07:42.839
Such bullshit. We are not bunnies.
We are absolutely not bunnies.

01:07:42.996 --> 01:07:45.974
We are capable of making intelligent,
rational decisions.

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:49.074
I think we're making one right now.
We are. This is good. This is better.

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:51.708
Way better. I'm glad you agree.
I totally agree.

01:07:51.864 --> 01:07:54.398
Good. Me too.

01:07:58.431 --> 01:08:00.568
Aw, fuck it.

01:08:09.799 --> 01:08:13.436
<i>I know it won't be easy</i>

01:08:15.732 --> 01:08:18.336
<i>What a thing to believe</i>

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.841
Oh, uh... Uh...

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.410
Should I...?
Okay, what?

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:28.804
Uh, I don't know...
Uh, well, what do you, uh, like?

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.307
Oh, um... Well, did you...
Did you bring a condom?

01:08:34.335 --> 01:08:37.643
No. Shit.
No, no. That's good. That's cool.

01:08:37.801 --> 01:08:40.871
That means that you didn't think that I
thought we were gonna have sex tonight.

01:08:41.036 --> 01:08:42.638
It's cooler that you didn't think that.

01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:47.178
Yeah, heh, no. I definitely didn't think that at all.
Uh, never even crossed my mind.

01:08:47.336 --> 01:08:49.336
I have one.

01:08:49.502 --> 01:08:51.072
What?
A condom.

01:08:51.237 --> 01:08:53.180
Huh?
Should I get it?

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:55.781
You could. I mean, sure. Yeah.
Okay.

01:08:55.938 --> 01:08:59.746
That's a thing you could do.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:03.673
That's a thing you could do.

01:09:06.537 --> 01:09:08.412
Holy shit.

01:09:20.673 --> 01:09:22.276
All right.

01:09:23.473 --> 01:09:25.178
Uh...
You can have it.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.078
This is for me.

01:09:31.374 --> 01:09:34.716
I think this is a really good kind.
Like maybe the best.

01:09:35.308 --> 01:09:38.014
I think this is what Tiger uses.

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:39.984
And it hasn't expired yet.

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:43.051
You know, still got a good
18 months on this guy.

01:09:43.207 --> 01:09:45.515
Not that I have that kind of stamina.

01:09:47.176 --> 01:09:49.518
Hey, "spermicide" is a really
ominous-sounding word, right?

01:09:49.676 --> 01:09:51.676
It sounds like something the Nazis committed.

01:09:51.843 --> 01:09:53.752
Are you gonna put it on?

01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:56.513
You mean right now?

01:09:56.677 --> 01:10:00.486
Or...
No, yeah, uh, yeah. Uh...

01:10:01.778 --> 01:10:05.313
Do you wanna get under the covers?
Yeah, heh, I do. That's a good idea.

01:10:05.477 --> 01:10:07.114
Good idea.

01:10:07.278 --> 01:10:08.846
Okay.

01:10:12.679 --> 01:10:13.884
Oh, uh...

01:10:15.346 --> 01:10:17.017
Okay.

01:10:18.046 --> 01:10:19.524
All right.

01:10:35.381 --> 01:10:40.053
Sorry. Sorry.
Guess I'm, uh, a little nervous.

01:10:41.915 --> 01:10:43.484
Well, um...

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:48.189
Do you want me to, uh, you know...?

01:10:48.749 --> 01:10:52.852
No, I'm okay. I'm good.
I actually think I almost got it.

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:54.426
Oh.
Uh... Heh.

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.687
Oh, good.
Thank you for the offer.

01:10:56.850 --> 01:10:58.259
Mm-hm.

01:11:06.284 --> 01:11:09.888
It's okay. Right there. Right there.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:10.385 --> 01:11:12.522
Sweet.

01:11:12.686 --> 01:11:15.926
Oh, okay. Uh...
Yeah. Heh.

01:11:17.919 --> 01:11:19.363
Ooh.

01:11:21.752 --> 01:11:23.321
Hey. Uh...

01:11:25.453 --> 01:11:29.330
No. I want this.

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:33.061
Me too.
Okay.

01:11:33.888 --> 01:11:35.422
Okay.

01:12:11.358 --> 01:12:15.496
Okay. Okay, no, no, no.
Okay.

01:12:16.025 --> 01:12:20.697
Don't wig out. Don't wig out.
Don't wig out.

01:12:20.859 --> 01:12:22.461
Okay.

01:12:26.493 --> 01:12:28.368
Don't wig out.

01:12:50.862 --> 01:12:53.340
At least the condom didn't break.

01:12:57.029 --> 01:13:00.997
I think that it can be better.

01:13:01.463 --> 01:13:06.340
You know, like, more fun.
Eventually.

01:13:07.064 --> 01:13:10.474
There's really no other direction it could go.

01:13:11.531 --> 01:13:13.100
Yeah.

01:13:14.398 --> 01:13:16.535
But it wasn't your fault.

01:13:18.066 --> 01:13:21.635
I didn't think it was.
It wasn't.

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:25.772
And it wasn't my fault either.

01:13:26.566 --> 01:13:28.976
Why? Do you think it's my fault?

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.234
Oh.
Hey, no.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:36.242
It's nobody's... It's nobody's fault, okay?
Look, uh, I just...

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.174
I heard that sometimes
people don't quite fit together.

01:13:40.335 --> 01:13:43.836
Hmm. And you think that that's us?
I don't know.

01:13:44.835 --> 01:13:47.870
But I don't think that's how
it was supposed to go. Uh...

01:13:48.035 --> 01:13:50.604
You know, even if you've never...

01:13:50.768 --> 01:13:52.747
It didn't feel right.

01:13:52.903 --> 01:13:56.711
Well, I mean, right? Did it?
It felt weird.

01:13:57.569 --> 01:13:58.808
It didn't feel good.

01:13:58.970 --> 01:14:01.948
I mean, maybe you weren't
turned on enough or something.

01:14:02.103 --> 01:14:06.378
I don't know how that shit works
or what's, like, normal, or...

01:14:06.837 --> 01:14:11.976
I mean, with guys, the equipment's
pretty self-explanatory, you know?

01:14:12.137 --> 01:14:15.445
But with girls, I just...
I had no idea it got so complicated.

01:14:15.605 --> 01:14:19.981
It's like you practically need a fricking
schematic and a flashlight just to...

01:14:20.138 --> 01:14:24.742
Okay. All right. Oh, my God.
I cannot believe that we just...

01:14:24.906 --> 01:14:27.975
I mean, I've only known you for,
what, like one weekend?

01:14:28.139 --> 01:14:32.379
Not even... Like 43 hours. I don't even
have a copy of your test results.

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:36.246
Test results?
I don't have test results. I'm a virgin.

01:14:36.407 --> 01:14:38.885
Or I was a minute ago.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.042
There are plenty of venereal diseases
you can get without intercourse.

01:14:44.442 --> 01:14:45.613
Okay.

01:14:45.774 --> 01:14:47.684
Okay, you know what?
This just...

01:14:47.842 --> 01:14:50.683
This happened really fast,

01:14:50.842 --> 01:14:54.286
and we got carried away and we made a mistake.

01:14:54.443 --> 01:14:57.387
And, you know, it's...
Look, it's not that big of a deal.

01:14:57.543 --> 01:14:59.350
Not the end of the world.

01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:03.686
Had to happen sooner or later, right?
So we just... We got it over with.

01:15:08.277 --> 01:15:11.517
Wow, I guess I'll just do about anything
to put off my calculus homework.

01:15:17.778 --> 01:15:21.779
Yeah, well, I should probably go.

01:15:22.945 --> 01:15:26.890
Or else I'm gonna have to jump off that
roof when your parents come home.

01:15:39.513 --> 01:15:41.583
I guess I'll call you later.

01:15:42.247 --> 01:15:43.725
Yeah.

01:15:50.382 --> 01:15:51.882
Wait.

01:15:54.248 --> 01:15:58.920
Uh, you know,
why don't I, uh...? Like, I'll...

01:16:00.816 --> 01:16:02.317
I'll call you.

01:16:02.483 --> 01:16:05.518
Because I've got a crazy few weeks
coming up with finals and everything,

01:16:05.683 --> 01:16:07.218
and also, Ronny keeps calling me

01:16:07.384 --> 01:16:09.691
and leaving these messages apologizing,

01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:12.590
so I don't even know what's gonna...

01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:15.558
You know, he said he wrote this song
that he wants me to hear and...

01:16:16.551 --> 01:16:19.052
Yeah, it's about your knees.
Enjoy that.

01:16:19.218 --> 01:16:21.560
And I know you wanna spend
as much time with your sister

01:16:21.719 --> 01:16:26.561
as possible this summer before
you leave for New York, so, um...

01:16:26.719 --> 01:16:30.061
So this probably isn't a great time
for you either.

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:32.197
To be getting into a...
Relationship.

01:16:32.353 --> 01:16:33.888
Anything.

01:16:37.153 --> 01:16:39.654
God. Just for the record,
I tried to stop it.

01:16:39.821 --> 01:16:41.799
All right? You practically...

01:16:41.954 --> 01:16:44.159
Practically what?

01:16:47.088 --> 01:16:50.760
No, nothing.
I'm sorry it happened.

01:16:53.022 --> 01:16:55.932
Yeah. Me too.

01:16:56.489 --> 01:16:59.797
All right, great. I guess I'll see you.
See you, Dave.

01:17:04.623 --> 01:17:06.862
<i>'Cause there's a red moon
Low in the sky</i>

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:09.433
<i>And a Santa Anna</i>

01:17:10.757 --> 01:17:15.224
<i>We are love
We are taken for granted</i>

01:17:17.157 --> 01:17:21.499
<i>I'm only here for this moment</i>

01:17:22.325 --> 01:17:27.702
<i>Siri Guru Daveh Nameh</i>

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.601
<i>The things they do to me</i>

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:44.461
<i>Are they trying to make me bleed?</i>

01:17:44.628 --> 01:17:49.595
<i>But I will never need them
Like they need me</i>

01:17:49.761 --> 01:17:55.104
<i>Siri Guru Daveh Nameh</i>

01:17:55.261 --> 01:17:56.705
Come on.

01:18:00.662 --> 01:18:01.765
Shit.

01:18:01.929 --> 01:18:06.465
<i>I wanna love you
I wanna love you</i>

01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:09.575
<i>I wanna love you</i>

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:13.004
<i>I wanna love you</i>

01:18:13.163 --> 01:18:16.630
<i>I wanna love you</i>

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:26.073
Hey, it's me. What are you doing?

01:18:30.799 --> 01:18:33.538
Sex. Sex.

01:18:34.733 --> 01:18:38.234
Here's what I know about sex.
You ready? You ready?

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.538
Sex is so much better

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.178
before you've had it.

01:18:45.334 --> 01:18:48.971
Because before you've had it, it's everything.

01:18:49.134 --> 01:18:51.112
You know?
It's what you dream of.

01:18:51.267 --> 01:18:56.178
I mean, your entire world is,
like, consumed in this...

01:18:56.335 --> 01:18:58.711
Well, you guys know what I'm talking about.

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:01.311
And then after...

01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:05.113
After, it's just...

01:19:05.269 --> 01:19:08.076
It's just sex.

01:19:08.703 --> 01:19:13.114
It's just... It's not even that, you know?
It's just a mess. It's a mess.

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:15.907
I wish I could just go back to the beginning.

01:19:17.037 --> 01:19:19.106
Beginning?
You mean Friday?

01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:22.275
Yeah, Friday.

01:19:22.437 --> 01:19:26.246
Seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?
I'd do it all different.

01:19:26.405 --> 01:19:28.508
All right. I'm gonna ask you
a serious question,

01:19:28.672 --> 01:19:31.411
and I want you to think about it
before you give me the answer.

01:19:31.572 --> 01:19:35.779
Is it possible that the problem
was that you're actually, like,

01:19:35.939 --> 01:19:37.611
huge?

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:42.377
And you've never realized it before because you've
never had anything to compare it to up close.

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.449
Would you like me to look at your penis?

01:19:44.607 --> 01:19:47.141
No. Trust me,
that's not the problem.

01:19:47.307 --> 01:19:49.751
You're sure? All right.
Positive.

01:19:56.274 --> 01:19:57.809
What?

01:19:57.975 --> 01:20:01.680
It's better this way.
It's better. Think about it.

01:20:01.842 --> 01:20:04.980
She doesn't go to our school so you're
not gonna run into her in the hallways.

01:20:05.142 --> 01:20:07.746
Nobody knows,
so nobody's gonna hear her version.

01:20:07.909 --> 01:20:11.410
And in a couple of weeks,
it'll be prom, then graduation,

01:20:11.577 --> 01:20:14.987
and before you know it, you're on a plane to.

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:17.815
So it was never gonna last anyway.

01:20:18.677 --> 01:20:21.383
And now it's done with.
And who knows, maybe years from now

01:20:21.544 --> 01:20:23.647
you'll bump into her somewhere,
you know, in some bar.

01:20:23.811 --> 01:20:27.017
You'll have a few drinks
and you'll laugh about it.

01:20:27.544 --> 01:20:30.421
And that's it. That's life.

01:20:30.579 --> 01:20:34.990
So the best thing to do is just let it go.
Let it go, David.

01:20:38.679 --> 01:20:40.123
I think that's bullshit.

01:20:40.279 --> 01:20:42.848
Oh, really? You do?
Total bullshit.

01:20:43.014 --> 01:20:46.288
You met somebody. Somebody
very cool, from the sound of it.

01:20:46.447 --> 01:20:48.981
How many weekends have we spent driving around

01:20:49.147 --> 01:20:50.955
looking for exactly that thing?

01:20:51.114 --> 01:20:54.354
And it never happens.
It never happens.

01:20:54.514 --> 01:20:56.493
But it did. So now what?

01:20:56.648 --> 01:20:57.955
You hit one bump and you bail?

01:20:58.115 --> 01:20:59.889
Throw your hands up and walk away?

01:21:00.048 --> 01:21:02.152
Well, I mean, it was a pretty major bump.

01:21:02.315 --> 01:21:04.623
No, it wasn't. It was sex.

01:21:04.782 --> 01:21:08.591
One time. The first time.
You don't know anything from that.

01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:11.591
You're gonna tell me you don't think
it's worth giving it one more shot?

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:14.785
You think it's about letting it go. No.

01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:17.224
It's about sticking with it and being a man.

01:21:17.384 --> 01:21:21.328
And I don't mean in no bullshit way,
like you're tough or you're a dick.

01:21:21.484 --> 01:21:24.088
Being a real man.
I don't even know if I am.

01:21:24.251 --> 01:21:28.423
You are. You're a man. Now act like it.

01:21:31.585 --> 01:21:33.222
All right, let me ask you this.

01:21:33.386 --> 01:21:36.387
A couple of days ago, you were all about Jane.

01:21:36.552 --> 01:21:38.030
You know, dear, sweet Janey.

01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:42.426
And now I just wanna know,
before we go full commando here,

01:21:42.586 --> 01:21:45.928
what is it that's so special
about this particular girl?

01:21:56.488 --> 01:21:57.989
Ugh.

01:21:59.122 --> 01:22:01.293
Oh, my God.
I'm so glad that you called.

01:22:01.455 --> 01:22:05.399
You are? Oh, baby,
I'm so glad you're glad I called.

01:22:05.555 --> 01:22:08.056
I just had to hear your voice,
my sweet girl's voice.

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:09.257
Ronny.

01:22:09.422 --> 01:22:11.594
This has been the darkest day of my life.

01:22:11.756 --> 01:22:14.200
I feel like I don't even know who I am anymore.

01:22:14.356 --> 01:22:17.198
Things have been so messed up lately,
all this negativity around me.

01:22:17.356 --> 01:22:21.801
Joel and Leon and my mom That judgmental bitch.

01:22:21.957 --> 01:22:25.458
Anyway, I guess I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry.

01:22:25.624 --> 01:22:30.228
So sorry. And I get it. I do.
You're not ready yet.

01:22:31.325 --> 01:22:34.303
What?
To have sex.

01:22:34.458 --> 01:22:37.335
And that's cool. I can wait.
No, I will wait for you.

01:22:37.492 --> 01:22:40.130
A month, or maybe even two.
Whatever it takes.

01:22:40.292 --> 01:22:44.293
It's late and I'm really tired.

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:47.063
I have to get up for school in like four hours.

01:22:47.227 --> 01:22:50.171
Is it that guy from last night?
Are you two, like, together now?

01:22:50.327 --> 01:22:52.236
What? No.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.832
We're definitely not together.

01:22:54.994 --> 01:22:57.835
I just... don't think I can have
this conversation right now.

01:22:58.294 --> 01:23:00.397
Sony. I just...

01:23:00.561 --> 01:23:03.539
No, I get it. You're tired.

01:23:03.695 --> 01:23:06.139
Sleep, baby girl. Dream.

01:23:06.295 --> 01:23:11.467
<i>I mean, just pf ease
do not break up with me, okay?</i>

01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:15.301
I mean, nobody gets me, I mean
really gets me, the way that you do.

01:23:15.463 --> 01:23:17.031
I love...

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.971
<i>Lead me on, lead me on</i>

01:23:46.066 --> 01:23:50.909
<i>Right now I just need something
You could be that one thing</i>

01:23:51.067 --> 01:23:53.738
<i>So lead me on</i>

01:23:57.601 --> 01:24:02.670
<i>Take me home, take me home</i>

01:24:02.834 --> 01:24:07.404
<i>I'll be yours till the morning
Then leave without warning</i>

01:24:07.568 --> 01:24:10.876
<i>So take me home</i>

01:24:22.504 --> 01:24:24.448
Slut.

01:24:31.171 --> 01:24:36.139
<i>Call me, please
Call me, please</i>

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:41.076
<i>I can't wait forever
You know better</i>

01:24:41.239 --> 01:24:44.080
<i>So call me, please</i>

01:24:44.239 --> 01:24:45.876
Morning.

01:24:47.939 --> 01:24:52.816
<i>Leave me be, leave me be</i>

01:24:53.206 --> 01:24:55.844
<i>You had your chance already</i>

01:24:56.007 --> 01:24:57.951
<i>Someone else, I go steady
So leave me be</i>

01:24:58.107 --> 01:25:01.574
Are you all right?
Yeah.

01:25:14.043 --> 01:25:15.248
I met a boy.

01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:24.584
A really good one.
And I think I drove him away.

01:25:26.743 --> 01:25:28.585
Honey, I'm sure you didn't.

01:25:29.411 --> 01:25:33.254
No, I did. I messed up.

01:25:33.411 --> 01:25:36.049
And now it's over before I...

01:25:37.211 --> 01:25:38.848
I'm never gonna see him again.

01:25:40.311 --> 01:25:42.789
Oh, sweetheart.

01:25:45.146 --> 01:25:47.090
I love you.

01:25:49.047 --> 01:25:52.287
Both of you. So much.

01:25:52.446 --> 01:25:55.584
And I'm sorry if I don't tell you it more.

01:26:00.514 --> 01:26:03.152
Anyways, I should go before I miss the bus.

01:26:03.314 --> 01:26:06.019
You want me to drive you?
Maybe talk about it?

01:26:06.615 --> 01:26:09.616
No. I son of feel like
taking the bus.

01:26:17.716 --> 01:26:21.217
I want you to remember every detail
of what just happened,

01:26:21.749 --> 01:26:24.023
because it's never going to happen again.

01:26:32.551 --> 01:26:33.960
Okay, here's what it is.
Whoa. F...

01:26:34.985 --> 01:26:36.860
Uh...
Oh, shit.

01:26:37.951 --> 01:26:39.826
I'm sorry.
You.

01:26:39.985 --> 01:26:43.986
You gotta, like, give a girl some
warning or something when you do that.

01:26:44.152 --> 01:26:48.120
I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I should have. I just, um...

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:50.355
It's just that I've been thinking.

01:26:52.986 --> 01:26:54.987
I don't know much about relationships.

01:26:56.887 --> 01:26:58.456
Neither do I.

01:26:59.554 --> 01:27:01.929
I definitely don't know anything about love.

01:27:02.087 --> 01:27:04.861
I can't believe I talked like I did.

01:27:05.021 --> 01:27:06.124
I don't.

01:27:07.788 --> 01:27:12.597
All I want, like, in the world,
is to just keep talking to you.

01:27:12.755 --> 01:27:16.393
I wanna know how your day was,
where you wanna eat,

01:27:16.555 --> 01:27:18.965
and I wanna argue with you.

01:27:19.122 --> 01:27:21.100
And I wanna hear all your theories,

01:27:21.256 --> 01:27:24.962
even the ones that are just
completely, you know, wrong.

01:27:25.123 --> 01:27:28.329
And I know it's not that simple.
I don't know, I just think...

01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:32.628
No, I really believe
that if you'd just be willing

01:27:32.791 --> 01:27:35.667
to continue having this conversation with me,

01:27:36.591 --> 01:27:38.660
then we can figure the rest out.

01:27:44.958 --> 01:27:47.493
I'm gonna be late for school.

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:53.436
All right.

01:27:53.893 --> 01:27:57.099
All right. Yeah.
Do you wanna give me a ride?

01:27:58.093 --> 01:27:59.537
Uh...

01:28:00.527 --> 01:28:03.096
Yeah.
It's not gonna make you late?

01:28:03.261 --> 01:28:05.500
So I'm late.
What are they gonna do, right? Heh.

01:28:30.364 --> 01:28:32.603
Wow.
Oh, sorry. That's... Wrong song.

01:28:34.364 --> 01:28:37.138
Nope, not that one either.
Here, this one. This one's good.

01:28:38.198 --> 01:28:40.005
<i>Whirlwind, run</i>

01:28:43.165 --> 01:28:44.905
<i>Further and further away</i>

01:28:45.065 --> 01:28:48.101
You know, none of my theories
are wrong, by the way.

01:28:48.266 --> 01:28:51.039
They just aren't fully developed yet.

01:28:51.199 --> 01:28:52.404
Okay.

01:28:52.566 --> 01:28:55.100
And as far as what you said before

01:28:55.266 --> 01:28:58.336
about wanting to keep talking,

01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:00.738
I'm obviously...

01:29:02.067 --> 01:29:04.170
totally into that.

01:29:07.767 --> 01:29:09.938
But I would also like to work on the sex thing.

01:29:11.902 --> 01:29:13.573
Definitely.

01:29:13.735 --> 01:29:16.009
We can definitely work
on the sex thing. Heh.

01:29:16.169 --> 01:29:19.772
I actually had a few ideas about that.
Me too.

01:29:19.935 --> 01:29:21.811
So, you know?
Yeah.

01:29:21.969 --> 01:29:24.708
<i>How would you cope
If the world decided</i>

01:29:24.869 --> 01:29:27.642
<i>To make you suffer
For all that you were?</i>

01:29:29.203 --> 01:29:31.340
<i>How could you dance if...?</i>

01:29:35.304 --> 01:29:38.441
Okay.
Wait.

01:29:48.539 --> 01:29:52.006
You're ridiculous.
Well, deal with it.

01:29:54.073 --> 01:29:56.880
Hey, what's up?
Hey, Chase.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.545
So...?

01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:02.974
So, what?

01:30:06.174 --> 01:30:09.516
So do you wanna pick me up after school?

01:30:11.108 --> 01:30:13.984
What time?
Well, jazz band practice ends at 4.

01:30:14.141 --> 01:30:17.551
If you make a crack about the fact that
I'm in jazz band, you're gonna regret it.

01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:19.119
I'll be right here.

01:30:19.275 --> 01:30:20.651
Cool.
Good.

01:30:24.409 --> 01:30:27.785
All right, then.
Yeah. So...

01:30:27.943 --> 01:30:28.977
I should go.

01:30:29.143 --> 01:30:32.677
Yeah, right.
Because first period...

01:30:32.843 --> 01:30:34.150
Yeah.

01:30:35.343 --> 01:30:37.049
Okay- Okay

01:30:39.078 --> 01:30:41.283
Later, Hodgman.
Heh. Later.

01:31:04.547 --> 01:31:07.991
<i>And everybody probably thinks
I'm crazy</i>

01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:13.491
<i>Well, I'll just tell you now
That I fell in love</i>

01:31:13.648 --> 01:31:18.423
<i>And I couldn't help myself</i>

01:31:18.848 --> 01:31:21.452
<i>I just fell in love</i>

01:31:21.615 --> 01:31:27.390
<i>And I couldn't help myself</i>

01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:35.355
<i>It was like a movie
Watching her eyes read</i>

01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:43.585
<i>What! Wrote made sweet Louise
Feel weak in her knees</i>

01:31:44.285 --> 01:31:47.320
<i>And I thought that everyone
Would know by now</i>

01:31:48.218 --> 01:31:52.162
<i>I've been alive long enough
To know how things just get around</i>

01:31:52.318 --> 01:31:56.320
<i>And everybody probably thinks
I'm crazy</i>

01:31:56.486 --> 01:32:01.430
<i>Well I'll just tell you now
That I fell in love</i>

01:32:01.586 --> 01:32:06.395
<i>And I couldn't help myself</i>

01:32:06.554 --> 01:32:09.395
<i>I just fell in love</i>

01:32:09.554 --> 01:32:14.726
<i>And I couldn't help myself</i>

01:32:14.887 --> 01:32:18.422
<i>In that moment</i>

01:32:18.588 --> 01:32:23.055
<i>You knew from her eyes</i>

01:32:24.022 --> 01:32:26.762
<i>She don't feel the same</i>

01:32:27.489 --> 01:32:34.367
<i>But, oh, my words
Were not in vain</i>

01:32:34.523 --> 01:32:39.263
<i>'Cause I can always say
Till the day I die</i>

01:32:39.423 --> 01:32:44.266
<i>That!
I told her anyway</i>

01:32:44.424 --> 01:32:49.391
<i>Well, I'll just tell you now
That I fell in love</i>

01:32:49.558 --> 01:32:54.367
<i>And I couldn't help myself</i>

01:32:54.525 --> 01:32:57.401
<i>I just fell in love</i>

01:32:57.559 --> 01:33:02.334
<i>And I couldn't help myself</i>

01:33:02.493 --> 01:33:05.334
<i>I just fell in love</i>

01:33:05.493 --> 01:33:10.336
<i>And I couldn't help myself</i>

01:33:10.494 --> 01:33:13.335
<i>I just fell in love</i>

01:33:13.494 --> 01:33:20.337
<i>And I couldn't help myself</i>

01:33:23.495 --> 01:33:24.996
<i>"I just fell in love"</i>

01:33:25.305 --> 01:33:31.187
