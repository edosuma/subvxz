WEBVTT

00:23.490 --> 00:27.085
- JEEZ, CHAVO, YOU LOOK
LIKE A GIANT BABY ON FILM.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.758
MAKE SURE THAT
LITTLE RED LIGHT'S BLINKING.

00:28.790 --> 00:31.350
- THANK YOU FOR THAT
AMAZING ADVICE.

00:31.390 --> 00:33.221
- THANK YOU FOR BEING
SO SARCASTIC.

00:33.260 --> 00:34.557
- TAKE IT EASY.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.303
- READY?

00:44.340 --> 00:47.173
I AM CURRENTLY STANDING
LESS THAN 200 METERS

00:47.210 --> 00:50.373
FROM WHERE CHAVO HERE COWERED
LIKE A BITCH IN A BUSH,

00:50.410 --> 00:52.742
BUT SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO GET A PICTURE

00:52.780 --> 00:55.112
OF THIS THING'S RIGHT CALF
AND BU'I'I'OCK

00:55.150 --> 00:56.378
BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED
INTO THE BUSH.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.115
- AND HERE'S A FACT:
IF I GO DOWN,

00:58.150 --> 00:59.515
YOU'RE LIKE A DOG
WITHOUT A BONE, CHICA.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.778
- DUDE, I WOULD PICK UP
THAT CAMERA AND FORGE AHEAD

01:01.820 --> 01:03.481
LIKE DENZEL PICKED UP THE FLAG
IN GLORY.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.486
THERE HAVE BEEN A SPATE
OF RECENT SIGHTINGS

01:05.530 --> 01:07.350
OF WHAT HAS LOCALLY
GAINED TRACTION

01:07.400 --> 01:10.119
AS A BIGFOOT-TYPE CREATURE.
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.819
- YEAH, SHOW THEM
THE TRANSMITTER.

01:11.870 --> 01:16.261
- WE HAVE PLANTED A NUMBER
OF THESE MOTIVATIONAL DEVICES

01:16.310 --> 01:19.131
IN ORDER TO ENTICE
OUR FAVORITE SQUATCH

01:19.180 --> 01:21.136
INTO GIVING US
A LITTLE ENCORE.

01:21.180 --> 01:22.499
CALM DOWN, CHAVO.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.370
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE
DARK MEAT AND TECHNOLOGY.

01:24.410 --> 01:27.379
- CAREFUL, THAT'S
A $200 TRACKING DEVICE IN THERE.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.547
[raspy grunting, wheezing]

01:29.590 --> 01:31.285
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

01:31.320 --> 01:33.311
- WOULD YOU STOP IT?
THAT IS A RIDICULOUS SOUND.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.554
- FORGET YOU, SHAWN.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.251
YOU KNOW I'M ALLERGIC
TO PINE NEEDLES

01:36.290 --> 01:38.451
AND MOST TYPES OF DIRT.
PLUS, IT'S RAINING NOW.

01:38.490 --> 01:40.549
IF I DON'T START SMELLING
SLOW-ROASTING BRISKET

01:40.600 --> 01:42.192
IN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES,
WE'RE TURNING AROUND.

01:42.230 --> 01:44.391
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
SHAWN FRIGGING SPENCER?

01:44.430 --> 01:46.796
YOU REALLY CAME.
THIS IS THE BOOBS.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.899
- UH, KATE FAVOR.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.862
WOW, YOU LOOK JUST LIKE
YOUR PICTURE ON THE BLOG SPOT.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.332
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A SCREEN CAP

01:52.380 --> 01:54.200
OF ANGELINA JOLIE
IN ORIGINAL SIN.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.845
- SHAWN, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE,
AND WHY DO THEY KNOW YOUR NAME?

01:56.880 --> 01:58.245
- WE KNOW YOUR NAME TOO,
POOTIE TANG.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.474
- WA DA TA.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.909
- OH, GUS, WE'RE JUST
JOKING WITH YOU

02:01.950 --> 02:03.417
BECAUSE YOU'RE SWEET ENOUGH
TO MELT

02:03.450 --> 02:04.519
AND DRIZZLE ON TWO SCOOPS
OF ME.

02:04.550 --> 02:07.348
THIS IS CHI-CHI--UH, CHAVO.

02:07.390 --> 02:08.618
HE HID IN A BUSH
WHEN HE HEARD YOU GUYS COMING

02:08.660 --> 02:10.252
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
YOU GUYS WERE BIGFOOT

02:10.290 --> 02:12.190
AND HE FORGOT TO TAKE
HIS MIDOL THIS MORNING.

02:12.230 --> 02:14.323
- OKAY, I WAS GOING
FOR A LOW, OMINOUS ANGLE,

02:14.360 --> 02:16.920
AND ALSO, I DON'T HAVE OVARIES.
- THAT'S DEBATABLE.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.859
- UH, BIGFOOT?
- YEAH, BIGFOOT.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.936
UH, DID SHAWN NOT TELL YOU
THE DEAL, OR--

02:21.970 --> 02:24.507
- WHAT DEAL? WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO THE SASSY QUATCH.

02:24.540 --> 02:26.633
IT'S A SECRET BARBECUE HUT
BUILT INTO THE SIDE OF A CAVE

02:26.680 --> 02:28.477
THAT ALMOST NOBODY
KNOWS ABOUT.

02:28.510 --> 02:31.877
IT HAS THE BEST TASTING
CORN PUDDING IN ALL OF--

02:31.910 --> 02:34.515
SHAWN, YOU SON OF A BITCH.
WHY DO YOU HAVE A CAMERA?

02:34.550 --> 02:37.280
- UH, WELL, BUDDY,
IF I'D TOLD YOU THE TRUTH,

02:37.320 --> 02:38.548
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE COME.

02:38.590 --> 02:40.410
HERE'S THE THING.
I, UH--I STUMBLED

02:40.460 --> 02:42.928
UPON KATE AND CHAVO'S BLOG
WHEN I WAS MESSING AROUND

02:42.960 --> 02:45.224
ON THE HARRY AND
THE HENDERSONS FAN SITE.

02:45.260 --> 02:46.454
TURNS OUT--
- SHAWN...

02:46.500 --> 02:48.252
JOHN LITHGOW
IS NEVER WRITING YOU BACK.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.528
HE'S NEVER EVEN HEARD
OF THAT SITE.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.424
- OKAY, THAT IS YOUR OPINION.
- LOOK.

02:51.470 --> 02:53.199
IF SHAWN CAN HELP US
FIND THE BEAST

02:53.240 --> 02:55.390
BY USING HIS GIFT, AND WE CAN
CATCH IT ALL ON CAMERA,

02:55.440 --> 02:58.238
WE WILL WIN
THE STUDENT ACADEMY AWARD.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.669
- DUDE, THE STUDENT
ACADEMY AWARD.

02:59.710 --> 03:02.372
- OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

03:02.410 --> 03:04.241
I WILL NOT GET EATEN
BY A BEAR

03:04.280 --> 03:06.578
TO PROVE THAT BIGFOOT
DOES NOT EXIST. NOPE.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.248
NO BEARS EATING ME.
NOT TODAY, NOT EVER.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.587
NOT EVEN IN YOUR DREAMS.
- OKAY.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.212
YOU JUST JINXED YOURSELF.
- SUCK IT, SHAWN.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.613
- AT LEAST STICK AROUND
AND LET US SHOW YOU

03:13.660 --> 03:15.548
THE BIGFOOT BLIND WE BUILT.
IT'S TOTALLY RAD.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.354
AND WE HAVE A MONDO STASH
OF BEEF JERKY THERE.

03:18.390 --> 03:21.325
- DUDE, THEY HAVE MEAT HERE.
- LOTS OF MEAT.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.396
- FINE. I WILL STAY
ONLY LONG ENOUGH

03:23.430 --> 03:25.364
TO REFUEL AND PUT SOMETHING
IN MY STOMACH.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.662
I'M FAMISHED,
AND I'M STARTING

03:26.700 --> 03:28.361
TO SEE FLOATING PROTOZOA
AND WHATNOT.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.731
- I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.658
- OKAY, GREAT.
CHI-CHI, WHY DON'T YOU, UH,

03:31.710 --> 03:34.372
GRAB SOME WOOD FOR THE FIRE AND
I'LL SHOW THE BOYS THE BLIND.

03:34.410 --> 03:36.002
ALMOST THERE, BOYS.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.543
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:38.580 --> 03:40.411
YOU THINK THAT'S
HER NATURAL GAIT?

03:40.450 --> 03:41.974
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.749
I'M SORRY I LIED, OKAY?
BUT LET'S BE HONEST.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.348
SHAME ON YOU FOR BELIEVING

03:45.390 --> 03:46.755
THERE WAS A PLACE
CALLED THE SASSY QUATCH

03:46.790 --> 03:48.451
BUILT INTO THE SIDE OF A CAVE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

03:48.490 --> 03:49.718
- MAN, YOU KNOW ALL I HEARD

03:49.760 --> 03:51.978
WERE THE KEY WORDS "DRY RUB"
AND "PONE."

03:52.030 --> 03:53.554
WHAT ARE WE DOING
OUT HERE, SHAWN?

03:53.600 --> 03:54.953
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO HELP THESE FOOLS.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.423
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.
HOLD UP.

03:57.470 --> 03:58.596
WE SHOULD BOTH
BE ON CAMERA FOR THIS.

03:58.630 --> 03:59.961
IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR STORY DRIVE.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.434
- WHAT?
- COME ON, DUDES.

04:02.470 --> 04:03.698
- WHAT IS MORE INTERESTING
THAN A DOCUMENTARY

04:03.740 --> 04:05.298
ABOUT FINDING BIGFOOT?

04:05.340 --> 04:06.637
- ANYTHING BUT
CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.671
- A DOCUMENTARY
ABOUT A DOCUMENTARY

04:08.710 --> 04:11.008
ABOUT FINDING BIGFOOT
THAT FAILS.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.779
- I WILL SLAP YOU
IN THE TEAT, SHAWN.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.744
- OH, THINK ABOUT IT, GUS.
THEY'RE MAKING DON QUIXOTE.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.418
WE'RE MAKING
LOST IN LA MANCHA.

04:17.450 --> 04:19.418
- OH, MY GOD.
- WE HAVE NEVER WON ANYTHING.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.654
ESPECIALLY YOU.

04:20.690 --> 04:21.782
NOW WHO DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA WIN

04:21.820 --> 04:23.356
THAT STUDENT ACADEMY AWARD NOW?

04:23.390 --> 04:26.723
HERE'S A HINT: US.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.625
NOW PULL OUT YOUR PHONE
AND START SHOOTING SOME B-ROLL.

04:28.660 --> 04:31.823
- COME ON, GUYS, CHOP-CHOP.
GUS TO THE WORLD.

04:31.870 --> 04:34.566
- HERE'S A NEWS FLASH, SHAWN:
WE ARE NOT STUDENTS.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.465
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE:
THIS IS THE WORST IDEA

04:36.510 --> 04:39.968
YOU'VE COME UP WITH
SINCE ODWALLAPALOOZA.

04:40.010 --> 04:43.673
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
ORGANIC JUICES AND WEIRD ELIXIRS

04:43.710 --> 04:45.473
THAT ARE ALIVE
ARE THE FUTURE, GUS.

04:45.510 --> 04:47.649
JUST LIKE MILK WAS THE FUTURE
BACK IN THE '505.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.511
AND "B," YESTERDAY,
I ENROLLED YOU

04:49.550 --> 04:51.518
IN SOMETHING CALLED
HERMENEUTICS AT UCSB.

04:51.550 --> 04:52.710
I THINK IT'S THE STUDY
OF THE MUNSTERS,

04:52.760 --> 04:53.818
SO WE SHOULD BE FINE.
- YOU DID NOT.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.452
- I SURE DID.

04:55.490 --> 04:57.378
- SHAWN, HERMENEUTICS
IS THE STUDY OF THEORY.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.421
- WELL, THAT FEELS REDUNDANT.
- OH, MY GOSH.

04:59.460 --> 05:02.054
I COULD HAVE AN EXAM ON FRIDAY.
I NEED TO FIND A SYLLABUS.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.829
- PRETTY DOPE
LITTLE SETUP, HUH?

HELPED YOURSELF, HUH?

05:09.370 --> 05:12.066
SO, KATE, WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH YOU AND CHAVO?

05:12.110 --> 05:14.704
IT'S JUST A
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP,

05:14.740 --> 05:16.776
OR ARE YOU GUYS
LOVERS IN THE NIGHTTIME?

05:16.810 --> 05:19.074
- MAN, I THINK WE SHOULD ALL
BE LOVERS IN THE NIGHTTIME.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.817

TOO POWERFUL TO BE GOVERNED

05:21.850 --> 05:26.458

05:48.480 --> 05:51.506

ALIVE, I WILL KILL YOU.

- WRONG.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.487
HE JUST CHANGED
INTO A GIANT DOG SUIT

07:05.520 --> 07:06.714

08:23.630 --> 08:25.291
- OH, I GOT IT.
AND THANK YOU.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.833
- OH, WAIT TILL YOU SEE IT,
BABY, OH, MY GOD.

08:27.870 --> 08:29.235
I AM SO TURNED ON
RIGHT NOW.

08:29.270 --> 08:30.305
- YEAH?
- YEAH, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.205
- WE WILL?
- YES.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.698
- ARE THEY GOING OFF TO DO
WHAT I THINK THEY'RE GONNA DO?

08:35.740 --> 08:36.877
- MAKE A NEW PLAN
BECAUSE WE'RE ON TO THEM?

08:36.910 --> 08:38.639
THEY BETTER.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.615
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S
WHAT THEY--OH, MY GOSH.

08:41.650 --> 08:44.187
SHAWN, I THINK SHE'S GOING TO--
SHE IS.

08:44.220 --> 08:48.111
- GUS, I NEED TO SNOOP
AROUND THIS TENT, OKAY?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.549
BE MY LOOKOUT.
- OKAY.

08:50.590 --> 08:54.196
- VIVA MEXICO, CHAVO.

08:54.230 --> 08:57.791
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

08:57.830 --> 08:59.195
HUH, THAT'S CLEVER.

08:59.230 --> 09:01.539
[distant moans, laughter]

09:03.270 --> 09:06.831
WHAT THE--

09:06.880 --> 09:10.202
THIS GIRL IS NOT
MESSING AROUND.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.275
WHAT IS--

09:12.310 --> 09:14.949
[grunting]

09:14.980 --> 09:16.811
WAIT A MINUTE,
WHO'S THE BIG DOT?

09:16.850 --> 09:19.284
I'M THE BIG DOT?
THEN WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

09:19.320 --> 09:21.914
[branches rustling]

09:21.960 --> 09:23.359
WHOA, WHOA!

09:23.390 --> 09:26.848
UM, GUS, WHAT'S
GOING ON OUT THERE, MAN?

09:26.900 --> 09:30.119
TALK TO ME, GUS.
GUS?

09:30.170 --> 09:31.865
DUDE, WHAT THE HECK?

09:31.900 --> 09:33.891
- IN A TREE.
CRAZY, RIGHT?

09:33.940 --> 09:35.931
IT'S STILL WARM.

09:35.970 --> 09:38.632
- I THINK THAT TURKEY LEG
WAS MEANT FOR BIGFOOT, GUS.

09:38.670 --> 09:40.206
SO THEY WENT TO THE TROUBLE
OF SETTING FOOD TRAPS

09:40.240 --> 09:41.730
WITH TRACKING DEVICES.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.179
MAN, THEY'RE REALLY
COMMITTING TO THIS HOAX.

09:43.210 --> 09:45.906
- WAIT, I SWALLOWED
A TRANSMITTER, SHAWN.

09:45.950 --> 09:48.612
WHAT IF MY BODY REJECTS
THE ALLOYS IN THE COMPOSITE?

09:48.650 --> 09:50.288
- YOU'LL POOP IT OUT, IT'S FINE.
- WHAT?

09:50.320 --> 09:52.880
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY
TO MAKE SOME CINEMATIC HISTORY?

09:52.920 --> 09:56.788
- GET RID
OF THAT THING!

09:56.830 --> 09:58.627
- I RARELY ORDER FLAN.

09:58.660 --> 10:00.628
IF IT'S THERE FOR THE TABLE,
SURE, I'LL PARTAKE,

10:00.660 --> 10:02.764
BUT CHANCES ARE, SOMETHING ELSE
ON THE MENU'S GONNA GRAB ME.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.620
- WELL, THEN YOU JUST
HAVEN'T HAD GOOD FLAN.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.399
- UH, GOOD FLAN, BAD FLAN.

10:06.430 --> 10:08.830
BOTTOM LINE:
IT'S EGGY. PERIOD.

10:08.870 --> 10:10.337
UGH.
- IT CAN BE EGGY.

10:10.370 --> 10:12.201
- OH, MAN, I SHOULD'VE PEED
BACK AT CAMP.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.639
MY MOLARS
ARE FLOATING.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.874
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
JUST MAKE IT QUICK.

10:14.910 --> 10:17.743
GIVE ME THE CAMERA.
[grunting]

10:17.780 --> 10:20.146
YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT THE BLADDER
OF A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL,

10:20.180 --> 10:21.647
BUT HE CAN HOLD MOST
OF THE TANTRIC POSITIONS

10:21.680 --> 10:22.817
FOR, LIKE,
45 FRIGGING MINUTES.

10:22.850 --> 10:24.249
- WOW, THAT'S SOMETHING.
- YES.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.848
WE HAVE TO GO TOO.
- YEAH, WE GOT TO PEE.

10:25.890 --> 10:27.858
WE ARE GONNA CATCH HIM
PUTTING ON THE COSTUME, GUS.

10:27.890 --> 10:29.926
WE'RE GONNA HIDE, WE'RE GONNA
GET THE WHOLE THING ON CAMERA,

10:29.960 --> 10:31.825
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
KEEP PLAYING ALONG.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.350
NOW PULL OUT YOUR PHONE
AND START SHOOTING.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.391
WE WANT AS MANY CHOICES
AS POSSIBLE IN THE EDITING ROOM.

10:35.430 --> 10:36.920
- YOU BET.
THIS IS ACTUALLY KIND OF FUN.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.259
- TRY AND GET
SOME GEOGRAPHY.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.199
- SHAWN?
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S PEEING.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.911
- WHERE IS THE BIG
FURRY DOG SUIT?

10:52.950 --> 10:54.941
- I'M FILMING A MAN
WHO'S PEEING, SHAWN.

10:54.980 --> 10:58.438
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.355
- WHO'S THERE?

11:00.390 --> 11:03.029
I'VE GOT PEPPER SPRAY
AND CHINESE THROWING STARS.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.358
I MEAN...
I'M--I'M A NINJA.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.291
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?
- WE HAD TO GO TOO.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.730
- WHAT--SO YOU JUST
LEFT KATE ALONE AT THE BLIND?

11:14.770 --> 11:15.896
- IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY
CAN SEE HER.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.237
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT
THE CONCEPT?

11:17.270 --> 11:18.737
IT'S A BLIND.

11:18.770 --> 11:20.237
GUS, YOU SHOULDN'T
HOLD IT LIKE THAT.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.838
YOU'RE GONNA GET BLACK BARS
ON BOTH SIDES.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.905
- OH, OH, RIGHT.
[Kate screams]

11:23.950 --> 11:29.809
- KATIE?

11:29.850 --> 11:31.989
- OH, HE SAW ME,
AND I SAW HIM!

11:32.020 --> 11:33.885
WE MADE EYE--EYE CONTACT.
- WHO SAW YOU?

11:33.920 --> 11:35.911
- WHO DO YOU THINK, CHAVO?
- WHAT THE--

11:35.960 --> 11:38.178
[creature growling]

11:38.230 --> 11:44.191
[all screaming]

11:44.230 --> 11:45.822
- AAH!
OH, MY GOD!

11:45.870 --> 11:47.758
OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

11:47.800 --> 11:49.199
OH, MY GOD!
OH, CRAP!

11:49.240 --> 11:50.434
OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

11:50.470 --> 11:52.904
OH, MY GOD!
- AAH!

11:52.940 --> 11:56.376
[grunting]

11:59.410 --> 12:02.311
- GUS, YOU OKAY?

12:02.350 --> 12:04.341
- I'M OKAY.
I'M OKAY!

12:04.390 --> 12:06.858
AAH!

12:06.890 --> 12:08.448
- GUS!

12:08.490 --> 12:10.424
- [panting]

12:11.990 --> 12:14.390
- I-I CAN'T SAY
I FEEL 100% RIGHT NOW, SHAWN.

12:14.430 --> 12:15.397
- WE LOST THE MONSTER
AND EVERYONE LIVED.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.829
EVEN CHAVO.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.292
- WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

12:18.330 --> 12:19.297
- HEY, I'VE GOT SOME ROPE
IN MY BACKPACK.

12:19.330 --> 12:20.797
- I GOT A FLASHLIGHT.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.831
SO WHAT, AM I FODDER HERE?
I'M EXPENDABLE?

12:22.870 --> 12:25.031
- HANG ON, NUTELLA.
- DON'T WORRY, GUS.

12:25.070 --> 12:26.503
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE
IN THE CATACOMBS.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.304
[chuckling]
- CATCH THE FLASHLIGHT, GUS.

12:29.340 --> 12:34.277
- [panting]

12:37.350 --> 12:42.287
- WHOA.
- EW.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.548
-AAH!

12:43.590 --> 12:45.455
- I TAKE THAT BACK, GUS.

12:45.490 --> 12:47.458
YOU'RE IN, LIKE,
A MINIATURE VERSION

12:47.500 --> 12:49.491
OF THE CATACOMBS.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.539
- AH! IT STINGS.
- TELL YOU WHAT.

12:55.570 --> 12:57.435
LATER ON,
YOU CAN PUT ONE ON ME,

12:57.470 --> 12:59.404
AND THEN RIP IT OFF
SUPER HARD.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.101
- KATE...

13:01.140 --> 13:04.075
YOU'RE VERY OPEN AND SENSUAL
AND EUROPEAN-SEEMING.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.169
- I GREW UP ON A COMMUNE--
- THAT'S AWESOME.

13:06.210 --> 13:08.349
BUT I'M IN A FULLY
COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP,

13:08.380 --> 13:10.439
AND MY LADY
AND HER ILLEGITIMATE SON,

13:10.490 --> 13:12.515
THEY COUNT ON ME
TO MAKE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS

13:12.550 --> 13:14.051
IN THE CLUTCH.

13:14.090 --> 13:17.150
- THAT MAKES ME SAD.
AND ALSO REALLY HOT.

13:17.190 --> 13:19.579
- HEY, UH, I DON'T MEAN
TO SET OFF ANY ALARMS HERE,

13:19.630 --> 13:21.359
BUT AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S TROUBLED

13:21.400 --> 13:23.129
BY THE THREE CORPSES
IN THE HOLE?

13:23.170 --> 13:24.489
- IT SEEMS PRETTY
CUT AND DRY TO ME.

13:24.530 --> 13:26.168
WE FOUND BIGFOOT'S
PRIVATE PANTRY.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.498
NOW WE'VE JUST GOT TO GO BACK
AND WAIT FOR SNACK TIME.

13:28.540 --> 13:29.939
- OR WE COULD BE SNACK TIME.

13:29.970 --> 13:31.938
UH-UH, NOPE,
NOT TODAY.

13:31.970 --> 13:33.608
SHAWN AND I
WILL BE LEAVING NOW.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.608
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
IT'S BEEN REAL.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.970
THE STUFF WE'RE GETTING IS EPIC.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE HISTORY.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.544
- NOPE.
[rustling in bushes]

13:41.580 --> 13:43.411
HE'LL WANT ME FIRST.
I'M THE SWEETEST.

13:43.450 --> 13:45.088
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
HE'S GONNA START WITH DESSERT?

13:45.120 --> 13:48.578
- OOH, GOOD POINT, MAYBE NOT.
CHAVO'S TOAST THOUGH.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.056
- SON OF A BITCH.
- LASSIE? JULES?

13:52.090 --> 13:53.990
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED
TO SEE YOU EVER.

13:54.030 --> 13:56.055
COME ON, HUG IT OUT.
HUG IT OUT.

13:56.100 --> 13:58.489
- I WOULD RATHER SPEND ALL DAY
AT THE MALL WITH MCNAB.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.066
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

14:00.100 --> 14:01.533
- WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

14:01.570 --> 14:02.639
WE GOT A CALL
FROM A COUPLE OF HIKERS

14:02.670 --> 14:04.228
ABOUT AN ABANDONED BLUE ECHO

14:04.270 --> 14:06.465
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
WITH GUS'S LICENSE PLATE.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.501
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
ANYTHING ABOUT A DAY TRIP.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.599
- YOU TWO ARE PO-PO?
- THAT'S RIGHT, LOS LOBOS.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.049
SO GET THAT CAMERA
OUT OF MY FACE.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.513
THIS HAD BETTER
BE GOOD, SPENCER.

14:13.550 --> 14:15.211
I JUST SHINED THESE SHOES.
THAT AND THE FACT

14:15.250 --> 14:17.218
THAT YOU AND GUSTER AREN'T DEAD,
I AM BORDERLINE FURIOUS.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.639
- OKAY, LISTEN, LISTEN.
THIS IS KATE AND CHAVO.

14:19.690 --> 14:21.453
THEY ARE FILM STUDENTS
MAKING A DOCUMENTARY

14:21.490 --> 14:24.926
ABOUT FINDING BIGFOOT
RIGHT HERE IN THESE WOODS.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.418
THEY HIRED ME TO HELP THEM
TRACK THE BEAST PSYCHICALLY.

14:28.460 --> 14:29.449
- HIRED?
NO, YOU VOLUNTEERED.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.922
WE'RE NOT PAYING YOU CACA.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.461
- NEEDLESS TO SAY,
WE TRACKED THE BEAST

14:33.500 --> 14:34.933
TO ITS DOMICILE.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.437
IT WAS STARTLED,
IT GAVE CHASE.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.131
WE BARELY MADE IT OUT
WITH OUR LIVES.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.603
BUT WE DID
UNEARTH A CATACOMB

14:39.640 --> 14:41.574
FILLED WITH THE CORPSES
OF HIS VICTIMS,

14:41.610 --> 14:43.475
WHICH HE WILL PRESUMABLY
BE EATING LATER

14:43.510 --> 14:45.000
ALONG WITH GUS FOR DESSERT.
- WHAT?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.472
- AND WE GOT THE WHOLE THING
ON CAMERA.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.647
- THAT IS 0% FUNNY, SHAWN.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.216
- PLEASE LET ME SHOOT
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

14:49.250 --> 14:51.115
JUST A FLESH WOUND,
SOMETHING HE CAN WALK AWAY FROM.

14:51.150 --> 14:52.583
PLEASE.
- BOYFRIEND?

14:52.620 --> 14:54.588
THIS MONOGAMY IS REALLY STARTING
TO BUM ME OUT.

14:54.620 --> 14:55.951
- YOU SAY
YOU GOT ALL THIS ON CAMERA?

14:55.990 --> 14:57.082
- YES, WE DID.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.224
NO, WAY.
COME ON, LASSIE.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.558
YOU SAW THE FOOTAGE.
- IMPOSSIBLE.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.921
- I KNOW.
IT'S SHOCKING, REALLY.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.995
BUT NO CORPSES
CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING:

15:07.040 --> 15:08.598
IT'S THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.164
WELL, PERHAPS IT'S FOR THE BEST
RIGHT HERE IN THE WOODS

15:10.210 --> 15:12.030
AWAY FROM THE POPULOUS.
- THAT CAN'T BE.

15:12.070 --> 15:14.937
THEY WERE COLD AND ASHY
AND PALE AND DEAD.

15:14.980 --> 15:18.177
- I THINK IT IS PAINFULLY CLEAR
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.

15:18.210 --> 15:21.213
YOU TWO NIMRODS
HAVE ORCHESTRATED A LITTLE HOAX

15:21.250 --> 15:23.309
SO THAT YOUR FILM'S
NOT A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME,

15:23.350 --> 15:25.045
AND YOU FOUND THE PERFECT
TWO CHOWDERHEADS TO FALL FOR IT.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.546
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

15:26.590 --> 15:28.319
- LASSIE, THAT'S WHAT
WE THOUGHT AT FIRST.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.022
BUT IT DOESN'T ADD UP ANYMORE.
- THINK ABOUT IT, SPENCER.

15:31.060 --> 15:34.223
PUT YOUR FINGER TO YOUR HEAD
AND USE YOUR BRAIN.

15:34.260 --> 15:35.727
THEY GOT A COUPLE
OF THEIR BONG BUDDIES

15:35.760 --> 15:37.227
TO CRAWL IN THE HOLE
AND PLAY DEAD.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.022
YOU GOT HOSED.

15:39.070 --> 15:43.063
BUT NOW THEY HAVE GONE TOO FAR,
BECAUSE MY TIME IS MONEY.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.237
- WAIT A MINUTE. HOW COME
WE'RE RULING OUT THE THEORY

15:45.270 --> 15:47.033
THAT THE YETI MOVED
HIS FOOD STASH

15:47.080 --> 15:49.298
BECAUSE WE FOUND IT?
- YETI IS INCORRECT.

15:49.340 --> 15:51.740
THEY LIVE IN MUCH SNOWIER
CLIMATES LIKE HOTH.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.179
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
MY BAD.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.518
- PLUS, I FOUND IT
BY ACCIDENT, LASSIE.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.745
I HAD TO TUMBLE ALL THE WAY
DOWN A RIDGE TO FIND IT.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.350
- GUS HAS A POINT.
I MEAN, THE HOLE WAS COVERED.

16:00.390 --> 16:02.210
I DON'T THINK THOSE BODIES
WERE MEANT TO BE FOUND.

16:02.260 --> 16:05.650
- O'HARA, I FORBID YOU
TO BUY INTO THIS LOAD OF CRAP.

16:05.690 --> 16:08.090
WE SHOULD ARREST THEM
AND GO BACK TO THE CITY.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.223
- UH, I AM SENSING
THESE BODIES DID NOT GET UP

16:10.270 --> 16:12.067
AND WALK AWAY
ON THEIR OWN.

16:12.100 --> 16:15.069
WHICH ALSO PUTS THE KIBOSH
ON LASSIE'S ZOMBIE THEORY.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.330
YOU SEE...
THEY WERE DRAGGED.

16:17.370 --> 16:20.032
- HA! CHUPALO!

16:20.080 --> 16:21.229
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:21.280 --> 16:23.771
YOU TELL ME WHAT
THAT MEANS RIGHT NOW.

16:23.810 --> 16:26.142
WELL, THIS IS QUITE
A HAUL.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.738
- WELL, THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.316
ACCORDING TO
THE TRACKING DEVICE,

16:29.350 --> 16:31.648
BIGFOOT IS...
ONE OF US.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.089
- STOP SAYING BIGFOOT
LIKE HE'S REAL.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.348
- GUS ATE A GIANT
TURKEY LEG

16:34.390 --> 16:36.085
WITH A TRANSMITTER IN IT.
- AW, COME ON.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.621
IT WASN'T WEIRD TO YOU
THAT IT WAS JUST SITTING

16:37.660 --> 16:38.684
IN A FREAKING TREE?

16:38.730 --> 16:40.618
- SOMEONE WOULD
HAVE US BELIEVE

16:40.660 --> 16:42.628
THAT THESE BODIES
WENT INTO THE DRINK,

16:42.660 --> 16:44.719
WHICH MEANS WE'VE GOT
TO DREDGE THIS CREEK

16:44.770 --> 16:48.262
AND BRING IN SOME SERIOUS
SBPD MANPOWER.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.790
NOW YOU TWO FILM GEEKS...

16:49.840 --> 16:52.161
THINK LONG AND HARD
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY NEXT.

16:52.210 --> 16:54.701
PLAYTIME IS OVER.
I WILL NOT BE TOYED WITH.

16:54.740 --> 16:57.106
[metallic clang]

16:57.150 --> 16:59.300
[screams]

16:59.350 --> 17:02.114
SON OF A--
GOD!

17:02.150 --> 17:04.789
[YEIPS]
OH, MY--

17:04.820 --> 17:06.378
AAH! AAH!

17:06.420 --> 17:07.751
AAH!

17:07.790 --> 17:12.784
[screaming]

17:12.830 --> 17:14.798
- OH, GOD!

17:14.830 --> 17:16.752
DON'T FIGHT THE CURRENT!

17:16.800 --> 17:20.668
TRY TO GRAB ONTO SOMETHING!
I'M COMING!

17:20.700 --> 17:22.236
- WHERE--
WHERE YOU GOING?

17:22.270 --> 17:24.101
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SHAWN.
YOU DO YOU.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.732
- THERE HE IS!
COME ON, WE CAN GO DOWN HERE.

17:25.770 --> 17:27.101
COME ON.
- OH.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.779
- [screaming]

17:29.810 --> 17:31.368
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR CALLING ME LOS LOBOS.

17:31.410 --> 17:35.414
- DUDE, THIS
IS A TOTAL BONUS.

17:35.450 --> 17:37.714
- AAH!
- WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

17:37.750 --> 17:42.210
- STAY BACK, CHAVO!
- I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT.

17:42.260 --> 17:48.199
- [grunting]

17:48.230 --> 17:49.697
LASSIE, GRAB THE BRANCH!

17:49.730 --> 17:51.789
IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

17:51.830 --> 17:54.390
- THANK YOU, O'HARA!
- YES! GOOD WORK!

17:54.440 --> 17:57.329
- JULES, YOU'RE AMAZING!

17:57.370 --> 17:58.837
HANG ON, LASSIE,
WE'LL HAVE YOU OUT OF THERE

17:58.870 --> 18:01.873
IN NO TIME!
[bird screeches]

18:01.910 --> 18:03.309
HEY!

18:03.350 --> 18:05.102
THAT LADY HAWK
STOLE MY CAMERA!

18:05.150 --> 18:06.242
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S A FEMALE?

18:06.280 --> 18:07.713
- SHE'S CIRCLING AROUND.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.445
- I THINK MY WHOLE LEG
JUST CAME OFF.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.119
- LASSIE, SHE'S COMING
BACK THIS WAY.

18:12.150 --> 18:14.118
I THINK SHE'S
GONNA DROP IT.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.388
CATCH IT!
YOU HAVE TO CATCH IT!

18:15.420 --> 18:17.183
CATCH IT!

18:20.730 --> 18:23.164
- THAT WAS THE SEXIEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.794
OR AT LEAST TOP EIGHT.
- WOW. WOW.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.764
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S THE BEST

18:27.800 --> 18:29.267
WE'RE GONNA DO
FOR NOW, PARTNER.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.801
- STEPPED IN A BEAR TRAP.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.899
- OH, WHAT IS THIS?

18:32.940 --> 18:36.330
- THIS IS SO HUMILIATING.
I CAN'T TELL MARLOWE THE TRUTH.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.746
I'VE GOT TO COME UP
WITH A COVER STORY.

18:38.780 --> 18:39.906
DO YOU MIND?

18:39.950 --> 18:41.508
- DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHERE WE ARE?

18:41.550 --> 18:43.381
BECAUSE I CERTAINLY DON'T,
AND THIS SUCKS.

18:43.420 --> 18:44.717
- YEAH, AGREED.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.308
WE CAN FOLLOW THE RIVER
UP A WAYS,

18:46.350 --> 18:48.250
BUT THE TRACKS WON'T BE GOOD
ONCE THE SUN GOES DOWN.

18:48.290 --> 18:49.712
- DIDN'T YOU GUYS
BRING A MAP?

18:49.760 --> 18:51.853
- I KICKED IT INTO THE CREEK.
- YOU DID WHAT?

18:51.890 --> 18:54.199
- THAT'S THE STUPIDEST THING
YOU COULD'VE DONE, CHAVO.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.198
- [chuckling]
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.790
WE ACTUALLY
NEVER HAD A MAP.

18:58.830 --> 19:01.264
- THINK YOU CAN MOVE
ON THAT LEG?

19:01.300 --> 19:02.858
- NOT VERY FAST.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.538
DAMN IT TO HELL!

19:04.570 --> 19:05.867
IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN
BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI

19:05.910 --> 19:07.400
BUT YOU GET
TO BE BILL HOLDEN.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.237
- WE'RE GONNA FREEZE
OUR PINONES OFF.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.872
- OKAY.

19:10.910 --> 19:12.446
WE ARE GONNA
SET UP CAMP FOR THE NIGHT.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.368
WE'RE GONNA BACK OURSELVES UP
TO THE WATER

19:14.420 --> 19:16.479
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT A 360-DEGREE PERIMETER.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.919
WE WILL BUILD A FIRE.

19:17.950 --> 19:20.214
AT FIRST LIGHT,
I WILL FIND MY WAY OUT OF HERE,

19:20.260 --> 19:21.386
AND I WILL COME BACK
WITH THE CAVALRY.

19:21.420 --> 19:23.251
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:23.290 --> 19:24.780
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO
BY YOURSELF.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.253
- SHAWN, EVERYONE HAS
TO STAY HERE WITH LASSITER.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.791
I'LL BE TWICE AS FAST ON MY OWN.
- WHAT ABOUT ME, JULIET?

19:29.830 --> 19:30.922
I'M AT LEAST TWICE AS FAST
AS SHAWN.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.528
- THAT IS A LIE.
- SHH!

19:32.570 --> 19:34.390
I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE HERE ALL NIGHT, JULIET.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.566
- NO, DETECTIVE O'HARA'S RIGHT.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.807
OW!
NO, I'M FINE.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.398
FINE.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.976
I'M CERTAINLY NOT
GONNA SLEEP A WINK TONIGHT,

19:41.010 --> 19:43.808
SO I'LL SET UP A PERIMETER
AND TAKE WATCH.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.806
O'HARA WILL SET UP CAMP
AND PROTECT THE HERD.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.579
- WAIT. PLEASE TAKE
ONE OF THE CAMERAS WITH YOU.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.815
IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO US.

19:49.850 --> 19:53.513
IF YOU, UH, SEE ANYTHING,
JUST POINT AND SHOOT.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.549
- WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE TO YOU?

19:54.590 --> 19:55.955
- THE LOVE CHILD

19:55.990 --> 19:59.778
OF MATTHEW PERRY
AND...TONY RANDALL.

19:59.830 --> 20:02.526
HERE.

20:02.560 --> 20:07.566
IT'S GONNA GET
BALLS-COLD OUT TONIGHT.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.808
- WHAT KIND OF WOOL IS THIS?
- IT'S AN ANGORA BLEND, I THINK.

20:10.840 --> 20:15.402
- IT'S DELIGHTFUL.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

20:15.440 --> 20:16.805
JUST POINT AND SHOOT.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.379
- THIS FIRE IS VERY,
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

20:21.420 --> 20:25.242
I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU
WERE SO RUGGED AND OUTDOORSY.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.417
- WELL, THAT IS BECAUSE
YOU STEADFASTLY REFUSE

20:27.460 --> 20:29.018
TO GO HIKING, CAMPING,

20:29.060 --> 20:31.551
OR MOUNTAIN BIKING
WITH ME, SHAWN.

20:31.590 --> 20:34.491
- BECAUSE LOOK
WHAT HAPPENS, JULES.

20:34.530 --> 20:36.293
MOTHER NATURE
WAS NOT MEANT FOR US.

20:36.330 --> 20:40.892
IT WAS MEANT FOR THE ANIMALS
AND JEFF PROBST.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.532
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOT REALLY PROBST,

20:42.570 --> 20:44.868
BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS
THAT AFTER WRAP,

20:44.910 --> 20:47.378
HE GOES TO THE MARRIOTT.
- MAN...

20:47.410 --> 20:50.538
I LOVE THE OUTDOORS
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.047
WE'RE ALL ANIMALS.

20:52.080 --> 20:55.811
HEY, HAVE YOU GUYS EVER
SEEN CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST?

20:55.850 --> 20:57.943
- NOTHING'S BEEPING
ON THE BIGFOOT TRACKER.

20:57.990 --> 21:01.812
- HUH?

21:01.860 --> 21:03.828
OH, MY GOD.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.522
THAT'S WHAT
YOU RAN OFF TO DO?

21:06.560 --> 21:09.393
HOW--WAIT.
WHAT DID YOU USE--

21:09.430 --> 21:13.560
- WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT THIS, SHAWN, EVER.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.330
YOU CAN ALL SUCK IT.

21:16.370 --> 21:19.931
[distant screech]

21:19.970 --> 21:23.349
- STAY PUT.

21:23.380 --> 21:25.405
[distant screech]

21:29.350 --> 21:33.081
- SO...COLD.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.908
MY ANKLE'S A LITTLE
WORSE OFF THAN I LET ON.

21:36.960 --> 21:41.829
I'VE LOST QUITE A LOT
OF BLOOD.

21:41.860 --> 21:45.091
IT'S TIME
TO BE HONEST.

21:45.130 --> 21:48.839
I'M NO HERO.
NOT TONIGHT.

21:48.870 --> 21:53.102
- * CLOSE YOUR EYES

21:53.140 --> 21:57.349
* GIVE ME YOUR HAND,
DARLING *

21:57.380 --> 22:00.611
* DO YOU FEEL
MY HEART BEATING? *

22:00.650 --> 22:02.914
* DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

22:02.950 --> 22:06.511
both: * DO YOU FEEL
THE SAME? *

22:06.550 --> 22:10.680
* AM I ONLY DREAMING?

22:10.730 --> 22:13.597
* IS THIS BURNING

22:13.630 --> 22:17.088
* AN ETERNAL FLAME?

22:17.130 --> 22:21.032
* I BELIEVE IT'S MEANT TO BE

22:21.070 --> 22:22.367
- * DARLING

22:22.400 --> 22:26.962
- I WOULD LIKE
TO APOLOGIZE.

22:27.010 --> 22:31.071
I'M SORRY, MARLOWE.

22:31.110 --> 22:34.113
SORRY I WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

22:34.150 --> 22:37.938
MOM, ALTHEA...

22:37.990 --> 22:39.719
I JUST WANT TO SAY
ONCE AND FOR ALL

22:39.750 --> 22:43.880
THAT YOUR HAPPINESS
IS MY HAPPINESS.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.421
I WON'T BE MAKING ANY MORE
OFF-COLOR LPGA JOKES

22:46.460 --> 22:47.950
DURING THE HOLIDAYS.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.697
both: * WATCH YOU
WHEN YOU ARE SLEEPING *

22:51.730 --> 22:53.960
* YOU BELONG WITH ME

22:54.000 --> 22:57.561
* DO YOU FEEL
THE SAME? *

22:57.610 --> 23:01.432
* AM I ONLY DREAMING?

23:01.480 --> 23:05.007
* OR IS THIS BURNING
- * BURNING

23:05.050 --> 23:08.508
- * AN ETERNAL FLAME?
- * ETERNAL FLAME

23:08.550 --> 23:10.541
- * SAY MY NAME

23:10.590 --> 23:12.683
* SUN SHINES
THROUGH THE RAIN *

23:12.720 --> 23:14.984
* MY WHOLE LIFE WAS SO LONELY
- * FLAME

23:15.020 --> 23:16.749
- HEY, GUYS.
HI.

23:16.790 --> 23:18.189
YEAH, HOW 'BOUT WE DON'T
ATTRACT ATTENTION

23:18.230 --> 23:20.050
TO OURSELVES
BY SINGING A SONG?

23:20.090 --> 23:25.619
- I'M GOING
TO DIE OUT HERE.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.695
[sniffling]

23:27.740 --> 23:33.201
O'HARA, YOU ARE
THE BEST PARTNER

23:33.240 --> 23:36.630
THAT I HAVE EVER, EVER...

23:42.520 --> 23:46.513
[growling]

24:02.040 --> 24:04.008
- THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.905
- OH, MY GOSH.

24:05.940 --> 24:08.170
BIGFOOT TOOK LASSIE.

24:08.210 --> 24:11.475
OH, MY GOSH, OH, MY GOSH,
THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.

24:11.510 --> 24:13.876
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

24:13.920 --> 24:18.744
- I-I THINK THERE'S
ONLY ONE THING TO DO HERE.

24:22.990 --> 24:26.221
CARLTON LASSITER
WAS A DECENT MAN.

24:26.260 --> 24:29.491
I'LL, UH--I'LL NEVER FORGET
THE TIME HE CHASED GUS

24:29.530 --> 24:30.861
WITH A SAMURAI SWORD.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.937
HE JUST ABOUT
TOOK HIS HEAD OFF.

24:33.970 --> 24:35.938
ALTHOUGH WE MAY HAVE NOT ALWAYS
SEEN EYE TO EYE,

24:35.970 --> 24:40.578
HE DID HAVE A GENUINE INTEREST
IN UPHOLDING THE LAW.

24:40.610 --> 24:45.001
AND OF COURSE HE HAD
THE SWEET, SWEET STERN BUSH.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.506
GUS, YOU WANT TO ADD
ANYTHING TO THAT?

24:46.550 --> 24:48.518
- NO.
- STOP.

24:48.550 --> 24:50.279
LOOK, CARLTON IS NOT DEAD.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.845
HE CAN'T BE, I WON'T LET HIM.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

24:52.890 --> 24:54.551
OKAY, NOW WE'RE GOING
TO FIND HIM,

24:54.590 --> 24:55.852
AND THEN WE'RE ALL GOING
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.824
- CHI-CHI, HOW ARE WE DOING
ON BATTERY?

24:57.860 --> 24:59.521
- UH, HALF, AND WE STILL
HAVE AUXILIARY.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.790
- NICE, WE'RE READY
WHEN YOU ARE.

25:01.830 --> 25:02.990
- JULES, YOU'RE UPSET.

25:03.030 --> 25:04.725
- WHY ARE YOU
FILMING THIS, SHAWN?

25:04.770 --> 25:06.829
- YOU'RE EMOTIONAL,
AND IF THIS WAS ME SAYING,

25:06.870 --> 25:09.839
"HEY, LET'S GO POKE THE HORNET'S
NEST WITH ONE OF GUS'S SHOES,"

25:09.870 --> 25:12.532
YOU WOULD SAY NO, AND YOU WOULD
FORCE ME TO BE REASONABLE.

25:12.570 --> 25:15.038
- SHAWN, I SMELL BARBECUE.
- NO, YOU DON'T, BUDDY.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.729
YOU'RE JUST--
YOU'RE DISTRESSED,

25:16.780 --> 25:18.702
AND YOU'RE PROJECTING
A DELUSION OF GRANDEUR.

25:18.750 --> 25:19.978
- NO.
- GRANDEUR.

25:20.010 --> 25:22.274
- NO, IT'S SMOKED MEAT,
AND IT'S FRESH.

25:22.320 --> 25:25.642
IT'S FRESHLY SMOKED MEAT.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.578
- THAT'S THE DIRECTION
CARLTON WAS TAKEN.

25:27.620 --> 25:29.019
LET'S GO!
EVERYBODY, NOW!

25:29.060 --> 25:30.880
- HE SURE KNOWS
A LOT ABOUT SMOKED MEAT.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.989
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WHAT--CHAVO.

25:33.030 --> 25:35.225
- THIS IS THE BOOBS, MAN.
- NO.

25:35.260 --> 25:36.989
NO, THIS IS NOT
THE BOOBS.

25:37.030 --> 25:39.794
- SHAWN, I SAID
STAY BEHIND ME.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.866
- THREE, TWO...

25:41.900 --> 25:44.937
- WE ARE CURRENTLY TRACKING
THE MONSTER IN AN ATTEMPT

25:44.970 --> 25:47.029
TO ALSO FIND THE REMAINS
OF ONE OF OUR OWN.

25:47.070 --> 25:49.277
- THAT IS OVERSTATED.
- FIX IT IN POST.

25:49.310 --> 25:51.699
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
WE HAVE RISKED EVERYTHING

25:51.750 --> 25:53.718
IN ORDER TO BRING THE TRUTH
BEHIND THIS LEGEND

25:53.750 --> 25:55.718
TO THE REST
OF THE FREE SPEAKING WORLD.

25:55.750 --> 25:57.012
- BOOM, I DON'T CARE
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN

25:57.050 --> 25:58.813
SINCE I BUSTED OUT
THE SUPER SNIFFER.

25:58.850 --> 26:01.751
IT'S LIKE RIDING A BIKE
WITH MY NOSTRILS AND CILIA.

26:01.790 --> 26:03.314
- LOOK OVER THERE.
THAT'S THE SAME CAVE

26:03.360 --> 26:05.624
WE COULD SEE FROM THE BLIND,
WHICH MEANS...

26:05.660 --> 26:07.594
WE'VE GONE IN A BIG CIRCLE.
- SHH!

26:07.630 --> 26:09.052
STAY WITH ME,
ALL OF YOU.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.601
- UH-OH.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.005
- OH, MY GOD,
THOSE ARE CARLTON'S CLOTHES.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.873
- HOMES GOT ROASTED
ROTISSERIE STYLE.

26:22.910 --> 26:25.743
- OKAY, UH,
IN LIEU OF EVERYTHING

26:25.780 --> 26:28.669
THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
WITH THAT MAN...

26:28.720 --> 26:30.745
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M ABOUT TO SAY THIS...

26:30.790 --> 26:34.089
LASSIE DOES SMELL
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. GUS?

26:34.120 --> 26:37.112
- AMEN. HE'S BEEN
DRY-RUBBED. OW!

26:37.160 --> 26:38.980
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TWO?

26:39.030 --> 26:40.349
LOOK, I REFUSE TO BELIEVE
THAT THERE ISN'T

26:40.390 --> 26:42.028
A RATIONAL EXPLANATION
FOR ALL OF THIS,

26:42.060 --> 26:44.722
AND I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT BIGFOOT
IS DRY-RUBBING HIS DINNER

26:44.770 --> 26:46.829
WITH BARBECUE SAUCE.
- OF COURSE HE ISN'T.

26:46.870 --> 26:49.065
IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES.
THE OPERATIVE WORD IS "DRY,"

26:49.100 --> 26:50.909
MEANING "NO SAUCE."
- LOOK.

26:50.940 --> 26:53.602
THE SHOW MUST GO ON, RIGHT?
WE GOT TO GET INSIDE THAT CAVE.

27:01.450 --> 27:03.418
- ALL RIGHT, I'M SENSING
HE'S NOT IN THERE.

27:03.450 --> 27:06.339
I'M ALSO SENSING THAT BIGFOOT
MIGHT HAVE A GREEN THUMB.

27:06.390 --> 27:08.881
WHICH IS WEIRD,
BECAUSE HE'S BIGFOOT.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.751
HUH, THESE SEEDS
ALL TOOK REALLY WELL.

27:22.400 --> 27:26.029
HUH, WELL,
THIS IS SURPRISINGLY COZY.

27:26.070 --> 27:28.732
WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT A SOLAR PANEL?

27:28.780 --> 27:31.908
- CARLTON.
- HE'S HERE! HE'S ALIVE!

27:31.950 --> 27:34.874
- CARLTON, TALK TO ME.
TELL ME YOU'RE OKAY.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.047
- OOH, I DON'T KNOW.
I MAY HAVE JUMPED THE GUN.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.412
- IS THAT JUST HIS TORSO?
- YOU ARE ALL HEARTLESS!

27:39.450 --> 27:43.409
- OH, HEY, GUYS.
- CARLTON.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.678
OH, MY GOD,
WE ALL THOUGHT THAT--

27:45.730 --> 27:47.755
THEY THOUGHT.
- NO, I'M FINE.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.119
WE WERE GONNA COME FIND YOU
RIGHT AFTER BRUNCH.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.720
- WE?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.897
all: AAH!
- AAH!

27:53.940 --> 27:56.864
all: AAH!
- DON'T SHOOT! I'M UNARMED!

27:56.900 --> 27:58.902
- DEAR GOD, YOU CAN SPEAK.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.079
- SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

28:01.110 --> 28:04.102
- HE'S OKAY, O'HARA.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.242
- OKAY, I MAY HAVE FIBBED
A LITTLE BIT

28:05.280 --> 28:06.872
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATES THERE.

28:06.910 --> 28:08.446
I'M ARMED,
BUT I'M NOT DANGEROUS.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.879
- YOU LOOK DANGEROUS.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.148
- I MEAN,
I'M REALLY DANGEROUS.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.488
I'M JUST NOT VENGEFUL
OR VINDICT IVE.

28:13.520 --> 28:14.987
- IT'S OKAY, ED.
THEY'RE WITH ME.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.409
- CARLTON,
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

28:17.460 --> 28:20.452
- O'HARA, THIS HERE
IS BIG ED DIXON.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.754
HE SAVED MY LIFE.
TRUTH IS...

28:22.800 --> 28:25.018
MY ANKLE WAS A LOT WORSE OFF
THAN I ADMITTED.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.867
I BLED PROFUSELY,
AND AT SOME POINT IN THE NIGHT,

28:26.900 --> 28:27.935
I PASSED OUT.

28:27.970 --> 28:29.938
HEY, YOU FOUND MY SHOE!

28:29.970 --> 28:32.029
- I FOUND THE TRAP
WITH BLOOD ON IT,

28:32.070 --> 28:34.504
SAW CARLTON,
PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER,

28:34.540 --> 28:36.838
AND FELT HORRIBLE.
IT WAS MY TRAP.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.040
- BIG ED PICKED ME UP
LIKE A BABY FAWN

28:38.080 --> 28:39.502
AND BROUGHT ME BACK HERE.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.916
HE CLEANED UP MY ANKLE,
REDRESSED MY WOUND.

28:41.950 --> 28:43.076
- WHAT'S WITH
THE FURRY COSTUME?

28:43.120 --> 28:44.917
- AND WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

28:44.950 --> 28:47.180
- I'VE BEEN LIVING IN
THESE WOODS FOR OVER A DECADE.

28:47.220 --> 28:50.053
SAD TRUTH IS, I JUST LOST FAITH
IN THE HUMAN RACE.

28:50.090 --> 28:52.923
NOW, I WAS AN ARMY RANGER
BACK IN THE DAY,

28:52.960 --> 28:56.748
SO I KNEW I COULD EXIST
AT ONE WITH NATURE.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.428
I DON'T HAVE TO OPEN THE PAPER
EVERY MORNING AND GET DEPRESSED.

28:59.470 --> 29:01.199
- YOU LOST FAITH IN HUMANITY.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.037
YOU KNOW,
GUS AND I THOUGHT

29:03.070 --> 29:04.901
ABOUT DOING THE SAME THING
AFTER WE SAW THE VILLAGE,

29:04.940 --> 29:06.908
BUT THEN WE DIDN'T
BECAUSE THAT MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE.

29:06.940 --> 29:10.307
- IN ANY EVENT, I CREATED
THIS PELT SUIT FOR CAMOUFLAGE.

29:10.340 --> 29:12.046
IT ALLOWS ME
TO HUNT AND MOVE ABOUT

29:12.080 --> 29:15.015
WITHOUT DISTURBING
THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS.

29:15.050 --> 29:17.939
PLUS, I BURN EASILY.
- GOD, YOU'RE LIKE PREDATOR.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.857
BUT TOTALLY DOABLE.

29:20.890 --> 29:23.779
- WELL, I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR SAVING MY PARTNER,

29:23.830 --> 29:25.980
AND I REALLY HATE
TO BE A BUZZKILL HERE,

29:26.030 --> 29:27.998
BUT THERE ARE STILL THREE BODIES
THAT ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR.

29:28.030 --> 29:29.156
I SUPPOSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT,

29:29.200 --> 29:30.861
WOULD YOU, MR. DIXON?

29:30.900 --> 29:33.528
- NO, MA'AM,
I WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.

29:33.570 --> 29:35.162
ANYBODY HUNGRY?

29:35.200 --> 29:36.963
- OH, YEAH.
- YES.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.309
- I'VE BEEN SMOKING SOME VENISON
OUTSIDE ALL MORNING.

29:39.340 --> 29:43.037
TRUST ME, MY DRY-RUB IS THE BEST
THING YOU'LL EVER TASTE.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.900
- AFFIRMATIVE.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.248
UH, SO IT SMELLS.

29:47.280 --> 29:51.182
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.108
- WHAT?
- DON'T YOU "WHAT?" ME.

29:53.150 --> 29:55.186
SHOW ME YOUR TEETH.

29:55.220 --> 29:57.313
YOU SAMPLED THE MEAT.
IT'S STUCK IN YOUR TEETH.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.523
YOU TASTED THE MEAT WHEN
WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS LASSIE?

30:00.560 --> 30:03.028
- SO WHAT, SHAWN?
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

30:03.060 --> 30:04.823
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID,
"HE SMELLS DELICIOUS."

30:04.870 --> 30:07.327
- I WAS TRYING TO PUT A POSITIVE
SPIN ON A HORRIFIC EVENT.

30:07.370 --> 30:08.837
I CERTAINLY WASN'T
GONNA PARTAKE.

30:08.870 --> 30:10.292
- I CAN FEEL
MY RIBS, SHAWN.

30:10.340 --> 30:12.103
- GUS, IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN
24 HOURS.

30:12.140 --> 30:15.007
- OKAY, OKAY, THERE'S PLENTY
OF MEAT FOR EVERYONE,

30:15.040 --> 30:17.031
AND NONE OF IT'S HUMAN, OKAY?

30:17.080 --> 30:18.843
I'M GONNA HOOF IT UP
TO THE RANGER STATION,

30:18.880 --> 30:20.848
GET AN ATV BACK IN HERE
FOR CARLTON.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.269
I JUST NEED TO GET OUT
OF THIS SUIT.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.039
SPEAKING OF SUITS, YOURS
SHOULD BE DRY BY NOW, CARLTON.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.318
- THANKS, ED.

30:27.350 --> 30:29.955
- OH, THIS IS LIKE CRACK
MADE OUT OF DEER.

30:29.990 --> 30:31.150
- WHERE IS SHAWN?

30:31.190 --> 30:33.283
- PROBABLY IN THE BACK,
SNOOPING AROUND.

30:33.330 --> 30:35.321
YOU GUYS AREN'T AT ALL
SUSPICIOUS OF ED?

30:35.360 --> 30:37.089
- YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE
ANY TROUBLE EATING HIS FOOD.

30:37.130 --> 30:38.529
OW!

30:38.570 --> 30:42.495
SPENCER, YOU BETTER NOT
BE SNOOPING BACK THERE!

30:42.540 --> 30:45.907
- PRETTY BARE BONES,
HUH, ED?

30:45.940 --> 30:48.101
WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE THERE?

30:54.650 --> 30:58.188
[grunting]

30:58.220 --> 31:01.087
- I'M JUST SAYING, DUDE'S
BEEN LIVING HERE FOR HOW LONG?

31:01.120 --> 31:03.179
AND HE'S NEVER
SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING?

31:03.220 --> 31:05.256
COME ON, SON.
- ED DIXON'S AN ANGEL

31:05.290 --> 31:07.281
IN WOLF'S, BEAR'S,
AND ELK'S CLOTHING.

31:07.330 --> 31:08.627
WHY WOULD HE NURSE ME
BACK TO HEALTH

31:08.660 --> 31:10.196
IF HE WAS A COLD-BLOODED
KILLER, GUSTER?

31:10.230 --> 31:11.663
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
HE'S A REAL MAN.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.099
- HE'S TWO MEN.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.269
SEVEN FEET AND WHAT?
LIKE, 400 POUNDS?

31:15.300 --> 31:17.131
DID YOU GET A LOAD
OF THOSE MEAT HOOKS?

31:17.170 --> 31:20.298
CAN YOU IMAGINE?
- IMAGINE WHAT?

31:45.270 --> 31:46.692
- HEY, YOU GUYS,
YOU SHOULD GET IN HERE.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.290
- DAMN IT, SPENCER,
I TOLD YOU NOT TO--

31:51.410 --> 31:53.628
- I FOUND THESE BURIED
IN THE BOTTOM

31:53.670 --> 31:55.274
OF ED'S FOOT LOCKER,
SOAKING WET.

31:55.310 --> 31:57.335
- IT'S JIMMY DEL RAY.
- TITUS CLACKUM.

31:57.380 --> 31:59.041
- BOTH WENT MISSING
TWO WEEKS AGO.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.672
THE TRAIL WENT ICE-COLD.
THEY'RE ASSOCIATED

32:00.710 --> 32:02.211
WITH THE SERBIAN
CRIME SYNDICATE UP NORTH.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.717
THESE GUYS HAVE TAKEN
CONTRACT KILLING

32:03.750 --> 32:05.684
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

32:05.720 --> 32:07.711
BIG ED IS TAKING OUT
THE TRASH FOR MOBSTERS

32:07.750 --> 32:09.615
WHO DON'T EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH.
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.150
I MEAN, THEY'RE BOUND
TO HAVE ACCENTS.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.454
- WAIT, THERE WERE
THREE BODIES IN THAT HOLE.

32:13.490 --> 32:15.492
- A WOMAN?
- NOT NECESSARILY.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.461
-AAH!

32:20.500 --> 32:22.468
- I AM SENSING
IT WAS A GIRL

32:22.500 --> 32:24.400
WITH A DRAGON TATTOO
ON THE CALF.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.408
A DRAGON EATING SOMETHING
BLOODY AND HEART-SHAPED.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.305
- A HEART.
- EVA KIRILENKO.

32:28.340 --> 32:30.069
I'VE CERTAINLY BOOKED HER
ENOUGH TIMES.

32:30.110 --> 32:31.975
HOOKER/STRIPPER, AND GUESS
WHERE SHE WORKED THE POLE.

32:32.010 --> 32:33.341
- CLACKUM'S.
I'LL BE DAMNED.

32:33.380 --> 32:34.745
- SHE MUST'VE GOTTEN MIXED UP
IN HIS BUSINESS.

32:34.780 --> 32:36.316
- SHE SHOULD'VE STUCK
TO HOOKING.

32:36.350 --> 32:37.669
- ALL RIGHT, THERE IT IS.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.312
WE KNOW WHO
THE DEAD PEOPLE ARE,

32:39.350 --> 32:41.113
AND WE KNOW WHO KILLED THEM,
AND WE'RE IN HIS HOUSE.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.354
- DIXON, THOUGH?
I MEAN IT DOESN'T EVEN

32:42.390 --> 32:43.709
SORT OF SOUND
LIKE SERBIAN NAME.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.058
- UNLESS HE CHANGED IT
FROM DIXONOVICH.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.991
- WE NEED TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.262
OH! AAH!

32:55.700 --> 32:57.031
- YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN THESE?

32:57.070 --> 32:59.004
- I FOUND THOSE NETTING SALMON.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.735
- I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME WITH US, ED.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.704
- I'M AFRAID YOU'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE IT

33:02.740 --> 33:05.277
OUT OF HERE ALIVE,
CARLTON.

33:11.350 --> 33:13.079
- UM, ED?

33:15.560 --> 33:17.084
- I HAVE A PULSE.
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.428
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

33:18.460 --> 33:20.052
- DAMN IT.
- SO DOES THIS MEAN

33:20.090 --> 33:22.149
THAT BIG ED ISN'T A KILLER?
- YEAH, PROBABLY, KATE.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.519
BUT I DON'T THINK NOW'S
THE TIME TO MAKE YOUR MOVE.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.061
- IT'S GOT
TO BE THE SERBIANS.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.091
- AW, COME ON, MAN.
DON'T TELL ME THAT.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.734
- HOW DO WE KNOW ED WASN'T
ALREADY WORKING FOR THEM?

33:28.770 --> 33:31.136
- BECAUSE HE SAVED MY LIFE,
AND HE SERVED OUR COUNTRY,

33:31.170 --> 33:32.569
AND HE LOST HIS WIFE,
AND HE'S GOT A GARDEN, GUSTER.

33:32.610 --> 33:34.430
- WHY WOULD THE SERBS
BE OUT HERE?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.107
HOW WOULD THEY HAVE KNOWN GUS
WAS GONNA UNCOVER THOSE BODIES?

33:36.140 --> 33:37.778
- RIGHT.
I DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE.

33:37.810 --> 33:39.778
- WAIT.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.619
THE PICTURES ON THE BLOG.
- WHAT ABOUT THEM?

33:41.650 --> 33:43.675
- YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
POSTING PICTURES ON YOUR BLOG

33:43.720 --> 33:45.517
ALL OVER THESE WOODS
THIS WEEK.

33:45.550 --> 33:48.155
THE SERBS ARE BOUND TO HAVE
PEOPLE KEEPING TABS ON THE AREA.

33:48.190 --> 33:50.488
YOU BASICALLY ADVERTISED
THAT YOU WERE OUT HERE.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.181
- WHICH MEANS THEY KNEW
THEIR DUMPING GROUND

33:52.230 --> 33:53.720
HAS BEEN COMPROMISED,
SO THEY SENT OUT SOME MUSCLE

33:53.760 --> 33:55.455
TO TIE UP THE LOOSE ENDS
AND MOVE THE BODIES.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.695
- INCLUDING ME?
- NO, GUS, YOU'RE PROBABLY OKAY.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.061
OF COURSE
INCLUDING YOU.

33:59.100 --> 34:02.069
EVERYONE, ALL OF US,
AND POOR BIG ED.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.738
- HE MADE IT ALL THE WAY
BACK HERE TO WARN US,

34:03.770 --> 34:05.237
THAT BRAVE SUMBITCH.

34:05.270 --> 34:06.737
- OR THEY LET HIM GO

34:06.770 --> 34:08.670
SO THEY COULD TRACK HIM
AND SEE WHERE HE GOES.

34:08.710 --> 34:10.769
- SO SOME COLD-BLOODED
SERBIANS ARE COMING TO KILL US?

34:10.810 --> 34:13.301
- HAS THE STUDENT ACADEMY AWARD
EVER BEEN WON POSTHUMOUSLY?

34:13.350 --> 34:15.739
- WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.
- GUS, NO, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

34:15.780 --> 34:17.247
THAT'S LIKE LEADING
LAMBS TO SLAUGHTER.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.781
- O'HARA'S RIGHT.

34:18.820 --> 34:20.515
IF THEY WANT A FIGHT,
WE'LL GIVE THEM A FIGHT.

34:20.550 --> 34:22.654
- I'M REALLY MORE OF A LOVER.
all: WE KNOW.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.180
- SO WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE GONNA DO?

34:24.230 --> 34:27.085
- WELL, LOOK AROUND THIS PLACE.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.097
LET'S GET READY.

34:33.130 --> 34:35.837
YOU DO REALIZE WE'RE
IN GRAVE DANGER, RIGHT, CHAVO?

34:35.870 --> 34:38.532
- PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW.
- WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

34:38.570 --> 34:40.538
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
IT'S JUST A DEFAULT EXCUSE

34:40.570 --> 34:42.106
PEOPLE GIVE
IN FOUND-FOOTAGE MOVIES

34:42.140 --> 34:44.700
FOR WHY THEY KEEP SHOOTING
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.799
- YOU GUYS ARE USING ME LIKE
A CHEST OF DRAWERS, AREN'T YOU?

34:47.850 --> 34:51.286
- TRY TO RELAX, ED.
- OW, THAT'S WRONG.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.788
- GO PRO OR GO HOME.

34:53.820 --> 34:57.654
[glass shattering]

34:57.690 --> 35:00.124
- ALL RIGHT.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.889
I THINK WE'VE DONE
ALL WE CAN DO FOR TONIGHT.

35:01.930 --> 35:03.693
WITH ANY LUCK, SUNDOWN
WILL COME WITHOUT INCIDENT.

35:03.730 --> 35:05.266
WE CAN HEAD OUT OF HERE
AT FIRST LIGHT.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.291
I'LL BE KEEPING WATCH OUT HERE,
YOU GUYS STAY

35:07.330 --> 35:09.594
IN THE BACK WITH LASSITER,
AND TAKE YOUR CUES FROM HIM.

35:09.640 --> 35:12.564
WE ARE LIGHT ON FIREARMS,
BUT HE'S GOT A GUN IN THE BACK,

35:12.610 --> 35:16.137
AND GOD KNOWS WHAT HE USED
TO DO WITH THAT MORNING STAR.

35:16.180 --> 35:17.829
I'M SORRY
IT'S COME TO THIS,

35:17.880 --> 35:20.348
BUT WE WILL MAKE IT OUT OF HERE
IF WE WORK TOGETHER.

35:20.380 --> 35:22.769
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE SORRY TOO.

35:22.820 --> 35:24.310
- NO, WE'RE NOT.
[gunshot]

35:24.350 --> 35:27.183
CHI-CHI! CHI-CHI! DUDE!

35:35.660 --> 35:37.855

[gunshot]

35:37.900 --> 35:39.697
OH!

35:42.600 --> 35:44.261

35:44.310 --> 35:45.732
- WE'RE GONNA GET SHOT, SHAWN!
- WHERE DID JULES GO?

35:45.770 --> 35:46.930
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE HER
OUT HERE.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.733
- AT LEAST SHE HAS A GUN.
[gunshot]

35:48.780 --> 35:51.305
- [shouting in Serbian]

35:51.350 --> 35:53.841
[squealing]

35:53.880 --> 35:56.576
AH! AH!

35:58.690 --> 36:00.180
- [shouting in Serbian]

36:00.220 --> 36:01.653
- WHAT DO YOU
THINK THAT MEANS?

36:01.690 --> 36:04.625
- IT MEANS WE NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE, SHAWN.

36:04.660 --> 36:06.628
- SHAWN! GUS!
WHERE'D YOU GUYS GO?

36:06.660 --> 36:07.786
- SHAWN!

36:07.830 --> 36:09.798
JULES KNOWS HOW
TO SHOOT A CROSSBOW!

36:09.830 --> 36:13.368
[both shouting in Serbian]

36:13.400 --> 36:15.630

[gunfire]

36:18.670 --> 36:21.400
[Gus screams]

36:21.440 --> 36:22.668
- THIS IS INSANE!

36:22.710 --> 36:24.405
- [shouting in Serbian]

36:24.450 --> 36:25.701
- HOLY CRAP!

36:25.750 --> 36:29.641
- [speaking Serbian]

36:29.680 --> 36:31.341
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, LASSIE?
SHOOT THAT DUDE.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.847
- YOU STAY DOWN AND SHUT UP.
- UH...SOMEBODY HELP US.

36:33.890 --> 36:35.881
- COME TO PAPA,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.354
- [groaning]
- KATIE?

36:38.390 --> 36:41.257
- UM...HELP?
SOMEBODY HELP US!

36:41.300 --> 36:42.756
- KATIE?

36:42.800 --> 36:45.621
[gunshots]

36:45.670 --> 36:48.230
THANK YOU! THANKS!
WHERE'S THE OTHER ONE?

36:48.270 --> 36:50.261
- LASSIE, YOU GOT HIM.
YOU TOTALLY SHOT THAT DUDE.

36:50.300 --> 36:52.768
- OF COURSE I GOT HIM.
DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.004
WHERE'S O'HARA?

36:54.040 --> 36:57.271
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
TO THE WEST.

36:57.310 --> 37:00.700
- THIS COULD BE
MY LAST MEAL, SHAWN.

37:00.750 --> 37:01.876
- WHOA!

37:01.920 --> 37:04.889
- CARLTON, COVER ME!
[gunshots]

37:08.820 --> 37:10.287
CHAVO, KATE,
I NEED YOU GUYS

37:10.320 --> 37:11.685
TO APPLY PRESSURE
TO EACH OTHER'S WOUNDS.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.425
CAN YOU DO THAT?
- CHAVO, HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

37:13.460 --> 37:16.327
- I PEED. I'M STILL PEEING.
- OH, CHAVO, GOD! MY HAIR!

37:16.360 --> 37:18.499
[gunfire]
- [grunts]

37:18.530 --> 37:20.464
- CARLTON! SHAWN!

37:20.500 --> 37:24.334
- OH, MY GOD!
HE SHOT LASSIE!

37:24.370 --> 37:26.008
- THIS IS GONNA
BE SO HARD ON MY SON.

37:26.040 --> 37:29.476
- YOU DON'T HAVE A SON.
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, SHAWN.

37:29.510 --> 37:31.000
[squealing]

37:31.040 --> 37:32.905
- [speaking Serbian]

37:32.950 --> 37:35.714
[both grunting]

37:35.750 --> 37:38.514
[bones snap]

37:38.550 --> 37:42.281
- ED, YOU'RE ALIVE.
THANK YOU.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.787
- NO PROBLEM.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.857
I FEEL. . .WOOZY.

37:49.730 --> 37:52.028
- JULES, YOU'RE SO BADASS.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

37:52.070 --> 37:54.732
- THAT DEAD SERB SHOT LASSIE.

37:54.770 --> 37:57.364
- CARLTON? OH, COME ON.
TALK TO ME, CARLTON.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.709
- [groans]

37:59.740 --> 38:01.970
THIS REALLY HASN'T
BEEN MY DAY, O'HARA.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.745
- IT'S A DAMN SHAME.

38:08.780 --> 38:11.044
- HERE LIES BIG ED DIXON.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.082
HE WAS A GENTLE GIANT
WITH A SENSITIVE SOUL

38:13.120 --> 38:16.089
AND AN IMPRESSIVE ARMAMENT
OF MEDIEVAL WEAPONRY.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.553
IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM,

38:17.590 --> 38:19.319
GUS WOULD BE DEAD.
- SO WOULD YOU, SHAWN.

38:19.360 --> 38:20.486
- NOW THAT REMAINS OPEN
FOR DEBATE.

38:20.530 --> 38:21.792
- THERE IS NO DEBATE.

38:21.830 --> 38:23.593
BANG, BANG,
I'M DEAD, YOU'RE DEAD.

38:23.630 --> 38:25.518
- I WOULD'VE THROWN THE CAMERA
AT HIS FACE, GUS.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.663
- OH, PLEASE, THERE'S NO WAY
YOU WOULD'VE THROWN--AAH!

38:27.700 --> 38:31.568
- OW! [groans]
- WHAT?

38:31.610 --> 38:33.862
- DOESN'T ANYBODY CHECK
FOR A PULSE ANYMORE?

38:33.910 --> 38:35.798
- OH, MY GOSH.
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.432
I-I-I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW, ED.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.698
HOLD ON. I NEED AN EMT
OVER HERE RIGHT NOW!

38:39.750 --> 38:42.071
ED DIXON IS ALIVE!
HANG IN THERE, ED.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.678
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL STAT.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.711
- UM, I KIND OF TURNED MY BACK

38:45.750 --> 38:47.411
ON MODERN MEDICINE
TEN YEARS AGO.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.758
I'M FINE.

38:48.790 --> 38:51.429
CAN YOU JUST PULL THIS AXE
OUT OF MY SPINE, PLEASE?

38:51.460 --> 38:53.485
- UH, I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO
MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR THIS ONE.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.498
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
A STAPH INFECTION.

38:55.530 --> 38:57.691
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE SO.

38:57.730 --> 39:00.858
I'M GETTING WOOZY.

39:00.900 --> 39:04.438
- DIDN'T ANYBODY HEAR ME?
ED DIXON IS ALIVE!

39:04.470 --> 39:07.439
[pop music]

39:07.470 --> 39:15.479
*

39:36.800 --> 39:42.773
[cheers and applause]

39:42.810 --> 39:45.472
- THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT, GUYS.
THAT'S--THAT'S OUR FILM.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.448
I REALIZED, UH,
WHILE I WAS DOING THE CREDITS

39:50.480 --> 39:52.141
THAT I DON'T KNOW
YOUR LAST NAME.

39:52.190 --> 39:55.956
I MEAN, I ASSUME IT'S SOMETHING
LIKE "CORTEZ" OR "JINJOSA,"

39:55.990 --> 39:58.720
OR "PONCE DE LEON,"
BUT, UH, I WASN'T POSITIVE,

39:58.760 --> 40:00.728
SO I JUST, UH--
I WENT WITH SOMETHING SAFE.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.648
- THAT IS SAFE.
- IT'S GENIUS, SHAWN.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.565
THAT IS THE BEST FILM
I HAVE SEEN

40:04.600 --> 40:06.192
SINCE LOVE AND BASKETBALL.

40:06.230 --> 40:07.720
- WOW, THAT'S--

40:07.770 --> 40:09.135
- OH, UM,
I REALLY LIKED

40:09.170 --> 40:11.138
SOME OF THE NICE
EDITING CHOICES YOU MADE.

40:11.170 --> 40:12.831
THE DISSOLVE WAS GREAT.
AND, OOH!

40:12.870 --> 40:15.100
TH E--TH E FLASH BACK?
NICE TOUCH.

40:15.140 --> 40:18.871
- WELL, UH, THAT FLASHBACK
IS ACTUALLY HOW IT--

40:18.910 --> 40:21.447
HOW IT LOOKS IN MY HEAD,
THIS PSYCHIC BRAIN OF MINE.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.710
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE NICE
TO GIVE YOU GUYS A LITTLE PEEK

40:23.750 --> 40:25.718
INTO THE PROCESS
THAT I AM A SLAVE TO.

40:25.750 --> 40:27.615
- INTERESTING.

40:27.650 --> 40:29.857
PLEASE REMOVE YOUR ARM FROM
AROUND MY SHOULDER THIS SECOND.

40:29.890 --> 40:31.551
- YOU GOT IT, CHIEF.

40:31.590 --> 40:33.558
- YES, WELL, YOU'RE ALL
VERY LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

40:33.590 --> 40:35.524
THE SERBIANS
DON'T MESS AROUND.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.222
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE WEARING
MASKS AND SPEAKING SERBIAN.

40:38.260 --> 40:39.659
- WELL SAID, POP.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.497
I'M ALSO HAPPY TO REPORT

40:41.540 --> 40:43.895
THAT BIG ED WILL MAKE
A FULL RECOVERY.

40:43.940 --> 40:45.669
- MM-HMM.
- GOD LOVE HIM.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.132
AND IF I MAY
JUST ADD THAT,

40:47.170 --> 40:48.637
WHILE I'M NOT
PARTICULARLY PLEASED

40:48.680 --> 40:50.830
WITH HOW I'M PORTRAYED
IN THIS FILM,

40:54.180 --> 40:56.546
- YEAH!
[applause]

40:56.580 --> 40:57.945
- SHAWN, THANKS
FOR PUTTING THIS ALL TOGETHER.

40:57.980 --> 41:00.517
- IT WAS THE LEAST WE CAN DO.
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,

41:00.550 --> 41:02.586
YOU ARE GIVING UP
YOUR STUDENT ACADEMY AWARD

41:02.620 --> 41:03.985
BY OFFERING UP THIS FOOTAGE
AS EVIDENCE.

41:04.020 --> 41:05.885
- HOPEFULLY IT WILL BRING YOU
SOME COMFORT TO KNOW

41:05.930 --> 41:07.522
THAT THE REMAINING KILLER
WILL BE PROSECUTED

41:07.560 --> 41:08.959
TO THE FULL EXTENT
OF THE LAW.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.922
- WELL, IT ALL WORKED OUT
ABOUT AS WELL AS IT COULD

41:10.960 --> 41:13.599
CONSIDERING THAT MOST OF YOU
HAVE GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

41:13.630 --> 41:16.997
- YOU EVER BEEN SHOT,
PAPA BEAR?

41:17.040 --> 41:20.203
- YEAH. YEAH, AS A MATTER
OF FACT, I HAVE.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.708
- WOW. THAT'S SUPER HOT.

41:22.740 --> 41:25.208
- OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW,
SOME OF US DO HAVE TO GET BACK

41:25.250 --> 41:27.946
TO RUNNING A PRECINCT, SO--
- [chuckling]

41:27.980 --> 41:29.914
I APPRECIATE THAT, KAREN,
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE

41:29.950 --> 41:32.919
THAT DOES THE HEAW LIFTING
AROUND HERE.

41:32.950 --> 41:42.996
- DRIVE SAFE,
IF YOU DROVE.

41:43.000 --> 41:53.001
- DRIVE SAFE,
IF YOU DROVE.

51:44.560 --> 51:45.458
- "GOPHER"?
YOU CREDITED ME AS "GOPHER"?

51:45.500 --> 51:46.159
YOU MUST BE OUT
OF YOUR DAMN MIND, SHAWN.

51:46.200 --> 51:46.996
I PUT MY LIFE
ON THE LINE.

51:47.030 --> 51:47.724
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE C-CAMERA OPERATOR

51:47.770 --> 51:49.635
AND CO-PRODUCER.
WE HAD A DEAL.

51:49.670 --> 51:50.466
NOT TO MENTION
MY POINTS ON THE BACK END.

51:50.500 --> 51:51.239
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.

51:51.270 --> 51:51.531
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS UP
WITH POST.

51:51.570 --> 51:52.639
- COOL.

51:52.670 --> 51:57.209
WAIT A SECOND, YOU ARE POST.
GET BACK HERE, SHAWN!

52:03.720 --> 52:13.721
WAIT A SECOND, YOU ARE POST.
GET BACK HERE, SHAWN!
