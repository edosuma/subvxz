Well, then, no chores, no allowance.

it can happen to anyone.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.170
- I'm going for a corn dog. You want one?
- Yes.

14:03.275 --> 14:06.244
But first, there's a little matter
of the carny code.

14:06.345 --> 14:11.510

You're coming to stay at our house.

So, Mr. Cooder, how long have you been
