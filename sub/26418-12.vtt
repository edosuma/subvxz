00:01.175 --> 00:02.350
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:02.393 --> 00:03.525
Come back!

00:03.568 --> 00:05.614
I promised Axel I would
protect you.

00:05.657 --> 00:06.528
Jolene Walker?

00:06.571 --> 00:07.355
Yes?

00:07.398 --> 00:08.530
You're under arrest.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.097
I found her. I found Jennifer.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.316
They transferred her to some
place called The Love Land.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.970
Love Land's the prison colony.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.190
Unless you perform some heinous
crime you won't be seeing her

00:16.233 --> 00:17.974
any time soon.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.063
Where are all the prisoners?

00:20.107 --> 00:20.977
They're on the bus heading
to Love Land.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.109
The bus is leaving right now.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.067
Stop! Wait! Jolene!

00:24.111 --> 00:27.201
Meet me at that place
we talked about.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.289
Polly?

00:28.332 --> 00:29.464
That's my old name.

00:29.507 --> 00:30.900
You're my brother.

00:30.943 --> 00:37.341
Nothing will ever change that,
right?

00:37.385 --> 00:39.343
Today's the day.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.128
Today is the day.

00:41.171 --> 00:44.522
23 days on this goddamn island.

00:44.566 --> 00:48.222
I'm getting off,
I can feel it.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.527
What?

00:49.571 --> 00:50.485
You know what?

00:50.528 --> 00:51.660
If you're gonna criticize me

00:51.703 --> 00:53.053
I really don't wanna hear it,
alright?

00:53.096 --> 00:55.925
You are not a positive person.

00:55.968 --> 00:59.233
You know, the book
and my brains,

00:59.276 --> 01:02.018
you can will anything
into being, you know that?

01:02.062 --> 01:04.629
You could learn a little bit
from me.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.242
God, you're so judgemental.

01:08.285 --> 01:09.678
You know what?

01:09.721 --> 01:11.027
I thought we could have
a nicer good-bye than this.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.985
I was really hoping for it.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.816
We had really good times
together, Wilson.

01:19.644 --> 01:20.993
Psyche!

01:27.478 --> 01:29.480
See ya, Wilson, you sucker!

01:39.403 --> 01:41.144
Shut your mouth!

01:56.855 --> 02:00.207
There's gotta be a way
off this goddamn island.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.747
Yeah, I did that.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.968
And I did that.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.188
Man, I've done all of it.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.059
Useless book!

02:47.036 --> 02:49.865
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.899
♪ Saw you standing there,♪

03:23.942 --> 03:27.381
♪ You were looking
so nice...♪

03:29.774 --> 03:33.778
♪ The cherry lipstick makes
you look so...♪

03:38.130 --> 03:39.175
Axel?

03:41.569 --> 03:42.961
Axel!

03:43.005 --> 03:46.922
Hey! Axel!

03:46.965 --> 03:49.577
Hey! Hey!

03:49.620 --> 03:50.621
Axel!

03:54.321 --> 03:55.931
Hey!

03:55.974 --> 03:59.151
You said make it here and you
would wait as long as it took

03:59.195 --> 04:00.588
and you're driving off
right now?

04:00.631 --> 04:01.806
Hey, no, no, no.

04:01.850 --> 04:02.677
No, that's not what
you were doing?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.374
No, never.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.376
I was road-testing it.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.638
Hey.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.296
You look good.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.297
So do you.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.124
-You doing alright?
-Yeah.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.473
No fresh holes in you?

04:16.517 --> 04:19.868
No, not yet.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.043
You still got my dog tags.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.784
Yeah, of course I do.

04:22.827 --> 04:25.177
You wore them through two tours
of duty and the apocalypse.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.353
You think I was gonna lose them?

04:26.396 --> 04:27.832
Dude, I got these in
a gumball machine.

04:27.876 --> 04:28.746
Shut up.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.182
Come on.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.361
What's going on with you?

04:36.493 --> 04:37.929
Hey.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.845
You know that saying "you can
never go home again"?

04:40.889 --> 04:42.934
It just turned out to be true.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.284
Ok.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.548
I don't know what that means.

04:47.591 --> 04:48.375
Wanna get outta here?

04:48.418 --> 04:50.377
Yeah, I do.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.030
Alright.

04:52.074 --> 04:53.162
Where's your sister?

04:53.205 --> 04:54.816
Ugh.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.383
That's... ugh.

05:15.837 --> 05:18.492
Rumour is it's in a place called
Love Land.

05:18.535 --> 05:19.493
Let me guess.

05:19.536 --> 05:20.668
No beach resort.

05:20.711 --> 05:22.191
Nope.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.019
People go in but no one
comes out.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.455
Hey! You two!

05:25.499 --> 05:27.370
No talking.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.417
A death sentence.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.201
That's what this is.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.203
A one-way ticket to hell.

05:34.246 --> 05:35.030
I shouldn't be here.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.510
I didn't do anything.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.816
I just handed out leaflets
about shots causing rage.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.557
Shut your mouth!

05:49.566 --> 05:51.220
Don't.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.614
They're not gonna kill me.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.398
I'm gonna kill them first.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.878
All of them.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.706
Excuse me? Help.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.360
I need to change seats.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.535
What did I tell you?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.930
Woah, woah, woah,
woah, woah!

06:10.631 --> 06:12.546
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!

06:37.701 --> 06:39.181
Go, go, go, go, go!

06:48.669 --> 06:50.453
We're almost out of gas.

06:50.497 --> 06:54.239
Might be able to scrounge
some up here if we're lucky.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.171
I hope you brought
a rabbit's foot.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.651
This place looks like it's
been running on empty

07:14.695 --> 07:16.653
for a long time.

07:16.697 --> 07:19.961
You wanna walk
to Renfield House?

07:23.486 --> 07:26.358
You sure you wanna
go back there?

07:26.402 --> 07:28.360
We could always make
a run for it.

07:28.404 --> 07:32.669
Find a safe spot, make
some little baby ninjas.

07:32.713 --> 07:36.020
I've gotta be there for Vanessa
whether she wants me to or not.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.718
Fair enough.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.981
I go where you go.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.349
Ok, try it again.

08:02.438 --> 08:03.352
Told you.

08:03.395 --> 08:04.875
Goddammit.

08:04.919 --> 08:07.356
The fuel's good, it's just gotta
be the pump relay again.

08:07.399 --> 08:10.011
Just... hand me that tool box?

08:13.231 --> 08:14.363
Scarlett?

08:14.406 --> 08:15.407
Yeah?

08:19.107 --> 08:21.501
Do you hear that?

08:24.939 --> 08:26.549
That's a little weird.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.914
What is that?

08:55.622 --> 08:57.275
Is that morse code?

08:58.276 --> 09:00.496
Sounds like SOS.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.169
Son of a bitch.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.452
Ahhhhhh!!!!!

10:28.366 --> 10:29.367
Axel!

10:39.029 --> 10:40.640
Hey! Hey!

10:40.683 --> 10:42.859
Hey, it's- it's me.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.601
Axel.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.560
Hey.

10:48.604 --> 10:49.779
I- I can't see.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.349
I- I can't see.
I can't see.

10:54.392 --> 10:55.655
Shit.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.398
Such a stupid mistake.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.705
You couldn't have known.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.577
I shoulda seen there was
something jammed in the barrel.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.014
Don't worry, we're gonna
get you some help.

11:07.057 --> 11:09.059
Come on, just trust me.

11:11.932 --> 11:14.717
How're you gonna find help?

11:14.761 --> 11:16.719
Have a little faith,
would ya?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.242
I told you, I saw that guy.

11:18.286 --> 11:19.417
He's gotta be around
here somewhere.

11:19.461 --> 11:20.592
What guy?

11:20.636 --> 11:21.811
The one, I told you.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.204
Oh my god.

11:23.247 --> 11:25.859
Hey! Hey!

11:25.902 --> 11:27.425
A little help here!

11:29.558 --> 11:32.909
Goodness, what have you done
to your face?

11:32.953 --> 11:35.738
Oh, accident at
the tanning salon.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.261
Let's put him down
on the cot over here.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.089
Just throw that stuff off.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.569
Ok.

11:40.612 --> 11:41.396
You're good.

11:41.439 --> 11:42.440
Coming forward.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.703
Turn around now.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.400
Here we go.

11:45.443 --> 11:48.098
Ok, and sit.

11:48.142 --> 11:49.056
Take off your jacket.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.058
Ok.

11:52.102 --> 11:55.410
It was some old shot gun,
blew up on him.

11:55.453 --> 11:58.674
Never did like those things,
they are so dangerous.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.154
Oh, come on.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.633
I love guns.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.157
Only thing you can count on
in this world.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.813
Yeah, well looking at you right
now I would beg to differ.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.119
Here lift your head up.
There we go.

12:10.468 --> 12:11.556
Ok, there's a... first aid
kit in the truck.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.645
Grab that for me, please.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.038
What's your name, son?

12:15.082 --> 12:17.737
It's uh... Axel.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.042
Happy to make your acquaintance
Axel.

12:19.086 --> 12:23.220
No, no, no... Simon.

12:23.264 --> 12:24.569
Hey, Simon.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.789
You got yourself in quite
a pickle, didn't ya.

12:26.833 --> 12:27.964
What did you say?

12:28.008 --> 12:29.139
Just be still now.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.662
I need to take a closer look.

12:30.706 --> 12:34.797
There's a saline solution
in there, grab that for me.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.757
Ok, now you need to try to keep
your eyes open.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.627
Ok.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.324
I can rinse out the residue.

12:40.368 --> 12:41.804
It's likely gonna hurt.

12:41.848 --> 12:42.500
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

12:42.544 --> 12:43.327
Ok.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.328
Trust me.

12:44.372 --> 12:45.286
Here we go.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.680
Son of a bitch!

12:48.724 --> 12:51.248
That's right, good, good, good.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.903
Here we go.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.122
Ok.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.000
Come on! You can do it!

13:04.044 --> 13:04.827
You can do it!

13:04.871 --> 13:05.872
I can't do it!

13:05.915 --> 13:07.003
I need something better
than this.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.526
I need pliers or a saw
or something-

13:08.570 --> 13:10.964
We don't have anything else,
just give it a- try again.

13:11.007 --> 13:12.748
Just try again.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.537
You're stuck with me.

13:24.020 --> 13:24.804
It's getting dark.

13:24.847 --> 13:25.543
What do you wanna do?

13:25.587 --> 13:26.631
We hold up here.

13:26.675 --> 13:27.894
We lost them crossing
that river.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.157
Are you sure?

13:30.200 --> 13:31.723
No, but pessimism
wasn't working for me

13:31.767 --> 13:34.248
so I thought I'd try
the opposite.

13:52.701 --> 13:55.008
Ok, it's my turn.

13:55.051 --> 13:58.359
I don't think we're gonna
be able to escape these guys.

14:02.537 --> 14:05.148
This is gonna sound crazy
but I was the only person

14:05.192 --> 14:07.847
on that bus that didn't
want to escape. It's...

14:12.503 --> 14:15.506
It's my wife, Jennifer.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.594
I think she's alive.

14:16.638 --> 14:19.467
I think she might be
in that place.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.860
You wanted to bust her out?

14:20.903 --> 14:26.735
No, just... talk to her,
if she'd see me.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.871
Tell her...

14:37.789 --> 14:39.400
I don't know.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.883
I can't go with you.

14:45.232 --> 14:48.670
I know that, but you can't
go back, either.

14:48.713 --> 14:51.020
I gotta try.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.196
I gotta find Sarah.

14:55.764 --> 14:56.765
Well...

14:59.289 --> 15:01.901
I guess we're at an impasse.

15:15.001 --> 15:19.483
You love her.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.355
Yeah.

15:21.398 --> 15:24.488
I do.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.491
And her?

15:29.102 --> 15:36.326
It's... well, she's um...
complicated.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.458
It always is.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.982
There's no such thing
as pure love.

15:40.026 --> 15:43.377
That optimism didn't last long.

15:55.867 --> 15:59.959
Jennifer and I, we um...

16:00.002 --> 16:04.311
we got pregnant after we had
been together three weeks.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.488
Stupid, right?

16:09.446 --> 16:15.975
There we were, so uh...
we got married,

16:16.018 --> 16:19.413
and sometimes you just fall
into things.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.415
But it all worked out, right?

16:21.458 --> 16:22.546
Oh yeah, it all worked out,

16:22.590 --> 16:23.634
right up until I murdered
our kids.

16:23.678 --> 16:26.072
It all worked out
right until then.

16:42.697 --> 16:43.785
I thought if I could
kill myself.

16:43.828 --> 16:45.047
I thought I could clean
the slate

16:45.091 --> 16:46.788
or balance the scales but...

16:50.183 --> 16:52.663
you have to deal
with the consequences.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.709
I have to face them. I...

16:59.105 --> 17:01.933
I have to face her.

17:06.634 --> 17:10.855
There's something
I told Sarah once.

17:10.899 --> 17:16.557
You want forgiveness you
gotta forgive yourself first.

17:21.475 --> 17:24.826
You think you could do that?

17:33.487 --> 17:34.488
You should come eat your fish.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.881
It's getting cold.

17:38.318 --> 17:39.841
Is he gonna be ok?

17:39.884 --> 17:41.451
That's not up to us.

17:41.495 --> 17:44.106
They're pretty bad burns.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.152
It's in his hands now.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.026
Really?

17:55.683 --> 17:57.815
Just all up to the big man
in the sky?

17:59.556 --> 18:03.125
You don't believe.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.344
My parents taught me
a lot of things

18:04.387 --> 18:09.131
but that was not one of them.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.873
I mean, take a look around.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.267
This place is overrun
by vampires.

18:14.310 --> 18:17.183
Not exactly a solid argument
for divinity.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.836
Isn't it?

18:18.880 --> 18:21.012
Scriptures of the world
are filled with stories of-

18:21.056 --> 18:22.492
Seriously?

18:22.536 --> 18:23.667
Oh, sure.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.844
Sins of man, the consequences
of that.

18:26.888 --> 18:31.284
Wouldn't be the first time
God gave himself a do-over.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.938
So what, this is just
all punishment?

18:33.982 --> 18:39.205
For not being faithful?

18:39.248 --> 18:43.252
Do not take lightly the
discipline of the Lord,

18:43.296 --> 18:47.430
for the Lord disciplines
the ones that he loves.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.180
Mmm.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.486
Pretty good.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.531
Yeah.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.751
Teach a man to fish,
right?

19:03.794 --> 19:08.059
Oh, amongst other things.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.887
What were you doing out there?

19:09.931 --> 19:11.193
I mean, you just walked
right by us

19:11.237 --> 19:12.760
when we were fighting
all those daywalkers,

19:12.803 --> 19:14.370
like you didn't have a care
in the world.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.416
I don't.

19:16.459 --> 19:19.332
You don't even have weapons
around here.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.550
I'm a pacifist.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.552
What?

19:22.596 --> 19:23.727
What?

19:23.771 --> 19:27.078
Come on, how are you even alive?

19:27.122 --> 19:28.123
Faith?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.691
Why is that so hard
to grasp?

19:30.734 --> 19:33.911
Because I've seen people
ripped apart.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.391
I've seen those things feeding
on my friends

19:35.435 --> 19:36.784
and turning them
and it didn't matter

19:36.827 --> 19:38.960
what they believed or not.

19:39.003 --> 19:41.397
No higher power saved them.

19:41.441 --> 19:47.838
So either you're delusional
or... I don't even know what.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.581
I used to be a lot like you.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.541
Angry, afraid, and trying
to protect myself

19:54.584 --> 19:57.892
from everything and everyone.

19:57.935 --> 19:59.241
It's called survival.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.808
Mmm.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.941
Let me tell you a little
about survival.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.074
Years before the rising
I lived different.

20:06.117 --> 20:09.817
I was a long-haul trucker,
on the road

20:09.860 --> 20:13.995
sometimes 14 hours straight
10 days in a row.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.650
Drugs were the only thing
that kept me going.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.434
I paid the price.

20:18.478 --> 20:23.265
Wife left, took my kids,
nothing left I cared about.

20:23.309 --> 20:26.137
Considered ending it all
right there.

20:26.181 --> 20:29.619
Why didn't you?

20:29.663 --> 20:34.929
Well, I was on a stretch of
blacktop outside of Fort Worth.

20:34.972 --> 20:38.019
Clearest day you could imagine.

20:38.062 --> 20:41.849
Out of nowhere a twister
just dropped right down

20:41.892 --> 20:45.331
in the field next to me, bam.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.289
I knew I couldn't stay
in my rig.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.335
There was no buildings around,
no place to hide,

20:49.378 --> 20:56.342
except a lone phone booth set
out in an empty parking lot.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.518
So I ran.

20:58.561 --> 21:02.826
Crawled in there on my hands
and knees and right then,

21:02.870 --> 21:04.959
with the wind ripping all around

21:05.002 --> 21:11.748
and the sky going dark
as coal, it happened.

21:11.792 --> 21:14.882
I closed my eyes and I prayed.

21:14.925 --> 21:19.103
Please just give me one
more chance to be better.

21:19.147 --> 21:22.629
To live right.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.500
To make amends.

21:24.544 --> 21:28.504
Please God, just let me
have that.

21:28.548 --> 21:31.290
And then everything
went quiet.

21:31.333 --> 21:35.598
The storm disappeared like
it never even happened.

21:35.642 --> 21:38.514
I crawled out of there.

21:38.558 --> 21:47.741
My whole truck was gone,
everything was wiped clean.

21:47.784 --> 21:50.613
And then I knew.

22:02.408 --> 22:07.326
There's nothing really
divine about that story.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.371
It's just luck,
plain and simple,

22:09.415 --> 22:13.810
and you can't even really
will that into being.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.377
You know?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.031
You just can't.

22:17.074 --> 22:20.164
Well then, you just keep right
on hoping for Axel to get better

22:20.208 --> 22:24.560
and I'm gonna pray on it
a little while

22:24.604 --> 22:27.389
if it's all the same to you.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.434
Ok.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.326
I'd say you're a sight
for sore eyes, but...

22:52.283 --> 22:54.460
Shut up, marine.

23:01.771 --> 23:04.121
Just focus on getting better.

23:08.648 --> 23:09.953
Hey.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.260
I think he's got a fever.

23:12.303 --> 23:13.348
Hopefully.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.567
What does that mean?

23:14.610 --> 23:16.438
Well, I am worried
he's got an infection.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.832
Ok, but you can treat that,
right?

23:18.875 --> 23:21.661
Not without antibiotics, no.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.184
I don't- I don't think
you understand.

23:23.227 --> 23:24.838
I need him to get better.

23:24.881 --> 23:26.405
It's not up to me.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.928
Ok, can you stop
with that shit?

23:27.971 --> 23:29.364
This is not a spiritual
thing right now.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.975
He needs medicine.

23:40.244 --> 23:43.247
Well, there might be a place
where we might be able

23:43.291 --> 23:44.553
to find it but it's-

23:44.597 --> 23:46.468
I don't- I don't care.
We just gotta go there.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.035
Well, you should stay here
with him.

23:48.078 --> 23:50.254
And risk you not coming back?
No way.

23:50.298 --> 23:51.691
I don't need
your protection.

23:51.734 --> 23:53.388
I'm not asking you.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.523
The faster we do this
the better chance he has.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.568
So let's go. Please.

24:03.093 --> 24:03.964
Come on.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.531
What do I- What do I gotta do?

24:05.574 --> 24:07.533
Do I need to say that I believe
that your God's chosen one

24:07.576 --> 24:10.013
before you get on board?

24:10.057 --> 24:12.363
You- you- you think I use
my faith as a weapon?

24:12.407 --> 24:14.322
I have no idea.

24:14.365 --> 24:18.544
It's the greatest shield
you can possibly imagine.

24:19.588 --> 24:22.939
I- I- I don't understand what
that means but I-

24:22.983 --> 24:24.288
I have to go, now.

24:24.332 --> 24:25.202
Please.

24:25.246 --> 24:25.986
We have to help him.

24:26.029 --> 24:28.510
Ok.

24:28.554 --> 24:29.642
There's no charge on the truck,

24:29.685 --> 24:31.731
it's about an hour's walk
from here.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.255
He won't need it but if
it makes you feel better,

24:34.298 --> 24:35.517
I'll leave him his gun.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.388
No, he's coming with us.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.129
Well, if we take him
he's gonna slow us down.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.653
I don't care.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.702
Boy oh boy.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.487
A firecracker, that one.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.285
Daddy!

25:11.074 --> 25:13.555
...one last
building here to check.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.602
Copy. Report to waypoint tango
if zero contact.

25:16.645 --> 25:19.866
But orders remain shoot to kill
if eyes on targets.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.868
Roger that, out.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.133
Did we...

26:10.177 --> 26:12.962
I'm not killing him
unless we have to, alright?

26:15.095 --> 26:17.010
They're coming for us.

26:17.053 --> 26:18.751
They're coming for us
no matter what we do.

26:20.796 --> 26:21.623
The gun.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.146
Where's the gun?

26:23.799 --> 26:24.670
Put your hand on the door frame.

26:24.713 --> 26:25.322
What?

26:25.366 --> 26:26.454
Just do it!

26:26.497 --> 26:28.195
Come on! Do it!

26:28.238 --> 26:30.240
Put your hand on the door frame.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.157
Now look away.

26:34.201 --> 26:35.332
Close your eyes.

26:37.857 --> 26:40.033
We gotta get outta here!

26:40.076 --> 26:41.295
Come on.

26:41.338 --> 26:41.861
Go.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.210
Go, go, go, go!

26:49.303 --> 26:51.131
This way. This way!

26:52.785 --> 26:57.354
Ok. Here we go.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.181
This is great.

26:58.225 --> 26:59.356
Yeah.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.097
There's gotta be antibiotics
in there.

27:03.230 --> 27:04.361
I'll check it out.

27:04.405 --> 27:06.189
Hurry up.

27:29.256 --> 27:31.475
Ask and you shall receive.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.089
That's good.

27:36.132 --> 27:37.743
Yeah, that's good.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.094
Let's get outta here.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.706
One, two, three.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.404
What'd I miss?

28:01.854 --> 28:04.117
Your fever is down,
so that's good.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.422
Let's see what we got.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.777
Ugh.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.343
Sorry.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.697
Can you open your eyes?

28:24.180 --> 28:25.704
I can see light, that's it.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.489
Ok, well what did you expect?

28:28.532 --> 28:30.360
You're not gonna get better
all at once.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.101
It's gonna take some time.

28:32.885 --> 28:33.712
Sorry.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.539
It's alright.

28:37.411 --> 28:38.673
Ok, I'm just gonna change
the dressing

28:38.717 --> 28:40.719
and and we'll see
what tomorrow brings.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.679
Ok, I'm going on.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.203
Lift your head up.

28:47.247 --> 28:48.814
You think she's there already?

28:48.857 --> 28:50.337
At Renfield House, Vanessa?

28:50.380 --> 28:52.556
Maybe. She could be.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.428
It's ok.

28:55.777 --> 28:57.213
What's she even doing there?

28:57.257 --> 28:59.955
I'm assuming something
with the fourth elder.

28:59.999 --> 29:02.349
You think she's gonna do
the right thing,

29:02.392 --> 29:03.480
destroy those totems?

29:03.524 --> 29:06.788
No, I don't.

29:06.832 --> 29:12.446
If she goes dark like that elder
that you found on the island,

29:12.489 --> 29:15.275
are you prepared to do
what you gotta do?

29:18.060 --> 29:20.367
Hey, we should go.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.717
Before it gets dark.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.721
What's that?

29:35.512 --> 29:36.905
Oh god. This is bad.

29:36.949 --> 29:37.645
What?

29:37.688 --> 29:39.255
This is bad.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.518
It's a bunch of daywalkers and
they're walking right at us.

29:41.562 --> 29:42.650
We gotta get-

29:42.693 --> 29:44.739
Axel, lie down.
You can't fight them.

29:44.783 --> 29:45.479
Yes I can.

29:45.522 --> 29:46.306
I can try.

29:46.349 --> 29:47.481
You'll die.

29:47.524 --> 29:48.656
You know what?

29:48.699 --> 29:49.918
At least I can create
a diversion.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.528
If you're going out
I'm going out with you.

29:51.572 --> 29:53.792
There's no way I'm hanging out
in this shit hole by myself.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.619
Nobody's gonna die.

29:55.663 --> 29:57.360
Sit still and quiet.

29:57.404 --> 29:59.275
I promise we'll be safe.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.495
This is not a solution.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.366
Ok, they're coming,
they're coming.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.393
Stay still.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.196
They're gone.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.894
God's will.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.726
As soon as he's able to walk
again we're gonna take off.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.773
And just take the antibiotics
with us.

31:46.861 --> 31:48.428
What?

31:48.471 --> 31:50.778
The antibiotics are not working.

31:50.821 --> 31:53.085
His fever is back
and it's worse.

31:53.128 --> 31:55.739
Ok, well then we'll keep at it.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.393
I- I think there's something
you need to accept here.

31:57.437 --> 32:02.094
Axel may not be coming back
at all.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.270
You said he's getting better.

32:04.313 --> 32:06.054
You said that anything
is possible.

32:06.098 --> 32:08.796
I mean, what's all this talk
about prayer?

32:08.839 --> 32:12.104
Prayer is good, but he's not
a genie that grants wishes.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.409
No, apparently not.

32:13.453 --> 32:15.063
Apparently, he's just a cruel
son of a bitch

32:15.107 --> 32:16.935
that just strikes people down
when they don't deserve it.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.501
Look, even if we don't
understand him,

32:18.545 --> 32:19.459
God has his reasons.

32:19.502 --> 32:21.156
Ugh. Stop.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.201
Scarlett-

32:22.244 --> 32:23.898
Enough.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.689
Listen to me.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.387
I gotta tell you some stuff.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.780
We got a lot of time, ok?

32:36.824 --> 32:37.564
Just rest.

32:37.607 --> 32:40.349
Just let me talk.

32:42.395 --> 32:47.487
I didn't wanna tell you
but I don't really know why.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.402
I found my sister.

32:49.445 --> 32:52.492
What?

32:52.535 --> 33:01.022
She's been there the whole time,
just...

33:01.066 --> 33:06.462
I lost my sister but you still
got time to save yours.

33:06.506 --> 33:08.595
And we will.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.423
As soon as you're feeling better
we'll go.

33:10.466 --> 33:13.339
We both know that's
not where I'm headed.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.994
Don't say that.

33:16.037 --> 33:19.084
Ok, I'll try to hang on.

33:19.127 --> 33:26.439
I promise you I will,
but... you gotta go to her.

33:26.482 --> 33:27.309
Now.

33:27.353 --> 33:31.879
No.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.881
And if I'm not here when you
get back you listen to me-

33:33.924 --> 33:39.365
No.

33:39.408 --> 33:46.024
I love you, Scarlett.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.069
I always will.

34:32.809 --> 34:34.942
You piece of shit.

34:38.380 --> 34:42.080
Take a good look,
it's gonna be your last.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.225
What in heaven's-

34:57.269 --> 34:58.966
Move outta the way!

34:59.009 --> 34:59.662
I- I don't-

34:59.706 --> 35:01.534
Sit down! Get down!

35:01.577 --> 35:02.622
Listen here.

35:02.665 --> 35:03.884
I don't know if
you can understand,

35:03.927 --> 35:06.800
if this virus makes you smart
enough or not,

35:06.843 --> 35:08.323
but you are going to bite him.

35:08.367 --> 35:09.759
What're you doing?

35:09.803 --> 35:12.197
I don't believe in miracles
and I'm out of options.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.242
Bite him!

35:16.810 --> 35:20.596
I said, bite him!

35:31.259 --> 35:31.912
Alright.

35:31.955 --> 35:32.956
Stop!

35:33.000 --> 35:34.132
It did what you asked,
let it go.

35:34.175 --> 35:35.002
Move out of my way!

35:35.045 --> 35:35.872
I'm gonna kill him.

35:35.916 --> 35:36.917
That's what I do, ok?

35:36.960 --> 35:38.658
He does not deserve to live.

35:38.701 --> 35:39.876
And what will that change?

35:39.920 --> 35:42.488
Will it do anything at all
for Axel?

35:42.531 --> 35:44.142
Let it go.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.493
Get out of here!

35:47.536 --> 35:48.885
Go!

35:48.929 --> 35:49.930
Run!

35:58.373 --> 36:02.377
Oh, come on, Axel.

36:05.032 --> 36:06.425
Come on.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.127
Hey.

36:14.389 --> 36:15.738
Axel.

36:17.349 --> 36:18.350
Hey.

36:18.393 --> 36:19.351
Hey.

36:19.394 --> 36:20.917
Hi!

36:31.580 --> 36:33.234
Axel...

36:39.762 --> 36:40.763
Peek-a-boo.

36:47.074 --> 36:47.988
Now what?

36:48.031 --> 36:49.294
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:49.337 --> 36:52.819
This is the road where
the bus crashed.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.951
That means...

36:54.995 --> 36:58.868
Denver's that way so the prison
must be this way.

36:58.912 --> 37:01.262
So this is it?

37:01.306 --> 37:02.742
You gotta do what you gotta do.

37:02.785 --> 37:03.786
You're a good man, Phil.

37:03.830 --> 37:05.397
Believe that.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.792
Drop your weapon! Now!

37:09.836 --> 37:13.056
Put it on the ground,
hands on your head.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.710
Put it on the ground.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.061
Control, I got 'em.
Both of 'em.

37:18.105 --> 37:18.845
Please, don't do this.

37:18.888 --> 37:21.326
Shut up! Don't move.

37:21.369 --> 37:22.936
Want me to cuff them
or just wait for back-up?

37:22.979 --> 37:25.112
The orders were shoot
to kill the fugitives.

37:25.155 --> 37:25.939
Listen.

37:25.982 --> 37:26.809
Carry out your orders.

37:26.853 --> 37:27.854
I'm surrendering, alright?

37:27.897 --> 37:31.814
Take me into custody, alright?

37:31.858 --> 37:32.902
You- you don't have to do this.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.948
Let- let- let her go.

37:34.991 --> 37:36.776
I can't do that.

37:36.819 --> 37:38.952
You don't wanna kill me.

37:38.995 --> 37:39.996
You don't have to.

37:40.040 --> 37:43.348
Hunter five, what's your status

37:43.391 --> 37:45.654
The others on the bus,
they're all dead because of you.

37:45.698 --> 37:46.307
No.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.308
No, no, no.

37:47.352 --> 37:48.527
That had nothing to do with us.

37:48.570 --> 37:49.441
Take me in and I'll explain
everything.

37:49.484 --> 37:50.746
No.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.313
No.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.968
If I don't follow orders I get
sent to Love Land as well.

37:56.186 --> 37:58.580
They know you're alive.

37:58.624 --> 38:00.495
I don't have a choice.

38:01.279 --> 38:01.801
No, no, no!

38:01.844 --> 38:02.541
Don't! Don't!

38:12.028 --> 38:14.988
Hunter five, report,
goddammit!

38:19.819 --> 38:22.430
Two tangos down,
I killed them.

38:22.474 --> 38:24.040
Both of them.

38:47.803 --> 38:48.587
Did you...

38:48.630 --> 38:50.371
Yeah.

38:52.460 --> 38:55.768
Are you ok?

38:55.811 --> 38:57.204
I'm fine.

38:57.247 --> 38:58.379
Keys.

38:58.423 --> 39:01.077
Keys, keys, keys.

39:01.904 --> 39:03.210
You took a bullet for me.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.386
Three, actually.

39:05.430 --> 39:06.387
Got 'em.

39:06.431 --> 39:07.388
You can't go back to Denver now.

39:07.432 --> 39:11.044
Are you coming?

39:11.087 --> 39:12.175
I help you find your wife,

39:12.219 --> 39:14.047
you help me get back to Sarah,
deal?

39:14.090 --> 39:16.136
If we live that long.

39:30.019 --> 39:32.587
What's your twenty?

39:44.599 --> 39:46.645
So I guess this is goodbye.

39:46.688 --> 39:49.909
Oh, why don't we call it
"happy trails" instead?

39:49.952 --> 39:51.780
We don't know
what the future holds.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.609
Our paths might
cross again someday,

39:54.653 --> 39:56.916
if it's God's will.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.352
I'll give you this.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.441
You're one of the luckiest guys
I've ever run into.

40:00.485 --> 40:04.271
Well, I told you luck isn't
real, but faith...

40:04.314 --> 40:05.751
Ok, I wasn't gonna
say anything.

40:05.794 --> 40:06.491
Mmmhmm?

40:06.534 --> 40:07.579
Remember the ambulance?

40:07.622 --> 40:08.318
Sure.

40:08.362 --> 40:09.929
Ok.

40:09.972 --> 40:13.323
You would have been killed
by a feral if it wasn't for me.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.195
So where was divine
intervention then?

40:15.238 --> 40:18.851
Oh, I'm looking right at it.

40:18.894 --> 40:21.897
He brought you to me,
didn't he?

40:25.858 --> 40:28.687
Your friend needs something
for his eyes.

40:30.079 --> 40:31.951
Look after yourself.

40:31.994 --> 40:37.173
Peace be with you wherever
your journey takes you.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.699
Axel?

41:00.501 --> 41:01.763
Well, he was different.

41:01.807 --> 41:03.591
He saved your life.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.332
Are you kidding me?

41:05.375 --> 41:07.682
I was on my way out if it
hadn't been for you.

41:07.726 --> 41:09.728
That is kinda true.

41:09.771 --> 41:12.861
You gotta admit, some crazy
shit happened.

41:14.123 --> 41:15.690
Hold on, are you buying

41:15.734 --> 41:18.476
this whole prophet in
the wilderness thing?

41:18.519 --> 41:22.262
No, but how do you explain
the daywalkers passing us?

41:22.305 --> 41:23.132
A miracle.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.788
Seriously, I'm glad you
brought me back

41:26.832 --> 41:28.007
but you really want me
to believe

41:28.050 --> 41:29.574
it's 'cause God intervened?

41:29.617 --> 41:31.532
No, but I'm just...

41:31.576 --> 41:33.534
we don't have all the answers,
that's all.

41:33.578 --> 41:34.448
I don't.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.058
Mmmhmm.

41:36.102 --> 41:37.190
Looks like I'm not the only one

41:37.233 --> 41:39.497
who got a little blinded
back there.
