WEBVTT

00:10.144 --> 00:12.446
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE, SIX *

00:12.480 --> 00:13.647
* SHAKE IT, DUDE

00:13.681 --> 00:21.589
*

00:35.436 --> 00:38.272
- * CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:38.306 --> 00:46.280
*

00:46.314 --> 00:49.817
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:49.850 --> 00:53.587
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:53.621 --> 00:57.125
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:59.227 --> 01:03.164
- * SONNY MAKES ME SUNNY

01:03.197 --> 01:09.103
* HE MAKES THE SKIES
WATCH OVER ME *

01:09.137 --> 01:11.105
- BETTER NOT BE A PARAKEET
IN THERE, JANE.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.207
- HUH?

01:13.241 --> 01:15.876
- OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE NOT UP
ON YOUR GAY FILM HISTORY.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.112
WHAT EVER HAPPENED
TO BABY JANE?

01:18.146 --> 01:19.847
STARRING THE TWO GREATEST
BITCH GODDESSES

01:19.880 --> 01:21.782
IN THE HISTORY
OF THE HUMAN RACE:

01:21.815 --> 01:24.452
MISS JOAN CRAWFORD
AND MISS BETTE DAVIS.

01:24.485 --> 01:28.256
"MS. CRAWFORD AND I
NE-E-EVER GOT ALONG."

01:28.289 --> 01:30.858
- I NE-E-EVER SAW IT.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.394
- I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO POINT
EVEN MENTIONING ESTHER BLODGETT.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.130
- I KNOW THAT ONE.
IT'S A STAR IS BORN, RIGHT?

01:36.164 --> 01:39.333
- OH, THANK GOD.
HE REALLY IS GAY.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.869
- EAT.
- NO THANKS.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.604
- IT'S TUNA SALAD,
NOT PARAKEET.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.206
- I'M NOT HUNGRY.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.407
- WELL, YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED YOUR STRENGTH.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.210
- [scoffs]
FOR WHAT?

01:49.243 --> 01:51.912
THE DOCTOR SAYS
I MIGHT HAVE A PERMANENT LIMP.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.148
THAT SHOULD
BRIGHTEN UP MY ACT.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.749
- WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING
TO THE DOCTORS FOR?

01:55.783 --> 01:58.352
AFTER THEY STUFFED MY BRAIN
BACK INTO MY HEAD,

01:58.386 --> 01:59.820
THEY TOLD ME
I'D NEVER DRAW AGAIN.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.823
- AND DO YOU?
- YES...

02:02.856 --> 02:06.394
FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES,
THEN MY HAND STARTS TO SHAKE,

02:06.427 --> 02:08.496
SO I USE A COMPUTER.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.697
BUT THE POINT IS--

02:09.730 --> 02:11.232
- YOU WENT ON!

02:11.265 --> 02:14.335
- RIGHT.
SO WILL YOU.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.908
- YOU'RE SO...

02:20.941 --> 02:24.378
REASONABLE.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.846
I KEEP HOPING
WHEN THEY CATCH MY BASHERS,

02:25.879 --> 02:27.815
THEY'LL SENTENCE THEM
TO LIFE IN PRISON,

02:27.848 --> 02:31.252
AND THEY'LL GET FUCKED NIGHTLY
BY PRISONERS WITH AIDS.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.653
- THAT'S GRUESOME.

02:32.686 --> 02:36.290
- DOESN'T COST ANYTHING
TO DREAM.

02:37.958 --> 02:42.263
WHEN IT HAPPENED TO YOU,
WEREN'T YOU ANGRY?

02:42.296 --> 02:44.398
- I TRIED
NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

02:44.432 --> 02:47.968
- I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.438
I SEE THEIR FACES,

02:50.471 --> 02:54.275
THEIR BOOTS
SMASHING INTO ME.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.311
I EVEN HUGGED THIS ONE GUY'S
FOOT TO MY STOMACH,

02:57.345 --> 03:01.482
HOPING IT'D STOP HIM
FROM KICKING ME.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.684
IT DIDN'T.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.953
- IF YOU'RE STILL
HOLDING ONTO THAT BOOT,

03:05.986 --> 03:08.889
THEN YOU'RE STILL
ON THE GROUND TAKING IT.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.560
FORGET ABOUT IT.
- LISTEN, IF YOU'D BEEN

03:12.593 --> 03:15.829
REDUCED TO JERKING OFF
WITH YOUR LEFT HAND,

03:15.863 --> 03:17.898
YOU'D WANT THEM DEAD TOO.

03:17.931 --> 03:22.870
[laughs]

03:22.903 --> 03:25.839
- [groans]

03:25.873 --> 03:28.309
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, BABY?
TUMMY ACHE?

03:28.342 --> 03:29.877
- [groans]

03:29.910 --> 03:32.580
- WHAT IS IT, MICHAEL,
A MIGRAINE?

03:32.613 --> 03:34.982
- IMPACTED WISDOM TEETH.
UGH.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.718
- BUT YOU HAD THEM ALL
EXTRACTED.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.320
- EMMETT DOESN'T
KNOW THAT.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.454
- [scoffs]
- OH.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.390
- WHAT POSSESSED ME?

03:42.423 --> 03:44.458
WHY DID I EVER AGREE
TO GO WITH HIM?

03:44.492 --> 03:46.327
- BECAUSE YOU'RE
A GOOD-HEARTED HUMAN BEING

03:46.360 --> 03:47.995
WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR HIS FRIEND.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.997
- CAUSE I'M
A LAME-BRAINED DOORMAT

03:50.030 --> 03:51.399
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY NO.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.334
- IT'LL ONLY BE
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.035
- FEELS MORE LIKE
AN ETERNITY.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.505
- WE'VE DISCUSSED THESE RADICAL
FAIRY GATHERINGS IN MY CLASS.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.407
THIS GUY, HARRY HAY...

03:59.440 --> 04:00.941
- I'VE HEARD OF HIM.
- STARTED THEM IN THE '70s.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.343
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
A VERY EMPOWERING

04:02.376 --> 04:04.011
AND ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCE.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.480
- WELL, IF THEY'RE SO EMPOWERING
AND ENLIGHTENING,

04:06.514 --> 04:07.748
WHY DON'T YOU GO?

04:07.781 --> 04:10.484
- I HAVE CLASSES,
THERE'S HUNTER.

04:10.518 --> 04:13.487
ANYWAY, EMMETT ASKED YOU,
NOT ME.

04:13.521 --> 04:16.524
- I'M NOT GOING.
NO WAY, NO WAY.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.392
- DARREN ASKED ME
TO THANK YOU

04:18.426 --> 04:19.793
FOR ALL THE FOOD
YOU'VE SENT HIM, DEB.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.629
- THE POOR KID.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

04:21.662 --> 04:22.963
- HOW'S HE DOING?

04:22.996 --> 04:24.498
- I'M AFRAID
IT'S GOING TO BE A WHILE

04:24.532 --> 04:26.500
BEFORE SHANDA LEER
APPEARS IN PUBLIC AGAIN.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.702
- WELL, AT LEAST HE HAS
ONE RAY OF SUNSHINE IN HIS LIFE.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.938
- TELL HIM WE'LL MISS HIM
AT THE CENTER TONIGHT,

04:30.971 --> 04:35.643
BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE
THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.044
- HI, EM.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.380
- UGH.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.450
- WELL, ARE YOU READY
TO FIND YOUR INNER FAIRY?

04:42.483 --> 04:44.718
- WHEN I DO, I JUST HOPE
HE LOOKS MORE LIKE TINKER BELL

04:44.752 --> 04:46.086
THAN CAPTAIN HOOK.
[laughter]

04:46.119 --> 04:47.388
- [groans]
- [scoffs]

04:47.421 --> 04:48.689
- YOU ALL PACKED?

04:48.722 --> 04:53.427
- EM, I--
- UH, BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING...

04:53.461 --> 04:54.828
AS WE ALL KNOW,
I HAVE BEEN

04:54.862 --> 04:56.997
GOING THROUGH SOME
PRETTY TOUGH TIMES LATELY.

04:57.030 --> 05:00.401
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
MY HEADLIGHTS ARE ON LOW BEAM,

05:00.434 --> 05:04.672
BUT IF THIS FAIRY FROLIC
WILL TURN THE BRIGHTS BACK ON,

05:04.705 --> 05:07.441
WELL, WHAT THE FUCK,
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.611
- MORE POWER TO YOU,
SWEETHEART.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.014
- WHATEVER HAPPENS,
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

05:14.047 --> 05:19.420
I WILL ALWAYS--ALWAYS
BE GRATEFUL THAT YOUR SON,

05:19.453 --> 05:23.724
YOUR BOYFRIEND,
MY BEST PAL

05:23.757 --> 05:28.662
WILL BE THERE WITH ME,
OFFERING HIS LOVE AND SUPPORT.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.975
- [clears throat]

05:42.009 --> 05:44.578
WELL, WE'D BETTER
GET A MOVE ON,

05:44.612 --> 05:45.879
OR ELSE THESE FAIRIES
WON'T GET THEIR WINGS.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.115
- [squeals]

05:48.148 --> 05:49.617
[pats on the back]

05:50.884 --> 05:53.754
- BYE, HONEY.
- BYE.

05:53.787 --> 05:58.526
- BYE, HONEY.
[laughs]

05:59.793 --> 06:02.630
[laughter]

06:02.663 --> 06:05.666
- SO IT WAS ACTUALLY
A GOOD THING

06:05.699 --> 06:08.001
I LEFT HERE THAT NIGHT.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.903
SEE, MY--MY CONDO
NEEDED DUSTING.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.539
I DON'T REALLY TRUST
MY CLEANING LADY,

06:11.572 --> 06:16.076
AND, UH, IT GAVE ME TIME
TO THINK...

06:16.109 --> 06:19.513
ABOUT WHERE I SHOULD BE
AND WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING.

06:19.547 --> 06:23.183
SO I CAME BACK.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.419
ALTHOUGH
IT HASN'T BEEN EASY,

06:25.453 --> 06:27.020
AND EVERY DAY'S
BEEN A CHALLENGE.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.889
- BUT YOU DID IT.

06:28.922 --> 06:32.960
- YEAH, AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO LEAVE...

06:32.993 --> 06:36.897
WITH CLEAR EYES
AND MY HEAD HELD HIGH.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.832
[sighs]

06:38.866 --> 06:42.503
GUESS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU HAVE A GREAT COUNSELOR.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.037
AND YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE
RUNS OUT.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.039
[laughter]

06:46.073 --> 06:48.108
- YOU'LL BE BACK.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.177
- WHAT DID YOU SAY,
JONATHAN?

06:50.210 --> 06:52.913
- I SAID HE'LL BE BACK.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.683
- WELL, SURE, FOR GROUP,
AS AN OUTPATIENT.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.586
- I MEAN BACK USING,
AND THEN BACK HERE.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.654
- JESUS, JONATHAN,
CAN'T YOU BE POSITIVE?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.990
- [chuckles]
WELL, I'M THAT TOO.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.792
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO LAUGH
AT BILLY CRYSTAL HERE

07:04.825 --> 07:06.660
DOING HIS STAND-UP.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.828
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
ANY DIFFERENT FOR YOU

07:07.861 --> 07:08.962
THAN IT IS
FOR THE REST OF US.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.531
- YOU'RE WRONG.

07:10.564 --> 07:13.133
- AH, YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.869
IT'S NOT THE SAME WORLD YOU LEFT
WHEN YOU CAME HERE.

07:15.903 --> 07:19.573
- I'M GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT.

07:19.607 --> 07:23.577
- WELL, JUST IN CASE,
WE'LL LEAVE A LIGHT ON FOR YOU.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.482
- IT'S AN INTERESTING OFFER.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.617
- IT'S A FIRST-RATE COMPANY,
MR. KINNEY.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.818
YOU'D FIT RIGHT IN.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.720
- INTERESTING
IN THAT THEY THINK

07:32.753 --> 07:34.021
I'D ACTUALLY AGREE TO IT.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.824
2/3 OF WHAT I WAS
PREVIOUSLY MAKING,

07:36.857 --> 07:39.092
A LESSER TITLE,
AND NO PROFIT SHARING

07:39.126 --> 07:40.694
UNTIL THE FIFTH YEAR?
MMM.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.262
- TIMES ARE TOUGH, MR. KINNEY.
IT'S A JOB.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.232
- UH, YOU MEAN
INDENTURED SERVITUDE.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.100
- THEN YOU'RE PASSING?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.737
- YOU CAN TELL THEM
I'VE JUST TAKEN A NEW POSITION.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.104
BYE-BYE.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.906
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST DID THAT.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.275
- FLIPPED YOU ON YOUR BACK?
- FLIPPED OFF THAT HEADHUNTER.

07:55.308 --> 07:59.613
- I CAN DO BETTER.
- DOING WHAT?

07:59.647 --> 08:01.782
- WORKING FOR MYSELF
INSTEAD OF OTHER PEOPLE.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.584
- BUT ALL YOUR CLIENTS
TURNED YOU DOWN.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.252
- FUCK 'EM.
I'LL GET OTHERS.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.588
- WHAT IF YOU CAN'T?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.757
YOU'LL BE DESTITUTE.
YOU'LL HAVE NOTHING.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.125
- SINCE WHEN DID YOU
TURN INTO A JEWISH MOTHER?

08:12.159 --> 08:13.927
OR MICHAEL?

08:13.961 --> 08:16.730
- YOU'RE JUST TAKING
AN AWFULLY BIG RISK, THAT'S ALL.

08:16.764 --> 08:21.669
- WELL,
WHAT'S ONE MORE?

08:21.702 --> 08:26.874
BESIDES, IF I DON'T DO THIS NOW,
I NEVER WILL.

08:26.907 --> 08:31.144
[indistinct chatter]

08:31.178 --> 08:34.181
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
WE'RE NOT IN PITTSBURGH ANYMORE.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.918
- SOMETHING TELLS ME WE'RE
NOT EVEN ON THE PLANET ANYMORE.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.691
- YOU TWO MUST BE VIRGINS.

08:43.724 --> 08:47.094
- OKAY, HAVEN'T BEEN A VIRGIN
SINCE I WAS 15.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.696
- WELL, MAYBE OUT THERE,
BUT HERE,

08:48.729 --> 08:52.332
YOUR LIFE AS A FAIRY
HAS JUST BEGUN.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.901
I'M PERIWINKLE,

08:53.934 --> 08:56.837
THE QUEEN REGISTRAR
AND OFFICIAL GREET-AR.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.772
- "PERIWINKLE"?

08:58.806 --> 09:01.108
- IT'S MY FAIRY NAME.
EVERYONE HERE HAS ONE.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.176
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH OUR REAL NAMES?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.646
- REAL NAMES ARE FINE
FOR THE REAL WORLD,

09:05.679 --> 09:07.915
BUT THIS IS A SPECIAL PLACE.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.183
THIS IS A MAGICAL PLACE

09:10.217 --> 09:12.686
WHERE YOU LEAVE
YOUR REAL LIFE BEHIND...

09:12.720 --> 09:15.055
[chimes ringing]

09:15.088 --> 09:16.657
AT LEAST
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

09:16.690 --> 09:20.093
SO TAKE YOUR TIME,
GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.962
IT'LL BE YOUR FAIRY NAME
FOREVER.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.196
- OOH.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.065
- SO GET SETTLED
INTO YOUR CABIN.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.801
DINNER'S WHENEVER SPIRAL AND ELK
QUIT BRAIDING HAIR

09:27.835 --> 09:29.603
AND START BOILING
GARBANZOS.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.673
OH.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.342
THERE'S A MIDNIGHT MASSAGE
IN THE YURT.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.646
YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THAT.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.949
- WHAT'S A YURT?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.684
- IF WE BACK UP REAL SLOW,

09:43.717 --> 09:45.118
NO ONE WILL EVEN KNOW
WE WERE HERE.

09:45.152 --> 09:49.957
- HEY, YOU DRAGGED ME HERE.
WE'RE STAYING.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.959
BESIDES, WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.827
- THAT.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.696
- I'M LOOKING SO FORWARD TO THAT
TANTRIC SEX SEMINAR TODAY.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.698
- OH, ME TOO.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.700
- COULD YOU PASS ME
THE SHOVEL PLEASE?

09:59.733 --> 10:01.234
- WE'LL START
WITH A NEW LOGO,

10:01.268 --> 10:04.705
THEN LAUNCH AN AGGRESSIVE
AD CAMPAIGN IN THE LOCALS,

10:04.738 --> 10:06.907
AND SET UP SOME
HIGH-PROFILE SPONSORSHIPS.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.242
- THAT SOUNDS BIGGER
THAN WE CAN HANDLE.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.745
- IT'S SIMPLE BRANDING.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.714
- OUR CUSTOMERS
AREN'T INTO BRANDING.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.983
TATTOOS, PIERCINGS MAYBE.
- [laughs]

10:16.016 --> 10:18.151
I'M TALKING
ABOUT A NEW IMAGE.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.720
- I ADORE MAKEOVERS,

10:19.753 --> 10:25.158
BUT OUR AD BUDGET'S
ONLY $200 A MONTH.

10:25.192 --> 10:29.897
- GREAT, THEN WE'LL RUN
A LEAN CAMPAIGN.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.732
NO FAT.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.702
- JUST LIKE OUR CUSTOMERS.
PERFECT.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.207
- JUST BETWEEN US,
AROUND HERE,

10:40.240 --> 10:42.142
WE REFER TO JONATHAN
AS "D" AND "G."

10:42.175 --> 10:44.044
- DOLCE AND GABBANA?
- [laughs]

10:44.077 --> 10:46.046
NO, DOOM AND GLOOM.
- [chuckles]

10:46.079 --> 10:48.782
OH, HE DOESN'T BOTHER ME.
- THAT'S GOOD.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.450
TO BE HONEST,
HE'S NOT ENTIRELY WRONG.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.186
A LOT OF PATIENTS DO WIND UP
COMING BACK HERE.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.788
- NOT ME.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.957
- WELL, JUST REMEMBER
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.793
- YEAH, GIVE MYSELF TIME
TO ADJUST.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.930
- AND NOT JUST YOU,
BUT THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE

11:02.963 --> 11:05.933
ARE GOING TO NEED
SOME TIME TOO.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.840
HERE WE ARE.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.443
- [chuckles]

11:16.476 --> 11:18.946
NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE SO SCARED
TO SEE A DOOR.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.849
- DON'T THINK OF IT
AS A DOOR.

11:21.882 --> 11:25.919
THINK OF IT AS A THRESHOLD...

11:25.953 --> 11:28.221
TO A NEW LIFE.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.190
- RIGHT.

11:30.223 --> 11:34.862
LOOK, I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR...EVERYTHING.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.931
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO THANK ME.
YOU DID IT ALL.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.968
- WITH YOUR HELP.

11:43.871 --> 11:48.475
- LISTEN,
I-I WAS WONDERING IF I--

11:48.508 --> 11:50.343
WELL...

11:50.377 --> 11:53.280
I COULD GIVE YOU
A CALL SOMETIME--

11:53.313 --> 11:55.282
I MEAN, STRICTLY
ON A PROFESSIONAL BASIS.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.117
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
I SUDDENLY FIND MYSELF

11:57.150 --> 11:59.887
STANDING ON A LEDGE WITH A ROPE
AROUND MY NECK, OR SOMETHING.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.323
- OR MAYBE
JUST TO SAY HELLO?

12:07.127 --> 12:12.032
- * IT'S NOT AN EASY THING

12:12.065 --> 12:17.037
* TO FIND YOU CAN'T GO ON

12:17.070 --> 12:18.505
- [sighs]

12:18.538 --> 12:23.043
- * POINT OF RECKONING,
TO NOT BE STRONG *

12:23.076 --> 12:27.314
*

12:27.347 --> 12:32.385
* WHEN YOU CAN BARELY STAND

12:32.419 --> 12:37.190
* IT'S HARD TO TAKE A HAND

12:37.224 --> 12:42.262
* IT NEVER GOES AS PLANNED,
BUT ALL ALONG *

12:42.295 --> 12:45.398
- GOOD LUCK.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.268
- * I GUESS YOU KNEW THAT

12:48.301 --> 12:50.904
*

12:50.938 --> 12:53.273
* I GUESS YOU KNEW THAT

12:53.306 --> 12:55.275
*

12:55.308 --> 13:00.347
* I GUESS YOU KNEW THAT

13:00.380 --> 13:04.084
* ABOUT ME

13:04.117 --> 13:07.054
*

13:07.087 --> 13:10.157
- RECOGNIZE THIS?

13:10.190 --> 13:13.026
- OH, YES.
REMSON PHARMACEUTICAL ACCOUNT.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.094
MY LAST CAMPAIGN.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.562
- BEFORE THE OLD WARRIOR

13:15.595 --> 13:18.598
WAS UNCEREMONIOUSLY ESCORTED
FROM THE BUILDING

13:18.631 --> 13:21.368
WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A...
both: BALLPOINT PEN.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.904
- SO WHAT DOES
THIS MAGIC PILL DO?

13:23.937 --> 13:26.206
- WELL, IT'S GUARANTEED
TO TURN YOU INTO A HOTTIE

13:26.239 --> 13:27.507
WHO CAN CLIMB THE MATTERHORN.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.509
IT ALSO REDUCES
YOUR VIRAL LOAD.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.945
WHAT ARE YOU
SHOWING IT TO ME FOR?

13:31.979 --> 13:34.114
- VANCE IS TAKING YOUR IDEA

13:34.147 --> 13:36.216
AND PITCHING IT
TO REMSON TOMORROW.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.451
- WELL, HE SHOULD.
HE OWNS IT.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.954
- BUT YOU THOUGHT IT UP.

13:40.988 --> 13:44.191
- BASIC RULE OF ADVERTISING
AND ETERNAL DAMNATION:

13:44.224 --> 13:47.060
ONCE YOU SELL YOUR SOUL
TO THE DEVIL,

13:47.094 --> 13:48.628
HE HOLDS THE COPYRIGHT.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.597
- SO COME UP
WITH ANOTHER IDEA.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.066
- AND THEN YOU CAN STEAL
THE ACCOUNT FROM VANCE,

13:53.100 --> 13:54.935
AND YOUR FORMER ASSISTANT
ALONG WITH IT.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.203
- WELL, THAT'S
AN INGENIOUS PLAN, CYNTHIA.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.938
- [giggles]

13:57.971 --> 13:59.606
- BUT WHAT PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANY IS GOING TO TRUST

13:59.639 --> 14:01.608
THEIR WONDER WEAPON
TO A ONE-MAN BAND

14:01.641 --> 14:03.110
WORKING OUT OF HIS HOUSE?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.277
- IT'S NOT THE SIZE
THAT MATTERS.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.478
- HAVE I TAUGHT YOU
NOTHING?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.347
- IT'S THE VISION.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.883
IF YOU CAN WIN THIS ACCOUNT,
THEN YOU'LL BE BACK ON TOP.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.952
- [laughs]

14:11.985 --> 14:17.290
FOR ONCE,
I'LL STICK TO THE BOTTOM.

14:17.324 --> 14:20.127
- YOU HAVE TO THROW OFF
YOUR CIVILIAN DRAG

14:20.160 --> 14:24.564
AND BECOME TRUE FAIRIES,
OR ELSE THE MAGIC DOESN'T WORK.

14:24.597 --> 14:27.400
YOU'D LOOK ENCHANTING
IN THIS.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.169
- STRAPLESS MAKES ME
LOOK FAT.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.104
- WELL, THEN USE
YOUR OWN DIVINE POWERS

14:31.138 --> 14:33.106
AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING
FABULOUS.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.008
- FROM THESE SCHMATTAS?

14:35.042 --> 14:36.643
- EVERY FAIRY
HAS A GOD-GIVEN GIFT

14:36.676 --> 14:39.980
TO TAKE WHAT'S UGLY AND MAKE IT
INTO SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.548
[chimes ring]

14:41.581 --> 14:44.251
YOU'LL SOON DISCOVER
THAT YOU CAN DO THAT TOO.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.420
NOW, I REALLY MUST FLY.
I'M LATE FOR AN EAR-CANDLING.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.456
IF YOU CARE TO JOIN ME,
IT'S DOWN BY THE BOG.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.024
- WHERE'S THE BOG?

14:51.058 --> 14:54.027
- MAKE A LEFT AT THE YURT.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.664
- WHEN I AGREED
TO COME HERE WITH YOU,

14:57.697 --> 15:00.533
I DIDN'T AGREE
TO LOOK LIKE MY MOTHER.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.003
- WELL, MAYBE
PERIWINKLE'S RIGHT.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.672
IF WE PUT SOMETHING ON,
WE'LL...

15:05.705 --> 15:07.941
FEEL THE MAGIC.

15:07.975 --> 15:13.013
I LOOK LIKE VIRGINIA MAYO
IN SOUTH SEA WOMAN.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.615
YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST FORFEIT
OUR REGISTRATION FEE

15:15.648 --> 15:17.050
AND GO HOME.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.286
- NOW YOU TELL ME?

15:19.319 --> 15:21.154
I LOOK COMPLETELY
AND UTTERLY--

15:21.188 --> 15:22.489
- HOT!

15:22.522 --> 15:27.060
TOTALLY HOT.

15:27.094 --> 15:31.298
- IT'S JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
I PICKED OFF THE RACK.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.433
- I'M PISTON.
- I'M WOLFEN.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.169
- I'M...

15:36.203 --> 15:38.338
DUMPLING.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.574
- HELLO, DUMPLING.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.510
- SEE YA LATER, DUMPLING.

15:43.543 --> 15:47.314
- "DUMPLING"?
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

15:47.347 --> 15:49.749
- IT SUDDENLY CAME TO ME.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.185
- YOO-HOO!
WANNA PLAY?

15:52.219 --> 15:55.122
- COME ON.
- COME AND PLAY, COME ON.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.190
- THAT MUST BE
THE NAKED VOLLEYBALL GAME.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.592
- YOUR POWERS OF OBSERVATION
ARE REMARKABLE.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.194
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

16:01.228 --> 16:07.100
[laughter and chatter]

16:08.635 --> 16:10.403
- LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.772
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.
- WELL--EH, COME ON.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.607
IT MIGHT BE FUN.

16:14.641 --> 16:19.346
- YOU GO AHEAD, I'LL STAY HERE
AND SHAKE MY POM-POMS.

16:19.379 --> 16:24.751
[chatter]

16:24.784 --> 16:27.020
- AND WE'RE THANKFUL THAT YOU
CAME OUT TO SEE US TONIGHT.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.222
NOW, AS YOU KNOW,
THE POLICE ARE STILL WORKING

16:29.256 --> 16:32.125
TO APPREHEND THE THREE MEN
WHO ATTACKED DARREN EALY.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.494
- IN THE MEANTIME, WE'VE MET
WITH A LIAISON OFFICER

16:34.527 --> 16:36.363
WHO'S ASKED US
TO KEEP A LOOKOUT

16:36.396 --> 16:38.365
FOR ANYONE MATCHING
THEIR DESCRIPTIONS,

16:38.398 --> 16:40.100
AND TO TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS

16:40.133 --> 16:42.435
WHEN WE'RE OUT ON THE STREET,
ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.404
- KEEPING THAT IN MIND,
WE'D LIKE TO OPEN THE FLOOR

16:44.437 --> 16:47.140
TO YOUR SUGGESTIONS
ON HOW TO MAKE LIBERTY AVENUE

16:47.174 --> 16:49.809
A SAFER ENVIRONMENT
FOR ALL OF US.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.778
YES?

16:51.811 --> 16:54.114
- I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS,

16:54.147 --> 16:57.250
BUT THE FIRST THING WE NEED
IS MORE COPS ON THE STREET.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.052
- WE'VE ALREADY TALKED
TO THE NEW POLICE CHIEF.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.587
HE SAID HE'D DO HIS BEST.
- YEAH, SURE.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.422
WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT ONE
BEFORE.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.424
- THEN LET'S SEND A PETITION
TO THE MAYOR,

17:04.457 --> 17:05.792
DEMANDING
SOMETHING BE DONE.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.194
- WE ALSO NEED
SOME MORE LIGHTING,

17:07.227 --> 17:08.561
ESPECIALLY
ON THE SIDE STREETS.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.730
- GOOD IDEA.
WE'LL TAKE NOTE OF THAT.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.299
YES?

17:12.332 --> 17:13.333
- I THINK WE SHOULD
WEAR LITTLE WHISTLES

17:13.366 --> 17:14.534
AROUND OUR NECKS.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.602
THAT WAY,
IF SOMEONE ATTACKS US,

17:15.635 --> 17:17.470
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS BLOW.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.606
- [whistles]

17:19.639 --> 17:21.808
[crowd murmurs]

17:21.841 --> 17:25.145
LIKE THAT?

17:25.178 --> 17:27.547
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SAY SOMETHING?

17:27.580 --> 17:29.816
- WELL, WHO DO YOU THINK
WILL COME RUNNING?

17:29.849 --> 17:31.551
THEM?
[scoffs]

17:31.584 --> 17:33.553
THEY CAN'T EVEN
DEFEND THEMSELVES.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.588
THE COPS?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.690
IF A BUNCH OF HOMO-HATERS WANT
TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF YOU,

17:37.724 --> 17:39.826
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP THEM
BY BLOWING A LITTLE WHISTLE.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.162
- THEN WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

17:42.195 --> 17:45.165
- WE PROTECT OURSELVES.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.433
PATROL THE STREETS.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.335
- YOU MEAN
A VIGILANTE GROUP?

17:48.368 --> 17:50.303
- YEAH, THE PINK POSSE.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.705
- ISN'T THAT TAKING THE LAW
INTO YOUR OWN HANDS?

17:52.739 --> 17:55.208
- WHICH LAW IS THAT?

17:55.242 --> 17:57.177
THE ONE THAT SAYS
YOU CAN'T GET MARRIED?

17:57.210 --> 17:59.312
THAT IF THEY FIND OUT
YOU'RE GAY,

17:59.346 --> 18:00.780
THEY CAN FIRE YOUR ASS?

18:00.813 --> 18:02.715
THAT YOU CAN'T ADOPT KIDS?

18:02.749 --> 18:05.852
HELL, THEY CAN EVEN
ARREST YOU FOR FUCKING.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.720
- THAT WAS CHANGED.
- RIGHT.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.722
YOU CAN NOW COPULATE
IN TEXAS.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.859
WELL, YIPPIE-KI-YO-KI-AY!

18:12.892 --> 18:14.661
[crowd laughing and murmuring]

18:14.694 --> 18:16.463
- SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.265
OKAY,
LET'S HAVE SOME ORDER.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.468
- YOU THINK ANYONE WOULD DARE
CALL A BLACK MAN A NIGGER?

18:21.501 --> 18:24.371
AND TRY CALLING AN ISRAELI
A KIKE.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.507
MAN, THEY'D BLOW YOUR ASS
RIGHT OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.741
[scattered chatter]

18:28.775 --> 18:31.511
BUT THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM
CALLING US FAGS.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.880
WHY?

18:33.913 --> 18:35.615
BECAUSE THEY CAN.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.217
[crowd murmuring]

18:37.250 --> 18:38.785
BECAUSE THEY KNOW
WE'RE ALL SISSIES,

18:38.818 --> 18:42.889
THAT WE'RE TOO CHICKENSHIT
TO DO ANYTHING.

18:42.922 --> 18:47.627
SO GO ON, SIGN YOUR PETITIONS
AND WRITE YOUR LETTERS

18:47.660 --> 18:49.762
AND BLOW
YOUR LITTLE WHISTLES,

18:49.796 --> 18:54.267
BUT NOTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE
UNTIL YOU FIGHT BACK.

18:54.301 --> 18:58.238
UNTIL YOU LEARN TO SAY,
"DON'T FUCK WITH ME!"

18:58.271 --> 19:04.211
[crowd murmuring]

19:11.618 --> 19:13.553
- HEY, DID YOU SEE THIS?

19:13.586 --> 19:15.522
THEY ACTUALLY CAUGHT
THE FUCKING BASHERS.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.290
- MMM.
WOW, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.458
- WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL
IF, FOR ONCE,

19:18.491 --> 19:19.926
JUSTICE WERE ACTUALLY SERVED?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.294
- YEAH, WELL, I'D LOVE
TO SERVE IT TO THEM,

19:21.328 --> 19:22.929
RIGHT DOWN
THEIR FUCKING THROATS.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.797
- IT'S ALL THANKS
TO DARREN'S DESCRIPTION.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.266
- I BET HE MUST
FEEL RELIEVED.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.800
- MORE LIKE BLOODTHIRSTY.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.336
- WELL, WE ALL KNOW
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TERRIFYING

19:29.369 --> 19:30.570
THAN A BLOODTHIRSTY
DRAG QUEEN.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.339
[laughs]

19:32.372 --> 19:34.407
- HEY, DEB,
HOW ABOUT A CUP OF COFFEE?

19:34.441 --> 19:36.743
- SURE, HONEY,
HAVE A SEAT, I'LL BE--

19:36.776 --> 19:38.545
TEDDY.
HI, HONEY!

19:38.578 --> 19:40.213
all: TED!

19:40.247 --> 19:41.314
- WE MISSED YOU!

19:41.348 --> 19:43.216
- OH, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

19:43.250 --> 19:44.217
- I'M DOING GREAT.

19:44.251 --> 19:47.287
- AH, YOU LOOK GOOD.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.622
- WELL, SO WHAT'S NEW?

19:49.656 --> 19:52.825
- I JUST GOT OUT OF REHAB.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.995
- HOW DID IT GO?

19:56.028 --> 19:58.431
- IT WAS PROBABLY
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE

19:58.465 --> 19:59.732
OF MY LIFE.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.301
YEAH, THE FIRST DAY
I WAS THERE,

20:01.334 --> 20:04.337
I WAS TOTALLY RESISTANT,
FURIOUS, ASHAMED,

20:04.371 --> 20:06.005
CERTAIN I DIDN'T
BELONG THERE.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.641
THE SECOND DAY,
I STARTED TO ACCEPT THEIR HELP,

20:08.675 --> 20:12.312
WENT TO GROUP
AND INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.980
I BEGAN SHARING THE PAIN,
YOU KNOW.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.482
[bell dings]
- HEY, DEB!

20:15.515 --> 20:16.716
- THE THIRD DAY,
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE I--

20:16.749 --> 20:18.585
- HONEY, SORRY,
I'D LOVE TO STAY

20:18.618 --> 20:20.019
FOR THE WHOLE SEVEN DAYS,
BUT I'VE GOT A GRILLED CHEESE

20:20.052 --> 20:21.521
THAT'S ABOUT TO TURN TO CEMENT.
[laughs]

20:21.554 --> 20:23.523
- OH, OKAY.
- WELCOME HOME.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.991
- I'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE GALLERY.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.859
- OKAY, BYE.
- I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE,

20:26.893 --> 20:27.927
BUT GUS IS WAITING
AT DAYCARE.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.897
- OKAY.
BYE.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.869
DON'T YOU HAVE
SOMEWHERE TO BE?

20:36.903 --> 20:40.640
- THANKS FOR REMINDING ME.
WELCOME BACK.

20:43.510 --> 20:47.246
- WELL I, FOR ONE, THINK YOU'RE
TO BE COMMENDED, THEODORE.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.883
- WELL, THANK YOU, BRIAN.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.019
- WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED
IS AN AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.654
- OH, I WOULDN'T GO
SO FAR AS--

20:54.687 --> 20:57.657
- TO SINK SO LOW.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.893
TO HIT BOTTOM
WITH SUCH A RESOUNDING THUD.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.662
- YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD BE
A GUEST MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER

21:02.695 --> 21:03.696
IN REHAB.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.764
- OF COURSE, THE GOOD NEWS IS,

21:04.797 --> 21:06.065
ONCE YOU'VE HIT THE BOTTOM,

21:06.098 --> 21:07.900
YOU CAN'T GO ANY LOWER,
SO THAT MEANS

21:07.934 --> 21:11.338
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GO,
AND THAT WAY IS...

21:13.840 --> 21:16.543
SOUNDS LIKE...

21:16.576 --> 21:18.978
- UP?
- [sips coffee]

21:32.459 --> 21:34.527
- WE CAN DO A CROSS-POLLINATION
CAMPAIGN WITH TORSO.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.995
- [grunts]
- A NEW MEMBERSHIP HERE

21:36.028 --> 21:37.697
GETS YOU 10% OFF THERE.

21:37.730 --> 21:41.734
200 BUCKS OF CLUB WEAR THERE
GETS YOU 10% OFF HERE.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.537
- SOUNDS LIKE
AN INTERESTING IDEA.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.639
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

21:47.707 --> 21:50.076
- HELLO.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.745
- IT'S BATMAN
AND THE NEW ROBIN.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.747
- BETTER NOT TELL
THE OLD ROBIN THAT.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.949
JUST GOT HUNTER
A MEMBERSHIP.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.951
- YEAH, YOU WANT TO HOOK UP
IN THE STEAM ROOM?

21:58.985 --> 22:01.888
- YEAH, HE SHOULD FIT IN
HERE JUST FINE.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.823
- WE DID NOT COME HERE
SO YOU COULD HIT ON THE GUYS.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.091
THAT INCLUDES BRIAN.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.359
WE CAME SO YOU
COULD STAY HEALTHY.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.960
- TOO LATE FOR THAT.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.430
- NO, IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
TO GET IN SHAPE.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.600
- YEAH, YOU WANT TO DEVELOP THAT
SIX-PACK BEFORE YOU DRINK IT.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.435
I COULD USE THAT
FOR THE AD.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.570
- WHY WORK OUT WHEN I CAN
TAKE SOME MEDS AND KA-POW!

22:17.604 --> 22:19.606
SO LONG, VIRUS.
- BECAUSE IT'S BETTER

22:19.639 --> 22:21.774
TO BUILD YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
NATURALLY.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.610
- GUY LOOKS PRETTY HEALTHY
TO ME.

22:23.643 --> 22:24.877
- THAT'S NOT WHAT HIV
LOOKS LIKE,

22:24.911 --> 22:26.513
AND THE MEDS
DON'T FIX ANYTHING.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.847
THEY BUY YOU TIME
IF THEY WORK,

22:27.880 --> 22:29.382
AND THEN THERE ARE
DOZENS OF SIDE-EFFECTS:

22:29.416 --> 22:32.585
SKIN RASHES, LIVER FAILURE,
CARDIAC ARREST.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.488
- A LITTLE EARLY TO BE FREAKING
THE KID OUT, DON'T YOU THINK?

22:35.522 --> 22:36.989
- I JUST DON'T WANT HIM
BELIEVING SOME MISLEADING AD

22:37.023 --> 22:38.525
THAT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

22:38.558 --> 22:41.027
IS POP SOME PILL
AND YOU'RE AS GOOD AS NEW.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.462
ANYBODY WHO'S EVER
TAKEN ONE KNOWS

22:42.495 --> 22:45.398
WHAT A CROCK OF SHIT
THAT IS.

22:59.679 --> 23:04.651
[laughter]

23:08.788 --> 23:13.392
[groaning and laughter]

23:21.534 --> 23:24.904
- MUSHROOM?

23:24.937 --> 23:28.441
- SURE, WHY NOT?

23:28.475 --> 23:32.912
- * YOU SET FOOT IN THE FOREST

23:32.945 --> 23:37.183
* BUT YOUR MIND'S SET
IN CONCRETE *

23:37.216 --> 23:41.688
* STILL YOU TRY
TO GET BACK TO NATURE *

23:41.721 --> 23:45.925
* BUT YOU'RE LONGING
FOR THE STREETS *

23:45.958 --> 23:51.197
* OF NEW YORK CITY,
OH, THE CITY *

23:51.230 --> 23:55.001
* TO MAKE YOU FEEL COMPLETE

23:55.034 --> 24:00.006
* LIKE A REFINED YOUNG MAN

24:00.039 --> 24:02.742
* IN THE JUNGLES

24:02.775 --> 24:04.977
*

24:05.011 --> 24:09.015
* YOU THINK
YOU WANT TO BE HERE *

24:09.048 --> 24:14.554
* IT LOOKED GOOD
IN THE MAGAZINE *

24:14.587 --> 24:18.758
* TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR PRIMAL SELF *

24:18.791 --> 24:22.962
* A GARDEN OF EDEN SCENE

24:22.995 --> 24:27.266
* LIKE A REFINED YOUNG MAN

24:27.299 --> 24:30.136
* IN THE JUNGLES

24:30.169 --> 24:32.872
*

24:32.905 --> 24:40.647
* OOH, AHH

24:40.680 --> 24:46.252
* OOH

24:46.285 --> 24:54.126
* OH, OH, OH

24:54.160 --> 25:02.134
* OOH

25:02.168 --> 25:05.638
- HEY, LOOKING FOR
THE NAKED TWISTER COMPETITION?

25:05.672 --> 25:08.608
- PROBABLY THE LAST THING
I'M LOOKING FOR.

25:08.641 --> 25:12.211
- THEN, UH, HOW ABOUT
GIVING ME A HAND, DARLING?

25:12.244 --> 25:14.280
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:14.313 --> 25:16.816
- IMPORTANT WORK.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.887
- MOVING ROCKS?

25:20.920 --> 25:23.690
- DEPENDS ON WHY
YOU'RE MOVING THEM.

25:23.723 --> 25:27.594
HERE, HELP ME
PLACE THEM IN A CIRCLE.

25:34.066 --> 25:37.169
YOU'RE A NEW FAIRY,
AREN'T YA?

25:37.203 --> 25:39.672
- AROUND HERE,
I SUPPOSE I AM.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.774
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

25:41.808 --> 25:43.109
- EMMETT.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.678
- NO, I DON'T MEAN
YOUR MUNDANE NAME.

25:45.712 --> 25:51.350
BACK THERE, I'M HARRY,
BUT HERE, I'M ARIEL.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.654
SO WHAT'S YOUR FAIRY NAME?

25:54.687 --> 25:56.222
- I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF ONE.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.825
- WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?

25:58.858 --> 26:00.326
- I DON'T KNOW.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.361
- I DO.
- [grunts]

26:02.394 --> 26:05.097
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN FAIRIES.

26:05.131 --> 26:08.334
YOU THINK THIS
IS ALL NONSENSE, DON'T YA?

26:08.367 --> 26:12.739
- NO!
I DON'T, REALLY.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.708
YEAH, I DO.
- [laughs]

26:15.742 --> 26:18.344
WELL, MAYBE WHEN YOU STOP
THINKING THAT WAY,

26:18.377 --> 26:20.112
YOUR FAIRY NAME
WILL COME TO YOU.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.682
- [grunts]

26:22.715 --> 26:27.720
- BUT SOMEHOW,
I DOUBT IT.

26:27.754 --> 26:31.223
YOU SEE, DARLING,
I CAN ALWAYS TELL.

26:31.257 --> 26:35.094
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF US,
A PROUD FAIRY.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.764
- I HAPPEN TO BE
A VERY PROUD FAIRY.

26:37.797 --> 26:42.835
ASK ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME.
MY FLAME BURNS BRIGHT.

26:42.869 --> 26:46.238
- WELL, RIGHT NOW,
IT COULDN'T TOAST A MARSHMALLOW.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.175
- [grunts]
IT MAY BE A LITTLE LOW.

26:49.208 --> 26:53.780
- BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HURT...
BY SOMEONE YOU LOVED.

26:53.813 --> 26:58.785
NOW ALL YOU CAN FEEL
IS ANGER AND PAIN.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.753
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

27:00.787 --> 27:04.323
- YOU WEAR IT, DARLING.
LIKE THAT OUTFIT...

27:04.356 --> 27:05.992
- [grunts]

27:06.025 --> 27:09.929
- WHICH, BY THE WAY,
ISN'T VERY FLATTERING.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.263
- THANKS.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.199
- HEY, GIVE ME THAT.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.872
- PRETTY STRONG FOR A--
- AN OLD FAIRY?

27:19.906 --> 27:21.407
IT'S CALLED FAIRY POWER.

27:21.440 --> 27:26.278
IT'S WHAT GIVES US
OUR WILL TO SURVIVE.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.916
BUT SOMETIMES,
WE FORGET WE HAVE IT.

27:32.218 --> 27:35.054
THAT'S WHY THE GATHERING
WAS STARTED,

27:35.087 --> 27:39.158
TO HELP US REMEMBER,
TO CELEBRATE.

27:39.191 --> 27:44.030
- THAT'S WHY I CAME,
TO RENEW MY SPIRIT, YOU KNOW?

27:44.063 --> 27:46.032
BUT IT ISN'T WORKING.

27:46.065 --> 27:51.303
- 'CAUSE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
ISN'T HERE.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.705
- THEN WHERE IS IT?

27:52.739 --> 27:58.210
- THERE,
THE CIRCLE IS COMPLETE.

28:10.089 --> 28:15.995
[keyboard clacks]

28:20.867 --> 28:23.202
[ding]

28:23.235 --> 28:25.137
- OHH!
- YOU WANT A SNORT?

28:25.171 --> 28:27.974
YOU WANT TO BE BEAUTIFUL?

28:28.007 --> 28:32.011
YOU WERE HOT.
HOT, HOT, DARLING.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.876
[knocking at the door]

29:10.149 --> 29:11.517
- HI.
- HEY.

29:11.550 --> 29:12.852
- CAN WE COME IN?

29:12.885 --> 29:15.554
- UH, YEAH.
YEAH, SURE.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.025
- LISTEN, WE DIDN'T MEAN TO RUN
OUT OF THE DINER LIKE THAT.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.326
- WE WERE JUST IN A HURRY.
- YEAH.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.261
- THAT'S OKAY.
I-I UNDERSTAND.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.396
- SO YOU ALL RIGHT?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.398
- YEAH, FINE, FINE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.900
- WE BROUGHT DROOPY BACK,

29:27.934 --> 29:29.001
THOUGH, YOU MIGHT
HAVE TO RENAME HIM.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.269
HE'S NOT DROOPING
ANYMORE.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.138
AND LOOK,
HE'S EVEN GOT A NEW BUD.

29:32.171 --> 29:35.341
- JUST NEEDED A LITTLE TLC.
- THAT'S "TENDER LESBIAN CARE."

29:35.374 --> 29:37.043
- AND YOUR MAIL.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.544
- WE ALSO BROUGHT YOU
A FEW THINGS YOU MIGHT NEED.

29:38.577 --> 29:43.249
- MILK, COFFEE, EGGS.

29:48.054 --> 29:50.056
- I WAS, UH...

29:50.089 --> 29:53.325
I WAS JUST GETTING RID
OF MY TRIGGERS.

29:53.359 --> 29:56.162
ANYTHING THAT
REMINDS YOU OF WHAT

29:56.195 --> 29:59.231
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE REMINDED OF.

29:59.265 --> 30:03.435
IN MY CASE--

30:03.469 --> 30:05.104
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I SHOULD

30:05.137 --> 30:09.976
MOVE TO A DESERT ISLAND
AND START FROM SCRATCH.

30:10.009 --> 30:14.013
ANYWAY, IT'S THE FIRST THING
THEY TELL YOU TO DO.

30:16.015 --> 30:19.051
LOOK, I-I-I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK I WAS--

30:19.085 --> 30:20.319
BECAUSE I WASN'T.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.487
- NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.
- OH, NO.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.490
NO ONE SAID YOU WERE.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.262
- CRUNCHY GRANOLA.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.064
WHAT, YOU GIRLS
TRYING TO CONVERT ME?

30:32.098 --> 30:33.933
- [chuckles]

30:33.966 --> 30:36.268
[speaking quietly to each other]

30:36.302 --> 30:38.270
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME OVER
FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

30:38.304 --> 30:40.072
- YOU CAN PICK UP
YOUR MAGAZINES.

30:40.106 --> 30:42.141
- YOU GOT A TON OF 'EM.

30:42.174 --> 30:45.411
- WHAT IS ENDOVIR?

30:45.444 --> 30:48.480
IS IT A DRUG?
A PILL?

30:48.514 --> 30:52.284
THE LATEST MIRACLE
OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY?

30:52.318 --> 30:55.888
OF COURSE, IT'S ALL
OF THESE THINGS, AND MORE.

30:55.922 --> 31:00.559
IT IS THE PROMISE OF HEALTH,
OF A FUTURE BRIGHT WITH HOPE,

31:00.592 --> 31:05.297
OF DREAMS FULFILLED,
OF BEING...

31:05.331 --> 31:07.133
"BACK ON TOP."

31:07.166 --> 31:09.101
AND SO WE'VE DESIGNED
A CAMPAIGN

31:09.135 --> 31:13.139
TO ACCENTUATE THE POSITIVE
ASPECTS OF BEING POSITIVE.

31:13.172 --> 31:17.509
A CAMPAIGN
BASED ON ONE SIMPLE WORD,

31:17.543 --> 31:19.311
AND THAT WORD IS--

31:19.345 --> 31:21.513
- BULLSHIT?

31:21.547 --> 31:24.183
- I WAS GONNA SAY
"OPTIMISM."

31:24.216 --> 31:28.054
- MELON BALL, ANYONE?
- [chuckles]

31:28.087 --> 31:30.122
HOW THE HELL DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS MEETING?

31:30.156 --> 31:33.559
- I'M THE ONE WHO SET IT UP,
BEFORE I LEFT.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.327
- AH.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.164
- I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
DOWNPLAYED THE DISEASE,

31:38.197 --> 31:40.132
EMPHASIZED QUALITY OF LIFE.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.401
- I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY
AS TO HAVE HIV,

31:42.434 --> 31:44.670
THEN I TOO COULD
GO PLAY VOLLEYBALL

31:44.703 --> 31:47.173
WITH MY SHIRTLESS,
HUNKY BUDS.

31:47.206 --> 31:49.141
- [laughs]

31:49.175 --> 31:50.409
IF YOU DON'T GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF HERE,

31:50.442 --> 31:53.145
I'M CALLING SECURITY.

31:53.179 --> 31:56.148
- REGRETFULLY, MR. REMSON,
I MUST BE GOING,

31:56.182 --> 31:59.685
BUT BEFORE I LEAVE, I'D LIKE,
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,

31:59.718 --> 32:02.221
TO SHOW YOU A NEW CAMPAIGN
I'VE DESIGNED

32:02.254 --> 32:05.457
BASED ON ONE SIMPLE WORD,

32:05.491 --> 32:09.161
AND THAT WORD
IS "HONESTY."

32:09.195 --> 32:12.698
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

32:12.731 --> 32:16.168
THE REAL FACE OF HIV.

32:16.202 --> 32:21.173
"SOME DAYS I FEEL LIKE HELL,
BUT AT LEAST I'M STILL ALIVE."

32:21.207 --> 32:23.742
"I DON'T WANT TO CLIMB
A MOUNTAIN,

32:23.775 --> 32:27.213
I JUST WANT TO LIVE
ANOTHER DAY."

32:27.246 --> 32:30.983
"SURE, THERE ARE SIDE EFFECTS,
BUT NOTHING I CAN'T HANDLE."

32:31.017 --> 32:32.318
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.086
- IT'S STRONG MEDICINE,
I'LL ADMIT THAT.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.454
- WE SPENT SIX YEARS

32:35.487 --> 32:37.656
AND 50 MILLION
DEVELOPING THIS DRUG.

32:37.689 --> 32:41.093
I PERSONALLY WORKED MY ASS OFF
GETTING IT THROUGH THE FDA.

32:41.127 --> 32:43.662
AND YOU THINK I'M GOING TO THROW
IT AWAY ON SOME AD CAMPAIGN

32:43.695 --> 32:45.497
THAT TELLS PEOPLE
THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL LIKE HELL?

32:45.531 --> 32:47.599
- THEY ALREADY KNOW THAT,

32:47.633 --> 32:49.368
AND THEY'RE WILLING
TO ACCEPT IT,

32:49.401 --> 32:53.772
PROVIDED YOUR DRUG CAN BUY THEM
ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER MONTH.

32:53.805 --> 32:58.344
THAT'S ALL THEY'RE HOPING FOR.
THAT'S ALL THEY WANT.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.346
AND THAT'S ALL
YOU CAN HONESTLY OFFER.

33:00.379 --> 33:03.649
- OUR JOB
IS TO MAKE YOUR PRODUCT

33:03.682 --> 33:06.785
AS ATTRACTIVE AS POSSIBLE
TO THE CONSUMER,

33:06.818 --> 33:08.420
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE DID.

33:08.454 --> 33:12.291
- UH, YOU MEAN, WHAT I DID.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.161
THIS...WAS MY IDEA,

33:15.194 --> 33:18.530
AND LET ME BE THE FIRST
TO SAY IT STINKS.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.170
HAVING HIV MAY NOT BE
A RIDE IN THE PARK,

33:24.203 --> 33:28.374
BUT WITH ENDOVIR,
IT'S NOT A DEATH SENTENCE.

33:28.407 --> 33:32.344
SO WHY NOT JUST SAY THAT?

33:35.214 --> 33:37.649
- "SUSPECTS MATCHING
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE THREE MEN

33:37.683 --> 33:41.120
"WHO ATTACKED A YOUNG, GAY MAN
WERE APPREHENDED LAST NIGHT

33:41.153 --> 33:43.255
"IN THE VICINITY
OF LIBERTY AVENUE.

33:43.289 --> 33:46.558
CHARGES WILL BE FILED
PENDING AN INVESTIGATION."

33:46.592 --> 33:48.160
UH, ISN'T THAT GREAT?

33:48.194 --> 33:50.196
THEY FINALLY CAUGHT
THE MOTHERFUCKERS.

33:50.229 --> 33:53.132
NOW, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS FINGER THEM,

33:53.165 --> 33:54.700
METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING,
OF COURSE,

33:54.733 --> 33:58.670
AND THEY CAN ROT BEHIND BARS
FOR 20 YEARS.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.606
OR BETTER YET,
GET GANG-RAPED NIGHTLY

34:00.639 --> 34:02.274
BY PRISONERS WITH AIDS.

34:02.308 --> 34:04.843
- I'M THINKING MAYBE
SHANDA SHOULD GO BLONDE

34:04.876 --> 34:07.213
FOR HER COMEBACK.

34:09.515 --> 34:12.484
- DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?
- OF COURSE I HEARD YOU.

34:12.518 --> 34:15.487
"GANG-RAPED NIGHTLY
BY PRISONERS WITH AIDS."

34:15.521 --> 34:18.290
WHERE DO YOU COME UP
WITH SUCH GRUESOME THOUGHTS?

34:18.324 --> 34:19.558
[grunts]

34:19.591 --> 34:23.495
- SO WHEN'S THE LINE-UP?

34:23.529 --> 34:25.697
- IF YOU'RE REFERRING
TO WHAT GOES ON IN THE BACK ROOM

34:25.731 --> 34:27.866
OF A CERTAIN CLUB,

34:27.899 --> 34:31.370
I DON'T ENGAGE
IN SUCH ACTIVITY.

34:31.403 --> 34:34.306
- I'M REFERRING
TO THE POLICE LINE-UP.

34:34.340 --> 34:37.276
WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO IDENTIFY THEM?

34:41.280 --> 34:44.383
- I'M NOT.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.318
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A VERY CLEAR MEMORY

34:46.352 --> 34:47.719
OF WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE.

34:47.753 --> 34:48.887
- BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO DESCRIBED THEM.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.589
- GUESS I'VE FORGOTTEN.

34:50.622 --> 34:52.324
- WELL, MAYBE SEEING THEM AGAIN
WILL JOG YOUR MEMORY.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.792
- LOOK, I ALREADY
TOLD THE POLICE,

34:53.825 --> 34:55.394
"SORRY, WISH I COULD HELP,
BUT I REALLY CAN'T.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.396
THANKS FOR ASKING."

34:57.429 --> 34:59.198
- IF YOU DON'T POINT THEM OUT,
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO WALK.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.267
- I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO DISCUSS THIS ANY FURTHER!

35:01.300 --> 35:02.668
NOW, WHAT'S FOR LUNCH?

35:02.701 --> 35:05.737
- CHICKEN.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.274
- [scoffs]

35:08.307 --> 35:12.911
- DARREN, WHY DID YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

35:12.944 --> 35:15.414
- I-I GUESS I HAD TIME
TO THINK,

35:15.447 --> 35:20.486
AND I DECIDED COWARDICE
IS THE BETTER PART OF VALOR.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.488
- [sighs]
NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

35:22.521 --> 35:26.358
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
SAY I IDENTIFY THEM.

35:26.392 --> 35:31.430
SAY THEY GO TO TRIAL.
SAY THEY GET OFF.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.898
SAY THEY COME
LOOKING FOR ME.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.766
- SAY THEY'RE BACK
ON THE STREET TOMORROW

35:34.800 --> 35:36.502
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
- [scoffs]

35:36.535 --> 35:38.437
- SAY THEY ATTACK SOMEONE ELSE.
- LOOK, YOU'RE THE ONE

35:38.470 --> 35:40.506
WHO TOLD ME
TO PUT ALL THIS BEHIND ME,

35:40.539 --> 35:44.410
TO GET ON WITH MY LIFE,
HUH?

35:44.443 --> 35:48.280
YES,
I DO THINK BLONDE.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.316
- MAYBE I WAS WRONG.
- [scoffs]

35:50.349 --> 35:52.818
- MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT WE
STOOD UP FOR OURSELVES,

35:52.851 --> 35:54.253
FOUGHT BACK.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.854
- AND WHEN YOUR ATTACKER
BASHED YOU

35:55.887 --> 35:57.556
AND LEFT YOU FOR DEAD,

35:57.589 --> 35:59.325
AND THEN THEY GOT OFF
PRACTICALLY SCOT-FREE,

35:59.358 --> 36:02.394
WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU DO?

36:08.300 --> 36:09.868
- I KNOW I SAID
I'D ONLY CALL YOU

36:09.901 --> 36:11.537
IF I WAS ON A LEDGE
WITH A ROPE AROUND MY NECK,

36:11.570 --> 36:13.739
BUT I FIGURED A CURB AND A SCARF
WOULD SUFFICE.

36:13.772 --> 36:17.543
- IT'S NO PROBLEM, I TOLD YOU
YOU COULD CALL ME ANYTIME.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.944
MORE COFFEE?

36:18.977 --> 36:20.679
- [chuckles]
NO.

36:20.712 --> 36:24.550
IF I WAS ANY MORE WIRED,
I'D LIGHT UP TIMES SQUARE.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.352
- BE PATIENT.

36:26.385 --> 36:29.421
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN
BACK IN YOUR LIFE FOR ONE DAY.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.690
- AND ALREADY I'M A WRECK.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.226
AH, GOD.
I EVEN HAVE SWEATY PALMS.

36:34.260 --> 36:36.428
FUCK.

36:36.462 --> 36:39.631
ROD LONGBOTTOM WAS A GUY I DATED
ONCE FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

36:39.665 --> 36:42.368
LIVED UP TO BOTH HIS NAMES.
GORGEOUS, AMAZING.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.969
I DUMPED HIM.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

36:44.002 --> 36:45.837
SWEATY PALMS.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.307
- REMEMBER,
AS WE DISCUSSED IN GROUP,

36:48.340 --> 36:50.709
IT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO,
NOT JUST FOR YOU,

36:50.742 --> 36:53.312
BUT FOR EVERYONE
AROUND YOU.

36:53.345 --> 36:55.647
- I MAKE MY FRIENDS NERVOUS.

36:55.681 --> 36:58.517
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
THEY SEE ME, THEY WANT TO FLEE.

36:58.550 --> 37:02.621
THEY DON'T TRUST ME.
THEY THINK I'M STILL USING.

37:02.654 --> 37:05.391
- SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME.

37:05.424 --> 37:08.894
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY CAME AROUND
AND EVEN FORGAVE ME.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.730
EXCEPT ONE.

37:11.763 --> 37:15.534
- YOUR MOTHER?
YOUR FATHER?

37:15.567 --> 37:19.738
- FIRST GUY WHO EVER
BELIEVED IN ME.

37:19.771 --> 37:22.474
I NEVER REALLY
MADE AMENDS TO HIM.

37:22.508 --> 37:25.444
- DID YOU TRY?

37:27.546 --> 37:29.648
- WE LOST TOUCH.

37:29.681 --> 37:34.720
BUT RECENTLY,
WE'VE RECONNECTED.

37:42.394 --> 37:45.331
MAYBE NOW
I'LL GET MY CHANCE.

37:46.832 --> 37:49.801
[dance music]

37:49.835 --> 37:57.543
*

37:58.844 --> 38:02.381
- * COME NOW
AND BE WITH ME *

38:02.414 --> 38:06.652
* COME NOW
AND LOOK AND SEE *

38:06.685 --> 38:10.456
* COME NOW
AND LOOK AT WHERE I AM *

38:10.489 --> 38:14.560
* COME NOW
IF YOU GIVE A DAMN *

38:14.593 --> 38:18.096
* COME NOW
AND BE WITH ME *

38:18.129 --> 38:21.733
* COME NOW
AND LOOK AND SEE *

38:21.767 --> 38:25.604
* COME NOW
LOOK AT WHERE I AM *

38:25.637 --> 38:28.574
* COME NOW
IF YOU GIVE A DAMN *

38:28.607 --> 38:29.741
* COME ON

38:29.775 --> 38:32.411
*

38:32.444 --> 38:33.745
* COME ON

38:33.779 --> 38:36.014
*

38:36.047 --> 38:37.583
* COME ON

38:37.616 --> 38:39.618
*

38:39.651 --> 38:41.420
* COME ON

38:41.453 --> 38:43.855
- HMM, SINCE WHEN
DID OUR HEROES

38:43.889 --> 38:45.957
BECOME THE MERRY BUTCHERS
OF GAYOPOLIS?

38:45.991 --> 38:48.093
- SOMEONE HAS TO DO IT,
SINCE FAGS ARE TOO COWARDLY

38:48.126 --> 38:51.029
TO STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.701
FUCK!

38:55.734 --> 38:58.036
[grunts]
- SOMEBODY'S PISSED OFF.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.706
- YEAH, YOU WOULD BE TOO
IF YOU GOT YOUR HEAD BASHED IN.

39:00.739 --> 39:04.376
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I WAS THERE.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.448
I THOUGHT YOU'D PUT THAT
BEHIND YOU AND MOVED ON.

39:09.481 --> 39:12.384
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

39:19.425 --> 39:21.927
DARREN REFUSED
TO IDENTIFY HIS ATTACKERS.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.995
THEY'RE GOING TO GET OFF.

39:24.029 --> 39:27.466
WHEN I TOLD HIM TO BE BRAVE,
STAND UP FOR HIMSELF,

39:27.499 --> 39:30.469
HE SAID TO ME,
"WHAT DID YOU DO?"

39:30.502 --> 39:32.538
I WAS A COWARD.

39:32.571 --> 39:36.875
I SHOULD'VE DONE SOMETHING
AND I DIDN'T.

39:36.908 --> 39:41.813
- [sighs]
WELL, YOU WANT TO GET EVEN?

39:41.847 --> 39:44.049
I'LL TELL YOU
HOW TO GET EVEN.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.151
BECOME THE BIGGEST FUCKING
SUCCESS YOU CAN POSSIBLY BE.

39:46.184 --> 39:49.655
- I ALREADY KNOW.
- WELL, THEN, IF YOU KNOW,

39:49.688 --> 39:51.557
TAKE THAT ANGER
AND PUT IT INTO YOUR WORK.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.792
USE IT.

39:53.825 --> 39:58.830
HAVE MORE MONEY, MORE POWER,
AND MORE SEX

39:58.864 --> 40:01.099
THAN ANY POOR HETERO SCHMUCK,
BECAUSE TRUST ME,

40:01.132 --> 40:02.634
NOTHING PISSES OFF
A STRAIGHT GUY

40:02.668 --> 40:05.671
MORE THAN A SUCCESSFUL FAG.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.573
- YOU KNOW GUERNICA?

40:07.606 --> 40:10.509
PEOPLE SAY IT'S THE MOST
POWERFUL ANTI-WAR STATEMENT

40:10.542 --> 40:11.977
EVER MADE.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.545
I SAY BULLSHIT.

40:13.579 --> 40:17.549
IT HANGS IN A FUCKING MUSEUM,
COLLECTING DUST.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.118
AND THIS IS ALL BULLSHIT.

40:20.151 --> 40:23.689
IT DOESN'T DO
A MOTHERFUCKING THING.

40:32.564 --> 40:35.133
- [sighs]
FUCK CLOTHES.

40:35.166 --> 40:38.937
CHRIST, THEY STINK.
OH, GOD.

40:38.970 --> 40:42.040
I WON'T BE NEEDING THESE.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.717
OR THESE.

40:55.253 --> 40:58.156
OR THESE.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.963
- UH, WAIT.

41:04.996 --> 41:08.500
HOW'S, UH, GIUSEPPE VERDI
A TRIGGER?

41:08.534 --> 41:10.268
- HE WAS HERE WATCHING
THE WHOLE TIME.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.104
- UH, YEAH.

41:13.138 --> 41:17.242
HE WAS ALSO HERE...

41:17.275 --> 41:21.580
THE FIRST TIME YOU PLAYED
LA TRAVIATA FOR ME.

41:21.613 --> 41:24.783
I SAY WE GIVE HIM
A REPRIEVE.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.987
THAT IT?

41:29.020 --> 41:30.956
- ALMOST.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.128
- UH, YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO TRASH THAT?

41:37.162 --> 41:38.864
- NEVER GAVE ME ANYTHING
BUT TROUBLE.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.032
HOOK-UPS, PORN SITES,

41:41.066 --> 41:44.670
NOT TO MENTION ENDLESS EMAILS
TO INCREASE MY DICK SIZE.

41:44.703 --> 41:47.005
- I DON'T RECALL THAT BEING
ONE OF YOUR SHORTCOMINGS.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.507
[both laughing]

42:01.787 --> 42:04.189
- YOU KNOW, EVEN IF I
GOT RID OF EVERY TRIGGER,

42:04.222 --> 42:06.892
EVERY REMINDER...

42:06.925 --> 42:10.696
I'D STILL REMEMBER
WHAT I DID.

42:10.729 --> 42:15.033
GOD, HOW I HURT
THE PEOPLE THAT I LOVED.

42:15.066 --> 42:18.003
- YOU GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT?

42:22.808 --> 42:26.177
- WELL, TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
AFTER REHAB,

42:26.211 --> 42:28.814
WHERE THEY NEVER LEFT YOU ALONE,
I'M-I'M-I'M FEELING

42:28.847 --> 42:32.350
A LITTLE FREAKED,
BEING HERE BY MYSELF.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.120
- I, UH, COULD STAY WITH YOU,
IF YOU'D LIKE.

42:35.153 --> 42:37.656
- OH, NO.
I-I-I COULDN'T ASK--

42:37.689 --> 42:39.958
- IF IT'D MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
[chuckles]

42:39.991 --> 42:45.697
- UM...WELL, UH...

42:45.731 --> 42:47.198
WHERE DO WE--I MEAN--

42:47.232 --> 42:50.101
- I'D CRASH ON THE SOFA.

42:50.135 --> 42:53.939
- YEAH, THE SOFA.
RIGHT, UM...

42:53.972 --> 42:57.242
OF COURSE.
I'LL GET YOU SOME BLANKETS.

43:26.071 --> 43:27.405
SLEEP TIGHT.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.374
- YEAH, YOU TOO.

43:29.407 --> 43:34.312
AND, UH...
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, UH--

43:52.430 --> 43:55.000
- I FEEL THE POWER.

43:55.033 --> 43:58.203
[coyote barking]

43:58.236 --> 44:01.807
- I FEEL THE POWER.

44:01.840 --> 44:05.143
- I FEEL THE POWER TOO.

44:05.176 --> 44:07.746
- NOW, LET US STOKE
OUR FIRES

44:07.779 --> 44:10.181
AND RELEASE OUR BURDENS
INTO THE FLAMES.

44:10.215 --> 44:12.417
- HOLD IT!

44:12.450 --> 44:17.288
I'LL TAKE THAT, DUMPLING.
- HEY.

44:17.322 --> 44:21.359
- I FEEL THE POWER TOO.

44:21.392 --> 44:25.831
MY NAME IS, UH, "ON A CLEAR DAY,
YOU CAN SEE FOREVER."

44:25.864 --> 44:29.167
IT JUST SORT OF CAME TO ME,
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

44:29.200 --> 44:32.203
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME
"CLEAR DAY."

44:32.237 --> 44:34.172
[murmuring]

44:34.205 --> 44:36.174
- THIS IS A HEART CIRCLE,
CLEAR DAY.

44:36.207 --> 44:38.710
WE SHARE OUR FEELINGS HERE.

44:38.744 --> 44:40.445
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE?

44:40.478 --> 44:43.849
- WELL...

44:43.882 --> 44:48.319
THE TRUTH IS, I DIDN'T REALLY
WANT TO COME HERE.

44:48.353 --> 44:51.957
BUT THEN, SOMEHOW,

44:51.990 --> 44:54.926
SOMETHING MAGICAL HAPPENED.

44:54.960 --> 44:58.864
[murmuring agreement]
- ALWAYS DOES.

44:58.897 --> 45:03.034
- I REALIZED THAT IF IT'S TRUE
THAT FAIRIES HAVE THE POWER

45:03.068 --> 45:06.071
TO CREATE BEAUTY
OUT OF UGLINESS

45:06.104 --> 45:09.407
AND JOY OUT OF PAIN,

45:09.440 --> 45:13.111
THEN THAT POWER
CAN ONLY COME FROM ONE PLACE.

45:13.144 --> 45:14.946
- MM-HMM.

45:14.980 --> 45:19.284
- WHICH I-I GUESS
I KNEW ALL ALONG.

45:24.122 --> 45:26.892
- THANK YOU.

45:26.925 --> 45:28.860
RISE, FAIRIES.

45:32.898 --> 45:35.533
WE THANK THE POWERS OF THE EARTH
AND THE HEAVENS

45:35.566 --> 45:38.503
FOR GIVING US
OUR SPECIAL GIFTS.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.872
WE CELEBRATE
OUR FAIRY FOREFATHERS

45:40.906 --> 45:43.975
AND THE GENERATIONS
OF FAIRIES TO FOLLOW,

45:44.009 --> 45:47.979
AND OUR FAIRY FOUNDER,
HARRY HAY.

45:48.013 --> 45:49.848
[all murmur]

45:49.881 --> 45:52.851
- WHERE IS HE, ANYWAY?
- HARRY HAY?

45:52.884 --> 45:55.987
- YEAH, I HELPED HIM
PUT THE ROCKS IN THE CIRCLE.

45:56.021 --> 46:01.159
- HONEY, HARRY PASSED AWAY
TWO YEARS AGO.

46:12.070 --> 46:13.872
