It Says They're Building

44:47.400 --> 44:49.568
Some Kind
Of Thermal Bathing Spa.

44:50.621 --> 44:52.922
[Thunder]

44:59.596 --> 45:01.931
There's A Turn Back There.
We Missed It.

45:01.932 --> 45:03.533
From Now On,
I'm Driving.

45:29.860 --> 45:32.095
Joel, Slow Down.
Please.

45:32.096 --> 45:34.847
I Just Want To Get
The Fuck There Already.

45:34.848 --> 45:36.683
Aah!

45:36.684 --> 45:37.800
Aah!

45:37.801 --> 45:39.319
Jesus.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.487
You Could
Have Killed Us!

45:41.488 --> 45:42.772
Well,
What's This...

45:42.773 --> 45:44.223
Fucking Car
Doing

45:44.224 --> 45:45.491
In The Middle
Of The Road?

45:48.395 --> 45:50.196
Damn It!

45:50.197 --> 45:52.131
[Engine Stalling]

45:55.619 --> 45:56.936
Shit.

45:56.937 --> 45:58.871
[Engine Stalling]

46:01.858 --> 46:03.142
There's No Coverage.

46:09.282 --> 46:10.767
Can You Start It?

46:10.768 --> 46:12.151
Gabriel: There's Nobody
Inside The Car.

46:12.152 --> 46:13.753
Eve: It's Got
To Be Theirs.

46:13.754 --> 46:16.089
Ok, But
It's Still Hot.

46:16.090 --> 46:17.673
It Won't Start.

46:20.894 --> 46:22.595
Look, Footprints.

46:22.596 --> 46:23.847
It's Them.

46:23.848 --> 46:27.033
Look! Let's Go!
Come On!

46:27.034 --> 46:28.083
Come On.

46:30.353 --> 46:31.570
Let's Go!

46:33.406 --> 46:34.590
Come On!

46:34.591 --> 46:35.674
Fine, Fine!

46:52.626 --> 46:54.577
Look, Guys.

46:54.578 --> 46:56.679
The Door's
Been Forced Open.

47:11.728 --> 47:13.730
Oh, Shit.

47:13.731 --> 47:15.080
You Should Have Taken

47:15.081 --> 47:16.332
The Scuba Flashlights
With Us.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.133
They're In The Car.

47:23.623 --> 47:25.041
Susan?

47:26.243 --> 47:27.893
Zoe?

47:27.894 --> 47:29.628
[Rumbling]

47:29.629 --> 47:31.664
What The Hell
Was That?

47:31.665 --> 47:32.948
I'll Have A Look.

47:42.576 --> 47:43.993
Welcome...

47:43.994 --> 47:46.946
To The Nun Witch Project.

47:53.270 --> 47:54.771
[Wings Flapping]

47:54.772 --> 47:56.573
Oh, Shit!

48:03.647 --> 48:05.681
What Was It?

48:05.682 --> 48:09.686
Birds. A Dirty Bathroom
Full Of Birds.

48:09.687 --> 48:12.388
They Must Have Flown In
Through The Broken Windows.

48:14.457 --> 48:17.059
Susan!

48:17.060 --> 48:18.561
Zoe!

48:34.794 --> 48:36.545
Hello?

48:40.483 --> 48:42.151
Zoe?

48:44.070 --> 48:45.938
Susan?

49:32.903 --> 49:34.904
Oh, Yeah.

49:34.905 --> 49:36.706
This Really
Is Some Place.

49:38.425 --> 49:43.145
This Is Exactly Where
I Want To Spend My Vacation.

49:43.146 --> 49:44.597
Stop Filming.

49:47.551 --> 49:49.485
I Don't Like
This Place.

49:52.523 --> 49:53.890
I'll Just...

50:02.599 --> 50:04.534
[Muffled Voices]

50:08.255 --> 50:09.905
There They Are.

50:24.487 --> 50:25.638
Sorry.

50:25.639 --> 50:27.306
And Eve?

50:27.307 --> 50:28.924
Uh...

50:28.925 --> 50:30.476
I Don't Know.

50:30.477 --> 50:31.744
We Lost Her.

50:33.914 --> 50:35.130
Eve!

50:35.131 --> 50:36.716
She's Not Here.

50:36.717 --> 50:37.900
Can't You See It?

50:37.901 --> 50:39.268
She's Not!

50:41.505 --> 50:42.821
And Eulalia.

50:42.822 --> 50:44.990
Where Are Cristy And
Eulalia, For God's Sake?

50:44.991 --> 50:46.308
Susan, Calm Down.

50:46.309 --> 50:48.243
Hello?

50:48.244 --> 50:49.595
Who Are You?

50:50.647 --> 50:51.997
I'm Eve.

50:51.998 --> 50:54.984
Mary O'brien's
Daughter.

50:54.985 --> 50:57.019
[Whispering]
What Is She Doing Here?

50:57.020 --> 50:58.604
Eve...

50:58.605 --> 51:00.740
I'm Zoe.

51:00.741 --> 51:02.241
And This Is--

51:02.242 --> 51:03.292
Susan.

51:06.096 --> 51:07.963
I'm Sorry.

51:07.964 --> 51:10.132
I'm So Sorry.

51:10.133 --> 51:12.334
Eulalia Told Us
About Your Mother.

51:12.335 --> 51:14.670
Eulalia
And Cristy

51:14.671 --> 51:16.305
Are Dead
As Well.

51:19.692 --> 51:22.528
Oh, God's Punishing Us.

51:22.529 --> 51:24.129
But When?

51:24.130 --> 51:25.965
Listen, We've--
We Have To Get Out Of Here

51:25.966 --> 51:27.115
And Call The Police.

51:27.116 --> 51:28.968
We Can't Waste
Any More Time.

51:28.969 --> 51:30.536
Please, Let Us
Get Out Of Here--

51:30.537 --> 51:32.054
Susan, We Can't
Call The Police.

51:32.055 --> 51:33.722
We Didn't
Do It Then,

51:33.723 --> 51:35.725
And We Won't
Do It Now,

51:35.726 --> 51:36.809
Understand?
Do You Understand?

51:40.630 --> 51:41.948
Did You Call Them?

51:43.217 --> 51:44.733
No.

51:46.837 --> 51:49.572
Why Can't We
Call The Police?

51:49.573 --> 51:52.124
I Know
Who Killed My Mother.

51:53.510 --> 51:55.310
It Was Her, The Nun,

51:55.311 --> 51:56.729
Sister Ursula.

51:56.730 --> 51:58.080
I Saw Her.

51:58.081 --> 51:59.682
I've Seen Her
With My Own Eyes.

51:59.683 --> 52:00.732
I Saw Her!

52:00.733 --> 52:01.984
No, I--I...

52:01.985 --> 52:03.920
I Don't Believe You.

52:03.921 --> 52:05.938
That Can't Be True.

52:05.939 --> 52:08.557
Can It, Zoe?

52:08.558 --> 52:09.875
Why?

52:11.444 --> 52:13.162
Go On, Tell Her!

52:13.163 --> 52:14.797
Tell Her!

52:14.798 --> 52:16.248
It Can't Be Her.

52:16.249 --> 52:17.399
Shut Up.

52:18.518 --> 52:20.953
It Can't Be
Sister Ursula.

52:20.954 --> 52:22.521
That's
Impossible.

52:22.522 --> 52:24.589
Why Is That Impossible?

52:26.343 --> 52:28.110
Because...

52:28.111 --> 52:29.528
She's Dead...

52:31.264 --> 52:32.881
[Whispering]
Dead.

52:45.795 --> 52:47.013
Mmm.

52:50.133 --> 52:51.216
There You Are!

52:52.719 --> 52:54.403
What Are You
Up To Now?

52:55.488 --> 52:56.772
Are You Crazy?!

52:56.773 --> 52:57.957
Aah!

52:57.958 --> 53:00.709
Why Is It That You
Always Do The Wrong Thing?

53:00.710 --> 53:02.644
<i>Eulalia: Why Is It
That You're Always</i>

53:02.645 --> 53:04.713
Complaining
About Everything?

53:04.714 --> 53:06.231
Where's Mary?

53:06.232 --> 53:08.133
Why Isn't
She With You?

53:08.134 --> 53:09.818
She's Not In Her Room.

53:09.819 --> 53:12.304
Girl:
Stop! Stop!

53:12.305 --> 53:13.655
Stop!

53:13.656 --> 53:15.591
It's Coming From
The Downstairs Bathroom.

53:15.592 --> 53:17.660
That's Mary's Voice.

53:27.454 --> 53:30.222
[Mary Yelling]

53:31.991 --> 53:33.476
What Are You Doing?!

53:33.477 --> 53:35.995
Purifying Her!
Purifying.

53:35.996 --> 53:37.946
She's Going
To Kill Her!

53:39.315 --> 53:41.817
Stop It!

53:41.818 --> 53:43.368
You Fucking Bitch!
Leave Her Alone!

53:44.837 --> 53:45.955
Get Away!

53:45.956 --> 53:48.457
Susan! Help Her!

53:48.458 --> 53:50.392
Help Me!

53:50.393 --> 53:52.044

53:57.067 --> 53:58.283
Oh, My God.

54:14.151 --> 54:15.401
[All Scream]

54:17.637 --> 54:19.338
Stop,
Don't Kill Her!

54:39.392 --> 54:40.709
This Pond...

54:40.710 --> 54:43.562
It's Supposed To Be
Holy Water, Remember?

54:43.563 --> 54:47.866
The Nuns From The Convent
Purify Themselves Here.

54:47.867 --> 54:52.037
Shit. It's Just
A Normal Fucking Pond.

54:52.038 --> 54:54.573
We've Got To Swear
That We Never,

54:54.574 --> 54:57.826
Ever Tell Anyone
What We've Done

54:57.827 --> 55:00.095
Or What
Happened Here Tonight.

55:11.758 --> 55:12.774
Susan.

55:25.071 --> 55:27.539
[Whispering] Hail Mary,
Full Of Grace...

55:55.134 --> 55:56.786
This Is Crazy.

55:56.787 --> 55:58.421
It's Fucking Crazy!

55:58.422 --> 56:00.255
Take It Easy,
Joel. Come On.

56:00.256 --> 56:02.074
And What Do You
Expect Me To Do

56:02.075 --> 56:03.976
After What
I've Just Heard?

56:03.977 --> 56:05.810
Look, We Should Just
Go To The Nearest Town

56:05.811 --> 56:07.062
And Call The Cops.

56:07.063 --> 56:09.732
The Nearest Town Is
10 Miles Away, Remember?

56:09.733 --> 56:12.384
And We Shouldn't Leave
Them Hanging Here Alone.

56:16.172 --> 56:17.739
I'm Afraid We're The Ones

56:17.740 --> 56:20.409
Who Are Gonna Be
Hung For Being Here.

56:20.410 --> 56:21.827
[Thunder]

56:21.828 --> 56:23.662
It Can't Be True.

56:23.663 --> 56:26.781
My Mother
Never Hurt Anyone.

56:26.782 --> 56:28.517
Why Would
Sister Ursula Want

56:28.518 --> 56:29.602
To Kill My Mother?

56:30.853 --> 56:32.604
Why?

56:32.605 --> 56:33.839
Because She Was--

56:33.840 --> 56:35.491
She Was Crazy.

56:35.492 --> 56:37.226
She Said
That Her Mission Was

56:37.227 --> 56:39.178
To End With All
The Sin In The World

56:39.179 --> 56:41.280
Through
Punishment And Pain.

56:43.933 --> 56:45.283
Maybe
She Didn't Die,

56:45.284 --> 56:46.335
And Now
She's Come Back

56:46.336 --> 56:47.519
To Seek
Her Revenge.

56:47.520 --> 56:49.388
But Why Now,
After 18 Years?

56:49.389 --> 56:50.839
Why Did She
Wait So Long?

56:50.840 --> 56:52.274
The Pond Water...

56:55.378 --> 56:57.513
They Used To Say It Was...

56:57.514 --> 56:59.748
Holy Water.

56:59.749 --> 57:00.983
Can't You See?

57:02.702 --> 57:05.720
The People From The
Thermal Bathing Spa

57:05.721 --> 57:08.941
Dried Out The Pond
2 Weeks Ago.

57:08.942 --> 57:10.975
They Told Us
That In Town.

57:10.976 --> 57:12.361
You Told Me
Joanna Died

57:12.362 --> 57:14.062
Exactly 2 Weeks Ago.

57:15.882 --> 57:18.183
When The Pond
Water Disappeared,

57:18.184 --> 57:20.119
Her Spirit
Was Set Free.

57:22.555 --> 57:24.222
It Won't
Rest In Peace

57:24.223 --> 57:25.891
Until She's Completed
Her Mission,

57:25.892 --> 57:27.109
Remember?

57:27.110 --> 57:28.760
Come On, Susan, Stop!

57:28.761 --> 57:29.778
Shut Up!

57:29.779 --> 57:30.929
Ok?

57:30.930 --> 57:32.047
Ok?

57:32.048 --> 57:34.216
So, Let Me Get
This Straight,

57:34.217 --> 57:37.035
Are You Trying
To Tell Me That All This

57:37.036 --> 57:39.070
Is Some Sort Of...

57:39.071 --> 57:41.106
<i>I Know What You
Did 18 Summers Ago,</i>

57:41.107 --> 57:42.191
Or Something?

57:43.743 --> 57:44.893
Oh, Shit.

57:44.894 --> 57:45.911
I Don't Know
What's Going On.

57:45.912 --> 57:47.396
But We Have To Find Out.

57:47.397 --> 57:50.415
Well, We've Got
All Night.

57:50.416 --> 57:52.751
The 2 Cars
Are Still Fucked,

57:52.752 --> 57:54.653
And With This Rain,

57:54.654 --> 57:57.022
It's Better Not To
Try And Go Outside.

57:58.591 --> 58:01.426
She'll Never
Let Us Out Of Here.

58:01.427 --> 58:03.946
We'll Pay For Our Sins.

58:03.947 --> 58:06.115
And You, Too!

58:06.116 --> 58:08.617
This Is Just...
Superstitions.

58:08.618 --> 58:09.802
I Don't
Think So, Joel.

58:09.803 --> 58:10.919
Sometimes
There Are Things

58:10.920 --> 58:12.104
That Have
No Explanation.

58:12.105 --> 58:13.606
Eve: Everything
Has An Explanation.

58:13.607 --> 58:15.357
It's Just A Case
Of Finding It.

58:17.293 --> 58:18.910
Where's Her Room?

58:18.911 --> 58:20.646
Upstairs.

58:20.647 --> 58:21.930
The Staircase
At The End

58:21.931 --> 58:23.631
Of The
Corridor.

58:23.632 --> 58:24.883
[Thunder]

58:36.412 --> 58:38.747
She's Here.

58:38.748 --> 58:40.431
I Know She's Here.

58:43.152 --> 58:45.688
Wait. I'll
Go With You.

58:45.689 --> 58:48.156
Here. You'll Need This.

58:49.992 --> 58:51.660
Zoe: Th--There Was
An Electricity Meter

58:51.661 --> 58:52.911
In The Room
Near The Entrance.

58:58.168 --> 58:59.101
Let's Go.

59:09.279 --> 59:11.180
I'm Really Happy
You Came With Us.

59:12.565 --> 59:14.433
I Know How
Important It Is

59:14.434 --> 59:16.151
To Feel Like
Somebody Believes You.

59:17.853 --> 59:19.788
With You I Feel--

59:19.789 --> 59:21.005
Safe?

59:21.006 --> 59:22.524
Is That What You
Were Gonna Say?

59:22.525 --> 59:24.193
Oh, No.
That's Not...

59:24.194 --> 59:25.277
That's Not It.

59:28.898 --> 59:32.717
Since You Told Me
About The Accident...

59:35.305 --> 59:37.873
I Feel Like I've Known
You For A Long Time.

59:37.874 --> 59:39.808
You Know, In A Certain Way,

59:39.809 --> 59:41.193
Both Of Us Feel Responsible

59:41.194 --> 59:42.528
For What's Happened To Us.

59:42.529 --> 59:44.179
Do You Know,

59:44.180 --> 59:47.399
I Didn't Always Get
Along With My Mother.

59:47.400 --> 59:49.067
There Were
So Many Questions

59:49.068 --> 59:50.919
I Had To Ask Her.

59:50.920 --> 59:52.321
It Was Something That--

59:52.322 --> 59:53.221
I Know.

59:54.307 --> 59:55.423
What?

59:55.424 --> 59:58.509
Joanna Told Me About
Your Mother In The Park.

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:19.798
This Is Crazy.

01:00:19.799 --> 01:00:23.318
Absolutely Fucking Crazy.

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:25.520
Something Happened
To My Mother.

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:27.723
Something...

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:30.125
Like An Accident
Or Something.

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:34.329
I Was Really Young,

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.949
And My Memory Somehow
Erased Everything.

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:38.667
If You Can't Remember...

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:42.337
It Must Be For
A Good Reason.

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:47.509
Try Not
To Torture Yourself.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.077
[Whispering] Ok.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.033
[Thunder]

01:00:57.236 --> 01:00:58.870
Those Women Are Nuts.

01:00:58.871 --> 01:01:00.739
And Eve...

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.057
It's Like...

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.275
She Didn't Have
Enough As It Is.

01:01:03.276 --> 01:01:04.426
No, On Top Of That,

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:05.977
She Believes
What That Priest Says.

01:01:05.978 --> 01:01:08.263
Joel, We Have
To Help Her.

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:10.215
She's Having
A Hard Time.

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:24.078
Know What I Think?

01:01:24.079 --> 01:01:26.665
I Think Eve Is Finally Gonna
Go For A Swim In The Lake.

01:01:26.666 --> 01:01:28.834
What Does That Fucking
Test Mean Anyway?

01:01:28.835 --> 01:01:30.418
Uh, According To Harley...

01:01:31.971 --> 01:01:34.823
Good Lake, Good Sex.

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.625
Bad Lake...

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:37.709
Stupid Boys.

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:04.536
"To Sister Ursula
From Father Miguel."

01:02:07.089 --> 01:02:08.473
Miguel...

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:12.094
Hey, What's Wrong?

01:02:15.348 --> 01:02:17.865
I Think I, Uh...

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.021
What Are You
Talking About?

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:57.572
The Dog.

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:59.341
Dead Woman's Dog.

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:00.892
I Liked It,

01:03:00.893 --> 01:03:03.027
And We Shouldn't Have
Just Left It Behind.

01:03:03.028 --> 01:03:05.514
Look, We Have More
Important Things To Do.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.994
And Then There Was Light!

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.930
Hey...

01:03:22.931 --> 01:03:25.033
That Should Hold Up
Without Blowing Out.

01:03:28.454 --> 01:03:30.421
Um...

01:03:30.422 --> 01:03:31.840
I'm Just Nervous.

01:03:33.259 --> 01:03:35.427
Don't Worry.
I Know You By Now.

01:03:36.963 --> 01:03:39.797
Remembering What
We Used To Call It?

01:03:39.798 --> 01:03:41.432
Yeah.

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:44.953
Susan's Inquisitor.

01:03:48.441 --> 01:03:50.008
Not Here.

01:03:50.009 --> 01:03:51.392
Ok?

01:03:52.778 --> 01:03:56.314
Not In The Room
Of The Monster

01:03:56.315 --> 01:03:58.783
That Killed
My Mother.

01:03:58.784 --> 01:04:01.153
You Saw What
She Did To Eulalia.

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:03.722
What Did You Say?

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:06.775
Gabriel,

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.944
It's Not That I
Don't Want--

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:10.812
Eulalia...

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.814
Why Didn't I Think
Of That Before?

01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:16.301
Come With Me!

01:04:16.302 --> 01:04:17.619
No, No, No.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.421
Wait Here.

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:20.972
I'll Be Back In A Minute.

01:04:20.973 --> 01:04:22.774
I'll Go Check Something.

01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:24.809
But What--Wait.

01:04:42.662 --> 01:04:44.496
[Squish]

01:04:52.554 --> 01:04:55.207
[Water Gurgling]

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:25.236
[Screams]

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.408
[Telephone Rings]

01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:33.060
[Ring]

01:05:33.061 --> 01:05:36.781
You Stupid Brat!
Keep Out Of My Things!

01:05:36.782 --> 01:05:37.866
[Ring]

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:39.401
Miguel?

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.818
Where Are You?
At The Airport?

01:05:40.819 --> 01:05:42.587
You're Not?
Mommy!

01:05:42.588 --> 01:05:43.839
[Ring]

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.657
What's Wrong, Mom?

01:05:45.658 --> 01:05:46.892
Mom!

01:05:46.893 --> 01:05:48.776
Eve, I've Just
Discovered How--

01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:51.596
Hey...

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:55.800
What Happened?

01:05:55.801 --> 01:05:56.852
Are You All Right?

01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:00.238
I Just
Remembered Something.

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:03.625
My--My Mother...

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:07.729
When I Was
A Little Girl...

01:06:11.317 --> 01:06:13.852
We're Going To Pay
For What We Did.

01:06:13.853 --> 01:06:16.120
And Eve, Too.

01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:17.922
You Know That, Don't You?

01:06:17.923 --> 01:06:19.590
What Are You
Talking About?

01:06:19.591 --> 01:06:21.410
Come On, You Know
What I'm Talking About.

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:25.964
When I Saw Her
With That Young Man...

01:06:25.965 --> 01:06:28.766
[Whispering]
With A Priest...

01:06:28.767 --> 01:06:32.087
It's History
Repeating Itself.

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.922
It's All Over, Now.

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:37.709
It's All Right.

01:06:39.512 --> 01:06:41.029
Everything's Gonna Be Fine.

01:06:46.118 --> 01:06:47.852
Listen, Eve...

01:06:50.289 --> 01:06:52.390
I've Discovered
How She's Doing It.

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:55.643
What?

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:57.846
It Was Right
Under Our Noses,

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.881
And I Didn't
Realize It Until Now.

01:07:02.484 --> 01:07:03.835
Come With Me.

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.492
We--We Can't Let Her Do It.

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:12.510
We Have To Tell Her!

01:07:12.511 --> 01:07:14.479
We Swore To Mary
We'd Never Tell.

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:24.205
Where's Eve?

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:26.858
She's Not Back Yet.

01:07:26.859 --> 01:07:30.177
I Don't Know What
She Thinks She'll Find,

01:07:30.178 --> 01:07:32.413
Except For
Rats And Bird Shit.

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:39.937
You Guys!

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.674
You Have
To Come And See

01:07:42.675 --> 01:07:45.526
What Gabriel Found
In The Corridor.

01:07:45.527 --> 01:07:46.678
Come On.

01:07:46.679 --> 01:07:47.796
Follow Me.

01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:05.347
Gabriel:
St. Eulalia.

01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:10.068
Crucified.

01:08:14.973 --> 01:08:16.358
Gabriel:
St. Joanna.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.810
Eve: Burnt At The Stake.

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:20.879
She's Giving
Them The Same Death

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.630
As Their Patron Saints.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:27.952
Gabriel: St. Mary.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.090
Her Throat Cut.

01:08:36.796 --> 01:08:38.430
Saint Christine.

01:08:41.198 --> 01:08:43.067
Her Arms Cut Off.

01:08:43.068 --> 01:08:45.854
I Forgot About
These Paintings, I...

01:08:47.238 --> 01:08:49.274
Oh, Jesus!

01:08:51.843 --> 01:08:54.078
Crazy Motherfucker!

01:08:54.078 --> 01:08:57.098
Now We Know What The
Old Bitch Is Doing!

01:08:57.099 --> 01:09:00.518
In Her Way, She's Trying
To Purify Her Guilt.

01:09:00.519 --> 01:09:02.420
Punishment And Penitence.

01:09:03.738 --> 01:09:05.606
Pain And Sacrifice

01:09:05.607 --> 01:09:09.093
To Gain God's Forgiveness.

01:09:09.094 --> 01:09:11.095
Saint Zoe,

01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:13.398
Burnt In An Oven.

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:16.283
Bullshit!

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:17.968
Fucking Bitch!

01:09:17.969 --> 01:09:20.371
Listen Up,
You Whore!

01:09:20.372 --> 01:09:21.872
You Hear Me?

01:09:21.872 --> 01:09:23.524
You Hear Me?

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:24.926
I Already
Killed You Once,

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:26.277
And I'll
Do It Again!

01:09:26.278 --> 01:09:27.761
The Only One
That's Facing

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.764
Punishment And
Penitence Is You!

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.100
Can You
Hear Me, Bitch?

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.135
You're Dead!

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.071
Dead! I Killed You!

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:45.796
Saint Ursula.

01:09:45.796 --> 01:09:49.651
An Arrow Thrown
Through Her Heart.

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:51.452
That's
What You Want.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:54.773
Then That's
What You'll Get.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.974
Gabriel: Zoe,
Where Are You Going?

01:09:56.975 --> 01:09:58.476
Zoe, Zoe,
Where Are You Going?

01:09:58.477 --> 01:09:59.410
Zoe!

01:10:06.935 --> 01:10:09.387
Susan, Come On!

01:10:09.388 --> 01:10:11.655
God...

01:10:11.656 --> 01:10:13.608
I Don't Want To Die.

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:16.160
Not Like That.

01:10:16.161 --> 01:10:17.478
[Whispering]
Please.

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:18.830
Not Like That.

01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:19.981
Susan,

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.166
Just Try And Calm Down.

01:10:21.167 --> 01:10:22.967
Everything Will Be Ok.

01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:23.985
We're Gonna Help Help You.

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:25.002
That's Why We Came.

01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:26.321
Just Try And Calm Down.

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:28.556
Nothing Will Be Ok.

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:32.193
We're Condemned.

01:10:33.846 --> 01:10:35.029
And You More
Than Anyone Else.

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:36.998
Susan.

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:40.184
You're Responsible
For All Of This.

01:10:40.185 --> 01:10:42.019
You!

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.722
You Are The Sin!

01:10:44.723 --> 01:10:46.457
Go Away.

01:10:46.458 --> 01:10:48.526
Go Away.

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.362
Get Away From Me!

01:10:51.363 --> 01:10:53.848
What The Hell Are
You Talking About?

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:55.366
Susan!

01:10:55.367 --> 01:10:57.368
For God's Sake, Calm Down!

01:11:11.933 --> 01:11:13.251
Go Away!

01:11:13.252 --> 01:11:15.152
[Thunder]

01:11:15.153 --> 01:11:16.170
Susan!

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.421
Leave Me Alone!

01:11:17.422 --> 01:11:20.308
I Don't
Understand, Susan.

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:23.061
Just Leave Me Alone.

01:11:23.062 --> 01:11:24.345
Leave Me Alone.

01:11:31.937 --> 01:11:33.054
[Slams]

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:34.205
Oh!

01:11:37.392 --> 01:11:39.527
She's Here.

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:41.111
I Know She's Here!

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:44.566
Oh! Oh! No!

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.658
No!

01:11:53.659 --> 01:11:54.809
Susan!

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:55.926
Susan!

01:11:55.927 --> 01:11:58.129
Please Open This Door!

01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:59.681
Oh!

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:02.100
She's Come
To Punish Us.

01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:03.250
[Thunder]

01:12:06.705 --> 01:12:08.523
Zoe.

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:10.592
What Are You
Doing With That?

01:12:10.593 --> 01:12:12.293
I'm Going
To Give Her A Taste

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:13.478
Of Her Own Medicine.

01:12:13.479 --> 01:12:14.496
I'll Kill Her

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:16.114
The Same Way
St. Ursula Died.

01:12:16.115 --> 01:12:18.532
Maybe She'll
Leave Us In Peace.

01:12:18.533 --> 01:12:19.818
I'm Not
About To Sit Here

01:12:19.819 --> 01:12:21.068
And Wait
For Her To Come.

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.655
Wait.

01:12:24.656 --> 01:12:26.123
What About
Eve And Susan?

01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:27.275
I Thought
They Were On Their Way.

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:28.259
I'll Go With Her.

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.910
You Go And Look
For The Others, Ok?

01:12:29.911 --> 01:12:31.545
Ok. Come On.
Let's Go Find Them.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.435
Hail Mary,
Full Of Grace.

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:38.787
The Lord Is With Thee.

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:40.321
Eve: Please Open The Door!

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:42.823
Blessed Art Thou
Among Women,

01:12:42.824 --> 01:12:45.743
