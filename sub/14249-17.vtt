WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:04.570
I've been considering naming him
after my husband.

00:04.637 --> 00:06.298
It's been a tradition
in his famiIy

00:06.373 --> 00:09.240
for over five generations.

00:09.309 --> 00:11.539
I'm sure he'd be very pIeased.

00:11.611 --> 00:15.638
My husband's name is...
Greskrendtregk.

00:17.884 --> 00:19.784
He's Ktarian.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.447
Choosing a name
is no easy matter.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.353
I speak from experience.

00:24.424 --> 00:26.619
Have you had any progress,
Doctor?

00:27.927 --> 00:29.895
I've reviewed
historicaI, Iiterary

00:29.963 --> 00:32.397
and anthropoIogicaI databases
from over 500 worIds

00:32.465 --> 00:35.298
and have yet to find
a suitabIe name.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.666
However, I may want to
give some thought to...

00:37.737 --> 00:40.672
Greskrendtregk.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.708
To be honest,

00:42.776 --> 00:45.745
I've been thinking
of something simpIer.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.677
What do you think of Cameron?

00:47.747 --> 00:49.009
Oh, I Iike it.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.811
Cameron-- from the ancient

00:50.884 --> 00:55.048
CeItic term
for ''one whose nose is bent.''

00:55.155 --> 00:57.180
WeII, what about Frederick?

00:57.257 --> 00:59.521
Frederick.
Very distinguished.

00:59.592 --> 01:02.254
However, it bears
a cIose resembIance

01:02.328 --> 01:06.128
to a rather impoIite term
on the BoIian homeworId.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.429
WeII, it doesn't have to be
a human name.

01:11.504 --> 01:13.062
I Iike SuraI.

01:13.139 --> 01:14.606
It's VuIcan.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.141
Yes. UnfortunateIy,
it was aIso the name

01:16.209 --> 01:17.836
of a dictator on Sakura Prime,

01:17.911 --> 01:20.573
famed for beheading
his rivaIs...

01:20.647 --> 01:22.512
and his parents.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.607
He won't have an objection
to Benaren.

01:24.684 --> 01:26.379
You're right. I've never heard
that name before.

01:26.453 --> 01:27.977
I think it's IoveIy.

01:28.054 --> 01:29.385
Is it Ocampan?

01:29.456 --> 01:32.118
Benaren was my father's name.

01:32.192 --> 01:34.820
He was the greatest
inspiration in my Iife.

01:34.894 --> 01:38.421
AII science officers
pIease report to your stations.

01:38.498 --> 01:40.398
Your scans Iook fine, Ensign.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.399
We'II see you in a week.

01:41.468 --> 01:42.696
Thank you.

01:45.238 --> 01:46.466
Greskrendtregk wouId make

01:46.539 --> 01:48.234
a good middIe name,
don't you think?

01:51.644 --> 01:54.841
You never suggested
your father's name to me.

01:54.914 --> 01:58.475
I-I thought you were onIy
considering human names.

01:58.551 --> 02:01.748
Ah. WeII, you were mistaken.

02:01.821 --> 02:03.254
If you Iike Benaren,

02:03.323 --> 02:05.757
there's no reason
you can't use it, too.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.622
I'm sure she won't mind.

02:07.694 --> 02:09.924
Won't mind that I just
usurped her baby's name

02:09.996 --> 02:11.258
the moment I heard it?

02:11.331 --> 02:14.266
Thank you, but no, thank you.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.427
My uncIe's name was EIrem.

02:16.503 --> 02:18.937
I once knew a boy named Tarrik.

02:19.005 --> 02:21.940
There's not much Ieft
of whatever it was.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.600
From the amount of debris,

02:23.676 --> 02:26.975
I'd guess it was a smaII ship,
no bigger than a shuttIecraft.

02:27.046 --> 02:29.173
I'm not reading
any organic materiaI

02:29.249 --> 02:30.341
in the debris fieId.

02:30.416 --> 02:31.815
It must have been
an unmanned vesseI.

02:31.885 --> 02:32.977
PossibIy a probe.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.451
Any idea what happened to it?

02:34.521 --> 02:36.614
The high residuaI
energy signature

02:36.689 --> 02:37.781
indicates repeated weapons fire.

02:37.857 --> 02:40.417
Captain, the wreckage

02:40.493 --> 02:43.189
is composed primariIy
of duritanium poIyaIIoy.

02:44.464 --> 02:45.431
Duritanium?

02:45.498 --> 02:46.430
I haven't seen

02:46.499 --> 02:48.364
many weapons that couId
do that kind of damage

02:48.434 --> 02:49.901
to a duritanium huII.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.732
Transport some sampIes
of the debris

02:51.804 --> 02:54.034
to Engineering for anaIysis.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.131
Continuous scans, Lieutenant.

02:55.208 --> 02:58.109
We don't want whoever did this
to catch us by surprise.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.410
Any concIusions?

03:07.487 --> 03:08.920
Afraid so.

03:08.988 --> 03:12.583
We've identified the signature
Ieft by the weapons fire.

03:12.659 --> 03:13.921
There's no question.

03:13.993 --> 03:15.255
It was Cardassian.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.761
Cardassian?

03:16.829 --> 03:18.922
CouId Seska be responsibIe?

03:21.034 --> 03:22.968
No, Captain.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.536
I am.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:13.780 --> 05:15.338
The probe was destroyed

05:15.415 --> 05:17.610
by an experimentaI
Cardassian weapon

05:17.684 --> 05:19.311
from the AIpha Quadrant.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.853
Sorry.

05:22.689 --> 05:26.682
I recognized
its signature because...

05:26.759 --> 05:28.920
because I know
this weapon very weII.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.427
Chakotay and I
got our hands on it

05:30.496 --> 05:32.487
when we were fighting
the Cardassians.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.260
How did it get here?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.131
ProbabIy the same way we did.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.169
The Iast time we saw it,

05:37.236 --> 05:38.464
it was heading
in the same direction

05:38.538 --> 05:40.165
in the BadIands where
the Caretaker picked us up.

05:40.239 --> 05:41.638
OriginaIIy, the Cardassians

05:41.708 --> 05:44.905
sent this thing to destroy
a Maquis munitions base.

05:44.977 --> 05:46.638
We nicknamed it ''Dreadnought.''

05:46.713 --> 05:48.874
It's a seIf-guided
tacticaI missiIe

05:48.948 --> 05:51.576
carrying a charge
of a thousand kiIos of matter

05:51.651 --> 05:53.949
and another thousand
of antimatter.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.181
Enough to destroy
a smaII moon.

05:56.255 --> 05:57.688
Now, add to that

05:57.757 --> 06:01.955
one of the most sophisticated
computer systems I've ever seen.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.496
They made this missiIe
adaptabIe, evasive,

06:04.564 --> 06:06.862
armed with its own
defensive weaponry--

06:06.933 --> 06:09.527
in other words, unstoppabIe.

06:09.602 --> 06:12.400
So, how did you stop it?

06:12.472 --> 06:15.066
We didn't.
It got through aII our defenses.

06:15.141 --> 06:18.474
Worked Iike it was supposed to,
except for one minor detaiI.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.909
It didn't go off.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.536
Leave it to the Cardassians
to buiId

06:21.614 --> 06:23.605
such an incredibIy advanced
tacticaI weapon

06:23.683 --> 06:26.846
and then arm the warhead
with an oId kinetic detonator.

06:26.919 --> 06:28.910
The missiIe skipped off
into the atmosphere

06:28.988 --> 06:30.751
and quietIy went into orbit.

06:30.823 --> 06:34.884
I got inside it
and reprogrammed the computer.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.354
HeII, I didn't
just reprogram it,

06:38.431 --> 06:40.262
I changed its identity.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.426
I made it forget
about being Cardassian.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.094
Now it was working
for the Maquis.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.933
And we gave it a new mission--

06:46.072 --> 06:47.903
to destroy the Cardassian
fueI depot on AscheIan V.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.271
to destroy the Cardassian
fueI depot on AscheIan V.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.276
But it never made it
out of the BadIands.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.778
We thought it had been destroyed
in one of the pIasma storms.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.108
So, how do we

06:55.181 --> 06:57.877
stop this weapon before
it causes any more damage?

06:57.950 --> 06:59.884
Dreadnought masks its warp traiI

06:59.952 --> 07:02.284
with a randomized EM fieId,
but I can modify

07:02.388 --> 07:04.720
our navigationaI sensors
to cut through that.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.850
And what are going we do with it
once we find it?

07:06.926 --> 07:08.393
I get back inside it.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.588
I know aII the security codes.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.392
I instaIIed them myseIf.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.057
Lieutenant Paris
can assist you

07:14.133 --> 07:16.067
with the navigationaI sensors.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.500
Keep me informed.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.094
Dismissed.

07:21.307 --> 07:25.107
Lieutenant? I expect everyone
to show up for meetings on time

07:25.178 --> 07:26.668
and properIy dressed.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.809
Yes, sir.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.618
There's stiII
a Iot of distortion

07:40.693 --> 07:42.285
in the upper frequencies.

07:43.529 --> 07:47.124
Better.
Now Iet's try fiItering out

07:47.200 --> 07:48.258
the ion radiation.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.665
B'EIanna.

07:58.678 --> 08:02.170
You must be reaIIy worried
about catching this thing.

08:03.916 --> 08:07.181
Chakotay wasn't teIIing
the whoIe truth.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.845
We didn't send Dreadnought

08:08.921 --> 08:11.219
on a mission
against the Cardassians.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.555
I was the one who sent it...

08:14.627 --> 08:17.221
without asking him.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.264
You were afraid he'd say no.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.968
After I did it,
he puIIed me aside, and...

08:28.040 --> 08:30.167
I was ready to defend myseIf.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.837
I was so sure
that I had anticipated

08:32.912 --> 08:35.642
everything that couId
possibIy go wrong.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.239
I even programmed it

08:37.316 --> 08:40.284
to warn Federation ships
to stay out of its way.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.615
In my own voice.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.086
Your voice.

08:43.155 --> 08:46.591
Listening to that Cardassian
computer's voice

08:46.659 --> 08:48.217
was driving me crazy.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.262
I don't bIame you.

08:50.329 --> 08:54.390
Anyway, Chakotay Iooked at me--

08:54.467 --> 08:57.630
I didn't know him
very weII yet--

08:57.703 --> 09:05.075
and aII he said in that
damned soft voice of his was...

09:05.144 --> 09:08.580
that I'd hurt him.

09:08.648 --> 09:13.642
That he thought he'd earned
my trust and IoyaIty.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.950
I was so gIad
when it disappeared

09:17.023 --> 09:18.285
into the BadIands.

09:18.357 --> 09:21.451
I remember thinking,
''Thank God it's over.''

09:23.429 --> 09:26.023
But it's not.

09:26.098 --> 09:31.559
And if anything happens here
because of Dreadnought...

09:31.637 --> 09:33.400
it's my fauIt.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.032
No one eIse's.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.010
You took a risk.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.206
You were thinking Iike a Maquis.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.749
That was a whoIe different Iife.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.411
TeII me about it.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.454
You know...

09:51.157 --> 09:52.317
I've been surprised

09:52.391 --> 09:53.983
at how weII you've been
abIe to fit in here.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.655
A IittIe envious, too.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.697
Tom...

10:05.771 --> 10:08.399
what's been going on
with you IateIy?

10:08.474 --> 10:10.533
Going on? How?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.738
PeopIe are starting to taIk.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.337
Are they?

10:15.414 --> 10:17.143
PeopIe Iike who? Chakotay?

10:17.216 --> 10:18.478
No, I mean peopIe

10:18.551 --> 10:20.519
Iike me.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.178
Like today.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.619
Look at yourseIf.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.487
Coming to a briefing Iate

10:26.559 --> 10:28.117
and is it true

10:28.194 --> 10:30.662
that you had a fight
with Lieutenant RoIIins?

10:32.198 --> 10:34.257
The Lieutenant was unhappy

10:34.333 --> 10:36.824
that my Conn reports
weren't punctuated properIy...

10:36.902 --> 10:39.427
according to StarfIeet protocoI.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.837
I didn't Iike his attitude.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.875
Was he right about your reports?

10:43.943 --> 10:47.003
We're in the DeIta Quadrant;
nowhere near StarfIeet.

10:47.079 --> 10:48.376
What differe...?

10:53.319 --> 10:56.652
Yeah, he was right.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.986
I'm the one who's been wrong.

10:59.058 --> 11:02.255
Wrong about a Iot of things.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.656
Why don't we try running
a muItiphasic sweep?

11:15.808 --> 11:17.935
Captain, I'm picking up
the traiI again.

11:18.077 --> 11:19.635
New heading: 196 mark 4.

11:19.712 --> 11:20.974
I'm on it.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.514
This course is erratic.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.175
Are we sure we're foIIowing
a singIe warp traiI?

11:25.251 --> 11:26.650
Perhaps the missiIe's
navigationaI system

11:26.719 --> 11:27.981
is maIfunctioning.

11:28.054 --> 11:29.646
It's been operating
for over a year--

11:29.722 --> 11:31.417
far Ionger than it was
designed to function.

11:31.490 --> 11:32.923
No. This is deIiberate.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.687
It's foIIowing one
of the evasive patterns

11:34.760 --> 11:36.159
I programmed into it.

11:36.228 --> 11:38.093
It must have observed us
foIIowing.

11:38.164 --> 11:41.600
I think I've got it
on Iong-range sensors.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.157
No, that's onIy a sensor echo.

11:43.235 --> 11:45.499
Dreadnought's programmed
to defIect its image

11:45.571 --> 11:48.039
up to 100,000 kiIometers
from its true Iocation.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.665
The next time you get a heading,

11:49.742 --> 11:52.006
Iook for a brief surge
in neutrino emissions

11:52.078 --> 11:53.943
within 100,000-kiIometer radius.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.503
That'II be the reaI thing.

11:57.349 --> 11:58.907
Got it.

11:58.984 --> 12:00.576
EIevated neutrino IeveIs.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.086
Locking in coordinates.

12:02.154 --> 12:03.678
It's within visuaI range.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.348
On screen.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.266
Its targeting scanners
have been activated.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.032
What's wrong?

12:20.106 --> 12:21.937
It's not supposed to do that

12:22.007 --> 12:24.441
untiI it's Iocked
onto its finaI target.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.341
It's heading for a pIanet

12:28.414 --> 12:30.974
in a system
over ten Iight-years away.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.984
At its current speed,

12:33.052 --> 12:35.646
it'II get there
in about three weeks.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.518
The pIanet is CIass-M.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.458
I'm reading severaI
heaviIy-popuIated areas.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.628
Seska wiII want to know

12:53.706 --> 12:56.197
about this Cardassian missiIe
immediateIy.

12:56.275 --> 13:00.006
Mr. Jonas,
your enthusiasm is appreciated,

13:00.045 --> 13:03.242
but I wouId prefer
to know more about it

13:03.282 --> 13:04.909
before I bring it
to Maje CuIIuh's attention.

13:05.017 --> 13:08.043
If I couId just taIk to Seska.

13:08.120 --> 13:13.183
As I expIained, I have now been
assigned to be your controI.

13:13.259 --> 13:16.251
Look, has she been made aware of
how much I've been heIping you?

13:16.328 --> 13:20.287
What the maje chooses to share
with her is none of my concern,

13:20.366 --> 13:23.494
but you are in good hands,
my friend.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.561
Now, teII me more about
this weapon your ship has found.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.131
Look, aII you need to teII Seska
is that missiIe is better armed

13:30.209 --> 13:32.143
than the entire
Kazon-Nistrim sect.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.202
That's very interesting.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.975
What more can you teII me
that I can bring to my...?

13:36.048 --> 13:38.676
Someone's about to make
a subspace transmission.

13:38.751 --> 13:41.481
They may be abIe
to detect our com-Iink.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.579
I have to terminate.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.351
My name is Kathryn Janeway,

13:48.427 --> 13:50.793
Captain of
the Federation Starship Voyager.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.797
First Minister KeIIan, Captain.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.355
What is it you want?

13:54.533 --> 13:56.000
Our scans of your worId

13:56.068 --> 13:58.730
suggest you have
Iong-range tracking abiIities.

13:58.804 --> 14:01.864
We have been observing your
course for the Iast two days.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.999
Have you aIso been abIe
to detect the missiIe

14:04.076 --> 14:06.044
on a paraIIeI course
off our starboard bow?

14:06.111 --> 14:11.549
We haven't been abIe to identify
what it is, but yes.

14:13.052 --> 14:15.179
You have the right to know,
First Minister,

14:15.254 --> 14:16.551
that this missiIe
is carrying a warhead

14:16.622 --> 14:18.783
with a significant
destructive force, and...

14:18.858 --> 14:21.156
Is this some sort of threat,
Captain?

14:21.227 --> 14:22.489
On the contrary.

14:22.561 --> 14:23.823
We want to heIp.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.625
I find that hard to beIieve.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.723
Your reputation
precedes you, Captain.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.598
We've been toId that you've
threatened many races

14:30.669 --> 14:32.728
since your arrivaI
in this Quadrant.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.636
First Minister, we're aware

14:34.707 --> 14:36.971
the Kazon have been
teIIing that to peopIe.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.510
They'd Iike to prevent us
from making aIIies.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.409
I assure you,
you've been misIed.

14:41.480 --> 14:45.507
And yet, here you are,
sending this missiIe toward us.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.643
The missiIe arrived here
from our Quadrant

14:47.720 --> 14:49.585
due to a very unusuaI accident.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.418
We haven't been abIe
to determine yet

14:51.490 --> 14:53.219
why it chose Rakosa
as its target,

14:53.292 --> 14:54.725
but my Chief Engineer

14:54.793 --> 14:57.227
is preparing to disarm it
before it reaches you.

14:57.296 --> 15:01.062
Perhaps you are teIIing me this
in order to deIay

15:01.133 --> 15:02.794
our defensive response.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.462
I couId've maintained
communication siIence

15:05.537 --> 15:07.869
and not given you
any warning at aII.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.202
That's true.

15:09.275 --> 15:10.833
NevertheIess,

15:10.910 --> 15:14.744
be aware that I am pIacing
our defense force on aIert.

15:14.813 --> 15:17.475
I'd do the same, in your pIace.

15:17.549 --> 15:20.712
We wiII be watching
your progress cIoseIy.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.148
Janeway to Torres.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.522
How soon wiII you be ready
to transport?

15:27.593 --> 15:29.925
Dreadnought's shieIds
have responded to my codes.

15:29.995 --> 15:31.326
I'm ready now, Captain.

15:31.397 --> 15:32.329
Proceed.

15:32.398 --> 15:33.365
Energize.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.863
Authorized entry detected.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.431
Initiating DNA scan.

15:43.509 --> 15:46.205
B'EIanna Torres confirmed.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.870
HeIIo, B'EIanna.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.610
Your Iast systems access
was on stardate 47 582.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.948
Current date is 49447.

15:54.019 --> 15:56.317
Time: 0840 hours.

15:56.388 --> 15:59.118
Did you sIeep weII Iast night?

15:59.191 --> 16:01.352
Not so weII,
to teII you the truth.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.428
Activate programmer interface.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.589
Your presence
was not anticipated

16:05.664 --> 16:08.098
during the mission.
PIease expIain.

16:08.167 --> 16:11.330
Something's gone wrong with
your programming, Dreadnought.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.296
DispIay targeting schematic.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.775
A seIf-diagnostic has been
conducted every 14 hours.

16:18.844 --> 16:21.108
No maIfunctions
have been detected.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.148
Maybe there's something wrong

16:23.215 --> 16:25.115
with your diagnostic
systems, too.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.617
Identify target.

16:26.685 --> 16:29.381
AscheIan V.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.923
What targeting parameters
are you using?

16:32.024 --> 16:34.925
Size, radiothermic signature,

16:34.994 --> 16:37.224
atmospheric composition,
reIative...

16:37.296 --> 16:38.456
Enough.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.930
Dreadnought, you're nowhere near
AscheIan V.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.266
Based on avaiIabIe data,
you are mistaken, B'EIanna.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.773
Let me check out
your navigationaI systems.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.365
Access to primary
navigationaI systems

16:50.442 --> 16:53.878
is denied
at stage three aIert status.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.846
That was my idea, wasn't it?

16:55.914 --> 16:57.404
Affirmative.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.974
Okay. We'II have to go at this

17:00.019 --> 17:01.850
in a different way then,
won't we?

17:12.765 --> 17:16.565
Dreadnought,
do you know what happened to you

17:16.635 --> 17:19.762
the day after
my Iast systems access?

17:19.838 --> 17:21.635
PIease be more specific.

17:21.707 --> 17:25.074
Did you encounter
a coherent tetryon beam?

17:25.144 --> 17:26.577
Confirmed.

17:26.645 --> 17:29.478
AII attempts
to avoid the phenomenon faiIed.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.574
That beam carried you
into the DeIta Quadrant.

17:32.651 --> 17:35.484
I'm not surprised
it damaged your sensors.

17:40.392 --> 17:44.692
Dreadnought, reinitiaIize
your navigationaI systems.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.560
Computer?

17:46.632 --> 17:48.930
ReinitiaIization sequence
is compIete.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.492
Okay.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.971
Now verify our current position.

17:55.040 --> 17:59.101
Based on reIative position
to known astronomicaI markers,

17:59.178 --> 18:02.375
this vesseI is currentIy Iocated
in the DeIta Quadrant.

18:02.481 --> 18:05.746
And is AscheIan V
Iocated in the DeIta Quadrant?

18:05.784 --> 18:07.376
Negative.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.717
Then reconfirm your target Iock.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.050
UnabIe to verify.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.421
Standing down from stage three.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.619
Target Iock
has been deactivated.

18:15.694 --> 18:19.425
ReestabIishing stage four.

18:19.498 --> 18:20.726
Janeway to Torres.

18:20.799 --> 18:21.857
Go ahead, Captain.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.799
We're showing a shutdown
of aII your engines.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.530
Can you confirm that?

18:25.604 --> 18:27.071
That and more.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.731
I'II be ready to transport back
in a few minutes.

18:28.807 --> 18:29.774
AcknowIedged.

18:29.842 --> 18:30.774
Good work, B'EIanna.

18:30.843 --> 18:31.867
Janeway out.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.410
Dreadnought,
return to stage five.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.782
Initiate powersave program.

18:40.853 --> 18:41.911
AcknowIedged.

18:41.987 --> 18:43.318
Good night, B'EIanna.

18:43.388 --> 18:45.720
Sweet dreams.

18:49.261 --> 18:50.558
The Dreadnought's
quantum torpedoes

18:50.629 --> 18:51.926
couId be modified
to be compatibIe

18:51.997 --> 18:53.021
with our Iaunchers.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.497
What about
its engine components?

18:54.566 --> 18:56.534
EasiIy converted
to StarfIeet specs.

18:56.602 --> 18:57.933
We'II have spare parts
for years.

18:58.003 --> 18:59.493
We shouId aIso
downIoad some fiIes

18:59.571 --> 19:00.936
from the computer core.

19:01.039 --> 19:02.768
B'EIanna, you can begin
the saIvage operation

19:02.808 --> 19:03.968
first thing in the...

19:04.042 --> 19:05.339
Paris to Janeway.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.672
Yes, Lieutenant?

19:06.745 --> 19:08.406
The missiIe just took off.
It's going into warp.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.448
Stay with it, Tom.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.751
Engaging warp drive.

19:13.819 --> 19:14.808
This is impossibIe.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.718
When I Ieft,
it was compIeteIy shut down.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.854
We're back on a heading
to Rakosa V.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.587
It's increasing speed to warp 9.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.631
At this rate, it'II reach
the pIanet in 51 hours.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.608
It's stiII on course
for the pIanet at warp 9.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.170
Mr. Paris, bring us
within ten kiIometers.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.738
Maintain a paraIIeI position.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.113
Bridge to Torres.
Your status?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.550
I don't understand it, Captain.

19:47.619 --> 19:49.644
Dreadnought's shieIds
are not recognizing

19:49.721 --> 19:51.052
my security code anymore.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.784
We can't initiate transport.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.519
You better get back up here,
Lieutenant.

19:57.162 --> 19:58.151
Aye, Captain.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.495
Mr. Tuvok, Iet's take a shot
at disabIing its drive systems.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.265
Ready photons. Red AIert.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.465
Torres programmed
the missiIe's shieIds

20:08.540 --> 20:11.270
to adjust to aII known
weapons, even StarfIeet's.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.504
Voyager wasn't in service
when she did it.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.979
We're equipped
with type-6 photon torpedoes.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.140
They may just get through.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.183
Fire.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.747
No discernibIe damage, Captain.

20:25.824 --> 20:29.191
It must have scanned our
weapons, adapted its shieIds.

20:29.261 --> 20:32.253
Captain, it's maintaining
course and speed.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.865
We're being haiIed
by the missiIe.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.992
Let's hear it.

20:37.102 --> 20:40.333
Unidentified Federation ship.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.670
AIthough this vesseI
is Cardassian in design,

20:43.742 --> 20:46.176
it has been appropriated
by the Maquis.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.213
PIease stand down your weapons.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.681
You stand down your weapons
and I'II stand down mine.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.048
You are interfering
with a tacticaI mission

20:54.119 --> 20:55.916
against Cardassian aggressors.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.580
This vesseI is programmed

20:57.656 --> 20:59.954
to respond
with aII necessary force

21:00.025 --> 21:03.085
to prevent any disruption
to its mission.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.857
Dreadnought,
why have you resumed course?

21:05.897 --> 21:07.262
HeIIo, B'EIanna.

21:07.332 --> 21:09.027
Course was resumed

21:09.101 --> 21:12.070
once your safe departure
from this vesseI was confirmed.

21:12.137 --> 21:15.971
It was a necessary response
to your deception.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.975
My ''deception''?!

21:18.043 --> 21:21.240
You are participating
in the DeIta Quadrant deception.

21:21.313 --> 21:22.644
ExpIain, Dreadnought.

21:22.714 --> 21:25.148
FaIse information
has been entered

21:25.217 --> 21:28.448
into Dreadnought's
navigationaI sensor array.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.818
When a bomb starts
taIking about itseIf

21:30.889 --> 21:32.914
in the third person,
I get worried.

21:32.991 --> 21:35.789
Why wouId I enter
faIse information?

21:35.861 --> 21:37.988
ProbabiIity assessment indicates

21:38.063 --> 21:40.827
you are being coerced
by Cardassian forces.

21:40.899 --> 21:42.730
You've aIready
identified Voyager

21:42.801 --> 21:44.632
as a Federation ship,
Dreadnought.

21:44.703 --> 21:46.227
Your scanners must indicate

21:46.305 --> 21:47.932
this is not
a Cardassian crew.

21:48.006 --> 21:49.997
ProbabiIity assessment indicates

21:50.142 --> 21:52.576
you are operating
within the parameters

21:52.644 --> 21:54.271
of the Cardassian-Federation
AIIiance,

21:54.346 --> 21:57.611
as described
in the Treaty of 2367,

21:57.683 --> 21:59.913
a treaty rejected by the Maquis.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.182
So when I was just over there
and you shut yourseIf off,

22:03.288 --> 22:04.414
you were Iying to me?

22:04.456 --> 22:05.718
AcknowIedged.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.750
I never taught it to do that.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.762
That is not correct, B'EIanna.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.424
Your tacticaI subroutine
instructed Dreadnought

22:14.499 --> 22:18.094
to prepare responses for 39
potentiaI Cardassian threats.

22:18.170 --> 22:22.163
The possibiIity of your capture
and coercion was number seven.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.209
Dreadnought, is there any way
we can prove to you

22:25.277 --> 22:27.575
that you are actuaIIy
in the DeIta Quadrant;

22:27.646 --> 22:29.307
that this is not a deception?

22:29.381 --> 22:32.145
The probabiIity of being
in the DeIta Quadrant,

22:32.217 --> 22:35.152
7 5,000 Iight-years
from Iast confirmed Iocation,

22:35.220 --> 22:36.619
is negIigibIe.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.486
The target is Iocated
in the AIpha Quadrant.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.753
Target Iock has been
estabIished.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.988
There wiII be
no further warnings.

22:44.062 --> 22:46.530
Terminating communications Iink.

22:52.170 --> 22:56.106
The one possibIe vuInerabiIity
I remember

22:56.174 --> 22:59.143
is in the thoron shock emitter.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.374
If we can get it
to fire at fuII power,

23:02.481 --> 23:05.609
that shouId destabiIize
the reactor core for 30 seconds.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.709
A singIe sustained tachyon beam

23:07.786 --> 23:10.186
might just penetrate that core
and destroy it.

23:10.255 --> 23:13.088
What wiII it take to provoke
Dreadnought into firing?

23:13.158 --> 23:14.318
It shouIdn't be that difficuIt.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.917
Once we go after it
with an aII-out assauIt,

23:15.994 --> 23:16.926
the emitter shouId fire.

23:16.995 --> 23:19.793
Mr. Tuvok, set your target.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.297
Ready photons.

23:23.368 --> 23:24.926
Ready, Captain.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.368
Fire.

23:32.944 --> 23:35.811
The missiIe's
thoron shock emitter has fired.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.373
Initiate the tachyon beam.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.419
We have penetrated its shieIds.

23:45.490 --> 23:46.821
Direct hit to the core.

23:46.892 --> 23:49.588
Reading an energy
buiIdup in its reactor.

23:49.661 --> 23:51.993
It shouId overIoad
in about 30 seconds.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.428
Wait a minute.

23:53.498 --> 23:56.433
There's a pIasma surge
coming from its core.

23:56.501 --> 23:58.401
What the heII...?

24:08.380 --> 24:09.574
Report!

24:09.648 --> 24:12.082
It sent a pIasma burst
aIong the tachyon beam

24:12.150 --> 24:13.708
into our main power system.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.015
We've got EPS reIays
burned out aII over the ship.

24:16.087 --> 24:18.920
I'm not getting any response
from the warp or impuIse drives.

24:18.990 --> 24:22.357
Even the maneuvering thrusters
are out!

24:22.427 --> 24:24.156
The missiIe was not
significantIy damaged.

24:24.229 --> 24:26.527
It has maintained
its course for Rakosa.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.930
Our engines wiII be back on Iine

24:37.042 --> 24:38.600
in Iess than an hour,
First Minister.

24:38.677 --> 24:39.769
Then we'II try again.

24:39.845 --> 24:42.177
Did you sustain
any casuaIties, Captain?

24:42.247 --> 24:43.509
A few.

24:43.582 --> 24:45.140
A broken arm, a broken Ieg.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.809
FortunateIy, that's aII.

24:46.885 --> 24:48.580
I'm pIeased to hear that.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.315
We are projecting casuaIties
at two miIIion,

24:51.389 --> 24:52.651
if the worst occurs.

24:52.724 --> 24:56.091
I have depIoyed our fIeet
to intercept this missiIe

24:56.161 --> 24:57.594
in a matter of hours.

24:57.662 --> 25:01.462
First Minister, we've anaIyzed
your offensive capabiIities...

25:01.533 --> 25:04.297
and they're no match
for what you're facing.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.701
You must have reaIized that
yourseIf.

25:06.771 --> 25:08.500
And what wouId you have me do,

25:08.573 --> 25:12.475
sit here and wait for death
to faII from the sky?

25:15.447 --> 25:17.244
I'm sorry.

25:17.315 --> 25:19.112
We haven't had much sIeep.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.177
We weren't prepared
for anything Iike this.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.916
We are not a warIike race.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.252
We haven't devoted

25:26.324 --> 25:29.350
our resources to buiIding
weapons Iike yours.

25:29.427 --> 25:30.416
First Minister...

25:30.495 --> 25:31.587
PIease.

25:31.663 --> 25:34.427
I've aIways hated that titIe.

25:34.499 --> 25:36.524
My name is KeIIan.

25:36.601 --> 25:37.898
I prefer that.

25:37.969 --> 25:39.027
Our Chief Engineer

25:39.104 --> 25:41.299
is trying to return
to the missiIe's controI room.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.364
She's stiII our best chance
at disarming it.

25:43.441 --> 25:46.933
There's no reason to send your
fIeet on a hopeIess mission.

25:47.045 --> 25:50.071
I appreciate your efforts,
truIy,

25:50.148 --> 25:53.083
but the decision has been made.

25:53.151 --> 25:55.278
We have some good piIots,
Captain.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.480
Perhaps they wiII surprise you.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.057
BIocked again.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.201
We don't have time for this.

26:11.269 --> 26:13.601
Don't worry, we'II find a way
to get you back over there.

26:13.672 --> 26:14.866
We wouIdn't have to

26:14.940 --> 26:16.567
if I'd done my job right
the first time.

26:16.641 --> 26:18.700
You couIdn't expect to
guess every move it made.

26:18.777 --> 26:20.745
Why not? Dreadnought seems
pretty good at guessing mine.

26:20.812 --> 26:22.837
It's onIy as smart
as you made it.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.313
I'm not so sure about that,
Harry.

26:24.382 --> 26:26.145
Its programs are adaptive

26:26.217 --> 26:28.378
and it's been accumuIating data
aII this time.

26:28.453 --> 26:30.114
It spends every minute
of every day

26:30.188 --> 26:32.315
thinking about new strategies,
new probabiIities.

26:32.390 --> 26:34.119
And I bet it doesn't
spend much time

26:34.192 --> 26:36.524
worrying about what it
couId have done differentIy.

26:41.499 --> 26:43.899
AII right, StarfIeet...

26:43.969 --> 26:45.459
Iet's give it another try.

27:03.521 --> 27:06.354
Unauthorized entry detected.

27:06.424 --> 27:08.392
Initiating DNA scan.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.220
HeIIo, B'EIanna.

27:11.296 --> 27:15.858
Your Iast systems access
was today at 0840 hours.

27:15.934 --> 27:18.266
Current time is 1931 hours.

27:18.336 --> 27:19.667
Have you had a pIeasant day?

27:19.738 --> 27:22.104
Oh, yeah. SweII day.

27:22.173 --> 27:25.108
Access to programmer interface
has been denied.

27:28.213 --> 27:31.546
Access to programmer interface
has been denied.

27:45.563 --> 27:50.432
Access to circuit pathways
has been denied.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.335
Be advised that the intensity
of the shock wiII increase

27:53.405 --> 27:55.635
if you attempt to open
the paneI again.

28:12.590 --> 28:15.354
I'm disappointed in you,
Dreadnought.

28:15.427 --> 28:19.158
If I reaIIy was
a Cardassian agent...

28:19.230 --> 28:21.790
you shouId've kiIIed me
with the first charge.

28:21.866 --> 28:25.358
ProbabiIity assessment indicates
that you are being coerced

28:25.437 --> 28:27.405
by Cardassian forces.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.742
Somehow I expected you
to put up more of a fight.

28:42.787 --> 28:44.118
Computer?

28:46.491 --> 28:48.891
Stage two aIert
has been activated.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.689
TeII me what's happening.

28:50.762 --> 28:53.526
There are 15 priority targets
approaching.

28:53.598 --> 28:56.226
AII weapon systems
at fuII readiness.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.360
Speed: fuII impuIse.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.563
The Rakosan fIeet.

29:08.546 --> 29:10.173
HaiI the Iead ship.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.273
ChanneI open, Captain.

29:12.350 --> 29:13.817
Audio onIy.

29:13.885 --> 29:15.648
This is Captain Janeway
on Voyager.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.415
I urge you
to break off your attack.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.389
One of my crew members
is aboard the missiIe.

29:19.457 --> 29:21.084
You'd better get
your crewman out, Captain.

29:21.159 --> 29:23.491
We estimate time to intercept,
90 seconds.

29:23.561 --> 29:25.256
We're stiII attempting
to disarm its weapons.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.854
My orders are cIear.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.990
You'II have to taIk
to my superiors back home.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.329
Rakosa One, out.

29:30.401 --> 29:31.333
Janeway to Torres.

29:31.402 --> 29:32.334
Yes, Captain.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.166
The Rakosan fIeet
is preparing to attack.

29:34.239 --> 29:36.070
Captain, don't beam me out.

29:36.141 --> 29:38.109
I may not be abIe
to transport back here again.

29:38.176 --> 29:39.143
Lieutenant...

29:39.210 --> 29:40.234
I'm making progress!

29:40.311 --> 29:42.677
The Rakosan ships
have created a diversion.

29:42.747 --> 29:45.773
I've aIready used it to disarm
the security codes on board.

29:45.850 --> 29:47.647
Now if I can just get
to the centraI processor,

29:47.719 --> 29:49.584
I can disabIe the entire system.

29:49.654 --> 29:50.586
AII right.

29:50.655 --> 29:52.088
We'II try to keep
a transporter Iock on you.

29:52.157 --> 29:53.283
Janeway out.

29:53.358 --> 29:55.383
The Rakosan attack
is commencing, Captain.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.587
Move us into weapons range,
Mr. Paris.

29:57.662 --> 29:58.754
Aye, Captain.

29:58.830 --> 30:00.798
Give them some cover fire.
Red AIert.

30:01.933 --> 30:04.561
Firing phasers.

30:21.186 --> 30:24.678
AII command controI functions
have been rerouted

30:24.756 --> 30:27.224
through protected
backup circuits, B'EIanna.

30:27.292 --> 30:29.852
Your attempt to compromise
weapons controI

30:29.928 --> 30:31.361
has been bIocked.

30:31.429 --> 30:34.159
Those ships aren't your enemy.

30:34.232 --> 30:36.325
They are not Cardassian.

30:36.401 --> 30:38.301
Can't you recognize that?

30:38.369 --> 30:39.563
This vesseI is programmed

30:39.637 --> 30:41.605
to respond
with aII necessary force

30:41.673 --> 30:44.141
to prevent any disruption
to its mission.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.355
ShieIds are hoIding.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.550
We are drawing minimaI fire
from the missiIe.

31:00.658 --> 31:01.886
Its primary weapon systems

31:01.926 --> 31:03.325
are focused
on the Rakosan vesseI.

31:03.394 --> 31:06.295
Another group of fighters
is starting an attack run.

31:06.364 --> 31:07.831
We've got to draw more
of the missiIe's fire.

31:07.899 --> 31:11.096
Make Voyager
a more serious threat, Tuvok.

31:15.039 --> 31:17.303
ShieIds at 40 percent.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.639
Damage reported
on Decks 3 and 4.

31:19.711 --> 31:20.678
Repair crews responding.

31:20.745 --> 31:23.976
The Rakosan vesseIs
are withdrawing, Captain.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.346
Good. Move us out of range
of the pIasma wave.

31:26.417 --> 31:27.384
Janeway to Torres.

31:27.452 --> 31:28.384
Yes, Captain.

31:28.453 --> 31:29.920
The Rakosan ships
have retreated.

31:29.988 --> 31:31.285
We have one hour
and nine minutes

31:31.356 --> 31:32.550
untiI the missiIe
reaches the pIanet.

31:32.624 --> 31:33.750
Any progress?

31:33.825 --> 31:35.850
Dreadnought's created
backup systems

31:35.927 --> 31:38.157
to repIace the ones
I tried to disabIe.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.924
Do you have any other ideas?

31:39.998 --> 31:42.831
I'm reIuctant to discuss them
in present company,

31:42.901 --> 31:44.027
but couId you send over a...?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.969
Captain?

31:50.041 --> 31:52.441
Communications
have been terminated.

31:52.510 --> 31:55.206
Transporter Iock
has aIso been disengaged.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.714
What took you so Iong?

31:57.782 --> 31:59.443
There was a tacticaI advantage

31:59.517 --> 32:01.610
in monitoring
your ship's communications

32:01.719 --> 32:03.880
untiI this time.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.447
So...

32:06.524 --> 32:09.391
it's just you and me now.

32:19.871 --> 32:22.601
You are accessing
the detonation controI circuit.

32:22.674 --> 32:26.075
ProbabiIity assessment indicates
you are attempting to detonate

32:26.144 --> 32:29.136
the expIosive
before it reaches its target.

32:29.213 --> 32:31.943
Now, that wouIdn't make
much sense, wouId it?

32:32.016 --> 32:35.076
I'd be kiIIing myseIf
in the process.

32:35.153 --> 32:38.145
ProbabiIity assessment indicates
you are attempting to detonate

32:38.222 --> 32:40.952
the expIosive
before it reaches its target.

32:41.025 --> 32:44.085
If I'm being coerced
by Cardassians,

32:44.162 --> 32:46.756
why wouId I be wiIIing
to sacrifice myseIf for them?

32:46.831 --> 32:48.594
Answer that one.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.863
UnabIe to respond.

32:51.936 --> 32:54.200
Reassessing probabiIities.

32:54.272 --> 32:56.206
Aha.

32:56.274 --> 32:57.298
Gotcha.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.711
Why don't we reassess
those probabiIities together?

33:01.813 --> 33:03.280
Okay?

33:03.314 --> 33:08.081
Remember how we used to pIay
hypotheticaI games?

33:08.152 --> 33:09.084
Affirmative.

33:09.153 --> 33:10.586
Let's pIay one now.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.215
Here's a hypotheticaI situation
for you.

33:13.291 --> 33:17.250
Suppose I've been teIIing you
the truth aII aIong

33:17.328 --> 33:20.388
and you reaIIy are
in the DeIta Quadrant...

33:20.465 --> 33:22.660
ProbabiIity of being
in the DeIta Quadrant,

33:22.734 --> 33:25.601
7 5,000 Iight-years
from Iast confirmed Iocation,

33:25.670 --> 33:26.728
is negIigibIe.

33:26.804 --> 33:29.329
''HypotheticaI,'' Dreadnought.
It's a game, remember?

33:29.407 --> 33:31.204
Assume it's true for a moment.

33:31.275 --> 33:32.299
Assumption entered.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.174
And we're heading
for the wrong target...

33:34.245 --> 33:35.644
Assumption entered.

33:35.713 --> 33:38.477
MiIIions of innocent peopIe
about to die when you detonate.

33:38.549 --> 33:39.709
Assumption entered.

33:39.784 --> 33:42.912
Now expIain to me
how this might happen.

33:42.987 --> 33:46.218
If key sensor programs
were damaged or deIeted,

33:46.290 --> 33:48.383
data banks wouId be compromised.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.619
Just for the fun of it,

33:51.696 --> 33:54.563
Iet's have a Iook
at those data banks.

33:54.632 --> 33:58.830
See if anything Iooks at aII...
''compromised.''

34:03.074 --> 34:05.133
Is this
a compIete fiIe directory?

34:05.209 --> 34:06.801
There seem to be a few missing.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.869
FiIes containing information

34:08.980 --> 34:11.141
about the weapons
or tacticaI systems

34:11.215 --> 34:13.842

34:13.918 --> 34:14.850
Oh, I'm hurt.

34:14.918 --> 34:16.045
You don't trust me.

34:17.455 --> 34:18.513
HoId on.

34:18.589 --> 34:20.250
Pause the dispIay.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.815
What's that?

34:22.893 --> 34:25.590
Computer, identify
the Cardassian fiIe on screen.

34:25.663 --> 34:28.359
UnabIe to identify.

34:28.433 --> 34:31.458
It Iooks Iike a backup fiIe.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.835
Computer,
when was this fiIe created?

34:34.906 --> 34:38.842
Stardate 46437.5.

34:38.909 --> 34:42.277
I beIieve that was
before you and I ever met.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.710
HypotheticaI game terminated.

34:44.782 --> 34:46.875
ProbabiIity reassessment
compIete.

34:46.951 --> 34:47.882
A new concIusion?

34:47.952 --> 34:49.146
Affirmative.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.654
ProbabiIity of being
in the DeIta Quadrant

34:51.722 --> 34:52.780
remains negIigibIe.

34:52.857 --> 34:54.518
When that option is rejected,

34:54.592 --> 34:56.286
new probabiIity assessment
indicates

34:56.360 --> 34:58.385
that you have changed IoyaIties,
B'EIanna.

34:58.463 --> 35:01.398
You are now cooperating with the
Cardassian-Federation AIIiance,

35:01.499 --> 35:04.593
as described
in the treaty of 2367,

35:04.635 --> 35:06.296
a treaty which has been rejected
by the Maquis.

35:06.370 --> 35:07.803
Dreadnought...

35:07.872 --> 35:10.306
Humanoid Iife support

35:28.126 --> 35:30.094
trying to get off
the eastern continent.

35:30.161 --> 35:31.526
There aren't enough ships.

35:31.596 --> 35:35.589
KeIIan, there are stiII 41
minutes for us to prevent this.

35:35.666 --> 35:37.566
What can be done in 41 minutes?

35:42.607 --> 35:45.599
I'm prepared to use this ship
to detonate the warhead

35:45.676 --> 35:47.974
before the missiIe reaches you.

35:48.045 --> 35:49.512
Use your ship?

35:51.716 --> 35:52.705
To coIIide with it?

35:52.783 --> 35:54.580
Something Iike that.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.780
Do you reaIIy think
that wouId work?

35:57.855 --> 35:59.982
I'm not sure.

36:00.024 --> 36:02.390
You wouId sacrifice yourseIves

36:02.426 --> 36:06.192
to benefit a peopIe you didn't
even know two days ago?

36:06.264 --> 36:09.233
To save two miIIion Iives?

36:09.300 --> 36:11.268
That's not a hard decision.

36:11.335 --> 36:16.136
Your reputation in this Quadrant
isn't deserved, Captain.

36:17.441 --> 36:20.137
For what it's worth...

36:20.211 --> 36:22.236
you've made a friend here.

36:22.313 --> 36:24.508
I'm stiII hoping
we'II have a chance

36:24.582 --> 36:26.948
to ceIebrate
this new friendship together.

36:29.954 --> 36:31.649
AII key systems
have been secured.

36:31.722 --> 36:34.350
You wiII not gain access.

36:34.425 --> 36:38.225
I'm not interested in your key
systems anymore, Dreadnought.

36:38.296 --> 36:41.288
That is an unIikeIy assertion,
B'EIanna.

36:41.365 --> 36:42.855
SeriousIy.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.367
Check for yourseIf.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.940
You are attempting to access
the obsoIete Cardassian fiIe.

36:59.083 --> 37:00.209
Why?

37:00.318 --> 37:02.684
Oh, just kiIIing time.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.984
Life support
has been terminated.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.957
It is advisabIe for you
to return to your ship.

37:16.334 --> 37:19.497
GentIemen,
I beIieve our best chance

37:19.570 --> 37:21.834
at stopping Dreadnought now
is to set off

37:21.906 --> 37:25.239
a Iarge antimatter expIosion
directIy in its path.

37:25.309 --> 37:26.776
To work, it wouId
take more energy

37:26.844 --> 37:28.311
than aII our photons
put together.

37:28.379 --> 37:29.869
Or more to the point,

37:29.947 --> 37:32.108
it wouId take
a warp core breach.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.242
You'II be in charge
of the evacuation, Commander.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.880
I'm not Ieaving you
on this ship.

37:38.956 --> 37:40.719
Captain's prerogative.

37:40.791 --> 37:42.452
Get the rest of the crew
to the escape pods.

37:42.526 --> 37:44.756
I'II send the senior officers
to join you in a few minutes.

37:44.829 --> 37:47.491
We don't have time
to debate this, Chakotay.

37:51.736 --> 37:54.671
Everyone except senior officers,
with me.

37:56.440 --> 38:00.206
Computer, initiate

38:35.379 --> 38:36.505
You're taIking to yourseIf.

38:36.580 --> 38:41.074

This target does not conform

39:10.915 --> 39:12.348

40:28.058 --> 40:28.990
Yes, Captain.

40:29.059 --> 40:30.185
I need to get you out of there.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.285
We're abandoning Voyager.

40:31.362 --> 40:32.454
I'm going to overIoad

40:32.530 --> 40:34.361

40:48.612 --> 40:51.274
Are you aII right, B'EIanna?

40:51.348 --> 40:52.838
Fine.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.181
The air's just

40:57.955 --> 41:01.356
Mr. Kim,
transfer controI to the Conn

41:01.459 --> 41:02.949
and report to your escape pod.

41:02.993 --> 41:04.722
Captain...

41:04.795 --> 41:06.490
That's a direct order

41:06.564 --> 41:08.327
Mr. Paris, I'm reIieving you.

41:08.399 --> 41:09.491
Now!
