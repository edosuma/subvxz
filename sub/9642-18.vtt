And that's how a unicorn can help you roast mash mallow.

00:11.680 --> 00:15.690
Well, class, that completes your
final delinquent course lesson.

00:17.690 --> 00:19.960
Time to start the review.
Open to page one.

00:21.690 --> 00:23.760
We gotta go over the whole thing?

00:23.800 --> 00:26.500
Yeah, we do.
Professor Crumbs

00:26.530 --> 00:27.870
is sending a teacher's assistant here

00:27.900 --> 00:30.870
to take us to the Hall of
Wizards to help us review.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.770
I hope it's not a pretty lady,

00:32.810 --> 00:35.640
'cause all they want to do
is pinch my cheeks.

00:36.810 --> 00:38.680
Wizzy! Wizzy! Wizzy!

00:38.710 --> 00:39.910
Oy! Oy! Oy!

00:39.950 --> 00:41.680
You are my people.

00:41.710 --> 00:43.980
And you are still so cute.

00:44.020 --> 00:46.950
See? Pretty lady.

00:49.820 --> 00:51.920
Alex, you're no longer in this class.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.960
We're waiting on a new teacher's
assistant from WizTech, so please leave.

00:54.990 --> 00:58.860
I don't want you to be here all, "Hey, how's it goin'?
Cute shoes, by the way."

00:58.900 --> 01:01.700
I mean, you are right about one thing.

01:01.730 --> 01:04.739
Your new TA does have cute shoes.

01:04.769 --> 01:06.810
No!

01:06.840 --> 01:09.870
Ding, ding, ding, we have
a winner! I'm your new T.A.!

02:06.870 --> 02:07.900
Oh, hi, Harper.

02:07.930 --> 02:09.729
Hi. Oh, hey, Alex.

02:09.770 --> 02:11.640
Do you remember making this
in kindergarten?

02:11.670 --> 02:12.770
Nope.

02:12.810 --> 02:15.740
Exactly, 'cause you didn't.

02:15.780 --> 02:17.710
I made it so the teacher
wouldn't know you ditched.

02:17.740 --> 02:19.830
Oh, yeah, we got that system
down pretty early, didn't we?

02:19.840 --> 02:21.250
Oh, yeah, we did.

02:22.650 --> 02:24.820
Why would you keep all this stuff?

02:24.850 --> 02:27.620
It's for my scrapbook
of childhood memories.

02:27.650 --> 02:30.720
Now that we've graduated,
the last page with my diploma.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.700
Oh, man!
That wasn't the last page.

02:37.730 --> 02:40.530
There's one more page left.
What do I do?

02:41.800 --> 02:44.840
Here. This is the cover
of the magazine you read

02:44.870 --> 02:46.600
the day you finished your scrapbook.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.670
Aw, thanks.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.970
Hey, scrapbooks are a great idea.

02:50.010 --> 02:51.880
Can't wait to look back
on the time I, uh...

02:51.910 --> 02:54.910
...I left the water
running in the bathtub.

02:54.950 --> 02:57.950
Wait, that's right now.

02:57.980 --> 03:01.690
Do we have scrapbooks for the kids?

03:01.720 --> 03:02.950
Well, sort of.

03:02.990 --> 03:05.560
I've got all their artwork and achievements

03:05.590 --> 03:06.790
in those boxes in the hallway.

03:06.830 --> 03:08.860
The ones that are labeled
"Alex," "Justin" and "Max."

03:08.890 --> 03:10.900
Oh, I thought those were suggestion boxes.

03:10.930 --> 03:15.700
I've been putting complaints in
there about the kids for years.

03:15.740 --> 03:20.470
No wonder no one's changed.

03:20.510 --> 03:23.910
So that's why Dad stopped
complaining to our faces.

03:25.710 --> 03:27.750
Here are the kids' memory boxes.

03:27.780 --> 03:29.580
And they're a lot lighter,

03:29.620 --> 03:31.720
now that I've taken
the complaints out of 'em.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.560
Look! Justin's "I learned
how to crawl" certificate

03:37.590 --> 03:38.960
that he printed for himself.

03:38.990 --> 03:40.760
How do you know he printed it?

03:40.790 --> 03:44.730
Because, here's his "I learned how
to use a printer" certificate.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.700
Oh, here's my award
for "Most Absences."

03:48.730 --> 03:52.540
Oh! Honey, that's...
that's not an award,

03:52.570 --> 03:56.670
that's an angry letter from a teacher.

03:56.710 --> 04:00.610
Well, it says "Most",
so I'm calling it an award.

04:00.650 --> 04:03.780
Uh-oh.
Max only has one thing.

04:03.820 --> 04:07.590
It's a receipt for three boxes
at a $1.99 each.

04:07.620 --> 04:11.560
You paid a $1.99
for these?

04:11.590 --> 04:14.630
What's wrong with a paper bag?

04:14.660 --> 04:18.630
Well, I guess with each kid
I saved less stuff.

04:18.660 --> 04:21.529
So, you didn't save any memories for Max?

04:21.570 --> 04:23.640
- Art projects?
- They're so messy.

04:23.670 --> 04:24.700
Grades?

04:24.740 --> 04:27.940
Nobody wants to remember those.

04:27.970 --> 04:30.610
His birth certificate?

04:30.640 --> 04:32.840
You've seen him.
What more proof do you need?

04:34.680 --> 04:36.550
I think Harper's right, Jerry.

04:36.580 --> 04:40.490
We're horrible parents for not
saving any of Max's memories.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.950
You know, if you want to be good parents,

04:41.990 --> 04:44.520
you could start by
taking us to a real doctor

04:44.560 --> 04:47.890
instead of posting symptoms on the Internet
and asking people what they think.

04:49.860 --> 04:51.560
Well, what are we gonna do, Theresa?

04:51.600 --> 04:53.970
I mean, it's not like we can
recreate all of Max's work

04:54.000 --> 04:55.570
from over the years.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.000
Or can we?

05:01.540 --> 05:04.940
Ah, Hall of Wizards.
Now, take a look around.

05:04.980 --> 05:07.750
This place is full of relics
that will help you review.

05:07.780 --> 05:09.810
Yeah, but look at all this stuff in here.

05:09.850 --> 05:11.780
We'll never be ready.
We're doomed!

05:11.820 --> 05:14.590
Justin, we're fine.

05:14.620 --> 05:15.690
That's why I'm here.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.590
OK. Can anybody tell me
what this is?

05:18.620 --> 05:20.690
Ooh, that's the famous
Waterfall of Wikkenberry.

05:20.730 --> 05:21.790
Correct.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.760
You can drink as much
of this water as you want,

05:23.800 --> 05:25.500
and you never have to pee.

05:25.530 --> 05:27.930
My mom makes me drink it
on long flying carpet trips.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.640
Not bad, huh, Justin?

05:31.670 --> 05:34.540
OK, yeah, but there's still
a lot of stuff in here to know.

05:34.570 --> 05:36.470
Whoa, look, guys.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.640
It's the famous "Wand
in the Crystal Ball."

05:38.680 --> 05:41.810
This is the most powerful wand
in the Wizard World.

05:41.850 --> 05:44.550
It once belonged to
the Great Wizard Renaldi

05:44.580 --> 05:46.480
until a jealous warlock stole it,

05:46.520 --> 05:48.650
and plunged it into this crystal ball.

05:48.690 --> 05:52.620
Legend states it can only be removed
by a descendent of Renaldi.

05:52.660 --> 05:55.460
Wow, Felix.
You really know your stuff.

05:55.490 --> 05:57.560
Thanks, I like your stuff, too.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.600
I mean... I don't know
what I mean, I'm sorry.

06:08.540 --> 06:10.440
I'm not the descendent.

06:10.480 --> 06:13.480
I'm still just the son of a wizard plumber.

06:15.450 --> 06:16.920
'Cause you're so cute.

06:16.950 --> 06:21.750
The legend also states that there are
no known descendents of Renaldi.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.420
So there's no point in trying.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.630
Hello, class.

06:29.660 --> 06:32.660
Welcome to the Hall of Wizards
for your review.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.770
Professor Crumbs.
Good to see you.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.670
Question. Did you give
your beard a Brazilian blowout?

06:37.700 --> 06:39.800
'Cause it looks silky and smooth.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.570
It does, doesn't it?

06:44.810 --> 06:46.880
This is Cragmont.

06:46.910 --> 06:49.780
When the time comes,
he will administer the test

06:49.820 --> 06:53.480
that will show how much
Wizard World knowledge

06:53.520 --> 06:54.790
you have acquired.

06:54.820 --> 06:56.420
- Hmm.
- Uh-huh.

06:56.460 --> 07:00.490
Yes, well, I'm not only
the administrator of the test,

07:00.530 --> 07:04.600
but I'm also the Wizard World historian.

07:04.630 --> 07:07.700
How many of you know that the oldest relic

07:07.730 --> 07:11.440
in this room is...

07:11.470 --> 07:13.870
Well, actually, it's Crumbs.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.810
It's true.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.550
And I've dated some of
the relics in this room.

07:20.580 --> 07:23.510
- Hello, Ida.
- Uh-huh.

07:23.550 --> 07:25.820
Justin, you've done an extraordinary job

07:25.850 --> 07:28.390
with these delinquents and I'm confident

07:28.420 --> 07:31.460
that they will pass with flying colors.

07:31.490 --> 07:34.530
Uh-huh. So,
you're Justin Russo.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.430
Yes, well...

07:36.460 --> 07:39.860
Professor Crumbs has told me
that you're extraordinary.

07:39.900 --> 07:42.770
Yes, as a matter of fact,
it's extraordinary

07:42.800 --> 07:47.470
how many times he's told me
you're extraordinary.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.770
I have great hopes for you, Justin.

07:49.810 --> 07:51.610
Someday your statue will be here

07:51.640 --> 07:54.850
among the statues of the famous
members of the Wizard Council.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.550
A statue?

07:56.580 --> 07:57.820
Really?

07:57.850 --> 07:59.820
I'd want to do something
a little more animated

07:59.850 --> 08:02.690
than these ones though.
I'm thinking this.

08:04.590 --> 08:06.620
Or, I got one of these, right here.

08:09.530 --> 08:13.360
Well, any of those would be extraordinary.

08:13.400 --> 08:17.570
Huh. I love the way he does
that "extraordinary."

08:17.600 --> 08:19.770
That's good. Yeah, yeah.

08:19.810 --> 08:23.640
Well, you may be extraordinary,

08:23.680 --> 08:26.540
but, of course, the proof
is in the pudding.

08:26.580 --> 08:29.450
Incidentally, after you take your test,

08:29.480 --> 08:30.650
you get pudding.

08:33.820 --> 08:36.490
Actually, I think
they're ready for the test.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.520
Why don't you just give it to them now?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.360
No, no, no.
They're actually not ready.

08:39.390 --> 08:40.390
We need more time.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.429
Justin, they know everything.

08:42.460 --> 08:43.690
The sooner they get back into WizTech,

08:43.730 --> 08:45.560
the sooner you get bk in the competition.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.400
Well, maybe, but are you just saying
that because you want pudding?

08:48.430 --> 08:51.340
Yes, I want pudding, I always want pudding,

08:51.370 --> 08:52.700
but no, seriously, they're ready.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.640
Stop it!
Stop it, stop it!

08:54.670 --> 08:57.410
With the "I want, I don't want"...

08:57.440 --> 08:59.580
Are you going to take the test, yes or no?

08:59.610 --> 09:02.380
I have pudding to make.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.350
Uh...

09:05.380 --> 09:08.590
Yes. Say yes.

09:08.620 --> 09:11.320
- Yes.
- Ah, good.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.690
Let's go before
Mr. Extraordinary here

09:13.730 --> 09:15.690
changes his mind.
Now, you four,

09:15.730 --> 09:17.530
sit in the chairs there.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.630
All right, and then, uh...
What we're going to do is,

09:19.670 --> 09:22.600
we're gonna take these
hairstyling machines,

09:22.630 --> 09:24.400
and then we're going to scan their brains,

09:24.440 --> 09:26.740
then we'll know what they know.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.510
I hope they're ready to take this test.

09:31.540 --> 09:32.710
Of course they're ready.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.380
Look, all the lights are blinking,

09:34.410 --> 09:36.780
that must mean they know a lot of stuff.

09:36.820 --> 09:38.620
Well, uh, uh...

09:38.650 --> 09:41.690
That completes our totally
unnecessary light show.

09:41.720 --> 09:45.490
So, uh, let's get on with the test.

09:47.790 --> 09:50.430
OK, so far we've got.

09:50.460 --> 09:53.500
Max's third grade citizenship award,

09:53.530 --> 09:55.670
his fifth grade Eskimo diorama,

09:55.700 --> 09:58.470
and a spelling test from second grade,

09:58.500 --> 10:01.340
where he spelled his name mostly right.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.410
Hey.

10:10.380 --> 10:11.680
What's going on?

10:11.720 --> 10:14.790
Uh... Max,
you're home early.

10:14.820 --> 10:18.490
We, uh... we can
explain everything.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.760
I hope so, Dad.

10:19.790 --> 10:21.690
'Cause if Harper's having
a fun arts and crafts class

10:21.730 --> 10:23.790
you should have invited me.

10:23.830 --> 10:26.700
Well, yeah, I mean...
Mr. and Mrs. Russo.

10:26.730 --> 10:30.640
I told you to invite Max.
You must've forgotten.

10:30.670 --> 10:34.440
Oh, that's right.
Oh, it's...

10:34.470 --> 10:37.780
But it's not too late for Max
to join us, is it, Harper?

10:37.810 --> 10:40.850
No, no. Not at all!
Come on, Max.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.410
Let's build an ice cream-stick
house together.

10:43.450 --> 10:45.450
Oh, you mean like I
used to do at summer camp?

10:45.480 --> 10:48.520
- Exactly!
- Yes!

10:48.550 --> 10:50.590
Did he go to summer camp?

10:50.620 --> 10:52.620
Oh. Must've been
that summer

10:52.660 --> 10:53.760
we thought he slept for a week.

10:57.900 --> 11:01.630
I'm thinking I need to take
a test every Saturday night.

11:01.670 --> 11:04.840
My hair's never had
so much volume and shine.

11:04.870 --> 11:07.510
Now I have a good place to keep my wand.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.480
I'm sorry I was so nervous
about you guys taking the test,

11:11.510 --> 11:12.610
but I think it went well.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.650
I feel good about it.
Or do I?

11:14.680 --> 11:17.820
- Yes, you do.
- Right.

11:17.850 --> 11:20.590
Ah, Professor Crumbs.

11:20.620 --> 11:24.560
There you are.
Lay the good news on us.

11:24.590 --> 11:27.390
The class failed miserably.

11:27.430 --> 11:28.560
Yay! Wait, what?

11:29.830 --> 11:31.700
Professor Crumbs, that's impossible.

11:31.730 --> 11:33.730
Are you sure?

11:33.770 --> 11:35.800
Wait, wait.
I reviewed with them.

11:35.830 --> 11:37.470
They knew everything.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.700
They couldn't have all failed.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.610
There has to be something wrong
with the brain scanners.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.470
Not possible.
Just look at their hair.

11:43.510 --> 11:47.380
Such great volume and shine.

11:47.410 --> 11:49.610
I knew they weren't ready.

11:49.650 --> 11:51.620
I'm sorry.

11:51.650 --> 11:54.790
The delinquents will not be
readmitted back to WizTech.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.760
And you are still ineligible

11:58.790 --> 12:01.390
for your family's wizard competition.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.460
It's a shame, Justin.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.530
You're not as extraordinary as I thought.

12:06.570 --> 12:09.430
Professor Crumbs!

12:09.470 --> 12:10.670
I'm so sorry, Justin.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.570
I really thought they were gonna pass.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.540
We're sorry, Mr. Justin.

12:14.570 --> 12:18.380
Don't apologize, Felix.

12:18.410 --> 12:20.680
I know what happened.

12:20.710 --> 12:24.550
Alex. You pushed the class
to be evaluated

12:24.580 --> 12:26.580
before they were ready so you could be sure

12:26.620 --> 12:28.790
that I wouldn't get back
into the wizard competition.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.590
What?

12:30.620 --> 12:33.390
You can't possibly be
blaming me for them failing.

12:33.430 --> 12:36.530
Would you cut the act?
You got what you wanted.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.460
No, this doesn't make any sense.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.730
I can understand if one or two failed,

12:40.770 --> 12:43.570
no offense back row.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.740
But everyone?

12:45.770 --> 12:49.370
What's it matter?
You ruined it, Alex.

12:49.410 --> 12:50.840
Just get outta here.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.810
Fine.

12:53.850 --> 12:56.610
But I'm gonna figure out what happened.

13:00.530 --> 13:01.600
Hello?

13:04.190 --> 13:05.800
Cragmont?

13:07.510 --> 13:09.510
Anybody there?

13:14.610 --> 13:15.810
I had to try.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.820
Hello?

13:24.620 --> 13:27.890
OK, if I were test results,
where would I be?

13:33.600 --> 13:35.600
Oh, wait, what am I doing?
There's no one here.

13:37.670 --> 13:39.640
OK, here it is.

13:39.670 --> 13:42.010
"Russo class test results."

13:43.940 --> 13:46.610
Oh, my gosh!
I knew it!

13:50.650 --> 13:51.950
<i>You've reached the wandmail</i>

13:51.980 --> 13:54.850
<i>of Justin Vincenzo</i>
<i>Pepe Russo!</i>

13:54.890 --> 13:57.550
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

13:58.620 --> 13:59.790
Justin, it's me.

13:59.820 --> 14:02.660
I found the delinquents' test results.

14:02.690 --> 14:03.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

14:04.000 --> 14:06.730
What are you doing with those, huh?!

14:06.770 --> 14:08.630
- Give me back my wand!
- Huh?

14:08.670 --> 14:10.670
What are you up to, Cragmont?

14:10.700 --> 14:13.500
This says that they passed
but you reported to Crumbs

14:13.540 --> 14:15.770
they failed. I think that
you've made a mistake.

14:15.810 --> 14:17.940
Mistake? Oh, no.
No, no, no, no. No.

14:17.980 --> 14:21.550
On purpose. Yes.

14:21.580 --> 14:22.950
The only mistake I made around here

14:22.980 --> 14:25.680
was waiting for that Professor Crumbs

14:25.720 --> 14:28.490
to make me a member of the Wizard Council.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.590
That's the only mistake.
Uh-huh.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.620
What does this have to do
with Justin's class?

14:32.660 --> 14:35.730
Justin. Oh. I'm tired of
hearing about Justin,

14:35.760 --> 14:41.530
and all those other
"extraordinary" young wizards.

14:41.570 --> 14:43.970
They're getting all the praise
from Professor Crumbs

14:44.000 --> 14:46.970
that should be going to me, me, me.

14:47.010 --> 14:49.940
Oh, I wish there were an echo in here.

14:49.970 --> 14:52.880
That would have been really
dramatic, wouldn't it?

14:52.910 --> 14:56.710
All right. That was a little kooky,
so I'm just gonna get outta here.

14:56.750 --> 14:59.880
H2 Russo!

15:02.020 --> 15:05.860
Hey, what are you doing?
Let me out of here.

15:05.890 --> 15:10.490
Never!

15:10.530 --> 15:13.600
Told you it would be more
dramatic with an echo, didn't I?

15:13.630 --> 15:15.700
Make a note of that.

15:20.910 --> 15:22.810
Thanks for helping us with all this.

15:22.840 --> 15:23.940
I think it's going pretty well.

15:23.980 --> 15:25.710
Yeah. Now we just
need him to believe

15:25.740 --> 15:28.480
he made all this stuff when he was a kid.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.750
Guys, check it out.
Hand turkey!

15:31.820 --> 15:35.520
Oh! Very good!

15:35.550 --> 15:37.960
Max, that looks exactly like the one

15:37.990 --> 15:39.660
you made in second grade.

15:39.690 --> 15:42.590
I know. Except my hand
was a little smaller.

15:43.730 --> 15:46.860
Um, actually, it wasn't.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.900
See, all the Russo boys

15:48.930 --> 15:50.800
were born with
full-size hands.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.840
Yeah. Some people are
born with big heads.

15:53.870 --> 15:57.570
But Russes are born with big hands.

15:57.610 --> 16:00.610
Really?

16:00.650 --> 16:02.610
Yes!
Your teachers,

16:02.650 --> 16:04.820
they used to call you
"Big Hand Max."

16:09.820 --> 16:12.560
Oh, right.
Now I remember.

16:12.590 --> 16:13.790
OK, Big Hand Max.

16:13.830 --> 16:16.830
Yeah, that's probably why I was
so good at peek-a-boo, huh?

16:16.860 --> 16:17.900
Peek-a-boo!

16:20.500 --> 16:21.800
Peek-a-boo!

16:21.830 --> 16:23.570
I got ya, I got ya!

16:25.940 --> 16:27.670
We're gonna be just fine.

16:27.710 --> 16:28.810
Yeah.

16:30.510 --> 16:32.710
We're sorry we let you down,
Mr. Justin.

16:32.740 --> 16:35.580
No, no, no.
I let you guys down.

16:35.610 --> 16:37.850
You're right.
You let us down.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.580
That's enough out of you, Nelvis.

16:42.620 --> 16:45.590
Wand message.

16:45.620 --> 16:46.920
It's from Alex.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.690
<i>Justin, it's me.</i>

16:48.730 --> 16:50.630
<i>I found the delinquents'</i>
<i>test results.</i>

16:50.660 --> 16:52.530
<i>What are you doing with those?!</i>

16:52.560 --> 16:54.730
Give me back my wand!

16:54.770 --> 16:56.700
That sounded like she was with Cragmont.

16:56.730 --> 16:58.670
I think she's in trouble.
We gotta help her.

16:58.700 --> 16:59.900
Whoa, wh, whoa!
Help her?

16:59.940 --> 17:02.810
Have you forgotten how
she let us down last time?

17:02.840 --> 17:06.540
Mr. Justin,
she is still your sister.

17:06.579 --> 17:09.609
And she's pretty and she talks to me.

17:09.650 --> 17:10.849
I don't care, I'm not helping her.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.480
Yes, you are.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.520
Felix!
Felix, put me down!

17:15.550 --> 17:18.560
You put me down, Felix!
Right now! That's an order!

17:19.690 --> 17:22.730
Felix!
Felix, put me down!

17:22.760 --> 17:24.599
Justin!

17:24.630 --> 17:25.900
Oh, there you are.

17:25.930 --> 17:28.569
Where? Where is she?
Turn me around.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.700
Alex! How did you
get in there?

17:30.740 --> 17:32.770
- Felix, put him down.
- Whoa.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.610
Cragmont put me in here when
I found the test results.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.440
All the delinquents passed!

17:38.610 --> 17:40.540
What?!

17:40.580 --> 17:43.850
She said they all passed.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.750
Then why did you tell Professor
Crumbs they all failed?

17:46.780 --> 17:49.820
Surprise!
I'm evil. Ha, ha!

17:49.850 --> 17:52.760
I may not look it, but boy,
you get me steamed

17:52.790 --> 17:55.630
I'm pretty evil.
Come on, come on.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.700
You need to let Alex out of there,

17:59.730 --> 18:02.830
and tell Professor Crumbs that
all of my delinquents passed.

18:02.870 --> 18:04.770
Or else.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.770
Or else what?

18:06.800 --> 18:09.570
People don't usually ask me that.

18:09.610 --> 18:10.740
Uh-huh.

18:10.780 --> 18:13.580
Well, Professor Crumbs said that one day

18:13.610 --> 18:15.750
you'd end up in the museum as a statue,

18:15.780 --> 18:18.580
and I guess today is that day.

18:18.620 --> 18:21.650
So, rock, rock 'till you drop.

18:24.820 --> 18:27.620
Guys, guys!
I can't move, help me!

18:27.660 --> 18:29.560
Let's stop the spell!

18:29.590 --> 18:31.700
That's gonna be difficult
without your wands.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.870
Justin's turning into stone!

18:37.670 --> 18:41.770
Well, who's next to join the
Hall of Wizards as a statue?

18:41.810 --> 18:43.870
Well, how about you, little fella?

18:43.910 --> 18:45.940
You'd look awfully good on my lawn.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.680
I still see you.

18:52.620 --> 18:54.650
Somebody do something!

18:56.000 --> 19:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:03.630 --> 19:07.430
Oh, boy.
This is not good.

19:07.470 --> 19:11.440
Felix, it's you.

19:11.470 --> 19:13.700
What are you waiting for?
Use that thing!

19:17.680 --> 19:19.910
- Felix, you did it!
- Nice wand work!

19:21.610 --> 19:24.820
Thunder has rung throughout
the Wizard World.

19:24.850 --> 19:28.450
Who removed the wand from the crystal ball?

19:28.490 --> 19:30.620
It was Felix.

19:30.660 --> 19:32.720
So...

19:32.760 --> 19:36.630
You're the long lost descendant
of the Great Wizard Renaldi.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.560
Check it out.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.530
Professor Crumbs bowed to me.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.570
This is so awesome!

19:44.840 --> 19:46.640
Oh, great.

19:46.670 --> 19:49.610
Another guy to call extraordinary.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.880
Oh, boy.

19:51.910 --> 19:54.480
Professor Crumbs, Cragmont lied

19:54.510 --> 19:56.480
about them failing their final evaluations.

19:56.510 --> 19:57.810
My class passed, Professor Crumbs.

19:57.850 --> 20:00.620
I see.
I was hoping Cragmont

20:00.650 --> 20:02.520
would rise above his resentment,

20:02.550 --> 20:04.520
but it seems it cannot be.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.890
Perhaps it's time for a change.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.790
Oh, come on.
For crying out loud, Crumbs.

20:09.830 --> 20:11.600
Lighten up a little bit, huh?

20:11.630 --> 20:13.560
Let's admit it, gang.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.500
We had a little bit
of fun here today, didn't we?

20:15.530 --> 20:17.770
Let's call it a day.
I'll see ya.

20:18.970 --> 20:19.900
Cragmont!

20:19.940 --> 20:22.570
You're not going anywhere.

20:22.610 --> 20:24.810
You're staying here
where you can be useful,

20:24.840 --> 20:26.940
as a wizard history book.

20:28.980 --> 20:31.650
Ouch!

20:31.680 --> 20:33.950
Congratulations, Justin Russo.

20:33.990 --> 20:37.820
You have successfully guided your
young group back to WizTech.

20:39.590 --> 20:41.730
Oh, man!
Thank you, Mr. Justin.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.830
I mean, you changed our lives forever.
Especially mine.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.800
I mean, now that I know I'm a Renaldi,

20:46.830 --> 20:48.730
I should have no trouble getting girls.

20:48.770 --> 20:50.630
Oh, Felix.

20:52.540 --> 20:54.970
And for your excellent teaching,
I am proud to announce

20:55.010 --> 20:58.810
that you are officially back in
your family wizard competition.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.680
Well, uh...
Thank you for the help.

21:04.720 --> 21:07.680
I probably couldn't have
gotten back in without you.

21:07.720 --> 21:10.450
Well, the competition wouldn't
be any fun without you.

21:10.490 --> 21:12.690
In that case, are you ready to lose?

21:12.720 --> 21:14.590
Oh, bring it on.

21:16.530 --> 21:18.760
I guess this is it,
Mr. Justin.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.930
How about we carry you out,
for old time's sake, huh?

21:20.970 --> 21:22.530
That does not sound fun in the slightest...

21:22.570 --> 21:24.630
- Whoa! Come on!
- Too late.

21:24.670 --> 21:26.470
Wizzy! Wizzy! Wizzy!

21:26.500 --> 21:27.770
Oy! Oy! Oy!

21:31.070 --> 21:33.770
Hey, kids.
Congratulations on all of you

21:33.770 --> 21:36.130
getting back into the wizard competition.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.630
We have gifts for you.

21:37.670 --> 21:39.170
We made scrapbooks

21:39.200 --> 21:42.180
to celebrate your childhood memories.

21:42.470 --> 21:44.410
Aww.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.640
Everything that you've
ever yelled at me about

21:46.680 --> 21:50.510
in one convenient book.
I'm so touched.

21:50.550 --> 21:51.850
Hey, look.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.820
It's a picture of me with poison ivy,

21:53.850 --> 21:58.560
and the online comments of all the
strangers who misdiagnosed me.

22:00.890 --> 22:04.730
Aww, I love this scrapbook of
all the things we did today.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.530
You knew?

22:08.570 --> 22:10.430
Well, since today was a complete waste,

22:10.470 --> 22:13.440
I'm just gonna take this cereal
necklace for my scrapbook.

22:14.670 --> 22:16.810
Max, you knew we were trying

22:16.840 --> 22:18.810
to recreate your memories from childhood?

22:18.840 --> 22:21.440
Well, I didn't know at first,

22:21.480 --> 22:23.580
but after you guys made up
that whole "Big Hand Max" story,

22:23.610 --> 22:26.620
it became pretty clear.

22:26.650 --> 22:28.490
I thought it was really nice of you guys.

22:28.520 --> 22:31.450
So, you're not mad that we didn't
save any of your memories?

22:31.490 --> 22:32.790
How could I be mad?

22:32.820 --> 22:35.530
I saved everything on the
top bunk of my bed. Look.

22:38.730 --> 22:40.430
You guys didn't know?

22:40.460 --> 22:44.730
I've got everything from my
first Little League trophy,

22:44.770 --> 22:47.600
to a collection of hair
from all my haircuts.

22:49.770 --> 22:51.780
Spaceship pinata filled with my baby teeth.

22:54.510 --> 22:57.580
Why in the world would you save that?

22:57.620 --> 22:59.720
Because, they're all my favorite memories.

22:59.750 --> 23:02.750
Why do you have a jar full of water

23:02.790 --> 23:04.750
with a carrot and coal?

23:04.790 --> 23:06.460
That's my first snowman.

23:06.490 --> 23:09.460
Now that is a good memory.

23:10.730 --> 23:11.760
Wow, Max.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.700
You're raising us to be
pretty good parents.
