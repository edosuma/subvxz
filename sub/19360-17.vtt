<i>This week on "Vice,"</i>

00:08.876 --> 00:12.177
<i>the functional breakdown
of our judicial system.</i>

00:13.781 --> 00:16.282
Unfortunately, you almost
have to pick and choose

00:16.317 --> 00:20.519
<i>some of the cases that you spend
the most amount of time on.</i>

00:20.555 --> 00:22.955
<i>Have any of you met
with your public defenders yet?</i>

00:22.990 --> 00:25.891
We've talked to you more than we've
talked to our lawyers in a year.

00:25.926 --> 00:28.326
<i>And then, the ongoing conflict</i>

00:28.362 --> 00:30.929
<i>over resources
in the jungles of Peru.</i>

00:32.266 --> 00:35.134
It looks like the battlefields
of World War I.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.534
It's brutal.

01:06.499 --> 01:09.366
The United States
incarcerates more people

01:09.402 --> 01:11.102
than any other country
in the world.

01:11.137 --> 01:14.205
<i>And a staggering 80%
of criminal defendants</i>

01:14.240 --> 01:17.040
<i>are represented by court-appointed
public defenders.</i>

01:17.075 --> 01:19.242
<i>Now, public defenders,
in many cases,</i>

01:19.278 --> 01:20.444
<i>are woefully overworked,</i>

01:20.479 --> 01:22.913
<i>not being able to get to see
their clients for months.</i>

01:22.948 --> 01:23.781
<i>In Louisiana,</i>

01:23.816 --> 01:26.116
a massive shortage
of public defenders

01:26.151 --> 01:28.285
is leaving many defendants
in jail

01:28.321 --> 01:30.086
with their cases in limbo.

01:30.122 --> 01:32.189
Missouri's
public defender's office

01:32.224 --> 01:34.724
<i>was already woefully
understaffed and underfunded.</i>

01:34.759 --> 01:36.993
So, we sent Cord Jefferson
to Missouri

01:37.029 --> 01:39.362
to see what affect
this breakdown is having

01:39.397 --> 01:40.831
on our judicial system.

01:53.911 --> 01:54.911
So this is the docket

01:54.946 --> 01:56.479
for the courtroom we're
about to go into.

01:56.514 --> 01:57.847
<i>It's well over a hundred cases,</i>

01:57.882 --> 02:01.417
<i>and this is just one docket
for one courtroom,</i>

02:01.453 --> 02:03.285
and there's 15 other
courtrooms in this building.

02:03.321 --> 02:07.122
<i>Eighty percent of these people are gonna
be represented by public defenders.</i>

02:08.792 --> 02:11.193
It's so crowded in here.

02:23.106 --> 02:25.206
Okay.

03:04.947 --> 03:07.114
Your Honor, I apologize.
We're not quite ready.

03:08.484 --> 03:10.884
<i>As public defenders
fail to process their cases,</i>

03:10.920 --> 03:12.986
<i>judges like Calvin Holden
are finding their courtrooms</i>

03:13.022 --> 03:14.521
<i>increasingly backlogged.</i>

03:14.556 --> 03:17.157
The system is slowly
grinding to a halt.

03:17.192 --> 03:18.892
When they don't have
enough attorneys

03:18.928 --> 03:21.995
and they don't have any staff,
really, to help them,

03:22.031 --> 03:23.931
they can't process cases.

03:23.966 --> 03:27.434
And when a large segment
of these cases every month

03:27.469 --> 03:29.436
have to be continued
to the next month,

03:29.471 --> 03:33.440
<i>and each time we do that it means
it delays it a little bit longer.</i>

03:33.475 --> 03:36.709
<i>And as more and more cases
keep coming in the system,</i>

03:36.745 --> 03:39.446
<i>that lag time just gets longer.</i>

03:39.481 --> 03:43.682
Our jail is more crowded now
than it ever has been.

03:43.717 --> 03:45.952
<i>We saw this firsthand
at Green County's jail,</i>

03:45.987 --> 03:48.988
<i>where the majority of prisoners we met
were waiting for their public defenders.</i>

03:49.023 --> 03:51.023
<i>Sometimes for months.</i>

03:51.059 --> 03:52.925
Are you all being represented
by public defenders?

03:52.961 --> 03:53.993
- Yes.
- Yup.

03:54.028 --> 03:56.095
Have any of you met with
your public defenders yet?

03:57.398 --> 03:59.765
And you still haven't
met with your public defender?

03:59.800 --> 04:00.799
You've been here three months?

04:00.835 --> 04:03.735
And you haven't met
your public defender yet?

04:06.807 --> 04:07.973
Really?

04:11.679 --> 04:13.178
Yeah.

04:14.281 --> 04:15.647
Yeah.

04:32.732 --> 04:34.732
How long have you been here
in jail?

04:34.767 --> 04:35.967
Fourteen months?

04:36.002 --> 04:38.068
<i>The prisoners
who can't afford a lawyer</i>

04:38.104 --> 04:39.670
<i>usually can't afford bail
either.</i>

04:39.706 --> 04:41.506
<i>And as they wait indefinitely
for their trials,</i>

04:41.541 --> 04:43.307
<i>the jail house is filling up.</i>

04:43.342 --> 04:45.643
This unit was built to house 42,

04:45.678 --> 04:47.277
and there are 67 in here today.

04:47.313 --> 04:49.846
So obviously we have to
load up some of the cells

04:49.882 --> 04:51.415
- with more than two people.
- Mm-hmm.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.417
And we have what we call boats.

04:53.452 --> 04:56.720
And they're just basically
plastic-type mattresses,

04:56.755 --> 04:58.989
and somebody
has to sleep on the floor.

04:59.025 --> 05:01.825
There's four people in my two-man cell.
There's two of us on the floor.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.627
Two of you are in the boats?
We saw one of the boats.

05:03.662 --> 05:07.463
No, we're on the floor. There's too many...
there's... we can't fit any boats in there.

05:07.499 --> 05:09.132
Oh, wow.

05:09.167 --> 05:10.911
They don't even have
the boats that we saw,

05:11.031 --> 05:12.930
because the boats wouldn't fit in here,

05:17.150 --> 05:18.975
<i>In addition to what we have here,</i>

05:19.011 --> 05:20.677
<i>we also got 115 inmates</i>

05:20.712 --> 05:24.447
housed in other counties outside the facility
because we don't have the beds for 'em.

05:24.482 --> 05:26.082
The county will pay
a million dollars,

05:26.117 --> 05:28.518
probably slightly over
a million dollars this year

05:28.553 --> 05:31.054
in out-of-house...
out-of-county housing costs.

05:31.089 --> 05:33.689
You can probably get a lot of public
defenders with a million dollars.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.091
Probably so.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.026
<i>Eighty percent
of all criminal defendants</i>

05:37.062 --> 05:38.294
<i>need public defenders.</i>

05:38.329 --> 05:42.364
<i>Despite this, of the $265
billion we spend each year</i>

05:42.399 --> 05:44.199
<i>on our criminal justice system,</i>

05:44.234 --> 05:47.069
<i>we spend less than 2% of that
on public defense.</i>

05:47.104 --> 05:49.538
<i>This leaves court-appointed
lawyers like Bryan Delleville</i>

05:49.574 --> 05:52.340
<i>completely overwhelmed
by their caseloads.</i>

05:54.244 --> 05:57.011
Good morning, Your Honor. Mr. McManus
is here in custody behind me.

06:00.417 --> 06:03.452
There's 25 cases
that Brian's hearing.

06:03.487 --> 06:05.620
Can I get just a...
a little bit more time?

06:05.655 --> 06:08.457
I mean, you can see the stacks
on Bryan's desk right now.

06:08.492 --> 06:10.825
All the blue folders.

06:10.860 --> 06:12.794
She takes care of her mom.
She also works...

06:12.829 --> 06:14.796
I believe, it's two jobs. So,
she's trying to save the money

06:14.831 --> 06:18.099
so that she can get her license back.
So, if we could get November.

06:18.134 --> 06:20.001
Uh, November 2nd.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.406
And then we'll also
set the case for a trial.

06:25.441 --> 06:27.241
Bryan's now been
here for, like, an hour.

06:27.276 --> 06:30.043
And this is, I think, the 10th
client we've seen him with.

06:30.079 --> 06:32.480
Yeah. You're good to go.

06:32.515 --> 06:36.484
It's crazy how quickly
he moves through these people.

06:40.623 --> 06:43.090
I think he's meeting with
some of them for the first time.

06:43.126 --> 06:44.725
Next week, okay?

06:44.760 --> 06:46.600
I think the craziest
thing is that every client

06:46.629 --> 06:49.663
thinks that their case is the most
important one in the world to him,

06:49.698 --> 06:51.464
and he has to treat it that way.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.532
<i>Which can be challenging,</i>

06:52.567 --> 06:55.168
<i>especially with clients
who have mental health issues.</i>

06:56.005 --> 06:58.071
<i>He was indicating to me</i>

06:58.107 --> 07:00.774
that he believed
he was able to proceed.

07:00.809 --> 07:02.108
- Mentally competent. Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:02.144 --> 07:05.778
And I said, "I just need a doctor
to come in and evaluate you

07:05.813 --> 07:09.315
and make sure, because you're facing
up to seven years in prison."

07:09.351 --> 07:10.783
- Mm-hmm.
- "That you're...

07:10.818 --> 07:12.685
"that we're all on board here
and that we're good to go."

07:12.720 --> 07:14.920
Because you need to do your due diligence.
Right. Right.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.990
- Okay?
- Okay.

07:18.026 --> 07:19.625
I'm going to be seeking

07:19.661 --> 07:21.560
a mental health
court screening for him.

07:21.595 --> 07:24.563
I think at this point I have
some concerns as to proceeding,

07:24.598 --> 07:27.833
so if I could just maybe
get a reappearance next week.

07:27.869 --> 07:30.002
Okay. Let's do that.

07:32.740 --> 07:35.106
So, I'm trying to get a doctor
in there as soon as possible.

07:35.142 --> 07:37.709
And what if a doctor says
he's not good to proceed?

07:37.744 --> 07:39.878
Well, we can't...
we can't proceed if...

07:53.660 --> 07:55.794
You went through 25 clients

07:55.829 --> 07:57.762
in about two hours.

07:57.798 --> 07:58.897
Mm-hmm.

07:58.932 --> 08:00.799
Is that enough time, really?

08:03.503 --> 08:05.336
No.

08:05.371 --> 08:08.038
In a perfect world, it would
be best if, you know,

08:08.074 --> 08:10.341
I had enough time
to meet with each of them

08:10.376 --> 08:12.009
well in advance of this hearing,

08:12.044 --> 08:15.313
rather than, those who are out of custody,
a lot of times this is their appointment.

08:15.348 --> 08:17.915
Unfortunately, you almost
have to pick and choose

08:17.950 --> 08:20.618
some of the cases that you spend
the most amount of time on.

08:20.653 --> 08:23.454
I'd love to be able to do that
on every single case.

08:23.489 --> 08:25.222
- Yeah.
- I mean, I don't want to be somebody

08:25.257 --> 08:27.691
that's just
standing next to somebody.

08:27.727 --> 08:29.960
<i>What makes this
so hard to accomplish</i>

08:29.995 --> 08:32.929
<i>is that while Missouri's crime rate is
amongst the highest in the country,</i>

08:32.965 --> 08:35.099
<i>it actually ranks 49th
out of 50 states</i>

08:35.134 --> 08:38.969
<i>in terms of per capita funding
for public defenders.</i>

08:39.004 --> 08:41.104
This is my
penthouse office here.

08:41.139 --> 08:43.106
It's huge.

08:43.140 --> 08:47.176
Um, most of these files on my desk
are from last Tuesday and Wednesday

08:47.212 --> 08:49.246
that I still
have to process through.

08:49.281 --> 08:52.382
So, this is... basically, we're looking
at your caseload here a little bit.

08:52.417 --> 08:55.118
Yeah, plus... that...

08:56.288 --> 08:58.121
that...

08:58.156 --> 08:59.355
and that...

09:00.258 --> 09:02.558
and those, and in here.

09:02.593 --> 09:04.460
Do you even know
how many it is right now?

09:04.495 --> 09:07.163
Um, I think it's...

09:07.198 --> 09:08.631
about 200 or so.

09:08.666 --> 09:10.199
<i>Making matters worse,</i>

09:10.235 --> 09:13.535
<i>the public defenders in this office
make an average $12,000 less</i>

09:13.571 --> 09:15.638
<i>than the prosecutors
in the same county,</i>

09:15.673 --> 09:18.674
<i>despite having to handle
record caseloads.</i>

09:18.709 --> 09:20.909
Well, let's go
ahead and get started.

09:20.944 --> 09:22.584
First of all, I wanted
to let you guys know

09:22.613 --> 09:23.679
about some things,

09:23.714 --> 09:25.414
some developments we've
had in Greene County,

09:25.449 --> 09:28.083
as far as our caseload issues.

09:28.118 --> 09:30.285
I had mentioned to Judge Holden

09:30.320 --> 09:32.654
about kind of
where our numbers were at,

09:32.689 --> 09:35.623
and everybody
was somewhere between

09:35.659 --> 09:38.927
400 to 600% of capacity.

09:38.962 --> 09:41.096
So that's where
we're at with that.

09:41.131 --> 09:45.633
Um, also mention that today
is Dan's last day.

09:47.069 --> 09:49.304
Uh, but it is Patty's first day,

09:49.339 --> 09:52.607
so welcome, Patty.

09:52.642 --> 09:55.242
Come Monday, assuming nobody
quits between now and then,

09:55.278 --> 09:57.912
it will be the first time
in 2016 we'll be fully staffed,

09:57.947 --> 10:01.582
so everybody keep your fingers
crossed on that one, so.

10:01.618 --> 10:03.550
<i>Daniel Coulter
went to law school</i>

10:03.585 --> 10:05.152
<i>specifically to become
a public defender.</i>

10:05.188 --> 10:09.056
<i>But after only three years, he's
leaving to go into private practice.</i>

10:09.091 --> 10:10.524
Did you ever envision
that this day would come,

10:10.559 --> 10:13.460
or were you confident you were gonna be
a public defender your entire career?

10:13.495 --> 10:16.797
I didn't have any plans after the
public defender's office Yeah.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.599
When I left law school,
or when I started this job.

10:19.635 --> 10:21.134
And now you're leaving
after three years.

10:21.169 --> 10:22.902
Yeah.
It's-it's-it's, uh...

10:22.938 --> 10:25.071
it's a little bit defeating,
in a way.

10:25.106 --> 10:27.140
Like I said,
I wanted to be a PD.

10:27.175 --> 10:31.211
- Yeah.
- And then it just didn't turn out to be

10:31.246 --> 10:32.646
everything I'd hoped.

10:32.681 --> 10:34.748
So, if you had the caseload
that you have now

10:34.783 --> 10:37.116
but you made more money,
would that have kept you around?

10:37.152 --> 10:39.452
Possibly. And if you
made the amount of money

10:39.487 --> 10:41.387
you make right now
but had fewer cases?

10:41.422 --> 10:43.489
- That would help as well. Yeah.
- Yeah?

10:43.524 --> 10:46.659
<i>As we focus more
and more on criminal justice,</i>

10:46.694 --> 10:49.395
<i>from policing
to overcrowding in prisons,</i>

10:49.430 --> 10:53.733
<i>the constitutional right to an
adequate defense is often overlooked.</i>

10:53.768 --> 10:55.200
<i>Ezekiel Edwards is the director</i>

10:55.236 --> 10:57.570
<i>of the ACLU's Criminal Law
Reform Project.</i>

10:57.605 --> 11:01.139
<i>He broke down why the proper funding
of public defense is so important.</i>

11:01.175 --> 11:04.343
What are some of the real
consequences that we're facing

11:04.379 --> 11:07.580
because of the fact that public
defense is in shambles, as you say?

11:07.615 --> 11:10.582
We know that if you had lawyers
at your first appearance,

11:10.617 --> 11:13.718
if you had lawyers
at your bail hearings

11:13.754 --> 11:15.888
who were well-funded
and well-resourced,

11:15.923 --> 11:18.823
we would have far fewer people
detained pretrial.

11:18.859 --> 11:20.993
Without a meaningful
indigent defense system,

11:21.028 --> 11:22.127
you have what we have today,

11:22.162 --> 11:24.696
<i>which is over two million
people incarcerated</i>

11:24.731 --> 11:27.098
<i>and the highest incarceration
rate in the world.</i>

11:27.133 --> 11:29.701
<i>Expenditure on indigent
defense in the United States</i>

11:29.736 --> 11:33.137
<i>is a very small fraction of our
criminal justice spending as a whole.</i>

11:33.172 --> 11:34.806
Why is there such
a discrepancy here?

11:34.841 --> 11:37.008
Well, the lack of indigent
defense funding

11:37.043 --> 11:38.643
is a major problem.

11:38.678 --> 11:42.914
<i>States don't give more than 2%
of their budgets, nationwide,</i>

11:42.949 --> 11:44.248
<i>to indigent defense funding.</i>

11:44.284 --> 11:47.551
<i>And this results in what we
have today, which is a crisis</i>

11:47.586 --> 11:49.620
<i>where we don't have lawyers
in many courtrooms</i>

11:49.655 --> 11:51.688
or the lawyers
that are in those courtrooms

11:51.724 --> 11:54.325
are swimming under
way too many cases

11:54.360 --> 11:56.994
and are unable to provide
effective representation.

11:57.030 --> 11:58.762
Is there any
indigent defense office

11:58.798 --> 12:00.564
that's doing it right,
in your eyes?

12:00.599 --> 12:02.766
There are places like
the Bronx Defenders.

12:02.802 --> 12:05.969
<i>The Bronx Defenders
serves the South Bronx,</i>

12:06.004 --> 12:08.405
<i>the country's poorest
congressional district.</i>

12:08.441 --> 12:11.341
<i>The office combines government
money with their own fundraising,</i>

12:11.376 --> 12:14.711
<i>which allows them to hire specialized
lawyers who work together in teams</i>

12:14.747 --> 12:18.514
<i>to provide their clients
with the best possible defense.</i>

12:18.550 --> 12:21.617
So, I want to introduce you
to Kevin Farley.

12:21.653 --> 12:24.520
He is a housing attorney
and civil attorney

12:24.556 --> 12:28.191
who works with me
in my office, on my team.

12:28.226 --> 12:29.359
Call to confirm...

12:29.394 --> 12:30.760
<i>When a client first
meets their attorney,</i>

12:30.795 --> 12:34.096
they may not know immediately that
actually what they're getting

12:34.131 --> 12:36.065
is not just an attorney,
they're getting an entire team.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.935
<i>And that team will have
embedded in it</i>

12:38.970 --> 12:41.036
<i>immigration attorneys,
housing attorneys,</i>

12:41.072 --> 12:42.972
<i>family court attorneys,
social workers,</i>

12:43.007 --> 12:45.441
<i>community organizers,
investigators...</i>

12:45.477 --> 12:49.511
an entire interdisciplinary
approach to the criminal arrest.

12:49.546 --> 12:51.447
And you contacted the police.

12:51.482 --> 12:54.883
In addition to everything else,

12:54.918 --> 12:57.186
I would like you to meet
your new lawyer.

12:57.221 --> 13:00.322
We try all of our cases
with two lawyers.

13:00.358 --> 13:01.656
All of them.

13:01.692 --> 13:03.692
But you're going to stay
with me?

13:03.727 --> 13:06.394
Absolutely. I'll be the lead
lawyer on your case. Always.

13:06.429 --> 13:09.297
I'm not going anywhere.
Okay. Thank you.

13:09.332 --> 13:10.999
It's funny that what
we're seeing here is almost

13:11.034 --> 13:13.034
exactly the opposite
of what we saw in Missouri.

13:13.069 --> 13:16.505
<i>Whereas that was one public defender
surrounded by, like, six different clients,</i>

13:16.540 --> 13:20.074
this is one client surrounded by three
different public defenders on this case.

13:20.110 --> 13:22.843
- Thank you very much.
- All right. All right. Take care.

13:22.879 --> 13:25.179
<i>The argument for
programs like the Bronx Defenders</i>

13:25.215 --> 13:27.081
<i>is that investing in quality
public defense</i>

13:27.117 --> 13:29.317
<i>ends up saving money
in the long run.</i>

13:29.352 --> 13:31.019
<i>If you want to look at it</i>

13:31.054 --> 13:32.654
<i>from the dollars and cents
point of view,</i>

13:32.688 --> 13:35.956
addressing all the issues that clients are
facing in the criminal justice system

13:35.992 --> 13:38.325
ultimately will save
taxpayers and governments

13:38.360 --> 13:39.827
enormous amounts of money.

13:39.862 --> 13:42.362
<i>You'll see it in pretrial
detention reduction.</i>

13:42.398 --> 13:43.564
<i>You'll see it in the
reduction of jail time.</i>

13:43.599 --> 13:45.232
<i>You'll see it in the
reduction of prison time.</i>

13:45.267 --> 13:48.769
<i>So, it's very shortsighted to think that
if we don't get involved at the beginning</i>

13:48.804 --> 13:51.371
that somehow that's gonna wind
up saving taxpayer dollars.

13:51.407 --> 13:53.247
It's gonna wind up costing
everybody more money.

13:53.275 --> 13:55.308
But at the end of the day,
there is value

13:55.344 --> 13:59.312
in being that person that stands
next to the individual and fights

13:59.348 --> 14:01.214
every single day,
in every way you can,

14:01.250 --> 14:03.583
um, to prevent the system
from running them over.

14:06.821 --> 14:09.256
All over the world,
natural resources

14:09.291 --> 14:12.324
are being extracted
at an astonishing pace.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.393
<i>As a result,
developing countries</i>

14:14.429 --> 14:17.363
often face what is known
as a resource curse,

14:17.398 --> 14:19.432
where an influx of foreign money

14:19.467 --> 14:22.035
<i>creates an increased risk
of government corruption,</i>

14:22.070 --> 14:24.704
<i>exploitation, and civil war.</i>

14:24.739 --> 14:28.174
Now, this fight over resources
is now raging in Peru,

14:28.209 --> 14:30.342
so we sent Ben Anderson
to the Amazon

14:30.378 --> 14:32.844
to see what's happening
on the ground there.

14:44.725 --> 14:47.960
So, it's about midnight.
It's freezing cold.

14:47.995 --> 14:50.862
And something like
1,800 policemen and soldiers

14:50.898 --> 14:52.530
are gathering
for a major operation

14:52.566 --> 14:56.034
against illegal miners here
in a town called Rinconada.

15:08.848 --> 15:10.648
<i>At sunrise the next day,</i>

15:10.683 --> 15:12.584
<i>the police arrived
at Pampa Blanca,</i>

15:12.619 --> 15:15.987
<i>15,000 feet above sea level,</i>

15:16.022 --> 15:17.922
<i>where the government says
illegal gold miners</i>

15:17.957 --> 15:20.557
<i>are causing huge damage
to the local environment.</i>

15:28.835 --> 15:31.235
<i>We watched as policemen
laid explosives</i>

15:31.270 --> 15:34.404
<i>to destroy every makeshift
mining platform they could find.</i>

15:39.245 --> 15:42.045
We're about
25 meters away from...

15:50.756 --> 15:53.556
This one here is the next one
that's gonna get blown up.

15:56.161 --> 15:59.295
<i>But while the destruction of these
mines may be good for the environment,</i>

15:59.330 --> 16:02.065
<i>it was clear that this operation
would destroy the livelihoods</i>

16:02.100 --> 16:04.134
<i>of people at the very bottom
of the food chain.</i>

16:11.042 --> 16:13.442
It's 50 villagers, maybe,

16:13.478 --> 16:18.881
versus 600,
800 heavily-armed policemen.

16:39.369 --> 16:40.809
<i>The official
stance of the government</i>

16:40.837 --> 16:45.073
<i>is that these operations are
strictly to protect the environment.</i>

16:45.108 --> 16:47.576
<i>Taskforce Chief
Antonio Fernandez Jeri</i>

16:47.611 --> 16:50.144
<i>explained the cost
of illegal mining.</i>

17:24.880 --> 17:27.348
We were told
that if you pay a bribe,

17:27.383 --> 17:29.583
you can get a permit and
continue your mining unharassed.

17:29.618 --> 17:30.683
Is that true?

17:36.324 --> 17:39.325
<i>But there are people who claim
that when there are profits to be made,</i>

17:39.361 --> 17:41.628
<i>the government has shown
itself to be perfectly willing</i>

17:41.663 --> 17:44.397
<i>to abandon the country's
precious natural reserves.</i>

17:44.432 --> 17:47.199
<i>Anthropologist Jesus Castro
used to work for those</i>

17:47.235 --> 17:50.102
<i>oil and gas companies
operating within Peru.</i>

18:11.859 --> 18:14.026
<i>What we were
hearing was contradictory.</i>

18:14.061 --> 18:16.228
<i>While the state says
it wants to protect the land</i>

18:16.264 --> 18:17.797
<i>and the people that live on it,</i>

18:17.832 --> 18:21.132
<i>selling off the resources beneath it
to multinational energy companies</i>

18:21.168 --> 18:24.002
<i>often results
in mass deforestation.</i>

18:24.037 --> 18:25.804
<i>To see the side effects
of such deals,</i>

18:25.839 --> 18:28.206
<i>we went to the edge
of Peru's Amazon region.</i>

18:55.835 --> 19:00.371
Even now we can hear machines.
Where is that sound coming from?

19:23.162 --> 19:27.397
<i>As we drove on,
devastation spread for miles.</i>

19:27.432 --> 19:31.934
Look at this. Just no trees left.
Polluted water.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.904
It looks like the battlefields
of World War I.

19:34.939 --> 19:37.173
It's brutal.

19:37.208 --> 19:40.343
<i>Peru is the top gold-producing
country in Latin America,</i>

19:40.379 --> 19:43.412
<i>and the destruction has been going
on for the last two decades.</i>

19:44.415 --> 19:46.949
<i>All of this was once
pristine rainforest.</i>

19:48.186 --> 19:50.419
And this used to be a source
of real value,

19:50.454 --> 19:53.422
not just for the people who live
here, but for the whole planet.

19:53.457 --> 19:55.858
And now it's a source of poison.

19:55.894 --> 20:01.296
<i>As demand for gold rises, the mines
continue to eat away at the rainforest.</i>

20:01.331 --> 20:04.900
<i>But another potentially larger
threat looms on the horizon.</i>

20:06.837 --> 20:10.338
<i>Several companies have reason to
believe there's natural gas here.</i>

20:10.374 --> 20:13.575
<i>They've signed a deal with the
Peruvian government to extract it.</i>

20:13.611 --> 20:16.311
<i>Jesus saw what damage
was being done</i>

20:16.346 --> 20:17.979
<i>and what further damage
would be done</i>

20:18.015 --> 20:19.747
<i>if the project went ahead.</i>

20:19.783 --> 20:22.384
<i>When his work was ignored,
he spoke out.</i>

20:42.038 --> 20:44.004
<i>Hunt oil
has a devastating history</i>

20:44.040 --> 20:45.973
<i>of working in the Amazon.</i>

20:46.008 --> 20:48.042
<i>They were part of a
consortium of companies</i>

20:48.077 --> 20:49.776
<i>that managed
the Camisea Gas Project,</i>

20:49.812 --> 20:53.513
<i>which was responsible for one of
the major disasters in the Amazon.</i>

20:53.549 --> 20:56.650
<i>The project caused five leaks
in just 18 months,</i>

20:56.685 --> 20:58.419
<i>and contact with those
working on it</i>

20:58.454 --> 21:01.322
<i>caused the spread of epidemics
and chronic diseases.</i>

21:09.531 --> 21:11.965
<i>Jesus shared documents
detailing just how extensive</i>

21:12.000 --> 21:14.801
<i>Hunt's exploration
of Lot 76 has been.</i>

21:19.274 --> 21:21.975
And there's 166 heliports?

21:23.311 --> 21:25.345
<i>Hunt's concession
also allows them to search</i>

21:25.380 --> 21:27.913
<i>for natural gas
by setting off explosives</i>

21:27.949 --> 21:29.849
<i>which send seismic waves
into the ground</i>

21:29.884 --> 21:32.151
<i>to create a map
of drilling hot spots.</i>

21:41.228 --> 21:43.863
<i>In order to get this deal, Hunt
had to conduct an assessment</i>

21:43.898 --> 21:46.398
<i>about what impact
their work would have.</i>

21:47.635 --> 21:49.702
So, this one is saying,
<i>"inexistencia."</i>

21:49.737 --> 21:51.436
There's nothing of historical

21:51.472 --> 21:54.206
or cultural significance
in this area.

21:55.342 --> 21:57.376
<i>So, according
to the government itself,</i>

21:57.411 --> 22:00.178
<i>anything of historical</i>
<i>significance was</i> inexistencia,

22:00.214 --> 22:02.381
<i>or nonexistent in Lot 76.</i>

22:03.283 --> 22:04.649
<i>If this could be proved wrong,</i>

22:04.684 --> 22:06.851
<i>the companies
could be forced out.</i>

22:06.887 --> 22:08.786
<i>We traveled deep
into the heart of the jungle</i>

22:08.822 --> 22:10.454
<i>to find Lot 76 ourselves.</i>

22:15.595 --> 22:17.361
<i>There we met the Harakmbut,</i>

22:17.397 --> 22:19.564
<i>a local tribe that has been
mapping their territory</i>

22:19.599 --> 22:21.833
<i>and collecting evidence
of cultural artifacts</i>

22:21.868 --> 22:25.503
<i>in a last-ditch effort
to save their land.</i>

22:25.539 --> 22:27.204
<i>We joined them
on a six-day journey</i>

22:27.240 --> 22:30.374
<i>to find something they say has
huge cultural significance...</i>

22:30.410 --> 22:33.710
<i>a rock formation resembling
a face they call El Rostro,</i>

22:33.746 --> 22:37.614
<i>one of three artifacts that will
form the basis of their claim</i>

22:37.650 --> 22:39.450
<i>that the land
should remain protected.</i>

22:39.485 --> 22:41.519
Why are you against Hunt
coming here

22:41.554 --> 22:43.954
and having operations
throughout the area?

23:16.153 --> 23:18.754
<i>Midway, the Harakmbut
carried out a body painting ritual</i>

23:18.790 --> 23:21.891
<i>that they believe guarantees the
protection of their ancestors.</i>

23:44.748 --> 23:46.748
He said that...

23:46.783 --> 23:49.023
when I wake up in the morning,
I'll be a transformed man,

23:49.052 --> 23:52.621
I'll be a Harakmbut.
I'll be one of them.

23:59.963 --> 24:02.330
<i>The following morning,
we continued on,</i>

24:02.365 --> 24:04.899
<i>crossing rivers,
hiking steep mountainsides,</i>

24:04.935 --> 24:06.967
<i>and constantly having to push
the boat upstream</i>

24:07.003 --> 24:08.869
<i>when the river was too shallow.</i>

24:13.876 --> 24:19.046
The entire journey, the river's
been this deep, maximum.

24:19.081 --> 24:22.382
So we're always having to stop
and drag the boat through.

24:51.780 --> 24:53.746
<i>They spotted
a couple of monkeys,</i>

24:53.782 --> 24:56.248
<i>at once common,
but now a rare sight.</i>

25:01.790 --> 25:04.423
<i>They say the operations
that have already started in the area</i>

25:04.458 --> 25:06.225
<i>have made wildlife scarce.</i>

25:14.702 --> 25:17.803
<i>Lucho has stopped to make
updates of the map he'd been drafting.</i>

25:27.014 --> 25:29.915
The map is covered
with things that are significant

25:29.950 --> 25:31.883
to the people who live here,

25:31.919 --> 25:35.286
and it's supposed to be an area
where nothing exists.

25:45.632 --> 25:47.599
So, I think...

25:47.634 --> 25:49.166
the fact that we're
back at the river again

25:49.202 --> 25:51.402
means there's just
one more peak to go over.

25:51.438 --> 25:53.338
And then we're there.

25:59.946 --> 26:02.046
<i>Before crossing that last peak,</i>

26:02.081 --> 26:04.215
<i>the Harakmbut conducted
a tobacco ceremony</i>

26:04.250 --> 26:07.417
<i>they believe allayed their
fears and negative thoughts.</i>

26:43.789 --> 26:46.122
<i>The Harakmbut believe
that the face in the rock</i>

26:46.158 --> 26:48.958
<i>was carved by a god
from ancient mythology.</i>

27:29.165 --> 27:32.266
What do you hope that
discovering this could mean?

27:42.578 --> 27:44.078
<i>In the time since we've filmed,</i>

27:44.113 --> 27:47.514
<i>Hunt has suspended exploratory
drilling in Lot 76,</i>

27:47.550 --> 27:49.183
<i>a huge relief for the Harakmbut.</i>

27:49.219 --> 27:53.821
<i>But the Peruvian government extended the
company's rights to the area for three years.</i>

27:53.857 --> 27:56.324
<i>When contacted,
Hunt declined to comment</i>

27:56.359 --> 27:58.625
<i>on their operations
in the Peruvian Amazon.</i>
