00:57.474 --> 01:01.061
<i>I saw </i>48 Hrs.
<i>at a local multiplex in December, 1982,</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:02.312
<i>when I was nine years old.</i>

01:03.063 --> 01:06.691
<i>My parents dropped me and a buddy off,</i>
<i>and as was the custom,</i>

01:06.775 --> 01:09.319
<i>we snuck into it</i>
<i>after buying tickets for something else.</i>

01:10.153 --> 01:13.698
<i>It was the talk of the third grade,</i>
<i>and seeing it was a rite of passage.</i>

01:15.408 --> 01:18.787
48 Hrs. <i>was developed</i>
<i>at Michael Eisner's Paramount Pictures,</i>

01:18.870 --> 01:21.539
<i>hardly the gold standard</i>
<i>for socially challenging fare.</i>

01:22.290 --> 01:24.334
<i>It was meant to be</i>
<i>a conventional action comedy</i>

01:24.417 --> 01:27.212
<i>and expedient bit</i>
<i>of holiday counter-programming.</i>

01:27.587 --> 01:30.131
<i>But somehow,</i>
<i>director Walter Hill's film</i>

01:30.215 --> 01:34.010
<i>landed in theaters as this edgy,</i>
<i>even dangerous, conversation</i>

01:34.094 --> 01:36.554
<i>about race and identity in America.</i>

01:36.638 --> 01:39.057
<i>It was a conversation I was ready for.</i>

01:39.557 --> 01:41.643
<i>A conversation about us.</i>

01:41.726 --> 01:44.145
<i>A conversation about you and me.</i>

01:45.063 --> 01:46.731
<i>It was the best movie I'd ever seen.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:47.774
Police. Open up.

01:47.857 --> 01:51.569
<i>An entry into a forbidden world</i>
<i>of the profane and the violent,</i>

01:51.653 --> 01:53.780
<i>and I didn't understand</i>
<i>even a little bit of it.</i>

01:54.405 --> 01:55.657
<i>But I knew Reggie.</i>

01:56.032 --> 01:58.284
<i>I recognized the defense mechanisms</i>
<i>he'd developed</i>

01:58.368 --> 02:01.079
<i>in coping with the racism</i>
<i>of his day-to-day</i>

02:01.162 --> 02:02.956
<i>as ones I was beginning to develop.</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:07.127
<i>And as the only Chinese kid</i>
<i>in an all-white area of Colorado…</i>

02:07.877 --> 02:09.295
<i>I knew guys like Jack too.</i>

02:10.588 --> 02:13.842
You are real stupid for a cop, man.
You're following this guy too close.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.385
Well, most cops are pretty stupid,

02:15.468 --> 02:17.887
but since you landed in jail,
what the hell does that make you?

02:18.555 --> 02:20.265

48 Hrs. <i>is considered the headwaters</i>

02:20.348 --> 02:22.559
<i>for the wave of interracial buddy films</i>

02:22.642 --> 02:25.019
<i>that exploded throughout the '80s and '90s</i>

02:25.103 --> 02:27.105
<i>and continue to grab</i>
<i>big box office numbers today.</i>

02:27.188 --> 02:28.731
Would you stop that?

02:28.815 --> 02:32.110
<i>Essentially staking out this ground</i>
<i>as its own sub-genre.</i>

02:32.193 --> 02:33.027

S<i>ure that's him?</i>

02:33.111 --> 02:34.571
Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.826
<i>And it was also the flash point</i>
<i>for Eddie Murphy's superstardom.</i>

02:39.909 --> 02:41.161
My name's Reggie Hammond.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.996
<i>The film was his big screen debut,</i>

02:43.079 --> 02:46.457
<i>and after this, Murphy would never</i>
<i>be second billed again.</i>

02:46.541 --> 02:50.170
I believe in the merit system. So far,
you ain't built up no points, boy.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.173
Oh, well, then I'll be real good
from now on, Mr. Cates.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.842
<i>But what </i>48 Hrs. <i>is not often seen as,</i>

02:55.925 --> 02:57.635
<i>and it should be, is a landmark.</i>

02:58.219 --> 02:59.971
<i>A challenging, even at times progressive</i>

03:00.054 --> 03:02.932
<i>treatise on race relations</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

03:03.016 --> 03:04.267
Come on, boy, hit it now.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.894
Boy, hey?
-Yeah, hit it.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.229

<i>There are obvious antecedents for </i>48 Hrs.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.900
<i>Sidney Poitier's </i>The Defiant Ones <i>and</i>
In the Heat of the Night <i>on the one side…</i>

03:11.983 --> 03:14.569
Virgil's a funny name for a nigger boy
from Philadelphia.

03:14.652 --> 03:15.987
What do they call you there?

03:16.070 --> 03:18.907
They call me Mr. Tibbs.

03:18.990 --> 03:23.786
<i>…Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder's</i>
Silver Streak <i>and </i>Stir Crazy <i>on the other.</i>

03:23.870 --> 03:27.040
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting bad. Better get bad, Jack,

03:27.123 --> 03:29.626
because if you ain't bad, you're fucked.
That's right. We bad.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.835
Uh-huh.

03:31.502 --> 03:35.173
<i>The genius of </i>48 Hrs.
<i>is it occupies a middle space</i>

03:35.256 --> 03:39.469
<i>between Poitier's socially responsible</i>
<i>to the point of self-serious pieces…</i>

03:39.552 --> 03:41.596
What's the matter?
You afraid of catching my color?

03:41.679 --> 03:44.307
<i>…and Richard Pryor's</i>
<i>more audience-friendly racial schtick.</i>

03:44.390 --> 03:47.310
Look at that. Al Jolson
made a million bucks looking like that.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.229
<i>Directed by Walter Hill,</i>

03:49.312 --> 03:52.607
<i>one of the most successful action</i>
<i>directors this country has produced…</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:58.154
48 Hrs. <i>is a violent collision between</i>
<i>commercial and inflammatory elements.</i>

03:58.238 --> 04:00.156
Let me explain one thing to you, nigger.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.660
<i>The result is something</i>
<i>that feels fresh, unpredictable.</i>

04:04.369 --> 04:06.788
<i>A buddy comedy</i>
<i>that is neither about buddies…</i>

04:06.871 --> 04:09.582
-Jack…
<i>-…nor at the end, a comedy.</i>

04:09.666 --> 04:11.084
…tell me a story.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.043
Fuck you.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.545
Oh, that's one of my favorites.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.632
<i>Shaggy dog Jack, played by Nick Nolte,</i>

04:17.715 --> 04:20.343
<i>is a good cop willing to bend the rules</i>

04:20.426 --> 04:23.429
<i>to get convict Reggie Hammond</i>
<i>released on a 48-hour pass</i>

04:23.513 --> 04:26.599
<i>to help him catch</i>
<i>a vicious cop killer named Ganz.</i>

04:26.683 --> 04:28.851
-Thought you were locked up.
-I want the money, asshole.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.436
The money that Reggie hid.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.397
<i>Reggie and Ganz have history together.</i>

04:32.480 --> 04:35.942
<i>They were part of a crew on a heist gone</i>
<i>wrong that landed them both in prison,</i>

04:36.025 --> 04:39.028
<i>and Reggie is the only one</i>
<i>who knows where the money is hidden.</i>

04:39.112 --> 04:40.321
-That's the money, Jack.
Right.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.824
<i> It's a master plot</i>
<i>spiced up with a time limit.</i>

04:42.907 --> 04:46.744
<i>The cop only has 48 hours before he has</i>
<i>to take the convict back to prison.</i>

04:47.287 --> 04:49.998
<i>From the very start,</i>
<i>Jack and Reggie are at odds,</i>

04:50.081 --> 04:52.417
<i>but it's the unique</i>
<i>racial dynamics at play</i>

04:52.500 --> 04:56.045
<i>that elevate this cops-and-robbers tale</i>
<i>into something else.</i>

04:57.797 --> 05:00.133
-What happened?
-Just read the fucking report.

05:00.216 --> 05:03.720
<i> Early in the film, we see Jack</i>
<i>and his fellow cops at a police station,</i>

05:03.803 --> 05:07.181
<i>which Hill has taken pains to paint</i>
<i>as multiracial and multi-gendered.</i>

05:07.265 --> 05:09.058
There's nothing from your gun.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.810
<i>There's no racial division.</i>

05:10.893 --> 05:13.604
<i>It's diverse before the concept</i>
<i>gained cultural momentum.</i>

05:13.688 --> 05:15.898
<i>They're all members of the nation of cop,</i>

05:15.982 --> 05:19.485
<i>and aligned in their prejudice</i>
<i>against those they see as enemies.</i>

05:19.569 --> 05:20.486
<i>The "not cops."</i>

05:20.570 --> 05:23.698
-Is any of them walking around?
-One of the gang's still in the slam.

05:23.781 --> 05:24.949
Good.Good.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.659
Get in here, Cates!

05:26.743 --> 05:28.786
<i>Even Jack's boss, Captain Hayden,</i>

05:28.870 --> 05:31.122
<i>played by Frank McRae,</i>
<i>is African-American.</i>

05:31.831 --> 05:35.209
<i>There's tension between Jack and Hayden,</i>
<i>but it's not racial tension.</i>

05:35.293 --> 05:36.753
You better watch your ass.

05:36.836 --> 05:40.214
If you screw up,
I can promise you, you're going down.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.301
<i> Jack's not a guy</i>
<i>we would characterize as racist,</i>

05:43.384 --> 05:45.094
<i>though he will quickly be established</i>

05:45.178 --> 05:49.307
<i>as someone who is not above using</i>
<i>his systemic entitlement as a cudgel.</i>

05:52.018 --> 05:55.605
<i>Jack crosses the Richmond-San Rafael</i>
<i>Bridge on his way to San Quentin.</i>

05:56.147 --> 05:59.400
<i>For most directors, this kind</i>
<i>of establishing shot is just that.</i>

05:59.484 --> 06:02.195
<i>A way to mark a location</i>
<i>with a familiar landmark.</i>

06:02.278 --> 06:04.781
<i>But bridges hold</i>
<i>a special meaning for Walter Hill.</i>

06:04.864 --> 06:08.826
<i>They appear in his films at moments,</i>
<i>like in </i>Crossroads <i>or </i>Streets of Fire,

06:08.910 --> 06:11.996
<i>when his heroes are coming together</i>
<i>or pulling apart.</i>

06:19.045 --> 06:21.464
<i>Hill introduces Reggie singing "Roxanne,"</i>

06:21.547 --> 06:24.675
<i>by a band that I'm sure is</i>
<i>just coincidentally called The Police.</i>

06:27.178 --> 06:30.807
<i>An ad-lib by Eddie Murphy, it was</i>
<i>the first take of many that spoke to Hill,</i>

06:30.890 --> 06:34.352
<i>despite the expense of licensing</i>
<i>a song from the top of the charts.</i>

06:34.435 --> 06:37.814
<i>And it's the first hint of the movie star</i>
<i>Eddie Murphy will become.</i>

06:38.648 --> 06:42.276
<i>In a different version of this movie,</i>
<i>he'd be singing a racially coded song.</i>

06:42.360 --> 06:43.820
<i>But in a Walter Hill film,</i>

06:43.903 --> 06:48.032
<i>he's singing a song about a prostitute</i>
<i>being saved from a life of sex work</i>

06:48.116 --> 06:50.034
<i>by a man who won't share her</i>
<i>with someone else.</i>

06:50.118 --> 06:51.661
-Hey!

06:52.578 --> 06:54.831
<i> Whether a connection</i>
<i>is intended here or not,</i>

06:54.914 --> 06:57.375
<i>Reggie will soon take the role</i>
<i>of indentured servitude</i>

06:57.458 --> 06:58.960
<i>under Jack's rough hand.</i>

06:59.043 --> 07:00.878
I thought maybe you were a smart boy.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.672
<i>Throughout their scenes together,</i>

07:02.755 --> 07:05.883
<i>Jack keeps Reggie down</i>
<i>with plantation language, violence…</i>

07:05.967 --> 07:07.009
But I own your ass.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.344
<i>…and physical restraints.</i>

07:08.428 --> 07:10.471
Ain't no goddamn way
to start a partnership.

07:10.555 --> 07:14.517
Now get this. We ain't partners,
we ain't brothers, and we ain't friends.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.854
I'm putting you down and keeping you down
until Ganz is locked up or dead.

07:17.937 --> 07:21.232
And if Ganz gets away,
you're gonna be sorry you ever met me.

07:21.315 --> 07:25.570
<i>He states his role as that of "The Man,"</i>
<i>whose job it is to keep him in check.</i>

07:26.070 --> 07:27.613
<i>Established as not a racist,</i>

07:27.697 --> 07:31.701
<i>Jack nevertheless comfortably slides</i>
<i>into the role of violent oppressor.</i>

07:32.201 --> 07:35.788
<i>Hill sets the stage here</i>
<i>for </i>48 Hrs. <i>to be a loaded conversation…</i>

07:35.872 --> 07:36.873
You just hang on.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.333
<i>…about who literally holds the keys.</i>

07:40.126 --> 07:43.463
<i>The obvious move might have been</i>
<i>to make Jack the hero of the story…</i>

07:43.921 --> 07:47.008
<i>to involve us in his romantic failures</i>
<i>and his rebellious streak…</i>

07:47.550 --> 07:50.595
<i>his motivation of wanting</i>
<i>to avenge the murder of his friend.</i>

07:51.596 --> 07:54.432
<i>But I always and immediately</i>
<i>identified with convict Reggie…</i>

07:54.849 --> 07:57.977
<i>the bad guy, who, for me,</i>
<i>was not only never bad,</i>

07:58.060 --> 08:00.897
<i>but deserved every penny</i>
<i>of the money he stole.</i>

08:02.106 --> 08:05.443
<i>Reggie is clearly the oppressed,</i>
<i>but also clearly able.</i>

08:05.985 --> 08:10.490
<i>He's unapologetically horny, self-aware,</i>
<i>and the smartest guy in the film.</i>

08:12.033 --> 08:13.534
<i>We see this quick-witted agility</i>

08:13.618 --> 08:16.871
<i>when he apprehends Luther</i>
<i>while handcuffed to a steering wheel.</i>

08:17.371 --> 08:20.333
What's happening, Luther?
I'm sorry about the door. Did that hurt?

08:20.416 --> 08:22.710
-Hammond!
-<i>Jack isn't ready to concede.</i>

08:22.793 --> 08:24.295
Hand me that gun or you're dead.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.965
<i> He expresses his humiliation</i>
<i>by calling Reggie "watermelon,"</i>

08:28.049 --> 08:31.219
<i>an instant response to Reggie</i>
<i>gaining power in their relationship.</i>

08:32.094 --> 08:34.055
I don't know what you're smiling at,
watermelon.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.681
<i>Reggie fights back.</i>

08:35.765 --> 08:37.517
<i>He understands Jack's power.</i>

08:38.309 --> 08:41.812
<i>How a badge is permission</i>
<i>to transcend every barrier,</i>

08:41.896 --> 08:44.023
<i>physical and cultural.</i>

08:44.524 --> 08:45.608
So you a badass?

08:46.234 --> 08:49.070
You know, it's amazing how far
a gun and a badge will take some guys.

08:49.153 --> 08:52.406
<i> Reggie goads Jack,</i>
<i>teases him about his personal life.</i>

08:52.490 --> 08:53.991
Yo, man, tell me about this girlfriend.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.327
Tell me something about
what's her problem besides you?

08:56.410 --> 08:58.746
<i> He sleuths out clues</i>
<i>when Jack hits a dead end.</i>

08:58.829 --> 09:01.249
Speaking of moaning,
my stomach is starting to growl.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.126
<i>He's constantly distracting Jack</i>
<i>from his true motivation.</i>

09:04.544 --> 09:05.545
<i>Getting his money back.</i>

09:05.628 --> 09:07.421
There's your goddamn dinner.

09:07.505 --> 09:11.551
<i>It works, because Jack can't bear to be</i>
<i>in a subservient position to this convict,</i>

09:11.634 --> 09:12.718
<i>this Black man.</i>

09:13.135 --> 09:14.845
<i>Remember, Jack's a good cop…</i>

09:15.429 --> 09:19.809
<i>but he is still helpless to the systemic</i>
<i>racism hardwired into his behaviors.</i>

09:20.601 --> 09:23.020
<i>Reggie is using</i>
<i>Jack's programming against him.</i>

09:24.146 --> 09:25.523
All right, where to, convict?

09:25.606 --> 09:27.608
Mission District, catch us an Indian.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.618
I wonder what reservation
they let him off of.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.746
<i> Hill predicts this strategy</i>
<i>in the opening scene,</i>

09:40.830 --> 09:44.375
<i>in which chief villain Ganz</i>
<i>and his partner in crime, Billy Bear,</i>

09:44.458 --> 09:47.920
<i>use a chain gang boss's racism</i>
<i>to facilitate their escape.</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:50.423
Maybe you should have stole
a better truck, Tonto.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.676
<i> The plan presumes</i>
<i>that the guard is as casually racist</i>

09:53.759 --> 09:56.178
<i>as Ganz appears to be viciously racist…</i>

09:56.262 --> 10:00.016
-Take it easy, chief. He's only joking.
-…a<i>llowing for the exchange to escalate.</i>

10:00.099 --> 10:02.643
-Can I have the water, please, sir?
-Firewater, Tonto.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.271
-Is that what you mean? Firewater?
-Right!

10:05.354 --> 10:06.522
-Hey!

10:07.023 --> 10:08.733
<i>Billy and Ganz stage a brawl.</i>

10:09.442 --> 10:12.111
<i>It's possible the guard</i>
<i>can't even conceive of Billy Bear</i>

10:12.194 --> 10:13.946
<i>being a confederate of Ganz.</i>

10:14.655 --> 10:17.867
<i>I know, for nine-year-old me,</i>
<i>it came as a complete surprise.</i>

10:18.492 --> 10:20.161
<i>It wasn't until decades later</i>

10:20.244 --> 10:23.789
<i>that I realized how my own biases</i>
<i>had been indicted by this ruse.</i>

10:24.540 --> 10:27.627
<i>The guard's racism</i>
<i>ends up getting him killed.</i>

10:27.710 --> 10:28.878
Let's go!

10:30.004 --> 10:32.340
<i>-In Walter Hill's films…</i>
-Cribbs, you take point.

10:32.423 --> 10:38.763
<i>…from </i>Southern Comfort <i>to his late Western</i>
<i>cycle, </i>Broken Trail, Wild Bill, Geronimo<i>…</i>

10:39.347 --> 10:41.474
<i>and his pilot for David Milch's </i>Deadwood<i>…</i>

10:41.557 --> 10:45.978
Is there any other godless thing that
these godless, bloodthirsty heathens do?

10:46.062 --> 10:48.606
<i>…systemic racism</i>
<i>is the white man's greatest tool…</i>

10:49.315 --> 10:51.609
<i>and also the place</i>
<i>where he's the most vulnerable.</i>

10:51.692 --> 10:52.735
Fugitives are driving…

10:52.818 --> 10:55.196
<i>Race is America's Achilles' heel.</i>

10:55.279 --> 10:57.948
-Two men, one of them's Indian.
-Come on.

10:58.032 --> 11:01.786
<i> Ganz and Billy Bear are the first</i>
<i>of the film's two interracial couples.</i>

11:02.286 --> 11:05.873
48 Hrs. <i>is a contest between them,</i>
<i>a mirror for the other.</i>

11:05.956 --> 11:08.084
<i>Ganz and Billy are friends from the start,</i>

11:08.167 --> 11:12.254
<i>and Hill indicates that closeness as Ganz</i>
<i>procures a prostitute for his friend.</i>

11:12.755 --> 11:17.259
Now, make her an Indian.
No, not with a turban. You know, a squaw.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.638
<i>Jack doesn't facilitate sex for Reggie</i>
<i>until almost the end of the movie.</i>

11:20.721 --> 11:22.807
I got a 20. Have fun, huh?

11:23.265 --> 11:24.767
I'm gonna have sex, Jack.

11:25.393 --> 11:29.188
<i> If there are buddies in this</i>
<i>buddy picture, it's Ganz and Billy.</i>

11:32.858 --> 11:35.611
<i>Then there's that scene, the centerpiece,</i>

11:35.695 --> 11:38.948
<i>which occurs at almost exactly</i>
<i>the halfway point of the film</i>

11:39.031 --> 11:42.368
<i>as Reggie enters a honky-tonk,</i>
<i>a satire of whiteness.</i>

11:42.451 --> 11:43.619
Yeehaw!

11:46.664 --> 11:48.624
Not a very popular place
with the brothers.

11:49.208 --> 11:53.337
Always liked country boys.
They're sure as hell gonna like you.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.507
<i> I heard about this scene</i>
<i>long before I saw it.</i>

11:56.590 --> 11:57.425
Howdy.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.511
<i>Audiences at the time started laughing</i>
<i>before it even began.</i>

12:00.594 --> 12:01.971
<i>The excited vocalizations</i>

12:02.054 --> 12:05.141
<i>on that long lead-up</i>
<i>to the first fall on a roller coaster.</i>

12:05.641 --> 12:09.645
-I'd like something to drink!
Maybe best have a Black Russian.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.273
<i>-Screenwriter Larry Gross describes it</i>

12:12.356 --> 12:15.401
<i>as a toss-up in the early going</i>
<i>as to whether it would stay or go.</i>

12:15.484 --> 12:17.778
That's a funny joke. I get it. I'm Black.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.364
<i>Early test audiences were torn as well.</i>

12:22.533 --> 12:23.951
<i>But when the dust settled,</i>

12:24.034 --> 12:28.831
<i>here is this legendary moment where</i>
<i>Eddie Murphy emerges as Eddie Murphy.</i>

12:28.914 --> 12:31.125
I'm looking for Billy Bear.
You know where to find him?

12:31.208 --> 12:33.961
I don't give a shit what the fuck
your badge says, nigger.

12:34.044 --> 12:37.423
<i>It's all based on an African-American man</i>
<i>assaulting an entire bar</i>…

12:38.090 --> 12:40.176
<i>full of racist, redneck idiots.</i>

12:40.968 --> 12:45.514
<i>In an action movie filled with exciting</i>
<i>set pieces, this is the showstopper.</i>

12:45.598 --> 12:48.100
<i>Set in a caricature</i>
<i>of regressive whiteness</i>

12:48.184 --> 12:51.520
<i>dropped in the middle</i>
<i>of the most progressive city in America,</i>

12:51.604 --> 12:54.648
48 Hrs. <i>is many things,</i>
<i>but it's about race.</i>

12:55.191 --> 12:57.860
-I don't like white people.
-<i>It's worth stating again…</i>

12:57.943 --> 12:59.528
That means I'm enjoying this shit.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.948
<i>…this is Eddie Murphy</i>
<i>in his very first screen performance.</i>

13:03.032 --> 13:04.074


13:04.158 --> 13:07.787
Oh this is so fabulous. Ain't nothin' like
having a good meal with family.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.789
<i>Younger audiences may only know Murphy</i>

13:09.872 --> 13:12.666
<i>as a shape-shifting,</i>
<i>family-friendly performer.</i>

13:12.750 --> 13:15.127
<i>In fact, Murphy himself</i>
<i>has long driven the narrative</i>

13:15.211 --> 13:18.005
<i>of being a Black performer</i>
<i>white America can agree on.</i>

13:18.756 --> 13:20.800
<i>He's not Black or white. He's Eddie.</i>

13:21.300 --> 13:23.260
<i>But if you backtrack through </i>Shrek…

13:23.344 --> 13:24.637
You cut me deep, Shrek.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.639
-…<i>Dr. Dolittle</i>…
-Come on!

13:26.722 --> 13:30.059
…<i>Mulan, The Nutty Professor</i>
and <i>Coming to America</i>…

13:30.142 --> 13:32.311
Halt! When you think of garbage,
think of Akeem.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.563
<i>…you get back to the sharp edges of films</i>

13:34.647 --> 13:37.733
<i>like </i>Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places…

13:37.817 --> 13:41.487
-You don't know who you're messing with!
-May I suggest using your nightstick?

13:41.570 --> 13:43.280
<i>…and especially </i>48 Hrs.

13:44.031 --> 13:47.952
<i>Before the movies, he was a young stand-up</i>
<i>known for his blue routines</i>

13:48.035 --> 13:51.997
<i>and building heat as the first Black</i>
<i>breakout star of </i>Saturday Night Live.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.000
This is how you answer a door
in my neighborhood.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.794
Who is it?

13:57.795 --> 13:59.129
<i>He idolized Richard Pryor,</i>

13:59.213 --> 14:03.092
<i>who also talked dirty and influenced</i>
<i>people with sharp, polarizing material.</i>

14:03.175 --> 14:06.220
'Cause if you're in an argument
with another man, he may be white,

14:06.303 --> 14:08.639
but it's man-on-man for a minute,
and the shit get rough,

14:08.722 --> 14:10.516
he end up calling you "Nigger!"

14:11.016 --> 14:15.229
You gotta go, "Oh, shit.
Now, I ain't no man no more."

14:15.312 --> 14:20.025
<i>Which, like Eddie, led to edgy, socially</i>
<i>responsible films such as </i>Blue Collar…

14:20.109 --> 14:24.071
Everybody know what the plant is.
The "plant" just short for "plantation."

14:24.154 --> 14:24.989
Right on!

14:25.072 --> 14:27.658
<i>…before similarly ending up</i>
<i>in humiliating product</i>

14:27.741 --> 14:30.995
<i>as literally a toy for a rich white kid.</i>

14:31.662 --> 14:32.872
<i>I wonder if it's the price</i>

14:32.955 --> 14:36.375
<i>of any kind of real success</i>
<i>in the United States for minorities.</i>

14:36.458 --> 14:39.336
<i>Dial back the angry to keep the men</i>
<i>signing the checks happy.</i>

14:40.170 --> 14:44.675
<i>But in the scene at Torchy's, Eddie Murphy</i>
<i>is still at his most dangerous.</i>

14:44.758 --> 14:46.343
What the hell kind of cop are you?

14:47.344 --> 14:50.055
You know what I am?
I'm your worst fucking nightmare, man.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.934
A nigger with a badge. I got permission
to kick your fucking ass whenever I want.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.185
<i>And in this moment,</i>

14:55.269 --> 14:58.063
<i>he became the most important</i>
<i>Black actor since Sidney Poitier…</i>

14:58.647 --> 15:01.358
<i>and for many of the same</i>
<i>norm-shattering reasons.</i>

15:01.442 --> 15:03.944
-Where the fuck did you get this?
-Tax refund.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.864
Bullshit. You're too fucking stupid
to have a job.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.074
<i>He's an existential threat</i>
<i>to the ruling order</i>

15:09.158 --> 15:11.785
<i>in a way he arguably never will be again,</i>

15:11.869 --> 15:13.996
<i>not to this extent, on screen.</i>

15:14.622 --> 15:19.627
<i>Hill and Murphy are invested in discussing</i>
<i>race in ways that are frank, unadorned.</i>

15:20.669 --> 15:23.172
<i>Profane and profound.</i>

15:23.255 --> 15:26.216
<i>He's representative</i>
<i>of a threatening kind of Blackness.</i>

15:26.634 --> 15:30.804
<i>The kind that is aware of the tactics of</i>
<i>the white ruling class that hate his guts.</i>

15:30.888 --> 15:32.056
There's a new sheriff in town.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.935
<i>And he uses it</i>
<i>as his righteous sword and shield.</i>

15:37.186 --> 15:40.814
And his name is Reggie Hammond.
Y'all be cool. Right on.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.361
<i>Reggie has assumed Jack's power.</i>

15:45.444 --> 15:48.405
<i>And for that transgression,</i>
<i>Jack must reassert his.</i>

15:48.489 --> 15:50.532
I want to know
what the fuck this is all about.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.576
Maybe I don't like the way you asked me,
all right?

15:52.660 --> 15:55.704
Who gives a goddamn what you like?
You're just a spearchucker

15:55.788 --> 15:58.874
with a number stenciled
on the back of his prison fatigues.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.252
<i>They get into a fistfight,</i>
<i>and it must be said</i>

16:02.336 --> 16:05.339
<i>that there are few directors</i>
<i>who tell character better through action</i>

16:05.422 --> 16:06.590
<i>than Walter Hill.</i>

16:07.132 --> 16:09.218
<i>Their fighting styles are different.</i>

16:09.301 --> 16:11.136
<i>Jack's is wild and ungainly.</i>

16:12.554 --> 16:14.598
<i>Reggie's, is staccato and sharp.</i>

16:15.641 --> 16:17.142
<i>Reggie keeps his cool throughout…</i>

16:17.226 --> 16:18.310
You little fucker.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.938
<i>…until Jack throws him</i>
<i>on a pile of garbage.</i>

16:21.021 --> 16:22.898
You pushed me in the fucking garbage?

16:23.399 --> 16:26.485
<i>He recognizes the gesture</i>
<i>as condescending.</i>

16:26.568 --> 16:28.904
<i>A line has been crossed.</i>

16:28.988 --> 16:31.240
<i>It's outside the normal race-baiting.</i>

16:31.991 --> 16:35.786
<i>Reggie will not be demeaned</i>
<i>during the course of this 48 hours.</i>

16:42.001 --> 16:43.919
They saved your ass, convict.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.672
That's what you tell 'em
at the station house.

16:46.755 --> 16:50.050
Yeah, right.
I'll even put it in my report that way.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.136
Yeah, I bet you will.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.429
<i>When Jack tells Reggie</i>

16:53.512 --> 16:55.848
<i>that he's going to put in his report</i>
<i>that he won the fight,</i>

16:55.931 --> 16:58.434
<i>it's an acknowledgment</i>
<i>that though Jack has lost,</i>

16:58.517 --> 17:01.562
<i>he has the institutional power</i>
<i>to control the narrative.</i>

17:01.979 --> 17:02.896
Right, partner.

17:03.397 --> 17:07.026
<i>But one of the marvels of Murphy's</i>
<i>performance is his ability throughout</i>

17:07.109 --> 17:10.696
<i>to imbue Reggie with,</i>
<i>of all things, dignity.</i>

17:10.779 --> 17:15.117
Get this, man. We ain't brothers,
we ain't partners, and we ain't friends.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.911
If Ganz gets away with my money,
you'll be sorry you ever met me.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.122
<i>I have aspired all my life</i>

17:20.205 --> 17:24.043
<i>to have Reggie's confidence and dignity</i>
<i>in my own racial identity.</i>

17:31.467 --> 17:35.054
<i>Later, in Vroman's,</i>
<i>the exact mirror opposite of Torchy's,</i>

17:35.137 --> 17:38.265
<i>the pivotal scene in the movie</i>
<i>occurs as Reggie is in his element.</i>

17:38.348 --> 17:41.143
Vodka with a twist,
and I'd like to run up a tab, please.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.854
<i> You can tell,</i>
<i>because he's allowed to open a tab,</i>

17:43.937 --> 17:47.941
<i>and Hill, in another hallmark, gives</i>
<i>the band plenty of time to do their thing.</i>

17:48.025 --> 17:49.985
Hammond, where the hell are you?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.487
Vroman's in the Fillmore.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.866
Yeah, I know you don't know about
this place. The brothers hang out here.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.995
48 Hrs., <i>already an impeccable,</i>
<i>lean vehicle…</i>

18:00.537 --> 18:03.999
<i>in this moment becomes something</i>
<i>very much like an important film.</i>

18:05.709 --> 18:10.089
<i>At this moment, it doesn't matter what</i>
48 Hrs. <i>set out to be. At this moment…</i>

18:10.172 --> 18:11.215
Hammond!

18:11.298 --> 18:14.093
<i>…for an ostracized kid</i>
<i>looking to make sense of the senseless…</i>

18:14.176 --> 18:15.761
-Candy, this is Jack.
Hello.

18:15.844 --> 18:16.720
And goodbye.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.807
<i>…</i>48 Hrs. <i>is truly great.</i>

18:20.599 --> 18:21.767
<i>Jack apologizes.</i>

18:25.312 --> 18:28.023
"Nigger" and "watermelon,"
I didn't mean that stuff.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.068
I was just doing my job, keeping you down.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.781
Yeah, well, "doing your job"
don't explain everything, Jack.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.449
Yeah, you're right.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.868
<i>And Reggie tells him,</i>
<i>in an almost offhand way…</i>

18:40.869 --> 18:42.955
<i>…that Jack is not, in fact, forgiven.</i>

18:44.998 --> 18:47.835
<i>Even as a nine-year-old kid,</i>
<i>I recognized the grace</i>

18:47.918 --> 18:52.256
<i>of this practiced, measured dismissal</i>
<i>of a buddy's blindness to my pain,</i>

18:52.339 --> 18:53.549
<i>and the lengths I would go</i>

18:53.632 --> 18:57.010
<i>to make these uncomfortable moments</i>
<i>as invisible as I felt.</i>

18:58.512 --> 19:02.933
<i>When I first saw this film, I was too</i>
<i>young to unpack all of my reactions to it,</i>

19:03.016 --> 19:04.351
<i>much less begin to unravel</i>

19:04.434 --> 19:07.646
<i>the riddle of race and representation</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

19:08.188 --> 19:10.440
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>it's a knot we'll ever fully untangle.</i>

19:10.524 --> 19:12.651
I got five deaths related to Ganz,

19:12.734 --> 19:15.445
and you blow it
for a lousy nigger convict!

19:16.238 --> 19:18.949
That's right! I called him a nigger!
You bet I did!

19:19.032 --> 19:21.535
<i>There's no hugging it out</i>
<i>between Jack and Reggie…</i>

19:22.035 --> 19:25.122
<i>but there is devastating indictment</i>
<i>of how white and Black Americans</i>

19:25.205 --> 19:28.167
<i>circle around</i>
<i>these hyper-charged racial divides</i>

19:28.250 --> 19:32.129
<i>that are embedded in our country</i>
<i>without ever bridging that chasm.</i>

19:32.212 --> 19:36.300
Now wait a minute, goddamn it! I'm gonna
tell you something about this man.

19:36.383 --> 19:41.180
He has more brains than you'll ever know.
Got more guts than any partner I ever had.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.640
You go fuck yourself, convict!

19:44.725 --> 19:46.018
<i>At the end of it all,</i>

19:46.101 --> 19:49.021
<i>Jack goes back to his corner</i>
<i>and Reggie goes back to jail.</i>

19:49.104 --> 19:51.481
Wait a minute.
Ganz got away with all my money,

19:51.565 --> 19:53.734
and you gonna take me back to jail
in my own car.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.486
Somehow, this shit don't seem right.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.323
Yeah, a lot of things don't seem right.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.743
<i>They aren't friends, but they are closer</i>
<i>to what Ganz and Billy Bear were</i>

20:02.826 --> 20:04.536
<i>at the beginning of </i>48 Hrs.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.496
<i>Co-conspirators in a crime.</i>

20:07.122 --> 20:09.166
<i>Maybe that's as close as we ever get.</i>

20:09.917 --> 20:13.128
<i>When Reggie and Jack make a deal</i>
<i>about the money that Reggie's stolen…</i>

20:13.212 --> 20:14.630
This what you wanna talk about?

20:14.713 --> 20:18.926
<i>…it's predicated on trust, and there's</i>
<i>a feeling, confirmed by the sequel…</i>

20:19.009 --> 20:21.887
It's your money. It'll be there
in six months when you get out.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.805
<i>…that Jack's not to be trusted.</i>

20:23.889 --> 20:26.183
I'm gonna be an honest man
from now on, right?

20:27.809 --> 20:29.686
<i>Reggie isn't to be trusted either.</i>

20:29.770 --> 20:31.355
Can I have my lighter back, Reggie?

20:35.067 --> 20:38.403
48 Hrs. <i>isn't a buddy comedy,</i>
<i>because they're not buddies.</i>

20:39.154 --> 20:41.990
<i>And more than not being a comedy,</i>
<i>it's a tragedy</i>

20:42.074 --> 20:46.245
<i>in which whatever brotherhood discovered</i>
<i>by these men is abandoned at the end</i>

20:46.328 --> 20:48.830
<i>by the circumstances</i>
<i>of our shared reality.</i>

20:49.831 --> 20:51.792
<i>Maybe it's the great American tragedy…</i>

20:52.459 --> 20:55.128
<i>that however long</i>
