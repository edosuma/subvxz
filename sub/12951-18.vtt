WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:02.899
Previously on "Alias"...

00:02.900 --> 00:07.093
I met Emily after I started
working at Credit Dauphine.

00:07.200 --> 00:10.688
She was the mother
all of us wish we had.

00:10.799 --> 00:12.265
Emily, we did it.

00:12.266 --> 00:14.199
Are you sure it worked?

00:14.200 --> 00:16.700
Yes, my love.

00:17.866 --> 00:20.366
We're free.

00:25.499 --> 00:28.192
I've been sent here to
investigate Michael Vaughn.

00:28.299 --> 00:31.526
It's come to our attention
that over the past three months,

00:31.631 --> 00:36.460
Mr. Vaughn has been in contact
with unapproved operatives.

00:36.565 --> 00:38.063
You're being investigated.

00:38.064 --> 00:41.790
If there is some explanation
for what you've been doing

00:41.897 --> 00:44.397
I need to hear what it is.

00:45.297 --> 00:47.029
Right now.

00:47.030 --> 00:49.196
You suggest that
we allow Irina Derevko

00:49.197 --> 00:50.895
to make contact
with Arvin Sloane?

00:50.896 --> 00:54.589
I've had 20 years to reflect on
that woman's ability to deceive.

00:54.730 --> 00:56.228
Trust me.

00:56.229 --> 00:59.353
If she lies to me again,
I'll know it.

01:00.096 --> 01:02.596
The plan was for Mr. Sloane
to meet you here.

01:02.695 --> 01:05.592
For security reasons,
I'm afraid that's impossible.

01:05.695 --> 01:08.195
If you get in,
I'll take you to him.

01:13.729 --> 01:15.227
We've lost downlink.

01:15.228 --> 01:17.955
Jack, we're blind. You're
gonna have to follow her.

01:18.061 --> 01:21.117
- Activate the tracking device.
- I can't.

01:24.627 --> 01:27.127
Step out of the car, please.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.960
Thank you for extracting me.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.957 --> 02:09.457
Freeze!

02:40.022 --> 02:42.153
We have a casualty. Woman down.

02:42.154 --> 02:44.654
We need a medic.

03:13.219 --> 03:15.517
They'll keep me
in debrief for a while.

03:15.518 --> 03:16.684
You'll be okay.

03:16.685 --> 03:18.784
If you never see me again,
it was fun.

03:18.785 --> 03:19.851
Shut up.

03:19.852 --> 03:22.840
Mr. Vaughn, Mr. Yeager
would like to...

03:22.951 --> 03:25.451
Talk to me.
Yeah, I know.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.243
Dad, I need to talk
to you about Vaughn.

03:48.350 --> 03:50.482
- I know.
- He's innocent.

03:50.483 --> 03:52.983
He was investigating mom.
It wasn't treason.

03:53.016 --> 03:56.209
The operation in Panama
didn't go as planned.

03:56.315 --> 03:59.246
What happened?
Is mom okay?

04:00.549 --> 04:03.844
Your mother betrayed us,
betrayed the CIA.

04:05.349 --> 04:08.940
Her meeting with Sloane was
staged to secure her escape.

04:09.048 --> 04:11.741
Sloane could have set up
the meet to abduct her.

04:11.881 --> 04:15.244
Before the operation, she
swapped the Rambaldi manuscript.

04:15.348 --> 04:17.245
She left us with a fake.

04:17.247 --> 04:20.235
She and Sloane are now
in possession of the original.

04:21.779 --> 04:24.280
Sydney, they planned this.

04:54.844 --> 04:58.276
I heard about your mother.

04:59.744 --> 05:03.437
I'm so sorry.

05:06.544 --> 05:08.476
There's a briefing
in 10 minutes.

05:08.477 --> 05:11.931
They're drawing up a plan to
capture Sloane and your mother.

05:12.043 --> 05:15.804
I'm supposed to tell you
you're not obligated to go.

05:21.109 --> 05:22.674
My mother's earrings.

05:22.675 --> 05:24.342
They found a note she left.

05:24.343 --> 05:26.843
She wanted me to have them.

05:31.275 --> 05:33.674
Just now, when my dad
was telling me,

05:33.675 --> 05:38.606
the first thought I had
was that she was dead.

05:38.708 --> 05:41.208
That she'd been killed.

05:43.441 --> 05:46.600
I had this whole thing
in my head.

05:47.974 --> 05:50.837
That she died proving herself.

05:51.673 --> 05:54.173
A hero.

05:55.840 --> 05:59.272
No one can be blamed for
trusting their own mother.

06:01.872 --> 06:04.497
I wish that she had been killed.

06:13.972 --> 06:16.563
I still have operatives
in St. Petersburg,

06:16.671 --> 06:17.870
Madrid, and Cairo.

06:17.871 --> 06:19.004
How reliable?

06:19.005 --> 06:20.037
They're loyal.

06:20.038 --> 06:21.603
Good.

06:21.604 --> 06:24.104
You? You all right?

06:25.638 --> 06:27.337
The extraction went well.

06:27.338 --> 06:31.133
I'm asking about you, Irina.

06:32.804 --> 06:35.035
I'm happy to see you again.

06:35.036 --> 06:38.092
I was thinking
the same thing myself.

06:39.470 --> 06:41.269
What about the genetic database?

06:41.270 --> 06:43.235
Sark and I will
meet you in Zurich

06:43.236 --> 06:45.335
as soon as we've acquired it.

06:45.336 --> 06:46.702
You'll have the file soon.

06:46.703 --> 06:50.066
Good. I'll be in Tuscany
with Emily.

06:50.169 --> 06:51.601
How is she?

06:51.602 --> 06:54.124
She's in remission.

06:54.235 --> 06:56.894
The hard part for her now
is missing the people

06:57.002 --> 06:59.334
that she had to leave behind.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.835
Especially Sydney.

07:02.335 --> 07:05.732
You know how much we loved her.

07:05.867 --> 07:08.367
As if she were our own.

07:09.934 --> 07:12.434
Excuse us.

07:20.967 --> 07:23.660
I see through you.
You must know that.

07:23.766 --> 07:25.032
This is who I am.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.031
You may need to
think of yourself

07:27.032 --> 07:30.225
as an honorable husband
or father figure, but I don't.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.365
I will never see
that man in you.

07:32.366 --> 07:35.854
Which, frankly, is why
we have this agreement.

07:37.298 --> 07:40.127
You need to get some rest.

07:40.231 --> 07:44.424
Never talk to me about
your love for Sydney again.

07:47.131 --> 07:49.631
Get some rest.

07:58.264 --> 07:59.629
As many of you know,

07:59.630 --> 08:02.959
our attempt to capture
Arvin Sloane failed.

08:04.096 --> 08:07.357
We believe that Irina Derevko,
while in our custody,

08:07.496 --> 08:09.162
made contact with Sloane,

08:09.163 --> 08:11.663
informed him of our
intention to apprehend him,

08:11.762 --> 08:14.161
and used it as
an opportunity to escape.

08:14.196 --> 08:16.561
Due to Jack Bristow's
intimate knowledge

08:16.562 --> 08:19.994
of the fugitives in question
and his long-standing record

08:20.095 --> 08:23.254
of accurate predictions
regarding Derevko,

08:23.362 --> 08:26.350
Langley has given him
operational control

08:26.461 --> 08:28.961
of this task force.

08:32.927 --> 08:34.059
In all likelihood,

08:34.061 --> 08:37.322
Sloane and Derevko have formed
a strategic partnership.

08:37.460 --> 08:39.293
As of this morning,

08:39.294 --> 08:42.520
our single aim will be
their apprehension.

08:42.626 --> 08:45.683
Derevko has been tagged
with a passive tracking device.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.326
Excuse me, sir.
Sorry to interrupt.

08:48.427 --> 08:52.916
By the way, congratulations
on heading the task force.

08:53.026 --> 08:56.014
The device that we implanted
wasn't passive.

08:56.125 --> 08:58.024
Yes, it is.

08:58.025 --> 09:01.786
I removed the original device in
case Derevko was swept for bugs.

09:01.892 --> 09:02.657
Without her knowledge,

09:02.658 --> 09:04.457
I injected her
with a passive transmitter.

09:04.458 --> 09:07.049
Wow. Actually,
that's really smart.

09:07.159 --> 09:09.557
Because if they do a bug sweep,

09:09.558 --> 09:12.217
they won't pick up anything
until it transmits.

09:13.024 --> 09:15.524
How'd you plant it
without her knowing?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.456
The transmitter's programmed

09:19.457 --> 09:21.656
to send a signal
12 hours from now.

09:21.657 --> 09:24.282
That allows her enough time
to reach Sloane

09:24.390 --> 09:25.889
before going active.

09:25.890 --> 09:28.412
A tactical team is on standby.

09:28.523 --> 09:30.989
Once we acquire the signal,
we'll move in

09:30.990 --> 09:33.490
and take them into custody.

09:40.156 --> 09:42.781
I don't know what to say.

09:42.889 --> 09:45.650
This house is...

09:45.789 --> 09:48.583
When will we know
if they accept the offer?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.720
I closed last week.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.954
What?

09:53.955 --> 09:56.546
I wanted to surprise you.

09:56.654 --> 10:00.017
I just wanted to make you happy.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.608
These past few months
have been like a bad dream.

10:04.454 --> 10:06.954
Thank God we got through it.

10:08.486 --> 10:10.986
I love you.

10:22.419 --> 10:24.919
Nice grouping.

10:24.954 --> 10:27.419
Hey.

10:28.885 --> 10:30.217
What happened?

10:30.218 --> 10:32.740
They downgraded
my security clearance

10:32.851 --> 10:35.017
until counterintelligence
clears me.

10:35.018 --> 10:38.415
Your father convinced them
to keep me field-rated.

10:38.518 --> 10:41.018
Then you heard about my mother.

10:42.084 --> 10:44.584
Yeah.

10:47.051 --> 10:48.749
You were right
to investigate her.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.282
- Sydney...
- It's the truth.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.783
I am not blaming you.
It's me.

10:52.917 --> 10:55.417
I was so naive about her.

10:57.417 --> 11:00.211
I don't think you should be
part of this task force.

11:01.549 --> 11:03.715
You know how I feel
about Irina Derevko.

11:03.716 --> 11:07.704
But no one should have to hunt
down their own mother.

11:08.516 --> 11:10.614
She was never my mother.

11:10.615 --> 11:12.081
You want to believe that?

11:12.082 --> 11:13.914
Don't. Don't condescend...

11:13.915 --> 11:15.580
That is not what I'm doing.

11:15.581 --> 11:18.671
If you corner her and you
hesitate even for one second,

11:18.782 --> 11:21.282
it could cost you your life.

11:30.048 --> 11:32.548
I won't hesitate.

12:04.778 --> 12:06.443
Let me be blunt, Jack.

12:06.444 --> 12:09.035
I accepted your recommendation
to trust Derevko

12:09.144 --> 12:11.143
because you made
a strong argument.

12:11.144 --> 12:12.310
A personal one.

12:12.311 --> 12:15.038
Which I now understand
you didn't believe,

12:15.144 --> 12:16.909
or you would never have placed

12:16.910 --> 12:20.000
a transmitter on that woman
without informing me.

12:20.110 --> 12:22.610
It was my call to let her out.
I stand by that.

12:22.677 --> 12:24.776
But you blindsided me.

12:24.777 --> 12:28.072
And your pretense of an apology
doesn't do any good.

12:28.176 --> 12:29.641
I'll be equally blunt.

12:29.642 --> 12:32.075
From the moment
Irina Derevko walked in,

12:32.076 --> 12:34.075
you ordered Sydney
to deal with her

12:34.076 --> 12:35.207
over my objections.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.675
With absolute disregard
for her well-bring.

12:37.676 --> 12:39.708
That was my prerogative.

12:39.709 --> 12:43.868
That said, it's not
my intention to replace you.

12:43.975 --> 12:45.440
As soon as I'm satisfied

12:45.441 --> 12:48.066
that Derevko can never harm
my daughter again,

12:48.174 --> 12:50.674
you'll have your title back.

12:51.207 --> 12:52.073
Excuse me.

12:52.074 --> 12:55.062
I'm not sure who I'm
supposed to address.

12:55.174 --> 12:57.206
You're both here.
Who's in charge?

12:57.207 --> 12:58.739
- What is it?
- What do you want?

12:58.740 --> 13:02.263
The transmitter that Mr. Bristow
injected into his wife.

13:02.373 --> 13:03.939
Ex-wife. Sorry.

13:03.940 --> 13:05.705
It just went active.

13:05.706 --> 13:07.306
And we're tracking her.

13:07.307 --> 13:10.898
Base ops has tracked
Derevko's signal to Stuttgart.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.072
Once on the ground,
we will confirm

13:13.073 --> 13:14.605
with visual identification.

13:14.606 --> 13:17.935
We will not engage until we know
the whereabouts of all three.

13:18.039 --> 13:21.061
We move in only after
Derevko's led us to Sloane.

13:29.071 --> 13:31.237
Like many
pharmaceutical companies,

13:31.238 --> 13:34.067
the firm I represent
has monitored your work.

13:34.171 --> 13:35.803
Mapping the human genome.

13:35.804 --> 13:38.236
We are interested
in licensing that work.

13:38.237 --> 13:40.794
We are in the process
of fielding offers,

13:40.938 --> 13:44.529
I'm afraid your firm...
I'm not familiar with it.

13:44.671 --> 13:47.171
Oh, we're a small
Scandinavian consortium.

13:47.270 --> 13:48.535
I would not have come

13:48.536 --> 13:52.558
if I did not believe
my offer was significant.

13:53.169 --> 13:56.100
Our server room is where
the data is processed.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.268
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

13:58.269 --> 14:01.632
The servers are located
beyond radio contact.

14:01.735 --> 14:04.825
When you're prepared for
extraction, I'll be standing by.

14:06.201 --> 14:08.634
We're two blocks
from the signal.

14:08.635 --> 14:10.234
Any intel on that location?

14:10.235 --> 14:12.367
Brucker Biotech.

14:12.368 --> 14:14.868
The German Human Genome Project.

14:14.901 --> 14:16.833
We're running
a complete analysis.

14:16.834 --> 14:20.129
Every patent, biographies,
political contributions.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.300
Sloane and Derevko getting their
hands on genetic research.

14:22.301 --> 14:23.099
That can't be good.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.999
I've hacked into
their CCTV system.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.863
I'm relaying the feed
to you now.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.467
Let's see what we've got.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.390
Agent Bristow,
we're pulling into position.

14:55.831 --> 14:59.263
My name is Peter Garrow.
I'm Miss Herksgard's assistant.

14:59.364 --> 15:00.363
I'm running late.

15:00.364 --> 15:03.295
Would it be possible to have
a pass at the front desk?

15:03.398 --> 15:05.898
Thank you.

15:07.931 --> 15:10.063
Sark.

15:10.064 --> 15:12.529
We have an I.D.
He's entering the building.

15:12.530 --> 15:14.396
We see him.
Hold your position.

15:14.397 --> 15:17.124
For now. We've confirmed
Derevko and Sark.

15:17.230 --> 15:19.730
- That's good enough for me.
- Noted.

15:20.396 --> 15:23.055
It took 15 years of analysis,

15:23.195 --> 15:25.228
but we assembled the information

15:25.229 --> 15:29.183
into a high-resolution DNA map
of unequaled detail.

15:31.062 --> 15:33.562
Hey.

15:35.461 --> 15:36.794
Sark's taking out cameras.

15:36.795 --> 15:39.260
- We lost the feed.
- They may know we're here.

15:39.261 --> 15:41.761
There's a team out front.
We've been tracked.

15:41.827 --> 15:44.327
I swept myself.
I'm clean.

15:53.394 --> 15:54.459
Jack.

15:54.460 --> 15:57.017
- The mission’s compromised.
- It's not impossible.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.091
- We could lose everything.
- The transmitter is active.

16:00.226 --> 16:03.555
- We can track them.
- Sloane may not be here.

16:03.660 --> 16:06.160
They may not be
working with Sloane.

16:07.192 --> 16:08.325
I don't understand.

16:08.326 --> 16:10.917
When we extracted you,
we scanned for transmitters.

16:11.026 --> 16:13.526
It must have been
on a time delay.

16:17.991 --> 16:19.557
Do it.

16:21.691 --> 16:23.090
- We lost her.
- How?

16:23.091 --> 16:25.716
I don't know.
Fried somehow. Overloaded.

16:25.858 --> 16:27.390
There's nothing I can do.

16:27.391 --> 16:29.913
If we lose her now,
we lose her for good.

16:31.890 --> 16:32.889
Move in.

16:32.890 --> 16:35.787
Call Brucker. Tell them we have
terrorists on the premises.

16:35.890 --> 16:38.855
Have them seal the building.
We will meet them in the lobby.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.222
This will get us
into the hard drive.

16:41.223 --> 16:43.723
- Is the file on the network?
- Yes, but it's encrypted.

16:43.758 --> 16:46.223
I'll transfer the file.
We can decipher later.

16:46.323 --> 16:48.222
- How long to download?
- Five minutes.

16:48.223 --> 16:50.222
Make sure there's
no evidence we were here.

16:50.223 --> 16:52.588
All right. I'll set
the detonator for six minutes.

16:52.589 --> 16:55.089
Meet me at the extraction point.

18:12.116 --> 18:13.915
Vaughn.

18:13.916 --> 18:16.416
Vaughn.

18:26.749 --> 18:28.214
You okay?

18:28.215 --> 18:30.715
Yeah, I'm okay.

18:31.282 --> 18:34.111
Come on.
Come on.

18:38.581 --> 18:40.846
- What about Derevko?
- She's gotta be here.

18:40.847 --> 18:43.347
Sydney!

18:44.680 --> 18:47.180
Dad, I see her.

18:49.914 --> 18:52.112
We're going after her.

18:52.113 --> 18:54.613
She's exiting the building.

19:25.410 --> 19:27.910
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

19:34.943 --> 19:36.442
What's for dinner?

19:36.443 --> 19:38.541
Ribollita.

19:38.542 --> 19:41.201
It's bread-and-vegetable soup.

19:46.142 --> 19:48.441
That sounds great.
I'll get the Barolo.

19:48.442 --> 19:50.942
Okay.

20:12.806 --> 20:14.139
Hello?

20:14.140 --> 20:16.662
May I speak with your husband?

20:16.773 --> 20:19.171
Yes, just a moment.

20:19.172 --> 20:20.772
It's for you.

20:20.773 --> 20:23.273
It's a woman.

20:24.406 --> 20:26.505
Thanks.

20:26.506 --> 20:27.504
Yeah?

20:27.505 --> 20:30.005
I've recovered the file.

20:30.672 --> 20:33.172
But I was tracked.

20:34.005 --> 20:35.237
By whom?

20:35.238 --> 20:36.371
The CIA.

20:36.372 --> 20:40.394
Until we know, we have to assume
you've been exposed as well.

20:40.504 --> 20:43.526
You'd better leave the house
until we know for sure.

20:43.638 --> 20:44.904
Yeah. I agree.

20:44.905 --> 20:47.405
Meet me at the airfield.

20:48.870 --> 20:51.370
Okay.

20:55.803 --> 20:57.302
We have to leave.

20:57.303 --> 21:00.200
- What? Who was that?
- I'll explain everything later.

21:00.303 --> 21:02.569
We have to leave.
It's a precaution.

21:02.570 --> 21:04.602
Against what?
What's going on?

21:04.603 --> 21:07.659
Listen to me. We have to
leave the house now.

21:07.769 --> 21:09.601
I don't understand.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.801
Look at me.

21:10.802 --> 21:12.701
You have to trust me.
Please.

21:12.702 --> 21:15.202
You have to trust me.

21:20.269 --> 21:22.001
Aside from cancer studies,

21:22.002 --> 21:24.034
Brucker sponsored
genetic research.

21:24.035 --> 21:26.592
The mapping and
sequencing of chromosomes.

21:26.735 --> 21:28.766
It's rumored that
they have cataloged

21:28.767 --> 21:30.799
the DNA of private citizens.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.133
Some say millions.

21:32.134 --> 21:34.759
If that's true, then...

21:34.867 --> 21:37.066
Sorry to interrupt.
I just...

21:37.067 --> 21:38.165
Is that suede?

21:38.166 --> 21:40.666
Yes.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.894
Sloane could develop
a genetically targeted virus.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.261
He could pollute the water
supply to kill one person.

21:48.366 --> 21:51.695
When he or she takes
a drink of water or a shower,

21:51.799 --> 21:54.560
the water would permeate
to the system.

21:54.666 --> 21:57.359
I'll instruct the NSA
to add every derivation

21:57.466 --> 21:59.988
of "genetics" to
the Echelon watch list.

22:02.298 --> 22:03.931
Uh, excuse me one second.

22:03.932 --> 22:06.364
Did you say that
before the explosion,

22:06.365 --> 22:08.865
your mother called
your name?

22:09.198 --> 22:10.397
Yes.

22:10.398 --> 22:11.730
Why'd she do that?

22:11.731 --> 22:14.390
Doesn't that seem weird?
Or is that just me?

22:14.497 --> 22:16.396
It's cool if it is just me.

22:16.397 --> 22:18.062
It is just me, isn't it?

22:18.063 --> 22:21.290
Irina might have wanted
to save Sydney's life.

22:24.663 --> 22:27.288
I doubt that's the case.

22:32.429 --> 22:34.694
What do you mean,
you own this?

22:34.695 --> 22:37.592
It's my plane, sweetheart.
It's ours.

22:37.695 --> 22:41.649
I've been more than patient.
It's enough.

22:44.862 --> 22:47.362
Hello.

22:50.128 --> 22:52.628
I don't understand.

22:59.027 --> 23:01.527
Laura, I thought...

23:03.526 --> 23:06.026
Arvin will tell you.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.860
The disk.
As promised.

23:14.426 --> 23:15.558
Emily, sit down.

23:15.559 --> 23:17.225
How long have you known
she was alive?

23:17.226 --> 23:18.391
A couple of months.

23:18.392 --> 23:20.591
And you didn't tell me this?

23:20.592 --> 23:22.491
- What is going on?
- Emily...

23:22.492 --> 23:25.049
Tell me! Don't treat me
like a fool.

23:25.158 --> 23:27.558
Stop telling me
the deception is over.

23:27.559 --> 23:29.324
I had to wait.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.790
I wanted to make sure
it was gonna work.

23:31.791 --> 23:35.223
What are we doing here with
a woman who died 20 years ago?

23:35.324 --> 23:37.983
What I'm pursuing...

23:39.057 --> 23:40.756
...is truth.

23:40.757 --> 23:42.689
Truth?

23:42.690 --> 23:45.849
Good. Well, that
explains it all.

23:45.957 --> 23:49.081
I guess you and I are
looking for the same thing.

23:49.690 --> 23:53.383
Emily, what I'm looking for,
among other things...

23:54.257 --> 23:56.655
...will let you live
cancer-free.

23:56.656 --> 23:59.156
I am cancer-free.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.856
Forever.

24:07.688 --> 24:09.754
You're saying that
in high school,

24:09.755 --> 24:11.954
my girlfriend
dated the quarterback?

24:11.955 --> 24:15.750
It was no big deal.
He was just this god.

24:15.854 --> 24:17.320
What was his name? Frank?

24:17.321 --> 24:20.184
I forgot all about that guy.

24:20.288 --> 24:21.320
Wow.

24:21.321 --> 24:23.453
I went shopping,
and I saw something.

24:23.454 --> 24:25.954
It reminded me of you.

24:26.954 --> 24:28.620
You bought Vaughn a present?

24:28.621 --> 24:29.785
Why not?

24:29.786 --> 24:32.286
Because it's the weirdest
thing of all time?

24:32.287 --> 24:34.319
It reminded me of him.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.619
Maybe you could
do that for me sometime.

24:36.620 --> 24:39.051
Nice. Thanks.

24:39.052 --> 24:42.915
You're making me look bad.
I haven't bought him anything.

24:43.019 --> 24:46.382
Sydney's saying that you're
wearing suits. I thought...

24:46.518 --> 24:49.018
Oh, wow.

24:49.219 --> 24:51.776
It's beautiful.
Thank you. That's very sweet.

24:51.919 --> 24:54.419
You're welcome.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.917
We have to go.

25:04.885 --> 25:07.385
- What's going on?
- You need to see this.

25:09.517 --> 25:10.849
What is this?

25:10.850 --> 25:14.713
The camera at our consulate
in Florence last night.

25:27.983 --> 25:30.483
- She's alive.
- She walked through the door.

25:30.582 --> 25:33.241
Told the guard she was
the wife of Arvin Sloane.

25:33.349 --> 25:35.680
She wants to cooperate
with the CIA.

25:35.681 --> 25:38.181
She'll only talk to you.

26:11.846 --> 26:14.346
I spoke at your funeral.

26:15.346 --> 26:17.846
Arvin told me.

26:30.777 --> 26:36.175
Yesterday, I felt exactly
the way you do now.

26:36.310 --> 26:40.799
Seeing someone
I thought was gone.

26:40.910 --> 26:43.410
My mother.

26:43.509 --> 26:46.009
- You know.
- Yes.

26:46.643 --> 26:49.870
I never wanted to
put you through that.

26:49.976 --> 26:53.271
But Arvin and I had no choice.

26:53.376 --> 26:56.773
The Alliance had to
believe I was dead.

26:56.876 --> 26:59.966
You knew about his involvement
with The Alliance.

27:00.175 --> 27:02.675
And you stayed with him.

27:04.542 --> 27:07.837
I know this is difficult
for you to understand.

27:09.275 --> 27:13.707
But when I found out
I had cancer, Arvin...

27:15.140 --> 27:17.640
...was my tether.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.772
To hope.

27:19.773 --> 27:22.273
To survival.

27:23.340 --> 27:27.829
When I went into remission,
he told me the truth.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.440
He asked for my forgiveness

27:30.540 --> 27:33.903
and promised that he would
make things right.

27:34.839 --> 27:37.633
He's been my whole world
for 30 years.

27:37.739 --> 27:40.239
He saved my life.

27:42.472 --> 27:45.266
I couldn't deny my husband
a second chance.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.872
Except nothing's changed.

27:54.538 --> 27:57.265
I'm assuming that's
why you're here.

28:00.271 --> 28:02.771
He told me his plan.

28:03.270 --> 28:07.201
To find out what this man
Rambaldi was working on.

28:10.370 --> 28:13.267
He rationalizes what he's done.

28:13.370 --> 28:17.495
He says he's doing it
for us. For me.

28:19.669 --> 28:22.169
But even if I believed him...

28:23.035 --> 28:26.558
...I won't be the excuse
for his crimes.

28:26.668 --> 28:29.190
I won't live with that
on my conscience.

28:32.968 --> 28:35.468
I'll help you bring him in.

28:37.201 --> 28:40.792
But I need you to guarantee me
something in return.

28:41.968 --> 28:44.468
What?

28:46.334 --> 28:49.356
That he won't get
the death penalty.

28:50.567 --> 28:54.521
I want it in writing before
I tell you where he is.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.632
We can't make that deal.

28:58.633 --> 29:01.530
For all we know, Sloane sent
his wife to mislead us.

29:01.633 --> 29:02.798
Sydney trusts Emily.

29:02.799 --> 29:03.798
Congratulations.

29:03.799 --> 29:06.232
Is that enough reason
to take that chance?

29:06.233 --> 29:08.297
Why not threaten her
with prosecution?

29:08.298 --> 29:09.865
Compel her to tell us?

29:09.866 --> 29:11.431
Prosecution for what?

29:11.432 --> 29:12.631
Are you kidding me?

29:12.632 --> 29:15.132
Conspiracy, fraud,
aiding and abetting.

29:15.265 --> 29:16.797
We need Emily.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.592
I believe she'll lead us
to Sloane and Irina.

29:21.898 --> 29:23.430
Fine.

29:23.431 --> 29:25.931
It's your call anyway,
isn't it?

29:27.397 --> 29:28.896
Go to Florence with Dixon.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.796
I'll tell Sydney
to make the deal.

29:30.797 --> 29:34.092
A tactical plan will be ready
by the time you land.

29:35.597 --> 29:37.495
I'm meeting a man this afternoon

29:37.496 --> 29:39.629
who can get us six hours
on a Cray X1 computer.

29:39.630 --> 29:42.789
It should be able to decrypt
the genetic database.

29:45.896 --> 29:47.595
Are you there?

29:47.596 --> 29:51.119
What if I told you that
I wanted you to buy me out?

29:51.962 --> 29:56.053
That I'd be willing to sell you
the breadth of my assets.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.594
My contacts.

29:58.595 --> 29:59.994
All the Rambaldi artifacts

29:59.995 --> 30:02.620
I've acquired over
the last 30 years.

30:02.728 --> 30:04.594
Everything.

30:04.595 --> 30:07.651
I'd say either you're setting
me up to be killed...

30:08.927 --> 30:11.949
...or I underestimated
your love for your wife.

30:13.560 --> 30:16.582
Well, I'm going back
to Tuscany to see Emily.

30:16.694 --> 30:20.217
The house is safe.
Emily's meeting me there.

30:20.360 --> 30:24.485
I'll bring the database with me.
You can pick it up there.

30:24.626 --> 30:26.458
I can't blame Emily.

30:26.459 --> 30:28.959
She's right.

30:31.892 --> 30:34.392
I want out.

30:35.259 --> 30:37.258
This document guarantees

30:37.259 --> 30:39.557
that the Justice Department
will not pursue

30:39.558 --> 30:41.924
the death penalty
for your husband.

30:41.925 --> 30:45.856
Take a few minutes
to read it before you sign.

30:46.558 --> 30:49.058
I don't need to.

31:01.489 --> 31:04.454
You understand you're gonna
have to wear a wire.

31:04.556 --> 31:06.655
The operation’s being drawn up.

31:06.656 --> 31:09.883
The raid will be dangerous,
but you're gonna be fine.

31:09.989 --> 31:11.821
We will protect you.

31:11.822 --> 31:14.322
Sydney...

31:15.056 --> 31:17.681
I know I've disappointed you.

31:18.388 --> 31:21.979
That I chose to stay with Arvin.

31:24.121 --> 31:28.075
That I came here
asking you to show mercy

31:28.222 --> 31:33.119
for a man who took
so much away from you.

31:37.054 --> 31:39.679
You're in
an impossible situation.

31:43.820 --> 31:46.320
At your funeral...

31:49.086 --> 31:52.609
I said that I've always thought
of you as my real mother.

31:55.220 --> 31:57.720
I meant it.

32:23.383 --> 32:26.348
He's going to know.

32:26.450 --> 32:29.813
It's odd. I feel like
I'm talking to myself.

32:29.916 --> 32:33.439
It's comforting to know that
you're out there listening.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.749
Oh, God, I think he's here.

33:09.247 --> 33:12.041
The genetic database
is in the safe in the study.

33:12.147 --> 33:14.345
It's just off to the left.

33:14.346 --> 33:16.012
That's the combination.

33:16.013 --> 33:18.513
Are you certain about this?

33:19.846 --> 33:22.346
Yeah. Yeah.

33:30.812 --> 33:33.312
I'm sorry.

33:34.911 --> 33:37.876
There's no point in continuing
if you're not with me.

33:37.978 --> 33:40.010
We're on.

33:40.011 --> 33:42.511
You've said that before.

33:45.611 --> 33:47.009
It's different.

33:47.010 --> 33:49.804
What changed so much in one day?

33:51.144 --> 33:52.642
Everything.

33:52.643 --> 33:56.369
When Emily says she's going to
the wine cellar, we move.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.675
The things you've done.

33:59.676 --> 34:02.766
There's just been
too much suffering.

34:04.442 --> 34:06.775
You have every right
not to believe me.

34:06.776 --> 34:09.333
But it doesn't matter.

34:09.442 --> 34:10.841
You will.

34:10.842 --> 34:13.636
I will never leave you again.

34:20.541 --> 34:22.940
Arvin.

34:22.940 --> 34:25.440
I'm here to say goodbye.

34:32.607 --> 34:34.840
Emily.

34:34.841 --> 34:38.237
Do you remember how it felt
when I found you on the beach

34:38.340 --> 34:40.998
and I told you that it was over?

34:42.406 --> 34:44.871
- Arvin.
- All that matters is this.

34:44.873 --> 34:46.438
What we have between us.

34:46.438 --> 34:49.404
- Just stop.
- That no one else is a part of.

34:49.539 --> 34:52.039
Oh, God, please just stop.

35:14.870 --> 35:17.960
We lost the signal.
Sloane may have found the wire.

35:18.070 --> 35:21.126
The CIA's been listening.

35:23.703 --> 35:26.203
They're here.

35:29.536 --> 35:32.036
We have to go.

35:39.802 --> 35:42.302
Doesn't matter.

35:43.601 --> 35:45.434
All I need to know right now

35:45.435 --> 35:47.992
is whether you want
to come with me.

35:48.434 --> 35:49.733
Come with you?

35:49.734 --> 35:51.934
If you don't want to,
I'll understand.

35:51.935 --> 35:54.526
But, Emily, please.

35:54.668 --> 35:57.997
Please. You have to make
your mind up right now.

36:02.834 --> 36:05.334
Now.

36:10.666 --> 36:12.698
Yes.

36:12.699 --> 36:15.199
I will.

36:23.832 --> 36:26.332
Sloane!

36:37.964 --> 36:40.464
- Come on.
- Go.

36:41.397 --> 36:43.396
I have the disk.
Ready for extraction.

36:43.397 --> 36:45.897
Copy that.

36:56.696 --> 36:59.253
They're in some tunnel.
It starts to the east.

36:59.396 --> 37:01.228
Check to see where it leads.

37:01.229 --> 37:03.729
Copy. On my way.

37:20.294 --> 37:22.794
Freeze! Don't move!

38:58.187 --> 39:00.687
Go, go, go.

39:18.485 --> 39:20.985
Do you have the disk?

40:18.680 --> 40:22.577
# As the music #

40:22.680 --> 40:25.145
# At the banquet #

40:25.146 --> 40:27.112
Syd.

40:27.113 --> 40:29.613
Are you okay?

40:31.579 --> 40:34.079
I don't want to talk.

40:35.312 --> 40:36.478
Not now.

40:36.479 --> 40:39.001
# As the firelight #

40:39.112 --> 40:44.169
# In the night #

40:45.578 --> 40:48.339
# So are you to me #

40:48.444 --> 40:51.671
- Is that your phone?
- Mnh-mnh. Yours?

40:51.777 --> 40:52.810
No.

40:52.811 --> 40:55.076
# As the ruby #

40:55.077 --> 40:59.475
# In the setting #

40:59.577 --> 41:03.168
# As the fruit #

41:03.277 --> 41:06.208
# On the tree... #

41:08.709 --> 41:10.542
What is that?

41:10.543 --> 41:13.043
My mother's earrings.

41:14.376 --> 41:17.432
- I thought they were checked.
- They were.

41:19.608 --> 41:21.041
Wait.

41:21.042 --> 41:23.374
- It's a pattern.
- Dash-dot-dash.

41:23.375 --> 41:26.238
That's a "K."
Definitely Morse code.

41:27.341 --> 41:29.274
An "E."

41:29.275 --> 41:30.707
That's a "T."

41:30.708 --> 41:33.208
That's another "T."

41:40.207 --> 41:41.506
It's encoded.

41:41.507 --> 41:47.336
# As the wind blows
over the plain #

41:47.440 --> 41:49.940
What are you doing?

41:50.239 --> 41:53.965
# So are you #

41:54.072 --> 41:56.572
# To me #

41:59.339 --> 42:06.396
# So are you to me #

42:07.305 --> 42:13.541
