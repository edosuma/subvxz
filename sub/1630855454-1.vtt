01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:42.864
- I told you to wait.

01:17:42.899 --> 01:17:44.734
That was so stupid.

01:17:44.769 --> 01:17:46.461
- You left me for hours.

01:17:46.496 --> 01:17:47.869
- I had to go
to three different places.

01:17:47.904 --> 01:17:49.772
Alright?
She could have seen you.

01:17:49.807 --> 01:17:52.434
- Well, my dad knows I lied,
and I have to quit the troupe.

01:17:58.013 --> 01:17:59.144
- I'm sorry.

01:17:59.179 --> 01:18:01.146
Hey.

01:18:01.181 --> 01:18:03.247
I'm sorry, it's just--

01:18:03.282 --> 01:18:05.480
it got so messed up, and I...

01:18:10.355 --> 01:18:12.157
- I have
to tell you something.

01:18:19.199 --> 01:18:22.068
Rebecca saw me.

01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:25.236
- What?

01:18:25.271 --> 01:18:28.239
- She brought y'all food,

01:18:28.274 --> 01:18:31.044
and she saw me climb
out the window.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.015
And...

01:18:35.050 --> 01:18:36.247
she knows.

01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:39.921
- What do you mean she knows?

01:18:39.956 --> 01:18:41.791
- Well, I had to tell her.

01:18:41.826 --> 01:18:43.452
- You didn't have
to tell her anything.

01:18:46.589 --> 01:18:48.358
Oh, shit.

01:18:50.527 --> 01:18:52.934
Shit.
Shit.

01:18:52.969 --> 01:18:54.430
- Owen.
- Oh, no.

01:18:55.202 --> 01:18:57.565
No, no.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.436
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:19:00.471 --> 01:19:01.437
Okay.

01:19:01.472 --> 01:19:03.945
- Maybe it's God.

01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:06.442
Maybe now it's time.

01:19:06.477 --> 01:19:09.313
- For what?

01:19:09.348 --> 01:19:11.018
- To tell everyone.

01:19:12.219 --> 01:19:15.022
- What?
No.

01:19:15.057 --> 01:19:18.190
- Why not?
- You--you don't understand.

01:19:18.225 --> 01:19:19.961
It's not--
- No, I do understand.

01:19:19.996 --> 01:19:21.193
- I just need--
I just need a minute

01:19:21.228 --> 01:19:22.964
to think, okay?

01:19:24.264 --> 01:19:25.461
Okay.

01:19:25.496 --> 01:19:28.937
So...

01:19:28.972 --> 01:19:32.072
Jem...

01:19:32.107 --> 01:19:34.041
I reckon we should stop,
just for a little while.

01:19:36.012 --> 01:19:37.308
- What?

01:19:37.343 --> 01:19:38.848
- Yeah, I just need
some time to think,

01:19:38.883 --> 01:19:40.575
and just reckon it would
be better to be delicate.

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:43.446
- I--what--
what do you mean?

01:19:43.481 --> 01:19:46.350
- I mean, let's pray on this.

01:19:46.385 --> 01:19:48.550
- No, I don't wanna stop.

01:19:48.585 --> 01:19:49.892
- Just for a little while.

01:19:49.927 --> 01:19:51.223
Okay?
- Owen.

01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.622
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:54.657 --> 01:19:56.162
- Just for a little while.
- I don't--

01:19:56.197 --> 01:19:57.196
- I really gotta
get back, Jem.

01:19:57.231 --> 01:19:59.363
I really gotta get back.

01:19:59.398 --> 01:20:01.233

- Every word out of your mouth

01:29:55.092 --> 01:29:56.531

impure thoughts?

01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:33.122
Did you feel overtaken
by them?

01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.798
- I don't know.

01:31:38.833 --> 01:31:40.965

with Owen begin?

01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:44.705
And...

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:46.608

01:31:50.306 --> 01:31:51.613
Why would you ask?

01:31:58.314 --> 01:31:59.819
- He and I talked about it.

01:31:59.854 --> 01:32:02.085
And if we could just explain--
- Explain what?

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.823
- That we--we're meant
to be together.

01:32:03.858 --> 01:32:07.794
- Stop it.
- Woah, enough, alright.

01:32:11.734 --> 01:32:13.602
You've let Satan
into your heart.

01:32:13.637 --> 01:32:14.999
- I haven't.

01:32:15.034 --> 01:32:17.672
- No, you have.

Satan has got his hold on you.
