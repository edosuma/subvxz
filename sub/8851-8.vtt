00:58.968 --> 01:02.364
This infernal machine!

01:02.432 --> 01:04.766
I appreciate your spending
your Sunday fixing it.

01:04.834 --> 01:08.337
Better than another
Sunday in an empty house.

01:08.932 --> 01:11.574
You know me circumstance.

01:13.278 --> 01:14.679
Ain't going to lie to you.

01:14.747 --> 01:16.480
What would you do

01:16.548 --> 01:17.981
if you were married to a woman

01:18.049 --> 01:20.284
whose heart was for another?

01:22.639 --> 01:25.390
It's a big world, Mr. Toole.

01:27.929 --> 01:32.266
Eva's me wife. I'm making me stand.

01:33.116 --> 01:35.637
Hold on.

01:38.961 --> 01:40.295
Thanks.

01:40.415 --> 01:42.578
Mr. Durant is returning.

01:42.646 --> 01:43.812
Yeah.

01:44.093 --> 01:45.828
His train is at council bluffs.

01:45.896 --> 01:47.963
He could be here as soon as tonight.

01:51.137 --> 01:53.505
More reason to get this
machine fixed by tomorrow

01:53.573 --> 01:55.074
so we can finish the bridge.

01:55.142 --> 01:57.811
Show how valuable you
are to the railroad.

01:59.649 --> 02:02.129
He's going to know you had a hand
in raising this bridge, too.

02:02.130 --> 02:04.822
I'm not so sure.

02:06.258 --> 02:08.359
Shall I see you later?

02:09.961 --> 02:11.730
When I fix the engine.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.801
Right.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.551
Durant's on his way back.

02:26.789 --> 02:29.956
I can finish up here if you
want to get back to town.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.424
That's what I'd do.

02:31.492 --> 02:33.560
You ain't me.

03:14.713 --> 03:16.957
Man don't know nothing
about building no house.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.633
Foundation first, then chimney.

03:19.701 --> 03:21.069
Any fool know that.

03:21.137 --> 03:22.871
Ain't you got somewhere to be?

03:22.939 --> 03:26.243
Not on the lord's day.

03:26.310 --> 03:29.148
Lord want me here, watch that
chimney fall on your head.

03:31.686 --> 03:34.619
Yeah, you funny. Mm-hmm.

03:34.687 --> 03:38.821

03:38.889 --> 03:40.826
Only folks stay behind
on the railroad is

03:40.893 --> 03:42.630
them scrawny-ass clodhoppers with

03:42.697 --> 03:45.634
them saggy-titted wives
and squawking-ass babies.

03:45.701 --> 03:47.335
That what you want to be?

03:47.403 --> 03:49.671
Yeah. Something like that.

03:54.211 --> 03:57.612
Y'all go on ahead.

03:59.283 --> 04:02.421
Hell, you gonna do it, do it right.

04:04.525 --> 04:06.959
You got to lay in a second wall of rock,

04:07.026 --> 04:10.398
lest the whole thing fall
down on your head, huh?

04:26.990 --> 04:28.223
I'll take 3, too.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.760
Let's hope it's a good time for you.

04:30.828 --> 04:32.563
One...

04:34.466 --> 04:35.467
Come on. Get up.

04:35.535 --> 04:37.832
What? Let's go.

04:37.899 --> 04:40.335
Oi. I'm out.

04:42.603 --> 04:45.239
Don't go too far. We
love taking your money.

04:45.307 --> 04:47.942
Yeah. Just don't give up me seat.

04:48.009 --> 04:50.609
That bast... that
bastard Durant is back.

04:50.677 --> 04:53.548
He'll be looking for the
payment for his land parcels.

04:53.616 --> 04:57.385
Durant? Really?

04:57.452 --> 05:00.019
So, pay him. Back to me game.

05:00.087 --> 05:03.893
I need my cut from this place.

05:03.960 --> 05:07.927
Well, I'm sorry. I'm a bit short.

05:07.995 --> 05:11.200
Bad run of luck.

05:11.268 --> 05:13.803
And drinking up the rest, no doubt.

05:13.871 --> 05:17.607
Ma was right. You're a shambles,

05:17.675 --> 05:19.677
just like dad.

05:23.885 --> 05:26.053
I'm the proprietor here.

05:26.121 --> 05:27.421
This is my place of business.

05:27.488 --> 05:28.721
Our place of business.

05:28.789 --> 05:30.491
I stuck my neck out
floating a land parcel

05:30.559 --> 05:31.794
for Mr. Ferguson for it.

05:31.862 --> 05:33.298
Come on. I know you have money.

05:33.366 --> 05:34.700
What do you got on you?

05:34.768 --> 05:38.407
No, Sean. You're embarrassing me.
Stop it.

05:39.875 --> 05:42.810
I'll do worse than that if
you're holding out on me.

05:44.548 --> 05:46.651
We'll see.

05:55.662 --> 05:57.997
Damn it.

06:02.568 --> 06:04.703
And thank you for...

06:04.770 --> 06:09.608
All you've done these past weeks.

06:09.676 --> 06:14.678
Now, it's time to go take care
of that husband of yours.

06:14.746 --> 06:17.179
At least let me walk you to the office.

06:17.246 --> 06:21.885
I should be seen making my way to
the office under my own steam.

06:33.905 --> 06:35.340
Please, take it.

06:35.407 --> 06:38.711
And...

06:38.779 --> 06:42.379
If you ever need anything for
yourself or your child...

06:42.446 --> 06:44.616
Thank you, Mr. Durant.

06:52.297 --> 06:54.433
Good-bye.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.504
Good-bye.

07:22.824 --> 07:27.491
Mr. Gunderson, that
is Mr. Durant's desk.

07:31.766 --> 07:34.101
And those are his personal ledgers.

07:34.169 --> 07:36.470
Yes, Mrs. Bell. That is true.

07:36.537 --> 07:39.470
I was gathering them
under direct orders.

07:39.538 --> 07:42.539
Direct o... from Mr. Durant?

07:42.607 --> 07:44.107
No. From me.

07:49.478 --> 07:51.781
I'm Hannah Durant,

07:51.849 --> 07:53.851
Mr. Durant's wife.

07:56.323 --> 07:57.790
Hello.

08:33.756 --> 08:34.789
Mr. Durant!

08:34.857 --> 08:38.260
How wonderful that you're back.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.067
What are you up to, McGinnes?

08:47.673 --> 08:49.675
Nothing at all, sir.

08:54.015 --> 08:55.350
I...

08:57.857 --> 09:02.291
Whatever happened to the
magic lantern show?

09:02.359 --> 09:05.996
Well, my brother and I manage
the pleasure house now.

09:06.064 --> 09:07.665
And we're partners in the saloon.

09:07.732 --> 09:10.533
I took in a...

09:10.601 --> 09:14.402
Magic lantern show in Chicago.

09:14.470 --> 09:19.340
Two men caught a tiger under a barrel.

09:19.408 --> 09:20.974
Great story.

09:22.142 --> 09:26.044
The two young men were
devoured by the tiger.

09:28.382 --> 09:30.381
Think about it.

09:36.255 --> 09:37.822
Sir, I will.

10:03.754 --> 10:07.024
Well, then. I'll be seeing
you for dinner later.

10:07.092 --> 10:09.095
Of course.

10:24.933 --> 10:27.103
Mr. Bohannon.

10:31.011 --> 10:33.813
You're back early.

10:35.214 --> 10:37.714
Damn miracle I got back here at all.

10:37.782 --> 10:41.219
Yeah. How you maintaining?

10:41.286 --> 10:43.821
Is my bridge built?

10:43.889 --> 10:45.223
Almost.

10:45.291 --> 10:47.691
About wore out that damn steam engine.

10:47.757 --> 10:50.725
So, no bridge.

10:50.793 --> 10:52.428
All right.

10:52.496 --> 10:55.597
For your sins, you will
come to dinner tonight

10:55.665 --> 10:57.698
with me and my wife.

10:57.765 --> 11:00.001
Your wife?

11:00.069 --> 11:02.440
Don't look so horrified.

11:02.507 --> 11:04.841
And wear a clean shirt.

11:06.343 --> 11:08.610
Yes, sir.

11:08.678 --> 11:12.180
And... Mrs. Bell will be your escort.

11:13.781 --> 11:15.449
Understood?

11:15.516 --> 11:19.820
Yeah. Understood.

11:23.790 --> 11:26.590
Why you looking so down, hmm?

11:26.657 --> 11:30.425
Look how good this hearth draw, huh?

11:30.493 --> 11:34.694
All you need now is some walls, windows,

11:34.761 --> 11:37.698
door, roof. Practically done.

11:40.337 --> 11:42.903
Toole going to kill Eva and the baby,

11:42.971 --> 11:45.804
if the baby come out like me.

11:45.872 --> 11:50.276
Look here. That ain't going to happen.
Hear me?

11:50.344 --> 11:51.711
Who going to stop it?

11:51.779 --> 11:54.550
Every damn body, you hear me?

11:54.617 --> 11:56.682
That's who.

11:56.748 --> 11:58.879
You'll be the best father for that baby,

11:58.947 --> 12:00.280
far as I can tell.

12:00.348 --> 12:02.947
How you mean?

12:05.050 --> 12:07.553
He'll be mixed. Mulatto.

12:07.621 --> 12:11.590
Whatever you wanna say.
He'll be like you, right?

12:11.658 --> 12:14.289
Yeah, I suppose.

12:14.357 --> 12:17.124
Who be better for him, hmm,

12:17.192 --> 12:20.361
than somebody just like him?

12:22.563 --> 12:24.565
I ain't never thought
about it like that.

12:24.633 --> 12:29.403
See, you'd be his father.

12:29.470 --> 12:30.970
And I'd be his uncle Psalms.

12:32.672 --> 12:35.076
I'll teach him all the
things you ought not to.

12:35.143 --> 12:37.514
Hey, there, rascal, you pull
that girl's skirt back down.

12:39.682 --> 12:41.684
In Chicago,

12:41.751 --> 12:44.486
you ain't never seen nothing
like them buildings.

12:44.554 --> 12:47.823
Some of them are, like, 6 stories tall.

12:47.891 --> 12:50.993
You should see the buildings
in New York... twice that.

12:51.060 --> 12:55.833
Me brother lives in a
building 10 stories tall.

12:57.268 --> 12:59.202
Would you take me to New York?

12:59.269 --> 13:01.036
Of course.

13:02.504 --> 13:06.471
Well, depending on... You know.

13:06.539 --> 13:08.174
What?

13:08.242 --> 13:10.478
The baby.

13:10.545 --> 13:13.911
You mean, when the baby's fit to travel?

13:18.718 --> 13:21.051
Just say what you're thinking.

13:23.016 --> 13:26.518
If the baby's born white, Eva,

13:26.585 --> 13:28.421
then we can meet me family.

13:28.489 --> 13:30.956
Well, see, I thought...

13:31.023 --> 13:33.422
You said that you'd put
that aside, Mr. Toole.

13:33.490 --> 13:36.690
Me brother wouldn't.

13:38.292 --> 13:39.692
In the saloon, the men are wagering

13:39.693 --> 13:42.360
whether the baby will
be born white or...

13:42.428 --> 13:46.266
Something else.

13:49.936 --> 13:51.938
Shall we leave this place?

13:55.076 --> 13:56.643
Maybe.

13:58.610 --> 14:02.282
It's a big world, after all, isn't it?

14:10.125 --> 14:12.492
All right. You ready?

14:19.203 --> 14:21.104
It's going to be a wonderful evening.

14:21.171 --> 14:23.040
I'm sure you'll adore them.

14:23.107 --> 14:26.676
As for your flaxen-haired
maiden of the west...

14:26.744 --> 14:28.311
Fair-haired maiden of the west.

14:28.378 --> 14:30.978
Just like most of your enthusiasms.

14:31.046 --> 14:34.285
I understand. She's
attractive and capable.

14:34.353 --> 14:37.423
And very smart.

14:37.490 --> 14:40.226
And that makes her very dangerous.

14:40.294 --> 14:42.927
Do you think she may have
deciphered our mileage from...

14:42.995 --> 14:45.028
They... here they are.

14:45.095 --> 14:48.030
Here you are. Come in. Come in.

14:48.098 --> 14:52.198
Mr. Bohannon. Pleased to
make your acquaintance.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.465
Same here, ma'am.

14:53.533 --> 14:55.602
Now, you'll come right over here

14:55.670 --> 14:58.639
and sit on my right.

14:58.706 --> 15:00.373
Lily, forgive me, I...

15:00.440 --> 15:01.373
Mrs. Bell.

15:01.441 --> 15:02.976
Mrs. Bell, please.

15:03.044 --> 15:04.145
Andrew. Yes?

15:04.213 --> 15:05.726
Close those shades and shut the door

15:05.727 --> 15:07.047
and see that we're not disturbed.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.449
Yes, ma'am.

15:45.216 --> 15:46.785
Thank you, Andrew.

15:46.853 --> 15:48.488
Well, bon appetit.

15:48.555 --> 15:50.888
So...

15:50.956 --> 15:54.159
Tell me where you're from, Mr. Bohannon.

15:54.227 --> 15:55.594
Meridian, Mississippi.

15:55.662 --> 15:58.132
Is yours a cotton family?

15:58.200 --> 16:01.036
Was. Ain't nothing left.

16:01.104 --> 16:02.371
Of course.

16:02.438 --> 16:04.707
Thomas, didn't we know someone

16:04.775 --> 16:06.943
with the railroad in meridian?

16:07.011 --> 16:09.745
Is there a railroad there, Mr. Bohannon?

16:09.813 --> 16:13.785
Yes, ma'am, mobile and Ohio had a
railhead there before it burned.

16:13.853 --> 16:15.386
Leonidas Tate.

16:15.454 --> 16:17.588
Yes, Leo Tate.

16:17.655 --> 16:20.992
He had shares in credit
mobilier, didn't he?

16:21.060 --> 16:23.729
We used to summer with
the Tates in New York,

16:23.797 --> 16:25.530
on long island sound.

16:25.598 --> 16:29.833
I doubt Mr. Bohannon is
interested in our, uh,

16:29.900 --> 16:33.703
sailing stories with the Tates.

16:41.411 --> 16:43.245
Matter of fact,

16:43.313 --> 16:46.046
I married Mr. Tate's
youngest daughter Mary.

16:48.651 --> 16:50.751
It was there at Christ church.

16:50.818 --> 16:53.252
Well, small world.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.785
Well, tell us, how is she?

16:57.324 --> 16:59.457
She's dead.

17:03.897 --> 17:06.500
The war took her.

17:15.311 --> 17:21.450
Did your family know
Richard McLemore, then?

17:21.518 --> 17:23.558
He and my grandfather laid
the very first spur line

17:23.559 --> 17:24.891
in Lauderdale county.

17:24.959 --> 17:26.893
God, Bohannon,

17:26.961 --> 17:29.763
I just might send you to
New York one of these days

17:29.831 --> 17:32.466
to deal with the board on my behalf. Ha!

17:32.534 --> 17:35.136
Unless memories of the
city would be too painful.

17:35.204 --> 17:39.376
Well, my eyes are set west
to the future, Mr. Durant.

17:39.444 --> 17:40.884
I think you know that about me, too.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.916
Well said, Mr. Bohannon.

17:43.984 --> 17:47.621
Well, this has been lovely,

17:47.688 --> 17:49.757
but I must go.

17:49.824 --> 17:52.627
I'm so sorry.

17:52.694 --> 17:55.664
All this talk of the railroad
must have been so boring for you.

17:55.734 --> 17:59.203
Not at all. After all, my future
is bound to the railroad also.

17:59.271 --> 18:03.042
Of course. It's very tragic,
what happened to your husband.

18:03.109 --> 18:04.944
Well, it's just good
we could provide you

18:05.012 --> 18:07.146
with some employment, in the meantime.

18:07.213 --> 18:08.713
In the meantime. Until you decide

18:08.781 --> 18:10.848
where you're going to
reestablish yourself,

18:10.916 --> 18:12.983
someplace more conducive.

18:14.585 --> 18:17.352
Of course. Thank you.

18:17.420 --> 18:19.354
I'll walk you to your car.

18:19.421 --> 18:23.188
There's no need, really. Good night.

18:23.256 --> 18:25.723
Good night. Good night... Mrs. Bell.

18:25.791 --> 18:28.191
I'll accept that offer, Mr. Bohannon,

18:28.259 --> 18:30.860
seeing as though my husband
is still enjoying his brandy,

18:30.927 --> 18:32.528
aren't you, dear?

18:32.595 --> 18:34.662
Yes, of course.

18:34.730 --> 18:37.431
You should know that Mrs. Bell has been

18:37.499 --> 18:40.100
very important to the railroad.

18:40.168 --> 18:42.171
She's done a lot to get us this far.

18:42.238 --> 18:45.208
Does that include
sleeping with my husband?

18:47.210 --> 18:48.710
I...

18:48.778 --> 18:50.480
I ain't around much.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.348
You ain't.

18:52.416 --> 18:55.784
Why do you hide your
breeding, Mr. Bohannon?

18:55.852 --> 18:59.154
I guess I just got used to
traveling low to the ground.

19:01.023 --> 19:02.791
Regarding Mrs. Bell,

19:02.858 --> 19:04.960
my husband is making some changes.

19:05.027 --> 19:08.164
Is Mr. Durant firing her?

19:08.232 --> 19:11.167
Be careful with whom you align yourself.

19:11.234 --> 19:15.371
My husband believes you have
a future on the railroad,

19:15.439 --> 19:17.811
and I do, too.

19:17.879 --> 19:19.879
Yeah?

19:22.247 --> 19:24.384
You hardly know me.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.992
Yes, but my instincts...

19:29.059 --> 19:31.628
Are always right.

19:33.465 --> 19:35.836
Good night, Mr. Bohannon.

19:35.904 --> 19:38.072
Good night.

19:52.199 --> 19:54.135
Lily...

19:54.202 --> 19:57.308
Mr. Bohannon.

20:06.047 --> 20:08.884
We need to dis...

20:10.060 --> 20:14.099
we need to discuss your
progress on my bridge.

20:14.167 --> 20:16.607
Mrs. Bell has an estimate. I
think we should ask her opinion.

20:16.608 --> 20:17.605
I'm asking yours.

20:17.673 --> 20:20.241
Two weeks.

20:20.309 --> 20:21.949
If the weather holds
and we work Sundays.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.014
Not good enough. One week.

20:24.082 --> 20:26.249
We're dangerously behind schedule.

20:26.316 --> 20:29.018
Whose schedule would that be?

20:29.086 --> 20:30.754
Yours, Mr. Bohannon.

20:30.822 --> 20:33.359
It was on your advice

20:33.427 --> 20:35.861
that we decided to bridge
the gorge at this point.

20:35.929 --> 20:37.729
Yes, sir. And we made
good time, considering.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.597
Considering what, Mr. Bohannon?

20:39.665 --> 20:42.870
Indians. Strike. Wash-out.

20:42.937 --> 20:46.074
All I need is a structure

20:46.141 --> 20:48.077
that will support a locomotive

20:48.145 --> 20:50.114
from one side of the gorge to the other.

20:50.181 --> 20:52.451
Understand?

20:55.054 --> 20:57.955
I'll, um...

21:00.721 --> 21:04.125
I'll drive it across the bridge myself.

21:04.193 --> 21:06.362
How about that?

21:23.515 --> 21:26.084
Can we speak in private?

21:27.821 --> 21:29.822
Yes.

21:40.932 --> 21:42.863
Got something for you.

21:44.266 --> 21:46.535
It's a Claddagh ring.

21:46.603 --> 21:48.204
From home.

21:49.273 --> 21:50.739
You're offering it to me?

21:50.807 --> 21:53.541
I mean, I'm a successful businessman,

21:53.609 --> 21:55.677
and you're starting in your church...

21:55.745 --> 21:57.785
I thought when you gave me
the land for the church,

21:57.786 --> 21:59.106
it came with no strings attached.

21:59.107 --> 22:00.383
These aren't strings, Ruth.

22:00.451 --> 22:02.018
It's a token of my affection.

22:02.085 --> 22:04.954
Proposing marriage, Sean?

22:05.022 --> 22:08.694
It's how you wear it. Um...

22:08.761 --> 22:11.562
On your right hand,

22:11.629 --> 22:15.067
pointed toward your wrist means...

22:15.135 --> 22:16.870
Your heart is captured.

22:19.940 --> 22:24.081
I would like you to wear
it like that for me.

22:27.021 --> 22:28.653
It's a bit small.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.260
But I'll keep it, Sean.

22:33.327 --> 22:35.129
And you will think about it?

22:36.999 --> 22:41.505
I just need a little time.
This is all so fast.

22:43.407 --> 22:45.274
Of course.

22:45.341 --> 22:48.548
With your father's death,
and then, your church...

22:48.615 --> 22:51.286
Take your time.

22:51.354 --> 22:54.356
I'll find a ring that fits better.

22:54.424 --> 22:56.192
Good-bye.

23:09.552 --> 23:11.254
Hey!

23:11.321 --> 23:13.556
Let's get into position like
we went over this morning.

23:13.623 --> 23:14.957
Aye!

23:15.025 --> 23:17.323
Check the corner braces and line her up.

23:17.391 --> 23:19.693
Hold tight, Mr. Toole.

23:24.563 --> 23:26.096
All right, together!

23:26.163 --> 23:29.298
She's lifting up. You lay
them braces, all right?

23:29.366 --> 23:30.333
Aye, we will!

23:30.401 --> 23:32.937
Give it speed, Mr. Toole.

23:55.889 --> 23:58.420
Easy on the lift, Toole. Damn it.

24:02.322 --> 24:07.159
Watch your foot. Keep that rope in line.

24:16.001 --> 24:18.204
The valve's stuck!

24:21.841 --> 24:23.806
Mother of God, Jesus!

24:23.874 --> 24:26.442
Get back!

24:28.878 --> 24:30.945
- Cullen, look out!
- Look out!

24:47.358 --> 24:50.894
Get it off of me! Get it off!

24:52.297 --> 24:54.663
Help! Help!

24:54.731 --> 24:56.296
Somebody!

24:56.364 --> 24:58.131
Can somebody help us?

25:12.409 --> 25:14.711
Hurry up, get these
men to the infirmary.

25:14.778 --> 25:16.013
Toole.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.884
I need help getting him off.

25:17.952 --> 25:20.032
I want you to tear that damn
thing apart right there

25:20.033 --> 25:21.085
and tell me why she blew.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.721
Overworked and overloaded, Mr. Bohannon.

25:23.789 --> 25:24.989
Do it.

25:25.056 --> 25:26.490
Yes, sir.

25:26.558 --> 25:27.858
Mr. Toole.

25:32.566 --> 25:34.561
I thought maybe you would have been glad

25:34.562 --> 25:35.602
that I had been flattened.

25:35.670 --> 25:37.037
No. I was worried about you.

25:37.104 --> 25:38.338
Did... did you get hurt?

25:38.405 --> 25:41.943
No, just bit by a bit of steam is all.

26:04.466 --> 26:07.137
What in God's name has happened now?

26:07.205 --> 26:08.740
Steam engine blew.

26:08.808 --> 26:11.242
Well, you should have
been more careful, then.

26:11.310 --> 26:13.590
I ain't the one that wanted
to cross the gorge in a week.

26:13.591 --> 26:15.311
Don't blame me for your
failures, Bohannon.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.518
It's not my fault you blew the engine.

26:17.586 --> 26:19.955
And it ain't my fault that
you oversold our mileage

26:20.023 --> 26:21.391
to the board back east.

26:21.459 --> 26:23.292
Mr. Bohannon.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.829
You are out of your depth.

26:25.897 --> 26:28.734
Thomas, let's get you back inside.

26:34.474 --> 26:36.809
You need to fix this.

27:02.599 --> 27:05.730
Joseph, where did...

27:05.798 --> 27:09.168
I was worried you weren't
being provided for.

27:10.070 --> 27:11.371
Where did you go?

27:11.439 --> 27:13.138
Into the long country.

27:13.205 --> 27:15.773
I prayed and fasted.

27:15.841 --> 27:18.677
I realized I am, and always
will be, a Cheyenne.

27:18.745 --> 27:20.379
No, you are a baptized Christian.

27:20.446 --> 27:22.550
Ruth, after I became a Christian,

27:22.617 --> 27:25.785
I killed my brother, and
I killed your father.

27:29.058 --> 27:31.526
I broke my father's heart,

27:31.594 --> 27:34.563
just like you broke mine.

27:35.732 --> 27:38.066
I'm sorry, Joseph.

27:38.133 --> 27:41.201
I didn't come here for your pity.

27:41.269 --> 27:44.007
I came here to bring you food,

27:44.074 --> 27:49.015
to tell you while I was hunting,
I saw the white spirit.

27:49.082 --> 27:51.684
I don't believe in ghosts, Joseph.

27:51.752 --> 27:53.718
Your father was right.

27:53.786 --> 27:56.220
This is a bad place.

27:56.288 --> 27:58.091
You should leave.

28:00.595 --> 28:01.995
I've just started a new church.

28:02.062 --> 28:03.360
I can't leave.

28:03.428 --> 28:05.795
Then you will die.

28:15.855 --> 28:17.055
Tell me you found the problem.

28:18.554 --> 28:20.424
I pulled the whole bloody thing apart.

28:20.492 --> 28:24.590
There's something keeping the presser...
the pressure valve's stuck.

28:24.657 --> 28:26.257
Pressure valve.

28:26.323 --> 28:28.290
Let me see it.

28:49.350 --> 28:51.953
It's an ore coin.

28:52.020 --> 28:54.357
A Norwegian penny.

28:54.425 --> 28:57.062
Mr. Swede.

28:58.864 --> 29:00.767
Put this back together double-time.

29:00.835 --> 29:02.303
We got a bridge to build.

29:02.371 --> 29:04.839
I reckon I don't understand.

29:04.907 --> 29:06.776
It's like he wanted us to know.

29:06.844 --> 29:10.747
It's exactly like that, Mr. Toole.

29:24.101 --> 29:25.135
Good morning.

29:25.203 --> 29:26.938
I'm going to work.

29:27.006 --> 29:29.240
You can't just push me out.

29:29.308 --> 29:30.976
I'm trying to run a railroad.

29:31.044 --> 29:32.378
So am I.

29:32.446 --> 29:34.980
Thomas, you made me a promise.

29:35.048 --> 29:36.549
I did?

29:36.616 --> 29:38.084
Yes.

29:38.152 --> 29:39.954
I have done the work.

29:40.022 --> 29:41.890
I've been by your side
when you needed me,

29:41.958 --> 29:46.162
and I've kept thing going when
you were at death's door.

29:46.229 --> 29:48.896
You're not naive, lily.

29:48.964 --> 29:53.067
Pretending to be only diminishes you.

29:53.134 --> 29:55.438
Naive?

29:55.506 --> 29:57.774
We've shared so much.

29:57.841 --> 29:59.175
How can you deny that?

29:59.243 --> 30:00.444
Yes.

30:00.512 --> 30:04.450
You seem quite fond of sharing.

30:06.286 --> 30:10.995
How does Bohannon know about the
mileage shortfall on this railroad?

30:14.333 --> 30:16.100
Um.

30:16.167 --> 30:19.096
Did you lay with him?

30:22.331 --> 30:24.462
Did you lay with him?!

30:24.529 --> 30:27.965
Thomas, I've given everything
of myself for this railroad.

30:28.032 --> 30:32.537
Yes, you certainly have.

30:33.939 --> 30:37.107
If you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

30:43.814 --> 30:45.816
If I take the two cards and not...

30:45.883 --> 30:48.618
I have no idea what an
inside straight is.

30:48.685 --> 30:49.652
Excuse me.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.121
You've had your time.

30:51.188 --> 30:52.586
Durant wants to see me.

30:52.654 --> 30:55.388
Yeah, I got your money.
I'm not giving it to you.

30:55.456 --> 30:58.356
I want my share, Mick. You owe me.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.993
That's right. Ha ha ha.

31:01.061 --> 31:05.168
For the paper you floated on the
negro's sorry scrap of mud bank.

31:05.235 --> 31:08.172
Yeah.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.609
Yeah.

31:09.677 --> 31:14.418
That should cover it.

31:14.485 --> 31:18.585
Now, bugger off.

31:18.653 --> 31:21.023
I want my fair share, Mick.

31:21.090 --> 31:23.491
I'm in a jam.

31:24.994 --> 31:26.762
This was your plan, huh?

31:26.830 --> 31:29.532
To palm the deeds and hope
that Mr. Durant died,

31:29.599 --> 31:30.933
and that no one would find out?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.500
And they call me the family idiot.

31:32.568 --> 31:33.701
I want my money.

31:33.769 --> 31:35.302
I'm not giving it to you.

31:35.368 --> 31:37.088
I will not be party to
you paying the debts

31:37.089 --> 31:38.649
of some church whore across the street.

31:38.650 --> 31:39.606
Watch your mouth.

31:39.673 --> 31:42.677
Aye, it's an Indian-laying
church whore, by the way.

31:44.448 --> 31:46.852
Aye!

31:56.367 --> 31:59.339
Get out!

31:59.407 --> 32:01.109
Come here!

32:05.619 --> 32:06.920
Will you listen to me?

32:06.987 --> 32:09.289
Just... aah!

32:13.264 --> 32:15.064
Just listen!

32:15.132 --> 32:16.099
Get back!

32:16.166 --> 32:17.902
Listen to me!

32:21.310 --> 32:22.942
Son of a bitch.

32:23.944 --> 32:26.312
Aah!

32:27.514 --> 32:29.249
Get...

32:29.317 --> 32:30.616
Aah!

32:30.684 --> 32:31.917
No. No!

32:31.985 --> 32:33.285
Just stay there. Stay there.

32:33.353 --> 32:35.454
Take back... take back what you said.

32:35.521 --> 32:39.455
Jesus, Sean. Everybody in town knows.

32:39.523 --> 32:41.591
It's not true.

32:41.659 --> 32:42.625
It is.

32:42.693 --> 32:44.825
I just saw them together.

32:46.493 --> 32:48.327
Ask her yourself.

32:49.195 --> 32:50.695
I'm your brother, Sean.

32:50.763 --> 32:54.231
I'm not the problem, she is.

32:54.299 --> 32:56.801
Let me go.

32:56.869 --> 33:01.611
I tasked you with being my eyes and ears

33:01.679 --> 33:03.048
on this railroad.

33:03.116 --> 33:04.636
I don't work for the railroad no more.

33:04.684 --> 33:06.218
Really?

33:06.285 --> 33:09.055
No, sir. Got me a place
down by the river.

33:09.123 --> 33:11.059
Settled down.

33:25.739 --> 33:27.240
Now, you listen to me.

33:27.308 --> 33:31.478
I own every piece of land
between here and council bluffs

33:31.546 --> 33:34.282
and as far as you can see
in either direction.

33:34.351 --> 33:36.851
Mr. McGinnes and me, we
have an arrangement.

33:36.919 --> 33:39.820
There are only two ways
to leave this railroad.

33:39.888 --> 33:41.921
You die in my employ,

33:41.989 --> 33:45.625
or you walk back through
Indian territory.

33:47.528 --> 33:52.163
Back to whatever squalid slave
shack from which you came.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.167
This ain't right. It ain't right.

33:56.771 --> 34:01.374
If the sun rises on your
sorry ass in the morning,

34:01.441 --> 34:05.313
I will have you shot for trespassing.

34:05.380 --> 34:07.580
Is that what you want?

34:08.916 --> 34:10.583
What you just tore up,

34:10.650 --> 34:13.350
that's what I want.

34:13.418 --> 34:16.319
I want to build me a house
down by that river,

34:16.386 --> 34:19.121
where I can lock my damn door at night.

34:21.324 --> 34:24.192
Know that that's my damn house.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.096
And my damn property.

34:26.163 --> 34:28.443
And I can shoot any damn man
that comes through that door

34:28.464 --> 34:31.297
and tell me it ain't mine.

34:32.466 --> 34:35.434
I ain't afraid to work, Mr. Durant,

34:35.501 --> 34:38.705
but I ain't gonna be your
damn nigger no more.

34:39.708 --> 34:42.908
What I want is some respect.

34:42.976 --> 34:45.511
And if I got to take it
out of your damn hide,

34:45.579 --> 34:50.380
or anybody else's, I will.

34:53.619 --> 34:58.024
Mr. Ferguson.

34:58.092 --> 34:59.827
Have a seat.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.401
Please.

35:09.604 --> 35:12.943
Did I come at a bad time?

35:14.011 --> 35:17.280
No, I... I was just resting.

35:17.347 --> 35:20.449
Thomas told me you had words.

35:20.516 --> 35:21.950
He did?

35:22.018 --> 35:24.687
There are no secrets between us.

35:24.755 --> 35:27.791
You were not a surprise to me.

35:28.691 --> 35:30.626
I see.

35:30.694 --> 35:32.295
I told him that I thought he was wrong

35:32.363 --> 35:34.132
to speak to you in that way.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.770
You've been very instrumental

35:35.838 --> 35:37.438
in the building of the railroad.

35:37.506 --> 35:39.807
And if it wasn't for you, we
wouldn't have stayed afloat

35:39.875 --> 35:41.775
during Thomas' recovery.

35:44.113 --> 35:45.213
Thank you.

35:45.281 --> 35:47.215
That's why what I am going to ask you

35:47.282 --> 35:48.816
is so difficult.

35:48.884 --> 35:51.887
In light of Thomas' injuries

35:51.955 --> 35:55.156
and his nightly discomfort,

35:55.224 --> 35:59.161
well, it's just not possible
for us to share a bed.

36:04.462 --> 36:07.465
You want me to leave my train car.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.568
I need suitable accommodations.

36:09.636 --> 36:13.639
I'm sure you understand.

36:15.043 --> 36:17.412
I have nowhere else to go.

36:17.479 --> 36:20.849
You're a smart girl.

36:20.916 --> 36:23.254
You seem to know your way around.

36:25.091 --> 36:26.731
I'm sure you'll find something.

37:03.518 --> 37:06.005
You don't have to leave.

37:06.125 --> 37:09.058
I've seen how you fare in the tents.

37:09.126 --> 37:11.978
Can't build another floorboard.

37:12.215 --> 37:14.482
That's not funny.

37:14.549 --> 37:16.165
I know it ain't.

37:16.285 --> 37:18.014
You know, you could stay.

37:18.448 --> 37:21.054
Thomas already knows.

37:21.122 --> 37:24.789
No, he only thinks he does.

37:25.891 --> 37:28.360
Yeah, well, he's right.

37:30.628 --> 37:33.431
Lily...

37:33.499 --> 37:35.066
You shouldn't test a man

37:35.134 --> 37:38.168
who's jealous or afraid
for his livelihood.

37:38.236 --> 37:39.569
Especially not when he's both.

37:39.636 --> 37:42.039
Hey.

37:42.909 --> 37:45.545
Don't want to test a man.

38:17.575 --> 38:20.246
Is it true?

38:22.615 --> 38:25.115
Sean, you can't be here.

38:26.183 --> 38:30.557
I need to know if it's true.

38:31.493 --> 38:33.394
You've been drinking.

38:42.538 --> 38:44.170
Did you?

38:44.237 --> 38:46.704
Sean, you're scaring me.

38:46.771 --> 38:49.139
Joseph.

38:53.042 --> 38:56.145
Did you and he...

38:56.213 --> 38:58.548
Don't.

38:58.615 --> 39:03.017
People say you had relations.

39:03.086 --> 39:04.888
People lie.

39:04.955 --> 39:08.923
Mickey saw you together.

39:10.725 --> 39:13.230
What do you want from me?

39:13.297 --> 39:16.030
I want the truth.

39:16.097 --> 39:17.764
Get out.

39:17.832 --> 39:22.103
I want the truth!

39:26.641 --> 39:30.746
And I thought it was me you wanted.

39:41.261 --> 39:43.998
You have to go.

39:45.936 --> 39:48.304
Please go.

41:04.312 --> 41:07.046
This ain't no boarding house.

41:09.783 --> 41:13.588
From the looks of it,
it ain't even a house.

41:18.795 --> 41:23.537
What happened, Durant kicked you
out of your fancy railroad car?

41:23.604 --> 41:25.970
Something like that.

41:29.544 --> 41:30.979
What about you?

41:31.046 --> 41:34.717
You get tired of building
your dream house?

41:40.987 --> 41:43.821
Something like that.

41:49.425 --> 41:51.826
Might as well.

41:58.464 --> 42:02.902
You ought to know, Mr. Durant
offered me a new job.

42:02.969 --> 42:04.601
Yeah?

42:04.669 --> 42:08.571
Yeah.

42:10.071 --> 42:12.071
He want me to do something

42:12.138 --> 42:16.075
I'm sure you ain't gonna like at all.

42:17.377 --> 42:19.344
What's that?

42:30.551 --> 42:33.587
What'd you tell him?

42:33.654 --> 42:37.455
Told him I'd think about it.
