00:04.104 --> 00:07.072
[Ron groaning]

00:07.074 --> 00:08.974
Teeny tiny tasty bits...

00:08.976 --> 00:09.942
[groaning]

00:09.944 --> 00:13.012
Is neither teeny nor tiny!

00:13.947 --> 00:15.614
Almost... almost, huh?

00:15.616 --> 00:20.152
Oh, hey, robo buddy,
thanks for the lift.

00:22.655 --> 00:24.523
[Angry gibberish]

00:29.996 --> 00:31.864
Whoa, instant inventory update.

00:31.866 --> 00:36.235
So, fraternizing with the new
stockbots I see, Stoppable.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.670
Mr. Barkin, robots are
the way of the future.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.273
Yeah, I've seen it on the
movies and infomercial channel.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.642
Really? And how
did that work out?

00:43.644 --> 00:47.579
The robots enslaved humanity
and harvested their brains.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.281
Exactly! It's just
a matter of time

00:49.283 --> 00:52.217
before these stockbots
take over our jobs

00:52.219 --> 00:57.790
hey, wake up! The robos
want to be the man!

00:57.792 --> 00:58.657
Which man?

00:58.659 --> 00:59.892
The man that keeps us down!

00:59.894 --> 01:01.627
You pick a side, Stoppable,

01:01.629 --> 01:02.928
before it's too late.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.029
Hi, Mr. Barkin.

01:04.031 --> 01:06.231
He seems extra
Bark-iny today.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.034
Stockbot issues.
So, ready for lunch?

01:09.036 --> 01:10.169
It's double-twist Tuesday!

01:10.171 --> 01:12.337
Pretzels from
smarty's snack bar again?

01:12.339 --> 01:14.139
Could we maybe
get something else?

01:14.141 --> 01:15.841
Uh, yeah, best not, K.P.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.242
Ordering off
the daily specials menus

01:17.244 --> 01:20.079
presents a whole set
of freshness concerns.

01:20.081 --> 01:23.148
Ok, one sec.
Got an incoming message.

01:23.917 --> 01:24.750
Oh, no.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.251
Ron, you ok?
What is it?

01:26.253 --> 01:30.355
Uh, Martin smarty himself
is coming to the store.

01:30.357 --> 01:31.290
To see me!

01:31.292 --> 01:36.328
No, K.P., Mr. Smarty
only shows up if he's...

01:36.330 --> 01:38.697
If he's firing someone!

01:38.699 --> 01:40.632
[Beeping]

to go habitate
turtles and cats,

02:54.875 --> 02:57.342

02:59.013 --> 03:02.781
It's ok, Rufus. I'll
be strong for both of us.

03:02.783 --> 03:06.418
No, I won't!
[Crying]

03:06.420 --> 03:08.253
I want my vest!

03:08.255 --> 03:11.323
But Mr. smarty, Ron's
your most loyal employee.

03:11.325 --> 03:15.127
I know, that's why I've got an
important assignment for him.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.728
[Sniffles] Assignment?

03:16.730 --> 03:20.032
Stoppable, you are the model
smarty mart employee.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.968
Dependable, responsible,
and smart!

03:22.970 --> 03:25.204
You'll make
the perfect life coach

03:25.206 --> 03:26.171

[Giggles]

03:29.176 --> 03:30.108
Cute kid.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.410
Uh, and a life coach is?

03:31.412 --> 03:33.345
Look, my boy
needs a role model,

03:33.347 --> 03:35.714
and I want you to be
that model, or else.

03:35.716 --> 03:39.117
Or else... next visit's
the firing kind.

03:39.119 --> 03:39.985
Make smart choices, son.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.353
You're not the boss of me!

03:41.355 --> 03:44.256

just a bundle of...

03:44.258 --> 03:45.891
uh, I... I don't
know what.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.026
Heh, Artie!
My good dude.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.328
Well, I'm Ron...

03:49.330 --> 03:51.396
uh, yeah, that's what I said.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.832
Uh, yeah, that's what I said.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.933
Both: Ok, stop that.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.368
Stop saying what I'm saying.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.370
K.P., he keeps say...

03:58.372 --> 04:01.173
[gasps]

04:01.175 --> 04:04.409
Ok, I give up.
We've been at this all day.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.012
There's got to be something
that you want to steal!

04:07.014 --> 04:09.848
What's wrong with
the global incinerator ray?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.817
It's mundane.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.285
Quantum gravity drill?

04:13.287 --> 04:14.820
B.T.D.T.

04:14.822 --> 04:20.859
Acronyms are very handy
when texting one's B.F.F.S.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.995
Wait, stop there!

04:22.997 --> 04:24.162
U.R.C.!

04:24.164 --> 04:26.932
The ultimate remote control!

04:26.934 --> 04:28.300
Oh, a channel flipper?

04:28.302 --> 04:32.004
You just love to stomp
on my dreams, don't you?

04:32.006 --> 04:36.308
The U.R.C. Will control
any device I choose.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.077
It's like getting
every doom device in one.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.279
[Laughing] [Alarm sounding]

04:40.281 --> 04:42.180
The intruder alarm!

04:44.251 --> 04:46.485
[Gasps] Worst times 10!

04:46.487 --> 04:50.055
My former cellmate,
frukal lukar.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.356
You mean that dweeb
who wanted a dollar

04:51.358 --> 04:53.525
from everyone or he'd
shut down the Internet?

04:53.527 --> 04:58.263
Do not underestimate the
annoyance factor, Shego.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.599
So, he really bugs you.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.501
To the Max. Now hide!

05:02.503 --> 05:08.840
[Whispering] Ok. We'll pretend we're
not here and maybe he'll leave.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.809

Maybe who will leave?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.811
Frukal.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.378
Ow!

05:13.380 --> 05:15.113
How did you get in?

05:15.115 --> 05:16.148
Eh, I figured I'd let him in.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.417
This is going to be fantastic!

05:18.419 --> 05:19.951
Just like old times.

05:19.953 --> 05:23.021
Oh, will you look at this?

05:23.023 --> 05:24.423
Look at this lab.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.492
I just had a basement
with an inflatable pool

05:27.494 --> 05:28.527
and snapping turtles.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.262
How did you
break out of prison?

05:30.264 --> 05:31.963
I didn't!
They let me go.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.132
They can do that?
I served my time,

05:34.134 --> 05:35.967
paid my debt to society.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.202
I'm a free man.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.303
And you came here?

05:38.305 --> 05:39.604
Yes, and here is why.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.506
I think with
the world famous Dr. Drakken

05:41.508 --> 05:44.376
as my mentor, I too
can be an achiever.

05:44.378 --> 05:47.479
Wait, you want
him to mentor you?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.314
I'm not mentoring anybody!

05:49.316 --> 05:51.016
So, you're available.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.485
Yeah... lukar,
personal space.

05:53.487 --> 05:58.256
Yeah, my dad's trying to get me
to become part of the system.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.224
Right.
Artie!

05:59.226 --> 06:00.492
Aw!
There you are.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.594
Gotta go, the man just arrived.

06:02.596 --> 06:06.398
No, the other man. The
doof who works for my dad.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.033
What are you doing here?

06:08.035 --> 06:09.868
Hey little nude dude!
Hello!

06:09.870 --> 06:11.536
You know, Artie,
I'm here to hang.

06:11.538 --> 06:15.307
To chill, to get to know
the Artie inside, the angry...

06:15.309 --> 06:18.377
too bad, so sad.
Wah wah wah.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.078
Huh?

06:20.881 --> 06:24.616
You've got a Bueno Nacho
in your house?!

06:24.618 --> 06:28.086
It's not.
Dad only got me one.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.654
The things
I have to put up with.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.523
You wouldn't understand.

06:31.525 --> 06:35.327
I...I don't.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.296
You know what else he likes?

06:38.298 --> 06:40.432
Ah, I've got a lot of those!

06:40.434 --> 06:46.438
And, oh! You know when you sort of
blow on him to get his attention?

06:47.608 --> 06:51.977
I've discovered
the location of the U.R.C.!

06:51.979 --> 06:52.911
Whatcha doing?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.313
Ultimate remote control.
Oh!

06:55.315 --> 06:57.282
Gonna use it for some big plot?

06:57.284 --> 07:00.685
Stop asking questions
and stop touching me!

07:00.687 --> 07:02.521

Huh... you see?

07:05.159 --> 07:06.391
Nice, huh?
What is this?

07:06.393 --> 07:07.325
Shego!

07:07.327 --> 07:11.496
What, stop blow... stop
blowing... stop blowing in my...

07:11.498 --> 07:13.532
what? Why are you?

07:13.534 --> 07:16.968
[Gasps] Ah, look
what you made me do!

07:16.970 --> 07:20.939
You know, just thinking out loud,
but if I had a controller like that

07:20.941 --> 07:22.407
I'd use it
on the new stockbots.

07:22.409 --> 07:28.246
It says that they've put in
stockbots in all their stores.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.382
Smarty mart, low ball...

07:30.384 --> 07:31.983
4,000 world wide.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.985
Did you say 4,000?

07:33.987 --> 07:34.986
World wide!

07:34.988 --> 07:36.588
With a new one
opening every week.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.989
This week, kawani.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.424
Kawani? Hmm.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.326
Under my control,
these stockbots

07:41.328 --> 07:43.528
will be a ready made
robot army!

07:43.530 --> 07:45.597
Robot army? Hello!

07:45.599 --> 07:48.567
Remember little diablo?
Big disaster.

07:48.569 --> 07:52.471
This time it's all
about market share.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.439
If I rule smarty mart,

07:54.441 --> 07:56.041
then I rule the world!

07:56.043 --> 07:59.478
Lukar, I might have
been wrong about you.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.446
This plan's a keeper!

08:01.448 --> 08:03.148
What? Oh, no.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.084
They're bonding!

08:08.689 --> 08:12.290
K.P., my smarty mart
career is over

08:12.292 --> 08:15.393
if I don't life coach
Artie out of brat-dom.

08:15.395 --> 08:18.029
[Watch beeping]
What's the sitch, Wade?

08:18.031 --> 08:20.165
Drakken, Shego,
and frukal lukar

08:20.167 --> 08:23.201
just stole the U.R.C.,
the ultimate remote control.

08:23.203 --> 08:27.072
But I'll let you know once I
triangulate where they're headed.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.340
Please, and thank you!

08:28.342 --> 08:29.541
[Rufus humming] Hmm.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.511
Artie seemed to like Rufus.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.645
I got it!

08:33.647 --> 08:35.247
I got to tell you, lukar.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.182
Wiz-bang effort
stealing this remote!

08:37.184 --> 08:39.484
You... you stop
right there, you!

08:39.486 --> 08:41.586
It's all due to your
brilliant coaching.

08:41.588 --> 08:44.022
Ah-ha-ha.
Hear that, Shego?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.724
I'm getting my props here.

08:45.726 --> 08:49.261
You should take a page
from lukar's book.

08:49.530 --> 08:53.565
So, this will control anything?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.501
[Yelling]

09:01.575 --> 09:05.477
Bad apprentice, bad!
No touching!

09:05.479 --> 09:06.745
It has to be programmed first.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.313
You're the genius, genius.

09:08.315 --> 09:11.349
Now, we break into the
smarty mart central office,

09:11.351 --> 09:14.386
transfer the stockbot data
into the U.R.C.,

09:14.388 --> 09:17.489
and then world conquest
will be mine!

09:17.491 --> 09:18.523
[Laughing]

09:18.525 --> 09:20.792
But first,
did you have breakfast?

09:20.794 --> 09:21.626
You know, I skipped.

09:21.628 --> 09:25.130
Let's call it brunch then.

09:25.331 --> 09:29.301
Welcome to the smarty mart
pet department!

09:29.303 --> 09:32.504
But with great pets
comes great responsibility,

09:32.506 --> 09:37.542
everybody's in cages, and you
know who builds stinky cages?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.511
[Sighs] The man?

09:39.513 --> 09:40.412
[Grunting]

09:40.414 --> 09:44.482
Hey, Stoppable, this crate was
shipped to housewares in error.

09:44.484 --> 09:48.353
