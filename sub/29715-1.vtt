00:00.434 --> 00:04.136
(film reel rolling)

00:09.744 --> 00:12.611
(intense instrumental music)

00:31.599 --> 00:34.600
(cinematic instrumental music)

00:34.602 --> 00:37.469
(men talking in background)

00:39.140 --> 00:40.139
(electronic scanner beeping)

00:40.141 --> 00:42.207
(door wooshing open)

00:42.209 --> 00:43.208
Commander: General, Sir.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.310
(electronic beeping)

00:45.746 --> 00:47.713
At ease Commander.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.548
(inaudible)

00:49.550 --> 00:51.116
How are we doing?

00:51.118 --> 00:52.651
We're making progress sir.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.587
486 runners and 23 healthy
ones this month.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.322
(men yelling in background)

00:57.324 --> 00:59.191
Keep up the
good work Commander.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.593
Find as many
healthy ones as possible.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.163
We need to get
them in quarantine.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.297
(electronic beeping)

01:05.299 --> 01:06.799
How about the resistance?

01:06.801 --> 01:09.435
Have you been able
to solve that problem?

01:09.437 --> 01:10.803
No General Sir,

01:10.805 --> 01:12.571
We managed to
exterminate some nests

01:12.573 --> 01:14.139
but the resistance is heavy

01:14.141 --> 01:15.641
and pretty well organized.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.476
Our intelligence was also
able to catch some fragments

01:17.478 --> 01:19.344
of the settler signal.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.814
It has something to do with
research through a cure.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.784
Whatever they're up to keep
me informed at all times.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.187
Find the nest Commander.

01:28.189 --> 01:31.223
They must be exterminated
as soon as possible.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.660
What if they found
a cure to, General?

01:36.363 --> 01:39.398
There's no such
thing Commander.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.300
Proceed to extermination.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.568
That's an order!

01:43.871 --> 01:45.204
Sir General Sir.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.872
(instrumental music)

01:46.874 --> 01:48.140
Dismissed.

01:49.810 --> 01:50.676
(hologram powers off)

01:52.279 --> 01:53.345
Renee: Hey

01:55.449 --> 01:56.782
How's the video
beacon doing?

01:58.119 --> 02:00.786
Snow: I ran some tests
and it seems to be fine

02:00.788 --> 02:02.521
but my worries are
with the jammers.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.358
- I thought you calculated it.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.860
You said it was fine.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.794
- Yeah I did.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.664
The big jammers have
a reach of 25 click.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.867
But the little ones are new.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.568
We don't know
anything about them.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.213
What if we take down
the main antenna?

02:30.851 --> 02:31.717
Take down.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.187
How do you wanna do that?

02:35.189 --> 02:36.522
- But,we...

02:36.524 --> 02:38.257
We have a network.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.260
Don't we have
anybody close by?

02:41.262 --> 02:41.927
- Let me see.

02:44.899 --> 02:48.267
We have insurgents
in section 5.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.769
They call themselves
the free fighters.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.841
But I wouldn't send them in
unless you really have to.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.842
- Why not?

02:56.844 --> 02:58.878
- Why not?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.913
Does the term insurgents
mean anything to you?

03:00.915 --> 03:03.615
It can jeopardize the whole
mission if they got caught.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.586
Renee: Aren't they
allied with us?

03:07.588 --> 03:09.388
- Yeah we exchange
stuff with them

03:09.390 --> 03:10.556
and they're on our side.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.623
- Who's their leader?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.693
His name is Vanguard.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.298
I'll pop him up on
the big screen.

03:19.300 --> 03:19.898
(chair rustling)

03:19.900 --> 03:21.667
There we go.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.239
(keyboard typing)

03:27.241 --> 03:28.640
Hello Vanguard.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.611
You know what?

03:33.948 --> 03:36.481
Send him a message
to stand by but

03:36.483 --> 03:37.983
don't tell him about
the mission just yet.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.556
I'm going for
the GPS okay?

03:44.558 --> 03:47.626
(footsteps)

03:50.397 --> 03:51.363
(knocking on door)

03:51.365 --> 03:53.565
(beeping)

03:53.567 --> 03:55.467
(sighing)

03:55.936 --> 03:57.769
Deena: Oh.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.339
You're not looking so hot.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.640
Have you been drinking?

04:01.642 --> 04:02.708
(door opens)

04:05.479 --> 04:07.613
(radio chatter)

04:07.615 --> 04:08.914
Tex: What do you want?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.816
Deena: There's a kid
in Transit 17.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.322
- Alright.

04:17.324 --> 04:18.841
(radio chatter)

04:18.841 --> 04:20.358
We find surviving kids now
and then don't we?

04:20.361 --> 04:21.627
Deena: So they can
make a vaccine.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.295
- Bullshit

04:23.297 --> 04:24.763
They've been searching
for years now.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.198
You know what I think?

04:26.199 --> 04:27.632
I think Rats and
Kosami's behind it.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.867
They're smart.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.535
They know we have
to cross their path.

04:30.537 --> 04:31.737
- They're not smart enough.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.841
I found a new way
to the other side.

04:35.843 --> 04:39.311
It's tricky but
it's not impossible.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.946
Take a look at this.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.014
- What is it?

04:42.016 --> 04:43.382
- See for yourself.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.456
So?

04:51.458 --> 04:52.858
- Look at the corners.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.593
- Sewers.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.663
Where did you find that?

04:57.665 --> 04:58.664
(radio chatter)

04:58.666 --> 04:59.665
I'll tell you later.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.366
Shouldn't we get
to work now?

05:04.071 --> 05:06.405
Yeah. But I think I
better go talk to

05:06.407 --> 05:07.706
Robert now.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.741
Deena: Yep, you should.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.680
(computers beeping)

05:14.682 --> 05:16.515
Hey Tex. Got my brief?

05:16.517 --> 05:18.684
Tex: Yeah I got your brief.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.319
Would you guys
give us a minute?

05:20.321 --> 05:20.986
(computers beeping)

05:25.993 --> 05:27.659
Transit 17.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.528
Have you lost
your freaking mind?

05:29.530 --> 05:30.996
You're my best team Tex.

05:30.998 --> 05:31.997
- Screw that Robert!

05:31.999 --> 05:33.732
It's a trap. Open your eyes!

05:33.734 --> 05:35.534
No it's a verified source
there's no doubt.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.535
- Screw that source to!

05:36.537 --> 05:37.736
You want to get us killed?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.738
- Look I know you've
been through a lot.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.440
I got a hunch about this.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.407
What if it's our only chance?

05:42.409 --> 05:43.608
I don't want to blow it!

05:43.610 --> 05:45.377
Tex: It's going to
be a massacre.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.746
I just want you to
know, a massacre!

05:47.748 --> 05:50.449
Robert: Oh, so you didn't
swear to this cause.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.617
Tex you're the team leader.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.752
You don't want to do this?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.554
Fine. I'll pull you
out right now.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.022
Tex: Pull me out?

05:57.024 --> 05:58.690
You don't get it do you?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.359
I don't care for my life anymore

06:00.361 --> 06:01.893
but my team deserves
a lot better!

06:01.895 --> 06:03.562
1800 hours.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.831
I'm holding a briefing and
I want everyone there

06:05.833 --> 06:07.466
to make sure we're
on the same page.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.900
Tex: You really want to
give up the best team

06:08.902 --> 06:10.135
That you ever had?

06:10.137 --> 06:11.570
For a tail?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.071
You take him
out there Tex.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.639
I'm not giving
anything up.

06:15.909 --> 06:16.908
And I got your back.

06:16.910 --> 06:17.976
(computers beeping)

06:19.446 --> 06:20.946
It's up to you alright?

06:20.948 --> 06:21.947
1800 hours.

06:21.949 --> 06:22.948
Dismissed.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.916
(computers beeping)

06:24.918 --> 06:27.486
(footsteps)

06:27.488 --> 06:30.522
(intense instrumental music)

06:35.596 --> 06:38.864
(grunting)

06:40.901 --> 06:42.467
Morning.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.069
Tex: Morning Corporal.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.071
Don't you ever get
tired of that shit?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.172
(grunting)

06:47.174 --> 06:48.874
- Someone's got to stay
fit around here.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.142
- Have you seen
Daniel around?

06:50.144 --> 06:52.711
- Sure. He's fixing the pig.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.147
(grunting)

06:55.149 --> 06:56.148
Fuck.

06:56.150 --> 06:58.950
(grunting)

07:06.160 --> 07:07.159
(knocking on door)

07:07.161 --> 07:08.026
Tex: Daniel.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.629
Daniel: Tex?

07:10.631 --> 07:11.696
Tex: We need to talk.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.699
Daniel: Good to see you.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.975
You wanna talk?

07:23.977 --> 07:25.677
Is there anything
I need to know?

07:25.679 --> 07:27.879
So I guess Robert has
told you about the kid right?

07:27.881 --> 07:30.515
Since when are you guys deciding
things behind my back?

07:30.517 --> 07:31.183
It wasn't like that.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.553
You were the one who
wanted to be left alone.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.855
So we thought it was better for
you to hear it from Robert.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.558
Yeah but you guys believe
in this, don't you?

07:39.560 --> 07:40.158
You really wanna know?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.560
Yeah we do.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.561
Is it worth your life to?

07:42.563 --> 07:43.728
(drilling and hammering)

07:43.730 --> 07:44.963
Come on Tex, what life?

07:44.965 --> 07:48.633
That vaccine can give
us a second chance.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.685
To all of us.

07:50.686 --> 07:52.736
Anything, and I mean anything
is better than this shitty life.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.606
Maybe you're right.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.976
Maybe it is time
for a change.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.845
Does that mean you're
going to come with us?

07:59.847 --> 08:01.880
Tex: What the hell do you
think, I would let you

08:01.882 --> 08:02.981
guys go alone?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.549
You're dead before
you get there!

08:06.520 --> 08:08.820
I appreciate that Tex.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.155
It's the right decision.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.823
When are you guys
planning to leave?

08:11.825 --> 08:14.893
(soldering in background)

08:15.996 --> 08:17.696
The longer we wait.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.763
I mean.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.067
We can't waste anymore time.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.236
Robert will give us the
intel so,

08:24.238 --> 08:25.570
How about tonight?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.075
Alright.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.210
Tonight it will be.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.179
But remember one thing Daniel.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.947
People will die.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.554
(footsteps)

08:42.556 --> 08:43.221
Eve: How are
you doing?

08:45.559 --> 08:47.192
I'm good.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.094
How's your day been?

08:49.096 --> 08:51.963
Yeah, seems like everyone's
avoiding me today.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.449
(laughs)

08:54.450 --> 08:55.833
Well, that's because
you're scary.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.569
What did you just say?

08:57.571 --> 08:59.304
(laughs)

08:59.306 --> 09:00.305
See what I mean?

09:00.307 --> 09:01.606
Short fuse.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.742
Yeah well, Tex is the same.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.243
Tex has got a
lot on his mind.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.245
You know, don't worry about him.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.847
He'll come around.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.215
Do you think we're
going to make this trip?

09:12.219 --> 09:13.652
No.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.954
I'm with Tex, you know,
I think it's too big.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.623
For just us.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.126
You know we got the pig,
which is pretty solid.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.962
You know it's old.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.765
As long as we get past
that outpost on the West side.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.134
Robert thinks we can do it.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.203
With all due respect Eve,

09:32.205 --> 09:34.205
Roberts a dinosaur.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.074
He's been out of the
field for far too long.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.145
I don't get it I mean.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.115
What's the point of being
in this organization

09:44.117 --> 09:45.650
if we're not going
to make a difference.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.019
My thoughts exactly.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.021
and, I guess.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.691
That's what I'm
here to find out.

09:53.827 --> 09:54.826
Well.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.027
(items shuffling)

09:56.029 --> 09:57.996
You're going to find
out soon enough.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.866
(footsteps)

10:01.868 --> 10:03.201
Robert: Alright good evening.

10:04.338 --> 10:05.904
I see everyone's here.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.005
Good job Tex.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.560
Alright first things first.

10:11.561 --> 10:12.811
If anyone here wants
out of this operation

10:12.813 --> 10:14.279
I want to hear from
you right now.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.015
(computers beeping)

10:19.152 --> 10:20.018
Okay.

10:21.688 --> 10:22.954
We're here, headquarters.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.290
Transit 17 is 75 clicks away

10:25.292 --> 10:26.992
another hundred
clicks to the coast.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.259
and the first checkpoint.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.761
Okay?

10:29.762 --> 10:31.262
Renee will fill you
in with the details.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.334
Uh, oh, okay.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.303
Uh, so.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.038
Uh, if, if

10:40.040 --> 10:41.840
you wanna
surviving this trip

10:41.842 --> 10:43.308
there are a few
rules you gotta follow.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.227
Um.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.145
We want to avoid
highways and main roads

10:47.147 --> 10:48.213
they're full of car wrecks.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.681
We?

10:49.683 --> 10:51.683
What do you mean we?

10:52.686 --> 10:53.985
Are you tagging
along with us?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.320
Excuse me?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.721
(laughs)

10:56.723 --> 10:57.956
Uh, no, um, um.

10:57.958 --> 10:58.957
(laughs)

10:58.959 --> 11:00.158
At the computer.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.426
All right, can we move on?

11:02.062 --> 11:04.229
Okay, um.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.831
I've uploaded a route
to your GPS which

11:06.833 --> 11:08.166
takes you along the forest.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.101
We'll give you cover
during the day.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.371
If you need to change course,

11:13.373 --> 11:15.206
avoid the city of Brouge it's

11:15.208 --> 11:17.175
full of sniffers over there.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.077
They're still pretty
much active.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.745
Um.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.747
If you run into some troubles,

11:22.749 --> 11:26.117
try to hide yourself and the
Pig in some abandoned place.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.887
Snow and I will be providing
you technical support

11:28.889 --> 11:30.021
for the next 36 hours

11:30.023 --> 11:33.391
but we are running
into some issues.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.727
Um, she will explain.

11:35.729 --> 11:36.728
Snow will explain.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.814
(computers beeping)

11:38.815 --> 11:40.899
Snow: Right the sniffers have
a network of jammers

11:40.901 --> 11:43.101
that can disturb our
signal from time to time.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.204
We calculated the
route to avoid them

11:46.206 --> 11:47.839
but there are no guarantees.

11:49.443 --> 11:50.975
So where's the rendezvous?

11:51.812 --> 11:53.278
That's a very
good question.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.779
Once you get on Wevrick

11:54.781 --> 11:56.047
Um

11:56.049 --> 11:59.818
head to Polar street 46 where
you'll meet with your contact.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.352
He will then take you
directly to the RC

12:01.354 --> 12:02.787
where he will hand
her over to you.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.155
Her?

12:04.157 --> 12:05.924
I thought we were
talking about a kid.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.492
Well actually she is.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.728
She's only 15.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.030
(computers beeping)

12:12.032 --> 12:14.265
Alright, once you
pick up the girl

12:14.267 --> 12:16.768
you bring her
directly to the coast.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.403
Okay, the next checkpoint.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.938
For the crossing.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.308
Wait a minute.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.376
No one can cross the water,
we all know that.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.078
No, not on the surface.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.313
We're taking a mini sub.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.449
Who can afford a submarine?

12:31.451 --> 12:34.753
Look this girls father is one o
most influential and wealthiest

12:34.755 --> 12:36.287
people in the UK alright?

12:36.289 --> 12:38.389
So we're just
smuggling a rich kid.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.958
Oh wha, hey!

12:39.960 --> 12:41.392
That wasn't part of the deal.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.260
Is that it?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.797
Look, the fact
that he's wealthy

12:45.799 --> 12:47.132
is to our advantage.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.133
I mean.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.001
Because of him,

12:50.003 --> 12:51.770
he can not only
pay for the operation

12:51.772 --> 12:53.071
but maybe pay the lab
rats to come up

12:53.073 --> 12:54.472
with some kind of vaccine.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.474
And if that happens you'll
not only be thankful

12:56.476 --> 12:57.542
you'll be a hero.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.879
Wait. This changes the
whole fucking mission.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.082
Shouldn't you have told us
this shit in the first place?

13:04.084 --> 13:05.283
Yeah, you should.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.254
Alright just,
alright alright alright.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.289
Just hold on okay look,

13:11.291 --> 13:13.792
you know this girl has lived
among us for seven years

13:13.794 --> 13:15.827
now she knows
what hell is alright?

13:15.829 --> 13:18.363
So we just have to
trust Darcy just like that?

13:19.866 --> 13:21.099
The decision is
going to be yours

13:21.101 --> 13:23.201
alright so let's
see what we got.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.202
(computer beeping)

13:24.204 --> 13:25.537
Brad?

13:25.539 --> 13:27.238
You're the boss.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.240
If you're in then I
guess I am to.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.009
Alright.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.010
Eve?

13:32.012 --> 13:33.077
(computers beeping)

13:33.880 --> 13:35.246
Yeah, whatever.

13:35.849 --> 13:36.915
Deena?

13:39.019 --> 13:40.385
Yeah, I guess.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.887
Daniel?

13:42.889 --> 13:44.389
Already made my decision.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.524
I'm going.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.864
Alright, Tex.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.365
You're in charge now.

13:55.902 --> 13:59.237
(garage door opening)

13:59.239 --> 14:01.973
(engine humming)

14:04.244 --> 14:05.877
(truck drives away)

14:05.879 --> 14:08.913
(engine rattling)

14:17.324 --> 14:18.389
(radio static)

14:20.227 --> 14:21.059
(computer beeping)

14:21.061 --> 14:22.060
Hey.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.728
You okay?

14:23.729 --> 14:25.395
Yeah, I've just got a really
bad feeling about this.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.598
(computers beeping)

14:27.901 --> 14:29.500
You worry too much Brad.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.536
That's because I know exactly
what's around the corner.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.304
We don't.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.274
I'm not saying that.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.076
I'm just saying you two girls
take this for granted.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.311
(computers beeping)

14:43.450 --> 14:46.317
Hey I wonder how much
it's changed out there.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.287
I mean, we have haven't
been on the other side for,

14:49.289 --> 14:50.288
ages.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.457
(computer beeping)

14:52.459 --> 14:54.325
According to recent reports,

14:54.327 --> 14:57.328
60 million people have been
infected in the last seven year.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.198
Wow, that's a lot
of them out there.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.201
There aren't so
many anymore.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.936
They said Reszingers
army killed

15:04.938 --> 15:06.204
at least three
quarter of them.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.172
(engine revving)

15:09.009 --> 15:11.175
Renee: Alpha team this
is HQ do you copy?

15:11.177 --> 15:12.610
Tex over radio:
Copy go ahead HQ.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.013
You're approaching
a wasteland.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.515
Keep an eye out for scraps
and junks if you don't mind.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.217
Tex over radio:
Copy that.

15:19.986 --> 15:24.222
(engine revving)

15:28.595 --> 15:29.594
(loud thud)

15:29.596 --> 15:31.629
(computer beeping fast)

15:31.631 --> 15:33.998
Tex what the fuck?!

15:34.000 --> 15:34.999
(beeping stops)

15:35.001 --> 15:36.568
Nothing guys.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.136
Just bumped into a car
but we're still rolling.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.640
Heads up next time please.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.443
Tex on radio:
I'll keep it in mind.

15:47.113 --> 15:51.582
(engine revving slowly)

15:51.584 --> 15:55.486
(suspenseful instrumental music)

16:01.161 --> 16:03.728
(computer beeping fast)

16:03.730 --> 16:04.996
Oh fuck!

16:07.200 --> 16:09.000
The temperature
is going up.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.702
It's the radiator.

16:12.038 --> 16:12.670
I think it's leaking again.

16:12.672 --> 16:13.705
We have to make a stop.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.341
What now?

16:16.343 --> 16:17.675
We're never going to
make it in time.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.160
We need to fix it.

16:19.161 --> 16:20.644
Otherwise we're going
to blow up the engine.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.513
That's not good.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.583
We gotta get out of the
pig one way or another.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.985
It's the only way
we can fix this.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.052
Deena: Hmm

16:28.355 --> 16:29.554
(computer beeping fast)

16:29.556 --> 16:32.190
Alpha team to headquarters
do you copy?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.258
Alpha team I hear you
loud and clear over.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.195
The Pig is in trouble.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.697
We need to make
a stop to fix it.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.200
A house near by, something
with a barn or a garage.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.201
- Okay.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.635
(keyboard typing fast)

16:44.637 --> 16:45.570
Just give me a minute.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.008
Tex on radio:
Okay guys I got a visual.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.110
Brad did you brought
your tools with you?

16:52.679 --> 16:53.544
Yeah I've got them here.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.382
Alpha team there is a
house on Oak street 15.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.250
Just a few clicks ahead of you.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.885
Tex on radio:
Good job Renee.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.519
It used to be a repair shop
performing equipment

17:02.522 --> 17:03.688
so you might be able to find

17:03.690 --> 17:05.356
some tools you
can use in there.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.758
Tex on radio:
Copy that.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.426
Not sure if the owner
survived the outbreak though.

17:09.429 --> 17:13.564
But I guess you figure that
out directly on the spot.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.066
We're heading towards it.

17:15.068 --> 17:15.733
You're the man.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.435
Um, just be careful guys.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.271
There's still some
activity out there.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.407
Although I'm not
sure what it is.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.278
(motors whirring)

17:29.549 --> 17:32.250
Alpha team this is HQ
again do you copy over?

17:33.286 --> 17:35.119
Renee can you hear me

17:35.121 --> 17:37.121
(radio static)

17:37.123 --> 17:39.624
Alpha team to headquarters
do you copy?

17:39.626 --> 17:40.491
(radio static)

17:41.795 --> 17:42.794
(radio static and studdering)

17:42.796 --> 17:44.228
I didn't catch that Daniel.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.296
You're breaking up.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.566
Daniel?

17:48.568 --> 17:49.567
(radio static and beeping)

17:49.569 --> 17:51.269
Shit we lost contact.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.237
Uh, damn it.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.238
(radio static and beeping)

17:54.240 --> 17:57.108
Alpha team do you copy?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.310
Shit!

18:03.850 --> 18:06.584
(motors whirring)

18:08.321 --> 18:11.322
(suspenseful instrumental music)

18:15.428 --> 18:17.361
(keyboard typing)

18:17.363 --> 18:18.496
Robert: Where are they?

18:18.498 --> 18:20.298
Look I need a
visual Renee.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.132
Can you get it back?

18:21.134 --> 18:22.100
I'm doing all I can sir.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.534
(keyboard typing)

18:23.536 --> 18:25.169
I'm still receiving
a transmission

18:25.171 --> 18:26.637
from within that zone.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.140
But as expected a jammer
is disrupting the signal.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.142
(keyboard typing)

18:31.611 --> 18:33.511
Alpha team do
you copy over?

18:34.781 --> 18:35.847
Tex?

18:36.483 --> 18:37.548
Daniel?

18:38.151 --> 18:39.484
Copy over.

18:39.486 --> 18:42.153
(radio static)

18:44.357 --> 18:45.356
(computer beeping)

18:45.358 --> 18:46.657
Robert: Wait!

18:46.659 --> 18:47.725
I'm getting something.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.696
Alpha team this is
Robert do you copy over?

18:51.698 --> 18:53.631
(computer beeping)

18:53.633 --> 18:55.266
God! Shit!

19:02.308 --> 19:03.307
(sigh)

19:03.309 --> 19:04.375
What now?

19:06.546 --> 19:08.880
Sir, we can send
in the free fighters.

19:12.185 --> 19:12.850
They're ready.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.390
Alright, so uh.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.160
So what if we take
down the antenna?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.464
Will that work?

19:26.465 --> 19:27.431
Yes it will.
At least for a while.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.866
Alright take it down.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.368
I want full recon.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.170
Tell me when you
get any news at all.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.171
Renee: Absolutely.

19:33.173 --> 19:33.838
Snow: Of course sir.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.607
(crickets chirping)

19:47.187 --> 19:48.753
Daniel: Tex.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.221
Should Brad and me
go for the garage?

19:51.357 --> 19:53.491
All right Brad,
roll in the Pig.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.259
Daniel will back you up.

19:55.795 --> 19:56.861
Okay.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.730
Eve, Deena,
you're with me.

19:59.732 --> 20:00.598
Secure the house.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.679
(engine starting up)

(footsteps)

20:32.565 --> 20:33.931
(breathing heavily)

20:33.933 --> 20:34.932
Alright.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.300
Let's see what's in here.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.736
It's getting close to dawn.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.605
Might have to spend
some time in here.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.240
We don't know how
long it's going to take

20:42.242 --> 20:43.507
to repair the Pig do we?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.426
We're going upstairs.

20:45.427 --> 20:46.443
Deena you take the right flank.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.245
Deena: Copy that.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.914
(footsteps)

21:00.627 --> 21:01.692
Cozy

21:09.836 --> 21:11.669

21:14.307 --> 21:16.374

22:33.486 --> 22:35.753

23:21.434 --> 23:22.900
(door opening)

23:22.902 --> 23:23.901

23:23.903 --> 23:26.036

(screaming and groaning)

23:56.803 --> 23:58.202
(loud groaning)

23:58.203 --> 23:59.602
Tex: Shit we got a
whole bunch of them.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.972

24:01.974 --> 24:06.010

24:41.013 --> 24:42.079
(grunting)

24:44.517 --> 24:46.150
(reloading weapon)

24:46.152 --> 24:47.551
Well done.

24:47.553 --> 24:48.819
Let's go check on Deena.

24:48.821 --> 24:49.820
Come on.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.888
(groaning)

24:51.691 --> 24:55.059
(groaning)

24:55.828 --> 24:56.894

(heavy breathing)

25:05.705 --> 25:06.704
(footsteps)

25:06.706 --> 25:07.705
Tex: Woah.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.173
It's us.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.274
Okay?

25:10.276 --> 25:11.642
Calm down.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.877
(heavy breathing)

25:12.879 --> 25:13.911
Tex: Are you alright?

25:13.913 --> 25:16.914
(heavy breathing)

25:16.916 --> 25:18.549
Son of a bitch
almost got me.

25:18.551 --> 25:19.950
(heavy breathing)

25:22.188 --> 25:23.187
Have you been bitten?

25:23.189 --> 25:24.722
No.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.723
I'm good.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.259
(heavy breathing)

25:32.665 --> 25:33.731
Are you sure?

25:37.837 --> 25:38.836
What?

25:38.838 --> 25:41.071
(heavy breathing)

25:41.073 --> 25:42.606
Why are you staring
at me like that?

25:44.777 --> 25:46.610
Are you sure you
haven't been bitten?

25:46.612 --> 25:47.278
I said I was good.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.751
Okay.

25:54.587 --> 25:55.653
Alright.

25:56.556 --> 25:57.221
If you're good
you're good.

25:58.724 --> 25:59.723
Okay.

25:59.725 --> 26:00.791
Calm down.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.095
Daniel. It's Tex.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.731
I'm here.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.935
We had a few runners
but we're fine now.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.237
We gotta lock
ourselves in here.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.305
How are you
guys doing?

26:14.307 --> 26:15.706
(tools rattling)

26:15.708 --> 26:17.608
Yeah we had a runner to.

26:17.610 --> 26:18.976
Brad took care of him.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.245
He's back on the job now.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.846
Tex over radio:
Got any idea how long

26:22.848 --> 26:24.048
it's gonna take?

26:24.050 --> 26:25.115
Yo Brad.

26:25.785 --> 26:26.984
How long this
is gonna take?

26:29.755 --> 26:30.988
How the hell do I know?

26:31.791 --> 26:33.157
Don't even know if
it can be fixed yet.

26:34.126 --> 26:34.992
(sigh)

26:36.262 --> 26:37.261
Tex.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.129
I think at least a few hours.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.798
Give us a sign
when you're done.

26:40.800 --> 26:41.966
Daniel over radio:
Copy that.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.033
Are we stuck?

26:44.136 --> 26:45.603
Yeah.

26:45.605 --> 26:46.804
Let's get settled.

26:55.114 --> 26:58.315
(somber instrumental music)

27:01.821 --> 27:06.357
(suspenseful instrumental music)

27:12.098 --> 27:13.263
Alright guys.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.665
Get ready.

27:14.667 --> 27:15.332
Let's do this.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.202
We're not going Vanguard.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.173
What do you mean
we're not going?

27:23.409 --> 27:25.275
We had a deal.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.677
No you had a deal!

27:29.115 --> 27:30.064
Yeah.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.014
Why don't they
clean up their own shit?

27:31.017 --> 27:33.150
We don't even know
what it's about.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.853
Give us a good reason why
we should go and do this.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.021
You want a reason?

27:37.023 --> 27:38.088
I give you three.

27:38.891 --> 27:41.325
Within 14 days we
run out of beer,

27:41.327 --> 27:43.027
food and cigarettes.

27:43.963 --> 27:46.363
If it's a no go,
they won't forget.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.231
Got it?

27:48.834 --> 27:50.200
Woman: That's enough guys.

27:51.704 --> 27:52.369
Wanna come?

27:53.739 --> 27:55.372
(engine starting)

27:55.374 --> 27:56.974
Think about it.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.243
(engine humming)

28:05.084 --> 28:08.385
Man: Sorry, I can do
without my cigarettes.

28:08.387 --> 28:11.121
(engine humming)

28:15.761 --> 28:17.161
Come on Reese.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.096
Let's get this done.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.184
Eve: hey.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.185
Deena: Geez

28:41.187 --> 28:42.186
Scared the shit out of me.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.253
Eve: Sorry it's just me.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.723
Deena: Yeah.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.424
Just cleaning up a bit.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.959
You look exhausted.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.260
You should get some rest.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.328
Deena: I'm fine.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.467
Here.

29:04.777 --> 29:05.776
Deena: No!

29:05.778 --> 29:06.844
(heavy breathing)

29:08.914 --> 29:10.314
Deena, is something wrong?

29:11.150 --> 29:12.282
Is there something
you're not telling me?

29:14.920 --> 29:17.287
I was just thinking about
something from the past.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.259
Eve: Is it your brother?

29:23.295 --> 29:24.161
Deena: I miss him.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.297
If he was here he'd be
one of us you know?

29:28.134 --> 29:29.133
Eve: Hmm

29:29.135 --> 29:30.200
I'm sure he would.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.338
Do you know what Deena?

29:36.041 --> 29:37.241
We've all got our demons.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.277
So why don't you
just get some rest.

29:40.913 --> 29:41.979
It'll do you good.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.315
(footsteps)

29:47.119 --> 29:48.118
(sigh)

29:48.120 --> 29:49.186
I'll try.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.490
(computers beeping)

29:57.096 --> 29:59.329
Vanguard and his
team are operating.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.467
Good.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.205
(yawning)

30:10.142 --> 30:11.208
(sigh)

30:12.478 --> 30:15.012
I'm gonna need
some fresh air.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.547
And a smoke.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.284
Snow can you cover
for me for a sec?

30:20.286 --> 30:22.820
Sure but don't stay
away for too long okay?

30:22.822 --> 30:24.321
Renee: Okay.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.323
I'll be back
in a flash baby.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.193
And don't call me baby, got it!

30:29.595 --> 30:30.861
Renee: Yes maam.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.263
Dumb ass.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.331
(computers beeping)

30:35.367 --> 30:38.836
(suspenseful instrumental music)

30:38.838 --> 30:41.872
(crickets chirping)

30:41.874 --> 30:44.208
(howling in distance)

30:47.546 --> 30:49.513
(owl calling)

30:49.515 --> 30:51.582
(gun loads)

30:52.518 --> 30:54.284
(inaudible radio chatter)

31:05.364 --> 31:06.363
Alright men.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.231
Talk to me.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.567
(branches rustling)

31:10.569 --> 31:11.435
In position.

31:12.404 --> 31:13.403
I got one.

31:15.941 --> 31:16.440
Should I take him out?

31:16.441 --> 31:16.940
Vanguard over radio:
No.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.075
Hold your fire.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.142
Wait on my mark.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.347
I got one sniffer
at 4 O'clock.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.915
Clarisse you can
take him out quiet.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.451
(inaudible radio chatter)

31:28.420 --> 31:29.586
I'll take that bastard.

31:30.589 --> 31:31.455
(inaudible radio chatter)

31:38.664 --> 31:39.663
(grunt)

31:39.665 --> 31:41.565
(neck snapping)

31:41.567 --> 31:43.300
(crickets chirping)

31:45.671 --> 31:46.937
Well done.

31:47.439 --> 31:48.572
Merv go.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.656
Set to blow.

32:07.426 --> 32:08.425
Good job.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.426
Get the hell out.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.494
It's gonna get hot.

32:12.064 --> 32:14.331
(inaudible radio chatter)

32:24.643 --> 32:27.044
Okay. Let's fry
these bastards.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.580
(explosion)

32:30.582 --> 32:32.582
(gunshots)

32:32.584 --> 32:33.617
(yelling)

32:33.619 --> 32:35.519
(gunshots)

32:40.159 --> 32:41.525
(explosion)

32:43.262 --> 32:47.497
(fire crackling)

32:52.071 --> 32:54.104
(metal rattling)

32:54.106 --> 32:56.373
(suspenseful instrumental music)

33:05.150 --> 33:07.250
Is it done?

33:07.252 --> 33:09.219
Alright, wake up Deena.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.188
Eve: Deena.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.193
Eve: Deena.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.765
(loud groaning)

33:21.767 --> 33:22.733
(grunts)

33:22.735 --> 33:24.134
Get her off me.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.135
Tex: What the fuck?

33:25.137 --> 33:25.736
Eve: Fucking shoot her!

33:25.738 --> 33:27.304
(loud groaning)

33:27.306 --> 33:29.106
(yelling)

33:29.108 --> 33:30.173
(gunshot)

33:31.043 --> 33:33.176
(heavy breathing)

33:33.178 --> 33:34.177
Shit.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.380
(heavy breathing)

33:36.382 --> 33:37.447
(sigh)

33:38.484 --> 33:39.549
Fuck me.

33:43.522 --> 33:44.388
Are you okay?

33:45.758 --> 33:47.024
Yeah.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.262
(sigh)

34:04.209 --> 34:05.208
(heavy breathing)

34:05.210 --> 34:07.377
That was me.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.212
Deena's wasted.

34:09.214 --> 34:11.081
No just stay with the Pig.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.149
Give us a sec.

34:22.293 --> 34:25.362
(chords instrumental music)

34:25.364 --> 34:28.697
(machines whirring)

34:28.699 --> 34:31.101
(footsteps)

34:31.103 --> 34:34.404
(computers beeping)

34:34.406 --> 34:36.606
(machines whirring)

34:37.242 --> 34:38.308
What happened?

34:40.679 --> 34:42.312
Can't believe
we've lost her.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.652
She must have gotten
infected somehow.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.190
It's not your fault.

34:55.561 --> 34:57.294
These things happen
in the blink of an eye.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.764
(computers beeping)

35:00.766 --> 35:02.466
You can't blame yourself.

35:04.136 --> 35:07.537
(radio static)

35:10.742 --> 35:11.808
Yeah.

35:19.818 --> 35:23.487
(banging)

35:25.324 --> 35:27.691
(engine starting)

35:38.670 --> 35:39.536
Did she suffer?

35:45.310 --> 35:46.877
She turned in her sleep.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.214
That runner must have
got her at the attic.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.295
Eve woke her up.

36:05.297 --> 36:07.430
And she attacked her.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.572
Man.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.343
Should have seen her face.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.416
God.

36:28.187 --> 36:29.586
I hate this virus.

36:32.357 --> 36:33.723
We all do.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.263
Look Tex,
I don't want to but.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.601
We have to get back
to the task at hand.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.875
Let's get the damn girl
and get this over with.

36:54.246 --> 36:57.447
(inaudible radio chatter)

37:04.756 --> 37:08.758
(engine humming)

37:11.697 --> 37:14.464
HQ this is alpha
team do you copy?

37:14.733 --> 37:17.400
HQ this is alpha

37:20.672 --> 37:23.240

37:27.579 --> 37:29.879
Alpha team are you there?

37:29.881 --> 37:32.916

hear you again.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.417
What the hell happened.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.019
(laugh)

37:36.021 --> 37:36.886
Thank God!

37:38.423 --> 37:40.624
We lost the signal because
of the jammers but

37:40.626 --> 37:42.259
the free fighters
took care of that.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.960
Are you okay?

37:43.962 --> 37:46.296
Yeah the Pig is up
and running again.

37:46.298 --> 37:47.931
Brad and Daniel
took care of it.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.801
Thank God guys!

37:51.803 --> 37:53.703
We have some
bad news to Renee.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.273
We lost Deena.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.941
She got infected
during the night.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.444
(computers beeping)

38:03.282 --> 38:05.015
(engine humming)

38:05.017 --> 38:06.283
Renee?

38:07.052 --> 38:08.318
Still there?

38:09.454 --> 38:11.288
How did it happen?

38:12.557 --> 38:13.556
Look Renee.

38:13.558 --> 38:14.891
We're approaching the trespass

38:14.893 --> 38:16.359
we don't have time
to explain now.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.362
I'm going to need some
assistance with the bee.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.664
Are you up to this?

38:23.335 --> 38:24.401
Yeah, um.

38:25.437 --> 38:26.503
Okay.

38:28.307 --> 38:29.839
Don't worry guys
we're here.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.341
Um.

38:31.343 --> 38:32.876
Or at least until the
connection holds up.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.680
All right, gonna
contact you inside.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.415
Stay tuned.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.416
Copy.

38:39.418 --> 38:42.719
(computers beeping)

38:46.491 --> 38:49.492
(engine humming)

38:49.494 --> 38:52.362
(intense instrumental music)

38:55.033 --> 38:59.536
(birds chirping)

38:59.538 --> 39:00.537
Alright Daniel.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.405
What do we got?

39:02.407 --> 39:04.040
I got two sniffers
on the bridge.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.575
And three on the ground.

39:06.845 --> 39:07.911
Alright I'll call Renee.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.715
Renee it's Tex
do you copy?

39:11.717 --> 39:13.917
Renee this is Tex,
I need some intel.

39:14.553 --> 39:15.618
Renee: Copy that.

39:16.555 --> 39:17.921
We gonna let the bee up.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.689
Uh.

39:19.691 --> 39:20.690
Copy that.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.758
Go ahead.

39:23.528 --> 39:26.763
(machine powering up)

39:33.672 --> 39:34.738
Okay.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.741
Sensors are picking
up six signals

39:37.743 --> 39:39.142
but it's not strong enough.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.009
There could be more.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.881
(computers beeping)

39:45.517 --> 39:47.417
(birds chirping)

39:47.419 --> 39:49.386
Alright bring the
bee back in Renee.

39:49.388 --> 39:50.553
I'll get back to
you later on.

39:52.391 --> 39:53.590
Guys.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.024
Can you come
over here for a sec

39:55.026 --> 39:56.793
I want to explain how
we're gonna do this.

39:58.397 --> 39:59.529
Alright

39:59.531 --> 40:00.597
Daniel.

40:01.566 --> 40:02.899
You see that
spot over here?

40:03.435 --> 40:04.901
- Yeah.
- I want your ass up there.

40:04.903 --> 40:05.902
Can you do that?

40:05.904 --> 40:06.903
No problem.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.338
Okay.

40:08.339 --> 40:09.772
I'm going to take position
right over here.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.659
In the mean time

40:12.660 --> 40:13.909
Eve and Brad you guys
cut around the back.

40:13.912 --> 40:14.911
Double check the perimeter

40:14.913 --> 40:16.045
and wait for my signal.

40:16.047 --> 40:17.614
On my mark

40:17.616 --> 40:19.649
you take out the two sniffers a
the entrance over here.

40:20.752 --> 40:24.954
In the mean time Daniel and me
will got your asses covered.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.923
Once you're inside you
gotta speed up guys.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.792
Take out all
that's in there.

40:28.794 --> 40:31.795
Do it as silent as possible
before they can sound the alert.

40:32.431 --> 40:34.431
Once you're in,

40:34.432 --> 40:36.432
give us the signals so we can
take out the others outside.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.034
Okay are we good?

40:38.036 --> 40:38.902
Copy.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.037
Solid, let's go.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.138
Tex: Wait a minute guys.

40:43.909 --> 40:45.508
I wanna explain
something here.

40:46.611 --> 40:47.911
There's only four
of us left now.

40:49.214 --> 40:50.780
What I mean is
that we can still

40:50.782 --> 40:52.449
abort the mission
and go back.

40:52.451 --> 40:53.716
It's all up to you guys.

40:53.718 --> 40:54.717
No. No chance.

40:54.719 --> 40:55.718
Let's go.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.786
Tex: Okay.

40:57.956 --> 40:58.822
(suspense music)

41:04.463 --> 41:07.130
(running footsteps)

41:17.676 --> 41:20.743
(running footsteps)

41:22.981 --> 41:24.331
(keyboard clicking)

41:24.332 --> 41:25.682
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

41:25.684 --> 41:26.883
Oh shit!

41:32.090 --> 41:33.990
This is really getting
out of hand now.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.264
- [Tex Through Radio]
All right then,

41:41.266 --> 41:42.532
I'll go in from the main gate

41:42.534 --> 41:44.701
where you keep them busy.

41:44.703 --> 41:47.837
Once it's open, we'll
get back to the Pig.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.907
(running footsteps)

41:54.513 --> 41:55.912
- Tex, I'm in position.

41:56.715 --> 41:57.859
Are you copy?

41:57.860 --> 41:59.004
- [Tex Through Radio] Copy that.

41:59.005 --> 42:00.149
- What do you want
me to do now sir?

42:00.151 --> 42:02.886
- [Tex Through
Radio] Wait a second.

42:02.888 --> 42:05.688
- There's a lot
of Jags out there.

42:05.690 --> 42:08.024
You might wanna reconsider this.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.260
- [Tex Through Radio]
Eve and Brad, go.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.199
- Two on your left.

42:20.205 --> 42:22.705

42:22.707 --> 42:24.774
- [Gunman In Black] Oh!

42:31.016 --> 42:33.249
- How're things
going, Lieutenant?

42:33.251 --> 42:34.217
- All quiet here Sir.

42:37.889 --> 42:41.124
(suspense music)

42:41.126 --> 42:43.126
- Anyway, we need to
upgrade our security.

42:44.195 --> 42:45.328
You understand?

42:45.330 --> 42:47.597
- Of course Sir.

42:47.599 --> 42:50.033
- (gasps for air)

42:50.035 --> 42:52.268
- Bravo's going to start
the initial recon tomorrow.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.572
Depends how long it takes
for them to find something.

42:59.244 --> 43:02.245
(multiple guns fire)

43:05.784 --> 43:06.916
- What the hell was that?

43:06.918 --> 43:08.084
(alarm sounds)

43:08.086 --> 43:08.918
Shit.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.053

All back to the Pig now!

All back to the Pig now!

46:01.993 --> 46:04.460

to our Russian Satellite?

47:04.823 --> 47:05.822
- The Mill Set?

47:05.824 --> 47:08.925
Ah, no way, impossible to hack.

47:08.927 --> 47:10.860
- Do you have a better idea?

47:10.862 --> 47:13.496
At least we're trying
something different here.

47:13.498 --> 47:16.165
- I think we're
playing with fire here.

47:16.167 --> 47:18.334
They can track
you down you know?

47:18.336 --> 47:19.535
- So what?

47:21.039 --> 47:23.339
The Russians don't
give a rat's ass.

47:23.341 --> 47:25.474
They're not sharing
information with Europe.

According to the GPS

47:48.066 --> 47:49.866
this is the Polish street 46.

47:51.369 --> 47:52.935
The goddamn hotel.

48:00.011 --> 48:00.693
Eve,

48:00.694 --> 48:01.376
I want you to stay in the Pig.

48:02.347 --> 48:03.579
Me and Daniel are going in.

48:07.018 --> 48:08.251
If we're not back
within an hour,

48:09.654 --> 48:11.120
don't come looking for us.

48:13.558 --> 48:14.423
You're on your own.

My name is Robin.

49:29.100 --> 49:30.633

49:45.149 --> 49:46.349
Now you guys are contact?

49:47.318 --> 49:48.617
Robin: Yeah we are.

49:48.619 --> 49:51.187
We're gonna take
you to Transit 17.

49:51.189 --> 49:52.655
You know, we've been
in here all day,

49:52.657 --> 49:54.657
what the hell took
you guys so long?

49:54.659 --> 49:56.192
- Now hold on,

49:56.194 --> 49:57.460
we had some trouble on the way

49:57.462 --> 49:59.261
and we lost two of
our team to get here.

49:59.263 --> 50:00.997
How 'bout that?

50:00.999 --> 50:02.765
Robin: Sorry
to hear that man.

50:02.767 --> 50:05.301
(groaning)

50:10.675 --> 50:13.009
- Guys, we gotta
get out of here,

50:13.011 --> 50:14.143
it's not safe.

50:14.145 --> 50:16.145
- Yeah you bet it's not safe.

50:16.147 --> 50:17.546
C'mon let's get in the Pig.

50:19.017 --> 50:20.449
- Pig?

50:20.451 --> 50:21.684
- Yeah that's our armored truck.

50:21.686 --> 50:23.152
C'mon let's go.

50:23.154 --> 50:24.553
- Armored truck?

50:28.659 --> 50:29.358
- So

50:30.628 --> 50:31.627
nothing yet?

50:33.531 --> 50:35.364
- I'm trying to hack
into a Russian Satellite.

50:36.768 --> 50:37.600
- For what?

50:37.602 --> 50:39.035
(laughs)

50:39.037 --> 50:41.670
- Tex is wearing a track
and trace device on him

50:41.672 --> 50:43.539
and we won't be
able to communicate

50:43.541 --> 50:45.408
but at least we can
find out where they are.

50:47.545 --> 50:50.479
- Why didn't I think of that?

50:50.481 --> 50:52.448
Good job, let me
know if it works.

50:53.718 --> 50:55.518
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

50:55.520 --> 50:58.287
(suspense music)

51:08.800 --> 51:10.199
- You must be Darcy.

51:10.201 --> 51:11.200
Darcy: You're right, it's me.

51:11.202 --> 51:12.435
Glad you could make it.

51:13.704 --> 51:14.670
Tex: She the girl?

51:14.672 --> 51:16.405
- Yep that's our little Jen.

51:17.208 --> 51:18.707
- Show it to us.

51:18.709 --> 51:19.909
- What?

51:19.910 --> 51:21.110
- What, we want
to see the wound.

51:21.112 --> 51:22.278
Show us the wound.

51:25.583 --> 51:26.749
Shit, get back.

51:26.751 --> 51:28.284
Darcy: C'mon guys.

51:28.286 --> 51:30.086
It's okay, it's not contagious.

51:30.088 --> 51:32.154
Tex: Are you 100%
sure a Runner did this?

51:33.458 --> 51:34.757
- What do you think,
a dog did this?

51:34.759 --> 51:37.093
Tex: Whoa whoa whoa,
don't get too cocky on me.

51:37.095 --> 51:40.296
- Hey, calm down, she's
speaking the truth okay?

51:40.298 --> 51:41.531
Daniel: How do you know that?

51:41.532 --> 51:42.765
- Because I was there
when it happened.

51:42.767 --> 51:43.816
Look!

51:43.817 --> 51:44.866
That was a month ago,

51:44.869 --> 51:46.469
it's fucking real isn't it?

51:47.872 --> 51:51.407
(indistinct chatter)

51:51.409 --> 51:52.541
- Get her packed,

51:52.543 --> 51:53.409
we're moving on.

51:56.414 --> 51:57.480
We're running out of time.

52:00.651 --> 52:04.153
Does any of you know how she
got in contact with her father?

52:04.155 --> 52:05.788
- Yeah we did, it was us.

52:05.790 --> 52:06.655
- How was that?

52:08.292 --> 52:10.126
- Well let me tell
you the story.

52:10.128 --> 52:11.594
Couple years back

52:11.596 --> 52:13.629
she was just wondering around
out there on the streets.

52:15.299 --> 52:17.333
Darcy found her, brought
her back to the base.

52:17.335 --> 52:19.401
- Now hold on, we don't
wanna know the whole story

52:19.403 --> 52:21.604
we just wanna know
about the wound.

52:21.606 --> 52:23.506
- Well, about a month ago

52:23.508 --> 52:25.274
Darcy and her went out
looking for supplies

52:25.276 --> 52:27.343
not too far from the base.

52:27.345 --> 52:29.845
On the way back, they got
attacked by a couple of Runners.

52:31.182 --> 52:32.214
They managed to get away

52:33.518 --> 52:36.152
but Jen got this really
nasty bite on her arm.

52:36.154 --> 52:37.920
She kept it a secret.

52:37.922 --> 52:39.822
She was afraid.

52:39.824 --> 52:42.158
She knew that if we found out

52:44.328 --> 52:45.478
we would've killed her.

52:45.479 --> 52:46.629
That's why she kept it hidden.

52:46.631 --> 52:48.664
But by some miracle,
she wasn't turned.

52:50.201 --> 52:51.500
About a week later,

52:51.502 --> 52:52.701
Darcy spotted the wound.

52:55.173 --> 52:56.372
We couldn't believe it.

52:57.675 --> 52:59.508
It's a wonder we didn't
all get infected.

53:00.845 --> 53:02.211
- Yeah.

53:02.213 --> 53:04.680
How did you make
contact with her father.

53:05.816 --> 53:07.216
- We knew there must've
been something special

53:07.218 --> 53:08.284
about her blood.

53:09.420 --> 53:10.519
We wanted to find
out more information

53:10.521 --> 53:12.388
about her background.

53:12.390 --> 53:14.523
We searched out database.

53:14.525 --> 53:16.392
Her father's name popped up.

53:16.394 --> 53:18.827
A rich businessman in the UK.

53:18.829 --> 53:20.629
That's how we made contact.

53:20.631 --> 53:22.565
That's how we got this
whole thing set up.

53:24.869 --> 53:26.502
- So you think he
can be trusted?

53:26.504 --> 53:27.403
- I think so.

53:28.839 --> 53:31.941
What would you do if that was
your little girl out there

53:31.943 --> 53:33.342
and you found out
she was still alive

53:33.344 --> 53:34.543
after all this time?

53:35.780 --> 53:36.979
Don't you think you would
do everything possible

53:36.981 --> 53:38.847
to get her back?

53:38.849 --> 53:40.349
- Yeah, but that's
not the point.

53:40.351 --> 53:41.550
The point is, will
he keep his word

53:41.552 --> 53:42.585
about the vaccine?

53:44.422 --> 53:45.721
- If they knew an infected girl

53:45.723 --> 53:47.256
had entered the UK

53:47.258 --> 53:48.724
she would be killed on the spot.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.360
Her father's not stupid,

53:51.362 --> 53:53.395
he knows the risk.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.598
Besides, Jen would
never let us down.

53:56.801 --> 53:58.234
Darcy's been like
a mother to her.

53:59.003 --> 54:00.002
- Hmm.

54:00.004 --> 54:01.704
All right, get a radio,

54:01.706 --> 54:03.339
we need to make
contact with our base.

54:03.341 --> 54:04.707
Robin: Yeah, follow me.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.350
- [Tex Through Radio] Eve,
we're almost done here.

54:14.352 --> 54:15.618
Stay in the Pig alright?

54:20.524 --> 54:23.259
- JP, take five, I got it.

54:23.261 --> 54:23.959
- Okay.

54:30.801 --> 54:33.869
- Say um, what happened
to all the men out here?

54:33.871 --> 54:34.637
I see only women.

54:35.740 --> 54:36.739
- Look

54:36.741 --> 54:38.440
a couple of months back,

54:38.442 --> 54:40.042
we picked up this signal
from a group of survivors

54:40.044 --> 54:41.610
calling out for help.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.279
Our Alpha team went
to check it out.

54:44.415 --> 54:46.282
We though we could help.

54:46.284 --> 54:48.751
Man, we were dead wrong.

54:48.753 --> 54:51.787
Our entire team got
turned into those things.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.889
That's why we called you
guys in to do the job.

54:56.627 --> 54:57.960
- All right um,

54:57.962 --> 54:59.628
I don't want to think
about these things but

54:59.630 --> 55:00.663
can you log in from now?

55:10.975 --> 55:12.341
- Just hang on,

55:12.343 --> 55:13.776
I'm gonna log you in real quick.

55:15.346 --> 55:17.713
(alarm beeps)

55:18.716 --> 55:20.449
- Sir,

55:20.451 --> 55:21.383
there's a signal coming in.

55:25.456 --> 55:26.755
- Colonel,

55:26.757 --> 55:28.791
I got someone here you
might wanna talk to.

55:32.797 --> 55:33.796
- Robert.

55:33.798 --> 55:35.831
- (laughs) Tex.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.966
Oh God damn I'm
glad to see you man.

55:37.968 --> 55:39.435
So, what happened out there?

55:39.437 --> 55:40.669
Where are you guys now?

55:41.639 --> 55:43.005
- Well we had to flee,

55:43.007 --> 55:44.039
leave Brad behind.

55:45.443 --> 55:46.642
- Oh god.

55:46.644 --> 55:47.609
What happened?

55:47.611 --> 55:48.577
He get shot?

55:50.014 --> 55:51.347
- We don't know that yet,

55:51.349 --> 55:52.881
he might be still alive.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.551
- God dammit!

55:55.553 --> 55:56.819
I shouldn't let you guys go out.

55:59.423 --> 56:00.055
It's my fault.

56:00.057 --> 56:01.457
- Look Robert,

56:01.459 --> 56:02.124
what happened, happened,

56:02.126 --> 56:03.359
it's not your fault.

56:03.361 --> 56:04.393
We had a choice.

56:05.396 --> 56:07.129
- What about Daniel and Eve?

56:07.131 --> 56:09.031
- Yeah, they're fine.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.666
- Tex I'm not gonna
blame you if you

56:10.668 --> 56:12.868
bring the team back
into home base.

56:12.870 --> 56:14.036
- Negative.

56:14.038 --> 56:16.372
We didn't come this
far to quit now.

56:16.374 --> 56:18.374
We have to finish this.

56:18.376 --> 56:19.675
- You sure?

56:19.677 --> 56:20.943
- Yeah,

56:20.945 --> 56:22.578
I do.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.546
Look, we're wasting
valuable time here,

56:24.548 --> 56:25.447
we need to go.

56:27.017 --> 56:28.083
- Tex Tex, hold on.

56:29.754 --> 56:32.421
There's a track and trace
device in your belt.

56:32.423 --> 56:34.523
Do not take it off okay?

56:34.525 --> 56:35.758
We won't be able to communicate

56:35.760 --> 56:37.559
but at least we will
know where you are.

56:38.496 --> 56:40.095
Okay.

56:40.097 --> 56:42.531
- Tex give my regards to
Daniel and Eve all right and

56:42.533 --> 56:44.032
good luck to you guys.

56:44.034 --> 56:46.034
- I'll contact you as soon
as we deliver the girl.

56:46.036 --> 56:46.935
Alright.

56:48.072 --> 56:48.771
- Tex.

56:50.908 --> 56:51.807
- What?

56:52.710 --> 56:53.776
- Sorry about Brad.

56:54.879 --> 56:55.978
- Yeah

56:55.980 --> 56:57.012
look

56:57.014 --> 56:58.480
if Brad is still alive,

56:58.482 --> 56:59.882
we'll find him

56:59.884 --> 57:00.983
alright?

57:00.985 --> 57:02.117
Bye.

57:02.119 --> 57:05.020
(computer clicks)

57:12.997 --> 57:13.896
Alright,

57:15.099 --> 57:15.931
is she ready?

57:20.771 --> 57:21.687
- Yeah we're done here.

57:21.688 --> 57:22.604
- Tex, can I have
a word with you?

57:23.574 --> 57:24.907
- What's up?

57:24.909 --> 57:25.941
- It's kind of private.

57:32.716 --> 57:33.949
- Alright, let's go or no?

57:35.886 --> 57:38.153
- I don't know, it's
these people here.

57:38.155 --> 57:38.954
- What about them?

57:40.724 --> 57:42.491
- They live in terrible
conditions man.

57:44.228 --> 57:45.127
They need help.

57:46.864 --> 57:48.464
- What's your point?

57:48.466 --> 57:49.598
- Well if you don't mind,

57:49.600 --> 57:50.966
I would like to stay.

57:50.968 --> 57:52.634
- Hell yeah too right.

57:52.636 --> 57:54.002
This mission ain't over yet.

57:56.607 --> 57:58.140
- Look

57:58.142 --> 57:59.174
we passed the outpost,

58:00.611 --> 58:01.977
we're close to the checkpoint.

58:04.215 --> 58:05.481
What can possibly go wrong now?

58:05.483 --> 58:06.682
- Well it didn't go wrong.

58:07.985 --> 58:09.618
Everything so far
has been going wrong,

58:09.620 --> 58:10.786
do I have to remind you?

58:10.788 --> 58:12.654
- Look around you

58:12.656 --> 58:14.857
this transit is
about to break down.

58:20.264 --> 58:21.763
- Alright,

58:21.765 --> 58:22.698
we'll manage.

58:25.269 --> 58:27.536
Just make sure you're
here when we come back

58:27.538 --> 58:28.837
and stay in touch with Robert.

58:28.839 --> 58:29.671
- Sure.

58:29.673 --> 58:30.572
- Okay?

58:34.011 --> 58:34.910
Come on, let's go.

58:41.185 --> 58:42.217
- Give me your last hug.

58:46.257 --> 58:47.523
- Hey.

58:47.525 --> 58:48.857
Okay so don't be sad, okay?

58:48.859 --> 58:50.526
You're gonna see
your dad again and

58:50.528 --> 58:51.693
your supposed to be happy.

58:53.163 --> 58:54.763
- She's right, make
us proud baby girl.

58:54.765 --> 58:56.298
- I will.

58:56.299 --> 58:57.832
- Give us a sign as soon
as you're safe, okay?

58:57.835 --> 58:58.634
- I will.

59:00.771 --> 59:01.703
Bye.

59:06.544 --> 59:07.576
- [Tex] Eve,

59:07.578 --> 59:08.076
we're coming in.

59:14.852 --> 59:16.084
- This is sick.

59:17.555 --> 59:19.788
(typing)

59:22.026 --> 59:24.159
- So you're sixteen, right?

59:24.161 --> 59:25.561
Jen: Yep, next month.

59:28.299 --> 59:30.198
- So you must have been about
nine when the virus broke?

59:30.200 --> 59:31.166
(beeping)

59:31.168 --> 59:32.067
- Yep.

59:34.905 --> 59:38.040
- So how come you're in
Belgium and dad's in the UK?

59:38.042 --> 59:39.775
Jen: My mum, she's Belgian,

59:39.777 --> 59:41.910
and when my parents divorced,

59:41.912 --> 59:43.245
my father moved back to England.

59:43.247 --> 59:44.713
- You miss him?

59:44.715 --> 59:46.114
Jen: Yeah, I do, a lot.

59:47.618 --> 59:48.283
- What about your mom?

59:54.692 --> 59:55.290
- I miss her.

01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:01.680
So much.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:02.730
We were a family at Wervik.

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:04.666
When our house was
attacked by runners, I,

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:09.004
I was so scared.

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:09.905
I ran away.

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:12.808
And that's the last
time I saw her.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:16.144
- It must have been
horrible for you.

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:19.247
Hey, is it true?

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:20.749
About the bite.

01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:23.051
- Oh yeah, it's real.

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:24.987
I couldn't believe
it myself at first.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:27.255
- You know, if they
find a vaccine,

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:29.758
you're gonna be a
legend, you know that?

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.259
- I don't wanna be a legend,

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:33.996
but I would do anything to
save us from this shithole.

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:38.100
- Yeah well, let's hope
daddy feels the same way.

01:00:38.102 --> 01:00:40.736
- He does, he would do
anything to have it done.

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:41.403
I know him.

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:44.406
- I believe you.

01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:48.810
(gentle music)

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.680
(engine humming)

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:04.860
(computer beeping)

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:12.300
(engine spluttering)

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.004
- Oh, no.

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:18.840
Dammit!

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:22.844
- [Eve] Tex?

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:23.879
- You blew up the engine.

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:30.385
We gonna have to walk.

01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:40.796
(car engine roaring)

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:42.698
- C'mon, move, move!

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:46.268
(footsteps pounding)
(dramatic music)

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.169
- When did it happen?

01:01:47.171 --> 01:01:48.036
- Don't know.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:50.872
- And who was there?

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:52.841
- I don't know,
I didn't see her.

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:53.742
Fuck.

01:02:01.018 --> 01:02:03.985
Fuck, snipers, we're
surrounded, get out!

01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:05.220
Get out!

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:06.188
- Get out of here!

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:07.389
- This way, this way, this way!

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:09.024
[Woman With Black
Hair] Go, move, move!

01:02:09.026 --> 01:02:11.760
(dramatic music)

01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:14.830
(metal door grinds)

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:15.497
(canister clanks)

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:17.332
- Move!

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:19.735
(gunshots firing)

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:20.869
(woman screams)

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:23.772
(gunshots firing)

01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:29.044
(man screams)

01:02:29.046 --> 01:02:34.116
(gunshot firing)
(woman screams)

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:39.955
(machine gun firing)
(screaming)

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:41.256
- If you wanna make
(sound drowns out speaker)

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.291
then you don't know who
you're messing with.

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:45.961
- I told you you're
never gonna hack in.

01:02:45.963 --> 01:02:48.196
- Shut up, Snow, okay I'm
the master of the universe

01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:49.297
behind the keyboard, okay?

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:53.435
Tex: How many clicks are
we away from the target?

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:57.239
(computer bleeping)

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:59.074
- 85 clicks away.

01:02:59.076 --> 01:03:00.375
Tex: How much
time do we got left?

01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:01.243
(computer bleeping)
(typing)

01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:04.246
Eve: A half...

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:06.181
- I'm out of ammo
for the M20 as well.

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:07.415
- Hey, can I have a gun too?

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:08.250
- No you cannot.

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:10.886
Just make sure you
stay close to us.

01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:11.820
(radio static)

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:12.788
- The radio's dead.

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:14.256
So we're on our own.

01:03:14.258 --> 01:03:15.824
The next village
is two clicks away.

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:17.192
- Come on, we're rolling out.

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:24.266
- [Man with tattoos]
Commander, sir.

01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:26.401
The general wants to see you.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:27.803
- I'll be right up.

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:29.204
- [Man With Tattoos]
Yes sir, commander, sir!

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:34.309
- Come on, come on, come on,

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:37.813
come on, come on,
come on, come on,

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:38.847
yeah, come on.

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:40.582
- [Computer] Goes to position.

01:03:40.584 --> 01:03:42.284
- Shit, I'm in!

01:03:42.286 --> 01:03:44.386
I'm in, oh damn, I'm good.

01:03:44.388 --> 01:03:45.554
Snow: What?

01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:47.956
Renee: Ooh! (laughs)

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:48.857
- No way.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:50.592
- I'm in.

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:51.493
- How did you...?

01:03:54.932 --> 01:03:58.099
- Yeah. (loud exhale)

01:03:58.101 --> 01:03:59.467
- I'm in.

01:03:59.469 --> 01:04:01.469
(typing)

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:07.142
(laughs)

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:09.578
- Commander Briggs.

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.279
I got a briefing.

01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:14.316
The outpost at the West
Border has been attacked.

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:15.617
It seems like you're
losing your grip

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:17.619
on the Resistance again.

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:20.288
- We were not expecting such a
massive attack, General, sir.

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:22.490
Our soldiers are well trained.

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:25.160
We'll trace their nest and
exterminate it at once.

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:26.862
Only a few managed to escape.

01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:30.465
- I don't care
how many are left.

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:33.235
I want you to hunt them
down and destroy them all.

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:37.038
If you not capable
of doing the job,

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.008
then perhaps we should place
somebody else in charge.

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.543
Do I make myself clear?

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.347
- Yes sir, General, sir.

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:50.552
- Last chance,
Commander, fix it!

01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:52.921
Dismissed!

01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:58.927
(drums pounding)

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:02.297
(somber music)

01:05:02.299 --> 01:05:03.531
(footsteps crunching)

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:04.232
- You okay?

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:07.068
Jen: Yeah.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.104
I'm feeling hungry though.

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.207
- Here you go.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:15.210
It's my secret stash.

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:16.211
So don't tell Tex.

01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:21.650
It's good?

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:22.450
- It's pretty good.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:23.318
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.219
Let's catch up.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:35.263
What is it?

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.467
(eerie music)

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:43.571
- All around us.

01:05:43.573 --> 01:05:44.673
No gangs.

01:05:44.675 --> 01:05:46.508
(birds chirping)

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.244
Very quiet, that's
kind of odd, isn't it?

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:52.280
- I heard they were gonna
leave the West Side.

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:55.283
- Yeah, but nothing at all.

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:58.219
Isn't that kind of odd?

01:05:58.221 --> 01:06:01.323
- Maybe they'll just
exterminate later.

01:06:03.727 --> 01:06:05.026
- You know,

01:06:05.028 --> 01:06:07.128
you know what,

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.130
I'm gonna take a
closer look over there.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:10.532
Got my back?

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:12.334
- Sure.

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:13.635
- Don't waste any bullets
unless you have to.

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:15.136
We got only a few left.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:20.475
- Jen,

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:22.610
get down in the hole.

01:06:26.216 --> 01:06:29.017
(drums pounding)

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:33.355
(suspenseful music)

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:49.537
(door thuds)

01:07:00.784 --> 01:07:02.784
- You can come down now,

01:07:02.786 --> 01:07:03.485
all clear.

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:11.359
- Copy, Jen, let's move.

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:14.462
This way.

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:21.603
(metal door grating)

01:07:36.787 --> 01:07:37.485
- All right.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:39.654
It seems clear.

01:07:41.058 --> 01:07:42.657
Let's see what we can do here.

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:44.459
(gun clicks)

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:45.794
- I wouldn't do that,

01:07:45.796 --> 01:07:46.728
if I were you.

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:51.166
Now drop the guns.

01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:54.235
And put your hands up.

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:57.205
- Okay, calm down.

01:07:57.207 --> 01:07:58.673
Gonna put the gun down, okay?

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:01.443
Don't pull the trigger.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.546
(gun clanking)

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:05.547
- Hey you,

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:07.682
drop the guns!

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:11.820
- Eve, be smart.

01:08:11.822 --> 01:08:12.687
Put the gun down.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:17.725
Do it.

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:20.562
(metal clinking)

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:23.564
Hey look, guys, we
have no beef with you,

01:08:23.567 --> 01:08:24.532
we're just passing--

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.568
- [Man With Gun] Shut up!

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:32.474
- Eve?

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:35.676
Is that you?

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:36.578
- Joe?

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.745
- My God.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:40.215
(laughing)

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:41.800
Eve: It's good to see you.

01:08:41.801 --> 01:08:43.384
- It's all right, guys,
you can lower the guns now.

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:44.319
I know this chick.

01:08:46.857 --> 01:08:49.124
Eve: It's been
a long time, right?

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:49.624
- Yeah, well,

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.460
things are moving on.

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:57.432
Eve: Oh, this is Jen.

01:08:57.434 --> 01:08:58.433
- Hi, Jen.

01:08:58.435 --> 01:09:00.435
- This is Tex, our team leader.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:02.604
- Team leader, hm?

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:03.438
- Nice to meet you.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.240
- Nice to meet you, Tex.

01:09:05.242 --> 01:09:06.274
Sorry about the ambush.

01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:09.144
- No problem, I understand.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:11.613
- You know what,
let's go to our camp.

01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:13.581
We going to be a
lot safer there.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.550
Okay guys, let's go,
keep the guns loaded.

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:16.350
That way.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:32.367
(fist thumps)
(prisoner cries out)

01:09:32.903 --> 01:09:35.403
(Daniel moans)

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.304
- So,

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:38.805
I figure you're not
going to tell us

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:40.375
where your friends are hiding.

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.510
Right?

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.511
- Why don't you
go fuck yourself?

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.781
(Daniel panting)

01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:47.582
- Mass,

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:51.419
how many teeth does a man have?

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.860
- I don't know, Commander, sir.

01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:03.431
(knuckles crunching)

01:10:03.433 --> 01:10:06.501
- Why don't you
count them for me.

01:10:06.503 --> 01:10:09.671
(fist thumps)
- Ooh, ah.

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:13.675
(dramatic music)

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.882
(steel doors grinding)

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:23.685
(birds screeching)

01:10:35.298 --> 01:10:36.698
- You know what,

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.000
you got yourself
a nice place here.

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:40.668
- Yeah, we found it
just a few months ago.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.004
And we built ourselves
a safe place.

01:10:43.006 --> 01:10:45.306
It's pretty rough these
days with those gangs.

01:10:45.308 --> 01:10:46.674
- Yeah, you're right about that.

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:49.377
Definitely.

01:10:49.379 --> 01:10:52.480
- Joe, there's a
problem with the fences.

01:10:52.482 --> 01:10:54.716
- Get it fixed before
the night falls, okay?

01:10:54.718 --> 01:10:55.650
- Runners?

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:56.985
- No, wild animals.

01:10:56.987 --> 01:10:59.554
At night they come
and search for food.

01:10:59.556 --> 01:11:02.257
We're doing quite
well here, lately.

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:05.827
We start to grow some
vegetables, breed a few animals.

01:11:05.829 --> 01:11:07.528
It's nice to have some
fresh food on the table

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:08.963
from time to time.

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:10.865
- Yeah.

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:13.868
- This is Mandy, Mandy,
this is Eve, my sister in...

01:11:18.008 --> 01:11:19.040
- Nice to meet you.

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:25.980
- Hi Mandy, my name is Tex.

01:11:25.982 --> 01:11:27.482
This is little Jen.

01:11:27.484 --> 01:11:28.383
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:31.486
- [Young Girl] Hi.

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:33.855
- Why don't you go play?

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:35.340
- Yeah!

01:11:35.341 --> 01:11:36.824
- I've got a game, do
you wanna come see it?

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:37.558
Jen: Yeah, sure.

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:40.595
- Why don't you have a seat?

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:45.767
- Can I offer you
something to drink?

01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:47.068
Water, tea?

01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:50.705
- You don't happen to
have something stronger.

01:11:50.707 --> 01:11:51.673
- No, Tex.

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:55.076
- (grunts) Water's fine.

01:11:59.549 --> 01:12:00.882
- You don't owe
me an explanation.

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:05.320
Life happens, things move on.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.990
- As long as you know how
much I loved your, sister.

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:13.594
- Oh yeah, thank you.

01:12:13.596 --> 01:12:14.495
- Yeah.

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:19.901
- So you're just
passing through, right?

01:12:19.903 --> 01:12:20.768
- Yeah.

01:12:22.072 --> 01:12:23.971
- We need to get to
the harbor of France.

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:26.407
- Yeah, we're in desperate
need of a solid vehicle.

01:12:26.409 --> 01:12:28.076
Can you help us out?

01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:30.578
- Why would you want
to go to France?

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.380
- We need to get
Jen to the harbor.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:34.682
We're part of the Resistance.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:39.637
It's getting hot in the East.

01:12:39.638 --> 01:12:40.587
The marshals are already
cleansing the City of Rouge.

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:40.888
We need to go.

01:12:45.095 --> 01:12:45.793
- The Resistance?

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:49.397
I heard great stories
about you guys.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.468
But honest, don't think the
marshals are interested in us.

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:54.502
We're just survivors.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:57.972
- Make no mistake,

01:12:57.974 --> 01:12:58.806
they will come over.

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:00.007
Just a matter of time.

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:01.743
So you better get
your people prepared.

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:05.079
- Look Joe, we're
running out of time.

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:06.147
Can you help us?

01:13:11.121 --> 01:13:12.687
- The car won't be the problem.

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:13.588
Gas.

01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:16.691
Gas is getting
precious these days.

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.830
Look guys, I really would
like to help you out,

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:24.532
but we only have 50 liters left.

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:27.468
And we need that.

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:28.903
For our generators.

01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:34.041
- How about a truck,
with 500 liters,

01:13:34.043 --> 01:13:36.177
in exchange for a
car with a full tank?

01:13:36.179 --> 01:13:37.078
- That's right.

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:41.816
(car engine)

01:13:41.818 --> 01:13:44.018
(car brake)

01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:55.430
- A solid car with a 370
horsepower with a turbo engine.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:58.132
It will bring you to
250 kilometers an hour.

01:13:58.134 --> 01:14:01.436
It's a tank, it can basically
handle any situation,

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:02.170
especially with the gear we're

01:14:02.172 --> 01:14:03.771
putting in the trunk right now.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:07.575
- Done good, thanks
for everything, Joe.

01:14:07.577 --> 01:14:08.876
- Anytime.
- Take care.

01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:09.777
- Likewise.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.980
(car door)

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:14.148
(soft harp music)

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:14.849
- Thanks, Joe.

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:23.024
- Take care of yourself.

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:25.760
I hope to see you one day.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:30.798
- She's a good
woman. You take care.

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:34.235
(car door sound)

01:14:34.237 --> 01:14:36.671
(car engine)

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:40.641
(car engine rev)

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:45.112
(car engine rumble)

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:57.592
(car tires screech)

01:15:02.632 --> 01:15:04.632
- Sir, they're moving again.

01:15:04.634 --> 01:15:05.833
This time it's a lot faster.

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.904
- How close are
we to the target?

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:12.507
- About 30 kilometers by now.

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:14.809
- Ah, finally some good news.

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:16.644
Well, hopefully
they'll be on time.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.987
- Think we have just enough
gas to reach the coast.

01:15:30.627 --> 01:15:32.093
Know what?

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:33.694
Didn't knew you had
brother-inlaw?

01:15:35.298 --> 01:15:38.533
Hell, I even didn't
knew you had a sister.

01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:43.905
(radio static)

01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:50.978
(car driving)

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.548
(tense music)

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:05.192
(car tire rolling
on gravel road)

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:12.833
- Crap. What the fuck now.

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:16.871
Eve: What do you want to do?

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:19.707
Jen: Are we gonna help him?

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:20.942
- I don't trust this.

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:24.345
(gun cocks)

01:16:24.347 --> 01:16:25.179
Lay yourself down.

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:29.717
- Let's get closer.

01:16:29.719 --> 01:16:30.952
- Are you sure?

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:33.254
All right.

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:39.193
(car driving)

01:16:39.195 --> 01:16:41.195
(car acceleration)

01:16:41.197 --> 01:16:43.764
(gun shots)

01:16:46.836 --> 01:16:48.169
(car engine)

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:50.371
(car crash)

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:55.109
(car engine)

01:17:01.351 --> 01:17:04.085
(intense music)

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:13.628
(puddle splash)

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:16.897
(man screaming)

01:17:16.899 --> 01:17:19.934
(car engine roars)

01:17:19.936 --> 01:17:23.004
(car tires screech)

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:27.008
(car engine)

01:17:31.114 --> 01:17:33.848
(man screaming)

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:38.285
(gun shots)

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:42.390
(car tires screech)

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:49.964
(man cheering)

01:17:54.404 --> 01:17:55.403
- Grenade!

01:17:55.405 --> 01:17:57.371
(car tires screech)

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.939
(explosion)

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:00.107
- Commander, sir.

01:18:02.945 --> 01:18:05.746
we spotted an explosion close
to the border of France.

01:18:05.748 --> 01:18:07.281
- Get me chopper.

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:07.748
- Sir, yes sir.

01:18:11.988 --> 01:18:13.821
(suspenseful music)

01:18:13.823 --> 01:18:15.723
Snow: Sir, they're back.

01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:16.924
- How far now?

01:18:16.926 --> 01:18:18.793
- About five ticks
away to targets.

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:19.960
- Are they gonna make it?

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:21.762
- Yeah, seems like it.
- Good.

01:18:21.764 --> 01:18:23.297
(helicopter rumble)

01:18:23.299 --> 01:18:25.966
(car engine)

01:18:25.968 --> 01:18:28.335
(machine gun)

01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:33.708
(bullet sounds)

01:18:35.478 --> 01:18:37.344
(car tires screech)

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:40.214
(aircraft sound)

01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:43.217
- Eve!
(car trunk)

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:47.188
What are you doing? What
the fuck are you doing?

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:48.389
Get back in the car!

01:18:50.293 --> 01:18:51.325
(man screaming)

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:53.327
Get back here!
(gun fires)

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:55.930
(explosion)

01:18:57.967 --> 01:18:59.133
(helicopter crash)

01:18:59.135 --> 01:19:02.503
Now that's how you
take out a chopper, ha!

01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:03.971
Take this, assholes!

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:06.741
(fire crackling)

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:09.477
You know, Eve, you're
the most craziest bitch

01:19:09.479 --> 01:19:10.377
I've ever met.

01:19:12.315 --> 01:19:13.981
But you can ride
with me anytime.

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:15.516
Ha! See you in hell.

01:19:16.519 --> 01:19:18.252
- We've got 15 minutes.

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:23.124
(heroic music)

01:19:27.497 --> 01:19:30.064
(radio sound)

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:36.437
(birds gawking)

01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:40.374
- Sir, the men are
getting nervous.

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:42.376
I think we should leave.

01:19:42.378 --> 01:19:44.512
- This is my daughter we're
talking about. We stay.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.462
(suspenseful cinematic music)

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:07.401
(car engine sound)

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:10.137
(car screeches)

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:17.144
(cheering)

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:32.159
- Dad!

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:35.830
- Jen!

01:20:40.303 --> 01:20:42.002
Look at you.

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:45.840
Oh, you're so beautiful.
You're just like your mom.

01:20:45.842 --> 01:20:48.309
(heroic music)

01:20:52.982 --> 01:20:53.998
- Sir-

01:20:53.999 --> 01:20:55.015
- Can I have a minute here?

01:21:01.624 --> 01:21:03.123
Thank you so much for
bringing back my daughter.

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:03.991
- You're welcome.

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:04.858
- You saved my life.

01:21:07.964 --> 01:21:09.430
- You're daughter is
very special, sir.

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:16.437
You know, a lotta
people depend on you.

01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:19.006
She's the only one who can
get us outta this hell.

01:21:19.942 --> 01:21:20.975
Don't let us down.

01:21:22.478 --> 01:21:24.345
- I promise you,

01:21:24.347 --> 01:21:27.314
I will spend every dime
I have to find a vaccine.

01:21:27.316 --> 01:21:29.283
You have my word of honor.

01:21:29.285 --> 01:21:30.317
- I'll hold you to that.

01:21:32.955 --> 01:21:35.189
- [Soldier] Sir, we have to go.

01:21:35.191 --> 01:21:36.156
Now!

01:21:36.158 --> 01:21:37.892
- He's right, you should go now.

01:21:38.294 --> 01:21:39.193
Goodbye, Jen.

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:49.136
(soft piano music)

01:21:49.138 --> 01:21:51.505
- You take care. Okay?

01:21:51.507 --> 01:21:53.540
- All right, let's move.

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:06.220
- Do you think he's
gonna keep his word?

01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:10.224
- That's for us to find
out later on, isn't it?

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.661
You know, I could
sure use a drink now.

01:22:13.663 --> 01:22:15.079
- Forget it.

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.496
- Maybe find a liquor
store on the way back.

01:22:16.499 --> 01:22:17.431
- We need gas.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.269
- You're a very menacing
chick, you know that?

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:23.671
Don't you have any
mercy with an old vet?

01:22:23.673 --> 01:22:26.573
- Old vet? You're a drunk.

01:22:26.575 --> 01:22:29.543
- Yeah, and who are you? Mother
Teresa with a sniper gun?

01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:30.244
(scoffs)

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:41.288
(car engine and tire screeching)

01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:53.500
(heroic music)
