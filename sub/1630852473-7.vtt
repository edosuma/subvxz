00:02.585 --> 00:04.295
ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Remain seated, please.</i>

00:04.379 --> 00:06.464
(in Spanish)
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

00:06.548 --> 00:08.550
(lively music)

00:11.386 --> 00:12.637
(elephants trumpeting)

00:18.977 --> 00:20.103
MAN 1: <i>The love of liberty.</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:21.688
(moans)

00:21.771 --> 00:22.856
(screaming)

00:29.612 --> 00:30.947
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:31.031 --> 00:34.409
<i>Disneyland has now ended
its normal operating day.</i>

00:34.492 --> 00:39.247
NARRATOR: <i>Ah... there's nothing
more satisfying and exhausting</i>

00:39.330 --> 00:41.541
<i>than a long day at Disneyland.</i>

00:41.624 --> 00:45.962
<i>But for some lucky guests,
their magical day is just getting started,</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:48.381
<i>because they'll be resting
their weary feet</i>

00:48.465 --> 00:52.886
<i>and child-crushed shoulders
at the historic Disneyland Hotel.</i>

00:52.969 --> 00:57.515
<i>Not only was it the place to stay
back when it opened in the mid '50s,</i>

00:57.599 --> 01:02.103
<i>it really was a place where kids
and grownups alike were immersed</i>

01:02.187 --> 01:06.232
<i>in a fantastical experience
that maybe even rivaled</i>

01:06.316 --> 01:08.485
<i>the theme park across the parking lot.</i>

01:08.568 --> 01:10.779
We were a destination in itself.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.822
MAN 2:
<i>Where children are especially welcome.</i>

01:12.906 --> 01:16.034
My early memories of going to Disneyland,
not Disneyland the park,

01:16.159 --> 01:18.328
but, actually,
it was the Disneyland Hotel.

01:18.787 --> 01:22.332
My nephew actually thought
that the Disneyland Hotel was Disneyland.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.000
MAN 2: <i>Mothers getting the kiddies to bed.</i>

01:24.084 --> 01:25.585
I mean, it has a huge history.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.755
NARRATOR: <i>A huge and surprising history
that paved the way</i>

01:28.838 --> 01:32.008
<i>for a completely new kind of experience...</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:33.927
I would call it a flagship hotel.

01:34.010 --> 01:39.766
<i>...that continues to drive innovation
and immersion to hotels you won't believe.</i>

01:39.849 --> 01:41.643
NARRATOR: <i>But before we lay our towel</i>

01:41.726 --> 01:44.813
<i>on the white, sandy beaches
of modern Disney hotels,</i>

01:44.896 --> 01:47.816
<i>let's start this story in... Anaheim.</i>

01:47.899 --> 01:49.234
Anaheim? Where's Anaheim?

01:49.317 --> 01:50.318
NARRATOR: <i>Good question.</i>

01:50.401 --> 01:53.196
<i>Well, according to this pencil, it's here.</i>

01:53.780 --> 01:55.490
<i>But back in the early '50s...</i>

01:55.573 --> 01:58.785
Everywhere was oranges.
Truly, it was an orange grove!

01:58.868 --> 02:01.996
NARRATOR: <i>No beaches,
landmarks, mountains, or lakes. </i>

02:02.080 --> 02:04.332
Just miles and miles of...

02:04.415 --> 02:06.751
Oranges. There are no hotels nearby.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.878
NARRATOR:
<i>There really wasn't much of anything.</i>

02:08.962 --> 02:12.090
Even the Santa Ana Freeway
was just finishing up.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.551
NARRATOR: <i>Well, at that point,
the road to building Disneyland</i>

02:14.634 --> 02:18.012
<i>was a long, potholed, bumpy,
unfinished one.</i>

02:18.096 --> 02:22.308
At that point, nobody really knew
what Disneyland was going to be like,

02:22.392 --> 02:23.852
if it was gonna be a success or not.

02:23.935 --> 02:27.105
He didn't have the funds
to build the hotel himself,

02:27.188 --> 02:29.607
<i>so he was looking for investors in order
to be able to do it.</i>

02:29.691 --> 02:32.318
DAVID: <i>Walt went to many hotel
companies around the United States.</i>

02:32.402 --> 02:34.112
He didn't want just any old hotel there.

02:34.195 --> 02:37.407
He had a... a certain level of excellence
that he wanted to meet there.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.491
NARRATOR: <i>Typical Walt.</i>

02:38.575 --> 02:39.742
So, he turned to Jack Wrather.

02:39.826 --> 02:43.329
NARRATOR: <i>Of course, he did!
Uh, sorry. Who's Jack Wrather?</i>

02:43.413 --> 02:47.041
MAN 3: <i>The Wrathers consider themselves
a fairly typical family.</i>

02:47.125 --> 02:51.171
Jack Wrather lived in Holmby Hills.
He was a neighbor of Walt Disney.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.256
And they ran in the same circles.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.800
NARRATOR: <i>And although Jack's wealth
came from black gold,</i>

02:55.884 --> 02:58.428
<i>he started pouring money
into making TV gold.</i>

02:58.511 --> 03:00.847
And actually started producing
big-time TV shows.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.473
Both Lassie and The Lone Ranger.

03:02.557 --> 03:07.020
He was a successful producer,
and innovator, and, uh, investor.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.354
-NARRATOR: <i>And husband.</i>
-(laughter)

03:08.438 --> 03:11.774
MICHAEL: <i>Mrs. Wrather was a child star.</i>

03:12.150 --> 03:13.443
An actress.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.112
JUDI: <i>Fifty-five movies, she did,
by the time she was 23.</i>

03:16.196 --> 03:18.907
And I still do a little television
here and there.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.783
NARRATOR: <i>But in reality, she was also...</i>

03:20.867 --> 03:21.951
A businesswoman.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.370
BONITA: <i>I'm busy
with all of Jack's enterprises,</i>

03:24.454 --> 03:28.041
and he's the kind of wonderful husband
that includes me in everything.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.918
They were lovely people.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.295
They were magic together.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.547
NARRATOR: <i>Wait a minute! A magic family?</i>

03:34.631 --> 03:38.134
<i>Well, Walt was building a magic kingdom
for families!</i>

03:38.218 --> 03:42.555
As the story goes, Walt Disney
was at a cocktail party with Jack Wrather.

03:42.639 --> 03:46.684
Walt is grousing about,
"I can't get anybody to build a hotel."

03:46.768 --> 03:51.314
And Jack said, "Hmm. Maybe
I'm interested." And Walt said, "Wow."

03:51.397 --> 03:54.901
NARRATOR: <i>Sensing the Wrathers were
rather interested, Walt pounced.</i>

03:54.984 --> 03:56.152
"Let's go down tomorrow."

03:56.611 --> 04:01.491
The next day, Jack Wrather got in a car
and drove down to, of all places, Anaheim.

04:01.574 --> 04:05.203
WALT: <i>Turn right at the next corner,
Harbor Boulevard. And here we are.</i>

04:05.286 --> 04:09.999
And they get to where the park is.
And, I mean, it's all... it's dirt.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.085
(quirky music)

04:13.044 --> 04:14.420
NARRATOR: <i>But being an oil man,</i>

04:14.837 --> 04:18.341
<i>Jack knew that dirt
was just a grubby coating</i>

04:18.424 --> 04:20.635
<i>to the bountiful opportunities beneath.</i>

04:20.718 --> 04:22.637
<i>So, instead of heading for the hills...</i>

04:22.720 --> 04:25.556
MICHAEL: <i>They walked through the dirt
over to, uh, the construction site,</i>

04:25.932 --> 04:28.851
<i>and Walt Disney says,
"And here's the main gate.</i>

04:29.143 --> 04:30.687
<i>This is where everybody's
going to come in."</i>

04:30.770 --> 04:31.980
But nothing's up.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.023
And, um, and they walk across,

04:34.482 --> 04:36.818
uh, what will be eventually
the parking lot.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.404
<i>"And this is where the Disneyland Hotel
will be."</i>

04:39.487 --> 04:41.072
NARRATOR: <i>But not just any hotel...</i>

04:41.281 --> 04:43.783
Walt certainly didn't think
that it was just a hotel,

04:43.866 --> 04:46.411
that they want it
to be an extended experience.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.414
NARRATOR:
<i>An extended experience for families,</i>

04:49.497 --> 04:52.792
<i>which, at the time,
was a concept that didn't really exist.</i>

04:52.875 --> 04:56.462
MAN 2: <i>We all know that different hotels
have different ideas about children.</i>

04:56.546 --> 04:58.423
Hotels at that time
in the '50s and stuff were

04:58.506 --> 05:00.758
for businessmen
that were on business travel.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.011
DONALD: <i>It was unheard of to,
you know, to have families.</i>

05:03.094 --> 05:04.470
NARRATOR: <i>Which was simply because...</i>

05:04.554 --> 05:06.097
That's the way it was in the '50s.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.348
NARRATOR: <i>It sure was.</i>

05:08.433 --> 05:12.854
<i>But that didn't bother the Wrathers.
In fact, they were drawn to the challenge.</i>

05:12.937 --> 05:16.858
Jack, throughout his whole life,
was always looking for what was new,

05:16.941 --> 05:19.986
what was... what was about to happen,
or what was about to break.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.030
DONALD: <i>Sort of a visionary, if you will.</i>

05:22.113 --> 05:23.489
NARRATOR: <i>And so was Walt Disney.</i>

05:23.573 --> 05:27.368
<i>So, as long as these two visionaries
didn't go cross-eyed</i>

05:27.452 --> 05:30.163
<i>with double vision,
maybe the magic might happen.</i>

05:30.246 --> 05:31.873
-MICHAEL: <i>Mr. Wrather went home.</i>
-(car horn beeps)

05:31.956 --> 05:34.834
Had cocktails with Mrs. Wrather,
as they usually did.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.502
They talked over everything.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.796
One of his theories about business

05:38.880 --> 05:42.133
is to have only those things
that the family can enjoy.

05:42.216 --> 05:43.509
NARRATOR: <i>So, with that mentality,</i>

05:43.593 --> 05:46.179
<i>it didn't take them
many cocktails at all, and...</i>

05:46.262 --> 05:48.473
They decided they were gonna be
in the hotel business in Anaheim.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.807
Anaheim? Where's Anaheim?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.142
NARRATOR: <i>It's here.</i>

05:51.225 --> 05:54.854
<i>So, as if by magic, Jack Wrather,
the oil man,</i>

05:54.937 --> 05:58.316
<i>teamed up with Walt Disney,
the guy with the animation studio,</i>

05:58.399 --> 06:02.028
<i>agreeing to build an experimental type
of new hotel</i>

06:02.111 --> 06:05.490
<i>next to an experimental type
of family destination</i>

06:05.573 --> 06:07.325
<i>in an orange grove in the desert</i>

06:07.408 --> 06:09.535
<i>in the middle
of a town no one had heard of,</i>

06:09.619 --> 06:13.539
<i>with no prior models to go by,
and no track record of success.</i>

06:13.623 --> 06:14.832
<i>No problem.</i>

06:15.416 --> 06:17.126
<i>So, the visionaries got to work</i>

06:17.210 --> 06:20.713
<i>and signed on the dotted line in this
equally shared venture.</i>

06:20.797 --> 06:21.964
Jack would own the hotel.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.508
NARRATOR: <i>Wait. Jack would own it?</i>

06:23.591 --> 06:25.885
Mm-hmm, yep.
But it would have the Disney name.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.136
NARRATOR: <i>Interesting.</i>

06:27.220 --> 06:32.100
The original deal gave Jack Wrather
the rights to lease 60 acres.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.060
NARRATOR: <i>Sixty acres of dirt.</i>

06:34.143 --> 06:36.229
<i>At least until Disneyland was up
and running,</i>

06:36.312 --> 06:37.730
<i>and then they could renegotiate.</i>

06:37.814 --> 06:39.482
-And it was a 99-year lease.
-NARRATOR: <i>Whoa!</i>

06:39.565 --> 06:42.068
So, he had it till 2054.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.236
NARRATOR: <i>That's not a bad deal.</i>

06:43.319 --> 06:46.531
Yeah. And he could use the Disneyland name

06:46.614 --> 06:50.118
in any hotel he chose to build anywhere
in the United States.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.787
NARRATOR:
<i>So, with an enormous amount of trust,</i>

06:52.870 --> 06:56.833
<i>Walt Disney relinquished his name
to the Wrathers,</i>

06:56.916 --> 07:00.378
<i>who were free to plonk a Disney hotel
wherever they fancied.</i>

07:00.461 --> 07:01.671
That was a very big deal.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.922
NARRATOR: <i>But first things first.</i>

07:03.005 --> 07:04.966
<i>As the two great visionaries</i>

07:05.049 --> 07:08.636
<i>set about bringing
two very different visions to life,</i>

07:08.803 --> 07:12.515
<i>the spirit of innovation
was at the forefront of everything</i>

07:12.598 --> 07:14.600
<i>they were both trying to achieve.</i>

07:14.684 --> 07:18.855
<i>And great innovation starts
with a great big pile of ideas,</i>

07:18.938 --> 07:22.191
<i>and it was up to Jack's team
to create said pile.</i>

07:22.275 --> 07:25.653
And when you did have an idea,
he'd ask lots of questions.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.656
But if he liked it... magic!

07:28.739 --> 07:30.032
It was done.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.577
Cost not important.

07:32.785 --> 07:36.456
NARRATOR: <i>And some of those
"cost not important" ideas included...</i>

07:36.539 --> 07:40.668
Uh, electrical outlets that the kids
couldn't reach or, or... hurt themselves

07:40.751 --> 07:42.003
or shock themselves.

07:42.086 --> 07:45.047
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, but... not exactly worth
driving across town for.</i>

07:45.131 --> 07:46.257
<i>What else you got?</i>

07:46.340 --> 07:48.259
Uh, we did have TVs in the room.

07:48.342 --> 07:51.762
MAN 2: <i>Each guest room boasts
its own TV set and private patio.</i>

07:51.846 --> 07:53.931
Which was still a novelty back then.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.433
NARRATOR:
<i>But there were plenty more novelties</i>

07:55.516 --> 07:56.517
<i>where that came from.</i>

07:56.601 --> 07:57.560
MAN 4: <i>Completely air conditioned.</i>

07:57.643 --> 08:00.354
DONALD: <i>They had beds that folded out
from the wall</i>

08:00.438 --> 08:01.689
<i>where two kids could sleep in.</i>

08:01.772 --> 08:05.610
MAN 2: <i>Here at Disneyland Hotel,
the small fry receive first consideration.</i>

08:05.818 --> 08:08.571
NARRATOR: <i>But don't worry, the big fry
were a very close second.</i>

08:08.654 --> 08:09.572
Cheers!

08:09.655 --> 08:11.574
DONALD: <i>They had convention facilities
so that Dad</i>

08:11.657 --> 08:13.743
<i>could go to the convention there
during the day...</i>

08:14.035 --> 08:15.703
MAN 2: <i>If a meeting
of the board of directors is in order,</i>

08:15.786 --> 08:18.414
<i>this specially designed room
is just the thing.</i>

08:18.498 --> 08:21.083
...and Mom could bring the kids
to Disneyland.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.170
MAN 2: <i>Or stay here and relax
while the kids do the amusements.</i>

08:24.253 --> 08:26.464
<i>That's a vacation for the whole family.</i>

08:26.547 --> 08:28.591
These are features
that not every hotel had.

08:28.674 --> 08:32.720
NARRATOR: <i>And, with all these amenities
for the typical family of the 1950s,</i>

08:32.803 --> 08:35.431
<i>it sounded like a lovely place to stay.</i>

08:35.515 --> 08:38.267
<i>But for the employees working
under Jack Wrather?</i>

08:38.351 --> 08:40.228
<i>They were lucky if they got to stay.</i>

08:40.311 --> 08:41.729
He was a... he was a taskmaster.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.564
NARRATOR: <i>And Michael Bullis would know,</i>

08:43.648 --> 08:47.276
<i>working under Jack and becoming
the hotel's general manager in the '80s.</i>

08:47.735 --> 08:51.072
He had quality standards,
and if you didn't, you didn't stay.

08:51.155 --> 08:55.201
DONALD: <i>They knew it took him 45 minutes
to drive from the Beverly Hills office</i>

08:55.868 --> 08:59.372
to the hotel,
so they called it "the 45-minute warning."

09:00.540 --> 09:01.624
<i>And they would be scrambling,</i>

09:01.707 --> 09:03.751
like picking up every single piece
of paper on the property

09:03.834 --> 09:05.127
or every dead flower,

09:05.211 --> 09:08.214
<i>because they knew how particular
he was on the hotel</i>

09:08.297 --> 09:10.591
<i>and how he wanted everything in its place.</i>

09:10.675 --> 09:12.343
NARRATOR: <i>As did Bonnie Wrather.</i>

09:12.593 --> 09:13.678
I joined Pereira...

09:13.761 --> 09:16.180
NARRATOR: <i>That's the hotel's architect,
William Pereira.</i>

09:16.264 --> 09:18.891
BONITA: <i>...in the interior decoration
of the hotel,</i>

09:18.975 --> 09:21.561
and the whole budget was sort of
in our hands, so...

09:21.686 --> 09:23.354
I might add I came in on budget, too.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.313
(both chuckles)

09:24.397 --> 09:25.982
NARRATOR: <i>But not exactly on time.</i>

09:26.065 --> 09:29.402
-Disneyland opened July 17th, 1955.
-Welcome.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.028
NARRATOR:
<i>But as for the Disneyland Hotel...</i>

09:31.112 --> 09:34.323
The Disneyland Hotel opened
October 5th, 1955.

09:34.407 --> 09:38.286
NARRATOR: <i>And when it did, unsurprisingly,
it was the place to stay.</i>

09:38.369 --> 09:40.997
MAN 2: <i>Just a stone's throw
from world-famous Disneyland</i>

09:41.080 --> 09:43.416
<i>is the luxurious new Disneyland Hotel.</i>

09:43.708 --> 09:45.585
<i>This handsome,
ten million-dollar structure</i>

09:45.668 --> 09:47.128
<i>is the culmination of a dream,</i>

09:47.211 --> 09:49.463
<i>for Dallas industrialist Jack Wrather</i>

09:49.547 --> 09:51.882
<i>has transformed a 30-acre orange grove</i>

09:51.966 --> 09:54.302
<i>into this internationally
known resort hotel.</i>

09:54.385 --> 09:57.847
And I think, the first night,
they had over 400 people wanting a room.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.682
NARRATOR:
<i>And of course it was fully booked.</i>

09:59.765 --> 10:03.060
<i>But they weren't quite
at operating capacity just yet.</i>

10:03.144 --> 10:04.395
They had seven open.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.438
NARRATOR: <i>Seven?</i>

10:05.521 --> 10:06.897
The rest of the rooms
were still under construction.

10:06.981 --> 10:07.815
NARRATOR: <i>Uh-oh!</i>

10:07.898 --> 10:11.944
At the time, all of the plumbers
and the electricians and the carpenters

10:12.028 --> 10:13.362
<i>and the pavers, you know,</i>

10:13.446 --> 10:15.531
they were in a rush
to complete Disneyland.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.450
<i>♪ Let's keep on building all day long ♪</i>

10:17.533 --> 10:20.411
<i>♪ Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,
heigh-ho, heigh-ho... ♪</i>

10:20.494 --> 10:24.123
And the minute they finished Disneyland,
they went over and they started

10:24.206 --> 10:26.417
finishing and building
the Disneyland Hotel.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.961
NARRATOR:
<i>If you were one of the lucky seven</i>

10:29.045 --> 10:31.130
<i>on the Disneyland Hotel's opening night...</i>

10:31.213 --> 10:32.590
They were nine dollars a room.

10:32.673 --> 10:36.093
There was no pool, no restaurants.
You know, it was just the room.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.762
NARRATOR: <i>And the safety sockets!</i>

10:37.845 --> 10:39.305
It looked like a mad scramble.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.682
Everybody was running around
from place to place.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.810
But I think within a week,
they had all hundred rooms open.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.604
You know, definitely a soft opening.

10:46.687 --> 10:50.358
NARRATOR: <i>But the Wrathers were socialites
and ex-movie stars.</i>

10:50.441 --> 10:54.153
<i>Surely it's unlike them to miss
an opportunity for a grand opening.</i>

10:54.779 --> 10:55.988
<i>Ah, they didn't!</i>

10:56.072 --> 10:58.449
DAVID: <i>The grand opening was in 1956,</i>

10:58.532 --> 11:00.868
and that was an all-celebrity,
star-studded event.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.580
The press was there.
Walt Disney was there.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.540
Thank you so much for coming, Walt.

11:06.624 --> 11:10.127
DONALD: <i>There were screen stars
of the '50s, dignitaries and politicians.</i>

11:10.211 --> 11:13.089
NARRATOR:
<i>But, really, it was one big, long party</i>

11:13.172 --> 11:15.132
<i>for Walt Disney and the Wrathers.</i>

11:15.216 --> 11:17.843
As the demand from the park
continued to grow...

11:17.927 --> 11:20.137
NARRATOR:
<i>Very quickly, the Wrathers realized...</i>

11:20.221 --> 11:21.514
...they needed to build more rooms.

11:21.597 --> 11:22.640
NARRATOR: <i>So, they did.</i>

11:22.723 --> 11:27.144
Within one year, they already
had gone to 300 rooms and were boasting

11:27.228 --> 11:29.855
that the Disneyland Hotel
could actually sleep four people

11:29.939 --> 11:31.273
<i>per night per room.</i>

11:31.357 --> 11:33.317
NARRATOR: <i>Impressive numbers, to be sure!</i>

11:33.401 --> 11:35.820
Which was big for Anaheim,
because there wasn't a lot of hotels.

11:35.903 --> 11:38.489
NARRATOR: <i>But Walt Disney
was racking up, arguably,</i>

11:38.572 --> 11:40.408
<i>even more impressive numbers.</i>

11:40.491 --> 11:41.826
<i>In just seven weeks,</i>

11:41.909 --> 11:44.787
<i>Disneyland had welcomed
over one million guests.</i>

11:44.870 --> 11:46.580
<i>Come on, Wrathers, step it up!</i>

11:46.664 --> 11:51.460
By August of 1956, they now had
eight guest accommodation structures.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.921
-NARRATOR: <i>And...</i>
-RONALD: <i>Olympic-size swimming pool.</i>

11:54.004 --> 11:56.507
-NARRATOR: <i>There were plenty of...</i>
-Different restaurants on property.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.008
-NARRATOR: <i>As well as...</i>
-RONALD: <i>Shopping.</i>

11:58.092 --> 12:00.720
-NARRATOR: <i>There was...</i>
-Full baby-sitting services there.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.847
DONALD: <i>They had little shows
that the kids could attend</i>

12:02.930 --> 12:06.142
<i>during the day if the parents wanted
to get out and have their own dinner.</i>

12:06.225 --> 12:08.477
NARRATOR: <i>And if you were overwhelmed
by those amenities...</i>

12:08.561 --> 12:10.312
-They even had a liquor store.
-NARRATOR: <i>However...</i>

12:10.396 --> 12:12.815
DONALD: <i>Disney made them take down
the sign that said "liquors."</i>

12:12.898 --> 12:14.483
<i>But you could buy liquors there.</i>

12:14.567 --> 12:16.861
NARRATOR: <i>And if you got a headache
from said liquors...</i>

12:16.944 --> 12:20.072
They had a full pharmacy and sundries.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.907
NARRATOR: <i>It's all sounding very much like</i>

12:21.991 --> 12:24.326
<i>one of today's five-star hotels
or resorts.</i>

12:24.410 --> 12:26.495
They had a camera shop, a beauty salon...

12:26.579 --> 12:27.872
MAN 5: <i>We have experts</i>

12:27.955 --> 12:30.875
<i>dedicated to keeping you
looking and feeling your best.</i>

12:31.041 --> 12:34.420
NARRATOR: <i>But keep in mind
this was all new for a hotel.</i>

12:34.503 --> 12:36.922
MAN 2: <i>One of the most modern
and interesting resort hotels</i>

12:37.006 --> 12:38.048
<i>in the world today.</i>

12:38.132 --> 12:39.675
NARRATOR: <i>And then, there were the things</i>

12:39.759 --> 12:42.720
<i>that you don't generally find
in hotels today.</i>

12:42.803 --> 12:45.473
-A dentist was located on facilities.
-NARRATOR: <i>A dentist?</i>

12:45.556 --> 12:48.184
DONALD: <i>They had a doctor
that was located there part-time.</i>

12:48.267 --> 12:52.062
NARRATOR: <i>But it gets way cooler
than ping-pong tables and dentists,</i>

12:52.146 --> 12:55.900
<i>because the Disneyland Hotel
had... a radio.</i>

12:56.692 --> 12:59.445
<i>Oh, sorry. A radio station!</i>

12:59.528 --> 13:03.491
There was a live radio station in there.
KEZY was added.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.286
DONALD" <i>Uh, and they broadcast live
all day long from the Disneyland Hotel.</i>

13:07.369 --> 13:09.830
<i>They had an easy
listening radio station there.</i>

13:09.914 --> 13:14.293
And that was, when you think about it,
very, very ahead of its time.

13:14.376 --> 13:18.422
NARRATOR: <i>Well, hang on. It wasn't FM.
But what it was...</i>

13:18.506 --> 13:22.259
It was, to me, the beginnings
of experience-based hotel.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.804
No longer just a place to sleep, but...

13:24.887 --> 13:26.764
BHAVNA:
<i>You wanna take a break from the park,</i>

13:26.847 --> 13:28.307
<i>you wanna go back to the hotel,</i>

13:28.390 --> 13:31.227
<i>you could have experiences by the pool
or a restaurant.</i>

13:31.310 --> 13:34.647
NARRATOR: <i>Take a break from the park?
That's crazy talk!</i>

13:35.105 --> 13:36.732
<i>Before you walk back to the hotel</i>

13:36.816 --> 13:39.068
<i>and pull that bed down
off the wall to take a nap...</i>

13:39.151 --> 13:41.028
We had our own trams
that would take our guests

13:41.111 --> 13:43.989
<i>from the Disneyland Hotel
to the front door of Disneyland.</i>

13:44.073 --> 13:45.783
NARRATOR: <i>And back again, of course,</i>

13:45.866 --> 13:49.787
<i>keeping your leg strength entirely intact
for where you'll need it.</i>

13:49.870 --> 13:53.290
<i>But soon enough, even at Disneyland,
you could get around the park</i>

13:53.374 --> 13:54.583
<i>by putting your feet up.</i>

13:54.667 --> 13:58.295
Disneyland added the monorail in 1959.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.797
Now, you know
how to cut a ribbon, don't you?

13:59.880 --> 14:02.466
DONALD: <i>It was a little under a mile.
It was eight-tenths of a mile.</i>

14:02.550 --> 14:05.094
But it only circled
around inside the park.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.887
MAN 6: <i>There they go. There's the nose.</i>

14:06.971 --> 14:10.349
NARRATOR: <i>But as usual,
Walt had bigger plans for his monorail...</i>

14:10.432 --> 14:12.601
And he wanted to try it out somewhere.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.520
NARRATOR: <i>But not somewhere too far away.</i>

14:14.603 --> 14:16.522
He went to Jack Wrather and said,

14:16.605 --> 14:20.067
"Hey, you know,
let's run this over to your hotel."

14:20.150 --> 14:22.611
Jack Wrather jumped on it and said,
"Yes, let's do it."

14:23.195 --> 14:25.614
NARRATOR:
<i>In fact, the Wrathers were all aboard,</i>

14:25.698 --> 14:28.200
<i>even splitting the cost
of the track extension</i>

14:28.284 --> 14:29.827
<i>to the hotel with Walt!</i>

14:29.910 --> 14:31.954
DONALD:
<i>They announced it in December of 1960,</i>

14:32.037 --> 14:35.583
<i>they built its own monorail station
at the Disneyland Hotel,</i>

14:35.666 --> 14:37.543
<i>and it became a two-and-a-half-mile route</i>

14:37.626 --> 14:40.045
from the hotel into Tomorrowland
and the park.

14:40.129 --> 14:43.799
NARRATOR: <i>And like that,
the Disneyland Hotel had two stations:</i>

14:44.174 --> 14:47.887
<i>one for easy listening,
and one for easy transport.</i>

14:47.970 --> 14:49.471
WALT: <i>Why, everyone agrees</i>

14:49.555 --> 14:53.475
<i>that Disneyland Hotel
is a very special place.</i>

14:54.018 --> 14:56.520
It was a... a game-changer, you know.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.647
I mean, what hotel in the world
would have a monorail

14:58.731 --> 15:01.692
that would pull up to the hotel?
Only us, right?

15:01.775 --> 15:04.945
NARRATOR: <i>Right. But the monorail
wasn't just a game-changer.</i>

15:05.029 --> 15:09.950
The monorail was an entry
into the park... that nobody else had.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.118
NARRATOR: <i>That's right!</i>

15:11.201 --> 15:14.038
MAN 5: <i>You can board the express
to the world-famous Magic Kingdom.</i>

15:14.121 --> 15:15.915
NARRATOR: <i>But not to the front gate.</i>

15:15.998 --> 15:19.293
You could enter the park
into the middle of the park

15:19.960 --> 15:21.211
<i>first thing in the morning.</i>

15:21.462 --> 15:24.381
MICHAEL: <i>And you didn't wait in lines
for the main gate.</i>

15:24.465 --> 15:26.425
And... and, of course, nobody had that.

15:26.508 --> 15:30.346
That was a, uh, a critical selling point,
you know, of the hotel.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.557
NARRATOR:
<i>Within just five years of opening,</i>

15:33.641 --> 15:37.436
<i>the Disneyland Hotel boasted 300 rooms</i>

15:37.519 --> 15:41.690
<i>and a monorail that gave you
exclusive access to Disneyland.</i>

15:41.774 --> 15:45.110
<i>Really, what more could you want?
Actually, quite a bit.</i>

15:45.194 --> 15:47.613
In '61, they added the Monorail Lounge.

15:48.113 --> 15:52.159
This was a place where you could go
to sit and watch the monorail come in.

15:52.242 --> 15:55.162
NARRATOR: <i>And nothing complements
monorail spotting</i>

15:55.245 --> 15:58.582
<i>like a good, old-fashioned Old Fashioned.</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:01.669
<i>Or maybe a Blue Hawaiian
or a Mai Tai, because...</i>

16:01.752 --> 16:04.463
It was one of the only places
that served alcohol.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.714
Oh, there's no booze in the park.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.092
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, the Disneyland Hotel had plenty.</i>

16:08.175 --> 16:09.718
We have 16 bars and restaurants.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.387
NARRATOR: <i>And the much-needed pharmacy...</i>

16:11.470 --> 16:14.974
And so, they came over
for their little toddies.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.227
NARRATOR: <i>And, if they needed it,
a little afternoon nap.</i>

16:19.269 --> 16:22.022
<i>But if you got a bit sick
of monorail spotting,</i>

16:22.231 --> 16:25.526
<i>there was plenty
of celebrity spotting to do.</i>

16:25.609 --> 16:28.404
All of the celebrities wanted to be
seen staying there.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.906
NARRATOR: <i>And we're not just talking
Mickey and Minnie.</i>

16:30.990 --> 16:33.826
<i>I mean, they're there.
But we're talking...</i>

16:33.909 --> 16:37.454
Marilyn Monroe, John F. Kennedy,
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, John Wayne...

16:37.538 --> 16:39.164
-NARRATOR: <i>This star-studded...</i>
-...Sean Connery...

16:39.248 --> 16:40.124
NARRATOR: <i>Whoa! Still going.</i>

16:40.207 --> 16:42.793
DONALD: <i>...Mick Jagger, Frank Sinatra,
Roger Moore,</i>

16:42.876 --> 16:44.128
and Steve McQueen staying there...

16:44.211 --> 16:47.840
NARRATOR: <i>And not just Hollywood royalty.
Royalty-royalty were checking in!</i>

16:47.923 --> 16:49.550
DONALD:
<i>...Prince Charles, the Shah of Iran...</i>

16:49.633 --> 16:50.843
-NARRATOR: <i>And...</i>
-DONALD: <i>Lyndon Johnson...</i>

16:50.926 --> 16:52.136
NARRATOR: <i>...we're done.</i>

16:52.219 --> 16:54.847
<i>But in any case, celebrities were hovering</i>

16:54.930 --> 16:57.725
<i>around the Disneyland Hotel
like helicopters,</i>

16:57.808 --> 17:00.853
<i>which, incidentally,
is probably how most of them arrived.</i>

17:00.936 --> 17:04.189
The helicopter, uh,
pad was installed in late '61.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.943
It was operated by, uh, LA Airways
at the Disneyland Hotel.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.073
It was 22 flights a day
and it was 15 dollars round trip.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.701
DONALD: <i>People liked it 'cause
they could go directly from LAX</i>

17:15.784 --> 17:18.245
<i>in these helicopters
right into the heliport</i>

17:18.328 --> 17:19.580
<i>at the Disneyland Hotel</i>

17:19.663 --> 17:23.083
'cause that drive from LAX
to the hotel sometimes,

17:23.167 --> 17:24.752
<i>with LA traffic, took quite a while.</i>

17:24.835 --> 17:27.046
NARRATOR: <i>Still, less than Beverly Hills.</i>

17:27.963 --> 17:32.009
<i>But by 1961, you didn't need a helicopter
to take to the skies,</i>

17:32.092 --> 17:34.887
<i>because the Disneyland Hotel was going up.</i>

17:34.970 --> 17:37.723
Jack Wrather started adding
some vertical tower,

17:37.806 --> 17:39.433
because the demand is there.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.351
The first tower was built in 1961.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.937
NARRATOR: <i>Bringing the total to 450 rooms.</i>

17:44.021 --> 17:45.939
They had an interesting glass elevator

17:46.023 --> 17:48.692
that was not quite halfway
across the building,

17:48.776 --> 17:51.737
<i>it was kind of more askewed to one side.</i>

17:51.820 --> 17:55.032
WALT: <i>Just a wonderful place for
small or large groups of people to meet.</i>

17:55.115 --> 17:57.451
NARRATOR:
<i>All this expansion of the Disneyland Hotel</i>

17:57.534 --> 18:01.705
<i>was a very good sign for the future,
unlike the actual sign.</i>

18:01.789 --> 18:05.709
What had happened
was they could only fit the word "hotel"

18:05.793 --> 18:08.253
<i>on one side of it and "Disneyland"
on the other side of it</i>

18:08.337 --> 18:11.256
because of the...
placement of the elevator.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.509
They couldn't put "Disneyland Hotel."

18:13.592 --> 18:15.844
And that led to a lot of people saying,

18:16.178 --> 18:18.972
"Is it the Hotel Disneyland
or is it the Disneyland Hotel?"

18:19.056 --> 18:19.932
NARRATOR: <i>Well...</i>

18:20.015 --> 18:22.434
<i>♪ Disneyland Hotel ♪</i>

18:22.518 --> 18:24.853
-NARRATOR: <i>It's that!</i>
-In a way I think that, uh...

18:24.937 --> 18:27.397
Wrather really looked at Disneyland Hotel
kind of like

18:27.481 --> 18:29.441
as his own little personal Disneyland.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.152
NARRATOR: <i>Both Walt Disney
and Jack Wrather had achieved</i>

18:32.236 --> 18:37.157
<i>something absolutely astonishing,
building their own personal playgrounds</i>

18:37.241 --> 18:39.868
<i>to be shared
among all the people of the world.</i>

18:40.410 --> 18:43.330
<i>And for most, that would be enough.</i>

18:43.789 --> 18:45.749
<i>However, it's at this point in the story</i>

18:45.833 --> 18:49.336
<i>that we must leave the Wrathers
in California for now, at least.</i>

18:49.837 --> 18:55.509
<i>Because, for Walt Disney, the world
was his playground. Disney World!</i>

18:55.884 --> 19:01.932
Walt Disney, who will bring
a new world of entertainment, pleasure

19:02.349 --> 19:05.060
and economic development
to the State of Florida. Walt Disney.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.564
NARRATOR: <i>And Florida was where Walt
was taking Disneyland next.</i>

19:08.647 --> 19:09.481
<i>But this time...</i>

19:09.565 --> 19:12.860
Walt Disney went looking for land
to expand on the East Coast.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.278
He said, "At this time,

19:14.361 --> 19:17.364
I want to buy enough land
to build not only the park,

19:17.447 --> 19:23.120
but also build all the hotel rooms
that we want to build for our guests."

19:23.203 --> 19:25.581
NARRATOR: <i>But Walt didn't want
to build just hotel rooms,</i>

19:25.664 --> 19:28.375
<i>he wanted to build something much more.</i>

19:28.458 --> 19:32.671
BHAVNA: <i>Walt wanted guests to feel like
when they're there in the hotel rooms,</i>

19:32.754 --> 19:33.964
the story didn't break.

19:34.047 --> 19:36.008
NARRATOR:
<i>And Walt desperately wanted to know...</i>

19:36.091 --> 19:39.720
How can we allow the guest to stay
in that magic? And that's really the key.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.471
STOFCIK: <i>You're not going home
after the fireworks.</i>

19:41.555 --> 19:44.016
<i>You're staying there
for an extended period of time.</i>

19:44.099 --> 19:46.018
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, staying in the magic.</i>

19:46.101 --> 19:47.311
And that's really the key.

19:47.394 --> 19:50.814
NARRATOR: <i>But for a family to want to stay
in a hotel</i>

19:50.898 --> 19:54.693
<i>for more than just a couple of nights,
it would have to be more than magic.</i>

19:54.776 --> 19:56.445
So, that's why he bought so much land.

19:56.528 --> 20:00.115
NARRATOR: <i>With a whopping 27,000 acres
to work with...</i>

20:00.199 --> 20:03.243
Twice the size of the island of Manhattan.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.704
NARRATOR: <i>...Disney World
would be his playground.</i>

20:05.787 --> 20:09.374
He set a global mindset to places,
exotic locations, right?

20:09.833 --> 20:12.044
STOFCIK: <i>It was only 20 years
after the golden age of travel.</i>

20:12.127 --> 20:13.587
<i>It was still very expensive</i>

20:13.670 --> 20:16.131
<i>for the average consumer
to travel those places,</i>

20:16.215 --> 20:17.841
<i>so Walt was gonna give you those.</i>

20:17.925 --> 20:20.886
NARRATOR: <i>So, Walt not only wanted
to keep you in the magic,</i>

20:21.178 --> 20:25.766
<i>but he wanted to do it by taking you
to the world's most exotic locations!</i>

20:25.849 --> 20:27.851
In all the hotels
around Seven Seas Lagoon,

20:27.935 --> 20:31.271
<i>you have the Asian and the Persian
and the Venetian and the Polynesian</i>

20:31.355 --> 20:32.356
<i>and the Contemporary.</i>

20:32.439 --> 20:35.317
NARRATOR: <i>It was all systems go
for the Florida Project,</i>

20:35.400 --> 20:38.570
<i>and it seemed that there was nothing
that could stop Walt Disney.</i>

20:39.154 --> 20:40.030
<i>Except...</i>

20:41.031 --> 20:42.074
<i>this.</i>

20:42.157 --> 20:43.909
DONALD: <i>Walt Disney had passed away.</i>

20:43.992 --> 20:47.454
The Wrather family wrote to Roy Disney,
grief-stricken,

20:47.537 --> 20:49.873
"We're heartbroken that Walt passed away."

20:49.957 --> 20:53.543
<i>"We've had such a wonderful relationship
with... with Walt and you,"</i>

20:53.627 --> 20:57.631
and saying, "If there's anything we can do
about the Disney World project..."

20:57.714 --> 21:00.217
NARRATOR: <i>But here's the thing about
the Walt Disney Company...</i>

21:00.300 --> 21:02.094
In 1954, they have no money.

21:02.177 --> 21:08.600
They have no knowledge on hotels.
In 1966, 1967, they have tons of money.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.560
They have tons of people
that they can hire.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.312
DONALD: <i>They wanna do everything
themselves.</i>

21:12.771 --> 21:16.024
NARRATOR: <i>It was now all up
to Walt Disney's big brother, Roy,</i>

21:16.108 --> 21:18.527
<i>to forge ahead for the legacy
of his brother</i>

21:18.944 --> 21:21.488
<i>and to secure the future of the company.</i>

21:21.571 --> 21:23.073
Roy was overwhelmed.

21:23.156 --> 21:25.033
NARRATOR: <i>Rightly so, but still...</i>

21:25.117 --> 21:28.328
It was decided that phase one opening,
there were two hotels be built...

21:28.495 --> 21:30.872
<i>the Contemporary and the Polynesian.</i>

21:30.956 --> 21:33.208
NARRATOR:
<i>And so now, instead of getting too stuck</i>

21:33.292 --> 21:35.168
<i>on transporting you around the world,</i>

21:35.252 --> 21:37.379
<i>Roy and the Imagineers leaned more</i>

21:37.462 --> 21:40.340
<i>into the idea
at the heart of Walt's vision.</i>

21:40.424 --> 21:42.509
How can we allow the guest
to stay in that magic?

21:42.592 --> 21:46.305
NARRATOR: <i>Well, by literally staying
in that Magic Kingdom.</i>

21:46.388 --> 21:49.266
The Contemporary was an extension
of Tomorrowland.

21:49.349 --> 21:53.145
<i>The Polynesian hotel is a connection to...</i>

21:53.228 --> 21:57.482
MAN 7: <i>Adventureland the wonder world
of nature's own realm.</i>

21:57.566 --> 21:59.609
NARRATOR: <i>But not actually its own world.</i>

21:59.693 --> 22:02.321
<i>It's just a short five-minute
monorail ride away,</i>

22:02.404 --> 22:04.323
<i>but it was supposed to be closer.</i>

22:04.406 --> 22:07.284
Polynesian originally was supposed
to be across the lake,

22:07.367 --> 22:09.286
<i>directly adjacent to Adventureland.</i>

22:09.369 --> 22:10.996
STOFCIK: <i>But the soils weren't suitable,</i>

22:11.079 --> 22:13.707
so they pulled it back
and allowed the landscaping

22:13.790 --> 22:17.419
and the palms of Adventureland
to be that backdrop to the hotel itself.

22:17.502 --> 22:20.213
NARRATOR: <i>And part of that backdrop
came from the Jungle Cruise.</i>

22:20.297 --> 22:24.468
Be careful in the back, now. We don't want
a python snake to get a crush on you.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.970
NARRATOR:
<i>And that tie-in is no coincidence.</i>

22:27.054 --> 22:29.848
And we're always looking
for, you know, as we're doing the hotel,

22:29.931 --> 22:31.600
<i>finding those connection points.</i>

22:31.683 --> 22:32.684
NARRATOR: <i>What, these points?</i>

22:32.768 --> 22:36.104
And not have it be
empty patterning is really important.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.315
NARRATOR:
<i>Even though these exciting new hotels</i>

22:38.398 --> 22:41.276
<i>would be exclusively
in Walt Disney World...</i>

22:41.360 --> 22:43.570
They actually pre-fabricated
all the rooms.

22:43.653 --> 22:46.990
NARRATOR: <i>In an effort to minimize cost
and maximize innovation,</i>

22:47.074 --> 22:51.411
<i>the architects really thought outside
the box, even though...</i>

22:51.495 --> 22:54.998
It's a box, rectangular box,
that we're able to...

22:55.082 --> 22:57.209
<i>not only put it in the structure frame,</i>

22:57.292 --> 23:00.879
<i>but also, we're able to put
all the wiring, all the plumbing,</i>

23:01.338 --> 23:03.465
<i>and all the plumbing fixtures
for the bathrooms.</i>

23:03.548 --> 23:06.718
So, they actually slid the rooms
into place in the Contemporary,

23:06.802 --> 23:09.805
and they actually dropped them
in and stacked them up at the Polynesian,

23:09.888 --> 23:11.973
which was really innovative for the time.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.976
NARRATOR:
<i>As the boxes slid and stacked into place,</i>

23:15.268 --> 23:18.897
<i>something was becoming glaringly obvious
at the Contemporary.</i>

23:18.980 --> 23:21.400
So, from Tomorrowland,
you can see the hotel.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.068
NARRATOR: <i>Is that okay?</i>

23:23.151 --> 23:25.237
And that's okay, because it was
purposely designed to be that way.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.238
-NARRATOR: <i>Phew!</i>
-Right?

23:26.321 --> 23:28.031
So... so, therefore,
it's part of the story.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.783
The intention
was that if you were to see it

23:29.866 --> 23:33.370
from inside Tomorrowland,
it would feel like it belonged there.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.080
-NARRATOR: <i>Because...</i>
-It's futuristic.

23:35.330 --> 23:39.084
NARRATOR: <i>And who wouldn't want to see
this futuristic architectural masterpiece?</i>

23:39.543 --> 23:42.129
The first time I saw the Contemporary
was on the Sunday night

23:42.212 --> 23:44.047
Wonderful World of Disney,
the opening credits.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.382
NARRATOR: <i>You mean these opening credits?</i>

23:45.465 --> 23:48.135
ANNOUNCER 3:
<i>The Wonderful World of Disney.</i>

23:49.010 --> 23:51.972
And that monorail going to the building,
then coming out the other end,

23:52.055 --> 23:56.309
it was like, as a kid from India,
I was like, "Whoa! What just happened?"

23:56.393 --> 23:57.978
NARRATOR:
<i>Wait a minute. What did just happen?</i>

23:58.228 --> 23:59.813
<i>A monorail going through the building?</i>

23:59.896 --> 24:01.815
-Then coming out the other end.
-It's futuristic.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.191
NARRATOR: <i>But it's contemporary.</i>

24:03.400 --> 24:07.529
<i>Anyway, the Contemporary
is an artwork in itself, but...</i>

24:07.612 --> 24:09.990
There's a lot of places
that do a beautiful facade,

24:10.073 --> 24:13.201
and then when you go through the doors,
"What did I walk into?"

24:13.285 --> 24:15.162
NARRATOR: <i>A monorail station?</i>

24:15.245 --> 24:16.580
<i>For 1971,</i>

24:16.663 --> 24:20.292
<i>the inside of the Contemporary's
Grand Canyon Concourse</i>

24:20.375 --> 24:25.297
<i>was just as impressive as the outside.
And Disney's best artist made sure of it.</i>

24:25.380 --> 24:30.802
The Grand Concourse Mural
is a gorgeous mosaic mural

24:30.886 --> 24:33.930
<i>in the Contemporary Resort Hotel
at Walt Disney World.</i>

24:34.014 --> 24:36.558
VANESSA: <i>It has been there
since the hotel opened.</i>

24:36.641 --> 24:39.644
<i>And it is 100 percent Mary Blair.</i>

24:39.728 --> 24:43.148
<i>The color palette is all Mary,
the styling is all Mary.</i>

24:43.231 --> 24:46.067
NARRATOR: <i>The little children of the world
are all Mary, too.</i>

24:46.151 --> 24:49.654
<i>That's right, Mary Blair
was in large part responsible</i>

24:49.738 --> 24:51.990
<i>for the design of "It's a Small World."</i>

24:52.073 --> 24:54.242
VANESSA: <i>To this day,
fans sort of just stare at it.</i>

24:54.326 --> 24:56.578
I'm guilty of that myself.
(laughing)

24:56.661 --> 25:00.040
NARRATOR: <i>Don't feel guilty,
because standing at 90 feet tall,</i>

25:00.540 --> 25:05.712
<i>the mural has 18,000 hand-painted tiles.
And not only that...</i>

25:06.129 --> 25:07.839
-There is a goat...
-(goat bleats)

25:07.923 --> 25:10.175
...on the mural that has five legs.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.760
NARRATOR: <i>A bit weird. Why?</i>

25:11.843 --> 25:12.928
I don't know why.

25:13.011 --> 25:16.139
I don't know if that was maybe a mistake
when they were putting the mural together,

25:16.223 --> 25:18.767
or if that's something
Mary intentionally put in there.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.311
He technically has five legs.

25:21.394 --> 25:24.022
I don't know. I would be...
I... that is a great mystery.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.565
Was it intentional? Who knows?

25:25.649 --> 25:28.693
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, it is just a small leg, after all.</i>

25:28.777 --> 25:30.362
-(cheering)
-NARRATOR: <i>Thank you.</i>

25:30.445 --> 25:35.367
<i>As for the design of the Polynesian,
its inspiration came from Adventureland.</i>

25:35.450 --> 25:37.827
The Polynesian
was taking its inspirational,

25:38.370 --> 25:41.623
uh, design and its... its architecture
from Polynesian villages,

25:41.706 --> 25:44.376
so you see their, like,
hipped-roof architecture

25:44.459 --> 25:46.878
that looks like these Polynesian villages,
it makes a statement.

25:46.962 --> 25:50.549
NARRATOR: <i>Those details were extended
to the resort's interior as well.</i>

25:50.632 --> 25:52.759
Therefore, the materials for the walls,

25:52.842 --> 25:56.263
<i>you know, the chairs and the ceiling,
uh, the wood,</i>

25:56.346 --> 26:00.600
<i>you know, the rattan, the bamboo,
and the colors, the fabrics,</i>

26:00.684 --> 26:05.021
would truly be integrated as part
of the overall storytelling.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.107
NARRATOR: <i>And since this is a story,</i>

26:07.190 --> 26:09.693
<i>there's still a little room
for the imagination.</i>

26:09.776 --> 26:13.989
It may not be authentic,
but it's escapist.

26:14.072 --> 26:17.242
NARRATOR: <i>And as the story
of Walt Disney World unfolded...</i>

26:17.325 --> 26:20.745
The attendance exceeded
everyone's expectations.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.038
NARRATOR: <i>It surely did.</i>

26:22.122 --> 26:26.251
<i>And with the massive influx of tourists
pouring into Central Florida...</i>

26:26.334 --> 26:27.419
-Well, guess what.
-NARRATOR: <i>What?</i>

26:27.502 --> 26:28.753
Then we need more hotel rooms.

26:28.837 --> 26:29.879
NARRATOR: <i>So, to do this,</i>

26:29.963 --> 26:33.049
<i>the Imagineers scoured the world
for fresh ideas.</i>

26:33.133 --> 26:34.175
<i>And if not the world...</i>

26:34.259 --> 26:36.928
So, we would look at, you know,
Sunday travel sections.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.305
Where do people have vacations?

26:38.388 --> 26:43.560
Every hotel we would design reflects
where people would like to travel to.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.770
You weren't just coming
to a piece of architecture.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.231
It was a total resort destination.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.358
STOFCIK: <i>It was the costumes
of the cast members.</i>

26:50.442 --> 26:52.027
<i>It was the music. It was the food.</i>

26:52.110 --> 26:54.613
All reinforced that story
and that narrative.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.364
<i>It was the total destination.</i>

26:56.448 --> 26:59.117
NARRATOR: <i>And for Disney,
a very important realization</i>

26:59.200 --> 27:01.995
<i>of how they were going to make
hotels henceforth!</i>

27:02.078 --> 27:05.165
So, Disney got into the hotel business
not because we're a hotel company,

27:05.415 --> 27:06.625
<i>like all the brand hotel.</i>

27:06.708 --> 27:09.669
No. Because it's good
for our guests' experience.

27:09.753 --> 27:14.382
NARRATOR: <i>An experience that begins
the second you check in to a Disney hotel,</i>

27:14.466 --> 27:17.886
<i>not the moment you walk through
those turnstiles at the park.</i>

27:18.345 --> 27:24.225
<i>Because when you enter that hotel lobby
and look upwards at a five-legged goat,</i>

27:24.309 --> 27:26.061
<i>you can't help but feel like....</i>

27:26.144 --> 27:28.104
My home is gone, right? Reality's gone.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.857
I've... I've entered
into a magical journey now.

27:30.940 --> 27:34.569
NARRATOR: <i>And by the early '70s,
the country was flanked by magic</i>

27:34.653 --> 27:37.572
<i>and magical journeys,
with the incredible Walt Disney World</i>

27:37.656 --> 27:40.325
<i>and its hotels in the east</i>

27:40.408 --> 27:43.787
<i>and the Wrathers' towering
Disneyland Hotel in the west.</i>

27:43.870 --> 27:46.414
Jack Wrather continued
to add more hotel rooms.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.250
NARRATOR: <i>He even added more pools,
because, come on.</i>

27:49.334 --> 27:51.670
We didn't have one pool.
We had three pools!

27:51.753 --> 27:53.755
And one of those
was associated to a sand beach.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.799
-NARRATOR: <i>It also had...</i>
-DONALD: <i>Granville's Steak House.</i>

27:55.882 --> 27:57.592
A new bar with a country western singer.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.469
-The Pavilion...
-MICHAEL: <i>Strolling mariachi.</i>

27:59.552 --> 28:01.471
-Stromboli's restaurant.
-Koi fishpond.

28:01.554 --> 28:02.806
NARRATOR: <i>Clearly, there was...</i>

28:02.889 --> 28:05.558
A constant progress.
Just like Disneyland, it...

28:05.642 --> 28:07.310
Disneyland Hotel is never finished.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.605
NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, it's not finished. There was...</i>

28:10.689 --> 28:13.316
-Cafe Via Verde.
-Hawaiian show on the marina.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.568
NARRATOR: <i>Uh, sorry. Did you say marina?</i>

28:15.652 --> 28:18.947
Jack Wrather wanted to build
a marina at the hotel.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.448
NARRATOR: <i>And so, he did!</i>

28:20.532 --> 28:22.826
He had these boats,
you know, in the marina.

28:22.909 --> 28:25.203
NARRATOR:
<i>It wasn't a particularly big marina,</i>

28:25.286 --> 28:28.123
<i>but it did have real boats,
not just these little ones.</i>

28:29.332 --> 28:31.376
BONITA: <i>And everyone
is always welcome aboard</i>

28:31.459 --> 28:33.044
<i>at our continuous boat show.</i>

28:33.128 --> 28:35.255
DONALD:
<i>Boats that people could actually look at,</i>

28:35.338 --> 28:38.174
that could potentially purchase
for their own use.

28:38.258 --> 28:41.553
NARRATOR: <i>And you thought Mickey ears were
the must-buy souvenir to take home!</i>

28:41.636 --> 28:44.681
<i>But don't be put off
by the expensive floating gift shop.</i>

28:44.764 --> 28:47.016
DAVID: <i>You go to the Disneyland Hotel,
it was free to get in.</i>

28:47.100 --> 28:49.310
We used to all go there
in high school on date night.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.562
That was a cheap date.

28:50.645 --> 28:51.813
NARRATOR: <i>Cheap, but effective.</i>

28:51.896 --> 28:55.150
You had these great opportunities
like the Polynesian show

28:55.233 --> 28:57.569
and of course the, uh, dancing waters.

28:57.652 --> 29:01.072
DAVID: <i>And it was a water, light,
music spectacular,</i>

29:01.156 --> 29:04.159
which was almost like a little precursor
to Fantasmic! today.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.954
NARRATOR: <i>Which in itself was a precursor
to "The World of Color"</i>

29:08.037 --> 29:10.081
<i>at Disney California Adventure Park.</i>

29:10.165 --> 29:12.125
And at night,
they had the ships all lit up

29:12.208 --> 29:15.420
<i>with a string of lights and everything.
It is a... a real beautiful scene.</i>

29:15.503 --> 29:18.339
NARRATOR:
<i>And if that wasn't romantic enough...</i>

29:18.423 --> 29:20.425
There was also one place
we used to hang out a lot,

29:20.508 --> 29:21.551
which was the arcade.

29:21.634 --> 29:24.387
DAVID: <i>And it had all of the old
1980s arcade games in it.</i>

29:24.471 --> 29:27.390
It was 3,500 square feet... underwater.

29:27.474 --> 29:31.186
NARRATOR: <i>This is the Atari Adventure
entertainment center!</i>

29:31.269 --> 29:34.522
So the kids could play the games
and look out into... in the marina.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.150
NARRATOR: <i>Pretty sure
they weren't looking out into the marina.</i>

29:37.233 --> 29:38.651
(beeping)

29:38.735 --> 29:43.239
NARRATOR: <i>But in any case, there was
a lot going on under the Disneyland Hotel.</i>

29:43.323 --> 29:45.492
You can drive trucks...

29:46.159 --> 29:48.828
underneath the grounds
of the Disneyland Hotel.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.705
MICHAEL: <i>You never saw room service.</i>

29:50.789 --> 29:54.334
You never saw maintenance people walking
the grounds, or housekeeping.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.544
They learned that
from Walt Disney and the park.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.964
NARRATOR: <i>However, as Jack and Bonnie
played doubles at Q*bert...</i>

30:00.048 --> 30:01.424
(beeping)

30:01.508 --> 30:03.885
<i>...it was obvious that the times
were changing,</i>

30:04.385 --> 30:07.972
<i>and the '80s ushered in a new era
for Disneyland,</i>

30:08.056 --> 30:10.558
<i>the Disneyland Hotel, and the world.</i>

30:10.642 --> 30:12.936
NARRATOR: <i>A world that, unfortunately,</i>

30:13.019 --> 30:15.605
<i>was about to change
for the Wrather family.</i>

30:15.688 --> 30:19.692
Jack Wrather got, uh, cancer in, uh, 1981.

30:21.444 --> 30:23.404
I got invited up to his house.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.657
Mrs. Wrather met me
at the door at their house

30:25.740 --> 30:28.076
and walked me back to the bedroom,
and he is sitting up.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.536
MICHAEL: <i>He'd gotten out of bed.</i>

30:29.619 --> 30:31.955
And he's sitting in a wing chair in his...
in his bedroom.

30:32.038 --> 30:34.332
And he just said,
"You know, I just wanted to say,

30:34.415 --> 30:36.417
you know, I appreciate all you've done."

30:36.501 --> 30:40.129
And, uh, and I'm at...
kind of at a loss for words.

30:40.213 --> 30:43.550
I don't know how to say something to a...
well, I think he's a great guy, um...

30:44.968 --> 30:47.720
And, uh, two days later, he died.

30:47.804 --> 30:52.267
NARRATOR: <i>On November 12th, 1984,
Jack Wrather passed away.</i>

30:53.977 --> 30:56.771
Sorry.
(exhales)

30:58.857 --> 31:04.112
He, uh, was loving. He's a loving person.
And he got things done.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.990
And he didn't... he collaborated.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.617
He just didn't come and say,
"Do this, do that."

31:09.701 --> 31:13.872
He collaborated. He asked questions.
Um, he was a great leader.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.248
NARRATOR: <i>But with Jack gone,</i>

31:15.331 --> 31:18.751
<i>control of his company
fell to his youngest son, Chris.</i>

31:18.835 --> 31:20.753
DONALD: <i>It's not what Chris
really wanted to do.</i>

31:20.837 --> 31:24.048
But because his name
was Wrather and because, you know,

31:24.132 --> 31:26.551
that was who they wanted to run
the company,

31:26.634 --> 31:28.678
that's what he ended up having to do.

31:28.761 --> 31:30.972
NARRATOR:
<i>And with a lease that expired in...</i>

31:31.055 --> 31:32.432
2054.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.851
NARRATOR: <i>There were only
about 70 years to go.</i>

31:35.226 --> 31:39.480
<i>And that raised some concerns
for another name that had become</i>

31:39.564 --> 31:44.736
<i>very important in the Disney organization,
CEO Michael Eisner.</i>

31:44.819 --> 31:47.363
Michael Eisner did not like that

31:47.447 --> 31:50.325
because if somebody would have
bought that from Wrather

31:50.408 --> 31:51.951
other than the Disney Company,

31:52.035 --> 31:55.246
they could have built Disneyland hotels
all over the United States

31:55.330 --> 31:56.414
<i>or all over the world.</i>

31:56.497 --> 31:59.792
NARRATOR: <i>As the custodian
of the Disney name, Eisner said...</i>

31:59.876 --> 32:00.919
DONALD: <i>"It's got our name on it,</i>

32:01.002 --> 32:03.212
so whatever happens
to that hotel reflects on us.

32:03.296 --> 32:04.672
It reflects on Disney.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.592
So we, now, have to get that hotel."

32:08.176 --> 32:09.844
NARRATOR: <i>But as fate would have it,</i>

32:09.928 --> 32:13.640
<i>an old friendship allowed Disney
to protect their good name.</i>

32:13.723 --> 32:16.851
Bonita Granville got cancer in 1987,

32:17.226 --> 32:20.772
um, and her last wish was that Disney

32:20.855 --> 32:23.691
<i>would put their magic touches
on that hotel.</i>

32:23.775 --> 32:25.318
NARRATOR: <i>And with her last wish,</i>

32:25.401 --> 32:28.863
<i>the magic of a bygone era
passed into history.</i>

32:29.572 --> 32:33.242
<i>And Chris Wrather sold
the Disneyland Hotel to Disney.</i>

32:33.326 --> 32:35.036
Good boy, sweetheart. Bless you.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.455
So, we were able to take over the control

32:37.664 --> 32:41.584
of that 40 acres of land
with those hotels on it.

32:41.668 --> 32:45.338
NARRATOR: <i>Leaving behind a roadmap
for all Disney hotels to come,</i>

32:45.421 --> 32:49.050
<i>including changes
to the Disneyland Hotel itself,</i>

32:49.133 --> 32:52.136
<i>which has continued to change and evolve.</i>

32:52.929 --> 32:56.224
<i>But let's be honest,
without Walt and Jack,</i>

32:56.307 --> 32:59.310
<i>who knows what magic
would fill the world in their place?</i>

32:59.394 --> 33:01.813
I think they were both
very, very creative people.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.983
Walt Disney was creative in a...
in a whole...

33:05.358 --> 33:07.485
in a whole magnificently different way.

33:07.568 --> 33:09.445
NARRATOR: <i>And the generations
of Imagineers</i>

33:09.529 --> 33:11.572
<i>that came after followed that lead</i>

33:11.656 --> 33:15.535
<i>and took Disney hotels
to a whole new level of immersion,</i>

33:15.618 --> 33:18.162
<i>like Disney's Hawaiian resort Aulani,</i>

33:18.496 --> 33:21.916
<i>a Disney Resort and Spa
in Ko Olina, Hawaii.</i>

33:22.000 --> 33:24.127
What makes Aulani very different

33:24.210 --> 33:27.964
is that it's not necessarily
about telling a Disney story.

33:28.047 --> 33:30.508
The main story there
is the Hawaiian culture.

33:30.591 --> 33:32.301
Typically, we're the authors.

33:32.385 --> 33:36.681
We made this stuff up, right?
We know everything 'cause we made it up.

33:37.181 --> 33:40.184
But in this case,
we're learning it every day.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.103
And that's really exciting!

33:42.186 --> 33:45.314
NARRATOR: <i>But completing Aulani
was not completely smooth sailing.</i>

33:45.398 --> 33:48.317
You know, building
these big things is really scary

33:48.401 --> 33:51.946
<i>because they're really big
and they're really complicated.</i>

33:52.030 --> 33:53.573
JOE: <i>You're working really, really hard</i>

33:53.656 --> 33:57.243
on lots of things simultaneously
to get it all done.

33:57.326 --> 33:58.870
NARRATOR: <i>And it's not just the big stuff.</i>

33:58.953 --> 34:01.914
<i>A lot of care was put
into the smallest details as well.</i>

34:01.998 --> 34:06.461
If you walk around Aulani, for instance,
all the, uh, bracing, all the brackets,

34:06.544 --> 34:09.338
the architectural features,
they represent handmade,

34:09.422 --> 34:11.674
<i>traditional building
from the Hawaiian era.</i>

34:11.758 --> 34:13.593
I think that's pretty cool.

34:13.676 --> 34:14.969
NARRATOR: <i>It is pretty cool, Joe!</i>

34:15.053 --> 34:17.889
<i>And all in all,
it's those cool little details</i>

34:17.972 --> 34:21.059
<i>that contribute to the overall vision
for Aulani.</i>

34:21.142 --> 34:23.770
This is a place
that we want you to stay at

34:23.853 --> 34:26.314
and be fully immersed in a story
that we are trying to tell you.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.192
NARRATOR:
<i>A story not of Mickey and Minnie,</i>

34:29.275 --> 34:30.860
<i>even though, you know, they're there,</i>

34:30.943 --> 34:32.987
<i>but the story of Aulani.</i>

34:33.071 --> 34:35.531
You can tell the story
in a very subtle way.

34:35.615 --> 34:37.825
But if you look for it, it's there.
It's magical.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.079
NARRATOR: <i>Aulani may be one
of the newer additions to the resorts,</i>

34:41.162 --> 34:43.456
<i>but its roots go back to the beginning,</i>

34:43.539 --> 34:46.584
<i>with the Disneyland Hotel
and Walt Disney World.</i>

34:46.667 --> 34:49.378
And so, from a distance,
you see an A-frame.

34:49.462 --> 34:50.713
JEANETTE:
<i>It's an A-frame that is reminiscent</i>

34:50.797 --> 34:51.839
<i>of what we did with the Contemporary.</i>

34:51.923 --> 34:56.344
<i>But this idea of having
a central building, or a lobby,</i>

34:56.427 --> 34:59.847
<i>or an icon that draws you in and says,
"This is what the story is about"?</i>

35:00.306 --> 35:02.558
That is what we took from places
like the Contemporary,

35:02.642 --> 35:04.185
what we took from the Polynesian as well.

35:04.268 --> 35:08.397
NARRATOR: <i>Today, Disney continues
to expand its themed resort hotels,</i>

35:08.481 --> 35:12.276
<i>offering guests a variety
of different worlds to explore.</i>

35:12.693 --> 35:14.779
<i>And soon, off world.</i>

35:14.862 --> 35:16.697
ANN: <i>Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser</i>

35:16.781 --> 35:20.201
is a completely new type
of vacation experience.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.245
NARRATOR: <i>But that's another story.</i>

35:22.328 --> 35:26.040
I look at any of our Disney hotels
as living, breathing machines.

35:26.541 --> 35:27.583
They never go to sleep.

35:27.667 --> 35:30.128
BO: <i>They're open 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.</i>

35:30.211 --> 35:32.630
<i>They always have to look great.
And, most importantly,</i>

35:32.713 --> 35:35.174
they always have to remind you
that you're in someplace special.

35:36.759 --> 35:39.679
We can build buildings.
We can create spaces for guests to walk.

35:39.762 --> 35:42.765
But what we're really doing
is we're creating these environments

35:42.849 --> 35:48.646
that free you up to feel, to connect,
to feel the richness of the storytelling

35:48.729 --> 35:51.065
and the detail in a way
that you don't get anywhere else.

35:51.357 --> 35:53.568
And that is magic.

35:53.651 --> 35:57.905
NARRATOR: <i>And now, thanks to Jack Wrather
and mostly this guy...</i>

35:57.989 --> 35:59.824
-KID: Good night, Mr. Disney.
-Good night, kids.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.910
NARRATOR:
<i>After your long day at Disneyland...</i>

36:02.994 --> 36:03.995
Good night.

36:04.078 --> 36:06.205
<i>...you can stay in that magic, too.</i>

36:08.624 --> 36:10.626
(lively music)
