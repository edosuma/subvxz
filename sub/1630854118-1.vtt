WEBVTT

00:17.183 --> 00:19.019
- This is my last trick.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.989
Watch carefully, when I'm done,
I'll tell you how it works.

00:40.273 --> 00:41.573
- Right now around the world,

00:41.574 --> 00:44.744
there are about 80
million people, fucking.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.281
Some of them are even
getting pregnant.

00:49.282 --> 00:52.185
Which is what I'm trying
to do myself, tonight.

00:58.024 --> 01:00.659
You know, when you undress
a woman with your eyes,

01:00.660 --> 01:01.995
that's just half the story.

01:03.463 --> 01:04.663
'Cause once the
woman says "Yes,"

01:04.664 --> 01:07.466
and we do more often
than you think,

01:07.467 --> 01:10.503
it's the woman who sooner
or later sees a man naked.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.605
I'll put it on your tab.

01:14.074 --> 01:17.076
And I don't mean buck naked, I
mean what's beneath the skin,

01:17.077 --> 01:18.878
behind your eyes,
inside your heart.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.049
It's a whole lot more
complicated than just plain fucking.

01:26.152 --> 01:30.189
Funny thing is, it's not the
sex you come here for, is it?

01:30.190 --> 01:31.590
It's something else.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.259
- One!

02:11.331 --> 02:13.065
- I know you.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.000
You're that comedian.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.167
- Ah, yeah.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.202
- You're funny.
You're really funny.

02:17.203 --> 02:19.104
Uh, thanks.

02:19.105 --> 02:19.939
- Can you?

02:20.840 --> 02:21.674
Could you?

02:23.443 --> 02:24.344
Never mind.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.611
- Oh, what?

02:25.612 --> 02:27.746
- Could you do that
thing thing you do?

02:27.747 --> 02:28.881
- Oh.

02:28.882 --> 02:29.949
I'd rather not.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.018
- Okay.

02:33.019 --> 02:36.188
- Unless, you know, you
wanna give me a little...

02:36.189 --> 02:37.489
- What?

02:37.490 --> 02:38.892
- A little discount.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.994
- You want me to
give you a discount

02:41.995 --> 02:44.196
just because you do
some stupid joke?

02:44.197 --> 02:45.531
Well, you're the one who wanted.

02:45.532 --> 02:48.300
- Oh come, you won't just do it?

02:48.301 --> 02:49.202
- Oh God.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.406
Okay.

02:54.407 --> 02:58.978
Okay.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.081
- Hubba Bubba Dubba!

03:05.585 --> 03:09.322
- All the dumb things men do
to get laid, like talking.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.657
You wanna be sexy?

03:11.658 --> 03:13.125
Just shut up.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.093
Otherwise you run the risk
of telling us too much

03:14.094 --> 03:17.129
about your mother, or your wife.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.564
Don't get me wrong,

03:18.565 --> 03:20.632
gettin' laid is what
makes the world go 'round.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.802
It's an absolute
necessity for my business.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.372
Hey, who's wearing
too much aftershave?

03:27.540 --> 03:29.041
- What did you order?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.275
You must have some wine.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.544
This is my favorite,
1987 Chateau Margaux.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.613
I'll buy you a case,
send it to your house!

03:34.614 --> 03:39.285
Oh,

03:47.527 --> 03:49.027
I see the people walking by.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.866
- I got a stand-up
routine for you.

03:54.867 --> 03:55.835
- Really?

03:55.836 --> 03:57.237
- You betcha, you wanna hear it?

03:59.572 --> 04:01.940
- I kinda rather
you just show me.

04:01.941 --> 04:02.742
- Okay.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.276
You got the money?

04:04.277 --> 04:06.245
- Well, I thought you were
gon' give me a discount?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.479
- For what?

04:07.480 --> 04:09.414
- You know, the
hubba hubba stuff.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.782
- Oh, we didn't discuss that.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.284
- Oh yeah we did,

04:12.285 --> 04:15.821
Remember I specifically asked
if you'd give me a discount.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.156
- Did I agree to the terms?

04:18.258 --> 04:19.491
- Terms?

04:19.492 --> 04:20.892
- Did I agree, either
verbally or on paper

04:20.893 --> 04:23.228
to provide you with a discount?

04:23.229 --> 04:26.331
Okay, how much?

04:26.332 --> 04:27.166
- 500.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.102
- I can't believe you're
gon' charge me that much.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.570
- How much do you think
these things usually cost?

04:31.571 --> 04:35.875
- Look, what if I, say, gave
you, my, say, autograph?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.079
- How much is that worth?

04:41.080 --> 04:43.782
- I dunno, 400 or so.

04:43.783 --> 04:44.617
- Dollars?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.917
- Mm-hmm.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.887
- Your autograph isn't
not worth that much.

04:51.090 --> 04:54.092
You don't think I'm
worth 500 measly dollars?

04:54.093 --> 04:55.227
- I'm sure you are-
- Just because you're

04:55.228 --> 04:56.728
some big-shot
celebrity, been on TV,

04:56.729 --> 04:57.664
makes you any better
than me, okay?

04:57.665 --> 04:58.930
Well. No one said-

04:58.931 --> 05:00.198
- I should charge you
extra, for the insult.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.334
- Look, I'm going home.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.203
- Fine.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.440
Your loss, buddy.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.110
- Somehow I'll survive.

05:12.278 --> 05:15.013
- You know, you're a
very disturbed person.

05:15.014 --> 05:16.281
- What?

05:16.282 --> 05:18.116
- That's why you come
to see people like me.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.085
- Oh, you my therapist now?

05:20.086 --> 05:21.520
- Otherwise, you'd
have a girlfriend.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.557
- Well, for your information,
I do have a girlfriend.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.593
- And you're cheating on her?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.829
With me?

05:30.830 --> 05:32.030
Oh my God!

05:32.031 --> 05:33.432
- You really are
nuts, you know that?

05:33.433 --> 05:34.734
- What did you say?

05:35.702 --> 05:37.303
- You are. You are really crazy.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.276
- I'm not crazy.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.111
- You get out of the way.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.045
- You take that back.

05:46.045 --> 05:46.813
- You get away from that door!

05:46.814 --> 05:48.380
- No.

05:48.381 --> 05:52.584
The women.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.020
Mostly the women.

05:55.254 --> 05:56.355
Wooh!

05:58.257 --> 06:02.194
And in the morning, their hair
still wet from the shower,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.830
the women, so beautiful
and naked in their shower

06:04.831 --> 06:06.465
I live through
you, you know that.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.577
Oww!

06:22.482 --> 06:23.782
- Hubba Bubba!

06:23.783 --> 06:24.951
Oh my God.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.286
- Another fucking birthday.

06:28.287 --> 06:29.621
Feel the magic.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.785
You guys all have
one thing in common.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.320
You're so damn funny to watch.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.688
Though I gotta say,

07:03.689 --> 07:05.357
turn 'em upside down,
they all look the same.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.892
It's such a guy thing.

07:13.833 --> 07:14.867
- I teach yoga.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.004
Breath of life.

07:22.241 --> 07:23.842
- Women don't look
at men that way.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.577
We could if we wanted to.

07:25.578 --> 07:28.815
Hey, Brit, I need you to
spell me at nine, Okay?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.285
- Hot date?

07:34.020 --> 07:35.620
- None of your damn business.

07:35.621 --> 07:39.758
- You must have a beautiful
name or I will surely die.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.359
- Florida.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.361
- Florida!

07:43.362 --> 07:45.630
But why not Nebraska
or Carolina?

07:45.631 --> 07:46.466
Or Marina Del Rey

07:46.467 --> 07:48.233
I call you Marina!

07:48.234 --> 07:49.401
- Sure. Why Not.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.269
- Marina, this is more
sexy name for you.

07:51.270 --> 07:54.773
The water, the boats slipping
in and out of the docks,

07:54.774 --> 07:56.842
this is so much more sexy.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.977
Please, you will have some wine?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.545
- Just a diet coke, no ice.

08:00.546 --> 08:03.548
- No, you must taste this
wine, 1987 Chateau Margaux.

08:03.549 --> 08:04.650
- Diet coke, no ice. Thanks.

08:07.353 --> 08:08.753
So, what's your name?

08:08.754 --> 08:10.690
- Marcello. Mastroianni.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.459
- You don't happen to
have any mouthwash?

08:14.894 --> 08:16.161
Never mind.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.063
Never mind.

08:19.799 --> 08:22.467
Look, I know you've probably
heard this before, I'm married.

08:22.468 --> 08:23.935
I'm married.

08:23.936 --> 08:24.770
But.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.979
I'm just not a very good liar.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.280
She always knows when
I've snuck a Snickers

08:35.281 --> 08:37.082
out of the fridge,
or when I smoke.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.650
Boy oh boy, she
hate when I smoke.

08:38.651 --> 08:40.553
So she'd smell me. And you.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.021
Course, she's been
really busy lately.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.257
And I'm still young.

08:45.925 --> 08:50.428
You know in Europe, men
have wives and mistresses.

08:50.429 --> 08:51.663
(Sitar Music

08:51.664 --> 08:52.098
- I can do this for
one hour, 10 minutes.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.166
The Yogi Kutamanda,

08:55.167 --> 08:57.537
could remain in this
position for 48 hours.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.308
One woman died of
pleasure afterward.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.543
Died!

09:04.544 --> 09:08.047
So many orgasms, oh,
she could not breathe.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.650
- I mean, in Europe,
they sit around a café.

09:11.651 --> 09:14.119
You can't exactly do that here.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.755
I mean there's Seattle's
Best and Starbucks.

09:16.756 --> 09:21.761
I kinda like, you know, prefer
the chai latte at Starbucks.

09:23.296 --> 09:26.365
Sprinkles, and the
nutmeg they put on it.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.134
Did you know that
seven-year itch

09:29.135 --> 09:31.002
is a biologically-based
phenomenon?

09:31.003 --> 09:32.938
That deer and bears
and, you know, animals,

09:32.939 --> 09:35.273
they take seven years to
have and wean their young.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.741
And then they move on and
start a whole other family!

09:36.742 --> 09:38.511
They're like serial monogamists!

09:41.480 --> 09:43.114
So maybe I'm just in the
seven-year-itch part, huh!

09:43.115 --> 09:43.983
- Do it to me!

09:51.357 --> 09:53.124
- Oh, yeah, baby, do it to me.

09:53.960 --> 09:54.794
Do it to me.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.194
Oh yeah baby!

09:56.195 --> 09:59.999
- Wait! Boston Bruins!
Boston Bruins! Boston Bruins!

10:06.739 --> 10:09.809
- I've only been
married, four years.

10:11.944 --> 10:15.880
But we dated for
four, no, five years.

10:15.881 --> 10:18.117
So I'm either too
early or too late.

10:19.885 --> 10:20.886
If you count dating.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.321
My therapist tells
me I need to have

10:23.322 --> 10:25.290
a fuller experience
of my masculinity.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.758
I guess he's just
trying to say that

10:26.759 --> 10:28.994
as men, we all make mistakes
and I should, you know,

10:28.995 --> 10:29.862
take my turn.

10:32.331 --> 10:33.932
- So what can I do for you?

10:33.933 --> 10:35.500
- What are my choices?

10:35.501 --> 10:36.968
- You know the choices.

10:36.969 --> 10:40.538
- Ah, tell them to me.
Is so much more sexy.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.576
Ah, you women, on your knees
you have all the power.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.712
Should you ever stand,
we men are finished.

10:47.713 --> 10:51.049
- What you're paying, I can
go around the world with you.

10:51.050 --> 10:54.486
- Can you go around
the world in 450 days?

10:54.487 --> 10:56.989
- I can go anywhere
you want, baby. 750.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.892
- But if I already
know it's a mistake,

11:00.893 --> 11:03.795
then it's not really
a mistake, is it?

11:03.796 --> 11:05.997
Although there could be
ramifications I am not aware of.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.132
Which makes it a mistake.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.401
So, this is a mistake,
coming to you.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.635
Not that you're a mistake.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.304
Just, you know,
coming to see you.

11:14.807 --> 11:18.644
- Boston Bruins! Boston
Bruins! Boston Bruins!

11:24.550 --> 11:26.484
Whenever my Pranayama
breath begins to fail,

11:26.485 --> 11:28.988
I think of hockey, the
Boston Bruins specifically.

11:30.423 --> 11:31.824
- You know, maybe we should
get to know each other first.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.392
We could get some coffee.

11:34.393 --> 11:35.593
Maybe even take in
a play at night.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.696
At night, I forgot,
your prime time.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.965
So, maybe, you know, there's
this Italian film festival,

11:40.966 --> 11:41.934
Rosalini and De Sica.

11:41.934 --> 11:42.868
- Boston Bruins! Boston Bruins!

11:42.869 --> 11:45.370
Boston Bruins! Boston Bruins!

11:45.371 --> 11:47.206
No, coffee,
coffee sounds better.

11:48.340 --> 11:49.241
Yeah, so we'll get some coffee

11:49.242 --> 11:50.476
and then we'll, whoa!

11:54.346 --> 11:55.547
- Whooo!

11:55.548 --> 11:56.881
I'm taking these drugs,

11:56.882 --> 11:58.783
that make me feel like shit.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.819
Clomid, Myradol.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.421
And on the back here, it
says, "Symptoms may include

12:03.422 --> 12:07.058
severe headaches, mood
swings, nausea, hot flashes."

12:07.059 --> 12:09.461
I guess it makes being
pregnant downright pleasurable

12:09.462 --> 12:10.396
in comparison.

12:11.864 --> 12:15.333
- How much money do you make
in one year? 200,000? More?

12:15.334 --> 12:16.367
- Yeah. Good luck.

12:16.368 --> 12:17.602
- You make less?

12:17.603 --> 12:18.837
- Maybe.

12:18.838 --> 12:22.006
- What if I could pay
you one million dollars?

12:22.007 --> 12:23.575
- What, I gotta kill somebody?

12:23.576 --> 12:27.412
- Oh my darling, so
much not killing.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.582
- Yeah. This is getting
weird. I'm gotta go.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.785
- Ah! A tough negotiator!
You must be a Capricorn!

12:33.786 --> 12:34.620
- No.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.457
So, are we on the
same boat or not?

12:39.859 --> 12:42.494
Si, Madonna, you American
women, nothing fools you, yes?

12:42.495 --> 12:43.329
- Yes.

12:45.564 --> 12:46.798
Taurus.

12:46.799 --> 12:47.666
- Ah, I knew it!

12:47.667 --> 12:49.134
The bull.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.504
Stubborn. But so sexy.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.708
Aowwww!

12:56.709 --> 13:00.145
You are fiery. I
love this in a woman.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.380
I will pay you 2000.

13:02.381 --> 13:03.615
- I only want 750.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.216
- No. That is for
the other thing.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.584
I pay you to argue with me.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.086
- 750.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.988
- No! You must take the 2000.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.457
- Yeah, okay you are whacked.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.994
- This is perfetto!

13:15.995 --> 13:17.195
- Oh!

13:17.196 --> 13:19.564
Is this like the Kama
Sutra Indian shit?

13:19.565 --> 13:23.068
- India? No way, sister,
I am from Pakistan.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.305
- Oh, you guys from Pakistan
really know what you're doing.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.908
Oh yeah, don't stop.
Don't stop! Don't stop!

13:29.909 --> 13:33.244
- Boston Bruins, Boston Bruins.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.079
- I'm out of here.

13:34.079 --> 13:34.914
- Wait!

13:36.715 --> 13:38.283
Where are you going?

13:38.284 --> 13:39.218
Wait!

13:39.219 --> 13:42.620
What did I do? What did I say?

13:42.621 --> 13:43.855
You Western women,

13:43.856 --> 13:46.658
you fuck like you are
shopping for vegetables!

13:46.659 --> 13:47.493
- Oh, God.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.396
I look like shit.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.066
You know, we check
you guys out too.

13:55.067 --> 13:58.536
Your butts, your
hands, your faces,

13:58.537 --> 13:59.871
we're scoping out
the whole package.

13:59.872 --> 14:02.240
Something from the
prehistoric days.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.175
Searching through
the whole gene pool,

14:04.176 --> 14:05.845
trying to keep
the race evolving.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.580
We may start out
looking for a good fuck,

14:08.581 --> 14:11.784
but sooner or later we end
up looking for a good father.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.153
Maybe that's why we end up
with versions of our own dad,

14:15.154 --> 14:17.389
I don't know.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.726
Hello, is Richard there?

14:22.094 --> 14:24.129
Oh. Who are you, his wife?

14:25.331 --> 14:27.666
His mother?

14:30.002 --> 14:31.769
What do you mean he's out of
town, he can't be out of town,

14:31.770 --> 14:34.740
we had a very, very important
appointment tonight.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.676
Well people don't
just go out of town,

14:38.677 --> 14:40.412
they go someplace I mean.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.382
Cleveland?

14:44.917 --> 14:46.151
Nobody goes to Cleveland.

14:50.823 --> 14:51.657
I'm sorry.

15:16.682 --> 15:21.086
- So, I am blindfolded by
Magic Girl, okay thank you.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.657
Okay! Can I just have the
cards, back. Thank you.

15:25.658 --> 15:29.395
And I need somebody
to, pick a card.

15:30.796 --> 15:32.964
And if you're raising
your hand, I can't see it.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.199
I just assume you're
right there, go ahead,

15:35.200 --> 15:36.302
tell me when to stop.

15:37.469 --> 15:39.170
Before I'm done.

15:40.372 --> 15:41.372
Okay, here we go.
Tell me when to stop.

15:41.373 --> 15:42.308
- Stop.
- Okay, good.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.876
Take the top card, please.

15:45.744 --> 15:49.681
Do not show it to
me or Magic Girl.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.060
- Give me back my card.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.372
- We also do a thriving
out-call business.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.608
My employees don't offer much
in the way of conversation.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.944
They let the clients
do the talking.

16:19.945 --> 16:23.881
- Society invented love to try
to keep the family together.

16:23.882 --> 16:25.083
Yeah, they want you to think

16:25.084 --> 16:26.250
there's got to be some
kind of connection

16:26.251 --> 16:27.986
between sex and the love thing.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.254
But it just ain't true.

16:30.255 --> 16:33.358
No, I give you an example,
I mean I love to play golf.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.226
But I don't wanna have
sex with my golf partner,

16:35.227 --> 16:38.529
you know what I'm sayin'?

16:38.530 --> 16:40.031
Man I'd love to
have sex with you,

16:40.032 --> 16:42.700
but I don't know if I'd
wanna play golf with you.

16:42.701 --> 16:46.070
Yeah, I got this Iowa deal
I've been working on for about,

16:46.071 --> 16:50.108
oh maybe like five months,
something like that, you know.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.577
If I could get that
baby to close, whoo boy!

16:52.578 --> 16:54.212
We're talking champagne,
champagne for everybody.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.381
Yeah, big old payday!

16:56.782 --> 16:58.983
How much you usually
cost, anyway?

16:58.984 --> 17:00.318
I mean, it don't
make any difference.

17:00.319 --> 17:01.552
I mean he's gon' pay you,

17:01.553 --> 17:03.021
and he's gonna pay
you well, you know?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.756
I mean, I consult with
this guy, you know?

17:04.757 --> 17:07.291
I am his consultant, you know?

17:07.292 --> 17:09.428
Yeah, he you gon' like you.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.164
We got ourselves a
little extra time here.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.365
Great big old limousine.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.301
Maybe you feel like
making yourself

17:17.302 --> 17:20.004
a little extra cash
here, you know?

17:20.005 --> 17:22.073
I ain't got a whole lot, I
didn't bring much with me.

17:22.074 --> 17:24.943
But, hell, he's gonna pay
you enough anyway as it is.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.846
The guy's got more
money than God.

17:29.248 --> 17:32.050
It ain't like he's gonna catch
my hand in the cookie jar,

17:32.051 --> 17:33.851
before his.

17:33.852 --> 17:35.287
He's got everything.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.892
How's about a look
at your breasts? Huh?

17:40.893 --> 17:43.828
Yeah? I bet you could do one
of them wet-tee-shirt contests.

17:43.829 --> 17:46.431
Whoo-hoo, yeah, I bet you could.

17:46.432 --> 17:49.567
I went to one of them once
down in Cabo, whoo hoo!

17:49.568 --> 17:53.738
I'm tellin' you wild, I
mean real wild! Yes indeed!

17:53.739 --> 17:56.207
Them "Girls Gone Wild"
totally video things,

17:56.208 --> 17:57.875
you know what I'm sayin'?

17:57.876 --> 17:59.077
I bet it's probably kinda tame

17:59.078 --> 18:00.945
for what you're
used to though, hey.

18:00.946 --> 18:02.447
Yeah!

18:02.448 --> 18:03.915
I mean, an example of that
is, you're kinda short,

18:03.916 --> 18:07.118
what are you, about 5'2",
something like that?

18:07.119 --> 18:07.953
Is that right?

18:09.388 --> 18:11.523
Yeah?

18:14.126 --> 18:16.327
I got an eye for height,
even with you sitting down,

18:16.328 --> 18:17.829
I can check it.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.098
Yeah check it out get it all
the time right there yeah.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.000
I bet you'd be one hell
of a little spinner-fuck.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.203
I bet you would.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.872
I bet I could spin you around.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.576
I bet I could spin you around
and make your head dizzy.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.812
- How come?

18:34.813 --> 18:35.647
How come?

18:37.049 --> 18:40.785
There's the leather furniture
and the pretty white girls

18:40.786 --> 18:42.320
who ain't got no problems.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.889
I cain't pay for none of that.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.693
How come I can't fuck
the pretty white girls.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.596
I gotta fuck some nasty
whore with syphilis

18:51.597 --> 18:54.066
and gonorrhea and aids and shit.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.969
'Cause George Bush he done it.

18:58.437 --> 19:02.473
He put us over there
in Nam. I was there.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.709
I saw everything.
They fucked up.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.044
The brothers is all fucked up.

19:07.045 --> 19:11.116
A whole generation of Black
brothers messed up in the head.

19:12.618 --> 19:14.252
You ain't seen no
George Bush in Nam.

19:14.253 --> 19:15.586
Huh?

19:15.587 --> 19:16.754
Now where the fuck was he?

19:16.755 --> 19:19.123
Hangin' out on daddy's farm,

19:19.124 --> 19:24.129
that's where, MPs patrollin'
the oil fields.

19:26.565 --> 19:30.868
George Bush... and
that Watergate thing.

19:30.869 --> 19:33.271
Now, he the president

19:33.272 --> 19:36.974
and I'm needin' 55 cent
more for a cheeseburger.

19:36.975 --> 19:38.043
That shit is...

19:40.045 --> 19:41.713
How much you gon' cost? Huh?

19:43.182 --> 19:46.684
You are skanky, girl, you are
one skanky mo' fuckin' bitch.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.519
Oh.

19:50.155 --> 19:51.957
I can't say bitch now, can I?

19:54.493 --> 19:58.996
I just wanna know, 'cause I
go up and down these streets,

19:58.997 --> 20:00.464
'cause I'm cold, see?

20:00.465 --> 20:02.867
And there's all
these pretty people,

20:02.868 --> 20:06.137
and I'm thinkin', what happened?

20:06.138 --> 20:08.874
What happened to Love and Peace?

20:09.775 --> 20:12.610
Where'd those hippies go off to?

20:12.611 --> 20:15.780
They all just keel over and die?

20:15.781 --> 20:18.282
Naw! They around.

20:18.283 --> 20:21.819
They just cut their hair,
put on their good suits,

20:21.820 --> 20:25.390
stash their jeans and beads
and sewed up their pockets.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.492
They voted for George Bush.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.228
I mean, where'd
those hippies go?

20:30.229 --> 20:33.264
Not to the Nam,
that's for damn sure.

20:33.265 --> 20:36.300
Only black men and
spics and shit.

20:36.301 --> 20:40.539
One or two crackers in there
too, but mostly it was us.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.275
And now they back.

20:44.276 --> 20:47.445
Them white folk,
they got their BWM's

20:47.446 --> 20:49.381
and their leather furniture

20:51.583 --> 20:54.820
and Yankee baseball
hats and warm coats.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.923
The love generation!

20:59.224 --> 21:00.425
They love they selves.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.664
- Number one, have
you ever paid for sex?

21:06.665 --> 21:09.600
Number two, was it good? Very
good? Dreamlike? Horrendous?

21:09.601 --> 21:11.068
Crash and burn?

21:11.069 --> 21:12.536
Number three, have you ever
worked in a whorehouse?

21:12.537 --> 21:14.171
Number four, have you ever
taken part in group sex?

21:14.172 --> 21:16.374
Number five, have you ever
performed magic tricks in public?

21:16.375 --> 21:18.576
Number six, have you ever
performed in a dog-and-pony act?

21:18.577 --> 21:20.678
Number seven, what does
this remind you of?

21:20.679 --> 21:23.080
Number eight, are you having
sexual fantasies right now?

21:23.081 --> 21:24.582
Number nine,

21:24.583 --> 21:25.683
who is the object of your
sexual fantasies right now?

21:25.684 --> 21:27.184
- Wait, wait, wait.

21:27.185 --> 21:28.120
Look at
the following photographs,

21:28.120 --> 21:29.054
would you pay to have sex with-

21:29.055 --> 21:30.288
- Can I have a moment here?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.455
- Sure. You need
a glass of water?

21:31.456 --> 21:32.757
- Okay.

21:40.932 --> 21:41.733
- Come on in.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.469
Get me a drink, would you?

21:45.470 --> 21:47.004
Vodka martini if you
know how to make it.

21:47.005 --> 21:47.873
I'll be right back.

21:49.174 --> 21:49.941
- Hi, I'm Sal.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.211
- Where are we?

21:54.212 --> 21:57.114
- It's your hotel room.

21:57.115 --> 22:01.052
- No, I mean, what's the plan.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.420
How does all this work?

22:02.421 --> 22:04.922
- It's $300 for the hour.

22:04.923 --> 22:07.291
- Good lord, it's
more than my facial.

22:07.292 --> 22:08.126
- Yeah.

22:09.528 --> 22:11.463
But this'll get those
blood vessels circulating.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.333
It's $300.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.002
- I know but God.

22:25.677 --> 22:26.678
Where are you going?

22:28.480 --> 22:30.182
- I don't negotiate on price.

22:31.383 --> 22:32.818
- Not even if I...

22:36.688 --> 22:38.523
- That's $400.

22:39.691 --> 22:43.527
- Oh. Well, let's just
stick to the basics.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.396
Good.

22:44.396 --> 22:45.197
- You take a check?

22:46.231 --> 22:47.032
- Would you?

22:49.368 --> 22:50.135
- I guess not.

22:51.236 --> 22:52.003
Turn around.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.308
- All right.

23:00.145 --> 23:02.314
- I mean, turn
and face the wall.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.050
- Okay.

23:25.637 --> 23:26.538
Okay. Here.

24:09.314 --> 24:10.648
- Thanks.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.317
- Shall we continue?

24:14.085 --> 24:14.920
- Okay.

24:15.887 --> 24:17.055
Is it hot in here?

24:18.356 --> 24:20.225
- I'm feeling a
little warm myself.

24:35.073 --> 24:36.675
When was your first ejaculation?

24:40.679 --> 24:43.414
- Somehow I expected a
little romance in the deal.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.950
- Romance'll cost you $500.

24:45.951 --> 24:47.251
- The market rate?

24:48.487 --> 24:50.754
- Let me tell you,
you're lucky at 500.

24:50.755 --> 24:51.590
Really?

24:51.591 --> 24:52.656
- Yes.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.192
Senior prom, I took this girl,

24:55.193 --> 24:58.329
set me back $750 by
the time we were done.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.964
And that was high school.

24:59.965 --> 25:00.832
- Did you score?

25:02.234 --> 25:06.738
- Yeah, I scored. I always
score when I want to.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.173
- Well then.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.942
It looks as though you chose
your profession with care.

25:11.943 --> 25:13.978
- Follow your bliss.

25:13.979 --> 25:16.280
Of course, if I
coulda done anything,

25:16.281 --> 25:17.849
I'd've been a real estate agent.

25:19.050 --> 25:21.485
- That's not so hard.
You could do that now.

25:21.486 --> 25:22.953
- What? Between tricks.

25:22.954 --> 25:26.090
- Sure. Kind of a
work-study program.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.259
You could build your
clientele that way.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.760
- I can't add.

25:29.761 --> 25:30.961
- What?

25:30.962 --> 25:32.730
- I can't add to save my life.

25:32.731 --> 25:35.799
But I was really good
at geography, though.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.402
- Going around the
world your specialty?

25:38.403 --> 25:39.237
- No, really.

25:40.605 --> 25:44.109
Magellan... he's my hero.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.778
It took balls to do what he did.

25:47.779 --> 25:50.281
- Yeah, what was that?

25:50.282 --> 25:53.417
- Everyone remembers
Columbus, right?

25:53.418 --> 25:56.620
Magellan, boom! Way more cool.

25:56.621 --> 25:58.356
Magellan circumnavigated
the globe.

25:59.324 --> 26:00.891
- Circumnavigated?

26:00.892 --> 26:04.862
- Yeah, went around the
world, in a boat in 1522.

26:04.863 --> 26:07.998
Now, considering everyone else
thought the world was flat,

26:07.999 --> 26:11.869
Magellan, this guy. He's like
Kobe or Shaq or something.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.103
I mean, think about it,

26:13.104 --> 26:15.739
no refrigerators, no
telephones, no GPS,

26:15.740 --> 26:17.141
no radar, no electri-

26:17.142 --> 26:20.712
- We're not here for a
geography lesson, are we? Sal.

26:22.781 --> 26:24.883
- I think there's some
exploring I can do.

26:39.230 --> 26:40.764
- Ever had sex with a
partner of the same sex?

26:40.765 --> 26:43.067
Ever had a partner of no sex?

26:43.068 --> 26:44.002
- Wait, what does that mean?

26:44.003 --> 26:45.436
- Have you ever had no sex?

26:45.437 --> 26:48.472
- Do you mean, have
I ever been celibate?

26:48.473 --> 26:49.975
- How often do you masturbate?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.113
- Can I just write these down?

26:56.114 --> 26:58.182
- The purpose of this study
is to monitor the physical

26:58.183 --> 26:59.917
and physiological
responses to verbal

26:59.918 --> 27:01.619
as well as visual stimuli.

27:01.620 --> 27:05.056
- But I'm embarrassed.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.024
- I think that's evident.

27:07.025 --> 27:09.827
- Can't we just skip this part?

27:09.828 --> 27:10.662
- Fine.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.501
- Do I still get paid the $200?

27:17.502 --> 27:19.536
- You haven't completed
the questionnaire.

27:19.537 --> 27:20.738
- But I-
- You must complete the

27:20.739 --> 27:22.540
questionnaire or the
data will be incomplete.

27:24.275 --> 27:25.877
- How many more questions?

27:27.846 --> 27:28.647
- Just five.

27:31.182 --> 27:32.549
- Can't you just
write them down?

27:32.550 --> 27:34.551
- No. But I can whisper
them if you'd like.

27:34.552 --> 27:37.955
- But no one's in the room.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.324
- You know, watching.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.126
- People been watching us?

27:42.127 --> 27:43.727
- Of course. It is
a study, after all.

27:43.728 --> 27:45.262
NSF isn't going to fund research

27:45.263 --> 27:47.331
on the effects of socio-sexual
behavioral patterns

27:47.332 --> 27:48.532
without empirical data.

27:48.533 --> 27:50.167
- You mean, scientists
are watching us?

27:50.168 --> 27:52.770
- Oh yeah, and video.
Electroencephalograms.

27:52.771 --> 27:54.939
That's why the wires and all.

27:58.543 --> 28:00.644
- Maybe you'd better whisper.

28:00.645 --> 28:01.446
- Okay.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.819
- Let's just not talk, okay?

28:09.788 --> 28:11.122
- Who's talking?

28:13.625 --> 28:14.459
- Oh, okay.

28:16.127 --> 28:18.129
- Besides it wasn't
me yammering anyway.

28:18.997 --> 28:19.831
- What was that?

28:19.832 --> 28:20.931
- Nothing.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.633
- Did you just say, yammering?

28:22.634 --> 28:24.369
That I'm yammering? Me?

28:25.503 --> 28:27.805
- I just want to make
you happy, honey.

28:27.806 --> 28:30.775
- Don't you honey me,
Sal. You yammerer.

28:32.744 --> 28:34.578
Oh here we go.

28:34.579 --> 28:35.647
- Here we go, what?

28:36.514 --> 28:39.249
- Hey. Let's just drop it, okay?

28:39.250 --> 28:41.719
- Oh, yeah you
wanna just drop it?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.854
Next thing you know you'll
be trying to take it back.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.355
- I do. I take it back.

28:45.356 --> 28:47.357
- Well you can't just take
it back! It's been said!

28:47.358 --> 28:48.559
- All right, you know what?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.094
I don't have to
listen to this crap.

28:50.095 --> 28:52.663
- Oh, excuse me but
who exactly is paying

28:52.664 --> 28:53.831
for this little date?

28:53.832 --> 28:56.100
This big romantic fuck?

28:56.101 --> 28:57.936
- Looks like me in
that special way.

29:04.542 --> 29:05.410
- Get outta here.

29:07.278 --> 29:11.750
Get your clothes and get out.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.953
- There's a little settling up
that we gotta do first, lady.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.354
- We've have nothing to settle.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.823
- It's $350 for the date.

29:19.824 --> 29:21.592
- This is no date.
This is not a date.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.093
- Yes it is.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.928
- And you said 300 before,
when did it become 350?

29:24.929 --> 29:29.867
- It's 300 for the fuck,
an extra 50 because you...

29:29.868 --> 29:31.236
touched my clothes!

29:37.375 --> 29:38.977
- I don't owe you one red cent.

29:44.149 --> 29:47.352
- Usually we just
start breaking things

29:51.055 --> 29:53.157
until you decide to cooperate.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.626
- You break one thing and
I'll see you in court.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.261
- You're gonna sue me?

29:57.262 --> 29:59.396
Why don't you just
give me the extra $50

29:59.397 --> 30:00.998
and I'll get out of your hair.

30:00.999 --> 30:02.533
- No.

30:02.534 --> 30:03.368
- Gimme the money!

30:03.368 --> 30:04.202
- Put that down.

30:04.202 --> 30:05.036
- The money!

30:05.036 --> 30:05.970
- I know karate.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.471
- Gimme the fuckin' money!

30:09.007 --> 30:10.374
- You almost broke this vase!

30:10.375 --> 30:11.309
- Oh, fuck!

30:12.477 --> 30:15.412
Oh, you broke my fucking balls!

30:15.413 --> 30:16.247
- Okay!

30:16.248 --> 30:17.248
Okay, just quiet down.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.683
- Oh, you really do know karate!

30:19.684 --> 30:21.185
Here. Just put this on it.

30:21.186 --> 30:23.854
- Ah Jesus Christ! Is that ice?

30:23.855 --> 30:25.956
- That's what you use to
keep the swelling down.

30:25.957 --> 30:30.027
- Oh.

30:30.028 --> 30:33.597
Oh God.

30:33.598 --> 30:35.032
Oh.

30:35.033 --> 30:40.004
- Oh my God.

30:40.638 --> 30:45.176
Oh my God.

30:46.077 --> 30:49.479
Oh my God.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.248
Oh my God.

30:52.817 --> 30:53.685
Oh my God.

31:21.679 --> 31:23.348
Maybe I could call
you some time?

31:24.182 --> 31:25.415
- What?

31:25.416 --> 31:28.052
- I'd like to ask
you out, a date.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.654
- Dinner? A movie?

31:30.655 --> 31:32.155
- Yeah.

31:32.156 --> 31:32.991
- I'm married.

31:33.858 --> 31:34.692
- Oh.

31:35.693 --> 31:37.160
Oh.

31:37.161 --> 31:40.264
Does your husband know
what you do for a living?

31:40.265 --> 31:42.734
- My husband's the lead
scientist on this project.

31:44.769 --> 31:45.536
- So,

31:48.973 --> 31:53.243
he's gonna watch our interview?

31:53.244 --> 31:56.580
- He's been watching the
entire interview, right there.

31:56.581 --> 31:57.482
He's a scientist.

32:05.456 --> 32:07.525
Thank you for
participating in our study.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.912
- You're good.
You are very good.

32:28.913 --> 32:29.914
Just doing my job.

32:31.516 --> 32:32.350
- I'll say.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.094
- You are one looney
chick, you know that?

32:44.095 --> 32:46.463
- I don't think anyone's
ever called me that before.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.131
- What, looney?

32:48.132 --> 32:50.034
All they gotta do
is look at you lady.

32:52.537 --> 32:54.605
- It's just, I'm the
CEO of my company.

32:56.774 --> 33:00.177
And nobody would dare
call me a looney chick.

33:00.178 --> 33:03.613
- Hey, I gotta go
to the hospital.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.251
My balls are gonna fall off.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.087
- I'll drive you.

33:09.087 --> 33:09.921
- No, no, no-

33:09.922 --> 33:11.421
- I'll drive you.

33:11.422 --> 33:13.457
I hurt you, the least I can
do is get you to the hospital.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.699
- This has been some date, huh.

33:27.572 --> 33:28.973
- Maybe we can reschedule.

33:30.875 --> 33:32.709
- You wanna what?

33:32.710 --> 33:34.811
- You know, maybe when
you're feeling better.

33:34.812 --> 33:36.948
- Like some time next November?

33:39.384 --> 33:41.218
- I used to have this friend.

33:41.219 --> 33:42.487
We'd, you know.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.157
We called ourselves
fuck buddies.

33:47.425 --> 33:49.026
- You mean that he knew you

33:49.027 --> 33:51.062
and he still wanted
to have sex with you?

33:51.996 --> 33:54.031
- I come to town pretty often.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.233
We could be fuck buddies.

33:58.236 --> 34:02.339
- Excuse me, this, is
how I make my living.

34:02.340 --> 34:04.474
- Oh, I'll pay you.

34:04.475 --> 34:05.443
Money is no object.

34:07.812 --> 34:08.646
- What?

34:12.350 --> 34:14.418
That's not what you said
just a few minutes ago.

34:14.419 --> 34:15.286
- Oh, I know.

34:16.454 --> 34:17.288
I was just.

34:23.327 --> 34:24.295
I'm sorry.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.800
- Wow.

34:29.801 --> 34:30.635
- What?

34:34.405 --> 34:36.307
- I'll bet you don't
apologize much.

34:38.776 --> 34:39.610
- No.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.884
- Thank you. The ice helped.

34:50.788 --> 34:55.092
- It's cold. And wet.

34:58.196 --> 34:59.997
- I wanna start
over with the date.

35:11.909 --> 35:14.212
- I thought you said
romance would cost extra.

35:15.646 --> 35:16.481
- Next time.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.554
- Whatever you say, baby.

35:30.761 --> 35:31.596
- You wait.

35:32.530 --> 35:33.763
You just wait.

35:33.764 --> 35:37.135
I close that damn
Iowa deal, yeah.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.537
That Iowa deal, we talkin
champagne, champagne

35:40.538 --> 35:41.372
for everybody.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.639
You just wait.

35:43.474 --> 35:44.308
- Three!

35:49.313 --> 35:50.313
- This is four.

35:50.314 --> 35:51.382
- No, three!

35:53.518 --> 35:54.485
- Four!

35:55.319 --> 35:56.154
- Four!

35:57.655 --> 35:58.489
- Okay.

36:03.895 --> 36:07.165
- So, how much for a blow job?

36:10.501 --> 36:11.335
A fuck?

36:14.305 --> 36:15.173
Around the world?

36:16.240 --> 36:18.376
Ah, that's a little
pricey for me.

36:20.211 --> 36:21.711
I'll just take the blow job.

36:21.712 --> 36:24.347
♪ <i>Moments moving
across the screen</i> ♪

36:24.348 --> 36:26.016
- No, but.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.186
- 'Cause actually, my wife, she
don't go down on me no more.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.555
I mean she used to,
when we was dating,

36:31.556 --> 36:34.858
like a fucking vacuum cleaner.

36:34.859 --> 36:38.863
We'd go to the movies,
make out in the back row.

36:40.498 --> 36:42.333
Oh, yeah, that's good.

36:44.302 --> 36:45.435
I know this
is kinda short notice

36:45.436 --> 36:48.538
but tonight I'm working
on this project.

36:48.539 --> 36:49.839
Suck it hard.

36:49.840 --> 36:54.578
Yeah.

36:54.579 --> 36:57.515
Once she went down
on me at the A&W.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.152
- Cleveland.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.255
I'm comin' and I turn, bam!

37:05.256 --> 37:06.724
There's my root beer float.

37:08.659 --> 37:12.362
Karen lifts her head, and
there's jizz all over her lip.

37:12.363 --> 37:14.431
And the waitress, she don't
miss a beat, she smiles

37:14.432 --> 37:17.468
and says, "You want some
extra napkins with that?"

37:19.237 --> 37:20.370
Oh man.

37:20.371 --> 37:22.505
- Austin was cool, very cool.

37:22.506 --> 37:23.407
Great in bed.

37:24.308 --> 37:25.775
But he was a poet, you know?

37:25.776 --> 37:28.979
- Oh, God save me from
poets. And guitar players.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.947
- Yeah. He was moody.

37:30.948 --> 37:33.416
I never knew what mood
he was gonna end up in.

37:33.417 --> 37:37.053
Oh God, he jumped out of a
window, tried to kill himself,

37:37.054 --> 37:40.023
ended up in a fucking
wheelchair, I forgot.

37:40.024 --> 37:41.224
Loser.

37:41.225 --> 37:44.395
- Oh man, we had
fun in the old days.

37:46.464 --> 37:49.033
- Grace, you're gonna get
old just looking for lines.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.168
Stop.

37:53.971 --> 37:57.540
- It probably starts just
as Uranus and Jupiter

37:57.541 --> 38:01.544
go into Aries, Saturn
passes into Libra,

38:01.545 --> 38:04.681
and the sun and
moon cross Cancer.

38:04.682 --> 38:08.452
- I bought her flowers,
real nice flowers,

38:09.954 --> 38:11.454
you think that makes
any difference?

38:11.455 --> 38:13.123
- If we're lucky enough
to still be standing here

38:13.124 --> 38:18.129
after all this massive
shit-storm currently raining down

38:19.563 --> 38:22.699
on the human population,
well then I say, sit back,

38:22.700 --> 38:24.669
relax and enjoy the movie.

38:26.604 --> 38:28.072
- Have you ever been in love?

38:29.940 --> 38:33.176
They was right about it,

38:33.177 --> 38:35.578
It hurts to be in love.

38:35.579 --> 38:38.249
It hurts so much.
- You want some more?

38:40.117 --> 38:41.519
- I'll kill 'em both.

38:42.987 --> 38:46.523
I'll find out where they are,
which goddamn motel they're in

38:46.524 --> 38:49.359
and put a bullet in their heads!

38:49.360 --> 38:51.428
- I'll suck cock and
take it up the ass

38:51.429 --> 38:52.830
for the right dollar figure.

38:53.864 --> 38:55.266
'Cause none of this matters.

39:00.438 --> 39:02.306
- Hey, hey, come on,
come on, come on.

39:06.944 --> 39:08.678
Let's try again, all right?

39:08.679 --> 39:11.382
- Not when you look at the
night sky with a telescope.

39:13.784 --> 39:14.984
- Here's more.

39:14.985 --> 39:16.120
Is all I got.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.289
- See, I got this telescope.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.258
And last night, I looked
up and I saw a galaxy

39:22.259 --> 39:24.362
50 million light years away.

39:25.663 --> 39:27.664
I'm looking at light
particles that left their home

39:27.665 --> 39:30.567
50 million years ago!

39:30.568 --> 39:33.503
So don't try to tell
me any of this matters.

39:33.504 --> 39:36.974
Except maybe a good
laugh. And a good fuck.

39:49.820 --> 39:54.825
♪ <i>Watching and waiting for
this movie in the dark</i> ♪

39:56.227 --> 39:58.762
- Hey, hey, turn
around. Turn around.

39:58.763 --> 40:03.768
♪ <i>Time slowly, fading while
the actors play their part</i> ♪

40:16.747 --> 40:21.752
♪ <i>Time slowly, fading while
the actors play their part</i> ♪

40:30.761 --> 40:33.864
- Oh no, this is not good.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.133
I've got to go teach a class.

40:37.668 --> 40:38.436
Oh.

40:43.207 --> 40:44.909
Oh, that is not good.

40:47.411 --> 40:48.845
- All right what number's this?

40:48.846 --> 40:50.413
- Six!
- No, it's seven!

40:50.414 --> 40:51.981
- No, six!
- It's seven!

40:51.982 --> 40:53.383
I need to borrow a ring from
someone in the audience.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.719
Any kind of a ring?
Wedding ring? Anything?

40:56.921 --> 40:57.888
Okay, if you don't
give me a ring,

40:57.889 --> 40:59.289
we can't go to intermission.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.458
Well, last trick
before intermission!

41:01.459 --> 41:02.393
Come on now. Great.

41:02.394 --> 41:03.593
Okay! Beautiful! Here's a ring!

41:03.594 --> 41:05.295
Now watch very carefully
as I take the ring,

41:05.296 --> 41:06.930
put it on my finger,
throw it in the air,

41:06.931 --> 41:09.365
like so, it disappears,
reach in my back pocket,

41:09.366 --> 41:12.902
and there, on my
zipped-up key ring case,

41:12.903 --> 41:16.573
is a bunch of keys, and a
ring, is this your ring, Ma'am?

41:16.574 --> 41:17.408
Yeah!

41:17.409 --> 41:18.843
- Okay good, you happy?

41:22.246 --> 41:23.313
It's intermission!

41:23.314 --> 41:24.681
Get some milk and cookies okay?

41:24.682 --> 41:26.617
Get something to drink.

41:37.428 --> 41:38.695
Vodka.

41:38.696 --> 41:40.598
- I thought you weren't
drinking during shows.

41:43.267 --> 41:45.068
- What? I have to, like,
pass a test to get a drink?

41:45.069 --> 41:45.836
- Get out!

41:47.238 --> 41:48.905
- What, I just want a drink.

41:48.906 --> 41:52.108
- Go back to the casino.
They've got six bars there.

41:52.109 --> 41:52.910
- Grace, c'mon.

41:54.078 --> 41:54.845
- Go away.

41:55.946 --> 41:57.414
- I just want one fucking vodka.

42:01.051 --> 42:01.852
- Behave?

42:03.187 --> 42:04.021
- Yeah.

42:08.626 --> 42:11.060
- What are you in
such a good mood for?

42:11.061 --> 42:13.129
- Why are you such a shit?

42:13.130 --> 42:14.564
- I hate my job.

42:14.565 --> 42:15.599
What's your excuse?

42:17.635 --> 42:20.938
- I got dumped by some asshole
for a trip to Cleveland.

42:23.541 --> 42:24.807
- A big date?

42:24.808 --> 42:25.976
- None of you business.

42:26.877 --> 42:28.511
Why don't you just quit?

42:28.512 --> 42:30.947
- Why don't you
get another date?

42:30.948 --> 42:31.782
- Point taken.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.921
Is it the gig, or the city?

42:40.024 --> 42:45.029
- I just wanna move on with
my fucking life somehow,

42:45.663 --> 42:46.030
and I just,

42:47.364 --> 42:48.665
I don't know how.

42:48.666 --> 42:49.633
- Can't go forward.

42:51.302 --> 42:52.102
- Can't go back.

42:55.806 --> 42:57.908
I know.

42:59.443 --> 43:02.646
I had this date
tonight with Richard.

43:04.114 --> 43:07.384
I figured he's alone, I'm
alone, we'd get together.

43:09.053 --> 43:12.355
I even took these
drugs, fertility drugs,

43:12.356 --> 43:13.757
they made me feel like shit.

43:15.192 --> 43:18.695
- What? You want to have
a baby with this guy?

43:18.696 --> 43:19.997
- That's the general idea.

43:22.366 --> 43:25.069
- Wow! Congratulations.

43:26.236 --> 43:29.173
- No, no, it didn't work out.

43:31.809 --> 43:33.110
I had this list, you know?

43:34.378 --> 43:37.348
Brains, looks, the
whole genetic alphabet.

43:38.549 --> 43:39.550
Richard was the guy.

43:40.551 --> 43:42.052
It was supposed to be tonight.

43:44.555 --> 43:45.555
- Oh.

43:45.556 --> 43:46.723
What he just left?

43:46.724 --> 43:48.257
- Yeah.

43:48.258 --> 43:50.026
To Cleveland.

43:50.027 --> 43:52.429
What's in Cleveland,
huh? Nothing.

43:56.033 --> 43:57.234
You ever think about kids?

43:58.669 --> 44:01.070
- Think about them? I
work with them every day.

44:01.071 --> 44:03.741
- No, I mean about having, kids.

44:08.545 --> 44:12.282
- No. They're too
self-centered and spoiled.

44:13.717 --> 44:16.452
And there's only room for
one of those in my life.

44:16.453 --> 44:18.555
- You could learn, to
be less self-centered.

44:20.290 --> 44:21.125
- Sorry.

44:23.927 --> 44:26.497
I guess I've just done too
many shows or something.

44:28.766 --> 44:29.932
Besides, I don't
wanna bring a kid

44:29.933 --> 44:31.602
into a world this fucked up.

44:32.636 --> 44:33.470
- I know.

44:35.305 --> 44:39.375
Seemed to me to be the
greatest act of faith.

44:39.376 --> 44:44.114
You know, to try. Not
to give up.

44:50.054 --> 44:51.587
- Right now it's
just a full-time job

44:51.588 --> 44:53.323
trying to figure
out my own life.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.295
- You gon' go finish
your show now?

45:00.198 --> 45:01.231
- Yeah, I guess.

45:03.967 --> 45:07.204
Thank you for the, drink.

45:13.711 --> 45:14.545
Hey, Grace.

45:21.151 --> 45:23.153
I used to love this one.

45:24.354 --> 45:26.356
First time I saw it, I thought,

45:28.258 --> 45:30.194
"That's why I got into magic."

45:37.034 --> 45:39.470
Well, it used to cheer me up.

45:41.672 --> 45:42.939
- Thank you for trying.

45:44.208 --> 45:45.042
- Hey,

45:46.877 --> 45:47.778
come back later.

45:48.645 --> 45:49.646
If you feel like it.

45:59.556 --> 46:01.125
- So, what's gonna happen?

46:02.626 --> 46:05.996
Well, some say the
sky will open up

46:07.264 --> 46:09.032
and rain fire down
upon our heads

46:10.000 --> 46:11.368
the Lord will appear

46:13.437 --> 46:15.472
and the blessed will
be taken into Heaven

46:16.940 --> 46:18.175
and the damned into hell.

46:20.410 --> 46:21.545
In the Big FJ.

46:23.247 --> 46:24.081
Final Judgment.

46:27.451 --> 46:28.619
- Would you like a drink?

46:30.654 --> 46:33.957
Of vodka of course.

46:35.659 --> 46:37.627
I should have died years ago

46:37.628 --> 46:39.229
from all the vodka that I drink.

46:42.866 --> 46:45.368
Do you understand
a word I'm saying?

46:47.638 --> 46:49.205
Of course not.

46:49.206 --> 46:50.374
How utterly delightful.

46:51.208 --> 46:52.042
- Happy.

46:53.243 --> 46:57.113
So glad to see you. Did
you get to my last gig?

46:57.114 --> 46:59.216
I left a message for
you with the doorman.

47:00.717 --> 47:03.220
It's okay, it was a
late night anyway.

47:04.087 --> 47:05.756
The piano was out of tune.

47:08.125 --> 47:12.629
Oh no, they can't...

47:14.932 --> 47:17.967
I start playing tonight,
and just like that,

47:17.968 --> 47:19.903
just like that, I stop.

47:21.505 --> 47:24.508
'Cause I forgot, the lyrics.

47:26.009 --> 47:27.410
I can't play the tune

47:27.411 --> 47:29.779
if I don't remember the lyrics.

47:29.780 --> 47:30.881
So I stopped.

47:32.816 --> 47:36.720
My wife, that's her favorite
song, she loved that song.

47:38.055 --> 47:39.656
Oh no, they...

47:44.761 --> 47:46.796
Arigato.

47:46.797 --> 47:51.335
You know, we could
just talk awhile.

47:55.873 --> 47:56.640
- Yes.

47:58.041 --> 48:00.477
You look like a
bear, a dancing bear.

48:02.312 --> 48:05.448
You might rethink your
particular fashion statement.

48:05.449 --> 48:06.682
God knows I'm not judging you,

48:06.683 --> 48:08.417
it's just I believe the
clothes make the man.

48:08.418 --> 48:10.519
You could use some refinement

48:10.520 --> 48:11.787
in some of your
choices here, you know.

48:11.788 --> 48:13.590
I know that we just met.

48:16.059 --> 48:17.294
Do you read, sir?

48:18.362 --> 48:19.930
Read, as in books?

48:21.598 --> 48:23.666
Yes, I do seem to have
quite a few of them.

48:23.667 --> 48:27.070
I bring them along as
companions on my journey.

48:28.338 --> 48:29.538
I've read all of
these, so of course,

48:29.539 --> 48:31.675
the question would
be, what next?

48:33.510 --> 48:36.979
Reading can be something of
a savior when one's alone.

48:38.215 --> 48:41.985
Well, let me refresh your glass.

48:43.253 --> 48:46.056
You're not much a
drinker, are you friend?

48:48.525 --> 48:50.793
- This is some
window you got here.

48:50.794 --> 48:52.562
Hey, where are you
from? What city?

48:53.764 --> 48:56.432
Let me guess, not New York.

48:56.433 --> 48:57.668
You got too sweet a face.

48:58.568 --> 49:02.538
I just heard a bit of an accent.

49:02.539 --> 49:06.776
Charming though. I just thought,
maybe Chicago or something.

49:06.777 --> 49:07.744
- Chicago.

49:07.745 --> 49:09.845
- And the blond hair.

49:09.846 --> 49:13.082
Blond hair.

49:13.083 --> 49:14.918
- It look real nice on you.

49:16.053 --> 49:19.156
Your hair dresser
done a real nice job.

49:20.290 --> 49:21.558
I like it blond better.

49:23.226 --> 49:25.729
My wife has dark hair.

49:27.030 --> 49:30.366
Well, now with the
treatments she's got a wig,

49:30.367 --> 49:35.172
but she's real pretty, even
with most of her hair gone.

49:41.411 --> 49:46.416
She was always worried that I
would go to a younger woman.

49:49.252 --> 49:52.022
I never did. Ever.

49:57.627 --> 49:59.963
Look at that building there.

50:00.864 --> 50:02.566
That's real old brick.

50:04.034 --> 50:06.136
You don't see that much anymore.

50:08.005 --> 50:11.141
Looks kinda like a castle.

50:14.244 --> 50:15.779
That's a coincidence, isn't it?

50:16.680 --> 50:17.948
Do you know what that is?

50:19.182 --> 50:21.250
That's the hospital, isn't it?

50:21.251 --> 50:25.221
It is. I should've known.

50:25.222 --> 50:29.326
We're on this side of
the, I didn't realize.

50:30.293 --> 50:31.128
No.

50:45.409 --> 50:46.710
I don't wanna do anything.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.815
I don't even know
why I come up here.

50:55.685 --> 51:00.123
You can keep the
money. Here's a tip.

51:17.874 --> 51:21.745
She was a real
funny kid, my girl.

51:24.414 --> 51:27.183
She would always
laugh at my bad jokes,

51:27.184 --> 51:29.820
even after 20 times
me telling 'em.

51:31.388 --> 51:36.092
Why, just last Tuesday, just
Tuesday, just three days ago,

51:36.093 --> 51:38.394
I got her to laugh.

51:38.395 --> 51:43.400
She actually laughed
which was hard

51:44.434 --> 51:46.636
'cause she was hurting so bad.

52:04.855 --> 52:05.956
I have to go.

52:10.060 --> 52:11.495
I have to go.

52:15.799 --> 52:18.001
You take care.

52:19.903 --> 52:22.004
And be careful, 'cause
it's dangerous out there.

52:22.005 --> 52:23.806
And I'll bet there's
people out there,

52:23.807 --> 52:27.443
there's someone out
there, worrying about you,

52:27.444 --> 52:30.847
thinking about you,
at this very moment.

52:36.786 --> 52:39.523
People dying every day.

52:49.633 --> 52:51.101
You take care.

52:52.669 --> 52:54.538
- But I think God's
smarter than that.

52:57.107 --> 52:58.775
I think He's gonna
sneak up on us.

53:00.577 --> 53:01.945
One day, He'll just show up.

53:03.246 --> 53:05.447
He'll have some
cleaning up to do.

53:05.448 --> 53:08.751
The air, the water,
certain politicians.

53:08.752 --> 53:10.853
But there'll be a time of peace.

53:10.854 --> 53:14.124
Like we can take the race
out of the human race.

53:15.859 --> 53:17.627
Well, I gotta get
back to studying.

53:20.130 --> 53:21.564
Unless you've got some
more disposable income

53:21.565 --> 53:22.899
you wanna dispose on me.

53:25.702 --> 53:30.373
See, this integral calculus
needs time to sink in.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.542
I can handle the
one-variable stuff,

53:33.543 --> 53:38.548
but the two-variable stuff
is one mind-bending fuck.

53:41.985 --> 53:45.555
Hey, you got a handle
on integral calculus?

53:53.163 --> 53:56.865
- Oh yes my, you do stay
in shape, don't you?

53:56.866 --> 54:00.936
There must be something to this
gym-health-club craze, huh?

54:00.937 --> 54:02.705
I find it a bit of a circus

54:02.706 --> 54:04.273
with all the women
prouncing around

54:04.274 --> 54:07.042
with their silly little outfits.

54:07.043 --> 54:10.079
I don't hate women, I just
find them superficial.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.780
They lack substance.

54:11.781 --> 54:15.351
Always wondered, what is
one to talk with them about?

54:15.352 --> 54:17.186
My mother was a wonderful
conversationalist

54:17.187 --> 54:20.189
but even she could be limited

54:20.190 --> 54:21.991
in the breadth of her subjects.

54:21.992 --> 54:24.194
I just will never understand.

54:25.729 --> 54:28.063
Never will understand.

54:28.064 --> 54:28.865
Yes.

54:33.136 --> 54:34.570
Would you mind?

54:34.571 --> 54:35.405
Yes.

54:37.040 --> 54:38.608
Do you ever get lonely, sir?

54:39.409 --> 54:40.976
Lonely?

54:40.977 --> 54:44.681
Do you ever feel, alone?

54:49.419 --> 54:50.253
Oh, never mind.

54:55.258 --> 54:56.926
Beautiful, quite,
quite beautiful.

54:58.461 --> 55:03.333
Yes, so bovine, so diamond hard.

55:04.768 --> 55:07.971
Youth always is, somehow,
so oblivious to it all.

55:09.072 --> 55:13.776
Here you are, like
Michelangelo's "David."

55:13.777 --> 55:18.782
And I do not mean the
dance club, friend. No.

55:19.516 --> 55:20.150
I mean an artist.

55:21.318 --> 55:24.287
An artist who loved
the human form.

55:26.156 --> 55:27.590
It seemed to keep him going.

55:32.762 --> 55:35.031
And you are beautiful.
Yes you are.

55:37.033 --> 55:38.201
And I am drunk.

55:42.772 --> 55:43.773
To Michelangelo.

55:50.914 --> 55:51.748
Come here.

56:02.425 --> 56:04.694
I am going to suck you dry.

56:11.801 --> 56:12.702
- I love this one.

56:13.837 --> 56:15.538
It's just so pure.

56:20.443 --> 56:22.211
But I guess I'm kind of
inconsistent, actually.

56:22.212 --> 56:24.012
'Cause you know
all these tricks,

56:24.013 --> 56:26.115
sooner or later
just become tricks.

56:26.116 --> 56:26.950
Lies.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.653
Show me a trick, it's
like saying, lie to me.

56:32.455 --> 56:33.289
Even this one.

56:35.525 --> 56:38.127
If I keep doing it,
sooner or later,

56:38.128 --> 56:39.462
I'm probably gonna hate it.

56:41.664 --> 56:43.433
But I'm gonna do
it for you anyway.

56:45.235 --> 56:46.970
- You're supposed
to do this one.

56:48.905 --> 56:50.139
- See, if I lie to you,

56:50.140 --> 56:51.908
Magic Girl will tell
you that I'm sane.

56:54.377 --> 56:57.747
But if I tell you the truth,
she'll tell you I've gone nuts.

56:58.848 --> 57:00.350
- You're gonna blow this gig.

57:02.118 --> 57:03.653
- Don't worry. You'll get paid.

57:12.495 --> 57:13.963
The one-handed link.

57:19.202 --> 57:22.439
It always worked so
well in the shower.

57:31.948 --> 57:33.148
- Marina?

57:33.149 --> 57:34.050
I'm sleeping.

57:35.185 --> 57:36.685
- For this I pay you?

57:36.686 --> 57:37.954
- No, for this.

57:39.189 --> 57:41.758
- Ow!
- You pay me.

57:44.127 --> 57:45.829
That was my union
break, Marcello.

57:51.267 --> 57:53.902
- I thought you'd
never make the kiss.

57:53.903 --> 57:55.404
- I woke up romantic.

57:55.405 --> 57:57.706
- I could marry you.

57:57.707 --> 58:01.243
- Make an honest woman of
me? Yeah, no thank you.

58:01.244 --> 58:03.579
- Of course, you are right.

58:03.580 --> 58:05.881
You know why I go to escort
service and not the date?

58:05.882 --> 58:07.616
- 'Cause whores
know how to fuck.

58:07.617 --> 58:09.718
- You are so direct, my darling.

58:09.719 --> 58:12.621
But also, the women I date
want to marry me, for my money.

58:12.622 --> 58:15.123
- Whereas I only wanna
fuck you for your money.

58:15.124 --> 58:17.493
- Yes, my darling. You
are, how I say? Authentic.

58:17.494 --> 58:18.962
This I love about you.

58:20.630 --> 58:23.733
Come, what is your real name?

58:24.634 --> 58:25.734
- I already told you.

58:25.735 --> 58:26.669
- I do not believe you.

58:26.670 --> 58:27.903
- What's your real name?

58:27.904 --> 58:28.771
- I tell you.

58:28.772 --> 58:30.006
- No, you lied.

58:30.874 --> 58:32.341
I saw those Fellini movies,

58:32.342 --> 58:34.544
you are definitely not
Marcello Mastroianni.

58:36.446 --> 58:39.015
Come on, what's your real name?

58:40.450 --> 58:43.186
- Emilio Santangelo Tognoni.

58:46.155 --> 58:46.990
And yours?

58:47.924 --> 58:49.157
- Santa Lucia.

58:49.158 --> 58:51.960
- Come on, I tell you
mine, you tell me yours.

58:51.961 --> 58:54.162
- Marilynn Monroe.

58:54.163 --> 58:56.965
- Okay, I pay you
1,000 to tell me.

58:56.966 --> 58:58.367
- Really, $1,000?

58:58.368 --> 58:59.368
- $100.

58:59.369 --> 59:00.702
- You said $1,000.

59:00.703 --> 59:02.738
- I make mistake. My
English not so good.

59:02.739 --> 59:04.973
- I just forgot my real name.

59:04.974 --> 59:08.644
- Okay, okay! I pay you $1,000,
now you tell me your name.

59:08.645 --> 59:10.078
- Let's see the bucks.

59:10.079 --> 59:10.914
- After. Later.

59:11.981 --> 59:13.448
- Now.

59:13.449 --> 59:16.718
Maybe we get one more...

59:16.719 --> 59:18.053
For same price?

59:18.054 --> 59:18.888
- Maybe.

59:23.293 --> 59:26.495
It's raining and I
can't get wet.

59:26.496 --> 59:27.330
- I'm sorry?

59:28.197 --> 59:29.699
- It's all this sex happening.

59:31.334 --> 59:33.336
- You're looking for a date?

59:35.204 --> 59:36.039
- Maybe.

59:37.740 --> 59:40.409
- Wow. I didn't think...

59:40.410 --> 59:41.611
- You didn't think what?

59:42.812 --> 59:45.148
- You're the boss,
I didn't think...

59:47.083 --> 59:47.917
- Shut up.

59:48.851 --> 59:50.420
Come dance with me.

59:55.491 --> 59:57.626
♪ <i>I'm going crazy over you</i> ♪

59:57.627 --> 59:59.028
I love this song.

1:00:01.164 --> 1:00:03.933
Oh God, why didn't
I get married?

1:00:05.969 --> 1:00:08.404
Not like I didn't have
enough guys asking me.

1:00:12.976 --> 1:00:17.579
Hey, this is the happiest
place on earth, isn't it, Dave?

1:00:17.580 --> 1:00:21.217
Disneyland's got nothing on us.

1:00:23.252 --> 1:00:24.087
Hey, Dave?

1:00:26.155 --> 1:00:28.523
You got any kids?

1:00:28.524 --> 1:00:32.695
- It depends on whether
or not he's talking to me.

1:00:34.931 --> 1:00:36.165
- What does he look like?

1:00:38.001 --> 1:00:42.271
- Takes after his mother.
Good looking, not too bright.

1:00:44.340 --> 1:00:46.909
- I bet that makes him
popular with the girls, huh.

1:00:47.977 --> 1:00:48.745
- Oh yeah.

1:00:50.446 --> 1:00:53.816
I guess that makes him the
smartest kid in his class.

1:00:56.419 --> 1:01:01.324
So what room do you have free?

1:01:03.993 --> 1:01:05.994
- Why don't we find out?

1:01:05.995 --> 1:01:11.000
- Wow. Yeah.

1:01:15.905 --> 1:01:17.039
What?

1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:21.778
I'm sorry.

1:01:24.981 --> 1:01:26.348
- What's so funny?

1:01:26.349 --> 1:01:28.083
- Nothing, I...

1:01:35.625 --> 1:01:36.459
- Bitch.

1:01:46.269 --> 1:01:50.573
- Okay. Now, tell me your name.

1:01:52.108 --> 1:01:52.875
- Kay Leonard.

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:55.944
- No.

1:01:55.945 --> 1:01:58.948
- Yeah. Kay Eleanor Leonard.

1:01:59.882 --> 1:02:03.452
- This name, not $1,000 name.

1:02:03.453 --> 1:02:05.654
- Tough shit, buddy, you
agreed and I got the cash.

1:02:05.655 --> 1:02:10.125
- No, I mean merely you are too
beautiful to have this name.

1:02:10.126 --> 1:02:12.195
- I know. It's a dumb name, huh?

1:02:13.029 --> 1:02:14.931
- You, Kay Leonard.

1:02:15.898 --> 1:02:17.333
You have baby with me?

1:02:18.267 --> 1:02:19.901
- What?

1:02:19.902 --> 1:02:20.936
Are you nuts?

1:02:20.937 --> 1:02:22.170
Get out of here!

1:02:22.171 --> 1:02:23.371
- I want to have
bambino with you.

1:02:23.372 --> 1:02:26.074
- Okay, do not joke
about this. I'm serious.

1:02:26.075 --> 1:02:28.845
- I am serious too. Why not
you want to have baby with me?

1:02:30.279 --> 1:02:32.481
- You not exactly breaking
down the doors of romance.

1:02:32.482 --> 1:02:33.982
Just can it, okay?

1:02:33.983 --> 1:02:35.217
Is very romantic.

1:02:35.218 --> 1:02:36.218
- Oh, you want me
to have your bambino

1:02:36.219 --> 1:02:38.353
but you don't wanna marry me?

1:02:38.354 --> 1:02:42.691
- No, because then is
sure way to kill romance.

1:02:42.692 --> 1:02:44.760
- But it's okay for me
to vomit for three months

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:47.195
and then drop some kid on his
head that looks just like you?

1:02:47.196 --> 1:02:48.498
- Maybe like you too.

1:02:49.932 --> 1:02:51.200
I pay you a lot of money.

1:02:54.737 --> 1:02:55.505
- Okay.

1:02:57.640 --> 1:02:58.907
- What?

1:02:58.908 --> 1:02:59.675
- I'll do it.

1:03:01.177 --> 1:03:02.444
- You make joke, yes?

1:03:02.445 --> 1:03:04.447
- I make joke, no
come on, let's go.

1:03:05.915 --> 1:03:08.150
- What, now? Tonight?

1:03:08.151 --> 1:03:11.253
- Yeah, I'm ready. And I'm
gonna be a great mommy.

1:03:11.254 --> 1:03:13.088
You know as soon as I
get out of this place

1:03:13.089 --> 1:03:14.356
and I get a house.

1:03:14.357 --> 1:03:15.557
- Okay, wait!
- We need a four-bedroom house

1:03:15.558 --> 1:03:17.058
so that my family can
come live with us.

1:03:17.059 --> 1:03:18.560
- First maybe we talk. First
we talk. We talk. We talk.

1:03:18.561 --> 1:03:20.162
- And I want a Volvo 'cause
they're really safe for kids.

1:03:20.163 --> 1:03:21.663
- Of course. Oh, ow!

1:03:21.664 --> 1:03:23.932
Yeah. Okay. Oh, no, no, no, no.

1:03:23.933 --> 1:03:26.735
But first maybe we practice.

1:03:26.736 --> 1:03:28.503
- What's there to practice, huh?

1:03:28.504 --> 1:03:30.438
You're gonna take one of
those pre-natal classes?

1:03:30.439 --> 1:03:32.842
Learn how to change
diapers and shit?

1:03:37.747 --> 1:03:40.583
- You are such a
jokey girl, mami.

1:03:43.186 --> 1:03:45.621
- Yeah. I'm a jokey girl.

1:03:47.290 --> 1:03:49.525
And you are one weird dude.

1:03:52.995 --> 1:03:56.499
- And I have money.
Lots and lots of money.

1:03:58.768 --> 1:04:02.404
You know it's a good thing
you know how to fuck.

1:04:02.405 --> 1:04:04.740
- Life, she is, how do you say?

1:04:06.509 --> 1:04:08.411
Molto complicato. Si?

1:04:10.012 --> 1:04:12.281
Yeah. Molto complicato.

1:04:15.618 --> 1:04:18.688
- Already you begin
to learn Italian.

1:04:26.996 --> 1:04:28.230
- 10!

1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:33.935
This is my last trick.

1:04:33.936 --> 1:04:37.206
Watch carefully. When I'm done,
I'll tell you how it works.

1:04:39.275 --> 1:04:40.976
- I can't believe I
turned down Lance Burton

1:04:40.977 --> 1:04:41.878
to work with you.

1:04:45.715 --> 1:04:50.352
- So. I've been
doing these tricks.

1:04:50.353 --> 1:04:52.788
These lies, for
so many years now.

1:04:54.156 --> 1:04:56.359
It started as an easy
way to meet women.

1:04:57.393 --> 1:04:58.960
To get laid.

1:04:58.961 --> 1:05:00.830
To control the illusion.

1:05:02.031 --> 1:05:03.431
Funny thing about
the women, though.

1:05:03.432 --> 1:05:06.001
They always wanted me
to explain the tricks.

1:05:06.002 --> 1:05:08.036
You know, that's totally
taboo for magicians.

1:05:08.037 --> 1:05:09.537
You never give
away your secrets.

1:05:09.538 --> 1:05:13.476
But I figured, I was sleeping
with them, so what the hell.

1:05:15.478 --> 1:05:17.680
I did it. I'd give
away the tricks.

1:05:19.515 --> 1:05:20.815
And I gotta tell you
something, every time,

1:05:20.816 --> 1:05:22.684
every single time,

1:05:22.685 --> 1:05:24.719
they would get this
look on their faces,

1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:29.557
this look of disappointment.

1:05:29.558 --> 1:05:32.193
'Cause you're not just
telling them the trick.

1:05:32.194 --> 1:05:34.730
You're telling them there's
no such thing as magic.

1:05:36.132 --> 1:05:39.635
No perfect romance to
sweep them off their feet.

1:05:41.070 --> 1:05:42.637
After that, it was
just a matter of time.

1:05:42.638 --> 1:05:45.041
They would leave me,
or I would leave them.

1:05:45.908 --> 1:05:47.109
Usually it was mutual.

1:05:48.778 --> 1:05:50.812
They could never get that
look of disappointment

1:05:50.813 --> 1:05:51.881
off their faces.

1:05:53.582 --> 1:05:55.150
So, now I want to find a life

1:05:55.151 --> 1:05:57.252
that's not filled
with disappointment,

1:05:57.253 --> 1:05:58.955
I don't care where,

1:06:00.222 --> 1:06:02.792
just some place, authentic.

1:06:04.026 --> 1:06:06.428
'Cause when you're in that zone,

1:06:06.429 --> 1:06:08.898
and you're feeling authentic,

1:06:10.232 --> 1:06:12.567
well, there's nothing
disappointing about it.

1:06:16.772 --> 1:06:18.574
So this is my last trick.

1:06:23.646 --> 1:06:24.480
Forever.

1:06:29.485 --> 1:06:31.287
Voi-fucking-la.

1:06:34.824 --> 1:06:36.125
Hope you enjoyed the show.

1:06:38.627 --> 1:06:41.696
Right. Right. I was gonna
tell you how I did the trick.

1:06:41.697 --> 1:06:42.531
Well guess what?

1:06:44.867 --> 1:06:45.701
I lied.

1:06:47.036 --> 1:06:48.837
- I just couldn't
stay with Richard,

1:06:48.838 --> 1:06:50.439
he's just such a shitty painter.

1:06:52.842 --> 1:06:55.678
And Tom, lawyers,
what can you say?

1:06:57.079 --> 1:06:58.480
- Grace!
- Can you come down here?

1:06:58.481 --> 1:07:00.081
- I'm coming!

1:07:00.082 --> 1:07:01.850
There's Kelly, he's
a great businessman.

1:07:01.851 --> 1:07:05.254
Very rich, very smart,
very successful.

1:07:06.689 --> 1:07:09.924
Finally I gotta say, he's
just one shitty human being.

1:07:09.925 --> 1:07:12.628
Mean, self-centered, no loyalty.

1:07:13.662 --> 1:07:15.230
Short.

1:07:15.231 --> 1:07:17.432
Too damn short for his own good.

1:07:17.433 --> 1:07:19.668
Grace! Get
down here right away!

1:07:20.636 --> 1:07:21.704
- I am coming!

1:07:23.105 --> 1:07:24.172
What?

1:07:24.173 --> 1:07:25.340
- Surprise!

1:07:25.341 --> 1:07:26.175
Happy birthday!

1:07:29.812 --> 1:07:30.646
- Oh.

1:07:33.382 --> 1:07:35.850
- Oh come on.

1:07:35.851 --> 1:07:37.218
- Open it!

1:07:37.219 --> 1:07:38.987
Come on open it.

1:07:42.224 --> 1:07:43.324
- Are these real?

1:07:43.325 --> 1:07:44.160
- Yeah.

1:07:45.461 --> 1:07:47.495
- Wow! You shouldn't have.

1:07:47.496 --> 1:07:50.465
I haven't had a pearl
necklace in quite some time.

1:07:54.370 --> 1:07:55.204
- Hi.

1:07:55.205 --> 1:07:56.438
Hello.

1:07:56.439 --> 1:07:57.439
Happy birthday.

1:07:57.440 --> 1:07:59.007
- Oh, thank you.

1:07:59.008 --> 1:08:01.009
Get back to work up there.

1:08:01.010 --> 1:08:02.078
- Good night.

1:08:03.646 --> 1:08:04.480
- Happy birthday.

1:08:04.481 --> 1:08:05.713
- Thank you.

1:08:05.714 --> 1:08:06.715
- Thank you.

1:08:08.851 --> 1:08:10.785
- What are you doing here?

1:08:10.786 --> 1:08:14.189
- It's your birthday and I
got you a little something.

1:08:14.190 --> 1:08:16.826
Nice wrapping.

1:08:18.828 --> 1:08:19.662
Okay.

1:08:24.867 --> 1:08:26.868
Our high school yearbook?

1:08:26.869 --> 1:08:28.069
- Give it back, I'll get
you something different.

1:08:28.070 --> 1:08:29.771
- No, no.
- Come now, no really.

1:08:29.772 --> 1:08:30.939
- I want it.

1:08:30.940 --> 1:08:32.273
Why?

1:08:32.274 --> 1:08:33.775
- Well, I was trying to think,

1:08:33.776 --> 1:08:35.009
what could I possibly get you
that you don't already have?

1:08:35.010 --> 1:08:38.847
You know, me on a cop's
salary and you on yours.

1:08:38.848 --> 1:08:40.081
- There's Jeff McEwen.

1:08:40.082 --> 1:08:41.050
- And then I remembered

1:08:41.051 --> 1:08:42.484
that you left school two weeks

1:08:42.485 --> 1:08:45.186
before they gave the
yearbooks out, so, tadada.

1:08:45.187 --> 1:08:46.988
- Bill Nowicki's right here.

1:08:46.989 --> 1:08:49.825
- Yeah, I hear he's up
in Canada selling cars.

1:08:51.627 --> 1:08:54.729
- Oh, Tammy Paul. I liked her.

1:08:54.730 --> 1:08:56.965
- Oh, I hear that she died
actually, car accident.

1:08:56.966 --> 1:08:57.833
- Oh.

1:08:59.935 --> 1:09:03.037
Alex Racine. He was a nice guy.

1:09:03.038 --> 1:09:04.272
- He's gone too.

1:09:04.273 --> 1:09:06.709
- Oh, gee Keith, this
is a really great gift.

1:09:08.077 --> 1:09:10.545
- They're mostly still
alive, you just have to...

1:09:10.546 --> 1:09:12.080
- Okay.

1:09:12.081 --> 1:09:15.750
Oh, there she is, Miranda
Scanlon. How's she doing?

1:09:15.751 --> 1:09:16.951
- Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.

1:09:16.952 --> 1:09:17.786
- And the kids?

1:09:18.754 --> 1:09:20.655
- Almost out of the house.

1:09:20.656 --> 1:09:24.025
- Well if she's there, then
I bet you are right here.

1:09:26.529 --> 1:09:27.996
No, let me see.

1:09:27.997 --> 1:09:29.265
You were really cute.

1:09:30.499 --> 1:09:31.634
Didn't we go out once?

1:09:32.701 --> 1:09:33.768
- To the Senior Prom.

1:09:33.769 --> 1:09:34.603
- We did?

1:09:35.471 --> 1:09:37.006
- Gracie, you invited me.

1:09:38.307 --> 1:09:39.208
- Oh yeah.

1:09:40.676 --> 1:09:41.677
That was fun.

1:09:44.914 --> 1:09:46.048
You were nervous.

1:09:48.484 --> 1:09:51.085
- It was my first time, y'know.

1:09:51.086 --> 1:09:52.353
- I don't believe that.

1:09:52.354 --> 1:09:53.355
- You couldn't tell?

1:09:57.660 --> 1:09:59.727
- Whoo! You must've thought
I was some kind of slut,

1:09:59.728 --> 1:10:01.530
sleeping with you
on the first date.

1:10:02.998 --> 1:10:06.968
- No I'd say I had a bit of
a crush on you for a while.

1:10:06.969 --> 1:10:08.204
- You never told me that!

1:10:10.172 --> 1:10:11.273
- I was too shy.

1:10:12.374 --> 1:10:14.242
You were this
really popular girl

1:10:14.243 --> 1:10:15.643
and I was just this nerdy kid.

1:10:15.644 --> 1:10:18.147
Lemme show you something here.

1:10:20.816 --> 1:10:22.084
Voted "Most Beautiful."

1:10:30.025 --> 1:10:31.259
- Wow!

1:10:31.260 --> 1:10:32.861
How long'd you have
a crush on me for?

1:10:34.363 --> 1:10:36.097
- For a while.

1:10:36.098 --> 1:10:36.899
- A while?

1:10:38.167 --> 1:10:41.103
Bet you never got over me.

1:10:42.338 --> 1:10:43.105
- I never did.

1:10:47.076 --> 1:10:47.843
- I'm sorry.

1:10:49.011 --> 1:10:50.613
- Hey, there's nothing
to be sorry about.

1:10:54.283 --> 1:10:55.817
- It's my birthday.

1:10:55.818 --> 1:10:58.853
- Yes. Many happy returns.

1:11:02.591 --> 1:11:04.559
- I wanna show you
something. Upstairs.

1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:06.194
- What?

1:11:06.195 --> 1:11:07.695
What do you gonna show me?

1:11:07.696 --> 1:11:08.963
- Just relax, just
the music room.

1:11:08.964 --> 1:11:09.798
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:11:09.799 --> 1:11:11.032
What we gonna do?

1:11:11.033 --> 1:11:13.434
- You ever give yourself
a really great gift?

1:11:13.435 --> 1:11:14.669
- Yeah.

1:11:14.670 --> 1:11:16.137
- Like what?

1:11:16.138 --> 1:11:18.273
- Just last month, I got myself
a new pair of hiking boots.

1:11:19.508 --> 1:11:22.578
- No, I mean, a
really great gift.

1:11:24.313 --> 1:11:25.281
- You know, Miranda's
probably wondering

1:11:25.282 --> 1:11:26.548
where I am about now.

1:11:27.483 --> 1:11:28.784
- It's just this yearbook.

1:11:30.486 --> 1:11:32.186
It's like we're psychically
linked or something.

1:11:32.187 --> 1:11:33.088
Tonight it's so...

1:11:34.023 --> 1:11:34.857
- You think so?

1:11:36.225 --> 1:11:38.059
- I just don't know
how I missed you.

1:11:38.060 --> 1:11:38.894
- You what?

1:11:40.362 --> 1:11:42.430
- Missed. That you
were thinking about me.

1:11:42.431 --> 1:11:43.866
Come here, let's go.

1:11:44.967 --> 1:11:46.267
- Gracie.
- No.

1:11:46.268 --> 1:11:47.102
- Gracie, it's just.

1:11:47.102 --> 1:11:47.936
- No, come on.

1:11:47.937 --> 1:11:49.103
- Wait a minute.

1:11:49.104 --> 1:11:50.973
- This is my private room.

1:11:55.711 --> 1:11:56.679
- Wow.
- So,

1:11:56.680 --> 1:11:58.447
did you ever fantasize about me?

1:12:00.282 --> 1:12:03.485
Well, no, not in that way.

1:12:04.420 --> 1:12:06.921
- What way then?

1:12:06.922 --> 1:12:10.358
Well, y'know, I would see you
around town, or at the store.

1:12:10.359 --> 1:12:13.429
Or up here, and I'd just wonder.

1:12:16.865 --> 1:12:19.100
- What would you wonder?

1:12:19.101 --> 1:12:21.769
- What it would've
been like for us.

1:12:21.770 --> 1:12:23.304
Just, stuff.

1:12:23.305 --> 1:12:25.473
- Like, sex?

1:12:25.474 --> 1:12:30.479
- No, more like, uh,
marriage, and kids and stuff.

1:12:32.915 --> 1:12:34.582
- Marriage?

1:12:34.583 --> 1:12:36.184
- Well yeah.

1:12:36.185 --> 1:12:38.187
- I've got to be
honest with you, Keith.

1:12:39.054 --> 1:12:40.356
I'm not the marrying type.

1:12:41.757 --> 1:12:43.658
- But I bet you
could learn to be.

1:12:43.659 --> 1:12:45.193
- I don't think so.

1:12:45.194 --> 1:12:47.395
Never been able to spend
more than a couple months

1:12:47.396 --> 1:12:48.197
with a guy.

1:12:50.332 --> 1:12:51.400
I'm not that patient.

1:12:53.102 --> 1:12:56.004
- Yeah, but you could be,
if you had the right guy.

1:12:58.107 --> 1:12:59.074
- Oh, Keith.

1:13:01.677 --> 1:13:03.044
Keith.

1:13:03.045 --> 1:13:03.846
- What?

1:13:06.749 --> 1:13:09.985
- I had this plan tonight,
I even took these drugs.

1:13:10.953 --> 1:13:12.253
- Nothing illegal I hope.

1:13:12.254 --> 1:13:15.124
- No. Fertility drugs.

1:13:16.759 --> 1:13:17.693
- To have a baby?

1:13:20.062 --> 1:13:20.896
- Yeah.

1:13:21.830 --> 1:13:23.065
To have a baby of my own.

1:13:24.733 --> 1:13:26.834
I made an appointment,
with this old flame.

1:13:26.835 --> 1:13:30.405
I had this list of all
the men in my past,

1:13:30.406 --> 1:13:34.910
trying to find, you know,
the right genes, for my baby.

1:13:36.044 --> 1:13:37.211
- And they're coming
over here tonight?

1:13:37.212 --> 1:13:40.581
- No. No. He couldn't make it.

1:13:40.582 --> 1:13:43.885
Guess I forgot to check
on his dependability gene.

1:13:47.923 --> 1:13:50.893
You have such sweet eyes.

1:13:53.262 --> 1:13:54.096
- Do I?

1:13:55.564 --> 1:13:56.832
Well, thank you.

1:13:58.167 --> 1:13:59.535
- I had forgotten about you.

1:14:01.103 --> 1:14:03.371
I was making these
charts comparing IQ's

1:14:03.372 --> 1:14:06.307
and bank accounts and
the size of a guy's nose.

1:14:06.308 --> 1:14:10.879
And I think all I really
need for my baby is.

1:14:12.981 --> 1:14:13.816
- Is what?

1:14:16.785 --> 1:14:18.554
- Sweet-eyed kindness.

1:14:19.655 --> 1:14:20.956
You could give that to me.

1:14:24.726 --> 1:14:27.462
I just want someone
to pass it onto.

1:14:27.463 --> 1:14:30.299
Otherwise, it just
disappears when we do.

1:14:34.203 --> 1:14:35.037
- I can't do this.

1:14:35.038 --> 1:14:36.337
- Don't, why not?

1:14:36.338 --> 1:14:37.805
Why not?

1:14:37.806 --> 1:14:39.974
There are men here every night,
doing things with my girls,

1:14:39.975 --> 1:14:43.277
married men, they don't
think twice about it.

1:14:43.278 --> 1:14:45.980
- That's them, it's not me.

1:14:45.981 --> 1:14:47.081
And this is different.

1:14:47.082 --> 1:14:48.583
This is really different.

1:14:48.584 --> 1:14:50.885
- You'd never have to see us.

1:14:50.886 --> 1:14:51.887
No one would know.

1:14:53.922 --> 1:14:54.990
- I would know.

1:15:00.662 --> 1:15:03.664
- Our baby would have your eyes.

1:15:03.665 --> 1:15:05.300
- No, your eyes.

1:15:07.536 --> 1:15:10.572
- Okay, my eyes. And
your strong hands.

1:15:11.974 --> 1:15:12.875
Your goodness.

1:15:13.809 --> 1:15:16.043
And my business sense.

1:15:16.044 --> 1:15:18.179
- You are good at business.

1:15:18.180 --> 1:15:20.515
- And you were smart at school,

1:15:20.516 --> 1:15:24.886
so we'd have a strong,
smart, successful kid

1:15:24.887 --> 1:15:26.822
with your hands and my eyes.

1:15:28.023 --> 1:15:29.824
- This is getting
very complicated.

1:15:29.825 --> 1:15:34.830
- No, no, baby. It's
simple. It's real simple.

1:15:36.698 --> 1:15:38.133
'Cause I'm ready.

1:15:39.067 --> 1:15:41.035
And you're ready.

1:15:41.036 --> 1:15:42.304
And I want you.

1:15:47.009 --> 1:15:47.976
- Miranda...

1:15:50.379 --> 1:15:51.213
Miranda's...

1:15:52.581 --> 1:15:55.050
Miranda's probably wondering
where I am about now.

1:15:58.887 --> 1:16:00.622
- Yeah. Sure.

1:16:02.558 --> 1:16:03.492
Give her my best.

1:16:06.795 --> 1:16:10.264
- I don't think that she would
appreciate me visiting you.

1:16:10.265 --> 1:16:11.632
- Don't give her my best then.

1:16:11.633 --> 1:16:13.869
It'll be our secret,
it's sexier that way.

1:16:20.609 --> 1:16:21.443
Keith.

1:16:22.744 --> 1:16:23.579
I'm sorry.

1:16:42.331 --> 1:16:44.032
Now I feel like
shit for nothing.

1:17:13.095 --> 1:17:13.929
- Hey.

1:17:21.803 --> 1:17:24.206
I forgot you have brown eyes.

1:17:26.441 --> 1:17:28.310
Such beautiful,
beautiful brown eyes.

1:17:58.607 --> 1:17:59.441
- Oh fuck.

1:18:00.842 --> 1:18:02.711
I enjoyed your show tonight.

1:18:04.413 --> 1:18:05.646
- Good for you.

1:18:05.647 --> 1:18:07.215
- Now is that any
way to treat a fan?

1:18:11.053 --> 1:18:12.853
- You don't exactly
look like a fan.

1:18:12.854 --> 1:18:14.956
- What's a fan look like?

1:18:16.391 --> 1:18:19.326
- I dunno, let's just say
you look too sophisticated.

1:18:19.327 --> 1:18:21.696
So what are you doing down here?

1:18:21.697 --> 1:18:24.565
- I'm in town for a couple
days for a convention.

1:18:24.566 --> 1:18:26.668
- Oh, I heard, a high
tech thing, right?

1:18:27.836 --> 1:18:29.603
Well, you don't look
like a computer geek.

1:18:29.604 --> 1:18:31.839
- That's the second nicest
thing you've said to me.

1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:33.641
- Well you don't. What are
you? Like a programmer?

1:18:33.642 --> 1:18:36.510
- I'm, like, a CEO.

1:18:36.511 --> 1:18:37.412
- You have any openings?

1:18:37.413 --> 1:18:38.547
I'm looking for a new career.

1:18:39.781 --> 1:18:41.248
- For someone with
your people skills?

1:18:41.249 --> 1:18:43.085
I'm sure we can
find you something.

1:18:44.386 --> 1:18:46.455
- Sorry. You caught
me at a weird time.

1:18:52.427 --> 1:18:54.495
Hey, did you know that the
origin of the word career

1:18:54.496 --> 1:18:56.064
is actually of a journey?

1:18:57.165 --> 1:18:57.999
A road.

1:18:58.867 --> 1:19:00.568
The road we travel.

1:19:00.569 --> 1:19:01.803
- Construction ahead.

1:19:03.572 --> 1:19:05.139
Why don't you take a vacation?

1:19:05.140 --> 1:19:08.843
- Yeah. I'd last about
two days alone on a beach.

1:19:08.844 --> 1:19:10.212
- I managed four days once.

1:19:11.446 --> 1:19:13.080
Can't be alone.

1:19:13.081 --> 1:19:15.249
And I can't be with someone.

1:19:15.250 --> 1:19:16.218
It's terrible.

1:19:20.255 --> 1:19:21.523
So are you gonna miss it?

1:19:22.424 --> 1:19:24.091
- No.

1:19:24.092 --> 1:19:25.493
You know I counted them tonight.

1:19:25.494 --> 1:19:27.128
The tricks.

1:19:27.129 --> 1:19:28.729
This one, I never
have to do again.

1:19:28.730 --> 1:19:31.832
I'm done with the rings,
done with the ropes,

1:19:31.833 --> 1:19:33.134
done with the doves.

1:19:33.135 --> 1:19:34.202
No offense, Ralph.

1:19:35.537 --> 1:19:37.972
Finito all card tricks.

1:19:37.973 --> 1:19:40.875
- I think it's brave of
you to quit like that.

1:19:40.876 --> 1:19:43.410
- We'll see how brave
I am in two months.

1:19:43.411 --> 1:19:45.279
Is that why you stayed?
To tell me that?

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:48.149
- Partly. It's just,
you ever hear that joke?

1:19:48.150 --> 1:19:49.450
What joke?

1:19:49.451 --> 1:19:50.951
- You know.

1:19:50.952 --> 1:19:52.553
Who do you have to fuck to
get out of the business?

1:19:52.554 --> 1:19:54.488
- What business?

1:19:54.489 --> 1:19:55.490
- Any business.

1:19:57.759 --> 1:20:00.694
- Okay, is there a
punchline to this joke?

1:20:00.695 --> 1:20:02.230
- No. That is the joke.

1:20:03.431 --> 1:20:05.399
Who do you have to,
you know, to get...

1:20:05.400 --> 1:20:07.334
- To get out, who do you
have to fuck to get out, oh.

1:20:07.335 --> 1:20:08.669
- Yeah.

1:20:08.670 --> 1:20:09.504
- That's funny.

1:20:10.906 --> 1:20:13.107
Could have used that one
in my routine tonight.

1:20:13.108 --> 1:20:15.376
- Well, tonight you answered
that question for me.

1:20:15.377 --> 1:20:16.410
- I did?

1:20:16.411 --> 1:20:17.212
- Yeah.

1:20:18.079 --> 1:20:19.481
The answer is, no one.

1:20:20.515 --> 1:20:21.715
You don't need to fuck anyone

1:20:21.716 --> 1:20:23.251
to do what you know
you need to do.

1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:26.655
- Glad to see I could help.

1:20:28.557 --> 1:20:30.391
- So where are you going?

1:20:30.392 --> 1:20:32.326
- I dunno, New York maybe.

1:20:32.327 --> 1:20:36.598
- No, I mean, where are
you going right now?

1:20:38.033 --> 1:20:39.800
- You want to get a
drink or something?

1:20:39.801 --> 1:20:40.769
- I wanna get dinner.

1:20:41.903 --> 1:20:42.671
- You buying?

1:20:44.306 --> 1:20:45.540
- How 'bout we go dutch?

1:20:46.474 --> 1:20:47.275
What's your name?

1:20:48.944 --> 1:20:51.146
- Can't you read? It's
Magno the Magnificent.

1:20:53.481 --> 1:20:54.249
Or Jack.

1:20:56.418 --> 1:20:58.552
What's your name?
- Nancy.

1:20:58.553 --> 1:21:01.356
- When I was a kid, I used to
have a crush on Nancy Drew.

1:21:02.591 --> 1:21:05.125
- Hope I can live up
to your expectations.

1:21:05.126 --> 1:21:06.827
You forget, I
am done with mystery.

1:21:06.828 --> 1:21:09.897
And I have absolutely
no expectations.

1:21:09.898 --> 1:21:13.468
As of tonight, I am a
blank slate. A tabula rasa.

1:21:14.970 --> 1:21:17.404
- In that case, Jack, let's go.

1:21:17.405 --> 1:21:18.773
I am starving.

1:21:22.077 --> 1:21:24.111
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

1:21:24.112 --> 1:21:25.814
- Right. Just dinner.

1:21:37.792 --> 1:21:39.961
It's in case you get cold.

1:21:45.367 --> 1:21:49.069
My God.

1:21:49.070 --> 1:21:49.838
- What?

1:21:51.806 --> 1:21:53.041
- What if it's a boy?

1:22:13.762 --> 1:22:16.831
- That's it, come
on in, have a seat.

1:22:18.266 --> 1:22:20.501
Where's the fucking chair,
get her a chair, goddammit!

1:22:20.502 --> 1:22:21.735
That stupid bitch
moved the chair.

1:22:21.736 --> 1:22:24.238
Somebody ought to nail
the fucking thing down!

1:22:24.239 --> 1:22:26.006
Why don't you make yourself
useful and get me a cappuccino!

1:22:26.007 --> 1:22:28.742
Make sure it's hot, the
last one, fucking cold.

1:22:28.743 --> 1:22:29.577
Hot!

1:22:31.179 --> 1:22:32.413
Yes!

1:22:32.414 --> 1:22:34.682
Your agent sent me your resume.

1:22:34.683 --> 1:22:36.184
Where's the fucking resume?

1:22:39.821 --> 1:22:41.221
You're very beautiful.

1:22:41.222 --> 1:22:42.690
You must get a lot of
compliments around this town.

1:22:42.691 --> 1:22:44.658
Lots of attention.
How tall are you?

1:22:44.659 --> 1:22:47.995
Now with heels on, you're
quite, well, quite statuesque.

1:22:47.996 --> 1:22:49.430
Of course, you know this
could be a slight problem

1:22:49.431 --> 1:22:51.265
with our star.

1:22:51.266 --> 1:22:53.500
He's a bit, well, short.

1:22:53.501 --> 1:22:55.169
Practically a dwarf
in comparison to you.

1:22:55.170 --> 1:22:56.670
On the other hand,

1:22:56.671 --> 1:22:58.205
the scene is mostly of a
lying down nature, isn't it?

1:22:58.206 --> 1:23:02.344
We'll just put a pin in the
whole, height issue, shall we?

1:23:04.913 --> 1:23:07.082
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1:23:17.692 --> 1:23:18.959
Beautiful dress you have on.

1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:20.661
Very elegant. Shows off
your legs quite nicely.

1:23:20.662 --> 1:23:21.795
Is that your own hair?

1:23:21.796 --> 1:23:23.163
I hope you don't mind my asking,

1:23:23.164 --> 1:23:25.132
just these days with extensions,
you can't really tell.

1:23:31.539 --> 1:23:32.374
Hello?

1:23:34.042 --> 1:23:35.042
Mother?

1:23:35.043 --> 1:23:35.977
Yes.

1:23:35.978 --> 1:23:38.213
Listen, can I call you back?

1:23:43.385 --> 1:23:46.820
I'm in the middle
of working, mother.

1:23:46.821 --> 1:23:48.656
I'll call you back, yes, yeah.

1:23:51.059 --> 1:23:53.561
Yeah, yes, love
you too... Good-bye.

1:24:01.436 --> 1:24:04.205
Well, let's have
you read, shall we?

1:24:08.610 --> 1:24:10.745
- How far do you
wanna take this?

1:24:12.514 --> 1:24:13.348
- Excuse me?

1:24:14.282 --> 1:24:15.883
- The director thing.

1:24:15.884 --> 1:24:17.552
That's cool, very cool.

1:24:21.756 --> 1:24:26.761
Mr. Director, oh, I really,
really want this role.

1:24:35.036 --> 1:24:37.705
- You are an
actress, aren't you?

1:24:41.376 --> 1:24:43.044
- You did call
Grace, didn't you?

1:24:44.446 --> 1:24:49.451
- Grace is your, uh... manager?

1:24:53.388 --> 1:24:55.723
- Oh, I am really, really sorry.

1:24:57.125 --> 1:25:00.562
There's no charge.
There'll be no charge.

1:25:03.131 --> 1:25:07.569
- Actually, you really could be.

1:25:10.805 --> 1:25:11.639
- Yes?

1:25:13.475 --> 1:25:16.644
- Do you have any
problem with nudity?

1:25:25.887 --> 1:25:26.988
- No problem.

1:25:28.623 --> 1:25:29.557
No problem.

1:25:31.126 --> 1:25:33.160
No problem here.

1:25:33.161 --> 1:25:35.029
Oh, that'll cost you extra.

1:25:36.297 --> 1:25:37.198
No problem.

1:25:38.266 --> 1:25:39.334
I can handle it.

1:25:44.205 --> 1:25:47.208
- Well, um, we could
meet up over there?

1:25:50.778 --> 1:25:53.648
Say, after the day's
over, at my place,

1:25:54.883 --> 1:25:57.217
learn a bit more about the role.

1:25:57.218 --> 1:25:58.919
And you, I mean,

1:25:58.920 --> 1:26:01.889
you really are quite
right for the part,

1:26:01.890 --> 1:26:04.491
I just really would
need to read you.

1:26:04.492 --> 1:26:08.095
I mean have you read something
