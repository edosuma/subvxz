00:03.766 --> 00:06.515
- (Indistinct radio transmission)
- Man: Damn.

00:06.516 --> 00:08.467
- (Car door closes)
Man 2: This is going down.

00:08.468 --> 00:10.719
He's gonna kill us, you know.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.054
He's gonna kill us.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.355
Be cool, Tre.

00:13.356 --> 00:14.606
Hands on the wheel.

00:14.607 --> 00:17.309
(Indistinct radio transmissions)

00:17.310 --> 00:18.610
Officer: Evening.

00:18.611 --> 00:21.230
Woman: Be cool.

00:21.231 --> 00:25.166
You know you're driving
with a busted taillight?

00:28.488 --> 00:29.905
Woman: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:29.906 --> 00:31.472
Jesus!

00:35.662 --> 00:37.663
(Officer groaning)

00:37.664 --> 00:39.164
(Panting)

00:39.165 --> 00:41.278
(Groaning)

00:41.279 --> 00:43.258
- (Approaching sirens wailing)
- Tre, we got to get out of here.

00:43.259 --> 00:44.775
Tre.

00:45.428 --> 00:47.179
- (Horn blaring)
- Tre.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.397
(Blaring continues)

00:48.398 --> 00:50.281
Tre!

00:51.684 --> 00:54.490
The Cuban Foreign Minister
has arrived at the embassy.

00:54.491 --> 00:56.001
He's just about to start his remarks.

00:56.002 --> 00:57.452
He's just gonna give the party line...

00:57.453 --> 00:59.375
America bad, Cuba good.

00:59.376 --> 01:01.767
It's the reopening of the
Cuban embassy in D.C.

01:01.768 --> 01:02.935
After 54 years.

01:02.936 --> 01:04.236
It's historic.

01:04.236 --> 01:06.101
So we're okay with giving
the Cubans network airtime

01:06.102 --> 01:07.569
to broadcast propaganda?

01:07.570 --> 01:09.154
I hardly think Foreign Minister Barzan

01:09.155 --> 01:11.356
is gonna use his speech to America bash.

01:11.357 --> 01:12.991
Then why did we decide
to skip the ceremony?

01:12.992 --> 01:14.943
Because opening Cuba is controversial

01:14.944 --> 01:16.278
and Madam Secretary felt that...

01:16.279 --> 01:18.247
Didn't trust that he won't go all,

01:18.248 --> 01:19.915
"blah, blah, blah, the American embargo

01:19.916 --> 01:22.534
is a crime against the
good people of Cuba,"

01:22.535 --> 01:24.453
and she'll be standing there
looking like the bad guy.

01:24.454 --> 01:26.205
My, my, somebody woke up

01:26.206 --> 01:27.673
on the cynical side of
the bed this morning.

01:27.674 --> 01:30.018
I just question the wisdom of negotiating

01:30.019 --> 01:32.270
with oppressive dictators
who jail dissidents

01:32.271 --> 01:33.438
and prohibit free speech.

01:33.439 --> 01:35.524
Matt... I know, you've
explained your position.

01:35.525 --> 01:37.242
And you have remained
steadfast in yours,

01:37.243 --> 01:39.528
which is troubling because
I'm headed down to Cuba

01:39.529 --> 01:42.330
in a few days to reopen the
American embassy there

01:42.331 --> 01:44.366
and you're my speechwriter.

01:44.367 --> 01:47.369
Ma'am, I can keep my
personal beliefs to myself.

01:47.370 --> 01:48.620
How I wish that were true.

01:48.621 --> 01:50.255
Elizabeth: I appreciate your candor, Matt,

01:50.256 --> 01:51.550
but my Cuba speech is too important

01:51.551 --> 01:53.685
to entrust to a writer who's
simply toeing the party line.

01:53.686 --> 01:55.638
- Ma'am...
- It's not punishment.

01:55.639 --> 01:57.190
I know it's difficult
to do your best work

01:57.191 --> 01:58.641
when you don't believe in the cause.

01:58.642 --> 02:01.311
I know that I would have a very hard time

02:01.312 --> 02:03.470
writing anything nice about kale.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.982
Which is why I'm thrilled
that you will be writing

02:05.983 --> 02:07.784
my remarks for the World
Food Prize Lunch.

02:07.785 --> 02:09.151
(Chuckles)

02:09.152 --> 02:10.902
So, uh...

02:10.904 --> 02:13.072
Who-who's going to write
your Cuba speech?

02:13.073 --> 02:14.791
- I will.
- Nadine: Here's the ambassador.

02:14.792 --> 02:18.044
On behalf of the people
and government of Cuba,

02:18.045 --> 02:22.799
I welcome a new day
in U.S.-Cuban relations.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.234
(Applause)

02:31.202 --> 02:32.392
Alison: It was nothing.

02:32.393 --> 02:34.093
- No big deal.
- You were in a car accident, Alison.

02:34.094 --> 02:36.062
- That's a big deal.
- Okay, look.

02:36.063 --> 02:38.097
Here's the dent. You can barely see it.

02:38.098 --> 02:39.432
Wait a minute.

02:39.433 --> 02:42.505
You-you posted pictures of
your accident on social media?

02:42.506 --> 02:43.745
- Okay, that's not the...
- And you're smiling?

02:43.746 --> 02:44.745
Do you think this is funny?

02:44.746 --> 02:45.738
Elizabeth: What happened?

02:45.739 --> 02:47.523
Alison was in a car accident.

02:47.524 --> 02:49.108
- Okay, no.
- What?

02:49.109 --> 02:50.693
I... I dented the Fender

02:50.694 --> 02:51.944
on a concrete barrier

02:51.945 --> 02:53.997
backing out of a tight
parking spot at the mall.

02:53.998 --> 02:56.115
I took it in for repairs
and paid for it myself.

02:56.116 --> 02:58.418
And told 2,000 of her
friends but not us.

02:58.419 --> 03:01.087
I had to find out from Wayne
at Accurate Autoworks.

03:01.088 --> 03:03.039
I told him not to say anything.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.924
What? You asked Wayne to lie for you?

03:04.925 --> 03:06.926
No, I just said it's not a big
deal, don't tell my parents.

03:06.927 --> 03:08.294
My God.

03:08.295 --> 03:10.513
There was an accident and a cover-up.

03:10.514 --> 03:11.721
It's like having Nixon in our kitchen.

03:11.722 --> 03:13.088
- Alison: Are you kidding? Nixon?
- Elizabeth: Okay.

03:13.089 --> 03:14.250
- Why don't you go upstairs.
- Thank you.

03:14.251 --> 03:15.685
Let your dad and me talk, please.

03:15.686 --> 03:18.971
Alison: Nixon? Really?

03:18.972 --> 03:21.641
There is a case to be made

03:21.642 --> 03:23.476
that she was being responsible.

03:23.477 --> 03:26.145
You know, she took it in to the shop,

03:26.146 --> 03:28.314
paid for the damages herself.

03:28.315 --> 03:29.699
It was a misguided attempt,

03:29.700 --> 03:31.901
but she was trying to be an adult.

03:31.902 --> 03:33.286
But she's not an adult.

03:33.287 --> 03:34.487
And I'm starting to think

03:34.488 --> 03:35.822
maybe she shouldn't come to Cuba.

03:35.823 --> 03:37.373
She shouldn't be rewarded for this.

03:37.374 --> 03:39.292
Well, you know,

03:39.293 --> 03:43.162
48 hours of spotty to
non-existent Cuban Internet

03:43.163 --> 03:45.131
will be more than enough
punishment for her.

03:45.132 --> 03:47.717
Besides, I think that getting away

03:47.718 --> 03:49.252
might be good for her, and, you know,

03:49.253 --> 03:51.637
could maybe be good for you, too.

03:51.638 --> 03:53.639
Get your mind off of
losing your student.

03:53.640 --> 03:54.891
Yeah.

03:54.892 --> 03:56.191
How'd you sleep last night?

03:57.219 --> 03:58.344
Jason: How about Markes?

03:58.345 --> 04:00.096
It's pretty crazy, huh?

04:00.097 --> 04:01.180
What are you talking about?

04:01.181 --> 04:02.065
It's all over the news...

04:02.066 --> 04:03.099
Markes is resigning.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.583
Senator Markes?

04:05.319 --> 04:06.519
Yeah.

04:06.520 --> 04:07.687
Is resigning?

04:07.688 --> 04:09.188
Yeah.

04:09.189 --> 04:11.441
Senator Gregg Markes is resigning?

04:11.442 --> 04:13.409
Why does she keep asking me that?

04:13.410 --> 04:14.861
Processing the ramifications.

04:14.862 --> 04:17.529
- Which are?
- I-I... I h-have to go.

04:17.531 --> 04:20.048
- Here, go.
- Yeah. I have to go.

04:21.285 --> 04:23.035
(Door opening)

04:23.036 --> 04:25.004
Your mom's about to change the world.

04:25.005 --> 04:26.122
(Door closes)

04:26.123 --> 04:28.424
Elizabeth: What's the latest?

04:28.425 --> 04:29.542
So, Markes was...

04:29.543 --> 04:30.877
Was pulled over for driving the wrong way

04:30.878 --> 04:32.044
down a one-way street

04:32.045 --> 04:33.596
and then failed a field sobriety test.

04:33.597 --> 04:35.131
And the woman who he was with...

04:35.132 --> 04:36.766
- Who was not his wife.
- ...had half...

04:36.767 --> 04:38.267
A half ounce of cocaine on her.

04:38.268 --> 04:40.720
- And Markes...
- Then tried to bribe the arresting officer

04:40.721 --> 04:43.022
by telling him that he could
give him a big promotion

04:43.023 --> 04:44.724
if he made the charges go away.

04:44.725 --> 04:46.612
And all of that would've
been bad enough except...

04:46.613 --> 04:47.393
Okay, let me tell it.

04:47.394 --> 04:48.611
The whole thing was caught on video

04:48.612 --> 04:49.779
by someone who recognized him.

04:49.780 --> 04:51.364
Sorry, Blake, I heard that
part on the drive over.

04:51.365 --> 04:52.532
No problem, ma'am.

04:52.533 --> 04:53.983
Being interrupted by you is a pleasure.

04:53.984 --> 04:55.785
But, uh, if I may, what
does this have to do

04:55.786 --> 04:56.903
with the State Department?

04:56.904 --> 04:59.288
Okay, what do we know about Markes?

04:59.289 --> 05:01.157
- He was a cheater.
- And a liar.

05:01.158 --> 05:03.075
Heads out of the tabloids, think policy.

05:03.076 --> 05:05.745
He was head of the Foreign
Relations Committee.

05:05.746 --> 05:07.130
Wait, so he was the man responsible

05:07.131 --> 05:08.748
for controlling what came up for a vote.

05:08.749 --> 05:09.799
And he stymied us

05:09.800 --> 05:12.385
on Cuba last spring.

05:12.386 --> 05:14.220
And now that he's out of the
way, you're going to try...

05:14.221 --> 05:16.187
Wait. Let Blake say it.

05:16.924 --> 05:18.925
You're going to try to bring a bill

05:18.926 --> 05:21.761
to the floor of the senate
and lift the embargo on Cuba.

05:21.762 --> 05:24.013
And how cool would it be to announce that

05:24.014 --> 05:25.431
when we reopen the embassy?

05:25.432 --> 05:27.350
That's in 48 hours.

05:27.351 --> 05:30.368
(Laughs) Well, we better get to work.

05:45.112 --> 05:48.898
The entire eastern border
of Ukraine is on high alert.

05:48.899 --> 05:51.317
And needless to say, after
the cyber attack on his plane,

05:51.318 --> 05:53.736
President Bozek remains profoundly shaken

05:53.737 --> 05:55.071
by the attempt on his life.

05:55.072 --> 05:56.823
Jackson: I have to hand it
to President Ostrov.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.572
It would've been a masterstroke:

05:58.573 --> 06:01.291
Decapitate the duly elected
leader of the Ukraine,

06:01.292 --> 06:04.411
thereby clearing the way for
a full-scale Russian invasion.

06:04.412 --> 06:05.912
We must push back, Mr. President,

06:05.913 --> 06:08.164
and push back hard.

06:08.165 --> 06:10.884
And your recommendation is?

06:10.885 --> 06:12.669
Dispatch U.S. military
advisers to Ukraine.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.921
Send a message to the Kremlin

06:14.922 --> 06:18.425
that Ukraine and the U.S.
stand united against them.

06:18.426 --> 06:19.843
I'm not sure that's the message

06:19.844 --> 06:21.811
that we want to send at this time, sir.

06:21.812 --> 06:23.730
The Russians will view

06:23.731 --> 06:25.612
the presence of American forces in Kiev

06:25.613 --> 06:28.866
as an escalation that would
have to be met in kind.

06:28.867 --> 06:32.035
Sir, this is one of those moments

06:32.036 --> 06:33.905
that defines a presidency.

06:33.906 --> 06:38.742
The Dalton White House must
be seen as strong, unyielding.

06:38.743 --> 06:40.078
Help me out here, Russell.

06:40.079 --> 06:41.963
I'm afraid I agree
with Elizabeth on this.

06:41.964 --> 06:43.748
I thought you brought me
into this administration

06:43.749 --> 06:46.801
to, in your words, "tighten
the reins on foreign policy."

06:46.802 --> 06:50.004
Dalton: Let's set up a call
with President Ostrov.

06:50.005 --> 06:52.173
Perhaps a, uh, more personal approach

06:52.174 --> 06:53.557
can do something

06:53.558 --> 06:55.425
to diffuse the situation.

06:55.426 --> 06:58.228
Now, Bess, uh, you wanted
to talk about Cuba?

06:58.229 --> 07:00.514
Yes.

07:00.515 --> 07:03.600
Senator Markes' resignation

07:03.601 --> 07:05.602
releases his stranglehold

07:05.603 --> 07:07.020
on senate foreign relations.

07:07.021 --> 07:08.905
The bill to lift the embargo,
it's already passed the house.

07:08.906 --> 07:11.992
We just need 60 senators
to prevent a filibuster.

07:11.993 --> 07:13.243
You think you have the votes?

07:13.244 --> 07:14.411
Close. I mean, it depends on

07:14.412 --> 07:16.196
how much political capital
you want to expend.

07:16.197 --> 07:17.364
Jackson: It could be done.

07:17.365 --> 07:19.616
Think of the legacy you would leave.

07:19.617 --> 07:21.585
A Cuba open to U.S. business interests,

07:21.586 --> 07:23.787
a-a toehold for democracy

07:23.788 --> 07:26.757
in one of our most bitter enemies.

07:26.758 --> 07:28.959
The optics for your re-election
campaign would be good.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.260
Plenty of American flags waving.

07:30.261 --> 07:32.879
- Craig?
- Florida has

07:32.880 --> 07:34.631
29 electoral votes.

07:34.632 --> 07:36.800
Miami is the key to locking those up.

07:36.801 --> 07:39.686
Why alienate the anti-Castro
base down there?

07:39.687 --> 07:41.138
Policy aside, the politics

07:41.139 --> 07:43.140
of this are suicidal.

07:43.141 --> 07:45.475
Sometimes politics has to take a backseat

07:45.476 --> 07:46.643
to doing the right thing.

07:46.644 --> 07:48.645
Sir, this is one of those moments

07:48.646 --> 07:50.781
that define a presidency.

07:50.782 --> 07:52.065
All right.

07:52.066 --> 07:54.818
I understand that passions
run deep on this issue.

07:54.819 --> 07:59.489
But since it's my call...

07:59.490 --> 08:02.591
Hell, let's make some history.

08:03.544 --> 08:05.829
If you two can put the votes
together, let's do it.

08:05.830 --> 08:08.131
Sorry, Craig.

08:08.132 --> 08:09.916
This doesn't seem to be your day.

08:09.917 --> 08:11.968
It's never about me, sir.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.736
I serve at the pleasure of the president.

08:16.057 --> 08:18.008
I can't thank you enough for
your support, Senator Armstrong,

08:18.009 --> 08:20.177
and as soon as Madam
Secretary gets back in,

08:20.178 --> 08:21.978
I'm sure that she will
give you a call herself.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.231
Thanks. Yes.

08:24.232 --> 08:25.849
Hey, we got Armstrong.

08:25.850 --> 08:27.601
Just five more

08:27.602 --> 08:30.629
and we have liftoff.

08:30.630 --> 08:32.371
Micelli's a maybe. He needs
a call from the secretary.

08:32.373 --> 08:33.323
- On it.
- Hey, what's going on?

08:33.323 --> 08:34.573
Well, with Markes out of the way,

08:34.575 --> 08:36.777
the President gave his
blessing to lift the embargo

08:36.778 --> 08:38.445
and now we just need to get the votes.

08:38.446 --> 08:39.863
So Madam Secretary
is up on the Hill

08:39.864 --> 08:42.282
and we're calling senators,
and we've been here all night

08:42.283 --> 08:43.533
and I've had a lot of coffee.

08:43.534 --> 08:45.721
Am I talking fast?
I feel like I'm talking fast.

08:45.722 --> 08:47.474
Why didn't you guys call me in?

08:47.475 --> 08:48.808
She's writing the speech.

08:48.809 --> 08:51.645
A speech that just went
from perfunctory to historic.

08:51.646 --> 08:53.446
You're right. Sucks to be you.

08:53.447 --> 08:55.766
Lifting the embargo on Cuba is huge.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.384
It could get Dalton a second term.

08:57.385 --> 08:58.885
I have to be a part of this.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.972
She's going to need background
and research and imagery.

09:01.973 --> 09:04.357
That's what I do best... verbal imagery.

09:04.358 --> 09:06.943
You know, to some, a simple
schoolhouse whiteboard,

09:06.944 --> 09:09.962
but to those in the know,
a referendum on democracy.

09:15.036 --> 09:17.404
I hear you're thinking about
voting to lift the embargo.

09:17.405 --> 09:18.872
How can I help?

09:18.873 --> 09:22.125
Minnesotans have a lot to
offer the people of Cuba.

09:22.126 --> 09:25.412
Few other Midwestern farming
powers share our proximity

09:25.413 --> 09:27.130
to the mighty Mississippi...

09:27.131 --> 09:29.783
Michelle, our kids go to
the same orthodontist.

09:29.784 --> 09:32.919
I consider you a friend, you
can cut the speechifying.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.471
What do you want?

09:34.472 --> 09:35.889
First dibs.

09:35.890 --> 09:37.340
First dibs?

09:37.341 --> 09:40.477
Specifically $100,000 in
federal money to identify

09:40.478 --> 09:43.096
existing and emerging
opportunities in Cuba

09:43.097 --> 09:45.932
for Minnesota's agricultural producers.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.018
Dan Sparks is already sponsoring a bill

09:48.019 --> 09:50.904
that would give Wyoming
those federal dollars.

09:50.905 --> 09:54.373
Well, that's too bad then, isn't it?

09:55.109 --> 09:59.496
Michelle, I-I really need your vote.

09:59.497 --> 10:02.264
I know you do.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.620
Dan, I need you to drop S.3487.

10:07.621 --> 10:08.922
No way.

10:08.923 --> 10:11.041
I'm giving you my Cuba
vote so I can get in there

10:11.042 --> 10:12.959
and scare up some business for Wyoming.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.094
I'm gonna need that money.

10:14.095 --> 10:15.962
Well, Michelle Porter needs it more.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.548
She should've sponsored
her own damn bill then.

10:18.549 --> 10:20.133
Come on, there has to
be something you need

10:20.134 --> 10:22.185
more than $100,000 to send

10:22.186 --> 10:24.903
a couple of guys down to Cuba a
month ahead of the competition?

10:28.142 --> 10:31.210
I really need your help on this.

10:32.863 --> 10:36.282
Have you ever been to the
Wind River Mountain Range?

10:36.283 --> 10:39.119
I-I have not.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.045
Neither have millions of other
people who love spending

10:41.046 --> 10:43.156
their tourist dollars in national parks.

10:43.157 --> 10:47.627
Getting a national parks
designation is a tall order.

10:47.628 --> 10:51.129
How badly do you want
this embargo lifted?

10:53.417 --> 10:55.468
Jackson: The President would love
to visit the Wind River Mountains.

10:55.469 --> 10:57.003
He's heard they're beautiful

10:57.004 --> 10:59.672
and worthy of national park status.

10:59.673 --> 11:02.351
How does, uh, next Tuesday look

11:02.352 --> 11:04.177
for a helicopter tour?

11:04.178 --> 11:05.645
- (Elevator bell dings)
- I've done a bunch of research

11:05.646 --> 11:07.063
and I jotted down some ideas
for your Cuba speech.

11:07.064 --> 11:08.431
- I told you...
- You're writing the speech.

11:08.432 --> 11:10.517
I know, but I have an idea
that I wanted to swing by you.

11:10.518 --> 11:11.768
You're adorable.

11:11.769 --> 11:14.404
- I am?
- You disagree with the policy

11:14.405 --> 11:16.606
but you still want to
write the speech anyway

11:16.607 --> 11:18.691
because you think it may
just have become historic.

11:18.692 --> 11:20.326
And that's adorable?

11:20.327 --> 11:23.079
Yes. In a self-serving,

11:23.080 --> 11:24.697
craven kind of way.

11:24.698 --> 11:25.915
Thank you.

11:25.916 --> 11:29.035
But I'm looking for
sincere and heartfelt.

11:29.036 --> 11:32.705
I sincerely want to help
you write this speech.

11:32.706 --> 11:34.874
I read your kale remarks.
They need some work.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.383
It's a first draft, maybe a second.

11:36.384 --> 11:38.573
I'll fix it, I will. But I have
an idea that I think you'll r...

11:38.574 --> 11:42.276
Matt, don't tell me what
you're going to do.

11:42.277 --> 11:45.179
Show me.

11:45.180 --> 11:47.948
Okay ma'am, that's what I'll do.

11:47.949 --> 11:50.117
Porter and Sparks are
firmly in the yes column.

11:50.118 --> 11:52.119
Great. I-I will call Esposito

11:52.120 --> 11:53.754
and Russell and I are
double-teaming Thornquist.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.656
Those two votes and that's it, we get it.

11:55.657 --> 11:58.626
Ma'am, uh, your 3:00 is in your office.

11:58.627 --> 12:00.928
Okay, my 3:00 better not be a senator

12:00.929 --> 12:04.063
wanting something shiny
in return for a vote.

12:06.534 --> 12:08.269
- (door opens)
- (shutter clicks)

12:08.270 --> 12:09.603
I'm not going to Cuba.

12:09.604 --> 12:13.507
Well, good afternoon to you too, Noodle.

12:13.508 --> 12:15.776
Dad's still mad at me about
the car and you'll be busy,

12:15.777 --> 12:17.611
so it'll just be me and him.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.647
He is really looking forward

12:19.648 --> 12:21.215
to spending time with you.

12:21.216 --> 12:22.783
To lecture me on the perils of lying.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.319
You're being unfair.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.720
He's the one being unfair.

12:26.721 --> 12:29.490
Stevie can't go 'cause of
her stupid Microloans job

12:29.491 --> 12:31.158
and Jason has standardized tests.

12:31.159 --> 12:33.260
Why do I have to be the only one going?

12:33.261 --> 12:35.429
You know, I'm having a hard time

12:35.430 --> 12:38.199
ginning up sympathy
for a kid who is getting

12:38.200 --> 12:41.268
- a front-row seat to history.
- But, Mom...

12:41.269 --> 12:43.037
No. Out.

12:43.038 --> 12:45.773
- (sighs)
- You don't want to lose me as your ally.

12:45.774 --> 12:49.009
And whining is not
working in your favor.

12:49.010 --> 12:50.444
Look, your dad

12:50.445 --> 12:53.848
is going through a lot right now.

12:53.849 --> 12:55.916
A student of his committed suicide,

12:55.917 --> 12:57.952
and he's taking it pretty hard.

12:57.953 --> 12:59.386
Well, how would I have known that?

12:59.387 --> 13:01.021
It's not like he tells me anything.

13:01.022 --> 13:03.257
It's not easy for him to talk about,

13:03.258 --> 13:04.925
which is why I'm telling you.

13:04.926 --> 13:06.794
Try to be understanding.

13:06.795 --> 13:10.731
Try and muster some
enthusiasm about this trip.

13:10.732 --> 13:15.001
Because whether you like
it or not, you are going.

13:16.303 --> 13:18.738
(chuckles)

13:21.041 --> 13:23.409
(laughing, indistinct conversations)

13:31.952 --> 13:33.621
Hal...

13:33.622 --> 13:35.523
you've been avoiding my calls.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.591
I'm trying to enjoy my dinner,
Russell. I'd invite you

13:37.592 --> 13:40.127
to join me but we really don't
have anything to talk about.

13:40.128 --> 13:43.564
You know Elizabeth McCord?

13:43.565 --> 13:46.467
- Hi.
- I got both of you.

13:46.468 --> 13:49.837
I must be the last vote you need.
(short chuckle)

13:49.838 --> 13:51.906
Idaho raises sugar beets.

13:51.907 --> 13:54.675
Cuba's biggest export
is sugar. I'm a firm no.

13:54.676 --> 13:56.977
We can keep tariffs on Cuban sugar high.

13:56.978 --> 13:59.513
No way you can keep 'em high
enough to protect my farmers.

13:59.514 --> 14:01.448
Now why don't the two
of you just skedaddle,

14:01.449 --> 14:03.517
let me finish my dinner in peace.

14:03.518 --> 14:07.154
See, I wish you'd taken my
call, 'cause then I wouldn't

14:07.155 --> 14:09.490
have to embarrass you in front
of the Secretary of State.

14:09.491 --> 14:11.332
- Excuse me?
- Sugar beets

14:11.442 --> 14:14.524
are the seventh-largest crop in Idaho.

14:14.525 --> 14:16.393
You know what the sixth is, Elizabeth?

14:16.394 --> 14:17.694
No.

14:17.695 --> 14:20.130
Marijuana. Which is still

14:20.131 --> 14:22.099
illegal in Idaho, as I recall.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.968
- Russell...
- And unless you want the DEA doing flyovers

14:24.969 --> 14:27.838
of every farm from Boise
to Coeur d'Alene,

14:27.839 --> 14:29.706
you will give the president

14:29.707 --> 14:31.942
your support on this issue.

14:31.943 --> 14:34.943
You know we do all we can to
crack down on the pot growing.

14:34.944 --> 14:35.912
Do I?

14:35.913 --> 14:38.248
'Cause the press release is gonna say

14:38.249 --> 14:39.749
the federal government had to step in

14:39.750 --> 14:41.618
'cause the state and local authorities

14:41.619 --> 14:44.921
weren't doing their job.

14:44.922 --> 14:47.491
I know you got an election coming up.

14:47.492 --> 14:50.026
Tight race, by the looks of it.

14:50.027 --> 14:52.395
Well...

14:52.396 --> 14:54.664
got to hit the hay if I'm gonna be up

14:54.665 --> 14:58.368
bright and early to vote
to lift the embargo.

14:58.369 --> 15:02.005
Russell, I'd have you
take care of my bill,

15:02.006 --> 15:05.140
but that might look like
you were buying my vote.

15:08.445 --> 15:09.979
Madam.

15:13.150 --> 15:15.217
(exhales)

15:16.486 --> 15:19.356
Cuba and the United States

15:19.357 --> 15:22.592
end 54 years of hostility

15:22.593 --> 15:25.996
on President Dalton's watch.

15:25.997 --> 15:29.599
I can see the campaign commercial.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.034
Champagne,

15:31.035 --> 15:33.470
- to celebrate?
- BARTENDER: Coming right up.

15:33.471 --> 15:35.639
W-What's one of our yeses

15:35.640 --> 15:38.441
doing holding a press conference?

15:38.442 --> 15:40.777
Can you turn that up, please?

15:40.778 --> 15:41.811
BARTENDER: Yes, ma'am.

15:41.812 --> 15:45.115
...'77, Afeni Rahim was convicted

15:45.116 --> 15:47.184
of the brutal and cold-blooded murder

15:47.185 --> 15:50.654
of Chicago PD officer John Burke.

15:50.655 --> 15:51.855
She then escaped custody

15:51.856 --> 15:54.891
and fled to Cuba, where she has lived

15:54.892 --> 15:57.460
for the last 38 years.

15:57.461 --> 15:59.495
Mrs. Burke?

16:01.164 --> 16:03.465
(camera shutter clicking)

16:07.237 --> 16:10.540
My husband was cruelly taken from me

16:10.541 --> 16:12.943
and from his three little girls

16:12.944 --> 16:15.244
nearly 40 years ago.

16:18.315 --> 16:21.251
I would be doing a
disservice to his memory

16:21.252 --> 16:23.653
if I did not continue the fight

16:23.654 --> 16:26.723
to bring his killer to justice.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.125
PARISI: Which is why
I stand here tonight:

16:29.126 --> 16:31.695
to say, in front of
this historic building,

16:31.696 --> 16:35.632
that I will not vote to
lift the embargo on Cuba

16:35.633 --> 16:38.435
unless the Cuban government
returns Afeni Rahim

16:38.436 --> 16:42.204
to U.S. custody. Thank you.

16:44.407 --> 16:46.675
(sighs)

16:55.140 --> 16:58.965
Afeni Rahim was born
Lisa Johnston in 1949

16:58.966 --> 17:00.800
to Karen and Davis Johnston.

17:00.801 --> 17:02.335
She was on full scholarship

17:02.336 --> 17:05.237
at the University of Chicago,
where she was radicalized

17:05.238 --> 17:06.606
in the antiwar movement.

17:06.607 --> 17:08.107
She adopted the name Afeni Rahim

17:08.108 --> 17:09.608
after a brief stint with the Panthers,

17:09.609 --> 17:11.644
then fell in with the Black Action Army.

17:11.645 --> 17:14.480
From the mid-to-late '70s the
group grew increasingly radical.

17:14.481 --> 17:16.482
They were believed to be
behind three bank robberies

17:16.483 --> 17:18.284
before the shootout
that got her arrested.

17:18.285 --> 17:19.986
How did she end up in Cuba?

17:19.987 --> 17:21.954
After her conviction and sentencing,

17:21.954 --> 17:24.190
she escaped from the courthouse restroom.

17:24.191 --> 17:26.525
Six months later she turns up in Havana.

17:26.526 --> 17:28.361
The Cubans view her as a hero

17:28.362 --> 17:29.996
of the worldwide proletariat struggle.

17:29.997 --> 17:31.664
We're gonna need a pretty big carrot

17:31.665 --> 17:33.199
to get Cuba to cough her up.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.334
Contact Justice, Treasury, Commerce...

17:35.335 --> 17:37.937
see if anyone has something that
we can use as an inducement.

17:37.938 --> 17:39.038
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:39.039 --> 17:40.777
You're gonna be pretty
much alone up here.

17:40.778 --> 17:41.985
Keep our coalition together.

17:41.986 --> 17:42.942
- No problem.
- If any

17:42.943 --> 17:44.577
of our yeses start to waver,

17:44.578 --> 17:46.012
don't hesitate to call me.

17:46.013 --> 17:47.079
- Yes, ma'am.
- HENRY: Let's go.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.047
Just let me know how it's going.

17:48.048 --> 17:49.248
- Safe travels.
- Thank you.

17:49.249 --> 17:51.017
- Bye, Henry.
- Bye, Nadine.

17:51.018 --> 17:53.653
ALISON: Okay, Cuba trivia:

17:53.654 --> 17:55.187
Did you guys know that Ernest Hemingway

17:55.188 --> 17:56.722
<i>wrote The Old Man and the Sea in Cuba?</i>

17:56.723 --> 17:58.691
- BOTH: Yep.
- And...

17:58.692 --> 18:00.960
that he donated his Nobel
Prize to a Cuban church?

18:00.961 --> 18:03.062
- BOTH: Yep.
- And...

18:03.063 --> 18:05.631
in 1492, Christopher
Columbus claimed the island

18:05.632 --> 18:07.158
for the kingdom of Spain and named it...

18:07.159 --> 18:08.300
<i>- Isla Juana.
- Yep.</i>

18:08.301 --> 18:10.970
Is there anything you guys don't know?

18:10.971 --> 18:12.438
Well, that depends.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.373
Are there any car accidents
we don't know about?

18:14.374 --> 18:17.809
- Dad. - I'm sorry, you just
set me up for that one.

18:19.645 --> 18:22.314
I know you're catching a plane,
you mind if I ride with you?

18:22.315 --> 18:23.849
- Oh.
- No, no. Come, uh, you know

18:23.850 --> 18:26.052
- our daughter Alison.
- Come in, Russell, hi.

18:26.053 --> 18:29.255
- Hi.
- Of course. Can we talk?

18:29.256 --> 18:32.825
- Yeah. Why don't you listen to some
music, sweetie? - I'm not here.

18:32.826 --> 18:35.695
<i>JACKSON: The president's not happy</i>

18:35.696 --> 18:37.930
<i>about the Afeni Rahim situation.</i>

18:37.931 --> 18:39.498
Cuba's supposed to be legacy-making.

18:39.499 --> 18:41.200
Rahim's a distraction.

18:41.201 --> 18:43.636
Plus it means Sterling was right

18:43.637 --> 18:45.237
about this being a bad idea.

18:45.238 --> 18:46.772
Maybe Sterling's behind this.

18:46.773 --> 18:47.907
You're not here, remember?

18:47.908 --> 18:51.477
- Oh, I'm just saying...
- W-Why would Parisi

18:51.478 --> 18:53.412
publicly challenge a
president in his own party?

18:53.413 --> 18:54.714
What's in it for him?

18:54.715 --> 18:57.450
A chance to get Afeni
Rahim back, right a wrong

18:57.451 --> 18:59.118
done to one of his constituents?

18:59.119 --> 19:01.153
He mispronounced her name
at the press conference.

19:01.154 --> 19:04.123
I guarantee he'd never
heard of her till yesterday.

19:04.124 --> 19:06.992
And you're suggesting Craig Sterling

19:06.993 --> 19:08.828
found the officer's family

19:08.829 --> 19:12.364
and somehow convinced Parisi to go public

19:12.365 --> 19:15.601
with the demand for Rahim,
all to settle a score with us?

19:15.602 --> 19:16.736
He's a politician.

19:16.737 --> 19:18.170
He didn't want the policy.

19:18.171 --> 19:19.138
Sounds paranoid.

19:19.139 --> 19:20.639
Well, people lie all the time.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.775
Oh, my God, Dad, stop.

19:22.776 --> 19:24.376
- What?
- Hey, you're not supposed to be listening.

19:24.377 --> 19:26.643
- Yeah, but he wanted me to hear that.
- Now you're being paranoid.

19:26.644 --> 19:29.348
I seem to be in the middle
of a family argument.

19:29.349 --> 19:32.318
Stop the car. I'm getting out.

19:32.319 --> 19:34.819
Just get the Cubans to hand over Rahim.

19:36.922 --> 19:39.190
(low, indistinct conversations)

19:43.763 --> 19:47.166
Hey, I'm looking for Joseph Hoffman.

19:47.167 --> 19:49.534
- Right there.
- Thank you.

19:54.273 --> 19:55.875
Excuse me, Mr. Hoffman.

19:55.876 --> 19:57.643
I'm Matt Mahoney from
the State Department.

19:57.644 --> 19:59.211
We spoke earlier this morning?

19:59.212 --> 20:01.247
This thing really happening?

20:01.248 --> 20:03.282
Oh, the embassy reopening?

20:03.283 --> 20:05.317
Yeah, it's really happening.

20:05.318 --> 20:07.486
And you're looking for guys
who were stationed there

20:07.487 --> 20:09.855
when we left back in '61?

20:09.856 --> 20:12.024
Yes.

20:12.025 --> 20:13.826
Bunch of old geezers.

20:13.827 --> 20:17.363
Sir, you're currently lifting

20:17.364 --> 20:19.365
more than I can.

20:19.366 --> 20:22.201
I'd hardly call you an old geezer.

20:22.202 --> 20:25.237
(chuckles)

20:25.238 --> 20:27.173
How can I help you,

20:27.174 --> 20:30.341
Matt Mahoney from the State Department?

20:31.944 --> 20:34.079
<i>BARZAN: I regret that you
weren't able to attend</i>

20:34.080 --> 20:35.748
our flag-raising in Washington.

20:35.749 --> 20:37.049
It was beautiful.

20:37.050 --> 20:38.818
Truly inspired beginning.

20:38.819 --> 20:40.719
Really? Because I heard
it was just another

20:40.720 --> 20:43.589
rehashing of Cuban propaganda.

20:43.590 --> 20:47.560
Spoken like a true imperialist Yanqui.

20:47.561 --> 20:50.663
May I present the Minister
of Education, Gladys Castillo.

20:50.664 --> 20:52.331
Oh, nice to meet you.

20:52.332 --> 20:56.001
The Minister of Finance, Hector Varga.

20:56.002 --> 20:58.504
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

20:58.505 --> 21:01.707
The Minister of Sugar, Gustavo Rodrigues.

21:01.708 --> 21:03.375
It's a pleasure to meet you.

21:03.376 --> 21:06.645
The Associate Minister
of Sugar, Adolfo Menas.

21:06.646 --> 21:10.015
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Uh, ma'am?

21:10.016 --> 21:11.283
Just got off the phone with Justice...

21:11.284 --> 21:12.651
they approve the inducements.

21:12.652 --> 21:15.988
Manuel, I-I need to meet

21:15.989 --> 21:18.257
with your first vice president.

21:18.258 --> 21:19.658
He's a very busy man.

21:19.659 --> 21:21.060
It's about the embargo.

21:21.061 --> 21:23.963
Did you get your hotheaded
senator to back down?

21:23.964 --> 21:26.564
Not yet, but I think I might be able to.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.569
By asking us to give up Comrade Rahim?

21:30.570 --> 21:34.672
If this is your intention,
I cannot arrange a meeting.

21:36.175 --> 21:38.577
I've got this thing with my speechwriter.

21:38.578 --> 21:40.779
I don't usually like his first draft.

21:40.780 --> 21:43.616
Or his second. But I love his third.

21:43.617 --> 21:45.409
So I've just started telling him

21:45.410 --> 21:47.486
to start with the third draft, you know?

21:47.487 --> 21:49.235
- Madam Secretary...
- I know you're wondering where

21:49.236 --> 21:50.768
I'm going with this. Just...

21:50.769 --> 21:52.870
After six months of
dealing with each other,

21:52.871 --> 21:54.238
you and I have a pattern.

21:54.239 --> 21:56.874
You say no, I strategize
with my team, come back

21:56.875 --> 21:58.509
with a different approach.
And in that time

21:58.510 --> 22:00.211
you've done the same
thing and we're closer.

22:00.212 --> 22:03.981
After a few rounds of this,
what was once impossible

22:03.982 --> 22:06.350
is suddenly doable, but I
don't have that kind of time.

22:06.351 --> 22:08.018
So let's just skip the first two rounds

22:08.019 --> 22:10.520
and get me in to see
your first vice president.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.258
I'll see what I can do.

22:14.259 --> 22:16.293
- Great.
- In the meantime...

22:16.294 --> 22:18.662
The Minister of Coal and Mining.

22:18.663 --> 22:20.331
HENRY: Check it out, Noodle.

22:20.332 --> 22:21.999
That is our ride today.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.701
- (gasps)
- A 1955 Chevy Bel Air convertible.

22:23.702 --> 22:25.536
Oh, my God, that is way cool!

22:25.537 --> 22:27.171
They haven't had American imports in Cuba

22:27.172 --> 22:28.572
since the revolution so they got

22:28.573 --> 22:30.474
to take really good care of those babies.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.176
Like, if they get in a car accident,

22:32.177 --> 22:34.445
- they don't have the parts to fix this.
- Dad!

22:34.446 --> 22:36.380
What? I wasn't referring
to your accident.

22:36.381 --> 22:38.249
- Really. I was just making conversation.
- Sure.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.851
<i>- Gracias, senor.
- Anyway, where are we going?</i>

22:40.852 --> 22:42.820
Okay, here's the best part.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.122
Cuba's a communist country, right,

22:45.123 --> 22:46.690
so they don't allow religion.

22:46.691 --> 22:48.092
But despite that,

22:48.093 --> 22:50.094
these beautiful churches have survived.

22:50.095 --> 22:51.829
We're touring churches?

22:51.830 --> 22:53.831
Yeah, like we did in
England. Remember that?

22:53.832 --> 22:55.733
- Yeah.
- Well, that was pretty fun.

22:55.734 --> 22:57.835
Yeah.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.387
Honey, if you want to do
something else, we can...

23:00.388 --> 23:01.305
No, it's fine.

23:01.306 --> 23:03.374
I just thought you'd be
more excited 'cause we had

23:03.375 --> 23:04.842
- such a good...
- I totally am.

23:04.843 --> 23:06.243
Okay. So... let's go?

23:06.244 --> 23:07.645
Yes. And I'm gonna drive, 'cause...

23:07.646 --> 23:10.581
And that was a reference to
your accident, by the way.

23:10.582 --> 23:12.348
I know.

23:14.018 --> 23:17.888
Mr. Vice President, thank you
you for agreeing to see me on

23:17.889 --> 23:19.924
such short notice.

23:19.925 --> 23:22.493
Manuel tells me

23:22.494 --> 23:25.362
<i>that you wish to amend our agreement?</i>

23:25.363 --> 23:27.531
Why does that not surprise me?

23:27.532 --> 23:29.667
(laughs)

23:29.668 --> 23:33.137
We have an opportunity today

23:33.138 --> 23:36.740
to not just reopen our
embassy in Havana,

23:36.741 --> 23:38.642
but to lift the embargo

23:38.643 --> 23:41.879
and end decades of distrust
between our two countries.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.115
And what will remove the American boot

23:45.116 --> 23:47.450
from the throat of the Cuban people?

23:49.220 --> 23:51.288
Afeni Rahim.

23:51.289 --> 23:54.959
So the rumors were true.

23:54.960 --> 23:58.362
Manuel's generation makes
a compelling argument:

23:58.363 --> 23:59.663
trust the Yanquis.

23:59.664 --> 24:01.498
We must have peace

24:01.499 --> 24:04.768
so we can build an economy
and help our people.

24:04.769 --> 24:06.971
But they weren't alive

24:06.972 --> 24:11.041
during the Invasión de Playa Girón.

24:11.042 --> 24:13.010
I was there.

24:13.011 --> 24:15.579
I witnessed firsthand Yanqui treachery.

24:15.580 --> 24:18.148
And now, here you are,

24:18.149 --> 24:20.117
true to your nature,

24:20.118 --> 24:22.853
trying to get us to
bargain away our honor.

24:22.854 --> 24:26.957
We currently have three Cuban nationals

24:26.958 --> 24:28.158
in our federal prison.

24:28.159 --> 24:29.960
We're proposing a simple swap.

24:29.961 --> 24:32.896
These three spies for Ms. Rahim.

24:32.897 --> 24:37.101
My dear Madam Secretary,
there's nothing simple in this.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.436
The men you just spoke of are soldiers.

24:39.437 --> 24:43.307
They knew the risks when
they accepted their mission.

24:43.308 --> 24:45.609
Afeni Rahim, on the other hand,

24:45.610 --> 24:48.145
is a hero of the people

24:48.146 --> 24:51.148
who came to these shores for refuge.

24:51.149 --> 24:52.583
BARZAN: General?

24:52.584 --> 24:54.218
<i>Por favor.</i>

24:54.219 --> 24:56.654
Manuel, I know you worked very hard

24:56.655 --> 24:58.522
on this agreement.

24:58.523 --> 25:00.457
But what kind of
revolutionaries would we be

25:00.458 --> 25:04.427
if we sold out our friends
for a few pieces of silver?

25:17.579 --> 25:20.410
The current regime has
instituted changes which allow

25:20.411 --> 25:23.250
self-employed people to legally
run their own businesses.

25:23.251 --> 25:25.761
Manuel, I think we'd like to
go back to the hotel, please?

25:25.762 --> 25:26.653
I bet you didn't know

25:26.654 --> 25:29.956
that we have 201 legal
self-employment categories.

25:29.957 --> 25:32.092
For instance, number 35...
restaurant owner.

25:32.093 --> 25:33.727
Manuel, please.

25:33.728 --> 25:35.462
This small restaurant, or paladar,

25:35.463 --> 25:37.197
as we call them, is very popular.

25:37.198 --> 25:39.799
I thought you might like
to try some local cuisine.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.201
Uh, it's been a tough morning,

25:41.202 --> 25:43.336
and Secretary McCord doesn't
have much of an appetite.

25:43.337 --> 25:44.537
No, my dear.

25:44.538 --> 25:47.974
What's on the agenda is a
speech where I tell you

25:47.975 --> 25:49.409
that Cuba is thriving with new changes.

25:49.410 --> 25:51.344
But that's a lie.

25:51.345 --> 25:52.912
The average Cuban cannot survive

25:52.913 --> 25:54.814
on the rations provided
by the government.

25:54.815 --> 25:57.684
I love my country, Madam Secretary.

25:57.685 --> 25:59.753
And I want to see it thrive,

25:59.754 --> 26:02.856
but that is not possible
until the American embargo

26:02.857 --> 26:05.191
is once and forever lifted.

26:05.192 --> 26:07.360
Now, my country may never hand over

26:07.361 --> 26:09.562
Afeni Rahim,

26:09.563 --> 26:12.999
but perhaps Comrade Rahim
could be convinced

26:13.000 --> 26:15.335
to return to America of her own free will.

26:15.336 --> 26:17.203
I-I don't understand.

26:17.204 --> 26:22.942
This paladar is owned by none other than

26:22.943 --> 26:24.577
Afeni Rahim.

26:24.578 --> 26:26.845
And that is her.

26:31.017 --> 26:33.285
I trust you have built up an appetite?

26:43.696 --> 26:45.964
It's so graphic.

26:49.369 --> 26:52.337
It's finding light in the darkness.

26:54.007 --> 26:56.009
Mom told me about your student.

26:56.010 --> 26:58.812
She said it's been hard for you.

26:58.813 --> 27:00.780
I'm fine.

27:00.781 --> 27:03.081
Whatever.

27:07.087 --> 27:09.522
- Hey, what are doing?
- What?

27:09.523 --> 27:11.825
- Give me that thing. - To Instagram
when we get back to civilization.

27:11.826 --> 27:13.793
Come here. Do you have any idea

27:13.794 --> 27:16.563
how hard these people have had
to work to preserve this?

27:16.564 --> 27:18.698
And you have the audacity
to belittle their beliefs.

27:18.699 --> 27:21.334
<i>- You have the audacity to...
- How am I belittling anyone's beliefs?</i>

27:21.335 --> 27:23.269
I'm taking the picture
because it's beautiful.

27:23.270 --> 27:24.771
You're taking it to get "likes."

27:24.772 --> 27:26.606
You're becoming someone
who I don't even know.

27:26.607 --> 27:28.842
Then maybe you should get to know me.

27:28.843 --> 27:31.276
I'll be in the car.

27:32.345 --> 27:34.447
Afeni Rahim.

27:34.448 --> 27:36.382
It's a pleasure to meet you.

27:36.383 --> 27:37.650
I'm Secretary...

27:37.651 --> 27:39.285
Of State Elizabeth McCord.

27:39.286 --> 27:41.923
I'm aware, and you're here

27:41.924 --> 27:44.426
because my revolutionary brothers

27:44.427 --> 27:46.628
in Havana told your government

27:46.629 --> 27:48.463
to stick it where the sun don't shine.

27:48.464 --> 27:51.233
Something like that, yeah.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.268
Can I have a moment of your time?

27:53.269 --> 27:55.203
White folks are always taking my time.

27:55.204 --> 27:56.872
I have an opportunity

27:56.873 --> 28:00.675
to lift the U.S. embargo,
but I need your help.

28:00.676 --> 28:01.877
There are people

28:01.878 --> 28:04.045
who want you to come back to the U.S.

28:04.046 --> 28:05.247
to serve your sentence.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.182
What if I could ensure

28:07.183 --> 28:09.618
that you would be at a
minimum-security prison

28:09.619 --> 28:11.520
close to your daughter in Connecticut?

28:11.521 --> 28:13.255
You have a grandson you haven't met.

28:13.256 --> 28:16.224
And you would be eligible
for parole in three years.

28:16.225 --> 28:18.894
Wouldn't that be convenient for you?

28:18.895 --> 28:22.030
<i>I simply turn myself over to the Feds,</i>

28:22.031 --> 28:23.799
and you get whatever it is you want.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.801
Not just me.

28:25.802 --> 28:28.170
Don't you think you owe
the Cuban people something

28:28.171 --> 28:29.871
for taking you in?

28:29.872 --> 28:32.507
You could singlehandedly
improve their lives.

28:32.508 --> 28:35.377
The shooting of Officer Burke?

28:35.378 --> 28:37.913
The Chicago cops and the FBI

28:37.914 --> 28:40.148
had targeted us, declared us

28:40.149 --> 28:42.217
enemies of the State.

28:42.218 --> 28:45.520
They killed my friends, wounded me,

28:45.521 --> 28:47.422
arrested me, planted evidence,

28:47.423 --> 28:49.224
intimidated witnesses.

28:49.225 --> 28:53.161
<i>I did not shoot that cop.</i>

28:53.162 --> 28:55.163
Never even raised my gun.

28:55.164 --> 28:57.265
I'm sorry

28:57.266 --> 28:59.234
that he died,

28:59.235 --> 29:03.004
but two of my comrades died, too,

29:03.005 --> 29:06.840
and nobody is talking about that.

29:07.676 --> 29:09.978
He pulled his gun first.

29:09.979 --> 29:12.747
We weren't looking for trouble,

29:12.748 --> 29:15.250
but that has never stopped a cop

29:15.251 --> 29:17.552
from shooting black folks on sight.

29:17.553 --> 29:19.154
DAISY: The all-white jury

29:19.155 --> 29:20.856
that sentenced you only took 30 minutes

29:20.857 --> 29:22.157
to give you life in prison.

29:22.158 --> 29:23.825
- That wouldn't happen today.
- We might have

29:23.826 --> 29:26.361
terrible Internet, but we get news.

29:26.362 --> 29:28.797
So you tell me... was it different

29:28.798 --> 29:32.067
for Trayvon Martin, or Eric Garner?

29:32.068 --> 29:34.002
Is it any different

29:34.003 --> 29:37.072
in Ferguson, Missouri, or
Charleston, South Carolina?

29:37.073 --> 29:38.907
No?

29:38.908 --> 29:41.308
I didn't think so.

29:44.312 --> 29:46.715
I need all FBI records pertaining

29:46.716 --> 29:51.253
to the arrest and trial of
Afeni Rahim in Chicago, 1977.

29:51.254 --> 29:52.721
Like I told your office,

29:52.722 --> 29:55.891
you need to fill out the FOIA request.

29:55.892 --> 29:58.360
You'll hear something
in the next three months.

29:58.361 --> 30:01.496
Three months? Do you know
what'll happen in three months?

30:01.497 --> 30:03.932
Senator Koester from Missouri will realize

30:03.933 --> 30:05.500
that the Arch is dirty,

30:05.501 --> 30:07.369
and he'll want money to clean it,

30:07.370 --> 30:09.938
but that money was already
promised to Senator Tilden,

30:09.939 --> 30:12.207
and if we lose Tilden, we lose Moorehouse

30:12.208 --> 30:13.775
for reasons I don't understand.

30:13.776 --> 30:15.577
So, would you please

30:15.578 --> 30:17.212
get me those records?!

30:17.213 --> 30:20.549
Like I said, you fill out the
form, then we can proc...

30:20.550 --> 30:23.418
(crying)

30:23.419 --> 30:26.821
Okay, tell you what.

30:26.822 --> 30:29.991
Maybe I can expedite
those files for you.

30:29.992 --> 30:32.227
Oh! Thank you.

30:32.228 --> 30:35.297
I'm sorry. I'm...

30:35.298 --> 30:37.332
(whimpers)

30:37.333 --> 30:38.599
(sighs)

30:43.905 --> 30:47.875
(quietly): Blake, yeah, tell
the secretary I got the files.

30:50.612 --> 30:52.814
(water spritzing)

30:52.815 --> 30:55.183
- Mrs. Thomas?
- Uh?

30:55.184 --> 30:58.086
Matt Mahoney. Uh, we spoke
earlier on the phone?

30:58.087 --> 30:59.588
Of course!

30:59.589 --> 31:02.824
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

31:02.825 --> 31:04.993
Oh. Bill is inside.

31:04.994 --> 31:06.928
He's been so excited.

31:06.929 --> 31:08.863
Bill?

31:08.864 --> 31:11.466
Mr. Thomas, it's-it's an honor.

31:11.467 --> 31:13.635
My old Marine uniform.

31:13.636 --> 31:15.036
- Oh, yeah.
- What do you think?

31:15.037 --> 31:17.939
MRS. THOMAS: I think I
should let out the pants.

31:17.940 --> 31:19.441
(laughter)

31:19.442 --> 31:21.977
It looks... You look great.

31:21.978 --> 31:24.012
Please sit down.

31:24.013 --> 31:25.580
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Oh.

31:25.581 --> 31:28.717
Last time I had this on was
the day we left Cuba in '61.

31:28.718 --> 31:30.952
- Oh, what was that like?
- The day we left?

31:30.953 --> 31:32.487
It must have been a madhouse.

31:32.488 --> 31:35.090
Oh, it was, but not for
the reasons you'd expect.

31:35.091 --> 31:36.825
There was quite a crowd gathering,

31:36.826 --> 31:39.427
so the Cubans sent a company
of militia to protect us.

31:39.428 --> 31:43.732
But the crowd wasn't violent
at all. They wanted visas.

31:43.733 --> 31:45.667
No one wanted to be left behind.

31:45.668 --> 31:48.269
We closed the embassy January 3, 1961,

31:48.270 --> 31:50.939
and we sailed out of the
harbor that same night.

31:50.940 --> 31:52.874
Many of us had been there for years.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.042
Our lives were there.

31:54.043 --> 31:57.078
We fell in love with
the country, the people.

31:57.079 --> 31:59.347
- I met the love of my life there.
- Oh.

31:59.348 --> 32:02.150
I thought, a couple of years,

32:02.151 --> 32:04.853
Castro would be gone, we'd be back.

32:04.854 --> 32:07.122
But it's been 54 years,

32:07.123 --> 32:10.824
and we haven't set foot
in Cuba since that day.

32:14.329 --> 32:17.831
Well, that is about to change, sir.

32:35.850 --> 32:37.786
His name was Ivan Kolashkov.

32:37.787 --> 32:40.053
He was my student.

32:41.156 --> 32:43.224
And he killed himself.

32:43.225 --> 32:45.560
And I'm still...

32:45.561 --> 32:49.263
dealing with his death.

32:49.998 --> 32:52.067
He was only 26.

32:52.068 --> 32:55.036
And I know you think that
makes him an adult, but...

32:55.037 --> 32:57.439
it doesn't. He was just a kid.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.407
He was smart, driven.

32:59.408 --> 33:02.477
Stubborn... like you.

33:02.478 --> 33:05.113
And gay... and hiding it from everybody,

33:05.114 --> 33:06.781
including his parents and his friends.

33:06.782 --> 33:08.817
- Wow.
- Yeah.

33:08.818 --> 33:10.652
It's not your fault he killed himself.

33:10.653 --> 33:12.187
You were just his teacher.

33:12.188 --> 33:14.723
I'm having a tough time with this.

33:14.724 --> 33:17.459
I haven't been sleeping well.

33:17.460 --> 33:19.260
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been watching

33:19.261 --> 33:22.063
<i>a lot of Gunsmoke in the
middle of the night.</i>

33:22.064 --> 33:24.364
<i>What's Gunsmoke?</i>

33:25.333 --> 33:26.935
(chuckles): It's... an old TV show.

33:26.936 --> 33:28.103
It's a Western.

33:28.104 --> 33:29.971
I liked it when I was a kid.

33:29.972 --> 33:32.240
It's weird to think of you as a kid.

33:32.241 --> 33:34.608
Well, it's weird to think
of you as an adult.

33:36.311 --> 33:38.713
I should have told you about the car.

33:38.714 --> 33:40.014
I understand you wanting

33:40.015 --> 33:42.550
to fix the car... you want to grow up,

33:42.551 --> 33:43.885
you want to have more responsibility...

33:43.886 --> 33:45.520
but...

33:45.521 --> 33:48.123
(softly): don't be in such a rush.

33:48.124 --> 33:50.658
Once you grow up, things
get really complicated.

33:50.659 --> 33:53.428
Today I just wanted to go back
in time to our trip to England

33:53.429 --> 33:54.863
when touring churches was our thing.

33:54.864 --> 33:57.799
<i>You should wake me up the
next time you watch Gunsmoke.</i>

33:57.800 --> 33:59.501
<i>Maybe that can be our thing.</i>

33:59.502 --> 34:01.736
(chuckles): Okay.

34:01.737 --> 34:04.171
So, where to now?

34:05.273 --> 34:07.175
Mm...

34:07.176 --> 34:08.676
it's up to you.

34:08.677 --> 34:10.145
No way!

34:10.146 --> 34:11.880
You're drivin'.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.282
- Just don't kill me, cause if you do
- Oh... (gasps)

34:14.283 --> 34:17.652
<i>- your mother will kill you.
- How do you turn this thing on, Dad?</i>

34:17.652 --> 34:19.587
Afeni.

34:19.588 --> 34:22.123
I thought I made myself clear.

34:22.123 --> 34:25.826
♪

34:26.960 --> 34:29.731
What she wants more than
anything is a soapbox.

34:29.732 --> 34:31.666
This isn't only about
justice for herself.

34:31.667 --> 34:34.101
It's bigger than that, and she knows it.

34:34.103 --> 34:36.803
Remind her that she's a revolutionary.

34:39.507 --> 34:41.708
Under COINTELPRO,

34:41.710 --> 34:44.679
the FBI wiretapped your defense team

34:44.679 --> 34:46.514
and they suppressed forensic evidence

34:46.514 --> 34:49.016
that made it clear you didn't fire

34:49.018 --> 34:50.251
the murder weapon.

34:50.252 --> 34:51.553
Afeni,

34:51.554 --> 34:53.755
based on these findings,
Attorney General Cronenberg

34:53.755 --> 34:55.590
is offering you a new trial.

34:55.591 --> 34:59.394
And we will make sure that these files

34:59.395 --> 35:01.729
are splashed across every newspaper

35:01.730 --> 35:02.864
in the country.

35:02.865 --> 35:04.632
DAISY: You're right... there are

35:04.633 --> 35:07.335
a lot of things that haven't
changed since your revolution.

35:07.336 --> 35:09.804
But if you hope to make
any difference now,

35:09.805 --> 35:12.407
it won't be here in this restaurant.

35:12.408 --> 35:15.577
Come back to the States,
face a jury of your peers,

35:15.578 --> 35:18.679
and you'll have the eyes and
ears of the entire nation.

35:30.509 --> 35:33.777
(seabirds squawking in distance)

35:34.612 --> 35:37.915
Our diplomats will be more effective

35:37.916 --> 35:41.586
<i>in responding to American
citizens who need help</i>

35:41.587 --> 35:43.521
<i>or when responding</i>

35:43.522 --> 35:46.824
- to American citizens who need help?
- HENRY: When.

35:46.825 --> 35:49.627
But, see, I think "in" is better.

35:49.628 --> 35:51.195
You're right.

35:51.196 --> 35:53.264
"When" implies American citizens

35:53.265 --> 35:55.600
will need help.

35:55.601 --> 35:58.002
But "in" is so...

35:58.003 --> 35:59.304
noncommittal.

35:59.305 --> 36:02.106
Do you think that "in" is
noncommittal, like...?

36:02.107 --> 36:04.142
I'm gonna stay noncommittal on that.

36:04.143 --> 36:05.942
(chuckles)

36:06.778 --> 36:08.513
"When" is better.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.615
You're right. Thank you.

36:10.616 --> 36:12.483
- Your speech is perfect.
- (sighs)

36:12.484 --> 36:14.886
And so are you. Here.

36:14.887 --> 36:16.187
What is this?

36:16.188 --> 36:18.036
Alison and I cut our church tour short,

36:18.037 --> 36:20.358
stopped at an outdoor flea
market... she picked it out.

36:20.359 --> 36:23.227
Oh! It's beautiful!

36:23.228 --> 36:26.864
She suggested that...
you could wear it today

36:26.865 --> 36:30.367
as a symbol of Cuba's
nascent entrepreneurship.

36:31.302 --> 36:33.571
She said "nascent"?

36:33.572 --> 36:34.639
Oh.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.708
Maybe it's an SAT word.

36:36.709 --> 36:38.176
I don't know.

36:38.177 --> 36:40.278
I think we underestimate her.

36:40.279 --> 36:41.813
Maybe.

36:41.814 --> 36:43.514
How do I look?

36:43.515 --> 36:46.284
Like you're ready to make some history.

36:46.285 --> 36:47.752
But do I look hot?

36:47.753 --> 36:49.787
- Hot as could be.
- (laughs)

36:49.788 --> 36:51.823
Thank you...

36:51.824 --> 36:54.859
for your hard work returning a
dangerous fugitive to face justice.

36:54.860 --> 36:56.861
Yeah, I wish you'd come to me first

36:56.862 --> 36:59.097
before going public...
we could work something out.

36:59.098 --> 37:01.833
I will keep that in mind in the future.

37:01.834 --> 37:03.701
You don't have a future.

37:03.702 --> 37:06.270
At least not with this administration.

37:06.271 --> 37:10.208
An administration that still
controls the party purse strings.

37:10.209 --> 37:12.310
So that reelection campaign
you got coming up...

37:12.311 --> 37:15.312
you're gonna be out there on your own.

37:16.381 --> 37:19.584
The president doesn't appreciate
being publicly strong-armed,

37:19.585 --> 37:22.253
and neither do I.

37:22.254 --> 37:24.188
Nice talk.

37:24.189 --> 37:26.958
(pats back) See you in there.

37:26.959 --> 37:30.027
Afeni Rahim is in the air,
accompanied by federal marshals,

37:30.028 --> 37:32.230
the senate just approved
lifting the embargo,

37:32.231 --> 37:34.165
and the president will be signing the bill

37:34.166 --> 37:36.167
- as you're giving your speech.
- We actually pulled it off.

37:36.168 --> 37:38.403
Excellent work. And no surprises coming

37:38.404 --> 37:41.038
- out of left field.
- There is one.

37:41.039 --> 37:42.206
MATT: Madam Secretary,

37:42.207 --> 37:44.675
I'd like you to meet
Staff Sergeant Bill Thomas

37:44.676 --> 37:46.811
and PFC Joseph Hoffman.

37:46.812 --> 37:49.547
These were the two Marines
that lowered the American flag

37:49.548 --> 37:52.150
when the embassy closed in 1961.

37:52.151 --> 37:55.286
I thought they should be here
today when we raise it again.

37:55.287 --> 37:56.788
Gentlemen, it's an honor

37:56.789 --> 37:58.089
to meet you.

37:58.090 --> 37:59.724
I can't imagine two people

37:59.725 --> 38:01.325
I'd rather have here today.

38:01.326 --> 38:02.226
Happy to serve.

38:02.227 --> 38:04.461
Never thought I'd see this day.

38:05.296 --> 38:06.297
Gentlemen, if you'll follow me,

38:06.298 --> 38:07.697
I'll show you to your place.

38:11.202 --> 38:12.903
Nice work.

38:14.639 --> 38:16.407
In case you'd like to introduce them,

38:16.408 --> 38:18.008
I wrote a little something.

38:19.911 --> 38:22.979
It's my third draft.

38:23.714 --> 38:25.817
(Elizabeth laughing)

38:25.818 --> 38:30.755
Today the United States and
Cuba begin a new chapter.

38:30.756 --> 38:34.592
We may have different
views on many topics,

38:34.593 --> 38:37.962
but we need not feel
threatened by our differences.

38:37.963 --> 38:40.865
In the spirit of new beginnings,

38:40.866 --> 38:43.367
the U.S. Senate has just voted

38:43.368 --> 38:47.604
to lift the 54-year
trade embargo on Cuba.

38:48.806 --> 38:50.541
(man whoops)

38:50.542 --> 38:53.411
<i>This bold act by President Dalton</i>

38:53.412 --> 38:55.112
<i>should be a symbol</i>

38:55.113 --> 38:57.548
<i>to every Cuban...</i>

38:57.549 --> 39:01.118
<i>that the United States intends
to leave the past behind...</i>

39:01.119 --> 39:02.620
Good of you to be here.

39:02.621 --> 39:04.555
I know you weren't in favor of this.

39:04.556 --> 39:06.891
Come on, Russell, at the end of the day

39:06.892 --> 39:08.359
it's a win for the president,

39:08.360 --> 39:11.161
and that's all that really matters.

39:18.102 --> 39:19.170
(cameras clicking)

39:19.171 --> 39:20.737
(speaking inaudibly)

39:24.831 --> 39:25.889
<i>ELIZABETH: I stand here</i>

39:25.890 --> 39:28.558
not only because of the
visionary leadership

39:28.559 --> 39:32.329
of President Dalton and
his Cuban counterparts...

39:32.330 --> 39:33.797
but also because

39:33.798 --> 39:36.700
of the passion and
commitment of so many others

39:36.701 --> 39:38.268
who have given of themselves

39:38.269 --> 39:40.070
to make this happen.

39:40.071 --> 39:41.570
Today...

39:42.572 --> 39:46.643
...as we once again raise
our flag over the embassy,

39:46.644 --> 39:49.379
let's remember the day it was taken down,

39:49.380 --> 39:52.616
and the hardships that followed,

39:52.617 --> 39:56.720
and vow to keep alive the
promise of American ideals

39:56.721 --> 39:59.355
that this flag symbolizes.

40:00.157 --> 40:03.226
Freedom from oppression.

40:03.227 --> 40:06.530
Freedom of expression.

40:06.531 --> 40:09.566
And the hope for a bright future.

40:09.567 --> 40:11.901
Thank you.

41:10.594 --> 41:13.362
Still think this is a bad idea?

41:14.364 --> 41:19.102
CROWD (chanting): Free Afeni!
Free Afeni! Free Afeni!

41:19.103 --> 41:20.237
Mom...

41:20.238 --> 41:24.007
CROWD: Free Afeni! Free Afreni!

41:24.008 --> 41:26.775
(crowd continues chanting)

41:29.146 --> 41:30.981
(applause)

41:30.982 --> 41:33.850
I'd like to make a brief statement.

41:33.851 --> 41:36.218
♪

41:47.364 --> 41:49.432
I thought some good Cuban rum might be

41:49.433 --> 41:51.835
the perfect way to toast our victory.

41:51.836 --> 41:55.305
It is. Thank you. (chuckles)

41:55.306 --> 41:59.142
And nothing like a morning shot of rum.

41:59.143 --> 42:02.045
I was thinking later.

42:02.046 --> 42:03.914
Like when it's not...

42:03.915 --> 42:05.949
9:00 A.M.

42:05.950 --> 42:07.417
Drink up.

42:07.418 --> 42:09.184
You're gonna need it.

42:14.591 --> 42:15.892
Henry was right...

42:15.893 --> 42:18.261
about Sterling being
behind Parisi's attempt

42:18.262 --> 42:19.896
to scuttle Cuba.

42:19.897 --> 42:22.766
I noticed the two of them getting chummy

42:22.767 --> 42:24.534
at the signing ceremony, so I reached out

42:24.535 --> 42:26.403
to one of Parisi's staffers...

42:26.404 --> 42:29.906
who confirmed a call a few days ago...

42:29.907 --> 42:32.309
between Sterling and Parisi.

42:32.310 --> 42:34.110
Ten minutes later,

42:34.111 --> 42:38.148
Parisi mobilized his whole staff
to track down the cop's wife.

42:38.149 --> 42:39.649
But why?

42:39.650 --> 42:42.152
I mean...

42:42.153 --> 42:44.020
what could Sterling

42:44.021 --> 42:45.488
offer Parisi?

42:45.489 --> 42:48.792
Apparently, a cabinet post
in Dalton's second term.

42:48.793 --> 42:52.095
Sterling went behind the president's back

42:52.096 --> 42:54.164
and worked directly against him.

42:54.165 --> 42:55.999
If I were a paranoid man,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.735
I'd say Sterling wanted to
scuttle lifting the embargo

42:58.736 --> 43:00.904
not only 'cause he didn't believe in it,

43:00.905 --> 43:02.672
<i>but because we did,</i>

43:02.673 --> 43:04.574
<i>and Dalton listened to us.</i>

43:04.575 --> 43:06.009
He wants to be

43:06.010 --> 43:07.878
the only voice in the president's ear,

43:07.879 --> 43:09.913
so he tried to make us look bad.

43:09.914 --> 43:12.281
♪

43:17.254 --> 43:20.090
I don't think that's paranoid.

43:20.091 --> 43:22.391
(sets glass down)

43:25.495 --> 43:27.530
What do we do now?

43:27.531 --> 43:29.933
(laughs softly)

43:29.934 --> 43:31.934
We bury him.
