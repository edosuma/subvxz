WEBVTT

00:13.458 --> 00:14.750
PACEY?

00:16.792 --> 00:17.834
I THOUGHT THAT
WAS YOU OUT HERE.

00:17.834 --> 00:19.041
WERE YOU EVER
GOING TO COME IN?

00:19.041 --> 00:21.333
I FORGOT YOU GUYS
DON'T LOCK YOUR DOORS.

00:21.333 --> 00:23.834
YEAH, WELL,
ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO START NOW

00:23.834 --> 00:25.125
THAT I GOT ALL
THIS FILM EQUIPMENT
IN HERE.

00:25.125 --> 00:28.250
COME ON INSIDE.
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.625
YOU OK?

00:29.625 --> 00:32.208
YEAH.

00:32.208 --> 00:33.333
YEAH.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.750
I--I WENT OUT AFTER WORK
WITH A COUPLE OF GUYS.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.208
WE GOT A LITTLE CAVEMAN.

00:37.208 --> 00:38.708
AH.

00:38.708 --> 00:40.166
BUT I'D LOVE TO SEE
WHAT YOU GOT GOING.

00:49.834 --> 00:51.125
Pacey: WOW.

00:54.792 --> 00:57.959
IT'S PRETTY CRAZY, HUH?

00:57.959 --> 01:00.083
TOOK ME FOREVER.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.

01:01.583 --> 01:04.625
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
WHO'S SEEN IT.

01:08.083 --> 01:10.166
WELL, I WOULD SAY
THAT THIS OFFICIALLY

01:10.166 --> 01:12.125
MAKES YOU THE KING
OF PROCRASTINATION.

01:12.125 --> 01:14.583
NO, NO, NO. WE'RE GOING
TO SHOOT IN HERE.

01:14.583 --> 01:16.750
I KNOW IT'S TIGHT,
BUT I FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO MAKE THE CAMERA FIT.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.750
AND BY SAVING MONEY
ON LOCATIONS,

01:18.750 --> 01:20.291
WE CAN AFFORD TO GO
ALL OUT ON EVERYTHING ELSE.

01:20.291 --> 01:21.917
REALLY?
YEAH.

01:21.917 --> 01:23.375
I GOT 3 CREDIT CARDS
IN THE MAIL LAST WEEK,

01:23.375 --> 01:25.000
MAXED THEM OUT
IN, LIKE, A DAY.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.417
GOT LIGHTS, CAMERAS,
THIS AWESOME SOUND EQUIPMENT.

01:26.417 --> 01:30.583
I'M GOING COMPLETELY
OVERBOARD, BUT I DON'T CARE.

01:30.583 --> 01:34.375
I'M TALKING A MILE A MINUTE.
I HAVEN'T EVEN ASKED YOU
WHAT BROUGHT YOU TO CAPESIDE.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.750
(PACEY SIGHS)

01:41.750 --> 01:43.583
MAN. HA!

01:43.583 --> 01:46.625
BEING IN THIS ROOM,
IT JUST TAKES ME BACK
TO A WHOLE OTHER ERA.

01:46.625 --> 01:50.834
WHEN THE FUTURE
WAS A CLEAN SLATE
FOR ALL OF US, YOU KNOW?

01:50.834 --> 01:53.417
WELL, THE ROOM MAY HAVE
GONE BACK IN TIME,

01:53.417 --> 01:56.417
BUT I THINK
YOU AND I HAVE MOVED
AHEAD RATHER NICELY.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.250
IT'S ABOUT ALL THE OBSTACLES
WE WENT THROUGH
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.417
WE BOTH ENDED UP DOING
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED TO DO.

01:59.417 --> 02:01.625
WELL, THERE WAS THAT
BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME

02:01.625 --> 02:03.000
I TOYED WITH
THE IDEA OF BEING
A RODEO CLOWN,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.917
BUT I GUESS THIS'LL DO.
HEH HEH.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.291
BUT YOU MADE SOMETHING
OF YOURSELF, PACE,

02:07.291 --> 02:08.917
AND NOW YOU'RE MAKING
SOMETHING OUT OF ME.

02:08.917 --> 02:10.708
I--I DON'T KNOW THAT
YOU SHOULD GO THAT FAR.

02:10.708 --> 02:12.125
I MEAN, YOU HAD DONE
THIS BY YOURSELF. RIGHT?

02:12.125 --> 02:16.125
EVEN IF YOU HAD NOTHING,
THIS WOULD...

02:16.125 --> 02:17.834
I'M NOT...I'M SAY--
YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME, MAN.

02:17.834 --> 02:18.333
I'M...

02:21.375 --> 02:22.583
I'M TRYING TO THANK YOU.

02:22.583 --> 02:23.625
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME,
I GUESS, BUT, COME ON,

02:23.625 --> 02:26.291
DAWSON, I MEAN, WE ALL
KNEW YOU'D DO THIS.

02:26.291 --> 02:28.458
THIS WAS YOUR DREAM.
YOU JUST...

02:28.458 --> 02:29.041
NEEDED TO TAKE
A LITTLE TRIP DOWN
MEMORY LANE, RIGHT?

02:29.041 --> 02:31.125
YEAH, I NEEDED THAT

02:31.125 --> 02:33.750
AND A VERY FINANCIALLY SAVVY
ASSOCIATE PRODUCER.

02:35.041 --> 02:37.750
I'M GIVING YOU CREDIT
ON THE FILM.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.959
SO...

02:39.959 --> 02:41.375
YOU'RE PART OF THIS NOW.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.458
SO, WELCOME TO HOLLYWOOD,

02:45.458 --> 02:46.291
WHERE PEOPLE
HAVE MEANINGLESS TITLES

02:46.291 --> 02:49.458
FOR NOT EVEN
SHOWING UP ON SET.

02:49.458 --> 02:52.458
I'M SORRY. WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT?

02:57.166 --> 02:58.834
UH, IT WAS, UH...

02:58.834 --> 03:01.291
JUST, UH, AS YOUR
ASSOCIATE PRODUCER,

03:01.291 --> 03:05.667
I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS
ABOUT THE CASTING.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.083
PARTICULARLY
THE ROLE OF PACEY,

03:07.083 --> 03:10.000
WHICH I FEEL
HAS SOME FAIRLY
LARGE SHOES TO FILL.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.375
YOU'RE GOING TO LET
ALL THIS POWER GO STRAIGHT
TO YOUR HEAD, AREN'T YOU?

03:12.375 --> 03:15.166
YEAH, I GOT TO ENJOY IT
WHILE I CAN, RIGHT?

03:15.166 --> 03:18.000
LET ME SHOW YOU
THESE HEADSHOTS.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.125
I GOTTA TELL YA,
I DON'T THINK
THESE AMATEURS KNOW

03:19.125 --> 03:20.458
WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO.

03:22.458 --> 03:24.333
NO.

03:24.333 --> 03:25.291
SOMEBODY OUGHT
TO WARN 'EM.

04:15.708 --> 04:16.750
THANK YOU.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.583
(RINGS DOORBELL)

04:52.125 --> 04:54.583
DID YOU GET A HAIRCUT?

04:54.583 --> 04:57.458
UH...NO.

04:57.458 --> 04:58.625
5 INCHES OF BLOND
JUST FELL OFF.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.291
IT WAS REALLY
THE DAMNEDEST THING.

05:00.291 --> 05:02.959
IT'S--IT'S VERY FRENCH.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.208
UM, COME IN.
UH, THE CAB'S GONE,

05:05.208 --> 05:07.333
SO--SO ARE YOUR HOPES
OF LEAVING.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.208
JENNY, PLEASE.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.417
THANK YOU.

05:23.041 --> 05:26.166
YOU LOOK GOOD, MOM.

05:26.166 --> 05:28.542
NOT AS UPPER EAST SIDEY.

05:28.542 --> 05:30.291
I THINK THAT DIVORCE
MUST SUIT YOU.

05:30.291 --> 05:33.625
HMM. A LOT BETTER THAN
MARRIAGE, THAT'S FOR SURE.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.542
Grams: JENNIFER,
DID YOU GET THE DOOR?

05:38.750 --> 05:41.458
HELEN.

05:44.583 --> 05:46.000
HELLO.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.333
GOOD START.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.333
WELL, WHAT--WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:49.333 --> 05:52.000
JEN ASKED ME TO COME.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.166
I WAS SO SHOCKED,
I COULD HARDLY SAY NO.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.166
I CAN IMAGINE.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.792
I'LL JUST--CAN I TAKE
MY BAG UPSTAIRS?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.667
OH, OF COURSE.
UH, YOU GO ON UP,

06:00.667 --> 06:03.000
AND I'LL--I'LL
COME UP IN A MINUTE
AND GET YOU SETTLED.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
FINE.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.375
JENNIFER.
(STAMMERS)

06:13.375 --> 06:14.917
I KNOW, I KNOW,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.250
YOU'RE--YOU'RE WORRIED
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

06:16.250 --> 06:17.542
ENOUGH FOOD
FOR DINNER TONIGHT,

06:17.542 --> 06:19.333
BUT I'VE ACTUALLY
ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF THAT.

06:19.333 --> 06:22.041
JENNIFER, JUST DON'T PULL
YOUR SPEED-TALKING
TECHNIQUE ON ME.

06:22.041 --> 06:24.542
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO INVITE
THAT WOMAN INTO MY HOUSE.

06:24.542 --> 06:25.542
THAT WO--
WILL YOU CALM DOWN

06:25.542 --> 06:27.875
AND REMEMBER
THAT WE'RE ALL RELATED?

06:27.875 --> 06:29.125
NO, I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU

06:29.125 --> 06:32.166
I DID NOT WANT HELEN
TO KNOW THAT I HAD CANCER.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.208
CANCER?

06:34.959 --> 06:37.291
THE POINT IS,
IT IS MY BUSINESS

06:37.291 --> 06:39.041
TO DISPENSE WITH
IN MY OWN TIME,

06:39.041 --> 06:42.041
AND YOU HAD SOME NERVE
TO TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF
TO TELL HER.

06:42.041 --> 06:45.208
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

06:45.208 --> 06:46.542
YOU WILL.

06:46.542 --> 06:48.083
OH.

06:48.083 --> 06:49.708
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
THAT SHE'S ANY FRIGGIN'
MARY POPPINS, MYSELF,

06:49.708 --> 06:52.750
BUT I THINK
THAT SHE DESERVES
TO BE IN THE LOOP,

06:52.750 --> 06:54.750
AND I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.750
I LOVE YOU.

07:10.375 --> 07:13.083
DOES SHE ACTUALLY
RUN IN THESE?

07:13.083 --> 07:14.166
I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS.

07:14.166 --> 07:17.667
(STRUMS GUITAR)

07:17.667 --> 07:20.250
OH, OK, GROSS.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.750
NO, GROSS.

07:21.750 --> 07:25.458
GOD, CAN'T YOU JUST
PATRONIZE INTERNET PORN
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?

07:25.458 --> 07:27.458
MUST YOU GO ROOTING AROUND
IN MY ROOMMATE'S SWEATS

07:27.458 --> 07:28.583
LIKE THE HOMELESS MAN
YOU PRETEND TO BE?

07:28.583 --> 07:31.250
MY MOM WAS
SO RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.417
THIS HOITY-TOITY SCHOOL
HAS MADE YOU SO UPTIGHT.

07:34.417 --> 07:36.875
YOUR MOM THINKS
I'M UPTIGHT?

07:36.875 --> 07:39.291
I MAY HAVE
SOME IN YOUR SIZE
IF YOU WANT ME TO LOOK.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.959
THESE'LL DO JUST FINE.

07:41.959 --> 07:43.333
I'M JOEY.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.708
AH, THE ROOMMATE.
WE FINALLY MEET.

07:45.708 --> 07:48.291
COULD YOU PLEASE STEP
AWAY FROM THE CLOTHES?

07:48.291 --> 07:50.291
SLOWLY. AND KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

07:50.291 --> 07:53.542
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.333
JACK IS HERE TO MEET
WITH THE DEAN

07:55.333 --> 07:56.208
TO DISCUSS IF WORTHINGTON
IS RIGHT FOR HIM

07:56.208 --> 07:58.291
OR SOME SUCH HOO-HA.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.458
RIGHT FOR YOU?

08:00.458 --> 08:02.708
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
PEOPLE WOULD KILL
TO COME TO THIS SCHOOL?

08:02.708 --> 08:04.542
I MEAN,
I SPENT MY ENTIRE
HIGH-SCHOOL CAREER

08:04.542 --> 08:06.208
JUST TRYING TO GET
AN INTERVIEW HERE.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.625
YOU JUST--
IF IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU?

08:08.625 --> 08:09.917
YOU'RE TURNING
A LITTLE RED.

08:09.917 --> 08:11.041
NOW I KNOW THAT
THIS IS NEW TO YOU,

08:11.041 --> 08:14.166
BUT BEHOLD THE WRATH
OF THE HOLLYWOOD OFFSPRING.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.250
BUT JACK'S A SMART GUY,
AREN'T YOU, JACK?

08:16.250 --> 08:18.959
I'M SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW
IF MY INTEGRITY
IS BEING QUESTIONED

08:18.959 --> 08:21.083
BY A COUPLE
OF UPTIGHT WENCHES.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.333
YEAH, OK.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:22.333 --> 08:24.000
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CHANGE THE T-SHIRT.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.291
SO WHY DON'T YOU BE
A GOOD BOY AND GO
ROOT AROUND IN YOUR SATCHEL,

08:26.291 --> 08:28.000
BECAUSE JOEY AND I
HAVE TO BOND.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.375
I'LL WATCH
FROM A SAFE DISTANCE.

08:31.166 --> 08:33.500
(SIGHS) JOEY.
AUDREY.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.500
I FEEL A LIFETIME MOMENT
COMING ON.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.542
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE NEVER GOING

08:37.542 --> 08:39.166
TO SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

08:39.166 --> 08:41.332
I KNOW, BUT...

08:41.332 --> 08:43.291
OUR TIME IN THIS
PARTICULAR ROOM IS OVER.

08:43.291 --> 08:46.667
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS THIS--

08:46.667 --> 08:49.834
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH,
JOEY POTTER.

08:49.834 --> 08:52.667
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.250
SO MUCH SO, IN FACT,

08:56.250 --> 08:58.667
THAT I COULD NOT LEAVE YOU
WITHOUT A PARTING GIFT.

08:58.667 --> 09:02.250
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING FOR
THOSE LONELY SUMMER NIGHTS.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.542
UH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE,
AUDREY.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.333
I DIDN'T...

09:05.333 --> 09:06.959
YOU REALLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE.

09:06.959 --> 09:09.625
AUDREY, I HATE
THIS HIDEOUS EYESORE.

09:09.625 --> 09:11.708
I KNOW! WHICH IS WHY
YOU MUST CARRY IT WITH YOU

09:11.708 --> 09:14.917
ON ALL OF YOUR TRAVELS,
BECAUSE, LIKE ME,

09:14.917 --> 09:17.291
IT SEEMS HARSH
AND OVERWHELMING AT FIRST,

09:17.291 --> 09:19.542
BUT ONCE YOU GIVE IN
TO ITS DELICIOUS COMFORT,

09:19.542 --> 09:22.542
YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU
CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.041
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE REALIZED

09:24.041 --> 09:26.875
IN OUR TENURE TOGETHER?

09:26.875 --> 09:29.041
THAT I'VE NEVER
REALLY HAD A GIRLFRIEND,

09:29.041 --> 09:30.792
NOT A GOOD ONE...

09:30.792 --> 09:33.667
AND NOBODY LIKE YOU.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.708
OH, JOEY.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.250
UH, OK, JACK,
WHAT'S NEXT?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.917
UH, TOMATOES.

09:46.917 --> 09:50.000
SINCE, UM--SINCE WHEN DO YOU
KNOW HOW TO COOK, ANYWAY?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.250
OH, COME ON.
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

09:51.250 --> 09:53.417
I CAN READ, CAN'T I?

09:53.417 --> 09:54.417
I'M JUST SORRY
I WON'T BE THERE

09:54.417 --> 09:55.792
TO TEST
YOUR CULINARY SKILLS.

09:55.792 --> 09:57.000
YOU'RE COMING.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.250
NO. I'M NOT FACING
MY MOTHER WITHOUT YOU.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.250
WHICH IS EVEN
MORE SHOCKING

10:00.250 --> 10:01.250
THAN THE WHOLE
COOKING THING.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.875
W-WHY IS SHE IN TOWN?

10:02.875 --> 10:03.917
BECAUSE I CALLED HER,
ALL RIGHT.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.583
IT'S--IT'S A LONG STORY.

10:05.583 --> 10:06.959
I'M SURE IT'LL ALL
UNFOLD JUST BEAUTIFULLY
THIS EVENING,

10:06.959 --> 10:08.750
WHICH IS WHY
I NEED YOU THERE
FOR MORAL SUPPORT, OK?

10:08.750 --> 10:12.417
ISN'T C.J. TYPICALLY,
YOU KNOW, THE MORAL PART

10:12.417 --> 10:15.041
OF THE WHOLE,
YOU KNOW...EQUATION.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.792
LOOK, I JUST NEED
THE WHOLE GAMUT

10:16.792 --> 10:18.708
OF BOY POWER
THIS EVENING, OK?

10:18.708 --> 10:20.583
WHICH IS WHY
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THERE FOR THE WHOLE,

10:20.583 --> 10:22.250
YOU KNOW,
MEET THE BOYFRIEND THING.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.083
IT'S REALLY NOT,
LIKE, A WHOLE MEET
THE BOYFRIEND THING.

10:24.083 --> 10:27.333
I MEAN, IT--IT IS,
BUT THAT'S NOT ITS
EXPRESS PURPOSE, OK?

10:27.333 --> 10:30.750
EXACTLY. IT'S MORE
LIKE A, YOU KNOW,
"GOOD-BYE, C.J." TYPE OF NIGHT,

10:30.750 --> 10:32.625
'CAUSE HE'S GOING
TO NEW YORK TOMORROW, RIGHT,

10:32.625 --> 10:33.917
FOR THE WHOLE GRAD THING?

10:33.917 --> 10:36.250
YEAH, YEAH, YES,
HE IS, BUT I'M SURE

10:36.250 --> 10:38.250
THAT WE'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME TO STARE INTO
EACH OTHER'S EYES

10:38.250 --> 10:39.708
AND PONTIFICATE ON WHAT
WE MEAN TO EACH OTHER.

10:39.708 --> 10:40.792
I JUST NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST.

10:40.792 --> 10:43.667
STRING BEANS.
I NEED STRING BEANS.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.583
GO AHEAD.

13:26.333 --> 13:28.708
IT'S PERFECT.

13:28.708 --> 13:32.041
YOUR EYE FOR DETAIL
IS CREEPY.

13:32.041 --> 13:34.667
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GOING TO GET
IN THAT CLOSET AND PLAY E.T.,

13:34.667 --> 13:36.208
BUT ASIDE FROM THAT...

13:38.125 --> 13:40.000
IT'S PERFECT.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.708
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,
IT'S JUST ABOUT RIGHT.

13:48.041 --> 13:53.166
BUT YOU DO SEEM TO BE
QUITE WELL, HELEN.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.166
YOU, TOO, MOTHER.

13:55.166 --> 13:57.792
DID YOU CHANGE
YOUR HAIR?

13:57.792 --> 14:00.166
MAYBE
A LITTLE MORE GRAY.

14:00.166 --> 14:00.834
JENNIFER'S CHANGED
HER HAIR.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.875
DID YOU NOTICE?
MM.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.625
WE'VE ACTUALLY ALREADY
HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT.

14:07.959 --> 14:11.583
I HAVE HONEY ON MY HANDS.
UM, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.458
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
TRY TO FIND A TOPIC

14:13.458 --> 14:16.667
THAT IS MORE PROBING
THAN CURRENT HAIRSTYLES

14:16.667 --> 14:17.917
OR--OR WEATHER PATTERNS?

14:17.917 --> 14:19.166
AND I'LL GO WASH UP, OK?

14:22.667 --> 14:23.959
(WHISPERING)
That means you.

14:32.166 --> 14:35.041
IT SHOULDN'T BE
THIS DIFFICULT, I SUPPOSE,

14:35.041 --> 14:39.125
MAKING CONVERSATION
WITH YOUR OWN MOTHER.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.542
I THINK THE PROBLEM
IS THE VERY NOTION

14:44.542 --> 14:47.208
OF HAVING TO MAKE
CONVERSATION.

14:47.208 --> 14:50.625
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE
HAPPENING A LITTLE
TOO LATE, DOESN'T IT?

14:50.625 --> 14:54.542
I MEAN, WHY DID JEN
CALL ME OUT HERE NOW?

14:54.542 --> 14:56.458
WHY HAVE WE WAITED SO LONG?

14:56.458 --> 14:59.750
ONE THING I'VE LEARNED
IS TO REGRET THE PAST
IS USELESS.

14:59.750 --> 15:00.917
YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.792
MIGHT AS WELL LIVE
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

15:02.792 --> 15:05.667
AS PLEASANTLY
AS POSSIBLE.

15:05.667 --> 15:07.375
MOM, YOU'VE GONE SOFT.

15:07.375 --> 15:08.542
NEVER.

15:08.542 --> 15:11.625
NO, IT'S NICE.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.000
I THINK JEN'S
MADE YOU HAPPY.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.333
SHE SEEMS YOUNGER NOW
THAN SHE DID

15:18.333 --> 15:20.083
WHEN SHE WAS IN NEW YORK,

15:20.083 --> 15:23.083
RUNNING AROUND
LIKE A GROWNUP--

15:23.083 --> 15:25.667
A TOXIC ONE,
BUT A GROWNUP, NONETHELESS.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.583
IF SHE HAD STAYED THERE,
GOING THE WAY SHE WAS GOING...

15:32.708 --> 15:34.458
SHE WOULD HAVE RUN
RIGHT OVER ME, MOM.

15:35.708 --> 15:42.083
OH, HELEN. IT WASN'T
A MAGICAL TRANSFORMATION.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.625
SHE JUST NEEDED
A LITTLE PATIENCE

15:43.625 --> 15:47.083
AND, UM, NO ACCESS
TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.750
HMM.

15:48.750 --> 15:52.083
MM, IT'S FUNNY.

15:52.083 --> 15:56.041
NOW THAT SHE
DOESN'T NEED ME,

15:56.041 --> 15:57.750
KINDA THINK
THAT I NEED HER.

15:57.750 --> 16:01.792
NOT AS MUCH
AS I NEEDED YOU, THOUGH.

16:01.792 --> 16:04.625
I COULD--I COULD
NEVER REPAY YOU.

16:05.708 --> 16:12.625
ACTS OF LOVE DO NOT
REQUIRE REPAYMENT.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.041
I MEAN, WHAT IF I NEEDED
TO CALL UPON YOU

16:14.041 --> 16:16.625
AND--AND I NEEDED
YOUR HELP, YOUR SUPPORT?

16:16.625 --> 16:18.208
YOU'D BE THERE FOR ME,
WOULDN'T YOU?

16:18.208 --> 16:20.917
HOW COULD YOU EVEN ASK THAT?
YOU'RE MY MOTHER. OF COURSE.

16:24.291 --> 16:25.458
I GUESS
YOU GET TO MY AGE,

16:25.458 --> 16:28.250
YOU DON'T WANT
TO TAKE THESE THINGS
FOR GRANTED.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.166
MOM, IS EVERYTHING OK?

16:33.708 --> 16:34.959
IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH JENNIFER?

16:34.959 --> 16:36.542
JENNIFER?

16:36.542 --> 16:37.959
OH, NO.

16:37.959 --> 16:42.375
NO, NO, HELEN, NO,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

16:42.375 --> 16:46.667
I'M JUST A LITTLE
OVERWHELMED, I GUESS.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.041
OH, UH, WE NEED
SOME MORE WATER.

16:50.041 --> 16:53.667
I'LL JUST
FRESHEN UP THE POT.

17:16.583 --> 17:19.165
(GASPS)

17:19.165 --> 17:20.333
OH, MY GOD.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.959
MY EX-BOYFRIEND
IS A DAY DRINKER.

17:21.959 --> 17:25.165
LIFE IS CLEARLY BLEAK
WITHOUT ME.

17:25.165 --> 17:27.208
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
HE WORKED FOR THE MAN.

17:27.208 --> 17:30.792
HMM. LETS GO INVESTIGATE,
SHALL WE?

17:34.875 --> 17:36.250
HI.
HI.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.542
HI. AHH.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.792
SO OF ALL THE BARS
IN ALL THE WORLD

17:40.792 --> 17:41.792
YOU DECIDE TO
STUMBLE IN HERE.

17:41.792 --> 17:44.208
WELL, I AM STALKING YOU.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.041
HEY, JACK.

17:46.041 --> 17:47.000
HOW YOU DOING?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.792
AH, YOU KNOW,
IF THIS IS THE SCENE,

17:48.792 --> 17:50.708
NOT SO GOOD.

17:50.708 --> 17:52.917
I GOT TO TAKE A PISS.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.291
SO THEY TOLD ME
YOU WENT AWAY
FOR A WHILE.

17:57.291 --> 18:00.041
LET'S NOT BE AWKWARD
EXES, PACEY.

18:00.041 --> 18:01.875
I WAS DRYING OUT
IN MALIBU.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.208
OK.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.000
WELL, YOU LOOK GREAT,
ANYHOW.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.583
CLEAN LIVING, MY FRIEND.

18:08.583 --> 18:11.458
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR JOB?

18:11.458 --> 18:13.500
I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT JUST TAKING
A LONG LUNCH BREAK.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.250
YOU'RE A LITTLE
TOO HARD-CORE FOR THAT.

18:15.250 --> 18:19.166
WELL, I'VE BEEN
REASSESSING HOW
I ALLOCATE MY TIME.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.583
SO YOU'RE DRINKING?

18:21.583 --> 18:23.750
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.500
YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT TAKING A TASTY
DOWNWARD SPIRAL?

18:26.500 --> 18:27.291
OH, YOU'D BETTER QUIT
WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD.

18:27.291 --> 18:29.417
YOU'RE NOT CUT OUT
FOR THIS.

18:29.417 --> 18:30.750
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? I COULD SPIRAL
WITH THE BEST OF THEM.

18:30.750 --> 18:33.542
SPEAKING OF...

18:33.542 --> 18:35.875
SHOULDN'T YOU REALLY
AVOID PLACES LIKE THIS?

18:35.875 --> 18:38.625
I, UM, CAN'T HIDE
FROM MY PROBLEMS FOREVER.

18:38.625 --> 18:41.750
IT'S KIND OF HOW
I ENDED UP IN REHAB
IN THE FIRST PLACE, RIGHT?

18:41.750 --> 18:43.125
WELL,
THAT'S BRAVE OF YOU.

18:43.125 --> 18:44.834
BUT YOU WERE ALWAYS
GOOD LIKE THAT.

18:44.834 --> 18:48.291
YEAH, WELL, I'LL BE YOUR
PERSONAL SUPERHERO, OK?
OK.

18:48.291 --> 18:51.000
UNLESS OF COURSE
YOU WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR DAYS

18:51.000 --> 18:52.834
HIDING OUT IN DIVES
LIKE THIS.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.458
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING FROM,
PACEY?

18:57.458 --> 19:00.667
I'M HIDING
FROM THE SUIT,

19:00.667 --> 19:02.333
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL.

19:02.333 --> 19:05.542
BAD THINGS HAPPEN
WHEN IT'S ON.

19:05.542 --> 19:08.125
I ALLOWED PEOPLE
TO BELIEVE IN ME
FOR A SECOND,

19:08.125 --> 19:10.125
WHICH WAS FOOLISH,
AND NOW IT'S REALLY

19:10.125 --> 19:12.291
COMING BACK TO BITE
THEM IN THE ASS.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.208
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:14.208 --> 19:15.291
THIS ISN'T YOU TALKING.

19:15.291 --> 19:18.041
THIS IS YOUR FORMER SELF
REARING ITS UGLY HEAD.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.834
COME ON, PACEY.

19:21.834 --> 19:23.000
I KNOW MOMENTS LIKE THESE.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.542
ONE PATH
IS THE HARSH REALITY,

19:25.542 --> 19:28.792
AND ONE PATH
IS THE COMFORTABLY NUMB.
BUT GUESS WHAT?

19:28.792 --> 19:30.250
IN THE MORNING,
WHEN YOU'RE ALL SOBERED UP,

19:30.250 --> 19:31.417
THE PROBLEM'S
STILL GONNA BE THERE.

19:31.417 --> 19:36.083
ONLY, NOW IT'LL BE LIKE
A BIG FESTERING WOUND,

19:36.083 --> 19:39.333
AND YOU'LL JUST BE
THE JERK WHO SAT BACK
AND LET IT GET WORSE.

19:39.333 --> 19:43.041
WELL, THANKS FOR NOT
WALKING ON EGGSHELLS
AROUND ME.

19:50.875 --> 19:52.041
IT'S WEIRD, HUH?

19:53.333 --> 19:55.208
THIS ROOM USED TO BE
THE OFFICIAL MEETING PLACE

19:55.208 --> 19:58.166
WHERE WE'D DISCUSS
WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.500
AND NOW
IT'S JUST A FILM SET,

20:00.500 --> 20:03.083
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.583
YEAH.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.125
I WAS KIND OF HOPING

20:07.125 --> 20:09.917
I COULD JUST CLIMB
UP THE LADDER AND...

20:09.917 --> 20:13.667
MAGICALLY FILL IN
ALL THE LOST TIME.

20:13.667 --> 20:14.834
HOW'S THAT
WORKING FOR YOU?

20:14.834 --> 20:15.875
NOT SO EASY.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.458
YEAH.

20:17.458 --> 20:20.208
MAYBE I WAS GONE
FOR TOO LONG.

20:20.208 --> 20:23.917
WELL, WE'LL PIECE
IT TOGETHER BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US THEN, RIGHT?

20:23.917 --> 20:27.000
THE LOST YEAR
OF DAWSON AND JOEY.

20:29.250 --> 20:29.750
IT WASN'T EASY.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.083
WHAT WASN'T?

20:36.208 --> 20:38.000
NOT TALKING TO YOU.

20:40.708 --> 20:42.375
MAYBE IT SEEMED
LIKE IT WAS.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.375
AND I GUESS IT JUST...
BECAME ROUTINE,

20:45.375 --> 20:49.834
JUST ANOTHER THING
THAT I DIDN'T DO.

20:49.834 --> 20:54.834
WELL, LIKE SHOOTING HEROIN
OR DRIVING DRUNK.

20:54.834 --> 20:55.917
WOW, I'M UP THERE
WITH THE DANGEROUS
ACTIVITIES.

20:55.917 --> 20:57.542
OR CASUAL SEX.

20:59.917 --> 21:02.375
DAWSON, FOR SO LONG,
YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON

21:02.375 --> 21:05.708
IN THE WHOLE WORLD
I WANTED TO BE WITH.

21:05.708 --> 21:09.375
THEN SOMEHOW YOU BECAME
MY ONLY ONE-NIGHT STAND.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.041
I NEVER MEANT
FOR IT TO BE LIKE THAT.

21:11.041 --> 21:11.875
I KNOW.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.542
I KNOW.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.500
MAYBE BEING IN THIS ROOM
MAKES IT EASIER.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.583
HAVING IT SET UP
THIS WAY,

21:24.583 --> 21:26.000
YOU KNOW,
I'M SO FAMILIAR, AND...

21:26.000 --> 21:31.333
SEEMS INSANE NOT TO TALK.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.834
AND SOMETIMES
THE HARDEST THINGS TO SAY

21:33.834 --> 21:35.083
ARE THE THINGS THAT...

21:38.083 --> 21:40.333
REALLY MATTER.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.583
HMM.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.125
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'VE SPENT YEARS

21:44.125 --> 21:45.583
TRYING TO WRITE
AN ENTIRE SCREENPLAY
ABOUT YOU?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.125
I READ IT IN ONE SITTING.
OK.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.000
I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I GAVE IT TO YOU

21:51.000 --> 21:53.125
SO THAT
YOU COULD JUST SAY

21:53.125 --> 21:54.500
ALL THE OBLIGATORY
NICE THINGS.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.250
AND WHY WOULD I
FEEL OBLIGATED?

21:56.250 --> 21:58.500
EXACTLY, BECAUSE IF I CAN'T
GET AN HONEST OPINION

21:58.500 --> 22:00.500
FROM THE GIRL
WHO LOATHES ME MORE THAN
ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD,

22:00.500 --> 22:01.542
WHO CAN I TRUST, RIGHT?

22:01.542 --> 22:04.000
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THIS DEVILISHLY CLEVER.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.625
WELL...

22:06.625 --> 22:07.792
YEAH.

22:07.792 --> 22:08.959
BUT...

22:10.959 --> 22:12.166
UH, I GOT--I GOT--

22:12.166 --> 22:13.792
I WANTED YOU
TO READ IT BECAUSE...

22:16.667 --> 22:18.834
WELL, YOU'RE REALLY
THE ONLY PERSON
IN THE WORLD

22:18.834 --> 22:21.458
WHO CAN TELL ME IF I
GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME.

22:24.834 --> 22:26.583
YOU GREW UP, DAWSON.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.583
YOU GREW UP.

22:34.458 --> 22:36.750
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO THINK THAT YOU WERE
THIS HOPELESS DREAMER

22:36.750 --> 22:39.583
AND I WAS THE ADULT
THAT ESCAPED.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.375
BUT I DIDN'T ESCAPE
ANYTHING, NOT REALLY.

22:44.375 --> 22:47.000
SURE YOU DID.
YOU GOT OUT OF CAPESIDE.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.125
WASN'T THAT
THE ORIGINAL PLAN?

22:51.166 --> 22:53.625
COULDN'T ESCAPE MYSELF,
COULD I?

22:53.625 --> 22:55.291
YOU WERE RIGHT.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.000
SO MUCH OF WHAT
I WAS FIGHTING
WAS GROWING UP.

23:02.667 --> 23:06.083
AND I FIGURED OUT
THIS PAST YEAR
THAT IT'S HARD FOR ME...

23:08.625 --> 23:10.542
TO TALK ABOUT SEX,
TO TALK ABOUT...

23:11.375 --> 23:13.750
GETTING CLOSE WITH SOMEONE.

23:15.583 --> 23:17.583
AND MAYBE...

23:17.583 --> 23:18.708
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO LOSE MYSELF.

23:20.375 --> 23:25.417
NOW IT'S NOT PART
OF THE PLAN.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.708
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT LOSING YOU

23:27.708 --> 23:29.083
WAS PART
OF THE PLAN, EITHER.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.750
I THINK SOMETIMES...

23:32.834 --> 23:35.208
YOU HAVE TO LOSE
SOMEBODY COMPLETELY

23:35.208 --> 23:37.250
BEFORE YOU CAN
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY
REALLY MEAN TO YOU.

23:40.583 --> 23:42.333
I MISSED YOU, JOE.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.417
YOU GOT IT RIGHT
THIS TIME, DAWSON.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.500
I MISSED US.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.583
SO HOW DID
YOU AND JENNIFER MEET?

24:12.583 --> 24:17.291
OH, NO, I'M--I'M JACK,
MRS. LINDLEY.

24:17.291 --> 24:18.583
WELL, YES, I KNOW THAT.

24:18.583 --> 24:21.125
YEAH, WELL,
T-THIS IS, UM,

24:21.125 --> 24:22.792
THIS IS JEN'S
BOYFRIEND HERE.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.125
OH, I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE NOT...

24:24.125 --> 24:25.625
NO, NO.
I'M--I'M THE GAY ONE.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.959
ACTUALLY WE, UM--
WE MET A FEW YEARS BACK.

24:29.959 --> 24:31.625
I GUESS YOU DON'T
REMEMBER ME.

24:31.625 --> 24:33.708
OH, RIGHT.

24:33.708 --> 24:34.458
THAT WASN'T
THE BEST THANKSGIVING.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.208
UM, I WAS
PROBABLY DRUNK.

24:36.208 --> 24:39.000
YEAH. I KNOW I WAS.

24:40.917 --> 24:44.917
THAT WAS A JOKE.
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.750
JEN SPEAKS
VERY HIGHLY OF YOU.

24:46.750 --> 24:47.792
WELL, APPARENTLY
NOT VERY DESCRIPTIVE.

24:47.792 --> 24:52.458
WELL, YOU AND JACK
ARE BOTH SO ATTRACTIVE,

24:52.458 --> 24:56.625
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE GAYS LOOK LIKE
THESE DAYS.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.750
THANK YOU?

24:58.750 --> 25:00.208
ARE YOU GOING TO SCHOOL
IN NEW YORK?

25:00.208 --> 25:01.625
YES, UH,
LEAVING TOMORROW ACTUALLY.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.125
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
TO CALL ME.

25:03.125 --> 25:04.458
I KNOW LOTS
OF YOUNG PEOPLE

25:04.458 --> 25:05.708
WHO COULD TAKE YOU
OUT ON THE TOWN.

25:05.708 --> 25:09.083
THE PARKERS, WHO LIVE
DOWNSTAIRS FROM ME,

25:09.083 --> 25:09.750
HAVE
2 LOVELY DAUGHTERS...

25:09.750 --> 25:11.000
OK, MOM, THAT'S ENOUGH.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.625
MY BOYFRIEND DOESN'T NEED
TO BE MEETING ANYONE LOVELY.

25:14.625 --> 25:16.333
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
BREAKING UP OR ANYTHING

25:16.333 --> 25:17.291
OH, GOOD TO KNOW.

25:17.291 --> 25:19.083
WELL, I'VE ONLY
JUST FIGURED OUT NOW

25:19.083 --> 25:20.333
WHICH ONE
IS YOUR BOYFRIEND.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.083
WELL, THAT'S
BECAUSE JACK ACTS
LIKE A BOYFRIEND.

25:22.083 --> 25:25.333
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
TECHNICALLY,
I AM HER BOYFRIEND.

25:25.333 --> 25:26.750
TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

25:26.750 --> 25:27.834
YOU DON'T
SLEEP WITH ME.

25:27.834 --> 25:29.333
IS THAT
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US?

25:29.333 --> 25:30.792
LOOK, WHO'S LEAVING ME
FOR HIGHER LEARNING
TOMORROW?

25:30.792 --> 25:32.834
HEY, COME ON. YOU SAID
YOU WERE HAPPY FOR ME.

25:32.834 --> 25:34.667
I AM, BUT DON'T BEGRUDGE
ME THE ONLY FRIEND

25:34.667 --> 25:36.250
THAT I HAVE LEFT
IN YOUR ABSENCE.

25:36.250 --> 25:37.792
JEN, YOU WERE
ALWAYS SO POPULAR.

25:37.792 --> 25:38.708
I KNOW. THAT WAS CALLED
PUTTING OUT, MOM.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.542
EVIE, YOU GET
YOUR BUTT OUT HERE.

25:47.542 --> 25:48.792
UNCLE BILL, WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU--

25:48.792 --> 25:49.708
HEY, HEY, COOL IT.

25:49.708 --> 25:51.875
I GOT SOME BUSINESS
WITH THIS SKIRT,

25:51.875 --> 25:53.750
AND I'M NOT LEAVING
TILL IT'S FINISHED.

25:53.750 --> 25:54.708
EVIE!

25:54.708 --> 25:56.041
DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

25:56.041 --> 25:57.250
YEAH, HE'S C.J.'s
UNCLE BILL.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.083
HE--HE AND GRAMS
HAD A THING.

25:59.083 --> 26:00.750
A THING?

26:03.333 --> 26:05.625
WILLIAM, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

26:05.625 --> 26:08.708
NOW LOOK, YOU JUST
DON'T WALK AWAY
FROM BILL BRAXTON

26:08.708 --> 26:11.583
AND EXPECT HIM
TO ROLL OVER
LIKE A DEAD DOG.

26:11.583 --> 26:13.583
I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME P.I. WORK ON YOU,

26:13.583 --> 26:16.250
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I FOUND OUT?

26:16.250 --> 26:18.542
YOU ARE FULL OF MALARKEY.

26:18.542 --> 26:21.542
BILL, THIS IS NEITHER
THE TIME OR THE PLACE
FOR THIS CONVERSATION.

26:21.542 --> 26:23.708
THAT'S HALF
YOUR PROBLEM RIGHT THERE.

26:23.708 --> 26:28.208
YOU KEEP WANTING
TO COMPARTMENTALIZE
EVERYTHING IN TIME AND SPACE,

26:28.208 --> 26:32.125
AND YOU'RE MAKING
YOURSELF SICK, AND THAT'S
WHY YOU HAVE CANCER,

26:32.125 --> 26:33.542
AND YOU'RE EATING
YOURSELF UP.

26:36.917 --> 26:38.625
MOM...

26:38.625 --> 26:41.250
IS THIS TRUE?

26:41.250 --> 26:42.959
YES.

26:45.083 --> 26:48.875
YES, HELEN, IT'S--
IT'S TRUE. UM...

26:48.875 --> 26:51.750
I--I CERTAINLY
NEVER INTENDED FOR YOU
TO FIND IT OUT THIS WAY.

26:51.750 --> 26:56.208
LOOK, I DON'T WANNA
WATCH ANOTHER WOMAN...

26:56.208 --> 26:58.834
WHO I LOVE, GIVE UP.

26:58.834 --> 27:02.875
WERE YOU SENT HERE
ON THIS EARTH TO DIE ALONE

27:02.875 --> 27:04.625
WITH YOUR KNITTING NEEDLES,

27:04.625 --> 27:06.083
OR WERE YOU SENT HERE
TO LIVE A LITTLE?

27:06.083 --> 27:09.625
YOU MUST HAVE
FAILED TO NOTICE
THAT I AM NOT ALONE.

27:09.625 --> 27:14.458
YES, I CAN SEE THERE ARE
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE HERE
WHO GIVE A DAMN,

27:14.458 --> 27:16.750
AND EVEN THOUGH
YOU SPURNED MY ADVANCES,

27:16.750 --> 27:18.959
I GIVE A DAMN, TOO.

27:22.625 --> 27:24.000
Jen: GRAMS...

27:24.000 --> 27:27.166
AREN'T YOU GONNA
THANK BILL FOR DOING
YOUR DIRTY WORK FOR YA?

27:27.166 --> 27:29.208
(SCOFFS)

27:29.208 --> 27:31.708
THANK YOU, JENNIFER.
I WAS JUST...

27:31.708 --> 27:32.500
ABOUT TO DO THAT.

27:32.500 --> 27:35.959
YOU MEAN,
NOBODY ELSE KNEW?

27:35.959 --> 27:38.625
NO, BILL,
NOBODY ELSE KNEW,

27:38.625 --> 27:41.500
WHICH ACCOUNTS
FOR THE SHOCK
ON MY DAUGHTER'S FACE.

27:41.500 --> 27:45.959
I--I--I GOTTA SAY, GRAMS,
I'M PRETTY SHOCKED, TOO.

27:45.959 --> 27:48.875
JEN, WHAT'S UP?
YOU WANNA TELL ME?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.291
Grams: JACK, IT WAS
NOT JENNIFER'S
RESPONSIBILITY

27:51.291 --> 27:53.000
TO TELL YOU.
IT WAS MINE.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.875
I'M SORRY.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.417
THIS IS WHY YOU CALLED ME?

27:57.417 --> 27:58.750
YEP.

27:58.750 --> 28:01.834
I--I DON'T KNOW.
GRAMS TOLD ME THAT
SHE HAD BREAST CANCER,

28:01.834 --> 28:04.834
AND IT--AND IT WAS JUST
LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD
MELTED AWAY,

28:04.834 --> 28:09.417
BUT I HAD A THOUSAND
QUESTIONS IN MY HEAD

28:09.417 --> 28:13.083
OF HOW AM I GOING TO
TAKE CARE OF HER
AND HOW LONG DO WE HAVE,

28:13.083 --> 28:16.208
AND, BILL,
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:16.208 --> 28:19.875
I MEAN, GRAMS, YOU CAN'T
TRY AND BE A ROCK HERE,

28:19.875 --> 28:23.500
BECAUSE IT'S--IT'S NOT
MAKING YOU ANY HAPPIER
OR ANY BETTER,

28:23.500 --> 28:24.917
AND IT'S NOT MAKING
YOUR LIFE ANY EASIER,

28:24.917 --> 28:27.875
SO I--I JUST FEEL LIKE
THE BEST THING FOR YOU
TO DO RIGHT NOW

28:27.875 --> 28:31.041
IS JUST TO BE AROUND
YOUR FAMILY.

28:33.792 --> 28:34.875
I'M SO SORRY.

28:36.417 --> 28:39.041
WHAT CAN I DO?

28:39.041 --> 28:40.333
Jen: WELL...

28:40.333 --> 28:41.875
ACTUALLY,
IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK

28:41.875 --> 28:44.375
BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE HAVE
KIND OF AN INTERESTING
OPPORTUNITY HERE.

28:44.375 --> 28:47.542
OPPORTUNITY FOR WHAT?

28:47.542 --> 28:50.000
TO MOVE TO NEW YORK
TO LIVE WITH MOM.

28:54.458 --> 28:56.542
I DON'T EVEN REALLY
WANNA FIGHT ABOUT IT
OR DISCUSS IT.

28:56.542 --> 28:58.166
I JUST WANT IT TO BE OK.

28:59.750 --> 29:03.291
OH, HELEN, I--I--
I COULDN'T DREAM OF...

29:03.291 --> 29:04.417
IMPOSING--

29:04.417 --> 29:06.708
Jen: NO, IT'S NOT.

29:06.708 --> 29:07.917
SHE LIVES 5 MINUTES AWAY

29:07.917 --> 29:10.875
FROM THE BEST HOSPITAL
IN THE COUNTRY.

29:10.875 --> 29:14.458
I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S
ANY IMPOSITION IN THAT.

29:14.458 --> 29:15.458
BUT I--I--I--

29:15.458 --> 29:17.708
NO. MOM, IT'S OK.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.750
SHE'S RIGHT.

29:27.583 --> 29:29.792
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW LATE IT HAD GOTTEN.

29:29.792 --> 29:31.208
YEAH, WHEN YOU
CAME OVER HERE, YOU
PROBABLY DIDN'T EXPECT

29:31.208 --> 29:33.417
TO SPEND
THE WHOLE AFTERNOON
TALKIN', HUH?

29:33.417 --> 29:34.458
CALL IT A NICE SURPRISE.

29:34.458 --> 29:36.458
WELL, I'VE STILL GOT
ONE BIG PROBLEM, THOUGH.

29:36.458 --> 29:38.417
WHAT'S THAT?

29:38.417 --> 29:40.083
SAME ONE I'VE ALWAYS HAD,

29:40.083 --> 29:42.125
FINDING SOMEBODY
TO PLAY YOU.

29:49.375 --> 29:51.750
PACEY.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.917
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HOME.

29:55.834 --> 29:57.625
WELL, I WASN'T REALLY
PLANNING ON MAKING A TRIP,

29:57.625 --> 29:59.500
BUT I NEEDED TO TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND.
IS THAT OK, DAWSON?

29:59.500 --> 30:00.959
YEAH, OF COURSE.

30:00.959 --> 30:05.291
I, UH--I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW MAYBE?

30:05.291 --> 30:06.291
DEAL.

30:06.291 --> 30:06.875
ALL RIGHT.

30:06.875 --> 30:07.959
ACTUALLY, JO, UM...

30:07.959 --> 30:10.375
WHY DON'T YOU
HANG OUT FOR A SECOND,

30:10.375 --> 30:12.500
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO HEAR THIS
SOONER OR LATER ANYWAY.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.500
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
ARE YOU OK?

30:17.125 --> 30:21.041
MAN, AND WE WERE JUST GETTIN'
BACK TO BE FRIENDS, TOO.
IT'S SUCH A SHAME TO RUIN THAT.

30:21.041 --> 30:22.500
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT WOULD RUIN IT?

30:23.667 --> 30:26.583
MONEY. MONEY WOULD RUIN IT.

30:26.583 --> 30:31.166
W-WHAT HAPPENED?

30:31.166 --> 30:32.083
IT'S GONE.

30:32.083 --> 30:35.125
YOUR MONEY'S GONE,
MY MONEY'S GONE,

30:35.125 --> 30:37.834
SOME GUY ON LONG ISLAND'S
MONEY IS GONE--

30:37.834 --> 30:39.959
WHAT--WHAT
DO YOU MEAN GONE?

30:39.959 --> 30:42.667
THAT WAS ALL
THE MONEY THAT I HAD.

30:42.667 --> 30:43.792
I KNOW IT WAS, DAWSON,
AND I HONESTLY THOUGHT

30:43.792 --> 30:47.708
STEPATECH WAS GONNA
TAKE OFF, I SWEAR TO YOU.

30:47.708 --> 30:50.959
RIGHT. YEAH, O-OF COURSE.

30:50.959 --> 30:53.083
OTHERWISE WHY WOULD YOU
BLATANTLY IGNORE MY REQUEST
TO SELL THE STOCK?

30:53.083 --> 30:56.166
MAN, I WAS JUST TRYIN'
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

30:56.166 --> 30:57.375
AH, DAMN IT, PACEY, THIS--

30:57.375 --> 31:00.875
(DAWSON SIGHS)

31:00.875 --> 31:02.458
YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYIN'
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

31:02.458 --> 31:05.500
YOU'RE ALWAYS SO EAGER
TO BE THE HERO,

31:05.500 --> 31:08.708
YOU NEVER QUITE SEE
ALL THE PIECES
OF THE PUZZLE.

31:08.708 --> 31:10.834
Pacey: DAWSON...

31:10.834 --> 31:12.083
YOU CAME TO ME WITH YOUR DREAM

31:12.083 --> 31:14.041
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT I COULD
HELP MAKE SOMETHING OF IT,

31:14.041 --> 31:17.875
AND SOMEHOW THIS COMES BACK
YET AGAIN TO THE FACT

31:17.875 --> 31:19.708
THAT I SCREWED YOU OVER?

31:19.708 --> 31:21.333
Joey: OK,
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU TWO?

31:21.333 --> 31:23.333
LET'S JUST STICK
TO THE TOPIC AT HAND.

31:23.333 --> 31:26.417
OK, SO WE CAN JUST
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

31:26.417 --> 31:30.625
BY GOING INSIDE
AND TRYING TO GET CALM...

31:30.625 --> 31:32.875
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

31:32.875 --> 31:35.834
JOEY, TALKING
ABOUT THIS IS NOT
GONNA SOLVE ANYTHING.

31:35.834 --> 31:37.166
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

31:37.166 --> 31:40.667
HE MEANS
IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY.

31:40.667 --> 31:43.875
SO FINE THEN, LET'S JUST
TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY
GOIN' ON HERE.

31:43.875 --> 31:47.125
YOU KNOW WHAT? I SEE
NO REASON TO DRUDGE UP
BAGGAGE FROM THE PAST

31:47.125 --> 31:49.000
JUST TO FILL IN
THE MOMENT, PACEY.

31:49.000 --> 31:49.917
I MEAN,
LET'S REMEMBER SOMETHING.

31:49.917 --> 31:53.125
THIS EXCHANGE
BETWEEN YOU AND DAWSON

31:53.125 --> 31:54.708
IS PURELY
A BUSINESS EXCHANGE,

31:54.708 --> 31:57.208
AND I THINK
WE NEED TO REMEMBER
TO KEEP IT AT THAT.

31:57.208 --> 31:58.375
SHE'S RIGHT.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.041
IT IS BUSINESS
BETWEEN US,
'CAUSE GOD KNOWS

32:00.041 --> 32:02.417
WE HAVEN'T BEEN
BEST FRIENDS
IN A LONG TIME, HAVE WE?

32:03.875 --> 32:06.125
NO, WE CERTAINLY HAVE NOT.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.750
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS, PACE?

32:08.750 --> 32:10.250
IT'S NOT BECAUSE
OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH JOEY,

32:10.250 --> 32:12.583
EVEN THOUGH THAT TURNED
MY WORLD UPSIDE DOWN.

32:12.583 --> 32:14.959
IT'S BECAUSE FROM
THAT DAY FORWARD, I REALIZED

32:14.959 --> 32:17.458
THAT YOU HADN'T
BEEN MY FRIEND FOR...

32:17.458 --> 32:18.667
MAYBE QUITE SOME TIME,

32:18.667 --> 32:20.834
'CAUSE THE SECOND
YOU MADE US COMPETITORS--

32:20.834 --> 32:22.500
THAT I  MADE US COMPETITORS?

32:22.500 --> 32:24.250
NO. NO. NOW--NOW YOU'RE
REWRITING HISTORY, DAWSON.

32:24.250 --> 32:28.041
I REMEMBER WHEN
MY BEST FRIEND
HAD A CHOICE

32:28.041 --> 32:29.875
AND CHOSE
TO TURN HIS BACK ON ME.

32:29.875 --> 32:31.542
IF YOU'D EVER
STOPPED SETTIN' US UP
AGAINST EACH OTHER,

32:31.542 --> 32:34.583
YOU WOULDA REALIZED
THAT YOU AND I ARE
NOT THAT FAR APART.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.917
AH, SPARE ME THE SPEECH.
YOU ARE NOT GONNA CONVINCE ME

32:36.917 --> 32:39.083
THAT OUR WORLD'S...
ARE ANYTHING ALIKE.

32:39.083 --> 32:43.041
YOU'RE JUST UPSET
BECAUSE I BROKE OUTTA MINE.

32:43.041 --> 32:44.875
BROKE OUT OF YOURS? HOW?
BY PUTTING ON A SUIT

32:44.875 --> 32:46.458
AND SLAVIN' AWAY AT
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T
EVEN INTEREST YOU?

32:46.458 --> 32:50.458
YOU MADE MONEY.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU IMPRESSED US ALL.

32:50.458 --> 32:52.834
HOW DARE YOU.
YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT ME, MAN.

32:52.834 --> 32:55.458
I WAS GOOD  AT MY JOB.

32:55.458 --> 32:56.458
THEN WHY AM I BROKE?

32:56.458 --> 32:57.125
BECAUSE THAT'S LIFE!

32:57.125 --> 33:00.083
I DIDN'T MAKE THAT CHOICE!

33:00.083 --> 33:02.792
I HAVE LOST,
LITERALLY, EVERYTHING!

33:02.792 --> 33:04.792
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, MAN?

33:04.792 --> 33:06.625
DOES THIS MAKE YOU HAPPY,

33:06.625 --> 33:08.500
THAT YOU'RE BACK
ON TOP NOW?

33:08.500 --> 33:09.792
I MEAN, YOU ALWAYS
LIKED IT BETTER
WHEN YOU WERE IN CHARGE,

33:09.792 --> 33:13.667
SO IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED?
DOES THIS MAKE IT ALL RIGHT?

33:13.667 --> 33:17.708
YOU DON'T
WANNA KNOW ME, PACE.

33:17.708 --> 33:20.291
YOU WROTE ME OFF
A LONG TIME AGO.

33:20.291 --> 33:22.458
REALLY? REALLY?

33:22.458 --> 33:26.166
BACK WHEN WE WERE
THE BEST OF FRIENDS?
WHEN WE WERE BROTHERS?

33:26.166 --> 33:29.041
WAS I JUST OUTTA THE HOUSE
EVERY TIME YOU TRIED TO CALL ME
OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS?

33:29.041 --> 33:32.166
OK, CAN YOU GUYS
JUST STOP IT?

33:32.166 --> 33:36.458
I CAN'T STAND HERE
AND LISTEN TO YOU GUYS
DO THIS ANYMORE.

33:37.917 --> 33:41.959
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO LOSE YOUR MONEY.

33:41.959 --> 33:44.667
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.792
I'M SORRY.

33:48.708 --> 33:51.041
YEAH, SO AM I.

33:51.041 --> 33:53.333
THIS--

33:55.000 --> 33:58.125
THIS WAS JUST A BIG MISTAKE
FROM THE BEGINNING, I GUESS.

33:59.667 --> 34:03.917
HEH. OK.

34:35.625 --> 34:37.667
YOU OK, PACE?

34:37.667 --> 34:39.291
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
DO WHAT?

34:41.542 --> 34:42.708
SIT OUT HERE WITH ME.

34:42.708 --> 34:45.208
I KNOW YOU'D RATHER BE
IN THE HOUSE WITH DAWSON,

34:45.208 --> 34:48.208
SO WHY DO YOU JUST GO
AND HELP HIM LICK HIS WOUNDS?

34:48.208 --> 34:50.458
THINGS NEVER CHANGE
HERE, DO THEY?

34:50.458 --> 34:51.708
NO...

34:51.708 --> 34:54.375
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE ROLES
WE WERE DESTINED TO PLAY.

34:54.375 --> 34:57.750
NO, PACE,
THESE ARE THE ROLES
WE CHOSE TO PLAY.

34:57.750 --> 35:00.083
I MEAN, LOOK AT US,

35:00.083 --> 35:02.625
SITTING OUT HERE
ON THIS DOCK IN FRONT
OF THE SAME HOUSE

35:02.625 --> 35:04.083
WE'VE BEEN HAUNTING
FOR YEARS.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.583
WE'RE PRACTICALLY GHOSTS
OF OUR FORMER SELVES,

35:05.583 --> 35:09.417
AND HONESTLY,
I DON'T THINK ANYONE
REALLY REMEMBERS

35:09.417 --> 35:10.375
WHAT THEY'RE
MAD ABOUT ANYMORE.

35:10.375 --> 35:14.166
MM, I WOULDN'T
BE SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

35:16.542 --> 35:18.417
PACEY, IF I WANTED TO GO
BACK INTO THAT HOUSE,

35:18.417 --> 35:21.083
I WOULD'VE GONE
A LONG TIME AGO.

35:21.083 --> 35:23.417
DON'T YOU KNOW ME
AT ALL BY NOW?

35:23.417 --> 35:25.792
WELL, I DON'T
WANT YOU SITTING HERE
FEELING SORRY FOR ME.

35:25.792 --> 35:29.166
I DON'T
FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.
I FEEL  FOR YOU, PACEY.

35:29.166 --> 35:30.291
(SIGHS)

35:30.291 --> 35:32.291
GOD, CAN'T YOU EVER
TELL THE DIFFERENCE?

35:32.291 --> 35:33.458
I DON'T KNOW.

35:33.458 --> 35:34.458
(SIGHS)

35:34.458 --> 35:36.125
I DON'T KNOW,
BECAUSE YOU AND I HAVE HAD

35:36.125 --> 35:39.333
A VERY CONFUSING RUN
OF THINGS.

35:39.333 --> 35:39.750
ESPECIALLY LATELY.

35:39.750 --> 35:42.291
(SCOFFS)

35:42.291 --> 35:43.333
OK.

35:43.333 --> 35:46.291
YOU KNOW, AND NO MATTER
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU

35:46.291 --> 35:47.792
OR HOW LONG
I STAY WITH YOU,

35:47.792 --> 35:49.125
YOU'RE ONLY GONNA
REMEMBER THE MOMENTS
WHEN I LEAVE.

35:49.125 --> 35:52.166
WELL, YOU GOTTA
GIVE ME THAT MUCH,

35:52.166 --> 35:56.625
BECAUSE THOSE ARE PRETTY MUCH
THE MOST PAINFUL
MOMENTS IN MY LIFE.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.583
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU
ASK FOR THEM, PACEY.

35:58.583 --> 35:59.959
I'M SORRY. YOU DO.

35:59.959 --> 36:03.291
YOUR WHOLE LIFE,
YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME
EXPECTING THE WORST

36:03.291 --> 36:06.792
THAT YOU DON'T EVEN
NOTICE THE MOMENTS WHEN
PEOPLE ARE LOVING YOU,

36:06.792 --> 36:09.542
AND, PACEY, PEOPLE
SPEND A LOT OF TIME
LOVING YOU.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.041
WELL...

36:11.041 --> 36:13.333
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, JO,

36:13.333 --> 36:17.834
MY BEST FRIEND
JUST WALKED AWAY FROM ME,

36:17.834 --> 36:19.375
BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN
THE WORST OF IT.

36:19.375 --> 36:22.875
THE WORST THING IS
HE HASN'T EVEN REALLY KNOWN ME
FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS,

36:22.875 --> 36:24.166
SO PLEASE,
CLARIFY THAT FOR ME.

36:24.166 --> 36:26.667
HOW DOES THAT QUALIFY ME
AS A MAN WITH A SUPPORT NETWORK?

36:26.667 --> 36:29.917
WELL, YOU HAVE A PERSON
SITTING RIGHT HERE,
DON'T YOU?

36:29.917 --> 36:32.542
BUT OF COURSE,
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

36:32.542 --> 36:34.000
NOT UNTIL YOU LET IT.

36:34.000 --> 36:34.792
IN WHAT WORLD
DO I HAVE YOU?

36:34.792 --> 36:37.333
LOOK,

36:37.333 --> 36:39.291
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T
FIT INTO THAT...

36:39.291 --> 36:40.542
PLACE  YOU WANT ME TO

36:40.542 --> 36:42.875
DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NOT
A PLACE FOR ME, PACEY.

36:42.875 --> 36:45.458
(SIGHS)

36:45.458 --> 36:48.250
DOES IT?

36:48.250 --> 36:50.500
JOEY, THIS ISN'T
YOUR FIGHT, ANYWAY.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.000
YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.875
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S NOT MY FIGHT

36:53.875 --> 36:55.208
BECAUSE
IT'S BEEN OVER

36:55.208 --> 36:57.917
FOR A REALLY
LONG TIME, PACEY,

36:57.917 --> 36:59.166
(SIGHS)

36:59.166 --> 37:01.792
AND IT IS UP TO YOU
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

37:03.375 --> 37:05.458
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

37:05.458 --> 37:10.083
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT.

37:10.083 --> 37:14.542
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
THE THING ABOUT GHOSTS.

37:14.542 --> 37:17.125
THEY SAY THAT...
THEY DON'T LEAVE

37:17.125 --> 37:19.917
UNTIL THEY'RE
AT PEACE WITH WHAT
THEY LEFT UNDONE.

37:25.208 --> 37:27.041
(CHUCKLES)

37:28.583 --> 37:29.417
HEY.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.375
SO...

37:33.375 --> 37:34.250
I GUESS
ANY PETTY BICKERING

37:34.250 --> 37:36.792
ABOUT WHEN YOU
WERE GONNA TELL ME

37:36.792 --> 37:38.083
IS PRETTY MUCH
OUTTA THE QUESTION
AT THIS POINT?

37:38.083 --> 37:40.500
OH, PLEASE. YOU KNOW
I LOVE BEMOANING
AFTER THE FACT.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.417
JEN, YOU JUST--
YOU GOTTA REALIZE

37:42.417 --> 37:44.250
THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND GRAMS

37:44.250 --> 37:46.333
ARE PRETTY MUCH
ALL THE FAMILY
THAT I'VE GOT.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.750
I KNOW.

37:48.750 --> 37:51.041
DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT TIME THAT I WENT
OVER TO YOUR HOUSE

37:51.041 --> 37:52.083
AFTER GRAMS KICKED ME OUT?

37:52.083 --> 37:53.333
YEAH,
HOW COULD I FORGET?

37:53.333 --> 37:54.792
THAT'S THE DAY
YOU BECAME MY HAG.

37:54.792 --> 37:57.250
NO.

37:57.250 --> 38:00.667
NO, WE'RE FAMILY.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE.

38:02.333 --> 38:05.750
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU TWO
IF YOU MAKE ME CRY TONIGHT.

38:05.750 --> 38:06.917
GRAMS...

38:06.917 --> 38:09.583
I'M SO SORRY.

38:09.583 --> 38:11.083
JACK...

38:11.083 --> 38:13.917
DON'T FEEL SORRY
FOR ME. JUST...

38:13.917 --> 38:15.792
BELIEVE IN ME, HMM?

38:15.792 --> 38:17.625
THAT'S  WHAT I NEED.

38:17.625 --> 38:20.500
WELL, I PROMISE
THAT I WILL COME
AND SEE THE TWO OF YOU

38:20.500 --> 38:22.083
EVERY CHANCE THAT I GET.

38:22.083 --> 38:23.917
OH, THAT WON'T
BE NECESSARY.

38:23.917 --> 38:26.333
OK.

38:26.333 --> 38:28.083
WELL, I MEAN,
YOU DON'T HONESTLY BELIEVE
JENNIFER AND I

38:28.083 --> 38:31.458
ARE GONNA LEAVE YOU
TO YOUR OWN QUESTIONABLE
DEVICES, DO YOU?

38:31.458 --> 38:32.834
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:32.834 --> 38:33.834
WHAT?

38:33.834 --> 38:35.542
WELL, MY DAUGHTER
SIMPLY RATTLING AROUND

38:35.542 --> 38:37.834
THAT BIG HOUSE SHE GOT
THROUGH THE DIVORCE,

38:37.834 --> 38:42.625
AND I THINK WE NEED
A MAN AROUND THE HOUSE.

38:42.625 --> 38:46.208
I MEAN, YOU'LL HAVE TO SHARE
A ROOM WITH JENNIFER--

38:46.208 --> 38:48.792
OK, GRAMS, COME ON.
I MEAN, I--I--I JUST
CAN'T, YOU KNOW,

38:48.792 --> 38:51.041
PICK UP AND--
AND LEAVE THIS PLACE.

38:51.041 --> 38:52.708
COME ON, GUYS,
I HAVE STUFF...

38:52.708 --> 38:54.792
GOING ON, YOU KNOW?
AND I MEAN, BESIDES,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO,

38:54.792 --> 38:56.959
MOOCH OFF THE TWO
OF YOU FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES?

38:56.959 --> 38:59.083
CERTAINLY NOT.
YOU'LL BE EARNING YOUR KEEP.

38:59.083 --> 39:00.667
I MEAN, WHAT'S REALLY
KEEPING YOU HERE, JACK?

39:00.667 --> 39:02.166
YES, WHAT'S REALLY
KEEPING YOU HERE, JACK?

39:02.166 --> 39:05.333
LAST I HEARD, BEANTOWN
HAD NO GREAT HOLD ON YOU.

39:05.333 --> 39:07.166
Jen: YOU CAN BE
AN APATHETIC STUDENT
ANYWHERE,

39:07.166 --> 39:08.417
AND BOSTON BAY SUCKS.

39:08.417 --> 39:10.667
YEAH, BOSTON BAY
DOES SUCK. THAT'S--

39:10.667 --> 39:13.125
THAT'S I WAY

39:13.125 --> 39:14.667
WE SHOULDA GONE

39:14.667 --> 39:17.125

SAYING IT ALL ALONG.

39:18.583 --> 39:19.750
WELL?

39:19.750 --> 39:20.750
YEAH, COME ON.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.333
THIS--THIS PLACE
DOESN'T APPRECIATE

39:22.333 --> 39:25.667
YOUR ABSOLUTELY
FABULOUS GAYNESS.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.000
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.333
WHAT DO I SAY?
WHAT--WHAT DO I SAY?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

39:29.333 --> 39:31.125
YOU SAY, UM...

39:31.125 --> 39:35.375
WELL, YOU SAY HOW I CAN
I TURN DOWN LIVING WITH
3 GENERATIONS OF CRAZIES

39:35.375 --> 39:37.583
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE?
THAT'S WHAT I SAY.

39:37.583 --> 39:38.500
(LAUGHING)

39:42.667 --> 39:43.959
YA READY FOR THIS?

39:43.959 --> 39:46.333
YES. OK, JUST DON'T

39:46.333 --> 39:47.750
ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD
OR ANYTHING, OK?

39:47.750 --> 39:51.375
COME ON, IF I'M GONNA
SELL YOU, I'VE GOTTA
EXPLOIT YOU SOMEHOW.

39:51.375 --> 39:51.917
JUST GET UP THERE.

39:51.917 --> 39:54.417
OK.

39:57.959 --> 40:01.500
SO, NEXT UP...

40:01.500 --> 40:04.291
WE HAVE A GIRL WHO'S
NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART

40:04.291 --> 40:06.500
OR AT LEAST ACROSS
FROM MY BEDROOM WINDOW.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.542
IF I HAD TO BE A WOMAN,
I'D BE AUDREY LIDDELL.

40:09.542 --> 40:10.250
SHE'S THE TOUGHEST
BLONDE I KNOW.

40:10.250 --> 40:13.083
PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.667
