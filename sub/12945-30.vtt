00:01.133 --> 00:03.667
-So, Matt and I are fighting.
-As usual.

00:03.734 --> 00:05.667
And my parents launch
into this whole discussion

00:05.734 --> 00:07.800
about how he's the only brother
I've got

00:07.867 --> 00:09.667
and we should be friends or something.

00:09.734 --> 00:13.000
Hey, at least you have Matt
to deflect some of the attention.

00:13.066 --> 00:15.200
My parents just have me to focus on.

00:15.266 --> 00:17.867
Well, my parents
are actually being cool for once.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.033
What do you mean?

00:19.100 --> 00:22.767
Well, you know how I was going to ask
if I can throw a boy/girl party?

00:22.834 --> 00:24.633
Well, they gave me the okay.

00:24.700 --> 00:28.100
What? You've been letting me
babble on about loser boy

00:28.166 --> 00:29.667
and you have big news?

00:29.734 --> 00:31.967
Priorities, woman. Priorities!

00:32.400 --> 00:35.333
And I'm totally going to need
you guys' help on planning everything.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.400
This party has to be
absolutely perfect.

00:39.066 --> 00:41.633
I am totally in. This is so cool.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.500
And the best part is,
it's not at my house with my parents.

00:44.567 --> 00:46.734
Ah, minimal parental involvement.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.633
Item one to deal with
on the party list.

00:49.133 --> 00:53.367
Okay. So, we have to have invites
and food and drinks and music.

00:53.433 --> 00:54.867
Cannot forget the music.

00:55.033 --> 00:58.266
And Britney Spears' makeup artist
and Jennifer Aniston's costumer.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.800
Oh, and don't forget
Josh Hartnett's home phone number.

01:01.333 --> 01:03.667
Hey, it's got to be
a perfect party, right?

01:03.734 --> 01:05.934
[THEME SONG PLAYING]

01:45.200 --> 01:47.900
Oh, here's the list.
Double-check that I've got everyone.

01:48.300 --> 01:51.800
Everyone? Kate? You're inviting Kate?

01:51.867 --> 01:53.100
You want her in your house?

01:53.533 --> 01:55.100
Gordo, we have to invite Kate.

01:56.066 --> 01:58.633
If we invite popular girls,
they bring popular guys.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.967
And the popular boys
attract more popular girls,

02:00.967 --> 02:03.000
who in turn attract more popular boys.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.100
It's basic math, really.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.467
So, this is what
the circle of life's all about.

02:07.533 --> 02:09.433
You want to help or not, Gordo?

02:09.500 --> 02:11.000
I'm kind of stressing here.

02:11.066 --> 02:12.867
Outside of a few
lame birthday parties,

02:12.934 --> 02:14.834
I've never thrown a party before.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.667
It's got to be flawless.

02:16.734 --> 02:18.200
Relax. Relax.

02:18.266 --> 02:20.767
Well, I made a list
of all my CDs last night.

02:20.834 --> 02:22.867
You can just check off
the ones you want,

02:22.934 --> 02:24.734
and whatever you need
after school, we'll go get it.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.667
Uh, Miranda, Larry Tudgeman's
not on your guest list.

02:27.734 --> 02:29.166
I guess I'll just add his name.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.667
No, Larry's not invited.

02:31.567 --> 02:33.500
Lizzie, you know
he would ruin the party.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.967
He probably
won't even want to come, anyway.

02:36.033 --> 02:39.266
Yeah, he'll probably brag to everyone
that he's the only one not invited.

02:40.233 --> 02:43.033
-Yeah, maybe you're right.
-I am.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.100
It just doesn't sound right to me.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.066
This week is Community Awareness Week.

02:50.367 --> 02:54.100
Community Awareness Week is about
giving back to our community,

02:54.166 --> 02:56.166
so I thought we'd try something new.

02:56.233 --> 02:59.266
Everyone will be assigned
a volunteer project.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.700
How can you assign
a volunteer project?

03:02.767 --> 03:05.867
Isn't it supposed to be voluntary?

03:05.934 --> 03:09.433
[CHUCKLES] Some people will be
working at soup kitchens,

03:10.066 --> 03:12.567
some will be working
at animal shelters,

some will be working at...

03:15.433 --> 03:19.266
"Weeping Willows Retirement Home"?

03:19.400 --> 03:22.767
You two will be
a part of their Senior Pals Program.

03:22.834 --> 03:24.900
Miss Chapman,
don't you think Matt and I should be

03:24.967 --> 03:26.767
volunteering somewhere more important?

03:27.266 --> 03:30.734
Yeah, like, you know,
building housing in Guatemala

03:30.800 --> 03:33.467
or saving the woolly spider monkey.

03:33.834 --> 03:37.200
No, I think Senior Pals
is more your speed.

03:37.266 --> 03:40.100
Mrs. Chapman, if I dump him,
can I get a better project?

03:40.166 --> 03:41.200
Hey!

03:42.467 --> 03:44.900
Here you go.
I finished them up last night.

03:44.967 --> 03:47.700
Are you sure you don't need
any more help? You look exhausted.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.100
No, I'm fine. Really.
Just help me hand these out.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.867
Here you go, Kate.

03:59.533 --> 04:01.633
-Who's invited?
-Well, everybody.

04:02.266 --> 04:04.133
And everybody starts with me?

04:04.700 --> 04:08.033
I wish everybody ended with you,
but it's Miranda's party.

04:08.100 --> 04:11.166
It's got to be perfect.
A little white lie won't hurt.

04:11.233 --> 04:13.967
Oh, of course, Kate,
we couldn't have a party without you.

04:14.033 --> 04:16.667
So you do understand
how this school works, McGuire.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.266
Maybe there's hope for you after all.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.500
I can't believe she bought that junk.

04:24.567 --> 04:27.066
Maybe I should look into
a career in acting.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.300
Hey, Ethan.

04:28.367 --> 04:30.367
Miranda, looking fine.

04:30.433 --> 04:32.300
I am? I mean, I am.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.033
I mean, thanks. This is for you.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.200
Righteous. I'll be there.

04:40.266 --> 04:41.900
I just got to ask my mom first.

04:41.967 --> 04:43.266
You do?

That's so cute.

[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]

04:53.967 --> 04:57.467
Miranda, thought I'd save you the trip
and retrieve my invite personally.

04:58.467 --> 05:01.200
Larry, I think that
Miranda accidentally

05:01.266 --> 05:02.934
left your invitation at her house.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.633
Who says I can't think on my feet?

05:06.166 --> 05:08.533
Actually, Larry, I didn't invite you.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.867
Unless, of course, my cover story
is immediately blown to pieces.

05:13.934 --> 05:16.000
I didn't think
you'd be interested in going,

05:16.066 --> 05:18.734
so, um, I saved a tree instead.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.166
Yeah, hey,

05:21.233 --> 05:23.033
that's a good idea,
and you're right, you know.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.367
I wasn't interested
in attending, anyway.

05:25.433 --> 05:29.066
But, yeah, I have
a Starfleet Command meeting, anyhow.

05:29.133 --> 05:31.800
And I just wanted
to save you the effort

05:31.867 --> 05:33.767
of having to invite me
in the first place,

05:33.834 --> 05:35.967
but, you know, you...
thought of that ahead.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.266
Miranda, I think
you really should invite him.

05:42.767 --> 05:46.066
You heard him,
he has that Starflip thingy to go to.

05:46.133 --> 05:49.433
He's cool with it.
I'm going to go catch up with Gordo.

06:03.934 --> 06:07.166
If that's totally cool, I'd hate
to see what he looks like upset.

Your Senior Pals called to say
they were running a little late,

06:12.600 --> 06:14.233

than I thought it would be.

go and pick out music.

I'm getting a stress zit.

-Hello.

Star... fleet.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.400
Yeah, that.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.333
Just ask him and get it over with.

07:56.567 --> 07:58.266
If he really doesn't want to go,

07:58.333 --> 08:00.567
then you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

08:01.100 --> 08:02.367
Larry, do you want to go

08:02.433 --> 08:04.066
-to Miranda's party?
-No.

08:04.133 --> 08:06.667
Funny, that "no"
sounds a lot like a "yes."

08:07.266 --> 08:08.200
Larry, I...

08:08.266 --> 08:10.166
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm incredibly busy.

08:12.266 --> 08:15.233
-Have you talked about food yet?
-Oh, my gosh, food.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.200
I totally spaced on food.

08:17.266 --> 08:18.967
Guys, I just talked to Tudgeman,

08:19.033 --> 08:21.633
and I think he really, really
wants to go to the party.

08:21.867 --> 08:26.100
-Well, it's good to want things.
-You know, Larry can be kind of cool.

08:26.166 --> 08:27.767
I went on a date with him last year.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.734
Remember how well that ended up?

08:29.800 --> 08:32.133
-Not helping, Gordo.
-Sorry.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.633
I just think
it's really wrong to exclude him.

08:34.767 --> 08:37.500
No, mmm-mmm, nada, absolutely not.

08:37.567 --> 08:41.066
Larry Tudgeman will not be
at my party, end of story.

08:42.767 --> 08:45.633
Come on, Lizzie. I'm already
totally freaking out as it is.

08:46.166 --> 08:49.000
Remember, we're going for perfect.
Per-fect.

-Fine.
-I knew you'd understand.

Note to self, no more parties
for Miranda.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.734
Gordo, do you remember
when you weren't invited

09:04.800 --> 09:06.166
to Danny Kessler's pool party?

09:06.767 --> 09:08.900
Yeah, I was trying
to forget about that.

09:08.967 --> 09:10.300
Thanks for bringing it up.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.700
-Didn't feel so good, did it?
-No.

09:13.233 --> 09:16.266
Well, that's exactly
what Miranda's doing to Larry.

09:17.033 --> 09:19.567
You know, I really hate it
when you're right.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.967
But being right
doesn't get Larry invited.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.934
There's nothing you can do.
I mean, it's not like...

09:25.000 --> 09:27.867
you can disguise him
and sneak him in or anything.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.100
I love having brilliant friends.

09:31.233 --> 09:33.600
Gordo, you've done it again.

09:34.266 --> 09:35.834
I don't like where this is going.

09:35.967 --> 09:38.467
Come on, Miranda cannot
get mad at us for inviting Larry

09:38.533 --> 09:39.967
if she doesn't know that it's Larry.

09:40.467 --> 09:43.166
-"Us"?
-You are going to help me, right?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.166
It's gonna be hard.

09:46.333 --> 09:50.133
First, you have to reverse
14 years of nerd evolution,

09:50.200 --> 09:52.600
and second, you gotta get him
to agree to it.

09:53.266 --> 09:56.066
-Oh, he will.
-Fine.

09:56.533 --> 09:58.567
I'll help you get Cinderfella
to the ball.

09:58.633 --> 10:02.000
I just hope Larry doesn't turn into
a pumpkin while Miranda's watching.

10:05.433 --> 10:08.033
So, what do you guys like to do?

10:08.934 --> 10:12.633
Chess? Checkers? Bingo?

two 70-year-old fifth graders.

Hey, we're just trying to find
something you like to do.

10:26.133 --> 10:29.333
Yeah, we could be out having fun.

10:29.667 --> 10:32.400
Fun? You wouldn't know fun
if it came up,

10:32.467 --> 10:34.700
introduced herself
and did the can-can.

-I like the can-can.
-Shut up.

-What's a "can-can"?
-Shut up.

We're very happy to meet you.

10:55.633 --> 10:57.033
Wonderful kids you've got here.

10:57.100 --> 11:00.700
Thank you. Kids, would you like
your new pals to stay for dinner?

11:00.767 --> 11:03.066
-What are you having?
-[LOUDLY] Um, my...

11:03.133 --> 11:05.433
[SOFTLY] ...my world-famous
beef stroganoff.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.934
Actually, I'm allergic to stroganoff.
I'm deathly allergic.

11:11.033 --> 11:12.700
Oh. What a shame.

11:12.767 --> 11:15.400
We could take the kids
off your hands for dinner.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.066
We rarely get visitors.
Let's roll, guys.

11:20.633 --> 11:24.900
You know, there is something
vaguely familiar about those two.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.500
Nobody's allergic to stroganoff.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.033
-Hey, Larry.
-What's up?

11:30.100 --> 11:32.066
I don't have time for idle chitchat.

11:32.133 --> 11:33.700
Trek-a-thon starts in ten minutes.

11:33.767 --> 11:36.033
Larry, if Miranda knew how much
going to the party meant to you,
