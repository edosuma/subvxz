WEBVTT

00:19.041 --> 00:19.916
You're up early.

00:20.833 --> 00:24.250
Yeah. Trying to get us a head start,
but it's playing hard to get.

00:25.583 --> 00:28.833
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?

00:31.416 --> 00:35.583
Don't worry about the skull. We've already
got a head start on Kipps' crew.

00:35.666 --> 00:39.333
We'll be in and out of the cemetery
before they even finish their cornflakes.

00:39.416 --> 00:40.250
Juice?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.541
What if it meant the mirror?

00:44.000 --> 00:44.833
What?

00:44.916 --> 00:49.458
The skull. Right? It said death is coming.
What if the mirror is death?

00:50.291 --> 00:51.541
Then I say bring it on.

00:52.041 --> 00:54.208
-Nothing we can't handle together.

00:54.291 --> 00:57.708
-I'll go back to bed then, shall I?
-I meant all of us.

01:00.375 --> 01:03.916
There's no time for that.
You can grab one en route to the archives.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.041
I thought we were going to the cemetery?

01:06.125 --> 01:07.500
<i>We </i>are. Come on.

01:08.083 --> 01:09.791
I need you to go down to the archives

01:09.875 --> 01:12.791
and find out everything you can
about the mirror and Bickerstaff.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.000
Today is make or break.

01:14.083 --> 01:16.916
Only 'cause you turned this job
into a pissing contest.

01:17.708 --> 01:19.250
Not still in a mood about that, are you?

01:19.333 --> 01:22.083
Did you forget what we went through
to save this place?

01:22.166 --> 01:24.708
If I tell my parents I've lost another job
because you and Kipps--

01:24.791 --> 01:26.625
-We won't lose.
-Won't we?

01:26.708 --> 01:28.333
How do you know? Are you psychic?

01:28.416 --> 01:30.666
You're telling me I don't have time
to drink a coffee.

01:30.750 --> 01:33.791
-Let alone assess the crime scene.
-Okay. Enough.

01:33.875 --> 01:38.625
George, come with us. Suss out the scene,
then go to the archives, work your magic.

01:38.708 --> 01:39.750
And, Lockwood.

01:40.583 --> 01:41.541
Make an effort.

01:42.125 --> 01:43.750
Give him two quid for a coffee.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.458
Oh, shit.

01:59.166 --> 02:00.458
There goes our edge.

02:04.583 --> 02:05.666
Afternoon, Tony.

02:06.791 --> 02:08.541
Piss off, Kipps. We're busy.

02:09.125 --> 02:11.833
Kat and I were just wondering,
when you lose this case

02:11.916 --> 02:15.833
and your little mates
have to crawl under their rocks,

02:16.416 --> 02:19.791
what are you gonna do by yourself
in that big, empty house of yours?

02:19.875 --> 02:21.083
Breaks my heart.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.083
Hmm.

02:24.041 --> 02:26.166
-Just ignore them.
-We'll show them.

02:28.291 --> 02:29.958
But we'll get more when we come…

02:33.375 --> 02:34.958
How's the head today, Ms. Joplin?

02:35.041 --> 02:37.791
It's fine, just a bump.
Nothing compared with this mess.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.958
We were on the brink
of a major discovery with that mirror.

02:41.041 --> 02:43.958
I told you we needed more than one child
on that door, and regular checks--

02:44.041 --> 02:46.666
Mr. Kipps thinks
that this is an inside job.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.666
It's unusual for relic men
to swoop in so fast.

02:49.750 --> 02:53.083
The little shit on guard must have tipped
them off that this was something special.

02:53.166 --> 02:55.125
The little shit who got knocked out?

02:55.208 --> 02:57.291
This is why we have insurance.

02:57.375 --> 03:00.666
And now DEPRAC's suspended
all activity in the cemetery,

03:00.750 --> 03:03.416
we shall be raking in the compensation.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.750
It's not about the money.
It's a unique artifact.

03:06.833 --> 03:08.166
Will you can it, Pam?

03:08.833 --> 03:10.125
It's just a stupid relic.

03:10.208 --> 03:11.500
It's really not.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.291
We'll just take a look inside.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.458
Now, what else
can I assist you with?

03:19.541 --> 03:20.916
Kipps is wrong.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.250
Night Watch know better than to mess
with dangerous relics and relic men.

03:24.333 --> 03:27.666
Given how valuable this is, there had
to have been at least two of them.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.166
Agreed.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.125
How do we think they got in here
without being seen?

03:32.208 --> 03:36.291
Well, the main gates were well guarded,
and DEPRAC confirm that door was locked.

03:36.791 --> 03:37.875
What's this?

03:39.708 --> 03:42.666
-It's a Tendy's badge.
-An agent did this?

03:43.375 --> 03:45.333
Agents in league with relic men?

03:45.416 --> 03:48.958
Or agents on their own, knowing
everyone will think it's relic men.

03:49.541 --> 03:52.041
-Now this is getting interesting.
-Glad I came?

03:52.125 --> 03:55.958
Ecstatic. We've got our edge back.
Now let's make it count.

03:57.458 --> 03:59.583
George, we need you
back at the archives now.

04:01.791 --> 04:02.750
George?

04:04.875 --> 04:06.000
-George.
-Huh?

04:07.041 --> 04:10.375
It's time to go. Bobby Vernon
will have been on this since dawn.

04:10.458 --> 04:13.375
You do know Bobby Vernon
can just push a button on his database?

04:13.458 --> 04:15.208
Yeah, but where's the fun in that?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.333
<i>What's up with him?</i>

04:18.916 --> 04:21.750
<i>He's got the hump because</i>
<i>he'd rather be where the action is,</i>

04:21.833 --> 04:24.500
<i>but he's our researcher,</i>
<i>and that's what I need him to do.</i>

04:25.000 --> 04:26.958
<i>He'll be fine… he'll be fine…</i>

04:27.625 --> 04:29.291
<i>So, what now?</i>

04:30.958 --> 04:33.791
Role-play. Let's imagine
we're a couple of relic men.

04:33.875 --> 04:36.875
How are we getting in and out
of this cemetery without being seen?

04:36.958 --> 04:38.833
Probably over the wall, by the canal.

04:38.916 --> 04:41.875
The water makes it safer,
and it's well away from the main gate,

04:41.958 --> 04:45.625
so if I had to knock anyone out,
no one would hear them scream.

04:45.708 --> 04:48.166
Alarming how quickly
you got into character.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.916
Come on, before anyone else
has the same idea.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.958
George, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be at the archive.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.416
Look. In the water.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.375
I know him.

06:58.041 --> 07:01.166
Danny Clough was one
of the older agents when I was starting.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
He helped me out.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.166
Got me out of trouble a few times.

07:07.083 --> 07:10.041
He was one of those people
who had no idea how cool he was.

07:11.666 --> 07:13.375
How did he go from that to…

07:15.875 --> 07:17.000
a relic man?

07:19.500 --> 07:20.416
I'm sorry.

07:22.416 --> 07:26.708
Let's keep this to ourselves.
We need to find out who his partner was.

07:26.791 --> 07:29.791
We dredged the whole stretch. No mirror.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.041
Any idea who the body is?

07:32.125 --> 07:34.916
Working on it. Going off the tattoos,
definitely a relic man.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.833
Who do you think did that to him?
His eyes, I mean?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.291
No one.

07:40.583 --> 07:42.875
We found ocular tissue
under his fingernails.

07:42.958 --> 07:44.666
And injury suggests it's his own.

07:44.750 --> 07:47.250
What he saw in that mirror
made him do that to himself.

07:47.333 --> 07:51.166
You need to make a breakthrough.
If that thing gets into the wrong hands…

07:52.125 --> 07:53.750
We won't let you down.

08:01.958 --> 08:05.916
Fittes will go wide. They'll round up
every relic man until they find something.

08:06.416 --> 08:08.333
We need to move faster. Smarter.

08:08.958 --> 08:12.083
-George.
-Archives, I know. What about you two?

08:12.166 --> 08:14.166
No time to explain.
I'll fill you in later.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.000
Meet you at the house at midnight
for an epic breakfast.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.708
Are you sure you're all right?
About Danny?

08:22.791 --> 08:25.666
-I hardly knew him.
-It could still stir stuff up.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.708
I know someone who can help us.
An old friend, works on the river.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.166
Come on.

08:39.541 --> 08:41.500
-One day pass, please.
-We're full.

08:42.083 --> 08:43.250
Oh, um…

08:45.333 --> 08:46.916
Well, look, I won't take up much room.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.750
-It's for a case. I'm doing research.
-Not today, you're not.

08:51.125 --> 08:54.166
-Please. This is important.
-Then you should have come earlier.

08:55.750 --> 08:56.791
Oh, forget it.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.791
Mr. Karim.

09:12.291 --> 09:16.291
I'd ask what brings you here,
but I think I can guess. Bickerstaff?

09:16.375 --> 09:19.000
Yeah, but I was just leaving.
They're full.

09:19.083 --> 09:23.041
Well, you know I'm on the board?
I'm not averse to pulling a string or two.

09:23.541 --> 09:27.416
-Our little secret. Come on.
-Really? You're a lifesaver.

09:28.708 --> 09:31.000
-What are you here for?
-Comfort.

09:31.583 --> 09:33.291
This place calms me down.

09:33.916 --> 09:34.833
Me too.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.333
I hope they still work this patch.
It's been a while.

09:46.416 --> 09:50.833
Who? Relic men? Don't you think they'll
be in hiding, with Fittes all over town?

09:50.916 --> 09:53.125
Probably.
This one's a bit different, though.

09:53.208 --> 09:55.458
What? Not an evil, thieving bastard, then?

09:55.541 --> 10:00.958
Hey, we badly need her help,
so just… try and be nice, yeah?

10:01.041 --> 10:02.416
When am I not nice?

10:02.916 --> 10:04.583
-Wait.

10:05.291 --> 10:06.125
Her?

10:11.333 --> 10:12.750
Did you… did you hear that?

10:37.583 --> 10:39.125
Who left you out here?

10:42.750 --> 10:44.750
-Oh!

10:56.333 --> 10:57.541
Run!

10:58.375 --> 10:59.708
Cold Maiden!

11:01.291 --> 11:02.666
Lockwood!

11:16.833 --> 11:17.791
What happened?

11:18.291 --> 11:19.166
I did.

11:20.583 --> 11:21.958
Evening, Locky.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.208
Who's the latest slapper?

11:24.875 --> 11:25.708
'Scuse me?

11:26.250 --> 11:28.708
This is my associate, Lucy Carlyle.

11:29.208 --> 11:32.458
Lucy, meet Florence Bonnard.
AKA Flo Bones.

11:32.541 --> 11:34.375
The best relic hunter on the Thames.

11:36.916 --> 11:40.708
Cheers for distracting her, Locky.
Took me a while to locate her remains.

11:40.791 --> 11:42.333
Always happy to help you out, Flo.

11:42.416 --> 11:46.166
We could've been dead by the time you got
off your arse. No way you didn't hear us.

11:46.250 --> 11:49.458
No point trying to outrun a Cold Maiden.
Any idiot knows that.

11:49.541 --> 11:51.541
Gotta find the source or you're screwed.

11:51.625 --> 11:54.333
-Especially if you're a bit…
-What?

11:54.416 --> 11:56.375
-Wet.
-Uh… who was she?

11:58.166 --> 11:59.250
Elisabeth Creevey.

11:59.833 --> 12:01.333
Victorian baby farmer.

12:01.916 --> 12:04.958
Single mums paid her to have their kids
adopted into good homes,

12:05.041 --> 12:07.666
but she kept the cash, drowned the kids.

12:08.416 --> 12:11.666
These relics have bad vibes
I can charge a fortune for.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.791
-Pay my way for months.
-You're sick.

12:15.416 --> 12:17.750
We all make our living
dealing with the dead.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.625
Only difference is
you're caught in the cogs.

12:20.708 --> 12:22.583
Slaves to a system run by the rich.

12:22.666 --> 12:25.166
-Oh God!
-At least I'm free.

12:27.708 --> 12:28.708
Bullshit.

12:33.416 --> 12:36.041
Well, we make things safe.
And relic men are evil.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.708
-And relic girls--
-Girl, actually.

12:38.791 --> 12:41.541
-I'm the only one. My own boss.
-It's nothing to be proud of.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.541
-Nothing to be ashamed of neither.

12:43.625 --> 12:45.916
Look, love, this river's filled
with the ghosts

12:46.000 --> 12:48.416
of men who've been murdering
since this city was made.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.791
Almost all the girl ghosts
are their victims.

12:50.875 --> 12:53.583
The only reason these are worth anything
is 'cause she was so rare.

12:53.666 --> 12:56.541
Oh, wow, a female serial killer.

12:56.625 --> 13:00.166
Whoo! Aspirational. Why don't you stick it
on a T-shirt? Jesus, can we just go?

13:00.250 --> 13:03.625
The world that made women
give their babies away, that's the evil.

13:04.125 --> 13:05.333
And it never ends.

13:06.958 --> 13:08.125
Hold on, hold on. Flo.

13:09.625 --> 13:10.833
-I know a buyer.
-Lockwood!

13:10.916 --> 13:12.708
It's the Foundling Museum.

13:12.791 --> 13:16.083
They'll pay more than the black market,
and it's a good home. A safe one.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.833
And get arrested for my trouble?
No, thanks.

13:18.916 --> 13:21.208
Not if you're anonymous
and I'm the intermediary.

13:24.916 --> 13:26.541
What a nice boy you are, Locky.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.875
Helps to be born minted, of course.

13:29.958 --> 13:33.291
And in return, you tell us
what you know about Danny Clough.

13:34.958 --> 13:36.375
What's happened to Danny?

13:57.250 --> 13:58.708
-Mr. Karim?

13:59.500 --> 14:01.375
It's past curfew. We should go.

14:03.708 --> 14:04.750
Get what you needed?

14:06.291 --> 14:10.000
-I've made a start, thanks to you.
-I was glad to be of help.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.000
Any fun plans for the evening?

14:13.083 --> 14:15.791
Absolutely. I was thinking
I could clean the oven.

14:15.875 --> 14:16.750
-Again.

14:18.041 --> 14:22.375
Well, I only live around the corner
if you'd like to get something to eat?

14:22.958 --> 14:24.291
You must be starving.

14:25.791 --> 14:28.333
-Unless your friends are expecting you?
-Uh--

14:29.041 --> 14:30.708
No. I'd… I'd love to.

14:32.041 --> 14:32.875
Great.

15:00.583 --> 15:04.125
Poor Cloughy. He asked me out once.
Been drinking, obviously.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.333
It's not "obviously."

15:05.416 --> 15:09.333
Yes, obviously. He was always drinking.
That's how they would have got to him.

15:09.416 --> 15:11.916
-Who?
-Parasites. Scum.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.625
Why didn't Tendy's help him?
He must've worked for them for years.

15:14.708 --> 15:16.000
Tendy's doesn't give a shit.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.000
He was on his way out.
Talent fading. Expendable.

15:19.083 --> 15:22.541
We need to find Danny's partner.
Whoever it was who left him for dead.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.125
That'll be Jack Carver.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.833
But you do not wanna find him. Trust me.

15:27.625 --> 15:28.958
We have to.

15:29.041 --> 15:31.166
This is important, Flo. Please.

15:33.541 --> 15:36.625
Leave a message on that board,
and he might come and find you.

15:36.708 --> 15:39.000
It'll have to be
the right kind of message, though.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.375
One he can't ignore.

15:47.916 --> 15:49.541
"We know about the mirror."

15:50.708 --> 15:52.791
And our address? That is a suicide note!

15:52.875 --> 15:55.958
We need to make sure he shows up.
He's our only hope.

16:06.458 --> 16:09.625
Tell me about their network.
How do they move their goods?

16:09.708 --> 16:11.416
They're in business with Julius Winkman.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.250
Antiques dealer in Bermondsey
who works with his wife.

16:14.333 --> 16:17.541
-I'm warning you, do not poke that nest.
-What do you mean?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.250
Let me put it more plainly, darling.
If Carver doesn't kill you, they will.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.000
Thanks, Flo. Here.

16:30.083 --> 16:33.041
Something to remember Danny by.
The way he was.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.625
I'm always surprised
when you turn up to see me, Locky.

16:48.916 --> 16:50.791
I thought you'd be dead by now.

17:06.208 --> 17:09.750
I see you're a big fan of Thoth.
He's a god of the dead, right?

17:09.833 --> 17:13.458
You're the first guest I've had
who's known his name.

17:13.541 --> 17:17.125
-It's written on the base.
-Yeah, but you pronounced it correctly.

17:17.208 --> 17:20.666
He's the god of writing, science,
and wisdom. And the dead.

17:21.333 --> 17:24.291
Right. But much less so than, say, Rashnu.

17:25.791 --> 17:28.041
The Persian righteous judge of the dead.

17:28.541 --> 17:31.500
The angel who stands on the bridge
between our world and the next,

17:31.583 --> 17:34.833
sending souls to the House of Lies
or the House of Song.

17:34.916 --> 17:36.666
Well, now you're just showing off.

17:37.250 --> 17:41.333
You wouldn't believe how nice it feels to
have someone to show off to, Ms. Joplin.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.208
Call me Pamela.

17:44.083 --> 17:46.750
-<i>So what were you studying today?</i>

17:46.833 --> 17:51.041
My specialist subject,
the early years of the Problem.

17:51.750 --> 17:53.416
Well, that's my subject too.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.375
-Oh!
-Do you have any theories?

17:55.458 --> 17:57.083
Any mistakes? Cover-ups?

17:57.166 --> 17:59.750
Do you think anyone had any clue
what they were doing?

17:59.833 --> 18:03.458
It's not about conspiracy theories
or alternate history for me.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.958
It's… it's mainly nostalgia.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.583
But you weren't around before the Problem.

18:09.666 --> 18:11.916
-The correct response! No, I wasn't.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.166
But when I was young,
it was all still relatively new.

18:15.250 --> 18:18.125
So your parents remembered
how things were, I mean?

18:18.208 --> 18:23.000
Well, they tried to hang on to that world,
which was obviously impossible.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.000
It must've been kind of amazing for them,

18:25.083 --> 18:27.708
realizing you had these skills
that could keep them safe.

18:28.666 --> 18:30.208
Oh, I never had any talent.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.500
Uh… None at all?

18:32.583 --> 18:33.958
Not the slightest bit.

18:34.583 --> 18:38.250
I would have loved to have experienced
what you have with your friends.

18:39.208 --> 18:42.041
But it spurred me on to learn more.

18:45.083 --> 18:45.916
Pamela.

18:48.208 --> 18:51.291
When we looked into that mirror,
did you see something?

18:54.208 --> 18:55.916
-Did you?

18:57.041 --> 18:59.625
Well, not really. It was so quick. But…

19:01.625 --> 19:02.875
I felt like…

19:05.083 --> 19:07.250
-I can't describe it, but…

19:09.500 --> 19:10.875
like I wanted to see more.

19:12.041 --> 19:14.750
-Do you feel that too?
-Yes, of course.

19:17.541 --> 19:19.291
But I think I've always felt that..

19:25.125 --> 19:29.791
Listen, I should probably head home now,
in case anyone notices I'm not there.

19:30.416 --> 19:32.125
Unlikely, but you never know.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.500
Shouldn't we get a cab home?

19:36.583 --> 19:39.750
-It's such a lovely evening for a stroll.
-Said no one ever.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.875
-So, how did you meet Flo?
-Can't remember. Ages ago.

19:45.958 --> 19:48.791
-She always been like that?
-Yeah. Bless her.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.041
She cares about you, doesn't she?

19:52.125 --> 19:53.583
Yeah, she's a worrier, that's all.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.416
Forget about it. We don't know how long
it will be until Carver gets that message.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.625
We need to move fast.

20:00.125 --> 20:03.291
-I did say we should get a cab.
-We're not headed back yet, though.

20:03.375 --> 20:05.083
It's almost midnight.
George will wait up.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.416
George will be delighted
when we bring the mirror.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.666
No, not… not Winkman's?

20:10.458 --> 20:11.708
You heard what Barnes said.

20:11.791 --> 20:15.458
That thing is lethal. Who knows
whose hands it could end up in tomorrow?

20:15.958 --> 20:18.583
Plus, it's easier to break in
and steal things at night.

20:18.666 --> 20:19.875
And it's on our way.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.458
She said they'd kill us.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.416
You heard her.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.541
Yeah, but Flo's a worrier.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.416
I'm not worried. Are you?

20:49.833 --> 20:53.291
We'll never get in there.
Let's come back first thing.

20:53.375 --> 20:56.125
-You can pretend to be a customer--
-Let's go down the side.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.958
Ah. That's more like it.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.291
I don't like this.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.500
Can you hear the mirror?

21:57.458 --> 22:01.875
There's too many sounds. Like--
Like the airways are jammed with signals.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.625
From all this.

22:26.458 --> 22:27.583
They're relics.

22:29.125 --> 22:30.625
Still got psychic charge.

22:31.916 --> 22:33.666
Bad history hanging about.

22:35.875 --> 22:36.708
Come on.

22:37.666 --> 22:38.916
Let's get further in.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.333
See if you can hear it.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.125
-Wait a minute. Wait.

22:52.125 --> 22:52.958
Is that it?

22:53.750 --> 22:54.583
No.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.125
No, that's something living. We should go.

22:58.208 --> 22:59.541
-Or hide.

23:00.083 --> 23:00.916
You're right.

23:01.833 --> 23:03.500
-It sounds mechanical.

23:04.333 --> 23:05.583
There's no footsteps.

23:07.291 --> 23:08.666
If anyone comes, hide.

23:09.666 --> 23:10.791
Lockwood.

23:18.958 --> 23:20.208
Hello.

23:20.291 --> 23:22.750
-<i>Uh… Danger, danger.</i>

23:30.500 --> 23:32.458
I'm here because I've lost something.

23:33.833 --> 23:36.458
Do you think
you could help me find it, please?

23:37.416 --> 23:38.583
It's a mirror.

23:39.291 --> 23:40.625
A very special mirror.

23:41.583 --> 23:42.958
It makes a buzzing sound.

23:44.625 --> 23:45.500
Like a bee.

23:48.916 --> 23:51.083
Have you heard it round here?

23:54.916 --> 23:56.291
Do you think you could show me?

23:56.375 --> 23:58.333
Didn't I tell you
not to talk to strangers?

23:58.416 --> 23:59.500
Ah, you must be--

24:03.708 --> 24:05.875
Leopold, go and get your father.

25:18.416 --> 25:19.875
Oh…

25:43.958 --> 25:45.458
Which agency are you from?

25:46.791 --> 25:48.583
I don't recognize the uniform.

25:49.375 --> 25:50.375
I'm not an agent.

25:51.875 --> 25:54.250
I'm a burglar. You should call the police.

25:54.750 --> 25:56.125
You had a rapier.

25:56.833 --> 26:01.083
And no criminal would be so foolish
as to try to burglarize my premises.

26:01.166 --> 26:02.083
Fair enough.

26:03.791 --> 26:04.833
I'm undercover.

26:05.708 --> 26:06.750
From Fittes.

26:07.958 --> 26:09.916
Call DEPRAC and report me.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.750
Fittes have already been
by today. During opening hours.

26:14.333 --> 26:15.875
Civilized callers.

26:17.291 --> 26:18.458
Unlike yourself.

26:20.375 --> 26:23.000
I don't think I need trouble DEPRAC.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.791
Come on now, Mr. Winkman.
There's no need for that.

26:28.416 --> 26:31.250
I'm sure we can come
to some form of arrangement.

26:31.333 --> 26:35.000
I have access
to some extremely valuable antiques.

26:37.708 --> 26:42.333
I'm guessing that you're after
the same item that Fittes was. Am I right?

26:44.208 --> 26:45.958
So, tell me…

26:47.250 --> 26:48.666
who you are,

26:49.750 --> 26:52.458
and who told you to come here.

26:53.416 --> 26:59.083
Or shall I draw some pretty pictures
on your pretty little face?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.958
If you do that, you'll have to kill me.

27:03.458 --> 27:05.625
You wouldn't get away
with killing an agent.

27:10.958 --> 27:11.875
Maybe.

27:13.041 --> 27:13.958
Yeah.

27:17.458 --> 27:18.583
But then again…

27:21.291 --> 27:23.041
a certain type of young man

27:23.125 --> 27:26.833
has always been susceptible
to a certain kind of… end.

27:27.541 --> 27:30.583
Introspective. Educated.

27:30.666 --> 27:32.666
Burdened by the business of death.

27:34.625 --> 27:38.083
If your wrists were slashed
with your own knife,

27:38.875 --> 27:40.375
would anyone think twice?

27:41.083 --> 27:42.083
Yeah, they would.

27:42.916 --> 27:43.958
My friends would.

27:44.958 --> 27:48.166
Okay, then.
Well, let's start with that, then.

27:51.458 --> 27:53.708
Who else knows that you're here?

27:55.375 --> 27:56.208
No one.

27:56.833 --> 27:58.291
No one?

28:01.666 --> 28:03.583
Look…

28:03.666 --> 28:05.958
It's true, I'm sorry.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.791
I swear it's true.

28:08.500 --> 28:11.500
I always work alone.
Go on, ask me another question.

28:12.583 --> 28:13.875
Okay!

28:19.416 --> 28:21.625
-Bam, bam, bam, bam!

28:22.208 --> 28:23.625
-Bam!

28:23.708 --> 28:26.750
-Dum, dum, dum…

28:26.833 --> 28:28.250
Da!

28:30.166 --> 28:32.291
Who else knows…

28:33.625 --> 28:36.666
…that you are here?

29:14.166 --> 29:15.375
Oh, come on.

29:23.666 --> 29:24.958
Leopold, is it?

29:26.958 --> 29:28.208
I know it's in there.

29:29.375 --> 29:30.291
The mirror.

29:32.541 --> 29:33.958
Is it keeping you awake?

29:37.958 --> 29:39.000
You're talented.

29:40.250 --> 29:41.750
I'm a listener too.

29:41.833 --> 29:43.041
Is that your toy?

29:44.041 --> 29:45.166
Can I listen to it?

29:58.250 --> 29:59.500
You're hurting.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.333
My friend is really hurting.

30:05.458 --> 30:06.958
Do you know where he is?

30:09.958 --> 30:12.000
Do you think you could
help me find him, Leopold?

30:13.083 --> 30:13.916
Please.

30:15.125 --> 30:16.500
-What is it?

30:25.375 --> 30:26.833
Did she tell you anything?

30:28.166 --> 30:31.833
I didn't give her the chance.
But she's a nosy one. A listener.

30:32.541 --> 30:33.833
She knows where it is.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.666
Your colleague, I presume?

30:36.750 --> 30:38.708
Never seen her before in my life.

30:40.666 --> 30:44.250
Leopold, go back to bed and stay there.

30:44.333 --> 30:46.958
Let him watch.
If he won't do as he's told,

30:47.041 --> 30:49.208
he might as well learn
how the world works.

30:52.166 --> 30:53.416
Leave her alone.

30:54.916 --> 30:57.291
She's just a trainee.
She doesn't know anything.

30:58.375 --> 31:00.458
Oh, so she's more than a colleague, then.

31:01.166 --> 31:02.166
Is she a friend?

31:02.875 --> 31:05.291
-Is she family?
-She's no one. Let her go.

31:08.291 --> 31:09.666
Ohh!

31:11.250 --> 31:12.916
Well, a suicide pact it is, then.

31:14.666 --> 31:15.750
It's perfect.

31:19.500 --> 31:22.583
Fine. Fine. I'll tell you everything.

31:23.166 --> 31:26.000
You're right. No one will be surprised
if I turn up dead.

31:26.666 --> 31:28.333
They've all been waiting for it.

31:28.416 --> 31:31.541
So put me out of <i>my </i>misery, by all means,
but just let her go.

31:32.333 --> 31:33.875
She's got everything to live for,

31:33.958 --> 31:36.416
and she will not breathe a word of this,
I swear.

31:37.375 --> 31:40.291
Winkman, listen to me.
Look, I'm… I'm serious. I mean it.

31:40.791 --> 31:44.750
Do what you want with me. I don't care.
No tricks. No lies.

31:46.875 --> 31:48.000
Do we have a deal?

31:58.375 --> 32:01.625
I'll kill her last,
so you don't have to watch.

32:03.791 --> 32:06.375
You're getting soft,
Julius, my love.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.083
-You could be right.

32:08.833 --> 32:09.791
Leopold, move!

32:14.375 --> 32:17.458
Take one step and I throw it.

32:18.166 --> 32:19.833
-Do not test me!
-No, Julius!

32:26.625 --> 32:28.666
-I'm coming for you, boy.

32:29.958 --> 32:32.583
I'm gonna gut you. I'm gonna mince you.

32:32.666 --> 32:34.833
And I'm gonna tear your skin off!

32:36.291 --> 32:37.791
You'd better run, boy!

32:37.875 --> 32:39.541
I'm gonna count to ten!

32:40.291 --> 32:41.125
One!

32:41.625 --> 32:42.458
Two!

33:33.166 --> 33:35.166
Oh--

33:38.458 --> 33:39.625
What the hell was that?

33:40.250 --> 33:42.708
Flo was right. Total psychos.

33:42.791 --> 33:46.875
Not them. You. You were practically
begging him to kill you.

33:48.666 --> 33:52.041
-I prefer to call it a noble sacrifice.
-Oh, don't give me that shit.

33:52.125 --> 33:53.791
If I hadn't come to, you'd be dead.

33:54.708 --> 33:57.041
That's… that's not true. I had a plan.

33:57.833 --> 34:00.541
Oh. Oh, okay, right.
What… what was that, then?

34:05.166 --> 34:08.041
You know, I would've had a plan,
if it had come to it.

34:09.166 --> 34:10.916
In the moment, I always do.

34:14.125 --> 34:16.000
-What is going on with you?

34:19.625 --> 34:21.375
You know you can talk to me, Lockwood.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.708
Yeah… yeah.

34:24.416 --> 34:25.541
Yeah, I know.

34:28.041 --> 34:29.791
-So?

34:35.750 --> 34:39.208
God's sake. I don't even know
why I bother. Come on. Let's just go.

34:43.708 --> 34:46.083
I'm never going back there.
They can keep the mirror.

34:46.166 --> 34:48.375
-You saw where it was?
-Locked up.

34:48.458 --> 34:50.250
Probably move it,
now their cover's been blown.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.500
We can't let Winkman and Carver
get away with this.

34:52.583 --> 34:53.416
Oh shit.

34:54.541 --> 34:55.375
What?

34:56.125 --> 34:59.541
Carver. He'll have got your note
and George is home alone.

35:00.541 --> 35:01.750
Now we get a cab.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.666
-You said midnight!

35:17.750 --> 35:20.416
-You didn't wait up, did you?
-Of course. Where's the mirror?

35:20.500 --> 35:22.916
-What the hell have you been doing?
-I'll tell you later.

35:25.333 --> 35:26.333
Who's that?

35:41.375 --> 35:42.208
It's Carver.

35:42.833 --> 35:44.708
-Who's Carver?
-Danny's partner.

35:59.750 --> 36:00.916
Oh my God.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.583
-Lucy, call an ambulance now.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.458
Jesus. Who did this to you?

36:10.958 --> 36:14.166
-Bone glass.
-What did he say?

36:14.666 --> 36:17.666
Bone glass? What does that--
What does that mean?

36:17.750 --> 36:18.875
Is that the mirror?

36:19.583 --> 36:22.250
Seven. Not one.

36:22.333 --> 36:23.708
Seven what?

36:24.416 --> 36:25.666
Did you look into it?

36:27.875 --> 36:28.916
What did you see?

36:30.958 --> 36:33.500
Terrible things.

36:37.083 --> 36:39.291
Come with me.

36:40.125 --> 36:42.208
Where? Where… where to?

36:42.916 --> 36:44.875
-Huh? What did you hear?
-He--

36:46.958 --> 36:48.666
He wants us to go with him.

36:49.875 --> 36:50.833
Lucy.

36:52.708 --> 36:53.750
He's dead.
