WEBVTT

00:05.505 --> 00:08.508
Chef salad, honey,
mustard on the side.

00:08.591 --> 00:10.343
Wait. You know
what I really want?

00:10.427 --> 00:11.761
Barbecue beef sandwich.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.973
- Okay. Barbecue beef.
- Wait, barbecue beef?

00:15.056 --> 00:16.725
Two minutes ago, you were
in the mood for a salad.

00:16.808 --> 00:17.934
I changed my mind.

00:18.017 --> 00:20.395
Let me explain
what just happened.

00:20.478 --> 00:21.938
See, she likes the salad.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.649
She doesn't love the salad

00:24.733 --> 00:26.276
but she cares for it a lot.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.820
And, uh, then she saw
the barbecue beef

00:28.903 --> 00:32.448
and it was all hot
and saucy and muscular

00:32.531 --> 00:34.367
and then she started
to develop some feelings..

00:34.451 --> 00:37.203
[laughing]

00:37.287 --> 00:38.955
That's funny.
I like that.

00:39.038 --> 00:40.665
I like how you turned
you into the salad

00:40.749 --> 00:42.459
and Vince into
the barbecue beef.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.002
That's funny, huh?

00:44.085 --> 00:45.295
You know, I guess
now that we're friends

00:45.378 --> 00:48.131
we can do funny stuff
like that.

00:48.214 --> 00:51.468
How much longer are you going to
be doing funny stuff like that?

00:51.551 --> 00:54.012
Hard to say, but I would like
to point out that the salad

00:54.095 --> 00:55.346
is going to an ivy league school

00:55.430 --> 00:57.640
while the beef rides
a bike for a living.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.059
Alright, I got to go,
don't wanna be

01:00.143 --> 01:01.227
late for my first day at work.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.687
Look at you, all getting a job

01:02.771 --> 01:04.313
at one of the coolest
stores in the city.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.649
Hey, I know, I mean, I just
walked in to get a shirt

01:06.733 --> 01:07.984
and the manager
took one look at me

01:08.067 --> 01:09.569
and hired me right on the spot.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.322
They must have a rule that they
only hire good-looking people.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.407
You know what I mean?

01:14.491 --> 01:16.117
Peace.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.494
I got to go too.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.038
Hey, uh, listen,
don't read anything into this

01:20.121 --> 01:23.374
but the salad
has been working out.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.709
Oh, yeah.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.173
[chuckles]
Look at you two,
being all friends and stuff.

01:30.256 --> 01:33.968
Ooh, now is the perfect
time to go after Vince.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.512
Well, I mean.
That was the deal, right?

01:35.595 --> 01:37.055
You were going to wait
until the time was right?

01:37.138 --> 01:39.098
Well, hello, the time
is right. Come on.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.850
You've waited, like, a month.
How long are you gonna wait?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.811
Listen, Vince and I
want to be together

01:42.894 --> 01:44.395
but Henry means a lot
to the both of us.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.482
I mean, if it takes
six months, a year, two years..

01:47.565 --> 01:48.775
I know how you can do it sooner.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.902
Thank God! How?

01:50.985 --> 01:53.112
Get Henry a girlfriend.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.533
Now tell me again,
but less dumb.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.785
No, dumb? It's brilliant.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.829
You get Henry a girlfriend,
he's all happy

02:00.912 --> 02:02.372
and you and Vince
are good to go.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.375
No, that's manipulative,
creepy and weird.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.835
So, what, you're just
not going to do anything?

02:06.918 --> 02:08.419
Yes, I'm going to do
everything I can

02:08.502 --> 02:10.170
to get Vince out of my mind.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.090
- Here's your salad.
- Oh, no, I ordered Vince.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.769
- Where's Gary?
- Oh, I knew it.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.438
He was totally lying
about working here.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.148
No, his manager said
he's in the back

03:10.231 --> 03:12.734
getting ready for his shift.

03:12.817 --> 03:16.529
Oh, my God. Look at that
gorgeous flat belly.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.406
I need to touch it.
You, come here. I'm touching it.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.158
- Quit it.
- Val, you do look good in that.

03:20.241 --> 03:23.328
- You should get it.
- Oh, no, I shouldn't.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.039
I can't believe I let you
talk me into trying this on.

03:26.122 --> 03:30.543
Look at this place. The clothes,
the posters, it's all about sex.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.378
So?

03:32.462 --> 03:35.548
So it's offensive.
It's demeaning.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.927
It's an insult to you, to me..

03:39.010 --> 03:42.221
[chuckles]
Maybe with heels.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.641
Ooh, what about her?
She'd be perfect for Henry.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.310
She's got that delicate,
wispy princess thing going on.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.811
I told you we're not doing that.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.146
Doing what?

03:50.229 --> 03:51.814
Tina thinks I should find
a girlfriend for Henry.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.858
Lauren, will you tell her
that this is a brilliant plan?

03:53.942 --> 03:56.194
You know, once we get Henry
in another relationship

03:56.277 --> 03:58.237
the path to Vince
is free and clear.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.530
Ooh, I love it.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.282
Seriously, can I touch
your belly, please?

04:01.366 --> 04:02.700
- Stop!
- Okay.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.327
I'm not getting Henry
a girlfriend, okay?

04:04.410 --> 04:06.329
I'm going to let everything
take its natural course

04:06.412 --> 04:08.539
and when the time is right,
everyone will be with everyone

04:08.623 --> 04:10.500
they're supposed to be with.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.585
I agree with Holly.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.629
Excuse me. What?

04:14.712 --> 04:16.464
Yeah, I think that
trying to get Henry

04:16.547 --> 04:17.966
a girlfriend is a terrible idea.

04:18.048 --> 04:20.843
Why? Because you don't think
I'm supposed to be with Vince?

04:20.927 --> 04:22.804
No, because of what
you just said.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.722
Well, what did I say?

04:24.806 --> 04:26.933
That in time, everyone would

04:27.016 --> 04:28.226
be with who they're
supposed to be with.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.020
- Huh! And you agree with that?
- Yes?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.855
Because you don't think
I'm supposed to be with Vince.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.691
Why do you hate Vince?
What did he ever do to you?

04:34.774 --> 04:36.651
I-I don't hate Vince.
I was just agreeing with you.

04:36.734 --> 04:39.946
Huh! Well, I agree
with Tina. Ha!

04:40.029 --> 04:41.656
Come on, Tina, let's get
a girlfriend for Henry.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.032
- Okay.
- Oh, you know what?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.326
I saw a cute little
red-haired one over by the..

04:45.410 --> 04:48.162
Sweet mother of God!

04:51.958 --> 04:53.960
Holy crap!

04:54.043 --> 04:55.712
- Damn!
- Damn!

04:57.171 --> 05:00.258
[instrumental music]

05:11.686 --> 05:14.022
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.481
I want to share
something with you.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.399
What?

05:16.482 --> 05:18.067
The very second Gary turns 21

05:18.151 --> 05:20.403
we're gonna get married.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.863
- Aren't you dating the doctor?
- 'Oh!'

05:21.946 --> 05:24.115
We'll be divorced
by then. It's okay.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.537
Val?

05:30.830 --> 05:32.415
Rick? Oh, my God.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.542
- I thought that was you.
- Yeah, it's me.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.878
[chuckles]
I know.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.380
- Look at you.
- Look at you!

05:39.464 --> 05:42.341
I'd rather look at you.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.135
I'm bored.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.220
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. Uh..

05:46.304 --> 05:48.097
This is, um, Rick,
this is Lauren.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.515
We went to high school together.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.977
Oh, really?
My fiance is in high school.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.607
Okay, so let me take a guess,
you were the star quarterback

05:57.690 --> 06:00.443
and you were the beautiful
head cheerleader.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.445
And valedictorian.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.781
Okay, so who dumped who?

06:04.864 --> 06:06.699
- She dumped me.
- He dumped me.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.117
What?
No way. I didn't dump you.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.787
Oh, come on.
You absolutely dumped me.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.288
Why would I dump you?

06:12.371 --> 06:15.166
Yeah, I think I was gross.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.876
I had this weird
hair thing going on

06:16.959 --> 06:20.880
and my car horn played
the theme from "The Godfather."

06:20.963 --> 06:24.008
- Yeah, maybe I did dump you.
- Hmm.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.593
Or maybe we never
actually broke up.

06:25.676 --> 06:29.514
Oh, wow. Then I've
cheated on you a lot.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.140
Oh, then I'm so
breaking up with you.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.391
No, I'm breaking up with you.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.518
[laughing]

06:33.601 --> 06:35.269
Don't break up with him.
He's so cute.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.395
Uh-huh.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.149
So what brings you
to our fair city?

06:40.233 --> 06:43.027
Oh, wow. Fair city.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.987
I don't usually say fair city.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.364
Why do I keep saying fair city?

06:46.447 --> 06:49.033
Ooh, there, I said it again.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.202
Oh, man, you've still
got that cute thing

06:51.285 --> 06:52.829
where you get all embarrassed

06:52.912 --> 06:54.539
you know,
and you kind of babble.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.082
Oh. I don't babble.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.834
I'm not babbling.
Who said I babble?

06:57.917 --> 07:00.336
When did I start babbling?

07:00.419 --> 07:03.339
Maybe since you moved
to this fair city.

07:03.422 --> 07:06.092
- Yeah.
- This is going great.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.344
Isn't it?

07:08.427 --> 07:10.555
Uh, so are you living here now?

07:10.638 --> 07:12.306
Last I heard
you were in Houston.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.433
Yeah, still there,
but I'm moving out here in May.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.019
- So I'm looking for a place.
- Great.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.188
I'm getting married.

07:19.856 --> 07:20.982
[chuckles]

07:23.067 --> 07:25.361
I have a boyfriend in Italy.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.031
- What?
- Yeah, Peter.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.116
Peter, Peter's his name.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.368
He's in Italy.
He's handsome.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.203
Listen, I-I got to go
look at an apartment

07:34.287 --> 07:36.831
but I would love to
catch up, so do you think

07:36.914 --> 07:38.249
your handsome
boyfriend would mind

07:38.332 --> 07:39.709
if you joined me
for drinks tonight?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.377
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.005
Oh, yes, it is.
Hey, what's Peter always saying?

07:44.088 --> 07:47.633
Go out and have fun, that's what
Pete's always saying, huh?

07:48.676 --> 07:50.219
So how's 7 o'clock?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.555
- Uh, great.
- Okay, Union Square Cafe.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.892
- And she can't wait.
- Tell her I'll see her then.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.852
Okay.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.813
Okay, should I see
if Gary's free?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.315
'Cause then maybe we can double.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.692
Ooh, you know, I hope he doesn't
have too much homework.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.867
[instrumental music]

08:15.703 --> 08:18.789
Ooh. Ooh, here comes the body.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.875
You know, I wasn't really
sure about this at first.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.543
But I think
my partial nakedness

08:22.627 --> 08:25.463
just helped me sell
$200 worth of khakis.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.798
The only drawback is
it's chilly in here.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.259
- We know.
- We know.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.928
[giggling]

08:32.010 --> 08:34.263
Excuse me.
Duty calls.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.350
Hey, remember
how I said we should

08:37.433 --> 08:38.851
find a girlfriend for Henry?

08:38.934 --> 08:40.394
Yeah, and remember how I said
we're not doing that?

08:40.477 --> 08:42.563
Apparently, we don't have to.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.525
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.110
She touched his arm.
I bet they're dating.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.154
Tina, if they're dating,
that means he's moved on.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.281
And if he's moved on,
then clearly, so can I.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.407
[gasps]
Go find out!

08:53.491 --> 08:54.951
Okay.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.661
Hey, Henry, what's up, man?

08:56.744 --> 08:59.914
Well, this is...unexpected.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.416
I was just, uh, stopping by
to introduce you to..

09:02.500 --> 09:05.920
Boy, your nipples are just
right there, aren't they?

09:06.003 --> 09:08.256
Yeah.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.465
[coughs]

09:09.548 --> 09:10.633
- Hey.
- Oh, hey!

09:10.716 --> 09:12.593
What, uh,
what are you doing here?

09:12.677 --> 09:14.136
Oh, I just came by to see Gary.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.137
I didn't think I was gonna see

09:15.221 --> 09:16.389
this much of him but, hi!

09:16.472 --> 09:17.932
- Hi!
- Oh, uh, yeah. Kate.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.726
This is, uh, Holly and Gary.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.980
- Um, Holly?
- Uh-huh.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.108
You know, I'm, I'm just gonna

09:27.191 --> 09:28.901
run over there
and look at those cargo pants.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.194
Okay.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.950
Okay, I gotta say,
I'm really uncomfortable.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.911
But yet you can't look away.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.790
Hey, so, uh, Kate, huh?

09:42.873 --> 09:45.418
- You guys dating?
- No, no, we're not dating.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.169
I just, uh, you know
met her at Princeton

09:47.253 --> 09:48.671
and we exchanged some e-mails.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.173
Oh, e-mails, that's good.
Well, she's very pretty.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.717
Don't you think
she's pretty?

09:52.800 --> 09:56.679
She's...yeah..

09:56.762 --> 09:58.514
Well, so you're not
exactly dating

09:58.597 --> 10:00.016
but would you say
that you're pre-dating

10:00.099 --> 10:01.434
on the cusp, more or less?

10:01.517 --> 10:03.686
Well, we're sort of
in this place where..

10:03.769 --> 10:06.689
Wait, what am I doing? I don't
have to explain myself to you.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.357
You're not
my girlfriend anymore.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.776
- Is she?
- That's none of your business.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.529
Okay, we're done.
I've moved on.

10:13.612 --> 10:16.782
So what I'm hearing is,
you've moved on.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.660
Yeah.
I've moved on.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.787
Huh. Well,
I'm very happy for you.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.080
Good.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.091
- He's moved on!
- Oh, my God!

10:40.306 --> 10:42.016
[knocking on door]

10:43.559 --> 10:45.895
You're not going to believe it.
Henry has a girlfriend.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.521
- Wow.
- I know. Can you believe it?

10:47.605 --> 10:50.566
We waited all these weeks, and
now it's here. We're good to go!

10:50.649 --> 10:52.026
- What do you want to do first?
- I, uh..

10:52.109 --> 10:54.403
Movies? No, it's too dark,
nobody will see us there.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.906
Let's just go outside
and hold hands in pure public.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.075
- Holly, wait..
- No! No more waiting.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.826
We're moving on.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.666
She can't come.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.543
Holly.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.671
- Holly, wait.
- I cannot believe you!

11:12.755 --> 11:14.090
A few weeks ago,
you were telling me

11:14.173 --> 11:15.424
that you had feelings for me!

11:15.508 --> 11:16.592
I did, I-I do.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.177
But we agreed to wait
because of Henry.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.345
And you couldn't wait alone?

11:19.428 --> 11:20.930
You had to do it
with a half-naked woman?

11:21.013 --> 11:22.807
Holly, listen to me.
This just happened.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.934
We were watching a movie,
she got up to go to the bathroom

11:25.017 --> 11:28.437
with her clothes on, and when
she came out, she was totally..

11:28.521 --> 11:31.774
They weren't on. I mean,
what was I supposed to do?

11:31.857 --> 11:33.901
So you see a naked girl and you
have to do something about it?

11:33.984 --> 11:35.277
Have you ever heard
of self-control?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.905
I have self-control.
I have lots of self-control.

11:37.988 --> 11:38.989
She, ha ha..

11:39.073 --> 11:40.741
Ha, she doesn't.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.285
I-I mean, sometimes

11:43.369 --> 11:44.870
girls need to learn
no means no.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.123
[scoffs]

11:47.206 --> 11:50.292
Holly, I didn't know we were
supposed to stop our lives.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.586
I mean, this thing with Henry
could've taken six months

11:52.670 --> 11:53.671
a year, two years..

11:53.754 --> 11:55.840
I could've waited two years.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.467
Really?

11:58.551 --> 12:01.637
And you couldn't even
wait three weeks.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.140
You're so not
who I thought you were.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.566
[instrumental music]

12:15.901 --> 12:19.113
Ooh, someone looks
all pretty for her date.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.782
It's not a date.
It's a class reunion.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.325
Just two old friends
getting together

12:23.409 --> 12:24.827
to talk about the old times.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.328
And he's engaged.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.329
Engaged?

12:27.413 --> 12:28.789
Honey, it ain't a done deal

12:28.873 --> 12:30.166
till that wedding ring
is on his finger

12:30.249 --> 12:32.710
and even then,
they come right off.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.046
You know, maybe I should cancel.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.466
I mean, this-this whole
thing feels wrong.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.551
Well, does it feel wrong
because he's engaged

12:40.634 --> 12:43.846
or because he's engaged
and you haven't had any bourbon?

12:45.931 --> 12:47.016
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.434
What's the matter?

12:48.517 --> 12:50.144
I broke up with Vince.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.688
You broke up? I didn't know
you guys were going together.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.398
Oh, yeah, we were
in a really great place

12:54.482 --> 12:57.860
for about 30 seconds.
It was beautiful.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.862
I went over to Vince's,
and there was a girl there.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.947
More naked than Gary.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.782
- He has a girlfriend?
- Oh, no.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.284
It's just some girl he knows.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.203
And he was acting
all like he didn't understand

13:07.286 --> 13:09.413
why I was so mad.
I mean, we had a deal.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.290
We were gonna be together
when Henry was okay

13:11.373 --> 13:12.958
and we didn't say anything
about seeing other people

13:13.042 --> 13:14.793
while we were waiting,
but we didn't have to say it.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.962
It was understood, right?

13:19.089 --> 13:20.341
Right?

13:21.967 --> 13:24.220
Look, I still think that
Vince is the wrong guy for you.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.555
I mean, he's older,
and he has way more experience.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.599
But in this case,
I can kind of see

13:28.682 --> 13:30.851
how he thinks
he didn't do anything wrong.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.772
Oh, my God. 4 o'clock
in the afternoon?

13:39.401 --> 13:41.028
Listen..

13:41.111 --> 13:43.864
...unless you and Vince talked
about not seeing other people..

13:43.948 --> 13:46.075
I mean, maybe he just
assumed that you'd both see

13:46.158 --> 13:47.618
other people
until the time was right.

13:47.701 --> 13:49.036
I cannot believe
you're doing this.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.371
You are actually defending him.

13:50.454 --> 13:51.664
You have been
telling me for weeks that

13:51.747 --> 13:53.040
he's wrong for me,
and now you are actually

13:53.123 --> 13:54.375
standing here defending him.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.835
I'm just looking at it
from his perspective.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.757
Okay, I see what you're doing.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.261
You are defending him because
you know that if you attack him

14:05.344 --> 14:07.596
I will defend him,
and in defending him

14:07.680 --> 14:09.932
I will see that maybe he
really didn't do anything wrong.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.142
But your reverse psychology
isn't going to work

14:12.226 --> 14:13.769
because I just
reversed your reverse

14:13.852 --> 14:15.187
and I see what you
didn't want me to see

14:15.271 --> 14:16.814
which is that Vince
is really an okay guy

14:16.897 --> 14:19.191
and I should give
him another shot! Ha!

14:22.528 --> 14:25.573
[instrumental music]

14:27.241 --> 14:29.827
Okay. I just got yelled
at by my manager.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.788
He said you cannot hang around
here unless you buy something.

14:32.871 --> 14:33.956
Okay?

14:34.039 --> 14:35.708
(all)
Okay.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.795
- Back up.
- Okay.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.926
[instrumental music]

14:46.010 --> 14:47.678
[knocking on door]

14:50.806 --> 14:52.099
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:52.182 --> 14:54.184
- You alone?
- Yeah.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.186
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.986
You still mad?

15:04.069 --> 15:06.363
Well, um, the thought of you
and that girl together

15:06.447 --> 15:07.948
still kind of makes me
want to puke a little

15:08.032 --> 15:12.453
but, um, maybe I
wasn't being completely fair.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.079
I mean, we weren't
officially dating

15:14.163 --> 15:15.831
and we never really said
what we were gonna do

15:15.914 --> 15:17.458
while we were waiting.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.251
I chose to hang out
with my friends

15:19.335 --> 15:21.670
and you chose
to lay on top of yours.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.676
Look, you know I would never
intentionally hurt you.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.094
I know.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.346
[door opens]

15:30.429 --> 15:33.057
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.642
You done with my DVD?

15:34.725 --> 15:36.018
On the TV.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.936
You coming over for
the Knicks?

15:38.020 --> 15:40.189
You're killing me.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.523
See you later.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.363
- That's Thyler.
- She has a key?

15:47.446 --> 15:49.531
I have a key
to her place too.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.619
- Wait a minute.
- No, I have to go.

15:53.702 --> 15:56.872
Wait!
Holly, she's a neighbor.

15:56.955 --> 15:58.540
- Oh, she's a neighbor?
- That's right.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.417
I've known her since
I first moved in here.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.128
We watch basketball
together, share DVDs.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.047
She gets my mail,
I get her mail.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.257
And you never slept
with her?

16:10.177 --> 16:12.179
- Oh, my God.
- Yes! Yes.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.056
I had a brief
relationship with her

16:14.139 --> 16:16.058
two years ago before I met you.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.937
Alright? Okay? I have a past,
and there are girls in it.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.898
Yeah, and they're coming in
through the frickin' windows!

16:22.981 --> 16:24.608
I don't know what to
tell you. I like girls.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.068
I've always liked girls.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.821
But I also want to tell you
I think this can work.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.324
And I hope I can do this.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.119
You hope?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.995
Yeah, I can't
guarantee it'll work.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.248
I mean, no one can guarantee.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.460
What? What did I say?
What do you want?

16:43.544 --> 16:45.713
I want to go back to this
afternoon when I came over here

16:45.796 --> 16:47.172
to tell you that
we could be together.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.924
And I wanted you
to be as excited as I was

16:49.007 --> 16:50.634
and I didn't want to hear,
"I hope I can do this

16:50.718 --> 16:53.637
and I'm gonna try
and there are no guarantees."

16:53.721 --> 16:57.224
And, God, I didn't want
there to be girls.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.685
I'm sorry.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.937
I'm sorry it's not exactly
the way you wanted it

17:02.020 --> 17:04.147
but the best way
to start a relationship

17:04.231 --> 17:05.441
is by being honest.

17:05.523 --> 17:08.777
A bunch of people
told me that.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.573
This is amazing. You're saying
all the wrong things.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.699
Okay. Okay.

17:13.781 --> 17:15.325
This isn't the way
you pictured it

17:15.409 --> 17:18.996
and you're not hearing
the exact words you want to hear

17:19.079 --> 17:21.999
but at least I'm willing
to give it a shot.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.752
I've only got light beer.
You cool with that?

17:25.836 --> 17:27.296
You're killing me.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.512
[instrumental music]

17:41.393 --> 17:43.771
Oh, shoot, I guess
Holly's not here.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.522
I really wanted her to see you.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.149
I know how we can get her here.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.276
Back in the day, every time
we started to fool around..

17:49.359 --> 17:51.862
Bam! There was Holly.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.071
So, you want to make out?

17:53.155 --> 17:55.407
[both laughing]

17:56.533 --> 17:57.993
- But I'm engaged!
- Yeah.

17:58.076 --> 18:00.871
And I got a boyfriend
in Italy.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.998
- So..
- Yeah.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.002
- Red Hots.
- What?

18:07.086 --> 18:10.297
- You used to love Red Hots.
- You remember that?

18:10.380 --> 18:12.007
Oh, are you kidding?
I'll never forget.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.801
Remember that night when we
tried to see how many you could

18:13.884 --> 18:16.011
get in your mouth
before you screamed?

18:16.095 --> 18:19.223
- Six boxes.
- Heh heh. Yeah.

18:19.306 --> 18:22.142
Oh, seeing you standing there

18:22.226 --> 18:24.269
mouth full of Red Hots

18:24.353 --> 18:25.729
tears streaming down your face..

18:25.813 --> 18:29.191
I remember thinking
right then, I am totally in..

18:29.274 --> 18:31.527
Where the hell have you been?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.153
- Totally in-in what?
- Val..

18:33.237 --> 18:34.696
I've been waiting for you
for, like, an hour and a half.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.906
I need to talk to you.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.075
- Wait, that-that's Holly?
- Yeah.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.369
But-but she, she got
so tall and pretty

18:40.452 --> 18:43.747
and that whole snot
thing cleared up.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.667
- You remember Rick, right?
- Oh, yeah. Hey, dude.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.211
- Val, I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.129
Hey, remember that time
I ran over your bike?

18:51.213 --> 18:53.173
Rick, I'd love to
stroll down memory lane

18:53.257 --> 18:54.550
but right now,
I'm totally shattered!

18:54.633 --> 18:58.345
- Need my sis.
- Okay. I'm here.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.930
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, totally cool.

19:00.013 --> 19:04.685
I get it. Um, hey, uh, it's good
to see you, Holly, and, um..

19:04.768 --> 19:07.062
Hope everything works out.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.109
Okay, well, it was really
great seeing you again.

19:12.192 --> 19:17.072
Good luck with everything,
your job, fiance, new life.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.782
And I hope we see
each other again soon.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.993
Yeah, aren't you taking me
to the airport tomorrow?

19:21.076 --> 19:22.744
- Lunch first?
- Definitely.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.037
Okay.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.378
- I'm very angry with you.
- Me?

19:31.461 --> 19:33.130
Yeah, you. You ruined me.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.923
You made me watch
all those romantic movies

19:35.007 --> 19:37.426
"Ghost," "Endless Love,"
"Ice Castles," and you said

19:37.509 --> 19:40.429
that one day,
we would both have that.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.932
- Well, it's crap.
- Hey! Those movies aren't crap.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.184
Okay, well, yeah.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.187
"Ice Castles"
doesn't really hold up.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.564
But we should both have that.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.024
Well, then, why don't I have it?

19:52.107 --> 19:53.817
- What happened?
- He didn't do it.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.444
He didn't say
any of those things.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.571
He was, like, "I'm gonna try,
and there are no guarantees"

19:57.654 --> 19:59.114
and Thyler was there.

19:59.197 --> 20:00.449
Why didn't you just let me watch

20:00.532 --> 20:03.368
prison movies like I wanted?

20:03.452 --> 20:04.494
I'm sorry.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.788
But listen to me, sometimes

20:06.872 --> 20:11.543
movies aren't exactly
like real life.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.838
But no matter what,
never settle for anything

20:14.922 --> 20:17.424
that doesn't feel right.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.092
Okay.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.179
So now how do I stop liking him?

20:22.262 --> 20:24.348
That I can't help you with.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.808
But you were right
before when you said that

20:26.892 --> 20:29.269
everyone will
end up with exactly

20:29.353 --> 20:31.438
who they're supposed to be with.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.816
I just got your message.
He's such a jackass.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.985
But I brought you
something to cheer you up.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.655
- Cake?
- Better.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.823
Bring it in here!

20:46.620 --> 20:48.664
Alright, I'm only doing
this because I love you

20:48.747 --> 20:50.332
and you're my friend,
and they said that

20:50.415 --> 20:53.168
this will make you feel
better, so go ahead.

20:53.251 --> 20:55.629
- You can touch my abs.
- Aw.

20:55.712 --> 21:00.175
Gary, I love you too,
but that's weird.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.511
- Okay.
- Wait! Wait, I have pain.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.680
I have no one in my life!

21:06.264 --> 21:08.517
I confuse sex with love.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.229
You want in?

21:14.022 --> 21:17.025
Well, I do feel
kind of bad for my sister.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.195
Ooh.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.705
