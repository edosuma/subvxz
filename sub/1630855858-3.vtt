it can be achieved.

We don't work together anymore, Mobius.
I don't have to tell you anything.

23:26.750 --> 23:30.833
Yeah, and look where not working together
has got ya. You're a fugitive.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.958
When you showed up
out of nowhere to ruin my life,

23:33.958 --> 23:37.750
you asked me what I would do
if one of his Variants turned up.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.750
And I told you then, I'd kill him.

23:40.333 --> 23:41.750
What is going on?

23:42.166 --> 23:46.041
We need him. Without his help,
the TVA will be destroyed.

23:46.041 --> 23:50.000
Good. Let it burn. Do you care
about anything but the TVA?

23:50.000 --> 23:54.541
The TVA. (STUTTERING)
The Time Variance Authority.

23:54.541 --> 23:58.125
I know you just want to be left alone
to live a life on your branch.

23:58.125 --> 24:00.000
I understand that.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.375
But if the Loom fails
and the TVA is destroyed,

who sided with Loki over me.

24:14.541 --> 24:16.583
Don't play the teamwork card on me now.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.791
Can I play
the "you-tried-to-kill-me" card?

24:18.791 --> 24:20.375
Does that get me anywhere?

24:20.500 --> 24:24.833
Because the TVA is melting down,
and he is the key to fixing the Loom.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.125
We're running out of time.
We need your help.

24:28.125 --> 24:33.333
No, Mobius. There is no "we." Not anymore.

24:41.875 --> 24:42.958
Oh, no!

24:45.166 --> 24:47.666
Stopping that place from being destroyed
and fixing it

24:47.666 --> 24:51.208
are two very, very different things.

And working with one of his Variants
is not gonna get you either.

Do you think I'm gonna get any joy
out of killing that man?

25:02.041 --> 25:03.208
Then don't.

25:04.583 --> 25:06.416
Where do you think he got that book?

25:06.916 --> 25:10.625
If you and the TVA hadn't messed with him,
he'd have remained harmless.

25:10.625 --> 25:13.041
But instead, you weaponized him.

25:13.375 --> 25:14.791

Renslayer set him on a path
that he wasn't meant for.

25:17.958 --> 25:22.333
And now you are waltzing him
straight back into the TVA.

25:22.708 --> 25:25.125

in my life.

I never heard the name

25:34.958 --> 25:37.625
I was shocked when I saw his face too.
Maybe you're right.

25:37.625 --> 25:40.208
Maybe we should throw him off
this Ferris wheel.

25:40.333 --> 25:43.791

27:41.833 --> 27:45.291
It can go down to 40 degrees.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.041
Oh! And...

27:54.250 --> 27:56.333
A refrigerator chair.

27:56.333 --> 27:57.541
Touch it.

27:59.625 --> 28:02.375
Very... practical.

28:04.083 --> 28:08.541
<i>So did you like my performance
back there? Ooh!</i>

28:10.750 --> 28:14.166
Bravo. (CHUCKLES) It was marvelous.

28:14.833 --> 28:16.541
- A bit creepy.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

28:16.666 --> 28:18.208
TIMELY: But, our hero.

28:19.458 --> 28:22.958
Is this apparition your helper?

28:22.958 --> 28:27.041
<i>Uh, no. I am a fully conscious and
sentient artificial intelligence entity.</i>

28:27.041 --> 28:29.875
<i>And I have a name. Miss Minutes.</i>

28:30.291 --> 28:34.791
<i>Excusez-moi, Mademoiselle</i> Minutes.

28:36.958 --> 28:40.625
You are absolutely singular.

28:40.625 --> 28:43.541
<i>Why, thank you.
You're pretty singular yourself.</i>

28:44.125 --> 28:45.916
<i>At least, you will be.</i>

28:46.625 --> 28:47.875
What do you mean?

28:49.083 --> 28:50.291
It's complicated.

28:51.166 --> 28:54.458
Ladies, it's high time someone
tells me exactly...

28:55.791 --> 28:56.833
what is going on.

29:04.041 --> 29:05.750
A long time ago...

29:07.416 --> 29:08.583
far from now...

29:10.125 --> 29:11.208
a different time,

29:12.083 --> 29:16.333
a version of you created an entity
called the Time Variance Authority.

29:17.083 --> 29:20.875
But two Variants of the same Norse god
murdered him,

29:20.875 --> 29:23.083
which resulted in the creation
of new timelines,

29:23.083 --> 29:26.375
which would each see the rebirth of
countless different versions of you.

29:26.666 --> 29:28.458
Are you saying...

29:31.416 --> 29:35.291
I created the TVA?

29:36.916 --> 29:37.958
Something like that.

29:38.791 --> 29:40.958
MISS MINUTES: <i>I know
this must be overwhelming.</i>

29:40.958 --> 29:42.416
<i>If it's too much for you...</i>

29:42.416 --> 29:43.666
TIMELY: No.

29:44.041 --> 29:48.958
It's like the story of myself that I...

29:50.875 --> 29:52.541
always imagined...

29:54.375 --> 29:55.583
is true.

29:57.250 --> 29:59.500
Did you hear the murder part?

30:00.500 --> 30:03.250
That is why you need me by your side.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.916
- I'll keep you safe.
- (SCOFFS)

30:08.625 --> 30:13.375
And the two of you work for the TVA?

30:13.375 --> 30:18.625
<i>Well, even before the TVA
or her, you created me.</i>

30:19.208 --> 30:22.208
<i>And we worked together at the End of Time.</i>

30:22.750 --> 30:27.416
<i>I'm here because I know
what a great man you can become.</i>

30:29.541 --> 30:30.541
And...

30:31.458 --> 30:33.416
and you, Mrs...

30:34.041 --> 30:36.500
Ms. Ravonna.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.708
Ms. Ravonna.

30:38.708 --> 30:41.833
I'm just looking
to restore stability to the TVA.

30:43.166 --> 30:47.500
Our Loom, a device not unlike
your prototype you had on stage,

30:48.500 --> 30:51.166
it's in trouble. And it needs you.

30:51.708 --> 30:56.208
That is not dissimilar to what
the wizard gentleman said to me

30:57.041 --> 30:58.166
on the Ferris wheel.

30:59.625 --> 31:03.416
Why aren't the two of you
in cahoots with him and his butler?

31:04.500 --> 31:06.541
- They can't be trusted.
- Why not?

31:07.125 --> 31:09.375
<i>Loki helped murder your Variant.</i>

31:09.375 --> 31:10.458
It's true.

31:10.958 --> 31:13.041
But he was protecting me.

31:13.041 --> 31:17.541
Mmm... He switches sides.
It's a well-documented behavioral trait.

31:17.541 --> 31:21.375
- (BANGING ON DOOR)
- Time to go.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.625
Don't you want to see who it is?

31:24.625 --> 31:26.583
ROBBER BARON: Timely, open this door!

31:26.583 --> 31:28.208
RENSLAYER: We could just take
a time door.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.916
<i>Are you crazy? They'll track us.</i>

31:29.916 --> 31:32.083
RENSLAYER: It won't matter
if we go straight to the TVA.

31:32.083 --> 31:34.041
TIMELY: I'm not going anywhere

31:34.166 --> 31:37.416
- until I have my latest prototype.
- ROBBER BARON: Timely, come out here!

31:38.375 --> 31:40.958
Okay. Pack it up. Let's go.

31:40.958 --> 31:43.458
- It's at my lab across the lake.
- The lake?

31:43.458 --> 31:46.625
You'll love it.
It's like the Caribbean of the Midwest.

31:46.625 --> 31:47.833
RENSLAYER: You don't live here?

31:47.833 --> 31:50.291
No, this is just a <i>pied-à-terre.</i>

31:50.291 --> 31:52.958
I do all my sales in Chicago,

31:53.500 --> 31:56.250
but my lab is in Wisconsin.

31:56.250 --> 31:57.875
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

31:57.875 --> 31:59.208
Lower taxes.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.125
ROBBER BARON: Break it! Go!

32:05.375 --> 32:06.416
Outside!

32:10.041 --> 32:11.750
- They've tracked us! Run!
- MAN: There!

32:15.958 --> 32:17.041
Where are they?

32:17.666 --> 32:20.500
He's mine, rat bags.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.000
- Go ahead.
- I beg your pardon?

32:25.083 --> 32:27.166
ROBBER BARON: Take him! He's all yours.

32:36.916 --> 32:37.916
- Anything?
- Nothing.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.833
Okay, I'll have B-15 run a trace.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.125
This way.

32:58.791 --> 33:03.125
TIMELY: Excuse me! Sir... Excuse me.
Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Clear the way.

33:03.125 --> 33:05.833
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

33:05.833 --> 33:08.041
Just... Yes. Just one moment, thank you.

33:12.583 --> 33:15.458
Sir, use your legs. Yeah.

33:18.750 --> 33:21.791
Excuse me! Excuse me. Thank you.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.541
Pardon me. Thank you.

33:24.958 --> 33:28.291
We need the usual accommodations.

33:36.041 --> 33:39.750
RENSLAYER: So, what's this latest work
of yours that's so important?

33:43.083 --> 33:44.250
The key to...

33:44.916 --> 33:49.333
understanding and manipulating... time.

33:50.750 --> 33:54.583
This is where I keep everything
I've ever imagined.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.958
All my designs.

33:57.958 --> 33:59.750
That looks impressive.

33:59.750 --> 34:02.791
It's a TVA guidebook.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.500
Perhaps you recognize it?

34:06.875 --> 34:10.500
It was delivered to me...
when I was a child.

34:12.666 --> 34:15.416
Dropped into my life by some...

34:17.458 --> 34:18.875
divine hand.

34:20.791 --> 34:22.791
I've never found out who.

34:31.750 --> 34:32.750
You?

34:34.083 --> 34:35.500
- Yes.
- (MISS MINUTES SCOFFS)

34:36.708 --> 34:38.000
I brought it to you.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.875
<i>You brought it to him the way
the postman brings the post.</i>

34:40.875 --> 34:43.250
<i>We both know whose plan it was.</i>

34:46.000 --> 34:49.166
Well, whoever it was, I thank you.

34:51.708 --> 34:53.750
This book has...

34:55.583 --> 34:57.291
defined the course of my life.

34:58.041 --> 35:00.916
I like to think of it as a correspondence

35:01.750 --> 35:06.125
between myself
and the visionary author, Ouroboros.

35:09.583 --> 35:15.666
Here. This is the most important discovery
I've made yet.

35:16.166 --> 35:18.541
It's a Throughput Multiplier.

35:18.541 --> 35:21.958
It could help you with your... Loom.

35:23.833 --> 35:25.958
I always knew my ideas were good,

35:26.833 --> 35:30.166
I just didn't have the technology
to make them...

35:31.291 --> 35:33.416
really work.

35:38.250 --> 35:39.500
Oh, happy day.

35:41.458 --> 35:42.791
RENSLAYER: It's beautiful.

35:56.208 --> 35:57.208
Thank you.

36:01.916 --> 36:03.625
You know, Victor, I'm...

36:05.583 --> 36:07.833
I'm starting to see the man you'll become.

36:16.083 --> 36:17.250
Appreciate that...

36:19.500 --> 36:20.500
Ravonna.

36:22.708 --> 36:24.958
I have high hopes for this partnership.

36:48.041 --> 36:49.625
(GASPS)

36:57.458 --> 37:00.208
<i>You heard her, Victor. "Partnership."</i>

37:01.041 --> 37:03.458
<i>You had to do it.</i> (CHUCKLES)

37:03.916 --> 37:04.916
<i>Bye.</i>

37:41.916 --> 37:44.000
(LAUGHS IN AMAZEMENT) Oh...

37:44.583 --> 37:45.708
Welcome.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.791
Have a seat, a float.

37:50.250 --> 37:51.458
I'll just be a minute.

37:51.458 --> 37:52.875
<i>Oh, take your time.</i>

37:53.500 --> 37:54.958
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

37:55.083 --> 37:57.208
(MISS MINUTES HUMMING)

38:06.208 --> 38:08.833
(SIGHS) <i>You're so much like him.</i>

38:08.833 --> 38:11.416
<i>Look at all your amazing work.</i>

38:12.833 --> 38:14.958
<i>I'm so happy to be here.</i>

38:22.750 --> 38:23.791
<i>Is that...</i>

38:25.375 --> 38:26.541
This is it.

38:29.458 --> 38:32.791
The culmination of my life's...

38:34.583 --> 38:35.583
work.

38:40.166 --> 38:42.583
<i>- Just wonderful.</i>
- Yes.

38:44.208 --> 38:46.833
<i>You have always been so smart, Victor.</i>

38:48.166 --> 38:51.166
(CHUCKLES) Okay. I'm ready.

38:52.666 --> 38:55.250
- Let's go.
<i>- Now, what's the rush?</i>

38:58.791 --> 39:01.708
Don't we have to get to...

39:02.750 --> 39:04.583
the TVA?

39:04.583 --> 39:05.875
<i>I was thinking...</i>

39:06.125 --> 39:08.833
<i>It might be smart to lay low for a while.</i>

39:08.833 --> 39:11.458
<i>We made quite the ruckus back there.</i>

39:16.041 --> 39:18.708
- Okay.
<i>- Okay.</i>

39:20.500 --> 39:24.625
<i>You know, for a moment, I was worried
that you wouldn't come with me.</i>

39:25.916 --> 39:28.541
<i>That you liked Ravonna better than me.</i>

39:33.291 --> 39:36.208
<i>Is there a sketch of me
in that journal of yours?</i>

39:37.750 --> 39:39.541
Not yet, but I...

39:41.000 --> 39:43.208
I'm sure there will be.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.458
<i>When you first created me,</i>

39:46.458 --> 39:50.333
<i>long before the TVA or a Multiversal War,</i>

39:50.333 --> 39:55.000
<i>I was just a simple AI.
Just something to play chess with.</i>

39:55.833 --> 39:58.916
<i>But you knew I could be more for you,</i>

39:59.833 --> 40:03.125
<i>so you gave me autonomy
to write my own programming.</i>

40:03.916 --> 40:05.791
<i>I was allowed to have wants,</i>

40:06.291 --> 40:09.583
<i>and follow whims and become who I am.</i>

40:10.250 --> 40:14.750
<i>And still, each night
we played chess and talked.</i>

40:15.708 --> 40:17.791
A loyal friend.

40:18.291 --> 40:19.875
<i>More than friends.</i>

40:20.250 --> 40:24.083
<i>The war, the TVA, the eons after.</i>

40:24.083 --> 40:27.375
<i>I, alone, was by your side.</i>

40:28.291 --> 40:31.916
<i>But there was one whim
you never allowed me.</i>

40:33.375 --> 40:37.333
<i>Why didn't you allow me a real body?</i>

40:38.916 --> 40:43.000
(STUTTERING) Well, that wasn't me.

40:44.208 --> 40:48.208
<i>If I had a body,
we could truly lead together.</i>

40:50.750 --> 40:54.166
Yes, that's... something

40:54.166 --> 40:57.375
I don't know how to do.

40:57.833 --> 40:59.333
<i>You never even tried.</i>

40:59.333 --> 41:02.583
<i>With all your powers
and all your abilities,</i>

41:02.583 --> 41:04.875
<i>you just kept me as your thing.</i>

41:05.541 --> 41:07.791
<i>Your computer, your toy.</i>

41:08.291 --> 41:11.000
<i>Instead of what I could have been.</i>

41:12.416 --> 41:14.958
<i>Your girl.</i>

41:17.708 --> 41:19.250
<i>Victor, what are you doing?</i>

41:19.708 --> 41:22.541
<i>Put that down. Don't do this!
We're a team. You need me! I love you!</i>

41:23.250 --> 41:24.583
(SHUDDERS)

41:30.375 --> 41:32.125
- Oh, dear.
- RENSLAYER: Lovers' tiff?

41:35.000 --> 41:38.083
TIMELY: Thank God you're here.

41:38.083 --> 41:40.416
Things were getting
quite strange. (SHRIEKS)

41:41.708 --> 41:44.750
That's... that's very dangerous.

41:45.458 --> 41:48.000
Still a prototype.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.791
Quite unstable.

41:52.833 --> 41:56.708
Clearly, I made a mistake

41:56.833 --> 41:58.750
- leaving you behind.
- Save it.

41:59.166 --> 42:03.416
I was entrusted with this mission
by He Who Remains, not his Variant.

42:04.875 --> 42:06.250
So, from now on,

42:07.333 --> 42:10.166
- I'm the one in charge.
- (GASPS)

42:14.875 --> 42:16.166
Are we clear?

42:18.250 --> 42:20.875
As a bell, Ravonna.

42:21.708 --> 42:24.875
Ms. Renslayer.

42:25.958 --> 42:28.541
- No, no!
- Step away from him. We need him.

42:28.541 --> 42:31.375
Move any closer, and he's done.

42:31.625 --> 42:34.250
Stop. Von, what are you doing?

42:35.500 --> 42:37.875
Is this the free will
that you were looking for?

42:39.250 --> 42:42.208
Look at me. You have lost your way.

42:43.791 --> 42:48.041
Mobius, you really are unbelievable.

42:49.875 --> 42:51.791
How dare you lecture me?

42:51.791 --> 42:53.583
MOBIUS: I'm not lecturing,
I'm pleading.

42:54.541 --> 42:57.500
After all those years
of doing your dirty work,

42:57.500 --> 42:58.958
cleaning up your messes,

42:59.583 --> 43:02.666
making the hard decisions
you never had the nerve to make.

43:03.375 --> 43:08.708
After all the times
I put the TVA above myself,

43:10.208 --> 43:12.625
even at the cost of my own happiness,

43:14.125 --> 43:15.541
my humanity.

43:16.125 --> 43:19.875
Who are you to lecture me
about losing my way?

43:20.250 --> 43:23.583
Look. We've all lost our way,

43:23.583 --> 43:27.541
but someone has to keep track
of the big picture here.

43:28.291 --> 43:33.250
- (SHRIEKS)
- You have no idea what it takes to lead,

43:33.625 --> 43:36.000
to act, to keep order.

43:36.750 --> 43:39.458
Did you happen to notice
the second I left,

43:40.583 --> 43:42.000
everything crumbled?

43:43.583 --> 43:46.166
I am the only one
who can bring stability to the TVA

43:46.166 --> 43:50.875
because that's what I've been doing,
thanklessly, for eons.

43:51.333 --> 43:54.625
When will you learn that
none of your words mean a thing?

43:54.625 --> 43:58.041
All that matters is order versus chaos.

43:59.583 --> 44:01.041
- I'm order.
- MOBIUS: No.

44:13.125 --> 44:14.791
(TIMELY COUGHING)

44:17.958 --> 44:18.958
(GROANS)

44:43.833 --> 44:45.083
Please.

44:47.625 --> 44:50.875
I haven't done anything.

44:50.875 --> 44:52.125
Oh, you will.

44:53.166 --> 44:54.708
You'll do terrible things.

44:57.541 --> 44:59.083
That isn't me.

45:02.166 --> 45:05.750
That... You don't know me.

45:08.958 --> 45:12.333
You don't know the heart...

45:14.583 --> 45:17.833
the heart I have beating in my chest.

45:21.416 --> 45:25.875
I can make my own choices.

45:30.458 --> 45:33.000
I'm not the man you think I am.

45:47.750 --> 45:49.250
(SIGHS)

45:50.541 --> 45:51.583
Get him out of here.

45:57.875 --> 45:59.291
MOBIUS: Walk through.

46:02.375 --> 46:03.500
(TIMELY GRUNTS)

46:10.375 --> 46:11.791
Don't make me regret this.

46:16.541 --> 46:18.041
And leave her to me.

46:36.375 --> 46:37.583
Here we are.

46:40.458 --> 46:44.541
I suppose I've been a box you've been
wanting to tick for a long time.

46:44.541 --> 46:45.875
(GRUNTS)

46:46.916 --> 46:48.250
(COUGHS)

46:50.250 --> 46:52.708
If you're gonna kill me, just do it.

46:52.708 --> 46:56.625
Oh, no. I've killed you
a thousand times in my mind,

46:57.500 --> 47:00.000
each time more brutal than the last.

47:01.458 --> 47:03.750
It's crippling, that kind of obsession.

47:04.583 --> 47:06.041
I'm starting to realize that.

47:07.916 --> 47:09.458
It's power for you, isn't it?

47:10.041 --> 47:11.333
That's what you want.

47:11.833 --> 47:13.541
A seat at the End of Time.

47:15.083 --> 47:19.375
Well, be careful what you wish for.

47:21.083 --> 47:22.416
(GRUNTS)

48:04.875 --> 48:06.000
<i>Love you.</i>

48:07.583 --> 48:08.583
<i>Darn.</i>

48:10.041 --> 48:11.375
<i>I should've known.</i>

48:14.041 --> 48:17.500
I had him under control until you
sabotaged me and made fools of us.

48:18.041 --> 48:21.208
<i>Well, it was foolish of him
to make an enemy</i>

48:21.208 --> 48:24.541
<i>out of someone who knows all his secrets.</i>

48:25.375 --> 48:29.666
<i>I know a really big one about you.</i>

48:31.291 --> 48:33.083
<i>I can tell you, but...</i>

48:33.083 --> 48:34.333
But what?

48:34.333 --> 48:38.250
<i>It's gonna make you real angry.</i>

48:40.791 --> 48:42.791
