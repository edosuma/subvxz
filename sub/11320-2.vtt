WEBVTT

00:20.895 --> 00:21.980
What are you doing here?

00:22.897 --> 00:24.315
Marry me.

00:26.609 --> 00:27.902
I'll marry you.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.204
Ms. Kang?

00:40.623 --> 00:41.624
Do you know her?

00:41.958 --> 00:42.959
What?

00:43.084 --> 00:44.210
Yes.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.005
She works in the kitchen
at our restaurant.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.923
Why are you here at this hour?

00:49.507 --> 00:50.592
She works here?

00:51.301 --> 00:52.302
Yes.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.221
Introduce yourself.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.975
He is the director of Restaurant Services
from the head office.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.351
Pardon?

01:01.227 --> 01:02.312
What did you just say?

01:03.521 --> 01:05.273
-What did you hear--
-Never mind.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.027
I don't know what I said.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.279
I didn't say anything.

01:11.362 --> 01:12.447
I didn't hear anything.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.240
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:16.951 --> 01:17.952
What...

01:23.416 --> 01:24.417
Let's go home.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.255
No way.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.217
The car accident con artist was her?

01:32.425 --> 01:35.136
The one who fainted
without even getting hit?

01:35.512 --> 01:37.388
-No way.
-Who hired her?

01:37.847 --> 01:39.224
Did you run a proper background check?

01:40.266 --> 01:42.018
Of course, I did.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.688
We got referrals and she has
a lot of experience as a cook.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.357
My goodness.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.943
She looks naive and innocent too.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.820
Who doesn't look that way to you?

01:51.986 --> 01:53.238
Run a thorough background check.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.906
Check if she has a criminal record too.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.991
I doubt that.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.285
First, make sure she keeps her mouth shut

01:59.786 --> 02:01.162
and doesn't tell anyone what she heard.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.375
Well then,
why did you say something like that?

02:05.875 --> 02:09.045
I know you're desperate,
but it's unreasonable to fabricate

02:09.170 --> 02:11.464
a daughter-in-law
in order to give your mother a transplant.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.052
Nothing is unreasonable
when it comes to saving a life.

02:16.719 --> 02:17.846
We don't have time.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.181
Contact the local brokers first.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.724
There must be some experts.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.581
Goodness, Ms. Kang.
Why are you home so late?

02:45.331 --> 02:47.876
Two really big men were waiting
all day long

02:48.001 --> 02:49.752
and they just left.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.046
-They left?
-Who are they?

02:53.047 --> 02:54.674
Are they loan sharks?

02:56.467 --> 02:58.720
-Good night.
-Okay.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.891
My goodness.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.327
So what are you saying?

03:23.244 --> 03:24.245
So...

03:24.621 --> 03:26.331
You'll get a fake wife

03:26.748 --> 03:28.708
to give your mom a liver transplant?

03:30.793 --> 03:31.794
How much will it take?

03:32.962 --> 03:33.963
One hundred million won?

03:34.088 --> 03:35.089
Two hundred million won?

03:37.508 --> 03:38.635
One hundred million won.

03:41.721 --> 03:42.722
One hundred million won...

03:46.976 --> 03:48.269
I must have lost my mind.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.772
Even if I am in desperate need
for money...

03:51.773 --> 03:52.857
I shouldn't. Right, Eun-seong?

04:01.741 --> 04:03.409
My goodness.

04:17.840 --> 04:18.841
What happened?

04:18.925 --> 04:21.469
I don't know what happened either.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.597
I stepped out for a minute
and she was gone.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.483
-Is the chairman in?
-You can't--

04:35.566 --> 04:37.735
I'll be quick.
I have something to tell him.

04:37.819 --> 04:38.820
Ma'am!

04:43.116 --> 04:44.117
He's in the study.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.711
It's been a while.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.629
How did you get in?

04:58.631 --> 05:00.383
I wanted to see you just once,

05:00.591 --> 05:02.802
but I had no way of reaching you.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.680
You ignore all my calls

05:05.805 --> 05:07.390
and you can't leave home,

05:07.807 --> 05:09.392
so I had to come here myself.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.144
What's wrong?

05:11.853 --> 05:13.104
Aren't you happy to see me?

05:15.690 --> 05:16.983
Get out of my house.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.488
This outfit...

05:23.197 --> 05:25.325
You bought me this outfit 30 years ago.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.076
Don't you remember?

05:27.493 --> 05:29.871
You sent me the hat with the outfit.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.499
I lost some weight recently,

05:33.624 --> 05:36.335
so it fits perfectly now.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.588
I know my face is all wrinkly,

05:39.130 --> 05:40.131
but what do you think?

05:40.506 --> 05:41.924
Not bad, right?

05:42.258 --> 05:43.551
Are you out of your mind?

05:43.926 --> 05:45.011
How dare you come here?

05:49.724 --> 05:51.267
It was your birthday.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.021
I came to drop off your gift.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.233
Why are you suddenly doing this?

06:40.608 --> 06:41.776
What more do you want?

06:42.401 --> 06:44.153
I don't want anything.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.824
I came to say

06:48.825 --> 06:50.201
my final goodbye.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.331
Another final goodbye?

06:56.165 --> 06:57.458
Aren't you sick of that already?

06:58.459 --> 06:59.460
You're right.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.631
I've done that so many times already,

07:04.841 --> 07:06.968
you must be sick and tired of it.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.929
However,

07:10.304 --> 07:11.305
this time,

07:11.764 --> 07:13.433
it really will be the last time.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.395
I wonder...

07:20.022 --> 07:22.608
what I meant to you.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.529
How much did you care about me?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.657
I came to ask that.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.911
I really want to hear the answer.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.747
Please tell me.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.712
Seong-guk.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.047
I want to know.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.301
How important...

07:50.261 --> 07:52.722
was I to you?

08:02.190 --> 08:03.774
When you come to someone's home,

08:04.734 --> 08:07.195
you should ask for permission first.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.366
Get out.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.244
The chairman needs to receive

08:15.786 --> 08:17.330
his physical therapy.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.957
I'll leave even if you tell me not to.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.834
You dropped my hat.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.340
This is his birthday present.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.675
I made some pickled abalone.

08:31.093 --> 08:34.263
He used to ask for it
whenever he didn't have an appetite.

08:36.849 --> 08:37.808
You see,

08:38.267 --> 08:41.062
I'm actually quite a good cook.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.605
I said to get out!

08:43.105 --> 08:44.106
Get out!

08:44.690 --> 08:45.691
Get out!

08:46.692 --> 08:47.985
Get out.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.446
Do you still hate me that much?

08:50.696 --> 08:53.407
Do you still like that old man that much?

08:53.866 --> 08:56.994
He never cared for you
and cheated all the time.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.121
Don't you hate him?

08:59.914 --> 09:00.915
I guess

09:01.541 --> 09:03.334
you really have a big heart.

09:03.501 --> 09:04.502
Get out.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.004
Get out of my house now!

09:11.759 --> 09:13.886
I'm glad you're here.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.722
Take her out of here.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.103
Let's go, Mom.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.731
Forget it. Don't treat me like a criminal.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.651
I'll walk out on my own.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.448
Take this too.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.618
As if we don't already know
you're from a hick town.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.954
We don't eat things like this.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.754
Let's go.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.506
Let's go!

10:00.266 --> 10:02.727
What did I do wrong?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.521
Tell me.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.107
What did I do?

10:10.401 --> 10:12.903
Your husband is the one who did wrong.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.948
What did I do wrong?

10:18.326 --> 10:20.536
Tell him to give me my life back.

10:22.496 --> 10:26.042
Give me my life back!

10:28.044 --> 10:29.045
My life...

10:31.589 --> 10:35.635
Give me my life back!

10:39.889 --> 10:41.015
My life...

10:42.141 --> 10:43.893
What did I do wrong?

10:45.936 --> 10:47.396
Give it back!

10:53.778 --> 10:55.696
Let me sit for a minute.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.451
It's chilly out.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.703
Don't sit there. Go in.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.082
I'm sick of hospitals.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.089
Who said you could leave the hospital?

11:13.589 --> 11:14.924
Do you want to die on the streets?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.134
I'm going to die anyway.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.845
What does it matter where I die?

11:21.472 --> 11:22.723
Let's go in.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.642
Don't do this again.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.229
Yesterday,

11:30.189 --> 11:32.233
the cirrhosis patient next door...

11:33.442 --> 11:34.902
died and was taken out.

11:37.571 --> 11:40.574
I should settle my affairs too.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.077
I went to see

11:44.620 --> 11:47.415
your father one last time.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.218
Ji-hun.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.932
A long time ago,

12:05.808 --> 12:07.518
when I sent you to that house...

12:09.270 --> 12:10.771
Why are you bringing that up?

12:11.480 --> 12:12.481
I...

12:15.276 --> 12:17.319
To be honest, it was too hard for me.

12:18.988 --> 12:19.989
I sent you there

12:21.031 --> 12:22.992
because I thought I couldn't raise you.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.078
When your dad said

12:26.579 --> 12:28.289
he'd take you with him,

12:30.624 --> 12:32.251
I agreed willingly

12:32.793 --> 12:34.503
and was grateful.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.924
I could barely take care of myself

12:39.425 --> 12:40.801
and was going crazy as it was.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.350
I'm sorry.

12:50.644 --> 12:51.770
You were

12:53.272 --> 12:55.274
such a good son.

12:58.736 --> 12:59.737
You were kind

13:00.488 --> 13:02.531
and such a good son.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.120
Even that

13:09.038 --> 13:10.247
kindness and...

13:12.124 --> 13:13.626
goodness was

13:15.252 --> 13:16.754
too much for me.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.465
Your mom...

13:20.549 --> 13:23.302
is that big of a loser.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.598
To think I was begging you to save me...

13:30.226 --> 13:31.769
I have no shame.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.565
I know that too.

13:37.691 --> 13:38.692
But...

13:42.988 --> 13:43.989
Please...

13:45.157 --> 13:47.284
Please don't hate me too much.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.372
I'm still your mom.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.250
So please...

13:55.834 --> 13:57.127
remember me once in a while.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.715
You're making me cringe.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.552
Are you writing your will already?

14:06.637 --> 14:07.638
Yes.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.431
It's my will.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.725
My pathetic will.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.603
You can get surgery.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.106
It will be your turn to get a donor soon.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.024
I know it takes

14:19.692 --> 14:21.777
over a 100 years to get a transplant.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.282
Don't try so hard to console me.

14:42.089 --> 14:45.634
We are expecting
many foreign customers today,

14:45.718 --> 14:47.303
so please take extra care of
the wine setting.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.304
Chef!

14:48.470 --> 14:49.680
Are you ready?

14:59.440 --> 15:02.067
Let's have a good day's work.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.278
Let's do this!

15:04.403 --> 15:05.404
Let's do this!

15:05.487 --> 15:07.364
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

15:07.448 --> 15:08.449
Kang Hye-su?

15:09.199 --> 15:10.743
-Let's cheer...
-Okay.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.707
Let's get to work.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.208
Kitchen crew. Come in.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.460
Step it up!

15:23.797 --> 15:25.049
About that woman from last night...

15:25.591 --> 15:26.759
The new assistant chef.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.677
Who?

15:31.805 --> 15:32.932
Kang Hye-su?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.060
Do a background check on her.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.811
Something is off about her.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.939
What do you mean?

15:40.272 --> 15:42.149
I'm telling you, she's not like that.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.276
Just do it! I just don't like her!

15:44.902 --> 15:46.278
Fine.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.032
It's not even a big deal...

15:50.115 --> 15:51.116
Hey.

15:55.996 --> 15:56.997
What about the broker?

15:57.414 --> 15:58.415
Did you meet him?

16:03.712 --> 16:05.255
Here's a list of candidates.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.258
You're getting me nervous.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.427
Must we go this far?

16:21.480 --> 16:22.940
Start cooking the Gorgonzola pizza.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.400
-Yes, Chef!
-Hye-su, where's the salad?

16:24.483 --> 16:25.484
It's all done.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.204
Did you make the citron sauce?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.081
Yes.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.501
It's perfect.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.338
Thank you.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.841
We finally have someone talented.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.343
The manager is a horrible judge of people.

16:51.468 --> 16:52.886
He just acts busy.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.766
Were you just badmouthing me?

16:57.891 --> 16:59.309
Yes, I was.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.521
That guy...

17:02.604 --> 17:04.148
You may not know just by looking at him,

17:04.565 --> 17:05.816
but he's a friend of the director.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.027
That's how he got the job.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.612
His face has "incompetent"
written all over it. Look.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.158
Hye-su.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.077
-Yes?
-May I have a word with you?

17:17.786 --> 17:18.787
Pardon?

17:24.835 --> 17:26.086
Well...

17:27.129 --> 17:28.130
The thing is...

17:28.589 --> 17:30.049
About last night...

17:30.507 --> 17:31.508
Sorry?

17:31.633 --> 17:34.261
About what Mr. Han
and I were talking about.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.013
How much did you hear?

17:36.764 --> 17:37.765
No, actually.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.391
I didn't hear anything.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.936
Right? You didn't hear anything, right?

17:43.520 --> 17:44.521
Right.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.939
Don't worry. I didn't.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.902
But...

17:50.444 --> 17:53.072
you've met Mr. Han before, right?

17:54.490 --> 17:56.408
I was in a car accident nearby.

17:58.994 --> 17:59.995
Hey.

18:00.996 --> 18:01.997
What?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.291
-What's your name?
-I want your manager.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.085
Her name is Kang Hye-su.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.669
-She's a new hire.
-Wait.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.838
Wait. How may I help you?

18:11.965 --> 18:13.300
Who's the boss here?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.302
That would be me.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.262
-What brings you here?
-Kang Hye-su...

18:17.846 --> 18:19.098
Here she comes.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.599
Hey, lady.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.559
You should've told us that you got a job.

18:22.684 --> 18:23.852
Let's talk outside.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.270
Why are you acting friendly?

18:26.271 --> 18:27.815
-Oh my gosh.
-Hey.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.441
Are you okay?

18:29.858 --> 18:32.194
-I'm fine.
-Let's talk a little.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.029
She works here, right?

18:34.988 --> 18:36.448
She owes us...

18:36.532 --> 18:38.659
-Let's talk outside. Please.
-Get away!

18:40.536 --> 18:41.954
-You jerk.
-What is this jerk...

18:44.456 --> 18:45.457
What are you doing?

18:50.838 --> 18:51.922
Are you okay?

18:54.216 --> 18:55.217
Hey.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.219
-Are you crazy?
-Please.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.179
-Please...
-Do you like her?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.056
Answer me, lady.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.724
Did you get yourself a man?

19:03.350 --> 19:05.310
I said to sell your body
to pay off your debt.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.605
You were wasting your energy.

19:09.898 --> 19:10.899
Seung-ju!

19:15.612 --> 19:16.613
Seung-ju!

19:16.864 --> 19:17.865
Are you crazy?

19:19.700 --> 19:20.701
What are you doing?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.578
Get back to work. The food is burning.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.166
Oh my! The compensation guy!

19:27.583 --> 19:29.168
It's been a while.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.044
-Please leave--
-Let go!

19:32.754 --> 19:33.755
Are you here to eat?

19:34.047 --> 19:35.048
Let's talk outside.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.341
What?

19:36.592 --> 19:38.760
This woman borrowed money
but won't pay it back.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.053
Okay?

19:40.262 --> 19:41.555
What should I do?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.056
I want money, not flowers.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.641
What should I do?

19:46.935 --> 19:48.187
That punk.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.356
That's enough.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.443
Fine. Let go.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.079
He's tough.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.673
I'm sorry. Please let go.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.816
I'm sorry.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.412
Give it to me. I'll do it.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.665
Why didn't you say my cousin put you
in this huge debt?

20:50.123 --> 20:51.250
What's the point?

20:51.959 --> 20:53.335
You should've asked for help instead of

20:53.418 --> 20:55.837
-trying to solve it on your own.
-Help with what?

20:56.421 --> 20:57.547
Your face is a mess.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.011
Why did you get involved in the fight?

21:03.387 --> 21:05.097
I'm taking care of it. Don't worry.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.975
Thanks for caring,

21:08.433 --> 21:09.726
but I can handle it.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.230
Don't tell your aunt.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.564
And don't tell her you saw me.

21:21.780 --> 21:22.906
Excuse me.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.625
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.169
I'll resign as of today.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.171
I'll pay for any damages.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.423
I'm truly sorry.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.386
Excuse me.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.555
Here.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.017
I thought I should return this.

21:50.767 --> 21:51.852
You seem mistaken

21:52.602 --> 21:54.396
about that car accident,

21:55.230 --> 21:57.607
but I have no reason to accept
this compensation.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.484
Well then.

21:59.818 --> 22:00.819
Goodbye.

22:02.237 --> 22:05.032
I don't think you're in any position
to return this.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.205
It's okay.

22:12.914 --> 22:13.915
This is this,

22:14.791 --> 22:16.168
and my problem is my problem.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.170
Goodbye, then.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.062
Kim Mi-jeong?

22:35.187 --> 22:36.188
Yes.

22:39.566 --> 22:40.609
Please have a seat.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.369
Well...

22:51.495 --> 22:53.622
Excuse me, but how old...

22:53.914 --> 22:55.582
How old are you?

22:55.749 --> 22:58.460
I'm 46 years old.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.588
I do hear

23:01.671 --> 23:03.757
that I look young

23:03.840 --> 23:07.135
for my age all the time.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.888
So if people see us together...

23:12.099 --> 23:13.100
Excuse me.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.105
What?

23:18.271 --> 23:19.815
Why do you keep calling?

23:19.940 --> 23:21.566
I'll kill you.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.498
She doesn't look young for her age.

23:37.541 --> 23:40.210
Would the hospital believe
that we've been dating for a while?

23:41.837 --> 23:43.130
You're right.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.884
We really can't trust those brokers.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.719
He said she was perfect.

23:49.845 --> 23:50.846
Call the others.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.813
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.190
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

24:06.194 --> 24:09.865
This deposit is hardly anything.
Why do you want me to pull it out?

24:10.365 --> 24:11.575
Are you that desperate for cash?

24:12.826 --> 24:13.827
Thank you.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.498
I need to at least pay the interest first.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.167
You poor thing.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.751
Do you have a place to go?

24:22.335 --> 24:23.420
Don't worry.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.213
Where's Eun-seong?

24:25.797 --> 24:28.008
She's been playing at my place.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.552
Eun-seong, your mom's here.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.182
What's this?

24:35.515 --> 24:36.892
Where did she go?

24:37.392 --> 24:39.519
-She isn't there?
-No.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.064
Eun-seong.

24:43.857 --> 24:44.858
Eun-seong.

24:45.901 --> 24:46.902
Eun-seong.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.196
Eun-seong.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.449
Eun-seong?

24:54.034 --> 24:55.035
Eun-seong.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.455
Congratulations on your new job, Mom.

25:18.850 --> 25:19.935
How did it go?

25:20.393 --> 25:22.562
Was everyone shocked by your food?

25:23.688 --> 25:25.315
Of course.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.067
Congratulations.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.653
Blow out the candle.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.199
Let's do it together.

25:34.658 --> 25:37.285
Okay. One, two, three.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.290
I'll take this out.

25:44.960 --> 25:45.961
All done.

25:47.254 --> 25:48.964
-Eun-seong.
-You first.

25:49.422 --> 25:50.423
Me first?

26:00.934 --> 26:01.935
It's yummy.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.062
Thank you.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.657
You cute little thing.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.147
Marry me.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.692
I'll marry you.

26:54.529 --> 26:55.530
Ji-hun.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.408
Is the director
single-handedly bringing up the sales?

27:00.577 --> 27:02.287
-What are you doing here?
-Na-yoon.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.748
I didn't get to formally
introduce you last time.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.333
This is my brother, Ji-hun.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.461
Nice to meet you.

27:10.962 --> 27:11.963
Hello.

27:13.548 --> 27:14.883
Do you want to go upstairs?

27:15.925 --> 27:17.552
Punk. Why are you so nervous?

27:17.761 --> 27:19.095
She's that pretty, isn't she?

27:19.471 --> 27:20.472
Bring out a bottle of wine.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.931
I'm going to wash my hands.

27:32.942 --> 27:33.943
It's been a while.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.487
It has.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.740
It's nice to see you like this

27:39.491 --> 27:40.617
in this odd situation.

27:46.247 --> 27:47.457
Did you quit music?

27:47.832 --> 27:48.875
When?

27:49.167 --> 27:50.210
What music?

27:51.419 --> 27:52.796
I was just immature.

27:56.257 --> 27:58.718
Your dad was so picky,
yet he's okay with you

27:59.636 --> 28:00.804
being the second marriage?

28:01.971 --> 28:03.390
What does your family gain?

28:04.641 --> 28:05.892
My father doesn't say anything,

28:06.601 --> 28:07.685
so I know nothing.

28:09.270 --> 28:10.772
You have no right to say that.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.024
How could you say that?

28:14.275 --> 28:16.194
You said you were an orphan
without a home or family.

28:16.277 --> 28:17.695
You're the one who left first too.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.948
It isn't my fault we met like this.

28:22.992 --> 28:26.037
The restaurant is so empty,
don't you think?

28:26.121 --> 28:27.122
Where are the customers?

28:27.205 --> 28:28.748
At this hour?

28:29.082 --> 28:30.792
We're turning people away at the door.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.753
-Don't worry.
-Punk. You never let me win once.

28:34.462 --> 28:37.298
That's right.
Na-yoon has a performance this weekend.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.050
Bring someone if you can.

28:40.593 --> 28:41.594
Sure.

28:42.178 --> 28:44.472
Why won't you get married?

28:44.597 --> 28:46.224
I'm sure plenty of women are after you.

28:47.058 --> 28:50.019
There's a limit to partying
with random girls.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.604
It's time to settle down.

28:52.897 --> 28:53.898
Yes.

28:54.482 --> 28:55.483
I'll consider it.

28:55.608 --> 28:58.445
Na-yoon, he and I may have
different mothers,

28:58.653 --> 28:59.904
but I adore him like a lot.

29:00.905 --> 29:03.032
Were you 12 when you first came?

29:03.324 --> 29:04.325
That first day he came,

29:04.492 --> 29:07.078
he cried all day
in the corner of his room.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.581
I felt so sorry for him.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.876
He's all grown up now.

29:13.918 --> 29:14.919
I never said this before,

29:15.170 --> 29:17.505
but do you know how hard
it was for Mother because of you?

29:17.922 --> 29:19.716
You'd run away and disappear.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.509
When we sent him abroad to study,

29:21.760 --> 29:23.595
he got into music
and just partied with girls.

29:25.346 --> 29:26.806
Why are you bringing up the past?

29:39.027 --> 29:40.820
-I'm fine.
-But you like wine...

29:45.992 --> 29:48.203
Don't all beautiful women like wine?

29:49.037 --> 29:51.706
She doesn't look like she'd drink
soju or makgeolli.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.082
Don't you agree?

29:53.958 --> 29:55.585
You're so random.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.222
Hello? How's my mother?

30:08.389 --> 30:09.933
She's struggling.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.768
Her blood pressure keeps dropping.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.229
She just barely fell asleep.

30:16.564 --> 30:17.565
I see.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.025
I'll stop by next morning.

30:19.943 --> 30:20.944
Okay.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.997
RÉSUMÉ, KANG HYE-SU

31:16.583 --> 31:17.584
Who are you?

31:20.670 --> 31:22.881
Does Kang Hye-su live here?

31:23.047 --> 31:24.465
Why are you looking for her?

31:25.091 --> 31:26.092
What is it?

31:28.344 --> 31:29.971
I don't know what it is,

31:30.638 --> 31:31.890
but they moved.

31:31.973 --> 31:35.435
They moved a long time ago,
so don't come back.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.478
They moved already?

31:38.354 --> 31:39.355
Get lost!

31:39.439 --> 31:42.400
Must you torture someone
who works so hard to raise a child?

31:42.692 --> 31:46.112
Why is a young man doing
something like that?

31:46.946 --> 31:50.366
Because of your heinous actions,
you're going to be punished.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.118
I said leave!

31:52.201 --> 31:54.996
I told you, she moved! You jerk.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.167
Gosh.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.767
We'll move in a bit.

32:31.366 --> 32:32.867
Let's eat first.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.661
-Hye-su, eat with us.
-Okay.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.709
HIRING, CLUB DIAMOND

32:42.585 --> 32:44.128
GUARANTEED TEN MILLION WON
MAKE EASY MONEY

32:49.467 --> 32:50.677
Gosh.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.221
Why are you...

32:54.222 --> 32:55.682
Can we go somewhere to talk?

32:57.141 --> 32:58.476
What is it?

32:58.559 --> 32:59.769
I still have work to do.

32:59.852 --> 33:00.853
Let's go.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.563
I don't have time to kill here.

33:03.731 --> 33:05.483
Wait.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.364
Excuse me.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.076
This place is a bit...

33:15.576 --> 33:17.412
I just needed somewhere quiet to talk.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.372
Don't be lame and follow me.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.184
I don't have time,
so I'll just cut to the chase.

33:40.935 --> 33:43.062
That offer you made me...

33:43.813 --> 33:45.189
When you said you'd marry me...

33:45.898 --> 33:48.151
Does that still stand?

33:49.277 --> 33:50.278
Pardon?

33:52.155 --> 33:53.489
Let me organize the facts.

33:53.990 --> 33:56.242
My mom has cirrhosis
and desperately needs a liver transplant.

33:56.784 --> 33:58.619
I can't do that
because my blood type doesn't match.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.997
I must find a match within the family,

34:01.330 --> 34:03.207
so I need a woman to marry on paper.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.668
You overheard that much, right?

34:08.046 --> 34:09.130
Yes.

34:09.756 --> 34:10.965
It won't be easy.

34:11.591 --> 34:12.884
It's illegal and dangerous.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.344
You might end up in jail.

34:16.345 --> 34:17.430
Can you do it?

34:21.851 --> 34:22.852
What?

34:25.021 --> 34:28.024
Your mother must be
in extreme peril for you to--

34:28.107 --> 34:30.151
That's none of your concern.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.235
Stay out of it.

34:34.614 --> 34:35.615
How much do you want?

34:36.866 --> 34:37.992
How much debt do you have?

34:38.576 --> 34:40.286
A hundred million won?
Two hundred million won?

34:44.207 --> 34:45.208
Fine.

34:46.209 --> 34:47.627
You must be embarrassed to say,

34:48.169 --> 34:49.337
so we can negotiate that later.

34:49.962 --> 34:50.963
First,

34:51.339 --> 34:53.049
you need to get tested
to see if you're a match.

34:54.175 --> 34:55.301
You can do it now, right?

34:57.887 --> 34:58.888
No.

34:59.472 --> 35:00.932
I need to think it over.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.850
What? The amount?

35:03.184 --> 35:04.393
No, not that.

35:05.686 --> 35:07.522
It's all so sudden.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.816
You made the offer first.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.776
I did.

35:12.276 --> 35:13.569
I did offer,

35:14.612 --> 35:16.697
but I need time to think it over.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.034
Time to think it over?

35:21.869 --> 35:22.870
Sorry.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.288
I don't have that time.

35:26.833 --> 35:27.834
If you're doing this

35:28.000 --> 35:29.627
to ask for more money,

35:30.044 --> 35:31.921
I'll give it to you. Just say the amount.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.297
Listen.

35:33.881 --> 35:37.135
It's true that I need money,
but that's not why I need the time.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.262
I have a child.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.181
Let's be honest.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.393
If it's about your child,
you really should do it.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.817
I understand you're in a rush
because of your mother,

35:53.651 --> 35:55.361
but I don't like how you speak.

35:55.486 --> 35:57.488
Aren't you in a rush to get the money?

35:58.614 --> 35:59.949
Was it Club Diamond?

36:00.408 --> 36:02.493
"Guaranteed ten million won."
Weren't you looking at that?

36:03.327 --> 36:04.996
This can't be worse than that.

36:05.454 --> 36:07.248
-Excuse me.
-This may be

36:07.331 --> 36:10.168
your one chance to escape
from this wretched life.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.335
"Wretched"?

36:12.086 --> 36:13.337
Did you say "wretched"?

36:13.462 --> 36:15.840
If you had to use a loan shark,
haven't you hit rock bottom?

36:16.299 --> 36:18.217
You're thinking of working at a bar.
Why hesitate?

36:18.342 --> 36:19.343
What about you?

36:19.886 --> 36:21.888
How can you trust someone
who has hit rock bottom?

36:22.054 --> 36:23.181
I can tell.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.726
You took over your late husband's debt

36:27.018 --> 36:28.978
because you live like that.

36:30.354 --> 36:33.524
There's a thin line
between being naive and being foolish.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.114
Don't talk
about another person's life like that.

36:40.281 --> 36:44.577
Rock bottom
is what they call people like you!

36:48.456 --> 36:49.498
I won't do this.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.376
I've changed my mind, so look elsewhere.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.378
There are plenty of other people

36:54.462 --> 36:56.005
who have hit rock bottom besides me.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.382
I'm busy, so I must get going.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.028
Hye-su.

37:19.278 --> 37:20.279
Let go.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.031
Ji-hun.

37:29.622 --> 37:30.623
Please take them.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.209
Who is she?

37:35.169 --> 37:38.422
You shouldn't come to the hotel
during business hours.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.842
Do you only pretend to work
in front of Dad?

37:42.593 --> 37:44.428
I thought you got your act together.

37:44.762 --> 37:45.763
Was that an act?

38:00.194 --> 38:01.195
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.678
You took over your late husband's debt

38:26.012 --> 38:28.097
because you live like that.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.518
There's a thin line
between being naive and being foolish.

38:36.522 --> 38:37.857
Ring me up, please.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.150
Okay.

39:00.755 --> 39:01.756
What time is it?

39:06.427 --> 39:07.887
Did you work all night?

39:10.097 --> 39:11.098
Sleep more.

39:11.223 --> 39:12.224
Sleep. Sorry.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.729
You're working too hard.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.940
-Hye-su.
-Yes?

39:20.107 --> 39:23.235
When you come in,
can you close the door lightly?

39:23.361 --> 39:24.612
Sorry, Ju-yeon.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.113
You can't sleep because of me.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.741
Don't say things like that.

39:29.658 --> 39:32.286
Gosh, I've been having insomnia lately.

39:33.329 --> 39:34.455
I'm going to sleep.

39:34.538 --> 39:35.956
-Sorry.
-Get some sleep too.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.210
Good night.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.468
I did good.

39:48.469 --> 39:49.595
I did the right thing.

39:50.763 --> 39:51.764
Right?

40:02.108 --> 40:03.567
The right thing? Who am I kidding?

40:05.569 --> 40:07.405
I'm making my daughter live like this.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.574
Mom.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.410
Are you awake?

40:13.661 --> 40:14.662
Give me a kiss.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.499
Sleep.

40:33.556 --> 40:34.598
Hello.

40:34.723 --> 40:35.724
I'll be right in.

40:36.350 --> 40:37.726
Mr. Han!

40:38.144 --> 40:39.437
Ji-hun.

40:40.980 --> 40:41.981
How did it go yesterday?

40:42.481 --> 40:43.649
Did it go well?

40:46.026 --> 40:47.528
What?

40:47.653 --> 40:48.779
She won't do it?

40:49.238 --> 40:51.157
Hye-su won't do it?

40:51.574 --> 40:52.867
Why not? Why?

40:53.909 --> 40:56.370
True, it isn't easy to sell
your liver for money!

40:56.495 --> 40:57.621
She's a mom too.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.877
Why don't you grab a megaphone
and announce it to the world?

41:11.385 --> 41:13.512
His temper is uncontrollable.

41:13.637 --> 41:14.889
You're lucky I'm so patient.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.474
That punk.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.642
It's so cold.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.193
Have you eaten?

41:27.985 --> 41:30.070
This is more like it.

41:30.362 --> 41:31.572
I got the money.

41:31.947 --> 41:34.074
I'm so very happy.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.369
You'll pay me every month, right?

41:37.745 --> 41:38.746
Right?

41:40.372 --> 41:41.832
Fine.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.793
So don't come to my workplace again.

41:46.045 --> 41:49.757
If you show up again,
I won't forgive you either!

41:50.674 --> 41:52.384
Why are you getting angry?

41:52.510 --> 41:54.595
Fine. You scared me.

41:54.678 --> 41:55.679
Later.

41:58.098 --> 41:59.099
Hey, lady!

41:59.391 --> 42:00.768
Be careful walking home. It's dark.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.770
And clean the store nice and well.

42:02.895 --> 42:04.104
Good girl!

42:25.626 --> 42:27.711
HIRING A COOK

42:27.920 --> 42:29.463
Eat up.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.257
That looks good.

42:31.507 --> 42:32.967
Aren't you going to work?

42:33.634 --> 42:34.635
I'm taking the day off.

42:37.096 --> 42:38.097
Good thinking.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.891
Even if you're strapped for cash,

42:40.975 --> 42:43.018
you need to think of your health.

42:43.143 --> 42:44.979
You're not made of steel.
You'll die that way.

42:51.986 --> 42:54.405
A chef's food is definitely
on another level.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.323
This is waking me right up.

42:56.615 --> 42:57.950
Live here forever.

43:01.287 --> 43:02.413
-Ju-yeon.
-Yes?

43:02.538 --> 43:04.123
Let's take just one sip each.

43:04.290 --> 43:05.791
Why do you suddenly want to drink?

43:05.874 --> 43:06.875
You can't even drink.

43:06.959 --> 43:07.960
Let's drink.

43:09.169 --> 43:10.170
Ju-yeon.

43:11.922 --> 43:14.675
I really wanted to make Eun-seong happy.

43:15.342 --> 43:16.677
I wanted to repay the debt

43:17.261 --> 43:18.637
and open a pretty restaurant

43:18.721 --> 43:21.307
and live happily with Eun-seong.
That was my dream.

43:22.766 --> 43:24.476
Am I asking for a lot?

43:24.602 --> 43:25.853
You can still do it.

43:25.978 --> 43:26.979
Why not?

43:28.397 --> 43:29.398
You're right.

43:30.149 --> 43:31.150
I can still do it.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.319
I can still do it.

43:34.486 --> 43:35.487
What's wrong?

43:35.779 --> 43:37.197
Did those men come back?

43:37.406 --> 43:39.408
Although you withdrew your deposit
and paid them interest?

43:45.581 --> 43:48.292
I've been wanting to take just one sip
since yesterday.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.502
I'm going to have just one sip.

43:51.545 --> 43:54.006
I've wanted to rebel since yesterday.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.132
Against who?

43:59.970 --> 44:00.971
Hey!

44:01.388 --> 44:04.433
You got a defective can.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.559
Goodness me.

44:06.226 --> 44:07.436
Drink this.

44:18.656 --> 44:19.657
Hye-su.

44:26.580 --> 44:29.583
Even this little can of beer isn't
on my side.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.753
It's so unfair.

44:33.629 --> 44:34.630
Right?

44:35.547 --> 44:37.091
It's so unfair.

44:38.050 --> 44:39.510
What's wrong?

44:40.844 --> 44:41.845
Hye-su,

44:42.262 --> 44:43.472
are you drunk already?

44:48.602 --> 44:49.978
What's wrong?

44:51.105 --> 44:52.398
Fine.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.486
I'm taking life head-on.

45:01.907 --> 45:04.284
I won't fall apart.

45:06.286 --> 45:08.705
I'm Eun-seong's mom.

45:30.561 --> 45:31.562
Mom!

45:32.104 --> 45:33.689
Mom.

45:34.565 --> 45:36.942
I just wanted to see you before I went.

45:37.025 --> 45:38.026
Really?

45:39.862 --> 45:43.073
Hopping and hopping!

45:43.240 --> 45:45.033
Hop and hop!

45:45.284 --> 45:47.953
Hopping and hopping!

45:57.212 --> 45:58.755
I'll see you later, Mom.

45:58.881 --> 45:59.882
See you later.

46:00.883 --> 46:01.884
Good luck.

46:06.763 --> 46:07.764
Yes.

46:07.848 --> 46:09.641
I came to get a physical check-up.

46:09.766 --> 46:11.518
I just need my employment history, right?

46:12.519 --> 46:14.354
Yes, I can start any time.

46:14.938 --> 46:16.648
Thank you. I'll be there soon.

46:16.773 --> 46:17.774
Thank you.

46:18.734 --> 46:19.776
Thank you.

46:20.777 --> 46:21.778
Excuse me.

46:22.613 --> 46:23.864
You got an MRI

46:23.947 --> 46:26.158
after a car accident last week,
didn't you?

46:26.658 --> 46:27.826
Yes, I did.

46:28.202 --> 46:29.995
You didn't come back to see the results.

46:30.245 --> 46:31.622
Didn't you get the text message?

46:31.955 --> 46:33.499
I've been busy.

46:33.790 --> 46:35.083
Once you're done with your checkup,

46:35.167 --> 46:36.960
you should go meet with the doctor.

46:37.794 --> 46:39.880
Was there something bad?

46:41.215 --> 46:42.716
Do you see this

46:43.383 --> 46:44.468
white area?

46:45.344 --> 46:46.345
Yes.

46:46.637 --> 46:48.180
There is a tumor there.

46:49.681 --> 46:53.769
Do you get migraines or feel nauseous
during your everyday life?

46:55.270 --> 46:56.271
A tumor?

46:58.315 --> 47:01.193
I never felt sick, Doctor.

47:01.276 --> 47:03.278
You may not have symptoms
since it's in its early stages.

47:03.362 --> 47:04.905
When it's this small,

47:04.988 --> 47:07.032
people often don't notice.

47:08.158 --> 47:10.869
You were lucky you found it early
thanks to the car accident.

47:12.829 --> 47:14.873
This little thing is bad?

47:15.332 --> 47:17.125
You should start treatment right away.

47:17.709 --> 47:18.710
Do I need

47:19.127 --> 47:21.171
to get surgery and stuff?

47:22.923 --> 47:25.008
I wish we could remove it with surgery,

47:25.884 --> 47:28.929
but it's located in a dangerous spot.

47:29.638 --> 47:31.848
Let's start with radiation therapy.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.018
Excuse me,

47:37.020 --> 47:38.689
but what if this gets bigger?

47:39.690 --> 47:41.024
If it gets bigger,

47:42.901 --> 47:44.027
would I die?

47:44.570 --> 47:47.656
I should talk to your guardian about how
we should proceed with your treatment.

47:48.031 --> 47:50.284
Bring your guardian next time you come.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.286
No, Doctor.

47:53.161 --> 47:55.080
Will I die, Doctor?

48:00.961 --> 48:03.088
I can't give you an exact percentage

48:03.171 --> 48:05.090
but your chance of survival isn't high.

48:34.369 --> 48:35.579
Mom.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.081
Mom.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.917
Mom!

48:41.501 --> 48:43.086
Mom!

48:45.088 --> 48:46.590
Mom!

48:47.507 --> 48:49.051
Mom!

48:50.385 --> 48:52.012
Mom!

48:55.015 --> 48:56.642
Mom!

48:57.809 --> 48:59.227
Mom!

49:01.688 --> 49:03.357
Mom!

49:05.275 --> 49:06.777
Mom!

49:09.655 --> 49:11.490
Mom!

50:01.707 --> 50:03.458
KANG HYE-SU

50:12.426 --> 50:14.594
The person you are trying
to reach cannot...

50:23.562 --> 50:24.604
You must have been hungry.

50:32.195 --> 50:33.196
Hey.

50:33.989 --> 50:34.990
What are you doing here?

50:36.366 --> 50:38.118
I came to see my mom.

50:38.994 --> 50:40.829
She works here.

50:41.788 --> 50:42.789
Your mom?

50:43.623 --> 50:44.916
What's her name?

50:45.041 --> 50:46.042
Kang Hye-su.

50:46.543 --> 50:47.794
She's a chef.

50:47.919 --> 50:50.589
She's the best chef here.

51:03.769 --> 51:04.936
-So...
-Yes?

51:05.061 --> 51:06.563
Where's my mom?

51:06.646 --> 51:08.440
Your mom...

51:09.149 --> 51:11.610
Your mom went out with the chef for a bit.

51:12.235 --> 51:13.737
She went grocery shopping.

51:13.862 --> 51:15.155
She'll be late.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.115
I see.

51:18.325 --> 51:19.576
Want more ice cream, Eun-seong?

51:19.868 --> 51:21.411
How do you know my name?

51:25.123 --> 51:26.208
Hold on.

51:29.419 --> 51:31.671
You should just give up.

51:31.880 --> 51:34.633
If she wanted to do it,
why would she ignore your calls?

51:35.884 --> 51:36.885
Did you

51:37.302 --> 51:39.805
upset Hye-su by any chance?

51:39.930 --> 51:41.973
You did, didn't you? You did.

51:42.057 --> 51:43.183
It's obvious.

51:51.316 --> 51:52.442
You.

51:52.526 --> 51:54.277
Why are you here?

51:55.946 --> 51:57.197
Why are you here?

51:57.614 --> 51:59.115
I asked first.

51:59.950 --> 52:00.951
Who is she?

52:03.662 --> 52:04.788
Did you come with your mom?

52:07.541 --> 52:08.542
Hey.

52:20.303 --> 52:21.888
-Hey!
-Are you hurt?

52:25.350 --> 52:26.852
Loser.

52:26.935 --> 52:27.978
Why that...

52:32.190 --> 52:33.525
What are you doing?

52:33.608 --> 52:35.861
Okay. Get up.

52:48.498 --> 52:51.418
Her child is so young. How did she
end up with such a big debt?

52:52.168 --> 52:53.128
Bye!

52:53.920 --> 52:56.715
-Bye!
-That poor thing.

52:58.967 --> 53:00.051
My goodness.

53:00.969 --> 53:02.095
That's enough.

53:03.763 --> 53:05.098
Seriously.

53:35.879 --> 53:38.548
HEART NAIL

53:54.606 --> 53:55.941
Eun-seong!

53:56.024 --> 53:58.485
-Mom!
-Come give me a hug.

53:59.444 --> 54:00.820
My baby!

54:00.946 --> 54:02.697
What are you doing out here, Eun-seong?

54:03.448 --> 54:04.449
Why are you outside?

54:04.741 --> 54:06.409
Why are you home so early?

54:08.119 --> 54:09.496
Are you happy I came home early?

54:09.621 --> 54:11.247
Of course, I am.

54:12.749 --> 54:14.709
My mom's home.

54:14.834 --> 54:16.044
I was bored.

54:16.252 --> 54:17.545
You cute thing.

54:25.387 --> 54:26.846
How much did you miss me?

54:26.930 --> 54:27.931
One hundred percent.

54:28.181 --> 54:30.183
I missed you this much.

54:30.308 --> 54:31.309
This much.

54:31.601 --> 54:32.602
Give me a kiss.

54:33.728 --> 54:34.729
My baby.

54:38.316 --> 54:39.317
Do you want some?

54:40.402 --> 54:41.444
I'll give it to you.

54:42.195 --> 54:44.114
Your restaurant is really nice.

54:46.366 --> 54:47.450
You went there alone?

54:48.326 --> 54:49.494
Just a minute!

54:51.037 --> 54:53.456
You weren't coming home,

54:54.082 --> 54:56.084
so I walked little by little

54:56.167 --> 54:57.419
and ended up all the way there.

54:58.712 --> 55:00.255
It's not far at all.

55:00.380 --> 55:02.132
You shouldn't go by yourself.

55:03.174 --> 55:04.676
Do you want to get in trouble?

55:04.968 --> 55:06.678
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

55:09.264 --> 55:12.475
If you keep doing this,
I'll be too worried to go to work.

55:12.600 --> 55:14.185
Sorry.

55:14.310 --> 55:17.272
But some man knew me.

55:17.480 --> 55:18.982
He said he saw me when I was a baby.

55:19.065 --> 55:20.567
He gave me ice cream too.

55:20.692 --> 55:21.985
He was super cool.

55:23.236 --> 55:24.738
The tall man?

55:24.863 --> 55:25.989
Yes, the tall man.

55:26.489 --> 55:28.283
How does he know me?

55:29.701 --> 55:30.869
Have some more soup.

55:44.716 --> 55:45.800
What are you doing?

55:47.510 --> 55:48.511
I got caught.

55:49.929 --> 55:50.930
Give it to me.

55:51.056 --> 55:52.057
Why are you packing that?

55:54.726 --> 55:57.896
There's a kitten by your restaurant.

55:58.021 --> 55:59.147
I feel bad for it.

55:59.939 --> 56:01.149
I don't think it has a mom.

56:02.108 --> 56:03.443
It's all skinny

56:03.526 --> 56:05.945
and crying because it's hungry.

56:06.154 --> 56:07.697
I want to be its mom.

56:08.448 --> 56:10.492
It loved the sausage I gave it.

56:10.825 --> 56:11.910
It's really pretty.

56:14.496 --> 56:16.581
I wish I could raise it at home.

56:19.834 --> 56:20.835
Mom?

56:21.628 --> 56:22.629
Okay.

56:23.088 --> 56:25.340
Eat first. I'll pack this for you.

56:25.799 --> 56:27.258
Really? I can take it?

56:27.675 --> 56:28.676
Yes.

56:28.927 --> 56:29.928
I'm so excited.

56:36.935 --> 56:38.978
DIRECTOR HAN

56:40.855 --> 56:41.856
Eat.

56:41.940 --> 56:45.276
The person you are trying
to reach cannot answer the phone.

56:56.329 --> 56:58.289
Hey!

56:58.623 --> 56:59.791
-Calm down!
-Let go!

56:59.916 --> 57:02.168
Hey! Calm down!

57:02.252 --> 57:03.628
Calm down.

57:03.711 --> 57:04.712
Calm down.

57:08.842 --> 57:09.843
Hey.

57:10.260 --> 57:12.846
It's not easy finding out her address.

57:12.971 --> 57:14.514
Had I known,

57:14.597 --> 57:16.891
I would've followed that little girl.

57:16.975 --> 57:17.851
Forget it.

57:18.726 --> 57:19.686
Let's give up

57:20.270 --> 57:21.521
and find another woman.

57:22.397 --> 57:23.606
Why...

57:24.441 --> 57:25.442
Why are you...

57:26.651 --> 57:27.777
Maybe it's Hye-su.

57:34.451 --> 57:36.953
-Hello?
-You need to come to the hospital.

57:37.036 --> 57:38.580
Your mother is not doing well.

57:38.663 --> 57:40.165
SEUNGJIN HOSPITAL

57:48.923 --> 57:49.924
Goodness.

57:56.931 --> 57:58.475
She just fell asleep.

57:58.892 --> 58:00.768
She bled a little earlier.

58:00.894 --> 58:02.353
She was looking for you.

58:22.916 --> 58:23.917
Will...

58:24.250 --> 58:26.085
Will I die, Doctor?

58:27.545 --> 58:29.839
Your chance of survival isn't high,

58:29.923 --> 58:31.799
although I can't give you
an exact percentage.

59:42.078 --> 59:43.204
My gosh.

1:00:17.780 --> 1:00:19.073
How can you smile?

1:00:20.491 --> 1:00:21.826
I hate you.

1:00:26.539 --> 1:00:28.499
I hate you even more today.

1:00:38.968 --> 1:00:41.346
Can't you help me?

1:03:02.236 --> 1:03:03.237
What do you want?

1:03:04.572 --> 1:03:05.573
Did you regret

1:03:06.532 --> 1:03:07.533
declining the offer?

1:03:08.326 --> 1:03:09.327
Yes.

1:03:09.952 --> 1:03:11.329
What do I need to do first?

1:03:12.789 --> 1:03:14.499
Do we start with the marriage license?

1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:17.335
We should draw up the contract first.

1:03:18.961 --> 1:03:19.962
How much do you want?

1:03:22.715 --> 1:03:23.716
Tell me.

1:03:24.675 --> 1:03:25.676
How much do you want?

1:03:29.555 --> 1:03:30.848
Give me a lot.

1:03:34.101 --> 1:03:37.021
Enough to use
until my daughter grows up...

1:03:39.524 --> 1:03:41.150
and can survive on her own.

1:04:15.601 --> 1:04:17.645
We've been dating for two years.

1:04:17.728 --> 1:04:19.564
Don't tell Ji-hun.

1:04:19.647 --> 1:04:20.940
Can you come to the hospital?

1:04:21.023 --> 1:04:23.150
Your mom called Hye-su to the hospital.

1:04:23.276 --> 1:04:26.529
Why is my mom together with that man?

1:04:26.612 --> 1:04:28.948
-Did you bring your seal?
-I won't run away.

1:04:29.031 --> 1:04:31.242
Have you two really dated for a long time?

1:04:31.325 --> 1:04:33.244
Do you love Ji-hun?

1:04:33.327 --> 1:04:34.412
Stay at my place for a while.

1:04:34.537 --> 1:04:36.539
It won't look good to the others.

1:04:36.664 --> 1:04:38.082
This isn't a game.

1:04:38.165 --> 1:04:39.834
This is a conspiracy to commit a crime.

1:04:40.167 --> 1:04:42.169
