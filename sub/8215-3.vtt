00:05.330 --> 00:07.264
REPORTER :
Fallout tonight

00:07.300 --> 00:09.109
as the case against
NSA Deputy Director,

00:09.140 --> 00:11.108
General Calvin Claridge,
continues to unfold.

00:11.140 --> 00:14.109
The general's office
has denied the existence of

00:14.140 --> 00:16.404
any romantic e-mails
between himself

00:16.450 --> 00:17.303
and female Yemini intern,

00:17.350 --> 00:20.740
Hoda Amin,
even though WHN has acquired

00:22.720 --> 00:25.518
This, after a suggestive photo
of the intern in his office

00:25.550 --> 00:27.415
was released by our own
Annabel Parker

00:27.460 --> 00:29.382
here at World Headline Now,

00:29.430 --> 00:32.524
creating a firestorm of negative
publicity for the general

00:32.560 --> 00:36.291
and putting his nomination
as head of the CIA at risk.

00:36.330 --> 00:37.763
To Annabel.
Hey, Annabel.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.530
Mmm!

00:40.570 --> 00:42.606
Here.
Oh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

00:42.640 --> 00:43.732
Come on...

00:43.770 --> 00:45.260
you guys call yourselves
journalists?

00:45.310 --> 00:46.572
I'm done.
Yeah. Me, too.

00:46.610 --> 00:48.475
I'll take two shots,
if you tell me

00:48.510 --> 00:50.546
where you got the picture
in the first place.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.616
Uh, she won't even tell me
and I'm her boss.

00:52.650 --> 00:54.641
I'm happy for you,
Annabel.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.545
I really am.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.581
You worked hard for this.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.087
Well, thanks.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.350
But I'm still not
going home with you.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.857
Come on.

01:05.890 --> 01:07.721
(speaks low,
indistinctly)

01:24.580 --> 01:27.140
You boys look like
you're ready to party.

01:28.750 --> 01:32.686
That we have a long history
of breaking major stories.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.587
The Claridge scandal
hasn't been our only success.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.258
The network was struggling

01:37.290 --> 01:38.655
with viewership
for a long time, yes.
Ah.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.669
Triple 18!

01:42.700 --> 01:44.361
That's 54.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.265
Mark it.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.562
Hello?

01:47.600 --> 01:48.692
Got to mark it. Mark it.

01:48.740 --> 01:49.661
Sorry. I've got a friend
If...

01:49.710 --> 01:51.166
in Claridge's office.

01:51.210 --> 01:53.804
This scandal's got to be
a giant headache.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.638
Yeah, well, he'll probably be
looking for a new job soon.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.874
Your turn.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.377
Sorry, boyo.
What?

01:59.420 --> 02:00.819
We got to call it even.

02:00.850 --> 02:02.647
MAN 2:
Wait, what

02:02.690 --> 02:03.748
Someone erased the score.
I don't know what happened.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.189
Oh, "someone"?
Yeah, it was you.
Get out of here.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.756
What?!

02:06.790 --> 02:07.586
You're always
erasing the score.

02:07.620 --> 02:08.609
Hey, shut up!
Hey...

02:11.830 --> 02:13.650
It's because I'm up.
I was up by a lot.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.292
He's right.
He was.

02:15.330 --> 02:17.491
By 152, to be exact.

02:17.530 --> 02:18.827
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.337
I also know
you failed to score

02:20.370 --> 02:21.598
your buddy's last three shots.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.460
A21, a 16

02:23.510 --> 02:24.738
and a 19, which brings
your total score

02:24.770 --> 02:26.499
to 286.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.201
And you need to tuck your elbow
further under the dart.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.470
You had
three wall hits

02:30.510 --> 02:31.670
and punctured
the beer sign. Twice.

02:31.710 --> 02:33.940
What are you,
the dart police?

02:33.980 --> 02:35.948
Yeah. I show up whenever
anyone sucks at darts.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.618
Come on, come on.

02:37.650 --> 02:39.186
Want to go
Want to go?
Please...

02:39.220 --> 02:41.518
can you give your highly
superior memory a break

02:41.560 --> 02:42.857
while we
try to relax?

02:42.890 --> 02:44.778
I... I never relax,
you know this.

02:44.830 --> 02:46.627
I do.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.548
Am I winning?
You don't remember?

02:48.600 --> 02:51.228
I'm winning.

02:59.540 --> 03:00.837
MAN:
You can't cross here.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.609
Get back.

03:03.650 --> 03:04.878
MAN:
All right, make some room.

03:04.910 --> 03:06.309
Make some room for them.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.840
Right here!
Look over here!

03:07.880 --> 03:08.915
Back, get back.

03:10.450 --> 03:13.385
Hey, folks, you got
to clear the door.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.716
JAY:
Hey, guys.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.728
Welcome to the
greatest show on earth.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.796
Send in the clowns.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.620
The victim was found
by housekeeping

03:25.670 --> 03:27.968
when they
came around to clean.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.604
We sealed off the room,

03:29.640 --> 03:30.402
but this one...

03:30.440 --> 03:32.271
it's gonna be
a political nightmare.

03:32.310 --> 03:34.437
Why?
It's the reporter...

03:34.480 --> 03:36.573
Annabel Parker.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.648
Hey.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.715
_Looks like an
accrdental overdose,

03:44.750 --> 03:45.910
I'm sorry to say.

03:45.950 --> 03:48.680
Pretty wild party,
though.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.329
WEBSTER:
You know that drug overdoses
are the number one cause

03:54.360 --> 03:56.828
of accidental death
in New York?

03:56.870 --> 03:58.758
And heroin accounts
for 50%?

04:01.900 --> 04:04.437
(reporter speaks indistinctly,
distantly)

04:06.070 --> 04:08.004
Wait a second.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.701
She was left-handed.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.575
The needle mark
is in her left arm.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.678
People use their

04:13.720 --> 04:15.676
dominant hand to inject...

04:15.720 --> 04:16.687
right?

04:18.550 --> 04:20.381
This wasn't
an aCCIdental overdose.

04:20.420 --> 04:21.717
This was a murder.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.437
One more bull's-eye, I would've
had you. Plus, you footfaulted.

04:38.470 --> 04:39.437
Dreaming.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.732
Bad news. General Claridge's
office just kicked

04:41.780 --> 04:43.600
our interview request back.

04:43.650 --> 04:44.844
He's not available.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.745
On what grounds?
He's "engaged

04:46.780 --> 04:48.748
in matters of
national security."
Ah.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.441
With a naked intern?
You tell them

04:50.490 --> 04:51.684
if it's a subpoena they want,

04:51.720 --> 04:53.585
it's a subpoena they'll get.
Yep.

04:53.620 --> 04:54.985
You have a friend
in that office, right?

04:55.020 --> 04:57.580
Why don't you just ask him?

04:57.630 --> 04:59.791
Yeah. Maybe.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.695
What is that look on your face?

05:02.730 --> 05:04.766
No, no, no. It's just funny
you assume it's a man.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.631
Lieutenant Colonel
EmIIy Connors.

05:06.670 --> 05:08.638
Emily. Wow.

05:08.670 --> 05:10.809
Well, should I assume
by the look on your face

05:10.840 --> 05:13.479
that you two were more
than just friends?

05:13.510 --> 05:15.603
Carrie.
Mm?

05:15.640 --> 05:16.800
You slept with her, didn't you?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.738
That_ is a matter
of national security.

05:18.780 --> 05:20.111
You're not gonna tell me?

05:23.690 --> 05:26.045
Not jealous!

05:30.890 --> 05:32.858
So your assumption was correct.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.959
It was a hot shot,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.389
a massiye_amount
of herom Injected

05:37.430 --> 05:39.694
for the sole purpose
of killing someone.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.628
She also has bruises
on her wrists and her arms

05:41.670 --> 05:43.661
not from an injection.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.735
So they held her down
and shot her up.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.135
The reason criminals
use hot shots is that

05:47.180 --> 05:48.909
it's virtually impossible
to prove that the victim

05:48.940 --> 05:50.646
didn't inject themselves.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.875
So your left-handed theory
might help.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.741
Jo, I think she either knew
the killer and let them in,

05:55.780 --> 05:57.384
or the person was waiting
for her

05:57.420 --> 05:58.717
when she got back to the room.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.559
There's no sign of forced entry.

06:00.590 --> 06:02.478
So who had a key?
There was one key,

06:02.530 --> 06:04.748
according to the hotel,
and it was Annabel's.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.496
Did she lose it?

06:06.530 --> 06:08.122
You know, those little cards
can be confusing.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.765
The last one I had,
I tried to buy coffee with it,

06:10.800 --> 06:12.392
and the barista thought
I was hitting on him,

06:12.440 --> 06:13.759
which was kind of flattering

06:13.800 --> 06:15.791
but hey.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.808
JAY: The victim was found
by housekeeping

06:17.840 --> 06:21.037
when they came around to clean.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.638
Wait a second. You're a genius.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.739
I'm calling housekeeping.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.476
Fresh towels?

06:27.520 --> 06:29.784
AL:
Yeah, okay.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.789
Jay interviewed the housekeeper
at the hotel.

06:32.820 --> 06:35.482
She confirmed
she misplaced her key

06:35.520 --> 06:36.782
and it never turned up.
So the stolen

06:36.830 --> 06:40.049
master key gets our killer
into that room.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.489
But Annabel doesn't scream.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.088
She wasn't afraid.

06:44.130 --> 06:45.666
She knew her killer.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.608
This is some kind of notebook.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.835
Seems to be written in code.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.704
Hmm.

06:55.740 --> 06:57.844
We should get this to Jay.
Yeah.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.541
Hey, Al.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.445
How much
do you want to bet

07:01.480 --> 07:03.914
she was pissed
at somebody?

07:09.960 --> 07:12.121
Look at these.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.128
Flowers. Not opened.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.128
Dumped in the trash.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.628
And there is a card.

07:21.570 --> 07:23.765
"I'll make it up to you.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.698
"I promise.

07:25.740 --> 07:27.708
DG."

07:27.740 --> 07:30.641
Head of the network,
Donovan Gates?

07:30.680 --> 07:31.874
We should go
talk to him.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.673
I'm gonna drop in
on my Lieutenant Colonel.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.813
What?

07:35.850 --> 07:36.885
"Drop in"?
Yeah,

07:36.920 --> 07:40.117
just... police business.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.754
GATES:
Annabel was the face
of this network,

07:42.790 --> 07:44.519
but more than that,

07:44.560 --> 07:46.084
she was like my daughter.

07:46.130 --> 07:48.098
Everyone felt that way
about her.

07:48.130 --> 07:49.927
She was family.
Were you seeing

07:49.970 --> 07:52.120
Annabel outside work?

07:52.170 --> 07:53.797
Where'd you get an idea
like that?

07:53.840 --> 07:55.068
The flowers.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.260
A note that was

07:56.300 --> 07:58.234
a little more intimate
than "nice job."

07:58.270 --> 08:01.000
I'm on my third marriage.
I've got seven kids.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.746
I'm too exhausted
to fool around

08:02.780 --> 08:04.543
with a 29-year-old haircut.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.002
"Haircut"?

08:06.050 --> 08:07.972
It's what I call
all my on-aIr people.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.988
Look, I'm heartbroken
over the fact

08:10.020 --> 08:11.749
that she's dead.

08:11.790 --> 08:13.758
As for the note,

08:13.790 --> 08:16.850
when two powerful, committed,
creative people

08:16.890 --> 08:18.528
work together,

08:18.560 --> 08:19.857
feelings get hurt.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.197
I'm sure
you understand.

08:21.230 --> 08:22.891
Well, it has been

08:22.930 --> 08:25.296
a pleasure meeting
the best-looking detective

08:25.330 --> 08:26.729
in the department,

08:26.770 --> 08:28.533
but I think
that your time

08:28.570 --> 08:30.868
would be better spent with
Annabel's direct supervisor,

08:30.910 --> 08:32.707
Pemberton Ward.

08:32.740 --> 08:34.571
Thank you.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.543
MAN:
Annabel Parker's office.
This is Matt.

08:41.580 --> 08:42.945
Sorry, can you hold, please?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.719
Annabel Parker's office.
This is Matt.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.854
Please call
the WHN public affairs office.

08:46.890 --> 08:48.778
Sorry. Thanks.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.084
Annabel Parker's office.
This is Matt.
Hey, Matt.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.690
Can you open
Annabel's office for me?
Sorry, one sec.

08:53.730 --> 08:56.096
Please call...
NYPD.

08:56.130 --> 08:58.189
Open the office, Matt.

08:58.230 --> 09:00.630
Whoa. Uh, sorry.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.809
Busy day, huh?
Yeah.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.808
People don't really
know what to do.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.808
Especially me.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.831
I've never worked for
anybody who died before.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.643
How come you're here?

09:10.680 --> 09:11.806
How long had
you worked for her?

09:11.850 --> 09:13.010
Over a year.

09:13.050 --> 09:14.642
She was awesome.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.011
I still
can't believe it.

09:16.050 --> 09:18.018
Anything strange
happen recently?

09:18.050 --> 09:19.859
Did she act
differently?

09:19.890 --> 09:23.018
Like on drugs
or something?
Just anything odd. Hey.

09:23.060 --> 09:24.357
No, not at all.

09:24.390 --> 09:26.255
Detective Wells,
Pemberton Ward.

09:26.290 --> 09:27.951
I've got a show
that's about to tape.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.797
Can we walk and talk?
Sure.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.094
I started here as an intern
and have seen a lot of people

09:32.130 --> 09:35.634
come and go, but once Annabel
was on board, things got better.

09:35.670 --> 09:37.968
Everybody here
is devastated.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.376
She m_ust've made
a few enemies along the way.

09:40.410 --> 09:44.039
Comes _with the
territory.
Right.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.379
Are you guys investigating
her overdose?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.888
Wasn't it an accident?
MAN:
Here we go. 90 seconds to air.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.117
Did you notice anything
in the bar that night?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.855
Not really.

09:54.890 --> 09:56.983
We were just having fun.
There were some guys there

09:57.030 --> 09:58.827
that she blazed on some stories,

09:58.860 --> 10:02.023
but everybody respected Annabel
as a journalist.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.223
We're competitive,
yeah, but, in the end,

10:05.270 --> 10:08.364
we're family.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.833
Sorry about that.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.906
So tell me about the hotel.

10:11.940 --> 10:14.374
We kept it on hold for Annabel
to interview informants

10:14.410 --> 10:17.379
who needed discretion.
But it's...

10:17.410 --> 10:20.311
not like we had anything
scheduled for that night.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.716
It's possible she was working
up a new piece, but, uh,

10:22.750 --> 10:24.183
I wasn't aware of it.

10:24.220 --> 10:25.312
Are you sure?
Yeah.

10:25.350 --> 10:28.148
We were celebrating.

10:28.190 --> 10:30.055
She got a text, got up

10:30.090 --> 10:32.320
and that was the
last I saw of her.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.999
I don't know, maybe if I'd...

10:35.030 --> 10:38.420
gone with her,
or checked on her.

10:38.470 --> 10:41.030
But, um...

10:41.070 --> 10:43.209
How could you know?

10:43.240 --> 10:46.004
Yeah.
. MAN; .
Gomg live In five.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.044
So Major Crimes
has worked out for you.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.742
Oh, I love it.
Something new every day.

10:52.780 --> 10:56.170
And you've partnered
with your ex.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.915
Maybe... not "ex."

10:57.950 --> 10:59.986
Oh, still ex.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.419
Keeping tabs on me?

11:01.460 --> 11:05.248
Us Washington folk
occasionally scan the Times.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.996
You two make a lot of news.

11:07.030 --> 11:08.725
That we do.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.694
So maybe we should get around

11:10.730 --> 11:11.992
to why you called me.

11:12.030 --> 11:13.998
I called you 'cause
I want to see you.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.836
Al, I'm in
the intelligence business.

11:17.870 --> 11:19.337
All right.

11:19.370 --> 11:21.804
I want to talk to your
boss, General Claridge.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.102
And you know why.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.970
It's not gonna happen.
The young woman

11:25.010 --> 11:27.342
who destroyed
his career was killed.

11:27.380 --> 11:30.144
It's pretty standard to talk
to anyone who might have motive.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.441
Well, he's not cooperating
with anything

11:31.490 --> 11:32.980
connected to the scandal.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.885
I am not interested
in the scandal.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.184
I'm interested in the murder.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.027
I can force him.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.755
You can try.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.721
Listen, he is a good man

11:44.770 --> 11:46.863
who's been framed
for something that he didn't do.

11:46.900 --> 11:50.301
He's not even in the photo
with the intern.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.308
Everything is circumstantial.

11:52.340 --> 11:55.776
What about the romantic e-mails
between him and the intern?

11:58.550 --> 12:02.179
General Claridge has
been around for a long time.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.857
There are a lot of people
with very serious skills

12:06.890 --> 12:08.858
who would like
to see him ruined.

12:08.890 --> 12:11.859
You're a good cop, Al.

12:11.890 --> 12:13.118
Don't you think
it's interesting that nobody

12:13.160 --> 12:15.299
can find the intern, Hoda Amin?

12:15.330 --> 12:18.128
You're telling me the NSA
doesn't even know where she is?

12:18.170 --> 12:20.195
I'm saying it's gonna get dirty.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.390
And I want you
to tread lightly here.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.431
Please.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.471
Hey, listen.

12:30.510 --> 12:33.013
I want you to reach out to
every contact you have--

12:33.050 --> 12:35.143
FBI, Marshals,
whatever.

12:35.180 --> 12:36.442
I want to find
Hoda Amin.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.880
The intern from
the Claridge scandal?

12:38.920 --> 12:40.808
I want to talk to anyone
close to Claridge.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.124
She's a good place to start.
Hmm.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.128
What have you got?

12:45.160 --> 12:47.321
Well, since we weren't able
to find Annabel's phone,

12:47.360 --> 12:49.123
I dumped it for all
the call records and texts,

12:49.160 --> 12:51.025
but there's nothing there.
Nothing about the room

12:51.070 --> 12:52.423
and anything related.

12:52.470 --> 12:54.233
My guess is she used Snapchat

12:54.270 --> 12:56.135
or Burn Note
for these kinds of messages.

12:56.170 --> 12:57.239
No idea what you're
talking about.

12:57.270 --> 12:59.932
They're apps where messages
appear for a short time,

12:59.980 --> 13:01.402
then they disappear.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.442
So, perfect for spies.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.141
Or discreet hookups.

13:05.180 --> 13:07.239
I'm downloading it right now.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.884
So I was just sifting through
tons of videos from the hotel

13:11.920 --> 13:13.808
elevator and lobby.
There's Annabel

13:13.860 --> 13:16.249
in the elevator.
Time-stamped 10:25.

13:16.290 --> 13:19.088
Wait a second, why aren't there
any images of the 14th floor?

13:19.130 --> 13:21.348
That'd be the VIP floor.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.095
Discretion's what they're
selling there.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.893
Lot of plastic surgery
recoveries,

13:24.930 --> 13:27.239
clandestine meetings,
that sort of kind of thing.

13:27.270 --> 13:29.295
Wait a second,
stop it, right there.

13:32.340 --> 13:35.571
Yeah, okay. Jay interviewed
the housekeeper at the hotel.

13:35.610 --> 13:37.840
There was a framed picture
of that guy in

13:37.880 --> 13:38.972
Annabel's
apartment.

13:39.010 --> 13:41.149
And look at the timecode.

13:41.180 --> 13:44.286
AL: Ten minutes after
Annabel left the elevator.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.982
When does he get back on?
Well...

13:49.290 --> 13:52.123
He doesn't.
Aha.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.559
All right, let's ID him.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.125
All right.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.867
MURRAY:
So how long were
you two together?

13:58.900 --> 14:00.538
She ended it after the...

14:00.570 --> 14:02.902
greatest six months of my life.

14:02.940 --> 14:05.067
She was ambitious, but

14:05.110 --> 14:06.134
people didn't
know her like...

14:06.170 --> 14:08.206
like I knew her.

14:08.240 --> 14:12.176
She was kind and
she was sweet.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.917
Gentle soul in every way.

14:14.950 --> 14:17.043
Did you follow her to the hotel?

14:18.350 --> 14:20.352
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

14:22.390 --> 14:24.221
I needed to tell her how I felt.

14:24.260 --> 14:26.478
So you go up to
the 14th floor...
And I knocked

14:26.530 --> 14:28.157
and I knocked, but...

14:28.200 --> 14:30.225
but sh-she wouldn't
open the door to talk to me.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.919
She told me to leave.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.232
How'd you know about that room?

14:33.270 --> 14:34.669
I was her cameraman

14:34.700 --> 14:36.588
at WHN before I quit.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.165
You never get back
on the elevator.

14:39.210 --> 14:40.905
Where'd you go?

14:42.310 --> 14:45.199
There's a secret set
of stairs to...

14:45.250 --> 14:48.071
sneak out celebrities.
We used them all the time.

14:52.590 --> 14:55.115
Carrie Wells.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.458
Detective Wells?
This is Hoda Amin.

14:57.490 --> 14:59.481
You need to stop looking for me.

14:59.530 --> 15:01.191
Where are you?

15:01.230 --> 15:03.289
I'm no longer in the country.
Please.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.423
By pursuing me, you're
putting my life in danger.

15:05.470 --> 15:06.425
I'm begging you.
Ho...

15:06.470 --> 15:08.529
Hello?

15:08.570 --> 15:10.663
Hello?

15:15.480 --> 15:17.402
Jay said Hoda's cell was a
burner. No way to be certain

15:17.450 --> 15:19.509
it was really her.
It was her. I know it was her.

15:19.550 --> 15:21.177
And she's trying to tell us
something important.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.619
Someone wants us to stop.

15:22.650 --> 15:24.083
It's the someone
that bothers me.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.280
These Washington guys...

15:26.650 --> 15:28.186
Ah, I rest

15:28.220 --> 15:30.620
my case.
Hello.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.958
Is the president here to see me?
I'm awfully flattered.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.491
Not the president,
but the next best thing.

15:35.530 --> 15:37.589
Francis, get out
of my chair.
Hey.

15:37.630 --> 15:41.066
Needed to check my e-mails.
Thank you.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.658
What are you
doing here?

15:42.700 --> 15:44.463
We need to talk.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.466
In private.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.479
I like private.

15:49.510 --> 15:52.968
How'd you get the password
to unlock my computer?

15:54.380 --> 15:56.371
Oh, thank you.

15:57.650 --> 15:59.686
So?

15:59.720 --> 16:01.517
General Claridge.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.381
It's the top item at
our morning briefings,

16:04.430 --> 16:06.022
and your name was mentioned.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.199
Did it make you
feel warm all over?

16:09.700 --> 16:11.361
Claridge is a
tough customer.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.391
And I thought you should know.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.738
Are you telling me to back off?

16:18.470 --> 16:20.028
It's just a heads-up.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.274
CARRIE:
You could have called.

16:21.310 --> 16:22.709
It seemed impersonal.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.708
You're all about
the personal touch.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.173
Well, you should know
that about me by now.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.676
Uh-huh.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.608
So...

16:30.650 --> 16:33.653
I didn't put on hand-crafted
French perfume

16:33.690 --> 16:35.749
so we could talk shop,
did I?

16:35.790 --> 16:38.122
I'm sorry.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.049
I just thought you could give me
some insight into why Hoda Amin

16:41.100 --> 16:42.624
would think her life
was in danger.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.629
Don't get distracted
by the messenger.

16:46.670 --> 16:48.592
Pay attention to the message.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.437
So, you don't think
she's in danger?

16:50.470 --> 16:53.701
Sure she is, just not
in the way that you think.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.300
But you've got
a different problem.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.808
Which is?

16:58.850 --> 17:00.818
You're wasting a lovely meal

17:00.850 --> 17:03.580
with a beautiful woman.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.588
Mm.

17:10.390 --> 17:11.459
What's this?

17:11.490 --> 17:14.129
Subpoena for your boss.

17:16.730 --> 17:18.698
You're supposed to give it
to the person directly.

17:18.730 --> 17:21.665
That's absolutely correct.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.100
Maybe you could
help me with that.

17:26.340 --> 17:28.570
No wonder you're still single.

17:28.610 --> 17:30.771
Hmm.

17:30.810 --> 17:33.313
How was your lunch?

17:33.350 --> 17:34.669
Good. Yours?
Good.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.608
We both had good lunches.
Mine was great.

17:36.650 --> 17:38.311
Mine was just good.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.750
Good is fine when
you can't have great.

17:40.790 --> 17:43.657
So our killer
came out this door

17:43.690 --> 17:47.126
and disappeared
into the darkness.

17:48.530 --> 17:49.622
Hey.

17:49.660 --> 17:52.561
Yo. What's up?

17:52.600 --> 17:56.536
Were you here last night
when Annabel Parker died?

17:56.570 --> 17:58.629
I'm working every night,
unless you're making an offer.

17:58.670 --> 18:01.468
You see anything odd?
W-What are you guys,
like, cops, or something?

18:01.510 --> 18:02.738
All of these guys
were here last night,

18:02.780 --> 18:04.600
and the same guys
here this morning?

18:04.650 --> 18:07.278
Look, nobody's leaving
a front page story like this.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.752
One of them's missing.
Guy with a weird hat?

18:19.790 --> 18:22.452
Oh, Yeah. Joey was here.
Joey Quinones.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.297
He was tight with Annabel
'cause he used to run

18:24.330 --> 18:26.662
special... errands for her
every now and then.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.759
What kind of special errands?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.802
You're gonna
have to ask Joey about that, but

18:30.840 --> 18:33.604
let's just say photography
wasn't his only job.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.369
Where can we find him?

18:39.550 --> 18:41.541
There he is.

18:46.190 --> 18:47.680
AL:
Joey Qumones?

18:47.720 --> 18:49.813
Yeah?
Yo got a minute?

18:49.860 --> 18:51.487
Sure.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.392
Oh. I guess
you don't make

19:00.440 --> 19:02.829
enough money selling sleazy
pictures to Web sites.

19:02.870 --> 19:05.361
The heroin packets match the
ones we found in Annabel's room.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.866
You're done, Joey.

19:06.910 --> 19:08.605
I'm not a murderer.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.777
You're a heroin dealer.

19:09.810 --> 19:11.402
Annabel died from a hot shot.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.714
And now, your palm print
in her hotel room.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.878
Yeah, okay, so I was in there
last night, but early.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.740
Oh, okay.
I had the drugs,

19:18.790 --> 19:20.212
the door was propped open.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.558
I put 'em in the safe
and then I was gone.

19:22.590 --> 19:23.921
There was nobody there.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.757
You ever deliver drugs
to her before?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.599
No.

19:27.630 --> 19:29.393
I thought it was
weird, but I figured

19:29.430 --> 19:31.318
she was working on
an undercover thing,

19:31.370 --> 19:33.429
making a trade for a
story or something.

19:33.470 --> 19:35.836
You heard from Annabel directly?
She called you?

19:35.870 --> 19:38.668
No. It was a Burn Note.

19:38.710 --> 19:41.804
But she had nicknames for
everybody. Mine was Holden.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.240
You know, like
Catcher in the Rye.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.646
She's the only one who called me
that, so I knew it was her.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.272
Burn Note

19:48.320 --> 19:49.742
Snapchat

19:49.780 --> 19:51.611
How'd you get into the safe?

19:51.650 --> 19:54.653
She gave me the code
in the note.

19:54.690 --> 19:56.658
9461.

19:56.690 --> 19:57.884
Easy to remember.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.784
What is that?

19:59.830 --> 20:02.298
WHN1

20:02.330 --> 20:05.424
Exactly. But listen, listen,

20:05.470 --> 20:07.438
I didn't kill anybody.

20:07.470 --> 20:09.859
It doesn't look good
for you, Joey.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.460
You're gonna have to come up
with something else.

20:12.510 --> 20:14.933
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:14.980 --> 20:15.901
I got it.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.908
I've got over 500 pictures

20:17.950 --> 20:20.339
of ballplayers stepping out
on their wives--

20:20.380 --> 20:23.486
they won't get me killed.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.909
I think this one could.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.952
Check my camera from that night.

20:31.890 --> 20:33.790
JAY:
I don't know, Al.

20:33.830 --> 20:37.368
I think he's stalling.
No, I don't think so.
Keep going.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.698
All right.
Right there, right there.

20:39.730 --> 20:41.869
That's General Claridge
leaving the hotel.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.629
Right? Look at the time stamp.

20:43.670 --> 20:46.503
That's a half an hour
after Annabel

20:46.540 --> 20:48.007
got off the elevator.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.873
Revenge is a dish
best served cold.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.414
The general's lawyers claim
he's not even in the country.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.348
Stop Can you stop

21:02.390 --> 21:04.858
harassing the Deputy Director
of Nation Security?

21:04.890 --> 21:09.498
This guy is a suspect
in a murder investigation.

21:09.530 --> 21:11.725
The name at the
top of our list.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.465
Why isn't Joey Quinones
that name?

21:13.500 --> 21:15.036
This was way over
his pay grade.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.537
Okay, let me
break it down.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.504
On one side, we have a sleazy,

21:18.540 --> 21:21.839
drug-dealing paparazzo
who was actually in the room

21:21.880 --> 21:23.472
and knows how to inject heroin.

21:23.510 --> 21:25.546
And on the other side,
we have

21:25.580 --> 21:27.673
a highly-decorated
intelligence officer

21:27.720 --> 21:30.689
whom no one saw at the hotel
that night.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.314
Didn't your mommy tell you not
to judge a book by its cover?

21:33.360 --> 21:35.089
We have a photograph.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.623
Forget about that.
Can't this just be easy?

21:37.660 --> 21:40.356
Remember the good old days
when it was just

21:40.400 --> 21:41.651
the drug dealer who did it?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.099
Are you still
having dinner

21:43.130 --> 21:44.461
with Frankie later?

21:44.500 --> 21:45.865
Yeah. Why?
You and, uh, Emily

21:45.900 --> 21:47.765
want to do
a double date thing tonight?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.392
I'm just saying,
if the subject

21:49.440 --> 21:51.328
of how to get to the
general comes up...

21:51.370 --> 21:52.928
I should seduce

21:52.970 --> 21:55.803
the information out of him,
do whatever it takes, right?

21:55.840 --> 21:57.705
Or you could just
ask for his help?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.706
Or I could seduce him.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.548
Hmm.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.445
No one is untouchable.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.082
Are you kidding me?

22:06.120 --> 22:08.759
See, that's why guys
like Claridge get into the game.

22:08.790 --> 22:10.428
See, they're allowed
to do things

22:10.460 --> 22:11.620
that the rest of us aren't.

22:11.660 --> 22:14.094
You need to stay away from him.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.690
Stay away from him?
Stay away.

22:16.730 --> 22:18.561
Do you know me at all?

22:18.600 --> 22:20.739
That's exactly what
I'm trying to do here.

22:20.770 --> 22:22.738
Listen, I can protect myself.

22:22.770 --> 22:26.103
Okay? I just need you to get
me in a room with Claridge.

22:26.140 --> 22:28.108
I don't want to get you
in a room with Claridge.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.108
I'm trying to get you
in a rooghwith me.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.870
No.
No, that's not gonna work.

22:32.910 --> 22:35.117
No
You're trying to distract me.

22:35.150 --> 22:37.710
You're trying to distract
me, and it's working.

22:37.750 --> 22:40.457
...so sew.

22:44.590 --> 22:46.581
Good morning.
Hey, Carrie.

22:46.630 --> 22:48.621
Oh, you know,
you got, like, this, uh,

22:48.660 --> 22:49.922
nice glow about you
this morning.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.496
Oh, yeah? Thanks.

22:51.530 --> 22:52.360
Late night, was it?

22:52.400 --> 22:55.130
I hope Francis was
at least helpful.

22:55.170 --> 22:57.900
Oh, define... "helpful."
Oh, I think I'd rather not.

22:57.940 --> 23:00.500
Jay, what have you got?
Yeah, Jay, what have you got?

23:00.540 --> 23:02.679
Right, uh, so,
this is Annabel's laptop, and

23:02.710 --> 23:05.406
I've been sifting through her
e-mails looking for something

23:05.450 --> 23:07.714
relevant, and she's got
over 600 messages in her inbox.

23:07.750 --> 23:10.412
But while I was working, about
40 of them suddenly disappeared

23:10.450 --> 23:14.716
from the screen, all of them
from a sender named Zombie19.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.921
Annabel Parker's office.
This is Matt.

23:22.960 --> 23:27.169
Please call the WHN
public affairs office. Thanks.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.465
Zombie... 19. That's...

23:30.510 --> 23:31.932
Annabel's assistant, Matt.

23:31.970 --> 23:35.428
The missing e-mails
came from him.
Let's go.

23:36.810 --> 23:39.074
He must have_
cleared out overnight.

23:39.110 --> 23:41.214
It was like this _
when we got here this mornIng.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.514
Any idea where he might
have gone

23:43.550 --> 23:44.881
I barely knew him.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.842
He was kind of a
geelq computer guy.

23:46.890 --> 23:50.155
I'll go see if HR has
any other info on him.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.133
This is Matt.
Hey, Matt.

24:03.170 --> 24:04.535
I need you to open
Annabel's office for me.

24:04.570 --> 24:06.003
Sorry. One sec.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.202
Busy around here, huh?
Yeah.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.798
People don't really
know what to do.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.841
Wait a second.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.576
Hang on.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.247
JAY: _
Hey, CarrIe.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.611
Hey, Jay, listen.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.549
Matt had a laptop computer.
It's missing now.

24:23.590 --> 24:25.979
It had a white sticker
on it with a symbol--

24:26.030 --> 24:28.999
a black circle with a
lightning bolt on either side.

24:29.030 --> 24:31.828
Can you cross-reference
that symbol with hacking?

24:31.870 --> 24:34.191
Are you sure
it's a lightning bolt, Carrie?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.992
'Cause, uh, I got nothing.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.507
Hang on.

24:37.540 --> 24:42.603
I am gonna send you...
a little gift.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.643
All right, can you
take a picture of that?

24:45.680 --> 24:47.875
Got it?
Mm-hmm.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.541
Oh.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.218
I got it.

24:56.260 --> 24:59.149
It's from a hacker co-op
called Hacktropolis.

24:59.190 --> 25:00.919
Apparently,
these geeks rent workspace

25:00.960 --> 25:03.121
for 50 bucks a week.
I'll send you the address.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.661
I'll meet you there.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.136
Hello?

25:20.980 --> 25:23.119
I don't know.
Shouldn't this place be crawling

25:23.150 --> 25:25.584
in guys with glasses
and neckbeards?

25:25.620 --> 25:28.088
Maybe there's a Star
Wars convention in town.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.156
I got a bad feeling
about this, Al.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.150
Wait. Look.

26:01.020 --> 26:03.284
Now another
person IS dead.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.856
What does this have
to do with me?

26:04.890 --> 26:06.653
I'm not making
accusations.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.692
I'm asking for your help.

26:08.730 --> 26:11.665
This has all the tradecraft
of your side of the table.

26:13.370 --> 26:15.930
You have no idea what
my side of the table is like.

26:15.970 --> 26:17.767
Look, no disrespect.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.131
I got two young
people murdered.

26:20.170 --> 26:21.876
You don't understand
how hard it was

26:21.910 --> 26:23.639
for me to get
where I am now.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.369
What you're asking me for--

26:26.410 --> 26:28.617
if I hand it over to you,
everyone will know.

26:28.650 --> 26:31.881
The NSA, the CIA, Homeland.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.683
I'll be through.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.381
It's a breach
I won't recover from.

26:35.420 --> 26:36.956
My career will be over.

26:36.990 --> 26:39.959
I understand. I do.

26:39.990 --> 26:43.027
But the Emily Connors
I used to know--

26:43.060 --> 26:46.063
she knew the difference
between right and wrong.

26:52.010 --> 26:56.174
Do you know why I wanted to meet
you here by the library today?

26:56.210 --> 26:58.804
Besides the memory
of our first kiss?

26:58.850 --> 27:00.272
No.

27:00.310 --> 27:03.814
There's a wonderful manuscript

27:03.850 --> 27:06.683
by Blaise de Vigenre.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.779
It's worth reading.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.318
So, obviously, there are
no surveillance cameras

27:18.370 --> 27:19.997
in a hacker's co-op.

27:20.030 --> 27:21.429
Plus, his computer's
missing, so,

27:21.470 --> 27:24.132
we have nothing but
dead ends on Matt.

27:24.170 --> 27:26.968
Whoa! That is a big book.

27:27.010 --> 27:28.329
You know, you told me
you weren't into

27:28.380 --> 27:29.802
the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.673
Try Blaise De Vigenre,
the 1586 edition.

27:32.710 --> 27:36.077
It's a copy from the library
bookstore, but it will do.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.917
The Vigenre cipher?

27:37.950 --> 27:39.986
My guess is, it's what
Annabel used in her notebook.

27:40.020 --> 27:41.681
All the major
intelligence agencies

27:41.720 --> 27:44.928
have been using a version of
this code since World War II.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.326
I tried it already, Al.
The research librarian

27:47.360 --> 27:48.759
told me Vigenre
made a change

27:48.800 --> 27:50.290
from the first edition
to the second.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.423
This is the
second edition.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.961
That's why you need
the key in this book.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.730
You know, the A! Burns

27:57.770 --> 27:59.761
I know is kind of
a comic book guy.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.232
Who turned you on to Vigenre?

28:01.280 --> 28:03.407
I did it by myself.
Lie!

28:03.440 --> 28:05.271
All right. Had a little help.

28:05.310 --> 28:07.198
Ah. From Lieutenant Colonel
Emily Connors?

28:07.250 --> 28:09.468
As a matter of fact, yes.

28:09.520 --> 28:12.216
Hmm.
At least my
contact was useful.

28:12.250 --> 28:14.286
Well, that depends on how
you define "useful."

28:14.320 --> 28:16.379
JAY:
Hey, guys, I don't
mean to interrupt, but

28:16.420 --> 28:18.820
when I run Annabel's notebook
through the decryption sobeare,

28:18.860 --> 28:21.795
I get all kinds of contact info:
names, phone numbers.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.388
Yeah, she had a
thing for nicknames.

28:23.430 --> 28:25.227
Holden, Casper, Zombie19.

28:25.270 --> 28:28.262
Casper! As in
"Casper the Friendly Ghost."

28:28.300 --> 28:31.201
Ghost is also known as "spook."

28:31.240 --> 28:33.208
It's her spy contact.
Yes!

28:33.240 --> 28:35.299
And it's also the keyword
that breaks the code.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.932
Okay, what's the info
on that name?

28:36.980 --> 28:38.777
Uh... it's just a phone number.

28:38.810 --> 28:41.472
Bring up Annabel's cell records
to that number.

28:42.880 --> 28:46.782
Just text messages
between the two of them.

28:46.820 --> 28:49.459
All sent
using the Vigenre cipher.

28:49.490 --> 28:51.822
I know what you're thinking,
but we got to be careful here.
But if

28:51.860 --> 28:54.328
anyone knows anything, it's
gonna be this Casper person.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.851
But a call from you could
scare off our best lead.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.390
Fine. I will text.

28:58.430 --> 28:59.863
Jay, type in

28:59.900 --> 29:01.492
"I want to talk" using Vigenre.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.189
All right. All right.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.179
Okay.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.040
Here we go.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.410
It's not like he's gonna...

29:19.550 --> 29:20.812
What?

29:20.860 --> 29:22.782
Are you serious?

29:22.820 --> 29:24.924
S_omeone's hacked
Into our system.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.552
"East River Generating Station.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.251
"Building Two
will be unlocked.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.052
"2100 hours.

29:30.100 --> 29:33.934
I look forward to meeting you,
Detective Wells."

29:38.440 --> 29:42.228
WOMAN:
I see you had no
trouble finding us.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.539
Thank you for coming
to meet me.

29:46.580 --> 29:49.913
Happy to help,
but let's be clear.

29:49.950 --> 29:51.508
If I get nervous,
I'll be gone.

29:51.550 --> 29:54.553
And you won't leave
this tunnel alive.

30:09.370 --> 30:11.429
Did you kill Annabel Parker?

30:11.470 --> 30:13.267
WOMAN:
I can confirm that it wasn't us.

30:13.310 --> 30:15.369
Can you confirm who it was?

30:15.410 --> 30:16.536
Not really interested.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.400
We don't solve
crImes, you see.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.442
That's what you do, and quite
well from what I understand.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.983
We try and stop trouble
before it starts

30:24.020 --> 30:27.911
by gathering information and
engaging those who can help.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.110
People like Annabel.
Indeed.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.082
Her reputation
as a serious journalist

30:32.130 --> 30:34.997
hungry for her big break
made her the perfect choice.

30:35.030 --> 30:37.248
Hoda Amin was one of yours,
too, wasn't she?

30:37.300 --> 30:38.619
She's in no danger,

30:38.670 --> 30:40.467
but doesn't want
her cover blown.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.491
The call she made
to you was a warning

30:42.540 --> 30:44.303
that you chose
to ignore.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.001
I'm here to solve two murders.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.302
I would

30:47.340 --> 30:48.932
encourage you to do that,

30:48.980 --> 30:51.278
and not draw
any more attention to us.

30:51.310 --> 30:52.868
All we wanted was

30:52.910 --> 30:55.071
to block Claridge's appointment
to the CIA.

30:55.120 --> 30:59.181
A simple mission, but sometimes
these things go sideways.

30:59.220 --> 31:01.108
Annabel was to put
the photo on the air

31:01.160 --> 31:02.559
and then get
out of the way.

31:02.590 --> 31:05.252
But, apparently,
that wasn't enough for her,

31:05.290 --> 31:07.224
so I assume
she got her a55istant,

31:07.260 --> 31:08.898
the so-called computer expert,

31:08.930 --> 31:11.467
to place those e-mails
on Claridge's computer.

31:11.500 --> 31:15.368
_ So... a little
interagency warfare?

31:15.400 --> 31:17.960
It was ambition that got both
of these assets killed,

31:18.010 --> 31:19.409
not the intelligence community.

31:19.440 --> 31:22.204
These were human beings,
not assets.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.970
Ambition. Focus on that.

31:25.010 --> 31:27.399
Who, in the end,
benefits the most?

31:27.450 --> 31:29.418
Not the NSA.

31:29.450 --> 31:31.987
Not the CIA.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.386
I still have que...
AL: Wait!

31:34.420 --> 31:36.058
Carrie.

31:36.090 --> 31:37.682
Let her go.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.358
Look around you.

31:39.390 --> 31:42.120
We're outgunned.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.366
REPORTER:
But what about
declining revenue, Mr. Gates?

31:47.400 --> 31:50.369
The network was struggling with
viewership for a long time, yes.

31:50.400 --> 31:53.164
But now we've prevailed.

31:53.210 --> 31:54.370
Wait a second.

31:54.410 --> 31:57.379
WHN were in severe
finanCIal trouble.

31:57.410 --> 31:59.549
They needed something
to make people

31:59.580 --> 32:01.343
sit up and pay attention.

32:01.380 --> 32:03.348
And now they have it
in spades.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.382
Let's get out of here.

32:06.490 --> 32:08.185
GATES:
Thank you, fellow members...

32:08.220 --> 32:10.051
You're gonna want
to see this.

32:10.090 --> 32:12.558
It has come to my attention

32:12.590 --> 32:15.559
that one of our brightest stars,
Annabel Parker,

32:15.600 --> 32:18.569
was living a double life

32:18.600 --> 32:20.465
unknown to us.

32:20.500 --> 32:24.709
She was a wild, overly ambitious
reporter with a drug problem

32:24.740 --> 32:27.208
who would do anything
to manufacture a story,

32:27.240 --> 32:29.401
even where there wasn't one.

32:29.440 --> 32:33.206
And that was the case
with General Claridge.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.571
While we cannot vouch
for the photograph,

32:35.620 --> 32:38.418
we have found evidence
that leads us to believe

32:38.450 --> 32:41.112
that the e-mails attributed
to the general

32:41.160 --> 32:44.721
came directly
from Ms. Parker's assistant.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.421
They're painting a picture
of "Bad Annabel"

32:46.460 --> 32:49.122
in order to tie everything up
in a neat little bow.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.299
We just put this together.
How could they be ahead of us?

32:51.330 --> 32:54.458
And General Claridge
is a national hero

32:54.500 --> 32:59.506
for enduring this embarrassment
with such grace.

32:59.540 --> 33:03.135
I will make_it _
my personal mi55ion

33:03.180 --> 33:05.546
to assure the veracity
of these stories

33:05.580 --> 33:07.639
before broadcasting them.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.641
Two minutes,
maybe three,

33:12.690 --> 33:14.749
and then he's gone again.

33:14.790 --> 33:16.678
Thank you.

33:16.720 --> 33:20.326
Make it count.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.488
General! Lieutenant Burns,

33:28.540 --> 33:30.394
Major Crimes.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.237
Lieutenant.
How can I help?

33:32.270 --> 33:34.170
I need to know what happened

33:34.210 --> 33:36.337
in Annabel Parker's hotel room
that night.

33:38.380 --> 33:40.803
Ms. Parker's office
set the meeting.

33:40.850 --> 33:42.715
I went to set her straight.

33:42.750 --> 33:46.311
The photo was a fake.
The e-mails were fake.

33:46.350 --> 33:49.080
It was only a matter
of time before our people
broke it all down.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.485
Ms. Parker said
she was gonna come clean--

33:50.520 --> 33:53.159
she just needed another day.
I said fine.

33:53.190 --> 33:55.624
I had a flight to Qatar
to catch.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.628
How come you didn't
come forward earlier?

33:57.660 --> 33:59.264
I was in the middle
of something.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.562
In about a week,
you and the whole world

34:00.600 --> 34:02.431
are gonna hear about it.
But for now,

34:02.470 --> 34:04.438
at Emily's insistence,

34:04.470 --> 34:06.438
I'm giving you all I can.

34:06.470 --> 34:08.335
Now, listen,

34:08.380 --> 34:10.336
I'm sorry that young woman
was killed.

34:10.380 --> 34:13.577
She truly had a change of heart.

34:13.610 --> 34:16.113
Seemed like a nice person.
I told her boss

34:16.150 --> 34:17.640
that she was just someone
who got caught up in something

34:17.680 --> 34:19.443
that she didn't understand.

34:19.490 --> 34:21.185
Her boss?

34:21.220 --> 34:23.484
You talked to Donovan Gates
about this?

34:23.520 --> 34:24.555
No.

34:24.590 --> 34:26.251
No, the young man
had an odd name.

34:26.290 --> 34:29.623
Uh... Pendergrast?

34:29.660 --> 34:31.764
Pemberton Ward?

34:31.800 --> 34:34.291
That's it.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.308
AL:
Pemberton Ward

34:41.340 --> 34:43.308
knew the entire story
but didn't tell us.

34:43.340 --> 34:46.707
I'll take the office,
you take the control room.
Great.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.741
Where is Pemberton Ward?

34:48.780 --> 34:50.748
I'm sorry,
but we're about to go on.

34:50.780 --> 34:52.509
I need to
speak to him.

34:52.550 --> 34:54.586
He's on the floor.
Now.

34:54.620 --> 34:55.882
Pemberton?

34:55.920 --> 34:58.423
Your friend is here.

34:58.460 --> 34:59.859
My friend?

34:59.890 --> 35:01.699
The cop.

35:01.730 --> 35:02.890
Oh.

35:02.930 --> 35:06.263
Okay. Uh, I'll come right up.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.888
Are you guys
investigating her overdose?

35:09.940 --> 35:11.760
Wasn't it an accident?

35:13.410 --> 35:15.378
Yesterday you had live feed

35:15.410 --> 35:16.877
to the whole studio up here.
Mm-hmm.

35:16.910 --> 35:18.571
Can you bring up
those cameras?
Uh, sure.

35:18.610 --> 35:20.305
I need to see 'em.
Now. All of 'em.

35:23.680 --> 35:24.578
Where does that door lead?

35:24.620 --> 35:25.712
MAN:
To the roof.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.615
The roof.

36:27.710 --> 36:29.746
Pemberton! Hold it!

36:29.780 --> 36:30.849
Pemberton!

36:37.760 --> 36:38.727
All right.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.557
Get up.

36:43.430 --> 36:45.762
You're a little small
for a linebacker.

36:45.800 --> 36:49.236
Yeah, well, I make up for it
with speed. Right?

36:49.270 --> 36:50.794
Come on.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.569
Whew.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.771
Snapchat. Burn Note.

36:54.810 --> 36:57.301
That doesn't prove anything.
CARRIE:
You know what does?

36:57.340 --> 36:59.774
Your access to Matt,
your knowledge of
Annabel's work habits

36:59.810 --> 37:01.675
and the fact that you were
at the hotel that night.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.518
That doesn't prove I was in the
room. I want to call my lawyer.

37:04.550 --> 37:06.518
Great idea. Here.
Call your lavwer.

37:06.550 --> 37:07.881
Fine.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.517
One second.

37:11.490 --> 37:12.923
Bear with me for a minute, okay?

37:12.960 --> 37:15.451
Al, what was
the security code used

37:15.500 --> 37:17.695
on the safe in Annabel's room
that night?

37:17.730 --> 37:19.391
9461.
CARRIE:
9461,

37:19.430 --> 37:20.692
the very same number
you just punched

37:20.730 --> 37:22.493
into your keypad.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.337
And when I check
the outgoing message logs

37:27.840 --> 37:29.705
There it is.

37:29.740 --> 37:34.541
Messages to Joey Quinones
and Annabel Parker

37:34.580 --> 37:36.810
the night she was murdered.
I got you.

37:36.850 --> 37:38.886
Why

37:38.920 --> 37:41.809
She was gonna ruin Donovan

37:41.860 --> 37:43.680
and WHN.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.689
I couldn't let that happen.

37:46.730 --> 37:48.698
He's like a father to me,

37:48.730 --> 37:50.698
and this is my home,

37:50.730 --> 37:51.992
my family.

37:52.030 --> 37:53.895
Did Donovan have anything
to do with this?

37:53.930 --> 37:55.488
No.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.737
I thought I could clean this up
on my own.

37:58.770 --> 38:01.637
When Annabel had
a change of heart

38:01.680 --> 38:04.501
and said she wanted to recant
on the photo and the story,

38:04.550 --> 38:06.973
I got Matt to make up some
e-mails between Claridge

38:07.010 --> 38:10.446
and Hoda Amin. We had to protect
the story. If it fell apart,

38:10.480 --> 38:13.085
I knew it would destroy
our careers.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.418
She didn't care.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.610
WHN was just
a job for her.

38:18.660 --> 38:21.629
For me...

38:21.660 --> 38:24.823
it's my whole life.

38:24.870 --> 38:30.331
So too bad for Annabel that
she had a conscience, right?

38:36.980 --> 38:39.949
I'm glad you changed
your mind.

38:39.980 --> 38:43.472
You reminded me of
who I used to be.

38:43.520 --> 38:44.942
That was a gift.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.117
I'm a giver.
Everyone says so.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.948
Yes, they do.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.727
I'm remembering why we split up.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.091
These good-byes are tough.

38:56.130 --> 38:58.894
Yeah. But you know what?

38:58.930 --> 39:00.693
Times are changing.

39:00.730 --> 39:01.936
How?

39:01.970 --> 39:04.609
You'll see.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.858
I got to go.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.882
Emily.

39:21.490 --> 39:23.617
Train station's this way.

39:23.660 --> 39:24.957
I know.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.686
I just have a couple stops
to make beforehand.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.568
All right. Thank you.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.058
Well?
Well.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.449
You're a lot of
fun, you know,

39:44.480 --> 39:45.879
when you let your hair down.
Mmm.

39:47.980 --> 39:50.016
Be careful, okay?
You worried
about me?

39:50.050 --> 39:51.915
No. No.
Are you worried about me?

39:51.950 --> 39:53.110
I'm not worried about you.
I know you can take care

39:53.150 --> 39:54.959
of yourself.
POTUS worries about you.

39:54.990 --> 39:57.788
Yeah.

39:57.820 --> 40:00.482
You're something else,
Carrie Wells.

40:00.530 --> 40:01.929
You're not so bad yourself.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.655
Francis.

40:11.970 --> 40:13.460
It's Frank.
Ah.

40:13.510 --> 40:14.704
Not to me.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.037
You'll always be Francis.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.934
Or Frannie.

40:20.050 --> 40:21.517
Be safe.

40:21.550 --> 40:23.973
Bye.

40:37.830 --> 40:39.798
Mm. It's starting.

40:39.830 --> 40:44.506
Oh. I bet all Eliot's
been worried about is his hair.

40:44.540 --> 40:46.508
Joining me now is Eliot Delson.

40:46.540 --> 40:49.998
Everyone here at WHN
is so appreciative

40:50.040 --> 40:52.008
of you and your team
at Major Cases.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.075
Uh, Crimes. Major Crimes.

40:54.110 --> 40:55.475
REPORTER:
Right. Sorry.
That's quite all right.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.875
What was the break in the case

40:57.920 --> 40:59.478
that led you
to capture the suspect

40:59.520 --> 41:00.919
in Annabel's tragic murder?

41:00.950 --> 41:03.885
Well, I suppose
a large part of the credit

41:03.920 --> 41:06.059
would have to go to Jay Lee,

41:06.090 --> 41:08.081
one of our master codebreakers
on the task force.
Thank you, Eliot.

41:08.130 --> 41:10.018
He protected your source.
Yep.

41:10.060 --> 41:11.027
REPORTER:
I'd like to introduce
someone now

41:11.060 --> 41:13.563
who just joined our team at WHN
as Correspondent

41:13.600 --> 41:16.899
on Military Affairs, Lieutenant
Colonel Emily Connors.

41:16.940 --> 41:19.636
EMILY:
Happy to be here.

41:19.670 --> 41:21.604
I just have a couple

41:21.640 --> 41:23.232
of follow-up questions for you,
Mr. Delson.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.804
I hope you don't mind.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.499
Not at all.

41:27.050 --> 41:28.244
EMILY:
Great.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.918
She's pretty.

41:29.950 --> 41:32.942
Uh-huh.
She is. Strong,
authoritative.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.083
I mean, I bet
she doesn't have

41:35.120 --> 41:37.088
a highly superior
autobiographical memory

41:37.120 --> 41:39.020
or a deeply tortured soul,
but, you know, you just...

41:39.060 --> 41:40.857
you can't have it all, right?

41:40.890 --> 41:42.050
She's pretty.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.658
Yeah.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.861
My taste in women
is impeccable.

41:45.900 --> 41:47.265
Look in the mirror.

41:47.300 --> 41:50.269
Aw.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.133
You know what's strange?

41:53.170 --> 41:56.071
No matter what we do
or where we go,

41:56.110 --> 42:01.548
somehow we always end up
together, you and me.

42:01.580 --> 42:03.241
And a dartboard.

42:03.280 --> 42:07.216
And your highly superior memory
can't help you throw a dart.

42:07.250 --> 42:10.708
It can help me remember
how many times you lose.

42:10.760 --> 42:12.728
All right. Let's go.

42:12.760 --> 42:14.182
Here.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.198
I'm bringing your drink.
You're gonna need it.
