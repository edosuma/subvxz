WEBVTT

00:06.397 --> 00:08.095
- Previously
on "The Magicians"...

00:08.138 --> 00:09.139
- Christopher Plover.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.227
- The children's book author?

00:10.271 --> 00:11.489
- You're familiar with my work.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.143
- I've read
Martin Chatwin's book.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.711
- Oh, you're the pervert
who turned him into The Beast.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.714
- The age suspension spells
Martin used,

00:18.757 --> 00:20.498
they must still
be keeping me alive.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.500
- I don't know
what this signal is,

00:22.544 --> 00:24.154
but I know why
it's targeting me,

00:24.198 --> 00:26.200
and I'm gonna figure out--
- Whoa, whoa, hang on!

00:26.243 --> 00:28.071
- Merritt, you don't know
what that's gonna do.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.507
- You're right.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.207
- Ever since I found this page,
I knew it was important.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.296
- It's an instruction manual.
- For what?

00:35.339 --> 00:36.384
- The World Seed.

00:36.427 --> 00:37.689
It can grow
into almost anything,

00:37.733 --> 00:39.387
even an entire world.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.215
The Couple has been looking
for the World Seed page

00:41.258 --> 00:43.695
a long time,
and they are not good people.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.697
- And they know
I have what they want.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.438
- Pregnant.

00:47.482 --> 00:48.483
- Shit.

00:48.526 --> 00:49.527
Really appreciate it
if we could

00:49.571 --> 00:50.702
keep this between you and I.

00:50.746 --> 00:51.747
- Of course.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.099
- Let's go find our books,
shall we?

00:56.143 --> 00:58.232
- You better be able
to speed-read.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.104
- No!

01:01.148 --> 01:02.410
- Okay, so what if
we locate the tree

01:02.453 --> 01:04.194
from Seb's tattoo
and chop it down?

01:04.238 --> 01:05.369
Would that sever this conduit?

01:05.413 --> 01:07.371
- In theory, yes,

01:07.415 --> 01:10.548
he would be mortal
and 100% stabbable.

01:19.731 --> 01:22.604
- Jesus, cock and balls,
what's keeping Julia and El?

01:22.647 --> 01:24.432
We just murdered
the goddamn king back there.

01:24.475 --> 01:25.737
They should act like it.
- Ooh, sorry.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.348
Probably just
Julia's toe worms.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.698
Hey, we should stop
so she can catch up.

01:29.741 --> 01:30.829
- You've got toe worms,

01:30.873 --> 01:32.222
and you're moving
at a normal speed.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.745
- Oh, I'm just used to--

01:33.789 --> 01:35.486
Hey, what happened to your eye?

01:35.530 --> 01:37.314
- I lent it to Josh.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.621
- What happened to his eye?

01:39.664 --> 01:41.362
- Nothing!
He's an idiot.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.928
He went back to warn
Tick and Rafe to get out

01:42.972 --> 01:44.756
before things go shit-shaped.
- Okay.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.541
- Wait, and so why did you--

01:46.584 --> 01:50.197
- I'm worried, so I'm
keeping an eye on him, okay?

01:50.240 --> 01:51.589
Christ.
- Oh, it's a pun.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.417
I get it,
'cause you gave him your eye.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.637
- Shut the fuck up, Fen!

01:57.247 --> 01:58.683
- Okay.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.253
- Julia, you have to hurry.
Are you okay?

02:03.297 --> 02:05.342
- Yeah, I'm just
a little out of shape.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.344
- Okay, don't mean to push,
but since we don't know

02:07.388 --> 02:09.259
how the Centurions
will react to Seb's body,

02:09.303 --> 02:11.609
and you were intimately
involved in making him dead,

02:11.653 --> 02:13.916
we should probably
move more quickly.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.874
- Uh...Eliot.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.792
- I wouldn't if I were you.

02:23.969 --> 02:24.927
- Seb.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.537
- Surprised?

02:28.322 --> 02:29.932
Take them.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.865
- Shit.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.263
Sorry about that, Quentin.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.658
Lame-ass Welters nerd.

03:02.051 --> 03:03.661
- Merritt?

03:03.705 --> 03:05.837
- What--what happened?

03:05.881 --> 03:07.317
- You tell me.

03:07.361 --> 03:10.233
You said you were a Chatwin,
you ripped off your patch,

03:10.277 --> 03:11.800
and then you disappeared.

03:11.843 --> 03:14.977
- Where's Julia
and--and Lipson and--

03:16.500 --> 03:18.807
- You've been gone three weeks.

03:19.721 --> 03:20.852
- Wha...

03:22.027 --> 03:23.899
It was just a room.

03:23.942 --> 03:27.337
No windows, no doors,

03:27.381 --> 03:29.252
no one else there.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.993
That's all I remember.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.256
- You remember more than I did
when the signal grabbed me.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.259
But I was there seconds,
at least I thought.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.479
Who knows how this shit works?

03:38.522 --> 03:41.482
- It's a weird one.
- What do your rocks say?

03:42.396 --> 03:45.312
- That young Merritt
isn't under any memory curses,

03:45.355 --> 03:47.444
so far as I can see.

03:47.488 --> 03:50.534
- My name is actually Plum,
remember?

03:50.578 --> 03:52.057
I just have to own it.

03:52.101 --> 03:55.060
Leave the ranks of Chatwins
who go by middle names

03:55.104 --> 03:57.802
or nicknames or, you know,
super-villain monikers.

03:57.846 --> 04:01.458
Hi, Plum fucking Chatwin,
cursed freak.

04:01.502 --> 04:05.027
- Well, on the plus,
you don't have a brain injury,

04:05.070 --> 04:06.333
you aren't psychotic,

04:06.376 --> 04:08.509
and except for
the disorientation

04:08.552 --> 04:11.468
and a little bit
of combination skin,

04:11.512 --> 04:13.731
you're perfectly healthy.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.907
- Whoa, whoa, so--what?

04:15.951 --> 04:17.866
You're done?

04:17.909 --> 04:20.042
- Well, first I'm gonna grab
a bottle of tequila

04:20.085 --> 04:21.478
so that I can really enjoy

04:21.522 --> 04:23.393
my post-coma
limited work hours,

04:23.437 --> 04:24.525
but, uh, after that,

04:24.568 --> 04:26.396
yeah, I'm done.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.835
- Look, this weird room,

04:30.879 --> 04:32.402
that's more
than we've had to go on.

04:32.446 --> 04:35.797
- It's also nothing to go on
at all.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.018
- The way traveling works,

04:40.062 --> 04:42.412
you imagine a place,

04:42.456 --> 04:43.500
see it in your mind's eye,

04:43.544 --> 04:45.589
and then just go.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.330
What?

04:47.374 --> 04:49.550
- You do know this is the most
you've actually taught

04:49.593 --> 04:51.508
about traveling
since you took up here.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.336
- Look, my point is,

04:53.380 --> 04:55.077
you don't have to point
on a map.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.471
Just picture it.

04:57.514 --> 04:58.776
- You want me to go back?

04:58.820 --> 05:00.430
- Not really,
because it's dangerous,

05:00.474 --> 05:01.475
but just pointing out--

05:01.518 --> 05:02.954
- That it's
the only thing we have,

05:02.998 --> 05:04.608
is what you're pointing out.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.741
- When I was a first year,
I had this stupid idea

05:06.784 --> 05:09.134
that teachers knew
a ton more than me.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.614
Gonna blow it for you.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.790
Pretty much no one
knows dick about anything,

05:12.834 --> 05:14.792
especially traveler shit.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.664
What the signal is, why,

05:16.707 --> 05:18.013
no one's waiting around
to solve it.

05:18.056 --> 05:21.016
- But I've never
traveled by myself,

05:21.059 --> 05:22.452
and I don't know how,

05:22.496 --> 05:25.499
and even assuming you're not
completely a shit teacher,

05:25.542 --> 05:27.457
I can't go back there,
not alone.

05:27.501 --> 05:28.850
- You won't be.

05:32.114 --> 05:34.551
- Oh, you stupid twat.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.031
That hurts.

05:36.074 --> 05:38.468
- Kind of late to ask
for the anesthesia spell.

05:41.079 --> 05:42.646
- Done.

05:42.690 --> 05:45.388
Now you can take people
with you when you travel,

05:45.432 --> 05:47.477
which is why it is important
that you--

05:47.521 --> 05:49.436
- Yes, I read the chapters
you gave me.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.829
I get the principles.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.657
- We start with baby steps.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.617
All you gotta do is travel us
both across the lab.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.619
Now, I'm gonna draw a circle.

05:58.662 --> 06:01.404
Just aim for it.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.666
And don't worry.

06:02.710 --> 06:05.016
If you get lost,
I'll be right there.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.541
- Professor Adiyodi...
- It's Penny.

06:07.584 --> 06:08.716
- Bringing you my troubles

06:08.759 --> 06:10.152
has cocked things up
enough already.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.459
I don't wanna make things
worse.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.417
- Yeah, well,
messing up my life

06:14.461 --> 06:15.418
kind of runs in your family.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.550
I'm used to it.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.160
- You're not convincing me.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.078
- Which Chatwin are you
related to?

06:23.121 --> 06:25.428
- Honestly, I don't know.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.516
My parents are British.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.561
They have the proper sense

06:27.604 --> 06:29.650
not to speak
of the family curse.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.652
- Well, you are the third
Chatwin I've met.

06:32.783 --> 06:33.958
First one was The Beast,

06:34.002 --> 06:35.917
who basically tortured me
when I was a kid,

06:35.960 --> 06:38.049
but his sister Jane,

06:38.093 --> 06:40.182
she did everything she could
to stop him.

06:40.225 --> 06:43.228
She changed time.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.622
She was incredible.

06:45.666 --> 06:48.886
So family curse?

06:48.930 --> 06:51.149
Far as I'm concerned,
the scales are even.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.629
You could tip it either way.

06:54.588 --> 06:58.069
Remember, aim for the circle.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.074
Here goes nothing.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.776
I did it.
I actually did it.

07:08.819 --> 07:11.082
I honestly thought I was
just gonna, like, kill us both.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.910
Like, straight up
50/50 chance--

07:12.954 --> 07:15.870
- Plum.
- Yeah.

07:15.913 --> 07:16.958
- Where's the chalk circle?

07:17.001 --> 07:19.917
- It--it's--huh?

07:25.532 --> 07:27.055
- Hey, where's everybody going?

07:27.098 --> 07:29.753
- Dean Shiring got dial-up
in the computer closet.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.755
We're gonna use it
to read the Starr Report,

07:31.799 --> 07:33.801
or at least the blow job parts.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.716
- Dial-up?
- Starr Report?

07:35.759 --> 07:38.762
That came out--oh.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.548
I traveled us to 1998.

07:41.591 --> 07:44.289
- Yeah, well,
I have a strong guess

07:44.333 --> 07:45.987
which Chatwin
you're related to.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.251
- "The Couple"?
Never heard of 'em.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.687
- I hadn't either
until they sent

07:50.731 --> 07:53.560
a shiitake monster after me.

07:53.603 --> 07:54.648
I'd like to know who they are

07:54.691 --> 07:56.214
before they come
looking for me again.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.783
- Well, I know a guy.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.002
He owes me, like, three favors,

08:01.045 --> 08:02.830
so let's see.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.005
- Thanks, Kady.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.183
- Now you owe me three favors.
- Hmm.

08:11.708 --> 08:12.796
- He wants to meet.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.802
You are never
gonna believe where.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.545
What the hell happened here?

08:23.764 --> 08:25.069
- We've been redecorating.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.724
Alice and Kady,
I'm so very glad you've come.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.552
- Zelda.
- What are you doing here?

08:29.596 --> 08:30.988
- Rebuilding.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.294
Come to see George, yes?

08:33.251 --> 08:34.688
- Didn't know you knew him.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.777
- Hmm.
He's right over there.

08:36.820 --> 08:37.778
- Oh.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.303
- Hey, how did all this happen?

08:41.346 --> 08:43.827
Are those hedges
working with librarians?

08:43.871 --> 08:46.177
- Honestly, it was you.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.005
After you helped me
burn all those books,

08:48.049 --> 08:49.180
I realized the Library

08:49.224 --> 08:51.182
needed to be rebuilt
from the ground up.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.967
- How did you convince them
to help you?

08:53.010 --> 08:54.664
- I've been helping
Kady and Harriet

08:54.708 --> 08:55.926
remove Reed's Marks--

08:55.970 --> 08:58.015
a sort of penance,
if we're being honest--

08:58.059 --> 08:59.669
but suddenly I found myself
surrounded

08:59.713 --> 09:02.193
by grateful magicians just
looking for something to do.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.196
- What was that?

09:05.240 --> 09:07.024
- Our new recruits
are enthusiastic,

09:07.068 --> 09:09.026
but their education is spotty.

09:09.070 --> 09:11.681
This branch is kept functioning
by very specific spells,

09:11.725 --> 09:13.727
but proper casting,
especially here

09:13.770 --> 09:15.903
in the Circumstances
of the Neitherlands,

09:15.946 --> 09:17.208
sometimes eludes them.

09:17.252 --> 09:20.951
- Alice, this is George.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.171
- So you're the one
The Couple's after.

09:23.214 --> 09:24.172
- Do you know them?

09:24.215 --> 09:26.609
- No, but I know
a guy who might.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.742
I need a day to track him down.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.701
- Thanks, George.

09:31.745 --> 09:32.920
Two favors to go.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.706
- As long as your waiting,

09:36.750 --> 09:38.665
perhaps you could help us
with a problem?

09:38.708 --> 09:40.362
I've pulled some volumes
from the Poison Room.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.059
Highly dangerous.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.975
You're some of the few
I trust to look through them.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.803
- What are you looking for?

09:46.847 --> 09:48.283
- A way to fix magic.

09:49.937 --> 09:53.593
Unless you have something
more important to do.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.074
- Oh.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.904
- Thank God we got past
the Centurions.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.906
- How the hell's
the Dark King still alive?

10:02.950 --> 10:04.952
We cut down his tree,
stabbed him.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.257
- It doesn't seem possible.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.694
- El said he's a healer.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.130
Maybe he cast something
with his last breath.

10:09.173 --> 10:12.176
I don't know,
but our friends are back there.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.659
I can see Josh hiding out,
so he's safe for now,

10:16.703 --> 10:18.182
but Julia and Eliot...

10:20.881 --> 10:22.273
- Did they get back here
before us?

10:28.845 --> 10:29.803
- Hey!

10:29.846 --> 10:31.674
Who the fuck are you?

10:31.718 --> 10:34.242
- Ah, cello.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.940
Squirrel, daffodil.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.420
- Okay.

10:38.463 --> 10:39.987
- Uh, Margo,
what are you doing?

10:40.030 --> 10:41.292
- Life lesson, Fen.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.294
There's always a point
where you can decide,

10:43.338 --> 10:44.948
"That's not my problem."

10:44.992 --> 10:46.950
- Oh, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

10:46.994 --> 10:50.258
- We have friends to save,
a Dark King to re-kill.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.435
Hang with Mad Libs pedophile
all you want.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.306
I'm going back to double-tap
the motherfucker

10:55.350 --> 10:57.744
like he's Osama
and I'm SEAL Team Bitch.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.746
- No, no.
Excelsior in springtime.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.269
Excelsior in springtime.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.705
- Whatever you say.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.795
- I think he's trying
to tell us something

11:05.839 --> 11:08.798
about Fillory
and the Dark King?

11:09.843 --> 11:11.801
- Charcuterie.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.417
- Either he had a stroke,

11:19.461 --> 11:20.854
or some whimsical
Fillorian shit happened to him.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.203
- Secrets and blueberries.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.292
Spongy walrus hat.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.034
- On the edge
of the Burnt River,

11:27.077 --> 11:28.905
there's an insect called
the Tongue Twister

11:28.949 --> 11:31.429
that supposedly
crawls into your skull

11:31.473 --> 11:32.430
and confuses your words.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.084
Is that like a stroke?

11:34.128 --> 11:35.433
- Fingernail clippings.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.348
- Hold up.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.089
Somebody's near Josh.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.178
Son of a shit,
it's the Dark King.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.353
He's coming.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.529
Wait, no!
God damn it!

11:44.573 --> 11:45.617
- What happened?

11:45.661 --> 11:47.010
- Josh put my eye
in his pocket,

11:47.054 --> 11:48.533
so I can't see shit.

11:49.317 --> 11:52.929
If he's got something to say
about the Dark King,

11:52.973 --> 11:54.452
we need to know it.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.845
- How?

11:55.889 --> 11:57.368
If he's got Tongue Twisters
in his brain hole?

11:57.412 --> 11:58.456
- I know a guy.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.110
He's an idiot,

12:00.154 --> 12:02.330
but he might be able to help.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.815
- Professor Fogg?

12:09.990 --> 12:11.295
- Hi.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.993
- Ski masks.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.213
Big trend in the future?

12:16.257 --> 12:17.911
- Trying to avoid
a time paradox.

12:17.954 --> 12:21.044
- Ah, smart and stupid.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.959
You don't think I'll recognize
your voices?

12:23.003 --> 12:24.613
- Kind of counted on you
being a little drunk.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.093
- Hmm.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.485
- It's the afternoon.

12:27.529 --> 12:30.140
- Next time,
try Pinter's facial distortion,

12:30.184 --> 12:31.968
literally made
for this sort of thing,

12:32.012 --> 12:34.971
unless you, you know,
prefer this look.

12:35.015 --> 12:38.322
- Yeah, look, what do you know
about time travelers?

12:39.889 --> 12:40.934
They're a myth.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.414
- And yet, here we are.

12:43.458 --> 12:48.289
- Well, seems like you have
a gift, Ms. Ski Mask,

12:48.332 --> 12:50.160
but poor aim.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.032
- Can you help?

12:53.163 --> 12:54.208
- Maybe.

12:56.993 --> 13:00.214
This time bridge is set
for a fixed moment in time,

13:00.257 --> 13:04.348
but we can remove
the temporal compass

13:04.392 --> 13:09.223
and adjust it to help you
navigate back to 2020.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.007
Can you feel the vibration?
- Yeah.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.183
- Good.
It's pointing towards home.

13:13.227 --> 13:14.445
- Thanks, Professor Fogg.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.317
- No, gosh,
thank you, thank you.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.536
This might all make
an excellent dissertation.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.408
- Might even be worth
a promotion.

13:20.451 --> 13:21.670
- Oh, God, no.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.454
Me, Dean?
No.

13:23.498 --> 13:26.370
I'd have to pay off
a lot of colleagues' wives.

13:28.416 --> 13:29.809
Good luck.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.341
- Did it work?

13:40.384 --> 13:41.995
Are we back?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.344
- I don't know.

13:53.136 --> 13:54.398
- Excuse me.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.052
Be a pal and sweep up
the men's dining room?

13:56.096 --> 13:57.097
Thanks.

13:59.664 --> 14:00.665
- Nope.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.278
- How is Seb still alive?

14:04.321 --> 14:05.583
- I have no idea.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.456
I mean, you saw me
run him through with a sword,

14:08.499 --> 14:10.762
which is not something
I expected to do

14:10.806 --> 14:13.287
to anyone, kind of ever.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.161
- You okay?

14:18.205 --> 14:20.381
- Yeah, um,
I just have a problem,

14:20.424 --> 14:21.948
and it's getting worse.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.521
- How'd you get so pregnant?

14:30.565 --> 14:33.698
- The usual way,
except it's Red Monkey Month,

14:33.742 --> 14:36.266
so everything grows
a lot faster.

14:36.310 --> 14:39.443
- I guess...

14:39.487 --> 14:40.967
congratulations?

14:44.013 --> 14:46.581
Ugh.
- Thanks, I think.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.017
- Present deal aside,

14:48.061 --> 14:50.237
the whole circle of life
of this,

14:50.280 --> 14:51.803
it's kind of very moving.

14:51.847 --> 14:53.805
- In a far less
dungeon-y timeline,

14:53.849 --> 14:55.677
I'd definitely be asking you

14:55.720 --> 14:57.722
to throw me a baby shower
right about now.

14:57.766 --> 15:00.116
- I know a spell
to make sparkling cider

15:00.160 --> 15:01.335
get you hammered.

15:01.378 --> 15:02.510
Perfect loophole
for this situation.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.817
- Glad to see you're
keeping your spirits up.

15:05.861 --> 15:08.733
I wouldn't want it
gloomy down here.

15:08.777 --> 15:11.432
And now I've killed
the conversation.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.654
- Are you going to execute us?

15:16.698 --> 15:19.005
- I can't.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.484
I need your help.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.272
- Basic problem's the same.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.796
We can't fix magic on Earth.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.712
We did some stuff to the moon,
and she's mad, and she's--

15:30.755 --> 15:34.324
- A monumental cunt?
- Evidently.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.413
So she's screwing up
Circumstances.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.679
- My Akkadian's rusty,
but I--I think this says

15:41.723 --> 15:47.076
that we can win
the moon's favor if we...

15:47.120 --> 15:48.599
- Virgin sacrifice.

15:48.643 --> 15:51.037
- Okay, well, that's out.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.081
- Not to mention,

15:52.125 --> 15:54.214
the method of death
is pretty gross.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.520
Ugh.

15:56.564 --> 15:57.695
- That bad, huh?

15:57.739 --> 15:59.610
- No, it's just
the lights flickered,

15:59.654 --> 16:03.440
and now there's peanut butter
in my turkey sandwich.

16:04.572 --> 16:07.444
- Thought wonky casting
was an Earth-specific problem.

16:07.488 --> 16:10.056
- I think this issue's
more basic.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.188
All the new people
learning Library operations,

16:12.232 --> 16:14.538
including culinary charms.

16:14.582 --> 16:17.889
- At least Zelda can reassign
hedges that cast for shit.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.283
The moon, however,
has job security.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.546
- Hmm.
You're fired, Moon.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.202
Wait, what if we could?

16:27.247 --> 16:29.336
Fire the moon, I mean.

16:29.379 --> 16:30.467
- Kind of remember hearing

16:30.511 --> 16:32.208
Earth would end
in fiery apocalypse.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.471
- No, I'm saying,
what if we got rid of it

16:34.515 --> 16:35.690
and made a new one?

16:37.909 --> 16:39.607
That's batshit.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.522
- This book is on
Earth-works magic

16:41.565 --> 16:43.741
in the South Pacific.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.787
You know, how to create
an island out of nothing.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.398
- Ye--that's not exactly
the same.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.357
- These books are from
the Poison Room,

16:50.400 --> 16:51.488
not for amateurs.

16:51.532 --> 16:52.750
If there's a way
to make a new moon,

16:52.794 --> 16:53.751
it'll be in here.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.283
- Say, "Ah."
- Fire engine.

17:04.936 --> 17:07.374
- Well, there's your problem.
He can't talk right.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.158
- No shit, Gordy.
We wanna know why.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.508
- Check his ears.
Anything in there?

17:11.552 --> 17:12.640
- Hmm.

17:12.683 --> 17:15.512
Just your usual ear stuff.

17:15.556 --> 17:18.124
Hold up, what is that?

17:18.167 --> 17:20.430
Give me a minute.
It's deep in there.

17:21.388 --> 17:24.217
And blammo.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.569
- Yep, it's a Tongue Twister.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.049
- How you feeling now?

17:30.092 --> 17:32.181
Linoleum.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.965
- Shit, it wasn't the bug.

17:34.009 --> 17:36.316
- Huh, well,
maybe not this one.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.622
There's a bunch in there.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.972
Hundreds.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.539
Thousands.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.151
All down his--mm...

17:45.194 --> 17:47.022
spinal bones?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.938
I can get 'em out
if I can keep one.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.071
- Sure I'll regret asking.
Why?

17:52.114 --> 17:54.029
- For the respect.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.163
So I can write a...
a...

17:57.206 --> 17:59.643
- Paper?
- Right, one of those.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.993
It'd be huge for me.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.517
I'll never get laughed at
at VetCon again.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.475
- How long is it gonna take?

18:05.519 --> 18:07.390
- Don't know.

18:07.434 --> 18:10.611
Looks like each critter
has an energy-meridian tether

18:10.654 --> 18:12.526
as well as a physical one.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.005
It's like he's possessed

18:14.049 --> 18:16.965
by a thousand little spirits,
so...

18:17.008 --> 18:18.662
- This is a possession problem?

18:18.706 --> 18:20.577
- No, it's a bug problem,

18:20.621 --> 18:22.971
and those bugs
are possessing him.

18:27.715 --> 18:30.021
- Don't worry.
I deal with cats all day.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.111
They are possessed
like you wouldn't believe.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.329
- Rhubarb.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.425
- That should do it.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.036
- He's bleeding out!
Call a doctor!

18:46.473 --> 18:48.170
Oh, yeah.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.656
- 1920.

18:55.699 --> 18:58.789
- Maybe Fogg flipped a digit
setting it.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.313
If we can figure out
what he got wrong,

19:00.356 --> 19:02.097
we can fix his mistake.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.187
I just wish we had
some instructions.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.146
- Excuse me.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.149
This area is for students
and faculty only.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.802
- I am faculty.
- I'm a student.

19:11.846 --> 19:15.066
- And I am the King of Siam.
Out.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.329
- Look, dude,
I don't know wha--

19:16.372 --> 19:17.460
- Yeah, getting in a fight

19:17.504 --> 19:19.070
is only gonna make this harder.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.465
Thank you.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.737
- If we can't
get in the Library,

19:33.781 --> 19:36.087
then we are stuck here
reenacting "The Help"

19:36.131 --> 19:37.480
with these casually racist
white people.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.395
- Lilian,
you're imagining things.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.658
- We don't know anyone here
who can help us.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.270
- I swear, Helen,
I could sense something--

19:44.313 --> 19:47.795
someone--
watching me in the bath,

19:47.838 --> 19:50.711
like--like a pervert ghost.

19:52.539 --> 19:55.585
- Maybe we do know someone
who can help.

19:56.717 --> 20:00.199
- "Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought,

20:00.242 --> 20:03.463
"perplexed in the extreme;

20:03.506 --> 20:07.206
"of one whose hand,
like the base Indian,

20:07.249 --> 20:10.078
threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe..."

20:10.121 --> 20:13.603
- You're telling me
this guy whacks off to people

20:13.647 --> 20:16.215
he watches
from the Astral Plane?

20:17.390 --> 20:20.436
- Yeah.
- "The melting mood..."

20:20.480 --> 20:23.222
- Do we really need his help?
- "As the Arabian trees..."

20:23.265 --> 20:24.397
- Look, in 100 years,

20:24.440 --> 20:26.834
he's gonna be
a really nice guy, so...

20:28.444 --> 20:30.490
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.187
It just, it--ah.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.451
It won't feel like "Othello"
until I'm in blackface.

20:36.626 --> 20:39.325
- Okay, so he's got
a ways to go.

20:39.368 --> 20:40.587
Hyman.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.241
Hey.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.677
- Do I know you?

20:43.720 --> 20:48.682
- Uh, yeah, I'm Pen--brooke,
and this is Prune.

20:48.725 --> 20:53.556
- Ah, and you are
visiting mystics?

20:53.600 --> 20:57.343
- Right, from India, and--
- And the--

20:57.386 --> 20:59.127
- The Dark Continent.
- Okay.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.650
- God give me strength.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.652
- Yeah, well, listen,
we needed some help--

21:02.696 --> 21:03.914
- I'm sorry.
I'm late to phrenology.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.351
- Okay, buddy.

21:05.394 --> 21:08.397
Listen up, dude.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.921
We know you're the pervert
ghost of Brakebills,

21:10.965 --> 21:14.490
so either you help us,
or everybody knows.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.930
- I've looked through
everything Seb gave us,

21:19.974 --> 21:23.891
and it seems like some sort
of communication spell.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.849
It's going to take
the three of us.

21:26.894 --> 21:30.941
I have no clue
what it does, though.

21:33.422 --> 21:34.858
- El?

21:34.902 --> 21:36.469
Help here?

21:36.512 --> 21:38.775
What's the point?

21:38.819 --> 21:41.865
Once we're done, what reason
does he have to keep us alive?

21:42.866 --> 21:45.347
- I don't think he'll kill us.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.914
You.

21:47.741 --> 21:50.178
I saw the way he talked to you.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.441
Nobody is that hurt
if they don't care.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.663
- I attract the best guys,
don't I?

21:57.838 --> 22:00.536
- You attract
basically everyone,

22:00.580 --> 22:02.321
and with that broad
of an appeal,

22:02.364 --> 22:03.409
you're bound to magnetize

22:03.452 --> 22:04.932
a couple of questionable
monarchs.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.328
- We will figure something out.
I promise.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.329
- Okay.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.463
- Help.
- Okay.

22:17.771 --> 22:20.991
- This sigil,
it looks sort of like

22:21.035 --> 22:22.863
part of a messenger charm
that you would use

22:22.906 --> 22:25.300
to send a letter
across a lake or a river--

22:25.344 --> 22:26.649
- Oh, shit.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.869
Yeah, I recognize it.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.827
Um, it was in a book

22:30.871 --> 22:33.917
I was reading
right after Q died.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.703
I was doing a lot of...
- Grief Googling?

22:38.487 --> 22:40.489
- He wants to do a séance.

22:40.533 --> 22:41.838
- But I thought
those were bullshit.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.536
- Not always.

22:43.579 --> 22:47.278
It's dark magic,
and it can go very wrong.

22:47.322 --> 22:49.933
I never could figure it out,
but maybe he did.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.413
- But why cooperative?

22:51.457 --> 22:52.893
Three people
means a lot of power.

22:52.936 --> 22:55.286
- Well, he must be trying
to contact someone

22:55.330 --> 22:57.767
who's been dead
a very long time.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.682
- Oh, shit.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.772
I think I know who.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.039
- Hello, Professor Frank.

23:10.519 --> 23:13.435
- Those two can't be in here
during regular hours.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.263
- Uh, they're with me.

23:15.306 --> 23:17.961
I'm doing a report
on magic of the West Indies.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.921
They are translating for me.

23:20.964 --> 23:21.922
- Huh.

23:24.141 --> 23:27.101
- Nothing, nothing.
There is nothing here.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.016
It is all theoretical.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.410
There's not even an entry
for a temporal compass.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.020
- As far as I can tell,
time bridges

23:33.063 --> 23:34.761
haven't even been
invented yet.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.808
- Time bridges?

23:38.852 --> 23:40.244
Like Professor Sato's work?

23:43.509 --> 23:44.466
- Is that...

23:46.076 --> 23:48.035
Hey.
- Yeah.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.994
- This looks exactly like
the time bridge

23:51.038 --> 23:53.301
that we pulled
the compass out of.

23:53.344 --> 23:56.435
He's building it...
- Today.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.393
That can't be a coincidence.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.482
- But still,
it doesn't make any sense.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.179
I mean, why take us here,
to today?

24:02.223 --> 24:04.051
And why 1998?

24:04.094 --> 24:06.183
- Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh...

24:06.227 --> 24:10.231
You traveled
to the year of our Lord 1998?

24:10.274 --> 24:12.973
No, no, no.
Horsefeathers.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.541
What, was the world overrun
with metal automatons

24:15.584 --> 24:18.065
taking over
all the work of men?

24:18.108 --> 24:19.893
- Yes.
- Look.

24:19.936 --> 24:20.937
Oh, my God.

24:20.981 --> 24:22.417
- September, 1998.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.767
- I was holding it
when we traveled to 1998,

24:24.811 --> 24:27.770
and then I was
holding the compass

24:27.814 --> 24:30.860
that was made today
when we landed here today.

24:30.904 --> 24:33.210
- Oh, they're totems.

24:34.864 --> 24:37.998
Remedial traveler students
sometimes have trouble

24:38.041 --> 24:41.044
picturing their destinations,
so holding an object

24:41.088 --> 24:42.916
from that place
can sometimes help.

24:42.959 --> 24:46.833
- Okay, so that,
but time instead of space.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.791
So I guess in order
to get home...

24:48.835 --> 24:50.227
- We need something
from our time.

24:50.271 --> 24:52.795
- "From our time,"
I was gonna say that.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.281
- Hey, you know this language?

25:02.588 --> 25:04.285
- Um...

25:04.328 --> 25:07.462
the front half looks like
Old Church Slavonic.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.029
The back half,
I don't recognize it.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.813
- The Slavonic part
I could read.

25:10.857 --> 25:14.121
It's something about a seed
that could grow into anything.

25:14.164 --> 25:18.081
What if it could
grow into a moon?

25:26.394 --> 25:28.309
- I don't believe it.
- What?

25:31.355 --> 25:33.836
- This book is missing a page,

25:33.880 --> 25:35.838
something called
the World Seed.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.057
- How do you know
what it's about

25:37.100 --> 25:38.275
if the page is missing?

25:39.668 --> 25:41.409
- Because it's what
The Couple's after,

25:41.452 --> 25:44.238
the page, and I have it.

25:44.281 --> 25:45.718
- What?

25:45.761 --> 25:48.851
- Meanwhile, we're trying
to solve a different problem,

25:48.895 --> 25:51.593
but then--but there's this book
that happens to be

25:51.637 --> 25:54.465
the same book that
the World Seed page came from?

25:54.509 --> 25:57.164
Coincidence,
synchronicity, or...

25:57.207 --> 25:58.992
- I always assume trap.

25:59.035 --> 26:01.124
- How much do you
trust the hedges?

26:01.168 --> 26:03.387
- About as much
as you trust the Library.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.172
- Hmm.

26:05.215 --> 26:08.088
Then there's no way
this isn't a con.

26:08.131 --> 26:11.352
- We're looking for an answer
that requires unusual power.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.484
Something unusually powerful.

26:13.528 --> 26:16.270
Logically, it's gonna be rare,

26:16.313 --> 26:17.619
a lot of people wanting it,
right?

26:17.663 --> 26:21.188
So not weird, right?

26:23.059 --> 26:25.018
Just saying.
- True.

26:25.061 --> 26:28.282
I mean, it can't be this easy,
can it?

26:28.325 --> 26:30.632
- Maybe everything's been
really hard for a long time,

26:30.676 --> 26:33.330
and we caught a single
fucking break for once.

26:36.116 --> 26:38.292
- Oh, hey,
Smoothie Castle card

26:38.335 --> 26:40.686
from 2009.

26:40.729 --> 26:44.690
- So we don't have anything
from 2020?

26:44.733 --> 26:47.997
Great, so we're just stuck
in this backwards-ass place.

26:49.129 --> 26:50.434
- Did you do this?

26:50.478 --> 26:51.610
- Do what?

26:51.653 --> 26:54.395
- Brakebills has given me
the icy mitt.

26:54.438 --> 26:56.179
I've been streeted.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.225
Oh, my--expelled!

26:58.268 --> 27:00.401
Someone ratted me out
to the faculty.

27:00.444 --> 27:01.663
- Well, it wasn't us.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.449
Someone must have overheard
our conversation.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.713
- Wha--eavesdropping
on a private moment?

27:07.756 --> 27:08.714
Who would do that?

27:08.757 --> 27:11.194
- You, constantly,

27:11.238 --> 27:14.284
which is why
you're getting expelled.

27:16.156 --> 27:19.986
- Did you give her permission
to use irony in this way?

27:20.029 --> 27:24.033
Just--good riddance
to the both of you.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.122
- This is bad.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.647
He was supposed to stay,
get caught projecting,

27:28.690 --> 27:30.997
and then be trapped
when someone hides his body.

27:31.040 --> 27:34.261
- Okay, so then expulsion
actually saves him

27:34.304 --> 27:37.438
from being trapped in
Astral Purgatory for a century

27:37.481 --> 27:40.267
and saves generations
of Brakebills women

27:40.310 --> 27:42.486
from being spied on.
- You don't get it.

27:42.530 --> 27:45.489
If Hyman doesn't get trapped,
he can't help future me,

27:45.533 --> 27:50.233
and future me can't save magic,
and we lose it forever.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.281
We need to fix this.

27:54.324 --> 27:55.630
How?

27:55.674 --> 27:58.764
By trapping him ourselves?

27:58.807 --> 28:00.243
- Exactly.

28:02.028 --> 28:03.159
- Wait.

28:11.385 --> 28:15.215
On the bright side, this is my
chance to finally go to Europe.

28:17.347 --> 28:19.088
I hear Weimar Berlin's
got some swell

28:19.132 --> 28:20.611
"erotique" attractions.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.223
- I bet.

28:28.054 --> 28:30.186
- God, what am I doing?

28:30.230 --> 28:32.667
I came to Brakebills
to learn, you know?

28:32.711 --> 28:35.322
And the lesson of my expulsion
is clear as a creek.

28:35.365 --> 28:39.369
Maybe, and I know
this is crazy,

28:39.413 --> 28:44.157
but maybe it is wrong
to spy on people in the shower.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.724
- Well...

28:45.767 --> 28:47.377
- I know!

28:47.421 --> 28:49.597
Then why did God
give you the ability

28:49.640 --> 28:51.730
to spy on people in the shower?

28:54.210 --> 28:56.473
- Look, I can't tell you
how to live your life, but...

28:59.302 --> 29:01.522
Look, being a traveler
can feel like a burden, yes,

29:01.565 --> 29:05.439
but not being a traveler,

29:05.482 --> 29:07.093
not being able
to use your gift,

29:07.136 --> 29:08.529
it's worse.

29:08.572 --> 29:09.748
Believe me.

29:12.402 --> 29:15.188
There's no harm
in looking, right?

29:16.493 --> 29:18.582
You know?

29:18.626 --> 29:21.716
- Oh.
- You're a good egg, Penbrooke.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.761
- Okay.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.504
- Hey, before I forget,

29:27.548 --> 29:29.855
any idea how I can
score some tickets

29:29.898 --> 29:31.247
to the women's Welters match?

29:31.291 --> 29:32.596
It's in an hour.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.775
- Women's Welters
has a match tonight?

29:36.818 --> 29:39.299
That's not on the schedule.

29:39.342 --> 29:41.562
- Oh, it's a surprise match,
yeah.

29:43.303 --> 29:46.741
They are probably
in the locker room right now.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.309
- Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh,
I see.

29:49.352 --> 29:52.747
I am going to need
to finish packing by myself.

29:54.531 --> 29:55.663
In private, okay?

29:55.706 --> 29:57.273
- Yeah, okay. Cool.

29:57.317 --> 29:59.885
Great.
Uh, yeah, bye.

30:05.281 --> 30:06.326
Okay, it worked.
We only have a few minutes.

30:06.369 --> 30:09.285
- Okay, um,
hear me out on something.

30:09.329 --> 30:10.504
- Yes, it's bad.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.592
Magic's at stake.

30:11.635 --> 30:12.593
Do I have to do
the speech again?

30:12.636 --> 30:13.812
- I stole this

30:13.855 --> 30:15.422
from Professor Sato's things.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.859
Stasis charm,
freezes the wearer in time.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.819
- Plum, the body isn't
supposed to be preserved.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.821
It's supposed to die.
- Who says?

30:22.864 --> 30:24.474
- No one ever found his body.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.520
Maybe we were the ones
who hid it in the first place.

30:26.563 --> 30:27.782
- That's not how time works.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.262
How do you know?

30:29.305 --> 30:31.568
What matters is he'd
still be trapped

30:31.612 --> 30:32.787
and still be on
the Astral Plane.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.571
- Unless it's
a shitty hiding spot,

30:34.615 --> 30:35.572
and Hyman finds it.

30:35.616 --> 30:36.747
- Unless he doesn't,

30:36.791 --> 30:39.228
and 100 years from now
we can fix him.

30:39.272 --> 30:41.665
What's the point of having
this stupid ability

30:41.709 --> 30:43.363
if I can't change anything?

30:43.406 --> 30:44.712
- Who says there's a point?

30:44.755 --> 30:45.931
You are born with this shit,

30:45.974 --> 30:47.323
and you spend the rest
of your life

30:47.367 --> 30:48.368
trying to survive it.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.283
Okay? Let's go.

30:51.458 --> 30:53.939
- Or you have it ripped away

30:53.982 --> 30:56.289
just when you figured out
you wanted it.

30:56.332 --> 31:00.423
I am sorry your shit is broken,
but the Penny I've heard about

31:00.467 --> 31:02.817
wouldn't give a damn whether it
fucks the future or not.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.863
He would do the right thing
for his friend.

31:06.690 --> 31:08.692
- I guess having your shit
break changes a person.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.303
- Okay,

31:10.346 --> 31:13.523
so what kind of person
is new Penny gonna be?

31:17.745 --> 31:19.225
- Shit.

31:19.268 --> 31:20.748
I know how to get us
back home.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.491
Let's do this,
and I'll explain.

31:24.534 --> 31:25.971
- Okay.

31:26.014 --> 31:28.277
Gonna be sore
when he wakes up.

31:29.539 --> 31:31.846
- If he wakes up.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.201
You ready to go?
- Yeah.

31:39.245 --> 31:42.291
"Quentin Coldwater,
Welters"--

31:42.335 --> 31:44.206
how does that help?

31:44.250 --> 31:45.773
- I dropped it the day
you reappeared.

31:45.816 --> 31:48.428
When it broke, it...

31:48.471 --> 31:49.690
- Became a new thing.

31:49.733 --> 31:53.476
- Made the day we left,
so shall we?

31:53.520 --> 31:54.738
- Yeah.

31:59.613 --> 32:00.875
- He's stable.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.398
- Thank you.

32:02.442 --> 32:03.834
- And talking words good.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.706
My work here is done.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.490
Respect, here I come.

32:07.534 --> 32:09.275
- Oh!
- Shit.

32:12.669 --> 32:15.455
- All right, talk.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.718
- It's been centuries
since I've been able to speak.

32:17.761 --> 32:20.590
It's so liberating.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.679
- You've been infected
for centuries?

32:22.723 --> 32:26.727
- Yes, from the--just after
your reign ended until today.

32:26.770 --> 32:29.338
- Tell us everything
that happened.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.253
- Screw that.
What's up with the Dark King?

32:31.297 --> 32:32.559
Who is he,
where does he come from,

32:32.602 --> 32:34.387
and how do we kill him?

32:34.430 --> 32:37.999
- Well, I heard
the same story you did.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.567
The Dark King showed up

32:40.610 --> 32:42.917
shortly after the arrival
of The Takers,

32:42.961 --> 32:45.789
that only he
could vanquish them.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.357
So I was curious.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.272
Who was this Magician?

32:50.316 --> 32:51.491
What was his story?

32:51.534 --> 32:53.362
So I sought him out,

32:53.406 --> 32:56.278
and I was shocked to discover

32:56.322 --> 32:57.323
that I knew him.

32:58.759 --> 33:01.544
Ooh, you are good
at telling stories.

33:01.588 --> 33:02.719
- Thank you.

33:02.763 --> 33:06.636
Now, in order to talk
about who he is

33:06.680 --> 33:08.943
and where he actually
came from,

33:08.987 --> 33:10.945
we need to look further back

33:10.989 --> 33:14.383
to a time before Martin Chatwin
became The Beast.

33:14.427 --> 33:15.950
- Really?
- Shh.

33:15.994 --> 33:19.519
- Long before he discovered
the Wellspring,

33:19.562 --> 33:22.043
Martin had another plan

33:22.087 --> 33:25.568
to make sure that he never
got sent back to Earth.

33:25.612 --> 33:29.529
A conduit spell
to tie himself to Fillory.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.792
- Once we begin, we will
only have a few moments.

33:33.968 --> 33:37.754
- Seb, we should talk
about this.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.495
- Look, we know
what you're trying to do.

33:39.539 --> 33:40.975
- I strongly doubt that.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.063
- We know it.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.456
The Dark King used it,

33:43.499 --> 33:45.023
except we chopped down
his tree.

33:45.066 --> 33:47.808
- But there's an essential fact

33:47.851 --> 33:50.767
that perhaps you don't know
about the trees of Fillory.

33:50.811 --> 33:54.989
You see, there are many,
but in truth, only one.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.991
- What kind of bullshit
is that?

33:57.035 --> 34:00.081
- Yeah, I mean, I'm Fillorian,
and I've never heard that.

34:00.125 --> 34:03.563
- You see, the roots of
the trees of Fillory intertwine

34:03.606 --> 34:06.566
such that they become one,
not just with each other,

34:06.609 --> 34:09.786
but with the land,
and anyone tied to that

34:09.830 --> 34:12.528
can't be killed by just
chopping down a single tree

34:12.572 --> 34:14.835
or even an entire forest.

34:14.878 --> 34:19.013
They can only be stopped
by destroying all of Fillory.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.494
- Wait, so you're saying
Martin tried,

34:21.537 --> 34:22.625
but screwed up or whatever?

34:22.669 --> 34:25.846
- He was thwarted
by someone heroic

34:25.889 --> 34:27.543
who knew what he could become,

34:27.587 --> 34:30.981
Martin's own brother Rupert,

34:31.025 --> 34:33.680
Rupert Sebastian Chatwin.

34:33.723 --> 34:36.900
- Oh, my Gods, what a twist.

34:36.944 --> 34:38.641
You're such a natural at this.

34:38.685 --> 34:40.556
- He realized
that the only way

34:40.600 --> 34:42.558
to stop his brother
was sacrifice,

34:42.602 --> 34:44.865
so he tied himself
to the conduit

34:44.908 --> 34:46.127
before his brother could.

34:46.171 --> 34:48.738
When Martin discovered
what had happened,

34:48.782 --> 34:50.958
oh, he was furious.

34:51.001 --> 34:53.526
He couldn't kill
his own brother,

34:53.569 --> 34:56.877
but he could curse him
with eternal sleep.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.966
The people of Fillory
thought he was dead.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.758
- What's happening to him?
- Exactly what's meant to.

35:10.978 --> 35:12.414
- What happened?

35:12.458 --> 35:14.634
- You happened.

35:14.677 --> 35:20.074
You brought surges of magic
so huge you woke Rupert up,

35:20.118 --> 35:21.684
and he brought The Takers,

35:21.728 --> 35:23.904
and then when he held them
at bay,

35:23.947 --> 35:27.429
the Fillorians, in gratitude,
made him High King.

35:27.473 --> 35:31.825
- But why did he do all that?

35:31.868 --> 35:35.742
- Yeah, if he was so good,
why did he become so evil?

35:35.785 --> 35:38.571
- Because while he slumbered,

35:38.614 --> 35:41.922
he lost the one thing
he cared about,

35:41.965 --> 35:43.619
the man he loved.

35:48.233 --> 35:51.627
- Rupert, is that really you?

35:51.671 --> 35:52.759
- Lance!

35:52.802 --> 35:54.152
- Lance?

35:54.195 --> 35:56.110
- Lance Morrison?
- Rupert.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.943
- Yes, yes, it's me.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.858
- Finally, you're here.

36:04.901 --> 36:07.469
My love, my stars, my heart.

36:07.513 --> 36:09.689
I sound like a fool.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.170
You cannot know...

36:12.213 --> 36:14.737
Do you know how much
I've missed you?

36:18.698 --> 36:20.047
- What took you so long?

36:21.744 --> 36:23.224
- Lance, I've been trying.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.228
- You left me.
- No.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.621
- You abandoned me.

36:28.664 --> 36:30.492
- No, I needed
to stop my brother.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.973
- And now I'm dead,
and you can never die.

36:35.541 --> 36:38.587
It's cold here.
I'm so alone.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.852
I've almost given up
so many times.

36:42.896 --> 36:45.203
- No, no, just--don't.

36:45.246 --> 36:48.162
I will not break my promise
to you, okay?

36:48.206 --> 36:50.033
I finally know what to do.

36:50.077 --> 36:52.166
We'll be together soon,
so soon.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.037
- How?
- Just wait by the door.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.997
- I've tried.
I can't pass through it.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.217
- No, I know, but you will
be able to soon.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.522
That's why
I reached out to you,

37:00.566 --> 37:02.002
to tell you to wait
by the door.

37:02.045 --> 37:04.700
Okay, okay.

37:08.661 --> 37:10.010
Rupert...

37:10.053 --> 37:11.011
- Listen to me.

37:11.054 --> 37:12.839
Wait by the door.

37:12.882 --> 37:14.101
- Eliot.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.147
What the fuck did you do?

37:19.324 --> 37:20.760
- And you actually think
this page

37:20.803 --> 37:21.891
might contain the answer?

37:23.066 --> 37:24.198
Tell us what you need.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.069
Our resources
are at your disposal.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.680
- I just need to go and get it.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.072
- We'll send someone.

37:29.116 --> 37:30.944
- I'd rather get it myself.

37:30.987 --> 37:32.946
- A few librarians, security--

37:32.989 --> 37:34.730
seems prudent
to send one person.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.733
- You almost had me.

37:37.777 --> 37:41.302
Just peanut butter
and turkey sandwiches.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.043
- I'm afraid I'm not following.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.741
- We're in the Library,
where there's glitches

37:45.785 --> 37:47.787
'cause of hedges right?

37:47.830 --> 37:49.223
So why do these glitches
keep happening

37:49.267 --> 37:50.703
during lunar intervals?

37:50.746 --> 37:52.879
Why are the Neitherlands
affected by the Earth's moon?

37:52.922 --> 37:55.142
Makes no sense.
Where am I really?

37:57.797 --> 38:00.234
- Earth, which you manage
to figure out

38:00.278 --> 38:01.757
every motherfucking time.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.242
- What is this?
Some sort of illusion?

38:08.286 --> 38:09.722
- Psychic spell.

38:09.765 --> 38:11.332
Basically you're in the Matrix,

38:11.376 --> 38:14.857
which means we're still
on Earth, hence glitches.

38:14.901 --> 38:16.903
- How many times
have I done this?

38:16.946 --> 38:18.078
- 18.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.342
Been sending you back
to the beginning.

38:21.386 --> 38:22.909
It's getting tiresome.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.998
- Wait, the--the books,
fixing the moon,

38:25.041 --> 38:26.739
it was all just--
- Bullshit.

38:26.782 --> 38:29.350
Starting with you
getting Kady to text me.

38:29.394 --> 38:30.960
- Who are you?
- Come on.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.353
I'm insulted.

38:32.397 --> 38:35.095
You've been asking about me.

38:35.138 --> 38:36.357
- The Couple.

38:36.401 --> 38:37.619
- Less impressive

38:37.663 --> 38:39.882
the 18th time
you figure it out.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.144
Look, you're sick of this.

38:41.188 --> 38:42.581
I'm really sick of this.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.671
Why don't we have this convo
in the real world, huh?

38:49.936 --> 38:52.417
Not doing this 19 times.

38:52.460 --> 38:55.420
Give me the page,
or I kill Kady.

39:02.688 --> 39:05.430
- How do I know
that's really Kady?

39:05.473 --> 39:07.170
How do I know
this is even real?

39:08.433 --> 39:10.391
- Only one way to know,

39:10.435 --> 39:12.654
and that's to feel it.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.398
- What are you doing?

39:17.442 --> 39:20.401
- Phosphoromancer, right?

39:20.445 --> 39:21.663
- Please don't do this.

39:21.707 --> 39:22.838
Please, please.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.405
- I know you use
this finger a lot.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.892
- Promise--
give me the page.

39:32.935 --> 39:35.285
If the finger's still viable,
I reattach.

39:41.553 --> 39:45.774
- Middle finger,
also very important.

39:49.256 --> 39:50.736
- Love spells
need a ring finger.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.260
- Oh...

39:53.303 --> 39:54.653
- Pinkies are crucial.

40:03.226 --> 40:06.665
- Well? Alice?

40:07.970 --> 40:09.189
- Okay.

40:10.233 --> 40:11.931
Okay.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.628
You want my thumb too?

40:16.501 --> 40:18.851
- Disappointed
that this isn't working,

40:18.894 --> 40:21.462
because the next cut
isn't your thumb.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.377
It's Kady.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.816
- The page, or kill Kady.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.644
What's it gonna be?

40:29.688 --> 40:33.474
- Okay, okay, you win.
It's yours.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.998
It's--it's fucking yours.

40:36.042 --> 40:37.957
- Oh, good.

40:40.263 --> 40:41.482
- Relieved.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.615
Now, where do I go?

40:43.658 --> 40:45.486
Oh, hold that thought.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.619
I forgot my pen.

40:49.577 --> 40:51.840
Okay.

41:00.588 --> 41:01.546
- Is he all right?

41:01.589 --> 41:03.591
- What do you care?

41:03.635 --> 41:06.855
- It was never my intention
to hurt him.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.988
- You think that matters?

41:11.991 --> 41:13.732
I lost someone too.

41:15.385 --> 41:17.300
And I loved him so much.

41:18.650 --> 41:20.260
I know the pain.

41:22.088 --> 41:23.655
It's not an excuse
to hurt people

41:23.698 --> 41:25.526
just because you want him back.

41:28.573 --> 41:31.401
- Maybe you didn't love him
as much as you think,

41:31.445 --> 41:34.317
because you don't understand.

41:35.623 --> 41:36.929
I have work to do.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.718
- You see
what you're up against.

41:43.762 --> 41:45.894
Fillory can never be free

41:45.938 --> 41:49.289
so long as the Dark King
reigns.

41:49.332 --> 41:51.726
- One thing I'm confused about.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.685
Where do you fit in
to all of this?

41:53.728 --> 41:56.992
- Well, Rupert recognized me.

41:57.036 --> 41:58.951
Oh, he's always disliked me.

41:58.994 --> 42:02.389
He's the one who cursed me
with the Tongue Twisters.

42:02.432 --> 42:04.739
No, I shall find
no happiness in Fillory

42:04.783 --> 42:05.958
so long as he's around.

42:06.001 --> 42:08.438
- So after you leave here,
what?

42:08.482 --> 42:10.049
Just gonna hit the streets?

42:10.092 --> 42:11.833
- Oh, hardly.

42:11.877 --> 42:14.401
I shall write.

42:14.444 --> 42:19.841
The things I have seen,
the stories I can tell.

42:19.885 --> 42:22.409
- His stories are very good.

42:22.452 --> 42:24.019
- Just not exactly
kid-appropriate.

42:26.718 --> 42:29.634
Oh, oh, oh, vexing.

42:29.677 --> 42:32.375
Oh, flattery flophouse.

42:33.986 --> 42:35.944
- Did you really
have to do that?

42:35.988 --> 42:37.772
He seemed like such a nice--

42:37.816 --> 42:38.773
- Pedophile?

42:38.817 --> 42:39.818
He's grooming you, Fen,

42:39.861 --> 42:41.080
because you act like you're 12.

42:41.123 --> 42:43.038
- Oh, Gods.

42:43.082 --> 42:45.998
- Remember, make sure to lock
on the right vibration.

42:51.090 --> 42:52.439
- Can you feel it?

42:52.482 --> 42:54.920
- Mm, it feels like home.

42:58.663 --> 42:59.664
- Here we go.

43:04.451 --> 43:06.932
Hi.

43:06.975 --> 43:09.761
- I think--I think--
I think we did it.

43:09.804 --> 43:11.632
Should I let go of your ha--

43:15.114 --> 43:17.899
- This--did you--

43:17.943 --> 43:21.511
- No, not on purpose.

43:21.555 --> 43:24.471
I do--I'm not sure
I even did this at all.

43:24.514 --> 43:25.733
- Whoa, why do I feel
like I've--

43:25.777 --> 43:27.561
- Been here before.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.824
Because this is it.

43:29.868 --> 43:32.566
This is where the signal
brought us.

43:32.610 --> 43:35.656
Okay, okay,
I'll just travel us out.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.049
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

43:40.226 --> 43:42.010
- Plum.
- It's not working.

43:43.795 --> 43:46.145
We can't leave.
