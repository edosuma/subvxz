Previously on
<i>"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:01.920 --> 00:04.470
<i>- It's a dragon egg.
- You're possessed.</i>

00:04.535 --> 00:06.351
Ray's gone.
I've taken over his body.

00:06.352 --> 00:07.640
<i>If Neron wanted John dead,</i>

00:07.720 --> 00:09.270
<i>he would have killed
him on the spot.</i>

00:09.350 --> 00:11.060
<i>I need you to open up
a doorway to hell.</i>

00:11.140 --> 00:13.618
<i>It's to bring someone here
from the other side.</i>

00:13.620 --> 00:14.480
<i>Tabitha.</i>

00:14.560 --> 00:17.040
I'm sorry. It wasn't me.
It was my nipple.

00:17.725 --> 00:20.065
Save me!
As you wish.

00:22.531 --> 00:23.445
I'm not leaving Mona behind.

00:23.525 --> 00:25.605
Do you really think
that everyone in hell

00:25.615 --> 00:26.825
deserves to be there?

00:26.826 --> 00:28.775
This is your opportunity
to make things right.

00:28.855 --> 00:30.875
I'm gonna save Ray.

00:31.905 --> 00:33.875
<i>Honey, time to go.</i>

00:35.075 --> 00:38.285
Come on, honey, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

00:38.365 --> 00:41.165
Zari? You better not
be eating the Halva.

00:41.245 --> 00:44.045
No, Mommy.

00:44.055 --> 00:47.045
Zari Jaan.

00:47.125 --> 00:49.725
Dessert's not for
after breakfast.

00:52.225 --> 00:53.885
What?

00:53.965 --> 00:57.185
It's only a kick.

00:59.065 --> 01:01.735
Behrad must be anxious
to meet you.

01:01.815 --> 01:04.405
Now go put your shoes on
so I can take you to school.

01:10.085 --> 01:12.405
<i>You might just want
to soak it all in.</i>

01:12.415 --> 01:15.245
<i>Violent people are pouring
into our country...</i>

01:15.255 --> 01:18.825
<i>Illegal immigrants,
terrorists, meta-humans.</i>

01:18.905 --> 01:20.535
<i>Politicians promise
to keep you safe</i>

01:20.615 --> 01:22.585
<i>but they've been
hiding the truth.</i>

01:22.595 --> 01:26.415
<i>There's a dangerous new threat
already within our borders.</i>

01:26.435 --> 01:28.675
<i>Hi, I'm Ray Palmer.</i>

01:28.745 --> 01:32.095
<i>Yes, that Ray Palmer...
Former CEO of PalmerTech.</i>

01:32.105 --> 01:33.595
<i>And I am here to warn you</i>

01:33.605 --> 01:35.175
<i>that creatures once thought only</i>

01:35.255 --> 01:37.935
<i>in legends and fairy tales
are real.</i>

01:41.015 --> 01:43.475
<i>Yes, folks, monsters are real,</i>

01:43.555 --> 01:44.855
<i>and they walk amongst us.</i>

01:44.935 --> 01:46.605
<i>And they will stop at nothing</i>

01:46.615 --> 01:48.905
<i>until they destroy humankind.</i>

01:48.975 --> 01:50.365
<i>Interested in learning more?</i>

01:50.435 --> 01:53.625
<i>Then join me at PalmerX 2019,</i>

01:53.695 --> 01:57.905
<i>where the power is in
the Palmer of your hands.</i>

02:01.155 --> 02:03.545
I don't care if Neron's
wearing my best friend's face.

02:03.615 --> 02:05.625
I want to punch him.
Get in line.

02:05.635 --> 02:08.125
Ogres are big softies... that
one wouldn't even hurt a fly.

02:08.134 --> 02:10.215
Neron's been a step
ahead of us for too long.

02:10.294 --> 02:12.475
We need to play offense.
Agreed.

02:12.555 --> 02:14.135
Sorry, what are we agreeing to?

02:14.145 --> 02:17.385
Look, it's time for us
to fight back.

02:17.465 --> 02:19.435
We're retaking the Bureau.

02:19.825 --> 02:24.735
<font color="#00FFFF">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#D81D1D">MaxPayne</font>
== <font color="#138CE9">https://</font>subscene<font color="#138CE9">.com</font> ==

02:24.765 --> 02:26.645
Gideon, pull up the blueprints
at the Bureau

02:26.655 --> 02:28.325
and start fabricating
and arsenal.

02:28.405 --> 02:30.115
<i>- Right away, Captain.</i>
- Look, Gary has bonded

02:30.195 --> 02:32.485
with the Fairy Godmother,
and while he might be an idiot,

02:32.495 --> 02:34.575
she is not to be underestimated.

02:34.645 --> 02:36.405
Mick, Nate, you think
you can handle Tabitha?

02:36.485 --> 02:38.365
- Granny's dead.
- Good.

02:38.445 --> 02:39.575
Ava and I will handle Neron.

02:39.655 --> 02:41.215
Yeah, I want a crack at him.

02:41.285 --> 02:43.005
It's my bureau he's running
his operation from.

02:43.085 --> 02:45.625
Not to be a buzzkill,
but even John and Nora

02:45.705 --> 02:47.175
couldn't out-magic Neron.

02:47.255 --> 02:49.845
- I just felt a kick.
- Oh, I want to feel!

02:49.925 --> 02:52.015
Right now the smart play would
be just to bide our time.

02:52.095 --> 02:53.635
Wait for John-o to return
with Ray's soul.

02:53.705 --> 02:55.175
Shockingly,
I agree with Charlie.

02:55.185 --> 02:56.765
I love you, little Wicksty...
Oh, I felt it!

02:56.835 --> 02:58.595
I told you, it's kicking.

02:58.675 --> 03:01.015
Okay, can you guys stop being
dragon-baby crazy right now?

03:01.025 --> 03:03.145
Look, this commercial is proof
that Neron

03:03.215 --> 03:04.645
is up to something big,
and we need

03:04.715 --> 03:06.975
to stop him
before it's too late.

03:07.055 --> 03:10.275
<i>Captain, I have an incoming
communication from Nora Darhk.</i>

03:10.355 --> 03:13.275
- Put her on.
<i>- Sara?</i>

03:13.285 --> 03:15.025
<i>Talk to me.
What's your status?</i>

03:16.525 --> 03:18.365
I'm tired of skulking
around air ducts.

03:18.375 --> 03:20.115
I'm going after Mona.

03:20.195 --> 03:21.615
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're gearing up

03:21.695 --> 03:23.375
for an assault.
Hold your position.

03:23.385 --> 03:26.205
- Hey!
- Too late.

03:26.285 --> 03:29.005
- Wait, where's Gary?
- In Ava's office...

03:29.075 --> 03:31.795
getting real comfortable.

03:31.875 --> 03:34.175
Mmm.

03:34.245 --> 03:36.635
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

03:38.005 --> 03:41.305
Yes, my pet?

03:41.385 --> 03:43.515
I want to dig deeper
on my next wish.

03:43.595 --> 03:46.055
Excellent idea.
What do you have in mind?

03:47.555 --> 03:48.815
Well...

03:48.885 --> 03:51.145
we've already redecorated
my office.

03:51.225 --> 03:52.525
I now have three nipples

03:52.605 --> 03:54.405
because a spare never hurts,
and...

03:54.485 --> 03:58.195
Perhaps you could make
a wish regarding the Legends?

03:58.275 --> 04:00.075
You want me to wish something
for them?

04:00.085 --> 04:02.875
I'm talking about revenge.

04:02.955 --> 04:04.865
- Oh.
- They lied to you, Gary.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.875
Promised you could be
an interim Legend.

04:07.945 --> 04:09.875
One wish, and you can send them

04:09.955 --> 04:14.015
all to hell
with John Constantine.

04:14.085 --> 04:15.935
Speaking of John,
you think he's all right?

04:16.005 --> 04:20.345
That warlock sent thousands
of demons to rot in the pits.

04:20.425 --> 04:25.265
I think he's well
and truly screwed, dearie.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:44.945 --> 04:47.035
Does this mean we're straight?

04:47.115 --> 04:49.035
I got a more important
collection to make.

04:52.095 --> 04:53.585
Who is that guy?

04:53.665 --> 04:56.425
That, my friend,
is John Constantine...

04:56.495 --> 04:57.975
in the flesh.

05:04.215 --> 05:06.265
Congratulations, Mona.

05:06.345 --> 05:08.985
I have selected you
for a very special assignment.

05:09.065 --> 05:10.605
That's okay, Ne-Ray.

05:10.675 --> 05:13.315
Can I call you that?
I'm okay here.

05:13.325 --> 05:16.735
You see, before Nate's father
decided he wanted to be

05:16.805 --> 05:18.775
P.T. Barnum,
we were working together.

05:18.855 --> 05:21.325
Training monsters
to do our bidding.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.945
Actually, I worked extensively

05:25.025 --> 05:26.745
with your dear friend Konane...

05:26.815 --> 05:30.335
I mean...
Your dead friend Konane.

05:37.875 --> 05:40.085
I found Mona.
Hurry.

05:41.895 --> 05:43.425
Copy that.

05:46.935 --> 05:49.065
This seems like overkill.

05:50.695 --> 05:54.315
The Legends never included me
in their pizza parties...

05:54.385 --> 05:57.775
or asked me to play
Dungeons & Dragons.

05:57.855 --> 06:00.315
Make them suffer, Gary.

06:00.395 --> 06:02.695
I can make them do
whatever you want.

06:02.705 --> 06:05.285
I just wanted to be
part of the team.

06:05.355 --> 06:07.655
As soon as Ava opens the portal,

06:07.735 --> 06:09.375
we go in firing.

06:09.455 --> 06:11.175
Time to burn some freaks.

06:12.345 --> 06:13.835
I wish...

06:13.905 --> 06:17.045
Opening a portal
in three, two, one.

06:19.745 --> 06:23.135
No.

06:29.735 --> 06:32.225
Welcome to book club.

06:35.615 --> 06:37.528
Why, you little...

06:37.529 --> 06:40.349
I'd be careful how you speak
to my charge.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.669
Gary, why are you doing this?

06:42.674 --> 06:45.674
Because I would like
to discuss...

06:45.754 --> 06:46.934
"The Collector."

06:47.014 --> 06:48.844
Forget the book, Gary.

06:48.854 --> 06:50.264
You helped a demon
take control of the Bureau.

06:50.274 --> 06:51.604
What happened to
the Bureau creed?

06:51.684 --> 06:53.724
Oh, I could ask
the same about you.

06:53.804 --> 06:56.064
Article 27?
Hmm?

06:56.074 --> 06:58.354
A supervisor must never show
favoritism?

06:58.434 --> 07:00.444
You started a book club
with another employee.

07:00.454 --> 07:04.444
Gary, Mona is being tortured
right now.

07:04.454 --> 07:06.074
Neron said he's trying
to protect

07:06.144 --> 07:07.624
humans from monsters.

07:07.704 --> 07:09.404
You saw Mona gnaw off my nip.

07:09.484 --> 07:12.074
- She did you a favor.
- Okay, um...

07:12.154 --> 07:14.704
maybe we should just reschedule

07:14.784 --> 07:17.304
until after we've read the book?

07:19.164 --> 07:20.804
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

07:20.884 --> 07:23.294
Oh, no.
Wait.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.344
- Ow.
- Book was terrible.

07:32.354 --> 07:34.144
Oh, my head.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.814
That's the spirit.

07:35.894 --> 07:38.144
<i>Sara, Ava, come in.
Where are you guys?</i>

07:38.154 --> 07:40.564
Hey, Nate.
Can't talk right now.

07:40.644 --> 07:42.314
Are you talking to Nate
on comms?

07:42.324 --> 07:45.064
Tell him I say hi.

07:45.144 --> 07:46.734
Gary says hi.

07:46.814 --> 07:49.284
And we are at book club.

07:49.354 --> 07:51.454
Move on to plan B.

07:51.524 --> 07:54.294
- What's plan B?
- I only listen for my name.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.784
I assume it's like plan A,

07:55.864 --> 07:57.914
but, you know, with less people.

07:57.994 --> 07:59.794
Well, without the Captain
and the clone,

07:59.864 --> 08:01.414
the Bureau's a suicide mission.

08:01.494 --> 08:02.924
Mick's right.

08:04.704 --> 08:06.184
We need to sneak into PalmerX,

08:06.254 --> 08:08.754
do some recon,
find out what Neron is up to.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.674
Now that sounds like a plan Z.

08:26.204 --> 08:29.154
- Mmm.
- Hey, baby.

08:29.234 --> 08:32.364
Hey, you looking
for a good time, handsome?

08:32.374 --> 08:34.044
I'm always looking
for a good time, love,

08:34.124 --> 08:37.124
but, uh, regrettably,
my time here is limited.

08:37.193 --> 08:39.044
Maybe you can help me.

08:39.124 --> 08:41.044
I'm looking for broker
in the soul trade.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.464
He goes by the name of Masher.

08:43.534 --> 08:46.174
I might know something.

08:46.244 --> 08:48.714
Well, this here is holy water.

08:48.724 --> 08:50.674
Now, you can use this
to burn the skin

08:50.754 --> 08:52.724
off any demon tosser
who messes with you.

08:52.804 --> 08:54.274
Uh-uh-uh.

08:55.754 --> 08:57.854
Masher likes to hang out
at the strip club

08:57.924 --> 09:00.064
after trading is done...

09:00.144 --> 09:01.984
John.

09:03.234 --> 09:05.064
How do you know my name?

09:05.074 --> 09:07.274
Oh, I know who you are.

09:07.354 --> 09:11.244
Half of demonkind is searching
for John Constantine.

09:12.824 --> 09:14.364
The holy water?

09:14.444 --> 09:17.254
Oh, this?
Nah, this is just whisky, love.

09:22.534 --> 09:24.164
Sure, our protagonist

09:24.244 --> 09:26.754
was keeping people
hostage, but...

09:26.834 --> 09:29.424
that's only because he never
received love as a child.

09:29.434 --> 09:31.394
Aah!

09:33.514 --> 09:36.184
They don't want you
in their book club, Gary.

09:36.254 --> 09:38.184
Doesn't that make you angry?

09:38.254 --> 09:41.224
Make a wish, and they will pay.

09:43.444 --> 09:45.944
You're right.
They don't want to spend time

09:46.024 --> 09:49.784
with Gary Green,
lowly Time Bureau agent.

09:49.864 --> 09:51.864
But they would love
to spend time

09:51.934 --> 09:54.744
with Gary Green...

09:54.814 --> 09:57.074
Captain of the Waverider!

10:05.634 --> 10:08.294
<i>Welcome aboard, Captain Green.</i>

10:14.054 --> 10:15.314
Thanks.

10:15.384 --> 10:17.724
I have no quarrel
with you, dear.

10:17.794 --> 10:19.484
You didn't send me to hell

10:19.554 --> 10:22.224
like John Constantine
and the Legends.

10:22.304 --> 10:23.484
Yes...

10:23.564 --> 10:27.894
I was in hell for 327 years.

10:27.974 --> 10:29.484
And what was my crime?

10:29.494 --> 10:32.614
I sprinkled a little magic
over Salem,

10:32.684 --> 10:34.444
trying to help a girl
who's mother

10:34.524 --> 10:36.164
was accused of witchcraft.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.704
Okay, well, you're out now.

10:38.774 --> 10:40.294
Why help Neron?

10:41.584 --> 10:44.714
Neron rescued me in hell.

10:46.494 --> 10:48.414
What can I say?

10:48.494 --> 10:50.674
True love bloomed.

10:50.684 --> 10:55.014
I know what you're thinking...
He's so much older than me.

10:56.374 --> 11:00.974
Sometimes you
have to look past age.

11:01.054 --> 11:03.854
You know, in another life,

11:03.864 --> 11:07.324
I think you and I could have
been friends.

11:08.564 --> 11:10.774
Toodles.
Wait, wha...

11:15.204 --> 11:17.284
Ray?

11:17.354 --> 11:19.664
Without all
of the idiotic tendencies.

11:22.954 --> 11:26.094
Make a move on me,
and Mona dies.

11:28.914 --> 11:30.214
Ray is good and strong.

11:30.224 --> 11:32.004
He can fight his way
back from hell.

11:32.084 --> 11:34.894
Who do you think
is having a worse time in hell?

11:34.964 --> 11:36.934
Ray, or your father?

11:38.394 --> 11:40.734
Turns out Daddy dearest
isn't so tough.

11:40.804 --> 11:43.904
I hear Damien Darhk is going
stark raving mad in the pits.

11:43.974 --> 11:45.474
Why am I here?

11:45.554 --> 11:49.024
Well, you and John
tried to kill me... nearly did.

11:49.094 --> 11:51.354
If the doofus
in the skin suit I'm wearing

11:51.434 --> 11:53.694
hadn't have interrupted,
I'd have been obliterated.

11:53.764 --> 11:55.744
I spent many nights
just dreaming

11:55.824 --> 11:57.234
about how I was going
to get my revenge.

11:57.244 --> 11:59.324
And then it came to me...
What better punishment

11:59.404 --> 12:01.864
than making you sit front row

12:01.944 --> 12:03.534
to all of the fear and rage

12:03.614 --> 12:05.034
I'm about to unleash
on the Earth,

12:05.114 --> 12:07.094
all while in the body
of the man you love.

12:09.094 --> 12:10.834
Now...

12:12.764 --> 12:15.264
Smile for the cameras.

12:15.344 --> 12:17.464
- Mr. Palmer!
- Are monsters real?

12:17.544 --> 12:19.174
What's tonight all about?

12:19.254 --> 12:22.554
Now, all of your questions
will be answered soon.

12:27.774 --> 12:30.114
- Oh. Excuse me.
- What's wrong with you?

12:30.184 --> 12:31.354
Well, you know,
a room full of people

12:31.434 --> 12:32.944
fearful of magical creatures

12:33.024 --> 12:34.774
just makes me a little bit
fearful, all right?

12:34.784 --> 12:38.904
The worst part is,
Ray loves tech events.

12:41.364 --> 12:43.374
Good evening, D.C.,
and welcome

12:43.454 --> 12:45.704
to PalmerX 2019.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.754
Now, you're all
probably wondering,

12:51.824 --> 12:54.794
what in the heck is Ray Palmer
doing back in the public eye?

12:54.804 --> 12:58.214
Well, folks, for the past
two years I have been hunting

12:58.294 --> 12:59.594
magical creatures.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.474
Hang with me here.

13:03.544 --> 13:06.554
I have created an exosuit
capable of combating

13:06.634 --> 13:09.104
the most ferocious
of their kind.

13:09.174 --> 13:10.604
What a douche.

13:10.674 --> 13:13.234
But I can't do it alone.
I need your help.

13:13.304 --> 13:15.644
I need you to help me
find these creatures...

13:15.664 --> 13:19.164
Creatures that may be hiding
right here amongst us.

13:19.234 --> 13:22.904
Now, everyone take out
your smartphones.

13:22.984 --> 13:24.574
Better be PalmerTech.

13:24.654 --> 13:27.914
I have created a small,
simple app,

13:27.984 --> 13:29.674
that will change the world.

13:29.744 --> 13:32.244
And I want you all
to download it right now.

13:32.324 --> 13:34.084
The app is called Eyes.

13:34.164 --> 13:37.754
Now, on Eyes, you will be able
to share real-time,

13:37.834 --> 13:39.794
life-saving monster sightings.

13:39.874 --> 13:43.634
Share them, and I will be there
to save you.

13:43.714 --> 13:46.134
Remember, the power

13:46.214 --> 13:48.694
is in the Palmer of your hands.

13:48.764 --> 13:52.264
You really expect us
to believe monsters exist?

13:52.344 --> 13:54.694
I thought you were going
to offer us proof.

13:54.774 --> 13:56.984
Thank you, Cindy.
You are absolutely right.

13:57.054 --> 13:59.104
Here is your proof.

13:59.184 --> 14:02.034
Now, this may look like
a helpless hipster

14:02.114 --> 14:03.694
who should be working
at a bookstore,

14:03.704 --> 14:06.154
but believe me, she is something

14:06.234 --> 14:08.614
altogether more dangerous.

14:29.344 --> 14:31.064
- Masher.
- John?

14:31.074 --> 14:32.434
Yeah, yeah, all right,
keep your hair on.

14:32.514 --> 14:34.154
No need to tell the whole
bloody club.

14:34.234 --> 14:35.994
Oh, buddy, now I know you're
out of your mind.

14:36.064 --> 14:38.654
What are you doing in hell?
I'm here to save a friend.

14:38.664 --> 14:40.994
His soul belongs to Neron.

14:41.074 --> 14:43.114
Cheers, love.
He's paying.

14:43.194 --> 14:46.004
Nobody gets into Neron's
soul vault without his say-so.

14:46.074 --> 14:48.004
Except the Triumvirate,
and I have a plan

14:48.074 --> 14:49.454
to deal with them,
but first, there's a hunch

14:49.534 --> 14:50.664
I need to confirm.

14:50.674 --> 14:52.994
What's Neron trading at?

14:53.004 --> 14:55.584
He's steady, but I'll let you
in on a little secret.

14:55.664 --> 14:57.754
His stock is about to rise.

14:57.834 --> 15:00.424
I'm talking a massive
soul collection on Earth.

15:00.494 --> 15:01.634
You know what that means?

15:01.704 --> 15:03.254
Neron is finally making his play

15:03.334 --> 15:04.844
for the throne of hell.

15:04.854 --> 15:06.764
Oh, cheers, Masher.
I can use that.

15:06.834 --> 15:08.184
Be careful, John.

15:08.194 --> 15:10.144
Not every demon
you've sent to hell

15:10.214 --> 15:11.934
is as forgiving as I am.

15:12.014 --> 15:13.894
Yeah, don't I know it.

15:25.734 --> 15:27.124
You're dead, demon hunter.

15:28.524 --> 15:30.614
I was going to be
a demon proctologist,

15:30.694 --> 15:32.284
but the pay wasn't as good.

15:37.954 --> 15:40.224
- Hold him.
- Oh!

15:40.294 --> 15:43.174
Oh, Calibraxis.
Hey, looking good, mate.

15:43.254 --> 15:45.964
You grow your beard?
John Constantine.

15:46.044 --> 15:49.014
I'm really going to enjoy
watching you breathe your last.

15:49.084 --> 15:50.974
I invoke a parlay.

15:51.054 --> 15:53.184
I demand to speak
to the Triumvirate.

15:53.264 --> 15:55.354
I'm a demon, not a pirate, John.

15:55.424 --> 15:56.894
I thought you understood
the rules.

15:56.904 --> 15:59.184
Well, you little maggot,

15:59.264 --> 16:00.644
as long as I'm alive,

16:00.724 --> 16:02.614
then the Triumvirate
can pass me around

16:02.684 --> 16:04.694
like a little sparrow
amongst the cats.

16:04.774 --> 16:08.034
But as soon as I die,
you dim-witted dick,

16:08.104 --> 16:10.084
then my soul belongs to Neron,

16:10.164 --> 16:11.584
and then the Triumvirate
lose out

16:11.664 --> 16:13.174
on all the tasty little bits
of torture

16:13.244 --> 16:14.414
that they've got planned for me.

16:14.424 --> 16:16.084
So you've got two choices:

16:16.094 --> 16:17.794
You can either kill me

16:17.804 --> 16:20.214
and royally piss off the old
bags that run this place,

16:20.284 --> 16:23.504
or take me to speak
with the Triumvirate.

16:28.964 --> 16:31.384
<i>I'm detecting
a fugitive alert... stop it...</i>

16:31.464 --> 16:33.224
<i>At the Inquisition,
Captain Green.</i>

16:33.304 --> 16:35.434
Oh, I don't do torture.

16:35.444 --> 16:38.114
- Could've fooled me.
- Hey. Play nice.

16:38.184 --> 16:39.604
We have to distract Gary

16:39.614 --> 16:42.234
while the B team
is plan B... ing.

16:42.304 --> 16:44.404
<i>Would a fairy at the
Great British Bakeoff</i>

16:44.474 --> 16:45.524
<i>suit your fancy?</i>

16:45.604 --> 16:47.614
Shall we, uh...

16:47.624 --> 16:49.904
keep calm and pastry on?

16:49.984 --> 16:53.164
<i>I'll plot a course, Captain.</i>

16:53.234 --> 16:55.244
Get it?

16:55.254 --> 16:56.624
"Keep calm and pastry on"?

16:56.634 --> 16:59.054
Good one, Cap.

16:59.124 --> 17:01.294
- Hilarious.
- Thanks, guys.

17:01.374 --> 17:02.794
Thanks.
Yeah.

17:02.804 --> 17:06.794
Take a good,
long look at her... Mona Wu.

17:06.804 --> 17:09.644
You saw her on the street,
you wouldn't think twice.

17:09.723 --> 17:11.384
Come on, Mona.
Don't give him what he wants.

17:11.394 --> 17:14.934
But she has a strange
and violent condition...

17:15.003 --> 17:16.763
brought about
when she fell in love

17:16.844 --> 17:18.894
with a repulsive creature.

17:18.973 --> 17:20.894
I feel like a bridge scene
should have more people.

17:20.973 --> 17:24.824
Oh, no, we love
three-people bridge scenes.

17:24.904 --> 17:26.733
Yeah, otherwise we just
end up standing around all day.

17:26.814 --> 17:28.944
Oh, that's why
Mick's always grumpy.

17:28.954 --> 17:30.484
Come on, Mona.

17:30.504 --> 17:32.784
I promised
these fine people a show.

17:32.864 --> 17:34.414
Let's not keep them waiting.

17:37.194 --> 17:40.804
Shift now or end up
dead like Konane.

17:59.934 --> 18:01.354
Folks, proof

18:01.434 --> 18:04.524
of the world's
very first werewolf.

18:14.564 --> 18:17.284
That's what we're missing...
The boys!

18:17.364 --> 18:19.004
- No.
- Yeah.

18:26.224 --> 18:28.634
Fairy Godmother?

18:32.714 --> 18:34.054
- Z.
- B.

18:35.924 --> 18:38.394
- She made him disappear!
- Well, well, well...

18:38.464 --> 18:39.944
what do we have here?

18:40.014 --> 18:41.764
More magic in the audience?

18:41.844 --> 18:44.814
She's one of them!

18:44.894 --> 18:47.614
He's right.
I am.

18:50.144 --> 18:53.444
She's a witch.
Witch. Witch.

18:53.454 --> 18:56.254
Witch, witch, witch!

18:56.324 --> 18:57.824
Witch, witch...

18:57.904 --> 18:59.494
Don't worry, folks.
The witch won't get far.

18:59.574 --> 19:02.244
Not as long as everyone
downloads the Eyes app.

19:02.254 --> 19:05.164
Share your sightings.
We'll find the witch.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.834
It's only a matter of time.

19:15.944 --> 19:17.974
Sara, you guys okay?

19:18.054 --> 19:21.474
Yeah, we're fine, as long
as we keep placating Gary.

19:21.554 --> 19:24.224
I guess Charlie and Z
are our last hope.

19:24.304 --> 19:27.194
- Great, we're toast.
- Welcome to hell.

19:27.264 --> 19:30.194
Good evening,
this is your captain speaking.

19:32.614 --> 19:34.034
Just...

19:34.104 --> 19:35.494
What?

19:35.504 --> 19:37.494
We'll be cruising at
a high altitude

19:37.564 --> 19:40.044
on our way
to save a bakeoff in Britain.

19:40.124 --> 19:42.034
- Whoo, yeah.
- Yeah.

19:42.054 --> 19:43.624
Gary, is that
the Kid Steel costume?

19:43.704 --> 19:45.504
Uh-huh.

19:45.574 --> 19:46.964
You like-y?

19:47.034 --> 19:49.804
Why would anyone wish
to be a sidekick?

19:49.884 --> 19:52.344
- Close your legs.
- Oh, he's such an idiot.

19:52.414 --> 19:54.554
What?

19:54.564 --> 19:56.844
Nothing,
they're just teasing you.

19:56.924 --> 19:59.934
- Oh.
- You're my Gar-bear.

20:00.004 --> 20:01.904
We're gonna have so much fun.

20:04.354 --> 20:06.354
Okay?

20:06.434 --> 20:08.244
#EyesApp is trending on Twitter

20:08.314 --> 20:11.654
below Kanye's surprise album
and a cat getting a bath.

20:11.724 --> 20:13.914
Mm.
How many downloads?

20:13.984 --> 20:17.154
Only 2,000, Mr. Palmer.

20:17.234 --> 20:18.744
News cycle is so fast
these days,

20:18.754 --> 20:20.664
it's hard to
cut through all the noise.

20:20.734 --> 20:22.534
But a monster attack
on the capital

20:22.614 --> 20:24.914
will dominate
the headlines for weeks.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.304
And then what?

20:26.374 --> 20:28.754
More people will download
some app?

20:28.764 --> 20:31.514
That's your big plan?

20:31.594 --> 20:33.844
Why, yes, it is.

20:33.914 --> 20:35.424
Ah! My love.

20:35.434 --> 20:38.094
Would you please
escort our guest

20:38.104 --> 20:39.434
to a cell?

20:39.444 --> 20:41.264
Let's go, dearie.

20:46.554 --> 20:50.694
Neron didn't say which
containment cell to put you in.

20:50.764 --> 20:52.404
Why are you helping me?

20:52.474 --> 20:54.734
Because you're a fellow witch,

20:54.814 --> 20:56.954
and I think
we can help each other.

21:01.614 --> 21:03.704
Mona?

21:03.784 --> 21:05.084
How do you feel?

21:05.154 --> 21:07.134
I've been better.

21:07.204 --> 21:11.254
Remember, I'm just
a "Fairy Godmother" away.

21:16.084 --> 21:20.554
Trust me, we'll be safe here.

21:23.894 --> 21:26.144
Where are we?

21:26.154 --> 21:27.814
My childhood home.

21:27.824 --> 21:30.394
I thought you grew up
in a dystopian city, Z.

21:30.474 --> 21:32.194
You had a pool?

21:32.204 --> 21:34.234
In a couple years,
A.R.G.U.S. will use people's

21:34.314 --> 21:37.574
growing fear of meta-humans
to seize control.

21:37.644 --> 21:40.494
Of course, it didn't help
that we were Muslim.

21:40.504 --> 21:43.664
We were forced to move
to a ghetto district in 2021.

21:43.674 --> 21:45.504
Humans are so easy
to manipulate.

21:45.584 --> 21:47.504
I mean, you just show them
a scary ogre

21:47.584 --> 21:50.844
or a dangerous meta,
they just go barmy.

21:50.924 --> 21:53.834
Haven't even been able
to get into the Eyes app yet

21:53.914 --> 21:55.464
because the terms
of service are so long.

21:55.544 --> 21:57.174
No one bothers reading those.

21:57.184 --> 21:59.134
It's a demon app.
I'm gonna read the fine print.

21:59.214 --> 22:00.674
I can't believe
it's just us left.

22:00.684 --> 22:02.014
I mean, you and I both knew
from the start

22:02.084 --> 22:04.144
that it was madness
to storm the Bureau.

22:04.224 --> 22:07.144
- Oh, my God.
- What?

22:07.214 --> 22:08.264
Z?

22:08.344 --> 22:09.904
In New Orleans,

22:09.984 --> 22:13.104
John said Neron needed more
souls to take over hell.

22:13.184 --> 22:14.694
Here it says in exchange
for the service,

22:14.704 --> 22:16.614
the user agrees to forfeit
their eternal soul

22:16.684 --> 22:17.814
to the demon Neron.

22:17.894 --> 22:19.154
What, you're saying that anyone

22:19.234 --> 22:21.114
who downloads the app
is going to hell?

22:21.194 --> 22:22.114
Yeah.

22:22.194 --> 22:24.374
Oh, that is mental.

22:24.454 --> 22:28.534
This little fairy was causing
quite the fray

22:28.544 --> 22:30.544
around the soufflé.

22:30.624 --> 22:32.254
I think I know

22:32.324 --> 22:34.464
just the place for you, madame.

22:34.534 --> 22:36.384
I can't take it anymore.

22:38.084 --> 22:39.724
I'm gonna kill him.

22:39.804 --> 22:42.464
Hey, Z, Charlie, please tell
me you have something.

22:42.544 --> 22:45.934
Well, we figured out Neron's
app is a way to collect souls.

22:46.004 --> 22:48.304
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, it gets crazier.

22:48.384 --> 22:50.404
To drum up fear and increase
downloads of his app,

22:50.474 --> 22:52.814
we think he may be planning
a monster attack.

22:52.884 --> 22:54.904
Okay, well, we'll stall Gary,

22:54.984 --> 22:57.024
but you got to get every single
one of those monsters

22:57.104 --> 22:58.404
out of the Time Bureau.

22:58.414 --> 23:00.984
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

23:01.064 --> 23:03.784
- Who are you talking to, Sara?
- What?

23:03.854 --> 23:06.914
Gary! Baby, bubby, bubelah.

23:06.924 --> 23:10.374
There's a whole big
world of problems.

23:10.444 --> 23:12.494
You know, Neron
and your Fairy Godmother,

23:12.574 --> 23:14.504
they're not really
your friends, but...

23:14.574 --> 23:16.544
Do you know
who your friends are?

23:16.554 --> 23:19.004
These guys.

23:19.084 --> 23:20.504
Huh?

23:20.584 --> 23:21.924
Are you trying to schmooze me?

23:21.934 --> 23:23.264
Feels good, right?

23:23.274 --> 23:25.424
Uh, actually,
it feels a little false.

23:25.434 --> 23:29.184
Gary!
You are our friend.

23:29.254 --> 23:31.854
I mean, would we lie
to an interim Legend?

23:31.924 --> 23:33.274
Ah, you see, that's just it,

23:33.354 --> 23:35.444
because I'm not
an interim Legend.

23:35.524 --> 23:37.154
You just promised me that
to use me as bait.

23:37.234 --> 23:38.694
- Pfft.
- You know what, Gary?

23:38.764 --> 23:40.064
It's a little hard to feel
sorry for you

23:40.144 --> 23:41.694
when you're holding us
all hostage.

23:41.774 --> 23:43.154
You're not getting it.

23:43.164 --> 23:45.034
This whole time,
Tabitha has been trying

23:45.104 --> 23:47.544
to use me to hurt you.

23:47.624 --> 23:50.784
All I wished
was for us to hang out.

23:50.794 --> 23:53.464
I was trying to protect you.

23:53.544 --> 23:56.204
I get it.
I'm not cool.

23:56.284 --> 23:58.874
But I don't deserve
to be treated like a joke.

23:58.954 --> 24:01.084
So, now...

24:01.164 --> 24:03.554
now the joke's on you.

24:03.624 --> 24:06.314
- What's he talking about?
- Oh, Fairy Godmother!

24:07.634 --> 24:10.144
Yes, my pet?

24:10.224 --> 24:12.104
Mick thinks he's a tough guy,

24:12.174 --> 24:14.944
but I think he's a big baby.

24:21.574 --> 24:25.574
And Nate, who's never been
bullied a day in his life,

24:25.644 --> 24:28.244
welcome to my high-school years.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.744
And, Sara and Ava,

24:35.764 --> 24:38.004
the cool girl
and the class president,

24:38.014 --> 24:40.674
you know what I want you
to do for me?

24:40.684 --> 24:42.514
Dance!

24:45.014 --> 24:47.014
Five, six, seven, eight.

24:51.524 --> 24:54.304
Faster!

24:54.324 --> 24:56.524
Gary, stop it!

24:58.694 --> 25:00.484
Faster!

25:07.234 --> 25:08.494
Charlie,
I get that you're scared,

25:08.564 --> 25:10.114
but the team is counting on us.

25:10.194 --> 25:11.704
I'm not scared. It's just,
breaking the monsters

25:11.714 --> 25:13.624
out of the prison
is a multiple-person job.

25:13.694 --> 25:16.164
- You can be multiple people.
- Look, Z, yeah, I can,

25:16.244 --> 25:17.334
for a second, and you know what?

25:17.404 --> 25:18.624
It takes its toll.

25:18.704 --> 25:20.004
Now, I could end up
back in prison

25:20.014 --> 25:22.174
or even worse, dead.

25:22.244 --> 25:23.884
When A.R.G.U.S.
came for my family,

25:23.964 --> 25:25.844
my brother,
Behrad, told me to run.

25:25.914 --> 25:28.134
And I did.

25:28.214 --> 25:31.134
I've never forgiven myself.

25:31.214 --> 25:32.764
You won't either.

25:32.844 --> 25:34.804
We can't change
my family's future,

25:34.884 --> 25:37.234
but we can save their present.

25:37.314 --> 25:38.894
Zari Jaan, make sure

25:38.904 --> 25:40.564
you take your shoes off
before you go in.

25:40.644 --> 25:42.984
- I know.
- Charlie?

25:43.054 --> 25:45.654
If I die, I'm gonna come back
and haunt you.

25:45.724 --> 25:49.154
I would love a ghost friend.

25:49.234 --> 25:50.574
Come on.

26:05.594 --> 26:06.674
Cool.

26:18.424 --> 26:22.444
Greetings, Satan,
first of the fallen.

26:22.524 --> 26:24.944
It's been a long time, John.

26:24.954 --> 26:26.404
Belial.

26:26.474 --> 26:27.734
We've been looking forward

26:27.814 --> 26:30.694
to hearing the bunk
you're pedaling.

26:30.774 --> 26:32.954
And Beelzebub.

26:33.034 --> 26:36.284
Not as popular, but you were
always my personal favorite.

26:36.294 --> 26:38.414
This is a waste of our time.

26:38.494 --> 26:41.504
I take it you've noticed
a certain demon's stock

26:41.584 --> 26:43.084
has been on the rise.

26:43.164 --> 26:45.974
Neron's been doing
very well for himself.

26:46.044 --> 26:48.424
Neron is trying to take
control of hell.

26:48.504 --> 26:49.924
And let me assure you,

26:50.004 --> 26:52.144
his method for collecting souls,

26:52.224 --> 26:55.134
it won't be to sign
on the dotted line in blood.

26:55.144 --> 26:57.594
He's, uh, young,

26:57.674 --> 26:59.654
by your standards at least.

26:59.724 --> 27:03.484
And let's just say,
he means to disrupt the system.

27:03.494 --> 27:06.154
If we interfere with Neron,
we'll look weak.

27:06.234 --> 27:09.234
Well, that's precisely
where I come in, Bubby.

27:09.314 --> 27:13.114
And what do you want
in exchange?

27:13.194 --> 27:15.914
Not your own soul, I hope.

27:15.994 --> 27:19.834
I'm here for the soul
of Raymond Palmer.

27:19.904 --> 27:22.414
You let us two leave hell,
and I pledge to you

27:22.494 --> 27:25.464
that I will dedicate all
of my crafty, wicked ways

27:25.534 --> 27:28.584
to thwarting Neron
and securing your reign.

27:28.594 --> 27:30.754
Are you really here

27:30.834 --> 27:33.134
for Raymond Palmer?

27:41.174 --> 27:43.194
We thought there was another...

27:45.264 --> 27:49.314
A young girl whose life
you destroyed.

27:49.394 --> 27:50.864
Astra.

27:55.404 --> 27:59.534
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want to be too greedy.

27:59.544 --> 28:01.704
But, yeah, I'll take them both.

28:01.714 --> 28:03.374
Both of them?

28:03.384 --> 28:06.204
That is greedy.

28:06.224 --> 28:08.624
But if you were to choose,

28:08.704 --> 28:11.264
well, then
that's a different matter.

28:13.004 --> 28:16.394
John, help me.

28:17.734 --> 28:21.394
John, you're here. You got
to get me back to Earth.

28:23.814 --> 28:26.894
Please, John.
They're hurting me.

28:26.974 --> 28:29.574
Make up your mind, John.

28:29.654 --> 28:31.904
This offer won't last.

28:34.604 --> 28:35.914
John?

28:35.994 --> 28:37.954
- Astra?
- It's following me!

28:38.034 --> 28:38.994
Make it go away!

28:42.734 --> 28:44.784
Come here, I've got you.

28:44.864 --> 28:46.004
You can't have her!

28:46.084 --> 28:48.594
You can't save her.

28:48.674 --> 28:50.834
You can't have her!
You can't have her!

28:50.914 --> 28:52.804
John, get me out of here!

29:00.794 --> 29:03.184
I'm sorry.

29:03.254 --> 29:06.394
I choose...

29:06.474 --> 29:08.404
Astra Logue.

29:14.064 --> 29:16.654
Stick to the plan, Charlie.

29:16.734 --> 29:18.534
You mean the plan
where I need to rely

29:18.544 --> 29:20.614
on my shoddy shape-shifting
to portal creatures one by one

29:20.694 --> 29:22.374
out of their cells
and on to the Waverider,

29:22.384 --> 29:25.414
where Gary may or may not
wish them to Kingdom Come?

29:25.424 --> 29:27.874
Yep, that plan.

29:31.784 --> 29:33.894
This isn't you, Gary.

29:33.964 --> 29:36.604
Why are you being so cruel?

29:36.674 --> 29:38.344
Please!

29:38.424 --> 29:40.394
Stop! You're killing them!

29:42.934 --> 29:44.904
I don't do mime, dearie.

29:44.974 --> 29:47.144
Just stop!
Everything!

29:47.224 --> 29:49.484
As you wish...

29:52.314 --> 29:53.734
- Ooh.
- Ugh.

29:56.414 --> 29:57.574
Huh.

29:57.644 --> 29:59.914
Mona?
Hey, wake up.

30:02.064 --> 30:03.874
Hey, Nora.

30:03.944 --> 30:06.084
Hey.

30:06.094 --> 30:07.874
Oh, you're still here.

30:07.954 --> 30:10.914
I'm book club forever.

30:10.994 --> 30:12.674
Book club forever.

30:23.604 --> 30:26.654
Oh, Fairy Godmother!

30:26.724 --> 30:29.524
Uh, I have to pop off

30:29.534 --> 30:32.064
for a second, Gary.

30:32.144 --> 30:34.784
I thought we were going to
play Settlers of Catan later.

30:34.864 --> 30:36.944
Don't be silly.

30:36.954 --> 30:40.074
We're not friends.

30:40.144 --> 30:42.334
Oh.

30:43.504 --> 30:46.534
I am so sorry, Gary.

30:46.614 --> 30:47.914
I took you for granted.

30:47.994 --> 30:50.124
I never,
ever should have let you

30:50.134 --> 30:53.084
do my dry cleaning
or work overtime without pay.

30:53.164 --> 30:54.964
I mean, that's illegal anyway.

30:54.974 --> 30:56.304
I'm so sorry.

30:56.384 --> 30:58.044
I still want to kill you.

30:58.124 --> 31:01.464
Gary, when Rip first
recruited the Legends,

31:01.484 --> 31:04.224
he picked the people
that were insignificant

31:04.294 --> 31:07.054
to history...
The original losers.

31:07.134 --> 31:10.144
You don't have to be cool
to be a Legend.

31:10.154 --> 31:13.494
And maybe we forgot that
somewhere along the way, but...

31:13.564 --> 31:16.274
you are one of us.
Now, come on, Gary.

31:16.354 --> 31:18.164
Ray and Constantine are both
stuck in hell,

31:18.234 --> 31:19.734
and you can help them.

31:19.814 --> 31:22.784
Just use your Fairy Godmother
powers for good.

31:26.984 --> 31:28.874
Save her.

31:28.944 --> 31:32.584
Sadly, my hands are tied.

31:32.594 --> 31:36.464
But if you become Mona's
Fairy Godmother,

31:36.534 --> 31:39.344
she could wish to be healed.

31:39.414 --> 31:41.804
How do I do that?

31:41.814 --> 31:44.674
If another witch
takes the wand...

31:46.764 --> 31:49.934
You'll take my curse...

31:50.014 --> 31:53.684
but with it, all of my power.

31:53.694 --> 31:54.684
Nora.

32:00.374 --> 32:02.784
Nora, no.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.494
No...

32:08.404 --> 32:10.544
Oh, it worked.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.714
Quick, Mona.
Make a wish.

32:12.794 --> 32:14.054
Wow.

32:14.124 --> 32:15.874
Uh, Fairy God-Nora,

32:15.884 --> 32:19.634
I wish to be safe
on the Waverider.

32:22.544 --> 32:26.724
Oh, how I've missed me.

32:26.734 --> 32:28.514
Sadly for you,

32:28.594 --> 32:32.064
when you took on the wand's
power and responsibility,

32:32.144 --> 32:34.684
you also took on its charge.

32:34.764 --> 32:37.564
- Gary?
- I'm afraid so.

32:38.974 --> 32:41.574
Fairy Godmothers are prisoners.

32:41.654 --> 32:45.244
Their magic is dependent
on whiny humans

32:45.324 --> 32:48.034
and their petty demands.

32:48.114 --> 32:49.574
You lied.

32:49.584 --> 32:52.084
Obviously.

32:53.114 --> 32:54.874
Toodles.

33:06.604 --> 33:09.224
Excuse me.

33:09.294 --> 33:13.474
- Oh. Marilyn Monroe?
- Why, yes.

33:13.554 --> 33:15.894
I seem to have
gotten a little lost.

33:15.974 --> 33:18.024
Can you help me get back home?

33:18.094 --> 33:20.734
Of course, ma'am.

33:20.814 --> 33:23.524
Let me just program in a year.

33:28.714 --> 33:32.114
- Ah. Yeah.
- Uh...

33:37.544 --> 33:38.464
Thank you, sir.

33:38.544 --> 33:40.794
Oh, my love!
My love.

33:42.474 --> 33:44.464
Uh, still no luck with Nora?

33:44.474 --> 33:46.214
- No.
- Oh.

33:46.294 --> 33:48.304
Well, she'll take
your curse soon.

33:48.314 --> 33:50.974
After all,
you are very convincing.

33:51.044 --> 33:52.804
Well, I better head back.

33:52.814 --> 33:55.224
Evil deeds to do and all that.

33:59.474 --> 34:02.494
No.

34:06.854 --> 34:08.994
Well, that was bloody close.

34:10.244 --> 34:12.914
<i>I'm at the first cell.
Anytime now, Z.</i>

34:12.984 --> 34:15.254
Okay, just give me one second.

34:16.494 --> 34:19.454
The public doesn't always
know what's best for them.

34:19.534 --> 34:22.083
So tonight we will release
the Minotaur

34:22.164 --> 34:25.134
and scare them into accepting
our protection.

34:25.204 --> 34:28.014
It is done,<i> mon amour.</i>

34:28.094 --> 34:29.684
How do I look?

34:30.714 --> 34:33.304
But you were just...

34:33.384 --> 34:35.094
Oh, the shape-shifter.

34:37.684 --> 34:41.274
Can someone sound the alarm?

34:44.684 --> 34:47.074
Charlie, Tabitha and Neron
are onto you.

34:47.154 --> 34:48.614
Yeah, I figured.

34:48.684 --> 34:50.574
You need to get out now.

34:50.643 --> 34:53.543
Open all the doors,
turn off the force fields.

34:53.614 --> 34:55.373
I'm not leaving.

35:20.264 --> 35:22.144
Are you waiting
for an invitation?

35:22.224 --> 35:24.074
It's a bloody jailbreak!

35:29.119 --> 35:31.619
I mean, there are pros
to trusting your apologies

35:31.629 --> 35:33.739
are sincere, and cons.

35:33.819 --> 35:35.909
Maybe I'll make a list.

35:35.989 --> 35:38.709
Gary...
Gary, just go with your heart.

35:41.329 --> 35:43.139
Oh, Fairy Godmother!

35:44.959 --> 35:46.589
- Nora.
- Oh...

35:46.669 --> 35:49.679
Go find John and help him
rescue Ray from hell.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.139
Oh, fiddlesticks.

35:51.219 --> 35:52.979
- Wait, wait!
- Gary!

35:53.059 --> 35:54.649
Gary, you dick!

35:56.729 --> 35:58.229
Oh.

35:59.899 --> 36:01.269
Come on, you lot.
Get a move on.

36:01.349 --> 36:02.899
You don't have to tell me twice.

36:02.969 --> 36:04.899
Faster, sassy!

36:08.559 --> 36:09.989
You're all right, little one.

36:09.999 --> 36:12.109
Oi, ogre.
Catch!

36:16.819 --> 36:18.499
Charlie, you're out of time.

36:18.569 --> 36:21.669
Z, get out of here.
See you on the other side.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.919
<i>I'm going after Mona.</i>

36:30.929 --> 36:32.509
Mona.

36:35.169 --> 36:36.929
Come on, my love.

36:37.009 --> 36:39.349
Let's get you out of here.

36:41.359 --> 36:44.229
Ugh. I hate shape-shifters.
Break her neck.

36:44.309 --> 36:46.569
Patience,<i> mon amour.</i>

36:48.449 --> 36:50.149
Get Mona.

36:50.229 --> 36:52.279
No!

36:54.729 --> 36:58.329
Looks like things ain't going
so well for you, Neron.

36:58.399 --> 37:01.119
You wanted a monster
to attack D.C.

37:01.199 --> 37:05.039
Now we have
every single monster...

37:05.049 --> 37:06.719
in one.

37:12.079 --> 37:14.059
You promised me
you'd take me to see Astra.

37:14.139 --> 37:16.389
Patience, John.

37:16.459 --> 37:19.219
I made a pledge to you,
and I expect you

37:19.229 --> 37:21.179
to keep your end of the bargain.

37:27.079 --> 37:29.689
What the hell
are you playing at?

37:29.769 --> 37:31.489
John?

37:31.559 --> 37:35.319
John, is it really you?

37:35.399 --> 37:37.489
Yes.
Yes, Astra, love.

37:37.569 --> 37:39.989
It's me.
It's me. This is Johnny.

37:40.069 --> 37:42.169
Thank God...

37:44.589 --> 37:48.669
God? You know better
than to thank Him.

37:51.619 --> 37:53.379
Astra?

37:53.459 --> 37:55.969
John is here to take you
back to Earth.

37:56.049 --> 37:59.219
You're welcome to go.

37:59.299 --> 38:02.559
Yeah. It's all right, love.
It's me.

38:05.189 --> 38:06.779
No.

38:09.139 --> 38:10.769
Wait.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.779
Hold on.

38:12.789 --> 38:14.289
What do you mean no?

38:14.359 --> 38:17.239
Looks like the deal
is null and void.

38:17.319 --> 38:21.199
Neron is a thorn
in our side, John,

38:21.279 --> 38:23.299
but torturing you...

38:23.369 --> 38:25.049
is too much fun.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.919
<i>John?</i>

38:28.989 --> 38:30.879
<i>It's following me.</i>

38:30.949 --> 38:32.379
<i>Make it go away!</i>

38:32.459 --> 38:34.089
<i>Please!</i>

38:34.169 --> 38:36.469
<i>John, het me out of here!</i>

38:47.159 --> 38:49.149
Astra, love.

38:49.159 --> 38:52.979
This isn't you.
Oh, of course it is.

38:52.989 --> 38:56.649
Or would you rather I stayed
that terrified little girl,

38:56.659 --> 39:00.659
crying and waiting
for you to come and rescue me?

39:00.669 --> 39:03.839
I would have been waiting
a long time.

39:03.909 --> 39:06.999
I am so, so sorry, love, but...

39:07.009 --> 39:09.459
this place, it's twisted you.

39:09.539 --> 39:11.669
If anything...

39:11.679 --> 39:14.009
it's made me more like you.

39:14.089 --> 39:15.349
Right, John?

39:15.419 --> 39:17.969
You're not like me.

39:18.039 --> 39:20.689
You're not.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.929
You chose wrong.

39:24.009 --> 39:25.969
You should have saved
your friend.

39:46.029 --> 39:49.459
Hey, watch it!
Back off, freak!

39:49.529 --> 39:51.629
It's like a demented Noah's Ark.

39:51.699 --> 39:53.379
What about Charlie?

39:53.389 --> 39:55.049
It's my fault.
I'm the one that convinced her

39:55.129 --> 39:56.219
to risk everything.

39:56.299 --> 39:57.879
Hey, don't go down that road.

39:57.889 --> 39:59.259
We'll do what we always do.

39:59.329 --> 40:02.059
Yeah, forming stupid Beebos.

40:04.839 --> 40:07.229
Hey, where are you going?

40:07.309 --> 40:09.239
Well, after everything,
I just figured

40:09.309 --> 40:11.309
you wouldn't want to
have me around anymore.

40:11.389 --> 40:13.019
It's all hands on deck, Gary.

40:13.099 --> 40:14.569
Yeah.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.659
We're gonna need all our
friends to defeat Neron.

40:18.849 --> 40:20.819
Aye, aye.

40:20.899 --> 40:22.739
You all right?

40:22.749 --> 40:24.629
Not really.

40:26.569 --> 40:28.419
I'm glad you
and Wicksty are okay.

40:31.949 --> 40:33.249
What happened?

40:33.259 --> 40:35.339
Oh, my God.

40:52.469 --> 40:54.109
Hi.

40:54.189 --> 40:56.739
My name is Zari.
