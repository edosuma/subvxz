00:02.001 --> 00:03.711
Previously on Lost:

00:03.796 --> 00:05.672
I'm going to win this race, Pen.

00:05.756 --> 00:08.007
And in a year, I'll be back.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.721
Boat.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.562
You.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.024
This camp Michael is leading you to,

00:25.109 --> 00:27.276
that is where they will set their trap.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.947
While Michael leads you by land,
I can approach far more quickly by sea.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.368
They gave me a list.

00:35.452 --> 00:40.248
I had to bring all four of you back,
or they said I'd never see my son again.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.585
Tomorrow, we're gonna
find out what happens

00:44.670 --> 00:47.547
if that button doesn't get pushed.

00:54.638 --> 00:57.181
- Neat trick.
- John!

00:57.266 --> 00:58.391
John!

00:58.475 --> 01:00.268
John has locked me out of the hatch.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.354
He did this because he is going
to stop pushing that button.

01:03.439 --> 01:06.357
I am absolutely certain
that if he is successful,

01:06.442 --> 01:09.569
in 90 minutes
everyone on this island will die.

01:13.449 --> 01:15.742
- Wait. Please.
- Wait, Hurley showed me.

01:15.826 --> 01:19.412
It's around here somewhere.
It's definitely... around...

01:19.496 --> 01:21.581
It's...

01:21.665 --> 01:24.500
- We're running out of time, Charlie.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.502
Here it is!

01:28.255 --> 01:31.716
Told you. Be careful. Be careful.

01:31.842 --> 01:35.470
Dynamite is very unstable.
You don't wanna end up like Dr. Arzt.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.187
Careful.

01:44.313 --> 01:48.357
Eko. Hey! Eko.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.402
Listen.

01:51.487 --> 01:56.783
What if we hurt them?
Or blow up the computer?

01:56.867 --> 01:58.326
You can leave now, Charlie.

02:01.747 --> 02:05.291
John? It's Charlie.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.335
Let's work this thing out, John.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.756
John! Eko is very upset, John.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.759
Let's just open this door,
and we can talk about it.

02:16.428 --> 02:20.139
John, you should know Eko
is gonna blow open the blast door.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.183
Blow it open with what?

02:22.267 --> 02:25.061
With dynamite from the old ship
in the jungle!

02:26.230 --> 02:29.732
It would take an atom bomb, brother.
Tell him not to bother.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.235
You're sure it'll hold?

02:32.319 --> 02:36.948
Aye. I'm sure.

02:45.707 --> 02:49.502
Six. Five. Four.

02:49.586 --> 02:53.256
Three. Two. One.

03:07.896 --> 03:11.691
How do you even remember
where you left off from?

03:11.775 --> 03:16.529
Slowly, Des. Very, very slowly.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.372
You should've seen Radzinsky do this.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.625
He had a photographic memory.
This whole baby was his idea.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.919
Yeah, right, Radzinsky.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.338
Radzinsky figured out
how to fake a lockdown.

03:34.423 --> 03:38.384
Radzinsky created
this great invisible map.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.887
More and more tales
about your former partner,

03:40.971 --> 03:44.891
yet for some reason you never want
to tell me what bloody well happened.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.817
See that brown stain there?

03:56.653 --> 03:58.821
That's Radzinsky.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.785
He put a shotgun in his mouth
when I was asleep.

04:06.580 --> 04:11.000
The bitch of it was I only had 108
minutes to bury the poor bastard.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.760
Well, if you don't want me to go crazy,

04:20.844 --> 04:23.554
next time let me go out.

04:23.639 --> 04:27.433
Oh, you want to go out there
with the quarantine and the hostiles?

04:27.517 --> 04:30.561
I haven't been outside
for two bloody years!

04:30.646 --> 04:32.897
I want to go! I was in the army,
for God's sake!

04:32.981 --> 04:36.609
Oh, right. Her Majesty's Army, correct?

04:36.693 --> 04:41.197
Tell me, Desmond, why did you leave
that nice old lady's army?

04:41.281 --> 04:45.910
Oh, I remember now. You got kicked out
because you couldn't follow orders.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.204
And why did you leave your army,
Kelvin, huh?

04:50.082 --> 04:53.709
Because men followed my orders.

04:53.794 --> 04:57.421
But then, thank God,
I joined the Dharma Initiative.

04:57.506 --> 05:01.258
"Namaste, thank you, and good luck."

05:03.887 --> 05:05.721
Please, Kelvin.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.477
Let me go out. Just once.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.775
Sorry, Des. You stay here.

05:17.859 --> 05:22.071
You push the button. That's an order.

05:26.952 --> 05:31.747
John! Look, seriously,
you're about to be detonated!

05:39.297 --> 05:43.092
Hey. What if John's right?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.761
Maybe it's just some colossal joke.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.348
You know, it's just
some old computer connected to nothing.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.976
Maybe it's just a bunch of wires that...

06:00.777 --> 06:02.486
Is that a joke?

06:06.950 --> 06:09.285
I'll see myself out.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.961
John!

06:19.046 --> 06:21.797
This is your last chance to end this.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.301
Open the door, and I will forgive you.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.471
Forgive me for what?

06:35.979 --> 06:37.980
Hey.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.942
Hey, Eko? Wait.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.278
Just wait a second.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.822
I don't...
I don't think it's a good idea, Eko.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.950
We're in a very confined area.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.249
Oh, bollocks.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.911
Kelvin!

07:34.913 --> 07:36.914
Hey, Kelvin!

08:12.367 --> 08:18.038
I couldn't do it.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.214
What is this?

08:27.299 --> 08:30.467
This is the only other way out, partner.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.511
- What are you talking about?
- Fail-safe.

08:33.597 --> 08:37.600
Just turn this key,
and this all goes away.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.148
What's behind that wall, Kelvin?

08:46.943 --> 08:48.194
What was the incident?

08:49.279 --> 08:53.657
Electromagnetism. Geologically unique.

08:53.742 --> 08:57.912
The incident? It was a leak.

08:57.996 --> 09:01.916
So now the charge builds up
and every time we push the button,

09:02.000 --> 09:07.004
it discharges it.
Before it gets too big.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.594
Why make us do it? Push the button?

09:13.678 --> 09:14.762
If we can just...

09:14.846 --> 09:18.766
Here's the real question, Desmondo:

09:18.850 --> 09:23.896
Do you have the courage
to take your finger out of the dam,

09:23.980 --> 09:26.649
blow the whole thing up instead?

09:31.947 --> 09:34.782
I think your friends
just blew themselves up, brother.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.201
Maybe we should open it.

09:37.327 --> 09:41.205
No! No. It's a trick.

09:41.289 --> 09:45.125
A trick? They could be hurt.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.502
Is your doctor around?

09:49.673 --> 09:54.176
- Can I ask you a question, brother?
- Absolutely.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.014
Is the reason
you're letting that clock there

09:59.099 --> 10:03.269
run all the way down
to the very last tick...

10:03.353 --> 10:06.939
Is it because you need
to look down the barrel of a gun...

10:07.023 --> 10:09.483
...and find out
what you really believe, John?

10:11.027 --> 10:15.698
I looked down the barrel of the gun.
And I believed.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.409
I thought...

10:19.703 --> 10:24.957
...it was my destiny
to get into this... place.

10:25.041 --> 10:28.961
And somebody died. A kid.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.798
Because he was stupid enough to believe
that I knew what I was talking about.

10:32.882 --> 10:36.135
And on the night he died for nothing,

10:36.219 --> 10:40.264
I was sitting right up there all alone,

10:40.348 --> 10:45.311
beating my hand bloody
against that... stupid door.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.898
Screaming to the heavens,
asking what should I do.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.234
And then a light went on.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.405
I thought it was a sign.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.202
But it wasn't a sign.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.582
Probably just you going to the bathroom.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.347
Jack.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.785
What are they?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.344
It's handwritten.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.638
And it's all filled. The whole book.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.807
They're journal entries.

13:31.352 --> 13:35.147
"0400. S.R. moves
Ping-Pong table again.

13:35.231 --> 13:39.151
0415. Takes a shower." What is this?

13:39.235 --> 13:41.111
Hey, doc?

13:41.196 --> 13:45.115
What'd you say Sayid's sign was when the
coast was clear to hit that beach party?

13:47.619 --> 13:49.661
That means he found them, right?

13:49.746 --> 13:51.663
That's miles from here.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.338
- Where were you taking us?
- What?

13:59.422 --> 14:02.508
Sayid said he'd light the signal
so we'd meet him at the shore.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.801
- Why aren't we going to the beach?
- We are.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.970
- We're nowhere near the beach!
- I had to.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.180
- What?
- I...

14:21.778 --> 14:23.153
Sawyer!

14:28.535 --> 14:31.036
Run! Go! Go!

14:32.789 --> 14:34.706
Hold on. Wait!

15:13.997 --> 15:18.750
Tell me about this other hatch
you found. This... Pearl.

15:18.835 --> 15:23.130
The Pearl is a psychological
station full of TV monitors.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.799
And two men sat in viewing chairs

15:25.883 --> 15:29.845
and filled notebooks with observations
on what happens in here.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.764
And then they put
the notebooks in pneumatic tubes

15:32.849 --> 15:35.934
that sent them to their
headquarters so they could evaluate us

15:36.019 --> 15:37.853
as an experiment.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.028
What?

15:47.030 --> 15:49.990
- What if you've got it backwards?
- Backwards?

15:50.074 --> 15:53.952
What if the experiment wasn't on the two
men here, but on the two men in there?

15:54.037 --> 15:56.121
- I want to see that tape.
- No, you can't.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.206
There's no way to see it down here.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.126
Was there anything else
in that station? A computer?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.378
- Yeah.
- So, what did it do?

16:03.463 --> 16:07.215
Nothing! It didn't do anything.
It printed out numbers. Lots of numbers.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.675
- Where is it?
- Here.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.971
Reading material for the next
19 minutes. Knock yourself out.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.573
You've been shaving every day
for the last three years.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.535
You need to live a little. Let go.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.412
I'm never gonna let go, brother.

16:40.041 --> 16:43.752
Oh, that's the spirit. Goodbye, Des.

16:47.882 --> 16:48.924
Goodbye?

16:51.386 --> 16:56.223
Yeah. Goodbye.
See you in a couple hours.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.540
Well, gosh. I didn't think
you had the stones to come after me.

18:48.419 --> 18:51.421
I was a spook for ten years.
I know when I'm being followed.

18:51.506 --> 18:54.925
- What are you doing with my boat?
- I'm fixing it.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.594
You were leaving?

18:57.678 --> 19:00.388
Well, I mean, not yet.
She's still about a week away.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.390
You wrecked her pretty good, Des.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.645
So, what do you think?
Want to come with me?

19:07.855 --> 19:09.981
Come where?

19:10.066 --> 19:11.399
What about the button?

19:12.735 --> 19:16.655
Screw the button, man.
Who knows if it's even real?

19:16.739 --> 19:19.741
That's not what you said when
you were going on about dams

19:19.826 --> 19:23.703
- and electromagnetics and fail-safes!
- Well, I was drunk.

19:23.788 --> 19:24.996
Why did you lie to me?

19:25.081 --> 19:29.167
I lied to you because I needed
a sucker to save the world after I left.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.878
- You're crazy! You bastard!
- Come on.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.840
You stole my life!
What else did you lie to me about?

19:34.924 --> 19:36.758
- What else? Tell me!
- Easy.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.349
How could you do this to me?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.559
Get up.

19:52.066 --> 19:56.444
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:22.430 --> 20:26.099
Failure. System failure.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.477
System failure. System failure.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.496
What are you doing?

21:32.917 --> 21:35.710
- When did you come here?
- What?

21:37.380 --> 21:40.966
The island. When did you come here?
How long ago?

21:41.050 --> 21:43.677
- Sixty, 65 days.
- The date! What was the date?

21:43.761 --> 21:44.970
September 22nd.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.684
It was September 22nd.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.568
I think I crashed your plane.

22:31.392 --> 22:33.018
Hey!

22:33.102 --> 22:35.311
Everybody just calm down!

22:37.690 --> 22:38.982
It's fake.

22:39.942 --> 22:43.737
- We know that your beard is fake.
- Sorry, missy. I didn't get you.

22:43.821 --> 22:46.489
She says she knows
your beard's fake, Tom.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.618
Well, thanks
for pointing that out, Kate.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.079
I can't tell you
how much this thing itches.

22:53.164 --> 22:56.458
And thanks
for telling them my name, Bea.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.840
Hello, again.

23:54.517 --> 23:55.892
Where's your beard?

23:57.186 --> 23:58.686
I think they know.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.739
All right.
Let's take care of business.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.481
Eko?

24:44.400 --> 24:45.733
Eko.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.409
It's Charlie. Wake up!

24:58.581 --> 25:00.915
- We need to push the button.
- No, we don't.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.293
Did you not hear me?
I crashed your plane.

25:03.377 --> 25:04.752
How did you manage to do that?

25:04.837 --> 25:07.422
That day, those numbers
turned to hieroglyphics.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.341
When the last one came down,
this place started to shake.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.802
That screen filled up
with "system failure."

25:12.887 --> 25:14.971
"System failure." And that number there:

25:15.097 --> 25:20.351
92204. September the 22nd, 2004.
The day your plane crashed. It's real!

25:20.436 --> 25:22.812
It's all bloody real!
Now push the damn button!

25:22.897 --> 25:26.941
I know what I saw!
It's a lie! It's not real!

25:27.026 --> 25:28.776
None of it is real!

25:28.861 --> 25:31.154
You don't want to push the button?
Then I will.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.614
No!

25:45.336 --> 25:47.295
You've killed us.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.923
You've killed us all.

25:50.007 --> 25:54.469
No. I just saved us all.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.692
Hey! Eko! Wake up.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.654
Hey! Hey!

26:12.738 --> 26:14.739
Can I get some help? Can you help me?

26:14.823 --> 26:16.908
I'm trying, brother!

27:06.333 --> 27:08.876
Dearest Des.

27:08.961 --> 27:12.213
I'm writing this letter
to you as you leave for prison.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.799
And I've hidden it
in the one place you would turn to

27:14.883 --> 27:18.136
in a moment of great desperation.

27:18.220 --> 27:22.098
I know you go away with the weight
of what happened on your shoulders.

27:22.182 --> 27:25.601
And I know the only person
who can ever take it off is you.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.106
Please don't give up, Des.

27:30.190 --> 27:34.944
Because all we really need to survive
is one person who truly loves us.

27:35.863 --> 27:38.197
And you have her.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.616
I will wait for you always.

27:40.701 --> 27:43.911
I love you, Pen.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.345
It's all gone!

28:08.270 --> 28:11.689
It's all...! It's all gone!

28:11.774 --> 28:14.400
It's all... It's all gone.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.987
All gone!

28:40.302 --> 28:43.054
This was supposed to work!

28:51.688 --> 28:53.940
You weren't...

28:55.484 --> 28:59.987
I've done everything you wanted me
to do, so why did you do this?

29:00.072 --> 29:01.989
Why?

29:42.948 --> 29:46.492
Three days before you came down here,
before we met,

29:46.577 --> 29:48.911
I heard a banging on the hatch door,
shouting.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.456
But it was you, John, wasn't it?

29:51.540 --> 29:54.292
You say there isn't any purpose?
No such thing as fate?

29:54.376 --> 29:57.503
But you saved my life, brother.
So that I could save yours.

29:57.588 --> 30:00.131
Don't! No! No! None of this is real!

30:00.215 --> 30:03.384
Nothing is gonna happen!
We're gonna be OK!

30:03.886 --> 30:07.388
I've got to go, and you've got to get
as far away from here as possible.

30:07.473 --> 30:11.058
- Go where? Stop!
- I'm gonna blow the dam, John.

30:12.686 --> 30:16.063
I'm sorry for whatever happened
that made you stop believing.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.857
But it's all real.

30:19.693 --> 30:22.612
And now I've got to go
and make it all go away.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.280
Wait! Desmond?

30:25.866 --> 30:28.201
I'll see you in another life, brother.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.790
System failure. System failure.

30:35.334 --> 30:39.921
Eko! Eko! Wake up!

30:40.297 --> 30:43.758
Can you move? Hey, come on.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.470
You all right?

31:24.049 --> 31:25.299
Oh, my God!

31:27.052 --> 31:29.178
- Come on! Come with me!
- Charlie.

31:29.263 --> 31:33.683
- No! Hang on!
- Get out of here! Go!

31:35.936 --> 31:37.478
Eko!

31:44.611 --> 31:45.695
John!

32:04.006 --> 32:05.756
I was wrong.

32:27.404 --> 32:32.199
All we really need to survive
is one person who truly loves us.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.368
And you have her.

32:34.453 --> 32:38.873
I will wait for you always.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.209
I love you.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.546
I love you, Penny.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.092
Charlie!

34:17.304 --> 34:18.806
You OK?

34:18.889 --> 34:21.434
It's... it's hard to tell exactly,
Bernard.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.811
My ears... You know?

34:23.895 --> 34:26.313
Where's Locke? Eko?

34:26.398 --> 34:29.692
- They're not back yet?
- No.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.748
I'm not happy about the arrangement
that was made with you,

34:44.833 --> 34:48.085
but we got more than we bargained for
when Walt joined us.

34:48.170 --> 34:51.589
So I suppose this is what's best.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.842
And you let me go. Set me free.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.679
You lived up to your word.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.518
We live up to our word too.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.939
- You know how to drive a boat?
- I can drive a boat.

35:09.024 --> 35:13.402
Good. You're gonna take this boat
and follow a compass bearing of 325.

35:13.487 --> 35:18.282
And if you do that exactly,
you and your son will find rescue.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.659
What, that's it?

35:20.744 --> 35:23.454
I follow the bearing,
and me and my son get rescued?

35:23.538 --> 35:25.039
Yes.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.543
How do you know I won't tell people
about where I was?

35:31.421 --> 35:34.965
Maybe you will, and maybe you won't.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.509
But it won't matter.

35:36.593 --> 35:40.262
Once you leave,
you'll never be able to get back here.

35:40.347 --> 35:43.724
And my hunch is you
won't say a word to anybody.

35:43.809 --> 35:48.312
Because if you do, people will find out
what you did to get your son back.

35:54.236 --> 35:57.905
My friends.
I was promised you wouldn't hurt them.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.991
A deal's a deal.

36:05.580 --> 36:08.082
Who are you people?

36:09.960 --> 36:12.127
We're the good guys, Michael.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.054
All right. She's all yours.

36:22.556 --> 36:25.015
What? What, am I stupid?
Where is my son?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.184
Walt's inside.

36:31.273 --> 36:32.857
Walt?!

36:34.276 --> 36:36.110
Bon voyage, Michael.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.241
Walt!

36:42.325 --> 36:44.451
Dad! Dad!

36:44.536 --> 36:47.079
Come here. Come here.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.461
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK. I'm OK.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.547
OK. I got you now.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.049
It's gonna be OK, now.
We're going home, Walt.

36:59.134 --> 37:01.218
We are going home.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.704
Hugo, you can go back to your camp.

37:30.749 --> 37:31.999
What?

37:33.168 --> 37:35.169
Go back.

37:35.253 --> 37:40.132
Your job is to tell the rest of
your people they can never come here.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.177
But what about my friends?

37:45.680 --> 37:47.932
Your friends are coming home with us.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.981
Go.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.789
What happened out there, Charlie?

39:36.833 --> 39:39.585
You want to hear the part
about me nearly being killed

39:39.669 --> 39:43.338
by the flaming fire ball
or the flying fork?

39:43.423 --> 39:46.300
I want you to be serious.

39:48.178 --> 39:50.220
Nothing happened.

39:50.847 --> 39:52.973
Well, something happened.

39:53.058 --> 39:57.102
I mean, that noise, and the sky
turned that weird violet color.

39:57.187 --> 39:59.104
Did it?

42:13.114 --> 42:15.282
- Hello?
- Ms. Widmore?

42:15.366 --> 42:17.326
- Yes?
- It's us.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.663
I think we found it.
