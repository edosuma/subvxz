WEBVTT

00:01.551 --> 00:02.917
He's my producer.

00:02.952 --> 00:04.719
You want to talk to me,
you go through him.

00:04.754 --> 00:07.021
Nice work. I guess that means
you're my new Number Two.

00:07.057 --> 00:08.956
You're smart. You're articulate.

00:08.992 --> 00:10.692
I mean, you've got it all.

00:10.727 --> 00:12.527
Where did that come from?

00:12.562 --> 00:15.096
You know I have major daddy issues.

00:15.131 --> 00:17.131
I think I may be
falling in love with you.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.507
And I want children.

00:20.070 --> 00:21.636
You had your chance, and you blew it.

00:21.671 --> 00:23.104
You're done.

00:23.139 --> 00:24.572
They're blaming the whole
shooting on you?

00:24.607 --> 00:26.240
They blew up your career.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.275
So, why do you care?

00:27.310 --> 00:28.710
Because I'm a reporter.

00:28.745 --> 00:30.311
That woman Mary who jumped off the roof

00:30.347 --> 00:31.913
last year... that was a murder.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.414
- Who's your source?
- Jeremy.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.449
I've got him on tape.

00:34.484 --> 00:35.616
You want to work together?

00:35.652 --> 00:37.118
This piece will be unstoppable.

00:37.153 --> 00:39.487
I need you to walk us
through it, step by step.

00:39.522 --> 00:41.289
We lied. We covered it up,

00:41.324 --> 00:43.324
and they should have just arrested us,

00:43.393 --> 00:44.559
'cause we killed her.

00:44.594 --> 00:46.094
I-I need to tell you something.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.495
This is not about the show.

00:47.530 --> 00:49.430
It's about me and my
mom... That I was raped

00:49.466 --> 00:51.165
by one of her patients
at her house when I was 12.

00:51.201 --> 00:52.433
And she blamed me

00:52.469 --> 00:54.268
because she was protecting her practice.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.371
Come here.

00:56.406 --> 00:58.840
I'm so sorry.

01:01.010 --> 01:02.577
That's the truth.

01:02.612 --> 01:06.614
No matter what anybody else
says, we killed her.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.250
And also Quinn.

01:09.285 --> 01:10.418
I mean, she's the one that told me

01:10.453 --> 01:11.986
not to say anything, you know,

01:12.021 --> 01:13.988
because everybody's always
trying to shut me up.

01:15.692 --> 01:17.592
...no, but you know that
I didn't even know about it.

01:17.627 --> 01:19.193
That's the truth.

01:19.229 --> 01:20.495
Oh, yeah.

01:20.530 --> 01:21.529
We call the cops, like, all the time.

01:21.564 --> 01:22.764
Call the cops?

01:22.799 --> 01:23.831
Yeah, we call them all the time.

01:24.968 --> 01:26.168
Quinn... I mean, she's the one

01:26.202 --> 01:27.301
that told me not to say anything,

01:27.337 --> 01:28.703
and so I listened to her,

01:28.738 --> 01:30.838
because she told me not to tell anybody.

01:30.874 --> 01:32.507
Yeah, wow.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.509
We should have called the police
a lot sooner with Mary.

01:34.544 --> 01:35.710
Hey.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.446
- Hey.
- What is that?

01:38.481 --> 01:39.847
What are you doing?

01:39.883 --> 01:43.184
Um... this is our story.

01:43.219 --> 01:44.452
It's not the car pullover

01:44.487 --> 01:46.220
or what the cops did, none of that.

01:46.256 --> 01:49.323
It's this. "Everlasting."

01:49.359 --> 01:50.825
The whole despicable culture...

01:50.860 --> 01:52.393
the deceit, the lies,
back-stabbing, and cover-ups.

01:52.429 --> 01:53.828
No. I-I... Coleman,

01:53.863 --> 01:55.530
I shouldn't have said any of this stuff.

01:55.565 --> 01:57.732
Oh, my gosh. Rachel... No, you had to,

01:57.767 --> 01:59.167
because you're a good person,
and... I... Listen, we have to erase this.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.535
There's no erasing this, Rachel.

02:00.570 --> 02:01.702
- I need...
- This isn't going anywhere.

02:01.738 --> 02:03.037
I-I'm not gonna do that.

02:03.072 --> 02:04.338
I'm not gonna, like, take down the show.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.640
- I'm not doing that to Quinn.
- Rachel.

02:05.675 --> 02:06.808
No way. How do we do this?

02:06.843 --> 02:08.042
Oh, my gosh. "To Quinn."

02:08.077 --> 02:09.676
How do I... Um, how do I erase this?

02:09.711 --> 02:11.646
It just amazes me how she
just plays you, Rachel.

02:11.681 --> 02:13.001
I guess after meeting your mother,

02:13.016 --> 02:14.248
I shouldn't be so surprised at this.

02:14.284 --> 02:15.716
What do you mean by meeting my mother?

02:15.752 --> 02:18.920
I didn't mean...
I'm saying Quinn is smart.

02:18.955 --> 02:21.222
- Mm-hmm.
- And she pretends to care about you,

02:21.257 --> 02:22.990
just a little bit here and there

02:23.026 --> 02:25.526
just 'cause she knows you
need it, because you're human.

02:25.562 --> 02:29.597
Rachel, what would she do if
she actually cared about you?

02:29.632 --> 02:32.400
She'd have you get the
hell out of this place,

02:32.435 --> 02:33.901
because it's killing you.

02:33.937 --> 02:35.336
Quinn is killing you.

02:35.371 --> 02:37.705
You said it yourself right there...

02:37.740 --> 02:39.674
all roads lead back to her.

02:39.709 --> 02:40.942
We have to expose her for who she is.

02:40.977 --> 02:42.415
I just really don't think

02:42.419 --> 02:44.245
- that we need to do anything, actually.
- I disagree.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.047
Coleman, it just feels
like you're concerned

02:46.082 --> 02:47.069
about your career, which

02:47.094 --> 02:48.015
- I understand...
- I am.

02:48.051 --> 02:50.211
But I'm here to tell you that
you will get another job.

02:50.220 --> 02:51.111
- This is...
- No, Rachel,

02:51.136 --> 02:52.286
you couldn't be more right.

02:52.322 --> 02:53.955
I am so concerned about my career,

02:53.990 --> 02:54.790
because all this crazy shit...

02:54.793 --> 02:56.301
She's gonna try and pin it

02:56.326 --> 02:57.925
- on me, everything.
- Mm-hmm.

02:57.961 --> 03:00.061
But she's gonna try
to pin it on you, too.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.599
You don't see that? Oh, my gosh.

03:04.634 --> 03:07.101
They killed someone, so they'll
say you were crazy,

03:07.136 --> 03:08.870
you were in a mental institution,

03:08.905 --> 03:10.238
they'll say whatever...

03:10.273 --> 03:11.906
They'll do whatever they have to do.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.407
It's up to you,

03:13.443 --> 03:17.044
but we need evidence to take Quinn down.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.313
It's your decision. You have to choose.

03:19.349 --> 03:21.082
Is it gonna be you or Quinn?

03:21.117 --> 03:25.086
If it's you, then you need
to get back in with Quinn.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.808
Well, here we are.

03:47.844 --> 03:49.677
I don't need to tell you what it means

03:49.712 --> 03:51.612
to have made it down to the Final Three.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.949
Today Darius is gonna take
each of you out on a date

03:54.984 --> 03:58.185
that he has chosen especially for you.

03:58.221 --> 04:02.323
The stakes... could not be higher.

04:02.358 --> 04:03.758
All right, that's a cut! Moving on.

04:03.793 --> 04:05.159
- That's a cut.
- One take, that's it?

04:05.194 --> 04:06.594
- Graham.
- "The stakes"...

04:06.629 --> 04:07.862
You go save the girls from that nympho.

04:07.897 --> 04:08.996
"The stakes could not be higher."

04:09.032 --> 04:10.164
I'd rather shoot myself.

04:10.199 --> 04:11.332
Hey, I need to talk to you.

04:11.367 --> 04:12.867
What's up, Big Money?

04:12.902 --> 04:15.202
Listen, um, I know I'm supposed
to pick Tiffany,

04:15.238 --> 04:17.271
- but I'm...
- No, no, no. Stop. Stop.

04:17.307 --> 04:19.373
Don't think of it as "picking" Tiffany,

04:19.409 --> 04:21.208
think of it as securing a future

04:21.244 --> 04:22.877
for yourself with her father.

04:22.912 --> 04:24.445
Pretty amazing future

04:24.480 --> 04:25.947
considering football's
not really an option.

04:25.982 --> 04:27.481
Jay! Shh! Damn it!

04:27.517 --> 04:29.283
I get that, okay? You
don't think I get that?

04:29.319 --> 04:31.385
Tell the world, why don't you.

04:31.421 --> 04:33.487
Look, I'm not humiliating Chantal

04:33.523 --> 04:35.957
on national television.
I'm not doing it.

04:35.992 --> 04:38.459
It won't happen, okay?
She's a sweet girl.

04:38.494 --> 04:39.961
She doesn't deserve that.

04:39.996 --> 04:41.829
Okay, but Yael does?

04:41.864 --> 04:43.998
Yael can handle herself.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.534
Look, black women all over
America are going to hate me

04:46.569 --> 04:48.035
if I cut Chantal for Tiffany.

04:48.071 --> 04:49.403
Ah, well look at you

04:49.439 --> 04:51.205
for finally jumping on the race train.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.008
Jay, seriously... Look, make
this happen for me, okay?

04:54.043 --> 04:55.977
Get Chantal to drop out
and make it her own idea.

04:57.347 --> 04:59.513
That way at least somebody
can leave here

04:59.549 --> 05:00.715
with some dignity.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.651
Okay. I got you. I got this.

05:03.686 --> 05:07.421
I'm fine, really, all good. Thanks.

05:13.071 --> 05:15.047
It's all on here.

05:15.169 --> 05:16.364
Jeremy just let loose about everything.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.598
He's so pissed at them.

05:19.435 --> 05:21.235
They're murderers, and they
kicked me off the set?

05:21.270 --> 05:23.104
Who do they think they are?

05:23.139 --> 05:25.106
T-they can't just
do whatever they want...

05:25.141 --> 05:26.907
- This is great stuff.
- So what next?

05:26.943 --> 05:28.075
You just win "Everlasting."

05:28.111 --> 05:29.610
Your editor was right...

05:29.646 --> 05:31.078
an exposé coming from
this season's winner...

05:31.114 --> 05:32.246
That's gonna blow things up.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.217
Well done.

05:38.321 --> 05:40.521
Hey! So, um...

05:40.556 --> 05:43.891
any tips for getting Darius interested?

05:43.926 --> 05:46.060
Trust me, he's interested.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.395
Oh, yeah?

05:47.430 --> 05:50.398
When is he gonna start to show it?

05:50.433 --> 05:53.067
You know I'm with Rachel, right?

05:59.042 --> 06:00.875
Sure, you are.

06:03.813 --> 06:05.246
Oh, God.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.583
Till next time.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.322
Oh, come on.

06:15.358 --> 06:17.658
I thought that went rather swimmingly.

06:17.694 --> 06:18.893
'Cause you didn't have a cattle prod

06:18.928 --> 06:20.094
shoved up your vagina.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.662
Ah, but you took it like a champ.

06:21.698 --> 06:23.397
- Mm.
- Now we just wait for Dr. Gupta

06:23.433 --> 06:25.499
to look over the ultrasound
and get back to us.

06:25.535 --> 06:29.170
It's concierge care.
We'll have results in 24 hours.

06:29.205 --> 06:30.905
You know, I'm just surprised

06:30.940 --> 06:33.574
that she didn't
laugh me out of her office.

06:33.609 --> 06:35.810
We've talked about this before.
Age is just a number.

06:35.845 --> 06:37.445
Remember... I'm a workaholic, okay?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.846
And I love being a workaholic,

06:38.881 --> 06:40.815
and that is a recipe
for raising a stripper.

06:40.850 --> 06:43.918
Nope. Strippers... absent father. Next?

06:45.250 --> 06:47.655
Okay, what if our kid's a raging dick?

06:47.690 --> 06:48.989
Nannies' problem.

06:49.025 --> 06:50.858
Neglect that... We'll move to the next.

06:50.893 --> 06:52.193
Ugh...

06:52.228 --> 06:54.929
Look... My car's almost here.

06:54.964 --> 06:56.263
Mm.

06:56.299 --> 06:58.432
Well, get to it, my little workaholic.

06:58.468 --> 06:59.800
- Mm.
- Mwah.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.802
Just make sure to keep
that womb warm and dry.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.337
Ew.

07:03.372 --> 07:04.638
- Cozy? I'm new at this.
- Stop, okay?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.040
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. See you.

07:06.075 --> 07:07.475
What?!

07:07.510 --> 07:09.777
You never seen anyone kiss before?

07:16.652 --> 07:20.287
What are you doing here?

07:20.323 --> 07:22.056
You, uh, go to the doctor's office?

07:22.091 --> 07:24.492
Oh, are you talking to me now?

07:24.527 --> 07:26.961
Is that something we're doing?

07:26.996 --> 07:28.662
Look, Quinn, I, um...

07:30.733 --> 07:32.333
I want to go back to work.

07:32.368 --> 07:35.903
Well, I appreciate that,
but Jay has Darius covered.

07:35.938 --> 07:39.507
He's my new Number Two, and
Madison is covering the rest.

07:43.613 --> 07:45.412
Okay. Uh, well...

07:45.448 --> 07:46.714
Come on, Rachel.

07:46.749 --> 07:48.415
Why don't you just sit this one out?

07:48.451 --> 07:50.317
You've had a rough couple of weeks.

07:50.353 --> 07:51.852
I'm totally fine. Seriously.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.522
I, um... I actually
could use a little help.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.725
Perfect. Madison could use some help.

07:59.929 --> 08:01.929
Yeah, I, um... I need someone

08:01.964 --> 08:04.498
to steam Tiffany's outfit for her date.

08:04.534 --> 08:05.934
Dream on, clueless. There is no way

08:05.968 --> 08:07.101
that I am going to take
orders from a girl

08:07.136 --> 08:08.736
whose one claim to producing

08:08.771 --> 08:10.731
is how much of her boss
she can keep in her mouth.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.707
You know, I saw Coleman

08:13.743 --> 08:15.843
sneaking out of
Yael's room this morning.

08:15.878 --> 08:18.112
I wouldn't be surprised
if there was a little

08:18.147 --> 08:20.047
boss-in-mouth action
happening there.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.917
A hot version of you is
stealing your little boyfriend

08:22.952 --> 08:24.752
right out from under your nose.

08:24.787 --> 08:26.387
So, who's clueless now?

08:35.443 --> 08:38.578
Okay. She's into you, and she's sexy.

08:38.613 --> 08:41.614
She doesn't flaunt it.
Just... just have fun.

08:41.650 --> 08:42.419
Darius, you look really good.

08:42.421 --> 08:44.617
- It's great to see you.
- Bitch, please.

08:44.653 --> 08:45.685
Can I just talk to you for a second?

08:45.721 --> 08:46.801
Yeah, sure, what's going...

08:46.822 --> 08:48.354
She's got some huge balls.

08:48.390 --> 08:49.870
So, why don't you tell me about Yael?

08:51.426 --> 08:52.926
- Okay, what about her?
- Why don't you tell me?

08:52.961 --> 08:54.928
I'm very curious to hear
what you have to say.

08:54.963 --> 08:57.430
I have no idea what
we're talking about right now.

08:57.466 --> 08:58.635
Well, you want to just take
it from the beginning?

08:58.638 --> 09:01.434
There was you and then her
in her room this morning.

09:01.470 --> 09:02.635
- Goldberg.
- Huh?

09:02.671 --> 09:03.348
I was doing my job.

09:03.349 --> 09:04.667
Oh, actually, you don't have a job.

09:04.668 --> 09:06.473
- You're in TV jail.
- Come with me.

09:06.508 --> 09:08.068
What is it? What's
the prob... Excuse me.

09:08.076 --> 09:09.375
The crew doesn't know that,
the girls don't know that.

09:09.411 --> 09:10.168
They think I'm still the showrunner.

09:10.169 --> 09:12.479
So, Yael's pissed she's not
getting enough screen time.

09:12.514 --> 09:13.880
She wants more
one-on-one time with Darius,

09:13.915 --> 09:15.415
- yada, yada, yada, it was...
- Right.

09:15.450 --> 09:16.916
And so, you're just like a
shoulder for her to cry on?

09:16.952 --> 09:19.390
Yeah, she got flirty,
she made a pass at me,

09:19.391 --> 09:23.790
but I shut it down
because I'm with you, 100%.

09:23.825 --> 09:25.592
We're on the same team here.

09:30.432 --> 09:32.499
Rachel.

09:32.534 --> 09:34.100
Don't push away

09:34.136 --> 09:36.056
the one person here who
actually cares about you.

09:40.342 --> 09:41.741
Hey, girl.

09:41.777 --> 09:45.979
Look... I know

09:46.014 --> 09:47.614
that must have been
pretty rough for you last night.

09:47.649 --> 09:50.083
It was humiliating, and I don't know

09:50.118 --> 09:52.252
why Darius would do that to me.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.753
It wasn't fair.

09:53.789 --> 09:57.499
Okay, look... Let
me... Are you miked right now?

09:57.663 --> 09:58.258
- Just let me turn this off.
- I'm always miked.

09:59.628 --> 10:02.362
Listen... I'm really
not supposed to do this,

10:02.397 --> 10:03.429
but Darius insisted.

10:03.465 --> 10:04.798
He wanted me to tell you

10:04.833 --> 10:06.366
that he's picking Tiffany in the end.

10:06.401 --> 10:08.134
Wait, what?!

10:08.170 --> 10:09.869
- Just keep it down.
- So it's over?

10:09.905 --> 10:12.138
Seriously, girl,
because Quinn would murder me

10:12.174 --> 10:13.439
if she knew I told you.

10:13.475 --> 10:15.341
Great. Great. So
I'll be humiliated again.

10:15.377 --> 10:17.844
- No. No.
- This show.

10:17.879 --> 10:19.846
Honey, I don't want that for you, okay?

10:19.881 --> 10:22.048
And Darius doesn't
want that for you, either.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.283
He likes you, Chantal.

10:23.318 --> 10:24.884
He thinks you're an amazing woman,

10:24.920 --> 10:26.820
and he thinks you deserve
to go out on your own terms.

10:26.855 --> 10:29.455
I thought we had something. You know?

10:29.491 --> 10:31.291
I know it sounds crazy

10:31.326 --> 10:34.494
but I really, really like him.

10:34.529 --> 10:37.797
Chantal, honey,
listen... Every season, runner-ups

10:37.833 --> 10:40.166
always say the same thing to me...

10:40.202 --> 10:42.635
"I wish I would have asked to leave

10:42.671 --> 10:44.404
before I could get dumped."

10:44.439 --> 10:46.139
Darius is giving you that opportunity.

10:59.588 --> 11:02.155
<i>Um, does anyone have eyes on Hot Rachel?</i>

11:02.190 --> 11:04.735
<i>I need her in hair and make-up STAT.</i>

11:12.868 --> 11:14.234
Go for Rachel.

11:14.269 --> 11:17.070
I'll take care of Hot Rachel.

11:17.105 --> 11:20.373
<i>Oh, um, thanks. Copy.</i>

11:20.408 --> 11:22.275
Happy to.

11:26.581 --> 11:30.216
So, at the elimination ceremony,
you'll tell Darius,

11:30.252 --> 11:32.952
and you'll tell the world,
you really like him,

11:32.988 --> 11:35.088
you had such a wonderful time here,

11:35.123 --> 11:37.190
but you're just not in love with him.

11:37.225 --> 11:39.792
So I just go home?

11:39.828 --> 11:41.394
Listen, when you leave,

11:41.429 --> 11:44.264
you will be able to
get any man you want.

11:44.299 --> 11:45.865
Trust me.

11:45.901 --> 11:48.034
If you were a dude, I
would be all over this.

11:48.069 --> 11:51.437
Okay?

11:51.473 --> 11:53.573
Okay.

12:01.449 --> 12:03.950
Oh, excuse me. Can I borrow
her for a minute?

12:03.985 --> 12:05.551
- Sure.
- You look amazing.

12:05.587 --> 12:07.387
Thank you, Rachel.
Hey, how are you doing?

12:07.422 --> 12:08.788
Oh, thank God, you're so sweet.

12:08.823 --> 12:10.223
I'm actually doing really fine.

12:10.258 --> 12:11.791
- Yeah? Good.
- Yeah, I am.

12:11.826 --> 12:14.160
You know, Madison wants to
get you in hair and make-up

12:14.195 --> 12:15.595
- to prep for your date.
- Oh!

12:15.630 --> 12:17.330
Are you taking orders from Madison now?

12:17.365 --> 12:18.765
Yeah, just doing my
job, just doing my job.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.266
- Actually...
- Huh?

12:20.302 --> 12:22.101
- You know what would be a huge help?
- Huh?

12:22.137 --> 12:24.237
Could you grab my dress for me,
from my room, the blue one?

12:24.272 --> 12:25.672
Y-yeah, I'd love to. The blue dress.

12:25.707 --> 12:27.407
I will... I will be right back.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.841
She's waiting for you.

12:28.877 --> 12:30.710
- Thank you. Thanks.
- I'll be back in two.

12:36.651 --> 12:38.785
Well, well, well.

12:38.820 --> 12:41.788
If it isn't Princess Grace herself.

12:41.856 --> 12:45.024
Hey, classy move that was
last night boning Darius.

12:46.561 --> 12:48.928
Oh, I don't see how
that's any of your business.

12:48.964 --> 12:51.864
Actually, it's exactly my business.

12:51.900 --> 12:55.835
We have a saying
around here... sluts get cut.

12:55.870 --> 13:01.808
Let me guess... If
I had screwed, say, you,

13:01.843 --> 13:04.143
I wouldn't be a slut, now, would I?

13:04.179 --> 13:07.280
I guess we'll never find out, will we?

13:07.315 --> 13:09.816
- I like Darius...
- Mm-hmm.

13:09.851 --> 13:11.551
And I intend to win.

13:11.586 --> 13:14.854
And if that doesn't
make you happy, I'm sorry,

13:14.889 --> 13:17.023
but that's the way it is.

13:31.740 --> 13:35.346
Yael, hey. So,
there's a flag on the play.

13:35.459 --> 13:37.577
The costume assistant was
steaming your blue dress,

13:37.578 --> 13:38.491
and she burned a hole in it.

13:38.492 --> 13:39.512
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

13:39.547 --> 13:41.514
Let me just be the first to apologize.

13:41.549 --> 13:43.249
But, look, I did find this dress.

13:43.284 --> 13:45.318
You know, it could be great.

13:45.353 --> 13:48.254
White looks amazing
on you... pop at sunset.

13:48.289 --> 13:51.891
Yeah... I mean, I guess
I don't have a choice.

13:51.926 --> 13:53.926
You're...
seriously? You're saving my life.

13:53.962 --> 13:55.995
Yeah, thank you, Rachel!

13:56.031 --> 13:57.230
- I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

13:57.265 --> 13:59.098
Okay, I've got a firm grip on the shaft.

13:59.134 --> 14:00.833
Now you just have to whack it, okay?

14:00.869 --> 14:02.935
I just whack it?
That's what you want me to do?

14:02.971 --> 14:04.537
- You want me to whack it?
- Look...

14:04.572 --> 14:08.007
Or whack off. Please, something
more exciting!

14:08.043 --> 14:10.877
I mean, these two screwed last night,

14:10.912 --> 14:14.380
and now they're doing
a commercial for Florida.

14:14.416 --> 14:17.116
Well, these are the dates
that Darius wanted, so...

14:17.152 --> 14:19.118
So, I'm sorry, you were telling me

14:19.154 --> 14:21.788
what a suitor wants as if
I would ever even care.

14:21.823 --> 14:23.122
You're his producer,

14:23.158 --> 14:26.926
and you're supposed to be my Number Two.

14:26.961 --> 14:29.962
So maybe that promotion
was a little premature.

14:29.998 --> 14:32.799
Let me remind you that you promoted me

14:32.834 --> 14:34.934
because I'm the one
that brought Darius back.

14:34.969 --> 14:36.129
Yeah, and you're the only one

14:36.137 --> 14:37.603
willing to be his little bitch.

14:37.639 --> 14:39.405
I mean, if this is
the best that you can do,

14:39.441 --> 14:41.874
then no wonder you only
have only one girl left,

14:41.910 --> 14:44.410
in your year of black power, no less.

14:44.446 --> 14:49.082
So, please, somebody get
out there and help me out.

14:49.117 --> 14:51.384
Pants him, light her hair
on fire, anything!

14:51.419 --> 14:53.052
I know you think Tiffany's a shoo-in,

14:53.088 --> 14:54.153
but I've still got two girls left,

14:54.189 --> 14:55.688
and one of them is black.

14:55.723 --> 14:58.991
You can just calm down,
Malcolm X, 'cause Chantal...

14:59.027 --> 15:01.794
She's actually dropping out
at the elimination ceremony.

15:01.830 --> 15:03.129
Did you say something to her?

15:03.164 --> 15:04.464
What did you say? You can't do that!

15:04.499 --> 15:06.065
Well, I can and did, so you better hope

15:06.101 --> 15:08.768
Hot Rachel brings it, bitch,
'cause she's your only hope.

15:08.803 --> 15:11.971
<i>Oh, and go! It's... Oh!</i>

15:12.006 --> 15:13.005
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

15:13.041 --> 15:14.841
- Yes!
- Hold up.

15:15.628 --> 15:17.561
Finally, somebody's getting wet!

15:17.597 --> 15:20.064
Oh, my... Oh, my God!
That's my... Please let...

15:20.099 --> 15:22.233
Okay, come here, come here,
come here, come here.

15:22.268 --> 15:24.068
Cut it! Damn it!

15:24.103 --> 15:27.504
Can somebody tell me what
the hell happened, anybody?

15:27.540 --> 15:29.060
- No, nobody?
- Put down those sprinklers.

15:29.075 --> 15:30.708
- Put down those sprinklers.
- A bunch of idiots.

15:30.743 --> 15:32.376
- You good?
- Yeah.

15:32.411 --> 15:34.411
All right. I'll talk to you
in a little bit, okay?

15:34.447 --> 15:35.846
Wait! Hey. You know, we...

15:35.882 --> 15:38.082
We really haven't gotten
a chance to, you know,

15:38.117 --> 15:40.217
talk away from the cameras
since last night.

15:40.253 --> 15:41.886
You know what? Let me... Let
me get out of these wet clothes,

15:41.921 --> 15:43.120
and then we can finish this, okay?

15:43.155 --> 15:45.189
What's going on with you? Are you okay?

15:45.224 --> 15:47.725
I-I thought we had a really nice time.

15:49.795 --> 15:53.030
Chet, did you seriously
just turn the sprinklers on?

15:53.065 --> 15:54.632
What are you, 12?

15:54.667 --> 15:56.967
Hey, you heard Quinn. They
have, like, zero chemistry.

15:57.003 --> 15:59.303
Chet, their chemistry is not the issue.

15:59.338 --> 16:01.705
And since when are you off Team Tiffany?

16:01.741 --> 16:04.308
Uh, since I want to help
the television show.

16:06.312 --> 16:09.079
Oh, my God. You're screwing her.

16:09.115 --> 16:11.148
I kissed her once.

16:11.183 --> 16:13.450
Chet, seriously, you kissed her?!

16:13.486 --> 16:15.619
That's so much worse!

16:15.655 --> 16:18.889
Last night might have been
just a little too fast, okay?

16:18.925 --> 16:20.824
I'm sorry I took advantage
of you like that.

16:20.860 --> 16:22.326
"Took advantage"?

16:22.361 --> 16:24.495
Darius, no. You didn't.

16:24.530 --> 16:26.931
You did not take advantage.
You came back.

16:26.966 --> 16:29.033
- You came back and you saved me...
- I did.

16:29.068 --> 16:30.567
- because of... of...
- I did.

16:30.603 --> 16:32.169
How we feel about each other.

16:32.204 --> 16:34.672
Right. I got to go.

16:34.707 --> 16:36.340
I'll catch up with you later, okay?

16:36.375 --> 16:37.608
Mm-hmm. Okay.

16:39.133 --> 16:41.700
I am serious, people.

16:41.736 --> 16:43.869
I cannot sit through another date

16:43.904 --> 16:46.605
that blows a hot, dry
wind through my vagina.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.875
Somebody get me excited. Madison.

16:49.910 --> 16:54.046
Uh, excited
vagina... I can... I can do that.

16:56.851 --> 16:58.884
It's like watching Bambi

16:58.919 --> 17:00.753
stumble through the woods, huh?

17:00.788 --> 17:02.254
What?

17:10.030 --> 17:12.330
Let me entertain you.

17:12.366 --> 17:15.400
Why?

17:15.435 --> 17:18.137
Because I want back in.

17:18.172 --> 17:20.339
I'm listening.

17:20.374 --> 17:21.973
Okay, well, you need something

17:22.009 --> 17:23.675
that you can build an episode on,

17:23.711 --> 17:26.779
a moment that people will
be talking about tomorrow.

17:26.814 --> 17:28.280
Mm. I know that look.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.982
Who's your target?

17:30.017 --> 17:31.817
Yael.

17:31.852 --> 17:34.620
Oh, Real Rachel versus Hot Rachel.

17:34.655 --> 17:36.855
Go for it.

17:36.891 --> 17:38.857
Thanks.

17:45.783 --> 17:47.550
Well, I just wanted to tell you

17:47.652 --> 17:49.018
that Darius found out

17:49.120 --> 17:50.486
that your favorite food
is sashimi, right?

17:50.589 --> 17:52.322
Yeah, and he ordered your favorite dish

17:52.424 --> 17:53.790
from your favorite restaurant.

17:53.892 --> 17:55.191
Sushi Nishi-Ya?

17:55.293 --> 17:56.459
Sushi Nishi-Ya, yellowtail,
scallion, ponzu.

17:56.561 --> 17:57.994
- Oh, my God, really?
- Yeah.

17:58.129 --> 17:59.862
- That is so sweet of him.
- So sweet of him. Yeah.

17:59.965 --> 18:01.965
Well, actually, I think
he just wants something

18:02.067 --> 18:03.399
- that you'll actually eat.
- Hmm?

18:03.501 --> 18:04.734
Do you know about Tiffany

18:04.836 --> 18:06.002
and her whole thing with the salads?

18:06.104 --> 18:07.303
Oh, yeah... raw kale,

18:07.405 --> 18:08.538
2 tablespoons of dressing on the side.

18:08.607 --> 18:10.047
No, it's 1 tablespoon. Crazy, right?

18:10.141 --> 18:12.021
Anyways, they had a
date today. It was terrible.

18:12.110 --> 18:14.477
He's just looking for someone
he can eat with,

18:14.579 --> 18:16.512
be himself with, so work your magic.

18:16.615 --> 18:18.214
The white dress... perfect.

18:18.316 --> 18:21.217
- Thank you, Rachel.
- Anytime.

18:21.319 --> 18:22.885
Okay, what's up with you?

18:22.988 --> 18:24.587
What are you talking about?

18:24.689 --> 18:26.556
You were way too happy, Rachel.

18:26.658 --> 18:28.138
What is your sneaky, little ass up to?

18:28.159 --> 18:29.525
Oh, I don't know.

18:29.628 --> 18:31.508
I'm just, like, producing
a TV show, Number Two.

18:31.627 --> 18:33.830
Living the dream.

18:33.932 --> 18:35.431
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

18:36.835 --> 18:38.475
- To a wonderful evening.
- To a first date.

18:38.503 --> 18:41.537
Bad girl. You know,
you shouldn't be up here.

18:42.974 --> 18:46.175
Yael gets dinner
and dancing by the pool,

18:46.277 --> 18:47.443
and I get golf?

18:47.545 --> 18:50.013
What is this, some kind of joke?

18:50.115 --> 18:52.548
Well, Darius gets to pick the dates.

18:52.651 --> 18:55.752
We should have done this
well before now, seriously.

18:55.854 --> 18:58.688
I mean, I've been trying
to get your attention,

18:58.790 --> 19:00.623
<i>but it's just the way
the show is, you know?</i>

19:02.794 --> 19:05.395
Well, that would get his attention.

19:05.463 --> 19:08.264
And after last night... Darius should be

19:08.366 --> 19:11.134
on his knees begging me to be with him.

19:11.236 --> 19:13.136
You're absolutely right.

19:13.271 --> 19:14.570
Any guy in his right mind

19:14.673 --> 19:17.774
would give his left nut
for a taste of you.

19:20.578 --> 19:22.945
Someone hasn't eaten in weeks.

19:23.048 --> 19:25.682
You want a taste?

19:25.784 --> 19:27.650
Yes, I do.

19:40.598 --> 19:42.565
Do you, uh, want to get in on this?

19:42.667 --> 19:45.454
I do not get down with the raw fish.

19:46.404 --> 19:49.272
<i>But I will get down
on this chicken teriyaki.</i>

19:49.374 --> 19:53.743
<i>Hmm. Got to say, I love the way you eat.</i>

19:53.845 --> 19:56.012
<i>I spent some time
in the south of France.</i>

19:56.114 --> 19:57.980
Eating there is a
very sensual experience.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.582
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

19:59.684 --> 20:01.350
I prepared a very special sauce.

20:01.486 --> 20:02.952
- Uh-oh.
- And?

20:03.054 --> 20:04.620
Keep watching.

20:04.723 --> 20:05.955
<i>Ah, look at your face!
Look at your face!</i>

20:06.057 --> 20:08.591
God, it's good to have you back.

20:11.396 --> 20:12.695
<i>So, what else did you do
while you were France?</i>

20:12.797 --> 20:14.931
Oh, excuse me, got to run, Number Two.

20:15.033 --> 20:17.033
- Oh, no. You're back there.
- Really?

20:17.135 --> 20:19.502
Really.

20:22.273 --> 20:24.440
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

20:24.542 --> 20:26.709
Oh, my God! Stop!

20:29.748 --> 20:31.013
Ah shut up Graham.

20:31.116 --> 20:34.383
<i>Darius and Yael will share a
sensuous dance as the sun sets.</i>

20:35.954 --> 20:38.354
- After you.
- Thank you.

20:38.456 --> 20:40.523
Okay.

20:42.060 --> 20:43.493
I got you, I got you.

20:43.595 --> 20:44.961
- Need a hand?
- Yes, I do.

20:46.609 --> 20:48.176
<i>Thank you. May I?</i>

20:48.278 --> 20:50.478
<i>What a beautiful evening in paradise.</i>

20:50.580 --> 20:54.182
Just give me a minute. Don't move, okay?

20:54.284 --> 20:56.451
Okay. Oh, oh.

20:56.553 --> 20:58.113
Be right back. Just need a quick minute.

20:58.121 --> 20:59.387
- We're taking five.
- We're not gonna take five.

20:59.489 --> 21:01.155
Sweetie, it's just gonna
be a few minutes.

21:01.257 --> 21:02.356
Sweetie, we have a few more seconds.

21:02.459 --> 21:03.958
You look amazing. Here we go.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.194
It's not that. I really
have to use the restroom.

21:06.296 --> 21:08.162
She looks distressed. Of mind and body.

21:08.264 --> 21:09.530
We are really about to lose the light.

21:09.632 --> 21:11.032
Can I have that cane back?

21:11.134 --> 21:12.400
- Okay. Yeah, okay.
- Get ready, here we go...

21:12.502 --> 21:13.634
Mostly body.

21:13.736 --> 21:15.303
Why aren't they breaking for her?

21:15.405 --> 21:17.238
I mean... Rachel, can you cut?

21:17.340 --> 21:19.073
See, that's what you call
"Commitment," people.

21:19.175 --> 21:20.975
Here we go! Roll
camera! Let's get that crane in.

21:21.077 --> 21:22.477
- Come on, guys.
- Keep rolling, guys.

21:22.479 --> 21:23.759
- Keep rolling, guys.
- Here we go!

21:23.813 --> 21:27.081
- Ready, and action!
- Uh...

21:28.318 --> 21:29.278
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.222
- Ooh! You have nails!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

21:34.324 --> 21:36.891
That girl needs to go.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.192
Are you sure you're all right?

21:39.462 --> 21:40.695
Y-yeah, yeah. You look so handsome.

21:40.797 --> 21:42.077
Thank you.

21:42.098 --> 21:43.064
And you look so...

21:43.166 --> 21:44.866
No, I can't. Oh, my God. No!

21:44.968 --> 21:46.100
- Oh, wait.
- Oh, my God!

21:46.202 --> 21:47.502
Wait.

21:47.604 --> 21:49.036
Does anyone have the key for this?!

21:49.139 --> 21:50.371
Oh, my God!
Somebody, please, just open up!

21:50.473 --> 21:52.039
- The door is locked?
- Oh, my God!

21:52.142 --> 21:54.442
Can someone unlock this, please?
Does anybody have a key?

21:54.544 --> 21:56.711
Unlock this now!
Does anybody have the key?

21:56.813 --> 21:57.745
- Does anybody have...
- Yael!

21:57.847 --> 21:58.913
- Oh, my God!
- Yael!

21:59.015 --> 22:00.581
- Wait, I have...
- No, no, no, no!

22:00.683 --> 22:02.216
- Darius, Darius, Darius, please!
- Yael, let me try...

22:02.318 --> 22:03.451
Please, Darius, Darius, please, go away.

22:03.553 --> 22:04.833
Yael, I got you. Do the whole...

22:04.888 --> 22:05.887
Just please, trust me, just go away!

22:05.989 --> 22:06.954
Oh, my God!

22:07.056 --> 22:08.356
Oh, no.

22:08.458 --> 22:10.424
Oh, shit!

22:10.527 --> 22:13.060
Ohh!

22:13.163 --> 22:14.896
Yikes.

22:16.466 --> 22:18.132
No, she was my last hope!

22:18.234 --> 22:20.801
That is what I'm talking about, people!

22:20.904 --> 22:24.739
That is what you call drama!

22:24.841 --> 22:25.907
<i>Tablecloth, get me the tablecloth.</i>

22:26.009 --> 22:27.141
What happened?

22:27.243 --> 22:29.610
Danny, help me with the tablecloth!

22:32.215 --> 22:37.885
Hot Rachel just shit herself
on national television.

22:37.987 --> 22:40.588
Boom! Drop the mike!

22:43.860 --> 22:45.693
Please, please go away.

22:48.198 --> 22:51.065
Why?

22:54.370 --> 22:56.704
Yeah, so, um, maybe that white dress

22:56.806 --> 22:59.207
wasn't such a good idea, after all.

23:02.178 --> 23:05.780
Yeah, can we get some, uh, baby wipes

23:05.882 --> 23:08.249
and maybe a hose for Hot Rachel? Thanks.

23:08.351 --> 23:11.752
She needs a hose! She needs a hose!

23:15.225 --> 23:17.158
Wardrobe...

23:23.883 --> 23:26.450
Right, see? It's not just me.

23:26.485 --> 23:28.352
Everybody's laughing. Come on.

23:28.387 --> 23:30.187
Hats off. Hats off, Goldberg!

23:30.223 --> 23:32.790
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

23:32.825 --> 23:35.659
I cannot even begin to tell
you how nuts that was.

23:35.695 --> 23:37.494
What are you talking about?

23:37.530 --> 23:39.630
Rachel, that was actually insane.

23:39.665 --> 23:40.965
You get that, right?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Darius wanted Yael for the final two,

23:43.035 --> 23:45.536
and you just had to destroy
her, didn't you?

23:45.571 --> 23:47.938
Wow, way to bum out our mood, Jay!

23:47.974 --> 23:50.975
This isn't fantasy camp for
football players, all right?

23:51.010 --> 23:54.845
Never let your star run the show, Jay!

23:54.881 --> 23:57.314
D., I am so sorry.

23:57.350 --> 23:58.816
Jay, you said you had me.

23:58.851 --> 24:00.618
I do. It's those two crazy
bitches out there.

24:00.653 --> 24:02.987
Nah, 'cause this show is
still making me look bad.

24:03.022 --> 24:06.541
I mean, it's terrible what
they did to that woman.

24:08.895 --> 24:12.062
Is it true that you're planning
on dropping out tonight?

24:13.931 --> 24:15.897
Jay said Darius is gonna
choose Tiffany, so...

24:16.298 --> 24:17.697
Oh, Jay said?

24:17.733 --> 24:21.601
You do realize that
he's playing you, right?

24:21.637 --> 24:23.203
He just wants you out of the way

24:23.238 --> 24:24.471
so his girl Tiffany can win.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.539
He gets a cash bonus if she does.

24:26.575 --> 24:28.775
And do you get a cash bonus if I win?

24:28.810 --> 24:29.780
Damn straight.

24:29.922 --> 24:32.278
And you get one if I make
it to the final two?

24:32.314 --> 24:33.647
Yeah, but it's not as big.

24:33.682 --> 24:35.148
Well, it's big
enough for you to not care

24:35.183 --> 24:36.583
if I get dumped on national television.

24:36.618 --> 24:38.785
And, what, that's my bonus, right,

24:38.820 --> 24:40.820
ruin my reputation for forever?

24:40.856 --> 24:42.756
No thanks.

24:42.791 --> 24:44.924
Look, I am going to look ridiculous

24:44.960 --> 24:46.292
choosing Yael over Chantal.

24:46.328 --> 24:47.661
No, Darius, no.

24:47.696 --> 24:49.796
Look, I told you, I got you, okay?

24:49.831 --> 24:52.399
Chantal agreed to bow
out gracefully tonight.

24:52.434 --> 24:53.800
It's gonna be fine, man.

24:53.835 --> 24:55.568
- And you're sure about this?
- Yes.

24:55.604 --> 24:57.237
It's gonna be perfect, actually,

24:57.272 --> 24:58.772
because now when you choose Tiffany,

24:58.807 --> 25:00.440
the whole world's gonna be on your side.

25:00.475 --> 25:03.109
It's fine. Chill, okay?

25:03.145 --> 25:05.945
I got you.

25:05.981 --> 25:07.580
You better, Jay.

25:09.718 --> 25:12.419
If you're worried about your reputation,

25:12.454 --> 25:14.320
don't you think walking out now

25:14.356 --> 25:15.922
is gonna make you seem like

25:15.957 --> 25:18.458
even more of an entitled,
prissy cock tease?

25:18.493 --> 25:20.293
- What?
- I don't think that.

25:20.328 --> 25:23.163
I don't. I really don't.
It's all social media.

25:23.198 --> 25:24.700
I forget that you guys
don't get to see it.

25:24.701 --> 25:25.795
That is not fair!

25:25.947 --> 25:27.600
Just because I'm trying to stay classy

25:27.636 --> 25:29.135
in a room full of skanks, like...

25:29.171 --> 25:30.370
I get that. I totally do.

25:30.405 --> 25:31.771
It's just, you know,

25:31.807 --> 25:34.307
you're such a reserved kind of person.

25:34.342 --> 25:37.550
I mean, maybe you're just
too good for Darius anyways.

25:37.711 --> 25:40.146
No! Darius is amazing.

25:40.182 --> 25:41.648
Is that what he thinks?

25:41.683 --> 25:43.817
I act like I'm too good for him?

25:43.852 --> 25:45.952
No, um, it's just...

25:45.987 --> 25:50.123
Tiffany... she
really puts herself out there.

25:50.158 --> 25:51.725
You know?

25:51.760 --> 25:54.561
She's not afraid to show
Darius how she feels.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.972
But I don't want to make a
fool out of myself again.

25:57.137 --> 25:59.799
So don't. Look, if you truly,

25:59.835 --> 26:02.302
100% committed... I mean, look at you.

26:02.337 --> 26:04.304
It wouldn't even be a contest.

26:04.339 --> 26:09.576
If you don't want to
be a loser, then win.

26:16.918 --> 26:19.652
It's been a long and stressful
day here at "Everlasting."

26:19.688 --> 26:21.554
"Stressful day."

26:21.590 --> 26:23.389
What's he been doing,
napping and whacking off?

26:23.425 --> 26:27.660
<i>Darius and Chantal try
to find peace and love</i>

26:27.696 --> 26:29.028
<i>here in the hot tub.</i>

26:29.064 --> 26:30.864
Why does everything he
say sound so creepy?

26:30.899 --> 26:32.432
Let's be honest,

26:32.467 --> 26:35.201
everything is just a letdown
ever since Shitgate.

26:37.139 --> 26:38.772
Oh, here comes Chantal.

26:38.807 --> 26:41.274
She's just gonna fawn all over him

26:41.309 --> 26:44.410
with her virginal,
dead-fiancéd self, again.

26:44.446 --> 26:45.845
You know, I think she might
surprise you tonight.

26:46.962 --> 26:48.782
I think she might surprise
everyone tonight.

26:48.817 --> 26:51.718
Darius, I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

26:51.753 --> 26:54.387
about who I am, and who you are,

26:54.422 --> 26:56.356
and what I've been doing
here at "Everlasting" and...

26:56.391 --> 26:59.392
And what you had for
breakfast, and why you wore this robe.

26:59.427 --> 27:01.694
I have something I need to say to you.

27:01.730 --> 27:03.530
<i>Okay.</i>

27:07.602 --> 27:10.537
Oh! Girl is naked!

27:10.572 --> 27:12.138
You're not hiding anymore.

27:12.174 --> 27:13.373
Hey, hey... Eyes up here.

27:13.408 --> 27:15.208
I mean, that is butt-naked!

27:18.079 --> 27:19.279
Wow.

27:19.314 --> 27:21.614
Mm. Wait a minute...

27:21.650 --> 27:24.484
Who are you, and what have
you done with Chantal?

27:24.519 --> 27:25.752
Yeah, no shit.

27:25.787 --> 27:26.820
<i>I think it's about time</i>

27:26.855 --> 27:27.887
you got to know the real me.

27:27.923 --> 27:30.657
Damn.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.659
Penis grab! Yes!

27:32.694 --> 27:34.394
Do we ever clean that thing?

27:34.429 --> 27:36.329
Every time Graham gets out of it.

27:36.364 --> 27:39.632
Ohh.

27:39.668 --> 27:42.435
Look at that. She's in it to win it.

27:42.470 --> 27:44.304
Great job, Madison.

27:44.339 --> 27:49.609
You and Rachel
really brought it tonight.

27:49.644 --> 27:51.077
Good job.

27:51.112 --> 27:53.012
That thing you pulled on Yael

27:53.048 --> 27:55.748
why have we never done that before?

27:55.784 --> 27:57.016
You are a mad genius.

27:57.052 --> 27:58.785
Come on, you're telling me

27:58.820 --> 28:01.487
your entire career you've
never done that one?

28:01.523 --> 28:05.058
Never, and now, like, I can't
even imagine not doing it.

28:05.093 --> 28:10.096
I mean, it might be the
worst thing that we have ever done.

28:10.131 --> 28:12.031
Well, we both know that's not true.

28:12.067 --> 28:14.167
Oh, you have to let that go.

28:14.202 --> 28:16.836
Mnh-mnh.

28:16.872 --> 28:18.671
You don't ever think about Mary?

28:18.707 --> 28:21.507
No. I like to sleep at night, okay?

28:21.543 --> 28:22.976
You care too much.

28:23.011 --> 28:25.778
Just like that one...

28:25.814 --> 28:27.132
I mean, I just think

28:27.133 --> 28:28.781
it's really hard to live
with what we did.

28:28.817 --> 28:32.185
Okay, first of all, we didn't
do anything, Shia did.

28:32.220 --> 28:34.554
Mary was dead.

28:34.589 --> 28:37.523
There was nothing that
we could do to change that.

28:37.559 --> 28:39.058
But we covered it up.

28:39.094 --> 28:41.461
I cover things up all the time!

28:41.496 --> 28:44.230
That's my job. I
mean, do you really think

28:44.266 --> 28:46.633
that your whole car pullover stunt

28:46.668 --> 28:48.534
just went away like magic?

28:48.570 --> 28:50.403
Poof! Buh-bye!

28:50.438 --> 28:54.073
You were on probation for
grand theft auto, remember?

28:54.109 --> 28:57.310
You called in a false
report of a stolen car,

28:57.345 --> 28:59.045
and you got a guy shot.

28:59.080 --> 29:02.815
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be in prison right now.

29:02.851 --> 29:05.251
Prison. Behind bars.

29:05.287 --> 29:06.686
How did you do that?

29:06.721 --> 29:10.490
I have a lot of friends
and a pile of cash.

29:10.525 --> 29:15.161
You really think we
need $100,000 "Greens" budget

29:15.196 --> 29:19.599
when we shoot in Marin county
where it rains every day?

29:19.634 --> 29:23.836
Wow, I can't believe that you,
uh, you did that for me.

29:23.872 --> 29:27.106
That's the difference between you and I.

29:27.142 --> 29:30.843
I limit the number of people
that I care about

29:30.879 --> 29:34.213
to, like, two.

29:34.249 --> 29:36.282
Hmm.

29:37.485 --> 29:38.618
Speaking of one of them.

29:38.653 --> 29:40.753
- Booth booty?
- Mm-hmm.

29:40.789 --> 29:42.722
He's pulling up to the mansion,

29:42.757 --> 29:45.191
and he likes to
text me about everything,

29:45.226 --> 29:47.961
from his, like, fancy,
little watch-phone thing.

29:47.996 --> 29:50.630
- It's very corny.
- Cute.

29:50.665 --> 29:52.385
So, it's, like, real
between the two of you?

29:52.400 --> 29:57.136
Yeah.

29:57.172 --> 29:58.771
You know what? We have got to go.

29:58.807 --> 30:02.275
We have an
elimination ceremony to prepare.

30:02.310 --> 30:04.777
Mm! I don't wanna.

30:05.914 --> 30:08.648
Welcome back, Goldberg.

30:08.683 --> 30:10.783
I missed you.

30:10.819 --> 30:13.586
It's much more
entertaining when you're around.

30:13.621 --> 30:16.889
- It's good to be back.
- Come on.

30:22.219 --> 30:24.018
So, what happened to "bowing
out gracefully"?

30:24.054 --> 30:25.320
Oh, please.

30:25.355 --> 30:27.288
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

30:27.324 --> 30:29.457
Selling me out for a cash bonus, really?

30:29.493 --> 30:31.279
Oh, no, no, no, honey.
That is not how it went down.

30:31.428 --> 30:34.295
- I am trying to help you.
- Okay, save it.

30:34.331 --> 30:35.497
You underestimated me.

30:35.532 --> 30:37.365
I'm not some airhead pageant girl.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.467
I like Darius, but if
he wants to cut me,

30:39.503 --> 30:41.669
he can do it himself
on national television.

30:41.705 --> 30:44.839
But I heard about what
happened on Yael's date.

30:44.875 --> 30:46.141
I like my chances.

30:48.145 --> 30:51.479
- Yeah.
- I know.

30:51.515 --> 30:53.815
Oh, what is happening here?

30:53.850 --> 30:56.851
What is with these gold curtains?

30:56.887 --> 30:58.853
Don't even get me started. Move.

30:58.889 --> 31:01.890
- Ohh...
- Uh-oh, is someone still stinky?

31:01.925 --> 31:04.959
Oh, that is cold, Tiffany, cold!

31:04.995 --> 31:07.362
Let's get a wide shot.

31:07.397 --> 31:08.797
What? What's that face?

31:08.832 --> 31:10.298
Nothing.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.200
Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts

31:12.235 --> 31:13.535
about destroying Hot Rachel.

31:13.570 --> 31:14.569
No second thoughts, no.

31:14.604 --> 31:17.405
Okay. Good. All right.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.207
Let's get this party started, people.

31:21.278 --> 31:24.078
Well, America, we are down to three...

31:24.114 --> 31:27.615
<i>Chantal, Tiffany, and Yael.</i>

31:27.651 --> 31:31.486
Who will Darius send home?

31:34.724 --> 31:36.758
Stage is yours, Darius.

31:39.963 --> 31:43.198
Yael, I'm sorry.

31:43.233 --> 31:45.567
Um, I just can't see us being together.

31:45.602 --> 31:48.036
I understand.

31:48.071 --> 31:49.471
Thank you for the past eight weeks.

31:49.472 --> 31:51.272
I've learned so much.

31:51.308 --> 31:54.876
<i>I'll never forget my
time here at "Everlasting."</i>

31:54.911 --> 31:57.245
No one will! No one will, Yael,

31:57.280 --> 31:59.714
because we are going to broadcast

31:59.749 --> 32:02.050
your crap-tastic diarrhea-fest

32:02.085 --> 32:04.352
on a loop until the day I die.

32:04.387 --> 32:06.387
Thank you very much.

32:06.423 --> 32:10.358
Poor Yael. Oh, well.

32:10.393 --> 32:11.793
<i>And then there were two.</i>

32:11.828 --> 32:14.028
Yeah, it kind of brings
back a whole, new meaning

32:14.064 --> 32:15.930
to "Elimination Ceremony."

32:15.966 --> 32:18.199
Okay, so, you thought about what I said?

32:18.235 --> 32:19.875
Yeah, I thought a lot
about what you said,

32:19.903 --> 32:22.036
and a lot about what we've done

32:22.072 --> 32:25.073
over the last couple
of weeks, and I am just...

32:25.108 --> 32:26.608
I'm not gonna take down the show.

32:26.643 --> 32:28.643
I'm not gonna take down Quinn
just because you need,

32:28.678 --> 32:30.745
like, some kind of
project to jump-start your career

32:30.780 --> 32:32.580
- and that's what this all...
- No. That's not...

32:32.616 --> 32:34.749
Yes, it is! I promise
you, that's not what this is.

32:34.784 --> 32:36.084
- Rachel...
- It's over, Coleman!

32:36.119 --> 32:37.485
- No, it's not over.
- Yes, it is over!

32:37.520 --> 32:38.987
This is about... This is about justice.

32:39.022 --> 32:40.455
She has no remorse
for the things she's done,

32:40.490 --> 32:41.810
- and she admits as much.
- Wha...

32:41.825 --> 32:43.725
What are you talking about?

32:43.760 --> 32:46.594
<i>I have a lot of friends
and a pile of cash.</i>

32:46.630 --> 32:48.229
We, uh...

32:48.478 --> 32:51.378
<i>You really think we need
$100,000 "Greens" budget?</i>

32:51.414 --> 32:52.780
How did you get that?

32:52.815 --> 32:54.615
I know some hackers, and they taught me,

32:54.650 --> 32:56.617
so I tapped your phone,
turned on the mike...

32:56.652 --> 32:58.352
- You tapped my phone?
- Yes. I did this for...

32:58.387 --> 33:00.121
You... Wait, excuse
me... You tapped my phone?

33:00.156 --> 33:02.156
Yes, I did. I knew it
would be hard for you,

33:02.191 --> 33:03.958
and we need this kind of evidence.

33:03.993 --> 33:06.427
I'm not gonna let you pay
for her actions, I'm just not.

33:06.462 --> 33:08.592
I started cutting this into our piece.

33:08.727 --> 33:11.999
- Uh-huh.
- It plays so well.

33:12.034 --> 33:14.702
This is all we need.

33:18.407 --> 33:20.241
Oh! Come on, come on!

33:20.276 --> 33:22.710
This is it, Rachel.

33:22.745 --> 33:27.214
This is it.

33:27.250 --> 33:30.217
Okay. So, what do we do?

33:30.253 --> 33:32.253
We just, like, take her
down instead of me?

33:32.288 --> 33:34.889
- Yes!
- Yes. Okay.

33:34.924 --> 33:35.963
I told you right from the start...

33:36.079 --> 33:37.679
You've outgrown her, you don't need her.

33:38.208 --> 33:38.859
- This...
- Yeah.

33:38.895 --> 33:41.262
This is our future, you and me.

33:41.297 --> 33:43.597
And I found a place.

33:43.633 --> 33:45.366
Yeah? And what kind of place?

33:45.401 --> 33:46.700
It's for you to get healthy.

33:46.736 --> 33:47.666
And you can work things out

33:47.669 --> 33:49.537
with a therapist who isn't your mother.

33:49.572 --> 33:52.072
You just need to talk
this stuff through.

33:52.108 --> 33:53.641
You can finally just rest.

33:53.676 --> 33:56.410
- Oh, wow.
- And just... just relax.

33:56.445 --> 33:59.180
It's a residential program.
A month to start...

33:59.215 --> 34:02.183
I'm, like, so touched right now,

34:02.218 --> 34:04.118
and thank you so much, Coleman.

34:04.153 --> 34:07.087
I'm, like, so sorry that
I was, like, getting jealous

34:07.123 --> 34:09.690
and acting all crazy
about Yael, I'm so sorry.

34:09.725 --> 34:11.759
- But you were just...
- Don't, don't.

34:11.793 --> 34:13.092
You were totally right.

34:13.129 --> 34:15.029
You're, like, truly the only person

34:15.063 --> 34:16.964
that, like, actually cares about me.

34:16.998 --> 34:20.900
I just want you to be happy
and healthy and whole.

34:20.937 --> 34:22.036
Mm-hmm.

34:24.806 --> 34:26.239
You're gonna get better.

34:26.275 --> 34:28.876
- Mm.
- You will.

34:28.911 --> 34:34.648
And then we are
gonna burn this place down.

34:34.684 --> 34:36.617
Yes, we are.

34:38.987 --> 34:41.455
And then we're gonna have
the life that we both deserve.

34:41.489 --> 34:44.158
Rachel, we need you on set!

34:44.193 --> 34:45.759
You know what?

34:45.795 --> 34:48.596
Um, just give me, like, a few minutes

34:48.630 --> 34:49.830
before I head down there.

34:49.864 --> 34:51.498
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

34:51.534 --> 34:52.600
You're good.

34:52.635 --> 34:53.766
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

34:53.803 --> 34:56.303
Oh, my God.

35:09.078 --> 35:11.211
What are you doing?

35:11.247 --> 35:13.480
Getting out of here!

35:13.516 --> 35:16.250
Yael... hey!

35:16.285 --> 35:17.918
They are not gonna let you leave here

35:17.953 --> 35:19.419
till after the finale, so we ne...

35:19.455 --> 35:20.821
Let 'em sue me! I don't care!

35:20.856 --> 35:22.389
These people are insane!
I'm not staying here!

35:22.424 --> 35:24.191
Okay, no, no. Just take
a breath, take a breath,

35:24.226 --> 35:26.093
'cause I have everything we
need to take them down, I do.

35:26.128 --> 35:27.528
The stuff you gave me from Jeremy,

35:27.563 --> 35:28.729
I have Rachel back on board right now.

35:28.764 --> 35:30.197
We are this close right now.

35:30.232 --> 35:31.265
We're gonna make
them pay for everything.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.766
I am not safe here.

35:32.801 --> 35:35.369
Did you see what they did to me?

35:35.404 --> 35:37.070
Did you see what Rachel did?

35:37.106 --> 35:39.506
- Yeah. I'm sorry.
- She poisoned me, Coleman!

35:39.542 --> 35:41.375
There are cameras everywhere!

35:45.781 --> 35:48.849
I just wanted to congratulate you

35:48.884 --> 35:53.687
on making the final two
and give you this.

35:53.722 --> 35:57.224
Oh, my goodness.

36:01.597 --> 36:03.230
Ooh.

36:05.568 --> 36:08.936
That is one lucky piece of jewelry.

36:08.971 --> 36:10.904
Mmm.

36:12.107 --> 36:14.441
No, these... These women are damaged,

36:14.476 --> 36:15.576
crazy, lonely people.

36:15.611 --> 36:17.244
They have to hurt other people

36:17.279 --> 36:19.379
and manipulate them to make
themselves feel better.

36:19.415 --> 36:22.583
No one will ever look at
me the same way again.

36:22.618 --> 36:24.318
Oh, my gosh, no.

36:24.353 --> 36:27.087
No, no, that's not true
because you're beautiful,

36:27.122 --> 36:29.556
and you're smart,
and you're a good person.

36:29.592 --> 36:32.059
And you're sexy as hell.

36:32.094 --> 36:35.462
We're gonna get them back.

36:35.497 --> 36:37.397
Yeah.

36:37.433 --> 36:38.665
Oh, yeah.

36:50.179 --> 36:53.480
All ri... Yes, yes.

36:53.515 --> 36:56.583
I am here. I am listening.

36:56.619 --> 36:58.452
No, it's a... It's a great time.

36:58.487 --> 36:59.553
It's a perfect time.

37:08.697 --> 37:10.764
I-I... Yes.

37:16.972 --> 37:20.540
Yes, Doctor. I understand.

37:22.578 --> 37:26.046
Yeah. I'm fine. Uh-huh.

37:26.081 --> 37:27.381
Thank you.

37:29.685 --> 37:31.518
Quinn, what is it?

37:31.553 --> 37:35.022
I never even wanted
to have kids anyways.

37:40.996 --> 37:44.131
Look, whatever this
thing is, we can manage it.

37:44.166 --> 37:46.566
I have resources. There must be some...

37:46.602 --> 37:48.502
There's something you can buy to fix it?

37:48.537 --> 37:49.670
There isn't. It's over.

37:53.175 --> 37:54.241
Quinn...

37:54.276 --> 37:56.410
No, just go.

37:56.445 --> 38:00.080
Okay, look, why don't we, uh...

38:00.115 --> 38:01.348
Why don't we talk about this tomorrow?

38:01.383 --> 38:02.883
That's not necessary.

38:02.918 --> 38:04.651
Are you serious?

38:04.687 --> 38:07.754
You don't even want to try
to figure this thing out?

38:07.790 --> 38:10.323
There is nothing to figure out, dumbass.

38:10.359 --> 38:12.859
You want kids, and I can't have them.

38:12.895 --> 38:15.228
So get the hell out of my life.

38:15.264 --> 38:17.145
I don't really don't know
who you are right now.

38:17.191 --> 38:19.354
Well, I know who you are...

38:19.390 --> 38:21.723
a guy who gets everything he wants.

38:26.294 --> 38:28.764
And I won't be anybody's disappointment.

38:32.503 --> 38:35.203
- Quinn, please. Quinn!
- I have work to do.

38:35.239 --> 38:38.440
Are you really gonna let me walk away?

38:45.949 --> 38:47.382
Yes.

38:58.529 --> 39:01.296
Everybody, get out. Out!

39:01.331 --> 39:06.234
- Quinn, what is...
- Get out! Now! Go! Faster!

39:06.270 --> 39:09.671
Get out of here!!

39:39.870 --> 39:42.337
Quinn?

39:42.372 --> 39:44.806
You okay?

39:46.243 --> 39:49.611
No one ever tells you when it's over.

39:49.646 --> 39:52.848
No one ever shows up at your work

39:52.883 --> 39:55.650
and says, "Hey, this is it.

39:55.686 --> 39:58.887
This is your last chance to have kids.

39:58.922 --> 40:00.889
What do you think, Quinn?"

40:00.924 --> 40:02.390
You want kids, Quinn?

40:02.426 --> 40:04.659
I wanted a choice!!

40:04.695 --> 40:08.597
I wanted a choice.

40:15.072 --> 40:17.138
I need you to get out of here.

40:17.174 --> 40:21.176
You got to go, okay,
while you still have time.

40:21.211 --> 40:23.845
Just go, be with that douchebag Coleman.

40:23.881 --> 40:26.348
I don't care. I just
want you to be happy.

40:26.383 --> 40:28.683
- Quinn, listen to me.
- Just don't get stuck here.

40:28.719 --> 40:30.919
No, okay? Quinn...

40:30.954 --> 40:33.889
I love you. I love you.

40:33.924 --> 40:36.758
You're fired. Fired.

40:36.793 --> 40:38.560
Coleman knows.

40:38.595 --> 40:41.663
What?

40:41.698 --> 40:44.533
A-about Mary... The payouts
and the cover-ups

40:44.568 --> 40:47.335
and everything, and he's
about to expose us.

40:47.371 --> 40:49.671
I am so sorry, Quinn.

40:49.706 --> 40:52.059
Listen, I was so wrong to trust him,

40:52.109 --> 40:53.909
but, Quinn, we...
We really just right now,

40:53.944 --> 40:55.110
we really have to stop him.

41:00.450 --> 41:03.218
Quinn, suck it up. I need you.

41:07.958 --> 41:10.158
We're taking that asshole down.
