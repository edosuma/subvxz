BALKI:
Okay, Mama, if you thought
the parking lot was spectacular

01:27.100 --> 01:30.200
wait until you see what
I’m going to show you next.

01:30.233 --> 01:32.100
Because, Mama...

01:32.133 --> 01:35.266
This is where
Cousin Larry and I work!

01:35.300 --> 01:39.800
Yes, Mama Bartokomous,
this is Cousin Larry’s desk.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.433
And this is his
favorite coffee cup.

01:42.466 --> 01:44.466
I gave it to him
last Christmas.

01:46.133 --> 01:48.433
This is Cousin Larry’s
pencil cup.

01:48.466 --> 01:51.533
And this
is Cousin Larry’s typewriter

01:51.566 --> 01:53.466
and this...

01:53.500 --> 01:55.633
Is Cousin Larry!

01:55.666 --> 01:57.800
Don’t you want to just
pinch them little cheeks?

01:57.833 --> 02:00.400
Eee‐dee‐dee‐dee.

02:00.433 --> 02:02.800
Where’d you get the camera?
Cousin, I rented it.

02:02.833 --> 02:05.033
I’m, I’m going to make
a videotape story

02:05.066 --> 02:06.300
of my life for Mama.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.333
I’m the guest of honor
at this year’s

02:08.366 --> 02:12.000
Bartokomous family
reunion and jamboriki.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.266
You’re going to Mypos?
Well, of course, I’m not.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.233
Don’t be ridiculous.

02:19.266 --> 02:21.200
I’m sending this tape
in my place.

02:21.233 --> 02:24.633
Everyone will ask,
"Is it Balki or is it Memorex?"

02:24.666 --> 02:27.533
Where do I
come up with them?

02:28.833 --> 02:30.633
Well, that’s
a very nice idea, Balki,

02:30.666 --> 02:33.200
but you have
a minor technical problem.

02:33.233 --> 02:35.233
Cousin,
I’m way ahead of you.

02:35.266 --> 02:37.800
I have already
taken off the lens cap

02:37.833 --> 02:40.233
and I’m looking
through the small end.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.600
No, what I mean is, your mama
won’t be able to watch this

02:45.633 --> 02:49.166
without a video
cassette playback machine.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.633
See, the tape you’re making
goes into a machine‐‐

02:51.666 --> 02:54.333
You mean a VCR?
Mama has one.

02:57.266 --> 02:59.033
They have VCRs on Mypos?

02:59.066 --> 03:01.266
Well, they have one,
Mama rented it from

03:01.300 --> 03:05.300
Vito Vavoomikis Video Land
and Sheep Shearing Emporium.

03:07.433 --> 03:09.633
Ah, but does she
have a TV set?

03:09.666 --> 03:11.766
Well, I tell you,
last fall,

03:11.800 --> 03:13.733
Poknok the peddler
came through town

03:13.766 --> 03:16.200
with his donkey
all loaded down

03:16.233 --> 03:19.333
with pots and pans
and dried herbs

03:19.366 --> 03:22.333
and a 50‐inch
rear‐projection TV set.

03:24.233 --> 03:29.200
Mama got it on Poknok’s
famous revolving credit plan.

03:29.233 --> 03:32.366
If you don’t pay,
he straps you to a windmill.

03:35.366 --> 03:37.466
Well, you’ve got
the technology.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.566
What’s your movie about?

03:39.600 --> 03:42.566
I thought I’d just let
the camera run for 24 hours

03:42.600 --> 03:44.033
and call it,

03:44.066 --> 03:47.233
"24 hours In
The Life Of Balki Bartokomous."

03:49.533 --> 03:51.200
And we’re leaving
Cousin Larry

03:51.233 --> 03:52.666
and them
pinchable little cheeks.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.800
Eee‐dee‐dee‐dee.

03:54.833 --> 03:57.766
And what do we see?
Balki’s workplace.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.033
Mama, this, this is my table.

04:00.066 --> 04:03.766
And this is a letter
that’s going
to the second floor.

04:04.633 --> 04:05.700
And this is a letter...

04:05.733 --> 04:06.766
Hello, Larry.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.366
Hi, Lydia.
Hello, Balki.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.533
Hi, Ms. Lydia.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.433
What have you
got there, Balki?

04:11.466 --> 04:15.066
Well,
you don’t want to know.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.700
Yes, I do.

04:16.733 --> 04:18.600
Well, it’s, it’s the thing that

04:18.632 --> 04:20.733
frightens you most
in the whole world.

04:22.333 --> 04:25.700
You have a copy of
my driver’s license photograph?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.666
No, Ms. Lydia,
it’s a video camera.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.600
I’m, I’m making a tape
of my life to send home
to Mama

04:32.633 --> 04:34.633
and I’m having
all my friends say hello.

04:34.666 --> 04:36.433
Oh, Balki, don’t worry.

04:36.466 --> 04:38.433
I’ve been working
with a therapist.

04:38.466 --> 04:41.266
He taught me a way
to overcome my fear of cameras.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.266
It’s a new
Russian technique.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.400
I would love to say
hello to your mama.

04:46.433 --> 04:47.533
Okay.

04:48.766 --> 04:52.433
Mama, I would like you
to meet Ms. Lydia.

04:52.466 --> 04:55.500
She’s the Chronicle’s
advice columnist.

04:55.533 --> 04:57.433
Whenever you’re ready, babe.

04:58.333 --> 05:01.000
Hello, Mrs. Bartokomous.

05:03.433 --> 05:06.766
You have a fine son.
It’s a pleasure knowing him.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.533
Do you need
anything else, Balki?

05:16.066 --> 05:18.000
That’ll do it.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.766
See you later, boys.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.000
You were very good.
Thank you.

05:31.433 --> 05:34.666
Okay, Mama,
time to watch me work.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.033
Excuse me, Balki.

05:49.066 --> 05:51.766
The film you’re making,
is going to give

05:51.800 --> 05:55.333
your mama whiplash
and motion sickness.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.266
Uh‐oh, that’s what
happened when she rented

05:59.300 --> 06:02.533
Jaws 3‐D and forgot
to wear the glasses.

06:04.166 --> 06:06.100
Excuse us, Mama.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.700
You know,
I could help you.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.233
I have some experience
in filmmaking.

06:12.266 --> 06:13.366
You do?

06:13.400 --> 06:15.300
I was audio‐visual monitor

06:15.333 --> 06:17.700
in grade school
for five years.

06:20.566 --> 06:24.633
Well, you live with someone,
you think you know them.

06:24.666 --> 06:27.300
I’m sure we could make a film
that would make your mama

06:27.333 --> 06:29.266
the proudest woman
at the reunion.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.733
Well, cousin,
that was my goal.

06:30.766 --> 06:31.666
I think
we share a vision.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.500
And we could make
that vision a reality.

06:34.533 --> 06:36.266
That is
if you want my help.

06:36.300 --> 06:39.533
Oh, I do! I do! I do.
What, what,
what do we do first?

06:39.566 --> 06:42.666
Well, the first thing
we’re gonna do is

06:42.700 --> 06:44.400
get a tape
for this thing.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.600
Wow!

06:50.133 --> 06:52.233
You are good.

06:56.766 --> 06:58.600

07:01.300 --> 07:03.733
LARRY: Okay, here we go.

07:03.766 --> 07:08.200
"A Day In The Life
Of Balki Bartokomous."

07:08.233 --> 07:10.533
Are you ready?
Yeah, I’m ready.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.033
Good morning, Mama.

07:17.066 --> 07:19.033
(KISSING)

07:19.066 --> 07:21.066
Okay, I just, I want
to show you the kitchen.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.200
Mama, you won’t believe
the things we have in here.

07:23.233 --> 07:25.233
Cut! Stop.
What are you doing?

07:25.266 --> 07:27.133
I’m showing
Mama the kitchen.

07:27.166 --> 07:28.166
Balki, this is
the breakfast scene.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.633
You’re supposed to come in,
grab your cereal

07:29.666 --> 07:31.166
sit down,
and have breakfast.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.566
Did you look
at the script?

07:34.800 --> 07:37.566
Yeah, where is the part
where I show Mama the kitchen?

07:37.600 --> 07:40.466
I cut that part,
we were running long.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.533
But I like the part
where I show Mama the kitchen.

07:42.566 --> 07:44.200
Balki, it doesn’t move
the story.

07:44.233 --> 07:48.166
But I like the part
where I show Mama
the kitchen.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.233
Okay, we’ll shoot it
and deal with it in editing.

07:51.266 --> 07:53.600
Okay, uh,
take it from...

07:53.633 --> 07:55.133
"This is our kitchen."

07:55.166 --> 07:57.133
Give me a minute.

08:01.366 --> 08:03.066
This is our kitchen.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.033
And, Mama,
you just wouldn’t believe

08:05.066 --> 08:06.533
the things
we have in here.

08:06.566 --> 08:10.366
Right in this room,
inside our apartment,
we have...

08:11.066 --> 08:15.766
Fire. Water.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.500
And you better sit down
for this one, Mama...

08:20.133 --> 08:22.433
Winter in a box!

08:23.566 --> 08:25.133
If you had
one of these

08:25.166 --> 08:26.666
you wouldn’t have
to take your frozen foods

08:26.700 --> 08:29.600
to the top
of Mount Mypos.

08:29.633 --> 08:32.466
Well, I guess,
I’ll have my breakfast now.

08:35.732 --> 08:38.265
Cut! Hold it.
No, no, no.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.332
The cereal’s no good.
Let’s go with the bran.

08:42.366 --> 08:46.366
But, cousin, I always eat
Sugar Booms on Saturday.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.500
Balki, do you want your mama to
think you always have a cereal

08:48.533 --> 08:50.800
loaded with sugar, and lacking
in nutritional value?

08:50.833 --> 08:53.600
Well, I‐‐
Don’t you eat bran sometimes?

08:53.633 --> 08:57.800
Well, I, I, I eat bran
on Mondays, Wednesdays

08:57.833 --> 09:01.700
and on any day when
I feel a bit sluggish.

09:09.233 --> 09:11.200
Well, let’s pretend
it’s Monday or Wednesday

09:11.233 --> 09:14.100
or a day you feel
a bit sluggish.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.533
Pretending?
Ain’t that lying?

09:18.566 --> 09:22.500
No, no,
we are making a movie.

09:22.533 --> 09:25.166
We’re filming the highlights
of your day, any day.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.400
Could be yesterday,
it could be today,
it could be tomorrow.

09:28.433 --> 09:30.600
It will be tomorrow
at the rate we’re going.

09:32.766 --> 09:34.500
The important thing
is to capture

09:34.533 --> 09:38.166
the essence of your life.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.600
And that’s not lying?
No, no, it’s filmmaking.

09:41.633 --> 09:43.266
You take
a seed of truth,

09:43.300 --> 09:45.033
fertilize it
with your imagination,

09:45.066 --> 09:47.433
water it with
exaggeration, and voila!

09:47.466 --> 09:48.700
Docudrama!

09:50.033 --> 09:54.500
You mean, like,
<i>Saturday Night</i>
<i>with Connie Chung?</i>

09:54.533 --> 09:57.033
Exactly. All right, come on.
Here we go, here we go.

09:57.066 --> 09:58.333
Over here, all right.

09:58.366 --> 09:59.733
And we’re gonna go
with the bran.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.600
All right, now just
show your mama

10:01.633 --> 10:05.200
how you eat a nice,
nutritious breakfast.

10:15.733 --> 10:16.666
Cut!

10:16.700 --> 10:19.033
Cousin, I,
I didn’t finish my breakfast.

10:19.066 --> 10:20.133
We got enough
of the breakfast scene.

10:20.166 --> 10:23.400
Okay, now, later on
this evening, I’ve arranged

10:23.433 --> 10:25.100
a little get‐together
here at the apartment.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.133
Instead of going
out to film

10:26.166 --> 10:28.533
all the people you know,
they’ll come here.

10:28.566 --> 10:31.200
And think of the artistic
statement it will make.

10:31.233 --> 10:33.433
Our party,
here in America,

10:33.466 --> 10:37.266
sending our film
to their party in Mypos.

10:37.300 --> 10:41.033
I see it,
and I love it!

10:44.833 --> 10:47.100
But, cousin,
I’d better change my shoes

10:47.133 --> 10:49.400
so that Mama can see me
in the new boots
she just sent me.

10:49.433 --> 10:50.766
Yes, yes, good,
change the shoes

10:50.800 --> 10:53.233
and let’s lose the vest.
It’s kind of busy.

10:53.266 --> 10:56.500
And, you know,
I see the character of Balki

10:56.533 --> 10:58.400
in a pale blue shirt.

11:01.666 --> 11:05.466
Cousin, Balki Bartokomous
wears vests.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.533
Now, on this point,
I’m going to have

11:07.566 --> 11:10.266
to put my foot down
on your face.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.633
I want this film
to be truthful.

11:16.666 --> 11:19.133
Hey, we’re on
the same side on this one.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.466
Go with the vest.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.033
If there’s one thing I want
this film to be, it’s truthful.

11:23.066 --> 11:24.166
Thank you, cousin.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.600
Yeah, hello, Don?
Uh, Larry Appleton.

11:32.633 --> 11:34.766
Yes, I just wanted to confirm
I’ve got 10 actors

11:34.800 --> 11:37.800
from your theater group for the
film I’m shooting this evening.

11:37.833 --> 11:39.600
Yeah, now,
they will be playing

11:39.633 --> 11:42.466
the star’s closest friends
in a party scene.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.300
So, I want them
to dress accordingly.

11:44.333 --> 11:47.033
I want this film
to be truthful.

11:53.666 --> 11:56.200
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

12:01.800 --> 12:05.066
Okay, everybody,
listen up, quiet people.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.500
I want to go over this
one more time.

12:07.533 --> 12:11.433
Now, we’re going to do
the party sequence.

12:11.466 --> 12:12.633
Now, we’re going
to surprise Balki

12:12.666 --> 12:14.466
because he’s not
expecting anybody

12:14.500 --> 12:16.100
till much later.

12:16.133 --> 12:17.800
I hear someone coming.
Okay, here we go.

12:17.833 --> 12:20.700
We’ve only got one shot at it.
Let’s really nail it.

12:20.733 --> 12:22.566
Ready?

12:22.600 --> 12:23.700
Action.

12:23.733 --> 12:25.266
ALL: Surprise!

12:26.166 --> 12:27.433
Oh, my gosh.

12:27.466 --> 12:29.366
Cut!

12:29.400 --> 12:31.233
Uh, a surprise party for me?

12:31.266 --> 12:33.500
I, I never even suspected.

12:33.533 --> 12:36.000
Thank you, Larry.
Thank you, Jennifer.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.733
Mary Anne,
the party’s not for you.

12:40.766 --> 12:42.466
It’s for Balki, remember?

12:43.500 --> 12:44.533
Oh, right.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.066
Come in. Come in.

12:53.733 --> 12:56.566
Larry, who are
all these people?

12:56.600 --> 12:58.366
Oh, they’re actors from
the neighborhood players.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.466
I hired them to be in the film.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.100
Well, why wouldn’t you
just use Balki’s friends?

13:03.133 --> 13:05.033
Well, I’m going
for a real festive look here

13:05.066 --> 13:06.600
and Balki’s friends
just don’t...

13:06.633 --> 13:08.066
(SNAPS FINGERS)
...pop on film.

13:09.566 --> 13:11.600
Well, thanks a lot.

13:11.633 --> 13:13.600
No, not you, you’re here.
You pop.

13:14.766 --> 13:15.800
You pop, too,
Mary Anne.

13:15.833 --> 13:17.166
(SNAPS FINGERS)

13:17.633 --> 13:19.333
Thanks, I try.

13:21.766 --> 13:24.133
Larry, don’t you think
you should’ve asked Balki

13:24.166 --> 13:26.133
before you did all this?

13:26.166 --> 13:28.400
Jennifer, Balki asked me
to make this film for him.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.566
And I am going to make this
the best film Mypos ever saw.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.066
It may be Balki’s life,
but it’s my film.

13:34.566 --> 13:35.633
He’s coming.

13:35.666 --> 13:36.766
Okay, all right.
Over here.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.133
All right, come on,
everybody.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.566
Now, when he comes
through the door

13:39.600 --> 13:40.766
I want to see "surprise!"

13:40.800 --> 13:42.166
I want to see warmth!

13:42.200 --> 13:43.300
I want to see a lot of emotion.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.566
Remember, you love this guy.

13:46.466 --> 13:47.500
Okay.

13:47.533 --> 13:49.133
Ready?

13:49.166 --> 13:50.233
Action!

13:50.266 --> 13:52.200
ALL: Surprise!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.700
Great, hold the look,
hold the look.

13:55.733 --> 13:58.333
Good, good. Cross over here.
Cross over here.

13:58.366 --> 13:59.500
Big hug!

14:02.600 --> 14:04.633
Say something.

14:04.666 --> 14:06.033
Who are you?

14:07.766 --> 14:09.533
Okay, good. Cross over here.
Cross over here.

14:09.566 --> 14:12.366
Good!
You are so surprised!

14:13.666 --> 14:15.533
You’re happy,
You’re happy.

14:15.566 --> 14:17.066
Choke back a tear
if you can.

14:17.100 --> 14:20.166
Yeah, good, good.

14:20.666 --> 14:22.133
Hi, Balki!

14:26.733 --> 14:28.533
No. No, no, no.
Come on.

14:30.266 --> 14:31.366
Cross back over here.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.100
Cross back over here.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.500
Cousin, cousin,
who, who are all these people?

14:35.533 --> 14:37.366
They’re all your friends.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.766
You love them so much.

14:41.100 --> 14:44.100
Well, I recognize those two.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.100
Good. Okay, now,
cross over here.
Cross over here.

14:46.133 --> 14:48.600
Oh, and look who it is.
It’s Mr. Gorpley!

14:48.633 --> 14:50.200
Big reaction!
Big reaction!

14:50.233 --> 14:53.066
Big, big, big, big!
Okay, all right.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.266
Mr. Gorpley,
is there anything

14:54.300 --> 14:56.266
you’d like to say
to Balki’s mama?

14:56.300 --> 14:58.500
Balki is a real swell guy.
What’s for dessert?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.600
Terrific.
Okay, Balki, Balki.

15:01.633 --> 15:02.533
Cross over here.
Wait a minute

15:02.566 --> 15:03.433
I want to say thank you
to Mr. Gorpley‐‐

15:03.466 --> 15:04.433
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

15:04.466 --> 15:07.233
You can do that
when we do the warm scene later.

15:07.266 --> 15:09.133
Cross over here.
Come on, yeah...

15:09.166 --> 15:12.466
Oh! And look who it is,
it’s Ms. Lydia from work.

15:15.466 --> 15:17.066
Hi, Mrs. Bartokomous.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.066
I’m Lydia Markham.

15:21.266 --> 15:24.266
And I’m so happy and proud
to be here at this party

15:24.300 --> 15:28.000
to honor
my best friend Bilki.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.566
All of us
at the Chronicle love Bilki.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.200
He’s such a joy to be around.

15:35.233 --> 15:37.633
And Bilki
is such a hard worker.

15:41.466 --> 15:42.533
Ms. Lydia?

15:42.566 --> 15:45.600
Have you done something
different with your hair?

15:47.833 --> 15:49.233
Do I have
another line here?

15:49.266 --> 15:51.666
I mean,
is he supposed to say that?

15:51.700 --> 15:55.566
Cousin, could I,
could I have a word with you?

15:55.600 --> 15:58.033
Okay, Cut!
Hold your places, people.

16:01.533 --> 16:05.266
I’m pretty sure,
that isn’t Ms. Lydia.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.700
Of course it’s not
Ms. Lydia.

16:10.733 --> 16:12.666
Ms. Lydia talks to her hand.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.500
Your mama doesn’t
want to see that.

16:16.533 --> 16:18.266
I got an actress
to play Lydia.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.233
But Mama will think
that is Ms. Lydia.

16:20.266 --> 16:21.800
So what? It happens
in the movies all the time.

16:21.833 --> 16:24.500
They always get an actor
to play a real life person.

16:24.533 --> 16:27.566
Oh, and I suppose
Crocodile Dundee
was some actor?

16:31.300 --> 16:33.733
Balki, buddy,
Ms. Lydia wanted to be here.

16:33.766 --> 16:36.300
She even wrote the words
the actress is saying,

16:36.333 --> 16:38.266
but remember,
we are trying to capture

16:38.300 --> 16:40.633
the essence of your life.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.233
Yeah, but, but cousin‐‐
We’ll talk about it later.

16:42.266 --> 16:43.500
Come on, we’re losing
the energy of the scene.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.733
Okay, Jennifer, Mary Anne,
are you ready?

16:45.766 --> 16:48.166
Jennifer, why don’t you start.
Okay, Balki, ready?

16:48.633 --> 16:49.666
Action!

16:53.200 --> 16:56.400
Mrs. Bartokomous, you must be
very proud of your son.

16:56.433 --> 17:00.133
He’s kind and generous
and loving and I’m glad‐‐

17:00.166 --> 17:01.566
LARRY: Cut!

17:01.600 --> 17:05.200
Cousin, why you did stop her?
She was on a roll.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.599
Jennifer, that doesn’t sound
like the script I gave you.

17:07.633 --> 17:09.599
Well, Mary Anne
and I thought
it would be nicer

17:09.633 --> 17:11.800
if we say
what we really feel.

17:11.833 --> 17:14.665
I’m not paying you
to say what you feel.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.333
You’re not paying us at all.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.500
Okay, all right,
uh, ladies, uh...

17:20.532 --> 17:24.300
Let me, let me explain
a basic fact of filmmaking.

17:24.333 --> 17:26.566
I am the director.
You are the actresses.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.100
My job is to tell you
what to do.

17:29.133 --> 17:31.400
Your job is to do it.

17:31.433 --> 17:33.666
Okay,
now let’s take it again.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.400
I’m going to get him.
No, no, Jennifer, Jennifer.

17:36.433 --> 17:38.400
Cousin, I need to talk to you
for a moment in the kitchen.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.800
Balki, sit down,
let’s finish this up.

17:39.833 --> 17:41.600
Cousin, now.

17:43.300 --> 17:44.733
Okay, now.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.566
Make it quick,
these people have to do

17:49.600 --> 17:52.233
Fiddler on the Roof
in 20 minutes.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.266
Cousin, you were rude
to Jennifer and Mary Anne.

17:58.300 --> 18:01.100
Balki, buddy, babe,
a little spat
over creative differences.

18:01.133 --> 18:03.433
We’ll make up
at the cast party.

18:03.466 --> 18:06.066
Cousin, I agree with Jennifer.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.666
Why you don’t let them
say what they feel

18:07.700 --> 18:09.600
instead of what you
make up for them?

18:09.633 --> 18:11.666
Balki, everyone has
to follow my script

18:11.700 --> 18:15.300
if we’re going to capture
the essence of your life.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.766
Cousin,
this film is becoming

18:17.800 --> 18:20.433
a pain in my essence.

18:23.533 --> 18:26.400
Now, now, now, first, you,
you bring in a lot of people

18:26.433 --> 18:28.500
who I don’t even know.

18:28.533 --> 18:31.166
And then you hire
an actress to play Ms. Lydia

18:31.200 --> 18:33.700
and don’t think
I didn’t notice
the difference in height.

18:35.633 --> 18:39.533
But, cousin, the straw that
broke Glen Campbell’s back...

18:41.733 --> 18:43.666
Is that you wouldn’t let
Jennifer and Mary Anne

18:43.700 --> 18:45.566
speak from their hearts.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.533
This is not my life.

18:48.566 --> 18:51.366
This is something
you are making up

18:51.400 --> 18:54.466
and I don’t want
to do it anymore.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.500
What?

18:57.533 --> 19:00.000
Cousin, read my lips.

19:01.166 --> 19:05.200
It’s over, finished,
kaputiki.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.533
So what are you saying?

19:15.466 --> 19:17.566
You’re off the picture.

to meet Jennifer.

Cousin Larry’s girlfriend.

Mary Anne.

Okay, go.

19:48.433 --> 19:50.666
Mrs. Bartokomous,
I just want to say

19:50.700 --> 19:53.200
how glad I am
I met your son.

19:53.233 --> 19:56.233
He has a very special place
in my heart.

19:56.266 --> 19:59.200
Thank you so much
for letting him
come to America.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.300
Bye.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.200
Wow.

20:14.233 --> 20:16.666
Well, Mama, um,
that about wraps it up.

20:16.700 --> 20:20.066
I hope everyone’s having
a great time at the reunion.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.366
Mama, I wish I could
be there with you.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.100
You could tell me
everything that’s happened

20:24.133 --> 20:26.433
since the last time
I was on Mypos.

20:26.466 --> 20:29.100
I wish we could go walking
in your garden again.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.500
We could go and,
and sit under the olive tree

20:31.533 --> 20:33.366
and watch the sunset

20:33.400 --> 20:36.766
and spit pits for distance.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.466
Well, maybe I’ll see you
at the next reunion, okay?

20:41.100 --> 20:42.166
Bye‐bye, Mama.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.266
Oh, Balki,
that was beautiful.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.666
Yeah, it was.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.266
Oh, Larry, hi. Um...

20:54.300 --> 20:55.666
Well, it’s getting late.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.700
Uh, you two
probably want to talk.

20:57.733 --> 20:58.766
Right.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.033
We’ll come back
in the morning

21:00.066 --> 21:01.333
and help you clean up.

21:01.366 --> 21:03.433
You know, I don’t know what
Lydia’s been doing to herself,

21:03.466 --> 21:04.766
but she sure looks fabulous.

21:11.733 --> 21:14.100
I saw a little bit
of your, uh, film.

21:15.766 --> 21:18.366
Looks good.
Thank you, cousin.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.300
You know my only regret
is that I don’t
have my closest

21:21.333 --> 21:23.333
and dearest friend
in the whole world in it

21:23.366 --> 21:25.066
so that Mama
could meet him.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.366
Well, I wish I could
have been in it.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.333
Well, I still
have the camera.

everyone...

21:45.100 --> 21:48.333
Uh... Uh...

21:48.366 --> 21:50.033
Cousin,
just say what you feel.

21:50.066 --> 21:52.433
They’re your family,
too. Go ahead.

21:55.666 --> 21:58.800
I know you’re all sad
because Balki’s not there

21:58.833 --> 22:00.800
and I know you miss him.

22:00.833 --> 22:04.166
I, I know because,
uh, I’d miss him, too

22:04.200 --> 22:06.466
if he weren’t here.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.500
He’s my best friend.

And don’t worry
about him because

22:09.666 --> 22:12.333
he’s doing fine
here in America.

22:12.366 --> 22:14.533
I’ll look out for him.
