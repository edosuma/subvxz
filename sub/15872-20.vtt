00:01.542 --> 00:04.375
[Emma]  A few months ago,
I discovered I had
a twin sister

00:04.375 --> 00:07.291
and then she asked me
to take her place.

00:07.291 --> 00:10.875
Keep the secret,
find our real mother
and try to stay alive.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.667
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:13.667 --> 00:15.875
How long could you keep up
the lying game?

00:17.542 --> 00:19.834
[Alec] What is it?

00:19.834 --> 00:21.333
It's just if that picture
gets into the wrong hands,

00:21.333 --> 00:22.625
this is how it's gonna end?

00:22.625 --> 00:25.208
-I might have a solution.
-Okay.

00:25.208 --> 00:26.834
We have something
to share with you.

00:26.834 --> 00:28.458
We're getting married.

00:28.458 --> 00:30.166
[Thayer] It looks
like my dad's guilt
comes down

00:30.166 --> 00:31.792
to whether Rebecca was
telling the truth

00:31.792 --> 00:33.708
about where he was the night
of Derek's murder.

00:33.708 --> 00:35.667
We start doing some digging
on Rebecca.

00:35.667 --> 00:39.000
The love of her life
was always in Phoenix.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.917
But, you know,
she always had
a photograph of his

00:40.917 --> 00:42.708
in a locket around her neck.

00:42.708 --> 00:44.208
Oh, my God.

00:44.208 --> 00:45.959
Did you sleep with Rebecca?

00:45.959 --> 00:49.166
[laughs] No.
Why are you
bringing this up again?

00:49.166 --> 00:51.583
Because every time I do,
you shut me down.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.708
-I'm sorry. I can't.
-Why?

00:54.708 --> 00:57.208
I kissed Sutton.
But it's over now.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.458
There's always gonna be a part
of you that wishes

00:59.458 --> 01:01.458
that you could be with her.

What do you want me to do?

01:45.625 --> 01:47.125
I don't know. I...

01:48.917 --> 01:52.083
Just... Move on.

01:52.083 --> 01:55.208
No. I'm not letting you go.

01:55.208 --> 01:57.000
Is that why you waited
until we were half-naked

01:57.000 --> 01:58.917
in a motel room to tell me

01:58.917 --> 02:00.500
that you were still
into Sutton?

02:00.500 --> 02:02.083
I'm not.
And that's not what I said.

02:02.083 --> 02:04.125
No. You said,

02:05.792 --> 02:07.458
"It's complicated."

02:07.458 --> 02:08.542
I'm sorry.

02:09.542 --> 02:11.375
I promise this will
never happen again.

02:12.792 --> 02:14.291
How do you know that?

02:14.291 --> 02:16.792
I just do. All right?

02:16.792 --> 02:17.959
Tell me how
I can prove it to you.

02:18.792 --> 02:20.667
Ethan, that...

02:24.834 --> 02:26.125
That night at the motel,

02:26.125 --> 02:29.166
that was gonna
be my first time.

02:29.166 --> 02:31.083
I know.
That's why I said something.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.500
I wanna be honest with you.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.083
The problem is,

02:39.166 --> 02:41.000
the truth really hurts.

02:42.583 --> 02:43.917

-Honey, what happened?

03:16.792 --> 03:18.166
You left so early.

03:18.166 --> 03:20.250
Sorry, I just needed
to clear my head.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.291
Of what? What's going on?

03:22.333 --> 03:24.500
-Nothing.
-It's probably my fault.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.917
The trip to Coachella
was a bust.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.000
-Ethan and I broke up.
-What?

03:32.125 --> 03:33.708
When? How...

03:33.708 --> 03:35.917
How is that even possible?
You were away.

03:36.625 --> 03:38.125
He came with us.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.875
[Ted] On an overnight trip

03:40.875 --> 03:42.750
when you were supposed
to be chaperoning your
younger sister?

03:42.750 --> 03:44.208
I know. I'm sorry.

03:44.208 --> 03:45.750
I shouldn't have...

03:47.708 --> 03:49.417
I shouldn't have
asked him to come.

03:49.417 --> 03:51.000
And I shouldn't...

03:52.250 --> 03:53.625
[sighs] I'm sorry.

03:55.708 --> 03:56.959
Honey, wait.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.041
[sobs]

04:05.250 --> 04:06.125
Come here, sweetie.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.625
Oh, sweetie.

04:08.625 --> 04:10.208
I'm so sorry.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.583
No.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.625
I'm sorry.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.000
You have so much
on your plate.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.250
I was wrong about that.

04:20.083 --> 04:22.125
I just...
I dragged you into that.

04:22.125 --> 04:24.834
I shouldn't have done that.
Listen to me. I was wrong.

04:24.834 --> 04:27.542
Your father and Rebecca,
there was no affair.

04:27.542 --> 04:29.250
Nothing...

04:29.250 --> 04:31.250
-Nothing happened.
-Oh, thank God.

04:31.250 --> 04:33.250
It doesn't matter.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.125
You are what's important.

04:35.125 --> 04:37.583
How could Ethan do this?

04:37.583 --> 04:39.166
You stood by him
when he was in jail.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.667
You never doubted him.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.625
Ethan has feelings
for someone else.

05:00.291 --> 05:02.542
So, I'm thinking the archway
will be here.

05:02.542 --> 05:04.458
-Massive flowers.
-"Massive"?

05:04.458 --> 05:06.792
-You mean, like, big?
-Peonies.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.417
-Are they even in season?
-I don't know.

05:08.417 --> 05:10.375
We'd put dogwood
on each side...

05:10.375 --> 05:12.125
And you're putting this
together in a day?

05:12.125 --> 05:13.625
Well, it's the day
after tomorrow,

05:13.625 --> 05:15.834
so technically that's
two days, but still.

05:15.834 --> 05:18.125
[Rebecca] Okay, fine, daisies.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.250
Roses, whatever,
but I will need a dress.

05:21.250 --> 05:24.250
Maybe not a Vera Wang,
since it's not my
first trip down the aisle.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.625
And I'll need a maid of honor.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.041
-Mads?
-Oh, my God, really?

05:30.458 --> 05:32.959
Oh, that's so sweet.
Well, that means
I need a new dress, too, Dad.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.375
Whatever my girls want,
they get.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.417
I'll need a best man.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.667
What do you think, Thayer?

05:40.667 --> 05:43.000
Uh, honestly?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.375
I... I think it's
a little sudden.

05:45.583 --> 05:46.834
But, you know,
not that I'm not thrilled.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.375
It's just, you know,
what's the rush?

05:48.375 --> 05:50.375
"What's the rush?" Love.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.917
Makes you do
crazy things.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.500
Like, not wait around
for the rest of your life
to start. Huh?

05:55.500 --> 05:57.041
Yes.

05:57.041 --> 05:58.333
[chuckling]

06:03.542 --> 06:05.625
My mom must be
devastated, right?

06:05.625 --> 06:07.250
Just leave.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.875
I saw you guys
hugging and crying.

06:10.291 --> 06:11.333
Hmm.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.458
Must be about
Rebecca and my dad.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.875
-And the affair?
-No, it didn't happen.

06:16.875 --> 06:18.708
Kristin talked to Ted.

06:18.708 --> 06:21.041
He said there was no affair.

06:21.041 --> 06:23.417
Well, either Rebecca
is a crazy stalker

06:23.417 --> 06:24.708
or my dad is lying.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.083
It's Rebecca's.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.208
I snuck into her house
last night and stole it.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.750
-Sutton...
-Just open it.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.959
Why does Rebecca
have a picture of Ted?

06:41.959 --> 06:43.792
I told you when I met you,

06:43.792 --> 06:46.667
I thought my dad was lying
about something.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.875
This is just the beginning,
I can feel it.

06:50.625 --> 06:54.208
I think you should
show that to Kristin.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.917
Me?

06:55.917 --> 06:57.500
Well, don't you think
she deserves to know?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.250
And besides, I think that
maybe she could help us

06:59.250 --> 07:00.250
figure everything out.

07:01.458 --> 07:02.917
Come on, you guys
have gotten close.

07:02.917 --> 07:05.250
I'm sure you'll find
the right thing to say.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.417
I really don't think
there is a right
way to say this.

07:11.083 --> 07:14.125
Wait, so if Kristin

07:14.125 --> 07:16.000
wasn't the one crying,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.125
then... What?

07:20.125 --> 07:21.458
Ethan and I broke up.

07:22.041 --> 07:25.250
What? Why?

07:25.250 --> 07:27.458
[scoffs] Oh, like you
really don't know why.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.500
He told me what happened
at the ranch.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.250
How you guys...

07:34.250 --> 07:35.500
Hmm.

07:36.792 --> 07:39.458
Oh, my God,
what is happening to me?

07:39.458 --> 07:40.834
I actually feel bad for you.

07:41.792 --> 07:44.125
I'm sure it'll pass.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.208
Just enough time for you
to go over to the trailer

07:46.208 --> 07:47.250
and throw yourself at him,

07:48.125 --> 07:49.458
again.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.041
So what if I do?

07:51.875 --> 07:53.250
You guys are broken up, right?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.250
[mutters] Sutton,
leave me alone.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.250
[Thayer] "Maid of honor"?
What are you doing?

08:00.250 --> 08:01.959
Last night we were about to
accuse our father...

08:01.959 --> 08:03.708
Of murder. I know.
Thank God it never
got that far.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.708
I can't believe I ever
listened to you guys.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.000
-I never believed it.
-Mads.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.667
We talked to Jesse,
that frat guy.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.041
Thayer, you saw Dad.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.959
He's in love,
all kisses and smiles.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.625
If he's acting like that after
he murdered someone,

08:15.625 --> 08:16.959
he's not just a criminal,
he's a psychopath.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.750
Hey, I'm just looking
at the facts.

08:18.750 --> 08:21.250
And so am I, and the fact is
I've never seen Dad
this happy,

08:21.250 --> 08:22.750
not even with Mom.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.166
Well, then you're forgetting,
Mom was the love of his life.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.834
And how miserable
has he been since she left?

08:27.834 --> 08:30.125
And what did he do?
He took it out on us,
but not lately.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.959
Okay, that still doesn't
explain the eyewitness.

08:31.959 --> 08:33.542
-Why can't you see that?
-Because he's our father!

08:33.542 --> 08:35.250
And you have no proof!

08:35.250 --> 08:36.125
You have nothing!

08:38.458 --> 08:40.583
You and Dad had been
screwed up for a long time now

08:40.583 --> 08:42.333
and this is your big chance
to screw him right back.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.875
No, Mads, no.
[stammers] It's Rebecca,

08:44.875 --> 08:46.500
it's the wedding,
it's too fast.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.667
I know it's fast,
but I don't care!

08:48.667 --> 08:51.000
Dad's happy.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.250
For once,
can't you just let him be?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.333
[Sutton] It's so hot.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.875
-Sutton...
-What?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.959
I'm just stating the obvious.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.166
And you, my friend,

09:06.166 --> 09:08.792
are a giant
neon sign of sexy
right now.

09:11.834 --> 09:14.625
-What are you doing here?
-I just talked to Emma.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.834
Poor girl.
She is really suffering.

09:17.834 --> 09:20.166
But you know what,
I am so glad that you finally

09:20.166 --> 09:22.000
were honest with her.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.291
This is none
of your business.

09:23.291 --> 09:25.000
Isn't it, though?

09:25.000 --> 09:28.625
I mean, everything
that happened with us
at the ranch.

09:28.625 --> 09:30.917
I know we didn't actually
sleep together, but...

09:32.375 --> 09:34.417
I mean, you can't deny
that our connection was real.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.667
Whatever connection we had,

09:38.667 --> 09:40.583
it disappeared the second
you got home and turned back

09:40.583 --> 09:42.000
into the lying bitch
you've always been.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.625
Ouch.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.875
That connection?
Those feelings?

09:47.583 --> 09:49.083
They're gone.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.917
And they're never coming back.

09:50.917 --> 09:52.375
So you say.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.583
You seem pretty
pissed off for

09:55.583 --> 09:57.000
a guy who doesn't
give a damn, though.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.667
Now, I am a patient girl

09:59.667 --> 10:01.583
and I say that you and me...

10:02.208 --> 10:05.417
We are a big, fat yes.

10:07.417 --> 10:08.625
Just a question of when.

10:15.834 --> 10:18.125
Well, Judge, I do believe
you're correct.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.417
I have my eyes a little
further down the field.

10:20.417 --> 10:22.500
"Governor Rybak"
has a certain ring to it,
doesn't it?

10:22.500 --> 10:23.917
Not bad.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.667
And a beautiful new wife
never hurt a campaign.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.208
-No, sir.
-Aw. [chuckles]

10:27.208 --> 10:28.792
-I'll see you
in a couple of days.
-All right.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.834
My sticks are
always ready, anytime.

10:34.458 --> 10:36.500
-I'm feeling a little nervous.
-Really?

10:36.500 --> 10:38.291
-Yeah.
-Why, you got cold feet
all of a sudden?

10:38.875 --> 10:40.792
No.

10:40.792 --> 10:43.959
-Hardly. Are you?
-No. Not at all.

10:43.959 --> 10:45.708
I'm good. I just wish
my kids were.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.875
Oh, well, I thought
Mads seemed...

10:47.875 --> 10:50.000
No, no, Mads is fine.
It's Thayer giving me
all these speeches

10:50.000 --> 10:51.792
about how we should slow down

10:51.792 --> 10:53.458
and not take things so fast,
you know?

10:53.458 --> 10:55.000
-Hey.
-What?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.375
It's gonna be okay.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.125
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.333
You're safe as long as
the two of us are together.

11:00.333 --> 11:01.792
I like the sound of that.

11:01.792 --> 11:02.834
Alec. Rebecca.

11:03.959 --> 11:05.542
Hi. How are you?

11:05.542 --> 11:07.125
Kristin, hi.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.917
Um, actually,
I'm so glad you're here.

11:08.917 --> 11:11.291
You were on my call list.

11:11.291 --> 11:13.917
But now that
you're here in person,
I can just tell you.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.792
Tell me what?

11:16.792 --> 11:17.875
We're getting married.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.125
Day after tomorrow,

11:20.125 --> 11:21.375
and we would love
for you and Ted to attend.

11:22.125 --> 11:23.041
"Married"?

11:24.542 --> 11:28.166
Wow! I...
I don't know what to say.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.458
-Say you'll be there
to support us, to be there.
-Yeah.

11:32.667 --> 11:33.834
Yes, of course.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.750
Great.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.166
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.417
Um, one second.
Would you excuse me?

11:39.417 --> 11:40.875
-You're always ringing.
-Yeah.

11:41.208 --> 11:42.166
Hello?

11:43.708 --> 11:46.083
Alec's a dear friend, and I...

11:47.458 --> 11:49.375
I'm actually thrilled
he's found someone

11:49.375 --> 11:51.208
to spend the rest
of his life with.

11:51.208 --> 11:54.250
Thank you so much.
It means a lot.

11:54.250 --> 11:57.333
Rebecca, I know
I've been distant

11:57.333 --> 12:00.792
and acting
a little weird lately. I, I...

12:00.792 --> 12:03.875
I want you to know
Ted and I talked
and everything is fine,

12:03.875 --> 12:05.583
so I'm...

12:06.542 --> 12:08.417
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just,
I'm not making sense.

12:09.208 --> 12:10.417
No, no.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.333
I'm just glad
he finally told you.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.417
Finally told me what?

12:22.667 --> 12:23.834
Oh.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.250
I'm so sorry.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.417
I misunderstood, and, um...

12:34.625 --> 12:36.625
Kristin, I really hope
you can make the wedding.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.708
I'm sorry.

12:50.875 --> 12:53.250
Hey. Everything okay?

12:53.250 --> 12:56.000
Yeah. Ethan,
this isn't about you, okay?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.500
-Well, what...
-Mom.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.792
Hey, Emma, wait, please.
Don't walk away from me again.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.625
I just...
I can't do this right now.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.542
-Mom?
-Sweetie, I'm just leaving.

13:08.542 --> 13:09.667
Please, I need to talk to you.
It's important.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.708
Okay.

13:17.542 --> 13:19.667
[Emma] Please just open it.
It's Rebecca's.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.083
Oh, God. Oh, God.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.875
Um, it's an older picture,
though, right?

13:26.875 --> 13:28.333
So, I don't know
what Dad told you.
I...

13:28.333 --> 13:29.542
I shouldn't have
showed it to you.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.667
No, you did the right thing.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.041
I'm so sorry
you're in the middle of this.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.458
No, it's fine.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.375
-Mom?
-I'm sorry, I have to go.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.333
Look, when you were
at the ranch, Dan was
helping us out.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.542
He was on our side,

13:45.542 --> 13:47.250
but don't forget
he has all that history
with my dad.

13:47.250 --> 13:48.959
Well, we have to do something.

13:48.959 --> 13:51.667
I mean, my dad and Rebecca?

13:51.667 --> 13:53.917
Rebecca's hands are dirty.
Alec's hands are dirty.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.083
If the two of them get married

13:56.083 --> 13:58.291
it's like, the bad guys win.

13:58.291 --> 14:01.250
-What are you guys doing?
-We're actually here for them.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.417
Hey. We have to talk to you.

14:05.166 --> 14:06.667
My dad's getting married
in two days

14:06.667 --> 14:08.625
to his only alibi
the night of Derek's murder.

14:08.625 --> 14:09.875
Rebecca?

14:09.875 --> 14:12.542
-Yeah.
-Wow, she works fast.

14:12.542 --> 14:14.375
Well, as much as I'd like
to believe in true love,

14:14.375 --> 14:15.625
something about this
doesn't sound right.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.125
Spousal privilege.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.625
If Alec and Rebecca
are married,

14:18.625 --> 14:21.500
she can't be asked
to testify against him.

14:21.500 --> 14:22.917
I know she's lying
about that night.

14:22.917 --> 14:23.875
Yeah, but it's not just that.

14:25.834 --> 14:29.000
My dad and Rebecca
had an affair.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.083
It was a long time ago,
but I don't trust the woman.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.083
She has secrets.

14:33.083 --> 14:35.166
Why else would this marriage

14:35.166 --> 14:37.375
have to be happening so fast?

14:37.375 --> 14:39.250
It's not just because
of Derek's murder.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.208
[Dan] Listen, you guys got
to knock it off, all right?

14:41.208 --> 14:43.542
You're kids. You're in
way over your head
with this thing.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.500
I'm not a kid. Not anymore.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.375
It doesn't matter.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.166
Just leave this case
for the police.

14:50.166 --> 14:51.417
Trust me, we're working on it.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.458
That's all you need to know.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.458
[Laurel] It's pretty cool,

15:00.458 --> 15:02.708
especially since
she offered to pay us.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.542
I mean, I guess
we don't really have a lot

15:04.542 --> 15:06.417
of  Ode to Joy
in our repertoire, but...

15:07.500 --> 15:09.750
-What's the gig?
-The wedding, duh.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.625
Right, yeah, I heard.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.750
-Maybe Rebecca's pregnant.
-Hey, Laurel.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.458
What? I mean, two days?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.750
You know, the engagement
dinner's tomorrow night.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.625
This is definitely a rush job.

15:21.792 --> 15:25.000
Which means I should probably
get to work.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.125
Let me know
when dinner's ready.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.625
Yeah.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.250
Crazy, right?

15:31.250 --> 15:33.250
But it's great.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.667
I mean, now you can stop
worrying about Rebecca

15:34.667 --> 15:36.333
and all your ideas.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.250
She's marrying
our best friend.

15:38.250 --> 15:39.291
Wedding sounds fun.

15:40.583 --> 15:42.542
It's gonna be a great night
for all of us.

15:53.417 --> 15:54.458
Here you go.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.500
What's going on?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.250
I never should have showed
Kristin the locket.

16:02.417 --> 16:04.125
I just thought
that if it were me...

16:07.500 --> 16:10.250
You know,
the Ethan and Sutton thing...

16:11.625 --> 16:13.208
I just feel like it's all
gonna blow up.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.875
You're right.
It's all hitting at once.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.083
I'm glad you're here.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.166
It's okay.

16:27.708 --> 16:29.667
I'm sorry, I know
that you have this stuff
to deal with...

16:29.667 --> 16:31.458
It's okay.
It's fine, it's fine.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.375
[sniffles]

16:35.583 --> 16:36.708
What?

16:39.458 --> 16:41.125
It's...

16:41.125 --> 16:43.667
You've just been the...
The one bright spot

16:43.667 --> 16:45.291
in all of this.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.750
Sutton, is this really
necessary?

16:55.750 --> 16:57.500
Yes, of course.
I always say, dress the part.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.000
Or in this case,
the situation.

16:59.000 --> 16:59.917
Ooh!

17:02.208 --> 17:03.917
Purple.
We look so good in purple.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.708
Okay, going to this thing
and participating

17:07.708 --> 17:09.250
in this hypocrisy...

17:09.250 --> 17:12.000
Could help uncover the truth
about Rebecca and Alec.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.250
-Especially Alec.
-[door clicks open]

17:13.834 --> 17:14.792
Hi.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.500
Hey, yourself.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.250
-Um, what are you doing here?
-Oh, come on.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.208
Like he hasn't seen
all that and more?

17:24.333 --> 17:26.041
Oh.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.917
Look, I know
Thayer's been on this

17:27.917 --> 17:30.041
but I think I can help

17:30.041 --> 17:31.792
get you guys some answers.

17:31.792 --> 17:34.917
Prove Rebecca's
alibi for Alec is a lie.

17:34.917 --> 17:38.708
Oh, what Emma is saying
with her silence

17:38.708 --> 17:41.375
is that she is dying
to know all the answers

17:41.375 --> 17:43.959
but is just a little unsure
that she wants you involved.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.458
You know what, Sutton?

17:46.458 --> 17:49.375
-I can speak for myself.
-So?

17:49.375 --> 17:52.542
What did you have in mind?
Specifically.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.083
I want to break
into Rebecca's house

17:54.083 --> 17:54.792
while she's at
the engagement dinner.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.667
And maybe find something
that proves

17:57.667 --> 18:00.000
that her alibi is bogus.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.458
I like it.

18:02.166 --> 18:03.250
You're not just good looks.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.041
Emma?

18:06.417 --> 18:07.625
What do you say?

18:13.959 --> 18:15.542
Just don't get caught.

18:26.792 --> 18:27.792
[Kristin] Thank you.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.041
[car door closes]

18:40.417 --> 18:42.333
Are you okay?

18:42.333 --> 18:44.291
-Yeah.
-Come on, let's go.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.792
-What are you doing, Baz?
-Hey, how are you doing?

18:50.792 --> 18:53.500
Oh! Looks like quite a lot
happened on that trip
to Coachella.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.125
Okay, he's not here
as my date.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.583
Rebecca invited him.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.667
-They're very close, you know.
-Sure, okay.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.959
Well, come on, Baz, I'm gonna
buy you a Shirley Temple.

19:01.917 --> 19:04.250
Mom, what's going on?

19:04.250 --> 19:05.959
Did you talk to Dad
about the locket?

19:05.959 --> 19:07.542
I don't want to talk
about that now.

19:07.542 --> 19:08.875
Let's just go inside.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.708
-I got this.
-[man] All right.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.959
Thank you.

19:21.708 --> 19:22.917
I'm sorry about you
and Sutton.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.125
Okay.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.625
Well, for what it's worth,
I just always thought

19:26.625 --> 19:28.875
that you two
were meant to be.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.458
Good night.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.000
[sighs]

19:49.208 --> 19:50.917
[Ted]  Okay, a toast.

19:50.917 --> 19:55.083
Raising a glass
is definitely in order,
my friend.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.708
Actually, as best man,
I believe the first toast
belongs to me.

19:57.708 --> 20:00.041
[Ted] Ah, touche.
Go right ahead.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.917
Here's to love,

20:02.917 --> 20:04.458
when it comes quick
as it did here.

20:06.041 --> 20:08.166
And when it takes
a second or two.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.917
Here's to family.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.583
The ones we're in,
the ones we make.

20:16.917 --> 20:19.625
And...
Here's to future.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.375
I, for one, can't wait
to see what it holds.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.917
-[Ted] Hear, hear.
-Cheers.

20:24.917 --> 20:26.500
[all] Cheers.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Okay.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.375
I got to say, that no one
was more surprised

20:36.375 --> 20:37.792
by the news of this wedding
than me.

20:38.959 --> 20:41.041
But Alec is my best friend.

20:42.625 --> 20:43.667
He's been there for me always.

20:45.917 --> 20:48.792
And all I want is for him
to be happy

20:48.792 --> 20:51.375
with his new bride Rebecca.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.125
And I just hope that they have
the kind of marriage

20:54.125 --> 20:55.291
that Kristin and I have.

21:00.875 --> 21:01.875
I'll go.

21:38.959 --> 21:39.959
[gasps]

21:42.083 --> 21:43.458
What are you doing here?

21:44.291 --> 21:45.667
Thought you could use
the company.

21:56.792 --> 21:57.917
[Sutton] Hmm...

21:58.500 --> 22:00.542
Starting with receipts.

22:00.542 --> 22:01.834
From that place
she got takeout

22:01.834 --> 22:03.583
the night Derek was killed.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.792
Changing the timeline.
Therefore,
disproving her alibi.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.083
Good. Except...

22:08.083 --> 22:10.750
I mean, people throw away
their receipts.

22:10.750 --> 22:11.708
Check the computer.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.834
Yeah. That's a good idea.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.417
All right, here,
you take these.

22:17.417 --> 22:18.625
I'm gonna look
on the computer.

22:18.625 --> 22:19.708
Whatever you say, Sherlock.

22:21.834 --> 22:23.000
[door opens]

22:23.000 --> 22:23.875
[Rebecca] Kristin?

22:24.834 --> 22:25.708
[door closes]

22:26.959 --> 22:28.959
You're obviously upset.
Is there something I can do?

22:31.125 --> 22:32.750
[sighs]
I know what you're thinking.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.083
Do you?

22:37.375 --> 22:38.708
Do you really, Rebecca?

22:41.375 --> 22:42.917
Why is it around here,

22:42.917 --> 22:45.542
the first thing out of
people's mouths is a lie?

22:46.917 --> 22:48.208
Is it our city?

22:49.667 --> 22:50.875
Our families?

22:52.125 --> 22:54.041
Maybe it's the water.

22:57.041 --> 22:59.959
So, yesterday...

23:01.875 --> 23:03.625
I guess I slipped up
when I said that thing

23:03.625 --> 23:05.291
about Ted in L.A.

23:05.291 --> 23:07.458
Oh, I guess...
I guess you did.

23:08.625 --> 23:11.708
Kristin, it was
a long time ago,

23:11.708 --> 23:13.959
and it was brief, it ended.

23:15.375 --> 23:16.917
It was never supposed
to get out. I...

23:16.917 --> 23:18.333
Well, then,
this exonerates you, right?

23:18.333 --> 23:19.500
I mean,
that is why you're here,

23:19.500 --> 23:22.041
so I can somehow absolve you?

23:22.041 --> 23:23.458
You are absolved.

23:25.458 --> 23:26.959
I hate seeing you this way.

23:26.959 --> 23:28.625
Maybe you shouldn't have
come back to town.

23:35.417 --> 23:37.375
Hey, Ted, hey, hey,
hey, listen.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.625
Let's let the women
handle this, okay?

23:38.625 --> 23:40.000
You were supposed
to keep Rebecca in line.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.750
I'm losing my wife, my family.

23:41.750 --> 23:44.083
What, and that's my fault,
or Rebecca's?

23:45.500 --> 23:47.708
Come on, man.
Let's be honest.

23:47.708 --> 23:49.417
You screwed this up
from the outset.

23:49.417 --> 23:51.834
I never should have listened
to you, the lies,
the craziness.

23:51.834 --> 23:54.917
Hey, shut up. We got company.
Just calm down, okay?

23:54.917 --> 23:56.125
-Hey, ladies.
Nothing. Nothing.
-What's going on?

23:56.125 --> 23:57.500
-Where is Mom?
-She's okay.

23:57.500 --> 24:00.083
She just went
to the restroom, um...

24:00.083 --> 24:02.083
Laurel, Sutton,
your mom and dad
need to talk about

24:02.083 --> 24:03.625
a couple things,
let's go to the...

24:03.625 --> 24:04.500
Let's go to the table.

24:05.208 --> 24:06.959
Come on,
I'll walk back with you.

24:08.542 --> 24:10.125
What's going on?
Where's Kristin?

24:10.875 --> 24:12.291
I think she's going home.

24:13.667 --> 24:15.417
Oh, my God. Kristin?

24:15.417 --> 24:17.834
Kristin, please! Please.
You're leaving?

24:17.834 --> 24:20.083
-What does it look like?
-Whatever she said,
whatever Rebecca said...

24:20.083 --> 24:22.500
She has a locket
with a picture of you in it.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.166
Did you know that?
It doesn't matter.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.875
This isn't about the affair.
It's not about Rebecca.

24:26.875 --> 24:28.959
It's about the lies.

24:28.959 --> 24:30.959
You made me think
it was my fault

24:30.959 --> 24:33.625
Justin's mother died
when the whole time...

24:33.625 --> 24:36.041
The whole time it was just
this affair you were having.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.792
What does it feel like, Ted,

24:37.792 --> 24:40.041
building a family
on a mountain of lies?

24:40.041 --> 24:42.458
And what is the view
like from up there?

24:42.458 --> 24:44.542
'Cause I'll tell you what,
from here, the view sucks!

24:46.959 --> 24:48.667
-What is this?
-Honey, uh...

24:50.834 --> 24:53.291
Oh, Sutton. Sutton...

24:53.291 --> 24:55.125
Mom, just tell me
what's going on.

24:55.125 --> 24:58.291
Laurel, I don't want you
taking this on.

24:58.291 --> 25:00.166
-What does that even mean?
-She admitted it?

25:02.291 --> 25:04.917
Just... It doesn't
matter anymore.

25:04.917 --> 25:06.041
Admitted what? What happened?

25:08.083 --> 25:09.375
Somebody tell me.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.542
Dad and Rebecca had an affair.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.708
-A long time ago.
-Sutton, no.

25:17.792 --> 25:19.333
Laurel, listen to me.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.250
Both of you, I want you
to go back in there,

25:21.250 --> 25:23.291
I do not want you
taking sides.

25:23.291 --> 25:25.333
No. No way.
I'm not going back there.
I'm not going.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.375
No, me neither. Come on, Mom,
you can't do this alone.

25:27.375 --> 25:28.291
We're coming home with you.

25:29.792 --> 25:31.208
My babies.

25:35.375 --> 25:37.834
We work really well together.

25:37.834 --> 25:40.000
Make a good team,
don't you think?

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Could you stop doing
that Sutton thing?

25:42.000 --> 25:45.458
Okay. What exactly
is the "Sutton thing"?

25:45.458 --> 25:47.333
Doesn't sound very flattering.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.417
It's not.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.708
Oh, and let me guess,

25:51.708 --> 25:53.792
the Emma thing is all
happiness and light

25:53.792 --> 25:56.125
and sunshine and bright?

25:57.500 --> 25:59.375
Well, she doesn't have to lie
to get what she wants.

25:59.375 --> 26:01.250
Mmm! Deep.

26:02.708 --> 26:05.208
God, this woman
saves every receipt

26:05.208 --> 26:08.417
except for takeout.
How are you doing?

26:08.417 --> 26:10.291
Everything's
password-protected,

26:10.291 --> 26:11.500
and we're running out of time.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.708
What about other files?

26:13.708 --> 26:15.542
We're looking for
something specific.

26:15.542 --> 26:17.208
Yeah, but snooping
is snooping,

26:17.208 --> 26:19.417
and if she doesn't clear
her history, who knows
what we'll find?

26:19.417 --> 26:21.834
Look. Downloads, right there.

26:21.834 --> 26:23.583
You have way too much
experience in this.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.208
No, not that...
Just let me do it.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.333
I...

26:28.667 --> 26:30.750
So, we can check the dates

26:30.750 --> 26:32.667
starting with the night
Derek was murdered,

26:32.667 --> 26:34.000
and then we'll move forward.

26:37.583 --> 26:39.458
[Ethan] Look, there's nothing
here from that night.

26:39.458 --> 26:42.542
Wait. What's this?

26:42.542 --> 26:44.542
It's the only thing downloaded
in the last four days.

26:44.542 --> 26:45.625
A JPEG.

26:47.417 --> 26:48.542
[scoffs]

26:48.542 --> 26:50.000
Oh, man.

26:51.583 --> 26:53.250
Looks like we just hit
the jackpot.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.083
[Rebecca] Oh, my gosh.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.083
[Alec] It's all right.
Just say it to him.

27:04.083 --> 27:05.417
-Think I should just...
-I think it's important.

27:05.417 --> 27:06.542
Go ahead.

27:07.583 --> 27:08.875
Ted?

27:09.625 --> 27:11.166
You should know,
the last thing

27:12.458 --> 27:13.750
I wanted was...

27:16.208 --> 27:18.458
So, what did you want?

27:18.458 --> 27:20.125
I assume Alec here
was the grand prize.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.250
But what about
destroying my life,

27:21.250 --> 27:23.959
my marriage, my family?

27:23.959 --> 27:25.625
What should we call it,
the consolation prize?

27:27.542 --> 27:29.041
She's being honest with you,
man. Give her a chance.

27:31.542 --> 27:34.875
She'll get past this
as soon as she realizes

27:34.875 --> 27:36.667
that what happened between us
was a million years ago.

27:37.500 --> 27:38.834
Hmm.

27:38.834 --> 27:40.667
I know it's not what
you want to hear,

27:41.458 --> 27:42.917
but I am sorry.

27:45.291 --> 27:46.625
I truly am.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.583
Okay?

27:52.917 --> 27:54.875
I'm not helping, so, um...

27:54.875 --> 27:58.333
I'm gonna go.
Have a good evening.

27:58.333 --> 27:59.542
See you at home, okay?

28:00.959 --> 28:03.667
-Why don't you just go, too?
-No.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.208
I mean, sure I'll go,
but you know what?

28:05.208 --> 28:06.834
Why don't you think
about this for a second?

28:06.834 --> 28:09.375
Who had your back
through all of this, okay?

28:10.417 --> 28:11.291
Cleaned up your messes,

28:12.250 --> 28:14.166
covered your tracks,
protected you?

28:14.166 --> 28:16.917
You know what, pal,
why don't you just go
straight to hell?

28:16.917 --> 28:18.917
Everything you ever did for me
just blew up in my face.

28:18.917 --> 28:20.959
You're marrying that woman!

28:20.959 --> 28:22.417
You let her back into my life.

28:22.417 --> 28:24.208
Protecting me? No, you...

28:24.208 --> 28:26.667
You just screwed me.

28:26.667 --> 28:29.667
-Yeah, well, that's one way
to look at it.
-Mmm-hmm.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.625
What is the other way
to look at it?

28:32.458 --> 28:33.750
Glass is still half full.

28:35.375 --> 28:37.458
Kristin still doesn't know
half the secret.

28:48.875 --> 28:50.708
Thank you, Ethan.

28:50.708 --> 28:52.708
You have a good night,
Miss Sewell.

28:52.708 --> 28:53.917
[Rebecca] I will.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.375
I just got your text.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.208
-Where's Sutton?
-Uh, she left with her mom.

29:05.208 --> 29:07.041
There was this huge blowout
between Ted and Kristin.

29:07.041 --> 29:07.917
What's up?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.333
You guys need to see this.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.166
Not you, Riley. Sorry.

29:15.291 --> 29:17.083
It's okay. I get it.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.250
[Ethan] It was on
Rebecca's computer.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.083
Oh, my God.

29:36.917 --> 29:37.959
It doesn't matter
how I got it.

29:38.917 --> 29:41.583
It proves Alec Rybak
killed Derek Rogers.

29:41.583 --> 29:43.458
No. It proves
he was on the scene.

29:43.458 --> 29:45.250
He's holding the murder
weapon in his hand.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.708
No, most likely
the murder weapon,

29:47.708 --> 29:49.875
and I'm guessing that this
photo was obtained illegally,

29:49.875 --> 29:51.750
which makes it
inadmissible in court.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.583
What, are you
defending the guy?

29:53.583 --> 29:55.458
After everything
we've been through?

29:55.458 --> 29:57.208
[Theresa] No, Ethan,
I want to believe it too,

29:57.208 --> 30:00.083
but we need that tire iron,
blood, fingerprints.

30:00.583 --> 30:02.792
DNA, proof!

30:02.792 --> 30:05.291
In other words, if we move
forward too quickly,

30:05.291 --> 30:07.333
instead of it blowing up
in his face, it blows up
in ours, right?

30:07.333 --> 30:08.500
I heard about the photo.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.625
These guys are making it sound
like it's a dead end.

30:14.625 --> 30:17.291
[Theresa] Anything but.
This is a major step.

30:17.291 --> 30:19.375
We're just gonna need
a sympathetic judge.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.166
Someone that's
not in love with Alec.

30:21.166 --> 30:23.083
So that we can get
a search warrant.

30:24.417 --> 30:26.000
We'll see what
we can do, okay?

30:32.041 --> 30:33.667
So you and Sutton found this?

30:34.500 --> 30:37.875
Look, the only reason
I was there

30:37.875 --> 30:39.667
was to help solve this thing.

30:39.667 --> 30:41.708
So you could have a shot
at a family.

30:42.708 --> 30:43.875
And you and I
could have a second chance.

30:45.250 --> 30:47.708
You know what, I don't mean
to sound ungrateful here,

30:49.500 --> 30:51.708
but Sutton is just
always there.

30:53.583 --> 30:57.125
I don't know if it's because
she is one step ahead

30:57.125 --> 30:59.125
or one step behind,
but she is there

30:59.125 --> 31:01.834
and she is in your head,
and under your skin, Ethan.

31:02.583 --> 31:04.458
And it is chronic!

31:05.458 --> 31:07.458
"Chronic"?

31:07.458 --> 31:09.375
-Never goes away.
-Yeah, I know what it means.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.875
[sighs]

31:17.875 --> 31:19.166
Ethan...

31:23.166 --> 31:25.000
You and I are done.

31:30.458 --> 31:31.583
[Alec]
Becca wants me there early.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.125
Listen, guys, before I go,

31:36.125 --> 31:39.417
there's one part
of the ceremony
I want to move up.

31:39.417 --> 31:41.750
The "speak now or forever
hold your peace" bit.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.291
What do we think?

31:50.458 --> 31:51.875
Is the peace gonna hold up?

31:52.500 --> 31:53.458
Yeah, with us.

31:55.291 --> 31:57.041
Maybe not Ted and Kristin.

31:57.041 --> 31:59.667
Maddie, what happened between
Ted and Rebecca was

32:00.708 --> 32:02.542
years and years ago.

32:03.875 --> 32:06.500
Before you were born, and if I
don't have an issue with it...

32:08.417 --> 32:09.708
I don't think
you should, either.

32:11.792 --> 32:13.041
T, what do you think?

32:14.208 --> 32:16.291
Yeah. No issues.

32:19.375 --> 32:20.917
[Alec] Whew! All right.

32:23.625 --> 32:25.250
I'll see you two

32:25.250 --> 32:26.542
at the wedding.

32:27.917 --> 32:29.333
Don't be late.

32:35.125 --> 32:36.458
I can't stand this.

32:36.458 --> 32:37.583
This is horrible!

32:38.750 --> 32:40.708
That picture
and what we know.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.625
I mean, if Dad did kill Derek,

32:42.625 --> 32:45.750
and now he's just marrying
Rebecca to use her
as she's using him...

32:45.750 --> 32:47.834
Mads, I know it's hard,

32:47.834 --> 32:50.542
but just try and hang in there
a little while longer.

32:50.542 --> 32:51.625
We have to see this through.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.959
I know.

32:54.959 --> 32:56.375
Dad spent the night
at the club.

32:59.708 --> 33:01.959
Don't you kids have a wedding
to get ready for?

33:01.959 --> 33:03.917
No. What are you
talking about?

33:03.917 --> 33:05.250
We're not going to that thing.

33:05.792 --> 33:07.083
I mean, right, Sutton?

33:09.375 --> 33:10.959
Uh, of course, not.

33:15.583 --> 33:16.834
Sutton, do you mind
finishing this?

33:21.291 --> 33:23.542
You're not
seriously considering
going to that, are you?

33:24.792 --> 33:26.208
I have to.

33:34.125 --> 33:35.417
Hey.

33:37.417 --> 33:39.083
I kind of figured
you'd be getting all
dressed up

33:39.083 --> 33:40.542
going to that wedding.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.041
Women love weddings, you know.

33:45.667 --> 33:48.041
All that pomp
and romance stuff.

33:50.917 --> 33:52.417
Be a good chance for you to

33:52.417 --> 33:53.542
take another run at her
don't you think?

33:54.291 --> 33:55.542
I'm not going.

33:57.083 --> 33:58.750
I did what I could.

33:58.750 --> 33:59.792
It wasn't enough.

34:00.583 --> 34:01.875
It's never gonna be enough.

34:03.667 --> 34:04.959
I see.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.208
So what are you gonna do?

34:07.708 --> 34:10.583
You gonna sentence
yourself to my life?

34:12.959 --> 34:15.417
And how many years of feeling
sorry for yourself
were you planning there?

34:17.166 --> 34:18.250
Two?

34:19.041 --> 34:20.917
Seven, like me?

34:20.917 --> 34:24.000
I just don't care how this
thing turns out anymore.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.667
You sit there on your ass,
I'll tell you exactly
how it's gonna go.

34:26.667 --> 34:28.417
Thayer's gonna get the girl

34:28.417 --> 34:30.000
and you're gonna get squat.

34:31.250 --> 34:32.875
Trust me, if I were you,

34:33.708 --> 34:35.834
I wouldn't quit
at the finish line, pal.

34:37.667 --> 34:39.458
You'll never forgive yourself.

34:44.375 --> 34:45.792
[Thayer]  Tell Dad
I'll be a little late.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.959
-Thayer, you're the best man.
-I know.

34:47.959 --> 34:50.125
Yeah, best man I know.

34:50.125 --> 34:52.458
Ryan, uh,
I will meet you upstairs.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.792
-Okay. I'll get the car.
-Thanks.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.417
Okay, I am terrified that
people are gonna pick up

35:02.417 --> 35:04.500
on what we're suspecting,
especially Dad.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.875
Just do your best,
I'll handle things here.

35:06.250 --> 35:07.166
Okay.

35:09.917 --> 35:11.625
All right.

35:11.625 --> 35:13.291
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

35:14.667 --> 35:15.792
Get out of here.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.708
-We'll get right to work.
-This way.

35:21.708 --> 35:23.125
[indistinct radio chatter]

35:28.667 --> 35:30.000
[instrumental music playing]

35:32.750 --> 35:33.792
Sutton?

35:35.291 --> 35:36.834
What a pleasant surprise.

35:37.708 --> 35:39.083
I wasn't sure
you were gonna come

35:39.083 --> 35:40.625
after what happened
last night.

35:40.625 --> 35:43.166
Well, I just...

35:43.166 --> 35:45.333
I felt like
I needed to see this.

35:45.333 --> 35:46.917
I'm glad you're here.

35:48.667 --> 35:49.667
How's your mom and dad?

35:51.708 --> 35:53.000
Probably shouldn't
talk about it.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.000
Totally understand.

35:56.708 --> 35:58.667
Do me a favor, darling.

35:58.667 --> 36:00.000
Give 'em some time.

36:01.083 --> 36:02.333
It'll work out.

36:05.125 --> 36:07.041
-Thanks for being here.
-Mmm-hmm.

36:11.667 --> 36:12.875
[doorbell rings]

36:23.333 --> 36:24.250
Hi, kiddo.

36:25.166 --> 36:26.500
Mom doesn't want to see you.

36:28.041 --> 36:30.458
Could you just please
tell her I'm here?

36:30.458 --> 36:32.125
She saw you pull up.
She doesn't want to see you.

36:32.125 --> 36:33.250
It's too soon.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.375
Honey...

36:39.166 --> 36:40.542
I made a mistake.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.583
You have to understand,
you and your sister.

36:44.583 --> 36:46.166
All I know is that

36:46.166 --> 36:48.041
my mom is hurting
really badly right now,

36:48.041 --> 36:49.417
and it's your fault.

36:51.708 --> 36:53.333
I'm sorry, Dad.

37:00.750 --> 37:01.708
[sobs]

37:03.625 --> 37:05.083
[knock on door]

37:06.041 --> 37:07.250
Come in.

37:12.458 --> 37:15.083
Sutton. You're here.

37:16.041 --> 37:17.625
Wonderful.

37:18.208 --> 37:20.208
I know.

37:20.208 --> 37:22.417
Rebecca.
I know all of it, and you...

37:23.667 --> 37:24.834
You can't do this.

37:25.750 --> 37:28.417
Do what, exactly?

37:29.041 --> 37:30.708
Cover for Alec.

37:32.542 --> 37:33.959
I know you've
seen the picture,

37:33.959 --> 37:36.083
and I know
you know the truth,

37:36.083 --> 37:38.458
that Alec killed Derek Rogers.

37:39.875 --> 37:41.959
That photo is an obvious fake.

37:41.959 --> 37:43.667
It's been doctored.

37:43.667 --> 37:44.708
Someone's playing a game.

37:45.417 --> 37:48.083
I always assumed
it was some

37:48.083 --> 37:51.208
malcontent or someone
that Alec sent to jail.

37:52.125 --> 37:54.125
Or Alec

37:54.125 --> 37:56.417
actually killed Derek.

37:56.417 --> 37:58.166
Have you ever thought
about that possibility?

37:58.917 --> 38:00.625
Why would I?

38:00.625 --> 38:03.083
I was with him
that whole night
at his house, remember?

38:03.792 --> 38:06.083
Yes, his alibi.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.125
His wife-to-be.

38:10.125 --> 38:11.875
Is this about your
mother and father?

38:11.875 --> 38:14.125
No, Rebecca, this is
about you coming forward

38:14.125 --> 38:15.291
and telling the truth.

38:16.875 --> 38:18.750
Alec did an awful thing,
and if you marry him

38:18.750 --> 38:20.083
he will get away with it.

38:20.083 --> 38:22.125
So I just want you
to do the right thing

38:22.125 --> 38:23.458
and tell the truth.

38:25.917 --> 38:27.500
Sutton, honey,

38:28.750 --> 38:30.041
I am telling the truth.

38:32.125 --> 38:35.208
Hey, honey, I...
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you were alone.

38:35.208 --> 38:37.458
No, Sutton and I were just
having a little chat.

38:40.291 --> 38:41.291
I'll be right down.

38:42.166 --> 38:43.625
-See you at the altar.
-Okay.

38:49.458 --> 38:50.375
Sutton...

38:51.458 --> 38:52.667
Do me a favor,

38:53.667 --> 38:55.333
hand me my bouquet.

39:10.208 --> 39:11.291
Thayer.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.000
Where you been?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.583
Nearly had to call
for a replacement.

39:16.583 --> 39:18.041
You okay?

39:18.500 --> 39:19.500
Yeah, I'm good.

39:20.458 --> 39:21.291
You don't look okay.

39:23.083 --> 39:24.458
-Yeah, sorry I'm late.
-That's all right. Come on.

39:25.792 --> 39:27.041
[indistinct radio chatter]

39:37.750 --> 39:39.250
Well, his car
is at the wedding,

39:39.250 --> 39:41.708
so if we don't find
anything here,
we could try there.

39:43.041 --> 39:44.000
Let me see those.

39:45.458 --> 39:47.834
I went through the pockets
front and back. Nothing.

39:50.333 --> 39:53.083
So if Alec's
not at the courthouse,
where is he?

39:55.041 --> 39:57.083
-Golf course?
-Exactly.

40:01.708 --> 40:04.041
[Dan] Well,
what do we have here?

40:13.750 --> 40:15.792
She says it's a fake,

40:15.792 --> 40:17.750
and she is sticking
with her alibi.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.625
-You ready?
-Yeah.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.708
[instrumental music playing]

40:43.417 --> 40:44.792
[murmuring]

40:53.917 --> 40:54.917
Thank you.

41:02.083 --> 41:03.834
Here. Thanks.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.375
Do you think this is such
a good idea?

41:24.375 --> 41:26.250
It's like a puzzle and...

41:27.041 --> 41:30.667
These photos
are the pieces, but...

41:30.667 --> 41:33.708
Somehow some of
these pieces got mixed up
and I just...

41:34.917 --> 41:37.375
I keep thinking
if I could just

41:37.375 --> 41:39.333
look at these pictures
long enough,

41:40.166 --> 41:42.250
it'll start to make sense.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.500
[Rebecca]
For richer or poorer,

41:49.500 --> 41:51.208
in sickness and in health,

41:52.208 --> 41:53.333
till death do us part.

41:54.917 --> 41:56.875
Therefore, by the power
vested in me

41:56.875 --> 41:58.667
by the state of Arizona,

41:58.667 --> 42:00.792
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

42:00.792 --> 42:01.708
You may kiss the bride.

42:02.834 --> 42:04.000
Come here.

42:04.834 --> 42:06.208
[crowd cheers]

42:09.500 --> 42:10.375
[indistinct chatter]

42:11.333 --> 42:12.458
[woman]
What are they doing here?

42:13.000 --> 42:13.917
[gasps]

42:14.542 --> 42:16.500
Danny, what's going on?

42:16.500 --> 42:18.333
You're under arrest
for the murder of
Derek Rogers, sir.

42:18.333 --> 42:20.917
-Come with us, please.
-Did you know about this?

42:20.917 --> 42:22.166
We found the murder weapon
in your house.

42:22.166 --> 42:23.667
Your prints were all over it.
Let's go.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.708
-Alec!
-Rebecca! This is ridiculous!

42:25.708 --> 42:27.208
You might want to call
his attorney. Let's go!

42:27.208 --> 42:28.917
-Tell them I was set up!
-Dan!

42:32.333 --> 42:33.166
[crowd clamoring]

42:35.333 --> 42:36.750
[siren wailing]

42:39.875 --> 42:42.000
Hey. You okay?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.750
I just wasn't expecting
for it to feel like this.

42:44.625 --> 42:46.250
[Emma]
I know. I can imagine.

42:48.125 --> 42:49.834
-Any regrets?
-Not yet.

42:52.667 --> 42:54.458
But whatever's coming,
I don't want to face it alone.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.500
You won't have to.

43:25.375 --> 43:26.708
Hi, Mom.

43:27.708 --> 43:29.375
It's all working
perfectly, Sutton.

43:29.375 --> 43:30.959
Just as we planned.
