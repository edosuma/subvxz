00:07.090 --> 00:08.967
Mog was tired.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.468
She was dead tired.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.512
Her head was dead tired.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.264
Her paws were dead tired.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.850
Even her tail was dead tired.

00:16.933 --> 00:20.603
Mog thought,
"I wanna sleep forever."

00:21.855 --> 00:23.314
And so she did.

00:25.316 --> 00:26.651
Isn't this a bit young for you?

00:27.152 --> 00:28.236
Um...

00:28.319 --> 00:30.905
Sometimes he still likes it.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.741
Sometimes I still like it.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.910
Are you all right, son?

00:35.994 --> 00:38.413
Your dad was okay, you know?

00:38.496 --> 00:40.081
- Yeah.
- He was okay.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.916
Yeah.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.296
Kerry!

00:46.379 --> 00:49.758
Kerry, can you get me a book?
Uh-- Something with some action?

00:56.055 --> 00:57.265
What?

01:00.059 --> 01:01.102
Careful now.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.480
Talk to me.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.108
Gerri!

01:07.192 --> 01:09.444
- Where are you, Gerri?
Wow.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.237
That was actually
a perfect roll.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.322
Yeah, Gerri!

01:12.405 --> 01:15.450
You jump on that grenade for us.
Thanks, pal.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.538
No. It doesn't seem right.
I don't want Tennessee Avenue.

01:20.622 --> 01:21.831
My turn, then.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.793
Please be caught.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.420
And once again,
I'm on your shit.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.714
- Ooh, that'll be me.
Hmm.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.258
One-fifty.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.011
You know, I know what you tried
to do with Dad.

01:35.094 --> 01:36.346
What? Uh-- I thought that...

01:36.429 --> 01:37.847
would've kinda
been your dream, Rome,

01:37.931 --> 01:40.141
me fucking Gerri with your dick.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.310
Come on, dick pickler. Pay up.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.273
Seven, hey,
that was perfect.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.860
- Hey. Get-out-of-jail-free card.
Hmm.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.153
Another one.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.530
You wanna sell that?

01:53.613 --> 01:56.157
Oh, waitress service.
Okay.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.994
I shall have a Cuba Libre
and a club sandwich, please.

02:00.078 --> 02:03.164
Oh, okay. Well, let me,
uh, grab a couple of kid's menus

02:03.248 --> 02:04.707
and I'll be right back.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.167
Okay.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.045
The service here is weird
and slow...

02:09.128 --> 02:11.005
and fucking my dad.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.549
You still into this, Will?

02:12.632 --> 02:15.426
You wanna take a turn
around the gardens?

02:15.510 --> 02:17.804
Mm... No, I'm good.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.347
Oh, come on, Willa!
Marry him.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.266
He's probably got, like,
ten years left in him

02:21.349 --> 02:22.350
and then it's all gravy.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.102
I do not wish
my private affairs

02:24.185 --> 02:26.688
to become the subject
of table chat, okay?

02:26.771 --> 02:28.940
Okay, I have to go. Can I give
my properties to Shiv?

02:29.023 --> 02:30.400
No. No!
No! No.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.068
Why?
- You have to auction them.
The fuck are you going?

02:32.151 --> 02:35.446
Okay, uh, the silly <i>Forbes</i>
profile piece.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.407
I'm turning ATN Citizens
into a cash machine

02:37.490 --> 02:38.700
and they wanna know
how I did it.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.578
Well, by turning on
the bigot spigot to full gush.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.206
Well "bigot spigot" is a little
reductive and unfair,

02:45.290 --> 02:46.583
but anyway, goodbye.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.667
- Bye, Tom.
Bye-bye.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.586
- Um... Shiv...
Talk about me!

02:49.669 --> 02:51.004
Will do.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.338
- Shiv.
What?

02:52.422 --> 02:54.883
I think you might have, um,
accidentally been cheating.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.760
What? I was only stealing
so I could win.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.095
Yeah, cheating's
part of it.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.055
Oh, look--
Shiv, do you think

03:01.139 --> 03:03.433
that stealing
is what good people do?

03:03.516 --> 03:04.893
Stealing? Cheating at Monopoly?

03:04.976 --> 03:06.561
- Come on. Hmm.
Oh, come on.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.939
Okay, well,
he's here. Be nice.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.608
Yes, I will be nice
to Kurt Cobain

03:11.691 --> 03:13.067
of the fucking floaties.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.527
Hi.
Hey.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.237
He's just coming. Uh...

03:16.321 --> 03:18.239
He needs a minute.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.868
We, uh... We appreciate
what you did.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.578
It was nothing.

03:23.661 --> 03:24.829
Sure.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.706
But, hey, you know,

03:26.789 --> 03:28.750
if you find him
in the pool again,

03:28.833 --> 03:30.293
there's a C-note in it for you

03:30.376 --> 03:31.920
to just let him sink, okay?

03:32.712 --> 03:34.255
"Too soon," said the room.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.300
He's basically fine, they just
kept him overnight to...

03:38.176 --> 03:39.469
I don't know why, actually,

03:39.552 --> 03:41.596
'cause I don't speak Italian,
but...

03:41.679 --> 03:42.931
no media pick-up,

03:43.014 --> 03:45.767
so, all good.

03:45.850 --> 03:46.851
Good.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.519
Good. Good.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.523
Ooh.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.026
Jesus.
- Hey, buddy.

03:55.109 --> 03:56.152
- Hey.
- Kenny.

03:56.235 --> 03:57.445
- Hey!
- What's up, Ken?

03:57.528 --> 03:58.488
Hey.
- Hey.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.907
Hey.
You okay, brother?

04:00.990 --> 04:02.283
All good.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.954
Let's-- Let's just not make
a whole song and dance, okay?

04:06.037 --> 04:07.997
Well, I think we will
make a song and dance.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.916
- You nearly drowned, Ken.
Oh.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.167
No, he just fell off an air bed.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.794
- He's fine.
- One too many limoncellos.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.462
- No biggie.
Yeah?

04:16.923 --> 04:19.968
Okay. I'm just gonna
grab my kids, I guess, uh...

04:20.051 --> 04:22.345
Uh-- They can stay here,
I'm sure, tonight,

04:22.428 --> 04:23.554
if it's easier.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.015
- I'm not leaving them with him.
All right, then.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.518
I guess we'll see you
at the royal wedding then.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.936
Maybe.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.521
I might need to get home.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.064
I'm talking to new lawyers.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.899
New lawyers?
Like, new new lawyers?

04:34.983 --> 04:37.110
Yeah. Well, I can't really say,
but, yeah,

04:37.193 --> 04:39.404
just so you know, uh,

04:39.487 --> 04:42.991
we're... Yeah, we're discussing
putting everything,

04:43.074 --> 04:45.493
like all the papers
and all my communications

04:45.576 --> 04:47.662
for the last five years,
up on my Insta.

04:47.745 --> 04:48.955
On Insta?

04:49.038 --> 04:50.206
- Ken.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.166
And, uh, Comfrey,

04:52.250 --> 04:55.461
<i>Vanity Fair</i> might be doing
a big thing with me.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.964
- The whole thing, so...
Mm-hmm.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.882
Yeah, I don't know, whatever.
I'm ready to...

04:59.966 --> 05:02.301
I'm just-- I'm ready
to really get into it all.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.220
But, uh...

05:04.303 --> 05:06.389
Yeah, thanks for...

05:06.472 --> 05:08.891
Thanks. Okay, kids, let's go!

05:09.726 --> 05:10.852
Let's go!

05:11.769 --> 05:12.979
They're coming.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.356
All right, man.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.900
Later.
Yeah.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.696
He...
...seems good?

05:21.779 --> 05:23.364
Oh, man.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.116
We have been talking to--
to <i>Vanity Fair,</i>

05:25.199 --> 05:27.035
but it's-- it's mostly us
calling them.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.580
Hey, Dad!
You good? We good?

05:30.663 --> 05:32.498
Uh-- Do you want me
on that call?

05:32.582 --> 05:33.666
- No.
Okay.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.585
Go on, Karl. What?

05:35.668 --> 05:39.338
DOJ is gonna likely hit us
with an historic fine.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.841
GoJo's market cap
has overtaken ours.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.009
Okay.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.261
Okay, yeah, but that-- that was
already happening, so...

05:45.344 --> 05:48.931
GoJo's board may be considering
entertaining other options.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.224
What-- What?
- Yeah.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.352
What the fuck? Okay, well,
is he gonna pull the plug?

05:53.436 --> 05:55.313
Or is GoJo--
Rome, do you know?

05:55.396 --> 05:57.899
He swallowed the merger,
but I don't know how much more
he can fucking eat.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.068
Okay, don't get
all sweaty, Betty.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.904
I'm gonna figure it out,
and I'll drop you
an email, okay?

06:02.987 --> 06:04.947
Thanks.
I'm gonna see Matsson,

06:05.823 --> 06:06.908
get inside this.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.618
Do you want me
to come with you, Dad?

06:08.701 --> 06:10.703
No. Stay here
and play with your dick.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.247
Uh-- I can come with you, Dad.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.375
- It's not a--
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm kidding,
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.460
No, come on, Tumbledown.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.836
He's your pal.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.798
Let's go see
Hans Christian Anderfuck

06:21.881 --> 06:25.176
and see if he's been telling us
fucking fairy tales.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.727
♪ (“SUCCESSION”
THEME MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

08:56.410 --> 08:57.411
You okay?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.297
Good-looking woman, huh?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.049
Yeah.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.051
Yup.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.018
So, what is it, son?

09:21.852 --> 09:23.312
Are you scared of pussy?

09:24.730 --> 09:27.316

with you or what?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.694
Jesus, no, God, Dad,
can we not--

That's...

09:30.861 --> 09:33.781
It's-- That was just
being horrible, it's good.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.200
- It's all good.
- Yeah. Well, it's just fucking.

get straightened out,

09:40.538 --> 09:41.914

- Yeah.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.836
I don't wanna know.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.729
Welcome.

10:04.812 --> 10:05.855
Hey.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.317
So nice to
finally meet you in person, sir.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.443
Likewise.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.612
Thank you for coming.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.239
Not at all.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.158
So, what do you think?

10:17.241 --> 10:19.744
Are we doing
this fucking merger or not?

10:19.827 --> 10:22.330
Wow. Just, uh,
straight in there, huh?

10:22.413 --> 10:24.165
Oh, yeah, well,
you know, I'm old.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.499
What do you want?

10:25.583 --> 10:27.752
A bit of, "Oh, what a
nice house you got here."

10:27.835 --> 10:30.129
No, I like it.
I get bored easily.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.214
Yeah,
everything is boring, isn't it?

10:32.298 --> 10:34.216
Yeah, everything
is pretty fucking boring.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.218
Except this.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.387
- Yeah, you got me interested.
How interested?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.557
Look, I don't wanna fuck around
forever with this.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.225
I mean, I've seen
how your price is,

10:43.309 --> 10:46.395
and I understand that your board
is looking at all the options,

10:46.479 --> 10:47.897
but if we stay tight,

10:48.522 --> 10:49.815
this can work.

10:49.899 --> 10:50.941
So...

10:51.692 --> 10:53.402
shall we dance or what?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.614
- Do you wanna sit down? Yeah.
Uh-- Sure.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.032
Um...

10:58.115 --> 10:59.241
Uh, Zuckerberg once--

10:59.325 --> 11:00.826
- Do you know Mark, by the way?
- Uh-huh.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.870
Well, he once told me that, um,

11:03.788 --> 11:04.872
in ancient Rome, at one point,

11:04.955 --> 11:06.957
they wanted to make
all the slaves wear something

11:07.041 --> 11:08.376
so they could identify them.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.752
- Uh-huh.
- It's just up here.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.463
Um... Like a...
What do you call these things?

11:12.546 --> 11:14.715
Like a cloak or whatever.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.884
But then they
decided not to do it.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.011
- And do you know why?
Hmm?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.972
Because they realized if all
the slaves dressed the same,

11:22.056 --> 11:24.392
they would see
how many of them there were,

11:24.475 --> 11:27.228
and they'd rise up
and kill their masters.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.730
Yeah, we don't,
we don't love Mark.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.358
So what? Does he have
a kid in Malaysia

11:32.441 --> 11:33.984
reading history for him now?

11:34.068 --> 11:36.737
I don't know.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.532
But the point is,
if-- if we wanna survive,

11:39.615 --> 11:40.825
you and I, then...

11:40.908 --> 11:42.743
we need a hell of a lot
of little folks

11:42.827 --> 11:45.037
running around shitting us data,

11:45.121 --> 11:48.165
you know, for the eyeballs,
for the revenue, for the scale.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.795
No offense, but I don't think
you have the technology

11:52.878 --> 11:54.880
or the orientation to get there.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.675
And you don't have the content.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.385
Well, maybe not, but...

11:59.468 --> 12:01.470
we're flying
like a fucking rocket ship,

12:01.554 --> 12:04.056
and you're sinking like
a lead balloon.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.641
What's your churn like?

12:05.724 --> 12:08.185
Yeah, we hear you have problems
with binge and burn.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.895
We got the good stuff.

12:09.979 --> 12:13.566
Sure, sure, some of your content
is pretty cool, I guess, but...

12:13.649 --> 12:16.402
business-wise, it's time
for you to beef up or sell out.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.196
A-- And you can't become
a tech player

12:19.280 --> 12:22.074
because you and your business
are just too fucking old.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.870
Whoa, he is in great shape.
You know who he's fucking?

12:27.371 --> 12:29.540
I don't wanna be rude
because you're a legend.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.794
Honestly, you're...
fucking bulletproof.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.755
Tank man.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.340
So, you want me to come
in your sauna

12:38.424 --> 12:40.342
and tell you
what a pretty pecker you got?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.761
I'm just really excited
about the future.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.513
So am I.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.723
Yeah, but...

12:46.432 --> 12:48.726
are you? Really?

12:48.809 --> 12:52.229
Well, that's something
you say, isn't it?

12:54.648 --> 12:56.108
No, but I am excited.

12:57.776 --> 12:58.777
But...

13:01.197 --> 13:02.573
America...

13:03.407 --> 13:06.160
I don't know.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.829
When I arrived,
there were these gentle giants

13:08.913 --> 13:11.123
smelling of fucking gold
and milk.

13:11.790 --> 13:12.958
They could do anything.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.044
Now look at them.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.378
Fat as fuck,

13:16.462 --> 13:20.174
scrawny on meth or yoga.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.551
They pissed it all away.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.305
I don't know.

13:27.389 --> 13:28.516
I don't know.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.188
Go on. Talk to me.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.482
Well, I think we fit.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.859
Your company and mine.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.362
But, you know,

13:41.445 --> 13:43.239
the street loves us. We're...

13:43.322 --> 13:44.698
We're a strong buy.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.867
We're up
and we're staying there.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.786
And you, you have this, uh...

13:48.869 --> 13:50.913
this fine
and all this other bullshit.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.123
You're hurt...

13:53.207 --> 13:54.625
or maybe you're tired.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.087
So, I make sense
as the person to take over.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.633
Now, if-- if that's an option,
if that's something
you would consider,

14:02.716 --> 14:04.343
then let's talk.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.387
But if you wanna tell me
to go fuck myself,

14:06.470 --> 14:08.472
tell me to go fuck myself.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.933
You're not fucking serious.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.768
I would make everything
nice for you.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.270
I could pay you out,
or if you want

14:14.353 --> 14:17.064
control inside or outside
of the assets you love,

14:17.606 --> 14:18.691
that's cool.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.903
I would want you
to maintain prestige.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.613
I'm not about making you small.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.617
But you'd rule the roost.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.245
It would be your board.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.038
But I would structure it...

14:33.122 --> 14:34.373
so fucking nice for you.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.169
I notice you're not
punching me in the nose.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.715
Dad?
Ah, it's okay, son.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.343
- I don't know.
What are you thinking?

14:46.427 --> 14:48.929
I'm not telling you
what I'm fucking thinking.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.848
Well, I know
what you're fucking thinking.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.726
You're thinking every bit
of me wants to tell this...

14:53.809 --> 14:56.228
slab of gravlax

14:56.312 --> 14:58.814
to go fuck himself,

14:58.897 --> 15:02.359
except for the bit that knows
that every word he says is true.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.573
I don't know,
I'm not sure I can swallow this.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.117
If this is a family thing,
I get it.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.870
I-- I-- appreciate the anxiety.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.288
And in terms of your son,

15:14.371 --> 15:17.041
he would be essential to the
integration process.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.917
One hundred percent crucial.

15:19.835 --> 15:22.963
Key element,
the face of the family.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.591
As for the rest,
your top team,

15:25.674 --> 15:28.552
I-- I'd be happy to assess each
according to their abilities.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.055
This is not happening.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.099
Right.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.603
No.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.439
No, I see that. Understood.

15:42.608 --> 15:43.942
It was worth asking, huh?

15:45.027 --> 15:47.363
But listen, do you wanna...

15:47.446 --> 15:49.198
Do you wanna
stick around for a bit?

15:49.281 --> 15:51.450
We can see if the old deal
has a shape,

15:52.409 --> 15:54.119
side snacks, maybe.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.664
You have that Israeli
AI operation

15:56.747 --> 15:58.666
I might be interested in.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.627
An asset swap sort of thing.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.296
- Why not?
Cool.

16:07.966 --> 16:11.679
Roman. Uh...
You'd better get back.

16:11.762 --> 16:15.140
You know, your mom and all
her brouhaha for tomorrow.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.600
All right, yeah, sure thing,
sure thing.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.310
Don't wanna miss
the old nuptials.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.523
Wait, but yeah? You want...

16:22.606 --> 16:25.359
Well, yeah, my mom's getting
remarried to a bowl of porridge

16:25.442 --> 16:28.028
and it's all terribly moving,
so I should probably...

16:28.654 --> 16:30.406
But thank you.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.449
- See you over there, Pop.
Mm.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.250
Excuse me for one second.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.457
Hey! So?
Hey.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.958
So? How was the Monopoly?

17:23.041 --> 17:25.836
Did you have to pay
some income tax
for the novelty value?

17:25.919 --> 17:28.505
- Merger of equals?
- Merger of equals?

17:28.589 --> 17:30.632
Well, is it happening
or not? Rome?

17:30.716 --> 17:32.342
Um-- I was not alerted

17:32.426 --> 17:35.345
to this merger of equals
possibility.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.182
Mattson wants to de-platform
guys like me,

17:38.265 --> 17:40.768
round up the maverick thinkers
into his digital gulag.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.019
Um-- If you don't mind,

17:42.102 --> 17:43.645
I'm a little bit churned up
about my big brother,

17:43.729 --> 17:45.439
so I can't really think about
that shit right now.

17:46.064 --> 17:47.232
Talk about it later.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.903
- Hey.
Hi.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.780
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.408
- So, what is this?
- Just take a seat.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.202
Come on.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.330
Okay.

18:05.793 --> 18:06.835
So...

18:08.545 --> 18:10.506
we just wanted to get together

18:10.589 --> 18:12.883
to let you know
that we love you.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.345
What?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.889
Right?
- I love you straight up.

18:18.972 --> 18:22.434
I mean, I... suppose
I don't want you to die, so...

18:23.060 --> 18:24.353
yeah.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.021
What is this? What's the angle?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.189
No angle.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.274
We're worried that you...

18:29.358 --> 18:31.652
consciously or subconsciously
tried to...

18:31.735 --> 18:32.945
Are you trying to shut me down?

18:33.028 --> 18:35.364
Um-- You kind of tried
to kill yourself, dude,

18:35.447 --> 18:36.740
and that's not cool.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.826
- I fell off an inflatable.
Okay.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.497
Is this an intervention?

18:45.874 --> 18:48.377
Why do you get to do
an intervention on me?

18:48.460 --> 18:49.711
Seriously?

18:49.795 --> 18:51.588
Well, you need an intervention.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.882
You need an intervention,
you need an intervention.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.217
Yeah, totally, yeah, yeah,

18:55.300 --> 18:56.969
but you're kind of the top
of the pile right now.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.387
We'll do me tomorrow. Yeah?

18:58.470 --> 18:59.805
Yeah, suicides jump the line.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.474
- I fell off my fucking floatie.
You're an addict.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.601
You're addicted to booze
and to drugs

19:04.685 --> 19:07.563
and relationships and sex
and work and the family drama.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.357
No, sorry, no, I mean,
look-- look who's fucking here.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.150
I-- I-- I don't see it.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.278
You, you don't have
any standing.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.322
So, listen, you guys can take
this little committee

19:17.406 --> 19:19.241
of public fucking safety
and fuck off.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.660
You need to stop
trying to kill Pop.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.329
Okay? You're selfish,

19:24.413 --> 19:26.415
you're self- centered--
- Connor, can-- Just--

19:26.498 --> 19:27.374
What?
- Just...

19:27.457 --> 19:28.667
I'm not allowed
to say my piece?

19:28.750 --> 19:30.377
No, you can, just...
- No, it's...

19:31.420 --> 19:32.754
Let me lead, yeah?

19:36.049 --> 19:37.426
Okay. Okay, look.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.052
I hear you.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.558
But I just-- I-- I feel...

19:44.975 --> 19:46.184
like...

19:46.268 --> 19:47.895
everything I've done...

19:47.978 --> 19:49.897
has been with good intentions,

19:49.980 --> 19:53.192
and I-- I do think
this is actually about...

19:53.275 --> 19:56.445
all of you and your shit
more than me.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.572
It-- It sounds like I'm--
I'm-- I'm...

19:58.655 --> 19:59.990
being defensive, but I'm not.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.034
I'm-- I'm-- I'm saying
I'm hearing you.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.493
Mm-hmm?

20:03.577 --> 20:05.454
But it's like,
do you have any idea...

20:05.996 --> 20:07.039
how it feels...

20:08.540 --> 20:09.750
as the eldest son

20:10.584 --> 20:11.501
to be...

20:11.585 --> 20:14.046
you know, promised something
and then...

20:16.340 --> 20:17.341
you know...

20:18.717 --> 20:20.761
- just have it taken?
- Yeah.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.389
- Sure, man.
- I'm the eldest son.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.600
What was that?

20:28.560 --> 20:30.395
I am the eldest son.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.899
Well, yeah, obviously, Con,
but you know what he means.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.901
I am the eldest son!

20:35.984 --> 20:39.279
And no one told me
about this fucking merger
of fucking equals.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.447
And what if I wanna take over?

20:40.530 --> 20:43.283
- Because I am the eldest son!
All right.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.910
Eas-- Easy, Con.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.454
Let's-- Okay. Okay.
- I'm the eldest son!
I'm the eldest son!

20:47.537 --> 20:48.705
And I must be considered,

20:48.789 --> 20:50.207
and I need to be taken
into account.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.793
Con, we're--
we're talking about...

20:52.876 --> 20:55.128
- what I actually lost.
Shut up.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.463
What, you're hurt?

20:57.798 --> 21:00.676
I didn't see Pop
for three years,

21:00.759 --> 21:02.594
but your spoon wasn't
shiny enough,

21:02.970 --> 21:04.346
huh?

21:04.429 --> 21:06.640
Well, it is not all about you.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.476
- I thought you loved me.
Asshole!

21:09.559 --> 21:11.186
I do love you.
I love all three of you pricks,

21:11.269 --> 21:13.480
but what do I get
from you chumps
but chump change?

21:13.563 --> 21:16.149
Fucking chump change.
Well, fuck you.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.988
I'm here for your mom's wedding,
and I proposed to my fiancée.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.115
And no one...

21:23.907 --> 21:25.534
has said congratulations.

21:27.285 --> 21:28.286
No one.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.456
But I am...

21:31.540 --> 21:33.709
the eldest son of our father.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.252
I am.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.129
I am.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.631
Me.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.053
He is him.

21:45.929 --> 21:46.972
Fuck off!

21:53.979 --> 21:55.355
No, no, it's the other one.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.940
It's coming,
it's coming for you.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.361
- You okay, Con?
Yeah, yeah.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.239
Just a little tired.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.159
Sorry about the tossing
and turning,

22:07.242 --> 22:09.369
I just couldn't get
the AC right, you know?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.497
The AC. Yeah. Sure.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.833
Plus, my family hates me.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.754
I'm gonna lose ATN
to a goddamn Swede,

22:18.837 --> 22:21.590
so my campaign is fucked,
and you're gonna leave me.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.383
And I love you.

22:24.092 --> 22:25.093
So, yeah.

22:26.386 --> 22:27.721
Yeah, that and the AC.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.725
Come on!

22:33.351 --> 22:35.145
- Con?
- What?

22:36.646 --> 22:37.814
You're a nice man.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.108
Right. Thanks.

22:44.696 --> 22:45.739
You know what?

22:47.282 --> 22:48.325
Fuck it.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.494
- Fuck it?
Fuck it.

22:53.997 --> 22:55.373
As-- As in?

22:55.457 --> 22:56.500
Fuck it!

22:56.583 --> 22:59.002
Come on. How bad can it be?
Right?

23:00.629 --> 23:02.172
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

23:02.255 --> 23:03.673
You know, we'll have fun.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.675
Fuck it, right?

23:06.259 --> 23:08.386
Right?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.180
- Hell yeah.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.599
Fuck it!

23:12.682 --> 23:14.142
Mr. Roy?

23:14.226 --> 23:15.602
That's your car.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.607
Fuck it, huh?
Fuck it!

23:20.690 --> 23:22.442
Fuck it forever!

23:49.761 --> 23:51.096
- Hi.
Hi, Karl.
How you doing?

23:51.179 --> 23:52.389
How's the Wi-Fi?

23:52.472 --> 23:54.975
Uh-- I sacrificed a few goats,
so it seems to be working.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.561
Great. Rural Tuscany,
real business hub.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.646
How are his spirits?

23:59.729 --> 24:01.982
Like his, uh...
How's his blood sugar?

24:02.065 --> 24:03.608
Yeah. He's amazing, as always.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.403
Oh, yeah, of course.
Powerhouse. Remarkable.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.167
Have you seen Dad?

24:20.250 --> 24:22.043
Hmm?
Is he coming?

24:22.127 --> 24:24.671
Is Dad coming, Rome?
Do you know?

24:24.754 --> 24:28.300
- Is the deal good?
- Yeah. All will be revealed.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.885
- All will be revealed.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.553
The fuck does that mean?

24:31.636 --> 24:33.305
Who made you the Wizard of Fuck?

24:34.264 --> 24:35.223
Um...

24:35.307 --> 24:36.600
You don't know
jack shit, do you?

24:36.683 --> 24:39.019
Do you not think
one last check with Mom?

24:39.936 --> 24:41.188
Rome, we're about to go in.

24:41.271 --> 24:44.733
Right. It's just... I don't know
if he's, you know, a hernia.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.568
Hey, Peter.
Hi.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.570
Yeah.
Good luck.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.488
You're not sure
if he's the one?

24:50.572 --> 24:52.157
I'm worried about the prenup,
okay?

24:52.240 --> 24:53.450
She has a prenup.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.910
- She had her-- Yes!
- She does?

24:54.993 --> 24:56.995
She had her lawyer look at it
because she wants to keep the--

24:57.078 --> 24:59.289
the London flat that
Dad gave her.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.624
Well,
what if he poisons her?

25:00.707 --> 25:02.167
What if he pushes her
down the stairs

25:02.250 --> 25:03.752
to get this flat he so desires?

25:03.835 --> 25:05.587
Oh, yeah. And what if, worse,

25:05.670 --> 25:07.756
he fucks her with his dick?

25:07.839 --> 25:10.258
Fucks her so good that she dies?

25:10.342 --> 25:11.343
How you doing, children?

25:11.426 --> 25:12.677
Oh-- Oh, Tom.
Hey, Greg.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.471
Do you mind chatting
with Comfrey?

25:14.554 --> 25:17.140
I wanna check in
on the princess.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.768
"The princess" now?
I thought she was a contessa.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.478
Yeah, but I guess
through her dad,

25:21.561 --> 25:25.065
she's, like, eighth in line
for the throne of Luxembourg?

25:25.148 --> 25:26.233
Eighth in line?

25:26.316 --> 25:29.069
Greg, you marry her,
you're a plane crash away

25:29.152 --> 25:31.279
from becoming
Europe's weirdest king!

25:31.363 --> 25:32.239
Don't be silly.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.491
Dude, you off
a couple of hemophiliacs

25:34.574 --> 25:36.076
and you'll be
the king of Luxembourg.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.494
You'd sound like a fancy cookie.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.412
It's actually a Grand Duchy.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.667
It's something to do
with the Congress of Vienna.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.210
It's, I guess,
really complicated.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.544
She doesn't like
to talk about it,

25:46.628 --> 25:48.588
although we do talk about it
quite a bit.

25:49.422 --> 25:50.715
Um...

25:50.799 --> 25:51.925
Oh, see. Now?

25:52.008 --> 25:53.593
- Roman!
- Get in there, Greg.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.054
If Roman marries her,
he'll invade France.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.564
Hold on.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.989
Yeah, yeah.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.075
- I'll send your regrets.
- Hmm.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.624
Kerry, I won't eat down there,

26:24.708 --> 26:27.627
I will take my omelet
in my room, on my return.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.754
- Of course. I'll let them know.
- Thank you.

26:35.343 --> 26:36.678
Sorry. Sorry.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.305
I didn't delay things, did I?

26:38.388 --> 26:39.973
No worries, Kendall.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.725
- We're just missing a couple
of people, actually.
- Good of you to come.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.351
You don't know where,
um--
Sorry.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.312
- You don't know where, uh...
- Peter, I think you'd better
face it

26:45.395 --> 26:47.147
that Logan is not gonna make it.

26:47.230 --> 26:49.441
You might have to just make do
with me. Sorry.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.026
- How about that?

26:51.109 --> 26:51.985
Darling.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.403
- Can you bear it?
- Of course.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.459
- Hey.
- Hmm?

27:07.542 --> 27:08.585
- Rome.
- Yeah?

27:08.668 --> 27:10.128
- I have an idea.
- Mm-hmm?

27:10.211 --> 27:13.757
When they come past, you should
tell Mom that you love her.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.216
Yeah, fuck off.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.093
No, how romantic would it be?

27:17.177 --> 27:18.887
Imagine that, if you could
marry Mommy

27:18.970 --> 27:21.222
- on her wedding day?
Yeah, yeah.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.433
Or tell them a reason
that they can't be married.

27:23.516 --> 27:24.559
Because she's the only one

27:24.642 --> 27:26.102
who makes her son's
pee-pee go boom boom.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.312
Mm-hmm?

27:34.110 --> 27:37.280
Welcome family,
friends, and loved ones.

27:37.364 --> 27:41.117
We are gathered here today
in the face of this company

27:41.201 --> 27:44.245
for the wedding
of Peter Timothy Munga Munion

27:44.329 --> 27:48.208
and Caroline Alexandra Helena
St. John Collingwood.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.752
- Oh, she's really feeling it,
huh?

27:50.835 --> 27:52.545
- I love weddings.
- Me, too.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.714
...the formal
commitment they make
to one another...

27:56.007 --> 27:58.343
- Jesus, what is she on?
- Yeah.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.512
- Fucking kill me now.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.059
Okay. Uh-- Hi.

28:06.142 --> 28:08.353
Uh-- My mom has...

28:08.436 --> 28:10.105
...has asked me
to say a few words.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.231
Just a second.

28:11.314 --> 28:15.402
And the first words
that came to mind were, uh,

28:15.485 --> 28:17.862
"Shit." "No." "What?" "Bitch."

28:19.322 --> 28:20.990
And, uh...

28:21.074 --> 28:23.868
other words
like "totally" and "unprepared."

28:23.952 --> 28:25.078
Right.

28:25.161 --> 28:26.704
So, what can I say about my mom?

28:26.788 --> 28:28.123
Well...

28:28.206 --> 28:30.125
she's been a constant
in my life.

28:31.167 --> 28:33.336
Constant pain in the...

28:33.420 --> 28:34.295
Eh...

28:34.379 --> 28:36.506
- But I love her anyway...

28:36.589 --> 28:38.466
...which I guess
is testament to...

28:38.550 --> 28:41.302
what a remarkable and...

28:41.386 --> 28:45.140
...complicated and interesting
person that she is.

28:45.223 --> 28:48.852
And I have no doubt, Peter,
that you will never be bored

28:48.935 --> 28:50.478
in the brief time
that you're married.

28:51.729 --> 28:54.732
But in all seriousness,
there's no one like my mom.

28:56.776 --> 28:58.027
And you're a lucky guy.

28:58.111 --> 29:01.197
And I am jealous of the time
that you get to spend with her.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.159
I hope that your marriage

29:04.242 --> 29:09.205
is as rich and happy, rewarding,
and fulfilling as mine.

29:09.289 --> 29:13.710
So, here's to, uh, the bride
and groom.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.628
- The bride and groom!
The bride and groom!

29:15.712 --> 29:20.008
-♪ ♪

29:26.264 --> 29:27.515
Do you think, uh...

29:28.475 --> 29:29.809
Do you think
she knows something?

29:31.769 --> 29:33.146
Mm.
I mean...

29:33.229 --> 29:34.814
what if it's all fallen apart?

29:34.898 --> 29:36.316
Yeah? Dad's back,

29:36.399 --> 29:38.485
- so why isn't he here?
Oh, relax.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.236
It's, uh-- It's cool beans.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.071
Cool beans?

29:42.155 --> 29:43.990
Since when do you say
"cool beans"?

29:44.073 --> 29:45.533
You don't have
a fucking clue, do you?

29:45.617 --> 29:47.076
Hmm. Hmm.
- Hey, hey, hey.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.286
- Hey.
Hi.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.288
Hey, uh, listen,
I think we should, uh,

29:50.371 --> 29:51.998
- say sorry for--
No, doesn't matter.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.333
Doesn't matter.

29:53.416 --> 29:55.877
- Forget about it.
Mm-hmm. Forgotten.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.128
Okay.
Yeah.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.671
So, guess who's gonna
get married

29:58.755 --> 30:00.882
to the greatest gal
in the world.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.800
No.
- Oh. She said yes?

30:02.884 --> 30:04.385
Wow, you finally
ground her down, huh?

30:04.469 --> 30:05.553
Congrats, man.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.890
Yeah. And, um, also,
Willa's been talking to Kerry.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.225
Yeah. She know where Dad is?

30:10.308 --> 30:14.145
Uh-uh, she's sandbagging,
but do you know what this is?

30:14.229 --> 30:16.356
That is another dried penis

30:16.439 --> 30:18.358
from one of the great men
of history, correct?

30:18.441 --> 30:19.984
No. Maca root.

30:21.027 --> 30:22.445
For Dad's smoothie.

30:22.529 --> 30:23.863
Mm-hmm?

30:23.947 --> 30:25.490
Why is Kerry sandbagging?

30:25.573 --> 30:28.368
He's working on his baby batter.

30:28.451 --> 30:31.287
- What's that?
- Maca root. Almond butter.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.289
Dad's putting together

30:33.373 --> 30:36.042
a more adhesive
and potent gloop.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.126
Working on his fucking--

30:37.210 --> 30:38.378
- his jism? Are you--
Yes!

30:38.461 --> 30:39.879
- Are you fucking
with me right now?
No!

30:39.963 --> 30:41.631
What?
- Look at all the walnuts
he's been munching.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.591
He's gonna be rocking sperms
like a little catfish.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.260
- Oh, my fuck.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.262
- Dad's scrambling the fighters.
Yeah.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.097
- With Maca root.
- No. Fucking-- Come on.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.848
Not good. No, you don't
tangle with the root

30:50.932 --> 30:52.642
unless you're firing up
the siege engines.

30:52.725 --> 30:53.768
Uh.
- Jesus.

30:53.851 --> 30:55.103
- I feel ill.
Do you?

30:55.186 --> 30:57.146
I guess he really doesn't rate
you guys, huh?

30:58.022 --> 30:59.065
- Thanks.
Anyway,

30:59.148 --> 31:01.484
- thought I'd tell ya.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.820
Okay. Well, we need a plan
to kill this baby.

31:03.903 --> 31:04.904
Uh... Yeah.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.490
Wow. Finally, you found
a worthy adversary.

31:08.366 --> 31:09.659
Hey. What's going on?

31:09.742 --> 31:11.244
Uh... Nothing.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.788
Just Dad cranking up
the trebuchet.

31:13.871 --> 31:15.957
What?
- Trying for a baby.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.292
- What?
- Mm.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.918
Maybe that's what
he's doing right now.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.086
Yeah. Maybe.

31:20.169 --> 31:21.588
He's in the spawn chamber,

31:21.671 --> 31:23.631
issuing his hell seed.
Sure. I could see it.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.467
Well, maybe we should
get cracking? Space race?

31:26.551 --> 31:27.677
What? You two?

31:27.760 --> 31:29.971
- Should we say?
- No, no, no, no, no.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.264
- I know for a fact...
Babe, stop.

31:31.347 --> 31:33.057
...that she cannot get pregnant.
Because if she could,

31:33.141 --> 31:34.517
she would have--
That would've happened by now.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.145
She has had a lot of sex
with a lot of men.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.855
We may be freezing.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.565
- Oh, you may be freezing?
- Yeah.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.025
Oh, okay. Yeah.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.443
You know why
she's making you wait, right?

31:43.526 --> 31:44.694
She's gonna make you carry it.

31:44.777 --> 31:45.945
Uh-huh. Very funny.
- Yeah.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.614
You're gonna have to poop out
your own baby

31:47.697 --> 31:49.532
and then squeeze
your little Tommy tits

31:49.616 --> 31:50.700
for man milk.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.243
Hey.
Okay. Thank you very--

31:52.327 --> 31:54.829
I just heard
that Larry Vansitart's PJ

31:54.912 --> 31:55.997
landed at La Dante

31:56.080 --> 31:58.249
and that he's headed
to Lake Maggiore.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.250
What?
- Yeah.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.418
Larry Vansitart?

32:00.501 --> 32:02.170
With Matsson?
That means financing.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.504
Why would Matsson--

32:03.588 --> 32:06.257
Yeah. Why would Matsson need
financing for an all-stock deal?

32:06.341 --> 32:07.675
I'm trying to get a fix.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.637
And Greg has been contacted
by some assistants.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.763
- Greg has?
Greg.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.515
Yeah. So let's split up
and pool, okay?

32:14.599 --> 32:16.017
- Okay. All right.
- Rome?

32:16.100 --> 32:17.560
Yeah?
- You're supposed to be
inside track on this.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.479
This could be any
number of things.
I think it's fine.

32:19.562 --> 32:22.815
I'm gonna hit Kerry. Could you,
um, talk to Marcia, maybe?

32:22.899 --> 32:24.776
Yeah. Sure. I'll scale the...

32:24.859 --> 32:26.611
north face of the fucking Eiger.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.364
Jesus fuck.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.157
I mean, I guess
I tried to feel better

32:31.240 --> 32:33.576
by giving a lot of money to...

32:33.660 --> 32:36.245
- environmental charities.
- Oh, yeah?

32:36.329 --> 32:37.955
Which-- Or, like, to--

32:38.039 --> 32:39.332
to-- Not Greenpeace?

32:39.415 --> 32:41.250
No. Friends of the Earth.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.044
Okay. Oh, yeah,
that's a good one.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.213
- Mm-hmm.
- No, I, uh--

32:45.296 --> 32:47.423
I have some beef
with Greenpeace.

32:47.507 --> 32:50.510
Uh-- Long story,
but they're bad.

32:50.593 --> 32:53.054
Yeah. One guy in Greenland
just cashing checks

32:53.137 --> 32:54.097
and eating penguins

32:54.180 --> 32:56.516
and stomping cigarettes out
on glaciers.

32:56.599 --> 32:58.059
Feel free to cut him down dead,
by the way.

32:58.142 --> 33:01.396
We are actually having
an interesting talk.

33:01.479 --> 33:02.814
Yeah, I'm sure you are.
Um...

33:02.897 --> 33:05.858
He's what's called in our land
an irrelevant pauper,

33:05.942 --> 33:07.068
and you don't need to listen

33:07.151 --> 33:08.319
- to the pauper.
Oh.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.821
It's not for your royal ears.

33:09.904 --> 33:12.573
- No. No. No. <i>De no.</i>
No-de-no?

33:12.657 --> 33:13.866
No-de-no, my friend.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.202
- He's widely known, uh...
- I'm widely known?

33:16.285 --> 33:19.288
I think you'd agree, Roman,
that you're s-- a self-admitted,

33:19.372 --> 33:20.915
uh...

33:20.998 --> 33:23.501
Sorry, I don't know how
you'd say this in your language,

33:23.584 --> 33:26.212
but, uh-- but a, uh... uh...

33:26.295 --> 33:27.880
a sexual pervert.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.006
You're an...
Right?

33:29.090 --> 33:31.134
-...interesting family.
Mm-hmm.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.261
Funny guy.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.804
All jokes aside,

33:34.887 --> 33:37.223
uh, I heard that you may have
been getting some tremors

33:37.306 --> 33:38.933
on the assistant loop.
This true?

33:39.350 --> 33:41.102
Yeah. Uh...

33:41.185 --> 33:42.937
A call went out on LackeySlack

33:43.020 --> 33:44.480
because there are a number
of advisors

33:44.564 --> 33:47.066
in town from LionTree,
apparently.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.235
And they don't like
the feel of the...

33:49.318 --> 33:51.404
hard Italian pillows?

33:51.487 --> 33:53.114
So-- But that's a--
It's a private chat, so--

33:53.197 --> 33:54.866
Yeah, shut up, all right.
Thank you.

34:20.892 --> 34:21.976
- Hey. Excuse me. Uh...
Hey.

34:22.059 --> 34:23.644
What did you say
to Gerri just now?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.605
Um... Nothing.

34:26.689 --> 34:28.191
Nothing?

34:28.274 --> 34:29.942
And, uh, why are you lying?

34:30.026 --> 34:31.360
Did he tell you to lie?

34:31.444 --> 34:33.321
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

34:34.405 --> 34:35.531
Are you trying to have
a baby with my Dad?

34:35.615 --> 34:37.617
Because that's
an incredibly stupid idea.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.452
- Hey.
- It'll be born old,

34:39.535 --> 34:40.787
attached to a walker.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.498
So, uh, there's a bunch of new
M&A advisors in Chianciano.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.416
And I think Karl and Frank
are in Europe.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.919
Uh-- What the fuck, Rome?
What is--

34:48.002 --> 34:48.961
Are we being fucked?

34:49.045 --> 34:50.338
Mm-hmm.
- Karl?

34:50.755 --> 34:51.756
Euro ring.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.967
Hey, Karl, how you doing?
Where are you, man?

34:56.719 --> 34:59.347
At the office? In your office?

34:59.430 --> 35:01.641
Great, well, I'll leave you
to get on with your office job,

35:01.724 --> 35:03.726
then, you motherfucker.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.520
- Marcia? Anything?
Uh-- No.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.355
She's throwing out bullshit.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.564
Did you see Gerri?

35:08.648 --> 35:10.733
- What the fuck. Before?
Uh-huh. Yeah.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.735
- This is ugly, Rome.
- Mm-hmm.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.155
- Um-- So...
What?

35:16.239 --> 35:20.743
I should probably say,
in terms of the meeting, um,

35:20.827 --> 35:24.038
Matsson did float,
ju-- as an idea,

35:24.872 --> 35:26.374
that maybe they'd buy us.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.045
Mm-hmm.

35:31.128 --> 35:32.588
Uh...

35:33.714 --> 35:35.091
And what did Dad say?

35:35.174 --> 35:36.509
Fuck off!

35:38.052 --> 35:40.680
Mm-hmm? But he stuck around?

35:42.473 --> 35:43.808
He stuck around, yeah.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.977
Jesus Christ.

35:46.060 --> 35:48.521
- Why the fuck
didn't you tell me this earlier?
- Yeah.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.652
Hey. Hey, Ken.

35:54.735 --> 35:57.822
Uh-- We might need to talk.
Company stuff.

35:59.448 --> 36:02.201
I don't-- I'm not interested,
Shiv.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.370
Okay. Yeah, sure.

36:04.453 --> 36:06.747
But this is fucking important,
okay?

36:06.831 --> 36:08.207
Five minutes, please.

36:08.291 --> 36:11.794
Just-- We need your line
to Frank or Stewy maybe.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.756
Kendall, I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't important.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.432
Come on.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.726
Hurry the fuck up!

36:47.496 --> 36:50.207
Okay. Well, Dad
is doing us dirty, right?

36:50.291 --> 36:52.043
Can you not make it a thing
right away, okay?

36:52.126 --> 36:53.961
We actually don't--
We don't know yet.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.381
Matsson pitched to Dad the idea

36:57.965 --> 36:59.592
of them eating us,

36:59.675 --> 37:01.093
but I think
he was flying a kite.

37:01.177 --> 37:03.095
Dad kind of shut it down.

37:03.179 --> 37:04.555
Okay, he "kind of" shut it down?

37:04.639 --> 37:06.390
Because a moment ago,
he told him to fuck off!

37:06.474 --> 37:08.267
Okay. Well, I didn't keep track
of the exact number

37:08.351 --> 37:10.353
of expletives he used,
Siobhan, okay?

37:10.436 --> 37:11.812
I'm not a fuckometer.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.273
Okay, well, look,
Larry Vansitart
is in Switzerland with Matsson,

37:14.357 --> 37:15.691
so he's looking for financing.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.777
Dad is huddled
with Karl and Frank.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.403
Mm-hmm?
- Our market caps have tipped.

37:19.487 --> 37:22.198
The local town's been bought out
by a new set of advisors.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.866
Something has flipped!

37:23.950 --> 37:25.451
Yeah. Yeah. But...

37:25.534 --> 37:27.870
Dad would never sell, would he?

37:27.954 --> 37:30.122
Hey, asshole,
Dad would never sell, right?

37:30.206 --> 37:32.375
- I don't know.
I mean, would he?

37:33.751 --> 37:36.963
And if he did, would we get--
I don't know, uh...

37:37.755 --> 37:39.298
Would we get fucking protection?

37:42.718 --> 37:44.512
Can you guys just do this
without me?

37:44.595 --> 37:46.722
Yeah? I ca-- I--
I don't wanna get into it.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.768
Wait a minute, Ken.
I'm sorry. Ken?

37:50.851 --> 37:53.521
Do you have an angle on this?
Are you speaking with Matsson?

38:01.195 --> 38:03.823
Uh-- Laird has called me,
so what's that?

38:03.906 --> 38:05.491
Oh.
Shit.

38:10.329 --> 38:12.832
Ken? Can we talk?

38:15.668 --> 38:17.086
Shiv, I'm not here.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.138
Hey, buddy.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.725
Hey. You okay?

38:39.900 --> 38:42.945
There's something really wrong
with me, Shiv.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.864
I don't know what the fuck
is wrong with me.

38:44.947 --> 38:45.948
Uh...

38:47.324 --> 38:50.161
Well, it's okay. It's...

38:51.078 --> 38:52.038
I'm-- I'm just, uh--

38:52.121 --> 38:53.748
I'm not feeling
very connected...

38:55.624 --> 38:56.751
to my children...

38:57.668 --> 39:00.087
or my endeavors right now.

39:00.171 --> 39:04.258
And, uh, I can't get one thing
right with another, you know?

39:07.678 --> 39:08.679
Uh...

39:08.763 --> 39:10.014
Uh, I'm-- I'm...

39:11.891 --> 39:14.435
I don't know what happened.
I tried to do something.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.979
I tr-- I-- I really-- I tried...

39:17.980 --> 39:20.399
I tried.

39:20.483 --> 39:22.568
I know, man.

39:22.651 --> 39:26.238
- I know, you fucked it.

39:26.322 --> 39:27.865
Fuck you.

39:27.948 --> 39:29.867
That's what happened, yeah.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.744
I took a shot.

39:31.827 --> 39:34.413
But it's like...

39:35.915 --> 39:39.376
- it didn't matter. But...
- It's just business, okay?

39:39.460 --> 39:40.836
Like...

39:40.920 --> 39:43.464
we're all fucked.
Everything just sort of got...

39:44.173 --> 39:45.633
mixed up.

39:45.716 --> 39:48.427
I thought I had an out.
I could see it, I could...

39:49.345 --> 39:51.555
I could see
the way markers

39:51.639 --> 39:52.890
and I thought I could--

39:52.973 --> 39:55.476
Out of all our shit,
I thought I...

39:55.559 --> 39:58.187
I thought I could
take us all out if it. I...

39:59.939 --> 40:01.774
I did-- I did try.

40:01.857 --> 40:02.900
Mm-hmm.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.195
But... I don't know.

40:07.863 --> 40:09.198
I'm not a good person.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.450
Well, whatever, you're fine.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.287
I'm-- I'm bad.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.125
Come on.

40:20.334 --> 40:21.627
Lighten up, glum-glum.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.423
I killed a kid.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.510
Hmm?

40:29.593 --> 40:32.221
- What?
- I killed a kid.

40:32.304 --> 40:33.889
And...

40:33.973 --> 40:35.891
yeah, they're--
they're coming for me.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.351
They're gonna come for me.

40:37.434 --> 40:39.687
Is this...
Uh-- Is this real?

40:39.770 --> 40:40.771
What the fuck?

40:40.855 --> 40:43.023
- At your wedding.
What?

40:43.566 --> 40:44.733
Horse shit.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.279
The kid.

40:51.407 --> 40:52.658
That kid.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.451
Uh-- You mean the...

40:54.535 --> 40:56.328
waiter kid? The...

40:56.412 --> 40:59.290
I was high,
and I was looking for...

41:00.040 --> 41:03.878
to score and I was drunk,

41:03.961 --> 41:06.505
I was fucked up, and I drove.

41:08.382 --> 41:11.552
And he saw something
and he snatched at the wheel,

41:11.635 --> 41:13.679
and we went into the water.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.975
And then
I left him in there and ran.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.228
- Okay. Uh...

41:21.312 --> 41:23.647
Let's-- We gotta get you--
Come on.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.441
It's fucking lonely.

41:25.774 --> 41:26.775
Hey.

41:27.735 --> 41:30.070
I'm all apart.

41:34.783 --> 41:37.578
I mean, if it pleases
the court...

41:38.746 --> 41:40.706
...it sounds
like you didn't kill him.

41:40.789 --> 41:44.418
It sounds to me like
he killed him.

41:44.501 --> 41:46.462
Rome, I'm a piece of shit, man.

41:46.545 --> 41:48.005
But...

41:48.088 --> 41:50.090
the road and the water
killed him?

41:50.174 --> 41:51.509
That's what it sounds like.

41:51.592 --> 41:53.594
Nah, man. Don't.

41:53.677 --> 41:55.554
No, seriously. I mean,

41:55.638 --> 41:58.432
you crashed, and then what?
You did-- You ran?

41:58.515 --> 42:01.727
No. No.
I mean...

42:03.479 --> 42:04.813
I tried to get him.

42:06.148 --> 42:08.359
You did? Okay. See?

42:09.109 --> 42:10.110
That's...

42:10.694 --> 42:14.323
I-- I dived a few times.

42:14.406 --> 42:16.200
This sounds like the story
of a hero to me.

42:16.283 --> 42:17.993
I would've been
straight out of there.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.703
Serious, I would've been out
of that water like a...

42:19.787 --> 42:21.914
-...tabby cat out of a bath.

42:21.997 --> 42:23.165
Don't, man.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.628
Don't.

42:29.296 --> 42:31.507
Don't, man,
I'm a-- I'm a killer.

42:31.590 --> 42:32.800
Fuck you.

42:32.883 --> 42:35.803
Bullshit. Come on.
At worst, you're...

42:35.886 --> 42:39.098
you're an irresponsibler, okay?

42:39.181 --> 42:40.641
You're bigging yourself up.

42:41.767 --> 42:42.768
Yeah?

42:43.602 --> 42:45.020
I don't know, you guys.

42:45.813 --> 42:46.981
I don't know.

42:48.357 --> 42:50.776
I'm blown into a million pieces.

42:50.859 --> 42:52.903
Okay, we gotta
get you out of here.

42:54.655 --> 42:56.448
What-- Where do we go?

42:56.532 --> 42:57.616
Bring him back to the chapel,

42:57.700 --> 42:59.201
stuff him in a confessional?
That'll fix it.

43:02.204 --> 43:03.789
Ah...

43:03.872 --> 43:05.082
Oh, shit.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.627
Oh. Laird's called me back.

43:08.711 --> 43:11.171
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-- Yeah. Just one minute.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.339
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

43:12.423 --> 43:14.508
Yeah. Okay. Take that call.

43:14.591 --> 43:17.094
Leave me here
with all the feelings.
Thank you.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.971
Hey, Laird.
Go on. What's up?

43:27.104 --> 43:28.647
I mean, who hasn't clipped
the odd kid

43:28.731 --> 43:30.649
- with a Porsche, am I right?

43:30.733 --> 43:32.818
I mean, it's like a rite
of passage.

43:32.901 --> 43:34.778
I've killed a kid too, big deal.

43:35.529 --> 43:36.864
Shiv!

43:36.947 --> 43:39.658
- You've killed a kid, right?
- Uh-- Yeah.

43:39.742 --> 43:41.994
Man, you fucked my wedding
in so many ways.

43:44.580 --> 43:45.831
I'm sorry.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.500
I'm sorry.

43:48.584 --> 43:51.170
You know, one waiter down,
that makes sense. It...

43:52.629 --> 43:55.466
...took me forever to get
a fucking drink at her wedding.

43:56.467 --> 43:57.760
- Please, man.
- Okay, yeah.

43:57.843 --> 43:59.136
I ca-- I can't...

44:00.137 --> 44:02.431
You're right. I'm a--

44:02.514 --> 44:04.475
I guess I'm just trying
to say, like,

44:05.643 --> 44:06.810
who's the real victim here?

44:06.894 --> 44:09.271
I waited three quarters
of an hour for a gin and tonic.

44:14.151 --> 44:15.152
Okay.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.493
Uh... Okay.

44:22.576 --> 44:24.536
- Sorry to...

44:24.620 --> 44:26.955
...say this, Ken, but confirmed.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.709
Laird is inside the deal,

44:30.793 --> 44:33.712
but he's been cucked out
of the lead, so he's bitter
and bleating.

44:33.796 --> 44:35.589
GoJo buys Waystar.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.842
They pay a premium,
Dad cashes out,

44:38.926 --> 44:42.721
cash and stock,
and he keeps maybe a title,

44:42.805 --> 44:43.972
uh, but...

44:44.056 --> 44:45.265
and takes a few assets,

44:45.349 --> 44:47.476
but it's Matsson's
fucking board.

44:47.559 --> 44:49.645
Can we trust that?
Is that real?

44:49.728 --> 44:51.105
Kendall, I know
this isn't ideal,

44:51.188 --> 44:52.523
but we have to talk
about this now.

44:52.606 --> 44:55.192
Look, I'll call the car.
Let's just get the fuck
out of here.

45:20.467 --> 45:21.635
Where do you wanna wait?

45:21.718 --> 45:23.470
Uh-- Can I--
Can I be with you guys?

45:23.554 --> 45:25.556
Yeah. Of course.
Okay.

45:47.327 --> 45:48.579
Okay, so...

45:49.830 --> 45:51.165
we gotta go stop this.

45:56.753 --> 45:58.505
- Mm-hmm.
What the fuck?

45:58.589 --> 46:00.007
Yeah.

46:00.090 --> 46:02.843
So, we go see him,
and we tell him
we just won't have it, right?

46:16.440 --> 46:17.566
Um...

46:18.734 --> 46:19.902
Rome.

46:21.403 --> 46:22.488
Okay.

46:38.962 --> 46:40.380
This is rumors,

46:40.464 --> 46:43.842
so I will need to talk to him
directly, just me.

46:43.926 --> 46:45.344
Do you think
you're close to him?

46:45.427 --> 46:46.929
You're just
his little rat fucker.

46:47.012 --> 46:49.223
I'm just saying,
as a matter of fact,

46:49.306 --> 46:51.391
that Dad and I have been
working closely lately

46:51.475 --> 46:53.227
and I don't wanna
go in too aggressive.

46:53.310 --> 46:57.523
I'm not busting in there
crying "Team Shiv," okay?

46:57.606 --> 46:59.733
We don't know how this
is gonna play out just yet.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.944
You think dad is protecting you?
Hmm?

47:02.027 --> 47:05.531
No. We let Matsson take control,
that is Dad slamming the door.

47:05.614 --> 47:07.449
It means that he doesn't ever
think that we will,

47:07.533 --> 47:09.034
can, or should take over.

47:09.117 --> 47:10.744
I just don't think
we should be aggressive.

47:10.827 --> 47:13.205
I mean, can we even
actually stop him?

47:14.122 --> 47:15.123
Yes.

47:15.707 --> 47:16.875
A change of control

47:16.959 --> 47:18.794
needs a super majority
in the holding company.

47:18.877 --> 47:22.548
Mom got us that in the divorce.
He'd need us on board.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.217
Right. Well...

47:25.300 --> 47:28.345
I'm not sure I wanna
pull out a move like that.

47:28.428 --> 47:30.013
Maybe I just stick
with what I got.

47:30.097 --> 47:31.098
Which is what?

47:31.181 --> 47:33.100
- Hard drive full of dick pics?
Nice.

47:33.183 --> 47:34.434
Which is...

47:34.518 --> 47:36.228
I think with dad
pulling the strings...

47:36.311 --> 47:39.439
Where do you think we fit
on Matsson's new org chart,
Rome?

47:39.523 --> 47:42.442
He'll Romanov you and take you
to the cellar and that's that.

47:44.403 --> 47:46.655
Rome, you know dad is never
gonna choose you

47:46.738 --> 47:48.782
because he thinks there's
something wrong with you.

47:50.492 --> 47:51.660
I'm sorry, but...

47:51.743 --> 47:53.120
maybe it's time that we said
these things to each other

47:53.203 --> 47:56.206
instead of just talking it
all out to <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

47:59.376 --> 48:00.919
And the holding company move.

48:02.170 --> 48:03.547
If we do that, that's real?

48:03.630 --> 48:05.090
He can't sanction a deal
without us,

48:05.173 --> 48:07.217
that's legal fact.

48:07.301 --> 48:08.802
Block him and he's fucked.

48:08.885 --> 48:10.137
Okay, so...

48:10.220 --> 48:12.973
...time to rip off the Band-Aid.

48:14.391 --> 48:16.476
We just-- We push him out.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.812
We get him on his own,
and we say "urinary tract,"

48:18.895 --> 48:20.022
we say "shareholder meeting."

48:20.105 --> 48:22.274
Right, he nearly fucking
croaked at Josh's.

48:22.357 --> 48:24.276
Yeah, he's out of it.
He's fucking a 20-year-old

48:24.359 --> 48:25.861
and he's planning
for babies in jars.

48:25.944 --> 48:28.447
You know, he's gone loopy,
and he-- he's tried
to sell the shop.

48:28.530 --> 48:30.741
So, I mean, even just
fucking his assistant.

48:30.824 --> 48:32.451
We tell the board that,
he's toast.

48:32.534 --> 48:33.660
We push him out.

48:34.328 --> 48:35.370
Full coup.

48:37.205 --> 48:39.541
Yeah. Slide him out.

48:40.042 --> 48:41.501
Say Ken, chair?

48:41.835 --> 48:42.961
Uh...

48:43.045 --> 48:44.921
You or me, Rome, CEO?

48:45.005 --> 48:46.340
And the other one takes...

48:46.423 --> 48:49.134
whatever they want,
like studio, movies, TV...

48:50.010 --> 48:52.095
The streamer, but,
you know, equal.

48:52.179 --> 48:53.847
Okay, but really equal.

48:53.930 --> 48:55.349
Really equal.
If we do this,

48:55.432 --> 48:57.809
I don't want you two cunts
trying to big-brother me

48:57.893 --> 48:59.519
out of my fucking piece, okay?

48:59.603 --> 49:02.564
No, we can fight it out.
It'll-- It'll be fun.

49:02.648 --> 49:05.817
That will be fun.

49:06.985 --> 49:09.821
We fucking take Mussolini away
in a van to the hospital

49:09.905 --> 49:11.365
take over the radio stations.

49:12.324 --> 49:13.367
Oh, fuck.

49:14.576 --> 49:17.162
I do think that,

49:17.245 --> 49:18.914
even though this literally
makes me wanna vomit

49:18.997 --> 49:20.290
and I wanna kill you both
every day

49:20.374 --> 49:21.458
and it's all gonna end horribly,

49:21.541 --> 49:23.585
I do think that we...

49:23.669 --> 49:25.504
Puke!

49:25.587 --> 49:27.881
...could make
a pretty good team.

49:27.964 --> 49:32.636
So, how do we feel
about killing Dad?

49:33.553 --> 49:34.805
Mixed feelings?

49:35.889 --> 49:38.225
- Pass me the fucking shotgun.
Okay.

49:39.685 --> 49:41.645
Rome, you in?

49:44.022 --> 49:46.316
Okay. Fuck. Okay.

49:51.446 --> 49:53.615
Well, Con, this is me
layering you in.

49:53.699 --> 49:54.950
But I can't talk about this
right now

49:55.033 --> 49:56.451
because it's complicated
and I don't have time.

49:56.535 --> 49:57.703
And also you're
a little bit slow.

49:57.786 --> 49:59.079
Yeah, thanks for talking.

49:59.162 --> 50:01.039
I just wanna triple-check
the holding company
by-law shit.

50:02.624 --> 50:04.918
veto on the change of control.

50:05.001 --> 50:06.878
It's from the divorce,
so stop that,

50:06.962 --> 50:09.339
and the deal collapses,
he's impotent.

50:09.423 --> 50:10.674
We're gonna force him out.

50:10.757 --> 50:13.885
Fuck, okay. Uh-huh.

50:13.969 --> 50:15.762
And where do I fit in, Shiv?

50:15.846 --> 50:18.014
Well, high up, Tom,
I don't know. It--

50:18.098 --> 50:20.934
We'll figure it out,
though. There's a lot going on.

50:21.017 --> 50:22.394
No, sure, sure, okay.

50:22.477 --> 50:24.771
Uh-- But-- But-- But--
But, uh, high?

50:24.855 --> 50:26.815
But, Tom, once we do it,
right away,

50:26.898 --> 50:28.650
we're gonna offer him
the medical card,

50:28.734 --> 50:30.277
secure the imperial guard,

50:30.360 --> 50:32.320
tell him that he needs
to take some rest,

50:32.404 --> 50:34.614
and, sourced to us kids,

50:34.698 --> 50:36.783
we'll get ATN to confirm.

50:36.867 --> 50:39.995
Say like, uh,
"Founder Logan Roy Ailing,"

50:40.078 --> 50:41.121
uh, "Prayers for the big man.

50:41.204 --> 50:42.748
Thinking of taking
a step back".

50:42.831 --> 50:44.750
So, we can cite you as sources?

50:44.833 --> 50:47.335
- Yeah?
- Yeah. And we'll stand it up.

50:49.296 --> 50:50.297
Get ready, okay?

50:50.380 --> 50:51.965
Jesus. Okay.

50:52.048 --> 50:53.216
Good luck.

50:54.050 --> 50:55.552
- Bye.
Mm-hmm.

50:58.054 --> 50:59.890
He's in?
- Yeah.

51:06.021 --> 51:07.105
Hey, Tommy.

51:07.981 --> 51:08.940
-

51:09.024 --> 51:10.192
Hey.

51:10.275 --> 51:11.777
Say hello to someone

51:11.860 --> 51:14.154
who could be Logan's ex-wife's

51:14.237 --> 51:16.531
step-cousin-in-law
and heir apparent

51:16.615 --> 51:19.075
to the Grand Duchy
of Luxembourg.

51:19.159 --> 51:21.244
Twelve times removed
or some shit.

51:21.328 --> 51:23.538
And potential count of somewhere

51:23.622 --> 51:27.000
and legitimate claimant
to the dormant throne of Italy.

51:28.084 --> 51:29.294
What, Greg?

51:29.377 --> 51:30.962
Me and the contessa.

51:31.046 --> 51:32.047
We're hitting it off.

51:32.130 --> 51:33.632
She's having
an existential crisis

51:33.715 --> 51:34.758
about her personal branding

51:34.841 --> 51:37.344
and I'm right in there
to wheedle away.

51:37.427 --> 51:38.595
What about...

51:39.721 --> 51:40.972
Comfrey?
- Yeah.

51:41.056 --> 51:44.893
Comfrey might be helping her
refresh her personal branding.

51:44.976 --> 51:47.562
And I-- I don't actually think
she's that into me.

51:47.646 --> 51:49.397
We're separate-bedding.

51:49.481 --> 51:50.816
It's a guilt-free switch-up.

51:51.233 --> 51:52.275
Case closed.

51:53.068 --> 51:54.319
Slam it shut.

51:54.402 --> 51:56.029
The verdict is love, Your Honor.

51:59.241 --> 52:00.242
Greg, listen.

52:04.913 --> 52:05.997
What's up?

52:06.581 --> 52:07.707
So...

52:10.126 --> 52:12.212
things may be in motion.

52:12.879 --> 52:14.297
As in...

52:14.381 --> 52:16.424
- Is anyone going to jail?
No.

52:19.010 --> 52:21.304
No. So, um...

52:22.722 --> 52:24.057
do you wanna come with me?

52:24.850 --> 52:26.184
Sporus?

52:26.268 --> 52:28.144
Can I ask
for a little more information?

52:28.770 --> 52:29.771
No.

52:30.355 --> 52:31.523
Don't think so.

52:33.900 --> 52:36.987
I might need you
as my attack dog.

52:38.321 --> 52:40.615
Right.
- Like, um, a Greg-weiler.

52:40.699 --> 52:42.284
Hmm.

52:42.367 --> 52:44.035
Tom's attack dog.

52:45.662 --> 52:46.663
Nice.

52:47.122 --> 52:48.290
Uh-- I mean,

52:49.457 --> 52:52.419
I have Brightstar Buffalo
in my hip pocket,

52:52.502 --> 52:54.796
I'm kind of a big deal, so...

52:54.880 --> 52:57.591
You fucked yourself
before congress, Greg.

52:57.674 --> 52:59.175
That-- That's your opinion.

52:59.259 --> 53:01.428
"I don't recall,
Your Honor, I don't recall--"

53:01.511 --> 53:02.721
You're a fucking joke, man.

53:05.724 --> 53:10.979
Who has ever looked after you
in this fucking family, huh?

53:16.067 --> 53:18.111
All right, uh, well,
in terms of...

53:18.194 --> 53:20.280
...where I could be...

53:20.363 --> 53:23.283
getting to
if I were to come with?

53:23.366 --> 53:27.621
You could be heading away
from the endless middle

53:27.704 --> 53:30.415
and towards
the bottom of the top.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.292
The bottom of the top?

53:36.171 --> 53:38.173
Um-- Could I get my own...

53:39.424 --> 53:40.634
my own, like--

53:40.717 --> 53:42.302
- Your own Greg?
Yeah.

53:42.385 --> 53:43.678
You can have 20.

53:46.056 --> 53:48.141
Listen, I-- I have things to do.

53:48.224 --> 53:49.809
Um...

53:49.893 --> 53:52.395
Do you want a deal
with the devil?

53:55.148 --> 53:56.691
Well...

54:00.904 --> 54:03.031
What am I gonna do
with a soul anyways?

54:06.242 --> 54:08.536
- Souls are boring.

54:08.620 --> 54:10.497
- Boo, souls.

54:11.164 --> 54:12.248
Of course.

54:19.756 --> 54:20.757
- Okay.
- Okay.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.092
- All right.
- All right.

54:40.402 --> 54:41.778
Maybe he's napping.

54:42.862 --> 54:44.948
Yeah, then worse
to wake him up.

54:52.414 --> 54:53.999
- We're good?
- Yeah, yeah.

54:55.333 --> 54:57.043
I'm good. You good, Rome?

54:57.377 --> 54:58.378
Yeah.

54:58.461 --> 54:59.879
You can handle this?

54:59.963 --> 55:01.965
Been basically planning it
since we were four.

55:03.591 --> 55:05.802
What if dad flutters
his eyelids at you, Rome?

55:05.885 --> 55:06.928
You gonna melt?

55:07.012 --> 55:09.055
Me? No.

55:09.139 --> 55:11.766
As long as you guys
don't go water pistols in Bali.

55:11.850 --> 55:13.476
Water pistols in Bali?

55:13.560 --> 55:14.728
Yeah, water pistols in Bali.

55:14.811 --> 55:17.605
When we were all gonna go squirt
Dad under the canopy?

55:17.689 --> 55:20.275
I went in, and you fucks
left me for dead?

55:20.358 --> 55:21.609
I don't recall.

55:21.693 --> 55:22.819
That's convenient.

55:26.614 --> 55:28.199
Hey, Dad!

55:28.283 --> 55:30.201
Shiv Roy. We're going in.

55:34.122 --> 55:38.001
Okay, yeah, excuse me,
lawyery man, may I see that?

55:38.084 --> 55:39.085
Uh, no.

55:39.169 --> 55:40.754
Okay, uh, where's my dad?
Logan? Logan Roy?

55:40.837 --> 55:42.088
I don't know,
I haven't seen him.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.423
Oh, you haven't seen him.
That's convenient.

55:43.506 --> 55:44.632
He hasn't seen him.

55:46.217 --> 55:47.218
Guys.

55:51.765 --> 55:53.016
Well, look who it is.

55:56.686 --> 55:57.937
Hey, we're going in.

55:58.813 --> 55:59.773
Oh.

56:00.815 --> 56:02.108
Send them in!

56:03.860 --> 56:05.153
Okay, um...

56:07.322 --> 56:08.990
- Hey.
Hey!

56:10.075 --> 56:11.284
Hello. Hello.

56:11.367 --> 56:13.787
- What's all this, then?
Hi. Hi everyone. Hi.

56:13.870 --> 56:15.413
Hey, Karl.
Hi.

56:15.497 --> 56:18.208
Uh-- We're just feeling a little
out of the loop, Dad.

56:18.291 --> 56:20.085
Oh, of course.
Things have moved very fast.

56:20.168 --> 56:21.503
Come in, come in, come in.

56:21.586 --> 56:23.004
Um...

56:23.088 --> 56:25.131
Yeah, we might be wrong,

56:25.215 --> 56:26.299
but we're, uh,

56:26.382 --> 56:28.384
we're hearing rumors about GoJo.

56:28.468 --> 56:29.969
Yeah, that, uh,

56:30.053 --> 56:31.763
we might be the target now.

56:31.846 --> 56:33.389
Is that right, Dad?

56:33.473 --> 56:35.934
Okay. I've been looking
at some options.

56:36.017 --> 56:38.520
Right. We might be affected,
our positions,

56:38.603 --> 56:39.979
so we wanted
to get some clarity.

56:40.063 --> 56:42.273
Absolutely. But do you mind
not with him in here

56:42.357 --> 56:44.317
giving me
the fucking doggy-evils?

56:46.319 --> 56:48.446
Can you take him out, Romulus?

56:48.530 --> 56:51.116
I'll fill in your sister
and give you the angles.

56:51.199 --> 56:53.451
I don't trust him.

56:59.040 --> 57:00.125
Roman?

57:00.208 --> 57:01.918
You can tell us together, Dad.

57:03.294 --> 57:04.838
I thought we had this
figured out.

57:06.005 --> 57:08.424
Yeah. It just might be better,
you know, if...

57:09.300 --> 57:10.510
we all hear.

57:12.262 --> 57:13.304
Okay.

57:13.388 --> 57:15.890
So, the market capitalizations
of our firms

57:15.974 --> 57:17.183
have been on the move.

57:17.267 --> 57:18.726
Ours is a declining business.

57:18.810 --> 57:21.020
There's a wave
of consolidations happening

57:21.104 --> 57:25.358
that mean this is the optimal
moment, in my opinion,

57:25.900 --> 57:27.652
uh, to make a deal

57:27.735 --> 57:30.655
with a serious tech operation

57:30.738 --> 57:31.865
like GoJo.

57:31.948 --> 57:34.659
And that's what
I've been exploring, okay?

57:34.742 --> 57:38.746
Okay, so, I would say, uh,
on behalf of all of us,

57:38.830 --> 57:41.416
uh, can you ease up
and let us in,

57:41.499 --> 57:43.835
stop this until we see exactly
how we're impacted?

57:43.918 --> 57:45.378
No, it has to be now.

57:45.461 --> 57:47.797
- Why?
- Because I feel it in my bones.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.049
Oh, wow,
no arguing with that, huh?

57:50.133 --> 57:52.385
End of the day,
that's all I fucking got.

57:52.468 --> 57:53.720
Well, you know that's bullshit.

57:53.803 --> 57:57.390
Look, this is the best moment
to sell.

57:57.473 --> 57:59.559
If I don't do the best deal
at any given point,

57:59.642 --> 58:00.894
what's the point of anything?

58:00.977 --> 58:04.272
I don't get out, I leave
five billion on the table.

58:04.355 --> 58:05.356
Come on, Dad!

58:05.440 --> 58:08.234
What are you gonna do
with the five bil? Huh?

58:08.318 --> 58:10.778
Put it on your pile
with all your other fucking bil?

58:12.030 --> 58:13.531
Mm-hmm. Probably. Yeah.

58:13.615 --> 58:14.991
And what are we supposed to do?

58:15.074 --> 58:18.119
Make your own fucking pile.

58:19.787 --> 58:22.207
I know this is a readjustment,

58:22.290 --> 58:25.585
but our blood's in the water
and I need to make moves fast

58:25.668 --> 58:28.838
in order to control
the situation and get myself

58:28.922 --> 58:30.882
and you...

58:30.965 --> 58:32.759
...assurances for the future.

58:32.842 --> 58:36.221
Dad, once Matsson is calling
the shots, we're fucked.

58:36.304 --> 58:38.223
No, nah, he rates you.

58:38.306 --> 58:40.725
And this is an opportunity
for you kids

58:40.808 --> 58:42.602
to get an education...

58:42.685 --> 58:43.770
in real life.

58:43.853 --> 58:45.563
With you at the top,
we can take over,

58:45.647 --> 58:47.232
but without you, we're fucked.

58:49.192 --> 58:50.360
Come on, Roman.

58:52.487 --> 58:55.198
Let's get away
from these fucking Jacobins.

58:55.281 --> 58:56.950
I've got you. Come on,
let's discuss.

58:57.033 --> 58:59.410
Hey, Dad, I--
I know what he said,

58:59.494 --> 59:01.454
I was there, but, um,

59:01.537 --> 59:03.248
really, with Matsson
calling the shots,

59:03.331 --> 59:05.333
we're-- we're strung up
in the town square.

59:05.416 --> 59:06.417
No!

59:06.876 --> 59:07.961
He rates you!

59:08.670 --> 59:10.046
You have my word.

59:11.506 --> 59:13.049
This is an opportunity, son.

59:13.841 --> 59:15.134
A bit of fucking grit.

59:15.843 --> 59:17.887
Adversity, like me.

59:17.971 --> 59:19.264
You can trust me.

59:19.347 --> 59:21.182
You can't trust him.

59:27.146 --> 59:28.106
Um...

59:30.066 --> 59:32.193
We're here to say,
the three of us,

59:32.277 --> 59:34.779
to ask and to say

59:36.447 --> 59:38.241
do not do this, please.

59:44.789 --> 59:46.791
And what if I decide
I can't listen to you?

59:46.874 --> 59:48.334
We can stop you,

59:48.418 --> 59:51.087
and we will stop you.
Blow this up.

59:51.170 --> 59:53.089
You need our vote
for a change of control.

59:53.172 --> 59:55.675
Yeah. You need all of us.

59:55.758 --> 59:59.345
You need a super majority,
and we can kill it.

59:59.429 --> 1:00:00.680
And we will.

1:00:00.763 --> 1:00:03.308
You're playing
toy fucking soldiers!

1:00:06.060 --> 1:00:07.061
Go on!

1:00:07.562 --> 1:00:08.604
Fuck off!

1:00:09.981 --> 1:00:12.150
I have you beat!

1:00:12.650 --> 1:00:15.570
You f-- morons!

1:00:15.653 --> 1:00:18.239
Well, no, because you need
a super majority--

1:00:18.323 --> 1:00:19.407
Oh, well, no!

1:00:19.490 --> 1:00:21.576
Because you need
a super majority to...

1:00:26.539 --> 1:00:28.207
Uh-- Is she still on?

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:29.751
It's all done.

1:00:29.834 --> 1:00:31.294
Can we get her back on?

1:00:35.089 --> 1:00:36.215
Dad, what is this?

1:00:38.634 --> 1:00:39.761
Yeah.

1:00:39.844 --> 1:00:40.887
Uh-huh.

1:00:41.471 --> 1:00:42.472
Hello.

1:00:43.639 --> 1:00:45.600
<i>Hello? Yeah. Logan?</i>

1:00:45.683 --> 1:00:47.101
Caroline, you're on

1:00:47.185 --> 1:00:49.395
with Roman, Kendall,
and Siobhan.

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:51.314
- Hi, Mom.
- Mom?

1:00:51.397 --> 1:00:53.316
<i>All right, well,
I don't necessarily wanna do</i>

1:00:53.399 --> 1:00:54.901
<i>anymore tonight, Logan.</i>

1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:01.783
Your mother and I have been
reviewing the terms of the...

1:01:02.658 --> 1:01:04.118
divorce agreement.

1:01:04.202 --> 1:01:05.286
Mom, you fucked us.

1:01:05.370 --> 1:01:06.371
And we've agreed

1:01:06.454 --> 1:01:09.207
that the arrangements
were a little...

1:01:09.290 --> 1:01:12.126
- antiquated.
- Oh, fuck, Mom, he got to you.

1:01:12.210 --> 1:01:14.087
Oh, seriously, Mom, already?

1:01:14.170 --> 1:01:15.171
- What the fuck did you...
<i>Look,</i>

1:01:15.254 --> 1:01:17.882
<i>I can't get into it,
all right? I...</i>

1:01:17.965 --> 1:01:20.051
<i>I think everything will be fine.</i>

1:01:20.134 --> 1:01:22.095
<i>Rex Hendon's
dealing with it all.</i>

1:01:22.178 --> 1:01:23.888
Mom, you just slit our throats.

1:01:23.971 --> 1:01:26.224
<i>Please don't be angry. I...</i>

1:01:26.307 --> 1:01:27.850
<i>I think this is for the best.</i>

1:01:27.934 --> 1:01:29.852
<i>Peter's so excited.</i>

1:01:29.936 --> 1:01:32.271
Oh, is he?
Peter's excited. Great.

1:01:32.355 --> 1:01:35.525
<i>I'm not sure it's been
good for you, all the, you know.</i>

1:01:35.608 --> 1:01:37.735
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

1:01:37.819 --> 1:01:38.903
<i>I love you all. Bye.</i>

1:01:38.986 --> 1:01:41.697
Well, we just walked in
on Mom and Dad fucking us.

1:01:41.781 --> 1:01:43.116
Thank you, Caroline.

1:01:49.831 --> 1:01:50.832
Dad...

1:01:53.418 --> 1:01:55.044
- please?
- Please?

1:01:55.128 --> 1:01:56.087
Please.

1:01:56.170 --> 1:01:58.464
The seat sniffer
gets a fucking leg up.

1:01:59.882 --> 1:02:01.300
That's a deal.

1:02:01.384 --> 1:02:03.469
What have you got
in your fucking hand?

1:02:04.429 --> 1:02:05.721
What have I got?

1:02:06.597 --> 1:02:08.391
I don't know, fucking...

1:02:08.474 --> 1:02:09.559
love?

1:02:10.059 --> 1:02:11.102
Love?

1:02:12.061 --> 1:02:14.439
You come for me...

1:02:14.981 --> 1:02:15.982
with love?

1:02:17.024 --> 1:02:19.777
You bust in here, guns in hand,

1:02:19.861 --> 1:02:22.530
and now you find they've
turned to fucking sausages.

1:02:23.948 --> 1:02:27.326
You talk about love?

1:02:31.539 --> 1:02:32.915
You should have trusted me.

1:02:35.042 --> 1:02:37.128
- Dad, why?
- Why?

1:02:38.671 --> 1:02:39.839
Because it works.

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:45.803
I fucking win.

1:02:47.430 --> 1:02:50.016
Oh, go on, go on. Fuck off.

1:02:50.099 --> 1:02:52.560
You nosy fucking pedestrians.

1:02:52.643 --> 1:02:54.437
Dad.
Hey.

1:02:58.316 --> 1:03:00.318
Mr. Roy. Mr. Roy.
Mr. Roy, hold on a second.

1:03:00.401 --> 1:03:02.862
- I need you to sign...
- Who the fuck told him?

1:03:02.945 --> 1:03:05.072
Who told him
that we were coming?

1:03:05.156 --> 1:03:06.282
Gerri, Gerri, Gerri, Gerri!

1:03:07.575 --> 1:03:08.659
He's not well.

1:03:08.743 --> 1:03:10.369
You can help us, right?
You can help us stop him?

1:03:10.453 --> 1:03:12.663
Well, I'm focused on...

1:03:12.747 --> 1:03:15.082
whatever outcome best serves
the financial interest

1:03:15.166 --> 1:03:16.751
of the shareholders
of the company.

1:03:17.919 --> 1:03:19.837
But it doesn't serve
my interests.

1:03:19.921 --> 1:03:21.756
How does it serve my interests?

1:03:24.842 --> 1:03:26.719
- Later.
Okay.

1:03:27.094 --> 1:03:28.763
Ah...

1:03:37.146 --> 1:03:38.147
Hey, Shiv.

1:03:38.773 --> 1:03:40.149
You okay?

1:03:40.233 --> 1:03:41.651
- Hey.
Hey.

1:03:45.613 --> 1:03:46.864
Yeah. Uh...

1:03:47.740 --> 1:03:48.866
You okay?

1:03:52.787 --> 1:03:53.996
Yeah.

1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:56.791
- What's going on?
- Mom fucked us.

1:03:57.166 --> 1:03:58.167
What?

1:04:10.763 --> 1:04:11.764
Hey.

1:04:14.850 --> 1:04:16.852
Hey.
