00:20.174 --> 00:21.153
(Nick laughing)

00:21.186 --> 00:22.339
- What's so funny?

00:23.245 --> 00:24.970
- Ah, super heroes.

00:24.970 --> 00:27.760
They've got the funniest
comebacks for bad guys.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.050
All right, listen to this one.

00:29.050 --> 00:30.920
He like throws a whole house at the guy

00:30.920 --> 00:32.887
and says, "This one's on the house."

00:32.887 --> 00:35.100
Ya get it?
- Yeah great.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.943
Nick, why do you read that crap?

00:38.020 --> 00:39.890
- Dude they're hysterical.

00:39.890 --> 00:41.560
Seriously Roach, if you
had like a super power,

00:41.560 --> 00:43.040
what would you have?

00:43.040 --> 00:45.090
- Already got me a super power.

00:45.090 --> 00:47.483
Whatever I touch turns to gold.

00:48.836 --> 00:49.669
- Shaddup.

00:49.669 --> 00:53.717
- That's the one with the hand, um, Midas.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.090
- Glove.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.324
- It's not a glove.

00:57.324 --> 00:59.552
- It's like it's a bracer, it's brace--

00:59.552 --> 01:00.800
- What is a bracer?

01:00.800 --> 01:01.760
I don't think it's--

01:01.760 --> 01:03.320
- What the hell are you going on about?

01:03.320 --> 01:05.129
- [Nick] Mikey, what would your power be?

01:05.129 --> 01:06.700
- Well, I'd choose invisibility.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.580
- [Nick] But how would you catch

01:07.580 --> 01:09.320
a bad guy with invisibility?

01:09.320 --> 01:11.530
And you'd have people like
running into you all the time.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.363
- They wouldn't walk into you,

01:12.363 --> 01:13.340
they'd walk right through you.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.420
- No no no, you're thinking
of like a ghost or a specter.

01:15.420 --> 01:16.253
- No!

01:16.345 --> 01:18.392
- But then again, how would
you catch a bad guy like--

01:18.455 --> 01:19.288
- Enough!

01:19.338 --> 01:21.691
What are you, 12?
- Ah!

01:21.699 --> 01:24.790
- Throw that out the window. -
Don't, it's a first edition, okay?

01:24.823 --> 01:26.570
- You'll thank me for it later.

01:26.570 --> 01:27.650
It's time to grow up.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.815
Hey, get your A game face on?

01:29.815 --> 01:30.983
- Right.

01:31.928 --> 01:33.190
- [Roach] How do you do this?

01:33.190 --> 01:34.370
- It doesn't open from inside.

01:34.370 --> 01:35.203
- [Mike] I got it.

01:35.203 --> 01:37.260
- What do you mean it
doesn't open from the inside?

01:37.260 --> 01:38.423
- It's an old car.

01:40.572 --> 01:44.573
It's my grandma's, I'm just borrowing it.

01:44.573 --> 01:46.160
The stereo works though.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.333
Sorry, it was locked.

01:52.030 --> 01:54.720
Hey Mikey, will you get
me like an energy drink,

01:54.720 --> 01:56.990
and like the spreadable
like cracker things?

01:56.990 --> 01:59.360
- Yeah, cheese or peanut butter?

01:59.360 --> 02:01.622
- Oh, peanut butter,
yeah, I'm not European.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.640
- Just keep the car running.

02:03.640 --> 02:04.637
- Okay, cool.

02:04.637 --> 02:05.470
(car engine starting)

02:10.961 --> 02:12.462
( Action Music playing)

02:14.997 --> 02:16.580
Hey did you get my crackers and drink?

02:16.580 --> 02:17.933
- Drive now!
- Man we gotta go!

02:17.933 --> 02:20.225
- Is that the cops coming?
- Just do it!

02:20.225 --> 02:22.345
- Come on!!
- Okay!

02:22.345 --> 02:23.610
- What are you doing?

02:23.610 --> 02:24.716
- Just give me a second!

02:24.716 --> 02:26.340
She has the right of way!

02:26.340 --> 02:28.198
(police sirens wailing)

02:28.198 --> 02:30.293
- Nick, I swear, I will end you.

02:30.293 --> 02:32.447
- Okay, well this isn't helping.

02:32.447 --> 02:33.900
- [Mike] Alright, alright, alright!

02:33.900 --> 02:35.704
- Here we go, here we go!

02:35.704 --> 02:36.997
(Nick exclaiming wordlessly)

02:36.997 --> 02:38.040
(Nick screaming in frustration)

02:38.040 --> 02:40.492
- Nick you picked the worst
getaway car in the history of

02:40.492 --> 02:42.200
robberies! - I didn't know
we were robbing this place.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.945
- [Mike] Guys, I'm outta
here. - [Nick] See ya Mike.

02:43.945 --> 02:46.053
(police siren wailing)

02:46.053 --> 02:48.090
Roach!
- Why won't this door open?

02:48.090 --> 02:49.840
- [Nick] It's broken!

02:51.970 --> 02:52.887
I got this.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.103
- You're on your own dumbass.

02:56.103 --> 02:57.883
- Fine, I'll get away by myself.

02:57.883 --> 02:59.820
(car engine grinding ineffectively)

02:59.820 --> 03:02.487
(siren wailing)

03:05.060 --> 03:07.663
- Get out of the vehicle
with your hands raised.

03:10.730 --> 03:12.333
Exit the vehicle.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.333
Slowly put your hands on your back.

03:21.470 --> 03:24.820
- Is that a baton or are you
just happy to see me, officer?

03:24.820 --> 03:27.003
- Is that supposed to be funny?

03:27.720 --> 03:29.995
- [Nick] It was supposed to be.

03:29.995 --> 03:32.828
(energetic music)

05:13.170 --> 05:17.210
- [Lawyer] The bad news
is, we're losing the case.

05:17.210 --> 05:19.570
- Alright, then just
skip to the good news.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.190
- The good news is is that if you give

05:21.190 --> 05:23.410
up your accomplices the judge may

05:23.410 --> 05:25.370
give you a lighter sentence.

05:25.370 --> 05:27.280
- That still sounds like bad news.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.860
I don't have accomplices,
I have I have friends.

05:29.860 --> 05:32.600
And I didn't know that those
guys were gonna rob that place.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.913
- Look, I made a diagram.

05:36.100 --> 05:39.410
Your best chance is to
give up your friends.

05:39.410 --> 05:41.313
- I'm not giving up my friends.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.240
- There's nothing else I can do for you.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.310
- With a jury of your
peers finding you guilty

05:47.310 --> 05:49.060
of aiding in an armed robbery,

05:49.060 --> 05:51.150
I hereby sentence you to five years

05:51.150 --> 05:54.067
in Carlson Minimum Security Prison.

06:00.686 --> 06:03.611
(sultry music)

06:03.927 --> 06:06.277
(singing in foreign language)

06:22.311 --> 06:23.590
(gavel hitting wood)

06:23.590 --> 06:25.310
- What? It's over?

06:25.310 --> 06:27.100
- Five years, Carlson.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.620
- Do something!

06:28.620 --> 06:30.020
- You should probably pay attention.

06:30.020 --> 06:32.830
This is the next five years of your life.

06:32.830 --> 06:33.833
- You're so fired.

06:34.750 --> 06:39.410
- My dear Lord Jesus, I
pray that my correspondence

06:39.410 --> 06:44.410
to Nick will arrive safely
in the warm comfort,

06:45.430 --> 06:49.595
the safe, the learning
environment of prison.

06:49.595 --> 06:52.594
Amen.

06:52.594 --> 06:55.427
(camera clicking)

06:57.162 --> 06:58.390
(Maryanne sighing)

06:59.790 --> 07:01.130
- [Randall] You're not playing right now.

07:01.130 --> 07:02.950
What are you doing?

07:02.950 --> 07:03.823
- Where you at?

07:03.823 --> 07:04.656
You wanna another, all right.

07:04.656 --> 07:06.323
- Hey Randall.
- Yeah.

07:08.385 --> 07:09.802
- Check this out.

07:11.114 --> 07:11.947
- Ooh!

07:11.947 --> 07:14.638
- [Nick] Isn't that the prettiest
half a face you ever saw?

07:14.663 --> 07:16.228
- Oh man, is this your lady?

07:16.228 --> 07:20.512
- That's her, that's waiting for me.

07:20.512 --> 07:21.770
- Not bad Nick.

07:21.770 --> 07:24.070
Hold on though, I got
something better for ya.

07:25.826 --> 07:30.050
If we do, check out that action.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.263
- [Nick] Oh yeah.

07:37.185 --> 07:39.110
- We are gathered here today

07:39.110 --> 07:42.680
to join this inmate and Maryanne--

07:42.680 --> 07:43.930
- Oh do you mind if we...

07:50.140 --> 07:52.010
- In holy matrimony.

07:52.010 --> 07:55.380
Does anyone have a clue why
these two should be married?

07:55.380 --> 07:57.234
Speak now or we may never know.

07:57.234 --> 07:59.034
(Brandy clearing her throat)

08:02.984 --> 08:06.317
(tattoo needle buzzing)

08:07.833 --> 08:10.750
- The first time I saw you, typing away

08:10.750 --> 08:12.450
on that little miniature keyboard,

08:13.970 --> 08:18.003
with that hair, and those eyes,

08:20.300 --> 08:21.890
I thought God had sent an angel

08:22.780 --> 08:24.870
down from heaven to that courtroom

08:25.870 --> 08:29.528
just to shoot a lightning
bolt right into my loins.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.320
- I never saw a man look so good in orange

08:33.320 --> 08:34.370
who wasn't an autumn.

08:36.770 --> 08:37.970
I saw you in that courtroom

08:37.970 --> 08:40.500
and I didn't care what you had done.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.013
I knew you had a good heart.

08:42.860 --> 08:46.090
It was as if the Lord Jesus himself

08:46.090 --> 08:48.280
came down from heaven and slapped me

08:49.213 --> 08:53.740
with his holy hand and
said, "Girl, he's the one."

08:54.752 --> 08:56.443
- Do we have any rings?

08:56.968 --> 08:59.395
- I'm almost done, just
gimme a few seconds here.

09:05.110 --> 09:07.430
- Now, but the power vested in me,

09:07.430 --> 09:10.620
I pronounce you man and wife.

09:10.620 --> 09:12.303
You may kiss the bride.

09:17.094 --> 09:19.418
(buzzer buzzing)

09:19.418 --> 09:20.800
- Hola!

09:20.800 --> 09:21.860
Getting out today.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.110
- Name.

09:23.110 --> 09:24.090
- Osmond.

09:24.090 --> 09:26.507
Nicholas Osmond, no relation.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.683
- Oh and we're gonna
need your inmate attire.

09:32.910 --> 09:35.310
You can actually change down the hall.

09:35.310 --> 09:37.160
- Ah nothing you haven't seen before.

09:41.270 --> 09:42.460
- See ya next week?

09:42.460 --> 09:43.410
- Have a nice life.

09:47.331 --> 09:48.164
Maryanne!

09:48.164 --> 09:50.497
- [Man On Loudspeaker] Walk!

10:00.085 --> 10:01.120
- We've got some celebrating to do!

10:01.120 --> 10:02.550
- You know it baby!

10:02.550 --> 10:03.770
- Whoa, no!

10:03.770 --> 10:04.870
Slow down.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.630
First, I've got a surprise for you.

10:07.630 --> 10:10.200
- Oh, what is it?

10:10.200 --> 10:12.450
- We're going over to
my sister's for dinner.

10:18.790 --> 10:20.230
- Okay.

10:20.230 --> 10:24.450
I just got out, like, don't you wanna,

10:24.450 --> 10:26.373
don't you wanna hop in the back there?

10:27.571 --> 10:31.400
- Well, yeah, but
Brandy's making pot roast

10:31.400 --> 10:35.970
and I have to get the van
back before it gets dark.

10:35.970 --> 10:37.911
- I can keep it under a minute, I can,

10:37.911 --> 10:40.390
- Oh maybe I want it more than a minute.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.800
Later!

10:41.800 --> 10:42.850
Put your seatbelt on.

10:45.150 --> 10:45.983
- Fine.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.220
- I promise it will be good.

10:49.220 --> 10:51.545
- The sex or the pot roast?

10:52.340 --> 10:53.173
- Both.

10:57.364 --> 11:01.388
(Nick yelling)
(children screaming)

11:01.388 --> 11:02.638
- Knock it off!

11:04.403 --> 11:06.863
Get off of your uncle Nick!

11:06.863 --> 11:09.620
- But we're having a good time.

11:09.620 --> 11:12.521
- I'm not yelling for my health here.

11:12.521 --> 11:15.150
- I'm going down, I'm going
down! (children giggling)

11:15.150 --> 11:18.733
- These kids are sucking
the life outta me!

11:22.800 --> 11:26.460
- Lord Jesus, we offer
our thanks for this bounty

11:26.460 --> 11:28.200
thou has set before us.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.523
And for the return of my
beloved Nick from prison.

11:34.690 --> 11:38.370
Now that he is a free
man, I ask that you bless

11:38.370 --> 11:41.720
the fruit of his loins and open my womb

11:41.720 --> 11:44.880
that I may soon be heavy with his child.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.140
In your holy name, amen.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.793
- Amen.
- Amen.

11:49.950 --> 11:52.097
- Mama, what are fruit loins?

11:53.277 --> 11:56.260
- Are you trying to make
my job as a mother harder?

11:56.260 --> 11:57.093
- Sorry.

11:57.093 --> 11:58.370
- No more questions, Wendy.

11:58.370 --> 12:01.570
- Did Uncle Nick bring
his fruit for desserts?

12:01.570 --> 12:04.050
- Yes, I did, but not enough for everyone.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.563
Just only Maryanne.

12:10.110 --> 12:12.603
- Was Brandy's pot roast
better than prison food?

12:15.225 --> 12:17.313
- Mm, I'm thinking.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.483
No, not about pot roast.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.390
I'm wondering if I'm cut out to be a dad.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.033
- Of course.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.133
Why do you ask?

12:35.530 --> 12:37.933
- I've read like hundreds of comic books.

12:40.930 --> 12:42.380
And I really wanna be a hero.

12:45.620 --> 12:47.690
But I've never done
anything to be deserving

12:47.690 --> 12:48.523
of the title.

12:54.810 --> 12:56.453
And with this kid on the way,

13:01.310 --> 13:06.130
I'm just wondering if I'm
up for the fatherly heroics.

13:06.130 --> 13:10.973
With great responsibility
comes, something.

13:19.201 --> 13:23.784
I just don't want to screw
it up the way my dad did us.

13:25.075 --> 13:30.075
- You're gonna be a great dad.

13:44.777 --> 13:45.610
- Nick!

13:55.640 --> 13:58.270
- Hey Roach, how are you bud?

13:58.270 --> 13:59.750
- How long has it been, Nicky?

13:59.750 --> 14:04.420
- It's been three years,
two off with good behavior.

14:04.420 --> 14:05.540
- Oh yeah.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.360
Big Head said you were getting out soon.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.010
- Yeah, pretty recently actually.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.110
But I want you to know
I didn't say anything--

14:13.110 --> 14:16.090
- Hey, water under the bridge, Nicky.

14:16.090 --> 14:18.663
Water under the bridge for both of us.

14:19.530 --> 14:21.320
- Sure, for both of us, yeah.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.840
- Hey, you know what, I
got something to show ya.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.793
Right there.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.780
- WYN Enterprises.

14:29.780 --> 14:30.950
- That's right.

14:30.950 --> 14:32.850
- Stands for Whatever You Need.

14:32.850 --> 14:33.793
I'm legit now.

14:35.270 --> 14:36.253
- Good for you.

14:37.870 --> 14:39.853
- So, uh, what's new with you?

14:41.660 --> 14:43.123
- Just married life.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.460
- Married?
- Yeah.

14:45.460 --> 14:48.020
- Nicky, who would marry you?

14:48.020 --> 14:49.440
No but seriously, good for you.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.720
And if you're looking for protection,

14:51.720 --> 14:56.030
I got a bead on some primo
Canadian dink sheathes.

14:56.030 --> 14:58.630
- Dink sheets.
- Not sheets, sheathes.

14:58.630 --> 14:59.590
Rubbers Nicky.

14:59.590 --> 15:00.965
- Oh, yeah, no.

15:00.965 --> 15:02.250
Hah! (laughs) Yeah.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.090
Rubbers right.

15:03.090 --> 15:04.270
No, we're not doing that.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.730
We're doing the, we're
doing the bare back.

15:06.730 --> 15:09.000
We're doing it Adam
and Eve style, ya know,

15:09.000 --> 15:10.810
Genesis, Old Testament.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.600
The Mrs, she's really
into the Holy Bible thing.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.833
So we're doing it without sheathes.

15:15.910 --> 15:17.762
Got this instead.
- Oh, alright.

15:17.762 --> 15:18.595
(Nick laughs)

15:18.595 --> 15:21.510
Nick, you dog, you trying to
knock up your old lady, huh?

15:21.510 --> 15:22.940
- She's actually young, ow.

15:22.940 --> 15:23.773
She's younger than me.

15:23.773 --> 15:25.980
- Ah that's great, good for you man.

15:25.980 --> 15:28.401
Remember what I told
you, whatever you need.

15:28.401 --> 15:29.234
- Uh huh, I've got the card.

15:29.234 --> 15:30.727
- I mean whatever.
- Right.

15:30.727 --> 15:32.150
- But listen you gotta take off,

15:32.150 --> 15:33.810
I'm meeting somebody here, so...

15:33.810 --> 15:36.060
- Oh I'm, oh yeah, I'll leave.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.063
Cool, see ya.

15:40.645 --> 15:41.562
- Dickweed.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.862
- Oh Nick, I think tonight's the night.

15:47.862 --> 15:48.695
- Yeah?

15:48.695 --> 15:49.528
- Mm hmm.

15:57.603 --> 15:59.263
- How'd that get under here?

16:00.190 --> 16:04.800
- Oh, um, I read online that
this, this lady in Idaho,

16:04.800 --> 16:07.100
she puts one underneath
her pillow every time

16:07.100 --> 16:09.050
she wants to get pregnant and it works.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.840
- All right!

16:11.840 --> 16:14.155
We're doing it internet Idaho style!

16:14.155 --> 16:16.693
(Maryanne giggles)

16:16.693 --> 16:18.790
- I don't know why, but for some reason,

16:18.790 --> 16:20.064
that makes me really hot.

16:20.064 --> 16:21.300
- Then we need to get your clothes off.

16:21.300 --> 16:22.133
- Okay.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.389
Come on, get 'em off!

16:25.389 --> 16:26.935
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay.

16:26.935 --> 16:29.935
(Maryanne giggling)

16:32.040 --> 16:33.363
- You coming back to bed?

16:34.340 --> 16:37.070
- [Maryanne] Just a couple more minutes.

16:37.070 --> 16:41.953
- Okay, I think I'm
just gonna hit the sack.

16:41.953 --> 16:42.786
- Okay.

16:43.740 --> 16:45.200
Sleep tight sweetheart.

16:48.726 --> 16:51.309
(somber music)

17:06.460 --> 17:08.200
- Nick and Maryanne?
- Hi.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.109
- How are you today?

17:09.109 --> 17:10.190
It's nice to meet you.

17:10.190 --> 17:11.270
I'm Dr. Evans.

17:11.270 --> 17:13.339
- You come highly
recommended from my sister.

17:13.339 --> 17:14.790
- She's got tons of kids.

17:14.790 --> 17:15.623
That's what we want.

17:15.623 --> 17:18.349
We brought the minivan,
so just fill us up.

17:18.349 --> 17:20.160
- All right, I'll do my best.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.790
Well I'm gonna do a full
exam of Maryanne in here.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.803
And Nick, I will need a sample from you.

17:26.569 --> 17:29.280
- A sample of?
- Your sperm.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.030
A urine sample won't
really help us figure out

17:31.030 --> 17:32.580
why she's not getting pregnant.

17:33.810 --> 17:34.870
- You want me to...

17:35.880 --> 17:38.890
- Yes, manual stimulation
is usually the best way

17:38.890 --> 17:40.500
to do that.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.673
- I was saving those.

17:42.740 --> 17:44.610
- Well, we've gotta rule
out all possibilities.

17:44.610 --> 17:46.090
So it's not always the woman's fault

17:46.090 --> 17:48.070
that she can't get pregnant so.

17:48.070 --> 17:48.903
- Right, yeah.

17:50.826 --> 17:52.730
(Nick sighs)

17:52.730 --> 17:54.580
So uh, you can do that in public?

17:54.580 --> 17:57.200
'Cause I know guys in
prison that, you know,

17:57.200 --> 17:58.410
that's why they're there.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.380
- No not in public, no.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.630
We've set up a room at the
end of the hallway for you.

18:01.630 --> 18:04.010
That way you'll have some privacy.

18:04.010 --> 18:05.800
- Can I bring a friend?

18:05.800 --> 18:07.210
- No Maryanne needs to stay in here.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.990
I need to start her exam.

18:08.990 --> 18:12.417
- Okay, off to the masturbating room.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.030
Just come back here when you're done.

18:16.030 --> 18:18.933
Leave that in the little
cubby hole in the wall.

18:18.933 --> 18:20.050
And we'll see you in a minute.

18:20.050 --> 18:20.883
- Okay.

18:20.883 --> 18:23.137
- All right.
- Good luck!

18:23.137 --> 18:26.620
- Huh, going to touch
myself inappropriately.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.559
Doctor's orders. (laughs)

18:28.559 --> 18:29.392
Oh god.

18:33.561 --> 18:36.478
(light jazz music)

19:00.060 --> 19:02.643
(Nick sighing)

20:03.711 --> 20:05.920
- I do too take vacations.

20:05.920 --> 20:09.680
I took time off, I don't know, recently.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.580
I'm not avoiding the family I just uh,

20:12.617 --> 20:14.467
I just can't take time off right now.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.193
No, Tom, I'm sorry, it's
just, just a work thing.

20:21.580 --> 20:22.413
Okay bye.

20:28.830 --> 20:29.780
- [Nick] Mail call.

20:31.970 --> 20:32.930
- Did it come?

20:32.930 --> 20:35.845
- From the office of
Dr. Leslie Evans M.D..

20:35.845 --> 20:36.678
- Oh.

20:37.640 --> 20:38.603
Oh, you read it.

20:39.540 --> 20:40.373
I'm too nervous.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.163
Good news?

20:46.719 --> 20:51.120
- (laughs) If having a whole
armada of semen is good news,

20:51.120 --> 20:52.239
I've got some good news.

20:52.239 --> 20:53.072
- What?

20:53.072 --> 20:55.270
- Look at this, look how
many semen are in there.

20:55.270 --> 20:57.870
That's how many spermies are inside me.

20:57.870 --> 20:59.740
- Oh, okay great.

20:59.740 --> 21:01.340
What does it say about me?

21:01.340 --> 21:03.233
- Uh, it says,

21:08.810 --> 21:09.643
- Nick?

21:13.220 --> 21:16.643
- It says your uterus is
a hostile environment.

21:22.470 --> 21:24.230
- Hey, I never found
it to be that hostile.

21:24.230 --> 21:26.895
I really like it in there.
I'd spend nine months

21:26.895 --> 21:28.728
in there if I could. - Just, just stop.

21:29.410 --> 21:30.243
- It'll be okay.

21:30.243 --> 21:32.713
We'll call the adoption agency.

21:34.070 --> 21:36.193
- They don't let convicted felons adopt.

21:40.230 --> 21:41.713
- Right.

21:41.713 --> 21:43.980
- I don't know what to do.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.810
- Well, we're not gonna give up.

21:47.810 --> 21:49.650
This is too important.

21:49.650 --> 21:50.710
All right?

21:50.710 --> 21:52.560
You and I need to be parents.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.890
We need to have a god damn
kid in this house, okay?

21:54.890 --> 21:57.280
Even if we gotta do it on our own.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.230
- With help from Jesus.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.810
- Yes, with help from Jesus, obviously.

22:01.810 --> 22:04.060
We're gonna have a threesome.

22:04.060 --> 22:07.027
That's not how that was
supposed to come out.

22:12.630 --> 22:13.873
- How far along are you?

22:16.610 --> 22:18.600
- Um, what?

22:18.600 --> 22:20.050
- Come on Andrea, I can tell.

22:24.279 --> 22:25.112
- I don't know.

22:26.210 --> 22:27.120
A month?

22:27.120 --> 22:28.920
Six weeks maybe.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.670
- Am I the only person you've told?

22:32.270 --> 22:34.713
What about Mr. Wonderful?

22:36.230 --> 22:37.880
He needs to be kept in the loop.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.930
- He's no longer part of the big picture.

22:39.930 --> 22:41.630
- [Laura] And what is
the big picture Andrea?

22:41.630 --> 22:44.490
- I don't know, I'll let you
know when I figure that out.

22:44.490 --> 22:46.130
- [Laura] You can't treat this like one

22:46.130 --> 22:47.840
of your quarterly projections.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.223
- I didn't mean that I'm not
gonna figure it out, I just--

22:49.223 --> 22:51.780
- There's a person growing inside you.

22:51.780 --> 22:52.993
Do you understand that?

22:53.830 --> 22:55.460
I mean, where are your priorities?

22:55.460 --> 22:58.160
- It's a priority, I'm just
still processing the data.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.543
- You know, you have options.

23:10.170 --> 23:11.820
- I don't know, you're a single mother.

23:11.820 --> 23:13.500
- Yeah something I planned.

23:13.500 --> 23:16.570
I have a full time nanny, I
mean I got it all worked out.

23:16.570 --> 23:19.113
But, you're not ready.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.483
I think I can help.

23:25.730 --> 23:27.950
Everyone this is Andrea, my friend,

23:27.950 --> 23:30.654
who just found out she's expecting.

23:30.654 --> 23:31.980
(people clapping)

23:31.980 --> 23:33.310
- That's wonderful.

23:33.310 --> 23:35.550
Andrea, why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself.

23:35.550 --> 23:38.100
- I've been dealing with so many emotions

23:38.100 --> 23:39.163
the last few weeks.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.780
I don't even know where to begin.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.607
- Oh we call that the EU stage.

23:43.607 --> 23:44.920
- Mm hmm.

23:44.920 --> 23:45.880
- EU?

23:45.880 --> 23:47.363
- Emotionally Unstable.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.830
- When does it end?

23:49.830 --> 23:51.680
- It starts in the first trimester

23:51.680 --> 23:55.610
and wraps up about two
years after the baby's born.

23:55.610 --> 23:56.940
- I guess I'm here 'cause I have no idea

23:56.940 --> 23:58.410
what I'm getting into.

23:58.410 --> 24:01.230
- Oh sweetie, nobody does.

24:01.230 --> 24:04.510
- It's amazing how much
your skin stretches.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.980
- Yeah, on your stomach and your boobs.

24:06.980 --> 24:08.260
- And then your boobs shrink.

24:08.260 --> 24:12.247
However, your butt, hips,
stomach, thighs, not so much.

24:12.247 --> 24:14.120
- Oh and you're uncomfortable 24/7.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.580
- Yeah, and your bladder gets
squished flat like a pancake.

24:17.580 --> 24:19.660
- Don't forget how
they're constantly pushing

24:19.660 --> 24:21.797
in your sciatic nerve, every
time you wanna take a break.

24:21.797 --> 24:24.770
- Yeah, and this extra mass
you have to carry around,

24:24.770 --> 24:26.563
that people call baby weight.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.730
- Then there's the constant barfing.

24:29.730 --> 24:32.770
- My doctor said I should gain 30 pounds,

24:32.770 --> 24:34.520
but I can't keep a thing down.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.975
- I never had a single problem
during my first pregnancy.

24:37.975 --> 24:38.808
- Oh.

24:39.850 --> 24:41.350
- She's not the norm.

24:41.350 --> 24:45.340
- Let's not forget the unbelievable
pain during childbirth.

24:45.340 --> 24:48.340
- It's like that movie
where that alien thing

24:48.340 --> 24:51.253
rips out the guy's chest,
except it's your vagina.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.870
- During my last delivery
I thought I was gonna die

24:54.870 --> 24:56.410
on three separate occasions.

24:56.410 --> 24:59.570
- Oh, if they don't shove
an epidural into my spine

24:59.570 --> 25:01.350
the moment I walk through
that hospital door,

25:01.350 --> 25:03.310
oh somebody's gonna hear about it.

25:03.310 --> 25:07.340
- I took catatonic micro-naps
between diaper changings

25:07.340 --> 25:09.000
and bouts of weeping.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.390
- My little boy kept his
sleep and eating schedule

25:11.390 --> 25:13.400
right along with mine.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.270
- Of course he did.

25:14.270 --> 25:16.500
- Forget about having a social life ever.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.090
- Or ever finding a man.

25:18.090 --> 25:20.670
- And then, before you know it,
they're talking back to you.

25:20.670 --> 25:23.690
- The first word they
learn after mama is no.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.101
- Thumb sucking monsters.

25:25.101 --> 25:26.630
- Ungrateful brats.

25:26.630 --> 25:29.973
- Mine's an absolute angel, really.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.483
- So, we've given this a lot of thought.

25:42.483 --> 25:44.810
- And all we ask is that
you keep an open mind.

25:44.810 --> 25:48.033
- We come with all the
love that is family.

25:49.320 --> 25:50.480
- All right.

25:50.480 --> 25:54.333
- We, that is Nick and myself,

25:55.900 --> 25:58.941
we were hoping that.
(feet thumping)

25:58.941 --> 26:00.555
(children yelling)

26:00.555 --> 26:01.513
- Hey!

26:01.513 --> 26:04.533
Hey, get upstairs, before I
smack you upside your heads.

26:05.708 --> 26:06.671
Now!

26:06.671 --> 26:08.330
(children's laughter receding)

26:08.330 --> 26:09.163
Go on.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.870
- We'd like to adopt one of your kids.

26:15.587 --> 26:17.673
- Huh, I beg your pardon?

26:18.864 --> 26:20.023
- On a trial basis.

26:26.175 --> 26:27.750
- Well, you know how difficult it's been

26:27.750 --> 26:30.120
for Nick and me to conceive.

26:30.120 --> 26:35.120
And we were thinking that
maybe God sent you one

26:35.490 --> 26:36.903
of ours by accident.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.450
- Now, let's say you were
to give us one of your kids,

26:41.450 --> 26:45.420
and then decide later you
gave us the wrong one.

26:45.420 --> 26:49.140
Now we would have no problem
exchanging that child

26:49.140 --> 26:50.860
for one of equal or lessor value.

26:50.860 --> 26:51.693
- No.

26:52.550 --> 26:53.760
- Now personally, I've taken a shine

26:53.760 --> 26:54.640
to little Wendy over here.

26:54.640 --> 26:55.730
- [Brandy] No!

26:55.730 --> 26:57.780
- Now take your time to think about it.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.850
- What part of no did you miss?

26:59.850 --> 27:02.512
You can't just expect me to
give you one of my children.

27:02.512 --> 27:03.530
(footsteps thumping)
(children laughing)

27:03.530 --> 27:04.363
hey!

27:04.363 --> 27:08.124
I said go outside, I will beat
your asses black and blue!

27:08.124 --> 27:09.821
I will get the spoon.

27:09.821 --> 27:11.000
I will get the spoon.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.230
(child screaming playfully)
(door slamming)

27:14.230 --> 27:15.470
These are my babies.

27:15.470 --> 27:17.853
- Brandy, you need to understand,

27:18.750 --> 27:20.603
this is the will of Jesus.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.370
- He never said anything to me about it.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.960
- Well, it does get
pretty loud around here.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.360
It's possible you missed it.

27:31.334 --> 27:32.210
(Brandy chuckles)

27:32.210 --> 27:34.520
You really gotta listen to it.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.353
'Cause it's quiet.

27:35.353 --> 27:37.720
He's, he's a soft talker.

27:37.720 --> 27:39.163
But I heard it clear as day.

27:40.140 --> 27:41.153
- Me too.
- Yep.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.160
Right during Wheel of Fortune.

27:44.160 --> 27:47.360
And I looked to Maryanne
and said, did you hear that?

27:47.360 --> 27:48.500
That sounded like Jesus.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.300
- [Maryanne] I heard it loud and clear.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.280
- Oh.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.790
- And it wasn't Pat Sajak,
they sound similar I know,

27:53.790 --> 27:55.430
but it wasn't him.

27:55.430 --> 27:58.550
And I said, we definitely
gotta go to Brandy's house

27:58.550 --> 28:01.923
and see about getting
ourselves one of them kids.

28:03.319 --> 28:04.152
- Yep.

28:04.152 --> 28:06.170
- And that's why we're
here, on God's errand.

28:06.170 --> 28:07.660
- [Maryanne] Yep.

28:07.660 --> 28:09.020
- You're gonna look me in the face

28:09.020 --> 28:12.400
and tell me Jesus told you one of my kids

28:12.400 --> 28:13.457
belongs to you?

28:19.190 --> 28:21.523
(sad music)

28:26.492 --> 28:30.325
(echoing children's laughter)

29:37.910 --> 29:39.360
- Tyrell, you wanna stop giving our

29:39.360 --> 29:41.147
clients dental floss please?

29:48.920 --> 29:50.530
Nick.

29:50.530 --> 29:51.363
What can I do you for?

29:51.363 --> 29:54.943
Here, have some licorice.

29:56.521 --> 29:57.563
- Oh, no thank you.

30:01.275 --> 30:04.310
- No.

30:04.310 --> 30:07.470
Those are Daddy's, don't touch those.

30:07.470 --> 30:10.980
- So your business is called
whatever you need, right?

30:10.980 --> 30:15.520
I mean that's, that's
anything, that's whatever?

30:15.520 --> 30:18.750
- Nick, I'm the man to see.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.890
Whatever you want, I can get it.

30:22.256 --> 30:24.310
(candy crunching)

30:24.310 --> 30:29.030
I got this innate ability to
look deep into a man's soul

30:30.375 --> 30:32.613
and know what it is he wants.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.450
And I can get it.

30:36.550 --> 30:40.813
What you want are industrial
strength toilet lids.

30:43.018 --> 30:45.050
(Roach laughing)

30:45.050 --> 30:47.570
Oh man, I'm just yanking your cord.

30:47.570 --> 30:49.420
I'm just up to my ass in toilet lids.

30:50.450 --> 30:52.683
Anyway, what floats your dingy?

30:53.610 --> 30:56.283
- Well, what I need is um,

31:00.720 --> 31:02.890
What I would like for you to,

31:02.890 --> 31:06.793
Roach, I need you to help
me acquire a little, human.

31:11.210 --> 31:12.710
- You want a midget?

31:12.710 --> 31:16.120
- They prefer actually
to be called dwarves,

31:16.120 --> 31:17.623
or little people?

31:19.100 --> 31:20.590
- You want a little people?

31:21.780 --> 31:24.680
- I need you to adopt me a baby.

31:24.680 --> 31:28.260
- We're fresh out of babies at the moment.

31:28.260 --> 31:30.060
Was that one of my responsibilities?

31:31.186 --> 31:34.190
I mean, 'cause if, if you need a baby,

31:34.190 --> 31:36.080
Roach, if you need a baby I can go out--

31:36.080 --> 31:39.630
- Could you shut up and
let Daddy do the work?

31:39.630 --> 31:41.020
This is big people time.

31:41.020 --> 31:42.293
Go play with your guns.

31:49.699 --> 31:52.630
- It's not as bad as it seems.

31:52.630 --> 31:54.780
It'll be over and done
with pretty quickly.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.080
- That obvious, huh?

32:00.800 --> 32:02.923
- You remind me of my first time here.

32:04.886 --> 32:06.186
- You've done this before?

32:10.403 --> 32:11.293
Does it hurt?

32:12.380 --> 32:13.243
- [Nurse] Andrea?

32:14.290 --> 32:16.143
We're ready for your consultation.

32:18.000 --> 32:18.833
- Thank you.

32:21.370 --> 32:24.040
- Found the perfect candidate,
first name, pictures,

32:24.040 --> 32:25.903
and her next appointment.

32:29.090 --> 32:30.820
- Fantastic.

32:30.820 --> 32:33.243
I feel like I owe you something.

32:33.243 --> 32:34.893
That door has a lock on it.

32:39.066 --> 32:39.899
(clears throat)

32:39.899 --> 32:41.566
Here's your payment.

32:42.420 --> 32:43.253
It's got your name on it,

32:43.253 --> 32:44.963
I'm pretty sure it's all yours.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.890
- Call me when you have another job,

32:49.890 --> 32:52.333
and only if you have another job.

32:53.596 --> 32:54.429
Mm kay?

32:56.780 --> 32:59.780
- But I wore teddy grams
and diamonds for ya.

32:59.780 --> 33:00.683
It's never enough.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.643
Tyrell, get in here
and clean this shit up.

33:07.540 --> 33:09.680
- Please take hands.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.623
We're, we're gonna talk to the Lord.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.113
Dear Lord,

33:18.080 --> 33:20.296
We ask for thy blessing

33:21.721 --> 33:23.696
so that Nick and his friends

33:25.012 --> 33:28.460
can perform this uh,

33:28.786 --> 33:30.358
- Get your hands,
- Shhh!

33:30.358 --> 33:31.191
- Shh!

33:35.796 --> 33:40.796
Adopt this baby into our
eventual loving arms.

33:43.790 --> 33:44.623
Amen.

33:47.900 --> 33:48.733
Good luck.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.520
- What?
(camera clicks)

33:53.520 --> 33:55.760
- Look at my sister, taking her first

33:55.760 --> 33:57.910
vacation in what, never?

33:57.910 --> 34:00.040
- It's called a sabbatical
and I don't know when

34:00.040 --> 34:01.080
I'll be back.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.430
Could be a month or longer.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.199
- So where am I taking you?

34:09.199 --> 34:10.033
- Just downtown.

34:10.033 --> 34:12.250
I'll take the shuttle to the airport.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.530
- Why don't I just drop
you off at the airport?

34:14.530 --> 34:15.989
- Because I know how much
you don't wanna do this,

34:15.989 --> 34:18.730
and I don't wanna hear
about it the whole time.

34:18.730 --> 34:20.780
- I love taking family all over the city.

34:22.170 --> 34:23.719
Not like I have any work to do.

34:31.460 --> 34:32.790
Have fun.
- Thank you.

34:32.790 --> 34:33.623
- Be careful.

34:34.560 --> 34:37.043
- Is that my brother or
the police officer talking?

34:38.300 --> 34:39.933
- Your brother the detective.

34:41.139 --> 34:42.469
- I'll call you when I get settled.

34:42.469 --> 34:43.530
- You better.

34:43.530 --> 34:45.737
I love ya sis.

34:55.670 --> 34:57.610
(suit case wheels dragging on cement)

34:57.610 --> 34:58.443
- That's her.

35:00.914 --> 35:02.865
(Nick roars)

35:02.865 --> 35:04.659
- [Andrea] Hey! Stop, help!

35:04.659 --> 35:06.089
Get off! Get off!

35:06.089 --> 35:08.188
(Andrea screaming)

35:08.188 --> 35:09.434
- [Tyrell] I need some help.

35:09.434 --> 35:12.351
(Andrea screaming)

35:14.120 --> 35:15.545
- Hurry the hell up.

35:15.944 --> 35:17.460
(Nick moaning in pain)

35:21.884 --> 35:23.967
- [Tyrell] Get the luggage.

35:32.255 --> 35:33.755
Come on, let's go!

35:44.841 --> 35:47.886
(Andrea groaning)

35:47.886 --> 35:51.994
(music box playing "Pop goes the weasel")

35:57.985 --> 36:00.026
(Scary Music)

36:04.792 --> 36:07.078
- (Altered high-pitched
voice) Remain calm.

36:07.078 --> 36:09.486
- (Altered low-pitched voice)
Once you deliver the baby,

36:09.486 --> 36:10.969
you'll be free to go.

36:10.969 --> 36:14.260
- Deliver, what the hell
are you talking about?

36:14.260 --> 36:17.837
- After the baby's born,
you can walk out of here.

36:17.837 --> 36:20.620
- But the baby stays with us, forever.

36:21.602 --> 36:23.785
And don't even think
about trying to escape.

36:23.785 --> 36:25.310
These walls are sound proof.

36:25.310 --> 36:26.143
- Help!

36:27.142 --> 36:29.273
Help somebody, I'm in the basement!

36:29.273 --> 36:31.573
I'm locked, I'm handcuffed to the bed!

36:31.573 --> 36:32.992
Help someone please!

36:32.992 --> 36:33.825
Can you hear me?

36:33.825 --> 36:36.512
Please someone help me!

36:36.512 --> 36:38.990
- Screaming is not going to help you.

36:38.990 --> 36:40.580
- Look, I don't know what
kind of game this is,

36:40.580 --> 36:42.783
but this baby isn't coming any time soon.

36:51.393 --> 36:52.976
- [Maryanne] Honey?

36:55.373 --> 36:56.956
- Hold on a second.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.503
- Jesus Nick, where did you find her?

37:00.503 --> 37:02.910
- Roach found her.
- Where at?

37:02.910 --> 37:05.360
- A place called Choice Parenthood.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.703
- Dear Lord Nick, that's
an abortion clinic.

37:08.890 --> 37:10.720
We can't keep her here for seven months.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.460
We only have enough money for two weeks.

37:12.460 --> 37:13.470
Three tops.

37:13.470 --> 37:16.685
- You're right, it's gonna
make Christmas really awkward.

37:16.685 --> 37:17.518
- You think?

37:17.518 --> 37:19.023
- No, I'm pretty sure.

37:20.270 --> 37:23.229
- All right, (sighs)
we'll just knock her out

37:23.229 --> 37:25.100
and take her back to the clinic.

37:25.100 --> 37:25.933
- Wait, wait.

37:28.250 --> 37:33.250
If we let her go, she'll just
throw that precious life away.

37:34.060 --> 37:36.760
And we'll be accessories to murder.

37:36.760 --> 37:39.420
- So you're saying we
should save that baby.

37:39.420 --> 37:40.253
- We should.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.588
It's the right thing to do.

37:43.588 --> 37:46.076
- I love doing the right thing.

37:46.076 --> 37:48.578
We're gonna have a baby. (laughs)

37:48.578 --> 37:49.920
(electronic feedback)

37:49.920 --> 37:52.470
- What's a gestation period?

37:52.470 --> 37:55.423
- Oh, it's the amount of
time it takes to make a baby.

37:59.460 --> 38:00.543
- Sounds clinical.

38:03.770 --> 38:05.633
- Look at you getting into this.

38:07.230 --> 38:09.273
You're gonna make a very cute father.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.643
- This says she needs 13 checkups
throughout the pregnancy.

38:20.780 --> 38:21.793
Seems like overkill.

38:24.620 --> 38:25.993
- How many has she had?

38:27.544 --> 38:28.794
- I don't know.

38:29.580 --> 38:31.760
- Hey, I have to pee.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.527
- How many doctor checkups have you had?

38:34.527 --> 38:37.013
- Oh, um, none.

38:37.022 --> 38:39.460
Because when you don't intend to keep it

38:39.460 --> 38:41.510
you don't see a doctor.

38:45.735 --> 38:47.538
(washing machine buzzing)

38:49.371 --> 38:50.204
- Nick.

38:52.230 --> 38:54.263
- You wanna wear those to bed tonight?

38:55.381 --> 38:56.540
- We've got a problem.

38:56.540 --> 38:58.143
- I was just looking at it.

38:59.019 --> 39:01.040
- We have a problem.

39:01.040 --> 39:01.873
- With?

39:04.280 --> 39:06.670
Oh, oh, in the basement, yes.

39:06.670 --> 39:08.170
We have a prisoner down there.

39:11.370 --> 39:13.523
Picking up ultrasound machine for repair.

39:19.060 --> 39:19.893
Thanks.

39:34.430 --> 39:37.413
We'll have it back to you
by the end of the week.

39:49.690 --> 39:53.830
- Hey Andrea, it's been three days

39:53.830 --> 39:55.853
and well, you promised you'd call.

39:57.290 --> 40:00.023
I hope that means you're
having the time of your life.

40:01.060 --> 40:05.293
So, give me a call when
you get this, okay?

40:11.579 --> 40:14.410
- I need to change the sheets.

40:14.410 --> 40:16.343
- You're going to jail.

40:16.343 --> 40:17.176
You know that?

40:18.440 --> 40:20.060
My brother's a police
detective and I'm sure

40:20.060 --> 40:22.403
he has the entire force
out looking for me.

40:23.382 --> 40:24.215
- Okay.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.780
I still need to change the sheets.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.840
- Look, I'll have him go easy on you.

40:30.840 --> 40:32.940
- Why? So you can murder that little baby?

40:34.720 --> 40:36.403
- That is my choice.

40:37.610 --> 40:39.460
- Do you have any concept of how precious

40:39.460 --> 40:40.950
a human life is?

40:40.950 --> 40:42.380
- Hah!

40:42.380 --> 40:46.370
Do you have any concept of
how many laws you've broken?

40:46.370 --> 40:47.560
Of what you've taken away from me

40:47.560 --> 40:49.260
by keeping me here like an animal?

40:50.387 --> 40:53.257
- Yeah, well, you left us no choice.

40:55.632 --> 40:59.001
(Andrea screams)

40:59.001 --> 41:00.920
(lock clicking)

41:00.920 --> 41:03.200
- I really don't have time for your games.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.810
I stop playing them when I stopped dating.

41:05.810 --> 41:10.492
No,no,no,no,no, I would show
me more respect, if I were you.

41:10.492 --> 41:11.684
What's up?

41:11.684 --> 41:12.517
- I need you to check and see

41:12.517 --> 41:14.500
if somebody made it on a plane.

41:14.840 --> 41:18.270
- No no no no, that is not a
confidential informant's job.

41:18.270 --> 41:19.103
Okay?

41:19.103 --> 41:21.140
You have to get the information
that I'm asking for,

41:21.140 --> 41:24.800
and the department is not going
to cover you playing bingo.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.560
Look, I have to get back to work.

41:27.560 --> 41:28.643
I love you too Mom.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.410
Crazy woman.

41:31.410 --> 41:33.260
- She's still trying to work it, huh?

41:35.025 --> 41:36.727
- Is this a missing person's case?

41:36.727 --> 41:38.727
- It's looking that way.

41:40.450 --> 41:41.900
- It's your sister, isn't it?

41:42.354 --> 41:44.755
Pathetic. I can't keep doing this, man.

41:44.763 --> 41:46.883
But did you check with her office?

41:46.883 --> 41:48.000
Huh huh huh huh?

41:48.000 --> 41:51.113
That is where she was the
last time she went missing.

41:54.470 --> 41:56.650
- Nazir, just check on the plane, okay?

41:56.650 --> 41:57.772
- So now that we have this thing,

41:57.772 --> 42:00.522
we can just start doing the
checkups on our own, right?

42:02.191 --> 42:04.391
- I think you need to
be a doctor to use it.

42:05.580 --> 42:07.140
- I don't think so, it
seems pretty simple,

42:07.140 --> 42:09.480
I mean you just stick this inside the...

42:09.480 --> 42:11.233
oh, it goes on the top, oh.

42:12.170 --> 42:14.400
- [Maryanne] Yeah, right on the belly.

42:14.400 --> 42:17.033
- Okay, all right, I see.

42:17.033 --> 42:18.960
Get a little bit of this stuff on there.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.305
Woo, oh that's cold.

42:20.305 --> 42:21.403
Here, warm that up.

42:23.475 --> 42:25.509
(machine beeping)

42:25.509 --> 42:28.589
It's like looking through
the fabric of time.

42:28.589 --> 42:31.260
(machine beeping)

42:31.260 --> 42:33.760
Okay, does that look
like a burrito to you?

42:33.760 --> 42:34.950
That's what I had for lunch.
(machine beeping)

42:34.950 --> 42:36.323
Like right there.

42:38.206 --> 42:39.039
(machine beeping)

42:39.039 --> 42:40.660
It would be chewed up a little bit.

42:40.660 --> 42:42.090
But it had beans and rice in it

42:42.090 --> 42:44.460
and I think that that's
what's in that corner there.

42:44.460 --> 42:47.200
- What if something is
wrong with the baby?

42:47.200 --> 42:49.750
- Yeah, I would not be able
to tell, that's for sure.

42:49.750 --> 42:52.776
I feel like I'm watching TV in the 1940s.

42:53.570 --> 42:55.900
- How are we gonna find a doctor?

42:55.900 --> 42:58.253
- I know a guy, bovine doctor.

42:59.160 --> 43:00.340
Best job in the world.

43:00.340 --> 43:02.123
Looks at boobs all day long.

43:03.130 --> 43:05.853
- Bovine is a cow, honey.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.373
- Not nearly as impressive.

43:11.810 --> 43:13.230
Are you sure it's not bovines?

43:13.230 --> 43:14.683
- [Maryanne] Nick, focus.

43:16.060 --> 43:17.173
- Okay a doctor.

43:18.601 --> 43:19.434
Doctor.

43:20.650 --> 43:22.910
Jasmine, my cousin
Jasmine, she says doctors

43:22.910 --> 43:25.100
come in to where she works all the time.

43:25.100 --> 43:27.460
- That makes sense, you can
just walk to the hospital

43:27.460 --> 43:28.840
from where she dances.

43:28.840 --> 43:29.755
- I know it, I've always wanted to see

43:29.755 --> 43:30.780
what it's like in there.

43:30.780 --> 43:31.970
- Whoa.

43:31.970 --> 43:33.570
- Well, how else are we
gonna get the doctor?

43:33.570 --> 43:34.880
I'm gonna have to go in there.

43:34.880 --> 43:37.763
I mean, I won't like it, that's for sure.

(telephone ringing)

44:53.330 --> 44:54.450
- This is Tom.

44:54.450 --> 44:57.030
- [Nazir On Phone] Hey, she
never made it on a plane.

44:57.030 --> 44:59.083
She wasn't even on the flight manifest.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.963
- Thanks Nazir, I owe you one.

45:10.910 --> 45:13.245
(doctor snorting)
- Wake up!

45:13.245 --> 45:14.515
- Where am I?

45:14.515 --> 45:16.170
- [Nick] That's none of your concern.

45:16.170 --> 45:19.580
Give this woman here a pregnancy exam.

45:19.580 --> 45:20.630
- Who are you people?

45:21.950 --> 45:24.560
- This is all a dream.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.225
- I told you to get this done.

45:26.225 --> 45:27.990
Go get this done.

45:27.990 --> 45:29.730
- Mm, Dr. Wilson.

45:29.730 --> 45:31.080
When did you come on shift?

45:32.060 --> 45:34.171
- Just do what you're told.

45:34.171 --> 45:35.333
- Okey-dokey.

45:38.994 --> 45:41.590
(machine beeping)

45:41.590 --> 45:43.533
Stay very still masked woman.

45:48.382 --> 45:50.900
(machine beeping)

45:50.900 --> 45:52.475
And...

45:52.491 --> 45:53.499
(fetal heartbeat thumping)

45:53.507 --> 45:54.881
There.

45:54.881 --> 45:56.660
- [Nick] You can tell what that is?

45:56.660 --> 45:57.830
- It's human.

45:57.830 --> 45:59.460
- Yes.

45:59.460 --> 46:01.420
- And at this stage in the pregnancy,

46:01.420 --> 46:04.720
everything looks okey-dokey.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.537
- Thank you doctor.

46:07.020 --> 46:09.550
- Are you sure this is a dream Dr. Wilson?

46:09.550 --> 46:12.560
- Yes, it's a dream, a beautiful dream.

46:12.560 --> 46:15.135
And you're asleep inside
your car at the strip club.

46:15.135 --> 46:16.968
(wood thunking)

46:16.968 --> 46:19.885
(Andrea squeaking)

46:23.052 --> 46:23.885
- Nick!

46:25.320 --> 46:26.777
Roach wants to see you.

46:28.380 --> 46:29.410
- Why?

46:29.410 --> 46:31.833
- I don't know, get in the van.

46:35.880 --> 46:40.880
- You want me to get
into that big green van?

46:40.994 --> 46:43.327
- Yeah, just get in the van.

46:51.500 --> 46:54.583
- I'm gravely disappointed in you Nick.

46:55.520 --> 46:56.393
- Gravely?

46:57.400 --> 46:58.383
Really? Why?

47:00.910 --> 47:03.930
- Not only do I run a successful business,

47:03.930 --> 47:05.870
but an entrepreneurship.

47:05.870 --> 47:06.970
It's the American way.

47:07.837 --> 47:09.852
- Yeah, but none of
these guys are American.

47:09.852 --> 47:10.820
(fingers snapping)

47:11.470 --> 47:16.470
- Nick, me getting you
the baby makes us square.

47:17.360 --> 47:19.920
But when an ultrasound
machine walks out the door

47:19.920 --> 47:21.790
people start pointing fingers.

47:21.790 --> 47:24.973
Fingers pointed at one of my
guys in that doctor's office.

47:26.870 --> 47:30.950
- Oh, sorry, I mean,
I'm gonna take it back

47:30.950 --> 47:32.230
when we're done.

47:32.230 --> 47:33.073
- You're sorry.

47:36.950 --> 47:39.900
You come to me asking for help.

47:39.900 --> 47:42.528
I provide the means for
you to accomplish it.

47:48.043 --> 47:49.960
We're gonna have to figure out a way

47:49.960 --> 47:51.733
for you to compensate me, Nick.

47:53.130 --> 47:55.273
Do we have an understanding between us?

47:56.140 --> 47:57.498
- Scout's honor.

47:59.870 --> 48:00.703
- Good.

48:01.570 --> 48:04.170
Get the hell out of here,
I have another meeting.

48:04.170 --> 48:06.030
- Okay, thanks.

48:12.980 --> 48:16.283
- Hold on, so you're
telling me Andrea's missing?

48:16.985 --> 48:19.020
- I'm saying she never boarded her plane

48:19.020 --> 48:20.770
and she isn't returning her calls.

48:20.770 --> 48:22.400
- And?

48:22.400 --> 48:24.090
- [Tom] Well it's not like her.

48:24.090 --> 48:25.720
- Yes it is, actually.

48:25.720 --> 48:26.770
- But this feels different.

48:26.770 --> 48:28.550
I mean my gut's telling
me she's in trouble.

48:28.550 --> 48:31.130
- Okay, you wanna hear my
take on this situation?

48:31.130 --> 48:31.980
- [Tom] Yes please.

48:31.980 --> 48:34.290
- When Andrea came to us and announced

48:34.290 --> 48:35.940
that she was gonna take a leave of absence

48:35.940 --> 48:37.750
I think we all knew that she would be gone

48:37.750 --> 48:41.856
for seven to eight months at least.

48:41.856 --> 48:43.820
- Seven to eight months, why so long?

48:43.820 --> 48:45.537
- So the baby could be born.

48:48.220 --> 48:49.545
- Andrea's pregnant?

48:50.820 --> 48:53.501
- Hmm, guess you didn't know that.

48:56.488 --> 48:59.571
(door lock clicking)

49:01.440 --> 49:02.820
- [Maryanne] Here's your lunch.

49:02.820 --> 49:03.653
- Thank you.

49:04.567 --> 49:06.930
- I checked the newspaper and the internet

49:06.930 --> 49:11.640
and there wasn't any
mention of your missing.

49:11.640 --> 49:13.023
[Maryanne] Maybe your brother's not

49:13.023 --> 49:14.431
looking for you after all.

49:14.460 --> 49:17.597
- Or maybe he is and the press
just doesn't know it yet.

49:17.597 --> 49:19.180
- I guess we'll see.

49:19.180 --> 49:22.920
- So let's say I stay here, long term.

49:22.920 --> 49:24.469
What do I do about clothes?

49:24.469 --> 49:25.302
- Clothes?

49:25.302 --> 49:26.990
- I'll be too big for what I have.

49:30.030 --> 49:33.560
- I have to admit, I was a
little surprised you dropped by

49:33.560 --> 49:37.763
after uh, what happened on our last visit.

49:42.300 --> 49:45.610
- I um, I want to apologize.

49:45.993 --> 49:50.993
Nick and I weren't in a very
good state of mind that day.

49:52.260 --> 49:53.763
- What's past is past.

49:56.060 --> 49:58.113
- I have a favor to ask.

49:59.660 --> 50:01.890
- You haven't been talking
to our lord and savior

50:01.890 --> 50:04.083
Pat Sajak again, have you?

50:05.530 --> 50:07.800
- No, I uh,

50:07.800 --> 50:08.780
I was wondering if I could

50:08.780 --> 50:10.323
borrow some maternity clothes.

50:12.722 --> 50:14.062
- You are?

50:14.062 --> 50:15.147
Woo!

50:15.147 --> 50:18.637
Oh! I'm so happy for you and Nick!

50:18.637 --> 50:21.466
Muzzle top! (laughs)

50:21.466 --> 50:23.248
That's so exciting!

50:23.248 --> 50:24.680
You've, you've got that look.

50:24.680 --> 50:27.490
Your boobs are bigger today. (laughs)

50:27.490 --> 50:28.323
How you feeling?

50:28.323 --> 50:29.550
You sick? You puking a lot?

50:29.550 --> 50:30.383
You puking a lot?

50:30.383 --> 50:32.950
For me, brushing teeth,
bananas, (imitates vomiting).

50:34.210 --> 50:35.043
When are you due?

50:35.043 --> 50:36.760
I hope it's a girl, do
you think it'll be a girl?

50:36.760 --> 50:37.950
Are you carrying low?

50:37.950 --> 50:39.050
You eating a lot of beef?

50:39.050 --> 50:40.720
I ate a lot of beef with my girls.

50:40.720 --> 50:43.380
You better pray to Jesus for a C section

50:43.380 --> 50:47.263
'cause those vaginal births
are a pain in the well,

50:57.706 --> 50:58.539
- What?

51:00.033 --> 51:03.520
- Nothing just uh, you
didn't wear your mask

51:03.520 --> 51:04.870
and your voice changey thingy.

51:04.870 --> 51:06.173
- Oh crap!

51:14.360 --> 51:18.903
Well, this is the real me.

51:21.090 --> 51:21.923
Ta-da.

51:25.810 --> 51:26.740
- I like it.

51:26.740 --> 51:28.240
The real you is nice.

51:28.240 --> 51:30.180
What's this?

51:30.180 --> 51:31.053
- Clothes.

51:32.360 --> 51:34.010
For when yours don't fit anymore.

51:36.819 --> 51:38.744
- (sighs) Great.

51:38.744 --> 51:39.577
Uh...

51:43.477 --> 51:45.952
Do you have anything else?

51:46.550 --> 51:48.370
(Nick groaning)
- Come on.

51:48.370 --> 51:50.850
- I don't know why I have to show my face,

51:50.850 --> 51:53.323
just because you forgot
to put your mask on?

51:54.550 --> 51:56.030
- I want her to trust us.

51:56.030 --> 51:57.980
- I know but what if she recognizes me?

51:59.010 --> 52:00.610
- What is she gonna
recognize you from Nick?

52:00.610 --> 52:02.500
- I've got a very recognizable face.

52:02.500 --> 52:05.730
And, I was a pro wrestling
referee for like two years.

52:05.730 --> 52:07.531
I was on TV.

52:08.380 --> 52:11.963
That's what my trophy's
for, the one in the bedroom.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.665
- You're doing this.

52:15.665 --> 52:19.332
(Nick grunting and sighing)

52:24.030 --> 52:26.530
[Maryanne] I'd like you
to meet my husband Nick.

52:27.480 --> 52:28.313
- Hi.

52:29.230 --> 52:31.505
I'm your friendly neighborhood kidnapper.

52:32.900 --> 52:33.850
- Nice to meet you.

52:35.380 --> 52:38.543
- All right well, see ya.

52:49.940 --> 52:51.233
Thanks guys.

52:53.870 --> 52:54.703
Hello.

52:55.800 --> 52:59.723
Hi, hey, hey, wake up.

53:01.050 --> 53:01.883
Hi.

53:03.962 --> 53:06.795
(doctor grunting)

53:08.120 --> 53:09.740
- Where am I?

53:09.740 --> 53:10.900
Who are you people?

53:10.900 --> 53:12.730
- Hush, hush, hush, it's okay, it's okay.

53:12.730 --> 53:16.630
Look you're safe, but
this woman over here,

53:16.630 --> 53:19.387
she needs a pregnancy
exam in the worst way.

53:21.580 --> 53:22.413
- Jasmine?

53:24.660 --> 53:27.163
- No, just give her an exam.

53:27.163 --> 53:28.693
This isn't a request.

53:29.612 --> 53:32.445
(doctor grunting)

53:34.320 --> 53:35.153
- Oh...

53:37.478 --> 53:39.303
I can't do that.

53:39.693 --> 53:43.325
- No you can, you can,
you can make it, ya know?

53:43.325 --> 53:45.992
- I'm not that kind of a doctor.

53:47.200 --> 53:51.170
- Oh, what kind of a doctor are you?

53:51.170 --> 53:53.144
- You realize they kidnapped me, right?

53:53.144 --> 53:55.103
- What a small world, me too.

53:56.090 --> 53:59.330
Um, I don't have any tools.

53:59.330 --> 54:01.410
Do you have a Popsicle stick?

54:01.410 --> 54:03.160
- [Nick] Here you go.

54:03.160 --> 54:06.863
- Oh, thank you.
- Really? You just had that?

54:06.863 --> 54:09.090
- [Doctor] Open wide, lemme see here.

54:10.990 --> 54:13.860
Those are teeth.

54:13.860 --> 54:15.370
All, all these,

54:15.370 --> 54:16.203
- [Nick] Yes?

54:16.203 --> 54:17.230
- These they have to come out.

54:17.230 --> 54:18.256
- All of 'em?
- I think so.

54:18.256 --> 54:20.253
- [Nick] Okay.

54:20.253 --> 54:21.972
- Are you--
- Do you have pliers?

54:21.972 --> 54:23.123
- [Nick] I, I have vice grips.

54:23.123 --> 54:24.000
- [Doctor] A vice grip?

54:24.000 --> 54:25.370
- [Andrea] Fresh out of vice grips.

54:25.370 --> 54:26.203
- [Nick] Maybe I can get,

54:26.203 --> 54:27.700
(baton thunking)
[Nick] Aw!

54:27.700 --> 54:30.710
(doctor grunting)

54:30.710 --> 54:32.270
- A dentist Nick, really?

54:32.270 --> 54:34.000
- I don't know I was supposed to know.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.430
- Well, you were supposed to make sure

54:35.430 --> 54:38.760
he is who he says he is,
before you kidnap him.

54:38.760 --> 54:40.620
- Right well, Jasmine just called

54:40.620 --> 54:43.092
and said that she had another doctor.

54:43.092 --> 54:45.070
I just picked him up, that's not my fault.

54:45.070 --> 54:47.490
- Well, what are we supposed to do now?

54:47.490 --> 54:50.540
- [Nick] Maybe Dr. Fendo
is at the club tonight?

54:50.540 --> 54:53.026
- Nick, she's already three weeks past due

54:53.026 --> 54:54.638
her last check up.

54:54.970 --> 54:58.580
- Okay then we'll just drug her up

54:58.580 --> 54:59.980
and take her to Dr. Evans

54:59.980 --> 55:01.880
and say she's your handicapped cousin.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.238
- No.

55:04.238 --> 55:06.230
- (sighs) Then you come up with something.

55:06.230 --> 55:08.630
I'm tired of being the
brains of this operation.

55:09.490 --> 55:12.340
- Nick, I don't know if I can
get through this next year.

55:14.340 --> 55:16.505
- You wanna give up?

55:18.915 --> 55:20.165
- I don't know.

55:22.960 --> 55:27.113
- Look, we've already come this far.

55:31.390 --> 55:32.223
And...

55:33.400 --> 55:36.840
With my criminal record,
I mean, there's a lot more

55:36.840 --> 55:39.383
at stake than just a baby.

55:41.600 --> 55:42.500
- All right, yeah.

55:45.150 --> 55:46.350
We can get through this.

55:48.140 --> 55:49.323
- We can, we can.

55:54.070 --> 55:55.320
- A tip just called.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.470
It could break the
Martinez case wide open.

56:01.250 --> 56:03.170
Oh, and they just announced you

56:03.170 --> 56:05.720
are the new Captain of Detectives!

56:05.720 --> 56:09.540
I have got two prostitutes
from the red light district

56:09.540 --> 56:11.390
waiting outside to celebrate with us.

56:15.370 --> 56:17.120
- How many abortion clinics
do you think there are

56:17.120 --> 56:18.310
in this city?

56:18.310 --> 56:21.070
- Oh, come on man, you can't keep this up.

56:21.070 --> 56:23.641
- My sister getting pregnant
was the lead we needed.

56:23.641 --> 56:27.040
- Okay, okay.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.320
20 bucks.

56:28.320 --> 56:31.490
20 bucks says that she
is sitting on a beach

56:31.490 --> 56:33.070
somewhere in the Bahamas.

56:33.070 --> 56:37.445
She is sipping a virgin margarita...

56:37.503 --> 56:39.069
On the rocks.

56:39.473 --> 56:42.013
And she's thinking to herself, oh, oh,

56:42.013 --> 56:44.030
I should probably call Tom.

56:44.980 --> 56:46.870
- There's no paper trail.

56:46.870 --> 56:48.980
No credit card activity.

56:48.980 --> 56:50.840
It's like she vanished into thin air.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.290
- That's because she's
paying for it with cash.

56:53.290 --> 56:54.490
- You don't know Andrea.

56:55.365 --> 56:57.140
I mean, she's too driven
and work psychotic

56:57.140 --> 57:00.210
to let an unplanned
pregnancy inconvenience her.

57:00.210 --> 57:01.751
- Okay, okay, I don't know, I don't know.

57:01.751 --> 57:03.760
But what I do know is that
you are too close to this

57:03.760 --> 57:05.540
to look at it objectively.

57:05.540 --> 57:09.210
- Do me one more favor, check
out these abortion clinics.

57:09.210 --> 57:12.110
- If this is another dead end
promise me you'll drop this

57:12.110 --> 57:14.690
and start working our other cases.

57:14.690 --> 57:15.523
- Trust me.

57:16.930 --> 57:18.690
- [Man On TV] I can't.

57:18.690 --> 57:19.814
There's so many.

57:19.814 --> 57:21.231
(loud hissing)
- Oh!

57:21.231 --> 57:22.522
- [Man On TV] The monsters!

57:22.522 --> 57:24.023
[Nick] I'm home!

57:24.290 --> 57:25.944
Back from fending off evil.

57:25.944 --> 57:27.120
- Shhh
- The world is safe

57:27.120 --> 57:28.443
another day.
- Shhh.

57:29.338 --> 57:30.863
- [Nick] What are you guys watching?

57:31.920 --> 57:33.170
- Dinner's in the fridge.

57:35.300 --> 57:36.600
- Do I have to heat it up?

57:41.790 --> 57:42.623
- What?

57:43.571 --> 57:46.693
- Nothing. By the way, she dies.

57:52.849 --> 57:55.570
(monster roaring)
(women screaming)

57:55.570 --> 57:58.478
- Oh gosh, I didn't see that coming.

57:58.478 --> 57:59.886
Soup's on.

57:59.886 --> 58:01.340
- [Andrea] Hey come here.

58:01.340 --> 58:02.382
- What's wrong?

58:02.382 --> 58:04.333
- Nothing, nothing, just feel it.

58:11.771 --> 58:13.720
(both women gasp)

58:13.720 --> 58:15.040
- Feel that?

58:15.040 --> 58:16.073
- I felt it kick.

58:17.410 --> 58:19.233
- [Andrea] She's been really active today.

58:20.110 --> 58:20.943
- She?

58:22.820 --> 58:26.496
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a her.

58:38.390 --> 58:41.033
- [Maryanne] Hey, rise and shine.

58:46.274 --> 58:47.233
- What's this?

58:48.410 --> 58:53.410
- Well, every pregnancy
needs a baby shower. (laughs)

59:00.740 --> 59:03.895
- Cute! Thank you.

59:04.540 --> 59:06.040
Nick, did you make this?

59:06.040 --> 59:07.670
- [Nick] You betcha.

59:07.670 --> 59:08.523
- And this one.

59:10.687 --> 59:12.437
- Oh that is darling.

59:13.800 --> 59:14.633
I love it.

59:15.730 --> 59:17.040
She look good?

59:17.040 --> 59:18.902
Nick, what do you think?

59:18.902 --> 59:20.415
- Uh huh.

59:20.415 --> 59:21.960
- Oh Nick, she looks so cute.

59:21.960 --> 59:24.140
- It's perfect, she loves it.

59:24.140 --> 59:26.300
- She says, thank you mommy.

59:26.300 --> 59:28.353
- And then one Nick chose.

59:29.222 --> 59:31.305
- Yeah, it's uh, a horse.

59:36.483 --> 59:39.040
- It is a lovely horse.

59:39.040 --> 59:40.450
Thank you Nick.

59:40.450 --> 59:41.590
- It's more of pony, really, huh?

59:41.590 --> 59:43.347
- Yeah, yeah definitely a pony.

59:44.913 --> 59:47.363
- [Maryanne] Cute little
saddle and bridle on it.

59:49.598 --> 59:50.900
(Nick sighing)

59:50.900 --> 59:55.480
- [Maryanne] Hey Superman,
something on your mind?

59:55.480 --> 59:58.423
- Yeah, where's the money
coming from for all this stuff?

59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.060
- I got another credit card.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.590
- Maryanne, we're already
up to our eyebrows in debt.

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:06.023
And we got another four months of this.

01:00:06.023 --> 01:00:08.270
- I know, I know, but I just
wanna keep her comfortable

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:13.270
and why spare any expense
on our baby, you know?

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.373
You better get going.

01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:19.250
You're gonna be late for work.

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:21.527
- Yeah, right.

01:00:25.905 --> 01:00:28.791
(door opening and closing)

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:29.850
(Maryanne sighing)

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:30.830
- Tom come here.

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:34.065
You my friend, are going
to want to see this.

01:00:34.065 --> 01:00:35.315
- What are we looking at?

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:38.570
- I got the security
camera footage from a few

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:40.660
of the abortion clinics up town.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.460
It's around the same time
your sister missed her flight.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.093
Right there.

01:00:51.123 --> 01:00:53.990
- I want a make on that van.

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:56.140
And a list of everyone who owns one.

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:56.973
- Everyone?

01:00:58.372 --> 01:00:59.910
- Localize the search.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:01.980
- Tom, that's still going
to be in the thousands.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:06.373
- Nazir, that's my sister.

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:10.740
- All right, I'm on it.

01:01:13.714 --> 01:01:16.481
(fist pounding)

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.378
- [Maryanne] Hey.

01:01:20.378 --> 01:01:21.820
- [Andrea] Hey.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.640
- I'm glad you came up.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.013
- Yeah, you left the door unlocked.

01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:28.373
- You look really good.

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:30.570
- Really?

01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:32.470
Because I kinda feel like
a soccer mom just threw up

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:33.838
all over me, so...

01:01:33.838 --> 01:01:35.913
- (laughs) No, you um,

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:40.713
you look like a regular
every day expectant mother.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:43.763
You kinda have a glow.

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:46.640
- Thanks.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.840
- Are you hungry?

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.690
- Starving, yes.

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:52.407
- Well, breakfast is served.

01:01:52.407 --> 01:01:54.373
- (sighs) This is nice.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.480
- Yes, it is.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.540
- I can't even remember the last time

01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.773
I just enjoyed the sun.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:05.508
- Look, I'm sorry...

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.030
I'm sorry that we're keeping you prisoner.

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:15.783
- Andrea.

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:17.763
- Say what?

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:20.573
- My name is Andrea.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.790
You don't have to be sorry.

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:24.623
- I don't?

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:27.523
- Nope.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:36.280
- Well, Andrea, would you
like a chocolate truffle?

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.693
- Yes! Oh!

01:02:43.899 --> 01:02:44.732
Mm.

01:02:50.347 --> 01:02:52.353
You know what would make
this moment perfect?

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:54.173
- What?

01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:59.893
- Can't be too careful.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.593
- I suppose not.

01:03:06.661 --> 01:03:09.593
(ladies breathing rhythmically)

01:03:09.593 --> 01:03:11.893
- Feel free a little
bit, a little bit harder.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:14.183
Oh!
- Yeah?

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.480
How's that? Right there?

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.377
- Mm hmm, mm hmm.

01:03:18.377 --> 01:03:22.377
(ladies breathing rhythmically)

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:25.814
(Maryanne groans)

01:03:25.814 --> 01:03:27.595
- [Maryanne] Yeah.

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:29.390
- That good?
- Mm hmm.

01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:31.107
- Right there?
- Mm hmm.

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:35.960
(breathing rhythmically)
Nick, where ya going?

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.793
- Away.

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:41.433
Sugar Daddy's home.

01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:45.076
Oh, you made me a steak!

01:03:45.076 --> 01:03:47.910
Oh I'm so--
- Oh this isn't for you.

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:48.743
- What?

01:03:50.653 --> 01:03:52.270
What am I gonna eat?

01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:54.720
- [Maryanne] Macaroni and
cheese is on the stove.

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:04.950
- Can I at least get hotdogs cut up in it?

01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:06.133
- [Maryanne] Of course!

01:04:08.757 --> 01:04:10.505
- Can you cook them?

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:15.003
They're better when they're
from the stove. (groans)

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:22.480
- Oh yeah!

01:04:24.733 --> 01:04:26.747
Oh I've been needing this so bad!

01:04:28.255 --> 01:04:30.763
(moans) just a little bit down.

01:04:34.754 --> 01:04:38.587
Yeah, yeah, (laughs) oh yeah.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.697
Why didn't I get kidnapped sooner?

01:05:02.386 --> 01:05:05.219
(toilet flushing)

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.410
- I'm sorry about being
upset about dinner.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.697
You wanna make up?

01:05:17.697 --> 01:05:19.833
- I've decided to let Andrea go.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.070
- Who?

01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:25.373
- Andrea, our prisoner.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:27.713
My friend.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.518
- Is that her name?

01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:32.590
- We can't keep her anymore,

01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.673
and we can't keep her child.

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:38.240
- Well, I wish Jesus would
make up his god damn mind.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.330
- Nick, grow up.

01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:40.800
We can't do this.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.633
- Me grow up?

01:05:41.633 --> 01:05:44.060
You're the one that just
said not so long ago

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:44.960
that we should stay--

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.013
- I know, I know what I said.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.998
I was wrong.

01:05:56.836 --> 01:05:57.836
- All right.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.520
I think I know what's happening here.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.030
You're just getting cold feet.

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:04.523
- I'm not getting cold feet.

01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:07.660
- It's normal for a new mother to

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:09.860
you know, get a little bit nervous as

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:11.610
that blessed day draws near.

01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:13.750
- It's not drawing near
and I'm not nervous.

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:16.120
We just have to let her go free.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.910
- And then she goes and
tells her brother the cop

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:18.743
and I get arrested

01:06:18.743 --> 01:06:19.576
and I go back to jail.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:20.409
Is that what you want?

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:22.320
- No, that's not what I want.

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:25.420
- Do me a favor, I mean
really think about this.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.180
Take a couple weeks or couple months.

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.420
- Three days.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.410
- 10 days.

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:32.243
- Three days.

01:06:32.243 --> 01:06:33.520
- Five days?

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.620
- Three days.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.463
- A fortnight?

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:37.813
- One day.

01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:40.143
- Three days.

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.810
I'm glad we got that settled.

01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:50.227
- Yes, can I please speak
to a Julian Van Dyke please?

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:53.770
- Mr. Van Dyke isn't in at the moment.

01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:55.500
Is there anything I can help you with?

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.650
- Yes, I'm with Metro
Police and I'm inquiring

01:06:57.650 --> 01:07:00.470
about a van that Mr. Van Dyke owns.

01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:01.603
- Roach, that is.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.516
Mr. Van Dyke does not have

01:07:04.516 --> 01:07:06.499
the possession of the van anymore.

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.500
- Could you tell me how
I can get a hold of him?

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.620
- He doesn't have a specific address,

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.340
so I'm gonna have him call you back.

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.533
- Thank you very much.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:16.833
Roach.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.300
Hello Mr. Van Dyke.

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.483
You've been busy.

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:32.823
- [Nazir] You got something?

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:35.963
- Yeah.

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:39.930
Road trip.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:41.606
- Any messages?

01:07:41.606 --> 01:07:42.870
(cartridge clattering)
- Bollocks.

01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:44.580
- Uh, what was that?

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.910
- Did anyone call on the telephone,

01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:48.200
while I wasn't here?

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.830
- Nope, no messages.

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:53.011
Been quiet as a church around here.

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:54.860
- Something wrong?

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:57.430
- Geez, why would something be wrong?

01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:59.963
- I don't know, you're acting all weird.

01:07:59.963 --> 01:08:02.180
- Nothing weird here.

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.000
- Okay, don't talk back to me.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
- Quit fiddle-fucking with your gun

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.700
and get out of my seat.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.350
- Are you sure this is the place?

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:14.840
- This is the address that
Roach, Mr. Van Dyke gave

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.990
when he was questioned
by robbery-homicide.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.535
What have we got here?

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:38.893
Bingo.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.560
- Oh thank god, did you get food?

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.693
What is that?

01:08:45.029 --> 01:08:47.529
- It's sushi from the filler station.

01:08:47.529 --> 01:08:49.040
Andrea wanted me to try some,

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.250
so I figured why not?

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.274
- Did you at least get me a hot dog?

01:08:52.292 --> 01:08:55.990
- Um, it's expensive to keep
a pregnant woman around.

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:57.390
- Yeah, don't I know it!

01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:58.700
- [Maryanne] She has needs.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.752
- What about your husband's needs?

01:09:00.752 --> 01:09:03.729
Why don't we get some food in this place?

01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:07.185
God, like half the fridge is batteries.

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:09.109
(knocking on door)

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:11.251
Can you get the door?

01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:16.880
No, nevermind, let me just get it.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.810
Why don't you just hang
out with your bestie?

01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:20.720
Yes?

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.560
- Sir, I'm Detective Bowers,
this is Detective Cooler.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.540
- [Nazir] Kular.

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.100
- Like to ask you a couple
questions about your van.

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:27.933
- What van?

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.729
- The van parked in the driveway.

01:09:30.729 --> 01:09:31.630
- Oh that van.

01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:33.890
- Can you account for the
location of your vehicle

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:35.779
between the hours of noon and four p.m.

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:37.173
on the 13th of July?

01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:39.330
- 13th.

01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:40.229
- It was a Monday.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.390
- Uh, it was here, yeah, with me.

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:45.540
- You're positive about that.

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.050
- So if we were to ask your wife,

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:49.130
would she corroborate your story?

01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:49.962
- My vife?

01:09:49.962 --> 01:09:51.330
- Yes, your wife, the
woman that just walked into

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:52.630
the premises a minute ago.

01:09:53.618 --> 01:09:54.990
- Uh huh.

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:58.140
- Sir, are you sure your van
wasn't on Fourth and Hamilton?

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:00.340
- Why would my van be
at an abortion clinic?

01:10:02.993 --> 01:10:05.563
- We never said anything
about an abortion clinic.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.603
- Yes you did, yeah, you did.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.433
- Sir are you lying to us?

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:16.693
'Cause if you're lying, well,
it'll get pretty hard for ya.

01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:20.350
- You know, we were there.

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:21.860
- We?

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:23.660
- My vife and I, we were there.

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.053
But not for an abortion, for probortion.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.930
- You were protesting?

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:30.538
- Mm hmm, yep.

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:36.110
- There were no organized
protests that day.

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:38.250
- Yeah, it wasn't organized,
it's just the two of us,

01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:41.660
like a date night, just some small signs.

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.030
- So just the two of you, huh?

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:47.150
- See my wife and I, we are Christians

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:49.880
and we don't believe in abortion

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:56.020
and so we rain hellfire and
brimstone down on sinners.

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:56.853
It's our duty.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.543
- Something wrong with your face?

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.930
- Why would you say that? (laughs)

01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:05.430
- May we talk to your wife?

01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:06.280
- No.
- Why not?

01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:08.783
- It'd only take a minute.

01:11:08.783 --> 01:11:11.733
- Well she's super busy.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:13.953
- Busy?

01:11:13.953 --> 01:11:15.003
- We've got roaches.

01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:17.623
- Roaches?

01:11:17.623 --> 01:11:20.023
- Yeah, they're everywhere
it's infestation, I just,

01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:22.119
- It's interesting you'd say that.

01:11:22.119 --> 01:11:24.020
- Very interesting actually.

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:27.070
- Tell you what, here's my card.

01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:29.910
Have your wife call me at her convenience.

01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:30.743
- Okay.

01:11:30.743 --> 01:11:31.840
- [Nazir] Sir? Do you need to urinate?

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.103
- I do, I thank you. Bye.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.393
Maryanne!

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:39.803
- What's wrong?

01:11:39.803 --> 01:11:41.499
- The van was here
asking about the police.

01:11:41.499 --> 01:11:42.332
- What?

01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:43.510
- No, the police were
here asking about the van

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:44.813
and they wanted to talk to you.

01:11:44.813 --> 01:11:46.128
- What did you tell them?

01:11:46.128 --> 01:11:47.000
- I said you were busy.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.120
- Nick, why did you tell them that?

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.640
They're, they're, they're
gonna get suspicious.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.580
- I know, I just, I just started talking

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.380
and then everything went black and I, I,

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.213
I didn't know what to do,

01:11:55.213 --> 01:11:56.046
- Oh, okay, okay.
- I didn't know what to do.

01:11:56.046 --> 01:11:57.350
I didn't know what to do.
- Okay just breathe.

01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:58.820
- Going back to jail, I
don't wanna go back to jail.

01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:01.120
- No no no, no one's
going back to jail, shhh.

01:12:04.704 --> 01:12:08.287
(Andrea humming a lullaby)

01:12:13.464 --> 01:12:14.770
- All right, first we're
gonna need some roaches,

01:12:14.770 --> 01:12:16.840
go and get a box, I think I
saw some at the nightclub.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.660
Oh my gosh I cannot believe
I let you talk me into this.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.850
- What? Are you out of your mind?

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:23.380
I did not talk you into this.

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.660
- You did! You did!

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:27.950
It was the medical stuff and the,

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:29.050
the Jesus!
(Maryanne gasping)

01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:30.153
The damn Jesus!

01:12:30.153 --> 01:12:32.510
Ohh, you got me all confused in my head.

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:33.618
I was making poor decisions.

01:12:33.618 --> 01:12:34.670
- This is not my fault.

01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:37.668
You will not blame me or
my Jesus or the Holy Bible

01:12:37.668 --> 01:12:39.653
or my hostile uterus!

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:42.720
- I swear I arrested
that guy a few years ago.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.300
- He definitely knows something.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.377
- Yes he does.

01:12:45.377 --> 01:12:47.727
And that gives us probable
cause for a warrant.

01:12:49.027 --> 01:12:51.981
(distant arguing)

01:12:51.981 --> 01:12:53.693
- Tom. Tom!

01:12:53.693 --> 01:12:56.137
Tom it's me! It's Andrea!

01:12:56.137 --> 01:12:58.522
- Why, what are you talking about?

01:12:58.522 --> 01:13:00.158
- Tom! Tom!
- What was that?

01:13:00.158 --> 01:13:01.451
- Andrea.

01:13:01.451 --> 01:13:02.534
- Get the cuffs.

01:13:02.534 --> 01:13:03.549
Maryanne, get the cuffs!
- No! No Nick!

01:13:03.549 --> 01:13:05.330
Lemme go! Tom!

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:06.762
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:13:06.762 --> 01:13:08.555
(Andrea screaming)

01:13:10.013 --> 01:13:11.346
- Now what?

01:13:11.455 --> 01:13:13.649
(Andrea mumbling)

01:13:13.649 --> 01:13:14.482
What?

01:13:15.723 --> 01:13:17.770
I can't hear 'cause she's
got the tape on her mouth.

01:13:17.770 --> 01:13:18.943
- Nick focus.

01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:24.208
- [Nick] We need to get rid of her.

01:13:24.208 --> 01:13:25.340
(Andrea squeaks questioningly)

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:27.643
No, no no, not like that.

01:13:27.643 --> 01:13:30.290
We were gonna let you go anyway.

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:32.250
Just do it sooner, right?

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:33.083
- Yeah, we were.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.370
Where are we gonna take her?

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:39.575
- Go get the lampshade from our bedroom?

01:13:39.575 --> 01:13:40.540
(Andrea squeaks questioningly)

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:43.540
Put it on top of her head,
throw her in the van,

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.940
drop her off outside an antique shop.

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:49.560
It'll just look like we're
dropping off an old lamp, right?

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.970
And then when they go
outside, they go oh hey,

01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:53.223
look at this lamp, there's a person there.

01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:57.650
- Do you wanna explain
that to me one more time?

01:13:57.650 --> 01:14:02.220
- It appears a police
officer called inquiring

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:05.933
about the whereabouts of
your van, while you were out.

01:14:06.933 --> 01:14:07.766
- And?

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:14.250
- And I might have accidentally
mentioned your nickname.

01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:16.510
Allegedly.

01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:18.080
I was distracted at the moment.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.100
- Oh, okay.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.120
Lemme see this.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.370
Thank you.

01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:24.070
Does it have that part
where Veronica was talking

01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:26.800
about how Nick is too much of an idiot

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.786
and a moron to keep his mouth
shut in front of the cops?

01:14:30.786 --> 01:14:33.786
(Archie whimpering)

01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:39.663
Gentlemen, today's moving day.

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:42.433
- Oh, I hate moving day.

01:14:43.481 --> 01:14:44.663
- That's good, let's go.

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.040
- Where to boss?

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.560
- Where do you think, idiot?

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.730
Going to get the other van.

01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:52.757
- Oh.

01:14:52.774 --> 01:14:54.416
- Okay, you got it?
- I'll lift, I'll lift it

01:14:54.416 --> 01:14:55.440
down from,

01:14:57.230 --> 01:14:58.210
Maryanne.

01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:00.590
- What? I'm trying to lift her.

01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:02.590
- [Nick] Someone is looking at our lamp.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:06.210
- [Maryanne] You boys go on now.

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.910
- Yeah get out of here!
- Go on!

01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:11.150
- Shoo!
- Don't make me call your mom!

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:13.420
- Go on, we don't come to your house

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:15.490
and look at your lamps.

01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:16.389
Okay let's just,

01:15:16.389 --> 01:15:17.222
(Maryanne grunting)

01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:18.510
Here we go, okay I got it, I got it.

01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:19.343
- You got it?

01:15:19.343 --> 01:15:20.522
No we don't, okay set her down.

01:15:20.522 --> 01:15:21.430
- [Nick] Yeah, well, I got it to here.

01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:22.267
- Okay.

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:23.225
- I got it, I got it.

01:15:23.225 --> 01:15:24.058
- Okay.

01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:33.330
- Oh Nick.

01:15:33.330 --> 01:15:34.163
- Yeah?

01:15:35.648 --> 01:15:37.200
(Maryanne groaning)

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.133
Babe are you okay?

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:42.465
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:15:42.465 --> 01:15:45.410
- Okay, if you're gonna chuke,
no the window, the window.

01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:47.072
Oh please just,

01:15:47.072 --> 01:15:52.072
Aw!
(Maryanne coughing)

01:16:08.485 --> 01:16:10.770
- Nice park job, butt-hole.

01:16:10.770 --> 01:16:11.820
Let's do this.

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:13.446
- Move, come on!
- I'm moving!

01:16:13.446 --> 01:16:14.365
I'm bloody moving!

01:16:14.365 --> 01:16:15.330
(Andrea screaming distantly)

01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:17.020
Wait, there's someone in there.

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.261
- [Roach] Open it.

01:16:18.982 --> 01:16:21.180
(Tyrell groaning)
(Roach coughing)

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.550
- [Tyrell] Oh man, what's that smell?

01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:25.990
- Smells like Japanese gone wrong.

01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:27.500
Horribly wrong.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.333
(Andrea yelling through tape)

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:30.120
- My mum had a lamp like that.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.570
Wasn't a talking lamp though.

01:16:34.627 --> 01:16:36.313
(Andrea screaming and whimpering)

01:16:36.313 --> 01:16:38.150
- Is that her Tyrell?

01:16:38.150 --> 01:16:39.743
- [Tyrell] Yeah, that's her.

01:16:39.743 --> 01:16:41.970
- Okay, it looks like we're gonna take

01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:44.430
exactly what we came here for, okay?

01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:45.893
All nine months of gesteration.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.331
(hand thumping belly)
(Andrea screaming)

01:16:47.331 --> 01:16:49.330
(Archie laughing)

01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:50.997
You're driving the van.

01:16:50.997 --> 01:16:51.840
- Oh.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.910
- [Roach] Let's go get Bighead Mike.

01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:53.847
I'll drop you off.

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:58.093
- Bloody tarp.

01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:00.610
Oh, god.

01:17:03.525 --> 01:17:04.358
Really?

01:17:18.614 --> 01:17:20.690
(knocking on door)

01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:22.273
- Baby you alright?

01:17:23.383 --> 01:17:26.222
- [Maryanne] Just give me a second.

01:17:26.222 --> 01:17:28.850
- Okay, well, we gotta take that lamp

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:30.113
to the antique shop.

01:17:34.146 --> 01:17:37.750
(Nick inhales and grunts)

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:38.753
Are you alright?

01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:40.890
- Do I look alright?

01:17:42.772 --> 01:17:45.272
(Nick grunts)

01:17:46.741 --> 01:17:47.630
I got it.

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:48.463
- [Nick] Okay.

01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:54.901
- No, I don't got it.
- Go go go go go.

01:17:54.901 --> 01:17:57.000
(Maryanne vomiting)

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.180
We're gonna have to repaint, aren't we?

01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:00.968
(Maryanne coughing)

01:18:00.968 --> 01:18:02.600
You know, let's just burn
this whole room down.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.640
Oh my gosh.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.070
Are you sure you're okay?

01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:06.470
- Yeah, that sushi was a bad idea,

01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:07.643
but I'm feeling much,

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.720
- What happened to the van?

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:11.770
- It was right there.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:13.893
- Where's the van?

01:18:13.893 --> 01:18:14.726
Who took the van?

01:18:14.726 --> 01:18:15.990
- Well that's what I just said.

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:19.110
- Did the cops take the van?

01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:20.480
- Why would the police take the van?

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.320
- I don't know, maybe
it's part of some sort

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.310
of Homeland Security thing or something?

01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:26.743
- No no no no no no, it
had to be someone else.

01:18:28.776 --> 01:18:30.526
Someone must have been watching us.

01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:34.960
Well, I don't know, I (breathes heavily)

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.813
Boys did you see who took the van?

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.813
- I think I know who took her.

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:41.683
- Roach!

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:43.200
Oh this is bad.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.850
Nick, Nick what if he
does something to her.

01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:47.483
Nick, the baby.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.363
- How are we gonna
catch 'em without a car?

01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.943
Hey guys.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:00.793
Look...

01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:06.260
You guys know super heroes, right?

01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:07.370
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:08.930
- Well, probably shouldn't say this,

01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:12.920
but the Mrs. and I are super heroes.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.040
We're not wearing our
costumes or anything,

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.810
but we're trying to save this lady,

01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:19.250
a friend of hers from a bad guy.

01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:21.460
And we need to use your bikes.

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:22.293
What do you guys say?

01:19:22.293 --> 01:19:24.250
You guys wanna be some
sidekicks for the day?

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:25.313
Give us your bikes?

01:19:26.761 --> 01:19:27.594
- No.

01:19:27.594 --> 01:19:28.950
- [Maryanne] Offer them some money.

01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:30.730
- You guys take credit cards?

01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:31.563
- [Boy] No.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.830
- I know what we can give them.

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:35.663
- What?

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:39.670
Just take really really
good care of them, alright?

01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:42.460
Don't hold the corners, and
wash your hands really really

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:45.280
good before you take
'em out of the plastic.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.890
They mean a lot to me.

01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:48.733
- Come on, we gotta go.

01:19:52.527 --> 01:19:53.360
- Goodbye.

01:20:13.512 --> 01:20:15.762
- [Roach] Take her gag off.

01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:18.600
- Wait.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.420
It's best to remove it quickly.

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.840
- Are you sure?
- Mm, positive.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.200
(tape ripping)
(Andrea screaming)

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.760
Or maybe it was slow.

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:29.900
- Ow, what were you thinking?

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:30.733
- [Archie] So sorry.

01:20:30.733 --> 01:20:32.790
- I'm thinking you got one minute

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:34.107
to tell me exactly what I need to know.

01:20:34.107 --> 01:20:36.430
- I don't know anything.

01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:37.967
I was just trying to go on vacation

01:20:37.967 --> 01:20:39.860
and this couple abducted
me and they put me

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:41.520
in their basement and then they made me

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.962
wear these god awful clothes and,

01:20:44.962 --> 01:20:48.785
and then, and then she vomited in the van.

01:20:48.785 --> 01:20:51.460
(Andrea crying)

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:52.910
- You abducted a crazy woman.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:56.610
- Yeah. Arch, you're on lookout.

01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:58.410
No surprises this time.

01:20:58.410 --> 01:20:59.758
- Right, on it.

01:20:59.758 --> 01:21:01.010
(Andrea crying)

01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:02.520
- Listen to me.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.010
Look at me.

01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:06.973
I got claim on what it
is growing inside you.

01:21:08.254 --> 01:21:09.087
- What?

01:21:10.210 --> 01:21:12.940
- I'm talking about when
little baby biscuits

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:16.350
is done baking, Papa Roach
is gonna have himself

01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:17.923
a sexy little profit.

01:21:19.379 --> 01:21:20.212
- You can't.

01:21:21.269 --> 01:21:22.963
- What? What's that?

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.033
- I said you can't.

01:21:27.490 --> 01:21:28.323
- You hear that Mike?

01:21:28.323 --> 01:21:29.780
She says we can't do this no more.

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.657
- Oh man, what you gonna do Roach?

01:21:32.657 --> 01:21:33.850
- I know right?

01:21:33.850 --> 01:21:36.500
I guess we should just untie
her and just let her go.

01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:40.459
- Really? You would do that?

01:21:40.459 --> 01:21:42.423
Oh thank you.
- Yeah, no.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.283
We would never do that.

01:21:47.167 --> 01:21:48.900
(Andrea gasps)

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.010
You would do that?

01:21:52.367 --> 01:21:54.690
(knocking on door)

01:21:54.690 --> 01:21:55.706
- Police.

01:21:55.706 --> 01:21:57.558
We have a warrant to enter the premises.

01:21:58.816 --> 01:22:02.720
(dogs barking in background)

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.753
Now we go in.

01:22:14.649 --> 01:22:15.482
- Clear.

01:22:25.741 --> 01:22:26.574
Clear.

01:22:29.859 --> 01:22:32.359
Detectives you gotta see this.

01:22:38.210 --> 01:22:40.630
- What the hell kind of
pleasure palace is this?

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:46.993
Hey Tom.

01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:50.410
- What do you got Nazir?

01:22:51.497 --> 01:22:52.850
- Now correct me if I'm wrong,

01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:54.710
but that definitely looks like pictures

01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:55.623
of a baby fetus.

01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:59.113
- They could be anyone's.

01:22:59.113 --> 01:23:01.070
I found this, I think
that's Julian Van Dyke's

01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:02.030
place of business.

01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:03.960
- [Nazir] How do you know for sure?

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.793
- On the back.

01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:06.990
- Julian.

01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:08.023
- [Officer] Detective.

01:23:15.728 --> 01:23:17.090
- [Nazir] Well?

01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:17.923
- It's hers.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.560
Seal the house and canvas the area.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.393
Nazir let's go.

01:23:25.393 --> 01:23:29.112
- [Nazir] Got it, now
cover up that damn unicorn.

01:23:29.112 --> 01:23:30.252
- Nick!

01:23:30.252 --> 01:23:31.085
- What?

01:23:33.613 --> 01:23:35.521
- What are we doing here?

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:38.080
- This is where Roach
keeps all his stolen goods.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.193
I figured he might bring Andrea here.

01:23:40.193 --> 01:23:42.510
- But, do you think he
would be that stupid?

01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:43.483
- Well, apparently.

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:45.840
Look, there's the van.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:50.190
- So, what's the plan?

01:23:52.457 --> 01:23:53.290
- Plan.

01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:55.993
We come up with a plan.

01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:58.513
I've got a multitool.

01:24:00.210 --> 01:24:01.460
It's like a bat utility belt

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.323
but like you know, like smaller.

01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:07.083
- Nick, focus, focus.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.430
- Okay, new plan, gimme your phone.

01:24:22.890 --> 01:24:25.464
- Looks like someone knew we were coming.

01:24:25.464 --> 01:24:28.630
(cell phone ringing)

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:30.562
- Detective Bowers.

01:24:30.562 --> 01:24:33.581
- [Nick On Cellphone] Roach
(mumbles) Andrea here.

01:24:33.581 --> 01:24:34.939
- Who is this?

01:24:34.939 --> 01:24:37.210
- [Nick On Cellphone] Uh, okay let's

01:24:37.210 --> 01:24:39.740
(phone clicks)

01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:41.830
- Yeah, I know the place Tyrell.

01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:43.430
Okay, see you in a couple hours.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.830
Well, preg-alicious,
looks like you get to go

01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:49.303
on vacation after all.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:51.550
- Where are you taking me?

01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:54.721
- Well you're just gonna
have to find out, ain't ya?

01:24:54.721 --> 01:24:56.430
(cell phone ringing)

01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:59.720
Hold on, I gotta take this.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.553
- Please.

01:25:00.553 --> 01:25:01.593
- Don't go anywhere.

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:03.373
Roach here.

01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:07.523
Yep, of course they're primo toilet lids.

01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:10.330
No, why would I shit ya about that?

01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:32.880
- We need to make sure Andrea's okay.

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:37.030
- Nick, I really think we
should wait for the police.

01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:39.200
- The police? No.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.700
This could turn into a hostage situation.

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.400
We don't want Andrea getting hurt.

01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:45.763
Maryanne, can you trust me?

01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:49.713
- Okay, yeah.

01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:53.211
But Nick, they have guns.

01:25:53.211 --> 01:25:55.628
- That's okay, you've got me.

01:25:57.916 --> 01:25:59.333
And I've got you.

01:26:01.204 --> 01:26:02.871
Now open your purse.

01:26:16.008 --> 01:26:17.219
- What is that?

01:26:17.219 --> 01:26:18.719
- It's Saran Wrap.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:25.950
- Are you ready?

01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:27.350
- Yeah, let's kick some ass.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:34.951
That's Archie.

01:26:34.951 --> 01:26:36.853
(cartridge clatters on floor)
- Bollocks.

01:26:42.551 --> 01:26:46.968
(toilet seat clatters)
What the hell?

01:26:52.963 --> 01:26:56.183
(toilet seat lid clatters)

01:26:56.183 --> 01:26:57.733
- (sighs) I can't hit his hand.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.430
- Try aiming for a bigger target.

01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:02.667
- Who's out there?

01:27:06.587 --> 01:27:08.032
(toilet seat thunking)
oh bollocks.

01:27:08.032 --> 01:27:09.203
(gun firing)

01:27:09.203 --> 01:27:10.760
- What the hell was that?

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.223
- Sounded like a gunshot.

01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:15.210
Will you go check it out?

01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:17.650
- Roach, I came on this 'cause
you said it was a done deal.

01:27:17.650 --> 01:27:18.590
- It is.

01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:19.870
- [Mike] Doesn't sound like it.

01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:21.640
- [Roach] Well, I gotta
stay here with her.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.850
- How about I stay here with her?

01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:26.379
- Will you just trust
me and go check it out.

01:27:26.379 --> 01:27:28.079
- I don't have to do a damn thing.

01:27:29.490 --> 01:27:32.283
- Alright, tell you what,
I'll sweeten the deal.

01:27:32.283 --> 01:27:34.933
I'll give you Chloe's number,
she never calls me anyway.

01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:40.406
Fine, 60/40?

01:27:40.406 --> 01:27:41.860
- 55/45.

01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.003
- 45 you?
- Yeah.

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:55.310
- Fine, 55/45, you want my first born too?

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:57.410
- Do you even know who your first born is?

01:27:58.410 --> 01:28:01.560
- Probably not.
(both laughing)

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.860
Thanks Mike.
- Uh huh.

01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:06.626
(light clicking)

01:28:06.626 --> 01:28:07.990
(Archie moans)
(Mike gasps)

01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:09.124
Aw shit!

01:28:09.124 --> 01:28:10.590
(Archie mumbles through tape)

01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:11.971
- Who did this?

01:28:11.971 --> 01:28:13.860
(Archie mumbles through tape)

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:15.100
Are you alright?

01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:18.701
(Archie mumbles through tape)

01:28:18.701 --> 01:28:20.798
Shit, who did this to you?

01:28:21.619 --> 01:28:22.780
(Archie mumbles insistently through tape)

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.287
I can't understand you, what?

01:28:24.287 --> 01:28:26.040
(Archie mumbles through tape)

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.245
- [Nick] We've come for the girl.

01:28:28.245 --> 01:28:32.078
(Archie mumbles through tape)

01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:36.290
- I didn't sign up for
this man, I'm sorry, I.

01:28:37.388 --> 01:28:38.221
- Hmm.

01:28:55.105 --> 01:28:56.425
- Yes!

01:28:56.425 --> 01:28:58.301
Come on, come on, thank you.

01:28:58.301 --> 01:28:59.929
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:28:59.929 --> 01:29:03.099
(sirens wailing)

01:29:03.099 --> 01:29:06.165
(helicopter blades chopping)

01:29:06.165 --> 01:29:07.770
- [Officer Through
Bullhorn] Get on the ground.

01:29:07.770 --> 01:29:09.900
- [Mike] All right, okay.

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.150
I'm gonna kill you Roach.

01:29:14.792 --> 01:29:16.690
(switch clicking)
(Andrea gasping)

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:17.790
- What's going on?

01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:20.853
- Somebody's royally pissing
me off, that's what's going on.

01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:24.020
It's time to go.

01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:24.943
- [Andrea] What are you doing?

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:27.493
- You'll see.

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:38.727
Nicky is that you?

01:29:38.727 --> 01:29:40.432
(Roach grunting)

01:29:40.432 --> 01:29:42.432
Son of a, it's not fair.

01:29:43.457 --> 01:29:46.143
Deal with you in a minute, baby mama.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.513
Nicholas?

01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:52.673
I'm about done with you.

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:55.726
You hear me Nicholas?

01:29:55.726 --> 01:29:59.780
(forklift engine roaring)

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:03.010
Nick, you know what?

01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:04.353
I ain't afraid of you.

01:30:04.353 --> 01:30:07.083
Done 137 jobs, ain't never been caught.

01:30:08.150 --> 01:30:09.780
I'm uncatchable!

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:10.973
I'm unstoppable!

01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:13.890
I may even be untouchable.

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.943
Oh, so that's how it's
gonna be, huh Nicky?

01:30:19.876 --> 01:30:21.699
Bang, come at me!
(gun firing)

01:30:21.699 --> 01:30:22.532
Come on!

01:30:23.516 --> 01:30:24.850
(gun clicking)

01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:26.150
Wait.

01:30:26.150 --> 01:30:28.840
Okay, alright, I'll put down my gun,

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.191
you put down the forklift,

01:30:31.191 --> 01:30:33.678
we'll work something out.

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:36.345
I thought we were friends, Nick!

01:30:38.307 --> 01:30:39.307
- Excelsior!

01:30:40.282 --> 01:30:43.032
(purse thunking)

01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:57.433
Welcome to Job 138 Roach.

01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:03.410
Consider yourself caught,
stopped, and touched.

01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:11.160
Have fun in prison asshole.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.333
- [Maryanne] Andrea?

01:31:20.777 --> 01:31:22.410
- All right, well, great, this is great.

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:23.990
Let's go before the cops come.

01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:25.386
They're gonna be here any second alright?

01:31:25.386 --> 01:31:27.140
- [Tom] Freeze!

01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:29.150
- Or they're already here.

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:29.983
- [Andrea] Tom!

01:31:31.172 --> 01:31:32.721
- Andrea.

01:31:32.721 --> 01:31:34.171
Andrea, you're gonna be okay.

01:31:36.181 --> 01:31:38.931
(Andrea sobbing)

01:31:40.034 --> 01:31:40.867
- Come on.

01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:48.397
- Come on!
- Stop yelling in my ear!

01:31:48.397 --> 01:31:49.414
You take it easy!

01:31:49.414 --> 01:31:50.725
I'll have your badge!

01:31:50.725 --> 01:31:53.680
- [Mike] Why you put him
in the same car as me?

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.097
- I'll get you Nick!
- Aw come on!

01:31:55.097 --> 01:31:57.475
- I'll get you Nick!
- Come on!

01:31:57.767 --> 01:32:00.599
- I'll have your blood!
I'll have your blood!

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:03.090
- [Nick] Look it's gonna be okay.

01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:04.190
- You don't know that.

01:32:05.150 --> 01:32:06.360
- I've been through this before.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.410
We'll get our stories straight

01:32:07.410 --> 01:32:09.440
and then we'll have the lawyer cop a plea.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.663
- Are you telling me to,

01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:15.580
to not be completely truthful?

01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.090
- I'm saying just stretch it a little bit.

01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:19.750
It's better than what we've been doing.

01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:21.434
Maryanne, we had a person in our basement.

01:32:21.434 --> 01:32:22.267
- Shhh.

01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:30.033
- People lie all the time.

01:32:31.475 --> 01:32:33.705
Our lawyer will probably advise it.

01:32:33.705 --> 01:32:35.340
- I'm not going to go into a court of law,

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:37.900
place my hand on the Holy Bible and commit

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:39.510
the sin of perjury.

01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:42.005
My mantra through this
whole ordeal will be honesty

01:32:42.005 --> 01:32:45.263
from Detective Bowers
way on up to the judge.

01:32:47.475 --> 01:32:49.180
- I'm just saying that you can make it

01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:50.740
a whole lot easier on yourself.

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:52.470
You're too beautiful for prison.

01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:54.270
- And I'll tell you one more thing Nick,

01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:55.700
I am not going to prison.

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.410
- Where ya gonna go instead, Club Med?

01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:59.007
It's not like you're gonna
have a whole lot of say

01:32:59.007 --> 01:32:59.860
in the matter.

01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:00.693
- Yeah well,

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.080
I'm not getting a tattoo.

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.360
- Oh you're definitely getting a tattoo.

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:08.630
- My body is a temple
and the temple of God

01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:10.000
shall not be defiled.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.190
- You gotta be a part of a gang,

01:33:11.190 --> 01:33:12.820
to be in the gang you gotta get a tattoo.

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:13.667
That's how it works.

01:33:13.667 --> 01:33:14.830
- Well, they're just
gonna have to accept me

01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:15.710
the way I am.

01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:17.980
- No, they're not a
very accepting society.

01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:20.363
- So what, you're telling
me that you're in a gang?

01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:23.533
- Follow me.

01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.813
Have a seat.

01:33:31.781 --> 01:33:33.864
I need you to sign these.

01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:49.730
Okay, you're free to go.

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.153
- Really?

01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:57.503
- My sister's not pressing
charges against you.

01:33:57.503 --> 01:34:00.040
In her statement, she
claims that Mr. Van Dyke,

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:03.650
AKA Roach and his associate
Tyrell were the perpetrators

01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:04.900
of the whole thing.

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:08.160
She states that Mr. Van
Dyke, under the threat

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:11.300
of bodily harm, forced
you to keep her locked up

01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:12.313
in your basement.

01:34:19.258 --> 01:34:21.925
Do you agree with her statement?

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.310
- That's exactly how it happened officer.

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.033
- Yep, exactly like that.

01:34:33.930 --> 01:34:35.180
- Then you're free to go.

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.140
- Oh I think I'm gonna be sick,

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:39.970
do you have a ladies room?

01:34:39.970 --> 01:34:41.370
- Down the hall on the left.

01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:45.528
- Some bad sushi.

01:34:45.690 --> 01:34:48.090
I've never seen food
poisoning like that before.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.543
- Or she's pregnant.

01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.700
- [Nick] You're doing so good baby,

01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.360
you're doing so good!

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.311
Oh my gosh.

01:34:58.311 --> 01:35:01.248
(Maryanne whining)

01:35:01.248 --> 01:35:04.506
- Nurse, nurse, nurse, when is the doctor

01:35:04.506 --> 01:35:05.660
gonna get here?

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:06.869
- Everything is gonna be fine.

01:35:06.869 --> 01:35:08.844
Sometimes they just get
here in time to catch.

01:35:08.844 --> 01:35:10.726
(Maryanne growls)

01:35:10.726 --> 01:35:12.150
(Maryanne whimpers)

01:35:12.150 --> 01:35:13.050
- You're doing so good.

01:35:13.050 --> 01:35:15.647
- Nick, get that video
camera out of my face

01:35:15.647 --> 01:35:16.480
before I rip your head off,

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.758
shove it down your hole, I swear!

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.510
- [Nick] It's alright,
it's alright, you're,

01:35:21.742 --> 01:35:24.984
oh you're so sweaty, oh.

01:35:24.984 --> 01:35:27.120
- Nick, I'm not kidding, turn it off.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.430
- [Nick] This happens, once in when?

01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:31.179
We're catching it on video.

01:35:31.179 --> 01:35:33.398
- No!
(Maryanne crying)

01:35:33.398 --> 01:35:35.549
Nick! Nick I'm not kidding!

01:35:35.549 --> 01:35:38.314
I'm not kidding, turn it off.

01:35:38.314 --> 01:35:39.876
- [Nick] But you look so beautiful.

01:35:39.876 --> 01:35:42.515
- (growling) Now!

01:35:42.515 --> 01:35:46.432
(Maryanne yelling and panting)

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:53.280
(Maryanne yelling)
(baby crying)

01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:59.680
He is an honest to goodness miracle.

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.253
- Yes he is.

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:07.400
And he shall be known as, Bruce Kent.

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.380
- No.
- Wayne Clark.

01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:12.770
- Nick, no.

01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:13.603
- Nick?

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:15.990
Nick Fury.

01:36:16.957 --> 01:36:18.499
- No.
- Yes.

01:36:23.167 --> 01:36:27.167
(Archie mumbling questioningly)

01:36:32.795 --> 01:36:34.555
(Archie mumbling angrily)

01:36:34.579 --> 01:36:39.104
(jovial music)
