13:23.136 --> 13:25.804
All I'm saying,
if it's mine,

13:25.806 --> 13:29.174
I want to raise it.
Be a dad, you know.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.810
We'll raise it
together.

13:31.812 --> 13:32.443
That's what
Charlie wants.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.079
If it's my kid,
I should get some
say how it grows up.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.216
Even if it's yours,
the baby doesn't
belong to you.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.485
It belongs
to the family.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.886
(SIGHS)

13:42.422 --> 13:45.390
What the hell
are we doing
out here anyway?

13:45.392 --> 13:48.660
Quick pit stop.
Handing off a bag.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.496
Drug deal?

13:51.731 --> 13:53.531
(EXCITEDLY)
This is a drug deal?

13:53.533 --> 13:54.566
"Deal," hardly.

13:54.568 --> 13:55.767
Fella already
paid for the stuff.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.769
I'm just
the delivery man.

13:57.971 --> 13:58.536
How much is it?

13:58.538 --> 14:02.073
It's a lot. This fella,
pretty fresh out of prison,

14:02.075 --> 14:04.042
trying to start up
a new operation.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.544
My buddy had some
extra supply he sold him.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.480
Giving me a little
scratch to drop it off.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.149
So what do I do?

14:11.251 --> 14:15.086
You just sit there
and be pretty.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.189
You're good at that.

14:18.592 --> 14:19.958
(CHUCKLES)

14:19.960 --> 14:24.429
I feel bad for this guy.
Had a hell of a time
when he got out.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.931
Mind you, I don't know
how much is truth or tale,

14:26.933 --> 14:28.032
but from what I hear,

14:28.034 --> 14:30.301
he was nearly killed,
poisoned with soup.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.370
And his crew,
his only friends,
all dead.

14:32.372 --> 14:36.407
I don't know if he was
resurrected as much as just
he's a big dude, but...

14:36.409 --> 14:38.476
Tex, we gotta go.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.311
What are you
talking about?

14:40.313 --> 14:43.081
Ralph. This guy's
name is Ralph.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.482
Tex, we gotta
leave now!

14:44.484 --> 14:47.252
I got a ranch worth
of grass in my trunk
and it ain't mine,

14:47.254 --> 14:50.054
so scrunch down
and shut up.

14:56.930 --> 14:57.528
Hey, brother.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.732
Well, ain't you friendly.
Let me see.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.044
Well, all right.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.981
Who's the little thing
in there riding shotgun?

15:16.983 --> 15:21.619
She's just some
chick I picked up.
Stray, you know.

15:21.621 --> 15:22.987
(CHUCKLES)

15:22.989 --> 15:24.689
Let me see.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.658
I love alley cat.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.393
Let's do this, Ralph.
Come on.

15:28.395 --> 15:31.396
(CHUCKLES)
I'm just looking, man.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.367
Hey, girlie.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.938
Hey!

15:40.774 --> 15:42.307
What's wrong with her?

15:42.309 --> 15:44.876
She's shy.
Come on, I gotta get.

15:44.878 --> 15:47.178
(BANGING)
(GASPS)

15:48.148 --> 15:49.881
This bitch.
Oh, this bitch?

15:49.883 --> 15:51.549
(SHATTERING)
(SCREAMING)

15:52.218 --> 15:53.084
Hey, hey!

15:53.086 --> 15:55.253
Get back here.
Get off her!

15:55.255 --> 15:57.422
SADIE: Get off me! Get off!

15:57.424 --> 15:58.690
(SADIE SCREAMS)

15:58.692 --> 16:00.591
Get off me!

16:05.999 --> 16:07.565
(GUNSHOT)
(SADIE SCREAMS)

16:07.567 --> 16:08.967
(RALPH GRUNTING)

16:12.739 --> 16:14.639
(BOTH GROANING)

16:16.509 --> 16:20.011
Go, Tex! Go, go! Go!

16:22.549 --> 16:24.415
I'll kill you!

16:25.385 --> 16:28.219

That's great,

Hold on a second.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.572
What's the trouble, man?
That was working.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.440
Nothing, man.
I love this.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.175
All right, it's deep.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.877
I was just thinking,
you know, one thing.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.146
You're asking her to give
all this stuff up,

16:55.148 --> 16:57.982
so instead of
"cease to exist,"

16:58.852 --> 17:01.319
what if it was
"cease to resist"?

17:02.922 --> 17:06.557
That's what I'm saying,
but it ain't all I'm saying.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.360
Yeah, no, I get that.
It's just...

17:10.397 --> 17:12.663
It's pop songs, Charlie.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.965
They want to be simple.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.867
Something they
can sing along to,
you know?

17:15.869 --> 17:18.236
Hell, this ain't
no damn sing-along.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.938
I'm trying to give
folks what they need,

17:20.940 --> 17:22.907
a juicy helping
of uncut truth.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.776
Charlie!
Charlie!

17:24.778 --> 17:26.511
We ain't changing...
SADIE: Charlie!

17:26.513 --> 17:27.712
What?

17:27.714 --> 17:28.679
We messed up, bad.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.249
We accidentally
stole a fortune
in drugs.

17:31.251 --> 17:34.652
Fortuitous timing.
Rations were running low.
What do you got?

17:34.654 --> 17:35.987
No, no, no.
That's not what I'm...

17:35.989 --> 17:38.423
Take a breath there,
little bird.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.793
Ralph Church is alive.

17:43.797 --> 17:45.630
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

17:47.033 --> 17:49.267
Live long enough,
you see everything.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.370
This is not a joke.
He wants to kill you.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.305
Hey, everybody calm down.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.708
He can't kill me.
I can't die.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.812
Charlie, I love you,
but I am serious.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.246
We need to take care of...

18:02.248 --> 18:03.581
(MUMBLES)

18:04.651 --> 18:06.417
You're serious?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.219
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

18:12.659 --> 18:16.360
CUT: He had a packed
suitcase. Said he was
going to visit Mom.

18:16.362 --> 18:19.030
I asked, had he made
those plans before

18:19.032 --> 18:20.865
or after he stabbed
an old lady?

18:20.867 --> 18:21.666
How'd that
work out for you?

18:21.668 --> 18:24.735
Yeah, well, hold on
to your shorts.
He says he's innocent.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.671
Get in there and
close this damn thing.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.106
There you are.
Come in here.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.175
Why don't you take
this guy? I gotta go
look at those letters.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.911
Whoa, whoa.
You're dumping
this on him?

18:33.913 --> 18:35.379
I'm delegating.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.816
GRACE: It is about
the younger generation.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.719
They're the future
and lifeblood
of the party, and...

18:41.721 --> 18:46.057
I don't know, I think
it helps to see young
faces at a political rally.

18:46.059 --> 18:48.793
Well, I couldn't
pay my kids to come
to a fundraiser.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.027
Death by boredom.
(LAUGHS)

18:50.029 --> 18:54.866
Oh, I understand.
Mine's the same.
Uh, cream and sugar, Becky?

18:55.068 --> 18:57.502
When do we finally
get to meet Emma?

18:57.504 --> 18:59.770
Semester must
be done soon.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.873
Well, she's fallen
in love with France.

19:01.875 --> 19:05.676
Can't say I blame her.
I think she might
extend her stay.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.847
GRACE: Hi, Daddy.
MAN: (ON PHONE)
<i> Everything okay?</i>

19:09.849 --> 19:11.916
No, everything's fine.
Ken's great.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.218
We're very involved
in the campaign and...

19:14.220 --> 19:16.754
Well, I think it could be
great for both of us.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.789
<i> You're working on something</i>
<i> for the campaign now?</i>

19:18.791 --> 19:21.492
Yes, actually.
Tea with the ladies.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.093
<i> How are the ladies?</i>

19:22.095 --> 19:25.429
Oh, just complaining
about their figures
and their kids.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.698
(CHUCKLES) <i> Terribly exciting.</i>

19:28.468 --> 19:30.401
Daddy, they keep
asking about Emma.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.236
<i> Well, you keep telling them</i>
<i> she's traveling.</i>

19:32.238 --> 19:36.240
I know, I just...
I don't think I can
keep it up much longer.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.241
<i> Why not?</i>

19:37.243 --> 19:39.443
Because she's in
Los Angeles, she's...

19:39.445 --> 19:40.745
God knows
what she's doing.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.047
<i> We have to stick</i>
<i> to the same story.</i>

19:43.049 --> 19:44.315
I think...

19:45.585 --> 19:48.186
I think we need
to do something.

19:51.024 --> 19:55.059
Shoot-out.
Two officers hit.
Three Panthers dead.

19:55.595 --> 19:55.927
Where?

19:55.929 --> 19:59.330
Gas station. Down near
Panthers' headquarters.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.532
Kristin, you got to...

20:01.534 --> 20:03.034
Go, go.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.808
(TIRES SCREECHING)

20:12.178 --> 20:15.513
No, I don't know anything
right now, sir.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

20:15.515 --> 20:17.949
BRIAN: Kristin.
Kristin, is she okay?
I understand.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.218
Tell me!
You know Kristin Shafe.
I'm her husband.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.054
I'm the only white cop
that comes in and
out of here, okay?

20:23.056 --> 20:25.022
I can have a wagon
down here in five minutes,

20:25.024 --> 20:25.890
get you all
on obstruction.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.892
KRISTIN: Sorry,
I have to go.
Baby!

20:29.362 --> 20:31.829
Hey, guys,
that's my husband.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.731
You okay?
What in the hell
are you doing here?

20:33.733 --> 20:34.999
You cannot be here
right now.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.634
To see if my wife
is alive or dead?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.035
Yeah, I think
I can stop by.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.670
I'm fine.
Now please leave.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.305
Baby, you're not
staying here.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.741
That's not
your decision.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.410
Sweetheart,
it's just not safe.
Bernadette...

20:46.412 --> 20:49.547
You do not get
to use that on me.

20:50.283 --> 20:53.184
Officer Shafe,
you need to
get out of here.

20:53.987 --> 20:55.953
You don't like
that feeling?

20:55.955 --> 20:58.889
Wondering if I'm okay,
if I'm coming home?

20:58.891 --> 21:01.359
Who's gonna watch
after Bernadette?

21:01.361 --> 21:03.261
Well, neither do I.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.529
So now it's your turn.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.633
I will see you
at the house.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.479
Police chop off
your hair?

21:21.714 --> 21:24.982
Yeah. Kristin took
care of my balls.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.018
Excuse me.

21:33.593 --> 21:37.261
Hey, Wanda?
I'm Perry's friend.

21:38.931 --> 21:42.266
Thank you.
What you reading?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.738
I read that in college.

21:48.574 --> 21:50.708
Outside of class.
(CHUCKLES)

21:52.211 --> 21:54.745
Anything else, or...
No.

21:55.248 --> 21:56.480
Yeah.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.950
Are you okay?

21:59.952 --> 22:01.619
This your first day?

22:02.355 --> 22:03.754
Two months. The SDS.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.857
Yeah, they're not where
the Panthers are at.

22:06.859 --> 22:07.558
But you'll see.

22:07.560 --> 22:11.095
Once the group
goes violent,
the boys do, too.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.029
If they haven't already.

22:12.031 --> 22:16.300
I know men.
They're unconscious.
They don't think.

22:16.302 --> 22:17.535
They're just
chauvinists...

22:17.537 --> 22:20.137
They're what?
Chauvinist pigs.

22:20.373 --> 22:24.942
Tell our friend I said hi,
and maybe next time,
send a grown-up.

22:25.211 --> 22:28.412
You have a great
little day, miss.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.381
Yes, at Dennis Wilson's
house. It's gated.

22:30.383 --> 22:33.517
MAN: (ON PHONE)
<i> Are you sure she's there?</i>
KEN: Grace!

22:33.519 --> 22:34.018
<i> Grace?</i>

22:34.020 --> 22:37.888
I won't be
at dinner tonight.
Late meeting.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.090
Okay.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.224
Who you talking to?

22:40.226 --> 22:42.126
It's my father.
He's giving me
campaign advice.

22:42.128 --> 22:46.497
"Be the prettier one"
should cover it.
Give him my regards.

22:48.267 --> 22:51.836
I'm sorry. It was Ken.
He doesn't know yet.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.237
<i> Well, you need to tell him.</i>

22:53.239 --> 22:55.706
I'll tell him
once we have Emma.

23:02.248 --> 23:05.649
What'd I miss?
Besides your job?

23:05.651 --> 23:08.519
Bennie didn't do it.
In fact, he wasn't
even fired.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.121
He quit,
after the old lady

23:10.123 --> 23:12.923
called him "spade"
one too many times.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.992
So what's next?
You want me to get in...

23:14.994 --> 23:18.162
No. I want you
to stay.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.198
Stay.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.738
Sorry to make you wait,
Miss Wallace.
What happened with Bennie?

23:27.740 --> 23:31.409
<i> Bennie didn't do it.</i>
<i> We sent him home.</i>

23:31.711 --> 23:33.210
DIERDRE: <i> Okay.</i>

23:34.080 --> 23:36.147
You knew Miss Becker.
You grew up with her.

23:36.149 --> 23:40.017
Mmm-hmm.
Can you tell me
about her?

23:40.486 --> 23:41.419
(SIGHS)

23:41.421 --> 23:44.321
She was generous.
Mmm.

23:44.323 --> 23:46.690
Always.
Hmm-mmm.

23:46.692 --> 23:47.925
Particular.
(LAUGHS)

23:47.927 --> 23:52.496
Only one way
to do anything.
But so kind.

23:52.498 --> 23:55.499
(CHUCKLES) We could
use her around here,
it sounds like.

23:55.501 --> 23:56.834
(BOTH LAUGH)

23:57.336 --> 23:58.803
DIERDRE: <i> I'll never</i>
<i> forget this.</i>

23:58.805 --> 24:00.738
She let me have
my sweet sixteen

24:00.740 --> 24:01.505
at her house.
Mmm-hmm.

24:01.507 --> 24:06.677
<i> I got to invite</i>
<i> all my friends. They were</i>
<i> in awe of the place.</i>

24:07.079 --> 24:09.046
It was a palace.

24:09.148 --> 24:12.550
Made me feel like
a queen the whole day.

24:12.852 --> 24:16.554
(CHUCKLES) Of course
I still had to
clean up afterwards.

24:16.556 --> 24:21.559
I bet your mom
is happy to see her,
though. Up there.

24:22.195 --> 24:25.129
What do you think
they're talking about?

24:25.465 --> 24:27.798
Think they're
talking about you?

24:28.267 --> 24:31.302
I suppose.
What do you think
they're saying?

24:32.705 --> 24:34.805
Actually, they wouldn't
be talking much.

24:34.807 --> 24:39.243
Miss Becker, she
wasn't much of a talker.
I'd like to go now, please.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.445
Well, Bennie told me
different, actually.

24:41.447 --> 24:43.514
Bennie said she liked
to talk a lot.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.617
Said her favorite
word was "spade."

24:46.686 --> 24:48.285
She ever call you
that? "Spade"?

24:48.287 --> 24:50.120
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.823
SAM: <i> What about</i>
<i> "jungle bunny, tar baby"?</i>

24:52.825 --> 24:53.357
DIERDRE: <i> Stop it.</i>

24:53.359 --> 24:57.461
Deirdre, what did
she call you, "monkey"?
'Cause that's what you are.

24:57.463 --> 24:58.462
Look at you,
just lying here right...

24:58.464 --> 25:01.265
I don't want to hate
coloreds, but you're
just lying to my face.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.533
<i> You're not helping</i>
<i> your cause at all.</i>

25:02.535 --> 25:04.735
Now what did she say to you
to make you want to...

25:04.737 --> 25:05.636
That's enough!
Get out!

25:05.638 --> 25:08.105
What did she say
to make you want
to kill her?

25:08.107 --> 25:09.306
(CRYING)
You can't even fool me.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.275
You think you're
gonna fool God?

25:11.444 --> 25:13.611
All those things she
called you, you are.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.045
That made you
want to kill her.

25:15.047 --> 25:18.182
Damn it, get out.
If IA gets wind of this...

25:18.184 --> 25:20.117
You cannot do this.
What is wrong with you?

25:20.119 --> 25:22.553
I'm being dragged
out of a case that
I'm closing by an idiot!

25:22.555 --> 25:25.422
Closing? Are you kidding me?
You are making a woman cry.

25:25.424 --> 25:26.590
Who is not your wife!

25:26.592 --> 25:27.291
I know.
Do you?

25:27.293 --> 25:29.159
Yes.
Patron saint of
the underserved.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.962
Hodiak...
She's not a victim!
She's a murderer!

25:31.964 --> 25:32.630
Then prove it!
Prove it!

25:32.632 --> 25:36.734
Don't lecture me on a job
I've been doing since
you couldn't wipe your ass.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.569
Are you
hearing yourself?

25:38.571 --> 25:40.237
Are you hearing me?

25:40.606 --> 25:42.506
(CRYING CONTINUES)

25:45.645 --> 25:47.144
Stop.

25:48.514 --> 25:51.048
She wouldn't stop.

25:51.984 --> 25:55.486
(WAILING) I couldn't
take it anymore!

25:55.688 --> 25:56.754
(SOFTLY) It's okay.

25:56.756 --> 25:59.089
I couldn't
take it anymore.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.191
Good job, Detective.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.296
I'm sorry.

26:05.298 --> 26:07.298
Let's just
sit down.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.501
I'm so sorry!

26:17.510 --> 26:19.310
Is that actual
police work?

26:19.312 --> 26:20.778
I went through all the
lonely hearts letters

26:20.780 --> 26:22.746
for phone numbers
and addresses.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.548
Everyone was a married
man, wife and kids.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.850
Nothing worse
than a public intox
on any of them.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.686
We're a classy gender,
aren't we?

26:28.688 --> 26:29.420
(LAUGHS)
Except for one.

26:29.422 --> 26:32.156
Asked her to meet him
at an address that was
an auto body shop

26:32.158 --> 26:35.526
until it closed
five years ago,
empty storefront since.

26:35.528 --> 26:37.728
That's the rendezvous.
The letter?

26:37.730 --> 26:40.831
No prints.
Same for other
letters from him.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.967
So it's a clue
and a dead end.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.835
Oh, I got here
just in time.

26:44.837 --> 26:47.404
Hey, I heard
you questioned
that maid so good,

26:47.406 --> 26:48.906
she tried to give herself
the death penalty.

26:48.908 --> 26:53.811
You know, sometimes
I think I'm a bad person,
and then you arrive.

26:53.813 --> 26:54.511
You're welcome.

26:54.513 --> 26:57.548
Now, I got three more
cases with your
name on them.

26:57.550 --> 27:00.284
And since these
are, as you say,
a dead end,

27:00.286 --> 27:04.188
you can get back
to working on actual
murder cases.

27:04.190 --> 27:07.091
It's not like
it's a thankless job.

27:11.597 --> 27:12.963
(CHUCKLES)

27:14.667 --> 27:16.700
White House Counsel.

27:16.702 --> 27:17.534
I'm sorry?

27:17.536 --> 27:22.206
My appointment.
White House Counsel.
That's what I want.

27:22.508 --> 27:25.776
You, uh, might have
to work for it.

27:25.778 --> 27:30.447
Johnson bullied
the South Vietnamese
into a cease-fire deal.

27:30.449 --> 27:31.048
What are the terms?

27:31.050 --> 27:34.985
We don't know.
Not great for Saigon,
but good enough.

27:37.223 --> 27:41.659
For our honeymoon,
Grace wanted to go
to Paris. I didn't.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.427
Filthy city, no beach.

27:43.429 --> 27:47.398
So I told her that
I had a secret honeymoon
planned for us,

27:47.400 --> 27:51.835
but she'd have to wait
until after the wedding
to find out.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.003
Where'd you go?

27:53.005 --> 27:53.704
We didn't have one.

27:53.706 --> 27:57.975
I had work,
she had the kid.
It all fell through.

27:58.411 --> 27:59.977
No Paris.

27:59.979 --> 28:05.315
We tell Saigon we'll offer
them a better deal
after the election.

28:05.384 --> 28:09.787
What you're suggesting
is a violation
of the Logan Act.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.088
Then when Nixon
is elected,

28:11.090 --> 28:17.428
I, his counsel,
will advise him
not to prosecute.

28:29.742 --> 28:31.642
BUNCHY: Sister.
(GASPS)

28:31.811 --> 28:33.977
You scared me.
(CHUCKLES)

28:34.714 --> 28:36.814
Where do you
want to be shot?

28:37.817 --> 28:40.451
Now you're really
scaring me.

28:40.453 --> 28:42.786
Everybody's got a spot.

28:43.689 --> 28:46.457
Most say forehead
'cause it's quick.

28:46.459 --> 28:50.294
But it doesn't work
all the time, and
you end up a vegetable.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.195
Heart's a good
possibility,

28:51.197 --> 28:55.099
but if the shooter misses,
you drown in your own blood.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.468
If I had a choice,

28:58.571 --> 29:01.038
medulla oblongata.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.073
System shuts down.

29:03.709 --> 29:06.510
No pain, instant.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.646
Not too bad, considering.

29:09.648 --> 29:11.749
Brother Bunchy,
I don't understand.

29:11.751 --> 29:15.552
Your husband was wrong
for coming down here,
but not about why.

29:15.554 --> 29:18.388
Everyone in the movement's
ready to be killed.

29:18.390 --> 29:22.292
I understand the risks.
You have to embrace it.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.095
Every day you leave
your daughter to come here.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.998
That's the last time
she sees your face.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.200
Just 'cause
you picked a spot,

29:30.202 --> 29:33.637
doesn't mean you won't get
a shotgun to the nose.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.873
We're lucky to have you.

29:35.875 --> 29:40.010
But you gotta know
what being here
really means.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.348
Get home safe, sister.

29:50.790 --> 29:54.258
CHARLIE: Now
I ain't saying you went
looking for this evil,

29:54.260 --> 29:55.926
but it found you.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.128
It chose you.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.998
So it's gotta be
you to respond.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.566
Charlie.

30:02.568 --> 30:07.738
There's gotta be
another way. I...
This... This ain't me.

30:07.740 --> 30:10.374
This here is life.

30:10.509 --> 30:13.010
Obstacle and action.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.879
Go on.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.182
Pick it up.
(SNIFFLES)

30:23.022 --> 30:24.488
I don't want to.
Damn it!

30:24.490 --> 30:27.324
You brought this evil
from the past upon us.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.794
You will
take care of it.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

30:30.796 --> 30:34.097
Come on. You can do it.
I know you can.

30:34.099 --> 30:34.798
(DOOR OPENS)

30:34.800 --> 30:37.401
Charlie, you gotta...
What the hell?

30:37.403 --> 30:39.036
Come on in.
Join the fun.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.471
EMMA: What is this?
It's a pep talk.

30:41.473 --> 30:45.809
See, the devil has delivered
Ralph Church back to us

30:45.811 --> 30:47.945
right as we're on
the cusp of recording,

30:47.947 --> 30:51.448
getting our message,
our love, out into the world.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.451
But Tex is going
to protect us.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.887
So, what, you're gonna
kill Ralph again?

30:56.889 --> 30:59.456
We're gonna do
what needs to be done

30:59.458 --> 31:02.793
to protect our family,
to protect the mission.

31:02.995 --> 31:06.363
We pointed guns at him,
poisoned him, moved here.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.432
He still turns up.

31:09.635 --> 31:13.270
Seems like we're more
safe when he's in jail.

31:14.940 --> 31:18.108
Remember that cop
friend of yours?

31:18.711 --> 31:19.276
The one that beat me

31:19.278 --> 31:23.146
till I was a bloody
pulp at the foot
of the pearly gates?

31:27.286 --> 31:30.187
You still able
to get to him?
(GASPING SOFTLY)

31:31.757 --> 31:34.691
Yeah. Yeah, I can.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.009
Hey.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.045
How you doing?

31:56.282 --> 31:57.581
I get it now.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.782
When you're the one
in danger,

31:58.784 --> 32:01.885
you don't have
time to be afraid.

32:02.922 --> 32:06.223
You were all I could
think about today.

32:06.225 --> 32:09.993
Was it like that for you,
when I was undercover?

32:15.901 --> 32:17.868
I don't know, Bri.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.005
(KRISTIN SIGHS)

32:24.910 --> 32:25.842
I don't know
what to do.

32:25.844 --> 32:30.247
I don't wanna spend
all day, the rest
of my life, in this house.

32:30.249 --> 32:33.984
But I don't want to risk...
A babysitter. Miss Lopez?

32:33.986 --> 32:35.052
(CHUCKLES) You mean
the expensive one?

32:35.054 --> 32:41.391
Maybe she'd give us
a discount if she was
every day, like a nanny.

32:43.495 --> 32:44.895
What are you saying?

32:44.897 --> 32:46.430
Maybe you go to school.

32:46.432 --> 32:50.267
And not just night classes,
a full-time thing.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.935
Get a fancy degree.

32:51.937 --> 32:57.541
Write a bunch of books
about whatever
it is you want.

32:58.110 --> 33:02.913
You got to have your
boots on the ground
to change the world.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.885
You're laying out
this perfect life,

33:08.887 --> 33:12.356
but you still can't
tell me that you're using?

33:13.625 --> 33:15.025
What?

33:15.327 --> 33:19.062
I found it.
Uh, the needle
and the...

33:19.064 --> 33:20.163
No, no,
that was for work.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.899
That was just for work.
I just had to make it
look like I did.

33:22.901 --> 33:25.102
Please, please, don't.

33:25.104 --> 33:29.039
Baby, I can't tell you
anything but the truth.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.443
I'm sorry I brought it
in the house.

33:33.445 --> 33:37.681
You're gonna look me
in the eye and tell me
that that's the truth?

33:37.683 --> 33:38.949
Yes.

33:40.486 --> 33:41.685
Baby, come on.

33:41.687 --> 33:45.188
Honest, that is
the truth. Okay?

34:16.488 --> 34:21.725
Hey, Adams? It's Sam Hodiak.
Are you still working
the crime beat?

34:22.094 --> 34:23.994
You want a story or not?

34:23.996 --> 34:26.897
Yeah, there's this walking
bowel movement out there

34:26.899 --> 34:31.835
who's trying to get my
attention by killing girls.

34:37.142 --> 34:38.608
KRISTIN: Honey?

34:40.245 --> 34:42.179
Get me a glass, too?

34:43.215 --> 34:44.548
Yeah.

35:17.116 --> 35:17.981
You seem upset.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.616
You've pulled
some crap, Sammy,

35:19.618 --> 35:21.351
but going to the press
behind my back?

35:21.353 --> 35:24.087
I thought it was
time to make it
a two-way conversation.

35:24.089 --> 35:25.522
"He's just an amateur.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.791
"It's only a matter
of time before
he slips up."

35:27.793 --> 35:28.558
What is this,
a challenge?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.560
The guy's gonna
stay in the woodwork
unless we draw him out.

35:30.562 --> 35:33.330
No, no, no.
The only thing
this is gonna do

35:33.332 --> 35:35.398
is egg him on.
You...

35:36.001 --> 35:39.436
Sorry. Hodiak, there's
a broad to see you.

35:39.438 --> 35:43.540
Darn... Barn. No,
it's not Barn, it's...

35:43.876 --> 35:44.641
Karn?

35:44.643 --> 35:45.809
Yeah, that sounds right.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.544
Because it is, Conway.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.079
What, did you put her
in a shoebox?

35:49.081 --> 35:49.880
No, I put her
in the break room.

35:49.882 --> 35:54.417
I thought you
and Grace were
doing your own thing.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.155
I'll fill you in
later, Dear Abby.

36:06.565 --> 36:07.831
Detective Hodiak.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.666
For the record,
not a "broad."

36:09.668 --> 36:13.737
I just wanted to tell you,
show you, that my life's
back on track now.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.205
We're not living
in that house anymore.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.073
I'm staying with Dennis Wilson
of the Beach Boys.

36:17.075 --> 36:18.775
He's helping me
start a music career.

36:18.777 --> 36:24.181
So you came back
just to thank
an old guy in a tie?

36:24.516 --> 36:27.684
Or you want to tell me
why you're really here?

36:28.587 --> 36:30.954
Look, Dennis has
been great for us.

36:30.956 --> 36:35.892
All Charlie does now
is just play music.
Every day, that's it.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.027
If your next word
isn't "but,"

36:37.029 --> 36:41.097
I'm gonna need another
cup of coffee to keep me
awake during this.

36:41.099 --> 36:42.599
But...

36:43.635 --> 36:45.235
There's this guy.

36:45.237 --> 36:46.503
From Charlie's past.

36:46.505 --> 36:50.607
He's been on our tail
and I'm just afraid that...

36:51.476 --> 36:54.010
He's the one that
taught Charlie to pimp.

36:54.012 --> 36:59.783
And I heard this guy say
that he wanted to start
back up again, with me.

37:00.052 --> 37:00.350
Hmm.

37:00.352 --> 37:05.555
What about your, uh,
beach boy friend?
He can't keep you safe?

37:05.557 --> 37:07.657
He'd get himself
killed trying.

37:07.659 --> 37:10.293
He's not a fighter.
He's a drummer.

37:10.662 --> 37:11.895
(LAUGHS)

37:12.130 --> 37:14.431
Well, unfortunately
we can't lock up people

37:14.433 --> 37:16.866
for what they want to do,
so unless he actually...

37:16.868 --> 37:21.972
He's on parole.
And he attacked
my friends yesterday.

37:23.508 --> 37:24.808
Okay.

37:24.876 --> 37:27.611
His name is Ralph Church.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.213
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

37:51.436 --> 37:53.236
Miss Karn.
Yes?

37:53.238 --> 37:55.905
Mr. Wilson sent us
for you.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.209
Miss.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.645
Thank you.

38:15.193 --> 38:16.226
The cops shot first.

38:16.228 --> 38:19.129
Those Panthers did nothing.
Nothing but stand tall.

38:19.131 --> 38:20.730
They got gunned down
because they think.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.366
The Man's biggest fear
is anybody who
uses their brain.

38:23.368 --> 38:26.636
That's what we do.
We do it every day.

38:27.372 --> 38:29.306
That's why I got this.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.475
I say everyone
here do the same.

38:32.477 --> 38:36.780
'Cause next time
that story's on the
6:00, it could be us.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.282
(LAUGHING)

38:41.219 --> 38:42.886
It won't be us.

38:43.255 --> 38:43.853
You want to say why not?

38:43.855 --> 38:46.556
Those cops didn't
shoot the Panthers
'cause they think.

38:46.558 --> 38:49.359
They shot them 'cause
they're scared of them.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.428
But us?
Sleep tight,
we're fine.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.363
All right, okay.
Hell, they hardly
even know we exist.

38:53.365 --> 38:55.398
That's enough
out of you today.
On campus we're a name,

38:55.400 --> 38:58.268
but off campus, in the
middle of the country,
where the voters...

38:58.270 --> 38:59.436
Hey, listen.
We've had enough
of you talking.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.504
We're just the kids
who skip class,
call it a sit-in.

39:01.506 --> 39:04.441
Yeah, well, if that bomb
would have gone off,
different story.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.276
Well, it didn't, so...

39:07.412 --> 39:10.313
All right, well,
the next time
we send a message,

39:10.315 --> 39:11.281
we'll make sure
it's heard.

39:11.283 --> 39:14.084
What are we talking about?
Shooting people?

39:14.086 --> 39:15.352
Darling, we're talking.

39:15.354 --> 39:18.321
Am I not a part
of this group?
No, you are.

39:18.323 --> 39:19.055
Very vital role, too.

39:19.057 --> 39:22.559
You know, 'cause
none of us guys
can get ourselves off.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.461
(MEN LAUGHING)
Charmain, let's go.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.529
(SOFTLY) I wanna stay here.

39:27.099 --> 39:30.500
Provoke?
Provoke them
to do what?

39:30.569 --> 39:32.202
I really
can't say.

39:32.204 --> 39:34.704
Are these dangerous
people, you think?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.806
Yeah. They are.

39:36.808 --> 39:41.177
You know, when I worked
undercover at the
homo bars in Vice,

39:41.179 --> 39:43.546
I went way past
my comfortable.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.915
But you can't actually
arrest them until
they break the law.

39:45.917 --> 39:49.886
Sam, this is not some
homo kissing charge.
This is...

39:51.456 --> 39:53.556
What is it
exactly, then?

39:53.558 --> 39:55.458
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

39:55.460 --> 39:56.926
I don't know how to...

39:56.928 --> 40:00.497
I can't talk about it
'cause I'm not allowed
to talk about it.

40:00.499 --> 40:05.735
Okay, good.
Well, I'm glad we had
this heart-to-heart.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.203
Please.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.008
You're Laika.

40:12.144 --> 40:12.475
Who?

40:12.477 --> 40:17.313
Laika. First dog in space?
Cute, too, for a Russian.

40:17.449 --> 40:17.981
Excuse me?

40:17.983 --> 40:20.650
Okay. Look around.
You're the first
of your kind.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.686
Do you see any other woman
doing the kind of police
work you're doing?

40:23.688 --> 40:28.024
Anybody who's gotten
as far as, nearly as far
as you have?

40:28.026 --> 40:29.159
What does that have
to do with this?

40:29.161 --> 40:31.327
Nothing, except
everybody's watching you,

40:31.329 --> 40:33.563
and not with a big generosity
of heart, either.

40:33.565 --> 40:37.700
So if you fail or quit
because of your feelings,

40:37.702 --> 40:39.803
then everybody's gonna
get a chance to say

40:39.805 --> 40:40.703
that they were
right all along,

40:40.705 --> 40:42.305
and you'll have to
go back to cleaning

40:42.307 --> 40:44.073
coffee pots for good.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.675
So I'm supposed
to just...

40:45.677 --> 40:48.845
Pick. But carefully.

40:49.347 --> 40:50.814
OFFICER CONWAY:
Detective Hodiak?
Yeah.

40:50.816 --> 40:51.981
There's a call
for you up front.

40:51.983 --> 40:56.019
Can you make it
so that it's a call
for me right here?

40:57.889 --> 40:59.556
Yes, sir. Yeah.

41:00.225 --> 41:01.591
Yeah.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.197
(RINGING)

41:07.666 --> 41:08.331
Hodiak.

41:08.333 --> 41:10.433
MAN: <i> Samson Benedictus Hodiak?</i>

41:10.836 --> 41:13.136
<i> Number one detective in LA?</i>

41:13.138 --> 41:16.306
<i> I saw the paper today.</i>
<i> Nice of you to say hi.</i>

41:16.308 --> 41:16.739
Who is this?

41:16.741 --> 41:22.178
<i> I've gotta go.</i>
<i> Business to take care of.</i>
<i> Be in touch soon.</i>

41:22.180 --> 41:24.047
(LINE DISCONNECTS)

41:27.853 --> 41:28.318
What was that?

41:28.320 --> 41:31.621
It's that creep
sending me
those photographs.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.859
I recognize that voice.
