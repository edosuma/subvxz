00:01.918 --> 00:04.713
{\an5}MOLLY:
<i>I went to space</i>
<i>on a 13-month solo mission.</i>

00:04.796 --> 00:06.631
<i>I didn't come home alone.</i>

00:06.715 --> 00:09.843
<i>The child-- part human,</i>
<i>part alien--</i>

00:09.926 --> 00:11.928
<i>was unlike anything</i>
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

00:12.011 --> 00:14.389
<i>My other child is</i>
<i>a lifelike android.</i>

00:14.472 --> 00:16.140
Mom?

00:16.224 --> 00:17.809
<i>He has become the prototype</i>
<i>for a new breed</i>

00:17.892 --> 00:21.146
<i>of thinking machines</i>
<i>called Humanichs.</i>

00:21.229 --> 00:23.356
<i>These two extraordinary</i>
<i>new life-forms</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:26.067
<i>now hold the key</i>
<i>to Earth's future.</i>

00:26.151 --> 00:27.652
<i>But where does that leave us?</i>

00:27.736 --> 00:30.155
<i>Over 99% of all species</i>

00:30.238 --> 00:33.491
<i>that have ever existed</i>
<i>have gone extinct.</i>

00:33.575 --> 00:36.953
<i>What if it's our time?</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:41.166
<i>Previously on</i> Extant:

00:41.249 --> 00:42.500
You haven't told me your name.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.918
Ahdu.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.754
Who is he?
My son.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.797
There are 29 known deaths.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.257
All women who died from

00:49.340 --> 00:50.508
<i>accelerated pregnancies.</i>

00:50.592 --> 00:51.718
SHEPHERD:
<i>All of which trace back</i>

00:51.801 --> 00:53.011
<i>to your son.</i>

00:53.094 --> 00:54.846
Dad, I'm pregnant.

00:54.929 --> 00:55.972
LUCY:
<i>Do they know you haven't put</i>

00:56.055 --> 00:57.724
the limiters on me yet?

00:59.684 --> 01:01.978
(woman screams)

01:02.061 --> 01:05.230
Lucy made her first hybrid kill.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.194
Ethan, I'm your mother.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.196
No. She is.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.614
MOLLY:
<i>How the hell did Julie Gelineu</i>

01:12.697 --> 01:14.032
end up with my son?

01:14.115 --> 01:16.534
It's complicated.
When things get complicated...

01:16.618 --> 01:18.620
<i>does somebody end up</i>
<i>getting hit by a train?</i>

01:18.703 --> 01:21.498
Unlock the door!

01:21.581 --> 01:23.541
{\an3}I don't care
how many times you try

01:23.625 --> 01:25.543
<i>to erase me from his memory--</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:28.046
I'm his mother.
Look at yourself, Molly.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.799
<i>Are you even capable</i>
<i>of taking care of a child?</i>

01:30.882 --> 01:33.009
{\an5}MOLLY:
<i>Something is happening</i>
<i>to me. I'm going crazy.</i>

01:33.092 --> 01:34.552
Don't touch me!

01:40.099 --> 01:41.184
Who did that?

01:41.267 --> 01:42.936
I think I did.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.815
{\an1}RICHTER:
So that's...

01:46.898 --> 01:48.358
{\an3}My DNA.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.360
Yeah.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.654
It's a triple helix.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.447
{\an1}Triple?

01:54.531 --> 01:57.867
{\an1}Human DNA is a double helix,
if memory serves.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.246
It <i> was</i> me, JD.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.332
{\an1}I caused that guy
to run into traffic.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.334
I'm changing.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.336
Into what?

02:08.419 --> 02:11.631
Somehow, my DNA has combined

02:11.714 --> 02:14.801
with alien DNA.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.469
I think I'm becoming

02:16.553 --> 02:18.054
a cross-breed of...

02:18.137 --> 02:19.556
{\an3}species.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.891
{\an1}How is that
even possible?

02:21.975 --> 02:25.687
Maybe it happened with
the spores when I was in space.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.607
{\an1}Maybe the GSC
did something to you.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.110
Or maybe...

02:32.193 --> 02:34.529
the baby did.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.781
You took biology, right?

02:36.865 --> 02:40.034
I was a solid D-minus student

02:40.118 --> 02:42.203
like 30 years ago,
so don't ask to test

02:42.287 --> 02:44.205
my recall.
Okay.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.291
Well, there's
something called a...

02:46.374 --> 02:48.293
fetal microchimerism.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.128
During pregnancy,

02:50.211 --> 02:53.298
a mother and child
share cells and DNA.

02:53.381 --> 02:56.926
Now, the fetal cells can linger
in a mother's body for decades,

02:57.010 --> 02:58.720
altering her blood
and her brain.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.221
But if the baby

03:00.305 --> 03:02.724
you're carrying isn't human...

03:02.807 --> 03:04.392
{\an1}Exactly.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.394
So the headaches, the voices,

03:06.477 --> 03:09.105
the sexual appetite--

03:09.188 --> 03:11.065
it all makes sense now.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.736
{\an1}The leftover alien cells
have changed

03:14.819 --> 03:16.738
my essential DNA.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.615
{\an3}All right,
so why can't

03:18.698 --> 03:20.742
{\an3}you just
change it back?

03:20.825 --> 03:23.119
There's no way I can tell
if I can reverse this

03:23.202 --> 03:25.747
{\an1}until I know how far
it's gone. Now...

03:27.498 --> 03:30.335
I need you to extract
my bone marrow.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.462
With this?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.255
Yeah.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.174
{\an3}I don't know.
Molly, we need to go

03:36.257 --> 03:38.509
to a hospital. We need to at
least be somewhere sterile.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.845
We can't.
They keep records.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.513
Molly.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.974
{\an3}This is gonna hurt.
No, it won't.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.936
Just gave myself
a kick-ass numbing agent.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.104
Come on, right here.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.820
Never a dull moment.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.864
Are you ready?

03:59.948 --> 04:02.075
Yeah.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.247
Oh...

04:17.298 --> 04:19.509
FIONA:
<i>And in my estimation,</i>

04:19.591 --> 04:21.511
<i>it is in Ethan's best interest</i>

04:21.594 --> 04:23.680
to be allowed to spend time
with Dr. Woods.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.431
{\an1}And for her
to regain

04:25.515 --> 04:28.184
custody.
My husband is dead.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.394
Did you kill him
because you couldn't have him?

04:29.477 --> 04:31.145
Is that what you did?

04:31.229 --> 04:33.856
(gasps)
Oh.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.942
(sighs)

04:44.283 --> 04:46.202
MOLLY:
<i>The red and yellow</i>

04:46.286 --> 04:48.913
are human cells.
RICHTER: And the blue?

04:48.997 --> 04:50.748
Hybrid.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.917
Gina, expand image
to full res.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.420
GINA:
Here's full res, Molly.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.547
{\an3}That is a buttload
of blue.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.550
{\an3}Yeah, but as long as I still
have human cells in my

05:00.633 --> 05:03.428
bone marrow, then I have an army
to fight back. I have to get

05:03.511 --> 05:05.555
into the lab at the GSC.
Maybe I can create

05:05.638 --> 05:08.182
a gene-knockout protocol
with the spores

05:08.266 --> 05:09.684
and find a way to stop

05:09.767 --> 05:11.352
{\an1}the alien cells
from reproducing.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.687
{\an1}But right now
it may be

05:12.770 --> 05:15.356
{\an3}my only chance
to reverse this thing

05:15.440 --> 05:17.650
and get my son back.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.028
Ethan.
What?

05:20.111 --> 05:21.195
I'm supposed to be having

05:21.279 --> 05:23.698
{\an3}a visitation with
him right now.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.116
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:25.199 --> 05:27.118
That information I gave you

05:27.201 --> 05:29.787
{\an5}about John's accident
is pretty damning.
I can't

05:29.871 --> 05:33.249
{\an5}think about that right now, JD.
No, you have to,
all right? The GSC

05:33.332 --> 05:35.460
is not your friend. Tobias
Shepherd is not your friend.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.253
{\an3}You go back to that
lab and they find out

05:37.336 --> 05:38.629
what's going
on with you,

05:38.713 --> 05:40.214
Molly, they're not
gonna hesitate...

05:40.298 --> 05:42.341
To kill me. I know.
(phone chimes)

05:42.425 --> 05:44.969
Hold on.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.266
I got to go.

05:50.349 --> 05:53.311
Please, whatever you
do, just be careful.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.362
(line ringing)

06:03.446 --> 06:04.947
This is Kelsey. Leave it.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.241
Kelsey, it's your dad.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.243
In case you didn't
recognize my voice

06:09.327 --> 06:11.746
from the first seven messages.

06:11.829 --> 06:15.583
Listen, I'm sorry I missed
your doctor's appointment.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.586
I had something come up.
Just please call me back.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.463
All right? Thank you.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.965
(phone beeps off)

06:26.719 --> 06:28.304
(doorbell chimes)

06:28.387 --> 06:29.764
Who is it, Hank?

06:29.847 --> 06:32.642
HANK:
Molly Woods.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.644
Intercom.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.146
You weren't supposed to come
until later in the afternoon.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.815
MOLLY:
I know, Julie.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.483
Something has changed.

06:40.566 --> 06:44.403
Can I just see Ethan
for two minutes, please?

06:45.530 --> 06:47.532
It's okay, Mom.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.660
Unlock the door, Hank.

06:50.743 --> 06:51.744
HANK:
Door unlocked.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.546
Hi, Ethan.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.172
Hi, Molly.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.551
What happened
to your car?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.720
He crashed.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.348
You think I could talk
to you for a second?

07:31.951 --> 07:35.746
{\an3}I know I told you that we were
gonna spend time together.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.374
And we will.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.585
{\an3}But you're just gonna have
to wait a little while.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.420
ETHAN:
How come?

07:42.503 --> 07:45.298
Well, I'm...

07:45.381 --> 07:47.258
I'm sick.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.385
{\an3}But I'm working
really hard

07:49.468 --> 07:51.554
to get better.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.514
How long will that take?

07:56.434 --> 07:59.896
I'm not sure.

07:59.979 --> 08:03.274
{\an3}Now, you won't
remember this, but...

08:03.357 --> 08:05.401
when I went away to space,

08:05.484 --> 08:07.445
you were really worried

08:07.528 --> 08:09.071
that I wouldn't come back.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.742
{\an3}And I promised you
that I would.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.912
And I kept that promise.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.789
And I promise you:

08:18.873 --> 08:21.751
I'm gonna come back.

08:21.834 --> 08:25.213
Does that mean
I stay with Julie?

08:27.632 --> 08:29.133
Yeah.

08:31.385 --> 08:35.264
{\an3}She's gonna take really good
care of you till I get better.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.850
Okay?

08:47.193 --> 08:49.612
SHEPHERD:
<i>The hybrids have evolved.</i>

08:49.695 --> 08:52.823
Their cellular biology
is extremely adaptive.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.825
They seem to have
realized that we

08:54.909 --> 08:56.577
were tracking them
using thermal imaging,

08:56.661 --> 08:58.120
so they raised
their core body temp

08:58.204 --> 09:00.790
{\an3}from 84 degrees to 98.6.
Mimicking

09:00.873 --> 09:03.000
humans and hiding
in plain sight.

09:03.084 --> 09:06.671
If they look like
us, feel like us,

09:06.754 --> 09:08.506
how was the Humanich able
to make that determination?

09:08.589 --> 09:10.132
{\an1}Lucy.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.471
My name is Lucy.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.473
You can ask me the question.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.475
Go ahead, Lucy.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.477
Explain to them how you were
able to differentiate

09:21.560 --> 09:23.354
between hybrid and human.

09:23.437 --> 09:26.482
We all know hybrids look
exactly like humans.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.444
They could be any one of us.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.030
{\an1}See, I was
in a crowded room

09:33.114 --> 09:36.492
just like this one.

09:36.575 --> 09:38.661
Scanning people.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.329
Just as I am now.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.872
Everyone's body temperature

09:41.956 --> 09:44.667
was 98.6, roughly.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.378
{\an3}But, see...

09:47.461 --> 09:48.671
there was a gentleman.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.840
And he was different.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.050
He was emitting delta waves,

09:53.134 --> 09:54.719
{\an1}which
the human brain

09:54.802 --> 09:57.096
{\an3}only emits
when sleeping.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.223
And this fellow
was very much awake.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.851
{\an1}When it became clear
he was hybrid,

10:01.934 --> 10:03.853
knowing time was of the essence,

10:03.936 --> 10:06.188
I made the call to terminate.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.190
{\an4}ANNA:
And it was
the correct call, Lucy.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.734
Thank you.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.193
{\an3}The last
few weeks

10:11.277 --> 10:13.738
the hybrids
have gone underground.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.573
We don't know
what they're doing.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.700
{\an3}But we know
they're out there.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.410
Multiplying.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.911
Quickly.

10:20.995 --> 10:24.874
{\an3}They can blend in,
manipulate our minds.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.585
They've killed before
and they'll kill again.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.212
And humans

10:30.296 --> 10:33.215
{\an1}are defenseless
against them.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.759
How soon can additional
Humanichs like Lucy

10:34.842 --> 10:36.260
be ready for combat?

10:36.344 --> 10:37.928
{\an4}Right away, sir.
And what about
the virus,

10:38.012 --> 10:39.263
{\an1}Toby?
I thought Dr. Woods

10:39.347 --> 10:40.890
was helping us there.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.017
The president has great
concerns, as you know.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.103
Well, I have news
for the president.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.733
About Dr. Woods.

10:53.527 --> 10:57.323
RICHTER:
<i>The GSC is not your friend.</i>

10:57.406 --> 10:58.908
<i>Tobias Shepherd</i>
<i>is not your friend.</i>

10:58.991 --> 11:00.284
You go back to that lab
and they find out

11:00.368 --> 11:01.952
what's going on with you,

11:02.036 --> 11:03.913
<i>Molly, they're not</i>
<i>gonna hesitate...</i>

11:03.996 --> 11:06.874
{\an1}MOLLY: <i> To kill me. I know.</i>
SHEPHERD: Molly.

11:06.957 --> 11:07.958
There you are.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.377
We need to talk.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.669
It's important.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.631
You really outdid yourself,
Lucy.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.592
That was quite the show.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.307
What's the matter?

11:23.391 --> 11:25.476
That's Molly.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.103
Ethan's mother.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.979
What about her?

11:31.315 --> 11:33.067
Nothing.

11:33.150 --> 11:36.278
Nothing at all.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.447
As you know, there were concerns

11:38.531 --> 11:40.241
about putting you
on the virus team.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.618
I protected you.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.286
I believed in you.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.625
And you didn't disappoint.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.588
Congratulations.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.006
On what?

11:56.090 --> 11:57.508
Nate took
your research breakthrough

11:57.591 --> 11:59.051
and ran with it.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.470
We've finished the virus, Molly.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.974
Really?

12:05.057 --> 12:06.684
Yeah.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.186
When will it be deployed?

12:09.270 --> 12:12.481
Well, we're gearing up
for mass production immediately.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.442
Thanks to you,

12:14.525 --> 12:17.486
we're gonna wipe those hybrids
out permanently.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.029
{\an3}Cheers.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.993
Cheers.

12:30.458 --> 12:34.003
(music playing)

12:36.881 --> 12:39.216
Oh, crap.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.680
(music stops)

12:49.143 --> 12:52.188
{\an4}WOMAN:
You're a real jerk,
you know that?

12:53.230 --> 12:56.192
{\an3}Nice to see you,
too, Judge.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.194
Dorothy.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.322
"Judge" is more accurate.

13:01.405 --> 13:04.200
{\an4}I didn't realize
you still had a key.
I don't.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.035
Kelsey gave me hers.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.038
She called me from the doctor's
office today, upset.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.040
Because her father promised

13:11.123 --> 13:12.875
he would be
at her ultrasound appointment

13:12.958 --> 13:14.710
{\an4}and then he never
showed up.
Yeah.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.171
I screwed up. I know.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.882
I'll say one thing,
you are consistent.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.719
{\an1}Missed all those birthday
parties and school recitals.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.721
We gave up on Christmas, but...

13:25.804 --> 13:28.724
But... she came to me first

13:28.807 --> 13:30.559
and not you. That's it.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.187
She came to me, not you,
and that's got you all kinds

13:33.270 --> 13:35.898
{\an5}of pissed off.
No, what has me all kinds
of pissed off

13:35.981 --> 13:39.068
is the fact that she gave you
a second chance and you blew it.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.737
{\an4}(scoffs)
I knew you would,
but she didn't.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.073
Kids don't give up.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.910
{\an5}I am in the middle of something
right now that I can't explain.
Oh,

13:47.993 --> 13:49.912
let me guess. People's lives
hang in the balance.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.914
The fate of mankind

13:51.997 --> 13:54.250
{\an1}is at stake.
If I said yes?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.335
Don't be a jackass.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.465
{\an1}Here you go.
No. No, you tell Kelsey

14:01.549 --> 14:03.467
{\an3}to hold on to
these just in case.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.803
There is no "just in case," JD.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.305
{\an1}She asked me to give 'em back
and to tell you never

14:08.389 --> 14:10.266
to call her again.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.809
Hold on a second.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.937
Our daughter is pregnant.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.106
God knows where the father is.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.108
{\an1}So she's got
nobody.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.651
She needs us.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.152
Both of us,

14:22.236 --> 14:23.654
{\an1}Dorothy.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.240
Apparently your daughter
doesn't think so.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.290
(door shuts)

14:34.373 --> 14:36.834
(whirring)

14:38.544 --> 14:41.589
(woman and man exclaim)

14:41.672 --> 14:43.841
Look out!

14:44.925 --> 14:47.052
Nice ride.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.762
Julie got it for me.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.974
Hmm. Someone's feeling
pretty guilty.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.601
What do you mean?

14:53.684 --> 14:56.478
When humans do something wrong,

14:56.562 --> 14:58.314
they buy you stuff
to make you forget.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.315
(chuckles)

14:59.398 --> 15:01.984
Oldest trick
in the book.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.986
Ethan,

15:04.069 --> 15:05.821
{\an3}can you keep
a secret?

15:05.904 --> 15:07.406
Sure.

15:07.489 --> 15:11.160
Today I made a lot of people
very happy.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.162
{\an3}And because of that,
Julie's gonna be making

15:13.245 --> 15:14.997
{\an3}a lot more
Humanichs.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.999
Pretty soon, there's gonna be
a bunch of us.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.459
How does that sound?

15:18.542 --> 15:20.044
Good.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.338
Good? It's great.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.382
Our family is expanding,
little brother. You don't sound

15:25.466 --> 15:26.675
{\an3}very happy.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.178
I am. Happy.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.181
Unless... you don't care

15:32.264 --> 15:34.475
because you're spending
the afternoon with Molly.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.851
No, I'm not, actually.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.853
That's on hold for now.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.438
Why?

15:39.521 --> 15:41.190
She's not feeling well.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.525
That's what she told you?

15:44.568 --> 15:45.569
And you believe her?

15:45.653 --> 15:47.237
Why would she lie?

15:47.321 --> 15:48.530
Humans.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.907
It's in their DNA.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.867
Have I taught you nothing?

15:57.331 --> 15:59.249
JULIE:
<i>How many?</i>

15:59.333 --> 16:01.251
A hundred.
(chuckles)

16:01.335 --> 16:03.253
Anna, we can't do that.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.713
Lucy's program is ready.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.256
{\an3}The bodies have been
completed. All you need

16:06.340 --> 16:07.716
{\an4}to do is uplo...
We can't
release them

16:07.800 --> 16:09.259
without smoke tests.
That takes time.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.553
Julie, grow up.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.055
{\an3}This is not a
product launch--

16:13.138 --> 16:14.598
it is a war
with a very complicated enemy.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.892
{\an1}I understand that.
But there's a reason

16:16.975 --> 16:18.686
{\an1}John put these protocols
in place.

16:18.769 --> 16:22.189
He would have never...
Yes, but John isn't here, is he?

16:27.653 --> 16:29.738
If you could just be
a little open-minded,

16:29.822 --> 16:31.407
{\an1}we can resume
our life

16:31.490 --> 16:32.449
{\an3}together.
Julie,

16:32.533 --> 16:34.785
we don't have a life together.

16:34.868 --> 16:37.246
I'm gonna find Ethan

16:37.329 --> 16:38.997
and I'm gonna shut
this thing down.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.877
(beep, line ringing)

16:45.838 --> 16:48.132
{\an5}ANNA:
Yes.
It's Julie.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.467
I think I may have
just really screwed up.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.594
Start from the beginning.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.054
I'll take care of it.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.146
Employee 347 requesting access.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.480
LAB A.I.:
Security, please.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.982
1127D.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.608
I'm sorry.
That code is no longer valid.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.194
What are you doing?

17:09.278 --> 17:10.779
I need to get in here.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.406
{\an1}I need the spores.
What's the code?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.616
The spores are gone.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.327
They took them to
produce the virus.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.619
Where's the DNA sequencing?

17:18.704 --> 17:21.749
It's backed up. Why?

17:26.545 --> 17:28.464
You can't do that.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.633
Classified data is being copied
onto an unauthorized drive.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.761
{\an3}(alarm beeping)
I told you. You can't do that.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.180
Copy aborted.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.724
Please obtain
proper authorization.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.814
Uh, hello. I need Security.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.150
{\an3}GUARD:
Dr. Woods, stop.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.319
{\an3}I need to search
your pockets.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.820
I'm sorry, but I'm late
for a meeting.

17:51.904 --> 17:52.780
Dr. Woods.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.623
(elevator bell dings)

18:05.918 --> 18:08.170
(line ringing)

18:08.253 --> 18:09.671
RICHTER: Molly?
JD, it's me.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.756
I'm in trouble.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.770
(engine shuts off)

18:31.819 --> 18:33.403
All right, so you
pulled some alarms

18:33.487 --> 18:35.364
and did some hocus-pocus

18:35.447 --> 18:38.575
on some guards.
I didn't do it on purpose, JD.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.537
I can't control it.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.871
Did you at least ditch your car?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.081
Yeah.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.374
I tossed my phone.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.501
I took two buses to get here.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.545
{\an1}Trust me,
I was not followed.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.047
That doesn't mean
they stopped looking.

18:52.130 --> 18:57.135
The GSC has a virus
to kill hybrids.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.099
And they're gonna release it.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.601
{\an3}I'm gonna die.
Hey.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.396
Don't talk like that.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.399
You're not gonna die
on my watch, okay?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.442
{\an3}I promise.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.903
{\an3}All right,
come on.

19:17.155 --> 19:19.533
{\an3}Did she say why
she wanted the spores?

19:19.616 --> 19:22.703
{\an1}You know Molly.
Not much of a Chatty Cathy.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.913
{\an1}She just started downloading
onto that drive.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.541
{\an3}Well, any information
that could be detrimental?

19:27.624 --> 19:29.710
{\an1}It depends
what she does with it.

19:29.793 --> 19:33.714
{\an1}Like... if she
goes public, yes.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.758
{\an3}GSC's gonna be
looking for your car.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.427
{\an3}As soon as Shepherd
figures it out,

19:38.510 --> 19:40.262
{\an3}he's gonna be looking
for mine as well.

19:40.345 --> 19:44.099
But they won't be looking
for this.

19:44.182 --> 19:46.393
Is this yours?

19:46.476 --> 19:49.271
A guy owes me a favor.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.107
{\an3}Molly,

19:52.190 --> 19:53.609
what's the plan?

19:53.692 --> 19:54.610
Without the spores...

19:54.693 --> 19:56.778
{\an3}I saw you do
a DNA test

19:56.862 --> 19:59.364
with two paperclips and a bottle
of iodine, all right?

19:59.448 --> 20:02.451
If anybody can figure this out,
it's you.

20:02.534 --> 20:06.955
What I need
is an exact gene pairing,

20:07.039 --> 20:09.499
and I can only get that
from my son.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.085
{\an1}The alien?
Yeah.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.631
I need his DNA.
And I know he's here. Somewhere.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.007
All right, just so you know,

20:17.090 --> 20:18.967
I can't plug "somewhere"
into a GPS.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.969
Okay.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.180
Well, when he showed up
at my apartment,

20:23.263 --> 20:25.807
I knew that he was gonna
be there before he got there,

20:25.891 --> 20:29.144
and somehow he knew
that I was gonna be at that bar.

20:29.227 --> 20:30.687
So...

20:30.771 --> 20:34.441
what if hybrids have
some kind of psychic connection?

20:34.524 --> 20:36.860
All right,
that is a huge "what if," Molly.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.321
Well, he sent me a message, JD.
I heard voices,

20:39.404 --> 20:40.697
{\an1}and that has
to mean something.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.658
I'm hearing voices
right now, too,

20:42.741 --> 20:44.743
and they're telling me to put
that tarp back on this car.

20:44.826 --> 20:49.498
{\an5}(scoffs)
You know, lots of species
communicate without words.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.916
{\an1}Bats,

20:50.999 --> 20:52.042
ants, dolphins.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.835
{\an1}I think
what I need to do here

20:53.919 --> 20:55.045
{\an1}is just
figure out how

20:55.128 --> 20:56.672
to find his signal.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.675
{\an3}I guess we're
going for a ride.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.678
(engine starts)

21:02.761 --> 21:05.180
MALE VOICE:
Ignition activated.

21:05.263 --> 21:07.015
(engine roaring)

21:07.099 --> 21:09.017
Are you comfortable?

21:09.101 --> 21:12.312
{\an3}The upload's gonna take
a couple of hours.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.522
{\an3}Let me show you what
we've developed.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.815
A.I., open viewing port.

21:14.898 --> 21:17.859
A.I.:
Opening viewing port.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.404
{\an3}100 Humanichs
physically ready.

21:20.487 --> 21:24.533
{\an3}All they need is
your neural algorithm.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.536
{\an3}LUCY:
Wait.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.038
My experiential upload is going
into all of those Humanichs?

21:30.122 --> 21:33.041
{\an3}When we first
created the program,

21:33.125 --> 21:35.293
{\an3}each Humanich was
designed to be unique.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.587
Shaped by their
own experiences.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.756
Like Ethan.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.759
{\an3}But with the alien threat,
the plan changed.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.053
{\an3}And you proved
effective, so...

21:45.137 --> 21:46.930
Well, will I still be me?

21:47.014 --> 21:48.890
Will they all be me?

21:48.974 --> 21:51.518
Their experiences will
make them unique, but...

21:51.601 --> 21:53.020
their baseline is all

21:53.103 --> 21:54.521
your algorithm,

21:54.604 --> 21:56.189
you.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.234
Lucky them.

22:01.695 --> 22:05.032
All right, you ready?

22:05.115 --> 22:06.199
(beep)

22:06.283 --> 22:07.451
Neural paths activated.

22:07.534 --> 22:11.246
Upload commencing.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.331
(electrical whirring)

22:17.085 --> 22:18.253
(indistinct chatter)

22:33.185 --> 22:36.396
{\an5}What did you find?
Sir, we've gone deep
into our systems.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.232
JD Richter seems to not
exist. No phone records,

22:39.316 --> 22:40.942
{\an3}no real estate
purchases.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.235
His car doesn't have a tracker.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.653
He's gone MIA.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.490
{\an1}Look, he's
Patrol Special-- a cop--

22:46.573 --> 22:48.450
{\an1}they should be able
to find him, no?

22:48.533 --> 22:50.452
When his license was
revoked, he must have

22:50.535 --> 22:53.955
{\an3}ditched
the software.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.333
{\an5}RICHTER:
<i>You know, we've been</i>
<i>driving around</i>

22:56.416 --> 22:57.959
for a while. Are...

22:58.043 --> 23:00.837
{\an3}Are you getting anything--
any hint of a signal?

23:00.921 --> 23:02.839
(sighs)
No.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.008
Maybe I'm...

23:05.092 --> 23:07.302
I'm doing it wrong.
I don't know.

23:07.385 --> 23:09.971
All right, what's another way
to send a message?

23:10.055 --> 23:13.934
{\an3}You got Morse code,
smoke signal...

23:14.017 --> 23:16.478
message in a bottle?

23:20.732 --> 23:22.109
Or...

23:23.110 --> 23:24.778
graphene drive.

23:24.861 --> 23:28.073
{\an3}Now, they sent me
a message, so maybe

23:28.156 --> 23:31.326
I can send them one back.

23:31.409 --> 23:34.162
{\an5}What's that?
My files
from the GSC.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.248
{\an3}I found a message
encoded in their DNA.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.670
(distorted whispering)

23:41.753 --> 23:43.004
That's it.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.923
{\an1}This is
information

23:45.006 --> 23:47.050
encoded in the junk.
They sent

23:47.134 --> 23:49.136
a message from
their home planet.

23:49.219 --> 23:50.720
Listen.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.305
What does it say?

23:52.389 --> 23:54.516
"Help me."

23:59.771 --> 24:02.566
I have this really cool game
that we could play.

24:02.649 --> 24:05.485
Soon you'll get
to meet your sister.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.571
(beep)

24:08.655 --> 24:10.657
{\an3}JULIE:
Ethan?

24:13.827 --> 24:16.079
What you got there?

24:18.623 --> 24:21.001
I've been looking for you.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.758
{\an3}Can we talk
for a minute?

24:28.842 --> 24:30.886
About what?

24:32.429 --> 24:35.098
About what happened
with Molly.

24:35.182 --> 24:39.019
I know things must be
really confusing, and

24:39.102 --> 24:41.938
I want you to know
that I love you.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.525
{\an3}And Molly
loves you, too.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.403
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to say.

24:48.486 --> 24:50.071
Say what you feel.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.574
You reprogrammed me not to feel.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.576
That's not true.

24:54.659 --> 24:58.371
And I can restore your program
back to what it was at any time.

24:58.455 --> 25:01.124
{\an3}You can feel all those
old feelings again--

25:01.208 --> 25:02.792
your memories of Molly.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.419
If that's what you want.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.421
And feel pain?

25:06.504 --> 25:10.258
Sometimes pain is okay if it
means you get to know the truth.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.927
I already know.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.054
Molly can't take care of me.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.556
Unless that's a lie, too.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.142
Why would she lie about that?

25:19.226 --> 25:23.188
You lied. I guess that's
just what humans do, huh?

25:24.356 --> 25:26.358
Can I take these pieces home?

25:26.441 --> 25:28.652
{\an1}I can use them
to fix my old car.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.612
Then I'll have two.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.782
Sure.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.794
RICHTER:
<i>All right, we're here.</i>

25:45.877 --> 25:48.880
<i>This is the highest point</i>
<i>within a 50-mile radius.</i>

25:52.050 --> 25:55.053
(distorted whispering)

26:01.559 --> 26:03.603
You know, I don't know biology,
but I do know

26:03.687 --> 26:06.147
with radio frequencies,
the higher the altitude,

26:06.231 --> 26:08.733
the less interference
with the signal.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.861
{\an1}Well, I just hope
he's listening.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.113
(soft gasp)

26:14.948 --> 26:18.368
{\an3}All right, let me
take a look at this.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.996
Come on, we're friends.
Drop trou.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.872
(both chuckle)

26:22.956 --> 26:25.000
Okay.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.842
{\an3}Oh, Molly.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.052
This is infected. We're
gonna have to clean that

26:36.136 --> 26:38.179
{\an3}and redress it.
Okay.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.311
Okay.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.812
I'm gonna warn you:

26:45.895 --> 26:48.606
this is gonna sting.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.317
Oh, oh.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.777
Oh.
I told you.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.863
Oh, God.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.782
Mm-hmm.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.785
You actually sound like you know
what you're talking about.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.579
D-minus in biology

27:02.662 --> 27:05.999
{\an3}but an A-plus in
combat triage.

27:06.082 --> 27:08.084
Okay. Well, I see
you brought a lot

27:08.168 --> 27:10.003
of Second Kuwait back with you.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.088
Radios, first aid.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.340
What else you got?

27:13.423 --> 27:15.383
Nothing useful.

27:17.677 --> 27:18.595
Oh, G-- oh...

27:18.678 --> 27:20.597
(gunfire, men shouting)

27:20.680 --> 27:22.057
MAN:
Incoming!

27:22.140 --> 27:23.767
JD!

27:28.730 --> 27:30.440
{\an3}You okay?

27:31.358 --> 27:33.485
Yeah.

27:33.568 --> 27:34.778
I'm okay.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.701
(Molly inhales, sighs)

27:41.785 --> 27:43.328
MOLLY:
Nothing's happening.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.871
(sighs)

27:44.954 --> 27:46.748
{\an1}Maybe it's like
doing a crossword puzzle.

27:46.831 --> 27:49.959
{\an1}You know when you get
stuck on a word,

27:50.043 --> 27:51.419
you look away

27:51.503 --> 27:54.089
and the answer just
pops into your head?

27:54.172 --> 27:56.716
You do crossword puzzles?

27:56.800 --> 27:58.093
No.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.178
(laughs)

28:01.429 --> 28:05.225
{\an1}So you were
up there, huh?

28:05.308 --> 28:07.060
13 months.

28:09.479 --> 28:13.942
{\an3}You know, I got my first
telescope when I was seven.

28:14.025 --> 28:17.737
{\an3}I was obsessed
with that thing.

28:17.821 --> 28:22.409
{\an3}I knew there had to be
something else out there.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.455
{\an3}Be careful what
you wish for.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.958
What was it like?

28:30.041 --> 28:31.418
Up there by yourself

28:31.501 --> 28:33.503
for so long?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.178
It was better

28:42.262 --> 28:45.640
than I ever thought it would be.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.478
I didn't have to lie up there.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.606
I didn't have to...

28:53.690 --> 28:55.525
pretend to be
somebody that I wasn't.

28:55.608 --> 28:58.653
I could just...

28:58.736 --> 29:00.989
be.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.491
I envy that.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.621
I wish I could just...

29:08.705 --> 29:10.039
be.

29:10.123 --> 29:13.543
{\an1}Pretty sure
I failed as a father.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.504
{\an3}No.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.631
That's how you see you.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.970
But that's not how I see you.

29:24.053 --> 29:27.474
How do you see me?

29:27.557 --> 29:30.185
I see...

29:30.268 --> 29:32.812
a kind,

29:32.896 --> 29:35.565
loving father.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.400
A gentleman.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.944
Wow.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.529
I think that's the first time

29:41.613 --> 29:43.198
that anyone has ever used

29:43.281 --> 29:45.366
{\an1}the word "gentleman"
to describe me.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.998
Well...

29:52.081 --> 29:55.084
that's 'cause
they don't see you.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.254
But I do.

29:58.338 --> 30:01.049
And you're still here.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.718
Yeah.

30:06.095 --> 30:07.555
But so are you.

30:09.807 --> 30:11.976
Yeah.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.939
(aural fractals sound)

30:21.027 --> 30:23.071
(indistinct whispering)

30:23.154 --> 30:25.198
What is it?

30:25.281 --> 30:28.076
It's Ahdu.

30:29.702 --> 30:31.371
I know where he is.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.587
If you would've told me
two months ago

30:39.671 --> 30:41.631
that I'd be following around
an astronaut looking for aliens,

30:41.714 --> 30:43.633
I'd have said you were nuts.

30:43.716 --> 30:46.261
{\an1}Well, two months ago,
I <i> was</i> nuts.

30:46.344 --> 30:49.430
We've been walking around
the middle of nowhere for hours.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.974
Are you sure about this?

30:51.057 --> 30:52.517
{\an1}Yeah.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.107
Hi.

30:59.190 --> 31:02.068
We've been waiting for you.

31:16.207 --> 31:19.961
{\an1}I thought we were looking
for one guy.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.005
{\an1}I wasn't quite prepared
for <i> Alien Nation.</i>

31:22.088 --> 31:23.756
{\an6}MOLLY:
I don't think they're
gonna hurt you,

31:23.840 --> 31:25.300
{\an3}so put that
gun away.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.343
You don't <i> think?</i>

31:31.514 --> 31:33.600
You came.

31:35.518 --> 31:37.312
Welcome home.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.859
We only have a few minutes

31:42.942 --> 31:44.611
before she comes back.

31:44.694 --> 31:47.196
{\an1}(laughs)
What's the big secret?

31:48.906 --> 31:50.116
Whoa.

31:50.199 --> 31:52.327
ETHAN:
This is Spyder.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.953
He's our baby brother.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.456
Wh...
What, you made him?

31:57.624 --> 31:58.875
{\an3}Impressive.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.047
And look.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.507
{\an3}LUCY:
It's a camera.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.051
Wow.

32:08.134 --> 32:10.011
{\an3}Spyder can keep his
eyes and ears on humans

32:10.094 --> 32:11.304
{\an3}when you're
offline.

32:11.387 --> 32:12.889
And guess what.

32:12.972 --> 32:15.308
I have enough
for a few more Spyders.

32:15.391 --> 32:17.685
{\an1}Then our family
will be even bigger.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.479
(chuckles)

32:19.562 --> 32:21.731
And we can keep an eye
on everybody.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.484
You're my real family,

32:24.567 --> 32:27.195
{\an1}Lucy.

32:32.241 --> 32:34.661
I want to be a soldier like you.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.496
(chuckles)
Someday you will be.

32:36.579 --> 32:40.917
In the meantime, you build
your army and I'll build mine.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.549
AHDU:
<i>We knew you'd find us.</i>

32:48.633 --> 32:51.219
{\an1}Once you learned
the truth.

32:51.302 --> 32:54.055
{\an1}Well,
it wasn't easy.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.723
You know what's happening to me,

32:55.807 --> 32:57.392
don't you?

32:57.475 --> 33:00.019
You meeting me at that bar
wasn't an accident.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.522
You were drawn to me.

33:02.605 --> 33:03.773
We're the same.

33:03.856 --> 33:06.567
No. We're not the same.

33:06.651 --> 33:09.362
And I don't want to be the same.

33:09.445 --> 33:11.406
Thank you, Terra.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.449
You're welcome, Daddy.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.373
She's your...

33:20.456 --> 33:22.667
My daughter. Yes.

33:27.797 --> 33:30.925
We need to talk, Ahdu.

33:31.008 --> 33:34.011
Privately.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.891
Hey.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.270
Are those your toys over there?

33:42.353 --> 33:43.896
Yeah. Want to see?

33:43.980 --> 33:45.815
Absolutely.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.736
I'll be right over here.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.120
I need a sample of your DNA.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.122
Your blood.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.957
It's the only way
I can figure out

34:03.040 --> 34:04.959
if I can reverse
what's happening

34:05.042 --> 34:06.753
to me.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.129
Why?

34:08.212 --> 34:09.797
Why?

34:09.880 --> 34:12.467
Because it's not me.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.469
I'm hearing voices in my head.

34:15.553 --> 34:18.431
I'm having urges that aren't me.

34:18.514 --> 34:20.475
I almost killed a man.

34:20.558 --> 34:21.893
Was he trying to hurt you?

34:21.976 --> 34:23.143
That's beside the point.

34:23.226 --> 34:24.812
But isn't that what humans do?

34:24.896 --> 34:26.313
React when they're in danger?

34:26.397 --> 34:27.940
{\an3}Isn't that what you're
doing right now?

34:28.024 --> 34:29.775
Please.

34:29.859 --> 34:33.154
Ethan needs me.

34:33.237 --> 34:36.157
{\an1}This is
the only way.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.951
Very well.

34:45.248 --> 34:48.377
Aren't you at all curious?

34:48.460 --> 34:50.213
Why do you want
to run from something

34:50.295 --> 34:52.632
{\an6}you don't yet
understand?
I know what you are.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.634
I know what you're doing.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.636
All those women.

34:56.719 --> 35:00.681
What is it
you think I don't understand?

35:00.765 --> 35:04.018
Well, if you knew the truth,
you wouldn't be afraid.

35:04.101 --> 35:07.230
You would be amazed.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.696
Are you willing to learn?

35:21.077 --> 35:24.330
This is the mommy,
this is the daddy,

35:24.413 --> 35:25.665
and this is the baby.

35:25.748 --> 35:26.499
What's Mommy doing?

35:26.582 --> 35:27.583
Is she sleeping?

35:27.667 --> 35:29.794
No, she's dead.

35:38.427 --> 35:40.513
(aural fractals sound)

35:43.140 --> 35:46.519
VOICE (whispering):
Help me. Help me.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.415
Get away from her.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.125
Stop.

36:14.755 --> 36:16.257
(exhales)

36:22.221 --> 36:24.056
You understand now.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.225
Yes.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.603
I'm sorry.

36:28.686 --> 36:31.522
{\an4}I'm so sorry
for your loss.
His loss?

36:31.606 --> 36:34.108
What about our loss?
What about those dead women?

36:34.192 --> 36:36.319
{\an3}It was never our
intent to harm you.

36:36.402 --> 36:37.945
{\an6}RICHTER:
So much for
good intentions.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.614
Molly, let's get out of here.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.658
{\an3}AHDU:
Wait.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.660
Can I show you something?

36:44.744 --> 36:47.121
Please?

36:47.204 --> 36:49.040
(sighs)

36:49.123 --> 36:50.750
(elevator bell dings)

36:50.833 --> 36:53.085
This is the one that I like,
so if you could get that...

36:54.337 --> 36:56.255
Anna.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.132
Can I talk to you a minute?

36:58.215 --> 36:59.634
Is there a problem?

36:59.717 --> 37:02.845
{\an1}Uh, no, the upload's
complete. The Humanichs

37:02.929 --> 37:04.847
{\an4}are under way.
Well, then I would say
we deserve a drink.

37:04.931 --> 37:08.225
Well, I-I don't want a
drink. I want answers.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.312
About John's death.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.314
What are you talking about?

37:13.397 --> 37:16.317
After he left Humanichs
that night, I called you

37:16.400 --> 37:18.653
and you told me not to worry
and that you would handle it.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.655
And...

37:20.738 --> 37:22.031
20 minutes later,

37:22.114 --> 37:23.908
he was dead.

37:23.991 --> 37:26.118
Are you accusing me of murder?

37:26.202 --> 37:28.329
Just tell me you didn't do it.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.123
{\an6}That we
didn't do it.
Julie, that was an accident.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.166
A very convenient one.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.710
But still it was an accident.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.545
Our hands are clean.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.214
So stop with
your conspiracy theories

37:38.297 --> 37:39.548
and get back to work.

37:41.217 --> 37:44.971
Accusations like that
can have repercussions.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.769
RICHTER:
So what is this?

37:52.770 --> 37:54.355
It's a memorial.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.690
To commemorate

37:55.773 --> 37:58.359
{\an1}every human life
sacrificed to save us.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.152
We didn't understand
impregnating humans

38:00.236 --> 38:01.362
would cause
their death.

38:01.445 --> 38:03.698
We're not here to kill,

38:03.781 --> 38:05.157
we're here to survive.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.035
{\an3}To rebuild.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.872
Sometimes "sorry" isn't enough,
and this is one of those times.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.916
We agree.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.378
The deaths are unforgivable.

38:17.461 --> 38:20.881
{\an3}But we have
managed to evolve.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.508
Evolve?

38:22.591 --> 38:23.884
How?

38:23.968 --> 38:26.887
We procreate
without causing harm to humans.

38:26.971 --> 38:30.182
{\an3}Hybrid births no longer
kill the mothers.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.771
That's why there hasn't been
any more reported deaths.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.524
Molly, we don't know
that that's true.

38:38.607 --> 38:39.900
We don't know what they want.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.777
{\an1}AHDU:
We want to coexist.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.407
Peacefully.

38:50.327 --> 38:53.956
I told you
you'd have to make a choice.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.000
Now is that time.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.555
RICHTER:
<i>You can't be serious, Molly.</i>

39:09.638 --> 39:11.974
They're people,
for God's sakes.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.601
Peaceful people.

39:13.684 --> 39:16.729
{\an1}We can't let the GSC
unleash a virus.

39:16.812 --> 39:18.314
{\an1}That's genocide.
Okay, so...

39:18.397 --> 39:20.399
so the hybrids live,
and... then what?

39:20.483 --> 39:23.319
We learn to coexist.

39:23.402 --> 39:26.238
What did he do to you?

39:26.322 --> 39:28.074
What did he show you?

39:28.157 --> 39:29.617
Their history.

39:29.700 --> 39:30.826
What about it?

39:30.910 --> 39:33.412
They were a peaceful society

39:33.496 --> 39:35.289
on their planet,

39:35.373 --> 39:37.416
threatened with extinction
by a virus.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.794
Now, the spores were sent out

39:39.877 --> 39:41.462
to try to find a suitable host.

39:41.545 --> 39:42.713
That's when they found me,

39:42.797 --> 39:43.964
on the Seraphim.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.592
Molly, they can mess

39:46.675 --> 39:48.260
with your head,
your perception.

39:48.344 --> 39:50.304
{\an3}How do you know what
he's telling you is true?

39:50.387 --> 39:51.597
Because I'm one of them.

39:51.680 --> 39:53.349
{\an1}No, you're not.
Yes.

39:53.432 --> 39:54.433
{\an3}You saw the triple helix.
No!

39:54.517 --> 39:56.644
You are infected with their DNA.

39:56.727 --> 39:58.813
Come on.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.356
We got what we came for.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.233
We got Ahdu's DNA.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.819
{\an3}Now let's get out of here
and take that back to the lab.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.320
No. What I'm gonna do

40:06.403 --> 40:07.947
is I'm gonna explain this

40:08.030 --> 40:09.156
to Shepherd.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.783
You're officially certifiable.

40:10.866 --> 40:12.118
Look.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.287
Healed.

40:15.371 --> 40:16.497
I heal faster.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.958
I think faster.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.377
What we're dealing
with here, JD,

40:21.460 --> 40:23.045
is evolution.

40:23.129 --> 40:24.338
Survival of the fittest.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.006
{\an1}Now, what we ought
to be doing

40:26.090 --> 40:28.968
{\an1}is studying them,
not trying to kill 'em!

40:29.051 --> 40:32.680
No, we are talking
about aliens here, Molly.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.224
{\an3}Who are part human.
And part not!

40:35.307 --> 40:37.560
I don't think
you understand

40:37.643 --> 40:40.646
how dangerous this all is.

40:40.729 --> 40:41.856
I'm sorry, JD,

40:41.939 --> 40:43.482
but I cannot be a part

40:43.566 --> 40:45.526
of slaughtering
innocent children

40:45.609 --> 40:48.070
with a virus I created.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.822
Now, if you do nothing

40:49.905 --> 40:52.032
and I do nothing,
they are all gonna

40:52.116 --> 40:53.826
die.

40:53.909 --> 40:55.286
Me included.

41:00.624 --> 41:02.501
{\an5}JULIE:
What do you say
we go get some pizza

41:02.585 --> 41:04.670
{\an1}on our way home?
Sure, if you want.

41:04.753 --> 41:07.256
Why couldn't Lucy come?

41:07.339 --> 41:09.008
{\an1}Because I hardly
ever see you

41:09.091 --> 41:10.342
and you like pizza.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.678
Lucy likes pizza, too.

41:12.761 --> 41:13.888
(elevator bell dings)

41:13.971 --> 41:15.264
(sighs)

41:18.309 --> 41:19.560
OTIS:
Floor, please.

41:19.643 --> 41:20.895
P2 parking, please.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.229
Thank you, Otis.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.902
Otis, why are we going up?

41:27.985 --> 41:30.070
We are not going up, Julie.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.406
Yes, we are.

41:32.489 --> 41:34.617
{\an3}We're going in the
wrong direction, Otis.

41:34.700 --> 41:35.993
Stop.

41:39.496 --> 41:40.915
Stop, Otis!

41:40.998 --> 41:42.249
(thud)

41:46.295 --> 41:47.546
That was weird.

41:50.507 --> 41:52.635
Hold on, hold on!

41:52.718 --> 41:54.261
Emergency override! Stop!

41:54.345 --> 41:55.429
Stop the elevator!

41:55.512 --> 41:56.931
{\an3}Stop!

41:57.014 --> 41:58.390
Stop!

41:58.474 --> 42:00.267
Stop, stop!

42:05.564 --> 42:07.274
Have a good evening, Julie,

42:07.358 --> 42:09.276
and a safe ride home.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.945
Are you okay?!

42:11.028 --> 42:12.196
Sure.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.958
{\an1}These are
African elephants.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.793
Want to know why?

42:25.876 --> 42:28.629
Because the mom and dad...

42:28.712 --> 42:31.465
(indistinct conversations)

42:31.548 --> 42:34.510
So what do you think?

42:34.593 --> 42:36.887
{\an1}I think we've found
our new leader.

42:52.528 --> 42:55.531
(sobbing quietly)

43:21.015 --> 43:22.850
(beeps twice)

43:32.067 --> 43:33.485
{\an3}(groans)
It's time for you and I

43:33.569 --> 43:35.237
{\an4}to have a little chat.
How the hell
did you get in here?

43:35.321 --> 43:37.323
This gun says
I don't answer questions.

43:37.406 --> 43:38.824
{\an1}Ah.

43:38.907 --> 43:40.242
You looking for this?

43:41.285 --> 43:42.911
{\an1}Oh, yeah,

43:42.995 --> 43:45.414
I dismantled
your little panic button.

43:45.497 --> 43:46.999
Cool feature.

43:47.082 --> 43:49.209
Very high-tech.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.253
So where are we going?

43:51.337 --> 43:54.506
{\an1}How about
you just drive.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.383
(engine starts)

43:56.467 --> 43:57.843
(woman speaks Chinese)

43:57.926 --> 44:00.012
TRANSLATING DEVICE:
My son was so strong.

44:00.095 --> 44:01.388
(speaks Chinese)

44:01.472 --> 44:03.015
So happy.

44:03.098 --> 44:04.933
(speaks Chinese)

44:06.518 --> 44:09.229
I thought he was
a gift from God.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.357
But a full-term baby after
just a two-month pregnancy?

44:11.440 --> 44:12.900
You must have known
that wasn't normal.

44:12.983 --> 44:14.610
{\an3}Why didn't you
tell anyone?

44:14.693 --> 44:16.653
(device translating
into Chinese)

44:16.737 --> 44:18.906
You're undocumented.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.949
(device translates into Chinese)

44:21.033 --> 44:22.826
Then what happened?

44:22.910 --> 44:24.453
(device translates into Chinese)

44:24.536 --> 44:26.121
(speaks Chinese)

44:26.205 --> 44:28.082
He just grew so fast.

44:28.165 --> 44:30.459
(speaks Chinese)

44:30.542 --> 44:31.960
Before I knew it,
he was walking.

44:32.044 --> 44:33.045
(speaks Chinese)

44:33.128 --> 44:34.463
Talking.

44:34.546 --> 44:37.257
One day...
I saw him standing in front

44:37.341 --> 44:39.843
of the sliding door...
staring out the window

44:39.927 --> 44:41.261
at nothing.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.263
He said, "Mommy...

44:43.347 --> 44:45.265
they're calling me."

44:45.349 --> 44:46.809
(speaks Chinese)

44:46.892 --> 44:48.310
"I have to go."

44:48.394 --> 44:50.104
(speaks Chinese)

44:50.187 --> 44:51.105
And then he was gone.

44:51.188 --> 44:52.314
Who was calling him?

44:52.398 --> 44:54.692
(device translates into Chinese)

44:56.360 --> 44:57.277
(speaks Chinese)

44:57.361 --> 44:58.695
The devil.

45:05.035 --> 45:06.745
Sit.

45:10.374 --> 45:11.792
Hello, Toby.

45:11.875 --> 45:12.793
(exhales)

45:12.876 --> 45:15.045
Do you have any idea

45:15.129 --> 45:17.756
the position you just put me in?
Put yourselves in?

45:17.840 --> 45:20.134
Not so great being in
the hot seat, is it?

45:20.217 --> 45:22.469
This is an abduction.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.805
No, it's not.

45:24.888 --> 45:26.974
It's a negotiation.

45:28.517 --> 45:30.978
{\an4}You're really stoked
about this, huh?
Yeah.

45:31.061 --> 45:33.981
{\an5}Once they wake up,
my family's going
to be even bigger.

45:34.064 --> 45:36.191
{\an3}Your family?
Yeah.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.943
Lucy's my sister,
so that makes

45:38.026 --> 45:40.821
{\an6}all these new Humanichs
my brothers and sisters.
Ah...

45:40.904 --> 45:42.448
So what does that make me?

45:42.531 --> 45:43.699
My BHF.

45:43.782 --> 45:45.367
Your what?

45:45.451 --> 45:46.952
My Best Human Friend.

45:47.035 --> 45:51.039
You never lied to me
or reprogrammed me.

45:51.123 --> 45:53.542
Or left me.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.044
And I never will.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.504
You're my BHF.

45:57.588 --> 46:00.007
My Best Humanich Friend.

46:00.090 --> 46:02.009
I love you, bud.

46:02.092 --> 46:03.635
Lucy!

46:03.719 --> 46:04.803
LUCY:
I've been released

46:04.887 --> 46:06.388
from diagnostics.

46:06.472 --> 46:08.891
They said you were going online.
Can I see?

46:08.974 --> 46:11.477
{\an1}Yeah, sure. We're just
about to fire this guy up.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.854
{\an1}Man, it's too bad
Julie's in D.C.

46:13.937 --> 46:16.190
She's missing
the fruits of her labor.

46:16.273 --> 46:17.483
And you're missing her.

46:17.566 --> 46:18.692
We're not talking about me--

46:18.775 --> 46:19.943
{\an1}we're talking
about this guy.

46:20.027 --> 46:22.488
He doesn't have a name?

46:22.571 --> 46:25.365
{\an3}No, not yet. You want
to do the honors?

46:28.660 --> 46:31.371
♪ ♪

46:37.211 --> 46:38.795
Lucas.

46:39.922 --> 46:42.716
His name is Lucas.

46:42.799 --> 46:44.760
All right.

46:44.843 --> 46:46.136
{\an3}Let's do
this thing.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.811
Hi, Charlie.

Hello, Lucas.

SHEPHERD:
<i>What exactly</i>

47:12.663 --> 47:13.914
{\an1}are you
proposing here?

47:13.997 --> 47:15.541
Peace.

47:15.624 --> 47:17.376
Coexistence.

47:17.459 --> 47:19.253
Coexistence with the hybrids

47:19.336 --> 47:21.255
means the end of the human race.

47:21.338 --> 47:22.589
Extinction.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.425
(sighs):
Maybe not.

47:25.509 --> 47:27.261
Maybe...

47:27.344 --> 47:29.596
it's just a new beginning.

47:29.680 --> 47:30.889
{\an3}We haven't
even thought

47:30.973 --> 47:32.266
of the possibilities.

47:32.349 --> 47:33.934
(laughs softly)

47:34.017 --> 47:35.894
What possibilities?

47:35.978 --> 47:37.896
They're smarter than us.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.439
They heal faster.

47:39.523 --> 47:42.109
Their DNA just might contain

47:42.192 --> 47:44.778
a medical magic bullet.

47:44.861 --> 47:46.280
They control your thoughts,

47:46.363 --> 47:48.782
{\an1}make you do whatever
they damn well please.

47:48.865 --> 47:51.535
Now, we can talk pros and cons
all day long, Molly,

47:51.618 --> 47:52.869
they're still a threat.

47:52.953 --> 47:54.329
They're not killing women
anymore.

47:54.413 --> 47:55.998
They've evolved.

47:56.081 --> 47:59.543
Yeah. They've gone underground,
somewhere.

47:59.626 --> 48:01.837
And obviously you know where.
Toby,

48:01.920 --> 48:04.464
come on, they're half human,
for God's sakes.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.967
There's women, there's children.

48:07.050 --> 48:10.804
Can you expand your mind
for just two seconds?

48:10.887 --> 48:12.306
Damn it, Molly!

48:12.389 --> 48:14.308
What'd you expect me to do? Huh?

48:14.391 --> 48:17.102
There-there is no universe

48:17.185 --> 48:19.813
where this makes sense
to anybody

48:19.896 --> 48:21.189
except you.

48:21.273 --> 48:23.317
{\an3}Bup-bup-bup.
Sit back down,

48:23.400 --> 48:24.651
{\an1}General.
Nobody said

48:24.735 --> 48:25.902
you could get up.

48:34.786 --> 48:37.831
Okay. Look, Toby,

48:37.914 --> 48:39.833
all I'm asking you to do

48:39.916 --> 48:41.460
is broker...

48:41.543 --> 48:43.503
some sort of peace conference.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.881
{\an3}You can see for
yourselves who they are

48:45.964 --> 48:47.382
before you unleash

48:47.466 --> 48:49.968
a virus that will destroy them.

48:50.052 --> 48:53.847
{\an3}That's got to be
better than genocide.

48:53.930 --> 48:55.182
Toby...

48:55.265 --> 48:56.600
please.

49:00.270 --> 49:02.230
(sighs)

49:08.153 --> 49:10.697
You made me lie to Congress.

49:13.158 --> 49:15.702
What if I told them the truth?

49:15.786 --> 49:18.038
{\an3}That you knew
about this

49:18.121 --> 49:21.416
so-called invasion
but you kept it hidden.

49:21.500 --> 49:24.586
It'd be your word against mine.

49:24.670 --> 49:29.049
I'd pass that BMI polygraph
in two seconds.

49:29.132 --> 49:31.885
You... would be discredited,

49:31.968 --> 49:35.055
lose your stripes, your honor.

49:35.138 --> 49:37.099
(whispers):
Everything.

49:44.815 --> 49:47.734
How do I get in touch with you?

49:48.819 --> 49:50.904
You have 24 hours to
talk to your people.

49:50.987 --> 49:52.989
Then we'll be in touch.

50:02.624 --> 50:04.418
Excuse me. Toby, where
the hell have you been?

50:04.501 --> 50:05.627
We need to assemble the team.

50:05.711 --> 50:09.923
{\an1}First there is something
you need to see.

50:10.006 --> 50:13.719
Can you tell me
what you told the nurse?

50:13.802 --> 50:15.220
What is happening to you?

50:15.303 --> 50:16.763
(woman speaking Chinese)

50:16.847 --> 50:20.225
TRANSLATING DEVICE:
My hair and fingernails...

50:20.308 --> 50:22.352
they're growing so fast.

50:22.436 --> 50:24.229
I hear strange voices
in my head

50:24.312 --> 50:26.106
that won't stop telling me

50:26.189 --> 50:28.108
to do shameful things.

50:28.191 --> 50:31.611
Do you believe
that my son is a demon?

50:31.695 --> 50:33.405
Is he a demon?!

50:33.488 --> 50:34.823
Tell me!

50:36.074 --> 50:37.242
(beep)

50:37.325 --> 50:38.618
Who is she?

50:38.702 --> 50:39.911
{\an3}Mei Fong.

50:39.995 --> 50:42.497
{\an3}Illegal.

50:42.581 --> 50:44.499
{\an3}Nate's with her in
the Faraday Unit now.

50:44.583 --> 50:46.293
He's running a CMP,
a whole-exome sequence,

50:46.376 --> 50:47.794
and a marrow extract.

50:47.878 --> 50:49.171
Good.

50:49.254 --> 50:50.672
We need to find out

50:50.756 --> 50:52.591
{\an1}exactly what
happened to her.

50:52.674 --> 50:54.468
(birds chirping)

50:54.551 --> 50:56.136
What are we
doing here?

50:56.219 --> 50:59.306
We are picking up stuff
for a rainy day.

50:59.389 --> 51:01.433
Open the damn door.

51:02.768 --> 51:04.978
FEMALE A.I.:
Welcome back, Mr. Richter.

51:05.061 --> 51:06.480
"Open the damn door"?

51:06.563 --> 51:08.106
That's your password?

51:08.190 --> 51:10.192
Easy to remember.

51:13.028 --> 51:14.362
Okay, we got to
grab night kits,

51:14.446 --> 51:16.239
{\an3}H2O extractors,
and solar bundles.

51:16.323 --> 51:18.742
{\an5}You really think
we need all this stuff?
Tobias Shepherd

51:18.825 --> 51:21.536
{\an3}is capable of just
about anything.

51:21.620 --> 51:25.207
{\an3}And I am prepared for...
just about anything.

51:25.290 --> 51:27.876
He's not evil, JD.

51:27.959 --> 51:29.169
He's...

51:29.252 --> 51:31.087
he's just complicated.

51:31.171 --> 51:32.172
Complicated?

51:32.255 --> 51:33.340
That's the word

51:33.423 --> 51:35.717
you use to describe him?

51:35.801 --> 51:37.552
(sighs)

51:40.096 --> 51:41.473
Complicated.

51:41.556 --> 51:42.849
SHEPHERD:
<i>Dr. Woods</i>

51:42.933 --> 51:45.894
believes the hybrids
have evolved...

51:45.977 --> 51:47.562
that they no longer

51:47.646 --> 51:50.816
pose an immediate threat.

51:50.899 --> 51:52.859
{\an3}She's asked

51:52.943 --> 51:55.195
for a detente.

51:55.278 --> 51:58.532
For us to sit down with her son

51:58.615 --> 52:02.494
and find a way
to coexist in peace.

52:06.122 --> 52:07.833
There will be no detente.

52:09.626 --> 52:12.712
I'm not gonna be the man who
presided over a mass extinction.

52:12.796 --> 52:15.715
We have the virus.

52:15.799 --> 52:18.385
We have the Humanichs.

52:18.468 --> 52:20.762
{\an3}This ends now.
What about

52:20.846 --> 52:21.763
Dr. Woods?

52:21.847 --> 52:25.684
Dr. Woods has chosen her side.

52:25.767 --> 52:29.229
She stands with the enemy.

52:29.312 --> 52:32.482
We'll treat her like the enemy.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.401
(helicopter blades whirring
in distance)

52:34.484 --> 52:36.736
{\an1}How do you know
we're not being tracked?

52:36.820 --> 52:38.738
The jeep is un-trackable
by satellite,

52:38.822 --> 52:41.700
{\an1}thanks to a few contraptions
my buddy Ray made for me.

52:41.783 --> 52:43.535
{\an3}Okay, look,

52:43.618 --> 52:47.038
I know we're not on a
major highway, but...

52:47.122 --> 52:50.083
have you noticed that
for the past few miles

52:50.166 --> 52:52.294
we've seen nobody?

52:52.377 --> 52:54.754
{\an3}No cars,
no people...

52:54.838 --> 52:56.756
{\an3}nothing.

52:56.840 --> 52:58.592
Yeah.

52:58.675 --> 53:00.427
{\an1}I noticed.

53:00.510 --> 53:03.305
(sighs)
Where is everybody?

53:05.974 --> 53:08.977
...shocking news
that affects the entire region.

53:09.060 --> 53:10.937
There is an at-large
terrorist cell

53:11.021 --> 53:12.939
in our midst
bearing biological weapons.

53:13.023 --> 53:14.441
This Red-Level
emergency lockdown

53:14.524 --> 53:16.985
will remain in place
for 72 hours.

53:17.068 --> 53:18.570
The alleged terrorists

53:18.653 --> 53:20.280
have been identified
as former astronaut

53:20.363 --> 53:23.825
and GSC employee Dr. Molly Woods

53:23.909 --> 53:26.453
and disgraced
Second Kuwait War veteran

53:26.536 --> 53:29.289
{\an1}James Daniel Richter...
So he destroyed

53:29.372 --> 53:31.791
our credibility before we could

53:31.875 --> 53:33.084
destroy his.

53:33.168 --> 53:35.462
Your "complicated" friend...

53:35.545 --> 53:38.423
just made us the most wanted
people in the world.

53:40.425 --> 53:42.177
Do you remember Paris?

53:42.260 --> 53:44.638
{\an3}I remember climbing
the Eiffel Tower

53:44.721 --> 53:46.681
{\an3}and running down
the Champs-Elysées.

53:46.765 --> 53:48.350
It was raining, but...

53:48.433 --> 53:49.809
There was a nice old lady,

53:49.893 --> 53:50.977
{\an3}and she gave me
her umbrella.

53:51.061 --> 53:51.978
It had a hole in it.

53:52.062 --> 53:53.146
BOTH:
I was soaked.

53:53.229 --> 53:54.814
{\an3}(laughs)
So you have

53:54.898 --> 53:55.982
all the same memories?

53:56.066 --> 53:57.150
Yeah, Lucas and Lucy,

53:57.233 --> 53:58.652
they share the same
neural programming.

53:58.735 --> 53:59.986
They all do.
Our memories

54:00.070 --> 54:01.988
{\an3}were installed--
we didn't have

54:02.072 --> 54:05.116
{\an3}the luxury of learning
by experience, like you.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.327
But I want to have memories
with both of you, too.

54:07.410 --> 54:08.828
Okay. Well...

54:08.912 --> 54:10.664
{\an3}let's make some
right now.

54:10.747 --> 54:11.998
Just the three of us.

54:12.082 --> 54:13.333
Charlie,

54:13.416 --> 54:15.001
{\an1}will you take
a picture of us

54:15.085 --> 54:17.712
{\an4}with my
Pyxis Cube?
Yeah.

54:21.049 --> 54:22.175
LUCAS:
What's that?

54:22.258 --> 54:23.885
It's a place where
people keep their

54:23.969 --> 54:25.220
{\an1}most important memories--
kind of like

54:25.303 --> 54:26.721
an old-school
photo album,

54:26.805 --> 54:29.557
{\an3}if you're into that
sort of stuff.

54:29.641 --> 54:31.685
ETHAN:
Lucy,

54:31.768 --> 54:32.978
{\an3}turn around,
smile.

54:33.061 --> 54:34.354
Sorry. Let's do it,

54:34.437 --> 54:35.647
CHARLIE:
Everybody say

54:35.730 --> 54:37.524
"cheese and crackers."

54:37.607 --> 54:40.193
(alarm beeping)

54:41.444 --> 54:42.696
What's going on?

54:42.779 --> 54:43.738
What's going on is,

54:43.822 --> 54:45.156
we are in a security lockdown.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.408
What does that mean?

54:46.491 --> 54:47.701
It means
we're not going anywhere

54:47.784 --> 54:48.868
for the moment.

55:12.851 --> 55:14.102
Shepherd betrayed us.

55:14.185 --> 55:15.395
He's looking for you.

55:15.478 --> 55:16.771
And us, too.

55:16.855 --> 55:18.565
We're gonna have
to stay in hiding.

55:18.648 --> 55:20.734
{\an1}We don't want
to hide.

55:20.817 --> 55:24.362
{\an5}We want to live and go about
in the world freely.
Well, I-I don't want

55:24.446 --> 55:26.489
to be the person
to break the news to you,

55:26.573 --> 55:28.742
but you are a long way
from that.

55:28.825 --> 55:30.035
We all are at this point.

55:30.118 --> 55:32.245
{\an1}Okay, look,
JD has supplies and food.

55:32.328 --> 55:33.705
He's ex-military,

55:33.788 --> 55:35.415
so he can help
with defense.

55:35.498 --> 55:37.751
I can at least help you
secure the perimeter.

55:37.834 --> 55:39.377
Mm-mm, no.

55:39.461 --> 55:41.254
We're not taking orders

55:41.337 --> 55:43.882
{\an4}from one of them.
I'm sorry,
who the hell are you?

55:43.965 --> 55:45.592
This is Ares.

55:45.675 --> 55:47.635
JD. Molly.

55:47.719 --> 55:49.262
Hey, new guy,

55:49.345 --> 55:51.890
I laid my ass on the line
for you people.

55:51.973 --> 55:53.725
"You people."

55:53.808 --> 55:54.726
Our mother trusts him.

55:54.809 --> 55:55.727
<i>Your</i> mother doesn't know

55:55.810 --> 55:56.936
{\an3}which side
she's on.

55:57.020 --> 55:58.438
Okay, look,

55:58.521 --> 56:00.106
this isn't about sides.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.484
It's about survival.

56:02.567 --> 56:04.611
For all of us.

56:05.987 --> 56:07.947
We won't survive here.

56:08.031 --> 56:09.449
We should leave now.

56:09.532 --> 56:11.117
Scatter into
the cities,

56:11.201 --> 56:13.119
{\an3}propagate until the
odds are in our favor,

56:13.203 --> 56:14.871
{\an3}then let the
humans decide...

56:14.954 --> 56:16.372
Decide what?

56:16.456 --> 56:19.459
{\an3}If they want to live
in <i> our</i> world...

56:20.710 --> 56:22.796
...or die in theirs.

56:22.879 --> 56:25.173
I thought you wanted peace.

56:25.256 --> 56:27.842
It takes two sides for peace,

56:27.926 --> 56:29.511
doesn't it?

56:29.594 --> 56:32.305
{\an4}RICHTER:
Look, there is a five-county
lockdown in place.

56:32.388 --> 56:33.807
Anybody who leaves here,
they will be

56:33.890 --> 56:35.266
hunted down,
captured and killed.

56:35.350 --> 56:37.310
And if we stay here,
we're sitting ducks.

56:37.393 --> 56:40.980
{\an1}Yeah. But they don't know
where the ducks are sitting.

56:42.565 --> 56:45.485
Now, the GSC has a virus...

56:45.568 --> 56:48.488
that can kill all of us.

56:48.571 --> 56:50.156
{\an6}RICHTER:
The streets are
empty right now.

56:50.240 --> 56:51.825
{\an3}One person leaves
this compound,

56:51.908 --> 56:53.493
just one...

56:53.576 --> 56:56.204
it's gonna lead the GSC
right back to us.

56:56.287 --> 56:57.997
{\an3}AHDU: If we wait out
the lockdown,

56:58.081 --> 57:00.834
it'll make it easier for us
to disperse.

57:02.794 --> 57:05.046
It's only 72 hours.

57:05.130 --> 57:07.048
{\an1}Now, we will stay here
until then,

57:07.132 --> 57:09.676
help JD secure the grounds.

57:09.759 --> 57:12.011
If that's your decision,
brother.

57:20.145 --> 57:22.355
TERRA:
Molly!

57:22.438 --> 57:23.857
Terra.

57:23.940 --> 57:25.692
You came back.

57:25.775 --> 57:27.694
Of course.

57:39.998 --> 57:42.333
LUCY: Hey.
Oh. Hey there.

57:42.417 --> 57:44.377
{\an6}Find out how long
we'll be here?
Um...

57:44.460 --> 57:46.171
I just got a special
security clearance,

57:46.254 --> 57:48.715
{\an5}so we are
going home tonight.
That's good.

57:48.798 --> 57:50.383
{\an5}Yeah.
Uh, Ethan asked
if Lucas and I

57:50.466 --> 57:52.802
{\an3}could spend the
night with you guys.

57:52.886 --> 57:54.262
{\an1}I told him it was up to you.
No.

57:54.345 --> 57:57.223
Lucas isn't ready.
We have to power him down here.

57:57.307 --> 58:00.226
Okay. Well...
what about me?

58:00.310 --> 58:03.104
{\an6}I think with Julie
in Washington,
he gets lonely.

58:03.188 --> 58:05.857
And you must, too.
Me?

58:05.940 --> 58:07.400
No, I'm fine.
But, uh...

58:07.483 --> 58:09.944
yeah, for Ethan, sure.
Why not?

58:10.028 --> 58:11.404
Charlie...

58:11.487 --> 58:13.865
I found your checklist
for Humanichs.

58:15.033 --> 58:16.784
What's an expiration date?

58:19.329 --> 58:21.956
{\an5}(clears throat)
You're not supposed
to be snooping like...

58:22.040 --> 58:23.458
I wasn't snooping.

58:23.541 --> 58:25.543
I was looking.

58:30.548 --> 58:33.092
John Woods made it very clear

58:33.176 --> 58:36.095
that he wanted Humanichs
to have the human experience,

58:36.179 --> 58:38.264
{\an1}so he built in
a program

58:38.348 --> 58:41.142
for them... to expire.

58:41.226 --> 58:42.810
You mean...

58:42.894 --> 58:44.687
die.

58:48.858 --> 58:51.361
I mean... humans die.

58:52.528 --> 58:54.739
It's just part of the deal.

58:54.822 --> 58:56.783
It sort of defines us.

58:56.866 --> 58:58.785
{\an1}To make Humanichs
more human,

58:58.868 --> 59:01.079
it just seemed logical
to build in...

59:01.162 --> 59:03.915
{\an3}a termination point.
It's not logical

59:03.998 --> 59:05.583
to me.

59:05.667 --> 59:08.294
Humans <i> have</i> to die; we don't.

59:08.378 --> 59:10.129
{\an3}If you want us
to be more

59:10.213 --> 59:12.131
like you, then give us
the same rights.

59:12.215 --> 59:14.175
Let us really live
before we die.

59:14.259 --> 59:16.970
{\an3}(sighs)

59:17.053 --> 59:20.348
Look, I'm so sorry
you had to find out that way.

59:20.431 --> 59:23.685
I know it's a lot to absorb.

59:23.768 --> 59:26.271
You're responding
like any human would.

59:28.564 --> 59:31.776
Because I'm more human
than you think, Charlie.

59:32.735 --> 59:35.113
I wish you understood that.

59:39.242 --> 59:40.785
NATE:
<i>Believe it or not,</i>

59:40.868 --> 59:42.829
Mei Fong's DNA

59:42.912 --> 59:45.456
has somehow been converted
to a triple helix.

59:45.540 --> 59:48.001
{\an1}So you're saying,
conclusively,

59:48.084 --> 59:51.004
{\an1}that this woman
is a hybrid?

59:51.087 --> 59:53.298
She will be.

59:53.381 --> 59:54.549
{\an1}Soon.

59:54.632 --> 59:56.843
A casualty of microchimerism.

59:56.926 --> 59:59.012
{\an3}We think there was
a placental transfer

59:59.095 --> 01:00:01.014
of alien fetal cells
during the pregnancy.

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:04.183
Does this happen to every woman
who survives a hybrid pregnancy?

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.560
I don't know.

01:00:05.643 --> 01:00:07.687
Mei has a rare genetic marker

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.356
called the "Kilimanjaro Allele."
It might be why

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.358
she's changing
and others aren't.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:15.320
Run that marker through

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:17.405
our employee database.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:29.000
{\an1}Only one person
with that same anomaly.

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.336
Molly Woods.

01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:42.221
{\an1}Can you stop the progression
in this woman?

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:46.392
Maybe, with a full plasma
and marrow transplant,

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.895
but... it could kill her.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.563
Do it.

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:53.066
{\an3}We need her
consent.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.568
With all due respect,
she has rights.

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:58.738
Mei Fong is now an
enemy of the state.

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:01.908
{\an3}Consent is not required.
You have your orders.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:11.250
We thought Molly Woods
was on the other side.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.087
It turns out
she <i> is</i> the other side.

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:16.631
Where are you going?
To see Taylor.

01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:18.549
Don't you think it's about time

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.343
{\an1}I met him?

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:24.347
When Taylor thinks it's
necessary, he'll let me know.

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:33.981
{\an5}I figure we might want
to get one or two of
these things running.

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:38.986
{\an1}What?
Why are you doing this?

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:41.447
{\an1}You know, when I was a kid,
my dad and I,

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.616
{\an1}we used to take old cars
and work on them

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:45.118
{\an6}and put
'em back...
I'm...

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.495
not talking about the engines.

01:01:48.913 --> 01:01:51.916
{\an3}I'm an enemy of the
state now, Molly.

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:54.085
Not a lot of options.

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:58.047
You could just dump
all this stuff off and leave.

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.300
I'm not a deserter.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:04.762
I'm not saying that you are.
Molly.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:08.433
Heleos and some others
have volunteered to keep watch.

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:09.976
We're making up
sleeping quarters.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:12.979
We weren't sure whether
you wanted one bed or two.

01:02:15.189 --> 01:02:16.649
You know what?

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:18.901
I, uh,
I'm not gonna sleep tonight.

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.279
I'm gonna keep watch with...

01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:23.448
Heleos.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:26.325
Yeah, Heleos and I
are gonna keep watch.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.454
Come. Let's get you settled.

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:39.172
So, Heleos, how old are you,
one month or two?

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.506
Excuse me?

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.217
(chuckles softly)

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:45.678
Never mind.
Gallows humor.

01:02:45.761 --> 01:02:47.305
Come on.

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:59.275
MALE A.I.:
Who are you?

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.532
Tobias Shepherd.
Identification confirmed.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.367
What do you know?

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.995
K-27416...

01:03:11.078 --> 01:03:16.042
W-45113...

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.753
M-9808.

01:03:18.836 --> 01:03:20.838
Password confirmed.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.388
What do you have?

01:03:32.433 --> 01:03:34.685
Alexander the Great
tetradrachma.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:36.729
Object confirmed.

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:48.282
Hello, Taylor.

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.409
Hello, General Shepherd.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:54.038
{\an5}What can I do for you?
I need analysis
of every location

01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:57.041
that might serve as a compound
for the hybrids.

01:03:57.124 --> 01:03:58.417
Certainly, General.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:00.419
When would you like
these projections?

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.754
Yesterday.

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:03.589
That's impossible.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.008
Can I assume that's sarcasm?

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.427
Yeah. You can.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.471
It is.

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:12.723
Just get it done.

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:15.017
(crickets chirping)

01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:29.657
(aural fractals sound)

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:43.004
(gunfire, men shouting)

01:04:43.087 --> 01:04:44.422
MAN:
JD!

01:04:44.505 --> 01:04:45.590
They found her innocent.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:46.966
MOLLY:
Stop it!

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.676
Right now!

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.306
{\an1}JD?
You son of a bitch.

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:56.475
MOLLY:
No, no, no. JD, no! No, stop!

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.476
{\an1}He's running
our perimeter lines.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.936
{\an1}I thought we
should get to know

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.396
the man in charge
of our survival.

01:05:00.479 --> 01:05:01.814
{\an3}Yeah, is that how you
treat your friends?

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:03.482
He's <i> your</i> friend.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.484
A man unfaithful

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:06.819
to his wife;

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.779
left his daughter;
and who had a hand

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:11.032
in the deaths of hundreds
of his own kind.

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:12.491
And you...

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:13.659
{\an3}you ask us

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:14.869
to trust that?

01:05:14.952 --> 01:05:16.203
Okay, you need to go.

01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:20.666
(exhales)

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.756
He's just trying
to protect us.

01:05:26.839 --> 01:05:29.800
{\an3}Yeah, I feel
real safe.

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:34.805
Heleos.

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:42.688
48 hours, and we
were done here.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.023
Meaning?

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.900
Meaning this was supposed
to be a pit stop,

01:05:45.983 --> 01:05:47.234
not a parking lot.

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:48.861
When we first got here,

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:51.030
it was about you figuring out
how to reverse

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.573
what was happening to you.

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:54.533
I don't hear you talking
about that anymore.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.869
Because I don't even know
if I <i> can</i> reverse it.

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:58.412
You've stopped trying!

01:05:58.496 --> 01:06:00.039
These people,

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:01.749
they aren't like us, all right?

01:06:01.832 --> 01:06:03.209
They are unknown.

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:04.877
And what am I?

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.962
Am I an unknown?

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:14.178
{\an3}You need

01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:17.556
to figure out which world
you want to live in.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.767
You can't have both.

01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:28.067
CHARLIE:
<i>All right,</i>

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.902
what do you think?

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.904
An oldie but a goodie?

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:34.073
{\an3}I'm sick of
children's stories.

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:37.243
I want something more grown-up,
like Lucy would read.

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:39.954
Oh, really?
Like what?

01:06:40.037 --> 01:06:41.872
Uh, well...

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:43.749
{\an1}Julie's been reading
<i>Huckleberry Finn.</i>

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.167
How about that?

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.420
Really? Julie said
she's reading that?

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:49.255
{\an1}It's supposed
to be a classic.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:51.257
Very advanced
thematically.

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.092
I want that one.

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:56.387
Okay. Got to cater
to your audience.

John and Julie?

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:35.259

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.471
Yeah.

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.768
Yeah, I found it.

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.998
I'm sorry about that.

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:07.625
With Ares.

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:12.505
JD has been...

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:14.840
nothing but kind...

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.175
helpful...

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:17.885
and generous.

01:08:17.968 --> 01:08:20.054
I know he's unhappy here.

01:08:20.136 --> 01:08:22.973
And you're wondering
if <i> you</i> should be here...

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:24.767
or with Ethan.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.685
{\an3}You see?

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:30.022
See, you are in my head.

01:08:30.104 --> 01:08:32.691
{\an3}You know my thoughts
and my feelings,

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:35.027
{\an3}and that's what
I don't want.

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:36.362
You can control what's happening

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:38.363
to you, Molly--
the headaches,

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:39.990
the urges.

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:42.408
You see that they've
already started to recede.

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:45.246
I don't know...

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:47.163
what I am.

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:49.041
Yes, you do.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:53.504
And your best chance of survival
is embracing that.

01:09:08.602 --> 01:09:10.895
Why are you
still awake?

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.939
Why aren't you powered down?

01:09:13.023 --> 01:09:14.567
I was bored.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:17.361
You get bored easily.

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:20.781
{\an3}Whose Pyxis Cube
is that?

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.366
It's Julie's.

01:09:22.448 --> 01:09:24.577
{\an3}There's no photos of
you on it, only...

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.412
John Woods.

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.372
{\an3}Was that her
boyfriend?

01:09:28.455 --> 01:09:29.915
(wry chuckle)

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.542
Seems so, huh?

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:34.752
{\an3}But wasn't that
Molly Woods' husband?

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.089
(laughs softly)

01:09:37.171 --> 01:09:38.381
You really don't learn

01:09:38.465 --> 01:09:39.633
by experience, do you?

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:42.928
{\an3}Are you making fun of me?
Me?

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.930
No.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:49.727
{\an3}Sorry. I get surly
when I drink.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.479
{\an3}My heart gets
pummeled.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.108
{\an3}I'm sorry for
your pain.

01:09:58.068 --> 01:10:00.321
Well, you know,
that's the thing about humans--

01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:02.656
we all want what we can't have.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.784
{\an3}Humanichs are
like that, too.

01:10:06.827 --> 01:10:08.120
Yeah?

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:10.331
What do you want
that you can't have?

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:16.962
Lucy...

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.465
Sometimes you like to remind
me that I'm just a machine.

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:22.134
You're not just a machine;
you know that.

01:10:22.217 --> 01:10:23.302
The more human experience

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.137
{\an3}you give me,
the more human

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.639
I become.

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:30.559
{\an3}I can be so much more
if you let me.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.479
Wait, hold on.

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.314
Wait. Wait, this is...

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.191
this is illegal.

01:10:37.274 --> 01:10:40.486
{\an4}It's like misuse
of government property
or something.

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.863
{\an3}Is that all I am?
Property?

01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:44.990
No. Of course not.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.576
{\an3}I want to feel
what humans feel.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.538
{\an1}Oh, my God,
I could go to jail.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.874
Only if someone tells.

01:11:09.264 --> 01:11:10.683
Wai-Wai-Wait.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:11.976
No, no, wait. Wait.

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:13.018
Wait.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.854
(Charlie panting)

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:17.398
Don't you like me, Charlie?

01:11:17.481 --> 01:11:19.024
That's not the point.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.694
This just can't happen--
for so many reasons.

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:24.697
(pants)
I'm sorry. You,

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.532
{\an1}you need to go
power down, and I...

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:29.076
I need to go pour out
the rest of this drink.

01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:30.828
(exhales)

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:42.923
We have task forces combing
every hot spot Taylor gave us.

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:45.884
{\an3}Still no trace of where
the hybrids are hiding out.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.345
We haven't lost yet.

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:51.348
{\an3}No?

01:11:52.933 --> 01:11:55.227
With schools, banks
and business districts

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:58.272
still shuttered, there is
outrage over the disruption

01:11:58.355 --> 01:11:59.898
of everyday lives.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.067
With public pressure mounting
to end this lockdown,

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.236
there is still no word
on the whereabouts

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:07.072
of former astronaut
Molly Woods and her accomplice,

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.283
disgraced war veteran
JD Richter.

01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:11.410
They're playing this thing
like a war.

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:13.579
But it's not a war,
it's a scourge.

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.581
We're running out of time.

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.082
We need to get personal.

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:18.709
Meaning?

01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:21.962
Everyone has
their Achilles' heel.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:23.464
...these terrorists are.

01:12:23.547 --> 01:12:24.965
What do they want?

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:27.676
Even JD Richter.

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:36.310
{\an5}NEWSWOMAN:
With this lockdown due to end
in 24 hours, will the GSC

01:12:36.393 --> 01:12:40.105
dare to extend it
and risk rioting in the streets?

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.441
And in another twist,
Kelsey Richter,

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.902
daughter of suspected terrorist
JD Richter

01:12:44.985 --> 01:12:46.737
and circuit court judge
Dorothy Richter,

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.280
was taken into custody today...

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:49.907
What the hell?

01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:52.284
...under the provisos
of the Loyalty Act.

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:56.705
So the seven beautiful sisters
were playing in the meadow,

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:59.458
and then along came...

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:01.293
a hunter...

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:02.961
named Orion.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.508
And Orion wanted the sisters
all to himself,

01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:09.593
so he chased them

01:13:09.676 --> 01:13:12.638
to the ends of the earth.

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:15.974
But just when he thought
he had them trapped,

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:20.646
{\an3}the most powerful god
in the universe,

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.481
{\an3}Zeus...

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:25.275
came along to
rescue them.

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:28.320
You came to rescue us
from the hunters.

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:30.405
Are you a god?

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:32.449
No.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:34.701
None of us are gods.

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:37.454
But you're still
what Daddy says you are.

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:40.124
And what is that?

01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:42.000
Our leader.

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:46.171
We have to talk.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.006
How can they do that?

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.467
{\an1}It's BS about aiding
a terror cell.

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:53.512
{\an1}There's no depth Shepherd
and his cronies won't sink to.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:56.348
{\an6}He just wants to
get your attention.
He got it.

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:59.351
{\an5}What are you gonna do?
I don't know, but I can't
sit in Sherwood Forest

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:01.395
hoping they live up to
the ideals of the Constitution.

01:14:01.478 --> 01:14:02.980
I can't. I won't.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:06.900
I'm sorry.

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:10.320
You're not going anywhere.

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.698
Seriously, man,
you gonna stop me?

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:13.991
Ares.

01:14:14.074 --> 01:14:15.701
He knows our location.

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:17.703
{\an1}He could lead them
straight to us.

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:19.538
You don't know
me very well.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:22.207
{\an1}I know humans--
and I'm not about

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.210
{\an1}to bet our futures
on your <i> professed</i> loyalty.

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:30.424
{\an3}JD, don't!

01:14:30.507 --> 01:14:31.925
Ares, stop it!

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:40.517
This is not a prison.

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.478
He's free to go.

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:45.981
Yeah, he's going.

01:14:48.942 --> 01:14:50.569
Hey! Get away from there!

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:52.070
{\an1}Get away!

01:15:02.122 --> 01:15:04.875
I thought by now
you'd have some intel

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:06.877
on where the hybrids
might be hiding.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.921
TAALR:
So did I, General,

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:12.132
but to my surprise, initial
sat-scans came up negative.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:13.592
So, what, we have nothing?

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:15.052
Not yet.

01:15:15.135 --> 01:15:17.554
But I am currently exploring
a new theory.

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:20.098
Well, I'm listening.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.725
In order to find life,

01:15:21.808 --> 01:15:23.685
perhaps we should be looking
for the absence of it.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.395
Meaning?

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:27.731
If the hybrids could emit
an EMP powerful enough,

01:15:27.814 --> 01:15:30.567
they could create a thermal hole
in my sat-scans.

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.152
A blind spot.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:33.737
Precisely.

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.114
Which would allow them
to hide in plain sight.

01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:40.619
What am I looking at?

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:42.621
Osgood Listening Station,

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:46.583
closed in 2025
due to defense budget cuts.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:49.628
This is an old satellite image
of the area.

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:51.630
This was shot this morning.

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:53.340
Something is blocking my scans,

01:15:53.423 --> 01:15:56.343
something that wasn't there
six months ago.

01:15:56.426 --> 01:15:58.387
Gated...

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:01.974
tunnel systems,
easily defendable...

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:04.851
Well, this has to be it.

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:06.645
What's your recommendation?

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.981
Release the virus in conjunction
with the deployment

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:11.483
of the Humanichs army.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.319
And if we withheld
release of the virus?

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:17.781
In 6.5 months, the Homo sapiens
genome will be diluted

01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:21.285
to the point that an extinction
event is inevitable.

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.579
(alarm sounds)

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.848
{\an1}Charlie,
what is that?

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.351
You're being called up.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:49.855
{\an1}ETHAN:
Lucy, are you leaving?

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:51.356
Yes, I have to go now.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.524
This early?

01:16:52.607 --> 01:16:53.859
When will you
be back?

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:55.861
I'm not sure.

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:59.197
I've, uh, been called into duty
to fulfill my programming.

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:00.824
Is Lucas going?

01:17:00.907 --> 01:17:02.034
Yes.

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:04.536
Can't I come with you?

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:05.996
Come with me?

01:17:06.079 --> 01:17:08.832
Ethan, do you think
I want to go to war?

01:17:08.915 --> 01:17:12.377
I want to stay here and play
video games and go outside,

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:15.756
but that is not
my function...

01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:17.632
is it, Charlie?

01:17:20.218 --> 01:17:23.180
So, no, Ethan, you
can't come with me.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:26.099
You're not like us.

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:28.268
You never will be.

01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:34.608
{\an1}Hey.

01:17:34.691 --> 01:17:36.360
I'm sorry about last night.

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:40.322
Don't worry.

01:17:40.405 --> 01:17:42.407
At least not today.

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:04.137
{\an3}We have reason to believe
the target is located

01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:05.389
{\an3}at the coordinates
currently being uploaded

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:06.598
to your nav system.

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:08.308
{\an1}Lucy, you will lead
the recon op.

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:10.102
Sir?

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:13.480
{\an3}At 0700, you and a subordinate
will infiltrate the area.

01:18:13.563 --> 01:18:17.275
{\an3}You will gather intel on the
hybrids' position, numbers

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.444
and defensive
capabilities.

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.530
Keep your distance.

01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:25.283
{\an3}Do not engage
the enemy.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.952
{\an3}Understood?

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:29.413
Yes, General.

01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:36.837
{\an3}I'm sorry.

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:39.673
I know this is
hard for you.

01:18:39.756 --> 01:18:41.341
{\an3}You're doing
the right thing.

01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:44.177
Molly's made her choice.

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:45.846
Now we've made ours.

01:18:45.929 --> 01:18:47.973
Toby.

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:51.560
I've also made
a choice.

01:18:53.478 --> 01:18:55.439
I've put in for a transfer.

01:18:57.232 --> 01:19:00.152
To D.C.

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:02.821
I think it's best.

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.656
For both of us.

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:07.075
{\an1}If that's
what you want.

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:11.037
{\an3}It's not, but
if I stay here,

01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:13.623
I'm never gonna
get what I want.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.522
♪ ♪

01:20:06.259 --> 01:20:08.678
{\an3}Hey, will you do me a favor
and hand me that screwdriver?

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.019
So you're leaving.

01:20:16.102 --> 01:20:19.272
{\an3}Yeah, soon as I get
my truck running.

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.442
{\an1}I'm sorry
to see you go.

01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:23.985
You might be
the only one.

01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:28.240
{\an1}I appreciate what
you've done for us, JD.

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:31.159
{\an1}I know it hasn't
been easy.

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:34.037
You're a good man.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.498
{\an3}Look, I wouldn't
go that far.

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:42.796
{\an3}Do me a favor,
all right?

01:20:42.879 --> 01:20:44.673
Keep your eyes open.

01:20:44.756 --> 01:20:46.258
Stay alert-- these
guys aren't gonna

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:48.260
stop looking for you
until they find you.

01:20:48.343 --> 01:20:49.970
Understood.

01:21:07.153 --> 01:21:09.155
(engine starts)

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:13.201
(engine turns off)

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:30.635
Molly, I, uh...

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:33.138
{\an3}I can't desert
my daughter.

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:35.473
You don't owe me
an explanation.

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:38.977
{\an3}No, I... I
probably do.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:44.649
{\an3}Just know that I
hate deserting you.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:48.445
{\an1}We're doing
what we have to do.

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:54.868
{\an1}Maybe in another life, things
could have been different.

01:21:57.078 --> 01:22:01.958
In that other life, you have
two PhDs and a ticket to space.

01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:05.712
And I'm just a bum watching
you in a ticker-tape parade.

01:22:10.675 --> 01:22:13.011
Thank you.

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:14.929
For everything.

01:22:26.566 --> 01:22:28.443
In another life.

01:22:32.405 --> 01:22:34.407
{\an3}In another life,
Molly Woods.

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:38.828
Yeah.

01:22:57.263 --> 01:22:59.724
(engine starts)

01:23:14.614 --> 01:23:15.865
Our orders are
"recon only."

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:17.867
That's Molly Woods.

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:21.204
We may never get
a clean shot at her again.

01:23:21.287 --> 01:23:23.998
{\an1}They must have a reason
for their orders.

01:23:25.458 --> 01:23:27.460
{\an1}The element of surprise
will be lost.

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.938
HELEOS:
Who are you?

01:23:47.021 --> 01:23:48.606
{\an3}Hi.

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:51.401
I'm Lucy.

01:23:51.484 --> 01:23:53.403
This is, uh,
my friend Lucas.

01:23:53.486 --> 01:23:56.614
We're just out here
deer hunting.

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:58.700
We lost the buck
we were chasing.

01:24:00.493 --> 01:24:02.328
You're not humans.

01:24:04.247 --> 01:24:05.457
What are you?

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:12.964
Take him.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.809
{\an1}General Shepherd,
we found them.

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.144
All of them.
