WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:04.171
-Previously on The Resident...
-Randolph Bell.

00:04.171 --> 00:07.574
-Will you marry me?
-Thank God.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.910
-Because I can't return this.
-(laughs softly)

00:09.910 --> 00:11.245
Are you in love with Cade?

00:11.245 --> 00:13.213
All I know is that
whatever I feel

00:13.213 --> 00:16.250
only goes so far,
and then the walls come up.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.185
Maybe you just need
a little push.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.520
DEVON:
It's like he wants to relive

00:19.520 --> 00:22.055
what happened to Nic
and rewrite the ending.

00:22.055 --> 00:24.124
I wish we could
rewrite our ending.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.026
Your father's here.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.128
Just flew in from Seattle.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.637
Hey, Molly. Look at you,
getting out of here.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.672
Yep. Thanks for all the fun
books, Doc Sullivan.

00:38.672 --> 00:42.376
-How's your daughter?
-On the mend at last.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.481
Morris, what's happening?

00:47.481 --> 00:49.383
Just you, Doc.
Rocking that suit.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.286
(chuckles)
Laura, good morning.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.654
-Morning, Doc.
-Has anyone ever told you

00:53.654 --> 00:55.289
you look like Sophia Loren?

00:55.289 --> 00:59.092
-Only you. But that's okay.
-Ah. (inhales sharply)

00:59.092 --> 01:00.994
I got this twinge
driving me crazy.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.262
I think I pulled a muscle

01:02.262 --> 01:04.264
playing a ferocious
pickleball game.

01:04.264 --> 01:06.333
You think maybe you could
find me a muscle relaxer?

01:06.333 --> 01:07.835
Uh, you know I can't do that.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.204
But I've got some ibuprofen
in my purse if you would like...

01:10.204 --> 01:11.605
Gives me a stomachache.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.741
I'll get a massage later,
tough it out till then.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.245
(knocking on door)

01:18.245 --> 01:21.315
Good morning, love.
How we feeling today?

01:21.315 --> 01:25.152
Hi, Dad. Conrad's just
finishing up his examination.

01:25.152 --> 01:28.155
-What's the good word,
Dr. Hawkins?
-Hey.

01:28.155 --> 01:30.290
CBC and 'lytes are stable,

01:30.290 --> 01:31.758
one low-grade fever
controlled with meds

01:31.758 --> 01:33.393
and you are getting
your color back.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.295
CONRAD:
She's doing really well.

01:35.295 --> 01:38.198
Next step, get her out of bed,
up and moving.

01:38.198 --> 01:40.567
She's just being
a little stubborn.

01:40.567 --> 01:41.435
Hmm.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.371
I think I know
what that problem is.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.740
There's no longer a guard
outside the door.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.710
I know they caught the men
who tried to kill me.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.512
I understand, intellectually,

01:51.512 --> 01:54.848
but I just, I don't want
to leave this room.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.984
Totally normal PTSD.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.485
You'll beat it.

01:58.485 --> 02:01.522
I miss that feisty girl
with the chip on her shoulder.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.258
(chuckles)
Yeah.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.727
I'd love to see you do
a walk around the unit today.

02:06.727 --> 02:10.831
With a walker, someone by
your side to make you feel safe.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.466
Come on, Cade. You and me.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.468
Once around the unit,
like when you were a kid.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.769
Even better.

02:16.703 --> 02:19.239
Don't get me wrong,
I'm loving the attention,

02:19.239 --> 02:22.309
but who are you again?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.644
(laughs)

02:23.644 --> 02:25.179
I practically raised myself.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.481
This guy was always
at the hospital.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.616
-And now...
-You're his patient.

02:29.616 --> 02:32.119
-Bingo.
-Who doesn't love
being psychoanalyzed

02:32.119 --> 02:35.322
by two totally
unqualified people?

02:35.322 --> 02:37.724
A gift. To soothe your belly.

02:40.627 --> 02:41.828
-Banana pudding?
-Mm.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.630
Are you trying to kill me?

02:44.865 --> 02:46.133
I'm allergic.

02:46.133 --> 02:49.136
I almost died when I was four.
Remember?

02:50.270 --> 02:52.072
I thought that was strawberries.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.075
My apology. I'm gonna go

02:55.075 --> 02:57.211
to the cafeteria right now
and I'll be back

02:57.211 --> 02:59.847
with the best chocolate pudding
in the house.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.515
Then we walk.

03:05.252 --> 03:08.555
-Your father, he's...
-He's a mixed blessing.

03:08.555 --> 03:13.527
He's a god to his patients
and himself.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.530
You know who really loves
banana pudding?

03:17.598 --> 03:19.066
Him.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.035
Story of my life.

03:23.637 --> 03:27.374
Marco Anza, 14-year-old male,
syncopal episode.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.476
History
of osteogenesis imperfecta.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.312
IRVING:
Hey, Marco,
my name is Dr. Feldman.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.815
-Can you tell me what happened?
-MARCO: I fell off

03:34.815 --> 03:35.883
my neighbor's bike.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.317
My mom's gonna kill me.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.520
She followed the ambulance.
She'll be here any minute.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.922
All right, we got you, buddy.
On my count.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.024
One, two, three.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.463
I'm not supposed to bike.

03:49.463 --> 03:53.267
I-I got dizzy
and everything went black

03:53.267 --> 03:55.836
and that's when I fell...

03:55.836 --> 03:57.104
(monitor beeping rapidly)

03:57.104 --> 03:58.405
He's in V tach.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.973
Go get a crash cart
and Dr. Austin.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.308
IRVING:
Thready pulse.

04:01.308 --> 04:03.310
Prepare to do chest compressions
if he codes.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.746
I'm his mother. Uh, no CPR.
His-his bones break

04:05.746 --> 04:08.849
with the slightest pressure,
he has osteogenesis imperfecta.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.218
-Where's that crash cart?
-AUSTIN: Right here.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.153
All right,
I'll get these pads on him

04:13.153 --> 04:15.088
and you charge to 200.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.927
Uh, Doctor, please
don't let my baby die.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.862
Please, God, please, please.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.463
All right, clear.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.434
-(thumps)
-(monitor beeps)

04:28.902 --> 04:31.738
(exhales)
Sinus tach at 110.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.340
All right.

04:33.340 --> 04:36.844
He's okay, Mom. He's stable.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.112
Thank you. Thank you.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.315
That was terrifying.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.483
I don't understand.
Why did his heart stop?

04:43.483 --> 04:46.153
It didn't. It went
into a dangerous rhythm,

04:46.153 --> 04:48.755
and now we have
to figure out why.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.858
Marco.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.260
Honey, it's Mom. Talk to me.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.962
Please, talk to me, honey.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.164
My back really hurts.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.166
-IRVING: What'd he say?
-His back hurts.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.335
Another possible injury
from the fall?

05:02.002 --> 05:03.504
He could have broken anything.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.739
It's exactly why he's never
supposed to be on a bicycle.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.508
Answer box.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.610
Yeah. All right, people.

05:09.610 --> 05:14.081
Let's get this young man
ready for X-ray and CT.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.652
♪

05:31.365 --> 05:33.200
Are you back at work, Albert?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.802
Yeah, just in time
for the midterms,

05:35.802 --> 05:38.906
much to the chagrin
of my students.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.008
I'm sure they are thrilled
to have you back.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.243
Well, they did make
a TikTok video

05:43.243 --> 05:46.246
reciting the periodic table
while twerking.

05:46.246 --> 05:50.317
I suppose that's their version
of a "Get well soon" card.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.685
That is something
that I'd like to see.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.655
And there's something
that I want to show you.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.195
-These are your lungs.
-Mm-hmm.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.529
DEVON: Do you
notice anything different?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.631
This is what
they looked like before.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.270
-ALBERT: No tumors.
-That's right.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.806
If I didn't know
you entered our clinical trial

06:12.806 --> 06:16.076
with advanced lung cancer,
I'd say that these are the lungs

06:16.076 --> 06:18.278
of a completely healthy man.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.614
(laughs)

06:20.614 --> 06:23.383
O-Okay, wait, wait.
Complete remission?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.018
-Yeah, man.
-Oh, my gosh.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.920
-(chuckles)
-Thank you.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.323
Thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

06:29.323 --> 06:34.194
I know this trial was brutal,
but it worked.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.864
Yeah, yeah-- And the science.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.532
The science.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.133
You found answers.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.402
More people will benefit, right?

06:42.402 --> 06:45.572
Now call Grace,
and give her the good news.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.278
<i>BELL:</i>
<i>Okay, here's my idea.</i>

06:51.278 --> 06:53.380
We got four marriages
between us.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.517
Do we really need a ceremony?

06:56.517 --> 06:58.252
I mean, we could elope.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.153
Just you, me,
a justice of the peace,

07:00.153 --> 07:02.489
followed by a wild honeymoon

07:02.489 --> 07:05.359
at the destination
of your choice.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.996
Um... Whoa, I'm-I'm sorry.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.497
I was told that you wanted
to see me?

07:10.497 --> 07:12.232
-(Bell chuckles)
-KIT: Yes, please.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.834
We both do. Please, come in.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.135
Yeah, and congratulations

07:15.135 --> 07:18.071
on your incredibly successful
clinical trial.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.541
KIT: And the rabies protocol
with Conrad.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.642
We are so proud of you.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.111
Especially since you
trained here at Chastain.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.648
What she's really saying
is she's terrified.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.750
And we don't want to lose you.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.451
KIT:
Dare I ask?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.854
Are you being courted
by the great research hospitals

07:33.854 --> 07:35.489
of the world?

07:37.024 --> 07:39.359
Actually, yes.

07:39.359 --> 07:44.231
Baltimore Hospital of Advanced
Sciences is flying me up today.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.532
Wow.

07:45.532 --> 07:48.168
We will match any offer.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.904
Thank you. But there
is no official offer to match,

07:50.904 --> 07:52.339
and money is not
the only factor.

07:52.339 --> 07:56.276
There are... um, issues here.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.846
Personal ones, I imagine.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.614
Yes.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.517
-We're rooting
for you and Leela.
-Thank you.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.152
I appreciate that.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.388
Uh, I almost forgot.

08:08.388 --> 08:11.158
Congratulations on your,
on your engagement.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.393
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.299
Oh, the poor guy.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.435
You know, his career
is accelerating like a Ferrari,

08:21.435 --> 08:26.139
and, you know, all he can think
of is the empty passenger seat.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.476
Thank you. Okay, I better go.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.712
I got a crazy day.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.317
AUSTIN:
Wow.

08:37.317 --> 08:40.420
There have got to be over
200 healed fractures here.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.457
Mm, it's no wonder
his mother's so protective.

08:43.457 --> 08:46.527
Osteogenesis imperfecta
is a brutal disease.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.263
Every time your kid stumbles,
a bone can break.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.498
And bone pain is terrible.

08:51.498 --> 08:55.135
-You ever broken any?
-Lucky for me, only one.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.005
-Proximal humerus.
-Hmm. How?

08:58.005 --> 09:01.975
Oh, that's a long story
involving a skateboard ramp

09:01.975 --> 09:04.778
and a very dumb teenage AJ.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.480
And a cat.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.616
Don't ask.

09:11.185 --> 09:13.654
Well, there's a new
spinal fracture, T11-T12,

09:13.654 --> 09:15.889
likely from the fall,
but we can fix that.

09:15.889 --> 09:21.028
AUSTIN:
But what concerns me the most is
the restrictive cardiomyopathy.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.363
With the severity
of his pectus excavatum,

09:23.363 --> 09:26.667
his rib cage is almost
strangling his heart.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.136
-The Ravitch procedure?
-Yeah.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.639
Break the bones of his sternum
and reset them to make room

09:32.639 --> 09:34.374
for his heart to work properly.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.177
It's an incredibly risky
operation for a kid with OI.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.179
Yeah, but if we don't fix it,

09:39.179 --> 09:43.383
Marco could go into
lethal rhythm again and die.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.921
I understand the upside
of the operation,

09:47.921 --> 09:50.457
and the danger for Marco
if we don't do it.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.359
But what about
the surgery itself?

09:52.359 --> 09:54.561
There is a risk
of damage to his heart

09:54.561 --> 09:57.331
and aortic aneurysm
once we saw through the bone.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.867
So, you could damage his heart

09:59.867 --> 10:03.337
while you're trying to repair
the bones that you are afraid

10:03.337 --> 10:05.405
-might strangle the heart?
-And again,

10:05.405 --> 10:08.509
these are bones that caused him
to black out on the bike

10:08.509 --> 10:10.344
when his heart went
into a lethal rhythm.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.246
BILLIE:
If we don't do the surgery,
any stress

10:12.246 --> 10:14.882
on his heart could worsen
the strain and kill him.

10:14.882 --> 10:19.520
So there's risks with or without
the surgery-- but far less

10:19.520 --> 10:23.123
if I just make sure that-that
he's never alone again.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.125
MARCO:
Never alone?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.727
Mom, are you kidding?
That's crazy.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.529
I-I don't want
to live like that.

10:28.529 --> 10:30.864
I don't want to be
wrapped in Bubble Wrap

10:30.864 --> 10:32.099
and put in a drawer.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.967
I want to do stuff.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.269
Honey, I know you do,

10:35.269 --> 10:36.603
but you have to accept
there's limitations.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.539
You can't do risky things
like go ride a bike.

10:38.539 --> 10:42.476
I-I get that I can't,
like, play football,

10:42.476 --> 10:45.379
but I'm not gonna stop
riding bikes.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.685
Did you know
his first fracture happened

10:51.685 --> 10:53.287
when he was three months old?

10:53.287 --> 10:55.255
I was putting a onesie
over his head

10:55.255 --> 10:57.925
and his collarbone just cracked.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.794
It's been 14 years of this.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.262
But we've managed.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.866
I've managed to keep
my boy safe.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.035
Mom, I-I love you,

11:08.035 --> 11:10.204
and I know
that you've protected me

11:10.204 --> 11:15.275
ever since I was a baby,
but safe isn't enough.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.978
I-I've done a bunch of research,

11:17.978 --> 11:21.281
and I can get better.

11:21.281 --> 11:24.985
I-I want to go to college.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.420
He's right.

11:26.420 --> 11:30.090
In some forms of OI,
fractures decrease after puberty

11:30.090 --> 11:31.792
when rapid bone growth
comes to an end.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.595
This may already
be happening with Marco.

11:34.595 --> 11:36.330
After a fall from a bike,
we'd expect to see

11:36.330 --> 11:38.098
far more fractures
than he has today.

11:38.098 --> 11:44.171
See, if they do the surgery,
I could totally be better.

11:49.176 --> 11:52.246
I'm sorry. This is a very,
very big decision.

11:52.246 --> 11:56.383
I... I have to think about it.

12:03.357 --> 12:04.892
Brave young man.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.427
-We both know we can fix him.
-Very brave.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.062
You know, the mom's
protected him so long,

12:09.062 --> 12:11.098
-she can't let go.
-Well, in medicine,

12:11.098 --> 12:14.034
as in life, no risk, no reward.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.003
Tell me about it.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.705
DEVON:
So he has Behcet's
and he's sick enough

12:18.705 --> 12:20.240
to be in the ICU?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.776
I am thinking pulse doses
of steroids.

12:22.776 --> 12:26.380
Ah, I thought maybe that was
the best course, but obviously,

12:26.380 --> 12:28.682
I had to confirm
with my partner.

12:28.682 --> 12:31.118
Somehow I don't think
that's why you came to find me.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.654
Another spot-on diagnosis.

12:33.654 --> 12:38.725
I heard you've got a job
interview up in Baltimore today.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.961
They're flying me
business class.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.796
Champagne before takeoff, baby.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.499
-Oh, wow.
-(chuckles)

12:49.703 --> 12:53.974
I remember when you were
a green, starry-eyed intern.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.210
Your first day at Chastain,
I took one look at you

12:56.210 --> 12:58.212
and I thought, "I got
to break this poor guy down

12:58.212 --> 13:00.781
and rebuild him
from the ground up."

13:00.781 --> 13:02.249
You were impossible.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.319
I tried very hard
to find another resident.

13:05.319 --> 13:09.890
And when the sun came up
on that first 37-hour shift...

13:09.890 --> 13:11.258
(sighs)

13:11.258 --> 13:12.626
...I was convinced
I'd made so many mistakes

13:12.626 --> 13:14.761
-that I'd never be a doctor.
-(chuckles)

13:14.761 --> 13:17.431
And you said this job
isn't easy.

13:17.431 --> 13:21.068
That if it were,
everyone would be a doctor

13:21.068 --> 13:25.405
because it is
the best job in the world,

13:25.405 --> 13:28.141
despite everything,
because of everything.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.844
That's still the case.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.446
All right.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.820
Now I'm gonna say
something selfish.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.022
Okay.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.391
Don't break up the team.

13:46.260 --> 13:49.563
I don't want to, trust me.

13:49.563 --> 13:52.099
You can work things out.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.667
She's worth it.

13:53.667 --> 13:58.005
And all your friends and
colleagues are here, you know?

14:00.741 --> 14:02.109
I don't know.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.378
I really don't.

14:04.378 --> 14:07.981
But I do know that I need
to see what else is out there.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.117
I get it.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.720
You've earned this.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.768
(sighs)

14:27.768 --> 14:30.037
♪

14:36.710 --> 14:40.113
-Uh, uh, uh...
-(laughing)

14:42.282 --> 14:44.551
♪

14:46.887 --> 14:48.722
(elevator dings)

15:08.842 --> 15:10.878
(knocking on door)

15:10.878 --> 15:12.846
Your pudding, darling.

15:12.846 --> 15:15.649
Thanks. Where you been?

15:15.649 --> 15:19.119
I went by the pharmacy
to get some medication for you.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.188
-Medication?
-Yeah, to help

15:21.188 --> 15:24.625
with this PTSD anxiety.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.995
I don't do benzos.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.263
And you're not
my prescribing doctor,

15:29.263 --> 15:32.065
so that's, you know, illegal.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.568
But thanks.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.172
Probably wise.
(chuckles)

15:38.172 --> 15:40.374
Maybe an overreaction
on my part.

15:40.374 --> 15:43.510
I just hate to see you
under duress.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.712
I'll take them back.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.048
Well, I promised
Conrad you and I

15:48.048 --> 15:50.284
would do our forced march
an hour ago.

15:50.284 --> 15:53.187
Let's do it.
Oh, that's Kit Voss, isn't it?

15:53.187 --> 15:55.556
-Yeah.
-Just give me a few minutes.

15:55.556 --> 15:57.791
I've been meaning
to introduce myself.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.626
I'll be right back.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.461
Dad.

16:02.296 --> 16:04.431
Ms. Voss, good afternoon.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.033
Oh, are you getting
in that elevator?

16:06.033 --> 16:08.468
KIT (distant):
You must be Cade's dad...

16:14.741 --> 16:16.977
<i>(heart beating)</i>

16:21.882 --> 16:23.584

16:34.695 --> 16:36.063

16:41.969 --> 16:43.637
(grunts softly)

16:46.840 --> 16:48.475
(groans)

16:53.647 --> 16:55.148
Help.

17:03.257 --> 17:05.993
Dr. Sutton, Dr. Austin.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.765
We've decided not
to do the surgery.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.434
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.970
Especially since Marco
seemed to be all in.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.405
Well, Marco's 14.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.574
He thinks potato chips
are a food group.

17:20.574 --> 17:23.343
I am his mother and I-I know
what's best for him.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.145
BILLIE:
Well, for the record,
our medical opinion

17:25.145 --> 17:26.780
is that surgery
is the best choice.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.382
AUSTIN:
Because we believe the risks

17:28.382 --> 17:30.817
of not doing it
far outweigh the risks of...

17:30.817 --> 17:33.987
Please, stop. Just stop.

17:33.987 --> 17:36.323
(sighs)

17:36.323 --> 17:40.761
If something goes wrong,
which may happen,

17:40.761 --> 17:43.730
you two just leave the outcome
here at the hospital.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.699
But my dear,

17:45.699 --> 17:50.938
kind, clever, amazing little boy

17:50.938 --> 17:53.006
will be gone.

17:53.006 --> 17:55.342
I will not go home,

17:55.342 --> 18:02.049
for the first time in 14 years,
to be alone, without my son.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.656
It's about control.

18:09.656 --> 18:13.193
She has controlled every waking
moment of that child's life.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.329
For good reason,
to keep him safe.

18:15.329 --> 18:17.030
But now that he has
a will of his own,

18:17.030 --> 18:20.133
she can't seem to let him go.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.202
Well, there's nothing
we can do, is there?

18:22.202 --> 18:25.606
Unfortunately not. We both
know she's not 100% wrong.

18:25.606 --> 18:30.477
The surgery is risky, Marco
is a minor and it is her call.

18:32.746 --> 18:35.115
The resident is falling asleep
while he's retracting,

18:35.115 --> 18:37.284
I'm about to call
the whole thing, and I find

18:37.284 --> 18:39.386
the little nubbin
hiding behind the kidney.

18:39.386 --> 18:42.489
Well, Seattle Children's must
feel so grateful to have you.

18:42.489 --> 18:45.926
Ah. I like to tell myself
they do.

18:45.926 --> 18:47.661
(both laugh)

18:47.661 --> 18:52.900
But I'm thinking of relocating
closer to Cade.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.902
She's my only child.

18:54.902 --> 19:00.107
This has... been a nightmare.

19:00.107 --> 19:01.842
Rearranged all my priorities.

19:01.842 --> 19:04.211
That's understandable.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.780
You know, we're in the market
for a pediatric surgeon.

19:06.780 --> 19:08.715
I don't suppose
you'd consider...

19:08.715 --> 19:10.184
Mm, I'm sorry.

19:10.184 --> 19:11.552
It wasn't my intention
to turn this

19:11.552 --> 19:13.921
-into a job interview.
-No, of course not,

19:13.921 --> 19:15.756
but I'd love to give you

19:15.756 --> 19:18.425
an exclusive CEO tour
of Chastain.

19:18.425 --> 19:21.562
I can reschedule
my next appointment

19:21.562 --> 19:22.629
if you can be available.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.897
Do you have the time?

19:23.897 --> 19:26.333
I have all day.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.135
Great.

19:28.135 --> 19:30.404
Great, thanks for your help.

19:31.138 --> 19:33.407
The patient in 423
needs a PCA pump.

19:33.407 --> 19:34.508
I wrote the order.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.710
How did Cade's first outing
on two feet go?

19:36.710 --> 19:38.712
What outing?

19:38.712 --> 19:39.813
With her father.

19:39.813 --> 19:41.882
Helping her walk
around the hospital?

19:41.882 --> 19:43.016
That didn't happen.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.352
I saw him with Dr. Voss.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.720
Okay.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.994
-What happened?
-I fell.

19:53.994 --> 19:56.930
-(groans) It hurts.
-Laura?

19:56.930 --> 19:58.298
I need a lac tray,

19:58.298 --> 20:00.400
lidocaine with epi and bandages.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.002
CADE:
Feels like my incision opened.

20:02.002 --> 20:05.439
All right,
let's get you back in bed.

20:14.181 --> 20:17.584
Eh, it's a superficial lac.
You're good.

20:27.261 --> 20:31.164
-Where's your dad?
-(laughs softly)

20:32.866 --> 20:34.601
He got a better offer.

20:36.770 --> 20:40.007
Obviously this is complicated.
You don't have to talk about it.

20:40.007 --> 20:42.142
(sighs)
Hurts.

20:42.142 --> 20:47.147
Talking helps take
my mind off of it.

20:47.948 --> 20:49.316
No loss of consciousness?

20:49.316 --> 20:52.486
Nope, I've been painfully awake
this whole time.

20:52.486 --> 20:54.288
-(chuckles)
-No head CT for me.

20:54.288 --> 20:56.223
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

20:56.223 --> 20:59.026
You just focus on keeping
my guts from spilling out.

20:59.026 --> 21:01.028
Ordering me around again?

21:01.028 --> 21:02.696
It's nice to see
you're on the mend.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.598
(laughs softly)

21:04.598 --> 21:06.133
(sighs)

21:19.880 --> 21:21.715
Your hands.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.852
Gentle.

21:25.819 --> 21:30.390
You can always tell how much
a doctor cares by their touch.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.764
I'm so pissed
your dad left you here.

21:37.764 --> 21:41.201
You can count on him
to make a big showy entrance

21:41.201 --> 21:44.471
that gets him
a lot of attention,

21:44.471 --> 21:46.707
but after that...

21:50.110 --> 21:53.146
Look, he does the best he can.

21:53.947 --> 21:56.416
From grade school on,

21:56.416 --> 21:59.887
when I got up in the morning,
he'd be gone to work.

21:59.887 --> 22:02.189
So I made my own lunch.

22:02.189 --> 22:06.627
Did what I had to do,
what I wanted to do.

22:07.594 --> 22:10.063
Made me self-reliant.

22:10.063 --> 22:12.566
I'm grateful for that.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.704
You're being too generous.

22:18.639 --> 22:22.376
Well, not everyone can be
the kind of father you are.

22:25.112 --> 22:28.348
Gigi's a lucky girl.

22:32.519 --> 22:36.023
My dad showed up this week,
he gave blood,

22:36.023 --> 22:38.091
he saved my life.

22:38.091 --> 22:39.860
You got to give credit
where credit's due.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.762
Mm-hmm.

22:43.363 --> 22:48.502
He'll stick around for
a couple days, he'll get bored,

22:48.502 --> 22:52.039
go back home to inappropriate
wife number three,

22:52.039 --> 22:53.774
and Seattle Children's,
where he can see

22:53.774 --> 22:57.578
the hero worship
in his patients' eyes.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.781
Not before I have
a word with him.

23:00.781 --> 23:02.783
(scissors snip)

23:02.783 --> 23:04.418
(grunts softly)

23:12.860 --> 23:14.928
-(monitor beeping rapidly)
-I was gonna ask

23:14.928 --> 23:16.296
if we could take him home.

23:16.296 --> 23:17.631
-He was doing so much better.
-I can't breathe.

23:17.631 --> 23:20.567
He's desatting fast,
his lungs are flooded.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.370
-He's working too hard.
-We need a crash cart now.

23:23.370 --> 23:26.139
Mrs. Anza, we're gonna
have to intubate.

23:26.139 --> 23:27.975
-No. No, no, no.
-His lungs are drowning.

23:27.975 --> 23:30.310
We have no choice.

23:30.310 --> 23:32.513
(wheezing)

23:37.718 --> 23:39.453
Dr. Pravesh, here you will find

23:39.453 --> 23:42.256
our very own
world-class geneticists.

23:42.256 --> 23:43.624
They are making great strides

23:43.624 --> 23:46.126
in the field
of hereditary cancer syndromes,

23:46.126 --> 23:47.327
as well as sequencing

23:47.327 --> 23:50.497
newly discovered
chromosomal disorders.

23:50.497 --> 23:53.700
These are the very experts
in virology.

23:54.902 --> 23:56.703
Is that our rabies protocol?

23:56.703 --> 23:57.804
That's right.

23:57.804 --> 23:58.772
Chastain Rabies Protocol.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.108
Your groundbreaking work.
We're trying to determine

24:01.108 --> 24:03.377
how to trial it
in endemic countries.

24:03.377 --> 24:05.746
Well, you guys
certainly go all out.

24:05.746 --> 24:07.047
We have to.

24:07.047 --> 24:09.416
It's our very center
for rare diseases,

24:09.416 --> 24:11.618
where research
will meet clinical excellence

24:11.618 --> 24:15.556
to cure the most challenging
diseases in the world.

24:18.058 --> 24:21.261
Well, it's a dream setup.

24:21.261 --> 24:24.565
For the, uh, research scientist,
it is.

24:24.565 --> 24:27.501
And we want you
to be a part of it.

24:30.771 --> 24:32.005
(chuckles softly)

24:32.606 --> 24:34.875
Okay, uh, you've got me.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.176
-I'm impressed.
-(laughs)

24:36.176 --> 24:37.578
We certainly hope so.

24:37.578 --> 24:38.712
Because it's all yours.

24:38.712 --> 24:41.748
We want to make you
the director of our program.

24:41.748 --> 24:44.718
You're young for a job
of this stature, it's true.

24:44.718 --> 24:45.586
But...

24:45.586 --> 24:47.788
we feel that you're
the perfect person

24:47.788 --> 24:50.457
to lead us
into a brighter future.

24:52.893 --> 24:54.194
Wow.

24:55.729 --> 24:57.431
I'm...

24:58.065 --> 24:59.800
I'm honored.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.568
Is that a yes?

25:04.705 --> 25:07.007
I need some time
to think about it,

25:07.007 --> 25:08.742
process it all.

25:08.742 --> 25:10.410
Of course.

25:10.410 --> 25:12.946
But we need to know
by next week.

25:12.946 --> 25:15.382
Next week?

25:18.118 --> 25:20.521
(monitor beeping steadily)

25:25.292 --> 25:27.528
You think this was my fault,
don't you?

25:27.528 --> 25:29.863
'Cause I didn't say yes
to the surgery right away.

25:29.863 --> 25:30.998
No.

25:30.998 --> 25:33.300
We're not here to assign blame.

25:33.300 --> 25:37.037
Marco is stable on a vent
for now.

25:38.071 --> 25:40.474
First his heart, now his lungs?

25:40.474 --> 25:42.476
The truth is,
your son is getting worse.

25:42.476 --> 25:44.912
AUSTIN:
His chest deformity
almost stopped

25:44.912 --> 25:46.446
his heart this morning.

25:46.446 --> 25:49.983
Now fluid is backing up
from his heart into his lungs.

25:49.983 --> 25:51.485
We might not be able
to extubate him

25:51.485 --> 25:54.621
ever again if we do not
move forward with the surgery.

25:55.222 --> 25:56.757
-Are you sure?
-BILLIE: Yes.

25:56.757 --> 25:57.958
We have to operate,

25:57.958 --> 25:59.126
and we have to do it today.

25:59.126 --> 26:01.995
There is no option.

26:02.863 --> 26:04.698
(sighs)

26:04.698 --> 26:06.166
Okay.

26:06.166 --> 26:08.335
It is a beautiful hospital.

26:08.335 --> 26:11.305
How does it compare
to Seattle Children's?

26:11.305 --> 26:13.574
(chuckles)
They're very different.

26:13.574 --> 26:15.876
Seattle Children's
isn't a public hospital,

26:15.876 --> 26:18.412
with all the good and bad
that entails.

26:18.412 --> 26:21.248
The best thing about Chastain
is our staff.

26:21.248 --> 26:23.584
We have a roster
of extraordinary doctors.

26:23.584 --> 26:24.751
Mm.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.854
-(phone chimes)
-Excuse me.

26:26.854 --> 26:28.689
And looks like two
of my best surgeons

26:28.689 --> 26:32.159
are about to perform a
Ravitch procedure on a teenager

26:32.159 --> 26:34.628
with a severe case of OI.

26:35.295 --> 26:38.065
I could get you
visitor operating privileges

26:38.065 --> 26:39.132
if you'd like to scrub in.

26:39.132 --> 26:40.400
I'd be delighted.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.436
Let me just go check in
with Cade first.

26:42.436 --> 26:44.238
Meet me at OR 2.

26:44.238 --> 26:45.639
Right.

26:46.507 --> 26:48.375
Yeah. How's my girl?

26:48.375 --> 26:50.777
Uh...

26:50.777 --> 26:52.145
not great.

26:52.145 --> 26:53.313
-She fell and hit her head.
-What?

26:53.313 --> 26:55.482
-And opened her sutures.
-How?

26:55.482 --> 26:58.118
Because she decided
to walk by herself.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.152
Where were you?

26:59.152 --> 27:00.554
I'll go check in on her now.

27:00.554 --> 27:02.456
Uh, you're a little late.

27:03.056 --> 27:04.091
She's asleep.

27:04.091 --> 27:05.826
She should've waited for me.

27:05.826 --> 27:08.795
She's always done things
on her own,

27:08.795 --> 27:10.797
without support.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.132
Okay.

27:12.132 --> 27:14.234
Look, I feel bad enough.

27:14.234 --> 27:16.103
I don't need a lecture.

27:16.103 --> 27:17.371
And for the record,

27:17.371 --> 27:18.805
-do you know where I was?
-I don't care.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.474
I was asked to scrub in
on a life-threatening surgery

27:20.474 --> 27:22.142
on a teen, okay?

27:22.142 --> 27:23.477
Chastain has
no pediatric surgeon.

27:23.477 --> 27:25.112
I may be able
to help save a life.

27:25.112 --> 27:27.881
Oh, we have plenty
of great surgeons.

27:27.881 --> 27:29.616
Your daughter needed you.

27:29.616 --> 27:31.351
Why don't you just say it?

27:31.351 --> 27:33.253
I'm in your way.

27:33.253 --> 27:35.822
You want to have Cade
all to yourself.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.124
I'm her doctor.

27:37.124 --> 27:38.926
So, yeah, right now,
you are in my way.

27:38.926 --> 27:40.227
And I'm her father.

27:40.227 --> 27:42.696
Then start acting like it.

27:50.904 --> 27:52.039
(groans softly)

27:54.875 --> 27:57.611
(elevator dings, doors open)

27:59.680 --> 28:01.715
♪

28:06.620 --> 28:07.621
You okay?

28:07.621 --> 28:10.357
Good. Good. Just doing
my little pre-op stretch.

28:10.357 --> 28:13.026
-(chuckles)
-Time to get changed
and scrub in.

28:13.026 --> 28:15.195
I'll show you
to the locker room.

28:15.996 --> 28:17.531
(door opens)

28:17.531 --> 28:19.366
Dr. Austin, Dr. Sutton,

28:19.366 --> 28:22.536
this is Cade's father,
Dr. Sullivan.

28:22.536 --> 28:24.805
He's visiting his daughter
and happens to be

28:24.805 --> 28:25.906
a top pediatric surgeon,

28:25.906 --> 28:28.175
something Chastain lacks.

28:28.175 --> 28:29.943
Just here to watch and learn.

28:29.943 --> 28:32.112
Yeah, well, this is a big one.

28:32.112 --> 28:33.447
It's high-stakes.

28:33.447 --> 28:34.848
Got a life to save.

28:34.848 --> 28:36.650
BILLIE:
Happy to have you scrub in.

28:36.650 --> 28:38.452
Delighted.

28:41.722 --> 28:43.724
(buzzing)

28:47.494 --> 28:48.462
AUSTIN:
All right.

28:48.462 --> 28:50.030
That should give
his heart and lungs

28:50.030 --> 28:51.532
room to breathe.

28:51.532 --> 28:54.168
Very delicately done.

28:54.168 --> 28:56.170
I-I do have one suggestion.

28:56.170 --> 28:58.372
If you're open to it.

28:58.372 --> 28:59.640
I'd recommend

28:59.640 --> 29:01.909
overcorrecting the sternum
just a little bit more.

29:01.909 --> 29:03.210
It may look silly now,

29:03.210 --> 29:04.878
but when you go to secure

29:04.878 --> 29:07.314
the pectoralis muscles
back down, it'll...

29:07.314 --> 29:09.216
it'll make sure that
the sternum doesn't dip back

29:09.216 --> 29:11.652
into dangerous territory.

29:15.322 --> 29:18.592
That's actually
an excellent suggestion.

29:18.592 --> 29:19.593
Huh.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.128
I like that.
(laughs)

29:21.128 --> 29:23.997
In fact, I will make
that adjustment right now.

29:23.997 --> 29:25.732
Rongeurs to me.

29:27.367 --> 29:29.002
BILLIE:
Take it you've done
a few of these?

29:29.002 --> 29:31.205
Just a few.

29:31.205 --> 29:32.639
Dozen.

29:33.774 --> 29:36.009
-(monitors beeping rapidly)
-BILLIE: BP's plummeting.

29:36.009 --> 29:37.211
He's tachycardic.

29:37.211 --> 29:39.146
IAN:
And has severe JVD.

29:39.146 --> 29:40.380
AUSTIN:
Uh, high-output

29:40.380 --> 29:41.882
cardiac failure.

29:41.882 --> 29:42.950
Hang dobutamine.

29:42.950 --> 29:44.017
Five mics per kilo.

29:44.017 --> 29:45.252
He's in V tach.

29:45.252 --> 29:47.754
And he's likely ruptured
the aortic aneurysm.

29:47.754 --> 29:48.856
Laps to me.

29:48.856 --> 29:50.924
We need to get a bypass
in here now.

29:50.924 --> 29:52.659
Dr. Cade's father,

29:52.659 --> 29:54.695
step in. We need your hands.

29:54.695 --> 29:55.729
By all means.

29:55.729 --> 29:57.431
AUSTIN:
So, the aneurysm involved

29:57.431 --> 29:59.766
the ascending aorta
and the arch.

29:59.766 --> 30:02.503
IAN:
And the descending aorta.

30:02.503 --> 30:05.405
Time for the frozen
elephant trunk technique,

30:05.405 --> 30:06.607
wouldn't you say?

30:06.607 --> 30:08.609
I've only done that in adults.

30:08.609 --> 30:10.511
IAN:
Works in kids, too.

30:11.678 --> 30:12.713
We good?

30:13.747 --> 30:15.015
Hell yeah.

30:15.015 --> 30:16.650
Ah, let's do it.

30:16.650 --> 30:17.618
(laughs)

30:17.618 --> 30:18.986
<i>BELL:</i>
<i>Wow, he's good.</i>

30:18.986 --> 30:20.153
<i>KIT:</i>
<i>No kidding.</i>

30:20.153 --> 30:22.322
We do need a peds surgeon.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.424
Yes, we do.

30:24.424 --> 30:27.361
So have you broached the subject
with Sullivan?

30:27.361 --> 30:29.563
I did.

30:30.531 --> 30:31.465
But?

30:31.465 --> 30:33.000
He's very charming,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.269
and he turns it on effortlessly.

30:35.269 --> 30:37.738
Maybe a little too effortlessly.

30:38.472 --> 30:42.576
But those hands
would save a lot of young lives.

30:43.377 --> 30:44.645
(chuckles)

30:44.645 --> 30:45.979
I wouldn't worry about it.

30:45.979 --> 30:48.582
Ian Sullivan
will be putty in yours.

30:49.149 --> 30:51.285
Darling, are you all right?

30:51.285 --> 30:52.753
I'm just pushing myself
a bit too hard.

30:52.753 --> 30:55.522
I had a podcast interview
about unaccountable doctors,

30:55.522 --> 30:57.658
then a deposition where
I testified about the cases

30:57.658 --> 30:59.293
that were ignored
by the state medical board.

30:59.293 --> 31:00.861
Then I came back here
and did a lap chole,

31:00.861 --> 31:02.262
which I should have delegated
to Nolan

31:02.262 --> 31:04.064
but I didn't
because I missed the OR

31:04.064 --> 31:05.132
-and...
-Can you go home

31:05.132 --> 31:07.301
-and rest now?
-Uh...

31:07.301 --> 31:10.671
No, I would need somebody
to cover for a bowel resection.

31:10.671 --> 31:11.505
Nolan can do it.

31:11.505 --> 31:14.241
Or Leela.
Your health is our priority.

31:14.241 --> 31:15.475
Now go.

31:17.978 --> 31:20.447
(door opens, closes)

31:29.089 --> 31:30.490
How'd it go?

31:30.490 --> 31:32.893
How'd what go?

31:32.893 --> 31:35.596
The job interview.

31:39.366 --> 31:41.068
So you heard?

31:41.068 --> 31:43.604
-(door closes)
-Everyone heard.

31:43.604 --> 31:45.372
Everyone's talking about it.

31:45.372 --> 31:48.208
Everyone's afraid you'll leave.

31:50.978 --> 31:53.080
They offered me a job.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.549
An entire department, actually.

31:55.549 --> 31:59.753
I'd be running their new center
for rare diseases.

32:02.022 --> 32:03.156
It's a dream.
(chuckles softly)

32:03.156 --> 32:06.560
Devon, that's-that's incredible.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.828
(chuckling softly)

32:07.828 --> 32:09.730
You must be really proud.

32:10.764 --> 32:12.165
Thank you.

32:13.934 --> 32:15.702
So are you gonna take it?

32:20.908 --> 32:22.009
(sighs)

32:22.009 --> 32:24.578
Do you think I should?

32:25.479 --> 32:28.615
I can't make
that decision for you.

32:32.219 --> 32:35.122
Is there anything left of us?

32:35.122 --> 32:37.391
That's on you.

32:37.991 --> 32:39.526
You're the one who made it clear

32:39.526 --> 32:41.361
that not having kids
was a deal-breaker.

32:41.361 --> 32:44.198
I think the deal-breaker
is that you didn't even discuss

32:44.198 --> 32:46.066
my feelings about it.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.869
You just laid out your rules.

32:48.869 --> 32:50.370
Your job,

32:50.370 --> 32:52.306
your body, your eggs,
your future.

32:52.306 --> 32:53.807
Mine didn't even factor in.

32:53.807 --> 32:57.077
And that's not what our
relationship was supposed to be.

32:58.245 --> 33:00.714
It was supposed to be
a partnership.

33:01.381 --> 33:03.550
You've already made up
your mind.

33:03.550 --> 33:06.386
And now you're just justifying
your decision by blaming me

33:06.386 --> 33:08.288
for the fact
that you're leaving your friends

33:08.288 --> 33:10.324
and the hospital that made you.

33:10.324 --> 33:13.126
I can't believe you'd do that.

33:19.433 --> 33:21.168
(door opens)

33:21.902 --> 33:24.171
(knocking on door)

33:31.879 --> 33:34.681
Kincaid, my darling.
(sighs)

33:34.681 --> 33:36.450
I'm so sorry.

33:37.150 --> 33:39.520
Heard you were the hero
of the day.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.388
I guest-starred
in a roller-coaster

33:41.388 --> 33:44.424
Ravitch procedure
with Drs. Austin and Sutton,

33:44.424 --> 33:46.493
but hardly a hero.

33:46.493 --> 33:50.097
I left you waiting for me,
and you did what you always do

33:50.097 --> 33:54.268
the way you've always done it:
on your own.

33:54.268 --> 33:55.669
There was a kid who needed you.

33:55.669 --> 33:58.772
Work to be done.
There's nothing new to see here.

33:58.772 --> 34:00.741
Yes, there is.

34:00.741 --> 34:02.409
You needed me.

34:02.409 --> 34:04.778
Nothing should have taken
precedence over that.

34:04.778 --> 34:09.650
Dad, we have a long history
of other kids taking precedence.

34:09.650 --> 34:11.752
But I'm over it.

34:11.752 --> 34:13.654
I'm a doctor, too.

34:13.654 --> 34:16.990
I've let hospital drama
suffocate my personal life

34:16.990 --> 34:19.092
more times than I can count.

34:22.663 --> 34:27.034
Remember when you were
the lead in the school play,

34:27.034 --> 34:31.405
and opening night,
I-I sent you roses

34:31.405 --> 34:34.208
-and then didn't show up.
-Yeah, sure.

34:34.208 --> 34:36.410
There's no need to rehash that.

34:36.410 --> 34:39.646
And today I brought you
banana pudding.

34:40.614 --> 34:42.316
People don't change, do they?

34:42.316 --> 34:46.653
I keep making the same mistakes
again and again.

34:46.653 --> 34:48.055
What's going on?

34:48.055 --> 34:49.756
What do you mean?

34:49.756 --> 34:51.692
I sense an agenda.

34:51.692 --> 34:54.761
Humble pie is not your dessert.

34:54.761 --> 34:56.196
(laughs softly)

34:59.032 --> 35:01.502
Kit Voss offered me a job.

35:01.502 --> 35:05.239
Why would you leave
Seattle Children's?

35:05.239 --> 35:08.075
-Were you fired?
-No.

35:08.075 --> 35:11.445
Look, I saw you pocket
the benzos.

35:11.445 --> 35:13.580
You're not having
an issue with that again?

35:13.580 --> 35:15.816
No, I have this pain in my back,
it wraps around my side,

35:15.816 --> 35:18.118
-keeps me up at night.
-Well, have you seen a doctor?

35:18.118 --> 35:20.087
Of course not.
It's just a muscle pull.

35:20.087 --> 35:21.555
It's nothing, it's fine.

35:21.555 --> 35:24.758
Look, I won't... I won't make
a habit of the pills.

35:24.758 --> 35:27.160
But at my age, you know,
I'm not getting any younger.

35:27.160 --> 35:29.162
Aches and pains
are a common thing.

35:29.162 --> 35:31.298
Dad, you're barely 60.

35:31.298 --> 35:34.668
Hey, hey, 59.
(chuckles)

35:37.037 --> 35:39.339
I'm considering
coming to Chastain

35:39.339 --> 35:41.675
so that I can be closer to you.

35:43.710 --> 35:45.445
Oh, my God.

35:46.713 --> 35:48.882
Louisa left you.

35:48.882 --> 35:50.450
No.

35:50.450 --> 35:53.420
Why do you always think
the worst of me?

35:56.323 --> 35:57.658
I left her.

36:00.561 --> 36:03.297
And now you need a whole new
crop of people to charm.

36:03.297 --> 36:06.466
-Ouch.
-So you arrived to save me,

36:06.466 --> 36:09.503
and then you managed to line it
up with an agenda of your own.

36:09.503 --> 36:13.173
(laughs):
No, no. I did come to save you.

36:13.173 --> 36:16.176
The "agenda"
came after I realized

36:16.176 --> 36:19.680
that I wanted to be with you
from now on.

36:22.549 --> 36:27.187
I really did drop everything
to come and save you.

36:27.187 --> 36:30.424
And in return, you rip
my heart out. (chuckles)

36:34.628 --> 36:38.532
-I'll come back later.
-IAN: No, no, it's fine.

36:39.099 --> 36:41.034
I'm leaving.

36:42.836 --> 36:44.638
For good.

36:54.715 --> 36:56.416
You okay?

36:57.251 --> 36:58.719
No.

37:11.198 --> 37:12.666
Bye.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.103
Well, not a bad day overall.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.272
We saved a life,
and the young man

37:18.272 --> 37:20.274
actually has a chance
at a real future.

37:20.274 --> 37:22.042
And he might be
one of the lucky ones

37:22.042 --> 37:23.343
whose OI goes into remission.

37:23.343 --> 37:25.345
That'd be icing on the cake.

37:25.345 --> 37:27.581
There's just one last hurdle
for Marco.

37:27.581 --> 37:29.449
Oh, he'll have his work
cut out for him getting his mom

37:29.449 --> 37:32.452
-to let him grow up.
-(exhales sharply)

37:35.189 --> 37:38.025
-(sighs)
-AUSTIN: Hey.

37:38.025 --> 37:39.860
What's going on?

37:40.861 --> 37:43.964
Oh, lately, I've been
a little disappointed in myself.

37:43.964 --> 37:46.767
Really? You?

37:46.767 --> 37:51.405
I'm afraid to do what
that kid was willing to do.

37:52.239 --> 37:55.175
You know, take a big risk
for a larger life.

37:56.009 --> 37:57.744
Listen to me.

37:59.313 --> 38:01.548
After everything
you have been through,

38:01.548 --> 38:02.716
I can honestly say

38:02.716 --> 38:06.286
you are one of the most
courageous women I know.

38:06.286 --> 38:09.990
And you've got nerves of steel
in the OR.

38:09.990 --> 38:12.626
-Well, thank you.
-You're welcome.

38:14.261 --> 38:15.762
But here's the thing.

38:18.198 --> 38:22.135
I haven't been in
a significant relationship in...

38:22.135 --> 38:24.438
I don't know, a long time.

38:25.105 --> 38:27.241
For a lot of reasons.

38:27.241 --> 38:30.143
You know, my past, obviously.

38:31.545 --> 38:34.147
But now I've gone
and fallen for someone...

38:35.215 --> 38:37.718
...who I won't identify...

38:39.620 --> 38:42.656
...and there are huge
potential complications.

38:42.656 --> 38:46.193
Don't tell me you're afraid
the guy's gonna say no.

38:46.193 --> 38:49.429
Because that seems
inconceivable.

38:50.330 --> 38:54.368
I'm as afraid he'll say yes
as I am he'll say no.

38:55.802 --> 38:58.338
Ugh, it's all terrifying.

38:58.338 --> 39:00.807
(chuckles)

39:00.807 --> 39:04.077
Yeah. I get it.

39:04.077 --> 39:06.980
You know, honestly?

39:06.980 --> 39:09.650
I'm terrified of
becoming a father.

39:09.650 --> 39:13.220
You know, just the way
it's all happening, right?

39:13.220 --> 39:15.989
And Padma is loosey-goosey

39:15.989 --> 39:19.326
and I am not.

39:19.326 --> 39:21.929
You know what I was thinking?

39:21.929 --> 39:24.464
What if the kid doesn't love me?

39:25.098 --> 39:28.335
There's not a chance
of that, AJ.

39:28.335 --> 39:30.370
Hey.

39:30.370 --> 39:33.574
Conrad and Gigi would
be lucky to have you.

39:37.411 --> 39:39.079
(Billie sighs)

39:39.079 --> 39:41.114
Is it that obvious?

39:41.114 --> 39:43.317
Maybe not to Conrad.

39:43.317 --> 39:45.385
Billie.

39:45.385 --> 39:48.422
Go tell the man how you feel.

40:04.304 --> 40:07.641
You know what?
Slight detour before home.

40:07.641 --> 40:11.712
I have a top secret mission,
should you choose to accept it.

40:11.712 --> 40:13.947
What is it?

40:14.748 --> 40:17.718
Someone I know needs a hug,
and they're right over there.

40:19.319 --> 40:21.588
I'm a really good hugger.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.690
And so is Mr. Waffles.

40:23.690 --> 40:26.059
Then you two are
the perfect people for the job.

40:26.059 --> 40:29.029
All right, follow me.

40:49.249 --> 40:51.418
What happened to your head?

40:51.418 --> 40:53.420
I got a boo-boo.

40:53.420 --> 40:56.657
Want Mr. Waffles
to kiss it and make it better?

40:56.657 --> 41:00.194
And I could also give you
a kiss if you wanted me to.

41:00.194 --> 41:03.463
Yes, please.
Both would be great.

41:06.567 --> 41:10.337
Mr. Waffles is your
new best friend, huh?
