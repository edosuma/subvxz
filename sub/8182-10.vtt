00:31.680 --> 00:33.914
MORNING, DOUGLAS.

00:33.982 --> 00:37.168
WHAT YOU GOT GOING ON THERE,
GREASED LIGHTNING?

00:37.236 --> 00:39.487
IT HAPPENS TO BE
CALLED STYLE.

00:39.555 --> 00:42.957
AS THE ENTERTAINMENT
DIRECTOR AT THE SENIOR CENTER,

00:43.025 --> 00:46.294
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
I MAINTAIN A CERTAIN IMAGE.

00:46.361 --> 00:48.946
<i>WELL, IF YOU'RE TRYING
FOR THE STUART LITTLE LOOK,</i>

00:49.014 --> 00:51.015
YOU NAILED IT.

00:51.083 --> 00:54.202
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOUR
LITTLE GIBES GET TO ME, DOUGLAS,

00:54.269 --> 00:58.606
BECAUSE I JUST BOOKED ONE OF
THE GREATEST SINGERS OF ALL TIME-

00:58.674 --> 01:00.841
AVA ST. CLAIR.

01:00.909 --> 01:02.026
WHO?

01:02.094 --> 01:03.377
AVA ST. CLAIR,

01:03.445 --> 01:05.379
THE YOUNGEST OF
THE ST. CLAIR SISTERS!

01:05.447 --> 01:09.350
OH, THE YOUNGEST,
YEAH, NEVER HEARD OF HER.

01:09.418 --> 01:11.536
OF COURSE YOU HAVE.

01:11.603 --> 01:13.071
REMEMBER HER BIG HIT?

01:13.139 --> 01:14.572
MY CANDY STORE'S CLOSED

01:14.640 --> 01:16.074
THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE

01:20.646 --> 01:22.880
STILL NOTHING.

01:22.948 --> 01:27.135
HERMIONE GINGOLD DID A
HILARIOUS PARODY VERSION!

01:27.203 --> 01:28.786
OK, STOP SAYING NAMES
I NEVER HEARD,

01:28.854 --> 01:32.373
AND YOU'RE NOT USING THOSE
BREATH STRIPS I GAVE YOU, ARE YOU?

01:32.441 --> 01:34.826
DEACON, WHAT'S THE FIRST
THING YOU THINK OF

01:34.894 --> 01:38.296
WHEN I SAY,
"LICK MY LOLLIPOP"?

01:38.363 --> 01:41.766
UM...

01:41.833 --> 01:43.034
NO.

01:45.838 --> 01:46.938
HEY, I GRABBED
YOUR MAIL FOR YOU.

01:47.006 --> 01:49.757
OH, THANKS.

01:52.794 --> 01:54.529
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

01:54.597 --> 01:55.563
"WE ARE PLEASED
TO INFORM YOU

01:55.631 --> 01:56.864
"THAT YOUR APARTMENT
IN STUYVESANT TOWERS

01:56.932 --> 01:58.099
"HAS BECOME AVAILABLE.

01:58.166 --> 02:02.002
YOU HAVE 30 DAYS FROM THE
ABOVE DATE TO RESPOND."

02:02.070 --> 02:03.438
YOU GUYS MOVING
TO MANHATTAN?

02:03.505 --> 02:05.005
NO.

02:05.073 --> 02:08.008
OH, MY GOD.

02:08.077 --> 02:10.612
THIS IS FROM WHEN, LIKE,
WE FIRST GOT MARRIED.

02:12.715 --> 02:13.965
YEAH,
IT'S A ONE-BEDROOM,

02:14.116 --> 02:15.283
LAUNDRY'S IN
THE BASEMENT,

02:15.350 --> 02:16.934
AND YOU GET
FULL DOORMAN SERVICE.

02:18.270 --> 02:19.404
LET ME JUST TAKE THIS.

02:19.471 --> 02:21.005
FEEL FREE
TO LOOK AROUND.

02:21.073 --> 02:22.140
THIS IS BURT.

02:23.442 --> 02:24.976
HOW GREAT IS THIS?

02:25.044 --> 02:26.711
AND I THINK IT'S SOME KIND
OF RENT CONTROL-Y THING,

02:26.778 --> 02:29.180
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY
AFFORD IT.

02:29.248 --> 02:30.732
YEAH, IT'S JUST
KINDA SMALL, ISN'T IT?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.433
YES, OF COURSE IT IS.
IT'S MANHATTAN.

02:32.501 --> 02:33.601
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:33.669 --> 02:36.037
WE'RE RIGHT ACROSS
THE STREET FROM THE PARK.

02:36.105 --> 02:37.438
AND YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO START TRAINING

02:37.506 --> 02:38.506
FOR YOUR MARATHON, RIGHT?

02:38.573 --> 02:39.707
YEAH, IT'S 3 WEEKS AWAY,

02:39.775 --> 02:41.843
I DON'T WANT
TO PEAK TOO EARLY.

02:41.910 --> 02:42.843
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
THEY DO IN THE PARK?

02:42.911 --> 02:45.446
THEY HAVE THIS WHOLE
SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL.

02:45.514 --> 02:47.131
I MEAN, WE COULD WATCH IT
FROM OUR WINDOW!

02:47.199 --> 02:49.083
CARRIE, YOU KNOW ME,
I'M ALL OVER SHAKESPEARE,

02:49.151 --> 02:50.852
BUT WOULDN'T IT BE
MORE PRACTICAL

02:50.920 --> 02:52.620
TO GET A PLACE
OUT IN QUEENS?

02:52.688 --> 02:55.122
THIS WAY WE HAVE A HOUSE,
WE GOT OUR YARD.

02:55.190 --> 02:56.207
YOU KNOW, WE'LL BE
NEAR OUR FRIENDS.

02:56.275 --> 02:57.576
WE CAN GET A DOG WITH,
LIKE, HALF A TAIL.

02:57.643 --> 02:59.410
I ALWAYS FEEL BAD
FOR THOSE GUYS.

02:59.478 --> 03:01.429
COME ON, LET'S GO
CHECK OUT THE BEDROOM.

03:04.817 --> 03:06.885
MAN, SHE'S REALLY GOT A
THING FOR LIVING IN THE CITY.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.920
WELL, I SHOULD TELL YOU
THIS UNIT'S RENTED,

03:08.987 --> 03:11.723
AND THE WAITING LIST FOR
THIS BUILDING IS PRETTY LONG.

03:11.791 --> 03:13.758
HOW LONG?

03:13.826 --> 03:16.261
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
COULD BE 5, 10 YEARS.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.696
WHO KNOWS?

03:17.763 --> 03:19.097
REALLY?

03:24.052 --> 03:25.770
SO, YOU REALLY
WANT THIS, HUH?

03:25.837 --> 03:30.225
YEAH, IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN MY DREAM.

03:30.292 --> 03:34.229
WELL, THEN I SAY
WE DO IT.

03:34.296 --> 03:36.530
REALLY? YOU WOULD
DO THIS FOR ME?

03:36.598 --> 03:39.117
CARRIE,
YOU'RE MY WIFE NOW.

03:39.184 --> 03:43.288
SO, THAT MEANS
YOUR DREAM IS MY DREAM.

03:45.291 --> 03:48.910
<i>GOD, MY DAD WAS
SO WRONG ABOUT YOU.</i>

03:51.180 --> 03:53.848
SO, BASICALLY, YOU LIED TO
THE PERSON YOU LOVE MOST.

03:53.916 --> 03:58.586
AND GOT REWARDED. WE
WENT TO K.F.C. THAT NIGHT.

04:01.123 --> 04:02.373
GOD, THAT'S CARRIE.

04:02.441 --> 04:04.142
I'D BETTER NOT
LET HER SEE THIS.

04:04.209 --> 04:05.410
WHY NOT?

04:05.478 --> 04:06.711
BECAUSE SHE NEVER REALLY GOT
OVER THE WHOLE MANHATTAN THING

04:06.778 --> 04:08.113
AND I DON'T WANT TO GET HER
ALL REVVED UP AGAIN.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.180
WELL, HOW CAN YOU
DO IT ANYWAYS?

04:09.248 --> 04:10.915
IT'S A ONE BEDROOM
AND YOU GOT ARTHUR.

04:10.983 --> 04:13.718
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:13.786 --> 04:16.754
I FORGOT ABOUT
THE CRAZY OLD MAN.

04:17.790 --> 04:18.672
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:18.791 --> 04:19.991
I BET YOU
I COULD USE THIS,

04:20.058 --> 04:21.776
<i>GET A LITTLE
EXTRA CREDIT,</i>

04:21.844 --> 04:23.995
AND MAYBE A RETURN TRIP
TO K.F.C.

04:26.365 --> 04:27.448
OH, YOU GOT THE MAIL.
YEAH.

04:27.516 --> 04:29.817
YEAH, IT'S JUST NOTHING
BUT BILLS, BILLS, BILLS,

04:29.885 --> 04:30.885
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

04:33.088 --> 04:34.722
OH, WHAT IS THIS?

04:36.475 --> 04:38.810
STUYVESANT TOWERS?

04:38.877 --> 04:39.944
OH, MY GOSH, CARRIE,

04:40.012 --> 04:40.945
YOU REMEMBER
THAT APARTMENT IN THE CITY

04:41.013 --> 04:42.514
WE SIGNED UP FOR YEARS AGO?

04:42.581 --> 04:43.848
UH-HUH.

04:43.915 --> 04:45.749
WELL, IT'S AVAILABLE.
MAN...

04:45.817 --> 04:46.750
WHAT?

04:46.818 --> 04:49.454
YEAH.

04:49.521 --> 04:51.856
OH, MY GOD, I TOTALLY
FORGOT ABOUT THIS.

04:51.923 --> 04:53.724
YEAH, ME TOO.

04:55.144 --> 04:58.296
YOU DON'T WANT
TO MOVE TO THE CITY, RIGHT?

04:58.364 --> 05:01.966
I DON'T KNOW, MAN,
IT IS YOUR DREAM, RIGHT?

05:04.003 --> 05:05.236
YEAH.

05:05.287 --> 05:09.190
WELL, LIKE 10 YEARS AGO
I SAID, YOU KNOW,

05:09.257 --> 05:10.858
WHATEVER YOUR DREAM IS,

05:10.926 --> 05:14.662
IS MY DREAM, TOO.

05:14.729 --> 05:16.947
YOU WOULD DO THIS?

05:17.015 --> 05:21.135
LOOK, DO I LOVE LIVING
IN QUEENS? YEAH.

05:21.203 --> 05:24.805
DO I LOVE YOU MORE?
YOU BETCHA.

05:24.873 --> 05:28.609
SO, I'M GOING TO CALL RIGHT
NOW AND RESERVE IT, OK?

05:28.677 --> 05:31.395
I CAN'T THINK
OF ANY REASON WHY NOT.

05:32.581 --> 05:35.650
I MEAN, CAN YOU?

05:35.717 --> 05:37.886
NO!

05:37.953 --> 05:40.521
OK, LET'S DO IT!

05:40.588 --> 05:43.724
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU
IN THE CAR.

05:43.792 --> 05:45.276
AH, LET ME SEE THAT.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.945
I
- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT FORGETTING,

05:48.013 --> 05:49.880
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING OR

05:49.948 --> 05:53.851
<i>SOMEBODY.</i>

05:53.919 --> 05:56.337
OH, MY-MY DAD.
WE CAN'T DO IT.

05:56.404 --> 05:57.705
IT'S A ONE-BEDROOM.

05:57.772 --> 06:00.008
GOD, GUT-PUNCH.

06:00.075 --> 06:04.228
WELL, THAT WAS EXCITING
FOR ABOUT 2 SECONDS.

06:05.697 --> 06:07.665
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'LL JUST CALL THEM LATER

06:07.733 --> 06:09.250
AND TELL THEM
TO TAKE US OFF THE LIST.

06:09.318 --> 06:11.352
I'M SO SORRY, BABE.

06:11.420 --> 06:12.687
THAT'S OK, YOU TRIED.

06:12.754 --> 06:15.356
I DID TRY.

06:15.424 --> 06:16.157
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:16.308 --> 06:18.376
TONIGHT, I SAY WE GET
US SOME COMFORT FOOD.

06:18.443 --> 06:21.162
YES!
PICK US UP SOME SUSHI.

06:29.121 --> 06:30.922
I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,
MISS ST. CLAIR,

06:30.989 --> 06:31.923
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

06:31.990 --> 06:33.591
WE'RE RUNNING
A FEW MINUTES BEHIND.

06:33.659 --> 06:37.311
NOTHING MAJOR. OUR SOUND
MAN'S SUFFERING CHEST PAINS.

06:37.379 --> 06:39.613
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I'M NOT GOING ON.

06:39.681 --> 06:41.215
WHAT?

06:41.283 --> 06:42.716
BUT WE HAVE
A FULL HOUSE.

06:42.784 --> 06:43.601
SEND THEM HOME.

06:43.668 --> 06:46.870
NOBODY WANTS TO SEE
SOME HORRIBLE, AGING DIVA.

06:46.938 --> 06:49.590
YOU'RE NOT HORRIBLE,
YOU'RE AVA ST. CLAIR!

06:49.657 --> 06:54.729
NO, I'M NOT. I AM ESTHER
LEVINE FROM BROOKLYN.

06:54.796 --> 06:56.764
I DON'T KNOW.
WHO AM I FOOLING?

06:56.832 --> 06:58.099
I SHOULD'VE RETIRED
YEARS AGO,

06:58.167 --> 07:01.002
WHEN I COULD STILL
SING WORTH A DAMN.

07:01.070 --> 07:06.441
AND WHY DIDN'T I MARRY VIC
DAMONE WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE?

07:06.508 --> 07:09.743
MISS ST. CLAIR, CAN I
TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY?

07:09.811 --> 07:13.197
I DON'T CARE.

07:13.265 --> 07:15.833
THE YEAR WAS 1962,

07:15.900 --> 07:18.669
AND MY PENCIL ERASER BUSINESS
HAD JUST GONE BELLY-UP.

07:18.737 --> 07:20.971
PENS HAD BECOME
ALL THE RAGE.

07:21.039 --> 07:22.173
I WAS FLAT BROKE,

07:22.240 --> 07:24.108
MY FIANCÃ‰E LEFT ME,

07:24.176 --> 07:25.943
I DIDN'T WANT
TO LIVE ANYMORE.

07:26.011 --> 07:28.762
WELL, YOU'RE STILL HERE,
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

07:28.830 --> 07:33.150
I WAS IN HORN AND HARDART'S,
HAVING A CUP OF HOT WATER AND LEMON.

07:33.218 --> 07:37.054
SUDDENLY A SONG
CAME ON THE RADIO.

07:46.414 --> 07:50.100
IT GAVE ME
THE WILL TO GO ON.

07:50.168 --> 07:52.786
WHAT, MY SONG
SAVED YOUR LIFE?

07:52.854 --> 07:54.938
YES, AND I ALSO REALIZED

07:55.006 --> 07:56.940
I COULDN'T OFF MYSELF
IF I WANTED TO,

07:57.008 --> 07:58.476
I'M VERY MUCH A COWARD.

08:00.362 --> 08:01.462
SPOONER,

08:01.530 --> 08:04.632
THE CONCESSION STAND IS
ALMOST OUT OF PUDDING.

08:04.700 --> 08:07.969
WE'RE ABOUT 5 MINUTES FROM
THIS PLACE TURNING INTO ATTICA.

08:10.038 --> 08:11.672
WELL, CUE THE BAND!

08:11.740 --> 08:14.541
AVA ST. CLAIR IS
IN THE HOUSE!

08:22.067 --> 08:25.286
WHOO!
OH, YEAH!

08:25.354 --> 08:26.337
YOU CAN'T STOP ME,

08:26.438 --> 08:28.289
YOU CAN ONLY HOPE
TO CONTAIN ME!

08:28.357 --> 08:30.674
19-ZIP.

08:30.742 --> 08:32.342
Y- YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:32.410 --> 08:35.011
YOU-YOU AND DEACON
VERSUS US ISN'T FAIR, MAN.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.347
YOU DIDN'T HEAR US CRYING WHEN
YOU KICKED OUR ASS AT PICTIONARY.

08:40.102 --> 08:40.933
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

08:41.003 --> 08:43.669
AT LEAST GIVE US
AN ASTHMA BREAK.

08:43.738 --> 08:45.256
YOU GOT 40 SECONDS.

08:51.162 --> 08:53.598
SO, WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT
WHOLE, UH, APARTMENT THING?

08:53.665 --> 08:55.933
OH, IT'S DEAD.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.035
THANKS TO ARTHUR, I'M
STAYING RIGHT HERE IN QUEENS.

08:58.103 --> 09:00.304
WHAT? CARRIE WANTS
TO MOVE?

09:00.371 --> 09:01.873
YEAH.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.991
I GOT THE SAME PROBLEM
WITH PUDGY.

09:04.059 --> 09:06.961
OK, WOULD SOMEONE
TELL LORD DIPWAD

09:07.029 --> 09:08.946
THAT BUYING A HOUSE

09:09.013 --> 09:10.748
IS A SOUND
FINANCIAL INVESTMENT?

09:10.816 --> 09:12.650
Y
- YOU PAY RENT, YOU'RE JUST THROWING MONEY DOWN A RAT HOLE.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.803
YEAH, W-WELL, SO IS SPENDING
$1,000 ON MASSAGE SCHOOL.

09:15.871 --> 09:18.939
OH, WELL, I DIDN'T HEAR YOUR
FEET COMPLAINING LAST NIGHT.

09:40.045 --> 09:42.012
THANK YOU!

09:42.080 --> 09:43.398
OH, I THINK
THEY LIKED ME,

09:43.465 --> 09:44.949
THEY REALLY LIKED ME.

09:45.016 --> 09:48.753
LIKED YOU? IF THEY HAD THEIR
TEETH IN, THEY'D EAT YOU ALIVE.

09:48.821 --> 09:52.823
OH, AND ARTHUR, I COULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

09:52.891 --> 09:54.292
I MEAN IT.

09:54.359 --> 09:56.994
YOU WERE THE WIND
BENEATH MY WINGS.

09:57.061 --> 10:01.332
IMAGINE THAT.
I'M AVA ST. CLAIR'S WIND.

10:01.399 --> 10:04.735
YOU KNOW, ARTHUR,
I'VE BEEN LOOKING

10:04.803 --> 10:08.739
FOR SOMEBODY TO, UH, HELP
ME WITH THE REST OF MY TOUR.

10:08.807 --> 10:10.307
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED?

10:10.375 --> 10:11.642
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

10:11.710 --> 10:13.344
OH, OBVIOUSLY
I WOULD PAY YOU.

10:13.412 --> 10:17.265
NONSENSE! WORKING WITH AVA ST.
CLAIR WOULD BE PAYMENT ENOUGH.

10:17.332 --> 10:18.832
OH, WONDERFUL.

10:18.901 --> 10:21.235
OF COURSE, I'D EXPECT YOU
TO COVER MY TRAVEL EXPENSES.

10:21.303 --> 10:22.370
ABSOLUTELY.

10:22.437 --> 10:24.071
AND I'D NEED A NEW SUIT

10:24.139 --> 10:26.123
AND SOME
WALKING-AROUND MONEY.

10:26.191 --> 10:28.809
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO JUST PAY YOU?

10:28.876 --> 10:31.195
I WILL NOT TAKE A DIME!

11:27.903 --> 11:29.620
OW!

11:29.688 --> 11:32.590
CRAP.

11:41.749 --> 11:43.250
HEY, DAD,
DINNER'S READY.

11:46.287 --> 11:47.722
THAT'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

11:47.789 --> 11:49.223
I'VE GOT BIG NEWS.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.024
IF THIS IS
AN ECZEMA UPDATE,

11:51.092 --> 11:52.426
OK, I'M STILL REELING
FROM LAST WEEK.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.861
NO, NO.

11:53.928 --> 11:55.262
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

11:55.330 --> 11:58.032
WHAT? TO WHO?

11:58.099 --> 12:00.468
MISS AVA ST. CLAIR.

12:00.535 --> 12:03.237
AFTER HER TOUR, WE'RE
GETTING HITCHED IN TAHOE

12:03.305 --> 12:05.772
AND SETTLING IN HER
HOUSE IN ROCKLAND COUNTY.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.108
OK, DAD. YOU'RE NOT
GETTING MARRIED.

12:08.176 --> 12:09.176
LOOK,

12:09.211 --> 12:10.094
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
THREATENED BY

12:10.161 --> 12:11.295
ANOTHER WOMAN
IN MY LIFE.

12:11.362 --> 12:14.198
OK, SO, HERE'S WHAT
I NEED YOU TO DO.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.100
I NEED YOU TO TAKE A
COUPLE OF YOUR BLUE PILLS,

12:16.168 --> 12:19.303
GO DOWNSTAIRS, AND HAVE
YOURSELF A NICE LONG NAP,

12:19.371 --> 12:20.905
AND WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER, OK?

12:20.973 --> 12:22.256
I'M A GROWN MAN!

12:22.323 --> 12:24.725
STOP TREATING ME
LIKE A CHILD!

12:24.793 --> 12:27.245
WELL, STOP ACTING
LIKE A CHILD, OK?

12:27.312 --> 12:29.914
THERE'S NO WAY I'M LETTING YOU GET
MARRIED TO SOMEBODY YOU JUST MET.

12:29.982 --> 12:31.064
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE
STAYING RIGHT HERE.

12:34.987 --> 12:36.637
UNLESS...

12:36.705 --> 12:39.390
YOU REALLY,
REALLY LIKE HER.

12:42.543 --> 12:43.878
WE CAN DO IT!

12:43.945 --> 12:44.845
HUH?

12:44.913 --> 12:45.780
WE CAN MOVE TO THE CITY!

12:45.847 --> 12:49.049
WHAT ABOUT ARTHUR?
REMEMBER HIM?

12:49.117 --> 12:52.586
OLD GUY, SMELLS LIKE CHEESE,
EVEN WHEN HE HASN'T HAD ANY.

12:52.654 --> 12:54.771
HE'S GETTING MARRIED.

12:54.839 --> 12:55.590
TO WHO?

12:55.657 --> 12:57.308
TO THAT WOMAN WHO SINGS

12:57.375 --> 12:59.610
THAT STUPID
LOLLIPOP SONG.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.512
SHE HAS A BIG HOUSE, AND SHE'S
LETTING HIM MOVE IN WITH HER.

13:01.579 --> 13:03.647
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S LIKE FATE!

13:03.715 --> 13:04.815
CARRIE, WAIT.

13:04.883 --> 13:06.016
HE'S DONE THIS, LIKE,
A MILLION TIMES BEFORE,

13:06.084 --> 13:07.951
HE MOVES OUT AND THEN
HE COMES RIGHT BACK HERE.

13:08.019 --> 13:10.988
HE'S LIKE AN OLD,
WRINKLY BOOMERANG.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.940
NO, IT'S DIFFERENT
THIS TIME, I KNOW IT.

13:13.008 --> 13:14.992
OH, WHY? BECAUSE HE'S
MARRYING A COMPLETE STRANGER?

13:15.060 --> 13:16.227
D- DO YOU EVEN
KNOW HER NAME?

13:16.294 --> 13:17.361
OF COURSE
I KNOW HER NAME.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.863
IT'S AVA...
AVA SOMETHING.

13:19.931 --> 13:21.482
OH, THAT'S GOOD DAUGHTERING
RIGHT THERE,

13:21.550 --> 13:22.617
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HER LAST NAME.

13:22.684 --> 13:24.935
I KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING
TO BE. SPOONER.

13:25.003 --> 13:28.972
HA, COME ON, GIVE ME SOME
KNUCKLES ON THAT ONE, BUDDY!

13:29.040 --> 13:31.258
WOULD YOU LISTEN
TO YOURSELF?

13:31.326 --> 13:34.011
OK, LOOK, DOUG, I TALKED
TO HER ON THE PHONE,

13:34.079 --> 13:35.913
AND SHE SOUNDS LIKE
A VERY NICE WOMAN.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.665
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS ON
MERV GRIFFIN 53 TIMES?

13:38.733 --> 13:40.734
NOW, DO YOU THINK HE'D HAVE
SOMEBODY ON THE SHOW THAT MANY TIMES

13:40.802 --> 13:42.269
IF THEY WERE A BAD PERSON?

13:44.223 --> 13:46.023
NO.
NO, BABY.

13:46.091 --> 13:48.175
COME ON, I KNOW YOU LOVE
LIVING IN QUEENS,

13:48.243 --> 13:49.876
BUT YOU'RE GOING
TO LOVE THE CITY.

13:49.945 --> 13:51.611
IT'S LIKE
A NEW ADVENTURE FOR US.

13:51.679 --> 13:52.712
AND GUESS WHAT?

13:52.780 --> 13:54.514
WITH THE MONEY WE MAKE
ON SELLING THIS HOUSE,

13:54.582 --> 13:56.917
YOU CAN FINALLY
GET YOUR GO-KART.

13:56.935 --> 13:58.202
IT'S ALL
COMING TOGETHER!

14:01.122 --> 14:03.089
OH, I'M GETTING
THAT GO-KART,

14:03.157 --> 14:06.527
BUT WE'RE
NOT MOVING ANYWHERE.

14:13.134 --> 14:14.267
MAY I HELP YOU?

14:14.336 --> 14:17.070
YES, I'M, UH,
HERE TO SEE ARTHUR SPOONER.

14:17.138 --> 14:17.872
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT,
MARTA,

14:17.939 --> 14:20.324
HE'S MY SON-IN-LAW.

14:20.392 --> 14:23.510
OH, AND, MARTA, COULD YOU
HAVE NILS BRING THE CAR AROUND?

14:23.578 --> 14:26.213
I HAVE A YEN
FOR FROZEN YOGURT.

14:28.115 --> 14:30.083
SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU BY?

14:30.151 --> 14:33.220
HUH, IT'S JUST, EVERYTHING
HAPPENED SORT OF FAST,

14:33.287 --> 14:36.557
AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
SURE YOU WERE OK HERE.

14:36.624 --> 14:39.125
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU HAD IT
PRETTY GOOD BACK AT OUR HOUSE.

14:39.193 --> 14:41.712
I LIVED IN
A COLD, WET BASEMENT.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.414
YEAH, BUT WE GOT YOU
THAT SPACE HEATER.

14:43.482 --> 14:44.315
WHICH CAUGHT FIRE.
YEAH,

14:44.382 --> 14:45.866
BECAUSE YOU DRIED
YOUR SOCKS ON IT!

14:45.934 --> 14:48.052
BECAUSE THEY WERE
WET FROM THE BASEMENT!

14:48.120 --> 14:49.653
OK!

14:49.720 --> 14:51.021
WE CAN GO ROUND
AND ROUND ABOUT THIS.

14:51.089 --> 14:52.990
ALL RIGHT, THE POINT IS
PACK YOUR THINGS.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.291
YOU'RE COMING HOME
WITH ME. LET'S GO.

14:54.359 --> 14:58.762
DOUGLAS, I'M LIVING
THE LIFE OF RILEY HERE.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.764
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:00.832 --> 15:03.951
YOU WANT THE TRUTH?

15:05.286 --> 15:06.620
THE TRUTH IS...

15:07.622 --> 15:11.091
WELL, I MISS YOU.

15:11.158 --> 15:13.978
REALLY?

15:14.045 --> 15:16.313
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU FELT THAT WAY.

15:16.380 --> 15:17.848
IT'S BECAUSE I'M
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

15:17.916 --> 15:20.851
WHO KEEPS THEIR FEELINGS
BOTTLED UP.

15:20.919 --> 15:22.253
BUT I CAN'T
HIDE IT ANYMORE,

15:22.320 --> 15:26.456
I- I NEED
MY YAHTZEE BUDDY.

15:26.524 --> 15:30.661
BUT THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED,
YOU SHOVED THE DICE IN MY MOUTH.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.847
SOMETIMES
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH

15:33.915 --> 15:36.917
I GOTTA HURT YOU.

15:36.984 --> 15:39.185
WELL, I'M STAYING HERE.

15:39.253 --> 15:42.456
BUT I'LL TRY AND CARVE OUT
SOME TIME FOR YOU ON WEEKENDS.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.057
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME, ARTHUR.

15:44.125 --> 15:45.692
I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR STUFF
NOW. YOU'RE COMING HOME.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.027
I'M AFRAID THAT WON'T
BE HAPPENING.

15:47.095 --> 15:48.929
OH, I'M AFRAID IT WILL.
OH, I THINK NOT!

15:48.996 --> 15:49.680
ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN TO ME, ARTHUR.

15:49.748 --> 15:50.698
ALL RIGHT,
FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS,

15:50.766 --> 15:51.765
I'VE HAD TO WATCH YOU
CHEW YOUR FOOD

15:51.833 --> 15:52.900
WITH YOUR MOUTH OPEN

15:52.967 --> 15:54.868
AND CUT YOUR TOENAILS
ON MY BED.

15:54.936 --> 15:56.770
ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU CAN
FINALLY DO SOME GOOD FOR ME.

15:56.838 --> 15:58.088
SO, YOU'RE COMING
HOME WITH ME.

15:58.156 --> 16:00.191
YOU KNOW, WE CAN DO THIS THE EASY WAY...

16:00.258 --> 16:03.427
OR WE CAN DO THIS
THE HARD WAY.

16:05.363 --> 16:06.997
OK, WHAT'S THAT BUTTON?

16:07.065 --> 16:08.782
JUST LETTING
THE NYACK POLICE KNOW

16:08.849 --> 16:11.718
THAT A BIG-BONED INTRUDER
IS IN MY HOUSE.

16:17.875 --> 16:18.909
HEY, HEY, GUYS,

16:18.976 --> 16:19.827
WE'RE ABOUT
TO HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE,

16:19.894 --> 16:21.245
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SCOOT.

16:21.312 --> 16:23.647
REALLY? 'CAUSE WE HAD
NO IDEA.

16:23.715 --> 16:25.449
YEAH, THAT'S FUNNY.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.634
I MEAN, BECAUSE WE WERE ACTUALLY
THINKING ABOUT BUYING A HOUSE.

16:27.702 --> 16:29.003
REALLY?
YEAH.

16:29.070 --> 16:30.254
I MEAN, IT'D HAVE
TO BE A REALLY GREAT DEAL

16:30.322 --> 16:32.856
<i>BECAUSE WE DON'T
REALLY LOVE THE PLACE.</i>

16:32.924 --> 16:35.209
<i>I MEAN, WE LIKE IT LIKE IT,</i>

16:35.277 --> 16:37.043
<i>WE JUST
DON'T LOVE IT LOVE IT.</i>

16:37.111 --> 16:40.547
WELL, I WOULD WANT YOU TO
BUY ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T LOVE.

16:40.615 --> 16:42.482
SO,
LET'S GO.

16:42.550 --> 16:44.402
WAIT, C-CAN WE AT LEAST
LOOK AROUND?

16:44.469 --> 16:47.237
OK, FINE. BUT DON'T
DO ANYTHING WEIRD.

17:01.486 --> 17:04.253
ISN'T LIVING
IN THE CITY DELIGHTFUL?

17:04.321 --> 17:07.023
AND OUR FIRST COCKTAIL
PARTY, IT'S A HIT.

17:11.296 --> 17:14.948
OK, I'M GOING TO NEED
ABOUT 500 MORE OF THESE.

17:18.453 --> 17:20.921
SO, WHEN I FOUND OUT
IVANA WAS HAVING

17:20.989 --> 17:23.190
HER FUNDRAISER FOR
THE HOSPITAL ON FRIDAY,

17:23.258 --> 17:27.444
I MOVED MY AUCTION FOR
THE HOMELESS TO THURSDAY.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.396
WELL PLAYED, CARRIE.

17:32.467 --> 17:33.867
DOUG, RIGHT?

17:33.934 --> 17:35.536
YEAH. HI, I'M TUCKER CARLSON.

17:35.603 --> 17:36.936
I LIVE RIGHT ACROSS
THE HALL.

17:37.004 --> 17:38.705
IF YOU EVER WANT TO SWING
BY AND TALK POLITICS,

17:38.773 --> 17:40.541
DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

17:41.726 --> 17:43.193
NO!

17:45.463 --> 17:47.564
DOUG, COME ON, GET UP.
HMM?

17:47.632 --> 17:48.349
COME ON, PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO BE

17:48.500 --> 17:49.900
COMING THROUGH HERE
ANY MINUTE, HON.

17:49.968 --> 17:50.901
FOR WHAT?

17:50.969 --> 17:52.136
FOR THE OPEN HOUSE!

17:52.203 --> 17:53.637
CARRIE, LISTEN,
I REALLY THINK-

17:53.704 --> 17:56.924
OH, AND LOOK WHAT I GOT.

17:56.991 --> 17:59.543
KEYS? TO OUR APARTMENT IN THE CITY.

17:59.611 --> 18:01.261
I- I DON'T WANT TO DO IT!

18:01.328 --> 18:03.113
WHAT?
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE.

18:03.181 --> 18:05.533
DOUG, WHAT ARE
- YOU SAID YOU WERE OK WITH THIS,

18:05.600 --> 18:07.334
THAT MY DREAM
WAS YOUR DREAM.

18:07.402 --> 18:08.084
YEAH, I ONLY SAID THAT

18:08.152 --> 18:09.270
BECAUSE I KNEW
WE COULDN'T DO IT

18:09.337 --> 18:11.288
BECAUSE OF YOUR FATHER.

18:11.356 --> 18:12.923
OH, GOD.

18:14.826 --> 18:17.611
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO THIS!

18:17.678 --> 18:19.346
LOOK, CARRIE, IF I HAD A MAGIC
CARPET I'D GO BACK IN TIME

18:19.414 --> 18:22.315
AND I'D DO THINGS
DIFFERENTLY, BUT I DON'T!

18:22.383 --> 18:24.168
OK, MAGIC CARPETS
DON'T GO BACK IN TIME.

18:24.235 --> 18:25.585
YES, THEY DO.
NO, THEY DON'T.

18:25.653 --> 18:27.805
THEY TAKE YOU FROM ONE
PLACE TO ANOTHER, MAGICALLY,

18:27.873 --> 18:29.206
BUT THEY DON'T
GO BACK IN TIME.

18:29.273 --> 18:30.340
FINE, FINE, THEN I WOULD
GO IN A TIME MACHINE,

18:30.408 --> 18:32.376
THEY GO BACK IN TIME,
DON'T THEY? YEAH-

18:32.443 --> 18:33.544
YEAH, I GUESS THEY DO,

18:33.611 --> 18:36.079
AND IF I HAD ONE I WOULD GO
BACK BEFORE I EVEN MET YOU.

18:36.147 --> 18:37.731
HELLO!

18:37.799 --> 18:39.816
THIS IS THE MASTER.

18:39.884 --> 18:42.236
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S
LOTS OF CLOSET SPACE.

18:42.303 --> 18:43.503
IS THERE
COPPER PLUMBING?

18:43.571 --> 18:44.672
NO, IT'S RUSTY LEAD.

18:44.739 --> 18:48.024
NOW, BEAT IT.
BEAT IT!

18:51.128 --> 18:52.646
LOOK, DOUG,

18:52.713 --> 18:56.083
I
- I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE TO THE CITY,

18:56.150 --> 18:57.417
AND I KNOW WHY YOU
LIED TO ME,

18:57.485 --> 19:01.188
BUT THIS IS
IMPORTANT TO ME.

19:01.255 --> 19:03.490
AND IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT
YOU DREAMED OF YOUR WHOLE LIFE,

19:03.558 --> 19:05.859
AND I COULD GIVE IT
TO YOU, I WOULD.

19:05.927 --> 19:06.676
THAT'S PERFECT, CARRIE.

19:06.744 --> 19:08.194
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
MY DREAM IS?

19:08.262 --> 19:10.130
TO LIVE IN A HOUSE WITHOUT AN
OLD MAN LIVING IN THE BASEMENT.

19:10.197 --> 19:12.866
LET'S START THERE. WHAT DO
YOU SAY, DREAM WEAVER? HUH?

19:14.803 --> 19:18.121
OH, ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:18.189 --> 19:20.440
OH, OK.

19:20.508 --> 19:22.226
CARRIE, I UNDERSTAND,
OK, I GET IT, YOU'RE MAD.

19:22.293 --> 19:24.228
ALL RIGHT, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FAKE PACK.

19:24.295 --> 19:25.729
EXCUSE ME.

19:25.796 --> 19:27.130
WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT THE CITY, ANYWAY?

19:27.199 --> 19:28.899
YOU KNOW, IT'S CROWDED,
IT'S POLLUTED,

19:28.966 --> 19:30.000
<i>AND ACCORDING TO
THE PLANET OF THE APES,</i>

19:30.068 --> 19:32.002
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
THERE VERY LONG, ALL RIGHT?

19:37.541 --> 19:38.675
SO, WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:38.743 --> 19:40.344
YOU-YOU LEAVING ME?

19:40.412 --> 19:44.097
NO, DOUG, I AM MOVING TO
OUR APARTMENT IN THE CITY,

19:44.165 --> 19:47.334
AND I HOPE YOU JOIN ME.

19:47.401 --> 19:48.868
WELL, I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE, OK?

19:48.936 --> 19:52.506
IN FACT, I DON'T THINK I'M
EVER LEAVING THIS BEDROOM.

19:56.794 --> 19:58.628
YOU KNOW WHAT? GO.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE LEAVING.

19:58.696 --> 19:59.629
GOOD,
I'M GOING.

19:59.697 --> 20:00.580
GOOD.
GOOD!

20:00.648 --> 20:01.698
UH, CARRIE?

20:01.766 --> 20:03.934
WHAT?
UMM...

20:04.001 --> 20:05.603
COULD OUR INSPECTOR
COME BY TOMORROW?

20:05.670 --> 20:06.953
WE'RE NOT SELLING!

20:07.021 --> 20:08.122
YES, WE ARE.

20:08.189 --> 20:10.224
AT THIS POINT, I'D FRIGGIN'
GIVE THE HOUSE AWAY.

20:13.327 --> 20:14.561
FINE, GO TO YOUR
FANCY MANHATTAN.

20:14.629 --> 20:16.947
YOU KNOW, AND I'LL BE HERE,
KEEPING IT REAL.

20:17.015 --> 20:21.318
SHE'LL BE BACK
IN 5-4-3-2...
