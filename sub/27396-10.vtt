00:09.709 --> 00:13.291
By the authority vested in me
by the Planetary Union,

00:13.375 --> 00:16.583
I hereby present you,
Lieutenant Yaphit,

00:16.667 --> 00:19.667
with the Sapphire Star
for extraordinary heroism

00:19.750 --> 00:22.917
beyond the call of duty
during the Kaylon conflict.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.583
All in a day's work, Captain.

00:24.667 --> 00:26.625
(applause)

00:28.959 --> 00:31.500
(cheering)

00:36.542 --> 00:39.583
(jazz piano playing)

00:39.667 --> 00:41.834
Okay, okay.
Here we go.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.208
Eldorian vodka shots
for everybody.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.333
Oh, no. No, I cannot
do a shot of that stuff.

00:46.417 --> 00:48.500
-Come on, man. Just do it.
-Come on. Just do it.

00:48.583 --> 00:51.750
-I can't... My body will not
tolerate Eldorian vodka.
-Just down it. Go.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.458
Okay, you know, I'll take
a small sip. How about that?

00:53.542 --> 00:54.709
-Small sip.
-I mean, look,
on the count of three,

00:54.792 --> 00:55.875
we'll all do it.

00:55.959 --> 00:58.333
One, two, three.

00:59.709 --> 01:02.041
(coughing)
Wow. (coughs)

01:02.125 --> 01:03.291
That is good stuff.
You weren't lying.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.917
You just dumped it on the floor.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.667
<i>COMM VOICE:</i>
<i>Bridge to Captain Mercer.</i>

01:06.750 --> 01:10.083
Got to take that.
Mercer here. Go ahead.

01:10.166 --> 01:13.125
<i>COMM VOICE:</i>
<i>Sir, Admiral Perry is calling</i>

01:13.208 --> 01:15.250

01:15.333 --> 01:17.291
We're on our way.

01:17.375 --> 01:18.083
Thanks.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.083
<i>I heard there was a ceremony.</i>

01:27.166 --> 01:28.458
<i>Sorry to interrupt.</i>

01:28.542 --> 01:31.500
No, your timing was great
for me, actually.

01:31.583 --> 01:33.333
<i>Captain, I have historic news.</i>

01:33.417 --> 01:36.166
<i>The Krill are ready</i>
<i>to negotiate a peace treaty.</i>

01:36.250 --> 01:37.875
Are you serious?

01:37.959 --> 01:39.542
Is this because
of the Kaylon threat?

01:39.625 --> 01:41.291
<i>That's the primary reason.</i>

01:41.375 --> 01:44.291
<i>But we suspect there may also</i>
<i>be progressive elements</i>

01:44.375 --> 01:45.875
<i>within the Krill</i>
<i>power structure</i>

01:45.959 --> 01:47.792
<i>who are flexing</i>
<i>a bit of muscle.</i>

01:47.875 --> 01:49.333
<i>Regardless of the cause,</i>

01:49.417 --> 01:52.166
<i>we've been trying to open</i>
<i>a dialogue with them for years.</i>

01:52.250 --> 01:53.750
<i>We were hoping the cease-fire</i>

01:53.834 --> 01:55.375
<i>after the battle</i>
<i>with the Kaylon</i>

01:55.458 --> 01:57.792
<i>would lead to talks,</i>
<i>and it looks like it has.</i>

01:57.875 --> 02:00.458
Admiral, this is
incredible news,

02:00.542 --> 02:02.500
but I'm just curious,
why call us?

02:02.583 --> 02:04.333
<i>Because you're going</i>
<i>to shepherd the signing</i>

02:04.417 --> 02:07.333
<i>-of the Lak'vai Pact.</i>
-The what?

02:07.417 --> 02:10.041
<i>In the Krill political process,</i>
<i>it's a sort of prelude</i>

02:10.125 --> 02:11.709
<i>to a peace treaty.</i>

02:11.792 --> 02:14.166
<i>It indicates that both parties</i>
<i>will approach the table</i>

02:14.250 --> 02:15.166
<i>in good faith.</i>

02:15.250 --> 02:17.333
Sir, with all due respect,

02:17.417 --> 02:19.375
you must have hundreds
of diplomats

02:19.458 --> 02:20.750
who are more
qualified for this.

02:20.834 --> 02:23.625
<i>To be honest, there's no one</i>
<i>who's qualified.</i>

02:23.709 --> 02:25.917
<i>The only direct,</i>
<i>long-term dealing we've had</i>

02:26.000 --> 02:27.291
<i>with the Krill</i>
<i>is the undercover mission</i>

02:27.375 --> 02:30.000
<i>conducted by you</i>
<i>and Lieutenant Malloy.</i>

02:30.083 --> 02:31.375
<i>And, of course, your...</i>

02:31.458 --> 02:33.500
<i>relationship</i>
<i>with the Krill woman</i>

02:33.583 --> 02:36.500
<i>-who infiltrated your ship.</i>
-Yeah.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.250
Admiral, what do you
want us to do?

02:38.333 --> 02:41.583

-The<i> Davoro'kos. </i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

02:45.000 --> 02:47.208
<i>It means "bringer of blood."</i>

02:47.291 --> 02:49.291
-Oh, that's cool.
<i>-The ship will be carrying</i>

02:49.375 --> 02:51.792

<i>You'll host them</i>
<i>in the briefing room.</i>

02:53.917 --> 02:56.417
<i>If you can secure the signing</i>
<i>of the Lak'vai,</i>

02:56.500 --> 02:58.375
<i>it throws the door wide open</i>

02:58.458 --> 03:01.583
<i>for the admirals to begin</i>
<i>official treaty negotiations.</i>

03:01.667 --> 03:04.291

you'd had that shot.

03:26.375 --> 03:29.333

03:29.417 --> 03:32.625
Leave them down.
Let's show a little trust.

03:32.709 --> 03:36.333
Sir, there is another
vessel in range.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.083
It is a Krill shuttle.

03:38.166 --> 03:40.583
The Krill vessel
is firing on it.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.083
They're firing
on their own shuttle?

03:46.125 --> 03:47.709
The Krill shuttle
is hailing us.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.709

It's okay.
You're safe.

04:43.375 --> 04:44.333
No...

04:44.417 --> 04:45.834
It's okay.

04:45.917 --> 04:47.500
It's... it's just a medscanner.

Is there any way
you could stall the Krill?

07:22.333 --> 07:24.500
I think I can cite
a few boarding regulations

07:24.583 --> 07:25.834
that might take some time.

07:25.917 --> 07:27.250
Thanks.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.291
Orrin and I were best friends.

07:31.375 --> 07:34.250
From grade school all the way
through Union Point.

07:34.333 --> 07:35.917
We were both
in our early twenties,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.250
and we were stationed
on Outpost 73.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.542
Orrin was living there
with his wife

07:40.625 --> 07:42.709
and their newborn
daughter, Leyna,

07:42.792 --> 07:45.875
when the Krill made a surprise
attack on the outpost.

07:45.959 --> 07:48.625
Orrin's wife was killed and he
and his daughter disappeared.

07:48.709 --> 07:49.875
Oh, my God.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.667
No one ever heard
from them again.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.667
It was assumed they were
captured or killed.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.542
-And now here they are.
-Yeah.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.583
(inhales sharply)

08:03.667 --> 08:05.709
Easy.
Don't try to sit up yet.

08:05.792 --> 08:08.709
Your head's gonna be okay.
But don't push it.

08:08.792 --> 08:09.834
Where's my daughter?

08:09.917 --> 08:11.917
She's resting in guest quarters.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.166
I tried to get her into sickbay,
but she went into a panic.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.709
Well, after what they did
to her, I'm not surprised.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.542
I asked her what was wrong,
but she won't speak.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.333
She hasn't said a word
in 12 years.

08:23.417 --> 08:24.792
Why not?

08:26.792 --> 08:29.000
You try spending your entire
life in a Krill prison camp,

08:29.083 --> 08:30.583
you see how chatty
you're feeling.

08:30.667 --> 08:31.959
What happened?

08:33.875 --> 08:36.583
Let's just say the Krill doctors
weren't exactly gentle

08:36.667 --> 08:38.291
with their examinations.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.208
I understand.

08:40.291 --> 08:42.583
But I've got to be able
to examine her myself

08:42.667 --> 08:43.875
to make sure she's okay.

08:43.959 --> 08:45.709
She's healthy.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.583
At least, physically.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.583
Just give her a few days
to trust her surroundings.

Orrin.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.458
It's been 20 years.
I don't even know what to say.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.166
Last time I saw you,
you had a Mohawk. (chuckles)

09:04.250 --> 09:05.625
Yeah, no, believe me,
I remember,

09:05.709 --> 09:07.667
not my proudest moment.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.208
Orrin, what happened to you?

09:10.667 --> 09:12.166
ED:
I'm sorry to cut this short,

09:12.250 --> 09:13.458
but there's a more
immediate matter

09:13.542 --> 09:14.959
that needs to be resolved.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.750
Lieutenant Channing,
I'm Captain Ed Mercer.

09:16.834 --> 09:18.750
I feel like a jerk

09:18.834 --> 09:20.667
saying this to you after
what you've been through,

09:20.750 --> 09:23.792
but you should know the Krill
ship that was chasing you

09:23.875 --> 09:26.417
is demanding that I return you
to their custody.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.125
They're saying you violated
the cease-fire with the Union

09:29.208 --> 09:31.041
on three occasions
in the past month.

09:31.125 --> 09:33.125
You got to be kidding me.

09:33.208 --> 09:36.667
Captain, Leyna and I were in
that Krill prison for 20 years.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.041
And we escaped six weeks ago
by stealing a Krill shuttle.

09:39.125 --> 09:41.208
We ran out of plasma
for the quantum drive

09:41.291 --> 09:42.834
before we could reach
Union space. It...

09:42.917 --> 09:45.041
it took us a month
just to get this far.

09:45.125 --> 09:46.458
Why didn't you use
the comm system,

09:46.542 --> 09:47.750
call the Union for help?

09:47.834 --> 09:50.291
Couldn't risk divulging
our location to the Krill.

09:50.375 --> 09:51.834
If they'd intercepted
the message

09:51.917 --> 09:54.041
before it got to the Union,
they would've snatched us up

09:54.125 --> 09:55.834
and thrown us right back
in that prison cell.

09:55.917 --> 09:58.834
No way in hell
we were going back there.

09:58.917 --> 10:01.083
So you know nothing
about those Krill ships.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.834
Not a thing, sir.

10:02.917 --> 10:05.041
I didn't even know
there was a cease-fire.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.583
May I have the fleet
registry number

10:12.667 --> 10:13.709
for your vessel, please?

10:13.792 --> 10:15.709
I've already told you twice.

10:15.792 --> 10:17.709
Oh, yes, of course.
It's right here.

10:17.792 --> 10:18.792
Mother's maiden name?

10:18.875 --> 10:21.458
These boarding regulations
are outrageous.

10:21.542 --> 10:24.083
I'm just doing my job, sir.
Mother's maiden name?

10:24.166 --> 10:25.458
Kalavus.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.417
And are you carrying
any fruits or vegetables,

10:27.500 --> 10:29.750
or livestock of any kind?
Snails?

10:29.834 --> 10:31.875
-Of course not.
-All right.

10:31.959 --> 10:33.208
Then I'll just need
a urine sample,

10:33.291 --> 10:35.458
-and you're good to go.
-What?

10:35.542 --> 10:37.542
A urine sample.
From each of you.

10:37.625 --> 10:40.417
Just go ahead and fill these up,
or as much as you got in you.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.875
And where are we supposed
to do that?

10:42.959 --> 10:44.417
You can go behind
the crates over there.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.291
I won't look.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.667

-Yeah?

11:03.750 --> 11:05.208
<i>Keyali here.</i>
<i>Captain, I can't</i>

11:05.291 --> 11:06.792
<i>stall the Krill any longer.</i>

11:06.875 --> 11:09.333
<i>I've come up with every</i>
<i>boarding check I can think of,</i>

11:09.417 --> 11:10.750

11:10.834 --> 11:12.375
Just buy me five
more minutes, okay?

11:12.458 --> 11:13.875
Then take them straight
to the briefing room.

11:13.959 --> 11:15.125
<i>Captain, I don't know</i>
<i>what else I can do...</i>

11:15.208 --> 11:17.041

11:17.125 --> 11:19.625

11:24.000 --> 11:25.166
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.500
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:29.583 --> 11:30.709
Am I interrupting?

11:30.792 --> 11:32.375
I'm just trying
to find anything

11:32.458 --> 11:33.959
in the Union
intelligence briefings

11:34.041 --> 11:35.834
that confirms the destruction
of those Krill ships,

11:35.917 --> 11:37.917
just in case they're lying.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.542
You're not thinking you might
turn Orrin over to them?

11:41.625 --> 11:44.250
No, we have no extradition
treaty with the Krill.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.333
Besides, if I did that,
they'd kill him.

11:46.417 --> 11:48.709
Well, for what it's worth,
I know Orrin.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.333
He couldn't have done what
they're saying. He's a good guy.

11:52.959 --> 11:54.750
Look, I know he's your friend.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.792
And I understand that he's just
been through a nightmare,

11:56.875 --> 11:58.375
but honestly, Gordon,

11:58.458 --> 12:00.834
he could not have shown up
at a worse time.

12:00.917 --> 12:02.875
I mean, I got to tell you, this
puts me in a hell of a bind.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.333
I know.

12:04.417 --> 12:07.834
You know, maybe we could--
I don't know--

12:07.917 --> 12:10.875
offer the Krill
something else instead.

12:10.959 --> 12:11.917
Like what?

12:13.625 --> 12:15.750
Free back rubs or something?

12:17.583 --> 12:18.959
Yeah, listen,
I got to get back to this.

12:19.041 --> 12:20.291
-Yeah, no, no, do your thing,
do your thing.
-'Cause I have to...

12:20.375 --> 12:22.291
-I was just pitching ideas.
-It's a good pitch.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.333
-I'll take it
under consideration.
-Okay.

12:23.417 --> 12:24.917
-I'll talk to you later.
-Okay.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.583
(door whooshes shut)

12:31.709 --> 12:34.208
Captain Mercer,
when may we expect the return

12:34.291 --> 12:36.375
of the criminal you are holding?

12:36.458 --> 12:39.667
Well, I was actually hoping
we could table that for now.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.834
We have told you
what he has done.

12:41.917 --> 12:44.792
He has a young daughter with
him. She needs time to heal.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.333
Whatever your damn prison
did to her was...

12:46.417 --> 12:49.750
We do not want the girl,
only the butcher.

12:49.834 --> 12:52.041
Those four Krill vessels held

12:52.125 --> 12:54.917
a combined crew complement
of 1,200.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.959
All dead by his hand.

12:57.041 --> 12:59.792
Ambassador, I'm very sorry
for your loss,

12:59.875 --> 13:02.667
but you still haven't told us
how one man in a stolen shuttle

13:02.750 --> 13:05.000
could have destroyed
four Krill ships.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.166
We do not know how he did it.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.834
That is what
an interrogation is for.

13:09.917 --> 13:12.208
Look, Ambassador,
let's not kid ourselves.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.291
We all know an interrogation
means death.

13:14.375 --> 13:18.000
The death of one against
the death of 1,200.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.959
You are godless heretics
by nature,

13:21.041 --> 13:23.583
but even you cannot ignore
such killing.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.917
I seem to recall being on board
a Krill vessel

13:27.000 --> 13:29.667
that was prepared to wipe out
an entire Union colony,

13:29.750 --> 13:31.959
but let's not go there
right now. Look,

13:32.041 --> 13:34.834
our two peoples
have been in conflict

13:34.917 --> 13:36.917
for longer than you
and I have been alive.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.667
Hundreds of thousands of people
have died as a result.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.625
We have a chance to stop
the hate and the violence

13:42.709 --> 13:46.375
right here, right now,
by agreeing to peace.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.083
So let's focus on making
that happen.

13:48.166 --> 13:51.000
Unless you return the criminal
to our custody,

13:51.083 --> 13:53.500
there will be no peace.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.458
Our ship will return
in 12 hours.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.500
You have that long to decide

13:57.583 --> 14:01.166
if this will be a Lak'vai
or a battleground.

14:32.834 --> 14:36.125
She's really got a knack
for Bolodon discs.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.083
She's fascinated.

14:38.166 --> 14:40.125
This whole ship's
a brand-new world to her.

14:40.208 --> 14:43.333
Every experience is either
enthralling or terrifying.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.834
GORDON:
The last time I saw her,
she was just a baby.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.959
How bad was it in there, really?

14:51.041 --> 14:54.125
It was bad.

14:54.208 --> 14:56.125
It was harder on Leyna.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.709
She didn't have the advantage
of Union training.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.041
She's tough, though.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.709
She's tougher than she looks.

15:03.750 --> 15:07.875
Listen, Orrin,
I never got to say thank you.

15:07.959 --> 15:10.333
You saved my life that day.

15:10.417 --> 15:11.875
Just doing my job.

15:11.959 --> 15:14.083
Mm, maybe, but...

15:14.166 --> 15:16.291
we both know if you
hadn't stopped to pull me

15:16.375 --> 15:18.709
and the others out
of that wreckage,

15:18.792 --> 15:21.792
we would've been captured
or killed.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.166
It could've been me in that
Krill prison instead of you.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.083
I owe you.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.208
You owe me nothing.

15:28.291 --> 15:29.917
We were a team.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.834
I'm sorry about Sophie.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.208
I wish I could've
been there for you.

15:36.291 --> 15:38.625
I was in a Krill prison camp.

15:38.709 --> 15:40.375
You were in a Union hospital
trying to decide

15:40.458 --> 15:41.959
whether to keep your Mohawk,

15:42.041 --> 15:43.959
but I appreciate the thought.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.959
Losing her was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

15:54.041 --> 15:56.583
You know what scared me
the most?

15:56.667 --> 15:59.000
It was the knowledge
that someday,

15:59.083 --> 16:02.208
years down the line,
there would come a time

16:02.291 --> 16:05.959
when her absence
would feel like the norm,

16:06.041 --> 16:08.875
when I would resign myself
to her loss,

16:08.959 --> 16:11.792
and my life--

16:11.875 --> 16:13.625
the life that
I accepted as real--

16:13.709 --> 16:16.834
would be the one
without her in it.

16:19.959 --> 16:21.875
And now that is my reality.

16:25.125 --> 16:28.041
But I'm... I'm okay.

16:28.125 --> 16:30.417
And all I want
from this point on

16:30.500 --> 16:33.583
is for Leyna to have
the life she deserves.

16:35.291 --> 16:39.000
If there's anything I can do,
you name it.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.625
You can tell your captain
that this peace

16:41.709 --> 16:44.667
with the Krill--
it's a big mistake.

16:44.750 --> 16:47.125
Do you really believe that?

16:47.208 --> 16:50.083
You make a deal with tyranny,
it only gets worse.

16:50.166 --> 16:52.291
A lot of people have died
during this conflict.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.083
If we can secure a treaty,

16:54.166 --> 16:57.041
then they didn't die
for nothing.

16:57.125 --> 16:59.625
It'll bring meaning
to Sophie's death.

17:01.959 --> 17:04.083
Don't you ever say that again.

17:04.166 --> 17:05.417
Ever.

17:07.959 --> 17:11.083
Peace with the Krill is a slap
in the face of Sophie's memory.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.083
It's the Union saying,

17:13.166 --> 17:15.208
"We forgive you
for all the atrocities.

17:15.291 --> 17:17.250
We didn't care
about those people anyway."

17:17.333 --> 17:18.917
Orrin, I'm sorry, I-I didn't
mean to imply that...

17:19.000 --> 17:22.083
I d-I'm...
I'm tired.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.709
I need to sleep.

17:25.417 --> 17:27.333
Look, Orrin,

17:27.417 --> 17:30.291
I know you're a patriot
at heart.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.333
And when you boil it down,
that's what this is about.

17:33.667 --> 17:36.792
Patriotism is only for people
with large families.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.417
KELLY:
Do you know what this is, Leyna?

17:53.500 --> 17:56.750
It's a musical instrument from
Talla's home planet Xelayah.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.500
It's called a pelpifa.

17:58.583 --> 18:02.000
It combines musical tones with
holographic patterns. Watch.

19:07.792 --> 19:10.166
I have absolutely nothing
to base this on,

19:10.250 --> 19:12.542
but I don't trust him.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.125
And why not?

19:14.208 --> 19:15.500
Like I said, no reason.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.208
He's a Union officer.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.542
He's obviously a close friend
of Lieutenant Malloy's.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.250
He's been through
a hellish experience

19:21.333 --> 19:22.709
and he deserves our sympathy.

19:22.792 --> 19:25.750
But something about him
rubs me the wrong way.

19:25.834 --> 19:29.208
Do you think there's
any possibility at all

19:29.291 --> 19:31.458
that he could've somehow
destroyed those Krill ships?

19:31.542 --> 19:33.625
I did a standard security sweep
of him and his shuttle

19:33.709 --> 19:35.375
and I did not find
a single weapon.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.458
-What about torpedoes?
-Empty.

19:37.542 --> 19:41.208
So the lack of evidence would
suggest the Krill are lying.

19:41.291 --> 19:42.834
It looks that way.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.583
I need to know for sure,
and soon.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.250
Even if he had
destroyed those ships,

19:49.333 --> 19:50.792
could you blame him?

19:50.875 --> 19:52.875
If I'd been through what he has,

19:52.959 --> 19:55.166
I'd probably want
every last one of them dead.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.375
And this is why peace treaties
don't happen every day.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.041
Do me a favor--
keep an eye on him.

20:02.125 --> 20:04.166
Yes, sir, will do.

20:06.041 --> 20:08.000

23:23.542 --> 23:25.542
Sir, the Krill have made it
clear they won't even begin

23:25.625 --> 23:27.750
a dialogue with us
unless we give them Orrin.

23:27.834 --> 23:29.583

And without this alliance,
we're no match for the Kaylon.

23:35.041 --> 23:36.625
So the admiralty is considering

23:36.709 --> 23:38.625
a provisional extradition
agreement.

23:38.709 --> 23:39.667
What?

23:39.750 --> 23:41.583
Only if he's guilty,

23:41.667 --> 23:43.458
and it's just
a discussion, for now.

23:43.542 --> 23:45.041
Admiral, if we hand him over
to the Krill,

23:45.125 --> 23:46.709
they will torture him
and kill him.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.417
And if we don't,
there will be no treaty,

23:48.500 --> 23:49.875
and billions more could die.

23:49.959 --> 23:51.500
What about his service record?

23:51.583 --> 23:54.500
I mean, the guy just spent
20 years in a Krill prison.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.792
How the hell can we even think
about sending him back?

<i>No one is disputing</i>
<i>his heroism,</i>

23:59.500 --> 24:01.458
<i>but we need more information.</i>

24:01.542 --> 24:04.291
<i>Captain, it's imperative</i>
<i>that you find out</i>

24:04.375 --> 24:06.875
<i>if this man is guilty of what</i>
<i>they're charging him with.</i>

24:06.959 --> 24:09.291
We'll do our best.

24:10.875 --> 24:12.417
Is this who we are now?

24:14.709 --> 24:16.709
We need a lead, and fast.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.083
<i>You maniacs!</i>

24:23.166 --> 24:25.125
<i>You blew it up!</i>

24:25.208 --> 24:28.250
<i>Oh, damn you!</i>

24:28.333 --> 24:29.625
Okay, watch this,
watch this.

24:29.709 --> 24:31.333
<i>Damn you all to hell!</i>

24:31.417 --> 24:32.709
Get ready.

24:32.792 --> 24:35.667
Here it comes.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.500
Bam!

24:37.583 --> 24:39.667
Huh?

24:39.750 --> 24:41.917
He was on Earth the whole time.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.125
(chuckling): Isn't that...
isn't that nuts?

24:44.208 --> 24:46.166
Did you see that coming?

24:47.667 --> 24:49.250
Hey, you know,
you don't have to worry--

24:49.333 --> 24:52.250
the real Earth isn't like that.

24:52.333 --> 24:54.917
I know you've never seen it,
but it's really cool.

24:57.125 --> 24:59.291
Maybe someday
your dad'll take you there.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.750
(door chimes)

25:01.834 --> 25:03.500
Come in.

25:04.792 --> 25:05.959
Hey.

25:06.041 --> 25:08.542
-Ed, hey.
-What's going on?

25:08.625 --> 25:11.583
Oh, I was just giving Leyna
a crash course in the classics.

25:11.667 --> 25:13.208
Great.

25:13.291 --> 25:15.291
Listen, can I talk to you
for a second?

25:15.375 --> 25:17.500
-Sure. What's up?
-Privately?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.709
What is it?

25:25.792 --> 25:28.709
Look, if there's anything
I should know about Orrin,

25:28.792 --> 25:30.709
now is the time to tell me.

25:30.792 --> 25:32.208
Like what?

25:32.291 --> 25:33.917
Has he said anything?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.542
Anything at all to indicate

25:35.625 --> 25:37.625
that he might have violated
the cease-fire?

25:38.750 --> 25:40.583
Are you serious right now?

25:40.667 --> 25:43.625
Ed, the-the guy is one
of the most dedicated officers

25:43.709 --> 25:46.750
I've ever known.
Wha... What's going on?

25:46.834 --> 25:49.000
The admirals are considering

25:49.083 --> 25:50.750
a provisional
extradition agreement

25:50.834 --> 25:52.125
if he's guilty.

25:52.208 --> 25:54.375
Wait, you wouldn't
follow through with it.

25:54.458 --> 25:57.333
I just need as much information
as I can get right now.

25:57.417 --> 25:59.583
Ed, all he's done is survive.

25:59.667 --> 26:01.625
He raised that girl by himself.

26:01.709 --> 26:04.125
She doesn't have anyone else
in this world but him.

26:04.208 --> 26:05.750
Gordon, I'm on your side,
all right?

26:05.834 --> 26:07.333
But the sooner I know
what's going on,

26:07.417 --> 26:09.750
the sooner I can figure out
a way to help this guy

26:09.834 --> 26:11.208
without selling out the Union.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.375
Now, just tell me
if he said anything.

26:15.208 --> 26:17.750
He just said he thinks
the peace is a mistake.

26:17.834 --> 26:19.625
He said that?

26:19.709 --> 26:21.166
Yeah. What-what... what of it?

26:21.250 --> 26:22.625
You know what?

26:22.709 --> 26:24.667
I think it's a mistake, too.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.834
-Oh, come on.
You don't mean that.
-Yeah, I do.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.875
They're butchering,
fundamentalist fanatics.

26:28.959 --> 26:31.000
-We shouldn't
even be talking to them.
-Gordon,

26:31.083 --> 26:33.000
you're smarter than that.
Don't let him get in your head.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.792
-Oh, my God.
-What?

26:36.875 --> 26:37.959
You're jealous.

26:38.041 --> 26:39.959
I'm not jealous.
What am I jealous of?

26:40.041 --> 26:42.291
Our friendship. Orrin and I
have known each other longer

26:42.375 --> 26:45.208
than you and I have. We're
close, and you don't like that.

26:45.291 --> 26:47.792
-That's insane. What are we,
in sixth grade here?
-I guess so.

26:47.875 --> 26:49.709
Look, Gordon, I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

26:49.792 --> 26:51.208
The right thing
is to protect him.

26:51.291 --> 26:53.667
He's a Union officer.
Do your job.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.291
I'll let you know
when I figure out what that is.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.625
(door whooshes open)

27:20.500 --> 27:22.875
Hey, there.
How was the movie?

27:22.959 --> 27:25.875
Oh, I... I think
she saw the twist ending coming.

27:25.959 --> 27:26.875
(chuckles)

27:26.959 --> 27:29.291
She's a smart one.

27:29.375 --> 27:30.959
Orrin.

27:33.166 --> 27:34.500
You...

27:34.583 --> 27:37.458
you didn't violate
the cease-fire, did you?

27:38.542 --> 27:39.834
Wh-What?

27:39.917 --> 27:41.834
Ed told me.

27:41.917 --> 27:44.333
The admirals are talking
extradition.

27:45.917 --> 27:47.417
(scoffs)

27:49.834 --> 27:51.792
Political snakes.

27:53.041 --> 27:56.083
-We need to act now.
-Huh?

27:56.166 --> 27:58.542
There's a way we can stop
this peace from happening.

27:58.625 --> 28:00.083
All I need is a shuttle.
Can you get me one?

28:00.166 --> 28:01.875
I...

28:01.959 --> 28:03.709
A shuttle? Orrin,
what are you talking about?

28:03.792 --> 28:05.792
You don't believe
in this peace any more

28:05.875 --> 28:07.875
than I do.
Get me a shuttle. I can stop it.

28:07.959 --> 28:09.875
How?

28:09.959 --> 28:11.625
I'll tell you
once we're off the<i> Orville. </i>

28:12.792 --> 28:14.333
Orrin, I-I can't do that.

28:14.417 --> 28:15.792
Why not?

28:15.875 --> 28:18.166
Because I just... can't.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.500
Well, then, you're gonna have
to report me to your captain.

28:25.917 --> 28:27.917
I saved your life,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.917
and I paid for it
with 20 years of my own.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.583
Now I'm asking a favor of you.

28:34.959 --> 28:37.166
Don't make me regret
the sacrifice I made.

28:57.166 --> 29:00.166
Hey, Yaphit, can you grab me
a conduit buffer cap?

29:00.250 --> 29:02.667
Think he went to the bathroom.

29:04.834 --> 29:06.959
It's all right,
I'll get it.

29:23.208 --> 29:25.875
Two of these have gone missing
from the supply area.

29:25.959 --> 29:27.166
What is it?

29:27.250 --> 29:28.667
It's a quantum storage cell.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.750
It uses a small anti-grav field

29:30.834 --> 29:33.208
to transport quantum plasma
from one place to another.

29:33.291 --> 29:36.000
Orrin was back there. That's
where I saw him snooping around.

29:36.083 --> 29:39.041
Quantum plasma
can be weaponized.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.625
Is any of it missing?

29:40.709 --> 29:42.166
Uh, it's not exactly
an easy thing

29:42.250 --> 29:43.959
to just walk
into engineering and take,

29:44.041 --> 29:46.125
but I checked anyway.
It's all there.

29:46.208 --> 29:47.959
Any traces of it
elsewhere on the ship?

29:48.041 --> 29:49.583
I did a scan, just in case.
Nope.

29:49.667 --> 29:51.041
BORTUS:
Lieutenant,

29:51.125 --> 29:54.000
you did do a full sweep
when this man came on board?

29:54.083 --> 29:56.250
For the last time, yes.
I scanned him completely.

29:56.333 --> 29:58.875
I've even scanned the entire
ship for any anomalous weapons--

29:58.959 --> 30:01.208
plasma, chemical,
biological, everything.

30:01.291 --> 30:03.417
-What about his daughter?
-Checked her, too.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.834
No weapons of any kind.

30:04.917 --> 30:06.834
Look, if it'll make everyone
feel better,

30:06.917 --> 30:08.834
I'll perform
a second shipwide sweep,

30:08.917 --> 30:11.041
but I can already tell you
I'm not gonna find anything.

30:11.125 --> 30:12.709
So basically,
all this guy has done is

30:12.792 --> 30:14.500
steal a bunch of pens
from the office.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.333
What are we missing?

30:27.750 --> 30:29.750
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.750
Lieutenant Malloy.
What can I do for you?

30:36.834 --> 30:40.834
I was wondering if you wanted
to get a drink or something.

30:40.917 --> 30:43.250
You want to get a drink with me?

30:43.333 --> 30:45.542
Yeah. Sure. Why not?
(chuckles)

30:45.625 --> 30:48.500
Thought we might get to know
each other a little better.

30:48.583 --> 30:50.959
Are you asking me out?

30:51.041 --> 30:52.959
No. No, no, I'm not.

30:53.041 --> 30:56.125
I just... felt like a drink.

30:57.208 --> 30:58.834
I suppose I could use a break.

30:58.917 --> 31:00.291
Mess hall?

31:01.917 --> 31:03.875
Or we could just have a drink
right here.

31:03.959 --> 31:05.875
There's the bartender.

31:11.125 --> 31:13.250
One Scotch, neat. You?

31:13.333 --> 31:16.542
-Xelayan rum.
-And a Xelayan rum.

31:24.166 --> 31:25.834
Thanks.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.291
Cheers.

31:38.208 --> 31:39.959
Talla, I have
to tell you something.

31:40.041 --> 31:41.750
What?

31:41.834 --> 31:43.875
Orrin...

31:43.959 --> 31:46.333
asked me to steal a shuttle.

31:46.417 --> 31:47.959
When?

31:48.041 --> 31:49.792
Earlier today.

31:49.875 --> 31:52.333
He said all he needed was
a shuttle, and he could

31:52.417 --> 31:54.917
-stop the peace.
-How does he plan to do that?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.917
He said he wouldn't tell me
until we're off the<i> Orville. </i>

31:58.000 --> 31:59.417
Have you told the captain?

31:59.500 --> 32:01.625
No. Look,

32:01.709 --> 32:04.375
Talla, I know
I have to tell him.

32:04.458 --> 32:07.542
But if I do, I've betrayed a man
who saved my life,

32:07.625 --> 32:11.125
a friend who goes back 30 years.

32:11.208 --> 32:13.333
And if I don't,

32:13.417 --> 32:15.959
I've betrayed this ship

32:16.041 --> 32:18.417
and Ed.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.500
By telling me,

32:20.583 --> 32:23.333
you know
you've made your choice.

32:25.250 --> 32:28.375
I guess I just wanted
to hear myself say it out loud.

32:31.041 --> 32:32.542
Don't talk to the captain.

32:32.625 --> 32:34.375
I'll tell him.

32:51.917 --> 32:53.959
(door whooshes open)

32:55.291 --> 32:56.959
Let's go.

33:14.917 --> 33:16.875
♪ ♪

33:37.750 --> 33:40.208
I thought you said you were
gonna talk to the captain.

33:40.291 --> 33:42.250
-Talla, please.
-I don't know what the hell

33:42.333 --> 33:44.709
you think you're doing,
but you're gonna turn around

33:44.792 --> 33:46.083
and walk back out that door.

33:46.166 --> 33:49.250
Please. Don't get
in the middle of this.

33:49.333 --> 33:52.083
We both know I can put
your lights out with one hand.

33:52.166 --> 33:54.417
Don't make me do it.

33:56.166 --> 33:58.125
I'm sorry.

34:06.291 --> 34:08.667
Skip the prep.
We got to get out of here fast.

34:08.750 --> 34:10.041
Copy.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.750
Sort of like being back
in flight school, eh?

34:34.834 --> 34:37.166
Captain,
Shuttle 1 has just launched.

34:37.250 --> 34:39.041
Tracking device is functioning.

34:39.125 --> 34:40.750
Good. Keep monitoring.

34:40.834 --> 34:42.417
This is a big friggin' gamble.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.291
I know.

34:44.375 --> 34:45.542
Mercer to Keyali.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.458
<i>-How are you doing?</i>
-(groans softly)

34:47.542 --> 34:49.250
He could've lightened up
on the stun,

34:49.333 --> 34:51.000
but he played the part well.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.125
<i>-I'm gonna go check on Leyna.</i>
-ISAAC: Captain,

34:53.208 --> 34:56.125

-Put 'em on.

34:56.208 --> 34:58.333
<i>Captain Mercer,</i>

34:58.417 --> 35:01.667
<i>we will arrive at the</i>

35:01.750 --> 35:04.125
<i>I do hope you have made</i>

35:04.208 --> 35:05.542
<i>regarding the criminal.</i>

35:05.625 --> 35:07.291
My time's not up yet.

35:07.375 --> 35:09.208
We still have 30 minutes
before your deadline.

35:09.291 --> 35:11.041
I expect you to honor it.
Mercer out.

35:20.291 --> 35:21.792
Okay, we're cloaked.

35:21.875 --> 35:23.166
The<i> Orville </i>won't be able
to follow us.

35:23.250 --> 35:24.583
Now, what's the plan?

35:24.667 --> 35:27.417
Set a course to rendezvous
with the Krill ship.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.542
What?

35:29.625 --> 35:31.166
Just do it.
Trust me.

35:31.250 --> 35:33.375
Look, if-if you just tell me
what the plan is...

35:33.458 --> 35:35.166
Gordon.
Trust me.

35:38.917 --> 35:41.959
Captain, the shuttle
has changed course

35:42.041 --> 35:43.709
to intercept the Krill vessel.

35:43.792 --> 35:45.834
My God, what is he doing?

35:45.917 --> 35:47.333
I have no idea.

35:47.417 --> 35:49.000
Maybe we should contact him.

35:49.083 --> 35:50.792
Then Orrin will know
it's a setup.

35:50.875 --> 35:52.959
Gordon's got to contact us.

36:01.917 --> 36:04.834
Hey.
Can I come in?

36:08.750 --> 36:10.625
Thought I'd stop by
and check on you.

36:10.709 --> 36:13.250
I'm sure it's been
a stressful day.

36:13.333 --> 36:14.959
I know you're probably wondering

36:15.041 --> 36:16.625
what's going on
with your father.

36:16.709 --> 36:19.083
All I can tell you is...

36:21.875 --> 36:23.250
What happened to your arm?

36:26.291 --> 36:27.667
Who did that to you?

36:29.542 --> 36:31.291
Look, I know you're scared
of the doctor,

36:31.375 --> 36:33.166
but we have to get that
checked out.

36:33.250 --> 36:34.750
Keyali to Finn.

36:34.834 --> 36:38.083
I need you in Lieutenant
Channing's quarters right away.

36:38.166 --> 36:40.125
Tell her to belay that order.

36:49.542 --> 36:51.458
Well, look at that.
She talks.

36:51.542 --> 36:52.875
Damn right she talks.

36:52.959 --> 36:56.250
Now tell her
to belay that order.<i> Now. </i>

36:56.333 --> 36:58.250
You ever met a Xelayan before?

36:58.333 --> 37:00.166
(scoffs)
No.

37:02.542 --> 37:03.959
You have now.

37:09.166 --> 37:10.458
What the hell?

37:14.917 --> 37:16.625
CLAIRE:
Oh, my...

37:16.709 --> 37:18.709
Talla, step away from her.

37:18.792 --> 37:21.709
-Doctor, what's...
-Step away from her right now.

37:21.792 --> 37:23.625
You're too late.

37:27.333 --> 37:28.291
Lock it.

37:30.417 --> 37:32.458
-Doctor,
you mind telling me what...
-Finn to bridge.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.333
<i>You need to set up</i>
<i>a force field</i>

37:34.417 --> 37:35.959
<i>around Lieutenant Channing's</i>
<i>quarters immediately.</i>

37:36.041 --> 37:37.500
<i>Divert all available power.</i>

37:37.583 --> 37:38.875
Strong as you can make it.

37:38.959 --> 37:40.458
-Doctor, what's going on?
<i>-CLAIRE: Please,</i>

37:40.542 --> 37:42.083
just do it.
And initiate

37:42.166 --> 37:43.834
a nitrogen purge
in those quarters.

37:43.917 --> 37:46.000
-Isaac.
-Yes, Captain.

37:47.125 --> 37:49.250
Level 12 force field

37:49.333 --> 37:51.208
activated around guest quarters.

37:53.375 --> 37:55.375
-Come on.
-Hey, wait.

37:55.458 --> 37:57.709
I want answers. What do you know
about Channing's daughter?

37:57.792 --> 38:01.125
Whoever that woman in there is,
it's not his daughter.

38:04.500 --> 38:07.458
That's why she wouldn't submit
to a medical exam.

38:07.542 --> 38:08.875
She's an Envall.

38:08.959 --> 38:10.333
Oh, my God.

38:10.417 --> 38:11.500
What's an Envall?

38:11.583 --> 38:13.333
It's a race of humanoids

38:13.417 --> 38:16.000
from a distant star system
called Lakkar B.

38:16.083 --> 38:19.417
Their blood cells contain
an iodide compound which,

38:19.500 --> 38:21.959
when exposed
to a nitrogen-rich atmosphere,

38:22.041 --> 38:24.083
renders the plasma
highly unstable.

38:24.166 --> 38:25.500
Wait, so you're saying...

38:25.583 --> 38:26.542
When their blood hits the air,

38:26.625 --> 38:27.959
it becomes
an explosive substance.

38:28.041 --> 38:29.583
You're lucky you didn't
blow the ship half apart

38:29.667 --> 38:30.875
when you decked her.

38:30.959 --> 38:32.500
KELLY:
Their homeworld's atmosphere

38:32.583 --> 38:34.375
includes an element
that neutralizes the effect,

38:34.458 --> 38:36.375
but they're
too biologically dangerous

38:36.458 --> 38:37.875
for us to interact with.

38:37.959 --> 38:40.208
So, 50 years ago, they made
an agreement with the Union

38:40.291 --> 38:42.375
to stay away from any worlds
with nitrogen atmospheres.

38:42.458 --> 38:44.375
And that's why most of us
have never seen one.

38:44.458 --> 38:46.500
Where did Lieutenant Channing
find her?

38:46.583 --> 38:47.792
Who knows?

38:47.875 --> 38:50.917
Could Orrin have been
extracting her blood

38:51.000 --> 38:52.458
to use as a weapon?

38:52.542 --> 38:54.458
The needle marks on her arm.

38:54.542 --> 38:55.709
Oh, why would he use a needle?

38:55.792 --> 38:58.625
The blood is too unstable to use
an electron hypodermic.

38:58.709 --> 39:00.542
That's why he stole
the quantum storage cells--

39:00.625 --> 39:02.333
to transport it.

39:02.417 --> 39:05.000
And that's how he destroyed
those Krill ships,

39:05.083 --> 39:07.375
by firing compressed units
of Envall blood

39:07.458 --> 39:09.375
from the Krill shuttle's
torpedo launchers.

39:09.458 --> 39:11.834
Union shuttles do not have
torpedo launchers.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.834
How is he planning
to deploy the weapon?

39:13.917 --> 39:15.583
He isn't.

39:15.667 --> 39:17.208
It's a suicide mission.

39:17.291 --> 39:18.583
With Gordon on board.

39:18.667 --> 39:19.417
John, take the helm.

39:19.500 --> 39:20.959
Set a course
to intercept the shuttle.

39:31.333 --> 39:34.375
Six minutes to intercept
the Krill vessel. Okay, Orrin,

39:34.458 --> 39:36.458
you got to tell me what
we're doing, or I'm stopping

39:36.542 --> 39:38.333
right here.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.625
What is that?

39:50.709 --> 39:52.583
Justice.

39:52.667 --> 39:54.166
Looks more like eggnog.

39:54.250 --> 39:55.583
It's Envall blood.

39:55.667 --> 39:57.417
Just a few ounces of this

39:57.500 --> 39:59.625
is enough to destroy
a starship's quantum drive.

39:59.709 --> 40:01.875
Where did you get Envall blood?

40:03.959 --> 40:06.709
Leyna was killed by the Krill
20 years ago along with my wife.

40:08.667 --> 40:11.875
The girl you met is an Envall
I encountered at an outpost

40:11.959 --> 40:14.458
after I escaped the POW camp.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.542
She hates the Krill
for her own reasons,

40:16.625 --> 40:19.208
so we joined forces.

40:19.291 --> 40:21.417
You<i> did </i>destroy
those Krill ships.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.667
With great pleasure.

40:27.667 --> 40:29.542
Malloy to<i> Orville. </i>

40:29.625 --> 40:31.250
I'm returning
to the shuttle bay.

40:31.333 --> 40:32.458
What are you doing?

40:32.542 --> 40:34.625
You son of a bitch.
You lied to me!

40:34.709 --> 40:36.291
Gordon, listen to me.
We have to do this.

40:36.375 --> 40:37.542
Look, I understand
what you went through

40:37.625 --> 40:38.792
was a nightmare, but you...

40:38.875 --> 40:41.000
You don't understand
a damn thing!

40:41.083 --> 40:42.792
You've had a life!
For 20 years,

40:42.875 --> 40:45.208
all I've had is loneliness
and brutality

40:45.291 --> 40:47.417
and all the time in the world
to relive the memory

40:47.500 --> 40:48.792
of watching my family die!

40:48.875 --> 40:50.291
I'm sorry, Orrin!

40:50.375 --> 40:52.500
War is hell on all sides,

40:52.583 --> 40:55.375
but this agreement
can stop the killing.

40:59.583 --> 41:01.417
(both grunting)

41:30.834 --> 41:31.917
Orrin, it's over.

41:36.250 --> 41:37.542
What are you doing?

41:37.625 --> 41:40.750
We can intercept the Krill ship
and do what we came here to do,

41:40.834 --> 41:42.500
or we can die here.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.709
Orrin, please.
Don't do this.

41:44.792 --> 41:46.583
It's too late.
It can't be stopped.

41:46.667 --> 41:48.750
If you won't set the course,
I will.

41:54.834 --> 41:56.750
Do you realize
what you've done?

42:03.792 --> 42:04.667
(inhales sharply)

42:04.750 --> 42:06.125
Put this on.

42:06.208 --> 42:07.542
Go to hell, Malloy.

42:16.875 --> 42:18.667
How long till we intercept
the shuttle?

42:18.750 --> 42:19.959
Three minutes.

42:20.041 --> 42:22.542
-Run every red light.
-Aye, sir.

42:24.834 --> 42:27.667
Orrin, we have to abandon ship.

42:27.750 --> 42:28.917
Now put the suit on.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.750
Ungrateful bastard.
I saved your life.

42:31.834 --> 42:33.250
And I'll always be in your debt,

42:33.333 --> 42:36.125
but asking me to commit
kamikaze suicide with you

42:36.208 --> 42:37.750
is kind of a backpedal,
don't you think?

42:37.834 --> 42:40.417
Go.

42:40.500 --> 42:42.625
Orrin.

42:42.709 --> 42:44.583
I don't want to lose you again.

Hey.

Listen, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

45:47.041 --> 45:50.667
It's not easy to have to put
duty before friendship,

45:50.750 --> 45:53.291
especially when someone dies.

45:55.500 --> 45:59.417
Orrin died a long time ago,
back in that Krill prison.

46:00.500 --> 46:02.542
The man who died in that shuttle

46:02.625 --> 46:04.709
was somebody else.

46:06.542 --> 46:09.959
Well, I also wanted
to say that...

46:10.041 --> 46:13.208
I think you may have been right.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.792
I may have felt
a little threatened

46:17.875 --> 46:19.792
by your friendship with Orrin.

46:19.875 --> 46:22.500
Dude, that's insane.
Why?

46:23.625 --> 46:25.959
Because every moment

46:26.041 --> 46:28.750
that I sit in that chair
on the bridge,

46:28.834 --> 46:32.458
I'm always wondering,
"Do I deserve this?

46:32.542 --> 46:35.041
I mean, should this
be someone else?"

46:35.125 --> 46:38.041
And that's something
I can never vocalize

46:38.125 --> 46:39.417
to any other member of the crew,

46:39.500 --> 46:41.875
because they would
lose confidence.

46:41.959 --> 46:44.875
I mean, I can
talk to Kelly, but...

46:44.959 --> 46:48.750
that's been
a little complicated lately.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.166
I count on you, man.

46:52.250 --> 46:55.083
Dude, you can
always count on me.

46:55.166 --> 46:56.959
That's never gonna change.

46:57.041 --> 46:59.041
You're my best friend.

46:59.125 --> 47:01.750
Nobody's ever gonna come along
and mess it up, I swear.

47:03.250 --> 47:04.834
I mean, maybe, like,
a really hot girl,

47:04.917 --> 47:06.709
but other than that,
it's rock-solid.

47:06.792 --> 47:09.000

Thanks.

47:12.917 --> 47:14.875
Well, look, it's after shift,

47:14.959 --> 47:16.959
so why don't we go get a beer,

47:17.041 --> 47:19.166
and you can tell me
about your friend.
