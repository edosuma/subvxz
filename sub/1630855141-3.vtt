WEBVTT

04:05.746 --> 04:07.497
Should've known you'd be early.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.293
You look tired already.

04:12.169 --> 04:15.255
I was hoping to meet Juliette Nichols
before you keel over.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.841
We'll see who gets tuckered out.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.095
- After you.
- Thank you.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.034
You dead?

04:45.827 --> 04:47.329
Bet you wish you were.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.082
Come on, you're late.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.712
How did you get in here?

04:56.255 --> 04:57.756
Your door was open.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.300
You threw up in the hallway.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.803
And by the smell of it,
pretty much everywhere.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.557
- Could you talk about something else?
- You mean something other than vomit?

05:06.557 --> 05:08.892
You don't want me talking about puking?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.019
Go.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.984
Why you wearing that again?

05:19.611 --> 05:21.363
You gonna tell me what's going on?

05:23.198 --> 05:24.700
You're not a drinker, Jules.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.076
Not a good one, no.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.370
Here.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.169
Hey, come on. Talk to me.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.343
Shit. My fix is failing.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.827
- Water?
- Sure.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.538
Here.

06:14.583 --> 06:18.504
Unless you dumped water to lighten
your load, I think you got a leak.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.674
You wanna say hello to the judge?

06:24.510 --> 06:27.679
But you do want her goons to be sure
and see you standing here.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.443
Hey!

06:43.320 --> 06:44.321
Get out of there!

06:46.198 --> 06:47.908
- No, I was just gonna do s--
- No!

06:48.534 --> 06:50.744
- Juliette, how am I supposed to learn--
- No! Enough!

07:19.481 --> 07:21.567
You wanna tell me what's going on?

07:24.403 --> 07:25.863
'Cause I'm at a damn loss.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.115
You told Cooper to go in.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.033
Was I supposed to wait for you to show up?

07:31.326 --> 07:34.496
- Really incredible smell, by the way.
- You know my rules.

07:34.496 --> 07:35.581
Your rules?

07:36.123 --> 07:38.959
Last I heard, I'm the head of Mechanical,
and you're my shadow.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.545
Though I can't remember the last time
you actually listened to me.

07:41.545 --> 07:45.257
- Only I go through the hatch.
- So you feel okay about decking Coop?

07:45.257 --> 07:48.218
Jules, he's your shadow.
The kid fucking worships you.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.721
It's my job to make sure it's running.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.015
And you care so much
that you showed up two hours late.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.933
We're putting off the inevitable.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.936
We have to shut it down
and make a real fix.

07:57.936 --> 08:01.899
Jules, I can't be the first guy
in the history of the Silo

08:01.899 --> 08:04.318
- to shut the generator down.
- Better it happen on our terms

08:04.318 --> 08:06.445
with the backup running
than the rotor shattering--

08:06.445 --> 08:08.447
Even an hour in darkness
will be utter chaos.

08:08.447 --> 08:10.407
- Nothing compared to what's gonna happen--
- Jules.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.576
It's fucking better it happens
on our terms

08:12.576 --> 08:15.245
- than the rotor shattering!
- Jules, I'll tell you what.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.330
Fucking hell.

08:19.124 --> 08:19.958
I'll tell you what.

08:21.084 --> 08:26.089
We'll have this discussion tomorrow
when you're not hungover or still drunk.

08:28.884 --> 08:29.885
Go home.

08:30.427 --> 08:34.056
Wash off whatever it is I'm smelling
and take your punishment.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.434
You punched Cooper in the face.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.979
You either gotta do a day
on the trash line

08:40.979 --> 08:42.940
or work off some tickets with Walker.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.277
Can't I just let him punch me back?

08:50.739 --> 08:53.867
I was gonna come out to applaud.
Walking the Silo at--

08:53.867 --> 08:56.662
If you say "at your age,"
you don't get what I brought you.

08:56.662 --> 08:57.829
What did you bring me?

08:58.413 --> 09:01.625
Just a little token of my gratitude
for all we've done together.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.127
Well, gee,
I'm glad somebody's getting something.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.755
I joined her on this march of death,

09:06.755 --> 09:08.715
and she hasn't given me anything
but grief.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.593
You must really want something.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.555
Well, I might need a little help
with our friend in the robe.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.056
Judge Meadows.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.017
No, you're gonna need a lot of help.

09:19.643 --> 09:23.564
Her office messaged me
and said you neglected to stop by.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.867
Do you want Paul Billings to be sheriff?

09:35.659 --> 09:38.453
Mayor, you know me.
Doesn't matter what I want.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.122
You just run the numbers.

09:40.122 --> 09:43.834
Which tell me that Paul Billings
is the most favorable candidate.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.044
Is that for the Silo, or is that for IT?

09:47.796 --> 09:49.590
What did your numbers say about Holston?

09:49.590 --> 09:54.052
They said he'd be a great sheriff,
which he was until he wasn't.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.971
I wonder what your numbers say about me.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.806
Fuck the numbers. You brought brandy.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.018
What do they say about Juliette Nichols?

10:01.018 --> 10:02.644
She's an engineer in Mechanical.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.229
I know who she is.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.649
- I don't need her numbers. She's a thief.
- Thief?

10:07.649 --> 10:08.734
Her record's clean.

10:08.734 --> 10:12.946
She stole four boxes of H57 tape
reserved for IT.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.740
- She stole tape.
- Not just any tape.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.451
Heat tape we use to prevent our servers
from cooking.

10:18.327 --> 10:22.164
And honestly,
the problem isn't what she stole.

10:22.831 --> 10:26.835
- It's the fact that she stole at all.
- Bernard, she was Holston's pick.

10:27.878 --> 10:30.214
Mayor, you can't seriously consider her.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.425
Deputy.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.677
- Doesn't matter what he thinks.
- I'm just the escort.

10:35.677 --> 10:39.348
I don't like Judicial's choice
being shoved down my throat.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.975
Mayor, bringing me a bottle of brandy

10:41.975 --> 10:45.646
is not going to help you
win a turf battle with Judge Meadows.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.022
It's good brandy.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.316
It could be from the before times
for all I care.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.611
Here are some other numbers
you should consider.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.864
Every hour the Silo is without a sheriff,

10:55.864 --> 10:59.493
the probability of catastrophe
increases by one point.

10:59.493 --> 11:03.080
While we're sitting here chitchatting,
frightened citizens are arming themselves,

11:03.080 --> 11:05.624
because they don't know
who's going to protect them.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.085
Billings is a good choice.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.045
Just make him sheriff,

11:10.045 --> 11:14.800
and leave walking the Silo to kids
with nothing better to do.

11:30.774 --> 11:31.775
She's coming.

11:33.986 --> 11:34.987
She's coming.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.830
- Couldn't help yourself, could you?
- So I sent word.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.665
They need us now, Sam.

11:46.665 --> 11:48.792
Mayor! Welcome to the Mids.

11:49.751 --> 11:53.046
- Welcome to the Mids, Mayor Jahns!
- Hi. Hello!

11:53.672 --> 11:57.384
I know it's been a long time
since I crossed this bridge.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.261
In fact, I can see a couple of men

11:59.261 --> 12:01.763
who were pimply teenagers
last time I was here.

12:04.224 --> 12:08.270
I came to look you all in the eye
and remind you how important you are.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.023
We're all scared.

12:11.023 --> 12:15.611
We lost a great man and a fine sheriff,
but it's this community.

12:15.611 --> 12:19.573
It's the way you love each other
that truly holds the Silo together

12:20.449 --> 12:22.743
even when times are tough, like now.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.995
We love you, Mayor Jahns.

12:24.995 --> 12:28.123
I'm voting for you in the next election.
We're all voting for you.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.208
Yes.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.669
Now, I have business down below,

12:32.669 --> 12:36.381
but I'm not gonna leave this level
till I see the babies.

12:37.549 --> 12:41.261
- This is Jacob, Mayor Jahns.
- Lovely. Very good to see you.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.355
This is Harry.

12:52.064 --> 12:54.775
Harry was in a hurry.
Came out three weeks early.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.485
But he's doing well.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.905
As I recall from your last visit,

12:59.905 --> 13:02.282
you like to say hello
to any mothers-to-be.

13:02.282 --> 13:06.453
Actually, Doctor, we were hoping
for a moment with you alone.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.122
Sure.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.708
We were hoping to talk to you
about your daughter, Juliette.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.339
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.633
She's being considered for a new position.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.594
Just the standard vetting.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.514
- Any questions I can answer?
- How come she lives down deep?

13:25.514 --> 13:29.476
You understand it is unusual
for someone born in the Mids

13:29.476 --> 13:33.689
with a doctor for a father
to end up in Mechanical.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.361
Our troubles started.

13:43.115 --> 13:44.658
It was hard on Jules.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.411
A loss like that...

13:50.581 --> 13:53.542
She showed real interest in machines
from an early age.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.921
Always figuring out how things worked,
how to fix them if they didn't.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.467
I think it felt good
to be able to fix something.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.264
She was a little young,
but I supported her decision to go.

14:07.264 --> 14:10.100
- How old was she when she left?
- Thirteen.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.685
When did you last speak to her?

14:14.438 --> 14:15.439
It's been a while.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.484
I have new babies every week.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.946
Jules has the generator.
It's a long walk down to Mechanical.

14:22.946 --> 14:27.576
I can't get there and back on my day off.
I need that day to rest.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.206
Well. If that's all,
I have an expectant mother in breech,

14:32.206 --> 14:34.583
and I need to get baby turned around.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.762
More questions than answers.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.600
It's so hard to describe.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.520
What you saw or what you felt?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.855
- No, I felt fine.
- Okay.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.234
It wasn't the darkness
I was worried about. I--

15:01.527 --> 15:03.195
- I just felt--
- Scared.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.780
No, I didn't feel scared.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.199
- If I was scared, I'd tell you.
- Okay.

15:09.326 --> 15:11.495
Okay, fuck. Yeah, I felt scared. I--

15:15.207 --> 15:16.583
That much water, it's--

15:17.793 --> 15:20.128
<i>It was just more water
than I've ever seen.</i>

15:23.507 --> 15:25.717
It was more than that. I had just--

15:28.762 --> 15:30.097
You know, George, he--

15:31.640 --> 15:36.728
He left me all these clues,
and I couldn't do it.

15:38.397 --> 15:40.148
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't go down there.

15:40.148 --> 15:44.820
- That's what I feel. I feel pissed off.
- So pissed off you took it out on Cooper.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.030
- I don't wanna talk about Cooper.
- What do you want?

15:47.030 --> 15:49.700
I don't know. I just wanna...

15:51.535 --> 15:52.911
Run away.

15:53.996 --> 15:57.040
It's okay. I get that. I get it.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.378
You know, we scream, we fight, we get mad.

16:01.378 --> 16:04.590
But every now and then,
we should tell ourselves,

16:04.590 --> 16:07.926
- "We did what we could. We did our best."
- "We." Really? "We"?

16:07.926 --> 16:10.929
I don't even know why I'm getting advice
from someone who sits at her bench

16:10.929 --> 16:13.098
every day listening to the radio.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.893
You haven't left the workshop in 20 years.

16:17.269 --> 16:18.687
Twenty fucking years!

16:31.366 --> 16:34.244
<i>Did I ever tell you
about the first arrest I made?</i>

16:34.995 --> 16:37.206
It was right here in this park,
right over there.

16:37.206 --> 16:41.710
3:00 a.m. Drunk, naked couple going at it.
That was my first arrest.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.420
You know what my second arrest was?

16:43.420 --> 16:47.382
Twenty-four hours later. Same drunken
couple going at it right there.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.343
It's a true story.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.805
Aren't you gonna miss it? The job?

16:54.431 --> 16:55.557
It's time.

16:55.557 --> 16:59.228
I was thinking that maybe I might open up
a stall in the market,

16:59.228 --> 17:04.691
try to sell my drawings to anybody
blind enough to want 'em.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.069
I honestly don't know what I'm gonna do.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.656
I always thought Holston
would take over from me.

17:11.656 --> 17:16.369
Compliments of Judge Meadows.
Strawberries fresh from the farm.

17:16.369 --> 17:20.082
If you haven't tried this, don't.
One bite can be habit-forming.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.875
Is this supposed to intimidate me?

17:21.875 --> 17:22.792
Dessert?

17:24.002 --> 17:25.503
No. I wanted to make sure you--

17:25.503 --> 17:28.423
Anything swimming in
that much sugar is bad for the heart.

17:28.423 --> 17:32.845
Then I blew it. It was supposed to be
a friendly gesture and a little nudge.

17:33.428 --> 17:37.474
- You didn't stop by to see Judge Meadows.
- I didn't know I was supposed to.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.101
Mayor, the second Holston went out,

17:39.101 --> 17:41.103
the clock started
on finding his replacement.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.313
I understand why you'd wanna pay Holston

17:43.313 --> 17:45.691
the respect of at least meeting
with his pick.

17:46.191 --> 17:48.569
- Bernard told you, I see.
- There really isn't time.

17:48.569 --> 17:50.946
Paul Billings is a good choice.

17:50.946 --> 17:54.032
He's a family man,
dedicated, hardworking, smart.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.492
- He cares about the people.
- Mr. Sims.

17:55.492 --> 17:58.078
I'll make my decision
when I've completed my trip.

18:03.417 --> 18:05.586
- Sam, you want it?
- No, Rob, I'm good.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.325
<i>Suicide is a serious crime.</i>

18:36.325 --> 18:37.868
<i>No, it wasn't suicide.</i>

18:37.868 --> 18:39.369
So you've said.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.720
"What I was looking for."

19:18.534 --> 19:20.953
Fuck!

19:28.961 --> 19:32.506
- That's not good.
- No shit. Where's Jules?

19:50.232 --> 19:51.275
Knox.

19:51.984 --> 19:54.069
Madam Mayor. Deputy.

19:54.695 --> 19:55.863
We weren't expecting you--

19:55.863 --> 19:57.281
Everything all right?

19:57.281 --> 20:00.117
- Yeah. It's all under control.
- Do you want us to come back or--

20:00.117 --> 20:01.994
It's not supposed to sound
like that, is it?

20:04.454 --> 20:05.289
No, ma'am.

20:17.968 --> 20:20.387
- What's going on?
- The fix is failing again.

20:21.138 --> 20:22.139
Yeah, I can see that.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.229
- I've tried switching--
- I need to listen.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.283
Is that her?

20:41.283 --> 20:42.367
Yeah.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.335
Excuse me, Madam Mayor.

20:51.335 --> 20:52.836
- What's going on?
- Don't worry.

21:00.302 --> 21:01.470
Jules!

21:02.179 --> 21:04.014
- The vibration's changed.
- What?

21:04.014 --> 21:06.475
It's shifted. All this time,

21:06.475 --> 21:08.185
- the vibration's been moving it--
- This way.

21:08.185 --> 21:10.687
- And now it's going that way.
- Shit.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.524
- So, what do we do?
- You leave. Check the output.

21:13.524 --> 21:15.275
Hey, everybody, back.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.444
- Back. Come on.
- Jules, I can help.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.404
I know this generator
just as much as any--

21:19.404 --> 21:21.365
Coop! You're her shadow.

21:21.365 --> 21:23.700
We can't have you both up here
if this goes sideways.

21:26.662 --> 21:29.498
Close it behind me.
This is what I was warning you about.

21:29.498 --> 21:30.624
I know.

21:32.960 --> 21:33.961
Good luck.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.137
Fuck.

22:08.078 --> 22:09.079
Don't let her leave.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.707
- Hey, Madam Mayor?
- I'll be fine.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.388
If I'd known
I was getting a visit from the mayor,

22:27.222 --> 22:28.599
I'd have tidied up.

22:28.599 --> 22:30.309
You don't tidy up for old friends.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.604
Besides, you knew I was coming.

22:33.604 --> 22:35.522
You heard it on the radio you made.

22:36.315 --> 22:39.234
Which is so prohibited by the Pact,
I don't know where to start.

22:39.234 --> 22:44.489
You up-toppers really don't know
your machines, do you? That's a toaster.

22:49.328 --> 22:51.079
I was sad your marriage broke up.

22:52.581 --> 22:54.082
Was 25 years ago.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.250
I was still sad.

22:56.001 --> 22:58.253
You and Carla were a good couple.
What happened?

22:59.755 --> 23:01.256
She chewed with her mouth open.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.677
What can I do for you, Ruth?

23:05.677 --> 23:06.929
Juliette Nichols.

23:07.804 --> 23:10.140
- What about her?
- I need your honest opinion of her.

23:11.350 --> 23:13.310
Who is she, Martha?

23:25.113 --> 23:26.615
Am I under arrest or something?

23:28.408 --> 23:29.576
Should you be?

23:34.748 --> 23:36.625
- Juliette.
- Uh-huh.

23:37.167 --> 23:38.210
I'm Mayor Jahns.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.465
Could we have a moment?

23:44.132 --> 23:44.967
Sure.

23:46.677 --> 23:47.678
Can't you just stay?

23:48.554 --> 23:49.555
You got this.

23:56.645 --> 24:00.274
One of my duties as mayor
is appointing the next sheriff.

24:00.274 --> 24:04.945
One of the Silo traditions is that
the outgoing sheriff leaves a suggestion

24:04.945 --> 24:10.158
as to who should be next to wear the star.
Holston Becker chose you.

24:12.536 --> 24:14.705
- I'm sorry, what?
- I must tell you,

24:14.705 --> 24:18.083
- no one wants you for this job.
- Okay.

24:18.083 --> 24:23.130
Except for one deceased former sheriff
and me.

24:27.176 --> 24:28.552
I know it's a lot to take in.

24:34.141 --> 24:35.267
No.

24:35.809 --> 24:38.145
- Pardon?
- I don't want it.

24:38.145 --> 24:39.605
Hallelujah.

24:40.731 --> 24:42.191
May I ask why?

24:42.191 --> 24:47.654
Everyone thinks their job in the Silo
is the most important. Mine actually is.

24:49.448 --> 24:51.575
The generator, she's not well.

24:51.575 --> 24:54.620
And if I'm not here
to make sure she's running and--

24:57.915 --> 24:59.249
I have to take care of her.

24:59.750 --> 25:01.710
Well, that is too bad.

25:03.045 --> 25:05.881
Holston wanted you to have this...

25:09.176 --> 25:10.594
whether or not you took the job.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.192
Take care, Juliette.

25:45.546 --> 25:46.839
What the fuck?

25:52.719 --> 25:53.846
Stop cheating.

25:53.846 --> 25:54.930
Come on.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.734
- Wow.
- That makes no sense.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.320
You? Sheriff?

26:10.320 --> 26:11.405
Yeah.

26:12.489 --> 26:13.824
- Why?
- I don't know.

26:13.824 --> 26:15.534
Because you get shit done.

26:15.534 --> 26:18.996
- You'd be a great sheriff.
- Coop, you don't have to suck up.

26:18.996 --> 26:21.123
- She's not gonna hit you again.
- It should be you, Hank.

26:21.874 --> 26:23.292
They'd make him cut his hair.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.420
- Can I see it?
- Yeah, sure.

26:30.841 --> 26:34.887
You know, Sheriff Holston was the reason
I wanted to become a deputy.

26:34.887 --> 26:38.223
I mean
what do I know about law enforcement? I--

26:38.223 --> 26:40.142
What did you know about being an engineer?

26:40.809 --> 26:43.896
- Not a whole lot.
- Hey. What's this?

26:45.564 --> 26:47.900
Something's carved
in the back of the badge.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.788
Mayor Jahns!

27:03.415 --> 27:04.583
I changed my mind.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.628
I'll take the job.

27:08.378 --> 27:10.714
- Well, that's wonderful.
- On one condition.

27:10.714 --> 27:11.798
There's a condition?

27:12.299 --> 27:13.759
I need to fix the generator.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.304
I can't leave Mechanical
without knowing it's safe.

27:17.304 --> 27:20.265
- Okay.
- And in order to fix the generator...

27:22.684 --> 27:24.061
I need to shut it down.

27:25.187 --> 27:28.524
You need to shut down the generator?
Put us all in the dark?

27:29.107 --> 27:31.360
- We've got a backup.
- Which provides minimal power.

27:31.944 --> 27:33.612
Barely enough for life support.

27:33.612 --> 27:36.031
What you're asking for,
that has never been done.

27:36.031 --> 27:37.241
No. I--

27:38.283 --> 27:40.035
- I know.
- People would be terrified.

27:40.035 --> 27:44.206
People are gonna be terrified
when the rotor shatters,

27:44.206 --> 27:47.251
and we're living off the backup
in darkness.

27:48.544 --> 27:49.545
Forever.

27:54.925 --> 27:55.926
I can do it.

27:59.429 --> 28:01.682
<i>In order to repair the generator,</i>

28:01.682 --> 28:05.394
<i>an eight-hour power outage
will begin tonight at 10:00 p.m.</i>

28:05.394 --> 28:08.856
<i>The Silo will be completely dark
for that period.</i>

28:08.856 --> 28:11.608
<i>You are ordered to gather
in the designated safe zones</i>

28:11.608 --> 28:16.363
<i>or to stay at home.
Those failing to comply will be jailed.</i>

28:28.083 --> 28:29.793
That's how the rotor
should be spinning, right?

28:30.752 --> 28:34.464
So sometime in the last 30 years,
something damaged it.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.592
- What?
- I don't know.

28:36.592 --> 28:38.969
Maybe someone dropped
a tool from the catwalk.

28:38.969 --> 28:43.348
- How much damage?
- All it takes is one tiny dent.

28:45.893 --> 28:50.522
That's gonna create a small wobble
that gradually builds into a large wobble.

28:51.190 --> 28:53.650
Doesn't matter how many times
we tweak the alignment.

28:53.650 --> 28:56.862
- It always moves out of place.
- So soon the entire thing is gonna break,

28:56.862 --> 29:00.616
which means we can't make enough juice
to power up a single level,

29:00.616 --> 29:02.159
let alone the entire Silo.

29:04.995 --> 29:06.496
So how do we fix it?

29:07.497 --> 29:10.125
First, we're gonna open it up
and see where it's broken.

29:10.834 --> 29:15.672
Then, to fix whatever's wrong, we're
gonna have to shut down the generator.

29:15.672 --> 29:18.425
And did you tell the mayor
we can't actually do that?

29:18.425 --> 29:19.885
Sure, we can.

29:19.885 --> 29:21.887
Knox controls the steam flow
from down here.

29:21.887 --> 29:23.555
And if he turns it off,

29:23.555 --> 29:25.724
how much time do you think
we'll have before it blows up?

29:25.724 --> 29:27.309
- Blows up?
- I don't know.

29:29.978 --> 29:33.190
- I don't know. An hour?
- If you get half that, you'll be lucky.

29:34.191 --> 29:35.567
Lemme show you why.

29:39.738 --> 29:41.490
We don't know
what we're dealing with here,

29:41.490 --> 29:43.784
so we've all gotta be ready.
Expect the worst.

29:43.784 --> 29:46.036
Any issues, radio me here,

29:46.036 --> 29:47.704
and I'll coordinate
with the other stations.

29:47.704 --> 29:50.749
Be alert. We don't know what to expect.

29:52.084 --> 29:54.253
Everyone be safe out there.

29:55.963 --> 29:57.923
Molly, you and your team
head out on patrol.

29:57.923 --> 30:01.385
- Let everyone know you're there.
- You know what to do. Let's get to it.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.556
Hey, if it stays quiet,
there's a cot in holding,

30:05.556 --> 30:08.100
and the sofa in my office pulls out.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.352
- Wouldn't say either are comfortable.
- Good to know.

30:10.352 --> 30:12.813
Now, could you escort the mayor
to the hostel, please?

30:13.313 --> 30:14.815
- I'll stay here.
- No.

30:14.815 --> 30:18.277
It'll be quiet, but I wanna know
how things are going in the Silo.

30:22.489 --> 30:24.491
- Night. Ma'am.
- See you in the morning.

30:30.497 --> 30:33.000
As far as we know,
the Silo's never been on backup power

30:33.000 --> 30:36.211
- and you think it'll be quiet?
- Tonight they'll just be afraid.

30:36.211 --> 30:38.797
And tomorrow,
if the lights don't come back on?

30:39.673 --> 30:41.508
Hope you have the combination
to the gun safe.

30:45.637 --> 30:49.057
The steam comes in from way down deep.
No one knows from where.

30:50.017 --> 30:52.269
All we know is that it comes up
through this pipe,

30:52.269 --> 30:54.563
makes this bend,
and goes straight up to the turbine.

30:54.563 --> 30:56.064
Now, the founders were smart.

30:56.648 --> 31:00.277
They knew they couldn't control how the
steam behaved, so they built in a safety.

31:00.861 --> 31:02.446
This is the containment chamber.

31:02.446 --> 31:05.824
It protects the turbine in case
there's a sudden surge

31:05.824 --> 31:07.618
and someone needs to regulate the flow.

31:08.660 --> 31:14.124
You wanna stop the generator? Knox has
to close this main valve all the way.

31:15.375 --> 31:17.044
That happens, you get about 30 minutes

31:17.044 --> 31:19.588
before the pressure redlines,
and he needs to release it.

31:20.714 --> 31:22.299
We're gonna need more time.

31:23.133 --> 31:24.551
Can we keep it in the red?

31:24.551 --> 31:27.763
We could if steam was cold,
but it's not because it's steam.

31:28.263 --> 31:30.224
The more pressure it's under,
the hotter it gets.

31:30.224 --> 31:34.144
And that pressure just keeps on building
until it blows.

31:34.144 --> 31:36.438
So, 30 minutes before redline?

31:36.438 --> 31:37.814
At most.

31:39.525 --> 31:40.400
Boss?

31:43.570 --> 31:46.073
The mayor's authorized
eight hours on backup.

31:46.073 --> 31:50.702
Once we switch over, the crew will
get to work detaching panels C and D.

31:50.702 --> 31:51.787
Both?

31:51.787 --> 31:53.539
It's the only way to assess what's inside.

31:53.539 --> 31:56.250
- They must weigh--
- 1.35 tons. Each.

31:59.586 --> 32:03.257
Guys, there's no part of this that's easy.

32:05.467 --> 32:09.471
The slightest mistake at any point
could get somebody killed,

32:09.471 --> 32:12.891
or worse,
leave 10,000 people in the dark forever.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.563
Put five of our strongest guys
on each panel.

32:17.563 --> 32:21.692
Once they're open,
I'll slow the generator down to 50%,

32:21.692 --> 32:24.111
but I won't stop it. Not yet.

32:26.196 --> 32:27.739
We'll identify the problem.

32:27.739 --> 32:29.700
Then Jules will signal to me
when she's ready.

32:30.534 --> 32:31.785
At that point,

32:31.785 --> 32:34.496
I'll shut the steam valve
and stop the generator.

32:36.081 --> 32:39.626
Our 30 minutes starts right then.
All right?

32:40.169 --> 32:41.336
Yep.

32:42.129 --> 32:44.339
Now, Jules,
who do you want up there with you?

32:50.137 --> 32:53.015
All right. Let's get to it! Come on!

33:16.872 --> 33:18.373
That's right. Stay off the stairs.

33:18.373 --> 33:22.127
Stay off the s-- Back inside, please, sir.
Ma'am-- Thank you.

33:31.678 --> 33:32.679
Go ahead.

33:34.556 --> 33:35.891
Switching to backup.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.112
Backup's holding steady.

34:34.199 --> 34:36.159
Cutting steam to 50%.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.380
Go ahead and start on the panels.

35:31.048 --> 35:32.049
It's incredible.

35:35.427 --> 35:36.428
Okay.

35:37.387 --> 35:38.472
That's where I gotta go.

35:57.533 --> 35:59.368
Hey! You okay?

36:01.286 --> 36:03.622
When we get up there,
we're gonna tuck ourselves in.

36:03.622 --> 36:04.873
We're gonna fix what we can.

36:04.873 --> 36:07.876
Anything larger, we're gonna send
down for them to fix. Okay?

36:08.627 --> 36:10.462
- Okay.
- Yeah?

36:10.462 --> 36:11.547
Okay.

36:13.715 --> 36:15.676
- Jules!
- Yep?

36:16.218 --> 36:17.386
You give me the word.

36:30.274 --> 36:31.275
All right.

36:33.026 --> 36:33.902
Go ahead.

36:34.736 --> 36:37.990
<i>Closing hatch. Our 30 minutes start now.</i>

37:13.525 --> 37:14.818
Now!

37:33.253 --> 37:34.463
Stop! We're here.

37:35.964 --> 37:37.090
Okay!

37:39.801 --> 37:42.054
Shit. It's bad.

37:42.596 --> 37:43.597
Okay.

37:47.226 --> 37:49.895
Okay. This blade is the problem.
We're gonna send it down.

37:49.895 --> 37:52.773
We'll fix the rest up here.
Get the equipment up.

37:52.773 --> 37:54.900
Teddy, bring it up!

38:01.865 --> 38:03.534
Coop, I need you on the other side!

38:14.211 --> 38:16.004
Coop, I need you to check on that.

38:16.588 --> 38:17.965
Okay, guys. It's going up now!

38:26.265 --> 38:27.099
Come on.

38:35.107 --> 38:38.318
You know how I say doing things right
is better than doing them fast?

38:38.819 --> 38:39.820
Right now, I need both.

38:39.820 --> 38:41.196
Where the fuck is my tool?

38:45.325 --> 38:46.618
Come on.

38:48.579 --> 38:50.789
Okay, Coop. Grab the other end.

38:53.292 --> 38:54.793
- Okay, ready? Pull.
- Uh-huh.

38:55.627 --> 38:56.753
Pull.

38:57.296 --> 38:58.797
Yep. Got it.

39:00.549 --> 39:03.260
Send it down.
I need to fix the smaller blades.

39:16.106 --> 39:17.357
We're ready!

39:21.278 --> 39:23.113
- Hey! You got it?
- Uh-huh.

39:23.697 --> 39:25.157
- I'm not sure--
- Yeah?

39:25.157 --> 39:26.533
Look out!

39:27.618 --> 39:29.828
- Look out! Heads up!
- Oh, my God. No!

39:31.997 --> 39:33.999
- You guys okay?
- Yeah!

39:33.999 --> 39:37.211
Then pick the damn thing up and get it
straight so Jules can get it back in.

39:37.211 --> 39:41.632
Hey, Cooper! Cooper, focus!
I need you on the bolts. Come on. Now!

39:41.632 --> 39:45.511
Go! Let's do it! Come on, boys.

39:47.471 --> 39:48.680
Okay, Cooper!

39:54.478 --> 39:56.271
Temperature holding.

40:04.446 --> 40:05.614
Daddy!

40:07.699 --> 40:08.784
Daddy!

40:09.952 --> 40:11.161
Daddy!

40:13.664 --> 40:14.957
It's okay, Son.

40:17.125 --> 40:18.544
It's too dark.

40:18.544 --> 40:19.711
It's okay.

40:20.796 --> 40:22.172
Don't worry.

40:22.172 --> 40:25.467
The dark's nothing to be afraid of, okay?

40:25.467 --> 40:28.095
Daddy's gonna stay here with you
till you fall asleep.

40:36.728 --> 40:38.814
<i>This is LaFontaine on 80.</i>

40:38.814 --> 40:40.566
<i>All quiet up to the farms.</i>

40:41.275 --> 40:42.317
Copy that.

40:53.370 --> 40:54.538
I can't sleep.

40:58.500 --> 40:59.501
Then don't.

41:13.223 --> 41:16.894
Ten thousand people
aren't sleeping right now,

41:18.395 --> 41:20.272
terrified the power won't come back.

41:22.608 --> 41:26.320
Afraid maybe the groundwater will rise,
and they'll drown.

41:27.070 --> 41:31.909
Or maybe a bunch of nutjobs will bust out
through the top and let the poison in.

41:33.410 --> 41:37.998
We've always been
one catastrophic failure away

41:37.998 --> 41:39.291
from the end of it all,

41:40.417 --> 41:42.503
and this just makes everyone
conscious of it.

41:43.837 --> 41:45.380
Maybe that's not a bad thing.

41:46.924 --> 41:48.967
Makes you appreciate the day you have.

41:50.844 --> 41:53.514
I know you think
appointing Nichols is a mistake,

41:53.514 --> 41:57.559
but something about her makes me hopeful.

41:58.310 --> 42:02.356
Hopeful enough, I might be able
to hand the reins over to someone else.

42:03.065 --> 42:04.107
You'd consider retiring?

42:05.901 --> 42:07.486
To do what? Sit around and knit?

42:08.529 --> 42:09.571
Why not?

42:10.405 --> 42:13.242
Maybe open a shop

42:14.618 --> 42:17.162
right next to some guy who does drawings.

42:23.961 --> 42:26.797
You know I didn't come all this way
just to meet Nichols.

42:26.797 --> 42:29.258
I wanted to spend time with you.

42:36.849 --> 42:38.559
I know it's why I came.

43:02.833 --> 43:06.086
Fuck! Boss!

43:06.795 --> 43:08.463
It's overheating
way faster than we thought.

43:08.463 --> 43:09.882
How much time?

43:10.841 --> 43:12.176
A few minutes, maybe?

43:18.307 --> 43:20.267
Jules, you gotta get out!

43:20.267 --> 43:22.853
We only got a few minutes! Jules!

43:23.770 --> 43:25.189
What? What did he say?

43:25.189 --> 43:27.399
- We only have a few minutes.
- What? No.

43:27.399 --> 43:28.984
No, Knox. We need more time!

43:28.984 --> 43:30.611
- We're redlining!
- Already?

43:30.611 --> 43:33.488
The temperature's higher than we expected!
I gotta open the valve!

43:33.488 --> 43:37.075
No! Not without the rotor blade! Fuck.

43:38.327 --> 43:40.704
Teddy!

43:41.747 --> 43:43.749
- We're trying!
- Try harder!

43:47.503 --> 43:49.129
- How's it looking?
- It's getting worse.

43:49.588 --> 43:50.589
Fuck.

43:51.882 --> 43:52.883
Fuck.

43:57.971 --> 43:59.181
What do we do?

43:59.890 --> 44:01.308
Okay. Take over.

44:01.308 --> 44:02.768
Keep working, okay?

44:02.768 --> 44:04.686
- It's just like I taught you, okay?
- All right.

44:04.686 --> 44:07.606
When the blade comes up,
you get it in there, you bolt it in place.

44:07.606 --> 44:09.775
Make sure to get the angle right
or we're screwed.

44:09.775 --> 44:12.694
- But I can't do this with--
- No. Look at me.

44:12.694 --> 44:15.113
You're ready. You can do it, okay?

44:17.574 --> 44:18.575
Okay.

44:25.165 --> 44:26.041
Teddy!

44:27.167 --> 44:28.794
- Another minute!
- He needs it now!

44:28.794 --> 44:30.462
- Get it up there!
- I'm trying!

44:30.462 --> 44:33.715
- Jules, where are you going?
- Gonna try and buy us more time!

44:39.221 --> 44:40.305
Shit!

44:47.062 --> 44:49.439
I got it in here. You go make sure
she doesn't do anything stupid.

45:03.495 --> 45:04.538
Jules? What are you doing?

45:04.538 --> 45:06.164
It's the only way to cool it down.

45:07.249 --> 45:09.001
When I yell, turn it on.

45:09.001 --> 45:10.127
You're going in there?

45:13.422 --> 45:14.423
Fuck.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.061
Now! Turn it on!

45:46.246 --> 45:49.666
We're cooling down.
Fuck yes, Jules! It's working.

45:50.542 --> 45:54.713
Okay. You crazy bitch.

46:24.243 --> 46:25.911
Stay inside, please, sir.

46:27.996 --> 46:28.997
Thank you.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.803
Help! Somebody, help!

46:43.971 --> 46:46.265
Help!

46:46.849 --> 46:49.434
Somebody, help! Help!

46:50.769 --> 46:53.063
I was trying to get home,
and the lights went out.

46:53.063 --> 46:57.359
It's okay, sir. We got you now. Here.
Beson'll get you back safe.

46:58.360 --> 46:59.194
Thanks.

47:19.673 --> 47:21.258
Teddy, the blade!

47:21.258 --> 47:22.384
Another minute!

47:26.471 --> 47:28.307
Shit.

47:28.307 --> 47:30.100
Come on. Come on, Jules.

47:30.100 --> 47:31.768
Just give me a few more minutes. Come on.

47:37.608 --> 47:39.109
Come on!

47:43.322 --> 47:45.240
Boss! Knox!

47:45.240 --> 47:47.034
Teddy, hurry the fuck up!

47:47.034 --> 47:48.660
Nearly there!

47:55.792 --> 47:56.627
Fuck.

47:57.211 --> 47:58.128
Coming in.

48:01.423 --> 48:03.967
Faster! We're redlining again!

48:03.967 --> 48:05.052
Get it up!

48:12.267 --> 48:13.477
Come on!

48:16.063 --> 48:18.982
Jules! The blade's goin' up to Coop!

48:34.248 --> 48:35.832
Stop! I got it!

48:49.972 --> 48:50.973
Come on!

48:53.475 --> 48:54.685
Hurry!

48:56.520 --> 48:57.354
Knox!

49:04.069 --> 49:05.070
Fuck.

49:07.239 --> 49:10.033
Cooper!
Get that blade on! It's gonna blow!

49:14.204 --> 49:17.499
Come on, Coop! You gotta get it up there!

49:21.378 --> 49:24.381
Shirley! Come on!

49:27.509 --> 49:29.428
Fuck! She's still in there!

49:29.428 --> 49:31.805
We need to get her out! Fuck!

49:32.598 --> 49:33.640
Fuck!

49:43.525 --> 49:44.526
Come on!

49:51.283 --> 49:52.451
Come on!

49:55.621 --> 49:58.373
Come on! Help!

50:00.167 --> 50:02.503
Come on, Jules.
Just give me a few more seconds.

50:13.263 --> 50:14.264
Fuck.

50:15.891 --> 50:18.685
Cooper! Get the fuck out now!

50:18.685 --> 50:20.312
I'm almost there!

50:20.312 --> 50:21.939
Get her out! We need to get her out!

50:21.939 --> 50:24.024
Boss, she's drowning!

50:28.779 --> 50:29.821
Come on.

50:35.035 --> 50:36.203
Done!

50:36.203 --> 50:38.914
Get him down! Get Jules out now!

50:46.171 --> 50:47.548
- Come on!
- Fuck.

50:48.382 --> 50:50.092
Go! Get her out!

50:50.092 --> 50:51.969
Grab it! Pull!

50:56.807 --> 50:58.517
- Jules?
- Come on!

51:02.604 --> 51:03.605
Come on!

51:08.235 --> 51:09.236
Fuck.

51:26.295 --> 51:28.505
She's out! Chamber is clear!

52:08.170 --> 52:10.172
- Did they get it done?
- Yeah, maybe-- I think so.

52:24.269 --> 52:25.854
Come on.

52:36.198 --> 52:39.493
Fuck. Fuck.

53:56.028 --> 54:00.199
Hope you're not expecting me
to praise you for doing your job.

54:00.199 --> 54:02.117
I came to say I'm sorry for what I said.

54:04.745 --> 54:08.290
You weren't wrong.
I haven't left this place in a long time.

54:08.290 --> 54:11.418
Yeah, but I failed,
and I took it out on you.

54:12.503 --> 54:13.504
How did you fail?

54:13.504 --> 54:16.173
I tried to do what George wanted me to,
and I couldn't.

54:19.510 --> 54:21.970
You know, when I first
heard about you and the computer guy,

54:21.970 --> 54:24.473
I didn't know what to think.

54:25.265 --> 54:27.601
And then Shirley told me
he made you smile.

54:33.232 --> 54:34.233
Yeah.

54:35.859 --> 54:37.402
I'm sorry you didn't get to meet him.

54:38.862 --> 54:40.113
He didn't tell you?

54:41.073 --> 54:43.200
No, it's all right. I told him not to.

54:43.200 --> 54:46.537
I sent for him. I said I had a problem
with my computer,

54:46.537 --> 54:48.455
which I didn't 'cause I built it.

54:49.498 --> 54:53.126
When he got here, I told him if he did
anything to hurt you,

54:53.752 --> 54:55.587
he would vanish without a trace.

55:00.175 --> 55:01.176
You--

55:07.975 --> 55:08.809
Before I go--

55:08.809 --> 55:12.062
To take up a job you're
clearly unqualified to do.

55:12.062 --> 55:15.148
Wow. I've always enjoyed
your words of encouragement.

55:20.863 --> 55:22.072
What is that?

55:22.614 --> 55:24.491
I don't know.
I found it with George's stuff.

55:25.617 --> 55:27.327
You brought a relic into my workshop?

55:27.327 --> 55:29.371
You love finding out how things work.

55:29.872 --> 55:31.248
I also like not dying.

55:31.248 --> 55:32.749
They wouldn't send you out to clean.

55:32.749 --> 55:35.294
The only way you'll get out of this place
is feet first.

55:36.587 --> 55:37.880
Thanks.

55:39.423 --> 55:42.050
Anyway, if you get a minute,
can you try and figure out what it is?

55:42.634 --> 55:43.677
Sure.

55:46.263 --> 55:47.264
Thanks.

55:50.934 --> 55:51.935
Yeah.

56:01.111 --> 56:02.237
Okay.

56:06.450 --> 56:07.451
Thanks...

56:11.663 --> 56:12.664
for everything.

56:17.586 --> 56:18.629
I'll send messages.

56:19.630 --> 56:21.840
Sheriff gets a radio. I'll be listening.

56:21.840 --> 56:23.217
Yeah, of course you will.

56:24.551 --> 56:25.552
One more thing.

56:29.515 --> 56:31.099
Don't end up like George.

56:52.704 --> 56:53.705
Could I get some water?

56:53.705 --> 56:54.790
Yes.

57:03.173 --> 57:04.341
Mayor Jahns,

57:05.884 --> 57:08.637
please tell me why this Silo
spent last night in the dark.

57:09.221 --> 57:11.974
- Because it was night.
- That's helpful, Deputy. Thank you.

57:11.974 --> 57:15.811
It was crucial we fix the generator.
I made the call.

57:15.811 --> 57:19.147
You made a deal with Juliette Nichols,
our soon-to-be sheriff?

57:20.190 --> 57:21.650
How did you hear that, Bernard?

57:21.650 --> 57:25.195
She's a thief from Mechanical.

57:25.195 --> 57:26.613
She'll be great.

57:26.613 --> 57:28.490
Ten thousand lives, Ruth.

57:30.117 --> 57:32.160
And all the generations that follow that.

57:32.911 --> 57:34.621
I pray to the Founders you're right.

57:48.010 --> 57:52.973
It's strange. I haven't left Mechanical
since I got here.

57:53.640 --> 57:57.227
It is time. There's some stuff
you gotta face up there.

57:59.730 --> 58:00.564
Yeah.

58:00.564 --> 58:03.567
And when you get sick of the up-toppers,
get your ass back down here.

58:03.567 --> 58:06.361
We'll be waiting for a visit
from our sheriff.

58:08.363 --> 58:09.364
Come on.

58:12.492 --> 58:13.619
You're gonna be great.

58:14.620 --> 58:16.330
Yeah. Okay.

58:18.332 --> 58:19.166
Go.

58:33.388 --> 58:35.265
<i>What about finding out the truth?</i>

58:35.974 --> 58:39.811
When I find something, I'll send word.

58:39.811 --> 58:40.729
A signal.

58:41.980 --> 58:43.023
<i>I promise.</i>

59:19.768 --> 59:22.020
I hope you're not making
a horrible mistake.

59:23.146 --> 59:24.147
I'm not.

59:25.566 --> 59:29.528
- Are you all right? Yeah?
- I'm fine.

59:30.279 --> 59:31.280
You sure?

59:39.288 --> 59:42.875
Why don't you grab a bottle of wine
and take me back to my apartment?

59:42.875 --> 59:43.959
Yes, ma'am.

59:45.252 --> 59:47.045
I just have to go to the restroom.

59:59.099 --> 01:00:01.351
- Which one?
- Whatever you want.

01:00:06.648 --> 01:00:11.069
Hey, Ruth, you think one bottle's enough?

01:00:14.114 --> 01:00:15.699
Maybe I get two, huh?

01:00:17.159 --> 01:00:18.202
We--

01:00:18.827 --> 01:00:19.828
Ruth.

01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:21.580
Ruth?

01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:26.168
Ruth!

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:33.133
Ruth.

01:00:33.634 --> 01:00:34.635
Ruth.

01:00:35.219 --> 01:00:36.553
Ruth!

01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:47.773
Ruth!

01:00:49.358 --> 01:00:50.359
Ruth.

01:00:50.901 --> 01:00:51.902
What happened?

01:00:53.654 --> 01:00:55.906
Ruth. Oh, no.

01:00:56.406 --> 01:00:57.574
Help!

01:00:57.574 --> 01:00:59.076
Somebody, please!

01:00:59.076 --> 01:01:01.370
Somebody!
