35:04.764 --> 35:07.083
Oh, my gosh, it is.

35:11.313 --> 35:14.530
- Thanks a lot, Grace.
- Wait...

35:14.557 --> 35:16.831
Hey Grace. Keep rotating these around.

35:16.858 --> 35:19.379
Oh, and tell Noah to come
back as soon as he's empty.

35:19.406 --> 35:21.748
(hushed): Yeah.

35:25.434 --> 35:27.976
- Ah, no thanks.
- No thank you.

35:28.003 --> 35:30.490
So, did, uh, you help out with all this?

35:30.517 --> 35:32.514
Oh, I tossed in a few spices,

35:32.541 --> 35:34.516
but Stephanie did most of the work.

35:34.543 --> 35:36.731
Oh, well, I'm glad you got to
be a part of it before you left.

35:36.758 --> 35:39.566
- What time's your flight?
- It's in a couple of hours.

35:39.593 --> 35:43.004
I actually... I have a cab
coming in a few minutes.

35:43.031 --> 35:47.223
Oh. Well, um, I wanted to give
you something before you leave.

35:47.450 --> 35:49.599
Cassie took me to this
bookstore in Chicago

35:49.626 --> 35:51.678
and it had a whole shelf
of old medical books.

35:51.705 --> 35:53.635
Sam, I'm not looking

35:53.662 --> 35:56.633
for more medical options that
probably aren't going to help.

35:56.775 --> 35:59.419
And right next to
those books, I found this.

35:59.446 --> 36:02.990
- (nice magical music)
- Walden.

36:03.017 --> 36:05.807
By Henry David Thoreau.

36:06.159 --> 36:07.595
I remembered how much you liked it

36:07.622 --> 36:09.462
when you read it in high school.

36:10.413 --> 36:12.799
It's my favorite book.

36:13.749 --> 36:17.888
It's about... letting
life just... happen.

36:19.965 --> 36:21.475
I hope you still like it.

36:21.502 --> 36:24.993
Hm! Thank you, Sam.

36:25.220 --> 36:27.436
You just let me know...

36:27.463 --> 36:29.699
if there's anything you want me to do.

36:29.849 --> 36:31.701
I will.

36:32.852 --> 36:34.821
And let me know when
you're gonna come back.

36:34.848 --> 36:38.307
I am going to be back, for sure.

36:43.488 --> 36:45.247
Thank you.

36:45.757 --> 36:47.284
Bye.

36:50.519 --> 36:52.854
- Ah, hi.
- Hey.

36:54.082 --> 36:55.692
Martha,

36:55.803 --> 36:57.611
there's a guy outside
with a horse and carriage

36:57.638 --> 37:00.448
who said you hired him for a ride
from here to Henderson's Mill.

37:00.475 --> 37:02.883
Oh, my goodness, I completely
forgot to cancel that!

37:02.910 --> 37:05.952
- What should I tell him to do?
- I don't know, just gallop on

37:05.979 --> 37:07.888
home, I suppose! (and then loudly):

37:07.915 --> 37:12.040
Unless there's anyone here who
would like to take a free ride!

37:13.378 --> 37:14.162
How would you feel

37:14.189 --> 37:15.918
about taking a trip
through town with me?

37:15.945 --> 37:17.832
It would be a shame to let
a good horse and carriage

37:17.859 --> 37:19.734
- go to waste...
- We call dibs!

37:19.761 --> 37:22.937
(Tom laughs gently.) It's all yours.

37:22.964 --> 37:26.222
(gentle romantic music)

37:31.561 --> 37:34.897
(barely audible conversation)

37:38.633 --> 37:40.722
And I... think this is our stop.

37:40.749 --> 37:43.746
- Yeah, looks like it.
- You want to take

37:43.773 --> 37:45.792
a look around? I hear
this place is pretty romantic.

37:45.819 --> 37:47.662
Ooh, we should probably find out.

37:47.689 --> 37:50.312
- We really should.
- (little chuckle)

37:52.682 --> 37:54.535
- M'lady.
- Thank you.

37:54.562 --> 37:56.194
Mm-hm.

37:58.987 --> 38:01.991
- Thanks.
- ♪ I had my name ♪

38:03.693 --> 38:06.402
- That was a nice wedding.
- It was.

38:06.429 --> 38:08.548
Where did you find that reading, anyway?

38:08.575 --> 38:11.151
Oh, it was just in a book
on a shelf somewhere.

38:11.178 --> 38:14.104
- Ha! Just on a shelf somewhere.
- Uh-huh.

38:15.670 --> 38:18.693
I wonder how many futures
began in a place just like this.

38:18.720 --> 38:23.011
Hm, yeah, There were probably
a lot of very special moments.

38:23.588 --> 38:25.566
I guess all it takes is
for two people to decide,

38:25.593 --> 38:29.102
"I want to be with you tomorrow,
and the day after that..."

38:29.129 --> 38:32.988
And then, suddenly, they're
living a lifetime together.

38:33.181 --> 38:35.441
Maybe it is that simple.

38:36.267 --> 38:38.394
Yeah. Sometimes it is.

38:39.854 --> 38:42.164
What if you and I
decided to do the same thing?

38:42.565 --> 38:44.885
Well, as long as
we're together tomorrow,

38:44.912 --> 38:47.076
then, that is perfect for me.

38:47.103 --> 38:49.744
Except I'm talking about
the tomorrow after that

38:49.771 --> 38:51.859
and all the rest of them.
What if we just decided

38:51.886 --> 38:54.335
that's how things are going to be?

38:57.038 --> 38:59.326
I mean forever, Cassie.

38:59.353 --> 39:03.052
I mean... for the rest of our lives.

39:03.461 --> 39:07.348
Well, I wouldn't say no,
if that's what you're asking.

39:11.136 --> 39:13.830
Is that what you're asking, Sam?

39:17.532 --> 39:20.194
Oh, Sam...

39:23.606 --> 39:25.508
Will you marry me?

39:26.025 --> 39:27.215
Yes.

39:27.242 --> 39:30.530
Yeah, of course I will. Ah...

39:30.673 --> 39:34.167
- I love you.

So... (sigh) ...that was a night.

40:01.186 --> 40:03.975
One of my favorites in a long time.

40:04.482 --> 40:07.048
Well, you know, we need
to tell Nick and Grace.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.525
Yeah...

40:09.552 --> 40:11.606
I guess our kids should
be the first to know

40:11.633 --> 40:13.823
that their parents are going to be...

40:14.073 --> 40:15.510
their parents.

40:15.537 --> 40:17.733
(soft chuckles)

40:17.760 --> 40:21.015

- Well... here we go.

40:21.042 --> 40:23.605
♪ Keep you in ♪

40:23.632 --> 40:25.285
How could you just
say that knowing Courtney

40:25.312 --> 40:27.588
- was standing right there?
- I wouldn't have said anything,

40:27.615 --> 40:30.179
Nick, if you would have said
something in the first place.

40:30.206 --> 40:31.718
You mean if I had done things your way,

40:31.745 --> 40:34.060
because of how you
always know what's best.

40:34.087 --> 40:37.465
- I didn't say that.
- Except you think it all the time!

40:38.026 --> 40:40.448
Hey. What's going on?

40:41.100 --> 40:42.841
Ask Nick.

40:42.985 --> 40:45.539
Yeah, that way I don't have to be in
the same room as him anymore.

40:45.566 --> 40:47.557
Which is perfectly fine with me.

40:47.690 --> 40:51.394
- Great.
- Grace...

40:52.278 --> 40:53.168
Hm...

40:53.195 --> 40:55.070
So, I guess...

40:55.097 --> 40:57.184
negotiating the rules
of this engagement might be

40:57.211 --> 41:01.002
- harder than we thought.
- Does that give you second thoughts?

41:01.788 --> 41:03.905
No second thoughts at all.

41:04.332 --> 41:05.908
Me neither.

41:06.042 --> 41:07.628
Well, then I guess we should put a ring

41:07.655 --> 41:09.839
on that finger so everybody
knows it's for real.

41:10.605 --> 41:11.645
Well then, I'll keep

41:11.693 --> 41:13.943
this space open... just for you.
