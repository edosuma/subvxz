02:42.420 --> 02:45.218
The Defense Department of the
United States government...

02:45.323 --> 02:47.553
has arrived at estimates
of casualties...

02:47.658 --> 02:50.422
should they and the Soviet Union
adopt a counterforce strategy...

02:50.528 --> 02:52.155
in the event of nuclear war.

02:53.497 --> 02:55.328
The estimates are as follows.

02:55.433 --> 02:58.163
100,000,000 dead
in the United States...

02:58.269 --> 03:00.760
115,000,000
dead in Europe...

03:00.871 --> 03:04.398
including 23,000,000 dead
in Great Britain.

03:04.508 --> 03:07.409
Without any civil defense,
the counterforce strategy...

03:07.511 --> 03:10.912
has the capacity to destroy
all life in Western Europe...

03:11.015 --> 03:14.144
the United States and
the Soviet Union.

03:14.252 --> 03:15.718
With an effective...

03:15.820 --> 03:17.811
I want to talk to you
about the girls.

03:18.856 --> 03:21.552
All right.
What about them?

03:23.861 --> 03:26.421
I think Rosa's a bad influence.

03:29.467 --> 03:30.934
Meaning what, exactly?

03:31.035 --> 03:33.834
Anoushka worries about her.

03:33.939 --> 03:35.600
She says she's disturbed.

03:35.707 --> 03:39.107
So would you be if you'd been told you
were a failure when you were 11 years old.

03:39.210 --> 03:43.203
- Yeah. Bloody 11-plus exams.
- You did well though.

03:43.314 --> 03:45.373
Not that exams mean anything
of reaI significance.

03:45.483 --> 03:46.950
Can't measure intelligence.

03:47.051 --> 03:48.643
Anyway,
she's not disturbed.

03:48.753 --> 03:50.220
She's interesting.

03:50.321 --> 03:52.312
And she's my best friend.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.307
Close your eyes.

04:20.918 --> 04:22.579
Turn your head.
Opposite way.

05:06.130 --> 05:07.757
You're not doing it right.

05:08.899 --> 05:10.366
Try again.

06:10.095 --> 06:11.959
Where the hell
have you been?

06:13.030 --> 06:16.261
We were just, you know,
roving about.

06:19.004 --> 06:21.438
- Being free.
- It's 2:00 in the morning.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.303
Roland, please.
Say something.

06:27.813 --> 06:30.782
Well, yes, it is late.

06:30.882 --> 06:32.873
You always stay up late.

06:34.151 --> 06:35.118
True.

06:39.057 --> 06:41.525
Anoushka must be
crazed with worry.

06:42.961 --> 06:44.428
Doubtful.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.156
Rosa.

06:51.169 --> 06:54.605
Okay, come on. I suppose I'd
better drive you home, Rosa.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.573
Jesus.
I should be working.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.795
Tomorrow?

07:57.903 --> 08:00.304
- Today, actually.
- Good point.

08:01.073 --> 08:02.539
Bye, Ginger's dad.

08:03.141 --> 08:04.802
It's Roland...

08:04.910 --> 08:06.377
actually.

08:13.618 --> 08:18.180
It says here that a girl's most important
possession is a bubbly personality.

08:19.025 --> 08:20.492
Interesting.

08:21.560 --> 08:25.051
Do you think Simone de Beauvoir
has a bubbly personality?

08:25.163 --> 08:27.529
- Who?
- That French writer.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.758
She's an existentialist.

08:30.702 --> 08:32.897
Maybe she hasn't read Girl.

08:33.004 --> 08:35.666
It says here that boys don't like girls
who are too serious.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.648
Well, even so...

08:42.748 --> 08:45.046
did I tell you I've
decided to be a poet?

08:45.952 --> 08:47.543
Thought you were already.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.517
Do you think they've
shrunk enough yet?

09:01.067 --> 09:02.364
Sorry.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.855
- I've been thinking.
- Unusual.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.723
Very funny.
Listen.

10:02.828 --> 10:04.693
I'm listening.

10:04.797 --> 10:07.630
I'd prefer the world not to end.
Wouldn't you?

10:08.401 --> 10:09.868
Probably...

10:11.137 --> 10:12.764
if I find true love.

10:16.307 --> 10:17.774
You know?

10:19.611 --> 10:21.307
The kind that lasts forever.

10:23.616 --> 10:26.016
If there is a forever.

10:26.118 --> 10:27.585
Good point.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.487
But really, Rosa...

10:33.592 --> 10:35.389
I think we should
do something...

10:35.494 --> 10:37.120
about the bomb.

10:38.029 --> 10:39.690
You know, protest.

10:41.332 --> 10:42.960
I think we should pray.

10:51.410 --> 10:52.377
Gosh.

10:54.146 --> 10:55.613
Thank you.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.050
Rosa?

13:51.191 --> 13:52.658
Isn't that Mum's?

13:53.827 --> 13:55.123
So?

14:57.691 --> 15:00.626
- Where are you two going?
- To a meeting.

15:00.727 --> 15:02.250
What kind of meeting?

15:02.361 --> 15:04.454
A meeting to ban the bomb.

15:04.563 --> 15:06.794
It's called the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.198
YCND.

15:09.302 --> 15:10.769
What's the "Y" for?

15:10.870 --> 15:12.269
Young.

15:12.372 --> 15:15.034
Well, good for you two girls.

15:15.141 --> 15:17.302
That's marvelous.
Don't you think so, Nat?

15:17.410 --> 15:18.877
Roland would be pleased.

15:18.978 --> 15:20.809
Just don't get back
too late, Rosa.

15:20.914 --> 15:23.814
- You've got to help me with the little
ones. - I haven't got to do anything.

15:23.916 --> 15:25.850
God, if there was
a man around...

15:25.951 --> 15:27.783
- You'd be lucky.
- Rosa!

15:28.888 --> 15:30.355
Speaking of which...

15:30.457 --> 15:32.857
when was the last time
you did any washing up, Ginger?

15:32.959 --> 15:35.257
But I've hardly been
here for any meals.

15:35.362 --> 15:38.661
Well, exactly.
Where have you been?

15:38.765 --> 15:41.427
I had a letter from your school.
It was embarrassing.

15:41.534 --> 15:43.161
Embarrassing.

15:43.269 --> 15:45.293
How terrible.

15:45.404 --> 15:47.600
Especially given that the
world might blow up...

15:47.707 --> 15:50.232
which none of you
seem to understand.

15:50.343 --> 15:53.039
Are you quite sure
about that, darling?

15:53.146 --> 15:56.547
Oh, Mark, I didn't mean you.

15:59.119 --> 16:01.849
The question is what to do.

16:01.955 --> 16:03.946
Or, as Engels puts it,
"What is to be done?"

16:04.057 --> 16:08.460
Nuclear weapons
do not protect us.

16:08.561 --> 16:10.620
They threaten our
very existence.

16:11.765 --> 16:14.199
The missiles on bases
here in Britain...

16:14.300 --> 16:16.996
are hundreds of times
more powerful...

16:17.103 --> 16:19.298
than those used in Hiroshima.

16:19.406 --> 16:21.499
We have to take direct action.

16:22.275 --> 16:26.974
We must do everything we can
to stop this madness.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.674
The government can't ignore it if there
are enough people on the streets.

16:29.783 --> 16:31.250
So how do we get people out?

16:31.351 --> 16:35.014
How do we get people out of their
homes and marching with us?

16:35.121 --> 16:38.215
You back there.
Well, girls?

16:38.324 --> 16:40.121
Haven't seen you here before.

16:40.226 --> 16:41.693
What do you say?

16:42.395 --> 16:44.920
Do you think the politicians
will listen to us?

16:51.905 --> 16:53.031
In my...

16:53.139 --> 16:55.300
In my dream I heard
the warning.

16:56.876 --> 16:58.741
"You have three
minutes left," it said.

17:00.013 --> 17:01.878
"Go and tell the others.

17:04.317 --> 17:07.080
Tell the others now. "

17:07.186 --> 17:09.656
How could I not
suspect something?

17:09.757 --> 17:11.223
You're never here.

17:11.325 --> 17:12.883
I'm here now.

17:12.992 --> 17:16.018
- Tell me.
- For God's sake.

17:16.128 --> 17:18.494
"Tell the others now,
this morning. "

17:18.598 --> 17:20.589
Don't tell me what's enough.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.861
Oh, God, Natalie!

17:27.507 --> 17:30.306
Or... Or you...

17:30.411 --> 17:31.878
"Or you soon...

17:33.481 --> 17:36.677
will all be dead. "

17:38.384 --> 17:40.784
"Or you soon will all be dead. "

17:52.366 --> 17:53.594
Ta.

18:05.578 --> 18:07.910
What on earth is that crucifix
doing round your neck?

18:08.014 --> 18:10.245
Rosa and I went to church.

18:10.851 --> 18:13.251
- Church?
- Once.

18:13.354 --> 18:15.083
She wanted me to.

18:16.123 --> 18:18.421
You do realize that
God is an invention.

18:20.126 --> 18:21.593
Sort of.

18:21.694 --> 18:25.425
Every man needs to struggle
for his own authority, Ginger.

18:25.532 --> 18:27.329
For autonomous thought.

18:29.102 --> 18:31.333
Which is why you mustn't
listen to a word I say.

18:31.438 --> 18:33.133
Well, exactly.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.435
I autonomously decided
to go to church with Rosa...

18:35.543 --> 18:37.010
to see what it's like.

18:40.814 --> 18:43.976
- It's a bit kitsch.
- Rosa gave it to me.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.550
Did she now?

18:50.723 --> 18:52.191
What was it like?

18:53.827 --> 18:56.887
It was sort of exciting,
like going to the theater.

18:56.997 --> 18:58.487
Then we went to a meeting.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.868
- What kind of meeting?
- Ban the bomb.

19:03.803 --> 19:05.270
That's my girl.

19:06.005 --> 19:09.133
See, you're an activist,
not a supplicant.

19:09.809 --> 19:11.869
But don't you think...

19:11.979 --> 19:15.005
you know, people need
something to believe about...

19:15.115 --> 19:16.980
what happens when you die?

19:19.219 --> 19:23.713
The concept of life after
death is a superstition...

19:24.391 --> 19:28.349
designed to keep people happy with
their limited existence in the present.

19:28.461 --> 19:31.658
The only life is the
one we have now...

19:31.765 --> 19:34.563
which is why we must seize it...

19:34.668 --> 19:37.694
and live while we
have the chance.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.501
Good point.

20:11.037 --> 20:13.165
# Maybe

20:13.273 --> 20:18.575
# Tuesday will be

20:18.679 --> 20:24.413
# My good news day

20:28.822 --> 20:32.587
# We'll build a little home

20:34.395 --> 20:37.421
# Just meant for two

20:39.800 --> 20:43.236
# From which I'll never roam

20:44.705 --> 20:48.869
# Who would?
Would you? #

20:48.976 --> 20:50.443
Where's Roland?

20:51.245 --> 20:52.712
I don't know.

20:54.248 --> 20:56.580
I never seem to know
where he is anymore.

20:59.319 --> 21:01.344
Want a cup of tea, Mum?

21:02.856 --> 21:04.323
Thank you, darling.

22:20.168 --> 22:23.330
- Who's that with Roland?
- The jazz band?

22:23.437 --> 22:26.429
No, the girl.
Blonde one sitting next to him.

22:28.242 --> 22:30.005
A student or something.

22:43.591 --> 22:47.048
Mum's not too happy
about it at the moment.

23:13.821 --> 23:16.723
You could consider
eating it, Ginger.

23:22.730 --> 23:24.493
How's school, by the way?

23:25.733 --> 23:27.996
Or are you still not really bothering
with that at the moment?

23:29.236 --> 23:31.295
Is that why you
asked me round?

23:32.239 --> 23:34.036
Did Mum ask you to talk to me?

23:34.141 --> 23:36.132
Don't be silly.

23:36.243 --> 23:38.303
We always love seeing you.

23:38.413 --> 23:41.041
Anyway, I thought
you might like to meet Bella.

23:41.149 --> 23:43.117
- She's asked for dish soap.
- What?

23:43.718 --> 23:45.185
What's dish soap?

23:45.286 --> 23:48.949
It's American.
Washing-up liquid, Ginger.

23:49.057 --> 23:52.890
Bella washes her
hair with dish soap.

23:53.927 --> 23:56.157
It's because she's from
New York, you see.

23:56.263 --> 23:58.323
Don't listen to him.
That's got nothing to do with it?

23:58.433 --> 24:01.061
- I'm teasing. I'm teasing.
- Coming!

24:08.309 --> 24:12.039
There you are.
Good girl.

24:12.145 --> 24:14.841
So much nature,
right in the city.

24:14.948 --> 24:16.415
It's civilized.

24:17.585 --> 24:20.816
The English need their parks so that
they can get away from each other.

24:20.922 --> 24:24.517
It must be the strain
of being so nice.

24:24.626 --> 24:26.617
Even the ban-the-bomb
march was polite.

24:26.728 --> 24:29.526
- Were you there too?
- Of course we were.

24:29.631 --> 24:32.623
- I didn't see you.
- Well, so many people, darling.

24:33.902 --> 24:35.698
We were right up at the front.

24:35.802 --> 24:37.565
It was led by a vicar, Ginger.

24:37.672 --> 24:39.640
- A vicar!
- A canon, actually.

24:39.741 --> 24:41.402
No, a vicar with a cannon.

24:43.211 --> 24:44.940
Yes, Canon Collins.

24:45.046 --> 24:46.707
A worthy Christian.

24:46.814 --> 24:49.408
A good man, actually,
despite his beliefs.

24:53.755 --> 24:55.222
Oh, bravo!

24:56.456 --> 25:00.086
So I gather from
your two godfathers here...

25:00.194 --> 25:02.958
that you might be
a militant, like me.

25:04.065 --> 25:05.692
Good for you, Ginger.

25:41.102 --> 25:43.161
Can't you thank me?

25:43.271 --> 25:44.738
Even one word?

25:47.075 --> 25:49.168
I made you a pie.

25:50.745 --> 25:52.474
Your favorite.

25:53.614 --> 25:55.081
Yeah, I noticed.

25:56.117 --> 25:57.778
And?

25:58.519 --> 25:59.817
Thanks.

26:01.123 --> 26:02.589
Is that it?

26:02.690 --> 26:04.954
Is that all you
can say to me?

26:06.728 --> 26:10.596
Thank you very much indeed.
Is that what you want?

26:10.698 --> 26:13.633
What's wrong with
wanting my cooking to be noticed?

26:13.735 --> 26:15.202
Nothing.

26:15.303 --> 26:19.638
I don't believe...
this performance.

26:19.742 --> 26:22.575
It's just not you, Nat.
So why don't you come out with it?

26:22.678 --> 26:24.304
Come out with what?

26:24.412 --> 26:27.506
If you want to shame me
again with this display...

26:27.615 --> 26:29.412
- But I didn't say anything.
- But you meant it.

26:29.517 --> 26:32.748
And as I tell my students,
say what you mean.

26:33.588 --> 26:35.783
I'm not your student.

26:35.890 --> 26:38.290
I'm your wife.
Have you forgotten?

26:38.393 --> 26:40.828
The martyred wife
finally comes out with it.

26:40.929 --> 26:42.920
- With what?
- The accusation.

26:43.032 --> 26:44.556
Roland, I...

26:47.101 --> 26:49.797
- Why do you...
- Why do I what?

27:03.652 --> 27:06.780
Nat.
Nat.

27:08.456 --> 27:10.651
Why do you twist my words?

27:13.428 --> 27:16.625
You make everything seem
as if it's my fault.

27:17.832 --> 27:20.062
Why can't you just be normal?

27:20.168 --> 27:21.636
Normal?

27:23.872 --> 27:25.339
What the hell is normal?

27:26.875 --> 27:28.809
You know bloody
well what I mean.

27:28.911 --> 27:30.901
Natalie, please.

27:31.012 --> 27:32.377
Please.

27:35.516 --> 27:40.351
How can I enjoy eating in this
atmosphere of resentment?

27:40.455 --> 27:43.391
And how can I enjoy cooking
when you just gobble it up?

27:43.492 --> 27:46.893
Oh, for God's sake.
I've been working all day.

27:48.397 --> 27:50.092
But I made it for you.

27:50.199 --> 27:51.564
There's emotional
blackmail again.

27:53.134 --> 27:55.659
If the transitory nature of cooking
and eating offends you so much...

27:55.770 --> 27:58.898
then why don't you take up
your painting again...

27:59.006 --> 28:01.874
and make something
for posterity?

28:01.977 --> 28:03.444
And with what?

28:04.913 --> 28:08.371
I'm scraping to pay the bills,
with the money...

28:08.484 --> 28:10.850
Yes, with the money I earn.

28:10.953 --> 28:14.081
- But it's not enough for paint.
- Get a job!

28:14.189 --> 28:16.452
Why don't you sod off
to your bloody yacht?

28:16.557 --> 28:19.117
It's a boat.
It's a small boat.

28:19.227 --> 28:22.356
Your bloody boat with some
blonde student again...

28:22.464 --> 28:23.931
for all I know.

28:25.467 --> 28:27.799
Anyway, what kind
of job could I get?

28:44.386 --> 28:47.048
Roland's moving out.
They're separating.

28:47.156 --> 28:48.589
Again.

28:49.191 --> 28:51.022
Not that it'll make
any difference.

28:51.126 --> 28:53.026
He's hardly ever
at home anyway.

28:54.296 --> 28:56.025
At least you have a dad...

28:56.131 --> 28:57.962
who takes you out and stuff.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.496
I'm sure he wouldn't mind if
you came with me this weekend.

29:03.839 --> 29:06.637
You don't want me tagging along
with your beloved Dad.

29:07.376 --> 29:08.968
Don't be silly.

29:09.077 --> 29:12.274
But anyway,
I have a Roland, actually.

29:12.381 --> 29:14.542
- He won't let me call him Dad.
- I know.

29:14.650 --> 29:16.515
You told me.
Lots of times.

29:16.618 --> 29:18.085
Did I?

29:20.489 --> 29:22.422
Did I also tell you
he says the word "dad"...

29:22.523 --> 29:24.458
makes him think of
slippers by the fire...

29:24.560 --> 29:26.858
and other bourgeois
death traps?

29:26.962 --> 29:28.589
He has a point, of course.

29:30.599 --> 29:32.794
What's Natalie's view
on death traps?

29:32.901 --> 29:34.801
She just bursts into tears...

29:34.903 --> 29:37.463
as usual, when he
says stuff like that.

29:37.573 --> 29:39.040
Which he then says is...

29:39.141 --> 29:41.109
Emotional blackmail.

29:42.244 --> 29:43.541
Rosa!

29:43.645 --> 29:46.409
Rosa, can you bring
the girls up now?

29:47.749 --> 29:49.216
Hello.

29:50.352 --> 29:52.616
Our mothers are pathetic.

29:52.721 --> 29:54.382
They don't believe
in anything.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.487
Or do anything,
more to the point.

29:59.094 --> 30:00.652
Except moan about stuff.

30:00.762 --> 30:02.457
At least your mum has a job.

30:02.564 --> 30:04.556
Cleaning?
You call that a job?

30:04.667 --> 30:06.395
She hates it.
She moans on and on.

30:07.069 --> 30:08.832
Roland really hates
the moaning thing.

30:09.438 --> 30:11.235
It's no wonder.

30:12.774 --> 30:15.470
- No wonder what?
- It's no wonder they can't keep their men.

31:24.546 --> 31:26.606
What could be
better than this?

31:28.618 --> 31:30.483
Isn't she marvelous?

31:33.221 --> 31:34.916
Am I right, girls?

31:35.023 --> 31:36.217
It's lovely.

31:36.325 --> 31:37.952
It's so romantic.

31:38.060 --> 31:39.527
Indeed.

31:41.530 --> 31:44.829
There is a poetry in small spaces,
isn't there?

31:46.602 --> 31:49.002
Confinement can be
utterly beautiful...

31:49.972 --> 31:52.532
but only if it's a
matter of choice.

31:53.509 --> 31:54.975
What do you mean?

31:56.111 --> 31:58.045
Well, what I mean is...

31:58.980 --> 32:00.641
a prison cell,
on the contrary...

32:00.749 --> 32:03.149
is the ugliest expression
of minimalism.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.285
It must have been
really terrible.

32:08.991 --> 32:11.789
Ginger told me about it.

32:11.894 --> 32:13.384
Did she?

32:17.566 --> 32:19.534
We tell each other everything.

32:26.541 --> 32:28.339
I have nothing to hide.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.112
Prison was pretty brutal.

32:33.216 --> 32:35.116
First they strip you
of your clothes.

32:35.218 --> 32:37.846
And then,
if you dare to protest...

32:37.954 --> 32:40.353
they strip you of
all human contact.

32:40.455 --> 32:43.288
But the worst thing
about solitary confinement...

32:43.392 --> 32:47.557
is not that they make you feel
like an abandoned child...

32:47.663 --> 32:50.928
but that you start to
doubt your beliefs.

33:01.943 --> 33:03.240
I understand.

33:13.456 --> 33:15.515
The Soviet defense
minister said today...

33:15.625 --> 33:17.752
that their missiles could,
with one blow...

33:17.860 --> 33:19.327
wipe off the face of the earth...

33:19.429 --> 33:21.897
the industrial centers
of the United States.

33:21.998 --> 33:23.624
The British government
has announced...

33:23.732 --> 33:28.261
that nuclear missiles located on Royal
Air Force bases in the United Kingdom...

33:28.371 --> 33:32.831
are capable of the ultimate
retaliation against any Soviet attack..

33:32.942 --> 33:34.409
Did you hear that?

33:36.145 --> 33:38.909
- What?
- About the missiles.

33:52.462 --> 33:54.293
He always does that.

33:54.397 --> 33:56.262
Especially with Schubert.

34:58.094 --> 35:00.028
What do you think
I should say?

35:01.564 --> 35:03.031
Who to?

35:04.700 --> 35:06.292
Roland.

35:08.538 --> 35:10.166
Why are you writing to Roland?

35:11.375 --> 35:14.104
Well, I want to tell him
that I understand him.

35:15.578 --> 35:19.378
You know, like sometimes
in your soul...

35:21.117 --> 35:24.678
it's like you... you feel
someone else's pain.

35:26.889 --> 35:28.982
I can't decide whether
to start...

35:29.091 --> 35:31.458
with "Dear Roland"
or "Dearest Roland. "

35:33.597 --> 35:35.064
What do you think?

35:54.117 --> 35:56.517
# Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy

35:56.620 --> 35:58.086
# Tutti frutti

35:59.188 --> 36:03.784
# Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy
Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy

36:03.893 --> 36:06.446
# Tutti frutti, oh, Rudy

36:09.298 --> 36:11.995
# Got a gal named Sue

36:12.102 --> 36:14.263
# She knows just what to do #
- Fancy a drink?

36:14.371 --> 36:17.067
# I got a gal named Sue

36:17.174 --> 36:19.641
# She knows just what to do

36:19.742 --> 36:21.573
# She rock to the east
She rock to... #

36:25.548 --> 36:27.277
Oh, Ginger.

36:28.317 --> 36:29.614
You and Rosa.

36:29.719 --> 36:33.053
Oh, go away!
You don't understand.

36:36.226 --> 36:37.193
Ginger!

36:40.931 --> 36:42.898
You came to my school.

36:42.999 --> 36:44.466
I saw you.

36:46.969 --> 36:48.630
My teacher told
me you said...

36:48.738 --> 36:51.605
there should be more so-called
domestic science lessons.

36:51.708 --> 36:54.006
Is that what this is all about?

36:54.111 --> 36:56.306
How could you?

36:56.413 --> 36:59.143
You wanted me to learn
housework... at school.

36:59.249 --> 37:00.910
Listen, Ginger.

37:01.018 --> 37:03.316
When I had you,
I was a teenager.

37:04.620 --> 37:06.611
A teenager.

37:06.722 --> 37:09.953
I didn't know how to
boil a bloody egg.

37:10.059 --> 37:12.255
Roland never lifted a finger
to help with anything.

37:12.362 --> 37:14.830
- That's not my fault!
- Listen to me.

37:16.099 --> 37:19.796
I just don't want you
to struggle like I did.

37:19.903 --> 37:22.599
But I'm never going
to have any babies.

37:22.706 --> 37:24.435
Never.

37:24.541 --> 37:27.338
I don't want to be like you!
So bugger off!

37:29.178 --> 37:31.942
You and Rosa are
turning into little sluts.

37:33.383 --> 37:35.908
Anyway, I'm going to
go live with Roland.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.357
What are you
talking about?

38:29.206 --> 38:30.605
Hello.

38:30.707 --> 38:32.401
Is Roland in at all?

38:34.010 --> 38:35.477
Follow me.

38:47.624 --> 38:49.251
- Visitor, Roland.
- Thanks.

38:53.463 --> 38:54.930
What a surprise.

39:01.238 --> 39:02.705
Is everything all right?

39:04.141 --> 39:06.541
Yes.
Absolutely.

39:06.643 --> 39:09.942
Is Nat doing all right?
Not too many scenes or anything?

39:10.046 --> 39:11.513
Not too many.

39:12.115 --> 39:13.582
Good.

39:15.319 --> 39:16.945
I'll put the kettle on.

39:37.841 --> 39:39.536
Here, have a seat.

39:52.255 --> 39:53.745
The thing is...

39:56.861 --> 39:58.351
I was wondering...

40:00.997 --> 40:02.464
Yes?

40:06.102 --> 40:09.697
If, for example,
there was any room...

40:12.943 --> 40:16.607
I mean, I don't know.
It may not be feasible at all.

40:16.714 --> 40:19.342
- Room?
- Here.

40:24.955 --> 40:26.081
Well.

40:28.825 --> 40:30.292
Jesus, Ginger.

40:32.929 --> 40:34.419
It's a bit of...

40:36.100 --> 40:37.795
You, here?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.566
I suppose I could ask Roger.

40:49.679 --> 40:51.442
But look, you do realize,
of course...

40:51.548 --> 40:53.175
I'm working more
or less nonstop...

40:54.251 --> 40:56.743
and that this is a completely
unsuitable environment for you...

40:56.854 --> 40:58.515
in every possible respect?

41:00.391 --> 41:01.858
Absolutely.

41:25.816 --> 41:30.013
Are you quite sure that this move
is a wise idea, Ginger?

41:32.722 --> 41:36.158
How old were you when
you left home, Mark Two?

41:36.259 --> 41:38.490
Well, I was about your age.

41:38.596 --> 41:40.621
But I had to go.

41:40.731 --> 41:42.596
My mother was an
absolute monster.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.059
You see?

41:45.169 --> 41:46.761
Nat is not a monster.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.361
Not to you.

41:49.941 --> 41:51.669
Anyway, Mark...

41:51.775 --> 41:56.212
your mother was, in fact,
as I understand, not a monster...

41:56.313 --> 41:59.374
- but a gangster.
- Yes, yes.

42:02.987 --> 42:05.114
Was she a happy gangster?

42:07.425 --> 42:11.418
Oh, my darling,
darling Ginger.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.223
Nat is unhappy, darling...

42:13.330 --> 42:15.992
but it's not because of you.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.462
But was she always unhappy?

42:22.206 --> 42:25.539
- When she was my age.
You knew her then. - I did, yes.

42:25.643 --> 42:28.874
Did she cry all the time
before she had me?

42:28.980 --> 42:30.845
Well, she was troubled, darling.

42:30.948 --> 42:34.145
But then, we were all troubled.
It was wartime.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.241
Must have been an
absolute nightmare.

42:36.353 --> 42:39.846
You know, bombs falling
all the time, everywhere.

42:39.957 --> 42:42.755
I mean, nothing was secure.
Nothing.

42:42.860 --> 42:44.327
What's the difference?

42:45.396 --> 42:47.125
We could all die tomorrow.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.791
We could, Ginger.

42:49.900 --> 42:52.835
For sure.
We could.

42:52.937 --> 42:54.768
- Bella.
- Well, she's right.

42:54.872 --> 42:56.338
It is getting serious.

42:57.540 --> 43:00.101
But I don't want to die.

43:00.211 --> 43:02.179
I want to grow up
and do things.

43:02.279 --> 43:05.510
And you will, honey.
You will.

43:05.616 --> 43:07.140
My darling Ginger...

43:08.419 --> 43:11.445
can't you be a girl for
a moment or two longer?

43:12.990 --> 43:15.424
You'll be a woman soon enough.

43:22.299 --> 43:24.267
Roland replied to my letter.

43:25.336 --> 43:28.430
Did he?
What did he say?

43:30.041 --> 43:31.975
He said he was very touched.

43:33.577 --> 43:35.568
He has such deep feelings.

43:36.714 --> 43:39.707
- Such fierce feelings.
- I know.

43:40.818 --> 43:42.718
- And he's a pacifist.
- I know.

43:42.820 --> 43:45.084
Well, I think it's really noble.

43:45.189 --> 43:48.386
- It's eviI to kill.
- Well, exactly.

43:49.026 --> 43:50.653
It's one of the
Ten Commandments.

43:50.761 --> 43:54.162
Thou shalt not,
et cetera, et cetera.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.367
- You sound a bit cynical.
- Absolutely not.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.031
But I don't need a commandment
to work that one out.

44:03.674 --> 44:06.438
I think there are
times for action...

44:06.544 --> 44:08.341
to stop total death.

44:19.590 --> 44:21.218
Look, Rosa.

44:21.326 --> 44:24.954
I totally admire my
father in every way...

44:25.062 --> 44:26.620
but I'm just not sure...

44:27.665 --> 44:30.964
Is it really so noble to decide
not to fight someone like Hitler?

44:32.303 --> 44:35.101
- Mark says...
- You're always quoting Mark.

44:35.706 --> 44:37.799
And you're always
quoting Roland these days.

44:37.908 --> 44:40.138
Mark told me he chose
not to fight in the war...

44:40.244 --> 44:42.042
because he didn't
want to kill anybody.

44:42.147 --> 44:43.910
He was an ambulance
driver instead.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.573
But Roland was in prison...

44:45.684 --> 44:47.378
for being a conscientious
objector.

44:47.485 --> 44:49.214
I know.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.618
He's my father.

44:51.722 --> 44:54.748
And I'm going to go live with
him starting this week.

44:54.859 --> 44:57.327
And I'm going sailing
with him next weekend.

44:58.062 --> 45:00.121
Do you want to come?

45:00.231 --> 45:02.257
Actually, he thought
you should, probably.

45:03.034 --> 45:04.592
What do you mean, should?

45:38.669 --> 45:40.637
Best room in the house.

45:41.873 --> 45:43.932
Small, but...

45:44.042 --> 45:46.010
perfectly well-formed.

45:50.649 --> 45:52.207
Happy?

45:56.086 --> 45:57.553
I'll put the kettle on.

48:12.490 --> 48:15.118
"This is the way the world ends.

48:16.828 --> 48:18.796
This is the way the world ends"...

48:25.438 --> 48:27.428
"Not with a bang"...

48:28.740 --> 48:30.765
"Not with a bang"...

49:03.608 --> 49:07.443
Bella will not be parted from her work
in progress under any circumstances.

49:07.546 --> 49:10.845
Well, there are certain things
that one must hold on to.

49:10.950 --> 49:14.385
But don't you think occasionally
there's an argument for letting go, dear?

49:14.486 --> 49:17.922
Don't be fooled by such
phony modernity, Ginger.

49:18.022 --> 49:20.354
Letting go.
Please.

49:20.959 --> 49:23.894
But surely even a poetess...

49:23.995 --> 49:27.454
should be able to relax enough
to enjoy her soup...

49:27.566 --> 49:29.898
especially if it's been
made by Mark.

49:30.002 --> 49:32.664
But one is not a poetess,
Mark Two...

49:32.772 --> 49:36.138
just as one is not a "doctoress"
or a "physicistess. "

49:36.241 --> 49:37.708
Here we go.

49:37.809 --> 49:39.743
No, this is not a
matter of principle...

49:39.844 --> 49:42.312
but one of precise language.

49:42.414 --> 49:46.009
Names are word objects
and must be given due respect.

49:46.117 --> 49:49.383
Well, that's an interesting
concept, Bella.

49:49.488 --> 49:50.955
By the way, I am curious.

49:51.056 --> 49:54.321
I understand why you have
this adorable nickname... Ginger.

49:54.427 --> 49:57.691
But what's the name
on your birth certificate?

50:04.602 --> 50:06.797
My father named me...

50:09.275 --> 50:10.742
Africa.

50:10.843 --> 50:12.242
Africa!

50:12.344 --> 50:14.209
Any particular reason?

50:14.313 --> 50:17.941
He said it was in honor of Freud's theory
of the dark continent of woman.

50:18.049 --> 50:20.517
Oh, dear.
Freud.

50:20.618 --> 50:24.076
Is this the famous Roland who
holds us all in his theoretical spell?

50:35.534 --> 50:38.901
Well, let's just stick
with Ginger then, shall we?

50:39.004 --> 50:42.734
Although you could always
move on to Scarlet in due time.

50:42.841 --> 50:46.140
As in flame, not O'Hara.

50:46.244 --> 50:48.770
That's a good name
for an activist.

50:48.881 --> 50:50.439
How's all that going,
by the way?

50:51.884 --> 50:55.752
I'm thinking of joining
the Committee of 100, actually.

50:55.855 --> 50:57.482
I agree with Bertrand Russell.

50:57.590 --> 50:59.683
And what do you agree with?

51:00.659 --> 51:02.489
About direct action.

51:02.594 --> 51:06.428
He says the danger of nuclear war
is too great for lawful protest.

51:06.531 --> 51:08.796
So you think marching's not enough?

51:09.735 --> 51:11.828
It may not be enough
to save us...

51:12.838 --> 51:14.567
you know...

51:14.673 --> 51:17.005
from total extinction.

51:20.212 --> 51:22.373
Where are you going?

51:22.481 --> 51:23.947
To a restaurant.

51:25.016 --> 51:26.779
Where are you going?

51:28.319 --> 51:29.787
To a meeting.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.123
See you later then.

51:37.329 --> 51:39.024
So you're coming back here?

51:40.799 --> 51:42.460
Maybe.

51:48.439 --> 51:50.067
Do you want to try?

52:16.235 --> 52:18.135
This crisis is taking the world...

52:18.237 --> 52:20.137
to the brink of catastrophe.

52:20.239 --> 52:23.140
The Russians have put their
missiles on Cuba, as we know...

52:23.242 --> 52:25.142
as part of this deadly battle...

52:25.244 --> 52:27.144
with the United States
for world supremacy...

52:27.246 --> 52:29.372
that could end with
no world at all.

52:29.480 --> 52:32.473
And what is our government
doing about it?

52:32.585 --> 52:35.918
They tell people to put sandbags
over their windows and stay indoors.

52:36.021 --> 52:41.323
Meanwhile, the government have built
top secret bomb shelters underground.

52:41.427 --> 52:44.521
But only enough space
for themselves.

52:49.768 --> 52:53.169
Then who will be left for them to govern?
Everyone else will be dead.

52:53.272 --> 52:54.899
Burnt to cinders.

52:56.508 --> 52:58.305
I think it's immoral.

52:59.712 --> 53:02.010
You know,
to use precise language.

53:02.114 --> 53:04.708
Let me guess.
You shouldn't really be in here.

53:04.817 --> 53:06.444
You're still at school,
aren't you?

53:07.586 --> 53:09.110
Some of the time.

53:09.221 --> 53:11.622
Don't worry.
I'll buy you a drink.

53:12.892 --> 53:14.654
A pint and a half, please.

53:15.894 --> 53:18.124
Thanks.

53:18.230 --> 53:21.722
Anyway, I learn more at these
meetings than I ever do at school.

53:21.834 --> 53:23.802
That goes without saying, I think.

53:28.173 --> 53:29.640
Thanks.

53:35.281 --> 53:36.747
Thanks.

53:42.888 --> 53:45.322
Are you a student?

53:45.424 --> 53:46.948
I'm at art school.

53:47.993 --> 53:49.551
Do you draw?

53:49.662 --> 53:51.392
Yes, definitely.

53:52.565 --> 53:54.032
Sometimes.

53:56.770 --> 53:58.896
But I think I'm more
of a poet, actually.

53:59.004 --> 54:00.835
Are you?

54:02.541 --> 54:04.907
My mum used to be
a painter though.

54:05.010 --> 54:06.477
What's her name?

54:06.578 --> 54:08.239
You wouldn't know it.

54:08.347 --> 54:11.373
She gave it up,
you know, to have me.

54:15.789 --> 54:17.654
I live with my father
now anyway.

54:18.692 --> 54:20.852
He's a pacifist.

54:20.959 --> 54:22.927
He writes articles and stuff.

54:23.028 --> 54:24.791
Anything I might have read?

54:25.631 --> 54:27.394
"The Idea of Freedom. "

54:30.836 --> 54:32.327
He's your father?

55:50.582 --> 55:55.111
Ginger, want to try it?
Think it might be done.

56:20.046 --> 56:21.946
You sure you don't want any?

56:22.048 --> 56:25.108
No, I'm fine, thank you.
I've already eaten.

56:37.864 --> 56:39.729
- That's not bad.
- Who's the chef?

56:39.833 --> 56:42.393
We made it together...
me and Ginger.

56:42.502 --> 56:45.335
Mutual aid.
This is good.

56:45.438 --> 56:47.668
Communist cooks.
How marvelous.

56:50.343 --> 56:53.005
- Anarchists, I think.
- It's Italian, actually.

56:53.112 --> 56:54.578
Bolognese.

56:54.680 --> 56:57.582
Oh, there's lots of
anarchists in Bologna.

57:01.688 --> 57:03.155
You...

57:04.891 --> 57:07.189
are a thing of beauty, Rosa.

57:54.474 --> 57:55.999
Oh, Ginger.

58:22.268 --> 58:23.792
Ginger.

58:37.885 --> 58:40.285
- Look, Mum...
- How is everything?

58:41.221 --> 58:43.018
Can I stay the night tonight?

58:44.123 --> 58:46.455
I'm not moving back or anything.

58:50.029 --> 58:52.020
You're painting again.

58:52.131 --> 58:53.723
Yes, I am.

58:53.833 --> 58:55.801
And a bit of studying...

58:56.970 --> 58:58.438
now that...

58:58.539 --> 59:00.097
Well, that's good.

59:02.476 --> 59:04.103
But I could make up your bed.

59:18.625 --> 59:20.684
Aren't you happy
at Roland's...

59:20.794 --> 59:25.060
after going on and on about wanting to
live with him instead of boring old me?

59:26.567 --> 59:28.727
I never said that,
about being boring.

59:32.739 --> 59:34.707
But of course I'm
happy over there.

59:37.210 --> 59:38.838
It's really interesting.

59:40.814 --> 59:43.647
It was just a thought anyway.

59:43.751 --> 59:46.777
Don't bother with the bed or anything.
I was just passing.

01:00:04.438 --> 01:00:06.531
Made you some supper.

01:00:07.508 --> 01:00:08.998
What time is it?

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:12.044
About 2:00...

01:00:12.146 --> 01:00:13.772
or so.

01:00:15.014 --> 01:00:16.481
Somewhat late.

01:00:17.717 --> 01:00:19.185
But I cooked it.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.311
You said you were hungry.

01:00:22.423 --> 01:00:23.890
Well, I was.

01:00:23.991 --> 01:00:25.652
You're not going to eat it?

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.853
Oh, yes.

01:00:28.962 --> 01:00:30.452
Yes.

01:00:31.498 --> 01:00:33.227
Looks delicious.

01:00:34.268 --> 01:00:36.235
I didn't know you could cook.

01:00:36.969 --> 01:00:38.459
Nor did I.

01:00:49.283 --> 01:00:51.979
Look, I know it's all
got a bit complicated.

01:00:54.655 --> 01:00:57.851
Perhaps I can never be the
kind of father you really want.

01:00:59.626 --> 01:01:02.959
I'm not sure I'm
father material, really.

01:01:04.565 --> 01:01:06.362
Oh, but you are.

01:01:07.601 --> 01:01:10.069
I never said I wanted
anything different, did I?

01:01:10.704 --> 01:01:12.638
You've never complained
about anything, really.

01:01:12.739 --> 01:01:16.334
You're not a moaner,
as a rule, thank God.

01:01:19.011 --> 01:01:20.479
But look.

01:01:23.317 --> 01:01:27.048
Things have been difficult
for me with Nat...

01:01:27.154 --> 01:01:29.315
for a long time.

01:01:29.423 --> 01:01:31.948
One day you will
understand that...

01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:34.891
real love...

01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:36.826
when it comes...

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:42.699
is like a siren call.

01:01:45.672 --> 01:01:48.766
One simply has no choice...

01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:50.741
and one must surrender.

01:01:53.847 --> 01:01:55.314
But listen.

01:01:59.253 --> 01:02:00.949
I am aware...

01:02:01.756 --> 01:02:03.450
that...

01:02:03.557 --> 01:02:06.685
perhaps you might
not be entirely happy...

01:02:06.793 --> 01:02:08.260
with the situation.

01:02:10.164 --> 01:02:12.655
How could anyone be happy...

01:02:12.766 --> 01:02:15.234
when you know
about the bomb?

01:02:15.335 --> 01:02:17.701
Happiness is not
really an option...

01:02:19.673 --> 01:02:22.643
when you know the whole world
could be blown to pieces any minute.

01:02:23.545 --> 01:02:25.171
You are a good girl.

01:02:27.381 --> 01:02:29.246
You're a born radical...

01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:31.180
unsurprisingly.

01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:43.997
Listen.

01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:48.066
I think it's probably best if you
don't say anything to Nat...

01:02:48.168 --> 01:02:51.194
about the times with Rosa
on the boat, and so on.

01:02:54.408 --> 01:02:56.342
I'm sure we'd agree on this.

01:03:44.125 --> 01:03:46.559
...prematurely or unnecessarily...

01:03:46.661 --> 01:03:50.188
risk the cost of worldwide
nuclear war...

01:03:50.298 --> 01:03:54.131
in which even the fruits of victory
would be ashes in our mouth.

01:03:54.234 --> 01:03:56.759
But neither will we
shrink from that risk...

01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:59.395
at any time it must be faced.

01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:03.739
I have directed the armed forces
to prepare for any eventualities.

01:04:04.812 --> 01:04:07.144
It shall be the policy
of this nation...

01:04:07.248 --> 01:04:10.513
to regard any nuclear missile
launched from Cuba...

01:04:10.618 --> 01:04:13.416
against any nation in the
Western Hemisphere...

01:04:13.521 --> 01:04:17.718
as an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States...

01:04:17.824 --> 01:04:22.454
requiring a full retaliatory response
upon the Soviet Union.

01:04:23.464 --> 01:04:26.126
The cost of freedom
is always high...

01:04:26.234 --> 01:04:28.828
but Americans have
always paid it.

01:04:28.936 --> 01:04:31.427
And one path we
shall never choose...

01:04:31.539 --> 01:04:35.134
and that is the path
of surrender or submission.

01:04:42.516 --> 01:04:45.486
I dreamed there was
a wall of flame.

01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:51.057
I screamed because
I was to blame.

01:04:53.561 --> 01:04:55.392
I looked around.

01:04:58.733 --> 01:05:00.791
No night, no day...

01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:03.392
no sky, no ground.

01:05:03.503 --> 01:05:05.028
Nothing to say.

01:05:07.942 --> 01:05:09.603
Sorry I'm late.

01:05:09.711 --> 01:05:11.736
We were talking and talking.

01:05:11.846 --> 01:05:13.814
I didn't notice the time.

01:05:14.916 --> 01:05:17.214
- It was so...
- Intense.

01:05:18.619 --> 01:05:20.086
Right.

01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:25.759
Well, it was.

01:05:34.135 --> 01:05:35.602
And I think...

01:05:37.305 --> 01:05:38.932
I think Roland is wounded.

01:05:40.074 --> 01:05:42.508
What do you mean?
What's happened?

01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:44.600
Wounded emotionally, I mean.

01:05:44.711 --> 01:05:46.612
And spiritually.

01:05:46.714 --> 01:05:48.614
I think I can help him.

01:05:48.716 --> 01:05:51.810
Help him?
How can you help him?

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.319
- We have a lot in common, you know.
- Such as?

01:05:59.994 --> 01:06:03.122
Such as the fact that his mother
left him when he was little.

01:06:03.231 --> 01:06:05.461
You know,
like my father left me.

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:09.064
What a way to bond.

01:06:10.304 --> 01:06:11.794
Well, yes, actually.

01:06:11.906 --> 01:06:13.806
We understand each other.

01:06:13.908 --> 01:06:15.535
He confides in me.

01:06:31.058 --> 01:06:32.685
Anyway,
what are you writing?

01:06:33.294 --> 01:06:35.285
A poem...

01:06:35.396 --> 01:06:37.023
about the end of the world.

01:06:38.933 --> 01:06:41.094
Haven't you heard?

01:06:41.202 --> 01:06:43.864
- Heard what?
- About the crisis.

01:06:45.273 --> 01:06:47.435
Remember those
missiles in Cuba?

01:06:47.543 --> 01:06:48.908
What missiles?

01:06:49.011 --> 01:06:50.705
Where have you been?

01:06:51.979 --> 01:06:53.708
Don't you care about
the future anymore?

01:06:53.815 --> 01:06:56.579
Not everyone can save the
whole world like you, Ginger.

01:06:56.684 --> 01:06:59.346
Some of us have to concentrate
on just one person.

01:06:59.454 --> 01:07:02.548
- You can't save my dad.
- Why not?

01:07:05.593 --> 01:07:07.061
Who do you think you are?

01:07:07.162 --> 01:07:09.062
Who do you think you are?

01:07:09.164 --> 01:07:12.963
You can't stop a war if there's going
to be one. It's in the hands of God.

01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:16.564
That's convenient.

01:07:16.671 --> 01:07:18.798
Whose hands are you in then?

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.148
Just wait.

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:30.983
He'll dump you too
when you're older.

01:07:31.086 --> 01:07:32.553
No, he won't.

01:07:34.822 --> 01:07:37.154
He will.
He will.

01:07:39.927 --> 01:07:42.122
We didn't want to tell you.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.329
Didn't want to tell me what?

01:07:50.973 --> 01:07:52.565
What?

01:07:53.509 --> 01:07:55.408
What didn't you
want to tell me?

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:56.977
I think...

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.412
I'm pregnant.

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:45.448
There are persistent reports...

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:49.997
that the American government is about to
make a sensational move in the Cuba crisis.

01:08:50.098 --> 01:08:53.625
Lord Bertrand Russell,
in a statement released today said...

01:08:53.734 --> 01:08:55.202
"While life remains to us...

01:08:55.304 --> 01:08:57.966
we will not cease to do
what lies in our power...

01:08:58.073 --> 01:09:00.041
to avert the greatest calamity...

01:09:00.142 --> 01:09:02.371
that has ever
threatened mankind. "

01:09:04.444 --> 01:09:07.608
Ban the bomb!
Ban the bomb!

01:09:07.715 --> 01:09:10.207
Look out!
Police!

01:09:13.121 --> 01:09:15.589
Sit down!
Everybody sit down!

01:09:20.696 --> 01:09:22.162
Gate!

01:09:23.464 --> 01:09:26.796
Block the gate!
Everybody block the gate!

01:09:29.671 --> 01:09:31.229
Bella!

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.274
Ban the bomb!
Ban the bomb!

01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:34.774
Ginger!

01:09:35.477 --> 01:09:37.138
Yes, it's me.

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.148
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:09:41.249 --> 01:09:42.944
My God, you're shivering.

01:09:46.487 --> 01:09:49.251
Lean on me.
This could get rough. Okay?

01:09:49.357 --> 01:09:50.825
Hang on tight.

01:09:50.926 --> 01:09:53.554
Ban the bomb!
Ban the bomb!

01:09:53.662 --> 01:09:55.527
Ban the bomb!

01:09:55.631 --> 01:09:58.259
Move!

01:10:17.352 --> 01:10:18.944
Bella!

01:10:21.023 --> 01:10:22.991
Bella!

01:10:24.059 --> 01:10:26.027
Ginger!

01:10:37.372 --> 01:10:40.341
Ban the bomb!
Ban the bomb!

01:10:40.442 --> 01:10:44.936
Ban the bomb!
Ban the bomb! Ban the bomb!

01:11:21.516 --> 01:11:23.143
I am a doctor.

01:11:23.251 --> 01:11:25.219
You can speak freely to me.

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:30.620
Look, I can't help you
unless you talk.

01:11:30.726 --> 01:11:32.319
Do you understand?

01:11:33.730 --> 01:11:35.630
You seem depressed.

01:11:35.731 --> 01:11:37.392
Are you depressed?

01:11:39.935 --> 01:11:41.402
Then speak.

01:12:04.059 --> 01:12:05.526
Are you the girl's mother?

01:12:05.627 --> 01:12:07.094
No.

01:12:07.195 --> 01:12:08.822
No, I'm not.

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:12.161
- Where is the mother?
- She doesn't know her daughter is here.

01:12:12.267 --> 01:12:14.168
Then is one of you
the girl's father?

01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:17.171
We're family friends.
We've come to take her home.

01:12:17.273 --> 01:12:21.606
Well, she needs help.
All this protesting is a front, you know.

01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:23.974
The girl may be
seriously mentally ill.

01:12:24.079 --> 01:12:25.546
Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:12:27.015 --> 01:12:29.347
Maybe she's justifiably worried...

01:12:29.451 --> 01:12:31.851
about the possibility
of a nuclear holocaust.

01:12:33.289 --> 01:12:35.416
Have you considered that?

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.100
Just talk to us, darling.

01:12:51.873 --> 01:12:53.341
Come on.

01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:56.202
Did they hurt you?

01:12:57.046 --> 01:12:59.514
Ginger, you must tell us.

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:02.547
Please say something.

01:13:08.023 --> 01:13:09.957
Okay, listen.

01:13:11.126 --> 01:13:13.253
I've asked Anoushka
to bring Rosa over.

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:17.556
Thought maybe you'd talk to her,
if you don't want to talk to us.

01:13:18.835 --> 01:13:21.497
- Don't make that face at me.
- Nat, don't.

01:13:21.604 --> 01:13:24.664
- But I care about her and I...
- You don't care!

01:13:25.741 --> 01:13:27.935
Actually,
I think she does, sweetheart.

01:13:29.044 --> 01:13:31.478
She doesn't care that
the world might end.

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:34.479
Of course I do!

01:13:34.584 --> 01:13:36.484
I'm on your side, Ginger.

01:13:36.586 --> 01:13:38.281
You don't know anything.

01:13:38.387 --> 01:13:40.218
Well, what else
doesn't she know?

01:13:42.959 --> 01:13:44.426
Ginger?

01:13:44.527 --> 01:13:47.155
I can't say it.

01:13:47.263 --> 01:13:49.162
I'll explode if I say it.

01:13:49.264 --> 01:13:51.824
No, you won't, sugar.
It's all right.

01:13:51.933 --> 01:13:55.335
- Speak it out.
- I can't.

01:13:59.275 --> 01:14:01.300
We're all going to die!
You said it!

01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:03.037
No.

01:14:03.145 --> 01:14:05.238
No, I said we could.

01:14:07.683 --> 01:14:10.947
A nuclear war would probably
obliterate us all if it happened...

01:14:11.052 --> 01:14:13.953
but that's not what
you mean, is it?

01:14:14.055 --> 01:14:16.889
Then what is it you
can't say, Ginger?

01:14:17.493 --> 01:14:19.017
What can't you say?

01:14:23.633 --> 01:14:25.032
That...

01:14:26.903 --> 01:14:28.370
That...

01:14:30.139 --> 01:14:32.368
Roland is...

01:14:32.474 --> 01:14:34.271
Roland is sleeping...

01:14:34.376 --> 01:14:36.811
with Rosa.

01:14:40.716 --> 01:14:42.240
What?

01:14:45.154 --> 01:14:46.246
Rosa?

01:14:52.128 --> 01:14:53.595
Is it true?

01:14:55.096 --> 01:14:56.564
I knew it.

01:14:58.234 --> 01:15:00.998
I knew something was
going on and you...

01:15:01.103 --> 01:15:04.595
- It's all my fault.
- No, no. Of course it's not.

01:15:04.707 --> 01:15:06.607
How long has
this been going on?

01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:08.267
Oh, for God's sake, Natalie.

01:15:10.246 --> 01:15:11.770
Let go of me.

01:15:11.881 --> 01:15:13.849
Let go of me!

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.911
Got to get ahold of Anoushka.

01:15:17.019 --> 01:15:19.852
I don't want to see Rosa.
I don't want to see that little bitch!

01:15:19.956 --> 01:15:23.187
I've got to get out onto the streets.
The leaflets...

01:15:23.292 --> 01:15:25.351
- No, not now, darling.
- Oh, yes, now!

01:15:25.461 --> 01:15:28.726
Don't you understand?
The world may be about to end.

01:15:28.831 --> 01:15:31.425
- It's all right.
- Do you see what you've done?

01:15:35.004 --> 01:15:37.235
What right have
you to judge me?

01:15:38.975 --> 01:15:42.103
I've spent my entire life...

01:15:42.211 --> 01:15:43.735
fighting against tyranny.

01:15:43.846 --> 01:15:45.780
Congratulations.

01:15:45.881 --> 01:15:47.542
Not only the tyranny
of government...

01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:49.481
but also the tyranny...

01:15:49.585 --> 01:15:53.351
of the "shoulds" and the "oughts"
of so-called normal family life.

01:15:53.456 --> 01:15:55.253
Oh, how fucking convenient.

01:15:55.358 --> 01:15:57.884
And who the fuck are
you to lecture me?

01:16:00.496 --> 01:16:02.157
We've only just met.

01:16:02.264 --> 01:16:05.563
And not that it's any of your business,
but Natalie and I are separated.

01:16:06.168 --> 01:16:07.726
You have a child together.

01:16:08.804 --> 01:16:10.431
She's no longer a child.

01:16:11.774 --> 01:16:14.038
Ginger may be grown
up enough...

01:16:14.143 --> 01:16:18.342
to try to save us all from
nuclear catastrophe, Roland...

01:16:18.448 --> 01:16:20.575
but she's also young enough
to still need some looking after.

01:16:20.684 --> 01:16:21.946
Listen.

01:16:22.052 --> 01:16:27.216
Autonomous thought,
personal truth, freedom of action.

01:16:27.323 --> 01:16:30.224
- You believe in those, don't you, Mark?
- Yes, of course I do, but...

01:16:30.326 --> 01:16:34.262
Well, these have been
my guiding principles.

01:16:34.363 --> 01:16:38.164
I deeply believe in them,
and I was jailed for them.

01:16:46.842 --> 01:16:48.400
Don't you see, Ginger?

01:16:48.511 --> 01:16:52.845
There would not even be the possibility
of nuclear war, or any war...

01:16:52.948 --> 01:16:56.679
if millions of men had been prepared to
stand up against authority, as I did...

01:16:56.786 --> 01:16:59.017
and refuse to join the army...

01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:02.658
refuse to take orders.

01:17:02.759 --> 01:17:05.557
It's mindless obedience
that's the killer.

01:17:07.997 --> 01:17:10.693
I've broken the rules.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.529
All the rules.

01:17:12.635 --> 01:17:14.830
Because someone
has to say no.

01:17:14.937 --> 01:17:16.529
Mark, please, no.

01:17:16.639 --> 01:17:19.803
Nat, ducky, we've got to get this
sorted out, for once and for all.

01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:21.741
Come on.
Come. Come.

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:25.648
Oh, Ginger.

01:17:25.749 --> 01:17:27.717
She's sleeping with Roland.

01:17:27.818 --> 01:17:29.648
- Who?
- Rosa.

01:17:29.752 --> 01:17:31.049
What?

01:17:33.722 --> 01:17:35.019
Rosa?

01:17:36.792 --> 01:17:38.259
With Roland?

01:17:51.307 --> 01:17:52.831
Is it true?

01:18:08.658 --> 01:18:10.387
Rosa?

01:18:12.795 --> 01:18:14.490
Answer me, Rosa.

01:18:15.664 --> 01:18:18.360
- Why should I?
- Because I'm your mother.

01:18:21.605 --> 01:18:23.596
I didn't notice.

01:18:35.784 --> 01:18:38.184
Do you think Mum's all right?

01:18:38.287 --> 01:18:39.778
Come.
Come.

01:18:46.596 --> 01:18:48.063
Nat?

01:18:48.165 --> 01:18:50.326
Nat, darling.
Nat.

01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:53.059
Can we come in?

01:18:54.337 --> 01:18:55.964
Right.
We're coming in.

01:18:57.006 --> 01:18:58.564
Nat, open the door.

01:18:59.608 --> 01:19:01.099
Nat, open this door!

01:19:01.211 --> 01:19:03.179
Natty, open up!

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.145
Roland!
Come quick!

01:19:05.949 --> 01:19:07.712
Darling, come on.
Come on.

01:19:11.521 --> 01:19:13.250
Mum!

01:19:18.761 --> 01:19:20.285
Nat.

01:19:21.198 --> 01:19:22.722
Nat.

01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:28.937
Oh, darling.

01:19:31.408 --> 01:19:33.000
Call an ambulance.

01:19:33.109 --> 01:19:35.202
Ginger.

01:19:36.146 --> 01:19:38.137
Forgive me?
Please?

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.958
We had a dream...

01:20:34.571 --> 01:20:37.438
that we would always
be best friends.

01:20:45.349 --> 01:20:47.111
When we were born...

01:20:49.853 --> 01:20:52.185
for some it was the end.

01:20:56.059 --> 01:20:59.358
Now it seems there
may not be tomorrow.

01:21:05.202 --> 01:21:07.067
But despite the horror...

01:21:09.572 --> 01:21:11.039
and the sorrow...

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.380
I love our world.

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:27.421
I want us all to live.

01:21:33.496 --> 01:21:35.088
Now, Rosa...

01:21:36.533 --> 01:21:38.398
you've asked me to forgive.

01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:47.639
One day...

01:21:47.745 --> 01:21:50.612
if Mum survives
this bitter night...

01:21:58.054 --> 01:21:59.783
then we shall meet again...

01:22:02.625 --> 01:22:04.093
and I will say...

01:22:08.933 --> 01:22:10.992
I loved you, Rosa.

01:22:15.739 --> 01:22:17.536
Don't you see?

01:22:21.611 --> 01:22:23.238
But we are different.

01:22:27.385 --> 01:22:30.252
You dream of everlasting love.

01:22:35.493 --> 01:22:37.016
Not me.

01:22:46.437 --> 01:22:48.701
Because what
really matters...

01:22:53.577 --> 01:22:55.169
is to live.

01:23:02.919 --> 01:23:04.750
And if we do...

01:23:09.393 --> 01:23:11.623
there will be nothing
to forgive.

01:23:20.271 --> 01:23:22.135
What are you writing?

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.433
Oh, a poem...

01:23:26.544 --> 01:23:28.341
about the future.

01:23:42.092 --> 01:23:44.082
I'm sorry, Ginger.

01:23:53.838 --> 01:23:55.465
I'm so sorry.

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.424
But I'll forgive you anyway.
