WEBVTT

00:23.898 --> 00:25.649
Hey, what do you think
about Italian?

00:25.650 --> 00:26.984
For a first date?

00:26.984 --> 00:29.319
Depends. We talkin'
pizza or pasta?

00:29.320 --> 00:30.612
It's so complicated.

00:34.283 --> 00:35.784
Ted, my sword!

00:35.785 --> 00:37.912
Hang on, dude,
I got something cooler.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.796
You should invite her
on a study date.

00:46.796 --> 00:47.838
Everyone loves to study.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.023
Oh, man, no perps?

01:06.023 --> 01:08.025
We were up all night
farming this guy.

01:09.318 --> 01:11.820
All night? All night?

01:11.821 --> 01:13.948
Do you know what this means?

01:15.950 --> 01:17.576
We're late for class!

01:29.755 --> 01:31.047
Come on, Ki.

01:31.048 --> 01:32.090
Coming!

01:34.135 --> 01:35.177
Delivery.

01:40.349 --> 01:41.391
Let's go.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.488
Class is canceled?

02:36.489 --> 02:40.159
Score! More time for questing.
B.D., I'm looking at you.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.119
Oh, sorry, dude.
I gotta go get ready.

02:42.119 --> 02:44.037
We're meeting the new
FPS coach today.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.415
Aw, man, there's always
an FPS thing.

02:46.415 --> 02:48.041
What about it, Ki?

02:48.042 --> 02:49.626
Want to grind some mobs?

02:49.627 --> 02:51.920
How can you think about
grinding at a time like this?

02:51.921 --> 02:53.297
We have no class.

02:53.297 --> 02:55.299
I haven't learned
anything in weeks.

02:55.299 --> 02:56.800
I'm off to yell at Calhoun.

03:00.763 --> 03:04.183
Whatever. I guess I'll nab
some z's before drift class.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.435
Psych. I don't get sleepy, b.D.

03:06.435 --> 03:09.938
I get gamey.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.941
I get game...

03:11.941 --> 03:13.192
Oh, man, I'm tired.

03:14.902 --> 03:16.945
Here. You could use
the extra fuel.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.405
Oh, yeah!

03:20.282 --> 03:22.617
Brian! Thank god. Hold this.

03:22.618 --> 03:24.202
What is all this stuff, Jenny?

03:24.203 --> 03:25.746
Playbooks, kill reels,

03:25.746 --> 03:27.956
anything to show the
new coach 1 am awesome!

03:27.957 --> 03:29.500
Still gunning for varsity, huh?

03:29.500 --> 03:32.211
Oh, yeah, whatever gets me
taped to that flagpole.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.087
Wait, they tape you
to a flagpole?

03:34.088 --> 03:35.672
It's an old varsity tradition.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.132
Plus I'm going to lose my mind

03:37.133 --> 03:39.635
if 1 have to
keep babysitting J.V.

03:39.635 --> 03:41.678
Oh, not you.
I mean, you're great.

03:41.679 --> 03:44.431
It's just... them.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.684
One... two-three!

03:46.684 --> 03:47.726
Oh, yeah.

03:50.187 --> 03:52.314
Stow it, nerds! The trial's on!

03:54.316 --> 03:57.485
Well, another bad day in court
for VGHS superstar the Law,

03:57.486 --> 03:59.279
accused of first-degree hacking

03:59.280 --> 04:01.490
by the anti-aimbot association.

04:01.490 --> 04:03.992
Word has come in that
former FPS coach Bob Jackson

04:03.993 --> 04:05.619
has fled to Zanzibar,

04:05.619 --> 04:08.663
refusing to testify
on Law's behalf.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.085
Hey. How y'all doin' out there?

04:13.085 --> 04:15.337
Thanks for coming out.
Really means a lot.

04:15.337 --> 04:17.297
All right, let's just
get through this.

04:17.298 --> 04:21.510
Um... in light of these super
bogus cheating allegations,

04:21.510 --> 04:24.513
and out of respect to VGHS,

04:24.513 --> 04:27.349
the last place in the world
that truly believes in me,

04:27.349 --> 04:29.351
my legal team and I...

04:30.936 --> 04:33.146
Feel it's in my best interest

04:33.147 --> 04:35.732
to punch through
my prepared statement,

04:35.733 --> 04:37.234
fire my legal team,

04:37.234 --> 04:39.277
and swear vengeance on the loser

04:39.278 --> 04:41.905
who dared frame the Law!

04:41.906 --> 04:44.867
You"re going down, buddy,
just like this podium!

04:47.036 --> 04:49.538
No! 1 never cheat
and I never lose!

04:49.538 --> 04:51.164
Your boasts fuel me!

04:51.165 --> 04:53.709
I'm all gassed up
and ready to ride!

04:53.709 --> 04:55.001
Whoo!

04:55.002 --> 04:57.129
I can't believe
I dated that guy.

04:57.129 --> 04:58.463
Yeah. What...?

05:00.382 --> 05:01.758
Um...

05:01.759 --> 05:04.136
So, I was gonna grab
some pizza and pasta

05:04.136 --> 05:05.762
with Ted and Ki.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.389
At romero's tonight, but...

05:07.389 --> 05:10.600
They kind of want to just
stay inside and hang out.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.602
Do you want to come?

05:12.853 --> 05:14.104
Okay.

05:14.104 --> 05:15.396
Wha... really?

05:15.397 --> 05:16.523
Mm-hmm.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.775
Awesome.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.486
1-1 was thinking around seven.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.362
Oh, are they allergic to
anything, because I could make

05:22.363 --> 05:24.656
my seven-nut
shellfish onion dip.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.949
Oh, no.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.785
Uh, they"re not coming.

05:27.785 --> 05:30.454
Um, it was just gonna be
the two of us.

05:30.454 --> 05:33.582
Grab some Italian food
and maybe catch a movie.

05:33.582 --> 05:36.835
Just... you know, hang out.

05:36.836 --> 05:40.256
Doesn't really sound
like hanging out, Brian.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.341
Sounds like you're
asking me on a...

05:42.341 --> 05:44.009
What is that called?

05:44.009 --> 05:45.385
You know, when you like someone

05:45.386 --> 05:47.179
and you're asking
them on... what?

05:47.179 --> 05:48.680
A date.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.057
Yes.

05:50.057 --> 05:54.352
I am asking you
on a date, Jenny.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.188
Please come to my date.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.399
Okay.

06:06.282 --> 06:09.410
Thirty seconds late, Jenny.
Off to a bad start.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.744
Mom?

06:10.744 --> 06:12.746
Coach Matrix. Fall in.

06:30.431 --> 06:33.642
Asleep at the wheel, Theodore?

06:33.642 --> 06:35.518
Sorry, d.K. Long night.

06:35.519 --> 06:37.938
Ah. No doubt toiling
over the book report

06:37.938 --> 06:39.773
you were about to give me.

06:39.773 --> 06:42.150
The one that's due today.

06:42.151 --> 06:44.194
Book...

06:44.194 --> 06:45.570
Report?

06:53.078 --> 06:55.538
Aw, shucks,
I left it in my room.

06:55.539 --> 06:57.290
Can I just get it to you Monday?

06:57.291 --> 06:58.792
You didn't do it, did you?

06:58.792 --> 07:00.084
No way.

07:00.085 --> 07:02.921
I super did it. I swear.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.049
If you speak the truth,

07:05.049 --> 07:09.136
then deliver unto me
at the FPS tourney the report.

07:09.136 --> 07:11.513
You want it by tomorrow?

07:11.513 --> 07:13.181
I wanted it by today.

07:17.269 --> 07:20.689
We have an FPS team in shambles,

07:20.689 --> 07:22.482
with sponsors dropping
like flies,

07:22.483 --> 07:25.486
and you bring on a wild card
like Mary Matrix?

07:25.486 --> 07:27.696
For the sake of your job,
Calhoun,

07:27.696 --> 07:29.489
I hope you made
the right choice.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.326
Not the right choice;
The only choice.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.828
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a school to run.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.957
What the crap do you two want?

07:38.958 --> 07:40.709
Tell Freddie
to give me homework.

07:40.709 --> 07:43.044
We haven't had
an assignment in weeks.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.213
You want homework?
Didn't you come here to play video games?

07:45.214 --> 07:46.673
Actually, I came here
to learn about gamers:

07:46.674 --> 07:47.758
What makes them tick, and...

07:47.758 --> 07:49.509
<i>TL;DR, Ki. Nobody cares.</i>

07:49.510 --> 07:51.720
Freddie, come on.
You know the rules.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.971
I know I rule.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.308
Just give her homework
each week.

07:57.309 --> 07:58.601
This is a school, goddamn it.

07:58.602 --> 08:00.145
Ugh, fine, fine.

08:00.145 --> 08:04.190
<i>Uh, Ki, your homework
for every week.</i>

08:04.191 --> 08:05.525
Forever

08:05.526 --> 08:08.153
is to do no homework.

08:08.153 --> 08:10.113
Nice try, Freddie,
but I don't think that counts.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.241
- That counts.
- What?

08:12.241 --> 08:13.283
In your face!

08:16.537 --> 08:18.372
<i>Just breathe, Ki.</i>

08:18.372 --> 08:19.998
Keep it together.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.375
Dean Calhoun,
I respectively request.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.585
To be withdrawn
from Freddie's class.

08:23.585 --> 08:25.545
Yeah, no. No, you don't
get to do that.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.297
You don't get to withdraw
from class,

08:27.297 --> 08:29.382
you have to get kicked out
by the teacher.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.551
And that ain't never gonna
happen, you ugly narc!

08:31.552 --> 08:33.886
But... okay, but that
doesn't make any sense.

08:33.886 --> 08:35.429
There's got to be
a loophole or something.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.683
Why don't you go look for
that loophole elsewhere?

08:37.683 --> 08:40.936
If you two don't mind,
I have a school to run.

08:40.936 --> 08:43.395
Hm!

08:43.397 --> 08:44.689
That's what "m talking about."

08:44.690 --> 08:46.358
I knew I could count
on you, my man.

08:46.358 --> 08:48.943
Right there. Laying it down,
large and in charge.

08:48.944 --> 08:50.320
Gimme the bones.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.905
Pound it. Right here.

08:52.906 --> 08:55.408
Pound me. Knuckle sandwich.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.161
So you lost your
star player. Big whoop.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.164
You know what's better
than a star player?

09:00.164 --> 09:03.876
- Having a star team.
- No. A star coach. That's me.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.586
As head coach of
the Denver commandoes,

09:05.586 --> 09:07.421
I have never lost
a pro championship,

09:07.421 --> 09:09.089
and I'm sure as hell
not going to start

09:09.089 --> 09:10.381
at the high school level.

09:10.382 --> 09:11.966
I do not like wasting time.

09:11.967 --> 09:14.552
Speaking of which, J.V.,
I can't bother with you,

09:14.553 --> 09:16.304
so you just do
whatever it is that you do.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.098
Varsity, let's talk business.

09:18.098 --> 09:21.267
This is the new playbook.

09:21.268 --> 09:23.937
Banged it out last night.
Memorize it by game time.

09:23.937 --> 09:26.022
Memorize a million moves
by Monday morning?

09:26.023 --> 09:28.442
Ms. Matrix,
that's marble madness!

09:28.442 --> 09:30.569
You're cut from
the team, alliterator.

09:30.569 --> 09:31.861
Anyone else?

09:31.862 --> 09:33.363
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

09:33.363 --> 09:34.739
Goodbye, everybody.

09:34.740 --> 09:39.240
So I'll see the rest
of you at the game.

09:40.788 --> 09:41.997
Dismissed.

09:45.125 --> 09:46.167
Move it.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.254
So your mom's the new coach.

09:49.254 --> 09:51.798
That's, uh, cool, right?

09:51.799 --> 09:53.634
I'll see you at seven, Brian.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.677
Okay, yeah. See you at my place.

09:56.845 --> 09:57.887
My place...?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.356
Trying to butter up
the new coach?

10:08.357 --> 10:11.818
Yeah, so I can handle our
annual phone call, but, um,

10:11.819 --> 10:13.779
is there a reason
why you're here?

10:13.779 --> 10:16.448
Yeah, Calhoun called in a
favor, and I thought, why not?

10:16.448 --> 10:18.950
I'll stop my daughter
from screwing up her career.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.828
Okay. You're here.
Whatever. Yay.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.581
About that spot
on varsity, I want it.

10:24.581 --> 10:27.292
- And when you're ready forit, I'll...
- Ready? Are you serious?

10:27.292 --> 10:29.752
Is there anything else?
I have a game that I need to prep for.

10:29.753 --> 10:31.671
Story of my life.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.256
Good talk, mom.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.097
That's the last rule book.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.515
There are no loopholes.

10:41.515 --> 10:44.059
I'll never have homework again.

10:44.059 --> 10:45.393
Oh, god.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.396
Hey, kiwi.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.106
Got the homework blues?

10:49.106 --> 10:50.565
Me too.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.859
I'm gonna be up all night
doing this long,

10:52.860 --> 10:55.696
boring, succulent,

10:55.696 --> 10:58.407
savory homework.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.991
<i>Man, 'm hungry.</i>

10:59.992 --> 11:01.284
And sleepy.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.703
Do you want to split
a pizza and go to bed?

11:02.703 --> 11:04.496
Hey, Ted, I need your help!

11:04.496 --> 11:05.997
You got it, best friend!

11:05.998 --> 11:08.375
Ted, wait! You left your home...

11:09.918 --> 11:10.960
Work.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.932
Okay, man, this place is books!

11:23.932 --> 11:27.685
Now I've really got to hit
the clean this place spotless.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.729
All right, thanks, buddy.

11:29.730 --> 11:33.525
Hey, what do you think...
Tommy vercetti or Max Payne?

11:33.525 --> 11:36.110
I don't want to smell like
a guy with nothing to lose...

11:36.111 --> 11:38.321
Or do 17?

11:38.322 --> 11:40.949
No, no, no, no.
Ted, you gotta wake up, man.

11:40.949 --> 11:42.533
Jenny's gonna
be here any second!

11:45.913 --> 11:46.955
I'll get it.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.590
- Why, hello.
- Got a moment?

11:57.591 --> 12:01.177
Uh, sure thing, miss...
Coach. What's up?

12:01.178 --> 12:03.305
It smells like you got a date,
so I"ll just cut to the chase.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.890
1 just talked to varsity.
Whew, they hate you.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.934
Oh. Good?

12:07.935 --> 12:09.269
Yeah, I said the same thing.

12:09.269 --> 12:10.770
See, I need someone
to make them mad,

12:10.771 --> 12:12.314
to light a fire
under their asses,

12:12.314 --> 12:14.524
and your ass is that fire.

12:14.524 --> 12:17.443
So, 1 am starting you
in the varsity game tomorrow.

12:17.444 --> 12:19.362
What?

12:19.363 --> 12:21.031
Jenny.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.783
Uh, Benny. Ted Benny.
My roommate Ted Benny.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.244
The stories I could tell you
about Ted Benny.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.081
Oh, man, m sure he's on one
of his classic jams again.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.123
Uh, bear me.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.628
Hey, you.

12:34.628 --> 12:37.464
Do you mind if we skip dinner
and just stay in tonight?

12:37.464 --> 12:39.632
But, um, the dip, the dip...
Where's the dip?

12:39.633 --> 12:42.552
Dip? Oh, 1 must have forgot.

12:42.552 --> 12:44.428
<i>Look, Jenny, just because
Ted and Ki aren't here.</i>

12:44.429 --> 12:45.930
Doesn't mean I don't want dip.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.724
Okay.

12:47.724 --> 12:50.560
Um... I think I have
some picante in my room.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.853
That sounds great.
Yeah, go get that.

12:54.022 --> 12:55.023
Please.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.609
Okay. Sure.

12:59.611 --> 13:01.279
Oh, bring chips, too.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.996
Oh, he's so funny!

13:08.996 --> 13:10.831
Oh, my goodness!

13:10.831 --> 13:12.165
Oh, that's so funny.

13:12.165 --> 13:13.416
So, about tomorrow's game,

13:13.417 --> 13:15.043
I really think
that who you should...

13:15.043 --> 13:16.836
I'll see you at the game, Brian.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.131
Yes, ma'am.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.304
Bad tie.

13:30.058 --> 13:31.809
My goodness.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.312
Here's your salsa, weirdo.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.148
Jenny, wait. Listen,
we gotta talk, all right?

13:36.148 --> 13:38.400
- Your mom wants...
- Brian, please.

13:41.028 --> 13:44.573
Do you mind if we
just relax tonight?

13:46.867 --> 13:49.077
We need chips.

13:49.077 --> 13:51.120
We need chips. Ahem. Chips.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.416
Brb.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.759
Come on, Ted.
Come on, Ted, be awake.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.302
Ted!

14:05.302 --> 14:07.262
Jenny's here, in her pj's.

14:07.262 --> 14:10.223
She looks adorable.
I think we"re gonna cuddle!

14:10.223 --> 14:13.726
But... but... her mom wants
to start me in varsity tomorrow,

14:13.727 --> 14:15.270
but she wants to start tomorrow,

14:15.270 --> 14:17.981
and if I tell her,
that's gonna ruin our date.

14:17.981 --> 14:19.857
- Dude, what do I do?
- Brian?

14:21.068 --> 14:22.402
Ki1?

14:22.402 --> 14:23.694
Brian, do you have any homework?

14:23.695 --> 14:25.071
What? Where's Ted?

14:25.072 --> 14:26.615
Oh, 1 don't know,
and I don't care.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.284
1 just finished his homework,
and I need more.

14:29.284 --> 14:31.160
- What do I do?
- Have you tried...?

14:31.161 --> 14:33.079
Welcome to varsity, Brian!

14:33.080 --> 14:34.414
Ha ha ha ha ha!

14:35.749 --> 14:39.419
Brian? Brian? Brian?

14:39.419 --> 14:43.714
One second, Brian, I have
another phone call coming in.

14:43.715 --> 14:46.008
<i>Hello, Ki's phone.
This is Ki speaking.</i>

14:46.009 --> 14:47.260
Hello, Ki.

14:47.260 --> 14:48.970
This isn't what it looks like.

14:48.970 --> 14:51.514
Looks like you"re
doing your homework.

14:51.515 --> 14:54.518
This is not mine, I promise.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.978
Oh, if it's not yours, that's...

14:56.978 --> 14:58.312
Wait a minute.

14:58.313 --> 15:00.023
Not doing your homework...

15:00.023 --> 15:02.400
Isn't that the homework
I assigned you?

15:03.902 --> 15:06.154
"F" stands for more
than just Freddie, Ki.

15:06.154 --> 15:07.947
It also stands for "you fail"!

15:07.948 --> 15:10.367
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.413
<i>You're failing my class, Ki.</i>

15:18.166 --> 15:19.167
No.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.586
Oh, god.

15:32.931 --> 15:34.265
Brian?

15:46.611 --> 15:48.279
So...

15:48.280 --> 15:49.572
You're starting tomorrow.

15:51.366 --> 15:53.284
Yeah.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.161
Sorry. I wanted to tell you,

15:55.162 --> 15:56.538
1 just...

15:56.538 --> 15:58.164
I mean, you said yes
to us dating...

15:58.165 --> 16:00.458
Or at least going on a date...

16:00.459 --> 16:02.210
And I...

16:02.210 --> 16:04.045
I didn't want to ruin it.

16:04.045 --> 16:06.130
Yeah, I get it.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.383
You"re probably pretty pissed.

16:08.383 --> 16:09.759
Oh, yeah.

16:09.759 --> 16:12.178
Well, if it makes you
feel better,

16:12.179 --> 16:16.016
I had a wedgie before
they put me up here,

16:16.016 --> 16:18.351
and everything I do
makes it worse.

16:20.979 --> 16:22.814
Well, settle in.

16:22.814 --> 16:24.774
You've got a long night
ahead of you,

16:24.774 --> 16:28.027
and an entire playbook to learn.

16:28.028 --> 16:31.364
If I grovel some more,
will you cut me down?

16:31.364 --> 16:35.034
And ruin 40 years of tradition?
Fat chance.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.495
Okay.

16:37.496 --> 16:40.165
Page one. The Panama
pincer formation.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.791
You have two guys on the left,

16:41.791 --> 16:44.001
and the rest of your team
stays back on base.

16:44.002 --> 16:46.295
At second 30, you send out
the rest of the team...

17:03.855 --> 17:05.940
Good morning.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.654
Oh, crap, I forgot my homework!

17:10.654 --> 17:12.864
So both assaults flank left.

17:12.864 --> 17:13.906
Exactly.

17:15.157 --> 17:16.534
Pie puppy! What's going on?

17:16.535 --> 17:17.868
The Law's verdict came in.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.633
The Law, in regards
to the charge

17:31.633 --> 17:33.718
of aimbotting
in the first degree,

17:33.718 --> 17:35.636
we find you... guilty.

17:37.180 --> 17:39.849
On behalf of "field of fire"
customer support,

17:39.849 --> 17:41.600
your account is hereby banned
for a period of no shorter

17:41.601 --> 17:42.852
than, like, forever.

17:44.980 --> 17:48.191
What?!

17:48.191 --> 17:52.691
Also, the VGHS varsity FPS team
is stripped of its victories

17:52.737 --> 17:55.906
and banned from this year's
high school championship.

17:55.907 --> 17:57.617
What?!

17:57.617 --> 17:59.952
Thank you for contacting
customer support,

17:59.953 --> 18:03.748
and my god have mercy
on your soul!

18:05.083 --> 18:07.085
Wait. So does that mean...?

18:07.085 --> 18:08.586
It means the season's over.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.547
Varsity can't even
go to playoffs.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.843
Well, peace, guys.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.302
I'm going to Yale.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.596
Heard they need a sniper.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.557
Did you even read
your contract, Mary?

18:20.557 --> 18:21.808
You signed on for a season.

18:21.808 --> 18:23.142
- No dice.
- Don't you dice me.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.602
Ernie, it's been real.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.521
Have your lawyers
call my lawyers.

18:26.521 --> 18:27.855
That won't be necessary.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.899
What the hell is this?

18:29.899 --> 18:31.817
A loophole.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.344
And it looks like this game
is finally getting under...

18:57.344 --> 19:00.347
Wait a minute.
Is this the J.V. Team?

19:00.347 --> 19:01.931
What the heck is
Mary Matrix thinking?

19:01.931 --> 19:04.391
If she just received the same
news bulletin I did,

19:04.392 --> 19:07.937
she's thinking, thank god
for weird student Ki Swan,

19:07.937 --> 19:09.563
who just discovered a loophole

19:09.564 --> 19:11.774
allowing J.V.
To take varsity's place

19:11.775 --> 19:14.611
in VGHS's bid
for the championship.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.571
I guess since technically
the CSA's ruling

19:16.571 --> 19:18.990
applies only to varsity,
the J.V. Squad can do...

19:18.990 --> 19:21.367
Well, who cares.
It makes for great TV.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.410
Thanks for watching!

19:32.379 --> 19:34.172
It's just like
any other game, guys.

19:34.172 --> 19:37.216
Except we lose all our games.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.968
Yeah, well, not this time.

19:41.012 --> 19:43.222
- Let's go!
- Video game!

19:56.903 --> 19:58.946
- Go for the bomb.
- Thirty seconds to plant.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.089
Yeah! Yes!

20:18.007 --> 20:20.134
Cyberdwarves! Cyberdwarves!

20:20.135 --> 20:22.053
Ki, there you are.

20:22.053 --> 20:23.971
Have you seen my... backpack?

20:23.972 --> 20:27.100
Oh. All right.
Let's do this thing.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.684
Oh, wait, um... I already...

20:28.685 --> 20:30.853
Ted, uh...

20:30.854 --> 20:33.106
Be that what I think it be?

20:35.483 --> 20:37.067
By my troth!

20:37.068 --> 20:39.945
This is... amazing.

20:39.946 --> 20:44.325
<i>"A" -plus. The best paper
've ever looked at.</i>

20:44.325 --> 20:46.160
So many words.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.705
Ah. It pains me to admit,
old friend,

20:48.705 --> 20:50.331
that I doubted you.

20:50.331 --> 20:52.583
Please accept my apologies...

20:52.584 --> 20:55.169
Yeah, uh, and my corndog.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.096
Yeah!

21:06.473 --> 21:08.308
We love you, games!

21:31.206 --> 21:33.333
They"re coming. Lock it down.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.545
Watch out for sniper fire.

21:37.545 --> 21:39.630
Ha ha! You talkin' to...?

22:05.198 --> 22:07.325
Where's the bomb?

22:26.928 --> 22:28.721
Tie game,

22:28.721 --> 22:31.974
and VGHS scores by the skin
of their lucky underpants.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.811
They'll need more than
underpants to close the deal

22:34.811 --> 22:36.729
against this powerful
cyberdwarf defense

22:36.729 --> 22:38.814
in the final round.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.191
D.k.!

22:40.191 --> 22:41.775
Take it back.

22:41.776 --> 22:43.360
I didn't write that paper.

22:43.361 --> 22:46.572
I don't know who did, but...
I'm really sorry.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.075
I wanted to do it,
I just... didn't.

22:51.369 --> 22:54.288
There's no excuse. I'm a butt.

22:54.289 --> 22:57.375
Oh, Theodore.

22:57.375 --> 23:01.875
A butt ye may be,
but an honest butt at that.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.589
Ah.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.633
The corndog is yours.

23:05.633 --> 23:07.176
The paper is mine.

23:07.176 --> 23:08.427
By Monday.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.720
You got it!

23:09.721 --> 23:11.013
Yeah!

23:13.057 --> 23:14.266
Whoo! Corndogs!

23:16.728 --> 23:19.647
All right, guys. Final round.

23:19.647 --> 23:20.981
Please tell me that somebody
read my playbook.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.733
- 1 did.
- 1 did.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.402
Special delivery.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.612
Got it??

23:26.613 --> 23:27.655
Go!

24:03.149 --> 24:06.652
Tank up front. Games,
moriarty, make some noise.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.280
Boom.

24:15.078 --> 24:17.538
Aaaahhhh!

24:17.538 --> 24:18.539
- Ohh!
- Aah!

24:25.964 --> 24:27.465
Split!

24:33.096 --> 24:34.722
They"re flanking
left and right...

24:59.998 --> 25:03.876
Here I come! Look out
for jumpin' Jacks!

25:06.129 --> 25:07.296
Aaahhh!

25:12.885 --> 25:16.722
VGHS! VGHS!

25:16.723 --> 25:19.058
Final chance for VGHS.

25:19.058 --> 25:22.811
It all comes down
to Jenny Matrix and Brian D.

25:27.817 --> 25:29.610
Brian, they're on to you!

25:31.029 --> 25:32.447
Don't blow up! Don't blow up!

25:36.492 --> 25:39.036
Jenny, get ready for
the shot of your I...

25:39.037 --> 25:40.204
Unh! Ohh!

26:08.983 --> 26:11.151
VGHS wins!

26:14.989 --> 26:17.491
Hey!

26:17.492 --> 26:20.328
Practice is at five A.M.
don't be late.

26:27.585 --> 26:29.003
Nice loophole, Ki.

26:29.003 --> 26:31.005
Consider yourself off
rhythm gaming.

26:31.005 --> 26:33.215
But I didn't find
a loophole for, um...

26:33.216 --> 26:36.052
<i>Ki. He means
a loophole to his heart.</i>

26:37.428 --> 26:38.470
I hate both of you.

26:40.014 --> 26:41.515
1 won!

26:41.516 --> 26:43.309
You won!

26:43.309 --> 26:45.436
Yes! We won!

26:45.436 --> 26:47.312
Of course we did!

27:04.372 --> 27:05.998
Welcome to varsity.

27:05.998 --> 27:08.542
Thanks. You too.

27:08.543 --> 27:12.421
So... pizza or pasta, hmm?

27:15.258 --> 27:16.884
Brian, I can't.

27:16.884 --> 27:20.178
It sucks, but we're
on varsity now,

27:20.179 --> 27:22.055
and my mom's the coach,

27:22.056 --> 27:24.433
and I'm the captain of varsity.

27:24.433 --> 27:25.725
I have to get us to playoffs.

27:25.726 --> 27:27.644
It's just... it's...

27:27.645 --> 27:28.687
It's too much.

27:31.482 --> 27:33.650
Probably hate me now, huh?

27:35.069 --> 27:37.654
No, Jenny, I don't hate you.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.573
I really like you.

27:41.659 --> 27:42.701
I know.

27:44.495 --> 27:45.662
Friends?

27:51.878 --> 27:54.130
I'll see you
at practice, captain.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.657
This is gonna be
a weird year, Brian.

28:23.534 --> 28:24.576
You said it.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.204
You know what, guys?

28:27.205 --> 28:28.956
As long as the three
of us are together...

28:28.956 --> 28:30.248
Ted! Get back to work!

28:30.249 --> 28:31.917
No questing until
you have ten pages.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.545
Okay, okay. Sorry.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.928
Sorry, buddy.
