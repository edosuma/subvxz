WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.701
[theme music playing]

00:06.774 --> 00:10.042
okay, it looks like
we're all set to go.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.410
The condemned,

00:11.445 --> 00:13.512
lyle victor linkus,

00:13.547 --> 00:15.981
has declined
to make a final statement.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.282
So, at this time,

00:17.318 --> 00:19.852
barring a phone call
from the governor's office,

00:19.887 --> 00:23.555
we will now carry out
the execution.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.291
[phone ringing]

00:26.327 --> 00:27.726
[all gasp]

00:29.096 --> 00:29.962
yes?

00:30.931 --> 00:31.930
Mmm-mmm.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.066
Mmm-mmm.

00:34.101 --> 00:36.769
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong number.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.271
You have
a good evening yourself.

00:39.306 --> 00:44.043
Okay. Let us proceed
with the execution
of mr. Linkus.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.480
You can go on.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.249
Go on!

00:50.284 --> 00:52.051
You can execute him.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.488
[groans]

00:56.524 --> 00:58.857
okeydoke,
that about wraps it up.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.626
We thank you for coming out.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.428
If you enjoyed
a beverage or snack,

01:02.463 --> 01:05.030
we do ask that you
throw those items away
in the receptacle at--

01:05.066 --> 01:07.566
[screaming]

01:09.937 --> 01:12.538
that's okay, that's all right.
That's normal.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.707
That's just the body
going through
its normal processes.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.042
It's just that

01:17.078 --> 01:19.945
remaining air
that is being expelled.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.914
That is not a scream
so much as it is,

01:21.949 --> 01:24.083
just air rushing past
the vocal cords,

01:24.118 --> 01:26.251
-which are taut
from the cocktail.
-[grunting]

01:26.287 --> 01:28.020
[yells]

01:28.055 --> 01:30.222
that's okay, that's all right.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.857
This is all normal.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.559
That's just a spasm.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.562
The body just spasms
long after death.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.632
[grunts]

01:40.668 --> 01:43.902
we went back and forth
on whether we should put
a window in that room.

01:45.072 --> 01:48.540
If I knew then
what I know now,

01:48.576 --> 01:51.944
I can tell you
I would have voted
against that window.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.182
If I only knew then
what I know now.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.722
Team, looks like you're
headed to reidsville, georgia.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.924
Ugh, another
red state mystery.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.428
When are we gonna
get one in la or new york?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.296
Somewhere with some theater.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.932
Now here's the thing.
Coincidently, I have
business in atlanta.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.667
So, maybe I can tag along
on this mystery.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.904
What business
do you have in atlanta?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.772
I have a lady friend
who lives there.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.574
We've been conducting
an online relationship

02:22.610 --> 02:23.976
and she wants
to meet in person.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.445
And, by the way,
she is a lingerie model,

02:26.480 --> 02:27.679
and very rich,

02:27.715 --> 02:29.281
and she's crazy about me.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.049
I don't wanna get ahead
of myself and say "soul mate,"

02:31.085 --> 02:32.351
but this feels like the one.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.253
The dark clouds
are finally partin'.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.522
You're obviously
being catfished, deezy.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.123
Number one, no, I'm not.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.858
Number two,
what the hell is that?

02:39.894 --> 02:41.126
It's nothing, deezy.
[chuckles]

02:41.162 --> 02:43.996
now, she sounds like
a wonderful woman

02:44.031 --> 02:47.032
who definitely does exist.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.867
Thanks for the ride, team.

02:48.903 --> 02:51.069
Thank you for giving us
the pleasure of never
seeing you again,

02:51.105 --> 02:54.439
because you're
about to be murdered
in a catfishing scam.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.275
-Take it easy, brother.
-[engine starts]

02:59.446 --> 03:01.914
um... Natasha?

03:01.949 --> 03:04.349
A nationwide shortage
of sodium thiopental

03:04.385 --> 03:07.519
has thrown
the capital punishment system
into disarray.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.087
So, wait,

03:09.123 --> 03:11.957
you just come up with
a lethal cocktail on your own,

03:11.992 --> 03:14.726
like you're the mixologist
at the hotel bar

03:14.762 --> 03:16.728
who asks for your number
and never calls

03:16.764 --> 03:18.830
but still charges you $22

03:18.866 --> 03:21.466
for a strawberry
hibiscus margarita

03:21.502 --> 03:23.135
that didn't even get me buzzed?

03:23.170 --> 03:24.670
Exactly, fellow.

03:24.705 --> 03:29.975
Except, not only
did lyle victor linkus
not get buzzed,

03:30.010 --> 03:32.144
he acquired
super-human strength.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.079
And you want us
to find him?

03:34.114 --> 03:35.347
Yes, sir.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.216
He could be anywhere
in the surrounding forest?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.350
Yes, sir.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.319
Okay, I don't have
any other questions.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.620
Uh, I do.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.156
Why didn't you call
the fbi or, like, the army?

03:44.191 --> 03:46.725
That is a good question,
young man,

03:46.760 --> 03:48.627
and we went
back and forth on it.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.928
And who knows,

03:49.964 --> 03:51.830
maybe this would turn
into one of those

03:51.865 --> 03:54.766
"if I knew then
what I know now" situations.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.769
[sighs]
like that window.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.473
And these shoes.

04:01.508 --> 04:02.674
Should've got black,

04:02.710 --> 04:03.642
or brown.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.310
But I went with cordovan.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.746
The man said
it goes with everything.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.848
Well, I think
it goes with nothing.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.784
Here, good luck.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.519
I better
get out of this rain.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.823
You know what color
cordovan looks like
when it gets wet?

04:17.858 --> 04:19.691
Dog shit color.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.193
[mike] okay, team, let's go.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.462
Come on, we've got no choice.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.964
[pigeon] wait a second,
we do have a choice.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.899
Or more precisely,

04:27.935 --> 04:29.534
you have a choice.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.804
If you want us
to enter the forest,
text "forest,"

04:32.840 --> 04:36.642
and if you do not want us
to enter the forest
and go home,

04:36.677 --> 04:38.944
text "go home."

04:38.979 --> 04:41.813
we'll give you a moment
to make your choice.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.051
Yup, we got the results.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.387
And the audience wants us to

04:48.422 --> 04:49.755
go home! [laughs]

04:49.790 --> 04:51.723
wow, that's surprising.
[chuckles]

04:51.759 --> 04:54.993
I would have though they'd
want us to go in the forest,

04:55.029 --> 04:57.396
you know,
"go, find that murderer..."
[chuckles]

04:57.431 --> 04:58.697
you build up a thing,

04:58.732 --> 05:01.133
you know, you think
you'd wanna see that through

05:01.168 --> 05:03.368
but, no, the audience has voted

05:03.404 --> 05:04.803
and we must respect that.

05:04.838 --> 05:05.904
Come on, everybody,

05:05.939 --> 05:07.472
to the mystery mobile.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.409
Damn, I wanted to go in there
and find that guy.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.811
Fight him
in hand-to-hand combat.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.946
The ultimate ending to a show.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.416
I am disappointed in you,
audience.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.686
[marquess humming]

05:20.721 --> 05:21.853
[marquess] mmm!

05:21.889 --> 05:24.089
Oh! Remember,
about a month ago

05:24.124 --> 05:26.024
when we went
to reidsville, georgia,

05:26.060 --> 05:27.993
and we were about to go
after that escaped prisoner?

05:28.028 --> 05:29.594
No, remind me again.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.929
That's not important.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.398
Anyway, it says
he came out of the forest

05:33.434 --> 05:35.867
and murdered
a gas station attendant,

05:35.903 --> 05:37.169
stole a vehicle,

05:37.204 --> 05:39.004
was then chased by police

05:39.039 --> 05:41.640
where he drove off a bridge
into a river.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.876
[gasps]
his body was not recovered.
Presumed dead.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.512
Oh, so, it's a happy ending.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.315
Ah, oh, well, except
for that gas station attendant.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.684
But, you know,
that's not, you know,

05:52.720 --> 05:54.353
not really a life, now, is it?

05:54.388 --> 05:56.822
So you're saying that mystery
is officially solved?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.824
Uh, yeah. I guess.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.760
And you saying that's a mystery
that we were involved in
at one point?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.228
Yes, michael.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.497
Great, I'm gonna have
deezy invoice for that.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.967
Deezy! Deezy!
Where are you, fool?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.303
[laughs]
I bet he's taking a shit.

06:11.338 --> 06:14.506
[gasps] oh, my god!
He must still be in atlanta!

06:17.778 --> 06:21.947
Okay, what do we do?
Just fan out and start looking?

06:21.982 --> 06:23.615
Looking for the body.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.517
I mean, he's dead.
We haven't heard
from the guy in a month.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.286
Whoever was catfishing him
obviously murdered him.

06:28.322 --> 06:30.722
Probably [bleep]
his dead body,

06:30.758 --> 06:32.491
probably cut the head off and

06:32.526 --> 06:34.693
[bleep] where
the head once was.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.027
I bet that's what happened.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.596
[gasps] oh, my god. Look!

06:38.465 --> 06:39.464
Deezy.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.369
Oh, man, what, man?

06:44.405 --> 06:45.537
That's not deezy.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.240
What? Why is he wearing
deezy's clothes?

06:48.275 --> 06:51.510
Wait, are we 100% sure
this isn't deezy?

06:51.545 --> 06:54.179
Yung, check his pockets,
see if there're any clues.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.447
Uh, you check his pockets.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.983
Oh, fine. Hi, sir.

06:58.018 --> 07:01.520
Hello. I am going to reach

07:01.555 --> 07:03.989
into your pocket, okay?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.323
Okay, well...

07:05.359 --> 07:07.459
Oh, [gasps]
I think I feel his wallet.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.694
-[yelling]
-[marquess screaming]

07:09.730 --> 07:11.129
stop, stop. Oh.

07:11.165 --> 07:12.964
Get him off me. Michael!

07:13.000 --> 07:16.201
Ugh! You're wet.
Why are you so wet?

07:16.236 --> 07:17.369
Should we do something?

07:17.404 --> 07:19.404
Let's let the audience decide.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.107
For those that want
to let marquess fight

07:22.142 --> 07:24.476
this urine-soaked
homeless man...

07:24.511 --> 07:25.210
[marquess] pigeon!

07:25.245 --> 07:26.912
Dad, do something.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.980
Deezy, deezy, let him go.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.916
[marquess gasping]

07:32.019 --> 07:33.919
ugh! My god!

07:33.954 --> 07:34.920
Here.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.022
This says natasha.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.558
-And it has a phone number.
-Let's call it.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.892
[dialing]

07:40.928 --> 07:42.027
[line rings]

07:42.062 --> 07:43.195
-[deezy]<i> hello.</i>
-Deezy.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.096
<i> Mike? Oh, thank god.</i>

07:45.132 --> 07:46.731
<i> I can't believe</i>
<i> I'm getting reception.</i>

07:46.767 --> 07:48.099
<i> You gotta help me.</i>

07:48.135 --> 07:49.835
Okay, deezy, we're coming.
Where are you?

07:49.870 --> 07:51.470
<i> Oh, man. I don't know.</i>

07:51.505 --> 07:53.839
<i> Somewhere in the woods.</i>
<i> I don't know where I am.</i>

07:53.874 --> 07:55.974
<i> -Mike, you gotta hurry--</i>
-[line disconnects]

07:56.009 --> 07:57.676
oh, damn, the call dropped.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.544
How are we gonna find him?

07:59.580 --> 08:03.448
Easy.
I put a microchip in deezy
right in the back of his neck.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.417
Right at the base of his skull.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.452
He was asleep
and I just chipped him,

08:07.488 --> 08:09.788
so I always know where he's at.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.022
I did it to all of you.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.624
What on earth for?

08:12.659 --> 08:14.526
I have abandonment issues.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.464
We're getting close.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.699
Oh, my god.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.434
Are we back in reidsville?

08:22.469 --> 08:24.336
When were we ever
in reidsville?

08:24.371 --> 08:26.204
[gasps] look, he's off
somewhere to the right.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.239
But turn here.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.241
[tires screeching]

08:33.180 --> 08:35.614
[brakes screech]

08:35.649 --> 08:37.249
deezy, what the hell
happened to you?

08:37.284 --> 08:39.751
Oh, god, it was terrible.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.086
Well, first it was great.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.721
Here, let me tell you
the whole story.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.189
After you guys drove away,

08:44.224 --> 08:45.557
<i>I admit I was a little worried</i>

08:45.592 --> 08:47.125
<i> because I couldn't</i>
<i> find natasha.</i>

08:47.160 --> 08:48.727
<i> And it was</i>
<i> a seedy part of town.</i>

08:48.762 --> 08:50.795
<i> But then I heard the sound</i>
<i> of cameras clicking.</i>

08:50.831 --> 08:52.264
<i> And I saw her.</i>

08:52.299 --> 08:54.399
<i> She was doing</i>
<i> her lingerie photoshoot.</i>

08:54.434 --> 08:56.468
<i> And they chose the location</i>
<i> for that gritty feel.</i>

08:56.503 --> 08:58.537
<i> Natasha insisted that</i>
<i> I be in it with her.</i>

08:58.572 --> 09:01.273
<i> You know, to spice things up.</i>
<i> We made love on camera.</i>

09:01.308 --> 09:02.674
[marquess]<i> oh, my god.</i>

09:02.709 --> 09:04.342
Anyway,

09:04.378 --> 09:06.711
when I went to put
my clothes back on,
they were gone.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.213
I guess someone stole 'em.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.782
But natasha just bought me
a whole new wardrobe.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.651
I told you she was rich.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.920
<i> We spent the next month</i>
<i> just buying things</i>
<i> and making love.</i>

09:14.955 --> 09:18.356
<i> Natasha was so into me,</i>
<i> she said she wanted me</i>
<i> to meet her parents.</i>

09:18.392 --> 09:19.758
<i> On the way, I realized</i>

09:19.793 --> 09:21.459
<i> I shouldn't show up</i>
<i> empty-handed.</i>

09:21.495 --> 09:23.461
<i> So I asked her to pull over</i>
<i> at a gas station</i>

09:23.497 --> 09:25.063
<i> so I can get</i>
<i> a nice bottle of wine.</i>

09:25.098 --> 09:27.232
<i> I didn't have my wallet</i>
<i> so she gave me her purse.</i>

09:27.267 --> 09:29.634
-[man yelling]
<i> -suddenly there was</i>
<i> the most terrifying roar.</i>

09:29.670 --> 09:32.871
<i> And I watched a monster man</i>
<i>kill the gas station attendant</i>
<i> with his bare hands.</i>

09:32.906 --> 09:34.539
<i> Then he jumped</i>
<i> into natasha's car,</i>

09:34.575 --> 09:36.107
<i> with natasha still in it.</i>

09:36.143 --> 09:37.776
<i> So I jumped on the roof</i>
<i> as he sped off.</i>

09:37.811 --> 09:39.678
<i> I climbed to the side</i>
<i> to stop him</i>

09:39.713 --> 09:41.246
<i> and he crashed off the bridge</i>
<i> into the river below.</i>

09:41.281 --> 09:42.614
<i> When I came to,</i>

09:42.649 --> 09:44.282
<i> I saw him carry natasha</i>
<i> into the forest.</i>

09:44.318 --> 09:46.885
I followed his ass,
he keeps her in this cave.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.320
You gotta save her, mike.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.754
So in other words,
you got catfished.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.822
[man screaming]

09:50.857 --> 09:52.123
come on.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.161
He's in there, mike.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.296
You gotta fight him,
hand-to-hand combat.

09:58.332 --> 10:01.299
Yeah, just me against this
super-strong maniac killer.

10:01.335 --> 10:04.436
And we're finally gonna get
the ultimate ending
to this show.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.004
Come on out here,
mother... [bleep]

10:06.039 --> 10:07.973
[lyle yelling]

10:08.008 --> 10:09.040
[growls]

10:09.076 --> 10:09.975
[grunts]

10:10.010 --> 10:11.543
hmm, I hope you're hungry

10:11.578 --> 10:14.446
'cause you're about to get
a knuckle sandwich.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.548
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

10:17.884 --> 10:20.552
oh, damn, I forgot
the warden gave me that pistol.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.687
-But how did it go off?
-[natasha] deezy.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.625
Huh, he wasn't
catfished at all.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.493
[natasha moans]

10:28.528 --> 10:31.830
man, I mean, that's crazy.
All I did was this.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.398
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

10:37.270 --> 10:38.737
sorry, deezy.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.772
