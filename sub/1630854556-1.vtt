Princess cut.

01:31.133 --> 01:35.054
Yeah. Uh, these-these things
don't really feel like her.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.555
Do you have a presidential cut?

01:36.639 --> 01:38.891
How about...

01:38.974 --> 01:40.643
something a little more classic?

01:44.146 --> 01:45.773
That is the one.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.358
You have good taste, Daisy.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.943
Yes, I do.

Sorry, yeah. Um, I'm looking
to get a present for my girlfriend.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.386
I was hoping that one of those blue boxes
would do the trick.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.638
Okay. Anything specific you had in mind?

02:17.721 --> 02:18.973
Not really.

02:19.056 --> 02:22.434
Uh, just hopefully something
that's reasonable.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.979
-All right, let me show you what we have.

02:34.530 --> 02:35.906
(Daisy scoffs)

02:35.990 --> 02:37.908
People are crazy here, huh?

02:37.992 --> 02:39.410

02:43.831 --> 02:45.791
-Do not leave my sight.
-I-I won't.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.128
-ETHAN: You okay, man?
-Yeah.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.589
-ETHAN: You call 911?
-No, but there's an ambulance right there.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.674
-(siren wails) -MAN: Right here, man.
-ETHAN: Hey, you okay, man?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.009
-Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, chill.
-EMT: Hi. I'm a paramedic.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.720
-I got this.
-GARY: Yeah, no, I'm totally fine.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.722
-EMT: Sir, what's your name?
-What?

02:59.805 --> 03:02.224
-No, no, I'm fine.
-Yep, you're okay.

03:03.976 --> 03:04.977
(slurps)

03:05.060 --> 03:07.271
Do you need harissa?

03:08.439 --> 03:10.065
Hmm.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.402
Mmm!

03:13.485 --> 03:15.279
You needed harissa. Perfect.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.197
-Let's boil.
-(stove igniter clicking)

03:17.281 --> 03:19.950
-Great. Actually...
-Are you talking to your fish again?

03:20.034 --> 03:22.328
-No.
-Uh-huh.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.746
I'm talking to my soup.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.831
Oh, okay. Well, I come bearing Eureka.

03:25.915 --> 03:27.291
Oh, my God, thank you.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.084
Yeah. That's just the type of friend I am.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.128
You just asked for lemons,
but I know you like...

03:31.211 --> 03:33.130
BOTH:
Eureka!

03:33.213 --> 03:34.757
Yeah, 'cause you like doing that.

03:34.840 --> 03:35.925
Had to.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.635
Okay, wow!

03:37.718 --> 03:39.845
Casual at-home anniversary, huh?

03:39.929 --> 03:41.555
Ha ha.

03:41.639 --> 03:44.308
Rach, I love that you finally framed this.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.144
I will always love our firstborn.

03:47.227 --> 03:51.315
Even if that one critic did say the
ambiance reminded him of a gas station.

03:51.398 --> 03:55.194
I personally like gas stations.
They have really good snacks.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.029
God, you have such a good attitude.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.447
-It's terrifying.
-(laughs)

03:58.530 --> 03:59.782
Um, I need to change.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.575
Can you simmer the soup
in like two minutes, please?

04:01.659 --> 04:03.619
Okay. You got, uh, food
in your hair, by the way.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.956
-Yeah, right there.
-Hmm? Oh. Oh.

04:07.039 --> 04:10.834
Yo, it's amazing what a mess
you're capable of making.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.629
It looks like you taught a cooking class
to a bunch of toddlers.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.589
Yeah, that's the vibe I was going for.

04:15.673 --> 04:19.385
Um, you should get going 'cause
Gary's gonna be here around 7:00.

04:19.468 --> 04:23.389
Okay, so I guess I'll leave
in, what, like two, three hours, then?

04:23.472 --> 04:26.225
That's hilarious.
What are you, a stand-up comedian?

04:26.308 --> 04:27.726
I been working on a tight five.

04:27.810 --> 04:28.894
(chuckles)

04:28.978 --> 04:31.188
By the way, I saw his write-up
in New York Magazine.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.358
-You did?
-New York's freshest tattoo artist.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.068
I assume you helped with that?

04:37.319 --> 04:39.279
-Hmm.
-Okay, I did.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.032
What? So I sent him
a bunch of our cannoli.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.159
I was like, "Maybe you can put in
a good word with the culture editor,"

04:44.243 --> 04:47.079
-and they did.
-Hmm. Aren't you generous.

04:47.162 --> 04:50.082
You can bribe people with cannoli.
Good to know.

04:50.165 --> 04:53.252
Terri, you haven't said anything
about my outfit.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.545
What do you think?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.880
-You look incredible.
-It's a lot.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.008
It's a lot, but I'm thinking
it's sort of giving off

04:59.091 --> 05:03.345
a J.Lo picking up her kids from school
on the way to the Grammys vibe.

05:03.429 --> 05:04.972
He definitely won't notice
this messy-ass kitchen.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.890
No, he won't.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.726
-(phone vibrating)
-(laughs) Oh, your phone's ringing.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.186
-Oh.
-It's Gary.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.313
(singsongy):
Looks like I'm having fish tonight.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.441
-Terri.
-What?

05:15.524 --> 05:17.526
Hi, honey. You on your way?

05:20.195 --> 05:22.197
I'm sorry, who's this?

05:23.532 --> 05:24.908
What?

05:24.992 --> 05:26.326
(tablet ringing)

05:26.410 --> 05:28.328
I can't find it anywhere.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.706
If I help you find your phone,
will you give me one as a thank-you?

05:30.789 --> 05:33.417
Don't start. And don't tell her,
because you know she hates it.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.585
Hey, hey!

05:34.668 --> 05:36.795
-VANESSA (over tablet): Aloha.
-Mahalo.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.505
-Girl.
-Oh, please.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.382
Like you've never seen Moana.

05:40.466 --> 05:42.217
-How is it going over there?
-It's the best.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.887
All the trees are lit,
we went ice-skating,

05:44.970 --> 05:46.597
and we saw a guy get hit by a car.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.599
-Oh, my God.
-No. It was a good-- really good day,

05:48.682 --> 05:51.435
minus the guy and the car,
but he's fine, I-I think.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.978
You know, we could do it all again
once you get here.

05:53.062 --> 05:54.063
No need.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.774
Yeah, I remember very well,
you know, the crowds, the smells.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.901
I actually like all those things.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.320
-When's your flight get in?
-Uh, tomorrow night at 5:00.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.447
What are you guys gonna do until then?

06:03.530 --> 06:07.242
Well, Daisy's gonna hang out with Nina,
who she hasn't seen since the first grade.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.869
Oh, fun. Okay.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.704
Yeah, while Dad has his meeting.

06:10.788 --> 06:13.499
-What meeting?
-WOMAN: Vanessa, margarita time!

06:13.582 --> 06:14.625
I'm coming.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.337
Okay, I have to go, but I will see you
guys so soon with lots of presents, okay?

06:18.420 --> 06:20.964
DAISY: Have fun on the last day
of your girls' trip.

06:21.048 --> 06:27.179
(sighs) So, here's the thing about
not telling Vanessa about the meeting.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.305
What's wrong?

06:28.388 --> 06:32.267
You said you "think" that man's okay.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.394
Look, sweetie... (stammers)

06:34.478 --> 06:36.647
the ambulance got there really quickly.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.857
But sometimes people aren't okay.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.859
What if he's not?

06:41.860 --> 06:43.570
You're right.

06:43.654 --> 06:46.573
I think he's fine, but in the morning,

06:46.657 --> 06:50.202
we can go to the hospital
and-and check up on him.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.703
Okay.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.789
-(monitor beeping steadily)
-RACHEL: The doctor on call last night

06:53.872 --> 06:55.457
told me that he had a concussion.

06:55.541 --> 06:56.875
How bad is it?

06:56.959 --> 06:59.753
-How do you feel?
-I've felt worse.

06:59.837 --> 07:02.464
Concussion's mild.
You know, no broken bones.

07:02.548 --> 07:03.715
Maybe a bruise here and there.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.717
-That's it?
-That's it.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.719
(sighs) Damn it.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.556
-My phone.
-Your what?

07:10.639 --> 07:12.057
It's cracked.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.976
-(chuckles)
-Yeah, you're right.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.477
It seems like he's gonna be just fine.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.396
All right, well, Rita's got it from here.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.897
-Okay.
-All right.

07:18.981 --> 07:23.569
Okay, so we're holding him for an MRI
because he has some memory loss.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.737
Memory loss? She didn't say anything--

07:25.821 --> 07:27.447
You don't remember
what happened last night?

07:27.531 --> 07:29.324
Not really.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.659
I mean, that can't be good.
That sounds bad.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.536
Is that... is that serious?

07:32.619 --> 07:33.745
He's gonna be fine.

07:33.829 --> 07:36.540
So I should be getting seen
any minute now, right?

07:36.623 --> 07:39.293
Uh, looks like not until tonight,
um, worst-case tomorrow.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.713
-You should go.
-No.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.381
I'm not leaving you here.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.674
Come on. Really.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.301
You should be more worried
about my phone right now.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.719
Stop it.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.262
It's broken.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.722
I'm totally fine.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.973
You should be at the restaurant.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.725
Seriously.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.935
-You sure?
-Yeah.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.896
Okay.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.566
-Bye.
-I'm gonna take your stuff.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.526
This is it.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.236
Take good care of him.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.322
-I love you.
-Love you.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.656
(man speaking indistinctly over P.A.)

08:09.740 --> 08:12.910
Hey, what's the snack situation here?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.453
Hmm?

08:14.536 --> 08:18.832
No, no, we're not family.
We just... we wanted to check up on him.

08:18.916 --> 08:21.460
All we know is that he was hit by a cab.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.712
I'm sorry, I can't release information
on patients,

08:23.795 --> 08:25.088
especially if you don't even
know his name.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.799
Please. We just want to know if he's okay.

08:27.883 --> 08:30.594
All right? He came in last night.
He was hit by a cab in SoHo.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.930
My dad brought him back to life.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.224
No. (stammers)
Um, no, that's-that's not...

08:35.307 --> 08:37.392
DAISY:
But you did. It was because of you.

08:37.476 --> 08:38.518
Excuse me?

08:38.602 --> 08:40.229
-That's not exactly what happened.
-Hi.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.688
Hi.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.817
Sorry to interrupt. I just overheard you--

08:45.901 --> 08:48.195
Were you guys there last night
with the guy that got hit by the taxi?

08:48.278 --> 08:49.488
You know you don't
have to disclose anything.

08:49.571 --> 08:52.407
Oh, no, I know. His name's Gary.
He has a concussion.

08:52.491 --> 08:54.409
-Oh, no.
-Oh, but it's so small.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.119
-He's gonna be totally fine. Yeah.
-ETHAN (sighs): Oh, good.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.913
We're glad to hear that. You hear that, D?

08:57.996 --> 08:59.122
What happened?

08:59.206 --> 09:01.541
Uh, I'm sorry, you guys can't linger here.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.753
If you want to finish this conversation,
you're gonna have to take it elsewhere.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.465
-Are you and Gary married?
-Uh, no, no. We're...

09:08.548 --> 09:10.008
We are-- we're...

09:10.092 --> 09:12.010
-Best friends.
-Well...

09:12.094 --> 09:13.428
Are you a stripper?

09:13.512 --> 09:14.972
-What? (chuckles)
-ETHAN: Wow.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.890
Do you live in New York?

09:16.974 --> 09:19.184
Yeah, I live in, uh, Queens.

09:19.268 --> 09:20.394
-What about you?
-DAISY: L.A.

09:20.477 --> 09:24.314
But we used to live here,
uh, and we might come back.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.316
Well, that's cool.
You can work from either city.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.818
Bicoastal. Fancy.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.903
Uh, kinda.

09:29.987 --> 09:33.240
You know, I-I'm a creative writing
professor at UCLA.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.200
-Cool.
-DAISY: But he's also an author,

09:35.284 --> 09:37.327
and he wants to write another book.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.109
That's gonna be so fun.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.278
Wait, there's only two tickets.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.738
Dais, you can handle yourself, right?

31:04.822 --> 31:06.824
I figured a girls' day might be in order.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.993
Wow. And what are you gonna do?

31:09.076 --> 31:12.079
That three-story Olive Garden
in Times Square looks fun.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.872
(laughs):
Nah, nah.

31:13.956 --> 31:16.417
I-I think I'm gonna try to write.

31:17.501 --> 31:21.714
Yeah, I haven't done it in a while, and
the city is really inspiring me right now.

31:21.797 --> 31:26.468
Wait, you're gonna (chuckles)
write on our vacation?

31:26.552 --> 31:28.137
I-If that's cool.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.806
You know, uh, I asked for
a girls' day out anyway.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.474
So I feel like I could use one.

31:32.558 --> 31:33.934
-Thanks, Dad.
-(sighs)

31:34.018 --> 31:36.895
Yeah. I-I feel very honored.

31:36.979 --> 31:38.856
Um, I will get dressed,
and we will head out.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.941
-Okay? Okay.
-Okay.

31:41.984 --> 31:44.820
-Thank you. Wish me luck.
-Okay.

31:45.863 --> 31:48.866
(door opens, closes)

31:48.949 --> 31:51.160
Please don't tell me
you forgot your phone again.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.954
You got to go get the ring back.

31:54.038 --> 31:55.914
Just remember not to say anything.

31:55.998 --> 31:57.875
I won't say anything.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.668
I won't. Promise.

32:03.464 --> 32:05.424
(door opens, closes)

32:06.425 --> 32:07.968
-TERRI: Hey, Rach.
-Hey.

32:08.052 --> 32:10.304
What did you need again?
It was, uh, black truffles and...

32:10.387 --> 32:12.181
Porcini mushrooms.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.265
Oh, and I talked to the wheelman.

32:13.349 --> 32:15.267
He said he's gonna get the entrées
out of the window much faster tonight.

32:15.351 --> 32:17.269
Perfect. I'm gonna get some more focaccia.

32:17.353 --> 32:18.604
Okay.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.526
TERRI:
Porcini.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.781
-Hi. Uh, sorry, yeah.
-Hi.

32:28.864 --> 32:31.617
Um, I'm-I'm looking for Rachel Meyer.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.577
And who might you be?

32:33.661 --> 32:35.537
-(laughs) Sorry, I'm Ethan.
-Ethan.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.625
Hello again. (chuckles)

32:39.708 --> 32:40.834
Hi.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.920
Mr. East River. Ooh.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.338
Yeah, this is... th-th...

32:44.421 --> 32:46.131
this is Terri, my business partner.

32:46.215 --> 32:49.009
I also identify as her best friend.

32:49.093 --> 32:51.345
Business partner, best friend.
She does it all.

32:51.428 --> 32:54.056
I was actually looking for Gary.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.474
Oh.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.851
Uh... okay.

32:57.935 --> 32:59.520
What do you need Gary for?

32:59.603 --> 33:03.315
Yeah, no, sorry.
I-I thought maybe I could meet him here

33:03.399 --> 33:05.693
or you could connect us,
just to check up on him.

33:05.776 --> 33:07.444
How is he, actually?

33:07.528 --> 33:09.571
-Um...
-You're quite the detective, aren't you?

33:09.655 --> 33:10.823
And fine as hell, too.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.700
-What are those, hazel?
-Terri. Oh, my God. Terri.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.076
-Huh? What?
-(laughs)

33:14.159 --> 33:16.495
I need you-- we need-- can--
we need more focaccia.

33:16.578 --> 33:17.996
Can you go inside
and get some more focaccia?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.915
I know for a fact that
we don't need more focaccia.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.543
But you know what?
I'll go get some ciabatta.

33:22.626 --> 33:23.627
Thank you so much.

33:23.711 --> 33:25.629
-Good day, fine sir.
-Thank you.

33:25.713 --> 33:28.966
-(chuckles): Good day.
-Sorry about that. (laughs)

33:29.049 --> 33:32.094
Um, I'm actually about to go grab a bite
with Gary around the corner.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.595
You want me to give him your number?

33:34.680 --> 33:36.598
Well, I-I was actually hoping
I could meet him.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.017
Oh. Want to eat with me and Gary?

33:39.101 --> 33:41.603
Yeah, that could be cool.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.605
Or I could walk with you.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.650
-Whatever. (chuckles)
-Okay. Sure. Sure.

33:46.734 --> 33:48.193
Absolutely.
I'm gonna put these in the back.

33:48.277 --> 33:50.195
-Okay. (chuckles)
-We'll head out.

33:50.279 --> 33:51.780
Awesome.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.086
-RECEPTIONIST: Gary.
-Oh.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.046
Got time for one more?

34:08.130 --> 34:10.007
(sighs) I should really get going.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.801
Are you sure? This guy requested you, man.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.765
-Ah. Yeah.
-Yeah? Okay.

34:20.225 --> 34:23.645
I'm sure Gary will be here any minute.

34:23.729 --> 34:27.441
(sighs) You know, all good.
I could just wait until he gets here.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.198
Hmm?

34:35.282 --> 34:37.367
(chuckles)

34:37.451 --> 34:39.995
Uh... wow.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.538
Oh! Yes.

34:41.622 --> 34:43.791
I forget that it's-- yes.

34:43.874 --> 34:45.334
Wow.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.003
Christmas morning.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.005
That's-- it--

34:50.088 --> 34:53.258
That looks beautiful on you.

34:53.342 --> 34:55.552
Thank you. Just such a big gesture.

34:55.636 --> 34:59.139
It was very unlike Gary, but what a ring.

34:59.223 --> 35:00.849
It's the most beautiful ring
I've ever seen in my life.

35:00.933 --> 35:02.476
Uh-huh.

35:02.559 --> 35:03.852
(chuckles):
Yeah.

35:03.936 --> 35:05.771
No, what about you?
How'd your proposal go?

35:05.854 --> 35:07.147
(clicks tongue)

35:07.231 --> 35:08.440
(exhales heavily)

35:08.524 --> 35:09.566
It didn't.

35:09.650 --> 35:11.151
Oh.

35:11.235 --> 35:13.529
But it will.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.615
(phone dings)

35:21.870 --> 35:23.038
Gary.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.458
Seems like he got caught up at work,

35:26.542 --> 35:28.377
so I don't think he's gonna be able
to make it, actually.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.715
But we could stay if you want.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.384
Sure, yeah.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.469
Sorry about that.

35:37.553 --> 35:41.098
Um, how did you and Gary meet?

35:41.181 --> 35:43.517
Actually, this.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.727
I wanted to get a tattoo of my mom's name,

35:45.811 --> 35:49.439
and a few friends recommended this
one shop, and he was the artist available.

35:49.523 --> 35:50.774
Which is so funny.

35:50.858 --> 35:54.570
I mean, I know it sounds kind of cheesy,

35:54.653 --> 35:56.905
but now sometimes I wonder if it was fate.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.408
Yeah. It's fun--

35:59.491 --> 36:00.534
-Weird.
-Mm-hmm.

36:00.617 --> 36:02.703
(stammers) Let me ask, uh--
Here's a good question.

36:02.786 --> 36:05.956
-Mm-hmm?
-Gary's a good guy, right?

36:06.039 --> 36:08.041
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

36:08.125 --> 36:10.627
Like... (stammers) like, would he, say,

36:10.711 --> 36:14.464
return fi-- a five-dollar bill
if someone dropped it?

36:14.548 --> 36:15.549
What?

36:15.632 --> 36:18.343
Yeah, no. That's-- Yeah. That is--

36:18.427 --> 36:21.805
Um, I was just trying to, you know,
g-get to know him a little.

36:21.889 --> 36:24.641
-(chuckles)
-How do I describe Gary?

36:24.725 --> 36:26.894
Gary is an artist.

36:26.977 --> 36:29.146
He's super talented.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.982
On the surface,
he can come across a little self-absorbed,

36:32.065 --> 36:34.401
but there's so much more to him.

36:34.484 --> 36:36.987
Nobody stood by me quite like him
when my first restaurant fell apart.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.780
He was amazing.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.365
I'm trying to think of what else.

36:40.449 --> 36:42.326
I mean, there's a lot to say. Uh...

36:42.409 --> 36:44.578
Oh! Another example.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.079
This bracelet was my mom's.

36:46.163 --> 36:47.789
I wear it everywhere.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.416
I do not know
what I would do if I lost it.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.418
It's very precious to me.
You get the point.

36:51.501 --> 36:54.880
I took the bracelet off when
I was in the chair getting my tattoo,

36:54.963 --> 36:57.049
and when I got home,
I realized I didn't have the bracelet.

36:57.132 --> 37:00.594
I panicked, I ran to the station,

37:00.677 --> 37:01.845
and there was Gary.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.224
He rode all the way out to Astoria.

37:06.308 --> 37:10.187
And I remember looking at him, being like,
"Wow, this is the kind of guy that he is."

37:10.270 --> 37:15.525
So if I ever-- well, when I get frustrated
that he's late or misses dinner

37:15.609 --> 37:20.614
or (laughs) is wrapped up in his own stuff
or always on his phone,

37:20.697 --> 37:24.451
I remember that he's the guy that went
eight subway stops out of his way for me

37:24.534 --> 37:25.869
when he didn't even know me.

37:25.953 --> 37:27.871
So, sorry. In the longest answer ever,

37:27.955 --> 37:30.248
yes, he is the kind of guy
who would return five dollars.

37:30.332 --> 37:31.959
(clicks tongue) Wow.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.127
You really do have a thing for bread.

37:34.211 --> 37:36.838
(laughs):
I do. Yeah. I'm sor-- Yeah.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.341
-Uh, number one fan.
-Numero uno.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.301
-Number one fan.
-That's you.

37:41.385 --> 37:43.512
DAISY: I can't believe
how they just move all together like that.

37:43.595 --> 37:47.557
I mean, the kids in my grade have a hard
time just getting into alphabetical order.

37:47.641 --> 37:50.310
Yeah, well, you know,
I was jealous that they were so flexible.

37:50.394 --> 37:54.064
I do Bar Method three times a week,
and I can barely touch my toes.

37:54.147 --> 37:56.066
-Brian?
-Vanessa.

37:56.149 --> 37:57.818
Hey, how are you?

37:57.901 --> 38:00.278
-Good. How are you?
-I'm good, good.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.363
Uh, I'm sorry.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.073
-This is my colleague David.
-Hey.

38:03.156 --> 38:05.492
David, this is Vanessa Randall.

38:05.575 --> 38:09.246
She was in-house PR for
the YA division before she abandoned us

38:09.329 --> 38:11.248
for the dark side-- L.A.

38:11.331 --> 38:12.582
-Ah.
-Well, you know,

38:12.666 --> 38:15.961
three years of slush and street garbage
was plenty for me.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.587
No argument there.

38:17.671 --> 38:20.090
-Uh, this is Daisy, Ethan's daughter.
-Hi.

38:20.173 --> 38:22.551
Brian actually introduced me to your dad.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.345
It's true. You know, he showed me
a picture of you the other day.

38:25.429 --> 38:28.140
Listen, I'm so excited Ethan came in.

38:28.223 --> 38:30.934
You know, I've been telling him for ages
to give it another shot.

38:31.018 --> 38:32.436
I bet it was your encouragement.

38:33.520 --> 38:39.109
Uh, I-I always encourage him,
but, you know, you know Ethan.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.111
He just needs to forge ahead.

38:41.194 --> 38:42.821
You know, none of us have
a crystal ball, right?

38:42.904 --> 38:45.407
-Yeah.
-We just got to do our best.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.867
Uh, good to see you.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.326
-You, too. Bye.
-Nice to meet you.

38:48.410 --> 38:50.078
-Bye.
-Bye.

38:52.205 --> 38:53.957
(sighs):
Okay.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.669
(groans) God.

38:57.753 --> 39:00.130
-And these are new.
-(laughing)

Taxi?

39:04.384 --> 39:06.303

Hey, T.

39:06.386 --> 39:09.264
Well, lookee lookee who it is.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.350
She's mad, huh?

39:13.602 --> 39:17.105
-Well, I came to surprise her.
-Mm.

39:17.189 --> 39:18.315
Got her these flowers.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.442
-Mm.
-Pretty nice, huh?

39:20.525 --> 39:22.569
Yeah, they're from the bodega.

39:22.652 --> 39:23.987
Uh, is she here?

39:24.071 --> 39:25.363
No.

39:25.447 --> 39:28.200
I actually haven't seen her
since she left to meet you.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.952
Mm.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.663
Mm-hmm.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.708
You know what I was thinking about
earlier today?

39:36.792 --> 39:38.710
-What?
-The book you're gonna write.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.879
Ah, well, I hope I write it.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.255
What do you mean, you hope?

39:42.339 --> 39:46.968
It's a lot of (sighs) procrastination
mixed in with self-loathing.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.678
I've got a great therapist.

39:48.762 --> 39:51.473
You just got to go for it.

39:51.556 --> 39:55.310
I can't wait to be walking by a bookstore
one day and see it in the window.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.313
-(laughs) I like that.

Ethan?

42:20.205 --> 42:22.082
I'll be in in a second.

42:23.708 --> 42:26.878
I-I called you. Where'd you go?

42:26.962 --> 42:29.130
(sighs) Sorry. I...

42:29.214 --> 42:32.008
My phone is MIA again.

42:32.092 --> 42:35.011
I-I need to put a damn tracker
on that thing.

42:35.095 --> 42:37.847
Is there something you need to tell me?

42:41.393 --> 42:43.770
Nothing that you need to worry about.

42:43.853 --> 42:45.105
Okay.

42:45.188 --> 42:48.984
I mean, you pushed hard for this trip.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.443
I changed my plans.

42:50.527 --> 42:55.740
I got on a flight for ten hours to be here
with you and Daisy 'cause you asked me to,

42:55.824 --> 43:00.245
and, you know, now I'm here
and you're not.

43:04.374 --> 43:05.625

43:07.627 --> 43:10.088

43:33.778 --> 43:35.822
I'm Ethan Greene.
I-- We haven't formally met.

43:35.905 --> 43:36.990
Oh, yeah.

43:37.073 --> 43:39.159
Um, you're the guy from the accident.

43:39.242 --> 43:42.203
-Yeah, I-I read the report.
-Yeah.

43:42.287 --> 43:44.664
Um, thank you so much
for what you did, man.

43:44.748 --> 43:46.499
It was nothing, man.

43:46.583 --> 43:49.336
Um... happy to help.

43:50.920 --> 43:54.674
How can I... help you? (chuckles)

43:54.758 --> 43:56.426
Um...

43:59.304 --> 44:01.681
So, I-I, you know, I think...

44:01.765 --> 44:04.059
I think we have something of each other's.

44:09.522 --> 44:15.028
Look, I have about a week's worth
to catch up on in here, so...

44:16.529 --> 44:18.907
...thank you again so much
for what you did...

44:18.990 --> 44:21.368
Okay. I want my ring back.

44:23.411 --> 44:24.412
(smacks lips)

44:24.496 --> 44:25.622
What ring?

44:25.705 --> 44:28.124
The ring that was supposed to be
on my girlfriend's hand right now,

44:28.208 --> 44:30.460
but I saw Rachel wearing it last night.

44:30.543 --> 44:32.796
You saw Rachel last night?

44:33.880 --> 44:35.548
Okay. You--

44:35.632 --> 44:39.803
Give me my ring back,
I'll give you your earrings back.

44:39.886 --> 44:41.513
No harm, no foul.

44:41.596 --> 44:43.181
Um...

44:46.393 --> 44:48.103
I don't know what you're talking about.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.687
Yes, you do.

44:49.771 --> 44:52.857
You can't be serious
about letting her keep it.

44:52.941 --> 44:54.025
Not telling her?

44:55.110 --> 44:57.737
Stay away from my fiancée.

I recently got... engaged.

-Mazel.
-Thank you very much.

46:28.286 --> 46:31.206
And I-I just--
I-I wanted to ask you, like,

46:31.289 --> 46:33.124
ab-about cleaning it, keeping it clean.

46:33.208 --> 46:35.960
I've never had anything quite this fancy,
so I don't want to mess it up.

46:36.044 --> 46:37.504
Very common question we get.

46:37.587 --> 46:39.547
I have a jewelry care kit that we sell.

46:39.631 --> 46:40.965
Would you be interested in one of these?

46:41.049 --> 46:43.092
Yes, that'd be perfect.
I bake a lot, and I just--

46:43.176 --> 46:45.053
you know, I don't want,
I don't want to ruin it. (chuckles)

46:45.136 --> 46:47.722
-I knew you'd say yes.
-What do you mean?

46:47.805 --> 46:50.475
-I never forget a ring I sell.
-You sold the ring?

46:50.558 --> 46:52.602
He made the right choice.
And it was a tough one.

46:52.685 --> 46:53.686
It was?

46:53.770 --> 46:56.731
-People around here say
I have a sixth sense. -(laughs)

46:56.814 --> 46:58.816
-About couples.
-Oh, okay.

46:58.900 --> 47:01.945
Anyway, seeing him,
I knew right then, that was the one.

47:03.029 --> 47:05.448
-You did?
-Congratulations again.

47:05.532 --> 47:07.158
To all three of you.

47:07.242 --> 47:09.327
To all three of us?

47:09.410 --> 47:11.496
Well, your fiancé's daughter.
She's quite a spitfire.

47:11.579 --> 47:14.415
-Oh, no, he doesn't have a...
-What was her name?

47:14.499 --> 47:17.126
I can almost think
it's like a flower-- Daisy.

47:17.210 --> 47:18.962
Daisy.

47:19.045 --> 47:21.089
Yeah, Daisy's the one
who picked that ring.

47:21.172 --> 47:23.925
We looked at the cushion cut,
the princess cut,

47:24.008 --> 47:26.177
-but that was the one for you.
-Um...

47:27.178 --> 47:30.473
Whoa. What about your care kit?

47:30.557 --> 47:33.685
-TERRI: Gary.
-T.

47:33.768 --> 47:35.436
What did you do?

47:35.520 --> 47:37.689
Uh, wh-what do you mean?

47:37.772 --> 47:41.234
Uh, I mean she's on
her third batch of rye.

47:41.317 --> 47:43.236
Well, it is a bread store.

47:43.319 --> 47:45.530
We don't need that much rye.

47:45.613 --> 47:47.824
That's her thinking bread.

47:47.907 --> 47:49.450
What did you do?

47:49.534 --> 47:51.619
I didn't do anything.

47:52.996 --> 47:54.581
-Today.
-Oh.

47:54.664 --> 47:56.583
Yeah.

47:56.666 --> 48:01.879
Gary, get your ass in that kitchen
and fix this, okay?

48:04.632 --> 48:05.717
GARY:
Hey, Rach.

48:08.177 --> 48:09.929
(Rachel sighs heavily)

48:11.889 --> 48:15.226
You got a little, uh... schmutz...

48:15.310 --> 48:16.519
Sorry.

48:16.603 --> 48:20.315
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

48:20.398 --> 48:22.108
A client came in late.

48:22.191 --> 48:24.027
And, I mean, you know how it is.

48:24.110 --> 48:26.237
I don't like to say no to the walk-ins.

48:27.447 --> 48:31.367
Part of that is because of you.

48:31.451 --> 48:33.494
'Cause of the New York Magazine article.

48:33.578 --> 48:35.830
Because you're the best.

48:37.832 --> 48:39.459
(sighs)

48:40.460 --> 48:42.462
How did you get the ring, Gary?

48:43.546 --> 48:44.672
What?

48:44.756 --> 48:46.674
It's...

48:46.758 --> 48:49.552
so extravagant, it's so beautiful,

48:49.636 --> 48:52.221
you know, I can't help but wonder,
how did you manage that?

48:54.015 --> 48:55.308
I mean, you did buy it, right?

48:58.144 --> 48:59.437
Gary?

49:00.521 --> 49:01.814
You know.

49:01.898 --> 49:04.025
Yeah, I know.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.443
How?

49:07.195 --> 49:08.946
That doesn't matter, Gary.

49:09.030 --> 49:11.783
Look, Rachel, I messed up.

49:11.866 --> 49:13.660
Yes, you messed up.

49:13.743 --> 49:16.329
But also... (sighs)

49:16.412 --> 49:17.955
Also, what?

49:18.039 --> 49:21.042
It's like when I wake up
in the middle of the night

49:21.125 --> 49:23.878
with some crazy idea for a tattoo.

49:23.961 --> 49:26.047
Once I sketch it, it becomes obvious.

49:26.130 --> 49:29.342
When I saw you open that ring box,

49:29.425 --> 49:32.762
it was the most obvious thing
I'd ever seen.

49:33.846 --> 49:35.431
What was your plan, though?

49:35.515 --> 49:39.185
What, were you gonna wait until we were
in a nursing home to tell me this story?

49:39.268 --> 49:40.687
What were you thinking?

49:40.770 --> 49:43.147
You gave me
somebody else's engagement ring.

49:43.231 --> 49:45.692
-That's crazy.
-I know. I know.

49:45.775 --> 49:48.194
It's crazy. I don't know what happened.

49:48.277 --> 49:50.613
I don't know what happened, Rachel.
I didn't have a plan.

49:50.697 --> 49:52.699
And then I saw that ring on your finger,

49:52.782 --> 49:57.537
and I realized this is the thing
I want the most in the entire world.

49:57.620 --> 50:00.623
(sighs) How could I give that back?

50:04.919 --> 50:07.380
What if there was no ring?

50:07.463 --> 50:09.507
What do you mean?

50:09.590 --> 50:11.134
I'm giving it back.

50:11.217 --> 50:13.302
So I'm asking you right now,
not half-concussed,

50:13.386 --> 50:16.931
no ring you have to hide behind, like...

50:17.014 --> 50:18.725
do you still want to marry me?

50:19.809 --> 50:21.769
Yes.

50:21.853 --> 50:24.021
Of course I want to marry you.

50:24.105 --> 50:26.983
I see a future with us.

50:27.066 --> 50:30.361
If you just give me one more chance,

50:30.445 --> 50:33.072
I will be so much better.

50:33.156 --> 50:34.323
I promise you.

50:34.407 --> 50:38.578
As a matter of fact, I think we should
celebrate the shit out of it. (chuckles)

50:38.661 --> 50:41.289
Let's have an engagement party.

50:41.372 --> 50:44.459
I mean, really. We should have
this huge New Year's party here.

50:44.542 --> 50:49.464
My cousin Finn will be in town,
and we can invite everybody that loves us.

50:49.547 --> 50:52.550
-(laughs)
-(sighs) Because I love you, Rachel.

50:54.719 --> 50:56.679
Remember to let me do all the talking.

50:56.763 --> 50:58.848
Why can't you just ask for the ring back?

50:58.931 --> 51:00.433
It's complicated, honey.

51:00.516 --> 51:04.979
Sometimes, when there's a mix-up, you
got to be careful of people's feelings.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.898
What about your feelings?

51:12.612 --> 51:14.197
East River.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.865
I feel like I should be
more surprised to see you.

51:15.948 --> 51:17.658
Hi, Terri.

51:17.742 --> 51:19.494
This is my daughter Daisy.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.287
Hi. Uh, my dad's gonna do all the talking.

51:22.371 --> 51:24.791
Don't worry, kid.
I don't know social cues yet either.

51:24.874 --> 51:27.877
You here to see Rachel? Again?

51:27.960 --> 51:30.087
Yeah, she-she texted me
and told me to come by.

51:30.171 --> 51:31.714
Oh, yeah, she's in the back.

51:31.798 --> 51:33.132
Dad, can I go say hi?

51:33.216 --> 51:35.009
Yeah, go ahead.
She's right around the corner.

51:42.225 --> 51:44.894
So, um...

51:44.977 --> 51:48.064
do you have something you want to tell me?

51:48.147 --> 51:50.316
Or...?

51:50.399 --> 51:52.318
You know?

51:52.401 --> 51:55.196
I know that something feels off,

51:55.279 --> 51:59.534
and I have a feeling that
you have something to do with it, so...

51:59.617 --> 52:01.285
I want to know what's going on.

52:01.369 --> 52:03.162
For Rachel.

52:06.332 --> 52:07.875
-Hi, Rachel.
-RACHEL: Hi, Daisy.

52:07.959 --> 52:09.836
-Hi.
-Is your dad out front?

52:09.919 --> 52:12.004
-Yep.
-Your dad's here?

52:12.088 --> 52:14.048
Are you making bread?

52:14.131 --> 52:15.258
Can I help?

52:15.341 --> 52:17.426
Of course you-- abs--
I need help. That'd be great.

52:17.510 --> 52:18.928
Um, do you want to grab an apron?

52:19.011 --> 52:20.471
-Yeah.
-Right there.

52:20.555 --> 52:23.391
-Can I talk to you for one sec over here?
-Yeah.

52:25.393 --> 52:28.229
What do you want me to do?
Want me to talk to him?

52:29.397 --> 52:31.482
-I'll handle it.
-Really?

52:33.526 --> 52:35.945
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

52:36.028 --> 52:38.281
-You're the best.
-Right.

52:38.364 --> 52:40.032
Well, I'll meet you
at the apartment later tonight.

52:40.116 --> 52:43.286
Maybe we can go over ideas
for New Year's Eve.

52:43.369 --> 52:44.787
-Yeah?
-Yeah. (laughs)

52:44.871 --> 52:46.956
-I love you so much.
-Okay.

52:48.332 --> 52:50.084
I promise I won't mess this up.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.461
Okay. Bye.

52:52.545 --> 52:54.547
I'm gonna sneak out back.

52:55.798 --> 52:57.466
(clicks tongue) All right.

52:57.550 --> 52:58.801
What?

52:58.885 --> 53:00.845
He got my ring, I got his present.

53:04.056 --> 53:06.851
Wow. That is way worse than I thought.

53:06.934 --> 53:09.770
And I-I tried to tell her the other night,
but I couldn't.

53:09.854 --> 53:11.439
I just...

53:13.065 --> 53:15.109
I didn't want to break her heart.

53:16.736 --> 53:18.404
RACHEL:
All right. Perfect.

53:18.487 --> 53:20.156
You can get your hands in there.

53:20.239 --> 53:21.908
Make a little mess.

53:23.075 --> 53:24.118
(both laugh)

53:24.201 --> 53:26.621
Yours is way better than mine, PS.

53:26.704 --> 53:27.788
(both laugh)

53:27.872 --> 53:29.624
DAISY:
So, how long does this take?

53:29.707 --> 53:31.709
Takes a while.

53:31.792 --> 53:35.838
Oh. What do you do
while waiting for it to be done?

53:35.922 --> 53:37.715
I don't know. That's a good question.

53:37.798 --> 53:40.801
What do I do while I wait--
I do a lot of thinking

53:40.885 --> 53:43.638
while I wait for my bread to bake.

53:43.721 --> 53:46.223
Well, I also spend a lot of time thinking.

53:50.394 --> 53:53.314
You know, when I was about your age,
I lost my mom, too.

53:55.316 --> 53:58.736
Do you like thinking about your mom,
or does it make you...

53:58.819 --> 54:00.529
make you kind of sad?

54:01.614 --> 54:04.116
-A little of both.
-Me, too.

54:04.200 --> 54:06.953
Can I teach you a little trick
that's helped me?

54:07.036 --> 54:09.330
-Okay.
-Okay, so you find one thing

54:09.413 --> 54:12.583
that you did with your mom
that was really special,

54:12.667 --> 54:15.836
and you make sure
to do that thing once every year.

54:15.920 --> 54:19.465
And at least for me,
it feels like she's right there with me.

54:19.548 --> 54:22.093
Mm. Do you have anything like that?

54:22.176 --> 54:26.138
Well, every year, on Christmas Eve,

54:26.222 --> 54:30.017
the three of us would pick out
these really ugly sweaters for each other.

54:30.101 --> 54:31.852
I mean, they were always so funny.

54:31.936 --> 54:34.313
But...

54:34.397 --> 54:38.109
we... haven't done it
since she's been gone.

54:38.192 --> 54:39.694
Uh, yeah.

54:39.777 --> 54:41.988
You can't stop doing it
'cause she's not here, though.

54:43.489 --> 54:45.825
You got to keep the tradition alive
because of her.

54:45.908 --> 54:48.035
-Right?
-Right.

54:48.119 --> 54:50.621
Your mom sounds like she was pretty cool.

54:52.581 --> 54:54.291
(softly):
She was.

54:58.629 --> 54:59.714
Hey.

55:01.424 --> 55:03.426
RACHEL:
Thank you so much for coming.

55:03.509 --> 55:06.721
Oh, yeah.
What, uh, what are y'all up to here?

55:06.804 --> 55:08.556
My God, it looks like I'm in heaven.

55:08.639 --> 55:12.018
(chuckles) Well, I'm helping make it.

55:12.101 --> 55:14.270
Yeah? You ask for a paycheck?

55:14.353 --> 55:16.814
Oops. I forgot. Sorry.

55:17.898 --> 55:20.359
Can I talk to Rachel for a little bit?

55:20.443 --> 55:22.695
Yeah. I'll invoice you, Rachel.

55:22.778 --> 55:24.238
(Rachel laughs)

55:24.321 --> 55:26.323
(Daisy chuckling)

55:28.159 --> 55:31.495
I will just cut right to the chase.

55:31.579 --> 55:32.997
I know about everything.

55:33.080 --> 55:36.959
And I know it's insane.
All of it is insane.

55:37.043 --> 55:40.296
(sighs)
I just wanted to say I am so sorry.

55:40.379 --> 55:41.672
No, I am.

55:41.756 --> 55:44.383
I-I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't.

55:44.467 --> 55:47.762
I just didn't think
it was my place to say anything.

55:47.845 --> 55:51.098
Thank you for being
exactly who you are through all of this.

55:52.308 --> 55:53.976
You're a really, really good person.

55:54.060 --> 55:57.146
I appreciate that.

55:57.229 --> 56:00.066
I just wanted to apologize myself.

56:00.149 --> 56:03.444
Gary's gonna reach out to you, obviously,

56:03.527 --> 56:05.821
give the ring back, and, um...

56:06.906 --> 56:08.866
...then we can all just move on.

56:15.372 --> 56:19.293
I, uh... I made this one special
for you all to share together.

56:26.092 --> 56:27.635
Thank you for this.

56:27.718 --> 56:29.178
Yeah.

56:32.765 --> 56:35.101

57:53.512 --> 57:54.930
Okay? Right?

57:55.014 --> 57:56.849
Like, what about you and Sophia?

57:56.932 --> 57:58.893
When you met her,
she was seeing somebody else.

57:58.976 --> 58:01.937
-That's not exactly a perf...
-That... No one's perfect.

58:02.021 --> 58:03.856
Hell, I used to have an eyebrow ring.

58:03.939 --> 58:06.192
Nobody's talking about that.

58:06.275 --> 58:07.818
Always bringing up old stuff.

58:09.486 --> 58:11.447
What about Ethan?

58:11.530 --> 58:14.867
Look, I know something when I see
something, and that wasn't nothing.

58:14.950 --> 58:17.119
He just wanted his ring back.

58:17.203 --> 58:18.287
That's it.

58:18.370 --> 58:21.290
-I deleted his number.
-(sighs)

58:21.373 --> 58:23.334
It was nothing.

58:23.417 --> 58:26.003
Look. Hey.

58:26.086 --> 58:28.464
Gary's not perfect either.

58:28.547 --> 58:31.425
I know that, but you don't turn your back
on somebody because they don't know

58:31.508 --> 58:34.887
how to tell you that a ring they could
never afford just ended up in their lap.

58:36.430 --> 58:39.016
He has some work to do. Who doesn't?

58:40.017 --> 58:43.312
I think you got to hold on to the good.

58:43.395 --> 58:48.776
And I think you got to love people
when you can,

58:48.859 --> 58:52.029
because there is no guarantee
that they'll be here tomorrow.

58:53.364 --> 58:54.490
You know?

58:55.574 --> 58:57.117
Well...

58:57.201 --> 59:00.162
does that mean that
I have to start being nice to him or...?

59:01.789 --> 59:06.418
(sighs) Terri, I think people would be
very confused if you did.

59:06.502 --> 59:08.837
I would be very confused if I did.

59:08.921 --> 59:10.297
(both laugh)

59:10.381 --> 59:12.549
Oh, hold up. Wait.

59:12.633 --> 59:14.301
What did you do with the ring?

59:16.845 --> 59:22.601
So, there I was, stranded in Brooklyn,
on a Zoom, trying to get a Lyft,

59:22.685 --> 59:24.478
but it was impossible
because it was rush hour.

59:24.561 --> 59:26.605
It was just horrible.

59:26.689 --> 59:31.402
Well, lucky for you, all the subways
will have Wi-Fi by the end of the year.

59:31.485 --> 59:34.405
There was a sign.
I was bored on the subway.

59:34.488 --> 59:35.739

59:35.823 --> 59:37.700
Uh, j-- um...

59:46.750 --> 59:47.918
-Remember?
-Yeah.

59:48.002 --> 59:49.920
Uh, and I got to help make the bread.

59:50.004 --> 59:52.381
Well, n-not this one,
but still, can we try it?

59:52.464 --> 59:53.465
Sure.

59:53.549 --> 59:55.301
-Yeah. Oh. Sorry.

59:55.384 --> 59:57.136
Oh, there's a warm piece.

59:57.219 --> 59:59.555
-That smells amazing. Okay.
-Make sure it's not poisoned.

59:59.638 --> 1:00:01.390
-My turn. Whoa.
-Wait, I wasn't done.

1:00:01.473 --> 1:00:04.101
-You got your piece. Come on.
-I was-- I wasn't, I wasn't done. I...

1:00:34.465 --> 1:00:36.800
This will never fit, but...

1:00:36.884 --> 1:00:38.844

Okay, now we're gonna have so many things
to do when we go back to L.A.

1:00:44.099 --> 1:00:46.018
You know, we'll have to look at venues.

1:00:46.101 --> 1:00:48.187
I'll make a list. Okay.

1:00:48.270 --> 1:00:50.105

Let's just focus on
everybody being happy right now.

-Exactly.

1:05:23.003 --> 1:05:25.088
It was three years ago. It was last week.

but it shouldn't be this hard.

Are you talking about mine?

but you did steal the ring.

-You cannot prove that.
