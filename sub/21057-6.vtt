00:36.439 --> 00:41.750
(The Lady in Dignity)

01:20.019 --> 01:21.250
Everyone should watch this.

01:21.849 --> 01:22.890
What is it?

01:24.019 --> 01:25.060
(Jin Hee)

01:34.599 --> 01:36.769
Father, there's something I have to tell you.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.739
I have something to tell you guys too.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.939
All of you are here,

01:42.109 --> 01:43.109
so this is perfect.

01:43.739 --> 01:45.579
Do you mind waiting upstairs with Ms. Jo?

01:45.680 --> 01:46.849
That's not necessary.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.480
I...

01:51.719 --> 01:53.390
have decided to marry her.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.450
- Dad! - Father.

01:56.719 --> 01:58.459
What are you talking about?

01:58.760 --> 02:00.430
Father, this is unacceptable.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.959
Father, you can't!

02:02.030 --> 02:03.859
You're not serious, are you?

02:03.959 --> 02:07.170
I want to get married and who are you to refuse?

02:07.829 --> 02:10.038
So, do you dare to stop me?

02:10.639 --> 02:14.139
Dad, you barely even know her.

02:14.340 --> 02:15.740
You can't take marriage lightly.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.180
Who says that I'm taking this lightly?

02:17.840 --> 02:18.879
You're disgraceful.

02:18.979 --> 02:22.110
Father, your marriage affects us too.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.580
Can't you all just shut it?

02:23.919 --> 02:25.680
Goodness, Mr. Chairman.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.090
Marriage is a big deal.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.759
It affects the others' lives.

02:31.289 --> 02:33.590
Instead of being angry at them,

02:33.659 --> 02:38.500
you should at least hear out what your family has to say.

02:44.639 --> 02:46.939
She'll take the place of our deceased mother-in-law.

02:47.409 --> 02:51.639
She'll be your wife, but she'll also be one of the elders in this house.

02:52.180 --> 02:54.110
You shouldn't make this decision alone.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.349
Moreover,

02:57.879 --> 03:00.550
we can't let someone who had been convicted of fraud...

03:00.550 --> 03:01.689
and embezzlement be part of this family.

03:02.389 --> 03:04.560
Fraud and embezzlement? Is that true?

03:05.090 --> 03:07.360
No way. He must be out of his mind.

03:07.430 --> 03:10.229
Her child had leukemia,

03:10.360 --> 03:11.930
so she embezzled money from her company.

03:13.030 --> 03:14.900
You all have children, don't you all?

03:15.030 --> 03:17.740
If Ji Hu or Un Gyu had such a terrible disease...

03:17.840 --> 03:21.439
and you had no money, wouldn't you steal for your own child?

03:21.939 --> 03:23.639
That's what any parent would do.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.509
You all have no sympathy.

03:31.550 --> 03:32.680
(Jin Hee)

03:40.030 --> 03:42.229
This is a video taken at your birthday party.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.330
Who is this?

03:46.060 --> 03:49.030
As you can see, someone made the canopy collapse.

03:50.469 --> 03:53.139
What happened that day was not a mere accident.

03:53.610 --> 03:54.939
It was intentional.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.849
We should think the marriage through.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.819
- And Father... - You should call the police.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.520
I also felt that something was fishy that day.

04:10.789 --> 04:14.030
When the canopy collapsed the way it did,

04:14.759 --> 04:18.259
I had a feeling that someone with bad intentions...

04:18.360 --> 04:20.800
was behind it all.

04:21.399 --> 04:25.300
So, you're saying that someone did that to hurt my dad?

04:26.399 --> 04:30.610
That's what I've been thinking, but I couldn't be sure.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.610
Now that we have...

04:33.680 --> 04:36.449
the video as proof,

04:37.180 --> 04:39.720
we should find out who the culprit is.

04:41.420 --> 04:45.490
After what happened, I knew that I had to protect Mr. Chairman.

04:45.759 --> 04:47.560
I was positive...

04:47.730 --> 04:51.899
that this house was dangerous for him to be alone.

04:52.029 --> 04:53.769
What are you suggesting?

04:54.029 --> 04:57.139
Are you implying that one of his children did this?

04:57.240 --> 04:59.839
Judging from the situation, it's possible.

05:00.269 --> 05:01.310
Shut your mouth!

05:03.480 --> 05:06.810
Or maybe it's not his children.

05:08.279 --> 05:09.449
What?

05:10.779 --> 05:14.149
How dare you speak like that to my future wife?

05:14.990 --> 05:17.290
There's no order in this place! Telling her to shut up and all.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.259
You have no shame.

05:21.490 --> 05:23.860
There is another video that's clearer.

05:27.699 --> 05:29.899
We should put the discussion about your marriage on hold.

05:30.170 --> 05:31.170
Why?

05:31.170 --> 05:34.370
We should find out who is behind this.

05:34.509 --> 05:35.540
Don't you want to know?

05:35.639 --> 05:37.410
What does that have to do with my marriage?

05:37.509 --> 05:38.810
Why does it not?

05:39.110 --> 05:40.949
She is one of the suspects.

05:42.980 --> 05:43.980
What?

05:44.550 --> 05:48.250
If she claims that one of our family members is a suspect,

05:49.120 --> 05:52.319
she can be a suspect too. Don't you think?

05:52.420 --> 05:53.459
That's right.

05:53.459 --> 05:55.329
Do you think she's crazy enough to do such a thing?

05:55.430 --> 05:58.629
After all, this was the incident that led you to want to marry her.

05:59.529 --> 06:02.829
If that was her motivation, it's possible.

06:04.670 --> 06:07.139
I'm disappointed in you.

06:07.269 --> 06:08.709
Tell me.

06:09.110 --> 06:11.209
Did you see this coming?

06:11.410 --> 06:12.740
See what coming?

06:13.550 --> 06:15.949
That you'll end up marrying Father.

06:17.379 --> 06:18.620
I had no idea.

06:19.319 --> 06:20.949
Is that so? I guess I am mistaken.

06:21.819 --> 06:23.660
It's such a shame that...

06:23.819 --> 06:27.629
all the evidence is pointing to you when you have no ulterior motive.

06:27.730 --> 06:30.800
If you don't want to be misunderstood,

06:30.800 --> 06:33.230
tell him that you won't marry him.

06:36.970 --> 06:38.399
I will always...

06:39.139 --> 06:41.339
protect Mr. Chairman.

06:41.439 --> 06:45.139
If marriage is what it takes,

06:46.439 --> 06:47.480
then I'll do it.

06:48.009 --> 06:51.779
You are already protecting him as a caregiver.

06:52.220 --> 06:55.589
Stop trying to be more than that.

06:56.220 --> 06:57.490
Don't cross the line.

06:57.589 --> 07:00.730
Father, she's the one who forced Un Gyu outside in the rain.

07:00.990 --> 07:03.930
Do you expect me to treat her as my mother-in-law?

07:04.029 --> 07:07.370
If you don't want to, take Un Gyu and leave this house!

07:07.430 --> 07:10.699
You shouldn't say that.

07:12.470 --> 07:15.139
Okay then. I'll leave.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.810
- Ju Mi. - Dad.

07:16.980 --> 07:19.639
Dad, do you like her more than your grandson?

07:19.740 --> 07:22.379
- How can you say that? - You stay out of this!

07:22.649 --> 07:25.819
I'll bite my tongue and kill myself.

07:26.319 --> 07:30.160
If you don't want an old man to get married, then I should just die.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.689
If I do,

07:32.990 --> 07:34.829
don't ever come to my funeral.

07:34.959 --> 07:37.129
I don't regard you as my children. Happy now?

07:46.439 --> 07:47.610
I'll leave.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.079
That will solve everything.

07:54.350 --> 07:55.610
Unbelievable.

08:09.889 --> 08:10.899
Wash up and sleep.

08:11.329 --> 08:13.800
Okay. Don't overthink it.

08:14.170 --> 08:16.000
They'll get married eventually.

08:16.629 --> 08:19.100
What? I can't believe you.

08:19.170 --> 08:22.670
If they do, there's nothing we can do to stop it.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.639
The problem is that she didn't end up here for no reason.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.680
She came here to seek something for herself.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.419
Goodness, Mr. Chairman.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.058
We don't have to do this.

08:39.690 --> 08:43.629
All I need is to be with you,

08:44.460 --> 08:45.629
that's all.

08:45.799 --> 08:46.929
Those brats.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.240
Who are they to refuse?

08:54.409 --> 08:55.639
Are you going to the second floor?

08:59.639 --> 09:00.980
I'll come back after I wash myself.

09:16.259 --> 09:17.460
I'm so cold.

09:17.899 --> 09:20.129
Go to sleep. I'm not in the mood.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.129
Okay.

09:38.179 --> 09:39.519
Wake up. You need to exercise.

09:41.019 --> 09:43.289
- Go on! - I don't need to go today.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.360
- Where are you going then? - We had a fight...

09:51.659 --> 09:54.299
Stop being weak. Act normally.

09:54.370 --> 09:55.500
Both you and I.

09:55.570 --> 09:57.970
We need to be strong to get through this.

09:58.070 --> 10:00.000
Just give up. Those two will get married.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.539
- What? - Not me. I'm talking about Dad.

10:02.610 --> 10:03.779
What are you talking about?

10:05.879 --> 10:08.450
This raspberry juice gives me energy.

10:08.710 --> 10:09.710
I'm going out to exercise!

10:26.899 --> 10:28.500
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

10:38.139 --> 10:41.009
The Pungsan woman settled for one million dollars.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.009
At least, she didn't have a child.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.950
One million dollars is too unfair.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.120
The amount is too small compared to his wealth.

10:48.220 --> 10:50.620
I heard she attempted suicide. Is she okay?

10:50.789 --> 10:52.259
I heard she lost her voice.

10:54.129 --> 10:56.799
A man really ruined a pretty girl's life.

10:57.330 --> 10:58.330
Yes.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.230
But I don't think the man is the only one to blame.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.370
It takes two for an affair.

11:05.470 --> 11:07.840
- The woman probably seduced him. - Probably.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.610
Is your husband doing all right?

11:13.110 --> 11:14.149
Yes.

11:15.710 --> 11:17.019
What about your husband?

11:17.480 --> 11:19.549
My husband is doing perfectly fine.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.289
I see.

11:23.320 --> 11:27.090
Every woman thinks that her husband never cheats on her.

11:27.460 --> 11:31.129
But it's the husbands of those women who cheat on them.

11:32.429 --> 11:33.570
I agree.

11:40.269 --> 11:43.169
A new salad restaurant opened up around the square. Let's go.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.240
Yes.

11:47.009 --> 11:48.679
Did you want to tell me something?

11:48.750 --> 11:51.019
Yes, I do.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.250
I guess that you're having a hard time because of the caregiver.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.960
It's worse than it seems. I can't find a solution to it.

12:00.129 --> 12:01.730
There is no solution.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.259
It's a never-ending fight between a parent and child.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.899
It would be easier to teach him a lesson only if he were a kid.

12:08.970 --> 12:11.899
I know that your father-in-law has you occupied,

12:12.070 --> 12:13.710
but pay attention to your husband.

12:15.370 --> 12:17.610
Normally, I would let things like this slide,

12:18.539 --> 12:20.379
but I think I should tell you...

12:21.149 --> 12:23.519
because you're special to me.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.580
Okay, I know.

12:27.850 --> 12:30.620
I think your husband is cheating on you.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.230
- You're here. - Did you finish your exercise?

12:44.299 --> 12:45.870
It's so refreshing.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.909
I didn't know cycling was such a good workout.

12:50.039 --> 12:52.279
You never miss a single day.

12:52.409 --> 12:53.450
Impressive!

12:55.309 --> 12:56.379
Yes.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.690
He bought the medicine and said it's not for you.

13:00.789 --> 13:03.820
I see what's going on. You're mistaken.

13:03.990 --> 13:06.730
He rides his bike every day, so he probably bought that medicine...

13:06.889 --> 13:08.289
for his own health.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.200
The medicine isn't for health improvement.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.000
He takes all kinds of supplements and tonics.

13:14.269 --> 13:16.429
He's under a lot of stress because of the new product launch.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.740
He likes food that increases his stamina.

13:20.570 --> 13:22.240
- Is that so? - Of course.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.440
My gosh.

13:23.809 --> 13:25.480
Even if he did, there's no way...

13:25.580 --> 13:27.710
that he would tell Dr. Jang that he's cheating.

13:27.779 --> 13:29.080
You're wrong.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.750
Men do share things like that with each other.

13:31.820 --> 13:33.649
They know each other through the kids' gatherings.

13:33.789 --> 13:37.159
He'll know that telling Dr. Jang will eventually reveal his secrets.

13:37.620 --> 13:39.889
He says ridiculous things like that often.

13:39.990 --> 13:42.690
Sometimes, it's hard to tell if it's a joke or a lie.

13:43.730 --> 13:45.360
Then, there's nothing to worry about.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.000
Still, you should keep an eye on him.

13:50.169 --> 13:52.070
I wish that you're right.

13:54.110 --> 13:57.340
What about your husband?

13:57.639 --> 13:58.639
What about him?

13:59.509 --> 14:01.750
I'm just wondering.

14:02.250 --> 14:05.850
He's so handsome and fine that he attracts a lot of pretty girls.

14:06.350 --> 14:07.620
That's very true.

14:07.919 --> 14:09.919
Doesn't he get handsome as he gets older?

14:10.360 --> 14:11.860
He's still very loyal to me.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.960
Yesterday,

14:16.230 --> 14:17.460
he kept on going.

14:20.629 --> 14:21.669
I see.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.169
Good for you.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.210
It stinks.

14:28.470 --> 14:31.080
What is this smell?

14:36.009 --> 14:37.850
Why did he have to say such things?

14:38.679 --> 14:40.190
He doesn't think when he talks.

14:51.159 --> 14:54.600
I'm planning on making pickles for Ji Hu since we ran out of them.

14:54.669 --> 14:55.669
Okay.

14:56.370 --> 14:58.840
How long has it been since your husband started cycling?

14:59.139 --> 15:01.539
I don't know. It's been a while I guess.

15:01.669 --> 15:04.840
Well, he never went riding on one until today.

15:05.639 --> 15:08.549
- What? - He hasn't been cycling.

15:09.350 --> 15:10.919
Keep a watchful eye on him.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.799
(Mr. Yun)

15:31.470 --> 15:33.039
(Turn Off)

15:34.909 --> 15:37.279
Am I working alone here?

15:37.340 --> 15:39.340
The number you have dialed is switched off...

15:47.750 --> 15:50.220
I always thought that it was strange...

15:50.419 --> 15:54.559
how his clothes wouldn't smell of sweat. But today, his clothes stank.

15:55.429 --> 15:57.960
That means that he never...

15:58.159 --> 16:00.269
went cycling until today.

16:00.870 --> 16:03.269
I saw your husband at Take Two in Cheongdam-dong yesterday.

16:03.370 --> 16:04.370
He was with a woman.

16:04.440 --> 16:07.309
Oh, I heard that you had food with a young girl at a café.

16:07.409 --> 16:08.470
I caught you red-handed!

16:09.370 --> 16:10.379
What?

16:23.659 --> 16:24.690
How are you, partner?

16:27.559 --> 16:29.590
Hi, partner.

16:31.559 --> 16:33.029
I'm not good at all.

16:43.610 --> 16:48.409
Goodness. Don't be too disappointed. You're too obsessing over it.

16:48.679 --> 16:49.850
Those brats.

16:50.419 --> 16:51.980
They are useless.

16:53.149 --> 16:54.820
Let's get married by ourselves.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.889
Maybe you'll get a child...

16:58.159 --> 17:02.029
who is not like them.

17:08.868 --> 17:09.900
Mr. Chairman.

17:11.339 --> 17:13.839
I want to have your baby.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.650
Father, she's the woman who forced Un Gyu outside in the rain.

17:22.950 --> 17:25.920
Do you expect me to treat her as my mother-in-law?

17:25.980 --> 17:29.390
If you don't want to, take Un Gyu and leave this house!

17:40.970 --> 17:42.400
(Account Balance)

17:55.950 --> 17:57.880
She got pregnant against her will.

17:58.519 --> 17:59.880
It was clearly a case of rape.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.049
I understand that they can't find out...

18:03.119 --> 18:04.759
who the rapist is.

18:04.890 --> 18:08.630
But expecting me to pay for the hotel fees is absurd.

18:08.730 --> 18:11.299
Of course. It is absurd.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.500
The contract says that the hotel...

18:14.599 --> 18:18.099
must protect the dog from any harm.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.640
But she got pregnant,

18:22.009 --> 18:23.880
so I will sue the hotel...

18:23.980 --> 18:25.980
and I refuse to pay the hotel fees.

18:26.039 --> 18:29.380
It is possible to sue the pet hotel,

18:29.950 --> 18:33.750
but are you sure that she got pregnant there?

18:34.089 --> 18:37.759
Are you saying that she's a whore?

18:38.390 --> 18:39.559
That's not what I mean,

18:40.329 --> 18:44.160
but since the hotel says that no such thing happened...

19:12.960 --> 19:15.160
How is it going with the caregiver?

19:23.640 --> 19:26.599
She is about to be my mother-in-law.

19:26.769 --> 19:29.839
Going mental. Emergency situation. Depressed.

19:33.950 --> 19:36.920
How much can you give me for all this?

19:42.289 --> 19:43.289
Never mind.

19:43.589 --> 19:44.619
Leave it.

20:03.140 --> 20:05.210
How long will it take?

20:06.509 --> 20:09.809
We can do everything, but we don't make Korean ramp pickles.

20:09.950 --> 20:13.250
Angelica and cedrela pickles are our specialties.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.089
Make Korean ramp pickles.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.119
Mr. Chairman would like them.

20:18.220 --> 20:20.089
I told you we don't make them.

20:22.460 --> 20:25.829
You run this place illegally, don't you?

20:28.470 --> 20:31.099
You certainly are not paying any taxes.

20:33.140 --> 20:34.910
To make someone side with you,

20:35.140 --> 20:37.480
rather than persuasion or appeasement,

20:37.809 --> 20:41.109
acting upon their weakness is a powerful strategy.

20:44.279 --> 20:48.619
Everyone has secrets and weaknesses,

20:50.660 --> 20:55.430
which are only to be revealed...

20:55.759 --> 20:59.359
by someone who will take advantage of it.

21:04.670 --> 21:06.809
He's in a good mood.

21:08.970 --> 21:10.180
He's buying her a car.

21:15.079 --> 21:16.450
I'll try all of these on.

21:17.180 --> 21:19.079
Okay. I'll get them ready for you.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.990
You have one just like that. Are you buying another one?

21:30.430 --> 21:33.099
Dad. I like this car the most.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.329
- This car suits you best. - Really?

21:37.240 --> 21:39.539
That will be 8,320 dollars.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.650
Goodbye.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.849
Goodbye.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.650
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

22:02.390 --> 22:05.299
You should greet them back.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.130
Don't you have manners?

22:08.630 --> 22:10.240
I guess I don't.

22:12.099 --> 22:15.269
Look who's talking!

22:15.440 --> 22:17.640
- Have you gone mad? - Watch what you say.

22:17.839 --> 22:19.339
If I don't have manners,

22:20.549 --> 22:21.980
neither do you.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.250
Wench.

22:24.180 --> 22:26.019
Hey. Are you crazy?

22:29.890 --> 22:32.220
- Jerk. - What?

22:33.930 --> 22:36.359
Hey. Get out.

22:36.630 --> 22:38.960
Get home and take a beating.

22:39.599 --> 22:40.900
- No. - You need a beating.

22:41.230 --> 22:42.269
Come.

22:45.099 --> 22:46.140
Come.

22:49.839 --> 22:52.339
Do you want to meet tonight? Don't you miss me?

22:52.809 --> 22:55.180
Come to my room.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.819
I feel insecure in other locations.

22:57.650 --> 22:59.650
Okay. See you then.

23:01.420 --> 23:04.190
What was that? That sounds like you're talking to a man.

23:04.319 --> 23:05.319
That's right.

23:06.319 --> 23:08.990
I was right. Is that who I think it is?

23:09.559 --> 23:12.359
- Yes. - Way to go.

23:12.430 --> 23:13.730
He's so young.

23:13.869 --> 23:16.599
I live with an old man, so my lover should be a young one.

23:17.269 --> 23:18.640
- Don't you think so? - Of course.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.940
Just like how we like new cars.

23:21.339 --> 23:22.940
Be careful not to get caught.

23:24.809 --> 23:26.880
She says that her husband isn't cheating.

23:28.109 --> 23:29.109
Is that true?

23:29.880 --> 23:33.549
I guess it was just a rumor.

23:34.319 --> 23:36.690
He doesn't seem like a guy who would cheat on his wife.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.559
You should look out for your husband too.

23:42.259 --> 23:44.299
No man should ever be trusted in this world.

23:44.630 --> 23:47.000
Especially...

23:47.569 --> 23:48.829
the husbands.

23:55.670 --> 23:58.380
I said that there's another video.

23:59.039 --> 24:01.650
Then? Was she shocked?

24:02.150 --> 24:03.180
Yes.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.579
She definitely seemed a little shocked.

24:06.519 --> 24:08.519
But we don't have another video. What do we do?

24:11.019 --> 24:12.789
Now I know the feeling of detectives...

24:12.890 --> 24:16.029
who know who the suspect is, but doesn't have proof.

24:19.430 --> 24:23.130
This morning, a friend told me that my husband is cheating.

24:23.269 --> 24:27.069
The housekeeper told me she thinks he doesn't go cycling every morning.

24:29.309 --> 24:30.809
When you put that together,

24:30.880 --> 24:33.180
that means your husband is cheating on you in the morning.

24:41.589 --> 24:42.650
No way.

25:04.009 --> 25:06.809
This is coming off. It's not sticky enough.

25:07.049 --> 25:11.349
People normally don't wear this upside down and shake around.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.819
That's true.

25:15.890 --> 25:16.920
Yes?

25:22.089 --> 25:23.089
I'll leave.

25:23.460 --> 25:26.430
You must have urgent matters.

25:26.630 --> 25:27.630
Yes.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.049
You don't answer my calls.

25:48.049 --> 25:49.049
Why did you call?

25:49.720 --> 25:53.220
- I am sorry about yesterday. - Go away. I have nothing to say.

25:54.059 --> 25:55.559
- Sorry. - Hey.

25:56.630 --> 25:58.299
There's something you need to know.

25:58.559 --> 26:01.299
I'm not insanely in love with you.

26:01.670 --> 26:05.000
If you pull something like that off again, it's goodbye.

26:07.670 --> 26:08.670
Am I...

26:10.009 --> 26:13.180
just a hookup to you?

26:14.509 --> 26:17.279
Give me money then. At least, I'll get something out of it.

26:17.849 --> 26:19.380
Then, I'll get over you.

26:20.490 --> 26:22.119
What kind of person do you think I am?

26:22.220 --> 26:24.819
You were my love and destiny.

26:27.329 --> 26:28.390
Me too.

26:30.230 --> 26:31.259
Who said you weren't?

26:31.900 --> 26:34.029
Let stop seeing each other for a while.

26:34.529 --> 26:36.369
I don't think we're in the same emotional page.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.109
Ma'am.

26:44.980 --> 26:47.809
Hello, Manager Park. You must have a lot of work these days.

26:48.450 --> 26:50.950
It's the same as usual.

26:51.019 --> 26:53.450
- Is he inside? - He's with a visitor right now,

26:53.519 --> 26:55.250
I'll go and tell him.

26:55.720 --> 26:58.589
I think he was...

26:58.859 --> 27:00.660
in a serious discussion.

27:01.690 --> 27:02.690
Okay then.

27:17.380 --> 27:19.740
Ms. Woo is here now!

27:21.210 --> 27:24.480
Hide. Go under the sofa.

27:24.579 --> 27:25.579
- Wait. - Hurry!

27:25.980 --> 27:27.450
Get underneath.

27:28.190 --> 27:30.690
Why won't this open?

27:31.019 --> 27:33.119
- Where did she go? - Desk!

27:33.190 --> 27:34.559
All right. Hurry. Go!

27:44.099 --> 27:45.940
The guest has left.

27:46.869 --> 27:48.609
- You can come in, ma'am. - Okay.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.410
This...

27:57.579 --> 27:59.380
(Office of Executive Director)

28:02.720 --> 28:04.460
Welcome. What's the matter?

28:04.690 --> 28:06.119
I want to have lunch with you.

28:06.289 --> 28:08.160
Lunch sounds great! Very good!

28:09.589 --> 28:11.099
Why are you in such a good mood?

28:12.500 --> 28:15.369
Because you are here,

28:15.799 --> 28:16.970
of course.

28:30.420 --> 28:32.920
Do you want to stay outside until I wrap things up?

28:33.019 --> 28:35.049
Why? I can just wait here.

28:35.190 --> 28:36.220
Really?

28:37.819 --> 28:38.960
You can indeed.

28:40.089 --> 28:41.329
I thought you were going to finish.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.730
I'm starving. Let's go.

28:45.059 --> 28:46.259
Let's go.

28:46.329 --> 28:48.599
- What do you want to eat? - I...

28:48.799 --> 28:51.470
I'll buy you something delicious.

28:54.869 --> 28:57.140
Mr. Park, I'll come back after lunch.

28:57.309 --> 28:58.339
Okay.

28:59.509 --> 29:02.809
And as for the adhesion, I think it is good enough.

29:02.950 --> 29:05.150
If we make it stickier, it would be too sticky.

29:08.619 --> 29:10.519
Have a nice lunch.

29:28.069 --> 29:30.910
Mr. Chairman, you're walking fine.

29:32.440 --> 29:35.109
You'll soon be running around.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.549
I'm doing well, right?

29:40.390 --> 29:41.450
Astonishingly well.

29:42.890 --> 29:46.359
We should call it a day. Let's go.

29:47.230 --> 29:48.490
What a joke.

29:49.430 --> 29:50.460
Good for you.

29:52.599 --> 29:53.670
This is spicy.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.240
Did you get medicine from Dr. Jang?

29:57.569 --> 29:58.670
What?

29:59.670 --> 30:00.740
What kind of medicine?

30:02.440 --> 30:03.509
Do you mean Balporin?

30:03.509 --> 30:05.579
Seeing you surprised makes me suspicious.

30:05.779 --> 30:07.349
Why did you ask for such medicine?

30:08.079 --> 30:10.279
Dr. Jang recommended it to me.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.450
You know how much I like medicine. That's why I tried...

30:12.519 --> 30:15.019
Then, why do people around Dr. Jang...

30:15.119 --> 30:18.190
think that you are cheating?

30:18.319 --> 30:20.460
And why are people telling me this?

30:20.660 --> 30:23.329
What have you been up to?

30:23.500 --> 30:25.200
I was just a joke.

30:25.599 --> 30:27.869
I shouldn't hang out with people who don't have a sense of humor.

30:27.970 --> 30:30.569
You shouldn't joke around with stuff like that.

30:30.670 --> 30:33.740
I'm sorry. You must have been worried.

30:34.069 --> 30:35.970
Not worried. Just embarrassed.

30:36.069 --> 30:39.210
Even if I did cheat, how could I tell people something like that?

30:39.410 --> 30:42.279
You're certainly capable of doing so. You're out of control at times.

30:43.009 --> 30:46.619
A Jin, I have only one woman in my world and that's you.

30:47.089 --> 30:48.349
Are there two suns in this world?

30:48.490 --> 30:52.160
There's only one sun in this world.

30:52.319 --> 30:54.859
You're my sunshine, all right?

30:55.190 --> 30:56.190
What's with you?

30:56.490 --> 30:57.859
From now on,

30:58.200 --> 31:01.269
I'll buy medicine from a certified pharmacy.

31:01.369 --> 31:03.670
You're out of control again. Are you joking again?

31:03.740 --> 31:07.309
Okay. I'll behave from now on.

31:07.539 --> 31:10.039
- Don't embarrass Ji Hu. - Okay, ma'am.

31:18.079 --> 31:20.519
Should I just live here?

31:21.319 --> 31:22.349
Go home now!

31:22.519 --> 31:24.289
I can't. I won't!

31:25.420 --> 31:26.990
Promise me your inheritance, and I will.

31:27.059 --> 31:28.289
This brat...

31:28.359 --> 31:31.400
Dad, I need money.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.970
My husband lost it all.

31:34.329 --> 31:36.500
If I want to divorce and go my own way...

31:36.569 --> 31:38.940
Enough! I won't give you a penny!

31:39.039 --> 31:42.309
Money should go to those who can take care of it.

31:42.509 --> 31:43.779
It isn't worth anything...

31:43.940 --> 31:46.079
to those who waste it like you.

31:46.309 --> 31:47.480
I won't give you a penny.

31:47.950 --> 31:49.849
What? Did you say, "anything"?

32:02.359 --> 32:04.460
If she gets married,

32:05.059 --> 32:06.900
I'd have to call her "Ma'am," right?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.500
Then, Ms. Woo would have to call her "Mother."

32:11.940 --> 32:14.309
They say that you never know what tomorrow may bring.

32:14.569 --> 32:16.710
What if she really marries the chairman of Daesung Pulp?

32:17.210 --> 32:18.480
That could be.

32:18.910 --> 32:21.609
- Is there a way to stop it? - No.

32:23.779 --> 32:24.779
Thank you.

32:25.319 --> 32:26.579
How old was she again?

32:27.319 --> 32:30.259
6 years younger than me. So, she's 45 years old.

32:30.859 --> 32:34.789
Then, she's probably fertile. What if she gets pregnant?

32:35.190 --> 32:36.359
No way.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.799
Can Mr. Chairman...

32:40.470 --> 32:42.730
He probably could. That's probably why he's getting married.

32:43.839 --> 32:45.240
I don't think he could.

32:47.170 --> 32:48.509
It's already up.

34:01.109 --> 34:02.150
What?

34:12.690 --> 34:15.989
You've been recording a video of me eating, right? Stop it already.

34:22.570 --> 34:24.699
I saw someone lurking around our house.

34:24.940 --> 34:27.110
I wondered who it was at first, then remembered...

34:27.170 --> 34:29.170
it was the man from the video sent by A Jin.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.909
How kind of him to walk...

34:33.179 --> 34:36.150
in front of the security camera, right?

34:37.380 --> 34:39.250
I should call the security services right away.

34:53.199 --> 34:56.230
Hey. What were you doing, you idiot?

34:56.530 --> 34:58.300
Why didn't you answer my calls?

35:00.469 --> 35:02.469
I told you not to call me.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.239
This is an untraceable phone.

35:05.739 --> 35:09.750
I told you no calls or texts are allowed.

35:09.909 --> 35:11.349
I heard that there was another video.

35:12.519 --> 35:14.050
It's been keeping me on edge.

35:14.190 --> 35:17.889
Is that why you revealed your face to the security camera, you idiot?

35:19.489 --> 35:22.730
If you get caught, tell them.

35:23.860 --> 35:24.900
What?

35:25.260 --> 35:27.869
- That Ms. Park told you to do it. - What?

35:28.230 --> 35:30.940
If you do, I'll give you that fitness center you wanted.

35:31.239 --> 35:32.469
That's not fair.

35:32.639 --> 35:34.809
Do you want to tell them that I did it?

35:34.909 --> 35:37.679
Then, we both go down.

35:37.780 --> 35:40.150
Tell them that it was Ms. Park. They will stop the investigation.

35:40.250 --> 35:42.179
Use your brain, you punk.

35:42.949 --> 35:45.449
This will end by simply making her leave the house.

35:48.289 --> 35:51.519
And get rid of that phone right away.

35:52.219 --> 35:55.260
If there are records that we spoke on the phone, we'll be done for.

36:01.070 --> 36:03.070
That's him. The man in the video.

36:03.699 --> 36:05.570
Can you focus on his face?

36:06.099 --> 36:07.170
Yes.

36:16.150 --> 36:17.550
Do you know him?

36:18.119 --> 36:20.849
No, but he does look familiar.

36:27.030 --> 36:28.329
I can't remember where I saw him.

36:39.940 --> 36:41.039
You draw well.

36:42.639 --> 36:43.980
(Jae Seok)

36:45.880 --> 36:46.909
Hello?

36:47.780 --> 36:48.849
Why did you call?

36:49.780 --> 36:50.849
I'm not interested.

36:53.179 --> 36:55.050
I am teaching your daughter how to draw. Why?

36:57.090 --> 36:58.760
You don't need to come. We're not at home.

37:05.260 --> 37:08.030
Ji Hu. I know you're very good, but look.

37:08.130 --> 37:09.929
The basics of drawing a landscape are trees.

37:10.039 --> 37:12.099
The ratio should be three to two.

37:12.170 --> 37:15.809
So, if you divide it into 5 areas, make the ratio 3 to 2.

37:15.969 --> 37:18.340
Color it with bright and light colors as a base color...

37:19.909 --> 37:22.010
Why? Is there something on my face?

37:22.380 --> 37:24.519
Who was on the phone just now?

37:25.679 --> 37:26.849
Why?

37:27.050 --> 37:29.420
Because you seem happy all of a sudden.

37:31.289 --> 37:33.289
3 to 2...

37:49.940 --> 37:52.340
(Jae Seok)

38:08.960 --> 38:12.500
1 for your father-in-law's and 1 for your house. I bought 2.

38:14.130 --> 38:17.699
Ji Hu is in art class. I'll bring her home after she finishes.

38:21.969 --> 38:24.239
- You're here. - Yes. You seem busy.

38:25.510 --> 38:26.510
Hey.

38:26.980 --> 38:29.650
I'll be waiting on that bench.

38:34.289 --> 38:37.289
You can color it, can you? If you want to make it brighter,

38:37.389 --> 38:40.489
just use more water instead of white paint. Okay?

38:53.469 --> 38:55.809
Why are you painting outside in the cold?

38:55.869 --> 38:59.480
You can paint inside with two apples on a table.

39:00.780 --> 39:02.550
Are you still angry at me?

39:02.980 --> 39:05.550
I told you that I'm sorry.

39:08.550 --> 39:09.789
There's a camel!

39:12.690 --> 39:13.690
It's not funny?

39:15.559 --> 39:17.760
There is a monkey too!

39:21.000 --> 39:22.829
Is that funny to you?

39:43.389 --> 39:45.360
What's that?

39:51.400 --> 39:53.869
An unpredictable future is worrisome.

39:58.869 --> 40:01.110
You don't know what you will discover.

40:09.349 --> 40:11.380
You don't know what will happen.

40:15.849 --> 40:17.889
(Your husband is seeing another woman.)

40:20.389 --> 40:22.989
You don't know what is real or fake.

40:26.230 --> 40:27.929
(Diagnosis Oh Gyeong Hui)

40:28.030 --> 40:30.800
(Bruising of face and chest, Spraining of spine)

40:34.909 --> 40:36.610
You don't know what you will end up doing...

40:37.239 --> 40:39.409
at that time.

41:23.489 --> 41:25.590
As you come up, stretch!

41:30.300 --> 41:31.360
Hello?

41:31.360 --> 41:34.670
Jin Hee, I found out who that man in the video is.

41:35.329 --> 41:36.500
I found out who he is.

41:37.139 --> 41:38.170
I'll talk to you later.

42:00.989 --> 42:03.130
Ji Hu, aren't you listening to music?

42:06.829 --> 42:08.500
Why are you staring at me like that?

42:08.769 --> 42:10.000
Dad, are you cheating on Mom?

42:19.610 --> 42:22.480
(Seoul Gangnam Police Station)

42:24.250 --> 42:26.019
Who beat you up like that?

42:28.119 --> 42:31.719
Someone came from the shop and did this.

42:33.159 --> 42:37.000
He could be the same person who attacked your husband.

42:37.159 --> 42:38.199
Yes.

42:38.559 --> 42:42.800
But why didn't he attack you the same?

42:44.039 --> 42:46.769
I screamed and he fled.

42:48.369 --> 42:50.610
There are security cameras everywhere these days.

42:51.139 --> 42:53.449
I'm sure we can find him easily.

42:53.610 --> 42:56.980
There were no security cameras in the area where I was attacked.

42:57.679 --> 42:58.679
Pardon?

42:58.679 --> 43:01.449
Don't you think I'd know that already?

43:12.130 --> 43:13.159
Hello.

43:13.929 --> 43:15.000
Hello.

43:15.300 --> 43:16.329
Let's talk.

43:17.739 --> 43:18.769
Okay.

43:23.070 --> 43:25.780
(Police)

44:04.750 --> 44:06.989
Let's take a look at the security camera footage of this morning.

44:07.449 --> 44:09.449
The police already took it, ma'am.

44:09.519 --> 44:11.989
No, not that one.

44:12.460 --> 44:14.130
The one in the elevator.

44:18.699 --> 44:22.030
I need the video of the person who attacked me.

44:28.010 --> 44:30.409
Don't show this to the police.

44:31.239 --> 44:32.809
I will keep this for myself.

44:34.880 --> 44:38.019
It will only distract them from the investigation.

44:44.920 --> 44:46.219
Have a drink.

44:46.690 --> 44:50.360
(Administration Office)

44:55.300 --> 44:57.000
- Are you all right? - Yes.

44:57.539 --> 44:59.039
Who did it?

45:00.440 --> 45:01.739
Wasn't it you?

45:02.610 --> 45:03.610
Why would I do such a thing?

45:03.679 --> 45:06.380
You told me that you would kill him...

45:06.480 --> 45:07.880
if he lays a hand on me.

45:08.679 --> 45:11.079
Yes, but it wasn't me.

45:12.250 --> 45:13.920
So, it wasn't you.

45:16.449 --> 45:19.219
That jerk must have a lot of enemies.

45:20.130 --> 45:21.260
Good.

45:21.860 --> 45:23.130
Let's go.

45:24.800 --> 45:27.429
I don't want to go home today.

45:35.039 --> 45:36.369
It was me, ma'am.

45:37.679 --> 45:39.679
I was so worried that I visited the place.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.349
Sorry.

45:45.219 --> 45:48.219
- You should be totally honest. - Of course.

45:49.090 --> 45:50.119
I will not lie.

45:50.690 --> 45:52.960
- Who told you to do it? - Park Bok Ja.

45:55.090 --> 45:57.429
She wanted Park Bok Ja to leave the house.

45:58.530 --> 45:59.929
She despised her.

46:00.400 --> 46:02.670
- Who did? - The wife of the oldest son.

46:03.670 --> 46:04.699
The professor.

46:08.840 --> 46:09.869
So,

46:11.409 --> 46:14.550
you're saying that Ju Mi told you to do this?

46:15.079 --> 46:16.079
Yes.

46:16.880 --> 46:21.019
She wanted me to hurt Park Bok Ja, not Mr. Chairman.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.489
Do you expect me to believe you?

46:25.619 --> 46:28.130
She had much hatred towards Park Bok Ja.

46:28.230 --> 46:29.260
She even...

46:31.329 --> 46:33.599
told me that she wanted her dead.

46:35.429 --> 46:36.800
How do you know Ju Mi?

46:36.969 --> 46:40.369
She came by one time because of Mr. Chairman's therapy.

46:42.369 --> 46:43.380
That's true.

46:44.239 --> 46:46.179
She came by during vacation.

46:49.079 --> 46:50.380
Sorry, ma'am.

46:51.750 --> 46:53.320
I urgently needed money.

46:54.019 --> 46:55.050
She told me...

46:56.289 --> 46:58.719
to take this secret to the grave.

47:00.059 --> 47:01.429
I am terribly sorry.

47:06.929 --> 47:08.869
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

47:09.800 --> 47:11.340
Ji Hu, let's eat.

47:14.269 --> 47:17.610
The art teacher helps me with my work.

47:18.039 --> 47:21.679
That's why we've become close, but it's nothing inappropriate.

47:22.380 --> 47:24.650
Dad. Have you read Hansel and Gretel?

47:24.750 --> 47:26.820
I think so, but I don't remember.

47:26.920 --> 47:29.949
Do you think that their stepmother abandoned them?

47:30.059 --> 47:33.730
No. The real bad person is their dad.

47:34.130 --> 47:37.829
The stepmother tells him to abandon his children, so he does.

47:38.130 --> 47:40.000
He's a really bad person.

47:40.429 --> 47:42.929
But I bet he wasn't originally a bad person.

47:43.329 --> 47:45.300
The stepmother made him like that.

47:45.670 --> 47:48.170
Men in fairytales are seduced...

47:48.610 --> 47:52.179
not by good women, but by evil women.

47:52.539 --> 47:54.309
Same happened to Cinderella's dad.

47:54.650 --> 47:58.579
Ji Hu, I am totally different from those assholes.

47:58.750 --> 48:02.449
- Dad is... - I will not forgive anyone...

48:02.690 --> 48:04.420
who breaks Mom's heart.

48:04.960 --> 48:06.289
Even if it is you.

48:21.969 --> 48:23.110
I love you, Dad.

48:26.340 --> 48:27.349
Me too.

48:54.840 --> 48:57.440
- Yes, Ju Mi. - A Jin, how did it go?

48:57.909 --> 48:59.010
Did you find out who it was?

49:00.909 --> 49:01.949
About that...

49:03.449 --> 49:06.150
- No, I have no idea. - Then, you should call the police.

49:06.480 --> 49:07.650
Simple as that.

49:09.250 --> 49:11.559
If rumors spread and become news,

49:11.659 --> 49:13.019
it will be bad for the company's image.

49:13.389 --> 49:15.389
I'll be home soon. Wait for me.

49:16.699 --> 49:17.699
Jin Hee,

49:18.030 --> 49:20.230
Ms. Woo is worried enough.

49:20.469 --> 49:21.969
Don't tell her and pretend that...

49:22.630 --> 49:23.800
you didn't see anything.

49:24.469 --> 49:27.969
How can I pretend? She needs to know.

49:28.110 --> 49:30.639
Sometimes, things are better kept as secret.

49:30.940 --> 49:34.780
Atmosphere here is as if a nuclear bomb dropped in this household.

49:35.449 --> 49:38.079
Also, you don't know for sure.

49:38.679 --> 49:41.219
Physical contact and laughing can't be considered as having an affair.

49:41.750 --> 49:43.760
That wasn't all.

49:43.989 --> 49:45.019
What?

49:45.690 --> 49:49.260
He always picked up Ji Hu after her art class.

49:49.389 --> 49:52.929
Also, he told me not to tell Ms. Woo.

49:53.429 --> 49:54.469
Is that true?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.969
So, that's where he went in the morning instead of cycling.

49:59.099 --> 50:00.469
I can't believe him.

50:00.940 --> 50:02.309
There's no trustworthy man.

50:02.440 --> 50:05.780
Their penises are what controls men.

50:06.280 --> 50:08.449
We need to chop them off.

50:10.050 --> 50:12.250
Well, about telling her...

50:17.719 --> 50:20.159
- Ms. Woo. - You're here. What about Ji Hu?

50:20.590 --> 50:22.789
- Your husband took her. - Okay.

50:25.429 --> 50:27.730
Did you want to tell me something?

50:28.630 --> 50:30.440
No. I figured it out.

50:30.739 --> 50:31.739
What was it?

50:32.840 --> 50:36.679
The video. I filmed Ji Hu playing the violin.

50:36.840 --> 50:40.309
All right. Eat dinner together and go home. I need some rest.

50:41.550 --> 50:45.719
You told me that you found the man in the video.

50:46.019 --> 50:47.019
Who was it?

51:20.989 --> 51:22.320
Seems like you're having a tea party.

51:22.849 --> 51:24.190
You're back.

51:24.260 --> 51:26.159
Enjoy. Let's go, Ji Hu.

51:28.460 --> 51:29.530
Go on.

51:43.579 --> 51:44.809
Is the problem solved?

51:45.440 --> 51:47.309
Yes. I think it is.

51:47.980 --> 51:48.980
In the meantime,

51:50.550 --> 51:54.519
don't ever call me until I call you.

51:54.820 --> 51:58.420
If it's utterly important, call me with someone else's phone.

51:58.889 --> 52:00.460
How will you contact me?

52:01.590 --> 52:03.860
I will use someone else's phone too.

52:04.460 --> 52:05.460
Whose phone?

52:06.559 --> 52:07.599
Ms. Park's.

52:10.570 --> 52:11.599
Where are you going?

52:12.239 --> 52:13.639
The place I used to live.

52:14.269 --> 52:15.969
I need to bring a few things.

52:16.840 --> 52:19.010
Congratulations on your marriage!

52:21.010 --> 52:22.179
It's still early.

52:23.980 --> 52:25.119
Goodbye,

52:26.750 --> 52:29.190
and wait for my call.

52:43.469 --> 52:44.940
Where is the caregiver?

52:45.639 --> 52:46.969
She went to her hometown.

52:47.570 --> 52:48.610
Did she quit?

52:50.840 --> 52:53.980
We're going to have a small wedding this weekend.

52:54.150 --> 52:57.849
She went home to say hello...

52:57.980 --> 52:59.380
to her relatives.

53:00.489 --> 53:03.219
Dad, are you really going to do this?

53:03.719 --> 53:05.659
Don't you guys want me to be happy?

53:06.360 --> 53:08.090
Then, just give your blessings.

53:08.429 --> 53:10.530
Just the two of us will do the ceremony.

53:10.760 --> 53:12.199
Don't try to stop us.

53:14.869 --> 53:18.269
Anyways, I had to tell you all,

53:18.800 --> 53:19.800
so I did.

53:20.739 --> 53:22.469
I will help you prepare, Father.

53:27.980 --> 53:30.849
What can I do other than to support you?

53:31.320 --> 53:32.780
I'll help you prepare.

53:33.619 --> 53:34.619
You are...

53:34.820 --> 53:38.119
quite not like the others.

54:01.010 --> 54:02.780
- Ms. Heo. - Jin Hee.

54:02.849 --> 54:05.750
- Ms. Woo. - Still here? What's the matter?

54:06.889 --> 54:08.949
- We need to talk. - Okay. Let's go in.

54:09.019 --> 54:11.889
No. Let's talk outside. Just the two of us.

54:12.289 --> 54:13.289
Okay.

54:14.730 --> 54:15.730
Let's go.

54:18.329 --> 54:20.070
What's the big deal?

54:20.900 --> 54:23.539
You look so tired.

54:24.900 --> 54:26.710
Things don't happen the way I want it to.

54:27.110 --> 54:28.969
Father will proceed with the marriage.

54:30.139 --> 54:31.480
Who can stop him.

54:32.079 --> 54:33.650
Just let it be.

54:34.110 --> 54:35.349
Tell me already.

54:35.480 --> 54:36.849
What's the matter?

54:38.480 --> 54:39.480
Ms. Woo,

54:40.449 --> 54:43.219
your husband is suspicious.

54:44.619 --> 54:45.789
- The thing is... - Stop!

54:49.690 --> 54:50.829
I'll look into it.

54:52.429 --> 54:54.900
I don't want to hear it from someone else.

54:56.570 --> 54:58.369
I'll look into it,

54:59.269 --> 55:02.309
and if I am mistaken...

55:02.610 --> 55:05.110
Okay. You can figure it out.

55:05.239 --> 55:06.909
I'll tell you if things go wrong.

55:09.380 --> 55:10.380
Okay.

55:11.079 --> 55:12.079
All right.

55:13.690 --> 55:16.289
Cheer up, Ms. Woo.

55:19.289 --> 55:20.289
Okay.

55:20.860 --> 55:23.530
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
Thank you.

55:29.869 --> 55:32.800
You hesitated because of how I may feel.

55:34.039 --> 55:36.440
- Yes. - I appreciate that.

55:37.610 --> 55:38.940
I know how that feels.

57:23.679 --> 57:26.449
(Jeong A, Beer and Liquor)

57:35.929 --> 57:37.329
- My gosh. - What a surprise.

57:39.199 --> 57:40.329
Is it you, Jeong A?

57:42.070 --> 57:43.269
Cho Hui!

57:44.599 --> 57:45.699
- My gosh. - Hey!

57:48.110 --> 57:50.610
Hey, it's been a while.

57:51.809 --> 57:54.280
You look the same.

57:54.349 --> 57:56.949
Nonsense. I've gotten older.

57:57.320 --> 57:59.349
But you look really good.

57:59.619 --> 58:00.650
Who's the guy?

58:02.489 --> 58:04.989
- Let's have a drink. - Before a meal?

58:05.119 --> 58:07.190
- Have you eaten yet? - I don't need food.

58:07.360 --> 58:09.190
Just bring some pollack and soju.

58:09.590 --> 58:12.599
Here it is.

58:15.769 --> 58:16.840
Smells good.

58:18.039 --> 58:19.340
What have you been up to these days?

58:20.739 --> 58:23.269
I am getting married.

58:23.780 --> 58:26.139
Is that so? Good for you!

58:26.679 --> 58:28.179
He must be rich.

58:29.349 --> 58:30.380
Yes.

58:31.650 --> 58:33.650
I am tired of working here.

58:36.550 --> 58:37.590
I...

58:38.820 --> 58:40.630
tried to find you.

58:42.059 --> 58:44.360
You're the only one...

58:45.030 --> 58:46.400
that I can trust.

58:48.730 --> 58:51.139
You're the only one who knows...

58:51.239 --> 58:53.570
that my real name is Cheon Bang Soon, not Lee Jeong A.

58:53.940 --> 58:56.440
And you were the only one who knows...

58:56.940 --> 58:59.840
that my real name is Park Bok Ja, not Park Cho Hui.

59:00.679 --> 59:03.079
But I live by my real name nowadays.

59:03.280 --> 59:04.280
Whatever.

59:05.650 --> 59:07.690
We must be tied by fate.

59:07.820 --> 59:09.849
Who knew we'd meet again?

59:12.219 --> 59:13.489
I hope we can...

59:13.889 --> 59:17.230
see each other more often.

59:55.769 --> 59:56.769
Dad.

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:03.210
Dad.

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.809
Dad.

01:00:10.719 --> 01:00:11.780
Dad.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.389
Dad.

01:00:19.119 --> 01:00:20.489
What do I do?

01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:24.699
Dad.

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:26.659
What do I do?

01:00:30.769 --> 01:00:32.539
Dad.

01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:38.380
Dad.

01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:57.130
(The Lady in Dignity)

01:00:57.599 --> 01:01:00.469
He told me that I am his sun.

01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:02.170
He'd never stress me out.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.500
Cheer up.

01:01:03.969 --> 01:01:05.039
This shall pass too.

01:01:09.269 --> 01:01:12.210
We need to stop her from taking control over Father.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.550
It's your prenuptial agreement.

01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:17.449
You told me that you only care about protecting Mr. Chairman, didn't you?

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.619
Tell Jae Gu to come back.

01:01:19.719 --> 01:01:22.150
He's the only one who can trample Park Bok Ja.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:25.519
It looks like my dad is marrying one special lady.

01:01:25.619 --> 01:01:27.559
Get lost! Get out of my sight.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.460
I feel insecure though.

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:32.860
I'm just not sure if I deserve...

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.469
to be this happy.

01:01:35.969 --> 01:01:38.539
She's a new maid who'll be working for us.

01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:40.409
Say hello. This is the younger son's wife.

01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:44.179
Ms. Woo, whose orders should I follow from now on?

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:48.449
From now on, I will make all decisions.
