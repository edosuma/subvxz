00:36.129 --> 00:39.129
Argh!

00:39.215 --> 00:41.215
Argh!

00:41.284 --> 00:42.284
Help!

00:43.861 --> 00:47.861
Get the beast out
before it cleaves me in two!

00:53.778 --> 00:57.678
Get your bastard hands inside me
and tug the bugger free!

00:57.716 --> 00:58.716
Fetch Treves.

01:04.715 --> 01:05.715
Chloroform, now!

01:05.716 --> 01:07.015
Which nimgimmer's this, then?

01:07.016 --> 01:10.016
The one who's to cut you open,
woman.

02:15.716 --> 02:19.715
Please, sir, he's mine.
I beg you!

02:19.716 --> 02:21.716
Please do not take him from me!

02:28.716 --> 02:31.715
Morning porter found her,
at the foot of the Eastern Stair.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.715
She came to you when?

02:33.716 --> 02:36.715
A touch after eight
this night last,

02:36.716 --> 02:40.715
as I prepared my testimony for the
Linklater enquiry. She was filthy.

02:40.716 --> 02:42.715
Cursed like a stevedore.

02:42.716 --> 02:47.715
Her son delivered by Caesar
one hour later and now removed.

02:47.716 --> 02:50.715
We know not where. Or by whom.

02:50.716 --> 02:53.715
Whoever pushed her down
that stairwell, I should think.

02:53.716 --> 02:55.715
With a mother now dead, poor child,

02:55.716 --> 02:57.715
vulnerable does not quite cover it,
Inspector.

02:57.716 --> 02:58.715
No belongings?

02:58.716 --> 03:01.715
Nothing to say her name
or who might miss her now?

03:01.716 --> 03:02.715
None.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.715
Then she goes
to my American at Leman Street.

03:05.716 --> 03:08.716
One last thing you should see.

03:11.716 --> 03:13.716
Sergeant, help me turn her.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.716
It may help identify her.

03:26.716 --> 03:27.716
Oh, blimey.

04:22.716 --> 04:24.716
Who's to say you are not beautiful?

04:26.716 --> 04:28.715
Wilson!

04:28.716 --> 04:32.715
Jedediah Shine lays his sergeant
in earth this morning.

04:32.716 --> 04:34.716
Needs must, our respects are paid.

04:40.716 --> 04:42.715
It is yet to be stated how,
precisely,

04:42.716 --> 04:44.715
Sergeant Linklater met his end.

04:44.716 --> 04:47.715
Granted, the iron railing
that passed through him had a say.

04:47.716 --> 04:49.715
But there are whisperings
on the wind, Wilson,

04:49.716 --> 04:53.716
our dear friend Edmund Reid may have
lent a shoulder to that passing.

04:54.716 --> 04:56.716
Talk of the wolf.

04:58.716 --> 04:59.716
How now, Inspector?

05:02.716 --> 05:05.716
Such an injury, Mr Reid.

05:06.716 --> 05:07.715
It changes a man.

05:07.716 --> 05:09.716
Humbles him, in fact.

05:11.716 --> 05:12.716
Humble Fred Best.

05:14.716 --> 05:16.716
I wonder how it is
you show your faces here.

05:21.716 --> 05:22.716
He was my friend.

05:24.716 --> 05:26.715
And yet you are happy to remain
at the side of a man

05:26.716 --> 05:30.715
whose hand is suspected
in that friend's own timely demise?

05:30.716 --> 05:33.715
You ought to be careful, Mr Shine,
making such statements.

05:33.716 --> 05:35.715
How, Sergeant?

05:35.716 --> 05:39.715
Fellas might ask,
what's to be gained from slurring

05:39.716 --> 05:41.715
the reputation of a man
such as Mr Reid.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.715
Yeah, indeed.

05:42.716 --> 05:45.715
And that slur hides the truth.
Whose?

05:45.716 --> 05:49.716
Yours! Inspector. Your activities
in this division.

05:50.716 --> 05:52.715
Wilson!

05:52.716 --> 05:54.716
You are a disgrace to badge
and uniform.

05:55.716 --> 05:59.715
It is your inspector here that is
the disgrace, and you would slur me?

05:59.716 --> 06:00.715
Then I must seek recompense.

06:00.716 --> 06:02.715
Then seek it, sir!

06:02.716 --> 06:04.715
Word had it
you'd left the roped ring.

06:04.716 --> 06:05.715
Word has it right.

06:05.716 --> 06:08.715
Well, then, I confess myself
relieved that you have not

06:08.716 --> 06:12.715
grown entirely soft...

06:12.716 --> 06:14.715
on your whore wife's
perjury of love.

06:14.716 --> 06:17.715
No. Not here. Not now.

06:17.716 --> 06:24.715
But soon, Sergeant. Once the world
has heard Mr Treves sworn testament

06:24.716 --> 06:28.716
and knows Inspector Reid
for the killer he is.

06:36.716 --> 06:39.715
Bruising and breakage
to the hip, pelvis,

06:39.716 --> 06:44.715
knee and back. Her humerus, radius
and ulna, however, are intact.

06:44.716 --> 06:46.715
She didn't use her arms
to break the fall.

06:46.716 --> 06:48.715
She kept the child
clutched to her chest.

06:48.716 --> 06:49.715
She died to protect it.

06:49.716 --> 06:51.715
A mother's instinct.

06:51.716 --> 06:52.715
Gone to nothing.

06:52.716 --> 06:56.716
Treves described her as filthy
and abject, didn't he?

06:57.716 --> 07:00.715
But I think she is beautiful.

07:00.716 --> 07:04.715
And whoever cared for her
thought the same.

07:04.716 --> 07:08.715
Torn and distressed. However,
the stitching is highly skilled...

07:08.716 --> 07:10.715
These threads, stolen most likely.

07:10.716 --> 07:13.716
Tell me,
did she steal her skin as well?

07:14.716 --> 07:18.715
See her face - zinc oxide.
It keeps the skin fair.

07:18.716 --> 07:19.715
Kept well for a while.

07:19.716 --> 07:21.716
Oh, she was kept perfect.

07:25.716 --> 07:30.715
And yet, no attempt was made
to remove... that from her.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.715
You think that makes her, what?
Less than human?

07:32.716 --> 07:34.715
We were all animals once,
it is now said.

07:34.716 --> 07:36.715
Some more closely related
than others.

07:36.716 --> 07:38.715
I would, in conscience,

07:38.716 --> 07:43.715
leave off riding Sergeant Drake.
He has buried a friend today.

07:43.716 --> 07:45.715
Blessed though she may be,
this woman was murdered

07:45.716 --> 07:47.715
and her child taken.

07:47.716 --> 07:49.715
This tail is a vestige.

07:49.716 --> 07:51.716
It is a memento
of all that we once were.

07:53.716 --> 07:54.876
In water, beneath the canopy.

07:56.716 --> 07:57.715
Sergeant Drake.

07:57.716 --> 08:00.715
The freak shows were
run off the street fronts last year,

08:00.716 --> 08:03.715
but there was talk, was there not,
of Tom Norman's troop splintering,

08:03.716 --> 08:05.715
a faction returning from Nottingham?

08:05.716 --> 08:08.716
Hidden away under the railway
arches, up on Artillery.

08:12.716 --> 08:14.715
Chief Inspector Abberline.

08:14.716 --> 08:15.716
Inspector Reid.

08:16.716 --> 08:18.716
Reinforcements.

08:29.716 --> 08:33.715
He's a boy. I said...
I asked... Not another boy.

08:33.716 --> 08:39.715
Sergeant? You are short here.
I am correct in that understanding?

08:39.716 --> 08:40.716
You are.

08:41.716 --> 08:45.715
He is. We are, sir.

08:45.716 --> 08:48.715
You believe there to be a line
outside my office, do you?

08:48.716 --> 08:52.715
A battalion of gnarled veterans,
each and every one of them

08:52.716 --> 08:54.715
begging to bring their fight
to your division?

08:54.716 --> 08:55.715
Light, friend? This one.

08:55.716 --> 08:58.715
Detective Constable Flight -

08:58.716 --> 09:03.715
worked overtime in uniform
on his own coin, his collar rate

09:03.716 --> 09:07.715
in so doing sufficient to push
both yours and mine into the corner.

09:07.716 --> 09:09.715
In Bloomsbury, Fred.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.715
And now appointed to the CID.
He wishes to work here.

09:13.716 --> 09:17.716
He volunteers for this sink,
Edmund. For Whitechapel.

09:23.716 --> 09:29.715
Inspector Reid. It is an honour.
I shan't let you down, sir.

09:29.716 --> 09:32.716
Easily said, Constable.
Harder to prove.

09:33.716 --> 09:35.716
Inspector, private word?

09:39.716 --> 09:41.715
Little birdie
hopped on my shoulder earlier.

09:41.716 --> 09:44.715
Told me a story about a ruckus
at a funeral.

09:44.716 --> 09:46.715
That birdie currently sporting
a tea cup for an ear?

09:46.716 --> 09:48.715
Oi! You two!

09:48.716 --> 09:51.715
If Drake cannot keep his spleen
inside him,

09:51.716 --> 09:54.715
it is up to you
to provide discipline.

09:54.716 --> 09:56.715
Oi!

09:56.716 --> 09:59.715
Sergeant Linklater was his friend.

09:59.716 --> 10:01.715
And Jedediah Shine is his superior.

10:01.716 --> 10:03.715
And if that superior
merits such insubordination,

10:03.716 --> 10:05.715
merits worse than that, perhaps?

10:05.716 --> 10:07.715
No. You leave be.

10:07.716 --> 10:13.715
It's not as if your name
is currently being sung from the
rooftops with the acme of probity.

10:13.716 --> 10:17.715
And should Treves not clear you
at that inquest, so it will remain.

10:17.716 --> 10:21.715
You are my friend, but, Ed -

10:21.716 --> 10:27.715
you make accusations against a man
of such standing without evidence.

10:27.716 --> 10:34.716
No. You hear me?
Inspector? Am I heard?

10:39.716 --> 10:40.716
To Artillery.

10:46.716 --> 10:49.715
All men of ambition need a trade
to fall back on, Miss Hart.

10:49.716 --> 10:53.715
A skill, which keeps both body
and soul apiece

10:53.716 --> 10:56.715
when the wind of fortune turns cold.

10:56.716 --> 10:59.716
So I'm glad to see you're not
broken by our new terms, Miss Hart.

11:07.716 --> 11:08.715
You do not wish to count it?

11:08.716 --> 11:12.716
We are friends.
And friends do not break trust.

11:13.716 --> 11:17.716
Or forget their obligations
to each other.

11:20.716 --> 11:25.715
Obligations which, should you need
reminder, might be forgot,

11:25.716 --> 11:31.715
within just one word and just
one night. If you have my meaning?

11:31.716 --> 11:33.716
If that will be all, Mr Duggan.

11:36.716 --> 11:37.715
Oh.

11:37.716 --> 11:39.715
Do send my regards
to your pistol twister.

11:39.716 --> 11:43.716
You must have him working those
skilled fingers to the knuckle.

12:01.716 --> 12:05.716
What ho! Caliban! I say!

12:07.716 --> 12:12.715
Wouldst thou seek to violate
the honour of my child?

12:12.716 --> 12:17.715
I will rack thee, Caliban,

12:17.716 --> 12:21.716
make thee roar that beasts
shall tremble at thy din.

12:35.716 --> 12:38.715
That's enough now, Sergeant,
I think.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.715
Now, now, lady.
This sideshow is now shut down.

12:41.716 --> 12:43.715
On what grounds?

12:43.716 --> 12:45.715
On the grounds of a murder inquiry,
Miss Pettigrew.

12:45.716 --> 12:50.715
Murder and abduction. An infant boy
taken from his murdered mother.

12:50.716 --> 12:53.715
And you believe
we can help you in this because?

12:53.716 --> 12:56.715
She also had a blessing.

12:56.716 --> 12:58.716
A protrusion at the base
of her spine.

13:00.716 --> 13:02.715
A tail?

13:02.716 --> 13:05.716
You must mean Stella Brooks.

13:06.716 --> 13:08.716
Oh, John.

13:12.716 --> 13:14.715
She was found last night, Mr Goode.

13:14.716 --> 13:15.716
And a child?

13:17.716 --> 13:20.715
You say, her child?

13:20.716 --> 13:23.716
A boy. We believe alive.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.715
But taken. Oh!

13:26.716 --> 13:29.715
When did you last see her, Mr Goode?

13:29.716 --> 13:33.715
Almost seven months ago to the day.

13:33.716 --> 13:34.715
That is precise recall.

13:34.716 --> 13:37.715
I have been looking for her.

13:37.716 --> 13:39.716
She was what - your lover?

13:44.716 --> 13:47.715
At the hospital,
she was unaccompanied?

13:47.716 --> 13:50.715
Nothing upon her
but the ragged clothes she wore.

13:50.716 --> 13:54.715
But those clothes... once pretty.

13:54.716 --> 13:56.715
She had been, at one point at least,
well treated.

13:56.716 --> 13:59.715
By folk with money. Here, brother.
Let me give you something.

13:59.716 --> 14:01.716
There is nothing for me!

14:14.716 --> 14:15.716
Out the way, Haystack.

14:21.716 --> 14:24.715
That man... trussed up as Caliban,
with you, all last night?

14:24.716 --> 14:27.716
He was.
And all here will confirm it.

14:29.716 --> 14:31.715
That's an impressive artifice
you got there.

14:31.716 --> 14:35.716
Oh, it's not artifice.
It's John's gift.

14:36.716 --> 14:41.715
He's impervious to pain.
But not, alas, to suffering.

14:41.716 --> 14:44.715
And Miss Brooks? What of her?

14:44.716 --> 14:49.715
Rootless. Orphaned. Tom Norman had
her displayed in a glass cabinet -

14:49.716 --> 14:50.715
only her rear, mind.

14:50.716 --> 14:54.715
For an extra penny, they could open
the box and a man might tug on her.

14:54.716 --> 14:55.715
And no family?

14:55.716 --> 14:59.715
No friends other than yourselves
to tell who might mean her such harm?

14:59.716 --> 15:03.716
There is a friend.
And he is known to you already, sir.

15:17.716 --> 15:20.715
You must, Joseph.

15:20.716 --> 15:24.716
You must say what you saw.

15:25.716 --> 15:26.716
Come!

15:28.716 --> 15:29.716
Mr Treves.

15:32.716 --> 15:35.715
How can I help you, Inspector?

15:35.716 --> 15:37.716
I'd have you confirm something.

15:42.716 --> 15:44.715
What of it?

15:44.716 --> 15:47.715
In one week, you will
stand in front of a judicial inquiry

15:47.716 --> 15:51.715
and pronounce what took my sergeant
from this life.

15:51.716 --> 15:54.715
I would know now if you will tell
precisely what it was

15:54.716 --> 15:59.715
you witnessed when you came upon
Edmund Reid at my man's bedside.

15:59.716 --> 16:02.716
That is for me to share
with none other than the coroner.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.715
Good day to you.

16:09.716 --> 16:10.716
Good day, Mr Merrick.

16:15.716 --> 16:16.716
You are a good man, sir.

16:19.716 --> 16:24.715
But you have no clue of
the suffering that is meted out

16:24.716 --> 16:25.715
in the Leman Street cells.

16:25.716 --> 16:28.715
Suffering that

16:28.716 --> 16:32.716
Inspector Reid sanctions
in the name of investigation.

16:34.716 --> 16:36.715
Mr Treves?

16:36.716 --> 16:37.715
J...Joseph?

16:37.716 --> 16:40.715
There is a matter urgent,

16:40.716 --> 16:44.715
I believe,
which I would share with you.

16:44.716 --> 16:46.756
Mr Merrick. I don't believe
I have had the pleasure.

16:51.716 --> 16:55.716
I... My... My apologies.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.716
Do not disturb.

17:25.715 --> 17:31.715
Hush now. No panic, Mr M.
No harm is meant here.

17:31.716 --> 17:33.716
Not yet, leastwise.

17:38.716 --> 17:41.715
Please, my supports...

17:41.716 --> 17:44.716
I'm suffocating...

17:49.716 --> 17:50.716
Upsadaisy.

17:52.716 --> 17:54.715
So it is true, then?

17:54.716 --> 17:58.716
You must sleep upright, like a
marionette on a puppeteer's shelf?

18:02.716 --> 18:06.715
This life - six bags of shit
till Sunday, is it not?

18:06.716 --> 18:08.716
And here am I
about to make yours worse.

18:10.716 --> 18:15.715
You see, it strikes me you may have
laid eyes on me some place before.

18:15.716 --> 18:19.716
The night my man Linklater passed?

18:21.716 --> 18:27.715
No, I... I must have myself confused.

18:27.716 --> 18:30.715
That is a relief.

18:30.716 --> 18:32.716
Nevertheless...

18:34.716 --> 18:36.716
I hope neither of us
will now forget the other.

18:38.716 --> 18:43.715
Forget how easy it is for me to come
by and say, "How do, Mr Merrick?

18:43.716 --> 18:47.715
"I do hope the day finds you well.
And safe.

18:47.716 --> 18:51.715
"And not inclined to say nothing
you should not."

18:51.716 --> 18:53.716
Are we understood, sir?

19:08.716 --> 19:11.715
Sergeant Artherton,
how do we find Mr Flight?

19:11.716 --> 19:14.715
He is calm, sir. And quiet.

19:14.716 --> 19:17.715
Which is a bonus. Mr Flight,
would you agree with that assessment?

19:17.716 --> 19:19.715
I would always agree
with my sergeant.

19:19.716 --> 19:21.715
Oh, biddable, are we? Servile, even?

19:21.716 --> 19:23.715
We shall see. For now, Detective,

19:23.716 --> 19:25.715
let's see how developed your archive
and telegraph skills are.

19:25.716 --> 19:29.715
John Goode. A common enough name
and most uncommon man.

19:29.716 --> 19:30.715
See what you can find.

19:30.716 --> 19:32.715
I want to know
why he would run from us.

19:32.716 --> 19:35.715
Follow me. Up here, son.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.716
Yes, sir.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.715
Mr Merrick.

19:45.716 --> 19:46.715
Mr Merrick...

19:46.716 --> 19:49.716
Detective Inspector Reid.
I'd hoped to talk with you.

19:51.716 --> 19:52.715
Please. I... I am not well.

19:52.716 --> 19:54.715
I have only a few questions,
Mr Merrick.

19:54.716 --> 19:56.715
I have said that I am unwell!!

19:56.716 --> 19:58.715
Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir...

19:58.716 --> 20:04.715
No! You overstep, Inspector. Or have
you no respect for my wishes?

20:04.716 --> 20:05.715
Of course.

20:05.716 --> 20:07.715
But it is a friend of yours
from the side shows... No, sir!

20:07.716 --> 20:11.715
Reid! This is unconscionable!

20:11.716 --> 20:14.715
You will not bring your Leman Street
ways to this hospital again.

20:14.716 --> 20:17.716
But... No, sir.

20:23.716 --> 20:24.756
Joseph. I'm sorry, Joseph.

20:32.716 --> 20:34.715
Does Mr Merrick
have knowledge of her, sir?

20:34.716 --> 20:38.716
If he does, he will not
share it with me.

20:39.716 --> 20:43.715
John Goode's books.
That's some technical reading.

20:43.716 --> 20:47.715
Mr Galton.
Mr Galton is a cousin of Mr Darwin.

20:47.716 --> 20:48.715
This, he investigates

20:48.716 --> 20:51.715
if our abilities might be
inherited from our parents,

20:51.716 --> 20:56.715
and if we, in turn, hand on
those same abilities to our children.

20:56.716 --> 20:58.715
Pugilism, for example.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.715
Or depravity. Quite.

21:00.716 --> 21:06.715
Here, his argument evolves.
He invents a term - eugenics.

21:06.716 --> 21:08.715
Suggests that the qualities
to which we might aspire

21:08.716 --> 21:11.715
could be bred into the family line.

21:11.716 --> 21:12.715
And what of the weak?

21:12.716 --> 21:16.715
The weak, the idle, the ugly,
the dim-witted, the mad.

21:16.716 --> 21:18.715
The deformed?

21:18.716 --> 21:20.716
They are to be bred out.

21:29.716 --> 21:30.716
Take a seat, Detective.

21:34.716 --> 21:35.715
Drink, Flight?

21:35.716 --> 21:37.715
My thanks. No.

21:37.716 --> 21:39.715
A Mick that doesn't take a sip, uh?

21:39.716 --> 21:42.715
And a unicorn stopped traffic
on the East India Dock Road.

21:42.716 --> 21:44.715
What do you have, Flight?

21:44.716 --> 21:45.715
John Goode, sir.

21:45.716 --> 21:47.715
Sit down. Not so hard to dig out.

21:47.716 --> 21:50.715
The man has history here, recent,
but history nonetheless.

21:50.716 --> 21:52.716
Fines for drunken brawling, mainly.

21:54.716 --> 21:57.715
Ropemakers, The Trinity - that's
low-rent boozing, even round here.

21:57.716 --> 21:59.715
The first we know of him here.
He and a woman breaking the peace,

21:59.716 --> 22:01.715
assaulting one another
in the street.

22:01.716 --> 22:03.716
And see her name, Mr Reid...

22:05.716 --> 22:07.715
Stella Brooks.

22:07.716 --> 22:11.715
Nothing before, not a sneeze,
and then September 22nd, this.

22:11.716 --> 22:13.715
Almost precisely seven months past.
When she leaves him.

22:13.716 --> 22:16.715
And his behaviour degenerating
in her absence.

22:16.716 --> 22:17.715
And this the reason for her leaving?

22:17.716 --> 22:20.715
Did she drop on him the news
that she carried his child?

22:20.716 --> 22:21.715
He didn't exactly rejoice.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.715
They fight. She leaves.
And he hunts her.

22:23.716 --> 22:26.715
He hunts her down the same streets.

22:26.716 --> 22:30.715
Here - more arrests for vagrancy,
drunkeness.

22:30.716 --> 22:34.715
Ropemakers, Trinity, Thomas Street.
There's pattern to his behaviour.

22:34.716 --> 22:37.715
And so, I thought, Inspector,

22:37.716 --> 22:39.715
if I took a turn
through those streets myself,

22:39.716 --> 22:43.716
I might build an understanding of
him, may indeed pick up his trail.

22:46.716 --> 22:48.715
Then go.

22:48.716 --> 22:50.715
Flight - Drake goes with you.

22:50.716 --> 22:52.715
I'm sure Mrs Drake expects
the sergeant.

22:52.716 --> 22:55.716
He's right. She does. Take Drake
or you're scrubbing latrines.

22:57.716 --> 22:59.715
Nursemaid, is it?

22:59.716 --> 23:00.716
Just watch him.

23:02.716 --> 23:04.715
You know, Drake or no Drake -

23:04.716 --> 23:07.715
this place is going to shit
in his shoes one day or the next.

23:07.716 --> 23:08.716
He ain't Hobbs.

23:10.716 --> 23:12.716
He ain't.

23:14.716 --> 23:16.715
Will you eat, Captain?

23:16.716 --> 23:19.715
Sorry, Reid. I got, er,
I got dinner with the lady tonight.

23:19.716 --> 23:21.716
Oh, of course, of course, of course.

23:29.716 --> 23:33.715
The challenge we face, therefore,
those of us who rightly

23:33.716 --> 23:37.715
refuse to accept the biological
status of our species,

23:37.716 --> 23:41.715
is how the debilities and handicaps

23:41.716 --> 23:48.715
that impair our existence
might be corrected for our heirs.

23:48.716 --> 23:54.716
What is called for, I believe, is
courage, the courage and conviction.

23:55.716 --> 24:01.715
Systematically, to experiment upon
the whole process of breeding.

24:01.716 --> 24:04.716
But not amongst Sativa or Crustacea.

24:05.716 --> 24:08.715
On complex organisms...

24:08.716 --> 24:12.716
organisms more like ourselves,
in fact.

24:25.716 --> 24:33.715
The correction and improvement
of humankind is indeed realisable.

24:33.716 --> 24:34.716
Thank you.

24:36.716 --> 24:37.715
I say?

24:37.716 --> 24:39.715
Hello, there?

24:39.716 --> 24:43.715
I say, this wing
is research fellows only.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.715
Do I know you?

24:45.716 --> 24:48.716
Oi! Get back here.

24:54.716 --> 24:58.716
Three separate occasions,
he was ejected for brawling.

24:59.716 --> 25:02.715
Only two of us in that doss-house.
We get cornered.

25:02.716 --> 25:04.715
It's a long fight out.

25:04.716 --> 25:06.716
Should we be so frightened,
Sergeant?

25:08.716 --> 25:12.716
Come then, Constable.
I shall show you.

25:22.716 --> 25:24.716
Pretty, ain't it?

25:25.716 --> 25:27.716
John Goode?

25:31.716 --> 25:33.716
I seek a John Goode.

25:34.716 --> 25:36.716
How does one find a man
in such a place?

25:38.716 --> 25:41.716
They are not men no more.
You may not tell 'em apart.

25:48.716 --> 25:50.716
Come. Our luck is already chanced.

25:52.716 --> 25:54.716
John Goode? Oi!

25:56.716 --> 25:58.715
Do you bob from me?

25:58.716 --> 26:00.715
Police. Get back.

26:00.716 --> 26:04.715
Pigs! Bloody fool!
Pigs in the pen.

26:04.716 --> 26:05.716
Back off!

26:10.716 --> 26:16.715
Back! Back off! Run!

26:16.716 --> 26:18.716
Clever fellow, ain't ya?

26:35.716 --> 26:39.716
Tough bugger, ain't you?

26:40.716 --> 26:44.715
Right, Detective Constable,
run along now.

26:44.716 --> 26:46.715
Is there no-one at home
waits for you, Albert?

26:46.716 --> 26:48.715
Not currently, Mrs Drake.

26:48.716 --> 26:49.715
You should call me Bella.

26:49.716 --> 26:52.715
You should call her Mrs Drake.

26:52.716 --> 26:56.715
I lay my head at Mrs Burton's
lodging house on Commercial Street.

26:56.716 --> 26:59.715
Once I am settled, I shall find
more permanent accommodation.

26:59.716 --> 27:02.715
Well, head you home
and get your rest.

27:02.716 --> 27:04.715
Rest, Mrs Drake?

27:04.716 --> 27:07.715
Not this night.
Villainy does not rest.

27:07.716 --> 27:10.716
I do not intend to either.
My thanks, Mrs Drake. Sergeant.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.715
Where did you come from?

27:15.716 --> 27:17.716
Over the hills and far away.

27:20.716 --> 27:23.716
What's stopping us? Life ain't work.

27:24.716 --> 27:25.716
Cairo, you and me.

27:27.716 --> 27:29.715
Your sergeant's salary
stretches this far, does it? No.

27:29.716 --> 27:32.715
We're going to take what we've made
here, we're going to cash in...

27:32.716 --> 27:35.715
And what has been made here,
save the names Long Susan

27:35.716 --> 27:37.715
and Captain Jackson?
C'mon, I see the bills you count.

27:37.716 --> 27:39.715
I see the numbers you scratched in,
in that ledger.

27:39.716 --> 27:43.716
Yes, but once counted, you do not
see where those bills leave to.

27:46.716 --> 27:51.716
Nothing here is yours.
Nothing here is mine.

27:55.716 --> 27:57.716
Then whose?

28:01.716 --> 28:05.715
Three years - you never asked.
Never cared.

28:05.716 --> 28:07.715
Hey, you're the one that wanted to
play business-lady

28:07.716 --> 28:08.716
and now I'm asking.

28:11.716 --> 28:13.716
Whose is it?

28:18.716 --> 28:19.716
Whose?!

28:22.716 --> 28:24.715
Silas Duggan.

28:24.716 --> 28:29.715
'..businesswoman who gives all
the profits away to somebody else,

28:29.716 --> 28:31.715
'I wonder why
I didn't think of that!?'

28:31.716 --> 28:33.715
I swear to God, you...

28:33.716 --> 28:35.716
are as dead in the head
as this slab of meat!

28:37.716 --> 28:39.715
How could you be
so god damn reckless?

28:39.716 --> 28:41.715
So, so, so, so god damn...
What?! What?!

28:41.716 --> 28:43.715
..irresponsible!? From you!

28:43.716 --> 28:45.715
I mean it. I had a right to know.

28:45.716 --> 28:50.715
You have no rights,
save the ones you took, for gratis,

28:50.716 --> 28:53.715
each and every night,
in my view and hearing.

28:53.716 --> 28:54.715
Things were different then.

28:54.716 --> 28:57.715
No. The same.

28:57.716 --> 29:04.715
And the same reality prevails.
This place - its people and profits.

29:04.716 --> 29:07.716
The property of... Silas Duggan.

29:09.716 --> 29:15.716
We were destitute, wanted, criminal.

29:17.716 --> 29:23.715
Not what you would call a sound
investment. Duggan took the chance.

29:23.716 --> 29:30.716
No. What he took was our lives,
Susan. Ground rent plus 50% income.

29:38.716 --> 29:40.715
Any more, Mr Shine?

29:40.716 --> 29:43.716
Sufficient, I think, Mr Duggan.

29:46.716 --> 29:50.715
Barton, good of you to come
when summoned.

29:50.716 --> 29:53.715
I wait on your orders, Inspector,
you know that.

29:53.716 --> 29:56.715
Nothing like loyalty,
is there, Mr Duggan?

29:56.716 --> 29:59.715
Oh, nothing in the world, Mr Shine.

29:59.716 --> 30:01.715
I'm relieving you of your
everyday duties, Barton,

30:01.716 --> 30:03.716
send you to some surveillance.

30:04.716 --> 30:07.716
Because as we know,
elephants do not forget.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.715
Inspector Reid!

30:19.716 --> 30:20.715
I will not stand.

30:20.716 --> 30:23.715
Mr Merrick. I am well known to you
and I mean no harm.

30:23.716 --> 30:26.715
I come only to enquire
after a friend to you - Stella.

30:26.716 --> 30:29.715
Stella Brooks,
delivered of her child

30:29.716 --> 30:34.716
just hours before she... met her death
here, sir, on these corridors.

30:46.716 --> 30:49.715
When was it you last saw her?

30:49.716 --> 30:52.715
September. L... last year.

30:52.716 --> 30:56.715
After they had fought
and she had left him? Yes.

30:56.716 --> 31:00.715
And can you say,
was it on account of her pregnancy?

31:00.716 --> 31:04.715
She said she could not forgive him.

31:04.716 --> 31:06.715
Because he struck her?

31:06.716 --> 31:08.715
No - she could not forgive him

31:08.716 --> 31:13.716
for... for the rage
he felt at the child inside her.

31:15.716 --> 31:20.715
Did she say where it was
she meant to go?

31:20.716 --> 31:22.715
To John's father - a doctor.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.715
And did Goode know this?

31:24.716 --> 31:30.715
John had for ever kept his family a
secret from her, his true name also.

31:30.716 --> 31:33.715
The father, a man of wealth,
well able to care for her

31:33.716 --> 31:35.716
and her child -
did she mention a name?

31:37.716 --> 31:44.715
No, she did not, Mr Reid.
I cannot help you further, I...

31:44.716 --> 31:47.716
Mr Merrick,
your help in this matter...

31:48.716 --> 31:50.716
..it is invaluable.

32:06.716 --> 32:09.715
Been like this all night, they have.
'Your ingratitude is dazzling!'

32:09.716 --> 32:12.715
Oh, so I'm supposed to be grateful
for this slave status, huh?

32:12.716 --> 32:14.715
Oh, good morning, Reid.

32:14.716 --> 32:16.715
And, er, what is it
that brings you by?

32:16.716 --> 32:18.715
There's insight I'd share with you.

32:18.716 --> 32:21.715
So you didn't come for your shirts
then?

32:21.716 --> 32:24.715
Oh, come on -
you truly believe I cannot tell

32:24.716 --> 32:26.715
when another man's shirts
are laundered in my own house?

32:26.716 --> 32:28.715
Although given your head,
you would not have it so

32:28.716 --> 32:31.715
a great deal longer now, would you?

32:31.716 --> 32:37.715
What? You will not tell your friend
and accomplice? Then allow me.

32:37.716 --> 32:42.715
Your mercenary hireling
has designs on a change of location.

32:42.716 --> 32:44.715
Wishes to up and leave you,
Inspector.

32:44.716 --> 32:46.716
Come on, don't be such a baby, Reid.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.715
You think this is
the garden spot of the world?

32:50.716 --> 32:53.715
My one ambition to remain here,
chained to you?

32:53.716 --> 32:56.716
Anyway - it's not like I'll be
sailing away any time soon!

32:57.716 --> 33:02.715
You know, this brooding martyr thing
you perfect - it can really grate.

33:02.716 --> 33:04.716
John Goode. Not his real name.

33:06.716 --> 33:08.715
What of him?

33:08.716 --> 33:11.715
A rich man's son,
finding fellowship in a freak show.

33:11.716 --> 33:13.715
We must ask why.
The thing with the poker.

33:13.716 --> 33:15.715
It's a skill, not a handicap.
But the palsy...

33:15.716 --> 33:17.715
The tremor in him.
So whilst I still may make use of it,

33:17.716 --> 33:20.716
set your great medical mind
to that, will you?

33:27.716 --> 33:29.715
Detective Constable Flight.

33:29.716 --> 33:30.715
Mr Reid.

33:30.716 --> 33:32.715
In the future, you will do
Sergeant Drake the service

33:32.716 --> 33:36.715
of knowing what is best
for you. Will you not?

33:36.716 --> 33:37.715
I will, sir.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.715
Now, speak.

33:39.716 --> 33:43.715
John Goode has been incarcerated -
not in gaol, however.

33:43.716 --> 33:45.715
Two spells at The Lark House Asylum.

33:45.716 --> 33:49.715
Can you speculate
as to which physician?

33:49.716 --> 33:50.715
Karl Crabbe.

33:50.716 --> 33:51.715
The very same.

33:51.716 --> 33:54.716
What tricks did he play
on Mr Goode, I wonder?

34:17.716 --> 34:19.715
Inspector Reid.

34:19.716 --> 34:23.716
A pleasing interruption
to an otherwise dull year.

34:33.716 --> 34:35.716
I forget.

34:38.716 --> 34:42.715
Oh, really, Inspector?
In the current mood?

34:42.716 --> 34:46.715
My mind advances,
but my frame is frail.

34:46.716 --> 34:48.715
How would your newly sullied
reputation cope

34:48.716 --> 34:52.715
with another interview
concluding in a man's death?

34:52.716 --> 34:55.716
Gossip, Reid.
It's a fact of prison life.

34:58.716 --> 35:00.715
Were I to tell you
the life of an infant boy

35:00.716 --> 35:03.716
depended on your speaking,
might that make impact?

35:04.716 --> 35:05.715
Not really.

35:05.716 --> 35:07.716
Then what, Doctor?

35:11.716 --> 35:14.715
There is a tale told, Inspector.

35:14.716 --> 35:18.716
The guards here tell it.
Of your wife.

35:19.716 --> 35:22.716
Rending herself
in the Leman Street gutter.

35:23.716 --> 35:26.715
Sergeant Drake has heard
the tale too, I see.

35:26.716 --> 35:29.715
How difficult for you all.

35:29.716 --> 35:30.715
What is it you want?

35:30.716 --> 35:35.716
To hear it from you, Reid.
The man who brought me so low.

35:39.716 --> 35:40.715
Sergeant Drake.

35:40.716 --> 35:42.715
Sir? Leave us.

35:42.716 --> 35:44.716
But... You heard, Sergeant.

36:05.716 --> 36:08.715
Captain Jackson found her.
In The Bear.

36:08.716 --> 36:12.715
Barely dressed, it is said.
Demanding drink.

36:12.716 --> 36:18.715
He attempted to remove her.
She would not be removed.

36:18.716 --> 36:20.715
And so he carried her.

36:20.716 --> 36:22.715
Which is when she screamed.

36:22.716 --> 36:25.715
In the street. You tended to her?

36:25.716 --> 36:27.715
I did.

36:27.716 --> 36:30.716
Your sergeant,
all others to bear witness?

36:33.716 --> 36:35.715
And no man to ask you why?

36:35.716 --> 36:37.716
Why such hysteria grew in her.

36:40.716 --> 36:46.716
What cruelty could possibly merit
so public a humiliation?

36:51.716 --> 36:53.716
What did you do to her, Inspector?

36:58.716 --> 37:00.716
I...

37:02.716 --> 37:04.716
..I lied.

37:05.716 --> 37:07.716
Lied, you say?

37:09.716 --> 37:11.716
On what subject?

37:12.716 --> 37:13.716
Damn you!

37:23.716 --> 37:26.716
I offered her unfair hope
and I deceived her.

37:28.716 --> 37:32.715
I gave her false cause
to believe our lost daughter alive.

37:32.716 --> 37:34.716
And I took another woman to my bed.

37:41.716 --> 37:43.715
Do you know, Inspector,
of all the emotions,

37:43.716 --> 37:46.716
which is the most insidious
and entrapping?

37:49.716 --> 37:50.716
Shame.

37:52.716 --> 37:57.715
It carves its home
in the marrow of your bones

37:57.716 --> 38:00.716
and rests there for all time.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.715
Where can I find him?
This John Goode.

38:24.716 --> 38:28.716
Whatever he is truly called.
My secrets for his.

38:31.716 --> 38:32.716
A name I cannot give you.

38:33.716 --> 38:36.715
But there is a father,
a doctor, as you know.

38:36.716 --> 38:37.715
And there was a brother.

38:37.716 --> 38:41.715
Both boys subjected to a regime,
a physical regime akin,

38:41.716 --> 38:43.715
you might say, to torture.

38:43.716 --> 38:45.715
Feats of strength insisted upon.

38:45.716 --> 38:48.715
Their bodies stretched from
an early age, beaten with sticks,

38:48.716 --> 38:49.715
bent double. But to what end,
however?

38:49.716 --> 38:52.715
He could never articulate it
with precision.

38:52.716 --> 38:56.715
Only that he and his brother
shared a curse.

38:56.716 --> 39:00.715
A curse that killed the boys'
mother. A curse of the blood.

39:00.716 --> 39:02.715
And what of the brother?

39:02.716 --> 39:07.716
Drowned himself one morning, beneath
the waters of the Serpentine.

39:08.716 --> 39:11.715
The child you fear for,

39:11.716 --> 39:15.716
if it is Goode's,
he will think it similarly cursed.

39:28.716 --> 39:32.715
A curse of the blood, as Dr Crabbe
would have it, Goode's palsy,

39:32.716 --> 39:34.715
the premature death of his mother.

39:34.716 --> 39:35.715
An inherited handicap.

39:35.716 --> 39:38.716
Yes, and so - the medical mind?

39:40.716 --> 39:45.715
Huntington's Chorea! Huntington's
Chorea. Slow death sentence, Reid.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.715
What?

39:47.716 --> 39:50.715
The piecemeal loss of all
that makes you feel human.

39:50.716 --> 39:55.715
If either or both of the parents
manifest signs of the disease,

39:55.716 --> 39:58.715
one or more of the offspring
will invariably suffer also.

39:58.716 --> 40:01.715
If, however, those children
manage to go through life

40:01.716 --> 40:04.715
and never manifest,
the thread is broken.

40:04.716 --> 40:05.715
The reason why, then,

40:05.716 --> 40:08.715
this doctor father
sought to make his sons impervious?

40:08.716 --> 40:10.715
To breed out the mutation.

40:10.716 --> 40:13.715
What, then, would he have made
of Miss Brooks' tail?

40:13.716 --> 40:16.715
Perhaps he did not get sight of it.
Not for a good while.

40:16.716 --> 40:18.715
He enjoyed her beauty,
until he claps eyes on her behind.

40:18.716 --> 40:21.715
His disgust
sending her to the streets.

40:21.716 --> 40:24.715
Until... Until he wonders
at his grandson,

40:24.716 --> 40:26.715
at what manner of man
he might become.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.716
And goes to reclaim him.

41:00.716 --> 41:04.715
Five, sir. Five men drowned
in the Serpentine that year.

41:04.716 --> 41:08.715
Corcoran. Robert Corcoran, age 25.

41:08.716 --> 41:12.715
There is a zoologist
named Corcoran.

41:12.716 --> 41:14.715
He's a... He's a research fellow

41:14.716 --> 41:17.715
at the Natural History extension
of the British Museum.

41:17.716 --> 41:21.715
He concerns himself almost
exclusively with the practical

41:21.716 --> 41:25.715
development of theories first
pronounced by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.

41:25.716 --> 41:28.715
The biological inheritance
of acquired characteristics.

41:28.716 --> 41:31.715
Our children, Flight. The strength
and skills acquired in this life,

41:31.716 --> 41:35.715
so he proposes, may be handed down
to those who must live the next.

41:35.716 --> 41:38.715
Corcoran is Goode's father,
Corcoran has the child.

41:38.716 --> 41:40.715
Sergeant Drake, a hansom.
We are for South Kensington.

41:40.716 --> 41:42.716
Sir, should I...?

41:44.716 --> 41:46.716
Big boy's game now, son.

42:18.716 --> 42:21.715
Mr, take your mask off.

42:21.716 --> 42:24.716
Go on, take your mask off.

42:56.716 --> 42:59.716
Back! All of you! Back!

43:01.716 --> 43:05.716
Sir. Here, sir. With me.

43:08.716 --> 43:11.715
What is wrong with you?

43:11.716 --> 43:14.715
This man is your fellow!
You would stone him?!

43:14.716 --> 43:16.715
You call him monster?!

43:16.716 --> 43:19.716
Hm? Look on your own sins!

43:21.716 --> 43:24.715
Sir, what is it
that's brought you here?

43:24.716 --> 43:26.715
Inspector Reid.

43:26.716 --> 43:31.715
I...I would speak with him.

43:31.716 --> 43:33.715
I...I believe it urgent.

43:33.716 --> 43:35.715
The Inspector pursues a case.

43:35.716 --> 43:38.716
But I might bring you to him, sir.

43:45.716 --> 43:47.716
Driver! Step to it.

44:02.716 --> 44:04.715
Alexander.

44:04.716 --> 44:05.716
Hello, Papa.

44:09.716 --> 44:10.715
Is he well?

44:10.716 --> 44:14.715
He is fed and begins to thrive.

44:14.716 --> 44:18.715
And the future? Is his blood cursed?

44:18.716 --> 44:21.715
Well, the science is not yet exact.

44:21.716 --> 44:26.715
But the work we performed, you
and I, your strength, Alexander...

44:26.716 --> 44:32.715
My strength,
my strength to absorb your pain.

44:32.716 --> 44:34.715
I made you strong

44:34.716 --> 44:37.715
so that our descendants
might not suffer your curse.

44:37.716 --> 44:39.716
I have hope for this boy.

44:44.716 --> 44:46.716
But none for myself.

44:48.716 --> 44:49.716
Not then, not now.

44:51.716 --> 44:52.716
No.

44:55.716 --> 45:02.715
His mother, Stella.
The day she came to you.

45:02.716 --> 45:07.715
You must have rejoiced at her?
So fine, so strong.

45:07.716 --> 45:14.715
What happened? Did you finally
have full sight of her?

45:14.716 --> 45:16.715
That thing.

45:16.716 --> 45:18.715
We are not so backward as a race

45:18.716 --> 45:20.715
that she could not
have had it removed.

45:20.716 --> 45:23.715
But do you not see, Father?

45:23.716 --> 45:26.716
She had the most fortunate gift
of all.

45:28.716 --> 45:33.716
She felt no shame for who she was.

45:35.716 --> 45:37.715
And you killed her.

45:37.716 --> 45:40.715
She would not hand him to me.

45:40.716 --> 45:46.715
Slipped. Had she only understood
what was best for the child...

45:46.716 --> 45:50.715
Best for him! What is best for him?

45:50.716 --> 45:55.715
That he suffer witnessing
your everyday revolution of hope

45:55.716 --> 45:57.715
and despair at his progress?

45:57.716 --> 46:00.716
Or lack of it? Is that his future?

46:01.716 --> 46:02.715
No.

46:02.716 --> 46:04.716
Best he never knows you.

46:06.716 --> 46:09.715
Or me. Or himself.

46:09.716 --> 46:13.716
Alexander,
you hand that boy back to me!

46:15.716 --> 46:18.716
I am too well-conditioned, Father.

46:21.716 --> 46:23.715
Alexander, stop!

46:23.716 --> 46:26.716
Alexander! Stop!

46:27.716 --> 46:29.716
Stop!

46:35.716 --> 46:37.716
Alexander, do not hurt that child!

46:41.716 --> 46:44.716
Alexander!

46:49.716 --> 46:51.715
William Corcoran?
Where is the child?

46:51.716 --> 46:54.715
You are for jail, sir.
Murder and abduction.

46:54.716 --> 46:56.716
I care not for myself, officer.

46:59.716 --> 47:02.715
No! Wait! Mr Goode, wait!

47:02.716 --> 47:05.715
Back! Back, stay back!

47:05.716 --> 47:09.715
Mr Goode. I beg you, I beg you.
Think what you are doing.

47:09.716 --> 47:12.715
I know all too well.

47:12.716 --> 47:15.715
I seek only to reduce

47:15.716 --> 47:18.715
the amount of suffering
in this world. We are cursed!

47:18.716 --> 47:22.716
But sir, I beg you. The child's fate
cannot yet be known.

47:30.716 --> 47:33.716
Please, John! Listen to him!

47:35.716 --> 47:36.715
Joseph?

47:36.716 --> 47:39.715
Mr Reid is known to me, John.

47:39.716 --> 47:44.715
I...I... I... I trust in him,
would... would help him.

47:44.716 --> 47:46.716
Would... would help you.

47:52.716 --> 47:57.715
No-one can help, Joseph.
My brother knew that.

47:57.716 --> 48:01.715
But what of Stella's wishes
for her child?

48:01.716 --> 48:09.715
She is gone, Joseph, and this child
and I, we are left with this truth.

48:09.716 --> 48:14.715
And what is that?
That there is no hope for you?

48:14.716 --> 48:17.715
There is a monster in him.

48:17.716 --> 48:21.716
As surely as there is one in me.

48:30.716 --> 48:34.715
John, look at me. Do it.

48:34.716 --> 48:35.716
Do it!

48:40.716 --> 48:43.716
Am I not monstrous?

48:46.716 --> 48:50.715
It is the truth
of my every waking moment.

48:50.716 --> 48:56.715
And yet, despite all, I feel joy.

48:56.716 --> 48:58.715
No, I do, I do!

48:58.716 --> 49:04.716
I hear the bells ring from my room,
the chatter of the nurses.

49:05.716 --> 49:09.715
Once, beyond my window,

49:09.716 --> 49:16.716
I...I watched one of their number
make love to the night porter.

49:17.716 --> 49:23.715
I...I... I have never known that,
John.

49:23.716 --> 49:27.715
The... the secret intimacy
of a woman,

49:27.716 --> 49:33.716
that might have told me
I was... desired.

49:34.716 --> 49:38.715
Beautiful in another's eyes.

49:38.716 --> 49:40.716
You, you have known that, John.

49:41.716 --> 49:45.715
Do... do you remember it?

49:45.716 --> 49:47.715
I do.

49:47.716 --> 49:50.715
And what does it feel like?

49:50.716 --> 49:52.716
It felt like peace.

49:54.716 --> 50:02.715
Would you deny your son
that peace, that... that joy?

50:02.716 --> 50:04.716
That... that hope?

50:07.716 --> 50:10.716
It is life, John.

50:12.716 --> 50:13.716
Only life.

50:15.716 --> 50:18.716
What you hold in your arms.

50:45.716 --> 50:51.715
For ever and always, Mr Merrick,
I shall remember you for this.

50:51.716 --> 50:58.715
He is my friend.
You would do no less, Mr Reid.

50:58.716 --> 51:03.715
You put all above yourself.
I know that of you, sir.

51:03.716 --> 51:06.715
You are the best of men.

51:06.716 --> 51:10.716
It is no happy accident
I came to you today.

51:12.716 --> 51:16.715
I...I know not what
the result of this will be,

51:16.716 --> 51:20.715
but there is knowledge
I must share with you.

51:20.716 --> 51:26.715
I...I... I should have said before,
long before, but you see,

51:26.716 --> 51:28.715
I...I saw him.

51:28.716 --> 51:35.716
I...I saw Inspector Shine
murder Sergeant Linklater.

51:39.716 --> 51:41.715
Detective Constable Flight!

51:41.716 --> 51:44.715
You will escort Mr Merrick
back to his rooms at The London.

51:44.716 --> 51:47.715
You remain outside his door,
and allow no man access

51:47.716 --> 51:48.715
unless it is myself.

51:48.716 --> 51:51.716
Yes, sir. Please, Mr Merrick.
Allow me.

51:59.716 --> 52:00.715
With me, Sergeant.

52:00.716 --> 52:04.716
We must bring Chief Inspector Abberline
here to hear Mr Merrick's testimony.

53:16.716 --> 53:18.716
How do, Mr Merrick.

53:22.716 --> 53:24.716
Why the long face?

53:26.716 --> 53:31.715
Could not do as you were bid,
could you?

53:31.716 --> 53:38.715
Are you not the brave
and noble fellow

53:38.716 --> 53:42.716
and I quite the contrary?

53:43.716 --> 53:49.715
Forced to make a habit
of stealing through these corridors

53:49.716 --> 53:53.716
to end another man's life.

53:55.716 --> 53:58.716
I might almost resent you for it.

54:15.716 --> 54:18.715
No, no.

54:18.716 --> 54:23.716
Please, please...

54:25.716 --> 54:27.716
What will men say?

54:29.716 --> 54:35.716
The Elephant Man hoped to lay down
in rest...

54:40.716 --> 54:43.716
..like any other Englishman.

54:51.716 --> 54:58.716
A forlorn and now tragic hope.

56:09.716 --> 56:12.716
He must have lain back.
To rest his head.

56:15.716 --> 56:16.716
Oh, Joseph.

56:17.716 --> 56:19.716
You have your peace now.

56:47.716 --> 56:49.715
What is this?

56:49.716 --> 56:50.715
You may well ask.

56:50.716 --> 56:53.715
I have, this past hour,

56:53.716 --> 56:58.715
come from the grieving fireside
of Frederick Treves.

56:58.716 --> 57:02.716
He is decided on what the Linklater
jury shall now hear from him.

57:04.716 --> 57:08.715
Your sergeant succumbed
to his injuries, Jedediah.

57:08.716 --> 57:10.715
I will not accept that, Fred.

57:10.716 --> 57:12.715
Myself likewise, Chief Inspector.

57:12.716 --> 57:15.716
Nonetheless, you shall both do so.

57:17.716 --> 57:23.715
There will be no more talk of this
officer and his role that night.

57:23.716 --> 57:26.715
And you, Edmund.

57:26.716 --> 57:28.715
You will cease all questioning

57:28.716 --> 57:32.715
and suspicion of Inspector Shine's
good name.

57:32.716 --> 57:34.715
You ask the impossible.

57:34.716 --> 57:37.715
You ask me
to wilfully fail in my duty.

57:37.716 --> 57:39.715
You are both too valuable

57:39.716 --> 57:42.715
to the preservation of peace
in this quarter.

57:42.716 --> 57:45.716
And I will not have that undermined.

57:48.716 --> 57:51.715
The two of you.

57:51.716 --> 57:53.716
You shake hands.

58:04.716 --> 58:05.716
Now!

58:15.716 --> 58:18.715
I take orders
from a man to come here.

58:18.716 --> 58:20.715
I service the needs of another
I call husband.

58:20.716 --> 58:23.715
And there is the man Duggan
who owns me.

58:23.716 --> 58:25.715
Reid, I swear to God
if anything happens to her...

58:25.716 --> 58:27.716
What is it you fear?
What is it you fear?

58:27.741 --> 58:34.646
