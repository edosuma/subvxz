WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:06.440
Wherefore art
thou new red lipstick?

00:06.540 --> 00:10.178
Deny thy pigment
and refuse thy gloss.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.346
(pops lips) It's matte.

00:12.446 --> 00:15.283
And we're clear.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.251
Excellent sketch, milady.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.320
You flatter me,
good sirrah.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.621
(both laugh)

00:20.721 --> 00:22.556
But in a professional,
dignified way

00:22.656 --> 00:24.658
that's totally appropriate
for two adult friends.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.861
(laughs):
Thou hast hit it.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.231
How you doing, kid?

00:30.331 --> 00:31.732
Any sign of your knees buckling?

00:31.832 --> 00:34.068
You want me to strap you
to a board like Hannibal Lecter?

00:34.168 --> 00:36.637
I'd say I'm good for someone
who recently realized

00:36.737 --> 00:38.206
she has feelings
for her best friend,

00:38.306 --> 00:39.507
but he just went
through a breakup

00:39.607 --> 00:40.841
and wants to focus
on our friendship,

00:40.941 --> 00:42.743
which she totally agrees
is the right call!

00:43.577 --> 00:46.080
Cool, you seem fine.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.615
(phone beeping)

00:47.715 --> 00:49.483
FREDDIE:
(groans) Make it stop.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.585
We get it,
an elder is in danger.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.222
Huh. No, it's just trying to get
me to do the next stupid update.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.256
Doesn't matter.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.890
(scoffs) Doesn't matter?

00:56.990 --> 01:00.261
The last update put the calendar
notifications on the bottom.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.196
Who knows
what they'll dream up next.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.465
(laughs)
You can't keep it together

01:04.565 --> 01:07.468
'cause of this ham sandwich?

01:07.568 --> 01:08.702
Okay, it's ready!

01:08.801 --> 01:11.439
Time to test
my latest sculpture.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.241
I call it-- mm--

01:13.341 --> 01:14.908
Memory Lane.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.113
-Ooh. (laughs)
-Thanks.

01:19.213 --> 01:22.515
(gasping, grunting)

01:23.317 --> 01:26.920
-Uh...
-Is this memory from
when you were blackout drunk?

01:27.788 --> 01:29.123
* I know *

01:29.223 --> 01:30.758
* You see *

01:30.858 --> 01:32.926
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

01:33.026 --> 01:35.996
* And be so wonderful *

01:36.096 --> 01:39.800
* So wake up
the members of my nation *

01:39.900 --> 01:42.002
* It's your time to be *

01:42.102 --> 01:45.005
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

01:45.104 --> 01:47.708
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

01:47.808 --> 01:51.011
* Of every situation *

01:51.110 --> 01:52.979
* Some things are meant to be *

01:53.080 --> 01:56.550
* So give your best
and leave the rest to me. *

02:01.121 --> 02:02.923
Live, damn you!

02:03.023 --> 02:05.526
Carly,
the surge killed your phone.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.261
It's time to let go.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.463
Fine.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.267
-Let's call it.
-It's okay.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.236
We'll go to the Pear Store,
and we'll get you a new phone.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.738
-I'm an honorary genius there.
-You get a discount?

02:17.838 --> 02:20.374
No, actually,
I pay a little more.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.443
Okay, I'll get my backup.

02:22.543 --> 02:26.247
Hey, h-have you guys seen
my hard drive?

02:26.347 --> 02:29.350
It has all my photos
from the last 15 years on it.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.719
It's purple with glitter,
and it's labeled

02:31.819 --> 02:34.588
"Carly's Bitchin'
Purple Hard Drive."

02:35.356 --> 02:36.890
(scoffs)

02:36.990 --> 02:40.861
Spencer, you used my actual
backups for your sculpture?

02:40.961 --> 02:43.430
Why couldn't you just use
an empty hard drive?

02:43.531 --> 02:47.768
If the hard drives were empty,
the meaning would be, too.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.804
Hey, you still have a backup
in the cloud, right?

02:50.904 --> 02:52.673
You know
I don't trust the cloud.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.242
How does it even work?

02:54.341 --> 02:55.942
You throw your phone in the sky
and wait for it to rain?

02:56.043 --> 03:00.448
Mm, that's an
oversimplification, probably.

03:01.815 --> 03:05.719
Oh, my God, it's really gone,
all of my photos.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.088
It's okay, it's okay.
We can fix this. We'll...

03:08.188 --> 03:09.357
recreate your memories.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.058
How?
Are you gonna give me amnesia

03:11.158 --> 03:14.328
so I can reexperience
everything for the first time?

03:14.428 --> 03:18.098
Wait. Did you already do that
and I already had this idea?

03:18.198 --> 03:22.002
No. We'll act out your favorite
moments and take new photos.

03:22.102 --> 03:26.874
Good sir, you would do
such a thing for me?

03:26.974 --> 03:31.545
Carly, I wouldst do anything
for thee, milady.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.046
My man. (laughs)

03:33.146 --> 03:34.615
Oh. Excelsior.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.083
Nonny Nonny. (laughs)

03:36.183 --> 03:37.251
Ooh, tell me.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.620
-Crumpet. (laughs)
-Ooh, for who?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.322
Oh, my God,
another blackout?

03:41.422 --> 03:45.393
No, I just needed that to stop.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.127
* Come on *

03:47.227 --> 03:49.363
* Yes, I can, yes, we can *

03:49.463 --> 03:52.199
* Watch us, we're unstoppable,
so clap your hands *

03:52.300 --> 03:54.968
-* Listen up. *
-(music stops)

03:55.067 --> 03:57.805
Excuse you!
Don't you knock?

03:57.905 --> 04:00.708
Literally not once in
the entire time you've known me.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.244
I don't want to alarm you,
but it's an emergency.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.513
Is it?

04:05.613 --> 04:07.448
You also said
it was an emergency

04:07.548 --> 04:09.450
when Queen Elizabeth
was trending.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.285
She died.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.587
And they replaced her
with some new guy.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.255
See? Everything is fine.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.728
Everything is not fine.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.831
I bought the first dress
I tried on.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.198
Can you believe it?

04:25.299 --> 04:26.767
Oh, I believe it.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.103
-So, you'll help?
-When a doctor sees a passenger

04:30.203 --> 04:31.605
on a plane
having a heart attack,

04:31.705 --> 04:33.474
do they have any choice
but to act?

04:33.574 --> 04:35.509
You think what you do
is like surgery?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.845
In some ways, it's harder.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.348
(sputters)

04:40.448 --> 04:43.250
Can I just ask... (laughs)

04:43.351 --> 04:45.353
"Naughty girl?"

04:45.453 --> 04:47.220
Isn't it so feminist?

04:47.321 --> 04:50.057
Yeah. What-what do you think
"feminist" means?

04:50.157 --> 04:54.495
(sighs) For years, I was
only seen as someone's mom,

04:54.595 --> 04:56.129
then someone's grandma.

04:56.229 --> 04:59.400
But with my Lewbie,
I'm my own magnificent,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.134
sexually empowered being.

05:01.234 --> 05:04.505
Finally... (deep inhale)
I'm Marissa.

05:04.605 --> 05:08.041
And Marissa is a naughty girl.

05:08.141 --> 05:12.212
Oh, damn. That's exactly
what feminist means.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.849
Well, what if we just gave you
some options?

05:15.949 --> 05:17.885
Ooh, that I can vote on?
(gasps)

05:17.985 --> 05:20.821
-Yeah.
-I'm like a suffragette.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.892
Focus.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.660
I'm worried
recreating these memories is

05:26.760 --> 05:28.596
just gonna make me want to kiss
Freddie on his big stupid face.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.765
I don't know why I called his
face stupid, I like it so much.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.301
You sure you don't want to
tell him how you feel?

05:34.402 --> 05:35.736
You'd be great together.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.571
No. I just want to
get through these memories

05:37.671 --> 05:39.272
with as little pain as possible.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.707
Then give me that list.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.843
Nope. Nope!

05:42.943 --> 05:45.879
The time you slow danced
at Nevel Papperman's wedding?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.515
Oh, my sweet Carly,

05:47.615 --> 05:50.683
so pure of heart,
so simple of mind.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.953
You need someone who can pick

05:53.053 --> 05:55.923
the most disgusting memories
of all time.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.126
Now you see why I came to you.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.130
All right, who's ready
to make some memories?!

06:03.230 --> 06:05.533
Okay.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.568
Carly, wake up!

06:07.668 --> 06:10.303
(both screaming)

06:10.404 --> 06:12.205
Did I really scare you?

06:12.305 --> 06:13.841
You could never scare me.

06:13.941 --> 06:17.411
Ah! Damn it, people,
back to one!

06:18.946 --> 06:20.514
Do we really need to
recreate the time

06:20.614 --> 06:23.216
my mom put cloud block on me
in front of the whole school?

06:23.316 --> 06:25.385
Yes, we do, Fredward.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.258
(groans) Pretty gross, huh?

06:32.359 --> 06:33.894
Disgusting.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.697
From the top, people!

06:39.967 --> 06:42.135
You can do better than this.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.706
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I said, "Better."

06:46.874 --> 06:48.909
I look like
I'm going to the Oscars.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.811
Too bad this is for my wedding.

06:52.546 --> 06:55.315
I get why the fans
like Baggles more than me.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.450
He's pretty cute.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.319
(groans) Still cute?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.755
(maniacal laughing)

07:02.856 --> 07:05.893
(chuckles) Adorable.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.296
I can't work
in these conditions!

07:11.098 --> 07:13.366
Are you ready to say wow
to the gown?

07:15.469 --> 07:16.937
She's the one.

07:20.373 --> 07:21.509
Yeah, work the trash.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.577
Be the trash.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.378
You are the trash.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.314
Wait, I'm the trash?

07:27.414 --> 07:28.882
You are not the trash.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.352
* Living without you... *

07:32.452 --> 07:35.756
Hey, wasn't this the song
that was playing when...

07:35.856 --> 07:38.692
When we slow danced here after
that terrible school dance?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.127
(chuckles):
Yeah.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.932
Would you maybe want to...

07:45.032 --> 07:47.067
you know,
just to get the photo.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.604
I guess, just for the photo.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.874
* And if you want my heart *

07:53.974 --> 07:57.578
* Just let me know *

07:57.678 --> 07:59.312
* 'Cause you were meant *

07:59.412 --> 08:01.582
* 'Cause you were meant
for me... *

08:01.682 --> 08:03.483
You know what I just realized?

08:03.584 --> 08:04.752
What?

08:05.553 --> 08:08.221
There's no one here
to take a picture.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.625
* *

08:11.725 --> 08:16.296
(rhythmically): No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:16.396 --> 08:17.531
No!

08:18.866 --> 08:21.535
* *

08:26.574 --> 08:28.842
I tried everything
I could think of.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.611
Some people don't want
to be helped.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.446
They just want to be
naughty girls.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.448
I never thought of my sister
that way,

08:35.549 --> 08:37.384
but I guess you're not wrong.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.620
Who gets the best
big brother award?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.254
(imitating air horn)

08:41.354 --> 08:43.890
-(chuckles)
-How can you...
(imitating air horn)

08:43.991 --> 08:45.125
at a time like this?

08:45.225 --> 08:46.493
When our plan was
a total failure?

08:46.594 --> 08:48.896
Exactly! Look,
forget the old plan.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.164
When Freddie called me trash
and asked me to dance,

08:51.264 --> 08:52.600
it opened the door a crack,

08:52.700 --> 08:54.602
and now
I am going to kick it down.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.136
So you're gonna tell Freddie
how you feel?

08:56.236 --> 08:57.504
Please, Harper.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.239
I'm giddy, not stupid.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.674
The ball's in Freddie's court.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.143
But if I set up
the perfect romantic memory,

09:03.243 --> 09:05.679
-he'll confess how he feels.
-SPENCER: Ooh!

09:05.779 --> 09:07.214
You could use
one of those memories

09:07.314 --> 09:08.682
I vetoed from your list!

09:09.349 --> 09:10.651
Don't ask me for help.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.352
I couldn't even get Mrs. B
to fall in love

09:12.452 --> 09:14.487
with a gown
by Pino Pino Firenze.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.424
(gasps) Firenze.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.860
Hello.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.762
I'm ready to recreate
the time I met Paul.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.496
New plan.
Take off the chicken suit,

09:23.597 --> 09:24.798
put on a regular suit,

09:24.898 --> 09:26.133
and meet me at Spencer's
in three hours.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.235
-What's the new memory?
-It's a surprise.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.170
Oh? A surprise?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.905
Yeah, a surprise.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.974
Ooh, surprise me.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.180
(door closes)

09:40.280 --> 09:41.682
Spencer, we have to
turn your apartment

09:41.782 --> 09:43.383
into a romantic café, pronto.

09:43.483 --> 09:46.253
We're gonna recreate the memory
of Freddie visiting me in Italy.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.922
Ah, you ruined the surprise.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.730
Finally, question 50.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.767
What is your favorite outfit
you've ever worn?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.969
Probably my nightgowns.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.471
They make me feel
so deliciously chaste.

10:04.571 --> 10:07.374
Like Stevie Nicks
in a convent.

10:07.474 --> 10:10.577
The landslide definitely
brought you down.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.614
According to this quiz,
your style icons are...

10:14.715 --> 10:17.017
Chrissy Teigen,
Angela Merkel,

10:17.117 --> 10:21.188
and the girl who crawls
out the TV in The Ring.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.956
I appreciate your help,

10:23.056 --> 10:25.125
but I already found
my dream gown.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.195
Plus, I was gonna keep this
a surprise,

10:28.295 --> 10:31.965
but I ordered the designer's
bridesmaids dresses, too.

10:32.065 --> 10:36.770
Harper, you're gonna be one of
my naughty girl-ettes!

10:37.971 --> 10:39.940
Perfect.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.811
Oh, no! My God, no.

10:43.911 --> 10:47.280
The son of the bride can't see
the dress before the wedding!

10:47.380 --> 10:49.082
Now what am I gonna wear?

10:49.182 --> 10:52.953
(yelling, crying)

10:53.954 --> 10:57.324
Freddie, my angel. (squeals)

10:57.424 --> 10:59.659
(grunts)

10:59.760 --> 11:02.629
Wow, I look really good
in this suit.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.799
Wait, did my mom's wedding dress
say "Naughty Girl"?

11:07.234 --> 11:08.468
* *

11:08.568 --> 11:10.570
(singing in Italian)

11:10.670 --> 11:12.840
Okay, let's go
through the plan.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.775
One, Freddie comes in

11:14.875 --> 11:17.177
and is obviously blown away
when he realizes

11:17.277 --> 11:20.547
we're recreating
our amazing night in Italy.

11:20.647 --> 11:23.283
Two, I mention
the adorable Italian grandpa

11:23.383 --> 11:25.152
that came up and asked
to take our picture.

11:25.252 --> 11:29.890
(Italian accent): Eh? Ah, look
at the beautiful young ones.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.759
You must let me take your photo.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.160
Say, "Cent'anni."

11:33.260 --> 11:34.361
(normal voice):
What does that mean again?

11:34.461 --> 11:35.562
Oh, it's an Italian toast.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.464
"May you live
for 100 years."

11:37.564 --> 11:39.165
Thank you. I plan to.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.934
Then you take our photo,

11:41.034 --> 11:43.136
and Freddie is overcome
with emotion,

11:43.236 --> 11:46.339
and then he confesses
his feelings, and...

11:46.439 --> 11:49.009
I don't know, doves, probably.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.679
-(knocking)
-Oh, my God, he's here.
It's him.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.148
E-Everything has to be perfect!

11:55.248 --> 11:57.184
This plate is dirty!

11:59.252 --> 12:00.954
Come in.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.992
Hey. (chuckles)
Nice suit.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.760
Wow, that dress.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.996
Do you remember
the night I wore it?

12:10.798 --> 12:12.900
(scoffs) Is this...

12:13.000 --> 12:14.667
From when you came to Italy.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.970
We got all dressed up
for that fancy dinner,

12:17.070 --> 12:18.505
but then
the restaurant was closed

12:18.605 --> 12:19.940
for the feast day
of Saint Geppetto,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.342
the patron saint of
little wooden boys.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.578
And then we took a walk
by the river,

12:25.678 --> 12:27.714
and we found that café,

12:27.815 --> 12:28.949
and that cute little
old man came up

12:29.049 --> 12:30.617
and asked to take our photo?

12:30.717 --> 12:33.653
(Italian accent): Eh? Ah, look
at the beautiful young ones.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.089
You must let me
take your photo.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.091
And I said,
"Say, parmigiana."

12:38.191 --> 12:41.361
-No. Here we say, "Cent'anni."
-(camera clicks)

12:41.461 --> 12:43.396
And I said, "That's perfect,

12:43.496 --> 12:45.799
"because I could live 100 years

12:45.899 --> 12:49.136
and never find
a friend like you."

12:49.937 --> 12:51.872
I can't believe you did this.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.241
Does that mean...

12:55.042 --> 12:58.578
I can't believe you recreated
the worst night of my life.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.948
Huh?

13:01.048 --> 13:03.984
That's not how it happened
at all.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.853
Right before you left for Italy,

13:05.953 --> 13:08.355
you kissed me, remember?

13:08.455 --> 13:09.622
Yeah.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.158
And after you moved,

13:11.258 --> 13:13.426
you were so lonely,
we talked for hours every day.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.229
And I planned that fancy dinner
because I was gonna ask you

13:16.329 --> 13:17.564
to be my girlfriend.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.599
What?

13:19.699 --> 13:21.268
But you never said that.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.670
Right,
'cause that old man came along.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.572
(Italian accent):
This old man? Ha!

13:25.672 --> 13:28.108
I sit down now. Scusi.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.145
He said, "Aw, look at
the beautiful couple."

13:32.245 --> 13:34.181
(sighs)

13:34.281 --> 13:35.582
And you laughed.

13:35.682 --> 13:39.252
You said, "No, definitely not
a couple.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.488
Friends. Amici."

13:42.255 --> 13:44.858
But you weren't upset.
You were fine.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.594
We ate gelato,
until that text.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.296
My family emergency?

13:49.396 --> 13:50.898
Yeah, I made that up.

13:50.998 --> 13:54.401
I slept at the airport
until I could get a flight home.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.103
You slept at the airport?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.506
And I swore I would never
let you string me along again.

13:59.606 --> 14:04.044
Freddie, I'm sorry,
but I did not string you along.

14:04.144 --> 14:07.114
You kissed me,
and then a month later,

14:07.214 --> 14:09.616
you laughed at the idea
of us being a couple.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.751
I laughed
because I was uncomfortable.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.320
You said that in 100 years,

14:13.420 --> 14:15.222
I could only ever be
your friend.

14:15.322 --> 14:19.026
I said that our friendship was
the most important of my life.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.929
That meant something to me.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.863
But, I guess to you,

14:23.964 --> 14:26.733
being my friend is just
a consolation prize.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.736
(Italian accent):
Oh, House of Gucci.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.239
That's not fair.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.641
No, it's not fair
that you made me the bad guy

14:34.741 --> 14:37.277
for all these years just
because I didn't like you back.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.580
If you didn't like me,
why did you kiss me?

14:40.680 --> 14:42.582
To give us closure.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.251
So we could both move on!

14:44.351 --> 14:47.988
Oh, well, gee.
Thank you for the closure.

14:48.088 --> 14:51.058
That was
awfully generous of you.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.026
Freddie!

14:56.496 --> 14:58.865
I-I can't believe this.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.201
* *

15:13.813 --> 15:17.617
Wow, you are hitting
the needle hard.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.021
-I'm making a scarf.
-Hmm.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.895
It should be longer, right?

15:29.829 --> 15:32.332
I regret walking into
this energy.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.635
Do you think that
I should just talk to Freddie?

15:35.735 --> 15:38.538
-Carly, you...
-I mean, I would send him
a funny meme to break the ice,

15:38.638 --> 15:40.273
but I don't have a phone.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.908
Would you print off "the girl in
front of a burning house" meme,

15:42.009 --> 15:44.177
so I could just
tape it to his door?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.812
Carly.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.680
But then it's, like, do I even
want to talk to Freddie?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.149
Maybe I'm still mad at Freddie.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.550
Or is how mad I am at Freddie
just because of

15:50.650 --> 15:52.352
-how much I like Freddie?
-Carly!

15:52.452 --> 15:53.920
Enough!

15:54.021 --> 15:57.157
Are you going to tell Freddie
you like him or not?

15:57.257 --> 15:58.891
He knows. He has to know.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.294
I mean, maybe I didn't say it
with literal words, but--

16:01.394 --> 16:03.796
(gasps) Oh, my God,
he might not know.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.733
Carly, if you want to be
with Freddie,

16:06.833 --> 16:09.402
you have to be an adult
and tell him how you feel.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.905
(baby voice):
But I'm a-scared.

16:13.006 --> 16:16.209
You will not be my best friend
and use that baby voice.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.079
(baby voice): Can I be
your second best friend?

16:19.179 --> 16:22.382
(normal voice):
Look, if I tell him how I feel,

16:22.482 --> 16:24.651
and he doesn't reciprocate...

16:24.751 --> 16:26.519
I mean, you saw
how bad I freaked out

16:26.619 --> 16:28.655
when I lost
pictures of Freddie.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.424
But to lose the actual person?

16:31.524 --> 16:33.360
I don't know
if I could handle that.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.163
Damn.
That's a good point.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.631
Maybe we are better as friends.

16:38.731 --> 16:42.069
It's so comfortable.
We just fit.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.271
Oh!

16:44.371 --> 16:45.505
Did you solve my problem?

16:45.605 --> 16:48.540
Better,
I solved my problem.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.944
I'm gonna be better about
asking what's going on with you.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.583
Do you want eggs
or something different?

16:56.683 --> 16:58.485
I want a lot of things
to be different.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.053
(door opens)

17:01.154 --> 17:04.491
Wow, you're still
in that dress.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.393
I can't wear it to my wedding,

17:06.492 --> 17:08.127
but at least I can get
my money's worth.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.363
It works for so many occasions.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.763
Name two.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.734
Out of the lucid nightmare
we all went through yesterday,

17:15.835 --> 17:17.770
I had a new idea for your dress.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.607
On your wedding day,
you want to feel beautiful

17:20.707 --> 17:24.544
but comfortable,
sexy but chaste.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.079
Exactly like...

17:27.180 --> 17:30.517
ALL:
Stevie Nicks in a convent
at a wedding!

17:30.617 --> 17:32.885
-(squealing)
-I love it.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.422
Are you ready to say wow
to the gown?

17:35.522 --> 17:36.689
That depends.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.891
Will you say wow
to designing the gown?

17:38.991 --> 17:40.760
Oh, I'll do it!

17:40.860 --> 17:43.396
But it's going to be
very expensive.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.731
That's okay.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.500
This naughty girl
is worth it.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.407
-Cappuccino?
-It's a flat white.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.609
(groans)

17:56.709 --> 17:58.745
Can nothing go right?!

18:00.580 --> 18:01.981
Is that your suit
from last night?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.417
I couldn't sleep,
so I took a walk.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.918
Finally passed out
on my couch

18:06.018 --> 18:08.288
after nine episodes
of Toledo House Flip.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.322
Oh, did they flip it?

18:09.422 --> 18:10.890
They always flip it.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.694
I keep going over last night.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.963
God, Carly planned
this beautiful moment.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.866
Technically,
Spencer did most of the work.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.002
And I ruined it.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.672
I got stuck in the past,
you know?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.174
How much it hurt
when we were kids

18:27.274 --> 18:29.676
and Carly rejected me.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.946
It was like there was
this huge sign-- "Just Friends."

18:35.915 --> 18:39.186
And I hate that
that made me so angry.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.522
Because I love being
Carly's friend.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.960
Have you talked to her today?
Is she okay?

18:48.060 --> 18:50.930
Honestly, last night
really freaked her out.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.300
She's worried you don't want
to be friends at all.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.701
What?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.069
I-I have to see her.
Is she home?

18:57.170 --> 18:59.172
She left a note for you
up in the studio.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.107
(exhales sharply)

19:07.146 --> 19:09.148
* *

19:09.249 --> 19:11.584
(door closes)

19:12.485 --> 19:13.853
How did you...

19:13.953 --> 19:17.224
I had Socko's cousin, Gizmo,
fix my hard drive.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.728
We've spent so much time on bad
memories the last couple days,

19:21.828 --> 19:24.431
I thought
we owed it to ourselves

19:24.531 --> 19:26.799
to look at some good ones.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.937
Oh, my God.
I could be my son.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.506
Don't you remember?

19:33.606 --> 19:36.209
That was the day
that you named iCarly.

19:36.309 --> 19:41.214
I, Internet. Carly, you.

19:41.314 --> 19:45.285
-But who else would've thought
to put them together?
-(laughs)

19:46.219 --> 19:49.188
You were the one who named
the show in the first place,

19:49.289 --> 19:53.192
and you were the one who told me
I could do it on my own.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.696
You jumped in front of
a taco truck to save my life.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.466
And then you said
we should wait to date

19:59.566 --> 20:03.135
until the whole "hero" thing
wore off, except...

20:04.437 --> 20:08.241
Freddie,
you're still my hero.

20:09.842 --> 20:13.112
You're the person
who I can always count on.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.182
You're the person
who makes me laugh,

20:16.283 --> 20:18.385
and you're the person
who pushes me to do the things

20:18.485 --> 20:21.688
that I need to do, even when
I really don't want to.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.756
Like updating your phone?

20:23.856 --> 20:25.325
Too soon, but yes.

20:26.426 --> 20:31.898
And since I've never
actually said it...

20:31.998 --> 20:34.233
and you deserve to hear it.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.736
And...

20:39.272 --> 20:40.373
Okay, good talk.

20:41.708 --> 20:42.942
Hey.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.078
You can do this.

20:49.048 --> 20:52.285
I like you, Freddie Benson.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.754
And I want to be with you.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.395
Carly, I need you to know...

21:05.432 --> 21:09.268
...being your friend
is not a consolation prize.

21:10.903 --> 21:14.106
It is the best thing
that I get to be.

21:17.009 --> 21:22.515
If we try this,
and it doesn't work...

21:22.615 --> 21:24.884
I can't lose you.

21:25.818 --> 21:31.090
I promise, no matter what,
you never will.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.429
Is this really happening?

21:36.529 --> 21:38.264
I hope so.

21:38.365 --> 21:41.434
It took us long enough.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.704
* *

21:51.978 --> 21:54.313
Ooh, let's do that again.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.182
In five, four...

21:56.282 --> 21:58.317

22:03.490 --> 22:05.124
A magnificent performance.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.293
Right up there with my work
as "brother/friend

22:07.394 --> 22:09.696
who convinces Freddie
that Carly doesn't like him."

22:09.796 --> 22:11.230
Milady.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.399
My man.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.933
-(both chuckle)
-Ew.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.702
We do not need to see that.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.704
Don't listen to the haters,
kids.

22:17.804 --> 22:20.072
We can all be naughty girls
together.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.073
(laughs)

22:21.173 --> 22:23.910
I don't want to kiss anymore.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.609
Ooh!
