00:02.160 --> 00:03.605
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.760 --> 00:07.207
The Travelers are about to make their move.
Their leader, Markos, is here.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.329
One by one, they've taken over towns...

00:09.520 --> 00:11.443
putting Passengers inside townsfolk.

00:11.640 --> 00:15.406
- I take it back. This is creepy.
- They're doing the same in Mystic Falls.

00:15.560 --> 00:17.369
You're passengered into the body
of a hybrid, Julian.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.966
They started the spell.
To make Julian permanent.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.330
Enzo's dead.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.284
I can bring you back. I'll find a way.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.451
- And how do you plan on doing that?
- Markos found his way. It's not impossible.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.369
The Other Side is falling apart.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.643
And when this place goes,
you are going with it.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.041
You asked if there was anything you
could do about the Other Side.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.929
Say goodbye to your friends, Bonnie.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.248
The blood of the final doppelgangers...

00:44.480 --> 00:47.211
can undo the curse that prevents
us from finding a home.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.442
We can break that curse.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.650
Wakey, wakey.

01:02.200 --> 01:07.047
Mr. Sikes, head of corporate accounts.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.887
Whoops. Sorry about that. Yeah.

01:12.080 --> 01:16.642
Can't have you mumbling any of those annoying
Traveler ditties. It's a sure migraine.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.283
Here's the deal. My brother and my girl
both have been kidnapped...

01:20.480 --> 01:23.290
by Travelers, and I can't seem
to find them anywhere.

01:23.520 --> 01:27.445
I mean, like, poof. Gone, right?

01:27.640 --> 01:33.841
So besides a clueless hybrid in my basement
and a cave full of sleeping Travelers...

01:34.040 --> 01:37.089
I've got nothing to go on except you.
So I'm gonna need you...

01:37.320 --> 01:39.846
to tell me where I can find
your leader, Markos.

01:41.480 --> 01:42.686
What's up, blondie?

01:43.640 --> 01:48.407
Liv and Luke aren't answering any of my...
Oh, my God. Mr. Sikes?

01:49.520 --> 01:53.161
- You know him?
- He helped me open my first savings account.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.045
- He gave me a lollipop.
- Well, unfortunately...

01:56.240 --> 01:59.528
Mr. Sikes here is occupied
by some lowlife Traveler.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.962
I saw him and his buddies chanting in the
town square last week. I also know...

02:05.520 --> 02:09.570
that Markos and your passengered comrades
are planning some big, flashy spell...

02:09.759 --> 02:13.401
to undo some super boring,
ancient witch curse.

02:14.240 --> 02:19.406
And where that sucks for us,
it just happens to undo all...

02:19.600 --> 02:25.004
witch magic, I.E., kill me and my
sexy blond frenemy here.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.685
If you know where Markos took
Stefan and Elena, you need to tell us.

02:31.920 --> 02:36.050
Yep, sorry.
You're gonna have to speak up.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.289
Mm, nope. Nope, didn't catch that, either.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.128
I think he's trying to say something.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.808
Come here, sweetie-pie.

02:54.240 --> 03:00.486
It doesn't matter where Markos is.
Nothing you do can stop him now.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.127
You have enough.

04:13.560 --> 04:14.686
Let me go.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.410
I'll have enough when
you can no longer speak.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.650
Who's there?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.962
Shh. Get out of here.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.484
Go.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.646
- Stefan?
- Elena.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.921
Seriously?
Collect calls are still a thing?

05:44.600 --> 05:47.968
You know what could've saved you the cost
of this call? You finding us.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.041
- How long have we been gone?
- Four <i>days.</i>

05:50.160 --> 05:52.606
Four days, and you couldn't track us down?

05:52.800 --> 05:56.771
- Did you think we were having a spa getaway?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. I've been searching 24/7.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.923
Maybe if you'd been more perceptive...

05:59.120 --> 06:01.521
you wouldn't have
gotten "doppel-napped."

06:03.960 --> 06:05.291
Oh.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.810
- What was that?
- Travelers drained us of our blood so...

06:09.000 --> 06:11.128
we've had to do a little hunting.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.891
You have Elena participating
in squirrel slaughter?

06:14.080 --> 06:16.128
She's no happier about it than I am.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.487
Mm-hm. She'll shoot your eye out.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.125
Do you want to talk to her?

06:20.320 --> 06:23.722
- Or pretending you don't want to hear her?
- Don't psychoanalyze me.

06:26.080 --> 06:29.209
- Where are you? <i>I'll</i> come get you.
- I have no idea where we are.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.563
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Listen, we'll make our way back...

06:32.760 --> 06:34.762
but Markos drained most of our blood.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.327
Considering the spells
he was able to do...

06:37.520 --> 06:39.409
<i>- ...with just</i> a <i>little...</i>
- Yeah, I <i>know.</i>

06:39.600 --> 06:44.128
Find Markos. Kill Markos. Save Mystic Falls
from becoming Traveler homeland.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.402
<i>It's gonna be a busy day for me, Stefan.</i>

06:46.600 --> 06:48.841
Time to strap on the hero hair.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.089
<i>- I'll</i> get her home safely.
- Get both...

06:51.280 --> 06:54.682
yourselves home safely.
I'd hate to kick her ass for losing you.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.527
- God!
- Forgetting someone?

07:02.400 --> 07:03.811
Bonnie!

07:04.000 --> 07:05.968
He says you promised
to bring him back.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.960
Uh, you're paraphrasing. He said, quote,
"I will find a way."

07:10.160 --> 07:12.162
- Whatever.
- Hello, still here.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.885
And I know what I said.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.805
Remind him he doesn't have a
good record for promises.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.331
Please stop talking.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.569
The Other Side is on the brink of collapse.
I plan on pestering you...

07:21.760 --> 07:26.527
- ...until I'm returned to the land of the living.
- You need to fix this, before I lose my mind.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.690
Hey, I'm sorry.
I've got two missing doppelgangers.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.685
I've got a Traveler that wants
to rid our town of magic...

07:32.880 --> 07:34.723
and the friendly banker Mr. Sikes...

07:34.920 --> 07:39.130
in the coat closet. So escape from the
netherworld will have to wait till tomorrow.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.651
I think he wants to be penciled
in for today.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.446
- Then you bring him back.
- What?

07:49.880 --> 07:52.565
Liv is cooking up a spell
to pull you back...

07:52.760 --> 07:57.721
from the Other Side before it goes kaboom. So
whatever you're doing, include Enzo in it.

07:58.600 --> 08:04.369
You hear me, Enzo? Just hitch a ride with her.
Okay? See? There.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.451
- Delegating. I feel better.
- That's not a great idea.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.050
- You called?
- You.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.925
I need you and your Xbox buddy to
run an errand for me.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.928
Come on, let's go.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.325
Well? What are you waiting for? Ring up your
little witchy friend and get her over here.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.847
- God, I feel like an idiot.
- Ditto.

08:41.320 --> 08:46.929
- Do that thing again. The vamp thing.
- I don't want to do that. It's embarrassing.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.600
Come on, it's the only thing
keeping me sane now.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.081
Sure.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.287
Ha.

08:56.840 --> 09:01.323
- That was funnier the first time.
- You were delirious the first time.

09:01.840 --> 09:07.722
How many, ahem, you know, are we supposed
to have before we get our strength back?

09:07.920 --> 09:12.050
More than we've had, that's for sure.
Let me know if you see a damned buffalo.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.123
- This is depressing.
- Yeah.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.523
More depressing than walking miles,
not knowing where you're going?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.961
No, probably not more
depressing than that.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.409
Damon is in full hero mode today.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.330
- I'm sure he was thrilled about that.
- I don't know.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.364
He had that whole
savior-of-the-universe voice going on.

09:31.520 --> 09:37.562
Heh. I like that voice.
Maybe this whole thing is a sign.

09:38.360 --> 09:43.207
- A sign of what?
- My blood can literally destroy him.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.806
If that's not a sign
we're in a toxic relationship...

09:46.000 --> 09:49.129
Our blood, all right? Don't hog the blame.

09:51.040 --> 09:56.171
We're vampires. We're a toxic species. Whether
you want to blame magic or biology...

09:56.400 --> 09:57.686
this is who we are.

09:57.880 --> 10:02.761
When a human gets ravenously hungry, they
eat a double cheeseburger. We kill people.

10:02.960 --> 10:07.045
Some of us are more extreme than others,
but that's just who we are.

10:07.880 --> 10:13.125
- How come you're better at controlling that?
- Because I'm so much worse when I don't.

10:13.920 --> 10:18.323
I'm only gonna say this once.
You two are miserable without each other.

10:18.520 --> 10:21.444
So if you want to be with him,
just be with him.

10:21.680 --> 10:25.969
When humans want to break free from complicated
relationships, they go to therapy.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.926
Vampires get a pass, okay?

10:32.440 --> 10:33.771
Come on.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.403
I ordered waffles. I figured our
last meal wouldn't be complete...

10:47.600 --> 10:52.367
- ...until we poured liquid sugar all over it.
- Hmm. My ray-of-sunshine sister.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.328
The coven's pissed, Luke.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.490
You were supposed to hide Stefan and Elena
from the Travelers...

10:58.680 --> 11:01.524
and you practically delivered them
on a silver platter.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.162
How was I supposed to know Casper
the English Ghost would be a complication?

11:05.360 --> 11:08.807
That's not the point. We were never
supposed to let things get this far.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.201
We got sucked into some stupid
let's-be-friends trap...

11:13.440 --> 11:18.128
These people are nice. More than I
can say for our screwed-up family.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.489
- What are you doing?
- It's not me.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.324
- Like I said, the coven is pissed.
- Fine. I'm listening.

11:32.160 --> 11:36.370
We were supposed to keep the doppelgangers
from falling into Markos' hands.

11:36.560 --> 11:41.771
We failed. We can't let him succeed
at taking away our magic.

11:42.160 --> 11:46.961
There's only one move left.
We have to kill Stefan and Elena.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.049
Yeah.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.770
- Morning, Sam.
- Mrs. Douglas. Special delivery.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.770
- The mailman didn't deliver anything?
- Nope, just picking up.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.362
I'm gonna be late for school.
Got a million college essays to review.

12:21.560 --> 12:25.201
What's going on, Pam? Something's wrong.
You're different lately.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.883
I think what's wrong is that it's
taken you so long to notice...

12:30.080 --> 12:32.731
your wife has been colonized
by a total stranger.

12:32.880 --> 12:38.046
- You think I'm joking? I'm serious.
- So am I. My name's Karl.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.567
I'm a Traveler living inside
your wife while...

12:40.720 --> 12:42.848
my body is asleep in a cave
under the town.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.362
- What are you talking about?
- This isn't my first choice...

12:46.560 --> 12:49.848
but I needed to borrow something
that's expendable.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.650
Pam, you need help.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.121
This marriage was a disaster anyway.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.562
No hard feelings.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.769
- I think I just hallucinated a unicorn.
- Mm.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.888
- Maybe Caroline's nearby.
- Heh.

13:21.040 --> 13:24.726
If Caroline was here, we'd have a fully
catered buffet on the side of the road.

13:24.920 --> 13:28.083
- And a rainbow.
- Two rainbows.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.682
Heh. That's funny.

13:32.760 --> 13:36.731
When we were younger, I couldn't decide
what was more annoying...

13:36.960 --> 13:41.602
her control-freakiness
or her delusional positivity.

13:42.200 --> 13:46.444
Right now, honestly, there isn't a single
person I wish was here more.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.406
- Her control-freakiness never bugged me.
- Yeah, well, you didn't have to build...

13:50.640 --> 13:53.849
- ...a Barbie castle with her in second grade.
- True.

13:54.040 --> 14:00.685
I do know this. If Caroline Forbes was here
right now, we'd both be laughing.

14:02.480 --> 14:06.041
We're so pathetic.
You know what?

14:06.800 --> 14:10.441
Let's put on our best
Caroline-Forbes hats, shall we?

14:10.640 --> 14:16.363
All right, universe. Enough screwing around.
We're ready for the good stuff.

14:16.560 --> 14:21.043
Theme dance or a block party, maybe?

14:21.640 --> 14:24.530
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- What?

14:25.160 --> 14:26.446
Oh, my God.

14:26.640 --> 14:30.440
That is so weird. Oh, no. Wait.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.685
- See?
- Right.

14:46.960 --> 14:51.010
Hi... Oh, not what I was expecting.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.961
All right, let's cut to the chase.
You're giving us a ride.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.841
You're trying to compel me?
Who do you think freed you last night?

15:02.680 --> 15:04.887
Get in. They're coming for you.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.363
Oh, great.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.762
I'm gonna add "carry" to the list of things
that you can't do well.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.089
That's okay, you can pay me back
with your salary from the Grill.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.442
If you want to work a
couple thousand years.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.200
Won't you do us a favor and
start dating Elena again?

15:21.360 --> 15:23.203
Just put her on the pool table.

15:24.040 --> 15:27.010
What the hell is going on?
Who are all these people?

15:27.200 --> 15:29.885
Traveler husks.
They've passengered themselves...

15:30.080 --> 15:33.926
into the beautiful citizens of Mystic
Falls, like your buddy, Mr. Sikes.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.362
You two make yourselves useful.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.246
Patrol the town. Call if you see
anything weirder than usual.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.971
And what are you planning on doing
with all of them?

15:43.160 --> 15:48.041
Here you go. Oh, yeah.
Well, Markos put them in a cave.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.050
I'm hoping he wants them back.

15:51.240 --> 15:54.369
So you think drawing Markos to
your house is the best idea?

15:54.560 --> 15:56.767
It's the only idea...

15:56.920 --> 16:00.083
unless your body-snatched ex-boyfriend
in the basement can help.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.769
Julian is not Tyler, therefore he has
no reason to help us.

16:04.960 --> 16:08.248
So until I figure out a way to get
Tyler back, he's just extra baggage.

16:08.480 --> 16:13.008
There's no shame in giving up. I mean,
aren't we all a little sick of Tyler?

16:14.440 --> 16:15.601
You know what?

16:15.800 --> 16:19.691
Your whole "I'm-too-cool-to-care"
thing is really starting to get old.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.411
Don't think for one second that I believe
your mood has nothing to do with Elena.

16:25.480 --> 16:30.008
- Spare me the unsolicited relationship advice.
- Fine. Keep your torture-happy hands off Tyler...

16:30.200 --> 16:35.161
until I figure something out. I don't
abandon the people that I care about.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.602
It was too risky to haul you out myself,
so I had to circle back.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.802
Won't they kill you for helping us out?

16:46.960 --> 16:50.328
Yes. We need to make sure they don't get me
before I get to my husband.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.891
I assume you know where he is?

16:52.080 --> 16:56.165
Seeing as how he's permanently passengered
into one of our best friends, yeah.

16:57.640 --> 17:02.328
- This isn't a three-person kind of truck, is it?
- You can always sit on your boyfriend's lap.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.686
- We're not together.
- She's not my girlfriend.

17:04.880 --> 17:09.169
Noted. Sorry, I assumed the doppelgangers
were fated soul mates, or something.

17:10.319 --> 17:15.486
- Something like that.
- So you want your husband back, I get it.

17:16.319 --> 17:19.608
But didn't he run from Markos too?
Doesn't that make you both dead?

17:19.839 --> 17:22.411
Markos is focused on breaking
the curse so Travelers...

17:22.640 --> 17:25.644
can settle permanently in your town.
I'll have a head start...

17:25.839 --> 17:29.447
- ...if I get to Julian before the spell.
- We're not gonna let you take Tyler.

17:29.640 --> 17:33.486
Tyler is gone. There's only Julian now,
and he belongs with me.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.650
Once the spell starts, magic will be
stripped layer by layer.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.890
Tyler's body will turn from hybrid back to
werewolf. Then finally he'll just be dead.

17:41.120 --> 17:47.127
And my husband along with him.
So leaving him behind is not an option.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.121
Quit hovering. It's weird.

17:56.560 --> 18:01.168
You're permanently inhabiting the former love of my life.
Let's debate the levels of weird.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.647
If he's "former," why do you care?

18:03.880 --> 18:07.680
Because he's a person whose life
you stole without asking.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.406
- He deserves to be fought for.
- Whatever.

18:14.520 --> 18:18.923
So why can't Markos and all the other
Travelers find someplace to live?

18:20.240 --> 18:26.691
It's nice here. It's not just breaking the curse
that keeps us from being able to settle...

18:27.280 --> 18:30.409
it's revenge against everything
the witches stand for.

18:30.560 --> 18:35.009
Every grimoire, every talisman, every
vampire, right down to your daylight rings.

18:37.400 --> 18:41.485
The Travelers see it all as a perversion
of pure magic.

18:41.720 --> 18:46.009
Markos wants to destroy that perversion.
He wants to restore the balance.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.851
But that's just wrong.

18:49.040 --> 18:53.921
It's not really wrong, when you think about it.
If anything, it's kind of right.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.449
Why does he have to be so violent?

18:58.920 --> 19:01.366
When it comes to getting
what he wants...

19:01.560 --> 19:04.131
Markos doesn't have much of
a sense of humor.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.291
Nothing.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.722
Ah.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.409
Salvatore boring house.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.491
<i>- I'm calling about my people.
- Hey. You</i> found my <i>note.</i>

19:54.720 --> 20:00.887
Listen, don't be offended, but I can't just give
them to anyone. So, what do they look like?

20:01.080 --> 20:04.641
<i>They're ragged. Beaten down
by the world. Desperate for</i> a <i>home.</i>

20:04.840 --> 20:07.810
You described homeless people,
aging hipsters, and Matt Donovan.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.527
<i>One of them is 5'10", wearing a black coat.
You're standing next to him.</i>

20:18.200 --> 20:24.810
I know the concept of a home is new to you,
but it is polite to knock.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.200
So Julian is trapped
inside of Tyler forever.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.529
Or until he dies. So I was thinking...

20:31.720 --> 20:36.681
what if he does die? Maybe that's how
we do it. That's how we get him out.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.445
You want to kill Tyler?

20:38.640 --> 20:40.961
He'll go to the Other Side. When Liv...

20:41.160 --> 20:44.562
does her spell to help you and Enzo,
Tyler can come back.

20:46.680 --> 20:52.050
And, speaking of, shouldn't you be, like,
preparing or talking to Liv...

20:52.240 --> 20:55.050
or doing anything other than
packing up our dorm room?

20:55.240 --> 20:58.722
We have to be out of here right
after finals which I might skip...

20:58.920 --> 21:03.403
due to the potential extinction of magic in the
place where I was spending my summer break.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.683
Right, but I think the Other Side
falling apart...

21:06.880 --> 21:09.565
is slightly more pressing
than a late housing fee.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.364
There is no spell.

21:15.600 --> 21:21.084
I made it up. The Other Side is collapsing
and everyone in it, including me...

21:21.240 --> 21:24.323
is going away, for good.

21:24.560 --> 21:28.565
So no.
I don't think you should kill Tyler.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.930
Nice place. A little rustic.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.806
My tastes are more modern, ironically.
Still...

21:40.120 --> 21:45.001
- Good bones and all.
- I think you read the flyer wrong.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.210
The bodies are the only thing
on the bargaining table.

21:48.400 --> 21:52.928
- And in the attic and the garage and kitchen.
- About that...

21:53.160 --> 21:58.530
Please tell me taking hostages isn't your
grand plan, because it feels a little small.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.883
- Much like the half bathroom off the foyer.
- Funny.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.361
Here I thought you didn't have
a sense of humor.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.806
Hmm.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.285
Oh, if you're wondering about the smell...

22:10.480 --> 22:13.962
I have your salvation army
doused in gasoline...

22:14.160 --> 22:16.367
and I am just itching
to light a match.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.925
Hmm.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.640
You're right. None of this would be
possible without their willingness to...

22:22.840 --> 22:27.687
passenger themselves into your citizens
and help perform my spell.

22:28.720 --> 22:33.169
While I'd like to give them the opportunity
to return to their actual bodies...

22:38.360 --> 22:40.647
it's not essential to my plan.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.968
Did you really think you found
the whole of my people?

22:46.160 --> 22:50.085
Travelers are everywhere.

22:50.280 --> 22:55.241
They're the faces that surround you every
day, the world over, ones you don't notice...

22:55.840 --> 22:59.162
because you're too busy
making a mess of all that you have.

22:59.360 --> 23:04.207
And they want those things too.
A home, a family, a better life.

23:06.040 --> 23:11.683
- And they're willing to die for it.
- You want a promised land. I get it. Okay?

23:11.840 --> 23:16.880
But off the record, I mean,
Mystic Falls is kind of a dump.

23:17.120 --> 23:21.205
Bad schools, terrible traffic. Forget about
ever getting a decent cup of coffee. Heh.

23:21.400 --> 23:26.281
Mystic Falls is a means to an end,
like a small pebble...

23:26.480 --> 23:32.567
- ...dropped into a very large pond.
- Very poetic. No idea what it means.

23:34.080 --> 23:38.244
Once we destroy the spirit magic in this town,
the witches' curse will finally be broken.

23:38.440 --> 23:44.925
From there, the spell will ripple outward,
unraveling spirit magic as it spreads.

23:45.920 --> 23:49.720
Only pure magic, our magic, will remain.

23:50.280 --> 23:53.170
My people will be free to go wherever.
And when witch magic...

23:53.360 --> 23:59.083
and all that it has ever created is gone
from this earth, you will be too.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.851
I think I've heard about enough.

24:09.240 --> 24:15.122
You underestimate me. I've completely
transfused myself with doppelganger blood.

24:15.320 --> 24:21.009
I'm channeling all the power of my people.
You're not strong enough to kill me anymore.

24:23.080 --> 24:26.971
Not that it matters.
The spell has already begun.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.851
Home sweet home.

24:54.160 --> 25:00.691
I don't mean to be rude, but would you mind
if I drained your carotid of a few ounces?

25:01.360 --> 25:05.684
You're two blocks from home. Would you mind
holding out, considering I saved your lives?

25:10.320 --> 25:14.803
Word of advice, keep a low profile. This is
exactly where Markos doesn't want you to be.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.725
If the Travelers spot you,
you're going right back to camp...

25:17.920 --> 25:19.410
- Look out!
- Aah!

25:25.200 --> 25:27.487
- What the hell is she doing?
- Trying to kill you.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.205
Just a wild guess.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.367
Get out of the car.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.042
- Unlock the doors.
- I did!

25:48.880 --> 25:50.723
- Stop!
- I can't!

26:03.800 --> 26:05.882
Oh, my God.

26:20.040 --> 26:23.931
I'm sorry, I really am. But we need to make
the doppelganger blood useless.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.451
One of you needs to die.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.088
Doesn't matter which one, really.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.970
When did you plan on telling me?

26:36.160 --> 26:39.881
Or were you hoping the darkness would
take me before the awful truth came out?

26:40.920 --> 26:43.127
- Answer me.
- Don't you get it?

26:43.320 --> 26:45.891
- There is no solution.
- There's always a solution.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.805
Your boyfriend came back from the dead.
Markos came back...

26:49.000 --> 26:52.243
- ...you came back from the dead.
- Travelers used doppelganger blood...

26:52.440 --> 26:55.922
in the spell to bring Markos back.
They basically destroyed the magic...

26:56.120 --> 26:58.805
holding the Other Side together.
It's unraveling.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.764
There is nothing anyone can do to stop it.

27:00.960 --> 27:06.729
It's over, Enzo. You're not coming back.
Accept it.

27:06.920 --> 27:11.642
I will accept it when that darkness comes
and yanks me into oblivion.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.081
I will accept it when I no longer exist.

27:14.840 --> 27:19.607
I spent over 50 years stuck in a cell.
Poked, prodded, tortured.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.644
By all rights, I had no hope
of getting out.

27:22.840 --> 27:29.724
But I clung to it. So I will accept it
when it's done. No minute prior.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.602
I know you.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.562
You tried to kill my boyfriend
in the caves.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.370
- What's going on?
- A Traveler just died.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.604
Please tell my husband I tried.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.282
<i>When I was 8 years old
I smoked a cigarette</i>

28:06.440 --> 28:08.408
<i>I didn't know it came from a factory</i>

28:08.560 --> 28:13.009
I'd invite you to stay for dinner, but I'm
not very familiar with Traveler cuisine.

28:13.200 --> 28:17.410
Although I'm sure it involves
lots of trail mix and gruel.

28:17.600 --> 28:22.322
I think I'll take this wall down.
I love an open floor plan.

28:22.520 --> 28:28.004
Damon. He doesn't know I'm here.
Use the element of surprise.

28:28.200 --> 28:32.364
Not sure you're clever enough to pull it
off, just thought I'd put it out there.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.483
All I ask is that you leave me
with a couple bottles of wine.

28:37.680 --> 28:43.961
I've spent half my life shoplifting the stuff.
I'm assuming you want to see the wine cellar.

28:46.320 --> 28:49.927
Ah. Here's something you don't
see every day.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.402
I think I won this in a poker game.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.370
Maybe Stefan brought it back from the war.
Don't remember.

28:58.560 --> 29:01.484
Where is your brother?
I was hoping he'd be here.

29:01.680 --> 29:05.082
The doppelgangers seemed to have
slipped away without saying goodbye.

29:05.280 --> 29:08.090
That's a good question.
Why don't we find out?

29:10.200 --> 29:11.964
After you.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.770
Do it, Liv, come on.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.684
No hard feelings.
Just following our coven's orders.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.727
Liv! Liv, what's happening?

29:47.880 --> 29:49.530
Oh, no.

29:52.800 --> 29:57.044
- Your magic sputter out?
- Luke, it's started. The spell's started.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.531
We trusted you.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.611
It doesn't matter.
You're gonna be dead any second.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.244
- Elena?
- Stefan, our rings aren't working.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.410
Get inside. Run, now!

30:42.360 --> 30:44.362
Elena, hey, what happened?

30:45.080 --> 30:47.367
- Our rings aren't working.
- What?

30:47.520 --> 30:49.801
Whole town square is filled with Travelers.
Gotta get out.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.241
The tunnels. Through the stock room.
Come on.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.247
Elena?

31:31.080 --> 31:33.924
- What's going on?
- The spell unravels the witches' magic.

31:34.200 --> 31:37.921
It's spreading and, without the magic,
I'm just someone who was shot by his dad.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.891
Let's keep running.
Maybe we'll stay ahead of it.

31:42.720 --> 31:48.523
Well, Stefan isn't picking up.
He might just be out of cell phone minutes.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.962
What kind of game are you playing?

31:58.040 --> 31:59.371
Took you long enough.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.690
My fangs.
What the hell happened to my fangs?

32:06.880 --> 32:08.120
What?

32:11.240 --> 32:12.526
Ooh.

32:21.080 --> 32:22.320
We have a problem.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.364
What were you saying about
this being your home?

33:01.360 --> 33:03.727
- No.
- Unh.

33:06.960 --> 33:12.649
Like I said, the spell will continue
to unravel spirit magic as it spreads.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.884
Which means you're not long
for this world.

33:20.040 --> 33:26.082
The sun's about to set. Feel free to buy
yourself a little time to say your goodbyes.

33:26.320 --> 33:31.929
You and this traitor of yours can try to
outrun the spell. For a little while anyway.

34:10.960 --> 34:14.646
Little Gilbert, I have never been
so happy to see you.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.246
Get in.

34:18.440 --> 34:22.684
I mean, what are we even supposed take?
Photos, clothes, hair products?

34:22.880 --> 34:27.522
Like any of that matters when we're all dead.
Why are you just sitting there?

34:27.719 --> 34:29.404
I'm thinking.

34:30.719 --> 34:34.281
Well, think while you pack.
Death is literally on its way.

34:34.480 --> 34:38.087
You said a vampire appeared to you
who died on Old Miller Road.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.967
The spell's spreading past Mystic Falls.
So whatever will fit.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.924
The rest, we'll never see again.

34:44.440 --> 34:48.047
Hello, Bonnie? Which part of
"we're all about to die" isn't registering?

34:48.239 --> 34:50.607
I think I know how to get us back
from the Other Side.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.440
I need to find Enzo.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.245
- These are all the blood bags I could get.
- Thanks.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.084
- Between the four of us, that'll last a day.
- Then what?

35:06.280 --> 35:09.011
That's a tomorrow problem.
Now we gotta outrun the spell...

35:09.200 --> 35:12.044
regroup in a thousand miles
and figure out a game plan.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.250
You okay?

35:36.880 --> 35:42.887
- What was that for?
- I had a really crappy day, and I needed it.

35:44.200 --> 35:49.730
I thought I was never gonna see you again,
and I couldn't think of a worse way to die.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.321
Well, I guess today is your lucky day.

35:56.080 --> 35:59.527
Jeremy, head back with Matt.
We need eyes and ears in Mystic Falls.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.162
You take Jeremy's car.
I'm gonna wait for Caroline and Bonnie.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.880
<i>- I'll</i> call you in a few hours, Jer.
- Be careful.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.691
Surreal, isn't it?

36:32.440 --> 36:36.081
- Who are you?
- Dead, just like you.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.567
I've got a proposition
to get us out this place.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.404
What are you talking about?

36:41.600 --> 36:44.331
Markos managed to Houdini back
to the land of the living...

36:44.520 --> 36:47.763
- ...with some spell. Any chance you know it?
- I know the spell...

36:47.960 --> 36:51.407
but I don't know two dozen Travelers
willing to overwhelm the Anchor.

36:51.640 --> 36:55.486
I think you underestimate how resourceful
we are. Just leave the details to us.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.364
What do you say? Interested?

37:04.760 --> 37:07.684
- What the hell is happening?
- Grab my hand.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.728
- Help! Help me!
- Hold on.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.406
Don't let go!

37:21.680 --> 37:23.250
No.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.531
What's wrong?

37:43.160 --> 37:45.003
We hit a little snag.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.884
Where's Bonnie? She was behind me.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.009
I'm gonna find out what's taking so long.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.647
I'm looking for Maria.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.764
I heard she brought you
back to Mystic Falls.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.970
- Uh, yeah, she did.
- Did she tell you where she was headed?

37:59.160 --> 38:01.561
She can't stay there.
The town's completely overrun.

38:04.400 --> 38:07.404
What's the problem?
Did she tell you where she was headed?

38:08.200 --> 38:11.886
Listen, uh, you're not
gonna see Maria again.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.889
What are you talking about?

38:18.920 --> 38:20.001
She's dead.

38:22.720 --> 38:25.530
- I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.

38:25.720 --> 38:29.167
- It wasn't Stefan's fault.
- She saved your punk ass.

38:29.360 --> 38:30.885
I wasn't the one who killed her.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.929
Someone's gonna pay for it.

38:33.160 --> 38:37.165
Hey, I'm in no mood to fight tonight,
all right?

38:38.880 --> 38:43.283
Look at me. My wife's dead.
I'm in somebody else's body.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.370
I've got nowhere to go.
My own people are trying to kill me.

38:46.560 --> 38:50.565
We're gonna stop this spell. If Mystic
Falls is gone, we're gonna save ourselves.

39:08.440 --> 39:11.171
There. Dead doppelganger...

39:11.320 --> 39:12.890
stopped the spell.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.924
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

39:20.440 --> 39:22.090
Oh, no, no, no!

39:23.520 --> 39:25.045
Oh, my God.

39:25.240 --> 39:30.406
What the hell happened? Maria was the only
one willing to help us who knew that spell.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.410
The great beyond happened,
and it's going to keep happening.

39:33.640 --> 39:36.041
We need to find a way out of here, fast.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.691
Stefan?

39:43.440 --> 39:44.601
What?

39:47.480 --> 39:48.970
Bonnie?

39:51.320 --> 39:54.324
- This can't be happening.
- Please, tell me...

39:54.520 --> 39:57.490
that you figured a way
to bring us all back.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.286
I lost it.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.727
I'm sorry.

40:18.280 --> 40:23.286
God, help me! Please! Oh, my God.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.682
Somebody help!

40:29.840 --> 40:32.730
Somebody! Help!
