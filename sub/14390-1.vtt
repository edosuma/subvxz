02:50.228 --> 02:51.428
The Duke!

02:51.529 --> 02:54.722
Last time was at the Olympia in 1958.

02:55.416 --> 02:58.221
Thanks for the invitation.

02:59.088 --> 03:01.473
But what is this?

03:02.032 --> 03:05.725
This isn't Duke Ellington.
It's Duck Ellington!

03:13.919 --> 03:16.207
What?

03:41.853 --> 03:43.184
Here.

03:43.354 --> 03:44.753
Here's fine.

04:20.190 --> 04:23.820
Calm down!
You'll knock my door down! What do you want?

04:24.061 --> 04:25.050
Mme Miroux?

04:25.129 --> 04:26.824
No, she's not here anymore.

04:27.031 --> 04:28.157
But I...

04:29.133 --> 04:30.862
That door won't last!

04:31.035 --> 04:32.366
I... Stéphane...

04:34.071 --> 04:36.032
Stéphane, is that you?

04:36.133 --> 04:37.233
Ivana?

04:37.234 --> 04:38.234
Yes

04:38.643 --> 04:40.008
You've returned!

04:40.344 --> 04:42.005
Let me look at you.

04:42.180 --> 04:45.377
Oh, those eyes!
You're almost a man now.

04:45.550 --> 04:47.609
Let me help. I have your keys...

04:47.785 --> 04:49.412
Your poor father...

04:49.587 --> 04:52.954
I hope we'll see
more of your mother now.

04:53.591 --> 04:55.786
See? Nothing's changed.

04:57.695 --> 04:59.060
Here we are.

04:59.597 --> 05:01.224
Do you recognise it?

05:02.099 --> 05:04.727
I'm glad someone will live here.

05:06.237 --> 05:07.898
You have a message.

05:08.206 --> 05:10.504
Your mom should see to the mail.

05:13.404 --> 05:17.640
<i>Hi honey, sorry I couldn't pick you up.
Gérard was sick all night.</i>

05:18.549 --> 05:21.712
<i>Here's the address
for your job tomorrow.</i>

05:21.886 --> 05:24.411
<i>At 10 a. m. see Mr Pouchet...</i>

05:24.589 --> 05:26.853
<i>...at the Latreille company.</i>

05:27.258 --> 05:29.317
They're a good firm.

05:29.727 --> 05:32.457
<i>30 Rue de Marseille, metro République.</i>

05:32.630 --> 05:35.064
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

05:35.466 --> 05:36.865
What will you be doing exactly?

05:37.868 --> 05:40.029
- Illustrations.
- For calenders?

05:40.204 --> 05:42.069
Yes. Wanna see?

05:42.198 --> 05:45.239
No time.
I have to clean the stairs.

05:45.409 --> 05:47.274
I'll leave you to it. Bye.

05:47.445 --> 05:49.743
Goodbye. Thanks.

05:49.947 --> 05:52.780
Oh, I can't believe you're back!

07:58.843 --> 08:00.037
Stéphane...

08:00.211 --> 08:04.739
...it's your first day here.
You have to choose sides.

08:04.915 --> 08:07.975
So, two possibilities: a couple of fags.

08:08.152 --> 08:11.644
How can we be gay
if we're opposite sexes?

08:11.822 --> 08:13.687
A matter of mentality.

08:13.858 --> 08:16.753
And me, Guy, ex-battleship salesman...

08:16.927 --> 08:18.918
...filmsetter and ladykiller.

08:19.096 --> 08:20.893
I'll show you the ropes.

08:21.065 --> 08:23.124
I can do that too.

08:23.734 --> 08:25.998
I'm Martine. I'm in charge of the office committee...

08:26.170 --> 08:30.607
...and the very popular ski weekend.

08:30.775 --> 08:32.833
Serge, Martine's assistant.

08:33.010 --> 08:37.777
The ski weekend is excellent
for team spirit.

08:38.678 --> 08:39.678
Ski?

08:42.886 --> 08:44.251
No, sorry...

08:44.422 --> 08:47.016
For me, ski...
No, sorry.

08:47.958 --> 08:48.947
So...

08:52.463 --> 08:54.556
It's boring, but easy.

08:54.732 --> 08:57.292
The calender has two parts.

08:57.468 --> 09:00.403
The bottom: the months
and here: the nude girls.

09:00.552 --> 09:02.783
Get it?

09:02.818 --> 09:05.235
- Slowly.
- A redhead with a big bush.

09:06.010 --> 09:09.912
We don't do this part.
We do the boring bit...

09:10.080 --> 09:14.813
...the name of the cretin
who sends out this crappy calender.

09:15.619 --> 09:16.745
So...

09:17.621 --> 09:20.886
...when you get a file, you open it.

09:22.159 --> 09:25.424
This text comes from the typesetting machine.

09:25.596 --> 09:26.722
Typesetting?

09:26.897 --> 09:29.957
This revolting machine
is the typesetter.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.294
This glue...

09:42.046 --> 09:45.072
My mother told me...
She said...

09:45.950 --> 09:47.645
...that my job is...

09:48.052 --> 09:49.952
Do you speak Spanish?

09:51.655 --> 09:54.852
<i>Non parlo tudo
españolito, du tout.</i>

10:08.172 --> 10:10.003
Fuck, An artist! He won't last.

10:14.987 --> 10:16.787
Yeah, no.

10:38.729 --> 10:41.052
- It's terrible.
- No, it's horrible.

10:59.129 --> 11:01.629
So, Courchevel or Máribel?

11:06.730 --> 11:07.924
- Beat it!
- Screw you!

12:25.272 --> 12:26.873
"Disasterology!"

12:34.431 --> 12:37.489
Look at yourself.
It ain't the pampas here!

12:42.559 --> 12:44.117
You shaved with a cracker?

12:44.294 --> 12:45.488
What's "shave cracker"?

16:21.612 --> 16:24.172
<i>You okay, honey?
How was yesterday?</i>

16:28.752 --> 16:29.741
<i>Did it go badly?</i>

16:29.820 --> 16:32.345
My job is shit! A piece of shit!

16:32.346 --> 16:35.663
Mom...I glue paper
in a basement all day!

16:35.993 --> 16:37.217
<i>Your paintings...</i>

16:37.394 --> 16:40.022
They don't need a graphic designer.

16:40.197 --> 16:42.256
<i>But Pouchet said...</i>

16:42.432 --> 16:45.162
No, not true. Not true!

16:45.335 --> 16:47.166
You lied to get me back here.

16:47.337 --> 16:49.328
I won't stay another day!

16:49.506 --> 16:52.532
<i>That's not nice.
Come see us on Wednesday.</i>

16:52.709 --> 16:53.835
<i>Hugs, darling.</i>

17:06.757 --> 17:09.055
See how cute you were.

17:44.962 --> 17:46.327
Oh shit!!

17:46.997 --> 17:48.259
What're you doing?

17:48.432 --> 17:49.797
I've gone through.

17:49.967 --> 17:52.765
The mezzanine goes on this wall.

17:52.936 --> 17:56.565
No, head pointing north.
It's feng shui.

17:56.740 --> 17:57.934
Isn't that north?

17:58.108 --> 18:00.941
And the door?
You come in, hit a beam...

18:01.111 --> 18:05.309
None of your sushi crap.
You're a danger with a drill.

19:13.250 --> 19:16.185
Wait! My back!
I'm carrying all the weight.

19:16.953 --> 19:18.420
Is your end heavier?

19:18.955 --> 19:22.356
Yeah, the deep notes
are always heavier.

19:22.526 --> 19:23.993
Go past, mister, if you like.

19:29.399 --> 19:31.026
My end's heavier.

19:32.235 --> 19:34.601
OK? You got it or not?

19:34.771 --> 19:36.170
Thanks, mister.

19:48.485 --> 19:49.747
Jeez!

19:50.787 --> 19:53.017
Who's that guy you brought?

19:55.058 --> 19:56.082
You OK?

19:56.660 --> 19:58.127
Are you hurt?

20:02.299 --> 20:04.358
Look at the mess you've made!

20:04.534 --> 20:07.503
You're not professionals!
I don't believe it!

20:07.771 --> 20:09.161
Does it hurt now?

20:09.340 --> 20:10.738
Yes.

20:11.007 --> 20:12.372
OK, and here?

20:12.542 --> 20:14.772
Yes, a little.

20:15.178 --> 20:18.670
No, I don't have...
much lucky in the current.

20:18.849 --> 20:19.838
What?

20:21.151 --> 20:22.641
That...I...

20:23.153 --> 20:25.883
No... my French is pathetic.

20:44.174 --> 20:46.267
Got some cream, Stéphanie?

20:46.443 --> 20:47.842
- Maybe over there.
- I'll get it.

20:53.517 --> 20:54.916
Thanks for the hole.

20:55.085 --> 20:57.315
My asshole landlady's next door.

20:57.487 --> 20:58.476
Screw her!

20:58.722 --> 20:59.916
What's that? No!

21:00.090 --> 21:02.650
- It's good.
- Very funny!

21:20.243 --> 21:21.267
There.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.787
That's enough!

21:57.681 --> 21:59.979
You're pretty cool for...

22:07.257 --> 22:08.656
It's better parked.

22:09.226 --> 22:10.784
- Is it OK?
- We'll see.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.695
Forget C major.
E's busted.

22:18.969 --> 22:21.199
I'll try C minor.
It's sadder.

22:24.975 --> 22:26.840
Mojor chords won't work.

22:27.677 --> 22:29.775
Congratulations, great!

22:30.480 --> 22:31.811
Quiet, he's hurt.

22:31.982 --> 22:32.779
Oh yeah.

22:38.955 --> 22:41.549
- Let's go.
- Use the brake next time.

22:41.791 --> 22:42.849
Bye.

22:54.437 --> 22:55.927
That's handy!

23:31.541 --> 23:32.803
Look, it's funny.

24:12.048 --> 24:13.879
Stop it! It's not funny.

24:14.117 --> 24:15.982
HE doesn't understand.

24:16.152 --> 24:18.848
Don't make fun of people
in my home.

24:23.226 --> 24:25.126
Thanks a lot for the hand.

24:26.229 --> 24:28.197
And sorry about the piano.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.683
With your stupid lies...

24:52.856 --> 24:54.983
...we look like two dumb bitches

24:55.158 --> 24:57.820
It'd be cool to be and art director.

24:57.994 --> 25:01.589
We'd get into gigs free
and get paid, too.

25:01.765 --> 25:04.529
Gigs are boring.
You put me to shame.

25:04.701 --> 25:06.032
What?

25:17.046 --> 25:19.173
Let's go to Momo's as usual.

25:19.349 --> 25:21.078
- How much do you weigh?
- 50 kilograms.

25:21.251 --> 25:22.240
Come here.

25:22.419 --> 25:24.853
Don't start again, Guy!

25:25.789 --> 25:27.154
Don't screw around!

25:30.059 --> 25:31.617
Come on, it's me!

25:31.795 --> 25:32.784
Who are the fags?

25:35.632 --> 25:37.395
Hold his hand, too!

25:37.567 --> 25:39.694
Just you watch!

25:39.869 --> 25:43.361
Next time I'll leave you
in the trash, weakling!

25:43.540 --> 25:46.532
- Momo's then?
- No, I'll eat alone.

28:24.901 --> 28:26.493
God, I'm so dumb.

28:52.629 --> 28:54.688
Prevention's better than cure.

28:54.864 --> 28:57.094
A bird in the hand...

28:57.333 --> 28:59.233
...is worth my bush

33:48.090 --> 33:49.421
Thanks.

35:29.291 --> 35:31.452
Dear Stéphanie...

35:31.627 --> 35:33.822
Iway ouldshay...

35:34.563 --> 35:38.158
Iway ouldshay...
dear neighbour...

35:38.634 --> 35:41.330
Yes, you read it good.

35:41.504 --> 35:43.802
I have lady next door...

35:43.973 --> 35:49.377
I'm too confusé in fact
with my hand accidented on the piano...

35:49.545 --> 35:53.641
...and lied you...
feel myself guilty.

35:53.816 --> 35:55.477
I want confess.

37:00.850 --> 37:04.149
"I'm too confusé in fact
with my hand accidented on the piano... "

37:06.435 --> 37:07.950
Holy fuck!

38:19.762 --> 38:22.526
2:37 p. m.
As of this afternoon...

38:22.698 --> 38:25.132
...late is the same as absent.

38:25.301 --> 38:28.600
We must tell Pouchet.
Right, Guy?

38:36.178 --> 38:38.942
Mistakes shouldn't go unpunished.

38:42.284 --> 38:44.411
Why do my armpits smell...

38:44.587 --> 38:46.748
...like sperm? It's strange.

38:46.922 --> 38:48.321
What do you think?

38:53.596 --> 38:56.360
Guy's making me smell the sperm!

38:58.968 --> 39:00.196
Excuse me.

39:02.372 --> 39:03.823
Guy...

39:04.358 --> 39:06.664
What makes you think
you can do that?

39:06.842 --> 39:10.107
No one else can work this shitty machine!

39:10.279 --> 39:12.247
And Stéphane?

39:16.452 --> 39:17.749
OK...

39:49.018 --> 39:50.952
<i>Stéphanie?</i>

39:53.656 --> 39:55.283
<i>Stéphanie?</i>

39:58.627 --> 40:00.959
<i>- Stéphanie.
- Stéphanie.</i>

40:21.250 --> 40:22.774
Damn!

40:34.296 --> 40:35.820
- Martine...
- Yes?

40:59.221 --> 41:02.019
Start again. You've lost me.

41:02.791 --> 41:04.554
Well, I was sleeping...

41:04.727 --> 41:06.957
...dreaming of a praying mantis...

41:08.497 --> 41:11.898
...fighting with a turtle,
but the turtle...

41:12.067 --> 41:16.970
...had a silver shell,
like a CD, but in a hump.

41:17.139 --> 41:19.664
And they fought over an elephant...

41:19.842 --> 41:22.037
Not that. Tell the next part.

41:22.211 --> 41:25.009
So I wake up, because...

41:26.815 --> 41:30.182
...I hear a freaky sound
at the front door.

41:31.420 --> 41:32.648
I turn on the light.

41:32.821 --> 41:34.789
This is my favourite bit.

41:34.957 --> 41:37.425
Stéphane, who twisted his hand...

41:37.593 --> 41:39.754
...is butt-naked in the hall.

41:40.496 --> 41:44.193
Stéphane, who helped me
move in, is my neighbour.

41:44.366 --> 41:46.027
My landlady's son.

41:46.735 --> 41:47.724
OK...

41:47.903 --> 41:49.097
But tell me...

41:49.271 --> 41:52.434
Remember the letter.
What did it say?

41:52.608 --> 41:56.009
<i>I told you, it was gobbledygook.
It went...</i>

41:56.178 --> 41:59.545
...I'm your neigbour, a liar,
blah, blah...

42:02.117 --> 42:03.948
What did he mean?

42:04.119 --> 42:05.780
What do you think?

42:06.422 --> 42:10.688
Neighbour, you're swell,
but your firend rings my bell.

42:11.126 --> 42:12.457
No way!

42:12.628 --> 42:16.189
Why doesn't he know
you know he's your neighbour?

42:16.832 --> 42:18.857
He doesn't know I read it.

42:19.034 --> 42:22.162
Straight after,
Captain Hook got it back.

42:21.837 --> 42:23.829
A change of heart.

42:24.088 --> 42:25.839
Holy fuck!

42:26.174 --> 42:28.243
But why did he lie
about his address?

42:28.410 --> 42:30.776
Why did you lie
about our jobs?

42:31.547 --> 42:36.177
Look, I'll give him your number -
you ask him.

42:36.351 --> 42:38.876
I've got a guy, remember?

42:39.054 --> 42:40.385
You tease others.

42:42.057 --> 42:44.548
How dare you say that!

42:44.726 --> 42:48.184
I'm no prick-tease!
You take that back!

42:48.363 --> 42:52.163
If you can't stop fighting,
don't be friends.

42:53.135 --> 42:55.626
Stéphanie, stock taking.

42:55.804 --> 42:58.796
We're exchanging ideas,
not fighting.

42:58.974 --> 43:00.669
Big difference.

43:00.943 --> 43:04.936
So, Miroux, Ornano...
Miroux, Caulaincourt...

43:05.113 --> 43:07.513
Miroux, Rue Labat. Bingo!

43:17.593 --> 43:19.026
It's ringing!

43:22.164 --> 43:23.461
Go on, take it!

43:23.632 --> 43:24.758
Take it!

43:24.933 --> 43:26.059
<i>Hello?</i>

43:44.653 --> 43:46.883
In French, it's more fun!

43:49.458 --> 43:52.484
I'm with Zoé
and we were wondering...

43:52.661 --> 43:55.858
<i>...if you had
any other optical illusions.</i>

43:56.031 --> 43:58.499
Opticklish illusions?

44:11.847 --> 44:13.337
Now, now!

44:23.992 --> 44:25.584
He's got nerve!

44:35.203 --> 44:37.103
It matches your green eyes.

44:37.272 --> 44:39.103
Bullshit!

44:39.675 --> 44:42.701
You can't wear
the same jeans forever!

44:42.878 --> 44:45.210
- I'll look ridiculous.
- No!

45:00.929 --> 45:02.487
He's going down.

45:02.664 --> 45:04.962
What a dumbass!

46:07.963 --> 46:08.987
Ace of spades.

46:18.573 --> 46:20.507
One, two, three!

46:27.716 --> 46:29.047
Hey, bottoms up!

46:36.558 --> 46:38.025
Who's this guy?

46:38.927 --> 46:39.951
Zoé?

46:40.128 --> 46:43.586
No, wrong address!
I live next door...

46:44.166 --> 46:45.929
I was told you were pretty,
and I had to see for myself.

46:46.101 --> 46:47.591
Oh, yeah?

46:57.813 --> 46:59.747
Not prick-teases, I hope.

46:59.915 --> 47:02.179
No, we have sex, too!

50:16.678 --> 50:19.169
- Do the tablecloth one!
- Not tonight.

50:19.347 --> 50:20.746
Go on.

50:20.916 --> 50:23.282
Oh, shit! I told you.

50:23.451 --> 50:25.544
It takes preparation.

50:28.757 --> 50:30.384
- Imagine!
- It's not funny.

50:33.828 --> 50:34.886
Thank you for dinner.

50:38.133 --> 50:40.727
Why didn't you go to work today?

50:40.902 --> 50:43.097
- I did.
- Pouchet phoned.

50:43.271 --> 50:44.795
I did, Mom!

50:44.973 --> 50:48.204
I worked all day...
in my dream.

50:48.743 --> 50:49.903
I'm very tired.

50:50.078 --> 50:55.573
Since he was 6,
he's inverted dream and reality.

50:55.750 --> 50:58.014
He'd be in bed,
vomit all over...

50:58.253 --> 51:00.881
...sure his hands
were like tower blocks.

51:01.056 --> 51:03.718
Houses, Mom. Not towers.

51:03.892 --> 51:07.521
Dreams are very tiring.
They have cycles.

51:07.729 --> 51:10.960
You've got slow-wave sleep,
deep-sleep, dream-sleep.

51:24.245 --> 51:26.145
He must be in love.

51:28.016 --> 51:30.416
Have you met someone?

51:40.729 --> 51:42.629
Love extrapolates your REM.

51:42.797 --> 51:43.821
Oh, OK...

51:48.937 --> 51:52.304
Your eyes follow
your dream movements.

51:52.474 --> 51:54.840
If you walk downstairs, say...

51:55.343 --> 51:58.540
...your eyes go down. Turn right - the eyes go right.

51:59.381 --> 52:00.848
<i>It's in your dream...</i>

52:01.016 --> 52:02.677
<i>...your eyes are walking.</i>

55:54.649 --> 55:55.877
What a pain.

58:29.470 --> 58:31.199
Something wrong?

58:31.372 --> 58:34.899
Will you manage all those files?

58:38.746 --> 58:42.045
"Aheart that sighs
has not what it desires".

58:42.216 --> 58:44.047
Must be love.

58:52.226 --> 58:54.751
Give him a break.
He doesn't want to talk.

59:00.802 --> 59:03.532
Maybe the feeling's not mutual.

59:03.704 --> 59:05.672
Maybe she's with somebody.

59:06.207 --> 59:07.697
Shit!

59:09.677 --> 59:11.577
You're so clumsy, you two!

59:11.746 --> 59:17.207
<i>Stéphane, tell the campanieros
they're heavios</i>

01:06:15.301 --> 01:06:16.632
A sloping lake!

01:06:18.705 --> 01:06:19.967
A sloping lake!

01:06:45.131 --> 01:06:49.465
You take her from behind
on the side of the bed.

01:06:49.635 --> 01:06:51.159
Oh, I'll try that.

01:06:51.337 --> 01:06:53.066
You pigs! Stop it!

01:15:15.808 --> 01:15:17.571
<i>Two months later</i>

01:15:18.143 --> 01:15:21.112
He's shy.
He only speaks French to me.

01:15:27.686 --> 01:15:29.551
Stéphanie.

01:15:29.722 --> 01:15:32.657
Let me kiss you.
You're a good person.

01:15:32.825 --> 01:15:36.591
You sure, Mme Miroux?
He said nothing bad about me?

01:15:36.762 --> 01:15:40.198
No, nothing.
I choose my tenants carefully.

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:43.692
So, what do you think?

01:15:43.869 --> 01:15:45.097
I adore it!

01:15:45.271 --> 01:15:48.399
Really? I've always found it rather strange.

01:15:48.574 --> 01:15:51.543
That's what's good.

01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:53.974
- I like the colours.
- Unusual.

01:15:58.384 --> 01:16:00.011
Not very cheerful!

01:16:00.185 --> 01:16:03.882
Six months ago,
a stranger came to see me...

01:16:04.923 --> 01:16:08.222
...with a terrible accent
and a dumb project.

01:16:08.394 --> 01:16:12.160
The world and myself
weren't ready for it.

01:16:12.331 --> 01:16:14.822
We've leapt forward
into absurdity.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.628
And I regret to say
our new calendar...

01:16:18.337 --> 01:16:22.603
..."Disasterology"
by Mr Stéphane Miroux...

01:16:22.775 --> 01:16:24.504
...is a huge success!

01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:33.341
In French.

01:16:33.519 --> 01:16:35.350
No, in English, Mama.

01:19:25.691 --> 01:19:27.215
Oh damn!

01:20:53.078 --> 01:20:54.773
That needs an explanation.

01:20:54.947 --> 01:20:57.313
Look who's woken up.

01:20:57.482 --> 01:21:00.474
Have a drink.
Your mom's feeling down.

01:21:00.652 --> 01:21:03.246
She needs comforting.
She's moving back in.

01:21:03.422 --> 01:21:06.289
This calls for a drink. Come on.

01:21:08.226 --> 01:21:10.717
Not exactly a triumph.

01:22:53.432 --> 01:22:58.301
<i>It's outrageous to attack
the hospital staff. Appalling!</i>

01:22:58.470 --> 01:23:02.065
<i>Well it's a big letdown
for our charming nurses...</i>

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:07.109
<i>...who go beyond the call of duty
with a wet T-shirt contest...</i>

01:23:07.279 --> 01:23:10.407
Asshole! Dumb asshole!

01:23:14.152 --> 01:23:16.882
- Let's take our minds off it.
- The TV?

01:23:37.743 --> 01:23:39.574
You wanna fight?

01:23:51.723 --> 01:23:54.692
Over there!
It'll make a better splash.

01:23:56.027 --> 01:24:00.430
One, two, three!

01:24:00.732 --> 01:24:02.461
Are you crazy?

01:24:02.634 --> 01:24:05.467
This isn't a garbage dump!

01:24:05.637 --> 01:24:07.332
TV's garbage anyways!

01:24:07.506 --> 01:24:10.475
Yes it is, but that's still no reason...

01:24:11.243 --> 01:24:12.301
It floats!

01:24:13.645 --> 01:24:16.205
Maybe the fish enjoy that crap!

01:24:16.381 --> 01:24:18.406
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:26:41.726 --> 01:26:45.321
The office is a hellhole!
You can't leave me here.

01:26:45.497 --> 01:26:46.964
The stupid bitch!

01:26:47.132 --> 01:26:48.793
Not stupid bitch!

01:27:40.585 --> 01:27:41.574
What was that?

01:27:43.822 --> 01:27:45.084
No, wait.

01:27:52.163 --> 01:27:54.927
I'll cover for you.

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:59.196
But if you don't screw her or at least kiss her...

01:27:59.371 --> 01:28:02.397
...with tongues, a real French kiss...

01:28:04.576 --> 01:28:08.012
I'll never speak to you again!

01:28:08.179 --> 01:28:09.976
Bye!

01:28:10.715 --> 01:28:12.012
Bye...

01:28:17.555 --> 01:28:21.491
If he carries on,
he'll leave before he arrives.

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:24.394
Maybe he works bakwards.

01:28:24.562 --> 01:28:26.154
He brags with his calendar.

01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:28.458
I sent him on an errand!

01:28:28.633 --> 01:28:30.533
You fuckin' dykes!

01:28:31.403 --> 01:28:33.462
Now that's enough.

01:28:33.638 --> 01:28:38.041
Being called fags is one thing,
but dykes is unacceptable.

01:32:10.288 --> 01:32:11.949
Still hurting?

01:32:16.227 --> 01:32:18.127
Careful...

01:32:22.066 --> 01:32:24.125
It's much better.

01:32:27.438 --> 01:32:30.532
I'll tell the office you're sick.

01:32:30.775 --> 01:32:33.243
We'll have a nice, quiet day, OK?

01:32:33.578 --> 01:32:34.670
Mom?

01:32:36.314 --> 01:32:39.750
I'm sorry I went with dad when he left.

01:32:39.917 --> 01:32:41.441
That's OK.

01:32:51.162 --> 01:32:52.390
Thanks.

01:32:52.563 --> 01:32:55.396
- I'll come to the airport.
- No need.

01:32:55.566 --> 01:32:56.999
I can't just leave you.

01:32:57.168 --> 01:33:00.433
It's OK, really.
I'll call you from Mexico.

01:33:00.772 --> 01:33:03.172
Go speak to her.
Do it for me.

01:33:03.073 --> 01:33:04.173
No.

01:33:05.176 --> 01:33:07.337
I don't want to, now.

01:33:10.448 --> 01:33:12.245
Don't be ridiculous.

01:33:12.417 --> 01:33:15.113
You can't go without saying goodbye.

01:33:16.321 --> 01:33:18.812
I feel stupid now.

01:33:20.958 --> 01:33:24.416
You don't know what happened.
You go on and on.

01:33:24.595 --> 01:33:27.325
Stéphane this, Stéphane that.

01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:29.928
Shut the door.

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:47.168
I like your tit.
It erects me in my pants...
