01:49.776 --> 01:53.655
It's been near six years
since I last saw my lord husband, Maester.

01:54.697 --> 01:57.659
I must know... will he live?

01:58.576 --> 02:01.079
He led his sailors into an ambush.

02:01.079 --> 02:05.041
A ship made to look
as if it were abandoned.

02:05.041 --> 02:09.754
In the fighting, his neck was slashed
by a corsair's dagger.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.215
He fell overboard into the sea.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.259
The wound was severe.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.969
Much blood was lost.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.055
But the greater concern
is the fever that followed.

02:19.055 --> 02:23.059
The ship's maester said
he burns from within.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.198
The ravens came in from?

02:37.282 --> 02:39.409
Evenfall, Princess.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.954
So they arrive in three days.

02:45.331 --> 02:48.001
Let all be made ready to receive him,
Maester Kelvyn.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.634
The Sea Snake is strong.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.344
No doubt.

02:58.428 --> 03:02.473
And yet, I have seen blood fever
overcome men half his age.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.685
I will not suffer the talk
of crows in my house, Vaemond.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.354
I love my brother...

03:08.438 --> 03:11.107
but we must be honest with ourselves.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.276
We may greet his ship to find him gone.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.820
And who will take the Driftwood Throne?

03:15.904 --> 03:17.655
My grandmother seems
quite comfortable here.

03:17.739 --> 03:21.284
She presides only in the absence
of her husband.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.537
On his death, the seat passes.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.705
To Lucerys Velaryon.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.415
As is my lord husband's desire.

03:27.415 --> 03:30.960
I am the Sea Snake's own blood,

03:31.044 --> 03:33.546
the closest kin he has left.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.840
Be careful, good-brother.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.675
One could take your words for treason.

03:46.517 --> 03:49.437
I speak the truth, Rhaenys.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.023
And you know it.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.984
The matter has been decided.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.986
By a man whose ambition

03:57.070 --> 04:00.657
has brought down on us
calamity after calamity.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.868
My brother cares only
for the history books.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.331
But what of the Velaryon line?

04:08.331 --> 04:10.959
Is it to be snuffed out,

04:10.959 --> 04:14.170
supplanted by the pups of House Strong?

04:14.170 --> 04:17.840
Driftmark is mine by all rights.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.801
And while I should like your support,

04:19.801 --> 04:22.804
I do not... need it.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.058
The winds have shifted.

04:27.976 --> 04:32.355
The crown has good reason to take my side.

04:32.355 --> 04:35.191
My cousin the King
would have your tongue for this.

04:35.191 --> 04:40.196
But it's not a king who sits
the Iron Throne these days, good-sister.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.699
It's a queen.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.882
The Conqueror and his sisters
sailed with a great army.

07:11.013 --> 07:14.308
And landed at the Blackwater Rush.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.441
At the end?

07:22.525 --> 07:26.070
- The mouth.
- Mouth! Come on, Jace, you knew that.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.746
Come on, Jace.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.373
Perhaps that's enough for this morning.

07:37.373 --> 07:39.458
No, no. I want to keep going.

07:40.877 --> 07:41.961
Maester.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.759
Aegon... ordered
that the trees should be...

07:49.844 --> 07:51.762
- ...killed.
- Felled.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.639
It is a related word.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.225
I don't expect you to learn
High Valyrian in a day, Jace.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.645
A king should honor the traditions
of his forbears.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.148
Well... unless you're planning

08:02.148 --> 08:05.193
to depose your own mother,
you have plenty of time to study.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.744
Leave us.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.581
Joffrey... come.

08:39.393 --> 08:42.730
He means to call into question
Luke's legitimacy.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.399
And by extension Jace,

08:45.483 --> 08:47.610
and by extension
my own claim to the throne.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.739
Vaemond cares only about Driftmark
and the Velaryon line.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.200
Not about our politics.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.410
Has he made common cause
with Otto Hightower yet?

08:56.494 --> 08:58.287
This is what I fear.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.414
Rhaenys has flown to court.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.166
Surely, she cannot
be planning to back him.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.126
No. Whatever disagreements
we may have had,

09:04.210 --> 09:05.753
she's not cruel...

09:06.379 --> 09:09.090
- or stupid enough to do that.
- Disagreements?

09:09.090 --> 09:12.218
She believes we had her son killed
so that we might marry.

09:12.218 --> 09:16.097
Yes... and yet, she's taken Baela to ward.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.891
Yes. It is Laena's memory she honors.
She has no love for us.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.937
Has the vipers' venom spread so far?

09:22.937 --> 09:26.190
Those vipers rule in my father's name.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.817
And my father--

09:34.782 --> 09:36.742
What choice do I have?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.834
To King's Landing, then.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.711
All hail Rhaenyra of House Targaryen,

10:28.711 --> 10:31.422
Princess of Dragonstone
and heir to the Iron Throne

10:31.422 --> 10:34.967
and her royal consort,
Prince Daemon Targaryen.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.961
Welcome back, Princess.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.047
Lord Caswell.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.726
I would say it's nice to be home,
but I scarcely recognize it.

11:31.524 --> 11:36.779
We have continued to enjoy
improved customs duties

11:36.779 --> 11:39.156
since the settling of the Stepstones.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.243
And the extent to which we exploit those

11:42.243 --> 11:46.539
is contingent on
the harbor master's receipts.

11:46.539 --> 11:51.794
Of which septons have requested

11:51.794 --> 11:54.171
half that again for a bronze bust

11:54.255 --> 11:57.925
they wish to commission
for the Festival of the Mother,

11:57.925 --> 11:59.427
which I would not recommend.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.388
Thank you for that exhaustive
accounting, Lord Beesbury.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.556
I remind you--

12:11.188 --> 12:13.315
Your guests have arrived, Your Grace.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.193
I trust they've been welcomed
as befits their station.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.195
As you instructed, Lord Hand.

12:19.738 --> 12:23.701
It was my understanding Lord Corlys
wished for his grandson Lucerys

12:23.701 --> 12:25.536
to succeed him as Lord of the Tides.

12:25.536 --> 12:29.623
The boy has been raised most of his life
away from Driftmark.

12:29.707 --> 12:33.002
He can fly a dragon, yes,
but can he command a fleet?

12:33.002 --> 12:35.463
Ability does not alter his claim.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.507
The Sea Snake has never
formally named him as heir,

12:38.591 --> 12:39.967
if it comes to that.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.511
The crown must choose
what is best for the realm.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.347
He is Laenor's son.
What grounds could there be--

12:45.431 --> 12:47.475
What indeed, Lord Beesbury.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.101
What indeed.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.770
We shall hear
Princess Rhaenyra's petition,

12:51.854 --> 12:53.898
along with those of the other claimants
on the morrow.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.942
I do beg your pardon, my lords.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.360
I must greet our guests.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.660
Shall we levy a tax
on the sale of new wool?

13:06.744 --> 13:08.537
Your Grace...

13:08.621 --> 13:10.664
a matter has arisen that
requires your attention.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.875
Whatever it is, Ser Arryk,
it'll need to wait.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.670
- I'm Erryk, Your Grace.
- Of course. My apologies, ser.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.380
It's about the Prince.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.383
There's been a delicate situation
in his apartments.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.917
Father?

14:19.650 --> 14:22.403
- Who goes there?
- Father.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.282
It's me, my King.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.742
Rhaenyra.

14:30.619 --> 14:31.870
Oh...

14:36.750 --> 14:38.669
I'm here with Daemon.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.879
Daemon?

14:41.505 --> 14:42.631
Daemon?

14:45.134 --> 14:46.510
Daemon.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.223
Help me up.

14:57.605 --> 14:58.772
Oh...

15:08.532 --> 15:10.659
It has been so long.

15:16.206 --> 15:20.127
The Sea Snake has taken
a grave wound in battle in the Stepstones.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.339
When?

15:23.339 --> 15:25.924
We won that war years ago.

15:26.008 --> 15:26.925
No.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.220
The Triarchy is resurgent.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.474
The fighting is anew.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.103
There is a petition to decide
upon the succession of Driftmark

15:38.187 --> 15:40.230
and the heir to the Driftwood Throne.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.069
Petitions?

15:46.862 --> 15:51.075
Alicent and Otto...
they see to all that business now.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.160
No, brother, listen to me.

15:54.078 --> 15:57.414
You are to affirm
your position for Lucerys

15:57.498 --> 16:00.000
to be Corlys Velaryon's successor.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.922
Has something happened to Lord Corlys?

16:06.799 --> 16:07.925
Father...

16:08.676 --> 16:11.595
there's someone we wish
to introduce you to.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.781
Daemon.

16:32.783 --> 16:33.951
Brother.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.330
Who is that?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.583
Father...

16:42.876 --> 16:45.421
this is Aegon.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.424
Aegon.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.427
And this... is Viserys.

16:53.429 --> 16:56.765
Ah... Viserys.

17:00.227 --> 17:04.606
Now that is a name fit for a king.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.112
Oh...

17:12.489 --> 17:15.451
Oh, oh...

17:15.451 --> 17:16.618
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.706
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.374
I'm so--

17:25.836 --> 17:28.630
I'm sorry. I'm sor--

17:28.714 --> 17:29.798
Please.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.887
- My tea. My tea.
- What tea? This?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.389
Yes. Yes.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.058
Yes.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.298
I brought her here immediately.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.300
She's seen no one else, Your Grace.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.265
Come here, sweetling.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.109
Tell me your name.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.406
It's Dyana, Your Grace.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.160
If it please you.

18:41.912 --> 18:45.040
Dyana. What a pretty name.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.128
I understand you've found
yourself in some trouble.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.592
I was fetching the Prince his wine,

18:55.676 --> 18:59.596
and I put it on his table,
and when I turned--

19:00.597 --> 19:02.140
I didn't see him.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.352
I asked him to stop, Your Grace.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.188
I did, truly...

19:08.272 --> 19:10.148
you must believe me.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.164
Thank you for telling me, Dyana.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.547
I know it wasn't your fault.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.634
I believe you.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.261
You do?

19:40.512 --> 19:41.638
I do.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.727
But what I worry about...

19:47.978 --> 19:49.897
is what others might believe.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.359
You were alone with the Prince,
were you not?

19:54.443 --> 19:56.695
Yes, I--

19:56.695 --> 19:59.531
And no one else saw what happened
between the two of you.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.618
If anyone else were to hear about this--

20:02.618 --> 20:06.830
- I haven't told anyone.
- You told Ser Erryk and Talya and now me.

20:07.789 --> 20:11.084
And though I believe you are not to blame,
others might not be so trusting.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.589
They might think you were trying
to besmirch the Prince, or worse...

20:16.590 --> 20:19.509
that you're the sort of girl that
might have enticed him in the first place.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.430
And you know what happens
to girls like that.

20:25.474 --> 20:30.020
I wouldn't dream of breathing another word
to anyone, Your Grace.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.440
I swear it on my life.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.366
I know you won't.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.755
For your troubles.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.264
The tea, Your Grace.

21:20.779 --> 21:21.947
It's best to be certain.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.309
<i>Get up.</i>

21:51.393 --> 21:52.936
Aegon!

21:55.772 --> 21:56.898
Get up!

22:00.527 --> 22:01.528
Mother?

22:03.155 --> 22:06.742
- What is it?
-"What is it? What is it?

22:06.742 --> 22:08.535
What is it?"
That's all you can say for yourself?

22:08.535 --> 22:09.953
Has something happened?

22:11.079 --> 22:12.247
Dyana.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.250
The serving girl.

22:16.126 --> 22:19.087
Oh, for the gods' sake.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.590
The girl, Aegon. The one
you sent fleeing from your company.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.301
It was just harmless fun.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.804
She didn't need to go
and get upset about it.

22:27.888 --> 22:31.224
Think of the shame on your wife, on me.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.519
How can you keep carrying on like this,

22:34.603 --> 22:36.480
especially on a day like today?

22:36.480 --> 22:38.065
Why? What is it today?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.790
You are no son of mine.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.090
I did not ask for this.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.175
I've done everything you've asked me to,

23:05.175 --> 23:07.344
and I try so...

23:07.344 --> 23:10.597
I try so hard, but it will never be enough
for you or father.

23:13.141 --> 23:17.020
Have you seen Dyana?
She's supposed to dress the children.

23:24.444 --> 23:27.405
He looks like a different person.

23:27.489 --> 23:31.076
I believe we should also
consult Maester Gerardys.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.995
Perhaps if he could see the King,
he'd suggest a different--

23:34.079 --> 23:36.123
Princess Rhaenyra.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.749
And Prince Daemon.

23:40.252 --> 23:43.588
It has been so long since we were granted
the joy of your presence.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.051
Indeed, Your Grace.

23:48.135 --> 23:51.054
Though not long enough to merit a greeting
upon our arrival.

23:51.638 --> 23:54.349
I'm sure the Queen had pressing business,
my love.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.811
What can either of us
know of ruling a kingdom?

23:57.811 --> 24:00.605
I do not rule, as you well know.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.316
My father and I are mere
stewards of the King's will and wisdom.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.610
And how exactly is that wisdom expressed?

24:07.904 --> 24:09.990
In blinks and wheezes?

24:09.990 --> 24:11.741
I'd be surprised if he could remember
his own name.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.660
- Or if you could.
- King Viserys's condition

24:13.660 --> 24:15.328
has worsened since you saw him last.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.999
It subjects him to considerable pain.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.585
- On the advice of the maesters--
- Ah, the maesters.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.671
Of course. It is they who keep him...

24:25.255 --> 24:28.925
addled on milk of the poppy
while the Hightowers warm his throne.

24:29.009 --> 24:32.721
Rhaenyra, if you would see him without it,
almost blind with suffering.

24:32.721 --> 24:36.641
Alicent, I have no doubt
it was an act of the purest mercy,

24:36.725 --> 24:39.186
but tell me, for the King's suffering,

24:39.186 --> 24:42.272
did the maesters also prescribe
the removal of Targaryen heraldry

24:42.272 --> 24:44.941
and the installation
in its stead of various statues and stars?

24:46.193 --> 24:49.487
The emblems of the Seven serve only
to guide us on an uncertain path.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.365
- To remind us of a higher authority.
- And on the morrow,

24:52.449 --> 24:56.119
which authority will sit in judgment
of my son's claim on his own inheritance?

24:57.037 --> 24:59.748
That would be mine... and the Hand's.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.791
But be assured,
the Father is just and commands me

25:01.875 --> 25:05.003
to forget the accusations
you have hurled in this room today.

25:11.218 --> 25:14.804
- Smaller than I remember.
- It looks exactly the same.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.348
Luke, come on.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.449
See? I told you this would still be here.

25:34.449 --> 25:37.118
And you thought you could swing
Criston's morningstar.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.788
And you almost took your own head off.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.046
- What's your problem?
- Everyone's staring at us.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.302
No one would question me
being heir to Driftmark...

25:55.136 --> 25:56.263
if...

25:57.180 --> 26:00.892
if I looked more like Ser Laenor Velaryon
than Ser Harwin Strong.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.854
It doesn't matter what they think.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.151
Well done, my Prince.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.652
You'll be winning tourneys in no time.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.863
I don't give a shit about tourneys.

26:55.655 --> 26:56.781
Nephews...

26:58.325 --> 26:59.492
have you come to train?

27:00.577 --> 27:01.911
Open the gate!

27:35.987 --> 27:37.781
Hold your nerve, my Queen.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.283
What we do,
we do for the good of the realm.

27:40.367 --> 27:44.204
I must confess a certain uneasiness
now this is at hand.

27:45.205 --> 27:49.334
- He may yet live.
- But we must be prepared if he does not.

27:57.801 --> 28:00.595
The realm has enjoyed a long peace,

28:00.595 --> 28:03.640
a credit to the work of both
Jaehaerys and Viserys,

28:03.640 --> 28:07.352
but the threat of war looms
and may arrive on our shores.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.522
When it does,
will you want a child at the command

28:10.522 --> 28:12.732
of the greatest fleet in Westeros?

28:14.567 --> 28:16.486
We must, of course...

28:17.612 --> 28:19.739
act in the interest of our subjects.

28:21.783 --> 28:25.328
The next Lord of the Tides
will be deeply in your debt, Your Grace.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.664
As will Driftmark...

28:27.664 --> 28:29.833
in all its strength.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.726
Grandmother?

28:52.480 --> 28:53.481
Rhaena.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.575
Baela said you might be here.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.120
She's done well as your ward.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.329
You've...

29:09.789 --> 29:11.166
raised her admirably.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.668
You honor me, Princess.

29:14.794 --> 29:17.338
Might I speak to the Princess alone,
Rhaena?

29:20.717 --> 29:21.843
Princess.

29:31.686 --> 29:37.233
I wondered for many an hour
what your purpose was in coming here.

29:37.317 --> 29:40.361
Whether you'd speak for or against
the suit brought by Ser Vaemond.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.363
But then, I realized...

29:43.239 --> 29:45.158
you intend to advocate for yourself.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.206
This is no fair proceeding.

29:51.206 --> 29:55.251
It is a trap
set by the Queen and the Hand, I'd wager,

29:55.335 --> 29:57.170
to proclaim my son illegitimate.

29:57.170 --> 30:00.173
Yet you did worse than that with Laenor.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.468
Did you not?

30:09.891 --> 30:11.476
I loved your son.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.856
You may not believe it
to be true, but I did.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.571
I did not order his death.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.159
Nor was I complicit in it.
I swear this to you.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.043
I'll make you an offer.

30:40.630 --> 30:41.839
Back Luke's claim,

30:41.923 --> 30:44.467
and let us betroth
Laena's children to mine.

30:46.511 --> 30:51.099
Baela will be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms

30:51.099 --> 30:53.893
and her sons will be heirs to the throne.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.938
Rhaena will rule in Driftmark, and

30:56.938 --> 30:59.566
the seat will pass to her and Lucerys's
children in time.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.776
A generous offer.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.906
- Or a desperate one.
- What does it matter?

31:11.494 --> 31:13.413
You are right in this, at least.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.127
It does not matter.

31:29.637 --> 31:31.973
You can bargain with me all you like.

31:32.890 --> 31:35.435
Bring my granddaughter
with you to soften my resolve.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.690
But tomorrow,
the Hightowers land their first blow.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.527
They force you to your knees...

31:45.320 --> 31:47.238
and I must stand alone.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.075
Alicent?

32:33.451 --> 32:34.952
Alicent...

32:35.036 --> 32:37.038
No, it's Rhaenyra, father.

32:41.376 --> 32:42.710
Rhaenyra.

32:48.925 --> 32:52.261
"The Song of Ice and Fire."
Do you believe it to be true?

32:55.014 --> 32:56.933
Aegon's Dream.

33:00.853 --> 33:02.480
You told me

33:02.480 --> 33:06.484
it was our duty to hold
the realm united against a common foe.

33:10.613 --> 33:13.533
By naming me heir, you divided the realm.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.712
I thought I wanted it.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.974
But the burden is a heavy one.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.478
It's too heavy.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.237
My...

33:52.864 --> 33:54.866
My only child.

33:59.287 --> 34:02.206
If you wish me to bear it, then defend me.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.251
And my children.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.173
It's...

35:06.854 --> 35:08.981
I want to have supper, Otto.

35:11.651 --> 35:15.196
- It is the morning, Your Grace.
- Tonight.

35:18.157 --> 35:20.868
The whole of my family

35:20.952 --> 35:22.870
are gathered at the Red Keep.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.793
I want us... to dine together.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.784
Bring milk of the poppy.

36:16.173 --> 36:17.341
No.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.430
Just arrange the supper.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.604
Though it is the great hope of this court

36:29.604 --> 36:34.066
that Lord Corlys Velaryon
survive his wounds,

36:34.150 --> 36:36.527
we gather here with the grim task

36:36.611 --> 36:39.155
of dealing with
the succession of Driftmark.

36:40.406 --> 36:43.576
As Hand, I speak with
the King's voice on this

36:43.576 --> 36:45.202
and all other matters.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.498
The crown will now hear the petitions.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.585
Ser Vaemond of House Velaryon.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.053
My Queen.

37:03.512 --> 37:04.639
My Lord Hand.

37:05.932 --> 37:09.018
The history of our noble houses
extends beyond the Seven Kingdoms

37:09.018 --> 37:11.312
to the days of Old Valyria.

37:11.312 --> 37:14.190
For as long as House Targaryen
has ruled the skies,

37:14.190 --> 37:16.901
House Velaryon has ruled the seas.

37:16.901 --> 37:21.489
When the Doom fell on Valyria,
our houses became the last of their kind.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.909
Our forebearers came to this new land,
knowing that were they to fail,

37:24.909 --> 37:28.120
it would mean the end to their bloodlines
and their name.

37:29.705 --> 37:33.459
I have spent my entire life
on Driftmark defending my brother's seat.

37:33.459 --> 37:37.254
I am Lord Corlys's closest kin,
his own blood.

37:37.338 --> 37:41.467
The true, unimpeachable blood
of House Velaryon runs through my veins.

37:41.467 --> 37:45.554
As it does in my sons,
the offspring of Laenor Velaryon.

37:45.638 --> 37:48.432
If you cared so much
about your house's blood, Ser Vaemond,

37:48.516 --> 37:50.643
you would not be so bold as
to supplant its rightful heir.

37:50.643 --> 37:54.105
No, you only speak for yourself
and for your own ambition.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.691
You will have chance to make
your own petition, Princess Rhaenyra.

37:56.691 --> 37:59.360
Do Ser Vaemond the courtesy
of allowing his to be heard.

38:05.324 --> 38:07.868
What do you know of Velaryon blood,
Princess?

38:09.328 --> 38:12.331
I could cut my veins and show it to you

38:12.415 --> 38:15.626
and you still wouldn't recognize it.

38:15.710 --> 38:19.630
This is about the future
and survival of my house, not yours.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.887
My Queen, my Lord Hand.

38:28.222 --> 38:31.142
This is a matter of blood, not ambition.

38:32.476 --> 38:37.273
I place the continuation of the survival
of my house and my line above all.

38:37.273 --> 38:40.484
I humbly put myself before you
as my brother's successor...

38:41.694 --> 38:45.239
the Lord of Driftmark
and Lord of the Tides.

38:46.323 --> 38:47.867
Thank you, Ser Vaemond.

38:54.999 --> 39:00.421
Princess Rhaenyra, you may now speak
for your son, Lucerys Velaryon.

39:05.843 --> 39:08.512
If I am to grace this farce
with some answer,

39:08.596 --> 39:12.141
I will start by reminding the court
that nearly 20 years ago, in this very--

39:17.480 --> 39:20.441
King Viserys of House Targaryen,

39:20.441 --> 39:22.526
the First of His Name,

39:22.610 --> 39:25.780
King of the Andals, and the Rhoynar,

39:25.780 --> 39:27.990
and the First Men,

39:28.074 --> 39:32.620
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.451
I will sit the throne today.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.663
Your Grace.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.756
I will be fine. I will be fine.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.439
I said I'm fine.

41:26.775 --> 41:27.943
- Ah...
- Come on.

41:35.284 --> 41:36.368
Steady.

42:18.077 --> 42:23.624
I must... admit... my confusion.

42:25.251 --> 42:27.503
I do not understand

42:27.503 --> 42:31.924
why petitions are being heard
over a settled succession.

42:31.924 --> 42:33.467
The only one present...

42:34.385 --> 42:38.973
who might offer keener insight
into Lord Corlys's wishes

42:38.973 --> 42:40.808
is the Princess Rhaenys.

42:44.603 --> 42:46.146
Indeed, Your Grace.

43:00.077 --> 43:03.205
It was ever my husband's
will that Driftmark

43:03.289 --> 43:05.958
pass through Ser Laenor

43:05.958 --> 43:07.960
to his trueborn son...

43:08.794 --> 43:10.879
Lucerys Velaryon.

43:10.963 --> 43:12.881
His mind never changed.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.884
Nor did my support of him.

43:17.011 --> 43:20.180
As a matter of fact, the Princess Rhaenyra
has just informed me of her desire

43:20.264 --> 43:22.391
to marry her sons Jace and Luke

43:22.391 --> 43:25.394
to Lord Corlys's granddaughters,
Baela and Rhaena.

43:26.270 --> 43:30.190
A proposal to which I heartily agree.

43:31.358 --> 43:34.903
Well... the matter is settled.

43:36.238 --> 43:37.573
Again.

43:38.741 --> 43:44.038
I hereby reaffirm
Prince Lucerys of House Velaryon

43:44.038 --> 43:46.290
as heir to Driftmark,

43:46.290 --> 43:51.253
the Driftwood Throne,
and the next Lord of the Tides.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.303
You break law...

44:00.554 --> 44:03.182
and centuries of tradition

44:03.182 --> 44:05.392
to install your daughter as heir.

44:06.602 --> 44:08.228
Yet you dare tell me...

44:09.271 --> 44:12.191
who deserves to inherit the name Velaryon.

44:14.526 --> 44:15.444
No.

44:16.945 --> 44:19.198
I will not allow it.

44:20.074 --> 44:21.617
"Allow it"?

44:22.659 --> 44:24.828
Do not forget yourself, Vaemond.

44:28.707 --> 44:33.379
That is no true Velaryon,

44:33.379 --> 44:36.882
and certainly no nephew of mine.

44:36.882 --> 44:39.009
Go to your chambers.
You have said enough.

44:40.260 --> 44:43.806
Lucerys is my true-born grandson.

44:44.723 --> 44:46.308
And you...

44:46.392 --> 44:49.812
are no more
than the second son of Driftmark.

44:50.896 --> 44:55.818
You... may run your house
as you see fit...

44:56.568 --> 44:59.696
but you will not decide
the future of mine.

45:01.573 --> 45:03.826
My house survived the Doom

45:03.826 --> 45:06.620
and a thousand tribulations besides.

45:06.620 --> 45:08.622
And gods be damned...

45:09.915 --> 45:15.587
I will not see it ended
on the account of this--

45:17.172 --> 45:18.715
Say it.

45:29.309 --> 45:30.853
Her children...

45:31.562 --> 45:33.772
are bastards!

45:37.067 --> 45:38.360
And she...

45:39.361 --> 45:40.279
is...

45:41.196 --> 45:42.489
a whore.

45:49.163 --> 45:50.080
I...

45:51.874 --> 45:53.459
will have your tongue for that.

46:01.049 --> 46:03.302
He can keep his tongue.

46:03.302 --> 46:05.929
- Disarm him!
- No need.

46:13.562 --> 46:15.731
- Call the maesters!
- Father?

46:15.731 --> 46:18.734
Please, my love. You must
take something for the pain.

46:19.610 --> 46:22.196
I will not cloud my mind.

46:22.196 --> 46:24.615
I must put things right.

47:09.868 --> 47:14.414
The body will be ready for its return
to Driftmark on the morrow, my lady.

47:17.167 --> 47:21.171
You may wish to leave the Silent Sisters
to their work.

47:21.255 --> 47:23.799
It is ill luck to look
upon the face of death.

47:28.136 --> 47:32.683
The Stranger has visited me more times
than I can count, Grand Maester.

47:36.979 --> 47:38.522
I assure you...

47:39.648 --> 47:43.569
he cares little whether my eyes
are open or closed.

49:08.945 --> 49:12.282
How good it is...
to see you all tonight...

49:13.492 --> 49:14.618
together.

49:20.749 --> 49:23.335
- Prayer before we begin?
- Yes.

49:24.711 --> 49:27.130
May the Mother smile down
on this gathering with love.

49:28.090 --> 49:31.718
May the Smith mend the bonds
that have been broken for far too long.

49:31.802 --> 49:35.722
And to Vaemond Velaryon,
may the gods give him rest.

49:43.146 --> 49:46.942
This is an occasion for celebration,
it seems.

49:46.942 --> 49:49.444
My grandsons, Jace and Luke,

49:49.528 --> 49:52.781
will marry their cousins,
Baela and Rhaena,

49:52.781 --> 49:56.159
further strengthening the bond
between our houses.

49:56.243 --> 49:59.705
A toast to the young Princes...

49:59.705 --> 50:02.457
- and their betrothed.
- Hear, hear!

50:03.291 --> 50:05.836
Well done, Jace.
You'll finally get to lie with a woman.

50:06.920 --> 50:10.465
Let us toast as well Prince Lucerys...

50:11.299 --> 50:14.094
the future Lord of the Tides.

50:14.094 --> 50:15.470
Hear, hear.

50:15.554 --> 50:17.097
You'll be great.

50:20.684 --> 50:25.063
You do know how the act is done, I assume?

50:25.147 --> 50:26.314
At least in principle?

50:26.398 --> 50:27.858
Where to put your cock and all that.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.276
Let it be, cousin.

50:29.276 --> 50:33.238
You can play the jester if you wish,
but hold your tongue before my betrothed.

50:54.718 --> 50:59.139
It both gladdens my heart

50:59.139 --> 51:03.393
and fills me with sorrow

51:03.477 --> 51:06.605
to see these faces around the table.

51:08.023 --> 51:11.568
The faces most dear
to me in all the world...

51:13.153 --> 51:15.363
yet grown so distant from each other...

51:16.490 --> 51:18.408
in the years past.

51:42.349 --> 51:44.893
My own face...

51:44.893 --> 51:47.229
is no longer a handsome one...

51:49.981 --> 51:51.900
if indeed it ever was.

51:55.111 --> 51:56.446
But tonight...

51:57.280 --> 52:00.617
I wish you to see me... as I am.

52:02.077 --> 52:03.620
Not just a king...

52:05.330 --> 52:06.915
but your father.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.501
Your brother.

52:10.210 --> 52:11.753
Your husband...

52:14.172 --> 52:15.715
and your grandsire.

52:16.883 --> 52:19.052
Who may not, it seems...

52:20.053 --> 52:21.972
walk for much longer among you.

52:27.686 --> 52:32.274
Let us no longer hold
ill feelings in our hearts.

52:33.483 --> 52:35.193
The crown cannot stand strong

52:35.277 --> 52:37.821
if the House of the Dragon
remains divided.

52:38.864 --> 52:41.616
But set aside your grievances.

52:45.120 --> 52:47.247
if not for the sake of the crown...

52:48.331 --> 52:50.458
then for the sake of this old man

52:51.459 --> 52:53.962
who loves you all

52:53.962 --> 52:55.589
so dearly.

53:22.574 --> 53:25.619
I wish to raise my cup
to Her Grace, the Queen.

53:29.748 --> 53:31.499
I love my father.

53:32.208 --> 53:34.753
But I must admit that no one has stood...

53:35.670 --> 53:38.173
more loyally by his side
than his good wife.

53:41.426 --> 53:43.345
She has tended to him with...

53:44.429 --> 53:46.598
unfailing devotion,

53:46.598 --> 53:49.225
love, and honor.

53:50.602 --> 53:53.146
And for that, she has my gratitude...

53:55.023 --> 53:56.566
and my apology.

54:05.867 --> 54:08.745
Your graciousness moves me deeply, Princess.

54:12.123 --> 54:13.875
We are both mothers...

54:16.378 --> 54:18.296
and we love our children.

54:21.675 --> 54:24.594
We have more in common
than we sometimes allow.

54:27.806 --> 54:31.351
I raise my cup to you and to your house.

54:36.398 --> 54:38.400
You will make a fine queen.

55:14.352 --> 55:15.478
I...

55:16.563 --> 55:19.107
I regret the disappointment
you are soon to suffer.

55:20.025 --> 55:23.445
But if you ever wish to know
what it is to be well satisfied,

55:23.445 --> 55:25.613
all you have to do is ask.

55:26.281 --> 55:27.198
Jace.

55:56.019 --> 56:00.190
To Prince Aegon and Prince Aemond.

56:00.190 --> 56:03.568
We have not seen each other in years,

56:03.568 --> 56:06.404
but I have fond memories
of our shared youth.

56:08.823 --> 56:12.744
And as men, I hope we may
yet be friends and allies.

56:13.870 --> 56:16.414
To you and your family's
good health, dear uncles.

56:24.339 --> 56:25.632
To you as well.

56:33.306 --> 56:35.725
Beware the beast beneath the boards.

56:35.809 --> 56:37.227
Well done, my boy.

56:37.227 --> 56:40.063
I would like to toast to Baela and Rhaena.

56:40.688 --> 56:42.607
They'll be married soon.

56:43.775 --> 56:46.903
It isn't so bad.
Mostly he just ignores you...

56:48.154 --> 56:50.031
except sometimes when he's drunk.

56:58.581 --> 57:01.876
- Good.
- Let us have some music.

57:07.215 --> 57:08.466
Excuse me.

58:40.225 --> 58:42.769
Guards.

58:50.026 --> 58:51.319
Please, sit down.

59:30.900 --> 59:32.235
Final tribute.

59:35.321 --> 59:37.240
To the health of my nephews:

59:38.199 --> 59:39.284
Jace...

59:40.827 --> 59:41.995
Luke...

59:43.079 --> 59:44.205
and Joffrey.

59:45.707 --> 59:49.043
Each of them handsome, wise...

59:56.301 --> 59:57.719
- strong.
- Aemond.

59:57.719 --> 59:58.928
Come...

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:04.225
let us drain our cups to these three...

1:00:04.976 --> 1:00:07.145
- Strong boys.
- I dare you to say that again.

1:00:07.145 --> 1:00:10.315
Why? 'Twas only a compliment.

1:00:10.315 --> 1:00:11.774
Do you not think yourself Strong?

1:00:12.650 --> 1:00:14.694
- Jace!
- That is enough!

1:00:21.617 --> 1:00:23.619
Why would you say such a thing
before these people?

1:00:23.703 --> 1:00:26.873
I was merely expressing how proud I am
of my family, Mother.

1:00:26.873 --> 1:00:30.710
Mm, though it seems my nephews
aren't quite as proud of theirs.

1:00:30.710 --> 1:00:32.712
Wait, wait!

1:00:36.299 --> 1:00:39.427
Go to your quarters.
All of you go, now.

1:00:58.237 --> 1:00:59.364
Rhaenyra.

1:01:03.826 --> 1:01:06.454
It's best, I think,
if we go back to Dragonstone.

1:01:06.454 --> 1:01:08.456
You've only just arrived.

1:01:14.545 --> 1:01:16.464
Let me see the children home.

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:18.674
I'll...

1:01:20.093 --> 1:01:21.844
return on dragonback.

1:01:26.224 --> 1:01:28.142
The King and I would both like that.

1:02:09.976 --> 1:02:13.104
It's been quite a night
at the castle, it seems.

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:15.982
Yes, my lady.

1:02:50.808 --> 1:02:52.727
Come on, come on.

1:02:56.272 --> 1:02:58.816
That's it.

1:03:07.825 --> 1:03:08.951
Oh...

1:03:10.328 --> 1:03:11.454
Well done.

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:20.630
- I'm sorry.
- Shh.

1:03:20.630 --> 1:03:23.633
- I'm sorry.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1:03:25.218 --> 1:03:27.136
But you wanted to know...

1:03:28.137 --> 1:03:30.264
if I believe it to be true.

1:03:32.183 --> 1:03:34.101
Believe what to be true, my King?

1:03:35.019 --> 1:03:36.771
Don't you remember?

1:03:38.481 --> 1:03:39.607
Aegon...

1:03:42.318 --> 1:03:43.569
Our son?

1:03:45.738 --> 1:03:47.281
His Dream.

1:03:47.865 --> 1:03:51.160
The Song of Ice... and Fi--

1:03:52.495 --> 1:03:54.038
It is true.

1:03:55.081 --> 1:03:56.999
What he saw in the North.

1:03:59.502 --> 1:04:01.629
The Prince That Was Promised.

1:04:02.713 --> 1:04:03.923
I don't understand, Viserys.

1:04:05.466 --> 1:04:07.051
The Prince.

1:04:07.051 --> 1:04:08.678
Prince Aegon?

1:04:09.971 --> 1:04:11.764
To unite the realm

1:04:11.764 --> 1:04:14.976
against the cold... and the dark.

1:04:18.729 --> 1:04:20.273
It is you.

1:04:23.025 --> 1:04:24.569
You are the one.

1:04:26.696 --> 1:04:28.614
You must do this.

1:04:30.366 --> 1:04:32.285
You must do this.

1:05:16.954 --> 1:05:18.873
I understand, my King.

1:05:39.143 --> 1:05:40.353
No more.

1:05:41.228 --> 1:05:42.772
No more.

1:06:11.759 --> 1:06:13.260
<i>My love.</i>
