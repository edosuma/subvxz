{\an8}it's not okay.

34:06.043 --> 34:07.795
{\an1}It's like you all
are talking behind my back.

34:07.879 --> 34:08.963
Like, really? Stop.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.465
Did you get a lighter yet?

34:10.547 --> 34:13.509
{\an1}'Cause they said
there's one out here.

34:13.592 --> 34:14.469
{\an1}Alright.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.137
Please sit down
just for one second.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.972
{\an1}No.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.056
No. No.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.016
- You guys leaving?
- Get outta here.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.226
- Yeah.
- Ron.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.771
Ron, come here.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.188
Come right now.

34:30.777 --> 34:31.985
Just sit here.

34:32.069 --> 34:34.237
{\an1}'Cause I'm really [bleep]
pissed off right now.

34:34.322 --> 34:36.449
- At me? For what?
- Sit.

34:38.117 --> 34:41.161
{\an1}'I'm sitting with Mike,
and Mike is saying'

34:41.245 --> 34:44.540
{\an1}you know, "Jionni and Nicole
are fighting," whatever.

34:44.623 --> 34:47.543
{\an1}And you go to Mike,
"Do what you gotta do."

34:47.627 --> 34:48.753
(Jenni)
Yes.

34:48.835 --> 34:50.880
{\an1}So he was prepared
to fight the whole night.

34:50.963 --> 34:52.005
- Wait, what?
- Because of you.

34:52.089 --> 34:53.966
{\an1}Everyone's telling
Mike to fight Jionni.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.467
- Yep.
- I wanna ask you?

34:55.551 --> 34:57.345
{\an1}Yes, he wanted
to fight Jionni, yes.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.055
{\an1}I told him,
"Do what you gotta do."

34:59.138 --> 35:00.223
- What am I supposed to [bleep].
- "Do what you gotta do." What?

35:00.306 --> 35:02.642
{\an1}To make yourself feel better.
How much...

35:02.725 --> 35:04.852
{\an1}So you wanted
to kick him in the face.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.938
And everybody else is saying,
"Just kick him in the face."

35:07.021 --> 35:09.524
{\an1}How do I have to get
involved in that, Snooki?

35:09.607 --> 35:10.900
'Like, I'm done with it.'

35:10.983 --> 35:12.568
{\an1}I'm not dealing with this
bull[bleep] no more.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.778
{\an5}<i>(Ronnie)</i>
<i>Mike just wants</i>
<i>to stir the pot.</i>

35:13.861 --> 35:16.531
{\an8}And then I get [bleep]
worked into this drama

35:16.614 --> 35:17.907
{\an8}that I don't need.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.700
{\an7}<i>I wanna worry</i>
<i>about myself at this point.</i>

35:19.784 --> 35:22.620
{\an1}I can help everyone else
out as much as I can.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.789
- I understand.
- But.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.791
{\an1}If that [bleep]
starts to affect my life

35:26.874 --> 35:28.501
I can't do it, Snook.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.211
{\an1}- Don't even with me right now.
- Come here.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.045
{\an1}- Come here, come here.
- Don't even with me right now.

35:31.128 --> 35:32.964
I don't want to yell
or scream.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.466
I don't wanna scream
or yell at you.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.717
So come here. Gimme a hug.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.052
{\an1}- I don't wanna yell at you.
- Just stop.

35:38.135 --> 35:38.553
I don't wanna scream at you.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.513
{\an3}Look at me.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.890
Relax.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.600
{\an7}<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>the [bleep] to do right now.</i>

35:44.684 --> 35:47.103
{\an8}<i>I feel like</i>
<i>nobody has my back.</i>

35:47.186 --> 35:48.896
{\an7}This is probably
the worst I've ever felt

35:48.980 --> 35:50.147
{\an8}living with my roommates.

35:51.566 --> 35:55.152
{\an7}I'll just [bleep] go to bed
and sleep until I [bleep] leave.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.959
{\an1}- That was so unnecessary.
- Why do you do that?

36:10.042 --> 36:11.085
{\an8}But that's him,
and I accept it.

36:11.168 --> 36:13.254
{\an1}- No.
- He does it to everybody.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.923
Yeah, yeah, Mike.
You're like a rat.

36:16.007 --> 36:19.260
{\an1}It's not like I did,
did it, like, intentional.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.679
'It was a conversation.
A drunk conversation.'

36:21.762 --> 36:23.973
{\an1}But you're gonna lose
Nicole as a friend.

36:24.056 --> 36:26.267
{\an1}No, I won't. No, I won't.
None of us will.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.852
{\an1}You really
don't think you won't?

36:27.935 --> 36:28.936
No.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.271
{\an1}She will choose Jionni
over anybody.

36:30.354 --> 36:33.024
{\an1}So when Nicole
was [bleep] me, right

36:33.107 --> 36:34.942
{\an1}watching her girlfriend
get [bleep], right...

36:35.026 --> 36:36.736
{\an1}- Are you [bleep] kidding me?
- No, I'm serious.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.279
And you expect her
to be your friend?

36:38.362 --> 36:38.946
{\an1}Why are you her friend
if you're, like

36:39.030 --> 36:40.239
saying [bleep] like that?

36:40.323 --> 36:43.075
{\an1}No, no, no, you're saying
he chose him or...

36:43.159 --> 36:44.160
No. There's no such thing.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.078
You expect her
to be your friend?

36:46.162 --> 36:48.956
You said something like that,
but you want to be her friend?

36:49.040 --> 36:51.125
{\an1}You're, you're telling me,
"Oh, he chose somebody."

36:51.208 --> 36:53.794
No, no, no. No, no, no.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.172
{\an1}You're talking about my best
friend giving you [bleep]?

36:56.255 --> 36:58.215
Somebody talk to...
Well, she did that.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.598
{\an1}So when Nicole
was [bleep] me, right

37:05.681 --> 37:07.600
{\an1}watching her girlfriend
get [bleep], right...

37:07.683 --> 37:09.226
{\an1}- Are you [bleep] kidding me?
- No, I'm serious.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.062
And you expect her
to be your friend?

37:11.145 --> 37:13.397
{\an1}You're talking about my best
friend giving you [bleep]?

37:13.481 --> 37:14.899
Well, she did that.

37:14.982 --> 37:16.233
{\an1}You just saying
what you just said

37:16.317 --> 37:17.902
is just, it's like,
"What the [bleep]?"

37:17.985 --> 37:19.362
Like, why would you
[bleep] say that?

37:19.445 --> 37:20.905
{\an8}I'm mortified, like

37:20.988 --> 37:22.990
{\an8}I am so mortified
at how disgusting

37:23.074 --> 37:24.325
{\an8}this guy is right now.

37:24.408 --> 37:26.327
{\an7}<i>Like, Mike,</i>
<i>how does that make you look?</i>

37:26.410 --> 37:27.495
{\an8}You [bleep] idiot.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.704
{\an8}Like, you're an ass[bleep].

37:28.788 --> 37:30.164
{\an1}Yeah, I've had enough
of this, dude.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.166
I'm done. I'm not arguing.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.376
I'm not fighting with nobody.

37:33.459 --> 37:34.168
I love frankly
this time of year.

37:34.251 --> 37:36.837
Me, too. It's my favorite.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.839
Ah, geez.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.967
[instrumental music]

37:45.346 --> 37:46.639
I need food.

37:48.307 --> 37:49.725
I'm gonna eat something.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.894
[music continues]

37:58.275 --> 37:59.777
{\an1}- Hey, do you want to cuddle?
- Mm-mm.

37:59.860 --> 38:02.405
You're such a bad time.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.038
{\an3}[giggles]

38:19.880 --> 38:23.384
{\an7}I'll squeeze in with Vinny.
You go with Pauly.

38:23.467 --> 38:26.178
{\an1}Vin, can I squeeze in
with you for two seconds?

38:27.346 --> 38:28.889
Are you being a poop?

38:30.141 --> 38:30.307
{\an3}Aw.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.145

38:40.484 --> 38:42.403
{\an7}What do I do, [bleep]
throw her out of the room?

38:42.486 --> 38:42.528
{\an8}<i>No.</i>

{\an8}Not gonna happen.
Go to your bed.
