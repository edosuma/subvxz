MAKING SCENTS OF LOVE

00:08.209 --> 00:11.345
[tense whirring jingle]

00:11.645 --> 00:14.848
[lighthearted piano music]

00:38.906 --> 00:39.840
Good evening.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.109
Good evening.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.046
George is quite the host, isn't he?

00:46.947 --> 00:47.881
Are you a friend?

00:48.048 --> 00:48.882
Of George's?

00:49.950 --> 00:51.585
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You could say that.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.355
George is my godfather.

00:55.055 --> 00:55.889
Oh.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.361
You smell amazing.

01:00.427 --> 01:01.562
May I? Just...

01:03.030 --> 01:04.231
-[whimsical music] -[Shay sniffs]

01:04.265 --> 01:08.369
Mm. Oh, wow. I'm getting top notes of ambergris.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.404
Do you know where ambergris comes from?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.072
-Uh-- -[Shay] It's the digestive

01:12.239 --> 01:14.208
system of a sperm whale.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.142
It's a true story.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.412
Oh, don't worry. No, they don't use it anymore.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.247
Now it's just labdanum.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.753
I'm also getting cardamom, and...Mm-hm.

01:25.986 --> 01:29.223
Sort of a middle note of peach and...

01:30.224 --> 01:31.125
Orange blossom.

01:31.225 --> 01:34.428
Wow, someone has expensive taste.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.630
How do you know so much about perfume?

01:37.598 --> 01:38.932
I'm an organic chemist.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.435
I- I specialize in designing fragrances.

01:42.069 --> 01:42.970
Do you have a store?

01:43.437 --> 01:44.405
I used to.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.140
We sort of went bankrupt,

01:46.240 --> 01:49.443
but now I'm designing exclusively for private clients.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.579
[Darian] Shay's also working on a very prestigious project...

01:52.946 --> 01:53.947
The first known perfume.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.750
The recipe has gone missing over time. [chuckles]

01:57.084 --> 01:59.086
If Shay can crack this mysterious puzzle,

01:59.153 --> 02:01.855
it'll be very, very lucrative.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.191
Also, spoiler alert.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.826
[whispers] It might be a love potion.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.028
Oh, it's not a love potion. It could be a love potion.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.630
Definitely... not.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.632
Let me guess. Do you two know each other?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.368
We just met earlier.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.703
We were chatting. Uh...

02:15.803 --> 02:17.371
But hey, enough about me.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.473
How do you know the host?

02:20.874 --> 02:21.775
I am the host.

02:23.877 --> 02:24.878
Your name is George?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.147
Grade school was problematic.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.018
This is your party!

02:31.285 --> 02:33.187
[Shay chuckles]

02:33.287 --> 02:34.188
Oh, wow.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.123
You are definitely not my godfather.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.558
Shay!

02:37.891 --> 02:39.660
Why did you take off your catering uniform?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.195
Uh...

02:44.064 --> 02:45.165
Enjoy your party!

02:45.232 --> 02:48.836
-[Shay chuckles] -[lighthearted music]

02:50.204 --> 02:53.040
[Shay] A woman named George? What are the chances?

02:53.207 --> 02:54.641
Hey, I have an Uncle Meredith.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.377
You need to do better research with the guest list

02:56.477 --> 02:58.679
so I don't end up looking like a fool.

02:58.746 --> 02:59.913
I don't need any help with that.

03:00.013 --> 03:04.518
And can you please stop with this love potion bologna?

03:04.852 --> 03:05.919
You can't possibly believe that.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.187
I'm not ruling it out.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.689
Besides, it doesn't really matter.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.190
It's just a selling tool.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.526
We get somebody to invest in you...

03:12.826 --> 03:14.495
You get your grandma's store back,

03:14.528 --> 03:16.397
I get my modeling career on track.

03:16.563 --> 03:19.032
We're rich, we meet our soulmates, we're happy.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.702
-End of story. -Sounds amazing.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.537
The fact is it's not realistic.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.707
You have to have the courage to follow your dream.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.509
Yeah, I tried that once. Remember?

03:28.575 --> 03:29.743
Turned out to be a nightmare.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.546
Okay, but if you truly believe in something enough,

03:32.679 --> 03:34.681
it will probably come true.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.583
This is my life we're talking about.

03:36.850 --> 03:37.684
Not the tooth fairy.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.523
[whimsical music]

03:42.723 --> 03:44.858
[Shay] Wrong mailbox again.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.228
Come on!

03:50.798 --> 03:53.066
[Wilma] Don't call my sister stupid!

03:53.133 --> 03:54.802
She's a very intelligent woman!

03:54.902 --> 03:55.736
[Wilma] No, she's not.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.237
She's stupid because she married that guy.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.539
[Wilma] Oh, for Pete's sake!

03:58.572 --> 04:00.107
[Ken] Well, you know what he's like!

04:00.240 --> 04:01.742
[Wilma] Quit your bellyaching-

04:01.809 --> 04:05.112
-Okay. In we go. -[couple continue arguing]

04:06.213 --> 04:08.782
Anymore emails from the archeological society?

04:08.882 --> 04:09.817
Several.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.752
Nothing on the ancient perfume recipe.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.253
Well, there's only so many ingredients.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.755
Can't you just make it up?

04:14.988 --> 04:16.423
That's not how science works.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.926
There are literally thousands of possible ingredients,

04:18.959 --> 04:20.461
not to mention different potencies,

04:20.594 --> 04:21.962
the order of the recipe.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.765
Every perfume has a specific architecture.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.300
Top, middle, base.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.335
Sounds a little sexy. [Darian chuckles]

04:28.602 --> 04:30.938
Okay, but if you could just figure out this recipe,

04:31.004 --> 04:32.105
then we can market it,

04:32.272 --> 04:33.941
then all of our problems are gonna be solved!

04:34.007 --> 04:36.643
No, no, no. I am not trying to crack this ancient perfume

04:36.743 --> 04:38.579
recipe so it can be mass marketed.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.781
Every scent should be specifically designed

04:40.914 --> 04:41.782
for a certain person.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.016
You know that!

04:43.116 --> 04:45.285
I heard there was a store around here that did that.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.453
Yeah, oh!

04:46.520 --> 04:49.623
But it went outta business, for the exact same reason.

04:49.756 --> 04:50.624
Wow, okay.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.526
What happened to, "Follow your dreams, Shay!"

04:52.626 --> 04:54.628
Following your dreams is one thing,

04:54.795 --> 04:56.864
total delusion, yeah, that's another.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.799
Which one does your modeling career fall under?

04:58.832 --> 05:00.801
[chuckles] Okay, okay.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.003
You know what? You got me.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.639
[whimsical music]

05:05.772 --> 05:07.708
But if you're not trying to figure out this recipe

05:07.808 --> 05:09.042
to make a little bit of money,

05:09.142 --> 05:11.445
then why are you wasting all your time on this?

05:11.512 --> 05:13.881
Because it was my grandmother's hobby.

05:14.281 --> 05:16.016
It was a puzzle that she was never able to solve,

05:16.116 --> 05:18.185
and working on it makes me feel closer to her.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.653
If she couldn't decipher this,

05:19.686 --> 05:21.889
then maybe it's not meant to be deciphered.

05:28.195 --> 05:31.865
[Darian] Brad and Allison are getting married?

05:32.199 --> 05:34.401
And they invited you to the wedding?!

05:34.668 --> 05:36.336
What a couple of psychopaths!

05:38.171 --> 05:39.373
You're not going to this?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.743
No, of course not. I'm gonna send a gift.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.710
A gift?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.145
Shay!

05:45.312 --> 05:46.847
When your ex-boyfriend

05:46.980 --> 05:49.683
and former second best friend get married,

05:49.716 --> 05:51.518
you don't send them a gift.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.753
Are you okay?

05:53.520 --> 05:54.922
It's been 16 months, I'm fine.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.190
[Daian] You know what, okay...

05:57.491 --> 05:58.559
Oh.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.227
You have Mrs. Miller tomorrow.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.194
-[Darian] Okay? We met her -Right.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.330
at that uh... neighborhood watch luncheon

06:03.363 --> 06:04.197
that we catered.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.199
Heads up, she's a nightmare.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.267
A total Karen.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.403
Her name is literally Karen.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.943
-Great. -[whimsical music]

06:17.177 --> 06:19.446
You're not delusional. And I love you.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.181
I love you too.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.121
You're not delusional either.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.222
Okay, good.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.424
Started to think I was.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.934
[tense whimsical music]

06:41.401 --> 06:42.869
[Amy sniffs]

06:43.136 --> 06:44.738
Oh.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.644
[Amy sniffs]

06:50.811 --> 06:52.245
[Amy] Ugh!

06:52.613 --> 06:53.447
Jorgenson.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.248
You were supposed to bring me the juice!

06:55.382 --> 06:56.917
Instead, you brought me this sewer water.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.085
[Jorgenson awkwardly chuckles]

06:58.118 --> 06:59.386
Ms. Song.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.789
With respect, these samples are from

07:02.923 --> 07:05.926
some of the top perfumers in the entire world.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.794
You mean the ones that weren't already snapped up

07:07.894 --> 07:08.929
by our competitors?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.430
[Amy] Go stand in the corner.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.271
The Fab Four of Fashion

07:18.305 --> 07:23.443
are shoes, bags, sunglasses, and perfume.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.780
Perfume is Paul, you know why?

07:27.748 --> 07:29.616
Because it makes you think of yesterday?

07:30.517 --> 07:32.085
Because it's the most accessible.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.856
Not everybody can afford a $3,000 bag,

07:35.989 --> 07:38.025
but they will buy a bottle of perfume.

07:39.626 --> 07:43.764
We have several very successful fragrance lines,

07:43.830 --> 07:46.166
but not one of them makes us an industry leader.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.200
Huh.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.702
Well, as the new guy,

07:48.935 --> 07:51.104
can I ask what would make a scent the industry leader?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.373
Well, that scent would need to--

07:53.473 --> 07:56.376
[Jorgenson] A scent, should invoke...

07:57.477 --> 08:01.148
a feeling of endless endearment.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.652
-[whispers] Sorry. -Thank you, Jorgenson.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.121
And it would have--

08:08.188 --> 08:11.992
[Jorgenson] It should leave a sillage of deep desire.

08:12.059 --> 08:15.062
The... elixir of adoration,

08:15.328 --> 08:20.367
a scent distilled down to the purest essence of romance.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.704
Very good, Jorgenson.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.472
So, love.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.241
You're talking about bottling the scent of love.

08:28.542 --> 08:29.509
Why don't you just do that?

08:29.576 --> 08:31.645
Because it's not possible.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.013
[Jorgenson] It can't be done.

08:34.748 --> 08:39.019
[chuckles] It's- it's the white whale of fragrances. Alright?

08:39.086 --> 08:40.587
If we could "bottle" love,

08:41.221 --> 08:44.257
we would all have villas on Mars right now, all right?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.027
This... Way to embarrass yourself.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.195
With all due respect,

08:48.228 --> 08:49.996
I'm not the one who got sent to the corner.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.866
[whimsical music]

08:54.000 --> 08:54.868
[chuckles]

08:55.168 --> 08:56.570
Austin, do you know why I hired you?

08:56.703 --> 08:57.871
Yup. ZipRecruiter.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.206
That's right, ZipRecruiter.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.207
You may be my nephew,

09:00.373 --> 09:01.775
but I've never been close to your mother,

09:01.875 --> 09:04.211
and I wouldn't have hired you had I known you were my nephew.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.713
You worked your way up from the mail room,

09:07.047 --> 09:09.182
all the way up to being my executive assistant.

09:09.616 --> 09:10.550
You're smart.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.588
But making silly suggestions like "bottling love"

09:14.855 --> 09:16.857
isn't gonna get you very far in this industry.

09:16.923 --> 09:17.924
Well, that's okay.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.259
I'm a photographer, remember?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.795
[Amy] Photography's a hobby, not a career.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.230
Right.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.566
Well, at least that's one thing

09:26.733 --> 09:28.068
you have in common with my mother.

09:30.036 --> 09:32.606
Um, I should probably get back to the office.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.908
We have the car service waiting for you outside.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.877
Oh, no, it's fine. I'd rather walk.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.078
Enjoy the fresh air.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.881
Oh, see you tonight?

09:41.548 --> 09:42.215
Hm?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.483
It's your birthday.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.752
Oh, right, that.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.953
See ya, Jorgenson.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.457
[whimsical music]

10:01.268 --> 10:02.602
[gasps]

10:03.904 --> 10:07.440
[upbeat music]

10:15.315 --> 10:16.149
Yeah.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.287
Okay.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.626
Oh, sorry.

10:26.693 --> 10:27.360
-[shutter snaps] -Hey!

10:27.460 --> 10:28.295
Sorry.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.297
Sorry!

10:30.964 --> 10:31.798
Sorry.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.841
[tense music]

10:53.353 --> 10:55.455
-Hey! -Hey!

10:55.622 --> 10:56.957
You're two months behind on rent.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.158
Yeah, you know what?

10:59.125 --> 11:00.327
I'm gonna settle up tomorrow.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.194
-Okay. -I promise.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.162
You said that yesterday.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.196
Right.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.198
And uh, there's somebody here to see you?

11:05.365 --> 11:08.902
I shouldn't have let her in, but she scared me.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.170
-Okay... -Okay?

11:10.237 --> 11:13.340
And as the world's greatest dungeon master, I...

11:15.008 --> 11:15.909
I don't scare easily.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.878
Okay. I'm gonna take care of that.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.012
Okay, and then-

11:19.112 --> 11:21.848
And then, eventually, I'm gonna take care of the rent.

11:22.015 --> 11:22.983
Thank you!

11:23.984 --> 11:27.254
[tense whimsical music]

11:30.023 --> 11:31.424
-[Shay] Hi. -You're late.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.026
-Yeah, um... -I was told I'd

11:33.059 --> 11:35.061
be getting a boutique experience

11:35.528 --> 11:36.363
You...

11:36.396 --> 11:38.531
Well, yeah, uh this is...

11:38.865 --> 11:40.400
This is a boutique.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.535
Boutique experience.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.570
-Is it? -Mhm.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.071
-Hm. -[Shay] Sorry.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.208
The door just...[bangs]

11:48.575 --> 11:49.709
Just sticks a little.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.344
Come on in!

11:52.045 --> 11:55.448
[warm lighthearted music]

11:58.752 --> 12:00.587
Please, come on in. Uhm.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.756
You can uh- you can have a seat right here.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.593
Okay, so, why don't we get started?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.695
Can you...

12:08.862 --> 12:11.431
[whimsical music]

12:11.598 --> 12:14.634
[Shay] Tell me just a little bit about why

12:14.734 --> 12:16.369
you would like to get a fragrance?

12:16.870 --> 12:17.704
[Karen] Uh...

12:19.906 --> 12:21.474
It's my hubby's birthday.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.309
Oh.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.977
I wanna get myself a perfume.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.247
Me smelling nice is a gift to him.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.082
Right.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.818
Okay, let's start with just a few questions.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.587
What is your favorite color?

12:35.221 --> 12:36.056
Blue.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.590
It reminds me of Chad.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.592
Oh, that's nice.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.127
Are his eyes blue?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.263
No, his police uniform is.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.466
Okay. Uh...

12:46.833 --> 12:48.134
What's your favorite food?

12:48.435 --> 12:49.436
[whimsical music]

12:49.602 --> 12:54.307
Listen, when your friend insisted that I come see you,

12:54.407 --> 12:56.609
there was no mention of an interrogation.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.011
-Okay? -Oh no, no, no, no, no.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.280
This is all part of the brief.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.681
-The brief? -Yes, the brief.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.416
I need to get to know you a little bit,

13:03.450 --> 13:05.118
so that I can create a perfume

13:05.185 --> 13:07.287
that perfectly captures your...

13:08.688 --> 13:09.522
essence.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.458
My essence?

13:11.524 --> 13:12.459
Yeah.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.795
I'm sensing French.

13:15.829 --> 13:16.796
French?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.431
It's very chic.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.432
I'm pretty chic.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.868
Okay, I'll stay for a minute.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.971
[Karen] Chad used to buy me tulips.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.973
When we first started dating, [chuckles]

13:27.140 --> 13:30.176
he used to call them "simply because" flowers.

13:30.710 --> 13:31.945
-Aww. -And they would arrive,

13:32.012 --> 13:33.046
and they'd have a little card,

13:33.146 --> 13:36.816
and they would say, "Simply because I love you."

13:37.450 --> 13:38.818
That's really romantic.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.153
I don't know.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.957
Okay. I think I've got everything I need.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.892
Why don't you come back in a few days,

13:45.992 --> 13:47.494
and I will have your fragrance ready.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.229
-What? -[whimsical music]

13:49.329 --> 13:51.064
I have to come back for the perfume?

13:51.331 --> 13:52.999
[Karen laughs] Okay, that's ridiculous.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.667
Do you have a manager?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.203
Do I look like I have a manager?

13:57.337 --> 13:58.705
[Karen incredulously laughs]

13:58.872 --> 14:00.807
Okay, wow.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.509
-[Karen laughs] -Karen...

14:06.413 --> 14:07.480
Well, that was brief.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.188
[calming piano music]

14:26.499 --> 14:28.535
[cell phone rings]

14:29.002 --> 14:30.670
-[sighs] -[ringing continues]

14:32.705 --> 14:33.373
Hey.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.375
I just got some fantastic news!

14:35.442 --> 14:36.943
Tom Ford followed you on Insta?

14:37.043 --> 14:37.877
[Darian] I wish. No,

14:37.911 --> 14:39.179
we have a catering gig tonight.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.681
I convinced Marty to give you a second chance,

14:42.215 --> 14:45.018
and you will never believe whose birthday it is.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.388
We're going to Amy Song's house!

14:48.788 --> 14:49.889
[Darian] It's fate, Shay!

14:50.223 --> 14:51.691
I don't believe in fate.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.892
[Darian] Well, you should.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.129
This is your chance to make her a fragrance sample, and

14:56.229 --> 14:58.064
-show her how brilliant you are. -Wait, wh--

14:58.431 --> 15:00.733
Then maybe she could invest in you.

15:00.867 --> 15:01.968
-Whoa, whoa, hey-- -[Darian] Work your magic

15:02.068 --> 15:04.370
-and meet me tonight. -[phone hangs up]

15:05.071 --> 15:09.242
[lighthearted guitar music]

15:54.354 --> 15:57.257
[wind blows]

15:59.692 --> 16:02.529
[bottles clinking]

16:20.880 --> 16:23.616
[wondrous music]

16:30.223 --> 16:32.225
-Huh? [sighs] -[knocking on door]

16:32.392 --> 16:33.226
Okay.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.699
You fell asleep?

16:39.866 --> 16:41.668
-Shay, we are so late! -[Shay stuttering]

16:41.801 --> 16:43.803
Please tell me you at least made a sample for Amy?

16:43.903 --> 16:45.905
I don't know, I don't know, okay? I...

16:46.339 --> 16:47.340
I think so.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.008
Yeah. Look, hey!

16:49.175 --> 16:50.877
A bunch of stuff got mixed together, right?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.213
So I think this should be fine.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.581
Well, it'll have to do, all right?

16:54.681 --> 16:55.582
Find your nicest dress,

16:55.682 --> 16:57.183
and I'll make sure the Uber didn't bail.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.551
[Shay grunts]

16:59.152 --> 17:00.720
[whimsical music]

17:00.853 --> 17:04.490
[Marty] The catering code is to serve with invisibility.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.093
If you catch fire, you will burn quietly

17:07.193 --> 17:09.229
before asking a guest to extinguish you.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.530
Am I clear?

17:12.031 --> 17:12.865
Get to work.

17:17.570 --> 17:18.538
And you.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.740
You're only back because Darian said you

17:20.840 --> 17:23.243
could make a perfume for my nana.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.279
One mistake and you're gone.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.223
[Marty] And you...

17:38.424 --> 17:39.892
You're on shrimp puff duty.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.228
I'm a vegan.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.564
-[whimsical music] -[Shay] And...

17:46.399 --> 17:47.533
Okay.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.568
Sugar.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.407
Oh, cool.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.545
Nice.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.283
[whimsical music]

18:08.388 --> 18:09.222
-I just- -Oh!

18:09.255 --> 18:11.391
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:11.457 --> 18:12.925
I just saw Amy head upstairs.

18:13.059 --> 18:13.760
Go change!

18:13.826 --> 18:15.428
-What? I can't- -Do your thing,

18:15.561 --> 18:16.596
I'll do something.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.601
[whimsical music]

18:36.783 --> 18:37.784
-[whispering] You look great. -Yes?

18:37.817 --> 18:38.685
-You look great. -Okay.

18:39.118 --> 18:39.786
I told you,

18:39.852 --> 18:41.187
-I cannot walk in heels. -Okay.

18:41.321 --> 18:44.190
You're not gonna impress Amy Song wearing orthopedic shoes.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.127
Come on. Do you have your sample?

18:49.929 --> 18:51.597
[whimsical music]

18:51.664 --> 18:52.999
Okay, come on, let's go.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.300
Go, go, go, go!

18:54.434 --> 18:55.201
Okay.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.537
Around the corner, and up the stairs.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.638
Try and act normal.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.807
-Well, I'm terrible at that! -Okay.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.514
[lighthearted music]

19:16.289 --> 19:18.024
[sniffs]

19:23.162 --> 19:24.163
-Oh! -Oh, oh.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.898
Oh- oh!

19:25.998 --> 19:29.168
I am so, so sorry.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.370
-Are you okay? -Yeah, it's fine.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.139
I've had a drink spill on me bef...ore.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.008
[Shay] It's not a drink, it's perfume.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.978
Ugh. Oh my goodness.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.582
[lighthearted music] [Austin chuckles]

19:43.649 --> 19:44.650
Are you sure you're okay?

19:44.751 --> 19:46.052
Uh, no.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.421
[stutters] I mean, yes. Um...

19:50.423 --> 19:51.924
Have we met somewhere before?

19:52.859 --> 19:53.693
Pardon?

19:53.826 --> 19:55.661
I feel like I've met you somewhere.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.664
I don't think so.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.333
Maybe it's just fate then.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.534
[chuckles]

20:01.601 --> 20:03.870
Well, here you go.

20:04.170 --> 20:07.206
Hey uh, are you gonna be at the party for a while?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.041
Uh, well...

20:09.108 --> 20:12.445
It's um- yet to be determined.

20:12.678 --> 20:15.181
Well, hopefully we'll find each other again.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.217
Mhm. Okay.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.286
I'm so sorry.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.895
You disgust me.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.265
[tense piano music]

20:32.465 --> 20:33.933
[whispers] I'm sorry.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.868
I'll fix this.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.070
[sighs]

20:40.606 --> 20:41.741
Miss Song?

20:47.914 --> 20:49.048
Miss Song?

20:53.653 --> 20:56.722
[calming jazz music]

21:01.761 --> 21:04.263
[tense music]

21:11.404 --> 21:13.439
[Amy sighs]

21:34.360 --> 21:35.628
It's traditional for a person

21:35.695 --> 21:37.163
to attend their own birthday party.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.464
Everything okay?

21:38.664 --> 21:40.299
[Amy] Our stock is tanking.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.468
The board is hinting at replacing me,

21:42.969 --> 21:45.972
and I don't have a new perfume to launch the next quarter.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.308
What is that smell?

21:49.709 --> 21:51.611
Oh, it's um, perfume.

21:51.978 --> 21:52.778
Oh...

21:52.812 --> 21:54.313
It was a bit of an accident earlier.

21:55.481 --> 21:56.949
It's quite good, actually.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.118
Gonna be the scent of love?

21:59.952 --> 22:01.153
You know, I'd give my right arm

22:01.220 --> 22:02.321
if it were as simple as that.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.023
-[mannequin clatters] -[whimsical music]

22:06.158 --> 22:07.493
Um...[clears throat]

22:07.660 --> 22:10.830
Before you kick me out for hiding and spying on you, I,

22:12.298 --> 22:13.533
I know a master perfumer.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.169
She can design any scent you're looking for.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.840
Also, I'm a model.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.176
Classically trained.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.746
[Amy chuckles]

22:27.580 --> 22:28.748
You need a better photographer.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.216
Oh.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.217
[Marty] Dari!

22:32.151 --> 22:34.921
You abandoned the shrimp puff station.

22:36.255 --> 22:39.158
[whimsical music]

22:44.730 --> 22:46.032
Let me give you a hand.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.618
[Wilma] Who's at the door, Ken?

23:05.751 --> 23:08.120
[Ken] Only way to find out is to answer it.

23:08.421 --> 23:09.388
Ugh.

23:09.422 --> 23:10.423
Oh, Shay, hi.

23:10.556 --> 23:11.724
Evening, Wilma. Uh.

23:11.757 --> 23:12.558
Sorry to interrupt.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.060
The mail carrier mixed up our mail.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.062
-Again. Thank you. .-Yep.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.063
[Wilma] Here you go.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.532
I swear, you must have to fail an IQ test

23:19.565 --> 23:21.300
-to deliver mail around here. -Hi Ken.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.202
Well then, maybe you should apply.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.437
See what I have to deal with

23:24.537 --> 23:26.038
even after 50 years of marriage?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.373
Yeah, well, it's not officially

23:27.406 --> 23:29.308
50 years until next Wednesday, buddy,

23:29.408 --> 23:30.977
so you better play your cards right.

23:31.377 --> 23:32.144
I fold.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.145
[Wilma chuckles]

23:33.446 --> 23:34.280
What is that smell?

23:34.380 --> 23:36.282
[Wilma] Oh, you mean the botanical napalm?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.584
It's not us, it's like it's coming through the walls.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.620
We thought it might be your place?

23:40.987 --> 23:42.655
-[dramatic music] -Oh, no.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.291
[Shay] No, no, no, no, no!

23:46.492 --> 23:48.461
Ugh!

23:54.900 --> 23:56.102
Simply Because?

23:56.135 --> 23:57.770
Well, I named it after the flowers

23:57.937 --> 23:59.138
your husband used to bring you.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.342
[tense music]

24:06.178 --> 24:09.415
[wondrous music]

24:12.284 --> 24:15.287
[melancholic music]

24:19.458 --> 24:21.460
You turned over the rocks in my soul

24:21.494 --> 24:26.132
and found my most precious memory.

24:26.932 --> 24:28.300
I'm gonna bring my husband back.

24:29.268 --> 24:31.103
I want you to do the same thing for him.

24:31.137 --> 24:31.971
Okay.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.140
Are you the manager?

24:34.974 --> 24:36.475
Okay, I want you to know

24:36.542 --> 24:39.945
that she has a very special, special gift.

24:40.713 --> 24:41.614
Oh, come here!

24:41.714 --> 24:42.548
-[Karen shrieks] -[whimsical music]

24:42.648 --> 24:44.483
-Okay. -Thank you! Thank you!

24:44.550 --> 24:45.484
[Karen sniffs]

24:45.551 --> 24:47.687
[Karen laughs excitedly]

24:52.491 --> 24:54.994
Okay, I don't know what it is you got going on here,

24:55.061 --> 24:57.830
but you can't be doing business out of your unit.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.331
This isn't a public meeting place.

24:59.398 --> 25:02.368
Oh, really? Says the guy who hosts dorky Sword & Sorcery

25:02.468 --> 25:03.869
games here every week. I know about that.

25:03.969 --> 25:05.471
Okay, firstly, it's D&D.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.673
Secondly, there's nothing dorky about it.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.341
Thirdly, you should come and play,

25:09.408 --> 25:10.342
and you'll see how cool it is.

25:10.409 --> 25:12.211
[Shay chuckles] Okay, no thank you.

25:12.578 --> 25:14.413
Oh, there you are.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.347
I've been calling you all night.

25:15.414 --> 25:16.415
Why is your phone off?

25:16.515 --> 25:18.050
-My phone is off? -Who is th- What?

25:18.217 --> 25:19.585
This is unbelievable!

25:19.719 --> 25:22.254
I'm sorry, but is there a sign out front that says,

25:22.388 --> 25:23.689
"Lord of the Fries.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.559
The most awesome board game, burger joint ever?"

25:26.692 --> 25:29.061
No! Because this is a storage facility.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.397
You come, you store your stuff, and then you leave.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.698
There's no meetings allowed!

25:32.765 --> 25:33.833
Hey, Vik...

25:33.866 --> 25:36.035
Remember when you completely forgot your daughter's

25:36.102 --> 25:37.369
Sweet 16th birthday party,

25:37.536 --> 25:39.371
and I made you that incredible perfume

25:39.505 --> 25:41.440
at the very last second, totally saved your butt.

25:42.007 --> 25:44.210
Her 17th birthday's coming up around now, right?

25:45.211 --> 25:46.345
Oh, wow.

25:47.046 --> 25:47.880
Okay.

25:49.615 --> 25:51.217
Fine, fine.

25:51.617 --> 25:53.119
-One more month. -Okay.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.453
One more month.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.892
I have amazing news.

25:59.925 --> 26:00.793
Hey, I am not in the mood

26:00.893 --> 26:02.561
for any more of your amazing news.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.730
Okay, well, I got you a job.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.565
I don't wanna do any more catering jobs!

26:06.699 --> 26:12.571
It's not a catering job, it's a gig, with Amy Song!

26:12.872 --> 26:14.774
[tense music]

26:14.874 --> 26:15.941
Doing what?

26:16.909 --> 26:17.910
-[Darian chuckles] -[tense music]

26:17.977 --> 26:19.445
[Shay] So you signed me up to create

26:19.545 --> 26:20.980
the olfactory experience of love.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.414
I mean, why don't you just volunteer me

26:22.448 --> 26:24.550
to create a time machine, or invent cold fusion.

26:24.617 --> 26:26.285
Is that like an energy drink or something?

26:26.485 --> 26:30.422
Perfumers have been trying to bottle love since forever.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.224
What makes you think I can do it?

26:32.258 --> 26:34.059
Uh, because you're brilliant?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.428
This is how you're gonna get your store back.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.230
Can't you just recreate the sample

26:38.264 --> 26:39.431
that you brought to Amy's last night?

26:39.465 --> 26:42.268
I can't do that, because I spilled it, remember?

26:42.501 --> 26:43.769
Also, all my work got destroyed

26:43.903 --> 26:45.004
before I could make any notes.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.505
So, you can improvise!

26:46.605 --> 26:48.841
Take the meeting. What harm is it gonna do?

26:51.143 --> 26:51.977
Fine.

26:53.579 --> 26:54.747
When is it?

26:55.014 --> 26:56.415
Yeah, so, it's in five minutes.

26:56.515 --> 26:57.683
What? Where?

26:57.783 --> 26:58.784
Okay, now this is the part

26:58.851 --> 27:00.119
that's probably gonna make you the most mad,

27:00.186 --> 27:01.620
but I want you to remember, you love me,

27:01.687 --> 27:03.622
and please, keep an open mind.

27:03.956 --> 27:04.790
Where?

27:06.859 --> 27:09.295
[tense music]

27:12.298 --> 27:14.133
I haven't set foot in here since eviction day.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.801
-[Darian] And you'll be fine. -[Shay] What?

27:15.835 --> 27:17.036
Okay, just call me afterwards.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.504
Whoa, what? You're not coming?

27:18.604 --> 27:21.106
No, I have a cryogenic ice bath facial therapy,

27:21.173 --> 27:22.942
and I'm already so late, Shay!

27:23.475 --> 27:25.144
How much money are you spending on those things?

27:25.211 --> 27:27.680
Friends don't discuss money, okay? You'll be fine!

27:28.514 --> 27:30.649
[tense whimsical music]

27:30.716 --> 27:31.684
God.

27:39.024 --> 27:42.328
[tense wondrous music]

28:14.360 --> 28:15.361
Oh, no.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.499
[whimsical music]

28:20.599 --> 28:21.367
Hello again.

28:21.433 --> 28:22.268
Hi.

28:22.401 --> 28:25.037
Um... What a lovely surprise.

28:27.006 --> 28:28.607
Oh, you must be Shay.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.175
You must be Austin.

28:30.442 --> 28:31.343
That's right.

28:32.578 --> 28:35.114
So um, before we start, can--

28:37.349 --> 28:38.550
Can I get you something to drink?

28:38.617 --> 28:39.618
Coffee? Tea?

28:39.752 --> 28:40.753
Whatever you want.

28:41.220 --> 28:41.887
Water's fine.

28:41.921 --> 28:42.755
-Okay. -Mhm.

28:43.088 --> 28:45.057
Water it is. Coming right up.

28:45.090 --> 28:47.726
-[table clangs] -[fake laughs]

28:50.229 --> 28:52.731
[tense music]

29:03.409 --> 29:04.276
[Austin] One water.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.079
Oh, thank you.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.559
So...uh...

29:20.926 --> 29:22.261
You work for Amy Song.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.431
I do, but I'm really a photographer at heart.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.833
Ah, that's why you had your camera last night.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.001
Yeah.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.836
It's a... key tool for a photographer [chuckles].

29:30.936 --> 29:31.904
[Shay chuckles]

29:35.607 --> 29:37.242
So, I know you're looking for love.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.745
Uh, aren't we all?

29:40.245 --> 29:43.582
Right. Um, I mean the--the scent of love.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.951
Um.. I'm just not so sure that I can do that.

29:46.318 --> 29:49.355
Uh-well, what about that perfume you spilled on me before?

29:49.655 --> 29:51.290
I mean, Miss Song really liked it a lot.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.092
She did?

29:53.125 --> 29:53.959
Yeah.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.828
Yeah, and she doesn't like anything.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.763
If you could just reproduce that,

29:57.796 --> 29:58.964
I'm pretty sure it could sell.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.332
Right, it's just...

30:01.300 --> 30:02.968
You see, mass marketed fragrances

30:03.102 --> 30:05.137
just really aren't my thing, so I'm--

30:05.270 --> 30:06.305
Ah, speak of the devil.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.607
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me for a moment?

30:15.481 --> 30:19.051
[lighthearted piano music]

30:49.748 --> 30:50.682
[Austin] Of course.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.752
[sighs] My apologies.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.021
So, where were we?

30:56.522 --> 30:59.058
[tense music]

31:00.359 --> 31:01.193
I'll do it.

31:02.227 --> 31:03.729
Really? [laughs]

31:03.862 --> 31:06.031
Well, great. That's fantastic news.

31:08.767 --> 31:10.602
-Oh, sorry. -Oh, uh. Please, after you.

31:10.769 --> 31:11.837
Thank you.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.507
Thank you again, for doing this.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.609
Yeah, well, don't thank me yet.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.580
Will I see you tomorrow at the photo shoot?

31:22.214 --> 31:23.048
Photo shoot?

31:23.348 --> 31:24.883
Your friend Darian needs new publicity shots.

31:24.950 --> 31:25.851
Oh.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.686
And I jump at any chance to shoot photos.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.721
It's amazing how things work out, huh?

31:29.755 --> 31:32.391
Mhm, yeah, amazing how things work out.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.061
Well, um... thanks again.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.062
Okay, this is my--

31:37.129 --> 31:38.564
-Oh. -Oh.

31:38.630 --> 31:39.698
-After you. -No, no.

31:40.265 --> 31:41.867
I'm gonna... Yeah. Okay.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.368
[Shay] Bye.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.705
[lighthearted music]

31:50.909 --> 31:52.211
[Darian] Let me get this straight.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.580
Austin is the guy you happened to spill perfume on,

31:54.713 --> 31:55.747
he's giving you a job,

31:55.914 --> 31:57.082
and he's a photographer?

31:57.249 --> 31:59.485
This is the universe operating at its best.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.420
[Shay] No, no, no. There's something odd about this.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.088
About Austin? Nah, he's awesome.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.423
From the first moment that we met,

32:04.456 --> 32:06.758
he was acting like a puppy dog,

32:06.892 --> 32:09.595
all... I don't know, flustered and weird.

32:10.295 --> 32:12.097
Okay, the term is "smitten".

32:12.297 --> 32:14.900
Was he acting smitten with you, Shay?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.001
Yes.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.638
But I mean, not with me necessarily, just in general.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.174
Oh. Was someone else there?

32:23.175 --> 32:24.009
No...

32:24.109 --> 32:25.444
Well, then he was smitten with you!

32:25.477 --> 32:26.311
I doubt it.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.646
It doesn't make any sense!

32:27.746 --> 32:28.947
How could he feel that way so quickly?

32:28.981 --> 32:29.948
He doesn't even know me.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.517
Okay. [chuckles]

32:31.617 --> 32:33.418
Maybe you made a love potion.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.988
[wondrous music]

32:36.155 --> 32:40.025
That is actually a logical explanation.

32:42.861 --> 32:45.531
I thought you said you didn't believe in love potions.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.665
Well, I don't. I mean...

32:48.033 --> 32:49.301
I didn't, but...

32:50.302 --> 32:51.803
It's just because now I'm not so sure,

32:51.837 --> 32:54.106
there are some scientific theories that support it.

32:54.673 --> 32:55.507
Okay, all right.

32:55.841 --> 32:58.043
Let's say you created a love potion.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.112
-Let's cut to the bad part. -What?

33:00.212 --> 33:02.214
Th-the bad part is that people will be falling in love

33:02.314 --> 33:03.315
against their will.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.484
Okay, you and I have very different definitions

33:05.551 --> 33:06.652
of the word "bad".

33:07.319 --> 33:08.554
Find out what you did to make that sample,

33:08.654 --> 33:09.488
and make more of it.

33:09.555 --> 33:10.656
And let them sell it.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.324
This is everything we've ever wanted!

33:12.391 --> 33:13.892
What? Are you kidding me?

33:13.992 --> 33:16.495
I need to find out what I did so I can make an antidote.

33:16.695 --> 33:17.529
An antidote?

33:18.363 --> 33:19.831
-An antidote for love? -Yeah.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.366
Why would you do that?

33:21.466 --> 33:23.635
I cannot be responsible for people falling in love

33:23.735 --> 33:24.970
under false pretenses.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.005
It just leads to heartbreak.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.173
[whimsical music]

33:28.307 --> 33:29.174
Okay, Shay.

33:29.908 --> 33:32.211
Take the weight of the world on your shoulders,

33:32.878 --> 33:35.480
while I stand here in this hot garden.

33:36.048 --> 33:37.349
God, it's so hot.

33:38.650 --> 33:42.087
[tense whimsical music]

34:03.575 --> 34:04.409
Oh, no.

34:05.677 --> 34:10.716
"Reverse the effects of a love potion."

34:12.117 --> 34:12.951
Okay.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.757
"All you need to do is concoct an antidote.

34:19.124 --> 34:22.227
A love potion antidote is made by increasing the potency

34:22.361 --> 34:24.863
of each original recipe ingredient by 10."

34:29.134 --> 34:29.968
Okay.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.907
[Shay] Okay, so, that accidental perfume sample

34:36.074 --> 34:37.242
that I spilled on Austin at the party

34:37.309 --> 34:40.279
contained some of the relic perfume experiment.

34:40.379 --> 34:41.747
Okay, well, at least something good

34:41.780 --> 34:43.582
came of that total time suck.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.584
What if, and just by some fluke,

34:45.717 --> 34:48.620
the combination of that spill is the actual recipe?

34:48.720 --> 34:50.389
I mean, things like that have happened before, right?

34:50.422 --> 34:53.091
Okay, and what if the relic perfume is actually...

34:54.092 --> 34:54.926
A love potion?

34:55.260 --> 34:57.929
Okay, can we stop focusing on your issue for a second

34:57.996 --> 34:58.830
and focus on mine?

34:58.930 --> 34:59.731
What?

34:59.798 --> 35:02.401
I am experiencing a crisis right now.

35:02.467 --> 35:03.335
Oh, God. Not your,

35:03.468 --> 35:05.470
imagined puffy face thing again, please.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.272
Okay, it is not imagined.

35:07.339 --> 35:10.175
Acute facial bloating syndrome is a real medical condition

35:10.275 --> 35:11.943
that I've been diagnosed with.

35:15.747 --> 35:16.648
Why are you video calling me?

35:16.748 --> 35:18.784
Well, because I need to see your face. Answer.

35:25.023 --> 35:26.358
You look perfectly fine.

35:26.525 --> 35:29.328
Oh, don't comfort me with lies and deceit right now!

35:29.594 --> 35:31.863
Okay? I need you to distract Austin for like...

35:32.431 --> 35:33.332
a couple of hours.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.499
A couple of hours?

35:34.633 --> 35:37.202
[Darian] Shay! It's my big debut!

35:38.136 --> 35:40.272
-[whimsical music] -[grunts]

35:48.880 --> 35:50.215
-[Shay] Hey. -Hey.

35:50.816 --> 35:51.983
So, Darian's gonna be late.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.486
Oh, okay. Uh...

35:54.653 --> 35:56.621
Well, why don't I take your photo while we wait?

35:56.855 --> 35:59.291
No, oh, no, no. Not very photogenic.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.826
[Amy] What is going on here?

36:01.159 --> 36:02.461
[Austin] Oh, hey Aunt Amy.

36:03.061 --> 36:05.230
I mean, Miss Song. Um...

36:05.897 --> 36:07.966
Sorry, I was just helping Darian with a photo shoot.

36:07.999 --> 36:08.834
[Amy] Darian?

36:09.067 --> 36:10.502
-Oh, shrimp puffs. -Yeah.

36:11.203 --> 36:13.372
So that would make you my new master perfumer.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.506
[chuckles]

36:14.573 --> 36:17.209
You're going to bottle the scent of love, are you?

36:18.677 --> 36:20.145
What makes you think you can succeed

36:20.178 --> 36:21.713
where every other perfumer in the world

36:21.813 --> 36:22.914
before you has failed?

36:23.682 --> 36:28.186
Well, I'm not sure, but I'm going to give it a try.

36:29.921 --> 36:32.023
I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with.

36:34.493 --> 36:35.861
[Austin] You wanna grab some lunch?

36:35.894 --> 36:38.063
[Shay] So, you're Amy's nephew?

36:38.196 --> 36:38.997
[Austin] Mhm.

36:39.064 --> 36:40.432
All right, is that how you got the job?

36:40.532 --> 36:41.533
No, no, no.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.268
If Aunt Amy had known I'd applied,

36:43.368 --> 36:44.703
I definitely wouldn't of been hired.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.671
Has she always been so intense?

36:46.838 --> 36:48.373
Uh, don't really know.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.077
I mean, my family wasn't close to her growing up.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.680
I think there's a good person underneath that cold demeanor.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.683
But I also see someone who's very lonely.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.887
I guess that's why she's always burying herself in work.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.222
She probably feels like it's safer that way.

37:04.356 --> 37:05.891
No, I think when it comes to love,

37:05.924 --> 37:07.459
she just doesn't really believe in it.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.128
Which is sad, because the way I see it,

37:10.228 --> 37:12.297
if you give up on love, it'll give up on you too.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.732
Flower for the lovers?

37:14.065 --> 37:15.567
[whimsical music]

37:15.734 --> 37:17.269
Sorry- Oh, us?

37:18.103 --> 37:19.538
[chuckling] No we're not lovers.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.373
I mean, we're not even really friends.

37:22.274 --> 37:24.075
I mean, I suppose that we are friends,

37:24.109 --> 37:25.110
just very recent friends,

37:25.210 --> 37:26.244
so it just wouldn't be practical for us

37:26.278 --> 37:27.312
to get each other flowers.

37:29.714 --> 37:31.082
Friends don't get friends flowers.

37:31.550 --> 37:32.717
I mean, I suppose they do,

37:32.751 --> 37:35.253
just friends th-that have been friends

37:35.320 --> 37:37.088
for a lot longer than we have, so...

37:39.491 --> 37:40.959
Just take that.

37:41.960 --> 37:42.794
Thank you.

37:47.065 --> 37:47.899
Sorry.

37:48.633 --> 37:49.501
Sorry.

37:50.168 --> 37:51.670
Read the room, am I right?

37:52.237 --> 37:53.071
Um...

37:53.505 --> 37:54.840
-Why don't we leave this here. -Okay.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.976
As a communal flower to be enjoyed by anyone,

37:58.109 --> 38:00.779
no matter what their friendship slash lover status is.

38:01.112 --> 38:01.847
Great.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.283
So, where should we eat lunch?

38:05.750 --> 38:07.853
Uh, I heard about this local food truck

38:07.953 --> 38:09.120
that does a pop-up restaurant

38:09.154 --> 38:10.455
by the old fountain in the park.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.357
I've been wanting to try it since I moved here.

38:12.457 --> 38:13.158
[bell rings]

38:13.625 --> 38:14.526
Hop in, you two.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.695
Your chariot awaits.

38:17.929 --> 38:18.964
Rick Shaw.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.433
There's no way that's your real name.

38:21.466 --> 38:22.300
Sure is.

38:24.002 --> 38:27.105
[lighthearted music]

38:47.626 --> 38:48.627
Oh my...

38:50.662 --> 38:52.797
So, how does a creative photographer

38:52.831 --> 38:54.165
end up in corporate perfume?

38:54.866 --> 38:56.835
Oof. That's a good question.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.005
Well, um...

39:00.839 --> 39:01.573
I woke up.

39:02.741 --> 39:06.077
Yeah, I woke up like one morning, six months ago.

39:07.412 --> 39:10.415
And I realized that I had spent the past 10 years

39:10.849 --> 39:12.684
doing whatever made people around me happy.

39:12.817 --> 39:13.818
Ah.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.321
Went to the college my brother went to,

39:16.988 --> 39:18.590
got the degree my mom wanted me to get.

39:19.491 --> 39:20.859
I even joined the family business,

39:20.926 --> 39:22.327
because that's when my dad wanted.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.696
They all wanted what was best for me,

39:26.097 --> 39:27.766
but they didn't know what was best for me.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.267
Mhm.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.869
I mean, you're lucky. Your family business

39:30.902 --> 39:32.103
also happens to be your passion.

39:32.203 --> 39:36.374
Oh, well, it's not a family business exactly.

39:37.709 --> 39:41.680
Sort of skipped a generation from my grandmother to me.

39:42.714 --> 39:43.949
My parents never really got it.

39:44.349 --> 39:45.350
I know all about that.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.218
Yeah?

39:48.453 --> 39:50.355
[Austin] You know, for someone who I'm definitely

39:50.388 --> 39:52.223
not in a relationship with... [Shay chuckles]

39:52.390 --> 39:54.125
Thank you for showing me such a lovely time.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.062
Yeah, I had a really nice time too.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.196
[both chuckling]

39:58.263 --> 40:00.932
I- I just had a delivery order canceled last minute.

40:01.433 --> 40:02.267
You guys want it?

40:02.634 --> 40:04.869
It's an ice cream cake, it'd be a shame to let it melt.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.538
Enjoy.

40:06.738 --> 40:07.572
Thanks.

40:09.908 --> 40:10.976
Whoa.

40:11.443 --> 40:14.245
-Come on! What? -[both laughing]

40:15.313 --> 40:17.382
Do you always take photos of aspiring models?

40:17.916 --> 40:18.483
Not exactly.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.085
[both chuckling]

40:20.619 --> 40:23.421
No, I'm uh... I'm working on this long-term project.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.790
It's a self-portrait series.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.927
I take a photo of a different minute of each day,

40:29.260 --> 40:30.829
no matter where I am or what I'm doing.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.498
So, for example, I'm currently at 9:38 A.M.

40:33.598 --> 40:34.766
Okay.

40:34.799 --> 40:37.969
Tomorrow, at exactly that time, I'll take a self-portrait.

40:38.570 --> 40:39.971
Then the next day,

40:40.105 --> 40:42.974
I'll take another at 9:39 A.M., and so on.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.444
Until I've got a photo for every minute in the day.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.013
Wait, so that's...

40:48.613 --> 40:51.416
What- 1,440 photos.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.151
That's a lot of pictures!

40:53.284 --> 40:54.786
Yeah, yeah, it's a big project.

40:55.186 --> 40:58.023
I know it's silly, but I got the idea because

40:58.623 --> 40:59.791
people usually only take photos

40:59.824 --> 41:01.426
of the momentous events in their lives.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.261
But I don't know.

41:03.928 --> 41:07.465
I think really, life is lived in the in between moments.

41:08.333 --> 41:11.036
[wistful music]

41:14.706 --> 41:15.974
[chuckles]

41:16.307 --> 41:19.344
This guy should have a horn on his forehead.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.613
He's a total unicorn!

41:22.547 --> 41:25.183
He made me look even more beautiful than I already am.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.686
Plus, he took you out on a wonderful date.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.654
Hey, it wasn't a date.

41:31.856 --> 41:33.958
It was absolutely wonderful.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.861
I mean, how can two strangers have a day like that?

41:36.995 --> 41:38.363
It doesn't make any sense.

41:39.364 --> 41:40.231
You should've seen it.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.667
Everywhere we turned, romantic things were happening.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.569
It was like a conspiracy.

41:44.669 --> 41:47.172
A conspiracy of love. [chuckles]

41:47.472 --> 41:48.840
I think I've heard of that before.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.175
We can blame Cupid.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.010
You know, that little cherub that wears a diaper

41:52.077 --> 41:53.078
and shoots people with an arrow?

41:53.178 --> 41:54.045
Pew, pew, pew, pew--

41:54.145 --> 41:57.182
Can you be serious for two seconds, please?

42:01.753 --> 42:03.855
I need to figure out what my logical next step should be.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.223
Isn't it obvious?

42:07.692 --> 42:08.526
Yes.

42:09.227 --> 42:10.995
Why do I feel like we are gonna say something

42:11.029 --> 42:12.731
completely different right now?

42:13.698 --> 42:14.432
On three?

42:14.899 --> 42:16.601
One, two, three.

42:16.768 --> 42:17.869
-Take a leap of faith- -Completely deconstruct it-

42:17.936 --> 42:19.904
-And just go with it. -And find a way to stop it.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.107
Why are we even friends?

42:22.707 --> 42:25.443
[whimsical music]

42:42.227 --> 42:46.397
[lighthearted groovy music]

43:01.579 --> 43:02.747
-Hey. -[Shay] Hey.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.616
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me

43:04.716 --> 43:06.084
on such short notice.

43:06.251 --> 43:08.086
I was really happy when you called.

43:09.254 --> 43:10.488
I figured, you're new to town,

43:10.588 --> 43:12.924
so it's my responsibility to show you around.

43:12.991 --> 43:14.926
I thought we did a pretty good job yesterday,

43:15.426 --> 43:16.728
but I'm always up for new adventures.

43:16.761 --> 43:19.297
Well yesterday, we barely scratched the surface,

43:19.397 --> 43:22.834
because today I'm gonna knock your socks off.

43:23.168 --> 43:24.002
Okay.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.070
[Shay chuckles]

43:27.272 --> 43:28.106
Pardon?

43:28.940 --> 43:30.408
-I didn't say anything. -Oh!

43:30.441 --> 43:33.812
You-You're wondering why I'm dressed so sloppily, right?

43:34.179 --> 43:35.780
No, I think you look great.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.652
Uh, well, we just have this tradition here.

43:40.752 --> 43:42.754
It's called "Casual Tuesday"...

43:42.921 --> 43:45.790
[whimsical music]

43:45.857 --> 43:46.758
Some people don't follow it,

43:46.791 --> 43:48.960
but most people take it very seriously.

43:49.961 --> 43:50.795
Cool.

43:51.129 --> 43:53.631
[Shay] Okay, so, uh this is our first stop.

43:54.833 --> 43:57.135
Do you have these in your hometown?

43:57.969 --> 43:58.870
-Libraries? -Yeah.

43:59.504 --> 44:00.839
Yeah, yeah. We sure do.

44:01.673 --> 44:02.974
That's where they keep the uh...

44:03.441 --> 44:05.376
What do you call those things made out of paper

44:05.476 --> 44:06.945
with all the words in them?

44:07.979 --> 44:08.479
Books.

44:08.546 --> 44:09.547
[Austin] Yeah, books.

44:09.814 --> 44:11.316
-[whimsical music] -[Shay] Thank you.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.487
[Shay] I could spend hours in this place.

44:16.554 --> 44:18.056
It really gets my pulse racing.

44:18.389 --> 44:19.724
Flipping through encyclopedias,

44:19.858 --> 44:22.160
reading all the newspapers attached to those sticks.

44:22.293 --> 44:23.127
So thrilling!

44:23.828 --> 44:26.030
Oh, the Dewey Decimal System.

44:26.364 --> 44:28.833
So predictable, so romantic.

44:30.501 --> 44:31.569
Oh, cool!

44:32.470 --> 44:33.671
Cool? What's cool?

44:37.175 --> 44:39.010
This is my favorite photographer.

44:41.646 --> 44:43.248
He's the reason I bought my first camera.

44:44.315 --> 44:47.385
His work is what inspired me to do my own project. I...

44:47.652 --> 44:49.053
I even applied for an internship.

44:49.354 --> 44:50.521
Shh!

44:50.822 --> 44:52.023
Oh, sorry.

44:53.157 --> 44:54.158
Wow.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.262
Hey, thank you so much for bringing me here.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.231
This book is extremely difficult to find.

45:00.365 --> 45:01.599
[Colleen] Shh!

45:03.701 --> 45:05.937
Hey, um. I'll be right back.

45:09.674 --> 45:10.708
[Austin] Excuse me, ma'am?

45:11.542 --> 45:12.577
May I help you with those?

45:12.911 --> 45:14.412
I know most of the alphabet,

45:14.512 --> 45:16.247
so I'm pretty sure I could be of assistance.

45:16.347 --> 45:18.449
[Colleen] You? Sure.

45:19.550 --> 45:20.351
[Austin] I'm Austin, by the way.

45:20.385 --> 45:21.452
[Colleen] Oh, I'm Colleen.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.421
Colleen, you have a splendid library.

45:24.122 --> 45:25.223
Hang on to this one.

45:25.290 --> 45:26.224
He's a keeper.

45:26.457 --> 45:27.392
[Colleen chuckles]

45:28.026 --> 45:30.762
[whimsical music]

45:39.737 --> 45:40.772
[Austin] So, where to next?

45:40.905 --> 45:43.975
Well, are you a fan of the silent arts?

45:44.642 --> 45:45.476
I'll give it a shot.

45:46.044 --> 45:48.813
[whimsical music]

45:53.418 --> 45:54.419
-That's- -It's really boring.

45:54.452 --> 45:55.553
-We should probably go- -No, no no.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.288
Hey, that's incredible.

45:57.422 --> 45:59.223
It's, it's like he's really pulling a rope.

46:00.425 --> 46:02.593
Yeah! Nice!

46:04.262 --> 46:05.296
[Austin chuckles]

46:05.396 --> 46:08.599
-[cell phone rings] -Oh I gotta uh...just take this.

46:09.334 --> 46:10.501
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.103
Okay, uh huh.

46:14.072 --> 46:14.839
Hello.

46:14.939 --> 46:16.941
Hey, how's the love sabotage going?

46:17.075 --> 46:18.109
[Austin] Yeah!

46:18.309 --> 46:19.777
[Austin laughs] Woo!

46:20.511 --> 46:21.145
Terrible.

46:21.245 --> 46:23.414
This guy is like kryptonite.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.316
I mean, I've gotta take it up a notch.

46:26.351 --> 46:28.653
[wondrous music]

46:28.786 --> 46:29.954
Oh, wow.

46:29.988 --> 46:32.023
Well, well, well!

46:32.123 --> 46:34.292
Look who caved in.

46:34.425 --> 46:36.294
And she brought a friend!

46:37.328 --> 46:38.296
You gonna roll?

46:38.463 --> 46:39.630
Mind if I use...

46:39.831 --> 46:40.832
Ragnol?

46:42.133 --> 46:44.702
As long as it's not loaded, Goblin!

46:46.437 --> 46:48.006
How do you have a die on your key chain?

46:48.206 --> 46:49.374
My nephew gave it to me.

46:49.707 --> 46:51.042
-Come on in! -Come on!

46:53.711 --> 46:54.679
I knew you'd come.

46:54.779 --> 46:55.880
Yeah, okay.

46:56.014 --> 46:56.848
-[Austin chuckles] -[Shay] Okay.

46:56.948 --> 46:58.349
I had such an amazing time.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.184
How do you know all the stuff I would love?

47:00.318 --> 47:03.021
I just...uh Googled some things.

47:03.621 --> 47:05.790
Well, since you showed me such a good time today,

47:06.024 --> 47:07.158
can I take you out tomorrow?

47:07.725 --> 47:09.827
There's this amazing botanical greenhouse garden

47:09.894 --> 47:10.962
in the middle of the park.

47:11.062 --> 47:11.896
Do you know it?

47:12.997 --> 47:14.298
Uh, yeah.

47:15.233 --> 47:17.835
That is one of my absolute favorite places.

47:18.703 --> 47:19.537
Perfect.

47:19.837 --> 47:22.507
Let's meet there at exactly 9:39 A.M.

47:22.807 --> 47:23.674
Ugh!

47:24.542 --> 47:27.678
He made the worst places into the best.

47:28.746 --> 47:30.314
I even had fun playing D&D.

47:30.648 --> 47:34.185
I am a seventh level peace domain cleric.

47:34.218 --> 47:37.388
Yeah, I don't know what any of that means, thankfully.

47:37.522 --> 47:39.524
Mm. It's powerful.

47:39.857 --> 47:40.691
A game breaker.

47:41.159 --> 47:42.026
Now I know that.

47:42.160 --> 47:44.228
I mean, there's knowledge I now have.

47:44.362 --> 47:46.064
What am I gonna do about this?

47:46.164 --> 47:48.533
Okay, you're not powerless here.

47:48.733 --> 47:50.868
If you really believe that his feelings aren't real

47:51.002 --> 47:52.203
and he's under some spell,

47:52.336 --> 47:54.705
then just tell him you don't wanna see him anymore.

47:55.273 --> 47:58.042
But I...I do wanna see him.

47:58.743 --> 48:00.511
That's the problem!

48:00.578 --> 48:02.680
Well, maybe you're under a spell then too.

48:03.114 --> 48:05.583
[tense music]

48:07.218 --> 48:08.052
No, I'm not.

48:08.586 --> 48:09.420
I just...

48:12.056 --> 48:14.225
I just want something that's real, okay?

48:17.562 --> 48:18.563
What's his name?

48:19.464 --> 48:20.965
The guy you're talking about right now?

48:21.065 --> 48:21.899
Austin.

48:23.434 --> 48:24.802
You know that. What are you doing?

48:24.969 --> 48:27.538
I'm just making sure you're not confusing him with Brad,

48:27.605 --> 48:29.107
because they're different people, you know.

48:29.207 --> 48:30.141
Yes, I know that.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.075
Do you?

48:31.242 --> 48:32.243
'Cause the way that you're talking,

48:32.276 --> 48:33.945
it sounds like Austin's the one that dumped you

48:34.045 --> 48:35.279
when you were at your lowest point.

48:35.379 --> 48:36.380
Because last time I checked...

48:36.414 --> 48:37.882
Let me, let me check.

48:38.082 --> 48:39.317
Oh yeah, that was Brad.

48:40.818 --> 48:41.786
This isn't about Brad.

48:41.919 --> 48:42.987
Okay. Okay.

48:43.254 --> 48:44.989
-I'm just checking. -[whimsical music]

48:48.626 --> 48:52.430
[lighthearted music]

48:57.568 --> 48:58.603
Hey, perfect.

48:58.736 --> 48:59.937
[Austin] You're right on time.

49:01.606 --> 49:02.673
Hey, listen, Austin.

49:02.807 --> 49:04.942
There's something that I need to talk to you--

49:04.976 --> 49:06.777
Do you mind if we take this photo first?

49:07.311 --> 49:08.279
Uh, sure.

49:11.983 --> 49:14.118
So, this is your spot right here.

49:15.153 --> 49:16.120
Okay. [chuckles]

49:17.455 --> 49:18.289
Okay.

49:18.623 --> 49:19.457
Wait--

49:19.490 --> 49:22.927
In three, two, one.

49:23.194 --> 49:24.095
[camera shutter snaps]

49:24.262 --> 49:27.298
Hang on. This is for your self-portrait project.

49:27.465 --> 49:28.666
I shouldn't even be in this photo.

49:28.766 --> 49:29.600
Of course you should.

49:29.934 --> 49:31.502
It's a project about moments in my life,

49:31.969 --> 49:36.507
and in this moment, for the past couple days now in fact,

49:37.808 --> 49:39.210
I've been thinking a lot about you.

49:41.546 --> 49:44.048
Uh so, what did you want to talk to me about?

49:45.983 --> 49:48.686
Oh [stutters] it's just that the love potion...

49:48.819 --> 49:52.056
The love uh-perfume is coming along great.

49:52.823 --> 49:53.658
Great.

49:54.392 --> 49:56.827
Now, magic is about to happen.

49:59.163 --> 50:05.503
[calming heartfelt music]

50:21.586 --> 50:23.588
I'm honored to be on the rope of fame.

50:23.888 --> 50:25.156
We'll always have that moment.

50:28.392 --> 50:33.030
You know, I'm realizing that what you do and what I do,

50:34.065 --> 50:34.932
we're not that different.

50:35.032 --> 50:36.067
Mm.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.536
Do you know that smell is the strongest sense memory?

50:40.571 --> 50:44.041
One scent can bring you back to this

50:44.075 --> 50:45.876
nostalgic moment in your life.

50:48.546 --> 50:49.714
Just like a photograph.

50:51.215 --> 50:52.950
I completely agree.

50:54.252 --> 50:57.355
[lighthearted music]

50:58.456 --> 50:59.290
Oh, no.

51:00.524 --> 51:01.425
What time is it?

51:01.892 --> 51:02.860
Ah!

51:03.394 --> 51:05.763
[tense music]

51:06.731 --> 51:07.598
You're late.

51:08.065 --> 51:08.899
Yeah.

51:09.033 --> 51:10.234
It's okay, it's okay.

51:10.868 --> 51:12.069
This is my hubby, Chad.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.571
[Chad] This better not take long.

51:13.738 --> 51:15.239
And what's up with the storage locker?

51:15.539 --> 51:16.140
You the manager?

51:16.240 --> 51:16.874
Chad!

51:16.907 --> 51:17.808
No.

51:18.542 --> 51:19.377
Shall we go inside?

51:19.610 --> 51:20.444
Come on in!

51:23.547 --> 51:26.984
Okay, well, thank you for sharing all that.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.619
I've got everything I need.

51:28.819 --> 51:29.654
Good.

51:30.154 --> 51:31.822
'Cause I'm not coming back for no cologne.

51:31.989 --> 51:33.057
Oh, no, you won't have to.

51:33.824 --> 51:35.660
Just need a few more moments of your patience.

51:39.664 --> 51:40.598
I'm sorry!

51:40.965 --> 51:41.799
It's...

51:44.969 --> 51:45.803
Okay.

51:47.271 --> 51:49.974
[lighthearted music]

51:51.142 --> 51:53.110
[Shay sniffs]

51:56.414 --> 51:57.315
[Shay] This is for you.

51:58.115 --> 52:00.584
[tense music]

52:01.018 --> 52:03.287
[Chad sniffs]

52:03.988 --> 52:07.291
-[wondrous music] -[exhales]

52:16.133 --> 52:17.034
You got me.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.137
Right in my heart part.

52:21.472 --> 52:22.940
How did you manage to make a fragrance like that

52:22.973 --> 52:23.974
for him on the spot?

52:24.842 --> 52:27.778
Oh, some men are simpler.

52:28.112 --> 52:30.614
I can't thank you enough for all you've done.

52:31.315 --> 52:32.983
Oh! Okay.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.186
-You're welcome. -Oh, okay.

52:37.288 --> 52:38.489
-Thank you. Really. -Thank you.

52:38.689 --> 52:39.957
-Thank you so much. -Thank you!

52:44.895 --> 52:46.697
That was amazing.

52:46.831 --> 52:47.832
[Shay chuckles]

52:47.898 --> 52:48.999
How did you do that?

52:50.534 --> 52:51.902
I can show you, if you want.

52:52.503 --> 52:53.671
[cell phone buzzes]

52:53.838 --> 52:54.672
Oh.

52:55.873 --> 52:57.341
-[sighs] It's my aunt. -Oh.

52:57.375 --> 52:58.209
Better take it.

52:59.143 --> 52:59.977
Hello?

53:00.845 --> 53:01.645
Hey!

53:03.080 --> 53:04.248
Oof, ow.

53:04.915 --> 53:06.917
Okay, before you say anything, I'm gonna get you the rent.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.719
Oh, hey. No, no, no, no stress.

53:08.886 --> 53:11.856
You know, you are in the D&D club now, right?

53:12.723 --> 53:14.091
So it's a different set of rules.

53:14.191 --> 53:17.027
Also, Austin can do no wrong in my book.

53:17.194 --> 53:18.195
That guy is awesome.

53:18.696 --> 53:20.564
-Yeah, he's pretty great, right? -Yeah.

53:22.867 --> 53:24.902
You have him under a spell, don't you?

53:25.369 --> 53:27.004
[tense music]

53:27.037 --> 53:27.938
What did you say?

53:28.038 --> 53:30.674
Hello? I'm a dungeon master.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.244
I know when somebody is under a spell when I see it.

53:33.344 --> 53:37.681
And that guy is in dagger, battleax, and long sword.

53:39.216 --> 53:41.719
Okay, so I can't believe I'm gonna ask you this,

53:41.786 --> 53:44.422
but in D&D...

53:44.522 --> 53:45.356
Yes?

53:45.489 --> 53:47.525
How would you figure out if a character is...

53:47.591 --> 53:49.093
under a spell or not?

53:50.227 --> 53:52.062
Well, I mean, you would just do the exact opposite

53:52.096 --> 53:54.765
of what you think the spell is, right? So if it was an ice spell

53:54.899 --> 53:56.767
then you would retaliate with a bonfire spell.

53:56.901 --> 53:59.570
And if it immediately reverses the effects,

53:59.737 --> 54:00.771
then you know it's magic.

54:00.905 --> 54:03.707
So, if it was a sweet smelling spell,

54:03.774 --> 54:07.044
then a stinking spell should neutralize it.

54:08.646 --> 54:11.549
You grew up so fast, Groncaca Pixador.

54:11.982 --> 54:13.451
God, I wish I could pick my own name.

54:13.651 --> 54:14.485
You know, one day,

54:14.819 --> 54:18.622
you are going to be a dungeon master, just like me.

54:18.956 --> 54:22.259
[lighthearted music]

54:22.560 --> 54:24.762
Our spring launch is just a few days away,

54:24.795 --> 54:27.097
and I need to include a fragrance in it.

54:27.798 --> 54:29.500
Is your girl going to be able to pull it off?

54:30.100 --> 54:31.435
Is she real or not?

54:32.269 --> 54:33.103
Oh, she's real.

54:34.572 --> 54:35.272
I hope so.

54:35.773 --> 54:38.242
[tense music]

54:40.110 --> 54:40.945
After you.

54:42.847 --> 54:43.781
Oh, wow.

54:44.081 --> 54:47.084
[lighthearted music]

54:50.688 --> 54:51.522
Wow.

54:51.922 --> 54:52.823
This is something else.

54:52.990 --> 54:54.258
Ah, a little messy.

54:54.425 --> 54:55.259
Are you serious?

54:55.993 --> 54:56.994
You should see my place.

55:01.932 --> 55:03.767
Oh, that's the organ.

55:04.635 --> 55:06.003
What people in the industry call it.

55:06.103 --> 55:06.937
It's...

55:07.438 --> 55:09.306
Really just a fancy desk.

55:09.940 --> 55:11.175
[Austin] Where did you get all these?

55:11.275 --> 55:13.210
[Shay] I've been collecting them most of my life.

55:13.944 --> 55:14.979
Collecting memories?

55:16.013 --> 55:17.314
Why don't I show you?

55:17.448 --> 55:18.682
Here, have a seat. Um...

55:20.184 --> 55:21.719
And uh...

55:23.320 --> 55:24.655
Here uh...

55:24.989 --> 55:29.026
Now, I just need something to blindfold you with.

55:29.159 --> 55:29.994
Here.

55:31.695 --> 55:32.997
[Austin] I always have a tie on hand,

55:33.030 --> 55:34.498
in case I get called into the office.

55:34.832 --> 55:35.666
Mm.

55:37.568 --> 55:38.836
-Ready? -Of course.

55:42.339 --> 55:45.509
[calming piano music]

55:48.145 --> 55:49.413
Okay. Um...

55:51.982 --> 55:55.085
[calming piano music]

55:57.721 --> 56:00.190
[Shay] What do you smell?

56:00.824 --> 56:01.859
[sniffs]

56:02.526 --> 56:03.694
Smells like strawberries.

56:04.361 --> 56:05.195
Okay.

56:05.529 --> 56:06.530
And what do you feel?

56:07.197 --> 56:10.334
What's that specific memory that comes to mind?

56:11.335 --> 56:13.571
When I was a kid, we went strawberry picking.

56:14.204 --> 56:15.039
It was a hot summer day,

56:15.105 --> 56:16.707
and the whole field smelled like that.

56:17.541 --> 56:18.509
Wow.

56:18.776 --> 56:19.944
That is incredible. I...

56:20.110 --> 56:21.946
[laughs] Okay.

56:22.880 --> 56:23.948
Excuse me, no peeking.

56:24.048 --> 56:26.050
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

56:30.120 --> 56:31.555
[Shay] Okay, um...

56:32.389 --> 56:34.558
Ooh, this is a good one.

56:35.926 --> 56:36.927
How about this?

56:37.428 --> 56:38.762
[Austin sniffs]

56:39.096 --> 56:40.531
Summerland Fair.

56:41.699 --> 56:43.567
1995.

56:45.302 --> 56:46.637
That was my first job.

56:46.904 --> 56:48.305
W-what is that?

56:48.739 --> 56:49.974
It's an organic compound

56:50.074 --> 56:53.077
that smells distinctly of...

56:53.444 --> 56:54.778
-cotton candy. -[Austin chuckles]

56:54.878 --> 56:56.714
You're right, cotton candy. That's it.

56:59.483 --> 57:00.384
Okay.

57:01.085 --> 57:01.952
Next.

57:02.252 --> 57:03.754
[calming piano music]

57:03.921 --> 57:05.789
[sniffs]

57:06.924 --> 57:07.758
Oh.

57:09.760 --> 57:10.394
It's jasmine.

57:10.427 --> 57:11.829
Oh, you don't like it?

57:12.096 --> 57:12.930
No, it's...

57:13.831 --> 57:15.399
Kinda reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.

57:16.233 --> 57:17.101
Jules.

57:17.267 --> 57:19.470
-I'm sorry. -No, it's uh... it's fine.

57:19.937 --> 57:20.838
It was a long time ago.

57:22.172 --> 57:24.308
It's just that whenever I smell jasmine,

57:24.408 --> 57:26.610
it brings back a lot of crappy memories.

57:28.579 --> 57:29.613
Mine's called Brad.

57:30.748 --> 57:33.851
Every time I smell sandalwood, I think about him.

57:34.518 --> 57:35.619
Do you know what the number one ingredient

57:35.686 --> 57:36.620
in men's cologne is?

57:36.687 --> 57:38.422
I'll take sandalwood for a thousand, please.

57:38.455 --> 57:40.124
[Shay chuckles] Yeah.

57:41.825 --> 57:43.661
So, what's your favorite fragrance?

57:45.162 --> 57:46.664
It's an oldie.

57:48.298 --> 57:49.299
It's classic.

57:50.300 --> 57:53.470
[calming piano music]

57:55.139 --> 57:57.207
Now, the scent is very delicate,

57:57.307 --> 57:58.342
so you have to get nice and close

57:58.442 --> 57:59.677
so you can fully appreciate it.

58:00.844 --> 58:02.513
[both sniffing]

58:03.013 --> 58:03.847
It's vanilla.

58:08.152 --> 58:09.987
They say it's the most sensual fragrance.

58:10.988 --> 58:13.624
[calming music]

58:15.325 --> 58:16.660
Hey, Shay um...

58:17.394 --> 58:18.562
I need to tell you something.

58:19.663 --> 58:23.167
Ever since we've met, I've felt so...different.

58:25.135 --> 58:26.170
Different?

58:26.336 --> 58:28.906
Yeah, it's like I'm not in control or something.

58:29.506 --> 58:31.809
I-I know this is gonna sound crazy,

58:31.909 --> 58:33.477
but it feels like I'm under some kind of--

58:33.510 --> 58:34.411
Spell.

58:35.412 --> 58:38.315
Yeah, but in a good way.

58:41.518 --> 58:42.920
Could you excuse me for a moment?

58:53.897 --> 58:55.032
Okay, dungeon master.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.034
Don't let me down.

58:57.868 --> 59:01.038
[playful music]

59:01.205 --> 59:04.341
-[bottle sprays] -[Shay coughs]

59:11.415 --> 59:12.249
Oof.

59:17.721 --> 59:19.056
Ah...

59:19.723 --> 59:22.559
[tense music]

59:25.562 --> 59:27.297
[objects clanging]

59:31.235 --> 59:32.870
-[Shay] Uh, hey. -Hey.

59:34.238 --> 59:34.938
Everything okay?

59:35.038 --> 59:36.106
Yeah.

59:36.273 --> 59:37.441
Listen, I hope I didn't make things weird

59:37.541 --> 59:38.742
by saying all that stuff.

59:39.209 --> 59:41.278
The last thing I want to do is to come on too strong.

59:41.378 --> 59:45.883
No, no, no, it's-it's fine.

59:49.486 --> 59:51.255
Speaking of coming on too strong, see,

59:51.288 --> 59:54.758
the funny thing about scents is that some of them are good,

59:54.792 --> 59:57.127
but some are... bad.

59:57.294 --> 59:59.296
Just so bad.

01:00:00.731 --> 01:00:02.132
Bad, bad, bad, bad.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:03.934
Bad.

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:06.436
Unlike pizza.

01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:09.106
Bad pizza, always good. Bad scents are just...

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:12.442
Bad.

01:00:13.577 --> 01:00:16.146
-That's deep. -Mm.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.582
Hey, so, speaking of pizza,

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:19.850
do you wanna go grab a slice

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.351
at that new place around the corner?

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:24.922
Sure.

01:00:25.022 --> 01:00:25.856
Great.

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:33.197
[Shay gags]

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:37.501
You know, my grandmother once made this fragrance

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.002
for a woman with dementia.

01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:41.271
All of her memories had been lost,

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:45.108
but when she smelled that perfume,

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.978
her eyes just like lit up with joy, and...

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:49.980
all the things she'd lost

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:51.615
came flooding back to her.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:54.985
That's what I can do at the store.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.454
I can make people happy.

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:01.325
I just don't know if I'll ever be able to get it back again.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.360
So, where was your store?

01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:06.196
[Shay chuckles]

01:01:06.363 --> 01:01:07.497
You're gonna laugh.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:08.498
What?

01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:12.236
Scentuarium by Amy.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.238
Oh, man.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.906
-The exact location? -Mhm.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.175
Oh, no. What are the odds?

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:19.176
[Shay] Yeah.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.477
Hey, wait a second. Are-

01:01:20.711 --> 01:01:23.046
Are you telling me that my aunt is responsible

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.982
for your family's store going out of business?

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.149
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.018
Your aunt had nothing to do with it.

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.653
The bankruptcy was my fault.

01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:31.722
I'm just trying to do something

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:33.924
the world clearly doesn't want anymore.

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:34.892
Still.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:36.193
Still, I'm sorry.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.428
I-I shouldn't have had us meet there.

01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:39.897
No, no, no, it's okay.

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:41.031
You didn't know.

01:01:43.267 --> 01:01:46.570
So um, let me get this straight. Um...

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.873
You design perfumes for all these other people

01:01:50.007 --> 01:01:51.041
to make them happy.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:53.543
What about you?

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:56.346
Do you deserve happiness?

01:01:57.347 --> 01:01:59.283
[calming piano music]

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.218
I hope so.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.054
[Shay] Screw it, okay?

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.056
I'm in.

01:02:06.123 --> 01:02:08.558
I am powerless against the love potion,

01:02:08.592 --> 01:02:09.760
even if it isn't real.

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:12.362
And even if I wanted to fix it, I can't.

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:17.901
So I'm just gonna go with my heart over my head for once.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:23.206
Stop trying to understand logic, and just believe.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.609
I am so happy for you.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.244
You really deserve this, Shay.

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:30.047
Also, I'm gonna stop trying to figure out

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:31.581
the relic perfume recipe.

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:32.616
If I was meant to figure it out,

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:33.750
I would've done it by now, right?

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:34.718
Are you sure?

01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:36.253
You spent a lot of time on that.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.154
Exactly.

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:40.557
I'm going with my heart from now on.

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:41.658
Hm.

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:43.827
Hey, look, I'll call you in the morning, okay?

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:46.163
Bye.

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:55.072
[lighthearted music]

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.495
[laptop beeps]

01:03:19.663 --> 01:03:22.966
[calming piano music]

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:30.207
[cell phone buzzes]

01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:33.710
Hello?

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:36.146
Yeah, speaking?

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:41.852
[lighthearted piano music]

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.302
[knocking]

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:02.672
I got your message.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.474
[Darian] Delete that email.

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:06.343
I can't.

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:10.047
Now that I know the recipe,

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.149
I have to do the right thing.

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:19.189
I spent so much time trying to figure out

01:04:19.256 --> 01:04:21.925
this ancient perfume recipe,

01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:26.029
and then I do it completely by accident

01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:27.364
without even realizing it.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:30.200
I mean, I must've had to mix those ingredients

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:34.504
in the exact order, with the precise measurements.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:36.873
I mean, do you know what the chances of that are?

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.909
And then, this is my favorite part...

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:41.678
It just happens to be a love potion?!

01:04:41.912 --> 01:04:43.713
And then I go and I spill it on the guy,

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.948
who under any other circumstances,

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:47.584
is the most perfect person in the world for me.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:52.022
I mean, I must be the unluckiest human on the planet.

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:53.356
Wow.

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:55.392
Am I invited?

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.395
What ar-what are you talking about? Invited where?

01:04:58.462 --> 01:05:01.064
To the pity party you're throwing yourself right now.

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:03.366
[Darian] Shay! You can decide

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.969
to be the luckiest or the unluckiest person,

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:08.238
it just depends upon your perspective.

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:12.209
And from mine, I don't think I've ever seen you so happy.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:14.444
Besides, you don't even know what happened for sure

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:16.046
when all that stuff got knocked around.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.147
Of course I do.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.584
This is the only logical explanation

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.952
for any of this.

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:22.919
[Darian] Is it?

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:24.821
-Because I have another theory. -Hit me.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.156
You're scared.

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:30.627
[Darian] You're scared to fall in love,

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:33.396
so you're looking for any excuse to tell yourself

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.798
that it's not real.

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:37.334
Telling yourself to believe in magic?

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.102
Which, by the way, I do.

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:40.670
I don't believe in potions,

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.106
but I believe in the magic of love.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:45.775
And you have the ability to create it,

01:05:46.176 --> 01:05:48.578
and you have the ability to take it away.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:51.648
So you need to decide which one of those options you want.

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:57.621
I've gotta find a way to know for sure.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:05:59.489
[Ken] That's your problem, you-

01:05:59.589 --> 01:06:00.924
[Wilma] Oh, for Pete's sake!

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:05.262
I am so tired of you complaining about every little thing.

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:06.496
[Ken] It's not every little thing.

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:08.865
It's your whole family, that's what I'm complaining about.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.600
[Wilma] There we go, it's my family.

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:12.369
[Ken] Well, it's all your family's fault.

01:06:12.769 --> 01:06:14.871
[Wilma and Ken continue arguing]

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:17.641
I do know how to figure it out.

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:21.678
I will just recreate the ancient love perfume.

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:23.813
I mean, I-I have the recipe now, right?

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:26.216
Okay, and that'll be my base.

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.118
And then I'll combine all the other ingredients,

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:30.153
I'll do the smell test to be absolutely certain

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.822
it's the exact combination I spilled on Austin at the party.

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:35.792
That'll be experiment A.

01:06:36.793 --> 01:06:38.828
And then- and then for experiment B,

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:42.032
I'll find someone else to test it on.

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:43.700
I am not a lab rat.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.468
No, [whispers] Wilma!

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.004
I'm gonna test it on Wilma.

01:06:49.906 --> 01:06:52.008
And then we'll figure out if A plus B equals C.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.544
Please stop with the scientific jargon.

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:56.246
It is not jargon, it's the alphabet!

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:57.981
It's confusing me!

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:00.850
If it works on those two,

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:02.886
then it definitely has magical powers.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:04.154
Are they not in love?

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:05.155
No.

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:06.523
From the sounds of their arguing,

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:08.391
they fell outta love a long time ago.

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.727
[Wilma] You'd like to just like rent another place.

01:07:10.827 --> 01:07:12.028
[Ken] Oh!

01:07:12.095 --> 01:07:13.363
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.332
-[tense music] -[continue arguing]

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:16.266
[knocking]

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.203
-I wanted to give you this. -Aww.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:22.172
Today's your anniversary, right?

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:23.673
More like ad-versary.

01:07:24.007 --> 01:07:25.208
Hi, Ken.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.377
Well, maybe I can blind myself with this

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.412
so I don't have to look at his mug again.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:32.582
I'm sorry. It's beautiful, thank you.

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:33.516
You're welcome.

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:47.864
-[tense music] -[clock ticks]

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.582
[romantic jazz music]

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:12.922
Oh, Shay!

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:13.957
Hi!

01:08:14.057 --> 01:08:14.991
What are you doing here?

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:15.892
Uh...

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.228
I thought this was my apartment.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.765
Turns out it's not just the mail carrier who gets confused.

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.333
I don't want to crack the creme brulee

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:24.301
without you, darling.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:25.268
Oh!

01:08:26.136 --> 01:08:28.571
We are having such a romantic evening,

01:08:28.972 --> 01:08:30.573
just like when we were first married.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.144
Oh, and thank you for that thoughtful perfume.

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:36.346
I'm wearing it now.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.314
[Wilma chuckles]

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.015
Goodnight.

01:08:39.516 --> 01:08:41.117
[door slams]

01:08:41.351 --> 01:08:44.120
[dramatic music]

01:08:56.099 --> 01:08:57.967
Somehow I knew I'd find you here.

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:02.172
I knew it was too perfect to be true.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:05.675
I'm just not meant to find love.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:06.976
You don't know that.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:08.178
Yes, I do.

01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:10.480
And now that I know that,

01:09:10.547 --> 01:09:12.982
I have a responsibility to break this

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:14.951
stupid love potion curse,

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:16.786
and just let Austin be free to love

01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.154
whoever he's meant to be with.

01:09:19.155 --> 01:09:19.989
What about Amy?

01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:22.625
I'll whip something up for her.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.462
The world doesn't want individuality,

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:27.630
so I'm just gonna give them what they want.

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:29.833
Generic.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.001
Why don't you just give her the relic potion?

01:09:32.035 --> 01:09:33.203
It'll be a huge hit.

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:35.572
It would be way too dangerous to release a love potion

01:09:35.672 --> 01:09:36.506
into the world.

01:09:36.806 --> 01:09:38.341
Because people will fall in love?

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:40.543
There'd be a love apocalypse?

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:42.212
Shay, look around.

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:43.980
The world could use that right now.

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.683
People should fall in love of their own free will,

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:48.852
not the effects of some potion.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.859
[calming music]

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.027
Hey.

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.564
I left you a couple of messages yesterday.

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:05.502
Yeah um, I got a little tied up.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:07.203
Everything all right?

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.039
No.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:13.009
Austin, I really need to talk to you.

01:10:13.576 --> 01:10:17.113
Um, yeah. But can we take this photo first?

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.381
No, this can't wait.

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:19.849
Look...

01:10:22.085 --> 01:10:23.787
I can't see you anymore.

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:25.722
And I'm not even gonna try to explain,

01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:27.357
because it's not gonna make any sense.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.562
I just really need you to know that...

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:35.265
That even though this wasn't real,

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:39.769
this is the best experience that I've ever had with anyone.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:43.773
You've really shown me what we should all be searching for

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:45.074
when we're looking for love.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:47.811
Shay, my feelings for you are real.

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:50.580
Hey, listen to me.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.416
I fell in love with you the very first time

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:54.818
I laid eyes on you.

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:57.620
It was just an illusion.

01:10:58.388 --> 01:10:59.422
Yes, it was.

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:00.757
It was from what happened the first time

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.091
we met at Amy's house.

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.296
I'm so sorry, it's all my fault.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:07.964
-No. -[somber music]

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:11.167
And I just need you to know

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.403
that I'm not doing this to hurt you.

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:14.737
Okay?

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:17.941
I'm doing it out of love.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:22.612
[light dramatic music]

01:11:31.421 --> 01:11:32.255
Shay!

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:37.627
[somber music]

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:52.609
Is this love?

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:55.311
No.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:58.448
How could I possibly design a fragrance

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.450
for something I've never experienced?

01:12:02.552 --> 01:12:03.486
[sniffs]

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.721
I'm sorry I failed too.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:06.289
You didn't fail.

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:08.024
This is very good.

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:11.494
You had a tough time with this, didn't you?

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:15.532
It's because love doesn't exist.

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:17.367
It's just a made up story

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.736
we tell ourselves to feel better about life.

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:21.838
[dramatic music]

01:12:21.905 --> 01:12:22.972
That's cynical.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:26.009
The cynic is just a realist after a very bad day.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.044
You've never been in love?

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:29.879
Well...

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.516
I thought I was in love once.

01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:36.853
When I was 17, I spent the summer

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.721
in the south of France on a vineyard.

01:12:39.656 --> 01:12:42.025
Everything was so new and delicious.

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:46.095
The food, the language, the culture.

01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:50.400
The boy.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.037
I have this vivid memory of the two of us

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:57.006
running through a beautiful meadow of wildflowers.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:00.710
[Amy] Laughing, reaching out to touch every flower.

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:03.212
I felt so alive. So sure

01:13:03.346 --> 01:13:06.182
I would always be carefree with that beautiful boy...

01:13:11.087 --> 01:13:14.457
But that turned out to be just another fairytale.

01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:16.359
Not real.

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:17.594
Not by a long shot.

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.899
I'm sorry it didn't work out for you and Austin,

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:24.901
but he's gone now.

01:13:27.036 --> 01:13:28.071
Gone?

01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:32.308
[Amy] Some internship with a photographer named Bjorn.

01:13:33.543 --> 01:13:34.577
I don't quite get it.

01:13:35.378 --> 01:13:38.581
He said he still loves you, despite the heartbreak.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:42.285
All matters of the heart just get messy,

01:13:42.385 --> 01:13:44.554
that's why I stay away.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:48.791
Everything's in here.

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:51.260
The recipe, everything you need.

01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:53.763
[Shay] Um, I don't want any money for it.

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:56.165
I'm out of the perfume business.

01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:58.568
Well, at least you should come for the launch party.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:13:59.769
I'll send a car to get you.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:02.438
No, thank you. I'm not going.

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:06.476
[knocking]

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.749
Hi, sorry to bother you.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:14.617
We were just kinda worried about you.

01:14:14.684 --> 01:14:15.618
Are you okay?

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:17.320
I have a confession.

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:20.189
I used to love potion on you.

01:14:20.356 --> 01:14:21.858
A love potion?

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.793
Yeah, the perfume that I gave you.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.429
That's why you had such a nice time on your anniversary.

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:28.498
[Wilma laughs]

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:30.633
Well, you think we had a nice anniversary

01:14:30.767 --> 01:14:31.801
because of a perfume?

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:32.969
[Ken chuckles]

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:35.204
You know, we've been married for 50 years.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:39.509
Perfume is nice, but marriages have their ups and downs,

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:41.477
and that's what makes them work so well.

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:44.113
There's no such thing as a love potion.

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:48.017
Things can help, but the only thing that makes it work

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:50.687
i-is trust, loyalty, commitment.

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:52.822
And you know, not watching loud sports all day

01:14:52.955 --> 01:14:53.956
and hogging the remote.

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.892
Or interrupting while other people are talking.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:56.993
[Wilma chuckles]

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.730
Anyway, no potion can make love happen or take it away.

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:02.899
That's up to us.

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:06.169
We just have to recognize it when it's happening,

01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:08.337
and be smart enough to hold onto it.

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:09.839
Or dumb enough.

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:12.141
-Oh, stop it. -[Wilma laughs]

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:14.877
Anyway, just one piece of mail today.

01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:16.646
There you go.

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:17.980
So you okay?

01:15:18.081 --> 01:15:18.881
-Mhm. -[Wilma] Okay, good.

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:19.849
Night, night, night.

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:20.817
Night.

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:29.392
[melancholic music]

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:43.206
[Austin's voice] "Shay.

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:45.875
This is from the very first time I ever saw you.

01:15:46.442 --> 01:15:49.045
And it's this moment I fell in love with you.

01:15:49.579 --> 01:15:51.914
You can try to say my feelings for you weren't real,

01:15:52.682 --> 01:15:54.250
but I know in my heart that they are,

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:56.252
and I'll never forget that.

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:59.355
Much love, Austin."

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.894
The first time that he saw me.

01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:15.404
[melancholic music]

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:20.810
[Shay] Methyl dihydrojasmonate.

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:22.545
Jasmine.

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:27.049
[sobs]

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:38.394
I know you're probably expecting your one true love,

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.296
because that's what's supposed to happen

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.464
in moments like this,

01:16:41.564 --> 01:16:43.966
but it's just me.

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.601
[lighthearted music]

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:46.736
Go get ready.

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:48.437
You need to come with me, let's go.

01:16:49.505 --> 01:16:50.573
Where are we going?

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:53.609
Use your scientific mind and take a guess.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.578
-Darian! -No, no.

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:57.246
No protests from you.

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.115
Hair, makeup, dress.

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:00.149
Let's go.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.953
And you are most certainly wearing heels tonight.

[lighthearted string music]

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:26.976
There's nobody here yet.

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:27.977
What's the rush?

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.512
I wanted you to see something.

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:34.550
[tense music]

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:39.488
Looks like I'm not the only one

01:17:39.555 --> 01:17:41.858
with a big modeling career in my future.

01:17:45.795 --> 01:17:46.863
Go take a closer look.

01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:50.700
[romantic music]

01:18:04.714 --> 01:18:05.815
[Austin] What do you think?

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:10.553
-Whoa! -Whoa!

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:14.023
I was hoping to knock you off your feet, but not literally.

01:18:14.824 --> 01:18:15.858
I thought you were gone.

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.594
Oh, Shay, I would never have missed your launch.

01:18:19.929 --> 01:18:22.365
I just wanted to give you some space

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.200
out of respect for your decision.

01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:27.837
Listen, if you don't feel the way that I do,

01:18:27.904 --> 01:18:28.771
then I understand.

01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:29.739
No, no, no. I-I

01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:31.741
I do feel the same way that you do.

01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:34.710
[calming music]

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:37.380
I thought I used a love potion on you.

01:18:38.281 --> 01:18:39.215
Which time?

01:18:39.282 --> 01:18:41.550
Well, the first time was an accident, but...

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.888
the second time was on purpose.

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:48.557
I thought I was doing the right thing,

01:18:48.624 --> 01:18:50.593
because I thought I was using an antidote on you,

01:18:50.693 --> 01:18:52.428
but then I realized that it had jasmine in it.

01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:54.597
and you probably thought that I was trying to hurt you.

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:56.365
I didn't know what to think, to be honest.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:57.233
It's just...

01:18:58.134 --> 01:18:58.901
You know, for the record,

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:00.403
I don't hate the smell of jasmine.

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:02.605
It's just that dose was pretty potent.

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:05.074
You're right.

01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:08.044
I thought you were trying to send me a message.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.479
I'm so sorry.

01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:15.618
I was trying to break a love spell.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.955
So you believe in love potions now?

01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:24.060
Well, I didn't, but all the signs were there and...

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:27.330
I guess I believe that...

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:33.269
Love is a pretty powerful thing,

01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:35.972
and you can't give up on it.

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:38.741
Because then it'll give up on you too.

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:41.777
I apologize for intruding on your moment.

01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:43.446
That was inspiring.

01:19:43.813 --> 01:19:45.348
You made me realize something.

01:19:45.648 --> 01:19:47.616
That love does exist?

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:48.684
[Amy] No, no, no...

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:51.620
Something about this scent has been nagging at me.

01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:53.956
It's a very pretty fragrance, yes.

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:56.292
But you're right, it's not love.

01:19:56.759 --> 01:19:58.327
We need to pull the fragrance from the launch.

01:19:58.427 --> 01:19:59.662
No, no, no, you can't pull the launch.

01:19:59.762 --> 01:20:01.030
The party starts in less than an hour.

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.031
[Amy] I can do anything I want.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:03.265
I'm the CEO.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.301
The perfume is generic.

01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:06.435
I just don't feel it.

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:07.870
No, of course you don't.

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:09.772
Because it wasn't made for you.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.607
Well then, for whom was it made?

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:15.845
Everyone in general, and... and no one in particular.

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:17.880
I don't follow. Explain.

01:20:18.848 --> 01:20:19.682
I can't.

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:21.550
Just give me an hour.

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:24.186
-Keep her busy. -Okay.

01:20:24.954 --> 01:20:28.557
[tense whimsical music]

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:45.007
[dramatic inspiring music]

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:04.226
[upbeat dance music]

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.198
She's here.

01:21:12.435 --> 01:21:13.335
[Shay] Here.

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:14.437
Just try it.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.706
-I don't have time for this. -Please.

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:20.176
I promise you won't be disappointed.

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:25.915
[tense hopeful music]

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:36.292
[wondrous music]

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:42.298
How...

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:44.767
You told me about France, and the meadow,

01:21:44.867 --> 01:21:45.901
and the flowers,

01:21:46.035 --> 01:21:48.237
and normally that would make an incredible scent, but...

01:21:49.605 --> 01:21:54.310
but it took me going through a heartache just like you did,

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:56.612
to fully understand that what you need from love

01:21:56.712 --> 01:21:58.481
is completely different from anyone else.

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.420
This is it. This is the scent.

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:05.921
No, it isn't.

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.424
This is yours.

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:11.260
But it's only yours.

01:22:12.228 --> 01:22:18.100
It's as complicated as you, but it's... also simple.

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:21.003
That's what you felt in that warm summer breeze

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:23.405
as a teenager in France.

01:22:24.507 --> 01:22:26.442
Amy, I'm sorry, I can't bottle love.

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:31.247
Nobody can, because love means something different

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:32.915
to every single person.

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:37.486
Well...

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:40.156
Well then, we definitely have to cancel the launch.

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:44.293
If we can't give this mind, heart, soul opening experience

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.528
to everyone, what's the point?

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:47.463
I completely agree.

01:22:49.198 --> 01:22:50.833
Except that's really bad business.

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:53.135
That's exactly why my store went bankrupt,

01:22:53.269 --> 01:22:56.438
and... the same thing could happen to you.

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:59.642
What if we could do what you do, but on a larger scale?

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:01.977
Make a scent that would make everyone like it.

01:23:02.211 --> 01:23:05.347
That would mean making a brief for every single person.

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:06.182
That's impossible.

01:23:06.282 --> 01:23:07.183
No, it isn't.

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:08.817
What if it was set up like

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:11.020
one of those DNA ancestry type things,

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.888
where you fill out a survey,

01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:15.991
send in photos and information and all that other stuff,

01:23:16.058 --> 01:23:17.626
and they send you back your results.

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:19.295
But in this case,

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:22.131
we send back a customized perfume

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:23.499
that takes into account

01:23:23.532 --> 01:23:25.501
all of the memories of someone's life.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.703
I mean, there must be some kind of algorithm

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:29.805
that might make it easier for someone to look at.

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:32.675
And then you just add the final touches

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:34.910
to make it perfect for each person.

01:23:36.579 --> 01:23:37.413
What do you think?

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.981
That's...

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:41.250
Actually an amazing idea.

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:43.485
[George] I think it's a billion dollar idea.

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:46.021
-George! [chuckles] -Amy.

01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:50.259
This is George Maris, one of our corporate board members.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.361
I think we've already met.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:55.231
That's right. I'm her godfather.

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:57.766
It's an inside joke.

01:23:58.234 --> 01:23:59.368
You know, my tech firm

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:01.904
could handle the digital side of this concept no problem.

01:24:02.738 --> 01:24:03.572
Then it's settled.

01:24:03.672 --> 01:24:05.241
That's how we'll launch the perfume.

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:07.943
And you will have all the resources that you need,

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:09.578
including one of the most important.

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:10.879
The right space.

01:24:11.914 --> 01:24:13.382
Austin told me that our company

01:24:13.449 --> 01:24:15.050
bought out your grandmother's old shop.

01:24:16.952 --> 01:24:19.054
Well, please allow me to gift it back to you.

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:22.625
-Really? -Yes.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:24.927
It's the least I could do to thank you

01:24:25.027 --> 01:24:26.395
for what you've done for me.

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:29.431
And I hope we can do the same for others.

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:31.734
I hope so too.

01:24:34.203 --> 01:24:35.804
There's just one thing that's missing.

01:24:36.739 --> 01:24:39.742
[lighthearted music]

01:24:40.643 --> 01:24:41.977
The face of our brand.

01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:43.145
[Darian] Oh...

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:44.747
All right, you're in, shrimp puffs.

01:24:45.948 --> 01:24:46.749
Really?

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:47.916
-Really. -[Darian]You...

01:24:48.717 --> 01:24:49.551
Everyone!

01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:52.955
Launching our new perfume line...

01:24:53.622 --> 01:24:54.556
“Love”.

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:55.824
[All] To Love!

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.593
[people cheering]

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:00.095
[people laughing]

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:05.434
-[Shay laughs] -[Austin] So, wait.

01:25:05.501 --> 01:25:08.137
You really believed you created a love potion?

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.239
Like-like a real life magic love potion?

01:25:10.306 --> 01:25:14.643
Well, you were acting so strange when we first met,

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:16.278
I figured, "Well, it must be magic."

01:25:16.312 --> 01:25:19.148
Why were you so weird and awkward?

01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:21.283
'Cause I am weird and awkward.

01:25:22.184 --> 01:25:23.118
That's me.

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:26.955
And when I looked up and saw the most beautiful vision

01:25:27.022 --> 01:25:28.290
I'd ever seen in my life,

01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:31.760
I realized that I believe in love at first sight.

01:25:31.927 --> 01:25:32.761
Wait.

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:34.863
If it wasn't magic, then...

01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:37.633
why didn't you notice how bad I smelled?

01:25:37.766 --> 01:25:38.634
Oh, no, I noticed.

01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:39.601
-You noticed? -Oh yeah,

01:25:39.635 --> 01:25:40.469
-you stunk. -No!

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:42.538
You didn't say anything!

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:44.707
That's love.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:47.810
And sometimes love stinks.

01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:51.880
[lighthearted music]

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:56.385
[Darian] I don't mean to interrupt.

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.821
Actually, I really do.

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:01.623
It's time to party, let's go!

01:26:02.358 --> 01:26:03.325
Come on.

01:26:03.459 --> 01:26:04.727
[Darian chuckles]

01:26:06.228 --> 01:26:10.833
[upbeat dance music]

01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:31.186
[lighthearted music]

01:27:10.025 --> 01:27:12.628
[calming music]
