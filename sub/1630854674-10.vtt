00:02.045 --> 00:03.568
<i>Previously
on</i> Will Trent...

00:03.568 --> 00:05.657
Special Agent Mitchell is
under arrest for shooting a cop.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.137
Special Agent Mitchell was
defending herself

00:07.137 --> 00:09.226
against a criminal,
and she's coming home with me.

00:09.226 --> 00:12.882
I saw someone today that I hoped
I would never see again.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.492
I feel exactly like I did
when I was 15.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.103
I feel powerless.

00:16.103 --> 00:19.236
But the fact that I'm here
right now means I'm in control.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.759
What's my name, Trent?

00:20.759 --> 00:22.239
It's Faith Mitchell.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.545
- I investigated your mother.
- No.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.590
You ended her 30-year,
highly decorated

00:25.590 --> 00:26.722
law enforcement career.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.072
What's going on?
You can tell me.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.291
It was nothing.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.206
I'm just really glad
that Faith is okay.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.485
Hey, Sean!
You expecting company?

00:53.270 --> 00:55.533
Hey, Uncle Pete!
You seeing this?

01:04.281 --> 01:05.891
Run!

01:25.128 --> 01:27.783
It was a massacre.
One shooter?

01:27.783 --> 01:31.091
Yep.
Picked them off one by one.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.485
Not sure why GBI needs
to be involved.

01:34.485 --> 01:38.098
Here to help.
You got IDs?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.751
This is the Elmsway family.

01:39.751 --> 01:43.320
Laura Elmsway, her son, Sean,
brother Pete,

01:43.320 --> 01:44.887
and his wife, Gladys.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.151
And the shooter?

01:48.151 --> 01:49.935
Working on an ID.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.285
Uh, fentanyl!

01:51.285 --> 01:52.329
Oh, my gosh, it's fentanyl,
and I touched it!

01:52.329 --> 01:53.461
Am I gonna die?!

01:53.461 --> 01:54.810
Pretty sure that's
laundry detergent.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.333
Just wash your hands.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.292
Either way, you'll be fine.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.336
Not helping the cause, Barnes.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.816
That stuff'll kill ya.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.339
I'd rather look stupid
than be dead.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.341
Mission accomplished, snowflake.

02:06.169 --> 02:08.171
You find any drugs
on the premises?

02:08.171 --> 02:10.695
Haven't searched yet,
but Sean has had

02:10.695 --> 02:11.870
a history of dealing.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.488
That cluster of bullets
don't match the shooter's gun.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.054
Was there a second shooter?

02:33.501 --> 02:35.720
- There's someone
behind the logs!
- Get down!

02:35.720 --> 02:37.157
- Aah!
- Damn it.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.723
We've got an active shooter
at the Elmsway place.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.294
Cover me.
I'll get your guy.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.382
Yep.

02:46.818 --> 02:49.212
Come on.
Okay, come on.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.178
Keep flushing him out.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.492
I take it back.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.494
Delighted to have you with us,
Agent Trent.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.413
How you doing, kid?

03:16.413 --> 03:17.762
I am fine.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.416
Look, we both know coming back
to desk duty

03:19.416 --> 03:21.940
after administrative leave
is punishment.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.768
It's procedure.

03:23.768 --> 03:26.249
Whatever.
I'm fine with it.

03:26.249 --> 03:28.904
Hmm. You know, I'm starting
to think you picked me

03:28.904 --> 03:30.558
to be your peer counselor

03:30.558 --> 03:33.256
'cause you think
I'm a little dumb.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.431
Look, I watched Tate Grillo

03:34.431 --> 03:37.260
put a bullet
in an innocent man's head.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.088
I am not losing sleep
over shooting him.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.917
Nevertheless, I assume
you didn't become a
cop to kill people.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.788
Obviously.

03:43.788 --> 03:47.966
You know, it's a cold, hard fact
that you took a life.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.272
It's a big deal.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.753
And the day
it's not a big deal

03:51.753 --> 03:53.842
is the day that you're
a menace to society.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.193
Real talk, Faith.

03:57.193 --> 04:00.240
It ain't gotta be me, but
you need to talk to somebody.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.632
Enjoy.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.849
Ma? What--

04:44.849 --> 04:47.199
This is worse than I thought.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.940
Mom, what are you doing here?

04:48.940 --> 04:50.681
Franklin said you needed
some help.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.857
My God, this place is a mess.

04:52.857 --> 04:55.512
What is the TV doing on
in the middle of the day?

04:55.512 --> 04:56.818
I really don't need any help,

04:56.818 --> 04:58.515
and I'm sure you have
other things to do.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.865
Oh, baby,
I'm retired, remember?

05:00.865 --> 05:03.172
Oh, my God.

05:04.216 --> 05:06.262
They murdered the entire family.

05:07.524 --> 05:11.223
Went inside the trailers like
they were looking for something.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.704
Sheriff says drugs.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.837
Still, injured or not,
you'd think the shooter

05:15.837 --> 05:17.708
would want to get
the hell out of here.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.362
Maybe he was lingering
because, uh,

05:19.362 --> 05:21.843
he really wanted those drugs.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.714
He was hoping
we wouldn't find them.

05:43.386 --> 05:46.998
Hey. Hey.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.870
It's okay.

05:48.870 --> 05:51.046
It's all right.

05:51.046 --> 05:53.048
My name's Will.

05:53.048 --> 05:55.529
I'm with the Georgia Bureau
of Investigation.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.358
Do you wanna come out?

05:58.358 --> 06:01.143
Hey, I have a game.
Maybe you want to play?

06:02.623 --> 06:05.626
Okay, so, first thing is, um...

06:06.801 --> 06:10.195
...I'm gonna need you
to give me your hand.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.588
Here you go.

06:11.588 --> 06:14.243
Yeah, look at you
scooting out of there.

06:14.243 --> 06:15.940
Good job.

06:18.116 --> 06:22.120
Next thing, if it's okay
with you, I'm gonna pick you up.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.253
Here we go. Hang on.

06:24.253 --> 06:26.473
Hold on to me.
Keep those eyes closed.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.518
All right.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.435
All right.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.306
Keep those eyes closed,
all right? No cheating.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.964
Eyes are closed?
You're fine.

06:48.016 --> 06:50.540
Hey. Yeah, I'm fine.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.368
What do we know
about the shooter?

06:52.368 --> 06:54.022
<i>His name's Gary Keller.</i>

06:54.022 --> 06:56.372
<i>He and the other shooter,
Eric Young, now dead,</i>

06:56.372 --> 06:58.548
they, uh, were in and out
of prison since they were teens.

06:58.548 --> 07:01.464
B, robbery, and a whole gamut
of drug offenses.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.074
What about the dead family?

07:03.074 --> 07:05.555
One of the men, Sean Elmsway,
has a history of dealing heroin.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.949
So drug deal gone wrong?
Territory skirmish?

07:07.949 --> 07:09.951
Maybe.
But if this was about drugs,

07:09.951 --> 07:11.474
there's one problem--

07:11.474 --> 07:13.868
- Where are the drugs?
<i>- Exactly.</i>

07:13.868 --> 07:15.304
Who's that?

07:15.304 --> 07:18.350
No one.
What about your witness?

07:21.092 --> 07:23.878
Not talking.
Mm, no one knows who he is.

07:23.878 --> 07:27.403
There's no record of a child
at that address.

07:27.403 --> 07:28.796
I'll see what I can
get out of him.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.275
Keep you posted.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.625
Yeah, please do.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.324
Ma, this is my case,
so can you not--

07:35.324 --> 07:36.804
What?
You don't think my 30 years

07:36.804 --> 07:40.285
of law enforcement experience
might come in handy?

07:40.285 --> 07:43.898
We used to always talk
through your cases together.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.640
Oh, you think you know
everything now.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.293
I had a similar case in '95--

07:48.293 --> 07:50.121
Actually, I was hoping
to get through this one

07:50.121 --> 07:54.474
without breaking any laws
or being disgraced, so no.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.519
Hurtful.

07:56.519 --> 07:59.174
Your generation is very good
at blame.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.349
My generation?

08:00.349 --> 08:02.003
Are you kidding me?
You always--

08:02.003 --> 08:05.354
Wow.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.576
You know, you can still be
snippy with me, dearheart,

08:09.576 --> 08:11.839
but remember,
I am still your mother.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.275
You've been through
something serious,

08:13.275 --> 08:15.799
and I wish you'd talk to me.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.373
Hey.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.244
You ever gonna tell me
your name?

08:28.159 --> 08:29.944
It's all right.

08:29.944 --> 08:32.163
You can talk when you're ready.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.601
How about I call you Scoot
for now,

08:34.601 --> 08:36.385
since you're so good
at scooting?

08:37.908 --> 08:40.041
You hungry, Scoot?

08:40.041 --> 08:41.782
I got somebody you should meet.

08:41.782 --> 08:45.176
So, I guessed chicken nuggets,
but I also got a ton

08:45.176 --> 08:46.874
of fries and...

08:46.874 --> 08:50.878
...a Cod of Love
fish sandwich.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.967
Maybe you're the one person
who likes it.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.708
Thank you, Nico.

08:54.708 --> 08:59.016
Could you, uh, pick up
a few clothes for him,

08:59.016 --> 09:00.583
and a toothbrush, too?

09:00.583 --> 09:01.932
Sure thing.

09:09.723 --> 09:12.639
Scoot, I know it's scary,

09:12.639 --> 09:14.379
but I'm gonna have to ask you
some questions

09:14.379 --> 09:17.252
about what happened
because it's very important

09:17.252 --> 09:21.038
that we find
the bad guys who did this.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.910
You don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

09:22.910 --> 09:27.610
But maybe you can let me know
if I'm thinking the right way?

09:27.610 --> 09:29.917
These sauces are the trailers,

09:29.917 --> 09:33.660
and, uh, these fries
are the highway.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.316
Where did you stay?

09:41.668 --> 09:43.278
The barbecue trailer.

09:43.278 --> 09:46.890
That was Mr. and Mrs. Elmsway.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.631
Are they related to you?

09:52.330 --> 09:54.550
Scoot...

09:54.550 --> 09:57.640
I'm very sorry for your loss.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.687
So, the bad guys are
the chicken nuggets,

10:00.687 --> 10:04.473
and they drive on in.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.694
What did you see?

10:07.694 --> 10:09.652
Run!

10:17.138 --> 10:18.792
You see anybody else?

10:18.792 --> 10:20.445
Keep looking!

10:27.452 --> 10:29.324
There was
a third chicken nugget?

10:29.324 --> 10:30.934
Had you ever seen him before?

10:30.934 --> 10:33.502
You remember what
he looked like?

10:33.502 --> 10:36.026
Was he my size?
Taller?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.291
He's tall like Wesley?

10:40.291 --> 10:41.902
That's good.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.774
Any chance you remember
what he was wearing?

10:44.774 --> 10:47.081
White shirt?

10:47.081 --> 10:48.169
Blue shirt?

10:50.214 --> 10:52.347
Black shirt?

10:52.347 --> 10:54.436
Look at you.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.786
You must be part elephant,
with a memory like that.

10:56.786 --> 10:59.354
Will, there's, uh,
someone that's...

11:02.923 --> 11:04.359
What's wrong with your face?

11:04.359 --> 11:05.882
Oh, I get it.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.971
Okay, so, you know, before
human beings reach adulthood

11:07.971 --> 11:10.365
and they report to work,
they are small.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.496
We call them children.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.150
Actually, I should
start with babies.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.369
When two people are in love,

11:14.369 --> 11:15.675
they give each other
a special hug,

11:15.675 --> 11:17.285
and a seed gets planted.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.115
Why aren't you
ripping my head off?

11:21.115 --> 11:23.552
- Who do you have in the box?
- Known associate
of one of our victims.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.988
They were
up to no good together.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.207
What? Do you think
he has information

11:26.207 --> 11:27.556
on the cartel connection?

11:27.556 --> 11:29.036
I'm gonna talk to him now.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.168
Can you, uh,
keep the child company,

11:31.168 --> 11:32.387
or is that below your pay grade?

11:32.387 --> 11:35.956
Of course.
Carolyn! Get me some crayons.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.394
It's so messed up, man.

11:40.525 --> 11:41.526
I mean...

11:41.526 --> 11:43.180
Sean?

11:43.180 --> 11:44.225
You and Sean were
arrested together

11:44.225 --> 11:46.401
on drug charges
a few years back.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.838
Who was he dealing for?
Did you know his supplier?

11:48.838 --> 11:50.797
I don't know, "dealing"?

11:50.797 --> 11:52.755
That might be too strong a word.

11:52.755 --> 11:55.062
I mean, Sean sold a little
of his own supply

11:55.062 --> 11:57.238
to a few of his buddies
every once in a while.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.066
That's about it.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.676
What do you know about
a 6-year-old boy,

12:00.676 --> 12:02.896
possibly living with Sean?

12:02.896 --> 12:05.246
Uh, there was a cousin
used to hang around.

12:05.246 --> 12:09.424
Um, Kimmy? Klara? Klia?

12:09.424 --> 12:12.166
I-I heard she was knocked up
a few years back.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.558
Can you describe her?

12:13.558 --> 12:14.908
A skinny girl in a hoodie.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.432
Man, I was high all the time
back then.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.173
I'll put that very
detailed description

12:19.173 --> 12:20.609
into the computer
and see what I get.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.263
Thank you.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.484
Oh, is this the one?

12:29.052 --> 12:31.446
So, this guy says Sean Elmsway

12:31.446 --> 12:33.753
was just a recreational user,
nothing more.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.625
- You think he's lying?
- Or he was being lied to.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.453
Maybe Elmsway didn't want his
buddy being collateral damage

12:38.453 --> 12:40.803
in case things went down
with the cartel.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.457
Well, that didn't
help his family.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.807
Agent Trent?

12:44.807 --> 12:46.287
Susan Whitlock.

12:46.287 --> 12:47.941
I'm here from
Child Protective Services.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.464
We have
a temporary placement

12:49.464 --> 12:50.987
with a foster family
for him tonight.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.473
Hey, bud.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.954
Hey, you know,
why don't you, uh,

13:00.954 --> 13:02.303
go grab a snack
with Caroline

13:02.303 --> 13:04.871
while I talk
to this nice lady, hm?

13:04.871 --> 13:06.394
All right, thank you.

13:06.394 --> 13:08.483
See you in a bit.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.354
Right this way.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.445
Who is this family?

13:14.445 --> 13:16.230
I'm not sure what
you're asking me.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.276
How much time have you
spent there, recently?

13:19.276 --> 13:20.495
Agent Trent,
I don't understand

13:20.495 --> 13:22.236
why you're questioning
this placement.

13:22.236 --> 13:25.152
In 1998, the last foster home
that I was placed in,

13:25.152 --> 13:27.284
they told me it was great, too.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.504
Then, one day, "Mommy"--

13:29.504 --> 13:31.158
because that's what she liked
to be called--

13:31.158 --> 13:34.901
Mommy was mad because I wore a
wrinkled shirt to Sunday school.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.859
I made her look bad.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.774
But she smiled
right on through it.

13:38.774 --> 13:39.906
Then when we got home,

13:39.906 --> 13:42.256
she decided that
she would iron it...

13:42.256 --> 13:44.998
while I was wearing it.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.696
That was a great home!

13:47.696 --> 13:48.871
Would you like to see the scar?

13:48.871 --> 13:49.959
Will.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.395
Ms. Whitlock,

13:51.395 --> 13:54.485
the GBI has serious concerns
for the boy's safety.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.618
I am aware of the incident
he witnessed.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.881
Good. Then for
the child's protection,

13:58.881 --> 14:01.884
we'd like to offer
another solution.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.805
Oh, she decides to show up!

14:09.805 --> 14:11.807
Here's that report you ordered, partner.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.113
Thank you.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.549
You wanna tell me where
you've been all day?

14:14.549 --> 14:17.160
I had a meeting, and then I had
lunch with my sponsor.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.380
You had lunch with who--
with me?

14:19.380 --> 14:22.035
Unless you got another sponsor
I don't know about, you lying.

14:22.035 --> 14:24.820
- C'mon, man.
- Don't bring
me into your mess.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.695
This have anything to do
with that creep

14:30.695 --> 14:32.088
I hauled in for you last week?

14:34.351 --> 14:36.223
You want to talk about it?

14:36.223 --> 14:38.181
The man said he changed,

14:38.181 --> 14:39.922
so I got no reason
to keep looking into him.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.445
Except...?

14:42.969 --> 14:45.972
All right.
Except, when he left here,

14:45.972 --> 14:48.583
I saw his girlfriend
has a teenage daughter.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.411
And you can't get it
out of your head?

14:50.411 --> 14:52.152
No.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.762
And you want to check up on him.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.068
Uh, yeah.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.072
Okay.

15:01.422 --> 15:02.945
Okay, what?

15:02.945 --> 15:05.078
Okay, let's check up on him.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.818
It might make
that feeling go away.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.561
Mnh-mnh?

15:10.561 --> 15:12.085
All right, yeah.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.788
All right.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.268
We're all set for bed.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.052
You can keep Betty
for the night,

15:23.052 --> 15:25.968
but you gotta make sure
you pet her evenly all over.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.797
I don't want her
getting a bald spot.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.494
Okay.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.584
Scoot speaks.

15:38.285 --> 15:40.287
Oh.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.071
I'm honored.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.595
Please, speak more.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.467
Can you read me a story?

15:46.467 --> 15:50.297
How about I, uh,
make one up for you?

15:50.297 --> 15:52.125
Does that work?

15:52.125 --> 15:55.128
A long time ago,
there was a, uh...

15:56.651 --> 15:58.435
...brave, little mouse.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.915
Pterodactyl.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.135
A brave, little pterodactyl.

16:02.135 --> 16:07.053
And the, uh, pterodactyl
was missing his family.

16:07.053 --> 16:10.795
So he got on his
pterodactyl motorcycle,

16:10.795 --> 16:13.059
and he drove around
looking for them.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.278
But pterodactyls can fly.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.019
This one had a broken wing.

16:17.019 --> 16:21.067
So he looked everywhere
on his motorcycle,

16:21.067 --> 16:23.069
but he couldn't find them.

16:23.069 --> 16:26.637
And even though
he was very brave,

16:26.637 --> 16:30.032
he began to feel sad
and lonely.

16:30.032 --> 16:33.253
And so he drove
on his motorcycle

16:33.253 --> 16:34.776
to the tallest mountain,

16:34.776 --> 16:38.562
and he used his voice to screech
as loudly as he could.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.655
And the family heard him.

16:44.655 --> 16:48.833
And they flew to him,
and they hugged him.

16:48.833 --> 16:52.446
And they told him
what a cool motorcycle he had.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.666
And they were happy.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.364
The end.

16:57.364 --> 16:58.452
That's a good story.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.106
Thank you.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.630
Um, okay.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.893
How about you tell me
a story now?

17:04.893 --> 17:07.896
Maybe a story about your mom?

17:07.896 --> 17:10.377
She had to go away.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.074
But she's coming back.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.992
We got a lot in common.

17:16.992 --> 17:21.562
My mother had to go away when
I was even younger than you.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.564
Did she come back?

17:23.564 --> 17:25.305
Of course she did.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.394
And she gave
the best hugs, too.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.396
What was her name?

17:29.396 --> 17:33.008
You know, I've been doing
an awful lot of talking.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.227
It's your turn now, Scoot.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.403
Can you tell me your mom's name?

17:36.403 --> 17:40.407
Kylie.

17:40.407 --> 17:44.411
You know, since we're on
the subject of names,

17:44.411 --> 17:46.413
what's yours?

17:46.413 --> 17:48.023
Theo.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.938
Theo Davis.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.679
Theo.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.425
That's a fine name
for a brave boy.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.266
<i>You've reached
Detective Angie Polaski.</i>

18:13.266 --> 18:15.050
<i>Please leave me a message
or text me.</i>

18:16.269 --> 18:19.489
Angie, um, hey.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.231
Haven't heard from you.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.581
Um...

18:24.581 --> 18:26.757
I don't know if you were
planning to come over tonight.

18:26.757 --> 18:31.632
But, uh, I have a visitor,
a kid.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.764
We, uh, just found out
who he is.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.810
Um...

18:35.810 --> 18:38.378
his dad's in prison,
mom's M.I.A.,

18:38.378 --> 18:41.207
and, uh, the rest
of his family was killed.

18:41.207 --> 18:44.775
He's staying here.

18:44.775 --> 18:48.692
It's kind of, uh,
stirring some things up.

18:50.259 --> 18:53.132
I could use a little help.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.613
Um, you're probably busy.

18:56.613 --> 19:01.488
Yeah, anyway, if you get this,
um, give me a call.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.837
Bye.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.799
<i>It's a beautiful day
here in Atlanta at 74 degrees.</i>

19:08.799 --> 19:10.627
Feel better?

19:10.627 --> 19:13.804
That shower was amazing.

19:13.804 --> 19:16.807
- You were right.
- I know. Come sit.

19:16.807 --> 19:20.289
So I think the best thing
for you to do today--

19:20.289 --> 19:22.770
Now, mind you how right
I was about the shower--

19:22.770 --> 19:24.163
You were.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.818
The best next course of action
is to go in.

19:27.818 --> 19:29.211
Yeah, you might be right.

19:29.211 --> 19:32.301
So eat, get dressed, let's go.

19:33.433 --> 19:36.218
You mean like "Let's go, team,"
or are you trying to say...?

19:36.218 --> 19:37.437
I just need to get
my walking shoes.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.178
Just a minute.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.484
<i>♪ Seem out of place ♪</i>

19:41.484 --> 19:43.834
<i>♪ Me watchin' sunshine ♪</i>

19:49.362 --> 19:52.930
Agent Trent
and Junior Agent Theo.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.846
Deputy Director has
an important assignment for you.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.196
- Oh.
- All right, come with me.

20:00.373 --> 20:01.678
You're here?

20:01.678 --> 20:03.027
I am here.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.594
I'm here, too.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.859
Hello, Special Agent Will Trent.

20:08.859 --> 20:10.644
Long time, no see.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.950
What's it been, a few months
since you ruined my life?

20:12.950 --> 20:15.214
Six months since you ruined
your own life, yes.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.519
And by the way,
the APD has been nothing

20:16.519 --> 20:18.260
but lovely to me ever since.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.871
How are you?

20:20.871 --> 20:23.134
A pile of ash.
Thank you for asking.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.180
Mom, Will and I
need to discuss our case.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.008
Confidential details.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.705
Of course, dearheart.

20:28.705 --> 20:30.229
I want to see Mandy anyway.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.361
- All these reunions.
- Hm.

20:33.971 --> 20:36.365
Far be it from me to encourage
any impropriety

20:36.365 --> 20:38.672
amongst
law enforcement officers.

20:41.892 --> 20:44.199
Well, that went great.
What'd you find out?

20:44.199 --> 20:46.332
I looked into the financial
records of our dead shooter

20:46.332 --> 20:47.898
and his buddy
at the hospital, Gary,

20:47.898 --> 20:50.727
and get this--
they each deposited $10,000

20:50.727 --> 20:52.381
two days before the attack.

20:52.381 --> 20:54.470
So this was a paid hit?

20:58.735 --> 21:00.911
Evelyn?

21:00.911 --> 21:02.391
It's good to see you.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.088
How are you?

21:04.088 --> 21:06.830
Go screw yourself.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.658
Oh, doing that well, huh?

21:08.658 --> 21:10.573
Oh, no. I'm great.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.836
Took a while to figure out how
to maneuver this stage in life

21:12.836 --> 21:14.360
with your knife
still in my back.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.927
Oh, wow. I'm the traitor?

21:16.927 --> 21:20.496
I knew there was something
rotten in my department,

21:20.496 --> 21:22.106
so I came to you for help.

21:22.106 --> 21:24.413
I thought maybe we could
work it out together

21:24.413 --> 21:25.936
and root out the trouble.

21:25.936 --> 21:27.764
But instead...

21:27.764 --> 21:31.115
a bunch of your guys
come into my office

21:31.115 --> 21:32.856
to escort me out.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.423
Evvy, we're like family.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.556
You know that investigation
had to be by the book.

21:36.556 --> 21:37.905
That's why I put Will on the--

21:37.905 --> 21:40.951
You could have given me
a heads-up!

21:40.951 --> 21:43.737
They stormed my office, Mandy!

21:43.737 --> 21:45.956
Do you know
how humiliating that was?!

21:45.956 --> 21:48.089
Any way we handled it,
you would've been out.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.786
Consider it a blessing.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.397
We got rid
of the problem officers,

21:51.397 --> 21:52.920
and your name didn't get
dragged through the mud.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.270
Like hell it didn't.

21:55.270 --> 21:57.228
Mandy, I lost my job.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.057
It was like losing a limb.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.842
Oh, God.
That's a bit dramatic.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.324
Ma'am, the <i>Atlantic Star
Standard's</i> on line--

22:05.324 --> 22:06.586
Carolyn, hold my calls.

22:06.586 --> 22:09.415
Her name is Caroline,
for God's sake!

22:09.415 --> 22:10.894
She's your assistant.
She's got her name

22:10.894 --> 22:13.593
right on her desk!
Oh, but of course, I'm sorry.

22:13.593 --> 22:14.637
You don't care.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.250
Anything else?

22:19.250 --> 22:21.949
Ma'am, the boy's grandmother
has been located.

22:21.949 --> 22:25.169
You could've knocked me over
with a feather when they called.

22:25.169 --> 22:28.477
My son Joey always manages
to find trouble.

22:28.477 --> 22:29.913
He's in prison.

22:29.913 --> 22:33.352
Breaks my heart.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.005
He and Kylie dated, but...

22:36.877 --> 22:39.923
...I had no idea
they'd had a baby together.

22:39.923 --> 22:42.491
Theo mentioned that his, uh,
mother had to go away.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.406
I wasn't sure what he meant.

22:44.406 --> 22:48.192
She had herself mixed up
in drugs real bad.

22:48.192 --> 22:51.021
Same reason my Joey's in prison.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.807
Anyway, I have a big house
with lots of rooms

22:53.807 --> 22:57.114
and a hardware business
that Theo will love.

22:57.114 --> 22:59.290
CPS is going to have
to do an inspection,

22:59.290 --> 23:01.205
and there's some paperwork
to fill out.

23:01.205 --> 23:03.512
Okay, well, I'll just wait here
to take him home.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.775
H-How about I, um--

23:05.775 --> 23:07.864
I drop him off myself
when it's time?

23:07.864 --> 23:08.952
Great.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.519
How did she seem?

23:10.519 --> 23:11.868
Like a nice grandmother.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.696
Well, where's Theo?

23:13.696 --> 23:15.611
Oh, he's playing with Caroline.

23:15.611 --> 23:18.048
Why didn't anybody tell me
her name was Caroline?

23:18.048 --> 23:19.963
'Cause everyone
is terrified of you.

23:19.963 --> 23:22.357
Your shooter, Gary Keller,
regained consciousness.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.141
- Well, great.
Let's go talk to him.
- Can I?

23:24.141 --> 23:26.056
The citizens of Georgia
aren't paying you to sit around

23:26.056 --> 23:27.188
and talk about your feelings.

23:27.188 --> 23:28.232
Great.

23:28.232 --> 23:30.539
I'll get my purse.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.454
The shooters were hired,
and we need to find out by who.

23:32.454 --> 23:33.542
- Whom.
- Whom.

23:33.542 --> 23:34.891
You know, I think
you can flip him.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.632
This job was cheap, sloppy.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.242
Obviously,
they weren't professionals.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.505
I told you to sit
in the waiting room.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.071
You're about to have
an emotional breakdown

23:41.071 --> 23:43.247
at any second,
so I need to be here.

23:43.247 --> 23:45.249
Anyway, not that anyone
asked my opinion,

23:45.249 --> 23:48.688
but never forget
that people are dumb.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.646
Uh, I know, Will,
that you're a genius,

23:50.646 --> 23:52.735
but not everyone's
an international assassin.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.215
I've considered all of this.

23:54.215 --> 23:57.000
- Thank you, Captain Mitchell.
- Mrs. Mitchell.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.480
You know, your Aunt Mandy and I,

23:58.480 --> 24:00.874
when we wanted to get
a suspect relaxed and talking,

24:00.874 --> 24:02.223
we'd crush a Valium
into their coffee,

24:02.223 --> 24:03.442
and they'd sing like birds.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.400
Ma, please stop talking.

24:09.012 --> 24:10.753
What-- What did I say?

24:10.753 --> 24:13.452
His boss at the car
wash says he's the best worker.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.583
And the guy at the corner bar
says he plays

24:14.583 --> 24:16.280
a couple games of pool
and drinks soda.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.021
Yeah, I know. I was there.

24:18.021 --> 24:21.938
Well, they say
people can change.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.679
You believe that?

24:23.679 --> 24:24.767
God, no.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.554
That's her.

24:28.554 --> 24:31.034
All right, be back in a minute.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.296
- See you guys tomorrow. Bye.
- Bye.

24:32.296 --> 24:34.908
Crystal, hey,
can I talk to you?

24:34.908 --> 24:38.259
So, I wanted to ask you
about your mom's boyfriend.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.303
About Lenny.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.784
Who are you?

24:41.784 --> 24:43.873
I'm-- I-I'm someone
who used to know him.

24:43.873 --> 24:47.311
And, um, when I knew him...

24:47.311 --> 24:48.748
he was not someone
I could trust.

24:48.748 --> 24:51.490
He-- He...

24:51.490 --> 24:55.145
did bad things with girls.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.453
What do you mean?
Lenny's nice.

24:58.453 --> 25:01.978
Uh, has he ever done anything
that made you uncomfortable?

25:01.978 --> 25:03.719
You're kind of making me uncomfortable.

25:03.719 --> 25:07.636
I'm trying to do
the right thing here.

25:07.636 --> 25:08.811
Crystal, c'mon!

25:08.811 --> 25:09.856
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

25:09.856 --> 25:12.423
Wait, wait.
Uh, one more thing.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.818
Um, Detective Angie Polaski, okay?

25:19.343 --> 25:21.824
If you need anything...

25:21.824 --> 25:23.652
I will believe you.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.359
Did you just give her your card
with your name on it?

25:36.839 --> 25:38.841
He's gonna get you
for that one.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.539
Yeah, he's gonna get me anyway.

25:43.193 --> 25:45.544
I got all the time
in the world, Gary.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.023
Who hired you?

25:47.023 --> 25:48.677
Johnny Cash.

25:48.677 --> 25:51.462
Okay, see, my patience
is running low.

25:51.462 --> 25:52.768
I didn't say that was his name.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.770
That was the name he gave me.

25:54.770 --> 25:57.556
Obviously, his name isn't
Johnny Cash.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.384
Eric knew him,
and Eric hooked me up.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.343
Now Eric's dead.

26:02.343 --> 26:03.953
Hmm.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.694
- Johnny Cash.
- Mm-hmm.

26:05.694 --> 26:08.044
The Man in Black.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.220
Wait, who--
who's the Man in Black?

26:10.220 --> 26:13.354
Johnny Cash. Keep up.
How'd he get away?

26:13.354 --> 26:15.574
When we heard the sirens,
he took off running.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.315
I'd been hit--
hurt too much to run.

26:19.752 --> 26:22.537
What'd I tell you?
People are dumb, dumb, dumb.

26:22.537 --> 26:25.018
Johnny Cash
is the third shooter.

26:25.018 --> 26:26.367
Theo was right.

26:26.367 --> 26:27.586
And what about the drugs?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.065
- Ma, can you please?
- She's got a point.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.024
Ya think?

26:31.024 --> 26:34.680
Okay, Mrs. Mitchell,
I'm not your enemy.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.638
But this is my case
and Faith's.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.032
If you're gonna be here,
I'm assuming it's to help.

26:39.032 --> 26:41.382
And I'm happy to have
your wisdom and insight,

26:41.382 --> 26:44.603
but anything else,
I don't have time for.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.908
Are we good?

26:45.908 --> 26:47.736
Stellar.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.741
Without the drugs, this case
doesn't make any sense.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.743
You know that, right?

26:54.743 --> 26:56.440
Doesn't make any damn sense
at all.

26:58.704 --> 27:02.577
Detective Polaski?!

27:02.577 --> 27:04.013
Yep.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.799
What business do you have
scaring my daughter,

27:06.799 --> 27:07.887
giving her your card?

27:07.887 --> 27:10.193
Maybe she should be scared.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.238
Do you know who you're dating?

27:11.238 --> 27:13.196
My fiancé told you to stay--

27:13.196 --> 27:14.720
Oh, your fiancé?
Even better.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.069
Okay.

27:16.069 --> 27:18.593
Lenny is a pedophile.

27:18.593 --> 27:19.725
Ask me how I know.

27:19.725 --> 27:22.249
Okay, okay.
Let's just calm down here.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.512
He is a good man.
He paid his debt.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.383
- He didn't pay what he owes me.
- Angie, you need to settle down.

27:26.383 --> 27:28.429
Ma'am,
just take a deep breath, okay?

27:28.429 --> 27:29.909
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you not like me coming

27:29.909 --> 27:31.693
in your job, making a scene?

27:31.693 --> 27:33.913
Why are you protecting him
instead of protecting
your daughter?

27:33.913 --> 27:36.263
If I had a kid, and there was
any slightest thought

27:36.263 --> 27:39.005
that someone was preying
on them, I would--

27:39.005 --> 27:42.399
Wow. You're into it?

27:42.399 --> 27:43.923
This woman is harassing
my family.

27:43.923 --> 27:45.359
Okay, all right.
You want to file a complaint?

27:45.359 --> 27:46.534
We can do it at my desk.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.449
So it's cool if he messes
around with her

27:48.449 --> 27:49.711
as long as you get
a ring on your finger?

27:49.711 --> 27:51.582
- Is that it?
- Hey! Enough! Enough!

27:51.582 --> 27:53.628
Come on. Enough.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.717
Hey! I'm okay.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.023
- I'm all right. I'm all right.
- No, you're not.

27:57.023 --> 27:59.199
You could get fired for that!

28:00.417 --> 28:02.289
It's Lenny,

28:02.289 --> 28:04.595
the foster father that raped me
and got me pregnant,

28:04.595 --> 28:06.249
and she's his dumbass fiancée.

28:06.249 --> 28:07.555
She has
a 15-year-old daughter!

28:07.555 --> 28:08.948
Man, it makes me sick.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.384
Geez.

28:10.384 --> 28:12.125
I take it you've been
tailing him?

28:13.779 --> 28:15.955
- Well, you find anything?
- No, I didn't find anything!

28:15.955 --> 28:18.653
But I don't need to find
anything! I know! I know.

28:18.653 --> 28:19.785
He needs to be stopped.

28:19.785 --> 28:22.309
Yeah, but not like this.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.485
Now, you're scaring the hell
out of me.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.269
You talk to Will about it?

28:27.662 --> 28:29.142
- No.
- Why not?

28:29.142 --> 28:31.144
I don't know.

28:31.144 --> 28:33.276
Well, are you waiting for
somebody else to know for you?

28:33.276 --> 28:35.017
Fine, I...

28:37.803 --> 28:40.414
I haven't told Will the truth
because the truth is that...

28:42.546 --> 28:45.158
God! No matter what I say,
he's gonna know I'm lying.

28:45.158 --> 28:47.682
Okay.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.075
Practice on me.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.339
What's the truth?

28:59.346 --> 29:03.698
I have that feeling again,
you know,

29:03.698 --> 29:05.918
like I'm gonna do something.

29:05.918 --> 29:08.703
Talk to him.
Secrets, they mess you up.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.096
You know that.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.838
You gave the girl your card.
You did your part.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.536
Don't let this cat become
your next addiction.

29:15.536 --> 29:16.972
He's taken enough from you.

29:16.972 --> 29:19.018
Don't you turn around
and throw away your career,

29:19.018 --> 29:21.020
the life you built
for this sorry ass.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.545
What's Cap gonna say
when he finds out?

29:24.545 --> 29:26.677
Cap ain't gon' hear about it.

29:26.677 --> 29:28.375
I got you.

29:31.073 --> 29:33.467
This car is fantastic, honestly.

29:33.467 --> 29:37.340
It's got cup holders everywhere,
even has a built-in vacuum.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.125
Yeah, but why did you rent
a minivan?

29:39.125 --> 29:41.562
<i>You don't put a child
in a '73 Porsche.</i>

29:41.562 --> 29:43.564
Any luck on who
our Johnny Cash might be?

29:43.564 --> 29:46.393
I've got a clerk at the minimart
near the crime scene,

29:46.393 --> 29:48.003
said there was a guy
in the parking lot

29:48.003 --> 29:49.744
all winded like
he'd been running,

29:49.744 --> 29:52.225
hung around until an SUV
pulled in and picked him up.

29:52.225 --> 29:55.402
<i>I've got a tech reviewing
surveillance footage.</i>

29:55.402 --> 29:57.578
All right, keep me posted.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.580
Okay, bud. We're here.

30:02.496 --> 30:03.540
Mitchell.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.412
Oh. Uh-huh.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.892
Uh, it's something.
Thank you.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.763
Thank you, thank you.

30:08.763 --> 30:10.069
It was a green Chevy Blazer.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.244
Another guy at the wheel.

30:11.244 --> 30:12.985
No digits, though.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.078
Well, look who's here.
Hello, my boy.

30:19.078 --> 30:22.777
- Hi.
- Did you bring a friend?

30:22.777 --> 30:24.083
Nice place you got here.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.085
Gotta love a hardware store.

30:26.085 --> 30:30.698
Thanks. My late husband and I
started small, but here we are.

30:30.698 --> 30:33.048
Would you like
to meet your uncles?

30:33.048 --> 30:35.616
This is Aaron,

30:35.616 --> 30:37.748
and over there is Deacon.

30:37.748 --> 30:40.534
He's locking up.

30:40.534 --> 30:44.103
Well, um, all right, bud.

30:44.103 --> 30:46.757
Um, it's been fun hanging.

31:03.818 --> 31:07.126
Oh, you know, he, um--
he's giving me the, uh,

31:07.126 --> 31:09.128
"I need the bathroom" code.
Can we...?

31:09.128 --> 31:11.652
Back of the store,
the right-hand side.

31:11.652 --> 31:14.263
Just be a minute.
Come on.

31:21.488 --> 31:24.404
Hey. What's going on?

31:24.404 --> 31:25.622
That's the guy.

31:25.622 --> 31:27.363
The third nugget.

31:28.712 --> 31:31.150
This is Special Agent Trent
of the GBI.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.152
I need backup at
Marigold Hardware immediately.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.067
Suspects are armed.

31:43.553 --> 31:46.252
Where's Theo?!
Where's my son?!

31:46.252 --> 31:47.993
Your son is safe, Ms. Davis,

31:47.993 --> 31:50.125
but I need to ask
why you left him.

31:50.125 --> 31:54.173
It was a job in Ohio,
good money.

31:54.173 --> 31:55.435
I'm a nurse.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.002
Theo and I were staying
at my cousin's

31:57.002 --> 31:58.699
while I saved up for a place.

31:58.699 --> 32:01.658
The job was only two months,
and the shifts were 12 hours,

32:01.658 --> 32:04.574
so
I thought it would be better.

32:07.229 --> 32:08.709
Please, let me see him.

32:08.709 --> 32:11.320
My partner Will took Theo
to his grandmother's place.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.019
Kathleen Marigold?

32:14.019 --> 32:17.152
Kathleen? Why?

32:17.152 --> 32:20.025
She's been trying to get Theo
from me for a year.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.722
Ever since she found out
about him.

32:21.722 --> 32:23.506
She called CPS on me.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.813
She said I used drugs.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.557
Everything okay in there?

32:30.557 --> 32:32.167
Yep, just a minute.

32:40.349 --> 32:44.397
Okay. You crawl as far as you
can, and you stay very quiet.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.007
You gotta take care of Betty.

32:46.007 --> 32:47.574
She's counting on you.

32:47.574 --> 32:49.924
I will find you.

32:49.924 --> 32:50.969
All right, go hide.

32:59.107 --> 33:02.023
Yeah, poor little guy.
He's been backed up.

33:02.023 --> 33:04.286
You know, all that stress
with everything going on.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.421
Aaron, go get the boy.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.253
Why's the door locked?

33:14.253 --> 33:15.428
Privacy.

33:15.428 --> 33:18.083
Deacon, get his gun.

33:19.258 --> 33:20.389
Didn't bring it.
All right?

33:20.389 --> 33:22.087
I don't carry it around the boy.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.219
This all about custody,
Kathleen?

33:24.219 --> 33:25.916
You kill that family
just to make sure

33:25.916 --> 33:27.570
no one else had a claim to him?

33:27.570 --> 33:29.616
He's a Marigold.

33:29.616 --> 33:30.747
Aaron, the door!

33:35.100 --> 33:36.623
He's not in here.

33:39.278 --> 33:40.931
He must've gone up
in the ceiling.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.101
Theo!

34:20.101 --> 34:22.103
Come on out, buddy!

34:22.103 --> 34:24.279
None of this is your fault.

34:24.279 --> 34:27.152
Theo, Grandma's waiting.

34:55.397 --> 34:57.878
- Don't move!
- Stop that.

34:57.878 --> 35:01.142
Put the gun down
and tell that boy to stay put.

35:01.142 --> 35:04.145
We're coming to get him.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.320
I'm putting it down.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.669
Easy.

35:12.806 --> 35:13.894
You shot my finger off!

35:13.894 --> 35:15.896
Shut up! On your knees!

35:22.729 --> 35:23.904
Hands behind your back.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.828
There you are.

35:39.920 --> 35:44.054
Hey, you did great, Theo.
Come with me. Come on.

35:44.054 --> 35:46.231
Hold Betty, okay?
Here we go.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.146
One, two, three, all right.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.129
Now, why am I not surprised?

36:18.524 --> 36:20.526
I'm not gonna stop.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.963
I can't-- I can't do that.
You're a monster.

36:22.963 --> 36:24.660
You need to leave
my family alone.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.271
Family?

36:26.271 --> 36:28.316
What do you know about family?

36:28.316 --> 36:29.709
They--
They don't deserve this.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.146
I didn't deserve
what you did to me.

36:32.146 --> 36:33.626
Didn't you?

36:36.672 --> 36:39.719
You want some truth,
Angie-pants?

36:39.719 --> 36:42.548
You were 15 going on 30.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.158
The way you'd do the little walk
when you knew

36:44.158 --> 36:45.377
that I was watching you.

36:45.377 --> 36:48.075
The tight jeans, huh?

36:48.075 --> 36:50.077
You gave all the boys
a little taste.

36:50.077 --> 36:52.558
But what you wanted was a man.

36:54.864 --> 36:57.084
And all I did was give you one.

36:57.084 --> 37:00.914
15 is 15.

37:00.914 --> 37:03.046
And you are still garbage.

37:03.046 --> 37:04.091
I knew it.

37:04.091 --> 37:06.920
Well, pot, meet kettle.

37:10.924 --> 37:12.273
Hey, Lenny.

37:14.406 --> 37:16.756
Enjoy your day.
I mean that.

37:16.756 --> 37:19.106
Go see a movie or something.
Make it nice.

37:19.106 --> 37:22.588
Because I'm gonna kill you.

37:22.588 --> 37:25.112
And you will never
see it coming.
