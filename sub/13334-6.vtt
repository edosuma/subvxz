WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:01.468
.

00:07.073 --> 00:09.943
The Geordies are back in the Toon.
Wicked.

00:10.009 --> 00:13.947
(cheering)
We are doing what we do best.

00:14.013 --> 00:15.715
Partying...
Whoo!

00:16.549 --> 00:18.017
Tashing on...

00:18.084 --> 00:19.586
Getting mortal...

00:19.652 --> 00:21.154
Shagging...

00:22.088 --> 00:23.590
It's insane.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.960
(screams)

00:30.029 --> 00:31.765
Shit's about to get real.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.099
Oi, oi.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.901
Oh, my God!

00:34.968 --> 00:38.905
Oh, my God, there's a new boy in the
house and it's me best friend, Kyle.

00:38.972 --> 00:42.208
Welcome to Geordie Shore.
Please enter here or here.

00:42.275 --> 00:44.944
I'm buzzing
to get this party started.

00:45.011 --> 00:48.448
I can't fucking wait
to see Gary's reaction.

00:48.515 --> 00:51.985
If he tries to mug me off,
I'll make his life hell.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.854
Next thing I know,
I'm necking on with Kyle.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.623
He doesn't waste any time.

00:56.689 --> 01:00.126
If Kyle wants to get on,
he needs to be with the lads.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.397
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.600
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.036
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.238
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:12.305 --> 01:14.207
Never kiss without a six-pack.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.142
Hardest graft is doing me hair.

01:16.209 --> 01:18.778
Cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:18.845 --> 01:20.647
I'm fake, flirty
and I've got FFs.

01:20.713 --> 01:22.615
I'll make sparks fly.

01:22.682 --> 01:25.485
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.733
I wake up in bed with Marnie.
I can't remember much

01:40.800 --> 01:44.637
but I do remember that I didn't
buck her and we've got a new lad

01:44.704 --> 01:47.340
and I did kiss him.
Did you kiss Kyle?

01:47.407 --> 01:48.608
No.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.444
He kissed me for starters.

01:51.511 --> 01:54.380
Fuck's sake, I was only
trying to do Marnie a favour.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.851
I only necked on with Kyle
to keep him away from Gary.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.519
I'm such a good friend.

02:08.360 --> 02:13.533
Last night did you see when Kyle and
Vicky came together and kind of...

02:16.970 --> 02:19.839
I'm not surprised Vicky
got in there with Kyle first.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.808
I do think he's fit
but what can I do?

02:23.009 --> 02:25.845
I think he's hot.
I'd flirt with him happily,

02:25.912 --> 02:29.983
but I don't wanna have sex with him.
Don't wanna shit on my own doorstep.

02:30.049 --> 02:32.252
I've done it too many times.
I know.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.490
This time around,
the lads are such a tight group.

02:37.557 --> 02:40.159
I don't know how it's gonna pan out.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.095
It's gonna be a bit weird today.

02:42.161 --> 02:45.131
We've became so close as a four.

02:45.198 --> 02:49.002
It's like we've got our own
fucking square of justice.

02:50.503 --> 02:54.641
We've gotta make it into a fucking
pentagon? It's a radge shape, that.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.844
I'm pleased the whole
me and Marnie thing is over

02:57.911 --> 03:01.214
but Marnie's already been trying
to get in Kyle's head

03:01.281 --> 03:03.583
and that's the reason
he didn't say hello.

03:10.623 --> 03:13.993
Kyle's gonna make his own opinions
on the people here.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.866
Gary's face last night when Kyle
walked in was priceless.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.701
It made me feel a lot better.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.571
Gary's first reaction was like
really shocked.

03:24.637 --> 03:28.841
Was it good shock, bad shock?
It was like, not-in-control shock.

03:28.908 --> 03:31.544
Having a friend
in the house already is class.

03:31.611 --> 03:34.080
I know Marnie
will give us the lowdown.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.149
Me and Gary aren't really speaking.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.985
Why? We got together a few times.
Yeah.

03:40.987 --> 03:43.423
Like, two or three times.
Have you? Yeah.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.292
I've slept in his bed
more times though. Aye.

03:46.359 --> 03:48.361
You didn't put out straight away?

03:48.428 --> 03:51.531
I sort of did, yeah.
(laughs)

03:51.598 --> 03:55.802
Then I've seen how much of a fucking
prick he is, now I don't like him.

03:55.868 --> 03:58.037
It's nice to talk to someone new

03:58.104 --> 04:00.406
when they're not trying
to impress Gary.

04:00.473 --> 04:04.644
Do you think there's anyone else you
might get with? Aaron's gorgeous.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.179
He's a nice lad.

04:06.245 --> 04:08.982
Would you never...
go there with Aaron?

04:09.048 --> 04:12.218
I couldn't cos of Gary. Yeah.
I couldn't now.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.720
I do like Aaron

04:13.786 --> 04:17.824
and a part of us wishes I'd went
there with him rather than Gary

04:17.890 --> 04:19.559
but I've gotta live with it.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.330
(doorbell rings)

04:25.465 --> 04:27.767
Well, hello.
Well, hello.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.103
How is Kyle settling in?
Spot on.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.605
Making him feel welcome?
(all) Yeah.

04:32.672 --> 04:36.309
Anna, the boss, comes round to see
how Kyle's settling in

04:36.376 --> 04:40.880
and also to tell us we've got work.
We've got another bar crawl tonight.

04:40.947 --> 04:45.284
And I want Kyle,
you're working with Aaron.

04:45.351 --> 04:48.421
And I'd like Vicky to go along
with Marnie.

04:48.488 --> 04:52.525
I'm really buzzing for tonight,
there could be loads of fit birds

04:52.592 --> 04:55.495
or there could be Vicky.
A standard bar crawl,

04:55.561 --> 04:58.464
no necking on with clients,
understood?

04:58.531 --> 04:59.666
Yeah.
Excellent.

04:59.732 --> 05:03.202
I don't know why Anna wastes time
telling us the rules,

05:03.269 --> 05:06.372
no-one ever listens.
Everything she says, just ignore.

05:06.439 --> 05:08.608
Neck on, drink.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.210
It's me, Kyle, Marnie
and Vicky at work tonight.

05:11.277 --> 05:14.747
I'll show the new lad how it's done
before Vicky puts a bite on him.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.055
Me and Kyle are getting ready,

05:22.121 --> 05:25.358
my advice is to neck on
with every bird there.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.427
Work is fucking mint.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.163
We go to work to get pissed
and neck on

05:30.229 --> 05:33.700
and make other people pissed.
It's just an easy job, isn't it?

05:33.766 --> 05:36.969
I was having a little chat
with Marnie earlier. Aye.

05:37.036 --> 05:40.339
And it sounded like...
she fancied you, like.

05:40.406 --> 05:43.743
Kyle's dropped the bombshell
that Marnie fancies us.

05:43.810 --> 05:47.647
I hoped she'd said that first night,
now I can't go there.

05:47.714 --> 05:52.085
I think Marnie, she's gorgeous like,
but I couldn't do that to Gaz, like.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.987
Do you think he'd be bothered?
I don't know,

05:55.054 --> 05:58.091
I think he'd just be disappointed
that I've went there.

05:58.157 --> 06:02.095
Now I know she fancies us, it makes
it ten times harder to stay away.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.799
See you. Bye.
Bye-bye.

06:09.168 --> 06:13.473
Off to work. I hope there's loads of
fit birds for us to neck on with.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.678
Hi.
You all right?

06:18.745 --> 06:21.214
Fuck's sake. It's full of cock.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.784
We'll have a little toast
to Kyle's first night at work.

06:24.851 --> 06:28.087
Let's get pissed.
Do we need more shots?

06:31.424 --> 06:34.160
Whoa, go on lad! Yes.

06:34.227 --> 06:38.498
Can't believe this is work, getting
people pissed and having a party.

06:38.564 --> 06:42.201
Easiest job ever, I just wish
there was some birds here.

06:50.676 --> 06:53.346
He's a nice lad
and he's a good-looking lad.

06:53.412 --> 06:56.249
Go on, Hol. He is though.
He's a good-looking lad.

07:00.052 --> 07:03.189
Is it that fucking obvious?
Yes, I fancy him.

07:03.256 --> 07:07.493
But there's no point. Vicky fancies
him. I don't stand a chance.

07:09.829 --> 07:13.266
You've got 32 treble Z tits,
he's not looking at your shoes.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.905
Now we're off to meet the others.
I can't wait to get smashed.

07:25.645 --> 07:28.514
It's time to get to Bijoux
and meet the others.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.562
The drink's making us
super confident

07:42.628 --> 07:45.798
cos I wanna tell Aaron
exactly how I feel.

07:52.004 --> 07:56.209
Marnie says she regrets getting with
Gaz and she wish she'd got with me.

07:56.275 --> 07:59.345
What do you want us to do,
build a fucking time machine?

08:05.051 --> 08:08.387
We get to Bijoux and everyone
is already absolutely mortal.

08:08.454 --> 08:12.291
It's time to get pissed and show Kyle
what a real night out is.

08:15.795 --> 08:19.465
I can see Holly and Kyle flirting
and I'm honestly not bothered.

08:19.532 --> 08:24.370
All it was was a cheeky neck on,
so if Holly's interested, crack on.

08:26.572 --> 08:29.842
I need to tell Gaz the crack
about me and Marnie.

08:29.909 --> 08:31.677
This might not go down well.

08:39.284 --> 08:43.054
Gaz needs to know what a good mate
I am. I wanna go there with Marnie.

08:43.121 --> 08:46.225
I'd like to think you'd do the same
but I wouldn't bet on it.

08:49.729 --> 08:53.532
I tell Aaron to go there with Marnie
but he's adamant he's not gonna.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.868
For that, I respect him a lot.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.810
Me and Kyle are getting really,
really flirty

09:04.877 --> 09:08.814
and I think he's hot, but I don't
think I'd shag him. Hmmmm!

09:14.720 --> 09:17.657
What a night. The housemates
gave us a proper welcome.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.826
It's time to get back and see
if anything happens with Holly.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.067
What's going on here, like?

09:31.070 --> 09:34.473
We get back to the house
and it's absolute carnage.

09:38.210 --> 09:42.949
The house has turned into a winter
wonderland. It's Christmas time!

09:47.053 --> 09:49.956
(screams)

09:57.930 --> 10:01.767
It doesn't seem fair on Kyle
that all the boys are in one room

10:01.834 --> 10:03.069
and he's downstairs.

10:03.135 --> 10:06.706
Fuck it, we'll get his mattress,
put it in our room, slumber party.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.277
I'm pure epic at moving mattresses,

10:11.344 --> 10:13.813
they might as well call us
the mattress king.

10:25.224 --> 10:27.827
Me and Kyle are in the kitchen alone.

10:30.329 --> 10:31.831
I'm gonna kiss him.

10:33.766 --> 10:34.767
Good night.

10:37.269 --> 10:40.506
Wait, I'm kissing him.
Oh, my God, I've kissed the new boy.

10:42.274 --> 10:45.077
I'm going to bed now.
Good night.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.280
Oh, shit. Sassy Holly
didn't last long, did she?

10:49.281 --> 10:52.051
First day in the house
has been amazing.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.286
I could get used to this place.

10:56.722 --> 11:00.526
I can see Aaron pulling and I can't
help but feel a bit jealous.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.563
Get in! Kyle's come in,
now I'm a slut again.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.333
Fucking mint.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.835
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:11.904 --> 11:12.104
.

11:14.774 --> 11:14.974
.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.691
Last night was mint.

11:32.758 --> 11:36.729
I necked on with Holly but no-one
saw it, so does it really count?

11:39.632 --> 11:42.368
Me and Marnie admitted
that we fancied each other.

11:42.435 --> 11:46.005
Even though Gaz gave us permission,
I just can't go there.

11:52.111 --> 11:53.746
She's trying to play games.

11:57.850 --> 12:01.120
I get on well with Marnie
but when she's saying that

12:01.187 --> 12:03.789
obviously I'm gonna tell Gaz,
he's me best mate.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.958
Who's Marnie to tell me I can't pull

12:06.025 --> 12:09.962
when she fancies my best mate
and wants to neck on with him?

12:10.029 --> 12:13.065
That's where lads stick together,
girls haven't a clue.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.808
The boys need to get
out of this mad house,

12:22.875 --> 12:26.412
and go for a few chilled out drinks.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.648
Bye, have fun.
See you later.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.620
Hi, girls.
Hi. How are youse?

12:34.687 --> 12:37.490
Hi, girls.
Come into our humble abode.

12:37.556 --> 12:40.893
The girls need to be pampered.
I'm turning the living room

12:40.960 --> 12:42.795
into a nail salon for the day.

12:44.930 --> 12:48.167
Char, you all right?
You're kinda quiet.

12:48.234 --> 12:52.538
I've organised this and I'm sitting
with my face like a smacked arse.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.407
Are you missing Mitch?
I am, you know.

12:55.474 --> 12:58.277
Take some time out and see him.

12:59.011 --> 13:01.747
I'll always come back.
You're not leaving me again.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.618
Oh!
Cheers, mate.

13:05.684 --> 13:09.455
It's nice to get out the house, have
a bit of lad banter and a few pints.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.157
Cheers, lads.
Cheers, boys.

13:11.223 --> 13:12.725
How you enjoying it, Kyle?

13:12.791 --> 13:14.827
Really good.
Absolutely loving it.

13:14.894 --> 13:17.062
Kyle and Holly
were all over each other.

13:17.129 --> 13:20.599
I hope he hasn't went there
cos he's already been with Vicky.

13:20.666 --> 13:23.369
I thought she was getting
a bit flirty. Who? Holly.

13:24.870 --> 13:28.440
Nah. I think you did, aye.
Did ya, Kyle? Did ya?

13:28.507 --> 13:30.176
(cheering)

13:30.242 --> 13:32.411
Aye, I did, aye. All right?

13:34.146 --> 13:36.782
Nah.
(cheering)

13:36.849 --> 13:39.852
Kyle's already playing
a very dangerous game.

13:39.919 --> 13:43.856
He necks on with Vicky then gets with
Holly and Vicky doesn't know yet.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.024
He's fucked.

13:51.063 --> 13:54.500
Mate, if she finds out...
I can't wait, mate.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.968
I'm not bothered by her.

13:59.104 --> 14:01.974
So, last night I kissed Kyle
and I know

14:02.041 --> 14:06.178
that Vicky got there first,
but I've just gotta come clean.

14:06.245 --> 14:10.216
Erm, I kissed Kyle last night.
Oh, God.

14:10.282 --> 14:14.086
You're bang out of order.
Bang out of order.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.689
Oh, no.
Awkward.

14:16.755 --> 14:20.025
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Fuck off, I don't want your apology.

14:20.092 --> 14:23.229
You can have him back.
I don't fucking want him back now.

14:23.295 --> 14:26.966
If everyone in this house got
protective over who they've kissed,

14:27.032 --> 14:29.535
we'd constantly be
at each other's throats.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.638
If Holly wants Kyle,
be my fucking guest.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.809
Don't apologise,
I only learnt his name today.

14:38.277 --> 14:43.215
I'm so glad that she's not bothered
cos if I wanted to buck him, I could.

14:43.282 --> 14:44.783
Hiya.
Hi, lads.

14:44.850 --> 14:47.286
We've had our nails done,
feeling amazing.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.722
Now it's off out to House of Smith.

14:56.795 --> 14:59.365
We're gonna have
a pure pinging night. Come on!

15:02.167 --> 15:05.170
We're gonna have a fucking laugh
and pull some birds,

15:05.237 --> 15:07.840
bar James, but he'll join
the banter, wicked.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.411
I'm not very good
at spotting mingers.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.456
So we're in House of Smith, the tunes
are bouncing, we're all dancing.

15:24.523 --> 15:26.425
I'm gonna get fucking mortal.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.000
I'm absolutely mortal.

15:35.067 --> 15:39.038
I'm sorry but I think the only thing
I'm spotting is the vodka bottle.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.380
Kyle is the only lad
who's not pulling

15:48.447 --> 15:51.950
and Vicky doesn't mind me necking on
with him, so I make a move.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.495
Me and Kyle are talking
about the kiss.

16:03.562 --> 16:06.965
If he plays his cards right,
he might get another one tonight.

16:17.376 --> 16:22.214
I spot a blondie I've already necked
on with, so this should be easy.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.283
I've got this in the bag.

16:24.350 --> 16:29.488
I can see Aaron pulling a girl and
I can't help but feel a bit jealous.

16:34.593 --> 16:36.829
I turn my back for two seconds

16:36.895 --> 16:40.632
and Scotty T is trying to pull my
bird again, is he having a laugh?

16:42.968 --> 16:45.104
No, listen, Aaron...

16:45.170 --> 16:50.242
Aaron doesn't realise he's pulling
the bird Scott banged at the party.

16:57.449 --> 17:02.388
Scotty T's been caught red-handed
so he storms off. Fucking prick.

17:09.828 --> 17:13.065
Charlotte's acting weird
and she's not having a good time.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.767
I hope she's all right.

17:20.071 --> 17:24.443
I've tried my hardest to get into
the night but I need to see Mitch.

17:27.479 --> 17:30.716
I want the best for Charlotte
but don't want her to leave.

17:36.255 --> 17:40.659
It's just like I'm popping
to get some milk from the shop.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.929
But instead, I'm just going
to get my boyfriend's cock.

17:53.105 --> 17:57.042
Charlotte might have left but Kyle's
doing a good job of cheering me up.

17:57.109 --> 18:01.113
I hope when we get back it's Sassy
Holly that walks through the door.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.830
We get back and I've only got
one thing on my mind.

18:19.765 --> 18:24.770
Go on, son. Aaron eventually
might lose his house virginity.

18:35.714 --> 18:38.851
Me and Kyle are giving
the "come to the bedroom" look.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.120
Come to the bedroom now.

18:56.235 --> 18:59.104
Banging on the water bed
is a fucking nightmare.

18:59.171 --> 19:02.641
I've gotta put one leg on the floor
just to get a rhythm.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.009
Get in.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.144
(laughs)

19:08.280 --> 19:11.183
I'm in bed with Holly, fucking mint.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.853
Me and Kyle are in bed
and we're rolling around.

19:15.787 --> 19:18.190
And we're kissing...
and we're touching.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.294
What the fuck? I'm meant to be sassy!

19:22.361 --> 19:25.764
Kyle's come in, fucked up my
Feng Shui, now I'm a slut again.

19:25.831 --> 19:26.932
Well fucking done.

19:31.303 --> 19:34.172
If Kyle thinks that
he can pull random girls,

19:34.239 --> 19:36.441
he's got another
fucking thing coming.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.678
All I wanna do is kiss him.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.881
Tash On Tours, we're taking it
international. (cheering)

19:42.948 --> 19:45.984
I hope the birds are lethal
and ready for Scotty T's dick.

19:46.051 --> 19:48.520
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

19:50.556 --> 19:50.756
.

19:53.358 --> 19:53.559
.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.443
Get in.
I lost my house virginity.

20:17.616 --> 20:21.386
My hangover's even worse than
what I thought it was gonna be.

20:21.453 --> 20:23.522
I've woke up
and I'm absolutely dying.

20:23.589 --> 20:25.924
What the fuck
even happened last night?

20:25.991 --> 20:29.227
I can't even remember leaving.
I can't really remember.

20:30.228 --> 20:33.765
(cheering, applause)

20:33.832 --> 20:37.035
Go on, son.
I feel like a proud parent.

20:46.545 --> 20:50.215
I wake up in the girls' room
with only Marnie there.

20:50.282 --> 20:54.386
I know Charlotte left to see Mitch,
that leaves Holly unaccounted for.

20:54.453 --> 20:57.856
There's only one place
she could be. (cheering)

20:58.790 --> 21:01.093
Yes! Urgh, sex bed.

21:01.159 --> 21:03.929
Shit! Fuck!
Vicky and Marnie have woken me up.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.798
I'm guessing everyone knows
I've slept with Kyle.

21:06.865 --> 21:10.068
It wasn't like proper sex.
Like, it went in a few times.

21:10.135 --> 21:12.037
Did it happen here?
Yeah.

21:12.104 --> 21:16.141
I know Holly likes to think she can
just shag around but she can't.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.378
When she has sex with someone,
she develops feelings.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.847
If I shagged him,
he wouldn't be able to walk.

21:21.913 --> 21:24.650
Just gave him a taste.
A little taste.

21:24.716 --> 21:27.686
I think Kyle and Holly
would be so cute together.

21:27.753 --> 21:30.789
Much more suited than Kyle
and Vicky. They match better.

21:30.856 --> 21:35.093
Can we get out of this fucking bed?
Cos I feel really uncomfortable.

21:41.366 --> 21:42.768
(phone rings)

21:42.834 --> 21:44.469
Phone.
Phone.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.942
Hello.
"Hi, Gary?"

21:51.009 --> 21:53.011
You all right?
"It's Anna."

21:53.078 --> 21:58.116
"I've got another singles' night for
you to run, this time in Leeds."

21:58.183 --> 22:01.453
(Yorkshire accent) I love Leeds me,
it's fucking wicked.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.322
"I've arranged a minibus
to pick you all up."

22:05.157 --> 22:08.326
"No, you're coming home.
I expect you to behave." Right.

22:08.393 --> 22:10.495
All right, kid?

22:10.562 --> 22:13.965
Right, all at work, but in Leeds.
What? (cheering)

22:14.032 --> 22:19.304
We're taking Tash On Tours to Leeds.
Fucking hell, more fanny for me.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.006
Mans can't get enough.

22:21.073 --> 22:25.777
One downfall, it's a minibus. We're
going, doing work and coming back.

22:25.844 --> 22:30.082
We're buzzing to leave Newcastle,
even if it is just for the night.

22:30.148 --> 22:34.219
James, you're fucking hanging as
well, mate, are you gonna enjoy it?

22:34.286 --> 22:36.054
(laughing)

22:36.121 --> 22:39.658
I feel sick thinking about it.
Normally I'd love summat like that,

22:39.725 --> 22:42.227
but not now.
Couldn't think of anything worse.

22:42.294 --> 22:46.264
There's no way I'm gonna manage this
trip, so I'm gonna pie it off.

22:46.331 --> 22:47.666
Come on then, crew.

22:50.769 --> 22:52.170
Enjoy Leeds, guys.

22:52.237 --> 22:54.973
I'm not gonna bother
coming down to Leeds.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.777
I'm really missing Kate, it's
important I go and see her today.

22:58.844 --> 23:02.814
Enjoy your first fucking road trip.
See you soon, honey. Have fun, Ken!

23:02.881 --> 23:05.617
If Charlotte and James fuck off,
doesn't matter.

23:05.684 --> 23:08.553
Everyone else is single.
More fun for us.

23:12.991 --> 23:14.860
(horn sounds)

23:14.926 --> 23:17.529
The minibus turns up,
beep, beep, beep.

23:17.596 --> 23:20.165
Hello. Oh, God.
Hello, hello.

23:20.232 --> 23:24.269
Open the door to find out my granddad
is driving the minibus.

23:24.336 --> 23:28.240
Buzzing to see him but it's weird.
While I'm here, can I have a look?

23:28.306 --> 23:33.111
Things get a whole lot worse when
my granddad steps into the house.

23:35.947 --> 23:39.050
Everyone knows stuff
that could really embarrass us.

23:39.117 --> 23:42.120
Get my granddad in and out
as quick as I can.

23:42.187 --> 23:47.292
The minibus turns up and our driver
is Gary's granddad, awkward.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.794
Where's Marnie again?

23:50.762 --> 23:54.599
Gaz's granddad walks in, the first
thing he says is, "Where's Marnie?"

23:54.666 --> 23:56.902
Hello.
I'm Marnie, are you all right?

23:56.968 --> 24:00.639
If I was Marnie right now, I'd
look like a tomato. Cringe city.

24:00.705 --> 24:04.576
Gary, why don't you show him where
the magic happens? Maybe not.

24:04.643 --> 24:06.478
No bucking for you tonight.

24:20.525 --> 24:23.762
It's time to show the people
of Leeds how it's done.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.771
At the club, it's not the
biggest Tash on Tour ever,

24:32.838 --> 24:37.142
but it's not the size of it, it's
what you do with it that counts.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.044
Let's buck the face off Leeds.

24:39.110 --> 24:42.848
(whistles) Welcome to Tash On Tours,
are youse all single?

24:42.914 --> 24:43.949
(cheering)

24:44.015 --> 24:46.117
Are youse all ready to tash on?

24:47.652 --> 24:49.554
First game is pass the ice cube.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.490
(cheering)

25:01.867 --> 25:03.735
Now you got to know each other...

25:07.472 --> 25:11.009
Kyle's chatting to a load of other
girls and I'm not bothered.

25:11.076 --> 25:15.213
We haven't even properly had sex yet,
so I can't get jealous.

25:16.514 --> 25:17.515
Can I?

25:27.292 --> 25:28.760
She's starting to like him.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.339
Holly says she's not bothered
if Kyle pulls,

25:41.406 --> 25:43.675
but I can tell that she's lying.

25:50.615 --> 25:54.319
I have had too many relationships
go wrong in this house, with Kyle

25:54.386 --> 25:56.254
it's best if I play it cool.

26:00.325 --> 26:01.626
The lip sticker game.

26:01.693 --> 26:06.164
You run around and try and neck on
with as many people as possible.

26:13.371 --> 26:16.508
Holly's playing it cool
and hasn't spoke to us all night

26:16.574 --> 26:20.679
but at least this gives me a chance
for a quick no-strings neck on.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.890
Now the work's done, we're off
to the club to get smashed.

26:31.957 --> 26:33.892
Feeling fresh as a fucking lamb.

26:43.568 --> 26:46.538
The boys have brought loads
of girls with them, great.

26:46.604 --> 26:50.475
Another night of being ignored
by the boys.

26:51.609 --> 26:56.481
If Kyle thinks he can pull,
then come back and try and pull me,

26:56.548 --> 26:58.750
he's got another
fucking thing coming.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.091
I'm not listening
to a word Aaron's saying,

27:06.157 --> 27:09.561
cos all I wanna do is grab his face
and kiss him.

27:14.265 --> 27:19.270
It's frustrating me and Marnie like
each other, but she knows the crack.

27:28.346 --> 27:30.248
Tonight has been horrible.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.618
The boys have been off pulling
and ignoring us again.

27:33.685 --> 27:37.489
I just wish that Charlotte was here.
Thank fuck the bus is coming.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.727
The Geordies have rocked
the Tash On Tours.

27:42.794 --> 27:46.564
It's time to get on the bus,
get back to the fucking Toon.

27:49.734 --> 27:51.302
Even though I'm smashed,

27:51.369 --> 27:55.206
I think now would be a good time
to sort things out.

28:05.383 --> 28:09.187
Gary says he was happier when he
didn't pull and went home with me

28:09.254 --> 28:12.290
but he talks shit.
I don't believe a word he says.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.735
Me and Gary were never gonna work.
He'll never change.

28:23.802 --> 28:25.970
We should've stayed friends.

28:28.073 --> 28:31.609
We've eventually got back
and fuck me, that journey was ill.

28:31.676 --> 28:35.013
I'm off to bed because Scotty T
needs his beauty sleep.

28:37.415 --> 28:41.719
I'm not sure if Holly is pissed off
cos she goes to bed. Fuck's sake.

28:57.769 --> 29:00.572
Is Marnie coming or going?
Is it Aaron or Gaz?

29:18.623 --> 29:20.859
You all right?
Hi. What's happening?

29:20.925 --> 29:22.060
How are ya?

29:22.127 --> 29:24.929
I feel mint, me.
Great, I'm glad you do.

29:24.996 --> 29:28.900
James is back and lucky him got to
miss out on going to fucking work.

29:28.967 --> 29:32.637
I wish I could've had a romantic
break with Kate. How was Leeds?

29:32.704 --> 29:35.740
The lads pulled, we watched,
and that was it.

29:35.807 --> 29:37.742
It's nice to have James back.

29:37.809 --> 29:40.645
All we need is Charlotte,
and the gang's back.

29:40.712 --> 29:42.247
Hi.
Hello.

29:42.313 --> 29:43.381
Hi.

29:43.448 --> 29:47.919
Anna walks in. Fuck's sake, she
can't be sending us to work again.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.654
Got some exciting news.

29:49.721 --> 29:53.224
Because you've being doing so well
on Tash On Tours,

29:53.291 --> 29:56.761
we're taking it international.
(cheering)

29:58.596 --> 30:02.333
Pinging. I hope we're off
to Ibiza or somewhere proper hot.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.371
Tonight you're gonna be hosting
a singles' event in Reykjavik.

30:07.872 --> 30:09.407
Where?

30:10.608 --> 30:12.343
I don't know where the fuck it is,

30:12.410 --> 30:16.047
but I hope the birds are lethal
and ready for Scotty T's dick.

30:16.114 --> 30:17.949
We're all off to fucking Iceland,

30:18.016 --> 30:23.054
but all those thick bastards have
got no clue where the fuck it is.

30:23.121 --> 30:25.823
I have a phrase book
and a tour guide.

30:27.792 --> 30:29.327
Do Newcastle proud.

30:29.394 --> 30:32.063
Thank you, Anna, love you.
Enjoy. Thanks, Anna.

30:32.130 --> 30:35.967
Us boys are getting on so well.
We are a force to be reckoned with.

30:36.034 --> 30:39.237
Never mind hitting Recktanstick...
What's it called?

30:44.375 --> 30:47.412
I'm wondering if the lads
are gonna struggle to pull

30:47.478 --> 30:50.848
with the language barrier, but
they've got shit chat-up lines.

30:50.915 --> 30:54.385
How the fuck do you pronounce that?
Brubby.

30:54.452 --> 30:57.088
Iceland, here we fucking go.
Come on.

30:57.155 --> 31:00.658
Is Sweden not near Iceland?
Not according to these pictures.

31:00.725 --> 31:03.928
Let me find out for you.
They're blonde in Sweden though.

31:03.995 --> 31:06.364
There's no way
I'm going without Charlotte.

31:06.431 --> 31:09.901
I'm gonna give her a ring,
tell her to get to the airport.

31:09.968 --> 31:12.170
(phone rings)

31:12.237 --> 31:14.973
"Hello." Hi, Charlotte.
"What's been going on?"

31:15.039 --> 31:17.508
You need to meet us
in Gatwick airport

31:17.575 --> 31:20.411
because we're going to Iceland.

31:23.514 --> 31:28.519
Either in the Northern or Southern
hemisphere, I'm not too sure.

31:28.586 --> 31:32.323
But I have other things
to tell you as well. "Right, OK."

31:32.390 --> 31:35.426
I've been dying to talk
to Charlotte about Kyle.

31:35.493 --> 31:39.597
So the night that you decided to
leave, I ended up in bed with Kyle.

31:39.664 --> 31:43.167
"Oh, my God." (laughs)

31:44.135 --> 31:48.273
It wasn't proper sex or anything,
it was like a bit of a dip.

31:51.075 --> 31:54.479
I suppose. I'll let you go
and see you at Gatwick.

31:54.545 --> 31:56.714
"Right. See you soon."
Love you, bye.

31:57.715 --> 32:00.385
Charlotte's coming,
the family is back together.

32:00.451 --> 32:01.853
We're going to Iceland.

32:06.391 --> 32:09.560
(chants) Iceland, Iceland, Iceland.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.065
Cannot fucking wait.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.736
Iceland, here we fucking go.

32:18.803 --> 32:20.038
Iceland, Iceland!

32:20.104 --> 32:22.307
Girls on this arm, that arm.
Come on!

32:22.373 --> 32:26.411
One minute I'm dancing, the next
I'm reaching for the nearest bucket.

32:26.477 --> 32:29.881
I'm fucked. Aaron's pulled.
I fucking hate Iceland.

32:29.947 --> 32:32.550
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

32:34.485 --> 32:34.686
.

32:37.288 --> 32:37.488
.

32:46.964 --> 32:50.101
We're at the airport
and there's no sign of Charlotte.

32:50.168 --> 32:54.739
I told her to meet us here and if she
doesn't I'm gonna flip. Wha-hey!

32:54.806 --> 32:57.508
Whoo, I'm here.

32:59.277 --> 33:00.678
Are you excited?
Buzzing.

33:00.745 --> 33:03.548
Howay then. Let's gaan to Iceland.
I'm buzzing.

33:03.614 --> 33:07.318
I've made the flight and everyone's
here. It's good to be back.

33:07.385 --> 33:09.654
Charlotte. Charlotte.
I missed ya.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.823
Oh, hi, Hol.
(laughs)

33:11.889 --> 33:16.361
Charlotte's here, I'm buzzing, I
can't wait to get away, bring it on.

33:19.964 --> 33:22.767
We're all checked in.
It's time to get on that plane,

33:22.834 --> 33:26.771
hit Iceland and warm up some of them
fucking Icelandic birds. Come on.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.687
Kyle ends up sitting next to me.
I think, "What the hell?"

33:42.754 --> 33:46.891
Maybe the gods of the sky know that
we need to talk about what happened.

34:00.438 --> 34:03.374
I can't concentrate
cos Holly's stroking me arm.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.284
Kyle's got a semi-on, on the plane.

34:14.351 --> 34:17.922
I hope he doesn't think I'm gonna
join the mile high club with him.

34:23.628 --> 34:25.897
I've never felt
so sexually frustrated.

34:25.963 --> 34:29.067
This girl fancies us
and can't do anything about it.

34:40.344 --> 34:43.014
I'm buzzing.
Aaron doesn't want us to pull,

34:43.080 --> 34:46.583
that must mean he likes us a little
bit. I can't wait for tonight.

34:48.553 --> 34:52.824
The air hostess comes over, perfect
opportunity to find out about Iceland

34:59.797 --> 35:01.599
Are they?
Like you.

35:01.666 --> 35:04.802
So the air hostess comes over
and she's canny decent.

35:04.869 --> 35:08.372
I'd probably join the mile high club
if I wasn't already banned.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.085
Ah, Scott! Oh!

35:21.152 --> 35:22.787
(laughter)

35:22.854 --> 35:26.624
Scott knocked me leg
out of position. (laughter)

35:33.531 --> 35:36.767
Iceland's just full of rubble.
It's just rubble.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.669
It looks like wasteland.

35:46.677 --> 35:48.312
That's where we're staying?

35:50.882 --> 35:55.786
The lads go steaming in like the
first one there wins a free vagina.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.889
(screaming)

35:58.990 --> 36:00.758
That's mine.
This is mine.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.393
This is mine.

36:04.562 --> 36:07.131
The apartment is lush.
The lads will bagsy

36:07.198 --> 36:10.468
the downstairs and hoy the girls
upstairs, out the way.

36:10.535 --> 36:12.336
Iceland, bitches.

36:12.403 --> 36:15.740
(excited screaming)

36:15.806 --> 36:17.642
(all chant) Iceland, Iceland!

36:17.708 --> 36:22.146
Let's get sorted, get ready and see
what the fuck Rezzavik's got to offer

36:22.213 --> 36:23.347
Rezzavik?

36:27.084 --> 36:29.320
What was happening on the plane
with Kyle?

36:29.387 --> 36:32.490
I was talking to him,
tickling his arm, and he was like,

36:32.557 --> 36:36.761
"Stop it, I've got a hard-on."
All this flirting with Kyle,

36:36.827 --> 36:39.497
I can imagine
the sex might happen again.

36:39.564 --> 36:42.600
Nah, like it's nice
to have someone to flirt with.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.735
There's no more to it than that.

36:44.802 --> 36:49.173
Charlotte thinks something's gonna
happen between me and Kyle again.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.642
I'm like, "No, it won't happen."

36:53.678 --> 36:55.413
Yay!

37:01.085 --> 37:04.922
I'm excited to go out. First night
in Iceland, we're going to work,

37:04.989 --> 37:07.191
we're gonna smash it.
Bring it on.

37:10.227 --> 37:12.129
There's loads of fit birds here.

37:12.196 --> 37:15.600
I'll get over the language barrier
by necking on with them all.

37:20.304 --> 37:23.975
This is the perfect situation
to take my mind off Marnie.

37:24.041 --> 37:25.810
Look at all the fit birds.

37:31.115 --> 37:32.850
It's a full-on fanny fest.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.187
I'll never pull Aaron with girls
throwing themselves at him.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.599
I divvent know
if it's the language barrier

37:48.666 --> 37:53.871
or it's me accent, but somewhere
something's got lost in translation.

38:08.052 --> 38:10.655
There's girls on this arm, that arm,
on me neck.

38:10.721 --> 38:13.124
For the first time,
I've got fanny fright.

38:24.335 --> 38:27.972
The girls in Iceland are so full-on
even Gaz is shitting himself.

38:40.885 --> 38:45.790
This is carnage. All these girls
wanna do is get drunk and neck on.

38:47.825 --> 38:51.829
Another night, another girl for Kyle,
but I'm not bothered, I swear.

38:51.896 --> 38:54.165
Do I look bothered?
I'm not bothered!

38:56.667 --> 39:00.504
I've been here ten minutes and a
girl's dragging us to the toilet.

39:06.243 --> 39:08.312
I fucking love Iceland.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.159
Fuck this. Tash On Tours
is an absolute write-off.

39:22.226 --> 39:25.796
It's time to do the one thing
I can definitely do right.

39:28.432 --> 39:29.967
Get obliterated.

39:32.403 --> 39:35.639
(screams)
Icelandic shots, urgh!

39:35.706 --> 39:38.642
They are fucking disgusting.

39:40.077 --> 39:41.679
(screams)

39:44.315 --> 39:48.652
Work's done. Time to hit the club
and show this country how it's done.

39:52.423 --> 39:55.092
We get to the club
and it's no better.

39:55.159 --> 39:58.229
Girls are on one side,
boys are on the other.

39:58.295 --> 40:01.665
We're a family. They're not doing
anything to interact with us.

40:06.637 --> 40:09.807
Now we're in the club,
hopefully there won't just be women.

40:11.809 --> 40:13.277
Hang on. Just women.

40:14.211 --> 40:17.948
Woman... woman... woman!

40:29.393 --> 40:33.330
What the fuck is going on with this
Gaz, Marnie and Aaron love triangle?

40:38.335 --> 40:41.238
If Gary wasn't here,
Marnie would crack on with Aaron,

40:41.305 --> 40:43.607
so what does it matter
that he is here?

40:43.674 --> 40:46.410
Marnie should jump on Aaron's cock,
regardless.

41:00.825 --> 41:03.861
It's so nice to talk
to Charlotte about everything.

41:03.928 --> 41:06.831
She's been there
so she knows what he's like.

41:15.906 --> 41:19.743
This has gotta be the most ridiculous
boy-girl ratio I've ever seen.

41:24.114 --> 41:27.585
I'm fucked. Aaron's pulled.
I fucking hate Iceland.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.556
I am pissed off at the boys.

41:32.623 --> 41:35.726
They've brought 50 million girls in,
we're all squashed

41:35.793 --> 41:38.062
and I've got no room to dance.

41:38.128 --> 41:40.731
I wanna get my fucking groove on.

41:47.037 --> 41:49.039
It must be these Icelandic shots

41:49.106 --> 41:51.709
I'm drinking,
because one minute I'm dancing

41:51.775 --> 41:54.545
and the next I'm reaching
for the nearest bucket.

42:05.656 --> 42:09.326
Us girls have been ignored all
night. Fuck this, we're going home.

42:15.766 --> 42:19.270
Get back to the house and it's
straight to the bedroom.

42:24.441 --> 42:28.946
Tonight's been shit. I thought Kyle
might actually show me some attention

42:29.013 --> 42:31.548
but he's in bed
with another girl, great.

42:37.755 --> 42:41.358
First night in Iceland was mint.
I might even fucking move here.

42:41.425 --> 42:43.160
I'm pissed off there's no ice.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.365
We lost the girls last minute.

42:53.804 --> 42:57.274
The next thing I'm cuddling Aaron,
what the fuck went wrong?

43:02.313 --> 43:04.615
I've had an absolute wicked night.

43:04.682 --> 43:06.850
All I can say is, bring on tomorrow.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.285
Iceland's been unreal.

43:10.321 --> 43:14.058
Go on, Kyle!
It's time to head back to the Toon.

43:14.124 --> 43:17.628
Marnie's telling me that Gary has
broke his own lad code.

43:21.365 --> 43:24.168
I'm starting to realise
that I really fancy Kyle.

43:24.234 --> 43:26.437
Bye-bye, Sassy. Hello, Slutty.

43:26.503 --> 43:29.139
Gaz is hiding something,
if he doesn't confess,

43:29.206 --> 43:30.941
I'm gonna fucking kick off.

43:31.008 --> 43:34.678
He's been banging on about lad code
and he stabs Scott in the back.

43:34.745 --> 43:35.846
What a fucking dick.

43:35.913 --> 43:38.549
I would never do that to you.
(smash!)

44:03.507 --> 44:03.707
.
