00:01.502 --> 00:03.754
<i>Previously on</i> Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.921 --> 00:05.506
<i>How do you create matter from nothing?</i>

00:05.715 --> 00:09.010
No.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.054
- Pure carbon.
- You have to put down the weapon.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.016
What did he do to us?

00:15.307 --> 00:17.309
<i>The blast must have altered
our state somehow.</i>

00:17.685 --> 00:20.813
- Trapped between dimensions?
- These boxes look empty, but they're not.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.773
They harness energy
from multiple dimensions.

00:23.065 --> 00:26.110
The people who constructed these boxes
used a book.

00:26.736 --> 00:30.656
- It's too much for a human mind to bear.
- Perhaps, I could read the book.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.867
<i>I'm building
an inter-dimensional gateway</i>

00:33.117 --> 00:34.744
<i>with an android I've created.</i>

00:37.038 --> 00:38.789
- Robbie?
- Mack got a lead on his uncle,

00:38.873 --> 00:39.832
possible location.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.586
Want to help settle my last score?

01:00.186 --> 01:01.520
Out of my way. I need to see him.

01:01.604 --> 01:03.272
- How many are there?
- How many?

01:06.108 --> 01:08.903
Eli. Eli! We got a problem.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.364
Cops, S.H.I.E.L.D.
They're everywhere, man.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.408
Keep them busy. That's why I pay you.

01:16.952 --> 01:17.912
You guys been paid yet?

01:19.080 --> 01:19.997
I haven't been paid.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.042
You want us to go to war
with S.H.I.E.L.D.?

01:25.544 --> 01:26.504
I don't know, man.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.678
You're right.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.641
A hard day's work deserves
a hard day's pay.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.188
Hope you take diamonds.

01:48.317 --> 01:51.237
They're unrefined, but they're priceless
once properly cut.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.660
Speaking of which,

01:58.369 --> 02:00.704
you may have to cut the rest out
of his lungs.

02:05.084 --> 02:07.378
S.H.I.E.L.D. wants to see
what I'm creating...

02:09.839 --> 02:10.840
I'll show them.

02:12.591 --> 02:13.676
I'll show them all.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.397
We're live in downtown L.A.,

02:26.522 --> 02:28.399
where several city streets
have been blocked off

02:28.524 --> 02:30.860
due to what authorities are calling
a potential threat.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.111
Details are scarce,

02:32.194 --> 02:33.737
but when S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives
on the scene,

02:33.821 --> 02:36.490
it suggests the threat
may be an Inhuman one.

02:36.699 --> 02:38.200
Joining us on the phone right now

02:38.284 --> 02:40.578
is the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. himself,
Jeffrey Mace.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.705
<i>Director Mace,
can you clear up some of the rumours</i>

02:42.830 --> 02:44.248
<i>about what's happening here right now?</i>

02:44.456 --> 02:46.208
Of course, and thanks for taking my call.

02:46.333 --> 02:50.129
The situation is that
there is an escaped fugitive on the loose,

02:50.296 --> 02:52.882
and S.H.I.E.L.D. is assisting LAPD
with the hunt.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.050
<i>Is the fugitive you're referring to Quake?</i>

02:55.217 --> 02:57.928
<i>There have been reports
of seismic activity in the area.</i>

02:58.053 --> 03:00.681
No, I can assure you the threat
is not Quake,

03:00.764 --> 03:01.891
and it is not Inhuman.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.560
<i>Then why the evacuation?
Why is S.H.I.E.L.D. involved?</i>

03:04.643 --> 03:07.479
You know, it's still an active scene,
so I'm afraid I can't comment.

03:07.563 --> 03:11.609
But, uh, once the situation resolves,
we'll hold a full press conference.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.944
Hey, thanks for your time.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.654
It's like a circus out there.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.574
- And that picture of me on the banner--
- Agreed. Not your best side.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.159
I'll schedule a reshoot for this week.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.496
Burrows. Give us the room.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.918
How many people do we think Morrow
has in there?

03:29.501 --> 03:30.461
A small army.

03:30.628 --> 03:32.087
Leftovers from a Chinatown gang

03:32.213 --> 03:34.298
and some ex-cons he recruited while he was
in prison.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.133
- We need to move in.
- Press is everywhere on this.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.844
We can't afford to be seen working
with Daisy or Reyes.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.221
I mean he's a vigilante killer.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.181
It's a little more complicated than that,
but yes.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.475
He's also nearly unstoppable,
and he's on our side.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.769
- And what happens when he's not?
- Then we deal with him.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.646
But right now, the reality is this,

03:49.146 --> 03:51.523
Eli Morrow just wiped out
an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. Tac Team

03:51.607 --> 03:54.485
with a few shards of carbon
that he created out of thin air.

03:54.652 --> 03:55.903
And that's just what we've seen.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.154
What else is he capable of?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.656
We need the big guns on this one,

03:58.781 --> 04:01.200
and Yo-Yo, Daisy, and Reyes
are the biggest guns we have.

04:02.493 --> 04:05.329
What about the science team?
And I'm talking about Aida, specifically.

04:05.663 --> 04:08.082
I mean, she did, after all,
bring you and Agent Fitz back from...

04:08.540 --> 04:09.959
well, wherever the hell you were.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.545
If a similar technology is in play,
she could have a solve.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.175
- What? You disagree?
- I don't, actually.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.678
- But?
- All cards on the table?

04:23.347 --> 04:24.431
Aida's an android.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.601
She's-- W-- what did you just say?

04:28.102 --> 04:30.104
- An android.
- Had me fooled, too.

04:31.814 --> 04:32.690
But that's...

04:34.275 --> 04:36.610
Okay.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.697
I mean, forget about the fact
that I was mildly attracted to her.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.740
That totally goes against
the Sokovia Accords.

04:41.824 --> 04:43.033
Doesn't anyone remember Ultron?

04:46.370 --> 04:49.665
- Was this Radcliffe's doing?
- Sir, we really don't have much time.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.750
The point is, a good director

04:51.834 --> 04:54.128
needs to know what assets he has
at his disposal,

04:54.336 --> 04:56.755
and in this case,
I think Aida could be an asset.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.508
A risky one, but, it's your call.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.555
Agent May, go to Dr Radcliffe's lab
and get Aida.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.848
I want her on this mission.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.808
We'll dismantle her afterwards.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.394
What about my assault team?

05:13.188 --> 05:15.316
You got the green light. But, Coulson...

05:16.608 --> 05:17.568
keep Daisy out of sight.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.827
Bold move, telling him about Aida.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.621
- It was a strategic play.
- Felt like poking the bear?

05:30.164 --> 05:32.708
More like feeding the bear.
I'm hoping if I give him something,

05:32.791 --> 05:35.753
- maybe he'll give me something
- Like Senator Nadeer.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.547
I want to know what his deal is with her.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.883
She hates Inhumans, hates S.H.I.E.L.D.,

05:41.050 --> 05:43.552
yet he sends Simmons off to examine
a new Inhuman for her.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.304
- I don't like it.
- Tough, isn't it,

05:45.637 --> 05:47.264
not to be the keeper of all the secrets?

05:47.473 --> 05:50.309
It's not about that.
I just want to know whose side he's on.

05:50.476 --> 05:54.021
The only side he's ever been on,
his own.

05:54.355 --> 05:58.317
You're right. Mace is a political animal.
There's got to be something in it for him.

05:58.650 --> 05:59.943
Good luck figuring that out.

06:00.652 --> 06:03.572
Meanwhile, I'll be playing chauffeur
to a robot.

06:04.239 --> 06:07.618
Sorry. Didn't think you'd get stuck
on a milk run to Radcliffe's.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.370
We're gonna miss you in the field.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.956
I'll catch up.
Can't let you have all the fun.

06:14.458 --> 06:18.003
When this is over, it's time.
We are cracking that bottle.

06:18.796 --> 06:22.508
- You don't have to twist my arm.
- I wouldn't dare. You might whip my ass.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.144
<i>Just finished a scan
of the building.</i>

06:34.228 --> 06:35.562
<i>I'm uploading signatures now.</i>

06:35.854 --> 06:36.772
Copy that.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.817
Yo, I'm not wearing a mask, man.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.778
It's not a mask. It's a balaclava.

06:43.362 --> 06:47.157
- Thought that was a dessert.
- What? No, ma-- Never mind.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.537
Director just wants you to keep
a low profile.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.330
There's a lot of media out here.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.208
- I don't answer to him.
- No, you don't.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.669
The guy you answer to
is a lot more unforgiving.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.964
Yeah, well, you know a little something
about that now, don't you?

07:04.550 --> 07:07.511
Well, hopefully, when all this is over,
he won't be anybody's boss anymore.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.638
Amen to that, brother.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.894
- All good?
- Yeah.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.023
Robbie's on his way to Daisy,
and, uh, Yo-Yo's already with her.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.734
Agent Simmons,
the gang's all here and in position.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.111
<i>Copy that, Agent Coulson.</i>

07:24.695 --> 07:26.321
Fitz, do we have thermals
off the satellite?

07:26.405 --> 07:28.282
Morrow's men retreated inside
a few minutes ago.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.118
- All of them?
- Yeah. Strange.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.330
Zephyr to Assault Team, be aware that
all Morrow's men have pulled back.

07:35.456 --> 07:36.665
You need to be ready for anything.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.625
Shards of carbon out of thin air...

07:39.710 --> 07:41.587
it's not possible.
You can't create something out of nothing.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.630
- First law of thermodynamics.
- Exactly.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.717
Even in the realm of quantum vacuum
fluctuations, there are still laws.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.929
- So, how's he doing it?
- Maybe it's magic.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.683
I do not like magic. Or clowns.

07:56.018 --> 07:58.270
Or clowns with knives in the dark.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.820
- Reading another earthquake, one four.
- For the record, it wasn't me.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.405
<i>Yeah, well, all the same, Daisy,</i>

08:08.489 --> 08:10.199
<i>I'd like to look at the new gauntlets
after the mission.</i>

08:10.282 --> 08:12.868
- Check that they're calibrated correctly.
<i>- They are, trust me.</i>

08:12.993 --> 08:15.037
The effect on my bones is a tenth
of what it was.

08:15.204 --> 08:16.371
Here comes Burning Man.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.081
Any life on your side?

08:19.041 --> 08:19.958
No.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.711
- You sure Eli's in there?
<i>- Let's find out.</i>

08:22.794 --> 08:25.964
<i>- Assault Team, you have a go.</i>
- Copy. Breaching now.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.265
Looks all clear to me...

08:37.267 --> 08:38.268
which means it isn't.

08:38.602 --> 08:41.563
I hear something, water running.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.066
Can you do a little recon up ahead?

08:44.274 --> 08:47.736
Well, that depends.
If "recon" means "look around", sure.

09:31.947 --> 09:32.990
Yo-Yo!

09:39.413 --> 09:40.872
You like playin' with fire, Eli?

09:41.915 --> 09:42.833
Let's play.

09:53.385 --> 09:57.931
Director-- Sir, if I may explain,
I wasn't trying to fool anyone.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.392
But you did. Aida fooled everyone.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.979
She's quite amazing, Doctor.
Totally lifelike.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.107
Well, the LMD program was designed
to save lives,

10:07.232 --> 10:09.651
the lives of-- of-- of agents
in the field,

10:09.735 --> 10:12.237
- of the Director.
- Oh, I understand the allure.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.198
An android like Aida could be used
as a soldier,

10:15.324 --> 10:18.577
- a spy, a decoy.
- Or a chef, if you like.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.707
Sir... I realise how this must look.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.251
Genius scientist with a questionable past

10:26.376 --> 10:28.920
forgetting to ask
for the proper clearances,

10:29.004 --> 10:32.799
et cetera, et cetera. But I assure you,
all of my data is yours.

10:32.924 --> 10:33.967
I'm an open book.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.095
Mm. Book. Right.

10:39.556 --> 10:44.144
That Arch-gateway thing that saved
the team on their last mission,

10:44.603 --> 10:48.315
- Aida designed and built it, yes?
- Which proves how valuable she can be.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.276
Mm. Is this what showed her
how to build it?

10:55.364 --> 10:58.033
The book... helped, yes.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.703
I want to know more about it.

11:02.663 --> 11:08.293
Well, all I know is,
it's a very powerful piece of technology.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.338
It's like a-- like a tablet that can read
your mind.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.633
Very intimidating, frankly,
which is why we had Aida read it.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.051
It's a good job we did.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.638
Otherwise, Agents Coulson
and Fitz would have been lost

11:19.721 --> 11:21.723
in the dimensional vacuum of space-time.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.061
So, the book intimidates you,
but Aida doesn't intimidate you?

11:26.228 --> 11:27.187
No, not at all.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.065
Why? What are your plans for her?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.192
- Well, that depends.
- On?

11:33.151 --> 11:34.027
Her next mission.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.156
We need to get you up to the Zephyr
so Simmons can check you out.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.158
I'm fine. We have a job to do.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.036
Thanks.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.290
I'm just trying to help you out.
Why you being so cold?

11:47.457 --> 11:50.085
I'm not being cold.
I just got hit by a giant fireball,

11:50.168 --> 11:52.879
I lost my favourite jacket,
and you're treating me like a <i>niña.</i>

11:56.508 --> 11:58.969
- You okay?
- Better than them, apparently.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.221
- Anything on Robbie?
- No.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.391
His camera's all glitchy.
The feed keeps cutting in and out.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.393
Going through the fire
probably didn't help.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.645
Oh. Hang on. We got something.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.611
Is this thing on? Anyone seeing this?

12:17.446 --> 12:18.321
We do.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.097
What the...

12:52.189 --> 12:55.776
Looks like the power cells
from Momentum Labs, except economy-sized.

12:56.026 --> 12:59.362
Morrow has created a giant battery
for himself, filled with quantum energy.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.406
Well, not "created", exactly.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.623
- No, no, no! Don't go in there!
- Robbie?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.542
His comms must be fried.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.340
What the hell is that?

13:19.132 --> 13:22.385
- What's that object on the wall?
- Hope it's not cesium again.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.763
Cesium? Is that what ignited
the entry hall?

13:25.597 --> 13:28.183
Based on the spectral analysis
of Yo-Yo's jacket, yeah.

13:28.934 --> 13:29.935
It's highly unstable.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.562
And pyrophoric, yeah.
Reacts on contact with water.

13:32.938 --> 13:36.358
First carbon, now cesium. It's like Morrow
is testing his abilities,

13:36.483 --> 13:39.528
making his way through the periodic table.
Who knows what other traps he's set?

13:39.903 --> 13:40.946
I do.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.616
I've seen that setup before.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.121
Don't touch that.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.090
- Eli.
- You don't belong here, Robbie.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.052
Go home. Please.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.179
I will...

14:07.639 --> 14:08.765
once you're dead.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.952
- What the hell just happened?
- Robbie's down.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.328
- I'm going in.
- Daisy, wait.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.792
You realise we're trying to hide you
from the press, right?

14:35.917 --> 14:38.003
A, I don't care. B, that wasn't me.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.922
<i>Um. Guys, the problem is bigger
than you think.</i>

14:41.256 --> 14:43.466
There's something in that building
everyone needs to see.

14:45.969 --> 14:49.306
- The demon core? Seriously?
- You cannot make this stuff up.

14:49.598 --> 14:52.100
I didn't name it that. The physicists
at Los Alamos did.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.853
This is the last image before Robbie's
feed cut out.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.565
They do look awfully similar,
whatever they are.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.108
- It's a fail-safe.
- It's a fuel source.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.862
Well, it's both, powering not just
the cell, but Eli himself.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.655
But it's also
the perfect insurance policy

15:05.739 --> 15:08.158
- to keep us all at bay.
- Now-- Now, when you say "fail-safe"...

15:08.992 --> 15:11.703
See this beryllium lid?
It's a neutron reflector

15:12.203 --> 15:13.788
rigged to drop at the touch of a finger.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.875
If that lid drops into place,
it would trigger supercritical mass.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.794
Time-out. Fail-safe, supercritical mass.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.005
Are you guys talking about what I think
you're talking about?

15:22.213 --> 15:23.965
Eli's made his way through
the periodic table,

15:24.090 --> 15:27.510
- all the way to plutonium.
- Uh, and if Matchstick messes with it?

15:30.305 --> 15:31.348
Time for plan B.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.271
Anyone? Feel free to chime in.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.824
Guess I'm not the only one with a secret.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.035
Between the radioactive plutonium

15:52.118 --> 15:55.246
and the quantum energy fields
bombarding you and the carbon spike,

15:55.747 --> 15:58.667
a normal person would have been dead
ten times over, but...

16:00.001 --> 16:01.336
I guess you're not normal, are you?

16:01.878 --> 16:02.837
Come closer.

16:04.339 --> 16:07.509
- I'll show you what I am.
- I heard stories in prison.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.220
Whispers of a demon...

16:11.304 --> 16:12.305
Ghost Rider.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.351
My own nephew?

16:18.061 --> 16:19.813
- How?
- It was 'cause of you.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.566
The night of the drive-by...

16:25.068 --> 16:26.486
they were trying to kill you...

16:27.946 --> 16:28.989
for things you've done.

16:29.114 --> 16:33.159
No, it was the Bauers, Joe and Lucy.
They started this! They lied.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.578
You think I give a rat's ass
about any of that?

16:36.079 --> 16:38.581
A bunch of scientists fighting over
some stupid book?

16:39.165 --> 16:41.793
All the killing, the bodies...

16:43.169 --> 16:44.587
the lives destroyed.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.215
I never meant for any of this to happen,
Robbie.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.386
- I never wanted to hurt you.
- We trusted you, <i>Tío...</i>

16:53.346 --> 16:54.222
Gabe and me.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.644
We loved you like a father...

17:02.188 --> 17:03.565
and you tore it all apart.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.026
I know.

17:08.737 --> 17:09.612
Why?

17:12.198 --> 17:13.157
Why'd you do it...

17:14.742 --> 17:15.785
become a killer?

17:17.787 --> 17:20.707
- Well, I guess it runs in the family.
- You had a Ph.D.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.252
You had us.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.838
- You had a good job.
- A good job?

17:27.714 --> 17:30.300
Those <i>gueros</i> at Momentum thought
they were doing me a favour.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.762
They looked at me like they were better,
like they were smarter.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.640
The condescension in their eyes...

17:39.851 --> 17:41.061
They got what they deserved.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.816
- You had to get vengeance.
- Not vengeance...

17:48.318 --> 17:49.486
respect!

17:49.986 --> 17:54.240
You have no idea how hard I worked
every day of my life.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.535
To claw my way,
just to get in that damn door.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.164
Sure, I made mistakes, like any kid.
And I paid for them.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.540
But it didn't matter.

18:03.374 --> 18:06.753
From high school to grad school,
no one believed in me!

18:07.670 --> 18:11.382
They thought I was cheating.
They thought I wasn't capable!

18:12.509 --> 18:13.510
Shut me out.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.763
Well, guess what--
guess what I'm capable of now.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.933
I can create a city out of nothing...

18:21.351 --> 18:23.686
or I can cover it in volcanic rock.

18:25.021 --> 18:25.897
Robbie...

18:27.148 --> 18:29.109
I am becoming a god.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.113
You better be.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.201
Because the devil is coming for you.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.553
Remember I gave you a chance to leave.

18:59.514 --> 19:00.765
Whatever happens next...

19:02.267 --> 19:03.184
it's on you.

19:16.239 --> 19:19.993
Agent Coulson, I took the liberty
of bringing Dr Radcliffe up to speed.

19:20.201 --> 19:23.538
Yes, quantum cells, flaming skulls,
androids,

19:23.621 --> 19:24.914
it's just another day at S.H.I.E.L.D.,
huh?

19:25.248 --> 19:27.500
- What's all this?
- Components from the transdimensional arch

19:27.584 --> 19:29.794
and the neodymium core
from an EMP generator.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.671
Aida thought they could be quite useful.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.465
- Aida thinks?
- Maybe about electric sheep.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.093
I take it that was a joke and does not
require a response.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.094
Mm.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.806
- Nice to see you made it.
- Just following orders.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.433
Need all hands on deck on this one.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.645
Still, Director, you didn't need to come
all this way.

19:47.770 --> 19:50.315
And miss the opportunity of seeing
a nuclear weapon up close?

19:50.607 --> 19:52.442
- Not a chance.
- How close do you mean?

19:53.276 --> 19:56.154
I think it's time the public sees
the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. in action.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.281
Walk with me, Phil.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.366
I've got a plan.

20:04.537 --> 20:08.041
Absorption plates, frequency mounts,
resonant processor units...

20:09.125 --> 20:10.418
Results don't lie. They're perfect.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.170
They might be a little snug,

20:12.253 --> 20:14.422
but they've got me close to full strength,
so...

20:15.506 --> 20:16.424
thank you.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.009
You're welcome.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.969
Hey, the good news is, you're definitely

20:20.053 --> 20:21.888
not responsible for the seismic activity
in the area.

20:22.013 --> 20:25.600
- As I've said, repeatedly.
- Yeah, but now it's really true.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.062
Ah, the arch.
I take it Aida's arrived?

20:29.395 --> 20:32.023
Don't look so excited, but yes.
She's here,

20:32.232 --> 20:35.151
along with Dr Radcliffe
and Director Mace.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.362
Oh, well, then, the day
is officially saved.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.197
No love for your new Director?

20:39.364 --> 20:40.615
- He's a lying weasel.
- We don't trust him.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.243
Really? What'd he do?

20:44.452 --> 20:47.038
All due respect, sir,
that's the most ridiculous idea

20:47.121 --> 20:48.831
I've heard all day,
and it's been a long day.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.334
I understand your concern,
but I'll be right there in the mix.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.294
You want to send Yo-Yo back
into that building

20:53.419 --> 20:54.754
to grab a hunk of plutonium,

20:54.963 --> 20:58.758
- an unstable, radioactive substance.
- We'll put her in a hazmat suit.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.301
Not sure they're built for running.

21:00.385 --> 21:01.594
She's in no condition to go back

21:01.678 --> 21:02.637
- into the field.
- I'm right here,

21:02.720 --> 21:04.138
and I can speak for myself.

21:04.806 --> 21:05.765
My condition is fine.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.976
You're not fine.
There's got to be a better plan.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.103
It's not your decision, Agent Mackenzie.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.146
We gotta get that bomb
out of Morrow's possession.

21:12.272 --> 21:15.191
Sir, maybe you should stick to optics
and let someone else handle tactics.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.317
Mack.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.863
Director... can I talk to you
for a minute?

21:25.076 --> 21:25.952
Elena...

21:27.495 --> 21:28.913
please, I'm trying to protect you.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.418
So it's "Elena" now, is it?

21:33.793 --> 21:35.795
Where has that been
for the past three months?

21:36.045 --> 21:36.921
Come on.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.633
You know how I feel about you.

21:41.759 --> 21:45.263
Well, if you bothered to take the time,
you would realise I have many gifts.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.932
But reading minds is not one of them.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.938
- So, where is this Inhuman being held?
- I have no idea.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.274
The Director literally made me put a bag
over my head,

21:56.357 --> 21:58.318
- had me whisked away.
- It's kidnapping.

21:58.693 --> 21:59.777
And he lied to everyone about it.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.654
And if the Director's involved
with Senator Nadeer,

22:01.738 --> 22:03.156
there's no telling
what they've got planned.

22:03.281 --> 22:05.783
It just doesn't make any sense.
Director Mace is an Inhuman,

22:05.867 --> 22:07.994
and all that senator does
is spew hate about us.

22:12.790 --> 22:13.750
What's wrong?

22:15.543 --> 22:19.839
Uh... I feel a quake coming.
Is that even possible?

22:21.758 --> 22:24.093
The gauntlets can absorb a wide range
of infrasonic waves.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.095
Better to shield your bones
from further damage.

22:26.220 --> 22:28.264
Impressive you can feel it
all the way up here.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.850
The epicentre's right where Eli
set up shop.

22:30.975 --> 22:31.893
That can't be a coincidence.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.770
Something he created in there
is the cause,

22:33.853 --> 22:34.937
whether it's the power cell or--

22:35.021 --> 22:36.898
- No, he's not creating anything.
- Here we go again.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.942
There's an order to things in this
seemingly chaotic universe.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.277
There are laws, okay?

22:41.361 --> 22:43.863
And one of those laws says that every
speck of matter

22:44.072 --> 22:46.449
that makes up every animal, vegetable,
mineral,

22:46.908 --> 22:48.242
no matter how much it changes,

22:48.951 --> 22:51.079
it comes from somewhere,
belongs somewhere.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.705
Its natural state...

22:55.750 --> 22:58.044
- its home.
- It's kind of a lovely sentiment,

22:58.336 --> 23:00.463
even if it was completely unintentional.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.215
So, what's the cause of the quake?

23:05.510 --> 23:06.511
Grand larceny.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.221
You're losing them, Jeffrey.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.807
Yeah, well, maybe if you backed me up
once in a while,

23:10.890 --> 23:12.725
- I wouldn't be.
- I won't back a bad plan.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.520
Or any plan that's not yours
or part of your agenda.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.188
- What agenda?
- Oh, come on, Phil.

23:17.271 --> 23:19.524
Make up your mind.
You want to be Director or not?

23:19.732 --> 23:22.527
'Cause I'm not some meat puppet who's just
gonna smile and roll over on command.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.987
No one's asking you to roll over,
but you do have a nice smile.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.949
You stepped down from this job,
yet ever since I took over,

23:28.032 --> 23:30.827
you've been running around on this plane,
doing what you want, whenever you want.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.286
You mean saving lives, that kind of thing?

23:32.370 --> 23:35.456
I mean using fugitives and killers
to do your dirty work,

23:35.706 --> 23:38.292
building robots, keeping secrets from me?

23:38.376 --> 23:40.753
You want to talk about secrets?
Fine. Let's do it.

23:40.962 --> 23:43.339
Let's start with the secret plan you cut
with Senator Nadeer.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.511
- Who told you about that?
- A ghost.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.140
Did you know she has
an Inhuman prisoner locked away,

23:52.223 --> 23:56.060
- like some sort of lab experiment?
- What's that phrase about glass houses?

23:57.854 --> 23:58.896
You're an Inhuman.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.732
Why would you want to work with someone
who hates us so much?

24:01.983 --> 24:02.984
You want to know why?

24:03.985 --> 24:05.111
Take a look in the mirror.

24:05.903 --> 24:09.824
Senator Nadeer has photos of you
in the prison with Reyes

24:09.907 --> 24:12.994
and that dead gangster he left behind,
Santino Noguera.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.079
And she was gonna go public.

24:15.872 --> 24:17.457
Can you imagine the press?

24:17.790 --> 24:18.833
"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.961
working with domestic terrorists
and murderers".

24:23.796 --> 24:25.298
You were trying to protect S.H.I.E.L.D.

24:26.424 --> 24:27.800
That's the job I was hired to do.

24:29.427 --> 24:32.305
Did I let Agent Simmons go examine
an Inhuman? Yeah.

24:33.306 --> 24:36.225
Did I want to know more about him?
Absolutely.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.853
But I didn't have that option at the time.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.980
Why the hell didn't you just come to me
in the first place?

24:41.105 --> 24:42.356
Now, why would I do that?

24:42.565 --> 24:45.359
In case you haven't noticed, Phil,
we're not a team that trusts.

24:49.447 --> 24:50.615
We're not a team at all.

24:58.539 --> 24:59.499
Maybe you're right.

25:00.583 --> 25:03.252
But we damn well better become one
if we're gonna stop Eli Morrow

25:03.336 --> 25:05.171
from blowing up half of Los Angeles.

25:06.923 --> 25:09.175
Oh, that. Right. Fitz figured that out.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.652
See this? This is water.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.988
Wow. I'm so impressed.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.742
Yeah, I forgot,
you weren't very good at science.

25:34.909 --> 25:37.870
You see, water's not a base element,
it's a compound.

25:39.247 --> 25:40.581
Not just any compound...

25:42.124 --> 25:44.252
it's the next step in the evolution
of my power...

25:45.962 --> 25:46.963
creating life.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.216
You know, you might want
to get a girlfriend first.

25:54.512 --> 25:57.682
Sorry to be the one to break it to you,
Eli, but you're not a god.

25:58.724 --> 26:01.727
Turns out, you're still just
a petty thief.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.902
- We found him outside.
- No gun on him, just this.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.240
Agent Coulson...

26:15.783 --> 26:17.743
- you should be dead.
- I get that a lot.

26:18.703 --> 26:19.745
Never gets old, though.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.539
- Means I'm still here.
- How?

26:22.373 --> 26:25.835
- I watched you get vaporised.
- Just the fact that you're asking, "how",

26:26.168 --> 26:28.212
shows how little you know
about what happened

26:28.713 --> 26:29.714
or what's about to.

26:29.839 --> 26:32.049
I'm not sure if that's an insult
or a threat.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.803
Either way... not a good idea.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.808
Ah!

26:42.059 --> 26:43.686
Should be the last of them.
How are we doing?

26:43.894 --> 26:45.646
We're close.
The core should be placed here,

26:45.730 --> 26:47.023
directly underneath the cell.

26:47.398 --> 26:50.776
- Time for you to work your magic, my dear.
- I don't perform magic, Doctor.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.111
Magic involves deception.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.614
Yeah, I just meant it's time
to start connecting the power cells.

26:54.697 --> 26:56.824
I really need to update your cache
of common vernacular.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.451
You really think the magnet's
gonna be strong enough

26:58.534 --> 27:01.495
- to hold him down?
- The neodymium core is no ordinary magnet.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.957
It enabled the Watchdogs' EMP device
to knock out the power in several cities.

27:05.374 --> 27:08.544
I can't believe she's a robot.
She's so lifelike.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.921
Thank you. I'm learning.

27:12.006 --> 27:14.550
What Aida neglected to add
was that the core is useless

27:14.634 --> 27:16.260
unless we get the other half
properly placed

27:16.344 --> 27:18.429
and we manage to get the rest of the gate
up in time.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.057
Yeah, we will... barring an earthquake.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.100
Leave those to me, okay?

27:23.184 --> 27:25.728
Everyone leaves like we came,
in one piece.

27:27.021 --> 27:29.190
Robbie, can you hear me?

27:32.985 --> 27:34.612
How could you do that to your own nephew?

27:35.363 --> 27:38.741
You know he's more than that,
what he's capable of.

27:39.367 --> 27:40.576
I'm still standing, Coulson.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.579
Oh, but it's like when we were
in the other place,

27:43.829 --> 27:45.122
something's pulling at me.

27:46.415 --> 27:47.416
He's dying in there.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.335
We need to get him out.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.545
What does he mean, "other place"?

27:51.796 --> 27:53.714
You ever heard of the law of conservation
of mass?

27:53.881 --> 27:56.467
Of course, I have.
I have a damn Ph.D. in Engineering.

27:56.676 --> 27:57.927
Oh, right. Sorry.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.429
Then you know matter can't be created
or destroyed.

28:00.805 --> 28:04.642
Except I've proven it's not true.
I'm rewriting the laws of nature.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.645
Yeah, but you're drunk on power
or drinking your own Kool-Aid

28:07.728 --> 28:09.480
or drunk on Powerade-- I don't know.

28:09.647 --> 28:13.818
The point is, you're not creating energy,
Eli, you're stealing it.

28:14.318 --> 28:16.070
Stealing it? From where?

28:16.362 --> 28:19.281
Remember when you thought I was dead?
I was actually right in front of you,

28:19.490 --> 28:22.118
trapped between dimensions.
Ask Robbie. He was there.

28:22.535 --> 28:23.452
It's true.

28:24.495 --> 28:27.081
Right now, Robbie's feeling the pull
from that other place

28:27.164 --> 28:29.458
because he's trapped in a box with a bunch
of quantum energy

28:29.583 --> 28:32.420
that doesn't belong here,
and it sure as hell doesn't belong to you.

28:32.670 --> 28:33.796
Thus, thief.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.006
- You're lying.
- No. It gets worse.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.510
Every time you steal quantum energy,
it causes a seismic rift.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.096
The more you take, the bigger the quake,

28:42.221 --> 28:44.807
which causes a problem,
'cause, you know, plutonium.

28:45.141 --> 28:46.517
Listen to him, <i>Tío.</i>

28:48.310 --> 28:50.020
You don't want to drag them down with you.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.235
Do you know how hard I had to work
to get here,

28:56.610 --> 28:58.487
to achieve what I've achieved?

28:59.363 --> 29:00.614
And you call me a thief...

29:01.741 --> 29:02.616
a fraud?

29:06.370 --> 29:07.955
Careful, Aida.
Our lives depend on this.

29:08.456 --> 29:10.374
- Yours in particular.
- They're getting stronger.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.169
It's like riding a choppy wave.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.670
Did you get the other magnet
to Yo-Yo?

29:14.754 --> 29:16.046
Yes. She's got it.

29:19.175 --> 29:22.386
- We can't handle another tremor like that.
- If that beryllium lid drops into place,

29:22.470 --> 29:24.555
- the plutonium goes nuclear.
- That's not helping, Simmons.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.640
I'm-- I'm absorbing the quakes
as best I can.

29:26.724 --> 29:28.058
How much
can those gauntlets take?

29:34.815 --> 29:36.442
It's not the gauntlets I'm worried about.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.824
Eli, wake up.
Don't you see what's happening?

29:43.949 --> 29:45.785
Don't let your ego blind you to the truth.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.829
What you call truth, Agent Coulson,
I call theory.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.749
That bomb goes off, everyone dies,
you included.

29:51.957 --> 29:52.917
You're wrong!

29:54.460 --> 29:56.045
The Darkhold has shown me the way.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.049
I can create life, even after death.

30:01.801 --> 30:04.011
Can a petty thief do that, huh?

30:06.138 --> 30:07.890
That bomb isn't a fail-safe, is it?

30:08.933 --> 30:10.017
It's your end game.

30:10.935 --> 30:13.687
It's not my end... it's yours.

30:19.068 --> 30:20.486
Uh, guys?

30:21.695 --> 30:22.571
We gotta go.

30:25.825 --> 30:26.700
Almost there.

30:32.623 --> 30:33.916
Come on.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.836
Robbie, I need you to fight.
Get out of that box.

30:38.712 --> 30:40.589
We had a deal.

30:41.590 --> 30:42.883
Well, let's finish it.

30:49.849 --> 30:52.101
All teams... go hot.

32:02.588 --> 32:05.716
It's too strong!

32:10.137 --> 32:11.388
Hey, Daisy.

32:12.389 --> 32:13.307
Hey!

32:23.609 --> 32:24.526
Robbie!

33:27.256 --> 33:29.341
It's all right, Agent Simmons.
I won't bleed out.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.510
The synthetic blood is mostly
for appearances.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.430
But you're in pain. I don't understand.

33:34.722 --> 33:36.890
Dr Radcliffe programmed me to be a decoy.

33:36.974 --> 33:39.476
I need to exhibit the proper response
to human sensations...

33:40.436 --> 33:42.896
- and I was programmed to feel them.
- Including pain.

33:43.105 --> 33:45.566
Yes. It's quite awful.

33:45.983 --> 33:47.192
I'm so sorry, Aida.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.947
I got to get outside.

33:52.281 --> 33:54.533
- It's too much. I got to get out.
- Daisy.

34:15.846 --> 34:16.847
Is that Quake?

34:20.391 --> 34:22.686
Wait, wait. Have you been here
this whole time?

34:27.483 --> 34:30.402
Calm down. Quiet, please.

34:31.862 --> 34:32.780
Please.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.658
You're right, I lied to you.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.453
Quake was here the entire time.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.206
But she was not responsible for the danger
here today.

34:44.291 --> 34:45.292
Agent Johnson...

34:47.503 --> 34:48.587
saved us all.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.466
Just go with it. You'll thank me later.

35:11.944 --> 35:13.487
We need to get this to Gabe.

35:16.323 --> 35:17.533
Belongs to him now.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.953
I wouldn't count out the previous owner
just yet.

35:21.829 --> 35:23.247
You think Robbie will make it back?

35:24.081 --> 35:25.374
The last Ghost Rider did.

35:26.375 --> 35:29.169
- Wait a minute. Wait. What?
- Long story. Regardless...

35:30.254 --> 35:31.964
I don't think we've seen the last
of Mr Reyes.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.467
Everyone's in the common room...

35:36.552 --> 35:37.469
if you want to join us.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.764
I think I already did.

35:44.393 --> 35:47.062
I'm sorry the Director put you on the spot
like that in front of the press.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.272
He called an audible on me.

35:48.856 --> 35:49.898
He can do that, huh?

35:51.525 --> 35:52.484
What I'm saying is...

35:53.360 --> 35:56.488
if you don't want to be an agent again,
we can work something out.

35:59.283 --> 36:00.367
Got to be honest, I...

36:01.368 --> 36:04.830
I don't know how I feel about
being back,

36:05.080 --> 36:08.083
the rules... regulations. But...

36:10.294 --> 36:12.629
there were a few things I've missed.

36:15.257 --> 36:16.258
They missed you, too.

36:19.344 --> 36:22.264
Plus, it doesn't hurt that the new face
of S.H.I.E.L.D. is an Inhuman.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.099
Your idea?

36:25.017 --> 36:27.352
I thought the new face of S.H.I.E.L.D.
should be an Inhuman...

36:28.228 --> 36:29.438
didn't mean him, though.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.445
Yeah, right.

36:37.404 --> 36:39.114
Maybe in the comic book version.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.881
Hey. Where you going?
I was just gonna grab you a beer.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.759
- Not thirsty.
- Look...

37:00.719 --> 37:02.596
I know you're leaving 'cause of me,
and I wish you wouldn't.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.890
- Why?
- Why?

37:05.599 --> 37:06.850
Well, it's because...

37:10.520 --> 37:11.813
I recently, uh...

37:15.734 --> 37:17.069
I went to a bad place...

37:19.363 --> 37:20.989
in my head, I mean, and, uh...

37:22.282 --> 37:23.325
I wanted to talk.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.163
Unless you're saying that
we're not friends anymore.

37:28.372 --> 37:29.539
Friends?

37:30.290 --> 37:33.543
Is that what we are?
I can't figure you out, Turtleman.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.921
We flirt, we talk on the phone,
we go to dinner,

37:36.004 --> 37:38.006
and then nothing... for weeks.

37:39.049 --> 37:42.302
And now you say you're worried about me,
you want to protect me.

37:52.354 --> 37:55.023
Don't call me "Turtleman".

38:08.245 --> 38:09.621
<i>And according to Director Mace,</i>

38:09.746 --> 38:11.915
<i>Quake was never actually a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.,</i>

38:12.165 --> 38:14.960
<i>she was working on
an extended undercover operation</i>

38:15.085 --> 38:17.921
<i>to take down the anti-Inhuman group
the Watchdogs.</i>

38:18.213 --> 38:19.089
<i>More details to come</i>

38:19.172 --> 38:21.383
<i>in an official press conference
later this week.</i>

38:21.675 --> 38:23.885
Sounds like Senator Nadeer
lost her trump card.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.305
She'll be after us, harder than ever.

38:26.513 --> 38:30.809
- We've faced worse than politicians.
- Well, now that we're all gathered,

38:30.976 --> 38:33.520
I'd like to present Agent Johnson
with something.

38:33.603 --> 38:36.231
- Uh...
- Your official lanyard.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.277
It's just a shame Agent Koenig
couldn't be here.

38:40.902 --> 38:41.820
Level blue.

38:42.779 --> 38:45.198
- Thrilling, isn't it?
- What does that mean?

38:46.116 --> 38:47.284
We have no idea.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.747
<i>So, Officer, were you surprised
to see Quake</i>

38:51.913 --> 38:53.665
<i>- drop out of the sky?</i>
- That's a good bunch over there.

38:53.790 --> 38:54.666
Mm.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.418
They came through with flying colours,
didn't they?

38:57.294 --> 38:58.920
Including you and Aida.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.591
Enough to earn her a reprieve?

39:04.426 --> 39:08.430
- Enough to keep your program alive.
- Well, thank you, sir, truly.

39:08.513 --> 39:09.848
You, uh, you won't be disappointed.

39:09.931 --> 39:14.186
Before you thank me, you should know
that I've asked Agent Nathanson

39:14.269 --> 39:17.522
to accompany Aida back to your lab
to help patch her up

39:18.273 --> 39:20.400
and to retrieve all of your research.

39:22.402 --> 39:23.528
From now on, Doctor,

39:23.904 --> 39:26.948
all your work on the LMD program
will take place here,

39:27.532 --> 39:30.619
- under S.H.I.E.L.D. supervision.
- That's wonderful.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.629
No, sir. Don't let me keep you
from the festivities.

39:40.921 --> 39:42.047
I should be done shortly.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.719
Is a team that triumphs. Yes, Director.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.029
Huh.

40:12.702 --> 40:14.246
Oh, my God. What the...

40:14.996 --> 40:16.331
- Hello, Agent Nathanson.
- What?

40:17.040 --> 40:19.000
Aida, what are you doing?

40:22.170 --> 40:23.171
I'm sorry.

40:25.715 --> 40:27.175
I know how this feels.

41:04.004 --> 41:05.505
My apologies, Agent May.

41:13.305 --> 41:14.931
I'll have you cleaned up in no time.

41:27.486 --> 41:31.364
Once we crack that bottle,
it's open, no going back.

41:32.616 --> 41:33.617
Fine by me.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.872
There's nothing I'd rather be doing,
no place I'd rather be.

41:39.039 --> 41:40.415
You?

41:47.422 --> 41:48.757
I'm right where I belong.
