00:01.434 --> 00:03.402
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2010...</i>

00:03.503 --> 00:07.337
<i>it seemed like Aunt Lily could</i>
<i>only talk about one thing... babies.</i>

00:07.440 --> 00:10.204
Oh, God.
I have been craving this burger all day.

00:10.310 --> 00:13.677
Do you know what plays a huge role
in helping a woman conceive?

00:13.780 --> 00:15.304
- Mmm.
- Cervical mucus.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.406
Oh, God.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.145
Oh, my God. I can't wait to see this movie.
I hear it's really scary.

00:20.253 --> 00:21.880
Oh, change of plans.

00:21.988 --> 00:25.082
I thought violent images
wouldn't be good for my future fetus...

00:25.191 --> 00:29.184
so instead,
I rented this video of a live water birth.

00:31.898 --> 00:35.629
They don't know what it is.
It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.498
Look at this crib.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.765
<i>But all and all, it wasn't a problem.</i>

00:39.873 --> 00:42.501
<i>That is, until the night</i>
<i>of Barney's boutonniere.</i>

00:42.609 --> 00:44.702
- Oh, you're wearing a flower.
- Thank you.

00:44.811 --> 00:47.439
- I didn't compliment. Just observed.
- I know, isn't it?

00:47.547 --> 00:50.277
- Why are you wearing that?
- Why does Barney do anything ever?

00:50.383 --> 00:52.180
Exactly! Science!

00:52.285 --> 00:54.253
There is an 83% correlation...

00:54.354 --> 00:57.983
between the times men wear boutonnieres
and the times they get laid.

00:58.091 --> 01:02.528
Think about it...
proms, weddings, grandmas' funerals.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.824
Thanks for the redhead, Nana.

01:04.931 --> 01:08.662
The everyday boutonniere, by Stinson.

01:08.768 --> 01:11.703
And nope. I'm sorry, Barney,
but no girl is going home...

01:11.805 --> 01:13.830
with a guy with a flower on his chest...

01:13.940 --> 01:16.408
unless he's a clown
and she's in the trunk of his car.

01:16.509 --> 01:19.444
Along with 50 other clowns.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.643
It's a clown car.

01:23.750 --> 01:28.881
Robin, did you know that "boutonniere"
is French for "booty is near"?

01:28.988 --> 01:30.888
- Hmm.
- True story.

01:30.990 --> 01:33.356
- <i>Une histoire vraie.</i>
- Hmm.

01:33.460 --> 01:37.419
Did you know that " Barney" is French for " sad
little guy who works way too hard to get laid"?

01:37.530 --> 01:39.498
Woman, you best check yourself.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.466
Yeah, on the bright side,
I guess suits are pretty boring without them.

01:42.569 --> 01:46.505
Madam, that is an insult
that cannot be borne!

01:46.606 --> 01:48.597
I demand satisfaction!

01:48.708 --> 01:50.437
What, are we gonna duel?

01:50.543 --> 01:53.341
No, I'm gonna show everyone
this embarrassing video of you.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.415
It's Robin Sparkles 3, y'all.

02:11.364 --> 02:13.491
<i>Kids, by this point we knew Aunt Robin...</i>

02:13.600 --> 02:17.161
<i>had been a teen pop sensation in Canada</i>
<i>known as Robin Sparkles.</i>

02:17.270 --> 02:18.965
<i>And we also knew</i>
<i>that her Robin Sparkles character...</i>

02:19.072 --> 02:22.633
<i>came from a Canadian TVshow</i>
<i>which we'd never seen...</i>

02:22.742 --> 02:24.232
<i>until now.</i>

02:24.344 --> 02:26.141
I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!

02:26.246 --> 02:28.339
- You haven't watched it yet?
- No, of course not.

02:28.448 --> 02:31.042
I wanted my first time to be
with someone I cared about.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.483
- <i>That's so sweet.</i>
- I get that a lot. Well, once.

02:33.586 --> 02:36.817
Hey, Robin, do you wanna go get
a Korean massage on Saturday?

02:36.923 --> 02:39.983
I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck
that's so annoying.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.617
Yeah, I figured I should get one now...

02:41.728 --> 02:44.219
because once I get pregnant,
no more massages.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.231
- Just so annoying.
- Okay.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.604
<i>Space Teens?</i>

02:52.705 --> 02:54.263
Is this a porno?

02:54.374 --> 02:57.241
No, dude! Dude! It's a kid show.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.004
Oh.

03:00.079 --> 03:01.740
Yeah, yeah!

03:05.151 --> 03:07.551
I don't know.
This does have all the earmarks of porn.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.281
Stripper pole. Bad lighting.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.857
Delusional girl who thinks it's
a stepping stone to mainstream success.

03:11.958 --> 03:14.358
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a big ol' bowl of porn flakes.

03:21.901 --> 03:25.302
Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist...

03:25.405 --> 03:27.202
I assume you're about
to make sweet love to?

03:27.307 --> 03:28.934
Oh, that's Jessica Glitter.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.203
She was my B.F.F. on the show
and in real life.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.006
Ah, B.F.F.'s.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.979
Did you guys have sleepovers,
get mad at each other and wrestle...

03:36.082 --> 03:38.209
but then end up kissing
in a tender embrace?

03:38.318 --> 03:39.785
- Here, show us on Lily.
- You know what?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.945
If you're gonna be disgusting,
we're not watching this, okay?

03:42.055 --> 03:46.219
Yeah, come on, Barney.
It's just a cute little story about...

03:46.326 --> 03:48.226
What exactly is this about?

03:48.328 --> 03:52.128
Two average Canadian teenagers
who solve crimes in space using math.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.632
- That sounds ridiculous.
- So sue me...

03:54.734 --> 03:57.294
like the producers
of <i>Milky Way Mathletes</i> tried to.

04:06.579 --> 04:10.709
Great job using long division
to catch that space burglar, eh?

04:10.817 --> 04:15.777
What can I say? He'll be in galactic jail
for the remainder of his life.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.558
<i>Sparkles, Glitter.</i>

04:19.659 --> 04:21.490
<i>We're about to enter an asteroid belt, eh?</i>

04:21.594 --> 04:24.358
Brace for turbulence!

04:24.464 --> 04:26.694
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.101
I have to say, as much as I hate
to agree with Barney...

04:31.204 --> 04:33.934
this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.235
Okay, guys, come on! It's a kid show.

04:36.342 --> 04:39.277
Like, uh, <i>Electric Company</i>
or <i>Sesame Street</i> or, um...

04:39.379 --> 04:41.279
- You can't do that on television.
- Exactly.

04:41.381 --> 04:44.782
No. You can't do <i>that</i> on television.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.713
Robin, this show is so dirty...

04:51.824 --> 04:54.452
I don't know whether to hug you
or run a shower for you...

04:54.560 --> 04:56.994
so you can sit there alone,
crying and clenching your knees.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.530
It's just bad camera work, okay?

04:59.632 --> 05:01.793
Wayne, our camera guy...
he wasn't that great.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.835
I don't know.
I think he did a pretty good job...

05:03.936 --> 05:07.303
considering he was probably
only using one hand.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.568
You know what?
I feel bad for you Americans...

05:09.676 --> 05:13.237
that you can look at this wondrous and
educational adventure through space...

05:13.346 --> 05:15.041
and see something obscene.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.244
Can you just please try to look at this
with the innocence of a child?

05:19.352 --> 05:22.321
- Innocence of a child. Got it.
- Here we go.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.158
<i>Girls, if you wanna get through</i>
<i>the asteroid belt...</i>

05:26.259 --> 05:28.250
<i>you've got to use multiplication.</i>

05:28.361 --> 05:30.261
<i>To the joystickl</i>

05:32.598 --> 05:34.998
<i>Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply.</i>

05:35.101 --> 05:37.331
- <i>Five times six?</i>
- Ooh, 30.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.405
<i>Yesl Seven times four?</i>

05:39.505 --> 05:41.666
- <i>Twenty-eightl</i>
- <i>Keep going.</i>

05:41.774 --> 05:43.867
- <i>Eight times nine?</i>
- Seventy-two!

05:43.976 --> 05:46.274
<i>Don't stop nowl Almost there.</i>

05:46.379 --> 05:49.507
<i>Twenty-three times three?</i>

05:49.615 --> 05:51.276
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

05:51.384 --> 05:53.352
I'm sorry. We gotta ration this.

05:53.453 --> 05:56.854
It's like we're on a desert island
and this video is a really hot, naked chick...

05:56.956 --> 06:00.585
and she's got, like, seaweed on her
and a seashell bra.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.422
You all feel me.

06:02.528 --> 06:06.259
Hey, if you and Jessica are B.F.F.'s,
how come we've never met her?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.357
Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay?

06:08.468 --> 06:11.699
I get a Christmas card from her every year,
but we're not really friends anymore.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.931
But B.F.F.'s are forever.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.907
Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends
with their high school friends.

06:17.009 --> 06:20.308
- I'm still friends with Punchy.
- Dude, he lives in Cleveland.

06:20.413 --> 06:24.076
You see him once a year, at which point
he punches you really hard in the arm...

06:24.183 --> 06:26.242
and tells everyone
how you dookied your pants.

06:26.352 --> 06:29.549
I know on paper he sounds great,
but you guys aren't really friends.

06:29.655 --> 06:32.954
Look, I may not see him a lot,
but it doesn't matter.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.994
Observe.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.893
Schmosby!

06:38.998 --> 06:40.158
- Punchy!
- Schmosby!

06:40.266 --> 06:41.324
- Punchy!
- Schmosby!

06:41.434 --> 06:42.628
- Punchy!
- Schmosby!

06:42.735 --> 06:44.635
- Punchy!
- Hey, good talkin' to you, Ted.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.228
- Yeah, you too. If you're ever in New York.
- Definitely.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.400
We are just two peas.

06:51.511 --> 06:55.208
I don't get it. How can you and Glitter
just stop being friends?

06:55.314 --> 06:57.805
- Best friends don't do that.
- Well, we did, okay?

06:57.917 --> 07:00.750
And I haven't talked to her
in, like, five years, so just drop it.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.753
I gotta go.

07:05.024 --> 07:07.549
Whoa.

07:07.660 --> 07:10.561
What do you think came
between Robin and Jessica?

07:10.663 --> 07:13.188
Much like our friends, the Space Teens...

07:13.299 --> 07:16.996
I think I can solve this crime with math.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.336
Okay. Okay, here is a Christmas card
that Jessica sent Robin.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.344
- Lily, how old would you say that kid is?
- Four years, three months.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.880
Which means Jessica
got pregnant five years ago...

07:28.981 --> 07:31.176
right around the time
she and Robin stopped being friends.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.445
Of course. Robin hates kids.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.283
The last thing she would wanna do
is hang out with some little brat.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.847
Thus, if I may...

07:39.959 --> 07:42.928
When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear...

07:43.029 --> 07:47.022
Robin said,
"To hell with this, I'm outta h-hare."

07:49.402 --> 07:52.337
- Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.
- Oh!

07:52.438 --> 07:54.963
Wow. That's gotta be it. Right, Lil?

07:56.342 --> 07:59.709
- Lil?
- Robin's gonna dump me.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.780
Oh, sweetheart.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.975
Aha! When a second uterus
plumped becomes...

08:05.084 --> 08:07.450
Dude.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.180
Feel the room.

08:18.865 --> 08:21.060
- No.
- We've been waiting all day.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.657
Just watch it without me.

08:22.768 --> 08:25.498
Two dudes on the couch together
watching porn? That's kinda weird.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.368
Okay, it's not porn. It's a kid show.

08:27.473 --> 08:30.340
Two dudes watchin'
a kid show might be worse.

08:30.443 --> 08:33.173
- Okay, fine. I'll watch it with you.
- Yah!

08:33.279 --> 08:36.942
But if either of you makes even one peep
about this show being dirty, I'm turning it off.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.017
- I'm serious!
- We...

08:41.153 --> 08:43.553
Hey, Jessica. How's your beaver?

08:44.724 --> 08:47.022
Great. How's your beaver?

08:47.126 --> 08:49.686
Busy as ever.

08:51.564 --> 08:53.498
Our characters had pet beavers.

08:53.599 --> 08:57.035
- Sure.
- The beaver is the official animal of Canada.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.229
It's their national mascot.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.871
It's a noble creature.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.567
Okay, girls.

09:04.677 --> 09:08.204
Everyone knows a beaver's
favorite food is wood.

09:08.314 --> 09:12.375
I just hope we brought along enough of it
for a three-day galactic space journey.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.350
So let's do the math.

09:14.453 --> 09:18.913
If Robin's beaver devours six inches
of wood every half hour...

09:19.025 --> 09:22.893
<i>and Jessica's beaver devours</i>
<i>eight inches of wood every 45 minutes...</i>

09:22.995 --> 09:27.955
how much wood will I need to keep both of
these beavers well fed all weekend long?

09:29.869 --> 09:31.564
<i>While you figure it out at home...</i>

09:31.671 --> 09:34.697
how about we sing you a song
about our beavers?

09:34.807 --> 09:37.332
Hey...

09:37.443 --> 09:40.708
- Hey!
- You do not get to hear the beaver song!

09:40.813 --> 09:44.442
It is a sweet song about friendship,
and you guys are being disgusting!

09:44.550 --> 09:47.451
- And beavers are adorable!
- No arguments here.

09:52.191 --> 09:55.251
'Sup, Schmosby! What's the man doin'?

09:55.361 --> 09:56.953
Punchy, what are ya doin' here?

09:57.063 --> 10:00.396
Well, yesterday you said
if I was ever in New York.

10:00.499 --> 10:02.763
- 'Sup, turds?
- Ew.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.098
Okay. Um, uh, where you stayin'?

10:05.204 --> 10:08.173
In your mom's pants. Trick! She's old.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.799
Hey, don't worry about me.
I'm cool on the couch.

10:10.910 --> 10:14.038
- He's staying here? You're staying here?
- I know. It's so good, right?

10:14.146 --> 10:16.512
Feels like you're dreaming?
But check your totem, brah.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.710
Punchy's here in the flesh. So why don't
we get one of these, Ted? Yeah.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.480
Remember these? High school.

10:21.587 --> 10:23.953
Junior high.
Elementary school. Remember those?

10:24.056 --> 10:26.650
- Look, Punchy's here.
- Yeah.

10:26.759 --> 10:30.126
Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied
in your pants down by the lake?

10:30.229 --> 10:31.992
Unbelievable!

10:34.600 --> 10:36.898
Hey, Schmosby,
remember when you dookied on the couch...

10:37.003 --> 10:39.198
in the form of your idiot
high school friend?

10:40.873 --> 10:43.398
Unbelievable!

10:43.509 --> 10:45.534
Come on. I worry about the guy.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.637
He's had the same dead-end job
at a car rental place for 15 years.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.376
- Don't care.
- He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.282
- Get a hotel.
- Robin.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.356
- LeBron.
- Okay. One night.

10:58.190 --> 11:00.124
Gotta go.

11:00.226 --> 11:02.319
Hey. Where are you goin'?
We just got here.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.555
- Oh, uh, Korean massage.
- By yourself?

11:04.664 --> 11:08.361
Well, I figured you'd be busy reading <i>What</i>
<i>to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.</i>

11:10.703 --> 11:14.662
Guys, did you see that?
She's going to a Korean massage without me.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.605
That's our thing.

11:16.709 --> 11:20.167
I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me
just like she dumped Glitter.

11:20.279 --> 11:22.577
Lily, come on.
We don't even know that's what happened.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.140
Um, hello. Somebody already solved
that crime using math, remember?

11:26.252 --> 11:30.552
Look, Lily, Robin is clearly getting tired
of you constantly talking about babies.

11:30.656 --> 11:32.180
I don't...

11:32.291 --> 11:35.021
- Lily, how old am I?
- 384 months.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.424
Busted!

11:37.863 --> 11:40.661
Okay. So, before you
Lily all over the place...

11:40.766 --> 11:44.361
maybe you should try hanging out with Robin
and not talking about babies.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.062
<i>So, Lily did just that.</i>

11:46.172 --> 11:48.538
- <i>She tried not to talk about babies.</i>
- Hey!

11:48.641 --> 11:52.202
- Lily, what brings you to the crib?
- The crib.

11:52.311 --> 11:55.280
- What's the matter? You look rattled.
- Rattled?

11:55.381 --> 11:58.077
- I wanna talk about babies.
- What?

11:58.184 --> 12:00.584
Look, I know you don't care about this stuff...

12:00.686 --> 12:02.415
but I'm about to become a mother.

12:02.521 --> 12:05.046
And as a future mother,
I'm gonna need the support...

12:05.157 --> 12:07.785
Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet!

12:07.893 --> 12:09.383
What's that supposed to mean?

12:09.495 --> 12:12.157
It means that a fertilized egg
has not yet attached itself...

12:12.264 --> 12:13.959
to the lining of your uterine wall.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.227
You see? I read your Facebook updates.

12:16.335 --> 12:19.668
It's like... It's all you ever talk about,
Lily, and I'm sick of it!

12:19.772 --> 12:21.865
Well, guess what? I've got some good news.

12:21.974 --> 12:23.942
When that baby comes,
you don't have to see it.

12:24.043 --> 12:27.774
In fact, you don't have to see me.
This whole friendship thing... done.

12:27.880 --> 12:28.972
- Great.
- Great.

12:36.555 --> 12:39.080
For crying out loud,
you broke up with Robin?

12:39.191 --> 12:43.685
I had to. We were growing apart,
and we're better off without each other.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.923
Okay, Lily, you sound
about as convincing as you did...

12:46.031 --> 12:49.159
the time you <i>accidentally</i> shredded
my Joey Buttafuoco pants.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.135
No!

12:53.239 --> 12:56.265
Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.936
I can't. The damage is done.

13:00.045 --> 13:02.775
- Can you just hold me?
- You know what? No.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.976
I don't agree with what you did,
and so I refuse to comfort you...

13:06.085 --> 13:08.849
despite how adorable you are when you cry.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.649
Okay.

13:10.756 --> 13:14.283
Okay, maybe just one cuddle,
but then that's it.

13:15.761 --> 13:17.786
Time Square's da bomb!

13:17.897 --> 13:20.422
I got so many great pictures
of all the billboards.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.694
Yeah, you know, there's more
to New York than Times Square.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.498
There's the Village,
Lower East Side, Central Park.

13:25.604 --> 13:28.630
They got better billboards
than the ones in Times Square?

13:28.741 --> 13:31.403
- No.
- Times Square's da bomb!

13:31.510 --> 13:33.375
Here, you know what? Hold this, okay?

13:33.479 --> 13:36.039
I'm gonna go pee in the jar
I got goin' in the alley.

13:37.917 --> 13:42.411
Seriously, dude, he has got to go.

13:42.521 --> 13:44.421
You need to be, like...

13:44.523 --> 13:46.491
"You are the weakest link. Good-bye."

13:47.593 --> 13:49.993
Punchy, the tribe has spoken.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.188
Please pack up your knives and go.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.698
Your work of art didn't work for us.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.427
Your time's up.

13:56.535 --> 13:58.469
I have to ask you to leave the mansion.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.539
You must leave the château.

14:00.639 --> 14:02.231
Your tour ends here.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.935
- You've been chopped.
- Okay. Yeah, I know.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.602
You've been evicted
from the Big Brother house.

14:06.712 --> 14:10.443
Your dessert just didn't measure up.
Sashay away.

14:10.549 --> 14:13.040
Give me a jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen!

14:13.152 --> 14:14.949
I'm sorry. You did not get a rose.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.022
You have been eliminated from the race.

14:17.122 --> 14:20.319
You are no longer in the running
to be America's Next Top Model.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.053
You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.

14:22.161 --> 14:25.528
Ted, come look at this.

14:25.631 --> 14:28.293
I found a little wounded bird in the alley.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.768
That's your scrotum.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.808
You know it is, Ted. You know it is.
Come on, Ted. You always fall for that!

14:38.344 --> 14:40.812
Yeah, he's gotta go.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.853
What are we doing
in Madison Square Garden?

14:47.953 --> 14:51.753
You refused to talk to Robin,
so I thought that you might like to talk to...

14:51.857 --> 14:53.620
the organist for the New York Rangers.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.322
Jessica Glitter?

15:13.879 --> 15:15.938
How did you find Glitter?

15:16.048 --> 15:18.141
Simple, really.
I used my powers of deduction.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.913
You see, I knew that Glitter used to be
a keytarist, which is basically a piano...

15:22.021 --> 15:26.253
so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based
occupations, and then I cross matched...

15:26.358 --> 15:29.657
His friend Barney looked me up,
hoping to buy my Space Teens costume.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.095
And, Glitter, be cool.

15:33.198 --> 15:35.462
So, is this the one
who's best friends with Robin now?

15:35.567 --> 15:40.368
No, more like ex-best friends.
Just like you.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.599
Sorry to hear that.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.335
I miss Robin.

15:46.078 --> 15:48.774
Yeah, well, Marshall and I
are about to get pregnant...

15:48.881 --> 15:53.375
and I know she stopped being friends with you
when you had a baby, so...

15:53.485 --> 15:55.612
Oh, Robin didn't stop being friends with me.

15:55.721 --> 15:58.849
- I stopped being friends with her.
- What? Why?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.892
Because I had a baby.

16:00.993 --> 16:04.053
Honey, when you have a baby,
all that best friend stuff...

16:04.163 --> 16:06.825
hockey, bow hunting for caribou, math...

16:06.932 --> 16:08.832
that all goes out the window.

16:08.934 --> 16:11.835
I mean, I tried to stay friends with her,
but it just didn't happen.

16:11.937 --> 16:13.837
She took it pretty hard.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.998
I even thought
she might try to kill herself.

16:18.577 --> 16:20.408
Charge!

16:20.512 --> 16:23.538
Wow, you dumped her
just because you had a baby?

16:23.649 --> 16:28.052
- That's cold.
- Didn't you do the same thing, minus the baby?

16:28.153 --> 16:30.678
Oh, God. I gotta go.

16:30.789 --> 16:32.654
I gotta go apologize to Robin.

16:32.758 --> 16:36.353
l-I need to tell her I love her
and that she'll always be a priority.

16:36.462 --> 16:39.090
Be careful, Lily.
I made those promises too.

16:39.198 --> 16:42.895
And now I haven't even talked to her
in five years.

16:43.002 --> 16:48.099
Sure, I thought about picking up the phone
and calling her a hundred times...

16:48.207 --> 16:50.505
but I just never have the courage to act...

16:53.278 --> 16:55.109
Hey!

16:56.448 --> 16:58.473
Go ahead.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.623
Hey, do you guys get
<i>Big Chuck and Lil'John</i> out here?

17:07.726 --> 17:10.523
- Punchy, it's time to go back.
- Back to Times Square?

17:10.628 --> 17:13.462
Uh, no. Back... Back to Cleveland.

17:13.565 --> 17:15.760
I don't know if I can do that, bro.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.894
I mean, yeah, I been jonesin'
for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza...

17:19.003 --> 17:21.233
but I feel bad about leaving you out here.

17:21.339 --> 17:24.969
- I worry about you, Ted.
- You worry about me?

17:25.077 --> 17:27.704
Yeah. The other day when you called...

17:27.813 --> 17:29.212
- Schmosby!
- Punchy!

17:29.314 --> 17:31.441
- Good talkin' to you.
- You too. If you're ever in New York.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.415
Definitely.

17:36.522 --> 17:39.218
- Sweetie, who was that?
- It's my friend Ted.

17:39.324 --> 17:42.816
- He sounded kind of depressed.
- Is this the Ted who got left at the altar?

17:42.928 --> 17:46.591
Yeah. He's not doin' so good.

17:46.698 --> 17:50.998
Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment
in New York nowhere near Times Square.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.571
He's got no family around.
He's still single.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.470
Doesn't have a backyard.
It's just a bummer.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.203
Maybe you should go visit him,
cheer him up a little.

17:59.311 --> 18:02.439
You know, buy him some shots,
do the whole wounded bird trick.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.574
- You think that will work?
- Worked on me.

18:08.353 --> 18:11.686
Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.589
She's my angel.

18:14.693 --> 18:17.287
In fact, uh, we're getting married.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.393
Wow! Wow! That's...

18:20.499 --> 18:22.160
I'm... I'm really happy for you.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.996
Thanks, Ted. Thanks.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.833
Actually, that's the other reason
why I came out here.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.999
I wanted to see if you'd be my best man.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.705
- Of course I will.
- Yo!

18:33.812 --> 18:35.939
That's great. Oh, no, you're...

18:36.048 --> 18:39.415
- Cop out! Sucker! Oh, that's it! I'm not...
- Yeah.

18:39.651 --> 18:43.018
<i>That night, Lily went to</i>
<i>the one place she knew she could find Robin...</i>

18:43.122 --> 18:45.716
<i>New York's premiere Canadian bar,</i>
<i>the Hoser Hut.</i>

18:45.824 --> 18:49.453
Oh, there you are.
Robin, I owe you a huge apology.

18:49.561 --> 18:51.358
No, no. Me first.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.624
I've been pulling away from you,
and I'm sorry.

18:53.732 --> 18:56.462
It's just, the last time
my best friend had a baby...

18:56.568 --> 18:58.433
I know. I know all about it.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.734
It's not gonna happen with you and me.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.037
And I'm sorry I've been going crazy
with this baby stuff.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.169
It's... I know you hate babies.

19:07.279 --> 19:10.578
Whoa. Look, I hate most babies.

19:10.682 --> 19:14.140
But your baby...
I'm gonna love that kid so much.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.653
- I'm gonna pick it up and everything.
- Oh!

19:18.023 --> 19:21.982
- Ohh. I'm so happy you guys made up.
- Me too.

19:22.094 --> 19:25.154
Where do I know this song from?

19:25.264 --> 19:28.324
Oh, my God. It's the beaver song.
Okay, which one of you put this on?

19:29.434 --> 19:31.231
# Hey, beaver, come on #

19:32.504 --> 19:36.065
# When you feel alone #

19:36.175 --> 19:39.872
# Just pick up that phone #

19:39.978 --> 19:44.039
# And I'll be there to share my #

19:44.149 --> 19:47.516
# Ice-cream cone #

19:47.619 --> 19:51.180
# We'll lick it side by side #

19:51.290 --> 19:55.090
- Wow, this is so dirty.
- Come on, Barney.
It's a sweet song about friendship.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.752
Yeah. Dude, come on.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.592
# Before the day is done #

20:01.366 --> 20:04.767
# Two beavers are better than one #

20:04.870 --> 20:08.897
# Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da #

20:09.007 --> 20:12.135
# Two beavers are better than one #

20:12.244 --> 20:13.939
# They're twice the fun #

20:14.046 --> 20:16.810
- # Ask anyone #
- Whoo-hoo!

20:16.915 --> 20:20.248
# A second beaver can be #

20:20.352 --> 20:22.786
# Second to none #

20:22.888 --> 20:25.982
# Two beavers are better than one #

20:26.091 --> 20:27.115
Whoo!

20:27.226 --> 20:29.217
# Da-da, da-da-da #

20:29.328 --> 20:32.229
# You're my favorite beaver #
