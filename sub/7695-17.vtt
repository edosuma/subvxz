00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.039 --> 00:10.541
Well, guys,
it took a while,

00:10.541 --> 00:12.983
but we finally came up with
S1's new name.

00:12.983 --> 00:15.786
We went through hundreds
before we came up with
the perfect one.

00:15.786 --> 00:17.688
- What is it?
- Charlotte.
- Taylor.

00:19.790 --> 00:24.125
Right. Taylor.
My... second choice.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.656
I like it.

00:25.656 --> 00:27.628
Yeah, great name.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.100
Eh, doesn't really
matter to me.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.961
I didn't remember
your other name,

00:30.961 --> 00:32.933
and I'm not gonna
remember this one, either.

00:34.765 --> 00:36.637
Hey, guys.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.809
I have some
very exciting news.

00:38.809 --> 00:42.513
You're finally eligible
for senior citizen discounts?

00:42.513 --> 00:44.915
No. Maybe.

00:44.915 --> 00:48.279
I don't wanna talk about it.
Look...

00:48.279 --> 00:50.781
The president called,
and he's honoring you guys

00:50.781 --> 00:54.455
with a prestigious award for
completing mission number 1,000.

00:54.455 --> 00:57.288
That's awesome.
Congratulations, guys.

00:57.288 --> 00:59.290
Thanks, but technically,

00:59.290 --> 01:02.463
if you count all the missions
where our bionics were
still a secret,

01:02.463 --> 01:05.035
then our number
is actually 2,604.

01:05.035 --> 01:06.367
But who's counting?

01:06.367 --> 01:09.200
You are.
That's all you do is count.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.572
I do not.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.875
Just for the record,
that's the 53rd time
you've told me that.

01:16.046 --> 01:18.179
This is gonna be great.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.781
It's about time I got
honored for something.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.783
So when is
this little shindig?

01:22.783 --> 01:24.615
Uh, in a couple of weeks.

01:24.615 --> 01:27.118
There's gonna be
a big, fancy ceremony
on the mainland.

01:27.118 --> 01:29.019
But the president's
only honoring the original team,

01:29.019 --> 01:30.691
Adam, Bree and Chase.

01:30.691 --> 01:34.024
What? How can
he do that?

01:34.024 --> 01:36.527
I go on missions with
them all the time.

01:36.527 --> 01:40.531
I'm sure when they
hand out awards for
completing 32 1/2 missions,

01:40.531 --> 01:42.032
you'll get yours.

01:43.874 --> 01:48.539
It's actually 31 1/2,
but who's counting?

01:51.842 --> 01:54.845
The world's first
 bionic superhumans.

01:54.845 --> 01:56.517
They're stronger than us.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.190
Faster.
 Smarter.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.822
The next generation
 of the human race is...

02:01.822 --> 02:03.894
living on a bionic island.

02:40.431 --> 02:42.933
Hey, Adam, how's the fire
prevention training going?

02:42.933 --> 02:45.436
You said fire prevention?

02:45.436 --> 02:48.098
- ( alarm blaring )
- Ooh, well,

02:48.098 --> 02:50.971
it's too late
to prevent that one.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.773
Could you guys go
put that fire out

02:52.773 --> 02:54.745
and prevent the other 15
we set?

02:56.106 --> 02:58.409
Guys, you have to
come see this.

02:58.409 --> 03:00.311
Leo just did something
super amazing.

03:03.314 --> 03:05.416
Aww. Leo's holding
hands with a girl.

03:05.416 --> 03:07.588
That is amazing.

03:07.588 --> 03:11.292
It's not a girl,
it's Taylor.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.993
A girl with very sharp
fingernails.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.666
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

03:15.666 --> 03:17.998
Uh, the point is,
we found a new ability.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.000
Check this out.

03:26.036 --> 03:27.177
Now.

03:30.241 --> 03:33.314
ADAM: Oh, man, now I can't
see what the new ability is.

03:34.985 --> 03:36.887
LEO: That was
the new ability.

03:36.887 --> 03:39.250
Well, do you have
another that turns
you into a night light?

03:40.991 --> 03:43.754
CHASE: Hold on. I'll bring
the back-up system online.

03:46.297 --> 03:49.360
We accidentally found it
when we locked hands
during combat training.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.632
Technically, I was
helping him off the floor

03:51.632 --> 03:53.834
after I body slammed him.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.537
Body slammed. It was more
like a somersault.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.038
You want me
to show 'em?

03:58.038 --> 03:59.370
No, no, we're good.

04:00.771 --> 04:04.475
So? Isn't our
new ability cool?

04:04.475 --> 04:06.517
When we join hands,
our laser spheres combine

04:06.517 --> 04:08.779
to create one large sphere
that's so powerful,

04:08.779 --> 04:10.621
it sends out
an electromagnetic pulse.

04:10.621 --> 04:14.385
EMP's disable any piece
of electrical technology
they touch.

04:14.385 --> 04:16.086
Dude, that was incredible.

04:16.086 --> 04:17.728
One day, I'm gonna
be just like you.

04:17.728 --> 04:20.230
Thank you, son.
Now move along.

04:20.230 --> 04:24.565
Uh, no offense, Logan,
but when did Leo
become your hero?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.437
Are you kidding?
Talk about an underdog.

04:26.437 --> 04:28.238
He was just a regular guy.

04:28.238 --> 04:30.070
All of a sudden,
he got bionics and became

04:30.070 --> 04:31.902
an inspiration to
the whole world.

04:31.902 --> 04:34.645
That is my story.

04:34.645 --> 04:36.877
And I love how he didn't
let his scrawny body

04:36.877 --> 04:39.109
- and inferior skill
set stop him.
- We got it, Logan.

04:40.751 --> 04:43.153
I'm a little worried
about this new ability.

04:43.153 --> 04:45.716
EMP's are very,
very dangerous.

04:45.716 --> 04:47.458
But if we had this
when Krane was around,

04:47.458 --> 04:49.560
we could've shut down
his triton app in a second.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.992
It doesn't matter.
It's still dangerous.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.396
Don't use it again until
we've had time to study it
in a controlled environment.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.697
- Come on, Chase.
- No.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.699
- If we just--
- You heard me.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.631
No more EMP's.

05:03.474 --> 05:05.636
Boo.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.943
All right, guys,
let's get back to work.

05:12.943 --> 05:15.346
Next up, CPR training.

05:15.346 --> 05:18.549
Uh, no, wait.
CPR prevention.

05:22.453 --> 05:24.294
I hate this.

05:24.294 --> 05:25.826
I've worked so hard
to prove myself,

05:25.826 --> 05:27.628
but it doesn't matter.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.500
They're always gonna see me
as their little brother

05:29.500 --> 05:31.301
- who's barely bionic.
- If it makes you feel better,

05:31.301 --> 05:33.303
I think our new ability
is super cool.

05:33.303 --> 05:36.006
Yeah. They're just jealous
'cause they were born perfect,

05:36.006 --> 05:38.539
and you were born a teeny,
tiny, weakling--

05:38.539 --> 05:40.941
Shut it.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.144
I'm so sick of them
not taking me seriously.

05:44.144 --> 05:47.317
It's time prove I'm as much
a bionic hero as they are.

05:47.317 --> 05:50.220
I hear you, Leo.
And we got your back.

05:50.220 --> 05:51.782
Thanks, guys.

05:51.782 --> 05:53.283
Means a lot.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.959
Yeah, we gotta stop
doing that.

06:07.297 --> 06:10.741
- Hey, Donnie.
- Hey, Douglas.

06:10.741 --> 06:14.104
You know, there's nothing
like getting under
the hood of a car

06:14.104 --> 06:15.876
and working with
your hands to make
you feel like

06:15.876 --> 06:17.207
a real man.

06:17.207 --> 06:19.079
You got some oil
on your face.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.911
Oh, that's not oil.

06:20.911 --> 06:24.114
That's an organic
sea kelp
facial cream.

06:24.114 --> 06:27.888
Gives me the pores of
a 14-year-old Taiwanese girl.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.590
Yikes.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.462
How bad is her life?

06:33.464 --> 06:35.426
What's with
the fancy car?

06:35.426 --> 06:38.028
Oh, I'm up for the contract to
redesign the president's limo,

06:38.028 --> 06:40.200
so I thought I'd
surprise him at
the awards ceremony,

06:40.200 --> 06:42.202
and get a jump on
the competition.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.105
Great idea.
Presidents love surprises.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.877
Just give me the heads up
so I can film

06:46.877 --> 06:48.779
the secret service
taking you down.

06:48.779 --> 06:51.081
He's gonna love it.

06:51.081 --> 06:53.444
I adapted
my self-driving car,

06:53.444 --> 06:56.346
and made the most
indestructible limo ever.

06:56.346 --> 06:57.618
It'll be the safest
form of transportation

06:57.618 --> 06:59.920
any president has
ever used.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.594
Take that, Air Force One.

07:03.594 --> 07:07.397
You should definitely say that
to the secret service.

07:07.397 --> 07:09.560
Why don't I
test it for you?

07:09.560 --> 07:12.002
I know a thing or two
about destruction.

07:12.002 --> 07:15.536
Nothing is indestructible
in my hands.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.037
( car alarm chirps )

07:17.037 --> 07:19.039
Please. You cannot destroy
this car.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.971
You can't even
get into this car.

07:20.971 --> 07:23.674
- This car is as
Douglas-proof...
- ( horn honks )

07:26.517 --> 07:28.178
You were saying.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.025
We've really been on
1,000 missions?

07:35.025 --> 07:37.427
It felt more like six.

07:37.427 --> 07:40.090
Nope. It was
way more than that,

07:40.090 --> 07:42.432
and I remember
all of them.

07:42.432 --> 07:45.265
Literally. They're backed up
on my hard drive.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.937
Maybe you should
clear a few out.

07:46.937 --> 07:49.500
You know, free up
some space to add
some personality,

07:49.500 --> 07:52.272
or a sense of humor.
You know, a likeable trait.

07:54.775 --> 07:58.008
- Hey, Leo.
- Don't talk to me
like I'm a child.

07:58.008 --> 08:01.081
All I said was
"Hey, Leo."

08:01.081 --> 08:04.054
Well, I detected a tone.

08:04.054 --> 08:05.856
What's up with you?

08:05.856 --> 08:07.758
I'll tell you
what's up with me.

08:07.758 --> 08:09.620
I am tired of everyone
treating me like

08:09.620 --> 08:12.122
some kind of non-existent
bionic hero.

08:12.122 --> 08:15.365
Just because it's true
doesn't mean you have to
take it personally.

08:16.667 --> 08:19.329
Oh, really?
Well, guess what.

08:19.329 --> 08:22.903
We're starting
our own team.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.105
That's right. You're looking at
the next generation

08:25.105 --> 08:27.778
of bionic superhumans.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.642
It's the other way
like we rehearsed.

08:31.642 --> 08:34.615
Oh, right.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.746
And, uh, who might be
the leader

08:36.746 --> 08:38.948
of this new bionic team?

08:38.948 --> 08:40.621
You're looking at him.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.153
( laughs )
You kidding me? Leo?

08:43.153 --> 08:46.256
See, right there.
There's that tone.

08:46.256 --> 08:49.660
Look, you don't just become
a leader by saying that
you're a leader.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.431
It takes years of
mission experience.

08:51.431 --> 08:54.204
You named yourself mission
leader when you were 14.

08:54.204 --> 08:56.036
Eh, wrong.
I was 12.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.508
Good thing someone
around here counts.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.241
You're not ready.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.274
Oh, yes, I am, and I'm going
to prove to you that I'm ready.

09:04.274 --> 09:05.816
Sold!

09:05.816 --> 09:07.217
You were already on board.

09:07.217 --> 09:08.348
And yet he sold me again.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.180
He's that good.

09:11.782 --> 09:14.925
Is Mr. Davenport
okay with this?

09:14.925 --> 09:17.387
Douglas thinks he's gonna
beat me at my own game.

09:17.387 --> 09:19.029
I don't think so.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.933
Hey, Big D., is it cool
if I start my own team?

09:22.933 --> 09:25.235
Yeah, Leo, whatever.
"It's indestructible."

09:25.235 --> 09:28.138
Ha! Victory pose.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.673
Other way, sir.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.980
Okay, Douglas,
you may have found

09:39.980 --> 09:41.281
a way to break into
my limo,

09:41.281 --> 09:44.514
but you will never
break my limo.

09:44.514 --> 09:48.058
Adam, I need you to show him
that it is indestructible.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.062
Fire your heat vision.

09:53.223 --> 09:55.065
( shrieks )

09:55.065 --> 09:57.127
Not at me,
at the car.

09:57.127 --> 09:58.769
Okay, you can't just tell me
to fire.

09:58.769 --> 10:00.771
You have to be
more explicit.

10:00.771 --> 10:02.302
You know the word explicit,

10:02.302 --> 10:04.574
but you don't know
the word indestructible.

10:04.574 --> 10:06.737
Yep. It's a conundrum.

10:06.737 --> 10:11.211
Fire your heat vision
at the car.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.894
See? Indestructible.

10:23.894 --> 10:26.096
Not so fast, Donnie.

10:26.096 --> 10:29.099
You might wanna
back up for this one.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.533
( explosion )

10:37.668 --> 10:41.071
My limo!

10:41.071 --> 10:43.844
Ah, relax.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.445
We can help you.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.878
Together, Adam and I
can pretty much

10:47.878 --> 10:50.721
break into or destroy
anything.

10:50.721 --> 10:53.223
We can make this limo
impenetrable.

10:53.223 --> 10:55.555
Yeah. I'm not really
interested in helping.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.027
I just wanna
blow stuff up.

11:00.330 --> 11:03.433
Faster, faster.
Mush! Mush!

11:03.433 --> 11:05.195
And stop.

11:05.195 --> 11:07.698
How is carrying you
down an imaginary mountain

11:07.698 --> 11:09.669
part of our training?

11:09.669 --> 11:12.472
Because a good team
should be prepared
for anything,

11:12.472 --> 11:14.544
and this could happen.

11:14.544 --> 11:16.847
You never know when
your leader's gonna get
taken out of battle,

11:16.847 --> 11:19.509
or break a bone, or get
a case of the dizzies
from a light lunch.

11:19.509 --> 11:22.783
- I don't mind
carrying you, Leo.
- Thank you.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.855
I mean, you're, like,
the lightest human being ever.

11:24.855 --> 11:27.617
Hey! I am not light.

11:27.617 --> 11:30.490
With a full bladder,
I am pushing triple digits.

11:32.122 --> 11:33.493
Can we take a break?

11:33.493 --> 11:35.926
Yeah. You guys have
been working hard.

11:35.926 --> 11:37.297
I guess you do
deserve a breather.

11:38.769 --> 11:40.170
Hey, Leo.

11:40.170 --> 11:42.733
Break's over.
Everybody up.

11:42.733 --> 11:44.304
How's your
new team doing?

11:44.304 --> 11:46.676
Great.
You see this right here?

11:46.676 --> 11:48.138
This is a little something
we like to call

11:48.138 --> 11:49.639
leading and training.

11:49.639 --> 11:53.784
Really? Looks to me like
standing and talking.

11:53.784 --> 11:56.586
We carried him all the way
down an imaginary mountain.

11:56.586 --> 11:57.948
Why?

11:57.948 --> 11:59.750
Because the guy
weighs 60 pounds.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.151
Give him a break.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.524
We've been working hard.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.496
We found a way
to include Logan

12:06.496 --> 12:08.528
and make our new ability
even better.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.400
Check this out.

12:17.067 --> 12:19.709
Leo, I specifically
told you not to do that again.

12:19.709 --> 12:21.211
It's too dangerous.

12:21.211 --> 12:23.343
Too dangerous,
or too awesome?

12:24.574 --> 12:26.746
Now I'm gonna use
my energy manipulation

12:26.746 --> 12:28.849
to guide their EMP
toward a target.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.451
Not yet, junior.
These kids came
for a show.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.253
Amp it up, Tay-tay.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.231
Okay, now I'm gonna--

12:41.231 --> 12:42.662
Not yet.

12:44.734 --> 12:46.696
Leo, it's too much
for her.

12:46.696 --> 12:48.869
Oh, please, you're just
jealous that your team

12:48.869 --> 12:50.540
isn't as powerful
as mine.

12:50.540 --> 12:51.701
Leo, stop!

12:51.701 --> 12:53.543
Back off.
This is my team.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.077
Taylor!

13:00.911 --> 13:02.752
She's barely breathing.
Go get help.

13:13.924 --> 13:16.766
Mr. Davenport,
how's Taylor?

13:16.766 --> 13:18.829
The good news is,
I flew in the best doctors

13:18.829 --> 13:21.471
money could buy,
so she's in good hands.

13:21.471 --> 13:23.433
How seriously
is she hurt?

13:23.433 --> 13:25.435
She's in
critical condition.

13:25.435 --> 13:27.437
We'll know more
when she wakes up.

13:29.980 --> 13:32.482
I'm sorry, Big D.
I feel terrible.

13:32.482 --> 13:34.144
You should.

13:34.144 --> 13:36.987
What were you thinking,
making her max out her
abilities?

13:36.987 --> 13:38.488
I didn't think
she'd get hurt.

13:38.488 --> 13:39.519
I just wanted
to show everyone

13:39.519 --> 13:41.191
what my new team
could do.

13:41.191 --> 13:43.924
New team? Who said
you could have a new team?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.795
You did.

13:45.795 --> 13:47.597
Earlier today when
you walked through here.

13:47.597 --> 13:50.100
Well, you should know better
than to bother me

13:50.100 --> 13:52.262
when I'm focused on me.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.936
Look, I have to get back
to the infirmary.

13:55.936 --> 13:59.269
I'll let you guys know
if there's any other news.

13:59.269 --> 14:03.373
You should've stopped
when I told you to.

14:03.373 --> 14:05.775
This just proves you're
not ready to lead your own team.

14:05.775 --> 14:08.118
I am more than ready.

14:08.118 --> 14:10.320
And maybe I wouldn't feel
like I need to prove that
to you guys

14:10.320 --> 14:12.752
if you weren't always
looking down on me.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.925
Leo, we don't
look down on you.

14:14.925 --> 14:18.458
Yeah, we have total respect
for all of your shortcomings.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.531
When are you guys gonna
stop treating me like
I'm an idiot?

14:21.531 --> 14:23.994
Maybe when you stop
acting like one.

14:23.994 --> 14:26.836
You know what? Maybe
quitting your team
wasn't enough.

14:26.836 --> 14:28.838
Maybe I need to quit
being your brother, too.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.874
Don't worry, Chase.
He can't legally do that.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.978
Trust me.
I've looked into it.

14:41.351 --> 14:44.254
Look, Logan,
I know this is
a stressful time,

14:44.254 --> 14:47.988
but the best thing
we can do is keep training.

14:47.988 --> 14:51.421
- Taylor would have
wanted that.
- She's dead?!

14:51.421 --> 14:54.824
No. I mean, if she were here,
she would've wanted that.

14:54.824 --> 14:57.497
Oh, okay.
I'm just really worried.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.469
The doctors won't even
let us see her.

14:59.469 --> 15:02.032
- That can't be good.
- It's okay to be concerned.

15:02.032 --> 15:03.974
I am, too.

15:03.974 --> 15:06.606
But we need to be
a team now more than ever.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.039
- For Taylor.
- She's in heaven?!

15:09.039 --> 15:10.640
No.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.913
Upstairs.
In the infirmary.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.485
Just trust me.

15:15.485 --> 15:17.187
She's gonna be back
before you know it.

15:17.187 --> 15:19.389
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

15:19.389 --> 15:21.751
Big D. has the best doctors
in the world taking care of her.

15:21.751 --> 15:23.923
Not to mention every piece
of bionic technology

15:23.923 --> 15:25.195
at his disposal.

15:25.195 --> 15:26.696
I mean, look at my leg.

15:26.696 --> 15:28.928
After I was crushed
by the space elevator,

15:28.928 --> 15:31.461
not only did he fix it,
but now it's better than ever.

15:31.461 --> 15:33.233
I thought you said
it locks up when it rains.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.834
I'm waiting
on a part.

15:37.407 --> 15:39.909
Donnie's gonna be
wrapped up with
Taylor for a while,

15:39.909 --> 15:42.542
so let's use this time
to finally perfect this thing.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.414
So what do you think?

15:48.318 --> 15:50.820
You sure there's
enough dynamite?

15:50.820 --> 15:53.053
Oh, Adam.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.725
There's never
enough dynamite.

15:56.926 --> 15:58.258
Let's light this candle.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.060
Ooh. Good idea.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.961
A little lavender will
help cover up

16:01.961 --> 16:03.994
the stench of
burning car.

16:03.994 --> 16:06.496
Just push the button.

16:06.496 --> 16:08.698
Okay. Here we go.

16:13.843 --> 16:17.007
- You okay?
- No. You?

16:17.007 --> 16:19.079
No.

16:23.713 --> 16:26.056
But the limo is.

16:26.056 --> 16:28.188
We did it.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.391
We made it
indestructible.

16:33.263 --> 16:36.026
What's wrong?

16:36.026 --> 16:37.727
Now that it works,

16:37.727 --> 16:40.530
we don't get to
blow stuff up anymore.

16:40.530 --> 16:42.672
Well...

16:42.672 --> 16:47.307
we could always try to make
Donnie's yacht indestructible.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.680
It's already
rigged to blow.

16:56.446 --> 16:58.948
Chase, what's going on?

16:58.948 --> 17:01.851
Mr. Davenport has
another update on Taylor.

17:05.155 --> 17:06.656
Hello.

17:06.656 --> 17:08.897
Excuse me, sir.

17:08.897 --> 17:11.961
Now that we aren't brothers,
what should I call you?

17:14.664 --> 17:17.067
- Hi, Logan.
- Hey, guys.
Good to see you.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.709
- Ahem!
- Oh, right.
We're still mad at them.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.372
Hey, guys, it is not
good to see you.

17:28.278 --> 17:30.820
How is she?

17:30.820 --> 17:33.022
Awake. She's gonna make it.

17:34.023 --> 17:36.386
See? Told ya.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.358
So what kind of bionic
upgrades did you throw in?

17:38.358 --> 17:40.730
Rocket feet
or rocket elbows?

17:40.730 --> 17:42.892
Rocket hips?

17:42.892 --> 17:44.864
Just sayin' the girl
could use some rockets.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.197
No, Leo.

17:47.197 --> 17:49.369
Taylor made it,

17:49.369 --> 17:53.042
but the laser spheres
damaged her retinas.

17:53.042 --> 17:54.874
She's lost her eyesight.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.676
She's blind.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.178
What?

17:59.549 --> 18:01.511
We tried everything,

18:01.511 --> 18:04.053
but no amount of bionics
will fix this.

18:04.053 --> 18:05.955
It's permanent.

18:07.757 --> 18:10.190
Permanent
for how long?

18:12.061 --> 18:13.523
You can't just give up.

18:13.523 --> 18:15.225
There's gotta be
something you can do.

18:15.225 --> 18:16.966
You have to
keep trying.

18:16.966 --> 18:19.098
I'm sorry, Leo.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.875
I can't believe it.

18:25.875 --> 18:29.008
She's never gonna see again.

18:29.008 --> 18:32.142
It's all because of me.

18:32.142 --> 18:35.815
But you said she was
gonna be okay.

18:47.797 --> 18:50.600
Donnie, I think you're
gonna be really happy

18:50.600 --> 18:52.602
with the work we did
on the limo.

18:52.602 --> 18:55.305
It is now officially
indestructible.

18:55.305 --> 18:57.767
And all of your other forms
of high-end transportation

18:57.767 --> 18:59.669
are officially not.

19:03.313 --> 19:07.116
You guys seen Leo? He wasn't at
breakfast this morning.

19:07.116 --> 19:09.319
That's because
I was packing.

19:09.319 --> 19:12.282
Leo, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be training.

19:12.282 --> 19:15.255
I'm going back to
Mission Creek.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.387
I don't belong here
anymore.

19:17.387 --> 19:19.028
I'm quitting
the academy.

19:19.028 --> 19:20.960
What?

19:20.960 --> 19:23.593
- Wait, we can do that?
- Adam!

19:23.593 --> 19:26.596
Look, Leo, I know
you're upset about Taylor,

19:26.596 --> 19:28.037
but it was an accident.

19:28.037 --> 19:30.400
No. Chase was right.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.042
I'm not cut out
to be a leader.

19:33.042 --> 19:35.545
I never meant
for you to leave.

19:35.545 --> 19:38.748
Part of being a leader
is making mistakes.

19:38.748 --> 19:41.211
You learn from them,
and you move on.

19:41.211 --> 19:43.383
Look at Chase. Think of
all the mistakes he's made

19:43.383 --> 19:44.784
as mission leader.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.786
Yeah. Remember when
the particle collider

19:46.786 --> 19:48.488
collapsed on us
because of him?

19:48.488 --> 19:50.490
Or when he told Sebastian
about Krane,

19:50.490 --> 19:52.492
- and started the rebellion.
- Or the other time--

19:52.492 --> 19:55.164
Mistakes were made.
We get it!

19:55.164 --> 19:57.427
But his never hurt anyone.

19:57.427 --> 19:59.669
Taylor has to live with
my mistake

19:59.669 --> 20:02.001
for the rest of her life.

20:02.001 --> 20:05.004
So you're just gonna
give up and leave?

20:05.004 --> 20:06.536
What about our team?

20:06.536 --> 20:09.178
Logan, you deserve
a better team.

20:09.178 --> 20:11.541
Or at least
a better leader.

20:11.541 --> 20:14.043
I'm not gonna put you
or anyone else here

20:14.043 --> 20:16.886
in danger ever again.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.150
Here.

20:21.150 --> 20:24.254
Give it to someone
more deserving.

20:24.254 --> 20:26.256
Leo, I'm not
gonna let you--

20:26.256 --> 20:28.197
Yes, you are,

20:28.197 --> 20:30.159
because it's not
your choice.

20:30.159 --> 20:32.332
It's mine.

20:33.503 --> 20:35.335
Bye, guys.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.467
Sorry I let you down.

20:55.124 --> 20:58.157
It's really weird
not having you here, Leo.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.189
Everybody really
misses you.

21:00.189 --> 21:02.191
It's been two weeks.

21:02.191 --> 21:04.233
When are you
coming back?

21:04.233 --> 21:05.935
I'm sorry, guys.

21:05.935 --> 21:08.237
When I said I was done,
I meant it.

21:08.237 --> 21:10.239
I've hung up my mission suit
forever.

21:10.239 --> 21:11.641
Then can I have it?

21:11.641 --> 21:14.243
I found a guy in Japan
who's willing to pay top dollar.

21:15.605 --> 21:17.577
I appreciate the call,

21:17.577 --> 21:19.549
but things are actually
great back here.

21:19.549 --> 21:22.552
School is much better
without Perry,

21:22.552 --> 21:25.054
and I get to spend
a ton of time with my mom.

21:25.054 --> 21:28.388
Every 16-year-old
boy's dream.

21:28.388 --> 21:31.090
Are you sure
we can't change your mind?

21:31.090 --> 21:33.222
Sorry, guys.
I'm staying here.

21:33.222 --> 21:34.494
I gotta go.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.195
Mom's hosting her book club
tonight,

21:36.195 --> 21:38.528
and I'm in charge
of dessert.

21:38.528 --> 21:41.401
Turns out my laser sphere
has caramelized the perfect
crème brulée.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.833
Whoo, that sounds good.

21:43.833 --> 21:45.575
Do I, uh,
have to read a book

21:45.575 --> 21:47.236
to get in on that?

21:49.078 --> 21:51.341
Later, guys.

21:51.341 --> 21:54.043
I feel bad.

21:54.043 --> 21:55.885
We should've given him
more credit.

21:55.885 --> 21:58.217
I know.

21:58.217 --> 22:00.790
He deserves to be
up there with us at
the award ceremony tomorrow.

22:00.790 --> 22:02.452
Couldn't agree
with you more.

22:02.452 --> 22:05.425
And that's why
he's gonna be.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.757
Say hello to
the newest member

22:07.757 --> 22:09.959
of the bionic team.

22:09.959 --> 22:12.862
Cardboard Leo.

22:12.862 --> 22:15.134
What is that?

22:15.134 --> 22:18.638
Uh, it's a life-size
cardboard cutout of Leo,

22:18.638 --> 22:20.370
hence the name
Cardboard Leo.

22:20.370 --> 22:24.143
Pay attention, Chase.
This stuff isn't that hard.

22:24.143 --> 22:27.947
I think what he means
is, are you crazy?!

22:27.947 --> 22:30.279
We can't bring that
to the ceremony.

22:30.279 --> 22:31.781
Of course we can,

22:31.781 --> 22:34.123
and if things get boring,
I'm gonna fold him into
an airplane

22:34.123 --> 22:35.955
and fly him around.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.458
( makes flying sounds )

22:38.458 --> 22:40.630
Wheee!

22:42.291 --> 22:43.763
So 9:00 a.m. tomorrow,

22:43.763 --> 22:45.765
we'll take the hydra loop
to the mainland

22:45.765 --> 22:48.438
and we will travel to
the president's award ceremony

22:48.438 --> 22:49.999
in my self-driving limo.

22:49.999 --> 22:51.601
I call shotgun.

22:51.601 --> 22:52.972
Adam, it's a limo.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.475
Everyone rides
in the back.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.146
You sit where you want.

22:57.146 --> 22:59.909
I will still be
holding the shotgun.

23:01.811 --> 23:03.783
Once the president
is dazzled,

23:03.783 --> 23:05.485
I will undoubtedly
be showered with

23:05.485 --> 23:07.917
a big, fat contract
and piles of cash,

23:07.917 --> 23:10.319
which I just might
share with you three.

23:10.319 --> 23:11.991
- Really?
- No.

23:13.493 --> 23:14.994
Wait, wait, wait.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.866
So even though it's
our award ceremony,

23:16.866 --> 23:18.528
now it's become
all about you?

23:18.528 --> 23:20.369
For the smartest
man in the world,

23:20.369 --> 23:23.603
it really took you a long time
to figure that out.

23:27.537 --> 23:29.378
- BREE: Taylor.
- CHASE: Taylor.

23:31.711 --> 23:35.745
( loudly ) Hey!
Good to see you
up and around.

23:35.745 --> 23:38.187
Just so you know,
this is Adam.

23:38.187 --> 23:41.420
I lost my vision,
not my hearing.

23:41.420 --> 23:45.955
She obviously didn't lose
that nasty attitude either.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.058
What are those glasses?

23:49.058 --> 23:51.360
My latest piece of
technology

23:51.360 --> 23:53.162
that I customized
for her.

23:53.162 --> 23:56.235
High-tech lenses that use
a series of laser-guided sensors

23:56.235 --> 23:58.538
to enhance
her spatial awareness.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.740
They don't allow me to see
in the traditional sense,

24:00.740 --> 24:02.972
but they vibrate
to let me know...

24:02.972 --> 24:05.715
when there's an obstacle
in my path.

24:05.715 --> 24:08.878
That's so cool.
I wanna try.

24:10.179 --> 24:12.351
Ow. So sorry, so sorry.
Please don't hurt me.

24:13.483 --> 24:14.884
Hey, I'm impressed, Taylor.

24:14.884 --> 24:17.056
You've made a lot of
progress in a few weeks.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.358
Thanks. I have been
working really hard.

24:19.358 --> 24:22.031
Have any of you guys
spoken to Leo?

24:22.031 --> 24:23.462
I was hoping someone
convinced him

24:23.462 --> 24:25.434
to come back to
the academy by now.

24:25.434 --> 24:27.296
We talked to him
earlier today,

24:27.296 --> 24:28.938
but no luck.

24:28.938 --> 24:30.269
He won't change
his mind.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.271
( loudly ) Oh, yeah,
it's really annoying

24:32.271 --> 24:34.974
when people don't
understand what
you're going through.

24:36.946 --> 24:40.149
You see, there's
that attitude again.

24:43.513 --> 24:46.756
Hey, which dress do you like
better for the ceremony?

24:46.756 --> 24:48.187
Red or black?

24:48.187 --> 24:49.659
What do I know?

24:49.659 --> 24:51.460
Come on, I don't have
any sisters.

24:51.460 --> 24:53.162
I need someone to help me
with this stuff.

24:53.162 --> 24:56.095
Well, I'm sorry,
but it's not gonna be me.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.568
Even though red is
the obvious match

24:58.568 --> 25:00.399
for your skin tone.

25:02.672 --> 25:04.574
Hey, Chase, which one of
these outfits

25:04.574 --> 25:06.205
looks better on
Cardboard Leo,

25:06.205 --> 25:09.208
blue... or black?

25:09.208 --> 25:12.582
Why are you dressing up
Cardboard Leo?

25:12.582 --> 25:14.644
Hey, if I have to wear
a suit to the award ceremony,

25:14.644 --> 25:16.886
so does he.

25:16.886 --> 25:20.620
The joke's on you, because
we're both goin' commando.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.422
Adam, get rid of that thing.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.995
No. When Real Leo
watches from home,

25:25.995 --> 25:28.698
I want him to feel like
he's still a part of our team.

25:28.698 --> 25:31.260
Have you lost your mind?

25:31.260 --> 25:34.533
This is not our brother,
it's a piece of cardboard.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.166
No, it's four pieces
of cardboard,

25:37.166 --> 25:39.168
and I spent an extra
2.50 on the glossy finish,

25:39.168 --> 25:40.910
so you will respect him.

25:40.910 --> 25:42.511
I give up.

25:42.511 --> 25:44.143
Me, too.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.317
But go with the blue.

25:48.317 --> 25:50.549
It's all the rage
this season.

25:56.085 --> 25:59.158
So how'd you guys
get this thing
to the mainland?

25:59.158 --> 26:01.661
We had to helicopter it in
from the island.

26:01.661 --> 26:04.263
It was hung from
incredibly strong cables.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.535
The same ones they used
to pour Mr. Davenport

26:06.535 --> 26:07.867
into his tux pants.

26:07.867 --> 26:11.100
For your information,
I got into these pants

26:11.100 --> 26:13.042
without any help
from technology.

26:13.042 --> 26:15.444
It's true.
He used a girdle.

26:16.806 --> 26:19.979
And I had to tie it.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.480
And that thing did not
want to be tied.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.082
I have rope burns.

26:24.654 --> 26:27.486
Make some room
for Leo.

26:30.519 --> 26:32.692
Hey, watch the face.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.724
That's my money.

26:34.724 --> 26:36.565
I thought your brains
were your money.

26:36.565 --> 26:37.767
No, I mean actual money.

26:37.767 --> 26:40.569
I just had $50,000
worth of work done
to this thing.

26:43.132 --> 26:45.604
This thing could not
be more in the way.

26:45.604 --> 26:49.308
Exactly.
Just like the real Leo.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.811
Seatbelts, everyone.

26:54.213 --> 26:57.386
Drive to presidential
award ceremony.

26:57.386 --> 27:00.650
Whoa. This thing does
whatever you tell it to?

27:00.650 --> 27:02.451
Cool!

27:02.451 --> 27:04.593
- Pop a wheelie.
- ALL: No!

27:04.593 --> 27:06.756
It's okay.
It's okay.

27:06.756 --> 27:08.397
The first thing I taught
the computer

27:08.397 --> 27:11.060
was to tune out
Adam's voice.

27:13.002 --> 27:14.163
Pop a wheelie!

27:20.539 --> 27:22.812
I gotta hand it to you,
Mr. Davenport.

27:22.812 --> 27:25.344
This is the smoothest ride
I've ever been in.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.717
Yeah, you would never
know this thing doesn't
have a driver.

27:27.717 --> 27:29.779
The only thing that
gives it away

27:29.779 --> 27:32.121
is the look of sheer terror
on other people's faces

27:32.121 --> 27:34.123
as we pass by.

27:34.123 --> 27:37.426
Driver error is
the number-one cause
of car accidents.

27:37.426 --> 27:39.458
This little baby will make
automobile transportation

27:39.458 --> 27:41.230
a hundred times safer.

27:43.462 --> 27:44.834
Hey, what's it doing?

27:44.834 --> 27:47.296
Oh, the limo's computer's
plotting the location

27:47.296 --> 27:49.799
of the neighboring vehicles
and predicting their movement

27:49.799 --> 27:51.971
at 20 times a second.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.844
Blah, blah, blah.
Where's the butt warmers?

27:56.645 --> 27:58.708
In case of
an emergency,

27:58.708 --> 28:00.850
the entire vehicle
goes into lockdown.

28:00.850 --> 28:03.212
You are safer here
than anywhere in
the world.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.121
Oh, cool. We're going over
the Hurst Memorial bridge.

28:12.121 --> 28:13.692
Interesting fact.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.995
It's one of the largest
suspension bridges

28:15.995 --> 28:17.526
in the world.

28:17.526 --> 28:19.168
Erected in 1951
by a small group--

28:19.168 --> 28:20.830
Here's another
interesting fact.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.671
No one cares.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.305
- ( brakes screeching )
- What was that?

28:26.305 --> 28:28.207
I don't know.
Partition down.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.282
What's happening?

28:33.282 --> 28:34.844
The bridge cables
are snapping.

28:34.844 --> 28:37.286
- Put it up, put it up!
- Partition up.

28:41.350 --> 28:42.551
Everybody hold on.

28:52.461 --> 28:54.403
Is everybody okay?

28:54.403 --> 28:56.866
- Yeah.
- I'm a little
hungry, but...

28:58.868 --> 29:01.370
Why are we rocking?

29:01.370 --> 29:03.342
The limo must be
wedged over something.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.673
What do you think
it is?

29:04.673 --> 29:05.975
Partition down.

29:09.418 --> 29:11.921
Ooh, look.
Clouds.

29:11.921 --> 29:14.123
I didn't know
this thing could fly.

29:14.123 --> 29:18.127
Can I get a ginger ale
and a bag of peanuts?

29:18.127 --> 29:20.059
We're not flying.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.631
We're dangling
off the bridge!

29:37.306 --> 29:39.008
Okay, according to this,

29:39.008 --> 29:41.480
a transport ship
slammed into the bridge.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.483
If those cables keep snapping,
we're done for.

29:44.483 --> 29:47.256
Thanks for saying
what we're all seeing.

29:47.256 --> 29:51.620
I'm scared.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.592
That wasn't me.
That was Leo.

29:53.592 --> 29:56.625
Keep it together, Leo.

29:56.625 --> 29:58.828
We have to
get out of here.

29:58.828 --> 30:00.599
Why won't the doors open?

30:00.599 --> 30:02.471
The limo's computer
sensed the emergency

30:02.471 --> 30:04.633
and put the car into
immediate lockdown mode.

30:04.633 --> 30:07.276
Technology that makes it
impossible to get
inside the limo

30:07.276 --> 30:09.608
also makes it impossible
to get out.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.280
Even with our bionics?

30:11.280 --> 30:13.612
Yes, thanks to Douglas.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.814
Me? The limo was
your idea.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.746
Yeah, until you
ruined it.

30:17.746 --> 30:19.488
"I can break into your limo.
I'm a bad boy.

30:19.488 --> 30:22.091
I have spiked hair
and wear too many bracelets."

30:22.091 --> 30:25.424
Ask any guy who wears
bracelets and he'll tell you.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.926
Five is the perfect amount.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.758
Two is too few,
four needs one more. Ha!

30:29.758 --> 30:32.101
Guys, stop fighting.

30:32.101 --> 30:34.403
We have to get
out of here.

30:34.403 --> 30:36.605
I'm not just gonna
sit here all day.
I'm busting us out.

30:38.868 --> 30:42.371
Everyone stop moving.

30:48.277 --> 30:49.718
Stay calm, Donnie.

30:49.718 --> 30:52.151
We'll figure a way
out of this.

30:52.151 --> 30:55.254
It's not that.
I gotta figure a way
out of this girdle.

30:57.086 --> 30:59.088
Oh, no. If that thing
bursts,

30:59.088 --> 31:01.991
it'll take us out
before the bridge does.

31:07.766 --> 31:09.398
It's bad.

31:09.398 --> 31:11.670
There are still tons of
civilians on that bridge.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.502
We've got to rescue them.

31:15.244 --> 31:17.876
Wait. That's
Mr. Davenport's limo.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.979
Adam, Bree and Chase
must be trapped inside,

31:19.979 --> 31:22.481
or they would've started
the rescue by now.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.383
Listen up, guys.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.315
I know you've never
been on a mission,

31:26.315 --> 31:28.087
but you can do this.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.659
Get moving.
I'll send the coordinates.

31:30.659 --> 31:32.661
What are we gonna do?

31:32.661 --> 31:35.164
We're gonna call Leo.

31:38.327 --> 31:39.798
Can't talk, Big D.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.500
The crème brulée was such
a big hit last night,

31:41.500 --> 31:43.472
the book club gals
came back for lunch.

31:43.472 --> 31:44.833
Omelet up, Betty.

31:44.833 --> 31:47.176
Wait. He can cook?

31:47.176 --> 31:49.108
Is there anything
this guy can't do?

31:51.480 --> 31:52.881
Taylor.

31:52.881 --> 31:54.843
It's good to see you.

31:54.843 --> 31:56.986
I heard you've
been training.

31:56.986 --> 31:58.817
Forget about me.

31:58.817 --> 32:00.990
There's been a horrible accident
with your family's limo.

32:00.990 --> 32:02.551
What? Where?

32:02.551 --> 32:04.523
The Hurst Memorial bridge.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.755
The limo's barely
hanging on.

32:06.755 --> 32:09.728
I know you quit the team,
but your family needs you.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.830
Okay, I'll meet you
both there.

32:11.830 --> 32:13.662
Wait. I'm not going.

32:13.662 --> 32:15.464
Why not?

32:15.464 --> 32:16.735
I can't see.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.237
I'd just be in the way.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.069
Do you have any idea
how many times

32:20.069 --> 32:21.640
I've been in the way
on a mission?

32:21.640 --> 32:24.413
Yeah. Chase told me.
31 1/2

32:25.814 --> 32:27.916
Look, you're not gonna
be in the way.

32:27.916 --> 32:29.448
You've still got
a lot to offer,

32:29.448 --> 32:31.981
- and I need your help.
- I don't know.

32:31.981 --> 32:35.124
Don't worry. We're gonna
make it through this together.

32:35.124 --> 32:36.825
All three of us.

32:36.825 --> 32:39.388
All right.
Let's do it.

32:44.393 --> 32:46.395
If I can find a way
to shut down the computer,

32:46.395 --> 32:49.268
the limo will
terminate lockdown mode.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.900
Have you tried overriding
the security architecture?

32:51.900 --> 32:54.403
What about jailbreaking
the cryptographic interface?

32:54.403 --> 32:56.745
What about
the off button?

32:58.177 --> 33:01.710
I don't think he's
taking us very seriously, Leo.

33:01.710 --> 33:05.254
Stop talking
to cardboard!

33:09.758 --> 33:12.321
Don't move.

33:12.321 --> 33:14.623
Every time you do,
we're one step closer

33:14.623 --> 33:16.425
to plummeting
to our death

33:16.425 --> 33:19.628
Just stay still.

33:21.530 --> 33:24.703
- I have to sneeze.
- Can you hold it?

33:24.703 --> 33:26.135
No.

33:27.976 --> 33:29.138
Pinch her nose!

33:47.956 --> 33:49.458
Sorry I'm late.

33:49.458 --> 33:50.999
I was in such a rush,
I went to the wrong bridge.

33:50.999 --> 33:54.803
You'll be happy to know all is
well on the Norcal connector.

33:54.803 --> 33:57.436
That's the last
of the civilians.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.439
Get them off the bridge
and set up the triage area.

34:02.211 --> 34:03.742
Where's the limo?

34:03.742 --> 34:05.244
Over there.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.487
Oh. Good idea,
Mr. Davenport.

34:18.487 --> 34:20.789
Turn on a good movie to
take our minds off

34:20.789 --> 34:22.491
this tragic situation.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.034
Looks like
an action flick.

34:26.034 --> 34:27.966
That's not a movie;
that's us.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.038
No, it's not.

34:30.038 --> 34:32.201
If this were real life,
the car would move
when I do this.

34:35.103 --> 34:38.877
Okay, it's real.
It's real!

34:40.449 --> 34:43.351
That's Leo.
He came to save us.

34:45.353 --> 34:46.855
Leo, can you hear me?

34:46.855 --> 34:49.257
- Leo.
 - Yes, Big D.,
 I can hear you.

34:49.257 --> 34:51.760
- We're coming to get you.
- No.

34:51.760 --> 34:54.523
It's too unstable.
I don't want you
to get hurt.

34:54.523 --> 34:56.625
Listen to me
 very carefully.

34:56.625 --> 34:58.727
We're locked in.

34:58.727 --> 35:01.330
See that silver shark fin
on the rear windshield?

35:04.433 --> 35:05.904
I see it.

35:05.904 --> 35:08.637
That's the housing unit
for the computer system.

35:08.637 --> 35:11.680
I need you to find a way
to disable it.

35:11.680 --> 35:14.443
Then it will
release the locks,
and we can climb out.

35:14.443 --> 35:15.684
Got it.

35:15.684 --> 35:17.346
They can do this.

35:17.346 --> 35:19.148
Right?

35:19.148 --> 35:20.989
What do you think?

35:20.989 --> 35:23.352
Our lives are in the hands
of a newbie, a quitter,

35:23.352 --> 35:24.923
and a blind girl.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.427
We can still
hear you!

35:28.427 --> 35:33.262
Then, boy,
aren't we lucky?

35:33.262 --> 35:34.963
We gotta figure out
a way

35:34.963 --> 35:36.605
to disable
that computer system.

35:43.111 --> 35:45.444
Wait. Our EMP ability.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.446
It disables any
electrical charge.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.248
If we generate a sphere,
then Logan can guide it

35:49.248 --> 35:50.619
to take out
the limo's computer.

35:50.619 --> 35:52.251
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

35:58.427 --> 35:59.528
Keep going.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.374
What's the matter?
Why'd you stop?

36:15.374 --> 36:17.376
I can't do this.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.608
What if I hurt you again?

36:19.608 --> 36:21.380
What if I hurt them?

36:21.380 --> 36:23.782
I don't wanna ruin
anyone else's life.

36:23.782 --> 36:27.886
Leo, you didn't
ruin my life.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.958
It was an accident.

36:29.958 --> 36:33.091
And if I'm not gonna
let it stop me from
being a bionic hero,

36:33.091 --> 36:34.663
why should you?

36:41.370 --> 36:43.402
This is it, Leo.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.873
This is your chance to prove

36:44.873 --> 36:46.505
you're the leader
I know you are.

36:48.076 --> 36:50.839
So... are you in?

36:52.511 --> 36:55.484
Yeah. I'm in.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.321
What's wrong?

37:04.593 --> 37:05.824
Duck!

37:11.260 --> 37:12.931
How'd you know
that was gonna happen?

37:12.931 --> 37:15.664
I heard the sound wave
of the cable when it snapped.

37:15.664 --> 37:17.105
Ever since I lost my sight,

37:17.105 --> 37:18.807
all of my other senses
have increased.

37:18.807 --> 37:21.610
- Really?
- Hello.

37:21.610 --> 37:24.212
Sliding off a bridge
over here!

37:25.444 --> 37:27.576
Hang on.
We have a plan.

37:27.576 --> 37:30.349
Based on the last 40 times
that he said that,

37:30.349 --> 37:33.982
I'd say we have, oh, a ten
percent chance of making it.

37:33.982 --> 37:37.025
Hey, hey, he came
all the way out here

37:37.025 --> 37:38.887
to save us.
Give the kid some credit.

37:38.887 --> 37:41.360
Twelve percent.

37:42.391 --> 37:44.533
We can still hear you.

37:44.533 --> 37:47.866
Taylor, give me
your hand.

37:56.305 --> 37:58.276
Little more.

38:06.555 --> 38:08.056
Okay, Logan,
on my cue,

38:08.056 --> 38:10.359
aim the sphere at
that silver fin.

38:10.359 --> 38:11.520
Got it.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.626
Trust me.
We got this.

38:29.838 --> 38:32.210
All right, Logan.
Now.

38:44.292 --> 38:46.395
They did it.
Let's get outta here.

38:46.395 --> 38:48.256
- Yes!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:48.256 --> 38:50.158
Single file, people.

38:50.158 --> 38:52.130
Me first.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.466
Wait, wait, wait.
Open the sun roof.

38:57.466 --> 38:59.508
Bree can super-speed
us out one by one.

39:02.571 --> 39:04.242
Let's go.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.434
Chase!

39:28.066 --> 39:29.938
We have to go now.

39:29.938 --> 39:31.369
The whole bridge
is about to go down.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.772
I'll get Chase. You guys get
everyone else out of here.

39:33.772 --> 39:36.044
- Leo, we can...
- There's no time! Go!

39:36.044 --> 39:37.776
Grab on.

39:58.226 --> 40:01.369
Leo, you have to let go,
or it's gonna take you with it.

40:01.369 --> 40:02.731
I'm not letting go.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.381
Give me your hand.

41:08.296 --> 41:10.769
Wow! Leo, you did it.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.601
You saved my life.

41:12.601 --> 41:14.773
Sorry I ever doubted you.

41:14.773 --> 41:16.945
I'm just glad
you're okay.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.980
Wait, there's someone
floating in the water.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.083
Is that me?

41:25.083 --> 41:27.916
Don't worry.
That's just cardboard you.

41:27.916 --> 41:29.918
Trust me,
he wasn't worth saving.

41:36.925 --> 41:39.628
These individuals
before you

41:39.628 --> 41:43.101
are the epitome
of what a hero should be.

41:43.101 --> 41:46.304
Itchy, itchy,
 itchy, itchy.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.807
Why didn't I
 wear underwear?

41:48.807 --> 41:51.279
They are the most selfless,

41:51.279 --> 41:53.481
humble people
that I know.

41:53.481 --> 41:57.085
My face is on
 every channel.

41:57.085 --> 42:00.318
Melissa Finnegan
 is so jealous right now.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.821
Because of their
courageous actions,

42:02.821 --> 42:05.253
the world
is a better place.

42:05.253 --> 42:08.827
I'm gonna take
 your job.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.659
I'm gonna be
 president someday.

42:10.659 --> 42:14.332
This place will be mine.
 All mine.

42:14.332 --> 42:17.666
Heroes come in
all shapes and sizes,

42:17.666 --> 42:20.208
but the real way
to measure a true hero

42:20.208 --> 42:24.743
is by their determination
to never give up.

42:24.743 --> 42:28.747
( applause )

42:28.747 --> 42:31.249
If I didn't have to go
 to the bathroom so badly,

42:31.249 --> 42:33.922
I might actually
 be enjoying this.

42:33.922 --> 42:36.324
People of our nation,

42:36.324 --> 42:38.426
and our planet,

42:38.426 --> 42:41.089
are beyond grateful
for the contributions

42:41.089 --> 42:43.832
that you four have made
to our safety and well-being.

42:43.832 --> 42:46.635
There is no way we can repay you
for all that you've done.

42:46.635 --> 42:50.699
Well, don't let that stop you
from writing a big, fat check.

42:53.171 --> 42:56.004
Did I just say that
out loud?

42:57.606 --> 42:59.648
Oh, good, I didn't.

43:07.015 --> 43:09.788
Listen up, everybody.

43:09.788 --> 43:12.390
Someone very special
is rejoining the team.

43:20.729 --> 43:22.801
Whoa.

43:22.801 --> 43:25.573
I was expecting
someone completely different.

43:25.573 --> 43:28.476
Not only is Leo
back at the island,

43:28.476 --> 43:30.108
but because of his
bravery and leadership

43:30.108 --> 43:31.640
on the bridge mission,

43:31.640 --> 43:34.082
I have officially
made him a mentor.

43:39.117 --> 43:41.489
Couldn't be prouder
of you, buddy.

43:44.152 --> 43:46.324
Congrats, Mr. Mentor.

43:46.324 --> 43:47.325
And thanks.

43:47.325 --> 43:48.897
For what?

43:48.897 --> 43:51.830
I didn't think I'd ever
go on a mission again, Leo.

43:51.830 --> 43:53.601
But you changed all that.

43:53.601 --> 43:56.064
I'm the one who should
be thanking you.

43:56.064 --> 43:58.536
You showed me
I really am a leader.

44:01.910 --> 44:04.142
I love you guys.

44:06.544 --> 44:08.747
( crying )

44:08.747 --> 44:10.578
Are you crying?

44:11.880 --> 44:13.551
No.

44:15.553 --> 44:18.887
I'm just allergic
to happiness.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.732
Come on, you old softie.
Now that everybody's safe,

44:23.732 --> 44:25.964
you can help me
out of this girdle.

44:27.836 --> 44:33.972
ALL: Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo,
Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo!
