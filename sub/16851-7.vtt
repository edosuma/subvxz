(male narrator)
 Previously on
 Childrens Hospital..

00:03.637 --> 00:04.638
Remember the Childrens
 Hospital doctors

00:04.672 --> 00:06.440
Lola and her boyfriend, Glenn?

00:06.474 --> 00:07.575
Glenn's a guy that fools around
 with everyone but Lola.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.710
So Lola's taken up with Brian.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.545
Children's Hospital's black
 heart surgeon, who's been

00:11.579 --> 00:13.647
busy with Lola's best friend,
 Valerie.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.050
Lola doesn't know
 Brian's been busy with Valerie

00:16.084 --> 00:17.718
and that Glenn's been
 busy with everyone.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.388
So Lola spends some awkward
 moments with Cat.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.156
Valerie Flame sure's
 a classy lady.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.458
There's Cat. She swears
 she once saw a ghost.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.494
Maybe she just saw Owen.
 He's really pale.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.329
This is hospital administrator
 Sy Mittleman

00:28.362 --> 00:30.164
speaking at one of his
 laughter conventions.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.499
This paramedic's afraid
 of doors.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.201
Don't go through that door!

00:33.234 --> 00:34.602
There's the Childrens
 Hospital garden.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.437
So lush and full,
 teeming with life.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.272
Great job, Andrew.
 Then there's this room.

00:38.306 --> 00:40.108
It's got a toilet,
 some toilet paper

00:40.141 --> 00:41.409
a clown eating a burrito.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.511
These doctors
 are having a good time.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.613
And this guy's like,
 "Hey, I'm confident."

00:45.646 --> 00:48.316
Here's a kid. There's another.
 She's looking into the camera.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.518
Oh, look! That dog
 can stand up.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.621
All this and more on this
 week's Childrens Hospital.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.089
[theme music]

00:57.725 --> 00:59.627
[cell door closes]

01:01.195 --> 01:02.530
Happy Birthday, kid.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.197
You finally turned 18.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.866
Now they're allowed
to execute you.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.402
So...my sympathies.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.507
(Valerie)
'Happy Birthday,
Erica.'

01:13.541 --> 01:15.343
We found a heart donor for you.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.611
If everything goes well
with the transplant, you'll have

01:17.645 --> 01:19.447
a healthy new heart
by this afternoon.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.749
It's going to be
an 18th birthday to remember.

01:21.782 --> 01:27.255
Yeah, whether she lives or dies.
Especially if she dies. See ya.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.722
(female on intercom)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

01:28.756 --> 01:30.758
'Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta.'

01:30.791 --> 01:33.561
This transplant better
arrive soon.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.630
The charter only allows us
to treat minors, Val.

01:36.664 --> 01:39.633
And this kid turns eighteen
at 2 o'clock today.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.336
After that...
we kick her out.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.837
But couldn't we
make an exception?

01:43.871 --> 01:45.839
We're talking
a matter of minutes.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.142
Once we start playing
loosey-goosey with the charter

01:48.176 --> 01:49.577
things will snowball.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.512
Look what happened
to Nazi Germany.

01:51.545 --> 01:54.215
No, Val.
Not on my watch.

01:54.248 --> 01:57.318
- Well, I just hope--
- Not on my watch.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.487
- Well, I--
- Not..

01:59.520 --> 02:01.655
- I just hope the heart--
- ...On..

02:01.689 --> 02:03.757
- I just hope the heart gets--
- ..my watch.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.359
Dismissed.

02:05.393 --> 02:08.496
I just hope the heart
gets here in time.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.764
- Morning, guys.
- Good morning.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.767
I'm working a double today.
Does anybody want a ride?

02:13.801 --> 02:16.404
You've to work a double
on Father's Day? That's awful.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.705
You cancelled plans with dad?

02:17.738 --> 02:19.707
I'm taking dad
to see Love Letters

02:19.740 --> 02:21.342
with Cathy Rigby
and Zach Braff.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.177
So the four of you
are going?

02:23.211 --> 02:24.412
I don't celebrate
Father's Day.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.846
You don't believe
in fathers?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.815
Where do you think
babies come from?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.950
- She must mean metaphorically.
- How's that a metaphor?

02:29.983 --> 02:34.955
Example. "The storm cloud is a
roaring lion guarding its prey."

02:34.988 --> 02:37.558
Now, if I had said
"like a roaring lion"..

02:37.591 --> 02:39.760
...that would be a..
Brian?

02:39.793 --> 02:42.463
- Um, simile?
- 'Very good, Brian.'

02:42.496 --> 02:43.931
Okay, guys.
A quiz tomorrow.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.966
I want everyone
to look at chapter 3.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.503
Look, I haven't seen my dad
since I was a little girl, okay?

02:49.537 --> 02:51.472
Let's just leave it at that.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.208
[door closes]

02:54.242 --> 02:55.309
What a tragedy.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.345
As her friends,
we owe it to her

02:57.378 --> 03:00.648
to track down her dad,
and to bring him to her.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.550
Let's spend
time doing that.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.651
Mm-hmm.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.787
Good morning, my
pee-meisters.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.923
Look at this. We only have
200 more gallons of urine

03:09.957 --> 03:11.759
in order to reach
this year's goal.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.828
What does that remind you of?
Let your pee-pee do the pee-pee.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.531
You're a babbling brook.
A warm babbling brook.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.967
Put your hand right in here.
Does that feel good?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.303
[groans in pleasure]

03:22.336 --> 03:25.306
I have to go.
I'm peeing.

03:26.974 --> 03:30.678
I need help in room four. Quick.
Patient is in arrest.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.212
On it.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.749
[gasping]

03:35.783 --> 03:37.451
What are you doing?

03:37.485 --> 03:39.720
- What's going on?
- There's no patient.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.890
- Cat, say hello to your father.
- Surprise!

03:42.923 --> 03:46.360
Yeah. Cat, we found your dad.
Don't you love us?

03:46.394 --> 03:49.029
- This is not my father.
- That's not my daughter.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.300
Haven't seen her in a long time
but I know she's black.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.702
That's something you could've
mentioned in the pre-interview.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.706
How did we mess
that one up?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.874
(Blake)
Hey, Val. They're
about to execute him.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.377
When they do, I'll
slice out his black heart

04:03.411 --> 04:05.813
and bring it.
I don't want that kid to die.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.381
Hi. How are you?

04:07.415 --> 04:10.651
No, no. This kid I do want
to die, quickly.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.486
Hey, are you
moving slowly on purpose?

04:12.520 --> 04:15.823
Because, uh, I got your number,
alright?

04:15.856 --> 04:18.459
Wow. He's milking this one.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.628
You got any last words, son?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.596
Um, yeah.

04:22.630 --> 04:26.800
Now, I want to say, I'm sorry
to the families of my victims.

04:26.834 --> 04:30.371
I know that there's
never a reason for murder

04:30.404 --> 04:33.741
even less of an excuse when
the victim was such a good man.

04:33.774 --> 04:38.011
Still less when it was many
dozens of victims, each..

04:38.045 --> 04:39.980
...killed for no
particular reason.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.883
And then you add to that
they're a collection of..

04:42.916 --> 04:46.754
...honor students and peaceful
volunteers and..

04:46.787 --> 04:50.524
...doctors without borders,
Jerry of Ben Jerry's..

04:50.558 --> 04:53.394
[monitor beeping]

04:53.427 --> 04:55.396
I really hope that heart
gets here--

04:55.429 --> 04:56.664
(Chief)
Not on my watch.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.799
- I really hope the heart--
- Not.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.969
- I really hope the heart--
- No.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.771
- I really hope that heart--
- My watch.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.477
Oh, Dr. Maestro, don't
forget the urine drive today.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.112
We need every last drop
if we're gonna make our goal.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.814
I don't think I can.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.849
Just got my navel's pierced,
so I'm disqualified.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.918
Plus, I've AIDS.
What's with the roller skates?

05:17.951 --> 05:19.953
I have this tray
of uncovered urine samples

05:19.987 --> 05:22.122
I've to bring to Sy
and I figured

05:22.155 --> 05:23.924
it would be faster
on skates.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.859
I don't think
that's a good idea.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.095
You're nine months pregnant
and they waxed the floor

05:28.128 --> 05:30.631
plus some kids spilled
a bucket of marbles there.

05:30.664 --> 05:35.102
What could possibly
go wrong?

05:35.135 --> 05:36.136
[beep]

05:36.169 --> 05:37.805
Classic Dori.

05:37.838 --> 05:41.108
It's just like senior prom
all over again.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.876
(female on intercom)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

05:42.910 --> 05:45.112
'I'm not the regular announcer.
That's all.'

05:45.145 --> 05:46.814
Cat, great news.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.919
This is your biological dad.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.621
What is wrong with you guys?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.889
This is the same guy
from before.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.124
God dammit!

05:57.157 --> 05:59.159
Cat, we-we screwed up again.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.161
Brian, I think this is your dad.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.865
Right. That's right.
Happy Father's Day, Pop.

06:04.898 --> 06:05.899
Thanks, Bri.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.436
When are you gonna stop this?

06:08.469 --> 06:09.537
No, don't you worry!

06:09.570 --> 06:10.871
We will never stop this!

06:10.904 --> 06:13.173
When you get down to it
it's like..

06:13.206 --> 06:16.777
...what is life but just
a collection of moments?

06:16.810 --> 06:20.581
We've explored more of our moon
than our own oceans.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.417
Hmm? Oceans truly
are the last frontier.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.890
Oh, you're still here.
You know what?

06:29.923 --> 06:31.725
We're not gonna make it.

06:31.759 --> 06:35.062
Oh! I wrung my clothes out,
but I only got about a liter.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.864
I am so sorry, Sy.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.766
Oh, it's not your fault
that you

06:38.799 --> 06:41.769
ran into a tray of urine while
pregnant wearing roller-skates.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.671
It could happen to no one.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.907
You know what?
Just shut down the urine drive.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.909
- Wait! Wait! I have an idea.
- Yeah.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.512
- We'd get Owen to donate.
- Doesn't he have AIDS?

06:51.545 --> 06:52.980
- We could try anyway.
- Okay, fine.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.515
- Okay.
- Try that.

06:54.548 --> 06:58.752
The oceans, and fish,
deep-dish pizzas.

06:58.786 --> 07:02.122
Baba booey! Baba booey!
Howard Stern's penis!

07:02.155 --> 07:03.223
[gas hissing]

07:03.256 --> 07:06.126
[machinery clicking ]

07:06.159 --> 07:08.095
[exhales sharply]

07:08.128 --> 07:09.963
[clapping]

07:09.997 --> 07:13.200
Great execution, guys.
I'm being sarcastic.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.869
Cat, could you come in here?

07:15.903 --> 07:17.905
The man in that room
is your father.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.239
What? Oh. Hey, pop!

07:19.272 --> 07:21.241
- Happy Father's Day.
- Thanks, Bri.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.111
[monitors beeping]

07:24.144 --> 07:26.013
Got the heart.
Finally.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.482
Great. Let's work fast
before Chief cuts us off.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.618
Time's up, everybody.
Instruments down.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.820
I said, instruments down!

07:32.853 --> 07:35.222
As of this moment, this
patient's not a minor

07:35.255 --> 07:36.790
and therefore, trespassing.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.527
Get her out of here
or I'm calling security.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.961
Happy Birthday, kid.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.030
Ha ha! Chloroform!

07:45.699 --> 07:47.935
- She's out.
- Let's cut.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.271
Wait. Hold it! Before you do,
Owen, I need your pee.

07:51.304 --> 07:56.076
Look, I can't, okay?
I get pee-sick.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.078
Alright, I was born
without a bladder.

07:58.111 --> 08:01.749
God! What do you guys want?
I'm scared of needles, okay?

08:01.782 --> 08:04.084
I'm a grown man,
and I'm scared of needles!

08:04.117 --> 08:06.520
I'm sorry!
Are you happy?

08:06.554 --> 08:08.956
There are no needles.
You pee in a cup.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.892
- Oh, let's do it that way.
- Come on. Carry on.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.897
(Valerie)
 We all deserve a second
 chance.'

08:19.900 --> 08:20.968
No.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.537
Not on my watch.
Not on my..

08:23.571 --> 08:25.606
[grunts]

08:25.639 --> 08:28.175
(Valerie)
 Second chances are just
 first chances

08:28.208 --> 08:30.844
plus another chance.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.681
Speaking of chances,
 Cat decided she was

08:33.714 --> 08:37.083
finally ready to take
 one herself.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.986
Hey, dad.
Happy Father's day.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.221
Yeah. I'll meet you there
in an hour, okay?

08:41.254 --> 08:44.057
She was finally ready to
 come clean about her father.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.894
Turns out he was closer
 than we could ever have known.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.829
I'll meet you there.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.865
Oh, this is gonna be
a very special Father's Day.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.572
Sometimes, a second chance
 comes in the form

08:58.606 --> 09:00.307
of someone else's heart.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.810
Does it matter
 that the heart once belonged

09:02.843 --> 09:04.778
to a serial murderer?

09:04.812 --> 09:06.914
Yeah, I-I would say
 definitely, yeah.

09:06.947 --> 09:10.317
And children all over the world
 got a second chance

09:10.350 --> 09:14.221
to have the urine
 they so desperately needed.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.657
- Happy Father's Day, Daddy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.196
Did you get a hold of that
heroin I was asking about?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.264
Yes.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.201
Were you able
to find my daughter?

09:28.235 --> 09:30.103
I sure did.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.639
And she's here.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.680
Brian's father...is my daughter?

09:39.713 --> 09:41.114
Yup.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.785
Samantha..

09:47.420 --> 09:48.956
I missed you, daddy.

09:50.858 --> 09:55.095
* My father says a soldier

09:55.128 --> 10:00.267
* Is someone with
an inner strength *

10:00.300 --> 10:02.202
[regurgitating]

10:06.006 --> 10:09.376
Baby..

10:09.409 --> 10:11.278
Is that it?

10:11.311 --> 10:13.847
[regurgitating]

10:13.881 --> 10:17.017
Let me help you with that. There
you go. Okay, breathe. Alright.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.853
- Thanks, dad.
- Thank you.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.656
* But I know

10:22.690 --> 10:28.028
* There's something good in me

10:28.061 --> 10:30.397
* There's something good in me

10:30.430 --> 10:32.265
(female on intercom )
'Attention, hospital staff.'

10:32.299 --> 10:34.868
'Don't look a gift
horse in the mouth.'

10:34.902 --> 10:37.705
'Seriously, gift horses
are very dangerous.'

10:37.738 --> 10:40.373
[imitating Chief]
'Cause I'm Chief
and I'm club-footed

10:40.407 --> 10:43.443
I can't get some action.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.080
- But now I can.
- Wait a minute. What?

10:47.114 --> 10:49.016
Valerie!

10:49.049 --> 10:50.083
