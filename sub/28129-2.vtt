00:51.265 --> 00:54.145
They're coming for me.
I know they're coming for me.

00:54.185 --> 00:56.332
They've shut down all my accounts.
I can't get online.

00:56.372 --> 00:57.694
I can't do anything.

00:57.734 --> 01:01.722
Roman, if you're watching this,
then you've got the files.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.855
We have to get you somewhere safe,
somewhere far away from here.

01:04.894 --> 01:06.123
How are we gonna do that, Dad?

01:06.163 --> 01:08.825
The first thing we have to do,
Roman, is delete all these files.

01:08.865 --> 01:10.975
Then you have to destroy
this computer...

01:11.015 --> 01:13.025
It won't make a difference.
They'll track me down.

01:13.065 --> 01:15.175
Then we'll have to move faster
than they do, all right?

01:15.215 --> 01:18.284
We'll figure it out, Roman.
We'll figure it out, I promise you.

01:18.324 --> 01:21.825
But first get rid of that data
and do not talk to anyone.

01:21.865 --> 01:23.505
What about Mum?

01:23.545 --> 01:25.745
Er... you... you leave Mum to me.

01:27.865 --> 01:29.905
Gosh, Mum, I did.

01:37.065 --> 01:38.665
All right.

01:54.265 --> 01:56.265
Just be careful, Roman.

01:56.305 --> 01:58.593
Let him do his business
and come straight back.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.505
All right, Mum.

02:13.585 --> 02:17.104
Whoo, yeah!

02:30.746 --> 02:32.546
It's pretty crazy, right?

02:33.785 --> 02:36.065
So, are you part of the race?

02:36.105 --> 02:37.545
Sure.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.225
Race yourself free, right?

02:40.965 --> 02:43.341
Well... good luck.

02:57.768 --> 02:59.768
- Roadkill!
- That's Roadkill!

03:02.947 --> 03:05.545
Man, look, look!
Look, that's Roadkill!

03:05.585 --> 03:10.145
Roadkill!
Roadkill! Roadkill! Roadkill!

03:16.385 --> 03:18.625
Forgetting something?

03:18.665 --> 03:20.979
Kaye. Keys.

03:21.745 --> 03:23.665
Not gonna get very far
without them.

03:23.705 --> 03:25.545
Change of plan.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.705
- I'm driving.
- Uh...

03:28.745 --> 03:29.996
Seriously?

03:30.036 --> 03:32.876
Looks like you could use
all the help you can get.

03:34.105 --> 03:35.665
Yeah.

03:49.785 --> 03:52.338
Brutus! What are you doing?
Come here!

04:06.265 --> 04:08.265
I had a dog.

04:09.905 --> 04:11.665
His name was Bob.

04:11.705 --> 04:13.665
Best friend I ever had.

04:14.865 --> 04:19.625
He used to sneak up into my room
at night and curl up next to me.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.545
My Dad...

04:27.345 --> 04:29.025
...he didn't like that.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.987
My Dad didn't like Bob much at all.

04:33.099 --> 04:35.099
He died when I was 14.

04:35.945 --> 04:38.176
Your dog or your...

04:38.216 --> 04:39.656
Bob.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.625
My Dad caught me feeding him
under the table.

04:43.220 --> 04:46.100
Hit him so hard,
he lost the use of his back legs.

04:47.984 --> 04:50.361
He said he was gonna
put him out of his misery.

04:51.436 --> 04:54.919
So that night, Bob and I,
we ran away.

04:56.035 --> 04:58.436
He didn't make...

04:58.476 --> 05:00.436
He didn't make it very far.

05:01.265 --> 05:02.745
My dad was right.

05:03.214 --> 05:05.789
When he died,
it was kind of a relief...

05:07.210 --> 05:09.210
...not to see him suffer
any more.

05:13.243 --> 05:15.563
But I never went back.

05:17.956 --> 05:19.596
Well...

05:19.636 --> 05:22.558
...I guess it's good
that something positive

05:22.598 --> 05:25.198
came out of what must have been
a very difficult time.

05:28.665 --> 05:30.945
You know you've got no chance
out there?

05:31.825 --> 05:32.985
Right.

05:33.025 --> 05:35.349
You know, at some stage...

05:36.745 --> 05:38.385
...you're gonna die.

05:39.225 --> 05:40.785
I don't think that's true.

05:40.825 --> 05:42.941
You're all gonna die.

05:45.185 --> 05:46.545
But er...

05:47.723 --> 05:49.723
...you're gonna do it anyway.

05:50.825 --> 05:52.185
Good for you.

06:05.410 --> 06:07.345
Watch it, kid.

06:22.781 --> 06:24.821
Listen to that, eh?

06:24.861 --> 06:30.267
That is one 5.3 litre, V-12,
fuel-injected beast of an engine.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.286
You know what its top speed is?
Guess.

06:32.326 --> 06:33.865
184?

06:33.905 --> 06:35.604
210.

06:35.644 --> 06:37.451
- Yeah.
- I timed it myself.

06:37.491 --> 06:40.305
All them Porches and Ferraris,
nowhere near as fast.

06:40.345 --> 06:41.388
Nowhere near.

06:41.428 --> 06:43.745
It's not just about the speed,
though, is it?

06:43.785 --> 06:45.625
Did I say that it was?
I didn't say that.

06:45.665 --> 06:47.564
You're putting words
in my mouth.

06:47.604 --> 06:50.885
I'm not here to pick a fight.
I wanted to clear the air.

06:50.925 --> 06:52.555
You mean that thing
with the cops?

06:52.602 --> 06:54.872
All I did was give them the address.
I'm sorry about that.

06:54.911 --> 06:57.188
Of course I am.
Nothing personal.

06:58.796 --> 07:02.685
What do you say we put it behind us,
let bygones be bygones, eh?

07:02.725 --> 07:04.245
Sure.

07:04.285 --> 07:06.245
All right.

07:07.085 --> 07:09.285
You take care of yourself
out there.

07:09.325 --> 07:11.425
You too. Let the best man win.

07:14.805 --> 07:16.805
What did he have to say that for?

07:17.485 --> 07:19.969
Say what?
He didn't say anything.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.525
"Let the best man win,"
by which he means him.

07:22.565 --> 07:25.765
So he's saying he's the best man,
like I'm a piece of shit?

07:25.805 --> 07:28.419
It's just a turn of phrase, baby.

07:29.514 --> 07:32.174
Don't turn it into something, OK?

07:33.065 --> 07:34.785
You promised.

07:35.721 --> 07:36.881
Yeah.

07:41.805 --> 07:46.072
'Please return to your vehicles.
The race will commence in three minutes.'

07:46.134 --> 07:48.445
- Come on, Brutus.
- Roman, where have you been?

07:48.485 --> 07:50.365
The race is about to start.

07:50.405 --> 07:53.886
Ow! Roman, seriously,
what is wrong with you?

07:53.926 --> 07:55.365
The dog stays on your side.

07:55.405 --> 07:58.525
Whatever you're rattling on about,
it's not as important as this.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.325
The race is about to start

08:00.365 --> 08:03.085
and everything we need to know
is in there.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.365
Somewhere.

08:04.565 --> 08:06.845
Dad really didn't
like computers, did he?

08:06.885 --> 08:08.525
Analogue's safer.

08:08.565 --> 08:10.928
You can't hack into its folder
and wipe its hard drive.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.165
Your father spent weeks
working on that file.

08:13.205 --> 08:15.285
He knew the race was
heading north so he...

08:15.325 --> 08:17.885
...he figured out a specific plan
for every eventuality

08:17.925 --> 08:19.925
how to get across the river,

08:19.965 --> 08:21.405
how to get through the wall.

08:21.445 --> 08:23.205
He had a plan for everything.

08:23.245 --> 08:27.234
Yeah. And he also had really,
really small handwriting.

08:31.485 --> 08:34.445
'The race will
commence in two minutes.'

08:34.485 --> 08:35.765
Sorry.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.765
If we hadn't have come round...

08:42.125 --> 08:44.125
Don't worry. It's fine.

08:44.765 --> 08:47.565
Getting Michael to the island
is all that matters right now.

08:49.042 --> 08:51.245
So, we are number 21.

08:51.285 --> 08:53.245
It's lucky, isn't it?

08:54.245 --> 08:56.005
Everything OK?

08:56.045 --> 08:59.085
Kaye was just saying how important
it is to get you to the island.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.285
Yeah, yeah. Well, that's
why we're here, right?

09:07.005 --> 09:09.925
It's the co-ordinates
for the finish line.

09:18.445 --> 09:20.045
The end of the fucking world.

09:20.765 --> 09:22.805
That's over 1,000 kilometres.

09:22.845 --> 09:25.125
'The race will
commence in one minute.'

09:25.165 --> 09:27.005
Well, let's get cosy.

09:28.365 --> 09:30.485
Cos it's gonna be a long night.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.485
'Take a look around you right now."

09:41.525 --> 09:45.045
'There's one thing everyone who's
come out here tonight has in common:

09:45.765 --> 09:47.005
defiance.'

09:47.045 --> 09:48.805
'But it's more than that.'

09:48.845 --> 09:50.525
'You didn't just opt out...

09:50.565 --> 09:53.605
...of the creatures and the curfew...

09:53.645 --> 09:56.636
of the rules and restrictions
that come with it.'

09:56.885 --> 09:59.313
'No. You went further than that.'

09:59.353 --> 10:00.885
'You opted in.'

10:00.925 --> 10:03.285
'Now, nothing about
the race is easy.'

10:03.325 --> 10:05.165
'But it is going to be worth it.'

10:05.205 --> 10:08.565
'Cos at the end of tonight,
one team is gonna come with me

10:08.605 --> 10:11.805
to a place where
you can sit out at night

10:11.845 --> 10:13.645
and gaze up at the stars.'

10:14.325 --> 10:16.085
'A place without creatures.'

10:16.125 --> 10:17.765
'A place with hope.'

10:18.485 --> 10:20.565
'Good luck, people.'

10:20.605 --> 10:22.565
'Race yourselves free.'

10:23.805 --> 10:25.845
'Ten...'

10:25.885 --> 10:27.589
Oh, shit!

10:27.629 --> 10:29.405
'...nine...'

10:30.805 --> 10:32.525
'...eight...'

10:33.885 --> 10:35.045
'...seven...'

10:37.285 --> 10:39.165
'...six...'

10:41.285 --> 10:42.885
'...five...'

10:44.325 --> 10:45.765
'...four...'

10:47.845 --> 10:49.005
'...three...'

10:51.285 --> 10:52.445
'...two..'

10:54.805 --> 10:56.565
'...one.'

10:56.605 --> 10:58.325
Smash it.

11:18.405 --> 11:20.494
You've got to be kidding me!

11:28.223 --> 11:30.223
What are you doing?

11:31.125 --> 11:33.085
Get out of my fucking way!

12:01.325 --> 12:03.005
Come on!

12:10.725 --> 12:12.565
Come on, Zane.

13:02.045 --> 13:05.085
Come on, Zane.
Stop letting everyone in.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.094
Is this thing telling us
how fast we're going?

13:07.134 --> 13:09.601
No, Mum.
It's telling us we're in last place.

13:11.685 --> 13:13.365
Loser!

13:16.185 --> 13:18.585
Correction.
Now we're in last place.

14:12.285 --> 14:16.045
All units, be advised.
Multiple targets incoming.

14:22.042 --> 14:24.842
OK, people. Racers approaching.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.950
Do you hear that?

14:39.990 --> 14:42.471
That's the sound
of us catching up.

14:42.511 --> 14:44.190
That's not the sound
of us catching up, Mum.

14:44.230 --> 14:46.670
That's the sound of
everyone else getting killed.

14:47.889 --> 14:50.929
- Oh.
- Yeah, "Oh".

14:58.550 --> 14:59.966
Fucking hell, man, you're in!

15:00.006 --> 15:02.505
Still got to face the big boss
at the end of the level.

15:02.545 --> 15:04.505
Keep going, man, you got this.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.990
Shit, quick. Quick.

15:08.030 --> 15:09.630
Come on, guys.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.670
Time to go home.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.559
Yes, sir.

15:13.625 --> 15:15.305
Right, come on,
we ain't got long.

15:16.147 --> 15:18.227
Are you sure we should
be doing this?

15:18.299 --> 15:19.579
Don't worry.

15:25.005 --> 15:27.285
- OK, yes!
- That's what I'm talking about, man!

15:29.085 --> 15:31.045
You fucking did it, man! We're in.

15:35.315 --> 15:37.115
It's just another conspiracy theory

15:37.155 --> 15:39.939
made up by people with too much
time and data at their disposal.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.719
Think about it.
If they had a cure,

15:41.766 --> 15:43.575
do you think
they'd just hand it over?

15:43.654 --> 15:44.641
Er... yeah.

15:44.728 --> 15:46.945
Nah, maybe in a world
run by pixies and fairies.

15:47.007 --> 15:49.007
But, Roman, that's not
the world we live in.

15:49.047 --> 15:51.694
- I never said it was.
- It's all about business.

15:51.795 --> 15:54.004
If they've found a cure,
they'll monetise the fuck out of it.

15:54.094 --> 15:56.452
- That's how Brooke Heath roll.
- And you're gonna change all that?

15:56.513 --> 15:58.603
No, we're gonna change all that.
Me and you.

15:58.663 --> 16:01.383
We're gonna expose them
for the evil fuckers they really are.

16:01.454 --> 16:04.041
I don't know, man.
I should probably be getting back.

16:04.095 --> 16:07.395
Come on. I've got, like, 10,000 files
to go over before we post them.

16:07.435 --> 16:08.815
I can't do that if they're encoded.

16:08.903 --> 16:11.060
- Linus. Got any spare chips?
- No worries.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.632
Thank you. Thank you.
Good day at school, you two?

16:13.672 --> 16:15.448
Yeah. I'm just trying
to persuade Roman

16:15.518 --> 16:18.195
to come help me with this project
we've been set.

16:18.235 --> 16:21.155
Well, it's fine by me.
Curfew's not for another hour yet.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.720
Oh, I don't know.

16:23.822 --> 16:25.862
I've got some other stuff
I need to do.

16:26.035 --> 16:28.038
Why don't we take a look
at it tomorrow?

16:28.110 --> 16:29.470
All right, sweet.

16:29.619 --> 16:30.979
- Peace.
- Hey, safe.

16:31.075 --> 16:34.415
- Take it easy, Mr. Donahue.
- He left me hanging.

16:34.455 --> 16:36.260
Nah.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.755
- I'll see you later.
- See you later, Dad.

16:37.795 --> 16:39.555
Come on, Brutus.

17:02.835 --> 17:04.275
Come on, Roman,

17:04.315 --> 17:06.155
we need to know
which bridge to head for.

17:06.194 --> 17:08.155
Yeah, Roman, come on.

17:18.035 --> 17:20.023
'Calling all ambulance crews.'

17:20.127 --> 17:22.811
'All available Med Vac units
from Guy's Hospital

17:22.880 --> 17:25.940
are requested to attend
the north side of Tower Bridge.'

17:26.002 --> 17:29.235
'Severe casualties expected
at the south side checkpoint.'

17:29.995 --> 17:32.788
- We need to get off this road now.
- What are you doing?

17:32.838 --> 17:35.027
This is Team 21
to all the other contestants.

17:35.115 --> 17:37.155
You need to get off
the A3 straightaway.

17:37.195 --> 17:39.715
There's a massive security presence
at Tower Bridge.

17:39.755 --> 17:43.487
They know about the race, they'll
have secured every bridge in the city,

17:43.527 --> 17:45.995
so you need to find a different way
across the river.

17:55.315 --> 17:57.795
- We need to warn them.
- We don't need to do anything.

17:57.835 --> 18:00.897
The rules are really simple: win.
That's all that matters.

18:00.959 --> 18:03.876
We're not like the other racers, are we?
We're not doing this for ourselves.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.715
Yeah, Michael,
we've got a higher purpose.

18:05.755 --> 18:07.715
We can't just sit back
and let people die.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.275
Who's the best man now,
you piece of shit?

18:18.315 --> 18:20.355
- What did you say to him?
- I didn't say anything.

18:20.417 --> 18:23.475
- How do you patch me through on this?
- You actually know this guy?

18:23.515 --> 18:26.115
What, cos you thought the race
was gonna be too easy?

18:26.155 --> 18:28.515
What happened to letting
bygones be bygones?

18:28.555 --> 18:31.554
- You insulted me.
- When did I insult you?

18:31.594 --> 18:33.675
You said I was
"a piece of shit" driver.

18:33.715 --> 18:35.835
- I didn't say that.
- You implied it.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.875
All I'm doing
is proving you wrong.

18:37.915 --> 18:40.373
But that's crazy.
Look, I'm not even driving.

18:40.413 --> 18:41.802
I don't give a fuck!

18:48.675 --> 18:50.370
- Yes!
- Decent.

19:00.195 --> 19:02.195
Pass me the bag.

19:04.275 --> 19:06.595
I'm not passing you the bag.

19:06.635 --> 19:08.635
You made a promise, Errol.

19:08.675 --> 19:11.075
You said there'd be
no more crazy shit.

19:11.115 --> 19:13.275
And you didn't just make
that promise to me,

19:13.315 --> 19:15.075
you made it to our baby.

19:15.115 --> 19:17.115
- This is different.
- It's not different.

19:17.155 --> 19:20.635
This is exactly the kind of
crazy shit I was talking about.

19:21.783 --> 19:23.983
Now, I can't deal with two babies,
Errol.

19:24.195 --> 19:26.115
We need to win this race.

19:26.155 --> 19:28.755
So I'm gonna need you
to stay true to your promise.

19:29.555 --> 19:31.355
Can you do that or not?

19:32.555 --> 19:33.875
Course I can.

19:35.395 --> 19:37.395
A promise is a promise.

19:49.195 --> 19:51.515
Are you sure this is the right way?

19:51.555 --> 19:54.901
Maybe we should pull over,
just until we've decided.

19:54.941 --> 19:57.863
We don't need to pull over. We just
got to follow the signs for the A214.

19:57.903 --> 20:00.420
No way is that a four.
It looks more like an H.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.982
There is no A21H.

20:02.022 --> 20:04.621
- That's what it says right there.
- That's not an H. It's a four.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.525
- Do you want me to have a look?
- It's definitely left, OK?

20:07.587 --> 20:09.795
All right. Take a left, then, Zane.

20:10.755 --> 20:13.435
Do we actually know how
we're gonna get over the river?

20:13.475 --> 20:17.115
Your dad already had a plan
for everything. It's all in there.

20:17.915 --> 20:19.635
I... I've got it.

20:19.675 --> 20:22.675
Wandsworth Bridge.
According to Dad,

20:22.715 --> 20:25.494
it's the only bridge with a vantage
point accessible from the road.

20:25.534 --> 20:28.155
We should have a good view
of the checkpoint.

20:28.195 --> 20:31.395
- Let's head there, then.
- Still doesn't look like a four.

20:31.435 --> 20:33.915
Does it say what we do
when we get there?

20:33.955 --> 20:35.795
It's hard to say exactly.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.875
But it's definitely got something
to do with projectile ballistics.

21:06.035 --> 21:08.195
This is it. Now we have to go up.

21:11.275 --> 21:13.275
We need a view of the bridge.

21:19.355 --> 21:21.835
The whole plan
is about this pulse beacon.

21:22.437 --> 21:25.525
When this is activated, it will
generate a high-pitched frequency

21:25.565 --> 21:27.029
which the mooks go crazy for.

21:27.069 --> 21:30.524
Just so we're clear: Dad's amazing
plan for getting us over the river

21:30.564 --> 21:34.578
was to set off a device which
actually attracts those things?

21:34.625 --> 21:36.275
Yup.

21:36.315 --> 21:38.655
According to Dad,
we get this on the bridge

21:38.695 --> 21:40.851
and it will start a chain of
events to clear a way through.

21:40.895 --> 21:42.254
Yeah. "According to Dad."

21:42.294 --> 21:45.395
When creature density is high enough,
the army will deal with it for us.

21:45.435 --> 21:46.995
Look!

21:47.795 --> 21:50.155
There it is. Wandsworth Bridge.

21:51.987 --> 21:54.587
Jesus, there's a whole army
down there.

22:04.528 --> 22:07.168
The mooks will come out
from wherever they are.

22:08.023 --> 22:10.208
How do we get this thing
onto the bridge?

22:10.795 --> 22:15.104
Say hello... to my little friend.

22:15.190 --> 22:17.731
- Have you used one of those before?
- Sure, Mum.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.795
He started taking bazooka classes
right after he gave up tap.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.634
Maybe Zane should fire it, darling.

22:23.674 --> 22:25.955
You know, seeing as
we've only got one go.

22:25.995 --> 22:27.875
It's pretty straightforward.

22:31.929 --> 22:34.489
- Are you sure about this?
- You just...

22:38.275 --> 22:39.475
Whoa.

22:39.515 --> 22:40.675
Shit.

22:44.895 --> 22:47.215
Brooke Heath Security.
I'm expected.

22:56.725 --> 22:58.725
Jesus Christ.

23:00.024 --> 23:01.594
What the fuck is that?

23:01.673 --> 23:04.913
She was infected.
Her name's Helen Newman.

23:05.095 --> 23:06.775
Professor Newman?

23:06.815 --> 23:08.775
Whoop-de-fucking-doo.

23:24.935 --> 23:26.775
Is she gonna live?

23:26.815 --> 23:29.135
We'll have a better idea
after we've completed

23:29.175 --> 23:30.771
our preliminary investigations.

23:30.830 --> 23:34.151
But it would've helped
if your man hadn't shot her.

23:35.554 --> 23:38.034
When she wakes up,
I need to talk to her.

23:38.074 --> 23:40.914
I don't think she's spoken
for a number of years.

23:40.954 --> 23:45.009
Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis
it's a curious side effect of the virus.

23:45.244 --> 23:49.003
I'd say the odds of you getting
an interview are 50-50 at best.

23:49.700 --> 23:53.155
So... Garwick breaks out of here,

23:53.216 --> 23:56.324
and the first person he goes to see
is Professor Mooky here

23:57.025 --> 23:59.150
who just so happens to be
the scientist

23:59.198 --> 24:01.438
in charge of the trials
at Kiloran.

24:03.255 --> 24:05.215
The question is...

24:06.695 --> 24:08.975
- ...why?
- Well...

24:10.361 --> 24:13.361
...I think I'll leave that question
to the detectives.

24:21.055 --> 24:23.775
'Team 11 to Team 21. Come in.

24:23.815 --> 24:25.003
Over.'

24:25.089 --> 24:26.569
Turn it off.

24:26.775 --> 24:29.335
'Team 21, please come in. Over.'

24:30.695 --> 24:33.585
- How do we know they'll have one?
- It's in the file.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.625
All ambulances carry them.

24:35.665 --> 24:37.785
Team 21, we need your help.

24:38.015 --> 24:41.495
We pretty much guarantee
we can help you in return.

24:42.455 --> 24:45.040
- I'm answering it.
- You have no idea who it could be.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.815
Not everyone involved in this race
is a homicidal maniac.

24:47.855 --> 24:49.845
Oh, apart from your friend.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.571
You know,
that one that just tried to kill us.

24:52.321 --> 24:55.041
Team 11, this is Team 21.
We read you. Over.

24:55.175 --> 24:58.695
We think we have a proposal
which could be mutually beneficial.

24:58.735 --> 25:00.535
'What do you have in mind?'

25:00.575 --> 25:03.735
'If your ambulance carries a pack of
standard issue pulse beacons,

25:03.775 --> 25:05.495
we can help you.'

25:06.215 --> 25:08.175
Can you be a little more specific?

25:09.775 --> 25:11.735
We'll give you more details
when we meet.

25:11.775 --> 25:14.295
'But we can definitely
help you get across the river.'

25:14.335 --> 25:17.178
'Head to Wandsworth Bridge.
Sending co-ordinates.'

25:17.218 --> 25:19.015
Hey, wait a minute!

25:19.055 --> 25:21.175
How can we trust them?
It could be a trap.

25:21.215 --> 25:23.535
Look, we have no other way
across the river.

25:23.575 --> 25:25.455
So let's just hear these guys out.

25:26.935 --> 25:28.535
We're on our way.

25:29.730 --> 25:31.730
Nice one, bro.

25:42.935 --> 25:45.335
Roman?

25:45.375 --> 25:48.055
Have you seen Linus?
He wasn't at registration.

25:48.095 --> 25:50.055
Haven't seen him, sir.

27:12.156 --> 27:14.196
Everything all right?

27:14.455 --> 27:16.332
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.588
Just looking through some
old files for my coursework.

27:19.025 --> 27:20.705
Hey, you seen Linus at all?

27:20.855 --> 27:22.154
No.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.820
I mean,
he wasn't at school today.

27:23.890 --> 27:26.935
His bike is outside and there are
removal men at his house.

27:26.975 --> 27:28.435
Looks like they're moving out.

27:28.514 --> 27:29.995
He didn't mention anything?

27:30.077 --> 27:31.277
No.

27:31.340 --> 27:34.799
But, like I said,
he wasn't at school today, so...

27:36.535 --> 27:37.994
OK.

27:38.071 --> 27:39.911
- Sure you're all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

27:39.975 --> 27:41.935
- Honestly, Dad.
- OK.

28:43.575 --> 28:45.575
What have you got there?

28:49.135 --> 28:50.655
It's not mine.

28:51.415 --> 28:53.375
And in the other pocket?

29:07.055 --> 29:08.681
'I think we've arrived.'

29:08.753 --> 29:10.977
- 'What floor are you on?'
- We're up on the roof.

29:11.037 --> 29:12.597
Head straight to the top.

29:12.715 --> 29:15.793
What if it's just some trap
to fuck us over or slow us down?

29:15.849 --> 29:19.339
I don't think so. She warned everyone
about the roadblock on the bridge.

29:19.379 --> 29:21.761
Anyway, according to Dad,
it's OK to team up...

29:21.801 --> 29:24.655
Stop saying that! Dad's dead.

29:24.695 --> 29:26.176
He barely made it
out of the house

29:26.216 --> 29:28.375
before he got eaten
by a fucking monster.

29:28.415 --> 29:30.193
He didn't have a section
in his file for that!

29:30.263 --> 29:31.415
Megan!

29:35.215 --> 29:37.015
What happened to your father...

29:38.555 --> 29:40.955
...none of us have come to terms
with it yet.

29:42.229 --> 29:45.285
He was the most loyal...

29:45.891 --> 29:48.935
...brilliant and irritating man
I ever met.

29:48.975 --> 29:50.415
But he had a plan.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.455
He always had a plan.

29:52.495 --> 29:54.615
And he believed in it.

29:54.655 --> 29:56.375
And I believe in him.

29:56.415 --> 29:59.255
The last thing we need to do
is to start doubting him.

30:00.375 --> 30:02.375
Your brother's right.

30:02.415 --> 30:05.535
We just have to have a little bit
of faith in these people.

30:05.575 --> 30:09.615
Then we fire that bomb onto the bridge
and then all we have to do is wait.

30:12.370 --> 30:14.850
- Isn't that right, Roman?
- Yeah.

30:16.295 --> 30:18.043
According to Dad.

30:23.415 --> 30:26.257
Don't tell me
you still think it's a trap?

30:26.312 --> 30:28.815
Look at them.
They're terrified.

30:28.855 --> 30:30.935
That doesn't mean anything
any more.

30:36.353 --> 30:37.953
Hi.

30:39.335 --> 30:40.855
Hi.

30:46.895 --> 30:48.575
This what you're after?

31:00.535 --> 31:02.415
Oh, fuck.

31:04.846 --> 31:06.526
Hey.

31:20.815 --> 31:22.535
I think we're in business.

31:31.695 --> 31:34.455
- What now?
- Well, now we wait.

31:37.375 --> 31:39.200
- Did you bring any crisps?
- I did.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.815
But I want you to eat
a sandwich first.

31:41.855 --> 31:44.215
I've got egg mayonnaise
or cheese and pickle.

31:44.255 --> 31:46.090
Cheese and pickle,
please, Mum.

31:46.162 --> 31:47.602
Yeah, yeah.

31:49.775 --> 31:51.775
Here. There you go.

31:52.815 --> 31:55.455
Oh, this is so good.
I'm starving.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.455
I wanted to say thank you.

31:58.495 --> 32:00.775
Not everyone would've responded
to our call.

32:01.031 --> 32:02.431
Yeah...

32:02.744 --> 32:05.464
Well, er... not everyone in
this race is a homicidal maniac.

32:07.015 --> 32:09.255
- It's all right?
- Yeah.

32:10.072 --> 32:11.952
- Thanks.
- Mm.

32:14.458 --> 32:17.218
So, talk me through this again.

32:18.721 --> 32:21.261
Basically, when the creature
density on the bridge

32:21.301 --> 32:23.055
gets over 200 per hectare,

32:23.095 --> 32:25.723
the Central Security
defence protocol kicks in

32:25.763 --> 32:28.452
and they send in the drone bombers
which blow everything up.

32:28.492 --> 32:30.212
Oh.

32:31.295 --> 32:33.775
- You'd better be right.
- Have faith, mister.

32:33.815 --> 32:36.735
My brother knows what he's doing.
Isn't that right?

32:40.689 --> 32:42.528
I think it's starting to work.

32:42.609 --> 32:45.707
Yeah. Whatever that frequency is,
the creatures can't get enough of it.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.600
Where are they all coming from?

32:49.640 --> 32:51.400
All over.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.400
It's like giving them crack.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.440
Apparently.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.240
Guys?

33:18.080 --> 33:20.500
Er... guys?

33:25.880 --> 33:27.920
You know, we can see your penis.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.267
Keep moving.

33:42.307 --> 33:44.747
Hey, don't worry.
It's all part of the plan.

33:59.440 --> 34:03.320
They won't attack us so long as the
pulse beacon's giving off that signal.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.120
We just need to wait for the...

34:06.160 --> 34:08.320
...boom.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.520
Your father would have been proud.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.639
'And the files
you downloaded?'

34:34.679 --> 34:36.360
'That was Linus.'

34:36.400 --> 34:38.800
I just wanted to leave a message,
you know?

34:38.840 --> 34:40.956
Let them know how lame
the security systems were,

34:40.996 --> 34:43.715
but Linus said the files
were important.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.679
- But you've no idea what's on them?
- No.

34:47.722 --> 34:49.681
I told him it could leave a trail.

34:50.476 --> 34:52.476
That's why we used
his IP address instead.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.400
Maybe I should just hand myself in.

35:00.120 --> 35:03.688
I mean, technically, I'm still a kid
so there could be a case for leniency.

35:03.774 --> 35:06.400
There's no such thing as leniency.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.840
Not any more.

35:08.354 --> 35:10.794
They'll lock you up
and throw away the key.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.348
They don't...

35:12.723 --> 35:16.698
...they don't care that you're young
and you just made a mistake.

35:16.738 --> 35:18.800
They don't care about
anything any more.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.920
- So what do I do?
- So what do we do?

35:25.760 --> 35:27.760
What do we do?

35:30.200 --> 35:31.400
Come on.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.480
Where's your...

35:37.560 --> 35:39.120
Here.

35:39.160 --> 35:40.695
Fire it up.

35:40.754 --> 35:42.474
Let's see what's so important.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.160
What?

35:55.000 --> 35:56.335
I'm not saying I approve

35:56.375 --> 36:00.000
but watching you on that computer,
it's like watching a concert pianist.

36:00.040 --> 36:03.320
- I'm just crunching data.
- Crunching data! No, you're not.

36:03.883 --> 36:05.763
You are brilliant.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.760
Don't you ever forget that.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.640
That's weird.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.360
They're coming for me.
I know they're coming for me.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.800
They've shut down all my accounts.
I can't get online.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.160
I can't do anything.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.746
Roman, if you're watching this,
then you've got the files.

36:32.817 --> 36:35.120
It's dark, man.
It's Brooke Heath, it's fucked up!

36:35.160 --> 36:36.880
The whole virus it was them.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.242
They were there
from the beginning

36:38.287 --> 36:40.783
and they'll do anything
to make sure no-one knows...

36:45.402 --> 36:48.930
We have to get you somewhere safe,
somewhere far away from here.

36:49.031 --> 36:50.600
And how are we gonna do that, Dad?

36:50.640 --> 36:52.840
The first thing we have to do,
Roman,

36:52.880 --> 36:55.243
is you have to delete all these
files.

36:55.298 --> 36:57.440
And then you have to destroy
this computer and...

36:57.480 --> 36:59.480
It won't make a difference, Dad.
They'll track me down.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.460
Then we'll just have to move faster
than they do, all right?

37:01.500 --> 37:04.440
We'll figure it out, Roman.
We'll figure it out, I promise you.

37:04.480 --> 37:08.200
But first get rid of that data
and do not talk to anyone.

37:31.637 --> 37:33.237
Got to hand it to you, kid.

37:33.738 --> 37:37.258
We've got about a three-minute window
until they dispatch reinforcements.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.740
Will it hold?

37:38.801 --> 37:40.521
It'll hold.

37:40.561 --> 37:42.561
Might want to take a run up,
though.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.600
Quite a barbecue
you've been having.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.600
You planning on driving
across that?

37:59.440 --> 38:03.440
It's a three-span cantilever bridge,
so the structure's pretty sound.

38:04.120 --> 38:06.160
I remember you.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.280
You're the smart kid,
aren't you?

38:08.320 --> 38:10.520
We should get going.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.409
Structurally sound, you say?

38:12.449 --> 38:14.609
Well, it carries 50,000 vehicles
a day, so...

38:14.649 --> 38:19.664
Not today it doesn't.
Today it's carrying 49,998.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.360
How do you work that out?

38:27.960 --> 38:30.721
Simply the best, motherfucker.

38:35.240 --> 38:36.880
See ya.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.280
- Are you all right, Roman?
- I'm fine, Mum.

38:44.760 --> 38:47.360
Why did a total stranger
just shoot our tyres out?

38:47.400 --> 38:49.880
I just don't think
he's a very nice person.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.200
Right.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.052
Do you guys know...

39:00.092 --> 39:03.453
Where's that thing
that lifts the car up?

39:03.493 --> 39:04.981
What are they called?

39:07.447 --> 39:08.927
This is useless.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.585
Is there any chance
you can lend us a hand?

39:12.625 --> 39:16.185
Let's get something straight.
That back there was a one off.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.800
OK, sure.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.654
It's got to be
higher up somewhere...

39:25.694 --> 39:27.945
We've got a plan
for getting out of the city.

39:27.985 --> 39:29.600
The cops are gonna be here
in a minute.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.958
Look, we know a way through the wall
no-one knows about except for us.

39:33.053 --> 39:35.548
Sorry, kid.
You're on your own from now on.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Right. Got it.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.446
How you doing, guys?
Is it working?

39:47.930 --> 39:49.272
We can't just leave them here.

39:49.312 --> 39:51.272
They're toast. Let's get going.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.672
No, we said we'd help them
across the bridge.

39:56.564 --> 39:58.858
Oh, God, thank you.
Thank you so much.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.600
- Honestly, thank you.
- We've got no idea.

40:39.011 --> 40:40.091
Whoa!

40:47.800 --> 40:49.600
What do you think of the plan?

40:50.640 --> 40:53.138
- What plan?
- The one I gave to your girlfriend.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.863
No, she's not my girlfriend.

41:06.440 --> 41:08.640
He's got a plan
to get us out of the city.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.480
But you're not gonna like it.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.046
Yeah, cos this isn't
a team game.

41:12.086 --> 41:13.366
Right.

41:20.739 --> 41:23.499
That is one
seriously fucked-up plan.
