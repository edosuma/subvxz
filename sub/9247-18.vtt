WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:05.962
Alright, that's it.
This is the last payment.

00:06.049 --> 00:08.878
So, this credit card
is now officially paid off.

00:08.965 --> 00:12.229
Wow, I've never paid off
a credit card without..

00:12.316 --> 00:15.102
...using another credit card
to do it.

00:15.189 --> 00:18.409
So you've never actually
paid off a credit card.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.194
This was a celebration.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.934
Hey, now that we're flush

00:22.022 --> 00:25.460
how about we take
a romantic spring break getaway?

00:25.547 --> 00:27.723
Honey, we didn't win the lotto,
we just paid off money

00:27.810 --> 00:29.681
we didn't have
in the first place.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.075
Potato, "po-tah-to."

00:32.162 --> 00:34.121
By the way, uh,
can I see that credit card?

00:34.208 --> 00:36.253
"Abs-uh-tutely."

00:36.340 --> 00:39.909
I'm keeping it in the back since
you said it was off-limits.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.042
But now I'm moving this little
baby to the front line.

00:42.129 --> 00:45.219
Get ready for battle.

00:45.306 --> 00:48.787
Or, we could retire it
completely from the rotation.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.833
Retire it,
oh, like, only use it

00:50.920 --> 00:53.444
when my other cards
are declined.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.838
No, retire it,
like, cutting it in half

00:55.925 --> 00:57.492
to send a message
to the other cards

00:57.579 --> 01:00.886
like the horse's head
in "The Godfather."

01:00.973 --> 01:02.975
I think that's a..
That's against the law.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.716
I mean, that's like defacing
a dollar bill

01:04.803 --> 01:07.545
or burning the flag.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.591
Look, I'm not trying to be
the fun police

01:09.678 --> 01:11.419
I would just prefer
not to raise our baby

01:11.506 --> 01:14.639
in a shopping cart
under a bridge.

01:14.726 --> 01:19.644
As long as the family's
together.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.037
So, you're going to cut up
that card?

01:21.124 --> 01:22.778
- Nope.
- Oh, thank you.

01:22.865 --> 01:25.694
You're going to cut up
that card.

01:25.781 --> 01:31.265
That's just mean. That's like,
that's like drug lord behavior.

01:31.352 --> 01:33.136
Honey, this card is dangerous.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.095
Especially in the wrong hands.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.184
Okay, you don't have
to get nasty.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.620
Pretend like
you're cutting the ribbon

01:38.707 --> 01:40.230
to the grand opening
of our future.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.580
Just give me the scissors.

01:44.974 --> 01:47.150
Alright.

01:47.237 --> 01:50.110
Ah...done.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.676
I'm proud of you.

01:51.763 --> 01:54.331
Removing temptation
is the first step.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.376
- Is it?
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.291
Is that what we're doing now?

01:57.378 --> 02:00.076
Well, let's keep that going,
huh?

02:00.163 --> 02:01.947
Let's get rid of that Milky Way
that you've got

02:02.034 --> 02:04.515
hidden in the back of the
freezer.

02:04.602 --> 02:05.647
You know about that?

02:05.734 --> 02:06.735
Oh, yeah, good try,

02:06.822 --> 02:08.084
wrapping it in white paper

02:08.171 --> 02:10.869
and writing "liver"
on the outside.

02:10.956 --> 02:13.263
Nah, I just keep that there
in case of an emergency.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.352
[mocking]
Removing temptation
is the first step.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.702
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.226
What are you going to do
with it?

02:19.313 --> 02:20.227
I'm not going to do
anything with it.

02:20.314 --> 02:21.837
You...are gonna put it

02:21.924 --> 02:23.708
down the garbage disposal.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.452
You're loving this, aren't you?

02:28.539 --> 02:31.325
It's taking a little
bit of the edge off.

02:31.412 --> 02:36.808
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

02:36.895 --> 02:40.160

02:51.997 --> 02:53.347
You should've seen Molly's face

02:53.434 --> 02:54.652
when I made her cut up
that credit card.

02:54.739 --> 02:55.871
Like she could hear the screams

02:55.958 --> 02:58.656
of all the unbought shoes.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.005
One of the biggest causes
of friction

03:00.092 --> 03:01.616
between couples is money.

03:01.703 --> 03:04.358
That, and using
the other one's toiletries.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.055
She does hate it
when I use her hairbrush

03:06.142 --> 03:08.362
to scratch my back.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.799
Yeah, my pet peeve is when
a woman uses my toothbrush.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.279
I don't care how hot she is.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.194
If she leaves a sesame seed
between them bristles

03:14.281 --> 03:16.326
it's bye-bye, baby,
and you owe me an Oral B medium

03:16.413 --> 03:19.808
for sensitive teeth and gums.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.592
I hate being in charge
of the purse strings

03:21.679 --> 03:24.160
but somebody's got to be
fiscally responsible, right?

03:24.247 --> 03:25.379
Eh, I feel for you, man.

03:25.466 --> 03:26.771
Nobody likes
having to remind somebody

03:26.858 --> 03:29.165
to turn off the lights
or not use every drop

03:29.252 --> 03:30.993
of hot water in our apartment.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.821
I am not the one who takes
three-hour bubble baths

03:32.908 --> 03:34.779
with a duck and a GI Joe.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.390
Hey, the duck is a sponge,
and the GI Joe

03:36.477 --> 03:38.000
is what the bubble bath came in.

03:38.087 --> 03:42.526
I use my stocking stuffers.
Now get me some more coffee.

03:42.613 --> 03:46.226
Absolutely. Right after I floss
my buttocks with your bacon.

03:46.313 --> 03:49.359
I'm still going to eat it.

03:49.446 --> 03:53.798
Hey, you know, if you're
worried about finances..

03:53.885 --> 03:55.365
...maybe we can put
in for some overtime.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.976
You know, one of those
selective duty gigs.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.282
I think they only dole those out

03:59.369 --> 04:00.805
to officers with higher
seniority

04:00.892 --> 04:04.331
or more commendations,
or anybody but us.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.377
Ordinarily. However, your
mother's dating the captain.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.336
That's our ace in the hole.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.598
The captain's
our ace and your mother's--

04:10.685 --> 04:12.513
I get it.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.689
I'm just saying,
you want to get ahead in life

04:14.776 --> 04:15.994
you got to eat the fruit
of opportunity

04:16.081 --> 04:17.387
when it falls off the tree.

04:17.474 --> 04:18.606
Did you get
from your self-help tapes

04:18.693 --> 04:19.694
or the Green Grocer?

04:19.781 --> 04:21.391
Ah, my self-help tapes
got ruined

04:21.478 --> 04:24.176
when somebody spilled
a Red Bull on my Walkman.

04:27.397 --> 04:30.095
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

04:33.925 --> 04:37.364
Maybe I don't care.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.539
Got to be clean back there.

He was in the shower
for 45 minutes.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.812
Hey, Teach.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.771
No big travel plans
this spring break, huh?

04:55.599 --> 04:58.167
Nope, just going to stay here
in Chicago

04:58.254 --> 05:00.648
see where the Windy City
blows me.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.911
That's the spin you're
giving it, huh?

05:02.998 --> 05:05.043
Well, the jig-sawed credit card
in the trash can

05:05.130 --> 05:08.656
tells another tale.

05:08.743 --> 05:11.311
Just eat your cheese,
you little rat.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.748
You know, just 'cause
you're financially hobbled

05:13.835 --> 05:15.315
doesn't mean you can't have fun.

05:15.402 --> 05:18.318
I know that. Yeah, I'm going
to check out some museums.

05:18.405 --> 05:21.364
You know, see a couple
free concerts.

05:21.451 --> 05:22.496
You know what I do
when I'm bored?

05:22.583 --> 05:26.108
You eat cheese and talk to me?

05:26.195 --> 05:28.110
I stroll down to the firehouse

05:28.197 --> 05:29.764
and watch them wash the trucks.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.070
Well, don't let me keep you.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.855
They would do it
on the weekends.

05:33.942 --> 05:39.208
You know, once, Fireman Gus
let me slide down the pole.

05:39.295 --> 05:43.038
Did he let you wear the hat
and hold his hose?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.996
Nah, they're pretty touchy
about their uniform.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.738
But if you bring donuts,
they let you pet the dog.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.917
Ooh! Here's another
fun excursion.

05:53.004 --> 05:56.138
Go to the Fudge Pot
and watch them pull taffy.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.880
Warning,
You can lose a whole day

05:58.967 --> 06:01.796
watching that silky concoction
go round and round.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.629

a bite of my cheese?

06:13.155 --> 06:16.201
Yeah, he's fine, Margaret.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.378
Yes, I've been giving him
his antibiotics

06:18.465 --> 06:20.249
and taking him out every
15 minutes.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.164

what it smells like,
it's urine.

No, I'm not going to get down
on my hand and knees..

06:29.345 --> 06:31.695
Fine.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.610
I'll do that the next time
I take him out.

06:33.697 --> 06:37.309
Love you.. Hello?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.268
Got you dog-sitting now, huh?

06:39.355 --> 06:41.705
Well, your mother
went riverboat gambling

06:41.792 --> 06:42.967
with the other lunch ladies

06:43.054 --> 06:44.882
and she didn't want
to leave Jim alone.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.058
Funny, she once left me
in a car for three hours

06:47.145 --> 06:50.410
while she played Pachinko
at the Elks Lodge.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.674
She's got her favorites.
Just get over it. I did.

06:53.761 --> 06:56.328
- So what's on your mind, Biggs?
- Oh, nothing much.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.330
I'm just trying
to make some extra money

06:58.418 --> 07:00.681
and I thought I could maybe
put in for some overtime.

07:00.768 --> 07:03.074
You do realize the eight hours
we give you now

07:03.161 --> 07:06.513
is basically just a gift
from the city.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.863
Yes, sir, you pointed that out
several times at roll call.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.212
Well, I got to make it
fun for me

07:10.299 --> 07:13.650
otherwise it's just
reading a list of names.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.391
I was just thinking I could
maybe get one of those

07:15.478 --> 07:18.220
selective duty details
that I've heard about.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.961
Those assignments
are generally given

07:20.048 --> 07:22.572
to our senior officers,
and as a reward

07:22.659 --> 07:24.226
for excellence in the field.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.228
Well, I might not have seniority
or excellence

07:26.315 --> 07:29.361
but I do have
near-perfect attendance.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.363
I'm not giving
one of those plum jobs

07:31.451 --> 07:33.583
to the untucked beat cop
who locked himself

07:33.670 --> 07:35.280
out of his own squad car.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.021
You heard about that, huh?

07:37.108 --> 07:39.241
Well, the perp in the back
claimed he got frostbite

07:39.328 --> 07:40.416
and threatened to sue the city.

07:40.503 --> 07:41.591
That was ridiculous.

07:41.678 --> 07:42.636
The car was running.

07:42.723 --> 07:43.941
I went to get him coffee.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.335
People, huh?

07:46.422 --> 07:48.163
Point being, I can't just drop

07:48.250 --> 07:52.297
one of those plum assignments
into your rather ample lap.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.342
Okay.

07:53.429 --> 07:55.692
I just thought I'd ask.

07:57.346 --> 08:01.219
Gosh, my mom's
sure going to be disappointed.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.310
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, nothing.

08:05.397 --> 08:09.184
She's just really looking
forward to being a grandmother.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.925
What does that have to do
with anything?

08:11.012 --> 08:13.797
Well, I'm just trying to earn
a few extra bucks

08:13.884 --> 08:15.799
so that the wife and I can
afford

08:15.886 --> 08:20.195
to start a family,
but...not meant to be.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.371
So, if I don't pony up
some overtime

08:22.458 --> 08:24.678
you're going to run
crying to mama?

08:24.765 --> 08:26.506
No.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.246
When she asks why we're not
trying to get pregnant

08:28.333 --> 08:29.552
anymore,
I can't lie to her.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.685
That's my mother, sir.

08:36.385 --> 08:41.564
I suppose I could shuffle
some names around..

08:41.651 --> 08:44.045
...throw a few overtime hours
your way.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.438
Golly, that'd be swell, Captain.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.876
Nothing too dangerous, though.
I don't want my mom to worry.

08:48.963 --> 08:50.704
You're a police officer.

08:50.791 --> 08:53.445
Sure, sure, I was just thinking
something indoors

08:53.533 --> 08:55.926
and sitting in a comfortable
chair, watching a bank of--

08:56.013 --> 08:57.928
- Get out of my office, Biggs.
- Okay! Yes, sir.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.931
My dear mother is going to be
very pleased.

09:01.018 --> 09:04.152
Thank you.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.067
And I thought
the low point of my day

09:06.154 --> 09:09.070
was tagging and bagging
your runny stool.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.383
God, I wonder what time
that taffy pull starts.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.778
Hey, Mol,
is the big cooler down here?

09:21.865 --> 09:23.650
It's next to the water heater.
What do you need it for?

09:23.737 --> 09:25.782
Are you kidding me?
It's spring break.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.263
All us college kids are going
down to Daytona Beach.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.570
- Whoo-hoo!
- It's spring break?

09:30.657 --> 09:32.441
Victoria,
you've been in three classes

09:32.528 --> 09:34.791
at a junior college
for half a semester.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.358
And now it's time
for this bookworm

09:36.445 --> 09:39.100
to blow off some steam.
Whoo-hoo!

09:39.187 --> 09:41.668
Sweetie, don't you think you're
a little old for beer bongs

09:41.755 --> 09:43.104
and wet t-shirt contests?

09:43.191 --> 09:45.062
Oh, I don't think there's
an age limit.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.629
The only requirements
are good boobs

09:46.716 --> 09:48.805
and a dry t-shirt.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.112
You've got about ten years
on most of those kids.

09:51.199 --> 09:52.809
Don't you think it's going
to look a little pathetic

09:52.896 --> 09:54.376
you crashing parties
by yourself?

09:54.463 --> 09:57.379
- Well, then come with me.
- Okay.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.294
No. No, I mean no.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.078
Mike and I
are trying to save money.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.297
I've got all the gas

10:02.384 --> 10:04.821
and the motel room
is already paid for.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.041
God, so I wouldn't have
to spend money on anything.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.825
Just food and booze and you'd be
doing that here anyway.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.261
That's true.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.089
Plus, hanging out
with Vince all day

10:12.176 --> 10:14.265
I'd probably drink more.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.703
If we leave now, we can be
drinking Buttery Nipples

10:16.790 --> 10:19.575
on the beach in 19 short hours.

10:21.490 --> 10:24.667
- I can't.
- Can't?

10:24.754 --> 10:26.887
Or cannot?

10:32.675 --> 10:36.113
Wait a second,
so, we start tonight?

10:36.200 --> 10:38.550
He must be more scared
of your mom than you are.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.292
Terrified, I was thinking about
asking for satellite radio

10:41.379 --> 10:44.034
for the squad car,
but one favor at a time.

[cell phone ringing]

10:49.257 --> 10:51.520
Hey, sweetie, what's up?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.522
Actually, I-I won't be coming
home tonight.

10:53.609 --> 10:56.307
The captain has requested us
for some special duty.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.353
We might be guarding Oprah or
walking strippers to their car

10:58.440 --> 10:59.441
when they get off work.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.225
Shh!

11:01.312 --> 11:03.271
Daytona Beach?

11:03.358 --> 11:06.230
And your sister's
paying for everything?

11:06.317 --> 11:08.015
Well, if you want to go, go.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.712
Maybe we'll get an assignment
where we get to use

11:09.799 --> 11:11.801
those infrared
night-vision goggles.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.108
No, I-I won't be
around much anyway.

11:14.195 --> 11:17.720
You have a good time.
I love you.

11:17.807 --> 11:20.114
- He said I could go.
- Thank God!

11:20.201 --> 11:22.072
'Cause we're almost
at the Kentucky border.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.074

This is your
idea of a plum detail?

11:41.004 --> 11:42.963
Guarding a room full of stiffs?

11:43.050 --> 11:44.399
I wondered why the captain
was chuckling

11:44.486 --> 11:47.228
when he gave me the address.

11:47.315 --> 11:50.318
You know how I am around dead
bodies. They give me the creeps.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.668
That's why I don't let you do
the chalk outline anymore.

11:52.755 --> 11:55.715
One big circle doesn't
help the CSI guys.

12:00.328 --> 12:03.070
You know, I had a paranormal
experience one time.

12:03.157 --> 12:05.550
Quit it.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.989
My Uncle Jesse appeared
to me at the front of my bed

12:09.076 --> 12:11.861
in a green, smoky mist.

12:11.948 --> 12:12.949
Really?

12:13.036 --> 12:13.994
Yeah, it was like he was trying

12:14.081 --> 12:16.387
to tell me something.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.999
But I couldn't make it out.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.349
You know?
It just sounded like ah!

12:26.136 --> 12:28.878
but it was like I was paralyzed.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.315
And the room got hot.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.753
Then, all of a sudden,
it got cold.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.581
It got...deathly cold.

you a cup of coffee.

were little

- My mom and I never saw him.
- Mm.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.839
Well, I'm guessing
that was more about your mom

16:54.926 --> 16:56.972
than it was about you.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.887
It certainly explains
why an Irish Catholic

Softball League.

when he should have been.
