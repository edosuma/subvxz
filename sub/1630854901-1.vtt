01:43.603 --> 01:45.814

02:15.177 --> 02:18.055
You know
the first thing I thought

02:18.055 --> 02:19.848
when I saw you?

02:20.974 --> 02:24.853
I thought, "I want to make
a child with that person."

02:26.938 --> 02:29.232
What if it's a her?

02:29.232 --> 02:31.360
What would you call her?

02:32.361 --> 02:34.488
Ragni, maybe.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.073
Sorry?

02:36.073 --> 02:37.699
Ragni.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.994
Uh, let me think about
that for a second.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.330
- Ragni.
- You hate it.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.040
- Uh, boy's name?
- Texas.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.293
You kidding me?

02:48.293 --> 02:50.796
Texas is, like, a state,
you know? -I know.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.840
There's about
three or four hours

02:53.840 --> 02:55.175
till we reach the peak.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.052
Ah, great.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.019
Sweetie, can I just say
one last thing?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.563
Then, I swear,
no more wedding talk.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.024
- Of course.
- It's about the band.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.610
But that is the one thing
you said I could handle myself,

03:13.610 --> 03:16.196
and I've already made
my decision, Elsa.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.240
Yeah, it's just that
I don't want

03:18.240 --> 03:20.200
to use your brother's band.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.785
- Why not?
- Honey...

03:21.785 --> 03:23.245
He's super, super good.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.205
- He works super hard.
- Yeah.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.957
And-and he-he even takes
vocal lessons now.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.542
Yeah, I know this.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.336
I know this. It's just that,
um, well, Eric is no good.

03:31.336 --> 03:35.006
I mean, he's, well,
terrible, actually.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.467
His singing is like shit.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.682
Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...

03:43.682 --> 03:45.392
Olaf!

03:46.184 --> 03:48.186
Olaf, I didn't mean to...
Oh, God.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.771
Wait for me.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.731
Why are you so sensitive?

03:57.279 --> 03:59.239
Told you I could get us here.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.039
It's beautiful.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.999
Thank you. I love you.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.680
Elsa.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.725
- Look. Look.
- What is it? Hmm? Hmm?

04:27.642 --> 04:29.102
- Look.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.857
Quick, the camera.
Get the camera.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.860
Oh, my, I've always wanted
to see a bear in real life.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.529
First, humpbacks in Iceland,
and now this.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.032
We have such good luck
in nature.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.126
What do you see?

04:54.544 --> 04:55.962
Hmm?

04:55.962 --> 04:58.632
It's demented or something.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.966
What?

05:03.428 --> 05:05.180
Can I get the camera?
Give me the camera. -Yeah.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.224
Demented?

05:07.224 --> 05:08.767
I-I-I think we should leave it.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.810
It's-it's something wrong
with it. Come on.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.187
- Come on...
Ah!

05:12.187 --> 05:14.648
Shh. Come on.
It's so cute.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.151
Oh, there's nothing
to be afraid of, Kristoffer.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.570
I'm not afraid, Elsa.

05:21.404 --> 05:24.032
Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.328
Oh, fuck.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.831
Don't panic.

05:31.831 --> 05:32.999
What do we do?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.543
"If it's black, fight back.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.545
If it's brown, lay down."

05:36.545 --> 05:38.213
But is it black or is it brown?

05:38.213 --> 05:39.548
I mean, it looks brown to me.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.341
We're in Appalachia.
It's black.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.051
- We have to fight it.
- How do you know?

05:43.051 --> 05:45.095
You're not a bear expert.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.722
Whatever you do, don't...

05:47.722 --> 05:49.808
- Run! Where are we going?
- Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.518
- I said don't run! Stop! Stop!
- Uphill. Uphill.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.188
Run!
- Where do we go?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.566
- Run, Elsa! Run!
- Where do we go?

05:57.566 --> 05:59.693
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

05:59.693 --> 06:01.903
- Run!

06:01.903 --> 06:03.697
He's coming! Come on!

06:03.697 --> 06:05.407
No! It's following...

06:12.038 --> 06:13.832
Olaf! No!

06:13.832 --> 06:15.083
God!

06:25.343 --> 06:26.761
Help me!
- Come on! Come on!

06:26.761 --> 06:28.722
Olaf!

06:52.621 --> 06:54.289
This is drugs.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.667
This is your brain on drugs.

06:57.667 --> 07:02.339
It isn't glamorous
or cool or kid stuff.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.591
The thrill can kill.

07:04.591 --> 07:09.596
Smoking crack is like
putting a gun in your mouth...

07:11.556 --> 07:13.808
...and pulling the trigger.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.856
Millions of dollars' worth of
cocaine dropped from the sky

07:19.856 --> 07:22.942
early today onto a driveway
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.944
Kenley Jones reports tonight
it was found

07:24.944 --> 07:27.447
on the body of a man
who fell to his death

07:27.447 --> 07:29.449
when his parachute
failed to open.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.037
The body of the heavily
armed parachutist was found

07:34.037 --> 07:36.790
early this morning
by 85-year-old Fred Myers

07:36.790 --> 07:38.792
and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.794
And you could see that
his main chute didn't open,

07:40.794 --> 07:42.879
so I guess the loafers
was too much for him.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.715
Police found more than
70 pounds of cocaine

07:45.715 --> 07:47.801
wrapped in
football-size packages

07:47.801 --> 07:50.845
in a duffel bag
the chutist was carrying.

07:56.101 --> 08:00.271
Emergency chute deployed,
but didn't help much, I suppose.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.316
Any narcotics found
with the plane wreckage?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.984
Nothing.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.112
Here's the I.D.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.863
I know who that is.

08:08.863 --> 08:12.409
Full name:
Andrew C. Thornton II.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.661
Man was out of his mind.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.582
- What's the "C" stand for?
- Hmm?

08:19.582 --> 08:22.836
You said "full name," but
you didn't say his full name.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.842
Thornton was one of Syd
White's guys out of Missouri.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.886
He's a known drug trafficker
with ties to Colombia.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.848
Part of
the Bluegrass Conspiracy.

08:34.848 --> 08:39.018
And there's more of this
out there.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.062
They dumped it somewhere.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.191
Hey, Reba,
you have a dog, right?

08:45.191 --> 08:47.026
Had.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.738
Border collie. Barry.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.157
Sorry for your loss.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.159
Border collie, huh?

08:54.159 --> 08:56.244
That's a cool dog.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.579
Did he play fetch and stuff?

08:57.579 --> 08:58.955
He loved fetch.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.208
What?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.169
Nothing. I just...

09:04.169 --> 09:07.088
That's just awesome.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.567
Damn it, Gabe.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.319
Hi, Daveed.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.073
Uh, mind if I order first?

09:34.073 --> 09:36.075
This won't take long.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.334
Damn, I just bought these.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.509
Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.886
Did you hear about Thornton?

09:55.637 --> 09:56.763
It's a tough way to go.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.973
He only had 30 kilos on him.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.934
Any idea where
we could find the rest?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.436
Chattahoochee.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.729
Georgia?

10:04.729 --> 10:06.564
There's an area
called Blood Mountain.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.441
When the plane's going down,

10:08.441 --> 10:10.443
the pilots know
where to drop our load.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.028
And then we just go and get it.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.448
I don't need a bunch
of worried Colombians.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.283
Now, I want you
to take Eddie with you.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.660
Eddie's in mourning.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.495
Joanie just died.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.788
And he quit.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.706
Joanie's the reason why he quit.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.458
She's not here anymore.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.627
The sooner he moves on,
the better.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.838
Syd, I-I just don't...

10:29.838 --> 10:31.047
Stop.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.925
He won't even come
to get his goddamn son.

10:33.925 --> 10:37.303
I am sick and tired
of watching my kid's kid.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.722
Grandpa Syd, watch.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.017
Yeah, that's great.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.772
Got to go. Shift starts at 8:00.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.442
Tomorrow's lunch is in
the fridge, and the chicken's...

10:53.444 --> 10:55.029
Chicken's in the microwave.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.906
Just hit "start."

10:57.740 --> 10:59.826
Thought you were off tonight.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.578
We talked about this, remember?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.121
Me picking up some extra shifts?

11:03.121 --> 11:04.664
You said you were okay with it.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.374
I was okay with it
until I realized

11:06.374 --> 11:08.334
why you want
those extra shifts--

11:08.334 --> 11:12.672
so you could go and do overtime
with Ray the Pediatrician.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.676
Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.513
You know, he invited us
to go to Nashville

11:20.513 --> 11:22.098
this weekend
to see his band play.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.934
We were supposed to go paint
the waterfall this weekend.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.811
I know, but it's gonna be fun.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.354
We're gonna make
a whole weekend out of it.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.273
It's Nashville.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.984
He's a good guy, Deirdra.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.403
Just...

11:35.403 --> 11:36.779
Give him a chance.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.948
Please don't do that.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.283
Do what?

11:42.035 --> 11:44.037
You know what.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.081
We'll paint the waterfall
another weekend, okay?

11:49.208 --> 11:51.878
Close my door.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.387
That's enough for today.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.473
Wait, what?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.476
Hey, Eddie.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.855
They spelled her name wrong, Daveed.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.233
- It says "John."
- Oh.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.569
- Says "John."
- Yeah.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.738
- Her name is fucking Joan.
- Look, we...

12:18.738 --> 12:20.907
- We could get it fixed.
- No.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.909
I got to wait a week
for it to heal first.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.078
I got seven more days of "John."

12:25.078 --> 12:27.080
The chutist has been identified

12:27.080 --> 12:28.873
as Andrew Thornton
of Paris, Kentucky.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.209
- Wait, is that us?
- Hey.

12:31.209 --> 12:35.046
Listen, Syd is worried
about you, all right?

12:35.046 --> 12:37.632
Says you haven't seen Gabe
in weeks.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.261
I'm so sad, man.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.973
I'm so fucking sad.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.808
Okay?

12:52.730 --> 12:55.483
Can I get the, uh...
the penne, please?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.278
Does it come with chicken,
or is it just, uh...

12:59.278 --> 13:01.280
It's just plain.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.544
I knew you'd be late.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.754
It finally came in.
Check it out.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.631
How many weeks' allowance
is that?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.675
Like a thousand, but worth it.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.510
- Can I use the toilet?
- Uh, no.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.595
My mom is gonna be home soon.

13:24.595 --> 13:28.766
And we got to go if we want
to get to the falls by lunch.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.727
Why by lunch?

13:30.727 --> 13:32.395
The light, Henry.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.523
But I got to go pee.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.941
Go outside.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.818
Why do I skip school with you?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.362
You're bossier than
the teachers.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.947
Now, the adoption people--

13:42.947 --> 13:45.116
I'm not sure who I talked to
over there--

13:45.116 --> 13:47.326
told me I was supposed to be
getting me a Lab.

13:47.326 --> 13:51.122
A fun one, a...
a man's-best-friend type.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.832
I don't know
if there was an error,

13:52.832 --> 13:55.668
because the one I got
is just kind of...

13:55.668 --> 13:57.503
Bob?
- ...I don't know,

13:57.503 --> 13:59.005
just kind of fancy.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.716
Bob, Captain says
it's time to go. -Got it.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.218
Hey, look, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.096
Hey, Reba.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.348
You got plans for tonight?

14:10.183 --> 14:12.977
Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.772
- I just don't...
- Mind looking after Rosette?

14:17.106 --> 14:18.691
- Oh.
- I have to go to Georgia

14:18.691 --> 14:19.942
for the Thornton case,

14:19.942 --> 14:21.652
and you said
you were good at dogs.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.404
I said I had a dog.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.199
You don't have jurisdiction
in Georgia.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.909
A trucker overheard
a couple of guys

14:27.909 --> 14:29.368
talking at a bar last night.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.246
- I'll tell you in the car.
- No, no, no.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.040
Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.001
Oh, come on. You got to be
sort of good with them.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.253
I only had her for a day.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.797
Please?

14:40.797 --> 14:43.382
Uh, I don't know if I could
trust anyone else around here.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.220
Just go.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.930
We'll be fine.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.224
Thanks.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.228
Can't believe
I left the backpack.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.105
I can. I know the way.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.940
School's gonna call, you know.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.942
You know what? Let 'em.

15:00.942 --> 15:03.402
And your mom's gonna be pissed.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.946
So's your dad.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.739
He doesn't care if I play hooky.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.324
For a girl who likes
to be left alone,

15:08.324 --> 15:10.076
you do a lot of shit
for attention.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.744
Look, I'm not
ditching for attention.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.079
I just want to paint
the waterfall.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.413
Admit it.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.415
You want her to find out
and worry about you.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.073
- Jesus! Fuck!

15:49.824 --> 15:51.200
Coral, it's Sari.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.827
Is Dee Dee over there?

15:52.827 --> 15:54.787
School just called.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.122
No.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.457
Yeah, well, can you just
put Elliot on?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.377
Yes, well, his daughter
just ditched school,

16:01.377 --> 16:04.255
so can you please
just put him on?

16:06.090 --> 16:08.301
Every time I call,
he's in the bathroom.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.636
What the hell is wrong with him?

16:11.554 --> 16:13.472
Never mind.

16:35.036 --> 16:38.998

16:41.417 --> 16:45.922

17:05.441 --> 17:07.860

17:07.860 --> 17:09.695
- on the ground, now, am I?
- No, ma'am.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.073
You one of those kids
caused me a bunch of shit?

17:12.073 --> 17:14.242
- What?
- Empty your pockets.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.702
Vest pocket. Come on.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.958
Is that perfume?

17:21.958 --> 17:23.834
That's none of your business.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.170
Well, it smells really nice.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.714
Yeah, well, it's European.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.049
Oh.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.592
Yeah, I'm expecting someone
in a minute.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.511
Is it too much?

17:33.511 --> 17:34.595
Not at all.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.888
Smells expensive.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.558
Well, it is.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.394
You want a sucker?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.271
Sure.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.563
I like the green one.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.232
This is a red one.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.818
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.613
Oh, shit. He's here.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.750
Am I in the right place?

18:07.253 --> 18:09.255
Oh! Right.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.923
Told you it was big.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.591
Oh, it's big.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.719
What's that smell?

18:14.719 --> 18:16.095
It's European.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.641
Someone been smoking?

18:20.641 --> 18:22.268
Um, he was.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.602
- Can you believe it?
- What?

18:23.602 --> 18:24.937
You know,
cigarettes kill people.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.689
- Yeah, but...
- And animals.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.984
Forest fires are the number one
cause of death for wildlife.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.111
Yeah, and y-you should be
educating yourself

18:32.111 --> 18:34.280
instead of endangering
the entire ecosystem.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.032
Just get out of here.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.617
- Get out.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.745
Unbelievable.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.040
You got a dusty beaver here, Ranger.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.125
Yeah, well, I'm working on that.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.233
Hey, Henry!

19:11.233 --> 19:14.111
It looks like the deer
on this sign are doing it!

19:14.111 --> 19:15.654
Hold on.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.867
Seriously, what the hell
are you even doing?

19:20.868 --> 19:22.286
Marking our territory.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.163
Ugh! Don't shit out here!

19:24.163 --> 19:27.833
I'm not shitting.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.589
Hey. Did your mom pack
double lunch for school again?

19:33.589 --> 19:36.175
My dad didn't have a chance
to make any.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.843
Hey, Henry.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.730
Check it out.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.777
It's drugs, I think.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.404
It's drugs?

19:56.404 --> 19:58.572
Remember that guy from assembly?

19:58.572 --> 20:01.700
He showed us pictures of stuff
that looked just like this.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.619
Yeah. The guy from Vietnam
with no legs.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.246
No.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.540
This is definitely cocaine.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.041
Yeah. Of course.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.877
I'm just not used to
seeing it like that.

20:11.877 --> 20:15.965
You know, it's usually
more powdery on the streets.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.218
When have you seen cocaine
on the streets?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.553
When I do it.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.679
Oh, yeah?

20:21.679 --> 20:22.763
With who?

20:22.763 --> 20:24.223
With Faulk.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.558
After church.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.560
Faulk does not do cocaine
after church.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.186
Are you friends with Faulk?

20:29.186 --> 20:30.354
No. He's a pervert.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.814
Then you wouldn't know.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.065
Liar.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.317
You're just mad
you're never invited.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.361
I don't care I'm not invited.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.613
Sounds like you care.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.408
Do some, then.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.703
What?

20:45.703 --> 20:47.830
You've done it before.
You can do it again.

20:47.830 --> 20:51.750
Well, uh, we're exercising,
though. Shooting and stuff.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.879
I mean, I can't do cocaine
while shooting and exercising.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.464
That wouldn't be good.

20:56.464 --> 20:57.756
Fine.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.258
Knife me.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.728
Okay, so how do I do it?

21:11.687 --> 21:12.897
You eat it.

21:13.856 --> 21:14.940
How much?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.610
Like a tablespoon's worth.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.247
Oh!

21:30.247 --> 21:33.209
-  Son of a bitch!

21:33.209 --> 21:36.295
Oh, what the hell?

21:37.171 --> 21:39.048
- Rookie.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.718
You do it, then.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.595
Ugh.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.819
- Ah, shit!

22:00.819 --> 22:02.655
What the hell?

22:02.655 --> 22:05.032
This isn't as good
as the shit I normally do.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.954
Ugh!

22:11.330 --> 22:13.666
How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

22:13.666 --> 22:15.626
Let's sell drugs together.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.963
Yeah, we could sell them on
the street like you and Faulk.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.674
There's more.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.177
Ow.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.848
Something got into it.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.308
A deer, maybe.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.519
Could you imagine that?
Deer on cocaine?

22:33.519 --> 22:35.020
It'd be like this.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.815
Yeah, it'd be, like,
going into trees like-- bang!

22:37.815 --> 22:39.567
- Bang!
- Yep, and then it'd get stuck.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.027
Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.197
Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think
my dad has ever done cocaine?

22:45.197 --> 22:48.158
Your dad has definitely
done cocaine.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.705
My throat's really runny.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.793
Stop that.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.558
Did it do the cocaine?

23:12.558 --> 23:15.394
Don't move a muscle.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.152
Listen to me.

23:23.152 --> 23:26.405
You were supposed to grab Eddie,
not run your mouth.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.532
Now we have trouble.
You understand? -Got it.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.701
- I'll take care of it.

23:30.701 --> 23:32.870
Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.205

24:10.449 --> 24:14.036
She said he sang with the soul

24:18.207 --> 24:20.209

24:20.209 --> 24:24.463

24:30.010 --> 24:31.845
No, I could've did more.

24:31.845 --> 24:32.971
It's fine.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.056
I should've been there.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.391
I didn't need you there.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.725
I don't hang out
with drug dealers anymore.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.310
It's against my constitution.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.270
I'm more than a drug dealer.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.564
- No, you're not.
- Come on, Eddie.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.024
We're friends, right?

24:44.024 --> 24:45.109
No.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.027
Fine.

24:48.237 --> 24:50.364
I think he's happy she's dead.

24:50.364 --> 24:51.824
He's not happy she died.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.326
Blamed her for me leaving
the family business,

24:54.326 --> 24:57.162
if we can call it that.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.956
Sometimes...

24:58.956 --> 25:01.333
- I wonder if he did it to her.
- What?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.085
No, Joanie died of cancer.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.336
I know.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.422
Maybe he gave her the cancer.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.840
You can't give no one cancer.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.508
Yes, you can. With stress.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.552
Stop protecting him.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.470
You know what?
Maybe I should turn this off.

I'm wearing the stuff.

25:39.413 --> 25:42.082
Oh. Did either of you
see a girl,

25:42.082 --> 25:43.917
13, come through here?
My daughter...

25:43.917 --> 25:45.961
You lost your daughter
in the park.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.589
Well, she came here on her own,
heading to the waterfall.

25:48.589 --> 25:51.675
Yeah. Hikers under 16 must be
accompanied by an adult.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.510
Well, I didn't know
she was coming here.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.137
You know, we get
a lot of runaways,

25:55.137 --> 25:57.598
bad apples,
youngsters who aren't too happy

25:57.598 --> 25:59.141
with the way things are at home.

25:59.141 --> 26:00.476
She's not a runaway.

26:00.476 --> 26:01.894
She just came to paint the...

26:01.894 --> 26:03.395
Can someone just please point me

26:03.395 --> 26:04.730
in the direction
of Blood Mountain?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.774
This is Blood Mountain.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.108
- Sorry. I-I'm Peter.
Oh.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.693
This is Peter,
wildlife inspection rep.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.571
We're about to head up there ourselves.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.989
Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?

26:13.989 --> 26:15.532
Now, Peter,
the wildlife inspection

26:15.532 --> 26:16.909
is a very important process.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.452
We wouldn't want you distracted

26:18.452 --> 26:20.412
by our little
damsel in distress here.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.955
Nothing can distract me

26:21.955 --> 26:24.583
from making sure
the entire biological community

26:24.583 --> 26:26.376
is safe for all our friends.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.003
Friends?

26:28.003 --> 26:29.963
- He means animals.
- I don't like that word.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.424
He doesn't like
to call them animals.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.843
Well, I won't be a burden.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.597
I'll get my hat.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.099
Okay.

26:45.395 --> 26:46.980
Shoes okay for hiking?

26:46.980 --> 26:48.899
Oh, yeah.
I-I think I'll be okay.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.776
I have on boots.
- Yep.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.444
Come on, Eddie.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.154
I'm done playing this game.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.405
You-you wanted...

26:55.405 --> 26:56.990
You were the one
who wanted to play this.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.951
You still have
three more questions.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.119
Listen.
What?

27:02.830 --> 27:04.373
I'm tired of playing
this fucking game.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.124
No, you're not.
You just don't want to lose.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.961
I'm-a go in here
and take a piss, all right?

27:13.715 --> 27:16.552
I didn't know
rangers carried guns.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.971
Park rangers are peace officers.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.306
Which means we can shoot people.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.767
Forest is a dangerous place.

27:23.767 --> 27:26.019
That gang of pubes
are dangerous.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.396
"Gang of pubes"?

27:27.396 --> 27:28.772
Teens. Delinquents.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.318
They've been attacking hikers.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.820
They hurt anyone?

27:34.820 --> 27:37.114
They cut them with a knife.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.492
Call themselves the Doochamps.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.369
Watch your back.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.998
Pop-art punks
pop up out of nowhere.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.375
Out of nowhere.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.307
Fuck is this?

28:04.683 --> 28:07.394
He's afraid, buds.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.187
Empty your pockets.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.606
No.

28:10.606 --> 28:13.191
Empty your pockets, please.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.696
Since you asked so nicely.

28:19.740 --> 28:22.492
You think this is a joke?

28:22.492 --> 28:24.077
I do.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.871
Get him, buds.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.539
I'm shaking
a fucking knife, man. Come on.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.374
Just stab him. -Come on, man.
It's a fucking knife!

28:29.374 --> 28:30.959
- Go on!

28:34.004 --> 28:35.881
Oh!

28:35.881 --> 28:37.382
Come on, Rocky. Come on, Rocky.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.967
- Come on, Rocky.
- Ah! Banzai!

28:41.011 --> 28:43.221
Give me this fucking board!

28:44.890 --> 28:46.725
You're going down, man!

28:53.607 --> 28:55.484
Submit! Submit!

28:55.484 --> 28:56.902
What the...

28:59.738 --> 29:01.406
Hold this!

29:01.406 --> 29:03.867
Aah! Fucking skateboard!

29:16.254 --> 29:17.714
Oh, my.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.647
The fuck is wrong with y'all?!

29:33.647 --> 29:35.273
Shit!

29:36.274 --> 29:37.776
I love this road.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.319
Ah, love it up there.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.446
So, wait, where is it
that you wanted to go again?

29:41.446 --> 29:42.948
What? The falls.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.324
The Secret Falls. Right, well,
we can go up this way

29:44.324 --> 29:45.951
- or take the loop.
I love the loop.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.661
Well, you can see
the top of the...

29:47.661 --> 29:49.621
This is a more direct...

29:49.621 --> 29:51.498
All right. We're going this way.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.166
Well, crap.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.752
Told you she shouldn't
have come with us.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.838
Just distracting you completely.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.339
She can hear you.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.925
I wanted to get up
to see the sunset.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.470
- What's taking you so long?

30:05.470 --> 30:07.431
What'd you do?

30:17.315 --> 30:19.776
Please tell me
you found them like this.

30:19.776 --> 30:20.819
They attacked me.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.987
Are they dead?

30:21.987 --> 30:23.363
Well, one might be.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.866
The-the one that stabbed me
might be dead.

30:27.868 --> 30:30.954
Jesus Chr... They're kids.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.290
I loved this fucking jersey, man.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.750
Okay, they're fine.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.877
Thank God.

30:36.877 --> 30:38.503
No fucking way.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.840
Daveed?

30:49.473 --> 30:50.682
What happened?

30:50.682 --> 30:51.767
Hey.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.018
- Wake up.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.561
Where'd you find this?

30:54.561 --> 30:56.021
Whoa.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.648
Where is this energy
coming from, bud?

30:58.648 --> 31:00.192
You tried to fucking kill me.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.652
You got a foul mouth there, bud.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.821
I tell him that all the time.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.740
Where did you find this?

31:06.740 --> 31:08.533
Up on the mountain.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.618
Where's the rest of it?

31:09.618 --> 31:11.495
I don't know.

31:11.495 --> 31:15.165
Listen, I just took out
the three of you in 15 seconds.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.708
What do you think I'll do
to just you

31:16.708 --> 31:18.919
when you're already
on the floor?

31:18.919 --> 31:20.962
Okay. Okay.

31:20.962 --> 31:23.715
We stashed it under a gazebo.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.592
Going back for it later tonight.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.552
A gazebo?

31:27.552 --> 31:30.722
It's a pavilion-type structure.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.516
I know what the fuck
a gazebo is.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.351
I didn't.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.229
Are my buds dead?

31:37.229 --> 31:38.897
- Show us where.
- Oh, God.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.066
You know,
I-I'm feeling kind of tired.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.567
I think I should rest.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.569
Okay. Want a dirt nap?

31:44.569 --> 31:45.987
Eddie, go get the gun.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.405
It's in the glove.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.740
I prefer we left guns
out of this.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.700
Yeah. Same.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.745
And I would prefer
not to be stabbed.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.623
So, Eddie, please go get
the fucking gun.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.416
Okay.

31:59.501 --> 32:00.919
Okay.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.087
All right, all right.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.089
All right, I'm coming.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.174
Relax.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.102
It's getting real cold out.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.661
Let's go.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.790
So, where you guys from?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.500
Shut up. Keep walking.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.128
Gonna be a long hike
if we can't talk to each other.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.130
It better not be a long hike.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.464
Friend's
pretty serious, ain't he?

32:46.464 --> 32:48.133
Well, I don't think
he's too happy

32:48.133 --> 32:49.801
after getting stabbed
in the shoulder.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.636
Well, it wasn't me.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.138
Eh, I don't blame him, though.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.639
Getting stabbed sucks.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.099
Hey, shut the fuck up.

32:57.559 --> 33:00.604
♪ Well, you're too hot ta trot,

33:01.354 --> 33:03.398

33:12.324 --> 33:14.201
Yeah, Reba, it's Bob.

33:14.201 --> 33:17.078
I was wondering
how Rosette is doing.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.372
Realized I hadn't said
a proper goodbye.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.957
I...

33:20.957 --> 33:24.669
I don't know if dogs think about
that sort of thing, but, uh...

33:25.921 --> 33:28.423
Anyway, I...

33:30.342 --> 33:32.385
Thanks again for helping out.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.012
Bye.

33:36.056 --> 33:37.641
Look at this.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.017
Oh, no.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.269
Look at this mess.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.313
People don't have any respect.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.273
This is gonna end up
in scat, this plastic.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.566
I... Let me pick that up.

33:46.566 --> 33:48.860
- All right. Thank you, Ranger.
- Dee Dee!

33:48.860 --> 33:50.820
That is sticking.
- I got some oil in the car.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.030
Dee Dee! Henry!

33:52.030 --> 33:53.531
'Cause if that stays open,

33:53.531 --> 33:55.367
- critters can get in there.
- Oh, yeah, critters.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.452
What kind of critters? Huh?

33:57.452 --> 33:59.079
- Squirrels?
- Squirrels could get in there.

33:59.079 --> 34:01.289
Chipmunks?
- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.916
- Dee Dee!
Uh, skunks.

34:02.916 --> 34:04.376
Raccoon, you know,
little burglar.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.211
- That's right.
- Got his own little mask on.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.212
Yeah, with their cute little
outfit. -I think they're cute.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.672
Uh, skunks.

34:08.672 --> 34:09.839
Skunks. Hmm.

34:09.839 --> 34:10.966
- Possums.
Possums.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.133
- Definitely possums.
- Possum.

34:12.133 --> 34:14.219
- Uh...
- Hey, possum.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.388
Mrs. McKinndry!

34:16.388 --> 34:17.764
Henry?

34:17.764 --> 34:19.557
Here! Hello?

34:19.557 --> 34:20.809
Henry?

34:20.809 --> 34:22.394
Up here!

34:24.229 --> 34:26.398
Hey. Whoa.
Oh.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.358
Henry, what are you
doing up there?

34:28.358 --> 34:29.442
No.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.236
- No, that's not safe at all.
No.

34:31.236 --> 34:33.405
It's too high.
You got to come down.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.489
Get down here.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.284
Don't be mad,
but we skipped school.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.119
- No shit, Henry.
It's high.

34:39.119 --> 34:40.662
But there was a bear.

34:40.662 --> 34:41.997
A really terrible bear.

34:41.997 --> 34:43.456
- A bear?
- Yeah, I know.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.583
- It was fucked!
Hey!

34:45.583 --> 34:47.377
That's inappropriate.

34:47.377 --> 34:50.755
Sorry for cussing,
but it attacked me and Dee Dee.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.215
It attacked you?

34:52.215 --> 34:54.217
- Henry, where is Dee Dee?
No, no.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.219
Bears are
very peaceful creatures.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.929
You must have done something
to upset it.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.889
- Yeah, did you feed it?
- What did you do?

34:59.889 --> 35:01.975
Nothing! Y'all need to hide!

35:01.975 --> 35:04.811
I'm telling you,
it's not just any bear!

35:04.811 --> 35:06.855
You have to listen to me!

35:06.855 --> 35:08.732
Henry, where is Dee Dee?

35:08.732 --> 35:10.275
The monster took her.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.611
Now, I'm not gonna
tell you again, little girl.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.238
Get down here now.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.782
- A...

35:17.782 --> 35:19.909
- I...

35:19.909 --> 35:21.619
Dee Dee!

35:38.636 --> 35:40.680
Whoa!

35:42.640 --> 35:43.933
Peter!

35:43.933 --> 35:45.810
-  No!
- Peter!

35:50.023 --> 35:52.192
Oh! Oh, no!

35:52.192 --> 35:54.027
It let me go! He ran off!

35:54.027 --> 35:57.238
- Henry, jump down.
- It's too high.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.698
Is it gone?

35:58.698 --> 36:00.617
Do you see it?

36:08.041 --> 36:09.417
Yeah.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.711
Why are you shooting at me?

36:11.711 --> 36:12.921
Get your ass down!

36:12.921 --> 36:14.339
This is your fault.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.882
Right behind you. I saw it.

36:17.092 --> 36:18.343
Stay down.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.187
What?

36:46.788 --> 36:48.289
Help me!

36:49.082 --> 36:50.959
Help!

36:55.255 --> 36:58.049
Ranger! Ranger!

36:58.049 --> 36:59.426
Did it get you?

36:59.426 --> 37:01.970
That asshole!

37:01.970 --> 37:03.263
I'm gonna get him.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.806
I'm gonna get that asshole.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.394
I'll get help.

37:09.394 --> 37:10.895
Where are you going?

37:10.895 --> 37:12.230
God Almighty.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.399
Hey. What...

37:15.900 --> 37:17.402
Where is it?

37:18.987 --> 37:20.613
Hey!

37:23.032 --> 37:24.826
What should I do?

37:24.826 --> 37:26.327
Motherfucker!

37:26.327 --> 37:27.745
Come back! Help us!

37:30.039 --> 37:31.999
Oh, fuck!

37:37.172 --> 37:38.590
There's something wrong with it.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.175
Yeah, I told you there was.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.385
Why is it acting like this?

37:42.385 --> 37:44.429
Did you feed it cocaine?

37:44.429 --> 37:46.806
No. But you're safe.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.766
Bears can't climb trees.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.059
Of course they can!

37:50.059 --> 37:52.020
Then why are you up here?

38:17.504 --> 38:20.465
It's okay. It's okay.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.526
Okay.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.001
No.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.257
Henry, climb. Henry, go.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.676
Climb! Climb!
You got to get higher!

39:04.676 --> 39:06.219
- Climb.
Go, Henry!

39:06.219 --> 39:07.512
Go!

39:07.512 --> 39:09.639
- Henry, move!
- Go higher!

39:12.183 --> 39:13.518
Go up!

39:13.518 --> 39:15.603
Henry, go!

39:15.603 --> 39:17.480
Oh, God.

39:19.274 --> 39:20.984
Go, Henry! No!
- Whoa!

39:20.984 --> 39:22.193
No!

39:22.193 --> 39:24.237
Oh, God. Henry!

39:39.168 --> 39:41.129
Oh, God.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.632
Oh, shit.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.346
No, no, no, no!

39:52.890 --> 39:55.476
Get off of me! No, no!

39:55.476 --> 39:57.812
- Get off! Get off of me!

40:03.985 --> 40:06.029
Henry, jump! Jump down!

40:06.029 --> 40:08.114
- Move, Henry!

40:14.579 --> 40:16.831
It's okay. It's okay.
You're doing great.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.417
You're almost there.
Come on, baby.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.753
- Come on. Let's go.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.713
Come on.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.901
Go. Hide. Come here. Come here.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.574
That was so messed up.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.994
That little man
was an expert on bears

40:54.994 --> 40:57.955
but didn't know the bear
was the cocaine bear.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.666
Wait. What did you say?

40:59.666 --> 41:01.125
We found cocaine,
Mrs. McKinndry.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.960
There was cocaine in the forest,
and the bear ate it

41:02.960 --> 41:05.463
and then went crazy
on me and Dee Dee

41:05.463 --> 41:07.965
and now on that guy back there.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.842
Did you hear him scream?

41:09.842 --> 41:12.095
He's so dead.

41:12.095 --> 41:14.597
I'd love to not remember that.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.599
But it kind of seems like

41:16.599 --> 41:19.143
the thing that stays
with a man forever.

41:20.103 --> 41:23.314
Henry, when the bear
took Dee Dee, was she...

41:23.314 --> 41:25.316
Alive? Yeah.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.984
It chased her that way.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.821
We got to go. Let's go.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.158
He get at you, too?

41:34.158 --> 41:36.994
- Fucking beast.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.789
- Call an ambulance.
- I already did.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.584
Keep him awake.

41:43.584 --> 41:46.045
Yeah, I've been trying.

42:01.394 --> 42:03.563
You piles of shit!

42:03.563 --> 42:06.149
- You're the Doochamps!
- Hey, that's-that's not ours.

42:06.149 --> 42:07.817
We found it.

42:10.486 --> 42:12.739
"It's not ours."

42:13.614 --> 42:15.199
I'm a park ranger.

42:15.199 --> 42:17.368
- I'm not dumb.
- I know.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.036
They say I can't keep
my park safe,

42:19.036 --> 42:21.539
that I'm unfit
for the big leagues.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.458
I'd have been
at Yellowstone by now

42:23.458 --> 42:24.542
if it weren't for you shits!

42:24.542 --> 42:26.043
- Buds.
Huh?

42:26.043 --> 42:28.921
There's someone outside.

42:28.921 --> 42:31.716
It's him. Get to the door.
Get to the door.

42:31.716 --> 42:32.925
- Yeah.

42:32.925 --> 42:36.846
Now, uh, open it
when I-I count to three.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.848
Wait, wait.
But you're gonna shoot him?

42:38.848 --> 42:40.349
Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!

42:40.349 --> 42:41.768
He took a bite out of my ass!

42:41.768 --> 42:44.187
What the fuck is wrong
with this guy?

42:45.605 --> 42:47.899
Now, open it when I say so.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.736
Now.

42:54.405 --> 42:56.616
That's a fucking bear.

43:02.455 --> 43:04.624
What the fuck?!

43:12.423 --> 43:13.591
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.926
- You're sorry?
- I'm sorry.

43:14.926 --> 43:17.345
- Where'd the bear go?
- You killed him.

43:17.345 --> 43:18.429
Where's the bear?!

43:18.429 --> 43:20.181
- I don't know!
- Close the door!

43:20.181 --> 43:23.976
- Close the motherfucking door.
-  Jesus Christ.

43:23.976 --> 43:26.229
Close the door.

43:27.480 --> 43:30.316
Oh, God. I'm sorry, bud.

43:36.113 --> 43:39.242
Keep your mouth shut.
Check over there.

44:01.973 --> 44:04.392
Shh.

44:07.562 --> 44:09.522
He's up there.

44:09.522 --> 44:10.982
He's up there.

44:41.220 --> 44:44.807
I got it. I got it.

44:54.984 --> 44:56.694
Maybe the kid can help you.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.863
Look, I'm done
playing this game.

44:58.863 --> 45:00.698
- What game?
- 20 questions.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.200
Daveed's so fucking cold.
It's unbelievable.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.703
- What did he ask so far?
- He just keeps guessing.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.830
Like, "Is it a spider?

45:07.830 --> 45:09.874
- Is it an arrow?"

45:09.874 --> 45:12.251
What are you, new?

45:13.252 --> 45:15.254
Hey, start broad,
then narrow it down.

45:15.254 --> 45:16.547
Everybody knows that.

45:16.547 --> 45:18.341
Look, are we close
to the gazebo?

45:18.341 --> 45:19.926
Is that one of your questions?

45:19.926 --> 45:21.636
Oh, is it bigger
than a bread box?

45:21.636 --> 45:23.888
No, no, no. Daveed needs to ask.

45:24.764 --> 45:27.224
Ask him if it's bigger
than a bread box.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.937
Is it bigger than a bread box?

45:32.229 --> 45:33.397
- Yes.
- Whoo!

45:33.397 --> 45:34.732
Yeah!

45:34.732 --> 45:36.525
Is it Abraham Lincoln?

45:36.525 --> 45:38.694
What? No.

45:38.694 --> 45:41.906
Broad, then narrow it down, man.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.075
You have one question left.

46:39.755 --> 46:42.842
Dee Dee! Dee Dee!

46:42.842 --> 46:44.468
You sure this is the way?

46:44.468 --> 46:46.554
Pretty sure.

46:51.851 --> 46:53.644
Dee Dee! It's okay.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.312
It's Mama.

46:56.647 --> 46:58.816
Oh.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.527
Thank God.

47:01.527 --> 47:03.487
- Ew! What the heck?

47:03.487 --> 47:05.781
It's paint. It's just red paint.

47:05.781 --> 47:08.325
It looks a lot like blood.
How can you be sure?

47:08.325 --> 47:10.286
I'm a nurse, Henry.

47:10.286 --> 47:11.996
Good point.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.874
Come on.

47:19.211 --> 47:21.172
Oh, smart girl.

47:23.174 --> 47:25.426
Henry, come on.
She left us a trail.

47:25.426 --> 47:28.679
Mrs. McKinndry,
have you ever done cocaine?

47:28.679 --> 47:30.347
What?

47:30.347 --> 47:32.516
Why do you ask?

47:32.516 --> 47:35.019
Just wondering if it has
long-term side effects--

47:35.019 --> 47:38.272
for the bear, of course,
if it just did a little bit.

47:38.272 --> 47:41.692
Well, it could create
a habit for the bear.

47:41.692 --> 47:44.195
What if they never want
to do it again?

47:44.195 --> 47:46.864
Oh, then it-it should be fine.

47:46.864 --> 47:49.742
But Mama Bear and Papa Bear
would be very angry

47:49.742 --> 47:51.994
because drugs--
especially cocaine--

47:51.994 --> 47:54.163
are very, very bad.

47:54.163 --> 47:55.915
What if they would
never find out?

47:55.915 --> 47:57.541
Oh, Henry.

47:57.541 --> 47:59.752
We always find out.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.402
You said they called in
a concussion.

49:08.279 --> 49:09.989
They did.

54:33.353 --> 54:35.063
but I practiced
conversation starters

54:35.063 --> 54:36.857
on that lizard every day.

54:36.857 --> 54:40.027
And then
that's how I met Rocky and Joe.

54:41.445 --> 54:42.946
That's my team, man.

54:42.946 --> 54:46.366
We're planning on moving
to New York City together.

54:47.117 --> 54:50.287
Those are my buds, man.

54:50.287 --> 54:52.915
So I should get Gabe a lizard?

54:52.915 --> 54:55.626
Well, you know what?

54:55.626 --> 54:59.296
Lizards are good listeners, bud,

54:59.296 --> 55:01.340
but people...

55:01.340 --> 55:03.926
people are good at hearing.

55:07.763 --> 55:11.141
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard. Thank you.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.768
- Can we...
- It's okay.

55:12.768 --> 55:14.895
Y'all are hugging.

55:14.895 --> 55:17.356
It's okay.

55:20.150 --> 55:22.069
Where the fuck is the gazebo?

56:35.601 --> 56:39.438
Can I say something without you
getting angry with me?

56:40.564 --> 56:42.899
I'm already angry with you.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.071
It's gone.

56:49.031 --> 56:50.407
What the actual...

56:50.407 --> 56:51.908
-  No! Please, please!
- Daveed, stop.

56:51.908 --> 56:53.452
No, no, no. The kid's
messing with us, Eddie.

56:53.452 --> 56:54.828
No, no, no! I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!

56:54.828 --> 56:56.496
I-I promise.
I-I don't know where it went.

56:56.496 --> 56:57.873
It's just gone.

56:57.873 --> 57:00.042
Okay, well,
duffel bags don't have legs.

57:00.042 --> 57:02.252
Since you're the only one
that knew where it was,

57:02.252 --> 57:04.504
I'm-a give you one more chance.

57:04.504 --> 57:06.131
Where's the ba...

57:06.131 --> 57:09.092
Put the gun down
and move away from the teenager.

57:10.719 --> 57:15.432
Drop the weapon and step away
about five to ten paces.

57:15.432 --> 57:18.018
All right, listen.
Just calm down, all right?

57:18.018 --> 57:19.436
I ain't fucking around.

57:20.187 --> 57:22.606
Just do it.

57:24.274 --> 57:25.942
Fuck.

57:26.818 --> 57:29.029
- You don't want to do this.
- Shut up!

57:29.029 --> 57:31.698
I'm coming down there.

57:38.455 --> 57:40.624
Uh...

57:43.043 --> 57:46.838
Uh...

57:48.465 --> 57:51.176
- Uh...

57:51.176 --> 57:52.135
Shh!

57:52.135 --> 57:54.137
I'm just trying to...

57:54.137 --> 57:56.264
find a safe spot to hop down.

57:56.264 --> 57:57.974
How did you get up there?

57:57.974 --> 58:00.310
Well, I jumped from that tree
over there, but...

58:00.310 --> 58:01.812
I hurt my hip a little.

58:01.812 --> 58:03.522
I can try to catch you
if you want.

58:03.522 --> 58:07.109
No, no!
You stay right where you are!

58:08.318 --> 58:10.153
Let's, uh, see, uh...

58:10.153 --> 58:11.446
Get it.

58:13.448 --> 58:15.951
Fuck!

58:15.951 --> 58:17.327
Fuck!

58:18.704 --> 58:20.330
Well, you brought that
on yourself, kid.

58:20.330 --> 58:23.166
Oh, yeah?
I shot my own fucking fingers?

58:23.166 --> 58:24.710
I told you not to move.

58:24.710 --> 58:27.796
How'd he take
those two fingers off?

58:27.796 --> 58:29.840
They're not even
next to each other.

58:31.508 --> 58:33.176
Fuck you!

58:34.469 --> 58:36.012
Come out of there!

58:36.012 --> 58:37.597
Shit! Come on out!

58:37.597 --> 58:39.516
No fucking way!

58:41.143 --> 58:42.894
God! Goddamn it!

58:44.187 --> 58:46.189
You two, on your bellies.

58:46.189 --> 58:48.233
Now! And no more moving.

58:49.526 --> 58:51.319
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

58:51.319 --> 58:52.612
Can you grab them for me?

58:52.612 --> 58:54.030
Can I grab his fingers?

58:54.030 --> 58:55.699
Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.

58:56.908 --> 58:58.744
Slow. Slow.

59:01.538 --> 59:02.706
Easy.

59:02.706 --> 59:04.249
Ugh, God.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.711
All right.

59:07.711 --> 59:09.337
Now, you get back on your belly.

59:09.337 --> 59:11.214
I'll hold on to these.

59:17.262 --> 59:18.930
Now, where you at?

59:20.307 --> 59:22.058
Shit.

59:23.393 --> 59:24.603
What?

59:24.603 --> 59:26.146
Oh, no. The river.

59:28.356 --> 59:30.233
Henry, look.

59:30.233 --> 59:32.235
That's Dee Dee's sweater.

59:32.235 --> 59:34.529
- Come on.
- So we're crossing?

59:34.529 --> 59:36.323
We're on the right track.

59:36.323 --> 59:38.033
I can feel it.

59:54.090 --> 59:56.092
Mama?

59:57.260 --> 59:59.471
Fuck.

59:59.471 --> 1:00:01.306
Fuck, man.

1:00:01.306 --> 1:00:03.767
My fucking jersey, man.

1:00:05.811 --> 1:00:07.938
How long are you gonna
keep us like this?

1:00:07.938 --> 1:00:09.606
Until that guy in the gazebo

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:11.358
throws his weapon
into the woods.

1:00:11.358 --> 1:00:13.318
Well, then we'll be here forever.

1:00:13.318 --> 1:00:15.821
Hasn't Syd already
messed your life up enough?

1:00:15.821 --> 1:00:17.697
We don't need to die
because of this.

1:00:17.697 --> 1:00:19.699
Eddie, I got this.

1:00:19.699 --> 1:00:20.951
Do you?

1:00:20.951 --> 1:00:23.787
I have your fingers
in my pocket.

1:00:23.787 --> 1:00:25.455
You're all gonna get arrested.

1:00:25.455 --> 1:00:27.749
Drug sentences since Nixon
are fucked,

1:00:27.749 --> 1:00:30.502
so get ready for ten to 15 years

1:00:30.502 --> 1:00:32.587
of shitting
in front of your cellmate

1:00:32.587 --> 1:00:34.297
and supervised shower time.

1:00:34.297 --> 1:00:36.800
Detective, Your Honor, sir,
I'm not with them.

1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:38.552
I've never even done coke.

1:00:38.552 --> 1:00:41.638
I mean, maybe once.
Once-- at a party once.

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:43.807
- I can't go to jail.
- You're not going to jail.

1:00:43.807 --> 1:00:45.350
Just saying, I can't shit
in front of people.

1:00:45.350 --> 1:00:47.310
I've never been able to shit
in front of people.

1:00:47.310 --> 1:00:49.229
I like to shit in peace.

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:56.945
Nobody move.

1:00:58.405 --> 1:00:59.698
It's a bear.

1:00:59.698 --> 1:01:01.366
Yeah.

1:01:01.366 --> 1:01:03.118
No, no.

1:01:03.118 --> 1:01:05.996
I'm not falling
for none of your...

1:01:28.685 --> 1:01:30.103
Oh, fuck.

1:01:30.103 --> 1:01:32.355
Hey, y'all just stay still.
Don't move.

1:01:32.355 --> 1:01:33.732
Just play dead.

1:01:59.716 --> 1:02:01.217
Shh.

1:02:27.994 --> 1:02:29.079
Oh, fuck.

1:02:38.254 --> 1:02:39.422
Oh, man. You fucked.

1:02:39.422 --> 1:02:40.548
Eddie, can you breathe?

1:02:40.548 --> 1:02:42.509
What the fuck?

1:02:42.509 --> 1:02:44.094
I think that's a yes.

1:02:44.928 --> 1:02:46.680
Can someone do something?

1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:48.098
Maybe your boy can do something.

1:02:48.098 --> 1:02:51.935
Can you just, like... move it?

1:02:51.935 --> 1:02:54.854
Oh, of course.
Why didn't I think of that?

1:02:58.566 --> 1:03:00.151
Dee Dee!

1:03:00.151 --> 1:03:03.279
Henry, stay close.
I haven't seen paint in a while.

1:03:05.615 --> 1:03:07.283
Oh, God.

1:03:07.283 --> 1:03:09.244
Look.

1:03:09.244 --> 1:03:10.996
Hello.

1:03:12.330 --> 1:03:15.750
- Is he okay?

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:18.628
Help me, please.

1:03:18.628 --> 1:03:20.588
Does he have food?

1:03:20.588 --> 1:03:22.966
Her name was Elsa,

1:03:22.966 --> 1:03:25.385
and she was so beautiful.

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:28.555
Are-are you... are you hurt?

1:03:28.555 --> 1:03:30.807
Were you attacked?

1:03:30.807 --> 1:03:32.559
Devil bear.

1:03:33.518 --> 1:03:34.769
My... I'm looking
for my daughter.

1:03:34.769 --> 1:03:35.979
She was attacked
by the devil bear.

1:03:35.979 --> 1:03:37.188
Have you seen her?

1:03:37.188 --> 1:03:38.732
You have?

1:03:38.732 --> 1:03:40.942
- Was she alive?
Yes.

1:03:40.942 --> 1:03:42.485
Please, can you just point
to where she went?

1:03:42.485 --> 1:03:44.404
Please, can you show me?
I'm looking for her.

1:03:44.404 --> 1:03:45.447
I haven't...

1:03:45.447 --> 1:03:46.990
Henry!

1:03:59.461 --> 1:04:03.173
I'll show you. Come.

1:04:08.511 --> 1:04:10.430
It's not moving.

1:04:11.806 --> 1:04:13.767
I think it died.

1:04:13.767 --> 1:04:15.852
It died on top of me?

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:17.103
Check its pulse.

1:04:17.103 --> 1:04:19.689
Can you, like,
feel it breathing?

1:04:19.689 --> 1:04:22.025
I'm not sure.

1:04:23.610 --> 1:04:26.196
Uh, hey, guy?

1:04:26.196 --> 1:04:27.322
Detective.

1:04:27.322 --> 1:04:28.364
Can we call a truce

1:04:28.364 --> 1:04:30.366
so I can see
if the bear is dead?

1:04:30.366 --> 1:04:31.576
Yeah.

1:04:36.206 --> 1:04:37.332
Fuck.

1:04:41.878 --> 1:04:43.797
You okay?

1:04:43.797 --> 1:04:46.049
What do you think?

1:05:03.441 --> 1:05:05.235
S-Still breathing.

1:05:05.235 --> 1:05:07.570
We should go.

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:09.948
He'll probably be all right.

1:05:09.948 --> 1:05:12.033
What the hell, man?

1:05:12.033 --> 1:05:13.409
He's gonna wake up eventually.

1:05:13.409 --> 1:05:15.453
Well, that's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

1:05:15.453 --> 1:05:16.746
"She."

1:05:16.746 --> 1:05:18.081
What?

1:05:18.081 --> 1:05:19.916
The bear is a girl.

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:21.459
Oh, yeah.
H-How do you know that?

1:05:21.459 --> 1:05:24.546
Because its vagina
is on my ear.

1:05:26.714 --> 1:05:28.466
Oh, shit. She's moving.

1:05:28.466 --> 1:05:29.884
She's awake.

1:05:29.884 --> 1:05:32.262
Oh, shit.
Well, stay back. Stay back.

1:05:32.262 --> 1:05:34.931
Okay.

1:05:39.811 --> 1:05:40.812
Chill out. Just chill out!

1:05:40.812 --> 1:05:42.772
Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.

1:05:42.772 --> 1:05:44.482
- Stay back.

1:05:48.611 --> 1:05:50.113
What the hell?

1:05:50.113 --> 1:05:52.949
Okay. Okay.

1:05:55.493 --> 1:05:58.121
No, no, no, no.
Don't eat that. Don't eat that.

1:05:58.830 --> 1:06:00.790
I will be goddamned.

1:06:00.790 --> 1:06:02.292
Should we shoot her?

1:06:02.292 --> 1:06:05.753
No. Let's see what kind
of effect that has on it.

1:06:07.297 --> 1:06:09.632
What the fuck?

1:06:22.312 --> 1:06:24.981
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:06:24.981 --> 1:06:26.900
- Eddie!
Daveed, help.

1:06:26.900 --> 1:06:29.527
What is this?

1:06:29.527 --> 1:06:30.987
- No, no.

1:06:30.987 --> 1:06:32.739
- Ooh! Okay, I have...
What is it doing?

1:06:32.739 --> 1:06:34.490
I-I don't like this.

1:06:34.490 --> 1:06:35.909
Please stop.

1:06:35.909 --> 1:06:37.994
- Just go limp! Slide down!
- I'm limp already.

1:06:39.746 --> 1:06:41.956
- Shoot the bear! Shoot her!
Don't shoot!

1:06:41.956 --> 1:06:44.125
No, no. Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

1:06:44.125 --> 1:06:45.251
Eddie, you got to fight back,
all right?

1:06:45.251 --> 1:06:46.336
It's-it's playing with you.

1:06:46.336 --> 1:06:47.837
I'd stay still if I were you.

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:50.048
Bud, just tap out, bud.
Bud, tap out!

1:06:50.048 --> 1:06:52.467
Eddie, please don't die
like this. Eddie, please.

1:06:52.467 --> 1:06:53.718
Daveed!

1:06:53.718 --> 1:06:55.511
All we've been through! Come on!

1:06:55.511 --> 1:06:56.846
Come on, help him!

1:06:56.846 --> 1:06:58.848
Get lower. You're not listening!

1:06:58.848 --> 1:07:01.184
- Eddie.

1:07:01.184 --> 1:07:02.977
Oh, my God. He's gonna die.

1:07:05.313 --> 1:07:06.522
No!

1:07:06.522 --> 1:07:08.233
Hey, girl.

1:07:16.866 --> 1:07:18.618
There you go, girl.

1:07:19.702 --> 1:07:21.371
There you go.

1:07:22.956 --> 1:07:24.874
There you go.

1:07:24.874 --> 1:07:28.378
It's like cocaine Christmas.

1:07:43.393 --> 1:07:44.560
Go!

1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:47.480
Don't have to tell me twice.

1:07:49.899 --> 1:07:51.567
Come on!

1:07:51.567 --> 1:07:52.652
Daveed!

1:07:52.652 --> 1:07:54.237
That bag's worth 14 million.

1:07:54.237 --> 1:07:57.240
We had a truce, and a truce
is on God where I'm from.

1:07:57.240 --> 1:08:00.868
Can't you see I'm trying
to help you, kid? Go!

1:08:00.868 --> 1:08:02.578
I need that bag.

1:08:02.578 --> 1:08:04.664
Leave it, man.
Let's just go home.

1:08:04.664 --> 1:08:07.250
We're taking that bag
to Syd, Eddie.

1:08:17.302 --> 1:08:19.262
Shot...

1:08:21.014 --> 1:08:23.182
No. I didn't.

1:08:27.312 --> 1:08:29.272
Run! Go, go!

1:08:30.982 --> 1:08:32.734
Oh, shit!

1:08:46.998 --> 1:08:48.624
Holy shit.

1:08:48.624 --> 1:08:50.752
- Dad. What are you doing here?
Oh, shit.

1:08:50.752 --> 1:08:51.961
Where's Gabe?

1:08:51.961 --> 1:08:53.212
You didn't bring him here,
did you?

1:08:53.212 --> 1:08:54.922
- Calm down.

1:08:54.922 --> 1:08:57.008
He's safe at home watching TV.

1:08:57.008 --> 1:08:58.926
What?
How long has he been alone?

1:08:58.926 --> 1:09:00.511
You left him with me!

1:09:00.511 --> 1:09:03.639
Do I look like
"daddy day care center" to you?

1:09:04.432 --> 1:09:06.309
- Huh?

1:09:07.143 --> 1:09:10.104
- The fuck happened to you?
- A lot.

1:09:10.104 --> 1:09:12.690
- Did you get the coke?
- A little.

1:09:12.690 --> 1:09:14.776
The bear ate most of it.

1:09:14.776 --> 1:09:16.819
- What?
- The bear.

1:09:16.819 --> 1:09:18.780
It fucking did cocaine.

1:09:18.780 --> 1:09:20.281
A fucking...

1:09:20.281 --> 1:09:22.617
A bear did cocaine, Dad!

1:09:22.617 --> 1:09:23.659
Fuck this!

1:09:23.659 --> 1:09:26.788
Seriously,
fuck this entire journey.

1:09:26.788 --> 1:09:28.706
Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.

1:09:28.706 --> 1:09:31.709
Look at me. Look at me.

1:09:31.709 --> 1:09:33.503
I'm on the hook here.

1:09:33.503 --> 1:09:38.341
A lot of cocaine was lost
under my eye.

1:09:38.341 --> 1:09:40.218
And the people that I deal with,

1:09:40.218 --> 1:09:42.720
they don't care how,
just that it was.

1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:44.639
And look at me.

1:09:44.639 --> 1:09:48.184
They're gonna come after me,
my family

1:09:48.184 --> 1:09:51.687
if I don't get them
every penny's worth.

1:09:51.687 --> 1:09:53.606
You hear what I'm saying?

1:09:53.606 --> 1:09:56.567
It's you and Gabe.

1:09:56.567 --> 1:09:58.528
You understand?

1:10:00.446 --> 1:10:02.949
We don't have a choice.

1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:07.328
There's a bag
with the cop and the bear

1:10:07.328 --> 1:10:09.455
over at the pavilion structure.

1:10:11.457 --> 1:10:12.708
Come on.

1:10:15.962 --> 1:10:17.880
Come on, son. Come on.

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:27.390
Who's there?

1:10:27.390 --> 1:10:29.392
Easy.
Stay away.

1:10:29.392 --> 1:10:31.018
Where's the duffel?

1:10:31.018 --> 1:10:32.728
I gave it to the bear.

1:10:32.728 --> 1:10:34.730
You gave it to the bear?

1:10:34.730 --> 1:10:36.858
Yeah. The bear.

1:10:37.859 --> 1:10:39.402
It loves coke.

1:10:40.319 --> 1:10:42.280
Wh-Which way did it go?

1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:44.240
I'm not fucking around here.

1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:46.742
Syd White.

1:10:46.742 --> 1:10:49.287
Man, I've been following you
for years.

1:10:49.287 --> 1:10:51.080
They all have.

1:10:55.918 --> 1:10:58.588
Reba.

1:10:58.588 --> 1:11:01.174
Oh, I always knew
you were my girl.

1:11:01.174 --> 1:11:02.425
I got you now.

1:11:02.425 --> 1:11:04.427
Be careful
when you cuff these guys.

1:11:04.427 --> 1:11:06.012
They're kind of shifty.

1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:12.852
What...

1:11:12.852 --> 1:11:14.437
What are you doing?

1:11:17.190 --> 1:11:20.318
- I'm sorry, Bob.
-  I'm sorry, Bob.

1:11:20.318 --> 1:11:22.195
You shot him?

1:11:22.195 --> 1:11:23.321
I told you not to hurt him.

1:11:23.321 --> 1:11:25.072
I don't work for you.

1:11:25.072 --> 1:11:26.699
The department trusted you.

1:11:26.699 --> 1:11:30.411
The state of Tennessee
trusted you.

1:11:30.411 --> 1:11:35.124
The United States of America,
it trusted you.

1:11:35.124 --> 1:11:36.792
I know.

1:11:36.792 --> 1:11:39.253
- I trusted you with Rosette.
- I know.

1:11:39.253 --> 1:11:41.172
Who's Rosette?

1:11:41.172 --> 1:11:42.423
The dog in my car.

1:11:42.423 --> 1:11:43.966
You left a dog in the car?

1:11:43.966 --> 1:11:45.927
You left my son in Saint Louis.

1:11:45.927 --> 1:11:47.803
How is she?

1:11:55.478 --> 1:11:57.522
She being a good girl?

1:11:57.522 --> 1:12:00.107
Yeah. She's such a good girl.

1:12:00.107 --> 1:12:01.484
E-Enough.

1:12:01.484 --> 1:12:03.611
Tell me which way the bear went,

1:12:03.611 --> 1:12:06.239
or I'm gonna kill the dog
when I come down mountain.

1:12:06.239 --> 1:12:08.741
Oh, no, no, please,
d-don't-don't do that.

1:12:08.741 --> 1:12:11.035
I'd vote for not
killing the dog today,

1:12:11.035 --> 1:12:12.912
but that's just me.

1:12:12.912 --> 1:12:14.664
Well, what do you guys say?

1:12:14.664 --> 1:12:16.999
What's so funny?

1:12:19.210 --> 1:12:21.504
Apex predator,

1:12:21.504 --> 1:12:24.840
high on cocaine,
and you're going towards it.

1:12:31.305 --> 1:12:33.432
Dead north, man.

1:12:33.432 --> 1:12:35.393
- Yes, we will.

1:12:35.393 --> 1:12:38.229
Dead... dead north.

1:12:38.229 --> 1:12:39.897
Let's go.

1:13:21.397 --> 1:13:24.025
The devil bear is in there.

1:13:24.025 --> 1:13:26.569
You can't go in there.

1:13:26.569 --> 1:13:29.071
Do you have kids?

1:13:29.071 --> 1:13:30.573
We would have.

1:13:30.573 --> 1:13:32.325
I have to go find mine.

1:13:32.325 --> 1:13:34.577
And his name would be Texas.

1:13:35.411 --> 1:13:37.079
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yeah.

1:13:42.752 --> 1:13:43.836
Here.

1:13:44.712 --> 1:13:46.088
Thank you.

1:13:46.088 --> 1:13:48.758
Bye, lady and little man.

1:13:48.758 --> 1:13:50.551
Bye, you both.

1:13:52.219 --> 1:13:54.263
Okay.

1:13:54.263 --> 1:13:56.515
Wait. What about me?

1:14:17.244 --> 1:14:19.622
Watch where you step.

1:14:21.374 --> 1:14:23.834
- I got you. Stay close.

1:14:26.170 --> 1:14:28.464
What's that?

1:14:33.177 --> 1:14:34.553
Don't move.

1:14:34.553 --> 1:14:36.180
Stay still, Henry.

1:14:42.436 --> 1:14:44.355
They look like polar bears.

1:14:44.355 --> 1:14:45.731
Henry?

1:14:45.731 --> 1:14:46.691
Dee Dee?

1:14:46.691 --> 1:14:48.150
Dee Dee?
- Mama!

1:14:48.150 --> 1:14:49.944
Don't move. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1:14:49.944 --> 1:14:52.154
No, no. Them, they're...
they're harmless. -Dee Dee!

1:14:52.154 --> 1:14:54.615
- Mama, I just...
- Baby!

1:14:55.408 --> 1:14:56.575
Dee Dee, you're okay.

1:14:56.575 --> 1:14:57.910
Are you hurt?

1:14:57.910 --> 1:14:59.328
- It's just my leg.
- Your leg?

1:14:59.328 --> 1:15:00.746
That looks really deep.

1:15:00.746 --> 1:15:02.998
Here. Don't touch it.
- Ow! Ow! Henry!

1:15:02.998 --> 1:15:04.458
Let's keep you warm.

1:15:04.458 --> 1:15:06.001
Oh, my gosh.
You found my sweater.

1:15:06.001 --> 1:15:07.294
You smart girl.

1:15:07.294 --> 1:15:09.004
- You left us clues.
- Yeah.

1:15:09.004 --> 1:15:10.381
We found you.

1:15:10.381 --> 1:15:11.882
Put that on.

1:15:11.882 --> 1:15:14.885
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I love you so much.

1:15:14.885 --> 1:15:16.387
Oh, my God.

1:15:16.387 --> 1:15:17.847
Mom, I'm-I'm so sorry.

1:15:17.847 --> 1:15:19.098
- I'm sorry. I just...
- It's okay.

1:15:19.098 --> 1:15:20.141
Henry told me everything.

1:15:20.141 --> 1:15:21.684
Everything?

1:15:21.684 --> 1:15:22.893
You mean that
you guys did drugs?

1:15:22.893 --> 1:15:24.562
- You told her?
No.

1:15:24.562 --> 1:15:26.522
I had a suspicion,
and you just confirmed it.

1:15:26.522 --> 1:15:28.816
I'm just so glad I found you
and you're okay.

1:15:28.816 --> 1:15:32.737
- Um, what was that?

1:15:32.737 --> 1:15:34.822
Cocaine bear's back.

1:15:35.614 --> 1:15:37.450
- Can you walk?
- Uh, a little.

1:15:37.450 --> 1:15:38.951
Come on. Let's go, Henry.

1:15:38.951 --> 1:15:40.244
Go that way.

1:15:40.244 --> 1:15:41.495
Go ahead.

1:15:43.205 --> 1:15:45.332
It's okay. Come on.

1:15:45.332 --> 1:15:47.418
Look. It's a way out.

1:15:50.588 --> 1:15:53.132
It's the falls.
Oh, wow.

1:16:02.683 --> 1:16:05.144
Henry, stay away from the ledge!

1:16:05.144 --> 1:16:07.104
Oh, God.

1:16:55.653 --> 1:16:57.988
This is it.

1:17:01.283 --> 1:17:02.910
Syd, let's cut our losses.

1:17:02.910 --> 1:17:05.496
All right? Let's just deal
with the fallout.

1:17:05.496 --> 1:17:08.374
You saw what that bear did
to that hiker.

1:17:11.836 --> 1:17:13.879
What is that?

1:17:15.422 --> 1:17:16.924
- Oh, fuck!

1:17:16.924 --> 1:17:19.176
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1:17:21.345 --> 1:17:23.180
Come on.

1:17:28.644 --> 1:17:30.229
Eddie.

1:17:30.229 --> 1:17:32.314
Take this.

1:17:37.111 --> 1:17:38.988
Fuck.

1:17:45.077 --> 1:17:47.079
Thank you.

1:17:55.754 --> 1:17:58.632
Goddamn bear.

1:17:58.632 --> 1:18:00.217
Eddie, put the rest in the bag.

1:18:09.685 --> 1:18:11.520
You got what you wanted?

1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:12.855
Let's go.

1:18:16.025 --> 1:18:19.236
There's-there's a lot more
out there.

1:18:19.236 --> 1:18:22.197
We got to keep looking, understand?

1:18:24.533 --> 1:18:26.201
We're not whole yet.

1:18:26.201 --> 1:18:28.162
I'm leaving, Syd.

1:18:32.249 --> 1:18:33.709
Go.

1:18:58.233 --> 1:19:00.235
Give me the bag.

1:19:01.695 --> 1:19:04.031
When did you all get so soft?

1:19:04.031 --> 1:19:07.159
All got sand in your pussies.

1:19:09.954 --> 1:19:12.665
Mom! How are we gonna
get out of here?

1:19:12.665 --> 1:19:14.708
It's a dead end. What do we do?

1:19:14.708 --> 1:19:16.418
Stay away from the bears.

1:19:19.546 --> 1:19:21.757
This way.

1:19:21.757 --> 1:19:23.509
Come on. There's an opening.

1:19:23.509 --> 1:19:25.594
Henry, come here.

1:19:25.594 --> 1:19:28.055
Dee Dee, get in here.
Someone's coming.

1:19:29.723 --> 1:19:31.809
He has a gun.

1:19:36.563 --> 1:19:38.023
No!

1:19:38.023 --> 1:19:39.483
Come on!

1:19:40.442 --> 1:19:42.069
The hell is this?

1:19:42.069 --> 1:19:44.571
Whoa. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1:19:44.571 --> 1:19:46.490
- Dad.
- Who are you?

1:19:46.490 --> 1:19:48.117
I'm a mom.

1:19:48.117 --> 1:19:51.120
Syd, there's kids here.
Let's just go.

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:53.372
No, I'm not leaving
without that cocaine!

1:19:53.372 --> 1:19:56.792
So somebody better bring it down
or somebody else is gonna die.

1:19:56.792 --> 1:19:58.335
You understand?

1:20:00.796 --> 1:20:02.172
Go.

1:20:02.172 --> 1:20:04.133
Come on. Help him out!
- Yeah, yeah.

1:20:07.803 --> 1:20:10.264
It's stuck.

1:20:10.264 --> 1:20:11.390
Fuck!

1:20:12.474 --> 1:20:14.309
Who are these guys?

1:20:16.228 --> 1:20:17.688
We're going home.

1:20:17.688 --> 1:20:19.857
W-We're not gonna say anything,
but we're going home.

1:20:19.857 --> 1:20:21.400
Nobody's going anywhere!

1:20:22.943 --> 1:20:24.862
- Dad.
- Shut up, Eddie.

1:20:24.862 --> 1:20:26.655
- Dad!
- Shut...

1:20:28.032 --> 1:20:30.325
Get away. Back off. Back off.

1:20:30.325 --> 1:20:31.994
Get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1:20:31.994 --> 1:20:34.329
- Fuck.

1:20:34.329 --> 1:20:36.165
Get back! Get... Fuckers!

1:20:36.165 --> 1:20:37.541
- Stay away.

1:20:37.541 --> 1:20:38.625
- Whoa.
Stay away.

1:20:38.625 --> 1:20:39.752
Whoa. He hit the bear.

1:20:39.752 --> 1:20:41.086
Just give 'em the bag.

1:20:41.086 --> 1:20:42.963
Shoot the fucking bears!

1:20:42.963 --> 1:20:44.298
- Get over here.
- DEE DEE and HENRY: Whoa!

1:20:44.298 --> 1:20:46.008
Hey, can't get a shot.
They're too close to me!

1:20:46.008 --> 1:20:48.010
Give them the fucking coke.
They're little cubs.

1:20:48.010 --> 1:20:49.970
The fuck's the matter with you?

1:20:51.346 --> 1:20:53.849
Shoot the little
fucking cubs, Eddie!

1:20:53.849 --> 1:20:55.267
Get 'em off me!

1:20:55.267 --> 1:20:56.727
- Fuck him.
Help me out!

1:20:56.727 --> 1:20:58.312
Ow. Eddie!

1:20:58.312 --> 1:21:00.022
- Ow!
- No.

1:21:00.856 --> 1:21:02.232
Coward. Daveed!

1:21:03.192 --> 1:21:04.568
Here, catch.

1:21:07.029 --> 1:21:10.866
I am taking
the fucking children home.

1:21:11.742 --> 1:21:12.951
Mama!

1:21:12.951 --> 1:21:15.913
Hell yeah, Mrs. McKinndry.

1:21:15.913 --> 1:21:17.122
Look around, Dad.

1:21:17.122 --> 1:21:19.166
Kids have been dragged
into this.

1:21:19.166 --> 1:21:21.543
Get-get out of here,
you little fuckers!

1:21:21.543 --> 1:21:23.378
People are dead.

1:21:23.378 --> 1:21:25.464
You are no son of mine.

1:21:25.464 --> 1:21:26.715
Hey, you!

1:21:26.715 --> 1:21:28.217
You did this.

1:21:28.217 --> 1:21:29.718
You're the reason
this is all happening.

1:21:29.718 --> 1:21:32.054
And it's a good thing
he's not like you,

1:21:32.054 --> 1:21:34.264
because you're
a piece of crap person

1:21:34.264 --> 1:21:36.391
and a bad dad!

1:21:36.391 --> 1:21:37.726
Who the fuck are you?

1:21:37.726 --> 1:21:39.895
I'm Henry,

1:21:39.895 --> 1:21:42.564
and I am so fucking tired!

1:21:42.564 --> 1:21:43.732
Yeah, me, too.

1:22:10.968 --> 1:22:12.761
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:22:12.761 --> 1:22:14.763
She's protecting the cubs.

1:22:14.763 --> 1:22:15.848
Oh, shit!

1:22:15.848 --> 1:22:17.307
- We need to jump.
- Wait, what?

1:22:17.307 --> 1:22:18.642
- What? I'll be fine!
It's gonna be okay.

1:22:18.642 --> 1:22:19.935
We're gonna be okay.

1:22:19.935 --> 1:22:21.145
Here, here, here.

1:22:21.145 --> 1:22:22.563
Have some coke,
you little shits.

1:22:22.563 --> 1:22:24.148
- Get out of here!
- It's not that far, you guys.

1:22:24.148 --> 1:22:26.984
- We're gonna be all right.

1:22:26.984 --> 1:22:28.652
- Ready?
Mm-hmm.

1:22:28.652 --> 1:22:31.905
Three, two, one. Jump!

1:22:36.618 --> 1:22:38.453
- Oh, shit.

1:22:48.881 --> 1:22:50.799
Oh, shit. We got to jump.

1:22:53.677 --> 1:22:55.596
Let's go!

1:23:26.460 --> 1:23:29.171
- Come on. It's okay.

1:23:30.464 --> 1:23:33.008
Eddie. Help.
We made it.

1:24:21.890 --> 1:24:26.061
Get the shit out of here,
you fuck!

1:25:03.056 --> 1:25:05.475
- Oh, shit. He shot you.

1:25:05.475 --> 1:25:08.270
Help! Help!

1:25:13.608 --> 1:25:15.444
S-Six more days of John.

1:25:15.444 --> 1:25:17.112
Okay.

1:25:17.112 --> 1:25:18.989
Six more days...

1:25:18.989 --> 1:25:21.366
I need you to know,
what I said earlier...

1:25:21.366 --> 1:25:23.535
You're more than a drug dealer,
all right?

1:25:23.535 --> 1:25:25.370
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.

1:25:25.370 --> 1:25:27.748
- All right?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1:25:28.915 --> 1:25:31.335
Hey, hey, I...

1:25:31.335 --> 1:25:33.503
I got my last question.

1:25:33.503 --> 1:25:34.796
What?

1:25:34.796 --> 1:25:36.298
It's 20 questions.

1:25:36.298 --> 1:25:38.133
I got my last one.

1:25:38.133 --> 1:25:40.844
What? All right. Sure.

1:25:43.055 --> 1:25:45.265
Is it Joanie?

1:25:45.265 --> 1:25:46.808
It's Joanie, right?

1:25:46.808 --> 1:25:48.477
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:25:49.227 --> 1:25:51.271
How'd you guess?

1:25:51.271 --> 1:25:53.982
You're so fucking obvious.

1:25:53.982 --> 1:25:55.942
I just didn't want to guess it

1:25:55.942 --> 1:25:57.819
to have you crying on me
all day.

1:26:07.496 --> 1:26:09.623
She's a nurse!

1:26:09.623 --> 1:26:11.333
He-he got grazed by a bullet.

1:26:11.333 --> 1:26:12.667
He's in shock.

1:26:12.667 --> 1:26:14.378
Put pressure on him.

1:27:12.394 --> 1:27:14.688
I've called backup.

1:27:14.688 --> 1:27:17.232
Her name's Rosette.
She doesn't like fetch.

1:27:18.024 --> 1:27:20.193
You should get going.

1:27:20.193 --> 1:27:22.404
Take care of yourself.

1:27:27.451 --> 1:27:30.704
Hi. Hi.

1:27:31.997 --> 1:27:33.748
Rosette.

1:27:45.010 --> 1:27:46.428
Whose dog is this?

1:27:46.428 --> 1:27:48.013
I think it's mine.

1:27:48.013 --> 1:27:49.764
Mine and Gabe's.

1:27:49.764 --> 1:27:51.099
Is it on cocaine?

1:27:51.099 --> 1:27:53.018
No.

1:27:54.436 --> 1:27:56.605
That's a good dog.

1:27:58.773 --> 1:28:00.984
So we just grab Gabe
and go, right?

1:28:00.984 --> 1:28:02.486
Yeah.

1:28:06.198 --> 1:28:07.866
I knew you'd be okay.

1:28:07.866 --> 1:28:10.285
You're the toughest person
I know.

1:28:10.285 --> 1:28:13.246
I think you get that
from your mom.

1:28:13.246 --> 1:28:14.623
I think you're right.

1:28:14.623 --> 1:28:16.791
Thanks for coming to get me.

1:28:16.791 --> 1:28:19.044
I'm your mom. I love you.

1:28:19.044 --> 1:28:21.713
You, too, Henry.

1:28:21.713 --> 1:28:24.216
Hey, I'm sorry I pushed Ray
on you too soon.

1:28:24.216 --> 1:28:26.968
No. You deserve to be happy.

1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:29.846
Henry, let's walk over here.

1:28:29.846 --> 1:28:32.224
- Stay away from that. Come on.
I want to look.

1:28:32.224 --> 1:28:33.642
I also don't want to look.

1:28:33.642 --> 1:28:35.352
Ugh.
Don't look.

1:28:35.352 --> 1:28:37.646
- Let's just cruise on by.

1:28:37.646 --> 1:28:40.232
Oh, here come the po-po.

1:28:40.232 --> 1:28:41.608
Hey, Mom.

1:28:41.608 --> 1:28:43.860
I want to go to Nashville
with you and Ray.

1:28:43.860 --> 1:28:46.947
Maybe we can go after
me and Henry get out of rehab.

1:28:46.947 --> 1:28:48.323
Rehab?

1:28:48.323 --> 1:28:50.033
We're cokeheads now.

1:28:50.033 --> 1:28:51.493
You know?

1:28:51.493 --> 1:28:53.036
We got the bite,
and we're about that life,

1:28:53.036 --> 1:28:54.454
- Mrs. McKinndry.
Mm-hmm.

1:28:54.454 --> 1:28:56.790
Yeah, you're
too grounded for rehab.

1:29:12.514 --> 1:29:14.015
Rodney, are you getting it?

1:29:14.015 --> 1:29:16.059
I swear to God, Carol.

1:29:16.059 --> 1:29:17.644
Well, then zoom in.

1:29:17.644 --> 1:29:19.854
- Is the red light on?
- No, I got it.

1:29:21.064 --> 1:29:22.566
Oh, they're so cute.

1:29:22.566 --> 1:29:24.150
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1:29:24.150 --> 1:29:25.360
Wait.

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:27.028
Why are they looking
at us like that?

1:29:27.028 --> 1:29:28.780
Oh.

1:29:28.780 --> 1:29:30.323
Oh, shit.
