WEBVTT

00:04.070 --> 00:05.905
Man, I can't believe
Mr. Sumack assigned us

00:05.971 --> 00:06.906
a science project.

00:06.973 --> 00:08.675
Who does he think he is?

00:08.742 --> 00:10.043
{\an8}Our science teacher.

00:11.444 --> 00:12.412
{\an8}Whatever.

00:12.479 --> 00:13.546
At least
he paired us up together.

00:13.613 --> 00:14.781
That's good.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.282
Uh-huh.

00:17.584 --> 00:20.053
{\an8}You're bummed that Sumack
put us together.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.921
Well, every time
we get paired up

00:21.988 --> 00:23.256
on a school project,

00:23.323 --> 00:24.791
I always end up
doing all the work.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.226
Don't worry about that.

00:26.292 --> 00:28.228
-You'll help me this time?
-Of course not.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.098
{\an8}-Hey.
-Hi.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.600
{\an8}Aw, look who's all grumpy

00:33.666 --> 00:35.935
'cause he didn't get
paired up with Carly

00:36.002 --> 00:38.171
for his little science project.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.407
-Untrue.
-True.

00:40.473 --> 00:41.641
So?

00:43.176 --> 00:44.544
Besides, I'm way more grumpy

00:44.611 --> 00:46.546
'cause of who I did
get paired up with.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.214
{\an8}How am I supposed to do
a science project

00:48.281 --> 00:49.916
{\an8}with a psycho wrestler
who's always--

00:49.983 --> 00:53.820
Hey, whassup fray-do?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.155
Duke.

00:55.221 --> 00:58.458
Duke, this is only fun
for one of us.

00:58.525 --> 00:59.893
Duke. Duke.

00:59.959 --> 01:02.028
Beef jerky.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.397
It's yours
if you let Freddie go.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.234
How did I end up
in a hostage negotiation?

01:13.706 --> 01:14.641
Thanks.

01:14.707 --> 01:16.109
It was my jerky.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.244
You owe me three bucks.

01:18.311 --> 01:19.779
Wow, I've never
seen dried beef

01:19.846 --> 01:21.781
make a boy so happy.

01:21.848 --> 01:23.716
Hey.

01:23.783 --> 01:25.919
So what's our science project
gonna be on?

01:25.985 --> 01:27.353
Well, I was thinking

01:27.420 --> 01:29.522
maybe we could do a study
on the efficiency of--

01:29.589 --> 01:31.057
Hey.

01:31.124 --> 01:33.359
Why don't we do a study
on why my knee pads

01:33.426 --> 01:34.627
stink so bad?

01:41.134 --> 01:43.036
Why'd you shove
your knee pad in my face?

01:43.102 --> 01:44.604
'Cause it reeks.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.105
Great explanation.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.980
You owe Sam three bucks
for the jerky.

01:54.047 --> 01:54.981
No, he doesn't.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.049
But you said--

01:56.115 --> 01:57.417
I took his wallet.

01:58.885 --> 02:02.422

Okay, here.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.091
We could do an experiment
that shows

03:12.158 --> 03:13.393
how different temperatures

03:13.459 --> 03:14.827
can affect photosynthesis
in plants.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.362
Interesting.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.464
Now, based on that,

03:18.531 --> 03:20.466
what if we just blow up stuff
in the microwave?

03:22.168 --> 03:24.270
Hey, what you ladies up to?

03:24.337 --> 03:25.872
Lil' sitting?

03:25.939 --> 03:27.273
Lil' conversing?

03:27.340 --> 03:28.408
We're just trying
to pick a topic

03:28.474 --> 03:29.642
for our science project.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.543
Ah.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.045
I believe it was Einstein

03:32.111 --> 03:34.547
who said, "what can't be proven
"scientifically"

03:34.614 --> 03:38.217
is the scientific nature
of science itself."

03:38.284 --> 03:39.452
Einstein said that?

03:39.519 --> 03:41.554
Either him or that hobo

03:41.621 --> 03:43.556
that sleeps in the garbage
behind our building.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.659
I love hobos.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.294
Let's do our project on hobos.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.129
What do hobos have to do
with science?

03:50.196 --> 03:52.098
Aren't they affected
by gravity or something?

03:53.433 --> 03:54.667
You know, when I was in school,

03:54.734 --> 03:55.835
we hatched a bunch
of baby chicks

03:55.902 --> 03:57.070
in the classroom.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.072
Very cool, very fun.

03:59.138 --> 04:00.273
That's perfect.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.274
Can Sam and I do that here?

04:01.341 --> 04:02.709
Sure.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.010
Oh, and we can even show it
on iCarly...

04:04.077 --> 04:05.511
The eggs,
the whole incubation process,

04:05.578 --> 04:06.746
and then
the baby chicks being born.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.514
And then we make fried chicken.

04:10.516 --> 04:12.452
Give me your hand.

04:12.518 --> 04:13.753
Owww.

04:16.456 --> 04:17.890
Wait, come bite the other one.

04:21.594 --> 04:25.365
In five, four, three, two.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.467
Hey, it's time for iCarly.

04:27.533 --> 04:28.735
On the beach.

04:30.370 --> 04:31.771
She's the fantabulous Carly.

04:31.838 --> 04:34.073
And she's Sam,
my poorly behaved best friend.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.177
Look at us on the beach.

04:38.244 --> 04:41.080
-Woo.
-Woo.

04:41.147 --> 04:43.316
-Ah.
-Ah.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.717
Carly, we're in outer space.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.519
But it's dangerous
to be in outer space

04:46.586 --> 04:49.222
wearing only swimsuits.

04:49.288 --> 04:50.390
Freddie, help.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.091
Turn off the green screen.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.596
Okay, those special effects
were done

04:56.663 --> 04:58.064
by our awesome
technical producer,

04:58.131 --> 05:00.299
the always reliable
and rarely sticky,

05:00.366 --> 05:01.801
Freddie Benson.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.237
It's true.

05:04.303 --> 05:05.905
I haven't been sticky in weeks.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.908
Hey look, I'm in your shot.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.710
Turn the camera
back on the stars, would you?

05:12.712 --> 05:14.113
So, what ever will happen

05:14.180 --> 05:15.948
on this new and
exciting webisode of iCarly?

05:16.015 --> 05:17.850
-I'm glad you asked.
-I'm glad you're glad.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.252
Are you glad
I'm glad you're glad?

05:19.318 --> 05:20.720
Weird, I'm getting less glad.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.057
We're gonna show you a video
sent in by one of our viewers.

05:24.123 --> 05:25.858
We don't really get the point
of what this guy did.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.627
But it fits into the theme
of our show tonight.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.262
Freddie, roll the clip.

05:29.328 --> 05:30.863
Clip being rolled.

05:32.398 --> 05:33.733
Hey Carly and Sam.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.169
I am a huge fan of iCarly,

05:36.235 --> 05:37.704
and to prove it to you guys,

05:37.770 --> 05:39.439
I'm gonna sit in my bathtub

05:39.505 --> 05:42.041
that I filled
with scrambled eggs.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.242
Here goes.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.281
Yes. Yes.

05:52.218 --> 05:53.219
Later.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.724
Not the best video
we've ever gotten.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.126
So why'd we show it to you?

06:00.193 --> 06:02.662
'Cause tonight on iCarly,
the special theme is--

06:02.729 --> 06:04.330
-Eggs.
-Eggs.

06:04.397 --> 06:05.364
But not eggs for eating.

06:05.431 --> 06:06.532
Or bathtub sitting.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.301
We're talking...

06:08.367 --> 06:09.669
These babies.

06:11.604 --> 06:12.739
Our science teacher
is making us do

06:12.805 --> 06:14.207
a project together.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.676
Thanks, Mr. Sumack.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.244
So, we got some
fertilized chicken eggs.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.246
Put 'em in this special box
called an Incubator--

06:20.313 --> 06:23.149
Which keeps the eggs
at exactly 99.5 degrees.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.784
Then all we gotta do
is turn the eggs a few times

06:24.851 --> 06:26.319
every day, and soon--

06:26.385 --> 06:28.321
We gonna have us
some baby chicks.

06:28.387 --> 06:29.889
Wahoo.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.726
And you guys can come back
to iCarly.Com

06:33.793 --> 06:34.961
any time you want.

06:35.027 --> 06:36.596
And click
on the egg-cam button--

06:36.662 --> 06:38.765
To watch our little egglings
until they're actually born.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.533
-That one's Shelly.
-His name is Huevo.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.801
-That's Omelet.
-He is Benedict.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.136
-She's Yoko.
-And that's Poachy.

06:43.202 --> 06:44.704
Okay, family photo.

06:52.278 --> 06:53.646
I want breakfast.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.414
-We got cereal.
-Milk?

06:55.481 --> 06:57.116
Out of milk.

06:57.183 --> 06:58.251
I'll use root beer.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.357
Uh, you guys?

07:06.425 --> 07:10.129
Any reason I just found this
in my shower?

07:10.196 --> 07:11.330
Oh my gosh.

07:11.397 --> 07:12.932
A chick.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.534
Yeah, I picked him up
thinking he was a bar of soap.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.069
Good thing I realized before...

07:17.136 --> 07:18.171
Never mind.

07:19.539 --> 07:20.606
But how could there be a--

07:20.673 --> 07:22.408
Our chicks haven't hatched yet.

07:22.475 --> 07:23.509
Or--

07:23.576 --> 07:24.811
We're mothers.

07:31.517 --> 07:32.819
They all hatched.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.120
Okay,
then where are the baby chicks?

07:34.187 --> 07:35.721
Well, we know one
just took a shower

07:35.788 --> 07:37.023
with your brother.

07:38.891 --> 07:40.760
This isn't funny.
How'd they get out?

07:40.827 --> 07:42.195
I was watching the egg-cam.

07:42.261 --> 07:43.830
I can't believe
they already hatched.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.999
Oh, man, did Sam eat them?

07:48.568 --> 07:52.138
I wouldn't eat baby chicks raw.

07:53.439 --> 07:55.041
-They escaped.
-What?

07:55.107 --> 07:56.776
Spencer found one
in the bathroom downstairs

07:56.843 --> 07:57.777
so the other ones
could be anywhere

07:57.844 --> 07:59.011
in this whole apartment.

07:59.078 --> 08:00.413
Wait.

08:00.479 --> 08:01.814
I thought newborn chicks
have to stay in their Incubator.

08:01.881 --> 08:03.416
-They do.
-How long can they be out?

08:03.482 --> 08:04.750
I don't know.

08:04.817 --> 08:05.685
Uh, let's go online
and find out.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.186
Hurry.

08:08.754 --> 08:12.558
Okay, okay.
Ah, I'll search chicks.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.360
There.
WorldOfChicks.com.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.462
Click on that.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.064
Chuck Jones, Chuck Barry,

08:18.130 --> 08:19.565
Chuck Yeager, Chuck Norris.

08:19.632 --> 08:20.633
What is this?

08:20.700 --> 08:21.701
You typed it wrong.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.169
That's "World of Chucks."

08:25.004 --> 08:26.839
-Oh.
-Let me do it.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.576
There. Chickapedia.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.010
Okay.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.712
During the first week of life,

08:33.779 --> 08:35.847
newborn chicks must be kept
at a temperature of 90 degrees,

08:35.914 --> 08:37.884
and they must be fed
every four hours.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.318
Or else, what?

08:40.385 --> 08:41.554
Bad things.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.054
Meaning?

08:43.121 --> 08:45.157
Six cute
little chicken funerals.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.496
Well, according
to the egg-cam,

08:50.563 --> 08:53.799
they got out 56 minutes ago.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.268
And Spencer has one,

08:55.334 --> 08:57.036
so that leaves five chicks
still missing.

08:57.103 --> 09:00.106
That gives us three hours
and four minutes to find them.

09:00.172 --> 09:01.841
Okay. We can do this, right?

09:01.908 --> 09:03.075
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

09:03.142 --> 09:04.744
-Good.
-Can we have lunch first?

09:04.810 --> 09:06.279
-No.
-Okay.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.326
Okay,
there's a total of six chicks.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.928
Right.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.095
We already have the one
Spencer found in the shower.

09:23.162 --> 09:24.964
-Shelly.
-Checking off Shelly.

09:25.031 --> 09:26.599
Which means there's still
five baby chicks

09:26.666 --> 09:27.867
somewhere in this apartment.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.702
We gotta find Huevo,
Omelet, Benedict,

09:29.769 --> 09:32.071
Yoko, and Poachy.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.839
How much longer can they go
without eating?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.408
Two hours, 55 minutes.

09:35.474 --> 09:37.410
Hey, Duke's on his way over.

09:37.476 --> 09:38.544
We don't want Duke here.

09:38.611 --> 09:39.912
We're in the middle of a crisis.

09:39.979 --> 09:41.280
This is no time
for sweaty wrestlers.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.482
He was already on his way
over to my place.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.818
We were supposed to work
on our science project today.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.087
Okay, fine.
If he helps us look.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.456
Hey, didn't chickapedia say
that newborn chicks

09:50.523 --> 09:51.724
had to be kept at 90 degrees?

09:51.791 --> 09:53.092
What's the temperature in here?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.128
Seventy-two.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.430
Turn the heat up to 90.

09:57.496 --> 09:58.731
Ninety degrees?

09:58.798 --> 10:00.266
No, 90 pickles...

10:00.333 --> 10:01.467
Yes, 90 degrees.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.437
No need to be hurtful.

10:06.205 --> 10:07.506
Freddie,
you take the third floor.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.175
You check both our bedrooms.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.010
Sam, you search in this room
and I'll check the kitchen.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.979
Everyone grab a walkie-talkie
and find a small chicken.

10:13.045 --> 10:14.447
-Got it.
-Let's do this.

10:29.862 --> 10:32.231
Hey, hey, Sam,
I think I found one.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.799
-You got one?
-Where is it?

10:33.866 --> 10:35.101
I heard a peep
coming from the sink.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.435
Maybe he fell down the drain.

10:36.502 --> 10:37.570
Okay, shhh. Shhh.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.073
I hear him.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.441
How can we get him out?

10:44.210 --> 10:46.012
-You see anything?
-No, it's too dark.

10:46.078 --> 10:47.980
-I'll turn on the light.
-Wait, no, don't.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.417
That's the garbage disposal.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.918
Oh my god.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.320
-Turn it off.
-Turn it off.

11:00.192 --> 11:02.294
Okay, that was close.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.530
Yeah, you almost made
a baby chicken smoothie.

11:09.301 --> 11:10.870
Okay, he's stuck in
the pipe down here.

11:10.936 --> 11:13.172
-I'll get a wrench.
-Good hurry!

11:13.239 --> 11:14.306
Here, let me under there.

11:14.373 --> 11:15.508
No, you go find the other four.

11:15.574 --> 11:16.475
Sam and I got this one.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.144
Okay.

11:20.446 --> 11:23.015
Here chickie, chickie,
chickie, chickie.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.917
Here chickie,
chickie, chickie, chickie.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.852
Here chickie, chickie.

11:26.919 --> 11:28.320
Here chickie,
chickie.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.388
Ha, got one.

11:33.392 --> 11:36.162
I knew Sam hid
my corn dog last month.

11:39.298 --> 11:40.966
Okay, I got the pipe unscrewed.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.268
Can you pull the chick out?

11:42.334 --> 11:43.469
No, my hand won't fit
in the pipe.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.570
Here, move.

11:45.871 --> 11:46.906
-Cup your hands.
-Why?

11:46.972 --> 11:48.674
Just do it.

11:48.741 --> 11:50.376
Okay, little guy.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.578
Here's where two miserable years
of trombone lessons pays off.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.183
Gotcha.

11:59.418 --> 12:00.519
He okay?

12:00.586 --> 12:02.088
He's perfect.

12:02.154 --> 12:03.289
Four to go.
Keep looking upstairs.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.490
On it.

12:08.928 --> 12:09.962
You got one?

12:10.029 --> 12:11.330
Yep, cross out Huevo.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.364
Huevo's bueno.

12:12.431 --> 12:13.566
Four to go.

12:13.632 --> 12:15.267
Yep.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.803
Oh, don't stop looking.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.071
I won't stop looking.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.842
Hi, Duke.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.176
You find the chicks?

12:24.243 --> 12:25.678
Just two.
There're still four missing.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.246
Hey, hey, shhh, shhh.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.082
I think I hear one
in this heating duct.

12:30.149 --> 12:31.383
Help me move this thing.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.824
Listen.

12:38.891 --> 12:39.859
I hear peeping.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.060
Yeah, he's definitely in there.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.528
I'll crawl in and get him.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.696
No way, little sister.

12:43.762 --> 12:44.730
Too dangerous.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.398
I got this one.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.703
Don't worry little chicken.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.338
Uncle Spencer's a coming.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.744
Hey. I see him.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.247
If I can just get my arms up,
I should...

13:06.519 --> 13:07.486
Hey guys?

13:07.553 --> 13:09.155
-What?
-Yeah.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.090
Uncle Spencer is stuck.

13:13.692 --> 13:15.628
Uncle Spencer is stuck.

13:16.762 --> 13:17.863
No, chickie.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.632
Wait, come back.

13:19.698 --> 13:20.733
I'm here to help you.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.304
-What's happening?
-Got another chick?

13:25.371 --> 13:26.705
Spencer found one
in the heating duct.

13:26.772 --> 13:28.340
I arrived moments ago.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.576
Good to know.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.646
Will you guys
pull me outta here?

13:33.712 --> 13:34.780
Grab him and pull.

13:34.847 --> 13:35.848
On three.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.017
One, two, three.

13:40.786 --> 13:41.987
Pull harder.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.828
Did my pants come off?

13:49.895 --> 13:51.997
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

13:52.064 --> 13:54.099
Please tell me
I'm wearing underwear.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.601
You're good.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.269
Awesome.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.004
Um, one more question.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.172
Yeah?

14:00.239 --> 14:01.507
How am I gonna
get outta here?.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.875
Relax.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.310
The heat's on high
which will eventually cause

14:04.376 --> 14:05.744
the metal to expand.

14:05.811 --> 14:07.413
And you'll get all sweaty.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.615
All right, you guys go find
the other chicks.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.683
-Right.
-Yep.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.554
No, roly poly.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.556
Roly poly.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.802
Hey, I think I hear one
behind the fridge.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.672
Yeah, there's definitely one
back there.

14:33.739 --> 14:34.907
Back up.

14:34.974 --> 14:36.041
I'll move the fridge.

14:36.108 --> 14:37.643
Dude, that thing weighs a ton.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.944
Move.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.312
I love animals.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.722
-Yell at me.
-Huh?

14:49.788 --> 14:51.457
I always do better
when coach yells at me,

14:51.523 --> 14:52.558
so do it.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.228
Um.

14:56.295 --> 14:57.296
Come on, Duke.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.031
Lift the fridge. Good boy.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.599
Come on, Duke. Lift the fridge.

15:00.666 --> 15:01.700
Yeah, good boy.

15:03.302 --> 15:04.503
I'm not a dog.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.072
Well, what am I supposed to--

15:07.139 --> 15:08.674
You gotta yell at me
like coach does

15:08.741 --> 15:11.443
if you want that baby chick
back there to make it.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.178
Okay, uh.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.481
Go, Lubberman. Go.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.783
You gotta want it.
You gotta want it.

15:17.850 --> 15:21.420
I want it--

15:30.663 --> 15:31.697
Got him.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.304
Omelet, found.

15:38.370 --> 15:39.571
I need a snack.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.145
Spencer, we got three of 'em.

15:46.211 --> 15:47.379
Three to go.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.381
Thank you for keeping me
in the loop.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.551

Good.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.892
I'm pretty sure
there's another one up

16:33.959 --> 16:34.893
on that beam there.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.462
-Up there?
-Yeah.

16:36.528 --> 16:37.730
Can we borrow a ladder

16:37.796 --> 16:39.264
We don't have time.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.540

16:48.607 --> 16:49.942
I think you had gum

Shut up, Sam.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.780
-Be careful.
-I'm good. I'm good.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.151
Hi baby.

I think there's a chick
inside the wall.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.323
Goochie goochie
goochie goochie.

17:42.060 --> 17:45.998
Okay, my uncle's a carpenter
so maybe he can bring over--

17:46.064 --> 17:47.900
Ahhh.

18:00.279 --> 18:01.680
What was that?

18:06.652 --> 18:08.821
We found baby chick number four.

18:08.887 --> 18:10.722
Okay, that's good.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.192
That means you only got
two chicks left, oh my god.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.060
Another roly poly.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.428
Roly poly.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.439
Just walk toward me
you nutty little chick.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.376
Try to grab him.

18:32.544 --> 18:34.680
Wow, if only
I'd thought of that.

18:35.814 --> 18:36.849
Come on.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.417
Come on, chickie.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.285
I think I almost got him.

18:40.352 --> 18:41.620
Be careful.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.823
Okay, he's almost in my-
Sam, catch him.

18:50.829 --> 18:52.097
I got him.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.099
Good. Just be careful
coming down from the--

18:54.166 --> 18:55.501
Ohh.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.375
That wasn't careful.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.919
Okay, you're killing me.

19:18.457 --> 19:19.825
This isn't working.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.860
Really?

19:21.927 --> 19:23.662
I wish we could
just think of a way

19:23.729 --> 19:25.564
to smoothly slide him
outta there.

19:25.631 --> 19:28.433
Oh, I want a smoothie.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.868
No, I didn't mean.

19:32.604 --> 19:35.007
Tell them to add
some intelligence boost.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.144
-We found Yoko.
-Chick number five.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.479
Okay, we've found Shelly,

19:40.546 --> 19:43.482
Huevo, Omelet,
Benedict, and Yoko.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.117
Now we just gotta find Poachy.

19:45.183 --> 19:48.587
How much time do we have left
before bad things happen?

19:48.654 --> 19:49.988
About nine minutes.

19:50.055 --> 19:51.390
Oh, nine minutes.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.724
Spencer, you doing okay?

19:52.791 --> 19:53.692
No.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.093
Well, just hang in there.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.395
Sure.

19:57.563 --> 19:58.764
Freddie,
you keep searching down here.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.032
Sam and I
will keep looking upstairs.

20:00.098 --> 20:01.133
Okay.

20:02.968 --> 20:07.606
-Come on, come on.
-Come on, come on.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.842
Eight minutes.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.077
What if we don't find
the little guy?

20:12.144 --> 20:13.845
Don't say that.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.380
But we're almost
outta time and--

20:15.447 --> 20:16.682
We found five,
we can find one more.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.551
Poor little Poachy.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.525
Ahhh.

20:26.592 --> 20:27.859
-No way.
-There he is.

20:27.926 --> 20:29.861
-Poachy.
-You crazy little chick.

20:32.431 --> 20:33.665
-Whew.
-We did it.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.467
With seven minutes to spare.

20:35.534 --> 20:36.768
Let's just get him outta there.

20:39.338 --> 20:40.572
I can't get the window off.

20:40.639 --> 20:42.541
The frame's screwed
into the wall.

20:42.608 --> 20:43.942
How are we gonna...

20:46.211 --> 20:47.412
Freddie.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.817
Freddie. Freddie, answer.

20:51.883 --> 20:53.051
What's up?

20:53.118 --> 20:54.386
We found the last chick
but we need tools

20:54.453 --> 20:55.821
to get through it.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.189
Okay, there's tools in a box
on my tech cart.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.256
On my way up.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.558
No no, don't take the elevator.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.493
What? But why, why, why?

21:03.028 --> 21:04.096
No, no, no.

21:04.162 --> 21:05.197
No. Come on, don't.

21:06.365 --> 21:08.266
Man, no.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.102
Freddie, Freddie, come on.

21:10.168 --> 21:11.303
No, no.

21:11.370 --> 21:12.604
Freddie.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.141
-Move.
-What's the matter?

21:16.208 --> 21:17.509
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

21:25.651 --> 21:26.852
What's going on?

21:28.086 --> 21:29.788
The last chick was
behind that window.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.391
Why'd you hit the stupid button?

21:32.457 --> 21:33.425
I was just trying to--

21:33.492 --> 21:35.594
It wasn't Freddie's fault.

21:35.661 --> 21:36.862
Okay, okay.

21:38.296 --> 21:39.464
Maybe if we look in the--

21:39.531 --> 21:41.633
He was in the elevator shaft.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.535
He could be anywhere
in this whole building by now.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.739
Anyway, it's too late.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.652
We saved five of them.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.821
We would've saved all six
if I hadn't hit that button.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.157
You didn't know.

22:05.223 --> 22:07.092
It wasn't...

22:07.159 --> 22:08.126
Spencer.

22:08.193 --> 22:09.561
Uh-oh, he's freaking out.

22:09.628 --> 22:10.896
Let's try to pull him
outta there again.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.434
One, two, three.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.768
I'm coming out.

22:18.270 --> 22:19.638
Come on, Spencer.

22:25.477 --> 22:26.545
Spencer, are you--

22:26.611 --> 22:28.580
-You okay?
-You all right?

22:35.320 --> 22:36.421
You coughed up Poachy.

22:36.488 --> 22:37.723
Poachy.

22:39.758 --> 22:40.959
You saved him.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.794
Yeah, yeah.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.030
I guess I did.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.311
He crawled into my mouth.

23:02.814 --> 23:04.983
{\an8}It didn't even taste
like chicken.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.495
Hey Carly, watch what I can do.

23:16.561 --> 23:18.330
And look-there's no string.

23:35.380 --> 23:36.948
Mmm.
