[ALL GRUNTING]

16:27.470 --> 16:30.178
You realize
you almost got him killed, right?

16:30.974 --> 16:33.250
- Sorry, I...
- Actually, he saved me.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.980
Or, at least, you all did.

16:35.145 --> 16:37.352
Neutron's overload accelerated.

16:37.514 --> 16:40.757
Even at my top speed, I'd have never
made it to the desert in time.

16:40.917 --> 16:44.421
But what are you doing?
You're retired. You could've died.

16:44.654 --> 16:47.828
Eh. Joan is gonna kill me
just for putting on the tin hat.

16:47.991 --> 16:49.265
KID FLASH:
Hey, where's the kid?

17:17.252 --> 17:18.857
- Is that…?
- Yeah.

17:19.021 --> 17:20.626
Might want to get him a blanket.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.862
- What's happening to me?
- We're not sure, son.

17:24.027 --> 17:25.869
But it looks like it's over.

17:26.029 --> 17:28.202
His heat signature reads
normal human now.

17:28.698 --> 17:30.644
- What did happen?
- No idea.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.747
Guess ol' Neutron just ran out of juice.

17:34.237 --> 17:36.046
Who's Neutron?

17:44.380 --> 17:45.723
[GIGGLING]

17:45.882 --> 17:48.285
Should I be concerned
over the obvious delight

17:48.311 --> 17:50.413
our daughter takes
in the ultra-violence?

17:50.553 --> 17:53.295
- It's genetic.
- Great.

17:53.456 --> 17:56.733
Well, this was the door they didn't want us
anywhere near, so...

18:20.917 --> 18:22.123
[GASPS]

[MOANS]

18:28.625 --> 18:30.070
Dadas.

NIGHTWING: Impulse's DNA matches up
with both Iris and you, Barry.

18:42.539 --> 18:46.715
And this thing is giving off
both Zeta and Chronotron radiation.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.482
Which is, based on pure theory...

18:49.646 --> 18:52.320
what you'd expect to find
radiating off a time machine.

18:52.482 --> 18:54.860
Which means you're exactly
who you say you are.

18:55.018 --> 18:57.794
Ha. Told you.
Anyway, it's been crash.

18:57.954 --> 19:02.403
But the future awaits.
I gotta run. Ha, ha!

19:02.592 --> 19:04.469
See what I did there?
With the "run?"

19:05.061 --> 19:08.372
- That was for you, Gramps.
- Bart, thanks for coming.

19:08.531 --> 19:14.641
I look forward to meeting you again for
the first time and watching you grow up.

19:14.804 --> 19:17.910
That will be crash.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.120
So long.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.699
Maybe he's traveling forward
one second at a time.

19:34.157 --> 19:37.297
It's not working. The whole thing's fried.

19:37.460 --> 19:39.940
- Can you fix it?
- I'm a tourist, not a chronal expert.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.702
Look at me.
I'm trapped in the stupid past.

19:43.066 --> 19:45.808
Ugh. I'm so moded.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.317
MAN: How's it coming?
BART: Almost finished.

19:56.479 --> 19:59.688
- Wish I could go along.
- Sorry. Only seats one.

19:59.849 --> 20:03.058
You understand the trip to the past
will fry the machine's circuitry.

20:03.219 --> 20:05.199
This is a one-way ticket.

20:05.355 --> 20:08.199
Does this look like
a future worth returning to?

20:16.366 --> 20:17.566
<i>[SIGHS]</i>

20:17.567 --> 20:20.070
Well, I'd better get in character, Neutron.

20:20.236 --> 20:22.648
Please don't use that name.

20:22.805 --> 20:27.379
I was Neutron for too many years,
through too much destruction.

20:27.543 --> 20:30.547
Curing me and saving Flash's life.

20:30.713 --> 20:33.216
You know, that's only the beginning.

20:33.383 --> 20:35.727
I know, Nathaniel. Big mission.

20:35.885 --> 20:38.593
Lots to do. Better get to it.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.638
That kid is so crash. He did it.

20:53.803 --> 20:55.942
It's a new... Day?

20:56.673 --> 20:59.483
No. Time stream.

20:59.642 --> 21:02.122
It should have all changed, all at once.

21:02.278 --> 21:04.451
The mode should have crashed.

21:04.614 --> 21:07.117
It should have all crashed.
