00:38.930 --> 00:41.462
This romance is
so full of heartfelt passion.

00:41.639 --> 00:45.423
I can really identify with
this corn-fed heroine.

00:45.643 --> 00:47.386
Homer, are you awake?

00:47.561 --> 00:49.933
This is important.
Give me some sign you're awake.

00:50.981 --> 00:53.389
- Wake up!
- What's wrong?

00:53.567 --> 00:55.726
House run away? Dog's on fire?

00:55.903 --> 00:59.486
Homie, do you think that the romance
has gone out of our lives?

01:00.407 --> 01:02.530
Wake up!

01:02.701 --> 01:05.322
Marge, it's 3 a.m.,
and I worked all day.

01:05.537 --> 01:08.280
It's 9:30 p.m., and you spent
your whole Saturday...

01:08.207 --> 01:10.449
...drinking beer
in Maggie's kiddie pool.

01:11.543 --> 01:13.666
There you are.

01:13.837 --> 01:15.296
Thought you could get away, huh?

01:15.506 --> 01:17.831
Homer, young people learn
about love from adults.

01:18.800 --> 01:22.255
We've been setting a terrible example
for our children and the community.

01:22.429 --> 01:26.379
I want us to deal with the issues
raised by this book.

01:29.436 --> 01:31.844
We shouldn't have put
a fireplace in the bedroom.

02:05.264 --> 02:08.383
How many times can you laugh
at that cat getting hit by the moon?

02:08.600 --> 02:09.929
It's a new episode.

02:10.102 --> 02:12.854
Not exactly. They pieced it
together from old shows.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.437
And it seems new to the trusting eyes
of impressionable youth.

02:16.650 --> 02:19.485
- Really?
- Ren & Stimpy do it all the time.

02:19.695 --> 02:23.230
Yes, and when was the last you heard
anyone talk about Ren & Stimpy?

02:23.407 --> 02:26.823
Children, your father and I
have fed you and clothed you...

02:26.994 --> 02:29.781
...but we've neglected
something more important.

02:29.997 --> 02:32.120
It's time to learn about love.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.206
No need. We already learned in school.

02:34.585 --> 02:36.376
This is Fuzzy Bunny.

02:36.587 --> 02:41.462
About a year ago he noticed his voice
was changing. He had terrible acne...

02:41.633 --> 02:47.588
...and had fur where there was no fur
before. He also noticed Fluffy Bunny.

02:47.806 --> 02:49.598
Boring.

02:49.808 --> 02:53.853
Fuzzy went to the park,
the ice-cream social, the boat show...

02:54.210 --> 02:58.350
...and other wholesome activities.
They never ruined their fun...

02:58.525 --> 03:01.894
...by giving in to their throbbing
biological urges.

03:02.710 --> 03:04.280
Then came the big day.

03:04.198 --> 03:09.109
Fluffy and Fuzzy got married.
That night came the honeymoon.

03:10.996 --> 03:12.372
She's faking it.

03:12.581 --> 03:15.831
I mean romance, not love.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.288
Mom, romance is dead.

03:17.503 --> 03:20.504
It was acquired in a hostile takeover
by Hallmark and Disney...

03:20.714 --> 03:23.419
...homogenized and sold off
piece by piece.

03:23.634 --> 03:28.110
That's not true! Romance is
all around us, in our neighborhoods.

03:29.306 --> 03:31.465
Even at our jobs.

03:41.193 --> 03:45.570
All you have to do is think about
your most cherished memories.

03:46.824 --> 03:49.660
- Moe's Tavern.
- Hello, is Al there?

03:49.243 --> 03:51.994
- AI?
- Yeah, Al. Last name, Coholic.

03:52.204 --> 03:53.579
Let me check.

03:53.789 --> 03:56.410
Phone call for Al.
Al Coholic.

03:56.625 --> 03:58.701
Jock Strap.

03:58.919 --> 04:00.710
Is I.P. Freely here?

04:00.921 --> 04:04.504
Hey, is there a Butts here?
Seymour Butts?

04:05.300 --> 04:07.792
Homer Sexual!
Mike Rotch!

04:08.120 --> 04:09.636
Amanda Huggenkiss!

04:09.847 --> 04:12.890
Hugh Jass.
Ivana Tinkle.

04:12.308 --> 04:15.593
I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face
and a big butt...

04:15.811 --> 04:19.595
...and my butt smells
and I like to kiss my own butt.

04:19.815 --> 04:21.190
No, no!

04:21.358 --> 04:25.570
No, ask your heart
what its fondest desire is.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.446
Chocolate.

04:31.327 --> 04:33.449
Invisible cola.

04:34.246 --> 04:36.535
Forbidden donut.

04:37.791 --> 04:39.701
"Sacrilicious."

04:41.211 --> 04:42.374
Snouts.

04:43.470 --> 04:44.375
Free goo.

04:45.549 --> 04:47.800
Something.

04:47.259 --> 04:49.252
No, think about people...

04:49.428 --> 04:53.342
...about moments in your life
that have been very romantic.

04:53.557 --> 04:54.588
Oh, okay.

04:57.853 --> 05:01.637
That's not the idea at all.

05:02.399 --> 05:08.105
Okay. Well, this story isn't ideal.
I've never told it to you before.

05:08.447 --> 05:12.860
I got a thoughtless birthday present from
someone who shall remain nameless.

05:16.497 --> 05:18.822
I went to the bowling alley
to spite him. Or her.

05:31.178 --> 05:34.713
- I'm awfully sorry.
- Entirely my fault.

05:34.932 --> 05:36.556
It is nice to meet you...

05:37.851 --> 05:39.346
...Homer.

05:39.520 --> 05:44.514
No, no. Homer is my
ball's name. I'm Marge.

05:49.710 --> 05:54.112
Your fingers are slender, so feminine.
They're too tapered for this ball.

05:54.284 --> 05:57.653
You need something lighter,
more delicate.

05:57.871 --> 06:02.747
- Here, use my ball.
- No, thank you, Mister... Brunswick.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.202
- Call me Jacques.
- Jacques.

06:05.421 --> 06:06.796
Marge.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.998
May I ask you a bold question?

06:10.175 --> 06:11.967
- Sure.
- You've never bowled?

06:12.136 --> 06:13.464
- Never.
- No.

06:13.679 --> 06:15.968
- No.
- Then I will teach you.

06:16.140 --> 06:19.343
- I don't want to trouble you.
- Not at all. I'm a professional.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.766
Roll the ball, Marge.
Let me see your form.

06:21.937 --> 06:24.938
All right.
But I'm not very good.

06:27.901 --> 06:31.401
I can hit the one pin, but
the rest of them don't even wobble.

06:31.572 --> 06:33.730
I can help you, Marge.
Pick up the ball.

06:33.949 --> 06:36.238
Pick up Homer. Pick him up.

06:38.412 --> 06:39.906
- Now throw.
- But...

06:40.800 --> 06:42.156
Throw, damn you.

06:46.628 --> 06:49.360
You're a very good teacher.

06:50.466 --> 06:53.870
- Here we are.
- You didn't have to drop me off.

06:53.260 --> 06:54.671
But I wanted to.

06:54.845 --> 06:58.925
Marge, do you know how beautiful
you look in the moonlight?

06:59.990 --> 07:02.551
- Jacques, I'm a married woman.
- I know, I know.

07:02.728 --> 07:08.102
My mind says stop, but my heart
and my hips cry, "Proceed!"

07:09.401 --> 07:11.608
Darling, I want to see you tomorrow.

07:11.779 --> 07:14.200
- Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
- What's brunch?

07:14.239 --> 07:16.730
You'd love it. It's not quite
breakfast or lunch...

07:16.909 --> 07:19.945
...but it comes with a slice of
cantaloupe at the end.

07:20.162 --> 07:23.863
You don't get what you would at
breakfast, but you get a good meal.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.283
He seemed to know a lot
about brunch.

07:26.460 --> 07:29.496
But it turned out he wasn't
interested in brunch at all.

07:30.965 --> 07:35.461
Your laughter is like music but if you
laugh at what I say next, I will die.

07:35.636 --> 07:39.420
For I am about to say something
very serious, perhaps shocking.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.910
Marge, my darling, I want
you to meet with me again.

07:43.268 --> 07:46.519
- That doesn't shock me.
- Away from prying eyes.

07:46.689 --> 07:50.140
At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace.

07:52.569 --> 07:54.811
Marge, speak to me!

07:55.572 --> 07:57.446
Is Thursday okay?

08:10.921 --> 08:13.377
Thank goodness I drove
down that ironic street.

08:14.717 --> 08:19.462
I made the right decision to stay with
my Homie, and there was no harm done.

08:20.723 --> 08:24.423
So if you mentally snip out the part
where I already had a husband...

08:24.601 --> 08:26.974
...that's my idea of romance.

08:27.187 --> 08:30.224
Marge, I want you
to stop seeing this Jacques.

08:30.399 --> 08:31.858
You can let him down gently...

08:32.260 --> 08:35.691
...but over the next couple of months,
I want you to break it off.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.440
Okay, Homer.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.614
That was a close one, kids.

08:42.244 --> 08:46.242
Okay, Marge. As long as
we're traumatizing the kids...

08:46.415 --> 08:49.416
...I have a scandalous story
of my own.

08:50.502 --> 08:54.200
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
your new coworker, Mindy Simmons.

08:54.173 --> 08:56.296
She has a degree in engineering
or something.

08:56.467 --> 08:57.629
Hi. How's it going?

08:57.843 --> 08:59.670
- Oh, pleased to meet you.
- Yeah, ditto.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.215
Hi.

09:05.517 --> 09:07.225
Homer, what's the matter?

09:07.394 --> 09:10.431
Ain't you never seen a naked chick
riding a clam before?

09:11.607 --> 09:13.660
Gotta go!

09:17.863 --> 09:21.777
I made it the whole day
without seeing her again.

09:22.618 --> 09:25.370
I mean, "Hello!"

09:25.662 --> 09:27.702
I guess we'll be going down together.

09:27.873 --> 09:30.411
- I mean, getting off togeth... I mean...
- That's okay.

09:30.584 --> 09:34.333
I'll just push the button for
the stimulator... I mean, elevator.

09:34.505 --> 09:37.921
Think unsexy thoughts, think unsexy
thoughts, think unsexy thoughts.

09:46.183 --> 09:47.843
Well, this is my floor.

09:51.522 --> 09:52.850
See you tomorrow!

09:53.650 --> 09:56.564
I tried to avoid her, but we were
sent to a nuclear convention together.

10:02.116 --> 10:03.776
TV's there. Bathroom's there.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.240
And there's your king-size bed for:

10:13.836 --> 10:15.116
- Hubba-hubba.
- Stop that.

10:15.296 --> 10:18.878
I love my wife and family. All I'll use
this bed for is sleeping, eating...

10:19.490 --> 10:21.719
...and maybe building a little fort.
That's it!

10:21.927 --> 10:26.803
Homer, I got a really wicked idea
that could get us into a lot of trouble.

10:26.974 --> 10:31.719
- Mindy. We have to fight our temptation.
- No, Homer.

10:31.895 --> 10:33.555
Let's do it.

10:33.731 --> 10:35.640
Let's call room service!

10:38.444 --> 10:40.650
Someone's charging room service
to the company.

10:40.863 --> 10:43.947
Well, we'll just see about that.

10:44.617 --> 10:48.863
Fly, my pretties. Fly!

10:54.418 --> 10:56.126
Continue the research.

10:58.630 --> 11:00.837
Thanks for poisoning the planet,
bastard!

11:01.800 --> 11:03.713
- Get bent!
- No more Chernobyls!

11:03.886 --> 11:06.440
Go to hell!

11:06.847 --> 11:09.890
I was doing my best to resist her...

11:09.266 --> 11:13.134
...but at dinner, the fortune cookie
predicted doom.

11:15.814 --> 11:18.305
"You will find happiness
with a new love."

11:18.484 --> 11:22.481
- This was a really nice night, Homer.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:24.615 --> 11:28.565
- What's wrong?
- Oh, yeah, like you don't know.

11:28.744 --> 11:31.615
We're gonna have sex.

11:31.830 --> 11:35.994
- Well, we don't have to.
- Yes, we do.

11:36.168 --> 11:37.995
The cookie told me so.

11:38.212 --> 11:41.248
Well, desserts aren't always right.

11:41.465 --> 11:43.700
But they're so sweet.

11:43.217 --> 11:44.877
Homer...

11:45.678 --> 11:47.884
...you know how I feel.

11:48.970 --> 11:50.670
So it's up to you.

11:51.183 --> 11:55.512
Look in your heart.
I think you'll see what you want.

12:10.494 --> 12:12.403
Oh, baby.

12:13.247 --> 12:16.912
This was a wonderful idea, Homie.

12:17.668 --> 12:20.585
- What happened to Mindy?
- Yes, what did happen to her?

12:20.796 --> 12:23.200
She hit the bottle hard
and lost her job.

12:23.507 --> 12:26.958
Good. Does anyone else
have a love story?

12:27.177 --> 12:31.507
Yes, I do. And just like your love stories,
it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings...

12:31.682 --> 12:33.425
...and scars that will never heal.

12:33.851 --> 12:36.556
It started, appropriately enough,
with an innocent boy...

12:36.770 --> 12:39.688
...being embarrassed
on Valentine's Day.

12:44.278 --> 12:46.685
Poor Ralph.

12:47.531 --> 12:49.607
Here you go, Ralph.

12:51.452 --> 12:55.449
- You "choo-choo-choose" me?
- Happy Valentine's.

12:59.918 --> 13:02.291
It was an unusually warm
February 14th...

13:02.504 --> 13:04.995
...so the children walked home
without jackets.

13:05.215 --> 13:08.880
Can I walk you home, valentine?

13:09.940 --> 13:10.589
Sure, I guess.

13:11.180 --> 13:14.465
That valentine sure was funny.

13:14.642 --> 13:16.136
Glad you liked it.

13:16.352 --> 13:22.188
It says "choo-choo-choose" me,
and there's a picture of a train.

13:22.399 --> 13:24.890
Yeah, nice gag.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.779
So...

13:28.989 --> 13:32.405
...do you like stuff?

13:35.370 --> 13:40.493
The doctor said I wouldn't have so many
nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of it.

13:40.709 --> 13:43.379
Well, here's my house.

13:50.302 --> 13:53.339
Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph.

13:55.391 --> 13:58.308
A Malibu Stacy convertible!

13:58.519 --> 14:02.180
"Look in the tunk."
He must mean "trunk."

14:04.983 --> 14:07.771
Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show!

14:08.195 --> 14:11.279
It's the Krusty the Clown
29th Anniversary Show!

14:15.619 --> 14:16.994
Thank you, thank you!

14:17.413 --> 14:21.245
- Lisa, you want a bite of my ice cream?
- No, thanks.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.747
Send it this way, boy.

14:25.546 --> 14:28.796
Nothing gets chocolate out. See?

14:28.966 --> 14:31.255
Now, for my favorite part
of the show...

14:31.468 --> 14:34.469
What does that say?
"Talk to the audience"?

14:34.680 --> 14:38.594
Oh, God, this is always death.
All right.

14:38.809 --> 14:41.150
Oh, no. Please don't
show me with Ralph.

14:42.146 --> 14:44.850
- What's your name, son?
- Ralph.

14:45.650 --> 14:48.660
- And is this your girlfriend, Ralph?
- Yes!

14:48.277 --> 14:52.321
I love Lisa Simpson! And when
I grow up, I'm going to marry her.

14:52.531 --> 14:54.820
No!

14:55.340 --> 14:58.319
Now, you listen to me!
I don't like you! I never liked you!

14:58.537 --> 15:00.613
The only reason I gave you
that valentine...

15:00.831 --> 15:02.954
...is because nobody else would!

15:03.125 --> 15:07.289
Watch this. You can actually pinpoint
the second when his heart rips in half.

15:08.213 --> 15:11.997
And now!

15:15.304 --> 15:18.471
Lisa, not all romances
turn out that way.

15:18.682 --> 15:22.466
Bart, do you have a love story
that doesn't end in heartbreak?

15:22.686 --> 15:24.145
Yes, I do.

15:24.354 --> 15:28.550
The only girl I ever loved
invited me up to the tree house.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.276
She had something
very important to tell me.

15:32.613 --> 15:36.290
I'm so happy, I just had to tell someone.

15:36.241 --> 15:37.866
I have a boyfriend.

15:41.372 --> 15:43.495
You won't be needing this.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.499
Wait, that did end in heartbreak.

15:55.719 --> 15:58.175
Thanks for opening up
old wounds, Ma.

16:08.148 --> 16:10.556
Well, as Jerry Lee Lewis would say:

16:10.776 --> 16:14.394
"There's a whole lot of frowning
going on."

16:18.242 --> 16:20.697
Mom, doesn't any love story
have a happy ending?

16:20.911 --> 16:24.991
Of course. Remember when...

16:25.249 --> 16:28.840
...your Aunt Selma got married?

16:29.628 --> 16:32.166
- Good.
- Soon I will kill you.

16:32.381 --> 16:33.875
Wait, wait, that's no good.

16:34.910 --> 16:37.377
I know. Your grandfather, remember?

16:37.553 --> 16:39.213
It started on an outing for dinner.

16:41.974 --> 16:43.966
Say, I've got a neat idea.

16:44.184 --> 16:47.304
Why don't you go in and pick up
my mother, and we'll go out to dinner.

16:47.521 --> 16:50.142
I'll be back in a jiffy.

16:54.690 --> 16:55.398
That's not my mother.

16:55.612 --> 16:58.103
I'll be back in a jiffy.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.822
Can I come too?

17:07.333 --> 17:11.329
They hit it off right away, but there
were rivals for the fair lady's hand.

17:11.211 --> 17:15.458
My favorite song. This is so nice.

17:15.674 --> 17:19.801
I can't remember when I've felt
this young.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.675
I really can't.

17:25.893 --> 17:28.728
Say, sport, mind if I have
the next dance?

17:28.938 --> 17:31.891
What the...? Don't sneak up on a...
Aren't you...?

17:32.107 --> 17:36.900
No need for the blown gasket, Charlie.
I'll have her back in one piece.

17:49.750 --> 17:54.661
But in the end, just when things
looked worst, true love triumphed.

17:56.882 --> 18:00.251
Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier,
take this man...

18:00.469 --> 18:03.636
...to be your lawfully wedded husband?

18:03.847 --> 18:06.932
Oh, Monty, my favorite song.
How did...?

18:07.142 --> 18:10.130
I specifically requested
no romantic music. What...?

18:10.229 --> 18:12.850
Mrs. Bouvier!

18:13.650 --> 18:15.936
Mrs. Bouvier!

18:17.444 --> 18:20.660
Mrs. Bouvier!

18:20.281 --> 18:23.732
Honey, are you sure you wanna be
Mrs. Montgomery Burns?

18:23.951 --> 18:28.613
Wouldn't you rather be
Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?

18:28.789 --> 18:30.200
No.

18:31.583 --> 18:34.740
- I don't wanna be either.
- Hot diggety damn!

18:34.294 --> 18:36.453
That's good enough for me.

18:51.562 --> 18:53.389
That doesn't seem like a happy ending.

18:53.731 --> 18:56.850
That seems more like a detached tale
of modern alienation.

18:57.670 --> 19:01.361
I give up. Did anybody learn
anything about love tonight?

19:01.572 --> 19:03.611
Yeah, learned it screws everybody up.

19:03.824 --> 19:07.904
Well, there's that side of it.
But there's also...

19:08.120 --> 19:09.579
Help me out here, Lisa.

19:09.788 --> 19:11.781
Sorry, Mom. I've decided
to save my love...

19:11.999 --> 19:16.162
...for someone who's guaranteed
not to reject me. Soon, Cory, soon.

19:20.382 --> 19:23.419
Well, kids, I tried.

19:23.635 --> 19:26.430
- But maybe you're right.
- Wait a minute, Marge.

19:26.263 --> 19:30.308
Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe
I'm no expert on the subject...

19:30.517 --> 19:33.435
...but there was one time
I got it right.

19:33.604 --> 19:38.562
Artie, I don't know. It was a
beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it.

19:38.776 --> 19:41.183
- Just this.
- Artie, please.

19:41.362 --> 19:46.356
- Come on, kiss me. Please.
- No, really, I mean it! Now stop it!

19:48.285 --> 19:50.954
- I'm sorry, Marge.
- Take me home.

20:01.965 --> 20:06.295
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
tell anybody about my busy hands.

20:06.512 --> 20:09.762
Not so much for myself,
but I'm so respected...

20:09.973 --> 20:14.185
...it would damage the town
to hear it. Good night.

20:14.395 --> 20:15.972
Yeah, right.

20:21.235 --> 20:25.233
Shut up! I'm over as far as I can go!

20:25.447 --> 20:30.193
All right! All right!
I'll walk in the mud!

20:31.370 --> 20:32.829
- Homer?
- Marge?

20:33.380 --> 20:35.660
- Yeah. You want a ride?
- Sure.

20:37.709 --> 20:42.300
When I got home, I realized
who I should've gone with.

20:42.214 --> 20:44.171
Who?

20:44.383 --> 20:48.879
- Hi, prom date.
- Marge, pour vous.

20:51.307 --> 20:54.889
- Why so glum?
- I got a problem.

20:56.145 --> 21:00.308
Once you stop this car,
I'm gonna hug you and kiss you...

21:00.524 --> 21:02.932
...and I'll never let you go.

21:03.777 --> 21:05.687
Your first kiss.

21:05.904 --> 21:08.111
But not the last.

21:23.213 --> 21:25.586
Homie.

21:28.844 --> 21:33.910
See, kids? That's what I meant
by romance.
