01:41.935 --> 01:44.938
Jerry, there you are.
I've been looking for you.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.149
You little cutie pie.

01:48.942 --> 01:53.738
Here, why don't you just snuggle on down
and take a little nap?

02:17.720 --> 02:19.931
Oh, it's that cat.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.225
Get him, Jerry.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.481
And this time,
don't you let him get away.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.435
Jerry? Oh, Jerry! Ugh!

03:05.435 --> 03:07.228
Get that cat out of here.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.441
Humph.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.948
Kicked out again, huh, Tom?

03:19.532 --> 03:23.578
Man, them mice sure make it hard
for us poor pussycats.

03:24.579 --> 03:29.125
Say, does anything about this whole
mouse-chases-cat situation...

03:29.125 --> 03:32.295
...seem a little screwy to you?

03:33.379 --> 03:35.131
Yeah, me neither.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.299
Just making conversation.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.040
Ahem.
Huh?

04:37.276 --> 04:38.695
Hmm.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.088
Phew.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.726
You crazy mouse.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.478
Are you off your cheese?

05:12.478 --> 05:17.984
You better concentrate on catching that cat
or else you are out.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.084
Your six minutes are up.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.045
I hope you enjoyed
your fantasy brain game.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.839
Please come back and see us again.

07:32.451 --> 07:33.411
Huh? Aah!

07:34.871 --> 07:36.289
Please don't hurt me, pal.

07:40.459 --> 07:41.669
Come on, pal.

07:41.669 --> 07:42.879
Show a little mercy.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.213
I'm a dog.

07:44.213 --> 07:47.300
I don't stand a chance against a cat.

08:12.074 --> 08:15.995
Oh, you're gonna have so much fun today
with your Uncle Jerry.

08:16.704 --> 08:20.791
I know you'll be just a perfect angel
for your uncle, won't you?

08:32.637 --> 08:34.764
Say hi to your Uncle Jer--

08:34.764 --> 08:36.182
Oh, Jerry.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.850
Don't tell me you forgot.

08:43.773 --> 08:48.945
Aw, see? I just know you two
will have a wonderful time together.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.073
Let me just give you a few things
you'll need.

08:52.865 --> 08:57.203
You're all set. See you this afternoon.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.930
Phew.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.075
Ooh.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.458
Huh?

10:40.097 --> 10:42.641
Thomas.
I'm so glad you're here, big brother.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.320
I need you to take care of Baby Booties
while I run a few errands.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.156
Eh, I'm sure he won't
be any problem at all.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.828
Goo-goo, ga-ga.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.248
That's Mommy's good little boy.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.833
Oh, and Thomas?

11:07.833 --> 11:11.295
Here are just a few little things you'll need
to take care of him.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.674
Bye-bye, baby.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.803
Be a good boy for your Uncle Tom.

11:39.281 --> 11:42.034
Ha. Huh? Ha-ha-ha.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.221
Ha. Hmm. Ha!

12:06.475 --> 12:07.893
Ha, hmm.

12:07.893 --> 12:08.894
Ha!

13:41.320 --> 13:43.822
Whoa! Rubber ducky.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.741
Rubber ducky!

13:47.576 --> 13:48.786
Rubber ducky?

14:48.512 --> 14:50.347
Mama! Ha, ha.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.668
Boo.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.403
Catch anything, pussycat?

17:26.420 --> 17:29.214
Well, hello, mousy. Catch anything?

17:36.513 --> 17:39.433
Wait a minute. Did I just see a mouse?

17:39.433 --> 17:40.809
I'm a catfish.

17:40.809 --> 17:44.062
I gotta get me that mousy.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.742
Come to Catfish Butch, mousy.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.581
You'll make one tasty snack.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.861
I'm gonna get you for that.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.358
Oh, mousy.

19:53.358 --> 19:57.195
You can swim, but you can't hide.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.419
I got you now, mousy.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.556
Get back here, cat.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.477
I'm a dogfish.
