Me too. Whoops!

Not gonna pack it in soon, huh?

08:46.827 --> 08:48.076
Uh-huh... huh?

08:48.128 --> 08:50.162
All right? I'll be honest with you.

08:50.214 --> 08:53.548
We really had some nice weather today.

08:53.584 --> 08:55.161
Uh-huh.

Here's a crazy thing.

09:08.849 --> 09:12.517
I went to dust the mantle earlier,
no dust.

09:12.569 --> 09:14.186
Hmm!

09:14.238 --> 09:16.571
Sheriff: You haven't touched your food.

09:16.607 --> 09:19.107
Something spoil your appetite?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.909
Hardly.

09:20.944 --> 09:25.664
Mama always said it's rude
to chew with your mouth open.

09:25.699 --> 09:29.201
Well, I'd love to chew the
fat with her some time.

09:29.253 --> 09:30.752
I already said "chew."

09:30.787 --> 09:31.836
Chew did?

09:31.872 --> 09:33.922
Isn't that just chew bad?

09:33.957 --> 09:36.041
[Laughs] Oh, this guy's a hoot, huh?

09:36.093 --> 09:39.044
You better watch your tongue, buddy boy.

09:39.096 --> 09:43.882
I'd rather use my tongue to
finish eating tonight's meal!

09:43.934 --> 09:44.933
Huh?!

09:44.968 --> 09:46.601
Wild Berry Gum!

09:46.637 --> 09:47.886
[Gasps] Got you!

09:47.888 --> 09:49.638
You're under arrest, gum thief!

09:49.690 --> 09:51.973
- Gum thief?
- You're gumming with me.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.643
And don't make me pull my gum.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.978
[Laughs] Oh, what's happening?

09:57.030 --> 10:03.652
Oh, I say, "pull my gum"
because it sounds like gun, you know?

10:03.704 --> 10:06.871
Yep,
if you think you're gonna eat somebody

10:06.907 --> 10:10.292
or steal gum in Old Town,
you better think again,

10:10.327 --> 10:12.410
'cause nothing gets by me.

10:12.412 --> 10:15.247
Hey! I love this song!

10:15.299 --> 10:17.916

Huh?!

[Flute plays]

10:43.827 --> 10:48.113
Well,
at least I won't be die-ning alone.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.197
