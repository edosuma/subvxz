TV COMMENTATOR:
Tonight in London,

00:28.227 --> 00:30.018
we have the night of nights.

00:30.053 --> 00:32.493
Damn, there is so much talent
in this city.

00:32.528 --> 00:35.364
The Triple-A rated
Bodyguard of the Year Awards.

00:35.399 --> 00:36.827
Now, these awards are given out

00:36.862 --> 00:39.500
to members of the executive
protection industry,

00:39.535 --> 00:41.601
those that carry
the Triple-A rating.

00:41.636 --> 00:43.669
It is the badge of honour.

00:45.376 --> 00:47.772
Who you most excited
to see tonight, Mike?

00:47.807 --> 00:48.905
MIKE: Oh, my God.

00:48.940 --> 00:50.148
I mean, there is only one

00:50.183 --> 00:51.710
white-hot favourite here, Steve.

00:51.745 --> 00:54.152
And this bodyguard
has had a tremendous year.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.846
His track record is untouchable.

00:55.881 --> 01:00.323
He has had the best client list,
the best evasive car manoeuvres,

01:00.358 --> 01:02.391
the best gun-handling skills.

01:02.426 --> 01:03.887
Christ, he even has
the best hair.

01:03.922 --> 01:07.231
And he actually insists
his clients wear seatbelts.

01:07.266 --> 01:09.101
That's how safe this guy is.

01:09.136 --> 01:11.466
He's the bodyguard that needs
no introduction.

01:11.501 --> 01:14.403
Michael Bryce is
the clear favourite this year.

-Oh, that's not too...

-Right.
-Mostly when I'm asleep.

03:14.624 --> 03:16.822
It's what my life
was supposed to be.

03:16.857 --> 03:19.363
I was the perfect
executive protection agent

03:19.398 --> 03:20.958
until I lost it all...

03:21.994 --> 03:24.863
..when Darius Kincaid killed
my most important client.

03:24.898 --> 03:26.304
(GUNSHOT)

03:27.230 --> 03:30.033
Darius Kincaid.
Is he a relative of yours?

03:30.068 --> 03:31.243
MICHAEL: God, no!

03:31.278 --> 03:32.970
He's a hit man wanted for, like,

03:33.005 --> 03:34.708
a zillion murders
around the world.

03:34.743 --> 03:36.710
Which is why,
when I protected him

03:36.745 --> 03:38.712
on a dangerous trip
across Europe

03:38.747 --> 03:41.385
so he could give evidence
at a war crimes trial -

03:41.420 --> 03:44.179
even took a bullet for him,
I might add -

03:44.214 --> 03:45.983
the Bodyguarding Committee,
they wouldn't...

03:46.018 --> 03:47.391
..they wouldn't recognise it.

03:47.426 --> 03:49.855
Apparently they don't take
kindly to protecting sociopaths.

03:49.890 --> 03:52.693
So in two weeks, I have to go
in front of a tribunal

03:52.728 --> 03:54.992
and try to get my
Triple-A rated licence back.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.466
To deal with the future,

03:56.501 --> 03:58.897
we sometimes have to
deal with the past.

03:58.932 --> 04:01.933
Now, is there anything
you want to talk about

04:01.968 --> 04:03.506
from your childhood, perhaps?

04:03.541 --> 04:06.003
And my childhood would be
relevant how?

04:06.038 --> 04:07.543
Well, quite often
validation issues

04:07.578 --> 04:09.204
stem from a disapproving father.

04:09.239 --> 04:12.042
I don't have validation issues.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.714
I have a licensing issue.

04:13.749 --> 04:15.914
I am a bodyguard
without a licence.

04:15.949 --> 04:20.424
That's like being a...
a belly dancer without a torso.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.592
What are you thinking about
right now, Michael?

04:24.595 --> 04:26.254
I'm thinking about
the fact that you're seated

04:26.289 --> 04:27.761
six feet away from
an exposed window with

04:27.796 --> 04:30.159
multiple sniper nest positions
on the building opposite,

04:30.194 --> 04:31.963
most likely on the eighth floor.

04:31.998 --> 04:34.405
The additional height
gives the marksman an advantage.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.604
I'm thinking about

04:35.639 --> 04:37.474
the closest available weapon
to me right now -

04:37.509 --> 04:39.509
the letter opener/
stabbing instrument

04:39.544 --> 04:41.907
on the desk to my right.

04:41.942 --> 04:43.348
What are you thinking about?

04:44.142 --> 04:47.275
I'm thinking you need to forget
bodyguarding for a while

04:47.310 --> 04:49.046
and find happiness within.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.179
Within what?

04:50.214 --> 04:51.488
Within yourself!

04:51.523 --> 04:54.392
Happiness in who you are.

04:56.022 --> 04:57.087
I'm listening.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.462
Well, first things first -

04:58.497 --> 05:01.091
I think all the guns
and violence are...

05:01.126 --> 05:02.631
..weighing on your soul.

05:02.666 --> 05:05.469
So you need to get away
and clear your mind

05:05.504 --> 05:08.934
and then you can find
your future self.

05:09.970 --> 05:11.871
Wait, wait, like...

05:11.906 --> 05:13.708
..like a cool...

05:13.743 --> 05:16.073
..futuristic bodyguard
with superpowers?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.580
No. Will you stop...

05:17.615 --> 05:20.880
Stop thinking about
bodyguarding. (CHUCKLES)

05:21.685 --> 05:23.586
Do you have
a dream vacation at all?

05:23.621 --> 05:26.050
I've heard Italy is lovely
at this time of year.

05:26.085 --> 05:27.557
So, how about Tuscany?

05:27.592 --> 05:30.285
No, not Tuscany. No Tuscany.
Anything but Tuscany.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.826
OK. Uh, Capri then?

05:32.861 --> 05:34.025
Capri?

05:34.060 --> 05:36.533
Like the pants?

05:37.866 --> 05:39.602
Also, a lot clients
find it helpful

05:39.637 --> 05:42.330
writing journal letters
to their future self.

05:42.365 --> 05:44.706
-Or recording voice memos.

05:45.973 --> 05:47.445

all the time. Joanne...

really great progress here.

05:55.719 --> 05:58.016
So do I. Yeah.

And don't feel like you need
to check in with me again.

your journey now.

get all the credit.

1:47:03.913 --> 1:47:06.782
Don't worry, baby,
I talked to Booby

1:47:06.817 --> 1:47:08.850

Don't talk to us like that,
you cheesy fuck.

We're not your bitches anymore.

1:47:18.026 --> 1:47:19.894
Relax.

1:47:19.929 --> 1:47:22.061
I got you your little yacht
for your honeymoon.

1:47:22.096 --> 1:47:23.128
Alright!

1:47:23.163 --> 1:47:25.295

the legals,

Uh, Bob, quick sidebar.

1:47:33.844 --> 1:47:36.339
No fucking sidebar
or I'll punch you in your face.

1:47:36.374 --> 1:47:37.681
OK.

1:47:37.716 --> 1:47:39.111
Fuck it.

1:47:41.313 --> 1:47:43.720
-And?
-Are you serious about that?

1:47:43.755 --> 1:47:44.688
Deadly.

1:47:44.723 --> 1:47:46.789

My baby cucaracha,

1:48:29.460 --> 1:48:31.867
you just signed
the adoption papers.

1:48:31.902 --> 1:48:34.639

-The adoption papers.
