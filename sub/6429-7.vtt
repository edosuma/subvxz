05:16.826 --> 05:18.794
- look, he has
a secret service tar,

05:18.861 --> 05:20.862

05:38.415 --> 05:42.217
If i an,
what mision he was on.

05:42.285 --> 05:44.219
- it looks like the blast
opened up the wall,

05:44.287 --> 05:46.855
And somehow people were fried.

05:46.923 --> 05:49.425
I mean, could an artifact
cause an explosion like that?

05:49.492 --> 05:53.362
- or did the explosion
release the artifact

05:53.430 --> 05:54.796
And then burn everybody up?

05:54.864 --> 05:56.865
- yeah, well, that is

06:15.551 --> 06:19.188
Never quite caught up
to the omputer age.

06:19.255 --> 06:20.389

- except this time no gas leak.

11:32.969 --> 11:34.435
But there was also a rumor

11:34.504 --> 11:36.705
That edward teller was working
on a miro-fision thing,

11:36.772 --> 11:37.806
But i don't think it's that.

11:37.874 --> 11:39.273
- well, here's a wrinkle.

11:39.341 --> 11:41.442
There's a handprint
on the bodies.

11:41.511 --> 11:42.844
It's the only part not burned,

11:42.912 --> 11:45.079
And our only uspect
was one of the vitims.

11:45.147 --> 11:46.481
It was like he was,

11:46.549 --> 11:48.950
I don't know, followed
from the polie station, artie.

11:49.018 --> 11:50.519
- oh, no,
not like he was followed.

11:50.586 --> 11:51.920
He was hased.

11:51.988 --> 11:53.388
I don't think
that these deaths are random.

11:53.455 --> 11:55.891
- so maybe omebody
at the tation last night

11:55.958 --> 11:57.592
Found the artifact,
whatever it i,

11:57.660 --> 11:59.561
And used it to ettle
some old scores.

11:59.629 --> 12:01.229
- yeah, okay, you know what?
you trace the victims.

12:01.296 --> 12:02.564
You see if they've got
any enemies,

12:02.632 --> 12:03.899
Then maybe you an get
ahead of this guy

12:03.966 --> 12:05.867
Before he settles more...
score.

12:05.935 --> 12:07.435
Okay? bye.

12:07.503 --> 12:09.938
Yeah, if that's what it was,
whih i really doubt.

12:10.006 --> 12:12.741
Would it have killed you
to leave a note?

12:16.478 --> 12:19.047
- captain powell.
- yes?

12:19.114 --> 12:20.815
- did you know that every one
of these burn victims

12:20.883 --> 12:22.083
Were member of the same gang?

12:22.151 --> 12:23.618
- and they were brought in
the other night

12:23.686 --> 12:25.987
After an altercation
with a rival gang.

12:26.055 --> 12:27.722
I mean, could thi be payback?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.290
- it's just what we need--

12:29.358 --> 12:31.292
A turf war with a new kind
of weapon in play.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.628
- okay, we're gonna need,
um, names, addresse,

12:33.696 --> 12:35.163
Whatever you've got.

12:35.230 --> 12:38.266
- the head of our gang unit,
sergeant lark, i out on leave.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.534

12:43.806 --> 12:45.740

this is his latest tuff.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.742
Will you need
a blue-and-white escort?

12:47.810 --> 12:49.444
- no, no.
we an handle it.

12:49.511 --> 12:50.912

13:17.673 --> 13:18.907

- he's on r & r, right.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.707
Could we get hi address?
we ould use hi expertise.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.110
- [scoffs]

20:36.178 --> 20:37.711
Give me a second.

20:40.916 --> 20:43.651
- so the volatile lead
of the gang unit

20:43.718 --> 20:44.952
Is on mandated leave.

20:45.020 --> 20:47.488
- while gang member
get mysteriously killed

20:47.556 --> 20:50.425
By what looks to be a cop.

20:50.492 --> 20:54.195
What do you think--
two plus two equals four?

20:54.263 --> 20:56.397
- have you ever stopped
by the offie on your day off?

20:56.465 --> 20:57.898
- no, but i'm sure you have.

20:57.966 --> 21:01.869
- mm, sergeant lark and i

21:06.875 --> 21:09.743
[electricity crackling]

21:13.582 --> 21:16.417

21:22.958 --> 21:24.192
[electricity crackling]

21:24.259 --> 21:26.026
- you hear that?

21:26.095 --> 21:28.563
Look at that.

21:31.567 --> 21:33.534

21:40.742 --> 21:42.710
Sergeant lark?

21:45.714 --> 21:46.614
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:46.681 --> 21:47.648

21:49.551 --> 21:50.384
- clark, no!

21:57.959 --> 21:59.427
Come on.

22:08.036 --> 22:10.771
He went down here.

22:10.839 --> 22:12.573
[electricity crackling]

22:12.641 --> 22:14.642
There!

22:18.913 --> 22:21.115
- [breathing heavily]

22:21.183 --> 22:23.751
He's dead.

22:25.621 --> 22:27.855
Help me.

22:27.922 --> 22:29.157
[grunts]

22:29.224 --> 22:31.659
- ooh.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.060
- that thing--

22:33.128 --> 22:34.962
It's gone.

22:38.433 --> 22:39.367
[exhales deeply]

22:56.087 --> 22:58.556
- okay, just tell me
that lark's body

22:58.624 --> 23:00.858
Is on the way to me right now.

23:00.925 --> 23:02.260
- no, powell took it.

23:02.327 --> 23:04.428
- oh, for god--you know,
i-i just don't have time

23:04.496 --> 23:06.397
To play bureaucracy games
to get it back!

23:06.465 --> 23:08.533
- i sent you a bunch of pictures
that laudia asked for.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.334
- yeah, great, pitures.
- got them.

23:10.402 --> 23:12.136
- look, there was something
on his back, artie,

23:12.204 --> 23:15.939
Some kind of a nasty, metalli
lobster-looking thingy,

23:16.007 --> 23:17.175
And it's gone now.

23:17.242 --> 23:19.210
- okay, so maybe, you know,
if we find out

23:19.278 --> 23:20.511
What that thingy was,

23:20.579 --> 23:22.547
Then we can track
where it went.

23:22.614 --> 23:24.282
And you say
that it also leaves a body

23:24.349 --> 23:26.116
When the body die, maybe.

23:26.185 --> 23:27.418
Okay, that's a good start.

23:27.486 --> 23:29.387
Please, tell me
that you have something else.

23:29.454 --> 23:31.689
- well, it looked
like it was fused to hi back.

23:31.756 --> 23:32.723
- ho--hold--hold it.
i got an idea.

23:32.791 --> 23:33.857
Yes, we'll do it right now.

23:33.925 --> 23:35.459
Now, ome on, come on.
- ohhhhh.

23:35.527 --> 23:38.962
- right. right away, just do it.
one, two, three.

23:39.030 --> 23:40.198
- ugh.
- go do your thing.

23:40.265 --> 23:41.532
Do your thing.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.201
All right, talk to me.

23:43.268 --> 23:44.835
- it gave off arcs
of electricity.

23:44.903 --> 23:46.504
It must be
how he burned thoe people.

23:46.572 --> 23:48.406
- you got it?
- yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:48.473 --> 23:49.740
- all right.

23:49.808 --> 23:51.842
So, uh, the eletriity--

23:51.910 --> 23:55.045
Did it emanate from clark
or from the artifact?

23:55.113 --> 23:56.046
- both.

23:56.114 --> 23:57.781
- okay, you know what?

23:57.849 --> 24:01.852
So that just ompletely
eliminate our last possibility.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.821
All right, just--
did it have buttons?

24:03.888 --> 24:06.056
Did it have wires?
did it have an antenna?

24:06.124 --> 24:07.825
- hey, artie.
- yeah.

24:07.892 --> 24:09.760
- digital rendering shows jack
had something on his back too.

24:09.828 --> 24:12.530
- okay, just, uh...

24:12.598 --> 24:14.131
All right,
can you guys hear me?

24:14.199 --> 24:15.333
- yeah.
- yeah.

24:15.400 --> 24:19.270
- okay, attached
to the vertebra

24:19.338 --> 24:23.207
At t-2, 4 7, and 9

24:23.275 --> 24:26.944
And accesse
the spinal ord, i think.

24:27.011 --> 24:28.613
I can't really tell.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.681
Listen to me.
jack seord, when he died,

24:30.749 --> 24:32.783
Did not just have
this artifact with him.

24:32.851 --> 24:34.418
<i>he had it on him.</i>

24:34.486 --> 24:38.222
I mean, thi thing was like some
kind of a--it's like a parasite.

24:38.290 --> 24:40.691
- well, dude,
ripley's believe it or not--

24:40.759 --> 24:42.126
Same   markings on lark's back.

24:42.193 --> 24:44.328
- all right, did you get that?
clark's back too.

24:44.396 --> 24:45.796
- so what power it, artie?

24:45.864 --> 24:47.965
I mean, it must be drawing
eletriity from somewhere

24:48.032 --> 24:49.634
To electrocute people
the way it did.

24:49.701 --> 24:51.034
- yeah, okay,
i'll just add that

24:51.102 --> 24:52.870
To our already-huge list
of questions.

24:52.937 --> 24:54.639
Thank you.
all right, good-bye.

24:57.409 --> 24:58.842
- what?

24:58.910 --> 25:00.344
- what? what are you--
you got something?

25:00.412 --> 25:01.945
- eletroution--

25:02.013 --> 25:03.547
That's the word rebeca used,

25:03.615 --> 25:04.948
But we didn't know
it did that yet.

25:05.016 --> 25:05.883
We hadn't figured it out.

25:07.452 --> 25:09.219
- oh.
- mm-hmm.

25:09.288 --> 25:10.621

25:12.891 --> 25:14.358
- i don't know
what you're talking about.

25:14.426 --> 25:16.894
- you asked if there were
any more electrocutions.

25:16.961 --> 25:19.062
What exactly
did you mean by that?

25:19.130 --> 25:21.299
- i heard it on the new.

25:21.366 --> 25:23.967
- no, it was never mentioned
in the news.

25:24.035 --> 25:27.070

25:30.108 --> 25:32.976

25:35.980 --> 25:38.182
You didn't ome in from d.c.

25:38.249 --> 25:41.885
The unexplained eletroutions
raied a flag.

25:41.953 --> 25:44.154
You found jack,

25:44.222 --> 25:48.659
And you finally figured out
there was an artifact.

25:48.727 --> 25:50.795
You're
from south dakota, right?

25:53.097 --> 25:55.433
Thi artifact
that jack was hunting for

25:55.500 --> 25:57.100
Before he disappeared--

25:57.168 --> 25:59.269
It's active again.

25:59.338 --> 26:01.539

26:19.958 --> 26:21.925

a nasty lobster-looking thing.

26:21.993 --> 26:23.293

This writing...

26:33.472 --> 26:35.172
I very...

26:35.240 --> 26:36.306
Old.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.075
I have no idea
what that writing i.

26:38.142 --> 26:40.811
- well, you want me to, uh,
you know, scan it in,

26:40.879 --> 26:41.912
Do my thing?

26:41.980 --> 26:43.046

26:46.017 --> 26:47.651
- that's wrong.
- yeah.

26:47.719 --> 26:51.489
- uh, you left before i could be
certain you were warehouse.

26:51.556 --> 26:55.693
I wanted to share thi
with you--

26:55.761 --> 26:59.363
What i dug up back then,
what i think jack was following.

26:59.431 --> 27:01.098
There'd been
several unexplained deaths,

27:01.165 --> 27:03.567
Burned bodies.

27:03.635 --> 27:05.669
It tarted at a museum

27:05.737 --> 27:09.273
Shortly after an 11h-century
exhibit passed through.

27:09.340 --> 27:11.876
I couldn't find a connetion,

27:11.943 --> 27:15.078
But jack had vibe
about thee things--

27:15.146 --> 27:16.213
Very annoying.

27:19.651 --> 27:22.787
He must've tarted
to invetigate, and then...

27:22.854 --> 27:24.822
Then he just disappeared.

27:24.890 --> 27:28.325
I always knew
if we didn't quit,

27:28.393 --> 27:31.796
One of us, one day,
would lose the other.

27:33.465 --> 27:35.433
But for jack,

27:35.500 --> 27:37.401
The warehouse
was his first love.

27:37.469 --> 27:40.771
Till death do them part.

27:42.808 --> 27:44.207
I scoured the crime scenes,

27:44.275 --> 27:46.610
But i never found any answers.

27:48.713 --> 27:51.248
- you never went
back to the warehouse?

27:51.316 --> 27:53.851
- i couldn't do that.

27:53.919 --> 27:57.321
Changed my last name,
just disappeared.

27:57.388 --> 28:01.091
I stayed in st. louis,
hoping to find him one day--

28:01.159 --> 28:04.495
Maybe lost, confused.

28:06.431 --> 28:09.199
Eventually my life was here.

28:09.267 --> 28:11.368
- myka.

28:11.436 --> 28:12.870
Does this
look familiar to you?

28:12.938 --> 28:15.606
- that's what we aw
on--on lark's back.

28:15.674 --> 28:17.107
That's--that's the devie.

28:19.277 --> 28:21.545
- that's jack's handwriting.

28:21.613 --> 28:24.682
- jack knew
what he was looking for.

28:24.749 --> 28:26.917
[farnworth buzzing]

28:26.985 --> 28:30.120
- are you still using
that old thing?

28:30.188 --> 28:31.388
- [chuckles]

28:31.456 --> 28:32.990
Yeah, right?
- okay, can you see thi?

28:33.057 --> 28:34.324
Thi is what
you're looking for.

28:34.392 --> 28:36.927
It's alled
"the pine of the saracen."

28:36.995 --> 28:39.329
- oh, okay, great.
uh, so it has a name?

28:39.397 --> 28:41.799
What is a saracen?
- a saracen's a turk.

28:41.867 --> 28:44.869
Now, liten, there's a legend
that during the firt crusade,

28:44.936 --> 28:46.470
The turks
had thi elite warrior ult,

28:46.538 --> 28:48.772
And thee warrior
were rumored to be unstoppable

28:48.840 --> 28:50.508
For some reason
in the field of battle.

28:50.575 --> 28:52.576
What i'm thinking
i that the spine--

28:52.644 --> 28:54.344
Can you see thi?

28:54.412 --> 28:57.548
The spine
was speifially deigned

28:57.616 --> 29:00.083
As a weapon
for these warriors.

29:00.151 --> 29:02.887
- 11th entury--it's the ame
as the museum exhibit.

29:02.954 --> 29:03.888
- what exhibit?

29:03.955 --> 29:05.489
- well, we found pitures too.

29:05.557 --> 29:08.091
Uh, something happened
at a museum exhibit

29:08.159 --> 29:09.960
That jack secord stumbled on.

29:10.028 --> 29:11.962
Rebeca showed us thi.

29:12.030 --> 29:15.098
- so maybe this thing was sealed
and it got out omehow.

29:15.166 --> 29:17.100
- okay, so if we find it,

29:17.168 --> 29:18.502
How can we top it?

29:18.570 --> 29:21.005
- yeah, okay, well, i'm
deciphering the text right now.

29:21.072 --> 29:22.606
It's a little diffiult,
but i'm trying.

29:22.674 --> 29:24.174
It's the words
under thi drawing,

29:24.242 --> 29:28.512
And looely translated,
it ays,

29:28.580 --> 29:32.449
"the pine requires
a lifetime ommitment."

29:32.517 --> 29:35.052
- oh, yeah, man, i had
a girlfriend like that once.

29:35.119 --> 29:37.187
- [chuckles]
- [laughs]

29:37.255 --> 29:40.524
- so--so this thing must get
its power from omewhere, right?

29:40.592 --> 29:43.027
So if we shut down it oure,
can we stop it?

29:43.094 --> 29:46.129
- yeah, well, you know, when
i figure it out, you know what?

29:46.197 --> 29:48.231
You'll be the second to know.

29:48.299 --> 29:50.233
- so this--this spine--

29:50.301 --> 29:52.235
You know, it's probably still
at lark's apartment.

29:52.303 --> 29:54.171
- so we should get there
before omebody else finds it.

29:54.238 --> 29:57.741
- now, jack was
a very good agent, the best.

29:57.809 --> 29:59.176
You be areful.

29:59.243 --> 30:01.411
- yeah, we will.

30:13.507 --> 30:16.075
- okay, so the last time
we saw lark alive,

30:16.143 --> 30:18.544
He ran into this alley,
so we should tart here?

30:18.612 --> 30:20.779
- well, unless you want to look
under the arch.

30:20.847 --> 30:23.149
- [laughs]

30:23.217 --> 30:25.184
- aah! help!

30:25.252 --> 30:26.486
- what is that?

30:26.553 --> 30:27.720
- help me!

30:27.787 --> 30:29.255
Help me!
- hey!

30:29.323 --> 30:30.656
- hey, hey, hold it!
hold it! hold it!

30:30.724 --> 30:32.325
- he's trying to kill me!
- bring the gun here.

30:32.392 --> 30:34.860
- i shot him.
i shot him in the chest,

30:34.928 --> 30:37.563
And he just kept oming at me.
- who are you talking about?

30:37.631 --> 30:41.000
- [grunting loudly]

30:41.067 --> 30:42.201
- oh, god.

30:43.703 --> 30:47.039
- okay, now would be a good time
to take the shot.

30:47.107 --> 30:49.242
- [grunting]

30:49.309 --> 30:51.877
- [grunts, breathing heavily]

30:51.945 --> 30:53.812
Okay, that didn't work.
pete!

30:53.880 --> 30:56.682
- no, but the good news i,
we've pissed him off.

30:56.750 --> 30:58.884
- okay, stop it!
we're on your side!

30:58.952 --> 31:01.220
- [grunting loudly]
please help me.

31:01.288 --> 31:04.123
[breathing heavily]

31:04.191 --> 31:05.958
Please help me.

31:06.026 --> 31:07.260
- god.

31:08.562 --> 31:11.164
[grunts, breathing heavily]

31:11.231 --> 31:13.366
Oh, god.
- vince.

31:13.433 --> 31:15.034
What happened?
i he--

31:15.101 --> 31:16.235
- he's gone.

31:16.303 --> 31:18.137
[breathing heavily]

31:18.205 --> 31:19.738
- he was my ex-husband.

31:19.806 --> 31:21.840
There was a restraining order,
but i've never een him--

31:21.908 --> 31:24.443
- wait.
it's gone.

31:24.511 --> 31:25.878
- but how?
- [shriek]

31:25.945 --> 31:27.547
- ma'am, get
out of the area now.

31:27.614 --> 31:28.514
Now!

31:28.582 --> 31:30.082
- pete!

31:33.053 --> 31:35.020
Do you ee it?
[breathing heavily]

31:35.088 --> 31:36.255
- no.

31:36.323 --> 31:37.423
Do you?

31:37.491 --> 31:38.357
- no.

31:44.198 --> 31:46.265
[breathing heavily]

31:52.706 --> 31:54.773
- look out!

31:54.841 --> 31:56.909
[creaming]

31:56.976 --> 31:59.545
- pete! pete!

31:59.613 --> 32:02.114
Pete!
pete, what's going--

32:02.182 --> 32:03.749
- [continues screaming]

32:03.817 --> 32:04.817
Pete, don't move!

32:04.884 --> 32:05.884
- i'm okay.

32:05.952 --> 32:07.420
- okay, just let me call artie.

32:07.487 --> 32:08.821
- [grunting loudly]
- all right, just let me--

32:08.888 --> 32:10.323
- no, stay away!

32:10.390 --> 32:11.990
I don't want to hurt yo--

32:12.058 --> 32:15.294
[screaming]

32:23.870 --> 32:27.172
- agent bering.

32:27.241 --> 32:29.875
Agent bering.

32:29.943 --> 32:31.444
Agent bering.

32:31.511 --> 32:32.712
Are you okay?

32:34.981 --> 32:36.582
- where's pete?

32:36.650 --> 32:38.817
- i don't know, he's not here.
what happened?

32:38.885 --> 32:41.120
- the same thing
that happened to lark

32:41.187 --> 32:42.988
And jack,

32:43.056 --> 32:45.157
It's happening to pete.

32:45.225 --> 32:46.992
I--i have to go find him.

32:47.060 --> 32:48.728
- hang on one second.
you were knocked out.

32:48.795 --> 32:50.296
We need to all an ambulance.

32:50.364 --> 32:52.064
- i'm fine, okay?

32:52.132 --> 32:54.367
Just--just exuse me.
i have to go.

32:56.737 --> 32:59.004
- the spine was designed
for one thing.

32:59.072 --> 33:01.006
It turns a person
into a killing machine.

33:01.074 --> 33:02.908
It's a warrior-maker.

33:02.976 --> 33:05.010
It uses the body
like a big battery,

33:05.078 --> 33:06.845
Heightening and redirecting

33:06.913 --> 33:09.582
The host's natural
eletrial impulses.

33:09.650 --> 33:11.350
- yeah, it's like
ancient pcp.

33:11.418 --> 33:13.486
It jacks up your adrenaline
and testoterone.

33:13.553 --> 33:15.454
So on a scale of 1 to 1,
you're about a 25.

33:15.522 --> 33:17.290
- until the battery i drained
and the barbs retract.

33:17.357 --> 33:19.158
It lies dormant just waiting

33:19.225 --> 33:20.993
For the next nearest
living hot

33:21.060 --> 33:22.395
To latch onto.

33:22.462 --> 33:24.730
- artie,
the spine is on pete.

33:28.935 --> 33:30.770
- okay, where is he
right now?

33:30.837 --> 33:32.070
- i don't know.

33:32.138 --> 33:33.939
Just tell me
that you an remove it.

33:34.007 --> 33:35.408
- we will, we will.

33:35.475 --> 33:37.677
There's a way.
there's always a way, myka.

33:39.746 --> 33:41.714
- artie, liten to me,
i can't, um--

33:41.782 --> 33:45.351
I will not loe
another partner.

33:45.419 --> 33:47.953
Just the look
in pete's eye.

33:48.021 --> 33:49.388
Artie, he looked--

33:49.456 --> 33:50.856
I've never een him
so angry.

33:50.924 --> 33:52.425
- that's not pete.
that's the artifact.

33:52.492 --> 33:54.327
It just--
it feeds on aggresion.

33:54.394 --> 33:57.062
- it makes you go after
what you hate, right?

33:57.130 --> 33:58.964
Clark went after the gangs,

33:59.032 --> 34:02.067
And the last vitim
went after his ex-wife.

34:02.135 --> 34:03.502
- a warrior
that's been programmed

34:03.570 --> 34:04.637
To kill his enemies.

34:04.705 --> 34:06.372
- jack fought it.

34:06.440 --> 34:09.174
He fought his feelings
long enough

34:09.242 --> 34:10.576
So that he ould
seal himself up

34:10.643 --> 34:11.877
And not hurt anyone.

34:11.945 --> 34:13.277
- what are you aying, myka?

34:13.347 --> 34:15.547
You think pete is gonna do
exactly the same thing?

34:15.614 --> 34:18.317
- i don't know.

34:18.385 --> 34:20.152
Artie, what do i do
when i find him?

34:20.219 --> 34:22.020
- what have you got?

34:22.088 --> 34:23.389
Claudia, just tell me
anything you've got.

34:23.456 --> 34:25.558
- okay, hold up,
so when thi thing was built,

34:25.625 --> 34:26.925
Eletriity
didn't exist yet, right?

34:26.993 --> 34:28.360
So it'd zap people,

34:28.428 --> 34:30.295
But what would happen
if it got zapped?

34:30.364 --> 34:32.197
I mean, that's what
the bolt of lightning was

34:32.264 --> 34:33.264
In the piture
that they found.

34:33.333 --> 34:34.299
Remember, jack wrote--

34:34.368 --> 34:35.735
Both: hand of god.

34:35.802 --> 34:37.135
- maybe that's what
shuts down the spine,

34:37.203 --> 34:38.437
A bolt of lightning.

34:38.505 --> 34:40.105
Overwhelming
the spine's receptors

34:40.172 --> 34:41.540
Might make it
automatically detach.

34:41.608 --> 34:42.742
- that's not bad.

34:42.809 --> 34:44.443
Just turn the tesla's power
to full.

34:44.511 --> 34:46.712
- no, artie, look,
we already tried that.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.681
- all right, liten, myka,

34:49.750 --> 34:51.650
Find pete.

34:51.717 --> 34:53.418
Your tesla's
not strong enough,

34:53.487 --> 34:55.855
So you'll have to find
a powerful electrical source

34:55.922 --> 34:57.590
Somehow, omewhere.

35:01.695 --> 35:03.929
- he's gonna take a bullet.

35:03.997 --> 35:05.498
- what?

35:05.565 --> 35:08.300
- that's what we're
trained to do, isn't it?

35:08.368 --> 35:09.968
Every secret ervice agent
will take the bullet

35:10.036 --> 35:12.438
For the preident,
for his country.

35:12.506 --> 35:14.006
That's what jack did.

35:14.073 --> 35:15.908
He acrificed himself.

35:15.975 --> 35:18.744
That's what pete's
going to do now.

35:18.812 --> 35:20.513
- no, because pete--

35:20.580 --> 35:23.282
Pete know that the spine
will just lath on

35:23.349 --> 35:24.717
To another person.

35:24.785 --> 35:25.918
- then he's going
to make sure.

35:25.985 --> 35:27.887
That's what jack did.

35:27.954 --> 35:29.722
- agent bering,

35:29.790 --> 35:31.557
Your partner lattimer,
two of my men

35:31.625 --> 35:33.091
Just aw him headed back
to the tation house.

35:33.159 --> 35:35.394
- what--
why would he--

35:35.462 --> 35:36.762
The generator.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.564
- he's found
his bolt of lightning.

35:58.399 --> 36:00.567
- lattimer.
lattimer!

36:00.635 --> 36:02.402
Stop.

36:02.470 --> 36:06.473
- get out!

36:06.541 --> 36:07.841
- powell, wait!

36:07.909 --> 36:09.276
Wait.

36:09.343 --> 36:11.111
Look, it hannels anger.

36:11.179 --> 36:14.782
Okay, you have to go outside.
please, just go.

36:14.849 --> 36:16.316
- [breathing heavily]

36:16.384 --> 36:19.286
- pete, it's gonna be okay.

36:19.353 --> 36:20.888
Okay, artie can fix thi.

36:20.955 --> 36:25.492
- the spine require
a lifetime ommitment.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.294
You can't help me.

36:27.361 --> 36:28.929
- yes, i an, okay?

36:28.997 --> 36:30.430
You just--
you just have to--

36:30.498 --> 36:33.300
- no!

36:33.367 --> 36:36.269
I can feel it.

36:36.337 --> 36:39.272
Thi thing is stronger
than i am.

36:39.340 --> 36:41.274
I don't think i can fight it
much longer.

36:41.342 --> 36:42.676
- yes, you an.
yes, you an.

36:42.744 --> 36:44.477
Okay, we an find
a solution.

36:44.545 --> 36:46.513
We an lok you up
until we find an answer.

36:46.581 --> 36:48.548
- like jack?

36:48.616 --> 36:50.918
Buried for all those year

36:50.985 --> 36:53.020
To have that thing
come back to life?

36:53.088 --> 36:55.388
No!

36:55.456 --> 36:58.458
It's gotta end here.

36:58.526 --> 37:00.994
I have to die.

37:01.062 --> 37:03.663
And i have to take
the spine with me.

37:03.732 --> 37:05.899
You undertand, right?

37:05.967 --> 37:07.134
- pete.

37:07.202 --> 37:08.602
- take these...

37:08.669 --> 37:11.338
And clamp them
to the spine.

37:11.405 --> 37:15.242
I tried, but i--

37:15.309 --> 37:17.611
I can't reach.

37:17.678 --> 37:21.348
If i mis,
i'll just kill myself

37:21.415 --> 37:24.017
And it will attach
to its next victim.

37:24.085 --> 37:26.686
Myka, you've got
to do thi.

37:26.755 --> 37:29.123
- pete, i can't.

37:29.190 --> 37:30.758
- please!

37:30.825 --> 37:32.226
Please.

37:36.765 --> 37:38.431
[cream]

37:56.151 --> 37:58.685
[groans]

37:58.753 --> 37:59.753
- pete, listen to me.

37:59.821 --> 38:01.688
Pete!

38:01.756 --> 38:03.657
You will ome back.

38:03.724 --> 38:05.692
Do you hear me?

38:05.760 --> 38:07.161
You will.

38:10.832 --> 38:11.799
- do it.

38:15.236 --> 38:17.304
- [creaming]

38:25.814 --> 38:27.147
Oh, god!

38:50.839 --> 38:52.605
- oh, god.

38:52.673 --> 38:54.875
Come on.

38:54.943 --> 38:56.944
Damn it.

39:00.581 --> 39:02.349
Come on, pete.

39:02.416 --> 39:03.984
[panting]

39:04.052 --> 39:05.585
Don't leave.

39:05.653 --> 39:07.454
Come on, pete.

39:07.521 --> 39:08.722
Come on!

39:14.795 --> 39:16.330

39:30.144 --> 39:33.180
I'm okay.

39:33.248 --> 39:36.516
Oh, god.

39:39.587 --> 39:41.388

39:43.124 --> 39:45.092

40:06.480 --> 40:08.581
Hello, i'm artie.

40:08.649 --> 40:11.651
I wanted to be 100% certain

40:11.719 --> 40:14.254
That this thing
would never again

See the light of day.

40:16.024 --> 40:19.592
- absolutely.

40:32.773 --> 40:34.841
Thank you.

40:34.909 --> 40:37.544
So i was wondering,

40:37.611 --> 40:39.246
We ould always use
an extra pair of hands.

40:39.314 --> 40:41.949
- use--
that's the perfect word.

40:42.016 --> 40:45.419
Like i said, this place
hasn't hanged very much.

40:45.486 --> 40:46.886
And it never will.

40:46.955 --> 40:48.956
It hate to let go
of anything.

40:49.023 --> 40:50.857
Thank you,

40:50.925 --> 40:53.693
But no thank you.

40:53.761 --> 40:57.597
I came here
to omplete jack's mision.

40:57.665 --> 41:00.934
Now i'm going home.

41:01.002 --> 41:02.502

41:02.570 --> 41:03.770
- oh, right.

41:03.838 --> 41:06.373
Rebeca, just...

41:06.441 --> 41:07.841
There i one last thing

41:07.908 --> 41:09.776
That you might

41:23.858 --> 41:26.626

41:26.694 --> 41:27.660
Hmm.

41:27.728 --> 41:30.097

41:32.967 --> 41:33.900
Oh.

41:33.968 --> 41:36.269

41:36.337 --> 41:38.805
Rebeca, there's

41:38.873 --> 41:41.108
In jack's desk
