           - Nobody...          

01:23:35.011 --> 01:23:35.509
           - Burn it.           

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:36.210
           - Nobody...          

01:23:36.212 --> 01:23:37.277
           - Alcohol.           

01:23:37.279 --> 01:23:38.645
          - Pops this.          

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:41.515
    - That weird shit dad has   
    in the medicine cabinet.    

01:23:41.517 --> 01:23:43.450
     - See what kind of shit    
     I've got to deal with.     

01:23:43.452 --> 01:23:46.020
      I tell you every time     
     why it's not possible.     

01:23:46.022 --> 01:23:47.454
         Why do you keep        
       trying to burn me?       

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:49.723
Alcohol, it's not going to work.

01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:50.724
     You don't listen to me.    

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:52.226
    She never listen's to me.   

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.400
       - See what you did.      

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:01.168
     Why are you doing this?    

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:04.271
  You, you're embarrassing me.  

01:24:04.273 --> 01:24:07.341
    - Ahh, yeah. Look at me.    
     Look at me, huh, yeah.     

01:24:07.343 --> 01:24:09.376
    What have I got. Nothing.   

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:11.678
       My own creator is        
       ashamed I exist.         

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.049
     Fine. Cover me up like     
     a dirty fucking secret.    

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.586
   - What is this going to do?  

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:20.621
             [slap]             

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:21.488
             - Ohh!             

01:24:23.125 --> 01:24:25.292
     - I mean what the hell     
       is wrong with you?       

01:24:25.294 --> 01:24:27.594
         - Have you lost        
       your pissing mind?       

01:24:29.598 --> 01:24:30.664
        - Ohh, oh my god.       

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:32.232
       I mean look at it.       

01:24:33.536 --> 01:24:34.334
             - God!             

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:38.639
          - I'm sorry.          

01:24:40.276 --> 01:24:41.508
           I'm sorry.           

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.178
           I'm sorry.           

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:45.746
     - You were right about     
       your big old hand.       

01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:46.814
      Now stop touching me.     

01:24:46.816 --> 01:24:48.749
            - Aghhhh!           

01:24:51.454 --> 01:24:52.853
           - Aghhhhhh!          

01:24:54.156 --> 01:24:55.389
       - I will kill you!       

01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:56.123
              - No!             

01:24:56.125 --> 01:24:57.458
            - Ohhhh!            

01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:01.528
       - You're worth it!       

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:03.397
       - You're killing...      

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:05.265
       - You kill me, you       
         kill missy too.        

01:25:06.802 --> 01:25:08.735
       - Wait, wait, wait.      
       What's that. Wait.       

01:25:10.239 --> 01:25:11.472
          - What, what.         

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:14.608
            - Aghhh!            

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:17.511
        - Get off of me!        

01:25:18.514 --> 01:25:20.114
     - What are we gonna do?    

01:25:21.117 --> 01:25:22.282
          - Talk to me.         

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.452
          I don't know.         

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:27.688
         [farting noise]        

01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:29.890
    - Do you want my opinion?   

01:25:29.892 --> 01:25:31.492
      You have one option.      

01:25:31.494 --> 01:25:33.560
          Deal with me.         

01:25:33.562 --> 01:25:35.229
    There is no other choice.   

01:25:35.231 --> 01:25:37.231
    Deal with me or run away.   

01:25:37.233 --> 01:25:40.167
    Besides, isn't that what    
       family's all about?      

01:25:40.169 --> 01:25:42.769
         Love. Hmm. Hey.        

01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:44.404
     - How could I love you?    

01:25:45.207 --> 01:25:47.407
       - You are a fucking      
          talking boil.         

01:25:47.409 --> 01:25:52.546
  - Well why don't you start by 
 taking off those crumbly pants.

01:25:53.883 --> 01:25:56.150
 - Just, just do it. Just do it.

01:26:07.163 --> 01:26:08.262
             [fart]             

01:26:10.933 --> 01:26:12.900
      - ohhh, come closer.      

01:26:15.404 --> 01:26:16.737
          - It's okay.          

01:26:16.739 --> 01:26:18.639
     It doesn't have teeth.     

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:24.378
          - Ohh, yeah.          

01:26:25.548 --> 01:26:27.214
         Feed it to me.         

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.349
              - Oh.             

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.346
             [fart]             

01:27:01.684 --> 01:27:02.916
          - Oh my god.          

01:27:02.918 --> 01:27:04.851
    That was so fucking good.   

01:27:06.956 --> 01:27:09.723
  You both feel so good. Ohhh!  

01:27:12.494 --> 01:27:13.727
        - Oh, that's it.        

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:14.895
           That's it.           

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:16.396
        That's the place.       

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:18.765
     [moaning and screaming]    

01:27:38.687 --> 01:27:40.954
    - Ohh, what a huge load.    

01:27:40.956 --> 01:27:43.423
    I love the taste of you.    

01:27:45.027 --> 01:27:48.028
      I knew this was going     
    to be fucking fantastic.    

01:27:54.336 --> 01:27:56.270
         - So now what?         

01:27:56.272 --> 01:28:00.774
     - Well, might be polite    
       to give me a name.       

01:28:02.011 --> 01:28:05.579
    Can't say I'm too fond of   
   being referred to as, "it".  

01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:13.820
    - Well, He's got a point.   

01:28:15.858 --> 01:28:19.293
       - I think I'm going      
       to call you, Royal.      

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:23.563
         - Royal the...         

01:28:23.565 --> 01:28:24.665
          - I love it.          

01:28:25.968 --> 01:28:27.034
             - Okay.            

01:28:52.361 --> 01:28:54.728
   - Mr. Quiggle, Mr. Quiggle.  

01:28:56.398 --> 01:28:57.597
          Mr. Quiggle.          

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.701
   Mr. Quiggle. Come on. Yeah.  

01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:01.835
          Mr. Quiggle.          

01:29:02.971 --> 01:29:04.438
          Mr. Quiggle.          

01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:06.773
          Mr. Quiggle.          

01:29:06.775 --> 01:29:08.475
    Let me come talk to you.    
          Mr. Quiggle.          

01:29:09.478 --> 01:29:10.444
    Let me come talk to you.    

01:29:10.446 --> 01:29:11.611
          Mr. Quiggle.          

01:29:11.613 --> 01:29:12.546
    Let me come talk to you.    

01:29:12.548 --> 01:29:13.447
            Quiggle.            

01:29:13.449 --> 01:29:14.781
    Let me come talk to you.    

01:29:14.783 --> 01:29:16.950
 Quiggle, come on, out that ass.

01:29:16.952 --> 01:29:19.386
Quiggle come and talk real fast.

01:29:19.388 --> 01:29:20.954
   Quiggle, yeah, talk real...  

01:30:32.895 --> 01:30:35.195
    - You had forgotten that    
   you had killed us already.   

01:30:35.197 --> 01:30:37.063
       You had forgotten.       

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:41.201
   You forgot about the fatal   
 death blow dealt to the temple 

01:30:41.203 --> 01:30:43.437
      from centuries past.      

01:30:44.039 --> 01:30:49.843
  Or the horse kick to his face 
which left him disfigured and   

01:30:49.845 --> 01:30:52.746
       loaded with a life       
         full of misery.        

01:30:54.583 --> 01:30:58.885
  Or the real estate wars that  
left us displaced, dispossessed,

01:30:58.887 --> 01:31:00.454
    making homes to the west.   

01:31:00.456 --> 01:31:03.623
     Shimmied for silver and    
   programmed for views as if   

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:07.194
   realities and eternities is  
 filler and you romance for gold

01:31:07.196 --> 01:31:11.131
      and shoes and a shot      
        at the big time.        

01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:12.699
             Shots!             

01:31:12.701 --> 01:31:15.902
  For Brad there was shot to a  
 head over a shot of wheat grass

01:31:15.904 --> 01:31:18.038
 so father wouldn't have prayed 
 cause nowhere to hide for your 

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:19.673
            weak gas.           

01:31:19.675 --> 01:31:22.509
       You are soup stock       
       for the immortals.       

01:31:22.511 --> 01:31:24.744
 Grinded in the student morgue. 

01:31:24.746 --> 01:31:28.949
     A lung full of ash and     
    a dream full of falling.    

01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:32.586
      A concept of death so     
 pronounced that the live is to 

01:31:32.588 --> 01:31:35.222
        be in a dream. An       
     unbelievable dreamscape    

01:31:35.224 --> 01:31:38.592
        for the tortured        
      souls that have fall.     

01:31:39.761 --> 01:31:41.928
         Fixed points in        
       the paying charts.       

01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:44.030
 Registry is for the euthanized.

01:31:45.133 --> 01:31:47.667
   So what can I make of this   
   twenty first century power   

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:50.070
 structure with this end result.

01:31:51.073 --> 01:31:53.940
 What can I make of this mac and
   cheese, corn bread, collard  

01:31:53.942 --> 01:31:57.143
 greens and my mother's sense of
   humour with this dead bolt,  

01:31:57.145 --> 01:31:59.880
      with this dead bolt,      
      with this dead bolt.      

01:32:02.551 --> 01:32:05.652
       With this lock out       
    space for funeral music.    

01:32:05.654 --> 01:32:07.087
   With this sheet of screams.  

01:32:07.089 --> 01:32:10.156
  With this unbelievable place  
    that you can't really be.   

01:32:10.158 --> 01:32:13.226
 With this un-prevalent feeling 
 that can't really be repaired. 

01:32:13.228 --> 01:32:14.694
        To which nothing        
        can be compared.        

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:16.296
        To be compared is       
         to be impaired.        

01:32:16.298 --> 01:32:17.597
        To be compared is       
         to be impaired.        

01:32:17.599 --> 01:32:19.266
        To be compared is       
        to be impaired...       

01:32:19.268 --> 01:32:21.735
        [unclear lyrics]        

01:32:22.771 --> 01:32:24.070
            Driven by           
   an exact sense of no where.  

01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:30.243
      Sense of no where on      
      Crenshaw and Stocker.     

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:33.880
    Pop locker is channelled    
    in energy from a Shawgra.   

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:36.049
        Straight from the       
     instilled anti-genius.     

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:37.984
       But it's too late!       

01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:40.020
     Death is on your hell.     

01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:45.859
  Behind your undoing, winding  
   along side your storyline.   

01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:50.664
        Shouting you out        
       in the liner notes.      

01:32:50.666 --> 01:32:54.100
   D-M and you from the great   
beyond, leaping from the coat of

01:32:54.102 --> 01:32:57.037
 invisibility into your lap and 
   climbing down your throat.   

01:32:58.807 --> 01:33:00.240
        So skin me alive.       

01:33:01.076 --> 01:33:03.176
      I survived and I can      
       barely believe it.       

01:33:04.046 --> 01:33:05.211
           The quake.           

01:33:08.183 --> 01:33:09.916
           The quake.           

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.353
         Skin me alive.         

01:33:14.623 --> 01:33:16.690
      I survived and I can      
       barely believe it.       

01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:19.926
           The quake.
