WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.771
MITCH: A year ago,
the animals started acting strangely,

00:03.804 --> 00:04.705
but no one noticed...

00:04.738 --> 00:05.439
(growling)

00:05.473 --> 00:06.674
until they began attacking,

00:06.707 --> 00:08.442
coordinating,

00:08.476 --> 00:09.477
evolving.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.345
The animals were mutating,

00:11.379 --> 00:13.190
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.082
(screams)

00:14.115 --> 00:16.484
The government came
up with a plan.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.594
PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:17.618 --> 00:18.686
in six to ten years

00:18.719 --> 00:20.321
the world's animal population

00:20.354 --> 00:22.623
will be thriving once again.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.558
Killing the animals?
Play God and repopulate

00:24.592 --> 00:25.693
the planet?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.128
This is ridiculous.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.662
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.696 --> 00:30.464
could be catastrophic.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.401
So a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.469
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:35.503 --> 00:37.071
animal experts.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.339
Chloe Tousignant,

00:38.372 --> 00:39.607
an intel operative.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.375
Jamie Campbell,

00:41.409 --> 00:43.111
a reporter who's been

00:43.144 --> 00:44.154
following this story, found me,

00:44.178 --> 00:45.379
Mitch Morgan,

00:45.413 --> 00:47.348
a veterinary pathologist.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.783
We thought all hope was lost

00:49.817 --> 00:51.485
when the key to our cure

00:51.519 --> 00:52.453
crashed and burned...

00:52.486 --> 00:53.354
but we were wrong.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.089
I still have it.

00:55.123 --> 00:56.400
I have the leopard,
I have the cure.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.093
Now we just have to get to Jamie

00:59.127 --> 01:00.704
and the leopard,
but time is running out.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.795
(bats screeching)

01:06.400 --> 01:07.335
What's the plan?

01:07.368 --> 01:09.370
There's a boat that
will take us to Jamie.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.471
A boat?

01:10.504 --> 01:11.805
It'll take 18 hours or so,

01:11.839 --> 01:13.374
but, you know, air travel.

01:13.407 --> 01:18.512
Yeah, I'm okay not getting
on a plane for a while.

01:18.546 --> 01:19.647
Hey.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.515
What is that?

01:21.549 --> 01:22.650
You all right?

01:22.683 --> 01:24.218
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, it's nothing.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.553
It's a dog bite, it's fine.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.688
That needs to be cleaned up.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.257
It doesn't look too good.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.558
Will do.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.393
(elephant trumpets)

01:33.394 --> 01:35.696
What the hell?

01:35.729 --> 01:36.840
This doesn't look so
good, either.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.433
(roars)

01:42.503 --> 01:45.539
(growling)

01:46.707 --> 01:48.542
Any ideas?

01:48.576 --> 01:50.511
I'm open to suggestions.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.645
(growling)

01:51.679 --> 01:52.689
Yeah, man, get us out of here.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.814
Hold on.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.516
(tires screeching)

02:00.388 --> 02:01.388
Turn here!

02:02.590 --> 02:05.326
ABRAHAM: We need
to get to Jamie.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.427
And the cure.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.595
(Chloe shouts)

02:07.628 --> 02:09.297
(rhinoceros groans)

02:22.543 --> 02:23.577
We got to keep moving.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.779
If the harbor's
anything like this,

02:25.813 --> 02:26.856
the captain won't wait long.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.750
(elephant trumpets)

02:29.783 --> 02:30.818
Neither will they.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.191
Abe.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.859
Count to five, light me.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.594
What are you doing?

02:40.628 --> 02:42.596
I'm making a wall. Meet me at.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.707
Amelia's office, she'll get us

02:43.731 --> 02:44.765
another car.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.599
Are you out of your mind?

02:45.633 --> 02:47.535
Probably.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.612
(lion roars and
elephant trumpets)

02:48.636 --> 02:50.404
Oh, boy.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.648
Let's go. CHLOE: No!

03:00.681 --> 03:02.550
We can't just leave him.
He said he'll

03:02.583 --> 03:04.618
meet us at Amelia's
office and he will.

03:04.652 --> 03:05.185
No. He's an African

03:05.219 --> 03:05.886
safari guide; I like his

03:05.919 --> 03:07.187
chances way better than ours.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.742
(tiger roars)

03:29.743 --> 03:31.679
(growling)

03:35.048 --> 03:37.251
(bees buzzing)

03:38.819 --> 03:39.720
MITCH: Run, Chloe.

03:39.753 --> 03:40.721
Guys.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.556
ABRAHAM: Go, go, go!

03:45.759 --> 03:47.261
(baby crying)

03:47.295 --> 03:48.696
WOMAN: Help.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.731
Help!

03:51.799 --> 03:53.834
(baby crying)

03:53.867 --> 03:54.935
Save my baby.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.605
Please help.

03:57.638 --> 03:58.639
Take her.

03:58.672 --> 03:59.640
(baby crying)

03:59.673 --> 04:01.642
I got her.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.011
(baby crying)

04:08.749 --> 04:10.651
(people screaming)

04:10.684 --> 04:12.753
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:12.786 --> 04:13.954
(sirens wailing)

04:13.987 --> 04:14.998
MAN (over P.A.): New arrivals

04:15.022 --> 04:16.957
without family members...

04:16.990 --> 04:18.559
MITCH: Hey.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.329
Hey, uh, we're-we're
here to see Amelia Sage.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.006
And we're looking for Chloe
Tousignant and Jackson Oz.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.532
Have they checked in yet?

04:24.565 --> 04:26.300
Couldn't tell you, pal,
we're a little busy.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.301
(sighs)

04:27.335 --> 04:28.936
I can't see them anywhere.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.772
The National Guard struggles
to regain control of the city

04:31.805 --> 04:33.774
from the escaped zoo animals.

04:33.807 --> 04:38.479
The death toll continues to
rise with 362 known fatalities

04:38.512 --> 04:41.382
and thousands injured
in what many are calling

04:41.415 --> 04:42.483
the Day of the Beast.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.851
MITCH: Chloe!

04:43.884 --> 04:45.018
Hey.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.487
Where's Jackson?

04:46.520 --> 04:47.488
We hoped he was here.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.589
Why do you have a baby?

04:48.622 --> 04:49.699
It happened after the hornets.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.859
A mother, she...

04:51.892 --> 04:53.661
sh-she, she didn't survive.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.563
That's terrible. MITCH: Yeah.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.665
This day's chock-full
of terrible.

04:57.698 --> 04:58.875
Hopefully Amelia can salvage it.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.368
Find us a way out of town.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.769
She hasn't

05:01.802 --> 05:03.671
checked in yet. Jackson!

05:04.705 --> 05:05.706
Hey.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.707
What happened to you?

05:06.740 --> 05:07.975
You okay?

05:08.008 --> 05:09.577
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.844
I'm fine.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.983
Rafiki, what happened out there?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.052
Brakes failed.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.053
I had to jump but

05:20.087 --> 05:21.889
fire did the trick.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.424
Scared all the animals away?

05:23.457 --> 05:24.492
Yeah, didn't see any

05:24.525 --> 05:25.926
after the explosion.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.495
(tiger roars)

05:27.528 --> 05:31.098
(tiger growling)

05:39.807 --> 05:42.676
(tiger sniffing)

05:54.655 --> 05:56.857
Got lucky, I guess.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.933
♪

06:42.670 --> 06:44.672
(growls)

06:45.739 --> 06:47.575
My friends are coming to get us.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.843
You have a very
important job to do.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.178
(speaks Inuttitut)

06:51.211 --> 06:52.680
(laughs)

06:52.713 --> 06:54.081
You know, they are going

06:54.114 --> 06:56.049
to write books about
you, the man who saved

06:56.083 --> 06:57.685
the leopard who saved the world.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.952
I'm going to

06:58.986 --> 07:00.621
make sure that
they're translated.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.122
Nawok.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.557
Nawok?

07:03.591 --> 07:05.626
That's... uh, rope?

07:05.659 --> 07:08.629
(chuckles)

07:13.133 --> 07:14.802
(leopard growling)

07:14.835 --> 07:16.570
Hey.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.739
What is it?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.941
(whining)

07:20.974 --> 07:22.743
(screeches)

07:22.776 --> 07:26.614
Hey, there, little, uh...

07:26.647 --> 07:28.716
little gremlin guy.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.652
(chattering)

07:31.685 --> 07:34.655
How'd you get in here?

07:35.923 --> 07:37.758
(bear roaring)

07:37.791 --> 07:39.026
(Jamie shouts)

07:40.093 --> 07:41.829
(wolves growling)

07:44.765 --> 07:46.466
(bear roars)

07:52.840 --> 07:54.942
(growls)

08:04.718 --> 08:06.754
(wolves growling)

08:18.766 --> 08:20.568
(whines)

08:20.601 --> 08:21.911
WOMAN: You've lost
a lot of blood.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.037
Well,
then why are you taking more?

08:24.071 --> 08:25.773
Typing and crossing. All right.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.274
You may need a transfusion.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.275
I'm fine. Hey,

08:28.308 --> 08:29.977
she's just trying to help.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.746
I will save you the trouble.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.015
O-negative,
I'm a universal donor.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.059
Still got to check, handsome.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.193
You got banged up pretty good.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.186
May have internal bleeding.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.187
And what about

08:40.220 --> 08:41.621
his bite?

08:41.655 --> 08:42.623
Keep it clean.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.256
Watch for infection, and

08:44.291 --> 08:46.035
if you're wondering,
just like everyone else,

08:46.059 --> 08:47.671
the animals can't pass
the virus on to humans.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.196
It's not a virus.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.899
Whatever it is,
it's not contagious.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.036
You could have been killed.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.638
I wasn't, okay?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.006
And I'm not waiting around

08:59.039 --> 09:00.808
for some ridiculous
blood results.

09:00.841 --> 09:01.809
I'm fine.

09:01.842 --> 09:02.810
You're not fine.

09:02.843 --> 09:03.977
None of this is fine.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.713
Chloe, I'm okay.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.513
Everything's okay.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.048
Tell that to the
mother of this child

09:08.081 --> 09:09.316
or anyone else who died today.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.151
The sooner we get out of here,

09:11.184 --> 09:13.329
the sooner that we can get to
the leopard and find the cure,

09:13.353 --> 09:14.655
and everything will be okay.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.956
Yes, and what if it isn't?

09:15.989 --> 09:18.158
The mutation has
spread to insects.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.660
They were the dispersal method.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.070
Yeah, well,
that's still our best chance.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.330
It's time for a solution
we know will work.

09:26.066 --> 09:30.137
There are over 42 million
species of animal.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.672
Wreaking havoc on the world.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.182
So, you're in favor
of the Noah Objective

09:33.206 --> 09:34.675
now, huh? You want to

09:34.708 --> 09:35.843
call all the animals,

09:35.876 --> 09:37.878
exterminate them,
and then repopulate.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.313
If it means saving lives.
It is straight up murder.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.925
And what do you call what
happened to this child's mother?

09:41.949 --> 09:43.250
I call it terrible. Huh?

09:43.283 --> 09:44.718
It's terrible.

09:44.752 --> 09:45.795
After everything
we've been through,

09:45.819 --> 09:47.387
wasn't there a moment when

09:47.420 --> 09:49.733
you felt that putting a bullet
in them was the right thing?

09:49.757 --> 09:52.693
MITCH: Hey, Danny and Sandy.

09:52.726 --> 09:56.029
We finally got somebody from
Amelia's office to talk to us.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.369
Guys, this is Eleanor Lewis.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.204
She's with IADG.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.873
Okay. Where's Amelia?

10:05.906 --> 10:08.208
Her motorcade was attacked.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.777
There were no survivors.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.879
It's not just here.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.213
The animals have attacked

10:13.246 --> 10:15.916
Berlin, Moscow,
Paris, Hong Kong...

10:15.949 --> 10:17.885
MITCH: Not to make
bad news worse,

10:17.918 --> 10:21.889
but the mutation has
jumped to the insects.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.432
The mosquitoes might not be
able to distribute the cure.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.134
MITCH: It's worse than that.
What do you mean?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.227
There are five species

10:27.260 --> 10:29.096
known to be essential
to human survival:

10:29.129 --> 10:33.667
bees, bats, butterflies,
primates and plankton.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.435
We've already lost
bats and primates.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.313
MITCH: Without the insects,
the only thing we have left

10:37.337 --> 10:40.107
on our side is the oh-so-useful
plankton we're losing.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.909
Our only shot is the leopards.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.153
Can you get us another car so
we can make it to the boat?

10:44.177 --> 10:46.213
Okay, that won't be necessary.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.691
I'm sending choppers and
a team to New Brunswick

10:47.715 --> 10:49.817
to get Ms.
Campbell and the cure.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.384
I want to see.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.688
This is a military
operation, Dr. Morgan.

10:54.722 --> 10:55.889
No, you need a vet on board.

10:55.923 --> 10:56.957
The cure's in a leopard.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.927
Leopards have a very high
sensitivity to sound.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.128
A chopper's kind of loud.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.130
So if that animal is
not sedated properly...

11:03.163 --> 11:05.132
I'm talking .2
milligrams of diazepam

11:05.165 --> 11:07.968
too much or too little...
Then your cure is gonna

11:08.001 --> 11:10.403
wake up and chew somebody's
face off or they're gonna...

11:10.437 --> 11:12.472
Oh, go no further. I get it.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.342
Why do I get the sense your
passion goes past the leopard?

11:17.878 --> 11:19.022
By the way,
I'm on that chopper, too.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.914
If he goes, I go.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.851
Well,
I suppose you want on as well?

11:23.884 --> 11:25.228
I want to get this
child to its father.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.755
ABRAHAM: I think I
can help with that.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.757
You pulled her from
an urban transport.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.925
I think I can call the
station to find out

11:31.959 --> 11:33.502
where the mother and
infant were picked up.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.362
Thank you.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.203
Bring Jamie home safe.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.942
(indistinct radio chatter)

11:48.976 --> 11:51.244
President just declared
a state of emergency.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.880
He's starting
mandatory evacuations

11:52.913 --> 11:53.914
all across New England.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.482
Mandatory evacuations?

11:55.515 --> 11:57.217
But where will everybody go?

11:57.250 --> 11:59.386
Apparently the government's
setting up safe zones...

11:59.419 --> 12:01.955
Albany, Dover, Portland.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.056
Chopper's on its way.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.467
Did you install those
titanium clamps I asked for

12:04.491 --> 12:05.458
to secure the crate?

12:05.492 --> 12:07.394
Yes, sir.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.806
So you're the ones who figured
out why the animals went crazy.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.531
That would be us.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.934
Didn't think you
guys really existed.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.468
Thought you were
some urban myth.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.282
So what happens when
we get this leopard?

12:19.306 --> 12:23.143
We use its DNA to make a
cure, fix the animals.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.245
Just like that... wow.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.455
It's an honor to
serve alongside you.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.816
Oh, the honor is all ours.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.226
Well, we're still one
leopard short of a cure,

12:30.250 --> 12:31.952
so let's keep the champagne on
ice, okay?

12:31.985 --> 12:33.153
Copy that.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.297
We'll have you in the
air in two minutes.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.223
Wait here.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.166
After everything
we've been through,

12:46.199 --> 12:47.410
we're finally going to do this.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.370
We're going to get a cure.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.274
And Jamie.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.310
It's going to be okay.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.345
(growling)

12:58.378 --> 12:59.512
(rumbling and crashing)

12:59.546 --> 13:00.914
It's okay.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.517

13:06.987 --> 13:09.056
(glass breaking)

13:09.089 --> 13:10.323
(whining)

13:14.394 --> 13:17.330
Just... just stay here.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.366
They're coming for you.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.301
You'll be safe here.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.371
(crunching and crashing)

13:24.404 --> 13:26.239
(barking)

13:32.279 --> 13:35.248
(indistinct radio chatter)

13:35.282 --> 13:38.385
15 minutes out from the
coordinates you gave us.

13:38.418 --> 13:42.255

13:42.289 --> 13:45.625

14:48.688 --> 14:50.490
Tranqs ready. No live rounds.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.266
Jamie!

15:35.168 --> 15:37.037
They found a body, male.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.338
No sign of the leopard.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.449
(indistinct yelling)

15:50.450 --> 15:52.519

MITCH: What?
(indistinct yelling)

15:55.788 --> 15:57.390
You got him?

15:57.424 --> 15:59.092
We have eyes on the target.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.162
SEAL: Any sign of the girl?

16:02.195 --> 16:03.630
SEAL 2: Negative!

16:05.665 --> 16:08.301
Jamie did this.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.536
Yes, Mitch.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.471
She was here.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.474
She was right here.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.742
Jamie!

16:17.410 --> 16:19.112

No, no, there's a woman here.

SEAL: We've got to go.
There's a woman here.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.026
Let's roll.

Jamie!

16:39.599 --> 16:41.168
We have to go.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.203
We have to go.
I am not leaving her here.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.537
She left that rope.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.806
That means she's still
alive, okay?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.118
She left the rope so we could
find the leopard, and we did.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.353
MITCH: We can't leave her here, okay?
ABRAHAM: We can come back

16:50.377 --> 16:51.478
and find Jamie. No, no, no.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.213
No. I'm not... I'm not leaving.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.547
I'm not leaving.

16:54.581 --> 16:55.515
What the hell are you doing?

16:55.548 --> 16:57.584
I'm not leaving without you.
I'm not leaving.

You were born O-negative.

Dog seems to disagree.

Well, obviously not.

You don't have clearance...

22:09.962 --> 22:10.930
around the world
for that leopard

22:10.963 --> 22:12.641

We will not find another way!

23:33.513 --> 23:35.147
We will not find another way.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.985
This... is over.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.620
I'm done.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.555
(dog barking)

23:52.264 --> 23:54.242
ELEANOR: Believe me,
I'm just as disappointed as you are.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.835
Whatever was in the leopard

23:55.868 --> 23:57.870
when it cured the dog
in Zambia is gone.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.072
We're starting from scratch.
It's still there. Okay?

24:00.106 --> 24:03.009
The-the leopard, the cure,
was isolated for three months,

24:03.042 --> 24:04.052
showed no signs
of contamination.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.512
The cure didn't change.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.846
Then why didn't it work?

24:06.879 --> 24:08.180
I stayed down
there with the dog,

24:08.214 --> 24:09.749
looked through everything:

24:09.782 --> 24:12.184
the cure did not change.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.086
I believe the animals did.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.689
The mutation in the animals
has moved past the Mother Cell.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.525
I'm afraid that
we were too late.

24:18.558 --> 24:19.892
I think that the mutation

24:19.926 --> 24:21.861
is still mutating.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.963
Assuming you're right,
what is it you're asking for?

24:23.996 --> 24:25.532
More time.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.934
Okay, time is something
we have fairly little of.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.937
Amelia and I are...
were some of the last IADG members

24:30.970 --> 24:33.906
looking for a non-lethal
solution to the animal problem.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.642
After today's attacks,

24:35.675 --> 24:37.944
the Noah Objective
seems unstoppable.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.812
Well, we found a solution once,

24:39.846 --> 24:41.280
we can do it again.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.982
Eleanor...

24:44.951 --> 24:46.653
We will do everything we can

24:46.686 --> 24:47.887
to get ahead of this thing.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.522
All right? That dog...

24:49.556 --> 24:50.799
Probably all the
animals out there...

24:50.823 --> 24:52.191
Are still changing.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.894
Everything that we
have seen so far

24:54.927 --> 24:57.063
could just be the beginning.
I've heard this before.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.631
What do you mean?

24:58.665 --> 25:00.032
Dr. Mark Vickers.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.534
Another scientist
I'm working with.

25:01.568 --> 25:02.835
How did he put it?

25:04.070 --> 25:06.639
"The initial mutation
is just the preamble.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.675
The main event is coming."

25:10.042 --> 25:11.310
We need to talk to him.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.212
He's on a research
mission in Argentina

25:13.245 --> 25:15.715
with a team of Army Rangers,
searching for an animal

25:15.748 --> 25:17.617
with what he calls a
"phase two mutation."

25:19.686 --> 25:22.121
Then Argentina is our next stop.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.156
(birds squawking)

25:27.059 --> 25:29.095
Abby? No.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.598
Sarah? No.

25:31.631 --> 25:32.999
Michelle?

25:33.032 --> 25:35.001
Mary? Miranda?

25:35.034 --> 25:37.036
Nope, nope, no.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.938
You want to take a guess,
there, Dr. Vickers?

25:38.971 --> 25:40.640
What are we guessing?

25:40.673 --> 25:42.942
Ward's wife is nine
months pregnant.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.620
It's a girl,
but he won't tell us the name.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.145
Well, it's your guess.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.980
I've been friends
with Ward since Basic.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.683
I don't need a guess; I know.
Oh, so he told you.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.919
I didn't tell her zip.
She just thinks she knows.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.622
Oh, I know!
What's the name, then?

25:55.655 --> 25:58.124
My boy here's obsessed with
all things Harry Potter,

25:58.157 --> 26:00.627
so I'm gonna go with Hermione!

26:00.660 --> 26:02.128
Is she right, Ward?

26:02.161 --> 26:04.096
Like I said,
I didn't tell her zip.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.599
Hermione. Damn old lady name.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.167
I know what I know.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.691
Clear the area.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.337
RANGER 1: Check the river.
RANGER 2: On it.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.063
The animal we're
tracking did this?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.097
It would appear that way,

26:38.130 --> 26:39.298
but just to be sure...

26:40.432 --> 26:41.634
RANGER 1: Get that side.

26:41.668 --> 26:42.669
RANGER 2: Eyes out.

26:43.736 --> 26:46.005
RANGER 1: Clear.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.687
Yes.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.089
An animal with a phase two

27:03.122 --> 27:05.725
mutation inflicted these wounds.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.393
We're switching to live ammo.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.962
Whatever did this isn't
going down with tranqs.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.073
What? No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.099
Absolutely not.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.667
This-this creature is the key.

27:14.701 --> 27:17.403
It's the pivotal link in the
next phase of the mutation.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.071
It must be captured alive.

27:19.105 --> 27:22.108
The tranquilizers
will take it down.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.044
You have orders.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.312
Yeah, to keep you alive.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.313
No, to help me

27:27.346 --> 27:28.881
capture this creature.

27:32.251 --> 27:35.121
Or do I need to call Washington?

27:36.956 --> 27:38.124
Stay with tranqs.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.693
Keep your sidearms close.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.228
RANGER 1: Staying with tranqs.

27:42.261 --> 27:42.929
RANGER 2: Roger that,
staying with tranqs.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.197
TEAM LEADER: Let's move out.

27:59.145 --> 28:02.214
ABRAHAM: We pushed our luck already
with the trip to New Brunswick.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.917
The friendly skies haven't
been so friendly to us.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.185
Hey, don't worry.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.329
Apparently,
according to Eleanor,

28:07.353 --> 28:08.487
this plane has been equipped

28:08.520 --> 28:10.256
with some sort of
countermeasures.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.257
So, they're going to try and

28:11.290 --> 28:14.260
squeeze us into a fighter jet.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.433
Looks like the skies just
got a whole lot friendlier.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.271
(Abraham laughs)

28:30.409 --> 28:32.211
This is your pilot,

28:32.244 --> 28:33.980
Greg Trotter.
Greg, this is Jackson Oz...

28:34.013 --> 28:35.281
Hey. Welcome.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.883
Abraham Kenyatta...
Hi, how are you?

28:36.916 --> 28:38.284
And Chloe Tousignant. Hi.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.452
Well, nice meeting y'all.

28:40.486 --> 28:41.888
I'm off to do preflight.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.155
Be in the air in no time.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.424
Enjoy your tour.

28:45.457 --> 28:48.194
The sleeping quarters and
the lounge are upstairs.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.129
You'll have to decide
amongst yourselves

28:50.162 --> 28:52.198
who gets the master bedroom.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.869
This kitchen is bigger than

28:56.903 --> 28:59.138
my first apartment.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.908
Vehicle bay is in the
tail and this is the lab.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.310
JACKSON: Eleanor...

29:04.343 --> 29:06.078
whose plane is this?

29:06.112 --> 29:09.048
An interested third party
who has a lot to lose

29:09.081 --> 29:10.883
if the Noah Objective
goes forward.

29:10.917 --> 29:14.153
And this third party is giving
us a ride to meet a scientist?

29:14.186 --> 29:15.826
Not giving you a ride,
giving you a plane.

29:16.522 --> 29:17.489
What's the catch?

29:17.523 --> 29:18.490
MITCH: No catch.

29:18.524 --> 29:19.525
Hey.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.027
That was the first question

29:21.060 --> 29:23.095
I asked, too.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.297
I also asked for

29:25.331 --> 29:28.067
a basketball hoop
right up there.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.078
Guess we haven't gotten
around to that one yet, huh?

29:30.102 --> 29:31.170
So, you're back?

29:31.203 --> 29:32.471
I thought you quit.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.384
Well, to be honest,
I got no place else to go...

29:35.574 --> 29:38.244
and I made a deal

29:38.277 --> 29:40.212
with our new pal, Eleanor, here.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.581
She's gonna send a
team to look for Jamie,

29:42.614 --> 29:44.917
and if they can't find her,
she's gonna send another

29:44.951 --> 29:47.486
and another and another
until we do find her.

29:47.519 --> 29:48.487
Right, Eleanor?

29:48.520 --> 29:49.555
As soon as a team

29:49.588 --> 29:51.090
becomes available,

29:51.123 --> 29:52.200
I'll dispatch them
to New Brunswick.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.592
Eleanor,

29:53.625 --> 29:55.394
thank you, truly.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.229
It's the least I can do.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.331
And thank you for
using your leverage.

29:59.365 --> 30:03.502
All right,
if I won all of you in a raffle,

30:03.535 --> 30:07.073
I'd probably give you back to
the guy who won second place.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.383
Although he probably
wouldn't want you, either.

30:08.407 --> 30:11.243
Nor would he want me,

30:11.277 --> 30:14.513
because I've been behaving
like a five-year-old.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.586
(clears throat) As to why
we're all being raffled off

30:16.615 --> 30:18.217
in the first place,
I can't really...

30:18.250 --> 30:19.551
Look, I'm...

30:19.585 --> 30:21.253
What I'm trying to say is

30:21.287 --> 30:23.555
we don't get to
choose our families.

30:23.589 --> 30:25.591
For better, for worse,

30:25.624 --> 30:27.626
we're pretty much family now.

30:27.659 --> 30:31.263
Right?

30:31.297 --> 30:33.565
We've got work to
do, so let's do it.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.568
JACKSON: And what is

30:36.602 --> 30:39.171
that work, Eleanor?

30:39.205 --> 30:40.539
Do we have an
official assignment?

30:40.572 --> 30:41.908
Stop the mutation.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.309
ABRAHAM: Oh.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.977
That's all.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.378
ELEANOR: Thanks to

30:46.412 --> 30:48.347
aggressive lobbying
by Reiden Global,

30:48.380 --> 30:51.918
the IADG is set to vote on the
Noah Objective in six weeks.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.386
If it's approved,
there will be no turning back.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.355
MITCH: Hang on a second.
Reiden Global?

30:56.388 --> 30:59.258
The biotech company that started
this whole animal mess...

30:59.291 --> 31:00.626
They still have a say in this?

31:00.659 --> 31:02.995
They offered a solution,
and people are listening.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.396
JACKSON: The Noah Objective

31:04.430 --> 31:06.398
is not a solution.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.400
It's murder. ELEANOR: We're part

31:08.434 --> 31:11.070
of a dwindling few who believe that.
The only way

31:11.103 --> 31:12.314
we're gonna convince
the others is

31:12.338 --> 31:14.006
by giving them a
viable alternative.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.574
Start in Argentina.

31:15.607 --> 31:19.111
Meet with Dr. Vickers, see if his work...
if this animal

31:19.145 --> 31:20.379
he's hunting can help you.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.448
We don't have much time.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.320
(rolling thunder)

31:30.422 --> 31:32.424
Come on in.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.028
It's clear.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.097
We're good to go.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.565
Okay, we'll bunk here tonight.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.134
Oh, wait. Look, we're so close.

31:42.168 --> 31:44.136
Trail's washed away.
Tracker's on the fritz.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.405
We'll leave at 0500.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.440
Ward, you got first watch.

31:48.474 --> 31:51.077
(thunder cracking)

31:56.215 --> 31:58.384
(indistinct chatter)

32:04.656 --> 32:07.593
MAN (on TV): We now have
confirmation from the IADG that

32:07.626 --> 32:09.495
the rumored cure has failed.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.530
And in light of the
attacks in Washington D.C.,

32:11.563 --> 32:15.167
suburbs all along the Eastern
Seaboard are being evacuated.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.336
Residents are encouraged
to take shelter

32:17.369 --> 32:20.372
in the nearest protected
city or government safe zone.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.674
I have the feeling things
are going to get worse

32:22.708 --> 32:24.410
before they get better.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.645
I need a drink.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.726
We got to the safe
zone a few hours ago.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.229
But there's a long
line for the computers.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.097
And the food.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.498
And showers.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.334
There's so many people here.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.536
And they all seem... angry.

32:50.569 --> 32:53.605
Yeah, well,
people are scared, Clem.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.308
And they're frustrated.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.410
I'm just glad you're safe...
You and your mom.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.246
And... Justin.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.148
How you feeling?

33:02.181 --> 33:04.483
I'm fine.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.153
They took Henry.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.720
Who did?

33:08.754 --> 33:12.191
The people here... in charge.

33:12.224 --> 33:16.162
They put him in the quarantine
with the other pets.

33:16.195 --> 33:20.532
Well, I'm sure they'll take good
care of him, okay? Don't worry.

33:20.566 --> 33:24.170
Do you think they'll
let me visit him?

33:26.138 --> 33:28.640
I don't think that's a good
idea, kiddo.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.510
Henry's going to be fine.

33:31.543 --> 33:34.012
Okay?

33:35.247 --> 33:36.748
Dad...

33:36.782 --> 33:38.717
when's this going to be over?

33:40.186 --> 33:42.488
Soon.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.391
How do you know?

33:45.424 --> 33:50.496
I know because I'm the one
who's gonna make it over.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.598
Here, check... check this out.

33:52.631 --> 33:55.367
Look at this.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.568
Oh.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.604
See all that?

33:58.637 --> 34:00.539
Would you believe
me if I told you

34:00.572 --> 34:02.541
I'm on an airplane right now?

34:02.574 --> 34:03.709
(laughing): Whoa.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.278
No way. Way.

34:06.312 --> 34:08.547
And I've got
everything I need here

34:08.580 --> 34:10.581
to, uh... to fix the animals.

34:10.616 --> 34:13.385
So you don't have to
worry about anything

34:13.418 --> 34:18.657
except for staying safe
and staying healthy, okay?

34:19.658 --> 34:21.260
Okay.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.161
I love you.

34:24.429 --> 34:26.598
I love you, too.

34:41.880 --> 34:47.253
I pulled a few strings...
Slightly illegal strings...

34:47.286 --> 34:49.321
And I changed your
medical records.

34:49.355 --> 34:52.324
Well, then, uh...

34:52.358 --> 34:55.561
we got nothing to worry
about, huh?

34:55.594 --> 34:59.198
We don't have to worry about
anyone else finding out.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.633
We'll keep this
between the two of us.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.703
Our little secret.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.709
(rolling thunder)

35:12.711 --> 35:15.247
(thunderclaps)

35:15.281 --> 35:16.915
JACKSON: Our little secret

35:16.948 --> 35:19.285
that what?

35:19.318 --> 35:22.854
My blood's changing?

35:22.888 --> 35:25.724
(laughing): That I'm changing?

35:27.926 --> 35:30.529
Changing into what?

35:30.562 --> 35:33.632
(thunder rumbling)

35:48.847 --> 35:51.650
Yes,
that is our current position.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.819
Well, I look forward
to their arrival.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.854
Thank you, Ms. Lewis.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.523
A team is en route to join us.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.225
WARD: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:59.258 --> 36:00.692
That mean our tour's extended.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.770
Above your pay grade, Ward.
I need to be home when Hermione is born.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.430
Hermione?

36:04.463 --> 36:05.697
(all laughing) She was right.

36:05.731 --> 36:06.865
I know what I know.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.567
Whatever.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.602
I need to be there.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.371
Yeah, I understand.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.739
Completely.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.874
But if you want what is
best for your daughter,

36:15.907 --> 36:20.579
for your sons, your wives,
we need to stay here.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.648
If we don't succeed here,
you don't have families

36:22.681 --> 36:23.815
to go back to.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.660
Everything will be gone.
Life as we know it will change.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.620
I am talking about the
extinction of the human race.

36:28.654 --> 36:29.855
But we can stop it.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.857
Our work here will
make it so our children

36:31.890 --> 36:33.592
have a future.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.595
They will be able to...

36:36.628 --> 36:37.863
ride bikes and play baseball,

36:37.896 --> 36:40.732
hold our hands when
we cross the street.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.734
Look, we may not be
home, but I assure you,

36:42.768 --> 36:45.304
we are on the front
lines of their future.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.805
(Vickers groans)

36:46.838 --> 36:49.308
(men talking over each
other, cocking guns)

36:49.341 --> 36:50.776
How many?

36:50.809 --> 36:52.778
Six Rangers and Vickers.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.946
(alarm blaring) Where was
their last checkpoint?

36:54.980 --> 36:56.782
A hostel ten kilometers north.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.888
Okay. Follow us.

37:02.921 --> 37:05.457
No, follow us.

37:15.501 --> 37:16.901
TEAM LEADER: Romi,
Augie, flank 'em.

37:20.672 --> 37:21.773

37:21.807 --> 37:23.642
RANGER: Look out!

37:27.012 --> 37:28.447
They're fast.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.881
RANGER: Stay back!

37:29.915 --> 37:32.284
Keep your distance! (shrieks)

37:34.386 --> 37:35.687
RANGER: Hey, there!

37:37.756 --> 37:38.857
(grunts)

37:40.792 --> 37:42.861

38:02.614 --> 38:04.583

38:14.059 --> 38:15.894
This thing between you and Abe,

38:15.927 --> 38:17.396
you got to put it behind you.
