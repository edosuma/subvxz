06:24.952 --> 06:26.553
I thought you ghosted me.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.822
Chile, I'm the last ghost

06:28.856 --> 06:31.658
you need to be worried 'bout
up in this hure building.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.860
Ain't you s'posed
to be at home?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.428
Bitch, ain't that where I'm at?

06:34.461 --> 06:36.730
It ain't just yo' house,
heyell...

06:36.764 --> 06:40.134
I done spent waaay more nights
on them back couches than you.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.402
<i>I been making memories
at the knees of grownfolks</i>

06:42.436 --> 06:45.072
in this club
since I was yay high.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.143
I made so many memories chile,
I'on even need to dream.

06:50.477 --> 06:51.945
You ain't just
bought yo'self a club.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.949
You done bought yo'self
some history.

06:55.983 --> 06:59.052
Thass where
my great-grandaddy Honeycomb

06:59.086 --> 07:01.088
got shot over a craps game.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.923
And thass where <i>his</i> granddaddy, Clyde,

07:02.956 --> 07:04.725
would sit and drank a pint
of corn liquor

07:04.758 --> 07:07.427
after working the Kyle Fields
til midnight...

07:10.197 --> 07:11.632
And that stage right there,

07:11.665 --> 07:13.000
thass where
my Granmuva Ernestine

07:13.033 --> 07:14.501
would open up her mouth

07:14.535 --> 07:17.704
and let heaven and heyell
pour out on a Sat'day night.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.573
Hmph.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.043
Oh, this place is full of haints
and unsung melodies, chile...

07:23.076 --> 07:25.179
History is important, yes.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.916
But so's the future...

07:31.618 --> 07:33.453
Look-a here.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.155
We done been at each other's
throats for days now

07:35.189 --> 07:37.591
and it ain't done nobody
no bit of good.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.494
Cause I done run out of ideas
short of killing you.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.529
You wouldn't be the first
to try.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.132
That part.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.002
Only thing left to do
is to talk.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.173
Bawse bitch to bawse bitch.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.145
You ain't gone talk me out
of selling, Clifford.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.746
<i>I know
you thank this just some</i>

07:59.780 --> 08:02.015
<i>swamp land with a crumblin'
building on top of it.</i>

08:02.049 --> 08:04.585
But it's <i>all</i> I got.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.120
This the only thang
thass ever been given to me.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.957
I can build me
another shake junt.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.558
But I can't build me
no 'nother Pynk.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.960
I didn't save this place
off the auction block

08:12.993 --> 08:14.161
just to watch it go down
in flames.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.096
But we done brought it all
up to code,

08:16.129 --> 08:18.098
pussy plastic, hippo filters
and all!

08:18.131 --> 08:20.767
How much longer 'til
it's shut down again, huh?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.236
I mean, look at what just
happened to Ernestine--

08:22.269 --> 08:24.104
Bitch, you better keep
my Granmuva name

08:24.137 --> 08:25.205
outcho mu'fucking mouth!!

08:25.239 --> 08:26.840
Six feet!

08:26.874 --> 08:28.609
You've been in close contact,
correct?

08:30.811 --> 08:32.880
Look,
that referendum's gone pass

08:32.913 --> 08:34.882
and that casino's gone come.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.551
Me buying The Pynk was just
prolonging the inevitable.

08:37.584 --> 08:38.752
The best we can hope for

08:38.785 --> 08:40.687
is getting
what The Pynk's actually worth.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.523
And how, pray tell,
do you put a price

08:43.557 --> 08:45.259
on the land
my ancestors died?

08:45.292 --> 08:47.661
We can start with 5 million.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.898
That's what Promised Land
just offered me...

08:54.701 --> 08:56.870
- I'm not gonna take it tho--
- Bitch, whuh?!

08:58.238 --> 09:00.274
I mean, <i>good!</i>

09:00.307 --> 09:01.575
But also, bitch whuh?!

09:01.608 --> 09:03.243
Cause I want 10,

09:03.277 --> 09:06.546
point blank period.

09:06.580 --> 09:09.216
I'm gone get
what you deserve, Clifford.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.317
Your ancestors, too--

09:10.550 --> 09:12.052
Naw-naw-naw-naw naw-naw-naw

09:12.085 --> 09:13.220
what you not gone do

09:13.253 --> 09:15.255
is piss in my mouf
and call it Kool-Aid.

09:15.289 --> 09:18.558
This ain't 'bout me, chile,
or my ancestors.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.127
- This 'bout YOU--
- Naw!

09:20.160 --> 09:23.096
It's about the <i>money</i>
that saved this club.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.065
The <i>money</i> I lost
my daughter over.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.567
The <i>money</i> that was supposed
to give us a new life.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.236
<i>This may not
be my inheritance,</i>

09:29.269 --> 09:31.271
<i>but right now it's my dream.</i>

09:31.305 --> 09:34.341
And I'm not gonna
let it go to waste.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.777
I can't do that...

09:40.247 --> 09:41.882
Not to <i>her.</i>

09:45.185 --> 09:47.854
But Hailey...

09:50.724 --> 09:52.592

10:05.339 --> 10:06.873

10:06.907 --> 10:08.375

give you some time.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.911
<i>She done been

10:10.944 --> 10:13.914

So. What you finna do?

10:42.109 --> 10:45.178

on that racist-ass <i>Huck Finn.</i>

10:49.416 --> 10:51.084
Maybe we could
get our nails did?

10:51.118 --> 10:53.153
Or maybe I could paint my room.

10:53.186 --> 10:56.223
Now I know you know I ain't
talkin' 'bout no HGTV projects.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.026

21:27.887 --> 21:30.657

21:30.690 --> 21:34.027
It is... an option...
to consider.

Well, Jelissa said that Taylor said
that her mama said

21:36.362 --> 21:38.331

Ain't nobody get no cancer

21:54.013 --> 21:56.049
At the very least, get some

21:56.082 --> 21:57.550
Pre-natal vitamins?

21:57.583 --> 21:59.352
So you think
I should have the baby?

21:59.385 --> 22:00.453
Ain't nobody said that.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.788
So you think I shouldn't
have the baby?

22:01.821 --> 22:02.922

22:02.955 --> 22:04.791

Let me finish gettin'
my measurements.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.367

Right on the cusp.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.773

So you just gonna...

33:36.582 --> 33:38.384
suck it out?

33:38.417 --> 33:41.520
If that's what you decide.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.222
And you sure I won't
get cancer?

33:43.255 --> 33:46.158
No! Who said that?

33:46.191 --> 33:49.294
There are risks if you decide
to have an abortion.

33:49.328 --> 33:52.197
Bleeding, infection,
blood clots.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.599
But guess what.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.535
All of those risks are also
associated with childbirth.

Hm.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.076
She gotta choose right now?

38:04.616 --> 38:06.985

38:20.666 --> 38:23.869
Okay, thank about it like this

38:27.806 --> 38:29.608

38:29.641 --> 38:32.544
What does <i>Terricka</i> want

38:52.330 --> 38:53.932
Granmuva, they gon'

38:55.701 --> 38:58.637
I don't wanna die alone.

39:00.405 --> 39:01.773

39:09.347 --> 39:10.882

39:10.916 --> 39:12.517

39:12.551 --> 39:14.352
Say goodbye, Cliff.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.390
Mbye.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.727

39:29.101 --> 39:30.102
Let's go.

39:55.594 --> 39:58.430
Could we go by the outlets
while we out here?

39:58.463 --> 40:00.031
My good jeans a lil' too tight

40:00.065 --> 40:02.567
and they won't
button up no more.

40:02.601 --> 40:03.902
Cause yo' ass pregnant.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.839
Time's up, Tee!
You gone haveta tell me

40:07.873 --> 40:10.041
whatchu gone do
'bout this baby.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.576
I'on know.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.178
See?
Thass proof positive

40:13.411 --> 40:14.880
that yo' ass ain't ready
to be no mama.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.081
You the one to talk.

40:16.114 --> 40:17.115
Excuse me?

40:17.149 --> 40:18.850
You ain't got no right
to tell me

40:18.884 --> 40:20.819
if I'm ready
to be a mama or not

40:20.852 --> 40:22.654
when you were never a mama
to me.

40:22.687 --> 40:24.456
They wouldn't let me.

40:24.489 --> 40:27.025
Patrice, Shelle, the judge.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.561
So they the reason why you
missed all those visitations?

40:29.594 --> 40:31.163
They the reason
why you didn't come

40:31.196 --> 40:33.865
to my 7th birthday party
at the roller rink?

40:33.899 --> 40:38.470
If you knew the things
that I done done for you...

40:38.503 --> 40:40.172
to finally get that gym.

40:40.205 --> 40:43.041
Thass been the missing piece.

40:43.074 --> 40:45.877
I can finally prove that I ain't just
no hoe up on a pole.

40:49.848 --> 40:52.551
So why you still don't have me?

41:41.132 --> 41:44.669
Tee, I'm tryin'.

41:48.106 --> 41:52.043
You ain't never have
to prove nothing to me.

41:53.612 --> 41:56.047
I just needed you
to be my mama.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.085
Like I said,

42:00.118 --> 42:01.786
I been tryin'.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.054
<i>Well, it's too late.</i>

42:03.088 --> 42:06.591
<i>I'm having a fucking baby.</i>

42:06.625 --> 42:08.627
But it's all right.

42:09.995 --> 42:12.731
Cause I ain't gone
be like you or Shelle.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.834
I'm never gone
have my baby wondering

42:15.867 --> 42:19.204
if I wish I had an abortion.

42:19.237 --> 42:22.841
I ain't gone drink til I blackout
to forget she exists.

42:24.142 --> 42:26.011
You right, Tee.

42:26.044 --> 42:29.114
I fucked up.

42:29.147 --> 42:31.616
A lot.

42:34.019 --> 42:36.187
So...

42:38.823 --> 42:40.692
You did want an abortion?

42:40.725 --> 42:43.795
<i>I'd be lyin' if I said
I ain't never consider it.</i>

42:43.828 --> 42:46.698
<i>But that's all
I ever did was consider.</i>

42:46.731 --> 42:49.668
<i>Cause Patrice
ain't give me no choice.</i>

42:49.701 --> 42:52.637
She made me have you.

42:54.005 --> 42:55.974
And you know what?

42:57.609 --> 43:00.045
I'm thankful every day.

43:02.347 --> 43:05.083
Because sometimes
God uses the devil

43:05.116 --> 43:07.719
to give you yo' blessings.

43:07.752 --> 43:11.156
<i>All I ever wanted was for you
to have choices, Terricka.</i>

43:11.189 --> 43:13.158
<i>And to make 'em for yo'self.</i>

43:41.252 --> 43:45.357
Do you think anybody's
ever ready for this?

43:45.390 --> 43:47.025
No.

43:47.058 --> 43:49.260
We both know I wun't.

43:59.738 --> 44:02.407
We got a lotta lost time

<i>Do I know you?</i>

52:40.758 --> 52:42.593
I'm an old friend
of Keyshawn's.

52:44.428 --> 52:46.163
Derrick, thass Autumn.

52:47.532 --> 52:50.535
Me and her used to work
together at the club.

52:54.605 --> 52:55.773
Huh...

52:55.806 --> 52:58.175
Well, I was at the outlets
in Jackson,

52:58.209 --> 52:59.810
and I couldn't stop myself
from picking up

52:59.844 --> 53:01.946
a little something
for baby Regal.

53:04.749 --> 53:06.851
Aww.

53:06.884 --> 53:09.921
She knows she can't
sleep nowadays.

53:13.491 --> 53:15.459
Can I?

53:16.861 --> 53:18.262
Sure.

53:19.931 --> 53:21.465
Oh.

53:23.501 --> 53:25.236
Hi.

53:30.575 --> 53:32.944
I'm gonna tell you
a story, Regal.

53:32.977 --> 53:36.647
Once upon a time, there was
a little girl named Hailey

53:36.681 --> 53:38.950
who belonged to no one.

53:38.983 --> 53:41.419
Who never had her own home.

53:41.452 --> 53:44.789
And she walked
the deep, dark woods

53:44.822 --> 53:47.892
searching for shelter
from the constant storm.

53:47.925 --> 53:52.730
Until one day,
a baby fell out of the sky.

53:52.763 --> 53:56.434
And suddenly,
all her dreams came true.

53:56.467 --> 53:58.669
She had a family.

53:58.703 --> 54:01.973
And she swore she'd do anything
to protect it.

54:04.008 --> 54:06.477
But that's when
she met the Hunter.

54:06.510 --> 54:10.448
<i>And he built her
a three-story McMansion</i>

54:10.481 --> 54:12.416
<i>with marble counters</i>

54:12.450 --> 54:16.754
and kept her in gowns spun
with Yves Saint Laurent silk.

54:16.787 --> 54:19.824
Hailey thought she had
everything she ever wanted.

54:21.392 --> 54:23.027
But one night,

54:23.260 --> 54:26.530
<i>beneath the slanted light
of a crescent moon,</i>

54:26.564 --> 54:29.533
<i>she saw his teeth
were actually knives,</i>

54:29.567 --> 54:32.737
his eyes hungry, ears tuned

54:32.770 --> 54:36.340
to her truth and her lies.

54:36.374 --> 54:37.975
She was trapped.

54:38.009 --> 54:40.478
<i>But one thing
she carried with her</i>

54:40.511 --> 54:44.515
<i>were bags of plastic
filled with her tears.</i>

54:44.548 --> 54:46.417
<i>She poured them out,
making a river</i>

54:46.450 --> 54:48.586
that flooded the whole forest.

54:49.954 --> 54:52.289
She could swim.

54:52.323 --> 54:54.358
Her baby could not.

54:55.726 --> 54:59.697
Her tears drowned her baby.

54:59.730 --> 55:02.500
All because she waited
too long.

55:11.075 --> 55:13.744
Autumn,

55:13.778 --> 55:16.747
like...

55:16.781 --> 55:18.549
what are you talmbout?

55:36.367 --> 55:38.402
Mama.

55:38.436 --> 55:41.338
Look up Hailey Colton.

55:41.372 --> 55:43.374
And call me

55:43.407 --> 55:46.410
when you're ready
to learn how to swim.
