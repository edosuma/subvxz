It's the student hall.

00:18.329 --> 00:19.659
What's going on?

00:30.310 --> 00:31.310
He's dead.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.899
They died in a place\Nfilled with people,

01:01.770 --> 01:03.770
yet no one\Nhas seen the culprit.

01:04.108 --> 01:05.108
No.

01:05.869 --> 01:06.880
They've seen the culprit.

01:08.609 --> 01:10.610
These cameras\Nhave seen everything.

01:15.550 --> 01:17.119
He was sitting\Nnear the entrance...

01:17.520 --> 01:19.050
with six cameras\Npointed toward him.

01:19.050 --> 01:20.259
There can't be\Na blind spot.

01:20.759 --> 01:22.619
I'm sure the culprit\Ngot caught on the footage.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.690
Do you really think...

01:24.789 --> 01:26.860
all six cameras were\Nfilming the entrance?

01:26.899 --> 01:28.029
No, not that.

01:28.259 --> 01:29.500
A little on this side,

01:29.770 --> 01:31.669
a little from that side,\Nand from this side.

01:31.669 --> 01:33.100
All of them film\Na bit of the entrance.

01:33.899 --> 01:35.770
An experienced\Ndetective like me...

01:35.869 --> 01:37.369
can tell what\Nthese are filming...

01:37.369 --> 01:38.569
by looking\Nat their angles.

01:40.179 --> 01:42.809
Do you really think\Nthe culprit is on it?

01:43.449 --> 01:45.910
It didn't happen in\NGi Yong and In Ae's case.

01:45.910 --> 01:48.279
That place didn't have\Na lot of cameras.

01:49.380 --> 01:50.390
Don't worry.

01:50.390 --> 01:52.449
I'm sure the culprit\Ngot filmed on camera.

02:29.260 --> 02:32.390
I came to see\NMr. Hwang Jae Min.

02:32.460 --> 02:34.360
- Oh, really?\N- Yes.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.029
Okay.

02:43.839 --> 02:45.040
He's not picking up.

02:45.510 --> 02:47.140
You should call his cell.

02:49.580 --> 02:51.050
His cell?

02:51.849 --> 02:52.879
I do not...

02:53.820 --> 02:55.649
wish to hurt you.

02:56.490 --> 02:57.749
You can reach me...

02:58.089 --> 02:59.559
through my landline.

03:11.869 --> 03:12.869
Excuse me.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.679
You dropped this.

03:22.740 --> 03:23.909
Oh, goodness.

03:24.749 --> 03:25.849
Thank you.

03:26.050 --> 03:29.349
Are you here to see\NMr. Hwang of forensics?

03:29.349 --> 03:31.249
- Yes.\N- I'll show you the way.

03:31.249 --> 03:32.849
I was headed there too.

03:32.849 --> 03:34.820
I see. Thank you.

03:37.689 --> 03:38.960
- This way.\N- Okay.

03:42.129 --> 03:44.099
It's the room\Nat the end of this hall.

03:44.730 --> 03:48.170
Wait, did you come\Nall the way here for me?

03:48.839 --> 03:51.170
A policeman must be kind\Nand willing to serve.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.240
Excuse me.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.809
He has great manners.

03:57.679 --> 03:58.679
Right.

04:00.179 --> 04:02.020
Don't be too scared.

04:02.550 --> 04:04.219
I don't think...

04:04.219 --> 04:06.149
he beats up people.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.760
Right. Goodbye.

Hello, Professor Hwang.

04:28.940 --> 04:29.950
Welcome.

04:30.109 --> 04:31.279
Would you like\Na cup of tea?

04:32.109 --> 04:33.120
Sure.

04:35.979 --> 04:38.349
Mr. Gye.\NDo you want some tea?

04:38.520 --> 04:39.690
I'm okay.

04:40.419 --> 04:42.089
I'm glad.\NI was about to tell you...

04:42.089 --> 04:44.330
that we are\Ncompletely out of coffee.

04:47.460 --> 04:48.460
I see.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.570
I ordered a cup of coffee

04:54.640 --> 04:56.169

05:24.229 --> 05:26.299
But of course,\Neven a rough brush...

05:26.299 --> 05:28.370
would be\Nwilling to open up...

05:28.370 --> 05:30.109
with a lady's touch.

05:32.909 --> 05:34.140
Professor Hwang.

05:34.510 --> 05:36.609
You are very poetic.

05:37.549 --> 05:38.549
Am I?

05:42.719 --> 05:44.589
It's me, Kim Kyung Mi.

05:44.589 --> 05:46.359
I can humor anyone.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.960
Your shoe size is 245mm.

05:53.399 --> 05:55.799
- Yes.\N- I'd like to give you...

05:55.799 --> 05:58.799
a chance to make\Na contribution...

05:58.799 --> 06:00.399
to the national\Nfootprint database.

06:00.839 --> 06:02.099
Oh, really?

06:02.739 --> 06:04.370
It's such\Na huge job for me.

06:04.370 --> 06:05.810
I believe you have...

06:05.870 --> 06:07.710
the skills needed\Nto do the job.

06:08.880 --> 06:09.909
Thank you.

06:10.210 --> 06:11.250
Sure.

06:12.380 --> 06:14.080
It might be boring.

06:14.380 --> 06:15.380
Is that okay?

06:15.919 --> 06:16.919
Of course.

06:27.399 --> 06:28.899
I do not wish...

06:29.359 --> 06:31.529
to be disturbed by anyone.

06:34.969 --> 06:35.969
Pardon?

06:41.080 --> 06:42.080
That's hot.

06:42.279 --> 06:43.909
The roads around\NMount Chunhong...

06:43.909 --> 06:46.049
in Gangwon Province\Nthat were closed...

06:47.880 --> 06:49.750

06:58.659 --> 07:01.599

07:01.599 --> 07:04.799
to find out the damage\Nand to restore everything.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.539
You said the culprit\Ndefinitely got on camera.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.169
The culprit should exist\Nfor them to be on cameras.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.669
It's weird.\NThis case has no culprits.

07:18.549 --> 07:19.620
Before he died,

07:20.580 --> 07:22.950
no one heard\Nthe dorm superintendent...

07:23.320 --> 07:24.549
scream for help.

07:25.390 --> 07:27.190
There were a lot of people\Nin the student hall.

07:30.159 --> 07:31.159
The culprit...

07:31.430 --> 07:32.630
Was not at the scene.

07:33.799 --> 07:35.130
Then how was he killed?

07:35.130 --> 07:37.130
We'll find out now.\NLet's go.

07:37.130 --> 07:38.200
To the dead body?

07:38.630 --> 07:39.739
Then who else?

07:39.739 --> 07:40.839
There's\Nno eyewitness either.

07:40.839 --> 07:42.200
Let's go in order.

07:42.299 --> 07:43.510
Let's check on\NHan Gi Yong first.

07:43.510 --> 07:44.609
Let's go.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.139
What brought you here?

08:47.139 --> 08:48.540
We are scared.

08:48.540 --> 08:50.269
Isn't it safe\Nto stay in a group?

08:50.269 --> 08:51.969
I know,

08:51.969 --> 08:54.080
but we don't know\Nwho the culprit is.

08:54.239 --> 08:57.280
It's safer for us to\Nstay around Detective Ha.

08:57.479 --> 08:58.910
Don't you all\Nhave to study?

09:00.950 --> 09:03.719
Then don't disturb us,\Nand follow us well.

09:04.150 --> 09:07.389
Stay quiet when Seol Ok\Nis in thought.

09:07.790 --> 09:08.989
- Yes.\N- Okay.

09:10.129 --> 09:13.099
The first one that\Ngot killed is the cat.

09:23.239 --> 09:25.769
But the cat was fine\Nwhen we first arrived.

09:29.410 --> 09:32.379
That lady must have\Nkilled the cat.

09:32.879 --> 09:35.519
Kang Joo Yeon? The stalker\Nwho killed herself?

09:36.989 --> 09:38.450
Is she really a ghost?

09:38.450 --> 09:41.489
No, Kang Joo Yeon\Nis alive.

09:42.019 --> 09:43.930
The story about her\Nsuicide is just a rumor.

09:44.089 --> 09:45.690
She did quit her job.

09:46.930 --> 09:49.030
But I comforted her well\Nwhen she left.

09:49.930 --> 09:52.200
You mean Kang Joo Yeon\Nis not dead?

09:52.530 --> 09:54.900
Hold on. She might be\Nhiding somewhere here.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.609
It's even scarier.

09:56.609 --> 09:59.070
It must be a serial killer\Nsince three people died.

09:59.070 --> 10:01.479
Is it even possible to\Nkill a person...

10:01.479 --> 10:02.680
without getting caught\Non CCTVs?

10:02.680 --> 10:06.650
The killer must know\Nthis place really well.

10:08.019 --> 10:09.749
She's lost in thoughts.

10:10.790 --> 10:12.089
Oh, right.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.160
What's right?

10:14.660 --> 10:16.259
How do you think\Nit's killed?

10:16.930 --> 10:18.790
The suspect didn't leave\Na single scar.

10:19.389 --> 10:20.830
The suspect\Ndidn't get caught.

10:21.460 --> 10:23.070
There was no scream.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.670
There's a way to do\Nall that.

10:25.670 --> 10:27.639
What? Is there such a way?

10:27.639 --> 10:30.440
It must be the ghost.\NI knew it was the ghost.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.210
- Stop it. I'm scared.\N- I told you...

10:32.210 --> 10:33.739
- That it was...\N- Stay quiet!

10:34.780 --> 10:36.450
Tell me your thought.

10:38.979 --> 10:40.150
You all are here.

10:40.150 --> 10:41.650
Gosh, that startled me.

10:42.150 --> 10:44.119
The phone lines\Nare restored.

10:44.389 --> 10:45.950
I called the\Npolice station.

10:45.950 --> 10:47.960
The patrol car\Nis on its way.

10:47.960 --> 10:48.989
Oh, okay.

10:50.060 --> 10:52.690
So who killed\Nthose people?

10:52.690 --> 10:54.259
I have to find out now.

10:56.430 --> 10:57.469
Why are you looking at me?

10:57.469 --> 10:58.469
Detective Ha.

10:58.599 --> 11:01.170
Don't you have to call\NJoongjin Police Station?

11:03.210 --> 11:05.339
The work can't be done\Nwithout me.

11:05.339 --> 11:07.410
I have so many\Ndirections to give.

11:07.810 --> 11:09.040
I'm worried.

11:15.349 --> 11:17.119
Why are you calling me,\NLieutenant Ha?

11:17.119 --> 11:19.790
I wanted to tell you my\Ncell phone doesn't work.

11:21.519 --> 11:22.519
Sorry?

11:22.989 --> 11:24.030
Jurisdiction?

11:24.690 --> 11:26.359
Who cares about\Njurisdiction...

11:26.359 --> 11:27.800
when three people\Nare dead?

11:27.960 --> 11:31.030
Are you giving me\Nan order?

11:31.030 --> 11:32.070
I mean...

11:32.269 --> 11:35.239
Mr. Hwang, I'm not\Ngiving you an order.

11:35.739 --> 11:38.639
You're the only excellent\Nagent who can identify...

11:38.810 --> 11:40.009
things via telephone.\NI don't know anyone...

11:40.009 --> 11:41.210
who's better than you.

11:42.710 --> 11:46.009
You can give me the number\Nif there's anyone better.

11:46.009 --> 11:49.479
I can't think\Nof anyone else.

11:49.749 --> 11:53.989
It's not like I don't\Nunderstand your situation.

11:53.989 --> 11:55.759
Can you tell me the\Ndead body's condition?

11:56.089 --> 11:58.989
So the blood is dark red.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.460
The skin's rough.

12:00.759 --> 12:02.800
The nails turned white.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.999
The whites of the eyes...

12:04.570 --> 12:07.099
are yellow.\NIt must be jaundice.

12:07.469 --> 12:10.540
Okay. I'll check on\Nsimilar cases.

12:10.540 --> 12:12.139
But first, give me the\Ntheir medical histories.

12:12.139 --> 12:14.109
Find out their conditions\Nof the last week...

12:14.109 --> 12:15.979
before their deaths,\Nand call me back.

12:15.979 --> 12:17.080
Thank you, sir.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.280
What did Mr. Hwang say?

12:19.379 --> 12:20.820
- He'll check it for us.\N- Gosh.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.989
I have to flatter him\Nto get something.

12:23.989 --> 12:24.989
Give me that.

12:27.259 --> 12:28.359
I said give it to me.

12:30.030 --> 12:31.460
- Sorry?\N- The conditions of...

12:31.460 --> 12:32.930
dead bodies. I told you\Nto write them down.

12:34.030 --> 12:35.729
- When?\N- I purposely said them...

12:35.729 --> 12:37.729
aloud for you\Nto write them down.

12:38.830 --> 12:41.040
You didn't tell me\Nanything.

12:42.670 --> 12:45.440
Then write down whatever\Nyou overheard now.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.910
I don't remember them.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.609
Did you give money under\Nthe table to get into...

12:52.609 --> 12:54.420
the National Police\NUniversity?

12:54.749 --> 12:56.650
Dark red. Rough skin.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.719
White nails.\NJaundice symptoms.

12:58.719 --> 13:00.119
Can't you remember\Nthese four?

13:14.639 --> 13:15.769
I get it now.

13:18.639 --> 13:20.180
Why couldn't I\Nthink of this earlier?

13:20.310 --> 13:22.680
What? Have you\Nfigured something out?

13:26.820 --> 13:29.280
Except for Han Gi Yong\Nwho fell from a treadmill,

13:29.519 --> 13:32.589
everyone else died without\Nany external injury.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.560
I'm sure about this.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.359
It's a poisoning case.

13:43.229 --> 13:45.469
It seems like they're dead\Nfrom poisoning...

13:45.469 --> 13:47.839
or acute renal failure\Nbased on their conditions.

13:47.839 --> 13:49.269
Were they poisoned?

13:49.400 --> 13:52.869
Oh, you're smarter than\NI thought. I'm surprised.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.509
You'll know for sure...

13:54.509 --> 13:57.150
if corpses undergo toxic\Nsubstance examination.

13:57.150 --> 13:58.879
He said\Nthey were poisoned.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.119
What kind of poison\Nwas it?

14:00.119 --> 14:02.320
- Which poison was used?\N- Put me on the phone.

14:05.989 --> 14:07.190
Mr. Hwang.

14:07.259 --> 14:08.560
Ms. Yoo Seol Ok?

14:09.389 --> 14:10.930
So it's true.

14:11.190 --> 14:12.859
What do you mean?

14:12.859 --> 14:14.330
I heard that you\Nand Lieutenant Ha...

14:14.330 --> 14:16.570
are always together\Nduring his working hours.

14:16.570 --> 14:18.170
We're not always together.

14:18.170 --> 14:21.040
Detective Ha came to\Nsee me this time.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.009
That makes me\Nsound like a stalker.

14:23.239 --> 14:25.570
What kind of\Npoison was it?

14:25.570 --> 14:26.910
There are many\Npossibilities.

14:26.910 --> 14:28.839
Paratoxin. Verotoxin.

14:28.839 --> 14:30.780
If not, it could be\Nred clay mushroom.

14:30.780 --> 14:31.879
It could also be\Npoisonous mushrooms...

14:31.879 --> 14:32.979
like fly mushroom.

14:32.979 --> 14:35.680
Poisonous mushrooms?\NThey're everywhere here.

14:37.349 --> 14:40.060
Thank you. Thank you.

14:46.060 --> 14:47.530
I'm sure it was poisoning.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.700
My goodness. Why\Ncouldn't I think of it?

14:49.900 --> 14:52.300
If you think about it,\Nthat was the only way.

14:53.339 --> 14:55.540
Nobody heard any screaming\Nfrom the dead people.

14:55.700 --> 14:57.739
The culprit didn't get\Ncaught on CCTVs.

14:58.139 --> 14:59.639
The culprit poisoned\Nthem in advance.

14:59.639 --> 15:01.609
There was no need for him\Nto be in the crime scene.

15:02.479 --> 15:04.210
It's all because of\NKang Joo Yeon.

15:04.249 --> 15:05.479
Kang Joo Yeon?

15:05.479 --> 15:07.820
She said she'll kill him\Nafter a week.

15:07.820 --> 15:09.889
Everyone thought that this\Nwas done by a ghost...

15:09.889 --> 15:12.219
because of the rumor that\Nshe killed herself.

15:13.190 --> 15:14.519
Because of the fear,

15:14.519 --> 15:17.290
we couldn't see that\Nthe blood was dark red...

15:17.629 --> 15:19.660
and the nails were white.

15:20.660 --> 15:23.400
So everyone was hypnotized\Nby Kang Joo Yeon.

15:23.900 --> 15:26.739
Wait there. I'll come back\Nto kill you after a week.

15:26.739 --> 15:29.469
I'll become a ghost\Nand kill you!

15:29.499 --> 15:30.769
You too!

15:31.869 --> 15:34.040
I thought the culprit\Nwas Kang Joo Yeon.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.540
Whether she was\Na ghost or not.

15:36.180 --> 15:38.749
It makes sense because\Nthey died after a week.

15:40.249 --> 15:42.619
So that one week\Nwas just a coincidence?

15:42.619 --> 15:43.690
No.

15:44.889 --> 15:47.420
That one week\Nis an important clue.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.229
Are you saying Kang\NJoo Yeon is back or what?

15:52.900 --> 15:54.830
- Something like that.\N- Really?

15:56.030 --> 15:59.400
You're saying\Nthe serial killer is here?

15:59.739 --> 16:01.300
Nobody was caught\Non the CCTVs.

16:01.300 --> 16:02.339
What if...

16:03.210 --> 16:04.639
she's back?

16:06.109 --> 16:07.540
What if she came back...

16:08.180 --> 16:09.879
and could get into\Nthe office?

16:43.310 --> 16:44.450
You're right.

16:44.509 --> 16:47.320
This office is the only\Nplace without the CCTV.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.080
She didn't get caught\Non the CCTV...

16:49.080 --> 16:50.119
and got into office.

16:50.389 --> 16:52.019
If she didn't come out\Nfrom there...

16:52.019 --> 16:53.920
Yes, you're right.

16:55.219 --> 16:56.330
Hold on.

16:57.089 --> 17:00.560
This means she was hiding\Nin the staff's office.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.099
Gosh, it's scary.

17:03.129 --> 17:04.628
Seol Ok, let's go.

17:04.700 --> 17:05.700
Okay.

17:11.069 --> 17:13.710
How was the forensics\Nteam's work?

17:15.009 --> 17:16.109
Oh, yes.

17:17.380 --> 17:18.450
It's something...

17:19.150 --> 17:21.349
that I have never\Nexperienced before.

17:23.650 --> 17:25.950
You're in love with\Nscientific investigation.

17:25.950 --> 17:27.089
Yes, sort of.

17:27.819 --> 17:28.890
Good.

17:28.890 --> 17:31.430
Then I'll make sure you\Ncan get training...

17:31.860 --> 17:33.130
from here.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.600
Thank you,

17:35.799 --> 17:37.900
but I don't think\NI'm qualified.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.269
You know yourself well.

17:39.370 --> 17:43.170
But if I teach you,\Nit won't be impossible.

17:43.170 --> 17:44.170
I think...

17:44.340 --> 17:46.309
I suit better in\Nthe violent crimes unit.

17:47.710 --> 17:48.739
You're humble.

17:48.979 --> 17:52.009
Still, don't underestimate\Nyour ability.

17:52.009 --> 17:53.579
Sir, I really...

17:53.579 --> 17:54.749
You're flustered.

17:55.380 --> 17:58.120
Destiny comes by accident\Njust like that.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.160
I'll help you become\Nnumber two in this field.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.460
Sir, I'm not ready yet.

18:02.460 --> 18:03.529
But I'm ready.

18:03.529 --> 18:05.630
Your grade is enough to\Njoin the forensics team.

18:05.630 --> 18:06.660
I made this\Nan exception...

18:06.660 --> 18:09.130
and requested\Nyour appointment myself.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.529
I'm done talking with the\Npolice superintendent too.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.170
- What?\N- I understand...

18:13.170 --> 18:14.940
that you want to\Nkeep talking with me,

18:14.940 --> 18:15.940
but I'm busy.

18:15.940 --> 18:17.710
The country's crimes\Nare on my hands.

18:17.710 --> 18:19.880
I have no time\Nto chitchat with my pupil.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.739
- So go now.\N- Sir!

18:23.979 --> 18:27.420
I have to analyze\Nthe minute evidence,

18:27.620 --> 18:29.219
so I'm very sensitive now.

18:45.569 --> 18:46.940
Excuse me.

18:51.769 --> 18:52.870
You're here.

18:53.509 --> 18:56.380
Si Hwan,\Nwhere have you been...

18:56.380 --> 18:58.009
when things are so hectic?

18:58.710 --> 18:59.779
I'm sorry.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.150
He helped the detective\Nwith us...

19:02.150 --> 19:03.590
for the case\Nto be settled quickly.

19:03.590 --> 19:05.120
What if someone else\Ngets killed again?

19:06.890 --> 19:08.660
The roads have been\Nfully recovered.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.029
The police\Nwill arrive soon.

19:11.329 --> 19:13.630
There's no trace of Kang\NJoo Yeon coming in here.

19:13.729 --> 19:14.759
Kang Joo Yeon?

19:15.360 --> 19:17.900
Why would she\Ncome in here?

19:18.170 --> 19:19.170
It's not certain.

19:19.170 --> 19:20.670
She might have been.

19:21.640 --> 19:22.739
By the way,

19:23.170 --> 19:25.440
which one is\NPark In Ae's desk?

19:26.110 --> 19:27.110
This one.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.650
What was her duty here?

19:30.009 --> 19:32.110
She was in charge\Nof bookkeeping.

19:37.789 --> 19:39.249
She must've liked\Ndrinking tea.

19:39.249 --> 19:41.259
She drank tea all the time\Nin the office.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.460
Do you want to\Ndrink too, Noo Ri?

19:45.460 --> 19:46.729
Do you want some?

19:46.729 --> 19:48.360
Here it is, Noo Ri.

19:48.930 --> 19:51.370
Go ahead. Isn't it good?

19:51.370 --> 19:53.170
It's my favorite tea.

19:53.170 --> 19:55.700
She sometimes shared\Nit with her cat?

19:56.469 --> 19:59.039
Well, I think so.

19:59.340 --> 20:00.979
That's why the cat died.

20:03.850 --> 20:06.779
It's just the rooibos tea.

20:07.719 --> 20:08.819
It must be here...

20:09.319 --> 20:10.390
since it's been\Nonly a week.

20:12.219 --> 20:13.259
What?

20:13.460 --> 20:16.019
Fortunately,\Nshe wasn't so diligent.

20:18.860 --> 20:21.200
It smells like tap water.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.499
Do you mean, chlorine?

20:23.729 --> 20:24.729
Yes.

20:28.739 --> 20:30.809
What are you doing?

20:31.170 --> 20:32.340
It's suffocating.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.039
- Do you have a cigarette?\N- I smoke e-cigarettes.

20:35.640 --> 20:36.779
Do you have one?

20:37.150 --> 20:38.350
I don't smoke.

20:39.079 --> 20:40.150
Do you smoke?

20:41.150 --> 20:42.249
It doesn't smell\Nlike cigarettes.

20:44.989 --> 20:46.120
The smell...

20:46.819 --> 20:48.019
comes from here.

20:48.690 --> 20:49.989
You're like a dog.

20:49.989 --> 20:51.229
It's just that she's\Nsensitive at smelling.

20:51.229 --> 20:52.289
How could you\Ncall her a dog?

20:53.499 --> 20:54.499
It's interesting.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.569
Accidents occur\Nwherever you go.

20:57.999 --> 21:00.900
Let's go get an exorcism\Nwhen we go back to Seoul.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.210
I really wanted\Nto focus on studying.

21:12.880 --> 21:13.880
What's this?

21:18.620 --> 21:20.259
Why was\Nthis cigarette filter...

21:21.120 --> 21:22.789
in the rooibos tea bag?

21:26.430 --> 21:27.430
It's strange.

21:28.529 --> 21:29.769
It's strange indeed.

21:30.529 --> 21:31.529
What is this?

21:32.799 --> 21:34.239
"Peace"?

21:36.569 --> 21:38.870
It's the same smell.

21:39.140 --> 21:40.410
The smell of disinfectant.

21:42.739 --> 21:44.150
I can't smell it.

21:44.309 --> 21:46.749
You really are\Ngood at smelling.

21:46.749 --> 21:48.319
You can't touch it\Nwith your bare hand.

21:48.779 --> 21:50.049
It's amatoxin.

21:50.049 --> 21:52.190
Amatoxin?

21:53.420 --> 21:55.289
Yes, amatoxin.

21:55.289 --> 21:56.329
It's the act of suicide\Nto put your hand...

21:56.329 --> 21:57.930
to the mouth after you\Ntouch amatoxin with it.

21:57.930 --> 21:59.660
You can be poisoned\Nonly with a little amount.

21:59.660 --> 22:02.460
It's a toxic material\Nfound in fly mushrooms.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.999
The first symptoms are\Nvomiting and diarrhea.

22:04.999 --> 22:06.600
But after a week of\Nincubation period,

22:06.600 --> 22:09.170
it causes a fatal damage\Non liver cells.

22:09.170 --> 22:10.769
After about a week,

22:11.410 --> 22:13.140
the person dies\Nof liver cell necrosis.

22:17.910 --> 22:18.979
This place...

22:19.579 --> 22:21.120
is perfect...

22:21.650 --> 22:23.219
for Park In Ae to be\Npoisoned to death.

22:24.249 --> 22:27.420
Right, it's the only place\Nwithout any CCTVs.

22:28.090 --> 22:30.559
Her favorite\Nrooibos tea bags...

22:32.690 --> 22:34.559
were always left\Nunattended like that.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.479
But how did the culprit\Nget their hands on...

22:48.479 --> 22:49.809
such a thing\Nin this remote area?

22:50.150 --> 22:51.910
Someone must've\Nbrought it in with them.

22:52.509 --> 22:54.719
Kang Joo Yeon, perhaps.

22:55.620 --> 22:58.519
Right. When she came to\Nthe boarding institution,

22:58.519 --> 23:00.219
she already\Nhad the poison.

23:38.130 --> 23:41.299
Peace cigarettes weren't\Nsold in the cafeteria,

23:41.299 --> 23:43.299
and only Han Gi Yong\Nsmoked them.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.329
It was perfect for her\Nto put in the poison.

23:45.329 --> 23:47.900
You. Wait there.

23:47.900 --> 23:49.840
I'll come back to kill you\Nafter a week.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.370
I'll become a ghost\Nand kill you!

23:52.640 --> 23:53.710
You too!

23:55.039 --> 23:56.039
Let me go.

23:57.950 --> 23:58.950
Let go!

24:11.559 --> 24:14.100
She knew exactly\Nabout the poison.

24:14.100 --> 24:16.200
That's why she\Nmentioned a week.

24:16.670 --> 24:17.670
Then...

24:18.130 --> 24:20.370
the culprit\Nis Kang Joo Yeon.

24:20.940 --> 24:22.940
That's the case for\NHan Gi Yong's death.

24:23.110 --> 24:26.239
But it's a totally\Ndifferent case...

24:26.239 --> 24:27.640
for Kim Yeong Seon\Nand Park In Ae's deaths.

24:28.180 --> 24:30.509
Why did the dorm\Nsuperintendent die?

24:30.650 --> 24:31.650
Oh, right.

24:31.650 --> 24:33.779
He smoked Han Gi Yong's\Ncigarettes in secret.

24:44.190 --> 24:46.930
Only Han Gi Yong smokes\NPeace cigarettes.

24:47.130 --> 24:49.529
He always complained\Nthat his cigarettes...

24:49.529 --> 24:50.769
kept disappearing.

24:51.700 --> 24:52.700
Okay.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.440
What? My cigarettes\Ndisappeared again.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.049
Who on earth stole them?

25:06.319 --> 25:08.219
So did he die\Njust because he smoke...

25:08.219 --> 25:09.519
someone else's cigarette?

25:10.319 --> 25:11.420
Right, it's unfair.

25:11.420 --> 25:13.019
What about Park In Ae?

25:13.890 --> 25:15.719
What's\Nthis cigarette filter...

25:15.719 --> 25:17.029
found in the tea bag?

25:17.590 --> 25:20.460
It had only half the\Namount of cigarettes,

25:20.700 --> 25:22.729
but the case was\Nbrand new.

25:27.739 --> 25:28.840
The culprit switched\Ncigarette cases.

25:29.969 --> 25:32.569
The one with the poisoned\Ncigarettes is the culprit.

25:32.569 --> 25:33.579
Oh, right.

25:39.549 --> 25:41.279
You don't smoke,

25:41.650 --> 25:44.049
but why do you have\NPeace cigarettes?

25:45.319 --> 25:46.360
What?

25:46.719 --> 25:47.759
What is she talking about?

25:49.019 --> 25:50.559
What do you mean?

25:53.829 --> 25:54.900
What's wrong with her?

25:58.069 --> 25:59.739
I found it in this drawer.

26:22.660 --> 26:23.660
(Peace)

26:23.660 --> 26:24.660
What is this?

26:31.529 --> 26:34.370
Why would you go through\Nmy drawers?

26:34.370 --> 26:36.069
I didn't go through them.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.239
I only found it just now.

26:39.979 --> 26:41.410
Excuse me.

26:47.950 --> 26:48.950
This is...

26:49.590 --> 26:50.890
Han Gi Yong's, right?

26:51.920 --> 26:53.420
The cigarettes poisoned\Nby Kang Joo Yeon.

26:55.690 --> 26:58.229
You switched\Nthe cigarettes...

26:58.759 --> 27:00.259
to kill Park In Ae.

27:02.999 --> 27:03.999
(Student Cigarette Box)

27:05.829 --> 27:08.140
(Peace)

27:15.809 --> 27:17.850
You spread the rumor\Nthat Kang Joo Yeon...

27:17.850 --> 27:18.950
killed herself,\Ndidn't you?

27:19.850 --> 27:21.120
You also scared\NPark In Ae,

27:21.120 --> 27:23.289
saying you saw\NKang Joo Yeon.

27:26.660 --> 27:28.489
You saw her?

27:28.620 --> 27:29.630
Yes.

27:29.630 --> 27:31.329
She was standing\Nin front of your room.

27:31.529 --> 27:32.999
But she's dead.

27:32.999 --> 27:35.529
I know. I searched through\Nall the CCTV footages,

27:35.759 --> 27:36.799
but she wasn't captured.

27:37.900 --> 27:40.539
Then are you saying she's\Na ghost or something?

27:43.769 --> 27:46.039
That's why you knew\NHan Gi Yong would die,

27:46.039 --> 27:47.610
but didn't tell\Nanyone about it.

27:48.110 --> 27:49.180
Isn't that right?

27:55.749 --> 27:57.120
- Detective Ha.\N- Darn it.

28:01.059 --> 28:02.190
Hey!

28:13.900 --> 28:15.700
Hey! Stop right there!

28:38.759 --> 28:40.759
Hey, move. Goodness.

28:53.509 --> 28:54.809
Where did he go?

29:34.180 --> 29:35.819
It was\Nreally hard to quit.

29:48.600 --> 29:52.430
I messed with\NMr. Han's cigarettes.

29:55.269 --> 29:58.840
We have to go back now\Nbefore it's too late.

29:59.809 --> 30:02.210
Before Mr. Han\Nsmokes them.

30:04.009 --> 30:07.479
Don't worry.\NI'll throw them all out.

30:07.579 --> 30:09.479
I called them earlier.

30:09.690 --> 30:11.289
I'm sure\Nthey threw them out.

30:13.319 --> 30:14.460
I have a question.

30:15.519 --> 30:19.059
Does that poison\Nkill you in a week?

30:20.860 --> 30:21.930
Yes.

30:23.370 --> 30:25.799
I've worked part-time\Nat a chemical lab.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.870
I sneaked out some\Nto get my revenge.

30:31.140 --> 30:33.539
I must've gone insane.

30:37.779 --> 30:39.079
It's okay, Joo Yeon.

30:55.130 --> 30:57.870
May I have\Na pack of Peace?

31:01.370 --> 31:05.170
(Student Cigarette Box)

31:51.319 --> 31:52.450
Oh Seong Tae.

32:12.140 --> 32:14.079
It'll take a week\Nfor that to kill you.

32:14.279 --> 32:15.640
Just turn yourself in.

32:36.930 --> 32:38.229
What about Kang Joo Yeon?

32:38.600 --> 32:39.969
She was caught\Nat her home.

32:40.299 --> 32:42.499
It was just an attempt,\Nbut she will be punished.

32:43.210 --> 32:46.239
Why did he murder them\Nin such a complicated way?

32:46.680 --> 32:48.140
He even used poison.

32:48.140 --> 32:49.440
He was going to blame...

32:49.440 --> 32:51.309
Kang Joo Yeon\Nfor everything.

32:58.249 --> 33:00.319
Will this place be\Nclosed for a while?

33:01.789 --> 33:03.690
You got sacked\Nas soon as you got a job.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.930
I'm going to leave\Neven if they begged me...

33:06.930 --> 33:08.360
to stay here.

33:08.430 --> 33:11.299
Three people died here.\NHow can we stay?

33:11.299 --> 33:13.370
Are you all going back\Nto Noryang-dong?

33:13.370 --> 33:14.539
- Yes.\N- Yes.

33:16.710 --> 33:19.239
Hop in.\NI'm going there too.

33:19.610 --> 33:20.880
What about you?

33:20.880 --> 33:22.079
Why?\NWill you give me a ride?

33:22.079 --> 33:23.710
- No, it's full.\N- Why do you ask?

33:23.710 --> 33:25.350
So how will you go home?

33:25.350 --> 33:26.450
I'm only giving\NSeol Ok a ride.

33:26.450 --> 33:27.819
Seol Ok?

33:29.819 --> 33:30.890
Hey, Seol Ok.

33:31.289 --> 33:32.960
How dare you\Ncall her by name?

33:33.090 --> 33:34.890
We're an item.

33:34.890 --> 33:37.029
We'll find a way.\NYou guys can go.

33:37.489 --> 33:38.890
Study hard, okay?

33:39.229 --> 33:40.360
Don't fail twice.

33:41.759 --> 33:42.860
Let's go.

33:56.850 --> 33:58.610
What were you\Nasking Oh Seong Tae?

33:59.380 --> 34:01.279
I wanted to know\Nwhy he killed Park In Ae.

34:02.850 --> 34:05.219
She probably caught him\Npocketing money.

34:06.019 --> 34:08.319
She threatened to tell on\Nhim to the superintendent.

34:09.360 --> 34:10.460
How did you know?

34:10.460 --> 34:12.929
You don't have to ask.\NIt's my instinct.

34:12.929 --> 34:14.228
Did you beat him up\Nand ask him...

34:14.228 --> 34:15.929
when you arrested him?

34:15.929 --> 34:18.599
It's so obvious.\NI don't have to beat him.

34:18.829 --> 34:20.739
Nowadays, we can't\Nbeat anyone up.

34:20.900 --> 34:21.969
Really?

34:25.369 --> 34:28.880
I was really going to\Njust study this time.

34:29.849 --> 34:31.150
You solved a case again.

34:31.150 --> 34:32.150
Yes.

34:35.079 --> 34:36.650
Come to think about it,

34:36.650 --> 34:39.349
you get involved\Nin the weirdest cases.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.219
Let's do an exorcism.

34:42.219 --> 34:44.289
I'll find a good\Nand cheap shaman.

34:44.289 --> 34:46.300
I have 29 dollars\Nin my bank account.

34:46.300 --> 34:48.429
So why didn't you\Ntell me...

34:48.429 --> 34:50.728
before you walked into\Nthis boarding institution?

34:50.728 --> 34:52.429
I'm not your subordinate.

34:52.429 --> 34:54.070
Do I need your permission\Nfor everything?

34:54.070 --> 34:56.570
You can at least discuss\Nwith your life savior.

34:56.670 --> 34:59.309
Do you know how many times\NI saved your life?

34:59.309 --> 35:02.139
It's the same as\Nthe number of cases...

35:02.139 --> 35:04.380
that I resolved\Nwhen you couldn't.

35:06.380 --> 35:07.650
You're bragging now.

35:07.650 --> 35:10.550
Detective Ha,\Nwhy did you come?

35:13.619 --> 35:16.559
She can come work here\Nwithout taking a test.

35:19.289 --> 35:20.329
(Administrative\Nassistant wanted)

35:30.940 --> 35:32.110
What is this?

35:32.110 --> 35:33.679
You can come work\Nat the station...

35:33.679 --> 35:35.510
without taking a test.

35:37.249 --> 35:39.780
What's administrative\Nassistant?

35:41.320 --> 35:42.720
Well, it's...

35:42.990 --> 35:45.249
They scrap news articles\Nregarding our station...

35:45.249 --> 35:47.059
and make a report\Nfor our chief.

35:47.059 --> 35:48.889
The fastest position\Nto find out about cases.

35:50.530 --> 35:53.559
Then can I be a part\Nof investigations?

35:53.559 --> 35:55.030
They just run\Ntedious errands.

35:55.030 --> 35:57.030
You'll be looking at\Nthe big picture.

35:57.999 --> 36:01.800
Then can I go and catch\Nall the criminals?

36:01.800 --> 36:03.340
You can pick and choose...

36:03.340 --> 36:05.869
the cases you want to\Nsolve from Unit 1 to 5.

36:10.349 --> 36:12.809
Detective Ha,\Nthank you so much.

36:12.809 --> 36:14.179
A lot of people\Nwant that spot,

36:14.179 --> 36:16.079
so I took the flyer off\Nto give it to you.

36:16.220 --> 36:18.990
I climbed a mountain and\Ncrossed a river for you.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.889
I'm so touched.

36:24.329 --> 36:27.860
I mean, I was just worried\Nyou'd make no money...

36:28.300 --> 36:31.130
and end up\Nliving with me forever.

36:31.329 --> 36:35.539
You're the one\Nwho's living at my house.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.240
You're right. That was me.

36:46.519 --> 36:49.889
Your call cannot be\Nconnected. Please...

36:50.749 --> 36:52.849
Why won't she pick up?

36:54.260 --> 36:56.460
She's probably\Nat the store anyway.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.130
What?

37:09.639 --> 37:12.269
Closed for three months\Nuntil the owner...

37:12.269 --> 37:14.440
passes the police\Nemployment exam.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.840
A boarding institution?

37:17.179 --> 37:18.880
Then what about the store?

37:21.949 --> 37:24.289
It's my fault for leaving\Nher with the store.

37:27.659 --> 37:28.889
Everyone,

37:28.889 --> 37:31.889
it's finally spring,\Na great season to love.

37:32.429 --> 37:35.999
I'll read you a story\Nof a beautiful couple.

37:36.729 --> 37:38.729
- "I'm a job seeker."\N- Oh, my.

37:38.729 --> 37:41.940
- "I applied a lot..."\N- It's spring.

37:42.570 --> 37:45.139
I was busy studying that\NI didn't know it's spring.

37:45.470 --> 37:47.409
I know. I didn't realize\Nthat it's spring in Seoul,

37:47.409 --> 37:49.409
but it feels like\Nspring here.

37:51.610 --> 37:54.119
I bought a ring\Nto propose...

37:54.519 --> 37:57.720
to my girlfriend\Non her birthday.

37:58.090 --> 38:00.920
She's supported me\Nfor three years.

38:01.590 --> 38:04.929
Will my girlfriend\Naccept my ring?

38:04.929 --> 38:06.030
You think she will?

38:06.329 --> 38:07.599
Ring, my foot.

38:09.769 --> 38:10.800
By the way,

38:11.599 --> 38:13.269
why did she steal\Nthe ring?

38:22.880 --> 38:23.979
Lady.

38:24.510 --> 38:25.610
Wait right there.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.249
You are under arrest.

38:30.490 --> 38:31.889
Maybe she ran out\Nof money.

38:33.059 --> 38:35.260
That's probably why she's\Nkeeping it a secret.

38:38.889 --> 38:39.960
What?

38:40.599 --> 38:41.599
Lady.

38:42.329 --> 38:43.829
Why don't you\Ntalk about the ring?

38:45.400 --> 38:47.199
What does it have to\Ndo with me?

38:47.199 --> 38:48.199
Why should I\Ntalk about it?

38:48.199 --> 38:49.769
What do you mean?

38:49.769 --> 38:51.440
Do you know\Nhow expensive it is?

38:51.440 --> 38:53.610
I didn't buy that for you.\NIt's for someone else.

38:53.610 --> 38:54.610
Give it back to me\Nright now.

38:54.610 --> 38:57.579
Why are you asking me\Nto give it to you?

38:57.579 --> 38:59.920
Then who else?\NYou have it.

39:00.820 --> 39:01.880
Did you...

39:02.889 --> 39:04.619
- give it to me?\N- Don't tell me...

39:05.050 --> 39:06.150
you didn't get it.

39:06.260 --> 39:07.490
What are you\Ntalking about?

39:10.229 --> 39:11.990
What happened to the ring?

39:12.329 --> 39:13.760
I gave it to her for sure.

39:14.229 --> 39:16.630
I saw him giving it\Nto some other girl.

39:17.199 --> 39:18.229
I'm sure of it.

39:18.729 --> 39:19.800
Did she sell it?\NThat must be why...

39:19.800 --> 39:20.900
she's acting brazen.

39:36.590 --> 39:37.889

39:38.249 --> 39:40.190
The traffic was bad.

39:40.190 --> 39:42.789
No, I just came out also.

39:44.659 --> 39:46.559
You're still wearing it.

39:46.999 --> 39:47.999
Yes.

Here.

40:00.179 --> 40:01.979
It's not something\Nexpensive.

40:01.979 --> 40:03.309
I brought it for you\Nto wear it...

40:03.309 --> 40:04.949
because there are\Nreporters coming.

40:06.010 --> 40:08.380
You've done more than\Nenough for the event.

40:08.380 --> 40:09.690
No worries.

40:11.050 --> 40:13.690
I've been taken many\Nphotos wearing this.

40:14.619 --> 40:15.920

44:26.210 --> 44:28.110
if I stay\Nas the president.

44:28.940 --> 44:31.050
Why would you delegate\Nsuch a big role to me?

44:31.780 --> 44:34.449
I'd be relieved\Nif someone who...

44:34.449 --> 44:36.349
is interested in helping\Nothers take that position.

44:37.349 --> 44:38.849
You're perfect for it.

44:39.449 --> 44:40.590
Please take the position.

44:51.329 --> 44:52.329
Seol Ok.

44:52.670 --> 44:54.400
Let's get\Na good sleep tonight.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.470
Let's not do anything.

44:55.470 --> 44:57.970
I wouldn't stop you\Nfrom sleeping. Sleep well.

44:57.970 --> 44:59.369
You've been after\Nso many cases that...

44:59.369 --> 45:00.880
I couldn't sleep well.

45:04.349 --> 45:05.449
Seol Ok.

45:06.079 --> 45:07.150
Kyung Mi.

45:08.280 --> 45:11.150
You don't look happy to\Nsee me after a long time.

45:11.389 --> 45:12.550
No, I'm happy to see you.

45:12.720 --> 45:13.760
I'm happy.

45:13.760 --> 45:16.059
Oh, my goodness. You're\Nhere too, Detective Ha.

45:16.059 --> 45:17.360
It's been a while.

45:18.190 --> 45:20.499
Are you two back together?

45:20.499 --> 45:22.829
- No, we're not.\N- It's nothing like that.

45:24.929 --> 45:27.099
Come in.\NLet's have dinner.

45:27.099 --> 45:30.039
No, Detective Ha\Nis quite busy.

45:30.039 --> 45:31.639
Yes, I'm busy.

45:31.769 --> 45:33.280
But you should eat\Neven if you're busy.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.309
We all work to eat.

45:35.639 --> 45:36.979
I don't want to\Ntrouble you.

45:36.979 --> 45:38.179
That's not like you.

45:38.409 --> 45:39.949
I just have to take out\None more plate for you.

45:39.949 --> 45:40.979
Come in.

45:46.260 --> 45:48.320
- What shall we do?\N- What are we going to do?

45:48.720 --> 45:50.460
She will doubt us more\Nif I don't eat.

45:54.460 --> 45:56.030
But it smells good.

45:56.269 --> 45:57.929
It's been a while since\Nthis house had good smell.

45:57.929 --> 45:59.229
Kyung Mi's smell.

46:00.470 --> 46:02.070
- Should I eat?\N- You should eat and go.

46:09.210 --> 46:11.809
Have you two starved\Nwhile I wasn't not around?

46:13.780 --> 46:14.780
There was a murder case.

46:14.780 --> 46:16.420
I couldn't open the store.

46:16.420 --> 46:17.619
A murder case?

46:17.619 --> 46:19.789
- Yes, a murder case.\N- I'll tell you later.

46:20.420 --> 46:21.720
Why aren't you eating?

46:22.190 --> 46:24.389
I'm on a diet.

46:27.400 --> 46:29.869
How can you cook so well?

46:30.329 --> 46:31.699
Wasn't I as good?

46:32.229 --> 46:34.740
You can cook nice stew.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.210
But you can't make\Nnice namul.

46:37.210 --> 46:38.970
Come on.\NYou finished everything.

46:41.909 --> 46:43.579
Did Detective Ha\Ncook for you as well?

46:43.579 --> 46:44.749
When did he?

46:51.789 --> 46:53.760
It's just that\Nhe looks like a chef.

46:58.929 --> 46:59.960
Does he?

47:04.599 --> 47:05.900
Don't cough at me.

47:19.409 --> 47:22.079
This place is too big\Nfor one person.

47:22.650 --> 47:23.789
Yes, it is.

47:24.449 --> 47:26.360
Why don't you rent out\None of your rooms?

47:26.360 --> 47:28.860
The utility fee in this\Ncomplex is very high.

47:29.090 --> 47:30.429
I'll check for you.

47:31.190 --> 47:32.289
Will you?

47:34.059 --> 47:35.699
I'll move that myself.\NGive it to me.

47:35.699 --> 47:36.699

Countless names fight...

48:44.130 --> 48:45.599
I'm torn...

48:46.970 --> 48:48.139
just which name...

48:48.800 --> 48:51.240
I should choose today.

48:58.409 --> 49:00.079
What about you?

49:02.119 --> 49:04.249
How many names\Ndo you have?

49:07.119 --> 49:08.260
What is...

49:09.630 --> 49:11.130
your name...

49:12.929 --> 49:14.199
for today?

49:26.139 --> 49:27.139
Good work.

49:27.139 --> 49:29.210

I'm Seo Hyun Soo.\NI want to meet you.

50:14.090 --> 50:16.289
I heard you can help me.

50:16.860 --> 50:18.659
I'm being chased now.

51:24.059 --> 51:25.190
Shall I do it?

51:25.190 --> 51:26.900
I've already got\Nmy hands on it.

51:27.099 --> 51:29.059
Go take care\Nof Detective Ha.

51:33.999 --> 51:35.800
Are you done packing\Nyour stuff?

52:01.960 --> 52:03.769
Pack the stuff\Nin the bathroom.

52:12.869 --> 52:14.179
Oh, right. The bathroom.

52:16.409 --> 52:18.809
It's started signaling.

52:18.979 --> 52:20.380
I need to go\Nto the bathroom.

52:20.380 --> 52:22.320
- Gosh, my stomach.\N- Wait.

52:23.119 --> 52:26.389
I'm sorry, but I can't\Nyield on the bathroom.

52:26.389 --> 52:28.119
It's urgent for me.

52:30.360 --> 52:31.659
Go first.

52:31.829 --> 52:32.929
Thank you.

52:36.699 --> 52:39.229
Gosh, that brat.\NIt must be really urgent.

52:45.170 --> 52:47.110
You look fat\Nall of a sudden.

52:49.809 --> 52:51.909
Why is it so cold?\NAm I catching a cold?

52:55.179 --> 52:56.389
Hey!

53:15.340 --> 53:17.309
Kyung Mi,\Ncome use it quickly.

53:17.309 --> 53:18.409
Okay.

53:23.010 --> 53:24.349
It's strange.

53:24.349 --> 53:26.550
You look fat\Nall of a sudden too.

53:43.199 --> 53:46.099
Why did she come home\Nall of a sudden?

53:46.099 --> 53:47.999
Her training must\Nnot have ended yet.

53:47.999 --> 53:49.740
Where will you sleep\Nfor tonight?

53:49.740 --> 53:52.470
I should go sleep\Nat a nearby sauna.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.340
It might be uncomfortable.

53:54.340 --> 53:56.380
I'm a detective.\NI don't care.

53:56.380 --> 53:57.909
I can sleep anywhere.

54:02.519 --> 54:04.420
I should get a house soon.

54:04.690 --> 54:06.420
I stayed in that house\Nfor too long.

54:07.260 --> 54:10.490
Detective Ha.

54:11.289 --> 54:12.360
Detective Ha.

54:13.059 --> 54:14.260
- Hey.\N- What?

54:15.530 --> 54:17.229
You're here.

54:17.800 --> 54:18.970
How did you know\NI was here?

54:18.970 --> 54:21.440
You sent me\Na text message.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.769
You even sent me\Nits location too.

54:23.769 --> 54:25.869
(Joongjin 4-dong)

54:26.409 --> 54:27.610
I mean,\Nhow did you know...

54:27.610 --> 54:29.280
the exact sauna I was in?

54:30.449 --> 54:31.880
Take these shoes.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.479
Why didn't you\Ntake them with you?

54:42.019 --> 54:44.289
You wore them before.

54:44.289 --> 54:45.490
Don't you remember?

54:45.690 --> 54:47.530
They're all wet, goodness.

54:57.710 --> 54:59.010
They're the ones.

54:59.409 --> 55:01.909
Anyway, Kyung Mi shouldn't\Ntake the wrong idea.

55:03.210 --> 55:05.449
Are you that afraid of it?

55:06.479 --> 55:08.249
It's because\Nit's her house.

55:11.289 --> 55:12.420
What's that on your head?

55:12.420 --> 55:13.920
Shall we draw off\Nsome sweat?

55:15.190 --> 55:16.490
Let's do that.

55:37.309 --> 55:39.249
He visited this house\Nquite often.

55:40.579 --> 55:42.990
Why wouldn't they\Njust live together?

55:45.389 --> 55:47.920
I can catch culprits...

55:47.920 --> 55:49.289
and earn money also.

55:52.360 --> 55:53.929
I'm so excited\Njust by thinking of it.

55:54.630 --> 55:55.929
I can go right away\Ntomorrow...

55:55.929 --> 55:57.869
and apply for it to the\Npolice station, right?

55:58.099 --> 56:00.970
Make sure you go there\Nearly before it's closed.

56:05.070 --> 56:06.070
Lady.

56:06.809 --> 56:08.940
I won't be upset,\Nso tell me honestly.

56:08.940 --> 56:10.050
About what?

56:11.050 --> 56:12.249
Did you...

56:12.880 --> 56:14.280
sell off the ring because\Nyou needed money?

56:22.490 --> 56:23.530
Detective Ha,

56:24.590 --> 56:26.059
do you really\Nnot remember?

56:26.059 --> 56:27.900
I remember\Nthat I gave you the ring.

56:30.229 --> 56:32.470
You completely\Nblacked out, didn't you?

56:36.710 --> 56:39.539
I clearly saw it\Nwith my own eyes...

56:39.539 --> 56:41.440
that you gave it\Nto another woman.

56:41.840 --> 56:43.010
Who are you talking about?

56:43.010 --> 56:45.249
How would I know that?

56:46.550 --> 56:47.749
So you've...

56:48.479 --> 56:50.220
never received\Nany ring from me?

56:50.220 --> 56:51.449
And you've never...

56:52.990 --> 56:55.889
given any ring\Nto another woman?

56:57.960 --> 57:00.460
Let's go find the ring.

57:03.729 --> 57:06.400
Right, the answer is\Nalways at the scene.

57:08.699 --> 57:11.440
It's over here.

57:12.769 --> 57:14.539
Right, it's here.

57:19.920 --> 57:20.949
Is this it?

57:20.949 --> 57:22.679
No, it's there.

57:23.289 --> 57:24.349
Right.

57:24.349 --> 57:26.720
You sat here,\Nand I sat here.

57:26.720 --> 57:27.990
Right, it's here.

57:27.990 --> 57:29.690
And I made bomb shots.

57:29.690 --> 57:31.229
Right, you made\Na lot of them.

57:37.699 --> 57:38.699
That's right.

57:38.699 --> 57:40.699
You threw wet tissue.\NRight there.

57:42.400 --> 57:43.510
And...

57:45.240 --> 57:47.610
Beep, beep.

57:50.510 --> 57:52.110
We have eggs.

57:52.849 --> 57:53.849
Cheers.

57:56.490 --> 57:57.550
One more?

57:58.449 --> 58:00.619
Yes, you're good at\Nmixing liquor.

58:04.490 --> 58:05.490
Then...

58:06.130 --> 58:08.059
we just drank a lot.\NLike this.

58:08.059 --> 58:09.059
Stop.

58:09.570 --> 58:11.170
We're inspecting\Nthe scene right now.

58:22.139 --> 58:23.380
And then...

58:25.479 --> 58:26.880
I think\NI went to the restroom.

58:32.590 --> 58:34.190
I need to\Ngo to the restroom.

58:41.429 --> 58:42.429
Right.

58:42.860 --> 58:45.229
I remember taking out\Nthe ring to give to you.

58:53.579 --> 58:56.179
Lady. Wait right there.

58:58.079 --> 59:00.019
You are under arrest.

59:09.690 --> 59:11.260
See? I gave it to you.

59:11.490 --> 59:13.599
I don't remember\Ngetting anything.

59:17.229 --> 59:18.229
Cake.

59:18.869 --> 59:20.699
You said you wanted cake.

59:21.470 --> 59:22.470
- Cake?\N- Yes.

59:23.840 --> 59:25.240
Oh, I remember.

59:25.409 --> 59:26.880
Someone asked\Nif we had cake.

59:26.880 --> 59:27.880
My goodness.

59:28.110 --> 59:30.849
I think they asked\Nfor Mont Blanc.

59:31.079 --> 59:32.679
- Mont Blanc?\N- Mont Blanc?

59:32.920 --> 59:33.920
Yes.

59:40.220 --> 59:42.119
Can I have\Nsome Mont Blanc cake?

59:43.260 --> 59:45.190
We don't have any cake\Nfor bar snack.

59:45.190 --> 59:47.300
Then some\Ntiramisu, please.

59:47.729 --> 59:50.800
Oh, we don't have\Nany cake at all.

59:50.800 --> 59:51.829
Lady, are you drunk?

59:51.829 --> 59:54.570
You can't order cake\Nat a bar.

59:56.409 --> 59:57.710
Stop saying that,

59:58.670 --> 59:59.780
and sit right there.

01:00:00.979 --> 01:00:02.539
Come on, sit upright.

01:00:03.909 --> 01:00:04.979
I have...

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.420
I have something\Nto give to you.

01:00:14.019 --> 01:00:15.960
But I want some cake.

01:00:21.329 --> 01:00:22.429
Fine, then.

01:00:23.099 --> 01:00:24.400
Let's go get some cake.

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:31.539
If I wanted some cake...

01:00:33.679 --> 01:00:35.539
It's obvious. Right there.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:37.610
Genoise.

01:00:38.179 --> 01:00:39.550
I'm sure we went there.

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.630
The ring\Ndisappeared in there.

01:00:54.929 --> 01:00:56.769
And both of us...

01:00:56.970 --> 01:00:58.329
blacked out there too.

01:01:00.139 --> 01:01:01.139
Everything...

01:01:01.869 --> 01:01:03.269
has begun in there.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.429
(Queen of Mystery 2)

01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:30.929
I work here as of today.

01:01:30.929 --> 01:01:32.400
Sexual harassment?

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.970
I got harassed\Non my way to work.

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:37.710
I didn't see his face\Nbecause it was crowded.

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:40.179
No one cares enough\Nto do anything.

01:01:40.179 --> 01:01:42.809
This is why these things\Nkeep on happening.

01:01:43.679 --> 01:01:45.150
If the police\Ndoesn't catch them,

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:46.280
who will?

01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:49.280
This person got\Na surgery on their face.

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:50.820
Plastic surgery?

01:01:51.389 --> 01:01:53.559
Two people named\NSeo Hyun Soo have died.

01:01:53.559 --> 01:01:56.190
That means Seo Hyun Soo\Nwasn't just one person.
