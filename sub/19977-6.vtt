WEBVTT

00:10.574 --> 00:13.608
He's struck again, hasn't he?

00:13.710 --> 00:16.578
I received this by mail
with no return address.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.880
Apparently, it's a replica
of some statue

00:18.982 --> 00:21.383
located off the coast of New York City.

00:29.083 --> 00:30.783
Give me.

00:37.232 --> 00:39.032
Oh, that's him.

00:39.134 --> 00:41.669
Before I help you, I want to
hear how you're doing.

00:41.771 --> 00:43.637
I don't have time for
your nonsense today.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.172
Neither does Mr. Sniglet's next victim.

00:47.442 --> 00:49.375
I'm doing fine, okay?

00:55.283 --> 00:56.816
That won't do at all.

00:56.918 --> 00:58.951
I want to hear intimate,
personal things...

00:59.053 --> 01:01.420
things that may have
metaphorical parallels

01:01.522 --> 01:03.054
to the case.

01:04.391 --> 01:08.092
Well, I guess Geils and I broke up.

01:08.195 --> 01:09.661
Do you know that the rat and cheetah

01:09.763 --> 01:11.663
are the only animals
that don't fear intimacy?

01:11.765 --> 01:13.732
You have terrible trust issues,

01:13.834 --> 01:15.604
and they stem from your childhood.

01:15.605 --> 01:17.175
Tell me about Calvin Sniglet.

01:17.176 --> 01:20.538
Calvin Hobbes Sniglet is also
a product of his childhood.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.906
If he can't make peace with his past,

01:23.008 --> 01:24.975
he won't stop killing trophy hunters

01:25.077 --> 01:27.478
using their clothes
to make outfits for animals.

01:27.580 --> 01:30.914
When will you come to peace
with your past, Angela?

01:31.016 --> 01:33.384
You don't know anything about my past.

01:33.486 --> 01:36.152
I know that your father cared for your
stepmother more than he cared for you.

01:36.254 --> 01:39.208
What happened the night
of the eight-grade dance?

01:39.597 --> 01:40.863
You're crazy.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.859
You're just a crazy, old serial killer

01:42.961 --> 01:45.762
who will be pooping in a chrome
toilet for the rest of his life.

01:45.864 --> 01:50.066
I'd start checking police
bulletins for Manhattan.

01:50.168 --> 01:52.647
Yeah, I'll be sure to do that.

01:53.022 --> 01:54.483
Run along.

01:56.940 --> 01:58.674
Hey, do you guys validate?

01:58.776 --> 01:59.875
The first two hours are free.

01:59.977 --> 02:01.477
- Oh! Great.
- Yeah.

02:01.579 --> 02:02.774
- See ya.
- Bye.

02:05.314 --> 02:08.566
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

02:12.537 --> 02:14.756
Lieutenant, you left this on the door.

02:14.858 --> 02:17.692
Damn it, Tribeca.
This better be important.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.862
Wiedner, Tribeca. Tribeca, Wiedner.

02:20.963 --> 02:22.402
Wiedner, why don't you take a break.

02:22.403 --> 02:25.600
Tell Sergeant Gutierrez I said you
could fire that tear gas cannon.

02:25.709 --> 02:26.793
Okay.

02:28.578 --> 02:29.777
I need to go to New York City.

02:30.005 --> 02:32.171
Tribeca, every cop gets the Broadway bug

02:32.265 --> 02:33.253
at one point or another.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.941
But your name doesn't open a show,

02:35.043 --> 02:36.810
and you don't have the
legs for the chorus.

02:36.912 --> 02:38.712
A story just came off the New York wire

02:38.814 --> 02:40.346
about a missing middle-aged white man.

02:40.449 --> 02:42.416
I don't know if he's rich
or a trophy hunter,

02:42.518 --> 02:44.884
but it sure does sound like the
serial killer we've been tracking.

02:44.885 --> 02:47.386
If it doesn't happen in L.A.,
it's none of our business,

02:47.488 --> 02:50.989
and we don't know if serial
killing's illegal in New York.

02:51.091 --> 02:52.866
It's not that simple, Lieutenant.

02:52.913 --> 02:56.228
I am developing an obsessive
interest in this murderer,

02:56.330 --> 02:58.546
and I think he may be The One.

02:58.547 --> 03:01.866
Let me put this in the
plainest terms I can.

03:01.968 --> 03:03.735
Under no circumstances,

03:03.837 --> 03:06.203
no matter what persuasive
techniques are employed,

03:06.306 --> 03:08.807
even if our very lives depended on it,

03:08.909 --> 03:10.308
will I allow you to go to New York.

03:10.410 --> 03:13.277
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Lieutenant. Crystal.

03:14.147 --> 03:16.180
Oh, I have a volleyball
tournament tomorrow,

03:16.282 --> 03:17.519
- so I'm gonna need the day off.
- Fair enough.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.750
Also, Geils, Hoffman, and Tanner

03:19.852 --> 03:20.984
are bringing the snacks,

03:21.086 --> 03:24.020
and Scholls has the ball.

03:24.027 --> 03:26.261
Great! Good luck, Tribeca.

03:26.459 --> 03:27.201
Thanks.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.497
_

03:42.674 --> 03:44.574
I still feel guilty about this.

03:44.676 --> 03:48.377
I didn't hear you complaining
when we cut the security line.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.847
<i>Please do not leave your baggage</i>

03:51.949 --> 03:54.048
<i>or any of your belongings unattended.</i>

03:54.150 --> 03:56.317
<i>They will be confiscated.</i>

03:57.907 --> 03:58.854
I just hope you're right about this

03:58.956 --> 04:00.622
being the work of Calvin Sniglet

04:00.724 --> 04:03.525
because all of our careers
are on the line by being here.

04:03.627 --> 04:05.594
My gut is telling me it's Sniglet,

04:05.696 --> 04:06.962
and I can count on one hand

04:07.063 --> 04:09.429
the number of times my gut's been wrong.

04:09.532 --> 04:11.331
Oh! There she is.

04:11.433 --> 04:14.902
I called ahead to N.Y.P.D. They
sent a detective to come get us.

04:15.872 --> 04:18.539
Hi! Jessie Goldstein.
How are you? Come on in.

04:18.641 --> 04:20.240
Come on in. Thank you for
meeting us, Detective.

04:20.341 --> 04:23.176
Oh, please. It was my pleasure.

04:23.278 --> 04:26.412
Oh, you guys must be exhausted.

04:27.374 --> 04:28.810
All right, let's go!

04:31.786 --> 04:33.853
So, I don't know how much you've heard,

04:33.955 --> 04:36.022
but the disappearance of Anton Chekhov

04:36.124 --> 04:38.257
made me think that it could be
the work of a serial killer

04:38.359 --> 04:39.258
we've been tracking.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.894
What about it seemed similar?

04:40.996 --> 04:43.194
Well, the fact that a
white male was kidnapped,

04:43.296 --> 04:44.897
and I got this thing in the mail.

04:44.999 --> 04:47.432
- It's hard to explain.
- Okay.

04:47.535 --> 04:50.468
And here we are.

04:50.571 --> 04:52.571
Okay. Take care, now.

04:52.673 --> 04:55.440
Uh, Detective Goldstein, I don't
mean to be a backseat driver,

04:55.543 --> 04:57.643
but we're in the middle
of the Lincoln Tunnel.

05:00.146 --> 05:02.633
Oh, my God! You are so right.

05:02.711 --> 05:04.314
Now, get the [bleep] out of my car.

05:04.417 --> 05:05.950
Look, you think you can come to my city

05:06.052 --> 05:07.184
with your stupid L.A. clothes

05:07.286 --> 05:08.753
and your stupid Hollywood haircuts

05:08.855 --> 05:10.216
and tell me how to solve a case?

05:10.217 --> 05:11.889
Chekhov was Russian mob.

05:11.991 --> 05:14.025
This wasn't any serial killer.
This was a mob hit.

05:14.126 --> 05:16.626
So you can get your
[bleep] out of my car

05:16.728 --> 05:18.598
and get back to [bleep] Angeles.

05:19.359 --> 05:21.726
Go! Get out!

05:28.040 --> 05:30.840
So longs, jerks!

05:36.814 --> 05:39.481
Can you at least take us
back to the airport?

05:39.584 --> 05:42.384
Can you take us to the
end of the tunnel?

05:42.486 --> 05:44.585
Can you at least give us our clothes?

05:50.194 --> 05:52.060
Well, we didn't make it here,

05:52.161 --> 05:53.861
so I guess we can't make it anywhere.

05:53.885 --> 05:55.150
Hang on, guys.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.254
If I were the type of
person to give up easily,

05:57.467 --> 05:59.734
none of y'all would have
seen "The Good Wife."

05:59.836 --> 06:04.338
I know we're in an unfamiliar
city, we're cold, we're alone,

06:04.440 --> 06:07.541
but we're cops, and I have a hunch.

06:07.643 --> 06:09.076
Sure, it wasn't easy growing up

06:09.177 --> 06:10.310
with the kids teasing me about it,

06:10.412 --> 06:12.646
but it made me who I am today.

06:12.748 --> 06:16.361
So we're gonna go back to L.A.
with our tails between our legs?

06:17.586 --> 06:22.089
Or are we gonna take a big
breath of New York fresh air

06:22.190 --> 06:23.490
and get on with it?

06:25.000 --> 06:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:38.973 --> 06:40.439
Welcome to Louse House.

06:40.541 --> 06:42.974
We are not nice to lice. Can I help you?

06:43.076 --> 06:44.509
Tribeca and Geils, L.A.P.D.

06:44.611 --> 06:46.751
We'd like to speak to Masha Chekhov.

06:47.681 --> 06:51.049
I am Masha, Ms. Chekhov if you're nasty.

06:51.151 --> 06:52.517
Ma'am, I'm not sure if you're aware,

06:52.619 --> 06:54.352
but your husband went
missing a few days ago

06:54.454 --> 06:56.688
according to a missing-persons
report that you filed.

06:56.790 --> 07:00.557
I don't know anything about a
report, the police, or my husband.

07:01.253 --> 07:04.436
Russians are notoriously
suspicious of law enforcement.

07:16.307 --> 07:18.507
Please. Have a seat.

07:21.780 --> 07:24.446
Mm. My husband is good man.

07:24.549 --> 07:26.749
He just fall in with bad people.

07:26.851 --> 07:28.885
Eh, when you move here from Russia,

07:28.987 --> 07:30.687
you don't have choice of profession

07:30.789 --> 07:31.988
that you did in old country.

07:32.090 --> 07:34.422
I was Surgeon General of Volgograd,

07:34.524 --> 07:35.490
and look at me now.

07:35.592 --> 07:37.659
I'm nothing more than a nitpicker.

07:37.761 --> 07:40.261
- Irregardless...
- Regardless, eh?

07:40.363 --> 07:41.963
So you think the mob had something to do

07:42.066 --> 07:43.398
with your husband's disappearance?

07:43.500 --> 07:46.467
When did I say that? No.
All the mob love Anton.

07:46.570 --> 07:50.805
He always kill on time and
always come in under budget.

07:50.907 --> 07:53.340
Oh! You have lice.

07:53.442 --> 07:54.744
Next.

07:55.611 --> 07:58.713
Besides, Anton is dying of liver cancer.

07:58.815 --> 08:02.083
If someone wanted him
dead, why not just wait?

08:02.185 --> 08:04.952
Was your husband a big game
hunter, by any chance?

08:05.054 --> 08:07.620
No. Anton has very strict code.

08:07.723 --> 08:09.622
He only kill <i> people.</i>

08:09.725 --> 08:12.025
Oh! You also have lice!

08:12.127 --> 08:14.127
Hmm. Ooh, sorry!

08:14.229 --> 08:17.030
I accidentally grab
comb from dirty pile.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.535
Chekhov's not a trophy hunter,
he's not rich. It's not our guy.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.671
Let's just cut our losses
and get out of here.

08:26.773 --> 08:29.373
I'm telling you, Sniglet has Chekhov,

08:29.475 --> 08:30.875
and I'm not the only one who thinks so.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.510
Oh, don't tell me you've been
consulting with that maniac

08:33.611 --> 08:35.712
who's been in maximum-security
prison for 10 years.

08:35.714 --> 08:38.682
He has a name. It's the Zookeeper.

08:40.416 --> 08:42.982
Ladies, L.A.P.D. We're
gonna need your seats.

08:43.085 --> 08:45.619
We paid $4,000 for these.

08:51.327 --> 08:53.661
Oh, leave the M&Ms.

08:53.763 --> 08:55.728
You too, ma'am.

08:58.032 --> 09:01.434
There is a man missing,
and if leave New York now,

09:01.536 --> 09:04.437
he's gonna end up dead
and stripped of his clothes.

09:04.539 --> 09:07.621
You need to get this obsession you
have with Sniglet under control.

09:07.622 --> 09:09.241
I mean, what do you care?

09:09.243 --> 09:11.076
And this is not just about my career.

09:11.091 --> 09:12.490
Your ass is on the line, too.

09:12.733 --> 09:14.633
Look, I don't know
what you want me to say.

09:14.782 --> 09:16.849
There was a time when
my partner, Jay Geils,

09:16.951 --> 09:18.316
would have followed me anywhere.

09:18.318 --> 09:19.426
Yeah, well, your partner, Jay Geils,

09:19.427 --> 09:22.154
got to have sex and eat dinner with you.

09:23.362 --> 09:26.592
Let's see what Tanner and Hoffman
turn up at the taxi dispatch.

09:26.694 --> 09:28.959
If they come up empty, we'll go home.

09:33.933 --> 09:36.834
Oh, this is a singing play?

09:36.936 --> 09:38.669
I'll be in the lobby.

09:38.771 --> 09:42.264
So, Anton Chekhov was last
seen getting into one of your cabs.

09:42.265 --> 09:45.318
I told you, we found the
cab abandoned out in Queens.

09:45.319 --> 09:47.110
- Anyone in it?
- Oh, yeah.

09:47.212 --> 09:50.514
It's the kind of abandoned car
that had nine people in it.

09:50.616 --> 09:52.849
So you haven't heard from the driver?

09:52.951 --> 09:54.328
I didn't tell ya?

09:54.373 --> 09:56.679
Right after he ditched the car
in the middle of nowhere,

09:56.822 --> 09:58.822
we went out and got
bananas splits together.

09:58.924 --> 10:00.801
All right, sir. Well,
we're gonna need statements

10:00.802 --> 10:02.982
from all nine people
that was inside that car

10:02.983 --> 10:05.346
<i>and</i> the name of the ice cream place.

10:09.133 --> 10:12.701
Thanks for coming to New York
on short notice, Dr. Scholls.

10:12.803 --> 10:15.370
I wanted to try my new bicycle anyway.

10:15.372 --> 10:16.906
Anything turn up in the cab?

10:16.997 --> 10:18.330
I found some fingerprints on the wheel,

10:18.332 --> 10:20.130
which I'm checking against the database.

10:20.169 --> 10:22.720
There were two wool fibers
in the backseat... and this.

10:24.196 --> 10:26.247
This is the original driver of the cab.

10:26.349 --> 10:29.017
Sir, would you mind
handing me that button?

10:29.981 --> 10:31.681
Thank you, sir.

10:31.784 --> 10:32.533
Mind fingers.

10:33.533 --> 10:34.970
According to the missing-persons report,

10:34.971 --> 10:37.871
Anton Chekhov was wearing an
overcoat with this type of button.

10:37.973 --> 10:40.373
So Chekhov <i> was</i> in the car.

10:40.476 --> 10:42.042
But who took him?

10:42.144 --> 10:45.312
The fingerprints match those we
have on file for Calvin Sniglet.

10:45.414 --> 10:47.414
Tribeca was right!

10:47.516 --> 10:50.451
Wait a minute. I thought he
only killed trophy hunters.

10:50.553 --> 10:53.686
Well, that explains this.
Rhino horn powder.

10:53.788 --> 10:57.089
The Chinese use it to treat
cancer and make fireworks.

10:58.192 --> 10:59.826
"Take twice a day for liver cancer

10:59.928 --> 11:02.246
or throw in the air on New Year's Eve."

11:04.766 --> 11:06.265
Thanks, Tanner.

11:06.367 --> 11:07.867
Okay, it's him. He's here.

11:07.969 --> 11:11.235
He took Chekhov, who was taking
rhino horn for his cancer.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.372
Wow. You called it. Let's rock and roll.

11:14.475 --> 11:17.241
Hey, Babe, where's
the lieutenant's office?

11:21.081 --> 11:22.840
Excuse me, Lieutenant?

11:24.084 --> 11:26.184
Paddy Atkins, N.Y.P.D.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.885
Jay Geils.

11:27.987 --> 11:29.653
Angie Tribeca. L.A.P.D.

11:29.755 --> 11:32.055
L.A.P.D. I have a cousin
that works in the L.A.P.D.

11:32.157 --> 11:33.991
- Pritikin Atkins?
- It's a pretty big force.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.426
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- Well, a cop's a cop.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.696
So, what can New York's
finest do you for?

11:38.798 --> 11:39.864
Well, we're fairly sure

11:39.966 --> 11:41.665
that a serial killer
named Calvin Sniglet

11:41.767 --> 11:44.334
is responsible for the
disappearance of Anton Chekhov.

11:44.436 --> 11:46.703
I thought I smelled
quinoa and tanning spray.

11:46.805 --> 11:48.995
Lieutenant, Chekhov was a mob hit.

11:48.996 --> 11:51.374
I've already rounded up
the usual suspects.

11:51.483 --> 11:53.216
It's just garbage killing garbage.

11:53.217 --> 11:55.044
I respectfully disagree, sir.

11:55.146 --> 11:58.258
We found Sniglet's prints in
the taxi Chekhov was riding in.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.417
This isn't one of your big
Hollywood movies, Tribeca.

12:01.519 --> 12:03.251
This is New York City,
where they've shot

12:03.353 --> 12:05.286
over 400 episodes of "Law and Order."

12:05.389 --> 12:07.990
Now, then, Goldstein, you're gonna help
these detectives follow their lead.

12:08.091 --> 12:09.901
You're also gonna put
them up in your apartment.

12:09.903 --> 12:10.566
Lieutenant...

12:10.566 --> 12:12.828
You have the most space since
Cappelli sold his one-bedroom.

12:12.930 --> 12:15.163
Now, I don't want to
hear another word about it.

12:15.265 --> 12:16.698
But I warn you, detectives.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.566
We don't take too kindly
to having our chains yanked

12:18.668 --> 12:21.068
by a bunch of fancy
West Coast chain yankers.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.316
Morning, sleepyhead.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.286
Coffee is on the toilet
if you need some.

13:17.427 --> 13:18.820
Where's Tribeca?

13:18.922 --> 13:22.124
Oh, Tribeca and Goldstein
were both gone when I woke up.

13:31.835 --> 13:34.303
Thank you for seeing me,
Mr. and Mrs. Sniglet.

13:34.405 --> 13:36.370
I won't take too much of your time.

13:36.473 --> 13:38.234
When was the last time you saw your son?

13:38.289 --> 13:40.274
Oh, he was here for Christmas.

13:40.376 --> 13:43.144
We had a nice dinner. Vegan, of course.

13:43.246 --> 13:45.216
He won't eat anything with a face.

13:45.681 --> 13:48.782
Thank you for also seeing me,
Mr. and Mrs. Sniglet.

13:48.884 --> 13:50.408
I won't take too much of your time,

13:50.409 --> 13:52.848
but when was the last
time you saw you son?

13:52.849 --> 13:54.345
Oh, he was here for Christmas.

13:54.346 --> 13:56.656
We had a nice dinner. Vegan, of course.

13:56.758 --> 13:58.891
He won't eat anything with a face.

13:58.994 --> 14:01.661
I actually thought it was pretty rude

14:01.763 --> 14:04.197
that he wouldn't try my
world-famous hog's face.

14:04.299 --> 14:07.379
Oh, come on!
Can't you two get past this?

14:08.003 --> 14:11.270
Martha's Calvin's stepmother,
and as you can I see,

14:11.372 --> 14:13.731
they haven't always seen eye to eye.

14:16.076 --> 14:18.444
Martha's Calvin's step-mom,
and as you can I see,

14:18.446 --> 14:20.212
they haven't always seen eye to eye.

14:20.233 --> 14:22.367
So, there was some tension there?

14:22.556 --> 14:24.656
Calvin's mom,
the first Mrs. Sniglet, uh,

14:24.780 --> 14:27.113
she died when he was 6 years old.

14:27.287 --> 14:31.298
They were very close.
They shared a love of animals.

14:33.460 --> 14:34.825
That was for the both of you.

14:34.927 --> 14:36.911
Thank you so much for your time.

14:36.958 --> 14:38.640
I'd really like to talk to your son.

14:38.641 --> 14:40.241
Do you have any idea where he could be?

14:40.311 --> 14:43.400
Oh, sorry, no. He moves around a lot.

14:43.502 --> 14:46.036
He usually just gets in contact with us.

14:46.138 --> 14:49.839
Well, if you do hear from him,
please have him give me a call.

14:49.941 --> 14:53.009
Yes, I will, uh,
Detective Angie Tribeca.

14:53.111 --> 14:54.322
Mm-hmm.

14:59.151 --> 15:00.583
What's your deal, Goldstein?

15:00.685 --> 15:02.652
Why don't you just stick
to your mob hit theory

15:02.753 --> 15:04.654
and stay out of my investigation?

15:04.755 --> 15:06.556
I'm starting to like your theory.

15:06.658 --> 15:08.224
You don't even know my theory.

15:08.326 --> 15:09.425
You just like it 'cause I like it.

15:09.527 --> 15:10.759
Ain't no cuff on that wrist,

15:10.861 --> 15:13.396
so until there's an arrest,
it's fair game.

15:15.766 --> 15:18.366
Tribeca. Oh, hey. This is Larry Sniglet.

15:18.468 --> 15:22.571
Calvin's dad. Oh. Hi, Dr. Cannoli.

15:22.673 --> 15:24.372
It's my gynecologist.

15:24.374 --> 15:26.508
Look, uh, Calvin's a good kid.

15:26.522 --> 15:29.123
He just likes to kill people.

15:29.292 --> 15:31.525
You see, he was bullied
most of his life,

15:31.627 --> 15:33.394
even when we home-schooled him.

15:33.496 --> 15:36.046
Well, I guess that kind of
pounding takes it toll.

15:36.465 --> 15:39.031
Anyway, you might want to
look in Central Park.

15:39.134 --> 15:43.403
He loved to sit on this bench
just south of Strawberry Fields

15:43.505 --> 15:46.473
and feed the stray cats.

15:46.575 --> 15:48.341
Anywhere else besides the pussy area?

15:48.443 --> 15:50.810
Oh, no. That's where he liked to go.

15:50.912 --> 15:54.480
But the park is locked at night,
so you might have to sneak in.

15:54.582 --> 15:56.648
I'll see if I have any luck
with the back entrance.

15:56.750 --> 16:00.419
Oh, but be careful because
the gate will lock after you.

16:00.521 --> 16:02.221
I'll just jam something in there.

16:02.323 --> 16:03.788
Thank you, Doctor.

16:05.993 --> 16:07.504
I have the same thing.

16:11.777 --> 16:13.177
We have to get to Central Park.

16:13.279 --> 16:14.611
We'll fan out, we'll...

16:14.713 --> 16:16.413
What's wrong with everybody?

16:19.672 --> 16:21.599
Hello, Lieutenant.

16:21.658 --> 16:22.752
How was the volleyball tournament?

16:22.854 --> 16:25.389
- Great. We won.
- Congratulations.

16:25.972 --> 16:28.871
Unfortunately, an earthquake has
totally wiped out Los Angeles,

16:28.871 --> 16:31.488
and we need every first
responder we can get.

16:31.902 --> 16:32.961
Let's move.

16:33.928 --> 16:36.098
Good to see you, Paddy.

16:38.096 --> 16:40.336
And nice to see you, as well, Pritikin.

16:40.438 --> 16:42.505
All right, thank you.

16:42.607 --> 16:44.073
I know where to find him.

16:44.175 --> 16:45.773
Then why are you telling me?

16:45.875 --> 16:47.175
'Cause you're all I've got.

16:47.844 --> 16:50.011
Also, I don't know how
to get to Central Park.

16:52.749 --> 16:55.016
You're a great detective, Tribeca.

16:55.118 --> 16:57.721
Maybe you Hollywood types
are not so bad after all.

16:57.729 --> 17:00.934
Thank you. I still find you
New Yorkers pretty abrasive.

17:03.477 --> 17:05.025
Where'd you get that?

17:05.127 --> 17:07.861
I have no idea.
It just came in the mail.

17:07.963 --> 17:10.085
It's a replica of a statue
in the New York Harbor.

17:10.086 --> 17:12.003
I'll explain on the way. Let's go.

17:16.542 --> 17:18.960
Nothing yet. Are you in position?

17:18.962 --> 17:20.328
Look how high the crown is!

17:20.329 --> 17:21.602
I like the torch!

17:22.578 --> 17:24.544
Yeah. Nothing here, either.

17:24.645 --> 17:26.411
Hang on, I'm getting a call.

17:26.513 --> 17:27.306
Tribeca.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.174
Looking for someone?

17:29.175 --> 17:30.494
Sniglet. Where are you?

17:30.495 --> 17:33.252
Oh, I'm around somewhere.

17:38.771 --> 17:42.299
But am I around you or
around Detective Goldstein?

17:42.300 --> 17:44.311
- Where's Chekhov?
- Chekhov?

17:44.312 --> 17:46.283
Oh, you mean the human.

17:46.330 --> 17:49.229
I've released him into the wild
so that I could hunt him.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.057
It's only fair, after all.

17:51.058 --> 17:53.343
Who do you think's gonna find him first?

17:53.344 --> 17:56.889
Okay, look. I know your
upbringing wasn't that great.

17:57.115 --> 17:58.653
How do you know that?

17:58.654 --> 18:01.119
Because I spoke to your dad
and your step-mom.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.767
You mean the Wicked Witch
of the West Village?

18:03.768 --> 18:05.364
I know she was kind of a B to you.

18:05.365 --> 18:07.609
Oh, she was more than a B.

18:07.610 --> 18:09.353
She was an FB.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.120
Look, you should have seen my step-mom.

18:11.221 --> 18:12.888
I used to call her Voldemom.

18:12.990 --> 18:15.957
Wait, didn't you grow up
before Harry Potter came out?

18:16.060 --> 18:17.458
Yeah, huge coincidence.

18:17.561 --> 18:19.861
Anyway, what I'm saying is I understand,

18:19.963 --> 18:22.164
but you can't take your
crap out on everybody,

18:22.265 --> 18:23.765
because it doesn't change anything.

18:23.867 --> 18:26.935
Trust me... I've been taking out
my past on just about everybody,

18:27.037 --> 18:29.269
and I am the least
popular person at work.

18:29.371 --> 18:31.572
Seems like we're not
so different, Tribeca.

18:31.674 --> 18:34.199
Maybe you'll get lucky
and find Chekhov first.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.687
Oh, wait... Never mind. There he is.

18:36.688 --> 18:38.179
Sniglet, don't.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.850
Chekhov's here. I see him.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.485
Sniglet?

18:46.588 --> 18:48.287
Too late.

18:56.811 --> 18:58.898
Uh, Tribeca?

19:01.502 --> 19:03.602
- Thanks for the ride.
- That was kind of a weird one.

19:03.704 --> 19:05.570
Yeah, they all are these days.

19:05.672 --> 19:10.142
Well, if it's any consolation,
Chekhov wasn't such a great guy.

19:11.011 --> 19:13.678
But that's not really
what's bothering you, is it?

19:15.582 --> 19:17.616
I'm taking your father to the dance.

19:17.718 --> 19:19.617
It's a father-daughter dance!

19:19.719 --> 19:22.253
Maybe if you were prettier,
he would have taken you.

19:22.355 --> 19:23.264
Dad!

19:23.266 --> 19:25.991
You know how jealous
your stepmother gets.

19:26.092 --> 19:27.625
Let me take her to the dance,

19:27.727 --> 19:29.493
and I'll make it up to you later.

19:29.595 --> 19:32.897
You wanted to go to that
cop convention next weekend.

19:35.334 --> 19:37.500
Sniglet is trying to protect animals

19:37.602 --> 19:40.203
because he sees them as vulnerable,

19:40.305 --> 19:42.857
like he was when I was a child.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.112
Take it easy, Goldstein.

19:49.214 --> 19:53.149
All right, you too.
Hmm. Why is my head so itchy?

19:53.251 --> 19:55.785
- I got to go. Bye.
- Okay. See ya!

20:02.208 --> 20:05.301
_

20:06.798 --> 20:07.874
Hey, Dad.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.962
I was hoping to talk to you.

20:21.422 --> 20:23.729
