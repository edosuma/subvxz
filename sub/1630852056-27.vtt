WEBVTT

00:00.367 --> 00:02.433
-Were you living together?
-Yes.

00:02.500 --> 00:04.000
I had left the situation

00:04.066 --> 00:06.266
because I had found out
that she was cheating on me.

00:06.333 --> 00:08.233
So then, I'm screaming at him,

00:08.300 --> 00:10.934
and then he goes outside
and calls the cops

00:11.000 --> 00:14.200
because he said that he was
"threatened for his life."

00:14.266 --> 00:17.333
Grow up. Grow up.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.000
[Narrator]
<i>This is </i>Judy Justice.

00:21.066 --> 00:24.166
[dramatic music]

00:36.934 --> 00:39.567
<i>Austin Nelson is suing his ex-girlfriend,</i>

00:39.633 --> 00:43.300
<i>Rebecca Westrum for the cost of a car.</i>

00:43.367 --> 00:45.367
[Kevin] Court, come to order.
All rise.

00:47.567 --> 00:49.667
Be seated, please.

00:49.734 --> 00:51.133
[Kevin] Hello, Judge.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.467
Case 10-29,
Nelson versus Westrum.

00:53.533 --> 00:54.934
-Thank you, Kevin.
-You're welcome.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.200
Mr. Nelson, how long
were you and Miss Westrum

00:58.266 --> 01:00.367
involved in a dating relationship?

01:00.433 --> 01:02.000
Let's say,
about three years on and off.

01:02.066 --> 01:03.300
Did you ever live together?

01:03.367 --> 01:06.433
Uh, yes, at one point.
We did at two occasions.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.934
The last time that you were
involved with each other,

01:10.000 --> 01:11.400
were you living together?

01:11.467 --> 01:12.934
-[Austin] Yes.
-[Judy] And where was that?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.233
That was at her mom's house.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.100
So, you were living
at her mother's house?

01:16.166 --> 01:17.066
Correct.

01:17.133 --> 01:19.367
And from when to when were
you living at her mother's house?

01:19.433 --> 01:24.600
I would say roughly
about October-ish to...

01:24.667 --> 01:27.333
it'd be, uh, let's say, April.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.266
October of 2020?

01:29.333 --> 01:31.266
-[Austin] Yes.
-[Judy] To April of 2021?

01:31.333 --> 01:33.000
-Correct.
-Were you working?

01:33.066 --> 01:34.066
Uh, off and on.

01:34.133 --> 01:35.567
Were you paying her mother any rent?

01:35.633 --> 01:38.100
I was, between me and Rebecca.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.233
How much were you paying?

01:39.300 --> 01:40.433
[Austin] I'd pay 200.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.500
-[Judy] A month?
-Yes.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.767
And was Rebecca paying rent?

01:43.834 --> 01:46.367
-Yes.
-[Judy] Did you pay rent every month?

01:46.433 --> 01:47.467
I tried to, yes.

01:47.533 --> 01:48.867
[Judy] "Tried to" is not an answer.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.667
I, uh, did as best as I could.

01:50.734 --> 01:52.467
And if I couldn't make it,
I talked to Rebecca

01:52.533 --> 01:53.734
and seeing that if she's...

01:53.800 --> 01:55.934
So, the answer is,
you didn't pay her every month?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.333
-Correct.
-[Judy] That's easy.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.834
Rebecca had an old car
that you drove around in.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.266
Her mom got her another car.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.967
And according to the complaint
that you filed,

02:06.033 --> 02:09.433
when the two of you broke up,
you left her mother's house.

02:09.500 --> 02:13.333
You didn't expect her to leave
her mother's house, so you left.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.533
And on what date in April
did that happen?

02:16.600 --> 02:18.133
That'd be the 8th.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.367
-[Judy] Eighth?
-Yes.

02:19.433 --> 02:23.033
And that's, I sort of,
from reading between the lines

02:23.100 --> 02:26.133
in this complaint,
I gathered that there was

02:26.200 --> 02:30.166
some heated discussion
about you taking the car with you.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.166
Correct.

02:31.233 --> 02:32.467
I want you to tell me about that.

02:32.533 --> 02:35.066
I have, uh, a signed title stating...

02:35.133 --> 02:37.166
No, no, no,
you're leaving the house.

02:37.233 --> 02:39.633
And it's not a harmonious breakup.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.967
It's an, sort of an acrimonious breakup.

02:42.033 --> 02:44.433
She has a car that's in her name.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.300
She told you to go,
or you said, "I'm going."

02:47.367 --> 02:48.900
You wanted to take the car.

02:48.967 --> 02:50.834
She didn't want you to take the car.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.967
So far, does that sound right to you?

02:53.033 --> 02:54.200
No, Your Honor.

02:54.266 --> 02:55.967
Then you tell me
what happened with the car

02:56.033 --> 02:57.033
when you were leaving?

02:57.100 --> 02:58.500
I had left the situation

02:58.567 --> 03:00.500
because I had found out
that she was cheating on me.

03:00.567 --> 03:01.500
And?

03:01.567 --> 03:05.233
And I had asked her to sign the title
because she had told me

03:05.300 --> 03:06.867
that she was going to
give it to me anyway.

03:06.934 --> 03:07.934
-I just didn't...
-Okay.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.166
So when she told you
she was going to give it to you...

03:11.233 --> 03:14.600
-was that before you separated in April?
-Yes.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.100
Did she ever give it to you?

03:16.166 --> 03:18.000
I was driving it, uh, through the title.

03:18.066 --> 03:19.233
No, no. Well, you were driving it.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.533
You were driving her car.
So, when you were together,

03:21.600 --> 03:23.033
she said, "I'll give you the car."

03:23.100 --> 03:24.100
Yes, Your Honor.

03:24.166 --> 03:26.033
Did you ever take any action on that?

03:26.100 --> 03:27.967
Like transferring it to your name,

03:28.033 --> 03:31.166
getting the title, getting insurance,
anything else?

03:31.233 --> 03:32.667
I could not, due to COVID.

03:32.734 --> 03:36.200
I just had, in our town, we just
had an outside window open.

03:36.266 --> 03:37.533
So, therefore, after the breakup,

03:37.600 --> 03:39.633
I could not get the title into my name.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.500
[Judy] Just a second.
Did you get insurance on the car?

03:42.567 --> 03:46.166
I, uh, to be honest, I thought there
was insurance still on the vehicle.

03:46.233 --> 03:47.667
Well, then it wasn't your insurance.

03:47.734 --> 03:50.200
So, what did you do?
You just drove it?

03:50.266 --> 03:54.033
I asked you, I'm going back.
You're leaving the house.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.133
You wanted to take the car.
If she gave you the car,

03:57.200 --> 03:58.333
there wouldn't have been an issue,

03:58.400 --> 04:01.667
but it is my understanding
that the police were called.

04:01.734 --> 04:02.967
Yes, Your Honor.

04:03.033 --> 04:06.033
Well, so if the police were called,
someone wasn't happy.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.166
Who called the police?

04:07.233 --> 04:08.233
I did, Your Honor.

04:08.300 --> 04:11.533
And when you called the police,
what was your complaint?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.767
That I needed help,
assistance for removing...

04:13.834 --> 04:15.734
-[Judy] For what?
-My stuff out of the house.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.367
-Your stuff, or the car?
-The stuff.

04:18.433 --> 04:19.867
-So, did you get the stuff?
-Yes.

04:19.934 --> 04:23.967
And what happened with the car
when the police were there?

04:24.033 --> 04:25.500
Well, I had the signed title, and they...

04:25.567 --> 04:28.200
No, no, no.
When had she signed the title?

04:28.266 --> 04:29.266
That same day.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.567
When the police were there?

04:30.633 --> 04:32.133
Before the police had arrived.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.433
Explain it to me.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.400
I had grabbed it out of the drawer,
asked her to sign it.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.400
[Judy] Just a second.
Just a second.

04:37.467 --> 04:40.500
-When you were arguing...?
-Yes.

04:40.567 --> 04:44.266
You grabbed the title
out of what drawer?

04:44.333 --> 04:45.467
The bottom drawer in her room.

04:45.533 --> 04:48.467
Okay. And why did you
grab the title out?

04:48.533 --> 04:51.166
Because she had sworn
that it was my car.

04:51.233 --> 04:53.100
She had sworn.
Tell me how she's...?

04:53.166 --> 04:55.066
Is this yours?

04:55.133 --> 04:56.033
No.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.200
How are you related to him?

04:58.266 --> 04:59.533
I am just a friend.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.266
So, you grabbed the title
out of the drawer and...?

05:02.333 --> 05:03.900
I asked her to politely sign it.

05:03.967 --> 05:04.967
She signed it.

05:05.033 --> 05:06.934
No. How did you ask her polite...?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.033
You grabbed it
out of the drawer and said...?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.233
Can you please sign this?

05:11.300 --> 05:12.400
I'm leaving. I'm done.

05:12.467 --> 05:15.100
-That is not what you said.
-[Judy] Shhh.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.533
[bangs on table]

05:17.734 --> 05:21.467
So, what you said to her is,
would you please sign it?

05:21.533 --> 05:23.600
This? I'm leaving. I'm done.

05:23.667 --> 05:26.166
-Yes, Your Honor.
-[Judy] And she got a pen and signed it.

05:26.233 --> 05:27.333
I had already had the pen.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.767
So, you had a pen.

05:28.834 --> 05:31.100
-You gave it to her, and she signed it.
-Yes, Your Honor.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.500
Stop right there.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.100
He's leaving.

05:36.166 --> 05:39.500
Tell me how the title
got signed over to him?

05:39.567 --> 05:41.533
So, I was sleeping for work

05:41.600 --> 05:44.433
the day that he wanted to leave.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.033
Him saying that I cheated on him

05:46.100 --> 05:48.000
was not accurate, whatsoever.

05:48.066 --> 05:49.700
He went through my phone,
and I was texting my friends,

05:49.767 --> 05:51.433
and me and my friends,
we always joke around,

05:51.500 --> 05:53.066
texting each other the way we did.

05:53.133 --> 05:54.867
You don't have to
explain yourself to me.

05:54.934 --> 05:58.266
[laughs] And, um,
he got really angry with me

05:58.333 --> 05:59.367
while I was sleeping.

05:59.433 --> 06:01.800
So, he ripped my blanket off of me,

06:01.867 --> 06:04.133
flipped me over
and was yelling at me saying,

06:04.200 --> 06:06.367
"Sign the... title, sign the title."

06:06.433 --> 06:07.967
And then he smacked the pillow

06:08.033 --> 06:10.367
when I told him
I was not going to sign the title.

06:10.433 --> 06:11.667
So, I signed the title

06:11.734 --> 06:14.400
just because I didn't want
anything bad to happen to me.

06:14.467 --> 06:15.467
And then what happened?

06:15.533 --> 06:18.667
So then, I'm screaming at him.
He's screaming at me.

06:18.734 --> 06:21.333
And then he goes outside
and calls the cops

06:21.400 --> 06:24.600
because he said that he was
"threatened for his life"

06:24.667 --> 06:26.700
when it was just me in the house.

06:26.767 --> 06:29.500
Can I see the police report
that looks like a police report?

06:29.567 --> 06:31.100
Uh, I don't have the police report.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.633
Does anybody have a police report?

06:32.700 --> 06:33.700
I have a police report
of her stating when...

06:33.767 --> 06:35.300
[Judy] I'd like to take a look.

06:35.367 --> 06:37.200
-...she showed up to my house.
-No, no, no, chup.

06:37.266 --> 06:40.567
Does anybody have a police
report for April 8th?

06:40.633 --> 06:42.300
-No.
-No. Okay.

06:42.367 --> 06:44.700
Now, now you have the car
on April 8th,

06:44.767 --> 06:47.967
and you have a title,
and you're driving around

06:48.033 --> 06:50.333
in the car that you believe is yours?

06:50.400 --> 06:51.400
Yes, Your Honor.

06:51.467 --> 06:54.233
When did you finally
get stopped at this park

06:54.300 --> 06:56.333
that you got stopped in,
according to you?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.266
-That would be...
-What month?

06:58.333 --> 07:00.700
It would've been last month, July.

07:00.767 --> 07:01.767
That's about three months later.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.066
-Yes.
-[Judy] Did you have insurance?

07:04.133 --> 07:05.166
No, not that I knew.

07:05.233 --> 07:07.300
Oh, I guess no,
because the officer told me

07:07.367 --> 07:08.834
that there was no insurance on the car.

07:08.900 --> 07:11.867
I have the police report
from the day that he got pulled over.

07:11.934 --> 07:13.967
What date was that?

07:14.033 --> 07:18.600
It would have been
7/14/2021 at 1:06 a.m.

07:18.667 --> 07:20.300
-One o' six?
-[Rebecca] Mm-mm.

07:20.367 --> 07:22.266
May I see it, please?

07:32.233 --> 07:35.633
So, they stopped you
for not having the seatbelt on?

07:35.700 --> 07:39.633
No, they stopped me because I was
in park curfew to pass, uh...

07:39.700 --> 07:42.100
Hold on. So, not only
didn't you have insurance,

07:42.166 --> 07:44.400
but you didn't have
a valid driver's license.

07:44.467 --> 07:45.700
-Uh-uh.
-[Judy] Uh...

07:45.767 --> 07:48.533
[clears throat]
So, I'm from Wisconsin.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.700
So, I have a Wisconsin ID.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.567
The officer had told me that the I'd...

07:51.633 --> 07:55.066
Don't tell me what the officer told you.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.400
I read the police report.

07:57.467 --> 08:00.567
It said that you had a suspended
driver's license.

08:00.633 --> 08:02.467
-No.
-Okay. Here we go.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.133
-[Austin] It's-it's, it's a...
-Here we go.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.400
It's not-it's not suspended.
It is, um...

08:07.467 --> 08:09.367
-Revoked?
-No, um...

08:09.433 --> 08:12.900
[laughter]

08:12.967 --> 08:14.700
-What?
-Yes, expired.

08:14.767 --> 08:18.667
"A revoked driving status"
is what it says here.

08:18.734 --> 08:20.333
Yeah, but that's not true.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.600
It's not true. It's a lie.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.967
The DVS results showed Austin

08:24.033 --> 08:26.633
has a suspended driver's license,

08:26.700 --> 08:29.467
and eligible for a license.

08:29.533 --> 08:32.033
But you advised the police
immediately when you stopped

08:32.100 --> 08:34.333
that you didn't have
insurance on the car.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.433
No. I said I wasn't too sure,
and I pulled up the phone...

08:36.500 --> 08:38.467
No, you said you didn't have insurance.

08:38.533 --> 08:42.266
And you managed to get insurance
on the car at the scene

08:42.333 --> 08:45.033
through Progressive on a telephone call.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.300
You called somebody to come
and pick you up

08:47.367 --> 08:49.700
because you didn't have
a valid driver's license,

08:49.767 --> 08:52.133
and that the officer
wasn't going to let you leave

08:52.200 --> 08:55.266
in the car driving.
That sound right?

08:55.333 --> 08:56.467
Yes, Your Honor.

08:56.533 --> 08:58.433
Why would you come here
and make a fool of yourself?

08:58.500 --> 08:59.633
[dramatic music]

08:59.700 --> 09:04.200
Why would you need to transfer
a title when you can't drive it?

09:04.266 --> 09:06.367
I could have used it for other--

09:06.433 --> 09:09.133
other people could have used it.
They could have insured it.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.333
[laughs] You're an idiot.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.233
[Narrator] <i>Later...</i>

09:12.300 --> 09:15.700
All I want to know is
what you said to her about

09:15.767 --> 09:19.800
"I'm making good on the 50 dollars
by buying drinks and food?"

09:19.867 --> 09:21.333
I'm going to get you a few drinks,

09:21.400 --> 09:22.767
and then I bought lunch for everyone.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.300
Who cares?

09:27.467 --> 09:30.166
[dramatic music]

09:33.600 --> 09:36.600
[Narrator] <i>Austin Nelson</i>
<i>claims his ex-girlfriend,</i>

09:36.667 --> 09:40.166
<i>Rebecca Westrum owes him</i>

09:40.233 --> 09:41.934
<i>Rebecca is countersuing,</i>

09:42.000 --> 09:45.667
<i>claiming Austin needs</i>
<i>to pay for the car or return it to her.</i>

09:45.734 --> 09:48.300
Okay. Why would you come here
and make a fool of yourself?

09:48.367 --> 09:49.367
[laughter]

09:49.433 --> 09:50.567
For what reason?

09:50.633 --> 09:51.467
Trying to fight for what's right.

09:51.533 --> 09:55.300
Nah, you can't come here
driving around in a car, sir,

09:55.367 --> 09:57.333
when you don't have
a driver's license,

09:57.400 --> 09:59.800
and you knew
the car was uninsured.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.000
And knowing that,
and knowing that you didn't

10:02.066 --> 10:03.800
transfer a title, whether--

10:03.867 --> 10:05.133
I don't even have to get to the point

10:05.200 --> 10:07.567
whether she'd signed it
because you were angry with her,

10:07.633 --> 10:09.200
and she was afraid not to sign it.

10:09.266 --> 10:11.133
Clearly, there was a disagreement

10:11.200 --> 10:13.266
that might require
the police to be called.

10:13.333 --> 10:17.400
But you can't come to a court
with dirty hands and say,

10:17.467 --> 10:20.200
now I want you to help me
get my car back.

10:20.266 --> 10:25.667
Well, the value of it was a-- 500 dollar,
she said you were supposed to give her

10:25.734 --> 10:28.166
500 dollars for the car,
and you never did.

10:28.233 --> 10:29.900
-No.
-That's what her counter claim is.

10:29.967 --> 10:31.266
-There was no agreement.
-Where is the car now?

10:31.333 --> 10:33.100
-Where is the car now?
-It is at my house.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.400
Okay, she's gonna come and pick it up.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.600
Well, thing is, okay, so,

10:36.667 --> 10:39.467
for her, for, okay,
so I did try to get the title signed.

10:39.533 --> 10:42.700
She gave me 24 hours when the cops
did come to my house the first time.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.166
Therefore, I did not have 24 hours.

10:45.233 --> 10:47.500
She had went to go get a duplicate title.

10:47.567 --> 10:49.400
[overlapping conversation]

10:49.467 --> 10:51.100
-She has to...
-She's getting the car back.

10:51.166 --> 10:53.934
She's getting the car back.
You did nothing for this car, nothing.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.233
The only thing that you did
was drive around in it

10:56.300 --> 10:59.200
without a driver's license,
and no insurance.

10:59.266 --> 11:03.367
And you hadn't had
the car transferred to your name,

11:03.433 --> 11:08.200
if you in fact thought that you had
a valid transfer, for three months.

11:08.266 --> 11:10.100
And if you had gotten into an accident,

11:10.166 --> 11:13.266
I don't know whether your mother
owns her home or rents it.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.333
She rents it.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.600
-I rent it.
-[Judy] You rent it.

11:15.667 --> 11:17.000
Do you have a car?

11:17.066 --> 11:18.000
I do.

11:18.066 --> 11:19.266
They could have taken her car away.

11:19.333 --> 11:20.667
They could have garnished her salary,

11:20.734 --> 11:24.066
her mother's salary if they're employed,
all of those things,

11:24.133 --> 11:26.133
because you didn't get her car insured.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.967
They were still responsible.
She was still responsible.

11:29.033 --> 11:30.600
You can't do that. Grow up!

11:30.667 --> 11:32.300
How am I supposed
to get a title tran...?

11:32.367 --> 11:34.433
How are you supposed
to drive without a license?

11:34.500 --> 11:38.333
I-I don't have to
drive the car to have...

11:38.400 --> 11:40.333
[Judy] You were driving the car.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.700
-I understand that.
-You were driving the car.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.667
But, therefore, like you asked me
if I got the title transferred.

11:44.734 --> 11:46.066
I couldn't get the title transferred.

11:46.133 --> 11:47.133
[Judy] Just a second.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.700
Why would you need to transfer a title

11:50.767 --> 11:52.934
when you can't drive it?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.333
I could have used it for other--

11:54.400 --> 11:57.300
other people could have used it.
They could have insured it.

11:57.367 --> 11:59.133
[laughs] You're an idiot.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.500
-[laughs]
-[Judy] You have five days...

12:00.567 --> 12:02.066
you have five days to get the car.

12:02.133 --> 12:04.100
Get a marshal and get the car.
We're done.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.600
-[Rebecca] Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

12:05.667 --> 12:06.867
[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.333
[dramatic music]

12:08.400 --> 12:10.800
I agree with her saying
that he's a moron. [laughs]

12:10.867 --> 12:12.200
I have no-no speech.

12:12.266 --> 12:13.900
Because he's controlling,
and he has nothing better

12:13.967 --> 12:15.667
with his life to do than control people.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.300
That I can proceed to have the car.

12:17.367 --> 12:18.900
-Kick him to the curb.
-No future.

12:18.967 --> 12:21.133
I'm ready to be done with it.
I want to go home. [chuckles]

12:21.200 --> 12:23.300
[Sarah] I think that case
perfectly demonstrated

12:23.367 --> 12:25.934
one of the first things
I learned in law school,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.133
which is the doctrine of clean hands.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.100
And you can't come to court
and expect the court

12:31.166 --> 12:33.934
to help you or rule in your favor

12:34.000 --> 12:35.567
when you're not doing the right thing.

12:35.633 --> 12:38.433
So, I think that just showed
that plaintiff,

12:38.500 --> 12:40.633
surprisingly enough,
that you can't come in

12:40.700 --> 12:43.333
and do the wrong thing,
and expect the court to help you.

12:43.400 --> 12:47.233
Yeah. I think, Sarah,
I love, that was also

12:47.300 --> 12:49.400
one of the first things
that I learned in law school,

12:49.467 --> 12:50.700
the doctrine of clean hands.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.367
And it was so blatant

12:53.433 --> 12:55.834
that so many of the litigants that I see

12:55.900 --> 12:58.400
don't think that driving
without a driver's license

12:58.467 --> 13:01.433
or without insurance
is serious business.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.100
And it is serious business.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.367
There's a lot at stake
when you drive without a license.

13:05.433 --> 13:07.300
-Yeah.
-Or a suspended license.

13:07.367 --> 13:09.734
And a lot at stake
if you drive without insurance.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.100
-We went to the same law school.
- [chuckles]

13:12.166 --> 13:13.500
-Good lesson of the day.
-Yeah.

13:13.567 --> 13:16.500
Case 10-42.
Edward versus Valdez.

13:16.567 --> 13:18.700
All parties, please step forward.

13:18.767 --> 13:21.600
[Narrator] <i>Denise Edwards</i>
<i>is suing her former friend,</i>

13:21.667 --> 13:26.467
<i>Veronica Valdez, for travel costs</i>
<i>from a trip to Las Vegas.</i>

13:26.533 --> 13:27.767
Oh, my goodness.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.900
Let's make this as quick
and painless as possible.

13:31.967 --> 13:36.000
You and Miss Valdez
met through someone

13:36.066 --> 13:39.400
who was living
in your sober living facility?

13:39.467 --> 13:42.033
Associated to the facility,
not living there.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.633
[Judy] And became friends.

13:43.700 --> 13:47.867
Decided to take a weekend
in Las Vegas.

13:47.934 --> 13:51.533
The idea was that each of you
was going to pay 400 dollars,

13:51.600 --> 13:54.900
which was the cost of hotel
and transportation.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.433
Part of your complaint
is that Miss Valdez

13:57.500 --> 14:01.600
only gave you 350 dollars
instead of the 400 dollars.

14:01.667 --> 14:04.066
She said she'd give you
the rest later, and she didn't.

14:04.133 --> 14:08.900
So this is a 50-dollar claim.

14:08.967 --> 14:14.200
Miss Valdez says that she bought
50 dollars' worth of drinks.

14:14.266 --> 14:16.266
-And food.
-[Judy] And food.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.200
Well, so I'm going to kick it
right over to you.

14:19.266 --> 14:22.633
Since we acknowledge
that it was 400 dollars,

14:22.700 --> 14:27.066
that you were 50 dollars shy,
and I want you to tell me

14:27.133 --> 14:30.700
when the conversation took place
when you were in Vegas

14:30.767 --> 14:35.633
that said, "I'm going to pay
for the food and the drinks

14:35.700 --> 14:38.900
instead of giving you
the 50 dollars that I owe you."

14:38.967 --> 14:43.533
It was done during like, I guess,
underneath the casino and...

14:43.600 --> 14:44.600
Tell me about the conversation,

14:44.667 --> 14:47.200
which, I'm going to tell you
right now, I'm skeptical about.

14:47.266 --> 14:51.000
So, I want you to tell me...
[scoffs] ...your version of it,

14:51.066 --> 14:52.166
and be fast because I went to...

14:52.233 --> 14:53.233
Okay, so I cashed after...

14:53.300 --> 14:55.967
[Judy] ...eight years of postgraduate
school to do this case.

14:56.033 --> 15:01.266
Sure. So, uh-- um,
I sent her Cash App 150.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.266
-[Judy] No, just a second.
-At the bottom of the...

15:02.333 --> 15:05.200
-[Judy] Just a second.
-...note.

15:05.266 --> 15:07.467
I said I owe her 50 dollars left.

15:07.533 --> 15:08.700
And I do have receipt of...

15:08.767 --> 15:12.033
All I want to know is
when the conversation,

15:12.100 --> 15:16.000
what you said to her
and what she said to you about

15:16.066 --> 15:19.934
making good on the 50 dollars
by buying drinks and food.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.033
-Sure.
-[Judy] I want you to tell me...

15:21.100 --> 15:22.333
...that I'm going to believe it.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.567
Okay, so it was taking place
in the casino,

15:25.633 --> 15:27.734
and we spoke over the drinks.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.100
-Spoke over drinks.
-[Veronica] Yes.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.667
You were sitting
and having drinks with her.

15:30.734 --> 15:32.300
-[Veronica] Right.
-And you said to her...?

15:32.367 --> 15:36.400
I'm gonna gra-- I'm going to
get you a few drinks, like two or four.

15:36.467 --> 15:38.233
No, like two, because
they're really expensive.

15:38.300 --> 15:41.266
-And then I bought lunch for everybody.
-And then?

15:41.333 --> 15:43.433
-I bought lunch for everyone.
-Who cares?

15:43.500 --> 15:46.166
[Veronica] Well, I mean,
that-that consolidates the 50.

15:46.233 --> 15:48.367
No, I want to know
when she consented to that

15:48.433 --> 15:50.133
-consolidating the 50?
-[Veronica] During that time.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.533
Well, what did she say to you?

15:51.600 --> 15:52.834
She said, "Sure."

15:52.900 --> 15:54.600
-Did that ever take place?
-No, ma'am.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.066
[Judy] No. Of course not.
You owe her 50 dollars.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.500
Now we're going to get
to the next part of your complaint.

15:57.567 --> 16:00.100
-[smiles] Oh, my God.
-[Judy] All right. It's ridiculous.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.400
The next part of your complaint
is that the defendant

16:02.467 --> 16:06.066
got so drunk at the airport,
going home, that she passed out

16:06.133 --> 16:09.500
and had to be taken out
by paramedics at the airport,

16:09.567 --> 16:11.200
causing you to miss your plane,

16:11.266 --> 16:13.900
causing you
to have to buy another ticket.

16:13.967 --> 16:15.567
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] That's right.

16:15.633 --> 16:18.300
How many people were with you,
coming home?

16:18.367 --> 16:19.700
Together was just the three of us.

16:19.767 --> 16:21.467
Well, the three of you. That's you.

16:22.467 --> 16:24.467
Did you stay on with her
at the hospital?

16:24.533 --> 16:25.867
No.

16:25.934 --> 16:27.433
Well, somebody stayed on
with her at the hospital.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.633
-No.
-They wouldn't allow me...

16:28.700 --> 16:29.900
-...to go to the hospital.
-Not you.

16:29.967 --> 16:31.200
Did somebody stay with you?

16:31.266 --> 16:33.333
Yes, a friend, a local friend.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.333
Well, if they wouldn't
allow you to go to the hospital,

16:35.400 --> 16:36.800
why did you miss your flight?

16:36.867 --> 16:39.600
They wouldn't allow me to leave her
until paramedics arrived.

16:39.667 --> 16:40.900
-That's a lie, Your Honor.
-[Judy] Oh, just a second.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.867
I don't know that.
What time was your flight in Vegas?

16:43.934 --> 16:45.867
Uh, we were leaving at six a.m.

16:45.934 --> 16:47.433
And what time did you get there?

16:47.500 --> 16:48.533
Approximately four a.m.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.567
And what time were you taken
to the hospital?

16:50.633 --> 16:52.033
Do you know?
Do you have the report?

16:52.100 --> 16:54.533
Um, no, I do not know
the approximate time.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.934
-Okay, say I do not know.
-[Veronica] I do not know.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.033
You do not know when
you were taken to the hospital

16:59.100 --> 17:03.166
for overuse of
prescription drugs and alcohol.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.400
-Correct.
-[Judy] Okay.

17:04.467 --> 17:07.500
What time
was an ambulance called?

17:07.567 --> 17:11.934
I believe it was approximately an hour
before we were boarding.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.533
Okay. And did you have
a non-refundable ticket?

17:14.600 --> 17:15.700
Yes, ma'am.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.533
How much was the ticket
that was non-refundable?

17:17.600 --> 17:19.000
Well, I had a voucher
that was applied to me

17:19.066 --> 17:20.400
for medical purposes after the fact,

17:20.467 --> 17:22.533
and it was 65 dollars,
68 dollars, excuse me.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.700
That was refund, well,
vouchered to me.

17:24.767 --> 17:29.000
Okay. So, you did present
evidence to someone

17:29.066 --> 17:32.133
that this was a medical emergency
and you had to remain.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.033
The airline was, uh, notified me

17:35.100 --> 17:37.500
that they had already documented
that it was medical,

17:37.567 --> 17:42.033
and that hopefully the airline
would assist me, and get back.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.166
And did they?

17:43.233 --> 17:44.266
-[Denise] Yes, ma'am.
-They did.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.900
So, how much money were you out?

17:46.967 --> 17:49.200
Um, the ticket
that I actually had to purchase

17:49.266 --> 17:51.600
because I had to be home the same day,

17:51.667 --> 17:55.033
the airline we were flying on
did not have a flight available

17:55.100 --> 17:56.433
for another three days.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.133
So, in order to get home
the same day,

17:58.200 --> 17:59.467
I actually had to purchase another ticket

17:59.533 --> 18:02.600
in the amount of 289 dollars.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.633
-You have a receipt for that?
-Yes, ma'am.

18:09.033 --> 18:10.533
Here it is.

18:15.900 --> 18:16.900
Thank you.

18:21.300 --> 18:24.533
Okay. Well, that's 339 dollars.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.166
Yes, ma'am.

18:26.233 --> 18:28.200
Miss Valdez, when you
passed out at the airport,

18:28.266 --> 18:32.033
the person who you said was
at the hospital was a local friend,

18:32.100 --> 18:34.033
that local friend was with you.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.367
-Is that right?
-Right.

18:35.433 --> 18:38.133
So, if they had caught their flight,

18:38.200 --> 18:39.300
you would have been left alone

18:39.367 --> 18:42.467
on the floor in the airport, alone.

18:42.533 --> 18:43.567
Do you understand?

18:44.567 --> 18:48.200
If one of my kids
passed out at an airport

18:48.266 --> 18:52.633
because they were drunk,
and I had to miss my flight,

18:52.700 --> 18:54.133
I would stay with them.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.200
But I would be furious.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.166
[dramatic music]

19:06.300 --> 19:09.300
[Narrator] <i>Denise Edwards</i>

19:19.066 --> 19:21.533
Okay, if they had caught their flight,

19:21.600 --> 19:23.934
you would have been
left alone on the floor

19:24.000 --> 19:25.667
in the airport, alone.

19:25.734 --> 19:26.934
Do you understand?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.467
-I do.
-[Judy] Do you? Okay.

19:28.533 --> 19:30.433
Um, may I also add something?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.533
-Yes.
-Okay.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.300
Your Honor, Dicky had called me.

19:35.367 --> 19:37.633
She was the first one prior to Denise,

19:37.700 --> 19:39.400
and she told me that her and Denise

19:39.467 --> 19:42.200
had an argument
about leaving me, um,

19:42.266 --> 19:45.200
because Denise was,
uh, hell-bent on leaving me

19:45.266 --> 19:47.533
because I'm a grown woman
and I shouldn't have...

19:47.600 --> 19:48.600
-[Veronica clears throat]
-I'm sure, I'm sure.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.734
-[Veronica] ...grieving my mom.
-I'm-- just a second.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.000
I'm sure that they were annoyed.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.600
-[Veronica] Right.
-I want to tell you something.

19:54.667 --> 19:58.767
If one of my kids
passed out at an airport

19:58.834 --> 20:03.867
because they were drunk,
and I had to miss my flight,

20:03.934 --> 20:07.233
I would stay with them.
But I would be furious.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.333
Sure. I was also...

20:08.400 --> 20:10.100
-[Judy] And if they...
-...grieving my mother, so, um...

20:10.166 --> 20:12.200
-Listen, listen.
-...I was going through a lot.

20:12.266 --> 20:16.600
I have to-- I have to tell you
something about grieving of which,

20:16.667 --> 20:19.333
I'm at an age where
I know a lot about grieving

20:19.400 --> 20:22.133
and young parents who go.

20:22.200 --> 20:25.767
There was a young man,
when I was in the family court,

20:25.834 --> 20:28.333
who was 14, 15 years old.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.266
And the excuse that he gave me
for selling cocaine,

20:32.333 --> 20:35.734
or maybe it was heroin--
his lawyer gave me--

20:35.800 --> 20:37.433
the kid had a long rap sheet,

20:37.500 --> 20:40.533
but I remember his lawyer
saying to me

20:40.600 --> 20:43.834
he sold the cocaine or heroin

20:43.900 --> 20:45.934
because his grandmother died.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
And I'm going to say to you
what I said to this lawyer,

20:50.066 --> 20:53.467
I said, you know,
I lost all of my grandparents,

20:53.533 --> 20:55.633
and I was very close to some of them.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.166
I also lost my mother at a young age.

20:58.233 --> 21:00.433
And I went through a grieving process.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.500
One of the things that I--
was farthest from my mind

21:03.567 --> 21:05.633
was selling cocaine or heroin.
[laughs]

21:05.700 --> 21:06.967
[laughter]

21:07.033 --> 21:11.333
That's not a reason to get blotto drunk

21:11.400 --> 21:15.300
so that paramedics
have to waste their time

21:15.367 --> 21:17.200
when they could be dealing
with somebody

21:17.266 --> 21:19.934
who was having a heart attack
or a stroke,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.033
or a gunshot wound,

21:22.100 --> 21:24.533
or something to come
and take you from the airport.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.000
That is not something I'm proud of.

21:26.066 --> 21:28.500
And, uh, kiddo,
and you're a grown woman.

21:28.567 --> 21:31.266
-Right.
-So, the right thing to do

21:31.333 --> 21:34.133
is because you caused her
to miss her flight

21:34.200 --> 21:37.100
for which even though
she may have been annoyed

21:37.166 --> 21:41.934
that you were kind of
overindulging on this vacation.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.600
By the way, you don't get credited
for your vacation that got spoilt.

21:45.667 --> 21:47.934
That was, next time don't invite her.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
But I think it is responsible of you

21:50.066 --> 21:51.600
to take care of her airline ticket.

21:51.667 --> 21:53.533
Judgment for the plaintiff
in the amount of

21:53.600 --> 21:55.400
339 dollars on the claim.

21:55.467 --> 21:57.633
Now, you have a counterclaim.

21:57.700 --> 22:01.433
Your counterclaim, Miss Valdez,
is that you believe

22:01.500 --> 22:04.900
that the plaintiff stole
your purse that had money in it.

22:04.967 --> 22:05.967
Right.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.200
Do you have any proof
she stole your purse?

22:08.266 --> 22:10.200
Actually, when Nikki first called me,

22:10.266 --> 22:13.100
um, her witness...

22:13.166 --> 22:14.967
-[Judy] Just a second.
-[Veronica] Sh-she told me that...

22:15.033 --> 22:17.100
No, when Nikki-- That's you?

22:17.166 --> 22:18.567
[Veronica] No, her witness.

22:18.633 --> 22:21.500
She's the only one
that called me when I was,

22:21.567 --> 22:25.300
um, when I came to,
and made sure I was okay,

22:25.367 --> 22:27.000
and everything like that.

22:27.066 --> 22:30.500
And she told me that right
before I boarded the plane,

22:30.567 --> 22:33.200
I had all my things with me
including my purse,

22:33.266 --> 22:34.667
which had my cash in it,

22:34.734 --> 22:37.100
and that Denise was
going through my things,

22:37.166 --> 22:41.266
looking at my medications,
looking at my-my-my money.

22:41.333 --> 22:44.500
And here's the picture
that Denise herself took of me.

22:44.567 --> 22:48.934
Um, as you can see,
my little satchel,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.934
or what you call--
can call is there with me.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.667
And this is right before
I got admitted to the ho--

22:57.734 --> 22:58.934
to the ambulance.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.367
And I also have a witness
on standby as phone.

23:02.433 --> 23:04.533
She couldn't attend due to COVID,

23:04.600 --> 23:08.033
but she also saw Denise
with my purse.

23:08.100 --> 23:11.367
And, uh, while she was picking up
the rest of my belongings

23:11.433 --> 23:14.533
as I was heading
into the ambulance, so...

23:14.600 --> 23:16.300
Did you take her purse?

23:16.367 --> 23:19.000
Uh, the purse was left behind with me
with all the rest of her belongings.

23:19.066 --> 23:21.166
I did have to open it
to give the ambulance

23:21.233 --> 23:23.834
the medication that she was taking
and her driver's license.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.100
No, Nikki wasn't there at that time.

23:25.166 --> 23:26.333
-I'm sorry about that.
-Just a second.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.834
Did you take her purse,
is my question.

23:29.900 --> 23:32.333
No, ma'am. It was left with her
luggage when I le-- handed it off.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.000
Fine. Did you see her take her purse?

23:35.066 --> 23:36.066
No.

23:36.133 --> 23:38.066
She went through it
and gave the paramedics something.

23:38.133 --> 23:41.166
So, Miss Valdez, you don't have
any proof that she took your purse.

23:41.233 --> 23:42.233
I have a witness.

23:42.300 --> 23:43.967
I'm ready to hear the witness.

23:44.033 --> 23:45.467
Via phone.

23:45.533 --> 23:48.033
I'm not ready to hear a witness via phone.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.467
[sighs] Well, she
couldn't make it due to COVID.

23:49.533 --> 23:51.100
-[Judy] Well, that's...
-May I add one thing?

23:51.166 --> 23:52.533
That is-that is not my problem.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.600
Uh, just on the-- on the trip
that we took originally,

23:55.667 --> 23:57.100
the only reason that I was
asking for the 400 dollars

23:57.166 --> 23:59.967
for my trip is because
I actually work with addicts,

24:00.100 --> 24:02.066
and to be put into
a situation with an addict

24:02.133 --> 24:04.066
when my purpose
was to get away from addicts,

24:04.133 --> 24:06.033
I kind of felt as though I...

24:06.100 --> 24:08.066
-[Judy] I don't care.
-...was cheated out of...

24:08.133 --> 24:11.066
Your feelings are
not quite relevant to me.

24:11.133 --> 24:13.500
You know, you can go see
Dr. Phil for feelings.

24:13.567 --> 24:16.934
Here, we deal with other things.
Three hundred and thirty-nine dollars.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.133
Judgment for the plaintiff.
We're finished. Thank you.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.300
[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

24:20.367 --> 24:22.033
[dramatic music]

24:22.100 --> 24:25.033
I guess it is what it is.
I'm just glad that this is over.

24:25.100 --> 24:28.033
I'm just glad that it's over.
I feel like justice was served.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.967
She's a bad spirit,
and she's just attention-seeking.

24:31.033 --> 24:32.633
Actually, on our second day there,

24:32.700 --> 24:36.166
we had an issue where we were
almost removed from the hotel.

24:36.233 --> 24:38.400
And so, there was
some evidence of that early on.

24:38.467 --> 24:40.467
I did overindulge.

24:40.533 --> 24:43.467
I did overindulge,
and I'm not making an excuse for it,

24:43.533 --> 24:45.433
but I was going through
a grieving process.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.367
And it was my first grieving thing ever.

24:48.433 --> 24:51.967
Because I've gotten used to it,
I have to separate myself from my feelings

24:52.033 --> 24:53.867
versus the necessity
for somebody to get help.

24:53.934 --> 24:56.367
Because she was the
last person to be seen with it.

24:56.433 --> 24:57.467
Not when it comes from an addict.

24:57.533 --> 25:00.300
She obviously didn't want to go to
regular court or anything

25:00.367 --> 25:02.734
because of whatever reason it is.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.233
For her to get the help that she needs.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.667
[Sarah] If that defendant had
a six a.m. flight from Vegas,

25:07.734 --> 25:11.166
it sounds like it was
one of those marathon nights

25:11.233 --> 25:13.233
where you go from drinking

25:13.300 --> 25:14.567
straight to the airport. [laughs]

25:14.633 --> 25:15.633
That's it.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.500
Which is not advisable for anyone,

25:17.567 --> 25:20.567
let alone someone
taking prescription medication.

25:20.633 --> 25:22.000
You're right. Unfortunate...

25:22.066 --> 25:25.367
and probably
very embarrassing for her.

25:25.433 --> 25:28.033
The whole thing just seems
so unseemly to me.

25:28.100 --> 25:30.467
I think she was entitled
to the airline ticket.

25:30.533 --> 25:33.000
She had a responsibility to stay.

25:33.066 --> 25:37.533
And she did, even though
she probably did it begrudgingly.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.700
Anyway, you're right, it was
probably a marathon evening.
