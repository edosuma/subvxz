01:28.338 --> 01:30.261
<i>Today really
marks the first stage</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:33.719
<i>of an unprecedented
technological advancement.</i>

01:34.636 --> 01:38.061
We have begun to identify
so-called Goldilocks planets.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.851
These are planets that share a
similar relationship with their sun

01:41.018 --> 01:42.144
<i>as we have with ours.</i>

01:42.227 --> 01:45.106
<i>If a planet's too far away
from its sun, it's too cold.</i>

01:45.188 --> 01:46.861
<i>If it's too close to
its sun, it's too hot.</i>

01:46.940 --> 01:50.114
<i>But for an Earth-like planet,
the distance is just right.</i>

01:50.193 --> 01:52.787
<i>Potentially perfect
for sustaining life.</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:56.958
We have finally managed
to identify one planet

01:57.117 --> 02:00.712
<i>that is the right distance
from its star to hold water</i>

02:00.787 --> 02:03.711
<i>and is the right mass
to sustain an atmosphere.</i>

02:05.167 --> 02:07.795
<i>Every 24 hours,
our station in Hawaii</i>

02:07.878 --> 02:12.600
<i>will transmit a signal to Landsat
7, our deep orbiting satellite,</i>

02:12.674 --> 02:16.895
which will amplify and relay the
signal to our targeted planet

02:17.054 --> 02:21.230
which is, rather grandly,
entitled Planet G.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.482
If there is intelligent life
out there, and they come here

02:24.561 --> 02:27.610
it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.532
Only, we're the Indians.

02:29.650 --> 02:35.248
Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare to
bear witness to the making of history.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.582
Start transmission.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.063
<i>It seems as though
NASA is setting up shop</i>

03:07.229 --> 03:08.947
<i>right here in our own backyard.</i>

03:09.106 --> 03:12.155
<i>Today, the Beacon International
Project was launched.</i>

03:12.234 --> 03:14.282
<i>Satellite dishes here on Oahu</i>

03:14.361 --> 03:17.490
<i>sending out very powerful
signals into deep space</i>

03:17.572 --> 03:19.870
<i>with an attempt to
communicate with anyone...</i>

03:20.200 --> 03:21.497
Another round, birthday boy.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.294
<i>...or anything that
might be out there listening.</i>

03:23.453 --> 03:24.705
A toast.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.131
Happy birthday, little brother.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.631
I'm wishing you success and
growth, and happiness.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.258
May this be
a great year for you.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.805
It's going to be a great year.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.929
I love you.
I love you, too.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.896
So, in the great
Hopper family tradition,

03:41.054 --> 03:44.228
this year I'm quoting
from Coach John Wooden.

03:44.599 --> 03:45.851
Johnny.

03:46.017 --> 03:49.237
"Adversity is
the state in which man""

03:49.312 --> 03:51.656
"most easily becomes
acquainted with himself"

03:52.357 --> 03:55.327
"being especially free
of admirers then."

03:55.402 --> 03:56.654
Cheers.

03:57.696 --> 03:58.822
I'm not cheers-ing that.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.077
It's a very good quote for you.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.785
"I may be free of admirers right
now but there is still time"?

04:02.868 --> 04:04.085
Will you shut up?

04:04.161 --> 04:05.458
Light your cupcake
and raise your glass.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.963
Did you get me that?

04:07.038 --> 04:08.460
Yes, I got you that.

04:08.623 --> 04:09.966
Thank you, that's very sweet.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.509
You're welcome.
You're very welcome.

04:14.004 --> 04:18.100
I got this guy, Tony. He said he
can get you a construction job.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.427
All you need to do is call him.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.187
Could I get a beer and a
chicken burrito, please?

04:22.345 --> 04:24.439
Sorry, kitchen's closed.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.728
You're not going
to call him, are you?

04:25.932 --> 04:28.526
Give Tony my best,
but I don't need you

04:28.602 --> 04:30.479
or Tony's help,
for that matter.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.194
You can call him or
join me in the Navy.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.693
No.
Great. All right.

04:35.859 --> 04:39.284
Happy birthday. Blow out
your candle and make a wish.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.125
Do not waste a wish on a girl.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.294
Wish for a job, an apartment.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.917
A new alternator belt, so I don't
have to drive you everywhere.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.374
A job, or...
You said "job" twice.

04:50.874 --> 04:54.048
It's my birthday and my wish.

04:54.878 --> 04:55.970
All right?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.969
Please don't waste it.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.265
You just wasted
that wish, didn't you?

05:02.344 --> 05:03.345
I'm going in.
You're not going in.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.771
How do I look?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.689
Wait, let me just fix that.

05:06.932 --> 05:07.933
Awesome!

05:08.016 --> 05:09.393
All right, princess,
go get 'em.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.653
Great start.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.657
Ugh.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.078
What seems to be the problem?

05:24.366 --> 05:26.243
I want a chicken burrito.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.454
Johnny, chicken burrito her.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.335
It ain't happening.
Chicken burrito her.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.758
Kitchen's closed, Hopper.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.089
What's your name?

05:35.252 --> 05:36.674
I'm hungry.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.055
That's not your name.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.852
If you give me five minutes

05:44.010 --> 05:46.104
I will get you
your chicken burrito.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.229
Five minutes, starting now.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.693
Chicken burrito time, I'm out.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.441
Chicken burrito, roger that.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.952
Wait! Hi!

06:04.489 --> 06:05.911
No! Let's just...

06:05.991 --> 06:08.039
Just one twist of the key
and we will be good.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.415
How are you, ma'am?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.713
How you doing?
Burritos, right there.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.836
It's closed.
Too late, pal.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.216
Okay.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.589
It's right there. Please?

06:16.668 --> 06:19.547
It's too late to eat a burrito.
Too many complex carbs.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.972
$3.99...

06:31.141 --> 06:32.984
Chicken burrito.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.655
I got it!

07:22.734 --> 07:24.407
Hey! Freeze!

07:32.494 --> 07:34.292
I got a burrito!
I got it!

07:34.371 --> 07:35.372
Freeze!

07:38.333 --> 07:39.676
Stay down!

07:40.919 --> 07:42.216
He's getting back up!

08:03.066 --> 08:05.569
I've had it!
Look at yourself!

08:05.902 --> 08:08.655
How is it that you
screw everything up?

08:10.740 --> 08:13.289
By the way, that girl you were
trying to impress last night,

08:13.952 --> 08:15.670
do you know who her father is?

08:15.745 --> 08:16.871
Admiral Shane!

08:17.288 --> 08:19.211
He runs the whole damn fleet!

08:19.290 --> 08:22.840
So, now you're messing
with my job. My life!

08:23.086 --> 08:24.759
You know that girl?

08:26.423 --> 08:27.424
The burrito girl?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.601
I've always stayed out of
your business, haven't I?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.928
Because I was hoping
that maybe one day

08:32.011 --> 08:33.355
you would learn
from your mistakes.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.182
You would grow up,
you would mature a bit!

08:35.265 --> 08:36.938
Is my back all right?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.441
Oh, my God! My back!

08:40.520 --> 08:43.023
You're 26, and what have you got?
You got, what?

08:43.106 --> 08:44.779
Sixty-five dollars
to your name?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.030
I got tazed.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.453
A car that doesn't start.
You're living on my couch!

08:49.446 --> 08:51.289
Those things work!

08:51.364 --> 08:53.116
Man, look at yourself.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.706
Oh, my God.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.458
As from now,

08:57.620 --> 09:00.464
as from right this second, there
is a new dynamic at play.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.216
And this dynamic
is the following.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.545
From here on, until I state otherwise,
there will be no more debate,

09:04.878 --> 09:07.131
no more discussion,
no more compromise!

09:07.213 --> 09:10.888
It's me speaking, you listening.
Me saying, you doing.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.894
Do you understand that?

09:13.636 --> 09:16.105
It's time for
a new course of action.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.478
A new direction.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.026
A game change.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.529
You are joining me in the Navy.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.922
<i>Live, local,
this is Hawaii News Now.</i>

09:49.089 --> 09:50.887
<i>Thousands of sailors
on dozens of ships</i>

09:50.965 --> 09:52.592
<i>are coming to Hawaii for RIMPAC</i>

09:52.759 --> 09:54.011
<i>RIMPAC is the world's largest</i>

09:54.094 --> 09:55.846
<i>multinational
maritime exercise.</i>

09:56.012 --> 09:59.016
<i>RIMPAC is a
military ballet of 14 navies...</i>

09:59.182 --> 10:00.604
<i>20, 000 Navy personnel.</i>

10:00.683 --> 10:03.232
<i>Cooperation and collaboration
amongst the countries is the goal.</i>

10:03.394 --> 10:04.691
<i>Relationship-building is the key.</i>

10:04.771 --> 10:06.944
<i>Not all the action
is taking place out on the water.</i>

10:07.023 --> 10:09.947
<i>There will also be sporting
events here on land.</i>

10:10.026 --> 10:13.280
<i>Forget World Cup,
this is the RIMPAC Cup final.</i>

10:14.030 --> 10:17.375
<i>It's another beautiful
day here in Hawaii, as usual.</i>

10:17.450 --> 10:20.044
<i>Indeed it is, but a
storm is brewing on the field</i>

10:20.120 --> 10:23.920
<i>as the scrappy U.S.A. team
is butting heads with Japan.</i>

10:24.082 --> 10:25.880
<i>The score is 2-nil, Japan.</i>

10:26.042 --> 10:27.965
<i>The U.S. has been
trailing all day.</i>

10:28.044 --> 10:31.139
<i>Team leader Alex Hopper has got to do
something to rally the troops here.</i>

10:31.297 --> 10:32.344
Turn it up!

10:32.423 --> 10:33.549
<i>Big save! Great save!</i>

10:33.633 --> 10:37.934
<i>Big save! Stone Hopper,
he's answered every test today.</i>

10:38.721 --> 10:40.769
What's wrong with you,
drama queen?

10:40.932 --> 10:42.229
Get up, princess, come on!

10:45.228 --> 10:48.072
<i>U.S.A.'s Ordy squares
the ball over to number 6, Alan.</i>

10:48.148 --> 10:49.650
<i>Clever backheel into space...</i>

10:49.732 --> 10:53.578
<i>Hopper... Goal!</i>

10:55.572 --> 10:57.495
<i>A missile, past Iwashiro.</i>

10:57.824 --> 11:01.169
<i>The U.S. is finally on the
board, showing some signs of life</i>

11:01.327 --> 11:03.295
<i>with the score, 2-1, Japan.</i>

11:03.454 --> 11:06.628
<i>We are now into stoppage time.
Can the U.S. tie it up?</i>

11:06.916 --> 11:08.213
Time! Time! Time!

11:08.293 --> 11:09.419
One minute left.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.596
Alex, it's coming your way!

11:15.341 --> 11:17.184
<i>Stone Hopper
has placed it perfectly.</i>

11:17.260 --> 11:18.933
<i>It takes a fortuitous bounce.</i>

11:19.012 --> 11:21.561
<i>Hopper is underneath it
and on-side.</i>

11:22.807 --> 11:24.059
Hey, ref!

11:24.142 --> 11:27.487
<i>A penalty kick has
been awarded to the United States.</i>

11:27.562 --> 11:30.611
<i>Nagata made contact with
Hopper inside the box.</i>

11:30.690 --> 11:33.409
<i>And by "contact," you
mean Nagata kicked him in the face.</i>

11:33.484 --> 11:34.656
You all right?

11:34.736 --> 11:35.828
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.538
<i>Stone Hopper
has come up the field.</i>

11:37.614 --> 11:39.161
I'm fine.
I don't need your help.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.542
Bronson is going to take it.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.961
Bronson!

11:43.119 --> 11:45.121
What do you mean, "Bronson"?
No, negative.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.540
I'm fine. Bronson,
you're gonna take this.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.546
Bronson, don't move.
Bronson, come here.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.344
Bronson, you move one
more step, you're dead!

11:51.502 --> 11:54.130
Do you want to die today?
Do you want to die?

11:54.297 --> 11:55.719
Good choice.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.391
He is definitely concussed.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.053
You just threatened
one of my sailors.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.559
<i>Looks like it's going to
be his little brother, Alex Hopper.</i>

12:02.639 --> 12:04.733
<i>If I was Stone, I
would have picked another shooter.</i>

12:04.807 --> 12:06.309
<i>I'm skeptical that
Hopper is 100 percent.</i>

12:06.392 --> 12:09.612
Engage, engage.
Impose will, impose will.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.315
There are two kinds
of idiots, Hopper.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.359
One looks where he kicks,

12:14.525 --> 12:17.074
the other looks
where he doesn't kick.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.868
Which idiot are you?

12:20.198 --> 12:23.828
I'm the idiot that's going to kick
it through your keeper's face.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.336
Get ready for overtime.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.586
<i>All eyes on Hopper.</i>

12:29.666 --> 12:31.668
<i>He could send this
into overtime.</i>

12:35.255 --> 12:36.848
ANNOUNCER <i>And</i> here we go.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.517
<i>If Hopper scores, the U.S.
will go into overtime.</i>

12:47.684 --> 12:49.402
Oh!

12:50.853 --> 12:55.529
<i>Hopper sails one miles over
the crossbar, nowhere near the goal...</i>

12:55.692 --> 12:56.864
<i>typical.</i>

12:56.943 --> 12:59.196
<i>What a
heartbreak for the U.S.</i>

13:07.120 --> 13:11.466
<i>It was a very poor attempt
by the obviously injured Alex Hopper.</i>

13:11.541 --> 13:13.384
<i>He refused to
come out of the game</i>

13:13.459 --> 13:16.178
<i>and his stubbornness
cost the United States.</i>

13:17.630 --> 13:22.477
<i>Congratulations to Japan,
our 2012 RIMPAC Cup winners.</i>

13:22.552 --> 13:24.054
<i>The final, as we sign off,</i>

13:24.137 --> 13:27.357
<i>Japan, 2.
The United States, 1.</i>

13:41.738 --> 13:43.331
Are you ready for this?
Born.

13:43.406 --> 13:44.498
Are you sure?

13:44.574 --> 13:46.497
Never been more sure
of anything in my life.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.244
What are you going to say?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.080
I'm going to walk up
to him, man to man,

13:50.163 --> 13:51.915
and look him
straight in the eyes.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.090
With what words?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.668
My words.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.097
Okay.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.090
"Sir..."

14:05.261 --> 14:08.014
"Your daughter is the best thing
that has ever happened to me."

14:09.432 --> 14:12.686
"She's smart, kind,
beautiful, funny,"

14:12.852 --> 14:14.775
"and I'm madly
in love with her."

14:15.563 --> 14:19.409
"It would be an honor to have
your permission to marry her."

14:23.905 --> 14:25.157
I love you.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.912
I love you, too.

15:06.489 --> 15:10.494
<i>First off, I'd like to welcome you all to
the RIMPAC International Na val War Games.</i>

15:10.618 --> 15:12.461
<i>And I'd like to
welcome you on board</i>

15:12.537 --> 15:15.040
<i>the greatest fighting ship
in American naval history.</i>

15:15.665 --> 15:18.464
<i>The “Mighty Mo,"
the</i> U.S.S. Missouri.

15:26.676 --> 15:27.802
<i>And fought in World War II...</i>

15:27.885 --> 15:28.886
Shit!

15:28.970 --> 15:30.438
Hopper, your cover.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.560
I'm keeping you on your toes.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.569
Hopper, let's go, come on.
Hopper!

15:39.021 --> 15:40.022
This way.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.779
No, no, no.

15:41.858 --> 15:42.905
That way, sir.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.156
Yes, yes, I knew that.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.532
We knew that.
You look good.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.823
The <i>U.S.S. Missouri</i>
was the final battleship

15:47.905 --> 15:49.657
to be completed by
the United States

15:49.824 --> 15:51.542
before being de-commissioned
and replaced

15:51.617 --> 15:53.335
with a more modern
fleet of vessels,

15:53.411 --> 15:55.004
like destroyers.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.591
What's the difference between
a battleship and a destroyer?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.169
Battleships are great ships.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.966
But they are kind
of like dinosaurs.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.140
They're designed to take hits,
like a floating punching bag.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.809
But then there's destroyers,
which are just awesome.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.892
They're designed to dish it
out like the Terminator.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.764
Are you a Captain?

16:13.848 --> 16:16.943
No, he's not a Captain because
he's always late. Come on.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.728
I fight the ship.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.026
Which is even better.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.162
Listen, get it done.
Get it done.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.830
Babe, it's a formality.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.499
Okay, go.
I'm all over it.

16:31.574 --> 16:34.418
<i>We have with us today,
veterans from the Missouri</i>

16:34.494 --> 16:37.714
<i>who have served on her, some
going back to World War II.</i>

16:38.039 --> 16:41.839
<i>Examples of the finest men to
have ever served in any navy.</i>

16:59.268 --> 17:02.363
Lieutenant Hopper, what an honor.
Thank you for joining us.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.107
Good to be here.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.318
<i>And now,
as we prepare to embark</i>

17:06.400 --> 17:08.117
<i>on this outstanding exercise...</i>

17:08.194 --> 17:09.867
I'm nervous.
Shades off.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.915
<i>I would like the Commanding
Officers to come to the stage.</i>

17:12.990 --> 17:14.992
<i>Captain Nagata, Japan.</i>

17:17.828 --> 17:19.079
<i>Captain Lou, Malaysia.</i>

17:20.705 --> 17:22.959
It's so close to
the way we say it.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.464
He hates me.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.467
He doesn't hate you.
Shut up. Shut up.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.888
<i>Captain Jacks, Australia.</i>

17:27.964 --> 17:29.887
G'day.
Shut up.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.051
G'day!

17:32.134 --> 17:33.977
Shut up.
G'day.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.227
<i>A special acknowledgment to Commander
Stone Hopper, United States Navy.</i>

17:37.306 --> 17:40.105
Go, that's your call.
Knock 'em out.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.691
<i>Who, along with his
outstanding crew and ship,</i>

17:43.229 --> 17:45.072
<i>had the highest
overall rating last year.</i>

17:45.982 --> 17:47.825
Shades off, Hopper.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.402
<i>Commander.</i>

17:49.485 --> 17:50.657
<i>Thank you, Admiral.</i>

17:50.736 --> 17:54.036
<i>Welcome, everybody. It's really
great to see you all here today.</i>

17:54.407 --> 17:57.911
<i>Especially you, gentlemen.
It's a true honor.</i>

17:58.578 --> 18:01.206
<i>Me and my crew, we're going to
have to be on our toes this year</i>

18:01.372 --> 18:05.502
<i>because your ships look outstanding
and your men look ready.</i>

18:06.210 --> 18:07.678
<i>So, good luck out there.</i>

18:07.878 --> 18:10.631
<i>Be safe and keep charging.</i>

18:19.765 --> 18:22.860
He loves his daughter, she loves you.
He's going to respect that.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.104
Hey, Mike.
Admiral.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.272
You remember Sam?

18:26.355 --> 18:29.108
It's an obsolete tradition,
this asking for permission.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.784
Tell me where this came from.
Stop.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.362
Sam's a physical therapist now.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.372
Stop worrying about this and walk
up and do what you got to do.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.783
Hello, Hopper.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.459
Why are you here?

18:40.578 --> 18:42.580
This is going to be sweet.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.506
I was within the rules.
Really?

18:44.582 --> 18:46.004
Were you in the rules when
you kicked me in the face?

18:46.083 --> 18:48.256
Isn't there something more important
you should be doing right now?

18:48.336 --> 18:49.588
He hates the man.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.718
That seems a bit juvenile,
wouldn't you say?

18:51.881 --> 18:53.554
Go mess with him
and see what happens.

18:53.758 --> 18:54.975
- Why?
- Do it.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.644
Would it be funny if I
punched you in the face?

18:56.719 --> 18:57.936
Would that be funny?
Stop it.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.769
Chicken.
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.774
Yeah, I love it.
A two-piece meal.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.602
You look like Colonel
Sanders, actually.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.811
He was a handsome man.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.109
Good job out there, Dad.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.611
What do you want?

19:09.690 --> 19:11.567
Hopper needs five
minutes of your time.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.661
That's enough.
What do you mean?

19:14.737 --> 19:17.035
Don't you have something more important
you should be doing right now?

19:17.114 --> 19:18.411
Three minutes, tops.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.043
Thank you. I love you.
Thank you, Daddy.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.666
Love you, too.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.122
He's going to smash my face in.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.548
He's not going to
smash your face in.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.587
Oh, my God.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.724
Sir, it would be an honor.

19:40.638 --> 19:43.357
Sir. Sir. Sir.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.027
Give me your permission.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.946
It would be an honor
to have your permission.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.819
Sir, give me your permission.
What's your deal?

19:50.940 --> 19:52.362
It would be a thankful honor

19:52.441 --> 19:56.412
to have your permission
to honor your hand.

19:56.779 --> 19:57.826
What?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.699
Oh, my God.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.165
Sir.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.418
May I please
marry your daughter?

20:08.624 --> 20:10.547
She's everything I have,

20:10.710 --> 20:12.428
and I love her.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.133
Talking to yourself,
Mr. Hopper?

20:19.927 --> 20:21.975
Yeah, I was.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.773
I was actually talking
about you, Nagata.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.144
Mmm-hmm.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.324
That's for
kicking me in the face.

20:38.487 --> 20:42.242
Eat it! Take it!
Let go! Let go.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.585
What the...

20:50.458 --> 20:55.089
Sir, it was a fluke accident.
The bathroom floor was wet.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.756
I began to fall.

20:56.839 --> 21:00.309
Captain Nagata kindly
reached out to help.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.890
Our heads go bang.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.347
We fall back.
Bang, again.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.149
Just like the great
Jerry Lewis.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.271
Jerry Lewis?

21:08.392 --> 21:09.939
Did he just say "Jerry Lewis"?

21:10.019 --> 21:11.020
Yes, sir.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.446
Are you kidding me?

21:12.855 --> 21:16.905
<i>The Bellboy and original
The Nutty Professor.</i>

21:17.443 --> 21:18.615
Very good movies.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.321
He is a great
humanitarian, sir.

21:21.363 --> 21:25.209
You both think this is a joke
and you are very much mistaken.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.124
This will not happen again.
Do I make myself clear?

21:28.204 --> 21:29.547
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

21:29.705 --> 21:33.801
Gentlemen, give me a minute
with Mr. Hopper, here.

21:43.177 --> 21:46.021
What is wrong with you?

21:48.682 --> 21:53.688
You've got skills, but I have never
ever seen a man waste them like you.

21:56.524 --> 21:59.994
"Keep the ship out of
the surf and spray..."

22:00.069 --> 22:02.743
"...or you will
plunge to destruction."

22:03.572 --> 22:04.698
Homer, sir.

22:08.077 --> 22:12.958
The fact that you know that
infuriates me beyond words.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.759
What my daughter sees in you
is a great mystery to me.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.512
You are a very smart individual

22:22.591 --> 22:27.097
with very weak character, leadership
and decision-making skills.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.938
Do you have anything
to say to me? Anything?

22:39.608 --> 22:41.451
Negative, sir.

22:45.322 --> 22:48.417
Enjoy these naval
exercises, Hopper.

22:48.576 --> 22:51.170
They are likely
to be your last.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.750
Dismissed.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.718
<i>Is there anything
I can do to help?</i>

22:59.003 --> 23:00.050
Negative.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.221
If you want to
talk about anything...

23:01.297 --> 23:02.298
I don't.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.759
If you change your mind...
I won't.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.469
Roger that.

23:34.330 --> 23:38.756
Contact DESRON ONE. Commence
anti-submarine warfare exercises.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.340
Commence air operations.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.525
Good afternoon, Sampson.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.570
<i>Welcome to Day One of
the RIMPAC naval war games.</i>

24:05.861 --> 24:07.738
<i>We are here to sharpen
our skills as a team.</i>

24:09.740 --> 24:11.492
As your weapons officer,

24:11.575 --> 24:15.421
let me remind you
that this is a combat vessel

24:15.496 --> 24:19.922
and we will excel
in our command and control.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.837
<i>I want everyone to stay frosty.</i>

24:23.003 --> 24:25.506
We're going to be close-maneuvering
with 13 nations out here.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.809
We are here to
crush every other ship.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.390
I'm excited to
see what we learn.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.647
We are not here in this
weapons room to learn.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.776
Be safe out there, look out for
each other and keep charging.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.187
If we return to Pearl

24:39.269 --> 24:43.445
without having outperformed
every other ship on that ocean,

24:43.524 --> 24:44.776
I will personally...

24:44.858 --> 24:47.327
Yo, Saunders, we've ended
up in a department

24:47.403 --> 24:51.078
run by some kind of Donald
Trump/Mike Tyson mutant combo.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.283
What was that,
Petty Officer Raikes?

24:53.367 --> 24:54.368
Nothing, sir.

24:54.451 --> 24:58.126
I swear you said, "Donald
Trump." Want to clarify?

24:59.415 --> 25:01.588
I think I heard a "Mike
Tyson," <i>as</i> well.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.128
If you did, it was only
in reference to the fact

25:04.211 --> 25:07.511
that you both project
great physical intensity, sir.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.133
That's flattering.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.102
Hopper! There's a helo
headed for the Sampson.

25:12.261 --> 25:13.558
Make sure your ass is on it.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.184
Why?
I don't know why!

25:15.264 --> 25:16.561
Just make sure you're on it!

25:16.724 --> 25:18.146
Copy, sir.

25:19.393 --> 25:20.440
Damn.

25:20.602 --> 25:24.197
<i>Scorpion one four, clear our deck.
En route with parts and techs.</i>

25:24.273 --> 25:26.742
<i>Confirm
Lieutenant Hopper en route.</i>

25:43.751 --> 25:45.173
I just got off
the phone with the JAG.

25:45.627 --> 25:46.753
And?

25:49.715 --> 25:52.514
They are probably going to
kick you out of the Navy.

25:54.845 --> 25:55.937
When?

25:56.013 --> 25:57.435
The day we get back.

25:57.598 --> 25:58.599
From RIMPAC?

25:58.682 --> 25:59.854
Yeah.

26:02.519 --> 26:05.068
You have got to make some calls.
There has got to be...

26:05.147 --> 26:07.195
Who do I call to
teach you humility?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.995
I am sorry,
I don't have that number.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.076
I just don't get it, man.

26:17.785 --> 26:20.038
You have got so much potential.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.632
I'm sorry you have
to deal with this.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.344
And I am sorry I let you down.

27:21.557 --> 27:22.604
Stand up nice and tall.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.151
I want you to focus
on that green marker,

27:24.226 --> 27:25.318
right in the middle
of your back.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.896
What do you think
I'm paying attention to?

27:27.688 --> 27:28.814
Keep your feet together.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.565
My feet can't get any closer.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.568
Stand up tall. All right.
I had enough of this.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.320
Keep going.
Just a little bit more.

27:34.403 --> 27:35.746
Turn the damned thing off!

27:35.821 --> 27:36.947
Come on.
We're just about there.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.407
Turn it off now!

27:39.408 --> 27:41.536
I'm your new
physical therapist.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.499
I am sensing a lot of anger.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.543
Very perceptive of you.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.927
Is there anything besides
anger in there, Mick?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.013
Not much.

27:59.678 --> 28:03.774
Your last therapist says that
you lost the will to fight.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.231
Is that accurate?

28:06.310 --> 28:09.780
I lost my fight
when I lost my legs.

28:15.360 --> 28:20.082
Do you realize you're still the same
man that won the Golden Gloves at 22?

28:20.240 --> 28:23.790
A Bronze Star in Afghanistan?
The same man.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.001
I am half a man.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.259
And half a man ain't
enough to be a soldier.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.846
That's all I have ever known.

28:37.674 --> 28:40.097
All right. Let's go.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.311
We are going to take a walk.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.434
No, we are not.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.981
Legs on.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.775
You're doing pretty good for a
guy who doesn't want to be hiking.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.948
My dog, Mustard,
could climb this mountain.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.155
Great, you and Mustard can go and
make some memories on Mauna Kea.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.703
Sounds like fun.

28:57.778 --> 29:01.282
Mustard's dead. Mustard
got hit by a dump truck.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.241
I'm sorry.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.500
I'm over it.

29:10.374 --> 29:12.672
Hey. I thought you would
be out of range by now.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.214
I have around
five minutes of left time.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.714
<i>How is it?</i>

29:17.798 --> 29:18.890
It's fine.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.517
I'm sorry. I messed up.

29:29.017 --> 29:32.738
<i>And I'm going to talk to your
father as soon as I get back.</i>

29:33.397 --> 29:35.866
Stop messing things up, okay?

29:36.149 --> 29:38.322
Copy that. I love you.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.449
I love you.

30:09.224 --> 30:11.318
What is it, Parker?
Take a look at this.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.275
Nice one.
It's a joke, right?

30:20.944 --> 30:22.412
I don't think so.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.838
My God.

30:43.592 --> 30:44.684
Cal.

30:47.804 --> 30:48.976
Cal.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.063
Huh? Cal!

30:52.476 --> 30:54.820
Got some weird activity
on all the radar screens.

30:54.895 --> 30:55.987
Weird?

30:56.063 --> 30:57.610
Yeah, man. Really weird.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.358
Mmm-hmm.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.366
Oh, uh, Dr. Nogrady is
on the phone for you, too.

31:04.029 --> 31:07.078
That is weird.
Seriously, Dr. Nogrady?

31:07.240 --> 31:09.459
Lead with that next time.
Okay, Danny?

31:09.618 --> 31:11.586
You got to start
prioritizing your information.

31:11.745 --> 31:14.248
If you have to tell me "1,
2, 3," you don't start with

31:14.331 --> 31:15.548
You know what I mean?

31:15.624 --> 31:18.503
I mean, I'm not saying
that you are a boob,

31:18.585 --> 31:21.179
but this is
boob-ish behavior.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.216
Hi, Dr. Nogrady.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.676
<i>Are you seeing
what I am seeing?</i>

31:25.842 --> 31:27.219
The incoming tracks.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.303
<i>Correct.</i>

31:29.638 --> 31:32.187
I've got five
distinct objects...

31:32.349 --> 31:36.695
<i>Five distinct objects
that are moving in formation.</i>

31:36.853 --> 31:40.198
They are locked
in on my signal.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.071
They are headed
straight for me.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.326
<i>Correct.</i>

31:43.485 --> 31:45.829
Maybe we should call NASA.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.991
<i>NASA have called us. They're
on the phone right now.</i>

31:50.283 --> 31:52.001
<i>Good morning,
Mr. Zapata.</i>

31:52.828 --> 31:53.920
<i>NASA?</i>

32:06.341 --> 32:08.969
We are tracking something
splintering off of the main group.

32:09.136 --> 32:12.857
That's not splitting off.
That thing is breaking apart.

32:19.855 --> 32:22.950
Has anyone called the Chinese?
Because this is no meteor.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.952
Yes, we have checked. It's not the
Russians, it's not the Chinese.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.328
Maybe we should
call the Air Force,

32:27.404 --> 32:29.122
because they might want
to fuel up their jets.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.874
<i>The Air Force is online.</i>

32:32.284 --> 32:34.878
It appears the event
is headed your way.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.379
Prepare yourself.

32:36.538 --> 32:40.634
<i>Roger that. How would you suggest
that I prepare myself, sir?</i>

32:41.501 --> 32:42.798
Brace.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.659
<i>Let's all be seated.</i>

33:49.819 --> 33:52.117
I am hoping somebody here
can explain this to me.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.625
Mr. Secretary, four of the five
objects landed in the Pacific Ocean.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.786
The fifth one appeared
to have broken apart

33:57.869 --> 33:59.746
making significant
contact with Hong Kong,

33:59.913 --> 34:01.506
but other places
were also affected.

34:01.665 --> 34:04.088
Scotland, Germany,
France, even Iowa.

34:04.251 --> 34:05.377
So, what is it?

34:05.544 --> 34:08.092
Sir, at this point we are working
on a couple of theories.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.217
And you are who, sir?

34:09.755 --> 34:11.099
I am with NASA.

34:11.341 --> 34:14.014
What is NASA present
in this room for?

34:18.639 --> 34:21.563
<i>We are looking
at the very real possibility</i>

34:21.643 --> 34:25.318
<i>that this is legitimate
extraterrestrial contact.</i>

34:26.481 --> 34:30.577
<i>It appears that it originated
from the Gliese solar system.</i>

34:30.819 --> 34:32.446
<i>Home of Planet G.</i>

34:32.612 --> 34:36.367
You are saying that
we sent out a signal

34:36.533 --> 34:39.706
and we got back
an alien response?

34:53.382 --> 34:55.511
<i>Sir, we just
got word from Pearl.</i>

34:55.594 --> 34:57.062
<i>They believe whatever made
impact with Hong Kong,</i>

34:57.220 --> 34:58.893
has also made impact
with the Pacific Ocean.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.564
Where in the Pacific?

35:00.724 --> 35:04.570
Approximately 150 miles south
of where we are right now, sir.

35:04.728 --> 35:08.403
It should be right there, but
we are not seeing anything.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.363
Get me the Sampson.
Yes, sir.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.869
Base course, 2-2-0. Speed, 25.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.378
Captain on the bridge!

35:38.303 --> 35:39.646
<i>As casualty reports come in,</i>

35:39.721 --> 35:42.520
<i>it's still unclear exactly what
it was that hit Hong Kong.</i>

35:49.022 --> 35:51.445
<i>It isn't anything
from this planet.</i>

35:52.317 --> 35:53.614
<i>How do we know that?</i>

35:53.693 --> 35:55.320
Because the Chinese
have sampled it.

35:56.071 --> 35:59.826
<i>It's made of a material that does
not exist in the periodic table.</i>

36:00.241 --> 36:02.243
It's literally
not of this Earth.

36:02.410 --> 36:05.004
The only element they've been
able to identify is lawrencium.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.915
<i>Lawrencium?</i>

36:09.376 --> 36:10.343
You got to stop tapping.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.920
You're tapping.
You're the loud one.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.134
<i>Looking at the grid patterns,</i>

36:13.213 --> 36:14.556
<i>it's something in
the neighborhood</i>

36:14.714 --> 36:17.433
<i>of solar paneling
or communications paneling.</i>

36:17.592 --> 36:19.936
It may be some kind of
a communication unit.

36:21.304 --> 36:23.181
<i>Communications?</i>

36:23.765 --> 36:26.484
<i>Who is communicating what?
To who?</i>

36:34.442 --> 36:36.945
What the heck is that?

36:37.445 --> 36:39.948
Bridge, starboard lookout. I've
got an unknown surface contact.

36:40.115 --> 36:43.961
Bearing is 2-3-2 true,
approximately 8,000 yards.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.299
Sir?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.376
Yeah.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.711
You may want to come
take a look at this.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.720
I am looking at it,
Mr. Strodell.

36:55.463 --> 36:56.840
On the radar, sir.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.800
Something very peculiar.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.268
That's the
<i>John Paul Jones</i>, right?

37:01.344 --> 37:02.345
Yes, sir.

37:02.429 --> 37:04.807
The <i>Myoko</i> ?
Yes, sir, it is.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.816
So, why don't I see...

37:07.142 --> 37:08.610
See that?

37:12.147 --> 37:16.527
Combat, Captain. I have a visual on the
track bearing 2-3-7 on the horizon.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.112
<i>What do you hold
in that bearing?</i>

37:18.194 --> 37:20.196
Bridge, TAO.
I've got nothing at 2-3-7.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.574
I'm looking right at it, Mr. Hopper.
Find me something.

37:22.699 --> 37:26.044
Scope, 2-3-7, what do you got?
Stand by.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.005
That's negative, sir.
Scope's clear, I got nothing.

37:29.164 --> 37:30.416
Taylor, did you break
this son-of-a-bitch?

37:30.582 --> 37:32.926
No, I didn't do
anything to it, sir.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.799
You know I will throw
your ass off this ship.

37:34.878 --> 37:35.879
I know you will, sir.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.013
Got it, sir.
On my camera.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.550
What is it?

37:39.716 --> 37:41.184
I don't know.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.939
Is this some kind of exercise?

37:47.140 --> 37:48.357
Probably.

37:48.516 --> 37:52.237
Unknown vessel in the vicinity of
1-5 degrees, 3-7 minutes north,

37:52.395 --> 37:54.864
<i>and 1-5-9 degrees,
3-3 minutes west.</i>

37:55.023 --> 37:56.445
<i>Request you
establish communications</i>

37:56.524 --> 37:58.777
<i>with my vessel
on VHF channel 16,</i>

37:58.943 --> 38:00.445
and identify yourself, over.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.077
<i>John Paul Jones, this is
Sampson, Charlie</i> Oscar.

38:03.156 --> 38:04.533
<i>John Paul Jones, Charlie</i> Oscar.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.327
I would like you to send a team
over and take a closer look.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.588
No problem. We will get a
team in the water right away.

38:09.662 --> 38:10.788
Roger.

38:10.872 --> 38:14.046
I'll tell you what, boys,
this is a head-stumper.

38:40.568 --> 38:44.539
What is it?
Lost cargo? Chinese?

38:45.657 --> 38:46.749
I don't know.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.920
Yacht? Satellite?

38:50.703 --> 38:55.254
Beast, I didn't know five seconds
ago, and I don't know now.

38:56.918 --> 38:59.717
<i>This is the U.S. Navy warship</i>
John Paul Jones.

38:59.879 --> 39:02.803
<i>I'm attempting to
communicate with you.</i>

39:06.761 --> 39:08.434
<i>Prepare to be boarded.</i>

39:33.454 --> 39:34.626
You ever seen
anything like this?

39:35.498 --> 39:36.545
No.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.385
It's weird, man.

40:11.951 --> 40:15.125
LT! I don't think
that's a good idea.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.167
Got it, chief.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.524
Real bad idea, Lieutenant.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.077
Oh, shit.
Move it, Raikes!

40:50.239 --> 40:52.367
LT!
Lieutenant, get up!

40:55.119 --> 40:56.496
Lieutenant!

41:04.712 --> 41:06.134
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:21.729 --> 41:22.730
Sir!

41:31.781 --> 41:33.078
Get me the Sampson.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.627
<i>Alpha Bravo.
Sampson, this is Alpha Bravo.</i>

41:38.496 --> 41:40.919
Sir, we're unable to
contact the <i>Sampson.</i>

41:43.835 --> 41:46.930
<i>Reagan control, this is
Rough Rider 4-0-4.</i>

41:47.005 --> 41:49.178
<i>I'm encountering some severe...</i>

41:51.342 --> 41:53.561
Rough Rider 4-0-4, come in.
Do you copy?

41:53.720 --> 41:59.398
Put the force at weapons posture one.
Warning red, weapons tight.

41:59.559 --> 42:01.232
I want everything loaded.

42:09.736 --> 42:10.703
Bridge, what's happened?

42:10.778 --> 42:12.280
My radar's totally down, sir.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.870
We've lost contact with base.
All comms are offline.

42:14.949 --> 42:16.747
It's the North Koreans,
I'm telling you.

42:18.745 --> 42:20.588
Hey, Lieutenant, you good?

42:20.955 --> 42:22.127
Come on, you with me?

42:22.915 --> 42:24.633
Come on. Damn it!

42:24.959 --> 42:26.461
Come on! Squared away?

42:26.544 --> 42:27.545
I'm squared away.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.471
Whatever that thing is,
it killed the battery.

42:29.630 --> 42:30.677
Come on, Beast.

42:34.677 --> 42:35.929
What is that?

42:42.727 --> 42:43.899
That's not good.

43:01.329 --> 43:02.672
What the hell is that?

43:31.192 --> 43:33.570
Do you think that
this could be some

43:33.653 --> 43:37.248
super-secret Navy
surprise exercise?

43:38.032 --> 43:40.785
Because if so, they
have gone way too far.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.388
Let's give them
a warning, Helmsman.

43:56.717 --> 43:58.060
Aye, aye, sir.

44:54.775 --> 44:56.618
What the hell is this?

44:56.986 --> 44:59.739
I didn't sign up for this bullshit!
Yeah, no shit, dude.

44:59.822 --> 45:01.449
Klyvich is offline. Should
be back in two minutes.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.035
Copy that.
Signal the John Paul Jones.

45:04.202 --> 45:07.797
<i>Fire a warning shot. One
round, ten mil, left offset.</i>

45:08.206 --> 45:11.050
Place Mount 51 in remote,
batteries released.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.798
<i>Mount 51 has been designated.</i>

45:12.960 --> 45:15.509
Who are we shooting at?
I do not know.

45:16.589 --> 45:18.307
- Let's move it, Beast.
- She's dead in the water.

45:21.302 --> 45:22.770
Ord, get your ass
to the lee helm.

45:22.845 --> 45:24.313
Aye, sir.

45:25.765 --> 45:27.642
Fire!

46:08.474 --> 46:10.943
Incoming, headed for
the <i>John Paul Jones.</i>

46:12.103 --> 46:13.355
Unknown, inbound
at the horizon.

46:13.521 --> 46:15.319
Vampire, vampire, vampire.
Killing with CIWS.

46:28.786 --> 46:30.880
What kind of chuckwagon...

46:36.043 --> 46:37.169
Were there men out
on that bridge wing?

46:37.253 --> 46:38.800
Yes, sir, there were.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.554
I got it! Firing it up!

46:43.884 --> 46:45.386
Get in there!

46:45.553 --> 46:46.679
Sir!

46:49.890 --> 46:51.517
Light it up!

46:57.898 --> 46:59.150
What the hell is Hopper doing?

46:59.233 --> 47:00.450
All engines, ahead flank.

47:00.526 --> 47:02.528
All engines ahead.
Aye, sir!

47:10.619 --> 47:14.669
Sir, CIC reports both Spy and Fire
control radar cannot lock on.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.425
Fire!
CIC, fire!

47:32.475 --> 47:33.567
Incoming on the right!

47:36.896 --> 47:38.523
Incoming, incoming!

47:39.231 --> 47:40.232
We're hit!

47:54.705 --> 47:56.378
Sir, we have a hull breach.

48:05.383 --> 48:06.509
Help me!

48:08.636 --> 48:10.604
Helmsman, get back on the helm!
Aye, sir.

48:10.763 --> 48:12.106
Rapid, continued fire!

48:36.914 --> 48:38.040
No!

49:04.191 --> 49:06.444
Get me to the <i>John Paul Jones.</i>

49:07.862 --> 49:08.988
NOW!

49:10.114 --> 49:14.164
<i>Bridge reports no survivors
in the water. Sampson, all hands lost.</i>

49:14.326 --> 49:16.420
<i>Targets are holding
defensive formation.</i>

49:16.787 --> 49:19.336
Where's the captain?
Where is he?

49:19.498 --> 49:21.296
What happened? OFFICER:
Captain and XO are dead.

49:21.459 --> 49:22.585
What?

49:22.668 --> 49:25.717
They're dead!
CO and XO are dead.

49:25.880 --> 49:26.927
Who's in charge?

49:30.426 --> 49:31.803
Who's next full senior?

49:32.136 --> 49:33.228
You are.

49:36.474 --> 49:41.446
It's your ship, sir.
You're senior officer, sir.

49:46.025 --> 49:47.868
Sir, if you would please
just give me an order.

49:47.943 --> 49:49.695
I don't know what to do, sir.

50:01.749 --> 50:04.719
We're going in.
Full attack.

50:05.503 --> 50:06.925
That's an order.

50:07.129 --> 50:09.006
Attack, sir? Really?

50:09.173 --> 50:11.221
You wanted an order,
that's the order. Let's go.

50:11.592 --> 50:12.764
Let's go!

50:12.927 --> 50:15.271
- You heard him.
- Aye, aye, sir!

50:18.849 --> 50:20.021
Ready all guns.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.528
Fire control is offline.
I need three minutes.

50:28.943 --> 50:30.741
Tell Nagata I'm going in,
with or without him.

50:37.117 --> 50:38.164
Sir, do you really
want to attack this thing?

50:38.285 --> 50:40.379
Yes! Yes, I do.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.522
Sir, that's a hit!
The <i>Myoko</i> was hit, sir.

51:02.685 --> 51:03.732
Are the weapons ready?

51:03.852 --> 51:05.354
Sir, they have killed everything
that's fired on them.

51:05.437 --> 51:06.905
Get the guns online,
and we ram this thing.

51:06.981 --> 51:09.279
They killed my brother
and every man on his ship!

51:15.322 --> 51:17.120
We have no weapons
to attack with, sir.

51:18.117 --> 51:19.790
Then set course to 3-1-0.

51:19.952 --> 51:21.829
That's a collision course!
Are you clear on that?

51:25.249 --> 51:27.126
Sir, there are
sailors in the water.

51:27.293 --> 51:29.512
Get the guns online and we're
going to ram this thing!

51:35.509 --> 51:36.977
Sir, the <i>Myoko</i> is sinking!

51:37.052 --> 51:39.475
Sir, please!
Set the course to 3-1-0.

51:39.972 --> 51:42.771
There are sailors
in the water, sir!

51:57.406 --> 51:58.623
Hard starboard.

51:58.699 --> 51:59.871
Hard starboard. Aye, sir!

52:03.954 --> 52:05.206
Get them out of the water.

52:05.289 --> 52:06.290
Yes, sir.

52:25.726 --> 52:27.228
What's happening?

52:28.270 --> 52:29.897
Shut up, man.
What the hell is happening?

52:30.064 --> 52:32.738
What the hell are they doing?
Why aren't they attacking?

52:42.618 --> 52:43.790
Are those things aliens?

52:43.869 --> 52:45.371
Would you please shut up?

52:45.454 --> 52:47.456
We need help! We need
to get the carrier over here!

52:50.000 --> 52:51.593
Who's running the ship?
Hopper.

52:51.752 --> 52:53.675
Are you kidding me?
Hopper's running the ship?

52:53.754 --> 52:54.846
This is bullshit.

52:54.922 --> 52:55.923
We're all going to die!

53:03.180 --> 53:04.523
What the hell are those things?

53:08.394 --> 53:09.486
What is that shit?

53:20.447 --> 53:22.620
<i>Comms are down up here.
You got anything?</i>

53:22.783 --> 53:24.456
<i>That's a negative
on all frequencies.</i>

53:42.761 --> 53:43.978
Oh, shit.

53:56.608 --> 53:57.655
Abandon 9-30!

54:21.175 --> 54:22.347
Kill the engines!

54:54.374 --> 54:55.375
Strike!

55:11.183 --> 55:12.730
Hey, Jack!

55:24.279 --> 55:25.326
Dad?

56:08.282 --> 56:09.955
Sir, I can't explain this.

56:10.075 --> 56:11.793
We've lost communication
with everyone

56:11.869 --> 56:13.542
on the other side
of the barrier.

56:13.620 --> 56:16.373
We can't get in and
they can't get out.

56:17.374 --> 56:21.424
The field, whatever it is,
extends about 300,000 feet in altitude

56:21.587 --> 56:23.260
and has a depth of
about two nautical miles.

56:23.630 --> 56:25.803
We are in contact with
Admiral Shane of Pacific Fleet.

56:25.883 --> 56:28.762
Right now, our navy is effectively
trapped outside the area.

56:28.927 --> 56:30.304
So we have nobody in there?

56:30.387 --> 56:34.187
Sir, we have three guided missile
destroyers still unaccounted for.

56:34.558 --> 56:37.562
So, it's conceivable
we do have somebody inside.

56:37.728 --> 56:38.775
Who?

56:52.868 --> 56:54.711
Okay. Thank you!

56:56.663 --> 56:58.711
Captain! Captain!

57:02.836 --> 57:04.588
Let's go! Let's go!

57:46.129 --> 57:48.006
My grandmother could
climb this mountain.

57:48.173 --> 57:49.345
It's a start, Mick.

57:54.763 --> 57:55.764
What was that?

57:57.307 --> 57:58.775
I'm not sure.

58:40.142 --> 58:41.268
What the hell are you
guys doing up here?

58:41.435 --> 58:43.153
I need you off this
mountain, right now.

58:43.311 --> 58:44.528
Wait, what's going on? Why?

58:44.688 --> 58:45.735
The island's under attack.

58:45.814 --> 58:46.815
Attack by who?

58:46.898 --> 58:48.775
I don't know. People are
using the word "aliens."

58:48.900 --> 58:49.992
Aliens?

58:51.028 --> 58:53.531
We don't know. Whatever it is,
it took out the marine base

58:53.613 --> 58:55.786
and all roads leading to this
mountain have been destroyed.

58:55.949 --> 58:59.544
Cell phones, radios, Internet,
everything is shut down.

58:59.703 --> 59:02.297
The Navy's engaged,
just off of the coast.

59:02.372 --> 59:03.419
The Navy?

59:03.498 --> 59:06.297
I need you and your friend off
of this mountain right now.

59:07.961 --> 59:09.053
Come on, let's go.

59:09.129 --> 59:11.598
Vic, leave your car here.
We'll go block the road.

59:26.063 --> 59:27.531
Where are you going?

59:29.232 --> 59:31.360
Mick! Where are you going?

59:31.443 --> 59:35.493
I ain't never seen an alien.
Have you ever seen an alien?

59:35.864 --> 59:38.788
Mick! Don't leave me alone.

59:48.376 --> 59:50.504
Bra, you saw that?
What the hell was that?

59:51.463 --> 59:52.885
Hey, Vince, did you see that?

59:53.048 --> 59:54.265
<i>It looked like a jet.</i>

59:54.424 --> 59:55.550
Bra, I've never...

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.355
Oh, my God! What the hell?

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:28.045
Sir, we need you.

01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:31.049
We need you now.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:33.175
I can't.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:37.847
If you can't...

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.305
Who can?

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:44.892
Captain.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:28.647
Where did we find it?

01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:30.229
One of their
transporters must have crashed

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:32.565
on the way to the island.
There was debris everywhere.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:35.150
Thomas and Potts fished him right out
of the water with a grappling hook.

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:37.445
I told them it was a bad
idea, but they kept yanking.

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:39.284
I kept telling them "no,"
and they kept...

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:42.741
Hmm...

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:08.767
Oh...

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:16.733
God damn it!

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:25.996
Beast, flashlight.

01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:33.004
My dad said they would come.
He said it my whole life.

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:37.344
He said, "We ain't alone."

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.723
He said, "One day
we would find them,"

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.637
"or they would find us."

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:48.981
You know what else he said?

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:53.145
He said...

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:56.864
"I hope I ain't around
when that day comes."

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:03.196
He's not dead!
He's not dead!

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:05.623
Not dead! Not dead!

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.357
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.734
What kind of bad feeling?

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:26.701
Like, "We're going to need a new
planet" kind of bad feeling.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:31.497
<i>Medical
casualty, C-53. Two men down.</i>

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:32.702
They're still on the ship.

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:35.455
Lock down the ship!

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:47.847
- Is everyone all right?
- All good, Chief.

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:49.553
Is everyone accounted for?

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:55.309
<i>Just
heard something on Level Four.</i>

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.207
Raikes, up.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.136
Hey! Move, move!

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:29.809
What do you see?

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.220
Did you see it?

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:33.346
No, sir.
I got nothing, sir!

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.265
Nothing.

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.062
How is he?

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:38.268
Not good, sir. Not good.

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.945
You two, get him
to medical, now!

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.272
Raikes, you're with me.
Let's go!

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:34.533
Get out of here!

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:09.734
No!

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:03.705
Yo! Hey!

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:24.813
Raikes...

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.444
Get your ass to CIC.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.817
NOW!

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:34.368
Come on.

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.024
Raikes, you better be there.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:24.085
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:40.259
<i>Mahalo</i>, mother...

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:31.819
We got to get
off this mountain.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:34.818
The cop left the keys
on his belt.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.991
You've got to go
down and get them.

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:43.156
You can do it.

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.130
Now.

01:12:27.969 --> 01:12:31.599
This is an emergency call.
Can anyone hear me?

01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:35.603
Radio check.
Can anyone hear me? Over.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:37.361
Hey, wait up!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.863
Stop right there!
Don't shoot!

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.113
Who are you?

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.692
I'm Cal Zapata.
We sent out a beacon.

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:47.367
Oh, shit, is he a cyborg?
Are you guys with them?

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:57.799
If he's human, could you
have him put the gun down?

01:12:57.957 --> 01:12:59.129
Mick, put your gun down.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.801
I told them that something
like this could happen.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.803
I said, it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians,

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.555
or the Conquistadors
and the Incans.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.678
They just thought,
"No, they will be sweet."

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:09.310
They killed my grad student.

01:13:12.513 --> 01:13:14.515
Okay, calm down.
I can't.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:17.185
Slow. Sit down.
I can't breathe.

01:13:17.351 --> 01:13:18.603
Slow breaths, slow breaths.

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:20.358
You're freaking him out, Mick.

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:22.532
I doubt it takes
much to freak him out.

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:25.826
We need the Marines. We need the Army.
We need all of them.

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:29.914
<i>It is the strong
belief of the Chinese</i>

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:31.081
<i>that what crashed
into Hong Kong</i>

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.835
<i>was some sort of
communications ship.</i>

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:39.170
You're saying that
a flying telephone cratered

01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:41.505
and took out 25,000 people?

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:45.054
<i>What I'm saying is that our visitors
seem extraordinarily concerned</i>

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:47.678
<i>with establishing a line
of communication home.</i>

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.093
If they have lost their communication
ship, how could they do that?

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:51.302
<i>The same way we did.</i>

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:54.139
<i>Our communications station
in Hawaii has the ability</i>

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:57.816
<i>to send a message to deep space
via the Landsat 7 satellite.</i>

01:13:57.975 --> 01:14:01.605
<i>I believe it's for that asset
they have domed the islands.</i>

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:06.947
<i>We're looking at
an extinction-level event.</i>

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:12.324
The most critical part
of any military operation.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:16.536
Establish communications,
reinforcements, follow-on forces.

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.504
You're saying E.T.
wants to phone home?

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:21.882
That would be incredibly,
incredibly bad.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.586
So far, only five ships
have made contact.

01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:27.130
If five ships can do this,
what do you think 50 can do,

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:30.092
or 500 or 5,000 or 500,000?

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.239
<i>Sir, if I could
just have a minute.</i>

01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:50.904
If you'll just
give me one second...

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.702
Why am I staring at a lizard?

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:56.830
Because this is my pet lizard, sir.
Penelope the Third.

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:59.462
And? And they have
the exact same eyes.

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:00.663
You have 15 seconds. Go.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.503
Okay, sir, I put the helmet on,

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:05.710
and the helmet is, basically,
extreme sunglasses.

01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:08.504
And it's some hydration
and some oxygen saturation,

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:09.839
and a bunch of other stuff
I don't understand.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:12.971
But we took Penelope to the beach one
time, which was a terrible idea.

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:16.020
She went absolutely crazy because
she can't handle the sunlight.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:18.306
You see? I don't think that they
can handle the sunlight either.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.771
You try anything else on?

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.732
Negative, sir.

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:26.113
Just the helmet.
Just the helmet.

01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:30.697
<i>Scientists have confirmed
there was a UFO landing</i>

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:33.325
<i>in the Pacific Ocean,
off the coast of Hawaii.</i>

01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:34.993
<i>Today I want to update
the American people</i>

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:37.916
<i>on what we know about
the situation in Hawaii.</i>

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:42.331
<i>First, we are bringing all
available resources to bear.</i>

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:59.643
<i>The news has sparked
global unrest as populations panic,</i>

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:03.059
<i>unleashing an unprecedented
wave of chaos across the world.</i>

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:06.445
<i>Many governments have
declared martial law.</i>

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:08.823
<i>Just scramble
the jets, Admiral.</i>

01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:10.733
We need to get in there!

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:13.615
I'm far from more aware than you
of the need to get inside there.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:15.492
<i>But wasting lives
will not help.</i>

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.993
<i>You want me to
send up another plane?</i>

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:18.536
I'll do it the second
you come up here

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:22.166
and put your ass in
the co-pilot's seat, sir!

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:32.805
Are they transmitting?

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.804
They could be, but it
wouldn't do them any good.

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:39.353
There's no satellite
to receive the transmission.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:41.264
We beam to Landsat 7.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:42.765
What's Landsat 7?

01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:45.481
It's our deep-space satellite.

01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:49.651
It only orbits into range
once every 24 hours.

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:51.607
When is the satellite
in position?

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.692
8:43 a.m.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:55.076
We've got about five hours.

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:57.780
And then they will use it to
slingshot their transmission.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:59.156
Slingshot where?

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:01.618
I don't know.
Wherever it is they're from.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:10.501
Pearl Harbor here,
we're approximately here,

01:17:10.668 --> 01:17:13.217
and they, whatever they are,
are somewhere in the middle.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.722
We're trapped out here.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.678
What we know right now
is we can't target them

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:18.430
unless we have
a plain line of sight.

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:21.058
Without radar, we have no
way to track them, correct?

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:25.062
Correct. But I don't think
they can see us, either.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:27.477
Why?
Because we are still alive.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.904
Okay, so they can't see us
and we can't see them.

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:32.156
And we have no way to hit
them from a safe distance.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.743
There is a way.
A way?

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:38.571
A way of seeing them,
without seeing them.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.831
You're going to reference <i>Art
of War</i> right now, aren't you?

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:42.867
What are we supposed to do, fight
the enemy where they aren't?

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:44.327
Move like water?

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.666
Because I've read that thing six times.
It makes no sense.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:48.331
That book is Chinese.

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:51.751
It still makes no sense.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.428
My way is much more simple.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.382
We've been doing it to
America for 20 years.

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:00.976
Water displacement.

01:18:01.135 --> 01:18:02.933
How do you track
water displacement?

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:05.598
Tsunami buoys.
Tsunami buoys?

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:08.525
You have them
surrounding your islands,

01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.444
transmitting displacement data.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:13.106
We hack into their
transmissions, form a grid.

01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:14.899
You can't track
anything without radar.

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:16.825
I don't need radar.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:19.195
Just the radio frequencies.

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:21.580
Turn off Aegis radar, please.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:24.951
Who is this guy?

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:27.040
- Chief Moore.
- Sir.

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:28.545
Secure SPY.

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:29.793
Securing SPY, sir.

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:36.469
Display NOAA data.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:40.807
NOAA data?

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:42.309
That's correct.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:46.222
You heard him.
Display NOAA data.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.321
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:55.943
<i>It's a buoy.</i>

01:18:56.649 --> 01:19:00.699
<i>If it gets hit by a wave,
it transmits a signal.</i>

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.745
Bring up chart plot.

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:13.044
Chart plot. Bring it up.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.268
So we can track without radar.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.730
We would practice it
as a contingency plan.

01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:34.941
You dirty, cheating, sneaky...

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.526
Rough world.

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:39.115
I like it.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.152
Captain.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:44.955
My chair is your chair, sir.

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:04.470
My brother would
have done the same.

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:13.435
I wish we could
get a hold of Hopper.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.852
Who's Hopper?

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:16.687
He's a tactical actions officer

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:18.613
on an Arleigh Burke
class destroyer.

01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:23.286
It has the resources that could
take this entire mountain out.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:26.159
Great, that makes a lot of sense.
Let's call him.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.915
We can't.
Everything is jammed.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:30.952
They're using an electromagnetic
field to block our signals.

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:35.419
It's more like a pulse, it's not a brick wall.
There are gaps, okay?

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:38.004
From inside the barrier we might
just be able to get a call out.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:40.711
If I could get to my spectrum
analyzer, then, theoretically,

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:42.425
we could find a frequency
we could broadcast on...

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:45.933
Do you have a piece of equipment
that can make a call?

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:48.093
Yeah.
Get it.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:52.515
I can't because it's down
there, in that nest of aliens.

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.274
You're going to go get it.

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:55.351
No.

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:56.936
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:06.362
We are looking for patterns
of water displacement.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:27.470
That buoy is underwater.

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:39.399
That's a ship.

01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:41.606
Get on your gun.
Yes, sir.

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:57.254
Target, Echo-1-1.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.540
Roger. Echo 1-1.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:01.458
Ready to fire.

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:05.172
When we fire,
they will know where we are.

01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:19.184
Fire!

01:22:44.334 --> 01:22:45.335
Ordy, anything?

01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:47.262
<i>Negative, sir.
It's a miss.</i>

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:55.684
It's heading towards us.

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:00.230
You ready?

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:05.448
I'm sorry, but there is no possible
way that I'm going down there.

01:23:05.522 --> 01:23:07.445
I do not possess
that kind of courage.

01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:10.361
Right now, you're going
to acquire that courage,

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:13.406
or I'm going to break my
steel leg off into your ass.

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:16.959
You feel me?

01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:19.628
I feel you.

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:22.084
Go, now.

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:25.255
Acquiring courage.

01:23:26.543 --> 01:23:28.216
Acquiring courage.

01:24:58.594 --> 01:24:59.595
What?

01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:07.982
Foxtrot, 2-4.

01:25:08.061 --> 01:25:09.187
Foxtrot, 2-4.

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:10.571
Ready to fire.
Fire!

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:22.664
Ordy, anything?

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:23.952
<i>Negative, sir.</i>

01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:25.959
It's a stupid, nincompoop idea.

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.008
There's another one.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:56.201
<i>Incoming, incoming! Sir,
they're coming from both directions!</i>

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:00.455
Engines, back, full.

01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:14.507
Incoming, incoming, incoming!

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.272
India 3-7.

01:26:26.556 --> 01:26:28.229
India 3-7. Loaded.

01:26:28.975 --> 01:26:30.818
Second coordinate,
Romeo, 2-6.

01:26:30.894 --> 01:26:31.941
Romeo 2-6.

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:38.451
Sir, we're hot over here.
Missiles good to go.

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:40.283
Let's light them up,
Captain Nagata.

01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:52.586
Captain Nagata.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:57.379
Fire!

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:30.245
Holy shit!
A hit, sir! Hit!

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:40.389
<i>Any station this net, any station
this net, this is a call for help.</i>

01:27:40.547 --> 01:27:44.597
<i>Any warship, police or military
personnel, please respond, over.</i>

01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:46.724
<i>This is U. S.S.
John Paul Jones,</i>

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:48.100
<i>state your identity
and position. Over.</i>

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.352
Hopper?

01:27:49.431 --> 01:27:50.432
Sam?

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:52.268
<i>Sam, are you okay?
Where are you?</i>

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:53.943
Thank God. I'm okay.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:59.525
Listen, they're here at the satellite
array at Saddle Ridge, do you copy?

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:03.369
<i>They're going to transmit a signal
and establish communication.</i>

01:28:03.528 --> 01:28:07.203
You need to destroy the facility.
We have four hours.

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:08.708
Four hours, I copy.

01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:14.039
Hopper.

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:17.000
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:21.262
Babe, you need to
get out of there.

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:23.969
Hopper? Hopper?

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.518
No, they're gone.
They're gone.

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:28.015
We better get gone, too.

01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:29.680
I'm thinking an Arleigh
Burke class destroyer

01:28:29.763 --> 01:28:32.357
is about to rain hell
down on this mountaintop.

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:44.870
Are you ready to
kill another one?

01:28:49.533 --> 01:28:50.750
Tango 1-9.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:53.583
Tango 1-9. Loaded.

01:28:57.457 --> 01:28:58.583
Whiskey 2-5.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.093
Whiskey 2-5.

01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:09.803
Raikes, can you get
a track on their ship?

01:29:09.886 --> 01:29:12.014
Negative, sir, it's
moving all over the place.

01:29:12.097 --> 01:29:14.099
I can't get a line on it.

01:29:26.236 --> 01:29:27.613
This sucker's
really jumping around.

01:29:28.405 --> 01:29:29.782
Very intelligent.

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:40.759
What time is sunrise?

01:29:40.834 --> 01:29:42.461
Forty minutes, sir.

01:29:43.169 --> 01:29:45.638
Let's take these bastards
somewhere they don't want to go.

01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:50.844
<i>General quarters,
general quarters.</i>

01:29:50.927 --> 01:29:52.349
<i>All hands, man
your battle stations.</i>

01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:55.854
I need to know when we round this
point if we can hold her tight.

01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:57.434
Right around
Diamond Head, here.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.988
There's a brutal current there.

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.986
It will take a miracle
to keep her off the reef.

01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:08.995
Ordy, is it possible?
Can you do it?

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:10.371
It's not impossible.

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:12.123
Sir, I can try,
but I don't know what...

01:30:12.198 --> 01:30:13.495
Can you do it, yes or no?

01:30:16.995 --> 01:30:19.748
Contact is seven miles out,
and closing fast.

01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:21.292
Yes, sir, I can do it.

01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:23.509
Check safe, check clear.
Check safe, check clear.

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:24.802
Get some.

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:27.096
Captain Nagata,
how good is your aim?

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:28.515
Excellent.

01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:33.678
- All right, let's start this turn!
- Aye, sir!

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:35.514
Left, hard rudder!
Left, hard rudder, sir!

01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:41.482
How are we looking?
It's all reef.

01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:45.065
Ordy, you are way
too close! Come left!

01:30:45.148 --> 01:30:46.149
Easy...

01:30:47.025 --> 01:30:49.574
We're about to kiss
these rocks, Ordy!

01:30:49.653 --> 01:30:50.779
Ordy!

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:00.960
Where did you learn to shoot?

01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:03.041
I'm not sure how
you say it in English.

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:04.835
<i>Natsu campu.</i>

01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:06.719
<i>Summer campu.</i>

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.846
- How about now?
- Still a little tight.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:12.309
I can see fish, Ordy.
Come on, man.

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:14.469
Contact, two miles out.

01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:16.304
Contact ETA, 21 seconds.

01:31:16.596 --> 01:31:18.348
Summer camp...

01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:21.234
Contact, 700 yards out.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.403
Summer camp.

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:26.982
Champion, when I was 12.

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:28.863
Are you kidding me?

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:30.281
Here we go.

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:41.045
On my mark.

01:31:44.874 --> 01:31:46.091
Three.

01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:48.920
Two.

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:52.382
One.

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:01.896
Light them up.

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:21.832
Boom.

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:43.184
<i>Three miles
until Saddle Ridge is within range.</i>

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:44.476
Status of weps.

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:47.062
Sir, they're bringing up all the
rounds from the lower mag right now.

01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:48.192
Sir.

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:57.413
Clear the bridge.
Clear the bridge!

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:09.959
Shit!

01:33:43.326 --> 01:33:46.546
Ordy, get up! Let's go!

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:49.499
Go, go, go!

01:33:54.712 --> 01:33:55.964
We've got two down, sir!

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:57.173
Get up.

01:34:03.847 --> 01:34:06.726
Go, go, go!
Get in the water! Go!

01:34:07.433 --> 01:34:08.855
It's going down!

01:34:25.702 --> 01:34:26.919
Come on.

01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:49.685
Raikes!

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.279
Right here!
You're almost there, come on!

01:35:45.949 --> 01:35:47.542
Let's go, we have to jump!

01:36:09.389 --> 01:36:11.232
That's the <i>John Paul Jones.</i>

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:14.106
That's Hopper.

01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:18.944
Relax, Sam. I'm seeing a lot
of lifeboats in the water.

01:36:21.859 --> 01:36:24.362
You say that satellite will be
in position in three hours?

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:25.446
Yeah, that's correct.

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:27.786
So if they miss it,
they have to wait.

01:36:28.825 --> 01:36:31.248
My uplink never misses.
It's not going to miss.

01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:32.788
How are your driving skills?

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:35.123
What does that mean? How are my driving skills?
They're horrible.

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:36.883
Not your driving.

01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:40.511
Sam, how are your
driving skills?

01:36:40.670 --> 01:36:41.922
Good.

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:45.050
Let's see if we can't buy
the world another day.

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:47.306
Who talks like that?

01:36:47.677 --> 01:36:49.350
Just get in the vehicle.
Let's go.

01:36:49.429 --> 01:36:51.648
I'm not getting in.
This is your show, now.

01:36:51.723 --> 01:36:53.475
I don't have a death wish,
thank you very much.

01:36:53.599 --> 01:36:54.725
Goodbye, everyone.

01:36:55.018 --> 01:36:57.521
Stop! Stop.

01:37:00.690 --> 01:37:02.442
This is my property.

01:38:19.852 --> 01:38:21.445
It doesn't end like this.

01:38:26.025 --> 01:38:27.823
What do you want
us to do, Hopper?

01:38:30.238 --> 01:38:31.706
We have no ships left.

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.326
We have one.

01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:44.586
We have got a battleship.

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:49.390
Are you crazy?
That's a museum.

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:52.469
Not today.

01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:04.565
This ship is 70 years old.
It's totally outdated.

01:39:04.730 --> 01:39:07.483
The firing systems
are all analog.

01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:09.448
The engines haven't been
started in a decade.

01:39:09.569 --> 01:39:11.071
Which would be fine,
but they are steam,

01:39:11.154 --> 01:39:13.407
which I have no idea
how to fire up.

01:39:13.573 --> 01:39:15.166
And even if I had
a user's manual

01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:16.743
and six weeks to
go through it all,

01:39:16.909 --> 01:39:19.628
we still don't have
enough crew to fire it up.

01:39:20.246 --> 01:39:21.748
I don't know what
you're thinking, sir.

01:39:58.117 --> 01:39:59.289
Is everyone all right?

01:39:59.368 --> 01:40:01.837
Yes, sir. We're okay.

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:09.670
You men have given so much
to your country,

01:40:09.754 --> 01:40:12.348
and no one has the right
to ask any more of you,

01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:15.142
but I'm asking.

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:17.686
What do you need, son?

01:40:18.596 --> 01:40:20.849
I need to borrow your boat.

01:40:44.789 --> 01:40:45.961
Son.

01:40:49.961 --> 01:40:50.962
Sir.

01:40:51.045 --> 01:40:52.763
What the hell? Are you going
to stand there, staring at me?

01:40:52.838 --> 01:40:54.761
Get your goddamn eye
on that spotter!

01:40:54.924 --> 01:40:56.346
Eye on spotter, sir.

01:40:59.136 --> 01:41:00.979
Been working on a
destroyer, haven't you?

01:41:01.055 --> 01:41:02.056
Yes, sir.

01:41:02.139 --> 01:41:03.857
Are you ready to play
with the big boys?

01:41:04.058 --> 01:41:05.059
Oh, yes, sir.

01:41:05.142 --> 01:41:06.485
Come on.
We need the help.

01:41:06.561 --> 01:41:07.608
Awesome!

01:41:09.397 --> 01:41:11.365
Best cover your ears.

01:41:19.824 --> 01:41:20.996
Purrs like a kitten.

01:41:21.409 --> 01:41:24.413
Bridge, main control.
I got eight boilers hot.

01:41:24.495 --> 01:41:25.838
Ready to rock and roll, sir.

01:41:25.913 --> 01:41:27.256
How are we looking on fuel?

01:41:27.331 --> 01:41:30.676
600 long tons, sir. Just
enough for a maintenance run.

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:31.843
Ordnance?

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:34.263
We scraped together what we could, sir.
But it's not much.

01:41:34.422 --> 01:41:36.049
All right, let's get her to sea.
We have got work to do.

01:41:36.132 --> 01:41:37.133
Roger that.

01:41:59.697 --> 01:42:00.994
Engines ahead, flank.

01:42:01.073 --> 01:42:02.791
All engines ahead, flank.

01:42:02.867 --> 01:42:04.540
All engines ahead, flank.
Aye, sir.

01:42:18.883 --> 01:42:20.009
You good?

01:42:20.092 --> 01:42:21.594
Good, sir.
Good, sir.

01:42:21.677 --> 01:42:22.678
Good.

01:42:49.288 --> 01:42:50.414
Status of turret one?

01:42:52.083 --> 01:42:53.676
Center line, barrel, armed.

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:00.467
- Stop!
- Clear!

01:43:01.467 --> 01:43:02.684
Loaded.

01:43:03.427 --> 01:43:05.145
<i>Status of turret two?</i>

01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:07.432
Starboard side, armed.

01:43:10.935 --> 01:43:12.858
<i>Status of turret three?</i>

01:43:12.937 --> 01:43:14.234
Port barrel.
Ready to rock and roll.

01:43:14.397 --> 01:43:15.649
Port side, armed!

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:17.783
Sir, are we really
firing on Oahu?

01:43:17.942 --> 01:43:19.068
Sure looks that way.

01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:20.403
Holy shit!

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:39.305
<i>Saddle Ridge will be in
weapons range in five minutes.</i>

01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:42.137
Oh, brother, somebody is
going to kiss the donkey.

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:47.100
Hopper!

01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:03.613
I didn't think that one moved.

01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:06.282
Me neither.

01:44:46.655 --> 01:44:48.373
My God.

01:44:48.532 --> 01:44:49.704
Are you kidding me?

01:45:26.695 --> 01:45:27.821
<i>Art of War.</i>

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:34.836
<i>Fire control, weapons status?</i>

01:45:34.912 --> 01:45:35.959
Aimed at target.

01:45:36.038 --> 01:45:39.508
Train all three
turrets to 2-1-0.

01:45:41.502 --> 01:45:43.004
<i>But, sir,
that's the wrong direction!</i>

01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:44.384
I'm well aware of that, Raikes.

01:45:58.519 --> 01:45:59.771
What the hell is he doing?

01:45:59.854 --> 01:46:01.447
He's losing his mind,
all over again.

01:46:08.362 --> 01:46:09.454
Hard left rudder.

01:46:09.613 --> 01:46:11.615
Hard left rudder. Aye, sir.

01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:47.151
Drop port anchor.
What?

01:46:51.655 --> 01:46:52.998
Drop it now!

01:46:57.828 --> 01:46:59.171
We are going to die.

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:04.501
We are going to die.

01:47:08.088 --> 01:47:10.261
You are going to die.
I am going to die.

01:47:13.677 --> 01:47:14.678
We are all going to die.

01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:20.476
Just not today.

01:47:40.037 --> 01:47:42.165
Let's drop some
lead on those mother...

01:47:42.331 --> 01:47:43.332
Fire!

01:47:58.722 --> 01:47:59.974
Reload! Reload!

01:48:00.057 --> 01:48:02.105
Firing mechanism reset!
Secure the hatch.

01:48:02.184 --> 01:48:03.151
Port side ready!

01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:04.319
Release the anchor.

01:48:19.034 --> 01:48:20.081
Incoming! Incoming!

01:48:36.468 --> 01:48:37.515
You all right?

01:48:37.594 --> 01:48:39.517
They ain't going to sink
this battleship, no way.

01:48:39.596 --> 01:48:40.722
Hit it!

01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:53.610
Everything you've got!

01:49:00.993 --> 01:49:01.994
Whoo!

01:49:17.676 --> 01:49:21.647
I want every available plane
on this ship in the air, now!

01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:28.403
I can't believe that worked!

01:49:28.479 --> 01:49:31.107
Yeah, Art of <i>War.</i> Fight the
enemy where they aren't.

01:49:31.190 --> 01:49:33.113
After all these years,
that finally just clicked.

01:49:33.192 --> 01:49:35.160
But that's not what it means.

01:49:35.652 --> 01:49:36.619
Really?

01:49:36.695 --> 01:49:38.538
Not even close.

01:50:17.194 --> 01:50:18.571
Keep going!

01:50:20.864 --> 01:50:22.036
Oh, shit!

01:50:33.377 --> 01:50:34.549
Mick, my leg is stuck.

01:50:42.886 --> 01:50:43.933
Mick!

01:50:46.265 --> 01:50:47.437
Status of weapons?

01:50:47.516 --> 01:50:48.563
<i>Turret three is down.</i>

01:50:48.725 --> 01:50:52.025
We got one round of high-explosive
back-aft in turret three.

01:50:53.021 --> 01:50:55.740
Tell them to have it
ready when we get there.

01:51:01.238 --> 01:51:02.740
I got this.

01:51:13.876 --> 01:51:15.002
Beast, update.

01:51:16.253 --> 01:51:18.676
I need that round. We need
to bring it to turret two.

01:51:18.755 --> 01:51:21.008
Sir?
Turret two is 500 feet away.

01:51:21.091 --> 01:51:22.513
This round is over
a thousand pounds!

01:51:22.593 --> 01:51:24.015
How do you expect
us to get it there?

01:53:12.494 --> 01:53:15.043
Raikes! Get to the gun plot,
finger on the trigger.

01:53:15.205 --> 01:53:17.003
Yes, sir.
Come on, easy. Easy.

01:53:17.165 --> 01:53:18.838
Gentle, boys.
Gentle, gentle.

01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:31.563
Get out of here!

01:53:35.392 --> 01:53:36.393
We got to go.

01:53:37.144 --> 01:53:40.239
Calm down, okay? I'm going
to frigging save you.

01:53:50.157 --> 01:53:51.534
Closed, number one is armed.

01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:53.418
Coordinates?
Train, 3-3-0.

01:53:53.577 --> 01:53:56.080
Elevation?
2-2-0.

01:54:05.922 --> 01:54:07.048
There! Go!

01:54:08.091 --> 01:54:09.559
Let's go!

01:54:12.346 --> 01:54:13.347
She's armed.

01:54:13.764 --> 01:54:15.892
You better not be up there.

01:54:16.391 --> 01:54:18.234
Let's go! Come on!

01:54:22.022 --> 01:54:23.239
Hopper!

01:54:35.452 --> 01:54:37.796
We only have one
round left, right?

01:54:37.954 --> 01:54:39.001
Yeah.

01:54:49.966 --> 01:54:52.310
It was an honor serving
with you, Captain.

01:54:55.097 --> 01:54:56.644
The honor was mine.

01:55:01.645 --> 01:55:03.397
Fire.
Fire.

01:55:52.863 --> 01:55:53.864
Locked on target.

01:56:22.851 --> 01:56:24.603
<i>We take great pride in honoring</i>

01:56:24.686 --> 01:56:28.657
<i>the many men and women who
demonstrated exceptional gallantry</i>

01:56:29.316 --> 01:56:32.411
<i>in the face of
overwhelming enemy force.</i>

01:56:32.569 --> 01:56:36.244
<i>Valor and courage
were exhibited by so many</i>

01:56:36.698 --> 01:56:38.826
<i>that I cannot honor them all.</i>

01:56:39.075 --> 01:56:41.373
<i>It is my great
privilege to recognize</i>

01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:45.716
<i>those few whose actions
deserve special note.</i>

01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:50.178
<i>Lieutenant Colonel, United States
Army, retired, Mick Canales.</i>

01:57:02.724 --> 01:57:05.603
<i>The President of the United
States takes great pleasure</i>

01:57:05.769 --> 01:57:09.444
<i>in presenting the Navy Cross

01:57:09.773 --> 01:57:11.946
<i>for extraordinary heroism.</i>

01:57:12.108 --> 01:57:15.533
<i>Receiving this award,
on behalf of his brother,</i>

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:17.789
<i>Lieutenant
Commander Alex Hopper.</i>

01:57:36.883 --> 01:57:39.136
Stand fast, Mr. Hopper.

01:57:42.472 --> 01:57:46.522
<i>It is my great pleasure to
present you with a Silver Star</i>

01:57:46.685 --> 01:57:51.316
<i>for your exceptional heroism and
gallantry in combat operations.</i>

01:58:03.535 --> 01:58:05.458
And I look forward
to seeing you at sea

01:58:05.537 --> 01:58:08.211
on a ship of your
own command, soon.

01:58:18.049 --> 01:58:19.926
Thank you.

01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:26.608
Ordy, stop talking
for a second.

01:58:26.683 --> 01:58:27.775
Come on, take
the picture, Beast.

01:58:27.934 --> 01:58:29.857
Say "Navy."
Navy!

01:58:34.608 --> 01:58:35.951
Mildly impressive, Hopper.

01:58:36.026 --> 01:58:37.619
You ready to get your <i>ass</i>
off that big gray monster,

01:58:37.694 --> 01:58:39.662
get out to Coronado and get your
hands dirty with the big boys?

01:58:39.738 --> 01:58:41.115
Yes, sir. You think
you've got what it takes?

01:58:41.197 --> 01:58:42.949
I hope so, sir.
Call me, Hopper.

01:58:43.033 --> 01:58:44.704
It just might be too
much sleep, though, sir.

01:58:44.705 --> 01:58:46.044
A little too much sleep for you?
Yes, sir.

01:58:46.119 --> 01:58:47.120
We will have to see about that.

01:58:47.203 --> 01:58:49.672
Come on, Hopper,
cozy up to Nagata.

01:58:49.748 --> 01:58:51.091
You look so cute.

01:58:51.249 --> 01:58:52.876
You guys make a great couple.
Are we dating now?

01:58:52.959 --> 01:58:54.381
You look dapper.

01:58:54.544 --> 01:58:56.171
"Navy. " Say, "Navy."

01:58:56.254 --> 01:58:57.972
Yeah, I don't know.

01:58:58.048 --> 01:58:59.300
Oh!

01:58:59.382 --> 01:59:00.508
Bad timing.

01:59:00.675 --> 01:59:02.518
Congratulations.
Thank you.

01:59:02.594 --> 01:59:03.811
How are you?
Good, how are you?

01:59:03.887 --> 01:59:05.184
I love you.
I love you.

01:59:05.347 --> 01:59:06.974
I'm a pretty lucky guy,
you know that?

01:59:07.057 --> 01:59:09.856
Which is why I think it's a perfect
time for you to talk to my dad.

01:59:09.934 --> 01:59:12.858
Where is he? I wish he
was standing right here.

01:59:13.021 --> 01:59:15.149
That's perfect, because look!

01:59:15.732 --> 01:59:18.611
Your wish came true,
honey. Go get him.

01:59:21.029 --> 01:59:23.031
Thumbs up, that helps.

01:59:24.908 --> 01:59:25.909
Sir.

01:59:27.077 --> 01:59:28.294
What is it?

01:59:29.412 --> 01:59:32.586
I want you to know
that I am in love with Sam.

01:59:35.710 --> 01:59:39.760
And I am asking your permission
to marry your daughter.

01:59:43.426 --> 01:59:44.473
No.

01:59:44.552 --> 01:59:46.554
Thank you, sir.
I mean, it's...

01:59:47.722 --> 01:59:49.599
What?
No.

01:59:51.434 --> 01:59:52.777
Sir...

01:59:54.145 --> 01:59:56.489
I saved the world.

01:59:57.148 --> 02:00:00.823
Saving the world is one thing, Hopper.
My daughter is quite another.

02:00:01.945 --> 02:00:05.449
But...
No means no, Hopper.

02:00:05.615 --> 02:00:07.788
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for lunch.

02:00:08.618 --> 02:00:11.622
I think I will have
a chicken burrito.

02:00:13.248 --> 02:00:14.465
Chicken...

02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:16.797
Sir.

02:00:19.838 --> 02:00:21.215
Come along, Hopper.

02:00:21.297 --> 02:00:23.925
We will discuss the terms
of your surrender over a meal.

02:00:26.136 --> 02:00:27.308
Yes, sir.

02:00:29.597 --> 02:00:30.974
She told you about that?

02:09:39.772 --> 02:09:41.820
You got nothing on Jay-Z.

02:09:42.733 --> 02:09:44.201
I mean, even I
couldn't get Beyoncé.

02:09:44.277 --> 02:09:45.654
I couldn't get Beyoncé either.

02:09:45.736 --> 02:09:46.862
No way.

02:09:47.613 --> 02:09:48.614
Whoa.

02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:50.866
What the...

02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:52.668
What is that?

02:10:00.001 --> 02:10:01.298
Don't get too close to it.

02:10:01.377 --> 02:10:04.756
Whoa, guys! Look at this!

02:10:04.922 --> 02:10:07.141
- Don't go too close!
- Don't run to it.

02:10:07.216 --> 02:10:08.809
- Do you think that looks like a door?
- A door?

02:10:08.884 --> 02:10:10.636
Hello?
Anyone home?

02:10:11.595 --> 02:10:12.938
That's not
going to help, is it?

02:10:14.432 --> 02:10:16.400
This really helps.

02:10:23.065 --> 02:10:24.908
Do you know what that is?

02:10:25.067 --> 02:10:26.910
We think there's
something inside of it.

02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:28.241
Are going to open it, Jimmy?

02:10:28.321 --> 02:10:31.666
If Jimmy says he's getting
in, he's getting in!

02:10:41.792 --> 02:10:43.465
Come on, Jimmy!
Whoo!

02:10:43.627 --> 02:10:44.970
Jimmy!

02:10:45.129 --> 02:10:48.099
That's it. Come to daddy.

02:10:51.761 --> 02:10:53.354
Jimmy! Oh, my God!

02:10:53.429 --> 02:10:54.476
Yes!
