WEBVTT

00:02.124 --> 00:04.591
And then in the season finale,

00:04.687 --> 00:06.574
they reveal the whole thing
was a dream,

00:06.592 --> 00:07.928
when the Inspector wakes up

00:07.947 --> 00:12.136
next to a very young
and very topless Cheryl Tiegs.

00:13.104 --> 00:14.642
Even Pierce loves
this show now?

00:14.655 --> 00:15.745
It's not <i>Inspector Spacetime.</i>

00:15.763 --> 00:17.691
It's the American version,
and it's a travesty.

00:17.705 --> 00:19.395
It's broad, obvious, sexist,
and the timing is...

00:19.407 --> 00:21.396
Honey, I'm dean!

00:21.408 --> 00:22.865
What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:22.890 --> 00:25.722
Oh, Jeffrey, you are too much.

00:25.741 --> 00:27.943
Why, I was doing some
house cleaning the other day...

00:27.955 --> 00:30.804
"Deana Reed" style...
When I realized, "gosh, golly,

00:30.822 --> 00:33.448
it's been ages since we had
a dance."

00:33.473 --> 00:37.130
So, this Friday we are going
back to Greendale's golden age

00:37.136 --> 00:39.386
with an old-fashioned sock hop!

00:40.605 --> 00:42.243
The health department requires
you wear shoes.

00:42.461 --> 00:44.067
What a "coincidean."

00:44.161 --> 00:46.325
You're throwing a dance the
same day the CDC is confiscating

00:46.344 --> 00:47.926
our drinking fountains.
- Well...

00:47.938 --> 00:49.610
Placating students
with a fun event.

00:49.635 --> 00:50.904
Classic bread and circuses.

00:50.928 --> 00:52.679
In Ancient Rome, the emperor
would distract the populace

00:52.697 --> 00:55.519
from their problems by allocating
money for free bread and circuses.

00:55.562 --> 00:58.262
I've been making a conscious effort to get
away from filtering everything through TV.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.646
I figured it's time I showed some growth.
It's been three and a half seasons...

01:00.684 --> 01:01.793
Is what the old me
would have said.

01:01.818 --> 01:02.618
- Oh.
- Aww.

01:02.635 --> 01:05.311
Anyhoo, it is
a Sadie Hawkins dance,

01:05.324 --> 01:08.489
which means girls ask the boys.
Oh, I love those!

01:08.514 --> 01:11.703
So, ladies, get out there
and make yourselves useful.

01:11.734 --> 01:13.528
So you're saying
there's one day a year

01:13.553 --> 01:15.370
when women are free
to choose their own mates.

01:15.395 --> 01:17.498
What is this,
cave-person times?

01:17.531 --> 01:20.089
Well, I have already started
on a Sadie Hawkins banner,

01:20.113 --> 01:22.004
so this thing is
pretty much set in stone.

01:22.022 --> 01:23.714
Well, then maybe I'll throw
my own dance,

01:23.733 --> 01:26.555
one that doesn't conform
to your oppressive gender norms.

01:26.636 --> 01:27.855
Give me a break.

01:27.958 --> 01:31.878
You think a dance can just
be thrown together Willy-nilly?

01:31.893 --> 01:33.758
You think I decide to just do

01:33.783 --> 01:36.094
a rain forest theme
and buy palm fronds

01:36.117 --> 01:37.504
and rig the sprinkler system
to...

01:37.523 --> 01:38.680
Hold on,
I gotta write this down.

01:39.393 --> 01:41.094
♪ Give me some rope

01:41.111 --> 01:42.812
♪ tie me to dream

01:42.829 --> 01:44.213
♪ give me the hope

01:44.264 --> 01:46.003
♪ to run out of steam

01:46.021 --> 01:49.236
♪ somebody said
it can be here ♪

01:49.425 --> 01:51.159
♪ We could be roped up

01:51.183 --> 01:53.467
♪ tied up, dead in a year ♪

01:53.501 --> 01:58.378
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

01:58.417 --> 02:02.220
♪ One by one,
they all just fade away ♪

02:05.883 --> 02:08.602
So, Britta, you're gonna
throw a protest dance?

02:08.614 --> 02:09.917
Is that a thing?

02:09.940 --> 02:11.000
It is now.

02:11.012 --> 02:13.134
And instead of Sadie Hawkins,

02:13.172 --> 02:15.802
my dance will honor
a real feminist icon,

02:15.840 --> 02:17.480
someone who worked
for women's rights

02:17.494 --> 02:21.640
every day of the year...
Sophie B. Hawkins.

02:21.956 --> 02:23.873
- Oh...
- It wasn't really...

02:24.020 --> 02:26.402
You know what, Britta,
you're right.

02:26.483 --> 02:28.202
A Sophie B. Hawkins dance

02:28.225 --> 02:29.822
is just what
this school needs...

02:29.947 --> 02:30.947
Thanks, Jeff.

02:30.972 --> 02:34.936
To celebrate Sophie B. Hawkins
and all her accomplishments.

02:34.972 --> 02:37.207
Jeez, Winger, who's throwing
this dance, me or you?

02:37.226 --> 02:40.622
Um, Britta, I think you meant
to say Susan B. Anthony,

02:40.641 --> 02:42.170
not Sophie B. Hawkins.

02:42.186 --> 02:43.937
Britta for the whoops!

02:44.141 --> 02:45.842
Didn't you have a cat named
Susan B. Anthony?

02:45.860 --> 02:47.101
How did you manage
to "Britta" that?

02:47.112 --> 02:49.963
I didn't "Britta" anything.
I meant Sophie B. Hawkins.

02:49.974 --> 02:52.759
Really?
Your plan was to throw a dance

02:52.767 --> 02:55.690
honoring the singer of
<i>damn I wish I was your lover?</i>

02:55.739 --> 02:56.687
And <i>as I lay me down,</i>

02:56.712 --> 02:58.719
which in my opinion
is the far superior song.

02:58.742 --> 02:59.980
- Ooh, that is a good song.
- Yeah.

03:00.015 --> 03:01.419
Yes.

03:01.567 --> 03:04.630
I am throwing
a Sophie B. Hawkins dance.

03:05.328 --> 03:07.783
And it is gonna be amazing,

03:07.801 --> 03:10.203
and when people come
they're gonna be like,

03:10.266 --> 03:13.275
"damn! She straight
'Britta'd' this!"

03:13.287 --> 03:16.601
Because, that's right,
I'm taking it back!

03:21.073 --> 03:22.761
You're really doing this?

03:22.831 --> 03:25.006
Look, as someone who faked being
a lawyer for seven years

03:25.030 --> 03:26.702
I appreciate your commitment
to the bit,

03:26.711 --> 03:28.442
but just admit you were wrong.

03:28.461 --> 03:29.629
So you can say I "Britta'd" it?

03:29.658 --> 03:31.656
Yes, of course.
That goes without saying.

03:31.674 --> 03:33.801
But come on,
it was a small mistake.

03:33.807 --> 03:37.063
Call this off before it becomes
a full-scale "Brit-astrophe."

03:37.094 --> 03:38.301
- I coined that.
- Jeff,

03:38.382 --> 03:39.724
if you don't want
to come to my dance

03:39.736 --> 03:41.809
you are free to go
to the Sadie Hawkins dance,

03:41.823 --> 03:45.508
which will be happening at the
same time across the cafeteria.

03:45.698 --> 03:49.062
- Our school has limited venue options.
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

03:49.324 --> 03:51.783
Oh, and one last thing...
You do realize

03:51.813 --> 03:54.061
that if you call it
a Sophie B. Hawkins dance

03:54.087 --> 03:57.918
people will expect Sophie B. Hawkins
to actually be there, right?

03:59.578 --> 04:01.142
Yes.

04:01.372 --> 04:04.137
And when she comes
I'm gonna be like,

04:04.149 --> 04:07.297
<i>"I will remember you</i>
<i>doubting me."</i>

04:07.352 --> 04:09.587
That's a Sarah Mclachlan song.

04:11.328 --> 04:14.547
So, Abed, I was thinking
about what you said,

04:14.576 --> 04:16.555
about showing growth,
and I was thinking

04:16.567 --> 04:19.471
maybe one way to do that is
to meet new people and...

04:19.488 --> 04:21.211
- Where's this going?
- Can I set you up with a date

04:21.216 --> 04:23.245
for the Sadie Hawkins day dance?
- A blind date.

04:23.249 --> 04:25.525
I've always thought of myself
as more of an acquired taste... but...

04:25.574 --> 04:26.356
Okay.

04:26.374 --> 04:27.817
Ooh, if you're open to meeting

04:27.835 --> 04:29.508
someone, there's a number
of eligible young ladies

04:29.522 --> 04:30.951
in my church.
- Shirley!

04:30.984 --> 04:32.941
I'm already finding
a date for Abed.

04:32.971 --> 04:34.448
- I asked first.
- There's no reason we can't

04:34.471 --> 04:36.691
both help Abed find someone.
Why don't we each pick a girl

04:36.703 --> 04:39.450
and then let Abed decide,
instead of making it a competition.

04:39.534 --> 04:40.533
That's exactly a competition.

04:40.551 --> 04:42.459
- So it is.
- Only for the loser.

04:44.803 --> 04:45.816
I need the computer.

04:45.835 --> 04:47.726
Pierce, there are, like,
dozens of computers.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.089
Yeah, but my email is
on this one.

04:49.198 --> 04:51.749
- Pierce!
- Jeez, what's up your butt?

04:51.773 --> 04:54.292
I may have lied this morning
about meeting Sophie B. Hawkins

04:54.317 --> 04:55.987
because I didn't want Jeff
to make fun of me,

04:56.012 --> 04:57.809
and then I may have lied
to cover that lie,

04:57.827 --> 04:59.490
and now I'm in deep...

04:59.633 --> 05:00.633
lies.

05:00.686 --> 05:03.532
So what?
So you told a lie, big deal.

05:03.570 --> 05:06.052
The important thing
is never to admit it.

05:06.128 --> 05:07.922
Actually, I was thinking
about coming clean.

05:07.945 --> 05:09.696
And give Winger
the satisfaction?

05:09.712 --> 05:11.157
Hell, no.

05:11.176 --> 05:13.690
Besides, anything could happen
between now and that dance.

05:13.721 --> 05:15.088
An asteroid could hit.

05:15.153 --> 05:18.691
Do you want to be the schmuck who
apologizes just before the world ends?

05:18.826 --> 05:21.852
That kind of makes sense.
Thank you.

05:21.864 --> 05:22.940
Damn right it makes sense.

05:22.952 --> 05:25.363
You're talking
to the wisest man on campus.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.331
Now seriously,
I need to get to my email.

05:27.349 --> 05:29.082
The post office
is about to close.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.213
Pierce!

05:30.238 --> 05:33.052
Guys, check out my friend Britta's
Sophie B. Hawkins dance.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.949
I'll be spinning the hits
from yesterday and today,

05:34.974 --> 05:37.463
which are basically the same
to me since I have Changnesia.

05:37.514 --> 05:38.465
That guy's like teflon.

05:38.483 --> 05:40.687
No matter how much awful stuff he does,
he keep getting another chance.

05:40.712 --> 05:43.262
Yeah, he's like
the Colin Farrell of people.

05:43.420 --> 05:45.020
You want to help me
with Britta's dance?

05:45.047 --> 05:47.064
Could be a chance for classic
Troy and Abed hijinks.

05:47.095 --> 05:48.898
In the interest of growth
I'm trying to avoid hijinks,

05:48.922 --> 05:50.923
as well as capers, romps,
and exploits.

05:50.958 --> 05:52.650
Escapades are a gray area.

05:52.675 --> 05:55.056
Abed. This is Kat.

05:55.139 --> 05:56.601
Hi, Kat.
Nice to meet you.

05:56.733 --> 05:59.134
She wants to ask you something.

05:59.715 --> 06:01.482
Isn't she perfect for Abed?

06:01.506 --> 06:03.433
She's like one of those quirky
girls from the movies.

06:03.458 --> 06:06.819
I saw her in the cafeteria trying
to pay for lunch with a song.

06:11.177 --> 06:13.006
I asked if you'd go
to the Sadie Hawkins dance

06:13.024 --> 06:14.997
with me into the balloon.

06:15.022 --> 06:16.206
Could you hear it?

06:16.225 --> 06:17.744
Sure, I'd be happy
to go with you.

06:18.006 --> 06:19.903
Super duper mister Cooper!

06:23.875 --> 06:25.013
Nice.

06:25.094 --> 06:27.388
So, you chose the girl
I picked.

06:27.611 --> 06:28.197
It's cool.

06:28.216 --> 06:30.295
Not like it was a competition
or anything.

06:30.826 --> 06:33.820
Just be gentle when you tell
Shirley that she was the loser.

06:33.969 --> 06:35.151
Or do you want me to tell her?

06:35.173 --> 06:37.007
It's cool.
I'll handle it.

06:38.821 --> 06:40.343
So, was that girl an alien

06:40.362 --> 06:42.439
or a toddler with
a growing disease?

06:42.579 --> 06:44.063
Hello, Abed.

06:44.122 --> 06:45.743
I talked to a lovely girl
at my church

06:45.774 --> 06:47.674
and she'd be happy to go
to the dance with you.

06:47.689 --> 06:48.864
I appreciate it, Shirley,
but I...

06:48.888 --> 06:50.236
I hope you will
at least consider it,

06:50.261 --> 06:52.627
and not just because saying "no"
would crush this poor girl,

06:52.664 --> 06:55.792
but because I don't want you to miss out
on the opportunity of a lifetime.

06:56.105 --> 06:57.188
You're right.

06:57.236 --> 06:58.403
I'd love to go to
Britta's dance with her.

06:58.437 --> 07:00.438
Oh, goody!
I'll set it up.

07:00.459 --> 07:03.495
Oh, I hope this doesn't hurt
Annie's feelings.

07:03.529 --> 07:04.763
Maybe I should go tell her.

07:04.810 --> 07:06.100
No need.
I'll handle it.

07:06.125 --> 07:09.142
- Oh, okay.
- Bye-bye.

07:09.669 --> 07:11.688
At the risk of discovering
I'm living two parallel lives

07:11.706 --> 07:12.735
like that guy in <i>Awake,</i>

07:12.770 --> 07:14.202
don't you already have a date
to the dance?

07:14.214 --> 07:15.872
Yep.
Now I have two, which means

07:15.893 --> 07:18.538
I can do the classic two dates
in one night sitcom trope.

07:18.556 --> 07:20.301
I'll get to wear two outfits.
Mix up their names.

07:20.327 --> 07:22.431
- Maybe hide under a table.
- What about growth?

07:22.449 --> 07:23.762
I tried to go in
a more grounded direction,

07:23.781 --> 07:26.366
but I still ended up in a
comically implausible situation.

07:26.615 --> 07:27.614
It's like Shirley said,

07:27.633 --> 07:29.820
it's a once in a lifetime
opportunity for hijinks.

07:29.876 --> 07:30.848
I can't pass it up.

07:30.860 --> 07:33.085
It seems like you already passed up
a great opportunity for hijinks.

07:33.154 --> 07:33.891
I did?

07:33.922 --> 07:35.625
Uh, duh doy!
Britta's dance?

07:35.653 --> 07:37.124
You think two dates is crazy?

07:37.159 --> 07:40.672
Planning a dance is hijinks
city, population hijinks.

07:40.881 --> 07:42.744
Troy, I need your help.

07:42.887 --> 07:44.933
Get some ice?

07:45.257 --> 07:48.626
Wacwacky ice.
The ice will be wacky.

07:55.616 --> 07:57.350
Thank you for the corsage.

07:57.385 --> 08:00.238
Oh, it matches your carnation.
How cute.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.263
Oh, I'm glad you like it.

08:01.286 --> 08:03.035
I was afraid you'd think
it was old-fashioned.

08:03.072 --> 08:06.841
I like old-fashioned.
I find it refreshing.

08:07.162 --> 08:09.430
Speaking of refreshing,
I'm gonna get us some punch.

08:09.484 --> 08:11.635
- Be right back.
- Oh!

08:13.645 --> 08:15.054
Hi, I'm Kevin.

08:15.079 --> 08:17.156
Apparently I'm your DJ tonight.

08:17.180 --> 08:20.168
Uh, I really don't know what
I'm doing, so...

08:20.294 --> 08:22.500
If you have a request,
please be specific.

08:22.530 --> 08:23.863
I have Changnesia.

08:29.010 --> 08:30.108
Can I help you?

08:30.132 --> 08:31.493
Oh, I just wanted to try on
a different look.

08:31.505 --> 08:33.097
I'm pretty indecisive,
so I may be back here

08:33.115 --> 08:34.172
a few times, if that's okay.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.852
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.

08:35.964 --> 08:38.246
I'm also gonna need to check
this Gideon's Bible

08:38.378 --> 08:40.712
and this jelly bean
kaleidoscope.

08:41.123 --> 08:42.765
- Icebreakers.
- Mm.

08:43.297 --> 08:45.171
Hey, Britta.
Where's Sophie B.?

08:45.202 --> 08:48.116
Is she backstage drinking Zima
and counting her beanie babies?

08:48.129 --> 08:49.761
Sorry, I can't divulge that.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.181
Stars and their privacy,
you know.

08:51.194 --> 08:53.156
But she'll definitely be here?

08:53.182 --> 08:54.936
Oh, yeah.
Sophie be coming.

08:54.961 --> 08:57.520
So it just be coincidence
that somebody posted

08:57.545 --> 08:59.300
a craigslist ad an hour ago

08:59.319 --> 09:02.034
that says, "looking for
Sophie B. Hawkins,

09:02.049 --> 09:04.501
"or convincing
Sophie B. Hawkins impersonator

09:04.522 --> 09:07.220
to play community college
dance tonight.

09:07.251 --> 09:08.669
Very little money."

09:08.784 --> 09:10.956
It's weird
how in demand she is.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.162
Good thing we booked her early.

09:13.810 --> 09:15.862
Britta, we're running low
on chips.

09:15.881 --> 09:16.712
Here's what I'm thinking.

09:16.737 --> 09:18.264
I go over
to the Sadie Hawkins dance

09:18.283 --> 09:20.186
as the snack inspector,
doing random spot checks,

09:20.204 --> 09:21.536
and confiscate their chips.

09:21.577 --> 09:23.559
All I need is a disguise.

09:23.571 --> 09:25.793
Or you could just go
to the supply closet

09:25.818 --> 09:26.833
and get some more chips.

09:26.852 --> 09:29.912
Okay, but I-I still need
to use the moustache probably.

09:33.664 --> 09:35.048
Here, in lieu of flowers

09:35.082 --> 09:37.067
I got you this.
It's quirky.

09:37.101 --> 09:38.318
Thanks, guv'nor!

09:38.352 --> 09:41.254
I'll just put it
in me invisible sack.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.578
Okay, I'm gonna get us
some punch.

09:48.437 --> 09:49.375
Hey!

09:49.403 --> 09:51.135
How are things going with you
and Jessica?

09:51.153 --> 09:53.687
Are you two-- as they say on TV--
making a connection?

09:53.723 --> 09:56.345
Unless that means sex, in which
case I hope you are not.

09:56.399 --> 09:57.345
Things are great.

09:57.370 --> 09:59.254
Actually, Jessica did mention
that she's cold.

09:59.272 --> 10:00.407
- Could she borrow your sweater?
- Oh.

10:00.431 --> 10:02.309
Maybe the purple one you wore last week.
I didn't see you wear it home,

10:02.334 --> 10:03.756
so I think it's still in your locker
next to your umbrella.

10:03.775 --> 10:05.781
- I guess I could check.
- Could you?

10:05.813 --> 10:08.394
- That'd be great.
- Okay.

10:09.767 --> 10:10.730
Hey, roomie.

10:10.768 --> 10:11.805
What do you think of Kat?

10:11.811 --> 10:13.716
Did she tell you she plays
the saw?

10:13.759 --> 10:15.490
I thought she was
in an all-girl kazoo band?

10:15.509 --> 10:17.543
They need a rhythm section,
duh.

10:17.620 --> 10:20.078
Well, keep me posted.
I'm gonna go say hi to Britta.

10:20.122 --> 10:21.347
No, don't!

10:21.585 --> 10:22.978
Because you have something
in your teeth.

10:23.009 --> 10:23.873
A lot of somethings.

10:23.916 --> 10:25.482
I do?
What is it?

10:25.501 --> 10:27.482
Ooh, I can't tell in this light.
But it's definitely there.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.864
You should probably check it out
in the bathroom.

10:28.883 --> 10:30.217
Maybe the second floor one?
Better light.

10:30.229 --> 10:31.900
I will.
Thank you.

10:31.928 --> 10:33.879
You're a good friend.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.074

10:42.668 --> 10:44.301
Hello, Jeffrey.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.494
Are you enjoying the sock hop?

10:46.513 --> 10:49.024
A sock hop Britta has
all but "Britta'd"

10:49.164 --> 10:50.865
by not "Britta-ing"
her own dance.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.430
Well, the night is young.

10:52.454 --> 10:53.324
- Mm.
- By the way,

10:53.352 --> 10:55.078
I'm surprised you let her share
the cafeteria with you.

10:55.091 --> 10:57.272
Oh, I didn't want to.
But once she guaranteed

10:57.291 --> 10:59.468
the presence of a certain
someone, I couldn't say no.

11:00.544 --> 11:02.775
I wouldn't get your hopes
up for Sophie B...

11:02.909 --> 11:05.544
- Oh, it's me.
- Shall we dance? Whoop.

11:07.618 --> 11:09.441
- Are you reading the Bible?
- No spoilers.

11:09.466 --> 11:12.246
I'm really hoping that things
turn around for this job guy.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.502
So, how do I look?

11:14.577 --> 11:16.478
Good.
Except you gotta lose the hat.

11:16.496 --> 11:18.512
It doesn't go with
the minister's daughter.

11:22.234 --> 11:23.210
You know what I'm doing.

11:23.235 --> 11:25.176
Yeah.
You're on two dates at once.

11:25.212 --> 11:26.812
I've been watching you
since you came in.

11:26.830 --> 11:28.416
I'm not good with faces.
Is that a judgmental face

11:28.434 --> 11:30.615
or a happy face?
- I think it's awesome.

11:30.631 --> 11:33.664
It's one of my favorite bits,
like when a dog acts embarrassed,

11:33.684 --> 11:35.142
or when a guy
chases after the girl

11:35.153 --> 11:37.246
and then does that big public
declaration of love.

11:37.270 --> 11:39.871
It's not realistic. It's taking something
private and turning it into a performance.

11:39.883 --> 11:41.009
Well, I think
the dog's trained.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.352
No, I was talking about
the public declaration of love...

11:43.845 --> 11:46.621
- Oh, you're messing with me.
- Yes, I was.

11:46.826 --> 11:49.707
So this thing's turning out to be a little
tougher than I thought. You wanna help?

11:49.719 --> 11:51.396
I'd like to,
but I've still got like

11:51.418 --> 11:53.520
1,200 pages left of this Bible.
Yes, of course I would.

11:53.554 --> 11:55.115
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

11:55.284 --> 11:56.598
Tonight's Sadie Hawkins dance

11:56.623 --> 11:59.211
is brought to you
by Hawthorne Wipes.

11:59.256 --> 12:01.691
For the little lady who knows
her place in the kitchen.

12:01.731 --> 12:04.099
And tonight's
Sophie B. Hawkins dance

12:04.126 --> 12:06.828
is brought to you
by Hawthorne Wipes.

12:06.849 --> 12:09.856
Perfect for cleaning the
dashboard of your '92 Subaru.

12:11.315 --> 12:14.703
Ah, quite a turnout, Britta.

12:14.770 --> 12:18.042
Yep. Didn't know Sophie B.
Hawkins was so big at Greendale.

12:18.066 --> 12:20.892
Oh, yeah.
A large percentage of Greendale

12:20.910 --> 12:23.420
students sort of gave up
in the mid '90s,

12:23.450 --> 12:24.683
so for many of them

12:24.708 --> 12:27.441
Sophie B. Hawkins is the most
recent music they're aware of.

12:27.478 --> 12:31.229
I mean, her coming here is gonna
be a huge boost to their spirits.

12:31.266 --> 12:32.148
Great.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.921
Whereas, her not showing up

12:34.992 --> 12:37.520
would be enough
to push these people

12:37.544 --> 12:39.279
to such a dark place
and really question

12:39.298 --> 12:42.904
whether life is worth living
at all.

12:43.418 --> 12:45.733
Okay, bye-bye.

12:46.385 --> 12:49.257
So, how long have you been
doing Bible studies?

12:49.667 --> 12:51.332
I mean, making miniature hats
out of duct tape?

12:51.357 --> 12:53.924
- Oh, duct tape hat...
- Oh!

12:56.374 --> 12:57.062
Ah!

12:57.081 --> 12:58.803
So you've never seen any
of the <i>Star Wars</i> movies?

12:58.827 --> 13:00.671
We were taught popular films
were the work of the devil.

13:00.690 --> 13:02.202
Well, if you're talking about
<i>the Phantom Menace,</i>

13:02.218 --> 13:03.792
you were taught right.

13:03.902 --> 13:06.890
- Telegram.
- Ooh, yeah, it's urgent.

13:06.928 --> 13:08.415
Be right back.

13:09.813 --> 13:12.192
Pierce, Sophie B. Hawkins
isn't coming.

13:12.211 --> 13:13.584
Everyone's gonna know
I'm a liar.

13:13.609 --> 13:15.803
- Help me.
- Oh, Britta.

13:15.819 --> 13:17.571
Let me tell you a story about
a friend of mine

13:17.589 --> 13:19.243
that everyone called a liar.

13:19.292 --> 13:20.792
His name was Bernie Madoff.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.426
Pierce!
He was a liar.

13:22.450 --> 13:25.123
He stole billions of dollars
from his clients.

13:25.433 --> 13:27.818
Has this been confirmed?

13:27.993 --> 13:31.034
Oh, my God.
I "Britta'd" it.

13:33.176 --> 13:34.775
Bernie?

13:35.572 --> 13:38.625
- Oh, hi, Shirley.
- Hello, Annie.

13:38.721 --> 13:42.040
Abed seems to be having a good
time, which is all that matters.

13:42.105 --> 13:43.289
You're right.

13:43.310 --> 13:44.911
Looks like he made
the right choice.

13:44.935 --> 13:46.667
He certainly did.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.018
So, we agree.
The best woman won.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.468
She certainly did.

13:52.176 --> 13:53.626
He's on two dates, isn't he?

13:53.792 --> 13:55.910
He certainly is.

13:56.671 --> 13:59.452
This is the most fun I've ever
had on a work study gig.

13:59.465 --> 14:01.017
And I used to run
the frozen yogurt machine

14:01.029 --> 14:02.466
before that old guy broke it.

14:02.499 --> 14:03.519
There's been
so many close calls.

14:03.531 --> 14:05.325
I keep forgetting details,
using the wrong names,

14:05.345 --> 14:07.617
- having to duck behind plants.
- Aah!

14:07.660 --> 14:08.891
This night has been perfect.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.517
Oh, what else is on the list?

14:10.717 --> 14:12.935
- Oh!
- Sorry.

14:17.255 --> 14:21.324
If this were a movie, this would
be the part where we kiss.

14:22.065 --> 14:23.049
You're right.

14:23.403 --> 14:25.903
Except we're doing a sitcom trope,
so it'd be totally out of place.

14:25.956 --> 14:28.476
Time to go get caught and make an
impassioned plea to the girl I really like.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.535
I think I'm gonna
go with Jessica.

14:29.553 --> 14:30.829
She seems to be
the audience favorite.

14:30.879 --> 14:32.733
Okay, bye.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.499
Uh-oh.

14:40.511 --> 14:42.263
Did you really think
you'd get away with this?

14:42.275 --> 14:44.247
- Let me explain.
- What about wanting to grow?

14:44.272 --> 14:48.250
Or was that just a lie so you could do
another world-famous Abed TV adventure?

14:48.269 --> 14:49.792
These are real people
you're messing with.

14:49.811 --> 14:52.308
Kat is over there hula-hooping
all by herself.

14:52.346 --> 14:56.052
Abed, in the real world people
can actually get hurt.

14:58.403 --> 15:02.845
Oh, this is great.
So, I got a request for,

15:02.863 --> 15:05.370
"You suck at this.
Get off the stage."

15:05.396 --> 15:07.530
Okay, I don't know if that's
the band or the song.

15:07.651 --> 15:11.076
Again, apologies.
Changnesia.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.056
Well, it blew up in my face,

15:13.081 --> 15:15.467
in a slightly different way than
I planned.

15:16.005 --> 15:18.435
- Can I help you?
- Where's Rachel?

15:18.453 --> 15:20.344
- She said she had to go.
- Where?

15:20.378 --> 15:21.896
I don't know.
She seemed upset.

15:21.908 --> 15:23.599
She ran out of here without
tagging half this stuff.

15:23.617 --> 15:25.382
I mean, whose water wings
are these?

15:26.667 --> 15:27.931
Come back here!

15:27.994 --> 15:29.912
Never mind.

15:40.716 --> 15:41.717
Sorry.

15:41.748 --> 15:43.103
I did mean what
I said about growth.

15:43.134 --> 15:46.143
But then you were both so intent on
getting me dates, I couldn't help myself.

15:46.168 --> 15:47.813
It was wrong, and hurtful.

15:47.850 --> 15:48.951
I see that now.

15:49.005 --> 15:51.874
Well, maybe setting you up
was a bad idea.

15:52.002 --> 15:54.837
Yeah, I guess neither of our
girls were really right for you.

15:54.859 --> 15:57.515
The worst part is that I met
a girl tonight that I really do like.

15:57.647 --> 16:00.266
But I was so busy chasing one trope,
I missed the trope right under my nose...

16:00.295 --> 16:02.714
That the girl I liked all along
was under my nose.

16:02.847 --> 16:05.006
And now I've screwed things up.
I don't know if I can make them right.

16:05.043 --> 16:05.800
Aww.

16:05.818 --> 16:07.788
Wait.
This one's real, right?

16:07.812 --> 16:08.629
Yeah, I'm really sad.

16:08.653 --> 16:09.892
Aww.

16:10.015 --> 16:11.822
Well, go find her, dummy.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.967
Yeah, haven't you ever seen
a movie?

16:14.839 --> 16:18.278
Sophie! Sophie! Sophie!

16:18.306 --> 16:20.469
Sophie. Sophie. Sophie.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.582
I hate to say I told you so,

16:22.627 --> 16:24.468
but I'm gonna say it
to Britta's face.

16:24.510 --> 16:27.181
Sophie! Sophie! Sophie!

16:27.193 --> 16:28.904
What is the nature of hope?

16:28.935 --> 16:30.856
Sophie's not coming, guys.

16:33.390 --> 16:35.135
Boo! Boo!

16:35.147 --> 16:36.882
Looks like someone
underestimated

16:36.901 --> 16:38.667
the time it takes
to plan a dance.

16:40.519 --> 16:42.536
Hey, hey, hey!
It's Sophie B. Hawkins!

16:53.055 --> 16:56.373
Good evening!
I'm Sophie B. Hawkins.

16:56.590 --> 16:57.941

There was a girl here tonight.
Her name was Rachel.

17:49.963 --> 17:51.564
I met her,
and it was very pleasant.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.155
And I made a mistake.

17:56.155 --> 17:58.724
And now I'd very much like to continue
this conversation in private.

17:59.010 --> 18:01.272
Wow, viva lost love.

18:03.945 --> 18:05.705
♪ Damn

18:05.730 --> 18:08.263
♪ I wish I was your lover

18:08.293 --> 18:10.410
♪ I'd rock you till
the daylight comes... ♪

18:10.441 --> 18:13.501
- You came back.
- That was pretty embarrassing.

18:13.532 --> 18:15.467
- I had to...
- Hmm.

18:15.510 --> 18:17.939
It was.
But I'm glad I did it.

18:17.957 --> 18:20.242
So, would you like
to go out sometime?

18:20.260 --> 18:21.380
I would like that.

18:21.428 --> 18:23.737
Do you want to pretend like you're
just going out with me on a bet?

18:23.762 --> 18:25.400
- Oh, I'd like that very much.
- Mm-hmm.

18:25.424 --> 18:26.956
But maybe we should try
normal first.

18:26.994 --> 18:29.916
- Sure.
- Oh!

18:31.597 --> 18:34.448
- I prefer <i>As I Lay Me Down.</i>
<i>- Me too.</i>

18:36.824 --> 18:38.458
I can't believe
she pulled this off.

18:38.476 --> 18:39.576
I know.

18:39.610 --> 18:42.238
According to dean law,
I must now give her my amulet.

18:42.660 --> 18:44.530
- What?
- Hmm?

18:45.039 --> 18:48.391
Well, she had a little help
from a wise old man

18:48.423 --> 18:50.579
who was the official supplier
of moist towelettes

18:50.603 --> 18:53.871
to the lilith fair between
1997 and 1999.

18:53.902 --> 18:55.872
I knew it.
You're safe.

18:57.864 --> 18:59.567
You did this?
But why?

18:59.584 --> 19:02.288
Because, in the face
of all logic and reason,

19:02.348 --> 19:05.200
Britta didn't back down.
That makes no sense.

19:05.234 --> 19:07.539
Also, I didn't like the way you
were being such a jerk to her.

19:07.570 --> 19:08.561
Well, she was acting crazy.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.257
Yeah, but what choice
did she have?

19:10.275 --> 19:13.571
You make fun of her, you use her
name as a synonym for screwing up.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.489
Cut her some slack, Jeff.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.956
She helped you reconcile
with your dad.

19:17.993 --> 19:20.594
For Pete's sake,
let her be happy.

19:24.115 --> 19:29.037
