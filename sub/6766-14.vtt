WEBVTT

00:06.105 --> 00:08.369
Hey!

00:08.407 --> 00:09.374
Look, it fits.

00:09.408 --> 00:11.069
It's cute.

00:11.110 --> 00:13.635
How come you have
to fill in for Lisa?

00:13.679 --> 00:15.044
Doesn't she have
any other friends?

00:15.081 --> 00:17.208
Hey, she's on Rose Queen
business tomorrow.

00:17.250 --> 00:20.048
Besides, us women of the
Royal Court, we stick together.

00:20.086 --> 00:22.145
I'm gonna drive you down there
tomorrow morning, okay?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.815
No, you don't have to do that.

00:23.856 --> 00:26.347
Since we lost our shot
at the Rose Bowl last week,

00:26.392 --> 00:28.383
I don't really have
anything better to do.

00:28.427 --> 00:30.361
Well, you'll have
another chance next year.

00:30.396 --> 00:31.988
You sound like Coach.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.396
Mm.

00:33.432 --> 00:36.196
How about me coming down there
and hanging out with you

00:36.235 --> 00:37.702
at the store till you're done.

00:37.737 --> 00:39.261
All day? No way.

00:39.305 --> 00:42.069
Donna, it's not exactly
the safest area.

00:42.108 --> 00:44.042
It's safe enough for Lisa.

00:44.076 --> 00:47.876
Yeah, well, she's... local.

00:47.914 --> 00:49.347
What do you mean?

00:49.382 --> 00:51.873
It's okay for her to work there
'cause she's black?

00:51.918 --> 00:55.046
No, it...

00:55.087 --> 00:56.714
I'm just looking out for you.

00:56.756 --> 00:58.485
I know.

00:58.524 --> 01:00.458
And I love you for it,
but don't worry about me.

01:00.493 --> 01:01.755
I'll be fine.

01:02.795 --> 01:04.729
Okay.

01:04.763 --> 01:06.823
Okay.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.706 --> 02:55.298
Yeah, right over there.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.933
Thanks.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.069
Well, it looks like
everything's come together.

02:59.111 --> 03:00.874
Uh-huh.

03:00.913 --> 03:02.642
That's all you have to say?

03:02.682 --> 03:04.047
Uh-huh.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.573
Well, how about,
"Thank you, Valerie,

03:05.618 --> 03:07.449
"for letting Alpha House
use the After Dark

03:07.553 --> 03:08.577
for Charity Casino Night"?

03:08.621 --> 03:10.350
Thank you, Valerie.

03:10.389 --> 03:12.254
You know, that's what I
like about you, Kelly.

03:12.291 --> 03:14.225
You're so polite.

03:17.563 --> 03:19.394
Ooh, big spender.

03:19.432 --> 03:23.926
King, ten, seven...

03:23.969 --> 03:26.437
- Blackjack!
- Ah! Blackjack!

03:26.472 --> 03:28.372
- I knew it.
- Not bad. I'll stand on 20.

03:28.407 --> 03:30.238
All right, dealer has... 17.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.870
Sanders, why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

03:32.912 --> 03:34.846
Don't you have to work tomorrow?

03:34.880 --> 03:36.711
Well, it's not like
they're paying me.

03:36.749 --> 03:39.115
No, a lot of people would pay
them to get an internship

03:39.151 --> 03:41.312
at a major talent agency.
Deal.

03:41.353 --> 03:42.479
Actually, I think

03:42.588 --> 03:44.112
that's how my father
got me this job.

03:44.156 --> 03:46.317
You wouldn't believe the woman
they assigned me to work with.

03:46.358 --> 03:48.349
What she lacks in talent
and personality,

03:48.394 --> 03:50.123
she certainly makes up
for in looks.

03:51.163 --> 03:52.460
You want to make a play here,
junior?

03:52.498 --> 03:54.090
- Hit me. - Hey, guys.
- Hey. - Hey, Susan.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.225
Place looks great.

03:55.267 --> 03:57.167
Looks like a real casino.

03:57.203 --> 04:00.036
Not like I've ever been
to a real casino.

04:00.072 --> 04:01.835
- You've never been to Vegas?
- No.

04:01.874 --> 04:03.034
But I tell you what.

04:03.075 --> 04:04.406
I cannot wait to get my hands
on those dice.

04:04.443 --> 04:05.535
How do you play that game
anyway?

04:05.578 --> 04:08.172
Stick with me, kiddo.
I'm the master.

04:08.214 --> 04:09.408
I'm sure you are.

04:09.448 --> 04:11.211
Oh, be warned.

04:13.919 --> 04:15.784
Hey, Nat, check out
that setup next door?

04:15.821 --> 04:17.015
Yeah. It looks great,
doesn't it?

04:17.055 --> 04:19.081
Looks like it's gonna be
a lot of fun.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.820
So, uh, you're gonna play?

04:20.860 --> 04:22.157
Of course.

04:22.194 --> 04:23.923
You think that's such
a good idea?

04:23.963 --> 04:26.932
Nat,
it's strictly recreational.

04:26.966 --> 04:28.126
Besides, I learned my lesson.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.691
You don't see me laying any bets

04:29.735 --> 04:31.362
on football games
this year, do you?

04:31.403 --> 04:32.461
No.

04:32.505 --> 04:33.836
Well, then relax.

04:33.873 --> 04:36.842
Believe me, I don't want to go
through that again.

04:36.876 --> 04:38.241
Hey, where's my money?

04:38.277 --> 04:41.178
I said I'd let you slide
one time and one time only.

04:41.213 --> 04:43.408
And I paid you every cent.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.473
That was the last time.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.508
Where's the money
you owe me, now?

04:48.354 --> 04:49.844
I'll-I'll get it.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.948
I just need a few days, Duke.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.926
I like you, I do,

04:54.960 --> 04:59.420
but this guy in my car,
that's Tony.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.593
And Tony...
he doesn't like anybody.

05:04.403 --> 05:07.429
Okay, Brandon,
you're a big boy now.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.100
I guess you know
what you're doing.

05:09.141 --> 05:10.836
I guess I do.

05:17.716 --> 05:20.276
What're you doing?

05:20.319 --> 05:21.980
Oh, avoiding work.

05:22.021 --> 05:25.286
Good. We can avoid it together.

05:25.324 --> 05:26.416
Whatcha got there?

05:26.458 --> 05:28.449
It's a portrait of you.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.461
Let me see this.

05:30.529 --> 05:31.461
What do you think?

05:31.497 --> 05:34.466
Not bad.
What about the hair?

05:34.533 --> 05:35.795
Oh, I forgot the hair.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.700
Get the hair.

05:37.736 --> 05:39.226
And the brows.

05:39.271 --> 05:42.468
Don't forget the brows.

05:42.541 --> 05:44.133
- Oh...
- Much better.

05:44.176 --> 05:45.575
How much do you think
we'd get for it

05:45.611 --> 05:46.703
at the charity auction?

05:46.745 --> 05:47.769
There's a sucker born
every minute.

05:47.813 --> 05:49.474
Thank you for your donation.

05:49.582 --> 05:52.278
Anything I can do for the cause.

05:52.318 --> 05:54.115
What is the cause?

05:54.153 --> 05:57.782
Kid Kare day care centers
all over the Southland.

05:57.823 --> 06:00.155
You actually think
anyone's gonna bid

06:00.192 --> 06:01.750
on a portrait-sitting with me?

06:01.794 --> 06:04.285
I intend to make sure of that.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.705
ITM. Tammy Kane's office.

06:19.745 --> 06:22.270
Yes, she's right here.
Please hold.

06:22.314 --> 06:23.440
I told you.

06:23.482 --> 06:24.608
I have scripts to read.

06:24.650 --> 06:25.912
Take a message.
I'm unavailable.

06:27.786 --> 06:30.778
I'm sorry, she's unavailable
to come to the phone right now.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.222
Can she call you back?

06:32.258 --> 06:33.725
Thank you.

06:33.759 --> 06:36.091
Steve, I don't have time

06:36.128 --> 06:38.961
to juggle clients
and a hard-to-train intern.

06:38.998 --> 06:41.432
I'm sorry. I just thought
you might be interested

06:41.467 --> 06:42.957
in taking a call
from Jonathan Erwich,

06:43.002 --> 06:45.300
the new head of development
at Paramount.

06:45.337 --> 06:47.396
Erwich? Since when?

06:47.439 --> 06:50.101
Since this morning.

06:50.142 --> 06:51.541
Front page.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.744
Should I get him
back on the phone?

06:56.782 --> 06:58.272
No, I'll do it myself.

06:58.317 --> 07:00.376
Just do what I asked
you to do, and...

07:00.419 --> 07:03.752
oh, and when you open my mail,
be sure to open them neatly.

07:03.789 --> 07:06.019
I don't like my envelopes
shredded.

07:06.058 --> 07:07.184
Got it.

07:07.226 --> 07:08.420
What about your personal mail?

07:08.460 --> 07:09.484
There's nothing personal.

07:12.331 --> 07:13.423
Stevie!

07:13.499 --> 07:14.864
Hey, Scott. Hi.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.425
I am so glad we got you aboard.

07:17.503 --> 07:18.800
Me, too.

07:18.837 --> 07:20.702
Your dad and I walked 18 holes
at Bel Air last week,

07:20.739 --> 07:22.832
and all he could do was twist
my arm about hiring you.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.604
I think he even let me win.

07:24.643 --> 07:26.941
Well, I hope I can live up
to the advance billing.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.446
- Oh, you'll do fine.
- I hope to.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.072
And call my office.
We should have lunch.

07:30.115 --> 07:31.742
I will.
See you later.

07:31.784 --> 07:32.842
Mr. Coveny?

07:32.885 --> 07:34.250
Yes?

07:34.286 --> 07:36.254
I was wondering
if I could put in

07:36.288 --> 07:38.654
to have Steve permanently
assigned to me?

07:38.691 --> 07:41.751
He's... terrific.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.694
Sure.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.697
You can have him
for as long as you like.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.358
- Thank you.
- Mm.

07:50.169 --> 07:53.627
Steve, why don't you get
Jonathan Erwich on the phone?

07:53.672 --> 07:55.537
Right away.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.773
You need to borrow some
money again this week?

08:06.652 --> 08:08.586
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thanks.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.178
Um...

08:10.222 --> 08:12.588
Hi. Um, how much is this?

08:12.624 --> 08:15.957
Hmm, you don't strike me
as the teddy bear type.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.223
Nah, it's not for me.

08:17.262 --> 08:18.320
It's for my little brother's
birthday.

08:18.364 --> 08:21.060
Oh. Here, let me see.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.260
Oh, here we go.

08:22.301 --> 08:23.427
Uh, $4.99 plus tax.

08:23.502 --> 08:24.628
Not bad. Pretty cute.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.262
Five bucks?

08:26.305 --> 08:27.397
Forget it.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.888
Hey, you, stop right there!
Got you this time, huh?

08:49.928 --> 08:51.225
Let go of me!

08:51.263 --> 08:53.094
Leave me alone!
Let go of me!

08:53.132 --> 08:54.861
No, no, no.
Okay what is this?

08:54.900 --> 08:55.867
Hey, Stan,

08:55.901 --> 08:56.925
he didn't steal it.

08:56.969 --> 08:58.197
What?

08:58.237 --> 08:59.966
He just paid me for it.

09:01.974 --> 09:05.102
Yeah, that's right,
I paid $4.99 plus tax.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.873
So who's rippin'
who off here, chump?

09:06.912 --> 09:08.641
So, why you hiding it
under your shirt, huh?

09:11.417 --> 09:14.545
So the gangstas down the street
won't take it from me, okay?

09:19.558 --> 09:21.150
He's just a kid, Stan.

09:21.193 --> 09:23.684
He's trouble is what he is.

10:06.004 --> 10:08.097
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.129
You ready to go?

10:09.174 --> 10:10.232
Yes.

10:12.744 --> 10:15.042
Let's go.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.105
Bye, Stan.

10:17.149 --> 10:19.811
Ah, thanks for coming out
to help us today, Donna.

10:19.852 --> 10:21.979
If you ever need a job,
give me a call.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.112
I'll remember that.
Thank you.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.281
Okay, take care.

10:24.323 --> 10:25.381
See you later.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.255
Hi.

10:27.292 --> 10:28.259
Hey.

10:28.293 --> 10:29.419
Look, um,

10:29.461 --> 10:32.089
I'm sorry
about what happened before.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.962
Thanks for saving my butt.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.499
My name's Isaiah.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.797
I'm Donna.
This is Joe.

10:38.837 --> 10:40.202
- Hey.
- How you doin'?

10:40.239 --> 10:45.472
Look, um, I've only got,
uh, three dollars.

10:45.511 --> 10:47.342
That's okay.
You keep it.

10:47.379 --> 10:51.645
You know, I never would steal
anything...

10:51.683 --> 10:54.777
except it's for my little
brother's birthday.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.788
I know. You told me.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.983
- Come on, Donna. We gotta go.
- Okay.

11:00.692 --> 11:03.752
Hey, really. I'm not a thief.

11:03.795 --> 11:06.389
Well, from now on, make sure
you can pay for something

11:06.431 --> 11:07.898
before you leave
the store with it.

11:17.509 --> 11:19.909
Cool.

11:22.114 --> 11:24.105
Thank you.

11:24.149 --> 11:26.083
Last pick up.

11:26.118 --> 11:27.142
Got anything?

11:27.186 --> 11:28.778
Nope.

11:28.820 --> 11:31.482
You planning to go to that big
thing at the After Dark tonight?

11:31.590 --> 11:34.024
I'm running that big thing
at the After Dark tonight.

11:34.059 --> 11:35.356
You a KEG man?

11:35.394 --> 11:37.487
Yes, I am.
And you?

11:37.563 --> 11:39.463
- Nope. I'm a Delta.
- Ah, Delta.

11:39.498 --> 11:41.090
Well, I won't hold it
against you.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.998
Oh... Thanks.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.936
See ya.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.337
Hmm, personal and confidential.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.839
Neatly not shredded.

11:58.116 --> 12:01.142
Oh, God, she got canned.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.475
Mail come?

12:27.579 --> 12:29.479
Yeah, I haven't had time
to open it, though.

12:45.063 --> 12:46.189
Come in.

12:47.699 --> 12:49.462
Hi, um, it's 4:30.

12:49.501 --> 12:50.763
I need to head out.

12:50.802 --> 12:52.827
Remember that benefit
I needed to leave early for?

12:52.871 --> 12:54.736
Oh, uh, right.

12:54.773 --> 12:56.263
Kid Kare, right?
There's no problem.

12:56.308 --> 12:57.969
Anything else I can
do before I leave?

12:58.010 --> 12:59.705
No. Thanks.

13:01.079 --> 13:02.444
I'll see you on Monday.

13:02.481 --> 13:04.108
Okay.

13:41.753 --> 13:43.618
Joe, haven't we already
been by that corner?

13:43.655 --> 13:45.179
I think we're going in circles.

13:45.223 --> 13:47.987
I'm sorry. I've never been
to this part of town, okay?

13:48.026 --> 13:50.153
So why don't you
ask for directions?

13:50.195 --> 13:51.492
Why don't guys do that?

13:51.563 --> 13:53.053
We've got bigger problems.

13:53.098 --> 13:56.295
I knew I should have got gas
before I left the Westside.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.962
Joe...

13:58.003 --> 13:59.766
Hey, I didn't plan
on getting lost.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.374
Damn.

14:03.408 --> 14:05.899
We're out of gas?

14:05.944 --> 14:07.070
Yeah.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.909
Oh, great, what are
we going to do now?

14:08.947 --> 14:11.677
I don't know.

14:11.717 --> 14:14.811
Find a phone or a gas station.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.684
Whichever comes first.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.704
One...

14:34.740 --> 14:38.870
plus one... two.

14:38.910 --> 14:41.470
Minus one is one.

14:41.546 --> 14:44.709
Plus one is two.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.479
- Hey.
- Zero...

14:46.585 --> 14:47.813
What are you doing?

14:47.853 --> 14:50.219
Counting cards...
Clare taught me how.

14:50.255 --> 14:51.722
Isn't that cheating?

14:51.757 --> 14:55.056
Only if you know what
you're doing, which I don't.

14:55.093 --> 14:58.324
Oh, there's a e-mail on the
counter from Jim and Cindy.

14:58.363 --> 15:01.332
They're not coming
home for Christmas.

15:01.366 --> 15:02.993
I'm sorry.

15:03.034 --> 15:04.934
I know you were
looking forward to that.

15:04.970 --> 15:09.031
Yeah, I miss those guys.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.440
Guess I'll have to drown my
sorrows at the blackjack table.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.569
Taking this a little
seriously, aren't you?

15:13.612 --> 15:16.547
Just lowering the
house odds a little.

15:16.581 --> 15:18.276
The house is for charity,
Brandon.

15:18.316 --> 15:19.681
The idea is to lose.

15:19.718 --> 15:22.687
Which is exactly what
I'm gonna be doing

15:22.721 --> 15:24.348
if you don't stop
distracting me.

15:24.389 --> 15:26.789
- Now get out of here.
- Well, excuse me for breathing.

15:29.361 --> 15:32.023
Zero...

15:32.063 --> 15:33.724
Just relax.

15:33.765 --> 15:35.096
Act like you own the place.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.327
Everything's gonna be fine.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.632
I don't own the place,
and I am relaxed.

15:38.670 --> 15:40.399
I think you better relax.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.430
Check this out.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.985
Hey, y'all looking
for Rodeo Drive?

15:59.024 --> 16:00.889
No, we're looking
for a gas station.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.791
Hop on in.
We'll give you a ride.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.921
- No, thanks.
- Hey, nobody talking to you.

16:04.963 --> 16:08.023
Hey, now, is that your truck up
on the road, there, blondie?

16:09.501 --> 16:10.866
Well, we'll take care of it
for you.

16:10.902 --> 16:13.200
Hey, Donna! Joe!

16:14.239 --> 16:16.070
You guys finally made it.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.304
I've been waitin' on dinner.

16:18.343 --> 16:21.244
Yeah, we ran out of gas.

16:21.279 --> 16:24.680
Joe, what's wrong
with you, man?

16:24.716 --> 16:26.081
Well, um,

16:26.117 --> 16:28.585
you can come up to my house,
grab a bite to eat

16:28.620 --> 16:30.850
and then my mama gonna take
you guys to go get some gas.

16:30.889 --> 16:31.947
Thanks, guys.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.515
Too bad we couldn't be
of any help.

16:36.194 --> 16:38.162
Good thinking, kid.

16:38.196 --> 16:41.563
Yeah, well, my mama
didn't raise no dummy.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.033
You actually ran out of gas?

16:43.068 --> 16:44.160
Yeah.

16:44.202 --> 16:45.863
Don't say anything
about my mama.

16:47.806 --> 16:50.604
Well, here we are.

16:50.642 --> 16:53.338
Tonya, what did I tell you?

16:53.378 --> 16:55.175
- Hi. - I told you to lay off
the peanut butter.

16:55.213 --> 16:57.272
You're gonna spoil your dinner.

16:57.315 --> 16:58.748
Look, go put it up.

17:01.453 --> 17:02.511
Phone's over there.

17:02.554 --> 17:04.146
Oh, thanks.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.080
So where's your mom?

17:07.125 --> 17:08.922
She's at work.
She'll be home later.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.655
Yeah? How about your dad?

17:10.694 --> 17:13.357
- Hello, Auto Club?
- I don't have a dad.

17:13.397 --> 17:15.025
I need to go to the bathroom.

17:15.066 --> 17:16.431
I need to go to the bathroom.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.867
Benjamin, go to the
bathroom by yourself.

17:18.904 --> 17:22.271
Big boys can always go to
the bathroom by themselves.

17:22.307 --> 17:25.435
Tonya!

17:25.477 --> 17:26.910
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:26.944 --> 17:28.173
I didn't mean to.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.441
What is wrong with you, girl?

17:29.481 --> 17:30.880
I'll clean it up.
I'm sorry.

17:30.916 --> 17:31.974
Look, look, just don't move.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.382
You don't have any shoes on.

17:33.418 --> 17:34.646
Where's the broom?

17:34.686 --> 17:36.381
- It's behind the door.
- You get her shoes on.

17:36.421 --> 17:37.820
I'll sweep it up.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.380
All right.

17:39.424 --> 17:41.051
I just talked to the Auto Club.

17:41.092 --> 17:42.855
They're going to be here
within a half an hour.

17:42.894 --> 17:44.191
Mm, good.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.628
What happened?

17:45.664 --> 17:47.097
Just kids being kids.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.828
You know, I don't think
we should leave them alone.

17:49.868 --> 17:51.597
Where are their parents?

17:51.636 --> 17:53.797
Hah. Grab the dustpan.

17:55.273 --> 17:57.138
Is she okay?

17:57.175 --> 17:58.472
Yeah, she's fine.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.875
Look, I'll do this.

18:00.912 --> 18:02.311
So, what's for dinner?

18:02.347 --> 18:04.212
- What?
- Dinner.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.910
You know, the meal you eat
at the end of the day.

18:05.951 --> 18:07.543
You did invite us
for dinner, didn't you?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.383
Hey, I was just doing
you guys a favor.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.618
And besides, I don't have
enough for you guys.

18:12.657 --> 18:14.852
And I need you out of my house
before my mother gets home,

18:14.893 --> 18:16.952
because, uh, she'll have
my butt for this.

18:16.995 --> 18:18.155
For what?

18:18.196 --> 18:19.686
Come on now, don't play dumb.

18:19.731 --> 18:22.598
I mean, you see what's
going on here, don't you?

18:22.634 --> 18:24.363
If the child welfare lady
ever finds out

18:24.402 --> 18:27.166
she leaves us here alone,
we'd be outta here.

18:27.205 --> 18:30.265
Well, hey, we're not going
to tell anyone. Are we?

18:30.308 --> 18:32.640
Of course not.

18:32.677 --> 18:34.474
Besides, we're the ones
springing for pizza.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.744
- Oh, hey.
- Hi. What's your name?

18:38.783 --> 18:40.250
I'm Donna.
What's your name?

18:40.285 --> 18:41.650
My name is Benjamin.

18:41.686 --> 18:43.847
- Benjamin, do you like pizza?
- Yes.

18:43.888 --> 18:45.253
Yes, well, that's what
we're having for dinner.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.279
- Yes!
- Yes!

18:47.926 --> 18:49.257
Pizza, pizza.

18:49.294 --> 18:53.458
Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza.

18:53.531 --> 18:57.524
Pizza, pizza,
pizza, pizza...

18:59.604 --> 19:03.199
Ten down. It's hard ten...

19:03.241 --> 19:05.141
Yes. Winner.
Whoo, what a rush.

19:05.176 --> 19:06.643
I'm gonna go get
some more chips.

19:06.678 --> 19:09.545
Oh, no, you can, uh,
you can borrow some of mine.

19:09.581 --> 19:12.345
If you're a really good boy,
I won't even charge interest.

19:12.384 --> 19:14.079
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

19:20.358 --> 19:22.189
Oh, Lisa, you are on fire.

19:22.227 --> 19:23.694
You gotta try this.
It's a blast.

19:23.728 --> 19:25.389
Yeah, I bet, when
you win like this.

19:25.430 --> 19:26.692
Where's Donna?

19:26.731 --> 19:28.198
That is actually what I was
coming to ask you.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.428
We were supposed to meet here
after she got off work.

19:30.535 --> 19:32.264
Oh, well, it's only 8:00.

19:32.303 --> 19:33.827
Maybe she's putting in overtime.

19:33.872 --> 19:35.237
No way.

19:35.273 --> 19:37.605
When it comes to time and
a half, Stan's too cheap.

19:37.642 --> 19:38.870
Donna will be here real soon.

19:38.910 --> 19:41.845
- Wow.
- Oh, my!

19:41.880 --> 19:43.211
I'm gonna let it ride.

19:46.251 --> 19:48.242
Happy birthday.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.046
Happy birthday.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.420
Blow out your candles.

19:52.457 --> 19:53.446
One more.

19:53.491 --> 19:54.788
Yay!

19:57.462 --> 19:59.362
Yay!

19:59.397 --> 20:00.386
Here.

20:00.432 --> 20:01.456
Did you bake that?

20:01.566 --> 20:03.090
No, Mom baked it this morning,

20:03.134 --> 20:04.931
but I did the icing
and the letters.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.067
You like it?

20:07.105 --> 20:08.436
Yes.

20:08.473 --> 20:09.599
Then what'd you say?

20:09.641 --> 20:11.905
Thank you, Isaiah.

20:11.943 --> 20:12.967
I want cake.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.376
No cake until you're
in your pajamas.

20:14.412 --> 20:16.471
Hustle up.
Come on, let's go.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.483
You really are the man
of the house, aren't you?

20:19.551 --> 20:22.042
Yeah, it's just the way it is.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.988
Mom works in the morning
when we're all at school,

20:25.023 --> 20:27.491
and then she's got school,
too, herself.

20:27.525 --> 20:29.117
She's gonna be
a real nurse next year.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.025
Well, I'd like to meet her.

20:31.062 --> 20:32.962
Yeah, well, she'll be home soon,

20:32.997 --> 20:34.931
and, boy, am I going
to get in trouble.

20:34.966 --> 20:38.026
Why don't you get your brother
and sister ready for bed,

20:38.069 --> 20:40.435
and Joe and I will clean
this up.

20:40.472 --> 20:41.837
And don't worry about your mom.

20:41.873 --> 20:43.067
I'll talk to her.

20:43.108 --> 20:44.234
You sure?

20:44.275 --> 20:45.503
Yeah, I'm sure.

20:45.543 --> 20:47.238
Okay.

20:50.148 --> 20:51.672
He really is incredible.

20:51.716 --> 20:54.344
Yeah. He's got it all
under control.

20:54.385 --> 20:56.148
We better get going.

20:57.388 --> 20:59.515
Donna, this isn't right,
butting into their life.

20:59.624 --> 21:02.058
Well, leaving them here alone
isn't right, either.

21:02.093 --> 21:04.789
Maybe their mother
can do it, but I can't.

21:11.302 --> 21:13.634
Who are you?
What are you doing in my house?

21:13.671 --> 21:14.865
Look, it's all
right, Mrs. Holcomb.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.100
Who the hell are you people?

21:16.141 --> 21:17.335
Your son helped us out.

21:17.375 --> 21:18.569
We ran out of gas.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.601
Oh, I see. So what
are you still doing here?

21:20.645 --> 21:23.876
The kids were all alone and...
well, we bought them pizza.

21:23.915 --> 21:26.941
I see. How much do I
owe you for the pizza?

21:26.985 --> 21:28.782
No, no, no, nothing.
It was our pleasure.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.481
No. I said,
how much do I owe you?

21:30.588 --> 21:33.079
Let's call it even,
for letting us use your phone.

21:33.124 --> 21:37.026
Look,
Isaiah's a remarkable boy.

21:37.061 --> 21:38.028
That's right, he is.

21:38.062 --> 21:38.960
He's 11.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.123
He is more than capable.

21:40.165 --> 21:42.190
- Yes, I know that.
- Look, I wear a beeper.

21:42.233 --> 21:44.064
Isaiah knows
all of his neighbors.

21:44.102 --> 21:47.970
Look, I don't have
to explain myself to you.

21:48.006 --> 21:49.906
I'm sorry.

21:49.941 --> 21:52.307
But those kids
were left here alone all day.

21:52.343 --> 21:54.402
Oh. So, what are you gonna do?

21:54.445 --> 21:56.777
Call Social Services,
have them come in here

21:56.815 --> 21:59.147
and yank these kids
away from their mother?

21:59.184 --> 22:01.618
No, of course not.

22:02.654 --> 22:06.454
You come in here
and you judge me.

22:06.524 --> 22:09.015
You don't know me.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.994
You don't know my problems.

22:14.766 --> 22:18.725
Look, I'm asking you,
please, leave us be.

22:18.770 --> 22:22.103
We're a family;
we can take care of ourselves.

22:38.056 --> 22:39.489
Hey, what's up?
What do you need?

22:39.524 --> 22:41.685
Hey, man, uh, give me
a hundred dollars' worth.

22:41.726 --> 22:43.387
Didn't you mean another hundred?

22:43.428 --> 22:46.488
Nat, first you play my father,
now my accountant.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.998
What's next, my priest?

22:48.032 --> 22:49.590
If necessary.

22:49.634 --> 22:50.760
Thanks, man.

22:50.802 --> 22:52.429
Look, we've been over this.

22:52.470 --> 22:54.665
I screwed up once,
three years ago.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.469
Don't you think
the statute of limitations

22:56.507 --> 22:58.270
has run out on that by now?

22:59.310 --> 23:01.471
Can't say I do.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.078
Yo, this number's filled, yo.

23:11.089 --> 23:13.080
Come on, double fours.

23:18.263 --> 23:20.128
- You having fun yet?
- This is great.

23:20.164 --> 23:21.461
Absolutely.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.056
Give me some luck on that.

23:23.101 --> 23:24.398
Thank you.

23:24.435 --> 23:27.836
Ten, ten, mark it a ten.

23:27.872 --> 23:30.340
Do you have any idea
how to play this game?

23:30.375 --> 23:32.172
Sure. I do whatever
Brandon does,

23:32.210 --> 23:34.144
and bet about a tenth as much.

23:34.178 --> 23:37.011
Okay, give me the hard ten,
high low, horn bet, world bet,

23:37.048 --> 23:38.811
and one for the boys and the yo.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.283
Hey, Brandon, how much
you got out there?

23:40.318 --> 23:41.444
About a nickel on the inside.

23:41.486 --> 23:42.817
If you were smart,
you'd come with me.

23:42.854 --> 23:45.152
Uh, no, sir, I think I'll
be playing the field.

23:45.189 --> 23:47.714
Brave.

23:47.759 --> 23:48.987
Nine. Nine.
Gonna fill it. Nine.

23:49.027 --> 23:50.085
Thank you!

23:51.763 --> 23:54.254
- No, no, no, let that ride.
- What, are you crazy?

23:54.299 --> 23:55.994
No.

23:56.034 --> 23:57.899
Nat, will you please
talk some sense into him?

23:57.936 --> 23:59.096
I tried that already.

23:59.137 --> 24:00.695
Yeah, you did,
and look where I am now.

24:00.738 --> 24:02.763
I am looking, and I
don't like what I see.

24:02.807 --> 24:04.365
Then I suggest you turn around.

24:05.643 --> 24:08.271
No, I got a better idea.

24:09.247 --> 24:11.442
Nat, what are you doing?

24:11.549 --> 24:12.948
Wow.

24:12.984 --> 24:14.349
Big spender.

24:14.385 --> 24:16.649
You're betting against me?

24:16.688 --> 24:18.315
Everything I got.

24:21.259 --> 24:22.283
Let's go, Brandon.

24:24.295 --> 24:26.786
The point's ten,
shooter, let 'em fly.

24:27.832 --> 24:29.561
Seven! Out and out.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.058
There was no ten. Loser!

24:34.105 --> 24:35.470
Happy now?

24:35.506 --> 24:38.134
Oh, yeah. I'm very happy.

24:38.176 --> 24:40.201
Good.

24:54.058 --> 24:57.653
Excuse me, I was told
I could find Steve Sanders here.

24:57.695 --> 24:59.959
Yeah, he'll be back in a second.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.262
- Why, who's inquiring?
- His boss.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.097
Oh, you're Tammy Kane?

25:04.135 --> 25:05.466
Yeah.

25:08.039 --> 25:10.530
Oh, there he is.
Excuse me.

25:12.243 --> 25:13.437
- Tammy.
- Yeah.

25:13.478 --> 25:14.968
What are you doing here?

25:15.013 --> 25:17.641
- Did I mess up?
- No, you did great.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.445
Could we talk?

25:19.517 --> 25:21.781
- Sure.
- Someplace quiet?

25:21.819 --> 25:24.982
Okay. Why don't we go next door.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.513
Excuse me.

25:35.099 --> 25:37.260
Nice to meet you, too.

25:39.303 --> 25:41.464
I don't know what to do.

25:41.572 --> 25:43.472
What can you do?

25:43.574 --> 25:46.042
Steve, you don't know how hard
I worked to get this job.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.840
I didn't grow up in the business

25:47.879 --> 25:49.676
like you did... I need this job.

25:51.516 --> 25:54.974
If I get fired from this agency,
no one will touch me.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.754
I'm sorry, I don't know
what to say, Tammy.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.724
Say you'll help me.

26:00.758 --> 26:02.055
Please.

26:02.093 --> 26:06.257
Look, I know I haven't
been that nice to you.

26:06.297 --> 26:08.094
I'm desperate.

26:08.132 --> 26:11.101
You know Scott Coveny,
your dad knows him...

26:11.135 --> 26:12.966
you could talk to him.

26:13.004 --> 26:15.165
Please, I'm begging.

26:16.607 --> 26:18.666
I'm an intern.

26:18.709 --> 26:21.177
An intern who's tight
with the agency president.

26:22.213 --> 26:24.704
Steve...

26:25.750 --> 26:27.980
...I promise you,

26:28.019 --> 26:31.921
the further up the ladder I go,
the further up you go.

26:36.828 --> 26:39.058
Okay. First thing
Monday morning,

26:39.097 --> 26:41.327
I'll go in
and have a talk with him.

26:41.365 --> 26:42.832
No, that-that won't do.

26:42.867 --> 26:44.164
Um, you don't understand.

26:44.202 --> 26:46.568
I don't think I can make it
through the weekend.

26:46.604 --> 26:47.935
I don't know where he lives.

26:47.972 --> 26:50.236
Come on, he's probably home
with his kids right now.

26:50.274 --> 26:51.798
No, he's not,
he's in the office,

26:51.843 --> 26:53.834
where he is every night
until 11:00 p.m.

26:56.347 --> 26:58.212
Please?

27:02.553 --> 27:05.852
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

27:07.158 --> 27:08.785
Great.

27:24.542 --> 27:26.840
Clare, I've got
to sneak out of here

27:26.878 --> 27:28.243
for about an hour or so.

27:28.279 --> 27:29.439
Oh, really? Why?

27:29.514 --> 27:31.141
Gonna mix business
with pleasure?

27:31.182 --> 27:33.912
There's no pleasure involved,
believe me, Clare.

27:33.951 --> 27:36.749
Hmm. So, where you going?

27:36.787 --> 27:39.119
Uh... mission of mercy.

27:46.364 --> 27:48.389
Hello? May have
your attention up here?

27:48.432 --> 27:50.832
Ladies and gentlemen,

27:50.868 --> 27:53.063
I would like to thank you all
for coming out,

27:53.104 --> 27:54.833
and especially
for opening up your hearts

27:54.872 --> 27:57.466
and your wallets
for a great cause.

27:57.542 --> 27:58.770
Alpha House...

27:58.809 --> 28:01.004
Hey, uh, lend me
a hundred bucks, would you?

28:01.045 --> 28:03.605
- No. - What, are you afraid
I'm not gonna pay you back?

28:03.648 --> 28:05.843
No, I don't think you should
gamble anymore tonight.

28:05.883 --> 28:07.680
Well, thank you very much.

28:07.718 --> 28:08.810
Look at you.

28:08.853 --> 28:09.945
You're sweating.

28:09.987 --> 28:11.545
It's hot in here.

28:11.589 --> 28:13.216
Maybe they'll take a check.

28:13.257 --> 28:14.815
You don't know when to quit.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.520
And you don't know
when to lay off.

28:16.561 --> 28:17.823
I know you're all anxious
for the auction to begin,

28:17.862 --> 28:20.092
but first I would like
to thank Valerie Malone

28:20.131 --> 28:22.599
for donating the After Dark.

28:22.633 --> 28:24.100
And, um, that's it.

28:24.135 --> 28:26.365
So now we're going
to close down the casino action

28:26.404 --> 28:29.430
and let everybody get a chance
to participate in the auction.

28:29.473 --> 28:31.168
Our auctioneer for this evening

28:31.209 --> 28:34.645
is The Peach Pit's
very own Nat Bussichio.

28:36.614 --> 28:39.208
Thank you, my sweetheart.

28:39.250 --> 28:40.911
All right, everyone,
let's have some fun

28:40.952 --> 28:43.182
because I want you to come up
with a lot of money

28:43.221 --> 28:45.815
'cause the very first item
we have up for bid

28:45.856 --> 28:47.847
is really special.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.359
It's going to be a day

28:49.393 --> 28:52.624
with California University's
Chancellor A. Milton Arnold.

28:52.663 --> 28:54.324
So, let's start
with the bidding over here.

28:54.365 --> 28:55.627
What do we got over here?

28:55.666 --> 28:58.726
Who the heck would want to bid
on a day with my father?

28:58.769 --> 29:00.361
Oh, come on,
in a crowd like this,

29:00.404 --> 29:03.271
there's got to be at
least one brownnoser.

29:03.307 --> 29:05.070
Yeah, too bad Steve left, huh?

29:05.109 --> 29:06.906
Very smart move... $60.

29:06.944 --> 29:09.412
Come on, now, this is the guy
that runs the university. $65.

29:09.447 --> 29:10.414
We got a 70?

29:10.514 --> 29:11.879
Seventy dollars.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.679
What do you mean
I can't get any more chips?

29:13.718 --> 29:16.152
Listen, there's no play
during the auction.

29:16.187 --> 29:18.712
And he was so looking forward
to contributing more to charity.

29:18.756 --> 29:20.849
Come on, let's go.

29:20.891 --> 29:22.381
I want a chance to get even.

29:22.426 --> 29:25.589
You're embarrassing me and
you're embarrassing yourself.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.393
- Brandon, just relax.
- I want some more chips.

29:27.431 --> 29:28.796
Will you get Steve out here?

29:28.833 --> 29:30.027
I don't know what the
hell is wrong with you,

29:30.067 --> 29:31.193
but I don't like it.

29:32.737 --> 29:34.136
I'm leaving.

29:34.171 --> 29:37.732
Going twice.

29:37.775 --> 29:39.640
- $300.
- We got $300.

29:39.677 --> 29:41.406
Do I hear $350?

29:41.445 --> 29:42.776
Do I hear $350?

29:42.813 --> 29:44.212
Oh, come on, folks.

29:44.248 --> 29:45.840
This is an opportunity

29:45.883 --> 29:48.716
to sit for a Colin Robbins
original portrait

29:48.753 --> 29:50.277
that we're auctioning off here.

29:50.321 --> 29:52.255
Looks like you're stuck with me.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.121
Fine by me; there's
no one I'd rather paint.

29:54.158 --> 29:56.149
Now, do I hear $350?

29:56.193 --> 29:57.592
Do I hear $350?

29:57.628 --> 30:00.062
- $400.
- $400!

30:00.097 --> 30:01.064
We've got $400.

30:01.098 --> 30:02.929
Do I hear $450? $450?

30:02.967 --> 30:05.162
Didn't think I'd let you have it
without a fight, did you?

30:05.202 --> 30:06.226
Do I hear $450?

30:06.270 --> 30:07.464
Do I hear $450?
We've got $400.

30:07.505 --> 30:08.995
Do I hear $450?

30:09.040 --> 30:10.667
$425.

30:10.708 --> 30:11.834
$450.

30:11.876 --> 30:13.810
- $500.
- $600.

30:13.844 --> 30:15.971
$600!

30:16.013 --> 30:18.709
Do I hear $625?

30:18.749 --> 30:20.341
Do I hear $625?

30:20.384 --> 30:21.942
Do I hear $625?

30:21.986 --> 30:23.851
This is ridiculous.

30:23.888 --> 30:26.288
You don't want to pay that much.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.689
$600 once,

30:27.725 --> 30:30.125
$600 twice.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.128
I'm out.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.493
Sold to Valerie Malone.

30:32.596 --> 30:36.088
Sold for $600!

30:41.872 --> 30:42.998
It's not worth it.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.735
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

30:45.776 --> 30:48.267
What are you up to?

30:48.312 --> 30:51.748
Look, I don't have to
explain anything to you.

30:51.782 --> 30:53.943
You could've outbid me if
it was important to you.

30:55.086 --> 30:56.986
Apparently it wasn't.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.002
Ah, burning the midnight oil?

31:19.043 --> 31:21.341
Actually, I was just on my way
to your office to speak to you.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.812
- Oh yeah?
- What's up?

31:22.847 --> 31:24.474
Tammy Kane.

31:24.582 --> 31:25.742
She's...

31:25.783 --> 31:28.479
- She's...
- She sent you, didn't she?

31:28.519 --> 31:30.817
No.

31:30.855 --> 31:32.755
Not really.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.821
Are you sleeping with her,
Stevie?

31:35.860 --> 31:38.385
No, of course not.

31:38.429 --> 31:40.420
Well, neither am I.

31:40.464 --> 31:42.955
Though maybe if I was,
it could have saved her job.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.060
You see, she's a lousy agent.

31:46.103 --> 31:48.264
She's bright,

31:48.305 --> 31:49.329
she's artistically bent,

31:49.373 --> 31:51.136
but she has no commercial sense

31:51.175 --> 31:53.268
and she's costing us clients.

31:53.310 --> 31:55.471
Oh. Oh, boy.

31:55.513 --> 31:56.912
Rules number one and two:

31:56.947 --> 31:58.608
never get emotional.

31:58.649 --> 32:01.413
It's not personal,
it's business.

32:03.020 --> 32:05.955
Yeah, but what
should I tell her?

32:05.990 --> 32:08.754
Well, if you've got any future
in this town,

32:08.793 --> 32:10.920
you'll know what to say.

32:19.370 --> 32:22.134
BMW.

32:22.173 --> 32:24.164
Porsche.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.446
Cadillac.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.711
Where I'm from, you hardly
ever see cars like this.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.014
A Rolls Royce cruising
down Main Street?

32:35.052 --> 32:36.781
I don't think so.

32:36.821 --> 32:38.482
We've got it pretty good,
don't we?

32:38.522 --> 32:39.614
You bet we do.

32:39.657 --> 32:43.218
I guess tonight was
just sort of a reminder.

32:43.260 --> 32:44.852
Yeah, but...

32:44.895 --> 32:47.489
you can't feel guilty
for what you have in life.

32:47.531 --> 32:49.761
I know.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.631
I love my life...

32:51.669 --> 32:52.795
my life and you.

32:52.837 --> 32:54.270
Good.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.068
You tell yourself
you deserve it.

32:56.106 --> 33:00.736
I know I deserve it.

33:00.778 --> 33:03.303
But does Isaiah deserve
to lose his childhood?

33:03.347 --> 33:06.282
Who's to say that Isaiah's
childhood experiences

33:06.317 --> 33:08.046
won't turn him into
a great leader someday?

33:08.085 --> 33:09.279
Yeah.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.847
Well, who's to say
that it won't break him?

33:14.825 --> 33:17.453
I just feel for him, that's all.

33:17.528 --> 33:20.361
I know.

33:27.705 --> 33:29.195
There you are.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.639
Where have you guys been?

33:30.674 --> 33:32.904
- Car trouble.
- Baby-sitting.

33:32.943 --> 33:34.604
Uh, can I get you ladies
a drink?

33:34.645 --> 33:35.839
Yeah.
I'll take something.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.370
- Anything, please.
- All right.

33:38.816 --> 33:40.477
You remember that kid Isaiah?

33:40.584 --> 33:43.178
Yeah, the one Stan
rousted for shoplifting?

33:43.220 --> 33:46.280
Yeah, did you know
he was a latchkey kid?

33:46.323 --> 33:48.223
Did you know that he's
at home playing dad

33:48.259 --> 33:49.783
while his mom's at work?

33:49.827 --> 33:51.488
How do you know that?

33:51.595 --> 33:52.721
Well, Joe's car ran out of gas,

33:52.763 --> 33:54.094
and he saved us.

33:54.131 --> 33:56.099
Look, this kid
is doing all he can

33:56.133 --> 33:58.067
to keep it together
for his family.

33:58.102 --> 33:59.933
I just feel like I need
to do something.

33:59.970 --> 34:02.905
In case you didn't know, this is
not Adopt a Black Family Month.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.931
So what does that mean?

34:04.975 --> 34:07.603
It's not politically correct
to try to help them?

34:07.645 --> 34:10.079
No, what I'm saying is
I don't think it's right for you

34:10.114 --> 34:11.411
to butt in on someone
else's business.

34:11.447 --> 34:14.246
Lisa, these kids were left home
alone, unsupervised.

34:14.284 --> 34:15.980
But they're not your kids,
Donna.

34:17.288 --> 34:18.414
I know that.

34:18.455 --> 34:19.820
And you can't save everybody.

34:19.857 --> 34:22.417
I don't want to save everybody.
I want to help them.

34:22.458 --> 34:25.326
And if I can't, if I don't,

34:25.362 --> 34:27.556
then I sure as hell don't belong
on this Rose Court.

34:27.598 --> 34:29.657
I mean, what's the theme
that we've been

34:29.699 --> 34:30.996
talking about since day one?

34:31.034 --> 34:33.469
"Kids, Laughter and Dreams."

34:33.536 --> 34:35.562
Is that real
or all just a bunch of bull?

34:35.606 --> 34:38.130
- No, I... - And what's this
supposed to be about tonight?

34:38.175 --> 34:39.733
Supporting Kid Kare?

34:39.777 --> 34:41.870
And all the child relief
agencies?

34:41.911 --> 34:43.812
I mean, somewhere... somewhere
between the two of them

34:43.847 --> 34:46.246
there's got to be a way
to help this family.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.580
Saint Donna.

34:57.061 --> 34:58.494
Hey, what are you doing?

34:58.562 --> 35:00.257
Hey, I was looking
all over for you.

35:00.297 --> 35:01.525
Did you see the bidding?

35:01.565 --> 35:02.691
Wasn't it exciting?

35:02.733 --> 35:06.100
Yeah, it gave me the chills.

35:06.136 --> 35:09.731
So, what do you think,
three-quarters or profile?

35:09.773 --> 35:12.640
Why don't you ask Colin?
He's the artist.

35:12.676 --> 35:14.200
Why are you in such a bad mood?

35:14.244 --> 35:17.008
I'm the one who's writing
this incredibly large check.

35:17.047 --> 35:18.639
Yeah, well, just think
of all the time

35:18.682 --> 35:20.650
it'll buy you with Colin.

35:20.684 --> 35:22.379
Is that what you think?

35:22.419 --> 35:24.444
I did this to get
close to Colin?

35:24.488 --> 35:26.683
Well, you outbid Kel,
you way overpaid.

35:26.724 --> 35:28.055
What else am I supposed
to think, Val?

35:42.873 --> 35:43.931
So, how did it go?

35:43.974 --> 35:45.703
He thinks the world of you.

35:45.743 --> 35:46.710
He does?

35:46.744 --> 35:48.075
Yeah.
Big time.

35:48.112 --> 35:49.807
He really appreciates
how smart you are,

35:49.847 --> 35:52.281
he admires your artistic bent.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.113
I knew it had to be a mistake.

35:54.151 --> 35:55.675
Actually, he thinks
it's his mistake.

35:55.719 --> 35:58.153
He thinks he's doing you
a disservice at the agency.

35:58.188 --> 36:00.679
How so?

36:00.724 --> 36:01.952
Well, how'd he put it?

36:01.992 --> 36:04.825
He feels that your potential
is being stifled

36:04.862 --> 36:06.853
in the corporate environment.

36:06.897 --> 36:09.365
He thinks ITM is the wrong place
for your talents.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.527
He doesn't want to hold you back
another day.

36:13.871 --> 36:15.202
I'm dead, aren't I?

36:15.239 --> 36:17.070
Totally.

36:17.107 --> 36:19.041
I'm sorry, Tammy.

36:19.076 --> 36:21.840
Don't be.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.540
You're going to do great
in this business, Steve.

36:23.580 --> 36:24.808
You sell a hell of a line.

36:26.550 --> 36:29.280
I know it was all a lie anyway,
but it made me feel better.

36:29.319 --> 36:32.015
What are you going to do?

36:32.056 --> 36:35.048
I could write a tell-all book.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.024
My father told me
a very interesting saying

36:39.063 --> 36:40.155
about this business.

36:40.197 --> 36:41.289
What's that?

36:41.331 --> 36:42.992
Be nice to people
on your way up.

36:43.033 --> 36:47.402
You'll be seeing them
on your way up again.

36:47.438 --> 36:50.373
You got it.

36:50.407 --> 36:51.965
I'll see you on the way up.

36:52.009 --> 36:53.408
No doubt.

37:04.788 --> 37:06.517
Thanks.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.320
Good luck.

37:20.904 --> 37:22.371
You win tonight?

37:22.406 --> 37:23.839
You don't want to know.

37:23.874 --> 37:25.535
Mmm.

37:31.682 --> 37:34.082
Nat?

37:34.118 --> 37:36.985
You were right.

37:37.020 --> 37:39.318
I was out of line,
and I'm sorry.

37:40.357 --> 37:43.383
You got a problem.

37:43.427 --> 37:45.895
You better start
taking it seriously

37:45.929 --> 37:49.057
or you're going to lose
something important to you.

37:49.099 --> 37:51.192
I think I may
have already done that.

37:54.371 --> 37:55.599
Yeah.

38:06.183 --> 38:07.275
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:07.317 --> 38:08.614
Here you go.

38:08.652 --> 38:10.847
Wow, boy, you really
broke the bank.

38:10.888 --> 38:12.412
Just give me a minute
to count this.

38:12.523 --> 38:14.218
No, that's okay,
I don't want any prizes.

38:14.258 --> 38:15.418
No prizes?

38:15.526 --> 38:17.221
What's wrong with you, Clare?

38:17.261 --> 38:19.855
Steve, I didn't
do this for prizes.

38:19.897 --> 38:22.365
You know, I just did it
to see if I could.

38:24.001 --> 38:26.435
So, how's your boss?

38:26.537 --> 38:28.402
I had to fire her.

38:28.438 --> 38:30.702
Hmm, tough business, huh?

38:30.741 --> 38:32.333
Clare, you don't
know the half of it.

38:32.376 --> 38:33.604
Come here.

38:43.453 --> 38:46.047
Uh, if you're looking
for Clare or Donna,

38:46.089 --> 38:47.147
they've both gone to bed.

38:47.191 --> 38:48.749
Actually, I was looking for you.

38:48.792 --> 38:50.384
We got the totals tonight.

38:50.427 --> 38:52.793
After expenses, we made $11,000.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.855
Well, that's good news...

38:54.898 --> 38:56.798
that you could've given me
over the phone.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.394
Well, I couldn't have apologized
to you in person then.

38:59.436 --> 39:02.701
And what exactly would you
be apologizing for, Valerie?

39:02.739 --> 39:05.139
I'm not exactly sure.

39:05.175 --> 39:08.235
David got so mad at me
that I had to spoil the surprise

39:08.278 --> 39:10.508
and tell him that the portrait
was his Christmas present.

39:11.548 --> 39:13.243
His Christmas present?

39:15.419 --> 39:18.183
Well, then, I guess
I owe you an apology.

39:18.222 --> 39:19.553
Forget it.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.421
The only thing you have
to apologize for

39:21.525 --> 39:22.890
is bidding up the price.

39:22.926 --> 39:25.326
You cost me a small fortune.

39:25.362 --> 39:26.954
Good.

39:26.997 --> 39:28.897
- Hi, Val.
- Hi.

39:28.932 --> 39:30.729
We made over $11,000 tonight.

39:30.767 --> 39:33.600
Wow, that's gonna help
a lot of families.

39:33.637 --> 39:36.162
Then, why do you look
so unhappy?

39:37.207 --> 39:38.435
Because there's one family

39:38.475 --> 39:40.409
I don't think wants
to be helped.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.852
I hope there's a good reason
for why you're here,

39:58.896 --> 40:00.454
because after the way
you behaved last night,

40:00.530 --> 40:03.226
I'm not sure I even know you.

40:03.267 --> 40:05.428
In some ways, you don't.

40:08.605 --> 40:10.732
Come on in.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.275
A couple of years ago, I, uh...

40:24.221 --> 40:26.018
...got into some trouble
with a bookie

40:26.056 --> 40:27.523
betting on football games.

40:28.558 --> 40:30.150
Did, uh... did it get

40:30.193 --> 40:32.093
as out of control
as it did last night?

40:33.130 --> 40:34.688
Worse.

40:37.534 --> 40:39.092
I lost a lot of money.

40:39.136 --> 40:40.728
I would have lost more than that

40:40.771 --> 40:42.966
if a good friend of mine
hadn't bailed me out.

40:45.042 --> 40:46.339
Nat?

40:47.377 --> 40:48.969
Yeah.

40:51.381 --> 40:55.249
Even after that, though,
I'd sit down at a poker game

40:55.285 --> 40:58.083
and take any bet
that came along.

40:58.121 --> 41:00.715
I didn't even think twice
about it.

41:04.995 --> 41:07.463
You saying you have
a gambling problem?

41:09.633 --> 41:11.658
Look what happened last night.

41:15.238 --> 41:19.140
Guess you can't
be a little addicted.

41:21.545 --> 41:23.706
No, you can't.

41:24.748 --> 41:27.979
You know, I knew
I had a problem.

41:28.018 --> 41:32.182
I thought I had it
under control.

41:32.222 --> 41:34.053
But I don't.

41:40.364 --> 41:41.763
I'd like to help you.

41:43.867 --> 41:45.767
If you'll let me.

42:09.593 --> 42:11.220
- Watch out for him.
- All right.

42:13.363 --> 42:15.194
Mrs. Holcomb.

42:15.232 --> 42:17.598
Look, I'm really sorry
for intruding

42:17.634 --> 42:19.829
into your home
and into your life.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.303
I had no business.

42:21.338 --> 42:22.930
Believe me, I wouldn't
have come down here

42:22.973 --> 42:25.407
to meet you at all if Isaiah
hadn't twisted my arm.

42:25.442 --> 42:28.434
Been on this day care list
for over two years now.

42:28.478 --> 42:29.911
I'd given up hope.

42:29.946 --> 42:32.278
Well, see,
that's where I can help.

42:32.315 --> 42:35.045
My sorority raises a lot
of money for this place.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.677
I know the people here.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.153
I can get the kids in.

42:39.189 --> 42:40.816
Of course, I would
never do that

42:40.857 --> 42:42.085
without your permission.

42:42.125 --> 42:43.990
Well, that's very charitable
of you,

42:44.027 --> 42:45.517
but I don't want your handouts.

42:46.730 --> 42:50.393
Look, I'm not a do-gooder,
Mrs. Holcomb.

42:50.434 --> 42:52.766
And it's not charity.

42:52.803 --> 42:56.068
Anything I can do for you...

42:56.106 --> 42:58.301
I'm offering out of friendship.

42:58.341 --> 43:00.002
Mama, Mama,

43:00.043 --> 43:01.704
come watch me!

43:01.745 --> 43:03.144
I'll be right there, honey.

43:07.451 --> 43:10.386
I guess we all need
a little help sometimes in life.

43:13.423 --> 43:15.118
And I'm not too proud
to take it.

43:15.158 --> 43:16.216
Thank you.

43:17.260 --> 43:18.921
Thank you very much.

43:21.264 --> 43:23.061
You're welcome.

43:26.970 --> 43:28.460
Come on.

43:28.572 --> 43:30.563
Isaiah.

43:30.607 --> 43:33.007
- Hey.
- Hi.

43:34.044 --> 43:35.477
Look, I... I just want
to tell you

43:35.579 --> 43:37.069
how glad I am that I met you.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.345
Me, too.

43:41.718 --> 43:42.878
Thanks for everything.

43:42.919 --> 43:45.717
Um, I owe you a lot more
than five dollars now,

43:45.755 --> 43:47.916
and I don't know how
I can ever repay you.

43:48.959 --> 43:50.483
I'll tell you how.

43:50.527 --> 43:52.051
When you grow up,

43:52.095 --> 43:54.359
do the same thing
for someone else someday.

43:54.397 --> 43:55.728
I will.

43:55.765 --> 43:56.891
I promise.

43:57.934 --> 43:59.663
I won't forget.

43:59.703 --> 44:01.603
Okay.
