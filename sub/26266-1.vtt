02:31.027 --> 02:31.861
Thank you.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.494
Dad, this wood is really good for feathering.

02:44.666 --> 02:45.583
It's really nice work.

03:39.304 --> 03:40.138
Thank you.

04:44.494 --> 04:45.328
Look.

04:47.372 --> 04:48.498
Oh.

04:49.165 --> 04:50.166
Excellent haul.

04:50.708 --> 04:51.542
Need help?

04:52.752 --> 04:54.212
Uh, could you tighten that?

04:54.796 --> 04:55.630
Screw right here.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.677
- Yeah.
- Hold it. Yep.

05:02.053 --> 05:03.262
Will it cook a mushroom?

05:03.638 --> 05:05.056
It should cook a mushroom.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.145
- You put it on here?
- Just like that.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.822
- It might take a while.
- Take a little bit.

05:25.994 --> 05:26.828
Shoo.

05:27.412 --> 05:29.956
Shoo. Shoo.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.857
Seems like the pack has gotten bigger.

05:32.786 --> 05:33.884
Yeah.

05:34.711 --> 05:35.545
Shoo.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.213
Shoo.

05:46.973 --> 05:48.599
- You need an extra layer?
- Yeah.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.536
That's leaking a lot.

06:09.037 --> 06:10.204
Will you hand me the tape?

06:16.544 --> 06:17.545
How we looking?

06:17.628 --> 06:19.088
This one needs another piece.

06:21.799 --> 06:22.675
Here as well.

06:23.760 --> 06:24.677
Well.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.098
You got it?

06:32.685 --> 06:33.519
Okay.

07:13.184 --> 07:14.018
Here.

07:39.335 --> 07:41.254
Dad, it's been really damp.

07:51.681 --> 07:52.515
Dad.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.100
It's okay.

07:55.393 --> 07:56.894
We can use the propane.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.068
Don't waste it, we're low.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.446
I'm hungry.

08:29.635 --> 08:30.469
It's really good.

08:31.512 --> 08:32.513
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

08:42.315 --> 08:44.525
It's okay. It's a work crew.
I saw them earlier.

08:44.609 --> 08:45.776
They're down by the pathways.

08:51.449 --> 08:52.283
Drill.

09:14.222 --> 09:15.056
You're burned.

09:15.932 --> 09:17.975
- Your tracks are all over the place.
- Dad, I can do this.

09:18.059 --> 09:19.894
Well, then, do it well.

09:21.103 --> 09:21.938
Hey.

09:23.189 --> 09:24.023
Do it well.

09:25.775 --> 09:26.609
One more time.

09:27.443 --> 09:28.277
Ten.

09:28.361 --> 09:29.528
- Fifteen.
- Nine.

09:30.446 --> 09:31.280
Eight.

09:32.365 --> 09:33.199
Seven.

09:48.422 --> 09:49.257
Better.

09:50.758 --> 09:51.676
Your socks.

09:52.301 --> 09:53.844
- What?
- Your socks burned you.

09:55.054 --> 09:56.097
You got to muddy them up.

09:57.056 --> 09:58.015
Ankles were down.

09:58.683 --> 09:59.517
Shine.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.018
Shadow.

10:02.228 --> 10:03.062
Shape.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.063
- Dad.
- That's better.

10:04.146 --> 10:05.856
- Come on.
- I'm hungry.

10:41.851 --> 10:43.311
- Dad?
- Hmm.

11:05.750 --> 11:06.834
What's your favorite color?

11:10.796 --> 11:11.756
What's yours?

11:14.383 --> 11:15.217
Yellow.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.189
What was my mother's favorite color?

11:31.525 --> 11:32.401
Yellow.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.239
Maybe she taught me that.

11:41.619 --> 11:42.453
Hmm.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.417
I wish I could remember her.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.047
She would have wished for that, too.

11:57.426 --> 11:58.344
Get some sleep.

12:01.555 --> 12:02.390
It's late.

12:04.767 --> 12:05.851
Goodnight, yellow.

12:08.354 --> 12:09.188
Goodnight.

12:47.476 --> 12:48.853
Why are we going to town today?

12:48.936 --> 12:50.104
Your appetite's growing.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.648
I'm growing.

12:52.731 --> 12:53.649
I know.

12:56.986 --> 12:57.820
See that?

12:58.821 --> 13:00.489
- See my boot, my track?
- Yeah.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.660
Yeah, I think we need a new path.

13:13.711 --> 13:14.545
Dad.

13:17.256 --> 13:19.383
If it's still here when we get back,
can I keep it?

13:25.973 --> 13:26.974
Yeah, that's fair.

13:28.601 --> 13:29.477
Cool.

13:31.645 --> 13:32.563
Uh-uh.

13:33.522 --> 13:34.398
In plain view.

13:57.338 --> 13:58.255
Turn around.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.540
<i>The cabin will swing as it passes the tower.</i>

14:33.165 --> 14:34.458
<i>Please watch your balance.</i>

14:56.730 --> 14:59.191
<i>Thank you for riding
the Portland Aerial Tram.</i>

14:59.942 --> 15:03.320
<i>As you exit, look both ways
before crossing the tracks.</i>

15:27.928 --> 15:28.762
Hello.

15:31.432 --> 15:34.310
That's a, ah, kind of...
I'd call it, like, a stress coin.

15:34.393 --> 15:36.979
You put it in your pocket
and have some stress here.

15:37.062 --> 15:40.107
If you have a friend or family member
in trouble that's a vet,

15:40.190 --> 15:43.485
just pull it out and find a phone,
call them up and just press one.

15:43.569 --> 15:44.486
That number.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.655
- Can I take this?
- Absolutely.

15:48.282 --> 15:49.491
That's a gunlock.

15:49.575 --> 15:53.579
It goes in the barrel, keeps them
from accidentally shooting someone.

15:54.163 --> 15:56.874
It gives them time to think
before they commit something wrong,

15:56.957 --> 15:58.959
even worse, so...

16:19.063 --> 16:21.148
- Long or short grain?
- Long.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.865
Dad, can we get these?

16:35.871 --> 16:36.705
Okay.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.415
Want or need?

16:40.834 --> 16:41.669
Both.

16:59.478 --> 17:03.065
"If you are a veteran
who takes benzos for PTSD,

17:03.148 --> 17:04.817
here is what you need to know."

17:05.526 --> 17:06.609
You sell 'em to me.

17:09.113 --> 17:10.071
Xannies.

17:12.241 --> 17:13.075
Prazosin.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.411
When was the last time
that stopped a nightmare?

17:18.288 --> 17:20.124
They're all pretty much useless anyway.

17:20.749 --> 17:24.086
I haven't taken them in two years,
seven months and 28 days.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.214
Can you play your doctor any harder?

17:28.507 --> 17:29.925
I don't want to get flagged.

17:30.384 --> 17:33.804
At first, they're handing 'em out like candy,
then they pull the leash on us.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.725
Anything you get, bring it to me,
I'll take it off your hands.

17:37.808 --> 17:38.642
Yeah.

18:21.435 --> 18:23.270
<i>"Seahorses pair for life.</i>

18:23.353 --> 18:26.148
<i>They find each other

18:26.231 --> 18:28.358
<i>to reinforce their pair-bonding."</i>

18:37.601 --> 18:38.619
Hello?

18:40.704 --> 18:41.830
Somebody up there?

18:43.957 --> 18:44.792
Hello.

18:46.543 --> 18:47.377
Hello?

19:10.317 --> 19:12.736
Is it dangerous to move the pawn
in front of the king?

19:14.488 --> 19:15.572
As long as you castle.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.142
This is not a drill.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.225
<i>They're around here.</i>

20:30.397 --> 20:31.231
Shoo.

20:32.753 --> 20:33.609
Hey.

20:52.002 --> 20:52.878
He's got him.

20:59.468 --> 21:00.636
Good. Stand up.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.306
Still.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.018
Hands on the back of your head.

21:09.895 --> 21:10.729
Hey, still.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.230
Don't move.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.903
Anything on you that's going to hurt me?

21:17.986 --> 21:18.946
Just the knives.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.287
Why were you running?

21:29.831 --> 21:30.791
Huh?

21:31.208 --> 21:32.125
You alone out here?

21:34.544 --> 21:35.629
My daughter's with me.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.340
Tom, come out.

21:41.843 --> 21:42.803
Tom, come out!

21:46.489 --> 21:47.516
Stand up.

21:49.393 --> 21:50.268
Come on.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.187
Dad?

21:55.732 --> 21:57.192
Go down there.

21:59.111 --> 22:03.156
Cooperate. We haven't done anything wrong.
Cooperate.

22:04.992 --> 22:07.327
We don't know who you are
or what's going on. Let's go.

22:10.622 --> 22:11.498
Dad!

22:18.213 --> 22:19.089
Dad?

22:22.300 --> 22:23.135
Dad.

22:23.218 --> 22:24.720
Can you tell me where you live?

22:27.806 --> 22:28.640
In the park?

22:31.810 --> 22:33.353
Just walk down here to me, okay?

22:35.522 --> 22:36.982
I want to go with my dad.

22:38.442 --> 22:40.110
Please. I want to go with my dad.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.529
- I know you do.
- Please. I want to go with my dad.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.197
And you may be able to go with your dad.

22:44.281 --> 22:46.199
But, right now,
we need to ask you some questions.

22:46.283 --> 22:47.325
Why'd you chase us?

22:48.201 --> 22:49.995
We need to figure out what's going on here.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.706
You needed a dog to figure that out?

22:53.165 --> 22:54.041
It's a big park.

23:04.301 --> 23:06.303
I want you to tell me
a little bit about your dad.

23:07.637 --> 23:12.100
Does he drink or take pills
or anything that makes him act strange?

23:14.519 --> 23:17.022
Does he have weapons here,
anything that might hurt somebody?

23:19.149 --> 23:20.108
No.

23:20.984 --> 23:21.818
Okay.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.361
Does he hide things?

23:37.959 --> 23:40.587
This is where we keep our tools
and important papers.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.215
One second.

23:46.384 --> 23:47.302
Thank you.

24:50.991 --> 24:52.409
Are you just going to stand there?

25:17.684 --> 25:18.518
What are you doing?

25:19.686 --> 25:21.229
We're making, um, dream boards.

25:22.439 --> 25:25.358
You cut out pictures that have
to do with your future.

25:25.442 --> 25:31.031
So, like houses or pets or jobs,
stuff like that.

25:31.865 --> 25:33.241
Something to look forward to.

25:33.658 --> 25:35.660
Like, for example, I want love in my future.

25:35.744 --> 25:39.122
So... it's just something
that we do every week,

25:39.206 --> 25:40.624
and it gives us a path.

25:46.129 --> 25:47.589
So, what are you doing here?

25:48.757 --> 25:51.968
I wasn't where I was supposed to be,
so they took me away.

25:52.928 --> 25:56.264
Oh, they don't think
I was where I was supposed to be.

25:57.224 --> 25:58.808
Okay. Where were you?

25:59.976 --> 26:01.478
With my dad, in the park.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.188
So you were homeless, then?

26:04.981 --> 26:05.982
No.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.692
Why else would you be living in the woods?

26:10.487 --> 26:12.489
Okay, if you had a home,
they wouldn't have brought you here.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.658
Well, they just don't understand
that it was my home.

26:19.829 --> 26:20.956
Where's your dad now?

26:23.375 --> 26:24.960
I think he's somewhere in this building.

26:25.961 --> 26:27.045
He's going to come get me.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.673
Tiffany, know anyone
whose parents come for them?

26:30.131 --> 26:30.966
No.

26:31.633 --> 26:32.467
Me neither.

26:53.071 --> 26:56.950
You want to make sure
that you fill in each bubble.

26:57.701 --> 27:01.371
Um, don't make any stray marks,
because the computer will grade this test

27:01.454 --> 27:04.958
and the computer can't tell the difference
between bubbles and doodles.

27:22.142 --> 27:22.976
"D."

27:24.686 --> 27:25.520
"B."

27:28.148 --> 27:29.024
"C."

27:31.776 --> 27:32.610
"A."

27:33.695 --> 27:34.529
"A."

27:40.410 --> 27:41.703
How do you read my answers?

27:42.287 --> 27:44.164
You think
they're going to mean a certain thing?

27:44.622 --> 27:46.875
They might be able to tell us
a little bit more about you.

27:47.876 --> 27:48.960
You could just ask.

27:49.794 --> 27:51.504
Yeah, but you might not be able to say it.

27:52.922 --> 27:54.716
We don't have any record
of you going to school.

27:54.799 --> 27:56.384
Who taught you how to read?

27:56.468 --> 27:57.594
My dad teaches me.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.930
You're actually quite a bit ahead
of where you need to be, but...

28:01.681 --> 28:04.976
school is about social skills, too,
not just intellectual ones.

28:08.563 --> 28:09.689
Can I see my dad now?

28:10.648 --> 28:12.609
Respond true or false to each question.

28:13.193 --> 28:16.196
Um, it's voice activated
so you say it right in the microphone.

28:16.279 --> 28:18.198
There's 435 questions.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.075
If you can't answer something,

28:20.158 --> 28:22.702
you got three seconds, it'll beep
and move on to the next statement.

28:24.579 --> 28:25.538
There you go.

28:27.374 --> 28:30.752
<i>Welcome. The test
will begin in three seconds.</i>

28:33.296 --> 28:36.424
<i>I wake up rested and peaceful most mornings.</i>

28:37.008 --> 28:37.842
True.

28:39.886 --> 28:42.597
<i>I enjoy reading articles on crime.</i>

28:43.473 --> 28:44.307
False.

28:45.392 --> 28:49.354
<i>My day-to-day life is full of things
that keep me interested.</i>

28:50.688 --> 28:51.523
True.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.567
<i>I have nightmares or troubling dreams.</i>

28:57.987 --> 29:01.574
<i>I think about things
that are too bad to talk about.</i>

29:06.162 --> 29:09.249
<i>Things are turning out
like the prophet said they would.</i>

29:12.085 --> 29:13.086
False.

29:15.755 --> 29:18.550
<i>It seems like no one understands me.</i>

29:19.801 --> 29:20.635
False.

29:23.388 --> 29:25.390
- Do you feel safe living with your dad?
- Yes.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.062
I saw that the two of you share a tent.
Has this ever made you feel uncomfortable?

29:31.146 --> 29:31.980
No.

29:32.564 --> 29:34.107
It's warmer with two people at night.

29:34.941 --> 29:35.775
Yeah.

29:36.484 --> 29:38.361
Has anybody ever touched your body
without your permission?

29:38.445 --> 29:39.279
No.

29:40.488 --> 29:41.781
We didn't need to be rescued.

29:42.198 --> 29:45.869
Your dad needs to provide you shelter
and a place to live.

29:45.952 --> 29:46.986
He did.

29:47.829 --> 29:48.788
He does.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.623
It's not a crime to be unhoused.

29:51.082 --> 29:52.125
Many people are.

29:53.293 --> 29:55.378
But it's illegal to live on public land.

29:59.174 --> 30:00.800
Is my dad taking tests like this?

30:05.013 --> 30:06.598
I know there's a lot of questions

30:06.681 --> 30:10.018
and you wouldn't be the first one
to have a problem with this test.

30:10.477 --> 30:11.478
Okay?

30:11.561 --> 30:16.316
Um, but you can only abstain from so many.
I don't want it to count against you.

30:17.317 --> 30:18.526
Okay, so, true or false?

30:20.778 --> 30:21.821
"I'm proud of my daughter."

30:23.448 --> 30:24.282
True.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.622
She's a really wonderful kid.

30:31.748 --> 30:33.333
You did a really great job raising her.

30:36.419 --> 30:38.421
So let's answer as many of these as we can.

30:39.172 --> 30:40.757
"I am a strong team player."

30:42.717 --> 30:43.551
Used to be.

30:44.636 --> 30:45.470
Okay.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.016
"I find it hard to imagine

30:50.099 --> 30:52.894
having a long life and fulfilling my goals."

31:12.205 --> 31:14.666
In finding placement for you and Tom,

31:14.749 --> 31:19.587
we've considered what kind of support
will be most helpful for the both of you.

31:19.796 --> 31:21.839
We'd like to go back
to the way we were living.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.175
We have found an option.

31:26.678 --> 31:27.512
It's not the park.

31:29.138 --> 31:32.725
Um, it's kind of a special accommodation.
It's pretty isolated.

31:32.809 --> 31:36.271
There'd be no rules or regulations
saying you can't live here...

31:37.522 --> 31:39.065
because someone is saying you can.

32:07.135 --> 32:11.055
<i>Traffic has already begun
to back up across the state.</i>

32:11.139 --> 32:14.100
<i>And taking a look
at what the chopper sees, this is...</i>

32:19.522 --> 32:20.648
Where's Forest Park?

32:22.358 --> 32:23.651
It's directly behind us.

33:02.857 --> 33:04.150
This is Mr. Walters.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.194
Hi, Tom. Welcome.

33:06.277 --> 33:07.695
Hey, there. Welcome.

33:16.746 --> 33:19.123
I already got you started
on some basic groceries.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.423
And here's a casserole for later.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.551
When I read about you in the paper...

33:30.635 --> 33:33.888
I really can't thank you enough.
This is just very generous of you.

33:33.971 --> 33:37.934
Oh, it's...
I'm just happy we could... make this work.

33:38.726 --> 33:40.478
A lot of people like to imagine

33:40.561 --> 33:42.355
they could live the way you guys were living.

33:43.981 --> 33:44.982
Um...

33:47.110 --> 33:47.944
Okay.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.321
Thanks, guys. Um...

33:52.990 --> 33:54.367
See you guys in about a week or so.

33:55.952 --> 33:57.161
Tomorrow will be a full day,

33:57.245 --> 33:59.789
so I'll just leave you two to get settled in.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.304
Feels good to be by ourselves again.

34:17.889 --> 34:18.766
It does.

34:28.109 --> 34:29.068
They treat you all right?

34:32.739 --> 34:34.489
It was hard not knowing how you were doing.

34:36.576 --> 34:38.034
I was worried about you too.

34:58.473 --> 35:00.099
Everything's different now.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.438
We can still think our own thoughts.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.114
Come in.

36:03.496 --> 36:04.330
Here.

36:05.915 --> 36:07.083
Your favorite sweater.

36:10.461 --> 36:11.754
There's something on my mind.

36:12.839 --> 36:17.301
They said... a person saw you, and...

36:19.846 --> 36:21.639
that's how they found our camp.

36:24.642 --> 36:26.769
I saw a person,
but I didn't think they saw me.

36:28.604 --> 36:29.605
It was a mistake.

36:32.859 --> 36:34.277
Why didn't you say something?

36:35.736 --> 36:36.737
I was afraid.

36:39.282 --> 36:42.326
I didn't want to leave our camp.
It was such a good one.

36:44.745 --> 36:46.956
Yeah. We stayed there too long.

36:57.466 --> 36:58.968
Are we going to be okay here?

37:04.849 --> 37:06.309
We're going to make the best of it.

37:17.820 --> 37:20.615
We could sleep out here. No one would notice.

37:21.657 --> 37:22.491
Yeah.

37:36.547 --> 37:37.506
Morning.

37:38.049 --> 37:39.926
I didn't mean to interrupt your breakfast.

37:41.594 --> 37:43.638
I was hoping you could help out
with the tree work.

37:44.305 --> 37:45.556
You ever drive a tractor?

37:46.641 --> 37:47.934
You have any work in the stables?

37:49.435 --> 37:52.313
Yeah, but I don't want you
down there just yet.

37:52.396 --> 37:56.400
Those are expensive animals
and... takes some training.

37:56.943 --> 37:58.527
Right now, I need help with the trees.

38:00.446 --> 38:01.697
That's where I make my money.

38:08.829 --> 38:09.664
Swapping out.

38:10.289 --> 38:11.916
Yeah, got about a half dozen more left.

38:15.795 --> 38:18.881
We don't want to send something
like this to a customer in California.

38:18.965 --> 38:20.466
They would not be pleased with that.

38:20.841 --> 38:23.678
It's got a big hole in it.
The top isn't over center.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.515
It's a little wild.
We only want one top in a Christmas tree.

38:28.224 --> 38:29.558
No... Right...

38:31.143 --> 38:32.061
That one.

38:32.770 --> 38:35.064
Right where the line of the tree
meets the leader,

38:35.147 --> 38:36.440
that's where it needs to be cut.

38:50.079 --> 38:54.083
Uh, these are... things that
were donated to our agency.

38:54.750 --> 38:55.668
Got it?

38:56.502 --> 38:57.920
We don't need more things.

38:59.171 --> 39:01.298
Oh, maybe you can find something
you can really use.

39:11.225 --> 39:12.977
How are you guys feeling about this place?

39:13.394 --> 39:15.187
- Good.
- Good.

39:18.566 --> 39:23.237
Oh, I brought you the, um, paperwork
to enroll Tom in school.

39:24.739 --> 39:27.491
Here's the statute
so you can read it and understand it.

39:27.950 --> 39:31.245
Um, I'm going to need that
back signed next time.

39:31.746 --> 39:34.623
And then we can start talking about the DMV.

39:40.854 --> 39:42.481
Don't forget this last...

39:43.841 --> 39:45.217
- Now push it down...
- Don't.

39:49.638 --> 39:50.639
Push forward.

39:52.391 --> 39:53.601
Got ya. That's okay.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.319
Keep pedaling. Ready?

40:03.778 --> 40:05.988
Yeah, but the bike's leaning.

40:06.072 --> 40:08.240
Then you got to counterbalance it
with your weight.

40:11.202 --> 40:12.369
Put your legs into it.

40:13.746 --> 40:14.747
Look where you want to go.

40:22.213 --> 40:23.964
They offer free acupuncture

40:24.048 --> 40:28.844
and just a safe place to come and share
with each other and unload your burden.

40:29.470 --> 40:32.515
With that, at this time,
I'd like to invite you all to just stand,

40:32.598 --> 40:35.893
greet one another, say hello to someone
that you may not have met before.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.900
- Hello.
- How are you doing there?

40:42.983 --> 40:44.026
Wonderful.

40:51.909 --> 40:53.327
All right, you may be seated.

40:56.163 --> 40:58.207
Ah, this morning we have a special...

40:58.749 --> 41:03.712
We have, all the way from Klamath Falls,
For His Glory Dance Troupe

41:03.796 --> 41:08.259
here to celebrate and worship God
through both music and dance.

41:37.246 --> 41:38.247
Good to see you again this morning.

41:38.330 --> 41:39.540
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah.

41:39.623 --> 41:40.875
Hey, guys, how are you?

41:40.958 --> 41:43.669
It was good to see you guys this morning.
You did so good.

41:43.752 --> 41:45.254
Would you like to try the flags?

41:45.921 --> 41:46.797
There you go.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.719
If you take and you cross over,
cross over back and forth...

41:52.595 --> 41:53.971
and go up and down with them...

41:55.139 --> 41:56.765
- See you. All right.
- Kind of a figure eight.

41:57.057 --> 41:59.185
Hi. I'm, I'm Pastor Spencer.
Are you new here?

41:59.768 --> 42:00.811
- New.
- Oh, all right.

42:00.895 --> 42:02.938
It was great having you in this morning.

42:03.022 --> 42:05.441
Um, we'd sure love to have you back.

42:06.525 --> 42:07.610
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

42:07.693 --> 42:08.611
Join us anytime.

42:11.864 --> 42:12.907
- Dad?
- Hmm.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.783
God created frogs.

42:15.951 --> 42:16.785
Yeah?

42:19.163 --> 42:20.039
Did you know that?

42:21.707 --> 42:22.625
Says who?

42:24.251 --> 42:25.294
This pamphlet.

42:26.170 --> 42:27.421
"Considering membership?

42:28.047 --> 42:30.132
There are many ways to participate.

42:30.466 --> 42:32.384
Music, devotional dance,

42:32.927 --> 42:38.140
carpentry, camp, prayer group,
rock and roll, social media."

42:38.557 --> 42:39.683
Is that why we went?

42:41.101 --> 42:44.313
We went because Walters asked us to.

42:45.898 --> 42:47.524
You dress up, you show up on Sunday,

42:47.608 --> 42:49.902
people will believe certain things about you.

42:52.071 --> 42:54.865
Then they don't ask so many questions
about our lives.

42:55.699 --> 42:56.784
Our lives before.

44:06.729 --> 44:07.604
Hello?

44:08.981 --> 44:10.858
- Hey.
- Is this your rabbit?

44:11.233 --> 44:12.609
Yeah, I didn't see her go by.

44:15.696 --> 44:16.613
I'll take her from you.

44:18.198 --> 44:19.450
That's all right, Chainsaw.

44:20.034 --> 44:22.060
Good girl. Thanks.

44:24.405 --> 44:25.372
Yeah.

44:28.334 --> 44:29.293
Uh, hey.

44:30.085 --> 44:32.546
She likes to take off
when I start clipping her nails.

44:33.339 --> 44:34.465
And why would you do that?

44:34.548 --> 44:35.382
For shows.

44:36.258 --> 44:37.551
For 4-H, you know?

44:38.844 --> 44:39.678
FFA?

44:41.305 --> 44:42.639
Future Farmers of America.

44:43.349 --> 44:44.391
Don't know what that is.

44:45.851 --> 44:49.104
Well, it's a club where you learn about
agriculture and animals.

44:50.481 --> 44:53.275
Is that what you want to do in the future?
Be a farmer?

44:53.859 --> 44:54.777
I don't know yet.

44:55.527 --> 44:57.446
I enjoy the clubs and stuff.

45:00.532 --> 45:01.658
You from around here?

45:01.742 --> 45:05.204
No, I just moved in. Over there.

45:07.664 --> 45:09.041
That's going to be my tiny house.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.838
I'll have my kitchen sink about right here.

45:15.339 --> 45:16.423
Window right here.

45:16.507 --> 45:18.509
Be able to look out while I'm doing dishes.

45:18.592 --> 45:19.426
Pretty nice.

45:19.676 --> 45:22.471
And then I'll have a loft,
a little ladder that goes up.

45:22.554 --> 45:23.806
A little sleeping loft.

45:24.807 --> 45:27.059
Maybe even have Chainsaw sleep up there too.

45:27.142 --> 45:28.852
- Are you going to live here?
- Yeah.

45:29.186 --> 45:30.062
Where you going to put it?

45:31.814 --> 45:34.149
Colorado, I was thinking. Maybe Utah.

45:38.987 --> 45:41.448
It's actually Chainsaw's mom right there.

45:45.869 --> 45:46.870
They look alike.

45:50.499 --> 45:51.458
She still alive?

45:52.000 --> 45:53.252
Yeah, she's still alive.

46:06.974 --> 46:08.559
If you want, you can set her down.

46:09.059 --> 46:10.018
There you go.

46:21.155 --> 46:22.573
The ears are soft.

46:23.323 --> 46:24.616
Yeah, that's my favorite part.

46:26.952 --> 46:29.121
If you like rabbits,
you should come to the meeting.

46:29.204 --> 46:30.372
The 4-H meetings.

46:31.582 --> 46:32.749
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

46:49.349 --> 46:50.434
Tom!

46:53.395 --> 46:54.938
Tom!

47:09.161 --> 47:10.454
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:12.748 --> 47:15.751
I met a kid who lives down the road.
We were talking about rabbits.

47:16.460 --> 47:18.962
There was no time to tell you.
It was just happening.

47:26.303 --> 47:28.055
Sorry for making you worry about me.

47:31.016 --> 47:32.684
If we had a phone, I could have called you.

47:32.768 --> 47:35.938
We've always been able to communicate
without all that.

47:44.279 --> 47:47.032
I think it might be easier on us
if we try to adapt.

47:48.575 --> 47:51.828
We're wearing their clothes.
We're in their house. We're...

47:53.664 --> 47:58.085
We're eating their food.
We're doing their work. We have adapted.

47:59.002 --> 48:02.005
The only place we can't be seen
is in this house.

48:03.090 --> 48:04.800
We can still think our own thoughts.

48:06.593 --> 48:07.594
Like you said.

48:19.898 --> 48:22.359
What if the kids at school think I'm strange?

48:23.569 --> 48:25.112
'Cause of the way we were living.

48:31.743 --> 48:33.620
How important are their judgments?

48:40.586 --> 48:41.670
Guess I'll find out.

48:52.806 --> 48:53.932
Take one step back.

48:55.475 --> 48:57.477
Okay. Keep your rabbit tucked in there.

48:58.270 --> 48:59.605
Take one more step forward.

49:01.315 --> 49:02.983
Please return your rabbits to the table.

49:08.363 --> 49:09.323
Very good.

49:13.410 --> 49:14.244
Okay.

49:16.705 --> 49:18.165
Turn your rabbits to face you.

49:20.417 --> 49:24.296
Take your left arm and you'll kind of hold
the rabbit close to you as you lift up.

49:24.379 --> 49:25.797
The other hand on the scruff.

49:27.132 --> 49:27.966
Right.

49:28.925 --> 49:30.886
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

49:31.803 --> 49:34.306
Now you can go ahead
and just slowly set them back down.

49:35.223 --> 49:36.099
Very good.

49:39.394 --> 49:40.646
Start checking the ears.

49:44.316 --> 49:46.735
Okay. And listen to its breathing.

49:49.905 --> 49:52.908
You want to make sure that it sounds
nice and clear, like it's not having,

49:52.991 --> 49:54.910
you know, any congestion or anything, okay?

49:59.247 --> 50:02.918
And a note on self-presentation as well.
Make sure you stand up straight.

50:03.001 --> 50:04.878
Smile, look happy to be here, right?

50:05.671 --> 50:07.547
A little confidence is always good.

50:10.050 --> 50:10.967
Very good, guys.

50:16.390 --> 50:17.766
Hi. Um...

50:19.267 --> 50:22.396
I wanted to drop off some paperwork for you.

50:22.479 --> 50:27.901
Um, here is the date
for your appointment with housing.

50:28.735 --> 50:30.445
And I thought you could use a phone.

50:40.914 --> 50:44.501
It's important for you to follow through
so you guys can remain independent.

50:45.627 --> 50:46.586
Do you understand?

50:47.754 --> 50:48.588
Yes.

50:50.507 --> 50:53.260
Okay, well, um,
I'll be back in a couple weeks.

50:53.343 --> 50:54.970
We can go over that and, um...

50:57.013 --> 50:58.432
All right, I'll see you guys.

51:32.507 --> 51:35.051
Pack your things.
Don't take anything you don't need.

53:23.994 --> 53:25.161
I liked it there.

53:27.706 --> 53:28.707
Did you even try?

53:29.916 --> 53:30.792
I did.

53:32.085 --> 53:32.919
Huh?

53:34.754 --> 53:37.257
Dad, did you? 'Cause I can't tell.

53:38.800 --> 53:41.386
They were going to separate us
if we didn't follow their rules.

53:48.184 --> 53:49.561
Won't they notice we're gone?

53:50.103 --> 53:52.063
Well, if we're lucky, not till tomorrow.

54:03.408 --> 54:04.409
What are you doing here?

54:05.660 --> 54:06.786
Did you bring them with you?

54:08.914 --> 54:11.708
Since you two got burned,
the rangers are here all the time.

54:21.384 --> 54:22.302
Stop!

55:12.644 --> 55:13.603
Let me see.

55:19.317 --> 55:20.276
It's not too deep.

55:21.861 --> 55:22.696
Clean it out.

55:45.593 --> 55:46.761
Why are we doing this?

56:06.156 --> 56:07.532
Dad, we shouldn't be here.

56:11.369 --> 56:14.188
When they start to board, get on.
I'll be in the back.

56:30.889 --> 56:32.766
Good afternoon, welcome aboard.

56:32.849 --> 56:35.477
I would like to, first of all,
assure you that my goal today

56:35.560 --> 56:39.064
is that you have a safe, smooth,
and comfortable ride to your destination.

56:39.147 --> 56:44.152
We will be arriving in Salem next,
and Albany, then Eugene,

56:44.235 --> 56:46.237
and, lastly, the University of Oregon.

56:49.157 --> 56:51.651
Mind if I took a look at your passengers?

56:57.290 --> 56:58.750
Hey. How's it going?

56:59.834 --> 57:00.668
Good.

57:01.377 --> 57:02.545
Are you traveling alone?

57:03.338 --> 57:04.214
Yes.

57:04.839 --> 57:06.132
You have any ID on you?

57:06.216 --> 57:08.093
- No.
- You don't look like an adult.

57:08.176 --> 57:10.178
- I'm... 18.
- You look pretty young.

57:10.261 --> 57:13.056
I'm gonna ask you to step off the bus
so we can look into your situation.

57:13.139 --> 57:14.015
Just grab your bag.

57:14.099 --> 57:15.225
- Get off the bus.
- Come on.

58:03.565 --> 58:04.566
What's wrong?

58:08.778 --> 58:10.280
Dad, no one can see us.

58:23.168 --> 58:25.086
We're pulling into the rest area now.

58:25.170 --> 58:27.213
We'll be here for about ten minutes.
Thank you.

58:38.975 --> 58:40.685
Dad, the bus is about to leave.

58:40.768 --> 58:42.604
We're not getting back on.
We're not getting back on.

58:46.649 --> 58:47.483
Why?

58:53.239 --> 58:54.073
Let me clean it.

59:00.121 --> 59:02.749
What did that woman on the bus ask you?

59:04.042 --> 59:05.084
Nothing.

59:05.752 --> 59:08.296
She barely even noticed me.
She was doing her own thing.

59:17.263 --> 59:18.514
This isn't the way we used to be.

59:19.224 --> 59:20.975
- Have some.
- You hearing me?

59:22.852 --> 59:23.686
Drink it.

59:33.696 --> 59:34.906
Hey, are you going north?

59:34.989 --> 59:37.909
No, sir, I'm not. I'm heading
in the opposite direction.

59:38.326 --> 59:40.453
I can't take that liability, I'm sorry.

59:54.425 --> 59:55.593
We broke down.

59:57.095 --> 59:59.138
- Yeah?
- Can you take us up the road a bit?

01:00:01.307 --> 01:00:03.977
I'm gonna give you a ride,
I need to know a few things.

01:00:04.269 --> 01:00:05.687
Let me talk to the kid a minute.

01:00:10.358 --> 01:00:11.401
Over here.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:15.863
If you're in trouble here,
now would be a good time to tell me.

01:00:15.947 --> 01:00:17.824
My dad and I just really need a ride.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:21.995
Your dad?

01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:30.211
I just need to know
I'm doing the right thing.

01:00:30.295 --> 01:00:31.170
You are.

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:53.860
Not sure why that sheriff was out here.

01:00:54.736 --> 01:00:58.323
Marijuana's legal up here now.
So it's probably not that.

01:00:59.032 --> 01:01:04.620
But then, you got all the, ah...
people who got hooked on pain medication.

01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:09.834
Yeah, it's devastated their lives,
families too.

01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:12.754
Ruined their marriage.

01:01:13.629 --> 01:01:15.840
I'm aware of a few people that have.

01:01:23.473 --> 01:01:25.391
Well, we just crossed into Washington.

01:01:31.064 --> 01:01:32.648
Yeah, anywhere around here.

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:37.278
This is that logging road...

01:01:37.362 --> 01:01:39.072
- Hey.
- ...I was talking about right here.

01:01:42.784 --> 01:01:43.701
Time to get out.

01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:47.663
Good luck to you.

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:48.664
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

01:01:50.666 --> 01:01:52.627
It was good to have your company, you guys.

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.629
- Likewise.
- Bye, Willie Nelson.

01:01:56.089 --> 01:01:57.423
Try and stay dry.

01:01:57.757 --> 01:01:59.550
- Okay, watch your step.
- Willie will miss ya.

01:02:00.176 --> 01:02:01.052
Bye.

01:02:06.516 --> 01:02:07.558
It's cold.

01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:09.519
We're at a higher altitude.

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.320
My fingers are stiff.

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.527
You said there'd be some cabins.

01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:01.112
I really thought there would be.

01:03:06.534 --> 01:03:07.910
My boots are leaking.

01:03:07.994 --> 01:03:09.078
Huh?

01:03:09.162 --> 01:03:10.538
My boots are leaking.

01:03:12.707 --> 01:03:13.833
Do you have extra socks?

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:17.128
Yeah, they're in my bag.

01:03:25.386 --> 01:03:26.220
Don't...

01:03:26.929 --> 01:03:28.014
Keep your gloves on.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.919
What are we going to do? Where are we going?

01:03:58.002 --> 01:03:59.253
We're going to keep moving.

01:04:37.667 --> 01:04:38.876
We've got to move quickly.

01:04:58.896 --> 01:05:00.773
Dad. Dad.

01:05:03.526 --> 01:05:04.694
Can we please sit?

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:06.487
We've got to keep moving.

01:05:08.489 --> 01:05:09.615
Please, can we...

01:05:11.367 --> 01:05:12.285
What?

01:05:12.618 --> 01:05:13.619
I want to sit.

01:05:14.287 --> 01:05:16.372
- No, no, no.
- I can't feel my toes.

01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:18.541
You can't sit down. You can't sit, come on.

01:05:18.624 --> 01:05:20.293
I'm tired. I need to sit.

01:05:58.914 --> 01:05:59.915
Put the knife down.

01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:02.043
- Hey, kiddo. Put the knife...
- I want to help.

01:06:05.087 --> 01:06:06.130
Put the knife down.

01:06:41.916 --> 01:06:43.793
It's gonna keep the heat close to your body.

01:06:51.425 --> 01:06:53.427
Stay with me. Stay with me.

01:07:07.233 --> 01:07:09.610
Dad, are we going to freeze in our sleep?

01:07:12.697 --> 01:07:13.656
No, Tom.

01:07:15.866 --> 01:07:17.034
How do you know?

01:07:52.987 --> 01:07:53.821
Hey.

01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:13.466
Dad.

01:08:14.258 --> 01:08:15.551
Do you think it's empty?

01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:50.836
It tingles.

01:08:54.465 --> 01:08:57.051
That's when the blood starts coming back,
they start warming up.

01:09:13.317 --> 01:09:14.443
How many are there?

01:09:15.236 --> 01:09:16.237
Three.

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:32.002
It's really good.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:39.676
Maybe we could build ourselves
a place like this.

01:09:41.303 --> 01:09:43.721
What about a tiny house in a tree?

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:47.142
You wouldn't need any land for that.
Just one tree.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.479
Yeah.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.064
Do you miss the things we had at the farm?

01:09:57.152 --> 01:09:58.070
Do you?

01:10:00.072 --> 01:10:01.949
They were really never our things.

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:12.835
- Beans. Noodles.
- Noodles.

01:10:19.466 --> 01:10:20.384
Jerky.

01:10:26.098 --> 01:10:27.266
Chocolate.

01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:28.559
Chocolate.

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:37.443
- Can we play chess when you get back?
- Yes.

01:10:46.619 --> 01:10:48.746
Gather kindling before dark.

01:10:50.331 --> 01:10:51.206
Hey.

01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:53.292
Save those matches for the stove.

01:10:59.632 --> 01:11:00.758
I won't be gone long.

01:11:07.848 --> 01:11:09.141
Follow the creek...

01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:11.644
over the ridge.

01:11:13.562 --> 01:11:16.065
- Along there... to here?
- Hmm. Uh-huh.

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:28.661
Hmm...

01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:35.084
- Make sure you drink some water.
- I will.

01:12:32.141 --> 01:12:34.893
"Do you have difficulty enjoying things?"

01:12:38.814 --> 01:12:41.525
"Have you felt distant
or cut off from people?"

01:12:49.116 --> 01:12:52.578
"Are you unable to have sad
or loving feelings?"

01:14:32.636 --> 01:14:33.720
Dad!

01:15:38.202 --> 01:15:39.119
Dad?

01:15:50.631 --> 01:15:51.465
No.

01:16:08.065 --> 01:16:08.899
Can you hear me?

01:16:09.691 --> 01:16:10.901
Dad, can you hear me?

01:17:00.242 --> 01:17:01.576
Hey! Stop!

01:17:05.205 --> 01:17:07.040
I really need your help; my dad is hurt.

01:17:07.124 --> 01:17:08.000
Get in, get in.

01:17:08.083 --> 01:17:09.251
He's by the stream.

01:17:22.472 --> 01:17:23.932
- Hold on.
- Slow.

01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:27.686
Okay.

01:17:40.849 --> 01:17:43.076
- Hi, what's going on?
- We found him up in the woods.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.619
He's in pretty bad shape.

01:17:45.871 --> 01:17:47.122
Okay, one more.

01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:50.876
- Okay.
- And go...

01:17:55.339 --> 01:17:56.506
I don't know. He's...

01:17:57.174 --> 01:17:59.551
- He's got to get to a hospital.
- Can someone from here help?

01:18:00.594 --> 01:18:02.387
- No.
- Can you not call anyone?

01:18:03.138 --> 01:18:04.306
Can you put it down?

01:18:04.723 --> 01:18:06.600
They're gonna treat him
even if you don't have money.

01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:08.477
He just doesn't like to be asked questions.

01:18:09.186 --> 01:18:10.729
Are you in some kind of trouble?

01:18:11.438 --> 01:18:12.981
- No.
- You sure?

01:18:15.567 --> 01:18:16.860
Please, can someone just...

01:18:17.194 --> 01:18:19.154
- Can we just take care of it ourselves?
- Yeah.

01:18:19.613 --> 01:18:20.864
Can we just take care of it ourselves?

01:18:20.947 --> 01:18:23.825
Don't worry. I'm going to take care of it.
It's gonna be okay.

01:18:24.201 --> 01:18:26.161
- Get yourself some water.
- You don't need to call anybody.

01:18:26.787 --> 01:18:27.746
I'll be right back.

01:18:51.325 --> 01:18:54.172
Easy. I bet your head
is about throbbing, isn't it?

01:19:09.538 --> 01:19:11.039
You got any pain?

01:19:17.963 --> 01:19:19.464
All right. Easy. Let me have it.

01:19:20.048 --> 01:19:22.342
I'm going to have to pull this boot off.
It's gonna hurt.

01:19:24.094 --> 01:19:26.555
One, two, three.

01:19:34.796 --> 01:19:36.314
Yeah, you did a number.

01:19:38.066 --> 01:19:39.192
Now you're with me.

01:19:39.985 --> 01:19:41.820
Pain lets you know you ain't dead yet.

01:19:45.073 --> 01:19:46.408
Remember being in the woods?

01:19:50.537 --> 01:19:52.706
You all right? Stay with me.

01:19:53.832 --> 01:19:54.875
Do you know where you are?

01:19:56.376 --> 01:19:58.295
- On a couch.
- Yeah.

01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:00.088
You are on the couch.

01:20:00.505 --> 01:20:01.882
The good news is, brother,

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:05.927
I didn't see any fluid coming out
your nose or your ears.

01:20:07.679 --> 01:20:09.347
But this is going to take some time.

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:13.852
Blane was a medic in the Army,
so he's in good hands.

01:20:15.187 --> 01:20:16.521
Was your dad in the service?

01:20:17.647 --> 01:20:18.565
He was.

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:22.194
What happened out there?

01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:25.530
We got lost.

01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:28.992
Where were you guys headed?

01:20:31.953 --> 01:20:33.872
I don't think we knew where we were going.

01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:39.961
Where do you live? Where's your home?

01:20:41.796 --> 01:20:42.631
With my dad.

01:20:50.889 --> 01:20:53.558
Well, he's splinted and taped up.

01:20:54.434 --> 01:20:56.228
There's a fair amount of soft-tissue damage,

01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:57.854
so that's going to take time to heal.

01:20:58.355 --> 01:20:59.731
That's going to frustrate him.

01:21:01.107 --> 01:21:04.528
It's hard to tell if he may have lost some
function in his toes without an X-ray.

01:21:04.611 --> 01:21:06.947
- Can he walk?
- Yes, he'll be able to walk.

01:21:08.323 --> 01:21:11.243
Those are for the pain,
when he does finally wake up.

01:21:11.326 --> 01:21:12.911
- Thank you.
- Yep, you bet.

01:21:14.579 --> 01:21:17.332
I'll be back to check on him
in the next couple days.

01:21:18.124 --> 01:21:19.459
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:21:29.052 --> 01:21:30.303
Here you are, dear.

01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:38.853
Tom, if your dad is messed up
with something or running from someone,

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:40.939
I really need you to tell me.

01:21:41.523 --> 01:21:44.651
'Cause folks around here aren't looking
to get mixed up in any trouble.

01:21:45.569 --> 01:21:46.987
It's not that kind of trouble.

01:21:53.368 --> 01:21:54.536
Get some rest.

01:21:54.619 --> 01:21:55.453
I will.

01:22:20.145 --> 01:22:21.438
I'm so sorry.

01:22:27.819 --> 01:22:28.653
I know.

01:22:52.594 --> 01:22:53.970
- Paul, how you doing?
- Hi.

01:23:05.273 --> 01:23:11.905
Okay, we got the other RVs on up the hill,
but this one's a little more private.

01:23:13.657 --> 01:23:15.033
We'll be out of your way here.

01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:26.503
If you need anything else,
you know where to find me, okay?

01:23:28.838 --> 01:23:29.673
Thank you.

01:23:31.132 --> 01:23:32.384
We won't be here long.

01:23:35.011 --> 01:23:36.012
It's not a problem.

01:23:50.151 --> 01:23:51.111
I like it.

01:24:22.892 --> 01:24:24.352
Do you know what these boxes are?

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.188
- No.
- They keep bees.

01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:29.190
Have you ever seen inside of a beehive?

01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:31.359
Would you like me to show you?

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.944
Okay, wait right there.

01:24:33.695 --> 01:24:34.863
Let me get something for you.

01:24:44.539 --> 01:24:47.250
When I open this,
the bees are going to come up.

01:24:47.751 --> 01:24:49.461
But they're not coming out to hurt you.

01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:52.839
When a bee stings, it dies.
So they don't want to sting you.

01:24:52.922 --> 01:24:57.427
They want to come up and land on you
and just get to know you.

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:04.517
It's kind of nice to have the trust
of a whole box of creatures

01:25:04.601 --> 01:25:09.272
that have the power to come out
and kill you if they wanted to.

01:25:10.064 --> 01:25:12.776
So it means a lot to me
that I have their trust.

01:25:12.859 --> 01:25:14.444
I've worked hard to get it.

01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:15.361
Hmm.

01:25:19.199 --> 01:25:20.074
Come on.

01:26:11.543 --> 01:26:12.669
I nearly got it.

01:26:14.379 --> 01:26:15.380
Lost it.

01:26:29.352 --> 01:26:31.104
Kind of looks like a seahorse.

01:26:32.063 --> 01:26:32.897
Yeah.

01:26:37.402 --> 01:26:38.695
How's your dad doing?

01:26:38.778 --> 01:26:41.322
He's okay. Trying to get up on the crutches.

01:26:41.406 --> 01:26:43.408
Yeah, I didn't figure
he'd stay down for long.

01:26:44.242 --> 01:26:45.410
He wants to leave.

01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:50.290
I imagine he's trying to find a way
to make it all right.

01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:52.166
Now he feels stuck.

01:26:55.545 --> 01:26:57.881
You know, my friend here, Boris,
has helped me a lot.

01:26:58.506 --> 01:27:00.383
I think your dad would like
having him around.

01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:03.928
He can sense when somebody's restless.

01:27:04.012 --> 01:27:06.639
He can nudge him awake
and help him out of the dreams that way.

01:27:07.223 --> 01:27:08.433
That's what he does for me.

01:27:09.976 --> 01:27:12.478
I wonder if you wouldn't mind
taking him for a few days.

01:27:14.898 --> 01:27:15.732
Hey.

01:27:29.662 --> 01:27:34.626
<i># Kiss me once, oh, kiss me twice #</i>

01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:39.964
<i># Give me a taste of paradise #</i>

01:27:40.673 --> 01:27:46.012
<i># I don't want the blues
Always on my shoulders #</i>

01:27:46.095 --> 01:27:51.017
<i># Get me a cold beer as I get older #</i>

01:27:51.559 --> 01:27:57.023
<i># Oh, my stars, how you undo me... #</i>

01:27:57.565 --> 01:27:58.858
All right. Good seeing you.

01:27:58.942 --> 01:28:00.568
<i># Oh, my stars... #</i>

01:28:01.486 --> 01:28:02.528
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:28:02.612 --> 01:28:05.573
<i># Oh, my stars #</i>

01:28:06.699 --> 01:28:13.706
<i># You undo #</i>

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:15.959
<i># Me #</i>

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:24.050
<i># The sun is going down
And the sky is different colors #</i>

01:28:24.759 --> 01:28:29.931
<i># Baby runs through
All the different hues #</i>

01:28:30.014 --> 01:28:35.520
<i># I feel all right
But these times are bad #</i>

01:28:35.603 --> 01:28:40.733
<i># And I'm alone here
Help me with these blues #</i>

01:28:40.817 --> 01:28:44.487
<i># Oh, my stars, how you... #</i>

01:28:51.536 --> 01:28:52.620
Thank you, dear.

01:29:05.717 --> 01:29:07.093
Dale, this is all I've got.

01:29:07.427 --> 01:29:08.803
Me and Dad, we want to stay.

01:29:10.138 --> 01:29:11.305
Can you take it?

01:29:11.389 --> 01:29:14.058
You're welcome to stay down there
until your dad gets better.

01:29:14.559 --> 01:29:17.812
If you guys were going to be here
a long time, it costs something to stay on

01:29:17.895 --> 01:29:21.441
for water and propane, things like that.

01:29:22.233 --> 01:29:23.151
Is this enough?

01:29:24.027 --> 01:29:25.820
I don't need to take your money right now.

01:29:26.362 --> 01:29:27.739
We want to stay a long time.

01:29:29.449 --> 01:29:30.283
Okay.

01:29:32.410 --> 01:29:34.120
I can take this as a deposit.

01:29:35.747 --> 01:29:38.124
I'm not going to rent the place
out from under you.

01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:39.751
Thank you.

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:43.421
- Will you grab that other bag?
- Dale, I really like living here.

01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:45.590
Hmm.

01:30:02.815 --> 01:30:05.735
I'm looking for the carrots,
the dried carrots.

01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:06.903
What's that for?

01:30:08.196 --> 01:30:11.574
I leave this out for someone
who lives up in the woods.

01:30:13.534 --> 01:30:15.119
I haven't seen him in years.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:19.791
But I know he gets the food
because when I come back,

01:30:19.874 --> 01:30:21.250
the bag is always empty.

01:30:21.334 --> 01:30:22.293
That's a good one.

01:30:22.376 --> 01:30:24.295
Throw some oranges in there, too.

01:30:35.515 --> 01:30:37.266
In the same spot for years.

01:31:08.881 --> 01:31:10.925
Have you ever seen inside a hive before?

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:23.604
It's cool, huh?

01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:26.607
You put your hand over it,

01:31:27.233 --> 01:31:29.443
you can feel the warmth of the hive.

01:31:41.956 --> 01:31:44.667
A person can withstand 500 stings.

01:31:46.627 --> 01:31:47.628
Close your eyes.

01:31:53.217 --> 01:31:54.135
Open.

01:32:06.606 --> 01:32:08.232
See, you don't need to be scared.

01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:30.963
I want to tell you something.

01:32:32.757 --> 01:32:33.966
Please do.

01:32:36.928 --> 01:32:39.639
I paid for this place, so we can stay here.

01:32:41.599 --> 01:32:43.142
Yeah, it's the right thing to do.

01:32:51.359 --> 01:32:52.902
I rented this place...

01:32:54.528 --> 01:32:55.613
so we can live here.

01:33:25.393 --> 01:33:30.481
<i># I'd rather be in some dark holler #</i>

01:33:31.691 --> 01:33:36.612
<i># Where the sun don't ever shine #</i>

01:33:38.114 --> 01:33:40.950
<i># Than to be here alone #</i>

01:33:41.867 --> 01:33:44.537
<i># Knowing that you're gone #</i>

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:48.666
<i># Would cause me to lose my mind #</i>

01:33:50.793 --> 01:33:55.631

01:33:56.674 --> 01:34:01.095
<i># Take me far on down the track #</i>

01:34:03.139 --> 01:34:08.644
<i># I'm going away, I'm leaving today #</i>

01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:13.065
<i># I'm going, but I ain't coming back #</i>

01:34:50.603 --> 01:34:51.645
What are you doing?

01:34:55.399 --> 01:34:58.152
Dad, your leg isn't even healed all the way.

01:34:59.111 --> 01:35:01.072
And it won't... it won't heal right.

01:35:05.701 --> 01:35:06.702
I don't want to leave.

01:35:10.081 --> 01:35:11.832
Last time, you almost died.

01:35:12.875 --> 01:35:14.752
And you would have if I hadn't found you.

01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:17.630
That will never happen again.

01:35:22.176 --> 01:35:24.595
These people,
they're not that different from us.

01:35:24.678 --> 01:35:27.431
Yes, they've been very good to us.
But we have to...

01:35:27.515 --> 01:35:28.432
You!

01:35:32.353 --> 01:35:33.562
You need...

01:35:34.814 --> 01:35:35.689
Not me.

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:47.076
The same thing that's wrong with you
isn't wrong with me.

01:35:50.413 --> 01:35:51.330
I know.

01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:22.254
Dad?

01:38:07.883 --> 01:38:09.843
I know you would stay if you could.

01:41:46.018 --> 01:41:46.894
He had to go.
