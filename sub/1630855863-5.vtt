00:06.000 --> 00:08.800
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.600 --> 00:13.720
Be careful, please.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.000
What's all this stuff?

00:17.760 --> 00:19.520
It's to track the donations.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.880
Everyone can donate
via an app connected to this system.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.360
I know nothing about this.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.160
I'm not surprised.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.480
I said, be careful. That's fragile.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.880
-Hello.
-Oblet. Hello.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.440
Shall we?

00:48.120 --> 00:52.760
All entrances are under surveillance.
Staff members and musicians are vetted.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.000
-All the guests will be searched.
-Good. But stay on guard.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.240
-Diop could show up.
-You think so?

01:01.880 --> 01:04.800
-You should be prepared for anything.
-So I heard.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.200
I'll be in the audience.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.320
-Let me know if there are any issues.
-There won't be any.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.440
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Good evening, sir.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.040
See you later.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.680
We're not done decorating.
You'll have to imagine it.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.680
I can show you how it'll unfold.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.200
A screen will come down
behind the orchestra.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.920
Images will be projected
during the concert, as requested.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.480
The posters you sent me will be
on the front of the theater.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.760
Ms. Pellegrini,
you'll be on the first balcony.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.200
-And the computer equipment?
-On its way.

01:48.560 --> 01:49.640
There it is.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.440
Perfect. Thanks.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.320
-Where will you be sitting?
-Up there.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.360
OK. I'll stand watch by the door.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.320
-Do you think Diop might show up?
-Diop is a showman.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.880
He's thirsty for revenge.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.080
The question isn't whether he'll come…

02:08.520 --> 02:09.360
but when.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.800
Babakar Diop?

02:30.400 --> 02:31.240
Follow me.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.360
I need someone
who gives a good impression.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.560
And who shows up on time. It's important.

02:39.640 --> 02:40.880
Absolutely, sir.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.560
I'm wary of people who show up late.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.320
And those who show up early.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.000
I need someone trustworthy.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.120
Of course. That's a minimum requirement.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.080
This person will be able to trust me
in return.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.160
What's your name?

02:57.240 --> 02:58.840
Babakar, sir.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.040
Babakar Diop.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.680
Babakar, you may go.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.720
Tell my assistant
to put an end to the interviews.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.480
I've found the person I need.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.520
Thank you, sir.

03:19.640 --> 03:23.120
THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE CONCERT

03:27.520 --> 03:28.960
I'm in the hallway.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.160
Entering the office.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.440
There's something on the desk.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.320
Shit.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.760
Looks interesting, huh?

03:49.400 --> 03:50.240
Perfect.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.240
See if you can get something.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.760
OK.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.440
That's nice.

04:02.920 --> 04:03.760
Come on.

04:09.040 --> 04:09.880
"Lu…"

04:11.680 --> 04:14.160
"Lucas…"

04:15.120 --> 04:17.120
"Lucas La…"

04:17.600 --> 04:18.840
"Lucas Lacroix."

04:23.880 --> 04:25.000
Lucas Lacroix.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.680
Hi, Mr. Pellegrini.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.120
Hello.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.440
I've come to update you
on your investments.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.840
Let's make this quick.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.320
Of course, sir.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.320
How are things?

04:44.400 --> 04:45.760
Have you earned me money?

04:46.560 --> 04:48.240
No, but--

04:48.320 --> 04:49.640
Have you lost me money?

04:49.720 --> 04:52.800
-No, but--
-So, what's the point of this meeting?

04:53.680 --> 04:55.680
We make this commitment
to all our clients.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.360
Next time, just send me
my account balance. It'll be quicker.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.280
Very well.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.040
Lucas Lacroix is a wealth manager.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.320
For people with vast fortunes.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.400
He's known for safe investments.
Stable returns.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.640
To do that,
he needs access to his client's data.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.080
The keys to the account. Usernames.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.520
Bank account number,
passwords, login details.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.120
He keeps this data inside a briefcase.

05:32.160 --> 05:35.280
If we want info on Pellegrini,
we need that briefcase.

05:35.840 --> 05:36.960
Great. Good job.

05:37.640 --> 05:38.520
Anytime.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.280
Are you OK?

06:02.600 --> 06:04.920
-Are you OK?
-My briefcase, please.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.160
Hey! Help me get my briefcase back!

06:10.240 --> 06:11.440
-Sir!
-Help me!

06:37.120 --> 06:39.120
-Come on.
-We have what we need?

06:39.920 --> 06:44.320
Dummy company financial statements,
offshore accounts, taxes…

06:44.400 --> 06:46.680
All good. Let's go.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.480
All good! He let go of it.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.480
-Thank you so much.
-It's normal.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.040
Have a nice day, Lucas.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.240
We need help.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.200
What do you mean?

07:08.600 --> 07:09.440
An accomplice.

07:10.760 --> 07:11.600
Yeah.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.520
-This is where you think you'll find them?
-Yeah.

07:15.800 --> 07:16.720
Over there.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.160
They have the finest Lupin editions.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.560
This accomplice is going to come to us.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.000
There are tons of Lupin enthusiasts.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.200
Tons of candidates.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.760
What do you want?

09:01.200 --> 09:02.040
Sorry?

09:03.920 --> 09:05.400
You're pretending to read

09:05.480 --> 09:08.360
and your friend is holding
his book upside down.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.360
So, what do you want?

09:24.360 --> 09:25.200
Here.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.360
Hubert Pellegrini's the target.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.640
The wealthiest man in France.
We'll have to be clever.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.560
-We did our research.
-He can't turn you down.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.360
This man's closely protected.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.680
You must make him think
his strategy is wrong.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.720
Lure him with rewarding investments.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.560
A two-figure return.

09:42.640 --> 09:46.200
-We have confidential information.
-He's obsessed with money.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.920
We know about every deal.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.600
-His stock portfolio.
-He's invested in North Africa.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.560
-Real estate in Asia.
-He's everywhere.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.600
Luxury, beauty products, media,
shipping, energy, telecoms.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.480
The biggest financial centers.
He's distrustful.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.320
-We'll give you a new identity.
-A financial expert.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.120
You'll need to be convincing. Job done.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.440
One now, and another when the job is done.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.400
Works for me.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.320
Up to par on financial markets?

10:15.920 --> 10:17.920
-We can't screw this up.
-We won't.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.160
I don't think
Lupin's ever had such an opponent.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.400
Now you need a name.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.200
-A Lupin reference?
-No, it's too risky.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.880
Something connected to him.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.920
What comes to mind?

10:36.920 --> 10:39.280
Courbet. It's Lupinesque, isn't it?

10:39.360 --> 10:41.680
The Étretat cliffs, Courbet's painting…

10:42.240 --> 10:43.080
Good idea.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.080
That's settled.
Now we need to introduce Courbet.

10:57.000 --> 10:57.880
Hello?

10:57.960 --> 10:59.600
-Yes, Lucas?
-Yes?

10:59.680 --> 11:01.600
Pierre Lafont, from Brussels.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.760
Yes, hello.

11:02.840 --> 11:06.120
We have a report
from the Financial Markets Regulator.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.600
A broker based in Paris is trying
to approach our clients.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.440
An efficient but disreputable method.

11:12.520 --> 11:13.640
Yes, I see.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.080
I wanted to warn you against him.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.400
Yes, hold on…

11:18.480 --> 11:19.880
I'm writing this down.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.840
His name is Philippe Courbet.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.560
-That's all, thank you. Goodbye.
-Yes. Goodbye.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.400
Nice job!

11:35.240 --> 11:36.800
Yes? What is it?

11:37.360 --> 11:39.560
Mr. Pellegrini? This is Mr. Lacroix.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.400
Yes, hello, Lacroix…

11:41.480 --> 11:42.720
Sorry to disturb you.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.040
I've received confidential information

11:45.120 --> 11:46.840
from a colleague in Brussels.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.320
That's fine. Well?

11:48.920 --> 11:52.320
A broker's trying to approach our clients.
Be wary of him.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.000
-And why is that?
-Yes…

11:55.080 --> 11:59.680
He's had some good results,
but his methods are questionable.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.280
Good thing you warned me.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.240
He might try to contact you.
Best to warn you.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.960
-You never know.
-What was his name again?

12:09.600 --> 12:12.440
Yes. Philippe Courbet.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.680
Courbet.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.720
-Like the painter. Thanks, Lacroix.
-OK--

12:49.280 --> 12:53.000
We can optimize your investments
by diversifying your equity portfolio.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.040
I'm listening.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.400
Real estate investments,
assets in North Africa…

12:58.480 --> 13:01.160
That works for a while.
We can do much better.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.120
How do you know about my business?

13:05.280 --> 13:08.040
It's my job to know who I'm dealing with.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.080
Well, part of my job.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.200
And the other part?

13:14.320 --> 13:17.560
The other part is
to make wealthy people even wealthier.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.560
I have some ideas for you.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.040
Which are?

13:23.920 --> 13:27.560
Tell me more
about this concert for your foundation.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.480
This event will draw
different types of people.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.240
-Are you going to get inside as an usher?
-No.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.240
-A stage manager?
-No.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.520
A hairdresser? A violinist?
You can't just go inside.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.280
You are wanted for murder.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.920
Stop panicking.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.960
If we all play our part,
everything will go well.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.720
Nice of you to visit your old man.

13:55.800 --> 13:56.760
This is so nice.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.480
Seriously,
we should have a house like this.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.200
Not just yet.

14:02.280 --> 14:04.640
But in the meantime… Here.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.960
-What's this?
-Open it. It's a present.

14:10.960 --> 14:11.800
You serious?

14:14.120 --> 14:15.840
Dad, how did you manage this?

14:16.360 --> 14:17.880
I got my first paycheck.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.040
It's awesome.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.080
No. Stop…

14:24.160 --> 14:25.240
Just one!

14:25.320 --> 14:26.880
-One picture.
-Give it.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.520
-Let's take a photo together. Stand there.
-OK.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.200
Here it is.

15:03.120 --> 15:03.960
It's all here.

15:05.120 --> 15:05.960
Perfect.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.920
-And your delivery guys?
-It's all good.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.000
I need one more.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.400
I'm ready.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.920
Here. You'll be perfect.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.480
And the box?

15:23.680 --> 15:24.520
It's here.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.640
I said, be careful. It's fragile.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.160
The posters will be projected
on the face of the theater.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.320
You'll be sitting on the first balcony.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.000
And the computer equipment?

16:22.080 --> 16:23.880
There it is. It's right there.

16:24.960 --> 16:25.920
Perfect. Thanks.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.000
What are all these boxes?

16:45.560 --> 16:47.680
The computers to wire the donations.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.640
Why is it taking up so much room?
This isn't the '80s anymore.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.720
It's the hard drives that take up space.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.640
Do you want to check one?

17:02.960 --> 17:03.800
Go ahead.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.000
You want to open another one?

17:14.040 --> 17:16.120
There are 15 more inside the truck.

17:28.520 --> 17:29.520
Fine. Go ahead.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.000
We have a problem. The guy was strangled.

17:43.080 --> 17:46.760
The murderer stepped on the victim's coat
and left a footprint.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.760
It's a size 42 Timberland.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.600
Great. So what?

17:50.680 --> 17:52.040
So, Diop is a 46.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.320
OK. Thank you.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.040
Shit.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.520
We've found a footprint for the murderer.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.360
It doesn't match Diop's.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.160
What's with that face?

18:07.880 --> 18:08.720
What?

18:13.480 --> 18:16.080
Tell me why you framed Babakar,
and we'll forget about it.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.120
-Now do you get it?
-Go to hell.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.800
Last chance, Dumont.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.120
-Dumont.
-Yeah.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.320
-You want to rat me out? OK.
-Dumont.

18:26.200 --> 18:29.680
I took the cash.
But I didn't spend it on watches or coke.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.800
The money was for my kids.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.200
What's going on?

18:38.720 --> 18:40.360
I have a video you need to see.

18:47.120 --> 18:47.960
OK.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.560
Listen. The guy who was murdered
in Diop's place…

18:52.480 --> 18:53.720
The guy from Le Havre.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.960
OK. He had a weapon
registered to this address…

19:00.520 --> 19:03.000
This address is registered to Pellegrini.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.080
His name's Léonard Koné.

19:06.280 --> 19:07.960
Look. His name pops up here.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.600
In Babakar Diop's case.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.640
They were in prison together.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.880
When Diop confessed to
stealing the necklace. And guess what?

19:18.800 --> 19:20.960
Dumont was in charge of the case.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.160
When you arrested Koné at Le Havre,
he wouldn't let you question him.

19:29.760 --> 19:33.000
I'm telling you.
Koné, Pellegrini, Dumont are connected.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.080
Look.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.680
This is Koné at Le Havre.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.800
And this is him in 1995.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.920
He was convicted for attempted murder.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.640
That's why Dumont wanted you off the case.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.880
-You were getting close.
-Yeah.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.760
Remember how he insisted
Pellegrini be released?

19:55.840 --> 19:57.200
This doesn't look good.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.560
The Pellegrini foundation is holding
a concert.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.760
He'll be there.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.400
We have to arrest him. Boss or not.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.680
We're at the Théâtre du Châtelet

20:08.760 --> 20:12.200
for what many are calling
the year's biggest charity event,

20:12.280 --> 20:14.520
with the country's largest fortunes
gathered here.

20:14.600 --> 20:18.280
One individual is drawing
all the attention.

20:18.360 --> 20:23.000
Assane Diop is still on the run
and cannot be located at this time.

20:23.880 --> 20:27.720
Is the man wanted for murder
and for stealing the Queen's necklace

20:27.800 --> 20:31.040
going to show up tonight,
as he did during another event

20:31.120 --> 20:33.280
held by the Pellegrini foundation?

20:36.760 --> 20:37.600
Ready?

20:38.160 --> 20:40.760
Ready.
The musicians will walk on stage soon.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.200
Juliette and her father will be out too.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.840
Pellegrini will be there.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.360
Second balcony. You see?

20:48.880 --> 20:51.360
The computer is ready
to transfer donations

20:51.440 --> 20:52.880
to Pellegrini's account.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.880
This screen shows
how much money is being collected.

21:01.120 --> 21:01.960
OK.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.280
Let's do it.

21:07.520 --> 21:08.480
Hey, buddy.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.760
It's gonna be OK.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.080
Calm and methodical, as usual.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.600
I'm the nervous one. Don't forget.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.000
-See you soon.
-See you.

22:15.640 --> 22:16.720
You look gorgeous.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.400
I'm proud of you.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.240
Everyone's ready whenever you are.

22:26.800 --> 22:27.640
I'm coming.

22:36.120 --> 22:36.960
There he is.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.680
-Come on!
-Sorry. Let's go.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.360
Excuse me. Your invitations, please.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.640
Sorry. Go ahead.

22:54.040 --> 22:58.120
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Juliette Pellegrini.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.680
Thank you. Good evening, all.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.000
It is a great honor for me
to welcome you tonight,

23:20.600 --> 23:22.920
and present you the foundation's work.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
Through your donations,
you could fund scholarships,

23:27.080 --> 23:28.320
cultural activities

23:28.400 --> 23:31.400
for children
who don't normally have access to them.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.440
And tonight,

23:33.520 --> 23:36.840
we have the great privilege
of attending a concert

23:36.920 --> 23:39.840
by the prestigious
French Symphony Orchestra,

23:39.920 --> 23:41.720
conducted by Mathieu Lamboley.

23:41.800 --> 23:46.680
They have accepted to perform for free,
as a show of support for the foundation.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.160
Please applaud them.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.160
You think Diop will show?

24:05.400 --> 24:07.880
Don't know. Half the room is here for him.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.200
Thank you again.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.040
I'm moved to see
that you have answered our call.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.280
-Good evening.
-Evening.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.280
This foundation exists thanks to you.

24:18.360 --> 24:21.160
I know how much
you care about and believe in education.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.000
I'm now appealing to your generosity

24:26.880 --> 24:29.600
by encouraging you to make donations.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.360
An app was created just for this purpose.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.800
All you need to do now
is connect to it and donate.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.000
Donate to your father…

24:39.080 --> 24:41.320
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

24:59.680 --> 25:03.280
PLEASE ENTER AND VALIDATE YOUR DONATION

25:05.720 --> 25:07.560
TOTAL AMOUNT

25:25.000 --> 25:26.800
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

25:40.480 --> 25:44.440
Always the same with you.
You claim the best seat just for yourself.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.240
-What do you want?
-A single word.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.520
The truth.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.120
Don't make me.

25:52.480 --> 25:55.040
-I have nothing to say.
-It's going to hurt.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.120
A shame to get blood on that suit.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.800
I have men everywhere. You won't make it.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.000
Neither will you.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.080
-Quit being polite. We know each other.
-Unfortunately.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.280
Fabienne Bériot.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.720
-You killed her?
-She committed suicide.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.080
Don't lie.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.320
I didn't kill her.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.160
-Léonard did.
-On your orders.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.080
We can't ask him.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.560
Don't fuck with me.
He was working for you.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.480
You made him kidnap my son.

26:23.240 --> 26:26.040
Without harming him.
Children are sacred to me.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.080
It was me you wanted. Not my son.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.600
-See? I'm here.
-Yes, from behind, like a coward.

26:31.680 --> 26:34.760
It's my turn now, man.
What goes around comes around.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.880
You wanted to kill me?

26:38.040 --> 26:39.000
Words!

26:39.720 --> 26:41.200
Speak. The truth.

26:41.280 --> 26:44.200
The truth.
What will you do with the truth?

26:44.880 --> 26:47.800
We're both here together,
but my men will get you.

26:47.880 --> 26:51.000
You'll take the truth to your grave.
It'll be a nice shroud.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.360
Worry about your grave first.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.760
You answer "yes" or "no."
You wanted to kill me?

26:58.400 --> 26:59.520
Of course.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.800
But you screwed up.
You framed me for Léonard's murder.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.000
-You could say that.
-Who killed him?

27:06.360 --> 27:07.960
Pascal Oblet.

27:10.920 --> 27:11.760
Good.

27:11.840 --> 27:12.880
That's good.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.400
And now…

27:15.360 --> 27:16.240
My father.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.720
You framed him. Talk.

27:21.080 --> 27:21.920
Talk!

27:23.280 --> 27:26.360
I hired Babakar
to frame him for the necklace.

27:26.440 --> 27:27.880
-For the insurance money.
-Yes.

27:27.960 --> 27:31.640
-Yes, what?
-Yes, I wanted the insurance money!

27:32.320 --> 27:34.840
Then I sent Léonard to kill your father.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.480
I had no choice.
He never would've let it go.

27:40.560 --> 27:45.040
So, what are you going to do, Assane?
Are you going to go to the police?

27:46.520 --> 27:50.120
No one will believe you.
Just like no one believed your father.

28:11.640 --> 28:12.480
Diop!

28:12.560 --> 28:14.960
Diop is in the building!

28:15.880 --> 28:18.480
Everyone take a floor.
You take the upper level!

28:22.360 --> 28:23.200
It's him!

29:02.280 --> 29:03.880
Hey!

29:21.840 --> 29:22.680
He's there!

29:42.520 --> 29:44.000
Don't move or I'll shoot!

29:47.680 --> 29:50.240
OK. You win. I surrender.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.040
-Don't move.
-Just so you know…

29:56.400 --> 29:59.160
Your trigger safety is on. I'll remove it.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.720
Keep that thing pointed at me. No worries.
It's fine.

30:04.800 --> 30:05.760
Can I remove it?

30:06.800 --> 30:07.800
Easy. Look.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.080
It's off.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.000
Dammit! Fuck!

30:16.080 --> 30:17.040
Come on!

30:22.800 --> 30:23.640
Sorry.

30:45.280 --> 30:46.120
Diop!

30:46.600 --> 30:47.440
Come on!

31:27.520 --> 31:28.840
Go around!

31:38.920 --> 31:40.320
HE'S INSIDE

32:13.440 --> 32:15.320
Diop is inside. Find him.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.400
Emergency response team. Come on!

32:17.480 --> 32:19.040
Go!

32:19.120 --> 32:21.080
-Let's go, guys!
-All together!

34:06.040 --> 34:07.160
Stop or I'll shoot!

34:15.080 --> 34:16.520
Lower your weapon, Dumont.

34:17.160 --> 34:18.800
-What?
-We know everything.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.080
Come on!

34:22.720 --> 34:23.880
Come on!

34:28.240 --> 34:29.280
Don't move, Diop!

34:31.360 --> 34:32.200
Let him go.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.440
You're under arrest for corruption,
influence peddling.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.240
What? He's our target!

35:09.080 --> 35:10.760
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

35:11.800 --> 35:12.720
Juliette.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.880
Sorry to spoil the party. I had no choice.

35:16.600 --> 35:17.760
You all need to know.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.160
Babakar Diop, my father,
never stole that necklace.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.440
Approaching target.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.800
Hubert Pellegrini falsely accused him.

35:25.880 --> 35:26.720
Even worse…

35:27.480 --> 35:28.960
Wait for my order.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.400
He ordered to have him killed.
Fabienne Bériot too.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.800
He even kidnapped my son.

35:37.080 --> 35:37.920
Ready.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.560
Juliette, you need to know this.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.120
We're ready.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.280
He stole from you.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.160
The money was embezzled.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.440
Let's go!

35:47.520 --> 35:49.480
Don't move. You're under arrest.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.680
Curtain.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.200
BEGIN TRANSFER

36:09.480 --> 36:13.120
Ladies and gentlemen, please do not rush.

36:13.920 --> 36:18.080
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm.

36:33.600 --> 36:34.680
UNLOCKED

36:57.480 --> 36:58.320
Here.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.880
It's yours. As promised.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.800
Do you have lots like this?

37:07.880 --> 37:09.000
It's the last one.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.120
I have one question.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.560
Why give Pellegrini all that money?

37:16.800 --> 37:18.400
9 million euros.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.080
Yes. But that account isn't Pellegrini's.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.960
-Is it Assane's?
-No.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.080
The foundation's.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.640
Aren't we waiting for Assane?

37:33.720 --> 37:36.040
Don't worry. He'll figure it out.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.800
FIRE PROTECTION

38:00.920 --> 38:02.920
Excuse me?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.320
The guy you're after… He's on the roof.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.880
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.320
-OK. Let's go.
-Get him.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.320
Go on. Yeah.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.360
Get him.

38:14.160 --> 38:18.560
All units. Diop is heading for the roof.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.240
All units. Diop is on the roof.

38:23.320 --> 38:25.120
Théâtre du Châtelet. Evacuate.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.320
Let's go.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.040
VOICE MESSAGE

38:31.160 --> 38:34.320
My father. You framed him. Talk.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.560
I hired Babakar
to frame him for the necklace.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.520
-For the insurance money?
-Yes.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.360
-Yes, what?
-Yes, I wanted the insurance money!

38:46.240 --> 38:47.080
What?

38:48.600 --> 38:51.920
Ladies and gentlemen,
please head to the emergency exits.

38:52.000 --> 38:52.840
No rushing.

38:52.920 --> 38:55.920
Yeah. I think he's up on the roof.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.520
-Sixth floor. I saw him.
-Thank you.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.800
He's not getting out.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.000
Hey, guys.

39:38.440 --> 39:39.760
-Come.
-What is it?

39:53.920 --> 39:54.920
Dammit, it's him!

39:56.320 --> 39:57.400
Come on!

39:59.760 --> 40:01.120
Hurry up!

40:03.600 --> 40:04.520
Come on!

40:06.120 --> 40:08.240
Stop!

40:09.120 --> 40:11.000
Come on, guys! Get him!

40:22.600 --> 40:24.000
Stop!

40:27.440 --> 40:29.000
Come on.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.080
Let's go!

40:42.480 --> 40:44.080
Shit! He's getting away!

40:48.040 --> 40:51.920
He's the greatest burglar

40:53.640 --> 40:57.080
Yes, but he's a gentleman

40:59.360 --> 41:03.160
He'll take what matters to you

41:04.720 --> 41:08.680
Without using a weapon

41:10.040 --> 41:13.280
When he robs a woman

41:15.600 --> 41:19.160
He gives her flowers

41:21.080 --> 41:25.680
The gentleman burglar

41:26.600 --> 41:30.000
Is a noble man

41:31.200 --> 41:36.640
He shows up at night
But won't disturb your sleep

41:36.720 --> 41:42.200
He will quietly unhook the painting
You bought the day before

41:42.280 --> 41:44.320
Before he goes

41:44.400 --> 41:47.080
Once he's done with his guilty deeds

41:48.520 --> 41:52.200
He'll leave a note on the piano

41:54.280 --> 41:55.120
The date.

41:56.120 --> 41:56.960
I forgot.

41:58.280 --> 42:01.280
Marius Jacob was born
on September 29, 1879.

42:01.360 --> 42:02.720
We just went over this.

42:04.960 --> 42:05.800
What's that?

42:10.360 --> 42:11.200
It's not here.

42:15.080 --> 42:15.920
In your room.

42:16.440 --> 42:17.520
Are you sure?

42:21.640 --> 42:22.760
What is this thing?

42:23.440 --> 42:24.760
Has to be your father.

42:26.400 --> 42:27.240
Not here.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.280
You stole from the Musée d'Orsay.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.600
You can steal a bracelet from your ex.

42:50.120 --> 42:50.960
Got it.

42:55.480 --> 42:56.400
Hang on.

42:56.960 --> 42:58.880
I don't know how to turn it off.

43:02.160 --> 43:04.160
"Raoul's bridge?" What's that?

43:06.000 --> 43:10.360
The bridge where your father and I decided
to name you Raoul.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.960
Awesome. Let's go.

43:12.040 --> 43:13.480
No. Out of the question.

43:13.960 --> 43:16.440
Why?
Dad's asking us to meet him. Let's go.

43:16.520 --> 43:18.080
No, we're not going.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.520
I'm going.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.080
Raoul, wait!

43:24.680 --> 43:28.640
Mr. Pellegrini, you're under arrest
for abducting Raoul Diop,

43:28.720 --> 43:31.680
and the murder of Fabienne Bériot
and Babakar Diop.

44:11.520 --> 44:12.400
10:00 p.m.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.560
Where is he?

44:22.320 --> 44:23.160
You hear that?

44:26.080 --> 44:27.040
Look!

44:28.400 --> 44:29.240
Dad!

44:53.960 --> 44:54.800
Raoul!

44:55.960 --> 44:56.800
Dad!

45:02.000 --> 45:04.240
It's good you came. Both of you.

45:08.480 --> 45:09.480
Is this it?

45:10.040 --> 45:11.040
Is it over?

45:11.120 --> 45:13.040
Yeah. It's over.

45:15.480 --> 45:16.440
But you were right.

45:16.520 --> 45:19.560
-I'm causing you problems.
-We don't give a damn about that.

45:19.640 --> 45:21.320
I only ever think of myself.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.640
I have to go. Far away from you.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.720
We don't want to lose you.
That's all that matters.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.120
I'll be back.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.200
When?

45:37.120 --> 45:37.960
Don't worry.

45:39.480 --> 45:42.280
You won't see me,
but I'll be watching over you.

45:43.720 --> 45:45.280
You take care. All right?

45:48.360 --> 45:49.200
You too.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.120
I love you both.
