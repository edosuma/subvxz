00:02.160 --> 00:03.810
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.000 --> 00:06.128
- Silas.
- Hello, my shadow self.

00:07.480 --> 00:10.768
Every time I close my eyes,
I can feel myself drowning...

00:10.960 --> 00:12.450
and I need to make it stop.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.320
<i>- After</i> months of heartache and pain...
- Bonnie's dead.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.920
<i>...we still held on to hope.</i>

00:17.960 --> 00:20.406
I wanna use Silas' death
to bring Bonnie back.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.404
- I can feel you.
- Bonnie?

00:22.600 --> 00:24.967
It worked. I'm back.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.003
<i>But our victories came at a cost.</i>

00:27.200 --> 00:31.489
My hair is gray, my teeth are falling out. Not
sure what that suggests, but it's not health.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.286
You're aging, Katherine.
You have a few months.

00:34.480 --> 00:38.644
Every supernatural being that passes over
to the Other Side will pass through you.

00:38.840 --> 00:42.083
- That's gonna hurt like a bitch.
- And new threats are about <i>to</i> rise.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.965
The good news about having vampire blood
in your system...

00:45.160 --> 00:48.209
is that's step one to creating a vampire.
This is step two.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.721
Preliminary report, subject 62547.

01:01.320 --> 01:07.043
Subject has transformed from human
to vampire in approximately 14 days.

01:22.240 --> 01:25.164
Indicators predict a positive response...

01:25.360 --> 01:29.410
to first bag of
undiluted Augustine blood.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.047
Physical strength
is an unforeseen side effect.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.924
Terminating transfusion.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.042
Activating emergency procedures.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.047
Hi, Mom, I know we haven't seen each other
or talked in a while.

02:13.240 --> 02:18.565
So I wanted to make you a video update. I
finally finished my whirlwind summer tour.

02:18.760 --> 02:22.367
Got a new 'do, and I'm in college.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.244
At Whitmore, where Grams taught.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.525
And this is my dorm. It's huge, right?

02:28.720 --> 02:31.929
Look, it even has a fireplace.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.088
I mean, what dorm has a fireplace?

02:34.280 --> 02:36.408
Oh, here they are.
Hey guys, say hi to my mom.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.080
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

02:39.280 --> 02:44.047
They're planning me a welcome party,
just something low key.

02:44.240 --> 02:48.928
I miss you, please come visit
when you get a chance.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.203
I'll, um, talk to you soon.
Mwah. Bye.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.171
And by the way, Mom,
I'm not a witch anymore.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.323
I died and came back from the Other Side.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.490
Yeah, I'm the supernatural anchor
that connects our two worlds.

03:02.680 --> 03:07.447
Technically, I'm a ghost
that people can still see and touch so...

03:07.640 --> 03:12.931
Okay. So I left out a detail. Or two.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.451
I'll explain when she visits.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.166
How big is this party going to be?

03:17.360 --> 03:22.321
Well, let's see. Silas and Tessa
are gone and you finally aren't...

03:22.520 --> 03:25.649
Which equals a massive cause
for celebration.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.571
Which equals a massive party.

03:28.760 --> 03:33.800
Hopefully, since each of us have only
made one friend in college so far.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.049
And given that mine went radio silent
after he kissed me...

03:37.240 --> 03:41.848
and yours was last seen at a tea party
for a vampire-hating secret society.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.171
Augustine? The one who covered up
your roommate's death...

03:45.360 --> 03:47.089
and wants to kick you off campus?

03:47.280 --> 03:51.569
What? I've kept up. The Other Side is
boring, what else am I supposed to do?

03:52.200 --> 03:55.966
All right, so Augustine wants us gone.
Who cares? It doesn't matter.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.323
It's not gonna happen.
We're moving on with our lives, together.

03:59.520 --> 04:04.606
As functional vampires.
A former-witch anchor thing. I don't know.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.286
And we're having a party.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.209
With Jell-O shots.

04:11.360 --> 04:16.399
Oh, shoot.
Um, I have to go register for classes.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.839
What?

04:20.040 --> 04:21.087
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.243
Have fun registering.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.045
Oh, my God.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.404
Oh, my God.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.161
Wait, registering for classes?

04:38.360 --> 04:41.011
I know. She's...
I know I have Elena's blessing.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.965
I don't need to rub it in her face day one
in the dorm room.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.731
We could always sneak back to my place.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.046
You mean Damon's house?

04:48.240 --> 04:50.368
Why don't we just have sex in his bathtub?

04:50.600 --> 04:52.602
Or maybe Katherine could watch.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.089
This hair, by the way. Kind of hot.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.090
- Are you okay?
- Yep.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.408
I gotta go to class. See you tonight?

05:19.600 --> 05:20.647
- Yeah.
- Okay. Mwah.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.131
I'm ready.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.801
Okay, I know this is
gonna sound lame, but...

05:55.040 --> 05:58.283
Anytime you start with
"it's lame," guess what, it is.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.451
This is for Bonnie. And you had
a really big part in bringing her back.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.803
So I think that you should come.
Oh, wait. Hang on. Wait.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.844
Hey! Aaron, hey.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.444
- Hey.
- Long time, no see.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.331
- Here, you're coming.
- Who's Aaron?

06:17.160 --> 06:20.767
- Party in a dorm. No thanks.
- I know what you're doing.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.123
- You push people away. Thing is...
- How do you know that about me?

06:24.360 --> 06:26.567
Because you told me at the costume ball.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.363
When I compelled it out of you.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.291
Okay, forget that I said that.
Forget that I know anything.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.403
Starting over. You're coming to my party.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.490
There'll be free beer
and it will be really good for you.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.682
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.889
That was an embarrassingly close call.
Maybe I should be there...

06:45.080 --> 06:48.687
so you don't spill our secrets
and make out with the moody mystery guy.

06:48.920 --> 06:52.003
The only moody mystery guy
that I wanna make outwith is you.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.487
Oh, and speaking of which, invite Stefan.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.690
Speaking of moody or making out?
Either way, he'll never show.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.963
His memory's back
and he remembers he hates us.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.686
Just try, okay? I bought bourbon.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.884
So he can just get drunk
and hate us from afar.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.084
Well, I'll be sure to relay the message.

07:12.320 --> 07:16.245
So apparently, we've been invited
to a college party.

07:17.360 --> 07:20.204
Yeah, that was my first reaction too.

07:21.080 --> 07:24.607
Then Elena promised a bottomless well
of top-shelf alcohol.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.609
<i>Ste'? an .</i>

07:40.640 --> 07:42.722
You Okay?

07:43.440 --> 07:47.001
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- How about my favorite reading chair?

07:57.160 --> 08:01.245
Tell Elena thanks,
but I'm not really up for a party tonight.

08:09.240 --> 08:13.609
How about it, Matt? Matty Blue-Blue.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.571
I want another drink!

08:15.800 --> 08:18.644
No. You're drunk and scaring the customers.

08:20.760 --> 08:24.765
You realize that every single time you
say no, it just makes you hotter, right?

08:27.280 --> 08:31.001
What are you watching?
Some Czech reality show?

08:31.280 --> 08:32.645
How'd you know it was Czech?

08:33.600 --> 08:36.967
Eye contact. We're getting started.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.125
You translate, you drink.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.443
Okay.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.369
What the hell am I looking at here?

08:43.559 --> 08:45.528
So over the summer, I went to Prague.

08:45.760 --> 08:49.526
Met a girl, and she followed me back here.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.800
And then her boyfriend put
some spirit thing in my head.

08:55.520 --> 08:59.081
- Oh, dear, this is bad.
- Why?

08:59.280 --> 09:04.127
<i>My friends will come looking
for this blade. Protect it at all costs.</i>

09:07.280 --> 09:13.287
- Some guy named Kristof. He activated you.
- What do you mean activated me?

09:13.480 --> 09:17.087
He's a Traveler.
Travelers are a faction of witches.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.129
They're big on spirit possession.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.688
You've got one inside of you.
It's kind of like a human parasite...

09:22.880 --> 09:26.202
- ...hitching a ride in your brain.
- How the hell do I get it out of me?

09:26.400 --> 09:32.169
That girl that followed you back from
Prague, was she, I don't know, feisty?

09:32.360 --> 09:36.729
Little accent? Ridiculously beautiful?

09:37.600 --> 09:40.171
Pretty much, yeah. Her name was Nadia.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.160
Why? Do you know her?

09:45.920 --> 09:48.048
You could say that. Ahem.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.129
I handed out all the fliers.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.284
Oh, and Damon said that
he's gonna try and bring Stefan.

09:54.480 --> 09:57.768
Funny, that seemed to imply that Damon
is actually coming.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.130
Hmm...

10:04.640 --> 10:09.931
Maybe a call from a mysteriously
hot biology TA will help.

10:15.640 --> 10:18.211
Well, look who rose from the dead.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.161
I need your help.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.805
- What happened, Jesse?
- Just come to my room please.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.163
- Okay, I'm coming. But what's going on?
<i>- It's</i> a long story.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.681
My roommate's gonna be home.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.087
<i>Yo, Jesse.</i>

10:46.080 --> 10:47.923
Jess, you home?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.526
I'm sorry, man.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.450
Oh, my God.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.082
Who the hell turned you into a vampire?

11:13.440 --> 11:17.923
It was torture. I was in some cell all day
and then at night he'd take me out...

11:18.160 --> 11:20.970
- ...and do experiments on me.
- What kind of experiments?

11:21.240 --> 11:25.211
I don't know. He'd starve me
and then inject me with some weird blood.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.604
What am I supposed to tell my parents?
They left me messages.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.609
They're wondering where the hell I am.

11:30.800 --> 11:35.328
We're going to call them and tell them
that you lost your phone but you're okay.

11:37.120 --> 11:41.250
- Where's Wes now?
- I locked him in his lab after I attacked him.

11:41.440 --> 11:45.923
Honestly, the whole escape was kind of a blur.
I wasn't exactly in my right mind.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.010
Well, you're new and you're hungry.

11:49.240 --> 11:53.484
Not for long. I brought our stash.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.447
How are you doing?

11:56.640 --> 11:59.962
Our stash? You're a vampire too?

12:00.640 --> 12:02.290
You say it like it's a bad thing.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.609
First rule of being a vampire
is realizing how awesome you are.

12:15.160 --> 12:19.006
- How's he doing?
- He's all right. He's alive.

12:20.480 --> 12:24.280
Elena, wait.
I was thinking that Jesse could do it.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.480
You're a vampire now.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.570
You may have hurt him,
but you can also heal him.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.689
With your blood.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.362
Holy crap, that's insane.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.490
You wanna teach him about compulsion?

13:03.880 --> 13:05.484
Hey, stranger.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.044
Look what I stole.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.367
- Knock yourself out.
- Hey, come on.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.845
Please just have one drink with me. Please.

13:15.040 --> 13:19.170
Stefan, I have had a bad year, really.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.006
And it would be nice to
have a friendly face.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.841
- One pity drink.
- See, the universe at work.

13:30.040 --> 13:35.206
I don't know if you knew this, but our
doppelganger stars are fated to be together.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.246
So like it or not, you're gonna end up
with somebody who looks like me.

13:39.440 --> 13:44.048
Although, the universe seems to have
all of its eggs in the Elena basket.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.562
But at this point, I don't really blame it.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.043
What is wrong with you?

13:53.240 --> 13:56.210
Other than the joint pain, receding gums...

13:56.400 --> 14:00.564
and the fact that I have to pee
every five minutes, I'm dandy.

14:00.760 --> 14:07.450
But hey, enough about me,
why are you all by your lonesome?

14:09.080 --> 14:11.651
So I could avoid talking to anyone.

14:13.120 --> 14:18.126
Well, if you did want to talk to someone,
I'm right here.

14:18.760 --> 14:24.449
And let's be honest, I'm wasted.
So I'm not gonna remember.

14:28.440 --> 14:32.923
Look, I thought that killing Silas would allow
me to move on with my life, but I was wrong.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.770
I spent my summer locked in a safe.

14:34.960 --> 14:38.043
One minute I'm fine, the next minute,
I feel like I'm dying again.

14:38.240 --> 14:44.009
Oh, classic PTSD.
You survived a pretty traumatic event.

14:44.240 --> 14:47.289
And now you're back
and you've got nothing but free time...

14:47.480 --> 14:51.201
to just relive that terrible experience
in the safe.

14:51.440 --> 14:55.968
Well, allow me to give your life a purpose.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.769
Help me with one little favor.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.287
Should have known this was gonna
come around to you needing something.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.766
I'm just trying to help.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.446
What would I know
about post-traumatic stress?

15:05.640 --> 15:09.804
I only had my newborn ripped from my arms
by my judgmental father...

15:10.000 --> 15:12.924
and then had to run 500 years
after my entire family...

15:13.120 --> 15:15.646
had been slaughtered by a psychopath.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.128
But hey, that didn't have
any lingering side effects.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.482
Hey, all right. All right.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.971
All right, what do you need?

15:26.160 --> 15:29.960
I thought you never wanted to see me again.
Why'd you call me?

15:31.480 --> 15:37.362
Stefan, I'd like you to meet Nadia Petrova.
My daughter.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.645
So your mom's like me too?

15:46.880 --> 15:53.047
Yeah, yeah. Long story, she's surviving fine.
You'll be great.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.762
Your eyes keep scanning the room.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.129
You afraid I'm gonna go vampire postal
on the fourth floor freshmen?

15:59.320 --> 16:03.564
No. I'm sorry. I'm just
looking for my, um...

16:06.600 --> 16:08.364
I'm not sure what he is, actually.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.403
Boyfriend?

16:10.840 --> 16:12.171
Friend with benefits?

16:12.400 --> 16:16.166
He's my best friend's little brother.
He's still in high school.

16:16.360 --> 16:20.729
And I think I'm madly in love with him.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.210
- Have you been keeping an eye on Jesse?
- Yep.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.768
Teaching him the art of sublimating
vampire hunger via grain alcohol.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.248
And I sent Damon to question Wes.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.603
You realize that Damon's
going to kill Wes, right?

16:45.520 --> 16:48.729
He's not going to kill him.
He's getting information.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.400
You realize that you're wrong, right?

16:51.600 --> 16:55.525
Okay, look, I know that you're not crazy
about Damon and I being together.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.883
No, no, it's fine.
I'm fine with you two being together...

16:59.120 --> 17:02.920
as long as you can acknowledge
the kind of person you are together with.

17:06.599 --> 17:07.726
What do you want?

17:07.960 --> 17:11.009
What I want is to be drinking
copious quantities of booze...

17:11.200 --> 17:14.602
and making out with my girlfriend,
but, unfortunately, I can't until...

17:14.839 --> 17:17.570
I get a bunch of answers out of you.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.211
- Whoa.
- Careful with those.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.926
These? These right here? Why?

17:23.119 --> 17:25.771
We're on a college campus, right?
Full of students?

17:25.960 --> 17:29.601
I can't imagine an MD has a bunch
of infectious diseases just lying around.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.804
MD PhD. I'm a researcher.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.761
Well, that explains it.
I've met a lot of people like you.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.566
Science over medicine, right? Let me guess.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.651
You use these on your little
vampire lab rats, don't you?

17:44.480 --> 17:47.165
Not in the mood to talk? Fair enough.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.806
We're gonna play a little game
where I inject you...

17:51.080 --> 17:55.563
with whatever the hell
necrotizing fasciitis is.

17:55.800 --> 17:59.691
- It's a flesh-eating bacteria.
- Gross.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.609
So I'm gonna do that.
And I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.290
You answer me correctly...

18:05.520 --> 18:10.651
I'm gonna give you some of my delicious
vampire blood...

18:10.840 --> 18:12.410
and it'll heal you right on up.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.204
If you don't answer me correctly...

18:14.480 --> 18:18.371
we're just gonna have to see
how much flesh these little guys can eat.

18:25.800 --> 18:30.089
Just out of morbid curiosity,
which one of you is younger?

18:30.320 --> 18:32.004
I am.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.890
Right.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.843
Okay, so here's the knife
the Traveler left behind with me.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.203
- Now what are we doing in here?
- Take a seat, Matt.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.011
This is ridiculous.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.890
- What the hell was that?
- She's calling on Matt's passenger.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.522
Easy, easy, easy.

19:14.920 --> 19:19.528
Hello, Gregor. I'm Nadia's mother.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

19:20.400 --> 19:25.645
- What do you want?
- Here's the thing. Nadia's my only child.

19:25.880 --> 19:29.441
So, naturally, I'm suspicious of anyone
who wants to date her.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.931
Tell us the real reason
why you're in Mystic Falls.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.122
To track and kill Silas.

19:36.360 --> 19:37.407
Oh.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.365
So it has absolutely
nothing to do with this?

19:41.360 --> 19:42.407
How did you get that?

19:43.400 --> 19:46.563
I would rather be getting drunk,
so why don't you stop wasting time...

19:46.760 --> 19:49.081
and tell us what you're doing here?

19:51.280 --> 19:56.127
Fine. After Silas was dead,
I was meant to kill her.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.922
I didn't see that one coming.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.248
You were using me to get to her?

20:03.280 --> 20:06.807
Why? Why would you kill her?

20:07.000 --> 20:11.369
That's what the Travelers want.
I don't question my orders.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.683
See why I don't want you dating my daughter?
Because Travelers...

20:14.920 --> 20:18.766
are ruthless, manipulative hypocrites.

20:18.960 --> 20:23.124
I know because her grandfather was one.

20:30.480 --> 20:34.326
- What did you just do?
- Give it a rest. Matt will be fine.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.522
Gregor, on the other hand, not so much.

20:36.760 --> 20:42.802
I just expelled his spirit. There's a
reason why he wanted this knife so badly.

20:43.920 --> 20:48.005
It's the only thing
that will truly kill a passenger.

20:52.720 --> 20:57.726
Turning a kid into a vampire
so you can experiment on him? Harsh.

20:57.960 --> 21:02.807
What is it about this place
that turns people into mad scientists?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.651
Human trials are a vital part
of modern medicine.

21:05.840 --> 21:09.162
Yeah, but don't people usually volunteer
or sign waivers?

21:09.360 --> 21:12.045
Maybe get some dough for tuition?

21:12.240 --> 21:14.368
You do what's necessary
for the greater good.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.530
I'm not the greatest guy in the world...

21:17.720 --> 21:21.247
but sounds like some Mengele-level crap
that you're spouting out.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.164
So I gotta ask...

21:23.960 --> 21:26.008
what is your greater good?

21:29.480 --> 21:30.606
Rabies.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.366
Sounds fun, doesn't it?

21:32.600 --> 21:34.568
And appropriate, given the circumstance.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.361
Are you doing okay?

22:07.560 --> 22:10.484
Am I on the famous Other Side?

22:11.200 --> 22:12.531
You are.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.571
What, um...?

22:16.640 --> 22:18.005
What got you here?

22:18.200 --> 22:19.611
I died.

22:19.800 --> 22:23.009
No, I mean, what were you?

22:23.200 --> 22:25.282
A Witch.

22:25.880 --> 22:26.927
What are you?

22:27.120 --> 22:29.771
The anchor to the Other Side.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.731
Every supernatural being who dies
passes through me.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.924
That doesn't seem like
it'd be a lot of fun for you.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.650
It's better than being dead.

22:38.560 --> 22:39.766
I'm so sorry.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.930
- That's such a stupid thing to say.
- Ha-ha-ha.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.248
It's okay, honey.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.807
Dying wasn't fun.

22:48.040 --> 22:51.328
But then, you felt my pain,
so I guess you know that.

22:51.560 --> 22:52.846
I'm sorry.

22:53.920 --> 22:57.686
But you know what, the pain is gone now.

22:59.120 --> 23:03.284
And seeing a friendly face over here
certainly doesn't hurt.

23:09.920 --> 23:14.130
Sorry. Pretty much had to wrestle Elena
to get her to give me these.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.770
You Okay?

23:18.280 --> 23:21.489
- Yeah, I think I am.
- Good.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.882
Then I'm gonna need you to come with me.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.281
Where are we going?

23:26.160 --> 23:28.003
To register for classes.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.600
That feels amazing.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.531
That's one of the other fun side effects.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.368
Everything is heightened.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.971
So that feeling never goes away?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.364
Nope.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.322
Well, rabies was a bust.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.361
Guess I'll have to find something
more immediate.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.321
I wanted to turn Jesse
into a new kind of vampire.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.727
Well, that's awfully ambitious of you.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.001
I'm awfully smart.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.845
Ebola.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.646
Why?

24:23.720 --> 24:26.849
Your kind is dangerous to humans
because we're your food source.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.690
I wanna change that.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.246
What?

24:36.840 --> 24:39.650
Last time I kissed you,
you got weird, and it was awkward.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.367
If vampires don't need to feed on humans,
they're no longer a threat.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.961
Well, I'm not buying the good doctor bit.

24:49.200 --> 24:52.409
Human blood will only satiate Jesse
temporarily...

24:52.640 --> 24:54.927
until he gets a taste
of what he really craves.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.208
Well, what exactly does he really crave?

25:05.480 --> 25:06.606
Ow.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.450
You bit me. Heh.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.566
<i>Hey-</i>

25:17.280 --> 25:20.090
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just gotta get out of here.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.566
Jesse.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.963
Okay, so this isn't the lamest party
that I've ever been to.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.810
Aaron, hey, you made it.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.162
Barely. I think I fell asleep.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.691
I just woke up.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.207
Weird.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.681
Well, this will make it better.

25:53.040 --> 25:56.362
Oh, now I know why
Wes told me to stay away from you.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.085
Cheers.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.647
You're trouble.

26:05.400 --> 26:08.609
So, hey, um, how do you
know Wes, anyway?

26:08.800 --> 26:09.961
He's my legal guardian.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.525
Really?

26:12.040 --> 26:14.327
- What about your parents?
- Dead.

26:14.520 --> 26:15.681
Mine too.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.161
Birth and adopted.

26:18.560 --> 26:19.800
Whoa, dark.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.810
No offense, but usually I'm the
biggest freak in the room.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.210
So how did it happen?

26:34.600 --> 26:39.845
Uh, our car went over a bridge.
I lived, they didn't.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.521
You?

26:41.720 --> 26:43.210
I was 6.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.124
And we went camping.

26:46.360 --> 26:49.364
And I woke up
to the sound of my morn screaming.

26:49.880 --> 26:54.647
I went to check it out,
and I saw blood everywhere.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.049
They had bite marks all over their neck.

26:59.360 --> 27:02.762
- Bite marks?
- Yeah, they said a bear got into the camp.

27:02.960 --> 27:08.205
So I shuffled around distant relatives
for a while.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.290
Eventually, Wes took me in.

27:11.920 --> 27:15.322
So Wes is the closest thing to family
I have left.

27:18.560 --> 27:19.891
Wow.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.048
I think we both need another Jell-O shot.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.085
I'll be right back.

27:26.680 --> 27:27.727
I'm glad that you came.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.321
Yeah, me too.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.801
- Hey, have you seen Jesse?
- No.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.201
Where are you going?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.081
To call Damon.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.726
To make sure that he doesn't kill Dr. Wes.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.085
There you are.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.125
Get away from me.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.805
Stefan?

28:29.000 --> 28:31.287
You're okay. Relax.

28:32.080 --> 28:34.845
I can't do that!
Do you understand me?

28:35.040 --> 28:36.087
Two options, Stefan.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.886
You either deal with this now or you run.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.082
But either way, it's gonna catch up to you.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.083
I can't breathe, Stefan.

28:46.480 --> 28:52.010
Stefan, tell me the name
of the first person that you killed.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.006
Name him.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.604
Giuseppe Salvatore.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.611
And the next?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.048
Focus on the name.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.485
Thomas Fell.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.251
See? You're in control.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.130
On solid ground.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.883
You're not drowning.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.809
You're not dying.

29:16.360 --> 29:17.691
Name them!

29:18.440 --> 29:22.081
Maria Fell, Marianna Lockwood...

29:22.320 --> 29:24.926
Christopher Gilbert, Margaret Forbes.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.683
See? I told you I knew what I was doing.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.049
Thank you.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.530
You're right.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.929
Gregor is dead.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.131
Happy now?

29:49.960 --> 29:52.566
You deserve better, Nadia.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.850
Rot in hell.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.646
Jesse feeds on vampires?

30:04.840 --> 30:06.524
That's what Doogie said.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.041
And, apparently, once he starts,
he can't stop.

30:09.280 --> 30:12.921
Hey, the fact that he told you this
means that he's still alive, right?

30:13.160 --> 30:14.810
- As of now.
- Good.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.847
<i>Please, don't kill him, Damon.</i>

30:18.680 --> 30:20.250
Damon?

30:20.440 --> 30:21.771
Tell me you won't kill him.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.004
Okay, okay, okay, I won't kill him.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.406
Bye.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.683
The problem is...

30:33.880 --> 30:35.882
I know people like you.

30:36.600 --> 30:40.321
A lot better than you realize. If I let
you live, you're gonna do it again.

30:40.600 --> 30:44.207
You're gonna turn another vampire,
you're gonna do another experiment.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.728
The only way to really handle you
is just to snuff you out.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.731
You're lucky I don't feel
like burying a body.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.161
- What did you do to me?
- Easy there, killer.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.806
Wasn't bad enough
that you poked me full of needles?

31:02.040 --> 31:03.724
Now I wanna feed on the girl I like?

31:04.240 --> 31:06.607
You feed on the monsters, Jesse.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.090
In case Professor Forbes forgot to tell you
in your training...

31:13.280 --> 31:16.329
I'm a lot older than you.
That means I'm a lot stronger.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.404
Actually, that's not 100-percent accurate.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.210
What the hell did they do to you?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.047
Damon!

31:43.280 --> 31:46.124
Jesse. Jesse, let go of him. Jesse!

31:46.320 --> 31:48.641
He's gonna tear my head off, Elena. Please.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.846
No! No!

31:56.360 --> 31:57.964
No, Jesse! Jesse!

31:58.160 --> 32:00.845
Come here. Hold on.
Hold on. Just stay with me, please.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.283
Jesse, just stay with me, please!

32:08.040 --> 32:09.530
No!

32:18.840 --> 32:20.126
What did you do?

32:20.320 --> 32:21.481
He was gonna kill Damon.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.568
But we promised that we would help him.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.444
She didn't have a choice, all right?

32:26.640 --> 32:29.883
Once he had the taste of vampire blood
there was nothing stopping him.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.923
Go ask Dr. Frankenstein.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.051
I'll go deal with him.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.450
Ow.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.401
Caroline, I'm so sorry.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.249
Yeah, me too.

32:54.440 --> 32:58.240
Because the Elena that I used to know
would've given Jesse a chance.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.604
<i>Dear Nadia.</i>

33:24.640 --> 33:28.440
<i>Sorry I had to kill your boyfriend,
but it was the motherly thing to do.</i>

33:28.880 --> 33:33.568
<i>Suicide, however, not very motherly of me.</i>

33:34.600 --> 33:38.082
<i>I ran from my enemies for 500 years...</i>

33:38.320 --> 33:41.688
<i>and then, one day, I stopped.</i>

33:43.600 --> 33:46.206
<i>Now a new enemy wants me dead.</i>

33:48.640 --> 33:50.722
<i>Sure, I could run from the Travelers...</i>

33:50.960 --> 33:54.601
<i>but there's still one enemy
that I can never escape:</i>

33:55.600 --> 33:56.806
<i>Time.</i>

34:03.600 --> 34:06.331
<i>So call it pride or vanity...</i>

34:06.560 --> 34:10.929
<i>but after the life that I've led,
I refuse to drift off into the sunset.</i>

34:11.639 --> 34:13.130
<i>Goodbye, Nadia.</i>

34:31.679 --> 34:33.205
What are you doing?

34:39.719 --> 34:41.085
I told you.

34:41.679 --> 34:45.889
You either face your problems or you run.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.731
I chose option three.

34:48.719 --> 34:54.523
And what problem has you jumping off
of a clock tower?

34:56.920 --> 34:58.763
I'm dying, Stefan.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.962
I'm dying of old age.

35:03.040 --> 35:08.683
I don't know, the cure did something
to speed up the entire mortifying process.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.886
<i>Hey-</i>

35:20.400 --> 35:22.323
You're Katherine Pierce.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.845
Suck it up.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.330
I'll admit it.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.164
I miss magic.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.368
Step away from the candles.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.171
Oh, my God.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.085
I think Jesse's dead.

36:45.560 --> 36:46.800
What?

36:52.080 --> 36:53.411
I'm not ready.

36:54.160 --> 36:55.685
I don't want this.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.126
Bonnie, what's going on?

37:03.680 --> 37:04.886
Bonnie.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.205
What was that?

37:12.760 --> 37:15.331
I'm the anchor to the other side, Jer.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.889
Every supernatural being that dies...

37:20.120 --> 37:21.531
has to pass through me.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.644
How often does that happen?

37:27.320 --> 37:30.005
Bonnie, why didn't you tell me?

37:31.120 --> 37:33.805
I'm back. Here.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.564
Touching you.

37:37.400 --> 37:40.131
We knew there'd be consequences.

37:43.960 --> 37:45.121
Just kiss me.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.567
- What?
- Kiss me.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.086
You...

37:59.040 --> 38:00.371
and me...

38:01.760 --> 38:03.171
this.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.010
This is worth it.

38:05.480 --> 38:09.201
Any consequence is worth this.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.481
I'm sorry.

38:44.680 --> 38:48.366
I didn't mean what I said earlier.
It was out of line.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.007
It just sucks, you know.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.328
Because Jesse was one of the good ones.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.050
I know.

38:56.560 --> 39:00.007
And I wouldn't have killed him
if I could've done something.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.725
He was dangerous.

39:02.560 --> 39:03.971
I need you to believe that.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.686
I need you to believe me
when I tell you that, Caroline.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.370
I believe you, okay?

39:12.560 --> 39:17.202
I believe you want to celebrate the fact
that we can function like regular freshmen.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.562
I get that. I want that too.

39:20.120 --> 39:23.203
But, Elena, when are you
gonna figure out...

39:23.400 --> 39:26.210
that the outside world
is not nearly as dangerous...

39:26.400 --> 39:29.449
as the person you're inviting
into your own bedroom?

39:30.640 --> 39:33.450
Wow, why don't you tell me
how you really feel?

39:35.760 --> 39:39.526
The day that I stop telling you is the
day that we're no longer best friends.

39:40.520 --> 39:44.889
And I hope that day never comes.

40:02.040 --> 40:05.487
If you're gonna do this, I'd much rather
prefer a bullet through the brain.

40:05.680 --> 40:09.526
Actually, I'm gonna wait until I can
compel all this out of your head.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.004
What the hell is that?

40:20.800 --> 40:23.087
Why does this say 12144?

40:23.280 --> 40:24.520
What do you care?

40:26.560 --> 40:29.370
Because I was 21051.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.002
21051, hang on.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.571
You were an Augustine vampire?

40:37.800 --> 40:40.690
Augustine.
I haven't heard that name in decades.

40:43.040 --> 40:46.010
Vampire lab rats, coded subject names.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.885
I thought you guys shut down 60 years ago.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.206
You thought wrong.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.842
You know when I said
I wasn't gonna kill you?

40:57.720 --> 40:59.051
I lied.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.689
Atomized vervain.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.651
When working with vampires,
you can never be too careful.

41:13.040 --> 41:17.011
I'm sure Augustine will be thrilled
to have you back.
