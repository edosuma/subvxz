01:49.871 --> 01:51.570
Take the shot, Steve.

05:32.873 --> 05:34.104
Did you hear Mayor Cockran
is going to

05:34.106 --> 05:35.971
double the parking fines
later this month?

05:35.973 --> 05:37.673
He ain't the mayor yet.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.638
You feeling all right?

05:41.640 --> 05:43.173
Why wouldn't I be?

05:45.106 --> 05:47.706
Catie told me you stopped by
the bar last night?

05:49.807 --> 05:51.671
Let me tell you
something right now.

05:51.673 --> 05:54.106
I don't like people
keeping tabs on me, okay?

05:58.373 --> 06:00.740
I made a fresh pot
of coffee, Marshal.

06:07.273 --> 06:08.840
Thank you.

06:13.106 --> 06:16.071
She said you
had some bad news.

06:16.073 --> 06:17.139
Yeah.

06:19.139 --> 06:21.172
Who was Steve Lucas?

06:21.174 --> 06:24.905
Steve was a Texas Ranger.

06:24.907 --> 06:27.873
He was my partner
until I shot him.

06:33.374 --> 06:35.971
What happened?

06:35.973 --> 06:39.072
We were serving a felony arrest
warrant just outside of Dallas.

06:39.074 --> 06:41.207
Suspect got the jump on him.

06:43.140 --> 06:44.305
Your partner
gets taken hostage,

06:44.307 --> 06:46.939
you do not give up
your weapon,

06:46.941 --> 06:49.174
otherwise,
you'll both end up dead.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.272
- But how did you...
- Steve was being held from behind.

06:55.274 --> 06:57.272
He called out his name
to me which was a signal

06:57.274 --> 07:00.671
that he was gonna drop
and then I was to take the shot.

07:00.673 --> 07:03.174
But the kidnapper must have
suspected something.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.971
My bullet left Steve paralyzed
from the neck down.

07:07.973 --> 07:10.174
He lay in a hospital bed
for 10 years.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.040
He died last week.

07:19.074 --> 07:22.107
Never got to touch his wife
or hold his kids ever again.

07:24.207 --> 07:26.240
Is that why you don't carry
a gun?

07:28.340 --> 07:30.005
I've not picked up
a weapon since.

07:30.007 --> 07:31.338
But, like I said,
I don't like people

07:31.340 --> 07:33.774
keeping tabs on me, okay?

08:18.841 --> 08:20.108
<i>I'm gonna go make this deposit.</i>

08:22.075 --> 08:24.739
Say hi to that new teller.

08:24.741 --> 08:27.173
What new teller?

08:36.808 --> 08:39.041
What do you figure they're
doing all the way out here?

08:40.207 --> 08:42.373
Breakfast maybe.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.808
Yeah.

09:04.708 --> 09:05.840
Thank you, Catie.

09:05.842 --> 09:07.840
I didn't see you Sunday,
Mr. Bozeman.

09:07.842 --> 09:11.640
I know, and I'm sorry.
I was just feeling a bit poorly.

09:11.642 --> 09:14.106
But I heard you gave
a good sermon.

09:14.108 --> 09:15.406
It's all right.
We're not judged

09:15.408 --> 09:17.039
by how many sermons
we sit through.

09:17.041 --> 09:19.106
But I sat through
some rough ones in my time.

09:19.108 --> 09:20.341
Ain't that the truth?

09:34.642 --> 09:36.374
Phillip,
you're my campaign manager.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.740
It's your job to press
my contributors.

09:38.742 --> 09:41.274
- I need a war chest.
- A war chest?

09:41.276 --> 09:44.872
What for?
Nobody else is gonna file.

09:44.874 --> 09:47.640
Closing date's not for a week.

09:47.642 --> 09:49.640
Who you afraid of? Jim Dillon?

09:49.642 --> 09:51.207
Afraid he'll throw his hat
in the ring?

09:51.209 --> 09:54.675
I'm not afraid of anybody,
especially, not Jim Dillon.

10:30.009 --> 10:31.707
- Give me a beer.
- Sorry, sir.

10:31.709 --> 10:34.107
We don't serve alcohol
till after 5:00 PM.

10:34.109 --> 10:35.307
I didn't ask
what you were serving.

10:35.309 --> 10:38.274
I told you to get me a beer.

10:38.276 --> 10:41.176
I told you we're not serving
beer till after 5:00 PM.

10:45.743 --> 10:47.209
Let go.

11:33.742 --> 11:35.708
What's going on here,
fellas?

11:37.277 --> 11:39.310
- Nothing much, Officer.
- Yeah?

11:41.177 --> 11:43.010
Don't look like nothing to me.

11:54.077 --> 11:57.010
Stay down, son, or I'll give her
another run at you.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.742
You need to get out.

12:05.810 --> 12:06.910
You okay?

12:30.110 --> 12:32.141
- Hey, Amanda.
- Hey, Matt.

12:32.143 --> 12:33.808
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

12:33.810 --> 12:36.108
- Hanging in there.
- Good.

12:36.110 --> 12:38.008
- Hot outside.
- Yeah.

12:38.010 --> 12:40.808
So I was thinking
on my walk over here,

12:40.810 --> 12:44.008
would you wanna have dinner
with me next week?

12:44.010 --> 12:45.641
Don't you have a girlfriend?

12:45.643 --> 12:48.376
No. I did, but I don't now.

12:48.378 --> 12:49.874
That's been over
for quite a while.

12:49.876 --> 12:52.741
Oh. I'll think about it.

12:52.743 --> 12:54.077
Great.

13:02.743 --> 13:04.008
- You got nothing on me, man.
- Sit down.

13:04.010 --> 13:05.610
I was defending myself.

13:23.843 --> 13:26.808
I need you to run this prisoner
to county lockup by yourself.

13:26.810 --> 13:30.011
- By myself?
- Yeah. I'm staying here.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.975
What's wrong?

13:32.977 --> 13:34.409
These boys
are riding into town,

13:34.411 --> 13:36.674
starting a fight
with only of them involved.

13:36.676 --> 13:38.842
The other one
just watching on.

13:38.844 --> 13:40.577
Don't make sense.

13:42.676 --> 13:44.178
Can you get him processed?

13:57.311 --> 13:59.342
Let's go.

13:59.344 --> 14:00.842
<i>Where you taking me?</i>

14:00.844 --> 14:03.742
Watch your head stepping
inside, sir.

14:03.744 --> 14:05.610
I'll expect
you back here by noon.

14:07.811 --> 14:11.742
- Just a minute, Marshal.
- Councilor.

14:11.744 --> 14:14.642
<i>I wanna talk to you
about what happened at the diner.</i>

14:14.644 --> 14:16.209
<i>I saw you hiding in the corner.</i>

14:16.211 --> 14:17.942
That was a god safe place to be.

14:17.944 --> 14:21.675
I'm talking about last night
when you were drinking.

14:21.677 --> 14:22.975
I was off duty.

14:22.977 --> 14:25.209
As town marshal,
you're always on duty.

14:25.211 --> 14:28.176
- What do you want, Rogers?
- As mayor, I'm putting you on notice.

14:28.178 --> 14:30.042
- Acting mayor.
- Beg your pardon?

14:30.044 --> 14:31.708
You're not mayor yet.

14:31.710 --> 14:34.009
Then as acting mayor,
I'm putting you on notice

14:34.011 --> 14:35.675
since you've been
added to the agenda

14:35.677 --> 14:37.742
of the next board
of supervisors meeting.

14:37.744 --> 14:41.675
We're gonna discus your behavior
last night and this morning.

14:41.677 --> 14:43.277
Well, I'm flattered.

14:43.279 --> 14:46.312
Have a nice day, Marshal.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.012
Yeah. I'll be there in 30.

16:05.978 --> 16:08.709
- Didn't hurt you, did he?
- No.

16:08.711 --> 16:10.311
He hit like a girl.

16:10.313 --> 16:12.179
Well, not a girl like you.

16:14.045 --> 16:15.976
So I was thinking...

16:15.978 --> 16:18.778
maybe you could come over later
and we can ride before dark.

16:20.711 --> 16:23.643
The horses are getting
a little antsy.

16:23.645 --> 16:25.845
Well, we can't have that now,
can we?

16:29.146 --> 16:30.910
Definitely not.

16:30.912 --> 16:32.711
Show me that. Does it hurt?

16:34.978 --> 16:36.945
Nah. You're tough.

17:11.146 --> 17:15.046
Hello? Hello?

17:16.913 --> 17:18.810
Did your phone just die?

17:18.813 --> 17:20.612
Yeah.
I'm not getting a signal.

17:40.646 --> 17:42.180
It's not the breaker.

17:45.746 --> 17:47.679
I ought to see
what's going on.

18:08.413 --> 18:09.846
Look out.

18:13.313 --> 18:15.247
What the hell?

18:25.679 --> 18:27.247
Sir, can you hear me?

18:28.779 --> 18:31.644
Sir, stay put.

18:31.646 --> 18:33.978
Can you hear me, sir?
Sir? Whoa, whoa. Okay.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.644
Yeah. I can hear you
loud and clear, motherfucker.

18:35.646 --> 18:36.912
Can you hear me? Huh?

18:36.914 --> 18:39.012
- Okay. Wait.
- Now, get in the car.

18:39.014 --> 18:40.311
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Move, motherfucker.

18:40.313 --> 18:42.280
Okay. All right.
All right. All right.

18:43.980 --> 18:46.411
Get in. Get the fuck in.

18:46.413 --> 18:48.145
Move your legs.

18:48.147 --> 18:49.346
Motherfucker.

19:06.147 --> 19:09.978
All right. He is three miles up.
Just went 10-8 off a signal 21.

19:09.980 --> 19:12.112
Bro, seriously.
What does that even mean?

19:12.114 --> 19:14.313
Back in service
after a traffic stop.

20:14.082 --> 20:16.046
Two, three, one,
Paul, Robert, Paul.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.281
79 South.
10-mile marker.

20:30.048 --> 20:31.848
We got 90 minutes.

20:37.981 --> 20:39.345
Morning, ma'am.

20:39.347 --> 20:40.879
Is there something wrong,
Officer?

20:40.881 --> 20:41.946
Yes, ma'am.
The reason I'm stopping you

20:41.948 --> 20:43.212
is 'cause you were speeding.

20:43.214 --> 20:44.679
<i>I need to see
your driver's license,</i>

20:44.681 --> 20:47.080
registration, and proof
of insurance please.

20:47.082 --> 20:48.146
I would.

20:52.815 --> 20:55.646
What did you do? No one
was supposed to get killed.

20:55.648 --> 20:58.214
You get out of here right now
or you're going to be next.

21:06.147 --> 21:07.614
- Got it?
- Yeah.

22:10.849 --> 22:13.248
Always a pleasure seeing you,
Marshal.

22:14.882 --> 22:16.849
Now, how about you give me
that radio?

23:07.715 --> 23:09.680
Put your hands up, up!

23:09.682 --> 23:11.181
- <i>Put your hands up!</i>
- Get the fuck up, move!

23:11.183 --> 23:13.747
Go to that fucking door!
Go, go, go!

23:13.749 --> 23:14.947
- <i>Move!</i>
- <i>Don't make me fucking shoot!</i>

23:14.949 --> 23:16.281
<i>Come on, move, move!</i>

23:16.283 --> 23:17.880
Come on, get the door.
Move, move, move!

23:17.882 --> 23:19.981
Hey, come on, move!

23:19.983 --> 23:21.081
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

23:21.083 --> 23:22.147
Get in the window!

23:22.149 --> 23:23.847
Hands up or I'll fucking shoot!

23:23.849 --> 23:25.147
Hey, hands up!
Hands!

23:34.749 --> 23:37.014
So this is where they post you
after you shot your partner,

23:37.016 --> 23:38.283
huh, Marshal?

23:40.183 --> 23:44.381
Marshal James Dillon, I assume.

23:44.383 --> 23:46.214
<i>Well, I got to tell you,
I'm kind of surprised</i>

23:46.216 --> 23:48.081
to see you here.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.147
I thought you and your partner

23:49.149 --> 23:50.214
be transferring to prison

23:50.216 --> 23:51.748
or to county together.

23:51.750 --> 23:52.848
That's the procedure,
ain't it, Marshal?

23:52.850 --> 23:53.850
Who are you?

23:56.216 --> 23:58.716
Things haven't changed
much around here, huh?

24:00.349 --> 24:02.616
<i>Still the same.</i>

24:05.116 --> 24:06.980
My name is Diablo.

24:06.982 --> 24:08.047
Not really my Christian name.

24:08.049 --> 24:09.283
It's what my friends call me.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.616
And my enemies.

24:12.850 --> 24:13.915
I guess my question to you

24:13.917 --> 24:14.980
is which one are you gonna be?

24:14.982 --> 24:16.081
Are you gonna be my friend

24:16.083 --> 24:17.147
<i>or are you gonna be my enemy?</i>

24:22.417 --> 24:24.748
You don't wanna hurt nobody
in this town.

24:24.750 --> 24:25.883
Why, what are you gonna do?
You're gonna arrest me?

24:27.783 --> 24:30.181
'Cause I'm not going back
to prison again.

24:30.183 --> 24:31.683
You're gonna have to shoot me.

24:32.917 --> 24:34.980
I don't wanna have to find out.

24:34.982 --> 24:36.616
Sounds like a threat.

24:38.284 --> 24:39.415
But I understand
that's the paradigm

24:39.417 --> 24:41.248
which you operate.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.415
Simple conditioning.
Well, it's kind of like...

24:43.417 --> 24:45.182
it's kind of like Pavlov's dog.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.781
You see a threat
or you see a problem,

24:46.783 --> 24:48.683
you take charge, right?

24:50.982 --> 24:52.881
Well, that paradigm
is no longer valid.

24:52.883 --> 24:56.082
There is a new paradigm
in town...

24:56.084 --> 25:00.783
and a new marshal.

25:03.417 --> 25:05.881
From now on, you do what I want,
when I want,

25:05.883 --> 25:08.050
and you might just make it out
of this fine day,

25:09.250 --> 25:11.050
you understand, Marshal?

25:16.284 --> 25:17.849
I said do you understand,
Marshal?

25:17.851 --> 25:19.583
I am gonna arrest you.

25:22.384 --> 25:24.350
I respect a man with confidence.

25:26.084 --> 25:28.816
Pyro, open the vault.

25:33.084 --> 25:34.784
- <i>Come here, sweetie.</i>
- <i>Baby.</i>

25:36.751 --> 25:38.881
I need you to take me

25:38.883 --> 25:40.184
to your vault.

25:43.017 --> 25:44.382
I can't.

25:44.384 --> 25:46.248
Hey, hey, you fucking
listen to me, okay?

25:46.250 --> 25:48.148
If you lie to me about anything,

25:48.150 --> 25:49.749
anything at all,

25:49.751 --> 25:52.082
<i>I'm gonna get
real irritated, okay?</i>

25:52.084 --> 25:54.115
And the rest of your day...
let's just say

25:54.117 --> 25:55.981
there won't be
a rest of your day.

25:55.983 --> 25:58.182
The vault, it's set
on a time clock.

25:58.184 --> 26:00.182
I can't open it
even if I want to.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.315
Opens at noon.

26:04.250 --> 26:05.948
It's only...

26:05.950 --> 26:07.248
Okay.

26:07.250 --> 26:09.349
So two minutes away.

26:09.351 --> 26:11.749
Kind of like we knew
the schedule, huh?

26:11.751 --> 26:13.082
Why don't we take a little walk.

26:15.351 --> 26:16.850
Open it.

26:25.318 --> 26:26.981
- Come on.
- Okay.

26:28.917 --> 26:30.848
Now, listen,
if you play any fucking games with me,

26:30.850 --> 26:32.815
I'm gonna shoot your kidney,
You feel that?

26:32.817 --> 26:34.316
You don't have to worry
about that.

26:34.318 --> 26:36.349
I'm not the one worrying, babe.

26:36.351 --> 26:38.349
Let's go!

26:39.850 --> 26:41.283
- It's open, it's open.
- Move.

27:32.685 --> 27:33.918
<i>Get the fuck down.</i>

27:35.751 --> 27:37.185
Here your bitch back, Marshal.

27:50.851 --> 27:52.216
I'm sorry.

27:52.218 --> 27:53.882
Now is not the time
to start feeling sorry

27:53.884 --> 27:54.884
for yourself.

28:13.286 --> 28:14.417
Lock them in the church.

28:14.419 --> 28:16.050
Move it!

28:16.052 --> 28:17.849
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

28:17.851 --> 28:19.685
Stay out of that church.

28:23.319 --> 28:25.117
My, my, my.

28:25.119 --> 28:26.685
Catie Reynolds.

28:28.717 --> 28:29.849
<i>You sure have grown up.</i>

28:29.851 --> 28:30.885
<i>Let's go.</i>

28:32.352 --> 28:33.751
Do I know you?

28:35.319 --> 28:37.184
No, not really.

28:37.186 --> 28:39.150
I knew your father.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.284
Little too heavy on the fire

28:40.286 --> 28:41.850
and brimstone for my liking.

28:41.852 --> 28:43.883
But I guess that comes
with a job, huh?

28:43.885 --> 28:45.750
<i>Now I understand your back,
trying to hold together</i>

28:45.752 --> 28:47.850
<i>this piece of shit town.</i>

28:47.852 --> 28:50.350
What is it that you want?

28:50.352 --> 28:52.217
I guess I'm like
the prodigal son

28:52.219 --> 28:54.250
that's back to collect his dues.

28:54.252 --> 28:55.718
And then you'll leave us?

28:57.352 --> 28:59.017
Not yet.

28:59.019 --> 29:00.852
There ain't nothing else
to steal here.

29:05.252 --> 29:08.817
There will be in 28 minutes.

29:08.819 --> 29:10.350
That's an armored truck.

29:10.352 --> 29:12.750
First sign of trouble,
they'll call the state police.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.317
We'll have to see, won't we?

29:14.319 --> 29:15.319
Put them in the vault.

29:35.985 --> 29:37.783
<i>Hey, Candi, how are you doing?</i>

29:37.785 --> 29:39.318
I'm dead on my feet.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.084
Well, you look great.

29:41.086 --> 29:42.950
Well, I hate working days.

29:42.952 --> 29:44.218
Nobody tips.

29:44.220 --> 29:46.351
How about I take you out
to dinner?

29:46.353 --> 29:49.318
You never give up, do you?

29:49.320 --> 29:52.017
How many times
have you asked me out?

29:52.019 --> 29:54.017
Eighteen now.

29:54.019 --> 29:57.018
Well, my shift started
at 4:00 AM this morning.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.783
Well, how about lupper?

29:58.785 --> 30:00.085
You know, it's like brunch,

30:00.087 --> 30:01.718
but in between lunch and supper.

30:03.685 --> 30:04.750
Come on.

30:08.718 --> 30:09.951
All right.

30:09.953 --> 30:11.716
But you've got to promise

30:11.718 --> 30:13.918
to take me home early.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.918
Like 7:00 early.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.187
Okay, I'll see you at 2:00.

30:26.853 --> 30:28.151
How much this time?

30:28.153 --> 30:29.684
Fifteen million,

30:29.686 --> 30:31.684
four hundred
thirty-two thousand,

30:31.686 --> 30:33.984
three hundred
and twenty-two dollars.

30:33.986 --> 30:37.151
Should, could buy a lot of tacos
with this kind of scrap, huh?

30:37.153 --> 30:39.684
I'm gonna ignore that
racist-ass comment.

30:39.686 --> 30:42.220
But, yeah, I could buy a bunch
of tacos with that money.

30:43.886 --> 30:45.717
All right, man, let's go.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.818
<i>I got to be back before 2:00.</i>

31:00.686 --> 31:02.251
Comm check, over.

31:02.253 --> 31:04.419
Base Alpha One,
comm check, over.

31:04.421 --> 31:05.984
<i>five by five.</i>

31:05.986 --> 31:07.285
We're on the move.

31:59.987 --> 32:01.854
Be careful, compadre.

32:15.088 --> 32:16.152
Matt.

32:36.121 --> 32:37.121
You in the car.

32:39.321 --> 32:41.186
Hey, Big Dog get my back.

32:41.188 --> 32:42.752
Get out of the car.

32:42.754 --> 32:44.152
Get out of the car.

32:44.154 --> 32:45.219
Hey, stop.

32:57.355 --> 32:58.355
Hey.

33:02.754 --> 33:06.187
Hey, I will blow her brains
all over the pavement,

33:06.189 --> 33:07.189
you hear me?

33:09.421 --> 33:11.089
I'm not fucking around.

33:13.421 --> 33:15.253
I will shoot her right now.

33:15.255 --> 33:16.919
Come up with your hands
above your head,

33:16.921 --> 33:18.687
throw your weapon on the ground.

33:21.022 --> 33:24.187
Ten, nine...

33:26.887 --> 33:28.320
Test me again.

33:28.322 --> 33:29.955
Test me again.

33:36.255 --> 33:39.687
Marshal, are you listening?

33:41.955 --> 33:44.685
You and your rookie deputy?

33:44.687 --> 33:46.220
Nah, damn.

33:46.222 --> 33:48.320
We're gonna need backup.

33:48.322 --> 33:50.020
Yeah, we probably do.

33:50.022 --> 33:52.688
But for now, unfortunately,
it's just you and me.

33:55.688 --> 33:58.653
Eight, seven,

33:58.655 --> 34:00.853
six, five...

34:00.855 --> 34:02.053
<i>Stop!</i>

34:02.055 --> 34:03.320
Stop!

34:03.322 --> 34:04.653
<i>She's my wife!</i>

34:04.655 --> 34:05.786
<i>Let her go.</i>

34:05.788 --> 34:07.153
Oh, no, Martin.

34:07.155 --> 34:08.286
What the hell is he doing?

34:08.289 --> 34:10.187
He's surrendering.

34:10.188 --> 34:11.588
That's suicide.

34:13.155 --> 34:14.920
Please.

34:14.922 --> 34:16.786
Please.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.985
No, no, no, no.

34:18.987 --> 34:20.888
- Holy shit.
- <i>Please.</i>

34:23.155 --> 34:24.286
You're his wife?

34:24.289 --> 34:25.420
Yes.

34:25.422 --> 34:26.688
Yeah?

34:33.922 --> 34:36.719
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

34:36.721 --> 34:39.355
<i>Marshal, five...</i>

34:41.987 --> 34:43.120
four...

34:43.121 --> 34:44.121
<i>Matt.</i>

34:45.655 --> 34:48.190
Three, two...

34:57.023 --> 34:58.254
One.

35:28.722 --> 35:29.856
Here we go.

35:42.156 --> 35:43.420
Pyro, go.

35:43.422 --> 35:44.987
Go.

35:44.989 --> 35:46.054
Spider.

36:03.190 --> 36:04.190
Spider.

36:34.923 --> 36:35.923
Keep moving.

37:09.091 --> 37:11.122
What the hell
Jim doing out there?

37:11.124 --> 37:12.988
Trying to save us.

37:12.990 --> 37:15.955
Well, he's not doing
a very good job of it.

37:15.957 --> 37:17.955
When this is over,
the Town Council

37:17.957 --> 37:19.955
is gonna review Jim's contract.

37:19.957 --> 37:21.321
Really?

37:21.323 --> 37:23.354
Is not the right time
for this discussion?

37:23.356 --> 37:24.888
Can't you wait
until we're out of this mess

37:24.890 --> 37:27.721
before you cook up a scheme
to fire Jim?

37:27.723 --> 37:30.288
This is not about
firing Jim Dillon,

37:30.290 --> 37:32.221
<i>it's about what's best
for the town.</i>

37:32.223 --> 37:34.089
Quiet as a mouse.

37:34.091 --> 37:37.755
No, Rogers, it's not.

37:37.757 --> 37:39.721
This is about you and me,

37:39.723 --> 37:42.955
and there will never be
a you and me.

38:01.156 --> 38:03.355
What are we doing?

38:03.357 --> 38:05.755
Hey, listen,
I need you to go out to the highway

38:05.757 --> 38:08.422
and flag down
the armored truck, okay?

38:08.424 --> 38:10.090
What about you?

38:10.092 --> 38:11.255
Take these.

38:11.257 --> 38:12.355
I'm staying here.

38:12.357 --> 38:15.056
Go, just to what I tell you.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.624
Andale, andale, arriba, arriba.

39:31.991 --> 39:33.689
Jim, it's Matt.

39:33.691 --> 39:36.055
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

39:36.057 --> 39:37.956
I know who it is, Matt.

39:37.958 --> 39:41.323
There's a state trooper parked
at the end of the county road.

39:41.325 --> 39:43.055
<i>I'm gonna try
to make contact with him</i>

39:43.057 --> 39:45.190
<i>and see if I can get him
to call for back-up.</i>

39:45.192 --> 39:46.789
Negative, the gang
are monitoring

39:46.791 --> 39:48.256
police frequencies.

39:48.258 --> 39:49.889
Listen, why don't you tell
the trooper

39:49.891 --> 39:50.956
<i>to drive to
the state police barracks</i>

39:50.958 --> 39:53.022
<i>and just bring reinforcements?</i>

39:53.024 --> 39:54.323
<i>That could take forever.</i>

39:54.325 --> 39:56.323
What are we supposed to do
until then?

39:56.325 --> 39:57.325
Don't get yourself killed.

40:14.325 --> 40:16.689
Hey, compadre,
we're approaching the turnout.

40:16.691 --> 40:18.258
<i>Siesta time is over.</i>

40:57.025 --> 40:58.358
What the hell?

41:02.125 --> 41:03.323
Hey, why are we slowing down?

41:03.325 --> 41:05.190
State trooper up ahead.

41:05.192 --> 41:07.757
- Is it a wreck?
- Don't look like it.

41:07.759 --> 41:09.824
Better not make me late.

41:27.159 --> 41:28.890
What's going on, Sir?

41:28.892 --> 41:30.124
Gas leak.

41:30.126 --> 41:31.690
Can we get in?

41:31.692 --> 41:33.357
Yeah, it's cleared up now.
You'll be fine.

41:33.359 --> 41:35.224
Are you sure? Because, you know,
I'd hate to get blown up.

41:35.226 --> 41:36.291
You... you'll be okay.

41:36.293 --> 41:37.357
Don't worry.

41:37.359 --> 41:38.424
All right.

41:51.293 --> 41:54.257
Jim, they got
the state trooper, too.

41:54.259 --> 41:56.957
The armored truck is on its way.

41:56.959 --> 41:59.391
<i>I'm coming back to you.</i>

41:59.393 --> 42:00.690
Okay.

42:26.859 --> 42:29.890
You should've seen that inbreed.

42:29.892 --> 42:31.257
It looks like his parents
were brother,

42:31.259 --> 42:33.758
and sister, and first cousins.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.990
Hey, well, if the state's taking
in inbreeds,

42:35.992 --> 42:37.724
<i>maybe you should apply.</i>

42:37.726 --> 42:39.026
Ha ha.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.425
Better be cool.

44:20.893 --> 44:22.227
Hey, you seeing this?

44:26.960 --> 44:28.258
Yeah, where is everybody?

44:28.260 --> 44:30.326
Must be the gas leak.

44:30.328 --> 44:32.125
You think maybe
we should head over

44:32.127 --> 44:33.426
to the backup truck?

44:33.428 --> 44:35.359
That's another 32 miles.

44:35.361 --> 44:36.692
We'll never make it back
by 2:00.

44:36.694 --> 44:38.393
Okay, hotshot, don't sweat it,

44:38.395 --> 44:40.825
I'll get you back in time
for your date.

45:12.028 --> 45:13.028
Here they come.

45:37.661 --> 45:40.359
Why don't you go inside first,
make sure everything's cool?

45:40.361 --> 45:43.028
Maybe they closed
because of the gas leak.

45:51.894 --> 45:54.193
Hey, do you think
something's up?

45:54.195 --> 45:55.359
With the whole town?

45:55.361 --> 45:57.359
I'm just saying.

45:57.361 --> 45:59.126
It's your turn.

45:59.128 --> 46:00.794
It's always my turn.

47:46.062 --> 47:47.960
But something doesn't
smell right.

48:07.762 --> 48:09.062
Hey, you're late.

48:11.297 --> 48:13.130
Easy, cowboy.

48:17.230 --> 48:18.929
Lopez, somebody just shot at me.

48:22.895 --> 48:23.895
Spread out.

48:25.197 --> 48:27.760
<i>Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.</i>

48:27.762 --> 48:29.197
Mayday. We're be...

48:32.795 --> 48:34.695
Don't make me shoot
your partner.

48:38.030 --> 48:39.328
I don't have all day.

48:39.330 --> 48:43.028
Hey, man,
I'm just doing my job, bro.

48:43.030 --> 48:45.197
We're all here
just doing our job.

48:46.330 --> 48:48.128
Unlock the door.

48:48.130 --> 48:49.295
No.

48:49.297 --> 48:50.297
No?

48:58.763 --> 49:01.095
They just killed my partner.

49:01.097 --> 49:03.028
- Do you copy? Mayday. Mayday.
- Unlock it.

49:03.030 --> 49:07.028
- We're being robbed. Mayday...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

49:07.030 --> 49:08.994
Nobody can hear you.

49:08.996 --> 49:10.263
That shot took out your antenna.

49:14.729 --> 49:15.994
We have protocols.

49:15.996 --> 49:18.161
If I don't call in
in 10 minutes...

49:18.163 --> 49:20.161
No. No.

49:20.163 --> 49:22.128
Sixty minutes.

49:22.130 --> 49:24.295
I read all your protocols.

49:24.297 --> 49:26.095
Sixty minutes after you log in,

49:26.097 --> 49:29.028
if your dispatcher can't reach
or hear you,

49:29.030 --> 49:31.296
she calls local police,

49:31.298 --> 49:33.128
60 minutes.

49:33.130 --> 49:35.028
But do you think I'm gonna
let you sit in there

49:35.030 --> 49:36.298
for 60 minutes?

49:47.298 --> 49:49.097
You got a dilemma, my friend,

49:50.729 --> 49:53.894
a choice between
the lesser of two evils.

49:53.896 --> 49:55.994
Option one,

49:55.996 --> 49:57.928
you open the door,

49:57.930 --> 50:01.296
you live the rest of your life
with your own abject failure.

50:01.298 --> 50:03.196
Option two,

50:03.198 --> 50:04.861
you don't open the door,

50:04.863 --> 50:06.729
you die a hero.

50:13.231 --> 50:15.727
Jim, where are you?

50:15.729 --> 50:17.694
<i>I'm just leaving my house.</i>

50:17.696 --> 50:19.196
I'm by the feed store.

50:19.198 --> 50:21.231
I think I see someone upstairs
with a rifle.

50:22.964 --> 50:25.262
I'm gonna try to break inside
and check it out.

50:25.264 --> 50:26.264
<i>Copy.</i>

50:45.764 --> 50:47.995
But, unfortunately,
I don't have all day.

50:47.997 --> 50:50.162
So you got to make a choice.

50:50.164 --> 50:53.795
Now, I know what you're doing,

50:53.797 --> 50:55.329
you're scrambling,

50:55.331 --> 50:58.862
you're trying to think
of a third option, aren't you?

50:58.864 --> 51:00.662
There isn't one.

51:00.664 --> 51:01.864
There's no more.

51:05.831 --> 51:07.964
Can you hear me through this,
huh?

51:09.031 --> 51:11.198
There's no more fucking options!

51:26.265 --> 51:27.265
We're all set.

51:28.697 --> 51:30.197
You see?
Now it's too late.

52:19.965 --> 52:20.965
Do it.

52:59.065 --> 53:00.130
Yeah!

53:02.765 --> 53:03.996
Big Dog, load it up.

53:03.998 --> 53:05.063
Pyro, go light it.

53:05.065 --> 53:06.663
Yeah, I'm on it.

53:06.665 --> 53:09.397
- And what was Pyro lighting up?
- What do you mean?

53:09.399 --> 53:10.930
We can't just let him get away.
He's seen our faces.

53:10.932 --> 53:12.363
Yeah, what does that matter,
all right?

53:12.365 --> 53:14.430
We're gonna be out of
the country in 12 hours.

53:14.432 --> 53:16.830
Hey, no one was supposed
to get hurt.

53:16.832 --> 53:18.696
No one's ever supposed
to get hurt.

53:18.698 --> 53:20.064
Man, it just happens.

53:20.066 --> 53:22.031
Oh, so you're just gonna
kill them all, huh?

53:22.033 --> 53:23.330
Hey, why don't you just go
to every house

53:23.332 --> 53:25.199
and shoot everybody?

53:26.299 --> 53:27.798
Like you did in Iraq?

53:30.299 --> 53:32.897
Huh? Don't pretend
like you're not a murderer.

53:32.899 --> 53:34.966
- That was war.
- This is war!

53:36.866 --> 53:37.866
Fuck you.

53:45.731 --> 53:47.330
Ah, ah, ah, whoa.

53:47.332 --> 53:49.265
- Want me to kill him?
- No, no.

53:52.100 --> 53:53.100
He'll come around.

54:55.666 --> 54:58.231
Everything's going to be okay.

54:58.233 --> 55:00.831
How do you know that?

55:00.833 --> 55:02.398
Jim and Matt are out there
alone.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.599
Look at us.

55:50.266 --> 55:51.266
Come with me.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.934
Jim, where are you?

56:28.834 --> 56:31.265
Jim, it's Matt, where are you?

56:31.267 --> 56:34.031
Matt, where are you?

56:34.033 --> 56:36.865
I'm upstairs
above the feed store.

56:36.867 --> 56:38.665
I took one of them out.

56:38.667 --> 56:40.099
I got his gun.

56:40.101 --> 56:42.299
It's a rifle with a scope.

56:42.301 --> 56:44.399
Okay, good.
Well, stay high,

56:44.401 --> 56:46.367
see if you can make use
of that weapon.

57:20.768 --> 57:22.699
Marshal?

57:22.701 --> 57:24.101
Hold your position.

57:25.967 --> 57:26.967
Fuck.

58:00.934 --> 58:03.333
You, you,

58:03.335 --> 58:05.200
Preacher's daughter,
come here.

58:05.202 --> 58:06.901
- Don't you touch her.
- Shut up.

58:17.701 --> 58:18.900
Marshal, he's got Catie.

58:31.235 --> 58:33.368
<i>Matt, do not make a move.</i>

58:37.202 --> 58:38.202
<i>Marshal.</i>

58:40.035 --> 58:41.035
Marshal.

58:47.735 --> 58:48.769
Hey, Marshal.

58:50.102 --> 58:52.899
Marshal.
I've got somebody here

58:52.901 --> 58:55.933
that wants you
to turn yourself in.

58:55.935 --> 58:58.866
You do want him
to turn himself in, don't you?

58:58.868 --> 58:59.868
Huh?

59:01.868 --> 59:03.667
Hmm?

59:03.669 --> 59:05.100
Shit.

59:05.102 --> 59:07.202
I'm not fucking around, Marshal.

59:08.368 --> 59:09.700
Marshal, I can't get a shot.

59:09.702 --> 59:11.368
Matt, stand down.

59:14.769 --> 59:17.302
My associate will shoot her
in the fucking face.

59:20.302 --> 59:21.635
Hey, lawman.

59:27.835 --> 59:29.933
You and your partner.

59:29.935 --> 59:31.602
You're running out of time.

59:33.769 --> 59:35.769
Marshal.

59:38.702 --> 59:39.702
Okay.

59:45.935 --> 59:48.367
All right, Marshal, that's it.

59:48.369 --> 59:49.369
Shoot her.

59:52.203 --> 59:53.203
<i>Stop.</i>

01:00:01.269 --> 01:00:02.866
Good decision, deputy.

01:00:02.868 --> 01:00:04.069
Don't hurt her.

01:00:12.303 --> 01:00:13.833
Shit.

01:00:17.836 --> 01:00:19.934
Hey, hey. No, no, no, no.
Come here, come here.

01:00:19.936 --> 01:00:20.936
Come here.

01:00:30.403 --> 01:00:32.234
I hate this fucking town.

01:00:32.236 --> 01:00:33.236
You know that?

01:00:47.369 --> 01:00:50.434
<i>Big Dog, come here.</i>

01:00:50.436 --> 01:00:51.834
Go check that out.

01:02:00.204 --> 01:02:01.903
You, motherfucker.

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:04.870
I'm gonna get you, Marshal.

01:02:06.003 --> 01:02:07.970
Son of a bitch.
Get him inside.

01:02:12.837 --> 01:02:14.937
Matt. Matt.

01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:19.270
Get me another truck.

01:03:05.937 --> 01:03:07.868
Don't make a sound.

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:08.870
Walk.

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:24.703
Pyro, man.

01:03:27.004 --> 01:03:28.603
We need to get that
fucking Marshal.

01:03:30.338 --> 01:03:33.902
No, man, we got
what we came here for, right?

01:03:33.904 --> 01:03:35.871
Uh, so let's just get
out of here, brother.

01:03:39.004 --> 01:03:40.138
What's that say?

01:03:41.838 --> 01:03:42.871
Huh?

01:03:44.405 --> 01:03:45.736
What's that say?

01:03:47.904 --> 01:03:49.138
Never forgive.

01:03:51.105 --> 01:03:52.105
Yeah.

01:03:55.004 --> 01:03:56.938
- Never forgive.
- Okay.

01:04:07.171 --> 01:04:08.171
Inside.

01:04:27.205 --> 01:04:28.871
Why did you all come
to this town?

01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:33.169
Diablo was born here.

01:04:33.171 --> 01:04:35.769
His father worked in the mine,
until it closed down

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:39.036
and he drank himself to death.

01:04:39.038 --> 01:04:40.804
Diablo hates this town.

01:04:42.306 --> 01:04:45.038
I heard him say
you were a Marine.

01:04:47.439 --> 01:04:48.704
Ex.

01:04:49.771 --> 01:04:51.936
No such thing.

01:04:59.172 --> 01:05:00.604
How'd you know?

01:05:02.306 --> 01:05:03.871
I was Force Recon.

01:05:05.671 --> 01:05:06.904
Semper Fi.

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:10.637
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

01:05:12.306 --> 01:05:13.306
I am.

01:05:19.039 --> 01:05:21.837
Matt.
Daddy had a radio.

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:23.039
An old ham rig.

01:05:24.139 --> 01:05:26.270
It's still in his office.

01:05:26.272 --> 01:05:30.137
But you can't contact
the state police on it.

01:05:30.139 --> 01:05:33.738
You don't have to. Just another
ham operator and they can.

01:05:42.206 --> 01:05:43.206
All right.

01:05:44.839 --> 01:05:46.270
I'm gonna go.

01:05:57.039 --> 01:05:59.736
Matt, come in.
Do you read me?

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:00.738
Where are you?

01:07:12.073 --> 01:07:13.706
Grunt or pogue?

01:07:15.773 --> 01:07:18.771
0311, rifleman.

01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:20.737
You took an oath once.

01:07:20.739 --> 01:07:22.305
You joined a brotherhood

01:07:22.307 --> 01:07:25.238
bound by honor, loyalty,
and blood.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.671
Do you recall them?

01:07:27.673 --> 01:07:29.073
Yes, I do.

01:07:39.307 --> 01:07:41.940
I'm giving you a choice, Marine.

01:07:55.373 --> 01:07:58.071
There's one in the pipe.

01:07:58.073 --> 01:08:00.340
But I'm reminding you,
you're still under arrest.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.940
Yes, sir.

01:08:28.372 --> 01:08:30.671
Any station, any station.

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:31.904
This is Horse Cave

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:32.971
Deputy Marshal
Matt Reynolds here.

01:08:32.974 --> 01:08:33.974
Do you copy?

01:08:37.073 --> 01:08:39.703
Any station, any station.
This is Horse Cave

01:08:39.706 --> 01:08:41.272
Deputy Marshal
Matt Reynolds here.

01:08:41.274 --> 01:08:43.872
- Do you copy?
- <i>Horse Cave,</i>

01:08:43.874 --> 01:08:45.904
<i>this is AQI 709
out in Columbus.</i>

01:08:45.907 --> 01:08:47.139
<i>What can I help you with,
Deputy?</i>

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.072
Columbus, we need back up.

01:08:49.073 --> 01:08:50.872
Multiple suspects,
heavily armed.

01:08:50.874 --> 01:08:52.874
Please send reinforcements.
Do you copy?

01:09:08.774 --> 01:09:09.774
Go ahead.

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:40.308
Fall back.

01:09:51.241 --> 01:09:52.841
Where are you heading, Marshal?

01:09:53.907 --> 01:09:55.142
You can't run.

01:10:02.408 --> 01:10:03.807
Marshal.

01:10:42.109 --> 01:10:44.706
Come on, come on, come on.

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:46.439
Hurry up, guys.
Come on.

01:12:56.343 --> 01:12:57.943
Diablo, we got to go.

01:13:10.343 --> 01:13:12.108
Come on, Diablo.
We got to go.

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:14.108
We're good.
We're good. Last ones.

01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:15.707
Come on.

01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:45.974
Well, the state police
are coming.

01:13:45.976 --> 01:13:47.074
How do you know that?

01:13:47.076 --> 01:13:48.174
It's all over the radio.

01:13:48.176 --> 01:13:50.143
- You got to go.
- All right.

01:13:54.009 --> 01:13:55.775
Trixie.

01:13:55.777 --> 01:13:56.875
Trixie.

01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:22.274
Trixie.

01:16:07.211 --> 01:16:08.277
Come on.

01:16:09.412 --> 01:16:10.644
Fuck.

01:16:59.744 --> 01:17:00.876
Are you okay?

01:17:00.878 --> 01:17:01.943
Yeah.

01:17:01.945 --> 01:17:03.243
Are you good?

01:17:03.245 --> 01:17:04.709
I believe
there is only one guy left.

01:17:04.711 --> 01:17:07.676
So, it should be
a piece of cake.

01:17:07.678 --> 01:17:08.811
Just in case.

01:17:17.145 --> 01:17:18.378
It was my daddy's.

01:17:25.745 --> 01:17:26.978
You think of
everything, don't you?

01:17:52.413 --> 01:17:53.645
I got to go.

01:17:56.212 --> 01:17:57.645
I need you to stay safe.

01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:00.612
Yah.

01:18:03.811 --> 01:18:05.045
Yah, yah, yah.

01:19:08.712 --> 01:19:10.379
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:19:51.214 --> 01:19:53.180
You have a better shot nowadays.

01:19:55.046 --> 01:19:57.212
You know who's gonna be happy?

01:19:57.214 --> 01:20:00.380
Your deputy,
if he's ever taken hostage.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.280
You enjoy killing
innocent people?

01:20:05.779 --> 01:20:07.312
No, man.

01:20:07.314 --> 01:20:09.844
It breaks my fucking heart.

01:20:09.846 --> 01:20:10.879
You?

01:20:13.147 --> 01:20:15.280
I enjoy bringing justice
to those who deserve it.

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.380
Because now you're gonna kill
a man at point blank range?

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.214
That's justice.

01:20:40.314 --> 01:20:41.780
Maybe.

01:21:38.048 --> 01:21:39.146
Well, hello, Mr. Mayor.

01:21:39.148 --> 01:21:40.778
Linda.

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:41.913
Hey, Jerry.

01:21:44.448 --> 01:21:46.113
Well, good morning Mayor.

01:21:46.115 --> 01:21:47.115
Ma'am.

01:21:48.415 --> 01:21:50.179
What about breakfast?

01:21:50.181 --> 01:21:51.778
The usual?

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:54.348
No reason to change something
if it's good.

01:21:56.315 --> 01:21:59.215
So are we gonna
go riding tonight?

01:22:01.248 --> 01:22:04.046
Those horses
getting antsy again?

01:22:04.048 --> 01:22:05.048
Maybe.
