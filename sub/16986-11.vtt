00:38.914 --> 00:41.500
You're doing great in school, Eep.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.127
Oh, and a smiley in grunting.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.963
[clears throat]

00:46.046 --> 00:49.591
[grunting]

00:50.092 --> 00:52.386
Uh, it's a dead language, I'm telling you.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.845
Thunk, where are your marks?

00:53.929 --> 00:56.098
[chewing] What marks?

00:56.223 --> 00:58.308
[chewing, grunting]

00:58.392 --> 00:59.685
[gagging]

00:59.768 --> 01:01.478
[choking]

01:02.813 --> 01:06.066
Oh, Thunk,
I'm sure it's not that bad.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.276
[screams]

01:07.734 --> 01:10.737
How could you have gotten
an "incomplete" in Not Dying?

01:10.821 --> 01:12.906
I really tried to die. I did.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.200
I'm just...
I'm no good at anything.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.702
[shrieks, grunts]

01:16.785 --> 01:19.329
You're good at hurting yourself.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.831
[sighs]

01:20.914 --> 01:23.792
Honey, you'll find something
you're great at.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.877
Someday. Don't ask when.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.880
But tonight, as a reward
for Eep's great marks,

01:28.964 --> 01:31.258
how 'bout we all go to the Laughing Pit?

01:31.341 --> 01:34.011
Amber's doing that
whole "telling jokes" thing

01:34.094 --> 01:35.512
that always cheers us hunters up

01:35.595 --> 01:39.182
when someone moves away
into the belly of an animal.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.518
Eh, I also failed at cheering up.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.937
What? That can't be... wow.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.981
Didn't even know that was a subject.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.941
Uh, let's go.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.111
[crowd laughing]

01:52.404 --> 01:55.532
Why did bear owl cross valley?

01:55.616 --> 01:59.453
To get to other side and eat family.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.206
Amber says what I only think.

02:03.290 --> 02:07.169
[sighs] Glad you like it,
because I don't get any of it.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.253
What?
Amber's hilarious.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.214
Do you got something in your ears?

02:11.298 --> 02:14.134
Just the usual protective gunk.

02:14.217 --> 02:19.973
Now, see, Mom, it's funny because
bear owls do eat families.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.350
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

02:21.433 --> 02:25.520
I understand Amber's jokes.
I just don't find them funny, is all.

02:25.604 --> 02:29.358
How many gatherers
it take to kill bear owl?

02:29.441 --> 02:32.903
Eight hundred, because gatherers weak
and no hunt well.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.613
[guffawing]

02:34.696 --> 02:35.530
[groans]

02:35.614 --> 02:39.576
Gatherers are usually quite strong despite
their mostly frail bodies.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.871
Oh, we have gatherer here tonight.

02:42.954 --> 02:47.250
Hey, Amber no go where you work
and knock tiny fruit out your hand.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.835
[chuckles] Am Amber right?

02:50.629 --> 02:51.671
Wow!

02:51.755 --> 02:54.800
Must feel good to make people laugh,
and on purpose.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.386
I can almost picture myself up there.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.931
Thunk tell chickuna it taste bad.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.849
Chickuna ask for second opinion.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.936
Thunk say, "Okay, you smell bad, too."

03:06.019 --> 03:08.021
[laughing]

03:09.106 --> 03:10.148
[sighs]

03:10.982 --> 03:12.484
Thank you for coming.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.569
Amber, out.

03:14.653 --> 03:15.821
Guys, guys.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.489
I think I have a joke.

03:17.572 --> 03:20.784
[clears throat] What did the mosquitoad
say to the hunting rock?

03:20.867 --> 03:23.537
We gotta stop beating like this.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.955
[guffaws]

03:25.038 --> 03:26.915
Oh, see?

03:26.998 --> 03:30.877
That is funny, and without being mean.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.712
[gasps]
This could be what I'm good at!

03:32.796 --> 03:34.089
Take that, school!

03:34.172 --> 03:36.383
I didn't even need to pass "Not Dying."

03:36.466 --> 03:38.677
[grunts, sighs]

03:40.637 --> 03:42.889
Oh, man,
I love that joke where you were like,

03:42.973 --> 03:45.392
- "That not mouth."
- Uh...

03:45.475 --> 03:48.770
Amber jokes better
when Amber say them.

03:48.854 --> 03:49.730
[gasps]

03:49.813 --> 03:51.231
You made fun of me.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.899
[chuckles] I'm honored.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.151
Great show, Amber.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.737
Killer jokes,
especially the ones about killing.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.573
Amber talk about what Amber know.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.743
Any chance I could try telling jokes
at the Laughing Pit, too?

04:02.826 --> 04:03.952
That depend.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.621
Grug son have one chance
to make Amber laugh.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.123
- Go!
- Now?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.082
Here?

04:09.166 --> 04:10.167
Okay. Sure.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.127
Uh... there are three pig rats.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.336
No! Two pig rats.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.337
No, three.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.132
And... and you don't know
that they're pig rats yet.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.048
[sighs]

04:18.132 --> 04:20.343
Let me try again.
But first, do you know Womp?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.972
Oh, kinda need to know Womp for that joke.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.474
- One joke, one joke.
- [buzzing]

04:25.557 --> 04:26.558
Got it!

04:26.641 --> 04:27.976
What did the...
[gags]

04:28.059 --> 04:29.394
- [choking]
- Yeah.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.147
Grug son never perform
at the Laughing Pit.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.566
[chuckles]
Maybe Grug son try Choke Hole.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.778
[chuckles] Amber joking.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.280
Grug son never perform anywhere.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.783
[gasping]

04:42.866 --> 04:44.701
[chuckling] Oh, boy!

04:44.785 --> 04:46.953
She really tells it like it is.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.037
[sighs]

04:48.538 --> 04:51.625
I could be good at jokes
if Amber gave me another shot.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.126
What do I do?

04:53.210 --> 04:56.171
I'm not talking to myself.
I really need advice, Sandy.

04:56.713 --> 04:57.714
Sandy?

04:57.798 --> 04:58.882
[growls]

05:00.467 --> 05:01.635
[shrieks]

05:01.718 --> 05:03.470
These bones want revenge.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.055
Please, don't eat me.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.015
I didn't even like the way
your meat tasted.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.602
- [giggling]
- Oh, it's just you, Sandy.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.355
[as puppet]
"You made me sound like I was alive."

05:13.438 --> 05:16.107
- [laughs]
- You think I'm funny?

05:16.191 --> 05:19.444
- 'Cause the last guy thought I was tasty.
- [giggling]

05:19.528 --> 05:23.073
You know, if Amber won't listen
to Thunk Crood, maybe she'll listen to...

05:23.156 --> 05:25.575
[as puppet] Me, Funk Rood,
all-around funny guy.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.078
- Ooga booga!
- [laughs, clapping]

05:30.121 --> 05:33.166
Uh, Amber no like prop comedy.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.880
[shudders]
It actually in there.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.174
- Take half day tomorrow.
- Thank you.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.551
Not everything's a joke.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.262
[sighs] I'm so nervous.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.764
You think you got problems?
I don't even have skin.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.933
[laughs] You're always on.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.185
I'll never get tired of that. Let's go!

05:52.269 --> 05:54.187
[clears throat] Sorry about that.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.982
Tough to clear your throat when some
caveman ate it for breakfast.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.525
[guffawing]

05:58.608 --> 06:01.069
You said it, talking skull.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.989
Seriously, my parents used to say
I was skin and bones.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.615
Now I'm just bones. Ooga booga!

06:05.699 --> 06:06.950
[laughing]

06:09.077 --> 06:09.995
[laughing]

06:10.078 --> 06:12.122
Ever notice how hunters talk like this:

06:12.205 --> 06:13.290
"Hey, how you doin'?"

06:13.373 --> 06:17.043
But gatherers talk like this:
"Duh, I got fruit!"

06:20.547 --> 06:21.464
Duh.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.800
[imitating] Anyone can do silly voices.

06:23.883 --> 06:27.053
Mom, please.
Leave the jokes to the professionals.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.179
[sighs]

06:28.263 --> 06:30.223
Hey, who's got two thumbs
and a full belly?

06:30.307 --> 06:31.891
The guy who ate my thumbs!

06:31.975 --> 06:34.102
[laughing]

06:34.185 --> 06:37.397
See? Making people laugh is
what I'm good at.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.857
Take that, earlier Thunk

06:38.940 --> 06:40.942
who didn't think he was
good at anything. Ow!

06:41.026 --> 06:42.652
[laughing]

06:42.736 --> 06:44.571
[crickets chirping]

06:45.530 --> 06:46.531
Funk, Funk!

06:46.615 --> 06:49.200
[crowd chanting]
Funk, Funk, Funk, Funk, Funk!

06:49.284 --> 06:51.786
Are you saying,
"Thunk, Thunk, Thunk"?

06:51.870 --> 06:54.623
[chanting]
No, no, no, no, no!

06:54.706 --> 06:57.292
It's like they don't get that I am Funk.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.336
Because you're not. But don't worry.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.880
We're a team.
The brains and the beauty.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.423
And you. Ooga booga!

07:03.506 --> 07:05.634
[crowd laughing]

07:05.717 --> 07:07.385
Anyone here from Ahhh! Valley?

07:07.469 --> 07:09.054
[cheering]

07:09.971 --> 07:11.431
Those who can't do, teach.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.850
And those who are too lazy to teach
are named Squawk.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.810
- Ooga Booga!
- [guffawing]

07:16.478 --> 07:18.271
Uh, mind if we get a picture?

07:18.355 --> 07:19.731
Uh, sure. Yeah.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.317
Uh, no. Who are you?
I'm talking to the funny one.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.155
[Grug] How was your day, son?

07:27.238 --> 07:28.406
Not great.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.493
Oh, I was talking to my other son, Funk.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.079
Um, you don't mind if I call you son,
do you?

07:34.162 --> 07:36.164
You don't mind if I call you ugly, do you?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.751
This guy...

07:41.086 --> 07:42.587
Wait. I know this meat.

07:42.671 --> 07:43.964
I used to be this meat.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.303
[yelps]

07:50.387 --> 07:52.180
[impact grunts]

07:54.057 --> 07:55.225
Ow!

07:56.935 --> 07:57.978
Mom?

07:58.061 --> 07:59.479
You're missing Funk.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.148
[Grug]
Funk's "playing dead" bit is so funny!

08:02.232 --> 08:05.360
- It's like he's really dead!
- [everyone laughs]

08:05.443 --> 08:09.614
[groans] I know everyone
finds Funk funny, but not me.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.993
He's loud and obnoxious and the whole
making jokes about death thing?

08:13.076 --> 08:14.327
Death isn't funny.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.578
I for one agree.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.205
[screams]

08:17.288 --> 08:19.874
Thunk, maybe I don't know jokes,

08:19.958 --> 08:24.087
but I know you, and you are
a lot funnier than that jerk skull.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.632
- [all laughing]
- [Eep] Funk, you're hilarious.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.343
You are Funk Rood, right?

08:30.427 --> 08:31.803
[sighs] I am and I'm not.

08:31.886 --> 08:35.181
But yeah, I got into this
to make people laugh, at me.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.975
And that's what I'm going to do.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.852
[grunting]

08:38.934 --> 08:40.352
[screams]

08:41.938 --> 08:43.481
[chuckling]

08:44.107 --> 08:46.948
Hey, Ugga, you gotta see Funk's
impression of you at the Laughing Pit.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.574
[chuckling]
Oh, man, he's got you down.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.950
[groans]

08:54.034 --> 08:59.581
Straight from belly of bear owl,
Funk Rood!

08:59.664 --> 09:02.459
[sighing] The chickuna
asks for a second opinion,

09:02.542 --> 09:05.211
so I say, "Okay, you smell bad, too."

09:05.295 --> 09:07.589
[chuckles, sighs]

09:09.716 --> 09:12.260
Hey, where Grug son going?

09:12.343 --> 09:14.554
Grug son going to tell jokes.

09:14.637 --> 09:18.099
[laughs] That funniest thing
Grug son ever say.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.977
- [gasps]
- But still not very funny.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.438
You no take stage ever.
Where Funk?

09:23.521 --> 09:24.521
Funk's not here tonight.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.232
Oh, yeah? Then where am I?

09:26.316 --> 09:28.943
[yelping]
How did you even get here?

09:29.027 --> 09:30.445
I've always been here.

09:30.528 --> 09:34.115
- [screams]
- You forgot Funk, Thunk.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.785
Hey, your names rhyme.

09:36.868 --> 09:39.079
[chuckling] There a joke in that?

09:39.162 --> 09:41.790
That one's free, on me.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.249
Come on, you wanted laughs?

09:43.333 --> 09:45.168
I'm getting them.
Where's the problem?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.711
I wanted to be good at something.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.130
Me, not some skull on my hand.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.632
You are good at something.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.509
You do that great impression of a dummy.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.592
[growls]

09:53.635 --> 09:55.595
That's it! [grunting]

09:55.678 --> 09:57.764
Stop hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.766
Stop hitting yourself,
stop hitting yourself.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.644
You stop hitting yourself!
Oh, wait, I control you.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.062
[gasps]

10:04.145 --> 10:06.606
- Is this a bit?
- This isn't what I wanted.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.150
Maybe I'm not good at making people laugh.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.318
Don't look at me.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.861
I'm just your anxiety talking.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.280
Everybody, I'm...

10:14.364 --> 10:16.282
[screaming]

10:16.366 --> 10:18.701
[grunting]

10:18.785 --> 10:19.869
[screaming]

10:24.457 --> 10:26.126
[sighs] Oh!

10:26.209 --> 10:28.211
I'm...
[screaming]

10:28.294 --> 10:30.839
[grunting]

10:33.800 --> 10:35.760
[sighs] Oh, I'm...

10:35.844 --> 10:37.053
[grunting]

10:37.137 --> 10:38.847
I'm okay.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.390
[crickets chirping]

10:41.474 --> 10:43.017
[guffawing]

10:43.101 --> 10:45.770
[crowd laughing]

10:45.854 --> 10:49.065
Now that was funny.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.942
Our son hurt himself...

10:51.025 --> 10:52.527
And survived!

10:52.610 --> 10:54.279
So funny!

10:57.657 --> 11:01.619
Grug son fall, make Amber laugh.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.498
That funniest thing Amber ever see.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.583
[chuckles] Really?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.168
Me? Grug son?

11:08.251 --> 11:10.128
Yeah!

11:10.211 --> 11:12.630
Grug son even funnier than Funk.

11:12.714 --> 11:16.467
Funk over-rely on catchphrase,
"Ooga booga."

11:17.176 --> 11:19.721
Grug son rely on pain!

11:19.804 --> 11:21.514
Much funnier!

11:22.765 --> 11:23.766
[sighs]

11:25.935 --> 11:28.021
You're gonna live with me now, Funk.

11:30.732 --> 11:31.983
You've still got it.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.192
Ooga booga!

11:44.203 --> 11:45.121
See?

11:45.204 --> 11:49.334
First the buffalippo smell
to find out if they like each other.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.629
[sniffing]

11:52.712 --> 11:56.716
[Ugga] Ooh, he is really sniffing up
what she's sweating out.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.968
Then they do a courtship dance,

11:59.052 --> 12:03.973
ending with them touching horns,
which means they're mates forever.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.350
Aww!

12:05.433 --> 12:06.726
Or until we eat them.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.144
[groans]

12:20.782 --> 12:21.866
Hey!

12:21.950 --> 12:24.577
That other male's
trying to jerk them apart.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.828
Well, sure, sweetie.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.455
Every species has jerks.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.168
[chuckles]
Beat it, jerkalippo.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.671
Looks like love wins again.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.381
- Hey.
- Kevin?

12:36.464 --> 12:39.133
You watch animal courtships?

12:39.217 --> 12:42.345
Yeah, but I think of it as watching two
hearts become one.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.514
Isn't nature so beautiful?

12:48.518 --> 12:53.648
But the reason I'm here now is to ask you
out to a romantic sunset dinner, Eep.

12:53.731 --> 12:57.652
My mom will have to catch and kill
the prey for us, but still...

12:58.236 --> 12:59.516
- [birds chirping]
- Sorry, what?

12:59.570 --> 13:02.407
All I hear is birds singing
as if for the first time.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.243
Oh, I said I came to ask you on a date.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.662
[squeals]
Oh, Kevin.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.914
A thousand times yes...

13:09.998 --> 13:13.793
Eep, you are not going out
on a date with him, and that is final.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.504
- But, but, I... I'm cute.
- No, nope. Forget it.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.172
Don't even make eye contact.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.549
Hey.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.884
Okay, I'll go.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.636
But I'll never forget you, Eep.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.767
- Hey, Mal, wanna go on a date?
- Me? Am I Mal?

13:29.851 --> 13:32.270
I am Mal!
Yes, yes!

13:32.353 --> 13:34.480
[giggling]

13:34.564 --> 13:39.777
Well, I'd say I handled that, uh, what's a
word that means better than perfect?

13:39.861 --> 13:42.280
[snarling]

13:42.363 --> 13:45.658
Eep, I can see you're angry,
but I know what is best for you.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.076
Kevin is no good.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.370
He's the kind of jerk I was talking about.

13:49.454 --> 13:52.040
And you're not gonna change my mind
by foaming at the mouth.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.916
- [shouts]
- [shrieking]

13:54.917 --> 13:56.919
Just go to the hunt, Grug, and run!

13:57.003 --> 13:58.254
- [Eep snarling]
- No, Ugga.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.338
If I show fear now,

13:59.422 --> 14:01.302
then any time I do something
she doesn't like,

14:01.340 --> 14:02.508
she'll think I'll just...

14:02.592 --> 14:03.760
- [growls]
- [shrieks]

14:04.177 --> 14:05.178
[grunting]

14:07.889 --> 14:10.058
Okay, I'm calm.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.601
You can get off now.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.104
[scoffs] Nice try, but your hackles
haven't even gone down.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.190
[hissing]

14:17.273 --> 14:18.524
[bellowing]

14:18.608 --> 14:20.651
- Huh?
- [bellowing continues]

14:22.945 --> 14:24.113
Hey, look.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.075
The buffalippos are getting ready
to touch horns.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.701
- Aww.
- Aww.

14:28.785 --> 14:29.786
Wait.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.788
Am I old enough to see this?

14:35.917 --> 14:38.127
Yes, yes.
Be with him!

14:38.211 --> 14:39.796
Be with your Kevin.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.882
Before your heartless
buffalippo father ruins it.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.385
Eep, your dad was only
looking out for you.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.886
He's not heartless.

14:46.969 --> 14:51.099
He's actually a sweet
and gentle caveman, who...

14:51.182 --> 14:52.600
Kill the meat, kill the meat!

14:52.683 --> 14:55.645
With the worst timing possible.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.605
[screaming]

14:57.688 --> 14:59.107
No!

14:59.190 --> 15:01.943
He can't destroy another young romance.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.153
Not for some stupid meal.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.655
Wait, Eep, no!

15:06.989 --> 15:08.533
Kids, stop!

15:08.616 --> 15:12.412
Eep, Thunk, do you not hear me
using my Mom voice?

15:13.162 --> 15:16.374
Or have you realized it's an empty threat
with no real power to control you?

15:17.083 --> 15:21.045
Well, it's all I got, so you
come back here right now!

15:21.129 --> 15:23.172
[groans]
I'm going home.

15:27.510 --> 15:28.719
[panting]

15:28.803 --> 15:29.637
Careful, Munk.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.181
Make sure you have a clear shot
before you throw.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.433
You got it, buddy.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.756
[imitating Grug]
Just kidding.

15:34.809 --> 15:35.893
Throw now!

15:35.977 --> 15:37.061
You got it, buddy.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.063
Wait.
I didn't say that... ow!

15:39.147 --> 15:40.857
[grunts]

15:40.940 --> 15:42.650
Guys, what are you doing?

15:42.733 --> 15:44.527
That was going to be our dinner!

15:44.610 --> 15:46.195
And my new head hair.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.660
She just fell in love!

15:52.743 --> 15:56.122
And I'm not letting you
crush her dreams, Dad!

15:56.205 --> 15:59.792
We're not trying to crush her dreams,
just her entire body!

15:59.876 --> 16:01.544
Buffalippos have dreams?

16:01.627 --> 16:02.628
Huh.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.672
I wonder if they're the same as mine.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.800
[thunder rumbling]

16:09.343 --> 16:11.471
That's it. Run, girl!

16:11.554 --> 16:14.390
No one can stop you
from reaching your one and only.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.308
[panting]

16:15.391 --> 16:16.434
Love makes you brave.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.977
Love makes you strong.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.645
Love makes you go number one.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.315
No! Don't stop!

16:22.398 --> 16:23.983
Hunters are coming!

16:24.066 --> 16:25.985
[Grug]
We are right on your tail...

16:26.068 --> 16:27.737
[stammers]
wherever you are!

16:27.820 --> 16:29.447
Fine, fine, you did your thing.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.032
Now let's, uh...

16:31.115 --> 16:32.950
Oh, come on!

16:33.993 --> 16:35.369
Move!

16:35.453 --> 16:36.829
Do it for true love!

16:36.913 --> 16:37.997
[bellowing]

16:38.080 --> 16:40.791
[shouts, grunts]

16:40.875 --> 16:43.169
She's being difficult.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.754
Can't say I blame her.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.130
These are delicious.

16:47.798 --> 16:52.178
Which means we need something
even tastier to lead her away.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.763
And I know just the thing.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.559
Oh, buffalippo.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.311
Dinner's served.

17:00.394 --> 17:03.898
If I were you, I'd start here
and eat to the top,

17:03.981 --> 17:06.317
where you'll find a tiny surprise...

17:06.400 --> 17:07.484
my brain.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.653
Mmm.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.323
[screaming]

17:12.573 --> 17:14.867
- [grunting]
- [straining]

17:18.412 --> 17:19.329
What gives?

17:19.413 --> 17:22.083
I'm offering you
the meal of a lifetime here.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.834
Now eat!

17:26.295 --> 17:29.257
- [grunts]
- Food isn't the answer, Thunk.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.635
Romance is out there waiting for her.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.846
We just have to get her to hear its call.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.516
Okay, Munk, set your rock to stun.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.978
And fast! Thunk, go hide and lure her
with a buffalippo mating call.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.146
Me?
Why would I be able to do that?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.815
'Cause it's weird, and you're Thunk.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.191
[chuckles]
Hey, yeah.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.026
Watch and learn.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.989
[wailing]

17:57.243 --> 17:58.369
Wrong call, wrong call.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.996
Yeah, it was more like, um...

18:00.079 --> 18:02.290
[howling]

18:03.958 --> 18:06.127
[growling]

18:06.210 --> 18:08.296
[hissing]

18:13.467 --> 18:15.469
[sighs] Maybe it's more like...

18:15.553 --> 18:17.305
- [buffalippo bellowing]
- [gasping]

18:19.432 --> 18:21.309
[gasps]
Her Kevin!

18:25.730 --> 18:26.606
[laughing]

18:26.689 --> 18:27.689
[shouts, grunts]

18:28.232 --> 18:29.859
Have fun finding your love.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.903
But you'll never find a meal
as good as me ever again.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.405
Time to bonk some prey!

18:34.488 --> 18:36.115
Aw, it's just my son.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.491
Well, dinner's dinner.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.246
[sighs]

18:42.330 --> 18:44.206
I just cannot get eaten today.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.167
[panting]
Almost there.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.044
This is all I've ever wanted.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.921
[stammering]
I mean, you've ever wanted.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.181
[gasps]
No!

19:00.264 --> 19:01.515
No, stop!

19:01.599 --> 19:03.267
That's not your Kevin.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.194
[grunts]
No!

19:13.277 --> 19:14.195
No way.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.358
You are not going with this jerk,
and that's final.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.407
[nervous chuckling]

19:18.491 --> 19:22.328
And by jerk,
I was just "jerking" around.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.331
[chuckles]

19:25.414 --> 19:27.208
[bellowing]

19:27.291 --> 19:30.961
[screams]

19:31.045 --> 19:33.547
[panting]

19:36.509 --> 19:38.302
[screams]

19:39.512 --> 19:41.430
Eep!
Are you okay?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.974
No, I'm mad.
Can't she see this guy's no good?

19:45.935 --> 19:49.188
And I'm just trying to look out for her.
[winces] Oh.

19:49.271 --> 19:53.317
I guess that's all you were trying
to do for me, weren't you, Dad?

19:55.152 --> 19:56.487
[panting]

19:56.570 --> 19:58.906
Help!

19:59.240 --> 20:01.367
Hey, don't throw that rock, Munk.
You might hit Eep.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.454
No, don't throw that rock, either.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.872
[bellowing]
[Eep screaming]

20:06.956 --> 20:08.332
I've got a better idea.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.003
Yoo-hoo!

20:13.587 --> 20:15.923
Loverboy!

20:17.466 --> 20:19.593
Graze this field often?

20:19.677 --> 20:22.179
Dad?
I don't think he's into you.

20:22.263 --> 20:24.724
[exclaiming]

20:25.558 --> 20:28.018
Um...
[chuckling]

20:28.811 --> 20:31.355
But he's definitely on to you.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.898
[shrieking]

20:35.359 --> 20:36.944
[screaming]

20:38.154 --> 20:39.739
[straining]

20:41.991 --> 20:42.991
[panting]

20:48.664 --> 20:49.582
[straining]

20:49.665 --> 20:50.583
Pucker up.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.251
[buffalippos bellowing]

20:56.255 --> 20:58.507
- Dad!
- Eep!

20:59.467 --> 21:00.885
Tree!

21:01.427 --> 21:02.845
[moaning]

21:03.387 --> 21:05.931
Sorry I foamed at the mouth
at you, Dad.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.349
No, it's all right.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.518
I overreacted when Kevin asked you out.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.563
I should've known
you'd learn the lesson yourself...

21:12.646 --> 21:14.774
after we both nearly died.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.859
Well, at least everything's settled now.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.153
- [stomach growling]
- Almost everything.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.071
[buffalippo grunting]

21:21.947 --> 21:23.616
Eh.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.374
[Eep clears throat]

21:34.460 --> 21:37.171
Go ahead, you crazy kids.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.802
Looks like love wins again...

21:42.885 --> 21:44.595
again.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.222
What are you doing here?

21:46.305 --> 21:47.848
Asking you out on a date.

21:47.932 --> 21:51.477
Only this time, we won't let your
heartless father come between us.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.646
What about your date with Mal?

21:53.729 --> 21:56.023
Oh, that? That was amazing.

21:56.106 --> 21:56.941
Ready to go?

21:57.024 --> 21:59.193
[laughs]

21:59.276 --> 22:00.820
You know what, Kevin?

22:00.903 --> 22:02.988
My dad isn't heartless.

22:03.072 --> 22:03.989
You are.

22:04.073 --> 22:07.368
So take a hike, jerkalippo.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.620
But... but... but I'm...

22:09.703 --> 22:10.746
I'm cute.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.122
Hey, but...

22:12.206 --> 22:13.958
[whimpering]

22:16.836 --> 22:17.836
[sniffing]

22:17.878 --> 22:19.338
[wincing]

22:20.506 --> 22:21.506
[whimpering]

22:25.386 --> 22:28.347
Aw! Pretty sweet. Huh, Dad?

22:28.430 --> 22:29.723
It sure is, honey.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.600
[stomach growling]

22:32.685 --> 22:34.937
Now how about we go hunt
some lonely animals?

22:35.020 --> 22:37.189
Yeah. I am starving.
