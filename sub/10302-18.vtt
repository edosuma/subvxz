02:15.800 --> 02:20.271
Well, here we are, my dear.
"Casa de Bundy."

02:21.640 --> 02:24.916
Otherwise known as
"Home of the Whopper."

02:26.120 --> 02:28.634
I don't know, Bud.
What if your parents come in?

02:28.880 --> 02:31.155
Relax, babe. They're in Milwaukee.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.397
It's the first stop
on Oprah's "Fatapalooza Tour."

02:34.800 --> 02:37.997
They're displaying the weight she lost
in giant glass jars.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.874
Many giant glass jars.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.758
They've taken the Dodge.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.433
Actually, it's "Dodgenstein."

02:44.680 --> 02:47.114
Made from the parts
of other dead Dodges.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.959
Now...

02:55.560 --> 02:59.189
Now, what say me and you
slip out of these dry clothes...

02:59.440 --> 03:01.874
...and into a wet me and you.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.038
But what if your sister comes in?

03:05.520 --> 03:09.035
I wouldn't worry about her.
I've given her a little task.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.751
Waldo?

03:18.360 --> 03:22.592
Okay, he's not in the garage.
That much we know.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.594
And you just keep looking, Kel.
You're doing a great job.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.359
I know. Maybe he's upstairs.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.519
Maybe so. Maybe no.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.638
That's what makes finding Waldo
such a great game.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.510
Yeah, well, he can run
but he can't hide.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.239
Because no one can outsmart me...

03:37.480 --> 03:39.789
...once I start using
the old grey mattress.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.153
That's my sister, Kelly.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.834
She's very special.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.950
Now, where were we?

03:54.320 --> 03:55.992
I'm scared, Bud.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.357
I mean, you don't know
how strict my dad is.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.070
Last time I got caught like this,
I was grounded for six months...

04:03.320 --> 04:05.515
...and the team couldn't go
to the Rose Bowl.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.198
We can't get caught. Come here.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.833
Listen, why don't we put
those pretty little lips...

04:18.079 --> 04:21.038
...to something more useful, like me.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.639
Lisa Pruner. I am telling your father.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.669
Can't get caught, huh?

04:56.240 --> 04:59.516
Women. Can't live with them...

04:59.800 --> 05:01.392
...the end.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.514
What happened to the tour?

05:04.760 --> 05:07.399
Well, your father hit a speed bump...

05:07.640 --> 05:10.677
...and the Dodge couldn't make it
to the top.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.073
It was awful, Bud.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.834
We rolled backwards, uncontrollably.

05:16.080 --> 05:19.789
Sometimes reaching speeds
upwards of two miles an hour.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.838
Fortunately we were jolted to a halt
by an anthill...

05:25.080 --> 05:27.674
...which survived the impact.

05:28.680 --> 05:32.355
You know, Peg, I'm starting to sense
you're not too fond of the Dodge.

05:33.880 --> 05:37.668
No, Al. I'm not too fond
of war and injustice.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.956
I freaking hate the Dodge.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.079
Now, look,
I know I've said this before...

05:44.320 --> 05:46.197
...but this time I'm serious.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.476
I want you to sell that car.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.278
Sell the Dodge?

05:50.520 --> 05:52.078
My Dodge?

05:52.320 --> 05:53.878
I will never sell the Dodge, Peg.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.839
That car's tied with some
of the great memories of my life.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.191
Who can forget the tailgate party
before the Bears' championship game?

06:00.680 --> 06:04.559
Oh, the game we missed
because the engine caught on fire?

06:05.400 --> 06:07.516
Okay, well, how about Christmas
at the lake?

06:07.840 --> 06:10.513
You mean Christmas in the lake.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.791
When the brakes failed.

06:14.400 --> 06:18.109
Fine. Well, how did you get
to the hospital when Bud was born?

06:18.360 --> 06:19.873
Taxi.

06:20.600 --> 06:25.958
And why? Because I drove
to the pool hall in the Dodge.

06:26.440 --> 06:27.759
Daddy, I need your help.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.912
Listen, I'm hot on the trail
of this weird guy named Waldo.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.752
Have you seen him?

06:42.320 --> 06:45.232
She's gonna be with us
until we die, you know.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.990
She's not important right now, Al.

06:51.240 --> 06:55.028
Now, look, what is wrong
with getting a slightly newer car?

06:55.280 --> 06:58.750
I hear they're coming with all
these new, fancy options these days.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.673
You know,
like dashboards and paint.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.277
Just more things to go wrong.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.919
Listen to me, Peg.

07:06.160 --> 07:10.039
You can nag, you can cry,
you can whinny, bleat and moo...

07:10.280 --> 07:12.669
...but I will never sell the Dodge.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.559
Finally selling the Dodge, huh?

07:17.080 --> 07:19.958
Yeah, it's like giving up
one of your children...

07:20.160 --> 07:21.957
...but none of the joy.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.192
Well, for my money you still
can't beat a European sports car.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.237
I mean, Marcie and I are nuts
about ours:

07:28.480 --> 07:31.790
Rack and pinion steering,
four-wheel independent suspension...

07:32.040 --> 07:34.508
...and 310
of the sexiest Euro-ponies...

07:34.760 --> 07:40.039
...that ever hurtled a Yankee
from 0 to 60 in under five seconds.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.879
Oh, man, what a car.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.354
- Where is it?
- It's in the shop.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.118
Still? Jefferson,
you've had the car five months.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.709
It hasn't been off the rack yet.
What's wrong with it?

07:55.960 --> 07:59.873
They don't know, but it's something
very sophisticated, very expensive...

08:00.120 --> 08:02.111
...and very, very Euro.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.828
I'm telling you,
I'm on top of the world with that car.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.878
You can ask anybody on the bus
how happy I am.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.678
So how's your ad coming?

08:13.920 --> 08:15.433
Done. Here.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.550
"Used car of indeterminate year.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.672
Forced to sell by used wife.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.877
Also of indeterminate year.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.429
Four thousand dollars"?

08:33.039 --> 08:34.313
What?

08:34.679 --> 08:37.148
You don't think I can get $4000?

08:37.679 --> 08:40.717
I don't think you could get dollars.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.638
Jefferson, let me tell you something.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.757
Waldo?

08:46.080 --> 08:48.674
Waldo?

08:53.560 --> 08:55.596
Let me tell you something.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.798
I'm a salesman.
Consequently, I know sales.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.917
Now, when this ad
hits the papers, baby...

09:01.160 --> 09:04.277
...they'll be lined up
around the block. Trust me.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.959
Hi. We're a couple of winos.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.509
We don't wanna drink and drive.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.830
So we wanna buy a Dodge.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.518
Here's your 40 bucks.

09:25.760 --> 09:26.988
Forty?

09:27.280 --> 09:29.191
It was supposed to say 4000.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.477
Hey, we're not that drunk.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.873
Does your trunk leak?

09:50.160 --> 09:52.071
We have no time to haggle.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.630
We want car
and directions to Sears Tower.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.359
Here's $40.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.748
Hi, I'm looking for a guy
named... Daddy.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.072
Oh, boy, I thought
this house looked familiar.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.076
Dodge. American motorcar.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.189
This is going well.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.314
- You know what the problem is?
- Sure.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.676
The blind don't drive.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.754
Too bad the mute don't marry.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.631
Mr. Bundy, I'm Bill Ellis
from the Dodge Corporation.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.678
We just need to verify a couple
of things about your ad.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.434
I know what you're gonna say,
but it wasn't my fault.

10:57.680 --> 11:02.629
I clearly told them,
"Seat," comma, then "belts."

11:03.920 --> 11:07.151
- Oh, that's not important.
- I didn't think so either.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.833
Come on in.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.871
Hello, ma'am.

11:13.200 --> 11:18.069
Is it true
she's gone over 999,000 miles?

11:23.520 --> 11:26.876
He means the car, you wildebeest.

11:32.760 --> 11:36.230
I'll get right to the point, Mr. Bundy.
Congratulations.

11:36.480 --> 11:40.268
It's not every day that a Dodge
reaches a million miles.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.750
This is something very special to us.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.956
You, Mr. Bundy,
are very special to us...

11:45.200 --> 11:47.714
...and we want to be there
on that momentous occasion...

11:47.920 --> 11:50.480
...when your odometer
reads all zeros.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.918
You mean,
you want us to be in a commercial?

11:54.160 --> 11:55.434
Yes.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.752
Oh, fine.
A lot of free publicity for you guys...

11:59.000 --> 12:00.513
...but what's in it for us?

12:00.880 --> 12:04.395
A 1994 Dodge Viper.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.553
Now, let me get this straight.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.598
When my Dodge
goes over a million miles...

12:24.800 --> 12:26.153
...you give me that car?

12:26.400 --> 12:30.029
Well, first we want to film your car
crossing the one-million-mile mark...

12:30.280 --> 12:34.034
...but after that, Mr. Bundy,
the Viper is yours.

12:34.960 --> 12:39.715
Oh, Peg, I'm so happy,
I could shake your hand.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.752
Al, it only has two seats.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.433
What about the kids?

12:45.880 --> 12:47.711
It's got a trunk.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.794
Bill, speaking of family...

12:50.000 --> 12:52.673
...who's gonna play my young
blond wife in the commercial?

12:52.880 --> 12:54.836
Hey, what about me?

12:55.080 --> 12:57.355
Well, you don't play my wife
in real life.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.875
And besides, you hated the Dodge.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.871
- I did not.
- Weren't you the one...

13:06.080 --> 13:08.355
...that got me the license-plate holder
that said:

13:08.560 --> 13:10.471
"I'd rather be driving"?

13:11.600 --> 13:15.149
Well, that just shows you
how close I am to the Dodge.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.436
- We kid like that all the time.
- Oh, no, Peg.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.989
You laughed at the Dodge.
You mocked the Dodge.

13:20.240 --> 13:24.028
She shot the Dodge,
but she didn't shoot the deputy.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.677
- What does that mean?
- I don't know, Peg.

13:29.880 --> 13:33.475
I'm just babbling like this
because I'm staring at her cleavage.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.713
Peggy, what's going on?

13:48.960 --> 13:53.158
Al has been driving
up and down the street for 12 hours.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.398
Well, the Dodge people told him
that when his odometer...

13:56.640 --> 14:00.269
...hit all nines to call them
and they'd send out a camera crew.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.794
So much like in bed...

14:02.040 --> 14:05.077
...AI wants to get it over with
as quickly as possible.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.075
Well, I still say a foreign car
is the way to go.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.517
You've gotta see the new pictures
they sent of ours.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.513
Here's the diagnostic crew
waving at us...

14:16.760 --> 14:20.469
...in front of the big box they're gonna
send it back to Stuttgart in.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.039
I did it, Peg.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.555
Nine hundred,
ninety-nine thousand...

14:25.800 --> 14:28.872
...nine hundred and ninety-nine
and nine tenths.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.559
The Dodge is ready
for the commercial now.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.189
I even backed it into the garage.
Think of it, Peg.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.716
Tomorrow I will drive out, Al Bundy,
old-Dodge owner...

14:44.960 --> 14:49.556
...and drive back in,
Al Bundy, Viper Man.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.869
Yeah, but the bottom line is
you'll still be Al Bundy.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.917
- Tragic, isn't it?
- Marcie, I didn't see you come in.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.799
Pull up an egg,
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.917
Al Bundy here.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.835
The mighty Dodge is at all nines.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.194
Great. See you in the morning.

15:19.680 --> 15:22.956
And now to bask
in the joys of anticipation...

15:23.200 --> 15:26.351
...sweeter, some say,
than the actual catch.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.597
You're so calm.
I mean, if it were my Dodge...

15:37.840 --> 15:41.549
...l'd be worried lightning was gonna
strike it or a tree was gonna fall on it...

15:41.800 --> 15:43.836
...even before the camera crew
could get here.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.752
I wouldn't be able to sleep a wink.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.515
And here you've got 12 hours to go
and you're not even nervous.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.959
That's the difference
between you and me, Marcie.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.918
I'm not the worrying kind.

15:55.160 --> 15:59.278
That, and if I do this,
it appears that I have breasts.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.434
You don't need to do that.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.798
Al...

16:18.640 --> 16:21.552
- What are you doing?
- That damn Marcie.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.349
She's got me so worried something's
gonna happen to the car, I can't sleep.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.553
Well, I know
what would help you sleep.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.795
Thanks, Peg, now I can't eat.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.152
This is going well.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.198
I'm surprised
you haven't called the police.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.354
Someone call the police?
We got a call about a shooting.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.999
Yes, I did, but I lied.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.151
See, I need someone
to guard the Dodge...

16:48.400 --> 16:50.960
...and a cop
is cheaper than a Doberman.

16:52.320 --> 16:57.348
Excuse me, I may need both hands
to pound this guy into hash.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.756
But if you ever take a shot
at my partner again, you're going in.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.513
Gotcha.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.627
But you don't understand.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.952
I got a terrible feeling something's
gonna happen to my Dodge.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.430
Al, how long have I known you?

17:11.680 --> 17:13.875
What? Seven, eight years?

17:14.119 --> 17:18.318
I've arrested you,
what, 11, 12 times?

17:19.319 --> 17:22.596
You're a load in my pants,
you know that, Al?

17:24.079 --> 17:26.640
No one wants your crummy car.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.111
No one even believes
this house is occupied.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.637
Now, either go to bed,
or let me blow you away...

17:33.880 --> 17:35.757
...so I can go to bed.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.231
On second thought, I gotta go.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.869
I might have left something
at the doughnut shop.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.633
Hold it.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.918
Never mind.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.670
Dad, it's 2:00 in the morning.
I gotta take some tests tomorrow.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.514
Yeah, Dad, I gotta go
to the doctor's too.

18:04.560 --> 18:08.394
Kids, or should I say,
lackeys of the red devil...

18:08.640 --> 18:10.995
...I need your help.
The Dodge is in trouble.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.196
So who hasn't been?

18:13.520 --> 18:15.636
Come, my children...
And Kelly.

18:15.840 --> 18:16.989
- to the garage.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.593
We'll guard the Dodge.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.195
We proud Bundys three
will guard against those...

18:21.440 --> 18:24.193
...who will pillage and plunder
and joyride in the Dodge.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.159
- Do we get to drive the Viper?
- No.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.632
Why should we help
guard the Dodge?

18:29.880 --> 18:32.075
Because we're family, damn it.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.514
So are the Jacksons. Good night.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.392
Fine. I'll guard the Dodge myself.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.632
Four hours.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.552
I can do that.

18:50.920 --> 18:54.799
First I'll open the garage door.
Let a little fresh air in.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.148
Or out.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.591
There's nothing like a little music
to help pass the time.

19:14.800 --> 19:18.270
Who was the genius that let
West Virginia become a state?

19:20.040 --> 19:22.110
Okay, no problem.
I'll just entertain myself...

19:22.360 --> 19:24.635
...with one of my many
challenging hobbies.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.555
Marlon Brando.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.839
Alfred Hitchcock.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.552
Elvis.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.190
"Refrigerator" Perry.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.115
Elizabeth Taylor.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.835
Six a.m. I did it!

20:12.080 --> 20:13.832
I beat the night.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.670
They'll be here pretty soon.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.036
I'll never have to work again.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.116
I'll just drive my Viper.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.352
I'll drive it here and there,
to and fro...

20:30.600 --> 20:32.033
...out and about.

20:32.280 --> 20:36.558
And to my millions of fans,
I'll be known as Le Grande Vipe.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.712
I'll be famous.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.396
I'll fight crime...

20:43.000 --> 20:46.515
...if it doesn't scratch the paint.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.753
Oh, and he was so close.
What happened?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.672
Well, he fell asleep...

21:01.920 --> 21:04.434
...and then the Dodge rolled
out of the driveway.

21:04.680 --> 21:09.595
So now the odometer reads
"000,000 and nine tenths"...

21:09.800 --> 21:13.634
...which means no commercial
and no new car.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.355
Well, how did he finally stop?

21:25.760 --> 21:28.035
Well, luckily...

21:28.280 --> 21:31.795
...there was a brand-new foreign car
parked outside...

21:32.280 --> 21:35.431
...which had finally been fixed,
but never driven.

21:36.200 --> 21:40.239
Well, it's good to get that first
broadside out of the way.

21:40.840 --> 21:44.276
We still made it over a million miles.
Aren't they gonna give him anything?

21:44.520 --> 21:48.069
Well, yeah. They gave him
a car phone as a consolation prize.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.959
And you know, there's one thing
you have to say about Al.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.988
He is determined not to let this
little setback beat him.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.674
Hello, Al? Is that you?

22:01.920 --> 22:03.797
Hello, Peg.

22:04.720 --> 22:08.429
I'm here in Burnt Scrotum,
New Mexico.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.790
And guess what.
I'm over a thousand miles, babe.

22:15.040 --> 22:18.077
I'm gonna drive until I hit
another million.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.912
And then you'll be home, Al?

22:21.160 --> 22:23.754
Then I'll be home,
and the Viper will be mine.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.231
Do you hear me? Mine, I tell you.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.517
Mine! Mine!
