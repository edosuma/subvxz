WEBVTT

00:06.477 --> 00:09.710
ARE YOU REALLY TRYING
FOR MORNING SEX?
I AM.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.543
CAN I GET ON TOP SO I DON'T
HAVE TO LOOK UP YOUR NOSE?

00:12.543 --> 00:15.146
YEP, YEP. ABSOLUTELY.

00:17.088 --> 00:18.719
MMM.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.495
I'M SORRY.
MY HEART'S NOT IN IT.

00:24.495 --> 00:26.097
OH, NO ONE CARES.

00:26.097 --> 00:28.429
EXCEPT FOR ME. I-I DO.

00:28.429 --> 00:31.302
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE SUCKED
AT MY JOB LATELY.

00:31.302 --> 00:33.334
I HAVEN'T SOLD A HOUSE
IN FOREVER,

00:33.334 --> 00:35.336
AND TODAY I HAVE TO SHOW
THIS ANNOYING COUPLE

00:35.336 --> 00:38.509
THE SAME HOUSE THAT I'VE
SHOWED THEM FIVE TIMES.

00:38.509 --> 00:40.171
YOU'RE JUST
IN A LITTLE SLUMP.

00:40.171 --> 00:41.672
YOU KNOW, ALL YOU NEED
IS, LIKE, A LITTLE PUMP-UP.

00:41.672 --> 00:43.514
YOU KNOW,
LIKE THE BOXERS GET.

00:43.514 --> 00:44.715
(boxing ring bell dings)

00:44.715 --> 00:46.117
(hip-hop music playing)

00:46.117 --> 00:47.678
(imitating boxing announcer)
AND NOW

00:47.678 --> 00:51.522
STANDING 5'6" TALL,

00:51.522 --> 00:55.426
WEIGHING IN AT EXACTLY WHAT
A WOMAN HER SIZE SHOULD WEIGH

00:55.426 --> 00:58.429
IF NOT 2 POUNDS LESS,

00:58.429 --> 01:02.193
THE ALABAMA SLAMMA--

01:02.193 --> 01:08.839
JULES "SWEET CORN ON THE" COBB.

01:08.839 --> 01:10.701
(man) в™Є I MAKE THE BALL MOVE
WHEN THEY GIVE ME A BEAT в™Є

01:10.701 --> 01:13.274
WHOO-HOO! YOU CRAZY, GIRL.
YOU CRAZY.

01:13.274 --> 01:16.807
в™Є TILL I REST IN PEACE,
FOREVER BE IN PEACE в™Є

01:16.807 --> 01:18.209
(music stops)

01:18.209 --> 01:20.751
THAT'S HOT COFFEE!
SCALDING!

01:20.751 --> 01:27.188
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:27.188 --> 01:28.659
(exhales)

01:28.659 --> 01:31.492
GAME ON, 'BAMA SLAMMA.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.793
SO...

01:32.793 --> 01:35.326
DID YOU LOVE
SEEING THE PLACE... AGAIN?

01:35.326 --> 01:37.198
OHH...
(inhales sharply) AH...

01:37.198 --> 01:39.270
WHAT DO YOU LOVE
ABOUT THE PLACE?
YEAH.

01:39.270 --> 01:41.172
IT'S GOT A GREAT LAYOUT.
IT'S GOT A YARD.

01:41.172 --> 01:42.873
OH, IT'S GOT ANOTHER YARD
IN THE BACK.

01:42.873 --> 01:44.805
WELL, THAT'S
A DOUBLE YARD THING.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.377
WHAT ABOUT THE SCHOOLS,
JERRY?

01:46.377 --> 01:48.609
YOU KNOW, ARE THE--
ARE THE SCHOOLS GOOD?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.441
THEY'RE FINE. THEY GOT
SPORTS, PREGNANT TEENS--

01:50.441 --> 01:51.842
YOU KNOW, THE USUAL.

01:51.842 --> 01:53.514
CAN WE PUT IN A JACUZZI?

01:53.514 --> 01:55.516
YOU COULD PUT IN
TEN JACUZZIS.

01:55.516 --> 01:58.319
YOU COULD TURN A WHOLE ROOM
INTO A JACUZZI.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.891
THAT'S SOMETHING
TO CONSIDER.

02:00.891 --> 02:03.454
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, COULD YOU
JUST MAKE UP YOUR MINDS?

02:03.454 --> 02:05.626
IS THAT DINING-ROOM WALL
LOAD-BEARING?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.228
I DON'T KNOW, JER.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.200
KNOCK IT DOWN
AND FIND OUT.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.202
CAN WE?
THAT'D BE GREAT.

02:12.803 --> 02:14.405
"AND THEN TERRY THE TRAIN

02:14.405 --> 02:15.906
SAID GOOD-BYE TO HIS MOMMY
AND DADDY AND..."

02:15.906 --> 02:18.169
"SET OFF FOR HIS ADVENTURE."

02:18.169 --> 02:19.540
GOOD JOB.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.871
SWEETIE, I THINK
THE PAPERBOY'S HERE.

02:20.871 --> 02:22.613
YOU WANT TO GO
THROW ROCKS AT HIM?

02:22.613 --> 02:26.577
OKAY. NOTHING BIGGER
THAN A QUARTER.

02:26.577 --> 02:29.750
(door opens and closes)
I LOVE WATCHING YOU READ
TO OUR SON.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.722
I WISH TERRY THE TRAIN
WOULD CRASH

02:31.722 --> 02:34.685
AND BURN TO DEATH
IN A FIRE.
OH, THAT'S SWEET.

02:34.685 --> 02:37.358
YOU KNOW I LOVE STAN,
BUT WE HAVE A NANNY

02:37.358 --> 02:38.859
TO GIVE HIM ALL THE LOVE
THAT I FEEL

02:38.859 --> 02:40.861
BUT DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY
TO EXPRESS.

02:40.861 --> 02:44.765
BUT ROSA JUST UP AND LEFT
FOR A VACATION IN HONDURAS.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.497
HER MOTHER DIED.

02:46.497 --> 02:48.499
LIKE SHE'S NOT GONNA
SEE FRIENDS WHEN SHE'S THERE?

02:48.499 --> 02:50.601
(imitates Spanish accent)
WAH. I MISS MY MOM.

02:50.601 --> 02:52.403
(normal voice)
PASS THE SALSA.

02:52.403 --> 02:54.805
THAT'S SELFISH, INSENSITIVE,
AND RACIST ALL AT ONCE.

02:54.805 --> 02:57.348
THE TRIFECTA!

02:57.348 --> 02:59.179
(giggles)
YEAH.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.212
(humming)

03:01.212 --> 03:02.653
STOP BEING SO HAPPY.

03:02.653 --> 03:04.485
NO.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.887
FUN AND WORK GO TOGETHER LIKE
THE NBA AND BASTARD BABIES.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.789
FUN AND WORK
DON'T GO TOGETHER.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.692
IF THEY DID,
THEY'D CALL IT... "FURK."

03:11.692 --> 03:14.895
UGH. I HAVEN'T FURKED
IN SO LONG.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.867
I WAS REALLY HOPING
YOU WOULDN'T MAKE IT A VERB,

03:16.867 --> 03:18.599
BUT THEN YOU DID.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.372
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN PAY
ATTENTION AT OPEN HOUSES.

03:21.372 --> 03:23.904
I JUST PLAY STRANGER TOUCH.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.336
(Laurie)
STRANGER TOUCH IS A GAME

03:25.336 --> 03:26.907
THAT WE INVENTED
WHEN WE WORKED TOGETHER.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.410
YOU TRY TO TOUCH A STRANGER
WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.742
I TOUCHED A COP ON THE WAY
INTO WORK YESTERDAY

03:31.742 --> 03:32.983
JUST TO FEEL SOMETHING.

03:32.983 --> 03:35.946
DO YOU NEED A HIT
OF HAPPY SAUCE?

03:37.418 --> 03:38.919
MMM.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.352
OH, THAT'S CHEAPER
THAN XANAX.

03:41.352 --> 03:42.853
I'M GONNA TAKE
ONE OF THESE HOME.

03:42.853 --> 03:44.255
YOU KNOW, WORK IS LIKE SEX.

03:44.255 --> 03:45.626
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT

03:45.626 --> 03:47.428
UNLESS YOU REALLY,
REALLY WANT TO,

03:47.428 --> 03:49.460
EVEN IF A WEALTHY
MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN

03:49.460 --> 03:51.332
IS PAYING YOU
A BUNCH OF MONEY.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.934
I MEAN, SURE, SOME PRINCE'S
BEACH COMPOUND IN YEMEN

03:53.934 --> 03:55.936
SOUNDS LIKE
A SUPER-SWEET VACAY

03:55.936 --> 03:57.708
UNTIL YOU'RE IN A HAREM

03:57.708 --> 03:59.770
WITH A DOZEN FORMER
MIDWESTERN BEAUTY QUEENS

03:59.770 --> 04:01.842
AND BLAIR
FROM "THE FACTS OF LIFE."

04:01.842 --> 04:03.243
YOU GET MY POINT?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.675
WHAT'S A YEMEN?

04:04.675 --> 04:06.977
OKAY. THE POINT IS,
WE LOVE WHAT WE DO.

04:06.977 --> 04:08.579
I MEAN, I WANT TO BE
A PHOTOGRAPHER,

04:08.579 --> 04:10.551
BUT... (chuckles)
I'D DO IT FOR FREE.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.583
ME, TOO!
WOW. I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING

04:12.583 --> 04:14.355
THAT I WOULD DO FOR FREE.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.727
MAYBE OPEN PRESENTS,
TICKLE BABIES,

04:16.727 --> 04:20.531
OH, AND SMELL MY FINGERS AFTER
I PUMP GASOLINE. (inhales)

04:20.531 --> 04:21.862
IT'S PROBABLY HARD
TO MAKE CAREERS

04:21.862 --> 04:23.294
OUT OF MOST OF THOSE THINGS.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.971
I...

04:30.971 --> 04:33.043
(both) STRANGER TOUCH.

04:33.043 --> 04:34.645
GOOD JOB, GROWN-UPS.

04:34.645 --> 04:36.377
LOOK, I'M GLAD YOU GUYS
LOVE YOUR WORK,

04:36.377 --> 04:37.878
BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.049
(Bobby) LADIES.

04:39.049 --> 04:40.951
I JUST FOUND MY DREAM JOB.

04:40.951 --> 04:42.613
FURK.

04:42.613 --> 04:44.815
BEHOLD.

04:44.815 --> 04:47.858
BOBBY'S BURGERS.
(chuckles)

04:47.858 --> 04:49.820
BOBBY, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
COOK FOOD.

04:49.820 --> 04:53.394
I'VE SEEN YOU FIND FOOD...
OUTSIDE AND THEN EAT IT.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.466
WELL, THAT'S THE BEAUTY
ABOUT MY BUSINESS MODEL.

04:55.466 --> 04:57.598
ALL RIGHT, WHEN DRUNK PEOPLE
COME OUT OF A BAR,

04:57.598 --> 04:59.069
THEY WANT FOOD.

04:59.069 --> 05:00.931
SO WHAT I DO, I GO DOWN
TO THE BURGER JOINT.

05:00.931 --> 05:02.673
I BUY A BUNCH OF
THEIR BURGERS FOR $1 APIECE,

05:02.673 --> 05:04.575
AND THEN I PULL THE TRUCK UP
IN FRONT OF A BAR,

05:04.575 --> 05:07.938
AND I SELL TO THESE ROWDY YAHOOS
FOR 4 BUCKS A POP.

05:07.938 --> 05:09.580
WHAT Y'ALL THINK?

05:09.580 --> 05:11.512
DO YOU WANT TO START,
OR SHOULD I?

05:11.512 --> 05:14.915
I THINK IT'S AMAZING
THAT YOU FOUND YOUR CALLING.

05:14.915 --> 05:18.549
I WISH I HAD THAT.

05:18.549 --> 05:19.750
SERIOUSLY?

05:21.392 --> 05:23.824
HEEL.
STAN HAS A HARNESS.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.397
BUT HE EATS GLASS.
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

05:26.397 --> 05:27.858
WELL, SOMEONE HAS TO HELP PULL
THE TRUCK AROUND TOWN.

05:27.858 --> 05:29.400
IT HAS NO ENGINE.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.901
WELL, HAVE YOU SEEN
ANDO'S LEGS?

05:30.901 --> 05:32.933
HE'S QUADZILLA.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.605
(imitates slapping sound)

05:34.605 --> 05:36.066
I'M READY TO RESPOND.

05:36.066 --> 05:37.468
CORNBREAD,

05:37.468 --> 05:39.339
SCIENCE TELLS ME
YOU HAVE A BRAIN

05:39.339 --> 05:40.841
BECAUSE YOU'RE STANDING
AND BLINKING,

05:40.841 --> 05:42.513
BUT I DON'T IMAGINE
ANYTHING ELSE IN THERE

05:42.513 --> 05:44.114
BUT A MEATBALL THAT TALKS
JUST LIKE YOU.

05:44.114 --> 05:45.776
(imitates Bobby)
HURDY-DUR.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.050
LOOK, I KNOW BEING WITH STAN
24 HOURS A DAY

05:50.050 --> 05:51.882
HAS MADE YOU A LITTLE BIT...

05:51.882 --> 05:53.924
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S CALL IT EDGY,

05:53.924 --> 05:55.486
BUT THAT WAS TOO MEAN,
EVEN FOR YOU.

05:55.486 --> 05:56.727
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

05:56.727 --> 05:58.889
BOBBY'S DREAM
IS ROLLING AWAY.

05:58.889 --> 06:01.892
AY!
(thud)

06:01.892 --> 06:03.934
(cell phone beeps)
OOH, JULES NEEDS ME.

06:03.934 --> 06:05.596
CAN YOU GUYS WATCH THE BAR
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

06:05.596 --> 06:06.797
OBVIOUSLY.
TOTALLY.

06:06.797 --> 06:07.998
ABSOLUTELY.
THANKS.

06:07.998 --> 06:09.400
OKAY.
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.601
OH, MY GOD.

06:10.601 --> 06:11.802
(cork pops)

06:11.802 --> 06:14.445
I FEEL SAD FOR JULES,

06:14.445 --> 06:16.807
SO BUMMED OVER HER JOB.

06:16.807 --> 06:20.080
WELL, SOMETIMES WORK SUCKS.
THAT'S WHY I CALL IT "SURK."

06:20.080 --> 06:22.683
WELL, IT SURKS FOR PEOPLE
LIKE YOU AND MY MOM.
YEAH.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.585
BUT LAURIE AND I--
WE'RE ARTISTS.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.816
I'M A CAKE ARTIST.

06:25.816 --> 06:27.658
WHAT WE DO
CHANGES PEOPLE'S LIVES.

06:27.658 --> 06:29.560
OUR HUMBLE MISSION--
TO INSPIRE HUMANITY,

06:29.560 --> 06:33.393
TO HOLD UP A MIRROR AND ASK
TWO QUESTIONS--WHY AND WHAT IF?

06:33.393 --> 06:36.026
WITH... CUPCAKES
AND PICTURES?

06:36.026 --> 06:38.699
WHAT DO YOU DO AGAIN?
SOMETHING WITH NUMBERS?

06:38.699 --> 06:40.631
I'M A FINANCIAL MANAGER.

06:40.631 --> 06:43.604
DUDE, IF I... (laughs)
HAD TO WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY--

06:43.604 --> 06:46.507
GOING INTO THE SAME OFFICE,
SITTING AT THE SAME COMPUTER,

06:46.507 --> 06:48.439
EATING
THE SAME BOLOGNA SANDWICH,

06:48.439 --> 06:50.741
I WOULD TOTALLY GO BATH SALTS.

06:50.741 --> 06:52.813
SOMETIMES I PLAY SOLITAIRE.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.845
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:54.845 --> 06:56.146
GRAYSON GONE?
YEP.

06:56.146 --> 06:58.749
WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY, BABY.

06:58.749 --> 07:00.521
(glass clatters, beer pours)

07:00.521 --> 07:04.455
(speaking indistinctly)

07:08.599 --> 07:10.801
(singsongy)
STRANGER TOUCH.

07:10.801 --> 07:13.734
YOU REALIZE THIS GAME ENDS
WITH ME BEING BEATEN TO DEATH?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.506
I GOT BIG NEWS.

07:15.506 --> 07:17.137
I REALIZED THAT I HAVEN'T
BEEN SELLING ANY HOUSES

07:17.137 --> 07:18.739
BECAUSE MY HEART'S
NOT IN IT.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.471
SO I'M GONNA QUIT.

07:20.471 --> 07:21.912
QUIT AND DO WHAT?

07:21.912 --> 07:23.574
I DON'T KNOW,

07:23.574 --> 07:25.045
BUT I'M REAL EXCITED
ABOUT THE QUITTING PART.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.847
I MEAN, IT MAKES THINGS
A LITTLE HARDER ON ME,

07:26.847 --> 07:29.449
BUT... (chuckles)
THAT'S NO BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.781
IS IT GETTING SARCASTIC?

07:30.781 --> 07:32.523
(chuckles) NO.

07:32.523 --> 07:34.585
I MEAN, IT'S COOL TO BE
THE SOLE BREADWINNER.

07:34.585 --> 07:37.788
I GET TO PAY FOR
THE MORTGAGE BY MYSELF

07:37.788 --> 07:40.230
AND--OOH! I EVEN GET TO PAY
FOR YOUR SON'S COLLEGE TUITION,

07:40.230 --> 07:42.933
BUT HE PAYS ME BACK
BY BEING SURLY

07:42.933 --> 07:44.665
AND STEALING MY SHIRTS.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.897
HE STEALS FROM ME, JULES.

07:46.897 --> 07:48.138
HE JUST BORROWS.

07:48.138 --> 07:51.041
(clattering)

07:51.041 --> 07:53.203
WHAT'S SHAKIN'?

07:53.203 --> 07:55.946
THAT'S STEALING.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.913
BOBBY'S BURGERS!
GET 'EM WHILE THEY'RE HOT!

08:02.913 --> 08:05.656
THERE YOU GO. WE GOTTA
GET BACK TO THE GRILL.

08:05.656 --> 08:07.588
(metal clanking)
GRAYSON'S RIGHT.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.489
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO
MAKE HIM THE ONLY BREADWINNER.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.822
(continues clanking)
(woman) CAN I GET
FOUR BURGERS, PLEASE?

08:11.822 --> 08:13.223
I NEED FOUR!
FOUR MORE BURGERS.

08:13.223 --> 08:15.095
MAKE 'EM SLOPPY.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.627
CAN YOU MAN THE GRILL
FOR A SECOND?

08:16.627 --> 08:17.998
I GOTTA WARM THESE UP.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.199
ON IT.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.071
UM...
(clanks)

08:21.071 --> 08:22.933
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD
DO FOR A LIVING, YOU KNOW?

08:22.933 --> 08:25.135
(clanking)
I'M... I'M--I'M 43,

08:25.135 --> 08:27.077
I DIDN'T GRADUATE
FROM COLLEGE.

08:27.077 --> 08:29.740
(clanks)
I MEAN, I'M NOT GOOD
AT COMPUTERING.

08:29.740 --> 08:30.941
THE ONLY THING
THAT I'M QUALIFIED FOR

08:30.941 --> 08:32.142
IS REAL ESTATE

08:32.142 --> 08:34.214
AND MAYBE BEING
A PROSTITUTE.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.916
SORRY, J-BIRD,

08:35.916 --> 08:37.117
BUT I DON'T THINK
THERE'S A HUGE MARKET

08:37.117 --> 08:38.549
FOR PROSTITUTES
IN THEIR 40s.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.090
I CAN'T EVEN BE A WHORE?

08:40.090 --> 08:41.892
MOM, I THINK YOU'D BE
AN AMAZING WHORE.

08:41.892 --> 08:44.254
OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST SAID THAT.

08:44.254 --> 08:45.826
I JUST WISH
THERE WAS SOMETHING

08:45.826 --> 08:47.728
I COULD FIND TO DO
THAT MADE ME HAPPY.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.129
ALL RIGHT, THINK BACK.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.300
WHAT WERE THE JOBS
WHERE YOU HAD THE MOST FUN AT?

08:50.300 --> 08:51.862
WELL, I LOVED
WORKING WITH LAURIE.

08:51.862 --> 08:53.564
(chuckles)
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

08:53.564 --> 08:54.905
AS LONG AS YOU'RE
WITH THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE,

08:54.905 --> 08:57.067
WORK AIN'T SO BAD.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.312
HEY THERE, NEW BOSS.

09:02.312 --> 09:03.714
(dings)

09:03.714 --> 09:06.777
HEY-O!
LET'S SELL SOME BOOZE.

09:06.777 --> 09:09.279
NO.

09:09.279 --> 09:11.752
ART. ART.
(camera beeps, shutter clicks)

09:12.853 --> 09:14.284
OOH.
(beep)

09:14.284 --> 09:15.686
ART.

09:15.686 --> 09:17.027
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:17.027 --> 09:18.789
YOU GUYS WERE SO IMPRESSED
WITH YOURSELVES,

09:18.789 --> 09:20.991
THAT IT MADE ME WISH
THAT I WAS AN ARTIST, TOO.

09:20.991 --> 09:22.993
SO I'M MAKING ART.

09:22.993 --> 09:24.334
(beep)
ART.

09:24.334 --> 09:26.136
(beep)
ART.

09:26.136 --> 09:28.268
WITH YOUR CELL PHONE?
SORRY.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.671
THOSE ARE ONLY FOR TAKING
SELF-PORTRAITS

09:30.671 --> 09:32.973
AND PICS OF YOUR SNOOZE
FOR VAGALENTINE'S DAY...

09:32.973 --> 09:36.106
(singsongy)
WHICH IS EVERY DAY.

09:36.106 --> 09:38.749
LAURIE, SEXY FACE.
(beep)

09:38.749 --> 09:40.210
ART.
DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.012
I'M SORRY. IT'S A REFLEX.

09:42.012 --> 09:43.583
GOSH.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.756
IT'S SO HARD
BEING A PHOTOGRAPHER.

09:45.756 --> 09:47.618
I MEAN, THE PICTURE PART
IS EASY.

09:47.618 --> 09:49.890
ANY MONKEY
CAN POINT AND CLICK.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.361
(beep, click)
ART.

09:51.361 --> 09:53.023
I'M JUST HAVING TROUBLE

09:53.023 --> 09:54.825
PULLING OFF
THE PRETENTIOUS PART.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.026
ART.

09:56.026 --> 09:58.729
(clanking)

09:58.729 --> 10:01.131
BOBBY,
I'VE BEEN STRESSED LATELY,

10:01.131 --> 10:04.234
AND I-I SHOULDN'T TAKE IT OUT
ON YOU FOR BEING AN IDIOT.

10:04.234 --> 10:05.876
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

10:05.876 --> 10:08.739
I JUST NEED AN OUTLET
TO GET THIS MEAN OUT.

10:08.739 --> 10:10.210
HEY, CAN I GET A BURGER?

10:10.210 --> 10:11.912
OH, I THINK
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH, BIGGUNS.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.383
(people murmur)

10:13.383 --> 10:15.986
DAMN, THAT FELT GOOD.
TOSS ME AN APRON.

10:17.287 --> 10:19.850
WHICH ONE OF YOU BUTT CHUGGERS
IS NEXT?

10:19.850 --> 10:22.092
OH, THE GINGER.
YOU'RE STEPPING UP,

10:22.092 --> 10:25.295
WITH YOUR FRIEND,
TOO-TIGHT T-SHIRT? OKAY.

10:25.295 --> 10:26.757
(laughs)

10:26.757 --> 10:28.158
(laughter)
LET'S GO.

10:28.158 --> 10:30.761
HERE YOU GO.
(woman) THANK YOU.

10:30.761 --> 10:33.203
EMPLOYEES ONLY
BEHIND THE BAR, PLEASE.

10:33.203 --> 10:36.636
HOW DO YOU NOT SEE
WHAT A GREAT IDEA THIS IS?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.108
I MEAN, IF I WORK HERE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY ME,

10:38.108 --> 10:40.140
PLUS YOU GET TO FIRE
THAT CREEPY WAITER

10:40.140 --> 10:43.013
WITH THE GIANT EYEBROWS.

10:43.013 --> 10:44.875
NOT YOU. (chuckles)

10:44.875 --> 10:46.316
(whispers) IT'S HIM.

10:46.316 --> 10:47.878
(whispers) I KNOW.

10:47.878 --> 10:49.179
(normal voice) I COULD WAITRESS.
I CAN BARTEND.

10:49.179 --> 10:51.281
I CAN FILL UP THE URINALS
WITH ICE.

10:51.281 --> 10:53.123
WHY DO YOU DO THAT,
BY THE WAY?

10:53.123 --> 10:54.324
IT'S FUN TO PEE ON.

10:54.324 --> 10:55.986
OH, GREAT.
NOW I WANT TO TRY IT.

10:55.986 --> 10:57.788
LOOK, I JUST WANT
TO ENJOY MY JOB.

10:57.788 --> 10:58.989
(sets down glass)

10:58.989 --> 11:01.231
MM, YOU THINK
THIS IS FUN,

11:01.231 --> 11:03.864
POURING BEERS ALL DAY?

11:03.864 --> 11:06.697
WHOO! LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S ALL FOAMY.

11:06.697 --> 11:09.740
YOU KNOW,
HOW CAN I SAY THIS?

11:09.740 --> 11:11.301
YOU KNOW HOW WHEN I RUB
MY TEMPLES LIKE THIS,

11:11.301 --> 11:12.873
IT MEANS I WANT TO KILL YOU?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.274
THAT MEANS
YOU WANT TO KILL ME?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.707
YOU DO IT, LIKE,
20 TIMES A DAY.

11:16.707 --> 11:20.951
AND I'VE NEVER DONE THIS
AT MY BAR, NOT ONCE.

11:20.951 --> 11:22.813
I'M SORRY.

11:22.813 --> 11:24.314
YOU CAN'T WORK HERE.

11:24.314 --> 11:26.757
I'LL GIVE YOU MORNING SEX
EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH.

11:26.757 --> 11:27.958
WELCOME ABOARD.

11:27.958 --> 11:30.821
OOH. I GOTTA GO
MELT SOME ICE.

11:30.821 --> 11:32.022
DO THESE TWO PEOPLE
LOOK LIKE

11:32.022 --> 11:33.423
THEY'RE JUST SAYING HELLO

11:33.423 --> 11:35.025
OR LIKE THEY'RE GONNA
STAB EACH OTHER?

11:35.025 --> 11:36.767
DEFINITELY STAB.

11:36.767 --> 11:37.928
AWESOME.

11:37.928 --> 11:39.469
IT'S A GANG INITIATION CAKE.

11:39.469 --> 11:42.803
I AM NOW THE OFFICIAL BAKER
OF THE LATIN KINGS.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.704
LI'L CHOKE IS GONNA BE
SO EXCITED.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.907
HE GETS STOMPED IN
THIS WEEK.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.779
SO, LAURIE,

11:48.779 --> 11:50.380
I WANT YOU TO HANG ONE
OF THESE PICTURES IN YOUR SHOP.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.212
BUT HERE'S THE THING,
I TOOK ONE

11:52.212 --> 11:57.247
AND TRAVIS TOOK ONE, YOU KNOW,
WITH ALL HIS TALENT.

11:57.247 --> 12:00.020
ALL YOU'VE GOTTA DO
IS TELL ME WHICH ONE'S WHICH.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.992
JUST FOCUS ON
THE SYMBOLIC USE OF LIGHT

12:01.992 --> 12:04.154
UTILIZED TO--
SHUT IT, ART DOUCHE.

12:04.154 --> 12:05.826
OKAY.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.158
THIS PICTURE REALLY CAPTURES
THIS MAN'S SOUL,

12:08.158 --> 12:09.729
YOU KNOW?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.932
BUT THIS ONE IS, LIKE,
A CAUGHT MOMENT IN TIME.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.433
IT'S LIKE I COULD JUST,
YOU KNOW,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.906
TURN MY HEAD,
IT'S LIKE I'M THERE.

12:15.906 --> 12:17.237
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.
OH, GOD.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.869
OKAY, UM,

12:18.869 --> 12:21.041
THIS ONE!
DID I PICK RIGHT, TRAVIS.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.742
(moans)

12:22.742 --> 12:25.045
OH! SO CLOSE.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.418
I TOOK THIS ONE
AT BOBBY'S BURGERS

12:28.418 --> 12:31.351
ON MY CELL WHILE I
SPUN AROUND IN A CIRCLE

12:31.351 --> 12:33.924
WITH MY EYES CLOSED.

12:33.924 --> 12:35.385
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER,

12:35.385 --> 12:37.757
I ALSO MADE
SOME ARTSY CUPCAKES.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.930
I SLIPPED THEM
INTO YOUR DISPLAY CASE.

12:39.930 --> 12:41.962
I'VE BEEN SELLING CUP-FAKES?

12:41.962 --> 12:43.193
(gasps)

12:43.193 --> 12:44.935
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:44.935 --> 12:46.937
I CAN'T TELL WHICH ARE HIS
AND WHICH ARE MINE.

12:46.937 --> 12:49.099
(camera shutter clicks, beep)
ART.

12:49.099 --> 12:51.902
I THINK I'LL CALL THIS ONE...
"SUCK IT!" (chuckles)

12:51.902 --> 12:53.804
(gasps)

12:53.804 --> 12:55.145
ENJOY YOUR MEAL.

12:55.145 --> 12:57.277
HOPEFULLY IT CAN REPLACE
THE LOVE OF A WOMAN.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.980
(laughter)
DO ME! DO ME!

12:59.980 --> 13:02.382
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
A GIRL SAID "YES" TO THAT?

13:02.382 --> 13:03.814
(crowd) OHH!
(laughter)

13:03.814 --> 13:05.415
(amplified voice)
BACK OF THE LINE, SASQUATCH.

13:05.415 --> 13:07.287
(laughter continues)

13:07.287 --> 13:09.559
(laughs) CHECK OUT
ALL THESE PEOPLE.

13:09.559 --> 13:11.791
I MEAN, THIS ONE GUY DROVE
ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM TAMPA

13:11.791 --> 13:13.864
JUST TO MEET
THE BURGER BITCH.

13:13.864 --> 13:15.465
HONEST TO GOD,
YOU WERE PUT ON THIS EARTH

13:15.465 --> 13:17.267
TO HURT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

13:17.267 --> 13:18.528
AW.

13:18.528 --> 13:20.400
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE EATING GOATS

13:20.400 --> 13:22.272
UNDER A BRIDGE SOMEWHERE?
(laughter)

13:22.272 --> 13:24.134
WE'RE NEIGHBORS.

13:24.134 --> 13:25.976
SHE'S BEEN DOING THAT TO ME
SINCE BEFORE IT WAS COOL.

13:25.976 --> 13:27.277
BACK OF THE LINE.

13:27.277 --> 13:29.279
(sighs)

13:29.279 --> 13:30.941
HELL, YEAH!

13:30.941 --> 13:33.443
THAT'S HOW YOU POUR
A GLASS OF WINE, BITCH.

13:33.443 --> 13:35.946
NO, THAT'S HOW YOU POUR
A GLASS OF WINE.

13:35.946 --> 13:38.919
IF I POUR ALL MY GLASSES
LIKE THAT, I LOSE MONEY.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.120
GOT IT.
(dings)

13:40.120 --> 13:41.491
ALL RIGHT.
WHO WANTS A REFILL?

13:41.491 --> 13:43.453
STOP RINGING MY BELL.

13:43.453 --> 13:45.255
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID
LAST NIGHT.

13:45.255 --> 13:46.456
(ding)

13:46.456 --> 13:48.158
HEY-O!

13:48.158 --> 13:50.200
THANK YOU. FRANK,
HERE'S YOUR BURGER.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.562
THAT'LL BE 5 BUCKS.

13:52.562 --> 13:54.905
WE CHARGE 10 BUCKS
FOR A BURGER.

13:54.905 --> 13:56.266
IN REAL ESTATE,

13:56.266 --> 13:57.968
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS TO MAKE THE SALE.

13:57.968 --> 13:59.509
FRANK WASN'T GONNA BUY HIGH.

13:59.509 --> 14:01.241
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

14:01.241 --> 14:03.443
THAT WOMAN OVER THERE IS HAVING
A $33 FISH-AND-CHIPS.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.315
OH, THANKS, GUILLERMO.

14:05.315 --> 14:06.546
THANK YOU.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.278
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
FIRE HIM.

14:08.278 --> 14:10.220
I COULDN'T.
HE'S GOT THREE KIDS,

14:10.220 --> 14:12.552
PLUS HE SAID HE'D COVER FOR ME
ON FRIDAYS WHEN I DO PILATES.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.154
SO WE GET THE JOY

14:14.154 --> 14:16.586
OF SPENDING EVERY SECOND
OF EVERY DAY TOGETHER,

14:16.586 --> 14:18.458
AND I DON'T EVEN SAVE MONEY?

14:18.458 --> 14:20.891
(dings)

14:20.891 --> 14:23.093
I ALSO TOLD HIM
HE COULD RING THE BELL.

14:24.534 --> 14:27.197
OH, NO. YOU'RE DOING
THE TEMPLE RUB.

14:27.197 --> 14:28.939
SWEETIE, WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE IT STOP?

14:28.939 --> 14:30.500
REALLY.
I'LL--I'LL DO ANYTHING.

14:34.304 --> 14:37.147
YOU KEPT THAT JOB
FOR 12 MINUTES.

14:37.147 --> 14:38.608
WORK SUCKS.

14:38.608 --> 14:40.480
YEAH, IT DOES.

14:49.219 --> 14:50.590
JERRY, YOU'VE BEEN
TO THE HOUSE SIX TIMES.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.092
DID YOU SEE A CLOSET?

14:52.092 --> 14:54.164
DID YOU WALK INTO IT?

14:54.164 --> 14:56.967
THEN, YEAH,
IT'S A WALK-IN CLOSET.

14:56.967 --> 14:59.129
I NEED A HIT.

14:59.129 --> 15:00.670
MORE CAKE ICING?

15:00.670 --> 15:03.573
NO, SHE GASSED UP HER CAR
ON THE WAY OVER. (sniffs)

15:03.573 --> 15:06.076
MM. DIESEL.

15:06.076 --> 15:07.577
ANDY CRAPPED ALL OVER
WHAT WE DO.

15:07.577 --> 15:08.979
HE HAS NO--

15:08.979 --> 15:10.280
NOT NOW, TARVIS.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.312
YOU GET A 20-SECOND HIGH
FROM GOOD GAS.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.913
HOLD ON.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.115
WOW. WHAT A RUSH.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.017
OKAY, WHAT DID ANDY DO?

15:17.017 --> 15:19.319
HE INSULTED OUR CRAFTS.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.422
THOSE CAKES ARE SO MUCH MORE
THAN JUST EGGS, FLOUR, AND MILK.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.224
I PUT MY SOUL IN THEM.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.695
AND ACCORDING TO SOME LIAR
ON YELP,

15:25.695 --> 15:27.497
ONE OF MY FAKE NAILS.
WHATEVER.

15:27.497 --> 15:29.359
NORMAL PEOPLE
JUST DON'T REALIZE

15:29.359 --> 15:31.561
THE SACRIFICES WE MAKE
FOR OUR ART.

15:31.561 --> 15:33.363
GOD, YOU TWO ARE SMUG.

15:33.363 --> 15:34.965
IS THIS THE GASOLINE TALKING?

15:34.965 --> 15:36.967
I MEAN, LET'S NOT FORGET
THE DYNAMIC HERE.

15:36.967 --> 15:39.609
YOU THINK I'M PERFECT.

15:39.609 --> 15:41.141
I REMEMBER.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.712
BUT LISTEN UP.

15:42.712 --> 15:44.975
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE
ON THIS EARTH

15:44.975 --> 15:46.676
THAT ACTUALLY LOVES
WHAT THEY DO,

15:46.676 --> 15:48.948
YOU DON'T EVER RUB THAT
IN ANYONE'S FACE.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.652
NO, YOU BE GRATEFUL
AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

15:54.024 --> 15:55.325
(sighs)

15:55.325 --> 15:57.487
OH, NO.

15:57.487 --> 15:59.259
NOT AGAIN.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.091
(amplified voice) ALL RIGHT,
PEOPLE, LET'S LINE UP

16:01.091 --> 16:03.733
FROM LEAST ANNOYING
TO THE MOST.
(crowd murmuring)

16:03.733 --> 16:06.136
TOM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
IN THE BACK OF THE LINE,

16:06.136 --> 16:08.298
BUT YOU SHOULD BE
NEAR IT.

16:08.298 --> 16:10.440
YES! NOT IN THE BACK.
HIGH FIVE!

16:10.440 --> 16:11.641
NOW YOU'RE IN THE BACK.

16:11.641 --> 16:13.443
(crowd) OHH!

16:13.443 --> 16:17.047
OH, NOTHING SADDER
THAN A COP ON A BIKE.

16:17.047 --> 16:19.209
CAN SOMEONE GET HIM A BELL
FOR HIS HANDLEBARS?

16:19.209 --> 16:20.710
COULD YOU TWO
STEP OUT OF THE TRUCK?

16:20.710 --> 16:24.184
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I KNOW MY RIGHTS.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.216
(under breath) I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY ARE. WHAT ARE THEY?
I DON'T KNOW.

16:26.216 --> 16:28.018
YOU'RE SCREWED
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PERMIT.

16:28.018 --> 16:29.989
WELL, LUCKILY I HAVE ONE.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.561
I'LL GO GRAB IT.

16:33.223 --> 16:36.126
BOBBY! STOP!
HE'S GOT A GUN.

16:37.327 --> 16:39.399
YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.005
(all, singsongy)
STRANGER TOUCH!

16:47.607 --> 16:50.510
I'M GONNA MISS THAT TRUCK.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.084
IT WAS NICE MAKING PEOPLE
FEEL BAD ABOUT THEMSELVES,

16:54.084 --> 16:55.745
EVEN FOR A SECOND.

16:55.745 --> 16:57.717
OOH!

16:57.717 --> 17:00.090
GIVE ME A HIT OF THAT,
E-TRAIN.

17:00.090 --> 17:02.392
I'M NOT MEANT TO BE
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

17:02.392 --> 17:05.155
I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO GO BACK
TO WORK. IT'S TIME.

17:05.155 --> 17:07.457
THAT'S COOL. WHAT WOULD BE
YOUR DREAM JOB?

17:07.457 --> 17:08.698
MMM.

17:08.698 --> 17:10.460
DON'T BOGART IT.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.262
WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF
ABOUT YOU AND DREAM JOBS?

17:12.262 --> 17:13.733
WHAT ARE YOU, 7?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.235
I JUST WANT TO BE HAPPY
AT MY WORK.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.606
OH, AND BY THE WAY, BOBBY,

17:16.606 --> 17:18.568
I'D MAKE
AN AWESOME PROSTITUTE.

17:18.568 --> 17:21.411
I FEEL LIKE I'M MISSING
SOME BACKSTORY.

17:21.411 --> 17:24.314
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE MARRIED,
REAL ESTATE MADE YOU HAPPY.

17:24.314 --> 17:26.146
YEAH. THAT WAS WHEN
YOU WEREN'T MAKING ANY CASH.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.618
I CAME THROUGH,
BOUGHT US A HOUSE.

17:28.618 --> 17:30.350
I THINK DEEP DOWN,

17:30.350 --> 17:32.182
I LIKED TAKING CARE
OF THE FAMILY, JUST MYSELF.

17:32.182 --> 17:35.355
THAT'S WHY MARRYING GRAYSON
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BIG MISTAKE.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.257
HE MAKES HIS OWN MONEY.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.489
SOMETIMES I FORGET
HOW MESSED UP YOU ARE.

17:39.489 --> 17:41.361
I STILL REMEMBER
HOW STOKED YOU WERE

17:41.361 --> 17:43.133
WHEN YOU SOLD
YOUR FIRST HOUSE. (chuckles)

17:43.133 --> 17:45.095
YOU BOUGHT EVERYONE WE KNEW
A STEAK DINNER.

17:45.095 --> 17:47.066
OH, MAN.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.539
I WOULD LOVE TO GET
THAT FEELING BACK.

17:49.539 --> 17:51.541
THEN QUIT BEING LAZY
AND JUST DO IT.

17:51.541 --> 17:52.802
YEAH.

17:52.802 --> 17:55.575
THIS STUFF MAKES YOU LAZY.

17:56.806 --> 17:59.078
(door closes)

17:59.078 --> 18:00.850
(Laurie) HEY.

18:00.850 --> 18:02.452
WE BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

18:02.452 --> 18:05.155
THE LATIN KINGS
DIDN'T WANT MY CAKE.

18:05.155 --> 18:08.218
TURNS OUT LI'L CHOKE
DOESN'T LIKE CARAMEL.

18:08.218 --> 18:11.221
OH, AND ALSO, HE'S DEAD.
AW.

18:11.221 --> 18:14.594
ALSO, UH... I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.727
OH. NOW THIS...

18:17.727 --> 18:19.129
THIS IS ART.

18:19.129 --> 18:23.173
SORRY WE WERE ART DOUCHES.
YEAH.

18:23.173 --> 18:26.336
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
I HAD A DREAM.

18:26.336 --> 18:28.278
I WANTED TO BE A COMEDIAN.

18:28.278 --> 18:31.110
I EVEN DID SOME OPEN MICS
AT MY BROTHER'S CLUB IN MIAMI.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.612
WERE YOU ANY GOOD?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.644
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT WAS IN... LITTLE HAVANA,

18:34.644 --> 18:36.746
AND I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH,
AND, YOU KNOW--

18:36.746 --> 18:38.518
BUT I-I DID
A PRETTY GOOD ACCENT,

18:38.518 --> 18:41.251
AND, YOU KNOW,
THE CROWD REALLY LOVED ME.

18:41.251 --> 18:42.592
(laughs)

18:42.592 --> 18:44.254
MMM.
MMM.

18:44.254 --> 18:46.726
в™Єв™Єв™Є

18:46.726 --> 18:48.628
(men)
в™Є I'LL BE FLICKING STONES в™Є

18:48.628 --> 18:49.899
OH, NOT AGAIN.

18:49.899 --> 18:53.233
I REALLY SHOULD START
WEARING GLOVES.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.834
(woman) I WANTED
THE CRAB CAKES, BECAUSE I KNOW

18:54.834 --> 18:57.707
THEY'RE HEAVY, TOO,
SO DON'T--I MEAN...
YEAH.

18:57.707 --> 18:59.469
BUT I'M JUST SAYING,
IF YOU COULD JUST HAVE ONE--
I'M NOT SURE I'M
IN THE MOOD FOR CRAB.

18:59.469 --> 19:01.771
OH, GOOD GOD. YOU CAN'T EVEN
PICK AN APPETIZER,

19:01.771 --> 19:04.914
MUCH LESS A HOUSE.

19:04.914 --> 19:07.577
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

19:07.577 --> 19:09.219
I BROUGHT THE CONTRACT.

19:09.219 --> 19:11.381
YOU'RE GOING TO BUY
THAT DAMN PLACE.

19:11.381 --> 19:14.784
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S SCARY,
BUYING A HOUSE,

19:14.784 --> 19:16.556
ESPECIALLY FOR A NEW COUPLE.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.328
OH, HONEY,
YOU'RE PROBABLY AFRAID

19:18.328 --> 19:19.859
OF THAT KIND OF COMMITMENT.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.331
в™Є WALKING ON SAND в™Є

19:21.331 --> 19:23.333
AND, JER...
YOU'RE PROBABLY NERVOUS

19:23.333 --> 19:25.865
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT BONNIE'S
GOT SOME DRINKING ISSUES.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.267
WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT?

19:27.267 --> 19:28.468
NOTHING. JULES, GO ON.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.899
YOU GUYS ARE READY FOR THIS.

19:29.899 --> 19:31.571
NOW HERE IS YOUR PEN.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.373
HERE IS YOUR PEN.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.245
THEY'LL HAVE THE HUMMUS.

19:35.245 --> 19:37.707
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S HOW I SAY IT.

19:37.707 --> 19:41.451
NOW ARE YOU READY
TO BUY THIS HOUSE OR NOT?

19:41.451 --> 19:43.182

19:55.965 --> 19:57.667
WHAT, DID THEY PAY IN CASH?

19:57.667 --> 19:59.499
OH, THESE ARE
FROM YOUR BAR.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.301
(laughs)

20:01.301 --> 20:03.573

20:26.626 --> 20:28.658
AND SHE GOES, "I WANT TO GO

20:28.658 --> 20:32.632
