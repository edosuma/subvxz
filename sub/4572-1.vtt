03:11.799 --> 03:13.528
How did you know...

03:13.801 --> 03:15.564
...that was the blue one?

03:17.171 --> 03:19.605
- I do not know, Master.
- You do not know?

03:22.376 --> 03:23.240
No.

03:28.916 --> 03:31.214
I humbly apologize
for my ignorance, Master.

03:31.285 --> 03:33.810
I will do anything to prove my worthiness!

03:35.289 --> 03:37.883
You have been to the movies again, I see.

03:38.059 --> 03:41.085
Full of disciples falling to their knees...

03:41.529 --> 03:44.794
...at the slightest hint
of their master's displeasure.

03:46.067 --> 03:50.003
Leroy, this is not a punishment.

03:51.539 --> 03:53.268
It is a celebration!

03:53.641 --> 03:55.734
You have touched the final level.

03:55.910 --> 03:58.105
You knew without knowing!

03:59.213 --> 04:01.977
We have finished our journey together.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.678
But, Master...

04:05.186 --> 04:08.314
...the final level. The glow!

04:08.856 --> 04:09.948
You always said...

04:10.024 --> 04:12.822
That when you reached the final level...

04:12.927 --> 04:16.293
...you would know it by the appearance
of a sublime glow...

04:16.363 --> 04:18.195
...all over your body.

04:18.366 --> 04:19.765
Come, Leroy.

04:20.535 --> 04:21.762
Get up.

04:24.238 --> 04:27.730
What you seek is not written on the floor.

04:29.844 --> 04:33.280
The final level is a return to the beginning.

04:34.382 --> 04:37.146
This is the Last Dragon.

04:38.986 --> 04:41.853
A cycle is complete...

04:41.956 --> 04:44.686
...and now there is
a new emptiness to be filled...

04:46.060 --> 04:48.893
...a new journey
which you must make alone.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.592
I am confused.

04:51.032 --> 04:56.402
Good. Confusion is a part of life,
as are vengeance, fear and love.

04:56.737 --> 04:59.535
All facets must be embraced...

04:59.674 --> 05:01.869
...for then, and only then...

05:02.109 --> 05:05.545
...will you break through
the wall of mystery to the glow.

05:06.981 --> 05:10.849
Master, perhaps with more time to train.
Master, I need more time.

05:10.918 --> 05:14.479
I am no longer your master!

05:24.765 --> 05:26.096
Leroy...

05:27.001 --> 05:30.300
...if it is a master you must have...

05:31.639 --> 05:35.507
...there is an old sage
called Sum Dum Goy.

05:35.810 --> 05:39.871
He is said to be the wisest man
in the universe. Go, find him.

05:39.947 --> 05:41.847
He is here in New York.

05:53.794 --> 05:56.661
Take this. It was Bruce Lee's.

05:58.366 --> 06:01.858
When you find the master
who will take you to the final level...

06:02.503 --> 06:03.902
...give it to him.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.207
Go now, my son, on your journey.

06:12.146 --> 06:13.135
Go.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.889
Joints and bags! Joints and bags!

07:39.967 --> 07:43.494
Put his butt on the chuck wagon
and send his ass to the dogs, man!

07:50.945 --> 07:53.379
- Shuffle on him, Bruce!
- Sting him!

08:26.447 --> 08:29.712
That's that, man,
and there ain't no comin' back!

08:52.606 --> 08:54.699
- Am I the meanest?
- Sho'nuff!

08:54.775 --> 08:57.300
- Am I the prettiest?
- Sho'nuff!

08:57.378 --> 09:00.745
Am I the baddest mo-fo
lowdown around this town?

09:00.848 --> 09:01.644
Sho'nuff!

09:01.715 --> 09:03.945
- Well, who am I?
- Sho'nuff!

09:04.018 --> 09:06.316
- Who am I?
- Sho'nuff!

09:06.487 --> 09:08.785
I can't hear you!

09:09.256 --> 09:10.814
Sho'nuff!

09:14.128 --> 09:17.120
The Shogun of Harlem!

09:25.573 --> 09:27.507
Crunch, seats.

09:30.044 --> 09:32.376
This is Sho's row. Move it.

09:32.513 --> 09:34.071
I said beat it!

09:35.282 --> 09:37.250
I know who can beat you!

09:37.952 --> 09:42.286
- Who said that? Beast, find who said that!
- I got him, Sho. I got him.

09:42.356 --> 09:44.381
I got him, Sho.

09:45.893 --> 09:48.691
Here you go, Sho.
Here's the roach that said it!

09:50.397 --> 09:52.831
Who's badder than the Shogun?

09:52.933 --> 09:54.901
Bruce Leroy, that's who!

09:55.703 --> 09:57.534
Bruce Leroy?

09:58.372 --> 10:00.169
Bruce Leroy?

10:04.411 --> 10:09.280
That's the only guy that stands
between Sho and total supremacy.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.191
Well, well, well.

10:21.328 --> 10:23.558
If it ain't the mysterious...

10:23.631 --> 10:26.259
...the illusive Leroy Green.

10:28.235 --> 10:31.170
I've been waitin' a long time for this, Leroy.

10:31.505 --> 10:35.134
I am sick of hearing
these bullshit superman stories...

10:35.276 --> 10:37.506
...about the "wahsa" legendary...

10:37.578 --> 10:41.776
...Bruce Leroy catchin' bullets
with his teeth.

10:42.583 --> 10:45.575
Catches bullets with his teeth?

10:46.387 --> 10:48.048
Nigger, please!

10:48.756 --> 10:52.283
The secret awaits eyes
unclouded by ambition.

10:52.359 --> 10:53.291
What?

10:53.494 --> 10:58.431
Those who are bound by desire see only
that which can be held in their hands.

10:58.766 --> 11:01.564
See, now it is mumbo-jumbo like that...

11:04.238 --> 11:07.696
...and skinny lizards like you,
thinkin' they're the Last Dragon...

11:07.775 --> 11:10.039
...that gives kung fu a bad name.

11:11.445 --> 11:16.041
Get up, Leroy. I got something real
for your ass in these hands.

11:16.183 --> 11:19.311
We gonna settle this once and for all
'cause I am back.

11:19.687 --> 11:23.521
The Shogun is back on the scene
and the Shogun is the master.

11:23.591 --> 11:25.855
Why don't you sit down and shut up?

11:26.493 --> 11:29.826
What? Why don't I sit down and what?

11:30.030 --> 11:32.191
I said, "Why don't you sit down
and shut up?"

11:32.266 --> 11:35.599
Why don't anybody who wants me
to sit down and shut up...

11:35.836 --> 11:37.827
...come down here and make me?

11:39.206 --> 11:43.233
Why don't any fifty of you
who want me to sit down and shut up...

11:43.377 --> 11:46.505
...come down here just for the fun of it?

11:46.847 --> 11:49.873
Yeah, come on, fool! This fool's mine!

11:54.622 --> 11:56.112
Jack him up, baby!

11:57.591 --> 11:59.422
Don't hurt that face, baby!

12:00.027 --> 12:01.119
Yeah!

12:28.322 --> 12:30.517
Leroy, I'm going...

12:40.901 --> 12:44.234
You'll never use this foot again!

12:49.109 --> 12:50.269
Leroy!

12:50.878 --> 12:52.743
I'm gonna get you Leroy...

12:52.813 --> 12:54.610
...because I am the Shogun!

12:54.715 --> 12:57.980
I will not rest until everybody knows...

12:58.052 --> 13:00.020
...Shogun is the master!

13:03.724 --> 13:04.986
You wimp!

13:26.113 --> 13:27.705
Still hungry, are we?

13:29.116 --> 13:31.607
I've got a surprise. Dessert!

14:00.647 --> 14:04.276
Live from Seventh Heaven,
it's Laura's Video Hotpix...

14:04.718 --> 14:06.743
...brought to you by Coca-Cola.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.014
Coke is it.

14:13.093 --> 14:15.220
Soon that's going to be you, Angie...

14:15.295 --> 14:17.763
...dancing around on that screen,
ain't that right?

14:18.132 --> 14:19.224
Hey, Angie, baby...

14:19.299 --> 14:21.631
...soon that's going to be you up there,
right?

14:21.702 --> 14:23.397
Yeah!

14:23.470 --> 14:25.563
That's my girl!

14:31.712 --> 14:33.304
Baby's going to be a star!

14:33.447 --> 14:36.644
If you'd have put this energy
into gettin' me a title fight...

14:36.717 --> 14:39.185
...maybe I'd have been
on my way to Vegas now.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.118
You lost, Rock, you lost!

14:41.789 --> 14:43.450
Every fight I got you.

14:43.891 --> 14:46.519
"The Great White Hopeless"
they called you. Remember?

14:46.593 --> 14:48.959
What do you think
they're going to call her?

14:49.029 --> 14:51.862
A goddess is what they're going to call her.
A goddess!

14:51.932 --> 14:54.423
What she'll do to people
has never been done before.

14:54.501 --> 14:56.437
- Make 'em run for cover?
- That's cute.

15:01.275 --> 15:05.974
And now, for my video hotpick
of the week, and it is hot...

15:07.181 --> 15:09.843
...I say we rock on with DeBarge.

15:10.584 --> 15:13.144
Rhythm of the Night.

15:15.989 --> 15:19.755
"When it feels like
the world is on your shoulders

15:19.927 --> 15:23.886
"And all of the madness
has got you going crazy

15:24.164 --> 15:27.930
"It's time to get out
step out into the streets

15:28.068 --> 15:32.061
"Where all of the action
is right there at your feet, well

15:32.439 --> 15:36.273
"I know a place where we can
dance the whole night away

15:36.743 --> 15:39.803
"Underneath the electric stars

15:40.581 --> 15:43.277
"Just come with me
and we can shake the blues

15:43.383 --> 15:47.877
"Right away
You'll be doing fine once the music starts

15:48.856 --> 15:51.154
"Feel the beat of the rhythm of the night

15:51.225 --> 15:52.817
"Dance until the morning light"

15:53.594 --> 15:55.755
I don't know why you're
going through this.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.194
Give me five minutes, Eddie...

15:57.264 --> 15:59.698
...and this chick'll be begging
to play this thing.

15:59.766 --> 16:01.199
You got no class, Rock.

16:01.268 --> 16:03.202
I know how to handle
these show biz types.

16:03.270 --> 16:06.171
You gotta wine 'em, dine 'em,
you let 'em order à la carte.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.004
After all, me and this lady,
we got a lot in common.

16:09.076 --> 16:13.069
She's the video-rock queen, but I,
Eddie Arkadian, am the video-game king!

16:13.146 --> 16:16.775
She's got the audience but I got the vision.
That's a match made in heaven.

16:20.420 --> 16:22.820
I thought I told you to get rid of that thing.

16:22.890 --> 16:26.758
You also told me,
"Keep it, it comes in handy." Remember?

16:26.827 --> 16:30.354
Yeah, I remember!
Damn, that thing gives me the creeps.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.795
"Feel the beat of the rhythm of the night

16:32.866 --> 16:34.959
"Dance until the morning light

"Forget about the worries on your mind

16:37.070 --> 16:41.029

Feel the beat of the rhythm of the night

16:41.241 --> 16:45.507
"Dance until the morning light

"The music's playin'
It's a celebration

17:09.403 --> 17:12.031
"The music's playin'
Everybody dance

17:12.105 --> 17:14.505
"To the beat of the rhythm of the night

17:20.314 --> 17:22.578
"Feel the beat of the rhythm of the night"

17:23.016 --> 17:26.952
All we're talking about... We're just
talking about one dinner out of your life.

17:27.354 --> 17:29.322
Come on, at least have dinner with him.

17:29.389 --> 17:31.152
J.J., I would love to help you out...

17:31.224 --> 17:34.853
...but the fact is my show is booked solid
for the next four weeks.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.862
So you're just going to have to wait.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.160
- Honey...
- Please, we've got a show to do.

17:39.399 --> 17:42.163
Will you at least look at the videotape?

17:42.235 --> 17:44.795
- J.J., there is no point.
- Laura, there is a point.

17:44.871 --> 17:47.169
The point of the knife which is at my neck.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.266
He'll slit my throat if you don't do this.
Come on, Laura!

17:50.344 --> 17:52.539
What are you talking about?
You in some trouble?

17:52.613 --> 17:55.605
- Who's going to slit your throat?
- Sit down, we've got a show!

17:55.682 --> 17:57.582
Laura, this guy plays rough.

17:57.651 --> 17:59.516
Thirty seconds, Laura.

17:59.586 --> 18:02.146
What guy? Okay. Tell me, J.J., who?

18:02.289 --> 18:04.348
- Eddie Arkadian.
- Who is Eddie Arkadian?

18:04.424 --> 18:07.757
Eddie Arkadian is a heavy dude
who wants to have this videotape...

18:07.828 --> 18:10.422
...played in the worst way.
Come on, Laura!

18:10.497 --> 18:14.365
Fifteen seconds, Laura.
Come on. Let's go!

18:14.501 --> 18:16.162
Come here. Great.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.438
Why don't you just call a cop, okay?

18:18.505 --> 18:20.905
My life is not filled with all that craziness.

18:20.974 --> 18:21.963
Five seconds!

18:22.042 --> 18:24.943
Tell that Eddie Ark,
or whatever his name is, to forget it!

18:25.012 --> 18:27.913
- Arkadian. Laura!
- One! You're on!

18:46.099 --> 18:50.729
"I found a place, finally find a place
for you and me to go

18:50.904 --> 18:55.398
"If you want to get in
Step up in the elevator

18:55.475 --> 18:58.933
"Press number seven

"To get to Seventh Heaven

"I can't believe what you're gonna see

"Once you get inside
I know you'll love my ride

"You can fool around in my room

"And enjoy my golden ride, keep it up

"Up and around I'll never let you down

"Going up, I'll keep it up

20:01.274 --> 20:04.072
Thank you, everybody,
and welcome to Seventh Heaven.

20:04.144 --> 20:06.635
I'm glad you made it. I'm glad I made it.

20:06.913 --> 20:09.074
Today my special guests,
the tastemakers...

20:09.149 --> 20:11.777
...from the now generation,
with my Cloud Crowd.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.317
J.J., my main man! What's happening?

20:18.992 --> 20:20.084
What?

20:22.929 --> 20:25.989
Nobody turns down
an Eddie Arkadian invitation.

20:26.867 --> 20:27.856
Nobody.

20:28.201 --> 20:30.669
So come on down and join us
because the winner...

20:30.737 --> 20:34.173
...will get a Seventh Heavenly
evening out on the town with me.

20:34.241 --> 20:36.436
What do you think about that?

20:38.011 --> 20:39.308
How about a kiss?

20:39.379 --> 20:40.710
Who said that?

20:40.914 --> 20:44.748
- I did!
- No, I said it!

20:44.918 --> 20:46.681
Well, you never know.

20:47.687 --> 20:49.587
But here's one for now.

20:51.558 --> 20:52.582
Got it!

20:54.094 --> 20:55.288
"You found my place

20:55.362 --> 20:59.890
"You finally found my place
Yes, love's inside my lords

21:00.133 --> 21:03.432
"Dancin' all the time

21:03.670 --> 21:06.935
"Hell with incinerators
Heaven never burned

21:07.040 --> 21:09.270
"An angel on a fire

21:11.745 --> 21:16.944
"He never burned an angel on a fire
He was full of desire

21:17.951 --> 21:23.150
"Oh, no, we don't burn angels on the fire"

21:36.069 --> 21:38.003
That's my babe!

21:38.104 --> 21:40.937
- What are you talkin' about?
- That's my woman up there.

21:41.007 --> 21:43.771
- Laura?
- She don't know it yet, but she's mine.

21:45.212 --> 21:46.577
Yeah!

22:04.965 --> 22:07.798
- Laura, sign here!
- I love you, Laura!

22:10.170 --> 22:13.469
We love you, Laura!

22:54.481 --> 22:56.312
How you doin' tonight, Sal?

22:56.449 --> 22:59.282
You just sit back and relax. Sal got sick.

23:00.220 --> 23:01.482
What are you doing?

23:01.554 --> 23:03.613
The right thing, Ms. Charles,
which is what...

23:03.690 --> 23:06.090
...you're gonna do if you got half a brain.

23:11.264 --> 23:14.028
- Help! Somebody help me!
- Put her in the car!

23:14.100 --> 23:15.829
Come on, get her in here.

23:16.269 --> 23:18.999
- Help me, somebody!
- Get in the car, bitch!

23:22.342 --> 23:24.537
I would not do that if I were you.

23:25.578 --> 23:27.170
You little punk!

23:38.091 --> 23:41.891
What are you, crazy?
Huh, tough guy? Come on!

23:45.665 --> 23:47.064
Your mother!

23:47.534 --> 23:48.523
Come on!

23:52.105 --> 23:53.595
Come on! Come here!

24:28.641 --> 24:30.632
Are you all right, miss?

24:30.777 --> 24:35.077
Yeah. I don't know. I guess so.

24:38.885 --> 24:41.080
What about you? Are you okay?

24:41.354 --> 24:43.151
They did not harm me.

24:46.793 --> 24:48.055
Wow!

24:55.068 --> 24:56.467
Your things.

25:05.512 --> 25:07.639
That's okay, I can get them.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.215
It seems that everything is safe now.

25:12.352 --> 25:13.284
Yeah.

25:21.961 --> 25:23.485
You sure you are all right?

25:23.563 --> 25:26.657
Yeah, really.
Just a little shaken up, I think.

25:27.767 --> 25:29.701
God, what was that all about?

25:31.571 --> 25:33.038
I don't believe it.

25:33.106 --> 25:37.065
You were really something, boy.
I just don't know how to thank you.

25:47.654 --> 25:49.383
Did you see where that guy went?

25:49.456 --> 25:53.290
Yeah, he's right...
I don't know. You getting in or what?

26:08.608 --> 26:10.838
Come on, honey, let's go.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.782
Where is that deejay lady anyway?

26:23.156 --> 26:25.124
I mean, what's the big deal?

26:25.225 --> 26:29.286
- Can't she just meet us there?
- Angela, sweetheart, shut up!

26:30.096 --> 26:34.055
- But, Eddie, I'm hungry. I want to go!
- I said shut up!

26:35.135 --> 26:36.602
Gee, don't cry.

26:37.604 --> 26:41.165
Listen, Laura what's-her-face
is gonna be here any second.

26:41.407 --> 26:46.003
We don't want our star to look like
a little pig peed in her eyes now, do we?

26:46.079 --> 26:47.740
Then knock it off!

26:48.381 --> 26:50.474
Don't bug me! Fix your face!

26:50.917 --> 26:52.817
Shut up!

26:54.721 --> 26:58.088
As soon as the chick gets here,
we leave, okay? Okay.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.144
- Now, boss.
- Boss!

27:22.215 --> 27:25.116
Boss, don't get mad
because it wasn't our fault, all right?

27:25.185 --> 27:27.847
- There was nothing we could do.
- There were bodyguards.

27:27.921 --> 27:29.889
There must have been 20 or 30 of them!

27:29.956 --> 27:31.423
- These big...
- Black guys!

27:31.491 --> 27:32.924
Yeah, black guys.

27:32.992 --> 27:36.291
- Yeah, with chains!
- Chains, clubs, they had everything.

27:36.362 --> 27:38.626
They had pipes, bats, they had everything!

27:38.698 --> 27:40.359
All right, all right!

27:41.267 --> 27:43.701
So the broad wants to play tough, huh?

27:45.104 --> 27:46.435
All right.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.108
Two of us can play that game.

27:50.710 --> 27:53.201
Hey, Rock! Come here.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.550
I got a little job for you.

28:02.021 --> 28:03.283
The tank?

28:05.024 --> 28:07.083
Bring her back in one piece, will you?

28:08.261 --> 28:12.220
Chinese GoJu is my secret, I bear no arms.

28:12.498 --> 28:14.898
May God help me
if I ever have to use my art.

28:17.670 --> 28:20.230
Conscience is our guide.

28:20.306 --> 28:22.797
Peace is our shelter.

28:22.875 --> 28:26.572
Beauty and perfection is our life.

28:26.646 --> 28:28.045
See the courtesy.

28:30.450 --> 28:32.782
Kis-Kay! Break!

28:45.231 --> 28:47.096
Johnny, what are you doing?

28:47.867 --> 28:51.098
Well, you see, Leroy,
you know how you're always teaching us...

28:51.170 --> 28:54.298
...to master the art of fighting
without fighting?

28:54.507 --> 28:56.236
Well, I did you one better.

28:56.309 --> 28:59.870
I mastered the art of fighting
without knowing how to fight.

29:00.246 --> 29:03.613
You see, people...
People are afraid of Oriental dudes.

29:04.150 --> 29:08.746
Give them a little move, a little scream,
and lots of attitude.

29:09.389 --> 29:10.913
Check this out.

29:24.871 --> 29:28.500
Johnny, to seek safety
one must go to the heart of danger.

29:44.290 --> 29:49.057
The sign outside says this here school
is for instructions in the martial arts.

29:49.729 --> 29:54.063
- We thought we might get some lessons.
- Yeah, where do we sign up?

29:54.167 --> 29:56.499
- How many yen?
- I'd like to learn some kung fu.

29:56.569 --> 29:59.504
- Come on, hot stuff!
- Come on, Leroy.

29:59.939 --> 30:02.032
Teach me something.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.435
I do not wish to fight you.

30:05.144 --> 30:08.204
Well, who do you "wish" to fight then?

30:08.648 --> 30:09.842
One of them?

30:09.949 --> 30:11.814
Or one of the ladies, maybe?

30:11.951 --> 30:14.715
Yeah, since you're too much
of a sissy to fight me...

30:14.787 --> 30:16.880
...maybe they're more your speed.

30:17.590 --> 30:18.614
Get him, girls.

30:18.691 --> 30:21.421
Maybe you can get a rise
out of this limp wimp!

30:25.898 --> 30:28.093
- You wanna wrestle?
- Hey, little girl.

30:28.167 --> 30:30.533
All you've got is this bod and that's it.

30:30.603 --> 30:34.232
I would love to peel this banana.

30:34.307 --> 30:37.367
Come on, handsome, show us your stuff!

30:37.443 --> 30:40.435
How about a little kiss on my fist?

30:41.347 --> 30:43.872
He's too much of a gentleman to hit a lady.

30:46.352 --> 30:48.217
You look scared to me!

30:49.422 --> 30:51.856
Yeah! Come on, Leroy!

30:59.332 --> 31:02.062
- Yeah, that's right! Bow, sucker!
- Yeah!

31:02.535 --> 31:05.095
Bow down to your master!

31:05.571 --> 31:09.302
Yeah, coolie, kiss my Converse!

31:11.244 --> 31:13.769
- So sorry. Excuse, please.
- Bow!

31:25.258 --> 31:26.418
Bow!

31:29.362 --> 31:30.624
Enough!

31:30.830 --> 31:32.229
You want to fight?

31:32.331 --> 31:37.132
You fight me, you big ugly,
smelly-breathed sucker!

31:39.605 --> 31:43.006
How about you, string bean,
Rick-James-lookin' fool?

31:43.109 --> 31:44.701
Beast, kill him!

31:49.348 --> 31:50.838
Get him, Beast!

31:56.222 --> 32:00.784
Bow down or I'm gonna snap
this clown in two!

32:01.994 --> 32:04.326
Yeah, that's right, fool!

32:05.865 --> 32:06.889
Kiss 'em!

32:09.168 --> 32:10.260
Down!

32:19.078 --> 32:20.670
Beast, let him go.

32:23.783 --> 32:26.479
You may not wish to fight me now, sucker!

32:27.386 --> 32:30.253
But you will! I'm gonna see to that!

32:31.591 --> 32:33.115
Sayonara.

32:34.594 --> 32:36.824
- Who's the master?
- Sho'nuff!

32:36.896 --> 32:38.727
- Who's the master?
- Sho'nuff!

32:40.933 --> 32:42.491
The Shogun of Harlem!

32:42.602 --> 32:43.364
Yeah!

32:48.407 --> 32:52.241
Sometimes it is hard
to live the way of the wise.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.377
Hey, Reloy!

32:58.451 --> 33:01.318
Your papa-san,
he wants you in the kitchen, man!

33:09.362 --> 33:11.592
Good morning, Green Sanitarium,
Warden speaking...

33:11.664 --> 33:15.156
...and I must say our inmates
are off to a promising start this morning.

33:15.234 --> 33:17.065
Who's calling? Roy!

33:17.904 --> 33:19.064
I can't come now.

33:19.138 --> 33:22.835
I'm being held captive till the coolie,
moonie kid comes down from the roof.

33:22.909 --> 33:25.275
He's becoming one with his brain again.

33:25.378 --> 33:26.470
Yeah.

33:26.712 --> 33:29.510
All right, I'll catch you later
at the rehearsal.

33:33.819 --> 33:35.548
Hey, let me get this straight.

33:35.621 --> 33:38.784
The prize in this contest,
you hope to win, is a date?

33:38.958 --> 33:40.289
"Am" gonna win.

33:40.426 --> 33:43.293
And it ain't no thing
and the prize ain't no date.

33:43.362 --> 33:46.695
- A night with Laura Charles is an event.
- Excuse me.

33:47.900 --> 33:50.460
Mama-san, Papa-san...

33:51.170 --> 33:55.470
...Richie-san, Lotus Blossom-san.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.102
Now isn't that nice, Sophia?

34:00.179 --> 34:02.044
Pretty chopsticks, Natasha.

34:02.114 --> 34:05.379
Thank you.

34:05.885 --> 34:09.252
I wish you all would decide on one name
for this poor child.

34:09.322 --> 34:11.187
No wonder she's so confused.

34:11.257 --> 34:12.417
Bless this food.

34:12.491 --> 34:15.551
It is to build thy body temple.
Spiritualize it.

34:15.928 --> 34:18.021
I'm telling you, Pop, the boy is off it.

34:18.097 --> 34:20.621
Stupid old clothes,
won't mess with no babes.

34:20.866 --> 34:22.264
People talk, you know.

34:22.335 --> 34:24.235
Richard, leave your brother alone.

34:24.303 --> 34:26.293
I can't help it if he's weird.

34:26.405 --> 34:28.202
You're weird, man, really weird.

34:28.274 --> 34:31.869
Richie, when I first started my business,
people said I was weird.

34:32.277 --> 34:34.178
A black man with a pizza shop.

34:34.246 --> 34:38.114
Now there isn't a hungry soul in this town
that doesn't know my slogan:

34:38.284 --> 34:41.411
"Just direct-a-yo feets-a to Daddy Green's...

34:41.520 --> 34:42.509
"Pizza."

34:44.090 --> 34:45.580
Watch yourself, son.

34:46.158 --> 34:49.456
My personal choices
for the video hotpix of the week...

34:49.562 --> 34:51.052
That's my babe, Pop!

34:51.297 --> 34:52.855
That's my date for tonight!

34:52.931 --> 34:57.027
Because it's alive and very, very exciting.

34:57.670 --> 34:59.661
- That is her!
- You telling me?

34:59.739 --> 35:02.537
You better believe that's her!
That's Laura Charles!

35:02.608 --> 35:06.100
So you remember now,
every weekday night at 8:00.

35:06.278 --> 35:07.768
Laura Charles!

35:07.980 --> 35:10.744
- I would like to see her!
- Well, who wouldn't, fool?

35:10.816 --> 35:12.306
"I would like to see her."

35:12.385 --> 35:15.980
No way the Queen is gonna be looking at
no walkin' fortune cookie!

35:16.055 --> 35:17.784
"I would like to see her."

35:18.357 --> 35:21.724
- Well, I'll see her today, at rehearsal.
- You know where she is?

35:21.794 --> 35:24.661
- I know where she's gonna be.
- You must take me to see her!

35:24.730 --> 35:25.992
I ain't taking you nowhere!

35:26.065 --> 35:27.430
You might embarrass me.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.127
You're too weird.

35:33.739 --> 35:35.263
You do not understand.

35:35.341 --> 35:36.968
She may have something I need.

35:37.043 --> 35:39.238
I knew it would happen sooner or later.

35:39.311 --> 35:41.745
You stood on your head so long,
you broke it.

35:42.148 --> 35:44.082
Look, let me break it down for you.

35:44.150 --> 35:47.551
You seem to be wanting to broaden,
get it, your horizons.

35:47.920 --> 35:51.947
You let a lot of good years roll by
without even testing the old equipment.

35:52.158 --> 35:56.527
Now, even you being a disgrace and all,
I'd be less than a man if I didn't warn you...

35:56.595 --> 36:00.691
...that there's an art to making love
and you don't even have a paintbrush.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.258
You gotta know the moves, baby.
You know, the moves.

36:06.505 --> 36:09.201
Richie, I am not concerned with moves.

36:09.341 --> 36:11.866
My concern is something else.

36:12.011 --> 36:13.876
Else? What else is there?

36:14.046 --> 36:16.674
Please, I must see her.

36:17.850 --> 36:20.045
I don't see why I'm getting so upset.

36:20.119 --> 36:24.522
Go on, go after a goddess if you want to,
but let me tell you something.

36:25.391 --> 36:28.724
The worst thing that can happen to you
is that she says "yes."

36:28.794 --> 36:32.560
'Cause ain't no woman like that
going to hold still while you figure it out.

36:32.631 --> 36:35.259
Not only do you not know
when to do something...

36:35.334 --> 36:38.064
...you wouldn't know where to put it
if you did!

36:39.572 --> 36:40.937
And, Leroy...

36:42.541 --> 36:45.806
...it can really hurt if you don't know
what you're doing.

36:45.911 --> 36:48.641
Richie, I must go to this dance contest!

36:49.381 --> 36:52.077
I ain't taking you nowhere and that's final!

36:54.687 --> 36:55.881
Please!

36:57.857 --> 36:59.324
Kiss my hand.

36:59.492 --> 37:01.323
Richie, please.

37:02.027 --> 37:03.654
Maybe I'll take you...

37:03.763 --> 37:07.859
...if you carry me all the way
on your back and rap.

37:08.234 --> 37:09.701
- Rap? Me?
- Yeah!

37:09.769 --> 37:10.369
"Smell like"
I think I have it.

37:10.369 --> 37:11.768
"Smell like"
I think I have it.

37:11.837 --> 37:16.274
"What it is, what it look like, do it

37:16.342 --> 37:17.536
"Yeah, baby

37:17.610 --> 37:21.137
"Do it, do it. What it, what it be like"

37:22.348 --> 37:24.282
Okay! That's it! That's it!

37:24.350 --> 37:25.977
That is it, stop!

37:26.418 --> 37:27.942
Stop right here.

37:28.053 --> 37:30.044
It's just pitiful.

37:30.122 --> 37:32.647
- Well, give me one more chance!
- No. It is pitiful.

37:32.725 --> 37:34.124
Put me down.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.291
Put me down!

37:37.797 --> 37:39.025
It's pitiful.

37:46.939 --> 37:50.340
Richie, where are you going?
Are you not going to buy tickets?

37:56.215 --> 37:58.683
Of course, I'm gonna buy a ticket!

37:59.585 --> 38:03.749
I never buy tickets,
you shrimp-fried-rice head, you.

38:04.657 --> 38:07.558
Man, if anyone asks you,
you ain't my brother, okay?

38:07.626 --> 38:08.718
What?

38:09.128 --> 38:11.824
You ain't my brother, that's all!
Now, come on!

38:19.238 --> 38:20.603
Come on, move it!

38:32.484 --> 38:36.477
See man, messing around with you,
now my boys don't even know I'm here.

38:36.789 --> 38:39.383
You're not trying to enter
without paying, are you?

38:39.458 --> 38:41.892
Chill out, chopsticks. Let me handle this.

38:42.661 --> 38:44.458
There must be another door.

38:46.365 --> 38:49.232
I'll be back.
Just stay right here and don't move.

38:49.368 --> 38:53.600
- And if anyone asks, remember...
- I know, I ain't your brother.

39:12.057 --> 39:14.116
Why wasn't this sound check done sooner?

39:14.193 --> 39:17.993
I don't know. I only do what I'm told.
You know, we try for perfection.

39:18.464 --> 39:19.590
Help!

39:29.742 --> 39:31.209
Help!

39:42.488 --> 39:42.755
"I found a picture

39:42.755 --> 39:44.222
"I found a picture

39:45.824 --> 39:47.792
"Inside your suitcase

39:48.827 --> 39:51.489

40:58.330 --> 41:00.025
Don't you love it?

41:00.232 --> 41:03.463
Look, doll, did I do you a favor
or did I do you a favor?

41:03.869 --> 41:06.167
So you're going to play my video?

41:06.705 --> 41:07.729
No!

41:10.109 --> 41:12.168
Maybe you didn't hear it right...

41:13.178 --> 41:15.442
...so I'm going to ask you one more time.

41:16.515 --> 41:19.382
Are you going to put my video
on your show or aren't you?

41:19.451 --> 41:23.148
I'm going to tell you one more time.
The answer is "no."

41:25.324 --> 41:26.985
It's not that I don't like it.

41:27.059 --> 41:29.789
- It's just that it's not the right...
- Right!

41:30.529 --> 41:32.997
Right time of the night to look at it.

41:33.065 --> 41:35.363
That's what she was going to say,
wasn't it, honey?

41:35.434 --> 41:38.335
Eddie, she's just tired.

41:39.171 --> 41:40.536
Tired?

41:40.806 --> 41:43.639
She's going to be dead tired
if she's not careful.

41:44.243 --> 41:46.803
Okay, I tried to be a gentleman about this!

41:46.945 --> 41:49.470
I was going to take you out
to a fancy restaurant.

41:49.548 --> 41:51.311
Let you order à la carte!

41:51.617 --> 41:55.781
All I wanted you to do was to put my video
on your show, and now you say "no."

41:57.656 --> 41:59.851
Okay, that's it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.

41:59.925 --> 42:01.256
Rock, let's go.

42:02.094 --> 42:04.654
Eddie, you're not gonna do
what I think you are?

42:04.730 --> 42:06.357
Who's going to stop me?

42:08.367 --> 42:10.335
Who is this guy? We didn't order out.

42:10.402 --> 42:13.337
Get him the hell out of here!
Get him outta here now!

42:18.577 --> 42:20.306
Who is this guy? Get in there!

42:20.379 --> 42:22.210
Break his face, will you?

42:27.453 --> 42:29.614
What are you guys waiting for? Get going!

42:29.688 --> 42:31.451
Are you on vacation? Move it!

42:31.523 --> 42:32.990
Get in there!

42:43.569 --> 42:44.900
Get going!

42:56.982 --> 42:58.449
I'm sorry, Miss...

42:58.517 --> 43:01.577
Angela. Angela Viracco.

43:05.424 --> 43:06.516
Bums!

43:08.594 --> 43:11.688
I do not think Miss Charles
enjoys your company.

43:12.564 --> 43:15.089
It would be best that you leave her alone!

43:15.767 --> 43:19.931
I don't know who you are, pal,
but you're in a lot of trouble!

43:23.008 --> 43:25.602
Hothead needs cool water.

43:26.745 --> 43:28.804
No, no, no!

43:28.981 --> 43:31.142
No, not the tank!

43:36.688 --> 43:37.746
No!

43:39.791 --> 43:40.951
Eddie!

43:42.027 --> 43:44.086
Come, you will be safe now.

43:46.098 --> 43:49.226
- Eddie, are you all right?
- Get away from me, you dumb broad!

43:49.301 --> 43:52.327
But Eddie, you're all wet!

43:52.638 --> 43:54.367
Honey!

43:58.343 --> 44:02.177
Look at this, it's all wet. You're all wet.

44:02.247 --> 44:04.511
Rock, get this damn thing out of here.

44:04.583 --> 44:06.881
That son of a bitch is history.

44:12.291 --> 44:14.919
God, I can't believe this!

44:14.993 --> 44:17.120
This is enough to drive you crazy.

44:17.529 --> 44:19.724
You do this kind of thing everyday?

44:20.032 --> 44:21.397
You are too much!

44:23.168 --> 44:24.567
Who are you?

44:24.770 --> 44:26.032
I am Leroy.

44:26.138 --> 44:27.537
Leroy Green.

44:27.806 --> 44:31.173
It's nice to meet you.

44:32.144 --> 44:33.611
I need a drink.

44:33.679 --> 44:35.442
Why don't you come inside?

44:38.283 --> 44:41.844
Miss Charles, there is something
you may be able to help me with.

44:41.920 --> 44:43.478
You can call me Laura.

44:43.622 --> 44:45.988
Laura, the other night
I lost a medallion and...

44:46.391 --> 44:49.155
That thing that looks like a belt buckle?

44:49.228 --> 44:50.252
Belt buckle?

44:50.596 --> 44:51.961
Is it gold?

44:52.331 --> 44:53.355
You have it?

44:53.432 --> 44:54.592
Yeah, I got it.

44:54.666 --> 44:57.362
Why don't you sit down?
I'll go get it for you.

45:00.839 --> 45:02.238
That is wonderful!

45:02.708 --> 45:04.767
Just promise that you won't vanish...

45:04.843 --> 45:07.038
...as soon as I give it back to you.

45:43.782 --> 45:46.148
This is so you'll never lose it again.

45:46.585 --> 45:48.576
I am deeply in your debt.

45:53.992 --> 45:55.721
It is very valuable to me.

45:58.530 --> 46:01.260
I know what it's like
to lose precious things...

46:02.567 --> 46:05.468
...and then, of course, to find them again.

46:07.539 --> 46:08.938
You thirsty?

46:14.980 --> 46:18.711
From the clock's chime to the cock's crow
is but an instant.

46:20.585 --> 46:21.916
I must go.

46:23.722 --> 46:25.212
Excuse me.

46:26.825 --> 46:28.156
I'm sorry.

46:32.798 --> 46:34.197
Cock's crow?

46:38.203 --> 46:38.437
"Suki yaki hot saki Sue

46:38.437 --> 46:40.428
"Suki yaki hot saki Sue

46:40.772 --> 46:43.798
"You saki to me, I saki to you

46:45.344 --> 46:51.044
"Suki yaki hot saki Sue
You saki to me, I saki to you

46:52.651 --> 46:56.519
"Hot like saki wine
Here she stands

46:56.722 --> 47:00.180
"Smooth and fine, looking good

47:00.625 --> 47:03.594
"And she knows what she's after

47:04.463 --> 47:06.658
"Watch out for that hook!

47:07.265 --> 47:10.359
"She baits the line
and starts to move in closer

47:10.936 --> 47:13.905
"He takes a step away

47:14.206 --> 47:17.835
"Watch the hook
She's never missed her target

47:19.211 --> 47:21.202
"Now she can say

47:22.447 --> 47:25.348
"With your bad self, I saki to you!

47:27.252 --> 47:29.914
"And I can say, good times

47:30.856 --> 47:33.950
"You saki to me, I saki to you

47:35.360 --> 47:36.952
"Suki yaki hot saki Sue"

47:48.073 --> 47:49.233
All right!

47:52.210 --> 47:52.377
What you lookin' for?

47:52.377 --> 47:53.571
What you lookin' for?

47:53.645 --> 47:55.272
I am looking for the Master.

47:55.347 --> 47:57.212
Ain't no masters here, dude.

47:57.282 --> 47:59.182
Ain't no slaves either!

48:02.254 --> 48:04.484
Is this not his fortune cookie factory?

48:04.556 --> 48:07.389
The Master, he doin' his wisdom thing.

48:08.794 --> 48:10.921
I seek only wisdom of the Master.

48:11.062 --> 48:13.792
You want wisdom, you buy fortune cookie.

48:14.032 --> 48:16.125
- Take a hike, cool breeze.
- Yeah, baby.

48:16.201 --> 48:18.135
Please, I must see the Master.

48:18.203 --> 48:20.797
- It is very important to me.
- Look here, chump.

48:20.872 --> 48:24.865
The Master don't see nobody,
especially no jive coolies!

48:24.943 --> 48:28.003
Yeah, he don't see no one
who don't know how to get down, baby!

48:28.079 --> 48:30.980
- You dig, bro? You too square, man!
- Square, dude!

48:31.049 --> 48:33.609
Let me say it so he can understand it, Jim.

48:37.122 --> 48:39.056
You go now! Chop-chop!

48:39.291 --> 48:41.418
Haulee ass outta this place!

48:42.060 --> 48:44.255
Am I sayin' it right, my man?

48:45.464 --> 48:47.728
Like, hasta la pasta, you know?

48:47.866 --> 48:50.391
- Buenas noches.
- Auf Wiedersehen, baby.

48:50.469 --> 48:51.993
- Hasta lumbago!
- Sayonara!

48:52.070 --> 48:54.470
- Catch you on the flip-flop!
- Sayonara!

48:57.709 --> 48:58.276
I was told I could find Leroy Green here.

48:58.276 --> 49:01.109
I was told I could find Leroy Green here.

49:05.183 --> 49:06.775
I'm Leroy Green.

49:07.052 --> 49:08.451
Who are you?

49:09.988 --> 49:11.319
Who am I?

49:12.290 --> 49:13.552
Sho'nuff!

49:16.394 --> 49:19.420
I am the Shogun of Harlem...

49:20.065 --> 49:22.795
...and the Leroy Green I'm lookin' for...

49:22.968 --> 49:26.426
...is a little punk that thinks
he's a kung fu master.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.074
You mean Junior?

49:31.142 --> 49:32.234
Yeah.

49:33.144 --> 49:35.339
"Junior."

49:35.647 --> 49:37.046
Where is he?

49:38.483 --> 49:39.848
Don't know.

49:39.918 --> 49:42.250
I'm not sure I'd tell you if I did!

49:42.621 --> 49:45.385
- Not sure you'd tell me if you did?
- Wait a minute!

49:45.457 --> 49:47.755
- Leave him alone!
- Please, Momma, wait a minute!

49:47.826 --> 49:50.420
Wait a minute, please. I'll take care of it.

49:50.495 --> 49:53.521
Well, how about I leave him
a little message, then?

49:54.633 --> 49:57.602
Tell him when I found out he wasn't here...

49:58.303 --> 50:00.794
...I was all broken up!

50:02.140 --> 50:04.540
My God, my table! What are you doing?

50:07.679 --> 50:09.704
Crunch, Beast, Cyclone!

50:09.848 --> 50:11.645
- Do it!
- With pleasure.

50:11.716 --> 50:14.344
- No!
- Call the police fast!

50:14.419 --> 50:16.979
- Please, don't do that!
- You stop it!

50:17.055 --> 50:18.852
Please, come on!

50:24.796 --> 50:26.127
Stop!

50:26.197 --> 50:27.926
No, don't break the table!

50:32.704 --> 50:34.331
I'm gonna kill you, fool!

50:34.406 --> 50:36.067
Take it easy, honey!

50:36.141 --> 50:38.109
What, are you crazy? He's the Beast!

50:38.176 --> 50:40.736
- She only hit you with dough!
- You gonna die!

50:40.812 --> 50:43.372
All right, enough is enough!
You all better chill out.

50:43.448 --> 50:46.906
- Richie, you stay out of this!
- You better chill out, man!

50:47.519 --> 50:49.714
I said chill out!

50:51.389 --> 50:54.552
All right, take it easy!

51:10.041 --> 51:12.202
Who plays this garbage?

51:13.078 --> 51:14.568
Shut up, bitch!

51:15.780 --> 51:17.213
That's not even mine!

51:17.282 --> 51:18.909
I don't own that!

51:26.591 --> 51:31.460
Tell that chicken-hearted son of yours
to name the place.

51:32.330 --> 51:34.457
'Cause now he's got to fight me.

51:40.939 --> 51:42.031
Yeah.

51:59.724 --> 52:01.055
Can I kick?

52:13.705 --> 52:15.798
Come on. I got you.

52:15.874 --> 52:17.535
Look at him!

52:17.642 --> 52:19.200
Oh, boy. Sit down.

52:19.277 --> 52:20.801
You all right, Rich?

52:21.112 --> 52:23.307
You all right now? Look at this!

52:33.425 --> 52:34.915
What happened?

52:35.527 --> 52:37.495
Sho'nuff happened, that's what!

52:37.562 --> 52:39.086
It's all 'cause of you!

52:39.164 --> 52:41.155
Everyone knows you're scared of him.

52:41.232 --> 52:43.564
You kissed his shoes and everything.

52:43.935 --> 52:47.268
What good is that kung fu jive
if you can't even use it?

52:47.338 --> 52:48.703
Coward!

52:50.208 --> 52:52.972
Why don't you go someplace
and meditate on that?

53:18.870 --> 53:20.235
Coward!

53:34.352 --> 53:36.479
Chinese GoJu is my secret!

53:36.688 --> 53:39.623
May God help me
if I ever have to use my art!

53:40.325 --> 53:41.724
Love is our law!

53:42.093 --> 53:43.890
Truth is our worship!

53:44.462 --> 53:46.327
Form is our manifestation!

53:46.498 --> 53:48.466
Conscience is our guide!

53:50.635 --> 53:52.432
Peace is our shelter.

53:55.640 --> 53:58.006
Peace is my shelter.

54:05.383 --> 54:06.850
Peace is...

54:17.996 --> 54:18.997
Hello?

54:20.865 --> 54:21.923
Hey!

54:24.369 --> 54:26.667
I don't mean to bother you but...

54:27.071 --> 54:29.972
...maybe I should just come back
another time, huh?

54:31.876 --> 54:35.505
Listen, if this is a bad time,
you know, I can just...

54:38.216 --> 54:41.515
You know, the strangest things
keep happening to me.

54:42.053 --> 54:46.547
I mean, I seem to be attracting
the craziest people.

54:47.192 --> 54:50.457
So, I thought that maybe
it would be a great idea...

54:50.528 --> 54:53.725
...if I got myself a bodyguard, you know?

54:54.833 --> 54:58.234
Like, someone to guard my body.

55:00.772 --> 55:04.003
Anyway, you seem to be the best qualified.
I mean...

55:04.509 --> 55:07.000
...a girl could do worse
than to have her own...

55:07.078 --> 55:09.205
...real, live kung fu master.

55:09.647 --> 55:11.376
I am no master.

55:15.320 --> 55:17.754
You sure look like a master to me.

55:24.062 --> 55:25.529
How about it?

55:26.030 --> 55:27.554
How about what?

55:28.132 --> 55:29.463
Bodyguard.

55:29.868 --> 55:31.733
- Hello?
- Bodyguard?

55:31.903 --> 55:33.996
I want you to be my bodyguard.

55:34.138 --> 55:36.072
Have you listened to a thing I've said?

55:36.140 --> 55:39.041
There is much I must do.
I am sorry. I cannot.

55:39.410 --> 55:41.071
Leroy!

55:43.181 --> 55:44.808
Excuse me!

55:45.550 --> 55:47.518
- That's okay.
- Say...

55:48.753 --> 55:50.414
...you're Laura Charles!

55:50.989 --> 55:53.423
Forget it. I will go. Don't...

55:53.524 --> 55:55.583
- That's okay.
- I don't want to bother you.

55:55.660 --> 55:57.184
It's okay, I was just leaving.

55:57.262 --> 55:58.251
Leaving?

55:58.897 --> 56:01.559
Please, just give it some thought, okay?

56:01.766 --> 56:04.098
Wow! Laura Charles!

56:06.404 --> 56:09.134
Just let me know if you change your mind.

56:09.440 --> 56:11.635
I said I cannot help you.

56:11.943 --> 56:15.276
He can't help you?
Of course he can help you!

56:15.346 --> 56:17.041
Look at that, he's just hot!

56:17.115 --> 56:19.106
He's sick. The boy's...

56:19.183 --> 56:20.207
All that yoga.

56:20.285 --> 56:22.276
Hi, my name is Johnny Yu.

56:22.420 --> 56:24.081
It's a pleasure to meet you.

56:24.155 --> 56:26.350
Hi, Johnny, it's nice to meet you.

56:31.195 --> 56:33.720
She said it was nice to meet me!

56:34.399 --> 56:36.993
Laura Charles said it was nice to meet me!

56:37.101 --> 56:39.262
She said it was nice!

56:39.804 --> 56:40.771
She...

56:42.407 --> 56:43.499
Yeah.

56:45.043 --> 56:46.305
This is your résumé?

56:47.111 --> 56:49.705
I like the cropping on that picture.

56:50.848 --> 56:52.816
You did "the incinerator murder"?

56:52.884 --> 56:56.411
Yeah, I trashed the little lady.

57:06.130 --> 57:07.427
Double?

57:10.935 --> 57:12.926
Why do you think you should get double...

57:13.004 --> 57:15.404
...what everybody else is getting, huh?

57:19.944 --> 57:21.434
Beautiful!

57:21.512 --> 57:23.139
Save it!

57:23.748 --> 57:25.716
Give that man anything he wants!

57:25.783 --> 57:27.375
Give him a bone.

57:29.253 --> 57:31.153
Make sure you take out for the table, huh?

57:31.389 --> 57:33.823
"You look at me like a new pickup

57:33.925 --> 57:36.359
"You tell the barman, 'Fill her up'

57:36.894 --> 57:39.192
"You try to steer me out the door

57:39.597 --> 57:41.895
"But I know what you're cruising for

57:42.166 --> 57:46.967
"You want a test drive

57:47.672 --> 57:49.503
"You want a free ride down

57:49.574 --> 57:52.907
"Lovers' Lane tonight"

57:57.949 --> 57:59.883
All right, that's enough!

57:59.951 --> 58:01.942
- Looks terrific, sweetheart.
- Yeah?

58:02.020 --> 58:05.547
Just needs a couple more steps, okay?
And you girls looked great, too.

58:05.623 --> 58:08.683
Listen, why don't you take a break
and get outta those clothes?

58:08.760 --> 58:10.421
Here are some quarters.

58:10.561 --> 58:12.825
Go have a good time. I'll talk to you, girls.

58:12.897 --> 58:14.558
- Go, go!
- 'Bye, girls!

58:14.632 --> 58:15.833
- 'Bye, baby.
- Ciao, Angie, baby.

58:15.833 --> 58:16.993
- 'Bye, baby.
- Ciao, Angie, baby.

58:17.168 --> 58:21.764
You know, to tell you the truth,
Eddie, I'm really getting tired of all this.

58:22.373 --> 58:27.174
I mean that deejay lady,
she's never gonna play our stuff, anyway.

58:27.245 --> 58:28.303
She'll see the light...

58:28.379 --> 58:31.371
...as soon as I get that Leroy character
out of the way.

58:34.218 --> 58:36.186
What do you mean "out of the way"?

58:36.254 --> 58:39.655
Sweetheart, you should see the talent
I got lined up out there.

58:40.291 --> 58:43.749
If this deejay broad don't wise up,
she's gonna be dessert.

58:44.429 --> 58:46.522
It's all for you, sweetheart.

58:47.031 --> 58:48.692
All to make you a star.

58:48.966 --> 58:51.560
Now what do you think of your lover-boy?

58:52.003 --> 58:53.630
All for me?

58:54.105 --> 58:56.073
All for you, sweetheart.

58:56.674 --> 59:00.041
Well, I mean, if it's really all for me...

59:02.680 --> 59:05.444
I don't want you to kill anybody.

59:05.983 --> 59:07.883
Are you out of your mind?

59:07.985 --> 59:10.715
Nobody does what he did to me and lives!
Nobody!

59:16.794 --> 59:19.228
You know what I've been thinking, Eddie?

59:19.864 --> 59:23.960
I've been thinking that maybe you're trying
to use me to get what you want.

59:24.902 --> 59:27.962
I mean, just like you tried to use Rock.

59:28.339 --> 59:31.775
Yeah, you were gonna make him
this big heavyweight champion.

59:32.143 --> 59:34.668
Sure, until he lost a fight.

59:35.613 --> 59:38.377
All this glamour and stardom...

59:39.317 --> 59:41.581
...it's all for you, isn't it, Eddie?

59:46.724 --> 59:48.191
You know, Angie...

59:49.760 --> 59:53.423
...a lot of girls out there
would like to trade places with you.

59:54.432 --> 59:56.366
If you're unhappy with all of this...

59:56.434 --> 59:58.493
...why don't you just walk out?

01:00:00.838 --> 01:00:03.500
Go have a nice, normal, boring life.

01:00:07.111 --> 01:00:10.137
To tell you the truth, Eddie,
it couldn't be anymore boring...

01:00:10.214 --> 01:00:12.648
...than hanging around
with this gook in my hair...

01:00:12.717 --> 01:00:14.947
...while you guys go play cops and robbers.

01:00:15.019 --> 01:00:16.953
Where are you gonna go, Angie?

01:00:17.054 --> 01:00:18.851
Without me, you're nothing!

01:00:18.923 --> 01:00:22.586
Without that outfit, you're just another
no-talent, dental school dropout...

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.652
...from Kew Gardens gettin' by on her tits!

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.194
In the end, Eddie, you know what?

01:00:33.437 --> 01:00:36.372
You're nothing but a misguided,
midget asshole...

01:00:36.474 --> 01:00:38.965
...with dreams of ruling the world!

01:00:40.745 --> 01:00:44.237
Yeah, also from Kew Gardens.

01:00:47.351 --> 01:00:50.286
And also getting by on my tits.

01:00:54.892 --> 01:00:57.053
Where do you think you're going?

01:00:57.128 --> 01:00:58.857
To elocution class!

01:01:00.765 --> 01:01:02.096
What for?

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.718
Did you see that?

01:01:30.795 --> 01:01:32.695
Sho'nuff is the master!

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.995
- Number one!
- Can I pick 'em or what?

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.967
Shut up!

01:01:39.036 --> 01:01:41.596
- Am I the meanest?
- Sho'nuff!

01:01:41.672 --> 01:01:44.539
- Am I the prettiest?
- Sho'nuff!

01:01:44.642 --> 01:01:48.203
Am I the baddest mo-fo
lowdown around this town?

01:01:48.279 --> 01:01:49.507
Sho'nuff!

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.275
I can't hear you!

01:01:51.382 --> 01:01:52.644
Sho'nuff!

01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:54.048
Yeah!

01:02:04.528 --> 01:02:05.893
Keep your money.

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:09.663
You just get that sucker
to the designated place...

01:02:09.734 --> 01:02:11.827
...at the designated time...

01:02:12.169 --> 01:02:15.297
...and I will gladly designate his ass...

01:02:15.373 --> 01:02:17.307
...for dismemberment!

01:02:17.808 --> 01:02:20.106
Yeah! Hey! Well, whatever!

01:02:20.878 --> 01:02:22.812
Anyway you want to do it.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.781
It'll certainly be my pleasure, Mr. Nuff.

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:32.153
Put it away. Come on.

01:02:46.804 --> 01:02:48.669
- Looking for me?
- Yes.

01:02:48.739 --> 01:02:50.172
I mean...

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:53.505
I thought I wasn't exactly
on your favorite persons' list.

01:02:53.611 --> 01:02:56.978
That is why I came by,
to apologize for the way I spoke.

01:02:57.048 --> 01:02:59.278
I did not mean it towards you.

01:02:59.517 --> 01:03:00.882
Great.

01:03:01.018 --> 01:03:03.145
Then you'll be my bodyguard?

01:03:03.254 --> 01:03:06.621
I'd love to, but I must complete
a mission first.

01:03:07.458 --> 01:03:08.789
A mission?

01:03:09.026 --> 01:03:14.225
You see, I am in search of the final level
where the spirit takes over...

01:03:14.298 --> 01:03:17.665
...from the mind
and guides the body without thought.

01:03:17.768 --> 01:03:21.226
Okay. Listen, you stay right here, okay?

01:03:21.305 --> 01:03:23.398
Don't move. I'll be back in five minutes.

01:03:23.474 --> 01:03:25.772
Don't disappear, okay? I'll be right back.

01:03:26.444 --> 01:03:28.139
A great fighter, for instance...

01:03:28.212 --> 01:03:31.477
...might be able to get just his hands
to fill with such power...

01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:35.542
...that they would get the glow, which
could be deadly if it fell into evil hands.

01:03:35.619 --> 01:03:38.417
Yet, if these hands belonged to a master...

01:03:38.489 --> 01:03:39.786
Like Bruce Lee.

01:03:39.857 --> 01:03:41.324
Yes, exactly!

01:03:41.792 --> 01:03:45.660
Someone who has reached the final level
and could make his whole body glow...

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:49.564
...the beauty he would be able to create
would be without bounds.

01:03:50.735 --> 01:03:54.535
Imagine the wonder someone like this
can bring to the world!

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.899
That's a beautiful dream, Leroy.

01:03:57.975 --> 01:04:01.809
Now I know you're gonna love
what I've got to show you at the studio.

01:04:03.681 --> 01:04:05.148
What's wrong?

01:04:06.517 --> 01:04:08.007
Calling Leroy.

01:04:09.787 --> 01:04:11.778
I am sorry, but it's just...

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:15.786
What? Tell me. Come on.

01:04:16.761 --> 01:04:18.661
You see, I have this friend.

01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:21.354
- Yeah?
- He is very shy.

01:04:21.532 --> 01:04:24.057
He came to me for advice. And I...

01:04:25.102 --> 01:04:26.296
...well...

01:04:27.838 --> 01:04:31.137
It is something I thought
you can help me with, him with.

01:04:33.377 --> 01:04:34.901
Okay, I'll try.

01:04:35.146 --> 01:04:37.137
Tell me about it. What is it?

01:04:38.215 --> 01:04:39.443
Moves.

01:04:40.017 --> 01:04:41.177
Moves?

01:04:43.854 --> 01:04:45.048
You see...

01:04:45.156 --> 01:04:47.989
...my friend, he has never been...

01:04:48.359 --> 01:04:49.792
He likes this girl.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:52.852
- Yeah?
- He has never been with a woman before.

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:55.125
He does not even have a paintbrush.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.162
Paintbrush?

01:04:57.234 --> 01:04:59.099
He cannot even draw.

01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:01.934
- Draw? What are you talking about?
- You know.

01:05:02.373 --> 01:05:04.568
The art of making love.

01:05:04.642 --> 01:05:07.543
- Moves.
- Of course.

01:05:08.979 --> 01:05:11.447
- I would love to show you some moves.
- No!

01:05:11.515 --> 01:05:13.949
It's not for me. I said it was for my friend.

01:05:14.018 --> 01:05:15.508
He is the one.

01:05:16.554 --> 01:05:18.454
Okay, anything you say.

01:05:27.031 --> 01:05:29.295
Is it not kind of hot in here, Miss Charles?

01:05:29.667 --> 01:05:31.897
I'm telling you, I don't need a contest...

01:05:31.969 --> 01:05:34.062
...to win this date 'cause I got juice!

01:05:34.138 --> 01:05:35.605
Why don't you just give up?

01:05:35.673 --> 01:05:39.439
Your delusions of grandeur about love
with her is nothin' but a wet dream.

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:41.068
Don't be no fool, Jack.

01:05:41.712 --> 01:05:44.545
The Baron Von Rick's got
a more direct route to the target.

01:05:44.615 --> 01:05:46.708
Watch out the target
don't shoot you down.

01:05:46.784 --> 01:05:50.015
- Why don't you write her a letter?
- Or make an obscene phone call?

01:05:50.087 --> 01:05:52.487
'Cause that's as close as you're gonna get.

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.681
You two play a game if you want to.

01:05:54.758 --> 01:05:57.727
I'm gonna sit right here
and wait for her to show up.

01:05:58.128 --> 01:06:00.392
And the rap I'm gonna lay on her...

01:06:00.464 --> 01:06:03.194
...is gonna make Romeo seem tongue-tied.

01:06:03.267 --> 01:06:07.033
Make her melt like hot butter
all over my body!

01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:08.770
Go, Rick!

01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:12.104
And this time ain't nothin' gonna stand
between me and my destiny...

01:06:12.176 --> 01:06:14.872
...with the sweet lips of Lady Laura!

01:06:15.546 --> 01:06:17.810
Wow! This place is great!

01:06:48.712 --> 01:06:50.304
Fists of Fury!

01:07:48.772 --> 01:07:50.899
That's it, man. Enough is enough.

01:07:51.108 --> 01:07:53.372
- I'm gonna go.
- Wait a minute!

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:55.309
Something's going on in here.

01:07:55.379 --> 01:07:57.244
You think it's her?

01:07:57.681 --> 01:08:00.149
There's only one way to find out.
Come on!

01:08:00.484 --> 01:08:02.247
What? Where are we going?

01:08:07.124 --> 01:08:08.386
Shit!

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.587
- Forget it, man.
- Wait up, man!

01:08:41.959 --> 01:08:43.448
This is great!

01:09:39.015 --> 01:09:42.952
Man, I ought to slap that sucker silly
with a suit for alienation of affections!

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:45.648
If it wasn't for me,
he wouldn't even know where she was!

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:47.384
Chocolate-covered yellow peril!

01:09:47.457 --> 01:09:48.482
Chill out, man!

01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:51.118
Wait for me, will you?
Come on, man, wait for me!

01:09:51.627 --> 01:09:54.859
That sucker better start sleeping
with his inscrutable eyes open...

01:09:55.032 --> 01:09:59.196
...'cause there's gonna be a serious case
of chopsockie justice coming his way!

01:09:59.269 --> 01:10:00.827
Maybe you just don't understand him.

01:10:00.904 --> 01:10:04.067
I mean, if the lady likes him,
he must be doing something right.

01:10:04.141 --> 01:10:06.575
Leroy? He wouldn't even know
what to do with that!

01:10:06.643 --> 01:10:08.543
Looked like he was doing all right to me.

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:20.718
What's that?

01:10:23.994 --> 01:10:25.393
Chinese Connection.

01:10:25.462 --> 01:10:29.091
He has disguised himself in order to...

01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:36.095
...get into the villains' lair!

01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:42.074
Why did I not think of that before?

01:10:44.014 --> 01:10:45.345
I must go.

01:10:52.022 --> 01:10:53.853
Thanks a lot, Bruce!

01:11:02.766 --> 01:11:06.202
- Where are you going?
- Back to claim what's mine!

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:14.070
Leroy?

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:17.943
Ran out on you, huh?

01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:20.916
Don't cover up for that Ping-Pong playing...

01:11:20.984 --> 01:11:23.578
...chow mein for brains, kung fu head!

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:25.246
What are you doing up there?

01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:28.223
You come down here
before you hurt yourself!

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:29.884
Now!

01:11:31.995 --> 01:11:34.691
I don't understand what you see in him!

01:11:37.968 --> 01:11:39.128
Leroy?

01:11:43.273 --> 01:11:45.400
We meet again, Miss Charles.

01:11:51.081 --> 01:11:52.412
Let me go!

01:11:54.751 --> 01:11:56.878
Get your hands off my woman!

01:11:58.589 --> 01:12:01.080
I said get your hands off my woman!

01:12:01.225 --> 01:12:04.023
Let me go, you big baboon!

01:12:08.198 --> 01:12:09.825
All right!

01:12:11.068 --> 01:12:13.229
Little Joe, man! You pay up, bro!

01:12:13.303 --> 01:12:16.067
This is craps, man! You pay me!

01:12:16.139 --> 01:12:19.575
You blind, man?
This book says "Little Joe"!

01:12:19.643 --> 01:12:24.012
- You pay up, blood!
- You can't even read the book, blood!

01:12:26.617 --> 01:12:28.448
Hey, my man.

01:12:29.286 --> 01:12:30.947
What it look like?

01:12:32.422 --> 01:12:34.890
Hey, my man, what it look like?

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:42.028
Hey, my man, what it look like?

01:12:47.671 --> 01:12:49.298
Hey, my man.

01:12:49.506 --> 01:12:51.531
- What it look like?
- What you want?

01:12:51.608 --> 01:12:53.838
I am the soul brother like no other...

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:56.471
...to deliver this pizza with bean sprouts.

01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:58.514
Pizza with bean sprouts?

01:12:58.782 --> 01:13:00.909
Well, yeah, we make anything, dig?

01:13:01.218 --> 01:13:04.779
"Just direct-a-yo feets-a
to Daddy Green's pizza."

01:13:07.024 --> 01:13:10.221
Now if you bloods would show me
where I can find the Master...

01:13:10.394 --> 01:13:13.295
You sure the Master ordered this pizza?

01:13:16.099 --> 01:13:17.589
The man himself.

01:13:17.668 --> 01:13:20.660
You're going to release his beast
if it gets cold out here.

01:13:20.737 --> 01:13:23.831
I don't know what you're up to,
but I'm gonna rip your face off.

01:13:23.907 --> 01:13:26.307
No, wait! It's okay.

01:13:28.011 --> 01:13:30.502
You the same fool
that came dressed as a coolie?

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.515
No, we all just look alike.

01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:35.744
My man. Brother.

01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:40.178
Yo, bro!

01:13:42.726 --> 01:13:46.958
My man, the Master, he split, you know.

01:13:47.331 --> 01:13:49.424
- What?
- He's not here.

01:13:49.499 --> 01:13:51.433
So why don't you chill out with us?

01:13:51.501 --> 01:13:54.436
Smoke a little herb. Sip a little wine.

01:13:54.571 --> 01:13:56.971
No, I had too much already.

01:13:57.941 --> 01:13:59.408
Soul brother!

01:14:00.043 --> 01:14:01.772
- Soul brother!
- All right!

01:14:01.878 --> 01:14:03.709
You know how to shoot craps?

01:14:04.214 --> 01:14:05.909
- Craps?
- Craps!

01:14:06.249 --> 01:14:07.648
Craps!

01:14:09.419 --> 01:14:11.387
Yeah, craps.

01:14:11.555 --> 01:14:13.648
All right!

01:14:13.724 --> 01:14:14.850
Right on!

01:14:15.926 --> 01:14:17.257
Mr. Leroy?

01:14:28.438 --> 01:14:30.030
Are you in here?

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:37.879
Sorry, miss, I didn't mean
to scare you that bad.

01:14:38.882 --> 01:14:40.645
That's all right.

01:14:41.385 --> 01:14:43.853
Is a Mr. Leroy here?

01:14:44.521 --> 01:14:47.422
No, he's not here, but...

01:14:47.924 --> 01:14:50.859
...how about something
in a medium-sized Oriental?

01:14:50.927 --> 01:14:52.451
No, thanks.

01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:54.854
I'm not Jewish.

01:15:01.371 --> 01:15:04.067
Is this where he does all that stuff?

01:15:04.141 --> 01:15:06.006
Yeah, I do it, too.

01:15:12.282 --> 01:15:14.375
That's really wonderful!

01:15:15.252 --> 01:15:16.310
Yep!

01:15:18.088 --> 01:15:21.023
Well, you see, I'm on my way back to...

01:15:21.091 --> 01:15:22.217
...Kew Gardens.

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:35.303
You gotta tell Mr. Leroy that...

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.341
...he better stay away
from Seventh Heaven.

01:15:40.277 --> 01:15:41.335
Why?

01:15:44.414 --> 01:15:48.111
Because of my "former" producer,
associate...

01:15:50.353 --> 01:15:53.083
...and boyfriend, Eddie Arkadian.

01:15:56.193 --> 01:15:57.785
He's gone crazy.

01:15:58.395 --> 01:15:59.096
Tonight's show is conceived...

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:00.063
Tonight's show is conceived...

01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:03.463
...written, produced, directed and starring...

01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:05.667
...Eddie Arkadian!

01:16:06.269 --> 01:16:09.363
Tonight, we make show biz history...

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.264
...my way!

01:16:17.414 --> 01:16:19.678
I'm getting funky to the smooth...

01:16:19.749 --> 01:16:22.377
...cool sounds of Fast Eddie A!

01:16:25.255 --> 01:16:27.689
"I want you, I need you

01:16:28.158 --> 01:16:31.093
"I love you
Lovin' you every night

01:16:31.428 --> 01:16:34.124
"I crumble at your touch and"

01:16:34.297 --> 01:16:35.696
What's that?

01:16:36.366 --> 01:16:37.560
Fire.

01:16:37.901 --> 01:16:42.270
"You've got me burning hot with desire

01:16:44.307 --> 01:16:49.210
"I feel my temperature
rising higher

01:16:49.379 --> 01:16:52.780
"And, baby, fire
Keep the flame

01:16:53.183 --> 01:16:54.582
"Burning love"

01:16:55.552 --> 01:16:56.917
Who is she?

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:58.580
Charlene.

01:16:58.722 --> 01:17:01.122
"How sublime

01:17:01.224 --> 01:17:04.193
"I feel the passion in my soul"

01:17:04.261 --> 01:17:05.558
She got a manager?

01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:08.297
I don't know.

01:17:08.832 --> 01:17:10.026
Fire!

01:17:12.502 --> 01:17:16.233
This is sure one strange game of craps,
soul brother!

01:17:16.673 --> 01:17:17.697
Yeah!

01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:20.601
This is how we play in Harlem.

01:17:20.677 --> 01:17:23.077
You want to play
like soul brother number one?

01:17:23.146 --> 01:17:25.706
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Right!

01:17:26.283 --> 01:17:29.218
- You play like this.
- All right, I'm sorry.

01:17:29.886 --> 01:17:31.547
Now, it is your turn.

01:17:31.621 --> 01:17:33.646
- Do not step on the line.
- Right!

01:17:33.723 --> 01:17:34.917
My man.

01:17:36.826 --> 01:17:38.521
Right on!

01:17:40.397 --> 01:17:43.628
Two, three, five.

01:17:45.969 --> 01:17:47.095
Turkey!

01:17:47.537 --> 01:17:48.765
Shit!

01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:49.998
You turkey!

01:17:50.073 --> 01:17:52.906
- I collect this whole pot, baby!
- What time is it?

01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:56.210
- Where is the Master?
- Master?

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.542
Looks like my man forgot about his pizza.

01:18:00.917 --> 01:18:03.112
- I must see him now.
- No, no!

01:18:03.186 --> 01:18:05.654
The wise one never sees nobody.

01:18:06.923 --> 01:18:08.618
He will see me.

01:18:08.692 --> 01:18:10.751
- I have this.
- What you got?

01:18:11.394 --> 01:18:13.157
Check this out!

01:18:14.798 --> 01:18:17.562
- It's nice, huh?
- Yeah, I like that.

01:18:22.639 --> 01:18:24.368
Okay, here, come with me.

01:18:24.741 --> 01:18:26.208
I will see him now?

01:18:26.276 --> 01:18:27.766
Yeah, come on.

01:18:33.516 --> 01:18:35.040
Just wait here.

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.297
Where is the Master?

01:18:53.203 --> 01:18:54.568
I want to see him now!

01:18:54.638 --> 01:18:57.266
Please! There is no master!

01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:59.137
- You lie!
- No, it's true!

01:18:59.209 --> 01:19:01.404
We made him up
to sell more fortune cookies!

01:19:01.478 --> 01:19:02.877
- Tell him!
- It's true!

01:19:02.946 --> 01:19:04.038
- Please!
- Show him!

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:05.376
I'll show you!

01:19:06.249 --> 01:19:09.013
- Over here! I'll show you!
- Yeah, show him!

01:19:09.085 --> 01:19:10.552
Show him!

01:19:14.924 --> 01:19:17.324
This is Sum Dum Goy.

01:19:39.683 --> 01:19:40.741
Why?

01:19:40.917 --> 01:19:42.316
Why, Master?

01:19:43.119 --> 01:19:46.850
Why have you sent me on a journey
to find someone who does not exist?

01:19:46.923 --> 01:19:47.981
Why?

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:51.920
So, you have not found
the master that you seek.

01:19:52.595 --> 01:19:54.460
There is no Sum Dum Goy.

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:57.960
He is a computer.

01:19:59.502 --> 01:20:01.697
Why have you done this to me?

01:20:14.417 --> 01:20:15.509
Here.

01:20:15.985 --> 01:20:18.476
It contains everything you need...

01:20:18.555 --> 01:20:20.819
...to find your way to the golden glow.

01:20:30.834 --> 01:20:32.301
Think, Leroy!

01:20:32.435 --> 01:20:35.666
You have just opened a fortune cookie
without a fortune...

01:20:35.772 --> 01:20:38.434
...written by a master who does not exist...

01:20:38.508 --> 01:20:40.533
...to find the solution to a problem...

01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:43.101
...whose answer you already know.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:44.938
And this?

01:20:48.718 --> 01:20:50.447
You needed a charm.

01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:54.056
A true master would use this
to hold up his pants.

01:21:00.563 --> 01:21:01.757
Enough.

01:21:02.632 --> 01:21:04.657
There is one place...

01:21:04.734 --> 01:21:06.463
...that you have not yet looked.

01:21:06.536 --> 01:21:09.403
It is there, only there...

01:21:09.472 --> 01:21:11.997
...that you shall find the master.

01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:17.344
Now, if you will excuse me,
my plane leaves shortly.

01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:22.846
You are going on a quest for knowledge?

01:21:23.686 --> 01:21:26.519
No, I'm going to visit my mother in Miami.

01:21:30.727 --> 01:21:32.558
Leroy!

01:21:32.796 --> 01:21:35.264
Are you actually gonna fight them?

01:21:35.331 --> 01:21:37.993
Well, you can't be serious!

01:21:38.835 --> 01:21:43.272
Leroy, I never would've told you
if I thought you'd actually go there!

01:21:44.841 --> 01:21:46.365
What are you, nuts?

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:50.473
You're not going all alone, are you?

01:21:50.647 --> 01:21:51.875
Are you?

01:21:52.715 --> 01:21:55.445
All right then. Then I'm going with you.

01:21:55.552 --> 01:21:57.645
If you go, I go!

01:21:57.921 --> 01:21:59.013
Okay.

01:22:01.391 --> 01:22:02.483
Okay?

01:22:03.726 --> 01:22:06.092
Do you plan to fight
with only your bare hands?

01:22:06.162 --> 01:22:07.925
Do you not need a weapon?

01:22:08.031 --> 01:22:09.328
Weapon, right!

01:22:14.003 --> 01:22:16.631
What are you doing?
This isn't funny, Leroy!

01:22:16.706 --> 01:22:18.435
Johnny, I am sorry.

01:22:19.175 --> 01:22:20.767
I must do this alone.

01:22:21.277 --> 01:22:24.246
Leroy, come back here!

01:22:26.816 --> 01:22:30.115
Leroy! I'm afraid of the dark!

01:22:50.573 --> 01:22:51.801
Leroy!

01:22:52.308 --> 01:22:53.605
Gag her!

01:22:53.676 --> 01:22:55.075
Right, boss.

01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:08.782
Come on!

01:23:08.858 --> 01:23:10.348
The key. Wait.

01:23:12.195 --> 01:23:14.459
Put the key in the latch and turn it!

01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:17.560
- Okay, I'm trying!
- Well, try harder!

01:23:17.634 --> 01:23:18.726
Okay!

01:23:19.002 --> 01:23:21.095
Okay, you can come out now!

01:23:23.106 --> 01:23:24.437
Come on, let's go!

01:23:24.507 --> 01:23:27.670
Where are we going?
We already missed the second show.

01:23:27.744 --> 01:23:30.144
- Would you just come on?
- Okay!

01:24:10.053 --> 01:24:11.452
Welcome...

01:24:11.521 --> 01:24:15.480
...to my little party in your honor, Leroy.

01:24:21.464 --> 01:24:23.864
The guest list has been compiled...

01:24:23.933 --> 01:24:25.992
...so that you go out in style.

01:24:32.108 --> 01:24:36.272
You don't mind if my friends
introduce themselves, do you, Leroy?

01:24:38.147 --> 01:24:40.047
Then let the games...

01:24:41.084 --> 01:24:43.018
...begin!

01:24:56.666 --> 01:24:58.691
Bravo, Leroy! Olé!

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:01.596
I'm gonna whack this guy out
and get it over with now!

01:25:01.671 --> 01:25:03.571
Give me that thing!

01:25:03.806 --> 01:25:06.673
For God's sake, take that off!
I said take it off!

01:25:06.743 --> 01:25:08.108
You've got to ruin everything!

01:25:08.177 --> 01:25:10.270
The time, money, the energy I've spent!

01:25:10.346 --> 01:25:13.179
Get it off! Get the broad!

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:15.479
Attaboy, Leroy!

01:25:15.985 --> 01:25:18.419
You're a bunch of wussies, you know that?

01:25:19.088 --> 01:25:20.282
More volume!

01:25:26.863 --> 01:25:28.262
All right!

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.761
Way to go, Goliath!

01:25:40.009 --> 01:25:43.342
Go, Geronimo! Give him a lick!

01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:17.012
Go, Johnny!

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:27.316
Come on! Will you make it interesting?

01:26:28.658 --> 01:26:30.455
Good! That's one for you!

01:26:32.528 --> 01:26:35.122
Johnny! Are you all right?

01:26:35.331 --> 01:26:37.424
Shit!

01:26:49.412 --> 01:26:52.176
Come on, you old Crunch!

01:26:55.685 --> 01:26:56.879
Johnny!

01:26:57.053 --> 01:26:59.521
Come on, you miserable slob!

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:01.284
God, what a slug!

01:27:33.489 --> 01:27:35.423
You got it, Johnny!

01:27:51.507 --> 01:27:54.271
Move out. Come on, Plan B.
Let's go! Move out!

01:27:55.478 --> 01:27:57.469
Let's get the hell out of here!

01:27:58.347 --> 01:28:00.907
- Come on, will you?
- Okay, move!

01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:04.047
Come on.

01:28:14.530 --> 01:28:15.792
This way!

01:29:09.652 --> 01:29:11.017
Hey, Leroy!

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.489
That was almost worth
the price of admission in there!

01:29:14.557 --> 01:29:17.958
And to think,
the featured act is yet to come!

01:29:19.295 --> 01:29:21.422
Come on, Leroy!

01:29:35.478 --> 01:29:38.311
Mojo, you go that way! Just go!

01:29:39.482 --> 01:29:40.506
Come on!

01:30:12.915 --> 01:30:14.280
Holy shit!

01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:18.411
Let her go, or next time I will not miss.

01:30:23.426 --> 01:30:25.360
Next time, I won't miss either!

01:30:32.635 --> 01:30:34.535
Got you now, you little punk!

01:30:43.479 --> 01:30:45.344
You'll never use that again!

01:30:59.261 --> 01:31:00.353
Let me go!

01:31:02.098 --> 01:31:03.565
Let him go!

01:31:03.733 --> 01:31:05.598
Anything you say!

01:31:36.766 --> 01:31:37.994
Let me at him!

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:41.365
- Let me at him! I'll save you, Laura!
- Are you all right?

01:31:43.639 --> 01:31:45.607
Of course I'm all right.

01:31:49.178 --> 01:31:50.577
I've got to save Laura.

01:31:50.646 --> 01:31:52.739
You are not going anywhere.

01:31:54.316 --> 01:31:55.977
- Leroy, I wanna help!
- No!

01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:58.680
- I've got to save Laura!
- You will be safe here.

01:31:59.488 --> 01:32:02.423
Leroy, I've got to save Laura!

01:32:02.525 --> 01:32:05.585
I was doing all right
'til the guy got to drop on me!

01:32:07.530 --> 01:32:09.794
Leroy! Come on, man!

01:32:12.134 --> 01:32:14.364
You warmed up yet?

01:32:19.141 --> 01:32:20.108
Yeah!

01:32:20.676 --> 01:32:22.940
Come on, Leroy, let me out!

01:32:25.081 --> 01:32:26.309
Be careful.

01:32:28.284 --> 01:32:32.084
There's nothing like this on stage,
screen, radio, TV, or cable, baby!

01:32:32.588 --> 01:32:34.385
This is an exclusive!

01:32:56.045 --> 01:32:58.639
Get him! Come on, hit him.

01:33:01.617 --> 01:33:03.312
There, nigger, please!

01:33:09.158 --> 01:33:11.456
Duck, Leroy!
You can't do that to my brother!

01:33:11.527 --> 01:33:13.290
Get him, Leroy!

01:33:16.098 --> 01:33:18.692
That's the way! Get him, Leroy!

01:33:27.409 --> 01:33:29.877
All right, come on.

01:33:40.890 --> 01:33:43.017
Stings a little, don't it?

01:33:59.141 --> 01:34:00.802
Come on, Leroy.

01:34:01.377 --> 01:34:03.402
You can run, but you can't hide.

01:35:06.609 --> 01:35:08.577
Playtime's over, boy.

01:35:23.759 --> 01:35:27.160
Ain't this beautiful? I love it!

01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:28.890
This is theater!

01:35:45.447 --> 01:35:46.505
Now...

01:35:46.949 --> 01:35:48.883
...when I say:

01:35:49.018 --> 01:35:51.350
Who's the master?

01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.081
You say:

01:35:53.722 --> 01:35:55.815
Sho'nuff.

01:35:58.794 --> 01:36:00.785
Who's the master?

01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:17.577
We need a better view.
Come on, ringside seats!

01:36:29.925 --> 01:36:33.417
Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:36:36.432 --> 01:36:38.400
Who is the master?

01:36:44.606 --> 01:36:47.006
Wait a minute, sweetheart!

01:36:51.413 --> 01:36:53.347
I love you. Just stay here.

01:36:53.582 --> 01:36:55.880
Who is the master?

01:36:56.552 --> 01:36:58.417
I can't hear you, Leroy!

01:36:58.487 --> 01:37:01.320
Drown him, for Christ's sake!
Will you drown him?

01:37:04.326 --> 01:37:06.658
Who is the master?

01:37:10.399 --> 01:37:12.697
I said, who's the master?

01:37:14.837 --> 01:37:16.464
I can't hear you!

01:37:16.538 --> 01:37:19.098
Who is the master?

01:37:22.578 --> 01:37:25.843
There is one place
that you have not yet looked.

01:37:26.148 --> 01:37:29.117
It is there, only there...

01:37:29.685 --> 01:37:32.176
...that you shall find the master.

01:37:32.388 --> 01:37:34.822
You sure look like a master to me.

01:37:39.862 --> 01:37:43.559
All right, Leroy,
who's the one and only master?

01:37:43.899 --> 01:37:44.957
I am.

01:37:48.504 --> 01:37:50.301
I am!

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.402
What the...

01:37:53.375 --> 01:37:54.842
Shit!

01:37:55.978 --> 01:37:57.639
Goddamn!

01:37:58.213 --> 01:38:00.647
Let me go, motherfucker! Let me go!

01:38:12.127 --> 01:38:13.560
Holy shit!

01:38:23.238 --> 01:38:24.899
Okay, come on!

01:39:26.535 --> 01:39:28.230
I applaud you, Leroy!

01:39:28.303 --> 01:39:30.032
That's a great finish.

01:39:30.172 --> 01:39:33.107
Not the ending I had in mind,
but it's a great finish.

01:39:33.175 --> 01:39:37.077
You see, a.45 will put an end
to all this kung fu crap.

01:39:37.246 --> 01:39:39.680
All it takes is one little bullet.

01:39:40.048 --> 01:39:42.642
So, take your final bows, scum sucker!

01:39:48.490 --> 01:39:51.084
- Leroy!
- No, no!

01:40:22.991 --> 01:40:26.324
Go, Leroy!

01:40:26.528 --> 01:40:29.463
Drown him, Leroy! Get him!

01:40:29.665 --> 01:40:31.223
Drown that sucker!

01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:33.598
What? Oh, God, no!

01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:35.534
- All right!
- No, wait! Jesus!

01:40:35.604 --> 01:40:36.468
No, listen!

01:40:36.538 --> 01:40:38.335
I've never seen anything like that!

01:40:38.407 --> 01:40:39.840
I mean anything! No, wait!

01:40:39.908 --> 01:40:41.705
I'll tell you what, let's make a deal!

01:40:41.777 --> 01:40:44.143
We could make money!
You get foreign rights...

01:40:44.212 --> 01:40:46.612
...l'll take domestic!
What do you say? Wait!

01:40:46.682 --> 01:40:49.014
You can have both, foreign and domestic!

01:40:49.084 --> 01:40:50.813
Just give me a finder's fee!

01:40:50.886 --> 01:40:52.911
Okay, all right, no finder's fee.

01:40:52.988 --> 01:40:54.888
You can have the whole thing!

01:40:54.957 --> 01:40:57.653
Let me pass!
We've got a television show to do!

01:40:58.260 --> 01:40:59.090
Excuse me.

01:40:59.161 --> 01:41:03.723
Laura, where have you been? We've been
looking all over for you. You're late.

01:41:03.799 --> 01:41:05.562
How can I have her ready on time?

01:41:05.634 --> 01:41:07.534
Look at you. You're a mess!

01:41:07.603 --> 01:41:09.833
I didn't bring the right tools with me.

01:41:10.572 --> 01:41:12.437
Richie! Where'd he go?

01:41:12.507 --> 01:41:14.338
Where have you guys been?

01:41:14.443 --> 01:41:16.843
Listen, Officer, I'd like to report a mugging.

01:41:16.912 --> 01:41:20.177
My friend and I, Mr. Nuff,
we were just minding our own business...

01:41:20.248 --> 01:41:22.648
...when we were assaulted
by these hoodlums!

01:41:22.718 --> 01:41:24.413
We're lucky to be alive!

01:41:24.486 --> 01:41:27.512
Save it, Arkadian!
You're going up for good this time!

01:41:28.423 --> 01:41:30.983
- Never!
- Come on, Laura, you're due in the studio.

01:41:31.059 --> 01:41:32.151
Let's go.

01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:26.304
Ready for commercial.

01:42:31.153 --> 01:42:33.451
Would you teach me some moves?

01:42:40.696 --> 01:42:42.994
Man, check out the cornball!

01:42:43.065 --> 01:42:44.692
He ain't no cornball!

01:42:44.766 --> 01:42:47.758
He's my brother and he's the Master!
