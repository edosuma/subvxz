WEBVTT

00:04.405 --> 00:05.206
GOOD WORK, DAD.

00:05.239 --> 00:08.109
COME ON, HENRY.
LIGHTEN UP, ALL RIGHT?

00:08.142 --> 00:08.876
HOW CAN I?

00:08.909 --> 00:10.344
SANTA CLAUS ISN'T
COMING TONIGHT!

00:10.378 --> 00:12.746
SO WHAT?
WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE
A GREAT CHRISTMAS.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.215
I MEAN, PRESENTS,
STOCKINGS,

00:14.248 --> 00:15.383
THE WHOLE 9 YARDS.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.784
PRESENTS

00:16.817 --> 00:20.020
THAT'S WHAT SANTA DOES!

00:20.321 --> 00:23.157
HEY, HENRY!
OH, BETTER NOT POUT.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.659
OH, I'M WAY PAST POUTING.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.662
WHAT HAPPENED?
I WAS JUST
ON MY WAY DOWN

00:28.696 --> 00:30.298
TO SEE YOU
PLAY JOSEPH
AT THE MANGER.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.599
WELL, YOU MISSED
A HECK OF A SHOW.

00:31.632 --> 00:36.137
[O LITTLE TOWN
OF BETHLEHEM PLAYING]

00:40.508 --> 00:41.575
OH, STOP IT!

00:41.609 --> 00:42.843
OW! OW!

00:42.876 --> 00:44.412
YOU WERE AMBUSHED
BY ELVES?

00:44.445 --> 00:47.215
YEAH, YEAH.
SANTA'S ELVES.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.284
THE FAT BASTARD
SICKED 'EM ON ME.

00:50.884 --> 00:51.852
BUT YOUR DAD IS SANTA.

00:51.885 --> 00:57.125
YEAH, AND HE'S A FAT BASTARD,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:57.158 --> 01:00.294
CHRISTMAS IS GONNA BE
SO MUCH BETTER THIS YEAR
WITHOUT HIM.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.762
HE'S NOT COMING?!

01:01.795 --> 01:03.497
UH-UH, NOPE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M FINE WITH IT.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.799
BECAUSE EVERY YEAR,
HE MANAGES TO STEAMROLL

01:05.833 --> 01:07.135
RIGHT OVER MY CHRISTMAS.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.102
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NO, WALT HAS TO COME,

01:08.136 --> 01:10.738
'CAUSE EVERY YEAR,
HENRY SNEAKS
OUT OF HIS BED

01:10.771 --> 01:12.706
TO GET
THAT LITTLE PEAK
AT SANTA CLAUS.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.375
HEY, LOOK,
HENRY'S GONNA HAVE
A GOOD CHRISTMAS.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.276
OK, TRUST ME.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.810
HEY, SWEETIE, YOU WANT
A CHRISTMAS COOKIE?

01:16.844 --> 01:19.313
I MADE YOU THIS SNOWMAN.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.483
THAT'S THE SPIRIT,
BUDDY.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.090
THERE IT GOES.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.806
HENRY'S STILL PRETTY UPSET.

01:45.839 --> 01:46.907
OH, HE'S GONNA
GET OVER IT.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.243
COULDN'T YOU JUST RUIN CHRISTMAS
THE OLD

01:49.277 --> 01:52.613
JUST GET DRUNK AND
FALL DOWN THE FIREPLACE?

01:53.481 --> 01:55.483
NIGHT'S STILL YOUNG.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.618
Claudia:
AH, FINALLY.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.454
WHOA! HEY, MAN, YOU GOT
THAT TREE FOR FREE?

02:00.488 --> 02:01.255
DIDN'T I SAY I WOULD?

02:01.289 --> 02:02.856
YEAH, YOU SAID
YOU WOULD 2 WEEKS AGO.

02:02.890 --> 02:03.724
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.793
WELL, I GOT IT HERE
WITH A DAY TO SPARE.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.762
JUST GET IT IN THE STAND.
I'LL GO GET THE DECORATIONS.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.398
HEE HEE HEE!
YES! YES!

02:10.431 --> 02:12.700
DEAN LEFT THIS GIFT FOR ME
ON THE FRONT PORCH.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.468
HE IS SO SWEET!
LOOK!

02:14.502 --> 02:15.769
HE EVEN WRAPPED IT
HIMSELF.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.206
HOW SWEET IS THAT?!

02:18.606 --> 02:20.774
IT SAYS "LOVE."

02:21.809 --> 02:23.777
LOVE!

02:23.811 --> 02:25.746
WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE
LOOKING AT?

02:25.779 --> 02:27.881
THIS IS PERSONAL.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.751
WHAT'S WITH THE GETUP?

02:30.784 --> 02:34.555
I WAS PLAYING JOSEPH
DOWN AT THE LIVING MANGER
AT THE CHURCH.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.690
WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.526
FOR THE KIDS, MAN.
FOR THE KIDS.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.628
YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR,
I COULDN'T PRY 'EM
AWAY FROM IT.

02:40.661 --> 02:45.799
[O COME,
ALL YE FAITHFUL PLAYING]

02:51.472 --> 02:55.409
DAD, WE WEREN'T
LOOKING AT JOSEPH.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.678
OH, MAN.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.546
WOW.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.715
DOES THAT GOAT KNOW
THAT THAT'S A SHEEP?

03:01.749 --> 03:03.984
IT DOESN'T CARE.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.486
GROSS.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.288
OK, YOU KIDS READY
TO GO HOME?

03:07.321 --> 03:08.456
IN A MINUTE.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.691
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WISH SOMEONE
WOULD'VE TOLD ME THAT

03:10.724 --> 03:11.892
WHEN I SIGNED UP
FOR THE GIG.

03:11.925 --> 03:15.796
SHEEP AND A GOAT--
THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.765
THEY COULD SPAWN
A HYBRID CREATURE

03:17.798 --> 03:21.502
WITH STRENGTH OF A GOAT
AND THE CUNNING OF A SHEEP.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.471
HENRY! WE'RE GONNA
TRIM THE TREE!

03:23.504 --> 03:25.673
Henry:
TRIM IT YOURSELF!

03:26.374 --> 03:28.376
THAT ISN'T NICE.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.777
MOM, WHAT'S WITH HIM?

03:29.810 --> 03:30.844
OH, WELL,
THANKS TO YOUR DAD,

03:30.878 --> 03:31.812
SANTA'S NOT COMING
TONIGHT.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.747
DID YOU TICK
THE OLD MAN OFF?

03:33.781 --> 03:36.417
NO, NO, NO.
DAD TICKED ME OFF.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.785
HO HO HO!

03:37.818 --> 03:40.788
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
SANTA TO BRING YOU
THIS YEAR?

03:40.821 --> 03:43.591
AN ASTRO JAMMER
BATTLE BUGGY.

03:43.624 --> 03:47.027
WELL, SINCE YOU'VE BEEN
SUCH A GOOD BOY,

03:47.060 --> 03:51.365
SANTA'S GONNA PUT
THAT ON HIS SLEIGH
JUST FOR YOU.

03:51.399 --> 03:51.999
REALLY?!

03:52.032 --> 03:54.468
YES, OF COURSE.
HA HA HA!

03:54.502 --> 03:57.571
WE SPENT 3 MONTHS
TRYING TO TALK HIM
OUT OF THAT THING.

03:57.605 --> 04:01.575
* DEEP-TREAD TIRES
FOR ALL-WHEEL TRACTION *

04:01.609 --> 04:05.579
* RUBBER-TIPPED
MISSILES FOR SAFE
KILLING ACTION *

04:05.613 --> 04:06.314
TV: * REAL JAMMING

04:06.347 --> 04:10.418
* ASTRO JAMMER
BATTLE BUGGY *

04:10.451 --> 04:12.520
I WANT THAT!

04:12.553 --> 04:13.454
NO.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.356
BUT IT COMES
WITH EVERYTHING
YOU SEE HERE!

04:15.389 --> 04:19.560
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE,
AND THERE'S NO USE
FOR IT.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.762
I CAN PICK UP
GROCERIES IN IT,

04:21.795 --> 04:22.863
AND SEE IN THAT PICTURE?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.665
THE CAT'S RUNNING
AWAY FROM IT.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.400
NO MORE WORRYING
ABOUT CATS.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.935
HONEY, THAT TOY IS
DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE

04:27.968 --> 04:29.870
WITH A LOT
OF OPEN LAND.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.340
NO, IT'S NOT!
IT'S ALL-TERRAIN!

04:32.373 --> 04:33.841
IT EVEN GOES UP CURBS!

04:33.874 --> 04:36.744
HENRY,
FIGHTING MACHINES
ARE GIRLS' TOYS.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.478
THEY ARE?

04:37.511 --> 04:40.781
YEAH...YEAH.
YOU SEE THAT MIRROR?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.783
THAT'S FOR CHECKING
YOUR MAKEUP.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.586
OH.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.687
ALL THAT WORK
FOR NOTHING.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.522
OH, NO, NO, NO.
IT WASN'T FOR NOTHING.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.758
BECAUSE WALT GETS
TO COME OFF GREAT, OK?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.092
HE GETS TO BE
THE BIG GENEROUS HERO,

04:52.125 --> 04:55.663
AND I'M JUST THE DAD
THAT DISAPPOINTS HIS KID
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.098
YOU KNOW,
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT
CHRISTMASES WERE LIKE

04:58.131 --> 04:59.767
WHEN WE WERE KIDS?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.635
DAD?

05:01.669 --> 05:03.904
CAN I GET
AN EVEL KNIEVEL
STUNT CYCLE

05:03.937 --> 05:05.339
FOR CHRISTMAS?
NO.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.808
BUT EVERY KID'S
GONNA HAVE ONE.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.478
NOT YOU.

05:10.944 --> 05:11.945
THEY ONLY COST $15.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.681
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
EVEL KNIEVEL.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.784
YOU'RE GETTING PANTS
AND A YO-YO,

05:16.817 --> 05:20.388
AND YOU'D BETTER ACT
SURPRISED.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.689
I REMEMBER THAT CHRISTMAS.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.791
I GOT A DICTIONARY
AND A VEST.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.093
YEAH, AT LEAST
YOU DIDN'T GET
BEANED WITH A YO-YO

05:26.126 --> 05:27.895
FOR NOT ACTING
SURPRISED.

05:27.928 --> 05:31.932
GOOD LORD, YOU GUYS
GREW UP IN A DICKENS NOVEL.

05:31.965 --> 05:32.900
IT WAS MORE LIKE BUKOWSKI.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.469
HEY, YOU KNOW,
I HAD EVERY REASON
TO BE UPSET.

05:35.503 --> 05:38.506
DOES YOUR DAD KNOW
HOW MUCH THOSE
BUGGY THINGS COST?

05:38.539 --> 05:39.507
I TOLD HIM.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.842
350 BUCKS!
THAT'S INSANE!

05:41.875 --> 05:42.643
YEAH, DAD.
YEAH, IT IS, OK?

05:42.676 --> 05:43.644
SO YOU GOTTA GET HIM
BACK ON YOUR LAP

05:43.677 --> 05:45.513
AND TELL HIM
HE'S NOT GETTING
THE BATTLE BUGGY.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.880
ALL RIGHT?
TELL HIM THAT YOU, UH,

05:46.914 --> 05:47.615
YOU RAN OUT OF 'EM.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.517
SANTA DOESN'T
RUN OUT OF THINGS.

05:49.550 --> 05:53.387
LOOK, WHATEVER.
TELL HIM THAT THE ELVES
WENT ON STRIKE.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.822
THE ELVES
AREN'T UNIONIZED.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.590
LOOK, IT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
ALL RIGHT?

05:56.624 --> 05:57.391
YOU TOLD HIM
HE'S GETTING IT,

05:57.425 --> 05:59.760
AND NOW YOU GOTTA
TELL HIM HE'S NOT.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.029
HO HO HO!

06:02.062 --> 06:03.464
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.164
YOU HAVE TO.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.499
SANTA'S JOB ISN'T
TO TELL KIDS

06:05.533 --> 06:06.767
THEY CAN'T
HAVE THINGS.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.901
SANTA'S A YES-MAN.

06:07.935 --> 06:08.736
OH, GREAT,
NOW YOU'RE A YES-MAN.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.037
REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID
AND I WANTED

06:10.070 --> 06:11.705
THE EVEL KNIEVEL
STUNT CYCLE?

06:11.739 --> 06:13.106
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?!

06:13.140 --> 06:16.176
OH, GOD! OF COURSE
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER!

06:16.209 --> 06:17.010
GET OUT OF HERE!

06:17.044 --> 06:18.812
HEY, I'M GOING.
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.914
I'M GOING.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.551
OH! OH, MAN,
I'M SORRY!

06:23.584 --> 06:25.686
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE CARDBOARD!

06:25.719 --> 06:27.888
OH...OH.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.458
YOU BROUGHT VIOLENCE
TO CHRISTMAS TOWN?

06:30.491 --> 06:32.926
IT WAS SANTA LAND,

06:32.960 --> 06:33.727
AND YES.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.864
LOOK AT WHAT
DEAN GOT ME.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.467
OH, GREAT. THE BOYFRIEND
GOT YOU UNDERWEAR.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.469
IT'S INCREDIBLY
ROMANTIC,

06:41.502 --> 06:43.170
AND TO PROVE IT,
HE EVEN WROTE
"LOVE."

06:43.203 --> 06:44.972
SEE, "LOVE, DEAN."

06:45.005 --> 06:46.740
THAT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE DEAN.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.976
NO, IT JUST GOT
A LITTLE SMUDGED
OUTSIDE.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.912
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A "D."

06:51.945 --> 06:53.581
NO, IT'S AN "H."

06:53.614 --> 06:54.748
NO, IT'S NOT.

06:54.782 --> 06:55.549
LOOKS MORE LIKE A "B."

06:55.583 --> 06:58.619
NO, IT SAYS "D."
IT'S FROM DEAN, OK?

06:58.652 --> 07:03.591
IF IT WERE "B" IT--
OH, GOD.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.992
BRAD.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.927
OK, COULD
THAT SAY "BRAD"?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.762
I DON'T KNOW. IT MIGHT.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.163
OOH, IT WOULD
BE JUST LIKE
THAT DUMB BUTT

07:10.197 --> 07:15.068
TO GET ME SOMETHING
SO DORKY AND GROSS!

07:15.102 --> 07:17.705
OK, I'VE STUDIED IT.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.972
ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S WHAT YOU GOT.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.875
IT COULD EITHER BE
FROM BRAD OR DEAN.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.678
OR A GUY CALLED "BEAD."

07:24.712 --> 07:29.617
OR "DREN"
OR POSSIBLY "BLEG."

07:29.650 --> 07:33.053
GREAT. SO HOW
AM I SUPPOSED
TO FIND OUT?

07:33.086 --> 07:34.087
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST ASK HIM?

07:34.121 --> 07:36.023
WELL, IF I ASK DEAN
AND HE DIDN'T
GIVE IT TO ME,

07:36.056 --> 07:37.090
HE'S GONNA THINK
THAT I'M HINTING

07:37.124 --> 07:38.125
THAT HE SHOULD'VE,
AND I'M NOT.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.127
AND IF I ASK BRAD
AND HE DIDN'T
GIVE 'EM TO ME,

07:40.160 --> 07:41.629
HE'S GONNA THINK
I WISH HE HAD,

07:41.662 --> 07:44.932
AND I DON'T!
I HATE CHRISTMAS!

07:46.099 --> 07:49.503
ALL RIGHT, THE TREE'S READY.
THROW ALL YOUR CRAP ON IT.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.972
GOD,
IT'S ALMOST 8:00,

07:52.005 --> 07:54.107
AND WE HAVEN'T
EVEN DECORATED
THE TREE.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.744
QUALITY TAKES TIME.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.012
YEAH, THAT,
AND WE DIDN'T START LOOKING

07:59.046 --> 08:01.148
TILL AFTER 5:00.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.288
HOW MUCH LONGER
DO WE HAVE TO SIT HERE?

08:08.321 --> 08:11.291
NOT MUCH LONGER.
AT 5:00, THIS PLACE
CLOSES,

08:11.324 --> 08:15.062
AND THAT LAST TREE
GETS THROWN
IN THE DUMPSTER.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.130
IT'S MEANT FOR US.

08:19.099 --> 08:19.967
NO, YOU DON'T.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.869
NO, YOU DON'T!

08:21.902 --> 08:24.104
I'M SORRY, FOLKS.
TOO LATE.
WE'RE CLOSED.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.707
CAN WE JUST BUY
THAT LAST TREE?

08:26.740 --> 08:28.075
ON CHRISTMAS EVE?

08:28.108 --> 08:30.744
SORRY, FOLKS.
YOU CAN'T WAIT UNTIL NOW

08:30.778 --> 08:31.812
TO GET A TREE,
ALL RIGHT?

08:31.845 --> 08:34.582
THIS ONE'S BEEN PROMISED
TO THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.515
IT HAS?

08:35.549 --> 08:37.050
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'D
BETTER GET OUT OF HERE,

08:37.084 --> 08:39.052
'CAUSE IF HE SEES YOU
EYEBALLING HIS TREE--

08:39.086 --> 08:41.054
I'M JUST SAYING.

08:41.088 --> 08:41.789
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:41.822 --> 08:44.224
IT'S OK, STEVE.
I GOT THIS ONE.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.993
MY NAME IS WARREN,

08:46.026 --> 08:47.260
AND WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU?

08:47.294 --> 08:50.998
WARREN, IT'S 5:00.
YOU'RE CLOSED.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.600
TAKE THE SIGN DOWN.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.768
I CLOSE AT 6:00.

08:54.802 --> 08:58.271
I WANT TO TALK
TO STEVE.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.840
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST BUY IT?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.575
I DON'T BUY TREES.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.676
IT'S PEOPLE TRYING
TO PROFIT

09:02.710 --> 09:04.878
FROM THE BIRTH
OF OUR LORD.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.079
Sean, whispering:
Hey, hey.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.147
Is Henry still in bed?

09:07.180 --> 09:08.115
Claudia: YEAH.
GREAT. WHOO!

09:08.148 --> 09:11.184
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I GIVE YOU SANTA CLAUS!

09:11.218 --> 09:13.887
A KICK-ASS SANTA CLAUS.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.089
WHERE DID YOU
FIND THAT?

09:16.123 --> 09:16.957
IN THE ATTIC.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.594
OH, YEAH,
WE DON'T NEED WALT.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.063
I SHOULD'VE DONE
THIS GIG YEARS AGO.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.231
THERE'S SPIDERS
IN THAT.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.167
AAH! GOD! YUCK!

09:27.200 --> 09:29.803
LOOK, SEAN,
I KNOW HAVE EVERY REASON

09:29.837 --> 09:30.938
TO WANT TO KILL
YOUR DAD.

09:30.971 --> 09:31.905
BUT THIS ISN'T
ABOUT YOU.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.742
THIS IS ABOUT HENRY.
IT'S ABOUT CHRISTMAS EVE.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.310
CAN'T YOU JUST CALL WALT
AND ASK HIM TO COME OVER?

09:37.344 --> 09:38.345
NO, I DON'T WANT HIM
TO COME OVER.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.280
AND EVEN IF I DID,
WHICH I DON'T,

09:40.313 --> 09:42.349
IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.751
WHY NOT?

09:43.784 --> 09:46.620
WELL, JOSEPH,
BACK AT THE MANGER,

09:46.654 --> 09:49.757
WELL, HE TOOK THINGS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.959
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THAT THESE HANDS,

09:51.992 --> 09:54.762
THE HANDS OF A LOWLY,
SIMPLE CARPENTER,

09:54.795 --> 09:59.933
WOULD ONE DAY CRADLE
A CHILD SUCH AS THIS?

09:59.967 --> 10:01.268
UH, DON'T WAVE, JESUS.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.136
HEY, I'M
THE BIG DRAW HERE.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.672
PLEASE,
JUST TAKE IT EASY, PAL.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.274
BEHOLD BY THE LIGHT
OF YON STAR

10:07.307 --> 10:09.910
THAT THESE 3 WISE MEN
HAVE COME

10:09.943 --> 10:12.846
TO LOOK AT THE SON
OF GOD.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.513
OW!

10:13.546 --> 10:15.215
THIS GOAT
IS EATING MY SOCK!

10:15.248 --> 10:17.084
Sean: COME FORWARD,

10:17.117 --> 10:19.119
REJOICE,
GATHER ROUND,

10:19.152 --> 10:22.756
FOR TODAY
OUR SAVIOR IS BORN!

10:26.827 --> 10:28.729
LOOK, I ADMIT
IT WASN'T THE GREATEST
MANGER SCENE EVER,

10:28.762 --> 10:31.799
BUT YOU KNOW,
WE WERE KIND OF GETTING
INTO THE SPIRIT,

10:31.832 --> 10:34.702
AND THE CROWD SEEMED
TO BE EATING IT UP.

10:35.468 --> 10:39.406
BEHOLD THE GIFTS
BESTOWED UPON THIS CHILD

10:39.439 --> 10:42.242
BY THIS TRIUMVIRATE
OF WISE MEN.

10:42.275 --> 10:46.714
BEHOLD!
CAN--CAN THE PEOPLE
IN THE BACK BEHOLD?

10:46.747 --> 10:48.448
CAN THE PEOPLE
IN THE FRONT
PLEASE MAKE ROOM

10:48.481 --> 10:51.985
FOR THOSE IN THE BACK
WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY BEHOLDING?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.120
Walt: HO HO HO!

10:53.153 --> 10:56.156
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

10:56.189 --> 10:57.124
Kids: SANTA! SANTA!

10:57.157 --> 11:00.260
IT'S SANTA!
LET'S GO! YAY!

11:00.293 --> 11:04.297
NO. NO, NO.
BEHOLD JESUS, NOT SANTA.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.432
HIM, NOT HIM!

11:05.465 --> 11:07.334
Walt: HO HO HO!

11:07.367 --> 11:10.771
COME BACK!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

11:12.339 --> 11:15.142
Walt: YOU'RE
GETTING PANTS
AND A YO-YO.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.376
PANTS AND A YO-YO!

11:16.409 --> 11:21.281
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.
SANTA'S A YES-MAN.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.082
HO HO HO!

11:22.115 --> 11:24.785
PANTS AND A YO-YO.
PANTS AND A YO-YO.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.353
PANTS AND A YO-YO!

11:26.386 --> 11:28.956
HO HO HO!
PANTS AND A YO-YO.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.024
PANTS AND A YO-YO.
PANTS AND A YO-YO.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.126
PANTS AND A YO-YO.
PANTS AND A YO-YO.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.363
PANTS AND A YO-YO.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.782
SANTA'S BEEN HIT!
SANTA'S BEEN HIT!

11:56.516 --> 11:59.186
IT WAS JOSEPH.
HE DID IT.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.153
GET HIM!

12:00.187 --> 12:01.755
Brad: I GOT YOUR BACK,
MR. FINNERTY. I GOT YA!

12:01.789 --> 12:04.057
WHAT YOU GOT?
WHAT YOU GOT?

12:10.964 --> 12:14.501
Sean: HEY! OW!

12:18.071 --> 12:19.372
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THE MICROWAVE'S

12:19.406 --> 12:20.073
GONNA KILL SPIDERS?

12:20.107 --> 12:23.176
THAT OR GIVE THEM
SUPERPOWERS.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.544
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO JUST CALL WALT?

12:24.577 --> 12:27.514
NO WAY, BABY.
LOOK, I'VE KICKED BACK
ALL THESE YEARS

12:27.547 --> 12:29.116
WATCHING HIM HAVE FUN,
ALL RIGHT?

12:29.149 --> 12:30.450
IT'S MY TURN
TO BE SANTA.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.052
I'M GONNA CHANGE
THINGS UP,

12:32.085 --> 12:32.920
PUT A LITTLE FUNK ON IT.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.488
YOU'RE GONNA PUT
A LITTLE FUNK ON SANTA?

12:35.522 --> 12:38.225
YEAH! THERE'S
NO REASON SANTA
COULDN'T BE COOL,

12:38.258 --> 12:39.259
YOU KNOW,
APPEAL TO KIDS,

12:39.292 --> 12:42.796
HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR THE LADIES.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.365
MAC DADDY SANTA.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.234
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.936
I JUST HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.904
I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.473
YOU JUST WATCH--

12:53.506 --> 12:57.410
OW! HOT, HOT, OH!

12:57.444 --> 12:58.211
LILY?

12:58.245 --> 13:01.148
BRAD, I'M IN HERE.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.115
WOW!

13:02.149 --> 13:05.452
UH...DO YOU APPROVE?

13:05.485 --> 13:07.988
OF YOU NOT WEARING PANTS?

13:08.021 --> 13:09.923
YES!

13:09.957 --> 13:11.491
NO, OF THE BOXER SHORTS.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.260
I HOPE THEY WEREN'T
TOO EXPENSIVE?

13:13.293 --> 13:17.030
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
MY MOM ONLY BUYS ME
BRIEFS.

13:17.064 --> 13:20.133
SHE SAYS BOYS NEED
SUPPORT, YOU KNOW?

13:20.968 --> 13:24.271
BRAD, AM I WEARING
YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT?

13:24.304 --> 13:27.407
MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:27.440 --> 13:30.243
HOW CAN I TELL
IF YOU'RE WEARING
MY PERFUME?

13:30.277 --> 13:32.112
YOU GOT ME PERFUME?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.513
YEAH.
YES!

13:33.546 --> 13:35.548
I KNEW YOU'D
LIKE IT. I DIDN'T--

13:35.582 --> 13:37.885
WHAT?
THE PERFUME?

13:37.918 --> 13:40.253
OH, YEAH.
THANK YOU.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.990
OK, YOU CAN GO NOW.
THANKS, YEAH.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.591
OH, DO YOU WANT--
THANKS FOR COMING!

13:44.624 --> 13:46.493
OH, GREAT.
I'LL STOP BY--

13:46.526 --> 13:47.460
YES!

13:47.494 --> 13:49.329
IT ACTUALLY LOOKS
KIND OF GOOD.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.131
YOUR CHEEKS
ARE ALL ROSY.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.065
OHH.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.434
HEY, MERRY CHRISTMAS,
MR. AND MRS. FINNERTY.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.602
OH, MERRY CHRISTMAS,
BRAD.

13:55.635 --> 13:56.836
HEY, SORRY I COULDN'T DO MORE
AT THE MANGER TONIGHT, MAN.

13:56.870 --> 14:01.975
I GOTTA TAKE OFF MY SHIRT
TO REALLY KICK SOME ASS,
YOU KNOW?

14:02.009 --> 14:03.076
NO PROBLEM.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.512
YOU KNOW, BRAD,
WE HAVE SOME EGGNOG
IN THE KITCHEN.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.381
OH, GREAT.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.884
THAT--

14:12.485 --> 14:14.254
CAN I HAVE SOME?

14:15.522 --> 14:16.489
YES.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.190
OH.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.358
I'LL GET YOU
A GLASS. COME ON.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.459
OH, YES!

14:19.492 --> 14:23.096
OK, I ADMIT IT,
THIS TREE IS BEAUTIFUL.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.565
WHERE DID YOU
FIND THIS?

14:25.598 --> 14:27.434
AROUND.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.438
YEAH, UNCLE EDDIE
JUST HAPPENED
TO SPOT IT.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.973
LET'S JUST GO HOME.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.208
WE'RE NEVER GONNA
FIND A TREE.

14:35.242 --> 14:39.546
FORTUNE FAVORS
THE BOLD, MY FRIEND.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.523
BINGO.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.093
IT'S A HOSPITAL.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.329
AND THIS IS
AN EMERGENCY.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.209
JIMMY, WHEN I SAY
WATCH MY BACK,

15:09.242 --> 15:10.510
I DON'T MEAN LOOK
AT MY BACK,

15:10.543 --> 15:11.578
I MEAN WATCH MY BACK.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.681
STEALING A CHRISTMAS TREE
FROM A HOSPITAL'S A CRIME.

15:14.714 --> 15:18.218
SO'S DUMPING TEA
IN THE BOSTON HARBOR.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.153
BUT SOMETIMES YOU
GOTTA TAKE A STAND.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.189
BUT WE'RE NOT TAKING
A STAND.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.224
WE'RE TAKING
A CHRISTMAS TREE.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.560
YEAH, WE'RE
STRIKING BACK
AT THE H.M.O.s.

15:31.231 --> 15:36.569
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
OUR CHRISTMAS TREE?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.171
THERE'S
A LIGHT BURNT,

15:38.205 --> 15:39.506
AND I'M TAKING IT
TO MY WORKSHOP,

15:39.539 --> 15:41.241
AND I'M GONNA
BRING IT THERE,

15:41.274 --> 15:43.076
I'M GONNA BRING IT
BACK HERE.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.445
OH, THANK YOU.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.647
YOU'RE WELCOME.
SO YOU SHOULD
GO BACK TO BED

15:47.680 --> 15:48.748
AND HAVE
A GOOD NIGHT.

15:48.781 --> 15:49.649
BUT THIS IS MY FLOOR.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.684
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
HAVE A GOOD
CHRISTMAS.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.987
I DON'T WANT
TO GO UPSTAIRS!

15:54.021 --> 15:56.523
THIS IS MY FLOOR!

15:57.190 --> 15:58.391
YOU STOLE THEIR TREE?!

15:58.425 --> 15:59.492
HEY, I AM NOT A MONSTER.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.628
I LEFT THEM
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.632
Eddie: OK, JIMMY,
PLUG HER IN.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.273
YOU ARE TAKING
THIS THING BACK
RIGHT NOW!

16:13.306 --> 16:14.207
I'LL TAKE IT BACK.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.575
BUT YOU KNOW,
I'D HATE TO SEE
HENRY'S FACE

16:15.608 --> 16:16.676
CHRISTMAS MORNING
WHEN HE WAKES UP

16:16.709 --> 16:18.278
AND HE FINDS
HIS TREE IS GONE.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.681
YOU'RE TAKING THIS THING
BACK TOMORROW.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.516
HO HO HO!
* YOU GOT A SANTA

16:23.550 --> 16:27.220
* YOU GOT
A BITCHIN' SANTA,
FANTASTIC SANTA *

16:27.254 --> 16:28.621
WHOO!

16:28.655 --> 16:30.223
OH, YOU SMELL
LIKE CAT PEE.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.627
WELL,
MERRY CHRISTMAS
TO YOU, TOO.

16:37.097 --> 16:37.864
HEY.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.667
HEY, LOOK AT YOU, HUH?
KRIS KRINGLE.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.801
YEAH.
NICE.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.437
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GETTING ME
FOR CHRISTMAS THERE, CHUBS?

16:44.471 --> 16:45.438
WELL, CALL ME
CHUBS AGAIN,

16:45.472 --> 16:47.807
AND I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT I GOT YOU
FOR CHRISTMAS.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.808
LILY'S UPSTAIRS.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.543
HEY, THAT IS
A NICE-LOOKING TREE.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.679
THANK YOU. IT'S STOLEN.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.647
COOL.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.584
HEY, FINNERTY--WOW.

16:57.617 --> 16:58.385
DEAN, HEY.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.786
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:59.819 --> 17:02.055
UM, YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY PANTS ON.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.591
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.627
NO, NO. SEE,
YOUR PARENTS ARE
RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.697
SO WHAT?
ALL RIGHT.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.600
HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.269
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

17:16.303 --> 17:17.537
WHAT AM
I DOING HERE?

17:17.570 --> 17:19.106
I'M KNOCKING BACK
SOME EGGNOG

17:19.139 --> 17:20.640
WITH THE LADY
IN HER UNDERWEAR.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.575
NO, HE'S NOT.
RELAX, OK?

17:22.609 --> 17:23.510
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
LIKE YOU'RE HERE

17:23.543 --> 17:25.412
WITH ANOTHER MAN
OR ANYTHING.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.246
ALL RIGHT!

17:26.279 --> 17:29.349
THE SHIRT'S
COMING OFF!

17:29.382 --> 17:30.217
LET'S GO!

17:30.250 --> 17:32.519
BRAD! BRAD, GO HOME!

17:32.552 --> 17:33.553
BRAD, GO HOME.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.654
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.290
IT'S CHRISTMAS,
AND WE'LL SAVE THIS
FOR ANOTHER DAY.

17:37.324 --> 17:40.627
BUT IF YOU HAPPEN
TO SMELL SOMETHING
SWEET ON HER,

17:40.660 --> 17:42.095
IT'S THE PERFUME
I GAVE HER!

17:42.129 --> 17:45.064
THE SCENT
OF BRAD O'KEEFE.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.568
GO, GO. UHH.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.571
SO, UH, HE GOT
YOU PERFUME, HUH?

17:51.604 --> 17:54.241
YEAH, BUT WHO CARES?
I HATE PERFUME.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.576
PERFUME IS
FOR OLD LADIES
AND HOOKERS.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.678
I LIKE
WHAT YOU GOT ME.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.447
I, UM...

18:00.480 --> 18:01.748
I GOT YOU PERFUME.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.751
OH. I LIKE--

18:04.784 --> 18:06.753
I LIKE PERFUME,
THOUGH. I MEAN--

18:06.786 --> 18:12.159
I LIKE THIS PERFUME.
OH, YES, OK.

18:12.192 --> 18:12.892
OH!

18:12.925 --> 18:15.328
THIS IS THE PERFUME
I LIKE.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.165
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
FINNERTY.

18:18.198 --> 18:18.998
Henry: HEY!

18:19.031 --> 18:22.369
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
SANTA'S UNDERWEAR?

18:22.402 --> 18:24.671
WHAT?

18:24.704 --> 18:26.439
SANTA'S UNDERWEAR.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.308
I WRAPPED THEM MYSELF,
AND I LEFT THEM

18:28.341 --> 18:29.442
ON THE FRONT PORCH
FOR HIM,

18:29.476 --> 18:31.778
AND YOU'RE WEARING THEM!

18:32.412 --> 18:34.314
WHY IS EVERYBODY
IN THIS FAMILY

18:34.347 --> 18:36.416
TRYING TO DESTROY
MY CHRISTMAS?!

18:36.449 --> 18:42.222
Claudia: HENRY FINNERTY,
GET BACK IN THAT BED!

18:45.858 --> 18:47.694
Claudia: HENRY,
I THINK I HEARD HIM.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.263
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.268
IT'S HIM! HE DID COME!

18:55.302 --> 18:57.370
HO HO HO!

18:57.704 --> 18:59.639
CRAP.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.175
MOM, WHY DID SANTA
JUST USE A SWEAR WORD?

19:02.209 --> 19:05.212
LOOK, HE'S GOING
FOR THE MILK
AND COOKIES.

19:05.245 --> 19:09.682
MILK AND COOKIES.
HO HO HO!

19:09.716 --> 19:12.752
OH, YES, MILK.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.357
OH! SOUR MILK.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.258
OH!

19:18.291 --> 19:20.727
SANTA WONDERS WHEN HENRY
PUT THIS MILK OUT.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.630
YESTERDAY.
SO I WOULDN'T FORGET.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.800
WELL, I'LL JUST SAVE THIS
FOR MY THIRSTY REINDEER.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.203
OK, QUICK,
BACK TO BED, OK,
BEFORE HE SEES YOU.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.772
Walt: HO HO HO!
WHAT'S THAT?

19:32.805 --> 19:34.674
Walt: HO HO HO!

19:34.707 --> 19:35.908
Claudia: BED! BED!

19:35.942 --> 19:37.710
IT'S SANTA!
ANOTHER ONE!

19:37.744 --> 19:39.312
NO! NO, IT'S NOT
ANOTHER SANTA

19:39.346 --> 19:42.449
HEADING
FOR THE FRONT DOOR,
WHICH IS UNLOCKED!

19:42.815 --> 19:43.883
OW!

19:43.916 --> 19:44.817
WHAT?

19:44.851 --> 19:49.689
UH...HO HO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
DOWN THERE?

19:49.722 --> 19:50.657
I'M SANTA,

19:50.690 --> 19:52.692
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GET BACK
IN YOUR SLEIGH

19:52.725 --> 19:55.895
AND SHOVE OFF
ON YOUR MERRY WAY
THROUGH THE SNOW.

19:55.928 --> 19:56.729
HO HO HO!

19:56.763 --> 19:59.432
WELL, I THINK
THERE'S SOME CONFUSION.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.834
SEE, I'VE BEEN COMING
TO THIS HOUSE

20:01.868 --> 20:03.770
FOR YEARS AND YEARS,

20:03.803 --> 20:06.673
SPREADING JOY. HO HO!

20:06.706 --> 20:07.807
OH, HO HO HO!

20:07.840 --> 20:09.809
WELL,
I KNOW THE PEOPLE
IN THIS HOUSE

20:09.842 --> 20:11.778
WANT ME HERE
INSTEAD OF YOU!

20:11.811 --> 20:13.746
OK, IT'S REALLY TIME
FOR YOU TO GO TO BED NOW.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.782
NO WAY. I WANT TO SEE
HOW THIS PLAYS OUT.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.717
WHY DON'T
WE JUST GO OUTSIDE
IN THE STREET

20:17.750 --> 20:20.019
AND DISCUSS IT
SENSIBLY LIKE MEN

20:20.052 --> 20:21.688
NEXT TO MY SLEIGH?

20:21.721 --> 20:25.258
HO HO HO! GLADLY.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.428
HO HO HO!

20:28.761 --> 20:31.298
ALL RIGHT, DAD...

20:31.331 --> 20:32.832
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:32.865 --> 20:35.402
LOOK, AFTER WE TALKED,
I WENT TO 4 DIFFERENT
TOY STORES

20:35.435 --> 20:38.805
AND TRIED TO FIND
THAT EVEL KNIEVEL
STUNT CYCLE

20:38.838 --> 20:39.839
THAT YOU WANTED SO BAD.

20:39.872 --> 20:40.873
YEAH, I DON'T
WANT IT ANYMORE.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.542
I WANTED IT
WHEN I WAS 11.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.345
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU WANT, THEN?

20:45.378 --> 20:47.514
I WANT YOU
TO BUTT OUT, OK?

20:47.547 --> 20:48.848
I MEAN, I WANT
TO GIVE MY KIDS

20:48.881 --> 20:50.750
THE KIND OF CHRISTMAS
YOU NEVER GAVE ME,

20:50.783 --> 20:52.719
NOT LET YOU GIVE THEM
THE KIND OF CHRISTMAS

20:52.752 --> 20:54.020
YOU NEVER GAVE ME. OK?

20:54.053 --> 20:57.724
I MEAN, IS THAT
TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.526
OK.

20:59.559 --> 21:03.763
BUT I DID FIND SOMETHING
AT THE TOY STORE.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.440
"TO HENRY,
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.342
LOVE, MOM AND DAD."

21:15.375 --> 21:18.378
SANTA NEVER BREAKS
A PROMISE.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.818
OH...AND I GOT YOU
ONE MORE THING.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.854
WHAT'S THAT, DAD?

21:29.789 --> 21:31.824
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.961
I LOVE YOU,
TOO, DAD.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.010
30-DEGREE
INCLINATION...

21:51.043 --> 21:53.680
18-DEGREE
ASCENSION...

21:53.713 --> 21:55.848
4 FEET RANGE...

21:55.882 --> 21:58.685
READY, FIRE!

21:58.718 --> 21:59.752
FIRE!

21:59.786 --> 22:01.354
WHAT?!

22:01.388 --> 22:02.822
RETREAT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

22:02.855 --> 22:04.891
I'LL TEACH YOU
TO WAKE ME UP!

22:04.924 --> 22:07.927
RETREAT!
RETREAT!
