'Summer was coming to an end.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.160
'The dawns were paler
and the mornings cool.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.710
'Yet we had few thoughts of autumn
or of harvest

00:52.760 --> 00:56.190
'for we saw the fruits of women's
labours every day.'

00:56.240 --> 00:59.430
Good morning. Morning, Fred.
Morning.

00:59.480 --> 01:05.990
'The wheel of our year turned slowly.
Work was its constant driving force,

01:06.040 --> 01:08.800
'as present yet as changeable
as the weather.'

01:25.720 --> 01:31.470
'But time passed in Poplar as it did
everywhere, holding mysteries

01:31.520 --> 01:33.440
'and secrets in its net.'

01:55.840 --> 01:57.910
We were nibbling Maraschino cherries

01:57.960 --> 02:00.790
and drinking gin cocktails
on the deck of his yacht.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.830
Gosh, I'm sorry,
did I sleep through breakfast?

02:02.880 --> 02:05.750
There's something kept warm for you
but you need to be quick about it.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.550
And then he said, "Trixie, darling,
let me take you to Monaco."

02:09.600 --> 02:11.510
Who did? Rock Hudson.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.670
In a dream she had.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.270
But then I said, "Rock,

02:14.320 --> 02:17.310
"that sounds lovely, but I'm afraid
I have to be up early to prep

02:17.360 --> 02:19.030
"and pack for my home visits."

02:19.080 --> 02:20.230
Can you imagine?

02:20.280 --> 02:23.120
I blame Christmas
and the long winter nights.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.990
Number of young women due to give
birth nine months later.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.230
There's 30 in the next
two weeks alone!

02:30.280 --> 02:33.510
And my district patient
numbers are spiralling wildly.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.950
I don't know how we're going to get
through the next month.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.750
Unless we start home visits
an hour earlier.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.150
No, he really wouldn't want me
to do that.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.670
Who wouldn't?

02:43.720 --> 02:45.400
Rock Hudson.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.710
Well, the obvious answer is you
need to attend to your social life.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.990
It's true.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.790
And it wouldn't have to be terribly
glamorous. It wouldn't have to

02:59.840 --> 03:02.030
be a yacht or gin martinis.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.200
Or Rock Hudson.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.550
Thank you, but is he really my type?

03:10.600 --> 03:12.550
She doesn't like the handsome type.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.350
Perhaps he hasn't enough film star
charisma for her.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.430
All right. Thank you.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.310
I'm sure the curate's very sweet,

03:19.360 --> 03:21.920
but I dated one once
and it has slightly put me off.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.710
Good morning. Reverend. Hello.

03:32.760 --> 03:35.390
What do you think?
It belongs to an old college friend.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.550
He said we could borrow it
if we fix it up.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.670
It ought to be a boon for
the Guides and Cubs

03:39.720 --> 03:41.110
if we can actually get it started.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.960
Do you think it might make it
all the way to Monaco?

03:45.720 --> 03:49.510
Actually, Nurse Franklin,
you might be just the person I need.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.670
Really?

03:50.720 --> 03:52.640
For advice on a matter of style.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.630
I didn't think the church funds
would cover a coat of paint

03:59.680 --> 04:02.350
but Fred thinks he can get me
some cheap.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.830
I could do you eight
gallons of blue for five bob

04:04.880 --> 04:06.350
or some yella.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.230
Well, I'm not quite sure what
buses are wearing this season,

04:09.280 --> 04:11.470
but I wouldn't have thought yellow.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.840
Maybe blue will suit.
What kind of blue?

04:15.320 --> 04:18.510
It's blue. Fred, have I not
taught you anything?

04:18.560 --> 04:21.790
Is it duck egg blue,
full of the warmth of summer?

04:21.839 --> 04:24.710
Well, on the tin,
it just says...blue.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.920
Fred, I hope you don't think you can
leave that thing parked there.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.190
I suggest you leave
your money in your pocket.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.950
My experience of Fred's deals is
you always regret getting involved.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.320
Received and understood.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.230
We've quite a full list
this afternoon,

04:46.280 --> 04:48.190
so you may have to be patient.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.560
Take a seat. Thank you.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.270
Sorry, Sister.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.910
I was helping one of my home visits
to breastfeed. Mrs Lloyd again.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.270
Baby just wouldn't latch on.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.630
They only keep you as long as
you let them, Nurse Miller.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.390
Now hurry up
and make yourself useful.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.270
Don't you think, Sister, especially
during these busier periods,

05:12.320 --> 05:15.350
that timed appointments might move
things along rather more swiftly?

05:15.400 --> 05:16.710
Hello, Mrs Brindle.

05:16.760 --> 05:20.760
Heavens! What a whopper!
Easy to see who baby takes after.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.160
If you could just pop baby on
the scales for me, Mrs Brindle.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.470
You registered with us quite close
to your due date, Mrs Doyle.

05:31.520 --> 05:35.560
We only just - myself and my husband
- we only recently came to London.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.310
It will mean moving
things along quite quickly.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.400
We'll set up a home
visit for tomorrow.

05:43.680 --> 05:47.710
I see Dr Turner has done routine
bloods and a pelvic assessment.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.190
Everything seems to be normal.

05:49.240 --> 05:52.830
I told the doctor I'm worried
my baby isn't moving so much.

05:52.880 --> 05:57.150
And I'm sure Dr Turner told you that
baby's movements are very varied.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.350
There is no right amount.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.550
You might try drinking
a glass of cold water.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.270
That will often get baby to kick.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.030
But you will check? Do tests?

06:06.080 --> 06:08.270
We'll listen in to baby's heart.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.870
But first, we need some
details from you.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.150
Let's start with your maiden name.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.110
What would
you need to know that for?

06:15.160 --> 06:18.080
We need to get a full picture
of your family health history.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.270
Stocks. Phoebe Stocks.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.680
And do you have someone other
than your husband to help out?

06:28.760 --> 06:30.840
No, I don't know anyone.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.230
Could all mothers keep their
children under control, please?

06:36.280 --> 06:38.030
And once you've been
seen by the midwife,

06:38.080 --> 06:40.230
can you please make your way out?

06:40.280 --> 06:42.030
Nurse Mount.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.590
If you think you're
here to bawl like a publican...

06:44.640 --> 06:46.790
Hardly, Sister.
Certainly loud and clear, but I...

06:46.840 --> 06:50.310
Or upset mothers with unhelpful
remarks about their babies,

06:50.360 --> 06:54.030
I think your time would be
better spent elsewhere.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.120
Beg your pardon?

06:57.720 --> 07:00.190
Here are your district
patients for today.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.270
I know Nurse Noakes will be relieved
to have your support.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.870
Sister Julienne, you know
that I came to Nonnatus House

07:05.920 --> 07:08.230
specifically to
enhance my midwifery.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.350
I do. But needs must.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.910
And, as our most recent
addition to the staff,

07:12.960 --> 07:16.240
your transfer will be
less of an upheaval for the mothers.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.470
I will admit that midwifery's been
quite the dizzying

07:20.520 --> 07:22.110
shift of tempo for me.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.430
But I know that I can learn
and adjust to it.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.200
For now, our decision must stand.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.590
There! Did you feel it?

07:40.640 --> 07:42.430
Jesus, he nearly had my hand off!

07:42.480 --> 07:44.470
He'll be playing
fly-half for Ulster one day.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.150
He? No. It'll be a girl

07:47.200 --> 07:48.990
and she'll have all
the boys after her.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.920
Just like her beautiful mother?

07:58.720 --> 08:02.000
Declan, was it the right thing?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.960
To leave everything and come here?

08:08.440 --> 08:12.310
Not everything.
We still have each other.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.640
And we brought this little
fella along.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.720
The receipt from the registry
office. I paid them today.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.080
It took a fair bite out of my first
wage packet, though.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.950
It's what we agreed, Phoebe.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.230
Aye.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.430
In a grim wee room instead of us
both at the altar.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.750
Well, it's not our fault neither
church will marry us!

08:46.800 --> 08:48.200
I know. I just...

08:49.800 --> 08:51.760
I wish there was
a way we could do it right.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.030
Maurice Glennon, get
back in that bed!

09:26.080 --> 09:27.630
The nurse'll be here any minute.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.560
Doreen, don't fret!
I'll be back at work tomorrow.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.200
It's all very well them
saying you need bed rest.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.870
You should've been
back at work days ago.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.390
Let the Nurse in, Gillian.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.510
They won't hold that job for you
past this week.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.990
And trying to feed us
on the sick club money's worse than

09:53.040 --> 09:54.710
when we used to have
the ration book.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.990
Doreen, we'll manage!

09:57.040 --> 09:59.470
We always have, always will.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.320
He's just through here, Nurse.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.430
Mrs Glennon. I'm Nurse Mount.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.830
I hope your husband's been getting
plenty of bed rest.

10:06.880 --> 10:10.550
Haven't moved my backside off this
mattress, have I, Gillian?

10:10.600 --> 10:13.190
I understand a fall at work
gave your back a very nasty jolt.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.110
Yes, off the ladder of his crane,
Nurse.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.830
He's been off close to two months.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.670
A fractured "vert-i-bray".
It's in his spine.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.550
You've got some competition there.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.400
Gillian says she's going to
be a nurse.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.750
Any pain in the back still?

10:28.800 --> 10:30.950
Nothing. I'm fit as a fiddle.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.750
The steroid injections Doctor Turner
prescribed your husband seem
to be doing their job.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.750
This should be the last.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.160
And then he can get back to work?
We hope so.

10:49.520 --> 10:53.270
Mr Glennon, how did you get that?
Another accident at work?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.000
A souvenir from me army days.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.390
I hope you've got a better touch
than that other nurse.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.880
I've had no complaints so far.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.240
That's a lovely thing, Sister.

11:10.760 --> 11:15.190
Isn't it? An exquisite
cartography of the heavens.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.390
I suppose some of these old
instruments are a bit

11:17.440 --> 11:20.160
out of date now, what with recent
scientific discoveries.

11:22.320 --> 11:25.590
I think you'll find that
old instruments,

11:25.640 --> 11:29.760
if they are of good quality,
retain their value and purpose.

11:31.440 --> 11:35.870
Neither this reliable globe nor I,

11:35.920 --> 11:39.070
though both old instruments,

11:39.120 --> 11:41.150
are by any means redundant.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.430
Oh, of course not, Sister!

11:43.480 --> 11:46.360
I didn't mean anything against you,
Sister Monica Joan!

11:49.080 --> 11:51.390
You look like you're
waiting to see the headmaster.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.430
Almost.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.950
I'm waiting to talk to
Sister Julienne about arrangements

11:55.000 --> 11:56.230
for the harvest festival.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.630
I have an idea to distribute boxes,
like this one,

11:59.680 --> 12:01.630
into which people can
place their donations.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.070
The boxes are then collected
by a whole team of volunteers

12:04.120 --> 12:06.230
just before the harvest festival
celebration...

12:06.280 --> 12:10.030
I'd love to help, but today is
terribly busy. And tomorrow.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.710
And then it's my first
day off in quite a while, so...

12:12.760 --> 12:16.400
No, I wasn't for a moment trying to
recruit you, Nurse Franklin.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.320
Did you plunge headlong into
the murky world of Mr Buckle?

12:23.240 --> 12:25.390
Did you buy Fred's dodgy paint?

12:25.440 --> 12:28.750
No. No, I decided to
heed your advice. Thank you.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.070
Very wise.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.840
Perhaps I could say a proper
thank you, if you'd let me.

12:35.240 --> 12:37.870
Would you care to join me
for a lovely day watching some

12:37.920 --> 12:39.430
first-class cricket

12:39.480 --> 12:41.710
on your day off,
unless you've plans?

12:41.760 --> 12:43.870
I don't think I know the first
thing about cricket.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.270
Isn't it terribly complicated?

12:45.320 --> 12:47.870
It's just a man with a stick
trying to hit a ball.

12:47.920 --> 12:51.270
The key ingredients are
a splendid picnic hamper,

12:51.320 --> 12:53.720
a clear blue sky and...

12:54.840 --> 12:57.080
Well, one's choice of companion.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.440
I'd love to.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.710
I think it will be rather lovely.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.230
Ladies with the latest millinery,

13:07.280 --> 13:09.750
promenading in the
members' enclosure!

13:09.800 --> 13:12.710
Actually, I think
you may be confusing it with Ascot.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.950
Sipping long glasses of Pimm's
and munching on strawberries.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.510
And Wimbledon.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.750
And I dare say we may hobnob
with the great and the good.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.920
Gosh! But what does one wear?

13:26.400 --> 13:28.790
What exactly are you doing, Sister?

13:28.840 --> 13:33.590
Making a sheaf loaf for the harvest
festival. Or at least trying.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.550
My mother made it look
so terribly easy.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.950
Perhaps you're being just a little
too ambitious, Sister Winifred.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.880
But you can't have a harvest
festival without a sheaf loaf.

14:47.160 --> 14:50.430
Peter, it's a minor matter. Just let
the curate park his bus here.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.150
It is not a minor matter, Camilla.
It is the law.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.990
Yes, but it's not as
if anyone killed anyone.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.830
If we let people pick and choose
what laws to obey, what do we get?

14:59.880 --> 15:01.160
Anarchy. Yes, I know.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.030
Mr Glennon, why are you out of bed?

15:15.080 --> 15:16.230
Just let me have the chitty.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.310
I said we might be able to sign you
fit for return to work, but...

15:19.360 --> 15:21.670
You've a high temperature.
It's probably close to 100.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.430
There'll be no work for you today.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.950
There'll be none all month
if I don't get there and clock in.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.430
Mr Glennon, where's your wife?

15:27.480 --> 15:30.270
Stitching shirts at
three shillings a box.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.230
You think I can lay in bed
with that going on?

15:32.280 --> 15:35.270
Mr Glennon,
on to the bed with you right now!

15:35.320 --> 15:37.110
Gillian,
I need you to telephone Dr Turner.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.510
Tell him he must come quickly.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.590
We don't need the doctor coming!

15:44.120 --> 15:46.190
It's just a piece of paper
to make it legal!

15:46.240 --> 15:48.670
Why is it so important
we do it in a church?

15:48.720 --> 15:52.830
Because I want to take my vows under
the eyes of God, not just the law!

15:52.880 --> 15:54.830
I cannot see how anyone,
raised the way we were,

15:54.880 --> 15:57.230
wouldn't want to
turn their back on the whole thing!

15:57.280 --> 15:59.350
It's not just for us.
It's for the baby!

15:59.400 --> 16:01.400
You think I'm not
thinking about the baby?

16:03.200 --> 16:05.720
But if you want it to stay a bastard,
that's fine!

16:06.880 --> 16:08.800
Let's not get ourselves married!

16:10.920 --> 16:14.750
Did you hear everything or would you
like me to write it down for you?

16:14.800 --> 16:17.070
I'm the midwife here to see
Mrs Doyle.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.830
Well, I didn't think you
were Alma Cogan!

16:19.880 --> 16:21.200
I'll be out of your way.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.750
And this is the rubber sheet
to cover the bed with

16:29.800 --> 16:31.120
when the time comes.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.590
I thought you might be
interested in coming to
some of our Mothercraft classes.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.750
There's still time to learn
a little about baby

16:42.800 --> 16:45.430
and get to know some other mothers.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.840
That'd be nice.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.360
I'm sorry about earlier.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.350
Declan's not always so unpleasant.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.800
I'm quite sure he's not.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.870
But it's not good for you
or for baby to be getting upset

16:59.920 --> 17:01.240
and arguing like that.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.480
We eloped.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.839
Sounded more romantic than this.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.359
I wanted a church wedding,
but he's Catholic, I'm Protestant.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.119
The two of us grew up
on neighbouring streets in Belfast.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.040
We only met because of work.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.119
Our parents didn't like it at all.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.630
And then you got pregnant.

17:28.680 --> 17:34.840
Back home, a girl like me,
pregnant and not married...

17:36.400 --> 17:40.120
..she has to hate herself for the
shame she's brought to her family.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.040
And with a boy from the other side?

17:47.880 --> 17:49.800
That's the world we ran away from.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.430
Your father's very stubborn
and foolish, Gillian.

17:56.480 --> 17:59.430
What if you'd fallen
and damaged your back again?

17:59.480 --> 18:01.950
You've a fever. You're wheezing.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.830
Your heart's banging like
a barn door in a hurricane.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.470
What's the matter with him, Nurse?

18:06.520 --> 18:08.040
Feel your father's pulse.

18:09.760 --> 18:13.000
His heart's working too hard
and we need to find out why.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.950
Hello? Go on. Doctor!

18:18.000 --> 18:20.150
Tell him I'm on the mend,
Nurse. Please?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.040
That's for the doctor to decide.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.030
Thank you for coming so promptly.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.030
Mr Glennon,

18:27.080 --> 18:30.870
I hope you haven't been getting
on the wrong side of Nurse Mount.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.840
I believe we've established
who's boss.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.320
That's all.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.270
How long have you had this rash?

19:12.320 --> 19:14.680
It's nothing.
Just itches a bit is all.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.270
And the chest is crackling.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.190
Possibly a result of you
spending so much time in bed.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.150
There you go. I should have been
up and about days ago.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.150
I'm going to prescribe you some
antibiotics for your chest.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.830
We'll see how it responds.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.190
You'll sign the chitty,
though, won't you?

19:31.240 --> 19:33.750
I can send Gillian with word
I'll start work tomorrow.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.630
I'm afraid you won't be going back
to your job yet, Mr Glennon.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.640
But I've got to!
I got a family to feed!

19:43.280 --> 19:45.750
Everyone gets into
an awful tangle over this

19:45.800 --> 19:48.190
problem between the Catholics
and the Protestants.

19:48.240 --> 19:50.990
Obviously, the district round gives
me plenty to get my teeth into.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.590
I've never really understood it.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.390
I mean, they both go to church
and pray to the same God.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.030
The point is, Sister Julienne knows
I came to Nonnatus House to

19:58.080 --> 19:59.310
gain midwifery experience.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.710
I told Phoebe Doyle she should go
and talk to Tom Hereward

20:01.760 --> 20:03.550
and that he was very nice.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.950
And he is.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.070
I don't know why you all thought
he wasn't my type.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.320
Think the only one who thought
he wasn't was you.

20:12.040 --> 20:15.190
Now the problem is deciding
how alluring one should make

20:15.240 --> 20:16.720
oneself for a date with a curate.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.320
Oh!

20:28.680 --> 20:30.120
What a lovely thing.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.640
I have a scarf this would go
just perfectly with.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.030
What are you doing?

20:41.080 --> 20:44.150
Well, I was just thinking this would
make the perfect accessory and if...

20:44.200 --> 20:46.400
Would you not touch
my private things again?

20:56.760 --> 20:58.710
Are we still not getting any post?

20:58.760 --> 21:01.990
None here, and apparently
none at the surgery either.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.590
They say the strike could
go on another week.

21:04.640 --> 21:08.390
Can I show Colin my Airfix
Supermarine Spitfire when he comes?

21:08.440 --> 21:10.390
Do you have any time
before your outing?

21:10.440 --> 21:11.790
Have you got your packed lunch?

21:11.840 --> 21:12.950
And who's Colin?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.470
It'll only take a minute.
Yes, I have.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.310
And Colin's a new boy at school.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.440
That'll be Colin.

21:22.760 --> 21:26.310
Hello! Come in. He's got his lunch.
It's just through here.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.830
This is Colin.
Hello, Timothy's mum and dad.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.230
Hello. Hello.
No time to see the Spitfire.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.040
Goodbye, Timothy's mum and dad.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.950
Ah, yes. The cricketing jaunt.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.550
I must say, I find Mr Hereward
very agreeable.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.550
Yes, so do I.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.470
Perhaps he'll bowl a maiden over!

21:53.520 --> 21:55.150
Excuse me?

21:55.200 --> 21:59.360
Fred tells me it's a cricket joke.
Apparently, it's... it's quite funny.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.990
Hello. Good morning.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.120
You look lovely. You look very nice.

22:20.520 --> 22:23.710
I've had to make a change or two
to the outing I had planned.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.510
A day at Lord's would be splendid,

22:25.560 --> 22:27.830
but the Oval at Vauxhall
would be lovely, too.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.430
You see, I have done some homework.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.590
Ah. Actually, we're going to
Clacton-on-Sea.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.510
Essex are at home to Warwickshire.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.870
Clacton?
And we'll be taking the bus.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.190
Really? Just for the two of us?

22:39.240 --> 22:41.390
Well, I'm afraid their trip
to the zoo was cancelled

22:41.440 --> 22:43.990
at terribly short notice.
Whose trip?

22:44.040 --> 22:46.240
And we couldn't not give them
a treat of some sort.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.720
I'm sorry you lost your job.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.830
It's not just the wages.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.440
I hate seeing Doreen
coming home so worn out.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.760
And I miss the work.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.870
Being stuck in here, weeks on end,
doing nothing.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.720
I can't stand to be idle, either.

23:29.960 --> 23:33.590
You wouldn't believe
the view from the cab of my crane.

23:33.640 --> 23:36.790
Everything so small down below.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.630
Isn't it lonely?
Up there all on your own?

23:39.680 --> 23:40.920
Peaceful, I'd call it.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.600
All alone, with your thoughts.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.240
You'll be back up there.
I promise you, you will.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.870
It should be a terrific match.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.310
Yes, I'm looking forward to it(!)

24:12.360 --> 24:13.750
If the wicket offers some turn,

24:13.800 --> 24:16.680
then Bill Greensmith's googly
ought to be quite a handful.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.310
I'm very sorry,

24:19.360 --> 24:22.560
but you do know I haven't the
first idea what any of that means?

24:24.120 --> 24:27.270
Nurse Trixie, Colin Monk's eaten
all of his packed lunch

24:27.320 --> 24:31.000
and two spiders for a bet, and now
he's been sick all over the floor!

24:40.120 --> 24:43.110
This will, at first, feel
like a terribly awkward procedure

24:43.160 --> 24:45.910
but you'll have rather more chances
to practise this little skill

24:45.960 --> 24:47.710
than you could ever imagine.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.630
The first objective,
if at all possible,

24:50.680 --> 24:53.870
is to avoid jabbing the pin
into young sir or,

24:53.920 --> 24:56.150
of course, young madam....

24:56.200 --> 24:59.870
whilst also avoiding
injury to oneself.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.200
I pity the poor wee things
with us as mothers!

25:05.760 --> 25:07.350
Oh, dear!
Are you in a bit of a muddle?

25:07.400 --> 25:08.640
Let's start again.

25:10.200 --> 25:13.120
We won't miss the start of play,
though, will we, Reverend?

25:14.800 --> 25:16.830
I managed to mop up most of it,

25:16.880 --> 25:21.110
although the smell's lingering
somewhat. How's the patient?

25:25.560 --> 25:28.710
Now, I want you all here nice and
promptly for our next class, ladies.

25:28.760 --> 25:31.920
We'll be unravelling
the mysteries of breastfeeding.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.230
You look like you enjoyed yourself.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.550
I did.

25:43.600 --> 25:47.230
And you look all sweet, like
we didn't have a hell of a row.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.760
I'm here to apologise for that.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.200
You're forgiven.

26:04.800 --> 26:08.190
Now, who could have taken
things from a charity box?

26:08.240 --> 26:09.280
Who indeed?

26:12.920 --> 26:15.920
Sister Monica Joan,
you didn't by any chance...

26:17.360 --> 26:18.870
Ah!

26:18.920 --> 26:21.590
Sister,
these things were left as donations.

26:21.640 --> 26:26.390
Yes. Isn't that kind? But I mustn't
keep them all to myself.

26:26.440 --> 26:32.400
Mars is very tasty. Please help
yourself to Saturn or Jupiter.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.270
It shouldn't take more than an hour
to get back to Poplar,

26:53.320 --> 26:55.670
once you get this wreck
started again.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.190
You think we should turn back?

26:57.240 --> 26:58.390
Well, yes.

26:58.440 --> 26:59.990
But the cricket!

27:00.040 --> 27:02.070
We'll obviously miss the start
of play, but I...

27:02.120 --> 27:03.320

a mile or two back.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.790
I'll call for a mechanic

Perhaps we could try another outing,
just the two of us.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.800
Perhaps when I've had a little time
to recover from this one.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.280
I am disturbed by this
ghostly apparition.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.640
It is very unsettling.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.440
Oh!

29:31.960 --> 29:33.000
Oh!

29:36.200 --> 29:38.910
Come along, young man.
Your dad'll be home soon

29:38.960 --> 29:41.030
and we can't keep him
waiting for his dinner.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.630
What is for dinner?

29:42.680 --> 29:44.230
Someone's feeling better!

29:44.280 --> 29:47.670
I have tried to tell him insects
aren't good for the digestion.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.790
Never mind. He seems fine now.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.390
And they've had such fun.

29:52.440 --> 29:57.710
Yes. I worry that Colin gets lonely
sometimes, as an only child.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.750
I worry for Timothy, too.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.520
Would you have liked another?

30:02.880 --> 30:07.440
He's actually my step-son.
Dr Turner was widowed when we met.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.390
My husband and I couldn't have
children of our own.

30:12.440 --> 30:16.790
But Colin's mum had died
and he'd been put in foster care.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.910
He knows he's adopted.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.510
And we all know we're lucky.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.750
And all the way along,
the more love he's needed,

30:23.800 --> 30:25.910
the more love we've found.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.120
We haven't run out yet.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.320
But I will if he doesn't get a move
on! Colin!

30:36.960 --> 30:40.520
Perseus and Cassiopeia.

30:41.920 --> 30:48.120
And between the two lies the Perseus
Double Cluster. Remarkable!

30:49.520 --> 30:50.870
It's working all right, then?

30:50.920 --> 30:53.840
Oh, it certainly is.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.030
Gillian? You've got to come.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.590
Dad said I wasn't to trouble you,
but he's got really bad.

31:10.640 --> 31:13.230
Where's your mother?
Out at Mr Goldman's all day now

31:13.280 --> 31:15.600
cos somebody has to put
food on the bloody table.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.990
I can feel baby's head's engaged.

31:23.040 --> 31:26.070
I also need to go to the toilet
a lot more now.

31:26.120 --> 31:30.190
That's because there's more pressure
low down on your bladder.

31:30.240 --> 31:33.110
It all means baby's getting ready
to come out and meet the world.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.320
The wee thing must have
heard the news.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.230
It's official now.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.590
Congratulations!

31:40.640 --> 31:42.550
Not a church wedding.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.630
Declan would've never've
converted to my faith.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.350
So how does it feel to be Mrs Doyle?

31:48.400 --> 31:49.560
I'm married...

31:51.480 --> 31:53.680
..though I'm not sure
I really feel it.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.870
Nurse. Mr Doyle.

31:59.920 --> 32:04.350
I should say thank you for pushing
Phoebe to go to these classes

32:04.400 --> 32:08.430
and for meeting other girls in her
condition. She's full of it.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.990
And spending less time
thinking about making her peace with

32:11.040 --> 32:12.230
the Church. I must say,

32:12.280 --> 32:14.950
this whole business seems to bring
her more grief than joy.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.670
If it was up to me,
I'd shut all the churches.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.880
Turn them into bingo halls.
Something useful.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.240
But I know it's important to Phoebe.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.950
Come on, now.
Let's have you on your side.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.550
No more pills. They make me worse.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.920
Hold on to him, Gillian.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.830
Why isn't he getting any better?

32:37.880 --> 32:40.390
Sometimes,
what's wrong with someone stays

32:40.440 --> 32:42.040
a mystery for quite a while.

32:44.320 --> 32:47.560
Did you get those scars
fighting in the Far East, Mr Glennon?

32:50.720 --> 32:54.120
Gillian, why don't you pop next door
and put the kettle on for us?

33:00.520 --> 33:04.550
They're scars for the treatment
of leg ulcers, aren't they?

33:04.600 --> 33:07.280
Treatment by doctors with no access
to proper equipment.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.000
Doctors in a prisoner of war camp.

33:17.160 --> 33:20.400
We were defending an airfield
in Java when the Japs came.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.680
Never had a chance.

33:26.960 --> 33:30.640
They sent us up the Straits of
Malacca to build the Burma Railway.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.400
260 miles of track.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.560
Eating rats and flies.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.440
Fighting over a grain of rice.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.920
And you decided to act as if
none of it had ever happened.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.670
My mother,

34:04.720 --> 34:10.070
when there was a storm, she used to
be sure to open the front door

34:10.120 --> 34:11.440
and the back door...

34:13.600 --> 34:16.960
..so the thunder and lightning
would go straight through.

34:19.159 --> 34:22.239
"Don't let your misfortunes
find a home," she'd tell me.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.469
It's about Mr Glennon, Doctor.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.110
Yes?
His condition is considerably worse.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.270
He's not responding
to the antibiotics?

34:40.320 --> 34:44.350
Not at all. Mr Glennon was
a prisoner of war in Burma.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.790
Could it be some kind
of tropical disease?

34:46.840 --> 34:49.909
It would be an extremely
long incubation period.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.080
16 years.

34:53.040 --> 34:56.190
Sister Monica Joan, have you seen
this? You have to look.

34:56.239 --> 34:57.830
It's proper fascinating!

34:57.880 --> 34:59.630
The American satellite they sent up

34:59.680 --> 35:03.830
has taken the first ever photographs
of planet Earth from space.

35:03.880 --> 35:06.590
What could be more fascinating
than a first-hand

35:06.640 --> 35:10.240
account of Halley's Comet in 240 BC?

35:11.400 --> 35:12.910
I want nothing to do with it!

35:12.960 --> 35:13.950
But Sister...

35:14.000 --> 35:15.790
Do you not recall the catastrophe

35:15.840 --> 35:18.910
when the Gorgon saw herself
in the mirror?

35:18.960 --> 35:23.030
Or how Lot's wife looked back and
was turned into a pillar of salt?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.790
Well, yeah, but...
I'm disappointed in you, Fred.

35:25.840 --> 35:30.800
I don't understand how you can't
see that this is an abomination!

35:33.520 --> 35:36.070
Yes, yes. I think
we have what we need.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.310
Goodbye.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.030
What did they say, Doctor?

35:39.080 --> 35:43.630
According to the Hospital
for Tropical Diseases in St Pancras,

35:43.680 --> 35:46.510
the time delay between
contracting the disease

35:46.560 --> 35:49.390
and the appearance of symptoms
isn't atypical.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.990
Do they know what it could be?

35:51.040 --> 35:55.030
They think that what's causing
the infections and sepsis

35:55.080 --> 35:58.150
in Mr Glennon's body is... Ah!

35:58.200 --> 36:00.310
Strongyoides Stercoralis.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.670
What on earth is that?

36:01.720 --> 36:03.590
A roundworm.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.030
Its larva enters through
the sole of the naked foot,

36:07.080 --> 36:10.430
then migrates through
the circulation system to the lungs,

36:10.480 --> 36:13.390
crawling up the respiratory
tract to be swallowed

36:13.440 --> 36:16.110
and make its home
in the small intestine.

36:16.160 --> 36:17.590
But why is it active now?

36:17.640 --> 36:19.910
The steroid I prescribed.

36:19.960 --> 36:22.670
I'm told that there are cases
where the injection has woken

36:22.720 --> 36:24.320
the worm and caused it to replicate.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.390
It's remarkable that you spotted it,
Nurse Mount.

36:29.440 --> 36:31.390
What put you onto the right track?

36:31.440 --> 36:34.030
I must have read something
in a medical magazine.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.560
You know how these things
stick in the mind.

36:40.840 --> 36:46.030
I fear the worst should
I look upon that unholy image.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.150
Absolutely, Sister.

36:48.200 --> 36:51.840
And yet, my crime, if crime it be...

36:53.840 --> 36:55.830
..is my weakness.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.640
I can resist no more.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.400
This is our Earth?

37:05.040 --> 37:06.400
How ridiculous!

37:11.560 --> 37:13.070
Mr Glennon,

37:13.120 --> 37:16.230
we think the problem is something
you picked up in Burma

37:16.280 --> 37:19.030
and it's lead to you
developing pneumonia.

37:19.080 --> 37:22.560
We'll need to take you to hospital
for tests and observation.

37:26.160 --> 37:30.550
He never told me a thing
about his time in a prison camp.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.470
It's not an uncommon thing

37:32.520 --> 37:34.990
for someone to keep an experience
like this to themselves.

37:35.040 --> 37:38.040
And there's me been pushing him
to be getting back to work.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.270
I can't help thinking
this is all my fault.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.230
No. It's not, is it, Nurse Patsy?

37:45.280 --> 37:48.080
It's not Mum.
It's the infection making him sick.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.710
That's right.

37:51.760 --> 37:55.880
And that's why your dad is going
to need a lot of help to
make him better.

37:58.840 --> 38:00.000
Help from both of us.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.670
Spitfires weren't bombers, Tim.
They were fighter planes!

38:26.720 --> 38:27.760
Pedant!

38:29.000 --> 38:31.400
Somebody's expanding
their vocabulary.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.230
I made a new friend yesterday.

38:36.280 --> 38:39.270
Did you? Jean Monk, Colin's mother.

38:39.320 --> 38:40.550
Colin?

38:40.600 --> 38:42.600
Cub Colin. Ah, yes.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.590
Jean was telling me
that Colin is adopted.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.590
Really?

38:49.640 --> 38:51.640
You know what I'm going to say,
don't you?

38:53.920 --> 38:56.710
I know how much you want a baby

38:56.760 --> 38:59.950
and I think you know how much
I'd like one, too.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.670
I really don't believe
I'd have to carry

39:01.720 --> 39:05.190
a child inside my body
for it to feel like ours.

39:05.240 --> 39:08.910
If I felt that, it would mean
that loving Timothy has
taught me nothing!

39:08.960 --> 39:12.670
Shelagh, if you want to adopt,
we can look into adopting.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.680
Really? Really.

39:16.160 --> 39:20.230
I know as little about this from
a parent's perspective as you do.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.590
But we can work it out together.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.080
First time for both of us.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.960
Just hope Timothy agrees.

39:31.560 --> 39:32.550
People have responded

39:32.600 --> 39:35.670
so generously with donations
for the harvest festival.

39:35.720 --> 39:38.830
Mr Hereward is a breath
of fresh air, isn't he?

39:38.880 --> 39:40.910
Yes. He's quite a chap.

39:40.960 --> 39:44.550
He's very good at making more work
for us in our busiest times.

39:44.600 --> 39:49.150
His harvest festival parcels
aren't going to wrap themselves.

39:49.200 --> 39:53.950
Sister Monica Joan, I think Fred
rather thinks he's upset you again.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.310
Something about a photograph.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.080
Oh, no. No.

39:59.560 --> 40:03.870
Fred has the foolish idea that
the mystery of the stars

40:03.920 --> 40:07.110
and planets is a fragile thing.

40:11.120 --> 40:15.240
We have to realise that we have
nothing at all to fear from science.

40:52.240 --> 40:55.270
Patsy? We thought you were
coming back for pudding.

40:55.320 --> 40:58.070
Sister Monica Joan is starting
to chew the cutlery!

40:58.120 --> 41:01.110
Telephone call.
It was about Mr Glennon.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.830
The chap you thought had some
sort of tropical disease?

41:03.880 --> 41:05.070
And I was right.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.040
Only Dr Turner says the recovery
rates aren't at all high.

41:13.600 --> 41:18.390
But you gave him a chance.
And that's the thing to remember.

41:18.440 --> 41:22.190
How did you even know to
consider such an exotic thing?

41:22.240 --> 41:23.840
Because of the scars on his legs.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.000
I've seen them before.

41:30.440 --> 41:31.950
Until I was nine-years-old,

41:32.000 --> 41:35.630
I was living a life
of privilege in Singapore.

41:35.680 --> 41:39.910
Two weeks later, my mother, sister
and I were separated from my father

41:39.960 --> 41:43.030
and put in a Japanese
internment camp.

41:43.080 --> 41:47.310
We were beaten and tortured
for the slightest misdemeanours.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.840
I have so few things to
remember my family by.

41:51.640 --> 41:53.240
They took everything from us.

41:56.200 --> 42:00.510
There was a makeshift hospital.
Just another hut.

42:00.560 --> 42:04.320
I was still a child but I felt drawn
to it, helped where I could.

42:08.160 --> 42:11.400
You never forget what dreadful
cruelty people are capable of.

42:15.120 --> 42:18.760
War leaves us all a lot poorer
than it finds us, doesn't it?

42:20.800 --> 42:24.150
Everyone has their story.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.830
But we can't let it affect our work.

42:26.880 --> 42:28.430
We have to rise above it.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.990
Why? Why must I rise above it?

42:31.040 --> 42:32.350
Oh, Patsy, come down and...

42:32.400 --> 42:36.350
I saw my sister and mother
die of disease and malnutrition!

42:36.400 --> 42:38.430
Patsy, I had no idea. I'm so sorry.

42:38.480 --> 42:41.030
And I'm sorry if everyone thinks
that I lack compassion.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.310
They know you don't.

42:42.360 --> 42:45.390
But sometimes patients need
to see that you care.

42:45.440 --> 42:48.510
In the hell I grew up in,
what was important was what we did,

42:48.560 --> 42:51.160
not some great show of
sentiment and emotion.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.720
So, fire away.

43:04.960 --> 43:07.430
If you did adopt
a little sister or brother,

43:07.480 --> 43:09.280
would I have to share my bedroom?

43:11.200 --> 43:12.400
Do you want to? No.

43:13.560 --> 43:17.270
Would I still get the same pocket
money? I wouldn't get half?

43:17.320 --> 43:19.480
No. You wouldn't get half.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.990
Could they play piano
at the choir practice

43:23.040 --> 43:25.470
so I could play cricket instead?

43:25.520 --> 43:28.150
I think that's a possibility.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.280
So, what's the verdict?

43:31.560 --> 43:34.520
I think...it would be good.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.840
Good morning!

43:54.320 --> 43:56.950
Wherever she was going,
she seemed in a terrific hurry.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.350
Who's that?

43:58.400 --> 44:00.070
Nurse Mount.

44:00.120 --> 44:01.830
She's been gone for
several hours now.

44:01.880 --> 44:05.230
She hasn't cleared her rota or told
anyone when she might return.

44:05.280 --> 44:08.030
Patsy was up and out first thing
and nobody's heard from her since.

44:08.080 --> 44:10.790
It means that Chummy's single-handed
again on the district rota

44:10.840 --> 44:12.320
and having to cover for her.

44:19.520 --> 44:20.880
She was in a prison camp.

44:22.360 --> 44:24.710
And at nine-years-old.

44:24.760 --> 44:27.510
It must have
been unimaginably awful.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.310
We had a bit of a set-to.

44:29.360 --> 44:31.670
She seemed to think none of us
really understood her.

44:31.720 --> 44:34.270
And now nobody knows
where she's gone.

44:34.320 --> 44:37.230
Do you fear that she might have left
Nonnatus House altogether?

44:37.280 --> 44:40.590
I did. But all of her clothes
are still in her wardrobe.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.960
Yes. You just need to
calm down a little and...

44:51.360 --> 44:53.150
Mr Doyle...

44:53.200 --> 44:54.550
Mr Doyle, could you just tell me,

44:54.600 --> 44:56.600
have your wife's waters
actually broken?

45:02.480 --> 45:04.120
Heart rate's nice and steady.

45:08.280 --> 45:10.800
Baby's obviously ready to come
and see the world.

45:15.320 --> 45:16.360
Breathe deeply.

45:22.360 --> 45:24.440
Push a little. Not too hard.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.390
I can't do it any more.

45:57.440 --> 46:01.110
You can. A small gentle push for me,
Phoebe.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.790
Ahh... help me!

46:05.840 --> 46:07.550
You're doing wonderfully.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.790
Just keep calm and breathe.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.000
It won't be long now.

46:18.840 --> 46:21.190
Here comes your baby, Phoebe.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.280
Gently now. Gently.

46:27.560 --> 46:30.280
And the head's out!
Shoulders are coming.

46:39.200 --> 46:40.240
It's a boy!

46:58.800 --> 47:00.520
Hello, wee fella!

47:06.240 --> 47:08.640
We just need to wait for
the placenta now, Phoebe.

47:16.520 --> 47:18.840
Would you like to meet your son,
Mr Doyle?

47:24.480 --> 47:28.160
Mr Doyle, just one moment, please.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.440
Isn't he beautiful?

47:35.200 --> 47:36.920
He's the best thing I ever saw.

47:39.800 --> 47:40.840
Cynthia...

47:44.200 --> 47:46.870
..baby's not pinking up
quite as much as he should.

47:46.920 --> 47:47.960
Oh.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.150
I'll try the mucus extractor.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.360
Is something wrong?

47:54.520 --> 47:57.230
Baby's breathing
is a little laboured.

47:57.280 --> 47:59.070
What does that mean?

47:59.120 --> 48:00.790
It's all right, Phoebe.

48:00.840 --> 48:04.510
Nurse Franklin just needs to help
baby get his breathing
started properly.

48:04.560 --> 48:06.950
Declan, didn't I say
about him not kicking?

48:07.000 --> 48:10.830
Shh. Settle now. The midwives
know what they're doing.

48:10.880 --> 48:13.350
I'm just going to
rub his back for a few moments.

48:13.400 --> 48:14.560
Declan!

48:15.680 --> 48:17.280
I'm scared we're going to lose him.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.480
Oh, God! And I feared for his soul!

48:24.040 --> 48:25.070
Declan!

48:25.120 --> 48:27.680
Mr Doyle, your wife needs you here!

48:28.800 --> 48:30.720
Please tell me he'll be all right!

48:32.160 --> 48:34.670
Sometimes, baby needs
a little encouragement

48:34.720 --> 48:36.710
when he comes into the world.

48:36.760 --> 48:38.440
Let me hold him, please?

48:39.600 --> 48:40.950
I need to hold him.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.760
I need to wrap him in another
blanket to keep him nice and warm.

48:53.120 --> 48:56.600
Don't hold him too tightly.
We have to let him breathe.

48:59.040 --> 49:02.400
Your little boy may need the help
of a specialist baby unit.

49:03.640 --> 49:06.560
I'll let Doctor know
and telephone for an ambulance.

49:16.360 --> 49:17.400
Reverend!

49:19.640 --> 49:20.680
Reverend!

49:23.400 --> 49:24.590
Reverend, please!

49:24.640 --> 49:27.510
You have to come. It's my baby!
Of course.

49:27.560 --> 49:28.710
Come on!

49:28.760 --> 49:31.150
The ambulance will be here
very soon

49:31.200 --> 49:33.360
and the hospital will do
everything that they can.

49:38.080 --> 49:39.190
Reverend Hereward?

49:39.240 --> 49:40.430
Nurse Franklin.

49:40.480 --> 49:42.760
I brought the priest,
Phoebe. How is he?

49:45.000 --> 49:47.120
They want to take him
to the hospital.

49:49.240 --> 49:50.480
But I can't let him go.

49:52.600 --> 49:53.720
Not yet, Reverend.

49:55.400 --> 49:56.830
Not yet.

49:56.880 --> 49:59.670
Would you like me
to christen your son, Mrs Doyle?

49:59.720 --> 50:01.390
Would you do that?

50:01.440 --> 50:03.160
With your permission, Nurse.

50:07.200 --> 50:10.760
You have a beautiful baby, Mrs
Doyle. Do you have a name for him?

50:13.000 --> 50:14.080
James Declan.

50:23.880 --> 50:24.920
James Declan...

50:26.120 --> 50:28.680
..I baptise thee in the name
of the Father...

50:31.480 --> 50:32.520
..and of the Son...

50:34.960 --> 50:36.280
..and of the Holy Ghost.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.080
Amen.

50:53.280 --> 50:56.830
We humbly beseech thee to grant,
that as he is now made partaker

50:56.880 --> 51:01.360
in the death of thy Son, that he
may be also of his resurrection.

51:02.360 --> 51:05.150
And finally,
with the residue of the Saints,

51:05.200 --> 51:08.470
that he may inherit thine
everlasting Kingdom,

51:08.520 --> 51:15.040
through the same, thy Son, Jesus
Christ, our Lord, Amen. Amen.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.320
The ambulance is here.

51:31.800 --> 51:35.270
I've made what enquiries I could at
the station about Nurse Mount.

51:35.320 --> 51:36.830
I... I dropped in at the London

51:36.880 --> 51:39.150
to see if she'd gone to see
Maurice Glennon.

51:39.200 --> 51:41.550
We must remember that
some of the most brusque amongst us

51:41.600 --> 51:43.470
are also the most kind-hearted.

51:43.520 --> 51:46.230
No accident involving
a nurse has been reported.

51:46.280 --> 51:49.950
She's very capable. I hope we're
all worrying about nothing.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.670
She has no right to make us
feel frantic like this.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.430
Honestly, I could give her a slap!

51:54.480 --> 51:56.750
Sister, please!

51:56.800 --> 51:58.510
Nurse Mount!

51:58.560 --> 51:59.670
Are you all right?

51:59.720 --> 52:00.790
Where've you been?

52:00.840 --> 52:03.350
I set off first thing for the
Hospital of Tropical Diseases

52:03.400 --> 52:05.750
at St Pancras.
And they told me there was

52:05.800 --> 52:08.190
a doctor who'd written
a paper on Strongyloidiasis.

52:08.240 --> 52:10.470
Didn't you think to tell anyone
where you'd gone?

52:10.520 --> 52:13.310
So I tracked him down
and he said there was a specialist

52:13.360 --> 52:16.350
trialling a new drug at the Liverpool
School of Tropical Disease.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.190
But because of the postal strike,
I thought

52:18.240 --> 52:20.950
I should go up there and get the
medication myself. To Liverpool?

52:21.000 --> 52:24.590
Fortunately I had my emergency
five pound note in my purse.

52:24.640 --> 52:27.950
The medication is American.
Dithiazanine.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.790
I need to get these to
Maurice Glennon.

52:29.840 --> 52:33.710
No, you do not. You need to rest
after the day you've had.

52:33.760 --> 52:35.550
I can take those.

52:35.600 --> 52:36.950
Thank you.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.190
What you need is a nice, long bath.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.880
I'll go and get that
sorted right away.

52:49.080 --> 52:50.110
Busy day?

52:50.160 --> 52:51.550
A landmark day!

52:51.600 --> 52:55.430
We are now completely up to date
with the polio vaccination
programme.

52:55.480 --> 52:57.520
That's wonderful, Patrick. Well done.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.870
Meanwhile, I haven't been
entirely idle.

53:02.920 --> 53:06.270
I called in at the
Church Of England Children's Society,

53:06.320 --> 53:08.830
asking about the possibility
of adoption.

53:08.880 --> 53:12.950
And?
And I was made extremely welcome!

53:13.000 --> 53:16.360
Tea in a china pot
and some very superior biscuits.

53:17.440 --> 53:22.430
I think they quite like the idea of
us - a GP and a retired midwife!

53:22.480 --> 53:25.270
As a first step, we have to fill
in all of these forms,

53:25.320 --> 53:28.630
then, if all's well,
we'll progress to interview.

53:28.680 --> 53:30.990
We'll be filling
these in for a week!

53:31.040 --> 53:32.870
Quite right, too.

53:32.920 --> 53:37.630
As the lady said, the children have
already got off to a sorry
start in life.

53:37.680 --> 53:41.950
They need the very best parents
the agency can find them.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.230
I don't know why they need to
know half of this stuff.

53:45.280 --> 53:47.910
I've never seen so many questions.

53:47.960 --> 53:49.390
Quite.

53:49.440 --> 53:52.480
No, I'm sorry, Shelagh.
You've rushed into this.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.710
There are plenty of
adoption charities

53:55.760 --> 53:57.470
and we should talk to them all,

53:57.520 --> 53:59.830
find out what conditions
they impose.

53:59.880 --> 54:02.430
No-one's imposing any conditions.

54:02.480 --> 54:04.150
They just want to know who we are.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.070
Well, it's perfectly
obvious who we are!

54:07.120 --> 54:10.120
Patrick, we're filling
these forms in tonight!

54:15.920 --> 54:18.430
Some babies are slow to take
the deep breaths they need.

54:18.480 --> 54:20.630
They have to be given oxygen
for a while.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.670
And is that all that's wrong
with the baby?

54:22.720 --> 54:25.710
Well, we have to hope there's
no serious cardiac problem.

54:25.760 --> 54:27.910
But quite often,
the problem sorts itself out.

54:27.960 --> 54:29.640
Really? How?

54:30.680 --> 54:35.040
Once a baby has to breathe on its
own, the heart can heal itself.

54:36.800 --> 54:39.030
And what about grown-ups?

54:39.080 --> 54:42.240
Can their hearts heal themselves,
too, Nurse Franklin?

54:43.560 --> 54:47.630
I think so. Trixie. Please.

54:47.680 --> 54:48.720
Tom.

54:50.480 --> 54:52.880
Very glad to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.

54:56.520 --> 54:57.560
Oh, look at that.

54:59.920 --> 55:00.960
The harvest moon.

55:08.360 --> 55:09.430
Am I forgiven?

55:09.480 --> 55:11.390
What on earth for?

55:11.440 --> 55:15.030
Everyone's being awfully
careful around me all of a sudden.

55:15.080 --> 55:18.990
Well, the last time I saw you,
you were rather angry with me.

55:19.040 --> 55:20.750
Only cos you were right.

55:20.800 --> 55:24.960
There's nothing worse than having an
argument with someone who's right.

55:26.640 --> 55:29.400
I think it's time for an Advocaat.
Don't you?

55:50.400 --> 55:54.270
For you. It's a
harvest festival parcel.

55:54.320 --> 55:57.790
We need to build you up
and get you back to work.

55:57.840 --> 55:59.240
You've given me enough.

56:02.520 --> 56:05.120
One of the nuns came. Big woman.

56:09.440 --> 56:12.710
She told me
what happened to you as a girl.

56:12.760 --> 56:15.430
I didn't suffer any more than you.

56:15.480 --> 56:18.160
Don't let it eat you up
for the rest of your life.

56:20.720 --> 56:24.320
Remember what I said.
Next time there's a storm...

56:26.120 --> 56:28.080
..you need to leave open both doors.

56:33.280 --> 56:35.560
Don't let your misfortunes
find a home.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.800
'History needn't be a trap.

56:42.320 --> 56:46.840
'We can escape its web
and shake off its weight of pain.

56:50.520 --> 56:53.390
'We can change our minds

56:53.440 --> 56:55.120
'and open up our hearts.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.400

and sustain us all our days.'
