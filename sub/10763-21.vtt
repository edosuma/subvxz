WEBVTT

00:09.309 --> 00:11.311
May I get my usual, please?

00:11.311 --> 00:13.013
Well, you're
in a good mood.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.014
What's up?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.015
Well, actually...

00:15.015 --> 00:17.317
No, I better not.
Don't want to jinx it.

00:17.317 --> 00:18.306
No problem.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.021
Besides, the mark of a true
gentleman is discretion.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.322
Okay.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.324
Listen, about your dad's
bachelor party...

00:24.324 --> 00:27.027
Charlotte and I spent
the night together.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.729
I thought she was seeing
that super-hotty Frank.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.219
Dumped him,
thank you.

00:32.732 --> 00:33.666
For you?

00:33.666 --> 00:35.668
I mean, wow!
Way to go!

00:35.668 --> 00:36.669
Yes, I know.

00:36.669 --> 00:38.171
It's funny I should end up

00:38.171 --> 00:39.160
with my own matchmaker,
isn't it?

00:39.606 --> 00:42.541
Yeah. I mean, that Frank
was the whole package.

00:43.143 --> 00:44.444
Those eyes,

00:44.444 --> 00:46.613
that chin,
that bod that wouldn't quit.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.082
Yes, well, it didn't have
to quit; it was fired.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.071
Uh, thank you
very much.

00:50.583 --> 00:51.584
Now, you were
saying something

00:51.584 --> 00:53.086
about my dad's
bachelor party?

00:53.086 --> 00:54.587
Yeah. Weren't you
having a problem

00:54.587 --> 00:55.576
deciding on
the entertainment?

00:56.089 --> 00:57.090
Oh, yes.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.592
Well, there's this girl
in my spin class,

00:59.592 --> 01:02.595
and she does it all--
strips, lap dances, movies.

01:02.595 --> 01:03.596
Really?

01:03.596 --> 01:05.098
Would I be familiar
with her work?

01:05.098 --> 01:07.532
I don't know.
Have you seenGrinding Nemo?

01:09.436 --> 01:11.438
Anyway, I invited her over here
so you could check her out.

01:11.438 --> 01:12.405
She's going to be here
any second.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.107
Her name is Amber Licious.

01:14.107 --> 01:15.408
Really? Well...

01:15.408 --> 01:17.110
I'm afraid I can't d
o it right now.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.812
I'm meeting Charlotte
for coffee. Uh...

01:18.812 --> 01:19.801
You can tell her yourself.

01:20.213 --> 01:21.781
Hey, Amber.

01:21.781 --> 01:22.782
Hi, Roz.
How are you?

01:22.782 --> 01:23.783
This is Frasier.

01:23.783 --> 01:25.285
Hello.

01:25.285 --> 01:27.554
Hello. Uh, how do you
do, Miss Licious? Uh...

01:27.554 --> 01:29.823
Um, I'm terribly sorry, but,

01:29.823 --> 01:31.313
uh, I've got something scheduled

01:31.825 --> 01:33.326
so I'll have
to postpone our interview.

01:33.326 --> 01:34.816
Perhaps we could meet,
uh, this evening

01:35.328 --> 01:36.329
at my place, around 7:00?

01:36.329 --> 01:37.764
I live at the Elliot Bay Towers.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.332
Can we make it 7:30?

01:39.332 --> 01:42.802
I have to go redub some groans
for He Biscuit.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.637
Well, I'll see
you then. Great.

01:44.637 --> 01:47.640
Frasier?
Hmm? Oh, uh...

01:47.640 --> 01:49.142
Oh, hi.
Listen, I...

01:49.142 --> 01:50.643
Gosh, I'm sorry I had to
dash off this morning.

01:50.643 --> 01:51.644
No, it's okay.

01:51.644 --> 01:53.146
I have to dash off
myself right now.

01:53.146 --> 01:54.647
Oh, I thought
we were having coffee.

01:54.647 --> 01:55.648
We were. I forgot,

01:55.648 --> 01:57.650
I have to catch a train
to Portland in 20 minutes.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.152
I'm giving a talk

01:59.152 --> 02:01.154
to the Northwest Businesswoman'?
Association. I'm sorry.

02:01.154 --> 02:02.655
Oh, no, it's all right.

02:02.655 --> 02:03.644
I'm sure you'll be wonderful
.

02:04.157 --> 02:05.158
Yeah. It's a good speech.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.659
I gave it last year

02:06.659 --> 02:08.149
to the Midwest
Businesswoman's Association.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.163
Anyway, I'll be
back Sunday night.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.664
We can have
dinner then.

02:11.664 --> 02:13.666
I-I really
should catch a cab.

02:13.666 --> 02:16.328
Maybe I could just
drive you to the station.

02:16.669 --> 02:17.170
Oh, you don't
have to do that.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.671
No, no. I'd like to.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.173
Besides, I've always
been a sucker

02:20.173 --> 02:22.175
for that romantic,
movie-ending good-bye--

02:22.175 --> 02:25.678
a fog-shrouded train platform,
a-a passionate kiss.

02:25.678 --> 02:27.180
With a romantic dip.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.181
Yes, well,

02:28.181 --> 02:30.683
maybe I am, but there are
damn few of us left.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.185
Dip, dip, dip...

02:32.185 --> 02:33.675
Oh.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.554
So, I could make us
a reservation for dinner
on Sunday.

02:38.925 --> 02:42.462
I would suggest Cucina.
Yeah, okay.

02:42.462 --> 02:45.331
Charlotte, you seem
a little distracted.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.333
Is there something on your mind?

02:47.333 --> 02:49.836
Charlotte?

02:49.836 --> 02:50.825
Oh, Frasier.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.338
Oh, boy.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.329
I-I really don't want
to get into this now.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.310
Why don't we talk about it
Sunday night?

02:57.310 --> 02:59.646
Please, I can't
wait till Sunday.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.514
My imagination
will torture me.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.947
Okay.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.353
I'm moving back
to Chicago in three weeks.

03:07.353 --> 03:07.819
Three weeks?

03:08.321 --> 03:09.253
It's not you.

03:09.289 --> 03:12.859
I bought my old business back
from my ex. I...

03:12.859 --> 03:15.328
I know I should have
told you sooner,

03:15.328 --> 03:16.761
but it was never
the right time.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.530
Are you okay?

03:21.234 --> 03:23.202
(softly) :
I had to blab to Roz.

03:23.836 --> 03:24.837
What?

03:24.837 --> 03:26.339
Nothing.

03:26.339 --> 03:27.829
Are you sure?

03:29.342 --> 03:31.708
This all happened
before we got together.

03:31.978 --> 03:35.548
Well, let's look
on the bright side.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.417
I mean, Chicago
isn't that far away.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.386
I don't want
a long-distance relationship,

03:40.386 --> 03:41.688
and neither do you.

03:41.688 --> 03:44.390
You said so
on your application.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.692
Okay.
But you know,

03:45.692 --> 03:48.528
we still have,
uh, three weeks.

03:48.528 --> 03:49.963
Don't be hurt, but...

03:49.963 --> 03:53.399
if someone called your show
and said,

03:53.399 --> 03:54.400
"I'm leaving town
in three weeks.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.902
Should I get involved
with someone?"

03:55.902 --> 03:57.301
What would you say?

03:58.738 --> 04:01.474
I'd say it was foolish
to take the plunge

04:01.474 --> 04:03.409
and bring up feelings
that must be dashed,

04:03.409 --> 04:06.346
and so forth.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.480
But what do I know?

04:07.480 --> 04:08.777
.
I'm not infallible

04:09.415 --> 04:11.315
Frasier...

04:12.552 --> 04:13.917
All right.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.625
Son of a bitch!

04:19.625 --> 04:21.327
Ooh, I'm sorry
. My hand slipped.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.629
No, no. It's my train.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.630
Damn it!

04:23.630 --> 04:24.619
Oh, dear.
All right, look,

04:25.331 --> 04:26.633
Uh, the next station
isn't too far.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.567
I-I bet I can
beat the train.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.470
(train whistle blowing)

04:32.939 --> 04:37.443
Well, round two
to Amtrak.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.912
I could drive us
to the next station.

04:39.912 --> 04:41.347
Okay, but you do know

04:41.347 --> 04:44.373
you're going
to have to drive
a little faster.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.587
You do realize
we got passed by a school bus

04:47.587 --> 04:49.282
and a prefab home?

04:49.522 --> 04:51.990
Point taken.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.794
I really do
appreciate this.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.489
.
Oh, it's all right

04:56.596 --> 04:58.364
o.
Didn't have anything else to d

04:58.364 --> 04:59.353
Oh, dear.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.503
I've got t
o make a call.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.405
Could you hold
the wheel, please?

05:05.405 --> 05:07.473
I just, uh, got this.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.476
It's a... it's a...
a hands-free unit.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.465
Much, uh, much, much safer.

05:14.347 --> 05:15.815
Can we just meet her?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.806
Everyone in Frasier's building
raves about her,

05:18.518 --> 05:19.519
and I hear she's unhappy.

05:19.519 --> 05:20.508
I just hate the idea

05:20.820 --> 05:22.481
of poaching the
Steingarden's nanny.

05:22.722 --> 05:23.656
I seem to recall

05:23.656 --> 05:25.351
you poaching another man's
fiance' once.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.354
Oh, Daphne, I was in college.
I...

05:28.561 --> 05:30.330
Oh, you mean...

05:30.330 --> 05:31.631
(phone rings)

05:31.631 --> 05:32.620
Well, who did you mean?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.634
Sorry. I have
to get this.

05:34.634 --> 05:35.623
Hello.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.003
Niles.
Frasier.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.870
Listen, you remember
that idea we proposed

05:40.373 --> 05:41.374
about Dad's party?

05:41.374 --> 05:43.740
The, uh, the
entertainer? Oh.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.501
The klezmer band?

05:46.679 --> 05:48.748
No, no. The stripper.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.340
Uh, well, I found one.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.042
Daphne's fine,
thank you for asking.

05:52.518 --> 05:53.883
She's right he
re beside me.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.522
Niles, I'm supposed
to interview her

05:56.522 --> 05:57.511
this evening at 7:30
at my place.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.525
I can't make it.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.427
Something came up.
You'll have to do it for me.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.895
Oh, no, thank you.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.665
Niles, if you're worried
about Dad being there.

06:05.665 --> 06:06.654
He's got a date
with Ronee tonight.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.602
(laughs)

06:09.602 --> 06:10.694
Don't we want south?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.373
Listen, Niles,
I-I know that you get nervous

06:13.373 --> 06:16.376
around fan dancers
and their ilk,

06:16.376 --> 06:18.037
but you have got
to conquer your fear.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.106
Thank you. I'll talk to you later.
Good-bye.

06:20.513 --> 06:21.581
South.

06:21.581 --> 06:22.582
What? I'm sorry?

06:22.582 --> 06:23.583
South! South!

06:23.583 --> 06:24.584
What? What?

06:24.584 --> 06:26.085
South!

06:26.085 --> 06:27.553
Oh, dear, uh...

06:27.553 --> 06:29.122
You know, perhaps
it would be best

06:29.122 --> 06:31.113
if you just said
left or right.

06:31.624 --> 06:32.613
It's not like there's
a compass in the car.

06:32.992 --> 06:34.560
What's that?

06:34.560 --> 06:37.051
.
Oh, well,
I'll be damned

06:37.563 --> 06:38.564
What's that red light?

06:38.564 --> 06:39.565
Hmm. Oh, that.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.067
Oh, that's nothing
to worry about.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.535
It's been
on for months.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.060
I think there'
s something wrong
with the bulb.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.714
Cell phones
don't work here.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.048
Please tell me

06:56.048 --> 06:57.550
you know what's wrong
with the car.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.541
Not a clue.

07:00.052 --> 07:01.542
I opened the hood
as a mere formality.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.549
(knocking)

07:10.496 --> 07:11.998
Hello?

07:11.998 --> 07:13.966
Uh, we're terribly sorry
to bother you,

07:13.966 --> 07:16.436
but our car has broken down.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.427
Well, come on in
out of that cold.

07:18.538 --> 07:22.575
My husband knows
everything about cars.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.476
Harbin, these people's
car broke down.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.576
Go take a look at it
for them.

07:27.847 --> 07:28.541
Harbin!

07:28.815 --> 07:30.840
(mumbling)

07:31.551 --> 07:33.553
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.852
We certainly
appreciate that.

07:37.557 --> 07:38.546
Have a seat and have
a cup of coffee

07:38.858 --> 07:39.859
and warm up.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.561
I'm Sue, by the way.

07:41.561 --> 07:42.862
Thank you.
You're very kind.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.564
Yes, yes, indeed.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.566
I'm Charlotte.
And I'm Frasier.

07:46.566 --> 07:50.570
Gosh, you seem to be preparing
for some sort of a party.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.231
Well, Harbin's mother
passed away,

07:52.605 --> 07:54.937
so people will be coming
over tomorrow.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.938
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

07:57.610 --> 07:58.911
We should get
out of your hair.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.613
Oh, no, please!
The company will do us good.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.911
Harbin really perked up
when you came in.

08:04.617 --> 08:05.518
Really?

08:05.518 --> 08:08.578
Because he seems
to be crying in our car.

08:10.122 --> 08:12.124
Excuse me.

08:12.124 --> 08:13.593
Harbin!

08:13.593 --> 08:16.562
For goodness sake,
pop the hood!

08:19.499 --> 08:20.193
You will have to excuse him.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.659
He was very attached
to his mother.

08:22.768 --> 08:25.771
A little too attached
for my taste.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.763
Hi, baby.

08:29.075 --> 08:30.542
Who are these?

08:31.978 --> 08:33.712
Their car broke down.

08:33.712 --> 08:34.202
This is my son
Jonathan.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.215
Isn't he handsome?

08:36.215 --> 08:39.719
Jonathan, this is
Frasier and Charlotte.

08:39.719 --> 08:40.720
How do you do?

08:40.720 --> 08:41.708
Yes, nice
to meet you.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.158
How is your project
today, baby?

08:46.158 --> 08:48.160
Fine, Mother.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.060
You want a butterscotch?

08:50.263 --> 08:53.323
.
No, I'm
good. I'm good

08:54.800 --> 08:56.736
So what are
you making?

08:56.736 --> 08:59.705
Art.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.941
He won't let any of us see it
till it's finished.

09:01.941 --> 09:05.638
Oh. So, how's our car?

09:05.945 --> 09:07.640
Can we just scoot
right away from here?

09:07.813 --> 09:08.848
No, I'll have to...

09:08.848 --> 09:11.551
drive to town tomorrow
for the parts.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.540
What happened?

09:12.818 --> 09:15.855
Well, we were just driving
along the highway

09:15.855 --> 09:17.755
and suddenly the engine
just died.

09:17.957 --> 09:20.016
(sobbing) :
Excuse me.

09:24.864 --> 09:26.559
Excuseme.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.570
Will you please
cut out the hangdog bit,

09:30.570 --> 09:31.871
Mr. Welcome Wagon?

09:31.871 --> 09:33.873
We got company!

09:33.873 --> 09:35.308
Get in there,
show 'em some manners.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.299
Offer them a place
to stay for the night.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.278
You're not gonna
like it here.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.184
Of course, of course,

09:45.184 --> 09:46.173
you'll have
to spend the night.

09:46.686 --> 09:47.753
We couldn't.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.689
No, we really,
really couldn't.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.691
There must be a hotel
in town.

09:51.691 --> 09:54.694
What does this look like,
Lancaster?

09:54.694 --> 09:55.683
(laughing)

09:57.964 --> 09:58.658
It's no problem.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.798
You could bunk
with Jonathan,

10:01.267 --> 10:03.269
and Charlotte,
you could have
the fold-out.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.637
I'll help make up your bed.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.036
No, it's okay.

10:06.739 --> 10:07.740
We'll stay together.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.041
Yes, that's right,
together.

10:09.041 --> 10:09.905
Well, are you married?

10:10.343 --> 10:13.779
Because we don't want
to set a bad example.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.707
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, married. We're married.

10:15.881 --> 10:16.677
For how long?

10:16.849 --> 10:19.374
Two months
.
Oh, two years.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.778
Hey, Ronee, it's me.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.815
Uh, I got to interview
a new physical therapist

10:27.126 --> 10:29.651
to fill in for Daph, so pick
me up 1 5 minutes later, okay?

10:29.996 --> 10:32.365
Well, just have a drink.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.799
Well, have another one!

10:36.669 --> 10:38.704
Really?

10:38.704 --> 10:40.672
Maybe I'll pickyouup.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.210
Frasier?

10:44.210 --> 10:46.712
You're too busy
to answer the phone.

10:46.712 --> 10:49.015
But I'm just about
to interview this stripper,

10:49.015 --> 10:50.778
and I have no idea what to ask.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.820
I just hope Dad doesn't walk i
and spoil the surprise.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.123
I'm already developing some sort

10:57.123 --> 11:01.719
of aversion-based mouth dryness
as we speak.

11:02.028 --> 11:03.723
This is Niles, by the way.

11:07.199 --> 11:08.167
Hey, Niles.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.225
Oh!

11:11.170 --> 11:12.228
What's up?

11:12.838 --> 11:15.841
Frasier is going to split
a case of oloroso with me,

11:15.841 --> 11:17.843
because we both like oloroso.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.779
.
But he's not here,
so I'll stop bothering you

11:19.779 --> 11:21.076
Nice chatting.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.717
Oh! Oh!

11:24.717 --> 11:26.719
Are you-you here
for the interview?

11:26.719 --> 11:28.721
Yes.
Crane, right?

11:28.721 --> 11:29.881
Uh, yes, yes.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.191
But, um...
uh... the place is a mess.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.751
Do you mind if we...
if we talk in the lobby?

11:34.894 --> 11:36.361
I guess that's okay.

11:36.762 --> 11:37.160
(whispers):
Wonderful.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:46.872 --> 11:48.174
Uh, so...

11:48.174 --> 11:49.875
(clears throat)

11:49.875 --> 11:52.178
How-how long have you
been doing what you do?

11:52.178 --> 11:53.879
Oh, years now.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.182
At first I just did it
for friends, but then I thought,

11:56.182 --> 11:58.173
"Why am I giving this away
when I can make money at it?"

12:00.186 --> 12:02.188
Here are my references.

12:02.188 --> 12:05.191
Oh! I didn't know you
people had references.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.226
Let alone...

12:07.226 --> 12:08.728
The mayor?!

12:08.728 --> 12:09.854
Yeah.

12:10.362 --> 12:11.852
I started with him,

12:12.364 --> 12:14.855
and now I do
most of the city council.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.369
Uh, well, uh, that's-that'
s good enough for me.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.271
You're hired.

12:19.271 --> 12:21.136
Shouldn't your dad meet
me before you decide?

12:21.507 --> 12:23.743
Oh, no, no.
We don't want him to see you

12:23.743 --> 12:25.404
till you're taking off
your clothes.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.213
What are you talking about?

12:27.213 --> 12:29.181
And why are you sweating
so much?

12:29.181 --> 12:30.876
.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

12:31.150 --> 12:34.142
I'm just, I'm just a little ill at ease
around, you know...

12:34.854 --> 12:36.151
What?

12:38.858 --> 12:40.960
Sex workers!

12:40.960 --> 12:42.757
Ew!

12:43.062 --> 12:44.825
Get away from me, you freak!

12:47.867 --> 12:48.856
Hi.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.271
Hi.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.468
What are you doing here,
and why are you so sweaty?

12:55.841 --> 12:59.937
I was talking to Dad
about my case of oloroso.

13:00.212 --> 13:01.947
Oh, well, if it doesn't clear
by tomorrow,

13:01.947 --> 13:02.971
you should call a doctor.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.283
I will.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.985
Oh!

13:05.985 --> 13:07.286
Hello, Kathy!

13:07.286 --> 13:08.988
Yeah, it's Daphne Crane.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.990
Listen I'm going to be
over here in 1 901,

13:10.990 --> 13:12.958
and I was wondering
if we could finally meet.

13:13.025 --> 13:13.821
Oh, that's wonderful!

13:14.126 --> 13:15.828
Don't even call it an interview.

13:15.828 --> 13:18.097
Everyone says you're
the best nanny in Seattle.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.894
Good. I'll see you
up there, then.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.871
Oh, wow, that was fast.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.173
Come on in.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.868
All right.
What happened
to Dr. Crane?

13:29.175 --> 13:30.870
Oh, he's not feeling well.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.166
Thanks for coming.

13:32.878 --> 13:33.173
I know you're busy.

13:33.879 --> 13:34.880
Please, have a seat.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.182
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, right after this,

13:36.182 --> 13:37.183
I have to go pick
up a new teddy.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.885
Oh! That's so sweet!

13:39.885 --> 13:42.054
(both giggling)

13:42.054 --> 13:44.420
Well, I'll make this
quick, then.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.859
We're not expecting
anything fancy.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.350
Just the basic burping,
diapering and so forth.

13:49.895 --> 13:52.264
Okay, I guess
I'm game for that.

13:52.264 --> 13:53.959
Oh, wonderful!

13:54.066 --> 13:56.135
Why don't I make us some tea,
and we can talk?

13:56.135 --> 13:59.138
Great! Uh, did you want me
to wear something special?

13:59.138 --> 14:01.038
Oh! Since you ask,

14:01.473 --> 14:03.941
.
I've always been partial to
a simple white nurse's uniform

14:04.109 --> 14:05.667
It's a classic.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.307
Oh, hi! I thought I heard
some talking out here.

14:13.018 --> 14:13.313
I'm Marty Crane.
Hi.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.321
How you doing?
Great.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.989
Yeah. So, Daphne give
you the third degree?

14:16.989 --> 14:18.547
Oh, not really.
No? Well, that's good.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.460
I think she's a little
sensitive, you know,

14:21.460 --> 14:22.962
about being replaced.

14:22.962 --> 14:25.021
She's been doing me
for ten years.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.927
Oh! But then
she got pregnant.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.565
Right, right.

14:28.968 --> 14:32.037
But you know, lately she's bee
having me up on the table.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.039
I like it better on the floor.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.336
The floor all right with you?

14:35.975 --> 14:37.042
It's your dime.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.100
Great, great.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.004
Well, uh, maybe you
could show me your stuff.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.948
Oh...
I'll never hear
the end of it

14:42.948 --> 14:44.882
if I don't take you out for a spin.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.542
Oh, sure.
I just need to change.

14:47.019 --> 14:47.917
.
Oh, yeah. The powder
room's right there

14:48.420 --> 14:48.909
Here? Okay.

14:55.060 --> 14:55.458
Where did she go?

14:55.961 --> 14:57.963
You didn't drive
her off, did you?

14:57.963 --> 14:58.952
No, not at all.
I like her.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.454
What do you think
about her?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.268
I like her a lot.
Good!

15:02.268 --> 15:04.361
'Course we won't really know
till we see her in action.

15:04.703 --> 15:07.263
Ta-dah!

15:09.208 --> 15:10.903
You're hired!

15:18.017 --> 15:19.218
CHARLO TTE:
Hi, sweetie!
Hi.

15:19.218 --> 15:21.049
Gone for 20 minutes?
Yes.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.390
Well, uh, Harbin was just giving
me a tour of my engine...

15:24.390 --> 15:26.051
Uh...

15:26.191 --> 15:28.193
You've got either a blown
rod bearing or a loose pin.

15:28.193 --> 15:30.559
We had a stethoscope, I'm sure
we could tell the difference.

15:31.030 --> 15:31.655
Oh, yes, well,
you know,

15:32.197 --> 15:33.632
I'm so hopeless
with cars.

15:33.632 --> 15:35.501
I know I would
just misdiagnose it.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.503
Wouldn't be the
first misdiagnosis

15:37.503 --> 15:38.993
that ever happened.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.998
Friend Charlotte...

15:46.011 --> 15:47.239
Excuse me?

15:47.579 --> 15:49.581
I thought most married
women wore a ring,

15:49.581 --> 15:51.572
yet your hand is
bare and white.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.076
Yes, i-it is.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.590
Um...

15:58.590 --> 16:00.080
that's because this
is the hand that I...

16:00.526 --> 16:04.063
fell in love with...

16:04.063 --> 16:06.065
a hand too...
too perfect

16:06.065 --> 16:07.366
for, uh...

16:07.366 --> 16:09.068
the profanity of gold

16:09.068 --> 16:12.071
or-or platinum.

16:12.071 --> 16:16.337
After all, what diamond
could possibly rival the...

16:16.775 --> 16:18.470
sparkle in those eyes?

16:18.777 --> 16:22.338
I'll take my coffee
in the living room,
you don't mind!

16:24.683 --> 16:28.187
If that will make you
happy, Harbin.

16:28.187 --> 16:30.121
Shall we?

16:41.166 --> 16:43.157
This is Grandma.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.367
We... had no idea.

16:48.607 --> 16:51.110
We are having the wake
here tomorrow.

16:51.110 --> 16:54.102
(sobbing):
Mama loved to party.

16:57.049 --> 16:58.539
Excuse me again.

17:01.553 --> 17:04.044
SUE:
Yeah, she loved to party,
all right,

17:04.556 --> 17:07.559
with me as her personal slave
and handmaiden,

17:07.559 --> 17:10.084
doing all the cooking
and the cleaning

17:10.462 --> 17:12.364
and the wiping her sorry...

17:12.364 --> 17:14.388
Sugar?

17:16.068 --> 17:18.369
You know,
we're a bit tired, really.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.065
Maybe we could
just turn in?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.067
Well, help me get the cushions
off the fold-up.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.363
We'll make up the bed.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.069
You mean, we're-we'r
e sleeping in here?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.075
.
Well, there's Mama's bed

17:32.051 --> 17:34.042
But that's in our room.

17:40.759 --> 17:43.250
e.
This'll be fin

17:48.200 --> 17:50.202
(machine humming)

17:50.202 --> 17:51.066
Did you hear that?

17:51.236 --> 17:52.168
What?

17:52.671 --> 17:53.439
(buzzing)

17:53.439 --> 17:55.140
That!

17:55.140 --> 17:56.442
What do you think
he's doing down there?

17:56.442 --> 17:58.243
Well, how should I know?
He's your friend.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.745
Shh!

17:59.745 --> 18:01.246
(chuckling)

18:01.246 --> 18:03.680
(footsteps)

18:20.099 --> 18:22.260
Grandma?

18:24.269 --> 18:25.463
It's Jonathan.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.208
I just wanted
to tell you

18:29.208 --> 18:33.167
that our little secret
is still safe.

18:45.657 --> 18:49.115
Well, this tops anything
that would have happened
at the Portland Radisson.

18:52.498 --> 18:54.466
(chuckles)

18:54.466 --> 18:55.330
(footsteps)

19:07.279 --> 19:09.213
(voice breaking) :
Hi, Mama!

19:11.283 --> 19:16.655
I can't believe I'm not
going to get one more hug.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.525
What's that?

19:19.525 --> 19:22.294
One more?

19:22.294 --> 19:23.283
Oh!

19:25.497 --> 19:27.192
Oh! Oh!

19:37.709 --> 19:40.646
I better go, Mama.

19:40.646 --> 19:44.309
I'm sorry I scraped your head with my watch.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.864
You know...

19:58.864 --> 20:01.733
he said the same thing
to my engine

20:01.733 --> 20:03.235
when he opened the hood.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.226
(chuckling)

20:09.241 --> 20:11.232
(sighs)

20:14.413 --> 20:17.382
Charlotte...

20:17.382 --> 20:19.384
I'm afraid we're making
a terrible mistake.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.988
Frasier, I'm not
switching sides again.

20:22.988 --> 20:24.823
No.

20:24.823 --> 20:27.259
I mean, writing off
these three weeks

20:27.259 --> 20:28.560
just 'cause you're moving.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.562
I had a great time
with you today.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.432
And with somebody else,
it would have been a disaster.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.367
With somebody else,

20:35.367 --> 20:37.369
I would have
been in Portland.

20:37.369 --> 20:40.339
Come on. You know
what I'm talking about.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.274
We have a lot of fun together.

20:42.274 --> 20:45.402
And why deny ourselves
the chance to have even more?

20:45.911 --> 20:49.711
I know the sensible thing
would be to just end it now

20:50.015 --> 20:51.450
and walk away.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.418
And normally,
that's what I would do.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.920
But...

20:54.920 --> 20:57.356
I don't want to be sensible.

20:57.356 --> 21:00.359
But we'd only
have three weeks.

21:00.359 --> 21:03.462
I know.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.631
It'd be like a summer fling.

21:05.631 --> 21:08.361
But wouldn't we be
sad when it ended?

21:08.900 --> 21:12.404
Of course we would.

21:12.404 --> 21:13.530
That's what happens.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.536
You-you're sad
when summer's over.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.010
Well, I... never was.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.413
I mean, I always looked forward
to the new school year.

21:22.714 --> 21:24.341
I would buy my books
a month...

21:24.583 --> 21:27.575
Are you going to
talk all summer?

21:28.305 --> 21:34.384
