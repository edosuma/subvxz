WEBVTT

00:06.250 --> 00:08.250
[cat meowing]

00:10.250 --> 00:12.416
[siren wailing]

00:16.750 --> 00:18.333
I'm looking for a little pussy.

00:19.041 --> 00:23.000
And I hate to be this guy,
but it's a very specific pussycat I need.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.458
And this is the fifth place I've tried
and, fuck me,

00:25.458 --> 00:26.791
are you a sight for sore eyes

00:26.791 --> 00:29.375
after the ogres
I've been dealing with all morning.

00:29.375 --> 00:31.208
I need a black cat. Female.

00:31.750 --> 00:32.833
About yay big.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.708
Please tell me you can handle that.

00:37.666 --> 00:41.041
[chuckles] Cutie.
I can handle that just fine.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.083
- [cats meowing]
- How about this little guy?

00:44.083 --> 00:46.500
Short-timer.
Scheduled to leave us tonight.

00:47.208 --> 00:49.125
That reeks of euphemism, my lady.

00:49.125 --> 00:51.875
Oh, well, our guests get one week
to find a home.

00:52.583 --> 00:54.125
This isn't a no-kill shelter.

00:54.875 --> 00:57.583
I have a soft spot for the short-timers.
Always have.

00:57.583 --> 00:58.666
[sighs]

00:58.666 --> 01:00.500
All black. It's gotta be black.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.250
What about these two?
Not black, but siblings.

01:03.250 --> 01:06.000
I'd ask you take them both though,
keep them together.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.833
Important with siblings, really,
you keep them together.

01:10.833 --> 01:11.833
What about that one?

01:13.791 --> 01:14.875
No, not available.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.041
That's a purebred British short-hair.

01:17.041 --> 01:19.625
We've already had four applications
for her online.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.916
But there are some really lovely cats

01:22.916 --> 01:25.333
who won't make it
if someone doesn't intervene.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.583
Fucking uncanny, innit?

01:28.583 --> 01:29.958
[meows]

01:30.958 --> 01:32.791
Like I said, she isn't available.

01:32.791 --> 01:35.708
Yeah. Um, I don't think
you know what I am.

01:36.833 --> 01:37.875
I'm a money bomb.

01:37.875 --> 01:40.625
New cages. New computer. New building.

01:40.625 --> 01:44.375
I will adopt every cat in here
and donate it to an orphanage.

01:44.375 --> 01:49.541
Set you up waterside in a new facility
with tiny little kitty hot tubs.

01:49.541 --> 01:50.625
They'd hate that.

01:50.625 --> 01:53.541
And dress you head to toe
in Louis Vuitton if I have to.

01:54.791 --> 01:56.875
But I'm walking out of here with this cat.

01:56.875 --> 01:57.875
[meows]

01:59.208 --> 02:00.333
God, that's uncanny.

02:01.791 --> 02:04.000
Uh... [sighs] Let me, uh...

02:06.000 --> 02:08.750
Look, can you just, uh...
Yeah, just hold it like that.

02:09.583 --> 02:11.833
- Yeah. Just like that.
- [clears throat]

02:11.833 --> 02:13.250
[chuckles]

02:13.250 --> 02:14.875
- [camera shutter clicks]
- [meowing]

02:19.958 --> 02:21.666
You little fucker, you saved my life.

02:22.791 --> 02:23.916
- [meows]
- [door opens]

02:23.916 --> 02:28.083
Hey, guess who I found
just hanging outside the front door.

02:29.166 --> 02:30.041
Bad news, though,

02:30.041 --> 02:32.250
looks like someone nicked
the Gucci collar.

02:32.791 --> 02:34.625
- [meows]
- Oh, sorry.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.625
I guess Daddy's out getting
a latte or something.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.958
- [cat growls, hisses]
- [yelps]

02:38.958 --> 02:40.041
Little cunt!

02:40.041 --> 02:42.125
- [cell phone ringing]
- [exhales]

02:47.000 --> 02:48.500
Hey, Dad, I'm kind of busy.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.166
The fuck you say?

02:56.708 --> 02:57.708
Say that again.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.333
No.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.583
[scoffs] No, that's bollocks.

03:06.583 --> 03:07.583
No, she's not.

03:08.625 --> 03:09.625
Nah.

03:10.666 --> 03:11.583
[Roderick] <i>Denial.</i>

03:11.583 --> 03:12.500
[phone clatters]

03:12.500 --> 03:13.666
[inhales]

03:14.375 --> 03:17.041
[Roderick] It's amazing how far
you can get on denial.

03:17.041 --> 03:18.208
[cell phone vibrates]

03:19.125 --> 03:21.583
You know why so many people
use denial to get by?

03:23.625 --> 03:25.291
Because it really fucking works.

03:26.125 --> 03:29.625
Your granddaughter again? This late.
You want to take it? She okay?

03:29.625 --> 03:30.958
She's fine.

03:30.958 --> 03:34.708
The thing about denial is sometimes
problems do just go away on their own,

03:34.708 --> 03:36.708
so it makes it feel like denial works.

03:37.625 --> 03:38.791
The placebo effect.

03:38.791 --> 03:40.791
[thudding]

03:45.333 --> 03:46.875
[Roderick] It's just Madeline.

03:47.458 --> 03:48.916
What's she doing down there?

03:48.916 --> 03:51.541
Tinkering with her gigabyte or some such.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.791
She's a genius. A real one.

03:53.791 --> 03:57.375
I mean, like, four or five people
in a century genius.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.708
She quit Mensa because she was bored.

03:59.708 --> 04:02.125
Maybe we should fold her
into the conversation,

04:02.125 --> 04:03.875
throw a little genius in the mix.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.750
Where were we? Yeah. Denial.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.875
Sometimes it works, like I said.

04:11.875 --> 04:14.583
But other times, it doesn't.

04:16.583 --> 04:20.125
It really fucking doesn't.

04:20.916 --> 04:22.291
[Leo] <i>I don't believe this.</i>

04:22.916 --> 04:25.500
- This is fucking off!
- We're still looking into it.

04:25.500 --> 04:28.458
Well, what was she doing there
to begin with? Vic?

04:29.041 --> 04:31.250
- What?
- This is your lab. Your animals.

04:31.250 --> 04:33.541
I don't know. I didn't send her there.

04:33.541 --> 04:37.625
Maybe, hmm? Maybe the $50 million-bounty
had something to do with it?

04:37.625 --> 04:39.583
[Leo] What the fuck you been doing?

04:39.583 --> 04:43.208
- Your little cyborg murder monkeys?
- You're not putting this on me.

04:43.208 --> 04:46.041
My wife is in the ICU.
She's maimed. Maimed.

04:46.041 --> 04:48.291
[Tammy] What are we even
talking about here?

04:48.291 --> 04:51.375
There is the trial! I have to launch.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.083
Sit down!

04:54.375 --> 04:57.583
Be angry, be shocked, yell, whatever.
Do it in here.

04:57.583 --> 05:00.916
This is the space I've allowed for it,
but when we go outside,

05:00.916 --> 05:04.208
someone needs to make
a statement to the press.

05:04.208 --> 05:05.708
We think it should be Leo.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.166
Of course you think it should be Leo.

05:10.750 --> 05:13.416
This is just awful. I'm so sorry.
Camille was such a--

05:13.416 --> 05:16.666
Why is it talking? It really,
it shouldn't be talking right now.

05:16.666 --> 05:19.666
She just said she's sorry.
How do you expect her to feel?

05:19.666 --> 05:22.166
This is a crisis,
we need to mitigate the damage.

05:22.166 --> 05:25.333
I'm saying that is why we had Camille.
This was her thing.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.958
[Leo] "On behalf of myself
and the Usher family,

05:27.958 --> 05:32.791
I'm saddened to announce the loss
of our beloved Camille L'Espanaye..."

05:32.791 --> 05:35.833
[sniffles] "...aged 35."

05:37.458 --> 05:38.583
What the fuck is this?

05:38.583 --> 05:41.041
Yeah, that is awful. Are we going with 35?

05:41.041 --> 05:43.375
A fucking robo-chimp
rips off my sister's face

05:43.375 --> 05:45.250
- and I'm saddened!
- [Roderick] Enough!

05:45.250 --> 05:46.833
Put it in your own words then,

05:46.833 --> 05:49.000
plagiarize "Candle in the Wind"
for all I care,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.125
but everyone toes the line.

05:51.750 --> 05:55.250
This is not about sticking together,
it's about forming a fucking wall.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.791
And in case you haven't noticed,
Morella's in the hospital,

05:57.791 --> 05:59.666
Prospero is dead, and Camille is dead.

05:59.666 --> 06:02.583
So save the static until I figure out
what the fuck is going on.

06:02.583 --> 06:06.500
And until then, I don't care if Madeline
tells you to fart into a microphone

06:06.500 --> 06:08.708
on national television, you fucking do it.

06:10.208 --> 06:12.375
We're at battle stations,
I'm the commanding officer,

06:12.375 --> 06:15.375
I don't wanna hear anything but,
"Sir, yes, sir."

06:17.375 --> 06:18.458
You get me?

06:20.000 --> 06:20.958
Sir, yes, sir?

06:20.958 --> 06:23.500
[Madeline] Now that
that's out of our systems,

06:23.500 --> 06:25.041
we can head outside

06:25.041 --> 06:27.208
- and Leo will do his part.
- [sniffles] Ah.

06:31.041 --> 06:33.458
Have Tammy or Froderick
do your soundbites.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.125
- Don't call me that.
- [Leo] Fuck this!

06:35.125 --> 06:36.916
- Leo!
- What? Don't like it?

06:36.916 --> 06:38.625
Cut me out the fucking will!

06:38.625 --> 06:41.916
Give my share to the next junkie tart
you find at the ER.

06:42.875 --> 06:43.875
[sniffles]

07:00.208 --> 07:01.083
[door opens]

07:01.083 --> 07:02.916
- Is Juno in the will?
- [door closes]

07:02.916 --> 07:05.583
Oh, no. Juno's not really
in the will. [chuckles]

07:08.250 --> 07:09.208
Is she, Dad?

07:09.208 --> 07:11.958
I am still in the room. So...

07:12.208 --> 07:14.416
[Arthur] <i>This is what I wanted you to see.</i>

07:14.416 --> 07:16.958
The night guard was supposed to be
Philip Fasullo.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.666
He works most weeknight shifts.

07:18.666 --> 07:20.250
[Madeline] Doesn't look like Philip.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.458
[Arthur] He was called off.

07:21.458 --> 07:25.166
Someone from Corporate
called his supervisor, stood him down.

07:25.166 --> 07:28.750
We don't know who called,
and we don't know who that woman is.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.416
- Do we have audio?
- We do not.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.416
Why the fuck not?

07:31.416 --> 07:35.000
That isn't really a thing
typically with security cameras.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.166
Stop right there.

07:39.583 --> 07:40.500
Enhance.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.750
[Arthur] That also isn't really a thing.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.291
You can't enhance this image?

07:44.291 --> 07:47.333
You see it all the time on TV.
They hit a button, it enhances it.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.916
You can zoom in,
but that doesn't enhance it.

07:49.916 --> 07:53.291
- Well then, please zoom in, Arthur.
- All right, fine.

07:55.916 --> 07:58.208
- Recognize her?
- [Roderick] It's tough to tell.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.708
Maybe if you could,
I don't know, enhance it.

08:01.458 --> 08:02.458
Mads?

08:02.458 --> 08:06.000
Um, I don't know. I don't think so.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.125
We don't even have
any female security guards at RUE.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.375
Not right now.

08:10.375 --> 08:13.625
So all we know is she shouldn't be there.

08:13.625 --> 08:16.000
Which means this was somehow intentional.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.416
Do we think this is the same woman
from Perry's club?

08:19.416 --> 08:20.791
I can't confirm that yet.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.958
[Madeline] We don't need
to confirm anything, do we?

08:22.958 --> 08:25.916
Tell everyone to take up arms.
We are at war.

08:25.916 --> 08:27.916
I don't know who, I don't know how,

08:27.916 --> 08:30.916
but I know what it feels like
when a bullet flies by,

08:30.916 --> 08:33.166
even if I can't hear the shot.

08:33.666 --> 08:36.458
Whoever the fuck this woman is,
find her now.

08:38.333 --> 08:42.000
We haven't even made arrangements
for Perry yet, and now we have to, what?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.458
How does it work? Double them up?

08:43.458 --> 08:46.833
What's worse? A double funeral,
or attending two separate ones?

08:46.833 --> 08:49.333
I don't even own anything funeral black.

08:49.333 --> 08:52.791
- [Julius] We can get you something.
- I don't even own a black suit!

08:52.791 --> 08:56.958
Oh, no, wait. That's not true.
I do have one.

08:56.958 --> 08:59.541
False alarm. It's just fucking satin!

08:59.541 --> 09:00.708
I'll take care of it.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.250
I can hear Camille's voice
in my head right now.

09:03.250 --> 09:06.375
"Satin is silk for poor people,
no one should wear it to a funeral,

09:06.375 --> 09:08.583
unless they died in it." Fuck's sake.

09:09.125 --> 09:13.375
This is tough and you can't
talk your way out of it, I get it.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
I get it.

09:17.583 --> 09:18.958
Just tell me what I can do.

09:23.583 --> 09:24.958
Okay. Got it.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.500
Have you seen Pluto
since you brought her back in?

09:31.500 --> 09:33.750
I haven't seen her yet,
I worry she got back out.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.916
I don't know. She's here. Promise.
Just skittish.

09:36.916 --> 09:39.166
Might need to shake off some trauma.

09:39.166 --> 09:40.916
I'm just pissed about the Gucci collar.

09:40.916 --> 09:42.083
Don't sweat it.

09:42.875 --> 09:46.250
I'll put out more food for her though.
Maybe we can coax her out.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.541
Yeah.

09:48.958 --> 09:49.875
[sighs]

10:02.708 --> 10:04.125
- [cat snarls]
- Fuck!

10:04.125 --> 10:05.250
Jules! Jules!

10:09.291 --> 10:11.166
- [breathing heavily]
- [Julius] What?

10:11.166 --> 10:12.500
Just missed her.

10:17.666 --> 10:19.666
[people murmuring]

10:25.750 --> 10:29.125
Your Honor, we should consider
the possibility this is intentional.

10:31.041 --> 10:32.416
I'll give it a few more minutes.

10:32.416 --> 10:35.583
With respect,
if I was a half hour late to court,

10:35.583 --> 10:37.750
I'd expect to be charged with contempt.

10:37.750 --> 10:41.583
- What are you suggesting, Mr. Dupin?
- Just an observation.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.583
It feels like there are different
rules for people like the Ushers,

10:44.583 --> 10:46.458
and apparently their counsel.

10:46.458 --> 10:48.083
Save it for the jury, Mr. Dupin.

10:51.791 --> 10:53.333
[doors open]

10:53.333 --> 10:55.625
- [people murmuring]
- [doors close]

11:00.541 --> 11:01.666
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

11:01.666 --> 11:03.708
[judge] Mr. Dupin and I
were just discussing

11:03.708 --> 11:06.541
the parameters
of contempt of court, Mr. Pym.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.000
Yours and his own, it seems.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.291
[Arthur] I'm afraid it couldn't be helped.

11:11.291 --> 11:15.125
The Usher family has sadly been burdened
by another death in the family.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.750
Camille L'Espanaye is dead.

11:16.750 --> 11:20.416
So, I apologize.
It has been a... a busy morning.

11:21.458 --> 11:22.833
[judge] Sorry to hear this.

11:22.833 --> 11:25.208
[Arthur] The family,
understandably, is in shock.

11:25.208 --> 11:27.958
I'm afraid I have no further information
at this time.

11:27.958 --> 11:30.125
The government was, of course, unaware.

11:31.541 --> 11:32.791
What happened exactly?

11:32.791 --> 11:37.083
[judge] We are going to reconvene Monday,
barring further disruption.

11:37.083 --> 11:40.750
Our sympathies are with the Usher family
during this very difficult time.

11:40.750 --> 11:41.666
[gavel bangs]

11:41.666 --> 11:43.958
- [judge] Court is adjourned.
- [clerk] All rise.

11:43.958 --> 11:45.250
- Arthur.
- Not now.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.250
[Roderick] <i>So, why was she here?</i>

11:50.750 --> 11:51.666
I don't know.

11:51.833 --> 11:54.250
Well, just tell me.
I'm going to find out anyway.

11:55.041 --> 11:57.375
Pops, I don't know. I honestly don't.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.875
Well, she was onto a scent
and she was here.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.333
Which means she was onto something
to do with the work,

12:02.333 --> 12:04.750
or she was onto something to do with you.

12:04.750 --> 12:06.666
She had a nose for secrets. She was...

12:07.250 --> 12:08.500
Had a knack for snooping.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.541
You see, I can't tell if you're asking
if I'm the informant,

12:11.541 --> 12:14.000
- or implying Camille was.
- It wasn't Camille.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.416
- All right. If you say so.
- I say so.

12:16.416 --> 12:19.833
- She was after you, or after the tech.
- God, just ask me already.

12:19.833 --> 12:20.958
- Is it you?
- [scoffs]

12:22.166 --> 12:23.625
Maybe you talked to the Feds.

12:24.208 --> 12:26.833
Get a leg up on the others.
Didn't think it would go this far,

12:26.833 --> 12:29.708
- now there's no way out of it.
- Don't be a fucking twit.

12:29.708 --> 12:33.750
You know what? Fuck you if you think that,
'cause I would bleed for this family.

12:34.291 --> 12:37.166
- So why was she here?
- I don't know!

12:37.833 --> 12:40.500
Maybe you told her
to go and get a profile done on me.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.625
[sighs] I, um...

12:49.750 --> 12:52.125
I think that she was looking
at the chimpanzees.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.083
Why?

12:53.083 --> 12:55.375
Because I think she wanted
to torpedo my project.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.458
- Why?
- For fun? [sighs] I don't know.

12:58.458 --> 13:01.500
You know how much money I spent
to smooth over those chimps?

13:01.500 --> 13:03.583
- I do.
- You know what the waiver cost?

13:03.583 --> 13:06.500
- I had to build ten miles of habitat.
- I know.

13:07.833 --> 13:10.666
And this animal...
I mean, what did you do to it, Vic?

13:11.208 --> 13:14.041
The device absolutely does not
increase aggression.

13:14.041 --> 13:15.333
Where is it now?

13:15.333 --> 13:16.416
It's dead.

13:16.416 --> 13:19.833
No, not the monkey, for fuck's sake,

13:19.833 --> 13:24.541
the $200 million of intellectual property
wrapped around its shitty, dead heart.

13:24.541 --> 13:26.833
It's retrieved,
and the animal is irrelevant.

13:26.833 --> 13:28.750
No, it's... it's priority one.

13:28.750 --> 13:31.250
As people look into this,
it'll be at the center.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.375
The monkey itself might be
a goddamn crime scene.

13:33.375 --> 13:36.250
Should I just pull the plug?
Put this out of its misery.

13:36.250 --> 13:39.041
Free up money for Leo's video games,
or Tammy's bugs?

13:39.041 --> 13:41.708
Okay, look. We're moving to human trials.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.583
- That's what I've been waiting to hear.
- Yeah, we're ready.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.291
Do you think you have the data
to get it approved?

13:51.916 --> 13:54.666
Well, as a matter of fact, yeah. We do.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.000
- This is excellent news.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:59.750 --> 14:02.250
I know I've been, um...

14:04.625 --> 14:05.625
It's important.

14:06.458 --> 14:09.250
More than you know. It's important.

14:11.291 --> 14:12.500
[Arthur] <i>Her belongings.</i>

14:13.041 --> 14:15.791
I was able to grab these
before the police.

14:16.583 --> 14:19.541
- We've been through her primary phone.
- How?

14:19.541 --> 14:21.083
With the password.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.291
You have her password?

14:22.791 --> 14:24.166
We have all your passwords.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.208
Oh, I guess that makes sense.

14:26.208 --> 14:29.458
The only thing, and this is delicate,

14:29.458 --> 14:32.000
so I'm going to need you
to treat this delicately,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.125
do you understand?

14:33.125 --> 14:34.208
I understand.

14:36.541 --> 14:41.166
I don't actually understand at all
what you're saying.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.375
What is delicate?

14:43.791 --> 14:46.875
This was in Morrie's bag.
Do you recognize it?

14:48.250 --> 14:49.708
No, that isn't hers.

14:49.708 --> 14:52.416
We're sure it's hers.
We can't open it though.

14:53.666 --> 14:56.375
Well, I'm telling you, this isn't hers.

14:56.375 --> 14:57.750
That's fine.

14:57.750 --> 15:01.666
We thought maybe you could, uh,
try a couple of common combinations,

15:01.666 --> 15:02.833
see if it unlocks.

15:03.583 --> 15:04.875
But it isn't hers.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.250
I understand.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.875
Maybe try anyway.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.458
[Frederick sighs]

15:12.791 --> 15:14.250
It's usually our anniversary.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.791
- [phone vibrates]
- Nope. Um...

15:18.916 --> 15:20.041
Lenore's birthday?

15:24.125 --> 15:25.666
- [phone vibrates]
- Nope.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.791
I can keep trying, but it'll lock me out.

15:28.791 --> 15:32.291
Her company phone checks out.
Nothing out of the ordinary at all.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.041
This one though... [chuckles]

15:35.375 --> 15:38.125
And I really need to see
what's on that phone.

15:39.291 --> 15:41.625
What about her ring?

15:41.625 --> 15:44.041
Her wedding ring.
Have they found that yet?

15:44.041 --> 15:45.208
[hesitates]

15:45.208 --> 15:46.333
Where is that?

15:46.333 --> 15:48.916
Please... try the phone.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.416
[phone vibrates]

15:59.125 --> 16:00.458
[inhales sharply]

16:17.500 --> 16:18.708
Take a left up there.

16:20.583 --> 16:24.250
I need to do some things
before I go back to the office.

16:25.625 --> 16:26.958
I'll tell you where to go.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.708
Don't be stupid, Madeline, this is crazy.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.125
This is fucking crazy.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.333
[siren wailing faintly]

17:23.666 --> 17:25.333
[raven cawing, flapping wings]

18:06.625 --> 18:08.458
[metallic clinking]

18:16.250 --> 18:18.250
[metallic clinking]

18:23.458 --> 18:25.083
[Victorine] <i>You sign there.</i>

18:29.083 --> 18:29.916
[chuckles]

18:30.750 --> 18:33.750
Jeez. It's a lot of paperwork.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.166
Seem like waivers, most of these.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.125
It's all very standard, I promise.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.000
It's a good thing I trust you.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.250
Well, you know,
we have to trust each other.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.333
- It's a big part of it.
- I suppose so.

18:45.333 --> 18:48.000
Because you hear a lot of stories.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.916
Like big pharmaceutical companies,
a lot of them,

18:50.916 --> 18:53.875
they test their drugs
in lower-income countries.

18:54.541 --> 18:55.583
Do you know that?

18:55.583 --> 18:57.416
I have heard things like that, yes.

18:57.416 --> 19:01.083
Always figured it was because people
were more likely to take the money.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.083
Less likely to complain.

19:03.083 --> 19:06.250
[hesitates] Maybe even reluctant
to report the side-effects.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.250
Or less likely to even notice them.

19:08.250 --> 19:12.041
Or maybe they don't know the risks,
or they don't understand them.

19:12.041 --> 19:14.416
There is another edge
to that sword, though.

19:15.250 --> 19:19.833
So, perhaps it offers them access
to medication and procedures

19:19.833 --> 19:21.666
they might otherwise
not be able to afford.

19:21.666 --> 19:23.958
Some of the smartest trials,
they happen in the places

19:23.958 --> 19:27.250
where the need
for what's being tested is the highest.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.250
I guess it's kind of like
why this opportunity is...

19:31.250 --> 19:32.541
Why it's going to you.

19:33.541 --> 19:35.041
You actually need it.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.416
That's why I'm particularly
grateful for this.

19:37.416 --> 19:42.416
That beautiful device being tested
in the good old US of A.

19:42.416 --> 19:46.500
On someone who's life could really change.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.291
I'm lucky to be a part of it.

19:49.625 --> 19:52.041
Now, there you go. All done.

19:52.041 --> 19:53.333
- Thank you.
- [chuckles]

20:00.875 --> 20:05.875
This, uh, goes on my heart
like a pacemaker?

20:05.875 --> 20:08.250
[chuckling] Oh, uh...

20:08.250 --> 20:10.875
It's a quantum leap forward
from a pacemaker.

20:10.875 --> 20:14.166
It's a predominantly passive implant.
At least, at first.

20:15.791 --> 20:19.833
It'll gather real-time data about
your heart and entire vascular system,

20:19.833 --> 20:21.541
evaluating its efficiency.

20:23.458 --> 20:27.958
It can locate blockages
before they become clots, or strokes.

20:28.750 --> 20:32.500
This can help prevent
numerous cardiovascular issues.

20:33.541 --> 20:34.791
It can save your life.

20:35.416 --> 20:39.291
And then, one day, if it all goes right,
it will take over,

20:39.291 --> 20:43.583
keep your heart beating perfectly in rest,

20:43.583 --> 20:47.333
stress, exercise, exertion, all of it.

20:47.333 --> 20:50.875
For many, many more decades to come.

20:56.333 --> 20:57.166
Okay then.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Okay then.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.208
When do we start?

21:04.208 --> 21:06.875
Uh, well, you know, um...

21:07.708 --> 21:10.541
I need a couple more days
to make sure everything's above board.

21:10.541 --> 21:14.500
We don't want to rush these things.
But I think by the end of the week.

21:15.833 --> 21:17.750
Yeah. We'll be good to go.

21:17.750 --> 21:20.375
And Dr. Ruiz will perform
the surgery herself?

21:20.375 --> 21:21.416
Yeah.

21:21.416 --> 21:23.250
Oh, yeah. She is...

21:23.250 --> 21:25.875
You know, she's very,
very excited about this too.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.500
- Okay. [laughs]
- Okay.

21:30.625 --> 21:32.625
[both laughing]

21:47.291 --> 21:48.416
[Lenore] Dad, you gotta eat.

21:48.416 --> 21:50.250
I don't think I've seen you eat
in two days.

21:50.250 --> 21:52.291
[sighs] I'm okay, peanut.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.041
Have you ever seen this phone?

21:55.041 --> 21:56.583
Did your mom have it, maybe?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.750
No, I haven't.
Why would mom have a second phone?

21:58.750 --> 22:01.375
I don't think she did.
I think they made a mistake,

22:02.750 --> 22:05.416
and someone else's phone
got mixed in with her things.

22:06.625 --> 22:10.416
And I think that we should find
whoever this phone belongs to

22:10.416 --> 22:12.666
- and get it back to them, right?
- Yeah, we should.

22:12.666 --> 22:17.333
So, do you have...
I mean, I know you kids these days,

22:17.333 --> 22:20.000
you can hack into all sorts of things,
can't you?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.208
Teenagers are all about
hacking into stuff.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.458
Not really.
You're thinking of hackers, Dad.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.375
Well, do you have any idea
how we can get in there?

22:27.375 --> 22:29.875
We use one of three things
to get into our phones

22:29.875 --> 22:31.083
and it always works.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.583
Passcode, our fingerprint, or our face.

22:33.583 --> 22:34.666
Mine does that too.

22:34.666 --> 22:36.250
[gasps] You don't say!

22:37.416 --> 22:38.500
[sighs]

22:39.250 --> 22:40.458
Well, shit.

22:41.583 --> 22:42.625
[sighs]

22:42.625 --> 22:45.625
The wallpaper on that one
is factory preset, if it matters.

22:45.625 --> 22:46.708
What does that mean?

22:47.541 --> 22:49.291
I mean, Mom uses pictures of cakes.

22:50.250 --> 22:52.083
That's right. She did, didn't she?

22:52.875 --> 22:54.541
So, probably not hers.

22:58.166 --> 22:59.166
It's not hers.

23:21.541 --> 23:22.541
Honey.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.500
You're killing me.

23:26.666 --> 23:27.666
Sorry.

23:28.333 --> 23:30.291
I'm losing it. I don't get it.

23:30.291 --> 23:32.208
I took enough of those yellow pills.

23:32.208 --> 23:34.333
I should be in a two-day coma.

23:34.333 --> 23:36.208
- I'm sorry.
- [sighs]

23:37.208 --> 23:39.083
- Anything I can do?
- [sighs]

23:41.708 --> 23:43.208
Well, now that you mention it.

23:44.500 --> 23:47.458
Mmm, seriously? That's what you're
thinking about right now?

23:47.458 --> 23:49.500
People grieve in different ways.

23:52.416 --> 23:53.250
[chuckles]

23:54.375 --> 23:55.958
Well, if it'll help you sleep...

23:58.541 --> 23:59.541
Okay.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.208
[exhales] Mmm.

24:04.333 --> 24:07.625
[exhales, sniffles]

24:09.166 --> 24:11.000
[exhales]

24:24.166 --> 24:25.541
Creepy little fuck.

24:26.166 --> 24:27.166
[Julius] Hmm?

24:27.166 --> 24:30.166
Oh, no, not you,
you're brilliant. [exhales]

24:43.708 --> 24:44.541
- Oh!
- [thuds]

24:44.541 --> 24:45.458
[Julius groans]

24:45.458 --> 24:49.416
- Jules. Sorry! Jules!
- [groaning] My fucking nose.

24:50.833 --> 24:52.708
I'm sorry! Fuck!

24:56.416 --> 24:57.416
What the...

24:59.458 --> 25:01.541
Are you fucking joking?

25:03.458 --> 25:04.500
[breathing heavily]

25:07.166 --> 25:10.166
Sorry, Jules, your cat left...
Your cat just...

25:11.000 --> 25:14.750
I'm throwing away the sheets.
And probably burning the bed!

25:14.750 --> 25:16.000
[exhales]

25:16.000 --> 25:17.416
And we might have to move.

25:17.958 --> 25:19.166
[Roderick] <i>Displacement.</i>

25:19.166 --> 25:24.125
The other go-to coping mechanism
in my family.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.375
It's when you direct your more
intense reactions

25:27.375 --> 25:31.083
towards something or someone
that doesn't feel threatening.

25:31.083 --> 25:34.208
So you get to react and be angry,

25:34.208 --> 25:37.125
be abusive, be violent, even,

25:37.125 --> 25:39.916
but you don't risk
significant consequences.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.833
- I'm familiar.
- I bet you are.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.750
How many nights did poor Ernie
bear the brunt meant for me?

25:47.208 --> 25:49.875
Like I said, I'm familiar.

25:50.541 --> 25:52.458
Napoleon was most like me in this way.

25:54.166 --> 25:55.166
Of all of them.

25:56.458 --> 25:59.875
Denial, displacement, projection.

26:01.916 --> 26:03.666
But see, I wanted something better.

26:05.208 --> 26:07.333
Something better for him. For all of them.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.291
A trait of mine that seemed
to skip them somehow...

26:12.208 --> 26:13.166
Sublimation.

26:13.166 --> 26:16.625
That is something that is one of the few
coping mechanisms

26:16.625 --> 26:18.083
that's considered positive.

26:18.083 --> 26:21.791
Sublimation is when a person
chooses to redirect strong emotions

26:21.791 --> 26:26.416
into an object or an activity
that's appropriate and safe.

26:26.416 --> 26:29.125
So, instead of lashing out
at your employees,

26:29.125 --> 26:31.041
you pour your energy into kickbox--

26:31.041 --> 26:33.125
- [thuds]
- [breathing heavily]

26:37.333 --> 26:38.333
What the hell?

26:43.291 --> 26:46.041
I was talking! I was fucking talking!

26:46.041 --> 26:47.458
Jesus!

26:48.916 --> 26:51.500
- The hell is wrong with you?
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.583
Don't you raise your voice to me.

26:53.583 --> 26:56.041
You talk about displacement all you like,

26:56.041 --> 26:58.041
don't point that shit at me, understand?

26:58.041 --> 27:02.166
I will knock your goddamn lights out,
you raise your voice at me.

27:02.166 --> 27:04.416
You're right. [breath trembling]

27:05.625 --> 27:07.541
Sorry. It's a...

27:10.041 --> 27:11.875
That was... That was not your fault.

27:15.125 --> 27:18.208
I do... I respect you, Auggie.
I do respect you. I always have.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.750
You've had a funny way of showing it
over the years.

27:32.458 --> 27:34.375
You remember the day we met?

27:37.666 --> 27:38.708
Of course I do.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.583
I thought a lot of things that day.

27:51.625 --> 27:53.958
A lot of things I'd never thought before.

27:55.833 --> 27:58.000
I saw the world different after we met.

28:01.333 --> 28:04.583
Never imagined we'd end up here, though.

28:06.791 --> 28:08.791
[doorbell buzzing]

28:18.916 --> 28:20.083
[Roderick] Yes?

28:20.083 --> 28:23.666
Hi there, sorry to bother.
I'm looking for Roderick Usher.

28:23.666 --> 28:25.291
- Why?
- Are you Roderick?

28:25.291 --> 28:26.375
[baby whines]

28:26.375 --> 28:29.083
You'll have to tell me
who you are at some point.

28:29.083 --> 28:31.833
Yeah, I just don't want you
to shut the door.

28:31.833 --> 28:35.208
My name's Auguste Dupin,
and I'm trying to do a little good,

28:35.208 --> 28:36.875
and I need some help doing that

28:36.875 --> 28:39.500
and I'm hoping you're
the kind of man who'll help.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.375
I'm a Medicare fraud investigator,

28:41.375 --> 28:43.583
and I'm here
because you work at Fortunato.

28:44.208 --> 28:45.583
Uh, please.

28:45.583 --> 28:49.208
I have 36 names on this list
and I've had 30 doors shut on my face.

28:49.208 --> 28:51.375
Just hear me out. I'm not after you.

28:51.375 --> 28:53.833
I just want to get to the bottom
of some things.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.708
Set some things right. Please.

28:55.708 --> 28:57.458
- [baby whines]
- [Annabel] Come in.

28:57.458 --> 28:58.541
[sighs]

28:59.875 --> 29:00.875
Come on in.

29:09.625 --> 29:10.750
Oh, thank you.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.208
So, again,
if you could just look at these.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.208
I don't know what those are.

29:16.208 --> 29:18.083
Consent forms for a drug trial.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.708
Dr. Brevit, see, on all of these...

29:21.750 --> 29:24.666
- How well do you know Dr. Brevit?
- I don't know Dr. Brevit.

29:24.666 --> 29:26.166
Who is Dr. Brevit?

29:27.125 --> 29:30.458
He's an associate
of Fortunato's clinical trials division.

29:30.458 --> 29:32.125
You're sure you don't know him?

29:32.125 --> 29:35.208
I'm sorry.
I know you probably can't say a lot,

29:35.208 --> 29:37.666
but if you'd just tell us
what you're after,

29:37.666 --> 29:39.583
- if he can help, he will.
- Yeah.

29:41.166 --> 29:45.000
See, a lot of these people apparently
didn't sign these forms themselves.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.416
I believe some of these signatures
are forged.

29:47.416 --> 29:51.000
And I believe this doctor has been
enlisting some of them in studies

29:51.000 --> 29:53.500
without fully informing them,
or their families,

29:54.250 --> 29:56.458
about possible side effects.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.375
Major side effects.

29:58.375 --> 29:59.666
Good Lord.

29:59.666 --> 30:01.291
[Auguste] Some of them are dead now.

30:01.291 --> 30:03.833
- And some of their bodies, well--
- Mr. Dupin, I--

30:03.833 --> 30:05.416
[Auguste] Auguste is fine.

30:05.958 --> 30:10.416
Auguste. Um, I don't know
much about the pharmaceutical industry,

30:10.416 --> 30:12.166
but I do know my husband,

30:12.166 --> 30:15.166
and if he had any idea
that any of this was going on,

30:15.166 --> 30:16.416
he would have taken action.

30:16.416 --> 30:19.000
Yeah, that's right.
I don't know anything about any of this.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.833
I really don't.

30:20.833 --> 30:23.958
You see, that's the thing.
You're on my list for a reason.

30:24.958 --> 30:26.666
When Brevit enrolls a new patient,

30:26.666 --> 30:30.458
that enrolment letter goes through
several departments for verification.

30:30.458 --> 30:33.375
And some of them are even supposed
to contact the patient

30:33.375 --> 30:36.208
and confirm the data, arrange payment,
things like that.

30:36.208 --> 30:40.208
Confirm that they're competent
and actually consenting as well.

30:41.208 --> 30:42.833
- What are you getting at?
- Well...

30:44.125 --> 30:45.875
Your signature is here.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.125
Next to Brevit's.

30:50.958 --> 30:51.833
Here, can I?

30:51.833 --> 30:53.375
[Auguste] And here.

30:54.083 --> 30:57.333
Here. Here. And... and here.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.583
- This isn't his signature.
- Honey, hang on.

30:59.583 --> 31:00.875
It isn't, I can tell.

31:00.875 --> 31:03.333
- Are you saying it was forged?
- No.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.583
It isn't.

31:04.583 --> 31:08.000
She's not saying that,
and this is not on the record, right?

31:08.000 --> 31:12.458
- [Auguste] Yes, but--
- I cannot recall if I did or if I did not

31:12.458 --> 31:14.625
sign these particular papers.

31:14.625 --> 31:18.000
But I'm happy to look into it
as soon as possible.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.666
I just don't recall.

31:20.875 --> 31:22.166
Right now, at least.

31:25.166 --> 31:29.875
A lot of people are having a hard time
recalling a lot of things.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.875
What do they do to you all over there?

31:35.958 --> 31:38.458
Everybody at Fortunato's
concussed or something.

31:38.458 --> 31:39.833
I'm sorry.

31:40.583 --> 31:42.708
You're a lower rung guy, I know that much.

31:42.708 --> 31:45.583
Me too. We both got a boss, don't we?

31:45.583 --> 31:48.958
And I get it, you say the wrong thing,
or she says the wrong thing,

31:48.958 --> 31:51.000
it could knock you right off that rung.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.291
Out of the job even.

31:53.958 --> 31:54.958
I see that baby.

31:55.958 --> 31:57.541
I see those homemade toys.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.500
Someone knit those dolls,
carved that train.

32:00.500 --> 32:03.375
You guys go hand to mouth. Just like me.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.208
You've got another child.

32:08.958 --> 32:10.083
Older boy by the look.

32:11.666 --> 32:14.583
Sleeping I'm guessing,
and I don't count a lot of bedrooms,

32:14.583 --> 32:16.583
so I figure they sleep with you.

32:18.041 --> 32:20.541
Jar of honey up there
on the counter's almost gone.

32:20.541 --> 32:22.583
Dried honey on the table and floors.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.291
That's a home remedy for the older one.

32:26.375 --> 32:29.791
And I see the elderberries, echinacea.
You're throwing a lot at it.

32:29.791 --> 32:32.375
And he's sleeping now,
because he was up all night.

32:32.375 --> 32:35.875
Coffee mugs by the sink says
one of you was up all night with him.

32:35.875 --> 32:37.666
Trying to make him take the honey.

32:38.916 --> 32:41.583
That many mugs,
I think both of you were up.

32:42.625 --> 32:43.833
Shifts, probably.

32:46.666 --> 32:49.458
You're good parents
who can't afford the medicine,

32:49.458 --> 32:52.583
so, yeah, you're smart not to recall.

32:52.583 --> 32:56.500
Don't want to risk it.
Can't afford to say the wrong thing.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.916
Hard to say the wrong thing.

32:59.791 --> 33:02.583
Even harder to do the right thing.

33:10.333 --> 33:11.791
But if you change your mind...

33:14.583 --> 33:16.708
[footsteps receding]

33:16.708 --> 33:18.791
[door opens and closes]

33:18.791 --> 33:20.208
[Rufus] <i>It's bullshit.</i>

33:20.208 --> 33:22.625
And I'm sorry that it showed up
at your door.

33:23.333 --> 33:27.208
I'll call Health and Human Services,
make sure they stop harassing our people.

33:27.208 --> 33:28.375
They have no right.

33:29.166 --> 33:31.416
- Yeah, but about the forms.
- Fucking people.

33:31.416 --> 33:34.625
You know, they think that medicine
happens in a vacuum.

33:35.375 --> 33:38.333
Like we lock ourselves in a clean,
empty room

33:38.333 --> 33:41.375
with a beaker and a Bunsen burner
and a bunch of test tubes

33:41.375 --> 33:43.250
and walk out with penicillin.

33:43.250 --> 33:49.000
They have no respect for what it takes
to develop and test and market a drug.

33:50.250 --> 33:54.041
The real laboratory, okay,
the real lab is the real world.

33:55.750 --> 33:59.333
- The signatures on the forms--
- Do you know what the real world is, Rod?

33:59.333 --> 34:00.375
Variables.

34:00.375 --> 34:02.833
'Cause in the real world
there are side effects,

34:02.833 --> 34:06.458
and surprises, and anomalies,
and acts of God,

34:06.458 --> 34:09.583
and all of that, and we weather that.

34:09.583 --> 34:13.750
For all the whiney little sheep out there,
we weather all of it.

34:13.750 --> 34:17.458
The complaints, and the lawsuits,
and the investigator, and the whole mess.

34:17.458 --> 34:20.000
Why? So their dick can stay hard
a little longer?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.916
They can kick that headache
a little sooner?

34:21.916 --> 34:24.500
And then they attack us for it.
Fucking people.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.208
My signature was forged.

34:28.666 --> 34:29.833
No, it wasn't.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.500
Yes, it was.

34:31.500 --> 34:34.083
It definitely was on at least
a half a dozen forms.

34:37.458 --> 34:39.083
You a team player, Rod? Hmm?

34:39.916 --> 34:41.625
You part of the Fortunato team?

34:41.625 --> 34:42.708
Yeah, I am.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.083
What does that mean to you? In your mind?

34:48.041 --> 34:49.750
I don't know. I think it means--

34:49.750 --> 34:51.166
Because if you come to me,

34:51.166 --> 34:54.708
you tell me that your name was forged
on important internal documents,

34:54.708 --> 34:57.666
documents that, apparently,
have been stolen I might add,

34:57.666 --> 35:00.875
well, then you're not on the team at all.
You're on their team.

35:00.875 --> 35:03.666
I'm just asking you to explain--

35:03.666 --> 35:08.000
And I am explaining to you
that this company is a team.

35:08.625 --> 35:11.500
We are a unit.
This isn't just about sticking together.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.666
This is about forming a fucking wall.

35:14.291 --> 35:17.500
There are elements out there
that would threaten us if we let them.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.708
We are all at fucking battle stations
right now.

35:19.708 --> 35:22.708
I am the commanding officer
and I don't wanna hear anything

35:22.708 --> 35:25.500
that isn't, "Sir, yes, sir."
Do you get me?

35:28.333 --> 35:30.458
- I get you.
- Then say it.

35:33.583 --> 35:34.583
Sir, yes, sir.

35:37.458 --> 35:38.458
Better.

35:39.916 --> 35:42.708
Now, [exhales] I'm going
to look into this, okay?

35:42.708 --> 35:45.500
And if there's some clerical error
with your signature,

35:45.500 --> 35:47.250
well, we'll have that corrected.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.250
It's all the same thing, isn't it?

35:50.250 --> 35:53.416
I mean, everybody in this building,
we're on the same team.

35:54.333 --> 35:55.833
Everybody approves everything.

35:55.833 --> 35:58.750
No matter whose name is on the form.
So what's the point?

35:59.666 --> 36:01.916
House can't be divided against itself,
can it?

36:01.916 --> 36:06.000
I'm on the team, 100%, sir.

36:07.416 --> 36:08.458
That's great.

36:11.833 --> 36:12.833
And, Rod...

36:15.166 --> 36:18.291
These clerical errors, they're old.

36:19.125 --> 36:21.791
They're from before you showed
your true potential.

36:21.791 --> 36:24.041
Before I took you under my wing,
as it were.

36:24.875 --> 36:27.583
These kinds of errors,
they can't happen now.

36:28.916 --> 36:30.833
You're in the officers' club now, son.

36:31.416 --> 36:32.583
So, you can relax.

36:32.583 --> 36:35.750
You just remember whose team you're on,
you'll be fine.

36:37.333 --> 36:38.333
Totally.

36:39.375 --> 36:40.416
Sir, yes, sir.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.208
- You know what kind of car I drive, Rod?
- No.

36:46.166 --> 36:49.583
No? Well, it's a Ferrari.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.666
- Nice.
- Yeah, you bet your ass it's nice.

36:52.375 --> 36:54.708
1979 Ferrari 308 GTS.

36:54.708 --> 36:57.958
Rosso Dino red,
natural tan Tuscan leather interior,

36:57.958 --> 37:01.833
Targa top, 5-speed gauge shifter,
2.9 liter V8,

37:01.833 --> 37:04.166
puts out 292 horses.

37:04.166 --> 37:06.375
Goes zero to 60 in under eight seconds.

37:07.750 --> 37:09.625
It's not an ordinary car, Rod.

37:09.625 --> 37:13.375
This is an extraordinary car, okay?
This is not a car for just anybody.

37:13.375 --> 37:15.750
This is a car for a somebody.

37:15.750 --> 37:18.208
You drive a car like that,
you make a statement.

37:18.208 --> 37:22.041
About who you are, where you're going,
and how you get there.

37:23.041 --> 37:26.166
You follow my lead,
you keep your nose clean,

37:26.166 --> 37:28.166
your mouth shut, and your eyes open,

37:28.666 --> 37:31.000
pretty soon you'll be driving
any car you want.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.625
Parking it in the driveway of any house
that you could ever dream of buying.

37:37.250 --> 37:39.125
Because I'm a Candy Man, Rod.

37:39.125 --> 37:42.250
I'm Willy fucking Wonka,
and this is my chocolate factory.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.250
And you just got the Golden Ticket.

37:46.750 --> 37:48.166
You play your cards right...

37:50.041 --> 37:52.875
one day all this could be yours,
Charlie Bucket.

37:53.541 --> 37:56.458
Now, let's get a drink, huh?
It's gotta be noon somewhere.

37:57.750 --> 37:58.916
[Annabel] <i>You should quit.</i>

37:58.916 --> 38:01.291
- We'd starve.
- I'll get a job.

38:01.291 --> 38:03.875
How about a degree?
You gonna get one of those too?

38:03.875 --> 38:06.000
- Hey, now.
- I'm sorry.

38:08.083 --> 38:12.041
If I quit, I'm burned.
Gris would destroy me, I know too much.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.208
Maybe I go to a competitor first.

38:16.208 --> 38:20.083
I get in before Gris can destroy
my reputation. Or maybe...

38:21.458 --> 38:23.208
He said I'm a part of the club now.

38:23.708 --> 38:26.416
He's got my back.
Maybe I stay quiet just like he said.

38:26.416 --> 38:29.083
Or you could do, I don't know,
anything else.

38:29.083 --> 38:32.750
- This industry is ugly, Roderick.
- It doesn't have to be.

38:32.750 --> 38:37.333
Jesus Christ, both of you.
They forged your signature, Roderick.

38:37.333 --> 38:41.000
Your name, our name,
is on evidence of a crime.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.750
Christ, nobody knows they're the fall guy
until they're falling.

38:44.750 --> 38:47.625
You work for a competitor,
they'll never trust you.

38:48.250 --> 38:50.666
You stay at Fortunato,
they'll never respect you.

38:50.666 --> 38:54.333
You just ate a spoonful of their own shit
in front of them and smiled.

38:54.333 --> 38:57.250
You can't be part of the club now.
You can't be an equal.

38:57.250 --> 38:59.708
Not when they've watched you
eat their shit.

38:59.708 --> 39:00.916
That's just nature.

39:01.875 --> 39:05.666
Which is doubly fucked
because your father built this company.

39:05.666 --> 39:10.000
It's your birthright, Roderick.
Our birthright.

39:18.375 --> 39:19.833
You're gonna go to work...

39:22.458 --> 39:26.041
and you are going
to keep eating that shit.

39:28.375 --> 39:31.833
And you're going to make Rufus Griswold
think it's your favorite food.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.875
And then you're going to call this number.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.333
Your wife is right.

39:39.583 --> 39:41.375
It's the right thing to do.

39:42.625 --> 39:44.625
We're going to call him tomorrow.

39:44.625 --> 39:49.291
And you are going to become best friends...

39:50.458 --> 39:52.375
with Auguste Dupin.

39:55.916 --> 39:56.750
[Leo groans]

40:03.291 --> 40:05.750

- Yeah. Sorry.

40:06.833 --> 40:09.416

40:12.708 --> 40:14.125

40:14.125 --> 40:15.208

40:16.416 --> 40:17.458

40:17.458 --> 40:20.750

40:21.875 --> 40:24.166
Nah, I'm sure she's around here somewhere.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.208
Listen, I know you've been through a lot
and I know what I signed up for.

40:29.208 --> 40:32.000
You've always been very clear
about your recreational time.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.291

40:40.750 --> 40:41.833
Don't do it, Jules.

40:41.833 --> 40:46.000
I'm not saying, "Just say no,"
I'm saying I'm worried about you.

40:46.916 --> 40:49.791
Because you've always,
always had it under control,

40:49.791 --> 40:53.583
like you've got some kind of magic power,
but, babe, you are off your game.

40:54.541 --> 40:55.541
Slow down maybe.

40:55.541 --> 40:57.833
Call it a favor to me,
if you like it better.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.625
- Humor me?
- Mmm.

41:03.958 --> 41:04.958
[softly] Okay.

41:04.958 --> 41:06.666
[doorbell rings]

41:07.791 --> 41:13.500
[panting] Sorry to show up like this
and... take a minute. [chuckles]

41:20.916 --> 41:22.958

41:23.958 --> 41:25.375

41:27.416 --> 41:28.583
This is nice.

have you?

41:31.166 --> 41:32.416
No, uh...

41:33.791 --> 41:35.750
I was at the tree-housey one,

41:35.750 --> 41:40.041
but, I didn't, uh, didn't see this.
It's nice, it's fancy.

41:40.041 --> 41:42.333
It's like an artisanal brewery,
or something.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.541
[Leo] Well, it's gonna
change again shortly.

41:44.541 --> 41:48.416

He's dead and he doesn't know it.

41:48.416 --> 41:49.666
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:51.375 --> 41:54.208
Hey, I was hoping for some drugs.

41:55.666 --> 42:00.208
Sorry to be blunt about it, but that's it.
I... I want some drugs.

42:00.208 --> 42:03.291
I'm going through a rough time,
and Morrie, you know, well...

42:03.291 --> 42:05.125
Morrie, she's melted, you know.

42:05.125 --> 42:07.458
It turns out she has
this burner phone, and...

42:08.166 --> 42:11.666
[exhales] I can't help but wonder
why she was even at this...

42:13.458 --> 42:14.458
Perry's orgy?

42:14.458 --> 42:17.083
- Please, don't fucking say that word.
- Sorry, uh...

42:17.750 --> 42:19.583

42:20.250 --> 42:21.583
That can't be much better.

42:21.583 --> 42:24.666
I need something to get me focused
and get my energy up,

42:24.666 --> 42:28.750
and just make me feel not awful.

42:28.750 --> 42:30.333
Just for a minute.

42:32.041 --> 42:35.750
Something in coke for you?
You don't want the designer stuff.

42:36.291 --> 42:38.416

42:38.916 --> 42:42.458

Cats are predators. It's in their genes.

They were domesticated 10,000 years ago,

46:04.916 --> 46:07.541
No matter how cute and tiny
you keep breeding them...

46:08.583 --> 46:10.041

47:14.708 --> 47:16.041

Look, I know the rules.

51:19.625 --> 51:21.625
I would never see these girls
outside the house.

51:21.625 --> 51:23.375
Yeah, 'cause I'd fucking kill you.

51:24.083 --> 51:25.541
Are you sure that it was her?

51:25.541 --> 51:28.333
She was standing right behind you
wearing the same wig.

51:28.333 --> 51:30.041
You had to have seen her, Bill.

51:30.041 --> 51:31.958
Well, I didn't.
Did you get a freeze-frame?

51:31.958 --> 51:34.916
It's a live stream.
You know I can't get a freeze-frame.

51:38.125 --> 51:39.333
I'm sorry, Tam.

51:40.666 --> 51:41.833
I should have seen her,

51:41.833 --> 51:43.833
and I should have fucking told her
to get lost.

51:49.375 --> 51:50.250
[sighs]

51:51.333 --> 51:52.333
Listen...

51:53.166 --> 51:54.583
- Honey, you--
- What? No.

51:54.583 --> 51:56.333
You gotta sleep.

51:56.333 --> 51:57.583
Okay, seriously.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.791
This isn't healthy. You've gotta...

52:04.041 --> 52:09.833
I'm going to email Lauren and tell her
to tell Candy to give us a wide berth.

52:10.916 --> 52:12.500
- It's unprofessional.
- [typing]

52:12.500 --> 52:14.583
[piano music playing]

52:24.750 --> 52:26.333
[footsteps approaching]

52:28.000 --> 52:29.541
You look lost, old man.

52:32.166 --> 52:33.416
Sorry. I guess I am.

52:34.083 --> 52:35.958
I thought I'd distract you.

52:40.083 --> 52:41.083
How are you feeling?

52:42.041 --> 52:43.083
Fine.

52:45.666 --> 52:47.583
- How's your leg?
- It's fine.

52:47.583 --> 52:50.416
I was thinking, though.

52:50.416 --> 52:54.333
What if I backed off the Ligodone
for a bit?

52:56.708 --> 52:58.791
- Why?
- I don't know. Just been reading.

52:58.791 --> 53:01.166
I mean, I love it. I do. I just thought...

53:02.208 --> 53:04.875
Maybe see how I go without it
for a few days.

53:04.875 --> 53:06.375
Darling, how would that look?

53:06.875 --> 53:09.583
Besides, you're the proof positive.

53:09.583 --> 53:13.291
You're a walking rebuttal
to all those assholes out there.

53:14.166 --> 53:18.250
You've taken more Ligodone
than just about anybody I know,

53:18.250 --> 53:19.458
and look at you.

53:19.458 --> 53:22.083
- You're a vision. You're...
- [chuckles]

53:22.083 --> 53:24.458
You're thriving. You're pain-free.

53:25.750 --> 53:31.166
You are my most beautiful, perfect proof.

53:36.166 --> 53:39.416
You know, I could use a little cheering up
now you mention it.

53:55.208 --> 53:56.208
What do you say?

54:04.833 --> 54:05.958
[gasps]

54:13.583 --> 54:14.916
[breathing heavily]

54:14.916 --> 54:16.541
[glass breaking]

54:17.250 --> 54:18.375
[Juno] What's wrong?

54:19.625 --> 54:20.625
Roddie!

54:21.666 --> 54:23.875
- Roddie, Roddie, what's wrong?
- [breathing heavily]

54:23.875 --> 54:24.958
Roddie!

54:25.958 --> 54:26.875
[breath trembling]

54:26.875 --> 54:27.958
What's wrong?

54:29.458 --> 54:30.458
What's wrong?

54:33.125 --> 54:34.666
Excuse us, please.

54:36.125 --> 54:37.125
It's okay.

54:40.375 --> 54:43.291
- She shouldn't have called you.
- Of course she should have.

54:43.291 --> 54:45.291
- It's nothing.
- Don't insult me.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
[sighs]

54:50.750 --> 54:53.166
Doc came by a few nights ago to the house.

54:54.041 --> 54:55.291
Unannounced.

54:55.291 --> 54:56.625
And what is it?

55:02.125 --> 55:02.958
CADASIL.

55:05.916 --> 55:07.708
- Same as Mom.
- Okay.

55:12.458 --> 55:13.416
And that's, uh...

55:15.041 --> 55:17.458
That's five years on the outside.

55:18.083 --> 55:19.500
It's pretty advanced, so...

55:21.791 --> 55:22.875
It's less. Much less.

55:23.916 --> 55:27.000
You know, I knew vascular dementia
can cause hallucinations,

55:27.000 --> 55:28.500
but I just didn't think...

55:30.416 --> 55:32.166
- And nothing like this.
- Okay.

55:34.208 --> 55:35.125
Victorine.

55:35.125 --> 55:36.791
Yeah, I thought the same thing.

55:37.916 --> 55:40.666
If her contraption really works,
it could buy some time.

55:41.250 --> 55:43.958
Prevent the strokes.
Mitigate the brain damage.

55:43.958 --> 55:45.083
Good. Meds?

55:45.083 --> 55:46.458
Beta-blockers, Risperdal.

55:46.458 --> 55:50.250
Risperdal? He wants you on antipsychotics,
I'll rip his fucking throat out.

55:50.250 --> 55:52.041
Might do, frankly.

55:53.208 --> 55:57.541
I mean, tonight, what I saw,
I mean, what I saw.

55:57.541 --> 56:02.083
Victorine will get her little
heart miracle working first order.

56:05.458 --> 56:07.208
- Same as Mom.
- Stop.

56:22.333 --> 56:24.000
- Hey, what's all that...
- [thudding]

56:24.958 --> 56:26.916
[thudding intensifies]

56:46.166 --> 56:47.166
[Julius] Hey.

56:48.583 --> 56:49.583
Hey!

56:50.333 --> 56:52.541
Almost got her! [grunting]

56:53.083 --> 56:54.000
Shit!

56:54.500 --> 56:55.583
[yells]

56:56.916 --> 56:58.208
Leo, what's happening?

56:58.208 --> 57:00.666
[Leo grunting]

57:00.916 --> 57:02.958
- [frame crashes]
- If she runs, grab her!

57:02.958 --> 57:05.416
[grunting]

57:05.416 --> 57:07.291
I'm gonna flatten that cunt, I swear!

57:07.291 --> 57:08.625
[grunting]

57:17.791 --> 57:19.041
[yells]

57:19.041 --> 57:21.500
Come here! [grunts]

57:26.583 --> 57:27.500
[snarling]

57:27.500 --> 57:29.000
[screaming]

57:29.000 --> 57:30.250
What?

57:32.541 --> 57:34.166
[Leo breathing heavily]

57:34.166 --> 57:35.250
You don't see it?

58:07.208 --> 58:08.625
Stop! Stop!

58:11.791 --> 58:12.791
[body thuds]

58:33.375 --> 58:35.083
[cars honking]

58:43.750 --> 58:45.750
[cat meowing softly]

58:59.625 --> 59:01.625
[sirens approaching]
