WEBVTT

00:38.821 --> 00:40.779
NICKY.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.868
SHIFU.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.919
EVERYTHING'S BEEN
SO HARD SINCE I
LOST YOU.

00:49.919 --> 00:52.008
I DID THINGS.

00:52.008 --> 00:55.011
I SAW A PART OF MYSELF
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WAS THERE--

00:55.011 --> 00:57.013
ANGRY, CRUEL--

00:57.013 --> 00:59.189
BUT HERE...

00:59.189 --> 01:03.715
IT'S LIKE...I CAN SEE
MY MISTAKES, BUT THEY
CAN'T HURT ME.

01:03.715 --> 01:06.718
I FEEL...

01:06.718 --> 01:10.722
CALM, PEACEFUL, SAFE,

01:10.722 --> 01:15.423
LIKE THIS PLACE
WAS MADE FOR ME,
LIKE I BELONG HERE.

01:17.425 --> 01:21.820
PERHAPS THIS PLACE IS
A PART OF YOU, TOO, HMM?

01:21.820 --> 01:25.824
I AM GLAD YOU HAVE FOUND
PEACE HERE, CHILD,

01:25.824 --> 01:27.826
BUT...

01:27.826 --> 01:30.525
YOU CANNOT STAY.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.369
MEI-LI: EVAN,

01:48.369 --> 01:50.022
WHAT HAVE YOU
HEARD?

01:50.022 --> 01:53.156
THE CHARGES
ARE SERIOUS--

01:53.156 --> 01:55.158
TRESPASSING,
CYBER THEFT,

01:55.158 --> 01:57.943
AND MULTIPLE COUNTS
OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.

01:57.943 --> 02:00.294
SHE'S BEEN ARRAIGNED?

02:00.294 --> 02:02.948
BAIL'S BEEN SET?
WE CAN GET HER OUT?

02:02.948 --> 02:05.299
BAIL'S SET
AT 2.5 MILLION.

02:05.299 --> 02:08.389
TO SECURE NICKY'S
RELEASE, WE'D NEED
TO POST A 10% BOND.

02:08.389 --> 02:11.870
THAT'S A QUARTER OF
A MILLION DOLLARS.

02:11.870 --> 02:14.960
LAO GONG,
WHERE ARE WE GONNA GET
THAT KIND OF MONEY?

02:14.960 --> 02:16.962
THIS ISN'T THE NEWS
WE WANTED, I KNOW,

02:16.962 --> 02:19.139
BUT, UH, NADIA
AND I ARE GONNA
TALK TO THE D.A.,

02:19.139 --> 02:21.793
TRY AND GET HER
TO DROP THE CHARGES.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.882
THANK YOU.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.147
WE HAVE TO GET
NICKY OUT, UH,

02:27.147 --> 02:29.149
SO WHAT--YARD SALE... MMM.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.543
COUCH CUSHIONS,
AND I COULD, UM,
EMPTY PIGGY BANKS?

02:32.543 --> 02:35.546
SECOND...MORTGAGE...

02:35.546 --> 02:37.940
NICKY, VOICE-OVER:
I HAVE TO LEAVE?

02:37.940 --> 02:40.334
I JUST FOUND
THIS PLACE.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.988
ONE MUST NOT
MISTAKE STASIS

02:42.988 --> 02:45.034
FOR PEACE.

02:45.034 --> 02:47.341
YOU MUST FIND
YOUR FOOTING.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.560
HOW?
PEI-LING: BY DISCERNING

02:49.560 --> 02:52.215
WHERE YOU LOST IT.

02:52.215 --> 02:55.262
MY CHILD.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.616
WHEN YOU CAME BACK,

03:01.616 --> 03:04.053
I WAS SO HAPPY.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.055
I DIDN'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU AGAIN.

03:06.055 --> 03:08.231
I WAS SO FOCUSED
ON HOLDING ON

03:08.231 --> 03:11.234
THAT I MISSED THINGS.

03:11.234 --> 03:15.369
BO WAS...
NEW AND EXCITING.

03:15.369 --> 03:19.024
I WANTED IT SO MUCH.

03:19.024 --> 03:22.550
WHEN I FINALLY SAW
THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM,
IT WAS TOO LATE.

03:22.550 --> 03:25.205
I WAS DISTRACTED, HURTING.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.556
I'D LEFT EVERYONE
VULNERABLE, SUCCUMBED
TO VIOLENCE.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.993
THEN THERE'S DELTA
TRANSFORMING MY CITY,

03:30.993 --> 03:33.604
TARGETING ME
AND MY FAMILY.

03:33.604 --> 03:36.433
I RUSHED
AT THE PROBLEM,

03:36.433 --> 03:40.350
TRIED TO FIX IT ALL
IN A DAY, AND NOW...

03:40.350 --> 03:43.397
I KNOW WHERE I
WENT WRONG,

03:43.397 --> 03:46.530
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

03:48.315 --> 03:52.275
THERE MUST BE
A THOUSAND DOLLARS
IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

03:52.275 --> 03:55.365
OH, UH, WE GAVE
A HUNDRED TO NICKY

03:55.365 --> 03:57.019
FOR THE PLANE TICKET
TO THAILAND.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.282
MEI-LI: YES.
MAMA, BABA?

03:59.282 --> 04:01.371
WE HAVE COMPANY.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.374
OH. ALFRED, DIANA.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.898
I--I'M SORRY.
I--I SHOULD HAVE
PREPARED SOMETHING.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.160
OH, WE'RE
JUST GLAD TO SEE YOU.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.814
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

04:09.814 --> 04:12.295
MEI-LI: YEAH.
THEY'RE HERE TO HELP.

04:12.295 --> 04:15.080
OH.
MEI-LI: NO.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.995
NO, NO, WE CANNOT.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.997
MRS. SHEN,
THEY'VE ALREADY AGREED.

04:18.997 --> 04:21.086
MEI-LI: BUT...
THAT...

04:21.086 --> 04:22.479
MEI-LI: W-WE COULD
NEVER REPAY YOU.

04:22.479 --> 04:23.785
THAT'S TOO MUCH MONEY.

04:23.785 --> 04:27.005
WE DON'T EXPECT YOU TO.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.094
WE'VE BEEN ESTRANGED
TOO LONG.

04:29.094 --> 04:32.707
YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER
ARE A HUGE PART
OF OUR SON'S LIFE.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.231
YOU'RE FAMILY.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.799
PLEASE,
LET US HELP.

04:41.846 --> 04:44.414
PEI-LING:
YOU DISCOVERED THIS PLACE

04:44.414 --> 04:48.288
FOR A REASON; NOT TO
ESCAPE YOUR PROBLEMS,

04:48.288 --> 04:50.681
OR EVEN TO SOLVE THEM.

04:50.681 --> 04:53.249
DELTA, XIAO--

04:53.249 --> 04:57.645
YOU KNOW STOPPING THEM
IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY,

04:57.645 --> 05:01.301
BUT ONE CANNOT FACE
THE FUTURE

05:01.301 --> 05:04.956
WITH ONE FOOT
IN THE PAST.

05:04.956 --> 05:09.178
THERE IS ONE THING
YOU MUST DO FIRST.

05:10.614 --> 05:13.138
I HAVE TO FORGIVE MYSELF.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.097
HMM.

05:15.097 --> 05:18.448
SHIFU, I'M READY
TO FACE IT AGAIN.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.102
I'M READY TO FIGHT.

05:20.102 --> 05:24.715
SHEN.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.891
GOT SOME VISITORS.

05:26.891 --> 05:29.503
OH, NICKY.
I'M FINE, EVAN.

05:29.503 --> 05:32.549
BETTER THAN FINE.
I KNOW WHAT I
HAVE TO DO.

05:32.549 --> 05:35.509
I HAVE TO GET OUT,
GET BACK ON
THE STREETS--

05:37.119 --> 05:39.991
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
DID THE D.A. DROP
THE CHARGES?

05:39.991 --> 05:42.342
SORRY, NICKY.
SHE REFUSED.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.822
YOU MADE BAIL,
SO YOU'RE BEING
RELEASED, BUT--

05:44.822 --> 05:46.955
IT'S A CONDITIONAL
RELEASE, HOUSE ARREST.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.478
YOU'RE GOING HOME, BUT--

05:48.478 --> 05:50.219
YOU HAVE TO STAY THERE.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.670
YOU'RE ALL SET.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.589
DIANA, ARE YOU
SURE YOU WOULDN'T
LIKE MORE TEA?

06:12.589 --> 06:14.591
YEAH.
I'M FINE.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.376
THANK YOU.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.986
MR. SOONG,
MRS. SOONG,

06:17.986 --> 06:19.857
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.730
OH, OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.297
I'M JUST GLAD
YOU'RE BACK HOME,
BABY GIRL.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.387
ME, TOO. YEAH.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.738
MEI-LI: I PUT A CHANGE
OF CLOTHES ON YOUR BED
UPSTAIRS, NICKY.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.089
I CAN'T BELIEVE
NICKY'S TRAPPED HERE.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.917
WE CAN'T SPIRAL.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.919
DELTA WANTS
TO TURN OUR CITY
INTO A POLICE STATE.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.921
NICKY WANTS US TO KEEP
MOVING AGAINST THEM.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.444
STILL DIGGING
INTO DAVID WHEELER?

06:41.444 --> 06:43.185
YUP, THE HEAD
OF THE SNAKE.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.448
WE TAKE DELTA DOWN
FROM THE TOP, PUT DAVID

06:45.448 --> 06:48.059
IN LEGAL JEOPARDY,
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET
NICKY'S CHARGES REMOVED.

06:48.059 --> 06:50.671
YEAH, THAT MIGHT
BE TOUGH RIGHT NOW;
WHEELER'S OUT OF THE CITY,

06:50.671 --> 06:54.326
GETTING READY FOR
A DELTA SECURITY ENDEAVORS
ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

06:54.326 --> 06:56.416
AT THE FAMILY ESTATE.

06:58.026 --> 07:00.115
THAT EXPLAINS IT.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.726
TALKED TO AN OLD
HACKER BUDDY OF MINE,
DIGGING FOR INTEL.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.728
RUMOR HAS IT, AFTER
NICKY'S BREAK-IN,

07:04.728 --> 07:07.383
DAVID MOVED DELTA'S
MAINFRAME OFFSITE

07:07.383 --> 07:08.993
TO THE FAMILY RANCH
IN MARIN.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.473
IT'S DEFINITELY
UNDER LOCKDOWN.

07:10.473 --> 07:11.996
THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN HACK THAT.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.259
SO NICKY SPOOKED HIM.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.305
HE'S KEEPING HIS SECRETS
AND HIS MYSTERIOUS ALGORITHM
CLOSE AT HAND.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.220
COULD BE SOMETHING
WORTH HIDING, THEN.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.309
IF DELTA'S USING THIS ALGORITHM
TO STEAL PRIVATE DATA

07:20.309 --> 07:23.051
TO FRAME INNOCENT PEOPLE,
THIS COULD BE
THE SMOKING GUN WE NEED.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.793
DID SOMEONE SAY
"SMOKING GUN"?
AS YOU WERE.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.708
I DON'T NEED
A SECOND WELCOME HOME.

07:27.708 --> 07:30.624
PROMISE.
WHAT DO WE GOT?

07:30.624 --> 07:33.278
WHEELER AND HIS
SMOKING-GUN ALGORITHM
ARE OUT IN MARIN,

07:33.278 --> 07:35.106
GETTING READY
FOR THEIR ANNUAL
SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING,

07:35.106 --> 07:36.934
SO WE MAY NEED TO FIND
ANOTHER TARGET.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.589
WHY? WHY NOT
STRIKE THERE?

07:39.589 --> 07:41.286
FOR ONE THING, THE PLACE
WILL BE CRAWLING WITH GUARDS,

07:41.286 --> 07:43.027
STATE-OF-THE-ART SECURITY.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.855
BUT IT'S A PARTY,
SO OPEN TO GUESTS?

07:44.855 --> 07:47.075
BIG-TICKET INVESTORS
ONLY; MINIMUM BUY-IN

07:47.075 --> 07:49.773
FOR AN INVITE IS
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS,

07:49.773 --> 07:51.601
NOT TO MENTION
THEY'RE DEFINITELY
GONNA RUN

07:51.601 --> 07:53.429
BACKGROUND CHECKS
ON THE ENTIRE
GUEST LIST.

07:53.429 --> 07:55.257
YOU NEED SOMEONE ELSE
TO MAN THE KEYS,

07:55.257 --> 07:58.347
BUT YOU CAN DO
THAT STUFF, RIGHT?

07:58.347 --> 08:00.697
CREATE
AN ONLINE PAPER TRAIL,
GIN UP CREDENTIALS,

08:00.697 --> 08:02.960
SHELL COMPANIES,
FAKE A COVER FOR DELTA?

08:02.960 --> 08:06.486
YEAH, BUT FOR WHO? YOU?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.357
RIGHT.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.359
IF WE'RE
GONNA PULL THIS OFF
AND GET OUR HANDS

08:10.359 --> 08:12.230
ON THE ALGORITHM,
SOMEONE ELSE HAS
TO GO UNDERCOVER.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.710
INFILTRATING DELTA
ON THEIR LITERAL HOME TURF?

08:13.710 --> 08:14.972
WE'D NEED A FIGHTER.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.844
I COULD DO IT.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.499
I MEAN, I KNOW
I DON'T EXACTLY
SCREAM "MONEY."

08:19.499 --> 08:21.892
I SCREAM "MONEY."

08:23.154 --> 08:25.200
WHAT? I DO. YEAH...

08:25.200 --> 08:26.767
BUT YOU'RE A TERRIBLE LIAR.
NO. AFTER OUR BREAK-IN,

08:26.767 --> 08:28.551
DELTA MIGHT KNOW
YOUR FACE ALREADY.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.466
I WORK DOUBLE SHIFTS
ALL WEEK, BUT--

08:30.466 --> 08:32.207
I'LL DO IT.
WHAT? PEBBLES--

08:32.207 --> 08:33.991
LOOK,

08:33.991 --> 08:36.907
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO VOLUNTEER FOR THIS, BUT...

08:36.907 --> 08:38.822
I'LL DO IT.
WORKING AS A P.I.,

08:38.822 --> 08:40.607
I REALIZE I'M
A GREAT LIAR.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.957
I'M NO BUSINESS EXPERT,
BUT I KNOW ENOUGH TO BULL

08:42.957 --> 08:46.047
AND I KNOW TECH,
SO WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUALLY
STEALING THE ALGORITHM--

08:46.047 --> 08:48.658
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO
BREAK YOUR PLEA DEAL.

08:48.658 --> 08:51.008
YOU COULD GO TO PRISON.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.097
YEAH.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.186
GUYS, I THINK
IT HAS TO BE ME.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.493
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN DO THIS.

08:57.493 --> 09:00.496
OH, GOD!
UH, HELLO?

09:00.496 --> 09:04.456
DID EVERYONE FORGET
THE HALF-A-MILLION-DOLLAR
PRICE OF ADMISSION?

09:04.456 --> 09:07.285
LOOK, BIG POINTS
TO ALTHEA FOR BRAVERY,
BUT NONE OF THIS

09:07.285 --> 09:10.419
CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN,
I MEAN, UNLESS...

09:19.994 --> 09:21.561
OH, GOD.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.826
HMM.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.350
I HEARD SARAH COLLINS
DROPPED OUT.

09:28.350 --> 09:32.267
YES, SHE HAS.
COMING INTO HOMESTRETCH NOW.
IT'S BETWEEN ME AND ANTHONY.

09:32.267 --> 09:35.270
GOTTA SAY, I LIKED
SARAH'S PLATFORM.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.751
ALFRED.
WHAT?

09:37.751 --> 09:39.579
JIN KNOWS MY POLITICS.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.363
IF WE LIVED
IN THIS DISTRICT,

09:41.363 --> 09:43.365
OF COURSE I'D STILL
VOTE FOR YOU.

09:43.365 --> 09:47.369
OH, DENNIS,
YOU MUST TRY SOME
OF THIS ROU GAN.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.110
IT IS DELICIOUS.
MEI-LI: THANK YOU.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.938
I'M OK.
COULD WE TALK
IN PRIVATE?

09:50.938 --> 09:52.983
WHAT?
NO SECRETS HERE, RIGHT?

09:52.983 --> 09:54.985
IT'S ABOUT MONEY.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.987
OH. YOU MEAN
THE BAIL.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.989
NO, MOM.

09:58.989 --> 10:01.035
WE NEED MORE. UH,

10:01.035 --> 10:03.254
ALTHEA AND I HAVE TO MAKE
A LARGE INVESTMENT

10:03.254 --> 10:05.300
IN DELTA SECURITY ENDEAVORS.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.868
WELL, HOW LARGE?

10:07.868 --> 10:10.174
JUST HALF A MILLION.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.222
I'D NEED TO SPEAK
TO MY ADVISORS.

10:14.222 --> 10:17.355
I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THIS COMPANY.
I COULD LOSE EVERY CENT.

10:17.355 --> 10:21.142
YOU PROBABLY WILL;
WHEN DELTA FALLS,
THIS MONEY WILL GO WITH IT.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.144
YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE
MY WORD.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.537
DELTA'S HURTING PEOPLE,
DOING ILLEGAL STUFF.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.365
WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THEM,
TO TAKE THEM DOWN.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.367
BY GIVING THEM MONEY?
NO.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.456
WELL, YEAH.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.458
WE JUST NEED THE MONEY
TO GO UNDERCOVER,

10:33.458 --> 10:36.461
INFILTRATE THEM,
AND STEAL EVIDENCE
TO USE AGAINST THEM.

10:36.461 --> 10:39.073
I'M JUST GONNA
CLEAR THE TABLE.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.378
UH, AND LET ME HELP YOU.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.597
MEI-LI: OK.
OK.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.512
WHY DON'T YOU
SEEM SURPRISED?

10:43.512 --> 10:45.688
DID YOU TWO KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

10:45.688 --> 10:48.778
I TRIED TO BE
POLITE, NOT TO ASK
TOO MANY QUESTIONS

10:48.778 --> 10:52.739
ABOUT NICKY'S SITUATION,
BUT JUST WHAT IS GOING ON
IN THIS HOUSE?

10:52.739 --> 10:55.393
ALFRED, DIANA,

10:55.393 --> 10:57.395
UM, YOU SEE,

10:57.395 --> 11:00.355
UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,
OUR DAUGHTER--

11:00.355 --> 11:01.791
MM-HMM.
PEI-LING: WE...

11:01.791 --> 11:04.794
WE, UH, WE...

11:04.794 --> 11:06.796
WE FIGHT CRIME.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.798
MMM, YEAH.
MEI-LI: YEAH.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.540
YEAH. MM-HMM. MMM.
MEI-LI: YEAH, THAT.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.502
THANKS FOR
LEADING THE TROOPS.

11:17.502 --> 11:21.463
NO PROBLEM. I'M, UH...
HAPPY YOU'RE HOME.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.337
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS PLAN?

11:26.337 --> 11:29.340
RESERVING JUDGMENT--
- SEEING HOW
THINGS SHAPE UP.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.473
IN THE MEANTIME,
I NEED YOU WORKING
THE XIAO FRONT.

11:31.473 --> 11:33.693
WITH ALL THIS
GOING DOWN?

11:33.693 --> 11:36.260
I REALIZED SOMETHING
IN JAIL.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.480
I...GOT DISTRACTED,

11:38.480 --> 11:40.656
WAS CAUGHT OFF-GUARD,

11:40.656 --> 11:44.181
AND THEN,
I WAS SO HURT THAT...

11:46.618 --> 11:49.578
WE--WE NEED TO MOVE
FORWARD, ON ALL FRONTS.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.972
PEI-LING STILL NEEDS US.
WE HAVE TO FIND XIAO--

11:51.972 --> 11:55.802
OH, I AGREE.
YOUR BROTHER LET ME IN.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.456
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
HEARD YOU GOT ARRESTED.

11:58.456 --> 12:01.111
CAME BACK TO GLOAT. HMM.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.636
I HAVE BEEN
TRACKING XIAO.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.595
THAT PARASITIC DEMON
HAS BEEN RACKING UP

12:06.595 --> 12:09.206
SOME SERIOUS
FREQUENT FLYER POINTS.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.426
FROM MY RESEARCH AND
A FEW OF MY SOURCES,

12:11.426 --> 12:13.428
I DISCOVERED
THAT SHE WAS
IN CARTAGENA.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.343
THEN SHE WAS IN
CANBERRA, THEN AGRA.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.345
I TRIED TO KEEP UP,
BUT SHE'S TOO FAST.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.260
BY THE TIME
I PACK MY BAGS,
SHE'S ALREADY GONE.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.392
THESE CITIES--
WHAT'S THE PATTERN?

12:21.392 --> 12:23.743
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

12:25.353 --> 12:28.660
SO I THOUGHT THAT...

12:28.660 --> 12:31.663
I KNOW IT ISN'T MUCH
TO GO ON.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.709
IT'S A START.

12:35.102 --> 12:37.713
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.802
BUT WHAT ABOUT--

12:39.802 --> 12:42.022
BUSY HERE.
GOT AN EVIL CORPORATION

12:42.022 --> 12:45.373
TO TAKE DOWN,
PLUS, HOUSE ARREST.

12:45.373 --> 12:46.983
HMM.

12:46.983 --> 12:49.029
ZHILAN.
HUH?

12:49.029 --> 12:51.031
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.120
YOU, TOO.

12:57.733 --> 13:00.605
PROMISED MY PARENTS
A LONG TALK AFTER,
BUT THEY'RE IN FOR NOW.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.607
DAD'S PULLING
THE FUNDS TOGETHER.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.827
IN THE MEANTIME,
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
ON YOUR ALIAS--

13:04.827 --> 13:07.830
MADELINE JUNG, PROUD CEO
OF ICARUS STRATEGIES.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.832
ICARUS? DIDN'T HE
BURN TO DEATH?

13:09.832 --> 13:12.835
NO. HIS WINGS MELTED OFF,
FELL OUT OF THE SKY,
AND DROWNED.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.837
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. SORRY.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.492
NAME ALREADY CLEARED.
ICARUS STRATEGIES IS

13:17.492 --> 13:20.321
AN INTERNATIONAL
CONSULTING FIRM
OFFERING SIMPLE SOLUTIONS

13:20.321 --> 13:23.324
TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS
IN THE POLITICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL,

13:23.324 --> 13:25.935
AND ECONOMIC SPACE.
IMPRESSIVELY VAGUE.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.590
NADIA'S PRINTING
SOME ICARUS BUSINESS CARDS,
AND I'VE GOT AN EX-COP FRIEND

13:28.590 --> 13:30.287
WORKING ON
MADELINE JUNG I.D.s.

13:30.287 --> 13:32.202
AND I'M CREATING
AN ICARUS WEBSITE,

13:32.202 --> 13:34.248
PLANTING NEWS STORIES
ABOUT YOU
AND THE COMPANY.

13:34.248 --> 13:35.989
I'LL NEED SOME HELP
FAKE-BACKDATING THEM.

13:35.989 --> 13:39.079
OK. SO, WHAT EXACTLY
IS MADELINE WALKING
INTO HERE?

13:39.079 --> 13:41.081
WELL, THANKS
TO YOUR HACKING TIPS,

13:41.081 --> 13:43.083
I MANAGED TO GET AHOLD
OF DELTA'S GUEST LIST.

13:43.083 --> 13:46.086
THERE'S NO MAJOR
RED FLAGS THERE, JUST
A LOTTA DEEP POCKETS,

13:46.086 --> 13:48.871
BUT THERE WAS ONE NAME
THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME--

13:48.871 --> 13:51.178
MATTHEW WHEELER.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.310
DAVID'S BROTHER. RIGHT.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.835
MATT'S BEEN WITH DELTA
SINCE DAY ONE,

13:55.835 --> 13:58.881
BUT HIS ROLE AT THE COMPANY
IS STRANGELY UNDEFINED,

13:58.881 --> 14:01.318
AND DESPITE BEING
EQUAL PARTNERS FINANCIALLY,

14:01.318 --> 14:03.843
HE NEVER DOES
ANY PRESS AND HE
NEVER GETS ANY CREDIT.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.322
SO?

14:05.322 --> 14:07.847
SO THERE'S A THEORY
ONLINE THAT MATT IS

14:07.847 --> 14:10.458
THE REAL GENIUS BEHIND
ALL OF DELTA'S TECHNOLOGY.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.200
IT'S JUST A THEORY,

14:13.200 --> 14:16.203
THEIR BIOS, THEIR EDUCATION,
THEIR MILITARY SERVICE.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.640
MATT'S GOT A Ph.D.
IN MATHEMATICS
FROM M.I.T.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.382
AND WORKED
IN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE,
WHEREAS EVERYTHING

14:21.382 --> 14:23.645
ON DAVID'S CV
IS PURE BUSINESS,
ALL THE WAY DOWN.

14:23.645 --> 14:26.039
SO, DAVID,
THE SO-CALLED ARCHITECT

14:26.039 --> 14:28.476
OF DELTA SECURITY
ENDEAVORS, ISN'T EVEN
THE REAL ARCHITECT?

14:28.476 --> 14:31.087
I THINK SO.

14:31.087 --> 14:33.524
I CAN USE THAT.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.918
IF WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO PULL THIS OFF,

14:35.918 --> 14:38.442
WE'RE GONNA NEED
SOME SORT OF ANGLE,
A LEVER.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.662
MATTHEW'S BEEN WORKING
IN DAVID'S SHADOW
FOR DECADES,

14:40.662 --> 14:42.664
WATCHING HIM HOG
THE SPOTLIGHT, KNOWING
THIS WHOLE TIME

14:42.664 --> 14:44.927
THAT HE'S
THE REAL GENIUS?

14:44.927 --> 14:47.103
AS A TECHIE,
I KNOW THAT GIVING UP
AUTHORSHIP IS HARD.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.018
HE MUST HAVE A TON
OF RESENTMENT.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.020
IF MATTHEW'S
THE REAL BRAINS
BEHIND DELTA'S TECH

14:51.020 --> 14:53.240
AND WE CAN LEVERAGE
THAT RESENTMENT,
MATTHEW MIGHT BE

14:53.240 --> 14:55.111
OUR BEST SHOT
AT GETTING
THE ALGORITHM.

14:55.111 --> 14:56.765
WHAT WAS THAT
ABOUT MILITARY SERVICE?

14:56.765 --> 14:58.941
UH, BOTH BROTHERS
WERE IN THE NAVY;

14:58.941 --> 15:01.465
DAVID WAS A SEAL,
AND MATT WAS IN--

15:01.465 --> 15:03.554
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE?
YEAH, GOT IT.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.122
THESE ARE THE GUYS
WE'RE SENDING ALTHEA
TO INFILTRATE?

15:06.122 --> 15:08.733
NICKY AND HENRY OFFSITE,
NO ONE TO DEFEND YOU
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

15:08.733 --> 15:11.040
I KNOW, DENNIS,
BUT I TOLD YOU--

15:11.040 --> 15:13.869
NO, HE'S RIGHT.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.958
I'VE BEEN IN DANGEROUS
SITUATIONS BEFORE.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.873
I WAS JUST KIDNAPPED
BY A MERCENARY.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.701
THAT WAS DIFFERENT.
THIS IS A CHOICE.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.311
I KNOW, NICKY.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.313
MY CHOICE.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.489
I SEE IT IN MY HEAD,
EVERY STEP.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.709
I'M--I'M TERRIFIED,
BUT I'M EXCITED.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.016
I CAN DO THIS.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.061
YEAH, BUT YOU--
BUT WHAT?

15:32.061 --> 15:34.672
BECAUSE I'M NOT
A FIGHTER?

15:34.672 --> 15:37.023
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW
OUR TRAINING FELL OFF,

15:37.023 --> 15:39.416
BUT I'M NOT
ENTIRELY DEFENSELESS.

15:39.416 --> 15:42.463
YOU MEAN THAT ONE THIEF
YOU KICKED THAT ONE TIME?

15:42.463 --> 15:45.379
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT.
IT WAS A REALLY GOOD KICK.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.339
I JUST----

15:49.339 --> 15:51.341
I FEEL WEIRD.

15:51.341 --> 15:53.996
I WAS SO READY
TO TAKE ON DELTA

15:53.996 --> 15:56.607
AND BE THE WARRIOR,
BUT I DIDN'T THINK I'D

15:56.607 --> 16:00.002
BE PUTTING YOU IN DANGER
WITHOUT ME THERE.

16:00.002 --> 16:03.397
YOU'LL BE ON COMMS
WITH ME THE WHOLE TIME.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.399
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I
BEEN IN YOUR EAR,

16:05.399 --> 16:07.401
LEADING YOU THROUGH
THE MISSIONS?

16:07.401 --> 16:09.620
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.622
YOU'VE GOTTA
TRUST ME,

16:11.622 --> 16:14.321
THE WAY WE
ALWAYS TRUST YOU...

16:15.931 --> 16:18.064
HMM?
TSK.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.066
SO, MADELINE,

16:20.066 --> 16:23.808
ARE YOU A...NEUTRAL
OR A SMOKEY EYE?

16:25.506 --> 16:29.031
ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO...

16:30.902 --> 16:32.861
MADELINE JUNG.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.776
OH, WOW.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.996
OHH.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.303
SO,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:40.303 --> 16:43.524
INCREDIBLE.

16:43.524 --> 16:46.092
BUT YOU STILL
KINDA LOOK LIKE ALTHEA.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.180
YEAH.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.051
OH.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.053
ALMOST FORGOT.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.360
HMM?
HOW 'BOUT NOW?

16:53.360 --> 16:55.579
UH...
MEI-LI: UH-HUH.

16:58.191 --> 17:01.716
UH, ARE WE SURE
ABOUT THIS, NICKY?

17:01.716 --> 17:04.023
ALTHEA'S GOT THIS.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.897
OK.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.524
OH.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.526
YOU WERE RIGHT.

17:29.526 --> 17:32.268
THIS VIBE IS DEFINITELY
MORE SUNDANCE THAN DAVOS.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.315
IDENTIFICATION,
PLEASE.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.230
OH. YES.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.928
AHEM.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.454
DON'T SEE YOU
ON THE LIST.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.108
YOU DON'T?

17:46.108 --> 17:49.111
UH...
I'M A NEW INVESTOR.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.070
DECIDED TO JOIN
LAST MINUTE.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.246
PERHAPS...

17:53.246 --> 17:55.770
AH. AH, RIGHT.
HERE YOU ARE.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.772
WELCOME TO
WHEELER ESTATE,
MS. JUNG.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.469
MMM.

18:03.386 --> 18:06.520
OH...GOD, OH, GOD, OH, GOD,
OH, GOD, OH, GOD, OH, GOD.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.827
WHAT'S THE VIBE?

18:09.827 --> 18:13.353
VERY CLUBBY,
LIKE EVERYONE KNOWS
EACH OTHER.

18:13.353 --> 18:16.573
FAKE IDENTITY,
NO SOCIAL CONNECTIONS.

18:16.573 --> 18:19.010
I'M KIND OF
STICKING OUT HERE.

18:19.010 --> 18:21.012
WELL, STAY CALM.
MATT IS YOUR TARGET.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.232
ANY SIGHT OF HIM?

18:25.191 --> 18:27.280
IT'S HIM.
MATT?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.804
DAVID.
OK, DON'T ENGAGE.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.806
IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK.

18:31.806 --> 18:34.069
HELLO...DAVID.

18:34.069 --> 18:37.420
MADELINE JUNG,
ICARUS STRATEGIES?

18:37.420 --> 18:40.031
THAT IS ME.
YES, YES, YES. HEH!

18:40.031 --> 18:41.946
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I HAD NEVER HEARD

18:41.946 --> 18:44.558
OF ICARUS UNTIL
YOUR RECENT INVESTMENT,

18:44.558 --> 18:46.560
SO I READ
SOME ARTICLES ONLINE.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.170
PRETTY INTERESTING STUFF.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.780
"INTERESTING"? OH.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.087
WE ALL KNOW THAT'S CODE
FOR "YOU DON'T GET IT."

18:52.087 --> 18:54.263
LISTEN,

18:54.263 --> 18:56.265
I'D GIVE YOU MY PITCH
AND MAKE A BELIEVER OF YOU

18:56.265 --> 18:58.441
IN MINUTES, BUT THAT'S
NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.965
THIS WEEKEND IS
ALL ABOUT DELTA.

19:00.965 --> 19:04.230
WELL, YES,
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.754
PLEASURE MEETING YOU,
MADELINE. I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE BLIND.

19:06.754 --> 19:09.104
WELL DONE, ALTHEA.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.802
"SEE YOU AT THE BLIND"?
WHAT IS THAT,
SOME SORT OF RIDDLE?

19:11.802 --> 19:13.804
HELLO.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.241
WELCOME TO THE FESTIVITIES.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.199
AS DELTA'S PARTNERS
AND INVESTORS,

19:17.199 --> 19:19.984
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL EAGER
TO HEAR ABOUT OUR SUCCESS

19:19.984 --> 19:22.596
IN SAN FRANCISCO
AND OUR PLANS TO EXPAND

19:22.596 --> 19:24.902
OUR PROGRAMS AND
OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY

19:24.902 --> 19:27.035
INTO CITIES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

19:27.035 --> 19:30.038
BUT THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME FOR THAT.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.648
FIRST...

19:31.648 --> 19:34.260
LET'S CUT
TO THE GOOD PART.

19:38.438 --> 19:41.136
MINE.
OH, THAT ONE'S MINE.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.747
THANK YOU.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.445
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

19:45.445 --> 19:47.838
I HAVE NO IDEA. WAIT.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.797
"THE BLIND"?
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT...?

19:52.365 --> 19:54.149
HUNTING?

19:54.149 --> 19:57.152
I MEAN, HUNTING?
YAY.

19:57.152 --> 20:00.068
ALL RIGHT,
GRAB YOUR RIFLES,
HEAD OUT BACK,

20:00.068 --> 20:02.592
AND OUR STAFF WILL TAKE YOU
TO YOUR DESIGNATED BLINDS.
AND REMEMBER,

20:02.592 --> 20:06.857
HAVE FUN, GOOD LUCK,
AND THE BIGGEST BUCK WINS.

20:06.857 --> 20:09.469
OK.

20:09.469 --> 20:12.123
"BUCK" MEANS "DEER."
"DEER" MEANS--

20:12.123 --> 20:14.125
DON'T.

20:14.125 --> 20:17.303
BAMBI. NICKY, I AM NOT
SHOOTING A BAMBI.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.957
M-MAYBE YOU COULD
JUST FIRE AND MISS?

20:26.355 --> 20:28.792
I SEE MATTHEW.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.533
APPROACHING.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.275
ARE YOU
REALLY NOT COMING?

20:33.275 --> 20:35.103
WOULD IT KILL YOU
JUST TO PLAY ALONG,

20:35.103 --> 20:36.322
AT LEAST WHILE
THE BIG FISH ARE HERE?

20:36.322 --> 20:37.497
LIKE THEY CARE.

20:37.497 --> 20:38.715
THEY BARELY KNOW WHO I AM.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.674
YOU'VE MADE SURE OF THAT.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.589
FINE. GO SULK IN YOUR ROOM.
BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU ASK

20:42.589 --> 20:44.895
WHY I'M THE FACE OF
THE COMPANY AND YOU'RE
NOT, THIS IS WHY.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.680
GOOD LUCK IF ANY OF
THE BIG FISH

20:46.680 --> 20:48.247
ASK YOU ANY REAL
QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR TECH.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.552
I'M TAKING THE JET
BACK TO NEW YORK

20:49.552 --> 20:51.032
FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.729
AFTER TONIGHT,
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.647
UH, MS. JUNG.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.301
CARE TO JOIN? BLIND 5.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.824
FIGURED I'D GIVE YOU
A CHANCE TO PITCH ME.

21:00.824 --> 21:03.262
OH, DAVID, I WOULD LOVE TO.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.916
UM, WELL, YOU SEE,
I CAN'T JOIN THE HUNT.

21:05.916 --> 21:08.310
I'M, UM...

21:08.310 --> 21:09.703
ALLERGIC.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.792
ALLERGIC? TO?

21:11.792 --> 21:14.795
DEER, ELK,
AND ANTELOPE, TOO.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.318
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING
WITH ANTLERS.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.928
I JUST GET NEAR THEM,
AND MY FACE JUST...

21:19.147 --> 21:20.975
AND MY ARMS,
HIVES EVERYWHERE.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.455
SOMETIMES I VOMIT.

21:22.455 --> 21:23.673
OH.

21:23.673 --> 21:25.327
IT'S SUCH A SHAME.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.286
I LOVE TO HUNT.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.375
PHEASANT, DUCKS, BOARS.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.377
TAG 'EM AND BAG 'EM,
YOU KNOW? HA HA.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.813
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.162
WE'LL MISS YOU.

21:42.953 --> 21:45.260
CONTACTA
ENERGY SOLUTIONS.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.262
XIAO'S RECENT MOVEMENTS.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.133
CONTACTA HAS OPERATIONS
IN THESE 3 CITIES.

21:49.133 --> 21:51.222
THEY'RE MAJOR CITIES.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.312
I'M SURE THERE'S TONS OF
OTHER COMPANIES THAT
HAVE LOCATIONS THERE.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.357
I ALSO DID A PROXIMITY CHECK.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.794
I USED YOUR INTEL TO MAP OUT
XIAO'S EXACT COORDINATES.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.796
ALL 3 OF HER LOCATIONS WERE

21:59.796 --> 22:02.495
WITHIN A ONE-MILE RADIUS OF
A CONTACTA ENERGY SOLUTIONS OUTPOST.

22:02.495 --> 22:03.931
I DON'T THINK IT'S
A COINCIDENCE.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.454
ALL RIGHT. SOLD.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.021
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST THE BOOKS GUY.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.849
BUT WHAT WAS XIAO
DOING THERE?

22:08.849 --> 22:11.591
WHAT DOES SHE CARE ABOUT
"EMERGING ENERGY SOLUTIONS

22:11.591 --> 22:14.158
FOR A CLEANER,
BRIGHTER FUTURE"?

22:14.158 --> 22:15.856
THAT'S JUST SPIN.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.901
CONTACTA'S STILL IN COAL,
GAS, RARE ELEMENTS.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.686
THEY'VE GOT A JILLION
MINING SITES
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.557
SHE MUST BE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.559
OR SHE'S DOING RECON--
PULLING STRINGS,

22:23.559 --> 22:26.693
PLANNING A MOVE ON SOME
OTHER CONTACTA OPERATION.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.696
SHAANXI PROVINCE.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.654
WHAT ABOUT IT?

22:31.654 --> 22:33.352
XIAO TRAVELED THERE
THE LAST YEAR
OF HER LIFE.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.831
I READ IT IN A HISTORY
OF THE FIRST EMPEROR.

22:34.831 --> 22:37.094
WAIT. WHAT, A BOOK?

22:38.835 --> 22:40.446
I HAVE AMASSED A TON OF
RESEARCH ON XIAO,

22:40.446 --> 22:42.535
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU HAVE, TOO.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.928
AH, SO YOU WANT
TO HIT THE BOOKS.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.495
I WOULD LIKE
TO SWAP RESOURCES,

22:46.495 --> 22:48.932
GET SOME FRESH EYES
ON OUR HISTORY.

22:48.932 --> 22:51.108
I THINK THE ANSWER TO
WHAT SHE'S LOOKING FOR

22:51.108 --> 22:53.197
MIGHT BE IN HER PAST.

22:53.197 --> 22:55.722
I'LL SHOW YOU MINE
IF YOU SHOW ME YOURS.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.033
150-POUND WHITETAIL. WENT
DOWN LIKE A SACK OF BRICKS.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.426
AIN'T SHE A BEAUTY?

23:04.426 --> 23:07.037
MM-HMM. YOU SHOWED HER.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.912
ANY LUCK FINDING MATT

23:11.912 --> 23:13.522
OR WHERE THEY MIGHT BE
KEEPING THE ALGORITHM?

23:13.522 --> 23:15.481
HE'S BEEN
IN HIS ROOM ALL DAY.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.483
CAN YOU MAKE YOUR PLAY
AT DINNER?

23:17.483 --> 23:19.876
NOT LIKELY. SAW
THE SEATING CHART.

23:19.876 --> 23:22.662
WE'RE MILES APART,
IF HE EVEN SHOWS.

23:22.662 --> 23:25.273
HE LEAVES TOMORROW.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.362
I'M TRYING MY BEST HERE,
BUT I'M COMING UP SHORT,

23:27.362 --> 23:28.885
AND WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.800
HEY, WE CALLING IT?

23:30.800 --> 23:32.933
LET ME SEE THOSE
MADELINE JUNG BIOS.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.388
OK, ALTHEA, WE'RE
SENDING A BACKUP PLAN.

23:53.388 --> 23:54.955
JUST HOLD TIGHT.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.131
YOUR USUAL, SIR?

24:01.396 --> 24:03.398
MATTHEW, RIGHT?

24:03.398 --> 24:04.791
MADELINE JUNG.

24:04.791 --> 24:07.576
I NOTICED YOU BAILED
ON HUNTING. ME, TOO.

24:07.576 --> 24:08.838
I DESPISE IT.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.405
SUCH A GRISLY SPORT.

24:10.405 --> 24:13.234
I LOVE HUNTING...ALONE.

24:13.234 --> 24:17.673
SORRY. I'M NOT
BIG ON SMALL TALK.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.501
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
A WHEELER TO SCHMOOZE,

24:19.501 --> 24:21.329
TRY MY BROTHER.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.638
STRIKE 3.

24:25.638 --> 24:26.813
HANG TIGHT, ALTHEA.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.597
MADELINE.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.949
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

24:32.949 --> 24:34.560
OH, WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

24:34.560 --> 24:36.518
I'M PUTTING A STOP TO
WHATEVER THIS IS.

24:40.696 --> 24:43.525
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT REPRESENTING
OUR COMPANY ALONE.

24:43.525 --> 24:46.136
UH, IT'S MY COMPANY, TERESA,

24:46.136 --> 24:48.225
BUILT ON MY IDEAS,

24:48.225 --> 24:49.313
MY WORK, MY TECH.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.054
WITHOUT ME AT THE HELM,

24:51.054 --> 24:53.666
ICARUS NEVER WOULD'VE
GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND,

24:53.666 --> 24:55.406
AND YOU KNOW IT.

24:55.406 --> 24:56.886
I...I...

24:56.886 --> 24:58.105
"I...I..."

24:58.105 --> 25:00.237
JUST PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

25:00.237 --> 25:03.545
WE'VE GOT ALL WEEKEND
TO CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.068
THAT'S RIGHT, SISTER.

25:05.068 --> 25:08.158
I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

25:11.988 --> 25:14.077
DID ZHILAN JUST HIT YOU?

25:14.077 --> 25:18.429
NICKY, THIS BETTER
BE WORTH IT.

25:23.434 --> 25:26.350
♪ GOING NOWHERE

25:26.350 --> 25:28.962
♪ 'CAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE
WE GOT TO BE... ♪

25:30.746 --> 25:32.574
I'M STILL MAD
AT ZHILAN.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.315
THE SLAP?

25:34.315 --> 25:36.578
THE PONCHO.
SHE OUT-DRESSED ME.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.755
MS. JUNG? SORRY.
WERE YOU ON A CALL?

25:39.755 --> 25:43.629
OH, THAT. UH, NO. I WAS
JUST TALKING TO MYSELF.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.195
BAD HABIT.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.720
I THOUGHT YOU
COULD USE THIS.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.026
THANK YOU.

25:50.026 --> 25:52.202
SORRY I WAS RUDE EARLIER.

25:52.202 --> 25:55.336
THESE EVENTS BRING OUT
THE WORST IN ME.

25:57.468 --> 25:59.035
BEEN A WHILE SINCE
I'VE SEEN SOMEONE
TAKE A HIT LIKE THAT.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.994
I HOPE YOU WERE THE ONE
THROWING IT.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.343
TAKING IT, SADLY.

26:02.343 --> 26:03.605
HMM. RIVAL?

26:03.605 --> 26:05.215
SIBLING.

26:05.215 --> 26:07.522
SAME DIFFERENCE, RIGHT?

26:10.090 --> 26:11.744
WAS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?

26:11.744 --> 26:13.310
HMM? IT SEEMS
TO BE WORKING.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.182
SLAP ASIDE, THANK YOU.

26:15.182 --> 26:17.401
I ACTUALLY FEEL
A LOT BETTER

26:17.401 --> 26:19.012
HAVING YOU THERE
TO KEEP HER SAFE.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.404
YEAH, YEAH.

26:20.404 --> 26:22.058
I'LL PROTECT HER
WITH MY LIFE,

26:22.058 --> 26:23.712
BUT YOU OWE ME.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.584
THIS COMPANY,
THESE PEOPLE.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.629
YOUR CITY'S PROBLEMS
MEAN NOTHING TO ME.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.413
I KNOW. HENRY'S
WORKING ON XIAO.

26:29.413 --> 26:30.980
WE WILL FIND HER.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.634
HELLO, DAVID. HELLO.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.070
THE CEO.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.724
DAVID?
WHAT'S HE DOING?

26:35.724 --> 26:38.118
WATCHING YOUR SISTER
WORK HIS BROTHER.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.685
HE DOES NOT
LOOK PLEASED.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.425
AND ONCE WE RELEASED
THE BETA,

26:41.425 --> 26:42.862
I KNEW IT WAS
GONNA BE A HIT.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.646
THE UNDERLYING SOURCE CODE,
THE PLATFORM.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.213
IT WAS TOO GOOD TO FAIL.

26:46.213 --> 26:48.694
AND THAT WAS
THE BEGINNING OF ICARUS.

26:48.694 --> 26:51.784
SORRY. DID THAT SOUND
LIKE I WAS BRAGGING?

26:51.784 --> 26:54.569
NO. IT SOUNDED IMPRESSIVE.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.484
OH, IT'S NOTHING COMPARED
TO WHAT YOU DO.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.573
WHAT I DO?
NEVER MIND.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.096
I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T--

27:00.096 --> 27:04.187
WELL, TO BE HONEST,
I'M NOT JUST AN INVESTOR.

27:04.187 --> 27:07.669
I'M ALSO A FAN. HEH!

27:07.669 --> 27:08.844
A FAN OF ME?

27:08.844 --> 27:10.933
IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

27:10.933 --> 27:13.588
YOU'RE THE REAL GENIUS
BEHIND DELTA?

27:15.198 --> 27:16.896
OH, IT'S OK.
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE.

27:16.896 --> 27:19.420
I'M BASICALLY IN
THE SAME SITUATION.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.596
MY SISTER HAS HER CLAWS
IN WHAT I CREATE,

27:21.596 --> 27:23.380
TAKING CONTROL,
TAKING CREDIT.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.774
I BUILT EVERYTHING,
AND I OWN NOTHING.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.952
TRUTH IS, I CAME HERE
ALONE THIS WEEKEND

27:29.952 --> 27:33.739
BECAUSE I WANTED TO PRETEND.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.523
EVEN FOR JUST ONE WEEKEND,

27:35.523 --> 27:37.438
I WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT IT FELT LIKE

27:37.438 --> 27:39.222
TO LIVE OUTSIDE
OF HER SHADOW.

27:39.222 --> 27:41.877
IT'S SILLY.

27:41.877 --> 27:45.141
I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU FEEL.

27:45.141 --> 27:46.665
YOU DO?

27:46.665 --> 27:48.579
JUST A MOMENT.

27:48.579 --> 27:49.929
DAVID WHEELER.
HMM?

27:49.929 --> 27:51.800
TERESA JUNG,
ICARUS SOLUTIONS.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.323
UH, HELLO.

27:53.323 --> 27:56.065
OH. YOU, UH,
MET MY SISTER.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.981
WELL, OH. EXCUSE ME.
THANK YOU.

27:58.981 --> 28:01.854
IT'S TIME TO MEET
THE REAL POWER.

28:03.594 --> 28:05.248
IT'S A DEVIL'S BARGAIN.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.728
I ACCEPTED IT BECAUSE
THERE WERE

28:06.728 --> 28:08.208
PARTS OF THE JOB
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO,

28:08.208 --> 28:09.731
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
I'D END UP HERE.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.428
I'M ABOUT TO CHANGE
THE WORLD,

28:11.428 --> 28:12.821
AND HE'LL GET
ALL THE CREDIT.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.475
CHANGE THE WORLD?

28:14.475 --> 28:17.043
I CREATED SOMETHING,
AN ALGORITHM.

28:17.043 --> 28:19.610
DELTA'S ALREADY USING IT.
IT'S GONNA BE HUGE.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.397
BUT NOBODY WILL KNOW
IT'S MINE.

28:23.397 --> 28:25.573
I'LL KNOW.

28:25.573 --> 28:28.402
I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE
ABOUT YOUR ALGORITHM--

28:28.402 --> 28:31.100
KNOW HOW IT WORKS,
SEE YOUR GENIUS UP CLOSE.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.668
I KNOW YOU CAN'T. YOUR
BROTHER WOULDN'T APPROVE.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.975
BUT AT LEAST YOU KNOW
I'M OUT THERE.

28:35.975 --> 28:37.846
I KNOW WHO REALLY BUILT--

28:37.846 --> 28:40.066
I'LL SHOW YOU.
SCREW DAVID.

28:40.066 --> 28:41.937
I WANT YOU TO SEE IT.

28:41.937 --> 28:44.026
DESPITE
THE FIRM HAND I TAKE,

28:44.026 --> 28:46.028
SHE IS JUST, HEH,
A DEAR, FRAGILE GIRL,

28:46.028 --> 28:48.291
A BABE IN THE WOODS.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.729
YOU KNOW, SHE'S
ILL-EQUIPPED TO FLY SOLO.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.339
I DON'T KNOW, TERESA.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.776
YOUR SISTER SEEMS TO BE
FLYING SOLO JUST FINE.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.647
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.694
I ALSO HAVE A FRAGILE SIBLING
THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AFTER.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.652
WE NEED
TO BE CAREFUL.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.263
NO ONE CAN KNOW.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.439
WAIT 20 MINUTES, AND
MEET ME IN THE STUDY.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.660
GOOD NIGHT, BROTHER.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.580
SHE WILL BE
OUT OF MY SIGHT.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.452
I'VE GOT THIS.

29:18.452 --> 29:19.540
WHAT IF IT'S A TRAP?

29:19.540 --> 29:21.542
I KNOW HE'S NOT LYING.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.239
I SAW THE LOOK IN HIS EYES.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.154
TIME'S UP. HE'S WAITING.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.939
ZHILAN?

29:26.939 --> 29:28.505
SHE WANTS ME
TO HANG BACK,
I'LL HANG BACK.

29:28.505 --> 29:29.724
I'LL STAY HERE.
I'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT.

29:29.724 --> 29:30.769
I'LL RUSH IN
IF NEEDED.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.422
ALTHEA?

29:32.422 --> 29:35.295
I KNOW, NICKY.
I'LL BE CAREFUL.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.312
YOU CAME. OH.

29:52.312 --> 29:53.835
ARE YOU SURE
NO ONE SAW YOU?

29:53.835 --> 29:55.576
NOT A SOUL.

29:55.576 --> 29:59.362
YOU READY TO SEE
MY GENIUS UP CLOSE?

29:59.362 --> 30:02.670
SO...WHERE IS IT?

30:04.803 --> 30:07.240
LIFTED THE SOURCE CODE
FROM THE SERVER FILE.

30:07.240 --> 30:11.070
A PERFECT COPY OF
THE ALGORITHM.

30:11.070 --> 30:13.028
OH, WOW.

30:13.028 --> 30:16.727
I'M NOT ACTUALLY SURE
I KNOW WHAT IT DOES.

30:16.727 --> 30:21.080
MY ALGORITHM FUSES THE LATEST
IN SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY

30:21.080 --> 30:23.909
WITH MY OWN ADVANCED MODEL
OF CONSUMER PROFILING

30:23.909 --> 30:26.694
TO CREATE
A DATA-MINING BEAST.

30:26.694 --> 30:29.958
IT CAN JUMP FIREWALLS,
HOP OVER ANY KNOWN
PRIVACY BARRIER,

30:29.958 --> 30:33.440
SLURPING UP INFORMATION
ON EVERY SINGLE PERSON
ON THE PLANET--

30:33.440 --> 30:37.139
PERSONAL, BIOMETRIC,
CONSUMER, FINANCIAL DATA

30:37.139 --> 30:42.188
INTO A LIVING, BREATHING,
EVER-GROWING TAPESTRY.

30:42.188 --> 30:45.669
IN TIME, IT'LL KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYONE.

30:45.669 --> 30:47.846
TO DO WHAT?

30:47.846 --> 30:50.631
DELTA'S USING IT
FOR PREDICTIVE POLICING.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.938
DAVID WANTS TO TRANSFORM
AND PRIVATIZE

30:52.938 --> 30:54.896
THE ENTIRE
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

30:54.896 --> 30:56.811
BUT THE APPLICATIONS
ARE LIMITLESS.

30:56.811 --> 30:58.378
PRETTY AWESOME, RIGHT?

30:58.378 --> 30:59.945
WHEN WORD GETS OUT,

30:59.945 --> 31:02.817
EVERY CITY AND AUTHORITARIAN
REGIME ON THE PLANET

31:02.817 --> 31:04.906
IS GONNA WANT A PIECE.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.735
AND WITH THIS COPY OF
THE ALGORITHM IN OUR HANDS,

31:07.735 --> 31:09.998
WE CAN SELL IT
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.131
WE?

31:12.131 --> 31:14.133
I WANT TO SHARE MY CREATION

31:14.133 --> 31:16.570
WITH SOMEONE WHO
TRULY APPRECIATES IT,

31:16.570 --> 31:19.616
AND I KNOW THAT PERSON
IS YOU.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.314
THE JET'S WAITING.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.751
WE'RE LEAVING TONIGHT.

31:25.405 --> 31:28.103
WOW.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.761
MATTHEW, THIS IS SO--

31:33.761 --> 31:35.502
FAST. I KNOW. I KNOW.

31:35.502 --> 31:38.070
BUT...

31:38.070 --> 31:39.767
TALKING TO YOU TONIGHT,
IT'S LIKE,

31:39.767 --> 31:41.377
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON

31:41.377 --> 31:43.118
THAT'S EVER REALLY
UNDERSTOOD ME.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.685
MADELINE,
WE'RE THE SAME.

31:44.685 --> 31:46.165
WE WANT

31:46.165 --> 31:48.341
TO STEP OUT OF
OUR SIBLING'S SHADOW.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.038
WE'VE BEEN LIVING
UNDER THEIR THUMB

31:50.038 --> 31:51.735
OUR ENTIRE LIVES.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.302
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

31:53.302 --> 31:54.564
LET'S DO IT.

31:54.564 --> 31:56.784
LET'S RUN AWAY TOGETHER.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.873
I...

31:58.873 --> 32:00.440
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.963
THE ALGORITHM
IS RIGHT THERE.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.312
OK. WHAT'S SHE
SUPPOSED TO DO,

32:03.312 --> 32:04.574
RIP IT OUT
OF HIS HANDS?

32:04.574 --> 32:05.924
NO, IT'S TOO RISKY.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.403
ALTHEA, WE HAVE
TO REGROUP.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.970
FIND A WAY TO GET
OUT OF THERE.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.711
CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE?

32:10.711 --> 32:12.495
I'M DEFINITELY INTRIGUED,

32:12.495 --> 32:14.715
BUT I SHOULD AT LEAST
GO AND PACK MY BAG.

32:14.715 --> 32:17.631
NO, I TOOK CARE OF IT.
THEY'RE ALREADY
ON THE PLANE.

32:17.631 --> 32:20.155
ZHILAN,
HEAD TO THE STUDY.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.461
ALTHEA'S IN TROUBLE.

32:21.461 --> 32:23.071
COPY.

32:23.071 --> 32:25.552
OH. DAVID, HELLO.

32:25.552 --> 32:27.075
HELLO, ZHILAN.

32:27.075 --> 32:29.208
PULLED YOUR PRINTS
FROM YOUR WINE GLASS

32:29.208 --> 32:31.123
AND HAD MY TEAM
RUN THEM FOR ME.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.777
THE LATE INVESTMENT,
YOUR LATE ARRIVAL.

32:33.777 --> 32:36.171
YOUR SISTER PLAYING
THE DAMSEL,

32:36.171 --> 32:37.999
CASTING A SPELL
ON MY BROTHER.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.436
DELTA'S ONLY SURVIVED
AS LONG AS IT HAS

32:40.436 --> 32:43.004
BECAUSE I KNOW
MY BROTHER'S
AN EASY MARK,

32:43.004 --> 32:46.486
AND I HAVE LEARNED
TO SNIFF OUT A CON
A MILE OFF.

32:46.486 --> 32:49.010
WHERE IS YOUR SISTER,
BY THE WAY?

32:49.010 --> 32:51.578
HMM. OFF TO BED.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.362
UH-HUH. SEND A TEAM
FOR MADELINE.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.016
KEEP HER AWAY
FROM MY BROTHER.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.279
AS FOR HER,
MAKE HER DISAPPEAR.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.501
COME ON.

33:01.501 --> 33:02.850
OH, WAIT.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.156
UH, LONG FLIGHT
TO NEW YORK.

33:04.156 --> 33:05.418
I NEED TO USE
THE BATHROOM.

33:05.418 --> 33:06.680
WE HAVE ONE ON THE PLANE.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.377
OK, ALTHEA,
YOU'VE BEEN MADE.

33:08.377 --> 33:09.988
YOU NEED TO GET
OUT OF THERE NOW.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.164
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

33:12.164 --> 33:13.861
NO, NO, NO, NO. I, UM...

33:13.861 --> 33:15.732
ALTHEA.

33:19.432 --> 33:21.216
MADELINE?

33:21.216 --> 33:22.522
SORRY.

33:22.522 --> 33:23.610
UH!

33:25.090 --> 33:27.005

37:34.034 --> 37:35.122
D.A. URSILLO.

37:35.122 --> 37:37.646
GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

37:37.646 --> 37:38.908
MR. HARTLEY.

37:38.908 --> 37:40.475
NADIA,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

37:40.475 --> 37:43.565
WHAT IS THIS?

37:43.565 --> 37:46.829
EVERYTHING YOU NEED...

37:46.829 --> 37:49.745
TO TAKE DOWN DELTA
SECURITY ENDEAVORS.

37:49.745 --> 37:52.095
MR. HARTLEY, I KNOW
YOUR REPUTATION.

37:52.095 --> 37:54.620
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT
YOUR HANDS ON THIS.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.665
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU DON'T.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.319
ALL THAT MATTERS,
YOU DIDN'T GET IT ILLEGALLY.

37:58.319 --> 37:59.799
IT'S ALL ADMISSIBLE.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.366
EVERYTHING ON THAT DRIVE
IS FAIR GAME

38:01.366 --> 38:03.281
FOR YOU TO LAUNCH
AN INVESTIGATION INTO DELTA.

38:04.934 --> 38:06.719
I SENSE AN ASK COMING.

38:06.719 --> 38:10.375
LOOK, ALL WE WANT IS JUSTICE.

38:10.375 --> 38:14.335
BUT IF YOU PURSUE IT, IF
YOU GET DELTA ON THE ROPES,

38:14.335 --> 38:16.816
WE WOULD LIKE SOME HELP
COMPELLING DELTA

38:16.816 --> 38:19.035
TO DROP THEIR CHARGES
AGAINST NICKY SHEN.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.086
BEFORE THE EMPEROR
TURNED ON HER,

38:26.086 --> 38:28.088
XIAO SUSPECTED THAT
SHE HAD LOST HIS FAVOR

38:28.088 --> 38:30.351
AND MADE SEVERAL TRIPS
TO THE OUTSKIRTS
OF THE KINGDOM.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.701
WE FOUND
A MATCH BETWEEN
CONTACTA MINING SITES

38:32.701 --> 38:34.573
AND THE SITE OF
ONE OF THESE TRIPS,

38:34.573 --> 38:37.010
A LITHIUM MINE IN
OUTER SHAANXI PROVINCE.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.664
AND AFTER YOU LEFT,
I DID SOME MORE RESEARCH.

38:38.664 --> 38:40.361
IT'S NOT
JUST A LITHIUM MINE.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.015
IT'S ALSO A REPOSITORY
FOR JYU SA.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.234
IT'S GOT TO BE
WHERE SHE'S HEADED.

38:44.234 --> 38:45.845
ONLY QUESTION IS--

38:45.845 --> 38:47.760
WHAT IS
SHE LOOKING FOR?

39:38.767 --> 39:40.856
HYAH!

40:02.051 --> 40:03.052
UH!

40:03.052 --> 40:04.184
HYAH!

41:11.512 --> 41:12.948
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.

41:12.948 --> 41:14.428
NICE SHOT, MOM!
