02:10.520 --> 02:11.619
Help!

02:13.723 --> 02:14.723
Hey!

03:07.046 --> 03:10.214
Every 23rd year, for 23 days,

03:10.817 --> 03:11.850
it gets to eat.

03:13.687 --> 03:16.088
And the things it leaves behind,

03:16.123 --> 03:18.043
like the thing it left in
Poho County that night,

03:19.526 --> 03:21.626
the nightmare on four wheels,

03:22.196 --> 03:24.229
was a horror all its own.

03:32.974 --> 03:33.974
Oh.

03:34.209 --> 03:36.008
Go get the sergeant.

03:41.049 --> 03:42.815
Sergeant!

03:43.818 --> 03:44.818
Sergeant!

03:47.356 --> 03:49.089
We got the truck open.

04:08.879 --> 04:09.879
God.

04:11.648 --> 04:14.616
God-damn slaughterhouse
on wheels.

04:17.521 --> 04:18.586
Police scanner.

04:20.257 --> 04:22.425
It's been listening to us.

04:23.928 --> 04:25.194
Whatever it is.

04:26.097 --> 04:27.763
Some of this stuff,

04:28.533 --> 04:30.566
I don't wanna know what it's made of.

04:30.668 --> 04:32.701
Where the hell is that tow truck?

04:32.804 --> 04:33.804
100.

04:34.305 --> 04:36.305
Coroner's still down in the jail.

04:36.340 --> 04:37.340
Should I get him up here?

04:42.080 --> 04:43.947
Those are for sawing.

04:44.149 --> 04:45.269
I don't wanna know for what.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.773
Get that god-damn
thing in the impound!

05:46.314 --> 05:47.314
Oh my god.

06:21.151 --> 06:22.851
I don't believe it.

06:25.023 --> 06:27.723
Jesus Christ, where
the hell have you been?

06:27.825 --> 06:30.459
How many did you lose tonight?

06:30.795 --> 06:33.996
You hold it together
and you answer me.

06:34.632 --> 06:38.434
Three officers, an
inmate down in the jail.

06:38.536 --> 06:40.069
And then the kid.

06:40.271 --> 06:42.372
The one he flew off with.

06:42.474 --> 06:43.674
Name of Jerry.

06:45.544 --> 06:48.445
His name was Jerry Jenner,
his sister's a train-wreck.

06:48.547 --> 06:50.158
She's inside waiting
for her folks that are

06:50.182 --> 06:52.215
driving in from Stillwater.

06:52.318 --> 06:53.850
Where is the last place you saw it?

07:35.297 --> 07:38.064
Don't touch that, and stay back!

07:50.412 --> 07:51.412
Show me.

07:59.756 --> 08:01.589
We threw everything
we had at it, Danny.

08:01.691 --> 08:05.660
All the fire and manpower
this building had to offer.

08:06.062 --> 08:07.339
And it just made a whole lot of noise

08:07.363 --> 08:10.599
and flew off with
exactly what it wanted.

08:10.701 --> 08:14.436
Sheriff, don't you want
us towing that truck?

08:15.239 --> 08:17.005
They just towed it out of here.

08:17.107 --> 08:18.240
Oh, no, no, no!

08:19.410 --> 08:21.677
Can't raise them, they're
not answering any frequency.

08:21.779 --> 08:23.857
- Where are they taking it?
- To impound, where else?

08:23.881 --> 08:25.801
Jesus Christ, we couldn't
leave it sitting there!

08:25.884 --> 08:26.884
You saw what it did.

08:27.719 --> 08:28.829
We gotta get an
armada round that thing.

08:28.853 --> 08:29.853
You make it happen, now!

08:30.455 --> 08:33.222
Anybody, everybody, get
on out there, move fast!

08:33.323 --> 08:35.258
Just a god-damn minute, Danny.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.494
You tell me how the hell
you know about any of this.

08:38.530 --> 08:42.210
Because what happened
here happened before!

08:42.433 --> 08:43.912
You think that thing
torched that church tonight

08:43.936 --> 08:45.169
because it wanted a camp fire?

08:45.271 --> 08:47.071
It was destroying information,

08:47.173 --> 08:49.406
trying to get rid of what
it doesn't want us to know.

08:49.508 --> 08:50.374
And that truck?

08:50.476 --> 08:52.676
That truck is that
thing's rolling history.

08:52.778 --> 08:55.079
Which is why we get it in
the impound and tear it apart.

08:55.181 --> 08:57.347
It ain't gonna make
it to the impound!

09:04.691 --> 09:07.625
Looks like rig up, old Chevy Cabo.

09:08.628 --> 09:10.862
Cabo engine, I'd say 1940s.

09:12.866 --> 09:15.700
That cow-catcher's
gotta be custom.

09:16.036 --> 09:17.681
You wanna tell me what
the hell a truck like that

09:17.705 --> 09:18.705
needs a cow-catcher for?

09:20.975 --> 09:23.909
If you knew what was inside that thing,

09:24.011 --> 09:26.812
that wouldn't be your only question.

09:32.253 --> 09:33.385
Code three, you read me?

09:33.488 --> 09:35.422
- Code three!
- Come again, sergeant?

09:35.524 --> 09:37.257
Just tell
that driver to put his foot

09:37.359 --> 09:40.260
on the gas, we're trying like hell...

09:55.545 --> 09:56.844
What the hell?

10:02.051 --> 10:04.385
- What is that?
- Jesus Christ!

10:05.588 --> 10:06.588
Holy shit!

10:49.402 --> 10:51.035
Fear has a scent.

10:52.972 --> 10:56.307
You can't have seen
that thing and hate it.

10:57.610 --> 11:01.345
Like it could sample fear
right out of the air.

11:02.950 --> 11:04.883
Dispatch, this is Lang
with the impound vehicle.

11:04.985 --> 11:05.985
Please respond.

11:07.054 --> 11:10.021
That's how it picks
what parts of us to eat.

11:10.123 --> 11:11.790
Captain, are you in range?

11:11.892 --> 11:13.458
- And it eats...
- This is Dana.

11:13.493 --> 11:15.253
We have a situation with
the impound vehicle.

11:15.662 --> 11:17.596
To rebuild itself.

11:24.439 --> 11:25.805
You hear that?

11:27.108 --> 11:28.541
It's coming back.

11:53.535 --> 11:54.535
What the...

12:36.581 --> 12:37.781
Stop!

12:37.883 --> 12:38.883
Stop!

12:39.618 --> 12:40.650
Stop!

12:40.919 --> 12:41.919
Frank!

12:42.988 --> 12:45.588
It never hunts in the same place,

12:45.691 --> 12:47.391
for more than a day.

12:47.994 --> 12:50.261
It's done with Poho County.

12:51.564 --> 12:54.065
All we can do now is head north,

12:54.467 --> 12:56.100
and follow the birds.

12:58.604 --> 13:01.472
It's not much, but it's all we know.

13:03.876 --> 13:07.446
Ravens and crows, they
travel when it does.

13:10.884 --> 13:14.519
Davis, I've looked that
ugly thing eye to eye.

13:17.591 --> 13:18.690
23 years ago.

13:21.830 --> 13:22.830
I know it.

13:25.033 --> 13:26.199
And it knows me.

14:44.716 --> 14:46.583
Why do you do this?

14:47.553 --> 14:50.788
It hurts too much seeing you like this.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.224
Mom, just listen, okay?

14:54.227 --> 14:58.029
Time's up, it's coming
back just like I said.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.431
Why?

15:00.033 --> 15:00.798
Stop asking, it doesn't matter.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.900
You.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.702
Tell me why it's coming here.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.572
Pieces of it left behind.

15:06.674 --> 15:09.241
They're full of secrets about it.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.444
That's what's buried up here?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.180
- A piece of it?
- There's no more time.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.749
It's coming here and you
can't be here when it does.

15:17.852 --> 15:20.119
- How do you know it's coming?
- I'm a part of it now!

15:20.221 --> 15:22.254
How many times do I
have to tell you that?

15:22.356 --> 15:23.467
It knows what's buried here,

15:23.491 --> 15:24.991
and it will come and take it back.

15:25.093 --> 15:26.860
Oh, killing you wasn't enough?

15:26.962 --> 15:29.062
Why didn't it take it 23 years ago?

15:29.164 --> 15:30.530
It ran out of time!

15:31.766 --> 15:34.601
It always runs out of time,
I can't keep telling you this.

15:35.937 --> 15:37.637
If you won't leave to save yourself,

15:37.739 --> 15:39.672
then do it to save Addison.

15:40.408 --> 15:41.408
Addison?

15:43.746 --> 15:45.946
Addison!

15:49.185 --> 15:51.752
You think that we have any money?

15:52.455 --> 15:53.935
Kenny, are you listening to yourself?

15:55.825 --> 15:56.825
Are you list.

15:57.493 --> 15:59.060
Just pack up and go?

15:59.997 --> 16:02.364
Pack up everything,
just leave for where?

16:02.466 --> 16:04.699
He knows it's here, Mom,
'cause I'm a part of it,

16:04.801 --> 16:05.867
and it's a part of me.

16:05.969 --> 16:07.736
Today, tomorrow or sometime soon,

16:07.838 --> 16:09.604
it is gonna walk up this
hill and it is gonna

16:09.706 --> 16:13.241
dig this thing up right
where I'm standing.

16:13.977 --> 16:18.080
And when it comes, it'll kill
anyone that's still here.

16:23.221 --> 16:24.221
Go away, Mom.

16:24.889 --> 16:25.889
Now.

16:56.990 --> 16:58.923
Good morning, handsome.

17:01.661 --> 17:03.494
Hey, you hungry, buddy?

17:09.337 --> 17:10.337
Damn.

17:12.540 --> 17:13.540
Come on.

17:14.508 --> 17:18.310
Gotta go talk to Grandma, and
I don't wanna do it alone.

17:44.307 --> 17:45.307
Grandma?

17:50.213 --> 17:51.279
Are you okay?

17:55.685 --> 17:58.085
I'm taking the truck into town.

18:01.025 --> 18:02.025
We need hay.

18:04.628 --> 18:06.561
Who is gonna pay for it?

18:07.498 --> 18:10.632
I was thinking maybe we
still had some credit at Hooks?

18:10.734 --> 18:12.200
He called again.

18:13.003 --> 18:15.637
We owe them more than we can pay.

18:17.007 --> 18:19.842
- Cal did say that he...
- Grandma, no.

18:20.045 --> 18:21.744
- Addie.
- I already told you.

18:21.846 --> 18:24.247
I'm not selling Rocket, Grandma.

18:24.549 --> 18:27.550
Selling him would be like
giving away my own child.

18:27.652 --> 18:29.218
What a good mother
might have to do

18:29.321 --> 18:31.821
so that child wouldn't go hungry.

18:33.325 --> 18:36.360
I want you to go
away for a few days.

18:38.331 --> 18:40.130
Maybe stay with Gracie.

18:41.634 --> 18:43.000
Why?

18:43.202 --> 18:45.135
Can you?

18:47.807 --> 18:51.875
Is there something that
you don't want me here for?

18:51.977 --> 18:52.977
Yes.

18:59.553 --> 19:01.519
I'm expecting company.

19:07.227 --> 19:08.993
You've got your team.

19:09.029 --> 19:12.832
You've got experienced
men who know this thing.

19:20.541 --> 19:21.541
Boss.

19:22.443 --> 19:23.476
Michael.

19:35.557 --> 19:37.557
This his old man's truck?

19:58.615 --> 20:00.915
It's an old Vulcan cannon.

20:01.017 --> 20:04.820
She's amped up to shoot 20mm
rounds, 6,000 rounds a minute.

20:05.823 --> 20:07.556
You test this thing?

20:08.959 --> 20:09.959
Mikey.

20:11.162 --> 20:12.694
Is this thing tested?

20:12.797 --> 20:15.531
This thing throws up a wall of fire.

20:15.633 --> 20:17.399
A wall of fire that
nothing from this world

20:17.501 --> 20:19.735
or the next can get through!

20:20.137 --> 20:23.673
Not without being torn
into a million pieces.

20:27.179 --> 20:30.914
She may not fly, but this
is our killing machine.

20:38.858 --> 20:39.858
Davis!

20:41.227 --> 20:43.394
He watched that thing fly down,

20:43.496 --> 20:45.763
and punch a hole in his old man.

20:45.865 --> 20:48.899
He stood there and
watched it pull the heart

20:49.001 --> 20:50.367
right out of his daddy's chest,

20:50.470 --> 20:53.604
and swallowed it
right before his eyes.

20:54.907 --> 20:57.142
Miller was only 10 years old.

20:59.713 --> 21:02.514
You're not losing your mind, Davis.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.350
You just got bloodied last night.

21:10.324 --> 21:14.427
Now do you wanna guess how
much blood I got on my hands?

21:15.296 --> 21:17.363
You've seen that thing now.

21:17.899 --> 21:20.800
So you got blood
on your hands, too.

21:21.135 --> 21:25.104
And no matter what you
do, it's gonna stay there.

21:25.206 --> 21:26.906
Whether you walk away,

21:28.209 --> 21:29.209
or not.

21:34.016 --> 21:36.183
Rendezvous on station one!

21:38.053 --> 21:39.053
North!

21:42.892 --> 21:45.158
Can I beg some hay off you?

21:45.261 --> 21:46.326
Sure, stranger.

21:46.695 --> 21:48.696
Our horses are up in Bolander.

21:48.798 --> 21:50.865
You're not up there with
Rocket winning trophies?

21:50.967 --> 21:53.701
I can't even afford the gas
to drive up there right now.

21:53.803 --> 21:55.470
What's the matter?

21:55.572 --> 21:56.572
Your grandma?

21:57.674 --> 21:59.318
Yeah, she was up on the
hill again this morning.

21:59.342 --> 22:00.608
Screaming at the wind?

22:00.710 --> 22:02.076
Calling it Kenny?

22:02.178 --> 22:04.546
Didn't he die like 20 years ago?

22:04.882 --> 22:05.882
Mom!

22:12.924 --> 22:14.590
You know you got a
rabbit in that trap?

22:14.692 --> 22:15.772
That's what it's there for.

22:16.661 --> 22:19.495
So it's suffering, are you
just gonna leave it in there?

22:19.597 --> 22:20.597
Mom!

22:23.201 --> 22:24.601
Mom, he's got a rabbit in the trap.

22:24.636 --> 22:26.336
Hey, Addie, long time no see.

22:26.438 --> 22:28.305
Mom said they were
eating up her garden.

22:28.407 --> 22:30.206
I didn't say you should trap them.

22:30.309 --> 22:32.549
- You didn't say I shouldn't.
- How's your grandma doin'?

22:32.578 --> 22:33.858
He doesn't care
about the garden.

22:34.780 --> 22:37.714
He traps them because he
likes killing them, he's sick.

22:38.116 --> 22:40.685
I mean, who likes to trap
and kill things for fun, huh?

22:40.787 --> 22:41.619
Psychos, maybe?

22:41.721 --> 22:43.241
He's too stupid to
even know he is one.

22:44.557 --> 22:46.001
Alright, stop, and you take
care of this before you leave,

22:46.025 --> 22:47.992
by which I mean let it go.

22:48.461 --> 22:49.727
It's not in any pain.

22:49.829 --> 22:51.629
Don't leave it in the
trap, it's cruel, honey.

22:56.369 --> 22:57.269
Stop!

22:57.371 --> 22:58.371
It's a rabbit, Mom.

22:58.772 --> 23:00.016
Do you know how small
their brains are?

23:00.040 --> 23:02.808
- 10 times bigger than yours?
- Well, then you let it out.

23:02.910 --> 23:04.042
And I hope it bites you.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.212
It's a wild animal, idiot,
it's kill or be killed.

23:07.314 --> 23:10.515
Just let it go
and stop trapping them, okay?

23:10.618 --> 23:12.884
You're all a bunch of women.

23:14.121 --> 23:15.455
Kirk.

23:15.557 --> 23:16.623
Get back here.

23:17.826 --> 23:22.128
Tell them about the law of
the jungle, will ya, Addie?

23:22.330 --> 23:25.698
Kirk, get out of the car and let it go.

23:31.439 --> 23:33.874
- What's out in the hay barn?
- Dad took what we had.

23:33.976 --> 23:37.311
That's okay, I'm on
my way to Hooks anyway.

23:37.413 --> 23:38.512
Oh, are you?

23:38.614 --> 23:40.748
Yes, and shut up.

23:40.850 --> 23:43.684
Buddy Hooks has a huge
crush on Addie, Mom.

23:43.786 --> 23:45.619
But neither one of
them are brave enough

23:45.721 --> 23:47.554
to do anything about it.

23:48.357 --> 23:50.825
You wouldn't wanna come
with me to Hooks, would you?

23:50.927 --> 23:52.494
And get in the way?

23:56.566 --> 23:58.099
Do you like him or not?

24:00.170 --> 24:02.804
He does have a really cute butt.

24:02.906 --> 24:05.273
And from that springs love!

24:22.126 --> 24:23.126
Idiot.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.816
What the hell is that?

25:03.938 --> 25:06.271
Somebody just ditched it out here?

25:06.373 --> 25:07.673
Hell, I would.

25:08.609 --> 25:10.409
What do you think's in it?

25:10.511 --> 25:14.346
Other than cow shit,
what do you think's in it?

25:20.021 --> 25:21.888
- No way.
- Oh, hell no.

25:22.891 --> 25:25.892
- No way what?
- Look at that license plate.

25:25.994 --> 25:28.261
Beating you?

25:28.363 --> 25:31.164
Be eating you, and no way.

25:31.266 --> 25:32.499
Right.

25:32.601 --> 25:34.769
No way, that story's bullshit.

25:35.404 --> 25:37.037
No, no, I
heard it really happened.

25:37.140 --> 25:38.439
Yeah, I did, too.

25:38.541 --> 25:41.609
- Real people disappeared.
- 20 years ago.

25:42.044 --> 25:43.744
23 and it's just a story.

25:43.846 --> 25:44.846
What story?

25:45.815 --> 25:47.381
The guy who drove
around and ate people.

25:47.483 --> 25:51.418
In a scary-ass old truck
with that license plate.

25:52.523 --> 25:53.989
Jeepers Creepers.

25:56.660 --> 25:57.692
What?

25:58.695 --> 26:01.930
Wasn't that the song the
guy sang or somethin'?

26:02.566 --> 26:04.299
Look, it's homemade.

26:04.401 --> 26:05.967
At least one idiot
every Halloween

26:06.069 --> 26:08.170
makes a license
plate that says that.

26:08.272 --> 26:10.139
You think it just drove in?

26:10.241 --> 26:12.074
The tracks look fresh.

26:16.114 --> 26:17.814
Do you think somebody
could be in there?

26:17.916 --> 26:18.916
Man.

26:19.184 --> 26:20.184
It's warm.

26:20.785 --> 26:22.145
Of course it's warm, you dip-shit.

26:22.587 --> 26:24.453
It's been sitting out in the sun.

26:24.556 --> 26:25.955
Who'd dump it out here?

26:26.057 --> 26:27.257
Who wouldn't?

26:33.199 --> 26:34.231
Hello!

26:39.071 --> 26:40.071
I can't see shit.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.842
What say we beat it
in case they come back?

26:44.411 --> 26:45.810
Anybody in there?

26:50.717 --> 26:52.951
Hey, hello in there!

26:54.287 --> 26:56.120
What the is wrong with you, man?

26:56.223 --> 26:57.223
What?

26:57.757 --> 26:58.835
- I was just knockin'!
- Well, don't.

26:58.859 --> 26:59.859
Idiot.

27:06.434 --> 27:08.300
Man, I say we get the hell outta here.

27:08.402 --> 27:09.402
Wait.

27:09.871 --> 27:11.270
Break the windows first?

27:11.372 --> 27:12.838
Hell yes, we do!

27:12.940 --> 27:16.008
We gotta kill Frankenstein's truck, right?

27:16.110 --> 27:17.977
Dibs on the windshield.

27:20.649 --> 27:23.149
Kiss my ass, you ugly old bitch!

27:29.591 --> 27:30.591
Did you see that?

27:31.560 --> 27:34.327
That thing tried to kill
me, nicked my ear.

27:34.796 --> 27:36.096
Maybe it tries to kill things

27:36.199 --> 27:37.465
more stupid than it.

27:53.283 --> 27:54.616
What the hell?

27:57.588 --> 27:59.187
Those can't be real.

28:00.190 --> 28:02.057
Those flies are real.

28:02.159 --> 28:03.792
That smell is real.

29:10.865 --> 29:13.532
You gonna be driving
up to see us?

29:14.135 --> 29:15.668
Go Wheaton Valley.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.004
Right?

29:17.538 --> 29:19.705
So, 10 bales of Alfalfa?

29:22.778 --> 29:23.778
Right.

29:30.552 --> 29:32.486
No grandma today, huh?

29:33.522 --> 29:34.955
How's she doin'?

29:41.164 --> 29:42.164
Um...

29:43.199 --> 29:45.566
You're not on the load list.

29:47.771 --> 29:48.771
Oh-oh.

29:51.007 --> 29:53.341
Do you wanna talk to my dad?

29:57.348 --> 29:58.680
Do you want me to?

30:01.185 --> 30:03.952
I should put her on my load list.

30:05.156 --> 30:08.190
You know why she lives
with her grandma, right?

30:08.292 --> 30:09.958
Addie couldn't get
along with her stepdad,

30:10.061 --> 30:12.261
so instead of kicking him
out, her mom ships her ass

30:12.363 --> 30:13.923
out here to live with
her crazy grandma.

30:17.302 --> 30:19.736
Can you really blame me
though, I mean, look at her.

30:19.838 --> 30:21.115
I'm just gonna go
to Carlan's and see if we have

30:21.139 --> 30:22.139
some credit on there.

30:24.242 --> 30:26.409
Hey, just wait a minute.

30:31.884 --> 30:33.084
What happened?

30:34.153 --> 30:35.631
Bernardy's, load it up
and get it out there now.

30:35.655 --> 30:36.987
He' waiting for it.

30:38.858 --> 30:40.191
What are you doing?

30:41.394 --> 30:42.771
She loves that horse more
than anything in the world,

30:42.795 --> 30:44.275
and right now it's
got nothing to eat.

30:44.730 --> 30:45.896
'Cause they're broke!

30:45.998 --> 30:48.011
You think we're ever gonna see
the money that they owe us?

30:48.035 --> 30:49.779
The state's not even
sending them checks anymore.

30:49.803 --> 30:51.837
And how do you know that?

30:51.939 --> 30:54.306
Biggs down at the post
office, how do you think?

30:54.408 --> 30:56.108
Make your point, Dad.

30:57.444 --> 30:59.177
You can do better.

31:00.013 --> 31:01.379
That's my point.

31:12.060 --> 31:13.860
Got some hay for you!

31:15.997 --> 31:17.830
Turn that thing around!

31:18.566 --> 31:21.467
Let's get your horse some breakfast!

31:22.370 --> 31:24.037
What's the problem?

31:24.140 --> 31:27.441
I thought you said you
had a hungry horse!

31:29.411 --> 31:30.811
Get it out!

31:36.886 --> 31:39.486
We gotta call someone!

31:40.423 --> 31:41.723
Just get it the hell out!

31:41.825 --> 31:42.865
What do you want us to do?

31:43.760 --> 31:45.071
Alright look, it's long
enough, I can pull it out.

31:45.095 --> 31:45.126
Do you want me to pull it out?

31:45.662 --> 31:46.662
Just call someone!

31:47.130 --> 31:48.250
There's no service out here!

31:49.199 --> 31:51.032
So shut up about the
god-damn phone, alright?

31:51.134 --> 31:53.401
- Kirk, look at me.
- Just do something!

31:53.503 --> 31:54.503
Like what?

31:54.971 --> 31:56.871
What the f... do you want us to do?

31:56.973 --> 31:59.675
You want us to try and pull it out?

32:01.479 --> 32:03.345
Alright, hold him up!

32:07.018 --> 32:08.018
Oh, shit.

32:13.224 --> 32:15.759
Okay, on three, are you ready?

32:16.228 --> 32:18.228
Hold him steady, come on!

32:19.298 --> 32:21.198
On three I'm gonna pull
like a son of a bitch.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.465
You guys ready?

32:24.403 --> 32:25.403
One!

32:27.005 --> 32:28.005
Two!

32:41.454 --> 32:42.454
Oh, shit.

32:43.122 --> 32:44.122
No!

32:45.458 --> 32:46.357
What the f...?

32:46.459 --> 32:48.292
No, help, help!

32:48.394 --> 32:49.394
Oh, shit.

32:49.762 --> 32:50.562
Help!

32:50.664 --> 32:51.363
No!

32:51.465 --> 32:52.465
Help, help!

32:54.368 --> 32:55.133
Red!

32:55.236 --> 32:56.236
Red!

32:57.204 --> 32:58.204
Red!

32:58.672 --> 32:59.672
Red!

33:05.746 --> 33:06.746
Help!

33:08.516 --> 33:10.250
Come on, come on!

33:10.952 --> 33:11.718
No!

33:11.820 --> 33:12.820
Help, no!

33:13.154 --> 33:14.154
No!

33:15.223 --> 33:16.789
No!

33:16.891 --> 33:17.891
Help!

33:20.095 --> 33:21.494
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not!

33:21.596 --> 33:22.829
I don't know what to do.

33:22.931 --> 33:24.091
Maybe we could cut the cable.

33:24.132 --> 33:24.965
With what?

33:25.067 --> 33:26.834
Try the phone again!

33:28.271 --> 33:29.271
Come on!

34:37.976 --> 34:40.945
So this is the famous Rocket, huh?

34:41.681 --> 34:42.813
He's a beauty.

34:43.483 --> 34:45.817
You understand what
I'm saying, don't you?

34:45.918 --> 34:47.418
Every word you say.

34:47.620 --> 34:48.620
Yeah?

34:48.987 --> 34:50.554
Well in that case,

34:50.989 --> 34:54.360
do you think Addie here
would ever be interested in

34:54.462 --> 34:55.793
say, a guy like me?

35:11.980 --> 35:15.081
In the city, my mother and I had a cat.

35:16.184 --> 35:17.550
Addie.

35:17.919 --> 35:19.486
I liked the cat.

35:20.956 --> 35:23.857
It crapped in her boyfriend's shoes,

35:24.059 --> 35:25.625
every chance it got.

35:26.595 --> 35:29.430
What happened to the boyfriend?

35:31.968 --> 35:33.534
She married him.

35:35.438 --> 35:37.338
Then got rid of the cat.

35:41.577 --> 35:43.944
Look, I'm not great at this.

35:44.782 --> 35:48.717
And when I get nervous,
I start talking too much.

35:52.823 --> 35:53.823
I, uh...

36:12.277 --> 36:14.377
Is that your grandmother?

36:25.191 --> 36:28.659
Thank you for the
hay, but please just go.

36:30.396 --> 36:31.396
Okay.

36:36.101 --> 36:38.069
You wouldn't wanna come?

36:41.007 --> 36:42.985
I mean, I gotta get the rest
of this stuff up to Bernardy's.

36:43.009 --> 36:44.642
Have you ever been up there?

36:44.744 --> 36:46.311
It's really something.

36:47.414 --> 36:48.780
I mean, only if you want to.

36:48.882 --> 36:49.948
I'd love to.

36:51.685 --> 36:52.685
Okay.

37:08.836 --> 37:10.469
What are you doing?

37:11.607 --> 37:13.106
I need to know what you found.

37:13.208 --> 37:13.840
Mom, what are you doing?

37:13.942 --> 37:15.809
And why it killed you for it!

37:15.911 --> 37:17.922
No you don't, you don't
wanna see what it'll show you.

37:17.946 --> 37:18.946
Go!

37:19.014 --> 37:20.014
Away!

37:21.083 --> 37:22.083
Go!

38:30.089 --> 38:31.089
Hey!

38:35.528 --> 38:36.293
Stop!

38:36.529 --> 38:37.561
Hey, stop!

38:43.303 --> 38:46.104
No!

38:50.711 --> 38:52.711
Come on, Gaylen, are you out there?

38:52.813 --> 38:55.947
I got a lot of units
headed out to station one.

38:56.049 --> 38:58.150
What is that, a roll bar?

38:58.720 --> 39:00.886
Did you reinforce this thing?

39:02.657 --> 39:06.292
First time I met Gaylen was 23 years ago.

39:08.262 --> 39:10.663
On the worst night of her life.

39:11.332 --> 39:14.601
Her son Kenny and his
date, Darla Cleeway,

39:14.903 --> 39:17.904
disappeared on their
way to the prom.

39:18.007 --> 39:21.775
All they found was a wrecked
pickup and no bodies.

39:21.877 --> 39:25.846
When Gaylen finally believed
what happened to Kenny,

39:25.948 --> 39:28.782
she asked if she
could join the team.

39:30.119 --> 39:32.387
That was the beginning for me.

39:33.356 --> 39:34.489
Like last night,

39:35.525 --> 39:37.692
was the beginning for you.

41:56.974 --> 41:58.440
Where is everybody?

42:13.392 --> 42:14.424
Buddy.

42:17.262 --> 42:18.262
Buddy.

42:28.041 --> 42:29.041
Hurry.

42:32.645 --> 42:34.745
Go tell the sheriff to
get up here and fast,

42:34.848 --> 42:37.081
and bring everything he's got.

42:37.483 --> 42:38.616
Get out of here.

42:38.952 --> 42:41.419
And keep your eyes on the sky.

42:41.521 --> 42:42.521
Do it.

43:02.744 --> 43:04.611
- Lock your door.
- What's going on?

43:04.713 --> 43:05.845
I don't know.

43:05.947 --> 43:08.548
There's men under that trailer.

43:11.686 --> 43:13.953
- Roll your window up.
- What's happening?

43:18.828 --> 43:19.828
Come on!

43:33.542 --> 43:35.075
Stop making noise.

43:35.946 --> 43:38.280
- Who's that with you?
- Addison Brandon.

43:38.382 --> 43:39.648
What's going on?

43:40.450 --> 43:42.984
- I've got guns in the barn.
- Guns?

43:43.086 --> 43:44.086
For what?

43:44.955 --> 43:47.489
Do you think you
could make a run for it?

43:47.591 --> 43:51.493
I'd do it myself if not for
my leg and this god-damn cane.

43:51.595 --> 43:53.629
What about those
guys under the truck?

43:53.731 --> 43:54.931
They won't move.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.401
They think they know this
thing, they got a name for it.

43:58.503 --> 44:00.970
Mr. Bernardy, what,
who are you hiding from?

44:01.072 --> 44:05.007
I don't know, I've seen
it and I still don't know.

44:05.376 --> 44:07.743
Something came
down and got Apple.

44:07.845 --> 44:08.845
Came down?

44:10.950 --> 44:12.416
Spooked the horses so bad,

44:12.518 --> 44:14.751
they jumped both the fences.

44:15.287 --> 44:17.220
It tried to come
down at get Matheo.

44:17.323 --> 44:18.323
What did?

44:20.292 --> 44:21.825
Matheo put up a fight.

44:21.927 --> 44:23.493
What are we talking about?

44:23.595 --> 44:24.995
It dropped him out there somewhere.

44:30.837 --> 44:31.903
No, no, no.

45:18.687 --> 45:19.687
Come on.

47:00.461 --> 47:01.927
Gaylen!

47:03.397 --> 47:04.431
Gaylen Brandon!

47:08.337 --> 47:09.337
Gaylen!

47:17.713 --> 47:19.746
Mrs. Brandon?

47:24.687 --> 47:25.687
Gaylen?

47:32.328 --> 47:34.295
I've been calling you.

47:50.714 --> 47:53.081
What the hell is the matter?

47:55.853 --> 47:56.853
It's here.

47:58.590 --> 48:01.291
Is that what you came here to say?

48:06.231 --> 48:08.064
If it's not, it will be.

48:19.278 --> 48:20.644
What happened?

48:22.582 --> 48:24.381
Just tell me one thing.

48:30.156 --> 48:33.325
Did you bring something that can kill it?

48:37.097 --> 48:39.164
He found it 23 years ago.

48:39.866 --> 48:40.899
Kenny.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.240
The night before he died.

48:52.780 --> 48:54.480
It fell from the sky.

49:01.122 --> 49:03.022
He didn't tell me he took it home,

49:03.124 --> 49:05.291
or that he hid it in the hay stool.

49:10.199 --> 49:12.866
The horses wouldn't stay
in the barn with it.

49:12.968 --> 49:14.601
Mom, get the horses.

49:16.905 --> 49:18.805
He wouldn't
say what was happening.

49:18.907 --> 49:19.907
Mom, just get the horses!

49:26.249 --> 49:29.050
He must have touched that thing,

49:29.152 --> 49:32.920
and that was why he was
so angry and frightened.

49:44.201 --> 49:47.336
He wanted to kill it, whatever it was.

49:51.275 --> 49:53.208
Maybe he thought he did.

50:09.227 --> 50:10.293
I trapped it.

50:17.003 --> 50:18.235
It's under there.

50:41.462 --> 50:42.462
Be careful.

50:43.464 --> 50:47.466
If you touch that thing,
if you put your hand on it,

50:49.136 --> 50:50.136
you see.

50:59.614 --> 51:01.748
You see how it came to be.

51:08.624 --> 51:09.624
And,

51:11.160 --> 51:12.160
what it is.

51:55.106 --> 51:56.106
Buddy.

52:06.718 --> 52:07.718
Bud?

52:17.196 --> 52:19.130
Seen a suspicious person.

52:38.686 --> 52:40.152
Stay down.

52:56.571 --> 52:58.671
Quick, can you see anything?

53:00.008 --> 53:01.541
Like what?

53:01.643 --> 53:03.243
There's knives
and stuff on both sides.

53:03.345 --> 53:06.513
Can you reach one that
will cut your rope?

53:07.282 --> 53:10.116
I tried, but it's hard for me to move.

53:24.567 --> 53:26.578
You think her dead kid came
over the hill this morning

53:26.602 --> 53:27.981
to tell her to vacate the premises?

53:28.005 --> 53:29.371
What if she's right?

53:29.473 --> 53:31.373
What if we can learn
that thing's secrets,

53:31.475 --> 53:34.976
just by touching that
piece of its own flesh?

53:38.815 --> 53:39.915
You're gonna go over there

53:40.017 --> 53:41.094
and hold hands with it, aren't ya?

53:41.118 --> 53:42.384
Just like she did.

53:43.654 --> 53:45.888
What do you think this
is if it isn't a war?

53:45.990 --> 53:48.024
War that absolutely won't stop,

53:48.126 --> 53:51.561
until that damn thing
doesn't exist anymore!

53:55.233 --> 53:57.567
If this thing gets away again,

54:00.271 --> 54:04.341
I'm either gonna be dead,
or too damn old next time.

54:11.917 --> 54:15.319
What if the secret to
what this thing is,

54:17.256 --> 54:19.756
is the secret of how to kill it?

54:50.524 --> 54:51.790
Hurry.

54:55.364 --> 54:58.264
Sometimes he comes back fast,
it's usually with another body

54:58.367 --> 55:01.234
and you don't wanna
be here for that.

55:07.643 --> 55:08.643
Kirk?

55:09.177 --> 55:11.811
- No way, Addie?
- Oh my god.

55:14.984 --> 55:17.485
My leg, I can't walk on it.

55:18.054 --> 55:22.089
But I could drag myself,
just get me out of this.

55:24.327 --> 55:25.359
I checked.

55:26.195 --> 55:27.094
They're dead.

55:27.196 --> 55:30.032
He thinks I'm dead,
too, and probably you.

55:30.134 --> 55:31.433
Why aren't we?

55:32.636 --> 55:34.314
I was passed out when he
wrapped me and threw me in here.

55:34.338 --> 55:36.471
But from what I could tell,
I think he's in too big

55:36.573 --> 55:38.874
of a hurry to care if we are or not.

55:38.976 --> 55:40.286
Yeah, well let's get out of here.

55:40.310 --> 55:41.310
No!

55:42.413 --> 55:45.213
Only he opens those, you
try, it'll split you in two.

55:45.315 --> 55:48.518
This whole truck's a death-trap.

55:50.388 --> 55:51.554
Maybe the front.

55:52.757 --> 55:54.457
Try the driver's door.

55:55.593 --> 55:56.959
What do you see?

55:57.295 --> 56:00.129
It just looks like a door handle.

56:01.132 --> 56:03.866
There's a chain, should I try that?

56:03.968 --> 56:04.968
Try what?

56:05.905 --> 56:07.385
I don't know, maybe
it does something.

56:14.680 --> 56:16.447
Like maybe the horn.

56:17.149 --> 56:19.016
Try that door handle.

56:24.157 --> 56:27.992
Say a little prayer that
one of these doors opens.

57:41.238 --> 57:42.504
Get behind him.

57:47.945 --> 57:49.278
Get behind him.

58:03.161 --> 58:04.928
Put your hands on him.

58:51.946 --> 58:52.946
Danny.

58:57.385 --> 58:59.519
I know where you're going.

59:04.493 --> 59:05.893
You will come back.

59:10.699 --> 59:11.699
Danny!

59:13.168 --> 59:14.534
Danny!

59:14.937 --> 59:16.203
Look at me, boss!

59:18.174 --> 59:19.174
Sheriff!

59:20.877 --> 59:21.976
- Boss!
- Danny?

01:00:27.414 --> 01:00:28.414
Danny?

01:00:30.985 --> 01:00:32.017
Danny!

01:00:34.722 --> 01:00:35.754
Danny.

01:00:36.924 --> 01:00:40.959
Look at me.

01:00:56.011 --> 01:00:57.011
I'm next.

01:01:00.015 --> 01:01:01.015
Boss?

01:01:05.121 --> 01:01:07.321
Are you out of
your god-damn mind?

01:01:07.423 --> 01:01:10.024
With all due respect,
sergeant, you stand down.

01:01:10.126 --> 01:01:12.493
You don't tell me to stand down.

01:01:12.595 --> 01:01:13.627
You don't know!

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400
Not like us.

01:01:27.844 --> 01:01:29.978
You got no takeaway in this.

01:01:36.521 --> 01:01:37.521
Alright.

01:01:39.157 --> 01:01:40.157
Alright.

01:01:44.295 --> 01:01:46.429
No!

01:01:46.531 --> 01:01:47.863
Stop, stop, stop!

01:01:48.733 --> 01:01:49.733
Get him off!

01:01:53.972 --> 01:01:55.012
Anybody out there read me?

01:01:55.074 --> 01:01:56.606
Repeat, Team Deputy...

01:01:56.708 --> 01:01:57.708
Get off me!

01:02:00.646 --> 01:02:02.579
Any team members
out there at all, copy me.

01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:03.881
Repeat, Deputy Mike McGrail...

01:02:05.017 --> 01:02:06.017
Hello!

01:02:06.819 --> 01:02:10.287
I got a flipped vehicle
in a field up Turvy Road.

01:02:10.389 --> 01:02:12.123
And I mean upside-down
and still smokin'.

01:02:12.225 --> 01:02:13.825
It's headed to the nine.

01:02:13.927 --> 01:02:15.204
Who is this, is that the sheriff?

01:02:15.228 --> 01:02:16.308
This is team leader Miller.

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:18.896
We copy and are putting
rubber to the road.

01:02:18.998 --> 01:02:20.631
Maybe 15 minutes away.

01:02:20.733 --> 01:02:22.467
No lights, no sirens.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:30.909
This thing hits the nine, we're
gonna take it by surprise.

01:02:31.011 --> 01:02:34.079
You and Brady, you
come in from the east.

01:02:34.181 --> 01:02:35.981
Miller, you and Jenkins,

01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:40.219
see if you can find a road
that gets you in front of it.

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:45.224
The point is to stay alive.

01:02:48.697 --> 01:02:51.831
It's what your old
man would have wanted.

01:03:00.742 --> 01:03:03.009
You find Addie and the two of
you get the hell outta here

01:03:03.111 --> 01:03:06.247
and don't come back until
I tell you different.

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:07.815
So you're just okay now?

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.461
I just saw you rollin'
around on the ground

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:11.285
like you were having
your brain scrambled.

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:12.987
I can drive, Danny.

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:14.823
Danny!

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:19.326
Danny, god-damn it, move
over and let me in there!

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:21.897
I got no idea, sheriff
up in Kissle says

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:23.399
they can't even get
a man down here.

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:27.068
Bud is really scarin' me.

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:28.581
He's in some kind of
shock or something,

01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:30.872
and he's not snapping out of it.

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:34.409
- I'm getting ready to run him...
- I let her go.

01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:39.415
I let her go.

01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:45.821
I couldn't hold on, Dad.

01:03:47.425 --> 01:03:48.702
I let her go and now she's out there

01:03:48.726 --> 01:03:50.393
with that thing somewhere.

01:03:50.495 --> 01:03:51.495
Sit.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.531
- I left her out there.
- Sit down.

01:03:56.402 --> 01:03:58.735
- I left her, Dad!
- Sit down and stop.

01:03:58.837 --> 01:03:59.837
Stop talking.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.820
All I know is that the truck
looks like it's been rolled.

01:04:09.915 --> 01:04:10.915
It's missing a god...

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:14.285
Jesus Christ.

01:04:15.355 --> 01:04:16.355
Bud!

01:04:26.032 --> 01:04:27.932
Holy Mary Mother of God.

01:04:28.368 --> 01:04:29.968
You son of a bitch.

01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:37.409
Straight with me, can we kill this thing?

01:04:38.679 --> 01:04:41.180
Are you still a sharpshooter?

01:04:42.617 --> 01:04:44.483
Bet your sweet ass I am.

01:04:47.255 --> 01:04:50.523
Get me up closer to
that son of a bitch!

01:04:51.293 --> 01:04:52.826
Take his tire out.

01:05:02.237 --> 01:05:03.436
Hit him again!

01:05:07.677 --> 01:05:10.411
What the hell are they made of?

01:05:11.848 --> 01:05:12.848
Again!

01:05:19.055 --> 01:05:20.187
Son of a bitch!

01:05:34.405 --> 01:05:35.604
What the hell?

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:57.494
Mikey?

01:06:05.204 --> 01:06:07.705
Oh, come here, you big ugly bastard!

01:06:07.807 --> 01:06:09.707
- Oh, my sweet...
- Christ.

01:06:09.809 --> 01:06:12.776
Everything ricochets off that truck.

01:06:12.878 --> 01:06:15.180
Mikey, come in, Mikey, listen to me.

01:06:15.282 --> 01:06:17.048
That truck...

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:19.417
Straight at it, Jenky, go!

01:06:25.292 --> 01:06:26.791
Mikey, come in!

01:06:27.561 --> 01:06:28.561
Michael!

01:06:29.129 --> 01:06:31.162
Don't shoot at the god-damn truck!

01:06:31.264 --> 01:06:33.265
Mikey!

01:06:33.368 --> 01:06:34.533
Do you read me?

01:06:41.275 --> 01:06:42.308
Mikey, come in.

01:06:46.347 --> 01:06:47.813
Michael, pick up!

01:06:47.915 --> 01:06:49.882
Mikey, do you read me?

01:06:49.985 --> 01:06:52.319
Don't shoot at that god-damn truck!

01:06:52.421 --> 01:06:55.956
For my old man and 1,000 others, you ugly.

01:07:21.084 --> 01:07:22.084
Hold on!

01:07:59.124 --> 01:08:00.124
Danny?

01:08:23.484 --> 01:08:24.515
Danny!

01:08:28.255 --> 01:08:29.255
Danny!

01:08:44.506 --> 01:08:45.506
Take this!

01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:48.609
Son of a...

01:08:56.819 --> 01:08:57.819
Cover me.

01:09:01.023 --> 01:09:02.023
Davis!

01:09:04.926 --> 01:09:05.926
Get down!

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.268
Don't give him what he wants.

01:09:15.538 --> 01:09:16.871
Swallow your fear.

01:09:19.142 --> 01:09:20.774
Don't give it to him.

01:09:22.112 --> 01:09:24.145
You cover me as best you can.

01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:27.049
Then you haul your ass outta here.

01:09:27.151 --> 01:09:29.752
It can't get both of us if we split up.

01:09:29.854 --> 01:09:30.854
Split up?

01:09:31.856 --> 01:09:34.122
We both gotta take him, Danny.

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:36.358
We need the firepower!

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:40.694
Hey!

01:10:41.329 --> 01:10:42.362
Hey, you!

01:11:05.421 --> 01:11:08.489
Davis, get the hell
out of here, move!

01:14:08.014 --> 01:14:11.349
Whatever you think
you can do, you can't.

01:14:13.353 --> 01:14:15.653
You're not gonna stop me.

01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:18.390
So go away.

01:14:19.259 --> 01:14:22.560
It took her, Mom, it's got Addison now.

01:14:26.834 --> 01:14:27.834
What?

01:15:01.437 --> 01:15:02.770
Where's Addie?

01:18:50.513 --> 01:18:52.113
You have reached
the tri-county Sheriff's

01:18:52.148 --> 01:18:56.049
department, servicing Baniff,
Trotula and Poho Counties.

01:18:56.152 --> 01:18:58.352
This line is for emergency calls only.

01:18:58.454 --> 01:19:01.021
If this is an emergency,
please hold the line.

01:21:04.086 --> 01:21:05.453
Addie?

01:21:35.019 --> 01:21:39.088
Every 23rd spring
for 23 days, it gets to eat.

01:21:41.827 --> 01:21:43.360
That's what we know.

01:21:45.531 --> 01:21:49.166
And the terrible things
it leaves in its wake,

01:21:50.803 --> 01:21:52.869
missing fathers and mothers,

01:21:54.707 --> 01:21:56.273
brothers, sisters,

01:21:59.045 --> 01:22:00.511
daughters and sons.

01:22:03.183 --> 01:22:04.482
We know that, too.

01:22:09.656 --> 01:22:12.156
The creature reshapes our minds,

01:22:13.493 --> 01:22:16.395
and changes the course of our lives.

01:22:51.601 --> 01:22:53.467
What are you doing here?

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:57.505
They're picking me up here,
I didn't miss 'em, did I?

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:01.542
- They're picking you up here?
- So I could say goodbye.

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:04.178
They don't care,
it's on the way.

01:23:05.381 --> 01:23:07.616
Really, are you doing okay?

01:23:08.852 --> 01:23:12.154
I'm out of the house, out in the sunshine.

01:23:12.256 --> 01:23:14.423
And back with your
old boyfriend, huh?

01:23:19.096 --> 01:23:21.163
They say it's gone, you know.

01:23:21.265 --> 01:23:23.098
You really believe it?

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.034
Gone for another 23 years?

01:23:25.136 --> 01:23:29.071
You think we'll still be
around here to find out?

01:23:39.684 --> 01:23:41.785
I'm gonna worry about you.

01:23:41.887 --> 01:23:43.432
I can't believe they're letting you go.

01:23:43.456 --> 01:23:44.466
The last time we made it to state.

01:23:44.490 --> 01:23:46.523
I don't think Armageddon
will keep us from goin'.

01:23:46.559 --> 01:23:47.559
Is that your dad talking?

01:23:48.093 --> 01:23:50.327
I got a family who live in Bolander.

01:23:50.429 --> 01:23:52.162
I might stay an extra day.

01:23:52.264 --> 01:23:53.096
I'm gonna miss you.

01:23:53.199 --> 01:23:56.066
Well, I'll miss you more, I'll bet.

01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:59.337
Keep an eye on my truck for me.

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.308
At the end of those 23 days,

01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:38.879
in an open field by a
broken down school bus,

01:24:39.214 --> 01:24:41.314
it once again ran out of time,

01:24:41.416 --> 01:24:44.284
at the rusty tip of a homemade harpoon.

01:24:44.386 --> 01:24:47.220
But most of you know this already.

01:24:47.322 --> 01:24:50.123
I record these words as a testament.

01:24:51.761 --> 01:24:54.629
This 23rd spring is a call to arms.

01:24:55.298 --> 01:24:58.332
We will not fail and we will not fear.

01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:03.170
My name is Trisha Jenner,

01:25:04.807 --> 01:25:07.174
and this time when it comes,

01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:11.313
I will destroy the thing
that killed by brother.

01:25:14.718 --> 01:25:15.718
So...

01:25:17.087 --> 01:25:19.988
Come and get me,
you son of a bitch.

01:25:20.012 --> 01:25:22.012
