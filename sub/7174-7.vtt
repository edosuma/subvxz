12:57.316 --> 12:59.008
I'm okay.

12:59.042 --> 13:01.175
Can you give us a moment?

13:12.481 --> 13:14.607
That's James?

13:14.641 --> 13:16.871
That's all of us.

13:17.071 --> 13:18.872
Brave woman,

13:19.082 --> 13:21.452
being part of a family co-op.

13:21.565 --> 13:25.502
It's hard enough for one
husband to get along with me.

13:25.536 --> 13:27.871
We try not to keep secrets.

13:27.905 --> 13:30.745
Good for any relationship.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.597

13:34.784 --> 13:37.600
We don't see these much anymore.

13:37.771 --> 13:39.268
Are they antique?

13:46.749 --> 13:49.585
Jimmy liked to think
of himself as a knight.

13:49.666 --> 13:52.134
He thought it was a funny story.

13:52.169 --> 13:55.410
I never broke it to him
that it was a tragedy.

13:55.906 --> 13:58.838
Can we stop with the bullshit now?

13:58.939 --> 14:03.775
Oh, I had a little left about
how charming your home is.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.239

14:05.392 --> 14:06.993
Should we sit down?

14:07.160 --> 14:09.550
I don't think you're
gonna be staying that long.

14:09.633 --> 14:12.319
You're not just here to
tell me my son is dead.

14:12.354 --> 14:14.514
You could've done that with a letter.

14:14.582 --> 14:18.218
You're here because you think
he had something to do with it.

14:18.268 --> 14:21.688
The water hauler the Martians destroyed,

14:21.793 --> 14:24.435
and the battleship they lost.

14:24.554 --> 14:27.007
You think he was involved?

14:27.124 --> 14:28.827

14:28.932 --> 14:32.542
I like living near the
land. Doesn't make me stupid.

14:32.613 --> 14:33.905
Was he involved?

14:33.940 --> 14:35.279
Of course not!

14:35.337 --> 14:37.699
- He would never...
- Oh, no wait. I know this one.

14:37.761 --> 14:40.068
"My boy was a little angel,

14:40.122 --> 14:42.827
"he never even hurt an insect...

14:42.862 --> 14:46.915
"Oh, if you'd just seen what
a wonderful child he was."

14:47.000 --> 14:50.125
And I thought we were
done with the bullshit.

14:50.386 --> 14:52.857
How about this one?

14:52.905 --> 14:55.123
James Holden was conceived

14:55.158 --> 14:58.428
by a cult of political
extremists as a trick

14:58.463 --> 15:02.756
for eight people to claim
generational land rights.

15:02.850 --> 15:04.217
Kicked out of the Navy,

15:04.251 --> 15:07.885
he fell in with a radical
fringe group in the Belt

15:07.942 --> 15:10.832
because it reminded him of home.

15:10.867 --> 15:14.120
I can make shit up, too.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.145
Why are you here?

15:16.179 --> 15:18.341
I need to understand your son.

15:18.436 --> 15:20.617
And what will that accomplish now?

15:20.652 --> 15:22.314
I have two governments,

15:22.349 --> 15:25.704
and whatever the hell the OPA calls itself,

15:25.777 --> 15:30.011
on a course toward a war
that your son started.

15:30.063 --> 15:34.227
I want to stop it before
anyone else loses a kid.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.524
I can't help you.

15:35.559 --> 15:36.799
Can't?

15:36.889 --> 15:37.767
Or you choose not to?

15:37.802 --> 15:40.876
What good will any of this do?

15:41.038 --> 15:45.143
What could I possibly say to you
that would make any difference now?

15:45.211 --> 15:47.631
Make him make sense to me.

15:47.723 --> 15:49.942
He's raised by people like you,

15:50.047 --> 15:52.584
and he joins the Earth Navy?

15:52.645 --> 15:55.395
Was he trying to piss you off?

15:55.441 --> 15:58.258
Or did he want to see how the enemy worked?

15:58.374 --> 16:01.999
Why did he leave your little paradise here?

16:02.744 --> 16:05.057
You haven't told me he's dead.

16:05.092 --> 16:07.571
You're dancing around it.

That's a lot of winnings.

28:03.972 --> 28:05.773
That's how you say goodbye?

28:05.808 --> 28:07.891
With a creepy message?

28:10.711 --> 28:13.206
I was just coming to check your apartment,

28:13.241 --> 28:16.459
thought I might find your
brains splattered on the wall.

28:16.523 --> 28:19.075
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT) That didn't, uh,

28:19.164 --> 28:21.175
come out very good.

Yeah, no shit.

What are you doing?

28:25.332 --> 28:27.667
Well, um...

28:27.756 --> 28:29.057
I'm gonna take a trip.

28:29.150 --> 28:31.973
- To where?
- Eros.

28:32.031 --> 28:34.766
Yeah, I'm gonna, uh,

28:34.844 --> 28:35.978
see the sights.

28:36.013 --> 28:39.630
What sights? Miller,
Eros is a garbage dump.

28:39.665 --> 28:43.718
If this thing is as big as you think it is,

28:43.905 --> 28:46.817
you're gonna need someone
to watch your back.

28:46.910 --> 28:48.493
A partner.

28:50.340 --> 28:52.258
Yeah.

28:52.293 --> 28:54.377
I think I'd better do this one alone.

29:23.832 --> 29:25.832
Good luck, Miller.

29:40.265 --> 29:42.322
We've been trying to save this land

29:42.357 --> 29:45.076
ever since before Jimmy was born.

29:45.155 --> 29:47.590
He was gonna take over for us.

29:47.625 --> 29:49.927
The way we raised him,

29:50.008 --> 29:54.870
he grew up thinking he was alive
because the land needed him.

29:56.571 --> 29:59.623
That's a terrible thing to tell a child.

29:59.829 --> 30:01.631
But he never complained,

30:01.666 --> 30:04.217
because it was what we all wanted.

30:04.281 --> 30:05.711
By the time he was a teenager,

30:05.785 --> 30:09.455
he was reading all the briefs Tom wrote.

30:09.506 --> 30:11.988
He went to the hearings,

30:12.039 --> 30:14.985
stood at the gates to greet whatever goons

30:15.043 --> 30:18.295
the government sent to harass us.

30:18.455 --> 30:21.421
- No offense.
- None taken.

30:21.904 --> 30:25.090
We set him up to be a leader,

30:25.344 --> 30:28.393
and then gave him a
fight he could never win.

30:29.737 --> 30:32.923

30:32.958 --> 30:35.256
I took him out to mend a fence,

30:35.299 --> 30:37.713
and I told him to get as far away

30:37.748 --> 30:40.083
from this place as he could.

30:40.254 --> 30:42.890
And that if he didn't go, then I would,

30:42.925 --> 30:47.362
because I couldn't stand to watch
what we were doing to him anymore.

30:47.419 --> 30:49.971

- HOLDEN: I did.

31:33.657 --> 31:35.214
KENZO: That's not gonna help, either.

31:35.249 --> 31:37.655
You kill the power to the magnetic
seal, the backup in that locker

31:37.736 --> 31:39.781
is gonna kick in and keep it shut.

31:39.816 --> 31:42.198
That's why I'm gonna kill
the power source first

31:42.263 --> 31:43.201
so the backup doesn't trigger.

31:43.236 --> 31:44.748
It's a good idea, but
there's not enough time.

31:50.111 --> 31:51.641
I'm gonna go prep for plan B.

31:51.676 --> 31:52.742
What's plan B?

31:52.777 --> 31:55.701
To get down to that airlock
and make sure nobody boards us.

32:16.031 --> 32:17.832
Any Martians come through that airlock,

32:17.867 --> 32:20.517
we subdue and take them
prisoner. Nobody's dying.

32:20.552 --> 32:22.964
So, they'll have a chance
to ping the mothership?

32:26.460 --> 32:29.151

32:29.233 --> 32:31.650
I'm gonna take 'em down clean and fast,

32:31.723 --> 32:33.610
then we're gonna burn
like hell somewhere safe.

32:33.645 --> 32:35.331
Figure out what our
next move is from there.

32:35.397 --> 32:39.534
Do you know how many Martians died
getting us off the <i>Donnager?</i>

32:39.827 --> 32:43.045
Ship that size? Few hundred.

32:43.080 --> 32:46.290
And now you're gearing up to kill
a few more like it was nothing.

32:46.482 --> 32:48.648
Because they are the enemy right now.

32:48.714 --> 32:50.393
And we're the fugitives.

32:50.428 --> 32:51.580
And as far as they're concerned,

32:51.653 --> 32:54.238
we're the ones who blew
up the <i>Donnager.</i>

32:54.435 --> 32:58.270
And I am not spending the rest
of my days in a Martian gulag.

33:04.032 --> 33:05.983

If the price of justice is more
innocent blood, then I don't want it.

39:59.422 --> 40:01.367
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

40:01.433 --> 40:03.935
Okay, but let me ask you something else.

40:03.986 --> 40:06.839
Are you anything like that
animal you got topside?

40:06.964 --> 40:08.206
Amos, you call him?

40:08.241 --> 40:10.151
- No.
- Good.

40:12.278 --> 40:15.113
I don't care what you're involved in.

40:15.148 --> 40:18.918
I am just a guy trying to do my
job, like you and your people.

40:18.984 --> 40:21.899
I have family out there, too.

40:21.934 --> 40:24.186
If you can look at yourself in the mirror,

40:24.292 --> 40:28.179
and still decide that you're
gonna toss me into space,

40:28.291 --> 40:30.042
because I'm

40:30.437 --> 40:32.654
inconvenient to you

40:34.130 --> 40:38.067
then at least you can do me the respect

40:38.179 --> 40:40.430
of telling me that it's gonna happen.

40:40.637 --> 40:43.388
And mercy is not in the cards for me.

40:43.479 --> 40:45.960
So I can make my peace.

40:47.941 --> 40:52.535
Because I am not an animal either.

40:54.212 --> 40:55.928
Mmm.
