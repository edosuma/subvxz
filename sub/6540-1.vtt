WEBVTT

01:24.267 --> 01:25.329
Go!

01:37.541 --> 01:40.978
- Morning.
- Yes, it is.

01:41.646 --> 01:43.380
Shit!

01:45.192 --> 01:46.447
Come on!

01:49.284 --> 01:52.821
- You got $1.25 on there?
- Is this machine working?

01:52.921 --> 01:55.097
Is my machine working?

01:55.197 --> 01:57.625
- There you go. Five quarters.
- Yes.

01:57.725 --> 02:00.399
We've got a lot of people in a hurry
here. So whatever you can do.

02:00.499 --> 02:02.608
Sir, it's what I've got.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.694
I got you.

02:05.794 --> 02:08.633
There you go.
Hey, the machine's working.

02:08.733 --> 02:11.066
- $1.25.
- All right, have a seat.

02:21.327 --> 02:23.436
Open the fuckin' door!

02:47.965 --> 02:49.768
Sir, I don't even know
what you're talking...

02:49.868 --> 02:53.637
- So you don't know what I'm talking about?
- No, sir, no. I do not.

02:54.137 --> 02:57.306
That's interesting, because we have you
and your little slut bunny

02:57.406 --> 03:02.554
on camera getting all nice and cozy
with the same guy in the parking lot.

03:03.707 --> 03:06.080
So I'm going to ask you again...

03:06.830 --> 03:09.447
Who is this fuckin' guy
and where is our fuckin' money?

03:12.317 --> 03:13.886
I... I don't know.

03:13.986 --> 03:16.588
There's only so many ways
that I can ask you nicely.

03:16.688 --> 03:19.056
This... this is nicely?

03:19.489 --> 03:20.964
Fuck.

03:21.064 --> 03:25.156
Oh, fuckin' Christ, man!
What the fuck? What the fuck?

03:25.256 --> 03:28.031
Fuck! Fuckin'...

03:28.331 --> 03:30.050
No.

03:30.431 --> 03:32.968
- God!
- Damn it! Let go of me!

03:33.068 --> 03:37.671
- Babe... baby, I'm so fuckin' sorry.
- Oh, my God, baby! What did they do to you?

03:37.771 --> 03:40.307
- We don't know who he is, asshole!
- I'm sorry.

03:40.407 --> 03:43.591
Asshole? Okay.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.184
Asshole, it is.

03:45.284 --> 03:47.992
She didn't mean that!
She didn't mean it!

03:48.092 --> 03:49.948
Derrick!

03:50.048 --> 03:53.215
Derrick. Derrick.

03:57.053 --> 03:59.554
Bat's not always the answer.

04:05.926 --> 04:07.729
Funny thing about these e-cigarettes.

04:07.829 --> 04:13.457
I miss the satisfaction of burning something
down to fuckin' ashes in your hand.

04:16.201 --> 04:18.378
My apologies.

04:18.871 --> 04:22.163
Derrick can be
a little overzealous at times.

04:23.937 --> 04:27.379
- Mr. Pope, this is just...
- I'm not finished.

04:27.779 --> 04:31.649
I've been Derrick's mentor for a while
now. I taught him everything he knows...

04:31.749 --> 04:34.868
how to run a casino floor,
how to run a business,

04:34.968 --> 04:37.282
how to really run a business,

04:37.382 --> 04:40.523
but most importantly,
how to spot a thief.

04:40.623 --> 04:43.492
Because in our business,
the number 1 rule is

04:43.592 --> 04:46.728
"Never let anyone steal from you,"

04:46.828 --> 04:51.679
because if even one person steals
from you, even as little as...

04:51.779 --> 04:54.398
- 10 Gs.
- ...$10,000,

04:54.498 --> 04:58.271
it's a sign of weakness. It's a drop
of blood in shark-infested waters,

04:58.371 --> 04:59.805
a hole in your defense.

04:59.905 --> 05:04.155
And when people think you're weak,
they come in droves to take what's yours.

05:04.255 --> 05:06.607
Like flies to the proverbial shit.

05:06.977 --> 05:10.516
Normally I'd give Derrick here all night
to make your regret stealing from me.

05:10.616 --> 05:11.703
No, but we didn't...

05:11.803 --> 05:15.475
But now, you've made me late for my own
surprise party. So here's what we're gonna do,

05:15.575 --> 05:18.220
I'm going to give you both 10 seconds
to tell me where the money is

05:18.320 --> 05:20.688
and whose idea it was
to take it in the first place,

05:20.788 --> 05:23.657
or Derrick here kills you both...

05:23.757 --> 05:26.193
- Oh, God!
- ...and I lose out on 10 grand,

05:26.293 --> 05:28.795
which, frankly, means shit to me.
'Cause you know what?

05:28.895 --> 05:31.064
This is about principle, not money.

05:31.556 --> 05:35.000
- No, please.
- It's that simple.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.536
- Ten, nine...
- We don't know who took your fuckin' money!

05:37.636 --> 05:40.231
- ...eight, seven...
- Please!

05:40.331 --> 05:43.842
- ...six, five...
- No, Mr. Pope! Mr. Pope!

05:43.942 --> 05:46.344
- ...four, three...
- We don't know who he is! Please!

05:46.444 --> 05:48.542
- ...three...
- Mr. Pope, we don't have your money!

05:48.642 --> 05:52.316
- ...two, one.
- Fuckin'! Glenn Haley! Glenn fuckin' Haley!

05:52.416 --> 05:55.585
He's staying at Candlewood, 451!
And it's all her fuckin' idea!

05:55.685 --> 05:58.462
- What? What? You fuckin' bastard!
- It's all her fuckin' idea!

05:58.562 --> 06:00.288
I can't...

06:00.388 --> 06:01.956
- Oh, fuck!
- You see, Derrick?

06:02.056 --> 06:04.058
- No, fuck!
- Bat's not always the answer.

06:04.158 --> 06:07.594
When it comes down to it, when it's you
or them, as a species, it's in our DNA,

06:07.694 --> 06:10.156
our very nature,
to choose self-preservation.

06:10.256 --> 06:13.432
I don't care if you're Mother Teresa,
Mahatma Gandhi or fuckin' Ned Flanders.

06:13.532 --> 06:16.268
When the chips are down, we choose life
over loved ones, every time.

06:16.368 --> 06:17.536
- Got it.
- You know.

06:17.636 --> 06:19.771
Can I... Can I go now, Mr. Pope?

06:20.171 --> 06:23.638
Sure, you can go now.
Derrick, show him the door.

06:34.715 --> 06:36.045
30 years.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.923
30 years, not one vacation,
not one sick day. Now he's leaving us.

06:40.023 --> 06:41.895
- We're all going to miss you, Mr. Pope.
- I'll miss you.

06:41.995 --> 06:43.323
He's leaving us for good.

06:43.423 --> 06:46.693
If he owes you some money, you better get it
quick, 'cause he's out of here next week.

06:48.379 --> 06:50.324
A toast to the man himself.

06:50.424 --> 06:54.499
Our hope, our savior, our Pope.

06:54.599 --> 06:56.632
Our Pope!

07:09.729 --> 07:11.747
Ain't much of a trick
if you can't finish it, pal.

07:13.479 --> 07:15.484
Is that your card?

07:15.684 --> 07:16.868
How'd you do that?

07:16.968 --> 07:19.659
I can't tell you that.
That's why it's magic.

07:19.759 --> 07:23.206
Slight of hand, my friend. While you're busy
watching the deck in the left hand,

07:23.556 --> 07:25.658
the magic was happening in the right.

07:25.758 --> 07:28.628
Not sure if I want you
handling my cards, friend.

07:29.428 --> 07:31.907
Will you excuse me for a moment?

07:32.007 --> 07:34.047
Dealer change.

07:34.147 --> 07:37.668
Very nice party, Mr. Pope.
You are a very loved man.

07:37.768 --> 07:39.342
Thank you, Mr. Tao.

07:39.442 --> 07:42.286
Whoever said money can't buy love
clearly just didn't have enough.

07:44.039 --> 07:45.674
This place will never be
the same without you.

07:45.774 --> 07:48.076
I feel your absence may change
my luck at the tables.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.737
You got nothing to worry about, Mr. Tao.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.909
Mr. Prince will make sure the Swan's tables
are still the luckiest in the city.

07:53.247 --> 07:54.915
That's all I needed to hear.

07:55.015 --> 07:57.176
- Sorry. Good to see you.
- You need some water?

07:57.276 --> 08:00.050
I'm okay. I just need
a minute in the office.

08:01.620 --> 08:04.384
Mr. Pope? Mr. Pope?

08:04.484 --> 08:05.842
What do you need?

08:05.942 --> 08:08.657
- I'd like to have a word with him.
- Not tonight.

08:28.978 --> 08:30.023
<i>You've reached Sydney.</i>

08:30.123 --> 08:33.731
<i>Please leave your name and number
and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</i>

08:34.399 --> 08:37.351
Hey, Syd, it's me.
I was really hoping to see you tonight.

08:37.451 --> 08:42.564
I know you're busy, but...
give me a call when you get this. Bye.

09:05.776 --> 09:07.343
Carol.

09:19.890 --> 09:22.022
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:22.122 --> 09:24.295
Any changes?

09:25.484 --> 09:27.245
No.

09:33.434 --> 09:38.206
Jesus, Luke. It's not going to cover
what we owe on last month's bill.

09:38.306 --> 09:40.875
I'm doing the best I can, Julie.

09:40.975 --> 09:43.493
What? What is it?

09:43.593 --> 09:47.180
I'm sorry, Mr. Vaughn,
but we've given you ample time.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.999
There comes a time
when we have to accept reality.

09:50.099 --> 09:54.186
So what? I'm supposed to sit by helplessly
and watch my little girl suffer?

09:55.086 --> 09:57.962
We're talking about my little girl here.

09:58.062 --> 10:00.524
You give me until the end of the week.

10:00.624 --> 10:02.292
You understand? You give me
until the end of the week.

10:02.392 --> 10:04.660
- I'll get you every penny by Friday.
- Mr. Vaughn.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.495
- Just listen to me.
- Mr. Vaughn...

10:06.595 --> 10:09.668
Every penny by Friday.
You keep her name on that list.

10:09.768 --> 10:14.287
She's going to get that surgery.
I will get you every penny.

10:14.387 --> 10:15.934
Please.

10:18.103 --> 10:20.480
Friday, Mr. Vaughn.

10:21.815 --> 10:23.596
Friday.

10:29.446 --> 10:35.791
Hey. Talking about Princess Riley here
and her best friend Monkey.

10:35.891 --> 10:38.658
And they were going to go into...

10:38.758 --> 10:41.423
was it a very enchanted magical forest

10:41.523 --> 10:44.092
or was it a very scary forest?

10:44.192 --> 10:47.227
- Scary forest.
- Oh, my goodness. Of course it is.

10:47.327 --> 10:51.270
Okay, so Princess Riley
and her best friend, Monkey...

10:51.370 --> 10:53.165
Stop.

10:53.565 --> 10:57.097
I don't want to be the hero tonight.

10:58.361 --> 11:00.438
But you're the bravest
little girl I know.

11:00.538 --> 11:05.006
I want you to be the hero.
I want you to save me.

11:10.646 --> 11:14.203
Okay. I think that is a great idea.

11:14.938 --> 11:17.472
<i>Princess Riley and Monkey,</i>

11:17.572 --> 11:20.429
<i>they got to the very creaky bridge.</i>

11:20.529 --> 11:24.025
<i>And there's an ogre that comes out
from underneath the bridge.</i>

11:24.125 --> 11:27.818
- <i>What do you think the ogre's name is?</i>
- <i>Luke.</i>

12:42.829 --> 12:44.606
Smoke?

12:45.006 --> 12:48.167
- Nah, I quit.
- Health?

12:48.867 --> 12:52.068
- Money, actually.
- This one's free.

12:57.106 --> 12:58.758
Thank you.

12:58.858 --> 13:01.110
Vaughn, right?

13:03.227 --> 13:05.530
Heard you've been
working here a long time.

13:05.980 --> 13:09.449
- Too long.
- Bet you've seen some crazy shit.

13:10.712 --> 13:12.638
Yeah, man, I've seen some crazy shit.

13:13.018 --> 13:15.654
Been here about three
or four months myself.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.406
And I've seen some crazy shit.

13:17.956 --> 13:21.289
Like this fat Chinese guy
who comes in every week...

13:21.389 --> 13:24.262
biggest fucking loser, this guy.

13:24.362 --> 13:28.066
This guy drops a buttload of money
every Thursday, just like clockwork.

13:28.166 --> 13:30.079
Well...

13:30.179 --> 13:33.803
you play long enough,
the house always wins.

13:35.803 --> 13:37.905
It's the way this guy loses...

13:38.839 --> 13:41.018
<i>making all the wrong bets,</i>

13:41.118 --> 13:44.278
<i>holding when he shouldn't,
not splitting when he should.</i>

13:44.378 --> 13:46.416
<i>Fuckin' guy wants to lose.</i>

13:46.516 --> 13:48.814
<i>Shitload of money, every Thursday night.</i>

13:48.914 --> 13:51.917
<i>Nobody's got that kind
of fuckin' money to burn.</i>

13:52.017 --> 13:53.585
<i>You know what's ever crazier?</i>

13:53.685 --> 13:57.400
<i>Every Friday night, a different Chinese guy
comes to the high-rollers table,</i>

13:57.500 --> 14:00.891
<i>plays roulette, and wins fuckin' huge.</i>

14:01.291 --> 14:04.488
<i>I'm talking statistic-anomaly
fuckin' huge.</i>

14:04.728 --> 14:07.697
<i>Every Friday night,
like fuckin' clockwork.</i>

14:07.797 --> 14:11.000
Why don't you just cut to the chase
and tell me what's on your mind?

14:11.721 --> 14:13.335
The way it appears to me,

14:13.435 --> 14:16.338
is they're taking in a shitload
of money every Thursday night

14:17.362 --> 14:19.778
and laundering it out
through the casino.

14:19.878 --> 14:21.612
You're telling me this because?

14:21.712 --> 14:26.583
Put 'em in an awful bad spot, if someone
were to rob them of that money.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.319
It's not like they're going
to go crying to the police

14:29.419 --> 14:32.223
about someone stealing their dirty cash.

14:33.823 --> 14:36.376
Well, sounds like
you've got this all figured out.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.592
I do, except for one piece.

14:41.049 --> 14:44.089
I need a guy who's been here too long,

14:44.189 --> 14:46.718
smoking habit he can't afford,

14:47.409 --> 14:49.068
and access to the vault.

14:54.673 --> 14:57.977
- Thanks for the cigarette.
- So any thoughts on the matter?

14:59.166 --> 15:02.489
Yeah. Stealing from the Pope...

15:02.589 --> 15:04.682
is suicide.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.905
<i>The number you have reached
is not in service at this time</i>

15:31.005 --> 15:33.373
<i>and there is no new number...</i>

15:34.328 --> 15:36.075
Yeah?

15:36.460 --> 15:40.679
Got that address you wanted.
Also a Luke Vaughn wants a meeting.

15:42.179 --> 15:45.228
All right, send him in. Shit.

15:47.050 --> 15:51.451
Luke Vaughn.
What can I do for you? Sit down.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.620
I was wondering if we
could have a word in private.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.825
Everything we say here is private.

15:58.245 --> 15:59.727
How are you, sir?

16:00.409 --> 16:02.596
I'm still breathing, Vaughn.
Still breathing.

16:02.696 --> 16:05.131
Well, that's good. I suppose
that's more than some can say.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.833
Oh, indeed.
How's that pretty little wife of yours?

16:08.253 --> 16:12.200
- Ex-wife now, actually. She's...
- Well, fuck her. I hope you traded up.

16:14.470 --> 16:18.228
Listen, Mr. Pope. I...
I'm here to ask a favor, a big one.

16:18.328 --> 16:21.577
- How big?
- $300,000 big, at least.

16:21.677 --> 16:23.799
What do you need $300,000
at least for, Vaughn?

16:23.899 --> 16:26.167
You remember my daughter Riley.

16:26.267 --> 16:28.669
She's sick, in the hospital.

16:28.769 --> 16:30.303
- Needs an operation.
- Insurance?

16:30.723 --> 16:33.058
Insurance doesn't even
cover the treatments.

16:33.158 --> 16:36.995
Been paying out of pocket
for a month and I'm behind.

16:37.095 --> 16:41.632
So far behind that if I don't come up with
money by Friday, she's gonna lose her spot.

16:41.732 --> 16:44.418
You know I don't run
a charity here. Rule number 3.

16:44.518 --> 16:47.337
"It's not a business
if you give the money away."

16:47.437 --> 16:48.971
I remember the rules.

16:49.371 --> 16:52.226
This isn't charity. It's a favor.

16:52.326 --> 16:55.443
$300,000 that I'm never going to see
again sure sounds like charity to me.

16:55.543 --> 16:57.634
No, sir. I will pay it back.

16:57.734 --> 16:59.846
I sign your paycheck, Vaughn.
Who are you kidding?

17:01.746 --> 17:05.771
- Mr. Pope, you're my only option.
- I don't make exceptions.

17:05.871 --> 17:07.986
Let me ask you something...
what if it were you?

17:08.086 --> 17:10.588
What if you were in my shoes
and your kid was sick?

17:10.688 --> 17:12.223
- Hey, hey, time's up.
- What if Sydney was sick?

17:12.323 --> 17:14.658
- Nobody's talking to you.
- That's all the time you get.

17:14.758 --> 17:17.427
- No, it's not all the time I get.
- Mr. Pope already answered your question.

17:17.527 --> 17:21.563
I don't accept his fucking answer!
God damn it, get your fuckin' hands off me.

17:21.663 --> 17:23.715
I don't care what you don't accept.
Get the fuck out of here.

17:23.815 --> 17:25.500
What about the shit
that I've done for you?

17:25.600 --> 17:28.569
What do you want? A fuckin' cookie?
What you did for me? You didn't do shit for me.

17:28.669 --> 17:32.046
You fuckin' ran away. I let you go away.
You wanted to start a new life, you found God.

17:32.146 --> 17:34.107
I didn't want my little girl
growing up hating me

17:34.207 --> 17:35.708
- for the man I'd become!
- Get out of here.

17:35.808 --> 17:38.267
You've got what you want,
I got what I want. Go!

17:38.367 --> 17:40.179
- Like you, God damn it! Fuck!
- Move it!

17:40.279 --> 17:43.469
- You're a bad bet!
- Get your fuckin' hands off me.

17:44.547 --> 17:47.715
- Hey!
- Damn it, don't touch me!

17:52.653 --> 17:55.221
You're fuckin' fired.
Get him the fuck out of here.

18:03.028 --> 18:05.597
- That was awkward.
- Yeah, well...

18:05.697 --> 18:07.265
What's with that guy? What's his deal?

18:07.365 --> 18:11.202
That guy would have been you, but he
found love or religion, some bullshit.

18:12.118 --> 18:15.239
He just left everything.
He turned it all down.

18:15.739 --> 18:18.942
<i>I don't know, Derrick. What do you think?
Maybe I should have just given him the money?</i>

18:19.042 --> 18:22.378
<i>I don't think the younger you
would've even considered that an option.</i>

18:22.478 --> 18:24.473
<i>"Don't let sentiment
cloud your judgment.</i>

18:24.573 --> 18:27.148
<i>"Relationships come and go,
but principles...</i>

18:27.248 --> 18:29.775
<i>"principles are here to stay."</i>

18:30.075 --> 18:32.002
Frank Pope.

18:32.602 --> 18:34.852
Glad someone was listening.

18:39.490 --> 18:42.257
Hey, ladies. Looking good.

18:57.906 --> 18:59.559
I'm in.

19:00.569 --> 19:04.070
But I was just fired,
so if you want the vault codes,

19:04.170 --> 19:06.982
it's pretty much going
to have to be tomorrow night.

19:07.584 --> 19:09.482
Let's do it.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.470
Who the fuck are these guys?

19:33.152 --> 19:35.139
My boy Dante.

19:35.239 --> 19:37.107
Mickey.

19:37.207 --> 19:39.041
Hey, man.

19:39.361 --> 19:41.477
This isn't what we agreed to.

19:41.977 --> 19:45.436
I've known this guy since we were kids.
His favorite color is blue.

19:45.536 --> 19:48.750
He lost his virginity to Becky McCormick.
Of course, I fucked her first.

19:48.850 --> 19:51.348
Anything you want to know, just ask.

19:52.048 --> 19:54.487
What's his dick taste like?

19:58.922 --> 20:01.575
Relax. Dante's bringing the guns.

20:01.675 --> 20:04.612
- Mickey's got the car.
- Who said anything about guns?

20:05.162 --> 20:07.665
Feel free to leave yours
with your fuckin' mommy.

20:08.404 --> 20:10.527
I'm not walking in there
with just my dick in my hand.

20:10.627 --> 20:13.007
You do know
who we're dealing with, right?

20:13.107 --> 20:17.938
We go in there with guns,
Pope catches us, we're dead.

20:20.674 --> 20:24.452
It's my operation, Vaughn.
The guns stay.

20:25.510 --> 20:28.282
You don't like it,
take a fuckin' walk right now.

20:28.382 --> 20:32.319
Otherwise, nobody else here
has a problem with it.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.318
So we good?

20:38.488 --> 20:40.702
What's your plan?

20:40.802 --> 20:45.567
Walk in there just after closing,
stick our shotguns in their fuckin' faces.

20:45.667 --> 20:48.264
They'll be all tired and shit.
They're not going to do anything.

20:48.364 --> 20:51.433
Grab the green stacks,
walk the fuck out by dawn.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.512
- Keep it simple.
- Yeah.

20:53.612 --> 20:56.075
Well, simple is usually the best,
but what you've got here

20:56.175 --> 20:58.740
is the simplest way for us
to get our asses shot off.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.207
You got a better fuckin' idea,
we'd love to hear it.

21:13.318 --> 21:15.555
- Swan?
- Swan.

21:15.655 --> 21:19.492
You got the vault, transformer room.
Pepper's the vault.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.570
- Sugar should be the vault.
- What?

21:22.670 --> 21:26.864
It's sweet. Everybody wants it.
Makes sense for the money to be the sugar.

21:28.683 --> 21:31.566
Fine. Sugar's the vault.

21:33.735 --> 21:37.510
Cox, you're the ketchup.
Mickey is Sweet'N Low. I'm the salt.

21:37.610 --> 21:39.878
Dante, you're the pepper.

21:39.978 --> 21:42.827
- Why do I got to be the pepper?
- 'Cause I'm running out of fuckin' condiments.

21:42.977 --> 21:46.279
- Dante, shut the fuck up.
- Nobody steals from the Swan.

21:46.379 --> 21:49.681
But that's because they're afraid
of the Pope, not because it's Fort Knox.

21:49.781 --> 21:52.384
The way I see it,
we've got three things going for us.

21:52.484 --> 21:54.553
One, we have the access codes.
That's on me.

21:54.653 --> 21:57.588
Two, we have the inside man. That's you.

21:57.688 --> 22:00.558
Three, we have knowledge
of a certain security guard

22:00.658 --> 22:04.362
that likes his donuts and coffee
and precisely 3:25 every night.

22:04.662 --> 22:08.332
- Every night?
- Every night. Everybody with me so far?

22:09.404 --> 22:11.924
Mickey, you following me?

22:12.024 --> 22:14.538
Yeah, I'm following you.

22:14.638 --> 22:18.388
This is you with the car. Can I trust
the car won't link back to us?

22:18.708 --> 22:23.579
You're going to pick Dante and I up
right here at this bar at 3:00 a.m.

22:23.679 --> 22:25.501
- Where am I?
- You're at work.

22:25.601 --> 22:29.018
You finish your shift,
clock out, don't leave.

22:29.138 --> 22:31.540
Find your way to the transformer
room and wait.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.009
- Until?
- 3:30.

22:34.109 --> 22:36.711
There'll only be a few employees
hanging around by then.

22:37.629 --> 22:39.653
You... you're going to be
parked up here.

22:39.753 --> 22:41.551
Right by the scrambled eggs. Cool.

22:41.651 --> 22:44.620
This gives you a straight direction
south on the freeway.

22:45.265 --> 22:48.173
- Don't fuck it up.
- You said you got a straight shot,

22:48.273 --> 22:52.176
- not we got a straight shot.
- There is no "we."

22:52.276 --> 22:55.079
We make it out of the Swan alive,

22:55.379 --> 22:58.215
I'm on my own.
You have a problem with that?

22:58.315 --> 23:01.683
As long as we got our money,
I don't give a rat's ass where you go.

23:07.688 --> 23:09.990
Let me know if you need
a quick tutorial.

23:13.128 --> 23:15.151
Where'd you learn to do that?

23:15.631 --> 23:18.232
Fort Beginning for Boys.

23:18.332 --> 23:22.054
- Army?
- Yeah. I served.

23:22.154 --> 23:24.671
The only thing I served
is fries, my friend.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.937
I'd never have guessed.

23:40.584 --> 23:44.284
<i>Dante and I will lock-bump our way
onto the Swan's main floor.</i>

23:44.384 --> 23:48.692
<i>The main casino floor's empty at the time
of night. Everyone goes below to close out.</i>

23:49.980 --> 23:50.894
Go, go, go.

23:51.214 --> 23:54.063
<i>As long as I've known him, good old
Jerry likes to take a leisurely stroll</i>

23:54.163 --> 23:59.100
<i>to the break room for a stale donut
and coffee right at 3:25.</i>

23:59.200 --> 24:02.770
<i>All the inner doors are maglocked
with a three-point security seal.</i>

24:02.870 --> 24:04.818
<i>The vault itself is on a secure circuit.</i>

24:04.918 --> 24:08.670
<i>The rest of the system
is hooked into the ship's old wiring.</i>

24:08.770 --> 24:10.959
<i>So wait for me and Dante
to get into position.</i>

24:11.059 --> 24:14.727
At exactly 3:30 a.m.,
you kill the power.

24:21.284 --> 24:22.753
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

24:22.853 --> 24:25.522
<i>From the time the lights go out,
we have 10 minutes to get in and out</i>

24:25.622 --> 24:29.358
before back-up generators come on
and lock down the ship.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.693
Come on, let's go. Move.

24:31.793 --> 24:34.304
Let's go, let's go.
Quick, come on. Let's go.

24:34.404 --> 24:37.062
This way. Let's hope
this fucking code works.

24:41.286 --> 24:44.100
All right, you motherfucker, unlock.

24:47.739 --> 24:50.575
- What?
- Can you come back later, please?

24:50.975 --> 24:52.860
Thank you.

24:54.544 --> 24:56.209
Let's go!

24:56.309 --> 24:57.764
Move.

24:58.983 --> 25:01.451
Green bags only, dirty stuff.

25:03.115 --> 25:05.791
Let's go, in the bags. Hurry.

25:10.188 --> 25:12.056
No, we're good.

25:24.702 --> 25:25.777
Come on.

25:25.877 --> 25:27.845
- Let's do this.
- Come on.

25:27.945 --> 25:31.079
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, guys, come on.

25:33.816 --> 25:35.395
Come on, come on, come on.

25:39.453 --> 25:41.189
- Fuckin' A!
- Let's go! Quit fuckin' around.

25:41.289 --> 25:44.771
- Let's go, come on. Get the bags.
- That's right.

25:44.871 --> 25:46.494
- That's nice, get out.
- Let's get out.

25:46.594 --> 25:48.993
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go.

25:55.636 --> 25:56.701
Shit.

26:03.975 --> 26:06.178
If something goes bad, what's plan B?

26:06.778 --> 26:08.730
Plan B is run for your fucking life.

26:08.830 --> 26:10.924
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

26:21.122 --> 26:22.938
Shit, shit.

26:23.038 --> 26:24.560
Motherfuckers!

26:32.865 --> 26:35.180
Ready? Go!

26:45.986 --> 26:47.682
Dante!

26:47.782 --> 26:49.758
I got you, man.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.616
I'm getting the fuck out of here.
Come on! Get out of here, Mickey.

26:52.716 --> 26:55.416
Come on, get out of here.
Get the fuck out of here.

26:59.387 --> 27:02.106
Get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here.

27:09.549 --> 27:11.999
What the fuck? Un-fuckin' believable!

27:12.099 --> 27:14.767
- This way, follow me.
- Asshole!

27:14.867 --> 27:16.705
This way! Fuck! Come on.

27:16.805 --> 27:18.599
Let's go, buddy. Come on.

27:20.670 --> 27:23.539
- Fuck!
- Come on, man! Let's get out of here!

27:23.639 --> 27:25.606
- This way!
- Go, go, go, go! Here!

27:30.010 --> 27:32.977
- Morning.
- Yes, it is.

27:44.021 --> 27:45.791
- Ma?
- <i>Hi, honey.</i>

27:45.891 --> 27:49.294
- Mom, what are you doing awake?
- <i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

27:49.394 --> 27:52.597
- Your medication isn't working?
- <i>I haven't taken it yet.</i>

27:52.697 --> 27:55.199
<i>I was thinking of taking
the dog out for a walk.</i>

27:55.299 --> 27:56.967
It's 4:00 a.m., Ma.

27:57.067 --> 28:00.100
- <i>I worry about you.</i>
- I'll be fine.

28:01.969 --> 28:04.239
God damn it, run.

28:07.875 --> 28:09.744
Come on!

28:10.262 --> 28:12.480
All right, I love you.

28:12.580 --> 28:14.048
Good night.

28:15.006 --> 28:16.650
Come on.

28:17.731 --> 28:18.985
Go.

28:19.085 --> 28:21.251
Please, please.

28:24.421 --> 28:28.324
Open the fuckin' door!
Open the fuckin' door!

28:30.218 --> 28:31.295
Let's go!

28:42.969 --> 28:45.231
Close the door and drive.

28:47.472 --> 28:49.408
Let's go!

28:50.519 --> 28:53.259
Everybody be cool.
We'll be out of here in a second.

28:55.178 --> 28:57.011
Cops!

29:02.834 --> 29:05.736
Take your mask off. We gotta blend in.

29:10.274 --> 29:11.799
Fuck.

29:12.676 --> 29:14.545
Everybody act normal, nobody gets hurt.

29:14.965 --> 29:18.800
This is Officer Bauhaus.
Multiple shots fired. I'm in pursuit.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.828
Fuck.

29:56.137 --> 29:59.027
- She wants me to pull over!
- Keep driving.

30:01.994 --> 30:03.640
Fuck this!

30:13.448 --> 30:16.085
Shots fired. In pursuit
of at least one armed suspect.

30:16.185 --> 30:19.102
Don't ever put
your fucking hands on me again.

30:19.202 --> 30:21.456
Pretty sure shooting a cop
is not very good for our situation.

30:21.556 --> 30:23.397
I'm in charge!

30:23.497 --> 30:28.428
- <i>Please describe the bus, over.</i>
- Bus number 657. I repeat, 657.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.496
- I'm in charge.
- Noted.

30:36.867 --> 30:39.771
I'm gonna make this
real fucking simple for you.

30:40.628 --> 30:43.675
Lose that cop,
or lose your goddamn life.

30:43.775 --> 30:46.110
Whatever you say. We're cool.

30:47.210 --> 30:49.813
<i>Calling all units,
possible hostage situation.</i>

30:49.913 --> 30:52.982
<i>Commuter bus... bus number 657.</i>

30:53.082 --> 30:55.918
<i>I repeat, bus 657.</i>

30:56.518 --> 30:59.001
- Head I-10 west.
- Cox, what are you doing?

30:59.101 --> 31:03.254
Improvising. Head I-10 west!
Go that way!

31:08.661 --> 31:11.497
Suspect appears to be headed
towards Interstate 10 onramp, over.

31:11.597 --> 31:13.705
You can't let them get on the highway.

31:13.805 --> 31:16.699
All units, we have suspects
headed towards the Russell onramp.

31:16.799 --> 31:20.136
<i>Set up stingers just west of Waterloo,
right before the onramp.</i>

31:38.353 --> 31:40.323
So what do you suppose
they're up to now?

31:40.423 --> 31:42.939
- Setting up a roadblock.
- How the fuck do you know?

31:43.039 --> 31:46.294
Stop your vehicle.
We're setting up a roadblock.

31:46.394 --> 31:48.366
There's nowhere for you to go.

31:49.784 --> 31:51.896
I need a phone. Who's got a phone?

31:52.798 --> 31:54.331
Who's got a lipstick?

31:59.736 --> 32:01.171
Thank you.

32:01.271 --> 32:03.039
- What's your name?
- Rebecca.

32:03.139 --> 32:05.241
All right, Rebecca.
What's your phone number?

32:05.341 --> 32:07.766
- Get me the fuckin' cops on this thing.
- ...0-1...

32:07.866 --> 32:10.978
- Get me the fuckin' cops on that thing!
- All right, all right, all right!

32:11.078 --> 32:14.081
Dispatch, this is 657.
Put me through to PD.

32:14.381 --> 32:18.952
- <i>Please stand by, bus 657.</i>
- I can't stand by! Patch me through to PD!

32:19.352 --> 32:22.788
- <i>Do you need assistance?</i>
- The fuckin' cops! Quit fucking around!

32:22.888 --> 32:26.225
- I can't wait!
- Hey. I'm gonna need you to back off.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.447
- You know I can't do that.
- Why?

32:28.547 --> 32:31.618
'cause I'm the cop, and you're the robber.
That's the game. It's pretty black and white.

32:31.718 --> 32:33.794
- No gray area?
- No.

32:33.894 --> 32:36.489
Come on. There's always
a gray area, Officer...

32:36.889 --> 32:39.426
- Bauhaus.
- All right, you got a first name?

32:39.726 --> 32:41.158
Cops, now!

32:41.258 --> 32:43.794
- Patch me through to the police.
- Quit fuckin' around!

32:43.894 --> 32:46.419
Kris, I need you to clear the roadblock.

32:46.519 --> 32:49.005
- I need you to pull over.
- Tell them to clear the roadblock!

32:49.105 --> 32:52.184
- Just give me a second. I'm working on it.
- Clear the goddamn roadblock!

32:52.284 --> 32:55.652
Listen to me.
I'm going to need you to trust me.

32:56.345 --> 33:00.407
Kris, I can't help these people on the bus
if you don't give me this one.

33:01.131 --> 33:05.077
Stay right there. Keep your eyes on us.
But I need you to clear that roadblock.

33:05.177 --> 33:08.418
- We gotta get on the Interstate.
- Tell them to clear the roadblock.

33:08.518 --> 33:10.815
- They gotta clear the roadblock!
- You do this for me,

33:10.915 --> 33:13.639
and I promise you, I give you
my word, no one gets hurt.

33:13.739 --> 33:15.617
Tell them that people
are going to start dying.

33:20.056 --> 33:22.659
Captain Michaels,
I need you to remove all roadblocks.

33:22.759 --> 33:25.161
I repeat...
removal of all roadblocks, over.

33:25.261 --> 33:27.329
Negative, Bauhaus,
I'm not letting them on the Interstate.

33:27.429 --> 33:30.798
- But, sir, I have one of...
- <i>The roadblock stays, Bauhaus.</i>

33:31.675 --> 33:33.112
- It's out of my control.
- Kris,

33:33.212 --> 33:37.337
I've got at least 10 people on this bus,
including a little boy and a pregnant girl.

33:37.437 --> 33:39.749
- Tell them to clear the fuckin' roadblock!
- This lunatic?

33:39.849 --> 33:43.641
- I can't control him if this bus stops.
- Tell 'em to clear the roadblock!

33:44.242 --> 33:46.765
You'd better keep your fucking word.

33:56.352 --> 33:58.419
Look out, look out!

34:04.793 --> 34:06.661
Go there!

34:13.315 --> 34:15.936
<i>Kris, are you there? You okay?</i>

34:16.036 --> 34:18.169
Eat a dick.

34:39.087 --> 34:43.359
- You ever try a real cigarette?
- I only smoke vapor, baby.

34:44.461 --> 34:46.764
Used to just roll tobacco in paper,

34:46.864 --> 34:51.034
then enter the filter,
now this vapor bullshit.

34:55.336 --> 34:58.707
If and when you ever have kids, they won't
even know what a real cigarette is.

34:58.807 --> 35:01.159
They'll just think it's something
from old movies.

35:01.259 --> 35:03.394
What are you saying, baby?

35:03.871 --> 35:06.475
Everything dies.

35:06.575 --> 35:08.615
From the moment
something's born or invented,

35:08.715 --> 35:11.684
we're on a one-way course
with obsolescence.

35:11.784 --> 35:14.055
Obso-what?

35:17.320 --> 35:18.553
Yeah?

35:18.653 --> 35:22.412
- Sorry to call you so early.
- <i>No one calls with good news at 5:00 a.m.</i>

35:22.512 --> 35:25.926
Derrick, there's no right way
to break bad news. So how bad is it?

35:34.834 --> 35:36.870
- How much?
- Three mil.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.373
I'm sorry. Maybe I just had
a stroke on my way over here,

35:40.473 --> 35:43.349
'cause I thought
I just heard you say $3 million.

35:43.449 --> 35:46.643
- Yeah.
- Tell me it wasn't the house cash.

35:49.562 --> 35:51.915
- Who?
- Vaughn, two others.

35:52.015 --> 35:53.617
- You sure?
- Positive.

35:55.681 --> 35:58.794
- Where are they?
- They're on a bus.

35:58.894 --> 36:00.903
Let's recap.

36:01.003 --> 36:04.046
A man we fired yesterday
stole $3 million,

36:04.667 --> 36:08.129
that, if recovered by the police, implicates
us in connection to money laundering

36:08.229 --> 36:12.747
for some of the city's most well-known
criminal families. And...

36:12.847 --> 36:16.369
- you let them get on a bus?
- No, I didn't let them. They hijacked it.

36:16.469 --> 36:18.504
The cops got involved.
Then I had to pull back.

36:19.804 --> 36:22.240
- So what are you going to do about it?
- I'm gonna find 'em.

36:22.340 --> 36:25.366
The money will be back
in this vault by tonight.

36:26.004 --> 36:28.185
Good, Derrick.

36:29.093 --> 36:31.344
I believe you.

36:36.249 --> 36:39.784
Now I want to speak with Vaughn
before we finish this.

36:41.837 --> 36:45.153
<i>All right, we are following
this situation of a runaway bus.</i>

36:45.253 --> 36:49.671
<i>Suspected hijackers are on this bus
and there is a very heavy police presence</i>

36:49.771 --> 36:52.596
<i>following the bus down the highway.</i>

37:06.116 --> 37:08.094
Sorry, kiddo.

37:24.994 --> 37:27.071
<i>Bus 657, please respond.</i>

37:27.171 --> 37:31.766
- <i>Bus 657, bus 657? Come in, please.</i>
- Turn that goddamn thing down.

37:41.807 --> 37:44.312
Are you fucking kidding me?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

37:44.412 --> 37:46.480
Give me your goddamn phone.
Did you take my picture, bitch?

37:46.580 --> 37:49.183
- No, I swear.
- Everybody give me your goddamn phones.

37:49.283 --> 37:51.769
Give me your fuckin' phones.
Give me your fuckin' phone.

37:51.869 --> 37:55.106
Give me your goddamn phone.
Put your fuckin' phone in the bag.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.491
No, no, no, me no speak "Engrish."

37:57.591 --> 37:59.794
Oh, no? You speak English now?

37:59.894 --> 38:03.031
Okay, fine, sorry.
Just my whole life is on there, man.

38:03.131 --> 38:04.666
- Give me your phone.
- I'm looking.

38:04.766 --> 38:07.868
- Give me your goddamn phone.
- I'm looking, I'm sorry! I don't know where...

38:13.609 --> 38:15.867
I got it, I got it.

38:25.655 --> 38:27.985
Go ahead, go to him.

38:28.876 --> 38:32.099
- Oh, what the fuck?
- The kid's scared, all right?

38:32.199 --> 38:34.895
I don't give a shit.
Don't move anybody else.

38:35.195 --> 38:38.788
Jesus Christ. You're a real pleasure
to be around, you know that?

38:38.888 --> 38:42.282
All right, everybody,
just stay calm, all right?

38:42.382 --> 38:44.327
I know this isn't
how you want to start your day.

38:44.427 --> 38:47.716
You work with us here, I promise you,
you're going to get off this bus safely.

38:58.108 --> 39:01.680
- How do you feel?
- I'm pretty cold, <i>paisan.</i>

39:02.180 --> 39:04.655
Put some goddamn pressure on it.

39:06.251 --> 39:09.322
All right, listen up!
Anybody here a doctor?

39:09.422 --> 39:14.194
Nurse? EMT? Anybody got any kind
of medical knowledge whatsoever?

39:15.341 --> 39:17.098
I'm a veterinarian student.

39:17.198 --> 39:19.517
- Yeah, bring her up.
- Bring her up? What the fuck?

39:20.151 --> 39:22.268
"Engrish," get your ass
up here and help her.

39:25.138 --> 39:28.310
Okay, okay. I...

39:30.066 --> 39:34.549
Honey, I know this is really scary.
We're going to get off this bus.

39:34.649 --> 39:37.020
They're not going to hurt us.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.624
Is that a rabbit? Does he have a name?

39:41.724 --> 39:44.694
- Big Ear.
- Big Ear?

39:45.894 --> 39:49.966
He used to be Big Ears,
but my sister ripped it.

39:51.669 --> 39:56.124
Well, I think he still looks adorable,
one ear or not.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.660
What's your name, sweetheart?

39:59.010 --> 40:00.859
- Joseph.
- Joseph?

40:00.959 --> 40:03.979
Honey, why are you
all alone on this bus?

40:16.696 --> 40:19.667
- Just keep breathing.
- I can unfuck this.

40:19.767 --> 40:23.772
I know this guy in Texas.
Runs one of those small dirt airfields.

40:23.872 --> 40:27.242
It's right on the border. It's perfect.
We get there, we jump on a plane.

40:27.342 --> 40:31.810
He can take us wherever the fuck we want
to go. South America, Central America.

40:32.780 --> 40:35.783
- Hey.
- What are you doing, man?

40:37.092 --> 40:40.272
- You're going to get us all killed.
- There's three of them and 10 of us.

40:40.372 --> 40:42.193
If we charge them,
they don't stand a chance.

40:42.293 --> 40:45.894
- They've got guns. I'm in a beaver suit.
- So?

40:46.494 --> 40:48.663
- Mexico?
- I didn't say Mexico.

40:48.763 --> 40:52.686
Just on the border. Jump on a plane,
go wherever. It's a plan.

40:52.786 --> 40:56.075
- Why don't we just fucking drive into Mexico?
- We're not going to Mexico.

40:56.275 --> 40:58.578
I'm going to get us out of this shit.

41:05.580 --> 41:07.559
Cox's Sucker!

41:07.660 --> 41:09.509
Jono?

41:12.187 --> 41:15.423
- Sorry we put you in this situation.
- Me too.

41:20.831 --> 41:23.434
- Remember that time you fucked my sister?
- <i>No!</i>

41:23.534 --> 41:26.607
Yeah, that's 'cause it never happened.
If you want it to happen,

41:26.707 --> 41:28.004
you'll do me a favor.

41:32.793 --> 41:35.486
- Is he okay?
- He ran away from home.

41:35.836 --> 41:40.319
His sister picks on him and his parents
take her side every time, apparently.

41:42.719 --> 41:44.521
I hear that.

41:45.244 --> 41:47.259
Move slow, a-hole.

41:47.876 --> 41:50.800
This is not going to end well for you.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.749
Go ahead. Take the shot.

41:52.899 --> 41:55.974
No, I'm not fucking kidding you.
Big-ass bags of money.

41:56.074 --> 41:59.153
Be the hero, man. What if you miss?

41:59.253 --> 42:01.723
Cox is going to turn around,
he's going to shoot immediately.

42:01.823 --> 42:05.741
Maybe he misses, maybe he doesn't.
What if he hits...

42:05.841 --> 42:07.517
- What's your name?
- Pauline.

42:07.617 --> 42:09.873
She for sure is going
to be collateral damage.

42:09.973 --> 42:14.288
And the mascot guy? He's dead.
You're not going to do this.

42:17.927 --> 42:20.499
Be seeing you soon. Three hours out.

42:20.599 --> 42:22.399
- What's your name?
- Eric.

42:22.499 --> 42:24.444
Eric?

42:24.544 --> 42:26.734
Sit in your fuckin' seat.

42:30.173 --> 42:32.410
We're on our way.

42:33.285 --> 42:36.215
- What's going on?
- We need to head to Galveston, Texas.

42:36.315 --> 42:39.016
Galveston? I'll take you
wherever you want, chief.

42:39.116 --> 42:42.353
But we're not even going
to make Slidell on these fumes.

42:45.824 --> 42:48.396
- Cops, this is robbers.
- What the fuck are you doing?

42:48.796 --> 42:51.031
We're out of fuel.

42:54.001 --> 42:56.334
We're ready to make a deal.

42:59.572 --> 43:01.690
Hang tight, man.

43:02.810 --> 43:05.037
You disobeyed a direct order,

43:05.137 --> 43:08.283
endangered not only your life
and the life of your fellow officers,

43:08.383 --> 43:10.886
but dozens of citizens' lives as well.

43:11.186 --> 43:13.421
Anyone dies on that bus and it's on you.

43:13.521 --> 43:15.357
- Hand over your badge and gun.
- But, sir...

43:15.457 --> 43:18.694
I think we're a long fucking way
from "but, sir," Bauhaus.

43:18.794 --> 43:23.014
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
But which of you decided to...

43:23.114 --> 43:28.435
endanger a bus full of civilian hostages
with an unauthorized roadblock?

43:31.206 --> 43:32.943
- You must be he.
- Who the fuck are you?

43:33.043 --> 43:36.113
Detective Marconi, lead investigator
on this little shit show.

43:36.213 --> 43:38.481
I was sent here
by Deputy Chief Braddock,

43:38.581 --> 43:41.585
and chief outranks captain,

43:41.685 --> 43:46.160
so... I officially release you
of your duties and responsibilities

43:46.260 --> 43:48.927
and I officially reinstate you,
Officer Bauhaus.

43:49.027 --> 43:51.622
- Grab your shit, come with me.
- But, detective...

43:51.722 --> 43:55.163
I think we're a long fucking way
from "but, detective," Captain.

43:56.566 --> 43:58.536
That took balls doing what you did.
Why'd you do it?

43:58.636 --> 44:00.238
There's a little kid on that bus, sir.

44:00.338 --> 44:03.441
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but there's still a little kid on that bus.

44:03.541 --> 44:07.711
When I spoke to one of the kidnappers,
there was something protective in his voice.

44:07.811 --> 44:11.616
It was almost like he was thinking
straight, like a cop or a soldier.

44:11.716 --> 44:12.809
Or a sociopath.

44:12.909 --> 44:15.418
- I don't think so, detective.
- You don't think so?

44:15.518 --> 44:17.545
- Call it a gut feeling.
- How many are we dealing with?

44:17.645 --> 44:19.947
At least two, the psycho
and the soldier. Possibly more.

44:20.047 --> 44:23.262
- Great.
- Sir, why did you reinstate me?

44:23.362 --> 44:26.498
I didn't. The hijackers did,
requested you personally.

44:26.598 --> 44:30.035
- Can you drive a fuel truck, Bauhaus?
- Does it have wheels?

44:52.194 --> 44:54.265
You're a real fuckin' moron,
you know that?

44:56.065 --> 44:59.237
Driving the same car to your job
as you drove to a crack house?

44:59.337 --> 45:03.572
- I don't want...
- Shut up. You made it easy for me.

45:04.440 --> 45:07.411
Where they headed?
Did they have an escape plan?

45:07.811 --> 45:10.081
- Some friends? I'm talking to you.
- It's not my...

45:10.181 --> 45:12.437
I'm talking to you.

45:12.541 --> 45:16.221
What you got here? Let me see
what you got. Oh, look at that.

45:17.121 --> 45:18.155
Let me see.

45:18.255 --> 45:20.491
Man, what the fuck...

45:20.591 --> 45:22.571
I'll do...

45:23.795 --> 45:27.465
I don't fuckin' know. I don't know!
I don't fucking know.

45:27.865 --> 45:30.434
- Okay?
- Go ahead.

45:30.534 --> 45:32.504
- Okay.
- Shut up.

45:34.124 --> 45:35.867
- What?
- He doesn't know anything.

45:35.967 --> 45:37.908
What was that?

45:38.208 --> 45:41.546
- Cox, Cox, Cox, Cox!
- Jason Cox?

45:41.646 --> 45:44.918
- Cox said he's going to kill you?
- Cox is going to come.

45:45.018 --> 45:48.151
- Please don't hurt my baby.
- Cox said he's gonna kill him?

45:50.322 --> 45:53.493
Relax, relax, relax. Hey, hey.

45:53.993 --> 45:56.163
Relax. Shut up.

45:58.702 --> 46:02.561
- Please don't kill me.
- Get on your knees, get on your knees.

46:02.661 --> 46:05.971
Please. I'll do anything. Please...

46:10.477 --> 46:13.883
All right, boys. That bus is going
to stop on that fuckin' bridge.

46:13.983 --> 46:17.620
- So what are our options?
- We could hit 'em hard with tear gas.

46:18.320 --> 46:21.890
I'm not ready to gas civilians
on live television, but thanks for playing.

46:21.990 --> 46:23.889
- Full-on assault.
- Civilian casualties?

46:23.989 --> 46:26.833
Inevitable in that scenario,
but manageable.

46:26.933 --> 46:29.353
- Snipers?
- We're going to need two clean shots,

46:29.453 --> 46:31.458
lined up from the air.
But it's going to be risky.

46:31.558 --> 46:34.238
All right, start mapping out
the assault just in case.

46:34.338 --> 46:38.042
In the meantime, get our best guys in that
chopper. They get a clean shot, we take it.

46:38.142 --> 46:40.079
- Roger that.
- You heard him. Let's move.

46:40.179 --> 46:44.183
All right, Bauhaus! You good?
You're working the hell out of that vest.

46:44.283 --> 46:47.253
Stay alert, stay alive...

46:47.516 --> 46:49.155
make note of anything useful.

46:49.255 --> 46:52.527
And if you can,
get us a clean visual on the gunman.

46:53.927 --> 46:55.059
Copy that.

47:04.938 --> 47:09.594
No. Hell no. Give 'em old man death
and that green-haired hooker back there.

47:10.044 --> 47:12.648
Look, we give 'em the kid
and that woman,

47:12.948 --> 47:16.013
they think we're reasonable, they see it
as a victory, it buys us more time.

47:16.113 --> 47:18.555
No. If we keep
the pregnant chick and the kid,

47:18.655 --> 47:20.971
it gives us more leverage
if shit goes bad.

47:21.071 --> 47:23.326
We have one medical emergency
onboard already.

47:23.426 --> 47:26.980
If that chick goes into labor,
they storm the bus, hostages be damned.

47:27.080 --> 47:31.200
All they're going to give a crap about is
saving that baby in time for the 6:00 news.

47:33.837 --> 47:35.504
We're at the bridge!

47:44.849 --> 47:48.221
Talk to me, Forbes.
You got your boys in position?

47:48.721 --> 47:52.225
<i>We have eyes on the prize, sir.
Bus is heading into position.</i>

47:53.325 --> 47:56.460
- <i>This is all you, Bauhaus.</i>
- Copy that.

48:03.602 --> 48:07.073
<i>Bus has stopped. Bus has stopped.</i>

48:22.792 --> 48:26.464
<i>Three people leaving the bus.
One suspect, one woman and a kid.</i>

48:27.164 --> 48:28.900
You got a clear shot?

48:29.000 --> 48:32.008
<i>Negative, too many bogeys,
too many bogeys. Come back around.</i>

48:45.150 --> 48:49.340
<i>Suspect one by the fuel tank.
That's too risky. May ignite.</i>

48:49.440 --> 48:51.875
So what's the big plan?

48:52.026 --> 48:54.541
I don't know that I have one.

48:54.641 --> 48:57.466
Maybe start a bus company
and go head-to-head with Greyhound.

48:57.566 --> 49:00.536
Or you could turn yourself in and let
the rest of the people off the bus.

49:00.836 --> 49:04.273
I can't do that yet, Kris.
Hopefully soon.

49:04.373 --> 49:07.510
What about their families?
What about your family?

49:08.265 --> 49:11.298
There's got to be someone
out there that cares about you.

49:11.398 --> 49:13.784
I could find them, bring them here.

49:14.782 --> 49:17.153
I just need your name.

49:18.379 --> 49:20.723
Good try, officer.

49:21.542 --> 49:25.664
All right. Well... well, at least
let me check out the hostages.

49:26.164 --> 49:28.781
You keep putting the gas in the tank,
you can do whatever you want.

49:28.881 --> 49:32.336
<i>They're heading into the bus, sir.
No visual on the second gunman.</i>

49:36.307 --> 49:38.648
What the fuck are you thinking,
bringing a cop on the bus?

49:38.748 --> 49:42.524
Relax. She just wants to make sure everybody's
all right, we haven't hurt anybody.

49:42.724 --> 49:44.310
- One of yours?
- Yeah.

49:44.410 --> 49:47.026
He needs medical attention.
Let me take him out of here.

49:47.126 --> 49:51.122
You're not taking him anywhere.
You're going to get your ass off the bus.

49:57.028 --> 50:01.035
I always thought there was nothing sexier
than a woman who fought back.

50:01.835 --> 50:03.944
Make one more fuckin' move.

50:04.044 --> 50:05.738
D...

50:05.838 --> 50:08.460
if this bitch shoots me,

50:08.560 --> 50:10.877
kill her and everybody else
on this fucking bus.

50:12.497 --> 50:14.998
- You got it, pal.
- All right, Kris.

50:15.671 --> 50:18.220
Tell your boss that everybody's okay.

50:18.420 --> 50:20.819
Fucking bitch.

50:22.768 --> 50:26.893
<i>Sir, suspect one and Officer Bauhaus
have exited the bus.</i>

50:38.040 --> 50:39.341
<i>You got eyes on the other perp?</i>

50:39.441 --> 50:42.344
<i>Negative, sir. But we have
a clean shot at suspect one.</i>

50:42.594 --> 50:45.030
I don't know why you're doing this,
but let me help you.

50:45.380 --> 50:49.685
- Let me help you with your problems.
- You have no idea what my problems are.

50:49.785 --> 50:52.722
Come on! Let's get the fuck out of here!

50:53.522 --> 50:58.133
If you get a minute and have a chance,
will you let me know how the girl is?

50:59.563 --> 51:03.719
<i>Sir, should we take a shot?
It's now or never, sir. I have him.</i>

51:03.819 --> 51:06.035
<i>Abort. Abort, let him go.</i>

51:19.317 --> 51:21.655
Go for Marconi. This is Officer Bauhaus.

51:21.755 --> 51:25.087
<i>Well done, Bauhaus.
What have you got for me?</i>

51:27.238 --> 51:28.828
<i>...proceeding toward Texas.</i>

51:33.434 --> 51:37.519
Here you are. There you go. Enjoy.

51:38.191 --> 51:40.093
Can I help...

51:41.404 --> 51:43.613
You're a hard girl to find, Syd.

51:43.713 --> 51:47.050
- What are you doing here, Dad?
- What? A father can't look for his daughter?

51:47.450 --> 51:51.052
And then find her in some grimy shelter?

51:52.355 --> 51:55.794
- Missed you at the party.
- I was busy.

51:56.094 --> 51:58.963
- You know I'm leaving town?
- Good for you.

51:59.064 --> 52:02.735
- I'm not sure how long.
- Need me to water your plants, feed the cat?

52:02.835 --> 52:05.601
I was hoping to give you something.

52:12.080 --> 52:15.166
This says you own 51% of the Swan.

52:15.666 --> 52:18.353
Derrick will run the whole thing.
You won't have to lift a finger.

52:19.193 --> 52:22.023
The money will just be in a trust,
with you as the sole beneficiary.

52:22.123 --> 52:25.394
You can't buy me.

52:26.323 --> 52:28.874
- I don't want your money.
- Sydney...

52:28.974 --> 52:32.111
Dad, I know how this money is made.

52:32.211 --> 52:34.905
Oh, come on, don't be so naive.
Nothing's that black and white.

52:35.005 --> 52:37.780
- This money's as clean as the rest.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.976
This empire you've carved out
for yourself...

52:40.076 --> 52:43.963
- For you.
- For yourself, it has a price.

52:44.063 --> 52:49.169
- It cost you your wife and it cost you me.
- Sydney, please, just sign the paperwork.

52:49.269 --> 52:52.335
- I just want you to have it.
- Why the urgency? Why now?

52:57.792 --> 52:59.427
What?

53:02.048 --> 53:06.958
- What's the trick?
- There's no trick. It's in my...

53:11.020 --> 53:13.291
Are you dying?

53:15.328 --> 53:19.200
It's in my lungs, my blood, my bones.

53:19.300 --> 53:21.835
Nothing they can do, so...

53:23.949 --> 53:28.441
And you're leaving, and you think
this might be the last time you see me.

53:31.044 --> 53:33.216
You always were a smart one, Syd.

53:41.220 --> 53:44.392
Then you should hear this
before you walk out that door.

53:45.092 --> 53:49.615
You want to give me your empire,
your beloved Swan?

53:50.398 --> 53:54.536
That place, that boat,
that's been a cancer for me

53:54.636 --> 53:59.111
and for Mom and for everything
good inside of you.

53:59.211 --> 54:02.512
That's what you're going to be
leaving behind in this world.

54:02.612 --> 54:08.350
That's your legacy. If you love me,
if you ever really loved me,

54:09.021 --> 54:12.456
you would take it and you would
burn it all to the ground.

54:12.556 --> 54:15.358
You're not making any sense, Syd.

54:15.458 --> 54:19.764
- This is real...
- Love is built on sacrifice,

54:20.464 --> 54:22.233
not dollars.

54:23.434 --> 54:25.868
What can I do to fix it?

54:44.226 --> 54:47.330
Oh, my God! Joseph! Joseph!

54:48.430 --> 54:52.870
So, are there any names you can remember?
Any details at all?

54:53.702 --> 54:58.644
Yeah, they kept calling the one guy,
the... crazy one, Cox.

54:58.744 --> 55:02.148
Cox? Did they mention
anything about a destination?

55:02.248 --> 55:06.919
- Maybe why they hijacked the bus?
- I think they were being chased.

55:07.019 --> 55:09.489
- Chased by who?
- I don't know.

55:09.889 --> 55:11.657
Did you see anyone chasing them?

55:11.757 --> 55:15.428
I didn't, but they were
running and sweaty,

55:15.528 --> 55:19.166
and they kept looking out the window.
So, I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

55:19.266 --> 55:21.205
How's that?

55:21.605 --> 55:24.740
- That's perfect. What do you think?
- It's pretty... it's pretty close.

55:25.040 --> 55:28.280
- I'll go run a search.
- Thanks, Dan.

55:28.380 --> 55:32.513
Listen, is this going to take much longer?
There's just somewhere I really need to be.

55:32.613 --> 55:35.083
All right. Well, yeah, we're done here.

55:35.183 --> 55:38.487
We'll be in contact if we need
anything else. So thank you for your time.

55:38.587 --> 55:42.635
- Of course. Anything I can do to help.
- Okay, bye.

55:53.641 --> 55:56.490
Hello there, soldier boy.

56:05.951 --> 56:07.522
Is that your kid?

56:07.622 --> 56:11.826
Yup. Two tours, Iraq, one Afghanistan.

56:11.926 --> 56:14.963
He's a company commander now,
stationed in Italy.

56:15.063 --> 56:16.765
That's a good assignment.

56:16.865 --> 56:18.900
You serve?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.737
I did, a long time ago.

56:21.837 --> 56:24.104
I thought they trained you guys
to be heroes.

56:26.074 --> 56:31.029
Well, I seem to letting everyone down
in that department lately.

56:32.582 --> 56:36.586
Everything's going to be okay.
I need you to keep breathing, okay?

56:37.986 --> 56:41.189
- What's your name?
- Rebecca.

56:42.558 --> 56:44.526
Thank you.

56:46.663 --> 56:49.821
- If I die...
- You're not going to die.

56:49.921 --> 56:51.850
I just...

56:53.562 --> 56:55.670
I'm sorry.

56:58.608 --> 57:03.185
I'm gonna be right back.
Tom, apply pressure here.

57:06.850 --> 57:09.521
So... where's my apology?

57:11.300 --> 57:12.958
You got tits?

57:13.058 --> 57:15.126
- No.
- Then go fuck yourself.

57:17.328 --> 57:21.381
My name is Jason Cox. My bill was
slightly higher than usual this month.

57:21.481 --> 57:24.503
I believe my son has been using
my cell phone to call his girlfriend,

57:24.603 --> 57:26.406
who unfortunately moved to Texas.

57:26.506 --> 57:30.113
Have there been any outgoing calls
to Texas within the past week or so?

57:30.213 --> 57:33.158
<i>I'll just need the last four
of your social in order to proceed.</i>

57:33.258 --> 57:36.683
Sure, no problem. One-one-two-zero.

57:36.783 --> 57:41.386
<i>Yes, sir. Several calls to Galveston,
Texas. 405-5...</i>

57:58.837 --> 58:00.506
Yeah. Tell me something good.

58:00.606 --> 58:04.476
Looks like they're headed to Texas,
making a run for the border or some shit.

58:04.576 --> 58:05.562
Cliché.

58:05.662 --> 58:08.014
I'm gonna send one of our guys
out to pick up Vaughn's daughter.

58:08.114 --> 58:10.517
- That way we can do an exchange.
- No, no, no, no.

58:10.617 --> 58:13.988
- What, no exchange?
- No daughter, Derrick. No daughter.

58:15.127 --> 58:17.292
Mr. Pope, I think this is
just our best chance to...

58:17.392 --> 58:20.689
Let me make this clear, we are not going
to kidnap a bedridden little girl

58:20.789 --> 58:23.128
with fucking cancer. You're not going
to touch a hair of her head.

58:23.228 --> 58:25.568
If there's any fucking hair left
on that poor little girl's head.

58:25.668 --> 58:27.804
<i>You're gonna leave her alone,
you're gonna leave her mom alone.</i>

58:27.904 --> 58:30.841
And if she has a fucking teddy bear, you're
going to leave the teddy bear alone as well.

58:30.941 --> 58:34.744
Our problem's with Vaughn, not them.
Is that understood?

58:35.504 --> 58:37.180
Is that understood?

58:38.335 --> 58:42.251
- Understood.
- Now get me my money back.

58:48.701 --> 58:51.755
Galveston Air Cargo, Jono speaking.

59:05.743 --> 59:08.948
<i>Anyone there?
Hey, cocksuckers, someone pick up.</i>

59:09.048 --> 59:11.982
<i>Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up.</i>

59:13.252 --> 59:14.300
Detective?

59:14.600 --> 59:17.192
So how about it? A little
<i>mano-y-mano</i> meet and greet?

59:17.292 --> 59:19.226
What makes you think we want to do that?

59:19.326 --> 59:21.569
<i>I hear your</i> compadre
<i>isn't doing too good.</i>

59:21.669 --> 59:25.700
Word on the street is he's having
a serious allergic reaction to bullets.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.002
<i>Come on, let me get him some medical
supplies. At least give him a chance.</i>

59:34.206 --> 59:36.508
Get back to you in a minute.

59:39.913 --> 59:42.919
- How's he doing?
- He's fucking dying.

59:45.068 --> 59:51.255
He needs blood. If not blood, he needs
fluids, IV, something, or he's gonna die.

59:51.355 --> 59:54.532
- He needs a hospital, man.
- Not going to the fucking hospital.

59:54.632 --> 59:58.570
- You want him to die?
- What the fuck you just ask me?

59:58.870 --> 1:00:00.892
You listen to me, motherfucker,

1:00:01.092 --> 1:00:03.911
that guy, dying,

1:00:04.011 --> 1:00:07.480
we grew up together. He's the only
fucking friend I've ever had.

1:00:07.580 --> 1:00:10.851
So don't fucking ask me
if I want him to die!

1:00:11.251 --> 1:00:14.455
I don't want to die, man.
I don't want to die.

1:00:14.555 --> 1:00:16.823
If we get you the shit you need,
can you keep him alive?

1:00:16.923 --> 1:00:20.961
Hey, fucking IV shit? We get it,
can you keep him alive? Yes or no?

1:00:21.061 --> 1:00:24.462
Definitely for longer,
but I don't know how long.

1:00:30.670 --> 1:00:32.174
You there?

1:00:32.274 --> 1:00:34.142
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:00:34.842 --> 1:00:37.779
All right, we need to get IVs,

1:00:37.879 --> 1:00:41.449
pain meds, bandages, clotting agents.
Can you do that?

1:00:41.549 --> 1:00:45.987
I can get all that for you.
I just need to deliver it in person.

1:00:47.087 --> 1:00:49.357
Of course you do.

1:00:49.457 --> 1:00:52.461
Here's the catch...
we're not stopping the bus.

1:00:52.561 --> 1:00:53.995
I can work with that.

1:00:57.032 --> 1:00:58.535
<i>Go for Marconi.</i>

1:00:58.635 --> 1:01:01.640
- Detective Marconi, this is Officer Bauhaus.
- What you got?

1:01:01.740 --> 1:01:05.683
I've got an ID on one of the hijackers,
a Luke Vaughn.

1:01:05.783 --> 1:01:08.306
Looks like he did some time
in Bibb's Correctional

1:01:08.406 --> 1:01:10.831
- <i>and served in the army.</i>
- You get an address?

1:01:10.931 --> 1:01:14.870
I'm actually standing out front right now.
Looks like he was evicted.

1:01:14.970 --> 1:01:18.256
- Neighbors say he moved in with his sister.
- Any ID on the sister?

1:01:18.356 --> 1:01:20.992
No, no one...
no one knows anything about her.

1:01:21.092 --> 1:01:23.298
Well, it's a start. Anything else?

1:01:23.398 --> 1:01:25.730
I was thinking about
heading over to this Swan Casino.

1:01:25.831 --> 1:01:28.994
Vaughn works there. I don't know.
Ask a few questions, check it out.

1:01:29.094 --> 1:01:31.769
No, no, no. I'll send one of my guys.
Okay? You just...

1:01:31.869 --> 1:01:34.119
You've had a rough one, Bauhaus. Just...

1:01:34.219 --> 1:01:38.090
<i>hang at the station.
I'll hit you back when I need you.</i>

1:02:05.290 --> 1:02:09.162
- Get started.
- Okay. Okay. Tom?

1:02:09.263 --> 1:02:11.699
- Nice little party you got here.
- Hold this.

1:02:11.799 --> 1:02:16.617
- Lucky there's a doctor on the bus.
- She's not a doctor. She's a vet student.

1:02:16.717 --> 1:02:18.609
Not so lucky then.

1:02:19.673 --> 1:02:21.130
What's this?

1:02:21.230 --> 1:02:23.779
- Pain meds.
- Right. Okay.

1:02:23.879 --> 1:02:27.080
Careful. I have thin veins.

1:02:37.441 --> 1:02:41.590
- Holy shit, he's dead!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1:02:41.990 --> 1:02:46.068
What the fuck do you mean, he's dead?
What the fuck do you mean, he's dead?

1:02:47.735 --> 1:02:51.063
- What the fuck did you do?
- Ask the vet.

1:02:51.163 --> 1:02:54.378
- What the fuck you do, bitch?
- I didn't do... I didn't do anything!

1:02:54.478 --> 1:02:56.781
- I didn't do anything!
- Well, you'd better do something!

1:02:56.881 --> 1:03:00.213
- Do CPR, something! Work on him!
- It wasn't her.

1:03:02.152 --> 1:03:04.755
Okay, what's in the bag?

1:03:05.796 --> 1:03:07.866
Tom, check his pulse!

1:03:08.766 --> 1:03:10.596
I think it's for you.

1:03:10.996 --> 1:03:12.795
Don't die.

1:03:17.878 --> 1:03:19.041
Mr. Pope?

1:03:19.141 --> 1:03:22.931
You know, I see you every day, every day
on that floor for the past five years.

1:03:23.606 --> 1:03:28.907
And every day I think to myself, "Today's
the day Luke is going to come to the office,

1:03:29.007 --> 1:03:31.322
ask to come back."

1:03:31.876 --> 1:03:33.489
That day never comes.

1:03:35.491 --> 1:03:38.408
This isn't how I wanted it to go down.

1:03:38.508 --> 1:03:42.244
I know, but we do have a bit of a situation
on our hands. Wouldn't you say?

1:03:42.344 --> 1:03:45.504
Yeah. There doesn't seem
to be a whole lot of out.

1:03:45.604 --> 1:03:48.808
<i>Well, here's one you might not
have considered. Put a bullet in Cox,</i>

1:03:48.908 --> 1:03:51.578
<i>throw yourself and my money
into the man standing in front of you.</i>

1:03:51.678 --> 1:03:55.281
Everyone gets off the bus. No one knows
about my money or its origins.

1:03:55.381 --> 1:03:58.017
You get carted off to jail.
Except you never make it.

1:03:58.117 --> 1:04:01.021
Instead, you disappear
with enough cash to save Riley

1:04:01.121 --> 1:04:05.926
- <i>and start a new life far away from here.</i>
- I wish I could believe you, Mr. Pope.

1:04:06.426 --> 1:04:09.596
But you and I both know
you're a man that lives by his rules.

1:04:09.696 --> 1:04:12.419
I'd make an exception for an old friend.

1:04:12.519 --> 1:04:14.801
But this is a right-now,
one-time deal only, pal.

1:04:14.902 --> 1:04:17.701
You need to fold your hand,
walk away from the table,

1:04:17.801 --> 1:04:21.368
- <i>or I'm taking your whole stack.</i>
- I appreciate the out.

1:04:21.968 --> 1:04:24.910
You and I both know
that's a sucker's bet.

1:04:25.010 --> 1:04:27.740
You don't make exceptions.

1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:31.159
Sorry. No deal.

1:04:34.121 --> 1:04:35.923
Me too.

1:04:47.837 --> 1:04:49.441
No deal.

1:04:49.541 --> 1:04:52.777
- What the fuck's going on?
- Detective Marconi here...

1:04:52.877 --> 1:04:54.778
is in Mr. Pope's back pocket.

1:04:56.860 --> 1:04:58.774
What'd you do?

1:04:58.874 --> 1:05:01.363
What the fuck did you do?

1:05:02.391 --> 1:05:06.392
Did you kill my friend, you piece
of shit? Is that what you did?

1:05:06.492 --> 1:05:08.691
You kill my fucking friend?

1:05:12.725 --> 1:05:13.968
Fucker!

1:05:14.868 --> 1:05:18.778
- What the fuck are you doing, Vaughn?
- No, you can't kill him. Just listen to me.

1:05:18.878 --> 1:05:22.763
To us, he's Pope's errand boy.
To the rest of the world, he's a cop.

1:05:22.863 --> 1:05:26.530
We kill a cop, the whole world
comes crashing down on us.

1:05:28.616 --> 1:05:32.453
Get him off this fucking bus
or I'm gonna kill him!

1:05:37.994 --> 1:05:41.262
<i>Something is happening.
This is the bus 657 hostage situation.</i>

1:05:41.362 --> 1:05:44.368
<i>It appears that the bus
is slowing down now</i>

1:05:44.468 --> 1:05:46.604
<i>and the doors are opening.</i>

1:05:46.704 --> 1:05:50.708
<i>We're seeing now... Oh, my goodness.</i>

1:05:59.073 --> 1:06:01.771
Catch these motherfuckers!

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:28.350
- We've got a problem.
- What do you see?

1:06:30.319 --> 1:06:31.823
SWAT bikes.

1:06:31.923 --> 1:06:34.355
Everybody get down! On the floor!

1:06:37.759 --> 1:06:40.076
Coming up on both sides.

1:06:43.332 --> 1:06:45.999
Gas! Get on the floor!

1:06:56.344 --> 1:06:58.512
I can't see anything!

1:07:01.482 --> 1:07:03.751
Everybody get down!

1:07:23.707 --> 1:07:26.744
- They're on the roof!
- They're on the fucking roof!

1:08:07.194 --> 1:08:10.063
- Motherfucker!
- Get behind the yellow line!

1:08:19.675 --> 1:08:21.278
Get off the road!

1:08:23.728 --> 1:08:25.179
I can't hold it!

1:08:36.526 --> 1:08:37.960
He blew out a tire!

1:08:40.697 --> 1:08:43.231
- I can't control it!
- Go left!

1:08:52.743 --> 1:08:57.006
<i>Bus 657 has crashed just outside
of Galveston, Texas, as the police...</i>

1:08:57.106 --> 1:08:59.602
Oh, fuck!

1:09:09.634 --> 1:09:12.193
Stay below the window line.

1:09:12.642 --> 1:09:14.510
Stay down.

1:09:15.703 --> 1:09:18.033
What the fuck are you doing?

1:09:18.133 --> 1:09:22.212
- Let's go! Come on!
- Move, move!

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:30.801
We're surrounded. We're sitting ducks.

1:09:30.901 --> 1:09:34.141
Oh, what'd you do now, boy?

1:09:35.337 --> 1:09:37.611
Black out the fucking window, man.

1:09:38.997 --> 1:09:41.022
You got any more paint?

1:09:43.701 --> 1:09:45.870
Flies around shit.

1:09:47.572 --> 1:09:49.943
<i>...to interrupt here,
but we do need to go to a live...</i>

1:09:50.343 --> 1:09:52.097
So what's the plan, detective?

1:09:52.197 --> 1:09:54.380
One wrong move,
we're 10 million hits on YouTube.

1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:56.950
Call your sniper section. I want
your boys in position 10 minutes ago.

1:09:57.050 --> 1:10:00.686
Roger that. Snipers, get in position.

1:10:02.621 --> 1:10:05.293
Get the the fuckin' news on the phone.

1:10:06.293 --> 1:10:08.829
Get the fuckin' news on the phone!

1:10:09.370 --> 1:10:11.756
- Cox, what the fuck are you doing?
- I want my 15 seconds of fame.

1:10:11.856 --> 1:10:14.579
Cox, Cox, what the fuck are you doing?

1:10:16.365 --> 1:10:18.106
- You don't have to do this!
- What are you doing?

1:10:18.206 --> 1:10:20.972
- You don't have to do this!
- Shut the fuck up!

1:10:22.276 --> 1:10:24.179
- You got 'em?
- Please, Mr. Cox...

1:10:24.279 --> 1:10:26.849
You got 'em? They on the phone?

1:10:26.949 --> 1:10:29.129
Cox, what are you doing, man?

1:10:29.429 --> 1:10:33.523
- I think you need to see this.
- <i>...bus 657 hostage situation</i>

1:10:33.623 --> 1:10:37.997
<i>where we have one of the hijackers
on the line, ready to speak with us.</i>

1:10:38.297 --> 1:10:40.287
<i>Go ahead, live on the air.</i>

1:10:40.387 --> 1:10:44.406
Tell the cops to back off!
I'll kill this motherfucker!

1:10:44.506 --> 1:10:47.804
I'm gonna kill him and everybody
on this goddamn bus!

1:10:48.004 --> 1:10:51.141
He's not going to kill a hostage
on live TV. Prepare to board the bus.

1:10:51.241 --> 1:10:52.742
- Sir?
- Do it!

1:10:52.842 --> 1:10:54.144
Please, don't. Please.

1:10:54.244 --> 1:10:56.786
- Shut up, shut up.
- Come on, man. Please.

1:11:00.883 --> 1:11:02.486
- Cox...
- Tell the cops to back off!

1:11:02.586 --> 1:11:03.687
- Cox...
- Shut the fuck up.

1:11:03.788 --> 1:11:07.090
Cox, we're not going to play it this way.
We can't do this. You can't kill him!

1:11:07.190 --> 1:11:08.872
- Please, please.
- Shut the fuck up!

1:11:08.972 --> 1:11:11.027
Don't shoot me.

1:11:11.727 --> 1:11:15.325
- You got a clear shot?
- <i>Negative, sir. I only see the hostage.</i>

1:11:15.435 --> 1:11:18.430
This death is on that man's conscience,
not mine!

1:11:18.530 --> 1:11:21.103
- No. No.
- I'm in charge. I'm in charge!

1:11:23.607 --> 1:11:25.611
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1:11:25.811 --> 1:11:27.079
Fuck!

1:11:27.979 --> 1:11:30.930
All units withdraw.
I repeat, all units withdraw.

1:11:31.030 --> 1:11:34.434
<i>I would like to apologize
to our viewers for that.</i>

1:11:34.534 --> 1:11:36.404
<i>I do not know what to say.</i>

1:11:36.504 --> 1:11:38.794
- It's a very... grave situation.
- This is unprecedented.

1:11:38.894 --> 1:11:41.140
- We will continue to learn more on this.
- We apologize.

1:11:47.079 --> 1:11:49.615
That should have never happened.

1:12:02.496 --> 1:12:05.799
- Hello.
- <i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

1:12:08.034 --> 1:12:10.200
Princess.

1:12:10.900 --> 1:12:14.175
What are you doing? Is everything okay?

1:12:14.575 --> 1:12:15.759
I'm fine, Dad.

1:12:15.859 --> 1:12:20.949
The nice policewoman said over here
that you're being a real, real hero.

1:12:21.049 --> 1:12:23.550
<i>I'm proud of you, Dad.</i>

1:12:25.140 --> 1:12:28.155
I love you so much. You know that?

1:12:29.891 --> 1:12:31.844
All Daddy wants to do...

1:12:31.944 --> 1:12:35.833
is to make everything okay for you.
I just want you to feel better.

1:12:37.617 --> 1:12:40.561
If I could take all your pain away

1:12:40.661 --> 1:12:42.842
and make it mine,

1:12:42.942 --> 1:12:44.675
I would. You know that?

1:12:44.775 --> 1:12:48.409
I know that, Dad. I love you too.

1:12:48.962 --> 1:12:52.615
- I'm gonna see you real soon, okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

1:12:56.451 --> 1:13:00.091
I know about the bills.
I know about the surgery.

1:13:00.191 --> 1:13:02.681
<i>You're not going to be able to get
that money here on time, Vaughn.</i>

1:13:02.781 --> 1:13:05.296
She is going to lose her spot.

1:13:07.095 --> 1:13:08.967
I'll have that money there by 7:00.

1:13:09.067 --> 1:13:11.170
<i>You and your psycho friend
just killed a hostage.</i>

1:13:11.270 --> 1:13:13.721
So for the sake of your daughter...

1:13:14.174 --> 1:13:16.075
<i>give yourself up.</i>

1:13:16.175 --> 1:13:19.512
You have no idea
what's really going on here.

1:13:20.128 --> 1:13:23.203
- It's not what it seems.
- <i>Yeah, well, it all seems pretty fucked.</i>

1:13:23.583 --> 1:13:27.187
And unless that bus grows wings, you ain't
got a hope in shit to make it anyways.

1:13:27.287 --> 1:13:30.589
The only way off that bus
is with your hands up, man.

1:13:39.287 --> 1:13:44.376
<i>The wheels on the bus go round and round</i>

1:13:45.035 --> 1:13:47.862
<i>Round and round</i>

1:13:47.962 --> 1:13:49.580
<i>Round and round</i>

1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:55.784
<i>The wheels on the bus go round and round</i>

1:13:56.630 --> 1:14:01.595
<i>All day long</i>

1:14:03.593 --> 1:14:07.062
God damn it!
Get me off this fuckin' bus!

1:14:08.333 --> 1:14:11.837
Fuck! God! Fuck!

1:14:11.937 --> 1:14:14.398
Get me out of here!

1:14:18.350 --> 1:14:20.362
I got an idea.

1:14:25.316 --> 1:14:26.704
All right, detective, here's the deal.

1:14:26.804 --> 1:14:30.391
No more games. You fix the tire,
I release all the hostages but one.

1:14:30.491 --> 1:14:33.728
Once I get where I'm going,
I release the last hostage.

1:14:33.828 --> 1:14:37.032
Nobody follows us.
I see someone follow us...

1:14:37.132 --> 1:14:41.694
choppers, police escort...
I kill another fucking hostage.

1:14:41.794 --> 1:14:45.571
What do you think, detective?
This gonna work for you?

1:14:47.608 --> 1:14:49.378
Deal.

1:14:49.878 --> 1:14:52.738
<i>Sending in a mechanic,
the bus is being repaired.</i>

1:14:52.838 --> 1:14:56.183
<i>And it appears we're close
to a resolution.</i>

1:14:56.695 --> 1:14:57.654
Go.

1:14:57.754 --> 1:15:00.636
<i>I spoke to your guys and they're
in position. So once the bus pulls out,</i>

1:15:00.936 --> 1:15:03.180
it'll just be me
and your guys out there.

1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:05.995
We'll take the bus,
I'll put a bullet in Vaughn.

1:15:06.095 --> 1:15:07.397
I'll get your money.

1:15:07.497 --> 1:15:11.165
Sounds like a plan. Don't fuck it up.

1:15:14.470 --> 1:15:20.076
<i>All right, it appears that some of
the hostages are coming off of the bus now.</i>

1:15:41.369 --> 1:15:45.542
<i>One hostage remains on the bus,
which now appears to be departing.</i>

1:15:45.642 --> 1:15:49.261
<i>The police have ordered
news choppers not to follow.</i>

1:16:49.585 --> 1:16:53.123
That'll be $1.25, gentlemen.

1:17:18.954 --> 1:17:22.348
Hey, Cox's Sucker!
She's ready and waiting, my brother.

1:17:22.448 --> 1:17:24.028
He's a little indisposed at the moment.

1:17:24.128 --> 1:17:26.631
Wanted me to call and tell you
we'd be there in 10, 15.

1:17:26.731 --> 1:17:28.534
And there could be a change
in destination.

1:17:28.634 --> 1:17:33.304
Roger that. She got enough fuel
to get you anywhere you want to go.

1:17:56.883 --> 1:17:58.717
Hello?

1:18:08.616 --> 1:18:10.857
Anybody here?

1:18:31.708 --> 1:18:33.643
Put it down.

1:18:43.655 --> 1:18:45.692
You hungry?

1:18:46.524 --> 1:18:48.393
Eat rock salt, motherfucker.

1:18:54.902 --> 1:18:57.307
<i>Marconi, please respond.</i>

1:18:58.437 --> 1:19:01.914
This is a fuckin' shit storm. I'm done.
All right? I gotta get out of here.

1:19:02.014 --> 1:19:04.545
I'm sorry, Mr. Pope,
but if we'd done this sh...

1:19:05.064 --> 1:19:07.113
<i>Anyone seen Marconi?</i>

1:19:22.288 --> 1:19:23.902
Welcome back, Vaughn.

1:19:24.502 --> 1:19:26.722
I'd make this painless
for old time's sake.

1:19:26.822 --> 1:19:30.843
Bullet-in-the-head kind of deal,
but we had a lot of cleaning to do.

1:19:30.943 --> 1:19:33.221
What time is it?

1:19:34.975 --> 1:19:37.012
7:15.

1:19:38.183 --> 1:19:39.818
What are you laughing at?

1:19:39.918 --> 1:19:44.285
You remember that card trick you used
to do all the time when I was a kid?

1:19:44.385 --> 1:19:47.590
The one I could never figure out
'cause I was so busy watching the hand

1:19:47.690 --> 1:19:51.598
that was holding the deck when the magic
was really happening in the other hand?

1:19:51.698 --> 1:19:53.300
What the fuck you talking about?

1:19:53.400 --> 1:19:56.044
I needed to get the money
to the hospital by 7:00.

1:19:56.144 --> 1:19:59.107
That was the deadline.
Pay everything off by 7:00,

1:20:00.208 --> 1:20:03.646
<i>Riley continues her treatments,
she gets her surgery.</i>

1:20:04.446 --> 1:20:07.550
So why are you smiling? You missed it.

1:20:09.150 --> 1:20:11.402
Are you sure about that?

1:20:11.502 --> 1:20:15.456
Or you been too busy watching
the hand holding the deck?

1:20:21.998 --> 1:20:23.764
Check the bag.

1:20:27.670 --> 1:20:29.577
Where's the money?

1:20:29.677 --> 1:20:32.744
You forgot your own trick, Mr. Pope.

1:20:32.844 --> 1:20:36.539
You were watching the wrong hand.
You forgot the magic.

1:20:37.268 --> 1:20:39.153
Morning.

1:20:41.357 --> 1:20:43.886
- Open the door!
- There is no "we."

1:20:43.986 --> 1:20:48.028
We pull this off and get out
of the Swan alive, I'm on my own.

1:20:48.228 --> 1:20:52.664
That pregnant chick, she goes into labor?
They storm the bus. Hostages be damned.

1:20:57.571 --> 1:20:58.606
That was great, sis.

1:20:58.706 --> 1:21:00.809
I still don't understand
why I have to be pregnant.

1:21:00.909 --> 1:21:03.151
Come on, who's going to suspect
a pregnant woman?

1:21:03.251 --> 1:21:05.380
Where's the money?

1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:10.551
Is this going to take much longer?
There's just somewhere I really need to be.

1:21:11.015 --> 1:21:13.620
Yeah, I'm her aunt, father's side.

1:21:15.690 --> 1:21:18.261
Your money's going to save
a little girl's life.

1:21:19.960 --> 1:21:24.001
- What about your life?
- That was a trade I was willing to make.

1:21:24.501 --> 1:21:29.140
You're a fucking hero. Saves your little
girl's life by sacrificing your own.

1:21:29.440 --> 1:21:32.343
I'm touched. You see, you see...

1:21:33.644 --> 1:21:35.613
that's $3 million.

1:21:36.013 --> 1:21:37.656
So you know what I'm going to do?

1:21:37.756 --> 1:21:41.669
First, I'm going to light a match
and I'm going to watch you burn.

1:21:41.769 --> 1:21:43.755
Then I'm going down
to the hospital personally

1:21:43.855 --> 1:21:46.341
and I'm gonna see your little girl.
And guess what?

1:21:46.441 --> 1:21:50.161
I want you to think about
her suffering. Suffering...

1:21:50.261 --> 1:21:53.663
- You're not going to touch my girl.
- I'm gonna touch her. You better believe it.

1:21:54.399 --> 1:21:58.703
What are you doing? What are you doing?
What are you trying to tell me? Yeah.

1:21:59.838 --> 1:22:01.875
See how it's not funny, bitch?

1:22:02.015 --> 1:22:05.112
Stealing $3 million is not
so fucking funny now, is it?

1:22:05.212 --> 1:22:07.511
Rule number 1 is
you never steal from us!

1:22:07.611 --> 1:22:10.451
If you do, we'll make
an example out of a thief!

1:22:10.551 --> 1:22:14.539
Make sure you really know
that you can't steal from us or me!

1:22:14.639 --> 1:22:16.852
I'm gonna fuckin' light your ass up.

1:22:20.994 --> 1:22:25.768
Fuck all. Time to light you the fuck up!

1:22:25.868 --> 1:22:29.642
This ain't on my family.
This ain't on me. Don't touch my girl!

1:22:48.991 --> 1:22:51.292
What a fuckin' day.

1:23:37.218 --> 1:23:39.520
You gonna be okay?

1:23:42.859 --> 1:23:46.298
You know, my mother, she was a nurse.

1:23:47.266 --> 1:23:48.833
Good woman. Strong.

1:23:49.586 --> 1:23:52.242
She used to say when people were...

1:23:52.342 --> 1:23:56.308
dying, on their last breaths...
deathbed shit...

1:23:56.408 --> 1:23:59.881
they'd open up with regrets,
things they wished they'd done different,

1:23:59.981 --> 1:24:02.950
stuff they were desperate to put right.

1:24:03.050 --> 1:24:05.577
So she had this saying.

1:24:06.487 --> 1:24:09.323
"Regrets in death
meant you'd lived life wrong.

1:24:09.423 --> 1:24:11.970
"Don't live life wrong, Frank."

1:24:14.293 --> 1:24:16.030
Dogs me to a tee,

1:24:16.130 --> 1:24:19.035
would have made
the same mistakes I made.

1:24:20.585 --> 1:24:24.748
I can't fix what I did,
but I can stop it from happening again.

1:24:33.297 --> 1:24:35.466
I should go see my daughter.

1:24:47.497 --> 1:24:49.966
You're a good dad, Vaughn.

1:24:53.938 --> 1:24:55.472
Thanks.

1:25:06.117 --> 1:25:07.144
Yeah.

1:25:07.244 --> 1:25:09.307
I didn't expect you to answer.
I thought you might be...

1:25:09.407 --> 1:25:11.224
Dead?

1:25:11.624 --> 1:25:13.255
Yeah, me too.

1:25:13.355 --> 1:25:17.731
<i>Strange? You gonna arrest me,
Officer Bauhaus?</i>

1:25:18.031 --> 1:25:21.902
Well, the weird thing is, I could've sworn
there were three hijackers.

1:25:22.002 --> 1:25:24.238
<i>But everybody on the bus
said there were only two.</i>

1:25:24.338 --> 1:25:26.574
Well, that is strange.

1:25:27.941 --> 1:25:29.775
They're prepping Riley now.

1:25:33.019 --> 1:25:34.747
<i>Vaughn.</i>

1:25:37.083 --> 1:25:38.723
Best news I've had all day.

1:25:39.073 --> 1:25:41.864
What do you want me
to tell her when she wakes?

1:25:42.962 --> 1:25:45.779
You tell her Daddy's coming home.
