That place?

09:32.528 --> 09:34.791

or something.

-[door closes]
-[man chuckles]

20:06.248 --> 20:07.728
Hi, can I help you?

20:07.771 --> 20:09.643
Hi.

20:09.686 --> 20:12.385
Uh, yeah.
I-I'd like to see Donna.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.864
Oh, Donna.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.866
Um... do you have
an appointment?

20:15.910 --> 20:17.216
No.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.739
I-I'm sorry,

20:18.782 --> 20:21.350
we don't do, uh, walk-ins
after 6:00 p.m., so...

20:21.394 --> 20:24.266
Oh, well, I'm a,
I'm a friend of Wyatt's.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.747
-Um, he-he recommended
that I come.
-Wyatt?

20:26.790 --> 20:27.965
Yeah. Wyatt Plimpton.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.141
I just saw him out front.
Such a funny guy.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.796
-I love that guy.
We go, we go way back.
-Uh-huh.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.059
He'd just be really devastated
if he found out

20:35.103 --> 20:37.453
I couldn't get an appointment
with Donna, you know.

20:37.497 --> 20:40.500
Yeah. Um, sure. Yeah.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.153
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Come on in.

20:42.197 --> 20:43.938
Okay, great.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.548
-Yeah.
-Thank you, though.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.942
Whole bunch, yeah.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.030
Oh, thank you.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.076
Thanks. Oh, wow.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.036
It's so much bigger than
I thought it was gonna be.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.212
Uh, thank you so much
for fitting me in.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.953
I, I know you're super busy.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.128
You-- oh, my God!

21:00.171 --> 21:03.000
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

21:03.044 --> 21:05.873
Yeah. No, I'm just, uh, sorry.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.788
Who are you?

21:07.831 --> 21:10.225
I'm Donna, silly.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.010
-[Donna laughs]
-Of course.

21:13.054 --> 21:15.796
-[stammers] Your shirt is off.
-Mm-hmm.

21:15.839 --> 21:17.537
That's kind of what
we're all about here.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.842
Oh, right. Of course. Yeah.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.757
No, you just caught me
off guard.

21:20.801 --> 21:23.238
That's okay.
Why don't we just take this

21:23.282 --> 21:24.544
stuffy little turtleneck

21:24.587 --> 21:26.110
-off of you? No?
-Oh, no, no, no.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.025
[laughing nervously]:
I'm okay. No, no, no. No.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.810
I'm okay.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.333
So what are you doing
here, then?

21:31.377 --> 21:34.467
I'm-I'm just looking
for something relaxing

21:34.510 --> 21:37.948
and, um, and gentle and...

21:37.992 --> 21:40.908
-non-invasive.
-Okay. Don't worry, baby.

21:40.951 --> 21:43.345
Just... Okay, sit down.
Sit down.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.346
Here? Okay.

21:44.390 --> 21:47.871
I know just the thing.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.657
-Oh. Okay. All right.
-Yeah? All right.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.746
-Awesome.
-Take these off.

21:52.789 --> 21:54.443
That's coming off?
Thank you so much.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.750
[both laugh]

21:56.793 --> 21:58.404
Okay. Yay.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.362
-Yeah.
-Pulling off my sock?

22:00.406 --> 22:01.494
[chuckling]

22:02.538 --> 22:03.583
Okay.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.022
-Yes?
-Okay, relax.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.067
Close your eyes.

22:10.111 --> 22:13.375
[Donna chuckles]

22:13.419 --> 22:17.074
Oh, God! Oh, my God,
that-that's, that's really nice.

22:17.118 --> 22:19.990
That's quite far
into your mouth, isn't it?

22:20.034 --> 22:20.991
Ah...

22:21.035 --> 22:22.558
[gasps, stammers]

22:22.602 --> 22:27.258
Uh, so, Donna,
Wyatt comes here a lot, huh?

22:27.302 --> 22:28.912
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah?

22:28.956 --> 22:30.566
[laughing]:
And...

22:30.610 --> 22:33.526
yeah, so you must, you must
know him pretty well now.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.136
Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:35.179 --> 22:36.442
Um...

22:36.485 --> 22:38.182
[whispers]:
Did you shower today?

22:38.226 --> 22:40.315
[whispers]:
I mean, early this morning.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.187
Okay, yeah. Um, why don't--

22:43.231 --> 22:46.103
why don't we just
move up here, you know?

22:46.147 --> 22:48.715
Uh... you know, actually,

22:48.758 --> 22:50.673
could-could-could
you do this foot?

22:50.717 --> 22:53.197
Yeah.
[clears throat]

22:53.241 --> 22:56.679
[moaning]

22:56.723 --> 22:57.811
[mutters]:
That's my favorite.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.116
[both laugh]

22:59.160 --> 23:01.597
So tell me, did you ever meet

23:01.641 --> 23:03.991
Wyatt's brother Wallace at all?

23:05.558 --> 23:06.820
Did you?

23:06.863 --> 23:08.430
I mean, no, not-not really.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.563
I only heard really good things.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.173
I-I just wish I'd had the chance

23:12.216 --> 23:14.828
to, you know,
get to know him better.

23:14.871 --> 23:18.353
Mm-hmm, yeah.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.833
[muffled cry]
Yeah.

23:19.876 --> 23:22.357
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.055
Just, um, lay back, yeah.

23:25.099 --> 23:28.015
Tonight's all about you, so...

23:28.058 --> 23:31.148
Mmm, mmm.

23:31.192 --> 23:34.108
I mean, I did see a photo
of him at Wyatt's place.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.676
God, he was, he was...
he was really hot.

23:36.719 --> 23:39.156
[sobbing]:
Yeah.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.158
Oh, hey, hey. Shh.

23:41.202 --> 23:44.031
-[Donna crying]
-Are you okay?

23:44.074 --> 23:47.861
Oh... Oh, Donna. Shh.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.558
It's okay. It's okay.

23:49.602 --> 23:51.473
I loved him.

23:51.517 --> 23:52.822
Wait. Who? Wallace?

23:52.866 --> 23:55.346
Yeah, and he loved me.

23:55.390 --> 23:58.785
He told me so all the time.

23:58.828 --> 24:01.440
He said he was gonna
leave his wife.

24:01.483 --> 24:04.007
Oh, God, no. I'm sorry.

24:04.051 --> 24:07.402
You know, it wasn't just
about sex with Wally.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.838
You know, we talked a lot.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.492
Once for a whole hour.

24:10.536 --> 24:11.928
Have you ever done that?
Talked for an hour?

24:11.972 --> 24:14.365
Not through texts
or snaps or anything.

24:14.409 --> 24:18.457
Yeah, you guys must have had a
really special connection, huh?

24:18.500 --> 24:20.023
-We did.
-Yeah.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.808
You know, the last time
I saw him,

24:21.851 --> 24:24.767
he asked me to do
backing vocals

24:24.811 --> 24:29.990
on his EP, because he wanted
the world to hear me sing.

24:30.033 --> 24:33.341
And then bam!
She killed him.

24:33.384 --> 24:36.605
And there's been no one
to talk to about it.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.651
I mean, what am I gonna say
to my boyfriend?

24:38.694 --> 24:40.304
"Hey, do you remember
that client of mine

24:40.348 --> 24:42.176
"that I used to fuck
all the time?

24:42.219 --> 24:45.788
Well, I loved him,
and now he's dead."

24:45.832 --> 24:48.617
No, no, of course
you can't say that.

24:48.661 --> 24:50.924
But you can talk to me.

24:50.967 --> 24:54.710
No texts or snaps or...
J-Just the real thing.

24:56.930 --> 25:00.542
What about, what about Wyatt?
C-Can you talk to him?

25:00.586 --> 25:02.936
Um...

25:02.979 --> 25:05.591
he doesn't like it
when I talk about Wally.

25:05.634 --> 25:08.463
Oh, he's jealous.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.943
Yeah.

25:09.986 --> 25:11.727
[Donna sighs]

25:11.771 --> 25:13.468
Hey, Donna,

25:13.512 --> 25:16.558
how long can Wyatt go for?

25:16.602 --> 25:19.474
Like, t-two hours?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.563
Two hours?

25:21.607 --> 25:23.478
[laughs loudly]

25:23.522 --> 25:25.349
[snorts]

25:25.393 --> 25:28.265
Oh, you're so sweet,
trying to cheer me up.

25:28.309 --> 25:31.399
Oh, two hours?
Oh, thank you.

25:31.442 --> 25:34.358
No, no, no, no. Thank you.
Thank you.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.973
You want me to lick
your nipples?

25:41.757 --> 25:44.630
Uh, no, no.

25:44.673 --> 25:47.850
But next time for sure.

25:47.894 --> 25:48.851
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.287
-Okay.
-Okay.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.551
[entry bell jingles]

25:55.684 --> 25:57.773
MARCO [over voice mail]:
Hey, hon, it's me.

25:57.817 --> 26:00.863
I'm still at work,
but I've been thinking

26:00.907 --> 26:03.039
about our conversation,

26:03.083 --> 26:05.738
and I know if we do this,
try for a baby,

26:05.781 --> 26:06.913
it won't be easy.

26:06.956 --> 26:09.611
But tonight a great snowy owl

26:09.655 --> 26:10.699
flew over my head

26:10.743 --> 26:13.049
and stopped on a spruce branch.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.443
And then that owl and I
stared at each other

26:15.486 --> 26:17.271
-for ten minutes.
-Great.

26:17.314 --> 26:20.013
And I remembered this story.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.492
See, there's this couple
I know,

26:21.536 --> 26:23.451
and all they wanted was
a family.

26:23.494 --> 26:26.367
But every doctor they saw
told them it was impossible.

26:26.410 --> 26:29.326
And so they adopted
a beautiful baby girl,

26:29.370 --> 26:31.981
and life was sweet and happy.

26:32.025 --> 26:33.940
And then, two years later,

26:33.983 --> 26:36.986
once they'd stopped trying,
once they'd stop believing,

26:37.030 --> 26:40.860
they got pregnant
with a miracle baby.

26:40.903 --> 26:43.993
-And that miracle baby...
-And that miracle baby...

26:44.037 --> 26:46.561
-was me.
-was me.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.912
All that to say I, I-I just
don't think we should give up.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.653
Oh, come on.

26:51.697 --> 26:55.135
God is out there, and when
she closes a door,

26:55.178 --> 26:58.878
she opens a window.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.488
Oh, God!

27:00.531 --> 27:01.924
Oh, shit.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.057
Miracles can happen.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.712
Man, thinking about
making a baby with you

27:06.755 --> 27:10.237
is giving me a raging hardon.

27:10.280 --> 27:13.588
So you put on those sexy boots
I like, you hot pagan slut.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.242
-Daddy'll be home soon...
-[turns off]

27:15.285 --> 27:16.852
Fucking hell.

27:29.952 --> 27:32.694
[sniffs, clears throat]

27:32.738 --> 27:34.783
[grunting]
