WEBVTT

02:02.023 --> 02:03.591
Oh... sorry...

02:04.626 --> 02:05.593
<i>Pardon</i>

02:08.529 --> 02:10.464
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- <i>Bonjour</i>

02:10.665 --> 02:12.800
- Maggie?
- Bernard?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.571
<i>Je m'excuse...</i>

02:16.771 --> 02:19.306
Are you... all right?

02:20.474 --> 02:24.545
Yes. Just give me a second.

02:42.462 --> 02:43.765
Is it my fault?

02:44.364 --> 02:45.465
I'm sorry?

02:45.667 --> 02:46.701
I missed you...

02:48.368 --> 02:50.370
The other entrance.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.841
The other entrance? Oh, of
course.

02:54.042 --> 02:56.544
No, no, totally my fault.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.345
Did you get spun around?

02:58.546 --> 03:04.686
I... no, not spun... I found
the place all right.

03:04.886 --> 03:06.654
It was just... a bit of a...

03:06.854 --> 03:08.623
a bit of a communication
problem...

03:08.890 --> 03:11.659
...internally, I mean.

03:13.695 --> 03:15.830
Well, so you're English.

03:16.030 --> 03:19.399
- And so are you!
- And so I am.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.735
They sent me especially.

03:22.103 --> 03:24.605
Might have had something to do
with my schoolboy French,

03:24.806 --> 03:25.973
when I called.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.342
So will it just be the two of
us?

03:29.544 --> 03:33.447
We do have a team. I'm a bit
junior.

03:33.715 --> 03:36.551
- Just the guy they send out for a first look.
- Right.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.754
So, here we are.

03:40.387 --> 03:44.525
Listen, are you sure it's all right
to take the whole afternoon for this?

03:44.726 --> 03:47.494
Absolutely. It's really the
only way to see it all.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.496
And we're fine to walk, rather
than drive?

03:49.697 --> 03:50.965
I am if you are.

03:51.431 --> 03:52.432
Absolutely.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.770
Brilliant. You can just leave
the car here.

03:56.604 --> 04:01.509
Now, I must warn you, it's
pretty run down.

04:01.843 --> 04:07.247
Well, I guess that makes it
all the more... cinematic.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.488
Sorry.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.459
That might be a problem.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.965
- Sounds like there's an airport nearby?
- Oh. Just a small one, In Rouen.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.668
I'll check the schedules.

04:28.069 --> 04:33.508
Right. So any rivers, streams,
flowing water on the property?

04:33.708 --> 04:36.544
No. But there's a lake, and
two small ponds.

04:37.078 --> 04:40.548
And which way is west?

04:40.748 --> 04:41.783
- Over there.
- Oh.

04:42.517 --> 04:46.687
- So, sunset over there?
- Yup, almost every day.

04:47.855 --> 04:48.956
Yes.

04:50.191 --> 04:54.929
Great. Best during autumn,
so good timing there.

04:55.129 --> 04:59.634
Well, I can definitely see why Monet
painted the cathedral a million times.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.569
Never the same light twice!

05:01.769 --> 05:04.672
That could make things tricky
actually.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.043
I'd love to take a few photos
if...

05:09.243 --> 05:10.310
Please, go ahead.

05:11.846 --> 05:14.949
For some reason my phone doesn't
send pictures over here, so...

05:15.149 --> 05:18.052
Oh, it's just something with the
settings. I had it happen to me. I can...

05:36.871 --> 05:39.006
Right, it works.

05:40.875 --> 05:45.880
- Now please delete that immediately.
- Oh, I don't know!

05:46.948 --> 05:49.083
I think I'll just stick with
this.

05:50.051 --> 05:51.686
Whatever works.

05:55.690 --> 05:57.992
Maybe you could give me the
lowdown?

05:58.192 --> 06:01.996
OK, the basics. Roughly twenty
acres altogether.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.032
Large forest to the south of us,
farmland to the north.

06:05.233 --> 06:10.037
the main building was put up on the
original foundation of a feudal castle,

06:10.238 --> 06:14.041
which had been destroyed during the
Wars of Religion, probably around 1592.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.778
Lots of modifications and
additions since then.

06:18.246 --> 06:20.781
The heritage is the thing,
really.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.383
Best known for one famous
literary guest,

06:23.651 --> 06:25.853
Fontenelle, who wrote his
landmark

06:26.053 --> 06:28.055
"Conversations on the Plurality
of Worlds",

06:28.256 --> 06:30.992
while staying here at
the end of the 17th Century.

06:31.259 --> 06:34.128
Of course Fontenelle isn't
a household name now,

06:34.328 --> 06:36.130
but he's very influential.

06:36.330 --> 06:39.734
He helped popularize the
Copernican model of the universe.

06:40.201 --> 06:43.070
That in fact the sun doesn't
orbit the Earth...

06:43.738 --> 06:45.940
It's the other way round. Yes.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.808
He was probably thinking:

06:49.210 --> 06:51.444
Come on, people... this paradigm
isn't going to shift itself!

06:57.051 --> 06:59.553
Presumably the book was based on
actual events:

07:00.021 --> 07:02.757
A young philosopher... basically
meaning a scientist,

07:02.957 --> 07:03.958
stays at a country château,

07:04.158 --> 07:07.494
hosted by a bright young
aristocratic woman.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.530
Every evening for five nights,

07:09.730 --> 07:12.967
the two of them go for a walk
in gardens just like these

07:13.167 --> 07:16.436
and have very descriptive and
often quite flirty

07:16.637 --> 07:18.940
conversations on how the cosmos
works.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.909
Fascinating.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.080
No, really it is.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.116
Well, it was a radical idea,
and it took a while

07:29.317 --> 07:32.954
to catch on. Because the
pre-Copernican model,

07:33.154 --> 07:35.089
with all these stars
miraculously

07:35.289 --> 07:38.025
flying round the Earth in only a
day's time, and a bunch of

07:38.225 --> 07:40.227
planets that didn't quite move
quite like the rest of them,

07:40.428 --> 07:42.930
and the odd comet coming
inexplicably out of nowhere...

07:43.130 --> 07:46.133
well, it a bit of a mess. Or,
anyway,

07:46.334 --> 07:48.836
the explanation got so
self-contradictory

07:49.036 --> 07:51.138
because people kept adding
unnecessary complications

07:51.339 --> 07:52.907
just to try and rationalize it.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.142
Sounds like a bad
relationship.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.144
Tell me about it.

07:58.713 --> 08:01.048
You don't actually have to tell
me about it. I was just saying...

08:01.248 --> 08:02.850
agreeing with you.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.518
Right.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.088
I'm sorry if I go on too much
about this stuff.

08:07.288 --> 08:09.991
It's just so funny:

08:10.624 --> 08:11.993
I don't think I'd ever even
heard

08:12.193 --> 08:13.928
of Fontenelle before taking this
job,

08:14.128 --> 08:15.162
and getting to know this
property.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.666
But his stuff clicked with
things

08:18.866 --> 08:21.268
I suppose I'd always been
interested in.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.671
Makes you wonder.

08:24.138 --> 08:25.206
Right.

08:27.208 --> 08:31.112
I mean, what if this very
important book

08:31.312 --> 08:34.915
that was written here was really
boring,

08:35.116 --> 08:36.617
of no interest whatsoever?

08:36.817 --> 08:39.053
What if! We'd probably still
think

08:39.253 --> 08:41.088
we were the centre of the
universe.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.980
Last occupied quite a few years
ago by descendants

09:06.180 --> 09:09.583
of the owners from its halcyon days, who
couldn't afford to keep the place up anymore.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.988
Official policy is that I'm not supposed
to admit this, but it's quite a sad story.

09:14.288 --> 09:18.692
Anyway, the plan was to convert
it all into a spa and golf course.

09:19.260 --> 09:22.563
But that would've meant doing away with
some important historical features.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.332
What with property law here being
about as fusty and arcane as the

09:25.534 --> 09:29.236
outdated model of the universe,
well, permission for that was denied.

09:29.437 --> 09:31.238
- Red tape...
- Oh, yes.

09:32.106 --> 09:34.008
So it's been on the market
again,

09:34.208 --> 09:35.643
but really in a sort of limbo.

09:36.110 --> 09:37.378
Maintenance obviously neglected,
apart

09:38.112 --> 09:41.248
from emergency work to stop some
of the buildings collapsing.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.086
Water's running, but the
heating's bust.

09:45.286 --> 09:47.655
A cleaner and a gardener come
every couple of weeks.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.590
Given the planning issues, how
do you think

09:49.790 --> 09:52.693
the locals would react to a film
production happening here?

09:52.893 --> 09:54.161
Just... gut feeling?

09:54.361 --> 09:55.863
It's an unusual situation.

09:56.130 --> 09:59.300
Temporary occupancy. Hard to
tell.

09:59.501 --> 10:00.634
I see.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.837
Not entirely encouraging.

10:03.237 --> 10:05.639
Maybe not entirely, but...

10:06.874 --> 10:09.276
Well, what can you tell me about
your film?

10:11.879 --> 10:13.681
Not much, I'm afraid.

10:14.148 --> 10:16.217
The director is a bit of an
eccentric.

10:16.851 --> 10:18.786
Brilliant. But cryptic.

10:19.854 --> 10:23.290
He said if I find the right
place, he'll fit the story to it.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.160
Calls it "living off the land".

10:26.427 --> 10:28.696
He's a romantic, I suppose.

10:28.896 --> 10:32.766
One thing I can tell you is that in
this case we only need one location.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.169
Or, one that serves as many.

10:35.369 --> 10:36.670
So that's an advantage,

10:37.138 --> 10:39.173
or maybe a disadvantage.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.677
I was instructed to take my time
and

10:43.878 --> 10:47.348
hold out for a cosmic epiphany,
whatever that means.

10:47.781 --> 10:48.349
Wow.

10:49.551 --> 10:52.653
I swear I'm not being coy.
I really don't know.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.724
- It's actually a bit nerve-wracking.
- I can imagine.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.898
Before we go in, can I ask you
something else?

11:04.465 --> 11:05.666
Yeah.

11:06.901 --> 11:09.370
Is it just me or does this
feel really familiar?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.737
<i>Bonjour</i>. Maggie?

12:16.937 --> 12:17.905
Hi.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.374
- It's my fault.
- I'm sorry?

12:20.575 --> 12:22.743
I must have told you to go to
the other entrance.

12:22.943 --> 12:23.511
Ah.

12:24.579 --> 12:25.746
I hope you didn't get too spun
around.

12:25.946 --> 12:26.880
It's all right.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.984
Well, you're English.

12:30.351 --> 12:32.486
- And so are you!
- And so I am.

12:33.454 --> 12:34.855
What are the odds?

12:37.124 --> 12:38.859
So. Here we are.

12:39.661 --> 12:40.961
Will it just be the two of us?

12:42.763 --> 12:46.433
- I hope that's all right.
- Yes. I... only hate to take up your whole afternoon.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.869
It's really the only way to
see it all.

12:49.370 --> 12:51.506
And we're fine to walk, rather
than drive?

12:51.706 --> 12:53.173
I am if you are.

12:53.508 --> 12:54.808
Absolutely.

12:56.443 --> 13:01.015
Great. Well, why don't I just leave
the car here, and, uh, we'll go.

13:03.384 --> 13:06.086
Now, I must warn you, it's
pretty run down.

13:06.287 --> 13:08.523
Excellent. Nothing but
potential.

13:10.592 --> 13:13.193
- Er, Excuse me a sec.
- Of course.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.817
Everything all right?

13:39.621 --> 13:43.957
Ah, I see. Would you say it's
more of an <i>ennui</i> or a <i>malaise</i>?

13:44.559 --> 13:47.227
It's sort of a <i>je ne sais</i>
<i>quoi</i>.

13:47.662 --> 13:50.532
Ah. But not quite a <i>joie de</i>
<i>vivre</i>, in any case.

13:50.732 --> 13:54.268
<i>Non</i>. Not quite. Not yet.

13:57.572 --> 13:59.507
Sounds like there's an airport
nearby?

13:59.708 --> 14:00.575
In Rouen.

14:01.676 --> 14:03.844
Great. That could be really
convenient.

14:05.979 --> 14:11.251
- And mobile phone coverage is strong, I see.
- Not everywhere. There are definitely some dead zones.

14:11.985 --> 14:17.057
We can certainly help with that. In any case
we'd need to dig up quite a bit to lay our cables.

14:17.759 --> 14:20.060
And we'd need to do a lot in
terms of security.

14:20.628 --> 14:22.262
Maybe more than you'd expect.

14:22.463 --> 14:23.297
Oh.

14:25.065 --> 14:29.637
Our CEO is really paranoid. He's had
several threats made against his life.

14:30.672 --> 14:32.906
These two facts may be related.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.978
Would you mind if I take a few
photos?

14:39.046 --> 14:40.047
By all means.

14:40.247 --> 14:44.652
Great. You can give me the
lowdown as we go.

15:05.239 --> 15:09.443
What's fascinating to me is that Fontenelle is
obviously wrong on some pretty basic stuff,

15:09.644 --> 15:13.615
and yet exactly right,
and way ahead of his time, on many others.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.316
Life on the moon? Uh, sorry.

15:16.818 --> 15:19.052
Although even he said:

15:19.286 --> 15:22.156
<i>don't give more than half
your mind to ideas like this,</i>

15:22.356 --> 15:26.193
<i>and leave the other half open so
that contrary ideas can still fit in.</i>

15:28.462 --> 15:34.101
Now everybody knows that the idea of
life on the moon is silly, don't they?

15:34.301 --> 15:40.240
Yet not everybody knows why, when we look at
the moon, we always see the same side of it.

15:41.341 --> 15:45.345
Because it takes as long to go round
its axis as it does around the Earth.

15:45.713 --> 15:48.449
Guess who was already onto that
in 1686?

15:49.249 --> 15:52.052
It's entirely appropriate they
named a crater after him.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.691
Obviously the bigger deal was the bit
about the Earth going round the sun.

15:56.891 --> 15:59.293
That was radical, and took a
while to catch on.

15:59.761 --> 16:03.997
Because the previous understanding
was so self-contradictory

16:04.198 --> 16:07.434
that people kept adding unnecessary
complications to try and rationalize it.

16:07.735 --> 16:11.104
- Sounds like a bad relationship.
- Tell me about it.

16:11.773 --> 16:14.742
You don't have to actually tell
me about it. I was just saying...

16:16.143 --> 16:16.977
Right.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.151
René Descartes figured that all heavenly
bodies swirled around in the ether,

16:24.552 --> 16:27.254
making little whirlpools that
held everything together.

16:27.555 --> 16:30.758
That was his system, which
Fontenelle adopted.

16:32.326 --> 16:37.030
Well, then Isaac Newton amended Descartes,
not long after <i>Conversations</i> was published.

16:37.532 --> 16:42.269
Fontenelle revised it,
but it didn't line up with the new system.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.505
Not that it's about that.

16:45.305 --> 16:50.477
It's about the possibility, the value,
of reasonable, non-pedantic conversation.

16:52.547 --> 16:58.385
OK, well, then Einstein amended
Newton, and so on.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.589
The idea of the ether hasn't
entirely gone away.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.526
Spacetime, dark matter,

17:05.459 --> 17:10.532
we still need there to be "stuff",
some medium which it all swirls around in.

17:11.231 --> 17:15.537
And we still need someone to
remind us, as Fontenelle put it,

17:16.169 --> 17:24.044
that <i>our common folly is to believe that everything
in creation is destined for our service.</i>

17:28.516 --> 17:32.587
Anyway, last occupied quite a
few years ago,

17:32.787 --> 17:37.257
but the owners couldn't afford to keep the place up
any more. And so eventually our firm acquired it.

17:37.592 --> 17:42.229
Official policy is not to admit as
much, but it's quite a sad story.

17:42.597 --> 17:45.198
Or at least I think it is.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.438
Is it just me or does this feel
really familiar?

17:53.908 --> 17:57.177
I don't know. What's your
yardstick?

17:57.477 --> 17:58.680
What's yours?

17:59.714 --> 18:01.415
I'm not sure there is one.

18:01.616 --> 18:05.185
For me, or you, or anyone.

18:06.621 --> 18:08.255
That seems acceptable.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.426
Shall we?

18:27.609 --> 18:29.409
This is a bit unpleasant, but
wasn't

18:29.611 --> 18:32.513
- there something about a... suicide?
- What?

18:32.780 --> 18:36.283
Someone in the bankrupt family,
after losing the property?

18:36.483 --> 18:40.354
Oh, I don't... You know, I'm
just a bit junior myself.

18:40.688 --> 18:42.657
Just the girl they send out to
show the place.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.593
Thought I read a mention in
somebody's notes.

18:45.793 --> 18:51.799
Well, that would be terrible. But not
beyond the realm of possibility, I suppose.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.669
This place has definitely had
its fair share of casualties.

18:54.869 --> 18:58.573
- Maybe more than its fair share.
- Maybe.

19:04.679 --> 19:07.849
So, <i>Pluralities of Worlds</i>, eh?

19:08.348 --> 19:10.283
Doesn't exactly roll off the
tongue.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.522
<i>Conversations on the Plurality</i>
<i>of Worlds</i> It's very important.

19:14.722 --> 19:16.858
Or at least, that's its English
name.

19:17.058 --> 19:20.762
Quite right. Everything important
starts with a conversation.

19:23.631 --> 19:26.333
So this is, or was, the library.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.705
Yes, it's a hugely important book.
And not his only contribution.

19:31.471 --> 19:37.679
In fact, in my early eager-beaver days I lobbied for
having the whole place turned into a Fontenelle museum.

19:38.646 --> 19:40.915
That idea didn't really catch
on.

19:42.950 --> 19:45.318
But maybe there's a buyer out there who'll
recognize the cultural significance of the place.

19:45.853 --> 19:49.557
- And be able to afford it.
- Yeah, that too.

19:49.857 --> 19:53.928
- What do you think the odds are?
- Mm, maybe slightly lower than the odds of

19:54.128 --> 19:57.699
intelligent extra-terrestrials
elsewhere in the universe.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.501
Right. Pity.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.938
Maybe some aliens will come
along and buy it.

20:04.739 --> 20:06.574
Surely they'd know what they've
got here.

20:06.774 --> 20:08.609
They might not even need
central heating.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.578
That's the spirit.

20:12.479 --> 20:15.616
Well, I seem to like the place
after all.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.485
I'll take it!

20:18.720 --> 20:21.622
Wish I could buy it. Maybe.

20:22.924 --> 20:25.860
I think I'm beginning to feel a
little protective over it.

20:26.828 --> 20:27.995
Isn't that funny?

20:29.864 --> 20:32.900
Having managed the place for quite a while
now, I feel pretty attached to it myself.

20:36.771 --> 20:38.506
Could you help me with...?

20:40.041 --> 20:41.509
Yeah!

20:49.884 --> 20:51.686
So do you know any stars?

20:51.919 --> 20:54.655
I can usually find Orion's
belt.

20:55.056 --> 20:56.958
I meant stars as in famous
people.

20:57.792 --> 20:59.660
No, I...

21:00.528 --> 21:05.700
...not really. Unless you count
That Guy from That Thing,

21:05.900 --> 21:10.004
- and What's Her Name Again.
- Oh, you know them?! I love them!

21:10.204 --> 21:14.609
Know is too strong a word.
But we worked together once or twice.

21:14.809 --> 21:16.476
And what are they like in
person?

21:17.645 --> 21:19.279
Just like everybody else.

21:21.883 --> 21:26.687
About four ninety-five.
How exact do you need it?

21:26.888 --> 21:29.023
That'll do. Thanks. This
way...

21:33.795 --> 21:36.898
Did you ever want to be in films
yourself? Or make them?

21:37.098 --> 21:42.335
No, no. I wouldn't know how.
Don't have the mind for it.

21:43.037 --> 21:44.939
I'm not sure what I do have the
mind for.

21:45.706 --> 21:46.941
Started law school,

21:47.141 --> 21:49.577
but that felt wrong pretty
quickly.

21:49.777 --> 21:53.848
Somehow fell into this film location racket
thinking it would be a good way to travel.

21:54.048 --> 21:55.850
Ah, brilliant.

21:57.819 --> 22:02.590
It is and it isn't. You can never just be
in a place; you always have to pay attention.

22:03.591 --> 22:06.093
Although maybe that's precisely
what my mind is good for:

22:06.661 --> 22:08.996
- the refusal to relax.
- Oh, I don't know.

22:09.697 --> 22:13.000
I think maybe you've got something in
your idea of alien property developers.

22:16.204 --> 22:20.340
Would you believe one of the
deal-breakers with my ex was an argument

22:20.541 --> 22:23.678
about the Fermi paradox?
Do you know what that is?

22:24.779 --> 22:26.881
I've worked on a couple of
sci-fi shows.

22:27.849 --> 22:30.383
- That's something to do with aliens too, right?
- Yeah!

22:32.053 --> 22:34.889
That's all I've got. You'll
have to remind me.

22:35.189 --> 22:40.628
Basically, that yes, indeed, the likelihood of
there being civilized life somewhere else out there

22:40.828 --> 22:45.132
is so high, it's seriously weird not
to have had contact with any by now.

22:46.234 --> 22:48.970
Maybe they're all too busy
scrolling on their space phones

22:49.170 --> 22:51.772
to engage in meaningful personal
communication.

22:51.973 --> 22:54.876
You know, that is one theory,
more or less.

22:55.076 --> 22:59.013
Yeah, we should send them
a big group text, distract them

22:59.213 --> 23:02.382
from what they're doing and make
them feel pressured to reply...

23:02.583 --> 23:06.954
Or, you know, maybe they're just
really bad at reading social cues.

23:07.221 --> 23:09.724
Our whole civilization is like
that now.

23:10.124 --> 23:13.794
Do you think that's a consequence
of technological evolution?

23:14.128 --> 23:19.767
Just as you master spaceflight, you also
become vaguely sociopathic. I like it.

23:20.134 --> 23:24.538
I mean, it's sad and tragic, but
that's precisely its charm.

23:24.939 --> 23:28.943
You see! How hard is it to stretch your brain
once in a while and just, you know, give a toss.

23:29.277 --> 23:32.914
- Oh, I didn't mean to...
- Oh, not you. One.

23:33.247 --> 23:35.750
Well, one in particular.

23:37.919 --> 23:39.887
You know he didn't even really care about the question
of whether we're alone in the universe or not!

23:40.087 --> 23:42.823
How can you not care about that?
Just a little?

23:44.225 --> 23:47.528
And I always felt like I was the only one
who cared about the state of our flat.

23:48.296 --> 23:53.768
I was the one opening curtains, and buying flowers and
turning music on. Otherwise it just wouldn't happen.

23:54.902 --> 23:58.973
So, yeah... that.
And the Fermi paradox.

24:01.976 --> 24:05.012
It's funny how you think you
know what you need from someone,

24:05.212 --> 24:08.082
and then some little thing gives
you a whole new perspective on that.

24:09.951 --> 24:12.219
Or I guess it's not a little
thing. It's a huge thing.

24:12.987 --> 24:14.121
That's the point.

24:16.257 --> 24:18.993
Maybe your director could make a
movie about that.

24:19.927 --> 24:23.030
- Your love life?
- Oh God, no. Boring!

24:23.597 --> 24:26.133
The Plurality. Fontenelle.

24:28.069 --> 24:31.572
Fontenelle. Sounds like a
pudding.

24:32.273 --> 24:34.608
Something with lots of pastry
and cream.

24:34.842 --> 24:37.144
And chocolate! There'd have to
be chocolate.

24:38.012 --> 24:39.479
It should be if it isn't
already.

24:41.182 --> 24:44.051
Fontenelle made it more possible
for women to be scientists.

24:44.251 --> 24:48.923
And for science-fiction, like that show you
worked on, even to be a genre in the first place.

24:49.390 --> 24:54.662
So, yeah, I am pro-Fontenelle.
<i>Quel mec</i>!

25:02.169 --> 25:07.274
So, it's basically all dialogue,
with only two people, right?

25:07.475 --> 25:09.176
Yeah, pretty much.

25:10.845 --> 25:14.682
- Hm, I don't know.
- And not even really a drama, it's more of an essay.

25:15.916 --> 25:21.255
- Not exactly high-stakes conflict.
- No. Although I suppose that is relative.

25:21.455 --> 25:24.525
They talk about things that were
very dangerous ideas back then.

25:25.393 --> 25:32.533
Actually, do you know what it's really like? It's like
one of those super nerdy late-night student chats.

25:33.267 --> 25:37.938
- God, do you remember those?
- I do, yeah. Barely.

25:38.406 --> 25:42.043
- It feels like it's been forever.
- Doesn't it? I miss that.

25:43.411 --> 25:46.747
Yeah, it's like that. With an
element of romance, though.

25:46.981 --> 25:52.686
They definitely flirt. Each of them has a
kind of naivety, each has a kind of wisdom.

25:52.887 --> 25:56.257
They need each other. I swear there's
something going on between them.

25:58.225 --> 26:01.228
OK, so obviously not something
my ex would buy a ticket for.

26:01.429 --> 26:06.200
Although maybe he'd watch it on Netflix for a
nostalgic night of feeling bored and annoyed at me.

26:06.834 --> 26:09.270
- I'll be sure to tell the boss.
- Please do.

26:10.337 --> 26:16.143
- You must promise not to be hurt if he goes in a different direction.
- Offence will not be taken.

26:17.745 --> 26:21.749
So, shall we go and have a look at
the <i>petit château</i>... the little house?

26:22.116 --> 26:25.352
I thought this was the <i>petit</i>
one. Now I am in a spin.

26:26.487 --> 26:28.155
- I'm just joking.
- Oh.

26:30.124 --> 26:33.928
I'm sure it does feel little when you're
standing in the living room of that one

26:33.994 --> 26:36.330
looking through the
window back at this one.

26:36.397 --> 26:39.600
Yes, let's go look at the little
house.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.268
The relatively little house.

26:52.746 --> 26:54.281
Should you get that?

26:56.750 --> 26:58.652
Why don't I just turn it off?

26:59.487 --> 27:00.888
Are you sure?

27:06.528 --> 27:08.762
...last occupied quite a few
years ago,

27:10.931 --> 27:12.733
but the owners couldn't afford to keep the place up
any more. And so eventually our firm acquired it.

27:14.335 --> 27:18.372
Official policy is not to admit as
much, but it's quite a sad story.

27:18.906 --> 27:20.307
Or at least I think it is.

27:22.877 --> 27:25.412
The plan was to convert it all
into a spa and golf course.

27:25.614 --> 27:31.752
But, property law here being about as arcane and
fusty as the outdated model of the universe,

27:31.952 --> 27:33.787
well, permission for that was
denied.

27:34.488 --> 27:36.690
- Good old red tape.
- Oh, yes.

27:37.791 --> 27:41.195
That's fine. Wouldn't want it
any other way.

27:55.943 --> 27:59.246
And so you're... what are you?

28:02.816 --> 28:05.986
My email signature says
Director of Special Projects.

28:06.487 --> 28:12.960
And at the moment, my special project is finding
just the right spot for a satellite campus.

28:14.228 --> 28:15.696
Hence our afternoon together.

28:16.931 --> 28:17.965
It feels nice to be a part of
something special.

28:19.568 --> 28:22.903
I'm flattered by your interest.
On behalf of my employer, of course.

28:23.605 --> 28:27.441
I'm flattered by your being
flattered, on behalf of mine.

28:28.943 --> 28:33.347
So can I ask, why here?
Why not something in a city?

28:34.516 --> 28:41.455
Well, we've developed plenty of somethings in plenty of
cities but we've been routinely accused of gentrification,

28:41.922 --> 28:43.257
or worse.

28:45.726 --> 28:52.499
So we had a brainstorm, and decided to establish something
somewhere with a pre-existing aristocratic infrastructure,

28:53.434 --> 28:55.503
- whatever that means.
- I see.

28:57.639 --> 29:00.741
Well, the local <i>départment</i> will still
find a way to make things hard for you.

29:00.941 --> 29:04.878
- You mustn't underestimate that.
- Of course. We've budgeted for it.

29:05.312 --> 29:08.382
As I said, we wouldn't have it
any other way.

29:08.650 --> 29:14.321
It can't just be about infrastructure, though,
right? Don't you just get a gut feeling sometimes?

29:16.423 --> 29:17.992
Sometimes.

29:19.793 --> 29:22.463
But you probably have an algorithm to
determine the sentimental value of things.

29:23.163 --> 29:25.766
We have plenty of algorithms.

29:26.501 --> 29:28.969
But sometimes their logic can be
a bit fuzzy.

29:36.578 --> 29:39.847
- About the last family that lived here...
- Yeah?

29:41.448 --> 29:42.182
Oh, nothing.

30:00.034 --> 30:01.869
And here's the library.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.572
It's really a shame to see it in
this condition.

30:07.975 --> 30:11.078
Have you ever had a fear of re-reading
books that once meant the world to you?

30:12.446 --> 30:18.952
What would that be called?
Retro-biblio-philia-phobia?

30:19.486 --> 30:22.222
I'm sure a poet somewhere has
come up with a name for it.

30:23.457 --> 30:25.125
I get that fear sometimes.

30:27.261 --> 30:30.998
Like how you can fall in love with someone and be
dazzled by all the beautiful things about them,

30:31.633 --> 30:35.102
and then one day suddenly realize you've
considered them ugly for a long time.

30:36.170 --> 30:38.839
- I don't read many books these days.
- No?

30:39.641 --> 30:43.243
Not for a while. Not since my
abortive attempt at law school.

30:44.746 --> 30:47.247
- In my case it was when someone
said: <i>the universe</i>

30:47.448 --> 30:49.983
<i>doesn't care about me, so why
should I care about it?</i>

30:50.184 --> 30:52.986
- Me as in you?
- No, him. I'm quoting him.

30:53.187 --> 30:56.990
As in, the universe didn't care about
him, so why should he care about it?

30:58.058 --> 31:01.295
But it's a good guess that his
logic applied to me too.

31:01.663 --> 31:03.931
It is a fairly perceptive
question.

31:04.264 --> 31:07.000
I know. I loved him a lot.

31:10.137 --> 31:12.306
It's funny how you think you
know what you need.

31:13.140 --> 31:14.809
You want someone to make you
feel like you're not alone.

31:15.577 --> 31:20.147
So maybe it's worse when you do find
someone and you end up feeling more alone.

31:22.617 --> 31:27.254
I ended up marrying someone
blonde and sunny, which is strange,

31:28.088 --> 31:32.594
because I'd always thought I had a thing
for pensive, unconventional brunettes.

31:34.729 --> 31:36.930
She even agreed with me.

31:40.267 --> 31:44.037
So what do we know about this
woman?

31:44.773 --> 31:45.439
Sorry?

31:47.709 --> 31:52.446
The marquise. This scientist came to her château,
presumably with several other high society guests,

31:52.647 --> 31:59.319
and what... the two of them just slipped out and
went for country walks in the garden every night?

31:59.521 --> 32:00.655
That's just the book.

32:02.524 --> 32:04.958
Yeah, but he was based on the author,
and she was based on a real person, right?

32:05.159 --> 32:08.128
She was the daughter of a very
distinguished salon hostess.

32:08.328 --> 32:11.432
When he wrote it she was a widow
in her 20s, with a little boy.

32:12.734 --> 32:14.401
I don't know how her husband
died.

32:16.336 --> 32:19.106
- You've really got into this, haven't you?
- For some reason I just couldn't help myself.

32:20.274 --> 32:22.309
There is something about this
place. Isn't there?

32:23.076 --> 32:25.112
We shall consult the
algorithm.

32:28.081 --> 32:34.188
Come on, what is it, you like to just come
up here every now and then and... hang out?

32:34.388 --> 32:38.158
You make it sound unseemly.
It's not like I'm squatting or anything.

32:39.426 --> 32:43.330
Well wouldn't you, if you had
access to a place like this?

32:44.364 --> 32:47.234
It does feel miles away from
everything.

32:47.434 --> 32:50.505
Mm. It does. Nice, isn't it?

32:51.739 --> 32:52.439
I don't know.

32:56.243 --> 33:01.549
I suppose I can understand how some people might
resist the idea of a tech company taking over.

33:02.416 --> 33:05.520
Even an empty country retreat is
still a country retreat.

33:07.387 --> 33:11.425
Maybe it's the emptiness itself
that's most appealing.

33:12.326 --> 33:15.195
What is it that makes someone
cross that threshold?

33:15.395 --> 33:18.265
One minute you're texting right in front
of your friends to see if there's something

33:18.332 --> 33:21.368
better going on somewhere
else without you,

33:21.435 --> 33:28.075
and the next you're swearing off the Internet, maybe
even off the grid entirely, hiding in your bunker.

33:29.209 --> 33:32.514
We have teams working on that
very question.

33:32.814 --> 33:34.281
Teams!

33:48.863 --> 33:54.334
Oh, and yet, lest we forget, this is pretty much the
same basic stuff that got Galileo banned and arrested.

33:54.536 --> 33:57.572
It's one of the ideas that got
Giordano Bruno burned at the stake.

33:57.872 --> 34:00.107
- Is that so?
- It is.

34:00.542 --> 34:03.210
How do you think our man
Fontenelle got away with it?

34:04.344 --> 34:09.182
Probably helped not to be in Italy. And to
be friends with the local chief of police.

34:10.350 --> 34:13.353
But also: his book isn't
polemical.

34:13.555 --> 34:18.358
It's very charming. And that
always goes such a long way.

34:19.326 --> 34:23.330
- Oh, god. I'm just going on and on, aren't I?
- No, no, please continue.

34:23.531 --> 34:24.532
OK, good!

34:25.733 --> 34:28.168
It's good to have a real
audience.

34:28.368 --> 34:31.238
You know, I started a Facebook
group, but nobody joined.

34:31.606 --> 34:33.440
- Ah.
- Yeah.

34:35.877 --> 34:39.379
- Well, there are loads of other ways you could try...
- Actually, no. It's weird to hear myself talk about it.

34:39.747 --> 34:42.215
I'm almost afraid to share it
now.

34:51.258 --> 34:56.363
Plurality of worlds. I think the
most recent, very educated guess

34:56.564 --> 35:02.202
is that there's something like 40 billion Earth-like
planets, of the right temperature, in the Milky Way alone.

35:02.537 --> 35:07.207
Universe. Multiverse.
At a certain point it stops mattering.

35:07.642 --> 35:11.178
- I suppose that's the definition of infinity.
- That's a bit cynical.

35:11.679 --> 35:15.182
You could say that. Or just
practical.

35:15.650 --> 35:21.254
Some people find the concept of infinity
soothing. Others find it terrifying.

35:21.789 --> 35:27.528
Why not just compromise and say: it is
what it is. It's a big old twisted loop.

35:27.729 --> 35:31.331
Definitely cynical. But I
don't blame you.

35:31.532 --> 35:35.570
It's the age we live in. They thought the atom
bomb would burn off the whole atmosphere.

35:35.770 --> 35:40.474
They thought the Large Hadron Collider would tear
open a black hole which would swallow us all.

35:41.274 --> 35:44.311
No, it won't be so quick and
easy.

35:44.512 --> 35:48.281
It'll be overpopulation, climate
change,

35:48.482 --> 35:54.287
some marauding investment bank that becomes
sentient, all gradually wearing us down.

35:55.056 --> 35:58.693
From the plurality to the singularity!
Before we even know it.

36:00.360 --> 36:07.434
OK, but what if all civilizations have decided
it's too dangerous to make contact...

36:07.635 --> 36:10.437
they've all sort of made it a
policy not to.

36:11.304 --> 36:16.678
Some people just stare at their phones all the time
because they're too shy and awkward, it's easier.

36:18.913 --> 36:23.751
You know, I think this place
is bigger than I'd...

36:24.686 --> 36:27.889
What about these buildings, out
here, do people live in those?

36:28.321 --> 36:30.357
They've been empty for several
years.

36:30.558 --> 36:35.495
- I see. But it's possible.
- Sure. You might be able to convert them.

36:36.864 --> 36:38.566
Then I do see potential here.

36:41.035 --> 36:45.740
Tell me this, Mr. Special Projects, if this does become
your satellite campus, would you be working here yourself?

36:47.407 --> 36:48.910
In a way I already am.

36:51.679 --> 36:55.616
- This one. The little one.
- Relatively little.

36:55.950 --> 36:57.451
Can we take a look?

37:36.624 --> 37:37.625
After you.

37:38.960 --> 37:42.597
- Shouldn't it be ladies first?
- Not in this situation.

37:42.797 --> 37:46.033
This is uncharted territory.
I'm not even sure if it's safe.

37:49.570 --> 37:54.942
How about this? If it isn't
safe, we can turn around.

37:55.943 --> 37:59.814
- And around...
- And around...

38:00.882 --> 38:03.684
- There must be a way to the main
rooms from here.

38:04.519 --> 38:06.587
Shouldn't I be asking you that
question?

38:10.992 --> 38:13.895
- Shit.
- Quite.

38:14.095 --> 38:16.631
Let's see if I can...

38:23.805 --> 38:26.874
Well, that's a bit...
personal. But OK.

38:28.676 --> 38:30.077
Congratulations.

38:31.746 --> 38:33.981
Oh, unless she's not your wife.

38:34.749 --> 38:36.551
- She is.
- Good.

38:38.252 --> 38:41.289
You don't seem the type to go around
having affairs and unhappy accidents.

38:42.824 --> 38:46.761
Oh, what is it?
Have I wounded your pride?

38:47.094 --> 38:50.330
Affairs maybe, accidents
definitely not?

38:50.932 --> 38:53.801
Hm. I'm afraid that doesn't seem
quite right either.

38:55.603 --> 39:00.875
Maybe it's that you are a good boy, and you know you are,
but you sort of hoped you'd come across otherwise?

39:01.876 --> 39:03.811
OK, no, that's too much.

39:04.011 --> 39:08.348
What type are you, then? I don't
think I've figured it out.

39:10.651 --> 39:11.619
Sorry.

39:14.755 --> 39:18.793
- Let's just see if we can get the door open again.
- Excellent idea.

39:20.828 --> 39:23.030
Isn't it a bit weird to just
send that?

39:24.665 --> 39:25.900
Instead of calling?

39:27.335 --> 39:30.805
Of course, I don't know. I don't
know how you two communicate.

39:31.005 --> 39:33.140
I've seen people post those
things on line.

39:33.341 --> 39:35.877
For starters, she just pissed on
that, it's gross.

39:36.077 --> 39:38.946
And isn't it way too early to be
making announcements?

39:39.146 --> 39:45.887
Posting an ultrasound I can almost understand,
but even then it's way too much information.

39:46.721 --> 39:48.856
Invading the kid's privacy
before it's even a kid.

39:49.657 --> 39:52.727
- Now you just sound like a threatened...
- I don't care.

39:54.662 --> 39:59.000
I just hope that when the time comes,
you'll remember this conversation

39:59.200 --> 40:01.903
and think twice before
uploading.

40:03.070 --> 40:04.105
You and your lady.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.708
Diana.

40:09.210 --> 40:12.013
Now there's someone with
considerate parents.

40:12.847 --> 40:14.515
Goddess of the moon.

40:14.982 --> 40:16.550
Mistress of the hunt.

40:17.818 --> 40:20.755
- Princess of the Wales.
- That too.

40:24.926 --> 40:28.461
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

40:30.231 --> 40:32.166
Are we stuck in here?

41:30.291 --> 41:35.596
Do you not think the charms of a fine
night may even exceed those of the day?

41:36.030 --> 41:39.233
Yes. The day's beauty is
blonde and brilliant,

41:39.433 --> 41:43.170
but the beauty of the night is
brunette, which is more touching.

41:44.038 --> 41:48.642
You are very generous to give favour
to the brunette, being so fair yourself.

41:51.078 --> 41:52.646
It is certainly true,

41:54.248 --> 41:56.917
that an unclouded sun is one of the
most beautiful things in nature,

41:57.184 --> 42:00.221
and the most beautiful things in
the imagination,

42:00.421 --> 42:05.026
the heroines of our romances,
always seem to be blonde too.

42:06.360 --> 42:09.196
Even if I did believe you, I
shouldn't be satisfied,

42:09.397 --> 42:13.534
since the blonde brightness of day has
still so little effect on your heart.

42:14.201 --> 42:18.105
Why do lovers, the best judges
of what stirs our emotions,

42:18.305 --> 42:22.076
address all their poetic
effusions only to the night?

42:22.376 --> 42:24.945
Everything is softer in
starlight.

42:25.179 --> 42:30.051
We feel freer to be alone with
our pensive pleasures.

42:31.752 --> 42:36.157
Besides, the day sky shows us
only the sun,

42:36.357 --> 42:40.995
where the night gives its great
scattering of innumerable stars.

42:41.195 --> 42:46.801
I love the stars, I'm almost
angry with the sun for hiding them.

42:48.702 --> 42:53.240
I cannot forgive him for making
me lose sight of so many worlds.

42:53.441 --> 42:57.344
Worlds? What do you mean?

42:58.179 --> 42:59.613
Pardon me.

43:00.414 --> 43:02.716
You've struck a chord with my
imagination.

43:02.917 --> 43:05.586
I forget myself in a romantic
idea.

43:05.786 --> 43:09.290
And what romantic idea is
this?

43:11.358 --> 43:13.694
I'm half-ashamed to admit it.

43:14.862 --> 43:20.267
I have a notion that every star
may well be a world.

43:21.102 --> 43:25.706
I will not swear to it, but I think it so.
Because it pleases me to think so,

43:26.140 --> 43:29.210
and I believe that pleasure is
an accessory to truth.

43:29.410 --> 43:33.380
Well, if there's such a pleasure in it,
I'll believe the stars are anything you say.

43:33.582 --> 43:42.123
Oh, madam, no, it is not an enjoyment as you'd
find in seeing one of Molière's comedies:

43:42.490 --> 43:47.294
it is a pleasure of reason. It
delights only the mind.

43:48.796 --> 43:52.666
Do you think me incapable of
pleasures which depend only on reason?

43:53.267 --> 43:57.705
I'll show you your mistake.
Teach me about your stars.

43:59.306 --> 44:02.309
No. Let it never be said that
on an

44:02.511 --> 44:05.679
enchanted evening walk with the
most interesting and beautiful

44:05.880 --> 44:09.183
woman I know, that all I did was
talk about philosophy.

44:11.185 --> 44:12.253
Well,

44:15.222 --> 44:16.724
what's wrong with philosophy?

44:42.016 --> 44:43.684
Here we are.

44:45.152 --> 44:48.389
Well, I guess there is a plus
side to having parked over here.

44:48.590 --> 44:51.725
Assuming our rescuer ever
arrives.

44:58.265 --> 45:00.234
While we're waiting,

45:00.502 --> 45:03.837
I'm very interested to hear more
of your literary analysis.

45:04.038 --> 45:09.076
Well, I'm not at all sure you're being sincere, but
I'm going to press on anyway because this is important:

45:09.843 --> 45:12.780
the question of whether it's
feminist or not... the idea of this

45:12.980 --> 45:16.083
philosopher mansplaining the
whole universe to the marquise.

45:16.518 --> 45:20.788
Of course what we understand as
feminist is from a modern point of view,

45:21.021 --> 45:22.856
and in fact he was writing in an
era

45:24.526 --> 45:26.860
when men felt super-threatened by
women who wanted to educate themselves.

45:27.596 --> 45:29.964
Aren't we still in that era?

45:30.264 --> 45:32.766
Oh, look at you, scoring
points.

45:33.968 --> 45:39.039
The thing is, the marquise chooses to spend
time with him, and to learn about astronomy.

45:39.507 --> 45:44.979
There's a lot of other much less engaging things
she would have been expected to be doing instead.

45:45.446 --> 45:50.050
And there are definitely moments when she doesn't put
up with his bullshit, his supposed "gallantries".

45:50.552 --> 45:52.052
I think there's something to
that.

45:54.522 --> 45:59.793
Fontenelle's entire literary reputation depended on him coming
up through salons, which were created and run by women.

46:00.562 --> 46:02.863
I don't think he was being
condescending.

46:03.565 --> 46:05.432
Or at least he was trying not to
be.

46:06.568 --> 46:09.136
He lived almost to 100, and
there's this story

46:09.571 --> 46:14.775
about how he met a young woman
not long before he died,

46:15.577 --> 46:19.913
and said, "Ah, madame. If only I
were eighty again!"

46:20.381 --> 46:24.918
Fine, I do get the humour and
that it's supposed to be charming,

46:25.119 --> 46:27.154
but on the other hand, it's a
bit of a creepy move.

46:27.388 --> 46:29.990
Oh come on, give the guy a
break.

46:30.190 --> 46:34.862
I only point this out to show that
I hold my monsieur to a high standard

46:35.563 --> 46:38.165
Anyway, apparently he never married.

46:38.533 --> 46:41.536
Oh my God. Was he just covering
for being gay?

46:42.036 --> 46:45.072
And all this was last-minute
reputation insurance?

46:45.272 --> 46:49.109
I'm sure there's some postgraduate
student somewhere investigating.

46:50.477 --> 46:52.946
It always gets political and
complicated,

46:53.548 --> 46:54.915
everybody's flawed.

46:57.552 --> 46:59.019
Calvados.

46:59.688 --> 47:00.954
The good stuff.

47:03.090 --> 47:04.458
What would that look like?

47:04.659 --> 47:07.161
I mean, would we rent these
places out?

47:08.462 --> 47:11.098
No, no. I couldn't be a
landlord.

47:12.734 --> 47:16.203
Maybe start a commune?

47:17.271 --> 47:18.972
Those places never last.

47:19.173 --> 47:20.240
People always fall out.

47:20.642 --> 47:23.277
I know. We could open a B&B.

47:23.977 --> 47:26.246
Probably not a lost cause in
terms of planning permission.

47:26.514 --> 47:28.982
And it's not a bad compromise:
sort of renters,

47:29.183 --> 47:31.218
sort of commune. There's a
turnover built in,

47:31.418 --> 47:32.986
before we get sick of people.

47:34.321 --> 47:36.957
You could host your salons.
Invite some philosophers.

47:37.991 --> 47:40.861
Nice to get at least a little
bit off the grid.

47:41.529 --> 47:44.865
Not have to be chasing a mobile
phone signal all the time.

47:48.670 --> 47:51.238
Isn't it something how much we
think about ourselves, but

47:52.741 --> 47:54.274
barely know who we are?

47:55.943 --> 47:58.912
To paraphrase a certain French writer
friend of mine from the old days:

47:59.647 --> 48:02.182
God must have been drunk when he
created us,

48:02.550 --> 48:04.985
and laughed his ass off when he
sobered up.

48:12.059 --> 48:14.596
Just curious, though,

48:15.229 --> 48:17.331
how far away is this locksmith
you called?

48:17.699 --> 48:19.233
Oh, hush.

48:33.447 --> 48:37.685
In truth, it's actually a lot
smaller than I remember.

48:38.118 --> 48:40.087
Well, you've grown.

48:47.695 --> 48:49.196
What are you doing here,
Bernard?

48:59.206 --> 49:02.943
The family that your bank got
rid of...

49:04.077 --> 49:09.049
And the one, perpetually
unmentioned, casualty of that deal...

49:09.283 --> 49:10.685
Your Dad...

49:14.689 --> 49:16.490
So that makes you the enemy.

49:20.394 --> 49:21.295
But how can you be?

49:23.263 --> 49:25.132
You were just a kid when it
happened.

49:26.501 --> 49:28.503
And whilst I was getting myself
all torn up about

49:28.703 --> 49:31.972
whether I was French or English,
posh or not,

49:32.439 --> 49:35.008
a poor orphan or just some
spoiled brat...

49:35.209 --> 49:37.978
Well, whatever you were doing,

49:38.813 --> 49:42.149
probably wasn't with any malice
towards me or my family.

49:42.517 --> 49:44.485
That's absolutely true.

49:46.788 --> 49:50.324
In my mind I went through a few
versions of how this could go.

49:52.259 --> 49:54.361
Nothing violent or anything,
don't worry.

50:00.434 --> 50:02.302
What am I doing here?

50:05.272 --> 50:07.074
I don't even know.

50:09.343 --> 50:14.582
But whatever it is, I couldn't just call up your company
and demand a whole afternoon of your time for it.

50:15.282 --> 50:16.584
No, I needed a story.

50:17.552 --> 50:20.555
So, I was a film location
finder.

50:21.388 --> 50:23.290
A tech start-up big-shot.

50:23.625 --> 50:26.426
A philosopher-scientist of the
17th century!

50:30.330 --> 50:33.300
It's not easy to find your place
in this world, Maggie.

50:34.167 --> 50:36.303
Let alone the whole cosmic
scheme.

50:38.305 --> 50:41.375
I actually did work at a couple
of TV shows.

50:41.576 --> 50:44.679
Rock bottom assistant, thanks to
an uncle who knew someone.

50:45.312 --> 50:47.649
And flirted with the idea of
making something out of it.

50:48.248 --> 50:50.150
Even did time in Los Angeles,

50:50.450 --> 50:53.353
which was fucking awful.

50:54.589 --> 50:57.457
Worse than law school, which,
yes, I did start

50:57.659 --> 51:01.328
with the intention of suing the
shit out of your employer.

51:02.329 --> 51:05.399
But which I promptly dropped out
of.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.200
Of course.

51:09.003 --> 51:13.206
And yes, I did work at one of those vaguely
sinister tech companies for a while,

51:14.341 --> 51:16.243
also without distinction...

51:16.476 --> 51:18.178
until I got the sack.

51:18.580 --> 51:20.480
And no, she doesn't know.

51:25.285 --> 51:29.557
They'd probably turn this place into
some high-tech secret headquarters.

51:30.925 --> 51:33.460
Your company been approached by
anyone like that?

51:33.661 --> 51:37.297
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Good! That's good.

51:37.599 --> 51:39.232
I fucking hate those...

51:39.433 --> 51:41.134
I don't even know where they
come from.

51:43.004 --> 51:44.772
I am definitely not one of these little shits
who think they can walk out of any job

51:44.973 --> 51:47.174
and get snapped right up by some
other company.

51:47.407 --> 51:51.178
The bratty egomaniacs who just
retire at our age.

51:52.513 --> 51:54.214
Guess I'm not a go-getter.

51:55.750 --> 51:58.519
I don't know what I am,
but I am definitely not a petty go-getter.

51:59.319 --> 52:00.454
Hey, I know what you are.

52:01.388 --> 52:02.189
What?

52:03.524 --> 52:05.392
You're nine months away from
being someone's father.

52:05.593 --> 52:06.426
Fuck!

52:07.394 --> 52:09.463
Just thought I'd point that
out.

52:09.998 --> 52:12.232
Thank you so much.

52:15.670 --> 52:16.804
It's interesting.

52:18.338 --> 52:19.674
Can I see that message again?

52:28.315 --> 52:29.651
D'you know what that is?

52:30.051 --> 52:31.686
I have a pretty good idea.

52:33.087 --> 52:36.658
No, I mean the image itself:
the circle with a cross in it.

52:39.827 --> 52:43.363
That's the ancient symbol of the
Sun. The solar cross.

52:43.564 --> 52:46.433
But at some point they changed it.
Like if you look on the NASA website,

52:46.634 --> 52:48.435
you'll see that now it's the
symbol of the Earth.

52:48.636 --> 52:51.906
At some point the sun symbol
became a circle with a dot in it,

52:52.106 --> 52:55.710
and that symbol was adopted as
the official symbol of the Earth.

52:57.545 --> 52:58.378
Who knew?

53:00.715 --> 53:02.583
That actually is very
interesting.

53:05.887 --> 53:09.423
- What do you think good ol' Fontenelle would make of that?
- Exactly!

53:09.624 --> 53:13.661
Or maybe just think it was a
really cool coincidence.

53:20.868 --> 53:26.473
"I've failed as a father," that's what
he'd say, over and over and over again,

53:28.475 --> 53:30.477
mostly with something like this
in his hand.

53:31.779 --> 53:34.448
He could get so sodden with
self-pity.

53:35.415 --> 53:36.551
But he wasn't wrong.

53:38.753 --> 53:40.621
I don't know who to be angry
with,

53:41.656 --> 53:43.758
but I'm sure as hell not ready
to be a parent.

53:43.958 --> 53:44.859
Who is?

53:46.527 --> 53:49.964
- Well isn't that just such a fucking cliché.
- Yeah, for a reason, though.

53:50.164 --> 53:51.532
Well it pisses me off.

53:53.601 --> 53:56.637
I say I'm not ready, and
unfailingly, that's the answer.

53:56.838 --> 53:58.806
As if I somehow no longer even
have any say in it all.

53:59.006 --> 54:00.742
Well I do have a say. I demand a
say.

54:02.844 --> 54:04.979
And I know it's selfish, and selfishness is
precisely the thing you need to learn to do without

54:05.179 --> 54:06.814
in order to be ready.

54:07.014 --> 54:08.883
Yeah, learn to.

54:09.650 --> 54:11.451
And that takes a while.

54:13.187 --> 54:15.757
We humans have a reasonably long gestation
period, so that buys you some time.

54:15.957 --> 54:20.528
No one even wants to believe there's
a possibility I'd make a crap father.

54:20.728 --> 54:23.430
And so they'd just pretend
otherwise, and then, what?

54:23.831 --> 54:26.433
when I have a messed-up kid,

54:26.634 --> 54:30.772
they'll just, what?... suddenly
all be shocked.

54:35.076 --> 54:36.677
"They fuck you up..."

54:40.815 --> 54:42.683
"...your Mum and Dad."

54:45.686 --> 54:47.522
"They may not mean to..."

54:48.956 --> 54:51.058
"...but they do."

54:59.700 --> 55:01.736
Imagine if they built a huge
spaceship

55:01.936 --> 55:06.541
where the idea was to travel for
generations to reach another solar system,

55:06.908 --> 55:08.776
and they all got cooped up and
sick of each other,

55:08.976 --> 55:10.812
and someone had brought that
poem,

55:11.012 --> 55:13.848
and it was, you know, like
subversive literature,

55:14.882 --> 55:18.986
and they all had a revolution of
deliberately refusing to reproduce,

55:19.187 --> 55:23.724
and so that by the time that ship
actually reached another world,

55:25.126 --> 55:29.362
all those aliens would only find
dead bodies.

55:32.934 --> 55:36.571
Is this something you've been working on?
Are you trying this out on me?

55:36.771 --> 55:38.338
No, just came up with it now.

55:39.874 --> 55:42.109
But I like it! Maybe I should
give this film business a go, eh?

55:42.310 --> 55:44.111
Definitely. Yeah, yeah, you
should.

55:47.048 --> 55:49.116
You're a very tolerant person,
Bernard.

55:50.885 --> 55:52.352
I appreciate that.

55:52.954 --> 55:54.655
- Am I?
- Yeah.

55:55.790 --> 55:57.925
Good dad material, I'm telling
you.

55:58.993 --> 56:00.061
Christ.

56:02.730 --> 56:04.031
You should call her back.

56:05.933 --> 56:08.035
It's not like you to torture her
this way.

56:10.037 --> 56:12.874
- How could you possibly know that?
- I don't know.

56:14.008 --> 56:14.909
I hope.

56:17.178 --> 56:19.379
We're just not at ease any
more.

56:20.748 --> 56:21.782
Not together.

56:22.950 --> 56:25.853
We tried having a baby and it
wasn't working,

56:26.053 --> 56:28.656
so I wanted to use that as a
weapon, to say...

56:29.056 --> 56:33.094
there you have it. The universe is
telling us we don't belong together.

56:34.095 --> 56:35.129
I didn't say it.

56:36.864 --> 56:38.032
I don't believe it.

56:40.134 --> 56:42.770
Not because I think we belong together, but because
I think there's no such thing as belonging.

56:44.038 --> 56:45.873
The universe tells us nothing.

56:46.908 --> 56:48.109
It's not conscious.

56:49.476 --> 56:52.847
And if it is, it's clearly
indifferent to the likes of us.

56:55.950 --> 56:58.819
We have an awful habit of
shutting each other down.

57:00.087 --> 57:01.122
We've become...

57:02.156 --> 57:03.157
ungenerous.

57:16.237 --> 57:18.072
Wonder how long that guy's going
to take.

57:19.573 --> 57:20.942
Could be in here for the night.

57:21.943 --> 57:25.212
Pity; the sunsets are nice here
this time of year.

57:29.216 --> 57:30.551
I'm a loser too, you know.

57:32.787 --> 57:35.122
- I don't think I used that word exactly.
- This job...

57:35.923 --> 57:39.827
if I'm being honest about it...
is undeniably the safe choice.

57:40.928 --> 57:45.166
I'm into pasty-faced poets and
sci-fi and astronomy,

57:45.800 --> 57:47.134
but look how I spend my days.

57:48.569 --> 57:50.871
If I'd known, when I was little,
about the Plurality of Worlds,

57:52.740 --> 57:55.009
I don't mean the actual plurality of worlds;
I think I probably did know about that.

57:55.242 --> 57:58.112
Which by the way is a testament
to something:

57:58.312 --> 58:00.614
if a girl like me can take that
knowledge for granted,

58:00.848 --> 58:04.518
when back then even an
aristocratic woman wasn't expected

58:04.719 --> 58:05.953
to know or even quite fathom it,

58:06.153 --> 58:08.022
well, then, that is saying
something about...

58:08.622 --> 58:12.026
I don't know... grace, I
suppose.

58:13.094 --> 58:15.029
Anyway, if I'd known about this,

58:15.629 --> 58:18.199
I just know it would have
inspired me to be

58:18.899 --> 58:20.034
a scientist,

58:20.901 --> 58:22.069
or a writer,

58:23.404 --> 58:25.039
or at the very least someone
who dresses up as something

58:26.273 --> 58:27.174
interesting and goes to
Comic-Con once in a while.

58:29.210 --> 58:30.945
But I really think it's too
late.

58:32.279 --> 58:33.714
You're not even 30.

58:34.048 --> 58:35.649
That's presumptuous,

58:37.118 --> 58:39.954
but also the most optimistic
thing I think I've heard you say.

58:40.955 --> 58:41.522
Yeah.

58:43.124 --> 58:44.925
What has come over me?

58:47.161 --> 58:51.032
Maybe there's a parallel universe where
it worked out better for both of us.

58:52.733 --> 58:55.202
And probably at least one
where it worked out worse.

58:55.403 --> 58:58.739
Well I don't if that's
pessimistic or optimistic, but yeah,

58:59.440 --> 59:00.741
probably.

59:03.077 --> 59:04.678
Too many possibilities.

59:08.315 --> 59:10.985
I hope you don't just think
I'm some fantasy girl,

59:11.786 --> 59:13.220
an escape from it all.

59:14.088 --> 59:15.689
Now that's presumptuous.

59:18.125 --> 59:19.326
Don't look at me.

59:20.227 --> 59:22.096
You're the one driving this
thing.

1:00:38.439 --> 1:00:40.307
- Is it my fault?
- I'm sorry?

1:00:40.509 --> 1:00:43.144
- I probably should have gone to the other...
- Oh, not at all.

1:00:43.512 --> 1:00:45.880
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:48.883
- Did you get spun around?
- That's all right.

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:49.884
Are you sure?

1:00:50.484 --> 1:00:51.719
Absolutely.

1:00:54.488 --> 1:00:57.191
Well, you are indeed English.

1:00:57.391 --> 1:00:59.793
- And so are you!
- Partially, anyway.

1:00:59.994 --> 1:01:00.928
Right.

1:01:02.830 --> 1:01:05.666
I realize it may have been a bit presumptuous
of me to think you'd enjoy a look around.

1:01:05.900 --> 1:01:07.401
What? No!

1:01:07.602 --> 1:01:09.770
I mean, no, not presumptuous.
Not at all.

1:01:10.204 --> 1:01:12.339
- Of course I wanted to look around.
- OK, good.

1:01:13.575 --> 1:01:16.677
How dickish would it have been
to accept a stranger's

1:01:16.877 --> 1:01:21.382
very specific invitation, come all this
way, and then just tell her to eff off?

1:01:21.583 --> 1:01:26.220
Right, but what if it had been
10 or 15 years ago?

1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:29.223
That might be exactly what I'd
have done, yeah.

1:01:29.890 --> 1:01:31.660
Well, good timing then.

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:34.361
Shall we?

1:01:37.431 --> 1:01:40.734
Now, I must warn you, it's
getting pretty run down.

1:01:40.935 --> 1:01:44.338
Yeah, I've braced myself as
best I can.

1:01:44.972 --> 1:01:46.407
How long has it been?

1:01:46.608 --> 1:01:48.008
Many years.

1:01:48.409 --> 1:01:50.344
I don't know. I've lost count.

1:01:52.046 --> 1:01:56.016
There was a highly regrettable druggy
dropout period just after law school,

1:01:56.317 --> 1:01:59.386
when I occasionally would drive
past the place to see...

1:02:00.522 --> 1:02:03.023
I don't know... to see if it was
even real.

1:02:04.458 --> 1:02:06.760
That quickly felt pathetic.

1:02:07.394 --> 1:02:08.563
It wasn't even conclusive:

1:02:09.263 --> 1:02:12.733
right now, for instance, it
seems less real than ever.

1:02:13.602 --> 1:02:15.002
To me too, actually.

1:02:17.037 --> 1:02:19.406
It's a shame we're late for all
the wild strawberries.

1:02:19.641 --> 1:02:22.343
Fontenelle swore that
strawberries made him live longer.

1:02:22.977 --> 1:02:24.745
He made it to almost 100,
didn't he?

1:02:25.446 --> 1:02:26.146
That's right.

1:02:27.414 --> 1:02:29.016
Good ol' Fontenelle.

1:02:31.418 --> 1:02:33.320
It is bizarre to see it like
this.

1:02:34.388 --> 1:02:37.925
Obviously better than a
fucking golf course. But still.

1:02:38.158 --> 1:02:42.029
Well, as you know, French
property law being what it is...

1:02:42.229 --> 1:02:44.999
I know. Protects the history
and all that.

1:02:45.567 --> 1:02:48.035
But to see it empty, it's
tragic.

1:02:49.036 --> 1:02:50.170
I agree.

1:02:53.107 --> 1:02:56.443
So you're telling me you haven't
had offers from any insufferable

1:02:56.645 --> 1:02:59.847
filthy rich tech brats looking
to turn it into, I dunno,

1:03:00.180 --> 1:03:04.451
the company's Thursday afternoon massage
parlor-slash-super-soldier cloning lab?

1:03:05.386 --> 1:03:06.920
No serious offers.

1:03:07.121 --> 1:03:08.822
Do you know anyone who's in the
market?

1:03:09.524 --> 1:03:10.858
No one who'd admit it.

1:03:11.458 --> 1:03:12.793
So,

1:03:13.927 --> 1:03:16.196
here we are. At last.

1:03:18.132 --> 1:03:21.035
In my mind I ran through a few
versions of how this could go.

1:03:21.603 --> 1:03:22.570
Oh?

1:03:23.971 --> 1:03:26.541
You probably worked out I
stalked you a little bit online.

1:03:28.475 --> 1:03:31.478
And I imagined all sorts of reasons you might
have to come here so that I could meet you.

1:03:32.946 --> 1:03:34.481
Definitely presumptuous.

1:03:34.683 --> 1:03:37.484
And I got a little bit carried
away.

1:04:28.102 --> 1:04:32.139
Anyway, talk about making something
more complicated than it needs to be.

1:04:33.107 --> 1:04:36.877
So finally I just worked up the
nerve to get in touch.

1:04:38.078 --> 1:04:42.015
- I hope it wasn't too weird.
- No, not too weird.

1:04:43.651 --> 1:04:45.252
I mean, it's completely weird.

1:04:45.452 --> 1:04:49.089
But not you. The place. The
circumstances.

1:04:49.557 --> 1:04:50.124
Right.

1:04:51.659 --> 1:04:54.995
And I hope you'll forgive me if
I've become familiar too quickly.

1:04:56.196 --> 1:04:57.164
I don't know.

1:04:58.633 --> 1:05:00.668
What's too quickly by your
standards?

1:05:00.869 --> 1:05:03.203
To be honest, I don't really
have a standard.

1:05:03.404 --> 1:05:04.271
Me neither.

1:05:07.441 --> 1:05:10.612
You don't have a pregnant wife who's
waiting to hear from you, do you?

1:05:10.812 --> 1:05:12.179
What?

1:05:16.718 --> 1:05:19.186
No! I hope not...

1:05:20.655 --> 1:05:22.322
No. I'm not married

1:05:23.457 --> 1:05:24.324
Divorced.

1:05:26.828 --> 1:05:30.330
OK. So this is a gravitational
question.

1:05:31.766 --> 1:05:35.002
Would you say, if you had to
choose either/or,

1:05:35.436 --> 1:05:40.340
you're someone who leaves,
generally, or someone who gets left?

1:05:41.074 --> 1:05:45.112
Or, someone who attracts, or
someone who becomes attracted?

1:05:49.216 --> 1:05:50.951
I don't even know anymore.

1:05:51.151 --> 1:05:53.287
Gravity's still such a
mystery, isn't it?

1:05:54.756 --> 1:05:57.024
And, not to pry,

1:05:57.224 --> 1:06:00.994
but OK yes, to pry a little...

1:06:02.831 --> 1:06:05.499
the offspring situation?

1:06:11.405 --> 1:06:15.075
I was all for them, actually,
but things didn't work out.

1:06:16.343 --> 1:06:17.444
We were young.

1:06:18.513 --> 1:06:20.515
Probably for the best, to tell
the truth.

1:06:21.381 --> 1:06:22.550
I pushed way too hard.

1:06:23.217 --> 1:06:25.352
Perhaps overcompensating

1:06:25.553 --> 1:06:28.021
- for everything.
- Of course.

1:06:28.388 --> 1:06:30.390
I mean, not of course but...

1:06:31.559 --> 1:06:33.427
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1:06:34.261 --> 1:06:35.996
It was a long time ago now.

1:06:39.266 --> 1:06:43.003
Well, the place does feel a
little bit haunted.

1:06:43.905 --> 1:06:49.777
But seriously Maggie, I think that's because
nothing's been done to it since we left!

1:06:52.279 --> 1:06:53.581
What's the plan?

1:06:54.849 --> 1:06:57.184
- What are you going to do to turn it around?
- I know.

1:06:58.185 --> 1:06:59.286
Oh, I'm just joking.

1:07:00.254 --> 1:07:01.021
Sorry,

1:07:02.222 --> 1:07:05.292
I don't know why I'm teasing
you. We've just met.

1:07:08.830 --> 1:07:11.198
I suppose it always felt a
little bit haunted.

1:07:11.566 --> 1:07:13.133
In good ways, too.

1:07:14.167 --> 1:07:16.169
The place has definitely been
through a lot.

1:07:25.647 --> 1:07:27.114
Still here.

1:07:28.315 --> 1:07:29.483
Christ.

1:07:30.284 --> 1:07:32.085
That's just unbearably sad.

1:07:32.286 --> 1:07:33.420
I know.

1:07:36.189 --> 1:07:37.457
Have you got a pencil?

1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:39.561
I've got a pen.

1:07:40.294 --> 1:07:42.296
That's good. That's better.

1:08:10.592 --> 1:08:14.127
- I think that's actually even more sad now.
- It really is, isn't it?

1:08:14.328 --> 1:08:15.730
- What have we done?
- I know.

1:08:16.363 --> 1:08:19.466
It wasn't enough to repossess our
sprawling manse and let it rot?

1:08:19.667 --> 1:08:22.369
- But now you have to go and scribble all over the walls?
- Stop it.

1:08:22.570 --> 1:08:25.405
God, I'm being... horrible.

1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:27.709
That was a bit much.

1:08:27.909 --> 1:08:31.211
It was. Forgive me, Maggie!

1:10:01.936 --> 1:10:03.738
How did you even get this?

1:10:04.471 --> 1:10:05.773
Just don't tell my boss.

1:10:06.808 --> 1:10:07.909
Or sue him.

1:10:08.910 --> 1:10:10.343
Please.

1:10:13.581 --> 1:10:15.516
I loved this book when I was
younger.

1:10:17.919 --> 1:10:21.488
I didn't understand it. Almost
did.

1:10:23.524 --> 1:10:24.625
I wanted to.

1:10:25.827 --> 1:10:28.495
I wanted to be a "philosopher"
when I grew up.

1:10:30.732 --> 1:10:32.767
Then we lost the house. And
Dad...

1:10:34.902 --> 1:10:37.538
Perfect training for a
philosopher, now I think about it.

1:10:39.874 --> 1:10:41.809
This is pretty much my
favourite book.

1:10:43.945 --> 1:10:45.880
So thanks for letting me borrow
it,

1:10:46.914 --> 1:10:48.683
however unwittingly.

1:10:50.918 --> 1:10:52.520
You're very welcome.

1:10:56.924 --> 1:11:01.261
It's mind-blowing to think there are
places like this all over France.

1:11:01.662 --> 1:11:03.497
All over Normandy, even.

1:11:03.698 --> 1:11:05.833
But this is one of a kind,
though, isn't it?

1:11:08.503 --> 1:11:10.872
Honestly, what do you think
will become of it?

1:11:12.607 --> 1:11:13.508
Don't laugh.

1:11:14.742 --> 1:11:17.044
I tried to get it turned into a
Fontenelle museum.

1:11:18.045 --> 1:11:19.279
Seriously?

1:11:21.616 --> 1:11:22.950
Tried to? Past tense?

1:11:23.151 --> 1:11:24.552
Didn't work.

1:11:26.821 --> 1:11:27.955
We should try again.

1:11:31.692 --> 1:11:35.295
There's just one other thing I'd
like to look for.

1:11:54.849 --> 1:11:56.984
Wait here, I'll be right back.

1:12:04.625 --> 1:12:05.927
<i>Et voilà!</i>

1:12:07.728 --> 1:12:11.364
Perhaps past its best, but I'm
willing to give it a go.

1:12:12.066 --> 1:12:13.601
Have a drink with me, Maggie.

1:12:14.802 --> 1:12:15.937
What is that stuff?

1:12:16.137 --> 1:12:17.872
Maggie! You disappoint me.

1:12:18.139 --> 1:12:19.874
What is this, you ask?

1:12:21.042 --> 1:12:22.610
Apple brandy?

1:12:22.810 --> 1:12:25.680
The best apple brandy! The
only.

1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:27.849
The pride of Normandy.

1:12:30.751 --> 1:12:32.620
You know who else had a thing
for apples?

1:12:33.788 --> 1:12:34.856
Isaac Newton.

1:12:36.057 --> 1:12:39.627
That great English shifter of
French paradigms.

1:12:40.027 --> 1:12:43.898
If we're going to drink to all the people who
got us here, we should drink to him too.

1:12:45.933 --> 1:12:49.804
And to gravity being a little bit
less of a mystery than it used to be.

1:12:53.975 --> 1:12:56.043
In my mind I was playing a
little game.

1:12:56.777 --> 1:12:59.146
If I only I could keep you here
till sunset...

1:13:00.181 --> 1:13:01.414
What would happen?

1:13:01.916 --> 1:13:02.917
No idea.

1:13:04.118 --> 1:13:06.888
Sometimes I lack imagination in
really odd ways.

1:13:10.057 --> 1:13:11.391
Do you know any stars?

1:13:12.093 --> 1:13:14.695
Not anymore. Not by name.

1:13:15.096 --> 1:13:18.465
You know there's this app where you
can hold your phone up towards the sky

1:13:18.532 --> 1:13:21.002
and it tells you the
constellations you're looking at.

1:13:21.068 --> 1:13:22.837
- That's amazing.
- I thought so.

1:13:23.137 --> 1:13:24.906
But it needs a mobile signal,

1:13:25.106 --> 1:13:27.474
so maybe we don't want to go off
the grid after all.

1:13:30.077 --> 1:13:32.479
And if there really are infinite
stars,

1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:36.050
does that mean that any constellation
you could possibly imagine,

1:13:36.250 --> 1:13:38.485
any little connect-the-dots you
could make,

1:13:38.953 --> 1:13:40.755
must exist somewhere?

1:13:41.555 --> 1:13:44.025
Like all you need is the proper
vantage point to see it from?

1:13:44.225 --> 1:13:46.127
And the propensity to look for
it.

1:13:46.794 --> 1:13:48.162
No shortage of that here.

1:13:50.731 --> 1:13:52.465
Well, think about the face in
the moon...

1:13:54.235 --> 1:13:56.469
it's a great big reminder of how it's in
our nature to see what we want to see.

1:13:58.005 --> 1:14:00.541
- Ourselves.
- Quite.

1:14:01.909 --> 1:14:05.813
Well! Sounds like we've got it
all sorted, doesn't it?

1:14:06.147 --> 1:14:06.881
What?

1:14:08.049 --> 1:14:08.950
The universe.

1:14:09.150 --> 1:14:11.919
Oh shit, I don't know.

1:14:12.119 --> 1:14:12.954
No?

1:14:13.821 --> 1:14:16.524
Well, the sun-earth situation,

1:14:17.091 --> 1:14:19.093
yeah, most people seem pretty
clear on that.

1:14:19.293 --> 1:14:22.096
But stuff like quantum
entanglement,

1:14:22.363 --> 1:14:25.099
the multiverse, what there was
before the Big Bang?

1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:26.466
Fuck!

1:14:27.768 --> 1:14:29.203
So there won't be another
moment where someone says,

1:14:30.204 --> 1:14:34.075
<i>Oh, actually, it's this.</i>

1:14:34.942 --> 1:14:38.012
<i>Yeah, that's much simpler,
that makes sense. It's this, everyone.</i>

1:14:38.212 --> 1:14:39.246
Theory of everything.

1:14:41.315 --> 1:14:42.883
Don't know. Could be.

1:14:43.284 --> 1:14:45.052
Teams are working on it, for
sure.

1:14:46.153 --> 1:14:47.154
Teams!

1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:54.562
If someone does crack it,

1:14:56.230 --> 1:14:58.632
they won't be burned at the
stake, will they?

1:14:59.033 --> 1:15:00.501
I would hope not.

1:15:01.235 --> 1:15:02.937
But you never know.

1:15:05.272 --> 1:15:07.008
All alone in the meantime.

1:15:08.909 --> 1:15:09.977
Alone together.

1:15:14.181 --> 1:15:18.919
There's this great part where the
Marquise talks about how it's overwhelming

1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:21.255
to realise our insignificance in
the universe.

1:15:22.156 --> 1:15:24.058
And the Philosopher says: <i>yes</i>,

1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:29.163
<i>but it doesn't lessen the charms of a
beautiful face, a fine pair of eyes...</i>

1:15:30.331 --> 1:15:36.303
as he puts it: <i>they retain their power in
spite of all the worlds that can be created.</i>

1:15:39.340 --> 1:15:42.309
Not bad. What does she say to
that?

1:15:44.678 --> 1:15:45.679
She says:

1:15:46.747 --> 1:15:48.215
<i>Love is a strange thing;</i>

1:15:49.283 --> 1:15:51.285
<i>it escapes every corrective,</i>

1:15:52.353 --> 1:15:55.289
<i>and no system of understanding
can reduce it.</i>
