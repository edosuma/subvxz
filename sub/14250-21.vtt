00:02.300 --> 00:04.100
Activate
the bio-temporaI chamber.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.000
Is she going to be aII right?

00:09.100 --> 00:11.000
Not if you don't aII
cIear out of here

00:11.000 --> 00:12.200
and Iet me do my work.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.900
She's my mother.
I'm staying.

00:13.900 --> 00:15.800
This is
a very deIicate procedure

00:15.800 --> 00:17.600
and I couId use
some peace and quiet.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.500
The Doctor's right.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.000
Let's Iet him do his work.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.100
AII right.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.500
I wish I'd toId you this before
but better Iate than never.

00:37.600 --> 00:41.000
You're the finest friend
I've ever had.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.900
Prepare to bring the
bio-temporaI chamber on Iine.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.100
We'II begin in approximateIy
five minutes.

00:53.100 --> 00:56.000
Grandma, are you awake?

00:59.700 --> 01:02.400
I brought you a present.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.700
Grandma Kes?

02:59.400 --> 03:01.800
I finaIIy finished making
your birthday present.

03:01.800 --> 03:06.000
Sorry it's Iate,
but I wanted to get it right.

03:06.100 --> 03:09.500
I... I don't know you.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.200
What do you mean?

03:11.200 --> 03:13.700
I'm Andrew...

03:13.700 --> 03:15.500
your grandson.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.000
I don't know you.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.800
Doctor.
Dr. van Gogh.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.400
What is it?

03:24.500 --> 03:26.400
She doesn't recognize me.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.400
Kes?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.500
How are you feeIing?

03:30.600 --> 03:31.600
Where am I?

03:31.600 --> 03:32.800
What is this pIace?

03:34.700 --> 03:36.300
You're in Sick Bay.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.300
Do you know who I am?

03:38.300 --> 03:39.700
No.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.600
Yes.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.500
I've seen you before.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.300
Do you know my name?

03:54.800 --> 03:58.100
The boy, he caIIed you
Dr. van Gogh.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.000
That's right.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.800
You said
I was your finest friend.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.000
WeII... I'm not sure
I've ever said that exactIy,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.500
but... that doesn't mean
it's not true.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.899
How couId I be your friend?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.500
I don't know you.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.900
TeII me what you do remember.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.900
Uh, peopIe around me,
crowded around me.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.800
You... a boy... a young girI.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.100
I was in a chamber...

04:43.400 --> 04:45.700
a bio-temporaI chamber.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.000
Good.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.200
I was inside it

04:48.200 --> 04:50.700
and you toId someone
to activate it.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.000
I'm afraid you're confused.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.200
I discussed the bio-temporaI
chamber with you,

04:56.200 --> 04:59.200
but we're not ready
to put you inside it just yet.

04:59.200 --> 05:03.800
Can you recaII anything eIse
besides those peopIe you saw?

05:03.800 --> 05:05.600
Anything eIse about your Iife?

05:08.800 --> 05:10.700
No.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Go find the rest of your famiIy.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:22.600 --> 05:23.900
What's the big hurry?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.200
I'm sorry, Captain.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.500
I have to go.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.400
What was that aII about?

05:30.400 --> 05:32.300
I'm afraid Kes
is getting worse, Captain.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.000
Her amnesia is near totaI.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.900
Fewer than one percent
of her engrams

05:36.900 --> 05:37.900
remained intact.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.500
It's as if her memory
were wiped cIean.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.500
Is it some sort of seniIity?

05:41.500 --> 05:44.300
Maybe. I've never treated
a nine-year-oId Ocampan before.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.700
For aII I know,

05:45.800 --> 05:48.600
it's a perfectIy normaI part
of their aging process.

05:48.700 --> 05:49.600
It's hard to beIieve

05:49.700 --> 05:51.600
that she performed
microsurgery on my eIbow

05:51.600 --> 05:52.800
just a few weeks ago.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.800
A few weeks ago,
she was a heaIthy woman,

05:54.900 --> 05:57.200
but this morilogium
comes on abruptIy

05:57.200 --> 05:58.300
and then progresses

05:58.300 --> 06:00.500
with a rapidity
I've never seen before.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.500
How are you coming aIong
with the bio-temporaI chamber?

06:03.500 --> 06:07.300
As I toId you, it's a compIeteIy
revoIutionary procedure.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.300
I have no idea if it'II work.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.600
Under normaI circumstances,

06:10.600 --> 06:13.900
I'd want to perform extensive
tests on the apparatus,

06:13.900 --> 06:15.500
but we're Iosing her too fast.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.600
If I don't try it now,
it may be too Iate.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.600
If you reaIIy beIieve
it wiII proIong her Iife...

06:19.600 --> 06:22.100
If we're Iucky, it may
buy her another year.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.000
I think you have
the famiIy's consent.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.400
You shouId go ahead
and do it.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.500
I'm so coId.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.100
I'm coId.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.700
No wonder.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.500
Your temperature has dropped
to 14.8--

06:35.600 --> 06:37.200
aImost two degrees beIow normaI.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.600
What does that mean?

06:38.700 --> 06:39.800
I'm not sure.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.400
What?

06:41.400 --> 06:43.700
Her ceIIs are in a state
of bio-temporaI fIux.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.700
I don't understand
how that couId be happening

06:45.700 --> 06:47.200
before I put her in the chamber.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.000
I'm coId.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Look, Mom, I'm aImost finished
with Grandma's present.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.500
It's wonderfuI, sweetheart.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.300
I'm sure Grandma wiII think
it was weII worth the wait.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.200
I hope so.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.300
I stiII feeI bad

07:49.300 --> 07:52.000
about not having it ready
in time for her party.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.900
HeIIo.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
How was your nap?

07:57.400 --> 07:58.500
Andrew?

07:58.600 --> 07:59.500
Grandma, don't Iook.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.500
You'II ruin the surprise.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.400
Why don't you sit down?

08:03.500 --> 08:05.100
I'II get you some tea.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.700
Where am I?

08:09.800 --> 08:11.400
In your quarters.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.800
What quarters?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.900
Aboard Voyager

08:16.900 --> 08:18.000
What's wrong?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.800
I don't know who you are.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.700
But you...

08:25.800 --> 08:27.800
I know who you are.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.900
TeII me what's happening.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.600
How did I get here?

08:32.600 --> 08:34.600
Andrew, get your grandfather
and father.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.400
TeII them to meet us
in Sick Bay.

08:36.400 --> 08:40.000
Yes... Sick Bay.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.200
I remember that pIace.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.299
I was just there.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.300
Uh, when?

08:46.300 --> 08:49.100
Just a few minutes ago.

08:49.200 --> 08:53.700
Dr. van Gogh
asked me some questions.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.400
I couIdn't remember anything.

08:57.500 --> 09:02.200
You haven't been
to Sick Bay for over a week--

09:02.300 --> 09:05.300
since you stopped working there.

09:05.300 --> 09:06.600
Working?

09:06.600 --> 09:07.600
What kind of work?

09:07.700 --> 09:08.600
Don't you remember?

09:08.700 --> 09:10.500
You were one
of the ship's doctors.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.900
I worked there with you.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.500
Who are you?

09:14.600 --> 09:18.600
I'm your daughter... Linnis.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.700
But I don't remember you.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.300
Do you remember anything at aII?

09:25.300 --> 09:28.900
Just peopIe crowded around me...

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
voices...

09:32.400 --> 09:34.200
The Doctor toId
everyone to Ieave

09:34.300 --> 09:35.800
and then he toId someone eIse

09:35.900 --> 09:38.700
to activate
the bio-temporaI chamber.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.700
He's been working on that.

09:39.700 --> 09:40.900
He may have mentioned it to you.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.500
And then I woke up

09:42.500 --> 09:44.800
and there was a boy...
Andrew...

09:44.800 --> 09:46.800
standing over me
with a present...

09:46.800 --> 09:49.200
caIIing me Grandma.

09:49.300 --> 09:52.000
But Andrew hasn't finished
your present yet.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.600
You just saw him
stiII working on it

09:53.700 --> 09:54.700
in your quarters.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.500
But he was there.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.800
The Doctor sent him
to get my famiIy

10:00.900 --> 10:03.000
and I was coId and I woke up
in that bed

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
in the quarters and...

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Maybe you were dreaming.

10:07.700 --> 10:11.000
I... I don't think so.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.300
WeII, none of the things
that you remember

10:13.300 --> 10:15.400
before waking from your nap
have happened.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.200
How do you know?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.600
Listen to me, Mother.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.000
You're confused right now

10:20.100 --> 10:22.300
and I'm sure
that's very frightening.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.000
But you need to trust me.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.100
I'm your daughter
and I Iove you.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.900
Now, pIease, come with me.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.100
Come.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.200
I've been expecting this.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.200
The onset of morilogium

10:38.400 --> 10:41.700
She's Iost more than 98 percent
of her memory engrams.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.400
Morilogium?

10:43.500 --> 10:47.200
The finaI phase of the Ocampan
Iife-span, Mother.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.800
Are you saying that I'm dying?

10:49.800 --> 10:51.600
Not if I can heIp it.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.300
What do you mean?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.200
Kes, it's me, Tom.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.600
Your husband.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.800
Tom.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.800
We're Iosing her.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.300
How Iong?

11:10.300 --> 11:12.800
If we do nothing,
a matter of weeks.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.800
But I'm working on something
to extend her Iife-span.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.200
It invoIves treating her
with a bio-temporaI fieId

11:18.200 --> 11:19.900
in order to push her ceIIs back

11:19.900 --> 11:22.000
to an earIier stage
of entropic decay.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.000
It's highIy experimentaI,

11:23.100 --> 11:25.600
but if it works, it might
buy her some time.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.500
No.
My mother's aIways accepted

11:27.500 --> 11:29.600
that she wouId
onIy Iive nine years.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.200
If she's reaching
the naturaI end of her Iife,

11:31.300 --> 11:34.200
she wouIdn't want extraordinary
measures taken to extend it.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.000
EspeciaIIy not in the state
she's in now.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.000
If the Doctor has a way
to keep your mother with us,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.100
even for one more day,
we have to Iet him try.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.700
We're not taIking about
a tested medicaI procedure here.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.300
We're taIking
about a radicaI experiment.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.300
Sweetheart, I understand
how upsetting this is.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.000
But if it were you
on that bio-bed,

11:49.200 --> 11:50.900
I'd feeI just Iike Tom does.

11:50.900 --> 11:53.200
Everyone, Iisten to me, pIease.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.700
Yes, Iisten to her.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.000
Mother, teII us what you want.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.200
I want to know
what's going on here.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.100
Maybe the morilogium
is causing my amnesia,

12:00.200 --> 12:01.500
but that doesn't expIain

12:01.500 --> 12:04.600
how I seem to suddenIy jump
from Sick Bay to my quarters,

12:04.600 --> 12:09.000
or how I remember being
in a bio-temporaI chamber.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.400
Kes, it's possibIe
the morilogium

12:10.500 --> 12:12.200
is causing you
to experience deIusions.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.600
No, they're not deIusions!

12:13.600 --> 12:14.600
I want you to Iie down.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.600
No.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.700
Leave her aIone.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.100
Your grandmother's very sick,
son.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.100
Maybe, but she's not deIusionaI.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.000
She's the smartest person
I know.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.200
We shouId Iisten to her.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.500
Oh, I'm coId.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.200
Her body temperature
has dropped 2.7 degrees.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.200
...For she's
a joIIy good feIIow

12:35.300 --> 12:38.000
For she's a joIIy good feIIow

12:38.100 --> 12:42.800
For she's
a joIIy good feIIow

12:42.800 --> 12:45.800
Which nobody can deny.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.900
Happy ninth, Kes.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.000
WeII, go ahead.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.600
Make a wish.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.200
WeII, what are you waiting for?

12:58.200 --> 12:59.200
BIow out the candIes.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.800
It's good to see that oId Iung
is stiII working, Kessy.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.600
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.700
Why, you know, I haven't
made one of these

13:16.700 --> 13:19.500
since... weII, since I
became Security Officer.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
Perhaps you wouId care
to reIinquish your commission

13:21.500 --> 13:24.500
and return to the scene
of your former triumphs.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.500
You keep working

13:25.500 --> 13:28.000
on that sense of humor,
Commander VuIcan.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.400
You'II get it one of these days.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.900
JimbaIian fudge-- your favorite.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.900
Some of us ought to be
watching our caIories,

13:35.900 --> 13:38.300
but after aII, it is
a speciaI occasion.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.600
Andrew.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.200
I'm sorry I don't have a
present for you, Grandma.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.000
I've got an idea
for something speciaI

13:49.000 --> 13:50.500
I'm going to make,
but I've been

13:50.500 --> 13:51.700
too busy with schooIwork.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.900
I haven't had a chance
to start it.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.400
I think it'II be worth the wait.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.100
Come and taIk to Grandma
for a minute, wiII you?

13:57.200 --> 13:58.100
Sure.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.700
I'm going to ask
you a few questions

13:59.800 --> 14:01.100
and I want you
to think very carefuIIy

14:01.100 --> 14:03.100
before you answer them,
aII right?

14:03.200 --> 14:05.000
I aIways think before I speak.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.400
You taught me that.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.800
Where were you before you
came to this party?

14:09.800 --> 14:12.400
At my physics Iesson
in Engineering.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.700
And then you came directIy here?

14:14.700 --> 14:16.900
No. I stopped at your quarters
to get you.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.400
Don't you remember?

14:18.500 --> 14:20.500
Andrew, stop monopoIizing
your grandmother's time.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.500
There are other peopIe
who'd wouId Iike to wish her

14:22.500 --> 14:23.600
a happy birthday, you know.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.600
She's aII yours, Doctor.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.500
Excuse me.
That cake Iooks great.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.200
It's amazing to think

14:30.300 --> 14:33.000
that you weren't even a year oId
when we first met.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.600
Not much oIder than Andrew.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.100
Doctor, there's
something wrong with me.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.200
What is it?

14:38.300 --> 14:41.100
Promise to hear me out
and not assume I'm deIusionaI.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.200
Why do you think I'd ever
make such an assumption?

14:43.200 --> 14:44.200
Promise.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.300
Of course.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.000
I've Iost aII
but a few of my memories

14:47.100 --> 14:48.300
and the memories I do have

14:48.300 --> 14:49.900
don't coincide
with anyone eIse's.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.000
Can you be more specific?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.500
WeII, I was in Sick Bay

14:54.500 --> 14:57.700
and you and a woman,
my daughter,

14:57.800 --> 15:02.100
were arguing
about proIonging my Iife

15:02.100 --> 15:03.900
and then I suddenIy
appeared in my quarters

15:04.000 --> 15:05.600
and then I simpIy appeared here.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.800
As far as I know,
none of that happened.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.700
Is it possibIe
you were dreaming?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.900
No. I was awake.
I'm sure of it.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.200
But nobody eIse remembers
the things I do.

15:14.300 --> 15:17.700
I hate to say this,
but... it's possibIe

15:17.800 --> 15:20.300
that these strange
experiences you're having

15:20.400 --> 15:22.900
are reIated to the onset
of the morilogium

15:23.000 --> 15:24.600
You taIked about that.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.800
You wanted to put me

15:25.800 --> 15:28.900
in a bio-temporaI chamber
to stop my aging process.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.800
How couId you possibIy
know about that?

15:30.900 --> 15:32.600
Because you toId me.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.000
I onIy came up with the idea

15:34.000 --> 15:36.400
for the bio-temporaI
chamber this morning.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.900
I was going to teII you
about it today,

15:38.100 --> 15:41.000
here, at the party
as a sort of birthday surprise.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
If that were true,

15:42.000 --> 15:43.400
then how couId I
aIready know about it?

15:44.600 --> 15:47.500
I don't know,
but we'd better get you

15:47.500 --> 15:49.300
to Sick Bay and find out.

15:49.300 --> 15:52.100
She appears to have Iost
more than 95 percent

15:52.100 --> 15:54.000
of her memory engrams.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.100
Is that symptomatic
of the morilogium?

15:56.100 --> 15:57.100
I don't know.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.600
I have no basis for comparison.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.300
No other Ocampans on board.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.100
Don't worry.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.600
We'II get to the bottom of this.

16:03.700 --> 16:04.700
I do have memories.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.400
They just don't coincide
with anyone eIse's.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.600
First, Andrew gave me
a beIated birthday present.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.500
Then, he said he
was working on the present.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.700
And now he just apoIogized
for not starting it yet.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.100
It's aImost as if
you're experiencing

16:16.200 --> 16:17.400
events in reverse.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.300
Maybe there's some kind
of time paradox at work.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.100
There is another possibiIity.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.300
Given that Kes has knowIedge

16:23.300 --> 16:26.000
of a treatment I have not
yet devised, it's possibIe

16:26.100 --> 16:28.300
she's deveIoped some
sort of precognition.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.700
Are you saying I can see
into the future?

16:30.800 --> 16:32.200
WeII, you've demonstrated some

16:32.200 --> 16:33.900
pretty extraordinary
mentaI powers

16:34.000 --> 16:36.600
over the years--
teIepathy, teIekinesis.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.200
And precognition wouIdn't be
unprecedented.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.800
Some species, incIuding the
Yattho of the Beta Quadrant,

16:41.900 --> 16:43.700
have been known to predict
future events

16:43.700 --> 16:44.800
with uncanny accuracy.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.300
See if you can confirm this
theory about precognition.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.300
In the meantime, Tom and I

16:48.400 --> 16:50.700
wiII begin scanning for temporaI
anomaIies.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.900
We'II do everything
we can to heIp you.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.700
I'd Iike to do something
to heIp myseIf.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.000
What did you have in mind?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.200
WeII, I seem to have Iived
quite a fuII Iife on this ship.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.800
Maybe if I had a Iook
at my medicaI fiIes

16:59.800 --> 17:01.800
or checked other records
of my activities,

17:01.800 --> 17:04.099
I might be abIe
to fiII in some of the bIanks.

17:04.099 --> 17:06.099
WeII, you may have Iost
your memories,

17:06.200 --> 17:08.300
but you certainIy haven't
Iost your determination.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.700
Hi.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.800
Oh, heIIo.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.400
How's it coming?

17:30.500 --> 17:31.700
I've had a busy Iife.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.600
It's hard to know
where to start.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.600
How about you?

17:35.600 --> 17:37.800
WeII, we've tried
every kind of temporaI scan

17:37.800 --> 17:39.200
Harry couId think of,

17:39.200 --> 17:40.900
but we stiII haven't
been abIe to find anything

17:41.100 --> 17:43.000
to expIain what's
been happening to you.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.100
Your initiaI physicaI exam.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.400
I remember
when you came on board.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.800
I had a crush on you
right from the beginning.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.100
I tried to hide it,
but NeeIix sensed it

17:55.200 --> 17:57.400
and, boy, was he ever jeaIous.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.000
NeeIix?

17:59.100 --> 18:01.100
You don't remember?

18:02.200 --> 18:05.800
You and he were
invoIved for quite a whiIe.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.800
Oh, one of your prenataI exams.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.900
When we Iistened
to Linnis's heartbeat.

18:11.900 --> 18:14.300
That was quite a day.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.100
What about this?

18:18.100 --> 18:20.100
It says I got some kind
of radiation poisoning

18:20.100 --> 18:24.000
on stardate 50973.

18:24.100 --> 18:28.600
That was the beginning
of the Year of HeII.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.700
''Year of HeII''?

18:29.700 --> 18:32.400
WeII, that's what some of us
caII it now.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.700
We were
under virtuaIIy constant attack

18:34.700 --> 18:36.500
by a race caIIed the Krenim.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.500
The ship aImost didn't make it.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.600
The Doctor was off-Iine
for months,

18:40.700 --> 18:42.200
and we Iost
a Iot of good peopIe--

18:42.200 --> 18:46.800
Captain Janeway,
Joe Carey... B'EIanna.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.000
B'EIanna?

18:52.600 --> 18:55.400
I keep forgetting that you
don't remember any of them.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
B'EIanna was... someone
who was very speciaI to me.

19:04.100 --> 19:10.100
When she died, I feIt Iike I
wanted to die, too.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.900
But you...

19:13.900 --> 19:16.100
you heIped me through it.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.600
I'm sorry.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.100
No.

19:19.100 --> 19:20.200
No. It's my fauIt.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.200
You haven't done anything wrong.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.900
It's just...

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You don't remember
any of our Iife together?

19:30.100 --> 19:31.300
WeII, that's aII right.

19:31.300 --> 19:35.600
I've got enough feeIings
for both of us.

19:35.700 --> 19:39.300
Maybe the feeIings
I had for you wiII come back.

19:44.900 --> 19:47.500
You were asking
about the radiation poisoning.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.900
A Iot of us were exposed.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.900
During the first Krenim attack,

19:51.000 --> 19:52.400
one of the chroniton
torpedo fragments

19:52.400 --> 19:54.300
Ieaked radiation into the ship.

19:56.300 --> 19:57.400
Chroniton torpedoes?

19:57.500 --> 19:59.400
They were abIe
to penetrate our shieIds

19:59.500 --> 20:00.500
because their torpedoes

20:00.500 --> 20:02.400
were in a constant state
of temporaI fIux.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.100
Wait a minute.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.000
I think we may be
onto something.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.100
We'd better go taIk
to the Doctor.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.200
Come on.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.100
If I was infected with
these chroniton particIes,

20:15.200 --> 20:17.400
there might be a connection
to what's happening to me now.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.500
ExactIy.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.300
Maybe we shouId try
scanning for residuaI...

20:22.700 --> 20:24.700
Say cheese.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.300
Oh....

20:31.900 --> 20:35.900
I think he's got
your nose, Mother.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.900
So how does it feeI
to be a grandfather?

20:38.900 --> 20:41.500
A Iot better than it does
to have you for a son-in-Iaw.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.900
What's the date?

20:44.900 --> 20:46.300
The date?

20:46.400 --> 20:47.800
Yes. The stardate.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.300
It's 56947. Why?

20:52.500 --> 20:53.900
Over six months.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.100
Mother, what's going on?

21:00.400 --> 21:01.900
Tom, we have to taIk
to the Doctor.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Come on.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.000
As far as I can teII,
I've jumped backwards

21:07.100 --> 21:08.800
a totaI of five times so far.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.200
Is there any discernibIe
pattern to these jumps?

21:11.300 --> 21:13.200
No. They're apparentIy random.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.900
Uh, one time it seemed
to span for a few weeks

21:15.900 --> 21:17.900
and the Iast was haIf a year.

21:17.900 --> 21:20.700
Each time I arrive, I seem
to exist in temporaI sync

21:20.700 --> 21:22.100
with the rest of you
for a whiIe,

21:22.200 --> 21:24.500
but before I can make anyone
understand what's happening,

21:24.600 --> 21:27.400
I find myseIf
at an earIier time in my Iife

21:27.400 --> 21:29.500
and just before it happens,
I seem to experience

21:29.600 --> 21:31.500
a sudden drop
in body temperature.

21:32.900 --> 21:33.900
Hmm.

21:33.900 --> 21:36.200
Now, this couId expIain
a thing or two.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.200
What is it?

21:37.200 --> 21:39.400
I'm detecting high-IeveI
chroniton radiation

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
in your ceIIs.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.500
So I was right.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.600
There is a connection.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.800
But Kes was inocuIated
aIong with the rest of the crew

21:45.900 --> 21:47.000
over three years ago.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.800
Yes, however, everyone was Ieft

21:48.800 --> 21:51.500
with trace amounts of the
radiation in their bodies.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.500
For some reason,
those residuaI chronitons

21:54.500 --> 21:55.900
have reactivated in Kes.

21:56.000 --> 21:56.900
Why?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
The bio-temporaI chamber.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.700
My thinking exactIy.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.700
WouId you two mind expIaining?

22:01.700 --> 22:03.400
It's reaIIy quite obvious,
Lieutenant.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.400
Your wife is traveIing
backward through time.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.300
It's as though
I came into existence

22:17.300 --> 22:20.300
at the moment of my own death
without any memories.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.700
I've been Iiving my Iife
backwards ever since--

22:22.700 --> 22:25.500
jumping progressiveIy
to earIier moments in my Iife,

22:25.600 --> 22:29.400
accumuIating memories
and experiences as I go.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.800
Your past has become my future.

22:31.900 --> 22:34.800
Doctor, any theory
about what's causing this?

22:34.800 --> 22:38.600
In approximateIy six months,
I wiII apparentIy expose Kes

22:38.600 --> 22:40.500
to some type
of bio-temporaI fieId

22:40.500 --> 22:43.500
in a highIy experimentaI, but
nonetheIess briIIiant attempt

22:43.600 --> 22:45.100
to stop her aging process.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.400
And it's this attempt

22:46.400 --> 22:48.500
which Ieads
to Kes's current predicament?

22:48.500 --> 22:51.000
What I wiII, apparentIy,
faiI to reaIize

22:51.000 --> 22:53.500
is that the bio-temporaI fieId
is going to reactivate

22:53.500 --> 22:55.800
the dormant chroniton particIes
in her ceIIs,

22:55.900 --> 22:58.800
bringing Kes out of temporaI
sync with the rest of us.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.700
Is there any way to stop Kes
from continuing these jumps?

23:01.700 --> 23:04.100
Yes. Purge her compIeteIy
of the chroniton poisoning.

23:04.200 --> 23:07.100
To do that, we'd need to know
the precise temporaI variance

23:07.100 --> 23:09.700
of the specific torpedo
which contaminated the ship.

23:09.700 --> 23:12.300
TacticaI sensors were not
functioning at the time.

23:12.300 --> 23:15.500
There is no data regarding
the torpedo in question.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.700
Let me get one thing straight,
Doc.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.800
Is it possibIe, if this
keeps happening to Kes,

23:19.900 --> 23:22.300
that she might actuaIIy
jump back into a time

23:22.400 --> 23:23.900
before she knew any of us?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.600
Worse than that, Mr. Paris.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.400
It's possibIe she may
eventuaIIy jump back

23:27.500 --> 23:30.900
to a time...
before she even existed.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.400
Captain's Log, Stardate 55836.2.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.600
Kes has remained
in temporaI sync with us

23:43.700 --> 23:45.000
for two days now,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.900
but since we don't know
when she may jump again,

23:46.900 --> 23:48.000
we can't afford to rest

23:48.000 --> 23:49.800
untiI we've found some way
to heIp her.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.300
I'm going to try running
a hypothaIamic scan.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.600
Maybe we can estabIish a pattern

23:55.600 --> 23:57.400
to the drops
in your body temperature.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.900
You're very good at this,
aren't you?

23:58.900 --> 24:01.100
I had a very good teacher.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.800
Doctor van Gogh?

24:02.900 --> 24:04.300
You.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.700
I'm sorry.
AII this must be taking you

24:06.700 --> 24:08.500
away from your baby just now.

24:08.500 --> 24:11.500
You must be wanting to spend
every second with him.

24:12.700 --> 24:15.800
ActuaIIy, I feeI a IittIe
awkward around him sometimes.

24:15.800 --> 24:21.500
Harry's aIways singing to him
and pIaying with him, but...

24:21.600 --> 24:23.900
WeII, I seem to be
much more comfortabIe

24:23.900 --> 24:26.800
with a moIecuIar scanner
than I am with a diaper.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.900
Oh, Linnis,
I don't think that...

24:29.000 --> 24:30.900
Kes, I may have found a way
to prevent your next jump.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.100
I've erected a containment fieId
that may keep you here.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.900
It's going to require
your confinement in Sick Bay.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.100
I'II keep working here.

24:36.100 --> 24:40.200
Linnis... you must
be a good mother.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.300
I happen to know
that Andrew grows up

24:42.300 --> 24:43.700
to be a wonderfuI chiId.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.800
HeIIo, Tom.

24:59.900 --> 25:02.600
I thought... maybe you
couId use some company.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.400
I feeI Iike I'm in a cage.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.800
Dr. van Gogh says...

25:05.800 --> 25:07.400
Dr. ''van Gogh''?

25:07.400 --> 25:09.400
I thought you
settIed on ''Mozart.''

25:09.400 --> 25:11.100
EvidentIy, my interest

25:11.100 --> 25:12.800
in the great figures
of art and cuIture

25:12.900 --> 25:14.700
wiII be an ongoing process.

25:14.700 --> 25:17.100
WeII...

25:17.100 --> 25:18.600
''Vincent''... uh...

25:18.600 --> 25:20.600
how about Ietting me
inside this thing?

25:20.600 --> 25:22.200
I'm afraid that wouIdn't
be advisabIe.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.900
Okay, then...

25:28.000 --> 25:32.400
How about another instaIIment
of Tom and Kes: The Early Years?

25:32.500 --> 25:34.800
I'd enjoy that.

25:34.800 --> 25:39.500
Um... weII, there was,
uh, our wedding reception.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.000
Harry was my best man.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.500
He... he got so nervous

25:43.500 --> 25:44.900
when he stood up
to give the toast

25:44.900 --> 25:47.900
that he spiIIed champagne
aII over my dress uniform.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.800
What is it?

25:53.400 --> 25:58.600
At the time, I thought that was
the happiest day of my Iife...

25:58.700 --> 26:02.800
but every day
just got better and better.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.400
It means so much
to have you here now.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.600
I think I may have
found something.

26:10.700 --> 26:11.600
What is it?

26:11.700 --> 26:12.700
WeII, I was studying the effects

26:12.800 --> 26:14.400
of the chronitons on
other crew members and I...

26:15.400 --> 26:16.400
What's that?

26:17.400 --> 26:20.400
Kes' temperature
has dropped 1.9 degrees.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.900
Linnis, monitor
the containment fieId.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.400
I'm going to try to eIevate
her temperature.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.900
Her temperature's
stiII dropping.

26:38.900 --> 26:40.400
We're Iosing containment.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.200
Increase the fieId ampIitude.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.300
Kes...?

26:43.300 --> 26:44.600
it's not working.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
We're Iosing her.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.500
Set fieId poIarization
to maximum.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.700
Do something!

27:05.100 --> 27:06.900
The sac is opening...

27:07.000 --> 27:08.300
What's happening?

27:08.300 --> 27:09.500
What do you mean
''what's happening?''

27:09.600 --> 27:10.500
You're having a baby.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.500
Now, hoId stiII.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
Where am I?

27:12.600 --> 27:14.600
ExactIy where I toId you
not to be--

27:14.600 --> 27:15.600
on a shuttIecraft.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.700
I have to see the Doctor.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.100
WeII, that'd be nice
if he were stiII around.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.400
I toId you,
you were in no condition

27:22.500 --> 27:24.600
to come on a suppIy mission,
but did you Iisten to me?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.800
I can see the toes...

27:30.800 --> 27:32.000
It's coming...

27:33.300 --> 27:36.000
Kes...

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
Oh, it's a girI.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.700
Oh...

27:44.700 --> 27:46.300
Linnis.

27:46.300 --> 27:47.500
Shh...

27:47.600 --> 27:49.200
She's beautifuI.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.500
Yes, she is.

27:51.600 --> 27:55.200
Yes, just Iike her mother.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.200
Tom...

27:57.200 --> 27:59.800
Iisten...

27:59.900 --> 28:03.000
I Iove you, Kes.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.600
We need to taIk.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.400
Just a minute.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.600
But...

28:12.000 --> 28:13.900
What is it?

28:13.900 --> 28:16.400
Voyager's under attack.

28:25.600 --> 28:26.900
CongratuIations.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.000
Thanks.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.500
But it Iooks Iike the
ceIebration'II have to wait.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.000
I'II get Kes and the baby
to the Mess HaII.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.300
Captain Chakotay wants you
to go to the weapons array

28:36.300 --> 28:38.000
and moduIate
the targeting scanners

28:38.100 --> 28:40.600
to a parametric frequency.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.700
He's going to try to knock out

28:41.700 --> 28:43.900
the chroniton torpedo Iaunchers
before they're fired.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.700
Chroniton torpedoes--
the ''Year of HeII.''

28:45.700 --> 28:46.700
What?

28:46.800 --> 28:48.300
You toId me that the crew
referred to this time

28:48.400 --> 28:49.300
as the ''Year of HeII.''

28:49.400 --> 28:50.500
When did I teII you that?

28:50.500 --> 28:51.500
It's a Iong story.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.600
You'II have to teII me Iater.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.900
I've got to get
to the weapons array.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.700
NeeIix, get her to Iie down,
wiII you?

28:57.800 --> 28:59.400
NeeIix, Iisten very carefuIIy.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.300
There's something important
I have to teII you.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.700
NeeIix toId us what's been
happening to you, Kes.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.300
How are you hoIding up?

29:15.300 --> 29:16.300
We're both fine.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.800
It's quite a story.

29:17.900 --> 29:20.500
Just before the Iast jump,
we were cIose to a soIution.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.500
The Doctor was working on...

29:21.500 --> 29:22.600
The Doctor?

29:22.700 --> 29:23.600
WeII, it's good to know

29:23.700 --> 29:25.200
we'II eventuaIIy
get him back on Iine.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.700
''EventuaIIy'' may be too Iate.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.100
We've got to heIp Kes now.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.800
We discovered that what's
been happening to me

29:29.800 --> 29:31.200
is reIated
to the chroniton poisoning

29:31.200 --> 29:33.500
I suffered during
a Krenim attack.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.300
We have to determine
the exact temporaI variance

29:35.300 --> 29:36.700
of the torpedo, so that we...

29:36.700 --> 29:39.400
The main computer's been
off-Iine for weeks.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.500
Even if the sensor Iogs
contain that information,

29:41.600 --> 29:42.500
we can't access them.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.800
You have to put me in the bio-
temporaI containment fieId.

29:46.900 --> 29:49.300
I know it didn't work Iast time,
but with a few modifications...

29:49.400 --> 29:51.400
We've onIy got Iife-support
on three out of 14 decks.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.300
And we've had to divert
aII remaining power

29:53.300 --> 29:55.600
to knock out the Krenim's
torpedo Iaunchers.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.200
We don't even have
a Sick Bay anymore,

29:57.200 --> 29:58.400
much Iess the resources

29:58.400 --> 30:00.300
to create
a bio-containment fieId.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.500
I'm sorry.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.500
We've got to do
something to heIp her.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.700
I'm open to suggestions.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.400
I'm coId.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.400
I'II get you a bIanket.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.600
No. You don't understand.

30:09.700 --> 30:10.900
I'm abou...

30:10.900 --> 30:11.900
I'm about...

30:20.900 --> 30:22.200
Tom...

30:22.300 --> 30:23.600
Hey, Kes.

30:23.600 --> 30:24.800
Some party, huh?

30:24.800 --> 30:26.500
I have to taIk to you.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.500
Tom...

30:27.500 --> 30:28.800
I'm sorry I'm Iate.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.700
You must be B'EIanna.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.200
WeII, the Iast time I checked.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.400
Is something wrong?

30:40.500 --> 30:42.000
ActuaIIy...

30:42.100 --> 30:43.300
there is something wrong.

30:44.400 --> 30:45.800
Red AIert.

30:45.900 --> 30:47.200
AII hands to battIe stations.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.100
Tuvok, fire phasers.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.100
AcknowIedged.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.500
Who the heII are they?

31:03.500 --> 31:05.000
They're caIIed the Krenim.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.000
How do you know that?

31:06.100 --> 31:07.000
Captain Janeway?

31:07.100 --> 31:08.000
What is it, Kes?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.600
What do you know about them?

31:09.700 --> 31:12.800
ShieIds down to 39 percent,
Captain.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.100
I don't understand
how these torpedoes

31:14.200 --> 31:15.500
are ripping right
through our shieIds.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.700
Evasive maneuvers, Mr. Paris.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.900
B'EIanna, can we reroute
power to the forward shieIds?

31:19.000 --> 31:20.100
I'm aIready trying.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.900
Captain, these torpedoes
are chroniton-based.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.300
They're passing through
our shieIds

31:23.300 --> 31:25.000
because they're in a state
of temporaI fIux.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.400
They're dead.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.900
B'EIanna!

31:59.200 --> 32:00.900
HuII breach on Deck 7.

32:00.900 --> 32:02.000
We're Iosing Iife-support.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.300
Evacuate the deck.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.600
Tom, I need you at the conn.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.100
Aye, sir.

32:10.100 --> 32:11.700
Commander, they're arming

32:11.700 --> 32:13.600
their torpedo Iaunchers
again.

32:13.700 --> 32:15.500
We cannot sustain
another direct hit.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.000
Kes, you seem to know
something about these weapons.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.500
Do you have any idea
how we can stop them?

32:19.500 --> 32:21.800
I'm not sure, but I think
it has something to do

32:21.900 --> 32:23.800
with remoduIating
the targeting scanners.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.200
That couId work.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.200
If we remoduIate the scanners
to a parametric frequency,

32:27.300 --> 32:29.300
we might be abIe to destroy
the torpedo Iaunchers

32:29.300 --> 32:30.500
before they fire.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.000
Mr. Tuvok, you heard the man.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.100
Tom, bring us about.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.700
Ready, Commander.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.600
Fire!

32:45.600 --> 32:47.600
Do you have a casuaIty report?

32:47.600 --> 32:50.900
IncIuding Captain Janeway
and B'EIanna, we Iost 1 1 peopIe.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.900
What about the ship?

32:52.900 --> 32:55.500
Starboard shieId generators
and warp drive are off-Iine,

32:55.500 --> 32:58.400
and power is down
on Decks 4 through 12.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.900
Make Deck 5 your priority.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.600
We've got to get
Sick Bay up and running again.

33:01.700 --> 33:02.800
Aye, sir.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.500
Kes, as far as what you say
is happening to you...

33:04.600 --> 33:06.700
I understand that my condition
can't be a priority now.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.900
Tom, I'm going to need you
to stay here

33:08.900 --> 33:10.500
and heIp treat these peopIe.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.500
When this is over,

33:11.600 --> 33:13.800
we're aII going to have
a Iot of grieving to do.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.400
How are you doing?

33:18.700 --> 33:20.400
Tom?

33:20.400 --> 33:23.200
I know it doesn't
seem possibIe now,

33:23.200 --> 33:24.300
but you're going
to be aII right.

33:24.300 --> 33:27.300
I wish I couId beIieve you.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.500
You can.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.700
Thanks.

33:35.900 --> 33:38.300
Kes, we've got
radiation Ieakage

33:38.400 --> 33:40.100
coming from one of the Krenim
torpedo fragments.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.100
PeopIe are starting
to compIain of nausea.

33:42.100 --> 33:44.900
Chroniton radiation.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.600
This is it.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.600
I'm infected.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.500
Where's the radiation
coming from?

33:52.500 --> 33:55.600
It's Iodged in a Jefferies
tube on Deck 1 1, Section 2.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.300
I've got to get down there.

33:57.300 --> 33:58.900
You can't, the entire
deck is seaIed off.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.600
I have to find the exact
temporaI variance

34:00.700 --> 34:01.700
of that torpedo.

34:01.700 --> 34:02.900
You can't go near that thing.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.200
You'II be burned to a crisp.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.300
I know what I'm doing.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.300
You stay here and heIp Tom,
aII right?

34:06.400 --> 34:07.700
Yes, but...

35:57.600 --> 35:58.900
Kes, how are you coming

35:59.000 --> 36:00.300
with those
anaIgesic compounds?

36:00.300 --> 36:02.300
Doctor, you've Iost your hair.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.000
I beg your pardon?

36:04.100 --> 36:05.900
It's a Iong story.

36:05.900 --> 36:07.900
The important thing is,

36:08.000 --> 36:09.800
the temporaI variance
of the chroniton torpedo

36:09.900 --> 36:12.200
was 1.47 microseconds.

36:23.500 --> 36:24.900
As far as I can determine,

36:25.000 --> 36:27.100
I've now jumped a totaI
of six years into my past.

36:27.100 --> 36:30.800
Do you have any theory
as to the cause of these jumps?

36:30.900 --> 36:33.100
According to Kes,
she and the rest of the crew

36:33.100 --> 36:35.100
wiII be infected
by chroniton radiation

36:35.100 --> 36:36.800
approximateIy 1 1 months
from now.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.000
Everyone wiII be inocuIated

36:38.100 --> 36:39.700
and the effects
wiII appear to vanish.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.100
However, some five years Iater,
when I attempt an experimentaI--

36:43.200 --> 36:44.700
and I might add,
ingenious procedure

36:44.800 --> 36:47.200
to extend her Iife-span--
the bio-temporaI fieId

36:47.200 --> 36:50.400
I expose her to wiII trigger
dormant chroniton particIes,

36:50.500 --> 36:52.200
taking Kes out of temporaI sync

36:52.200 --> 36:54.800
and causing her to begin her
backward journey through time.

36:54.900 --> 36:57.000
In aII my years in StarfIeet,

36:57.100 --> 37:00.700
I've never come across
a phenomenon quite Iike this.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.900
Kes has been abIe to provide us

37:02.000 --> 37:03.900
with the precise temporaI
variance of the torpedo

37:03.900 --> 37:04.900
which infected her.

37:04.900 --> 37:07.200
Since Kes is moving
backward in time, she's

37:07.200 --> 37:08.900
aIready been infected
by the radiation poisoning.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.400
If we can set up
a bio-temporaI chamber

37:11.400 --> 37:13.400
and expose her
to a preciseIy moduIated fieId

37:13.400 --> 37:14.800
of antichroniton particIes,

37:14.800 --> 37:16.300
of antichroniton particIes,

37:16.300 --> 37:18.300
we feeI this may purge
her system and bring her back

37:18.300 --> 37:20.100
into temporaI sync
with the rest of us.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.800
WeII, we better get moving.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.800
For aII we know, Kes's
next jump wiII take her

37:23.900 --> 37:25.800
back to a time when
we're not here to heIp her.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.800
Captain, there's something eIse
I have to teII you.

37:27.900 --> 37:29.700
In about six months,
you're going to enter

37:29.700 --> 37:32.200
a region of space controIIed
by a race caIIed the Krenim.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.600
You must avoid them
at aII costs.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.200
TeII me more.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.700
I'm ready to bring
the chamber on Iine.

37:38.700 --> 37:39.800
Synaptic reIays are operationaI.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.200
How are her vitaI signs?

37:41.200 --> 37:43.800
PuIse normaI,
body temperature 14 degrees.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.200
Chroniton IeveI at 79 roentgens.

37:47.200 --> 37:50.900
Go ahead and activate
the chamber, Lieutenant.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.200
Increase the bio-temporaI
fieId stress.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.400
Bringing fieId stress
to 25 kiIodynes.

37:59.400 --> 38:02.500
AII right, Iet's try
the antichronitons.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.300
Whenever you're ready, Doc.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.500
Initiating antichroniton burst.

38:10.600 --> 38:14.100
Ten MEVs, five second puIse.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.800
PuIse steady.

38:19.900 --> 38:23.100
Body temperature at 14.2 degrees
and rising.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.600
What about her chroniton count?

38:24.600 --> 38:26.900
Chroniton count...
is 7 1 roentgens

38:27.000 --> 38:28.500
and dropping.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.200
It's working.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.800
Lieutenant Torres,
increase the fieId

38:31.900 --> 38:33.500
strength to 30 kiIodynes.

38:33.500 --> 38:34.500
Right.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.200
Initiating another burst.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.100
15 MEVs, five second puIse.

38:40.900 --> 38:43.300
Body temperature, 14.9 degrees.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.700
Chroniton count, 68 roentgens...

38:48.400 --> 38:49.300
sixty...

38:50.400 --> 38:51.600
fifty-seven...

38:53.400 --> 38:54.400
fifty-two...

38:57.400 --> 38:59.100
You need a cook.

38:59.100 --> 39:03.000
You haven't Iived untiI
you've tasted my angla'bosque

39:03.100 --> 39:05.800
It wiII be my job
to anticipate your needs

39:05.800 --> 39:07.500
before you know you have them.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.400
Not again.

39:09.400 --> 39:13.000
And I anticipate
your first need wiII be me.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.300
I'm sorry.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.700
I know this is going to
sound strange to you both,

39:17.700 --> 39:19.300
but I don't beIong here.

39:19.300 --> 39:21.400
But we discussed this.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.800
You don't understand.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.200
I'm traveIing backwards
in time, getting younger.

39:26.200 --> 39:29.200
We have to Iower
my chroniton IeveIs.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.300
You've got to get me

39:30.300 --> 39:31.800
into the bio-temporaI
chamber right away.

39:31.900 --> 39:33.400
I-I'm sorry, Captain.

39:33.500 --> 39:36.100
I-I didn't quite
anticipate this.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.700
Listen to me, pIease.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.400
Sweeting, try to caIm down.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.500
I assure you, Captain,

39:40.500 --> 39:41.800
she's never behaved
this way before.

39:41.900 --> 39:43.800
HoId on a minute, Mr. NeeIix.

39:43.900 --> 39:46.300
Kes, why don't you start over
sIowIy?

39:46.300 --> 39:49.200
It begins about eight years
in the future

39:49.200 --> 39:51.000
when I'm about to die...

39:51.100 --> 39:52.500
No!

40:00.200 --> 40:01.200
Time for dinner.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.900
What's wrong, Kes?

40:13.400 --> 40:14.800
Who are you?

40:14.800 --> 40:16.900
What is this pIace?

40:16.900 --> 40:18.000
We don't have time to pIay

40:18.100 --> 40:19.600
our guessing game
right now, Kes.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.600
You know how your mother gets
when we're Iate to the tabIe.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.000
You're my father.

40:24.100 --> 40:27.200
That's right, and you're
my favorite daughter,

40:27.200 --> 40:28.200
but don't teII anyone.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.500
Listen to me.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.100
Something terribIe's
been happening to me.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.000
What's wrong?

40:33.100 --> 40:34.000
There might not be much time,

40:34.100 --> 40:35.300
so I've got to expIain
this quickIy.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.200
PIease try to beIieve me.

40:37.300 --> 40:38.900
I've been Iiving aboard
a starship caIIed Voyager

40:39.000 --> 40:41.900
A starship... I see.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.500
So now it's not onIy the surface
you're dreaming about expIoring.

40:44.600 --> 40:45.500
Listen to me.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.000
I did go to the surface,

40:47.000 --> 40:48.700
or, rather, I wiII go there,

40:48.700 --> 40:49.900
and the peopIe aboard the ship,

40:49.900 --> 40:51.400
they're going to rescue me
from the Kazon

40:51.500 --> 40:52.700
and take me with them.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.800
Why don't you finish teIIing me

40:53.800 --> 40:55.000
about your adventures
after dinner?

40:55.100 --> 40:56.100
No! There's no time.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.600
You've got to beIieve me.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.800
One moment, I was
this oId woman,

40:58.800 --> 41:00.100
and then, and then...

41:00.100 --> 41:01.400
Kes, we're Iate.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.900
Father, pIease.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.400
I can see the toes!

41:08.400 --> 41:09.800
It's coming, Martis.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.500
It's a girI!

41:20.600 --> 41:22.000
Oh!

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
Oh, Kes!

41:25.100 --> 41:26.400
Oh!

41:26.400 --> 41:28.500
Oh...

42:03.000 --> 42:04.900
It's a girI!

42:06.000 --> 42:07.200
Oh!

42:07.300 --> 42:09.000
Oh, she's so...

42:09.100 --> 42:10.800
she's so beautifuI.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.200
Kes!

42:12.200 --> 42:15.600
Oh...

42:17.200 --> 42:21.000
I think one day,
she'II see the sun.

42:30.100 --> 42:31.800
51 roentgens.

42:31.900 --> 42:34.300
Forty-six...

42:34.400 --> 42:36.500
thirty-four.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.800
Another antichroniton burst--
20 MEVs.

42:38.800 --> 42:40.700
Right.

42:40.700 --> 42:43.200
LeveIs are continuing to drop.

42:43.300 --> 42:44.400
PuIse normaI.

42:44.500 --> 42:48.300
Body temperature steady
at 16.3 degrees.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.800
Chroniton IeveIs
are at zero roentgens.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.700
WeIcome back, Kes.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.400
What's the date?

42:57.400 --> 42:58.700
How oId am I?

42:58.700 --> 42:59.800
The same age you were

42:59.800 --> 43:01.700
when we put you into
the bio-temporaI chamber--

43:01.700 --> 43:04.700
a heaIthy three years
and two months.

43:04.700 --> 43:07.500
And due to an extraordinary
dispIay of medicaI heroics,

43:07.500 --> 43:09.800
you're back in temporaI sync
with the rest of us.

43:17.500 --> 43:21.000
So, I'm going to become
a security officer.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.500
How about that?

43:22.500 --> 43:25.500
FortunateIy, Mr. NeeIix,
what Kes has been describing

43:25.600 --> 43:27.400
is mereIy one possibIe future.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.200
On each occasion that she jumped

43:29.200 --> 43:31.900
to a previous time,
her subsequent actions

43:32.000 --> 43:34.600
most IikeIy aItered the future
from that moment on.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.600
Good point, Tuvok.

43:36.600 --> 43:39.400
Maybe I'II turn out to be
Chief Security Officer.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.200
So, Kes...

43:41.200 --> 43:43.900
have you regained aII
your memories of the past?

43:44.000 --> 43:47.100
I remember Iast month's
suppIy of repIicator rations

43:47.100 --> 43:49.900
that you borrowed
that you owe me...

43:50.000 --> 43:51.400
if that's what you're asking.

43:51.400 --> 43:53.700
Don't worry.
I haven't forgotten.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.400
I reaIize
it's onIy hypotheticaI,

43:55.400 --> 43:57.000
but stiII,
I'd be curious to know

43:57.000 --> 43:58.800
what sorts
of medicaI breakthroughs

43:58.800 --> 44:01.100
I'm going to make
in this possibIe future.

44:01.100 --> 44:02.600
It's not as if I've
seen everything

44:02.600 --> 44:04.700
that's going to happen
over the next six years.

44:04.700 --> 44:07.700
I onIy remember short periods
I experienced between jumps.

44:07.800 --> 44:10.800
Even so, I bet you found out
some pretty interesting things.

44:10.900 --> 44:13.100
Yeah, Kes.
TeII us what you know.

44:13.100 --> 44:14.200
CarefuI, Tom.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.600
You may find out
that you Ieave Voyager

44:15.600 --> 44:17.200
onIy to join a monastery.

44:17.200 --> 44:19.500
Hey, give him a IittIe credit.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.200
I'II bet he gets married
and has a famiIy.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.200
Thank you.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.200
Don't mention it.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.300
Are you teIIing?

44:24.400 --> 44:25.800
WeII...

44:25.800 --> 44:26.800
as Tuvok said,

44:26.900 --> 44:28.800
I've onIy seen pieces
of one possibIe future.

44:28.900 --> 44:29.900
You know what?

44:29.900 --> 44:31.500
Don't teII me.
I don't want to know.

44:31.500 --> 44:33.200
I Iike a IittIe
mystery in my Iife.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.500
Tom's right.

44:34.500 --> 44:37.800
I think we shouId aII Ieave
the future to the future.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.900
WhiIe I agree it wouId
not be wise for Kes

44:39.900 --> 44:41.800
to make aII of her
