Malcolm helped his ex Diandra
get the closer she needed

00:09.743 --> 00:12.145
and his former love interest
Maya continued to get

00:12.212 --> 00:15.081
territorial about Diandra
being in the house.

00:15.148 --> 00:17.951
{\an5}So, what do
you want, though?

00:15.148 --> 00:17.951
{\an1}Didi gone.

between the guy she wants

00:21.354 --> 00:23.890

Oh, my God.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.359
{\an5}(narrator)
And at elimination,
Farrah convinced

00:26.426 --> 00:30.563
enough of her fellow singles
to give her ex Simon the boot.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.899
You are no longer
an ex on the beach.

00:32.966 --> 00:36.469

And tonight, Malcolm's ex
Diandra and a new ex

00:36.536 --> 00:39.305
clap back at mean girls
Maya and Janelle.

always been waiting to hear.

still has to share the house
with Malcolm's ex Diandra,

01:41.267 --> 01:45.572
{\an5}who made it through the
first elimination thanks
to Malcolm's crush vote.

{\an4}(Diandra)
If anybody has a problem
with me, that was the
time to speak up.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.244
{\an4}If anybody has a problem
with me, just tell me
to my face right now.

01:51.311 --> 01:54.113
{\an5}Just because you get cut
does not mean someone
has a problem with you.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.783
{\an8}I just feel like you
should go. That's just
me. That's my opinion.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.918
{\an4}Okay, that's fine.
I disagree with you.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.918
That is what I'm doing.

01:58.985 --> 02:01.721
If an ex comes in here
that I might be feeling,

02:01.788 --> 02:05.158
{\an5}you being here could
potentially take him
away from me.

02:05.225 --> 02:08.094
{\an8}Maya is completely burned about
me and she needs to go ahead

02:08.161 --> 02:11.831
{\an8}and cancel any pretty girl
out here so she can be
the only one to look at,

02:11.898 --> 02:13.733
but then what happens when those
guys walk through that door

02:13.800 --> 02:16.569
and they still not interested
in her? So then what?

02:16.636 --> 02:19.706
{\an5}I can lie to you and
sit here and ha-ha and
hee-hee in your face

02:19.772 --> 02:21.207
or I can tell you
what I said to everybody.

02:21.274 --> 02:23.943
This is not the environment
for her to find love.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.646
{\an5}Let's keep it 1,000.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.646
I don't give a (bleep).

02:26.713 --> 02:28.481
I really feel like Diandra
deserves to be here.

02:28.548 --> 02:31.518
{\an5}What me and Maya had
was so early, man, and
it ended so quick

02:31.584 --> 02:33.353
{\an8}that she really just making
herself look dumb.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.755
{\an5}I'm not gonna be
fake as (bleep) with
anybody in this house.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.024
{\an5}If I said it behind
your back in this tone...

02:35.822 --> 02:38.024
{\an1}Okay.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.859
I'm gonna say it in front
of your face in this tone.

02:39.926 --> 02:41.995
{\an8}Maya's just been waiting
to lash out at Diandra

02:42.061 --> 02:44.831
because she feels
threatened for no reason.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.534
I don't get it. Just shut
the (bleep) up and let it go.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.570
{\an5}So you're telling me that
you're gonna find love...

02:47.600 --> 02:50.570
{\an3}Oh, my God!

02:50.637 --> 02:52.038
{\an5}with somebody else's (bleep)...

02:50.637 --> 02:52.038
Maya, all right.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.307
...that's coming here
to work things out?

02:54.374 --> 02:57.310
{\an8}A lot of people in the
house may think that
I'm intimidated by Didi

02:57.377 --> 03:00.179
{\an8}and that's why I don't want her
here, but I'm sorry, Diandra.

03:00.246 --> 03:03.149
{\an8}You can't compare yourself,
a Honda, to a "Royce Royce."

03:03.216 --> 03:07.253
{\an5}(narrator)
Uh, Maya, I think
you mean "Rolls Royce."

03:03.216 --> 03:07.253
{\an3}Oh!

03:07.320 --> 03:08.788
{\an5}So you want to find love?

03:07.320 --> 03:08.788
{\an1}Yeah.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.492
With one of our exes?
Your issue on y'all season

03:12.559 --> 03:15.328
{\an5}was the fact that you
felt like you came second.

03:12.559 --> 03:15.328
Oh, really?

03:15.395 --> 03:19.365
{\an4}So if somebody comes in here,
you're going to come second.
I'm doing you a favor.

03:19.432 --> 03:23.469
{\an8}(laughs)

03:23.536 --> 03:27.040
{\an5}You want to repeat the cycle,
repeat the cycle, bitch.
I'm doing you a favor.

03:27.106 --> 03:28.308
{\an5}Don't call me a bitch.
Don't call me a bitch.

03:27.106 --> 03:28.308
I'm literally...

03:28.374 --> 03:30.209

Chill the (bleep) out.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.545
{\an5}Chill the (bleep) out

03:30.276 --> 03:32.545
{\an1}Bitch!

03:32.612 --> 03:37.984
{\an4}Everybody's just in
the mood to (bleep)
argue with everybody,

03:38.051 --> 03:40.053
{\an4}and I don't want to
deal with that.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.053
{\an3}I know.

03:40.119 --> 03:45.858
{\an5}I like that I can
actually just talk to
you. It makes me happy,

03:45.925 --> 03:50.496
{\an5}where we actually just...

03:45.925 --> 03:50.496
{\an5}You're not very good
at communication, but
you're working on it.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.432
So this house is therapy.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.267
{\an5}(Cory)
Being in this house
with your ex is hard.

03:54.334 --> 03:57.437
{\an8}I think I was almost certain
I was completely over Murray.

03:57.503 --> 04:00.006
I couldn't even tell you how
many times he strayed away.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.243
{\an4}I need a real
perfect partner.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.243
{\an3}Oh.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.812
Put a cap on it.

04:05.878 --> 04:08.815
{\an8}But it's so hard. I just...
A part of me is always,

04:08.881 --> 04:12.885
{\an8}I guess always gonna care
for him and I thought
that part of me was gone.

04:12.952 --> 04:16.189
{\an4}You can come sit down,
Cheyenne, if you want to.

04:12.952 --> 04:16.189

04:16.255 --> 04:17.824
God, you two are annoying.

04:17.890 --> 04:21.260

over there like a creep.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.929
{\an5}Good morning.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.929
Huh?

04:22.996 --> 04:25.264
{\an5}I said "good morning."

04:22.996 --> 04:25.264
Hi.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.200
{\an5}(Murray)
I feel like Cheyenne's getting
a little frustrated with me

04:27.266 --> 04:29.168
{\an8}because he wants me
to show him more affection,

04:29.235 --> 04:31.070
{\an8}especially now that
Cory Z's in the house.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.906
{\an5}I want to go to bed.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.906
You want to or don't
want to go to bed?

04:33.973 --> 04:36.376
{\an6}Go to bed.

04:33.973 --> 04:36.376
{\an4}I want to.

04:33.973 --> 04:36.376
Then go to bed.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.746
{\an8}And I have feelings for Cheyenne
and I have feelings for Cory Z,

04:39.812 --> 04:41.814
which makes it
awkward as (bleep).

04:43.616 --> 04:44.717
I don't need to.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.852
You should be here
for me

04:45.918 --> 04:47.654
if you really
are here for me.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.656
{\an4}I'm not (bleep) giving
you enough attention?
What are you talking about?

04:49.722 --> 04:51.090
It's not about not
giving me attention.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.660
{\an1}I don't want to
deal with it right now.

04:53.726 --> 04:58.064
{\an5}When all of (bleep)
was blowing up and doing
this stupid (bleep),

04:58.131 --> 04:59.499
I'd rather sit here by myself
and have a (bleep) cocktail.

04:59.565 --> 05:00.833
You're not by yourself.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.735
You're with him.
I'm alone.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.103
I've been alone all night.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.873
{\an8}I, by nature, require
a lot of attention.

05:06.939 --> 05:10.043
{\an8}Murray, by nature, does not
give a lot of attention.

So sometimes that
rubs me the wrong way.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.018
We're going.

{\an8}I'm happy Morgan is going
to be out of the house

24:15.987 --> 24:18.323

Everyone else is, like, so
stressed out. I'm chillin'.

24:54.092 --> 24:56.194
(narrator)
Don't get too comfortable, Jay.

24:56.261 --> 24:58.997
We're about to
crank up the heat.

24:59.064 --> 25:02.334
{\an1}So I figured y'all could use
another round of drinks.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.203
{\an1}Hey!

25:02.400 --> 25:05.203
Oh!

25:09.040 --> 25:10.208
(narrator)
Welcome back.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.443
Morgan and Jay
were sent on a date

25:11.509 --> 25:13.211
away from the house
and surprise,

25:13.278 --> 25:15.347
surprise,
it was a trap.

25:15.413 --> 25:16.748
(sinister laughter)

25:16.815 --> 25:19.317
{\an1}So I figured y'all could use
another round of drinks.

25:19.384 --> 25:22.053
{\an1}Hey. Hey, Morgan.
Hey, Jay.

25:22.120 --> 25:25.557
{\an8}It's my sister. What
is my sister doing here?

25:25.624 --> 25:30.528
{\an6}Oh!

25:25.624 --> 25:30.528
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

25:30.595 --> 25:33.164
{\an8}(bleep)!

25:33.231 --> 25:37.535
{\an8}Like a (bleep) grenade.
Boom! I'm screwed.

25:37.602 --> 25:41.606
{\an1}The last thing you told me
was that you and and Jay

25:41.673 --> 25:44.009
{\an4}were kind
of done, right?

25:41.673 --> 25:44.009
Mm-hmm.

25:44.075 --> 25:46.544
{\an1}So, I'm kind of confused
why this whole thing

25:46.611 --> 25:49.981
{\an4}has been rekindled
when we all know it's
counterproductive?

25:50.048 --> 25:54.419
{\an5}Like, I feel like we're
taking a step backwards
and not a step forward.

25:54.486 --> 25:57.322
{\an5}You put your sister
on me and now you're
pulling out?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.291
{\an1}All I did was
introduce y'all.

25:59.357 --> 26:00.725
Literally, verbatim.

26:00.792 --> 26:03.561
"Jay Stefan, playboy of
'Survivor,' he's a blast.

26:03.628 --> 26:05.130
{\an5}Y'all are both crazy.
Go talk to him."

26:03.628 --> 26:05.130
{\an1}Yeah.

26:05.196 --> 26:07.732
I was like, "He's a party
boy. Jay is a party boy.

26:07.799 --> 26:10.201
{\an4}You're gonna love Jay.
He's so much fun
to drink with."

26:10.268 --> 26:12.637
{\an1}It wasn't, "Oh, my God,
I'm in love with Jay.

26:12.704 --> 26:15.740
{\an1}Let's potentially date
and see what happens

26:15.807 --> 26:17.409
{\an1}and then it's not
gonna work and then we go

26:17.475 --> 26:19.711
{\an1}back and forth
for six months or whatever.

26:19.778 --> 26:22.080
{\an8}"Jay, hey, what's up?
Nice to see you," dah-dah-dah.

26:22.147 --> 26:25.650
{\an8}So the reason I'm here is
to shatter your (bleep) soul.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.352
Do you really think
that I'm not good

26:27.419 --> 26:28.620
for like your sister?

26:28.687 --> 26:30.655
{\an1}I think that you have
so much potential,

26:30.722 --> 26:33.858
{\an1}but I haven't seen
you make any changes

26:33.925 --> 26:35.460
to be what she needs.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.128
{\an8}She's my best friend,
my everything.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.697
{\an8}She knows me to a tee.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.932
{\an8}She's the smart, intelligent,
like level-headed one.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.969
{\an8}I'm like the crazy psycho,
like make very rash decisions.

26:44.035 --> 26:45.470
{\an8}So it's like, do I listen to her

26:45.537 --> 26:48.139
or do I listen to Jay
who like has opened up to me

26:48.206 --> 26:49.874
so much in this house?

26:49.941 --> 26:51.409
{\an8}I'm so confused.

26:51.476 --> 26:53.511
{\an1}That's gonna be my parting
words of wisdom

26:53.578 --> 26:55.413
{\an1}because I'm gonna let y'all
finish y'all's dinner.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.948
This was a lovely dinner...

26:57.015 --> 26:58.316
{\an4}(laughing)

26:57.015 --> 26:58.316
...until you came.

26:58.383 --> 27:00.085
This is worse
than the Shack of Secrets.

27:00.151 --> 27:01.820
{\an3}Bye, sis.
Bye, Jay.

27:01.886 --> 27:02.854
Bye, Alex.

27:04.422 --> 27:05.957
{\an1}For her to say that,
I just feel like

27:06.024 --> 27:08.426
she has to say something.

27:08.493 --> 27:10.228
What do you think
her reason is?

27:10.295 --> 27:12.297
I just-- I'm now confused.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.199
(narrator)
Looks like Morgan and Jay

27:14.265 --> 27:16.234
might be sleeping alone tonight.

27:16.301 --> 27:19.437
But I can't say the same
for Corey.

27:20.372 --> 27:21.673
What's up, baby?

27:27.278 --> 27:29.814
{\an5}(Corey)
Me and Jozea used to cuddle
all the time on "Big Brother."

27:29.881 --> 27:32.817
{\an8}Just my personality,
I'm very flirtatious.

27:32.884 --> 27:35.687
{\an8}So, you know, any time someone
wants to cuddle,

27:35.754 --> 27:37.622
{\an8}hell yeah, like
I mean, who cares?

they're spooning.

Jozea is the big spoon.

{\an8}They're so cute.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.347
{\an5}(Sha)
Corey literally is cuddling
with someone else.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.716
{\an8}I don't know what to do.

28:04.783 --> 28:06.251
{\an8}It's weird.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.123

about it.

At this point, I do feel
like she's overreacting.

28:23.101 --> 28:24.402
{\an8}And she needs to just chill.

28:24.469 --> 28:27.739

I wanna go home.

28:27.806 --> 28:29.541
I seriously do.

28:33.678 --> 28:35.313
It's like the only reason
I'm here is 'cause of him.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.116
{\an1}So then explore something
with him.

28:38.183 --> 28:39.851
{\an1}Talk to him.
Talk through things.

28:39.918 --> 28:41.419
But don't shut off.

28:41.486 --> 28:43.421
{\an8}I am definitely
a jealous girlfriend.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.390
{\an8}Like whatever's mine is mine.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.392

Girl, guy, doesn't matter.

like it, it's weird.

I don't approve.

more than I trust my mom.

{\an8}If Alex showed up,
there's an issue.

29:40.478 --> 29:43.414
{\an8}I think we're seeing the end
of Morgan and Jay.

{\an8}(mimics bomb dropping)

29:52.490 --> 29:54.626

like she's fine.

29:54.692 --> 29:56.694

and talk to me, mother(bleep).

for half a second.

30:03.168 --> 30:05.436
{\an8}Jay is an emotional person.

30:05.503 --> 30:07.672
{\an8}And I think if he doesn't
reel it in,

30:07.739 --> 30:08.840
{\an8}it's gonna (bleep) up
his chances

30:08.907 --> 30:10.108
{\an8}about staying with Morgan.

30:10.175 --> 30:12.844
When we talked to her,
she was like, I see...

30:12.911 --> 30:14.112
{\an1}She was like, there was
a lot of things said

30:14.179 --> 30:15.513

how to process it,

30:15.580 --> 30:16.681
and this is what happened.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.082
{\an1}She explained it
very openly.

30:18.149 --> 30:20.418
{\an1}She was like, my sister
just doesn't approve of her.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.819
{\an1}And she was like,
it's not--

30:21.886 --> 30:24.155
Why? Your sister
put you on me.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.191

At first, "Jay's funny
and he's fun

30:26.257 --> 30:28.259
and he's attractive
and everything that you like."

30:28.326 --> 30:29.961

and she's like,

you know what I mean?

30:42.807 --> 30:45.276

39:24.862 --> 39:26.464
Nelson, you didn't
have to (bleep) come here!

39:26.530 --> 39:28.232
{\an1}Oh, I came here--
I came here for a reason.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.101
{\an5}You did not!

39:28.299 --> 39:30.101
{\an1}I think you wanted me
to be here.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.837
{\an5}Hopefully Corey and Morgan
are able to navigate
calmer waters.

39:32.903 --> 39:35.439
Oh, Morgan.

39:32.903 --> 39:35.439
{\an3}Oh, Corey.

39:35.506 --> 39:37.441
Jeez, man, I don't know.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.910
{\an4}So far, my time with you
has been pretty
interesting, I think.

39:39.977 --> 39:43.647
I just would rather
either close the door,

39:43.714 --> 39:46.484
{\an1}like figure out everything
so we can both more forward,

39:46.550 --> 39:49.019
{\an5}'cause, like, you have
an ex in the house,
I have an ex in the house.

39:49.086 --> 39:51.522
{\an1}Yeah.

39:49.086 --> 39:51.522
So it's like, I--

39:51.589 --> 39:54.592
{\an1}Can you see yourself
dating after the house?

39:54.658 --> 39:57.995
Yeah, I think so.

39:54.658 --> 39:57.995
{\an1}Really.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.764
{\an1}I don't see
all together necessarily.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.199
{\an6}Why though?

39:59.830 --> 40:02.199
{\an1}Y'all are just
way different people.

40:02.266 --> 40:04.335
{\an1}You know?
I don't know.

40:04.401 --> 40:05.803
{\an5}I just don't see it.

40:04.401 --> 40:05.803
I feel like we're good.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.805
{\an1}Y'all seem like y'all
are just playing it out now.

40:07.872 --> 40:09.106
Like, I just feel like

40:09.173 --> 40:11.375
{\an1}it's not, like,
super, like, passionate.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.444
{\an4}You know, I don't see
a lot of there.
I just don't.

40:13.511 --> 40:16.447
{\an5}So do you see
"passion"
between us then?

40:16.514 --> 40:18.382
{\an1}I think there's
more there between us

40:18.449 --> 40:20.484
than you and Jay.

40:20.551 --> 40:22.253
You're saying you think
I should not be with Jay

40:22.319 --> 40:23.687
and I should be with you?

40:23.754 --> 40:25.656
{\an8}Miss 100% of the shots
you don't take,

40:25.723 --> 40:28.425
{\an8}I think that Morgan and I
have a very special affection,

40:28.492 --> 40:30.127
{\an8}so let's do this.

40:30.194 --> 40:31.829
{\an1}I feel like I just
didn't even get a chance.

40:31.896 --> 40:33.497
So you're saying
you want a chance.

40:33.564 --> 40:34.565
{\an1}I mean, yeah.
I like you.

40:34.632 --> 40:36.066
{\an1}So, this is
what you wanted.

40:36.133 --> 40:37.501
{\an1}Like, how does
that make you feel?

40:37.568 --> 40:39.069
{\an8}Augh!

40:39.136 --> 40:42.273
I wish you would've
said that from the get-go.

40:42.339 --> 40:44.475
{\an8}(Morgan)
The whole situation's weird.

40:44.542 --> 40:46.043
{\an8}Which is, like, confusing me.

40:46.110 --> 40:49.346
{\an8}My heart says go for Corey.
Like, he's my type.

40:49.413 --> 40:52.817
{\an8}My conscience says
go for the good guy, Jay.

40:52.883 --> 40:55.786
{\an8}Do you do what your heart says
or what your conscience says?

40:55.853 --> 40:57.421
{\an1}I just don't see
you and Jay together,

40:57.488 --> 40:59.390
{\an1}so I'm doing you
both a favor, honestly.

40:59.456 --> 41:00.825
Like, I feel like
it would've different

41:00.891 --> 41:02.493
had, like, you come in
straight away and then

41:02.560 --> 41:04.795
like, "Hey, like I feel
this way about you."

41:04.862 --> 41:07.798
{\an5}But instead it was like,
"Oh, I completely
blew you off because--"

41:07.865 --> 41:09.867
{\an4}So you want me to show you
I'm, like, serious
about this or what?

41:09.934 --> 41:13.637
Yes! No--
Corey!

41:21.912 --> 41:23.414
{\an8}(narrator)
Next time on "Ex on the Beach,"

41:23.480 --> 41:27.418
{\an8}Morgan's kiss with Corey
sends Jay into a jealous rage.

41:27.484 --> 41:28.686
{\an8}(bleep)!

41:28.752 --> 41:30.120
{\an8}Nelson's arrival at the house

41:30.187 --> 41:32.122
{\an8}spells trouble
for Malcolm and Nurys.

41:32.189 --> 41:33.657
{\an5}You do not have my back.

41:32.189 --> 41:33.657
Don't put this out on me.

41:33.724 --> 41:35.726
Today's my day, bitch.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.695
And there's a shocking twist
at elimination

41:37.761 --> 41:43.567
that no one sees coming.

41:43.634 --> 41:46.570
