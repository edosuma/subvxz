[computer chimes]

00:28.400 --> 00:29.240
Who are you?

00:48.320 --> 00:50.320
[theme music playing]

01:16.240 --> 01:17.240
[softly] What?

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
[sighs]

01:21.480 --> 01:24.240
-[Parker] Hey, Soph. What's up?
-Oh, God, I--

01:25.600 --> 01:27.200
I think I lost my Louie somewhere outside.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.800
All right, let's just go find it.
Uh, I can even call it for you.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.320
No, no. It's dark outside,

01:32.400 --> 01:34.440
-and it could be anywhere now. [scoffs]
-Yeah.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.360
Damn, Ryan's gonna think
I'm such an idiot.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.680
No, she won't know that.

01:38.680 --> 01:42.520
I... [chuckles] She won't think that.
You know what I meant.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.080
Uh, I mean, if you want,

01:44.160 --> 01:46.840
we could look and see
if there's any spares in Marcus's office.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.600
What happened?

01:53.680 --> 01:59.440
Yo, it smells like a combination of mildew
and old bologna sandwiches in there.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.080
-Really?
-Yes!

02:01.160 --> 02:03.240
And when are they gonna hire
a new groundskeeper, anyway?

02:03.320 --> 02:05.480
It's been, like, over a month.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.520
-Do you have it?
-[sighs]

02:07.600 --> 02:09.400
-Oh, okay.
-[chuckles softly]

02:09.480 --> 02:11.240
-Thank God.
-I got you.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.120
This is perfect.
Thank you so much, Parker.

02:13.199 --> 02:15.120
-You're my hero.
-I guess, yeah.

02:15.199 --> 02:17.040
-[sighs]
-I told you not to worry about it.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.240
-[Sophie] Yeah.
-Ryan's pretty easy. Don't worry.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.640
[upbeat song playing on stereo]

02:27.040 --> 02:30.040
It's just, I love... your coffee.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.400
Good morning.

02:31.480 --> 02:36.040
-Hey, honey. How many pancakes?
-Uh... zero. I'm going on a run.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.800
Run... errands?

02:37.880 --> 02:39.720
-Very funny.
-[knocking at door]

02:42.920 --> 02:44.520
-[Hayley] Hey, babe.
-Hey, babe.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.120
Ready for our run?

02:46.880 --> 02:49.280
Hey, Daniel. Would you like a pancake?

02:49.360 --> 02:53.520
Yes. But could I take a rain check
for 45 minutes from now?

02:53.600 --> 02:54.680
Wait, what? Forty-five minutes?

02:54.760 --> 02:57.160
[chuckles] She's tougher than she knows.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.920
See you in a bit. Come on.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.600
-[door opens]
-[Alex] Okay.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.400
Two blueberry pancakes

03:02.480 --> 03:04.200
-that she's back in ten minutes.
-[door closes]

03:04.280 --> 03:06.200
Three chocolate chips, she's back in two.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.960
Oh, I'll make that wager.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.840
-[Ryan chuckles]
-[knocking at door]

03:09.920 --> 03:13.880
Uh-huh. Do I know my daughter,
or do I know my daughter?

03:16.400 --> 03:17.560
-Carter Woods?
-Yes?

03:17.640 --> 03:19.960
[officer] Chief Diggs told us
to contact you.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.880
Jason Osmond has escaped from prison.

03:23.880 --> 03:28.160
Go call Brooke. She should find out
from us before anyone else tells her.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.520
Gentlemen, let's talk outside.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.640
I missed you last night at the dorm.

03:36.720 --> 03:40.920
You know, now that your parents
aren't around, I can finally do this.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.160
-Mmm.
-[chuckles]

03:43.320 --> 03:44.680
Nice outfit.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.280
Be ready to carry her back
after she collapses in about...

03:48.360 --> 03:50.600
-four minutes.
-[sarcastically] Hilarious.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.280
[Leo] Unless, who knows?

03:52.360 --> 03:54.680
Maybe there's been
an Eagle in you all along, ready to fly.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.240
She'll be fine, bro.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.360
You? Not so sure about.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.680
[grunts]

04:33.720 --> 04:34.960
[clicks mouse]

04:35.040 --> 04:36.720
[officer] <i>There was a riot in the prison.</i>

04:36.800 --> 04:39.760
<i>Uh, Jason Osmond,</i>
<i>we don't know how he got out,</i>

04:39.840 --> 04:42.520
<i>but we believe somebody</i>
<i>was waiting for him outside.</i>

04:44.160 --> 04:45.600
[Brooke] I can't believe it.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.760
-Does my dad know?
-I'm sure they've told him.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.920
-But you should call him.
-I will.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.800
Brooke, you know,
your brother could be armed

04:53.880 --> 04:56.360
or with some bad people.

04:56.440 --> 04:59.200
If he tries to make contact,
please don't engage him.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.840
Tell us, and Carter will handle it, okay?

05:02.920 --> 05:04.480
[Louie ringing]

05:04.560 --> 05:06.200
Excuse me, I have to take this.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.000
Brooke, we have to tell her.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.680
-[whispering] No. You promised.
-[Ryan speaking indistinctly]

05:10.760 --> 05:13.320
[whispering] Look, I covered for you
because I love you.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.680
And you made him leave.
I'm sure he's far away from here.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.360
What's the use
in telling people about it now,

05:18.440 --> 05:19.400
when he's not gonna hurt anyone?

05:19.480 --> 05:20.880
Because lying about things

05:20.960 --> 05:24.320
is exactly what led to your dad
having to leave the Greenhouse.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.880
If police find out we were hiding Jason,
my mom could lose her job.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.400
[Ryan] And if you do...

05:33.240 --> 05:34.520
[line ringing]

05:36.160 --> 05:37.640
[ringing]

05:44.920 --> 05:47.640
You want me to try locating
your Louie's signal?

05:47.720 --> 05:49.040
I think I know how to do it.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.840
If not, there's at least ten Ravens nerds
that could help.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.880
No, no, it's okay. I...
I don't want to bother anyone.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.120
No, no, no, it's no... bother.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.240
[door rattling]

06:12.680 --> 06:13.520
[bag zipping]

06:14.800 --> 06:17.000
This is the old groundskeeper's office.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.280
The one who's in prison?

06:18.360 --> 06:20.000
[Carter] Yeah. That's the one.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.480
All right.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.360
Look around.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.880
After this, we'll check out the cave
I was telling you about.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.400
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

06:49.640 --> 06:52.520

Good luck finding him in Mexico.

-[Alex] Mom, I have to tell you something.
-Alex!

07:17.760 --> 07:19.640
I see. Are you sure?

07:19.720 --> 07:22.480
-Okay. I'll... I'll let them know.
-[Louie beeps]

07:23.360 --> 07:24.480
Uh, Brooke...

07:25.600 --> 07:28.000
Your brother managed to leave the country.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.200
-What? What does that mean?
-[Alex sighs]

07:30.280 --> 07:35.920
I... I have no idea how he did this,
but, uh, he's gone.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.760
Brooke, are you all right?

07:40.880 --> 07:41.840
I guess.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.920
-Uh, what did you wanna say?
-[Alex] Um...

07:48.680 --> 07:49.960
[sighs] Nothing.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.400
I'm just... so glad you're here.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.000
Well, that's a relief.
Now everything can go back to normal.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.840
"Normal"? My brother is a fugitive.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.880
I'm sorry, but he did this to himself.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.920
-Why are you always defending him?
-Because he's my brother.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.960
Wouldn't you do the same thing
with your sister?

08:14.040 --> 08:14.960
Not if she was a criminal.

[footsteps approaching]

09:00.240 --> 09:01.840
Well, hello, Jason.

09:02.840 --> 09:03.680
What?

09:07.720 --> 09:08.560
Who are you?

09:09.960 --> 09:10.960
Me?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.360
I'm your new best friend.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.280
I like it. Let's do it.

09:38.360 --> 09:41.680
Yeah, it'll get their brains working.
They need to get back to some normalcy.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.920
Absolutely. We all do. [sighs]

-In the entire Greenhouse.

[groans]

09:52.400 --> 09:56.560
[grunts] Whose idea was it, moving here?
What am I even looking for?

09:56.640 --> 09:58.680
[laughing] I don't know.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.760
A pipe... leaking water... about to burst.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.880
Really? Isn't that something
you saw in a cartoon?

10:05.960 --> 10:07.520
[Ryan chuckling]

10:07.600 --> 10:08.600
I mean, look at us.

10:08.680 --> 10:12.360
A NASA genius and an FBI agent
beaten by a bunch of pipes.

[both exclaim]

10:16.640 --> 10:18.560
Oh! [laughing]

10:19.360 --> 10:20.520
Oh, I know who you are.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.040
You're the client
Judy was always talking about.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.000
The one who paid her
to create the earthquake.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.640
I don't understand. How'd you get me out?

10:30.720 --> 10:34.600
I told you... I'm your best friend.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.520
You want the magnetite.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.680
You're gonna create another earthquake.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.320
Please.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.080
Earthquakes are so last year.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.000
I've got better uses for this beauty.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.840
-[Daniel grunting]
-[Hayley panting]

11:04.920 --> 11:08.280
Come on, babe, big finish.
This physical labor's good for you.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.280
This is awful.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.400
[grunts] You can do it, okay?

11:13.960 --> 11:15.040
I believe in you.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.360
[grunts] All you gotta do is get started
and it gets easy from there.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.760
There you go.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.080
-[Hayley grunts]
-[Daniel exhales sharply]

11:23.160 --> 11:27.160
[Hayley straining] How do you do that?
Oh, my God. No.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.400
[sighs] I'll just lie here.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.720
I wanna show you something.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.280
[chuckles softly]

11:47.560 --> 11:49.640

11:50.880 --> 11:53.600
<i>I'm here to report a serious incident.</i>

11:54.200 --> 11:55.120
<i>There's been an accident.</i>

11:56.160 --> 11:58.120
My team ran a series of tests,

11:58.200 --> 12:01.760
one of which was checking
the magnetite's reaction to heat.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.440
When the magnetite was heated
past 200 degrees,

12:04.520 --> 12:07.280
it began to emit
some sort of poisonous gas.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.960
-What?
-[shushes]

12:09.040 --> 12:10.520
<i>When I arrived, it was already too late.</i>

12:10.600 --> 12:13.280
<i>The entire lab</i>
<i>was filled with orange smoke.</i>

12:13.360 --> 12:17.520
<i>The scientists were comatose.</i>
<i>The veins on their hands turned black.</i>

12:23.000 --> 12:25.560
[scoffs] Isn't it just amazing?

12:26.680 --> 12:29.840
Those black veins
are a by-product of the virus.

12:31.000 --> 12:31.840
The virus?

12:31.920 --> 12:34.120
It's a virus
that's trapped inside the magnetite,

12:34.200 --> 12:38.120
and there's no cure for it, obviously,
because the rock is from the moon.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.680
-What happened to those scientists?
-Oh. They're dead.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.640
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.480
They were dead within 24 hours.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.960
But, hey, thanks to them...

12:49.880 --> 12:52.440
I discovered the perfect weapon.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.040
What? How're you gonna use it?

12:55.120 --> 12:59.120
You mean, how are we going to use it?

13:03.920 --> 13:07.400
So, you need to name as many things
in that category as possible.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.080
I need an Eagle to draw their category.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.160
Thank you.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.400
"US National Parks."

13:22.640 --> 13:25.920
Okay, guys, you have
30 seconds from now. Go.

-Yosemite.
-Uh, Glacier Park.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.560
-Uh, Old Faithful.
-Not a park, minus a point.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.680
-Wait, no, no. Are you sure?
-[Suzanne] Ten seconds, guys.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.400
Alex, come on. Remember when Mom and Dad
took us on that 50-state tour?

13:36.480 --> 13:37.880
Come on, think west to east. Um...

13:37.960 --> 13:39.440
-[Alex] Uh...
-Uh, Redwood!

13:39.520 --> 13:41.840
Joshua Tree. What was that one?
That really gorgeous one?

13:41.920 --> 13:42.920
-Zion.
-Yes!

13:43.000 --> 13:44.960
Bryce Canyon. Grand Teton. Uh--

13:45.040 --> 13:47.520
Time's up. After the deduction,
you have nine points.

13:47.600 --> 13:48.880
-Yes!
-[indistinct chatter]

13:50.400 --> 13:51.800
Okay, I need a Raven.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.800

"Films directed by Steven Spielberg."

14:06.320 --> 14:07.320
Ah. Easy.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.640
How'd they get that one?

14:08.720 --> 14:11.040
All right, 30 seconds. And go.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.440
<i>E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws.</i>

14:12.520 --> 14:14.000
God, I love this man so much,
I wanna have his babies.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.640
Save the nerd-worship for later.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.200
-Uh,<i> Jurassic Park.</i>
<i>-Gremlins.</i>

14:17.280 --> 14:19.080
No, he was just an executive producer
on that one.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.120
"Just executive producer"?
The man is a god.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.280
-[Suzanne] Minus a point.
<i>-The Color Purple.</i>

14:22.360 --> 14:24.040
-He produced that one.
-Produced and directed.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.320
Don't question
my Steven Spielberg knowledge.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.600
-I wasn't, I was--
-[Leo] Okay, will you two shut up?

14:27.680 --> 14:30.240
[inhales deeply] Okay.
Okay, I have one. Uh...

14:30.320 --> 14:31.360
[sighs] What's it called?

14:31.440 --> 14:33.360
-Ten seconds...
-Uh, no, I have it. It's, um--

14:33.440 --> 14:34.360
Do you want a hint?

14:34.440 --> 14:35.800
Stop dominating everything, Max.

14:35.880 --> 14:36.960
I thought you wanted to win.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.400
I can't think like this, guys. Damn!

14:38.480 --> 14:39.560
<i>Ready Player...</i>

14:39.640 --> 14:40.680
-Time is up.
<i>-...One.</i>

14:40.760 --> 14:41.800
[Max sighs]

14:41.880 --> 14:43.480
[Suzanne] I'll give you that.
But after the deduction,

14:43.560 --> 14:44.920
-you have five points, guys.
-[Eagles] Ooh.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.320
Eagles in the lead.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.720
[Eagles cheering]

14:47.800 --> 14:49.000
-That's right.
-[Max] <i>Hook,</i>

14:49.080 --> 14:51.640
<i>Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List,</i>
three more <i>Indiana Jones</i> films--

14:51.720 --> 14:53.040
-[Leo] Okay, stop.
-[Emma] Max, stop.

14:53.120 --> 14:53.960
Please.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.480
[waves crashing]

14:57.680 --> 14:58.640
I don't understand.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.960
You're gonna kill people with this virus?

15:02.040 --> 15:04.840
[sighs] Only if they don't pay me.
Don't be so morbid.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.440
-What if they don't have the funds?
-Well...

15:07.520 --> 15:10.520
I'm not stupid enough
to hold poor people hostage.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.840
Where's the sense in that?

15:19.400 --> 15:22.200
-[Jason] Who are they?
-They're gonna help us take the magnetite.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.520
"Let It Be."

15:25.600 --> 15:26.440
"Hey Jude."

15:26.520 --> 15:27.400
"Jailhouse Rock."

15:27.480 --> 15:29.680
That's Elvis. Seriously, Parker?

15:29.760 --> 15:31.240
Uh, "Come Together."

15:31.320 --> 15:32.160
-"Something."
-Yes.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.840
Uh, "Maxwell's Silver Hammer,"
"I Want You,"

15:34.920 --> 15:37.120
"Octopus's Garden." Uh, "Oh! Darling."

15:37.200 --> 15:38.960
Um, uh, "Here Comes the Sun."

15:39.040 --> 15:41.920
Time is up, and that is 14. Very good.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
-[Eagles cheering]
-Yes!

15:44.800 --> 15:47.520
My dad played <i>Abbey Road</i>
on a continual loop as a kid,

15:47.600 --> 15:48.960
just like any good parent.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.560
Like any easy category.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.240
So, Eagles are ahead with 85 points.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.600
Ravens have 77.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.920
-You guys need nine points to win.
-Whoo! Yeah!

15:58.480 --> 16:01.440
[Suzanne]
And the last category, guys, is...

16:02.040 --> 16:03.440
"One-term US presidents."

16:03.520 --> 16:04.400
-[Parker] Ooh.
-[Sophie exhales sharply]

16:04.480 --> 16:06.080
-Ooh, that's difficult.
-[Alex laughs]

16:06.160 --> 16:08.680
-That's too hard.
-No, piece of cake. We got this, guys.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.160
Okay, guys, you have 30 seconds. Go.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.680
George Bush. The old one.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.560
John Adams. John Quincy Adams.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.360
There's more. Come on, guys. Gerald Ford.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.840
I was gonna say that one. [inhales deeply]

16:19.920 --> 16:22.000
Uh, okay, let me think. Uh, Carter.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.080
Right. You're good.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.080
-Okay.
-[Max] Herbert Hoover.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.240
[Suzanne] Ten seconds...

16:25.320 --> 16:29.560
Come on! We are better than this.
We are better than them.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.520
[both scoffing]

16:30.600 --> 16:31.560
-[Becca] Right, Leo?
-You wish.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.880
Thinking, thinking, thinking.
Grover Cleveland!

16:32.960 --> 16:34.400
Just say Cleveland, we're running out of--

16:34.480 --> 16:35.760
Time. That's it.

16:35.840 --> 16:40.280
Well, the Ravens have seven points,
which means the Eagles have won.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.280
-Yes!
-[cheering]

16:41.920 --> 16:44.040
-Yes!
-Yeah, boy.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.720
That category was way harder
than The Beatles' songs.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.080
-She's right.
-[Hayley] Oh, really?

16:49.160 --> 16:51.840
Because I think I remember Taft,

16:51.920 --> 16:54.560
Harrison, Johnson and Van Buren.
Am I right, guys?

16:54.640 --> 16:55.920
[Eagles whooping]

16:56.000 --> 16:58.400
-[Daniel] Eagles...
-[Eagles cheering]

16:58.480 --> 17:02.800
[all chanting] Eagles, Eagles...

17:02.880 --> 17:07.320
Eagles, Eagles.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.680
Eagles... [cheering]

17:09.760 --> 17:11.319
Good job, guys.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.720
Uh, especially,
thanks to your brilliant daughter.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.640
-[Ryan] Really?
-[Daniel] Mmm-hmm.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.839
-Congratulations, Hayley.
-Thanks, Mom.

17:16.920 --> 17:17.839
[Sophie] Eagles.

17:17.920 --> 17:18.800
-See you later.
-See you, Ms. Woods.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.319
-See you.
-[both] Eagles.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.960
-[Ryan] Oh, Sophie?
-Yeah.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.160
Our new groundskeeper
found your Louie outside.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.280
Did you know it was missing?

17:26.359 --> 17:28.040
Oh, I... Uh...

17:28.880 --> 17:30.040
-No. No.
-You know, we...

17:30.119 --> 17:31.760
We weren't allowed to use it
during the challenge,

17:31.839 --> 17:34.600
so she probably didn't even realize
her Louie was missing.

17:34.680 --> 17:35.640
Yeah. [chuckles nervously]

17:35.720 --> 17:36.760
Tell him thanks for finding it.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.640
Well, he's right here.
You can thank him yourself.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
This is Enzo.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.280
So, you're Sophie, right?

17:46.120 --> 17:47.240
I saw your picture when I opened it.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.080
Nice to meet you.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.040
[Ryan] Um...

17:54.120 --> 17:55.480
Oh, yeah. For sure, yeah.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.360
Phew, that was close.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.360
He seems pretty cool, right?

18:02.920 --> 18:04.440
[exhales sharply] Yeah.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.640
I'm not hungry.

18:13.240 --> 18:17.000
I know you're bummed we lost.
We all are.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.840
I personally think Hayley found a way
to cheat somehow.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.480
She didn't cheat.

18:23.040 --> 18:26.360
Well, regardless of your opinion...

18:27.160 --> 18:28.160
Leo...

18:29.800 --> 18:35.040
You know I think you're awesome,
but you've gotta snap out of this funk.

18:35.120 --> 18:39.480
You're our captain,
and we need you to be strong,

18:39.560 --> 18:42.640
or everyone else
is gonna go down with you.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.440
You know?

18:47.520 --> 18:48.560
Are you mad?

18:48.640 --> 18:52.040
Don't be mad, I was just telling you
because I thought--

19:10.200 --> 19:12.640
Don't you think they'll notice
the magnetite's gone?

19:21.920 --> 19:24.640
[chuckles] See? It's a fake.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.880
Even sounds real.
No hollow echo, no nothing.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.160
Now, let's get the hell out of this dump.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.360
How are you gonna get us out of here
without anyone noticing?

19:46.440 --> 19:48.160
Oh, don't worry, I thought of everything.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.280
<i>Let's just say I created a small...</i>

20:00.800 --> 20:01.840
diversion.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.000

20:08.320 --> 20:10.320
["Wish I Never Met You" playing]
