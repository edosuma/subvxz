WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:03.586
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.670 --> 00:05.422
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.590
- I CALL TO ORDER
THE FIRST MEETING

00:07.674 --> 00:09.134
OF PROJECT OSCAR.

00:09.217 --> 00:11.261
NOW THE ACADEMY AWARD BALLOTS
ARE BEING MAILED OUT THIS WEEK

00:11.344 --> 00:13.304
AND I AM DETERMINED
TO BE NOMINATED.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.265
SO FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS...

00:15.348 --> 00:18.268
- GET A TIME MACHINE AND GIVE
A BETTER PERFORMANCE?

00:21.688 --> 00:23.732
- I HAVE HIRED OUR
LITTLE DETECTIVE HERE

00:23.815 --> 00:25.734
TO TRACK DOWN
ANY ACADEMY MEMBERS

00:25.817 --> 00:27.110
LIVING IN THE CLEVELAND AREA.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.154
- I WAS ABLE TO FIND
ALL THREE MEMBERS.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.155
- [gasps]

00:30.238 --> 00:31.573
I GOT COREY CHAMBERS?

00:31.656 --> 00:33.408
OH, HE WAS MY FAVORITE
TEEN ACTOR IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.784
I WAS OBSESSED WITH HIM.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.953
I DREAMED THAT
HE'D ASKED ME TO PROM.

00:37.036 --> 00:40.290
I KNEW HE WOULD SEE PAST
MY ACNE AND BACK BRACE AND...

00:40.373 --> 00:42.125
LAZY BOOB.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.169
- "LAZY BOOB"?

00:44.252 --> 00:47.088
- ONE BOOB WAS SLOWER TO GROW.

00:47.172 --> 00:50.175
- JOY HAS TWO OF THOSE.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.015
- THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.475
MY HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
IS COMING UP,

00:58.558 --> 00:59.809
AND I WASN'T GONNA GO.

00:59.893 --> 01:03.021
BUT WHAT IF WE MEET
AND FALL IN LOVE,

01:03.104 --> 01:05.355
LIKE I ALWAYS DREAMED,
AND I BRING HIM TO MY REUNION?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.692
THAT'LL SHOW 'EM.
WHO'S "SMELL-ANIE" NOW?

01:10.528 --> 01:14.783
IT'S HARD TO SHOWER
WITH A BACK BRACE.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.993
- THIS MIGHT BE
A GOOD TIME TO STRESS

01:17.076 --> 01:19.621
THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE FOOLS
OF YOURSELVES WITH THESE ACTORS.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.080
- GOT IT, GOT IT.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.708
OH, HE VOLUNTEERS AT PETSMART
CHARITY ADOPTION EVENTS.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.001
SO DO I.
THAT'S MY IN.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.211
- EXCELLENT.
ELKA?

01:26.294 --> 01:28.713
- I'VE GOT RUSTY BANKS.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.381
I REMEMBER HIM.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.716
- HE WAS A CHILD ACTOR,

01:31.800 --> 01:33.051
BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF HIS MOVIES.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.344
- OH, THEY WERE WESTERNS.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.428
AND THEY CALLED HIM
THE COMEBACK KID

01:35.512 --> 01:37.639
BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS TELLING
PEOPLE TO COME BACK.

01:37.722 --> 01:41.935
- "YOU'RE COMING BACK,
AIN'T YOU, CHINA JOE?"

01:42.018 --> 01:44.646
TERRIBLE MOVIE.

01:44.729 --> 01:48.316
- WELL, MY ACTOR IS IVY JOHNSON.

01:48.399 --> 01:49.567
- OH, FROM
<i>NIGHT OF THE HEREAFTER.</i>

01:49.651 --> 01:51.528
I SAW THAT LAST WEEK.
SHE IS AMAZING.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.071
- OH, SO YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.197
AND IT'S HER FIRST MOVIE.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.909
- YES, WE ALL HATE HER.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.494
- BUT WON'T SHE JUST VOTE
FOR HERSELF?

01:59.577 --> 02:02.121
- WELL, OF COURSE.
BUT SHE CAN NOMINATE ME AS WELL.

02:02.205 --> 02:05.041
OR MAYBE SHE'S ONE
OF THOSE HONORABLE PEOPLE

02:05.124 --> 02:06.543
WHO REFUSE TO VOTE
FOR THEMSELVES,

02:06.626 --> 02:10.255
LIKE I SAY I AM.

02:10.338 --> 02:12.215
- IVY'S STAYING
WITH HER PARENTS.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.384
SHE ONLY GOES OUT TO GO
TO GROUP THERAPY.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.719
WORD ON THE STREET IS
SHE'S A HOT MESS.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.431
- OH, GOOD.
MY WORD GOT OUT.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.684
- I'LL BE INFILTRATING
THAT THERAPY GROUP.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.728
FRANKLY, I'M HAPPY
FOR THE DIVERSION.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.231
EVER SINCE SIMON LEFT,
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN DATING.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.816
[sighs]

02:29.899 --> 02:31.192
BUT I KNOW HE MAY
NEVER COME BACK,

02:31.276 --> 02:33.903
SO I MUSTN'T PUT ALL MY EGGS
IN ONE BASKET.

02:33.987 --> 02:38.283
- YOU GOT ENOUGH EGGS LEFT
TO NEED A BASKET?

02:40.451 --> 02:42.912
- SPEAKING OF EGGS, ELKA,

02:42.996 --> 02:46.124
SINCE YOU WERE THERE,
WAS IT THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG?

02:50.962 --> 02:53.256
[upbeat music]

02:53.339 --> 02:55.466
♪ BA BA BA BA ♪

02:55.550 --> 02:58.887

02:58.970 --> 03:00.221

03:00.305 --> 03:03.933
{\an8}- EXCUSE ME,
MR. BANKS?

03:04.017 --> 03:06.311
{\an8}- THE ONE AND ONLY.
[laughs]

03:06.394 --> 03:08.062
{\an8}- ROY!

03:08.146 --> 03:09.439
{\an8}YOU'RE RUSTY BANKS?

03:09.522 --> 03:10.982
{\an8}- YES, MA'AM.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.276
{\an8}HOW ARE YOU, ELKA?
HAVE A SEAT.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.529
{\an8}- WHAT'S IT BEEN?
TWO YEARS?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.823
{\an8}- YEAH, EVER SINCE MY MOM
WOULDN'T LET ME

03:18.907 --> 03:21.910
{\an8}DATE YOU ANYMORE.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.329
{\an8}- I REMEMBER.
[both laugh]

03:24.412 --> 03:27.498
{\an8}IS SHE...WELL?

03:27.582 --> 03:29.000
{\an8}- OH, YEAH.
SHE'S GREAT.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.127
{\an8}SHE GOT REMARRIED LAST YEAR.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.963
{\an8}NOW, OF COURSE,
MY BABY STEPBROTHER

03:34.047 --> 03:35.423
{\an8}GETS ALL THE ATTENTION.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.717
{\an8}- "BABY STEPBROTHER"?
- YEAH.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.344
{\an8}JUST TURNED 70.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.180
{\an8}KIDS DO SAY
THE DARNDEST THINGS.

03:42.263 --> 03:46.017
{\an8}MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE DEMENTIA.
[laughs]

03:46.100 --> 03:49.312
{\an8}- I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE IN SHOW BUSINESS.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.857
{\an8}- OH, I MADE 50 PICTURES
BEFORE I WAS TEN.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.777
{\an8}BUT THEN HOLLYWOOD DECIDED
I WASN'T CUTE ANYMORE,

03:55.860 --> 03:57.820
{\an8}SO WE MOVED BACK TO OHIO.

03:57.904 --> 04:02.617
- WELL, A CUTE KID IS NICE,
BUT A HANDSOME MAN IS NICER.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.832
- THAT IS WONDERFUL.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.126
IVY, CAN YOU GO A LITTLE DEEPER
WITH THAT THOUGHT?

04:12.210 --> 04:15.046
- [mumbling] I JUST WANT
TO SCREAM AND DISAPPEAR.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.176
- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
WE CAN ALL RELATE TO, RIGHT?

04:20.259 --> 04:22.303
- I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH THAT.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.515
WHAT DID SHE SAY?
- [gasps]

04:25.598 --> 04:27.892
- IVY HAS SOME ISSUES WITH
VOCAL CONFIDENCE RIGHT NOW.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.229
SHE'S FEELING SOME ANXIETY DUE
TO THE PRESSURES OF FAME.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.855
BUT WE'RE GONNA HELP HER
THROUGH IT, RIGHT?

04:32.939 --> 04:34.691
- [mumbling]
THANK YOU.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.318
- HOW ABOUT YOU, JOY?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.362
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE
TO SHARE WITH THE GROUP?

04:39.445 --> 04:41.072
- OH, I'M NOT SURE
IF I'M READY YET,

04:41.155 --> 04:43.408
BUT YOU GUYS CARRY ON.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.536
- [mumbles indistinctly]

04:48.746 --> 04:52.250
- I THINK IVY SUMS IT
UP PERFECTLY.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.876
- SHE DOES?
- YEAH.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.712
GROUP CAN BE DAUNTING
AT FIRST.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.505
JUST TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF,
ANYTHING AT ALL.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.215
- OKAY.
[laughs]

04:59.298 --> 05:01.259
MY NAME IS JOY.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.387
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM BRITAIN
BUT MOVED TO LOS ANGELES

05:04.470 --> 05:07.557
WHERE I STARTED
A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.643
[crying] AND NOW SIMON'S
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD!

05:10.727 --> 05:12.562
HE SAID HE'D COME BACK,

05:12.645 --> 05:15.398
BUT HE'S ALREADY LINED UP
TWO MORE ASSIGNMENTS.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.568
SO I JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT
THAT HE'S SOMEONE

05:18.651 --> 05:22.071
WHO'S NEVER GONNA STAY
WITH ME.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.948
- THAT WAS A GOOD SHARE, JOY,
AND I THINK JOHN--

05:24.032 --> 05:25.908
- THE PROBLEM IS

05:25.992 --> 05:29.287
I CAN'T HELP COMPARING
EVERY GUY I MEET TO HIM.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.080
I CAN'T MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE.

05:31.164 --> 05:35.043
- [mumbles indistinctly]

05:35.126 --> 05:36.711
- SHE SAID THAT--
- I KNOW.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.047
I UNDERSTOOD THIS TIME.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.882
[all clapping]

05:44.469 --> 05:46.846
SO ROY IS RUSTY BANKS?

05:46.929 --> 05:48.431
- AND HE AGREED
TO VOTE FOR ME?

05:48.514 --> 05:52.435
- YOUR NAME NEVER CAME UP.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.896
- WELL, SEE THAT IT DOES.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.815
JOY, WERE YOU ABLE TO INFILTRATE
IVY'S THERAPY GROUP?

05:57.899 --> 05:58.858
- YES.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.777
I POSED AS AN UNSTABLE WOMAN,

06:00.860 --> 06:04.739
AND THEY BOUGHT IT.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.617
- THERE'S YOUR
OSCAR PERFORMANCE.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.954
- ACTUALLY, THERAPY WAS QUITE
CATHARTIC.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.956
I THINK IF I KEEP GOING,
I CAN WORK THROUGH

06:14.040 --> 06:15.583
SOME OF MY ISSUES
WITH SIMON.

06:15.666 --> 06:17.126
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT IVY?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.669
- OH, POOR THING.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.296
SHE'S CLEARLY INSECURE

06:20.379 --> 06:21.672
AND STRUGGLING
WITH HER SUDDEN FAME.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.466
- EXCELLENT.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.426
IF WE CAN FUEL
THOSE INSECURITIES,

06:25.510 --> 06:27.470
MAYBE WE CAN CONVINCE HER
TO DROP HER NAME

06:27.553 --> 06:29.430
FROM THE OSCAR BALLOT
COMPLETELY.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.850
{\an1}OH, PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO VOTE FOR
THE OTHER FRESH-FACED INGENUE.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.647
ME.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.440
- OKAY, BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
YEAH, I KNOW.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.942
I GOT A HUGE ZIT
ON MY FOREHEAD.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.985
- WHAT? NO.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.447
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.075
- IT'S LIKE A THIRD EYE.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.330
IT'S FOLLOWING ME.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.669
- OH, IT'S MOVED
TO MY CHIN TOO.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.838
IT'S FROM THAT CREAM
YOU GAVE ME.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.965
YOU SAID THE FDA
WOULDN'T APPROVE IT

07:04.048 --> 07:05.133
'CAUSE THEY WERE JEALOUS.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.051
- HUH.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.803
I MAY HAVE MADE THAT UP.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.179
SO HOW DID IT GO WITH COREY?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.806
- OH, GREAT, I THINK.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.182
I WAS ABLE TO LURE HIM OVER
TO THE HOUSE.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.517
AND OF COURSE
I WAS SUPER EXCITED.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.145
BUT I THINK WE MADE
A REAL CONNECTION.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.856
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SITTING
NEXT TO COREY CHAMBERS.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.315
AND I'M BEING COMPLETELY REAL

07:21.399 --> 07:22.650
BECAUSE I REMEMBER
IN <i> TIGER BEAT</i>

07:22.733 --> 07:25.027
YOU SAID YOU HATED PHONIES.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.655
- YEAH.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.198
[clears throat]

07:29.282 --> 07:31.325
YOU SAID THAT THIS WAS
A FUNDRAISING EVENT?

07:31.409 --> 07:32.660
- YEAH, I'M GONNA WRITE
A CHECK.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.496
- AND THAT JIM BROWN
WOULD BE HERE.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.707
- YEAH, I MIGHT HAVE MADE
THAT UP.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.876
I'M SORRY,
IT'S JUST THAT

07:39.959 --> 07:41.544
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER,
I USED TO HAVE

07:41.627 --> 07:42.879
YOUR POSTER OVER MY BED,

07:42.962 --> 07:45.882
AND I WOULD DREAM
THAT YOU WOULD COME ALIVE

07:45.965 --> 07:47.550
AND CRAWL INTO MY BED,

07:47.633 --> 07:49.844
AND THEN I WOULD PULL
THE SHEETS REAL TIGHT

07:49.927 --> 07:52.054
SO YOU COULDN'T ESCAPE.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.931
- [chuckles nervously]

07:55.892 --> 07:57.643
- IT WAS A LITTLE ROCKY
AT FIRST,

07:57.727 --> 07:59.687
BUT I CHARMED HIM.

07:59.770 --> 08:03.566
IN FACT, I RSVP'D YES
TO MY HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.067
IF THINGS GO AS PLANNED,

08:05.151 --> 08:06.903
I AM SHOWING UP WITH COREY
ON MY ARM.

08:06.986 --> 08:07.904
- WOW.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.198
YOUR PLAN,
JOY'S BREAKTHROUGH,

08:10.281 --> 08:11.449
ELKA'S HAPPINESS--

08:11.532 --> 08:14.368
LISTEN TO YOURSELVES!

08:14.452 --> 08:15.912
SUCH SELFISHNESS.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.122
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT MY OSCAR?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.333
CLEARLY, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO FIND SOME CLEVER WAY

08:20.416 --> 08:22.293
TO INSERT MYSELF
INTO YOUR ASSIGNMENTS.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.377
NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.462
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.214
I MADE A REAL CONNECTION
WITH COREY.

08:26.297 --> 08:29.425
AND I WILL TALK TO HIM ABOUT YOU
THE NEXT TIME I SEE HIM.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.427
- MELANIE MORETTI?
- YES.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.136
- THIS IS A RESTRAINING ORDER.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.938
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE
WITH THE GREAT RUSTY BANKS.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.775
NOT JUST A LEGEND, BUT
A VOTING MEMBER OF THE ACADEMY

08:45.858 --> 08:47.443
FOR OVER 50 YEARS.

08:47.526 --> 08:48.903
- OH, I DON'T VOTE ANYMORE.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.738
- WHAT?

08:52.531 --> 08:54.116
- IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT
TO VOTE.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.952
I DON'T ACT ANYMORE.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.788
- SO, WHAT I'M HEARING IS
THAT

08:58.871 --> 09:01.415
THE DORMANT ACTING BUG
IS AWAKENING.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.335
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE.

09:04.418 --> 09:08.297
- OH, LISTEN TO THAT PASSION.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.300
NOW I'LL JUST BET
THAT THERE IS A DREAM PROJECT

09:11.384 --> 09:13.010
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

09:13.094 --> 09:16.639
- WELL, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE KIND OF NEAT

09:16.722 --> 09:18.641
IF THE COMEBACK KID MADE
A COMEBACK

09:18.724 --> 09:19.767
IN A ONE-MAN REVUE.

09:19.850 --> 09:20.977
- WHERE DO I BUY A TICKET?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.812
- [laughs]

09:22.895 --> 09:25.147
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.
- OH, I DO, I DO.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.190
OH, LET'S DO IT, ROY.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.650
I'LL BANKROLL THE WHOLE THING.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.610
LET'S UP ON A SHOW
AND SEE

09:29.694 --> 09:31.195
WHERE THIS OLD COW TRAIL
TAKES US.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.947
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.198
- OKAY!

09:34.282 --> 09:35.324
LET ME GET MY STETSEN

09:35.408 --> 09:39.704
AND MY COWBOY DANCE-BELT.
- [laughs]

09:42.415 --> 09:45.835
- WHAT THE HELL?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.839
- WELL, IF HE STARTS ACTING,

09:49.922 --> 09:52.216
THEN HE'LL START VOTING
FOR THE OSCARS AGAIN.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.177
BUT ACTORS ARE
SO SELF-CENTERED

09:55.261 --> 09:58.180
AND OBNOXIOUS.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.058
- YOU DO REALIZE
THAT I'M AN ACTOR.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.894
- THE ONLY ONE I KNOW.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.696
- HEARING ABOUT JOY'S SAD LIFE

10:13.779 --> 10:15.489
REALLY MADE ME FEEL BETTER
ABOUT MY OWN.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.533
- I GET THAT A LOT.

10:17.616 --> 10:20.202
- WELL, I'VE BEEN MAKING
SOME PROGRESS.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.704
AND IT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH,

10:21.787 --> 10:23.581
BUT I'VE BEEN READING
THESE SCRIPTS,

10:23.664 --> 10:25.249
AND I MADE A CALL TO MY AGENT
TO LET HIM KNOW

10:25.333 --> 10:26.334
I'M BACK IN THE GAME.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.753
- OH.
[all clapping]

10:28.836 --> 10:32.298
- IF I COULD ADD TO THAT.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.009
- OH, EVERYONE, LET'S HEAR FROM
OUR NEW MEMBER, VICTORIA.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.218
- HI.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.888
I'M JUST SO INSPIRED BY IVY.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.890
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK
I COULD'VE HANDLED

10:40.973 --> 10:43.851
SO MUCH SUCCESS AT SUCH
AN EARLY AGE.

10:43.934 --> 10:47.438
NO WONDER YOU SAY,
"I FEEL LIKE A FRAUD."

10:47.521 --> 10:49.690
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

10:49.774 --> 10:50.900
- WELL, YOU OR THE CRITICS--

10:50.983 --> 10:52.902
SOMEONE HAS
OR WILL HAVE SAID IT.

10:52.985 --> 10:56.364
- I HATE TO SAY THIS TO
A NEWCOMER I DON'T KNOW,

10:56.447 --> 10:58.532
BUT SHUT UP, VICTORIA.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.742
- I WOULD,
BUT I'M JUST--

10:59.825 --> 11:02.370
I'M SO SCARED,
YOU KNOW, FOR IVY.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.915
SHE IS BLINDLY WALKING INTO
A RED-HOT BUZZ SAW OF CRITICISM,

11:05.998 --> 11:08.417
FRESH MEAT
TO BE RIPPED APART.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.669
SO HERE'S TO YOU.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.421
YOU ARE MY HERO, IVY.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.591
- [mumbles indistinctly]

11:15.674 --> 11:17.301
- I'M SORRY, DEAR.
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:17.385 --> 11:18.761
- [muttering]

11:18.844 --> 11:21.847
- CAN ANYBODY?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.280
- THIS IS A MIRROR, MELANIE.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.075
I CAN SEE YOU.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.118
- HI.

11:42.201 --> 11:48.207
I GUESS YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY I'M WEARING GLASSES.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.626
- THE HUNDREDS OF THINGS
I'M WONDERING RIGHT NOW,

11:50.709 --> 11:53.504
GLASSES ARE NOT ON THE LIST.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.297
- I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.466
THIS IS
A REALLY TERRIBLE IDEA.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.760
I'M DOING ALL OF THIS FOR
A REALLY GOOD FRIEND

11:59.844 --> 12:02.096
AND NOW I FEEL STUPID
AND RIDICULOUS

12:02.179 --> 12:03.556
AND I'M SO, SO SORRY.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.767
- LOOK,
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY CRAZY.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.353
BUT YOU SEEM HARMLESS.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.313
HOPEFULLY HARMLESS.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.941
SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.484
DOUBLE YOUR DONATION
TO THE CHARITY,

12:15.568 --> 12:17.319
STAY OUT OF THE MEN'S ROOM,

12:17.403 --> 12:18.821
AND I'LL DROP
THE RESTRAINING ODER.

12:18.904 --> 12:19.655
- THANK YOU.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.658
YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.
- GOOD.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.994
- UNLESS YOU WANT TO.
- GOOD-BYE, MELANIE.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.330
- THANK GOD THAT WORKED.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.167
- IT DID NOT!

12:31.250 --> 12:34.211
THE WHOLE POINT WAS
TO GIVE HIM THE DVD OF MY MOVIE.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.130
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY YOU
WERE OVERCOME THAT DAY

12:36.213 --> 12:38.007
BY MY PERFORMANCE
IN <i> CLEVELAND RHAPSODY.</i>

12:38.090 --> 12:38.966
NOW GET OUT THERE
AND GIVE IT TO HIM.

12:39.049 --> 12:39.967
- OKAY.
- GO!

12:40.050 --> 12:42.803
- COREY! WAIT UP!

12:47.558 --> 12:49.435
- I HATE YOU, VICTORIA.

12:49.518 --> 12:50.853
YOU RUINED THERAPY FOR ME.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.856
- I HATE YOU TOO.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.191
YOU MADE ME CHASE AFTER COREY,

12:55.274 --> 12:58.527
AND NOW THE RESTRAINING ORDER
IS 1,000 FEET.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.654
- I HATE YOU THE MOST.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.994
- OH, ELKA, YOU LOOK ADORABLE.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.205
- I AM NOT ELKA.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.208
I'M PRAIRIE SUE.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.043
ROY PUT ME IN HIS SHOW.

13:14.126 --> 13:19.131
DAGNABBIT.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.675
- SETTING ASIDE EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE TO US,

13:21.759 --> 13:23.385
YOU'VE ALSO DASHED
THE HOPES AND DREAMS

13:23.469 --> 13:25.262
OF THAT
SWEET YOUNG ACTRESS IVY.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.807
- LOOK, SHE'S GOT DECADES AHEAD
OF HER TO GET NOMINATED.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.060
THIS IS PROBABLY MY ONLY CHANCE.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.395
AND I THINK I'M JUST
ONE THERAPY SESSION AWAY

13:33.479 --> 13:36.106
FROM GETTING HER TO SCRATCH HER
NAME OFF THAT LIST.

13:36.190 --> 13:40.069
- THIS OSCAR OBSESSION HAS
TURNED YOU INTO A MONSTER.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.112
- REALLY, MELANIE?

13:42.196 --> 13:45.032
I'M THE MONSTER IN THE ROOM?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.710
- ALL I EVER WANTED TO BE
WAS AN ACTOR.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.588
I GREW UP INSPIRED BY
THE GRAND OLD ACTRESSES

13:59.672 --> 14:01.298
OF YESTERYEAR.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.926
JULIA ROBERTS,

14:04.009 --> 14:05.803
MOLLY RINGWALD,

14:05.886 --> 14:08.764
ELIZABETH SHUE.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.225
BUT NOW I REALIZE
I HAVE TO QUIT

14:11.308 --> 14:14.895
THE THING I LOVE THE MOST
BECAUSE FAILING AT IT

14:14.979 --> 14:17.439
IS THE THING
THAT SCARES ME THE MOST.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.775
SO...
[breath trembles]

14:19.858 --> 14:22.111
I'M MOVING BACK TO CLEVELAND
FOR GOOD

14:22.194 --> 14:24.071
TO WORK
AT MY DAD'S GAS STATION.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.658
NO PRESSURE,
NO EXPECTATIONS.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.159
I WISH I HAD THE STRENGTH

14:29.243 --> 14:30.953
AND CONFIDENCE
THAT VICTORIA HAS,

14:31.036 --> 14:33.414
BUT I DON'T.

14:35.874 --> 14:39.003
- I BARELY KNOW VICTORIA,
BUT SOMETIMES

14:39.086 --> 14:42.548
STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE
CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE AND SELFISH.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.591
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.467
ALSO SOMETIMES,
PEOPLE WHO APPEAR

14:45.551 --> 14:48.637
TO BE STRONG AND CONFIDENT ARE
ACTUALLY MASKING DEEPER FEARS.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.764
- [laughs]
OH, NO. THAT ISN'T ME.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.975
I MEAN, SURE.
IT'S AWARDS SEASON.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.436
AND OF COURSE THAT
BRINGS UP SOME FEARS.

14:55.519 --> 14:58.814
AND I REALLY, REALLY WOULD
LIKE TO WIN.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.190
BUT, LOOK.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.444
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS
OVERWHELMING DESIRE

15:03.527 --> 15:04.987
TO WIN AWARDS COMES FROM.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.323
PROBABLY MY CHILDHOOD,
BUT, WELL,

15:07.406 --> 15:10.117
THIS IS HARDLY THE PLACE
TO DELVE INTO THAT.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.454
- WELL, IT KIND OF IS.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.122
I MEAN, IT'S A THERAPY GROUP.

15:15.205 --> 15:18.626
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
ABOUT YOURSELF.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.837
- WELL, I'VE NEVER DONE ENSEMBLE
THERAPY BEFORE,

15:21.920 --> 15:24.298
BUT OKAY.

15:24.381 --> 15:27.009
I WAS BORN IN A SMALL TOWN
IN UPSTATE NEW YORK...

15:27.092 --> 15:30.304
[crying]
CALLED ME A LOSER.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.181
[sniffles]

15:32.264 --> 15:34.183
UNTIL I BROUGHT THAT AWARD HOME
FROM SCHOOL.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.560
AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
MY FATHER EVER TOLD ME

15:36.644 --> 15:37.978
HE WAS PROUD OF ME.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.855
AND SO WHEN IT CAME TIME

15:39.938 --> 15:41.148
FOR ME TO DECIDE
WHAT I WANTED TO DO,

15:41.231 --> 15:44.193
I THOUGHT, WELL,
WHAT PROFESSION

15:44.276 --> 15:48.197
CONSTANTLY GIVES ITSELF AWARDS
JUST FOR DOING ITS JOB?

15:48.280 --> 15:50.074
ACTING.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.702
IVY, I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.538
I CAME HERE TO GET YOU TO DROP
OUT OF THE OSCAR RACE.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.125
BUT YOU CAN'T QUIT ACTING.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.878
I SAW YOUR PERFORMANCE
IN <i> NIGHT OF THE HEREAFTER.</i>

16:02.961 --> 16:05.047
AND HATED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.384
THAT'S HOW GOOD YOU WERE.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.718
- WOW.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.346
HATRED FROM AN ACTRESS
OF YOUR STATURE.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.723
THANK YOU.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.183
BUT WHAT IF I AM A FRAUD
AND THAT PART

16:16.266 --> 16:17.685
IS THE ONLY PART
THAT I CAN PLAY?

16:17.768 --> 16:20.187
- IVY, IT'S CRAZY TO THINK
THAT WAY.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.398
AT YOUR AGE, YOUR BEST ROLES
ARE YET TO COME.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.441
- WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
YOUR BEST RELATIONSHIP

16:24.525 --> 16:25.776
ISN'T YET TO COME?

16:25.859 --> 16:26.568
I MEAN, YOU'RE PRETTY YOUNG.
WHAT ARE YOU?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.612
LIKE, 35?

16:28.696 --> 16:32.574
- YEAH, I'M, LIKE, 35.
YES.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.410
- JOY, IVY'S RIGHT.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.078
I MEAN, THERE MUST BE
TONS OF GUYS

16:36.161 --> 16:38.414
OUT THERE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE AS LOVELY

16:38.497 --> 16:41.208
AND OPEN AND HONEST AS YOU.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.876
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.586
HE LISTENS TO PROBLEMS.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.588
YOU HAVE PROBLEMS.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.466
IN THE MOVIE BUSINESS,
WE CALL THIS A "MEET CUTE."

16:49.550 --> 16:51.385
- IN THE THERAPY BUSINESS,
WE CALL THAT

16:51.468 --> 16:52.886
QUESTIONABLE ETHICS, SO...

16:52.970 --> 16:54.930
- I'LL QUIT GROUP.
- HOW'S SATURDAY NIGHT?

16:55.013 --> 16:57.766
- SEE YOU THEN.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.101
- LOOK.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.103
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
YOUR UPS AND DOWNS

17:01.186 --> 17:03.147
AND YOU'LL FEEL LIKE
A FRAUD SOMETIMES.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.065
WE ALL DO.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.443
BUT, IF YOU'D LET ME,
I'D REALLY LIKE TO HELP YOU

17:07.526 --> 17:09.153
OVER THE ROUGH PATCHES.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.405
- I'D LIKE THAT.

17:11.488 --> 17:15.867
AND IF YOU'D LET ME, I'D LIKE TO
TAKE YOU SWEATER SHOPPING.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.914
- THANK YOU.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.630
- [whistles]

17:28.714 --> 17:31.133
[sniffs]

17:31.216 --> 17:32.509
OKAY, I SMELL WOMEN'S PERFUME.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.928
MELANIE, IS THAT YOU AGAIN?

17:35.012 --> 17:37.473
- ACTUALLY,
IT'S VICTORIA CHASE.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.599
- I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

17:38.682 --> 17:39.975
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

17:40.058 --> 17:41.351
- HMM, A BETTER QUESTION
WOULD BE

17:41.435 --> 17:45.314
WHY IS YOUR CLUB SECURITY
SO LAX?

17:45.397 --> 17:47.775
LOOK, YOU HAVE A RESTRAINING
ORDER AGAINST MY FRIEND,

17:47.858 --> 17:49.151
MELANIE MORETTI.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.111
BUT IT'S REALLY ALL MY FAULT.

17:51.195 --> 17:54.031
- [sneezes]

17:54.114 --> 17:55.115
- SHE'S HERE, ISN'T SHE?

17:55.199 --> 17:58.202
- HI, COREY.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.371
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO YOU?

18:01.455 --> 18:02.706
- OH, I CAN EXPLAIN.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.459
YOU KNOW HOW IN YOUR MOVIES
THE POWER OF LOVE

18:05.542 --> 18:07.628
MADE AWKWARD GIRLS
BEAUTIFUL.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.672
WELL, HERE IT DID THE OPPOSITE.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.008
- I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE,
VICTORIA. THANKS.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.845
LOOK, MY HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
IS COMING UP,

18:16.929 --> 18:19.681
AND I HAD THIS STUPID IDEA
THAT I WOULD ASK YOU

18:19.765 --> 18:20.682
TO GO WITH ME.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.601
I GUESS IT'S IMPORTANT

18:22.684 --> 18:25.395
BECAUSE I WAS JUST SUCH
A LOSER IN HIGH SCHOOL.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.856
YEAH, I LOOKED LIKE--

18:27.940 --> 18:29.525
WELL, WHAT I LOOK LIKE NOW.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.859
[laughs]

18:30.943 --> 18:32.861
I GUESS SOMEONE LIKE
YOU COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.071
- REALLY?

18:34.154 --> 18:37.825
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.243
- UGH.
- OH.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.328
- MM.
- POOR THING.

18:41.411 --> 18:44.122
- WHO IS SHE?
- THAT'S ME.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.875
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.712
LOOK, I'LL DROP
THE RESTRAINING ORDER, OKAY?

18:50.796 --> 18:53.257
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ACTUALLY
SAYING THIS,

18:53.340 --> 18:55.551
BUT THE ANSWER IS YES.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.261
- WHAT?
- I'LL GO WITH YOU.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.054
TO YOUR REUNION.
- SERIOUSLY?

18:59.137 --> 19:01.390
OH, MY GOD!

19:01.473 --> 19:04.893
COREY CHAMBERS IS GOING TO MY
HIGH SCHOOL REUNION WITH ME.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.061
AND MAYBE IF WE HAVE
A GOOD TIME,

19:06.144 --> 19:08.230
WE CAN HAVE A PROPER DATE.
BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE A WHOLE--

19:08.313 --> 19:09.398
- HONEY, HE SAID YES.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.109
LET'S JUST QUIT
WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.404
- JUST WANTED TO MEET YOU.
BIG FAN.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.531
