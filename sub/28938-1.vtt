WEBVTT

02:22.343 --> 02:23.742
- What are
you doin' here?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.711
Thought you didn't
come until tomorrow.

02:25.713 --> 02:26.612
- Today.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.780
What are you wearin'?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.550
- My house, I can
dress how I want.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.254
- Why don't ya
put some pants on.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.622
- Why, 'cause you're here?

02:37.758 --> 02:41.160
Last time you were, you
said it wasn't good enough.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.167
- Couldn't last six
months, huh, J.C.?

02:50.371 --> 02:53.272
Our boy's got quite the
discipline problem, Linda.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.344
- Hey, give your
brother a ride to the store.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.546
- I haven't
eaten since yesterday.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.214
- Give your brother a ride.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.482
I'll rustle somethin' up.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.317
It'll be on the table
by the time ya get back.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.102
- Ah!

03:08.689 --> 03:10.455
No discipline, huh?

03:24.838 --> 03:25.904
- Tom!

03:35.716 --> 03:37.249
Tom!

03:50.864 --> 03:53.232
- All right, boys.
- Okay.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.639
- Glad
you could make it.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.574
- Mornin', Darrell.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.809
- You get lost?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.277
- Nah, how ya doin'?

04:05.279 --> 04:06.645
- We're okay, this is
one of the buildings

04:06.647 --> 04:08.947
we gotta do.
- Yeah.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.382
- It needs a lot.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.352
We can get her done
quick, make more money.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.389
- That's Tom Enterprises,
quick, right there.

04:31.005 --> 04:34.506
- We got some drywallin'
to do in here.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.577
You guys do hang Sheetrock?

04:39.747 --> 04:43.548
- Oh yeah, yeah that's our
in-house pro right there

04:43.550 --> 04:44.750
at hangin' drywall.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.819
Ain't that right, J.C.?

04:47.821 --> 04:49.788
He's the best.

04:50.758 --> 04:51.990
- What's wrong with him?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.292
- Military.

04:53.894 --> 04:54.860
- Oh, you served, son?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.428
- He did.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.797
Kicked his ass out.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.799
- Well my dad was military.

05:27.061 --> 05:29.394
- Now where you goin'?

05:29.396 --> 05:32.664
- I gotta pick up some
plastic siding for tomorrow.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.965
I'll be back in an hour.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.772
- That's a piss poor job.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.907
That looks like shit.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.577
Job's runnin' into
more time and money.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.681
I bid everything on
materials and time,

05:49.683 --> 05:52.050
but the longer you
take doin' this job,

05:52.052 --> 05:54.353
the less money I make.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.721
I want an itemized receipt.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.390
We need to get this job done.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.826
You're not gonna get
paid, ya understand?

06:00.828 --> 06:02.494
Burnin' daylight.

07:19.072 --> 07:19.971
- Hey!

07:21.742 --> 07:22.641
Hey!

07:47.167 --> 07:48.700
- Why you back?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.617
The hell you ridin'
a bicycle for?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.187
You get a DUI?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.622
- No.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.492
- Then come on, let's
go get you a real bike.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.894
This guy that I work
for, he's got more money

08:15.896 --> 08:19.064
than he knows what to
do with, so hop on.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.636
Hop on.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.207
- Seriously?

08:30.911 --> 08:32.010
- He won't care.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.078
Just bring her back.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.815
Or don't, I won't say nothin'.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.051
Start her up.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.022
You look like James Dean.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.592
Woo!

10:16.350 --> 10:18.650
- Where'd ya get that?

10:18.652 --> 10:19.351
- Harris.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.221
Why you drivin' Tom's truck?

10:23.223 --> 10:25.223
- Well, I was late to
a client's meeting,

10:25.225 --> 10:28.259
and Tom's in a bar,
doesn't need it.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.327
- You're kidding me.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.396
- What's that?

10:31.398 --> 10:33.898
- Supplies for a job Tom
was supposed to be on.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.034
- Well, you know Tom.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.203
He's the brains behind
it, not the worker bee.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.006
You get money for
those supplies?

10:42.242 --> 10:45.276
- Yeah, from Darrell,
contractor at the middle school.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.850
- Spare $10 for gas,
consider it my commission?

10:51.852 --> 10:52.917
- All I got is 20.

10:52.919 --> 10:53.785
- That'll do.

11:02.396 --> 11:03.261
Love ya, honey.

11:11.371 --> 11:14.072
- What the hell was that?

11:36.930 --> 11:39.230
- Daytime activities.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.435
- Well, well, well.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.403
Took ya long enough to
finish that wall, junior.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.072
- You're never gonna
amount to anything.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.173
- Hey.

11:48.942 --> 11:49.841
Ah!

11:51.445 --> 11:53.211
- Hey,
hey, knock it off.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.979
- Expect me to do
all the work for you?

11:54.981 --> 11:56.147
- Hey, okay, hey.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.449
Okay, leave him alone.

11:57.451 --> 11:58.917
Get him a beer.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.052
- I'll get ya a beer.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.186
I couldn't decide

12:01.188 --> 12:03.188
what my table was on.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.055
- Here.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.826
Good work today, though, junior.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.802
- Is he goin' to the
speedway next week?

12:18.805 --> 12:21.139
- Why don't you ask him.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.040
- Speedway?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.142
- Yeah.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.309
- You guys
still doin' that?

12:25.312 --> 12:27.879
- As long as the old
dog still owns it.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.248
Hey, I'll call.

12:34.521 --> 12:35.420
- I can't go.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.923
Got dinner with the in-laws.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.425
- They'll be outlaws
in a couple of years,

12:40.427 --> 12:43.294
isn't that right,
J.C.?

12:43.296 --> 12:44.529
Isn't that right, J.C.?

12:44.531 --> 12:46.097
He knows how it is.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.300
Damn fool, went and
got himself engaged.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.202
Can I buy ya a drink?

12:51.204 --> 12:53.471
- My boyfriend
may not like that.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.140
- Who's your boyfriend?

12:55.142 --> 12:57.208
- He's
not from around here.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.543
- If I was to talk

12:58.545 --> 13:00.378
to your boyfriend,
- Mm-hmm.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.046
- and he said it was okay,

13:02.048 --> 13:03.081
- Yeah?

13:04.184 --> 13:06.184
- you'd drink with me?

13:06.186 --> 13:09.087
- What are you buyin' me?

13:09.089 --> 13:11.055
- Anything you want.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.357
- Okay.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.129
- Hey!

14:25.966 --> 14:27.498
The hell outta here!

14:42.148 --> 14:44.382
So listen for--

14:48.588 --> 14:52.156
- Wake up, you
got paintin' to do.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.296
- Other than
the stain on your record,

14:58.298 --> 15:02.333
Mr. Phillips, the military
isn't interested in pursuing it.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.668
- Any chance of reenlistment?

15:04.971 --> 15:06.771
- There's no
chance of reenlistment.

15:06.772 --> 15:08.572
You have RE-4 status, which
means you can never again

15:08.575 --> 15:11.276
apply for a military position.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.280
You have a good day.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.131
- Come on in!

15:34.467 --> 15:36.334
It's for you, babe.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.371
- You want some food?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.375
- I'm all right.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.110
- You sure?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.248
- Have some food, stay.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.251
- Hey, babe, we're gonna
go in the other room, okay?

16:06.633 --> 16:07.532
What's wrong?

16:09.402 --> 16:11.202
- Can I stay here?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.076
- I don't think so, man.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.444
We don't have enough room.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.649
I need you to stay at Mom's.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.319
- What about work?

16:30.223 --> 16:32.190
- Nothin' that you'd
be interested in.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.159
- I can do anything.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.696
Clean toilets,
drive the backhoe.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.369
Whatever.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.443
- How do you feel
about killin' animals?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.383
- Like a slaughterhouse?

17:00.587 --> 17:04.489
- My boss and his brother's
got shitter horses on his land

17:04.491 --> 17:06.523
and they're eatin'
up all of his grass.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.627
And it's costin'
'em a lot of money.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.465
- Can't ya sell 'em off?

17:15.468 --> 17:17.568
- Nothin' they can do with 'em.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.338
Bunch of studs kicked
over some fences

17:20.339 --> 17:22.540
and tried to mate
with the nicer horses.

17:24.344 --> 17:28.378
So, the old lady
wants 'em to go.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.484
- How much you offerin'?

17:34.454 --> 17:36.154
- Couple hundred apiece.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.465
Don't say anything to her.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.471
I've put her through
enough already.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.576
- All right.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.353
- What's with the drone?

18:43.556 --> 18:45.523
- I
forgot to charge it.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.795
- They spotted a herd out
here a couple of nights ago.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.764
Guess we just gotta
go find, 'em boys.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.505
- This legal?

19:39.212 --> 19:43.214
- BLM can't figure it out,
so we gotta do it ourselves.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.516
- Can't let the government
do anything by itself.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.620
- I mean, ranchers call
it in all the time, man.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.657
- Why don't they
just drive them out?

19:52.659 --> 19:55.626
- See, the ranchers pay
for the land, right,

19:55.628 --> 19:56.627
but they don't got enough grass.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.496
Now you don't have enough grass,

19:58.498 --> 20:01.332
you can't pay your bills,
feed your families.

20:02.502 --> 20:07.505
Ranchers are this community,
but BLM, they don't care.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.340
Just politics, man.

21:02.528 --> 21:03.728
- You get one?

21:04.597 --> 21:05.730
- I missed.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.708
- Scared
off the whole herd.

21:17.710 --> 21:18.609
- I saw it.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.979
Great big white one
right down there.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.683
He fired a shot into the
air and spooked him off.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.328
- I'll take that.

21:47.373 --> 21:48.439
- What the hell is wrong

21:48.441 --> 21:49.674
with you?
- Leave him!

21:50.543 --> 21:52.376
He can take it, he's tough.

21:56.716 --> 21:57.682
Come on.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.731
- You're on my land.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.567
What are ya doin'?

23:24.837 --> 23:26.971
- I was campin' with friends.

23:26.973 --> 23:27.938
We got separated.

23:30.777 --> 23:33.444
- Well you're away from town
if that's where you're headed.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.149
- How far?

23:38.985 --> 23:40.451
- 10 or so miles.

23:43.689 --> 23:44.588
That way.

23:51.497 --> 23:52.696
You huntin' or fishin'?

23:59.539 --> 24:00.604
- I'm sorry.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.118
- This one's got no tack on it.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.119
You can jump on him.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.021
- I don't know how.

24:18.758 --> 24:19.723
- You'll find out.

24:32.004 --> 24:32.903
Other side.

24:45.685 --> 24:46.784
Hold on to his mane.

24:47.787 --> 24:48.919
He won't do much.

24:49.789 --> 24:50.888
Come on.

25:11.878 --> 25:13.777
- This your place?

25:13.779 --> 25:14.945
- Last time I checked.

25:42.775 --> 25:43.674
Get off.

25:45.845 --> 25:46.944
Take that.

25:56.722 --> 25:57.988
Need a ride someplace?

25:58.991 --> 26:00.758
- No, I appreciate it.

26:05.064 --> 26:05.963
Borrow a phone?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.066
- I'll give ya a ride.

26:11.938 --> 26:12.836
Come on.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.709
What kind of job do you work?

26:18.711 --> 26:22.947
- Construction, odd
jobs, whatever really.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.682
Why, ya got somethin' for me?

26:30.990 --> 26:33.223
- These are all my horses.

26:45.271 --> 26:48.005
Picked 'em up at the BLM corral.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.108
- I keep hearin' that.

26:52.044 --> 26:52.943
What is that?

26:54.046 --> 26:56.146
- Bureau of Land
Management agency.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.949
Set up to manage federal lands.

27:02.989 --> 27:03.954
- How many ya got?

27:05.024 --> 27:07.625
- Oh, 20 or so.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.862
Otherwise they just round 'em
up and ship 'em off to Canada.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.099
- They got more room up there?

27:16.202 --> 27:17.101
- No.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.970
They got legal slaughtering.

27:21.907 --> 27:23.374
- Is it illegal here?

27:24.143 --> 27:25.409
- For now, thank God.

27:26.946 --> 27:30.648
My aim is to set
up a non-profit,

27:30.650 --> 27:33.350
pull out as many as
I can, rescue them,

27:33.352 --> 27:35.953
set up a kind of a
destination point, ya know.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.288
Get the public involved,
maybe the veterans.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.060
- That one there the alpha?

27:44.964 --> 27:46.030
That banged up one.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.034
- The old mares tend
to be the alphas.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.038
- And the stallions?

27:54.040 --> 27:55.939
- Strength doesn't
make you an alpha.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.376
Stallions generally
just fend off predators

27:59.378 --> 28:01.145
like coyotes and
things like that.

28:02.948 --> 28:04.148
- And the mares?

28:05.084 --> 28:09.086
- See, her job is to
create submissiveness,

28:10.990 --> 28:12.222
dependency with the others.

28:12.224 --> 28:15.392
I mean look, you see
how alert she is?

28:16.729 --> 28:18.228
The others look to her
to know how to react.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.073
- She vicious?

28:31.210 --> 28:32.109
- Can be.

28:42.788 --> 28:43.754
- Oh!

29:10.349 --> 29:12.282
- Round of applause!

29:12.284 --> 29:13.183
Woo!

30:33.833 --> 30:34.531
- Mornin'.

30:35.401 --> 30:36.300
- Mornin'.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.337
You lookin' for Linda?

30:40.339 --> 30:43.440
- I work for the Bureau
of Land Management.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.544
Some folks in town
said that they saw you

30:47.546 --> 30:50.581
ridin' a green KLX motorbike.

30:51.383 --> 30:52.249
Is that true?

30:53.552 --> 30:55.118
- I don't own a motorbike.

30:56.255 --> 31:00.290
- We found it on a road
near some dead horses,

31:00.292 --> 31:03.961
mustangs, near Ana reservation.

31:04.897 --> 31:06.096
- I work up near there.

31:08.934 --> 31:12.536
- We find out that you been
ridin' that kind of bike,

31:12.538 --> 31:14.137
lotta people in the
sheriff's office

31:14.139 --> 31:16.340
are gonna be very
interested in seeing you.

31:22.882 --> 31:26.250
- All right, gimme
a few minutes.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.150
- Yeah.

32:07.359 --> 32:08.809
Name's Collins.

32:08.810 --> 32:10.260
- You get a call from
a neighbor again?

32:14.633 --> 32:18.335
- We found some dead
horses not too far from here,

32:19.305 --> 32:20.304
near Ana Reservoir.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.207
- Ranchers?

32:24.209 --> 32:28.211
- Probably hired some
kids to do it most likely.

32:32.651 --> 32:33.951
You know this guy?

32:35.354 --> 32:37.421
Said he worked for you.

32:46.732 --> 32:47.631
- Yeah.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.133
He's runnin' late.

32:53.372 --> 32:54.404
Better get to it.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.342
Kids, huh?

32:58.344 --> 32:59.443
- Yeah.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.212
Well, take care.

33:20.265 --> 33:22.299
- How much did them
ranchers offer you?

33:25.070 --> 33:25.736
- Nothing.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.507
- My guess is that
there was a few of you.

33:32.277 --> 33:34.745
Somethin' happened,
they took off.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.185
You scrub out that trough.

33:43.389 --> 33:44.521
I'll finish this.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.551
- You're the last person
I expected to see.

34:14.553 --> 34:15.452
How you been?

34:18.757 --> 34:20.424
- Can I borrow a car?

34:25.397 --> 34:27.130
- Who's ridin' this one?

34:35.340 --> 34:38.542
Thought you didn't
drive anymore.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.815
Come on then, killer.

35:47.212 --> 35:50.714
- Have you spent time in
detention as a juvenile?

35:56.788 --> 35:57.888
Private!

35:59.324 --> 36:02.859
There's gonna be an
investigation into this.

36:35.494 --> 36:38.228
- Woo!

36:39.831 --> 36:41.631
You in a hurry?

36:41.633 --> 36:43.567
Where you off to, Daytona?

37:03.522 --> 37:04.621
- Do you want a job?

37:08.827 --> 37:10.493
- I already got a job.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.229
- No, I mean
workin' with horses.

37:13.532 --> 37:15.999
I need a hand with the feedin'
and doin' some odd jobs.

37:17.536 --> 37:18.868
- Do I get to ride 'em?

37:18.870 --> 37:20.303
- You get to work.

37:20.305 --> 37:23.640
You get to doin' that
well, then we can talk.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.478
- How much?

37:29.348 --> 37:30.247
- Not much.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.434
- 15?

37:34.435 --> 37:36.418
- 10 bucks to start, and
all the fresh air you want.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.323
You know where to find me.

37:40.993 --> 37:43.426
Tomorrow mornin', six a.m.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.640
- Where the hell you been?

39:03.642 --> 39:06.743
- Tom, you know I
don't like that cussin'.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.044
- I better not find
you been workin'

39:08.046 --> 39:09.779
for one of my clients.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.782
If I find you've
been screwin' me.

39:14.786 --> 39:15.752
- Tom!

39:15.754 --> 39:17.787
- Screwin' ain't a cuss word!

39:20.125 --> 39:21.024
Who's it for?

39:21.960 --> 39:23.126
Interesting.

39:24.696 --> 39:25.895
He need any paintin' done?

39:25.897 --> 39:27.364
I'll come by and talk to him.

39:27.366 --> 39:28.598
- He doesn't need you.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.467
- Oh, we'll see, we will see.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.669
- Nobody wants you to
come around leechin'.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.771
- Hey!
- Callin' me a leech?

39:34.773 --> 39:35.772
Huh?
- What'd I say?

39:38.777 --> 39:40.643
You livin' under my
roof, I don't wanna hear

39:40.645 --> 39:41.845
any goddamn cussin'.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.581
That goes for you, too.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.882
Wipe that smirk off your face.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.650
- Don't you be
comin' back drunk.

39:47.652 --> 39:49.753
- What's
he gonna be givin',

39:49.755 --> 39:51.121
relationship tips next?
- I mean it.

39:51.123 --> 39:52.422
- Hey!

39:52.424 --> 39:54.591
- Don't keep
drinkin' and drivin'!

39:55.694 --> 39:58.561
- Tom runs a business.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.096
You don't need to
worry about him.

40:00.098 --> 40:03.133
- That's right, you're
talkin' to an entrepreneur.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.169
- Can you even spell that?

40:06.171 --> 40:07.437
- Oh you should talk.

40:07.439 --> 40:08.671
- Yeah.

40:08.673 --> 40:10.140
- At least I'm not cheap.

40:11.176 --> 40:12.809
- Who you callin' cheap?

40:12.811 --> 40:14.677
Who you callin' cheap?

40:15.881 --> 40:17.514
You think just because you
were in the military, huh?

40:17.516 --> 40:19.682
Ooh, he had to
work for a livin'.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.454
You know what, ever
since you come back

40:24.456 --> 40:26.122
every time I ask you to
borrow just a little bit

40:26.124 --> 40:27.924
of money, you make me
feel like I am this small.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.559
You are livin' in my house

40:29.561 --> 40:31.861
and I haven't seen
any rent money.

40:31.863 --> 40:32.762
Shut up!

40:35.834 --> 40:37.467
Son of a bitch.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.636
- I was supposed to
be goin' out to see--

40:39.638 --> 40:41.738
- Hey.
- Hey!

40:41.740 --> 40:42.839
Here!

40:45.043 --> 40:46.810
Here, take it.

40:48.747 --> 40:49.579
Here.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.615
- Go ahead, grab your purse.

40:52.617 --> 40:55.518
We ain't lettin' this little
shit spoil our evenin'.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.929
- Here she goes, see
what happens now.

41:05.931 --> 41:07.630
Oh, she's off again.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.499
- She's lettin' me on
this side a little better.

41:13.772 --> 41:14.905
- J.C., this is Matt.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.039
Matt helps us out
with the horses.

41:16.041 --> 41:16.873
- Nice to meet ya.

41:16.875 --> 41:17.807
- Nice to meet you, too.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.075
- What do you think, Matt,

41:19.077 --> 41:20.844
think we can make a
cowboy of J.C. yet?

41:20.846 --> 41:23.913
- I think it'd be good to
have some help around here.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.515
- Show him how to do it.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.818
- She's a little tricky today.

42:03.054 --> 42:03.920
- Hey.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.156
Let's go for a ride.

42:07.158 --> 42:08.525
- All right.

42:08.527 --> 42:09.192
- Here ya go.

42:13.765 --> 42:14.664
Here.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.799
Mount up and follow me.

42:54.105 --> 42:55.038
Grab those.

43:01.846 --> 43:05.682
Spread 'em out over
there on the bench.

43:13.158 --> 43:15.825
Why'd they discharge
you from the military?

43:16.962 --> 43:18.795
- Fighting.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.863
- Thought that's what
they paid you for.

43:22.267 --> 43:23.333
- Not your own men.

43:32.978 --> 43:34.043
- Come on, get up.

43:36.181 --> 43:38.948
- Won't be workin'
in the afternoons anymore.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.785
I'm sleepin' in the afternoons.

44:00.271 --> 44:03.406
- Shittin' ass brother.

44:45.950 --> 44:48.918
- Gettin' a
little headway.

45:37.202 --> 45:38.935
- Woo!

45:38.937 --> 45:40.770
- Feel good?

45:40.772 --> 45:42.371
- Yeah.

45:42.373 --> 45:43.806
- Little steps.

45:48.513 --> 45:50.847
- Is it always that easy?

46:11.136 --> 46:13.202
- He's been started before.

46:13.204 --> 46:16.205
He likes to trust
people, he's got a past.

46:16.207 --> 46:19.876
You want his respect, you're
not gonna get that by quittin'.

46:19.878 --> 46:20.777
Go again.

46:34.325 --> 46:37.160
Okay just, now, I want
you to turn side onto him.

46:37.162 --> 46:40.229
Stop, just stop,
just stop, stop.

46:40.231 --> 46:42.064
See, look, he's
curious, he's comin' in.

46:42.066 --> 46:42.999
He's comin' in.

46:43.001 --> 46:44.133
Just stay still, stay still.

46:49.874 --> 46:53.242
Give him some attention,
then just walk away.

46:57.582 --> 46:58.981
It's not about winning.

47:00.819 --> 47:02.985
It's about gettin' a
partnership with him.

47:03.922 --> 47:04.987
Let him come to you.

47:07.091 --> 47:08.925
Look at that!

47:08.927 --> 47:10.092
Look at that, eh?

47:14.165 --> 47:15.748
You earned his trust.

47:15.749 --> 47:17.332
You didn't get it by
quittin', good boy.

47:30.548 --> 47:33.850
- You better take care of this.

47:45.363 --> 47:50.366
- He was such a sweet kid,
easy, wouldn't even cry.

47:51.603 --> 47:53.336
I don't know, I just,

47:54.873 --> 47:57.273
I thought, ya know,
that the military

47:57.275 --> 47:58.541
woulda straightened him out.

48:00.044 --> 48:00.943
You have kids?

48:02.513 --> 48:06.148
- My wife and I were,
we never got that lucky.

48:07.585 --> 48:09.252
- First time you hold 'em...

48:15.093 --> 48:17.293
You don't plan for the rest.

48:19.163 --> 48:23.933
- Linda, does J.C. know
how to ride a motorbike?

48:23.935 --> 48:25.134
- Him and his brothers

48:25.136 --> 48:27.169
been ridin' their whole lives.

48:27.171 --> 48:29.438
Dirt bikes, stock cars.

48:30.942 --> 48:33.009
In fact he was ridin'
a bike last month.

48:34.579 --> 48:35.578
- Was it green?

48:36.981 --> 48:40.249
- Yeah, one of Harris's I think.

49:12.283 --> 49:13.382
- You wanna eat?

49:20.258 --> 49:23.392
What do you think
about helpin' me out?

49:28.633 --> 49:29.565
Run the farm.

49:31.169 --> 49:32.368
- What do you
think I been doin'?

49:32.370 --> 49:34.303
- No, I mean like, runnin' it.

49:36.007 --> 49:38.507
Let me tell ya how I
came to get this ranch.

49:40.044 --> 49:44.380
There was this old timer,
he just left it to me.

49:45.750 --> 49:48.184
It was just a weed patch.

49:48.186 --> 49:50.052
All the buildings
were fallin' down.

49:51.522 --> 49:54.557
We didn't have any phones
with cameras back then,

49:54.559 --> 49:57.760
so we only took pictures

50:01.299 --> 50:05.167
intended to be for
somethin' special.

50:07.238 --> 50:08.137
Yeah.

50:10.541 --> 50:12.074
There it is, that's it.

50:16.280 --> 50:19.548
I was as skinny as a whip
back then.

50:19.550 --> 50:24.620
So, why do you think he
let this place fall apart?

50:26.457 --> 50:27.356
- I don't know.

50:29.193 --> 50:31.160
- 'Cause he had no
one to leave it to.

50:32.296 --> 50:34.463
He had no family, he had
no kids, he had nobody.

50:35.366 --> 50:40.436
He just let all his
hard work go to waste.

50:47.278 --> 50:48.878
That's him.

50:48.879 --> 50:50.479
His skin's like worn
out old leather,

50:50.481 --> 50:52.448
hands are like
shovels, all dried out.

50:54.185 --> 50:57.520
If it wasn't for him I don't
think I would still be here.

51:03.094 --> 51:08.130
He never said much, but when
he did it was just slander.

51:12.303 --> 51:13.569
- So why are you helpin' me?

51:15.273 --> 51:17.373
- 'Cause I got all
this and I got nobody.

51:19.210 --> 51:20.676
I got no one to leave it to.

51:22.246 --> 51:24.613
- What about that boy in the
picture in the other room?

51:28.453 --> 51:30.219
- I can give
you a ride home.

51:44.135 --> 51:45.401
- Just can't believe
Harris would do--

51:45.403 --> 51:46.869
- Honey,
who's at the door?

51:50.875 --> 51:52.775
- It's been nice seein' ya
again, Lauren, thank you.

51:53.845 --> 51:55.244
- Thanks for comin' by.

52:45.463 --> 52:47.830
- You got the balls to
snitch on your brother?

52:50.501 --> 52:52.301
What the hell were
the sheriffs doin'

52:52.303 --> 52:54.170
over at my house, J.C.?

52:55.339 --> 52:57.773
What were the sheriffs doin'?

52:57.775 --> 53:01.310
- Hey!

53:01.312 --> 53:03.746
- I didn't say anything.

53:05.750 --> 53:08.284
- Go on.
- Get the fuck off of me.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.560
- Come on.

53:20.464 --> 53:22.865
- Shoulda never came back here.

53:22.867 --> 53:23.799
I got nothin'.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.455
- It's warm.

53:57.835 --> 54:01.670
I know a guy up in Stenson
runs a construction company.

54:03.741 --> 54:04.640
- Stenson?

54:05.876 --> 54:06.775
- Ah!

54:08.246 --> 54:08.911
California?

54:12.550 --> 54:15.584
You won't make much,
but get ya outta here.

54:17.688 --> 54:19.421
- I actually like
what I'm doin'.

54:19.423 --> 54:20.723
- With the horses?

54:21.626 --> 54:23.325
- Yeah, I like it
more than money.

54:23.995 --> 54:25.294
I got a horse now.

54:28.833 --> 54:32.334
They got problems, just like us.

54:34.705 --> 54:36.438
- You make a livin' off that?

54:42.580 --> 54:44.513
Can I come see it?

54:44.515 --> 54:45.914
- The horse?

54:45.916 --> 54:46.882
- Tomorrow.

54:50.755 --> 54:52.721
- I'll think about it.

55:15.813 --> 55:18.814
- That's it.

55:20.584 --> 55:21.684
Go on.

55:50.648 --> 55:51.714
- Are you serious?

55:51.716 --> 55:52.915
- How long's this gonna take?

55:52.917 --> 55:54.783
- As long as it takes.

55:54.785 --> 55:56.885
- I'll just stay here
and listen to the radio.

55:56.887 --> 55:58.053
- No, you'll drain my battery.

55:58.055 --> 56:00.422
- What else am I supposed to do?

56:01.592 --> 56:03.058
Go on, get this

56:03.059 --> 56:04.525
over with, I'm bored.
- Why are you always drunk?

56:06.464 --> 56:07.796
- This is it, huh?

56:12.103 --> 56:14.770
Nice lick of paint on
this house right here,

56:16.507 --> 56:17.806
she'll look brand new.

56:17.808 --> 56:18.741
- Who are you?

56:18.743 --> 56:22.845
- Tom, J.C.'s brother.

56:22.847 --> 56:24.680
I run a paintin' company.

56:25.883 --> 56:27.483
- You got a business card?

56:33.624 --> 56:36.525
Let me guess, you run out.

56:38.095 --> 56:40.129
Well, no matter.

56:40.131 --> 56:42.464
J.C. can give me all
your information.

56:45.102 --> 56:46.068
Thanks for comin'.

57:10.861 --> 57:12.728
- When can I expect
your room and board?

57:12.730 --> 57:14.062
- I already gave it to you.

57:14.064 --> 57:14.830
- When?

57:14.832 --> 57:16.148
I haven't seen it.

57:16.149 --> 57:17.465
- I been puttin'
it on your dresser.

57:17.468 --> 57:19.902
- Yeah, don't listen
to him, he's a liar.

57:20.671 --> 57:22.004
- I don't get my room and board,

57:22.006 --> 57:24.006
you're not comin'
back into my house.

57:26.744 --> 57:28.210
I didn't raise you to be a liar!

57:39.824 --> 57:42.825
- Your family doesn't
seem to like you, J.C.

57:42.827 --> 57:44.827
- That's family, though.

57:44.829 --> 57:47.996
- You're not tied to someone
because you share a bloodline.

57:47.998 --> 57:52.000
Be respectful, but it's
not a life sentence.

57:53.537 --> 57:56.538
- She won't remember what
she said by tomorrow.

57:56.540 --> 57:58.106
- Look, just stay here.

57:59.210 --> 58:01.076
She needs money,
so she needs you.

58:01.078 --> 58:03.145
Makes you dependent.
- I'm not a horse.

58:04.482 --> 58:05.881
Who are you to tell me?

58:05.883 --> 58:06.782
- I've lived it.

58:07.852 --> 58:09.051
- It was a hundred bucks.

58:09.053 --> 58:10.886
- Yeah, for 10 hours
that you worked.

58:10.888 --> 58:12.921
It's simple, just stay here.

58:12.923 --> 58:15.374
I won't charge you for anything.

58:15.375 --> 58:17.826
And you listen to me, kid,
I'm givin' you good advice.

58:17.828 --> 58:18.727
- Advice?

58:19.530 --> 58:20.929
Who are you to tell me?

58:22.800 --> 58:23.699
- I'm sorry?

58:26.103 --> 58:28.136
- You can't even take
care of your own.

58:29.974 --> 58:31.206
- You get out.

58:43.954 --> 58:45.020
Wait up.

58:46.056 --> 58:47.856
- Is that why your
family left you?

58:50.928 --> 58:53.862
- Don't you ever confuse
kindness with weakness.

58:54.832 --> 58:55.898
Now get off my land.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.889
- Ya know, paintin'
ain't that bad.

01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:28.991
You know that, right?

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.377
- Yeah.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:53.882
Look at the place.

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:57.285
- How's it goin'?

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:59.321
- Well, we got some
walls to do in here.

01:01:07.398 --> 01:01:09.998
Now the walls need
to be cleaned.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.067
Gotta be clean.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:13.735
- Yeah, we got it.

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:14.970
Clean.
- We gotta do somethin'

01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:16.705
with the ceiling
tiles there, too.

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:19.107
- Same color?

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:21.326
Si, Jose.

01:01:21.327 --> 01:01:22.710
Unload the.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.080
Oh, J.C.?

01:01:34.091 --> 01:01:37.092
- This guy is a clown.

01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:42.164
- Complete clown.

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:15.230
- Can I get this case of beer?

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:20.202
- $10.59.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:16.825
- Where are you goin'?

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:17.526
- Out.

01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:21.096
- Showin' houses again, huh?

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:24.099
- More than you'll be doin'
by the looks of things.

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:28.837
So'd they settle up with ya?

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.809
- I can get you room
and board next week.

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:41.316
- Where are the keys?

01:03:43.086 --> 01:03:44.352
- They're in the truck.

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:45.520
- Food's on the table.

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:35.904
- You ever seen a horse kick?

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:38.373
I mean really
kick, for its life.

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:45.247
It can kick right
through a two-inch board,

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:47.616
break it in half.

01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:01.280
See,

01:05:01.281 --> 01:05:02.364
in the fall three years ago

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:08.570
my wife and I were
up on the ridge

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.105
lookin' for lost cattle.

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:14.976
We'd been up for about 30 hours.

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:17.579
We came across this ravine.

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:25.320
My wife, she points
out down to the bottom

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.658
a horse trapped in the mud.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:37.966
She pops off her horse
like a box spring

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:41.937
and races down to it,

01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:45.340
mud up around her ankles.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.577
I raced down after her,

01:05:54.184 --> 01:05:55.517
but before I can get to her

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.987
the horse starts buckin'.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:07.462
He catches her right
upside the head.

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.039
She survived.

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:23.445
They kept her for a few
weeks in the hospital.

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:28.984
I knew that she'd never
be the same again.

01:06:33.457 --> 01:06:37.359
She was gettin' these
terrible nightmares

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:42.364
where she'd be ragin' and
screamin', wakin' up the kids.

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:51.373
We fought sometimes.

01:06:55.045 --> 01:06:55.744
Physically.

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:09.457
- Where is she now?

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:17.265
- She was plannin' on
movin' up to her sister's.

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:29.127
It's further up north.

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:30.811
They were headed out
of town on Highway 20,

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:37.519
when your car ran
into them, racin'.

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:27.569
- Lauren, open the door.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.107
Lauren, please open the door.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:52.527
- Let me get
two of them slaw dogs.

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:01.636
- Everything's gone to
hell since you came back.

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:05.305
- You deserve it.

01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:13.648
- Now it's my turn to
take something from you.

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:26.321
- Finch,
where are the horses?

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:27.388
The gate's unlocked.

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:30.692
- J.C., J.C.!

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.296
J.C.!

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:10.498
J.C., Jesus.

01:11:11.635 --> 01:11:15.336
Gimme that, gimme
that, gimme that.

01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:39.694
Go.

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:43.698
Let me do this, son.

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:47.468
Go.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:48.636
Go.

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:49.771
Go, get out!

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:33.614
- Uncle Tommy there?

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:35.750
- He's in the back.

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:38.686
- I just need a place to crash.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:41.756
- He doesn't wanna
come to the phone right now.

01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:44.492
He said you should
stay with your mom.

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:27.161
- We got a
lot of horses to work

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:28.696
and a short period
of time to do it,

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:31.032
so there's not gonna
be a lot of time off.

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:34.602
I don't have a whole
lot to offer ya.

01:14:34.604 --> 01:14:36.571
You know, it's up to
you if you're willin'

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:39.874
to sign on and try
to make this work.

01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:43.211
- Would I be workin' with
horses every day, or?

01:14:43.213 --> 01:14:44.479
- Every day.

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:35.923
- As your counselor
probably told you,

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.792
I run a horse
rehabilitation program

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:41.095
just outside of town here.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.296
I know exactly
what it feels like

01:16:42.298 --> 01:16:44.031
to be where you're
sitting today.

01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:47.868
My dad left when
I was really young

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.937
and I didn't respond
very well either.

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:57.278
I got into all sorts
of things, racing cars,

01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.146
any way to lash out.

01:17:01.884 --> 01:17:04.085
And eventually I
got in a car crash.

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:11.025
I know you're angry.

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:17.031
After I was discharged
from the military

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:20.234
I came back home and
I got a job on a ranch

01:17:21.738 --> 01:17:23.104
workin' with wild horses.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.375
It taught me a lot,
a lot about myself.

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:30.077
More than I learned about them.

01:17:31.748 --> 01:17:33.981
I don't know, if you're
lookin' for somethin' to do,

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:36.150
maybe even learn
somethin' about yourself,

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:39.387
I'd love to have ya.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:44.358
Your counselor can give
you my information.

01:19:52.789 --> 01:19:53.487
- It's for you.

01:20:22.285 --> 01:20:23.217
What's it say?

01:20:33.429 --> 01:20:35.196
- It mentions you.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.066
Is Finch gonna be okay?

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:43.037
- He didn't do anything wrong.

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.475
- Do you know who he is, Finch?

01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:56.150
- I saw him at your court
hearing after the incident.

01:20:58.588 --> 01:21:00.120
He just sat in the corner.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:05.626
He was sad, didn't move.

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:11.198
- How do you repay
someone like that?

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:19.273
- You're doin' it.

01:21:30.286 --> 01:21:32.453
He came and visited
me at the hospital.

01:21:35.658 --> 01:21:36.657
He gave me time.

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:46.200
And I don't wanna
waste any more.

01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:51.105
Ever.

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:55.142
- Me either.

01:22:00.616 --> 01:22:02.316
- I'm glad you did it.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:05.519
- You cleaned up nice.

01:22:08.024 --> 01:22:10.291
- They did
it at the hospital.

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:25.472
- Come on.

01:22:40.156 --> 01:22:41.221
- This is Grace.

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:45.025
- Harris.

01:22:45.027 --> 01:22:47.194
- He's my brother.
