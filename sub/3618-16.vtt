WEBVTT

00:03.657 --> 00:06.137
Interesting.

00:06.777 --> 00:08.777
Are you okay in there?

00:09.818 --> 00:13.218
I don't remember having morning
sickness this bad with Wyatt.

00:13.538 --> 00:16.178
Oh, honey, that sucks.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.399
I'm just going over some
pictures here,

00:19.499 --> 00:24.099
trying to educate myself
before I go to Phoebe's reunion.

00:24.499 --> 00:27.499
Todd Marks.
I wonder if he's still even alive.

00:27.859 --> 00:30.560
Alive? What kind of school
did she go to anyway?

00:30.660 --> 00:32.080
Not a bad one, actually.

00:32.180 --> 00:35.540
It's just that Phoebe tended
to hang out with the bad-boy crowd.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.641
You know, anything to piss off Grams.

00:37.741 --> 00:42.301
- Was he her first love?
- More like first lust.

00:43.461 --> 00:45.601
Talk about crazy, though.

00:45.701 --> 00:48.942
Rick Gittridge. He was kind of
the leader of their little gang.

00:49.302 --> 00:51.442
- Phoebe was in a gang?
- Not the drive-by kind.

00:51.542 --> 00:54.362
But he was kind of the type.

00:54.462 --> 00:56.583
If he's at the reunion,
I'd stay away from him.

00:57.503 --> 00:59.003
This is so weird.

00:59.103 --> 01:01.243
It's a whole different side
of Miss Phoebe.

01:01.343 --> 01:04.903
I think she missed Mom in her life
more than Prue or I did.

01:05.263 --> 01:09.184
And the more Grams tried to control
her, the more she became rebellious.

01:11.104 --> 01:13.444
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:13.544 --> 01:14.965
- What happened?
- What happened?

01:15.065 --> 01:19.185
The dry cleaner ruined my dress
for tonight, that's what happened.

01:19.585 --> 01:22.125
Phoebe, you know better than
to scream in this house

01:22.225 --> 01:23.765
if there isn't a demon.

01:23.865 --> 01:26.806
I'm sorry, but what am I supposed to
wear to the reunion tonight?

01:26.906 --> 01:28.846
How about some prison stripes?

01:28.946 --> 01:30.486
You told her about the shoplifting?

01:30.586 --> 01:32.966
- You little thief.
- No, I acted out.

01:33.066 --> 01:35.167
Now, back to what
I'm supposed to wear tonight.

01:35.267 --> 01:37.327
I know, why don't you try your
little black suit,

01:37.427 --> 01:39.527
the one with the thigh slit?
Sexy, yet successful.

01:39.627 --> 01:42.788
No, I think black is too threatening.
I'll be in my closet.

01:46.348 --> 01:47.968
- Chris, hi.
- Hey.

01:48.068 --> 01:50.428
Look, I need your help.
I think I got scabbers on my tail.

01:51.828 --> 01:55.349
Oh, well, I have some
hydrogen peroxide in my bathroom.

01:55.709 --> 01:57.089
No, scabber demons.

01:57.189 --> 01:59.449
I went undercover to follow
a lead on who turns Wyatt,

01:59.549 --> 02:00.769
but I think they're on to me.

02:00.869 --> 02:03.430
<i>I need a cloaking spell, just in case.</i>
<i>Is the Book in the attic?</i>

02:03.750 --> 02:05.750
Yeah, the last I saw.

02:06.110 --> 02:08.110
Want me to help you?

02:09.550 --> 02:11.871
- He hates me.
- No, he doesn't.

02:12.191 --> 02:14.191
Yeah, he does.

02:16.631 --> 02:21.632
He's just distracted, that's all,
by, you know, imminent death.

02:22.032 --> 02:23.812
That's no excuse.

02:23.912 --> 02:26.912
I mean, he's been avoiding me
for weeks. He won't even look at me.

02:27.232 --> 02:29.673
What could I have done in the future
that would be so bad?

02:29.993 --> 02:32.753
Maybe he should have
a father-son talk.

02:33.073 --> 02:34.413
No, I can't do that to Leo.

02:34.513 --> 02:37.093
He had a hard enough time
letting go.

02:37.193 --> 02:38.894
Besides, he doesn't know
I'm pregnant.

02:38.994 --> 02:41.014
I know, but don't boys need their?

02:41.114 --> 02:42.854
I know, and that's why
I called my father,

02:42.954 --> 02:46.474
so he could figure out why
his surly new grandson hates me.

02:52.475 --> 02:54.135
I got you.

02:54.235 --> 02:56.235
Guys, how about this one?

02:57.556 --> 02:59.556
Okay.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.337
I remember this poem.

03:07.437 --> 03:11.517
<i>Those who mock who I am</i>
<i>Let them always remember when</i>

04:49.248 --> 04:50.988
- Hi.
- Piper.

04:51.088 --> 04:53.548
- Honey, good to see you.
- Good to see you.

04:53.648 --> 04:55.948
All of you. Look, you're pregnant.

04:56.048 --> 04:58.349
Yeah, it looks that way, huh?

04:58.449 --> 04:59.709
When did this happen?

04:59.809 --> 05:03.289
Oh, well, you know, I've been meaning
to call you, but, you know...

05:03.609 --> 05:04.909
Leo is the father.

05:05.009 --> 05:07.310
Leo? I thought you guys split up.

05:07.410 --> 05:08.750
We did.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.550
Well, then how did?

05:10.650 --> 05:11.830
I don't understand.

05:11.930 --> 05:15.050
He was dying and I was crying...

05:15.370 --> 05:17.371
It's all very complicated.

05:19.011 --> 05:22.771
So, Leo, he's... moved on?

05:23.171 --> 05:26.812
Yeah, but I'm happy for him.
He really wanted to go.

05:27.172 --> 05:30.232
- He wanted to die?
- No, no, no. He's not dead.

05:30.332 --> 05:33.092
He's just up there
being a full-time Elder.

05:33.412 --> 05:34.712
He doesn't know about this?

05:34.812 --> 05:37.253
No, no, not yet.

05:37.613 --> 05:39.613
Did I mention this was all
very complicated?

05:39.973 --> 05:41.973
The point is, he's not around.

05:42.573 --> 05:44.614
- Was he ever?
- Were you?

05:45.854 --> 05:48.394
- Sorry.
- No, no, no, I deserve that.

05:48.494 --> 05:50.194
I wasn't around enough for you girls.

05:50.294 --> 05:51.554
But...

05:51.654 --> 05:54.935
I want to make up for that
with Wyatt and his little...

05:55.295 --> 05:57.595
It's a boy. Chris, actually.

05:57.695 --> 05:59.355
Chris?
Why did you choose that name?

05:59.455 --> 06:01.395
I don't know and he won't tell me.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.516
He's very secretive about the future.

06:03.616 --> 06:05.676
He's actually the reason
I asked you to come.

06:05.776 --> 06:07.716
See, he hates me

06:07.816 --> 06:10.856
and he doesn't want to talk to me,
and I need you to find out why.

06:11.816 --> 06:14.377
I don't understand
your Wiccan ways.

06:14.697 --> 06:16.697
But I'll try.

06:17.497 --> 06:19.837
Hello, Chris. Chris?

06:19.937 --> 06:22.278
Hello, Chris. Can you hear me?

06:22.378 --> 06:24.118
Someone calling me?

06:24.218 --> 06:26.278
Yeah. Sweetie,
could you come here a sec?

06:26.378 --> 06:28.378
Jeez, he can come out?

06:28.898 --> 06:31.579
Can we hurry this up
because I gotta get...

06:31.899 --> 06:33.899
Grandpa.

06:45.740 --> 06:47.280
Okay, Paige, I should warn you.

06:47.380 --> 06:50.461
There's gonna be a lot of people
in there that used to hate me.

06:50.781 --> 06:52.241
They're not gonna hate you.

06:52.341 --> 06:56.181
San Francisco reads your paper
every day and they love you.

06:56.501 --> 06:59.502
I never dropped smoke bombs
on San Francisco.

06:59.902 --> 07:02.082
Pep rallies, I hated them.

07:02.182 --> 07:04.522
All right. Well, after we're done tonight,

07:04.622 --> 07:07.562
they're gonna rename the gym
just for you.

07:07.662 --> 07:09.663
Come on, conquering hero.

07:16.023 --> 07:17.364
Phoebe.

07:17.464 --> 07:21.104
- Hi. Wow, you look great.
- Really? Thanks.

07:21.464 --> 07:23.824
- Well, see you inside.
- Yeah. That would be great.

07:26.024 --> 07:28.085
- Who was that?
- I have no idea.

07:28.185 --> 07:30.625
Well, I didn't expect to see you here,
Miss Halliwell.

07:30.945 --> 07:33.745
Still testing the boundaries
of the criminal justice system, are we?

07:34.065 --> 07:37.426
Hi, Miss Hickock.
No, actually, I'm a columnist now.

07:39.106 --> 07:41.106
I give advice.

07:41.746 --> 07:43.606
On relationships.

07:43.706 --> 07:45.087
I'm sorry, dear.

07:45.187 --> 07:47.627
I just never figured you
for the advice-giving type.

07:47.947 --> 07:49.947
You certainly never took it.

07:52.067 --> 07:54.067
Enjoy.

07:55.988 --> 07:57.168
Gym teacher?

07:57.268 --> 07:59.828
How did you know
she was a gym teacher?

08:00.668 --> 08:02.888
All right, lady, let's go in there.

08:02.988 --> 08:05.989
- Show your sordid past a thing or two.
- Yes.

08:23.391 --> 08:25.131
Oh, my God,
everybody's looking at me.

08:25.231 --> 08:26.971
Yeah, that's because
you're a celebrity

08:27.071 --> 08:29.971
and you look fabulous
and they probably all want to be you.

08:30.071 --> 08:32.772
Nice try. I'm an empath, I feel hate.

08:32.871 --> 08:35.812
Phoebe. Phoebe Halliwell.
I can't believe you showed up.

08:35.912 --> 08:38.532
- Ramona. Hi.
- You're so skinny.

08:38.631 --> 08:41.253
How'd you stay so skinny?
Who's this?

08:41.352 --> 08:44.793
I'm Paige Matthews,
her long lost sister.

08:45.153 --> 08:47.093
Oh, wow, are you famous too?

08:47.193 --> 08:49.293
You look famous. Okay, so,

08:49.393 --> 08:54.194
dweeb time, but, since I knew you
when, can I have your autograph?

08:54.594 --> 08:58.034
Oh, yeah, of course.
I usually charge $20 for it.

08:58.594 --> 09:00.375
I think I have a 20 here somewhere.

09:00.475 --> 09:02.475
No, I'm kidding.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.415
I used to do everything Phoebe said.

09:06.515 --> 09:08.976
Remember that night when
you snuck me into the country club

09:09.076 --> 09:10.576
in the trunk of your car?

09:10.676 --> 09:11.856
And then you left me there

09:11.956 --> 09:14.436
so that you could go make out
with Todd on the golf course?

09:14.756 --> 09:16.776
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

09:16.876 --> 09:20.757
Actually, I'm sorry about a lot
of the tricks we used to play on you.

09:21.117 --> 09:23.177
Tricks?

09:23.277 --> 09:25.937
You made me feel like
part of the gang.

09:26.037 --> 09:28.038
Those were the best times
of my life.

09:29.238 --> 09:32.138
So I think you need to tell me more
about this gang.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.498
What else did she do?

09:33.598 --> 09:35.978
One time she broke into
the principal's office,

09:36.078 --> 09:38.439
just to make out with some guy
on his desk.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.759
See, now, I remember that it was you
that broke into the principal's office

09:44.119 --> 09:46.320
and I just tagged along out of curiosity.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.680
- Where's Paula?
- She's around, somewhere.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.860
This is so awesome.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.321
It's like the gang's all
back together again. Well, almost.

09:55.641 --> 09:57.141
Oh, yeah. Where's the ringleader?

09:57.241 --> 09:59.681
Rick, good old Rick. Where is Rick?

10:00.481 --> 10:02.521
I heard he got picked up
for a liquor-store robbery.

10:03.201 --> 10:05.282
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
Did he do it?

10:05.602 --> 10:08.322
I only know what I read in your paper
and I read everything you write.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.982
Thanks. I'm flattered.

10:11.082 --> 10:14.963
- So, what are you doing now?
- I'm a personal-injury lawyer.

10:16.723 --> 10:18.103
That sounds interesting.

10:18.203 --> 10:19.903
Well, it's not.

10:20.003 --> 10:22.303
But it's legal, just barely.

10:22.403 --> 10:24.404
It pays the mortgage.

10:24.964 --> 10:27.104
I miss the fun we used to have.

10:27.204 --> 10:29.244
Yeah, me too.

10:29.884 --> 10:33.165
Todd. There you are, sweetie.

10:35.005 --> 10:36.585
Oh, and there you are.

10:36.685 --> 10:38.685
I was wondering if
you had the nerve to show up.

10:39.685 --> 10:42.286
- What do you mean, "nerve"?
- Oh, you're the talk of the reunion.

10:42.606 --> 10:45.066
You know, you can fool San Francisco
with your pithy advice,

10:45.166 --> 10:47.166
but you can't fool us.

10:48.006 --> 10:49.586
We all know you, sweetie.

10:49.686 --> 10:51.587
- That's enough.
- What does that mean?

10:51.687 --> 10:53.547
It means you're a fake.

10:53.647 --> 10:55.547
The only thing you
were ever known for

10:55.647 --> 10:57.807
was lying and ditching
and stealing boyfriends.

10:59.047 --> 11:00.428
Phoebe, are you gonna let
somebody

11:00.528 --> 11:03.008
with a giant helmet that passes
for hair talk to you like that?

11:03.328 --> 11:06.568
God, Paula, just because
Todd had a thing for Phoebe,

11:06.928 --> 11:08.188
you don't have to be so mean.

11:08.288 --> 11:10.889
I'm not being mean,
I'm doing her a favour.

11:11.209 --> 11:14.429
To the rest of the world,
you might be "Ask Phoebe,"

11:14.529 --> 11:17.889
but to us, you'll always be Freebie.

11:21.530 --> 11:23.530
You okay?

11:27.930 --> 11:30.111
Hey.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.211
Let's dance.

11:34.771 --> 11:38.372
Hey, why didn't you just tell that chick
to go screw herself?

11:40.572 --> 11:41.992
Phoebe?

11:42.092 --> 11:44.152
Okay, what just happened?

11:44.252 --> 11:45.552
- You tell me.
- I have no idea.

11:45.652 --> 11:49.533
I was just standing here, and then I
had some weird high school flashback.

11:49.933 --> 11:52.273
Yeah, your whole body
just flashed back.

11:52.373 --> 11:53.753
What, are you kidding me?

11:53.853 --> 11:55.953
- I just felt...
- Pissed?

11:56.053 --> 11:59.154
<i>- Very.</i>
<i>- Well, as someone who's seen Carrie,</i>

11:59.254 --> 12:01.814
both versions,
I'd say the reunion is over.

12:05.815 --> 12:07.395
So we're close?

12:07.495 --> 12:09.435
Yeah. You're awesome, Grandpa.

12:09.535 --> 12:11.275
Did you hear that?

12:11.375 --> 12:14.175
- Awesome.
- Yeah, after the event happened,

12:14.495 --> 12:16.776
- we got really close.
- What event?

12:18.136 --> 12:20.756
- I can't tell you.
- Is this event my fault?

12:20.856 --> 12:22.876
Is that why you're treating me
like a nonperson?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.117
I can't talk about it,
it'll mess with the future.

12:25.217 --> 12:27.757
But you did say I was awesome, right?
You can talk about that?

12:27.857 --> 12:30.177
Yeah. You're the best.
I love hanging out with you.

12:30.497 --> 12:33.418
I gotta admit, I'm a little surprised.
I mean,

12:33.858 --> 12:35.958
it's no secret
I wasn't the greatest dad.

12:36.058 --> 12:39.198
It means a lot to me that
I could do something to make up for it.

12:39.298 --> 12:41.278
- You do.
- After the event.

12:41.378 --> 12:43.239
- Right.
- That you won't tell me about.

12:43.339 --> 12:46.619
- I told you. I can't talk about it, okay?
- Hey.

12:46.979 --> 12:49.239
Don't talk to your mother like that,
okay?

12:49.339 --> 12:50.719
You're right.

12:50.819 --> 12:52.820
I'm sorry.

12:55.740 --> 12:57.740
Piper?

12:59.500 --> 13:00.640
Hey, what's going on?

13:00.740 --> 13:03.661
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

13:04.381 --> 13:06.361
Okay, I hate to cut this reunion short.

13:06.461 --> 13:08.361
I think you've had enough
of those for today.

13:08.461 --> 13:11.082
You go upstairs
till we figure this out.

13:11.182 --> 13:13.182
Bye, Daddy.

13:13.502 --> 13:15.502
What happened?

13:15.982 --> 13:18.542
Well, you've heard of
recapturing your youth.

13:18.862 --> 13:20.863
I think Phoebe's youth
is trying to capture her.

13:21.543 --> 13:22.723
- Explain.
- I don't know.

13:22.823 --> 13:25.463
One minute she was normal.
The next, it's like she's Freaky Phoebe.

13:25.783 --> 13:27.403
- Great, who else saw?
- No one.

13:27.503 --> 13:29.684
She changed back
before anyone noticed.

13:29.784 --> 13:31.604
I'm having a little trouble
keeping up here.

13:31.704 --> 13:34.224
Phoebe's being chased
by what, demons?

13:34.544 --> 13:36.764
Maybe inner demons
or a spell gone wrong.

13:36.864 --> 13:38.004
It seemed to happen after

13:38.104 --> 13:40.705
someone named Paula Marks
called her "Freebie."

13:41.025 --> 13:43.265
Oh, yeah, that'll do it.

13:43.585 --> 13:46.425
<i>You want to go upstairs and check</i>
<i>the Book, see if there's anything?</i>

13:46.745 --> 13:48.086
- Okay.
- You two go ahead.

13:48.186 --> 13:50.906
I need to get back to the scabber
demons before they know I'm missing.

13:51.226 --> 13:53.866
Hey, wait. What, and leave your
awesome grandpa alone?

13:54.226 --> 13:57.147
Grab a sandwich, grab a beer,
get an answer.

13:59.987 --> 14:01.987
Cubans?

14:05.027 --> 14:07.528
I am not that person anymore.

14:07.628 --> 14:10.628
I am not, so whatever you think
you're doing or...

14:17.629 --> 14:19.629
What is happening to me?

14:25.270 --> 14:27.630
Hello? This is Phoebe, I think.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.430
Hey. Where did you go?
Are you okay?

14:30.750 --> 14:33.410
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

14:33.510 --> 14:35.751
<i>Listen, I'm sorry about Paula.</i>

14:36.071 --> 14:38.631
It always burned her up.
You know, you and me together.

14:38.991 --> 14:41.431
<i>- Yeah. Hey, listen...</i>
<i>- You know, the only reason I came</i>

14:41.751 --> 14:43.752
to this thing was because of you.

14:44.752 --> 14:46.752
Hoping I'd see you again.

14:48.192 --> 14:50.292
- You there?
- Yeah.

14:50.392 --> 14:53.193
I need to ask you a question.

14:54.313 --> 14:56.313
Was I really a...

14:57.793 --> 15:01.033
A different person
when you knew me?

15:01.353 --> 15:02.854
Different?

15:02.954 --> 15:05.354
- How do you mean?
- You know, what Paula said.

15:05.674 --> 15:08.734
Phoebe, we were kids.

15:08.834 --> 15:11.014
You know, we were young,
we were dumb,

15:11.114 --> 15:12.855
<i>we didn't let anything</i>
<i>stand in our way.</i>

15:12.955 --> 15:14.415
Yeah, I remember.

15:14.515 --> 15:16.215
<i>I don't know about you, but I miss it.</i>

15:16.315 --> 15:19.915
When was the last time you were wild?
You know, really wild?

15:20.315 --> 15:23.056
<i>- The way we used to be.</i>
<i>- Actually,</i>

15:23.156 --> 15:27.916
- quite recently, to tell you the truth.
- Who is that? Who are you talking to?

15:28.276 --> 15:30.277
Is this Freebie?

15:31.077 --> 15:34.557
You bet your ass.
And I'm coming to get you, bitch.

15:51.319 --> 15:54.199
Sorry, bad idea.

15:55.279 --> 15:58.320
It's cool. It's just... It's strong.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.760
I was just trying to help us
bond a little, you know.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.660
We don't need help, we're cool.

16:02.760 --> 16:07.441
In the future. But I haven't
been there yet, you know.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.001
I'm feeling a little out of sync here.

16:11.241 --> 16:13.621
Well, you hungry?
Do you want to grab a bite?

16:13.721 --> 16:16.762
Yeah, yeah, that would be
great. Just...

16:17.082 --> 16:19.082
- Let me change first, okay?
- Okay.

16:22.402 --> 16:25.402
Listen. About those things,

16:25.723 --> 16:28.183
you might want to pick up
a different habit,

16:28.283 --> 16:30.403
to avoid any future problems,
if you know what I mean.

16:33.003 --> 16:35.264
Oh, gee.

16:35.364 --> 16:37.364
Thanks for the tip.

16:56.606 --> 16:58.606
Phoebe.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.266
Phoebe?

17:01.366 --> 17:03.607
When you said you were feeling wild,
you weren't kidding.

17:03.927 --> 17:06.607
What happened?
Your hair, your clothes...

17:08.327 --> 17:10.646
Oh, my God!

17:10.967 --> 17:12.968
Get off him.

17:14.127 --> 17:16.367
This isn't high school, Phoebe.

17:16.688 --> 17:18.308
They are married now.

17:18.407 --> 17:19.907
And what the hell are you thinking?

17:20.008 --> 17:22.108
No, no, no. Let her go.

17:22.209 --> 17:25.169
Todd's a personal-injury attorney
and I have a hundred witnesses here.

17:25.929 --> 17:28.409
I'm sure "Ask Freebie"
has very deep pockets.

17:28.729 --> 17:31.010
Yeah, well, I'd rather be rich
than a bitch.

17:40.131 --> 17:41.271
What the hell was that?

17:41.371 --> 17:44.571
I have no idea, but that was so cool.

17:45.251 --> 17:48.811
<i>The past is the future</i>
<i>And the future is the past</i>

17:49.171 --> 17:51.932
<i>Let's welcome back</i>
<i>The senior class</i>

17:53.932 --> 17:56.812
- Now, that's more like it.
- Come on.

18:12.214 --> 18:14.214
Oh, my God.

18:21.455 --> 18:23.075
I haven't felt this way since...

18:23.175 --> 18:25.315
Homecoming game,
underneath the bleachers.

18:25.415 --> 18:27.416
Yeah, the crowd cheering.

18:28.296 --> 18:30.356
How did you make this happen?

18:30.456 --> 18:32.076
Magic.

18:32.176 --> 18:34.176
- I think I'm a witch.
- A witch, huh?

18:35.496 --> 18:37.237
How come I'm not scared of you?

18:37.337 --> 18:40.497
Because you're under my spell.

18:50.258 --> 18:52.358
Phoebe?

18:52.458 --> 18:54.459
Phoebe?

19:02.219 --> 19:04.520
- Hello?
- Okay, I found Phoebe.

19:04.620 --> 19:07.300
I have good news
and I have bad news.

19:07.620 --> 19:09.600
- Give me the good.
- Well,

19:09.700 --> 19:11.700
I now know what Phoebe was like
as a teenager.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.421
- That's also the bad news.
- How bad is it?

19:15.741 --> 19:17.781
In a word...

19:20.141 --> 19:22.141
<i>... bad.</i>

19:24.622 --> 19:26.622
Let's get out of here.

19:27.662 --> 19:29.662
Phoebe?

19:29.982 --> 19:31.983
Phoebe.

19:32.383 --> 19:34.383
Hey, wait for me.

19:41.864 --> 19:43.884
- So where are we going, guys?
- Anywhere.

19:43.984 --> 19:46.044
I don't care.
I just don't want this night to end.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.144
The night is young.

19:56.705 --> 19:58.165
I can't get busted.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.006
Don't worry,
I'm gonna get us out of here.

20:00.106 --> 20:01.726
You want to steal a cop car?

20:01.826 --> 20:04.146
Not steal, borrow.

20:06.386 --> 20:08.706
Yeah, great idea. Let's go.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.587
Phoebe!

20:27.188 --> 20:29.189
What is the "gigot"?

20:29.749 --> 20:33.509
<i>The gigot is your choice,</i>
<i>leg of lamb or mouton.</i>

20:35.189 --> 20:37.190
Mutton.

20:38.310 --> 20:40.170
What is that, meat?

20:40.270 --> 20:42.990
Yes, meat. It comes from a sheep,
you know.

20:44.190 --> 20:46.831
Why don't you just bring us
a couple of steaks, please.

20:47.151 --> 20:49.631
Medium. Thank you.

20:50.711 --> 20:53.511
Sorry, I thought you might like
a fancy meal.

20:53.831 --> 20:55.492
Why?

20:55.592 --> 20:56.852
Trying to live up to my rep.

20:56.952 --> 20:59.112
<i>With cigars and mouton?</i>

20:59.752 --> 21:01.532
Sorry, Grandpa,
that's not how you did it.

21:01.632 --> 21:03.532
- Did I take you to the batting cages?
- No.

21:03.632 --> 21:04.813
- Strip clubs?
- God, no.

21:04.913 --> 21:06.053
What did I do?

21:06.153 --> 21:09.593
You gotta tell me
because I am crashing here.

21:10.193 --> 21:12.473
Nothing, you just...

21:13.753 --> 21:15.754
We talked.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.295
Look, we should just get back.

21:24.395 --> 21:26.475
I'm undercover with demons
who'll be looking for me.

21:26.795 --> 21:29.195
No, no, no. Wait. Let's talk.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.095
We need to talk.

21:32.195 --> 21:34.796
Piper asked you here to find out
what's wrong with me, right?

21:35.916 --> 21:38.196
She just wants to know why
she's such a terrible mother.

21:38.516 --> 21:40.536
She what? No, no.

21:40.636 --> 21:42.257
She's great.

21:42.357 --> 21:44.637
Well, then why are you treating her
like she doesn't exist?

21:47.477 --> 21:49.177
Chris.

21:49.277 --> 21:51.678
If what we do is talk...

21:52.638 --> 21:54.638
...talk to me.

21:57.198 --> 22:00.559
Because she doesn't exist
in my future, okay?

22:02.079 --> 22:04.079
She dies when I turn 14.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.280
That's the event?

22:15.440 --> 22:17.180
How?

22:17.280 --> 22:19.821
I can't, all right.
I've already said way too much.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.661
The point is,

22:21.761 --> 22:24.481
after I save Wyatt,
I have to go back to where she isn't.

22:24.881 --> 22:27.441
I can't get close to her,
because I don't want to lose her again.

22:27.761 --> 22:30.122
Maybe that's all the more reason
to get close to her.

22:43.443 --> 22:47.604
Proving once again
that we are smarter than the cops.

22:47.964 --> 22:49.744
Can I play with the siren now?

22:49.844 --> 22:53.524
No, I'm cleaning the fingerprints.
We've gotta ditch the car here.

22:53.884 --> 22:55.024
Hey, what's the rush?

22:55.124 --> 22:59.125
The coast is clear, the night is young,
and so are you.

23:00.085 --> 23:03.765
Guys, I'm not gonna crawl in the trunk
again so you two can make out.

23:04.125 --> 23:07.686
Hey, we could TP Gabby Fernandez's
house, how about that?

23:08.006 --> 23:10.766
- How about lame?
- Yeah, I have to agree.

23:11.126 --> 23:12.506
This is a special night.

23:12.606 --> 23:14.707
We need imagination.

23:14.807 --> 23:17.287
Hey, Rick always said
he had imagination.

23:17.607 --> 23:19.827
That's exactly what I was thinking.

23:19.927 --> 23:21.627
This is reunion night.

23:21.727 --> 23:23.147
Let's get the gang back together.

23:23.247 --> 23:25.448
Yeah, but Rick's locked up
in county.

23:25.768 --> 23:28.688
- So?
- So the jail's closed.

23:29.048 --> 23:31.848
Well, just think of me as your
get-into-jail-free card.

23:32.168 --> 23:34.989
- You want to break in?
- Just to say hi.

23:35.089 --> 23:37.229
It's something to do, right?

23:37.329 --> 23:39.329
Right.

23:41.849 --> 23:44.590
Damn it, I thought I had her.
She's on the move again.

23:44.690 --> 23:47.070
Well, we better find her soon
because we're gonna need her

23:47.170 --> 23:49.190
if those scabber demons
come after Chris.

23:49.290 --> 23:52.171
I can't believe I let him go out
with Dad. What was I thinking?

23:52.531 --> 23:53.991
Honey, you weren't thinking.

23:54.091 --> 23:56.331
You were actually feeling,
which is allowed in this family.

24:01.372 --> 24:03.392
You're okay.

24:03.492 --> 24:05.532
Who says I'm okay?

24:05.892 --> 24:08.212
Don't worry, you'll get used to orbing
in the future.

24:08.692 --> 24:10.353
I thought something
might have happened.

24:10.453 --> 24:12.453
No, we're fine. We just talked.

24:14.653 --> 24:16.393
Really, I'm fine.

24:16.493 --> 24:19.453
Yeah. Well, Phoebe's not. She's out
running around with her old gang.

24:19.814 --> 24:22.034
- She's not downstairs?
- No, she's out the window.

24:22.134 --> 24:23.874
Even worse,
she's under the influence.

24:23.974 --> 24:25.954
- Of alcohol?
- No, adolescence.

24:26.054 --> 24:28.174
She stole a cop car as a prank.

24:28.494 --> 24:30.035
That's not a prank, it's a felony.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.435
Well, teen Phoebe also happens
to have her adult powers

24:32.535 --> 24:35.335
and she cast a spell
on her entire reunion class.

24:35.655 --> 24:36.755
- What?
- Don't worry.

24:36.855 --> 24:39.056
Paige was able to reverse it all, but...

24:40.736 --> 24:42.736
Hey, hey.

24:43.736 --> 24:46.376
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm just a little lightheaded.

24:46.696 --> 24:48.477
Sorry.

24:48.577 --> 24:50.577
You know, about me.

24:51.617 --> 24:54.337
Must have been
some hell of a talk there.

24:56.497 --> 24:58.158
Yeah.

24:58.258 --> 25:00.778
Better get off your feet, honey.
Come on.

25:01.778 --> 25:02.878
We need to stop Phoebe

25:02.978 --> 25:05.598
before she gets into some trouble
that we can't get her out of.

25:05.698 --> 25:08.059
I'm trying. She keeps moving,
she keeps moving.

25:09.459 --> 25:11.459
I got her.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.100
Glass.

25:29.221 --> 25:31.221
Get back.

25:36.142 --> 25:38.142
Icky stuff.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.363
"Icky stuff"?

25:45.463 --> 25:47.623
It worked.

25:49.623 --> 25:51.623
Here.

25:54.664 --> 25:56.444
Sorry about all this.

25:56.544 --> 25:58.204
It's okay, kids are messy.

25:58.304 --> 26:00.304
- They'll be back.
- And we'll handle it.

26:04.025 --> 26:06.785
Any idea how we're
gonna find Phoebe now?

26:14.986 --> 26:16.166
You're not my lawyers.

26:16.266 --> 26:20.106
Well, Mr. Gittridge, we're here
at the request of your public defender.

26:21.307 --> 26:23.307
- May I call you "Rick"?
- No.

26:24.507 --> 26:26.847
You don't look like much
of a defence team to me.

26:26.947 --> 26:29.327
Sit down, Gittridge.

26:29.427 --> 26:30.928
Mr. Gittridge,

26:31.028 --> 26:33.388
did you at one time provide

26:33.708 --> 26:38.628
Phoebe Halliwell with a smoke bomb
during a school assembly?

26:41.549 --> 26:43.549
All right, what is this?

26:48.870 --> 26:50.870
Hey, stay away from me.

26:53.630 --> 26:55.250
Jeez...

26:55.350 --> 26:57.050
Chill out, Rick. It's us.

26:57.150 --> 26:59.271
- We just came by to say hi.
- Hi.

27:06.871 --> 27:09.712
What the hell's going on?
How did you guys do that?

27:10.032 --> 27:12.052
Wait, are you crazy or just stupid?

27:12.152 --> 27:14.132
- No, tell me how you did that.
- It's Phoebe.

27:14.232 --> 27:17.033
She does things like magic.
But for real.

27:21.553 --> 27:23.733
We'll see how real.

27:23.833 --> 27:26.054
This isn't supposed to happen.
It's a prank.

27:26.154 --> 27:27.934
We just came to say hi.

27:28.034 --> 27:30.214
You want me to use my magic
to get you out of here?

27:30.314 --> 27:31.974
Oh, I know you are.

27:32.074 --> 27:34.754
Only way you're
getting out of here too.

27:35.075 --> 27:37.075
In for a penny, in for a pound.

27:37.675 --> 27:39.675
Let's go.

27:50.996 --> 27:52.996
All clear.

28:00.797 --> 28:02.978
Sweet.

28:03.078 --> 28:05.438
What is this?
Is this a spell or something?

28:06.038 --> 28:07.938
Or something.

28:08.038 --> 28:11.718
I never believed in much of anything
before, but I am a believer now.

28:12.078 --> 28:14.179
Whatever, have a good life.
Come on, you guys.

28:14.279 --> 28:16.619
No, wait, wait.
Don't get all attitudinal on me.

28:16.719 --> 28:19.379
It's not like we did anything
wrong here, guys.

28:19.479 --> 28:21.300
Rick, you hit a cop.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.020
That was an accident.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.820
You guys had me so freaked out
with that magic trick,

28:25.920 --> 28:27.980
I didn't know what was going on.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.100
He does have a point, Phoebe.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.781
- Yeah.
- Don't buy into his crap.

28:31.881 --> 28:33.421
He made us break him out of prison.

28:33.521 --> 28:37.561
That was justice.
You guys, I never hit no liquor store.

28:37.921 --> 28:40.602
I mean, I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

28:40.922 --> 28:42.782
You expect us to believe that?

28:42.882 --> 28:44.622
I'm being straight with you.

28:44.722 --> 28:46.302
You guys, you know me.

28:46.402 --> 28:48.682
Yeah, I'm a troublemaker,
I'm not an armed robber.

28:49.002 --> 28:51.023
- Could have fooled me.
- I grabbed the shotgun

28:51.123 --> 28:52.743
to scare you, okay.

28:52.843 --> 28:55.483
I was desperate to get out of there,
to be with you guys.

28:55.803 --> 28:57.803
I'm one of you.

29:00.484 --> 29:03.284
- What do you think, Phoebe?
- He's capable of hurting people.

29:03.604 --> 29:05.504
That's what I think.

29:05.604 --> 29:07.604
I vote we let him stick with us.

29:08.845 --> 29:11.605
Just doesn't seem right
to leave him out.

29:12.325 --> 29:14.705
That's two out of three, babe.

29:14.805 --> 29:18.366
Guess we're all back together again.
Isn't this great?

29:23.566 --> 29:25.346
The crystals should protect you.

29:25.446 --> 29:28.327
They won't be able to find you
as long as you stay in the attic.

29:28.647 --> 29:29.907
You sure about that?

29:30.007 --> 29:32.007
Well, I'm pretty sure.

29:32.527 --> 29:34.967
Okay. Well, you and Wyatt
need to go someplace safe.

29:35.287 --> 29:39.248
- I'm gonna go get him.
- No, you're not leaving this room.

29:39.648 --> 29:41.068
- What about you?
- What about me?

29:41.168 --> 29:43.228
I have to stay here and help Paige
summon Phoebe.

29:43.328 --> 29:45.469
I'm part witch, remember?
I can help Paige do that.

29:45.569 --> 29:48.349
You can't vanquish the demons
if they come and attack again.

29:48.449 --> 29:50.649
- Well, I can try.
- Listen to your mother, Chris.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.789
What if something happens to her?

29:52.889 --> 29:54.890
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

29:57.210 --> 30:00.010
Unless you know something
that I don't.

30:01.650 --> 30:03.651
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, honey.

30:04.611 --> 30:06.611
Not now.

30:09.331 --> 30:11.331
So when?

30:12.891 --> 30:14.032
Chris?

30:14.132 --> 30:15.872
Is that what you've been living with,

30:15.972 --> 30:17.972
knowing that something happens
to me?

30:20.252 --> 30:22.253
I see.

30:24.813 --> 30:26.673
Well, does it happen soon?

30:26.773 --> 30:28.393
I can't tell you that.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.773
It could change the future
in even worse ways.

30:31.093 --> 30:32.954
Right.

30:33.054 --> 30:35.574
But isn't that why you came here
in the first place?

30:35.894 --> 30:37.894
To make the future better?

30:38.214 --> 30:40.434
How do you know you haven't
already changed mine?

30:40.534 --> 30:42.535
She's got a point.

30:42.935 --> 30:46.455
Well, whatever it is, it obviously doesn't
happen until you're born,

30:46.775 --> 30:49.755
so save it, got it?

30:49.855 --> 30:51.856
I got it, Mom.

30:59.777 --> 31:02.797
And then, while I keep Miss Hickock
busy on the telephone,

31:02.897 --> 31:05.957
you three creep up to her house
and egg her car.

31:06.057 --> 31:08.878
I haven't egged a car in years.
I get first shot.

31:08.978 --> 31:10.158
Pull it together.

31:10.258 --> 31:12.438
You're acting like
you're still in high school.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.778
Because they are. I cast a spell.

31:15.858 --> 31:17.898
Okay, that explains so much.

31:18.219 --> 31:21.119
Listen, I picked up a tip today
in lockup,

31:21.219 --> 31:23.319
and I got a better idea
what we can do tonight.

31:23.419 --> 31:24.879
Knock off another liquor store?

31:24.979 --> 31:26.199
No.

31:26.299 --> 31:28.300
An armoured car.

31:29.260 --> 31:30.640
You're joking, right?

31:30.740 --> 31:33.200
No, he's not joking.
He's psycho, look at him.

31:33.300 --> 31:36.781
You're wrong. Look, I would have
never even considered it before.

31:37.101 --> 31:39.041
But we got magic now, right?

31:39.141 --> 31:41.341
I mean, we can pull this off.

31:41.661 --> 31:43.661
An armoured car, huh?

31:44.461 --> 31:46.562
A little bit big league,
don't you think?

31:46.662 --> 31:50.422
That's right, we're not kids anymore.
We gotta think about our futures.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.742
What do you say? Ramona, you in?

31:54.142 --> 31:55.363
I don't know.

31:55.463 --> 31:57.323
I don't want to go to jail.

31:57.423 --> 32:00.523
Listen, we're not gonna get caught.
We got Phoebe, all right.

32:00.623 --> 32:03.103
Now, we need a majority vote here.
So, what do you say?

32:04.544 --> 32:06.164
No.

32:06.264 --> 32:07.484
I want to go home.

32:07.584 --> 32:10.464
You're not going anywhere.

32:10.784 --> 32:12.984
In for a penny, in for a pound,
remember?

32:13.304 --> 32:15.505
The cops aren't after us,
they're after you.

32:20.185 --> 32:22.185
She's right.

32:24.186 --> 32:26.186
Come on, guys,
let's get out of here.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.986
It's over.

32:34.347 --> 32:36.667
Nothing's over until I say it's over.

32:42.228 --> 32:43.688
What's going...?
What are you doing?

32:43.788 --> 32:46.028
I kill demons every day.
You think I'm afraid of you?

32:46.348 --> 32:48.348
Stay right there.

32:56.829 --> 32:58.089
Honey, you okay?

32:58.189 --> 33:00.129
No, I'm not.
You have to send me back.

33:00.229 --> 33:01.650
You're not a teenager anymore.

33:01.750 --> 33:03.690
Very good, Paige.
Now, please, send me back.

33:03.790 --> 33:04.890
We need the power of three

33:04.990 --> 33:06.770
to vanquish the demons
that are after Chris.

33:06.870 --> 33:09.230
No, it's gonna have to wait.
There are innocents in danger.

33:09.551 --> 33:11.651
- Well, what if you revert back?
- I won't.

33:11.751 --> 33:15.711
Look, there's a crazy man with a
shotgun. Now, please send me back.

33:20.472 --> 33:22.472
Todd. Todd!

33:22.992 --> 33:25.112
- Are you okay?
- You go to the cops?

33:26.192 --> 33:28.193
No, I didn't. I swear.

33:29.673 --> 33:32.153
- Where's Ramona?
- Somewhere safe.

33:32.473 --> 33:35.193
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I got nervous when you took off.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.234
I didn't know where you went,
so I decided I need a little leverage.

33:38.594 --> 33:41.134
- Where is she?
- Don't take a tone with me, Pheebs.

33:41.234 --> 33:43.274
All right? Not if you wanna
see your friend again.

33:43.594 --> 33:46.394
She's locked up tight. Now,
if you want her to keep breathing,

33:46.714 --> 33:48.795
you're gonna do what I say.

33:50.155 --> 33:52.275
Don't you just love reunions?

34:05.477 --> 34:07.837
They should be passing by any minute.
You stop up there.

34:08.157 --> 34:10.137
You don't have to do this.
You have a choice.

34:10.237 --> 34:13.177
A choice? Here's my choice.

34:13.277 --> 34:16.438
Freedom with money to burn
or life in prison.

34:16.797 --> 34:18.498
You won't get life.

34:18.598 --> 34:21.358
Maybe not, but I'll get
30 to 40 years.

34:21.678 --> 34:23.678
That robbery was my third strike.

34:25.719 --> 34:27.418
So you did do it?

34:27.518 --> 34:29.539
Yeah. But you knew that.

34:29.639 --> 34:31.679
Even before you got all grown up.

34:32.478 --> 34:34.500
Don't to this, Rick.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.159
Don't make things worse than
they are. Tell me where Ramona is.

34:37.480 --> 34:40.080
When I get what I want,
she'll go free.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.420
Except guys like you
never get what they want.

34:42.521 --> 34:45.741
Well, not for lack of trying,
that's for damn sure.

34:45.841 --> 34:48.440
I got a feeling this time
it's gonna be different.

34:48.761 --> 34:50.380
I've got magic on my side.

34:50.481 --> 34:52.982
- God, what happened to you?
- Me?

34:53.081 --> 34:56.302
What happened to you?
You're the one who changed.

34:56.402 --> 34:59.042
You got all... different.

35:00.762 --> 35:02.763
Yeah, I did.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.803
Go.

35:11.764 --> 35:13.304
We're gonna do this
just like I said,

35:13.404 --> 35:14.984
then you're gonna give me
a new face.

35:15.084 --> 35:18.024
And not one of them lawyer faces
you used. Something new.

35:18.124 --> 35:20.125
Or Ramona dies. Are we clear?

35:24.845 --> 35:26.845
Okay.

35:28.445 --> 35:30.446
Go, go, go.

35:33.046 --> 35:35.366
I can't guarantee a perfect spell,
you know.

35:35.686 --> 35:38.066
What do you mean?
I saw you do magic.

35:38.166 --> 35:41.887
No, you saw a hormonal teenage witch
with no fear of consequences.

35:44.647 --> 35:46.647
Leave the consequences to me.

35:54.008 --> 35:55.108
Go, now.

35:55.208 --> 35:58.889
<i>Make them see what cannot be</i>
<i>Flames that leap to make them flee</i>

36:05.049 --> 36:07.050
Oh, my God, he's on fire.

36:08.090 --> 36:09.550
- Wasn't that the idea?
- No.

36:09.650 --> 36:12.410
It was just supposed to be an illusion.

36:41.893 --> 36:43.934
Now, it wouldn't be the first time
I kill someone.

36:49.694 --> 36:51.694
Let's get the money.

36:56.255 --> 36:58.235
<i>Make him hear what isn't there</i>

36:58.335 --> 37:00.935
<i>His deepest worries come to bear</i>

37:03.936 --> 37:06.056
Damn it. Where'd they come from?

37:06.376 --> 37:08.376
I think your time's running out.

37:09.776 --> 37:11.237
Let's go, let's go.

37:11.337 --> 37:13.337
Come on.

37:18.017 --> 37:19.717
I wish I was asleep.

37:19.817 --> 37:21.118
You should sleep.

37:21.218 --> 37:22.878
No, I can't.

37:22.978 --> 37:26.618
Not until Phoebe's back
and Chris' demons are vanquished

37:26.938 --> 37:30.259
and I accept the fact
that apparently I die young.

37:35.219 --> 37:37.519
You know, don't you?

37:37.619 --> 37:39.620
When it happens?

37:40.460 --> 37:42.460
It's like you said.

37:43.660 --> 37:45.660
The future could have changed.

37:48.981 --> 37:50.981
I do know that Chris loves you.

37:53.781 --> 37:55.781
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:57.581 --> 37:59.582
I love you too.

38:08.183 --> 38:10.543
Wait here. Wyatt's force field
will protect you.

38:10.863 --> 38:13.143
You stay put.
I'm gonna take care of it, okay?

38:13.463 --> 38:15.463
Just keep Chris in the attic.

38:16.023 --> 38:17.684
Okay, no more stalling.

38:17.784 --> 38:19.784
- Do it.
- Where's Ramona?

38:21.024 --> 38:22.844
You think I'm stupid?

38:22.944 --> 38:25.304
I tell you where she is,
I lose my leverage.

38:25.625 --> 38:28.065
- What's going on?
- Who are you?

38:28.385 --> 38:30.085
Don't, she's my sister.

38:30.185 --> 38:31.685
Yeah?

38:31.785 --> 38:33.125
She a witch too?

38:33.225 --> 38:35.286
Yeah, you could say
it runs in the family.

38:35.386 --> 38:38.066
Good. Then maybe she can
give me a new face.

38:38.386 --> 38:40.366
We'd be more than happy
to give you a new face

38:40.466 --> 38:42.126
once you tell us where Ramona is.

38:42.226 --> 38:44.567
What the hell.
You're my leverage now, anyway.

38:44.667 --> 38:47.307
She's locked in a tank
under the pumping station.

38:49.027 --> 38:50.727
How do we know you're
telling the truth?

38:50.827 --> 38:54.748
You don't. Now, my face.
Make it different.

38:55.548 --> 38:58.348
Heartbreaking, charming, young.

39:02.628 --> 39:06.749
You know, I'm thinking maybe you
should use our nephew for inspiration.

39:09.229 --> 39:11.409
<i>Who you were, you're now another</i>

39:11.509 --> 39:13.510
<i>Take the face of Wyatt's brother</i>

39:22.191 --> 39:25.231
Yeah. I like it. This will work.

39:25.551 --> 39:28.231
Phoebes, watch out.
This could get messy.

39:48.953 --> 39:50.494
You okay?

39:50.594 --> 39:52.594
Yeah.

39:56.354 --> 39:58.354
You know you had to, right?

40:00.555 --> 40:02.555
I know.

40:33.558 --> 40:35.218
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:35.318 --> 40:37.459
How are Todd and Ramona?

40:37.559 --> 40:39.899
They're shaky, but they're okay.

40:39.999 --> 40:42.099
Yeah? Do they remember anything?

40:42.199 --> 40:44.659
No. Once I reversed the spell,
the past was...

40:44.759 --> 40:47.800
- Forgotten?
- Some things are best forgotten.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.860
Yeah, like Freaky Phoebe?

40:49.960 --> 40:52.380
My God, I was such an angry
little teenager, huh?

40:52.480 --> 40:54.621
It's good you didn't
have your powers back then.

40:54.721 --> 40:58.921
Tell me about it. I'm just glad that's
all behind me, you know.

41:00.641 --> 41:03.862
Still, it's good for me to see you have
a couple of chinks in your armour.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.242
As an older sister,
you're quite a bit to live up to.

41:06.562 --> 41:08.622
- Shut up.
- I swear, dude.

41:08.722 --> 41:10.722
- Get out of here.
- I'm telling the truth.

41:12.562 --> 41:14.103
I'm all embarrassed now.

41:14.203 --> 41:15.623
Next time I ask you to drop by,

41:15.723 --> 41:18.623
I promise I will keep
the demonic drama to a minimum.

41:18.723 --> 41:21.063
Yeah, now you know why
I don't come around that often.

41:21.163 --> 41:24.004
- Dad.
- Just kidding... sort of.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.944
Take care of yourself. You got
a great kid growing inside of you.

41:29.044 --> 41:30.984
I look forward to really
getting to know him.

41:31.084 --> 41:33.745
I still can't believe you like orbing
in the future.

41:33.845 --> 41:35.885
- Do I live to see that?
- Oh, nice try.

41:38.085 --> 41:41.066
Don't worry so much
about the future.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.166
Spend time with him
while you can, talk to him.

41:43.486 --> 41:45.386
Every moment counts, is that it?

41:45.486 --> 41:47.486
Yeah. Something like that.

41:50.087 --> 41:52.127
Piper...

41:52.687 --> 41:54.687
...be careful.

42:11.169 --> 42:13.349
That's nice.
What else do we have in here?

42:13.449 --> 42:16.249
Look, it's a racecar. Do you see it?
