00:10.440 --> 00:13.250
(ALL SINGING) Tonight,
I'm gonna kiss her

00:13.320 --> 00:15.891
Tonight, right here on the river

00:15.960 --> 00:20.761
Ice-cold beer
Everybody's here tonight

00:21.560 --> 00:27.602
Ice-cold beer
Everybody's here tonight

00:28.280 --> 00:30.044
Wow, that was so bad, you guys.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.531
I think I threw up
in my mouth a little.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.410
We probably scared
all of the fish away.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.924
I never catch anything anyway.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.650
What, two beautiful
women don't rate?

00:38.720 --> 00:42.247
You kidding me? Pretty thing like
you, you're not even a keeper.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.482
I should toss you in right now.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.641
(BOTH LAUGHING)

00:48.160 --> 00:49.810
So I'm gonna get some more beer.

00:50.920 --> 00:51.967
Okay.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.246
That's good.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.926

You little pervert!

01:23.720 --> 01:24.960
What do you think you're doing?

01:25.520 --> 01:26.520
(USING SIGN LANGUAGE)

01:26.560 --> 01:28.483
Nothing, I was just
going for a walk.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.769
(SCOFFS) You were not
just walking around.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.047
I saw you spying on us.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.201
I'm gonna tell Dad.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.848
No. You can't.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.565
If you don't
want me to tell him,

01:38.640 --> 01:40.529
you need to get
your butt outta here.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.524
Not him.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.560
Anybody but him.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.369
Why do you care about Jake?

01:51.640 --> 01:53.847
I mean, he doesn't
even know that you exist.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.560
I love him.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.446
Look, you're never going to be
the same as them, you know,

02:01.520 --> 02:02.931
so you need to stop
trying to become

02:03.040 --> 02:04.405
something that you're not.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.251
Now, go.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.166
What, no beer?

02:26.640 --> 02:28.244
Changed my mind.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.882
What's the matter?
You scared of me?

02:57.520 --> 02:58.521

(BOTH LAUGHING)

03:45.920 --> 03:47.490
That was incredible.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.167
You're incredible.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.050
You're not so bad yourself.

04:05.840 --> 04:06.841
Huh?

04:07.440 --> 04:08.601
No!

04:10.280 --> 04:12.601
No! Help! Help!

04:13.440 --> 04:15.204
Get out of the water!
What's going on?

04:15.280 --> 04:16.281
Get out!

05:55.920 --> 05:59.766
Well, this is
the last of your stuff.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.485
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

06:01.560 --> 06:03.289
Whoa! Wait, what?

06:03.840 --> 06:05.444
Of course this is a good idea.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.363
This is a great idea,
'cause you and I...

06:07.440 --> 06:08.441
No, no.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.681
What?
Not that.

06:10.760 --> 06:14.481
I'm just... I'm saying,
I have so much stuff,

06:14.600 --> 06:17.410
and your house suddenly
seems a lot smaller.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.204
No, there's plenty of room.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.123
Plus, look,
it's a golden opportunity

06:21.200 --> 06:23.009
for me to get rid of some stuff.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.360
What are you
going to get rid of?

06:24.640 --> 06:25.687
Oh.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.569
You kidding? Any number of...

06:27.640 --> 06:28.641
Like...

06:29.920 --> 06:31.206
Or...

06:31.960 --> 06:34.327
You know, like this,
for example.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.882
Well, that's a start.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.365
This was presented personally

06:38.440 --> 06:39.720
to my great, great Uncle Bernard

06:39.760 --> 06:41.410
by Sigmund Riefler himself

06:41.480 --> 06:43.448
when Bernard retired from
the Clemens Riefler

06:43.520 --> 06:44.521
clock works in Munich.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.800
Sigmund was the son of the
founder Clemens Riefler,

06:46.840 --> 06:49.411
but it was actually Sigmund who
invented the Riefler escapement,

06:49.480 --> 06:52.370
which is a mechanical device
for precision pendulum clocks.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.090
And I actually have
one right over there.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.520
So...

06:58.160 --> 07:01.084
I think everything should
stay right where it is.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.086
Even me.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.681
(SIGHS)

07:15.120 --> 07:16.451
Hey.
Hey.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.124
I cut up some fruit.
You want some?

07:18.240 --> 07:20.607
Yeah, please,
and a lot of coffee.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.125
Got you covered.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.366
What?

07:31.720 --> 07:33.006
Nothing.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.091
That's what makes this so great.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.041
Yeah, I really
missed all this, like,

07:38.120 --> 07:39.565
everyday stuff.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.041
Hmm.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.441
I missed that too.

07:44.840 --> 07:45.887
See you after work.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.042
Hey, hey, what about
the doctor's reports?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.323
Ah, he was supposed to send
me the email yesterday.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.482
Just check my email,
see if it came in.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.011
Tell me if I'm still alive.

SHERIFF GAFFEN: Gillnetter
out on Government Island

07:58.600 --> 08:00.200
fished him out of
the river this morning.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.368
I cross-checked
with missing persons.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.284
A report was filed yesterday
matching his description,

08:05.680 --> 08:08.206
name listed as Daniel Hopkins.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.606
HANK: Same as we got.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.849
Report also lists as
a possible assault.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.720
Looks pretty beat up.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.331
Probably from river debris.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.484
NICK: I don't know about
these marks on his ankles.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.921
Yeah, same here too,
like scratches.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.486
Yeah, scratches or claws.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.160
Maybe something
pulled him under.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.288
What are we talking,
a Loch Ness Monster?

08:27.720 --> 08:29.165
Who filed the report?

08:29.240 --> 08:30.730
Uh, Jake Barnes.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.450
Filed last night at 9:15.

08:32.840 --> 08:33.966
Let's talk to him.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.284
JAKE: One second.

Jake Barnes?
Yeah.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.041
I'm Detective Burkhardt,
this is Detective Griffin.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.248
You filed a missing persons
report for Daniel Hopkins.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.367
Oh, God, did you find him?

08:51.040 --> 08:52.041
Mind if we talk inside?

08:52.960 --> 08:53.961
(SIGHS)

08:54.040 --> 08:55.280
Yeah, sure.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.011
So did he make it out?

09:03.880 --> 09:06.281
Afraid not. They discovered
Dan's body this morning.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.726
Oh, man.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.006
Oh, man, I was afraid of this.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.491
You know, he was...
He was pulled underwater.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.160
By What?

09:19.200 --> 09:21.521
I don't know, I just saw
something, it got me too.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.726
All right, we're gonna
need you to go over

09:22.800 --> 09:24.529
everything that
happened yesterday.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.410
Where you were, who was there,
anything you can remember.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.686
Oh, jeez.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.369
He's really dead,
I can't believe this.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.090
All right, was anyone
else there with you?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.165
No, not at first. Um...

09:36.040 --> 09:38.088
We were fishing
up near Steelhead,

09:38.160 --> 09:40.970
and, um, then these
two girls showed up.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.280
You get their names?
Mmm-hmm.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.521
Sarah and Anna.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.400
They were sisters, I didn't...

09:45.480 --> 09:47.040
I'm sorry, I didn't
get their last name.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.840
You must have
got a number, right?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.047
I never had a chance.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.451
I mean, one thing
led to another.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.601
Did things get sexual?

09:53.680 --> 09:54.681
Yeah.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.125
Who were you with?

09:56.360 --> 09:58.044
Sarah. Dan was with Anna.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.691
We were all in the river.
Sarah and I...

10:02.080 --> 10:06.768
Anyway, um, afterwards,
we were swimming, and...

10:08.760 --> 10:10.410
That's when I heard Dan.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.131
He was screaming, and Anna
looked really scared,

10:13.200 --> 10:14.850
and she was yelling for us
to get out of the river,

10:14.920 --> 10:17.605
(SNIFFLING)
and then something...

10:18.040 --> 10:20.281
Something pulled him under.

10:20.360 --> 10:21.407
Did you try to get to him?

10:21.840 --> 10:23.285
Of course, but...

10:23.880 --> 10:26.360
I mean, and then something
pulled me under too.

10:27.480 --> 10:30.051
And then that's the
last thing I remember.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.923
Look, I told all this
to the police last night.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.729
I don't think they believed me.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.560
How'd you manage to get out?

10:42.440 --> 10:43.930
I'm not sure.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.088
I mean, all I know
is there was this...

10:47.840 --> 10:49.126
This what?

10:50.320 --> 10:52.641
Girl, I think, but you know...

10:52.720 --> 10:54.165
I mean, I'm not even
sure she was real, man.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.810
I mean, I was still
just trying to breathe.

10:55.880 --> 10:56.881
It wasn't Sarah or Anna?

10:56.960 --> 10:58.530
No, this one was younger,

10:58.600 --> 11:01.570
but I don't know, man,
I don't know what I saw.

11:02.760 --> 11:03.966
How'd you get those scratches?

11:07.040 --> 11:10.601
I'm telling you, I mean, it felt
like something, like, grabbed me.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.251
Okay, what kind of something?

11:12.720 --> 11:14.768
I mean, it's a little hard to
focus when you're drowning.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.366
Why don't you take us to the
place where this all happened?

11:17.640 --> 11:18.971
JAKE: My car was parked
behind these trees.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.565
We came down here
and made a campfire.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.881
My clothes were
right here, Dan's too.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.530
I mean, I looked all up and
down the river for him.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.967
I should have gone in after
him, but after what happened...

11:27.560 --> 11:28.686
Is this where you
went into the river?

11:28.760 --> 11:29.807
Yes.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.451
And where'd you get pulled out?

11:31.520 --> 11:33.170
Uh, down there, I guess.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.284
What happened to the
girls you were with?

11:36.600 --> 11:37.965
I don't know, I...

11:38.440 --> 11:39.885
I mean, I thought maybe
they got grabbed too,

11:39.960 --> 11:41.644
but then their clothes
were gone when I came to.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.800
You said there was another
girl that pulled you out.

11:43.840 --> 11:44.887
What happened to her?

11:44.960 --> 11:48.885
Uh... I think she ran off as
soon as I was out of the river.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.564
Now, when did you call 911?

11:50.640 --> 11:52.051
Soon as I got back up here.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.884
I couldn't find my
phone, so I used Dan's.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.880
HANK: How did
the girls get here?

11:57.120 --> 11:58.645
(MUFFLED) Just came
from back there.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.370
HANK: You didn't see a car?
JAKE: No.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.646
Hank!

12:04.480 --> 12:05.766
Police!

12:07.320 --> 12:08.481
Stop!

12:10.160 --> 12:12.128
I'm not gonna hurt you!

12:41.160 --> 12:42.160
What happened?

12:42.240 --> 12:43.526
She dove in.

12:43.920 --> 12:44.921
You see her come up?

12:45.160 --> 12:46.685
Yeah, about 50 yards out.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.963
HANK: She swam all
that way underwater?

12:49.280 --> 12:50.850
What are we dealing with?

12:50.920 --> 12:53.207
Hey, hey, I think that's the
girl I saw when I came up.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.841
Where'd she go?

12:55.280 --> 12:56.281
I'm not sure.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.844
River patrol
didn't find any bodies

13:00.920 --> 13:03.002
matching Jake's
description of Sarah, Anna,

13:03.080 --> 13:04.969
or the girl Nick saw
jump into the river.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.121
They're probably still alive.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.680
Somebody went back to the campsite
and took the sisters' clothes.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.125
Jake said they were scared.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.811
They probably got out of the river,
grabbed their stuff and ran.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.961
The girl I saw go into the river

13:14.040 --> 13:17.010
was a lot more than a girl
when she got under the water.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.847
You know what she was?
Not yet.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.968

the unusual suspects.

Oui.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.841
(RENARD SPEAKING
FRENCH OVER PHONE)

14:00.920 --> 14:01.921
Are you alone?

14:02.360 --> 14:03.407
I can talk.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.641
You received the photo?

14:05.960 --> 14:06.961
Adalind.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.004
The Sacher Hotel room number
I found at Frau Pech's...

14:10.640 --> 14:12.210
...it's Adalind's room.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.603
She was doing business
with Frau Pech?

14:14.960 --> 14:15.960
Apparently.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.289
Frau Pech might have approached her
knowing she was a lawyer for the family.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.251
In order to get around me and
make a deal for the child.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.289
Did my brother know about this?

14:25.840 --> 14:28.047
I never had a chance to tell him.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.289
We still don't know
who's selling the baby.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.645
Or whose child it is.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.887
Unless Adalind approached
Frau Pech to make the deal.

14:41.920 --> 14:42.920
Adalind?

14:44.400 --> 14:47.961
She might be the one who's going to
have a child with Royal blood to sell.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.521
MONROE: In the river?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.568
You know, I'm not really
that much of a water person.

14:53.640 --> 14:57.406
I'm really more of a mountain
and land kind of lubber.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.847
There was this girl I knew
in Seattle, she was a Naiad,

14:59.960 --> 15:01.450
lived out on Bainbridge Island.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.568
She was kind of weird.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.246
Nice, though.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.244
But she could swim,
man, like a fish.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.763
Uh, Naiad?

15:10.840 --> 15:12.171
Oh, Naiads.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.440
Yeah, no, I've heard of Naiads.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.811
I've never seen one, though.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.601
What are they, like,
a water nymph or something?

15:17.680 --> 15:19.762
Sort of. Very
close-knit families.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.285
They never stray
far from the water.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.601
That's probably why Jake can't
describe who saved him.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.728
I bet you'd have something
about them in your trailer.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.280
Well, at least we have an idea
of what we're dealing with now.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.441
Yeah.

15:33.480 --> 15:34.845
Right, we should be going.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.921
Looks like you guys
have a lot left to do.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.769
Yeah, we do. We sure do.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.604
Hey, you know, but if
you guys need any help,

15:41.680 --> 15:42.806
you know, in the trailer...

15:44.440 --> 15:48.286
I mean, I probably shouldn't
leave with so much left to do.

15:48.680 --> 15:49.761
Go ahead.

15:49.840 --> 15:50.841
Are you sure?

15:51.840 --> 15:53.320
I mean, it's not
gonna take that long.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.407
Please, take him.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.086
Thanks.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.769
Listen to this, it's dated 1755.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.366

for the East India Company.

the Andersen Marina.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.728
That's not far up the river
from where they went swimming.

How you want to handle this?

17:52.880 --> 17:54.405
Meet us at the marina.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.689
We should bring Jake along in case
he can ID whoever took the phone.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.004
You ever been here?
No.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.810
You know anybody who lives here?

18:11.120 --> 18:12.531
Uh, not that I know of.

this is Detective Griffin.

investigation about a drowning.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.121

Who drowned?

18:53.480 --> 18:54.520
Can I have your name, sir?

anybody who drowned.

It was taken from where the
victim went into the river.

I haven't done anything
wrong, and I told you,

19:07.080 --> 19:09.367
I don't know anybody who drowned,
so this must be a mistake.

just leave us alone?

I was telling you about.

Anna, get in the house.

he's talking about.

Well, I guess we have more to
talk about than I thought.

But I'm going to talk
to your daughters first,

give you some time
to think about it.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.245
Damn it.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.361
I told you I didn't want
this kind of trouble.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.441
Why did you do it?

22:41.520 --> 22:43.921
Because you forgot where you come from.
We haven't.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.002
I haven't forgotten anything.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.408
I know what it
takes for us to survive.

Your world died 200 years ago,

and now you've
jeopardized all of us

22:52.520 --> 22:53.885
with this fundamental crap!

22:54.120 --> 22:56.441
It was Elly, your daughter.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.126
She pulled him out.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.850
Which is how that
phone got in your house.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.001
She has to be cut.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.924
Are you crazy?
Nobody does that anymore.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.004
Where we're from, they do, and we
don't have these kinds of troubles.

girl that pulled him out.

us what happened?

what you and your sister are.

you're talking about.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.286
You're Naiads.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.684
You really want to
spend the next 24 hours

23:52.760 --> 23:54.125
drying out in a holding cell?

'Cause that's where you're going
if you don't start talking.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.040
I have nothing to say.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.845
Well, let's hope
your sister does.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.846
Jake saw Dan pulled under.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.721
HANK: Jake is only alive
because Elly saved him.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.724
That means you
either saw what happened

24:21.800 --> 24:23.290
or were involved
with what happened.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.091
NICK: You need
to tell us, Anna.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.606
Because I know Naiads can only
be out of the water for so long.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.604
And you will die in here
if you don't start talking.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.969
Who pulled Jake under the water?

24:48.040 --> 24:49.246
Who killed Dan?

24:55.920 --> 24:58.161
Knowing what they are and
what will happen to them,

24:58.240 --> 24:59.287
we don't want to
keep them locked up.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.850
But they're not
giving us much choice.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.241
At the very least, they know what
happened and didn't report it.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.520
So they might know who did it.

25:04.640 --> 25:08.361
Well, that's the problem. We think
they're protecting somebody.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.880
How much time do
you think they have?

25:10.480 --> 25:11.925
I doubt they'll
survive the night.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.526
And what about the girl who saved
your victim from the river?

25:14.680 --> 25:15.681
Can't find her.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.650
So how do we explain two dead
women in our holding cells?

25:18.720 --> 25:20.449
We can't very well
say they're Naiads.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.249
We'll get blamed for something
we had no control over.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.322
And they're playing
a very serious game.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.529
If they're involved, what
do we do, just let 'em go?

25:27.600 --> 25:30.729
No. This is their
problem, not ours.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.605
If they choose to die, we
let the ME explain it.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.964
Just 'cause they're Wesen, it doesn't
entitle them to special treatment.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.245
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

25:39.320 --> 25:40.446
Yeah?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.128
Girls' father,
Abel Mahario, is here.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.084
Apparently, he wants to talk.

25:46.960 --> 25:49.804
I killed that boy.
I did it.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.927
You need to arrest me
and let my daughters go.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.360
How'd you kill him?

25:54.440 --> 25:55.646
I drowned him.

25:55.880 --> 25:56.881
Why?

25:57.600 --> 25:59.284
(THROUGH SPEAKER)
I have my reasons.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.010
HANK: I know you didn't
do it for a cell phone.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.645
We know you want
to save your girls,

26:03.080 --> 26:05.481
but we'd rather leave here with
whoever's really responsible.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.245
I am! I told you I did it!

26:08.320 --> 26:10.163
I pulled him underwater!

26:10.320 --> 26:12.084
Were your daughters there too?
No.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.321
Jake Barnes says they were.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.526
Well, he's lying.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.011
Why would he lie?

26:17.440 --> 26:19.010
He just saw them.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.481
Then they were there?

26:21.600 --> 26:24.251
I saw those two boys
attacking my daughters,

26:24.320 --> 26:25.845
and I did what I had to do.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.040
So you're telling us you
were saving your daughters?

26:28.280 --> 26:29.770
They were being raped.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.841
Oh!

26:31.600 --> 26:34.080
Then why did your other daughter
pull Jake out of the water?

26:34.160 --> 26:35.321
Who gave you the black eye?

26:35.400 --> 26:36.640
Did you know she was there too?

26:36.680 --> 26:37.966
What time did you get there?

26:38.280 --> 26:39.327
How did you get there?

26:39.400 --> 26:40.811
You walk? Take a car?

26:40.960 --> 26:43.281
What did the other guy look
like, the one you killed?

26:43.360 --> 26:46.364
Was he tall, short,
fat, black, white?

26:46.440 --> 26:47.680
We need some details here.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.489
Why don't you take us to the
place where it happened?

You see how difficult this gets

26:51.080 --> 26:52.684

telling the truth?

26:52.760 --> 26:54.046
Why does it matter?

26:54.360 --> 26:56.886
I'm offering my
life for my daughters'.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.371
Not easy being a parent.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.800
Yeah, but it could
be what we need.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.281
Those girls may be ready to
throw their own lives away,

27:09.720 --> 27:11.131
but they might not be so willing

27:11.200 --> 27:12.611
when it's their dad's
life they're dealing with.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.091
Use his confession as leverage?

27:14.240 --> 27:15.800
Might be just as
tough being a daughter.

27:16.960 --> 27:20.123
I guess we'll find out
if it's a loving family.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.566
I thought you were dead.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.331
You sure look like it.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.286

Elly!

Oh, thank God she's okay.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.926
ABEL: Oh, baby, come here.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.245
You're okay.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.161

REPORTER: (THROUGH LAPTOP) Europe
and the world have gathered today

40:40.760 --> 40:41.761
in Vienna, Austria,

40:41.840 --> 40:44.571
to mourn the passing
of Crown Prince Eric Renard,

40:44.960 --> 40:47.964
Second in line to the
Kronenberg throne and empire.

40:48.040 --> 40:51.249
British media report allegations
by an unnamed source

40:51.320 --> 40:53.891
that an underground movement
may have been responsible

40:53.960 --> 40:56.042
for the Crown
Prince's assassination.

40:56.120 --> 40:59.727
Austrian police are working with
French and British intelligence

40:59.800 --> 41:01.450
to find those responsible.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.847
The question on
everyone's mind is,

41:03.920 --> 41:07.288
who will be given the reins
of this royal family?

41:09.880 --> 41:11.086
JAKE: Number three.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.962
You sure?
Yeah.

41:27.240 --> 41:30.084
Look, can I... Can I ask
you guys something?

Sure.

(SIGHS)

41:34.240 --> 41:36.971
I'm not so sure how
to say this, but...

41:38.040 --> 41:40.930
You know that girl that pulled
me out of the water, Elly?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.001
What about her?

41:42.840 --> 41:48.324
Well, I don't know, but I saw
something really strange.

41:48.760 --> 41:49.886
Like what?

41:49.960 --> 41:51.086
Like, I...

41:51.920 --> 41:54.730
Think she's, like,
a mutant or something,

41:54.800 --> 41:57.770
some kind of, like,
mermaid thing... I...

41:59.360 --> 42:01.362
Okay, I know how
that sounds, believe me.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.601
I just...
She came over when...

42:06.280 --> 42:08.203
And she just wasn't...

42:10.760 --> 42:11.761
Normal.

42:12.560 --> 42:13.971
Nobody is, Jake.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.810
It's Portland.
