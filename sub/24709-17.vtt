06:24.425 --> 06:25.718
BRUCE CLAYTON.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.387
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THIS?

06:27.428 --> 06:28.888
I WAS UPSTAIRS,

06:28.930 --> 06:30.390
AND I HEARD THE SHOT.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.558
I COME RUNNING,
AND I FOUND HIM LIKE THAT.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.560
WHAT DO YOU THINK

THERE WAS THESE
2 BLACK GUYS

06:43.403 --> 06:45.363
WHAT KIND OF A LOOK
DID YOU GET AT THEM?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.864

06:52.954 --> 06:56.249
I TRIED CPR ON HIM,
BUT, UM...

06:56.290 --> 06:58.251
HE WAS GONE.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.460
DESERT EAGLE.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.754
ONE EXPENDED ROUND.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.006
DUMPED IN A TRASH CONTAINER
DOWN THE HALL.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.801
EXPENSIVE PIECE
FOR A DOPER TO LEAVE BEHIND.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.302
THAT'S ACTUALLY MINE.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.929
WELL, IT WAS IN MY NAME.

07:09.971 --> 07:13.099

07:13.141 --> 07:14.684
WE WENT IN ON IT TOGETHER.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.018

07:38.040 --> 07:40.793
I ACTUALLY TOOK IT OUT
TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BE ON IT.

07:40.877 --> 07:41.836
WHAT WAS ON IT?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.296
I DIDN'T SHOW ANYONE.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.715
LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS
SOME MALFUNCTION.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.422
POLICE! DON'T MOVE!

11:16.175 --> 11:17.218
GREAT.

11:17.301 --> 11:19.512
NOW WE GOTTA GET
THAT SPECIAL VAN.

11:41.867 --> 11:45.454
LIEUTENANT FANCY
WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
AS SOON AS YOU GOT BACK.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.039
THANKS.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.167
UH, THE COFFEE ROOM'S
OVER HERE, BRUCE, UH...

11:50.209 --> 11:51.961
A FEW PASTRIES
AND SO FORTH.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.088
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
GET YOURSELF SET UP
WHILE, UH,

11:54.171 --> 11:55.464
WHILE WE TALK.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.466
OK.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.469
UH...IF YOU DON'T
HAVE A PASSION
FOR CREAM FILLING,

12:00.511 --> 12:03.556
I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D LEAVE
THAT ONE FOR ME.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.058
BOSS.

12:07.685 --> 12:10.104
SO WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE
AT THAT HEALTH CLINIC?

12:10.187 --> 12:12.440
WELL, THIS GUY
IN THE COFFEE ROOM
AND THE D.O.A.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.941
WERE BOTH SECURITY GUARDS.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.443
THIS ONE DIDN'T WITNESS
THE SHOOTING,

12:15.526 --> 12:16.944
BUT SAYS HE SAW
2 BLACK GUYS

12:17.027 --> 12:18.988
HE FIGURED FOR DRUG ADDICTS
FLEE THE SCENE.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.531
HIS STORY'S GOT
BIG HOLES IN IT.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.366
HE DIDN'T MENTION
A WOMAN FLEEING THE SCENE?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.826
Medavoy: UH-UH.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.536
A GUY JUST CAME IN.

12:25.619 --> 12:28.664
SAID HE SAW A WOMAN
RUN FROM THE CLINIC
AROUND 5:15 THIS MORNING.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.167
THAT'S WHO THIS
GUARD'S COVERING FOR.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.669
THERE'S, LIKE,
A 40-MINUTE SECTION
OF THE TAPE

12:33.711 --> 12:35.671
FROM THE SURVEILLANCE
CAMERA THAT'S BEEN ERASED.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.298
SEEMS PRETTY CERTAIN
THIS GUARD DID THAT.

12:37.381 --> 12:38.799
PLUS WE FOUND
A .44 DESERT EAGLE

12:38.883 --> 12:40.301
IN THE TRASH CAN
AT THE SCENE,

12:40.384 --> 12:43.053
OWNED BY THIS GUARD
AND THE D.O.A. JOINTLY.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.015
HE'S GOT SOME
EXPLAINING TO DO.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.895
REMEMBER THE GAP
ON THE NIXON TAPES?

12:50.936 --> 12:53.355
YOU KNOW, MY DAD
USED TO SIT

12:53.397 --> 12:55.900
WITH HALF A LOAD ON
IN FRONT OF THE TV,

12:55.941 --> 12:57.443
YOU KNOW,
WHEN THEY'D BE,
UH, ALIBIING

12:57.526 --> 12:58.861
HOW THE PRESIDENT'S
SECRETARY

12:58.944 --> 13:00.863
"ACCIDENTALLY"
ERASED THAT TAPE.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.491
HE'D BE TALKIN'
AT THE TV SCREEN.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.117
"YOU THINK
WE'RE COMPLETE IDIOTS?

13:05.201 --> 13:08.329
A CONTORTIONIST
COULDN'T DO
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING."

13:08.412 --> 13:11.165
HE WAS A REGISTERED
REPUBLICAN, TOO, MY DAD.

13:11.248 --> 13:14.293
YEAH. HE JUST NEVER
FOUND THAT EXPLANATION
CREDIBLE.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.133
[DOOR OPENS]

13:22.426 --> 13:23.844
SIT DOWN.

13:23.928 --> 13:27.014
BRUCE, AN EYEWITNESS

13:27.097 --> 13:28.224
PUTS A WOMAN RUNNING
OUT OF THE CLINIC

13:28.265 --> 13:29.892
AFTER THE SHOOTING
THIS MORNING.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.561
NO 2 BLACK JUNKIES.

13:32.603 --> 13:33.938
YOU'RE GETTING
IN SO DEEP, BRUCE,

13:33.979 --> 13:35.940
PRETTY SOON NOBODY'S
GONNA BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.071
THE WOMAN--AHEM--

13:42.112 --> 13:44.406
THAT RAN OUT...

13:44.448 --> 13:46.700
SHE'S A NURSE
AT THE CLINIC.

13:46.784 --> 13:47.952
WHAT'S HER NAME?

13:47.993 --> 13:49.245
VAL DIXON.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.539
VAL'S DEPRESSED,
MORE AND MORE.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.749
HER HUSBAND'S
NOT ABLE TO FIND WORK.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.627
I THINK ALL THAT
MADE HER VULNERABLE

13:56.710 --> 13:58.671
TO THIS TYPE OF THING
WITH BOB McCLURE.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.464
SHE AND McCLURE
WERE HAVING
AN AFFAIR?

14:00.548 --> 14:03.217
VAL TRIED BREAKING
THINGS OFF WITH BOB
A MONTH AGO.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.802
ALL NIGHT LONG,
HE'D TALK ABOUT HER.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.097
AND HE'D CALL, AND
HE'D MAKE HER GO TO THE
PAY PHONE AT ECONO-GAS

14:08.180 --> 14:09.598
AND CALL HIM BACK.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.185
THEN MORNINGS, I'D SEE
HER SHOWING UP FOR WORK.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.145
YOU COULD TELL SHE WAS
GETTING MORE AND MORE
STRESSED OUT.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.522
DID HE CALL LAST NIGHT?

14:16.605 --> 14:19.400
YES. AND WHEN
HE CAME IN AFTER,

14:19.483 --> 14:23.362
HE HAD THIS BIG,
RED FLUSH IN HIS FACE,

14:23.445 --> 14:25.406
HE SAID HE WAS
GONNA MAKE HER LIFE
GOOD AND MISERABLE.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.116
WHAT TIME WAS THIS?

14:27.157 --> 14:28.784
2:00.

14:28.826 --> 14:32.454
THEY RERUN
THE 11:00 NEWS,
AND IT JUST ENDED.

14:32.496 --> 14:35.082
DID YOU TELL US THE TRUTH
ABOUT NOT WITNESSING
THE SHOOTING?

14:35.165 --> 14:37.126
YES, I DID.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.588
I HEARD THE SHOT,
RAN DOWN, AND FOUND BOB.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.882
DID YOU SEE VAL
KILL BOB?

14:42.965 --> 14:44.383
NO, I DIDN'T.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.676
WAS SHE ON THE TAPE?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.553
WELL,
I ASSUME SHE WAS.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.638
BUT IT WAS YOU
ERASED IT.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.641
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HER
THROWING THAT GUN
IN THE TRASH.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.143
I'D HAVE GONE
AND RETRIEVED IT.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.937
SHE DID NOT WANT TO
CONTINUE THAT AFFAIR.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.940
HE--HE--HE WAS
STRESSING HER OUT.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.284
I HOPE SPOOKY
IS YOUR STREET NAME?

15:10.367 --> 15:12.286
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.289
SO HOW ABOUT GIVING UP
YOUR REAL NAME, SPOOKY?

15:15.372 --> 15:17.708
MY REAL NAME'S
JEROME...ALLARDIS.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.503
WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT, ANYWAY?

15:21.545 --> 15:24.715
WELL, ONE THING IT'S ABOUT
IS YOU IN POSSESSION.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.759
WE'RE GONNA
GET YOUR RAP SHEET,

15:26.842 --> 15:28.552
FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND
OF JACKPOT THAT PUTS
YOU IN.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.554
THAT'S NOT MY PLACE.
THAT ROCK DON'T
BELONG TO ME.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.556
THE BIG POT WE GOT
BOILING FOR YOU, SPOOKY,

15:32.640 --> 15:35.100
IS THEM 2 GIRLS
GOT RAPED IN THAT APARTMENT

15:35.184 --> 15:37.311
AND THEN SHOT IN THE HEAD
UP ON THE ROOF.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.812
NAH-UH. I DIDN'T
SHOOT NO GIRLS.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.189
GET OVER ON 'EM
IN THE APARTMENT?

15:40.230 --> 15:41.815
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHICH GIRLS
YOU TALKING ABOUT!

15:41.899 --> 15:45.110
OK, NITWIT, DID YOU
BANG ANY GIRLS
EVER IN THAT APARTMENT?

15:45.194 --> 15:47.154
DID YOU SEE
THAT CRIPPLE, MAN,
IN THAT APARTMENT?

15:47.237 --> 15:48.656
WHAT DOES THAT GOT
TO DO WITH THE GIRLS?

15:48.739 --> 15:50.324
WE TAKE CARE
OF JAMAL.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.326
LOOK, ANYTHING
ELSE THAT GOES ON,
WHO THE HELL KNOWS?

15:52.409 --> 15:54.578
SPOOKY AND HIS PALS
DOING THEIR GOOD DEED

15:54.620 --> 15:57.081
TAKING CARE OF THEIR
CRIPPLED DEALER FRIEND
JAMAL,

15:57.122 --> 15:59.416
WHO'S TO BEGRUDGE THEM
AN OCCASIONAL RAPE?

15:59.458 --> 16:01.085
I DIDN'T SAY
I RAPED ANYBODY!

16:01.168 --> 16:05.130
UH, SPOOKY, SAY THAT
YOU WERE WITH THOSE GIRLS
IN JAMAL'S APARTMENT,

16:05.214 --> 16:08.717
BUT YOU WERE NOT THE ONE
THAT PULLED THE TRIGGER
UP ON THAT ROOF.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.886
THAT WOULD PUT YOU
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.764
OF COURSE, MAYBE IT WAS YOU
WHO PULLED THAT TRIGGER.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.682
HELL IF IT WAS.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.725
ONE OF THOSE GIRLS
LIVED, SPOOKY.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.310
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.563
DON'T TELL ME THAT BITCH
PICKED ME OUT, 'CAUSE
THAT'S A DAMN LIE.

16:21.605 --> 16:22.856
'CAUSE YOU
WORE A SKI MASK?

16:22.940 --> 16:25.359
WE KNOW ABOUT
THE SKI MASKS, SPOOKY.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.778
AND THAT GIRL THAT LIVED,

16:27.820 --> 16:29.697
UP ON THE ROOF,

16:29.780 --> 16:32.866
SHE HEARD 2 DIFFERENT GUYS
SAY YOUR NAME.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.247
ALL RIGHT, SAY I DID
WEAR A SKI MASK.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.415
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT WOULD PROVE?

16:39.456 --> 16:40.582
WHAT ELSE, SHERLOCK?

16:40.624 --> 16:42.251
IF I WAS GONNA CAP HER,

16:42.292 --> 16:44.628
WHAT THE HELL WOULD I
WEAR A SKI MASK FOR? SHE
WOULD BE DEAD ANYWAY.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.213
WHAT WOULD I CARE
IF SHE SEEN MY FACE?

16:46.296 --> 16:47.256
GOOD POINT.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.133
ALL RIGHT.
WHO DID SHOOT 'EM?

16:49.174 --> 16:53.053
NAH. I GOTTA
REPRESENT.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.808
RISE, SPOOKY.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.565
BUT IT WASN'T
YOUR PAL LEON THAT
WE GOT IN THE OTHER ROOM

17:04.648 --> 17:06.066
THAT DID IT?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.651
NAH, IT WASN'T LEON.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.531
AND DON'T TRY TO PUT
IT ON HIM, EITHER.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.920
MAN, IT'S
SKANKY IN HERE.

17:27.004 --> 17:30.215
YEAH, THAT'S THE LAST
THING YOU SHOULD BE
WORRYING ABOUT, BRO.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.176
TIME FOR A REALITY
CHECK, LEON.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.553
THAT ROCK WE FOUND
ON YOU, THAT'S IN
OUR POCKET NOW.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.472
WE SAY THE WORD,
YOU GO AWAY.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.848
NOW WE GET
TO THE RAPE.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.349
I DON'T NEED
TO DO NO RAPES.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.477
SO MAYBE YOU WERE
JUST STAYING IN
SHAPE WITH THESE?

17:41.518 --> 17:43.896
WE KNOW ABOUT THE RAPES,
WE KNOW ABOUT ROOF,

17:43.979 --> 17:47.024
AND WE KNOW ONE OTHER THING
WHICH WILL SAVE YOUR ASS
IF YOU LET IT.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.151
WE KNOW YOU
WORE A SKI MASK, LEON.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.403
YOU WERE AFRAID THOSE
GIRLS COULD I.D. YOU,

17:51.487 --> 17:53.822
WHICH PROVES THAT
YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO KILL THEM.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.409
NOW, KNOWING THAT
YOU'RE NOT GUILTY OF
PREMEDITATED MURDER,

17:57.493 --> 17:59.411
WE WILL WORK
WITH YOU ON THIS,

17:59.495 --> 18:00.746
BUT YOU GOTTA
GIVE UP ALL YOU GOT.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.248
ONE OF YOU DID
NOT WEAR A SKI MASK.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.708
SAVE YOUR LIFE, LEON.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.544
TELL US WHO THAT WAS.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.880
YEAH, WE WENT
UP TO THE ROOF.

18:09.963 --> 18:12.382
WE THOUGHT WE WAS
GONNA HAVE MORE SEX.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.384
THEN JACKSON SAYS
HE'S GONNA CAP 'EM,

18:14.468 --> 18:16.386
PAYIN' THAT
ONE BITCH BACK
FOR BANGING ANTOINE.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.597
'CAUSE ANTOINE,
THAT THE ONE BITCH

18:18.639 --> 18:20.724
WENT OUT WITH MAYBE
A TOTAL OF 2 TIMES,

18:20.808 --> 18:22.267
HE'S WHO SHOT JAMAL,

18:22.309 --> 18:24.436
AND THIS WAS PAYING
HIM BACK SHOOTING
HER?

18:24.520 --> 18:27.356
YOU SEE JAMAL
IN THAT CHAIR?
YOU CALL THAT RIGHT?

18:30.901 --> 18:35.239
WHERE ARE WE GONNA
FIND THIS, UH, JACKSON
THAT SHOT THE 2 GIRLS?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.407
YOU GONNA
WORK WITH ME, RIGHT?

18:37.449 --> 18:38.659
WHAT HAVE WE
BEEN DOING?

18:40.077 --> 18:41.954
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.039
HE'S STAYING WITH
OUR COUSIN IN RICHMOND.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.917
THIS CRIPPLE JAMAL
THAT'S SUCH
A BIG MARTYR,

18:46.959 --> 18:49.211
WHAT WAS HE DOING
WHEN THOSE GIRLS
WERE GETTING RAPED

18:49.294 --> 18:50.796
IN HIS APARTMENT?

18:50.879 --> 18:53.257
HE WAS IN THE OTHER ROOM.
SAID HE DIDN'T WANT
TO WATCH.

18:54.758 --> 18:56.844
BUT HE WAS, UH,
EGGING THIS JACKSON ON

18:56.927 --> 18:58.262
TO TAKE 'EM
UP TO THAT ROOF.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.305
NAH, HE DIDN'T
SAY THAT, EITHER.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.391
JAMAL DON'T
TALK THAT MUCH.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.121
SO THESE PUNKS,
SPOOKY AND LEON,

19:24.163 --> 19:26.498
THEY'RE ON THE ROOF WHEN
THESE 2 GIRLS GET SHOT,

19:26.540 --> 19:27.958
BUT ALL THEY DID
WAS RAPE 'EM.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.170
JACKSON, THAT DIDN'T
WEAR THE SKI MASK, DID
THE ACTUAL SHOOTING.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.172
YOU GOT A PLACE
TO LOOK FOR HIM?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.590
Simone: YEAH,
RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.966
WE GOT TO CALL
THEIR JOB DOWN THERE.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.593
HOW'S THIS
FOR DEEP THINKING?

19:37.634 --> 19:38.802
THESE GIRLS
GET RAPED AND SHOT,

19:38.886 --> 19:40.012
AND THE ONE
GETS MURDERED

19:40.095 --> 19:41.388
PAYING
THE OTHER GIRL BACK

19:41.471 --> 19:44.683
'CAUSE SHE WENT OUT
2 TIMES WITH SOME
ASSHOLE NAME ANTOINE

19:44.766 --> 19:47.269
THAT SHOT THESE
IDIOTS' BUDDY JAMAL.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.564
JAMAL BEING
THE...QUADRIPLEGIC
DOWNSTAIRS?

19:50.647 --> 19:52.608
YEAH.
THE BATTERY-POWERED
DEALER.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.610
WE'RE GONNA TALK TO HIM
AFTER WE NOTIFY RICHMOND.

19:54.651 --> 19:59.990
UH, SO YOU'RE GONNA
TRY TO MOVE HIM ON
THE ORIGINAL SHOOTING?

20:00.073 --> 20:03.076
YEAH. THAT WAS 6 MONTHS
AGO WHEN THIS ANTOINE
PUT HIM IN HIS CHAIR.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.995
PROBABLY ONLY
DELAYED COMING
FOR IT UP TO NOW,

20:05.078 --> 20:07.497
HE'S WAITING
FOR A MARCH THAW.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.333
WHEN YOU
GET BACK UP HERE,

20:09.374 --> 20:11.335
I'M GONNA HAVE THIS
WHOLE THING DIAGRAMMED.

20:13.962 --> 20:17.466
THESE GUYS BETTER
NOT GIVE US NO TROUBLE.

20:17.507 --> 20:18.675
WHO?

20:18.717 --> 20:19.801
YOU KNOW...

20:19.843 --> 20:21.136
HOW'S IT GOING?

20:21.178 --> 20:22.471
FINE.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.433
RICHMOND P.D.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.601
RICHMOND P.D. IS RIGHT.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.519
BREAK OUR BALLS BEFORE
WE'LL PICK HIM UP.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.521
WHERE'S THE PAPERWORK?
THIS AND THAT.

20:31.563 --> 20:35.025
ANDY, LET'S CHECK
ANTI-CRIME FOR A PICTURE
OF THIS JACKSON,

20:35.067 --> 20:36.485
FAX IT OVER
TO RICHMOND P.D.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.237
THEN LET'S CALL
RICHMOND P.D.,

20:38.320 --> 20:40.322
AND WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT
THEIR ATTITUDE IS THEN.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.740
ALL'S I'M SAYING,

20:41.823 --> 20:44.993
GRAB THE GUY UP,
DON'T START BREAKING
OUR BALLS.

WELL...

22:34.978 --> 22:38.357
THERE'S A WITNESS PUTS
YOU LEAVING THE SCENE
LAST NIGHT.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.816
I WORK THERE.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.610
NOT AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING
YOU DON'T.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.490
SHOULD I BE ASKING
FOR A LAWYER?

22:46.531 --> 22:49.326
LOOK, WE HAVE A LOT
OF INFORMATION HERE.

22:49.409 --> 22:53.413
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
REALLY WANT TO DRAG OUT
AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.415
YOU PUT THINGS
ON THE TABLE FOR US,

22:55.499 --> 22:57.793
MAYBE WE CAN HELP
SO THINGS GO EASIER FOR YOU.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.503
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:59.586 --> 23:04.174
NOBODY'S THINKING THAT YOU
WENT DOWN TO THE CLINIC
TO CAUSE PROBLEMS.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.635
BUT WE NEED TO KNOW
HOW THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.303
WE'RE TRYING
TO HELP YOU HERE.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.347
ARE YOU?

23:10.389 --> 23:12.516
YEAH.

23:16.353 --> 23:19.189
I HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH BOB McCLURE.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.525
IT'S SOMETHING
I'M VERY ASHAMED OF.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.360
OK.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.320
WHEN I WAS
DONE BEHAVING
LIKE A DAMN FOOL,

23:25.362 --> 23:26.863
I TRIED TO END IT,

23:26.905 --> 23:29.533
BUT BOB SAID THAT
WASN'T GONNA HAPPEN,

23:29.574 --> 23:31.410
THAT HE WOULD
TELL ROLAND.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.413
BOB WOULD CALL
LATE AT NIGHT,

23:34.496 --> 23:36.331
HE'D STAND OUTSIDE
OUR APARTMENT,

23:36.373 --> 23:39.459
AND HE'D FOLLOW
ROLAND AND ME.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.753
THIS WENT ON
FOR ABOUT A MONTH.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.255
WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT?

23:43.338 --> 23:44.840
HE CALLED LAST NIGHT
3 TIMES.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.716
THE LAST
WAS AROUND 4:30.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.844
DID ROLAND
HEAR THOSE CALLS?

23:48.885 --> 23:50.679
NO.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.639
HE TAKES MEDICATION,

23:52.722 --> 23:54.391
FOR INSOMNIA.

23:56.059 --> 23:59.855
ON THE LAST CALL,
BOB TOLD ME TO COME DOWN
TO THE CLINIC, AND...

23:59.896 --> 24:02.315
I WENT, AND BOB
WAS THERE WITH A GUN.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.902
HE SAID,

24:05.944 --> 24:07.988
"VAL...

24:08.071 --> 24:09.781
"I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THIS RIGHT NOW,

24:09.865 --> 24:11.032
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LEAVE ME."

24:11.074 --> 24:12.492
THREATENING YOU.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.954
YEAH. I MEAN, HE WAS
HOLDING A GUN
WHEN HE WAS TALKING.

24:16.037 --> 24:18.165
I MEAN, HE WAS
GONNA KILL ME.

24:18.248 --> 24:21.585
AND I ALMOST DIDN'T
CARE AT FIRST.

24:24.379 --> 24:25.797
BUT THEN I JUST...

24:25.881 --> 24:29.301
I JUST GOT SO TIRED
OF EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED

24:29.384 --> 24:31.344
WITH ROLAND AND ME.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.306
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.391
HOW'D YOU GET
THE GUN FROM BOB?

24:36.433 --> 24:39.769
I TOLD HIM
THAT HE WAS RIGHT,
THAT I LOVED HIM.

24:40.937 --> 24:44.357
I WENT TO HUG HIM
AND I GRABBED THE GUN.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.152
AND WAS THAT BECAUSE
YOU WERE AFRAID
HE WAS GONNA USE IT?

24:47.235 --> 24:50.447
MAYBE.
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.657
AND IT WENT OFF.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.911
AND HE JUST FELL.

25:00.415 --> 25:02.918
WAS IT YOU WHO SCATTERED
THE DRUGS AROUND?

25:02.959 --> 25:04.419
NO, I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.463
I JUST--I JUST
WENT OUT THE BACK.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.174
YOU GET BRUCE CLAYTON
TO MAKE THE PLACE LOOK
LIKE THERE'D BEEN A ROBBERY?

25:09.257 --> 25:11.301
NO, I DIDN'T
EVEN SEE BRUCE.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.012
DID YOU KNOW THAT HE ERASED
THE SURVEILLANCE TAPE
YOU WERE ON?

25:15.847 --> 25:19.559
WHY WOULD HE GO TO SO MUCH
TROUBLE TO PROTECT YOU?

25:19.643 --> 25:21.853
I DON'T KNOW.

25:21.937 --> 25:26.274
I NEVER REALLY PAID
THAT MUCH ATTENTION
TO BRUCE.

25:26.316 --> 25:29.569
I GUESS HE WAS
TOO NICE OF A GUY.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.782
WE'LL NEED YOU
TO WRITE IT, VAL.

25:33.823 --> 25:35.992
I KNOW.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.329
YEAH, BUT WE WANT
THE GUY FOR MURDER.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.914
I GUARANTEE THERE'S
GONNA BE A WARRANT ISSUED.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.874
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

25:42.958 --> 25:43.917
"WE'RE NOT GOING OUT
WITHOUT A WARRANT,
RIGHT?"

25:44.000 --> 25:45.418
WHAT I'M ASKING IS,

25:45.502 --> 25:47.420
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING
FOR THE PAPERWORK
TO BE, UH, PROCESSED,

25:47.504 --> 25:48.880
CAN YOU SET UP

25:48.964 --> 25:50.840
NO, 'CAUSE THEY'D
HAVE TO GET OFF
THEIR FAT ASSES

25:50.924 --> 25:52.425
AND OUT INTO
THE FRESH AIR.

25:52.509 --> 25:53.510
