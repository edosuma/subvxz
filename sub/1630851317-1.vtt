00:04.917 --> 00:06.354
Hello?

00:06.397 --> 00:07.224
E karo,Abishola.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.573
We need to talk about Dele's

00:08.617 --> 00:09.879
travel arrangements.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.317
I think it's best if Dele stays
in Nigeria with me.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.841
You would have him miss
his own mother's wedding?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.060
Actually...

00:17.104 --> 00:19.236
I was talking
about more than a wedding.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.847
I think he should stay here
for the foreseeable future.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.545
Put Dele on!

00:23.588 --> 00:24.850
I know this is hard to hear,

00:24.894 --> 00:26.113
but this is where he belongs.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.505
Tayo!

00:27.549 --> 00:29.377
Put my son on the phone
right now!

00:30.465 --> 00:31.640
Hold on.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.685
What's going on?

00:33.729 --> 00:35.426
He's trying to keep Dele
in Nigeria.

00:35.470 --> 00:36.471
For the wedding?Forever.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.908
Oluwa mi o.

00:38.951 --> 00:39.822
Hey.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.432
We're gonna
bring Dele home.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.347
Yes. We are.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.829
I don't want you to worry.

00:46.872 --> 00:49.005
Olu and I will be there
to fight for you.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.659
Isn't that right, Olu?

00:50.702 --> 00:53.183
Shh! I'm watching The Avengers.

Ooh, steamy, huh?

01:09.156 --> 01:11.158
It is Africa, Bob.

01:11.201 --> 01:14.117
So, what's the plan?
Settle in, shower, get Dele?

01:14.161 --> 01:15.162
Take another shower?

01:15.205 --> 01:16.902
We are going straight to Dele.

01:17.903 --> 01:20.036
I was trying to do you
a favor, but okay.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.952
Bob, did you perhaps
pack a scarf

01:22.995 --> 01:25.172
or a concealing hat
you could wear?

01:25.215 --> 01:27.696
Uncle, it's 105
degrees in here.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.133
It's taking all my
willpower to keep pants on.

01:30.177 --> 01:33.658
It is too late, he has already
caught the eye of the guard.

01:34.485 --> 01:36.139
Because I'm not
wearing a scarf?

01:36.183 --> 01:38.272
Because you are
the only white person here.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.362
They're profiling me.
Well, I guess it's only fair

01:41.405 --> 01:42.841
I get a taste
of it for once.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.843
Oh, no, your white privilege

01:44.887 --> 01:46.932
is still accepted
here in Nigeria.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.804
Like a Platinum Card.

01:48.847 --> 01:51.241
Sir, please step
out of line.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.330
No problem, okay.
All right.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.378
Bob Wheeler.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.293
Open the bag, sir.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.425
Tunde, do something.

02:01.469 --> 02:04.733
Uh, sir, I can vouch
for this man.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.735
Okay, then you can
also open your bag.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.564
Young man,
I am Nigerian.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.087
I know what
this is all about.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.872
I will not be bribing
my way into my own country.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.527
In fact, I was born
in this very building.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.660
My mother's
water broke exactly

02:18.703 --> 02:20.531
in the spot you are
standing now.

02:20.575 --> 02:22.533
Is that so?

02:22.577 --> 02:25.101
Because this airport
was built in 1979.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.147
Open your case.

02:29.975 --> 02:32.456
Just for the record, I think
you're doing a bang-up job.

["Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola

02:58.482 --> 03:00.223
I cannot believe you!

03:00.267 --> 03:03.183
Nigerians never pay
the airport bribe.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.445
You didn't pay it, I did.

03:04.488 --> 03:05.620
But I was with you.

by proxy.

for her and Uncle.

03:13.018 --> 03:14.803
Wait, we aren't going together?

03:14.846 --> 03:17.545
We have to stop and pick up
gifts for our relatives.

03:17.588 --> 03:20.852
Didn't you send Dele with, like,
four suitcases worth of stuff?

03:20.896 --> 03:23.377
Yes, but if a child
brought four,

to explore our city.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.237
But listen well well.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.586
Never go by yourself.

and I tell you the price.

the decision

09:39.840 --> 09:41.363

any more mistakes.

the same way afterwards,

anything to drink?

for refreshments.

And a lemon-flavored
sparkling water if you have it.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.710
You have every reason
to be upset with me.

10:23.753 --> 10:24.972
I know I do.

10:25.015 --> 10:27.278
It has been wonderful
having Dele here.

10:27.322 --> 10:28.628
And as you saw,

10:28.671 --> 10:30.238
his sisters idolize him.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.501
Eh, they can idolize
him over Skype!

10:33.676 --> 10:35.547
But he has reconnected
with his family,

10:35.591 --> 10:36.766
with his culture.

10:36.810 --> 10:37.767
Fine.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.464
When I shout at him in Detroit,

10:39.508 --> 10:42.163
I will do it in Yoruba.

of his future.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.690
he needs to be
in the best schools.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.561
You think I do not know that?

10:49.605 --> 10:51.563
She knows that.

10:51.607 --> 10:54.175
Well, he has been accepted

10:54.218 --> 10:56.481
into the
British International School.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.048
That is impossible.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.659
For most people.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.138
But I made a phone call,

11:01.182 --> 11:03.619
and he was allowed
to take the entrance exam.

11:04.881 --> 11:07.275
And of course he passed.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.886
It is a testament to the work
you have done raising him.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.935
I have to think about this.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.894
May I use the bathroom, please?

11:17.938 --> 11:19.853
Yes. Down the hall.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.115
Third door on your left.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.073
Excuse me.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.557
It was a nice try.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.298
What do you mean?

11:30.341 --> 11:31.386
This.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.040
Your big, fancy house,

11:33.083 --> 11:35.042
all that talk
about Dele's future.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.608
All I want to do is provide

11:36.652 --> 11:38.262
a good life for my son.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.438
Yeah, well,
Abishola's already doing that.

11:40.482 --> 11:43.311
Are you telling me
schools in Detroit are better?

11:46.314 --> 11:48.403
I-I don't have that data
in front of me,

11:48.446 --> 11:50.622
but, hey, let's look it up
on my cell phone.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.581
Uh, what's the Wi-Fi password?

11:52.624 --> 11:53.974
One, two, three, four.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.584
Uh, you crazy millennials

11:55.627 --> 11:56.933
and your complicated passwords.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.587
Here, you put it in. Here.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.425
Abishola has Dele![all cheering]

12:10.468 --> 12:11.426
Thank God.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.428
Because she has kidnapped him.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.908
NURSES:
Ooh...What?

12:14.951 --> 12:16.561
Head for the Ghanaian border.

12:16.605 --> 12:17.911
You're sending her to Ghana?

12:17.954 --> 12:19.608
I have a former lover there.
Long story.

12:19.651 --> 12:20.957
Good story.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.829
You will have
to take a boat

12:22.872 --> 12:24.787
to bypass Benin and Togo.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.136
Can't she just fly home?

12:26.180 --> 12:28.269
Have you been a fugitive before?

12:28.312 --> 12:30.358
No.Then stop talking.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.404
Your mother's house?
That is the first place

12:33.448 --> 12:34.623
he will look for you.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.233
The border, Abishola!

12:36.277 --> 12:38.235
Head for the border!

12:39.193 --> 12:41.717
[indistinct chatter]

12:46.461 --> 12:48.463
[chickens clucking]

12:48.506 --> 12:49.943
Did you get everything?

12:49.986 --> 12:50.944
Yes.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.815
At the prices I wanted.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.469
Then what is wrong?

12:55.949 --> 12:57.864
Nobody would play with me.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.084
They would just pull up
the price on Amazon

13:01.128 --> 13:03.043
to show me the deal
I was getting.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.435
I know the deal

13:04.479 --> 13:06.394
I was getting!

13:06.437 --> 13:07.961
It is not the same market

13:08.004 --> 13:09.789
it was 20 years ago.

13:09.832 --> 13:13.053
What is the world coming to
when no one will argue over

13:13.096 --> 13:15.838
the price of a refurbished
Sony Discman?

13:20.060 --> 13:22.018
Was this the
plan all along?

13:22.062 --> 13:23.933
Distract me
so you can steal my son?

13:23.977 --> 13:26.240
"Plan"? We basically
hopped on a plane.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.895
You'll notice I'm not exactly
dressed for the weather.

13:30.026 --> 13:32.159
[cell phone ringing]

13:32.202 --> 13:33.595
Hello?

13:33.638 --> 13:36.380
WOMAN: May I speak
to Mr. Tayo Adebambo?

13:36.424 --> 13:37.425
Speaking.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.643
This is the American Embassy.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.036
We have some questions

13:40.080 --> 13:42.909
regarding your recent
visit to the United States.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.694
Excuse me, who
am I speaking to?

13:47.087 --> 13:49.698
My name is Jennifer Aniston.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.134
Good name.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.962
Mrs. Aniston,
is it possible

13:53.006 --> 13:55.443
that we reschedule
for another day?

13:55.486 --> 13:56.966
No! It has to be right now!

13:57.010 --> 13:59.316
You have to come
to our office in Abuja.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.536
But Abuja is
11 hours away.

14:01.579 --> 14:02.885
Can you tell me

14:02.929 --> 14:04.887
what this is regarding?Um...

14:04.931 --> 14:07.324
Why are you arguing
with the American Embassy?

14:07.368 --> 14:10.371
Get yourself to Abuja
and leave Abishola alone!

14:13.722 --> 14:15.898
Sounds legit to me.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.034
Abishola!

14:21.077 --> 14:22.862
Open the door!
Calm down.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.080
I will not calm down.

14:24.124 --> 14:26.604
She has my son.All right, fair enough.

14:27.562 --> 14:30.434
Hey, how do I look?What?

14:30.478 --> 14:31.740
Well, I'm about to meet
my future mother-in-law.

14:31.783 --> 14:32.872
I want to look presentable.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.225
Eh.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.010
E kaale, Ma.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.229
E kaale,Tayo.

14:42.272 --> 14:43.883
E kaale, Ma.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.014
E kaale,Bob.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.929
May I speak to Abishola?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.061
No.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.932
This is my house,
you may speak to me.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.803
And what a lovely home
it is.

14:51.847 --> 14:52.935
Shh!

14:52.979 --> 14:54.850
Your daughter has stolen my son

14:54.894 --> 14:56.417
and she's going to take him
back to America.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.548
I know this.

14:57.592 --> 14:58.941
You told me yourself
you're happy

14:58.985 --> 15:00.551
to Dele back in Nigeria.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.771
I did.So can I please come in?

15:02.814 --> 15:04.294
No. Even though I agree

15:04.338 --> 15:06.427
Dele should stay here,
I have to stand by

15:06.470 --> 15:09.517
my daughter's stupid
and selfish decisions.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.259
Oh, you and my mom are
gonna get along just fine.

15:13.216 --> 15:16.132
[shouting, clamoring]

15:17.264 --> 15:19.048
Tunde, hey!

15:19.092 --> 15:20.920
How long has it been? Come in!Too long.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.660
Come inside! Eh-eh.

15:22.704 --> 15:23.966
"Eh-eh" what?

15:24.010 --> 15:25.533
We have not had
a formal introduction

15:25.576 --> 15:26.621
between you and my family.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.057
Until then,

15:28.101 --> 15:30.320
you cannot step foot
in this house.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.065
Aren't we a fine pair?

15:38.285 --> 15:40.243
Hey, want to get
something to eat?

15:40.287 --> 15:42.332
[grunts]

15:47.033 --> 15:49.209
This is not
what I wanted.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.646
Really? You and me
tooling around Lagos?

15:51.689 --> 15:53.996
That's not
what you had in mind?

15:55.302 --> 15:57.608
The first time I held
Dele in my arms,

15:57.652 --> 16:00.176
I knew it was my mission to
teach him and provide for him.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.309
And then you left.

16:02.352 --> 16:04.615
Because I could not
support him in America.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.095
But with Dele here,

16:06.139 --> 16:08.010
I was finally able
to be the father

16:08.054 --> 16:09.229
I've always wanted to be.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.796
He's a great kid.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.190
Yes. He is.

16:16.453 --> 16:18.586
I wanted to have this
discussion with Abishola,

16:18.629 --> 16:21.023
but you know how
hardheaded she is.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.416
[chuckles]
Yeah.

16:22.459 --> 16:23.591
She is immoveable.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.071
Like Olumo Rock.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.160
It was a 15-hour flight.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.683
I read a couple guidebooks.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.948
But, honestly, that's the reason
I fell in love with her.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.124
Me, too.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.390
Thanks for the ride.
I'm... glad

16:40.434 --> 16:42.088
we're finally getting
the chance to talk.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.786
Perhaps now you understand
how much I care.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.441
I do.

16:47.484 --> 16:48.833
And why I will
not allow you

16:48.877 --> 16:51.532
or anyone to leave
Nigeria with my son.

16:51.575 --> 16:54.317
Ah, we were doing so good here
and now you ruined it.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.798
[phone ringing]

16:56.841 --> 16:58.495
It's a work call.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.497
Hey, not a good time.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.152
Dele is thriving in Lagos.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.372
The way he was playing
with his sisters...

17:05.415 --> 17:07.374
I've never seen him so happy.

17:07.417 --> 17:10.290
How can I take that away?

17:10.333 --> 17:11.639
What are you saying?

17:11.682 --> 17:14.337
Here he will attend
the best school,

17:14.381 --> 17:16.426
and be around people
who share his culture.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.429
But he won't have you.

17:20.778 --> 17:23.259
I have always done
what's best for him.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.958
I cannot let this be
the one time I do not.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.701
You're amazing.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.181
I love you very much.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.096
We'll talk later tonight, okay?

17:36.272 --> 17:38.883
You are awfully close
to your employees.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.494
You're damn right
I am.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.805
Abishola and Bob are
getting married in Nigeria!

17:47.849 --> 17:49.677
[cheering, clamoring]

17:49.720 --> 17:51.853
Because Dele is not coming home!

17:51.896 --> 17:53.724
[confused noises]Huh? What?

18:01.906 --> 18:03.430
Now hold on.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.909
We are guests
in this country,

18:04.953 --> 18:07.086
and I would like
to be treated as such.

18:07.129 --> 18:10.263
I will not be shaken down!

18:10.306 --> 18:12.874
Madame, there is no
need to make a scene.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.223
I agree.

18:14.267 --> 18:17.183
Nobody's smuggling
anything here.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.489
Hey.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.925
Okay, okay, guys, just-just

18:20.969 --> 18:22.884
let me handle this, okay?

18:36.767 --> 18:38.508
[speaking Yoruba]

18:38.552 --> 18:40.075
CHRISTINA:
Oh, Kemi, hey!

18:40.119 --> 18:41.294
A little help here?
