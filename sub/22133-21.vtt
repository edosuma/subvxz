says you won't interview for my show

08:39.490 --> 08:43.538
look man don't take it personally it's
just that I don't believe it a lifeguard

08:43.538 --> 08:47.110
she's singled out for doing what we all
do here every day now if you want to

08:47.110 --> 08:50.350
give credit to everyone and to the
training center that'd be great

08:50.350 --> 08:53.889
we could really use the publicity all
right maybe we'll do a feature on your

08:53.889 --> 08:57.310
Center when I get back from my business
trip on the mainland next week in the

08:57.309 --> 09:01.838
meantime I understand from your friend
Brian that you start your vacation

09:01.839 --> 09:03.069
tomorrow

09:03.068 --> 09:07.059
that's right well I've spoken to the
management at hilton hawaiian village

09:07.059 --> 09:10.149

at no charge

09:10.149 --> 09:14.799
whatever you need a massage Jim
privileges food drink even a sweet

09:15.339 --> 09:19.930
that's a very kind offer a guarantee and
thank you but I already live at the hill

09:19.929 --> 09:24.219
we're aware of that but not completely
gratis in an ocean suite right

09:24.759 --> 09:28.028
it's a way for them and for me to say
thank you

09:28.830 --> 09:33.990
again thanks but it's not necessary if
you do the story on the center that

09:33.990 --> 09:35.430
that'd be really enough

09:35.429 --> 09:39.419
well suit yourself but the offers there
for a week all you have to do is ask for

09:39.419 --> 09:40.199

class service at the heavy-duty Hawaiian

09:57.299 --> 10:02.219

16:36.429 --> 16:38.469
these races over the years

27:00.680 --> 27:01.850
bust my chops

27:01.849 --> 27:06.139

thinking blue wrong got to be red oceans

27:29.509 --> 27:30.019
blue

27:30.019 --> 27:33.019
you don't want to disappear out there

27:33.619 --> 27:38.839
I'm looks right though hey get enough
monkeys and typewriters you might get

27:38.839 --> 27:41.839

27:43.359 --> 27:45.240
you know the brush

27:45.240 --> 27:47.460
take mine

27:47.460 --> 27:51.569
of course with the name of the boat
being elisa kind of hard for me to keep

27:51.569 --> 27:56.730
pretending she's not part of the whole
thing you know Brian told me a little

27:56.730 --> 28:00.509
bit about her that she can handle canoe
all right

28:00.509 --> 28:08.099
oh yeah she was a real Waterman wasn't
for her sensitive currents and the wind

28:08.099 --> 28:12.418
and the whole world around her she could
feel everything

28:13.288 --> 28:16.288
it was like the whole of life

28:16.288 --> 28:19.288
wash through her like the waves

28:21.048 --> 28:22.089
so

28:22.089 --> 28:25.089
when I lost her I lost everything

28:25.809 --> 28:28.428
race my life

28:28.429 --> 28:31.429
everything

28:33.119 --> 28:36.119
heard you lost your son while back

28:37.740 --> 28:38.789
yeah

28:38.789 --> 28:41.789
yeah I did

28:42.710 --> 28:45.710
pretty much finished me off for a long
time but um

28:49.548 --> 28:53.359
like he said it my kind of washed
through him - so he's

28:54.049 --> 28:57.049

28:58.009 --> 29:01.849
