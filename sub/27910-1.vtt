00:39.375 --> 00:41.809
Never mind.
What?

00:41.833 --> 00:43.476
Never mind, we can't go in now.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.601
How do you know?

00:44.625 --> 00:45.726
You what?

00:45.750 --> 00:47.184
How do you know?

00:47.208 --> 00:49.476
Wo, wo, wo.
No, come on.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.851
No, that is such bullshit
that you can die from this,

00:51.875 --> 00:53.309
it's actually very
good for your skin.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.642
Up my nose.
Shit foam up my nose.

00:55.666 --> 00:58.851
It really bothers you, does it?

00:58.875 --> 01:01.059
What?
Just a bit of foam,

01:01.083 --> 01:03.559
on your face right now.

01:03.583 --> 01:08.101
Would you like that.

01:11.625 --> 01:14.267
Alright, go on then.
If you can't jump in the sea

01:14.291 --> 01:16.434
Right.
Then we're gonna go for a quick run.

01:16.458 --> 01:19.309
Wait a minute.
I'm coming there now, right.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.392
Come on, sweetheart.
I'm coming.

01:21.416 --> 01:23.642
You can do it.
You can do it!

01:25.875 --> 01:27.517
Alright, I've got it.
Take it easy.

01:27.541 --> 01:29.226
I've got it, it's alright.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.767
You won't fall,
look at me, I've got this.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.726
Come on, Oliver.
Alright, it's just like that.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.333
What are you doing?
I just slipped.

01:37.791 --> 01:39.226
Cheater. Look.

01:39.250 --> 01:41.892
It's so beautiful up here.
Yeah.

01:41.916 --> 01:42.791
Ahh.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.458
I love living here.

01:59.750 --> 02:03.291
It's just...
It's perfect for me.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.184
I love getting up in
the morning and being able

02:06.208 --> 02:10.184
to just come out here, see this,

02:10.208 --> 02:12.726
go back home, keep writing.

02:12.750 --> 02:16.309
It's like, it's the dream.
Yeah.

02:16.333 --> 02:19.601
I mean I know that living here
is not full of opportunity,

02:19.625 --> 02:23.726
but in terms of being an artist,
and in terms of atmosphere

02:23.750 --> 02:26.434
and in terms
of inspiration, this...

02:26.458 --> 02:29.226
There's nowhere else.
There's nowhere else for me.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.017
New York, L.A.,
whatever, these big cities,

02:32.041 --> 02:35.601
that's, that's of course, London.
These are the places where,

02:35.625 --> 02:37.434
you know,
if you really want to get

02:37.458 --> 02:38.684
your career off the ground

02:38.708 --> 02:41.392
but I'm not quite there yet.

02:41.416 --> 02:44.142
Lots of people work
out of Cardiff as well.

02:44.166 --> 02:47.226
Figured you could commute
to Cardiff from here,

02:47.250 --> 02:49.059
you could still,
have all of this.

02:49.083 --> 02:49.958
Yeah.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.976
It's brilliant for kids here.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.184
That's my only gripe with it.

02:59.208 --> 03:01.184
If I could change it,
it would just be,

03:01.208 --> 03:04.541
a few less
families here, less kids.

03:05.916 --> 03:08.017
You know, it is getting
a bit crowded.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.833
Why? Why? What is the...

04:22.458 --> 04:24.809
Oh, god!
What the hell are you doing?

04:24.833 --> 04:26.476
What are you doing? I'm just
cleaning my teeth, babe.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.976
Why do you have to.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.601
God, just do it normally.

04:32.875 --> 04:34.351
No, it's just...

04:34.375 --> 04:37.684
No, no, no, no,
do not! No!

04:37.708 --> 04:39.666
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:42.208 --> 04:44.684
No, I don't like it.

04:44.708 --> 04:47.666
Can you just cuddle me? Please.
Okay.

04:50.250 --> 04:52.684
That's nice.
Yeah?

04:52.708 --> 04:53.916
Mmm.

04:58.791 --> 05:01.041
You told my mother
to fuck off last night.

05:06.125 --> 05:10.851
All I told her was that we needed to establish
some boundaries, that's all I said.

05:10.875 --> 05:14.642
Yeah, but you're late
though, what's the hold up for?

05:14.666 --> 05:17.142
Janet, hi, sorry. It's...
Here we go.

05:17.166 --> 05:19.476
Hi, it's Gillian.
Did you break down?

05:19.500 --> 05:20.892
Are you on the way
or what's the...

05:20.916 --> 05:22.059
No, we're not late.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.059
I'm sorry, we're not coming,

05:23.083 --> 05:24.476
did he not tell you?

05:24.500 --> 05:25.892
When could I? I was...

05:25.916 --> 05:27.809
Can you stop calling my husband

05:27.833 --> 05:29.767
at this time of night?

05:29.791 --> 05:31.767
No, I know we're not at dinner.

05:31.791 --> 05:34.017
I know we're not at dinner.
I know it's not that late,

05:34.041 --> 05:36.642
but it's my husband,
and at some point

05:36.666 --> 05:40.601
you need to understand
that I'm the woman in his life

05:40.625 --> 05:45.059
and that sometimes I want, to
stay home with my grown husband.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.684
Why don't you just give
me the phone back now.

05:46.708 --> 05:48.892
No, no, you're not going
to speak to your son.

05:48.916 --> 05:52.000
This is a sick,
sick relationship.

05:52.958 --> 05:54.601
You're going to have to
sort that out.

05:54.625 --> 05:57.101
There's a shit storm
coming of your making.

05:57.125 --> 05:58.892
Of all day yesterday,
you were a bit...

05:58.916 --> 06:00.726
Let's be honest,
you started off.

06:00.750 --> 06:03.017
And it might have
been a bit of me,

06:03.041 --> 06:07.392
but you were a bit touchy
with all the bin stuff.

06:07.416 --> 06:09.101
Do you know that, how easy

06:09.125 --> 06:11.476
it would have been
for you to just say

06:11.500 --> 06:16.184
"thanks, thanks, Gillian, that was
so nice of you to let me sleep in

06:16.208 --> 06:18.684
and to take out
the trash for me." I mean,

06:18.708 --> 06:22.976
"wow, next time,
you sleep in, Gillian,

06:23.000 --> 06:27.017
you sleep in
and I'll do everything else."

06:27.041 --> 06:30.809
No don't pull that card on me now.
I have to work at night. Yeah.

06:30.833 --> 06:32.809
I'm really sorry, that's what
I have to do, but sometimes

06:32.833 --> 06:34.684
I sleep in.
Yeah, and then I say you do have work

06:34.708 --> 06:36.309
but you didn't have
work last night.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.500
If you're up all night.

06:39.791 --> 06:42.392
Don't even, I didn't even...
It was a...

06:42.416 --> 06:44.267
It was going to be
a fucking slap in the head.

06:44.291 --> 06:45.934
It was a...

06:45.958 --> 06:48.434
We both should be
doing a bigger job right now.

06:48.458 --> 06:51.767
Job? I think I'm the one
with a job though, ain't I?

06:51.791 --> 06:54.267
I'm the one who goes out
and earns money.

06:54.291 --> 06:58.101
Yes, you get paid
your whatever it is

06:58.125 --> 07:00.684
100 quid, I don't know.
150.

07:00.708 --> 07:02.392
150. 150 minimum.
What am I paying for?

07:02.416 --> 07:04.434
The food, the roof
over our head.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.267
Not the roof over
our head, are you?

07:06.291 --> 07:09.476
Well, no, well, bills.
I'm paying for the bills,

07:09.500 --> 07:12.309
but actually, you know what, I kind of
I'm paying for the roof over our head,

07:12.333 --> 07:14.476
because who does it?
It's my mom.

07:14.500 --> 07:18.142
It's not your mom, it's my mom.

07:18.166 --> 07:23.726
It is a bit weird that we live in a
roof that your mom has paid for.

07:23.750 --> 07:28.142
You know what, why don't we just go and
do our work that your mom gave us.

07:28.166 --> 07:32.892
Okay, so I would like, first of
all, everyone off stage. Off stage,

07:32.916 --> 07:35.476
because I want to start
from the top. That way.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.892
Which way?
That way? Yeah.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.392
Who put the
fucking flowers there?

07:39.416 --> 07:40.559
Look, in this place,

07:40.583 --> 07:42.184
ran Cassius' dagger through.

07:42.208 --> 07:44.142
See what a rant the
envious casca made.

07:44.166 --> 07:47.767
And Tonya go.
Love is merely a madness.

07:47.791 --> 07:51.392
Craig, don't stop. Don't stop.
Do you want me to stop?

07:51.416 --> 07:54.559
Just listen... no, I want you guys to keep going,
just listen to me, just do it. Just do it.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.392
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.
And, I tell you,

07:56.416 --> 07:57.976
deserves as well as
a dark house and a whip

07:58.000 --> 08:00.476
through this the well-beloved

08:00.500 --> 08:02.642
And as he
plucked his cursed steel away.

08:02.666 --> 08:04.559
Mark how the blood of Caesar
followed it,

08:04.583 --> 08:06.267
as rushing out of doors...

08:06.291 --> 08:09.101
What are you doing there?
What are you reading?

08:09.125 --> 08:11.267
It's just Julius Caesar,
but this is utterly pointless

08:11.291 --> 08:13.517
'cos you can't hear us all
at the same time, can you?

08:13.541 --> 08:16.142
No, but that's the point. I don't want
to hear you all at the same time.

08:16.166 --> 08:19.017
I want to hear the ambiance of the sound.
It's a warm-up for me,

08:19.041 --> 08:21.059
it's a warm-up for me, okay?
I just got in here.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.142
You should have warmed up before
you came to rehearsal just like I did.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.767
Are you saying to me
what I should have done?

08:24.791 --> 08:26.434
What's with everyone
being so fucking

08:26.458 --> 08:29.434
aggressive this morning?
I don't understand.

08:29.458 --> 08:32.291
What happened to everyone this morning.
I was fine!

08:33.250 --> 08:35.642
You know what, if you don't want
to listen to me, then don't.

08:35.666 --> 08:37.416
Do what you think it should be
and I'll watch.

08:40.375 --> 08:43.851
From women's eyes
this doctrine I derive

08:43.875 --> 08:49.517
they sparkle still the right
Promethean fire;.

08:49.541 --> 08:50.684
Hi.

08:50.708 --> 08:53.976
Hi, I'm Rachel, oh, my god.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.726
Sorry, we don't have
the space for another actor.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.892
No, that's Rachel. It's not
another actor, it's Rachel, isn't it?

08:59.916 --> 09:01.976
It's not one of those...
Come you, carry on.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.434
Hi.

09:03.458 --> 09:05.101
Come here.
Go on, do it.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.559
How are you?
I'm good, how are you?

09:10.583 --> 09:11.934
Really good.
I can't believe this.

09:11.958 --> 09:14.226
Sorry, I thought that you

09:14.250 --> 09:18.142
were an actor because you were on
the stage and I was like "oh".

09:18.166 --> 09:20.309
Sorry, we go back.

09:20.333 --> 09:23.392
We do. And we used to do this
Shakespeare thing at school.

09:23.416 --> 09:25.434
Do you remember when we had to pair up...
Of course I do

09:25.458 --> 09:27.142
and do the speech and I just...
Of course!

09:27.166 --> 09:29.101
Thought it would
be a funny thing.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.392
So I just got up there
and it's quite scary

09:31.416 --> 09:33.392
when you have all the
lights on you and stuff.

09:33.416 --> 09:36.375
Yeah, well, that's why you
have to be trained as an actor.

09:37.833 --> 09:40.392
Guys, I'm really sorry,
I know, this one...

09:40.416 --> 09:42.851
I did not foresee this.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.267
And, yeah I'm sure
you're really good

09:45.291 --> 09:49.767
and I'd love to hear...
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive,

09:49.791 --> 09:53.976
to sparkle still the
great Promethean fire.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.684
Wow! We're not
doing that one now.

09:56.708 --> 09:58.101
We're not doing that one.

09:58.125 --> 09:59.392
Right, I'm sorry, guys.

09:59.416 --> 10:00.642
I'm so sorry, this is the day.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.601
The paid ones, they're like,

10:02.625 --> 10:05.351
stood there, like reading it.
She didn't even have a book

10:05.375 --> 10:07.809
and she knew it all, when she came on...
Stop that now!

10:07.833 --> 10:10.517
What? Why don't we just go
and call that Rachel now.

10:10.541 --> 10:12.976
We go and take a picture of her
and blow it out really big

10:13.000 --> 10:15.392
and I'll print like,
five fucking thousands of them.

10:15.416 --> 10:18.601
And we just have Rachel
be the poster!

10:18.625 --> 10:20.517
And then we just put
Shakespeare over and

10:20.541 --> 10:22.101
it's just Rachel it'll be like...

10:22.125 --> 10:23.309
You know, and then underneath

10:23.333 --> 10:24.559
I put... we just putting

10:24.583 --> 10:26.809
a tiny, tiny, tiny, bit little

10:26.833 --> 10:29.767
give me a little corner
that says "by Gillian".

10:29.791 --> 10:33.392
By Gillian blah blah, I'm just
like "fuck my last name. Fuck it."

10:33.416 --> 10:35.351
Shall I let it fall off the end.
I think she'll look great.

10:35.375 --> 10:36.476
Now you're just taking the piss

10:36.500 --> 10:37.976
I was trying to help then,

10:38.000 --> 10:39.250
just selling
tickets for your thing.

10:40.750 --> 10:42.476
You were probably dropping
bombs yesterday, weren't you?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.517
"Everything's going alright
let's have a chat with my dad."

10:44.541 --> 10:46.267
"He's cool because he is."

10:46.291 --> 10:50.059
You have a go at my mom
with that stab me.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.101
Jimmy, did you meet Rachel?

10:55.541 --> 10:57.517
Darling David.

10:57.541 --> 11:02.726
We're so full tonight. I hate
to be the bearer of bad news.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.351
I'm so proud.
Ollie, I'm dying!

11:04.375 --> 11:05.767
You've done something really
important

11:05.791 --> 11:07.726
and special, and meaningful.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.767
Any mother-in-law
would be proud of you.

11:09.791 --> 11:10.892
Yeah.

11:14.958 --> 11:16.892
Hold your wife.

11:16.916 --> 11:19.976
Is she okay?
I don't know if she's okay.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.041
If you won't help me...

11:24.875 --> 11:26.601
I'll save you, Gillian.

11:26.625 --> 11:28.059
She's killing herself.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.833
Oh no, she's dying.

11:32.166 --> 11:36.726
I loved you.
All I did was love you.

11:36.750 --> 11:40.851
Her guts are on the floor,
let's put them back in. Sorry.

11:40.875 --> 11:47.476
I'm sorry. I was not doing that.
I was just being stupid.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.517
A bit of a drama queen, isn't she?
It's what she does.

11:49.541 --> 11:51.851
But she loves it.
Yeah, she does, she loves it,

11:51.875 --> 11:54.226
but she's done all of this, mind.
Did she?

11:54.250 --> 11:56.726
Yeah, she did all of that.
Hello, how are you?

11:56.750 --> 11:58.017
Come in here
and doing her thing.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.059
Ollie's father.

11:59.083 --> 12:00.184
Are you around tonight

12:00.208 --> 12:01.892
to come around for dinner?

12:01.916 --> 12:03.892
David, are we around tonight?

12:03.916 --> 12:05.726
Can we go to Clara and dicks

12:05.750 --> 12:07.309
with her and the rest
of the family?

12:07.333 --> 12:09.184
Oh.
We're doing ribs.

12:09.208 --> 12:10.726
Who?
Ribs.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.642
Oh ribs, sorry,
thank you very much.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.142
Are you coming, Ollie pop?

12:14.166 --> 12:16.226
Oh!
Oh yeah, I'm going.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.267
Ah, good, good.
Yeah.

12:18.291 --> 12:19.101
Thank god for that.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.101
And then make me

12:20.125 --> 12:21.250
not go to that meal?

12:22.208 --> 12:23.851
You were, you stopped me.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.809
Are you... "Making you
not go to that meal"?

12:26.833 --> 12:29.767
We've got to sell some tickets.
You said sorry to me.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.976
I did.
You said sorry and then it was so nice that

12:32.000 --> 12:33.601
we decided to stay in.
And we stayed...

12:33.625 --> 12:36.809
You offered to stay,
I'm making you go.

12:36.833 --> 12:39.142
Suddenly, we're right
back here, aren't we?

12:39.166 --> 12:40.267
We're right back.

12:40.291 --> 12:41.851
Lots of people know her.

12:41.875 --> 12:46.226
Can you stop?
Please stop this, okay?

12:46.250 --> 12:48.767
It is not cool that you
make this whole thing

12:48.791 --> 12:50.101
about motherfucking Rachel.

12:55.541 --> 12:56.958
MIKE.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.392
The Shakespeare
extravaganza is off.

13:01.416 --> 13:04.642
What do you mean off?
We've had some serious health

13:04.666 --> 13:07.976
and safety issues at the theater today.
The theater is closed,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.351
I'm up to my fucking
eyeballs here, mate.

13:10.375 --> 13:14.142
Okay, before you say the theater
is... before you all get all...

13:14.166 --> 13:18.642
"The theater is closed," how long
is it going to take to fix it?

13:18.666 --> 13:23.642
God, we're talking about at
least two, three weeks minimum.

13:23.666 --> 13:26.434
Three weeks. See, he's probably
going to show in four days, mate.

13:26.458 --> 13:30.101
But you can't...
Hold up, what?

13:30.125 --> 13:34.517
I'm not putting the lives of the public
at risk. I'm sorry, but this is it.

13:34.541 --> 13:37.059
I'm going to jump in the Van now.
Shit, yeah.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.684
I'm up to my ankles in shit.

13:38.708 --> 13:41.101
Oh, my god!
I can't come there.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.517
Of course you can, I can't get there
you got to drive me down there.

13:43.541 --> 13:45.434
I didn't realize what time
it is, I have a meeting.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.976
Gillian's going to drive me

13:47.000 --> 13:48.601
down there now in the Van
but I have... have...

13:48.625 --> 13:50.101
I'll speak to you
in a minute, okay?

13:50.125 --> 13:51.559
Okay, on the way, on the way.

13:51.583 --> 13:54.267
Okay, I'm going.
Bye. Come on.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.851
I'm not driving you
down there now.

13:55.875 --> 13:57.226
I actually do have a meeting.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.434
Schedule it again. Change it.

13:58.458 --> 13:59.601
I've been preparing for this.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.101
I've already redrafted the play,

14:01.125 --> 14:03.267
for this very meeting.
I have to go.

14:03.291 --> 14:04.892
There's sewage seeping

14:04.916 --> 14:06.142
all through the place.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.642
Seepage were the words he said.

14:07.666 --> 14:09.184
Yes.
It's going to be everywhere,

14:09.208 --> 14:11.434
so we can't really just...
I'm going.

14:11.458 --> 14:13.517
No, you can't just go like that.
Where do you think you're going?

14:13.541 --> 14:16.767
Come on!
What are they gonna...

14:16.791 --> 14:18.166
How I'm I going to
get down there now?

14:20.041 --> 14:22.101
You're going to leave
me here like this?

14:22.125 --> 14:24.601
How I'm I
going to get to Mike's?

14:24.625 --> 14:26.684
Sorry?
Are you seriously just going to leave me

14:26.708 --> 14:28.476
here now, knowing you're just
going to leave now? Yeah.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.267
You're just going to drive away now?
Yeah.

14:30.291 --> 14:32.125
But I love you.
What? You've got to be...

14:33.958 --> 14:35.184
She's but...

14:38.958 --> 14:40.184
You...

14:56.291 --> 14:58.226
Oll? What?

14:58.250 --> 15:00.041
I don't know.

15:01.833 --> 15:06.059
I've been walking like...
And you just been...

15:06.083 --> 15:07.476
Sitting.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.184
Hi.
Hiya.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.726
Hi, hi you.
Hi.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.976
Look I'm...
You're so funny.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.517
I just want to say
to you straight away

15:15.541 --> 15:17.601
I'm so sorry

15:17.625 --> 15:19.684
that we couldn't make it
last night. I'm so sorry.

15:19.708 --> 15:24.767
Not cool. I knew it was going
to be not cool, but as well.

15:24.791 --> 15:28.666
One cooks and shops
and chops and marinades, and...

15:30.250 --> 15:31.434
Six hours.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.666
Delicious sticky barbecue sauce.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.184
I'm joking.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.226
I don't give a fuck.
I'm joking.

15:38.250 --> 15:39.601
Oh, really?
You believed me.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.309
I did, I totally did

15:41.333 --> 15:43.559
believe you as well, yeah, wow.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.976
Whoa, okay, so we're okay, yeah?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.101
We're fine.
We're good to forget.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.476
We missed you and Gillian.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.351
I did a little thing for her.

15:52.375 --> 15:53.500
Did you?

15:55.041 --> 15:57.976
It's too keen, isn't it?
No, it's just kind of, you know.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.601
It's fine.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.017
She's hard nut to crack,
isn't she?

16:02.041 --> 16:06.392
No, not that, you came into
a slightly tense environment.

16:06.416 --> 16:08.726
I know you're a bit worried
about it, but Gillian

16:08.750 --> 16:11.934
we were talking about you,
you fantastically run the stage.

16:11.958 --> 16:14.684
Yeah, you were in a bunch
of professional actors

16:14.708 --> 16:16.892
and you just kind of,

16:16.916 --> 16:20.559
entered and naturally have a
feel for the language. Stop it.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.142
Yeah, it's just that
Gillian has even mentioned

16:22.166 --> 16:24.059
about you maybe kind of

16:24.083 --> 16:26.309
on a poster
or something if we could...

16:26.333 --> 16:27.976
Okay, you're taking
the Mick now.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.184
I wish I was,
but I'm not. That was all her.

16:30.208 --> 16:31.809
Because I've always thought about it.
It was all her.

16:31.833 --> 16:32.976
We were talking about it.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.226
From women's eyes

16:34.250 --> 16:37.101
this doctrine I derive

16:37.125 --> 16:42.226
to sparkle still the
right Promethean fire.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.934
Hark, what is that I hear?

16:44.958 --> 16:47.101
Gillian's men are slaying?

16:47.125 --> 16:49.726
I must go
in the middle of the night

16:49.750 --> 16:52.226
and seek for all of us comfort.

16:52.250 --> 16:56.017
Look, I'm really sorry,
but I've got to go.

16:56.041 --> 16:58.142
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, I'm not
going to always do this to you,

16:58.166 --> 17:00.476
but I've got to get
to the pavilion.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.767
I'll walk with you. Are you sure?
I don't want to force you to go.

17:02.791 --> 17:04.726
No, no. I was going that way.
Yeah?

17:04.750 --> 17:07.059
Yeah, yeah. It is so nice to see you.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.226
Hello, you've got
through to Oliver's phone,

17:09.250 --> 17:12.083
please leave a message
after the tone.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.059
Hi, Ollie, it's Gillian.

17:16.083 --> 17:21.083
I got here in one piece, and...

17:22.165 --> 17:26.892
Listen, I'm sorry for the way
everything just went down.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.059
I was just too nervous
about this morning

17:29.083 --> 17:31.208
and I should have been
more communicative.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.559
I wish I could get you
on the phone.

17:33.583 --> 17:37.601
I was thinking about the show,

17:37.625 --> 17:42.976
and I thought maybe what if we just
changed the venue or like push it back?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.309
I mean these kinds
of things happen.

17:45.333 --> 17:48.392
I mean, this is not the end,
the be-all end-all.

17:48.416 --> 17:52.517
And, anyway, let me know
what you think

17:52.541 --> 17:59.458
and I love you and call
me later. Okay, bye.

18:08.583 --> 18:13.059
Can I show you something? It
started growing. You have as well.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.559
I have.

18:14.583 --> 18:17.809
It does...
Did you just sniff your armpit?

18:17.833 --> 18:20.809
Did you just Your own armpit?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.416
Don't you find it sort of sexy?

18:38.958 --> 18:41.184
No, you don't have to do that.

18:41.208 --> 18:42.601
Why? What?

18:42.625 --> 18:44.142
It's alright, you don't have to.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.125
Come back up here.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.166
Sorry, it doesn't work for me.

18:49.416 --> 18:52.767
Okay. Yeah.
Alright, I don't... it's not you.

18:52.791 --> 18:55.351
I just don't, you know I don't...
Anyone, not with anyone.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.500
I just don't...
I'm not... I just don't.

19:08.708 --> 19:11.809
No, don't come in. Don't come in.
You are not coming in.

19:11.833 --> 19:14.184
The whole thing's fucked up.
Yeah, but it's going to be alright.

19:14.208 --> 19:16.184
No. We've got four days, so that's
going to be plenty of time.

19:16.208 --> 19:17.684
It's not going to be
alright for weeks.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.142
Can I have a look?

19:19.166 --> 19:21.142
You don't want to see.
Look, look.

19:21.166 --> 19:23.351
I do want...
Just cancel it. You're gonna have to do

19:23.375 --> 19:26.809
your Shakespeare somewhere else.
It's off, it's not my problem.

19:26.833 --> 19:30.809
This just seems like such a shame really,
because you put so much work into this.

19:30.833 --> 19:34.809
That's one of the things you
do have, you have a great show,

19:34.833 --> 19:38.392
you have a

19:38.416 --> 19:42.142
talented director,
you have people who are coming.

19:42.166 --> 19:45.392
What you're missing is a venue.
Yeah, we haven't got that anymore, have we?

19:45.416 --> 19:48.101
That's what we've not got, is that.
Why don't I call my dad and see

19:48.125 --> 19:52.726
if we can get like some
sort of temporary structure or

19:52.750 --> 19:54.267
some sort of, I don't know,

19:54.291 --> 19:56.416
uhm, marquee or something.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.375
A marquee would work,
couldn't it?

20:03.791 --> 20:06.767
This is it.
Oh, my god.

20:06.791 --> 20:09.559
My woman cave.
Wow!

20:09.583 --> 20:11.976
Incredible, isn't it.
God, it's amazing.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.892
It's amazing. It gives me
vertigo just looking at it.

20:15.916 --> 20:17.892
I mean, we can have about
five minutes here.

20:17.916 --> 20:21.351
Thanks, yeah, I'd love that.
Oh, my god.

20:21.375 --> 20:25.851
I know, it's amazing. Oh,
my god, the sound is so good.

20:25.875 --> 20:27.517
I know.

20:30.416 --> 20:33.476
You'd have
to be a trained singer

20:33.500 --> 20:35.476
to make that sound good, but.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.684
Hoo!
It's fun, isn't it?

20:42.916 --> 20:47.017
No, but just hold on.
Yeah.

20:47.041 --> 20:50.142
Yeah.
Yeehaw!

20:52.750 --> 20:55.601
Don't touch that.
No, I wasn't actually.

20:55.625 --> 21:00.726
It's sort of greaseproof. If you're
worried about how far back it goes

21:00.750 --> 21:04.184
it goes back a fuck up a long way.
Right, yeah.

21:04.208 --> 21:07.517
Their apartment, I think is going to be
on this side and then to the left of it

21:07.541 --> 21:10.017
is going to be, you know,
everything else happened outside

21:10.041 --> 21:12.726
the apartment, but you'll
always see the apartment.

21:12.750 --> 21:16.184
And then I was thinking, when
they're watching that play

21:16.208 --> 21:18.226
you know, I think it's going to
be something a bit like Hamilton.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.809
They're sitting on their chairs,
they're sitting side by side,

21:20.833 --> 21:24.809
the audience is the
audience, who do you fancy?

21:24.833 --> 21:28.642
Then it's really small, like... which is
nice in contrast to how big the room is.

21:28.666 --> 21:31.392
Then he's like "not going to answer
that, that's a trick question."

21:31.416 --> 21:33.851
And then she's like, "just tell me
who you fancy I don't think you want

21:33.875 --> 21:39.934
to fuck them or anything but who do you
fancy?" Oscar, I read your letter.

21:39.958 --> 21:43.976
I don't do it good because I'm not an actor
but... I don't want to go through it.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.767
He's like, "shut the fuck up, Rachel"
you know, because he loves her.

21:47.791 --> 21:51.726
I love saying fuck in this room in
particular because it feels like

21:51.750 --> 21:56.809
such a... with this, the acoustics
in here I think will be really...

21:56.833 --> 22:00.684
If you can get fucking to it,
then that will sell tickets.

22:00.708 --> 22:03.017
As many fucks on the page as you can.
Yeah.

22:03.041 --> 22:06.101
A couple of cunts, that bums on seats.
I can do that. Yeah.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.684
Because you're a female writer
yeah.

22:07.708 --> 22:09.684
So people, they don't
want to come in

22:09.708 --> 22:11.976
and watch something about
a '50s housewife, you know?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.184
No. They want to come in and
they want to see some fucking

22:14.208 --> 22:17.434
some rimming, and some like,
fisting, and whatever you've got.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.726
I want to eat your body,
I want to eat you.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.726
Like you know when
you love someone so much

22:21.750 --> 22:25.184
that you just
want to consume them?

22:25.208 --> 22:27.351
You wish you could put
that person inside you.

22:27.375 --> 22:28.750
Do you want to go to lunch?

22:30.375 --> 22:32.208
Yeah.
Are you hungry?

22:33.375 --> 22:38.184
Oh, so, okay. Yeah, I am starving actually.
I would love, yeah.

22:38.208 --> 22:40.226
I'm buying.
Thank you.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.666
Oh, it's Gerald.
Right, right, right.

22:57.375 --> 23:00.101
Hi Gerald, it's Rachel.

23:00.125 --> 23:03.583
Thanks for calling me back.
Rachel, dick's daughter.

23:04.625 --> 23:09.267
Dick. Dick.
Yes, his daughter.

23:09.291 --> 23:12.351
Hi, some friends of mine,
lovely people,

23:12.375 --> 23:14.559
they've put together
this Shakespeare festival.

23:14.583 --> 23:18.434
They're really into plays
and actors and things.

23:18.458 --> 23:21.434
And unfortunately, the pavilion
that they were going to host it at

23:21.458 --> 23:22.958
has fallen through.

23:27.625 --> 23:31.000
Yeah, no, I didn't
think that would...

23:33.458 --> 23:36.184
Amazing!
Thank you!

23:36.208 --> 23:38.291
Thank you, Gerald,
that's so kind.

23:39.291 --> 23:40.291
Yeah, I'm on Facebook.

23:42.833 --> 23:45.142
Okay, bye now.

23:45.166 --> 23:50.392
Yeah, bye, will do.
Yeah, bye. Done.

23:50.416 --> 23:53.434
Just done?
Done? We've got a marquee?

23:53.458 --> 23:56.434
We have a marquee.
We've got a marquee! We've got a marquee!

23:56.458 --> 23:57.642
We've got a marquee!

24:06.958 --> 24:07.875
We've got a marquee!

24:09.208 --> 24:10.684
We've got a marquee!
Are you serious?

24:10.708 --> 24:13.309
I mean I...
I made one call.

24:13.333 --> 24:16.226
Congratulations.
To the marquee.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.517
To the marquee.
To the marquee.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.142
Yeah.
We've got a marquee.

24:20.166 --> 24:22.017
You've got a marquee.
Don't move.

24:22.041 --> 24:24.017
I've got half a marquee
with you.

24:24.041 --> 24:25.708
I've got half a marquee
with you, mate.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.142
God, it's so slow,
I can't believe it.

24:45.166 --> 24:47.083
Okay.
Downing one.

24:53.125 --> 24:57.434
Oooh, I just find that
wakes me up for some reason.

24:57.458 --> 24:59.309
I know. No, it burns
really good right here.

24:59.333 --> 25:02.059
Here I'm kind of a big fish
in a small pond,

25:02.083 --> 25:04.601
but I like being a big fish.
Yeah, who doesn't?

25:04.625 --> 25:06.642
Who would want to be
a small fish?

25:06.666 --> 25:09.059
Do you know what I mean? I'm sort of a big
fish in a small pond too in the sense

25:09.083 --> 25:11.059
that amongst my friends

25:11.083 --> 25:14.226
I'm like the loudest,
funniest one.

25:14.250 --> 25:18.101
Yeah, that's so funny,
we have so much in common.

25:18.125 --> 25:22.517
Yeah. I've had several really
terrible experiences with men

25:22.541 --> 25:24.351
and that's what I liked
about your play.

25:24.375 --> 25:30.625
You just captured the complete
pointlessness of men.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.958
Right.
I see you as a bright light.

25:36.083 --> 25:39.476
And I mean, you know, there's a point
in your life where you have to say

25:39.500 --> 25:45.059
"I'm great, I'm fantastic.
I am the light. I am the light."

25:45.083 --> 25:47.059
I say it to myself all the time.

25:47.083 --> 25:48.833
"I'm a fantastic woman."

25:50.083 --> 25:52.142
I look in the mirror
and I think:

25:52.166 --> 25:55.517
"Yeah, you don't need anyone."
Yeah.

25:55.541 --> 25:59.976
And who needs a relationship
when they keep fucking you up?

26:00.000 --> 26:04.017
Do you know what I just feel
like you're all the way over there

26:04.041 --> 26:09.083
yeah. And I'm sort of shouting
and there's a space here.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.309
The thing is, I should have
sat there in the beginning

26:13.333 --> 26:15.684
but I really have to go now

26:15.708 --> 26:19.184
why? Because I feel like I've
had one too many already

26:19.208 --> 26:22.101
and I should get going.
You know it's just...

26:22.125 --> 26:25.708
That's a shame, I just feel like we've
got much more to talk about the play.

26:27.375 --> 26:28.892
Yeah.
Do you know what I mean?

26:28.916 --> 26:31.017
Absolutely.
I agree actually,

26:31.041 --> 26:33.351
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.833
I mean what are
your priorities, right?

26:36.916 --> 26:41.726
Are you asking me?
Yeah, I want to get into the core of you.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.142
You've got so much going
for you, you're photogenic.

26:44.166 --> 26:46.101
I don't want to be
like, sleazy about that

26:46.125 --> 26:49.142
but the thing is that sells.
You can do a lot of press.

26:49.166 --> 26:51.726
Oh my god.
So we're going to put you on the poster.

26:51.750 --> 26:54.809
What do you mean I'm going on a poster?
Of course you are.

26:54.833 --> 26:58.892
Shut up. I mean, I would actually like to
keep my face out of it as much possible.

26:58.916 --> 26:59.851
No.
No?

26:59.875 --> 27:00.892
No.
Okay.

27:00.916 --> 27:03.017
No. I got to put a... no.

27:03.041 --> 27:06.642
Why?
You are the play.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.809
I'm the play?
You are the play.

27:08.833 --> 27:12.434
Well, I just sort of thought
the play was the play.

27:12.458 --> 27:17.541
I just think a couple more
of this and the play is on.

27:18.833 --> 27:24.166
Wait, what do you mean
the play is on? Clarify.

27:26.625 --> 27:30.059
Oh, my god, yeah,
the play is on.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.684
Let's get a pen and paper.

27:31.708 --> 27:34.601
No, let's fucking
carve it in my arms.

27:34.625 --> 27:38.517
Let's get another drink.
I would love another one, thank you.

27:38.541 --> 27:40.892
The same again or two?
Okay.

27:40.916 --> 27:42.934
Two and a shot?
Okay, okay, okay.

27:42.958 --> 27:46.267
Absolutely fine, let's drink up.
Yeah, okay.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.666
Thank you.

28:34.208 --> 28:36.267
She left me for another woman.

28:36.291 --> 28:39.351
I'm a laughing stock.
She doesn't get you.

28:39.375 --> 28:41.767
She doesn't get you.
She doesn't get essence of me.

28:41.791 --> 28:44.101
Even my kids think I'm an idiot.

28:44.125 --> 28:46.017
Who cares about it?
Who cares, really?

28:46.041 --> 28:48.833
But I still love her.
I love her so much.

28:50.125 --> 28:52.291
Oh, my god.

28:53.541 --> 28:56.101
Look at this hair.

29:04.458 --> 29:06.976
Hello!
Oliver!

29:07.000 --> 29:08.642
Yeah. Hello,
you alright?

29:08.666 --> 29:12.184
Yeah, I'm good.
What are you doing?

29:12.208 --> 29:16.101
Wait a minute, it's quite
loud here, wait a minute.

29:16.125 --> 29:17.416
Yeah, are you alright?

29:19.333 --> 29:21.767
Yeah, it's all good,
just having a couple of people.

29:21.791 --> 29:24.434
Nothing, just listening to
stuff. Are you alright?

29:24.458 --> 29:28.184
That sounds fun. That sounds
so... I'm still in Cardiff.

29:28.208 --> 29:30.767
It went so well.
Okay.

29:30.791 --> 29:32.726
So well!
Good, good.

29:32.750 --> 29:37.142
Ollie, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.

29:37.166 --> 29:39.851
I said my play is
going to get produced.

29:39.875 --> 29:43.166
That's great stuff, that's good,
so when are you coming home?

29:44.041 --> 29:47.642
Well, here's the thing I've had
a couple of drinks, not many.

29:47.666 --> 29:52.017
Not like a... just like one or
two, but I don't want to drive

29:52.041 --> 29:53.559
because I think that
would be irresponsible.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.916
I thought you were at a meeting.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.226
I thought you had a meeting.

29:58.250 --> 30:00.226
You're right, I know. I was,

30:00.250 --> 30:04.517
but we had a drink to
celebrate. Because you know...

30:04.541 --> 30:05.934
Are you going to get back then?

30:05.958 --> 30:08.767
Do you want me to come home?

30:08.791 --> 30:11.767
Yeah, of course, I do. You just...
Do you?

30:11.791 --> 30:14.351
Yeah, course I do. Of course, I want
you to come back. I want to come home.

30:14.375 --> 30:15.892
Well, yeah.
Where else are you going to go

30:15.916 --> 30:17.351
if you don't come home?

30:17.375 --> 30:19.267
Alright.
I love you.

30:19.291 --> 30:20.892
Yeah!
Yeah!

30:20.916 --> 30:23.684
Okay.
It's good here. It's good, yeah.

30:23.708 --> 30:25.809
Okay.
Alright, then.

30:25.833 --> 30:28.017
I was hoping...
Just get in a taxi, I'll see you in a bit.

30:28.041 --> 30:30.059
Yeah, I'll jump in a cab.
I'll see you

30:30.083 --> 30:31.333
when you get back here, yeah?

30:32.375 --> 30:34.416
Can I...
Hey, Ollie, Ollie, Ollie.

30:36.416 --> 30:37.500
Great.

30:41.458 --> 30:46.125
Wow, we're going there, aren't we?
Cheers.

30:51.541 --> 30:53.708
Do you want to come to my place?
Yes.

30:55.375 --> 30:56.809
Yeah.

31:05.666 --> 31:09.809
When I meet Gill,
I mean the girl that he meets

31:09.833 --> 31:12.726
sort of this nice, normal girl.

31:12.750 --> 31:14.976
You look amazing in that.

31:15.000 --> 31:15.958
In this?

31:22.166 --> 31:23.833
Slowly kiss me.

31:47.750 --> 31:49.934
Kiss me.
Just kiss you?

31:49.958 --> 31:54.017
You're not scared, are you?
No, I'm just... I'm not.

32:12.625 --> 32:15.934
Oh, my god.
What?

32:15.958 --> 32:17.392
Some more kissing, is it?

32:57.750 --> 32:59.583
Ah, fucking hell.

33:03.041 --> 33:05.351
Oh, my god, babe,
where have you been?

33:05.375 --> 33:07.750
Are you alright?
Mm-hmm.

33:11.625 --> 33:15.642
Where have you been?
I've been out.

33:15.666 --> 33:18.601
I've been out.
Out? That's what I'm going to get? Out?

33:19.875 --> 33:21.517
Come on, how did you not...

33:21.541 --> 33:24.809
I love you. Just come here,
just shut up.

33:24.833 --> 33:26.541
Just shut up,
and come and cuddle.

33:34.833 --> 33:37.500
Oliver.
Yeah.

33:40.291 --> 33:42.416
Do you promise
you'll never leave me?

33:50.500 --> 33:51.708
You alright, babe?

33:54.375 --> 33:58.726
Hey.
Yeah, I'm good. I feel good.

33:58.750 --> 33:59.851
Yeah?
Yeah.

33:59.875 --> 34:02.017
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

34:27.625 --> 34:29.708
30 seconds. 28.

34:32.916 --> 34:35.059
I think it's a really
good thing that it's done.

34:35.083 --> 34:37.476
What?
That we've had this little kind of,

34:37.500 --> 34:39.059
I don't know, little blip.

34:39.083 --> 34:40.891
If we can get through that...

34:43.166 --> 34:47.934
If I can get through that as well
as everything else, we'll be fine.

34:47.958 --> 34:50.059
I would hope so.
You can't hope it,

34:50.083 --> 34:53.766
you've got to be more positive
than that, we will do it.

34:53.791 --> 34:58.976
I do want to say sorry, I don't
want to just brush it off like that.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.642
I am sorry that
I came last night.

35:02.666 --> 35:05.059
Came back this morning actually.

35:05.083 --> 35:08.976
Just forget about it now I guess, yeah?
Just move on from it.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.684
Yeah.

35:10.708 --> 35:14.601
It's a blip and now it's done,
so that's good.

35:14.625 --> 35:17.809
It makes us stronger, actually.

35:17.833 --> 35:19.642
Yeah.
Yeah?

35:19.666 --> 35:24.351
Maybe when we get through
enough off these.

35:24.375 --> 35:26.476
Hopefully, this is the one.
No more of these.

35:26.500 --> 35:30.559
Yeah, well no...
I don't fancy any more of those.

35:30.583 --> 35:34.708
Maybe we'll have a baby?
Yeah.

35:35.666 --> 35:37.476
Yeah!
Yeah.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.434
Yeah.
Yeah!

35:39.458 --> 35:45.101
Yeah, but you have to have
sex with me to have a baby.

35:45.125 --> 35:47.916
Yeah, I know that. We have
sex, we're normally like...

35:49.375 --> 35:52.017
Oh, uhm.
We have some.

35:52.041 --> 35:54.351
We do it a lot at home.

35:54.375 --> 35:57.083
We don't.
We've done it in the kitchen.

35:58.916 --> 36:04.017
We did. We didn't even take our
shoes off and we came in here

36:04.041 --> 36:06.434
and then I did you over
the kitchen thing, didn't I?

36:06.458 --> 36:10.101
I mean, you were having it and
we were on that table. Stop it!

36:10.125 --> 36:13.892
Oh, please, I don't like the way you talk
about me. What are you talking about?

36:13.916 --> 36:18.476
Did you not come fucking...
Like I'm a project. Stop!

36:18.500 --> 36:21.767
I think you were thinking about the moves
then, because we did the moves the first time

36:21.791 --> 36:24.351
and then you wanted the moves again
if I remember. Stop with the moves!

36:24.375 --> 36:26.892
Okay, the...
The fact that you can go

36:26.916 --> 36:29.559
"remember this time, remember
this time, remember this time",

36:29.583 --> 36:32.267
well, it should just
be all one big blur.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.976
You remember the time because
isn't it every day, baby?

36:35.000 --> 36:38.851
I can't do it every... come on you've got to
have a bit of sense now as well, every day?

36:38.875 --> 36:41.434
Cool head, that's just
being daft as well.

36:41.458 --> 36:44.750
Nobody does it every day, you only need
to do it once to have a baby, anyway.

36:55.375 --> 37:00.017
Do we have any garlic? No, I didn't...
sorry I didn't know we needed any.

37:00.041 --> 37:03.309
It'll be a garlic-less
pasta sauce.

37:03.333 --> 37:04.458
Alright.

37:11.166 --> 37:13.434
Garlic won't make a difference anyway
really. It won't, you know what?

37:13.458 --> 37:15.583
It'll be fine.
It...

37:16.708 --> 37:22.059
Fuck it, it will. Let's not
pretend, right? Already.

37:22.083 --> 37:23.250
I like it anyway.

37:35.458 --> 37:36.500
How is that?

37:38.250 --> 37:39.684
It's alright.
It's alright, yeah.

37:39.708 --> 37:40.976
It's alright.
It's a bit sweet.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.541
It's not the best, not.

37:43.791 --> 37:46.226
No, it was good.
It was a good night.

37:46.250 --> 37:51.142
I'm glad that I went, I'm glad that I
stayed late, not that late obviously

37:51.166 --> 37:55.392
I could have done without that,
but it was good for

37:55.416 --> 37:57.500
the job, it was good
for the relationship, you know.

37:58.416 --> 38:01.434
You want to stay
in their consciousness

38:01.458 --> 38:04.226
you want them to be thinking about you the
next day like "yeah, I love that girl."

38:04.250 --> 38:07.267
She was liking your play.
Liking your play.

38:07.291 --> 38:09.267
She loves my... of course
she loves my play. Good.

38:09.291 --> 38:12.101
That is what's so validating
is just to have someone,

38:12.125 --> 38:15.976
you know, who's not my family member,
not someone who loves me, think that

38:16.000 --> 38:19.726
what I'm making
is brilliant, you know.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.559
It's funny because
she is so fucking smart.

38:22.583 --> 38:24.767
She's so on it, especially
with this kind of stuff.

38:24.791 --> 38:27.892
We really, like, we really
understand, she likes the same plays

38:27.916 --> 38:29.309
and it was just like
boom, boom, boom, boom.

38:29.333 --> 38:31.642
And do you know it's good.

38:31.666 --> 38:35.892
That... this was wild,
but like, I kissed her.

38:35.916 --> 38:38.809
I mean she kissed me, but, yeah.

38:38.833 --> 38:39.809
We kissed.

38:39.833 --> 38:42.142
Like what?

38:42.166 --> 38:48.559
I just... that is so...
It's so not me.

38:48.583 --> 38:49.916
I kissed a girl.

38:51.416 --> 38:55.434
I Li... like snogged.

38:55.458 --> 39:01.059
Like properly like: "Oh, my god, what
am I doing? I must be so drunk."

39:01.083 --> 39:04.059
Wow! Is it just in your 30's
that you start being like:

39:04.083 --> 39:06.392
"Whatever, I'm just going
to kiss some girl now."

39:06.416 --> 39:07.541
I totally kissed her.

39:08.541 --> 39:09.583
Just...

39:11.458 --> 39:13.083
I guess I should have done it in high
school and got that out my system.

39:14.625 --> 39:16.500
I'm kind of...

39:17.458 --> 39:18.934
So did I.

39:18.958 --> 39:22.184
Shut up!
What are you... don't even.

39:22.208 --> 39:24.791
You got...
I got kissed by someone as well.

39:34.416 --> 39:38.000
What? That's not the same,
is it though?

39:39.291 --> 39:40.958
No, it's not exactly the same,
but it's...

39:42.625 --> 39:46.559
Similar. It's not. I don't
think it's the same at all.

39:46.583 --> 39:49.934
Other people can kiss girls
as well, not just you, maybe.

39:49.958 --> 39:53.101
Of course they can... of course
other people can kiss girls.

39:53.125 --> 39:55.476
Maybe other girls
want to kiss me.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.934
Maybe somebody
kissed me last night.

39:56.958 --> 39:59.059
I'm sure other people
want to kiss you

39:59.083 --> 40:01.059
I want to kiss you
all the fucking time.

40:01.083 --> 40:02.476
I know somebody else
wanted to kiss me

40:02.500 --> 40:03.750
because I kissed someone
else last night.

40:12.125 --> 40:13.541
A bit of fun.

40:20.458 --> 40:21.625
Uhm...

40:23.791 --> 40:27.500
Wow, who did you kiss?

40:31.416 --> 40:33.392
I don't want to know. I don't
want to know who you kissed.

40:33.416 --> 40:35.934
You do know.
I don't want to know who you kissed.

40:35.958 --> 40:38.934
Okay.
Actually, just don't even fucking tell me.

40:38.958 --> 40:42.434
I won't then. I won't.
Don't fucking... do not even try.

40:42.458 --> 40:44.958
Whatever you did is not
the same as what I did.

40:47.458 --> 40:49.375
No, I wasn't up all night.

40:51.166 --> 40:52.166
Uhm...

41:04.708 --> 41:06.291
Yeah?
Yeah.

41:09.416 --> 41:13.166
Yeah, just...

41:17.125 --> 41:20.184
Oh, shit!
I forgot the spaghetti.

41:20.208 --> 41:25.559
Do you know what? I cannot believe
what is going on? It's a bit dry.

41:25.583 --> 41:29.059
That was always gonna happen
with that heat on it.

41:29.083 --> 41:32.476
I knew it! I knew Rachel liked you.
I knew she liked you.

41:32.500 --> 41:36.267
Yeah, but it was not...
I knew it. I knew she had a crush on you.

41:36.291 --> 41:37.226
I called it.

41:37.250 --> 41:38.208
It was...

42:02.916 --> 42:03.916
Hi, guys!

42:05.000 --> 42:06.291
Guys!

42:07.583 --> 42:08.458
Hiya.

42:10.500 --> 42:14.392
Hi! Wow!
Oh, my god!

42:14.416 --> 42:15.851
It's good, isn't it? Yeah.

42:15.875 --> 42:17.017
Thank you.

42:17.041 --> 42:20.000
Yeah, wow!
Yeah.

42:20.625 --> 42:23.392
Don't let us stop you. If we're in the
middle of it, don't let it stop you, though.

42:23.416 --> 42:25.976
Because we got to...
I'll leave you to it.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.017
Okay.
Yeah.

42:28.041 --> 42:30.517
Bye, guys.
Okay, bye-bye now, ta-ta.

42:30.541 --> 42:34.017
Ta-ta.
Bye! Bye!

42:34.041 --> 42:37.559
Thank you for both turning up. We've
got a problem with the actors.

42:37.583 --> 42:39.767
What's wrong?
The actors are saying that they don't think

42:39.791 --> 42:41.767
you were really into this.
That's not the point.

42:41.791 --> 42:44.476
It doesn't matter what I want
and don't want, we're here

42:44.500 --> 42:48.517
to do a job, aren't we, Jeff? Am I not there
and present every fucking day, am I not?

42:48.541 --> 42:51.267
I'm sorry, what more do you want? Do you
want me to love it? Let's do your play.

42:51.291 --> 42:53.309
Just telling you what
the actors have said.

42:53.333 --> 42:56.184
Let's do your play.
What do you mean let's do my play?

42:56.208 --> 42:58.642
What about your mom?
Forget about my mother.

42:58.666 --> 43:01.434
My mother will just sit there
and be happy with anything.

43:01.458 --> 43:03.934
No, she won't be happy.
There's a tent and there'll be a play

43:03.958 --> 43:07.125
and my mother will be happy.
If we do yours, I'll be happy.

43:08.708 --> 43:12.809
It's ready, let's just do it.
Come on, guys.

43:12.833 --> 43:14.934
Let me ask them. Let me just show them
Jeff's right, let's do it.

43:14.958 --> 43:16.976
I want to hear their thoughts.
Let's go and ask them and see.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.767
I want to see who would...

43:18.791 --> 43:20.500
Just give me a second.

43:22.875 --> 43:26.500
Are you guys okay?
Yeah, we're fine.

43:37.208 --> 43:38.934
I used to come down
here with your mother.

43:38.958 --> 43:41.309
Yeah?
Yeah, we were courting.

43:43.541 --> 43:45.208
All those years ago.
Yeah.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.541
Things aren't going the best, really.
What, with you and Gillian?

43:54.291 --> 43:55.583
Yeah.
Why?

43:58.416 --> 44:00.809
I've done some things wrong.

44:00.833 --> 44:03.833
What did you... come on.

44:05.875 --> 44:08.708
I kissed Rachel.

44:11.875 --> 44:14.392
It was just...
Just kissed her?

44:14.416 --> 44:17.767
Just kissed her.
She kissed me back.

44:17.791 --> 44:21.642
There's nothing wrong kissing
somebody else, you know, I mean.

44:21.666 --> 44:24.809
Isn't there?
No, Christ no. She's a lovely girl.

44:24.833 --> 44:29.934
She is, yeah.
And I... even an old twat like me

44:29.958 --> 44:33.291
I can realize that she's a very,
very, very attractive girl.

44:34.333 --> 44:38.309
Alright.
I wouldn't blame you for a minute.

44:38.333 --> 44:41.101
It's a bit more complicated.
What?

44:41.125 --> 44:43.892
It's a bit more complicated.
What, do you mean you...

44:43.916 --> 44:48.767
No, not me
doing anything, but Gillian,

44:48.791 --> 44:50.892
she kissed a lady as well,
though. I kissed a woman

44:50.916 --> 44:52.684
and she kissed a woman.
What?

44:52.708 --> 44:54.226
Yeah.

44:54.250 --> 44:57.458
Gillian?
Yeah.

44:59.791 --> 45:01.642
Oh, god.

45:01.666 --> 45:05.666
I thought that that was
a bloody, you know... but...

45:07.958 --> 45:11.142
One of them women.
Yeah.

45:11.166 --> 45:14.601
Lesbian, dad, you can say it, it's alright.
Alright, a fucking lesbian.

45:14.625 --> 45:17.767
Yeah, you can still say lesbian
without the fucking,

45:17.791 --> 45:20.642
it's alright.
I don't think she is one.

45:20.666 --> 45:24.684
No, I don't think she is either.
Christ, it's just one of those...

45:24.708 --> 45:28.517
You know, one of those...

45:28.541 --> 45:30.517
She did say she was drunk.

45:30.541 --> 45:31.934
There you go then.
There you are.

45:31.958 --> 45:34.601
I mean that's it, isn't it?

45:34.625 --> 45:37.267
It's as simple as that.
You know.

45:37.291 --> 45:41.059
I just love her, dad. I cant...
I know that.

45:41.083 --> 45:45.684
She's a good kid. She's stuck
by you like give, really.

45:45.708 --> 45:48.267
She deserves a medal, actually
for putting up with you.

45:48.291 --> 45:50.351
No, she does.

45:50.375 --> 45:52.809
She does.
Great pep talk, dad.

45:52.833 --> 45:55.892
She deserves a medal
for putting up with me.

45:55.916 --> 45:58.892
It's the beer talking.
The fuck it is.

45:58.916 --> 46:00.392
She has stuck around, though,
hasn't she?

46:00.416 --> 46:04.101
Yeah. I mean, maybe if
you had a job,

46:04.125 --> 46:08.184
a proper, proper job.
Well, I've got a job.

46:08.208 --> 46:10.184
Deejaying is
a proper job, is it?

46:10.208 --> 46:12.142
Well, yeah.

46:12.166 --> 46:16.059
How much do you make on that?
150 quid a week?

46:16.083 --> 46:19.434
A night... 150 quid a night.
A night, how many nights a week?

46:19.458 --> 46:22.309
One night a week.
One night a week, 150 quid a week?

46:22.333 --> 46:25.517
Alright. 150 quid a week,
that's what it's about?

46:25.541 --> 46:27.351
Yeah. Yeah.

46:27.375 --> 46:30.142
What I suggest you do now,
is you go out, right?

46:30.166 --> 46:32.934
Go all the home,
don't stop, okay?

46:32.958 --> 46:37.059
Yeah. You pick up a meal,
takeaway, an Indian or Chinese.

46:37.083 --> 46:38.476
She likes Chinese, doesn't she?
Yeah.

46:38.500 --> 46:39.934
Chinese, okay.
Yeah.

46:39.958 --> 46:43.476
Flowers, right?
Yeah, the full shebang.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.392
Women love that.
Yeah?

46:45.416 --> 46:50.267
They do. You need to
sort it out. Just sort it out.

46:50.291 --> 46:51.458
Right.

47:00.625 --> 47:02.583
Just like... I'm young.

47:05.500 --> 47:09.726
Just because you kissed a girl, doesn't
mean you don't love your husband.

47:16.333 --> 47:22.226
I love my husband, that doesn't mean I
don't like to have sex as well with girls.

47:22.250 --> 47:26.017
I think that's what people do
as a rite of passage, isn't it?

47:31.500 --> 47:33.851
He loves girls too,
he loves a girl named Rachel.

47:33.875 --> 47:35.000
That's amazing.

47:36.833 --> 47:39.559
We're not...
We're not the conventional sort.

47:52.166 --> 47:57.226
Matt, wow, hi.
Gillian, been looking for you.

47:57.250 --> 48:01.309
What are you doing here?
Ollie's not here.

48:01.333 --> 48:04.434
I'm not here for Ollie,
I'm here for you.

48:04.458 --> 48:07.392
You got me flowers.
Can you just listen.

48:07.416 --> 48:09.184
I just want to talk to you,
if that's alright?

48:09.208 --> 48:10.642
Okay.

48:10.666 --> 48:12.309
You know I went to London
and I went

48:12.333 --> 48:13.892
to get away because

48:13.916 --> 48:16.059
you're with my mate
and that's not right

48:16.083 --> 48:18.351
that I should have the thoughts
that I have, but I have them

48:18.375 --> 48:20.184
and I've decided...
Hold on right there.

48:20.208 --> 48:22.184
Just come in, come in a sec.

48:22.208 --> 48:24.142
I would like that very much.

48:24.166 --> 48:26.517
What are you talking about?
It made me realize something.

48:26.541 --> 48:28.809
The right thing to do,
is to be with you.

48:28.833 --> 48:32.226
Now, I know that maybe you think
"you like, as in you like writing"

48:32.250 --> 48:36.142
and maybe you think I can't be
that sort of guy, but I can be.

48:36.166 --> 48:39.142
I wrote you a poem.
Can I read it to you?

48:39.166 --> 48:41.809
Oh, yeah, please,
I'd love to hear your poem.

48:41.833 --> 48:43.833
I've never written before,
I've done this for you.

48:45.250 --> 48:47.309
It's called Gillian.
Okay.

48:47.333 --> 48:52.976
I think of you night and day and
how you'd be the greatest lay.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.559
I think of us together at last.

48:55.583 --> 48:58.767
I think of banging you
out on the grass

48:58.791 --> 49:04.458
to kiss your neck would be my task,
but in the end, I'd want your ass.

49:05.375 --> 49:09.517
There is no one finer
from here to north Carolina,

49:09.541 --> 49:13.017
and if you don't mind,
I'd like to kiss your vagina.

49:13.041 --> 49:14.976
Oh, my god, yeah.

49:17.625 --> 49:19.375
That was so good.

49:30.416 --> 49:32.934
Hello, babe, you alright?

49:35.583 --> 49:38.000
I feel like I'm deep inside you.

49:39.083 --> 49:41.559
If she's in there with you,
I'm coming in now!

49:41.583 --> 49:44.309
I'm just telling you now,
GILLIAN: Don't be so fucking loud.

49:44.333 --> 49:45.625
I don't know what's going...

49:51.708 --> 49:54.125
You alright, mate?
Alright.

49:55.250 --> 49:57.684
You know it's not been right
between you two

49:57.708 --> 50:00.642
and you know it's always
been right between us.

50:00.666 --> 50:04.351
You need someone your own size,
and she's my fit.

50:04.375 --> 50:07.517
Matt.
In many ways, I've done you a favor.

50:07.541 --> 50:10.892
You need to just stop. Just go.

50:10.916 --> 50:12.684
I'll be waiting.
I don't think?

50:12.708 --> 50:17.625
I know. What are you...
What are you doing?

50:20.958 --> 50:25.476
You fell in love with someone.
Oh, god!

50:25.500 --> 50:28.059
"In love with someone."
Of course I'm not.

50:28.083 --> 50:30.559
I don't believe it for a second.
I think you're just saying that

50:30.583 --> 50:33.101
and I think you've fallen in love
with her, and I think you kissing her

50:33.125 --> 50:36.226
is worse than any fucking dick I
could take in my pussy, right now.

50:36.250 --> 50:38.601
I'm in love with you. What the fuck
do you mean with some connection?

50:38.625 --> 50:40.684
I don't believe you for a second
that you're in love with me.

50:40.708 --> 50:42.726
I can see
you connecting just now.

50:42.750 --> 50:43.934
You've had a woman and man.

50:43.958 --> 50:46.476
I've just have one kiss.

50:46.500 --> 50:48.601
What are we even doing?

50:48.625 --> 50:49.809
I don't know,
I'm not doing anything.

50:49.833 --> 50:51.226
You're the one doing everyone.

50:51.250 --> 50:53.392
That's the thing,
that's the thing.

50:53.416 --> 50:58.375
You think that, is you think you're
not doing anything. Get out.

51:00.541 --> 51:03.892
Come on, grow up.
What do you mean, "get out"?

51:03.916 --> 51:07.726
"Come on, grow up." Why am I
grow... grow up? Get out. Get out!

51:07.750 --> 51:10.726
Get out!
We are not doing well. Get out!

51:10.750 --> 51:13.041
No, no. You get out!

51:14.583 --> 51:18.726
Get out of my mother's house!
How's that?

51:18.750 --> 51:20.601
Oh yeah, it's your mommy's house.
You get out.

51:20.625 --> 51:23.017
Whose house is it?
Stay in mommy's house, then.

51:23.041 --> 51:25.892
Don't bring my mother
into it, now!

51:25.916 --> 51:28.684
You're disgusting kicking a woman
out of her own fucking house.

51:28.708 --> 51:30.684
Oh, fuck off!

52:01.625 --> 52:05.517
I'm going do really... I'm going to
surprise you now. Okay, are you ready?

52:05.541 --> 52:09.392
I'm ready?
Oh, my god, you don't do it.

52:09.416 --> 52:11.476
Left handed.

52:11.500 --> 52:13.333
That's a fit.
I'm gonna be off a new drill.

52:26.916 --> 52:28.791
Are you ready? I'm
going to throw to you, right?

52:31.416 --> 52:32.791
Oh, sorry babe, I didn't mean to...
aww!

52:34.500 --> 52:36.601
That one hurt. All of me, that was
all on me, that was my throw.

52:36.625 --> 52:37.541
Come here, come here.

52:38.416 --> 52:39.833
My fault. More?

52:43.375 --> 52:46.166
Better, yeah?
Yeah.

52:47.750 --> 52:48.708
Thank you.

52:53.291 --> 52:57.309
Oh, yes! Did you see the way
you did that? Straight up, like a boom?

52:57.333 --> 52:59.184
You like when
I go like that? Frisbee.

52:59.208 --> 53:00.476
You look gorgeous.

53:18.041 --> 53:19.333
You're having a think?

53:24.291 --> 53:26.000
Are you having a think?
Yeah.

53:29.375 --> 53:30.458
It's going to take a while?

53:34.833 --> 53:36.017
Can you have a think in the car?

53:36.041 --> 53:37.351
It's just,

53:37.375 --> 53:39.684
I forgot WWE Smackdown

53:39.708 --> 53:42.059
and it's on in 23 minutes.

53:42.083 --> 53:46.142
Hey, Matt.

53:46.166 --> 53:47.083
Yeah.

53:48.750 --> 53:50.625
Do you like the beach?
Yeah, I love it.

53:51.625 --> 53:54.309
You know how
parents take like a shell

53:54.333 --> 53:57.767
and they put it to your ear, and they
GO: "You know, that's the ocean."

53:57.791 --> 54:01.767
Yeah. My dad did that. He
said: "This is the sea."

54:01.791 --> 54:04.517
And then, you listen and
it's like.

54:04.541 --> 54:08.934
It sounds like the sea,
but actually it's not.

54:08.958 --> 54:14.434
What is it? It's just the way
that the shell is structured

54:14.458 --> 54:16.059
and then, you look
like a fucking idiot

54:16.083 --> 54:18.392
when you finally tell someone:

54:18.416 --> 54:21.476
"That's the sea in there." And
they're like: "No, it's not."

54:21.500 --> 54:24.976
And I know he wasn't lying, he
was just trying to make it nice,

54:25.000 --> 54:27.309
but it actually did end up being a
lie because then you believe it

54:27.333 --> 54:29.208
and then, you look like a fucking idiot.
Right.

54:30.583 --> 54:31.833
It's horrible, isn't it?

54:33.625 --> 54:35.892
Yeah, yeah.

54:35.916 --> 54:38.767
I mean, it sounds like it was
quite a long time ago, though,

54:38.791 --> 54:43.916
so, probably best not
to think about it anymore.

54:51.125 --> 54:56.125
Do you ever think
about what love is?

54:57.000 --> 55:00.809
Actual love?
Yeah. What is it? What do people mean?

55:00.833 --> 55:04.559
Because it's this myth, isn't it?
It's just a concept.

55:04.583 --> 55:07.726
No. Love is a thing.
What is it?

55:07.750 --> 55:11.642
It's a chemical reaction in the body.
I look at you, and I love you

55:11.666 --> 55:14.142
and what that means is,
I see you.

55:14.166 --> 55:17.267
The image pass through
my eyes to my brain

55:17.291 --> 55:19.642
down to my heart,
and into my knob

55:19.666 --> 55:23.434
and I get a boner,
and that means I love you,

55:23.458 --> 55:25.267
and you reciprocate it.

55:25.291 --> 55:28.601
You look at me, and you
see me through your eyes

55:28.625 --> 55:31.059
and it goes through your head,
through your heart

55:31.083 --> 55:37.309
and you get wide on. And, if I have a boner
and you have a wide on, that's love.

55:37.333 --> 55:39.392
If I have a boner,
and you don't have a wide on

55:39.416 --> 55:43.726
that's unrequited,
and vice versa.

55:43.750 --> 55:48.184
And when we kiss, that's
soulmates, for that moment.

55:48.208 --> 55:52.059
Yeah. I think you're right.

55:52.083 --> 55:55.309
I am right. I think you are right.
That's it, though. It's just simple.

55:55.333 --> 55:57.684
It's just simple.
It's just...

55:57.708 --> 55:59.976
People have been writing
what they've been writing

56:00.000 --> 56:02.351
creating what they've been creating
the messes they've been making

56:02.375 --> 56:04.851
and the people they've
been murdering for this

56:04.875 --> 56:06.458
all because they're
fucking horny.

56:08.041 --> 56:09.892
Yeah.
You might be right.

56:09.916 --> 56:12.916
I'm completely right.
I've proved it many times.

56:15.541 --> 56:17.267
You love me?

56:17.291 --> 56:19.934
Right now,
I love the shit out of you.

56:19.958 --> 56:21.684
Do you want to love me
in the Van?

56:21.708 --> 56:23.517
I want to love you
till you're dead.

56:23.541 --> 56:26.875
Okay, in the car.
Take me to the Van.

56:28.833 --> 56:31.541
One second, let me adjust this.

56:33.291 --> 56:37.892
You lie down,
I'm just going to climb on.

56:37.916 --> 56:39.892
Fucking hell, hold on.

56:41.958 --> 56:42.875
Okay.

56:53.625 --> 56:57.684
That's so nice.
That is... wait.

56:57.708 --> 57:00.375
Wait, wait let me just
get my leg. It's cramping.

57:05.250 --> 57:10.309
If you just stay still, I can just do it.
If you just stay right...

57:10.333 --> 57:12.559
Just stick your tongue out.

57:12.583 --> 57:13.875
Mmm.

57:16.291 --> 57:18.392
What are you doing?

57:18.416 --> 57:21.601
I'm doing 20 minute intervals,
you know what I mean, so that...

57:21.625 --> 57:23.267
We're to start with this
and we're going to move on

57:23.291 --> 57:26.809
To different... yeah.

57:26.833 --> 57:29.642
I'll let you know.
I have a clue.

57:29.666 --> 57:32.000
I've got the phone
right here, baby.

57:58.583 --> 57:59.458
That is it?

58:01.500 --> 58:04.809
This is the...
So, this is it?

58:04.833 --> 58:07.059
This is the tent?
This is all yours?

58:07.083 --> 58:08.434
It's mine and Oliver's.

58:08.458 --> 58:11.059
The... generally...
Americano?

58:11.083 --> 58:14.684
Hi. Good morning.
You got this for me?

58:14.708 --> 58:17.809
Yeah, I know you like it.
Alright, mate.

58:17.833 --> 58:19.476
Alright, yeah.
Thank you.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.476
I only got one,
I didn't know he was coming.

58:21.500 --> 58:23.291
That's alright, mate.
Coffee is bad for you.

58:25.000 --> 58:29.226
How is this feeling for you now?
Is this all looking right?

58:29.250 --> 58:31.351
Oh, wow. Okay.
Did you do this?

58:31.375 --> 58:33.059
Yeah.
And Tony set it all up.

58:33.083 --> 58:35.059
Did you put up that fabric?

58:35.083 --> 58:37.392
Yeah, I put it over the thing.
That's great. Thank you.

58:37.416 --> 58:40.184
It's small, because
the ratio of the stage

58:40.208 --> 58:42.434
to the tent
is a little bit weak.

58:42.458 --> 58:43.601
It's more than weak, yeah.

58:43.625 --> 58:44.976
You can put stuff up to break up

58:45.000 --> 58:47.142
the white a little bit. Twigs.

58:47.166 --> 58:50.601
I hate the twigs.
I really hate the twigs.

58:50.625 --> 58:53.559
Do whatever you want, I'm not... I'll
give them a try. I will give them a try.

58:53.583 --> 58:56.392
Yeah? Or we'll get something
else, then, maybe?

58:56.416 --> 58:58.541
I think you're right
about the foliage, actually.

59:00.833 --> 59:03.559
Can I...
And you want these?

59:03.583 --> 59:05.208
Yeah, we can put those
wherever you want.

59:06.333 --> 59:09.351
Mate, can I have a word?

59:09.375 --> 59:12.934
Yeah, sorry, I've just got to go and
have a word. Just be a minute, babe.

59:12.958 --> 59:14.476
I'll just be a second, now.

59:14.500 --> 59:15.892
Yeah, be nice.

59:15.916 --> 59:17.976
I re-did the life table.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.684
What?
Scores have changed.

59:19.708 --> 59:20.684
I'm amazed
you're still doing this?

59:20.708 --> 59:21.684
Crisscross,

59:21.708 --> 59:24.017
you, blank. Jeff, spots.

59:24.041 --> 59:28.976
Jeff, standard as usual.
Girlfriends, me way more. Whys?

59:29.000 --> 59:32.767
Yes, you had one, but I fucked her.
One nighters, loads more.

59:32.791 --> 59:36.559
Cool jobs, me,
way more. Holidays...

59:36.583 --> 59:39.392
Cool jobs?
Yeah, mate. I'm a personal trainer.

59:39.416 --> 59:41.267
Are you?
Yes, mate.

59:41.291 --> 59:43.267
Are you actually a personal trainer?
Yes, mate.

59:43.291 --> 59:45.851
Or... I work with women. I
make their butts bigger.

59:45.875 --> 59:50.351
Yeah, I'm a DJ. You are wedding DJ.
It's not quite the same.

59:50.375 --> 59:53.184
What do you want? I've had the
time of my life again? Alright.

59:53.208 --> 59:57.684
I've got a residency. You're like an uncle.
You are a resident uncle.

59:57.708 --> 01:00:00.976
I do birthday parties and
I do any celebration you want

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.392
really, I can go around.
I do all of the stuff.

01:00:03.416 --> 01:00:05.976
Moving on, holidays...
Look, I gave you that.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.642
Okay.
Friends, even.

01:00:07.666 --> 01:00:11.017
Fashion, no competition.
Feasance, no competition,

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:15.684
anal, although, look, there was that one time you
told me about but I'm sure that was a mistake.

01:00:15.708 --> 01:00:19.476
True love.
True love? How have you done that?

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.184
I should be at the top of that. Give me...
You can't just be doing that, "true love"

01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:25.892
just all of a sudden... Jeff's
on the same as me as true love.

01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:30.351
Mate, what did Rihanna say?
"All's fair in love and war."

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:34.726
Look, okay. All is fair and
all that, but come on, now.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:36.601
You've had a bit of
a laugh now, right?

01:00:36.625 --> 01:00:38.267
You've done that now, just...

01:00:38.291 --> 01:00:41.184
I've done that a few times.
What do mates do?

01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:44.184
They step aside
when a mate finds love.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:46.559
Exactly, mate. So...
And they let love bloom.

01:00:46.583 --> 01:00:50.642
Aside, out of your... You two,

01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:53.059
would you mind? I'm just
trying to work over here.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.017
Just keep it down a bit.
Do you need any help moving anything?

01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:57.059
I can move the whole thing
if you need it.

01:00:57.083 --> 01:00:58.184
We don't need
the whole thing moved

01:00:58.208 --> 01:01:00.017
we just need that moving.

01:01:00.041 --> 01:01:02.059
We just...
How much of the stuff did you need moved?

01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:03.184
I can move stuff, as well.

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:04.476
I'm just trying to focus,

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.017
it's hard to focus.

01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:07.267
Alright, sorry.

01:01:07.291 --> 01:01:08.208
It's okay.

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:10.934
That's a bit childish, isn't it?

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:12.892
Bit childish,
doing that like that.

01:01:12.916 --> 01:01:15.958
Is it like that?
Go on.

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:28.833
Get off.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:54.559
What's that?
This needs redoing?

01:01:54.583 --> 01:01:56.000
What're you doing there?

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:02.434
Fighting.
For a draw? It was a draw, mate.

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:12.000
Is there a plug hole in the tent?
Yeah.

01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:15.791
I love the tent.
I really love it.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:19.726
It'll break up the white.
Yeah.

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:22.101
Why have you brought a Frisbee
I thought we were working out.

01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:24.059
Okay, catch it.
Just keep your eye on it,

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:26.726
and then you definitely
will catch it.

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.184
Alright, throw it.

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:30.476
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.976
Matt, what are you doing?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.059
Matt, not right here.

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.767
I just wanted to play Frisbee.

01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:38.351
That's all I wanted.
Get on my back.

01:02:38.375 --> 01:02:40.351
Why?
Because we're doing a workout.

01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:41.601
I wanted to show you something.

01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:42.625
Okay.

01:02:45.333 --> 01:02:47.517
And now what? Well, if you're
not going to do it properly,

01:02:47.541 --> 01:02:49.059
forget it.

01:02:49.083 --> 01:02:50.934
But I'm just doing
what you told me to.

01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:52.684
You're being heavier on purpose.
Is that it?

01:02:52.708 --> 01:02:53.809
Where'd the Frisbee go, then?

01:02:53.833 --> 01:02:54.750
Fuck the Frisbee.

01:02:55.958 --> 01:02:57.559
Why?
Let's go get back.

01:02:57.583 --> 01:02:58.791
We've got to set up
the barbecue.

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:01.601
We hardly played.

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.916
Oliver.
Yeah?

01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:23.476
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.142
It's all going to be fine,
and I'm sorry for...

01:03:26.166 --> 01:03:29.684
Oh, yeah, no, there's nothing
to be sorry about.

01:03:29.708 --> 01:03:31.976
Oh, no, I feel really
awful about it.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.184
Don't feel awful about it.

01:03:33.208 --> 01:03:36.184
I mean, I didn't feel awful...

01:03:36.208 --> 01:03:39.166
Kissing you was nice.

01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:42.851
Just was a happy moment.

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:44.184
It was just a happy moment.

01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:45.583
It was just a happy moment.

01:03:54.583 --> 01:03:56.083
I have to get her back.

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:02.559
What if we go to the barbecue?

01:04:02.583 --> 01:04:04.226
Who's barbecue?

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:07.476
Matt's having a barbecue
at his parent's house.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.351
If we turn up together then,

01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:13.392
go in there fairly strong,
and then you get straight in

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:18.184
in between Matt and Gillian,
and just take him away.

01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:19.351
Oh, I see.
Just get him away,

01:04:19.375 --> 01:04:22.226
because he'll be really into

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:25.351
the way you look, and stuff. If you can
just then keep him out of the way,

01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:30.601
it would just
really let me get...

01:04:30.625 --> 01:04:31.583
I see what you're saying.

01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:34.434
Alright.
Deal?

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:36.083
Deal.
Deal.

01:04:41.583 --> 01:04:43.000
You really want her back,
don't you?

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.791
I don't know
what to do without her.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:50.976
Oi, you're not vegetarian, are you?
What?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.226
You're not vegetarian, are you?

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:54.976
No.
Thank god for that.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.726
It is very picnicky. Heads up.

01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:58.750
Oh, shit.

01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:06.351
In scene two, she already feels

01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:07.976
like their marriage
is falling apart

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.892
And she says: "Who do
you fancy in here?"

01:05:09.916 --> 01:05:11.934
It is a trick question.
If you ask someone

01:05:11.958 --> 01:05:14.767
who you're with, if they fancy...

01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:17.392
Who they fancy, what do
you think they mean?

01:05:17.416 --> 01:05:20.559
They mean...
Hang on, if you ask me "who do I fancy?"

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.892
Yeah.
You.

01:05:22.916 --> 01:05:24.250
Thank you.

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:27.851
I was just on the phone
to one of my actors,

01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:32.059
she's a fucking nightmare.
She's trying to infuse her own

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:34.559
meanings into my writing.

01:05:34.583 --> 01:05:39.142
All I want her to do, is
simply say the line, you know.

01:05:39.166 --> 01:05:43.059
Like I don't actually need her
to do like pregnant pauses.

01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:46.184
Oh, yeah.
But anyway, I just told her that.

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:48.750
Please, just say the lines.

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:52.142
And...
What did she say?

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:56.392
She said: "Sure." But listen

01:05:56.416 --> 01:05:58.892
I just don't have a good
relationship with these actors.

01:05:58.916 --> 01:06:01.351
They hate me,
they think I'm some sort

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:04.184
of controlling bitch,
but I am, because it's my play.

01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:05.767
Yeah, you're the boss.

01:06:05.791 --> 01:06:07.666
I'm just going to
spread this blanket out.

01:06:08.791 --> 01:06:10.000
Okay.

01:06:11.208 --> 01:06:12.726
It's a nice blanket.

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:14.125
Yeah, it's a solid blanket.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.458
Do you want to come
on the blanket with me?

01:06:21.416 --> 01:06:23.083
Well, I mean,
I'm still cooking, so.

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:25.333
Very soft.

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:29.309
Do you want to come
lie down on it with me?

01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:32.333
I can't take my eyes of this, you
overcook these, you ruin it.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.958
But I wanted to celebrate.

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:40.851
What do you mean?

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:43.541
Well, I want to have
a celebratory shag.

01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:47.083
In your mom's garden.

01:06:49.666 --> 01:06:50.809
What are you celebrating?

01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:53.541
My play being produced, finally.

01:06:54.625 --> 01:06:58.250
Yeah, in a tent
for like 40 people.

01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:01.583
It's good.

01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:07.559
It's something.

01:07:07.583 --> 01:07:10.017
Some people never get that,
not even a tent.

01:07:10.041 --> 01:07:13.684
That's true.
Listen, I'd love to shag you,

01:07:13.708 --> 01:07:17.958
but Jeff is coming around,
and my mom could walk in.

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:22.392
What we have is like...
It's more than just sex.

01:07:22.416 --> 01:07:24.642
Not just... you can't just
have sex all the time.

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:27.309
I love sex, I'm all about sex,

01:07:27.333 --> 01:07:29.875
but the fact is,
there is more to life.

01:07:31.666 --> 01:07:33.916
Sometimes I just want
to know about you.

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:36.333
The real you.

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:38.791
Should I have brought some meat?

01:07:39.875 --> 01:07:41.434
No, I don't think so.

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:42.976
I haven't bought anything,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.684
not even sausage.
Don't worry about that,

01:07:45.708 --> 01:07:48.392
guys, I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

01:07:48.416 --> 01:07:52.309
It'll be fine.
It's okay, we've got quite a robust plan.

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:56.184
Guys, I mean... You'll be fine.

01:07:56.208 --> 01:07:59.142
You'll be fine. You'll be
absolutely fine, you'll have a lovely time,

01:07:59.166 --> 01:08:01.166
and I'm going to...
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:07.267
What a lovely house. Yeah, it's his parents'
house, it's not his. It looks good.

01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:09.476
Jeffrey! How are you?

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.642
I've got some people with me.

01:08:10.666 --> 01:08:12.476
Great, the more the merrier.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.851
Hi.
Hi.

01:08:13.875 --> 01:08:16.225
Rachel, do you remember me?

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.600
Rachel.
Fucking hell, you look great.

01:08:19.625 --> 01:08:21.142
Hello, mate.
You know Oliver.

01:08:21.166 --> 01:08:24.707
Yeah.
Hi, mate. Thank you.

01:08:26.582 --> 01:08:27.500
Alright, you're alright, mate.

01:08:29.582 --> 01:08:30.832
Do you mind if I...

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:34.350
What a lovely barbecue.
Yeah.

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:36.892
I bought some extra corn just
in case any more women were coming.

01:08:36.916 --> 01:08:39.350
So corn for the girls...
Meat for the boys.

01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:41.125
Oh, that's considerate.

01:08:42.125 --> 01:08:43.166
What're you doing here?

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:46.582
Jeff asked me to come along.

01:08:49.582 --> 01:08:53.875
Okay, but why did you
come to the barbecue?

01:08:57.625 --> 01:08:58.916
I wanted to see you.

01:09:02.125 --> 01:09:03.250
Right.

01:09:05.166 --> 01:09:11.434
It's quite hot with that there, isn't it?
I like it.

01:09:11.457 --> 01:09:13.517
What about you, I mean...
God, well I've been travelling

01:09:13.541 --> 01:09:14.892
a lot, actually, for work.

01:09:14.916 --> 01:09:17.267
Have you?
Yeah.

01:09:17.291 --> 01:09:19.809
Can I ask you something?
Go on.

01:09:19.832 --> 01:09:23.350
I don't want to be rude, but
could you open your coat a bit?

01:09:23.375 --> 01:09:27.559
Just a bit so I could see just
what's going on under there?

01:09:27.582 --> 01:09:30.457
Yeah, that is tremendous.

01:09:32.082 --> 01:09:33.350
You see how I handled that.

01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:34.892
Very good.

01:09:34.916 --> 01:09:38.500
Stoicism.
And then it just goes away.

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:42.517
I prefer that thing that I do,
like that.

01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:45.225
That's just work, is it? What kind of
work you do? What are you doing now?

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:46.809
Bats.
You're working with bats?

01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:48.184
Yeah.
Fuck me, well that's great.

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:51.267
I mean, you could, if you want.

01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:53.582
That is good. Do you know what?
For someone your size and shape,

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.934
that is solid.
Thank you.

01:09:56.958 --> 01:09:59.392
Remember that barbecue
we had down on the beach?

01:09:59.416 --> 01:10:01.625
I looked really young.
Yeah.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.875
Look, what you've done to me.

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:05.666
It's alright.

01:10:07.125 --> 01:10:09.559
I like your wrinkles.
There are no wrinkles!

01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:11.458
Okay. Sorry,
there are no wrinkles.

01:10:13.541 --> 01:10:15.875
If there were, I'd like them.
I know you would.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.809
I started doing poetry now,

01:10:18.833 --> 01:10:21.017
so I'm not just,
you know, a muscle man.

01:10:21.041 --> 01:10:23.601
I'm also an artist.
It's like:

01:10:23.625 --> 01:10:27.017
Look at you, look at you,
your eyes so brown

01:10:27.041 --> 01:10:30.351
I'd really like to hear
your sex sound

01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:33.601
I'd like to lie down
with you on your front

01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:37.101
or turn you over
and ignore your...

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:39.684
I just have lots of things... I
have other ideas that I have.

01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:42.309
So good.
Poetry? Since when?

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:44.934
Since ages. It's just like
I look at something

01:10:44.958 --> 01:10:47.684
and if I'm inspired by it,
then I'll do a poem like:

01:10:47.708 --> 01:10:50.976
Jeffrey, Jeffrey,
your timing's quite shit.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.184
Jeffrey, Jeffrey, could you
get the fuck out of it?

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:57.184
Jeffrey, Jeffrey,
we've got a thing happening.

01:10:57.208 --> 01:11:00.416
Jeffrey, Jeffrey,
your presence is crappening.

01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:20.226
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:24.208
I'm just trying to
hold on to something.

01:11:27.125 --> 01:11:28.541
I don't work without you.

01:11:32.333 --> 01:11:36.375
Simple as that, I just
don't... work without you.

01:11:40.541 --> 01:11:42.476
Matt!
Don't call him.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.267
Matt!
Yeah?

01:11:44.291 --> 01:11:46.541
Could you take me back
to your flat, please?

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:51.892
I'm sort of alright here
with Rachel, as it goes.

01:11:51.916 --> 01:11:53.934
Oh yeah.
We're really getting on.

01:11:53.958 --> 01:11:56.976
We haven't...
Okay, no, no, enjoy.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.250
You can't leave now.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.184
It's for the best, isn't it?

01:12:02.208 --> 01:12:03.666
Yeah.
It's all okay.

01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:07.059
Take care.

01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:09.059
You know, for someone so fit,

01:12:09.083 --> 01:12:11.476
she's really like complicated.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.142
What, because she looks like
that, she can't be complicated?

01:12:14.166 --> 01:12:16.642
I just think,
why bother, like...

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.142
Why bother with what?
With what? Just coming

01:12:19.166 --> 01:12:21.184
and taking her off me, breaking
her heart, breaking my heart?

01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:26.226
Listen, if you want her back,
you know, I wish you luck, mate.

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:29.767
That's it, so I just have her back, now?
That's it, so you've moved on, now?

01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:32.767
I'm saying you should fight for her
because she's, you know, a nightmare

01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:35.101
and I want you to have that.

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:37.601
So, you want...
You know what, I do want that,

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:38.934
and I wouldn't
make it a nightmare.

01:12:38.958 --> 01:12:40.976
What have I said mates are for?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.017
Mates are for stepping aside when...
Okay, thank you for

01:12:43.041 --> 01:12:44.434
stepping aside.
...Love is in the way.

01:12:57.291 --> 01:13:00.767
It's always,
always going to be complicated

01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:03.833
and you're never
going to have a nine to five.

01:13:05.125 --> 01:13:10.101
He knew very well who I was

01:13:10.125 --> 01:13:11.166
when he married me.

01:13:14.708 --> 01:13:15.684
And he loved it.

01:13:22.541 --> 01:13:25.059
So, we've accepted
that there are complications

01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:29.666
with me constantly changing,
being a fucking moody bitch,

01:13:32.291 --> 01:13:33.726
and he has to adjust to that

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:35.517
and I have to adjust to him.

01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:37.000
He worships me.

01:13:38.375 --> 01:13:40.500
I mean, he did.

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:48.642
He used to,
just not at the moment.

01:13:58.125 --> 01:13:59.250
Is it cold, though?

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:02.458
It is cold. It is cold.
It is cold.

01:14:05.666 --> 01:14:07.559
You've got your play,

01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:10.458
you've got your play,
finally, Gillian.

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:16.458
And you're miserable.
The fuck!

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:21.666
Am I going to be the only one
sitting at my fucking play?

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:26.142
I want him to care about me.
I really do want him to.

01:14:26.166 --> 01:14:28.934
I care about...
I care about him seeing it.

01:14:28.958 --> 01:14:31.458
I need him to see it,
I want him to see it, I want...

01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:34.642
Say hello, we'll
send this one to your mom.

01:14:34.666 --> 01:14:36.142
Hi, Janet.

01:14:36.166 --> 01:14:37.625
Mom.

01:14:41.625 --> 01:14:44.476
Should I try the trick?
Wind's going to take it.

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.684
Go on.

01:14:46.708 --> 01:14:49.184
How the fuck did I hurt myself?
Did it hurt you?

01:14:49.208 --> 01:14:51.476
But you could have
had it differently.

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.392
He could've sat there with you,

01:14:53.416 --> 01:14:55.559
watching your play with you

01:14:55.583 --> 01:14:58.392
being so fucking proud of you.

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:06.017
Oh, god. Please show up, please
show up, please show up.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.559
Dear, Oliver,
I'm not the perfect wife,

01:15:27.583 --> 01:15:32.851
that's for sure, and I realize
you could leave at any point

01:15:32.875 --> 01:15:35.000
and make someone else
wildly happy,

01:15:36.541 --> 01:15:40.458
but please, please stick around.

01:15:41.666 --> 01:15:45.541
I'm getting there.
Love, honey-pie.

01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:48.833
How are you gonna pitch it?

01:15:51.166 --> 01:15:55.250
I'm just going to go in, I'm going to say:
"I think you need to come and see this."

01:16:00.041 --> 01:16:01.934
I'm going to give him another try.
It's not going to work,

01:16:01.958 --> 01:16:03.351
I just called him a second...
Straight to voicemail.

01:16:03.375 --> 01:16:05.434
Like I said, I just called him.

01:16:05.458 --> 01:16:06.726
It went straight to voicemail.

01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:10.559
Oliver! It's Jeffrey!
Call me!

01:16:10.583 --> 01:16:13.684
We're going to just have to presume
that we're going ahead without him.

01:16:13.708 --> 01:16:16.642
So, you've tried him, I've
left him multiple text messages,

01:16:16.666 --> 01:16:18.476
I'm sure.
Does he not care?

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.392
That's what I don't understand,
does he not care?

01:16:20.416 --> 01:16:24.642
I'm sure he... you know what,
actually, I don't care.

01:16:24.666 --> 01:16:26.184
No, I care about this,
I don't care.

01:16:26.208 --> 01:16:31.017
If he makes it, he makes it.

01:16:31.041 --> 01:16:33.642
Okay, you go, and I'll park up.

01:16:33.666 --> 01:16:35.142
Okay.
See you in a sec.

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:36.125
Yeah.

01:16:50.416 --> 01:16:51.666
Bothered?

01:16:58.875 --> 01:17:00.041
Olly!

01:17:48.125 --> 01:17:49.083
Olly!

01:18:15.166 --> 01:18:16.416
Oliver?

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:25.375
I'm sorry.

01:18:36.625 --> 01:18:38.392
Hello, are you Jerry?
Please don't touch me.

01:18:38.416 --> 01:18:40.351
You need to come with me now.
Would you be willing to

01:18:40.375 --> 01:18:41.559
do that with me, now?
Get your hands off me,

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:42.642
I don't want you touching me.

01:18:42.666 --> 01:18:45.851
Jerry. Sorry about him.

01:18:45.875 --> 01:18:48.642
Hi, I'm Rachel. You don't know me,
no.

01:18:48.666 --> 01:18:50.476
You don't know my friend.
No.

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:51.642
I wondered if there's any way

01:18:51.666 --> 01:18:53.184
that we could show you

01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:54.291
this performance?

01:18:56.583 --> 01:18:59.517
I feel like I'm in a piece
of theater right now.

01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:02.642
Just a bit of a different way. I'm
used to people just posting a script.

01:19:02.666 --> 01:19:05.809
Right, no, obviously.
I've heard a lot about you.

01:19:05.833 --> 01:19:07.892
You've a very good
reputation in the industry.

01:19:07.916 --> 01:19:10.226
Who told you that?

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:14.059
I googled it.
You googled me, did you?

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:19.392
Yeah, it's quite
an impressive thread.

01:19:19.416 --> 01:19:21.351
You are winning me over,

01:19:21.375 --> 01:19:25.017
sort of mesmerizing me into
like going somewhere with you.

01:19:25.041 --> 01:19:28.250
Is he coming too, this oaf?
Yeah, this way, yeah.

01:19:33.291 --> 01:19:35.767
Excuse me, sorry, hi.
Hi.

01:19:35.791 --> 01:19:37.684
Actually, we're
not quite ready yet,

01:19:37.708 --> 01:19:41.101
almost though. So, just
wait over there a minute.

01:19:41.125 --> 01:19:43.267
Hi. Yeah, not ready yet,

01:19:43.291 --> 01:19:46.851
almost, you're early.
Hi, Jeff.

01:19:46.875 --> 01:19:49.559
We're going to just have
to start without olly.

01:19:49.583 --> 01:19:51.392
Okay. Alright.

01:19:51.416 --> 01:19:54.017
Everyone, hi.
Thanks for coming.

01:19:54.041 --> 01:19:56.226
Boy, what a show we've
got for you tonight.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:20:00.392
This is actually written by
a new writer, Gillian Walker.

01:20:00.416 --> 01:20:03.875
So, please, come in,
take a seat and enjoy the show.

01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:09.875
Are you ready?
Yeah, I'll be right there.

01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:35.000
Not you.
Not me, alright.

01:20:36.166 --> 01:20:39.351
I feel like I'm in prison.
Yes, I know what you mean.

01:20:39.375 --> 01:20:42.392
Is that intended?
Jilly wanted to have a kind of

01:20:42.416 --> 01:20:46.142
incarcerated beat
in the narrative.

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:49.476
Just on to that, next.
Okay, I'm feeling a bit manhandled, now.

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.226
Sorry.
It's about oppression of women, right?

01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:54.226
Yeah, I'm getting it right

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:57.726
because I felt like he's
my owner, or my executioner.

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:01.392
Watch your head, get in.

01:21:01.416 --> 01:21:05.666
Okay, everything is going
to be absolutely fine.

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:12.184
Who do you fancy?
Who do I fancy?

01:21:12.208 --> 01:21:17.184
In here, right now. If I wasn't
around, who'd you be eyeing up?

01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:21.434
That's a trick question, I'm not
falling for that. Who do you fancy?

01:21:21.458 --> 01:21:23.393
Where are we now?

01:21:23.417 --> 01:21:28.226
Very nearly there. This
is your new theater space.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:32.309
Your new theatrical experience.
Why are you so defensive?

01:21:32.333 --> 01:21:34.976
It's not like I'm saying: "Pick
someone and fuck them," is it?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.892
You're being silly, Jill and I'm
not playing your games. Who do you fancy?

01:21:39.916 --> 01:21:43.017
Cracking ass.
My ass.

01:21:43.041 --> 01:21:46.809
Your ass is middle-aged,
flabby and spotty.

01:21:46.833 --> 01:21:51.767
Oi, that's... well, yeah,
actually that's fair enough.

01:21:51.791 --> 01:21:53.601
Literally, it was exhausting,

01:21:53.625 --> 01:21:55.851
like all the
things that are awesome

01:21:55.875 --> 01:21:59.059
in the world, at one time.
Forget about it.

01:21:59.083 --> 01:22:02.809
He was so embarrassed, he
didn't have a clue where to look.

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:05.017
If he wants to
fuck around with Raquel...

01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:07.809
But John said she was okay.

01:22:07.833 --> 01:22:12.059
Tits, ass, fannies, cocks.

01:22:12.083 --> 01:22:15.392
Oh, my god, that sounds amazing!

01:22:15.416 --> 01:22:19.476
It was bad. Until he didn't get
up with the kids in the morning.

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.601
It was your turn.

01:22:21.625 --> 01:22:25.392
I was pounded last night,

01:22:25.416 --> 01:22:27.726
I'm still sore.
Pounded.

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:29.184
Oh, I can feel your pain!

01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:41.041
Slow. Deep, deep slow.

01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:48.476
Move, deep, move!
Move!

01:22:51.916 --> 01:22:54.226
I feel so lonely.

01:25:06.958 --> 01:25:08.291
I love you.

01:25:09.958 --> 01:25:12.000
I never want to be
without you again.
