Sounds like we're both making moves.

using the coffee maker in the morning.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.341
Oh, I couldn't figure out
the coffee maker.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.676
We just used the stove.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.264
Bed. Morning. Go.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.599
[sighs wearily]

23:54.683 --> 23:57.769
Oh, and brush your teeth.
You're too young for coffee breath.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.857
[sighs] All right, come on, Sydney,
I gotta get you home.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.193
Maybe we'll stop for some ice cream
to discuss what we tell Mommy,

24:05.277 --> 24:07.487
but the story's gotta be tight,
'cause she's a cop.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.908
Good night. Sydney,
the next time I watch you,

24:12.701 --> 24:14.035
I'll actually watch you.

24:14.911 --> 24:16.163
Good night, Grandma Ree-Ree.

24:17.539 --> 24:18.665
It's just Ree-Ree.

24:19.583 --> 24:20.625
Good night, Mom.

24:23.920 --> 24:27.424
[Lucretia] Maya! It's Auntie.
Put down whatever you're holding.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.676
Maya? What?

24:29.759 --> 24:31.261
You been here the whole time?

24:32.345 --> 24:33.889
Of course. I'm a good mother.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.766
Well, I thought there was an emergency.

24:36.850 --> 24:40.270
Got me rushing over here,
leaving Frank on his one night in town.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.147
I ain't call you.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.357
Y'all suck.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.406
Like she the only one having a bad night.

24:51.990 --> 24:52.949
You suck.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.373
Bad news.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.918
We ain't passing the inspection.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.214
The hell happened to you?

25:07.297 --> 25:08.965
I fell out the ceiling.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.636
Baby, are you all right?
You could have a concussion.

25:12.719 --> 25:13.845
No, I'm good.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.223
Bad news.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.849
We ain't passing the inspection.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.064
