- Ah!
- Oh!

01:08.801 --> 01:11.235
I suggested having this lesson
in the cemetery

01:11.237 --> 01:14.205
because I thought you
couldn't <i> kill</i> anyone here.

01:14.207 --> 01:18.576
But now I'm afraid
you're disturbing the dead!

01:20.212 --> 01:23.180
Before they bury me,

01:23.182 --> 01:26.183
get me to a pay phone.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.823
I need to call
another instructor for you.

01:32.825 --> 01:37.528
I just...can't...
take it anymore!

01:45.138 --> 01:48.839
Aah! Ah! Uhh!

01:51.276 --> 01:53.978
- Huh? You stopped in
front of the prison?

01:53.980 --> 02:00.251
Never mind! Any place is better
than in this boat with you!

02:07.226 --> 02:09.759
- What are ya waiting for?
Step on it!

02:09.762 --> 02:11.796
- You must be the new
driving instructor.

02:15.101 --> 02:17.701
Student driver.
That's me.

02:17.703 --> 02:21.906
I just don't take
a bad picture, do I?

02:21.908 --> 02:23.174
- Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

02:23.176 --> 02:25.209
I'm your new
driving instructor.

02:25.211 --> 02:28.846
- Great! Look at how I can
tune the radio.

02:29.382 --> 02:30.748
<i>- Breaking News!</i>
Huh?

02:30.750 --> 02:32.550
<i>- Notorious criminal</i>
<i>Sticky Fins Whiting</i>

02:32.552 --> 02:34.952
<i>has just escaped from prison.</i>

02:34.954 --> 02:37.555
- Very good
radio tuning skills.

02:37.557 --> 02:40.024
Now,
drive as fast as you can!

02:42.695 --> 02:44.628
- Stop! SpongeBob!

02:44.630 --> 02:45.696
Come back!

02:45.698 --> 02:49.633
I can't believe
I said that!

02:50.803 --> 02:52.670
- Sticky Fins,
where are you?

02:52.672 --> 02:54.638
I can't be that late.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.840
- Follow that sponge!

02:55.842 --> 02:57.074
- You ain't Sticky Fins.

02:57.076 --> 02:59.276
- And you ain't
a chocolate cake!

02:59.278 --> 03:00.144
Now, step on it!

03:00.146 --> 03:02.713
- Yes, ma'am!
Dorsal Dan at your service!

03:08.955 --> 03:10.788
Oh! Oh!

03:10.790 --> 03:14.358
Crater-face! We're being
followed. Lose that tail!

03:14.360 --> 03:17.061
- I thought it'd made me
look cool.

03:17.063 --> 03:18.329
Guess not.

03:18.331 --> 03:21.665
- Not that tail!
The cops behind us!

03:21.667 --> 03:22.933
Drive crazy!

03:22.935 --> 03:25.269
- Ohhhhhh, that I can do!

03:29.976 --> 03:32.910
Yah-ha-ha-ha!

03:32.912 --> 03:34.211
Oh, yeah!

03:38.317 --> 03:41.185
- Wow! He's driving
like a psycho!

03:41.187 --> 03:42.953
Who taught him
how to drive?

03:48.793 --> 03:52.062
Good baby?

03:52.064 --> 03:54.798
- Waaaaaahhhhh!

03:57.169 --> 03:58.769
- Gosh!

03:58.771 --> 04:01.372
I say,
how's my automobiling?

04:01.374 --> 04:02.873
Simply smashing.

04:02.875 --> 04:06.410
You're simply
smashing into things!

04:08.481 --> 04:10.948
Let's see what's on the menu!

04:10.950 --> 04:12.349
Oh! I'll take those.

04:12.351 --> 04:13.284
Hmm?

04:23.729 --> 04:25.829
- Oh! Oh-ohhh!

04:25.831 --> 04:30.267
- Excuse me sir, I'm in the
middle of a driving lesson.

04:30.269 --> 04:32.703
- Aah!

04:32.705 --> 04:34.038
- Look out, you maniac!

04:40.980 --> 04:44.081
- You're going the wrong way!
Turn this thing around!

04:44.083 --> 04:47.017
- You got it!
Turning around!

04:49.689 --> 04:52.423
- Oh, you're a great instructor!
What now?

04:52.425 --> 04:55.426
- Just...go with the flow.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.198
- Looks like they shook us.
Don't worry, we'll find them.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.802
- They'll probably revoke my
teacher's license for this.

05:04.804 --> 05:08.005
- Hey, I'm a teacher too!
I teach all kinds of things.

05:08.007 --> 05:10.941
Safe cracking,
burglary, getaway driving.

05:10.943 --> 05:14.478
I did notice
you're a very good driver.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.015
- Ha ha, you ain't such a bad
passenger yourself.

05:18.017 --> 05:20.417
Oh, my!

05:24.489 --> 05:27.958
- Here's your next test.
Follow me.

05:28.226 --> 05:30.160
Distracted drivers
are dangerous.

05:30.162 --> 05:33.430
I want you to distract that
salesman in the store.

05:33.432 --> 05:36.934
- I don't understand how this is
gonna help with my driving.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.203
- It's, uh...
abstract thinking.

05:39.205 --> 05:42.239
- Hey, I've heard of that!

05:44.009 --> 05:44.908
- Welcome!

05:44.910 --> 05:47.211
- Distract with the abstract.

05:51.784 --> 05:55.185
- Hey, shapes and noises!
I love it!

06:08.868 --> 06:10.100
- What's the next lesson?

06:10.102 --> 06:11.769
- The nearest
electronics store.

06:11.771 --> 06:15.205
- Oh, you really know how to
challenge a guy.

06:20.945 --> 06:24.181
- Help! Help!
I've been robbed!

06:24.183 --> 06:26.016
- I've shopped in that place
before,

06:26.018 --> 06:28.252
and I've been robbed too.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.955
- What now, beautiful?
- I wouldn't mind

06:31.957 --> 06:35.325
seeing you navigate
a four-way stop.

06:35.327 --> 06:38.362
- Romance always has
the right of way.

06:38.364 --> 06:39.963
- Oh, my!

06:44.336 --> 06:46.070
- Ah!
Wha--

06:46.072 --> 06:47.404
Oop.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.575
Whoa!

07:01.353 --> 07:04.121
- I need to launder
these bills--fast!

07:04.123 --> 07:05.255
- I know just the place!

07:05.257 --> 07:07.157
But first,
let me adjust your seat.

07:07.159 --> 07:08.058
- Ooh!

07:08.060 --> 07:10.227
Hey! What's the big idea?

07:22.374 --> 07:25.909
- What is wrong with you?

07:27.278 --> 07:29.480
- I think your sponge should be
around here somewhere.

07:29.482 --> 07:32.316
I didn't even
feel you slow down.

07:32.318 --> 07:35.853
You've got such a gentle foot
on the pedal.

07:35.855 --> 07:41.325
- Gosh. No one's ever said
I had a gentle foot before.

07:41.327 --> 07:42.926
- Oh-ho.

07:42.928 --> 07:44.495
Oh! Oh!

07:48.067 --> 07:50.334
SpongeBob!

07:51.537 --> 07:53.971
- Why's that jerk honking?

07:53.973 --> 07:56.540
Go! Drive!

07:57.108 --> 07:59.209
- Sorry about
your gentle foot!

07:59.211 --> 08:02.079
Hi-yah!
- Hey--Owww!

08:05.583 --> 08:06.416
- Oh!

08:06.418 --> 08:09.419
Ooh, driving Range!

08:10.388 --> 08:12.089
- Oh--oh!

08:16.028 --> 08:17.427
- How's my driving?

08:17.429 --> 08:18.262
- Oh!

08:18.264 --> 08:20.664
Doh-doh-doh-doh-doh--

08:21.266 --> 08:24.668
- Doh! That kinda hurts,
don't ya think?

08:24.670 --> 08:26.603
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

08:30.141 --> 08:30.707
Pfffffttt!

08:30.709 --> 08:34.645
For the love of Neptune,
let's get outta here!

08:34.647 --> 08:37.481
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

08:37.482 --> 08:40.150
Oh!

08:41.287 --> 08:43.086
Oh, yeah.

08:46.925 --> 08:48.692
- Aah!
Ha ha!

08:49.995 --> 08:51.228
Ooh!

08:51.230 --> 08:52.196
Ow!

08:53.132 --> 08:54.998
Oh!

08:56.068 --> 08:58.468
Ooh--ow!

08:58.470 --> 09:00.204
Aaaaaaaah!

09:07.580 --> 09:09.479
I just wanna know...

09:09.481 --> 09:12.516
what'd I ever do
to deserve this?

09:12.518 --> 09:15.452
- Would you like to test me
on road signs now?

09:15.454 --> 09:19.056
Let's see...

09:19.058 --> 09:20.324
"Stop,"

09:20.326 --> 09:21.158
"No Left Turn,"

09:21.160 --> 09:23.060
and that one over there
that says

09:23.062 --> 09:24.428
"Falling Rocks!!!"

09:24.430 --> 09:26.396
- Wait, what?
Ooh!

09:26.398 --> 09:27.664
Oof!

09:30.069 --> 09:32.102
Whoa!

09:33.037 --> 09:34.071
- Mm-mm-mm-mm--

09:34.073 --> 09:35.973
Oh!

09:35.975 --> 09:37.207
- Aaaaahhhh!

09:42.481 --> 09:44.181
SpongeBob!

09:44.183 --> 09:45.382
- Mrs. Puff!

09:45.384 --> 09:46.483
- Sticky Fins!

09:46.485 --> 09:47.985
- Dorsal Dan!

09:47.987 --> 09:49.586
Help meeeee!

09:49.588 --> 09:51.421
- Hey, Mrs. Puff!
The new instructor's been

09:51.423 --> 09:54.024
teaching me so much.
Not as much as you.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.225
But y'know, different things.

09:55.227 --> 09:59.096
- SpongeBob, you gotta keep
your eyes on the road!

09:59.098 --> 10:01.698
- He hasn't taught me
that one yet!

10:01.700 --> 10:03.166
Oh!

10:04.269 --> 10:06.136
- Oh!
- Ah!

10:09.675 --> 10:12.142
- Ah! Get me outta here!

10:12.778 --> 10:14.378
- Aww,
you must be hungry.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.281
I've got some of
Gary's Snail Snacks.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.488
- This is the police.
Pull over!

10:27.660 --> 10:30.360
- Right turn!
Make a right turn!

10:30.362 --> 10:32.596
- Aye, aye, professor!

10:39.271 --> 10:41.605
Yes! I'm back!

10:41.607 --> 10:43.507
Thank Neptune!

10:43.509 --> 10:45.375
Don't let me out
ever again!

10:45.377 --> 10:46.710
It's not safe out there!

10:46.712 --> 10:50.347
Lock me away!
Forever, and ever!

10:50.349 --> 10:52.249
Huh?

10:54.085 --> 10:57.387
- Warden, I found this one
pulling up outside the prison.

10:57.389 --> 11:00.490
- Dorsal Dan! The notorious
getaway driver.

11:00.492 --> 11:02.059
Toss him in the clink!

11:03.696 --> 11:06.163
I'll wait for you,

11:06.165 --> 11:08.532
my little tenderfoot!

11:10.536 --> 11:12.402
- Aaaaaah!

11:12.404 --> 11:13.770
Whoa!

11:13.772 --> 11:15.505
Hey, where'd
the new instructor go?

11:15.507 --> 11:17.574
Oh, well, I still
have ten minutes left

11:17.576 --> 11:19.343
on my driving lesson.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.678
Oh, Mrs. Puff?

11:24.283 --> 11:25.415
Oh...waaaah!

11:25.417 --> 11:27.484
I'll confess to anything!

11:27.486 --> 11:29.252
Throw away the key!

11:29.254 --> 11:32.189
It's not safe out here!

11:32.191 --> 11:35.759
<i>Let me in!</i>

11:36.561 --> 11:41.765
Drive safely,
and always wear your seat belt!

11:58.951 --> 12:00.417
- Hmm.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.623
- SpongeBob! Where are those
patties?

12:06.625 --> 12:10.260
<i>- Coming right...down,</i>
<i>Squidward.</i>

12:10.262 --> 12:12.496
- What are you talking about,
SpongeBob?

12:12.498 --> 12:13.697
Don't you mean
coming right up?

12:13.699 --> 12:17.234
- Mmm...
- I don't see what you're--

12:18.369 --> 12:19.636
Aah!

12:19.638 --> 12:22.739
- Nice catch, Squidward!

12:22.741 --> 12:23.974
- Thanks...

12:26.945 --> 12:27.911
- Whoo!

12:29.615 --> 12:31.748
- I want my teddy fish!

12:31.750 --> 12:32.983
Waaaaah!
- Ha ha, all right,

12:32.985 --> 12:36.853
don't worry, little boy,
we'll find it!

12:36.855 --> 12:37.988
This kid lost his toy.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.790
SpongeBob, I need you to check
the Lost and Found.

12:39.792 --> 12:43.860
- Ooh! I didn't know
we had a Lost and Found.

12:43.862 --> 12:46.029
- I love my teddy fish!

12:49.700 --> 12:51.768
- You better find it quick,
SpongeBob.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.971
Kid's bawlin' is chasing
me customers away.

12:54.973 --> 12:56.473
Follow me, boy-o!

12:56.475 --> 12:58.475
- Waaaaaaah!

13:01.647 --> 13:03.547
- Is there a ladder?

13:03.549 --> 13:05.015
- Yes.

13:05.017 --> 13:07.451
- Aaaaahhh!

13:07.453 --> 13:08.552
Aaaaah!

13:08.554 --> 13:11.354
- Here's the ladder, boy-o!
- Okay, I--

13:12.357 --> 13:13.323
Nice catch!

13:16.527 --> 13:17.360
Ow!

13:17.362 --> 13:20.363
- Now, try not to get bit
by anything poisonous!

13:20.365 --> 13:22.599
- What?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

13:22.601 --> 13:23.834
Good luck!

13:23.836 --> 13:27.070
- Oh, this must be
the Lost and Found!

13:28.005 --> 13:29.406
It's not in here!

13:29.408 --> 13:31.908
- Try turning on the lights!

13:34.980 --> 13:38.315
Oh! Whoa!

13:38.317 --> 13:40.817
Whoa!

13:40.819 --> 13:43.320
Wow! Lost umbrellas!

13:43.322 --> 13:44.721
Lost flip flops!

13:44.723 --> 13:46.456
Lost keys! Lost remotes!

13:46.458 --> 13:51.328
Oh! A whole, entire shelf of
lost "cool guy" shades!

13:51.330 --> 13:54.664
Now, that's a sight
for more eyes.

13:58.436 --> 13:59.870
Oh, no pictures, please.

13:59.872 --> 14:03.640
Did you get my good side?

14:08.013 --> 14:10.413
What a funny echo.

14:10.415 --> 14:11.047
Ha...ha.

14:14.786 --> 14:16.453
Hey!

14:16.455 --> 14:19.489
There's bric-a-brac

14:19.491 --> 14:20.190
and gee-gaws!

14:20.192 --> 14:24.561
I wonder
if there's tchotchkes!

14:24.563 --> 14:25.629
Oh! Oh!

14:25.631 --> 14:27.631
Tchotchkes!

14:27.633 --> 14:29.799
Lost novelty items!

14:29.801 --> 14:31.701
Wow!

14:31.703 --> 14:34.538
I love lost novelty items!

14:34.540 --> 14:35.605
Ooh!

14:35.607 --> 14:36.773
Uh-uh-eh-eh-uh--

14:36.775 --> 14:39.609
Excuse me!

14:39.611 --> 14:41.778
Oh!

14:41.780 --> 14:42.445
Ah!

14:52.958 --> 14:54.991
Whaa!

14:54.993 --> 14:56.092
Aah!

15:03.501 --> 15:07.604
Oh, thank you,
cymbal-clapping sea chimps!

15:07.606 --> 15:08.772
What is this?

15:08.774 --> 15:11.141
Looks like Bikini Bottom.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.952
Yee! Eee-eee-eee!

15:21.954 --> 15:23.053
Whew!

15:23.055 --> 15:24.421
Whoa!

15:25.724 --> 15:28.458
- Hey, Mr. Krabs,
you know that annoying

15:28.460 --> 15:30.427
crying kid?

15:30.429 --> 15:32.996
He's still crying...
and it's still annoying!

15:32.998 --> 15:35.065
- Squidward,
I'm glad you're here.

15:35.067 --> 15:38.702
I think SpongeBob may be lost
in the Lost and Found.

15:38.704 --> 15:42.205
- And this concerns me how,
exactly?

15:42.207 --> 15:43.106
Wait--what?!

15:43.108 --> 15:44.741
Aaaaahhhhhh!
- Don't worry.

15:44.743 --> 15:46.042
There's a ladder.

15:50.215 --> 15:53.149
- And find that toy...

15:53.151 --> 15:54.684
pronto!

15:58.956 --> 16:02.158
Whoa! Are you the people
of the too-small clothes?

16:02.160 --> 16:06.529
- No. We were children,
lost in the Krusty Krab

16:06.531 --> 16:08.665
over 60 years ago,

16:08.667 --> 16:10.166
and we were never claimed.

16:10.168 --> 16:11.534
- Did you drop a box
on my head?

16:11.536 --> 16:14.871
- Of course!
It's how we say hello.

16:14.873 --> 16:15.739
- Oh!

16:15.741 --> 16:17.974
Hello!
- Hello.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.844
- Oh, no...looks like
I'm lost now too.

16:20.846 --> 16:24.681
- Don't worry. You are found
and can live with us now.

16:24.683 --> 16:27.717
- How did you survive
down here all this time?

16:27.719 --> 16:30.587
- People leave
all kinds of things behind.

16:30.589 --> 16:32.222
Like gum. And mints.

16:32.224 --> 16:35.258
They leave lots of mints.

16:39.530 --> 16:41.064
- Your breath
is delightfully fresh.

16:41.066 --> 16:45.068
Bring on the welcoming feast!

16:46.103 --> 16:49.039
Welcoming feast!

16:51.943 --> 16:53.810
- Dig in!

16:58.783 --> 17:01.818
Ooh...

17:04.755 --> 17:08.058
- Hey, little dolly.
You must be getting hungry!

17:08.060 --> 17:09.291
- Oh, hey!

17:09.294 --> 17:10.292
That's the teddy fish!

17:10.295 --> 17:12.529
My boss, Mr. Krabs,
told me to grab that.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.130
Thank you!
- Grr! This?

17:14.132 --> 17:16.965
I found it, so...
finders keepers!

17:16.968 --> 17:22.605
- Finders keepers.
Finders keepers.

17:22.906 --> 17:24.307
- Huh?
- Yoink!

17:24.309 --> 17:26.309
Losers weepers!

17:26.310 --> 17:29.012
- He is using our sacred words
against us!

17:29.014 --> 17:32.015
- That's my teddy fish!
Get him!

17:32.017 --> 17:37.020
- Sorry, but this has to go back
to its rightful owner!

17:40.926 --> 17:43.927
- Run...like the wind...

17:45.162 --> 17:47.897
- Moron!
I mean, SpongeBoooob?!

17:47.899 --> 17:52.769
I can't believe Old Man Krabs
has held on to all this stuff.

17:52.771 --> 17:54.771
Oooh! Kazoos!

17:54.773 --> 17:59.042
Why, I had a kazoo
when I was a child...

17:59.044 --> 18:01.945
<i>Everybody loved it!</i>

18:07.018 --> 18:09.319
- Oh! Ow! My ears!

18:13.324 --> 18:14.624
- These are clarinets!!

18:14.626 --> 18:17.127
In fact, these are
all <i> my</i> clarinets!

18:17.129 --> 18:19.863
Wait a minute--
these weren't lost!

18:19.865 --> 18:22.298
They were all in my locker!

18:22.300 --> 18:23.833
Mmm...

18:23.835 --> 18:25.602
Now what could that possibly--

18:25.604 --> 18:26.202
Uhhh!

18:34.312 --> 18:35.845
Typical.

18:35.847 --> 18:40.283
- Squidward? SpongeBob?

18:40.285 --> 18:43.753
It's the curse
of the Lost and Found:

18:43.755 --> 18:46.122
no one ever gets found.

18:46.124 --> 18:49.259
They just stay lost.

18:51.362 --> 18:52.228
Oh, well, back to work.

18:52.230 --> 18:55.198
- Waaaah!
- The ambiance in this place

18:55.200 --> 18:57.133
stinks!

18:57.135 --> 18:58.802
Stinky ambiance?

18:58.804 --> 19:03.173
Oooh, it's a dark time
for the Krusty Krab.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.808
- Waaaaah!

19:04.810 --> 19:07.844
- Waaaaaah!

19:09.747 --> 19:11.147
- Oh! Lost toys!

19:11.149 --> 19:13.650
Aah!

19:13.652 --> 19:17.353
- Get him!

19:17.355 --> 19:19.255
- Uhh!

19:23.662 --> 19:25.762
- Whoa--oh!

19:28.065 --> 19:30.233
Lost Toilets?

19:32.870 --> 19:34.337
- We need more speed!

19:39.845 --> 19:41.978
- Aah!
- Ohh!

19:41.980 --> 19:43.213
- Wha-ooh...

19:44.216 --> 19:46.115
- Lost Pets!

19:48.353 --> 19:50.787
- Hyah! Hyah!

19:50.789 --> 19:52.255
Mush! Mush!

19:56.895 --> 20:00.096
- Lost Mine!

20:00.098 --> 20:01.264
Whaa--

20:05.170 --> 20:07.303
- Lost world!

20:12.009 --> 20:16.479
- A hatch! Maybe
that's the emergency exit!

20:19.049 --> 20:21.050
Grease trap!?

20:30.996 --> 20:32.228
Lost dead ends?!

20:35.766 --> 20:37.734
- Give us the teddy fish!

20:37.736 --> 20:40.370
- Teddy fish!
Teddy fish!

20:40.372 --> 20:45.441
- No! This teddy fish belongs
to a poor, sweet child!

20:45.443 --> 20:47.510
Huh?

20:47.512 --> 20:48.278
Patty grease?

20:48.280 --> 20:51.948
Oh, no! I haven't cleaned
the grease trap in years!

20:51.950 --> 20:53.249
Oh, no.
- Quick!

20:53.251 --> 20:56.352
Get on each other's
shoulders.

20:57.054 --> 20:59.289
At least some of us
will survive.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.758
- Aw, come on!

21:01.760 --> 21:03.927
- Wait!
I have a better idea!

21:09.401 --> 21:12.502
- No SpongeBob,
no teddy fish,

21:12.504 --> 21:14.470
no customers!

21:16.341 --> 21:18.474
All is lost!

21:20.111 --> 21:21.244
Who is it?

21:21.246 --> 21:23.046
<i>- Tylo!</i>
- Tylo who?

21:23.048 --> 21:24.948
- Tylosaurus!

21:24.950 --> 21:28.785
- SpongeBob!
Thank Neptune you're back, son!

21:28.787 --> 21:30.153
- Oh, good to be back
Mr. Krabs,

21:30.155 --> 21:34.157
but I'm not the only one.
Look who I found!

21:34.558 --> 21:36.793
- Ack! Get back! Get back!

21:36.795 --> 21:38.995
- Ginger? Is that you?

21:38.997 --> 21:41.831
- Mom!
What are you doing here?

21:41.833 --> 21:45.034
- We come here every week.

21:45.036 --> 21:45.568
- "We"?

21:45.570 --> 21:47.971
- Yes.
Myself and your father

21:47.973 --> 21:52.542
and the other parents
of kids who were lost here.

21:52.544 --> 21:54.477
Where were you?

21:54.479 --> 21:56.279
- In the Lost and Found!

21:56.281 --> 21:59.449
There's a Lost and Found?

21:59.451 --> 22:02.385
- Hm. Maybe I should
put up a sign.

22:02.387 --> 22:04.220
- Aww, all the old people

22:04.222 --> 22:08.024
are hugging.
Uhh...ow...ow!

22:08.026 --> 22:10.093
- Dry your tears, little kid.

22:10.095 --> 22:12.462
Look! It's teddy fish!

22:12.464 --> 22:15.598
- I don't want <i> that</i> anymore!

22:15.600 --> 22:17.900
- Huh?
Mmm.

22:17.902 --> 22:20.303
- I want this! Whaaa-hooo!

22:20.305 --> 22:22.505
- Well, I guess
we all learned a lesson

22:22.507 --> 22:25.875
about being lost
and being found today.

22:25.877 --> 22:27.276
- What's that,
Mr. Krabs?

22:27.278 --> 22:29.345
- I don't know.
- Hey, speaking of lost,

22:29.347 --> 22:30.279
where's Squidward?

22:30.281 --> 22:32.915
- Ahhhhhhh!

22:32.917 --> 22:35.318
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
