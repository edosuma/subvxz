Previously on ER...

00:05.123 --> 00:07.913
If you want to stay with me, you can.

00:08.831 --> 00:11.803
- What-What are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to wake you up.

00:15.779 --> 00:17.859
Doesn't anybody here watch the news?

00:17.877 --> 00:21.513
Homeland Security raised our
threat level to orange this morning.

00:21.536 --> 00:23.611
- And what does that mean exactly?
- It means it's an election year.

00:23.633 --> 00:26.733
It means there's a severe risk
of terrorist activity,

00:26.777 --> 00:29.100
and the hospital is on full alert.
Here.

00:29.659 --> 00:31.902
- What is that?
- Emergency Protocols.

00:32.305 --> 00:35.900
Biohazard Preparedness Plan,
Evacuation Procedures.

00:35.914 --> 00:38.003
There's your basic guide
to the apocalypse.

00:38.017 --> 00:39.623
Well, are we supposed
to do anything differently?

00:39.644 --> 00:42.622
Keep your ID handy and
report anything strange or suspicious.

00:42.649 --> 00:44.712
Everything down here
is strange or suspicious.

00:44.738 --> 00:47.211
Which reminds me,
the new warden is here.

00:47.245 --> 00:48.472
Moretti?

00:50.686 --> 00:52.951
- Oh, lucky you.
- Yeah, right.

00:53.118 --> 00:56.272
I heard the ICU nurses used to take
vacation when he was on service.

00:56.488 --> 00:59.070
Hey, well, can you blame them?
The guy fired half the ICU attendings

00:59.108 --> 01:00.711
when he took over up there.

01:00.748 --> 01:02.342
Hey, Dr. Moretti.

01:07.417 --> 01:10.830
- I wish we could all go.
- Ah, it's probably better this way.

01:11.546 --> 01:14.900
I'll get my father settled and be back soon
enough so we can still go on that honeymoon.

01:15.078 --> 01:16.953
- I don't need a honeymoon.
- I do.

01:17.637 --> 01:19.450
Besides, I'd like to meet your father.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.810
And Joe wants to meet his grandpa.
Don't you, Joe?

01:24.677 --> 01:29.183
Unless you don't want me to meet your family
because I'm hideously ugly by Croatian standards.

01:31.168 --> 01:32.221
I'll miss you both.

01:32.825 --> 01:33.942
I already do.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.653
Be good for your mom, okay?

01:37.265 --> 01:38.212
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:40.746 --> 01:42.293
I'll call you when I get there.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.042
Or you could call me from the airport.

01:49.048 --> 01:51.790
Or when you land in Frankfurt,
or from the plane.

01:55.445 --> 01:56.713
Say bye to Daddy.

01:57.477 --> 01:58.571
Say bye.

02:37.826 --> 02:39.680
He's been sitting there for 20 minutes.

02:40.177 --> 02:41.791
It's a little creepy if you ask me.

02:41.876 --> 02:43.900
The guy is a burn-out.
That's why they sent him down here.

02:43.925 --> 02:46.913
The ER is the elephant
graveyard for doctors.

02:47.118 --> 02:48.943
You are an eternal
ray of sunshine, Frank.

02:48.978 --> 02:52.180
Yeah? Think about it. Where did they
send Romano after he lost his arm?

02:52.225 --> 02:54.531
Last year, it was Clemente,
now it's this guy.

02:54.595 --> 02:58.190
Dollars to donuts, we find him
hanging in an exam room by July.

02:58.217 --> 03:01.583
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- What, you and Kovac split up already?

03:02.037 --> 03:05.312
No. Uh, Luka's father got sick.
He had to fly back to Croatia.

03:05.498 --> 03:07.721
- Hope he's not flying today.
- Why?

03:07.738 --> 03:08.910
- Frank!
- What?

03:08.936 --> 03:11.080
- What's going on?
- Need a doc here.

03:12.645 --> 03:13.772
Uh, what happened?

03:13.968 --> 03:16.202
Was horsing around, put it
through a glass coffee table.

03:16.227 --> 03:18.212
He lost a lot of blood.
All over my carpet.

03:18.247 --> 03:19.881
Let's get him a room and clean him up.
Thanks, Sam.

03:19.905 --> 03:21.431
All right, keep this up.

03:27.016 --> 03:29.241
- Calder?
- That's me.

03:30.787 --> 03:32.003
This way.

03:36.247 --> 03:38.642
- 98/56.
- Yeah, I always run a bit low.

03:38.857 --> 03:41.282
Do paramedic patients stop at Triage?

03:42.028 --> 03:44.483
If they're ambulatory, they can.

03:44.848 --> 03:46.281
What meds are you on?

03:46.487 --> 03:50.560
- Enalapril, Lipitor and Glyburide.
- You diabetic?

03:51.037 --> 03:55.143
- Okay, let's get your blood sugar.
- How often is your Glucometer Q.A'd?

03:56.295 --> 03:58.700
Every morning at 7:00 by the day shift.

03:58.968 --> 04:01.811
You ask a lot of questions for
somebody who's supposed to be in charge.

04:02.037 --> 04:04.093
Well, he's... he's new.

04:04.906 --> 04:07.473
- Blood sugar's 128.
- It's been worse.

04:07.568 --> 04:08.822
It's not so bad.

04:08.996 --> 04:12.123
Once we get you registered,
they'll make you a chart,

04:12.318 --> 04:14.042
and a doctor will see you.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.343
- Is that you?
- Oh, no. No.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.533
Not today.

04:18.878 --> 04:21.273
I'm just a fly on the wall.

04:22.157 --> 04:25.533
Oh, sorry. You're through
the fascia into the extensor muscles.

04:25.555 --> 04:28.212
That one will need layered closure.
Any medical problems?

04:28.245 --> 04:31.900
Yeah, I got a detached retina.
Had a run-in at the local bar.

04:32.098 --> 04:34.973
- I got a bad back, service-related.
- You're in the military?

04:35.005 --> 04:36.973
Army. We did a tour in Iraq together.

04:37.005 --> 04:39.832
Yeah. I decided to head over to
the peace rally, pick up some chicks.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.960
- Were you three in combat?
- We were.

04:42.086 --> 04:43.723
Kyle here drove a desk.

04:43.908 --> 04:47.002
Hardly, man. As you can tell,
I'm the brain of this trio.

04:47.047 --> 04:49.020
I was with Intelligence,
worked as a translator.

04:49.058 --> 04:52.153
- He taught us how to swear in Arabic.
- Where'd you pick that up?

04:52.205 --> 04:55.431
I did some missionary work over in Jordan
for two years after high school.

04:55.478 --> 04:58.690
- Yeah, he's our Stormin' Mormon.
- Can you wiggle your fingers?

04:59.376 --> 05:01.872
- Oh, that hurts.
- Let's check the volar wounds.

05:04.295 --> 05:06.012
That would be an arterial injury.

05:06.046 --> 05:08.800
Okay, four milligrams morphine.
I'll be right back.

05:12.556 --> 05:14.262
- Hey, I got a good one for you.
- Oh, no, thanks.

05:14.276 --> 05:16.011
No, it'll be quick--
hand through a glass coffee table.

05:16.048 --> 05:18.041
- Neurovascular?
- Maybe some tendon damage.

05:18.108 --> 05:21.420
Come on, I got Moretti circling around
down here like a turkey vulture.

05:23.427 --> 05:25.661
- Have you heard from Ray?
- Yeah, he's taking some time off.

05:25.707 --> 05:28.593
He won't return my calls,
and I've tried and tried his parents.

05:28.618 --> 05:31.222
- He's not at his apartment.
- I heard his band's back in town.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.510
Maybe he's playing rock star again.

05:34.916 --> 05:36.922
- All right, does it hurt when I press?
- No.

05:37.126 --> 05:40.810
- All right, how about, how about here?
- Uh, bingo.

05:41.357 --> 05:44.362
- It's bearable, though.
- What's in your chem panel, Doctor?

05:45.568 --> 05:49.232
Lytes, BUN, creatinine,
calcium, LFT's.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.123
These are liver function tests.

05:51.247 --> 05:52.783
I thought you weren't working today.

05:52.875 --> 05:55.230
Well, you make it very hard
to resist, Mrs. Calder.

05:56.445 --> 05:58.702
You're cute, but he's a flirt.

05:59.065 --> 06:00.310
Hey, are you ready to present?

06:00.348 --> 06:03.980
Yeah. This is, uh, Dr. Lockhart.
She's my supervisor.

06:06.478 --> 06:09.873
Type II diabetic with, uh,
gastroenteritis and dehydration.

06:09.975 --> 06:13.733
Afebrile, uh, abdomen's benign,
and she's getting fluids and Compazine.

06:13.778 --> 06:17.232
Okay, try Reglan in case it's gastroparesis,
and show me the labs when they get back.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.682
- Nice to meet you.
- Excuse me.

06:19.746 --> 06:22.362
We haven't officially met yet.
I'm Kevin Moretti.

06:22.408 --> 06:24.542
- I'll be replacing your husband.
- Excuse me?

06:24.576 --> 06:28.290
- No, as Chief, only as Chief.
- Yeah. I'm, uh... I'm Abby Lockhart.

06:28.395 --> 06:31.471
- Yes. You used to be a nurse.
- Yes, I was.

06:32.307 --> 06:34.501
That must give you
an interesting perspective.

06:34.817 --> 06:36.801
Uh, I guess so, yeah.

06:37.567 --> 06:41.333
Also, being married to one of the attendings
must prove very challenging at times.

06:42.186 --> 06:44.640
Hey, Abby, could use some help over here.

06:45.218 --> 06:47.802
Got Saltzman, 27,
fell off a roof with his brother.

06:47.816 --> 06:49.712
Brother-in-law--
I landed right on his back.

06:49.736 --> 06:52.522
- I think I knocked the wind out of him.
- What were you doing?

06:54.587 --> 06:56.990
I was putting up a satellite dish.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.050
How tall was the building?

07:00.415 --> 07:01.450
Two stories?

07:01.577 --> 07:03.883
Yeah, well, he refused to be boarded
and collared, so he's all yours.

07:03.937 --> 07:05.433
Come on, let's go.
Exam three.

07:06.688 --> 07:08.562
Is... uh, is he going to wake up?

07:08.587 --> 07:10.663
Let's just take care of you first, huh?

07:10.675 --> 07:12.732
Okay. I just... I need to talk
to him as soon as he does.

07:12.775 --> 07:15.213
Hey, Abby, can you give our soldier
guy another four of morphine?

07:15.238 --> 07:17.302
- First dose didn't touched him.
- There was no first dose.

07:17.315 --> 07:19.071
- He's addicted to codeine.
- What?

07:19.147 --> 07:22.381
He's followed at the VA.
They have to be notified of all ER visits.

07:22.406 --> 07:24.780
His caseworker said
he has a no-narcotic contract.

07:24.818 --> 07:26.873
Well, we can't assess his injury
without anesthesia.

07:26.917 --> 07:29.522
What, you want him backsliding
back into addiction?

07:29.848 --> 07:33.570
Do an axillary block. A nerve block
will control the pain without narcotics.

07:33.658 --> 07:36.630
I know. I was hoping to give our resident
a chance to figure it out.

07:36.678 --> 07:38.301
- Oh, you've done it before?
- Oh, yeah.

07:38.337 --> 07:41.140
I mean, usually it's
a pain team kind of thing.

07:41.204 --> 07:45.153
A couple of cc's of lido
in the-the axilla, right?

07:45.427 --> 07:48.723
Well, more like 40.
I'll walk you through it.

07:50.404 --> 07:53.532
My husband was a lieutenant
stationed near Mosul.

07:53.719 --> 07:55.001
What unit?

07:55.117 --> 07:57.762
He was a doctor with the 57th CASH.

07:57.797 --> 07:59.381
He's out now?

08:00.587 --> 08:05.560
No. Uh, he was killed in country
a little over a year ago by an IED.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.141
Sorry to hear that, ma'am.

08:09.246 --> 08:10.433
So, what's the verdict?

08:10.508 --> 08:14.600
Has a partial lac of the flexor carpi
ulnaris. Needs a volar splint.

08:14.777 --> 08:15.860
Good luck.

08:15.915 --> 08:18.441
Thanks.
Maybe I'll see you at the rally.

08:18.857 --> 08:19.970
Maybe.

08:20.736 --> 08:24.293
My arm still hurts like hell, Doc.
You got to give me something.

08:25.128 --> 08:27.742
I got a high tolerance for
pain meds 'cause of my back.

08:27.986 --> 08:29.910
Tolerance or addiction?

08:31.316 --> 08:32.803
We talked to the VA.

08:32.876 --> 08:34.950
They told us about your contract.

08:35.655 --> 08:37.692
So, what, they said I was an addict?

08:38.126 --> 08:39.522
That's crap, man.

08:39.575 --> 08:41.672
Look, I was at Walter Reed for six weeks.

08:41.736 --> 08:44.823
I was supposed to go get physical
therapy, see a pain guy.

08:44.847 --> 08:47.651
They're so busy with amputees
and guys worse off than me,

08:47.676 --> 08:49.701
that the wait was like four months.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.023
Got discharged before
I even got an appointment.

08:54.506 --> 08:57.730
- Hey, Neela.
- Hey. I'm just on my way home.

08:57.777 --> 08:59.910
- Long night.
- Yeah, well...

09:00.106 --> 09:02.441
nobody ever told you
to become a surgeon, right?

09:02.886 --> 09:06.433
Well, actually, yes, they did,
a number of people.

09:07.405 --> 09:10.813
Listen, this-this whole thing is weird
to me. I don't know how to do this.

09:10.936 --> 09:12.171
What? Break up?

09:12.207 --> 09:16.630
Yeah. Uh, you know, I know it's probably
over, and... and I deserve it, but

09:16.675 --> 09:20.442
I just wanted to know if we could still be
friends? Can I call you tonight just to talk?

09:20.818 --> 09:24.103
Well, I might go to this rally.
I kind of feel like I should.

09:24.287 --> 09:25.240
Gates!

09:25.487 --> 09:27.492
Your Mr. Pollard stopped breathing!

09:27.518 --> 09:29.842
Uh, he's just holding his breath.
He does that for attention.

09:29.877 --> 09:32.172
He was holding breath for ten minutes.

09:33.658 --> 09:35.632
All right, I'll-I'll try
to get a hold of you tomorrow?

09:35.658 --> 09:37.003
Yeah, sure.

09:54.916 --> 09:57.252
Can you wiggle your fingers?

09:58.576 --> 10:01.583
Hey, Dawn, can I get some Bacitracin
and some sterile gauze, please?

10:01.956 --> 10:03.423
Take it easy, sir.

10:03.608 --> 10:06.221
Well, it looks like
your brother-in-law's waking up.

10:06.438 --> 10:08.671
- Can I talk to him now?
- What the hell?

10:08.707 --> 10:11.162
Just relax, sir. You're in County
Hospital. You had a little fall,

10:11.207 --> 10:13.020
but you're doing okay now.

10:13.778 --> 10:16.481
- Yeah, I just need a minute with him.
- Go ahead.

10:17.046 --> 10:18.450
In private.

10:19.095 --> 10:21.770
All right, make it quick.
I'll be right back.

10:24.696 --> 10:26.622
Hey. Hey! Hey!
What's he doing here?

10:26.638 --> 10:28.741
Oh, oh, oh. No, no, no.
Whoa. I can explain.

10:28.776 --> 10:30.720
- No. Somebody call the cops.
- He's... No.

10:30.775 --> 10:33.113
- This is not what you think. He...
- All right, Mr. Saltzman,

10:33.147 --> 10:36.301
your brother-in-law accidentally landed
on you when you two fell off the roof.

10:36.328 --> 10:37.560
What roof?

10:37.746 --> 10:41.150
He's not my brother-in-law.
He's got a woman tied up in his apartment.

10:41.175 --> 10:43.812
- I heard her screaming.
- No, no, no, no, no, I can explain.

10:43.837 --> 10:46.441
- He beat me up when I tried to rescue her.
- I think you might have to explain it to the cops.

10:46.477 --> 10:48.411
That lady you and Gates worked up--
gave her two liters of saline,

10:48.448 --> 10:51.053
- her pressure's down to 90/65.
- Oh, crap.

10:51.678 --> 10:53.153
Well? I'm listening.

10:54.167 --> 10:57.593
Okay, are you familiar with RACK?

10:58.077 --> 11:00.651
Risk Aware Consensual Kink?

11:07.718 --> 11:09.010
No.

11:09.288 --> 11:11.290
I really need something for the pain.

11:11.516 --> 11:14.251
Well, we gave you a nerve block.
It should have kicked in by now.

11:14.278 --> 11:16.473
Well, it didn't.
It's killing me.

11:16.976 --> 11:21.141
You know why they named the largest military
hospital in the world after Walter Reed?

11:21.175 --> 11:22.171
No.

11:22.275 --> 11:26.102
Yellow fever was wiping out the troops
during the Spanish-American War,

11:26.128 --> 11:28.360
and Walter Reed was
the one who discovered

11:28.376 --> 11:31.911
that the disease was being
transmitted by mosquitoes.

11:32.127 --> 11:37.173
And he greatly reduced infection
with aggressive insect control.

11:37.326 --> 11:40.733
Of course, everybody ended up dying
of cancer from the pesticides, but...

11:41.035 --> 11:42.482
it was a valiant effort.

11:42.705 --> 11:44.983
Excuse us. Can I talk to you
for a second, Morris?

11:48.925 --> 11:51.730
Maybe the injection didn't
get into the sheath.

11:52.186 --> 11:55.971
I drew blood from his hand
with a needle, he didn't even flinch.

11:56.087 --> 11:59.483
- He's a soldier.
- No. He's lying. He can't feel his arm.

11:59.545 --> 12:02.320
- There's no problem with the nerve block.
- You think he's faking?

12:02.348 --> 12:04.891
I think he's either drug-seeking
or he has issues.

12:05.116 --> 12:08.483
- I'll call psych.
- No, no, not here, at the V.A.

12:08.758 --> 12:11.030
They have better continuity of care,
and they have a good support system

12:11.047 --> 12:12.990
- for returning vets.
- It could be months before he gets an appointment.

12:13.018 --> 12:14.602
They're overwhelmed.

12:14.905 --> 12:18.182
Then do a hospital-to-hospital transfer.
They'll have to take him today.

12:18.367 --> 12:20.061
Belly's still benign.

12:20.276 --> 12:23.871
- Could be an occult infection.
- An infection? But I feel so much better.

12:23.887 --> 12:26.330
- Even my nausea's gone.
- Well, with diabetes,

12:26.375 --> 12:29.502
there can often be nerve damage, so
you can develop an abdominal condition

12:29.516 --> 12:32.361
- without feeling any symptoms.
- You think she's septic?

12:32.385 --> 12:35.300
- No fever, no white count.
- Well, can't always count on those.

12:35.346 --> 12:38.592
Let's get two sets of blood
cultures, 3.375 of Zosyn,

12:38.607 --> 12:42.042
start dopamine at five mikes,
CT with IV and oral contrast.

12:42.076 --> 12:45.081
- Got it.
- More tests? Kevin...

12:46.037 --> 12:50.680
Um, you're a bit of a mystery, ma'am,
but we're gonna figure out what's going on.

12:50.956 --> 12:53.143
I came in here to get some medicine
to stop the vomiting.

12:53.175 --> 12:54.613
I've been here for six hours now.

12:54.638 --> 12:57.101
Well, we can't risk sending you
home with a serious condition.

12:57.165 --> 13:01.232
It's not serious.
Do you think it could be serious?

13:02.788 --> 13:07.633
Well, I've seen a lot of doctors in here,
but if you think it could be serious,

13:07.766 --> 13:09.733
you're the touchstone, Kevin.

13:11.545 --> 13:12.480
Okay.

13:13.005 --> 13:15.791
We're going to get started on these
right away for you, Mrs. Calder.

13:17.305 --> 13:20.943
- You're on top of this, Doctor.
- Touchstone? What's that all about?

13:21.107 --> 13:23.833
It's a black siliceous mineral used to test the purity of gold.

13:23.847 --> 13:25.963
- The miners used to take the metal...
- Yes, I know what it means.

13:25.975 --> 13:28.310
Well, then you should, you know,
take it as a compliment.

13:28.346 --> 13:30.792
- You might turn out to be gold.
- Fool's gold.

13:30.837 --> 13:33.732
Yeah, pyrite. But only an expert
can tell the difference.

13:34.078 --> 13:36.743
- Who is your boy friend?
-  Um, his name is Paxton...

13:36.876 --> 13:40.620
he came in with his brother-in-law,
I think.

13:42.545 --> 13:45.921
- And his name is...?
- You know what? I got this, Frank.

13:46.148 --> 13:48.341
- Okay.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

13:48.476 --> 13:50.743
Hillary Milbauer.
So you saw my boyfriend?

13:50.777 --> 13:55.283
I did. And you're... you're
the woman that was tied up?

13:57.565 --> 13:59.202
And gagged and screaming.

13:59.527 --> 14:01.873
- That's me.
- Right, okay.

14:02.077 --> 14:04.781
I told you, I was just trying to defend myself.

14:04.807 --> 14:06.891
Then why didn't you call the cops?

14:07.818 --> 14:10.371
Because I'm not supposed to be running
a business out of my apartment.

14:10.406 --> 14:13.531
- That's her! That's his victim!
- That is my girlfriend.

14:13.558 --> 14:16.062
- All right, Abby, what's going on?
- This is Hillary Milbauer.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.670
Apparently, these two operate
an adult Web site out of their apartment.

14:18.708 --> 14:20.983
Yeah, I already got that part
from Scorsese here.

14:21.207 --> 14:23.812
- He broke in and attacked us.
- You were screaming!

14:23.856 --> 14:26.522
- I was trying to save you.
- I told you, it's just an act.

14:26.555 --> 14:29.161
It's like erotic performance art.

14:29.705 --> 14:33.400
Um, do you think it's possible you
misinterpreted the situation, Mr. Saltzman?

14:33.436 --> 14:36.482
I know what I saw.
What he was doing to her was unnatural.

14:36.696 --> 14:39.330
Unsanitary.

14:41.485 --> 14:44.333
It's still throbbing, dude.
You got to give me something for the pain.

14:44.407 --> 14:47.473
We're transferring you to the V.A.
Someone there will see you today.

14:47.488 --> 14:49.932
I'm going to recommend you
speak with a psychiatrist.

14:49.946 --> 14:52.673
You think this is all in my head?
Is that what you think?

14:52.706 --> 14:55.331
Hey, I can't get her finger out without
tearing it apart. Can you help me?

14:55.377 --> 14:58.051
- Yeah. I'll be right back.
- Why am I being punished?!

14:58.108 --> 15:00.102
It's real, okay?!
The pain's real!

15:00.126 --> 15:03.902
- Vivian here loads her own shotgun shells.
- My father taught me years ago.

15:03.916 --> 15:06.050
He used to pay me a penny a shell.

15:06.107 --> 15:09.963
- Now I sell custom loads on the Internet.
- I love this country.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.960
- See, it's wedged in there, right?
- Got to get this skin out of the spring.

15:12.976 --> 15:15.020
Tried to open it.
I'm trying to get the...

15:15.077 --> 15:16.113
Look.

15:16.486 --> 15:19.013
Kyle?

15:19.446 --> 15:20.501
Hang on.

15:20.688 --> 15:22.791
Kyle, you need to stay in bed.

15:24.385 --> 15:25.841
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

15:26.455 --> 15:27.230
Kyle!

15:27.668 --> 15:30.052
Kyle, open...!
Open the door.

15:30.306 --> 15:31.143
Can you open it?

15:31.176 --> 15:33.752
- He took my swipe card.
- Find another one. Security!

15:33.775 --> 15:35.551
Kyle, Kyle, don't do this.
Come on, man.

15:35.578 --> 15:37.460
- Come on, stop!
- Leave me alone, man!

15:37.486 --> 15:39.730
Kyle, open this door!
Open it!

15:39.746 --> 15:42.680
- We'll get you something for the pain!
- Come on, don't!

15:42.795 --> 15:45.673
Security! Kyle, stop!
Please, come on!

15:45.775 --> 15:47.221
Kyle, stop!

16:50.515 --> 16:52.532
Sam, where the hell's that key?!

16:52.706 --> 16:55.501
Move away from the door, sir!
Please, move away!

16:55.657 --> 16:57.032
Move away from the door!

16:57.275 --> 16:59.152
- Kyle! Move, move, move.
- Watch your head.

16:59.295 --> 17:01.081
Come on.
All right, spit it out! Spit it out!

17:01.116 --> 17:03.711
- What'd he take?
- You name it, he took it.

17:03.737 --> 17:05.432
Set up to lavage.
Let's go!

17:05.507 --> 17:07.660
No. No! No...!

17:07.885 --> 17:09.991
Kyle! Kyle, calm down!

17:11.396 --> 17:13.161
Monitor, Foley, start a line.

17:13.205 --> 17:16.471
- What labs do you want?
- Acetaminophen and aspirin levels.

17:16.646 --> 17:20.412
No. There's no point in sending that now.
We'll get a four-hour level.

17:20.505 --> 17:23.461
Foley, alkanalize his urine,
and let's put in an Ewald tube.

17:23.505 --> 17:26.400
That's the plan-- just mixing up
nebulized lido for the OG.

17:26.417 --> 17:27.772
No, there's no time for that.

17:28.234 --> 17:30.722
You're going to place an Ewald
without anesthesia?

17:30.906 --> 17:32.782
Thing's like a garden hose.

17:34.205 --> 17:35.641
Hard restraints, please.

17:35.676 --> 17:37.703
Come on, lidocaine neb takes five minutes.

17:37.726 --> 17:39.840
Yeah, which is 12% of gastric transit time.

17:39.876 --> 17:41.571
Do you want him to get 12% poisoned?

17:41.608 --> 17:44.872
You want 12% of the arrhythmias, 12%
of the liver failure? I don't think so.

17:44.906 --> 17:47.640
Not while we still have time
to get the junk out of his stomach.

17:47.836 --> 17:51.451
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- No! Get it away!

17:51.468 --> 17:53.213
- Okay!
- Get it away from me!

17:53.406 --> 17:56.763
Sir, hey, hey! Please, come on,
we're trying to help you.

17:57.378 --> 17:59.131
Would you put a little muscle
into it, please?

18:01.808 --> 18:02.912
All right.

18:03.775 --> 18:06.730
All right, come on, screw the V.A.
This guy needs Fentanyl and Versed.

18:06.747 --> 18:10.533
Nope. The risk of aspiration is too high
when you try to sedate during lavage.

18:10.558 --> 18:12.390
So we'll intubate, we'll protect his airway!

18:12.418 --> 18:14.440
No. The risk is too high;
it's not worth it.

18:14.477 --> 18:17.133
GI bleeder just puked a liter of blood.

18:17.216 --> 18:20.190
Okay. Put the tube in, and lavage until

18:20.228 --> 18:23.622
all the pill fragments come out
and until that fluid runs clear.

18:24.748 --> 18:27.260
Please... please... Please!

18:34.746 --> 18:36.991
They tried to save my legs,

18:37.456 --> 18:43.193
but the... the crush injuries
were too severe.

18:46.238 --> 18:49.101
But it could be a lot worse, you know?
I could be dead.

18:58.426 --> 19:04.542
They're going to fit me for prosthetics
as soon as the flaps IO.

19:08.847 --> 19:11.221
So I guess, in the meantime, I can...

19:12.007 --> 19:16.310
pimp out my wheelchair,
maybe put some flames down the side.

19:16.347 --> 19:20.100
I'll have a whole new
set of legs, a cool van.

19:20.488 --> 19:23.500
- Hey, I can park in the good spaces now.
- Ray, stop.

19:24.808 --> 19:26.622
Uh, do you want something to drink?

19:26.836 --> 19:29.432
- I'm going to get a coffee.
- No, thanks, I'm good.

19:29.666 --> 19:32.441
Um, I'll call your parents,
see if I can get an ETA.

19:33.065 --> 19:35.332
That's... great.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.850
Is there anything I can do?

19:49.145 --> 19:50.103
No.

19:54.316 --> 19:56.092
Would you like me to tell anyone at County?

19:56.116 --> 19:57.290
No.

19:58.775 --> 20:00.772
I really don't want you to do anything.

20:03.326 --> 20:06.453
I was so worried about you.
I even went to our...

20:09.038 --> 20:10.553
...your apartment.

20:16.177 --> 20:18.790
Well, it's up for lease
if you want to move back in.

20:21.377 --> 20:22.661
No ramps.

20:31.506 --> 20:34.013
You know, the night this...

20:37.785 --> 20:39.751
After you left the wedding...

20:41.606 --> 20:43.382
I tried calling you,

20:43.595 --> 20:47.771
- 'cause I wanted to talk. I was hoping...
- I know, I know.

20:51.576 --> 20:53.873
I was checking the message when I got hit.

20:58.937 --> 21:00.212
So I know.

21:05.148 --> 21:06.822
How much bicarb is he getting?

21:06.845 --> 21:11.313
Two amps per liter, quarter normal at 200 per hour.

21:11.335 --> 21:14.843
Okay, check his urine pH.
I don't get it.

21:15.108 --> 21:18.531
- What's going on with this guy?
- Looks like textbook PTSD to me.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.271
No, he never saw combat.
That's what his buddies said;

21:20.287 --> 21:21.941
- he was an interpreter.
- Oh, he saw plenty.

21:21.978 --> 21:24.602
Who do you think translates
during those interrogations?

21:25.476 --> 21:26.950
I seem to have misplaced...

21:27.835 --> 21:29.301
Hello, what's this?

21:30.407 --> 21:33.483
Uh, we had to intubate.

21:34.155 --> 21:36.461
I thought I specifically told you not to.

21:37.218 --> 21:39.951
Maybe I was using my inner voice again.
I know that's a bad habit.

21:40.005 --> 21:42.943
He was losing his gag reflex,
became hypoxic.

21:43.558 --> 21:45.480
I don't see anything about hypoxia here.

21:45.516 --> 21:50.050
Uh, well, it was, you know, hectic.
I haven't had a chance to update the chart.

21:51.057 --> 21:52.512
Do you have any pill fragments?

21:52.737 --> 21:54.902
Yeah, we, uh, we did.

21:55.638 --> 21:56.931
We got this.

21:57.795 --> 21:58.863
Not enough.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.062
Gates, it's Sarah.
She doesn't sound good.

22:05.535 --> 22:07.860
Move away from that, please.
Can I see that?

22:08.386 --> 22:10.852
- Toxic bradycardia.
- We're on it.

22:10.878 --> 22:13.430
Yeah? Are you?
Really? On it?

22:13.537 --> 22:16.180
Because one might argue
that you are in fact underneath it,

22:16.545 --> 22:18.583
that if you hadn't dicked around
so long with the intubation,

22:18.616 --> 22:21.463
you wouldn't be digging your way
out of an overdose right now.

22:23.018 --> 22:25.412
Let me know when you learn to roll over.

22:35.027 --> 22:36.960
Parents coming to take you home?

22:38.276 --> 22:40.592
My mom's been here for a few days.

22:42.545 --> 22:44.510
I've never been to...

22:45.577 --> 22:47.350
Baton Rouge.

22:49.578 --> 22:51.463
Maybe I could come visit you.

22:52.157 --> 22:53.653
Don't.

22:55.225 --> 22:56.392
What?

22:56.876 --> 23:00.813
Just don't tell me you're going to do
something when I know you won't.

23:02.346 --> 23:04.680
Why don't you think I'd come visit you?

23:06.688 --> 23:09.180
Because that's what
our relationship is, Neela.

23:09.867 --> 23:13.980
You give me hope, and I,
like a fool, believe you.

23:14.338 --> 23:16.933
- Ray, that's not true.
- It is true.

23:18.408 --> 23:20.361
I've waited for you...

23:21.826 --> 23:23.481
I trusted you.

23:24.555 --> 23:26.211
I fought for you...

23:27.066 --> 23:29.581
And I even fell in love with you.

23:31.085 --> 23:34.932
But for what? So you could just
keep running back to Gates?

23:35.258 --> 23:38.852
I'm not. That's what I've been
trying to tell you. It's over.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.961
Tony and I are done.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.472
Well, it doesn't really
matter now, does it?

24:03.087 --> 24:06.461
- Yeah, baby, that's good! Don't stop.
- Oh, yeah, you like that, don't you?

24:06.506 --> 24:09.080
Am I a bad girl?
Do you want to spank me?

24:09.107 --> 24:12.460
Yeah. I'm gonna spank you.
You're a bad girl.

24:12.477 --> 24:16.072
- What's going on in here?
- I told you it was too loud. Come here.

24:16.145 --> 24:17.491
What are you guys watching?

24:17.645 --> 24:20.481
Oh, it's a website hosted
by a couple of our patients.

24:21.156 --> 24:24.371
- Does that look consensual to you?
- Oh yeah, that's sensual.

24:24.637 --> 24:27.043
- Consensual.
- What, did you fail anatomy?

24:27.118 --> 24:29.853
You cannot do that with your body
unless you really want to.

24:29.878 --> 24:32.082
- Is that woman in this hospital?
- Abby...

24:32.117 --> 24:34.712
Mrs. Calder's pressure dropped
down to 65 systolic again.

24:34.737 --> 24:36.492
I gave orders for dopamine
over an hour ago.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.941
She maxxed out at 20 mikes.

24:38.007 --> 24:40.153
- She's hypotensive?
- It's impossible.

24:48.608 --> 24:51.412
- Don't stop, baby.
- Yeah, you like that, don't you?

24:51.535 --> 24:52.982
How do you like that,
is that what you want?

24:53.015 --> 24:54.833
Oh, yeah, baby, that's good!

24:55.225 --> 24:57.540
- Don't stop, baby!
- Oh, yeah, you like that don't you?

24:57.575 --> 25:00.860
- Am I a bad girl?
- Oh, yeah you are a very bad girl.

25:00.877 --> 25:04.263
- And I would love to spank you.
- Oh, yeah, girl!

25:06.416 --> 25:08.343
Hi, Dr. Morris, sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

25:08.375 --> 25:10.340
No, you didn't. I was, I was...

25:10.568 --> 25:12.410
looking up something medical.

25:20.405 --> 25:21.622
What's going on?

25:21.897 --> 25:25.003
Sorry, I called you at work.
I don't, I didn't know what else to do.

25:25.015 --> 25:26.160
That's okay.
Where are your grandparents?

25:26.178 --> 25:27.402
They're inside.

25:27.908 --> 25:30.723
- Hey, Jim? What's going on?
- Hey, Tony.

25:30.777 --> 25:33.192
We're taking Sarah
this weekend, remember?

25:33.907 --> 25:36.760
Yeah. So, uh, what's with all the boxes?

25:38.936 --> 25:42.401
Helen and I think it would be best for
Sarah to spend the summer with us.

25:42.425 --> 25:44.003
Really, that's,
that's what you think, huh?

25:44.038 --> 25:45.493
Shouldn't that be something
we should talk about that?

25:45.516 --> 25:51.293
- I never said I wanted to go.
- Sarah, you love staying with us, huh?

25:51.635 --> 25:53.752
This isn't helping.
We're trying to make it easy for her.

25:53.777 --> 25:55.270
Oh, you think this is easy?

25:55.318 --> 25:57.513
- Jim?
- It's okay.

25:58.177 --> 25:59.682
She doesn't want to go.
She clearly doesn't want to go...

25:59.708 --> 26:02.221
- We appreciate everything...
- Let me handle this, Hellen.

26:02.317 --> 26:04.861
You know what, no--
she's not going with you this weekend.

26:05.058 --> 26:08.113
- Yes, Tony, she is.
- You can't make me!

26:08.145 --> 26:09.422
What's this?

26:10.058 --> 26:12.860
It's an emergency court
order for custody.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.831
We heard you hired a lawyer.

26:17.067 --> 26:18.521
I'm calling the police.

26:19.198 --> 26:20.990
All right, let's mix up Levophed.

26:21.177 --> 26:24.441
Radiology's reading the CT right now.
Why don't you run in another liter.

26:24.675 --> 26:28.081
- Is she bleeding?
- Uh, repeat crit's 38, stable.

26:28.326 --> 26:30.781
- Could it be anaphylaxis?
- No. No new food or drugs.

26:30.818 --> 26:33.532
- And she doesn't have any skin lesions.
- Let's do early goal directed therapy.

26:33.548 --> 26:37.052
She needs a central line
with an 02 sat monitor.

26:37.188 --> 26:39.431
Is there anything else that we could be doing?

26:40.885 --> 26:42.732
- Dr. Moretti?
- I'll be right back.

26:42.757 --> 26:44.720
Hey, you know we could use some help in here.

26:44.908 --> 26:46.583
Man, that guy's a real weirdo.

26:46.778 --> 26:48.893
- Levophed's up.
- Okay, thanks a lot.

26:48.915 --> 26:52.271
No intra-abdominal pathology
whatsoever on CT.

26:52.307 --> 26:53.503
- No abscess?
- Nope.

26:53.525 --> 26:55.242
- Diverticulitis?
- Nothing.

26:55.285 --> 26:57.281
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know maybe it's an infection

26:57.305 --> 26:59.723
from another source?
Urine? CSF?

26:59.788 --> 27:02.580
Her pressure's not moving, and her sats
are dropping. Do you want to intubate?

27:02.615 --> 27:04.961
Yeah, I'll tube her;
Abby, you do the central line.

27:06.395 --> 27:08.663
Hey, Mrs. Calder.
Hang in there, okay?

27:08.715 --> 27:11.330
- One percent lidocaine.
- 20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

27:11.356 --> 27:13.543
- I'd wait on that if I were you.
- Let's get the suction on high,

27:13.578 --> 27:15.023
somebody check the cuff.

27:19.637 --> 27:21.633
Pressure is up to 110 over 70.

27:28.235 --> 27:30.731
- Am I dying?
- Not anymore.

27:31.366 --> 27:34.802
- So what'd you give her? Epi?
- No, please, that would be too easy.

27:34.838 --> 27:37.890
- What'd you inject?
- You tell me.

27:45.677 --> 27:47.802
Mr. and Mrs. Riley have legal custody of the girl.

27:47.815 --> 27:49.861
Oh, come on. That's crap.
I've raised her since she was this big.

27:49.907 --> 27:51.793
- She's practically my own kid.
- Technically, she's not,

27:51.818 --> 27:53.322
and they're the next-of-kin.

27:53.725 --> 27:55.110
She doesn't want to go.
Go ask her,

27:55.135 --> 27:57.851
- ask her if she wants to go.
- I'm afraid she doesn't have a choice.

27:57.875 --> 28:00.323
All right, you know what, let's just...
settle down, all right?

28:00.356 --> 28:02.251
- We'll handle this like adults.
- Hold on.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.781
- This is getting way out of hand, guys.
- Settle down, sir.

28:07.317 --> 28:09.141
So you're just gonna let them take her?

28:09.175 --> 28:11.531
I suggest you get yourself a lawyer
and try to work something out.

28:11.545 --> 28:12.871
I have a lawyer.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.951
Can I at least go say good-bye to her?

28:21.975 --> 28:23.290
- Please?
- Yeah.

28:41.036 --> 28:44.070
Look... it's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

28:44.117 --> 28:48.291
- Don't let them do this.
- It's okay, all right? I'll make sure it's okay.

28:48.756 --> 28:51.322
Look, it's not going to be for that long.
You'll go, you'll have fun.

28:51.375 --> 28:53.342
You know, you'll ride
the horses, it'll be good.

28:53.377 --> 28:56.563
I don't care about the stupid horses!
I don't want to go!

28:56.607 --> 28:59.381
I'll come visit you. I'll come visit you
this weekend, I promise.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.700
This is not permanent, okay?

29:01.948 --> 29:04.331
Look at me. Look at me.

29:05.456 --> 29:09.202
You know I love you. I love you more
than anything in this entire world, right?

29:09.718 --> 29:10.723
Right?

29:11.055 --> 29:13.491
Okay, so I need you to be strong for me.

29:13.687 --> 29:17.273
I need you to go with your grandparents
but you have to trust me, okay?

29:17.677 --> 29:20.472
All right, and it's not be
for a long time, I promise.

29:20.608 --> 29:21.812
I promise you.

29:24.657 --> 29:26.591
I love you, baby girl.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.670
Did you figure it out yet, Pratt?

29:35.857 --> 29:38.422
- Huh?
- What I gave to Mrs. Calder?

29:38.778 --> 29:40.761
Come on, think, think, think,
think, think, think.

29:40.776 --> 29:44.013
Where is that intern?
The one with the temper problem?

29:44.045 --> 29:47.012
- The who started all this...
- Oh, you mean Gates? He had to go.

29:47.407 --> 29:50.243
- Go?
- Yeah, family emergency.

29:51.856 --> 29:55.031
Well, he caused an emergency here.
He was the primary caregiver,

29:55.057 --> 29:56.931
and he dropped the ball
on that patient from the get-go.

29:56.975 --> 30:00.023
Come on, it was a tough call.
There's enough blame to go around.

30:00.337 --> 30:02.012
Backing up your interns?
That's good.

30:02.048 --> 30:04.491
Shows leadership and maturity
which, based on your record,

30:04.517 --> 30:06.843
I didn't think you were capable of.
Bravo, Pratt.

30:07.038 --> 30:08.562
- Thanks.
- Yep.

30:08.748 --> 30:10.831
And as for blame, you're right.
There is plenty to go around

30:10.857 --> 30:13.681
all the way up to the attending level.
That's why I called a staff meeting.

30:13.717 --> 30:16.960
Look, it wasn't perfect, but she's okay.
She got good care.

30:17.616 --> 30:19.430
The hell she did.

30:22.718 --> 30:26.592
Let me ask you something.
I mean, what's going on with you?

30:26.955 --> 30:30.663
I mean, you stand around all day
like some strange Peeping Tom.

30:30.718 --> 30:34.743
Now, all of a sudden you're the king of
the ER.  This is our department, Moretti.

30:34.778 --> 30:37.643
And I don't care how long you've been
a doctor, you haven't been here,

30:37.728 --> 30:39.761
and you haven't worked with all of us.

30:40.158 --> 30:44.673
Gee, I am so sorry that I skipped
my daily dose of testosterone.

30:44.965 --> 30:48.131
We do the best we can
with limited resources.

30:48.407 --> 30:50.671
No, you know, see,
that's where you're wrong.

30:50.777 --> 30:53.063
It is not the resources that are limited--

30:53.108 --> 30:56.551
it is the minds of the people
working on the floor.

31:00.646 --> 31:02.323
Hydrocortisone.

31:03.306 --> 31:05.002
That's what you gave her.

31:05.265 --> 31:07.860
I would have gotten there if you'd
given me another minute or so.

31:22.657 --> 31:23.702
Neela.

31:24.067 --> 31:26.590
This is Jacy, Ray's mom.

31:28.995 --> 31:31.371
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, no, I...

31:31.647 --> 31:35.521
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Ray and I are good friends.

31:36.146 --> 31:39.162
He said you were the best
roommate he ever had.

31:39.658 --> 31:42.682
Well, that's 'cause I did
all his laundry for him.

31:44.248 --> 31:48.061
I used to think sometimes
that was the only reason he came home.

31:54.446 --> 31:57.110
I'm, um, going to take him home now.

31:57.277 --> 31:58.600
Gonna...

31:59.905 --> 32:01.821
I'm going to get him better.

32:10.006 --> 32:12.682
You'll get through this, I promise.

32:22.877 --> 32:26.890
Thank you, Katey.
You've been wonderful.

32:28.665 --> 32:31.842
You come on down to Baton Rouge
whenever you can get away.

32:32.007 --> 32:35.271
- You know I will, ma'am.
- Okay.

32:44.047 --> 32:46.880
- You're a good person, Katey.
- Shut up!

32:47.007 --> 32:49.200
- Shut up!
- Well, I know you're upset...

32:49.237 --> 32:51.540
You did this, you selfish bitch.

32:51.767 --> 32:55.533
Nobody else, okay?
You did. So live with that.

33:06.675 --> 33:09.570
Okay, you're going to be
a little hoarse for a while.

33:09.858 --> 33:11.160
Yeah.

33:15.917 --> 33:18.270
This is going to help you
breathe a little easier.

33:19.985 --> 33:22.221
You want to tell me why you did this?

33:24.215 --> 33:27.251
Kyle, obviously you're hurting,
man, let me help you.

33:31.295 --> 33:32.890
You were...

33:33.157 --> 33:36.511
you were shouting in Arabic
when we were trying to help you.

33:36.547 --> 33:40.152
Something, something about med...

33:46.607 --> 33:48.221
What does that mean?

33:49.218 --> 33:52.921
"Please, don't hurt me.
"I've done nothing wrong.

33:54.155 --> 33:56.003
God have mercy."

33:57.296 --> 34:02.613
I must have translated it a million
times in Iraq. Not that it mattered.

34:03.298 --> 34:06.440
They didn't listen to me any more
than they listened to prisoners.

34:09.507 --> 34:13.032
- Who didn't listen to you?
- The interrogators.

34:18.607 --> 34:20.761
You saw them beat the prisoners?

34:21.717 --> 34:26.270
Beat, burn, other things...

34:27.687 --> 34:29.860
You... you mean torture?

34:30.505 --> 34:33.630
Most of the men they questioned
didn't even know anything.

34:35.126 --> 34:37.081
They were innocent.

34:37.835 --> 34:41.822
I tried to convince the interrogators,
but they didn't believed me.

34:43.156 --> 34:45.501
So they just kept hurting them.

34:46.996 --> 34:50.023
And I just kept translating their cries.

34:50.335 --> 34:53.523
It's not your fault.
We're going to get you some help.

34:54.907 --> 34:57.450
I don't want to go back
to the V.A., man.

34:57.638 --> 34:59.023
You're not.

34:59.475 --> 35:00.721
Not right now.

35:01.398 --> 35:03.870
You're going to stay with us
for a while, okay?

35:04.055 --> 35:05.122
Okay.

36:21.287 --> 36:23.920
Hi, this is Neela, I'm not here
to take your call at the moment,

36:24.005 --> 36:26.380
but you can leave
your message after the tone.

36:36.387 --> 36:38.053
Forgot about this thing.

36:38.847 --> 36:40.431
Might take a while.

36:44.476 --> 36:46.462
Uh, I'll get out here.

36:55.208 --> 36:57.850
Look around and what do you see?

36:58.085 --> 37:01.760
I see faces of every different color,
men and women,

37:01.806 --> 37:07.551
young and old, rich and poor and yet
we all share something in common.

37:07.608 --> 37:10.182
We're all here today
for the same reason.

37:10.656 --> 37:12.620
We love our country!

37:12.838 --> 37:15.280
We might have gotten
here in different ways.

37:15.547 --> 37:20.650
Through a family member or a loved one,
through serving in Iraq,

37:21.218 --> 37:26.453
through an evolving sense not only of
right and wrong, but also the division

37:26.475 --> 37:30.941
between what is justified
and what can never be explained.

37:36.536 --> 37:38.231
Let's begin at the beginning.

37:39.218 --> 37:40.382
Triage.

37:41.657 --> 37:46.932
Three-hour wait for vitals,
eight to 12-hour wait for a bed.

37:47.028 --> 37:49.460
Well, we push them
through as fast as we can.

37:49.638 --> 37:52.231
Well, we almost pushed
Esther Calder six feet under,

37:52.277 --> 37:56.241
but a combination of blind faith,
dumb luck, her resilience

37:56.278 --> 38:01.523
and my attention to detail thwarted
all the attempts that we made to kill her.

38:02.066 --> 38:04.772
I triaged her.
She did not wait very long.

38:04.837 --> 38:08.400
She waited two hours
with intense nausea.

38:08.596 --> 38:11.693
Then after that, another two hours
before she got back to a bed.

38:11.727 --> 38:15.353
And then after that, another hour
before a doctor saw her.

38:15.406 --> 38:17.823
So, what's that, like five hours?
That's not so bad.

38:18.398 --> 38:20.842
It can be better.
It will be better.

38:21.655 --> 38:24.392
What if the triage nurse
had standing orders

38:24.587 --> 38:27.793
for labs and IV fluids and anti-emetics

38:27.978 --> 38:30.372
with a patient like this?
What would happen?

38:30.417 --> 38:33.532
The very charming Mrs. Calder
would be brought right back,

38:33.575 --> 38:37.673
she would get relief,
she would registered at her bedside.

38:37.705 --> 38:39.972
We would knock four hours off
her stay time,

38:40.007 --> 38:42.992
and we would be on top of her problems
before she crashed.

38:43.035 --> 38:45.162
That is a wonderful theory.

38:45.746 --> 38:50.131
- You're taking this personally, Sam.
- Yeah, I'm a nurse, I do triage.

38:50.375 --> 38:53.011
Yeah, I take it personally
when you criticize the job I'm doing.

38:53.068 --> 38:57.091
Good. Okay, good.
I'd be worried about you if you didn't.

38:57.138 --> 38:59.393
Now, the interns.

38:59.898 --> 39:05.801
The peripatetic Dr. Gates
did an inadequate history.

39:06.035 --> 39:09.003
He ordered tests
without consulting an attending.

39:09.037 --> 39:11.263
It was busy.
That's not unusual.

39:11.376 --> 39:15.003
See again, you're arguing that incompetence
and sloppiness are the norm,

39:15.075 --> 39:16.921
and that's no way to impress me.

39:17.056 --> 39:20.570
The resident-- Abby, right?

39:21.238 --> 39:24.551
You assumed that Gates had done
a thorough H and P, and he had not.

39:24.578 --> 39:26.183
It looked like gastroenteritis.

39:26.208 --> 39:30.792
Based on the incomplete H and P which
he took and you accepted at face value.

39:30.816 --> 39:32.940
Your intern led you down
the primrose path.

39:32.977 --> 39:35.312
You sold that to the attending Dr. Pratt,

39:35.405 --> 39:37.700
and then the three of you blithely

39:37.876 --> 39:41.870
walked Mrs. Calder right along
with you to death's door.

39:41.896 --> 39:45.452
- Oh, come on.
- Sepsis was a viable diagnosis.

39:45.726 --> 39:47.652
- Viable?
- Yeah.

39:47.708 --> 39:49.432
Viable?

39:50.666 --> 39:55.280
Nobody took a decent history!

39:57.176 --> 39:58.231
Fact:

39:58.277 --> 40:03.232
80 percent of all diagnoses can be
made on the basis of history alone.

40:03.608 --> 40:06.433
But nobody bothered
to talk to the patient.

40:06.638 --> 40:09.013
You knew what meds she was on
now, that's the easy part,

40:09.046 --> 40:10.782
but what meds was she on a month ago?

40:10.836 --> 40:12.301
One month ago...

40:12.527 --> 40:17.102
she did a two-week course of high-dose
prednisone for URI-associated bronchospasm.

40:17.135 --> 40:21.621
The steroids suppressed her adrenal
glands. She had adrenal insufficiency.

40:21.637 --> 40:24.920
Yes, fine, but that's a pretty rare
condition. We don't see it that often.

40:24.947 --> 40:26.213
No, you see it.

40:26.397 --> 40:28.792
- You just don't recognize it.
- All right, we get the point.

40:28.837 --> 40:30.330
You want us to be more careful.

40:30.345 --> 40:33.720
No, that's a very reductive version
of what I want. What I want is

40:33.745 --> 40:37.262
for us to live in mortal fear
of doing something wrong,

40:37.305 --> 40:41.161
of missing something and having
somebody else pay the price for that.

40:42.685 --> 40:46.612
And I want us to use that fear
to make us better.

40:47.605 --> 40:50.001
I am not here because I need the work.

40:50.626 --> 40:52.923
I'm here because I want
to save the world.

40:53.015 --> 40:54.881
And the way were going to do
it is we're going to reinvent

40:54.975 --> 40:57.533
the way we practice medicine every day.

40:57.576 --> 41:00.350
Right now, right here, on the front.

41:00.576 --> 41:02.913
I have another shift to start, so go.

41:18.378 --> 41:20.500
I've worked here
for a long time, and uh...

41:20.518 --> 41:25.382
you might think that this is the way
to motivate people, but it's not.

41:26.438 --> 41:27.932
Thank you for your input.

41:29.315 --> 41:32.091
- Yeah, listen, all I'm saying is...
- I know; I said thank you.

41:35.557 --> 41:37.570
I think that all of you are just going
to have to take a little time

41:37.617 --> 41:40.090
to get used to my management style.

41:44.487 --> 41:46.633
And you in particular, are going
to have to take a little time

41:46.678 --> 41:49.863
to get used to working with a chief
that you're not sleeping with.

41:59.545 --> 42:01.082
It's not political.

42:01.296 --> 42:07.753
It's not about Republican or Democrat.
It's about young lives lost every day.

42:07.966 --> 42:10.160
Every day.

42:10.818 --> 42:13.323
And knowing when to say,
"We've done what we could,

42:13.358 --> 42:15.791
"and maybe it's time for us to go home.

42:16.097 --> 42:18.930
Let those people sort this
out for themselves."

42:19.918 --> 42:22.032
That's what my brother came to think eventually.

42:22.076 --> 42:25.261
- Stay the course! Finish the job!
- After being over there two years

42:25.348 --> 42:28.942
and seeing what was going on,
seeing what the results were...

42:29.178 --> 42:31.641
- Get off the stage!
- Unfortunately, the letter in wich...

42:31.676 --> 42:35.861
he expressed that was written the night
before he got killed by a sniper's bullet...

42:57.336 --> 43:02.530
