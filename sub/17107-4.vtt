OK, so I'm eternally grateful
I scored a fill in role with

I'd find helpful?

One of those training montages

in entertaining, bite-size
chunks.

Suddenly, time's passed and

wishing my life away, but if

12:39.600 --> 12:41.279
much for you.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.039
-Thanks.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.480
These people aren't
even trained.

12:44.519 --> 12:46.600
That guy's still wearing
his pajamas.

12:46.639 --> 12:47.399
-Don't point.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.759
That's his trademark.

12:48.799 --> 12:51.600
Commercial dance is all about
bringing your own thing.

12:51.639 --> 12:54.759
-Well, my thing is 15 years
of formal ballet training.

12:54.799 --> 12:56.159
OK if I bring that?

13:00.559 --> 13:02.480
-OK, guys, you ready?

13:02.519 --> 13:03.080
-Yeah.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.399
-[singing]

13:04.440 --> 13:06.399
You wanna ooze, and clip it,
and don't forget the--

13:06.440 --> 13:07.799
ALL: --free dance!

13:07.840 --> 13:11.639
-One, two, three, four, and
five, here we go, and one,

13:11.679 --> 13:14.519
two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

13:14.559 --> 13:17.240
And a one, two, three,
four, and five, and

13:17.279 --> 13:18.720
six, and seven, eight.

13:18.759 --> 13:22.639
And a one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, and a

13:22.679 --> 13:26.320
one, two, three and four, and
five and six and seven eight.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.159
Two, four, five and six,
and seven, eight.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.360
And a one, two, three, four,
five, and six, and seven--

13:33.399 --> 13:35.480
aagh, I see we've got a
ballerina in our midst.

13:35.519 --> 13:38.200
Off the back, Ballerina.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.120
OK, and five, and six, and
seven, eight, and a one, two,

13:42.159 --> 13:44.480
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

13:44.519 --> 13:47.840
One, two, three, four, five,
and cut it loose.

14:00.679 --> 14:01.799
-And those leaps.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.399
A totally different
experience.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.159
I've never partnered
like that ever.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.720
-Some dancers just click.

14:06.759 --> 14:08.200
I had a suspicion we might.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.679
-Why?

14:09.720 --> 14:11.519
I'm a third year wannabe, and
you-- you're Saskia Duncan.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.679
-You're not a wannabe, Ben.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.320
You're a student, and
that's a good thing.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.440
You're like brand new clay.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.639
-So you want to mold me?

14:18.679 --> 14:19.399
-Sorry.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.840
That sounds terrible.

14:20.879 --> 14:23.159
It's just finding the perfect
partner can be a lifelong

14:23.200 --> 14:26.320
mission, and they can
come from anywhere.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.200
Some of the ballet greats didn't
become legends until

14:28.240 --> 14:29.399
they found theirs--

14:29.440 --> 14:32.799
Fonteyn, Nureyev, Gelsey
Kirkland, Baryshnikov.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.639
-What, and you think we could be
one of those partnerships?

14:35.679 --> 14:36.279
-No idea.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.200
Who can tell?

14:37.240 --> 14:38.679
Put it this way.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.240
Working with me might
at least fast track

14:40.279 --> 14:41.440
your time in the corps.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.159
-Payback, was it, for leaking
your genius music?

14:57.200 --> 14:59.399
-Ah, and it worked so well.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.840
-Well, thanks for
the dance slap.

15:00.879 --> 15:04.320
I was really craving
another fix.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.399
-You realize your thing isn't 15
years of training anymore?

15:07.440 --> 15:08.000
It's quitting.

15:08.039 --> 15:10.320
You're a quitter.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.320
-[scoffs].

15:11.360 --> 15:13.399
And what's your thing?

15:13.440 --> 15:16.320
Rapping about the ladies wanting
to get with you, even

15:16.360 --> 15:17.480
though-- news flash--

15:17.519 --> 15:18.960
everyone knows you're
into boys.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.799
-No, my thing is to give this
year absolutely everything,

15:21.840 --> 15:23.799
because if I don't, then I'll
just be another middle class

15:23.840 --> 15:26.440
brat who can't do fractions,
and you'll be--

15:26.480 --> 15:28.159
-Yes?

15:28.200 --> 15:30.279
-An uptight ice queen
posing as a slacker.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.759
-Got to get rid of
these knots.

15:39.799 --> 15:42.080
It's not happening with all the
extra work you're doing.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.200
-Doesn't hurt too much.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.600
I just use the heat cream.

15:44.639 --> 15:45.399
-Good.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.480
Keep listening to your body.

15:47.519 --> 15:49.080
Consistent pain, time to stop.

15:54.279 --> 15:58.200
-Also, I wanted to ask you,
I have this friend--

15:58.240 --> 16:00.200
well, more of a friend of a
friend, outside the Academy.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.799
Anyway, she doesn't eat in
public anymore, and then I

16:03.840 --> 16:07.600
think she might eat
a lot secretly.

16:07.639 --> 16:09.360
-Binging?

16:09.399 --> 16:10.799
Does she purge?

16:10.840 --> 16:13.320
Vomit or overexercise?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.200
-I know what you're thinking,
but it's a ballet school.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.440
You have a big lunch, and then
you have to put on a leotard,

16:17.480 --> 16:19.679
and it crosses your mind.

16:19.720 --> 16:22.559
-You think about purging?

16:22.600 --> 16:24.480
-I haven't done it, though, and
I would never, ever do it,

16:24.519 --> 16:29.279
it's just even if she's crossed
that line a few times,

16:29.320 --> 16:31.600
I don't want to make it
a big deal because--

16:31.639 --> 16:34.080
-You want it to go away?

16:34.120 --> 16:35.799
It might.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.200
It might get a lot worse.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.200
-Hi.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.600
We really need to talk.

16:53.639 --> 16:54.399
-Hang on, fresh face.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.279
Nearly done.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.559
-I know what you're doing.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.480
You're sick, and we can't
ignore it any longer.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.159
-Yeah?

17:01.200 --> 17:02.240
I had food poisoning.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.720
It's gone now.

17:06.759 --> 17:07.559
-Stop lying.

17:07.598 --> 17:10.799
You've got bulimia, Kat.

17:10.839 --> 17:14.118
-What do you mean,
I've got it?

17:14.160 --> 17:16.598
What, like I caught it
off a toilet seat?

17:16.640 --> 17:17.759
-It's serious.

17:17.799 --> 17:19.559
You can get stomach ulcers,
lose your teeth.

17:19.598 --> 17:21.799
It damages your immune system.

17:21.839 --> 17:22.598
This isn't you.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.480
You're not this person.

17:23.519 --> 17:24.839
You're smarter than this.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.400
-Right.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.680
Smart enough to know this
isn't about me.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.359
You're jealous.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.640
You're miserable in the company,
completely out of

17:32.680 --> 17:35.200
your depth, and for the first
time ever, I'm not just the

17:35.240 --> 17:36.640
funny sidekick.

17:36.680 --> 17:37.640
I'm fit.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.279
I don't have back issues.

17:39.319 --> 17:40.799
I don't have any issues.

17:40.839 --> 17:42.759
And you can't stand that.

18:02.279 --> 18:05.319
-Looks like Tara's gone the full
cliche and got herself an

18:05.359 --> 18:06.519
eating disorder.

18:06.559 --> 18:08.480
Shame it hasn't helped
drop the kilos.

18:08.519 --> 18:11.559
-Oh, honey, don't feel alone.

18:11.599 --> 18:13.799
Seriously, I used to stealth
puke all over the Academy.

18:13.839 --> 18:15.480
-Seriously, she clogged
so many showers.

18:15.519 --> 18:16.240
-No, no, no.

18:16.279 --> 18:17.319
I'm researching.

18:17.359 --> 18:18.160
It's not me.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.559
-Please.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.799
-Grace, rule number one, no
attitude, just acceptance.

18:22.839 --> 18:25.640
You can't force someone out
of the denial stage.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.400
-Wait, you can't?

18:27.440 --> 18:30.240
-I was so touchy, the girls
were terrified to even use

18:30.279 --> 18:32.559
words like "fat" or "skinny"
around me.

18:32.599 --> 18:34.799
-Remember how I started ordering
full cal smoothies?

18:34.839 --> 18:37.480
-It was so great.

18:37.519 --> 18:40.759
So just know, we're here for
you, babe, unconditionally.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.400
Grace?

18:55.359 --> 18:58.200
-Hey, Evs, how do we feel
about planking?

19:02.599 --> 19:04.599
-Hey, you OK?

19:04.640 --> 19:05.799
-Go away, Christian.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.160
-OK, guys, come on in.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.400
Don't be shy.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.279
We're a judgement-free zone
here of beginners.

19:32.319 --> 19:34.519
I can see some new and--

19:34.559 --> 19:36.640
I can see some familiar
faces here today.

19:42.440 --> 19:50.599
[telephone ringing]

19:50.640 --> 19:52.319
-OK. you know what
you want to do.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.839
You want to ooze it, and clip
it, and don't forget to--

19:55.880 --> 19:56.440
-Bring it!

19:56.480 --> 19:57.680
-Bring it!

19:57.720 --> 19:59.799
Six, seven, eight, and to

-Perfect.

[telephone ringing]

20:23.839 --> 20:24.400
-OK.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.240
Go again.

20:27.279 --> 20:28.599
-Hi?

20:28.640 --> 20:29.519
Hey.

20:29.559 --> 20:30.640
Sorry, it's Kat.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.319
I think she needs you.

20:32.359 --> 20:33.599
-Oh, um, no.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.240
Thanks for letting me know.

[side conversation]

20:42.839 --> 20:44.440
-Excuse me, Sir Jeffrey?

20:44.480 --> 20:45.720
-Hm?

20:45.759 --> 20:48.599
-Um, my back's been twinging,
and Dr. Weeks said

20:48.640 --> 20:50.119
not to overdo it.

20:50.160 --> 20:53.720
-You are not gracing us with
your nasal explosions.

20:53.759 --> 20:54.240
-Sorry.

20:54.279 --> 20:55.079
I--

20:55.119 --> 20:55.799
I should be fine for tomorrow.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.000
-Oh, goodnesss, no.

20:57.039 --> 20:59.759
I wouldn't dream of you
overexerting yourself.

20:59.799 --> 21:01.200
Maria?

21:01.240 --> 21:02.240
Darling, apologies.

21:02.279 --> 21:03.640
You're needed tonight
in the corps.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.000
-Tara, wait up.

21:08.039 --> 21:10.359
Look, you can't bail on a
performance just because I

21:10.400 --> 21:10.799
trained with Saskia.

21:10.839 --> 21:12.240
-I'm not.

21:12.279 --> 21:14.079
-You said it was my call, and
now you're blaming me for

21:14.119 --> 21:16.319
taking up a massive
opportunity.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.039
-Have you stopped to think about
why Saskia wants to help

21:18.079 --> 21:20.359
you, why you out of all of the
dancers in the company?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.839
-Because she thinks I'm good.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.160
-Nothing to do with getting
back at me for

21:23.200 --> 21:24.559
trying to have her fired?

21:24.599 --> 21:28.200
-Look, Saskia sees something
in me, something special.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.279
But you clearly don't, do you?

21:31.319 --> 21:32.480
-Look, I've really got to go.

TARA NARRATING: I guess
shortcuts come

21:36.480 --> 21:37.640
with strings attached.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.400
You might sell your
soul to the devil

21:41.440 --> 21:43.400
without realizing it.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.799
-OK, from the top!

way out of the mud that's
supposed to

21:52.240 --> 21:53.799
make you who you are.

Montages look good in

22:11.160 --> 22:12.319
with a quick fix.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.559
-Kat?

22:28.359 --> 22:32.319
All those horrible things I
said before, what I should

22:32.359 --> 22:36.160
have said was I love you.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.759
It's just scary.

22:37.799 --> 22:39.200
You're Kat.

22:39.240 --> 22:42.319
I hate that you've been going
through this alone.

22:42.359 --> 22:46.359
-Yeah, I'm Kat, the one
who eats her feelings.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.599
It's a big joke, right?

22:51.400 --> 22:55.039
Now no matter how much I eat,
I never feel better.

22:55.079 --> 22:56.640
It's like there's a hole
that I can't fill.

22:59.799 --> 23:01.119
-Sammy-shaped hole?

23:04.480 --> 23:05.640
-Of course.

23:08.759 --> 23:10.079
Maybe it's something
else, too.

23:12.680 --> 23:16.319
Since I got back this
year, it's like I

23:16.359 --> 23:17.519
don't know how to fit.

-We'll work it out, I promise.

will get you there

23:34.640 --> 23:38.559
sooner, but the right might
be a lot bumpier.

23:38.599 --> 23:41.319
-I'm the driver of
