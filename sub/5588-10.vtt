WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:03.669
         I'm starving.

00:03.671 --> 00:04.937
   Any chance that's for me?

00:04.939 --> 00:06.305
       Oh, no.
   It is for mom.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.207
  I'm planning on making
some bad choices tonight,

00:08.209 --> 00:09.842
and I'm gonna need her
      on my side.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.210
              I never realized
               the forethought

00:11.212 --> 00:12.678
              that went into
         being a disappointment.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.546
      Mm.
               Hey!

00:14.548 --> 00:16.382
     Hey!
              Hey, Uncle Mitch.
        What are you doing here?

00:16.384 --> 00:17.716
       What do you mean?

00:17.718 --> 00:20.119
     It's Uncle Mitchell's
       birthday fun day.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.988
      We know!

00:22.990 --> 00:24.456
   Yeah!
                    Yeah!

00:24.458 --> 00:26.358
       We are so excited you are
       finally cashing this in.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.726
            Me too.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.228
            We forgot to get
        Uncle Mitchell a present

00:29.230 --> 00:30.629
          for his last birthday.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.497
 So, we came up with
  this great idea --

00:32.500 --> 00:34.633
a coupon for a fun day
 with the three of us.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.802
         It was perfect
    because it was so sweet

00:36.804 --> 00:38.637
         and we'd never
         have to do it.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.973
         I hope you're ready
    for your first big surprise!

00:40.975 --> 00:42.307
             I am.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.176
        It's a super-fun omelet!

00:44.178 --> 00:45.811
               Aww!
 Uh, yeah!

00:45.813 --> 00:49.214
    And if you were wondering
what is so super-fun about that,

00:49.216 --> 00:51.884
is that it comes with
a -- a side of, uh...

00:51.886 --> 00:54.253
Luke's omelet dance!

00:55.089 --> 00:57.523
          Don't be shy.
You've been practicing all week.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.757
                        Come on.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.993
     Okay. Uh...

01:00.995 --> 01:02.594
♪ It's your birthday ♪

01:02.596 --> 01:04.563
♪ I'm an omelet ♪
               Oh.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.565
          ♪ It's your birthday ♪

01:06.567 --> 01:09.368
            ♪ I'm an omelet,
            it's your birthday ♪

01:09.370 --> 01:11.837
                   This is
             a living nightmare.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.273
Why would he just show
up? Shouldn't he have
given us some notice?

01:14.275 --> 01:15.941
          I kind of remember him
             calling about it,

01:15.943 --> 01:17.443
           but I would've put it
               in my phone --

01:17.445 --> 01:19.545
              oh, there it is.
Of course.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.246
Oh, my God. I'm supposed to be
cat-sitting.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.681
We have to figure out
   something good.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.249
He's the first to call us
    on our birthdays,

01:24.251 --> 01:26.118
and he always gets us
  amazing presents.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.519
    Are you even
  listening to me?

01:27.521 --> 01:29.288
           How long can a cat go
              without eating?

01:29.290 --> 01:32.024
      Haley, he is
the best uncle there is.

01:32.026 --> 01:34.359
   This cannot be
    our present.

01:34.361 --> 01:35.861
     ♪ It's your birthday ♪

01:35.863 --> 01:38.464
        ♪ I'm an omelet,
      it's your birthday ♪

01:38.466 --> 01:40.365
       ♪ I'm an omelet ♪
  I don't know what's happening,
                 but I love it.

            ♪ It's my birthday ♪

01:56.717 --> 01:59.284
     (giggling)

01:59.286 --> 02:01.887
     if you're going to keep
 giggling, I'll do my <i> own</i> nails.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.223
I'm sorry -- it's just funny,
      the juxtaposition.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.959
          I get it -- I'm Asian.
                 Ha ha ha.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.328
        (doorbell rings)
             It's racist, Daddy.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.996
       Sorry.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.832
       Lily, look who it is --
     our lovely Canadian guests.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.101
           Please come in.
     How is everything upstairs?

02:16.103 --> 02:17.669
       It's like a palace
           up there.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.905
  I keep expecting
to run into Gordon Pinsent.
            Ooh.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.774
     I'm sorry.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.676
Is he not a big movie star
        down here?

02:24.678 --> 02:27.513
         No. But thank you
   for Ryan Reynolds. (chuckles)

02:27.515 --> 02:30.182
One little thing -- we're going
     to see the handprints

02:30.184 --> 02:32.284
at the Chinese Theater,
    and I'm worried

02:32.286 --> 02:35.254
it's going to look disrespectful
      if Rob wears shorts.

02:35.256 --> 02:38.090
  Honey, it's 55 degrees out.
  I'm not wearing long pants.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.758
                 You're fine.
               It's Hollywood.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.627
        There'll be people there
             with <i> no</i> pants.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.296
Hi, Lily.
              Lily,
        say hi to Monte.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.597
        Hi.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.301
        I'm...sorry.
        She's never this shy.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.603
        No,<i> we're</i> sorry.
Seems like something scared her.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.974
                   Ohhhh.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.209
                 (chuckles)

02:57.211 --> 02:59.178
        It was adorable.

02:59.180 --> 03:02.447
    Lily was clearly smitten
with that little Canadian Monte.
                       [Mountie]

03:02.449 --> 03:04.716
                Just heard that.
                Delightful.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.519
It was a rite of passage that
I had been looking forward to --

03:07.521 --> 03:09.354
      my daughter's first crush.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.889
And I wanted to be there for her

03:10.891 --> 03:12.891
   in a way
   that no one was there for <i> me.</i>

03:12.893 --> 03:15.561
       Of course, my first crush
       was on a statue

03:15.563 --> 03:18.530
       of a Confederate general
       in front of a courthouse.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.998
That's the same year they put up

03:20.000 --> 03:22.901
   the "Do not climb the statue"
   signs.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.338
         Hey.
   Sorry I'm late.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.640
     Is this shirt okay?
I got another one in the car.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.409
              It's just lunch.
                 Calm down.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.411
              Your boyfriend's
               gonna love it.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.880
       Last summer, Phil and I
     went to Cabo for five days,

03:34.882 --> 03:38.217
and we met Tom and Lisa Delaney,
     and we had so much fun,

03:38.219 --> 03:40.485
       we make sure to see them
     every time they're in town.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.821
Tom's a hugely successful
 investment banker.
                         Yeah.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.657
He does tons of charity work,
 he runs a marathon in 3:24,

03:45.659 --> 03:47.392
     and he flies
 his own helicopter.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.194
              Yeah, and Lisa...

03:49.196 --> 03:51.063
         Yeah,
she is one lucky lady.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.398
           Before they get here,

03:53.400 --> 03:56.001
         can you promise me
    you won't pick up the check?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.236
       Why?

03:57.238 --> 03:58.770
                 Oh, honey,
                I like them,

03:58.772 --> 04:01.273
           but we've seen them
         three times since Cabo.

04:01.275 --> 04:04.042
  Every time, they order
the most expensive stuff.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.278
They are the richest people
         we know --

04:06.280 --> 04:07.846
    thank you --

04:07.848 --> 04:10.616
and yet I have not seen him
 reach for the check once.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.384
               Tom has trouble
             reaching for stuff.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.353
            He hurt his shoulder
            pitching in college.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.721
                 Division 1.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.456
       You feel a need
to pick up the check because

04:17.458 --> 04:19.690
    you're intimidated by him
and you want to prove something.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.793
 That's crazy. I just don't like
   it when the bill sits there.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.061
                It's awkward.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.363
    You can't just
roll over on something

04:24.365 --> 04:25.631
'cause it makes you feel
     uncomfortable.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.766
              Whatever you want.
        Hello, beautiful.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.268
      Ohh!
                  Hi, handsome.

04:29.270 --> 04:32.404
          (both laugh)

04:32.406 --> 04:33.639
         Hey, you two.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.041
                    Hey!
                             Hi!

04:36.043 --> 04:37.976
              Hi!
  Oh, my gosh.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.312
   It is so great
  to see you guys.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.880
             And you.
 Let's get some champagne.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.049
                  Let's do it.
    Mm-hmm.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.786
              Okay, that's it.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.955
         If you hate it so much,
              just tell me.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.923
             Fine.
   Your cologne is horrible.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.892
         You smell like
  a stripper died in a cabin.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.627
           I'm not talking about
                my cologne.

04:55.629 --> 04:59.164
That's why I hang back and wait
    for him to get specific.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.432
                My mustache.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.967
            I've been growing it
                 for weeks,

05:01.969 --> 05:04.269
    and the two of you have been
        conspicuously silent.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.838
It's very dashing.
         What mustache?

05:06.840 --> 05:09.441
Right, Jay. Like I'm supposed to
believe you didn't see it.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.443
          You got me.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.911
   Check you later, Serpico.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.613
(laughing) Serpico!

05:14.615 --> 05:16.315
             You don't even know
                 who that is.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.016
       Jay.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.352
 Where are you going
with your golf clubs?

05:20.354 --> 05:23.021
                 Take a shot
                in the dark.
But we have a playdate.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.523
         Really? We just had one
               last night.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.857
                  Not that
              I'm saying no --

05:25.859 --> 05:28.126
         just quicker turnaround
               than usual.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.828
 A playdate for Joe.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.164
And both parents are coming,
   so you have to be here.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.699
              You've got to be
                 kidding me.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.434
         I mean, it's bad enough
          that these kids today

05:35.436 --> 05:37.302
           have to make a date
        to play with each other.

05:37.304 --> 05:38.870
     They can't go in the street
            and kick a can

05:38.872 --> 05:41.673
        or drool over a friend's
        centerfold of Kim Novak.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.275
    Say something
    I understand.

05:43.277 --> 05:46.178
Why do we all have to sit around
    and watch our kids play?

05:46.180 --> 05:48.213
    Because that's
 what people do now.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.182
And Joe is very excited
       about it.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.850
His first real friend.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.852
                       Gloria...
What's the problem?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.487
I like the mom,
and everybody says

05:55.489 --> 05:57.389
that you and the dad
have a lot in common.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.657
It's going to be fun.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.859
        (doorbell rings)

06:03.030 --> 06:04.296
 Come in, everybody.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.630
                 Hi!

06:05.632 --> 06:08.500
               Gloria, this is
             my husband, Marty.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.001
          Look at you.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.636
       Pretty as a pinup.

06:11.638 --> 06:14.206
 And where's the lucky husband
    I've been hearing about?

06:14.208 --> 06:16.141
 Marty, that's Jay.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.976
           Oh, good.
          You <i> are</i> old.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.645
    (chuckling) I was scared
    they were exaggerating.

06:20.647 --> 06:21.947
           (chuckles)

06:22.683 --> 06:26.852
          Um, so...I don't want
         to spoil any surprises,

06:26.854 --> 06:28.754
                  but, uh,
            if you had to guess,

06:28.756 --> 06:31.523
      what -- what would you say
          we're doing today?

06:31.525 --> 06:34.359
Yeah, let's just see if you pick
      what we have planned.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.328
           Let's see.
          Oh, my God.

06:36.330 --> 06:37.729
   Is it that farm in Oxnard

06:37.731 --> 06:40.098
    where cam and Lily and I
    went strawberry-picking?

06:40.100 --> 06:42.000
             We had
     the most wonderful --

06:42.002 --> 06:43.902
        (tires squeal)
               Ow.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.238
        Sorry, but you are just
         so great at this game.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.273
But it's not strawberry season,
      so it can't be that.

06:48.275 --> 06:52.010
    Which is exactly
why we didn't pick that.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.379
        Okay,
  so...guess again.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.548
            Wait --
     do I smell the ocean?

06:56.550 --> 06:57.849
   Are you taking me to that
fabulous Carlton's on the beach?

06:57.851 --> 06:59.084
     They have the most --

06:59.086 --> 07:00.519
        (tires squeal)
               Ow!

07:00.521 --> 07:02.187
          Well, we're not making
               any promises,

07:02.189 --> 07:04.222
              but that would be
            a pretty good guess.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.758
If they weren't closed
   for renovations.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.727
            Damn it!
     Think, Uncle Mitchell.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.229
It's getting a little
warm in here. Do you mind
if we crack a window?

07:11.231 --> 07:12.898
  Unless I've already
done that with my head.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.933
           (chuckles)
                We -- we need
          to stop for gas, okay?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.768
    Just keep your blindfold on,
           Uncle Mitchell.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.036
             Okay.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.071
             Fine.
         This is fine.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.473
                Fill 'er up!

07:21.475 --> 07:24.109
        (Southern accent)
           Yes, ma'am.
Seriously?

07:29.716 --> 07:30.949
 We can't just keep
   driving around.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.484
    We need to go
      somewhere.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.786
         Focus, people.
 What does Uncle Mitchell like?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.321
       I don't know. Gay things,
       right? What's the gayest
       thing you can think of?

07:36.323 --> 07:37.656
       (scoffs)
 He's married to it.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.057
                 Hey, look.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.728
   Everybody loves stars.
We could take him on a tour.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.130
                Driving around
              looking at houses

07:45.132 --> 07:46.765
                isn't much
          of a birthday fun day.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.366
       We need more time.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.802
      Let's knock him out.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.744
          Charlize Theron,
   Harrison Ford, Halle Berry...

07:59.746 --> 08:01.480
 None of these seem
very Uncle Mitchell.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.515
            What does
      Uncle Mitchell like?
Gay things.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.917
          Then here's
        the mother lode.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.919
              Barbra Streisand!
                   Perfect!

08:07.921 --> 08:10.255
Okay, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. How do we
know these maps are real?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.257
     You think I built this
  whole business on fake maps?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.092
         What business?
You got a sign and a lawn chair.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.462
    Can we wrap this up? I might
      still have a cat to feed.

08:17.464 --> 08:21.800
      Phil must have taken
100 pictures of me on the beach

08:21.802 --> 08:24.803
      just to get one shot
of the topless women behind me.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.638
        There were topless women
               behind you?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.173
         (both laugh)
                      Uh-huh.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.641
Here you go. I'll just take this
       when you're ready.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.877
           Oh, okay.
           Thank you.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.014
So, what do you two have planned
     for the rest of today?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.682
       Nothing...really.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.518
        But if you need
     to wind it up, it's --

08:39.520 --> 08:41.318
  Nah. We're good.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.788
           (chuckles)
               Yeah, good. Good.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.858
      Do you guys, uh, you have
     any fun trips planned or...

08:46.860 --> 08:49.194
   Well, I was planning
on visiting the restroom,

08:49.196 --> 08:51.663
   and if all goes well,
then maybe Spain in April.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.898
                Adios, amigo.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.165
           (laughter)

08:54.167 --> 08:55.734
   iVaya con dios!

08:55.736 --> 08:57.035
           (chuckles)

08:57.037 --> 08:58.970
  You want to keep that hand,
             amigo?

08:58.972 --> 09:00.872
      And France
 was just beautiful.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.908
   MARTY: I hadn't been there
          since D-Day.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.309
            Took me
    the same amount of time

09:04.311 --> 09:05.710
   to get across that beach,
            though.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.978
         (both chuckle)

09:06.980 --> 09:08.179
            You were
        in the service?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.414
                    Yeah,
             but different war.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.815
       Oh, Korea. Me too.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.517
                No, next war.
                 Keep going.

09:12.519 --> 09:15.053
    Anybody want some cheese?
                             Ah.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.489
            Not me.
    Gums up the old ticker.

09:17.491 --> 09:19.324
           (chuckles)
     Jay knows about that.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.592
                   No idea.
               Love the stuff.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.160
   Just be careful
  with the almonds.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.562
    You may break
     the denture.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.330
         Uh, it's not a denture.
             It's an implant.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.932
              How many times
         have we been over this?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.567
       You forget stuff,
           too, huh?

09:28.569 --> 09:30.201
               I never forget
                  anything.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.337
   When we park at the mall,
   we have to take a picture.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.439
 Jay, Gloria tells me you have
kids from your first marriage.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.707
   So does Marty.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.877
             Yeah.
     My oldest is, uh, 66.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.346
              Was.
     She passed last year.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.682
Oh, I'm so sorry.
             Well, that's young.
                What was it?

09:43.684 --> 09:45.717
                Natural causes.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.452
              I blame most of it
              on stress.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.754
       So much more pressure
       than there was years ago.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.022
              Back in <i> our</i> day --

09:51.024 --> 09:52.424
                Different day.
              Not the same day.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.259
             Actually more
       your dead daughter's day.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.927
          May she rest in peace.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.098
Mom, we need to talk.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.434
        What are you doing here?
        You're supposed to be
        watching the kids.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.536
Wesley is a bad influence
         on Joe.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.371
      He's rude
 and disrespectful,

10:06.373 --> 10:08.406
     and I think you should
nip this friendship in the bud.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.241
   He made fun of your mustache,
             didn't he?

10:10.243 --> 10:12.310
What kind of 4-year-old
knows the word "wispy"?

10:12.312 --> 10:13.578
                   (sighs)

10:13.580 --> 10:15.447
             Manny, look at me.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.918
          This close,
  and I still couldn't see it.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.153
            It's just for
    a little while longer, okay?

10:22.155 --> 10:23.822
       Fine.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.858
But if they mess with <i> me,</i>
I'm gonna mess with <i> them.</i>

10:28.996 --> 10:32.097
     How many times a night
 do you have to get up to pee?

10:32.099 --> 10:33.498
    I'm up to four or five.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.734
             Not me, old-timer.
                 Twice tops.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.736
         Once last month,
 I even slept through the night.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.004
               Now, I'm gonna
                refresh this

10:39.006 --> 10:41.039
            'cause I got nothing
               to worry about.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.808
                I'm literally
            in a pissing contest

10:43.810 --> 10:46.044
        with the son of a bitch.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.847
  Why are we eating
 off the good china?

10:48.849 --> 10:50.515
    Because we're having company
             for lunch.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.250
    Who's coming?

10:52.252 --> 10:55.120
       Okay, I invited Monte
   and his family from upstairs.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.522
    What?! Why?!

10:57.524 --> 10:59.924
   Because a daddy can tell when
    his little girl has a crush.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.493
       I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.161
                 Hey, Lily,
            where are you going?

11:03.163 --> 11:04.462
            Look, I want you
        to be able to talk to me

11:04.464 --> 11:05.797
       about this kind of stuff.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.133
         It's completely natural
               and healthy

11:08.135 --> 11:10.135
              to have feelings
                for someone.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.370
          And you know what?
      I think he likes you, too.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.772
             You just have to
         draw him out, you know?

11:13.774 --> 11:15.774
               Flirt a little.
     How?

11:15.776 --> 11:17.609
     Uh, well, you just
     sit down in front of him,

11:17.611 --> 11:19.778
   look him straight in the eye,
   put a big smile on your face,

11:19.780 --> 11:21.479
     and ask him
     some questions,

11:21.481 --> 11:23.948
     like, "So,
     do you have any hobbies?

11:23.950 --> 11:27.118
   Is Canada really as beautiful
   as they say it is?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.454
    Are you a fan of the bacon?"
    (giggles)

11:29.456 --> 11:31.056
Why are you blinking
     like that?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.857
              Well, because
        I'm sending him signals.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.325
              Okay, what else?
                     Oh.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.860
       Definitely compliment him
             on his outfit,

11:35.862 --> 11:37.128
             laugh at his jokes.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.463
       What if
 they aren't funny?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.298
               Oh, honey,
       the cute ones rarely are.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.067
              God doesn't give
              with both hands.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.969
       Okay, do not have
        a heart attack,

11:44.971 --> 11:47.038
     but when you take off
        your blindfold,

11:47.040 --> 11:50.008
      you will be standing
     in front of none other

11:50.010 --> 11:52.510
       than the legendary
          superstar...

11:52.512 --> 11:54.579
   Who?
      ...the one and only...

11:54.581 --> 11:56.915
  Who?
   ...Ms. Barbra Streisand--

11:56.917 --> 11:58.183
     Oh, my!
            ...'s house.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.851
      Ah -- oh.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.486
  Oh, are you serious?
She actually lives here?

12:01.488 --> 12:02.721
                      Yeah.
           Well...

12:02.723 --> 12:03.988
           I can't believe it.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.423
                  Dude, look.
               Her gate is open.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.425
  We should get a picture of you
         in her driveway.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.728
      How awesome of a birthday
     fun day gift would that be?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.429
Okay. You know what?
  Pepper would die.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.398
  He loved "Yentl" so much,
he had a second bar mitzvah.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.333
                             Oh.
Yeah. Okay, let's --
    let's do it.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.601
      Okay, right in front
         of the house.

12:16.603 --> 12:17.869
                    Yeah.
             This is fantastic.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.537
           ♪ Pepper,
       can you hear me? ♪

12:19.539 --> 12:21.673
             ♪ Pepper,
         can you see me? ♪

12:21.675 --> 12:23.675
    ♪ Pepper, I am standing
       in the driveway ♪

12:23.677 --> 12:25.076
                  Excuse me.
               Can I help you?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.745
       Oh, I'm so sorry.
        We were just --

12:26.747 --> 12:28.279
                 Oh, my God.
             You're Ray Liotta.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.615
              Wow.
    He really <i> is</i> a big fan.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.917
          He even knows
    the name of her gardener.
Ah.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.125
                "Goodfellas"?
              "Something Wild"?

12:40.127 --> 12:42.093
             "Field of Dreams"?
"Field of Dreams."

12:42.095 --> 12:43.361
                 Never seen it.
              Okay,
   we're really not that old.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.029
   Look, Ray Liotta
is a very fine actor,

12:45.031 --> 12:47.365
and we have taken up
 enough of his time.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.534
        Stop saying my full name
        like you have to keep
        telling them who I am.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.802
       Well...

12:50.804 --> 12:53.138
 So, wait -- you live
with Barbra Streisand?

12:53.140 --> 12:55.540
            Y-Y-You got the map.
  Yeah.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.710
        She lived here for about
          2 months 15 years ago.
  Oh.

12:58.712 --> 13:01.379
         You think the bastards
       would update these things

13:01.381 --> 13:03.715
          to reflect the current
            movie-star owners.

13:03.717 --> 13:06.050
 Thank you. Come on, kids. We're
very sorry to have bothered you.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.286
    No, no, no. I don't want you
       to leave empty-handed.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.922
                 Come on in
                for a selfie.
Oh. All right.
   Um...

13:10.924 --> 13:12.157
                      Here.
      O-Okay.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.425
      When you see my movies
      later,

13:14.427 --> 13:16.661
  you're gonna realize
  that this is a special moment.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.996
      Come on.
      And "cheeeeese"!

13:17.998 --> 13:19.497
            Cheese!

13:19.499 --> 13:21.399
See? That's an old actor's trick
      for a perfect smile.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.301
   Except you and I are smiling.
      You guys aren't smiling.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.569
            W-What's the matter?

13:24.571 --> 13:26.004
         It's not you,
          Mr. Liotta.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.173
    We just really feel like
     we let our uncle down.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.242
    We were supposed to plan
a special day for his birthday,

13:31.244 --> 13:32.477
     and we totally flaked.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.812
   We're so sorry.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.780
We tried to figure out
  where to take you,

13:35.782 --> 13:38.416
   and we know how much
you love Barbra Streisand.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.451
            You always give us
         the most awesome gifts.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.686
                     We suck.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.987
        Don't say that.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.656
       I kind of figured
    you didn't have anything

13:44.658 --> 13:46.257
      by the second verse
      of the omelet dance.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.826
                    Hey,
           I've had no training.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.028
But then I saw how hard you were
    trying to make me happy,

13:50.030 --> 13:52.797
        and I just love
   hanging out with you guys.

13:52.799 --> 13:55.533
    Plus, I did get to meet
           Ray Lio--

13:55.535 --> 13:56.801
              Ray.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.803
          You're also gonna meet
                  Barbra.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.438
      What? No.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.173
           I've been meaning
      to go by her house anyway.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.842
                  I've got
            a bunch of her mail.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.610
    Oh, you don't
  have to do that.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.512
               No, no, no, no.
             You remind me of --

14:07.514 --> 14:09.547
         of someone that I loved
            when I was a kid.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.849
            I had a funny uncle,
                    too.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.217
       Oh.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.985
                   This is
               so nice of you.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.320
 Well, I must admit,

14:15.322 --> 14:17.021
 I-I have a little bit
of an ulterior motive.

14:17.023 --> 14:21.226
I think Lily has a giant crush
      on your little guy.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.493
  I kind of wanted
   to set them up.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.162
        I know --
I'm a hopeless romantic.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.730
                     Oh!
               That's so cute!

14:25.732 --> 14:28.299
      I remember my first crush.
        It was at summer camp.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.368
          I lived in Toronto,
       and he was from Edmonton,

14:30.370 --> 14:31.836
                  so it was
             very star-crossed.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.972
          Just like
our little Romeo and Juliet.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.807
            He was the first boy
                I ever loved.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.675
                Billy Macklin.
              (inhales sharply)

14:37.677 --> 14:40.311
             God. I haven't
        thought of him in years.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.746
     Do you have
    any hobbies?

14:41.748 --> 14:43.214
                   Well,
           I like rock climbing.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.482
      I collect Pokémon --

14:44.484 --> 14:45.984
I hear Canada's nice.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.318
 Do you like bacon?

14:47.320 --> 14:48.686
Okay, you know what,
  I'm just gonna --

14:48.688 --> 14:50.021
           After that summer,
        things got pretty rough.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.023
                 Dad died,
           Mom started drinking.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.558
             (voice breaking)
         It was a lot to handle.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.261
 I love your shirt.
     Is it new?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.162
        Oh, I think this shirt's
           older than <i> you</i> are.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.764
  Oh! Ha ha ha ha!

14:59.766 --> 15:01.900
   Okay, Lily, can I see you
    in the bedroom, please?

15:01.902 --> 15:05.103
     Older than I am --
oh, Rob, you're killing me!

15:05.105 --> 15:07.071
             Okay,
      we'll be right back.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.406
          And enough.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.242
 What are you doing
     out there?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.011
              What you told me.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.879
                 I think
         it's going pretty good.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.748
        I thought
your crush was on Monte.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.549
   You can't flirt
  with a grown man.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.085
                 But you said --
       No.
It's not appropriate.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.955
          Oh, no! I'm never
    talking to a boy ever again!

15:23.957 --> 15:26.424
Lily, you have nothing
   to be ashamed of.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.360
        If anything,
this is -- this is <i> my</i> fault.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.897
I thought you meant Monte,
    and I confused you.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.132
       (sighs)

15:34.134 --> 15:35.867
  Can I...tell you
  a little secret?

15:35.869 --> 15:37.635
                   No!

15:37.637 --> 15:39.737
Well, when I made a move
   on my first crush,

15:39.739 --> 15:41.239
 it went way worse.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.242
    It was New Year's Eve,
and I went to give him a kiss,

15:44.244 --> 15:46.311
 and my tongue froze
    to his cheek.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.380
             Why did it freeze?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.282
         It was cold,
and he was made out of bronze,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.985
  (voice breaking) and I don't
want to talk about this anymore.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.721
    What are you
       doing?

15:56.723 --> 15:59.324
         Marty said guys our age
           can't do 10 sit-ups.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.759
  I don't remember saying it,
     but it sounds like me.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.728
Jay, may I speak with you
      for a moment?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.196
                 All right.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.266
                  (grunts)

16:08.268 --> 16:09.500
                  Ah, crap!

16:09.502 --> 16:11.469
      Uh, here.
 L-Let me help you.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.737
         Aah!
   I'm going down!

16:12.739 --> 16:14.973
     Aah! Vicky!

16:14.975 --> 16:17.842
          What is wrong with you
                  today?

16:17.844 --> 16:19.243
     I'm sick of
  Marty lumping me

16:19.245 --> 16:20.812
into the same age category
          as him.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.413
   "Guys like us,"
 "Back in our day."

16:22.415 --> 16:23.982
 I'm a Baby Boomer,
   for God's sake.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.850
I know all the words
 to "Light My Fire."

16:25.852 --> 16:27.852
          Jay, you have to stop
        thinking only about you.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.521
  Yeah, I know, I know.
I should think about Joe.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.923
                  No --<i> me!</i>

16:31.925 --> 16:34.025
                 Do you know
              that Vicky and I

16:34.027 --> 16:36.594
          are the oldest moms
       in the class -- by a lot?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.529
       So?

16:38.531 --> 16:39.831
        This might surprise you,

16:39.833 --> 16:41.599
    but aging is also a big deal
             for women.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.101
                I need Vicky
              to be my friend.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.803
         I feel out of place
    around all those young moms.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.805
           And if you don't like
                her husband,

16:47.807 --> 16:49.540
                   maybe
          she'll stop liking <i> me.</i>

16:49.542 --> 16:51.676
 Gloria, I'm trying,
     but it's --

16:51.678 --> 16:53.177
             At least you're not
               the oldest dad.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.445
           Can't you enjoy that?

16:54.447 --> 16:55.813
          When was the last time

16:55.815 --> 16:58.516
            that you were
     the young stud in the room?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.551
    When I put Mom
in that nursing home.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.819
That was quite a rush.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.054
                 So, are you
              going to be nice?

17:03.056 --> 17:04.355
         Yes.
 He's not a bad guy.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.723
     And really,
   how much longer

17:05.724 --> 17:07.458
 am I gonna have to
  put up with him?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.160
                 Ay, no, Jay.
               Don't say that.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.728
            You're going to live
                a long life.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.563
       Not <i> me!</i>
 Grandpa out there!

17:12.565 --> 17:14.031
                    Shh!
              He can hear you.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.366
                      Hear what?

17:15.367 --> 17:16.634
            You were talking
        about my mustache again?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.636
           No, Manny.
     We love your mustache.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.137
               Oh, hilarious.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.739
         Tell me you like it
    now that I've shaved it off!

17:23.476 --> 17:25.643
Black mother and white father,
    but I've never met him.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.678
                Ah.
   That's a story
that should be out there more --

17:27.680 --> 17:29.080
white fathers
who abandon their families.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.849
                 What else?
                 What else?

17:31.851 --> 17:34.185
      So, this is Walter.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.854
 Just as I took over for Jeremy
     when <i> his</i> shift ended,

17:36.856 --> 17:38.423
      he'll be taking over
            for <i> me.</i>

17:38.425 --> 17:39.757
      Unless you're ready?

17:39.759 --> 17:42.293
I think we're still talking.
         But thanks.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.930
 Walter? Could I ask you a quick
    question right over there?

17:45.932 --> 17:48.332
    I'll be right back, too.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.601
 Hey! I just need a minute alone
   with my husband. Thank you.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.737
            There is no way
       you are paying that bill.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.372
           It has been out there
                  forever,

17:54.374 --> 17:56.240
    and he hasn't even <i> pretended</i>
      to reach for his wallet.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.843
  This is torture, Claire.
I'll pay <i> anything</i> to end it.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.178
                Stay strong.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.847
  (grunting) I'm weak.
You married a weak man!

18:02.849 --> 18:05.283
               Give it to me.
             Give it -- Phil --

18:06.586 --> 18:07.919
      No! Walter! Walter!

18:07.921 --> 18:09.187
            Walter!

18:09.189 --> 18:10.388
             D'Ohh!

18:10.390 --> 18:12.023
             Okay.
       Here's the thing.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.524
     We like hanging out --
                 No, Claire! No!

18:13.526 --> 18:15.059
             I know
             what this is about.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.761
      Tom, you should have
      paid the check. It's rude.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.229
  He's not rude. He's wonderful.
           I <i> had</i> to pay.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.597
              Why?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.532
 Phil, don't you say
  another word! Ow!

18:21.534 --> 18:23.067
                See? I told you.
          What the hell
        is going on here?

18:23.069 --> 18:24.769
     Nothing.
  Phil?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.070
                   Fine --
             if you have to know

18:26.072 --> 18:28.406
              every last detail
               about my life...

18:28.408 --> 18:30.475
    I lost a bet to Tom in Cabo.
      Now I owe him five meals.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.310
            There -- we're done.
  That's it.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.378
         Why didn't you
         just say that?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.914
         Th-- there's no reason.
                I don't...

18:36.916 --> 18:38.816
     What...was...the bet?

18:38.818 --> 18:40.952
   Phil, I mean it --
don't say another word.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.321
                They're gonna
             figure it out, Tom.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.723
How could they
figure out, Phil?
                They're gonna
                figure it out.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.593
    We were drunk on margaritas,
    and we wanted to find out

18:48.595 --> 18:50.461
            whose wife would eat
            the most crickets.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.963
             What?!
             What?!

18:51.965 --> 18:53.631
       Doesn't seem like
they were circling that, Phil.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.566
         You were just
      g-grabbing crickets

18:55.568 --> 18:57.468
       and sneaking them
         into our food?

18:57.470 --> 19:00.171
               Not live ones.
             They were roasted.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.439
             Oh, my God!

19:01.441 --> 19:02.940
   You're disgusting people.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.842
          You're missing
  the silver lining here, honey.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.177
               I lost the bet.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.445
          So I didn't
         eat crickets?

19:07.447 --> 19:09.147
You ate three.
              Ohh!

19:09.149 --> 19:10.915
                   Lisa had six.
              Six?!

19:10.917 --> 19:12.283
              You could've won
              with four!

19:12.285 --> 19:14.318
         Baby, baby,
I couldn't take that chance.

19:19.926 --> 19:22.126
   I'd like to give you two a
little something to think about.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.295
    Most of the food you eat
       is prepared by <i> us.</i>

19:24.297 --> 19:26.864
     Or by our private chef.
But I-I like where you're going.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.600
   Next time you take a bite
     of a big, juicy burger

19:29.602 --> 19:31.502
          or dig into
      a bowl of spaghetti,

19:31.504 --> 19:33.671
   there's gonna be an extra
  special ingredient in there,

19:33.673 --> 19:35.606
     and it won't be love.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.609
              Mm.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.346
       (sighs)

19:42.348 --> 19:44.582
            How many did you get
                  this time?
Two crickets.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.519
 Yes!
                   (sighs)

19:48.521 --> 19:50.288
             Okay,
     this makes more sense.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.323
       Barbra would never
   leave her gate wide open.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.824
                    RAY:
           They're broken, okay?

19:53.826 --> 19:55.860
            Don't make me regret
             bringing you here.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.128
            (buzzer)

19:57.130 --> 19:58.362
     MAN: Hello?

19:58.364 --> 19:59.630
               Is Barbra home?
              It's Ray Liotta.

19:59.632 --> 20:00.898
               You know,
          from "Goodfellas."

20:00.900 --> 20:02.466
"Something Wild."
    "Field of Dreams."

20:02.468 --> 20:04.235
BARBRA: Oh, I know who he is.
       What's up, Ray?

20:04.237 --> 20:05.803
            Barbra,
    I have some of your mail

20:05.805 --> 20:07.471
   from when you used to live
      over at Cedarhurst.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.207
    And I have a friend here
       that would like --

20:09.209 --> 20:11.642
Just leave the mail by the gate.
     I'll send someone down.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.412
                  O-Okay, but --
 Oy. There's more?

20:14.414 --> 20:16.414
  Uh, Ms. Streisand, hi. My --
 my name is Mitchell Pritchett,

20:16.416 --> 20:18.416
 and I have been a fan of yours
  since I can't even remember,

20:18.418 --> 20:20.384
    and -- oh, your artistry
         and integrity

20:20.386 --> 20:22.587
 has inspired me my whole life,
         and I just --

20:22.589 --> 20:25.590
  aaaah! I can't even believe
 I'm talking to you right now.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.725
      Please. I'm just
a regular person, like you.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.994
I have people put on my pants
      one leg at a time.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.729
           (laughing)
        that's so funny.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.898
                  Barbra,
          today is his birthday!

20:33.900 --> 20:35.366
       Well, technically,
    it was three weeks ago.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.667
                 All right,
             you're blowing it.
          Sorry.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.402
You sound very sweet,
      Mitchell.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.339
     I-I was thinking maybe as
   a special treat, you could --

20:41.341 --> 20:43.241
   I'm not singing
 into my gate, Ray.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.742
     Well, it was very nice
        to talk to you.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.210
           I did have
   a quick question about --

20:46.212 --> 20:47.445
      Goodbye.
             (click)

20:47.447 --> 20:49.213
             It's fine.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.514
          When I tell the story,

20:50.516 --> 20:52.016
        it ends with her singing
        "Happy Birthday."

20:57.724 --> 20:59.590
      Oh, shoot.
   It's past 3:00.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.759
          What's wrong?
      You late for dinner?
                            Jay.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.561
            Honey, it's okay.
         If we leave now, we --
No, no, I missed it.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.563
             What did you miss?

21:05.565 --> 21:07.131
It's Fred and Ginger week
         on TCM.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.533
They're showing "Swing Time,"
  and I forgot to record it.

21:09.535 --> 21:12.270
 Let me tell you about a little
   innovation called Netflix.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.238
       You'll never miss
      another movie again.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.207
     Really?
         Hand to God.

21:16.209 --> 21:18.142
         You pick a film
         on your computer.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.811
 Three days later,
 there's a disk in your mailbox.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.980
         You got to stay up
         with technology, Marty.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.582
    Wow. Thanks.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.585
Can you believe he doesn't know
        about streaming?

21:27.587 --> 21:30.388
       If I ever get
that out of touch, kill me.
