my zit with makeup,

would the zit
in the photo disappear,

be unable to conceal it

would be affected

to be Beach Day!

Got it.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.960
You know
what you look like?

06:40.920 --> 06:44.540
You know, this day
actually turned out
pretty good after all.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.170
[old lady]
Excuse me.

06:46.170 --> 06:47.750
I'm sorry to bother you.

06:47.750 --> 06:51.170
It's just, oh, you two
looked so cute earlier,

06:51.170 --> 06:54.500
and I just happened to see
this adorable young couple.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.880
We're not a couple. [gasp]

06:56.880 --> 06:59.790
[old lady] I debated whether
or not to even say anything,

06:59.790 --> 07:02.380
-but when opportunity
comes along like this...
-Ohh! Careful! [gasp]

07:02.380 --> 07:05.830
...well, you just have to take
the bull by the horns.

-[Star] Yah!
-Oh.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.620

It's the Beach Day photo!

07:14.580 --> 07:17.920
How... How? How!

07:17.920 --> 07:19.460
It's all part
of the paradox!

07:19.460 --> 07:22.040
We lost the camera
and the photo earlier today

07:22.040 --> 07:24.040
because I was supposed to,

07:24.040 --> 07:27.460
because this creepy lady
was meant to take
our Beach Day photo!

07:27.460 --> 07:29.620
So that means...

07:29.620 --> 07:31.750
[together]
Today is Beach Day!

07:31.750 --> 07:33.540
-Woo-hoo!
-It is Beach Day!
It is Beach Day!

07:33.540 --> 07:35.210
It gonna happen!

07:35.210 --> 07:37.920
-I lived the happiest day
of my life!
-Wow! Wow!

07:37.920 --> 07:39.420
[Marco]
This is bananas!

07:39.420 --> 07:40.790
The paradox came true!

07:40.790 --> 07:42.330
It was real!

07:42.330 --> 07:44.380
Everything happened
for a reason!

07:44.380 --> 07:45.750
Wow! Oh, my goodness!

07:45.750 --> 07:47.670
I'm so excited! Star?

07:51.380 --> 07:54.170
Ha ha ha! [humming]

07:54.170 --> 07:55.920
-[Star] Hey! Father Time?
-Ooh!

07:55.920 --> 07:57.710
Why am I not happy?

07:57.710 --> 08:00.250
Oh, hey!
It's that beach photo.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.920
You look pretty happy to me.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.620
No. I was happy.

08:03.620 --> 08:04.920
But that was, like,
five minutes ago,

08:04.920 --> 08:06.750
and it's already starting
to wear off!

08:06.750 --> 08:08.000
I thought Beach Day
was supposed to be

08:08.000 --> 08:09.420
the best day of my life!

08:09.420 --> 08:11.380
And everything would be
figured out,

08:11.380 --> 08:13.000
and then I could just live
happily ever after
or whatever!

08:13.000 --> 08:14.460
But that didn't happen.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.830
So why'd you even
give this to me?

08:15.830 --> 08:17.210
I didn't give that to you.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.830
Uh, yes, you did.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.040
No, no, no.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.000
-You did.
-What?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.880
Yeah, you gave me the photo
to give to Past Star,

08:24.880 --> 08:26.500
because you knew
she was about to go through

08:26.500 --> 08:28.460
a lot of difficult,
messy life stuff,

08:28.460 --> 08:30.420
you know, what,
with her mom going missing

08:30.420 --> 08:31.830
and her identity
as a princess

08:31.830 --> 08:33.420
kind of thrown
out the window,

08:33.420 --> 08:36.420
you wanted to give her something
to look forward to.

08:36.420 --> 08:39.000
I gave this to me?

08:39.000 --> 08:42.880
But that can't--
That means this whole time

08:42.880 --> 08:44.830
Beach Day was a lie?

08:44.830 --> 08:47.420
A lie I told myself?!

08:47.420 --> 08:48.880
I can just destroy it
for you,

08:48.880 --> 08:51.080
seeing as it's giving you
so much grief.

08:51.080 --> 08:53.000
You know what?
Yeah, sure.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.500
Beach Day, no Beach Day,
what's the difference?

08:55.500 --> 08:59.580
So what if I don't see it
up on the fridge every day,

08:59.580 --> 09:03.080
or keep it
in my little purse always,

09:03.080 --> 09:06.790
or stuff it
under my pillow every night.

09:06.790 --> 09:08.290
Yeah, who needs it?

09:08.290 --> 09:11.710
No photo, no Beach Day,
no confusing time paradox!

09:11.710 --> 09:14.920
You wouldn't even be here
right now asking about it!

09:14.920 --> 09:16.710
Who knows where you'd be?

09:16.710 --> 09:19.000
That's a...
That's a good question.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.540
Some days,
knowing I'd be this happy

09:20.540 --> 09:23.040
was the only thing
that kept me going.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.000
So you want me to destroy it?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.880
No. No! No, no, no!

09:26.880 --> 09:28.580
You can't!
I needed this!

09:28.580 --> 09:30.170
You gotta give it
to Past Star!

09:30.170 --> 09:32.000
Wait! No! I don't want
to give it away.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.290
But if I keep it,

09:33.290 --> 09:34.750
I'll never have
given it to myself,

09:34.750 --> 09:35.920
so I'll never have had it,

09:35.920 --> 09:37.880
and then it'll never
have existed at all.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.460
[gasps] Whoa!

09:40.460 --> 09:41.880
Okay, okay, you know what?

09:41.880 --> 09:43.500
[click]

09:43.500 --> 09:45.000
There.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.290
Now she can have it.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.540
Bye, Father Time.
Thank you, so much.

09:54.540 --> 09:56.080
-Sure thing!
-[portal bloops]

09:56.080 --> 09:58.540
Too bad the hardest times
are still ahead.

09:58.540 --> 09:59.830
What was that?

09:59.830 --> 10:02.040
Nothing!

10:02.040 --> 10:04.080
[humming]

10:04.080 --> 10:07.670
B-E-A-C-H...

10:07.670 --> 10:10.080
"Beach Day!"

10:10.080 --> 10:12.080
[seagulls calling]

10:12.080 --> 10:16.080
So basically,
Beach Day was never real.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.920
I was chasing
some perfect idea
that didn't even exist.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.080
Don't get me wrong,
it got me though
a lot, but...

10:22.080 --> 10:25.880
now how am I supposed
to know if everything
will end up okay?

10:25.880 --> 10:28.330
Well, I guess we just don't.

10:28.330 --> 10:29.670
Huh?

10:29.670 --> 10:31.290
Yeah, I mean...

10:31.290 --> 10:33.080
you don't know what'll
happen in the future,

10:33.080 --> 10:34.880
but who does?

10:34.880 --> 10:37.540
It wasn't the Beach Day
itself that made
you happy, right?

10:37.540 --> 10:39.040
It-- It was--

10:39.040 --> 10:40.040
It was you.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.460
Huh.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.120
You didn't wait
for someone to tell you

10:43.120 --> 10:44.670
everything would be okay.

10:44.670 --> 10:46.330
You created
your own happiness,

10:46.330 --> 10:49.080
through self-determination!

10:49.080 --> 10:51.500
Anyway, I thought
that was pretty cool.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.080
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.790
Well, I'm kinda
Beach Day'd out. [chuckles]

10:56.790 --> 10:58.080
Whaddaya say we head home?

10:58.080 --> 10:59.250
I say let's do it.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.330
Wait! We don't have
a way to get home!

11:01.330 --> 11:03.210
Actually...

11:06.790 --> 11:08.710
Ah? Ahh?

11:08.710 --> 11:11.330
Star, I'm not wheeling you
all the way home
in a shopping cart.

11:11.330 --> 11:13.580
[chuckles]
Not wheeling, silly.

11:14.790 --> 11:16.000
-Woo-hoo-hoo! Woo-hoo!
-Aaah!

11:16.000 --> 11:17.500
No no no!

11:17.500 --> 11:19.540
Ha ha! Woo-hoo!

11:19.540 --> 11:21.040
[Marco]
I'm gonna be sick,

11:21.040 --> 11:22.170
but it's worth it
for Beach Day!

11:22.170 --> 11:23.580
[Star] Beach Daaay!
