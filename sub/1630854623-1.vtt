WEBVTT

01:13.750 --> 01:15.166
No!

01:18.875 --> 01:21.833
No! Fucking fuckity fucking fucking fuck!

01:27.500 --> 01:29.458
Aah!

01:31.333 --> 01:32.333
Ah!

01:32.416 --> 01:34.958
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

01:37.500 --> 01:39.125
Fuck!

01:41.333 --> 01:42.500
No! No!

01:43.458 --> 01:45.458
-Don't! No!

01:46.666 --> 01:48.125
-Oh…

01:57.166 --> 01:58.791
Ooh… Oooh!

01:58.875 --> 02:01.208
Wow. Wow, wow!

02:02.708 --> 02:04.750
Ooh. Wow.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.250
Well, this is weird.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.833
Um…

02:10.416 --> 02:12.000
All right. What…

02:15.958 --> 02:16.875
Hello?

02:17.583 --> 02:18.958
Nope, nothing?

02:20.083 --> 02:22.500
Yaah… all right.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.791
What do we do, Jaskier?
What do we do in situations like this? We…

02:28.791 --> 02:30.250
we revert to the basics.

02:31.583 --> 02:32.625
Hello!

02:33.125 --> 02:35.083
Hello!

02:35.166 --> 02:37.916
-Hello, Sandpiper.
-Aah! Aah…

02:38.833 --> 02:40.250
This is new.

02:40.333 --> 02:42.833
Uh, for the record, I'm not…

02:44.250 --> 02:45.666
I'm not <i>not </i>into it.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.083
Good-looking man, nice boots.

02:48.583 --> 02:49.875
Am I dead?

02:50.625 --> 02:52.583
Aah! Ow, ow!

02:53.416 --> 02:54.291
Not dead.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.666
I'm getting that.

02:58.166 --> 03:00.666
So you… you are something else.

03:02.083 --> 03:03.083
You're a Doppler.

03:06.583 --> 03:07.625
No.

03:18.416 --> 03:19.583
Not a Doppler.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.791
What are you?

03:31.708 --> 03:35.458
I am many things. Many faces. Many places.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.041
-Then why do you look like me?
-Because you love yourself.

03:40.291 --> 03:41.500
I have other faces.

03:41.583 --> 03:42.458
If you prefer.

03:49.916 --> 03:50.791
Better?

03:51.500 --> 03:52.958
Oh… Whoa…

03:54.083 --> 03:55.208
Um…

03:57.541 --> 03:58.541
Yep. Yeah.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.125
Wonderful.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.583
Why did you save me from the Temerians?

04:04.666 --> 04:07.083
I need you to sing a story back to life.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.083
We're related, you and I.

04:11.958 --> 04:14.625
You're a bard. I am a storyteller.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.458
-Of a sort.

04:16.541 --> 04:20.583
I beg to differ. You-- <i>you</i> are
a time-stopping, shape-shifting,

04:20.666 --> 04:24.791
probably-gonna-eat-me-without-salt
at-some-point sort of storyteller.

04:24.875 --> 04:30.000
I-- I'm just-- I'm just a man,
with an admittedly… fun hat.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.541
We're not the same. You're--

04:31.625 --> 04:34.958
I slip between worlds and times,
collecting forgotten stories.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.916
I bring them back to life
when the world needs them.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.458
Are you sure you've got
the right man for this?

04:48.541 --> 04:50.291
Of course I am.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.791
You're the Sandpiper.

04:53.416 --> 04:55.083
Smuggler of elves to safety.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.000
The Sandpiper's a name.
It's a title. I'm just a bard.

04:58.083 --> 05:02.083
A bard the Scoia'tael risked
attacking a Temerian army camp to save.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
They know you care for them.
Their struggle for justice.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.500
I do.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.541
The Scoia'tael mean well,

05:11.166 --> 05:16.000
but elfkind cannot win
fuelled by pain and anger alone.

05:17.666 --> 05:18.750
Hope is vital.

05:21.083 --> 05:25.750
The elves need a story lost to time.
One of the few who overcame the many.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.458
The Story of the Seven.

05:27.541 --> 05:30.125
The St… the Story of…

05:30.833 --> 05:31.916
Let me guess.

05:32.416 --> 05:37.000
A bunch of warriors join forces
to fight against all odds.

05:37.083 --> 05:40.000
It has been done to death.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.041
Has it?

05:41.125 --> 05:46.000
Seven estranged warriors who come together
to fight an unstoppable empire,

05:46.083 --> 05:50.875
bring humans and monsters to the world
via the Conjunction of the Spheres,

05:50.958 --> 05:54.041
and create the very first version
of a witcher.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.625
That's been done to death?

05:58.250 --> 05:59.250
Uh…

06:00.583 --> 06:01.750
No.

06:01.833 --> 06:05.041
No, no, I've--
I've not heard that one, admittedly.

06:05.125 --> 06:06.041
Wow!

06:06.125 --> 06:08.125
That's very different.

06:08.208 --> 06:09.958
Ooh!

06:10.041 --> 06:11.666
This is really fun.

06:11.750 --> 06:15.583
You're telling me that the first version
of a witcher was a badass elf?

06:16.291 --> 06:18.458
This is really gonna piss Geralt off.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.000
All right.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.000
Where do we start?

06:24.500 --> 06:26.166
It all began twelve hundred years ago.

06:27.833 --> 06:29.416
In the Elven golden era.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.375
Before the arrival
of humans and monsters in the world.

06:34.291 --> 06:36.125
Six lone outcasts,

06:36.708 --> 06:38.458
strangers to each other,

06:39.208 --> 06:42.541
destined to be bound together
in a blood quest.

06:44.916 --> 06:46.625
<i>Fjall of Dog Clan.</i>

06:50.500 --> 06:52.291
<i>Scían of Ghost Tribe.</i>

06:56.666 --> 06:58.125
<i>Brother Death.</i>

06:59.541 --> 07:01.708
<i>The mages Zacaré and Syndril.</i>

07:04.166 --> 07:06.875
<i>Meldof and her vengeful hammer, Gwen.</i>

07:11.375 --> 07:13.416
<i>Soon to be led by the seventh.</i>

07:14.375 --> 07:16.833
<i>The one they called the Lark.</i>

07:38.333 --> 07:41.291
Good morning.
Alms for an ex-soldier?

07:44.916 --> 07:46.291
Thank you.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.625
Do they have music here?

07:47.708 --> 07:51.250
Hasn't been music on the island in years.

07:55.666 --> 07:57.208
Good luck.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.625
-You too.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.083
-Oh!

08:39.166 --> 08:40.083
My.

08:40.583 --> 08:42.458
Aren't you the pretty young bud?

08:46.250 --> 08:48.541
-I'd say you're ripe for flowering.

08:48.625 --> 08:51.666
Ithlinne is not right, sir. She has fits.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.875
Please, let her go.
You can all drink for free.

08:53.958 --> 08:55.125
-Ma!

09:07.166 --> 09:09.625
I'll fucking stop you!
Fucking come on!

09:17.708 --> 09:18.750
Sorry, friends.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.291
Can't abide bad manners.

09:24.791 --> 09:26.041
To the Lark!

09:26.125 --> 09:27.125
The Lark!

09:46.250 --> 09:47.583
Go on, you girl!

09:50.791 --> 09:52.000
Go on!

09:57.750 --> 09:59.958
<i>Far south from Inis Dubh,</i>

10:00.041 --> 10:04.250
<i>the newly crowned King Alvitir,</i>
<i>determined to be seen amongst his people,</i>

10:04.333 --> 10:06.250
<i>toured the lowborn streets,</i>

10:06.791 --> 10:09.458
<i>despite the threat of assassins</i>
<i>from other kingdoms.</i>

10:11.875 --> 10:13.166
Protect the king!

10:13.250 --> 10:17.833
<i>But first they would have to get through</i>
<i>the royal protectors, Dog Clan.</i>

10:22.125 --> 10:23.583
<i>And their greatest warrior…</i>

10:25.791 --> 10:26.916
<i>…Fjall Stoneheart.</i>

10:28.375 --> 10:29.250
Princess!

10:30.041 --> 10:30.916
I've got you.

10:31.875 --> 10:33.416
-Yah! Yah!

10:34.833 --> 10:36.083
Yah! Yah!

10:37.375 --> 10:38.250
Get back!

10:39.875 --> 10:41.000
Get away!

10:42.875 --> 10:43.958
Down!

10:48.625 --> 10:49.791
Like I showed you.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.875
-Aah.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.208
-Good?
-Good.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.166
Enter.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.250
-Apologies.
-It's all right, Fjall.

11:35.875 --> 11:37.458
Decorum be damned.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.166
Dog Clan sealed the palace.

11:44.041 --> 11:46.750
No one's in or out
until we find out who's behind this.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.708
Now, I want you to hang on to this.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.125
Just for now.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.375
You saved us.

11:57.375 --> 11:58.416
You saved me.

11:59.666 --> 12:00.916
You saved yourself.

12:03.916 --> 12:06.916
You've always been there
when I've needed you.

12:09.125 --> 12:10.125
It's my duty.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.416
Well, we both know
that it's more than that.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.166
-We agreed.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.625
You might be able to forget, but I can't.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.583
I haven't forgotten.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.708
-If we'd have been caught--
-But we weren't.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.541
Fjall, I nearly died today.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.833
I won't die living a lie.

13:00.625 --> 13:02.583
I was born to be your protector.

13:05.125 --> 13:06.333
So protect me.

13:14.791 --> 13:16.500
No markings on the assassins.

13:16.583 --> 13:18.791
Captain Eredin
is rounding up suspects for interrogation.

13:18.875 --> 13:21.125
Eredin doesn't know
his arse from his elbow.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.541
Fuck him and his shiny army.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.750
Where the fuck were they today
when it counted?

13:24.833 --> 13:27.041
Couldn't organize a ride in a brothel.

13:27.833 --> 13:28.750
Where's Fjall?

13:42.541 --> 13:43.541
Fuck.

13:49.041 --> 13:51.416
Just kill me. Be done with it.

13:51.916 --> 13:53.958
No. You need to suffer.

13:54.666 --> 13:55.958
In disgrace.

13:56.041 --> 13:59.416
New king,
assassins waitin' in every shadow,

13:59.500 --> 14:01.375
and you couldn't even keep control
of your cock.

14:02.416 --> 14:06.166
Thank the gods Kareg didn't live
to see you betray your own clan.

14:06.250 --> 14:09.166
I know you wished he returned from battle
that day instead of me.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.375
I never said that.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.500
Didn't have to.

14:14.958 --> 14:17.000
I've wished the same every day since.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.708
I needed both of you by my side.

14:20.375 --> 14:24.625
He was taken, and you were supposed
to take over as chieftain.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.458
But you betrayed your clan.

14:28.625 --> 14:29.625
Your oath.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.708
You betrayed <i>me.</i>

14:37.083 --> 14:38.250
The border.

14:40.958 --> 14:41.833
Aye.

14:47.458 --> 14:48.791
Let's be done with it.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.916
Fjall Stoneheart,

14:58.000 --> 15:02.041
you have broken your oath
as royal protector

15:02.125 --> 15:03.916
and betrayed your birth clan.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.500
You are hereby banished from Xin'trea.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.708
Dog Clan disown you.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.041
As do I.

15:28.375 --> 15:31.041
You'll die forgotten. And unspoken.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
Goodbye, Father.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.041
Yah!

16:01.125 --> 16:02.625
-Shall I guess?

16:02.708 --> 16:04.708
The <i>Solryth Sagas.</i>

16:04.791 --> 16:06.250
Don't mock, brother.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.750
You're obsessed. You need
at least one friend who isn't a book.

16:12.625 --> 16:16.125
I don't know how you live like this.
Mm-- The smell alone.

16:16.208 --> 16:21.458
All this is our future.
What has happened will happen again.

16:21.541 --> 16:23.541
-Oh, you're a seer now.
-No.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.708
I just don't deny
what's in front of my own eyes.

16:28.250 --> 16:31.750
Dwarven script, fifteen hundred years old,

16:31.833 --> 16:33.916
telling of Solryth's arrival.

16:34.458 --> 16:39.083
The siege of their city
before she drove them out

16:39.166 --> 16:41.833
and built Xin'trea on its ruins.

16:41.916 --> 16:44.875
History is all around us, brother,

16:45.708 --> 16:48.375
reminding us how brilliant we once were,

16:48.458 --> 16:51.458
and how brilliant
we can be again if we try.

16:52.916 --> 16:55.958
I could be of use to you, you know.

16:56.041 --> 16:57.250
As an-- an adviser--

16:57.333 --> 17:00.000
The generals and mages
would eat you alive.

17:02.083 --> 17:05.750
But there is a role for you, sister,
in all of this.

17:05.833 --> 17:09.291
Now that your little indiscretion
with Fjall has been taken care of,

17:09.375 --> 17:11.166
it's time to look to the future.

17:11.250 --> 17:14.041
-I've found a worthy suitor for you.

17:14.125 --> 17:16.125
The king of Pryshia is a widower.

17:16.625 --> 17:20.708
A marriage between our kingdoms
would make him amenable to signing.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.875
Oh…

17:25.958 --> 17:30.458
Of course.
Whatever… you need to achieve peace.

17:33.416 --> 17:36.416
A brighter future. Thanks to you.

17:37.041 --> 17:38.125
Hmm?

17:38.708 --> 17:41.208
Queen Merwyn of Pryshia.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.416
<i>Deep in the Valley of Lost Souls,</i>

17:59.500 --> 18:02.833
<i>a lone warrior sought answers</i>
<i>to the strange skies</i>

18:02.916 --> 18:06.875
<i>that had suddenly cast</i>
<i>their ominous shadow across the land.</i>

18:08.583 --> 18:10.791
<i>But her ancestors remained silent.</i>

18:12.291 --> 18:14.583
<i>Nothing like this</i>
<i>had ever happened before.</i>

18:17.250 --> 18:21.625
<i>For another had learned to tear</i>
<i>the veils between worlds.</i>

18:47.750 --> 18:49.041
I've returned.

18:51.041 --> 18:55.541
<i>Defeated or victorious, Chief Sage Balor?</i>

18:56.666 --> 18:58.791
My assassination attempt failed.

18:59.416 --> 19:00.750
I need your help<i>.</i>

19:06.208 --> 19:09.000
So tell me, how did you learn to fight?

19:12.041 --> 19:13.750
I was born into Raven Clan.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.125
No! You were a protector?

19:16.208 --> 19:17.125
Indeed.

19:18.125 --> 19:21.750
Loyal bodyguard to King Midir
and the royal family of Pryshia.

19:21.833 --> 19:24.041
So you must know
Lady Cethlenn of the Knives.

19:24.791 --> 19:25.666
She's my mother.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.166
-What?

19:27.250 --> 19:28.958
What are you doing here?

19:29.541 --> 19:33.083
You could be at the palace
with the kings and queens and heroes.

19:33.583 --> 19:35.083
I chose this path.

19:37.416 --> 19:38.875
When I was a young girl,

19:39.750 --> 19:42.416
my sword master had
a key harp on her wall.

19:43.625 --> 19:44.916
I fell in love with it.

19:45.916 --> 19:49.625
My mother tried to save me,
but I was lost to the music.

19:50.375 --> 19:53.708
And so I became a roving bard.

19:55.291 --> 19:56.291
Here.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.958
I wish I had a calling
for something like that.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.875
All I have is a sickness.

20:19.958 --> 20:22.625
I have visions, fits,

20:23.250 --> 20:26.958
and the people in the town
are scared of me.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.916
The ignorant are always jealous
of anyone with gifts.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.166
-Open up!

20:36.250 --> 20:38.583
-Or we'll burn this hole to the ground.
-Oh, shit.

20:38.666 --> 20:39.541
You in there?

20:39.625 --> 20:42.666
Why do assholes run to town guards
when they get their asses kicked?

20:47.916 --> 20:49.583
Singing, my ass!

21:01.041 --> 21:03.333
Dog Clan? What the fuck?

21:04.250 --> 21:05.333
Hey!

21:05.916 --> 21:09.000
Aah. One of Cethlenn's
scrawny little ravens.

21:09.083 --> 21:12.208
Better a scrawny raven
than one of Osfar's mangy bitches.

21:13.541 --> 21:14.750
Huh?

21:14.833 --> 21:17.583
Aye. Probably right there, Raven.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.833
-The name's--
-Fjall Stoneheart.

21:19.916 --> 21:21.083
Son of Osfar.

21:21.166 --> 21:22.541
I remember that pendant

21:22.625 --> 21:25.708
from when you took my cousin's eye
in the Battle of Brokilon.

21:25.791 --> 21:28.416
I swore to her I'd kill you
if we ever crossed paths again.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.791
I see. And I don't even remember you.

21:30.875 --> 21:32.791
I'm the one who sends you to the clay.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.500
Relax.

21:36.375 --> 21:39.208
My Dog Clan days are done.

21:39.291 --> 21:40.375
Horseshit.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.458
No one leaves Dog Clan.

21:42.541 --> 21:44.041
And yet here I am,

21:44.125 --> 21:48.291
earning my fortune as a sellsword
on a poxy island at the edge of the world.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.625
What the fuck's a Raven Clan warrior
doing so far north?

21:51.708 --> 21:53.916
Not a warrior. I'm a bard.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.916
A Raven Clan bard?

21:58.708 --> 21:59.875
That's a first.

22:00.666 --> 22:01.541
Wait.

22:02.291 --> 22:05.083
You're not the Lark everyone round here's
been goin' on about?

22:06.500 --> 22:10.083
I'd planned to come see you sing myself.
If not for the current circumstances.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.750
How did the son of mighty Osfar
fall so far?

22:15.500 --> 22:16.541
Easy.

22:18.125 --> 22:19.583
Fucked the princess.

22:19.666 --> 22:23.250
Horseshit. Your head'd be on a pike
rotting over the city gate.

22:23.333 --> 22:24.541
And embarrass the Crown?

22:25.958 --> 22:26.916
No.

22:27.500 --> 22:31.000
Better I be stripped of my clan
and banished in silent disgrace.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.291
Can't blame them.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.541
Protect, not fuck. Clan basics.

22:35.625 --> 22:37.666
-Should have got that one tattooed.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.625
Too long a phrase for a Dog Clan cock.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.791
I'll remember that when your head
rolls to a bloody stop in the mud.

22:44.916 --> 22:46.666
Looks like we've ran out of time.

22:47.875 --> 22:49.958
You, back against the far wall.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.500
And you, your freedom's been bought.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.958
-What?
-You heard me.

22:58.958 --> 23:00.083
Well,

23:01.791 --> 23:05.416
many thanks for not trying to kill me
in my sleep.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.375
There's still time.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.625
-An eye for an eye.

23:08.708 --> 23:11.291
Hey, get back! Back up!

23:12.000 --> 23:13.708
-Back!

23:13.791 --> 23:15.500
I said back against the wall!

23:20.166 --> 23:21.791
Fare thee well, Lark.

23:22.583 --> 23:25.333
May the executioner's blade
be keen and quick.

23:26.250 --> 23:27.416
Actually, fuck it.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.708
I don't give a shit.

23:42.833 --> 23:43.666
Report.

23:43.750 --> 23:47.833
The Pryshians have been running
some harrying raids. Testing our lines.

23:47.916 --> 23:50.958
If we offer the dwarves
access to our Xin'trean mines,

23:51.041 --> 23:53.375
-we can count their alliance to our--
-No. No.

23:53.458 --> 23:56.875
I cannot fight a war on two fronts
and keep my kingdom from starving.

23:58.708 --> 23:59.958
I've a new plan.

24:01.291 --> 24:03.500
End the Thousand-Year War.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.916
I've already sent emissaries
to Pryshia and Darwen.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.583
-A peace treaty is to be signed here.
-Preposterous.

24:08.666 --> 24:10.500
-It'll be our end!
-Sire.

24:11.416 --> 24:13.875
Pryshia and Darwen will never sign.

24:13.958 --> 24:15.166
-This war--
-Will end.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.541
They're as stretched to breaking
as we are.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.083
My sister is to be married to King Midir.

24:20.166 --> 24:23.166
Our mines in Sliabh Liath
will be gifted to Queen Neera.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.791
They will sign.

24:24.875 --> 24:26.583
What say you, Chief Sage?

24:26.666 --> 24:28.916
Apologies, Captain Eredin.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.166
The role of chief sage is
no longer one of adviser to the throne.

24:32.250 --> 24:34.583
I'm merely here
to advise on matters of magic.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.666
If we keep warring as we are,

24:37.750 --> 24:40.791
famine and the stench of defeat
will be our only legacy.

24:41.916 --> 24:43.875
-Sire--
-This peace treaty will happen.

24:45.625 --> 24:46.708
Dismissed.

24:47.791 --> 24:51.000
-Fjall!

24:52.250 --> 24:53.375
Shen.

24:54.416 --> 24:55.708
It's good to see you.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.791
-Did you bribe the guards?
Listen.

24:59.958 --> 25:03.375
Osfar wants you to return immediately.
There's to be a peace treaty.

25:03.875 --> 25:06.583
The king's arranged
a signing between the kingdoms.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.125
The answer's no, little cousin.

25:12.916 --> 25:15.750
-Where are you going?
-To find the nearest brothel.

25:16.250 --> 25:17.708
What'll I tell your father?

25:17.791 --> 25:20.958
Tell him I'm too busy dying,
forgotten and unspoken.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.250
Now go home, Shen!

25:24.458 --> 25:26.375
Good elves of Inis Dubh.

25:26.875 --> 25:29.500
Are you well? Because you're looking well.

25:29.583 --> 25:32.666
I have but a few hours left
on this shithole of an island.

25:33.250 --> 25:39.333
Who wants to ply me with the finest skril
and unspeakable debauchery, huh?

25:40.125 --> 25:43.166
Behind these doors
lies a veritable cornucopia

25:43.250 --> 25:46.583
of delectable depravities
and unmentionable delights.

25:46.666 --> 25:50.958
But first we must address
the sordid issue of coin.

25:51.041 --> 25:52.083
Ah, yes.

25:52.708 --> 25:55.541
My word is my coin.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.500
Your word affords you…

25:58.083 --> 26:00.083
naught but the greasing of a cat's arse.

26:01.458 --> 26:03.375
-Sylanya, go find Fluffy!
-Hup-hup-hup.

26:04.375 --> 26:05.333
I can pay in silver.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.125
-Look at that!

26:11.250 --> 26:12.250
Fuck.

26:15.125 --> 26:16.500
Ah, yes.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.875
We'll make a player of you yet…

26:39.416 --> 26:43.083
Never really understood why you chose
this thing over an honest blade.

26:43.666 --> 26:45.500
It's so… fragile.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.166
You've not changed.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.000
You have.

26:53.791 --> 26:55.666
Mother sent me to bring you home.

26:55.750 --> 26:58.250
The Continent's changing
beneath our feet.

26:58.333 --> 27:02.083
Your king's travelling to Xin'trea
to sign a treaty. We need your skills.

27:03.916 --> 27:05.958
I no longer follow the way of the blade.

27:11.041 --> 27:12.041
And yet…

27:16.500 --> 27:18.375
She's really willing to forgive me?

27:18.458 --> 27:22.458
Cethlenn needs you. This is your chance
to redeem yourself, sister.

27:24.625 --> 27:25.583
I can't.

27:26.166 --> 27:27.958
I can't do those things again.

27:28.958 --> 27:31.750
How can you live like this?
Don't you miss it?

27:31.833 --> 27:32.833
I miss you.

27:34.541 --> 27:35.375
Desperately.

27:35.458 --> 27:36.875
Then come back to us.

27:41.958 --> 27:44.250
The others said
this would be a waste of time.

27:44.833 --> 27:47.500
Help me prove them wrong, sister.

27:52.250 --> 27:55.458
It's your last chance.
I sail on the next tide.

28:01.708 --> 28:03.125
Are you all right?

28:21.458 --> 28:23.791
The time of the spheres is upon us.

28:23.875 --> 28:26.458
Worlds will eat worlds. Emerald skies.

28:26.541 --> 28:28.041
Fire will summon a new dawn.

28:28.125 --> 28:31.375
A great beast born
shall be slain by your blade.

28:31.458 --> 28:33.291
Two apart shall become two as one.

28:33.375 --> 28:36.208
The Lark's most precious notes

28:36.291 --> 28:39.000
shall be the key to all things.

28:39.083 --> 28:44.125
And a quest in the name of your clan
will bring you redemption.

28:46.583 --> 28:50.041
Ithlinne said I'd find redemption
in a quest for my clan.

28:50.875 --> 28:53.583
Her visions,
have any of them ever come true?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.125
All of them.

28:58.125 --> 28:59.333
One way or another.

29:05.250 --> 29:07.875
Here. Give this to her when she wakes.

29:09.541 --> 29:12.833
Tell her I'm… sorry
I couldn't wait to say goodbye.

29:15.625 --> 29:19.208
-Hopefully, our paths will cross some day.
-Where's the road takin' you?

29:22.250 --> 29:23.500
To seek redemption.

29:26.041 --> 29:26.875
Niamh!

29:28.750 --> 29:30.166
Can't let you travel alone.

29:31.791 --> 29:33.791
Some wicked elf might steal your virtue.

29:34.666 --> 29:39.041
Not enough to have a musician sister.
Now I must suffer a shit jester too.

29:39.625 --> 29:41.916
Don't make me change my mind, wench.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.958
As if anyone's capable of that.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.500
I'm just glad you're--

29:49.791 --> 29:50.708
No!

30:02.583 --> 30:05.083
Show yourselves, you fucking bastards!

30:45.916 --> 30:47.416
That's my fuckin' pendant.

30:51.708 --> 30:52.666
Skills!

31:04.666 --> 31:05.791
I hate runnin'.

31:19.708 --> 31:21.208
What the fuck are you doing here?

31:21.291 --> 31:23.166
Lookin' for a boat off this shithole.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.916
You're welcome, by the way.

31:30.916 --> 31:32.291
Who's the warrior?

31:35.125 --> 31:36.125
My sister.

31:48.791 --> 31:49.708
What the fuck?

31:52.083 --> 31:52.916
This mark.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.666
Xin'trean army. Fifth column.

32:04.375 --> 32:05.541
I know her.

32:05.625 --> 32:08.208
She's a cavalry captain
in the Pryshian army.

32:08.291 --> 32:09.916
A Darwenish infantry dagger.

32:12.583 --> 32:14.208
It makes no sense.

32:14.291 --> 32:16.708
Why are soldiers
from three kingdoms at war

32:16.791 --> 32:18.291
working together to kill us?

32:20.083 --> 32:21.041
The treaty.

32:22.125 --> 32:25.666
-Niamh came to tell me about a treaty.
-I know. I was sent for too.

32:27.166 --> 32:29.291
-Shit!
-Someone didn't want clan warriors there.

32:29.375 --> 32:32.041
It's the armies, they're finally
making a move against the monarchies.

32:32.125 --> 32:35.500
-I need to get to Xin'trea, warn my clan.
-So do I.

32:35.583 --> 32:36.958
Fuck your clan.

32:37.041 --> 32:40.291
Look, there are bound to be
more of these stabby fuckers on the way.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.083
We'll have more chance
if we stick together.

32:43.166 --> 32:45.083
Despite you being a pain in me hole.

32:49.791 --> 32:50.708
Fine.

32:50.791 --> 32:51.916
Right.

32:53.125 --> 32:56.416
But cross me
and I'll feed your cock to the dogs.

32:59.041 --> 33:00.958
I don't fucking trust you, Stoneheart.

33:01.625 --> 33:02.458
Nor I you…

33:05.416 --> 33:06.250
Lark.

33:06.333 --> 33:07.708
They killed my sister.

33:07.791 --> 33:09.250
The Lark is dead.

33:11.791 --> 33:12.958
My name is Éile.

33:16.208 --> 33:19.666
We'll meet again
in the halls of Caer Aenwyn, sister.

33:27.666 --> 33:30.625
<i>And so the Lark no longer soared alone.</i>

33:31.291 --> 33:33.458
<i>One had become two.</i>

33:58.875 --> 34:00.500
Please.

34:00.583 --> 34:01.583
Princess?

34:02.166 --> 34:05.791
Ket, I fixed it!
Solryth's eyes blaze once more.

34:05.875 --> 34:07.166
We need to get you dressed.

34:07.250 --> 34:11.375
Don't you see? When all hope was lost,
they led her ships to this continent,

34:11.458 --> 34:13.541
and now they light our skies again.

34:13.625 --> 34:15.291
It's a sign, Ket.

34:15.375 --> 34:17.625
Maybe there's hope for me too.

34:18.500 --> 34:21.166
Your brother will have my guts
if I don't make you look presentable

34:21.250 --> 34:23.083
in time to meet your future husband.

34:24.708 --> 34:25.708
Yes, of course.

34:32.916 --> 34:36.375
<i>With highborn hostages</i>
<i>exchanged between the warring kingdoms,</i>

34:36.458 --> 34:38.875
<i>the other monarchs</i>
<i>had sailed to sign a treaty</i>

34:38.958 --> 34:41.625
<i>that would finally end</i>
<i>the Thousand-Year War.</i>

34:42.791 --> 34:46.083
<i>King Midir of Pryshia</i>
<i>and his Raven Clan warriors.</i>

34:46.666 --> 34:50.750
<i>Queen Neera of Darwen</i>
<i>and her Serpent Clan warriors.</i>

34:51.666 --> 34:56.416
<i>And Alvitir, the brave architect</i>
<i>of a new dawn for elfkind.</i>

35:03.125 --> 35:04.875
I love you, brother.

35:21.250 --> 35:23.541
Warriors of Xin'trea.

35:25.166 --> 35:28.166
Thanks to the bravery of our royal guests,

35:29.166 --> 35:34.708
today shall see our long, dark night
of war and hunger end at last.

35:35.708 --> 35:40.375
A new dawn will rise upon the Continent
for all elfkind.

35:40.958 --> 35:45.000
Famine replaced by peace and prosperity.

35:46.041 --> 35:48.916
A united Continent once again.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.041
-A Continent of possibility.

35:53.291 --> 35:55.291
We are Xin'trean.

35:55.375 --> 35:57.041
We are Pryshian.

35:57.125 --> 35:58.625
We are Darwenish.

35:59.666 --> 36:01.458
-But we will all be…
-Your Majesty?

36:01.541 --> 36:03.083
-Summon the physic.
-No.

36:03.166 --> 36:05.666
-It's just… nerves.
-…one, as strong and…

36:05.750 --> 36:07.666
Perhaps I should retire to my chambers.

36:07.750 --> 36:11.541
…day we first landed
on these shores and civilized this land.

36:12.666 --> 36:13.791
So I call upon…

36:15.500 --> 36:18.666
gracious Queen Neera of Darwen,

36:20.166 --> 36:23.666
and good King Midir of Pryshia…

36:27.500 --> 36:33.083
to join with me
as allies in this new dawn.

36:52.416 --> 36:53.583
What's that?

36:58.708 --> 37:00.583
Fire!

37:06.875 --> 37:08.291
Free them!

37:14.541 --> 37:16.250
Go back the way we came!

37:34.166 --> 37:38.041
<i>In that moment,</i>
<i>the Elven world had changed forever.</i>

37:38.125 --> 37:42.708
<i>A thousand years of monarchies,</i>
<i>kingdoms, and clans were erased.</i>

37:42.791 --> 37:43.875
It's done.

37:46.500 --> 37:47.458
Indeed.

37:48.291 --> 37:49.958
My beast has done well.

37:50.041 --> 37:52.083
<i>The peace treaty had allowed Balor</i>

37:52.166 --> 37:55.750
<i>to turn war-hungry mages</i>
<i>and generals against their monarchies.</i>

37:55.833 --> 37:58.250
<i>It was just the beginning.</i>

37:58.333 --> 37:59.375
Empress.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.416
The three kingdoms are yours.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.666
All hail the new Golden Empire.

38:08.250 --> 38:09.083
Rise.

38:09.708 --> 38:11.291
We have much to do.

38:15.041 --> 38:17.000
This storm's unnatural.

38:17.083 --> 38:19.166
We're sailing
for safe harbor in Gaylth.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.708
That's not even close to Xin'trea.

38:21.791 --> 38:24.708
We're no use to our clans
at the bottom of the ocean.

38:41.541 --> 38:43.625
<i>Merwyn was free now.</i>

38:43.708 --> 38:45.666
<i>Free to write her own story.</i>

38:46.166 --> 38:48.708
<i>Just as her hero Solryth had.</i>

38:48.791 --> 38:51.125
<i>To start a new golden era.</i>

38:53.333 --> 38:55.666
<i>This was her destiny.</i>

38:56.375 --> 38:58.375
Empress!

39:05.125 --> 39:06.791
She plays her part well.

39:08.875 --> 39:11.208
A shiny thing to appease the masses.

39:11.875 --> 39:15.375
They all fall so eagerly into place,
despite their world turning on its head.

39:16.416 --> 39:19.708
Faced with chaos,
the people will always choose order.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.250
No matter the cost.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.291
Or how blatant the farce.

39:24.583 --> 39:26.208
How long do we need her?

39:26.291 --> 39:27.458
We shall see.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.041
Take me down to my people.

40:13.625 --> 40:16.333
<i>The skies</i>
<i>and seas were not the only thing</i>

40:16.416 --> 40:18.208
<i>to have changed without warning.</i>

40:19.000 --> 40:20.916
What the fuck are those flags?

40:21.000 --> 40:24.750
-I've never seen that crest before.
-Not Pryshian. That's for sure.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.166
Let's head to this tavern. Get some locals
drunk, find out what's going on.

40:30.250 --> 40:31.875
With what coin, exactly?

40:32.833 --> 40:34.416
Too long on the clan teat.

40:34.916 --> 40:37.041
You need to cultivate
some initiative, boy.

40:37.541 --> 40:38.625
-Oof!
-Sorry.

40:45.958 --> 40:47.041
Come on, then!

40:53.333 --> 40:54.833
Mmm.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.875
At least she ended the war.

41:01.833 --> 41:04.583
Not many'd have the stomach
to kill your own kin.

41:04.666 --> 41:06.333
And her own brother, no less.

41:06.416 --> 41:09.375
-Calling herself Empress Merwyn now.
-Empress?

41:09.458 --> 41:11.500
Wiped out the lot of 'em in one go.

41:11.583 --> 41:14.500
Useless royal bastards
and their poxy clans.

41:15.250 --> 41:16.625
-She killed them all…
-No.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.333
That's impossible.

41:18.416 --> 41:20.625
How does one princess
no one's ever heard of

41:20.708 --> 41:24.250
manage to take the whole Continent
easy as piss like that?

41:24.333 --> 41:28.166
I heard she's got herself
a three-headed beast, the size of a ship.

41:28.666 --> 41:30.125
Sucks on her teat like a babe.

41:30.208 --> 41:31.500
-Beast!

41:33.083 --> 41:34.166
A beast?

41:34.250 --> 41:35.791
Lay off the godhead pipe.

41:39.458 --> 41:40.458
Beast or no,

41:41.500 --> 41:44.708
no Xin'trean bitch is gonna tell me
I'm not Pryshian anymore.

41:47.583 --> 41:49.250
Yeah, you lot are worse.

41:50.125 --> 41:53.500
Paradin' around in your Pryshian armor
mere suns ago.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.750
Traitorous pissants,
dressed in that cunt's armor.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.208
Fuckin' slut's got you lot by the balls!

42:07.791 --> 42:09.458
Anyone seen 'em?

42:10.041 --> 42:13.250
Éile of Raven Clan, Fjall of Dog Clan.

42:24.541 --> 42:26.583
-We need to be smart about this.

42:27.083 --> 42:29.625
If you can't control your fire
because someone insulted your lover,

42:29.708 --> 42:30.750
we should part ways now.

42:30.833 --> 42:34.541
-This has nothing to do with her.
-This has <i>everything </i>to do with her.

42:36.375 --> 42:40.041
She killed our clans.

42:43.208 --> 42:44.458
One! Two!

42:46.625 --> 42:47.958
One! Two!

42:49.791 --> 42:51.041
-One…
-You!

42:51.125 --> 42:52.250
-Oof!

42:52.333 --> 42:54.250
The largest we've excavated yet.

42:54.333 --> 42:56.958
I need more power
to stabilize the gateways.

42:57.041 --> 43:00.875
-How many monoliths have you raised?
-Three in the north, two in the south.

43:01.375 --> 43:04.166
Another five excavated
being configured with Syndril's sigils.

43:04.250 --> 43:07.541
Not enough to power a gateway
for a legion. Why the delay?

43:08.125 --> 43:10.666
Have at you! Pull!

43:10.750 --> 43:11.625
The empire's young.

43:13.541 --> 43:15.458
Our troops are stretched thin.

43:15.541 --> 43:17.750
You absorbed the entire Darwen
and Pryshian army.

43:17.833 --> 43:19.625
How can you be stretched thin?

43:21.125 --> 43:23.333
There were more deserters
than anticipated.

43:25.041 --> 43:27.125
And since your purge of so many mages--

43:27.208 --> 43:28.666
Non-cooperative mages.

43:28.750 --> 43:31.875
Crop failures are worsening.
Bread riots are running rampant--

43:31.958 --> 43:32.958
Then quell them.

43:33.791 --> 43:36.041
Those that make excuses
don't make history.

43:36.125 --> 43:37.625
I said pull!

43:37.708 --> 43:38.916
Pull!

43:42.291 --> 43:44.125
What of Fjall Stoneheart?

43:44.208 --> 43:46.333
He escaped our assassins
on Inis Dubh.

43:46.416 --> 43:49.083
-Along with the Raven Clan warrior.

43:49.166 --> 43:52.250
But we have elite troops
scouring the Continent as we speak.

43:52.333 --> 43:54.875
That's a heroic folktale
waiting to happen.

43:56.250 --> 43:58.000
End them. Now.

44:09.750 --> 44:12.583
Horses are secure. I'll take first watch.

44:14.416 --> 44:16.166
Maybe some of them survived.

44:19.083 --> 44:21.041
My clan would have fought to the death.

44:22.708 --> 44:23.875
So would yours.

44:24.708 --> 44:25.625
A monster.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.791
How can that even exist?
Where did it come from?

44:30.833 --> 44:32.541
There was a mage in Xin'trea.

44:33.375 --> 44:34.208
Syndril.

44:34.291 --> 44:36.875
He dug up and raised
an ancient Dwarven monolith.

44:38.583 --> 44:41.666
He used it to… open up
a gateway to another world.

44:41.750 --> 44:44.208
-The monster came from there?
-I mean, maybe.

44:45.708 --> 44:48.625
-I know it sounds insane.
-There are old stories of other worlds.

44:48.708 --> 44:50.291
And nothing's been right since.

44:50.375 --> 44:52.791
-Even the skies have changed.
-And the seas too.

44:53.500 --> 44:54.541
Everything's off.

44:54.625 --> 44:57.708
But even with the beast,
Merwyn had no power to pull this off.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
There has to be someone else behind this.
The generals, or the mages--

45:02.083 --> 45:03.833
-You're making excuses for her.
-No.

45:04.375 --> 45:08.125
If, now I mean if, she's Empress,
then she was involved.

45:09.291 --> 45:10.916
She'll pay with her blood
for what she did.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.875
I should have died with my clan.

45:14.916 --> 45:15.833
Me too.

45:18.750 --> 45:20.041
We're the last of us.

45:21.833 --> 45:24.291
They'll erase our clans from history.

45:24.375 --> 45:25.750
Not as long as we breathe.

45:26.250 --> 45:28.041
Then we end them before they end us.

45:28.125 --> 45:29.291
Raven Clan.

45:29.791 --> 45:30.958
Dog Clan.

45:31.541 --> 45:32.916
How can we trust each other?

45:35.541 --> 45:36.583
By the blade.

45:43.791 --> 45:44.833
By the blade.

45:57.208 --> 46:01.458
We find Merwyn, end her beast
and anyone who stands with her.

46:06.375 --> 46:07.708
Send them all to clay.

46:09.375 --> 46:10.666
Blood sworn.

46:11.750 --> 46:12.625
To the end.

46:13.291 --> 46:14.208
To the end.

46:15.458 --> 46:17.666
Your brother. How could you?

46:17.750 --> 46:20.666
I'd no choice, Ket.
He'd written my life for me.

46:20.750 --> 46:22.416
I was destined for more.

46:22.500 --> 46:24.625
Old stories are bound to repeat.

46:24.708 --> 46:27.000
They just need
the right person to tell them.

46:27.583 --> 46:30.250
When Solryth died,
we turned on each other.

46:30.333 --> 46:35.208
A great golden era
destroyed by an endless cycle of war.

46:35.291 --> 46:38.041
And one my brother's treaty
would have paused, at best.

46:40.500 --> 46:45.375
Balor and Eredin
want to use Syndril's gateways

46:46.750 --> 46:47.875
to conquer.

46:48.375 --> 46:51.500
But conquest for conquest's sake
means nothing.

46:53.291 --> 46:55.666
I want to civilize these new worlds.

46:57.666 --> 47:01.833
Bring our art,
our science, and culture to them,

47:02.583 --> 47:05.583
and create a new golden era
for all of elfkind.

47:05.666 --> 47:06.583
You th--

47:07.416 --> 47:09.083
You think you're Solryth.

47:10.041 --> 47:11.083
No.

47:13.250 --> 47:14.083
Not yet.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.500
Not while I remain Balor's puppet.

47:20.750 --> 47:23.125
I need to become Empress
in more than just name.

47:23.750 --> 47:28.333
Or all of this,
every drop of blood spilled,

47:28.416 --> 47:29.750
will have been in vain.

47:31.416 --> 47:33.083
I just have to find a way.

47:42.708 --> 47:43.916
What have I done?

47:45.291 --> 47:47.458
You've unlocked the future,
Syndril.

47:50.541 --> 47:53.416
Without your knowledge,
none of this would have been possible.

47:54.291 --> 47:57.625
Now the master monolith is raised,
who knows what worlds await?

47:58.708 --> 48:00.541
Ready your final calculations

48:00.625 --> 48:03.333
to connect the rest of the monoliths
across the empire.

48:07.208 --> 48:08.583
You should be proud.

48:09.750 --> 48:12.916
This new dawn of possibilities
is all thanks to you.

48:24.875 --> 48:27.416
I can't believe
they united the armies.

48:27.500 --> 48:29.791
The closer we get to Xin'trea,
the worse our odds.

48:29.875 --> 48:32.708
Then we change the odds
with the best blade in the land.

48:33.291 --> 48:35.583
-Who?
-My old sword master.

48:35.666 --> 48:37.291
If she doesn't kill me on sight.

48:37.375 --> 48:39.666
She was the one
who introduced me to music.

48:39.750 --> 48:42.791
When I left my clan to become a bard,
she was banished.

48:42.875 --> 48:44.625
Forced to become a sellsword.

48:46.333 --> 48:48.291
You're willing
to risk your throat?

48:48.375 --> 48:50.916
We want vengeance? We need her.

48:52.958 --> 48:54.333
She have a name, then?

48:55.958 --> 48:57.708
This sword mother of yours.

48:59.583 --> 49:00.500
Scían.

49:02.041 --> 49:03.666
Last of the Ghost Tribe.

49:04.166 --> 49:05.583
Ghost Tribe are a myth.

49:06.541 --> 49:07.541
No myth.

49:08.041 --> 49:10.666
Finest sword masters
to ever grace the Continent.

49:11.541 --> 49:13.166
Till you lot wiped them out.

49:13.250 --> 49:15.041
Before my time, then.

49:15.125 --> 49:17.125
When they refused to fight for him,

49:17.208 --> 49:19.458
your King Darach
poisoned their water supply.

49:19.958 --> 49:21.666
Scían was the only survivor.

49:22.375 --> 49:24.750
Our clan found her,
took her in as sword master…

49:24.833 --> 49:25.750
Éile.

49:29.041 --> 49:31.250
Please. We mean you no harm.

49:31.333 --> 49:33.750
What brings you so far
from the main roads?

49:33.833 --> 49:35.166
We fled Bon Machán.

49:35.250 --> 49:38.208
Our mages and elders
refused the new empire.

49:38.291 --> 49:40.083
Her soldiers burnt it to ash,

49:40.166 --> 49:42.875
stole our young
to dig up their black towers.

49:42.958 --> 49:44.083
To raise monoliths.

49:44.750 --> 49:46.875
Why are they raising them
outside Xin'trea?

49:55.083 --> 49:57.000
Are you the Lark?

49:59.791 --> 50:01.291
I don't go by that name anymore.

50:01.375 --> 50:04.083
I saw you last year at the Aedd Gynvael.

50:05.125 --> 50:06.541
You were brilliant.

50:07.333 --> 50:08.583
Those songs,

50:08.666 --> 50:10.041
so full of hope,

50:10.708 --> 50:11.875
made us feel special.

50:12.416 --> 50:14.000
Like the world was ours.

50:14.958 --> 50:17.083
Any chance you could sing
"The Black Rose"?

50:17.666 --> 50:19.125
We could use a bit of hope.

50:24.500 --> 50:25.791
That's enough.

50:26.916 --> 50:27.916
Good luck.

50:38.083 --> 50:41.416
<i>He had heard</i>
<i>that song far south in Xin'trea,</i>

50:41.500 --> 50:43.041
<i>hummed in doorways,</i>

50:43.125 --> 50:47.041
<i>sung in streets and taverns,</i>
<i>always amongst the lowborn.</i>

50:47.541 --> 50:50.083
<i>And now here in the far north.</i>

50:50.166 --> 50:52.833
<i>How could one song have this much power?</i>

50:53.541 --> 50:56.625
We're not far from her.
Tread lightly if you can.

50:56.708 --> 50:58.083
This Scían,

50:59.291 --> 51:00.708
the paranoid type, then?

51:01.916 --> 51:03.750
Her entire tribe was poisoned.

51:04.791 --> 51:05.875
Pit trap.

51:10.250 --> 51:12.166
It's not my first time out, Lark.

51:12.250 --> 51:13.416
I seen it.

51:14.208 --> 51:15.750
And the one 30 paces back.

51:16.916 --> 51:19.000
She'll have to try
a lot harder than that to catch me--

51:20.291 --> 51:23.416
-Fuck's sake.

51:29.541 --> 51:30.958
The clans are gone.

51:32.208 --> 51:33.916
How are you still alive?

51:39.291 --> 51:42.333
<i>I sense the echo of slaughter on you.</i>

51:43.458 --> 51:46.250
<i>The beast I gifted you</i>
<i>gave you what you wanted.</i>

51:46.833 --> 51:47.750
It did.

51:48.791 --> 51:51.583
I've taken control
of the entire Continent.

51:52.166 --> 51:53.375
<i>And yet?</i>

51:53.916 --> 51:54.916
It's not enough.

51:55.583 --> 51:58.208
These people will never accept me
as their emperor.

52:00.625 --> 52:01.958
I'm lowborn.

52:02.041 --> 52:04.208
<i>Interesting…</i>

52:05.125 --> 52:07.666
I need a power that only I can wield.

52:08.625 --> 52:12.000
One that raises me above
any highborn, royal, or army.

52:12.083 --> 52:14.416
<i>You want to be a god amongst elves.</i>

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Yes.

52:18.166 --> 52:21.375
I need… your Chaos magic.

52:22.708 --> 52:25.458
<i>Are you willing</i>
<i>to sacrifice anything for it,</i>

52:25.541 --> 52:27.000
<i>no matter what the cost?</i>

52:27.083 --> 52:28.041
Yes.

52:28.583 --> 52:30.208
Whatever you ask for,

52:30.875 --> 52:32.041
you shall have.

52:38.583 --> 52:41.000
Never thought
you'd darken this place again.

52:43.291 --> 52:45.083
Didn't mean to bring you dishonor.

52:45.833 --> 52:47.000
And yet you did.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.375
The new empress wants you dead.

52:51.458 --> 52:52.625
Why have you come?

52:54.625 --> 52:56.000
To ask for your help.

52:58.416 --> 52:59.458
Come with us.

53:00.458 --> 53:02.166
We're riding to Xin'trea to kill her.

53:04.875 --> 53:08.166
If not for me, then for your ancestors.

53:10.791 --> 53:12.875
Xin'trea stole your tribe's sacred blade.

53:14.416 --> 53:16.625
This is your chance to reclaim Soulreaver.

53:18.791 --> 53:20.458
Who knows where it is now?

53:21.500 --> 53:24.041
Your blade's with the other trophies
in the palace.

53:26.958 --> 53:30.208
Three green stones like that,
and markings on the pommel,

53:30.916 --> 53:32.041
something about…

53:33.500 --> 53:34.750
Black Sands.

53:35.333 --> 53:36.791
Born of Black Sands.

53:37.958 --> 53:39.833
Blade and soul as one.

53:40.541 --> 53:41.875
All beginnings.

53:43.041 --> 53:44.125
All ends.

53:47.916 --> 53:50.166
You'd never get past the city gates.

53:50.250 --> 53:53.625
If you even make it that far
travelling with the enemy.

54:15.375 --> 54:16.500
Ah…

54:21.791 --> 54:22.916
Knitbone.

54:23.875 --> 54:24.750
It'll ease the burn.

54:31.166 --> 54:32.208
Éile.

54:32.750 --> 54:34.541
You can't trust her.

54:34.625 --> 54:36.458
She has an axe to grind with you.

54:36.541 --> 54:40.041
She's got contacts from sellswording
across the land. Contacts we may need.

54:40.125 --> 54:42.541
Contacts she'll use to sell you out
the first chance she gets.

54:43.208 --> 54:44.791
There's no one else left.

54:50.875 --> 54:52.208
Scían's all I've got.

55:02.583 --> 55:04.625
These changing skies
bode a darkness.

55:04.708 --> 55:06.583
We have a chance
if we do it together.

55:06.666 --> 55:08.000
Your quest is hopeless.

55:08.833 --> 55:12.250
-I need you. We need you.
-You have your own path to take.

55:12.333 --> 55:14.666
I can get us past the gates
and into the palace.

55:15.375 --> 55:17.916
There's a secret passage into the city
that's unguarded.

55:20.166 --> 55:21.416
We could use your sword.

55:21.916 --> 55:23.500
No doubt you could.

55:24.250 --> 55:25.125
But…

55:26.125 --> 55:27.833
I won't be going with you.

55:29.666 --> 55:32.791
The only good thing
that's come of all this

55:32.875 --> 55:35.291
is that Dog Clan's gone for good.

55:36.166 --> 55:40.166
And may your father suffer eternity
in a lonely grave.

55:40.250 --> 55:42.833
My father should have finished
King Darach's work.

55:44.166 --> 55:46.083
Put you down with the rest of your tribe.

55:46.166 --> 55:48.666
I would have liked to see him try.

55:48.750 --> 55:51.666
Blindsided by a sweet little princess,

55:51.750 --> 55:55.083
not fit to hold
an axe of a clan chieftain.

56:00.083 --> 56:02.791
-What are you doing?
-He's the one with an axe.

56:03.875 --> 56:06.125
Doesn't seem to know
how to use it, though.

56:09.208 --> 56:10.375
Scían, stop!

56:13.791 --> 56:15.458
You've gotten rusty.

56:15.541 --> 56:16.458
Have I?

56:48.583 --> 56:52.416
Your instincts are good,
but you let your emotions control you.

56:52.500 --> 56:56.291
And you, you have forgotten
how to work as part of a clan.

56:57.666 --> 57:00.000
You're not bad
when you're working together.

57:01.833 --> 57:03.250
We can work with that.

57:04.125 --> 57:05.625
So you're coming with us?

57:08.250 --> 57:09.750
The ancestors will it.

57:15.500 --> 57:17.208
Three against an empire.

57:17.291 --> 57:19.208
Not enough. We need to find more.

57:19.291 --> 57:21.583
Then we'll find others
who want to kill the bitch.

57:21.666 --> 57:23.500
There'll be no coming back.

57:23.583 --> 57:26.125
<i>And so two became three.</i>

57:26.208 --> 57:30.750
<i>The first drops in a torrent</i>
<i>that would change the world forever.</i>
