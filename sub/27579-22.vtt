Clearly, Earth's various teams

00:36.817 --> 00:39.487
[Ultra-Humanite grunts]

00:59.740 --> 01:02.777

<i>And per

[muffled screaming]

[gasps] Slade?

01:26.132 --> 01:28.034
Easy, Princess.

01:28.102 --> 01:29.269
What are you doing?

01:29.337 --> 01:30.739
I could ask you
the same thing.

01:30.805 --> 01:34.108
See, I know you haven't
reported all you know

01:34.174 --> 01:36.543
about either Halo
or Victor Stone.

01:36.611 --> 01:40.811
Explain yourself, girl. Now!

01:43.284 --> 01:46.433
[theme music playing]

02:09.509 --> 02:10.711
[Deathstroke] Nothing to say?

02:10.778 --> 02:12.879
You've gone soft
on those people.

02:12.947 --> 02:13.948
[grunts]

02:14.014 --> 02:15.883
You're soft, Princess!

02:15.950 --> 02:17.485
That's why
those meta-traffickers

02:17.551 --> 02:18.853
were able
to grab you so easily.

02:18.919 --> 02:23.919
But I promise
I can toughen you up.

02:26.894 --> 02:27.929
I am not soft.

02:27.996 --> 02:29.530
I didn't report
on Violet or Victor

02:29.597 --> 02:31.365
because they're both
developing situations.

02:31.431 --> 02:33.433
I'm still gathering intel.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.036
[Deathstroke scoffs]

02:35.103 --> 02:37.906
I can't tell if you're trying
to fool me or yourself.

02:37.973 --> 02:40.040
And I can't decide
which is worse.

02:40.108 --> 02:43.478
You think those heroes
are harmless.

02:43.544 --> 02:46.379
Goody-two-shoes types
who care about you.

02:46.447 --> 02:49.484
You've clearly forgotten
how much Brion cared

02:49.550 --> 02:50.852
when he invited you to London,

02:50.919 --> 02:53.287
then went clubbing while
you were being abducted.

02:53.354 --> 02:54.990
How much your parents cared

02:55.056 --> 02:57.125
when they did next to nothing
to track you down afterwards.

02:57.192 --> 03:01.496
How much Jace cared
when she dunked you
into Bedlam's Tar.

03:01.562 --> 03:03.798
You think your new friends
are any better?

03:03.865 --> 03:06.600
The moment they decide
you're out of line,

03:06.668 --> 03:08.669
the moment they fear
they can't control you,

03:08.735 --> 03:10.471
they'll slap
an inhibitor collar

03:10.538 --> 03:12.340
or a control chip
on your neck.

03:12.406 --> 03:14.909
Look, kid,

03:14.975 --> 03:17.377
have I ever been anything
but straight with you?

03:17.444 --> 03:20.281
Tough, sure.
For your own good.

03:20.348 --> 03:22.349
But straight.

03:22.417 --> 03:26.120
So take this.

03:26.187 --> 03:27.688
Just in case.

03:27.756 --> 03:28.924
-[Dick groaning]
-[EKG beeping]

03:28.990 --> 03:30.657
[Jace]
His temperature's spiking.

03:30.724 --> 03:32.058
Help me strap him down
so he doesn't hurt himself.

03:32.126 --> 03:35.028
[groaning]

03:35.096 --> 03:36.431
I don't understand.

03:36.497 --> 03:38.099
I mean, yeah, Granny's X-Pit
was pure torture,

03:38.165 --> 03:41.102
but I recovered.
Why is Dick in such a bad way?

03:41.168 --> 03:42.437
I wish I knew.

03:42.502 --> 03:44.105
His brain is swelling.

03:44.171 --> 03:46.206
Doctor Jace says we need ice
to bring down his temperature.

03:46.274 --> 03:47.542
-We're on it.
-[Dick groaning]

03:47.609 --> 03:49.342
Ice is on the way.

03:49.409 --> 03:50.645
And then what?

03:50.711 --> 03:53.882
[Dick continues groaning]

03:53.949 --> 03:55.750
<i>It's a fair question,
</i> <i>Courtney.</i>

03:55.817 --> 03:57.651
<i>But the three of us
hope we're making a difference</i>

03:57.718 --> 03:59.354
<i>by inspiring young metas
</i> <i>everywhere.</i>

03:59.420 --> 04:01.455
<i>Showing them that
</i> <i>the possibilities are...</i>

04:01.521 --> 04:03.424
<i>Well, infinite.</i>

04:03.491 --> 04:05.225
Mother of Goat!

04:05.293 --> 04:06.927
This Infinity Incorporated

04:06.995 --> 04:09.230
is poaching on
the Outsiders' turf.

04:09.298 --> 04:12.032
[Garfield] Mmm.
Oh, take it as a compliment.

04:12.098 --> 04:13.033
We inspired them.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.368
They wanna inspire others.
Mmm.

04:15.436 --> 04:16.904
And that's a good thing,
right?

04:16.971 --> 04:20.274
[chuckles] Always looking
on the bright side.

04:20.341 --> 04:21.810
I need that.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.110
Frankly, I'd be lost
without it.

04:24.177 --> 04:28.783
Without you.

04:28.850 --> 04:30.517
Not in a pancake mood?

04:30.584 --> 04:32.620
It is difficult to
enjoy pancakes

04:32.687 --> 04:36.189
when my powers can do nothing
to pull Dick back
from death's door.

04:36.257 --> 04:37.925
[Garfield gulps]

04:37.992 --> 04:39.661
Didn't you just say
she always looked
on the bright side?

04:39.726 --> 04:41.762
I think we all feel
a bit guilty

04:41.829 --> 04:44.732
we're here enjoying a meal
while Dick is so ill.

04:44.798 --> 04:46.201
What else can we do?

04:46.267 --> 04:48.569
Doctor Jace asked us
to give some space

04:48.636 --> 04:50.538
to his oldest
friends and family.

04:50.605 --> 04:51.738
That reminds me.

04:51.805 --> 04:53.608
Who is his family?

04:53.675 --> 04:55.843
Is Grayson's father
Bruce Wayne--

04:55.910 --> 04:57.978
Look, can we
talk about Gretchen?

04:58.045 --> 05:01.649
She's the reason Dick's...
Well, you know.

05:01.716 --> 05:03.718
She almost killed Jeff
and Motherbox too,

05:03.785 --> 05:06.086
using some serious
Apokoliptan tech.

05:06.153 --> 05:08.488
You know she's got
something else cooking.

05:08.555 --> 05:10.458
And I'm not talking
about pancakes.

05:10.524 --> 05:12.560
We need to take her down!

05:12.627 --> 05:14.362
[groaning]

05:14.428 --> 05:17.497
[Jace]
His temperature's down.
He's stable for the moment.

05:17.564 --> 05:18.766
Take a break, Doctor.

05:18.833 --> 05:22.569
We'll call you
if anything changes.

05:22.637 --> 05:24.238
-Coffee?
-[Jace chuckles]

05:24.305 --> 05:25.973
-You're a lifesaver.
-[elevator bell dings]

05:26.040 --> 05:29.476
[Jefferson chuckles]
I think that's your job.

05:29.543 --> 05:31.545
I'm in way over my head, Jeff.

05:31.612 --> 05:33.213
I'm here for you.

05:33.279 --> 05:35.250
Anything you need.

05:35.317 --> 05:37.617
-[stammers] Is everything--
-There's no change.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.153
Alfred's with him.

05:40.221 --> 05:43.690
Kaldur, M'gann. A word.

05:43.757 --> 05:46.694
[sighs] It's a shame
it takes something like this

05:46.761 --> 05:49.062
to bring everyone together.

05:49.129 --> 05:50.930
Yeah.

05:50.997 --> 05:52.632
A shame.

05:52.699 --> 05:54.836
I'm sorry, but I hereby

05:54.903 --> 05:57.038
tender my resignation
to the Justice League.

05:57.105 --> 05:59.406
Since when are we
working for the League?

05:59.473 --> 06:00.807
We're not.

06:00.875 --> 06:04.245
I want nothing to do
with Batman Incorporated.

06:04.312 --> 06:08.949
<i>The truth is,
</i> <i>I don't trust you.</i>

06:09.016 --> 06:10.617
Son of a...

06:10.685 --> 06:12.319
You were all working together!

06:12.387 --> 06:16.055
Mr. "I Don't Join Teams"
Grayson takes me
on a rogue mission

06:16.122 --> 06:17.158
to Granny's house,

06:17.225 --> 06:18.826
where we're rescued
by the co-chair

06:18.892 --> 06:20.961
of the Justice League
and a Bat-Family drone!

06:21.028 --> 06:22.228
-That's on me.
-I can explain.

06:22.295 --> 06:23.663
Oh, I'm sure it is.

06:23.730 --> 06:25.232
And I'm sure you can.

06:25.298 --> 06:27.067
But it doesn't stop there.

06:27.134 --> 06:28.970
Or start there,
for that matter.

06:29.036 --> 06:31.939
That joint op busting
meta-traffickers
around the world?

06:32.005 --> 06:34.175
Dick explained it
all so logically.

06:34.242 --> 06:36.744
It was intel M'gann
provided to us,

06:36.810 --> 06:38.413
to the Team,
and to the League.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.315
But, of course, it was really
the six of you coordinating.

06:41.382 --> 06:43.651
Just how long
have you been coordinating?

06:43.718 --> 06:47.055
When I quit the Justice League
and wouldn't join Batman Inc.?

06:47.122 --> 06:50.658
Did Dick recruit me
for Markovia just to
keep me in the fold?

06:50.725 --> 06:52.860
Holy... When the League split,

06:52.927 --> 06:55.463
Batman didn't
blindside Aquaman!

06:55.529 --> 06:57.064
You both planned it
in advance!

06:57.132 --> 06:58.966
Created that dog and pony show

06:59.033 --> 07:01.869
to lie to every one
of your fellow Leaguers!

07:01.935 --> 07:03.271
And why?

07:03.338 --> 07:05.673
So you could break the law
with impunity

07:05.740 --> 07:07.408
while dragging me into it?

07:07.475 --> 07:09.944
It is not as bad as...
As you make it sound.

07:10.011 --> 07:11.846
Oh, no,
I'm guessing it's worse.

07:11.913 --> 07:13.615
Everything's a lie!

07:13.682 --> 07:16.552
Badass Kaldur getting
his bad ass kicked
in Brooklin, Maine?

07:16.617 --> 07:19.153
That was just to make
the Outsiders look good,
wasn't it?

07:19.221 --> 07:21.122
-[Garfield] No!
-[Brion] That's not
what happened!

07:21.189 --> 07:23.024
-[Jefferson] Not bad enough
you manipulate me...
-[gasps]

07:23.091 --> 07:25.259
-...you had to manipulate
these idealistic kids!
-[sighs]

07:25.326 --> 07:30.326
Be silent, my child,
and follow me.

07:36.103 --> 07:37.302
[grunts]

07:50.451 --> 07:52.086
[Violet] I don't understand.

07:52.153 --> 07:54.654
Should we really
be leaving now,
with Dick in such--

07:54.721 --> 07:58.322
I'll explain in the car.

07:59.793 --> 08:01.661
[gasps] Brion? Tara?

08:01.728 --> 08:02.997
What's going on?

08:03.064 --> 08:04.766
I have good news, Violet.

08:04.831 --> 08:07.634
My mentor has found
a cure for your condition.

08:07.701 --> 08:09.202
My condition?
But they don't--

08:09.269 --> 08:10.605
It's all right.

08:10.670 --> 08:12.005
I know you were having trouble

08:12.072 --> 08:13.673
deciding how to
break the news,

08:13.740 --> 08:15.009
so I told them.

08:15.076 --> 08:17.076
And they're here
to support you.

08:17.144 --> 08:18.379
Right, kids?

08:18.446 --> 08:21.081
[both] Yes, Doctor Jace.

08:21.149 --> 08:23.384
I'm so glad you finally know.

08:23.451 --> 08:25.752
Now there are no more
secrets between us.

08:25.819 --> 08:27.389
-[car engine starts]
-No secrets.

08:27.456 --> 08:31.625
That's my boy.
Seat belts, everyone.

</i> <i>you were kidnapped.</i>

[grunts]

08:36.429 --> 08:37.664
Even with your powers,

08:37.731 --> 08:39.067
you can't seem
to take care of yourself.

08:39.134 --> 08:42.070
Look, kid, I got you away
from your abductors,

08:42.136 --> 08:44.339
which is something your family
and country couldn't do.

08:44.405 --> 08:46.740
-[grunts]
-But we both need to make sure

08:46.807 --> 08:48.676
no one can ever
hurt you like that again.

08:48.743 --> 08:50.745
-So try harder!
-[grunting]

08:50.812 --> 08:55.349
[yells]

08:55.416 --> 08:56.716
We were using bo staffs!

08:56.783 --> 09:00.254
[gasps]

09:00.322 --> 09:03.024
But in this world
it doesn't pay to fight fair.

09:03.091 --> 09:07.861
I'm glad you've learned that.

09:07.928 --> 09:11.828
I'm so proud of you, Tara.

09:13.299 --> 09:14.950
[inaudible]

09:25.346 --> 09:26.813
[Garfield] Didn't we feel
enough of this mode

09:26.880 --> 09:28.783
when Artemis faked her death?

09:28.850 --> 09:31.785
Is this how Batman teaches you
to treat your friends
and teammates?

09:31.852 --> 09:33.653
'Cause I bet
Superman or Wonder Woman

09:33.721 --> 09:34.721
sure wouldn't approve.

09:34.788 --> 09:37.658
Uh... Diana's part of this.

09:37.725 --> 09:39.326
And Cassie doesn't know?

09:39.393 --> 09:40.528
You never told her?

09:40.595 --> 09:43.330
Dude, this is gonna
end you two for good.

09:43.397 --> 09:45.265
You know that, right?

09:45.332 --> 09:48.836
So your little secret society
of superheroes

09:48.903 --> 09:50.871
orchestrated events
in Brooklin, Maine?

09:50.937 --> 09:52.173
No, the Brooklin Warbugs

09:52.240 --> 09:53.875
and the Reach ship
were real threats.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.711
We just kinda teed it up
for you guys.

09:56.778 --> 09:57.879
We didn't need that!

09:57.946 --> 10:00.548
Look what we accomplished
in Dublin!

10:00.615 --> 10:03.451
What? You're saying
Dublin was teed up, too?

10:03.517 --> 10:05.452
But the girl and her dad?

10:05.519 --> 10:08.855
[sighs] The girl was M'gann.

10:08.923 --> 10:10.424
Her dad was Bruce.

10:10.491 --> 10:14.629
[Garfield]
<i>M'gann! You did that to me?</i>

10:14.695 --> 10:16.197
I cannot believe this!

10:16.264 --> 10:17.932
The whole point
of the Outsiders

10:17.999 --> 10:19.267
is to be in the open!

10:19.333 --> 10:20.969
Give kids something
that's theirs.

10:21.034 --> 10:22.236
You guys corrupted that!

10:22.303 --> 10:24.105
Look, you may not
like our methods,

10:24.172 --> 10:27.274
and maybe we did go too far.

10:27.341 --> 10:30.144
But you've secretly
and knowingly
coordinated the Outsiders

10:30.211 --> 10:31.611
with the Team and the League.

10:31.678 --> 10:33.481
-That's different.
-Not very.

10:33.548 --> 10:36.683
You wanted to go head-to-head
with Lex and Granny in public.

10:36.750 --> 10:37.918
We were going head-to-head

10:37.985 --> 10:39.720
with the Light
behind the scenes.

10:39.787 --> 10:41.155
And we did it in a way

10:41.221 --> 10:42.889
that allowed you
to preserve your integrity.

10:42.956 --> 10:45.493
So now you're
mad at us for it?

10:45.558 --> 10:47.961
[sighs] Condiment King?

10:48.028 --> 10:50.097
-[sighs] All yours.
-[door opens]

10:50.164 --> 10:51.533
[Jefferson]
You're not even sorry!

10:51.600 --> 10:53.768
We are sorry we have
made you feel this way.

10:53.835 --> 10:55.437
That's not an apology!

10:55.504 --> 10:58.972
I am not going to apologize
for putting the mission first.

10:59.039 --> 11:00.375
What good is the mission

11:00.442 --> 11:02.976
if we lose ourselves
trying to fulfill it?

11:03.043 --> 11:04.379
[Dick] Jeff.

11:04.446 --> 11:08.349
I think the person
you're really angry with...

11:08.414 --> 11:10.817
is me.

11:10.884 --> 11:13.153
[Jace] My mentor
should be here any minute.

11:13.221 --> 11:14.989
In the meantime, lie down,

11:15.056 --> 11:20.056
and I will prep you
for the procedure.

11:26.333 --> 11:29.769
Wait. I remember... [gasps]

11:29.836 --> 11:32.139
Overlord,

11:32.206 --> 11:35.976
cerebral-leash, please.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.544
[gasps] No!

11:37.610 --> 11:39.947
Don't want-- [groans]

11:40.014 --> 11:43.150
I didn't know
you were bringing a friend.

11:43.217 --> 11:45.419
[Ultra-Humanite]
Friend? [grunts]

11:45.486 --> 11:48.222
Let's call ourselves
associates.

11:48.288 --> 11:49.490
[Ultra-Humanite] I told you

11:49.557 --> 11:52.226
trying to sedate her
wouldn't work.

11:52.293 --> 11:54.162
[chuckles] It was worth a try.

11:54.229 --> 11:55.563
After all, a control chip

11:55.629 --> 11:57.698
might or might not
have worked on this one,

11:57.765 --> 12:00.634
and we couldn't risk
tipping her off beforehand.

12:00.701 --> 12:02.937
I've fulfilled
my part of the bargain.

12:03.004 --> 12:06.106
I'm ready to depart
with Brion and Tara,
as promised.

12:06.173 --> 12:07.774
[Ultra-Humanite]
You'll get what you're owed

12:07.841 --> 12:09.876
when we are good and ready.

12:09.943 --> 12:11.346
[Gretchen] Oh, stop pouting.

12:11.413 --> 12:13.447
So you're not getting
the Halo-Girl.

12:13.514 --> 12:16.951
When the time comes,
you can have the Boomtube-Boy
to play with.

12:17.018 --> 12:18.919
[stammering]
I don't understand.

12:18.985 --> 12:20.288
We had an arrangement.

12:20.355 --> 12:23.091
There's been
a change in plans, my dear.

12:23.157 --> 12:24.658
But don't let it worry you.

12:24.725 --> 12:28.328
I feel a great sympathy
between us, Helga.

12:28.395 --> 12:31.599
You're a mother who knows
how to keep
her children in line.

12:31.664 --> 12:33.634
I admire that.

12:33.701 --> 12:35.001
Would you care to see

12:35.068 --> 12:37.205
what we have planned
for this Motherbox-Girl?

12:37.272 --> 12:39.840
[stammers] I admit,
I'm curious.

12:39.907 --> 12:44.344
Excellent. Motherbox, rise.

12:44.410 --> 12:45.760
Overlord.

12:52.086 --> 12:54.687
What... What is this?

12:54.754 --> 12:56.291
This is an X-Pit.

12:56.356 --> 12:58.091
We're safe within the Cube,

12:58.158 --> 12:59.561
which protects us

12:59.628 --> 13:02.163
from the effects
of the Pit's Ghost Dimension.

13:02.230 --> 13:04.365
Said effects are
somewhat deleterious

13:04.432 --> 13:06.400
to mind, spirit, and body.

13:06.467 --> 13:10.437
In my proper role as matron
of my master's Orphanage,

13:10.504 --> 13:15.176
I hone his young warriors,
and often use X-Pits

13:15.243 --> 13:17.511
for discipline, correction,

13:17.578 --> 13:21.014
and to prepare a subject's
brain for reprogramming.

13:21.081 --> 13:22.950
It's quite effective...
[chuckles]

13:23.017 --> 13:24.219
in the short term.

13:24.284 --> 13:26.120
But only because my children

13:26.187 --> 13:29.224
fear the consequences
of returning to the Pit.

13:29.289 --> 13:31.759
My, uh, dirty little secret

13:31.826 --> 13:35.397
is that the process is flawed
and impermanent.

13:35.462 --> 13:39.234
Free will has not been
truly eliminated.

13:39.299 --> 13:41.134
But after seeing a Motherbox

13:41.201 --> 13:44.172
trapped inside
this organic form,

13:44.239 --> 13:46.341
I formulated a theory...

13:46.408 --> 13:51.211
[Violet grunting
and screaming]

13:51.278 --> 13:52.547
[Gretchen] There. Do you see?

13:52.614 --> 13:55.182
It's a reflex.
She can't help herself.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.451
She's activated
her healing aura,

13:57.519 --> 13:59.754
but it doesn't seem to help.

13:59.821 --> 14:04.821
Overlord, do your readings
confirm my suspicions?

14:06.027 --> 14:07.361
Yes.

14:07.428 --> 14:10.599
The Ghost Dimension
has repolarized the power

14:10.664 --> 14:13.500
emanating from
the Motherbox's human flesh.

14:13.567 --> 14:14.969
[Ultra-Humanite]
Meaning what?

14:15.035 --> 14:16.605
Meaning she's the key

14:16.671 --> 14:21.671
to solving
the Anti-Life Equation.

14:23.577 --> 14:25.879
[Bruce]
I wish Jeff understood.

14:25.947 --> 14:28.249
We were trying to protect him.

14:28.316 --> 14:30.619
We were trying
to protect them all.

14:30.684 --> 14:33.288
I know. But...
But what if we were wrong?

14:33.354 --> 14:35.322
Would you want to be
protected that way?

14:35.389 --> 14:37.591
[Bruce] I wouldn't need to be.

14:37.658 --> 14:40.594
-Well, maybe they
don't either.
-Maybe.

14:40.660 --> 14:41.696
But even the debate

14:41.763 --> 14:43.664
brings the mission
to a grinding halt.

14:43.731 --> 14:46.167
So you just decide
for everyone?

14:46.234 --> 14:48.669
Wow, that's
not patronizing at all.

14:48.736 --> 14:51.072
Barbara, you know
I didn't decide this alone.

14:51.139 --> 14:52.539
The seven of us agreed.

14:52.606 --> 14:54.542
We had to fight fire
with fire.

14:54.609 --> 14:57.711
It's true.
And I'm not absolving myself.

14:57.778 --> 15:00.114
But have you noticed
your little Illuminati society

15:00.181 --> 15:02.017
is made up entirely
of former proteges?

15:02.083 --> 15:05.852
Proteges accustomed
to following your orders
without question.

15:05.919 --> 15:07.755
-Diana--
-Is out in space

15:07.822 --> 15:09.823
where she only
learns of our activities

15:09.889 --> 15:11.125
as a<i>fait accompli.</i>

15:11.192 --> 15:13.193
-The mission--
-Whose mission, Bruce?

15:13.260 --> 15:17.461
The mission or your mission?

15:21.769 --> 15:24.806
What is this
"Anti-Life Equation"?

15:24.873 --> 15:27.375
[chuckles] I'd have thought
that obvious.

15:27.442 --> 15:31.144
Life minus free will
equals Anti-Life,

15:31.211 --> 15:34.815
but the formula
must be tested.

15:34.881 --> 15:39.754
[screaming]

15:39.821 --> 15:44.770
[casting spell
in alien language]

15:45.626 --> 15:47.660
[Ultra-Humanite in English]
What just happened?

15:47.727 --> 15:48.830
Another proof.

15:48.897 --> 15:51.032
Clearly, Motherbox
is still connected

15:51.097 --> 15:52.801
to the Source of all Life,

15:52.868 --> 15:57.371
but without the unfortunate
technological
safeguards Metron

15:57.437 --> 16:00.341
built into all non-organic
Mother and Fatherboxes.

16:00.408 --> 16:03.943
[Ultra-Humanite] So Halo's
organics make her the key

16:04.010 --> 16:06.548
to this "Anti-Life Equation"?

16:06.614 --> 16:10.183
With her connection
to the Source
of Life repolarized?

16:10.250 --> 16:12.352
[squeals] I believe it does.

16:12.419 --> 16:17.057
The Ghost Dimension plus Halo
equals Anti-Life.

16:17.124 --> 16:19.994
But one final test remains.

16:20.061 --> 16:21.395
Do you have truths

16:21.461 --> 16:24.597
you wish to share
with your children, Doctor?

16:24.664 --> 16:26.200
No. I... [groans]

16:26.267 --> 16:31.267
Don't be modest, dear.
Spill your secrets.

16:31.340 --> 16:36.340
[grunting] I...
I only wanted to
protect<i>meine kinder.</i>

16:36.477 --> 16:39.279
For Tara
and Brion are mine.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.649
My creations.

16:41.716 --> 16:43.652
<i>After Bedlam
</i> <i>abducted the princess</i>

16:43.717 --> 16:45.787
<i>and brought her to my lab,</i>

16:45.854 --> 16:49.158
-[Tara]<i>No!
</i> <i>-...I destroyed the old Tara,
</i> <i>drowned her.</i>

16:49.224 --> 16:52.594
<i>What emerged was not
</i> <i>the Markovs' human daughter.</i>

16:52.660 --> 16:57.398
<i>No. Tara was reborn
</i> <i>as a meta-human.</i>

16:57.465 --> 17:00.967
<i>A meta-human
I had brought into this world.</i>

17:01.034 --> 17:02.470
<i>She was now my daughter.</i>

17:02.537 --> 17:03.571
<i>-Tara!
-[Tara]</i> <i>No!</i>

17:03.638 --> 17:05.138
[Jace]<i>But when Baron Bedlam</i>

17:05.205 --> 17:07.008
<i>stole my girl away from me,</i>

17:07.074 --> 17:08.476
<i>I swore revenge upon him,</i>

17:08.542 --> 17:12.579
but need to forge
a new weapon to get it.

17:12.646 --> 17:15.282
Brion is such a sweet boy
at heart,

17:15.349 --> 17:18.051
that manipulating him
was child's play.

17:18.118 --> 17:19.586
I planted seeds,

17:19.653 --> 17:23.191
subtly leading him to beg
to become a meta.

17:23.257 --> 17:24.358
When he had second thoughts...

17:24.424 --> 17:26.060
[Brion]<i>No!</i>

17:26.127 --> 17:27.694
<i>...I took the difficult
</i> <i>decision out of his hands...</i>

17:27.760 --> 17:28.829
[yells]

17:28.896 --> 17:31.766
...and brought my son
into this world.

17:31.833 --> 17:35.135
But the Markovs were
hardly my only subjects.

17:35.202 --> 17:36.570
<i>There was also Gabrielle.</i>

17:36.637 --> 17:38.906
<i>After the King
</i> <i>and Queen's assassination,</i>

17:38.973 --> 17:42.676
<i>DeLamb wanted any potential
</i> <i>witness removed.</i>

17:42.743 --> 17:44.578
<i>Gabrielle was sent to me,</i>

17:44.645 --> 17:46.980
<i>but she tested negative
</i> <i>for the meta-gene.</i>

17:47.048 --> 17:48.817
<i>She was useless.</i>

17:48.884 --> 17:51.085
<i>Bedlam's thug wanted
</i> <i>to shoot her,
</i> <i>right there in my lab.</i>

17:51.152 --> 17:52.988
But that would've made a mess.

17:53.055 --> 17:57.258
<i>So I put her to sleep
with an overdose of morphine.</i>

17:57.325 --> 17:58.759
It was a lovely surprise

17:58.826 --> 18:01.863
to learn you had survived
to become a meta-human.

18:01.930 --> 18:05.333
I reasoned your genetic test
had produced a false negative

18:05.400 --> 18:07.903
and that the morphine
activated your meta-gene.

18:07.969 --> 18:11.137
I believed with all my heart
that Gabrielle had been reborn

18:11.204 --> 18:13.741
as my daughter, Violet.

18:13.807 --> 18:16.611
Just as Brion had been
reborn as my son.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.313
But how was I
to stay near you both,

18:19.380 --> 18:21.949
let alone find Tara?

18:22.016 --> 18:23.417
<i>So I seduced Jeff,</i>

18:23.483 --> 18:27.355
<i>used him to reunite
</i> <i>with my children.</i>

18:27.422 --> 18:29.023
<i>But, after learning the truth</i>

18:29.090 --> 18:31.625
about Gabrielle and the spirit
<i>of the Motherbox within her,</i>

18:31.692 --> 18:35.296
<i>I began to suspect
Violet might not be my child,</i>

18:35.363 --> 18:37.199
<i>my creation at all.</i>

18:37.266 --> 18:40.269
<i>To be certain, I tested
</i> <i>Violet's hair follicles</i>

18:40.335 --> 18:43.771
<i>and discovered
</i> <i>my initial diagnosis
</i> <i>was correct.</i>

18:43.837 --> 18:45.874
<i>Gabrielle never had
</i> <i>the meta-gene.</i>

18:45.941 --> 18:48.509
The girl was some kind
of sick joke,

18:48.576 --> 18:51.311
a corpse revivified
by an alien machine.

18:51.378 --> 18:55.182
And worse, this thing
was dating my son.

18:55.249 --> 18:57.518
I had to separate them.

18:57.585 --> 18:59.688
<i>So I lied,
</i> <i>telling her she was dying.</i>

18:59.755 --> 19:03.857
<i>Even convincing her
</i> <i>not to burden her friends
</i> <i>with her illness.</i>

19:03.924 --> 19:06.193
Anything to keep her
dependent on me

19:06.260 --> 19:11.260
and drive a wedge between
this pretender and my boy.

19:11.932 --> 19:14.935
But I knew this subterfuge
couldn't last.

19:15.002 --> 19:17.505
And now that I was
reunited with my children,

19:17.571 --> 19:20.074
I was impatient
to create more.

19:20.141 --> 19:22.109
I contacted Ultra-Humanite,

19:22.176 --> 19:25.646
and in exchange for delivering
this Motherbox-Girl up to him,

19:25.712 --> 19:27.816
he agreed to arrange our exit

19:27.882 --> 19:30.617
and set us up somewhere
I could continue my work,

19:30.684 --> 19:33.821
increasing the size
of our family.

19:33.887 --> 19:36.023
I'm sorry about
the control chips.

19:36.090 --> 19:38.726
But I couldn't take the chance
of losing you again.

19:38.792 --> 19:42.497
In time, I'm sure they'll
no longer be necessary.

19:42.563 --> 19:44.731
[snickering]

19:44.798 --> 19:48.368
Of that, I am now certain.

19:48.435 --> 19:53.273
Overlord, take us back.

19:53.340 --> 19:56.544
[both gasping]

19:56.611 --> 20:00.480
Ah, secrets can be
such a burden, Helga.

20:00.548 --> 20:01.849
You had to know your words

20:01.916 --> 20:04.652
would make your children
despise you forever,

20:04.719 --> 20:06.820
but you kept right on talking.

20:06.887 --> 20:09.691
I suppose you hate me
for that.

20:09.758 --> 20:12.192
Answer truthfully, now.

20:12.259 --> 20:13.627
Yes.

20:13.694 --> 20:18.031
But would you do
absolutely anything for me?

20:18.098 --> 20:19.433
Yes.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.170
Such is the power
of the Equation.

20:22.237 --> 20:26.107
The Light may keep
its Starro-tech
and control chips.

20:26.173 --> 20:31.173
My Master will have Halo,
and through her, Anti-Life.

20:32.012 --> 20:34.882
[Ultra-Humanite]
You have overplayed your hand.

20:34.949 --> 20:36.651
Mmm. I think not.

20:36.718 --> 20:38.586
[Tara] I think
perhaps you have.

20:38.653 --> 20:40.454
-[Brion grunts]
-[Ultra-Humanite growls]

20:40.520 --> 20:44.258
We will no longer
be controlled.

20:44.325 --> 20:48.462
Take this. Just in case.

20:48.528 --> 20:51.798
[Brion growls]

20:51.865 --> 20:54.101
[yells]

20:54.167 --> 20:56.503
Motherbox, protect.

20:56.570 --> 20:59.141
Violet! No!

20:59.207 --> 21:04.207
-[Jace] Tara! Brion! No!
-[Ultra-Humanite growls]

21:06.314 --> 21:08.263
[Brion gasps]

21:12.653 --> 21:14.588
[Dick] Jeff... [clears throat]

21:14.655 --> 21:15.923
-Please--
-[Jefferson] Stop.

21:15.990 --> 21:19.960
You're not sorry either.
I'm so gone.

21:20.027 --> 21:21.262
Where's Helga?

21:21.329 --> 21:24.332
Uh, she left a while ago
with Violet and the Markovs.

21:24.397 --> 21:26.167
Yeah, I don't blame her.

21:26.233 --> 21:30.203
-Probably didn't want them
to see all this.
-[elevator bell dings]

21:30.270 --> 21:34.770
Where's Violet? Where's Helga?

21:37.444 --> 21:39.980
[wind howling]

21:40.048 --> 21:41.816
[Deathstroke] <i>We went to a lot</i>

21:41.883 --> 21:43.117
<i>of trouble to place
</i> <i>Tara Markov with the heroes.</i>

21:43.184 --> 21:44.417
[Ultra-Humanite]
<i>There was no way</i>

21:44.484 --> 21:46.688
<i>we would honor Jace's terms,</i>

21:46.753 --> 21:48.457
<i>even in trade for Halo.</i>

21:48.523 --> 21:52.160
<i>But Jace didn't,
</i> <i>and still doesn't, know that.</i>

21:52.227 --> 21:55.328
<i>I gave Tara an antidote chip
</i> <i>before Jace could take her,</i>

21:55.395 --> 21:56.865
<i>so that the Markovs'</i>

21:56.931 --> 21:58.366
<i>could believably break free
</i> <i>on their own,</i>

21:58.432 --> 22:01.135
<i>keeping both exactly where
</i> <i>we want them.</i>

22:01.202 --> 22:03.904
[Ultra-Humanite]
<i>That may soon be immaterial.</i>

22:03.971 --> 22:07.409
<i>It's no wonder Darkseid
</i> <i>insisted you give him Halo.</i>

22:07.476 --> 22:11.111
The galactic balance of power
<i>will shift irrevocably</i>

22:11.178 --> 22:12.446
<i>once Granny hands over</i>

22:12.513 --> 22:17.513
<i>this living key
</i> <i>to the Anti-Life Equation.</i>

22:22.123 --> 22:23.590
[Brion]
We have to rescue Violet!

22:23.657 --> 22:26.059
[Tara] But we don't know
where she is.

22:26.125 --> 22:27.161
This can't be true.

22:27.228 --> 22:28.962
I am sorry, but it is.

22:29.029 --> 22:31.031
If my control chip
hadn't malfunctioned,

22:31.098 --> 22:33.433
Brion and I
would never have escaped.

22:33.500 --> 22:37.203
-Helga--
-Jace betrayed you.

22:37.270 --> 22:39.240
Betrayed us all.

22:39.306 --> 22:42.756
I gotta get outta here.

22:45.479 --> 22:50.317
-Jefferson...
-Don't follow me!

22:50.384 --> 22:52.753
[elevator bell dings]

22:52.819 --> 22:55.856
[Gretchen] Here she is,
as promised.

22:55.923 --> 22:59.961
The missing variable
in the Anti-Life Equation.

23:00.028 --> 23:04.265
You'll find her
a very well-behaved child.

23:04.330 --> 23:08.736
Just as I prefer.

23:08.803 --> 23:10.738
[Tara] You were
right about the heroes.

23:10.805 --> 23:13.406
They betray each other
at every turn.

23:13.473 --> 23:15.276
They cannot be trusted.

23:15.342 --> 23:19.842
So, what do you need me to do?

23:21.950 --> 23:24.151
