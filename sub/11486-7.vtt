00:04.160 --> 00:05.673
- Hey, look who's here.
- Hey, Dad.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.353
Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?

00:07.520 --> 00:09.476
Apparently not.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.512
Do you see how rude he is to me?

00:13.720 --> 00:15.312
It's terrible. I'll talk to him.

00:15.480 --> 00:19.234
- I wish you would because... Wait, Alan!
- Oh, oh, sorry.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.908
Alan, have you been badmouthing me?

00:22.560 --> 00:26.109
- Badmouthing you? To whom?
- To Jake.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.912
Oh, to Jake. No.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.632
- Why?
- His attitude towards me is disrespectful.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.950
I have to wonder
where he's getting it from.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.715
I assure you, I make it a point
to speak well of you in front of our son.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.433
What about your brother?

00:41.640 --> 00:43.756
Oh, with Charlie,
I'm completely honest.

00:44.680 --> 00:45.999
That is not what I meant.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.237
I know.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.399
Hey, Judith.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.028
Have you said derogatory things
about me to Jake?

00:53.240 --> 00:55.708
No, why? Did you want me to?

00:58.320 --> 00:59.833
I don't understand his behavior.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.037
Ignoring me, avoiding me,
acting like I'm the enemy.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.629
But you get why I'm doing it, right?

01:07.840 --> 01:09.114
I got it!

01:09.280 --> 01:11.840
I don't know what to say.
He's not getting it from us.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.230
- Absolutely not.
- It's your mother!

01:14.400 --> 01:16.436
- You talk to her.
- No, I talked last time.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.039
- Choose you for it.
- Odds.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.275
One, two, three, shoot.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.873
- Odds. You talk to her.
- No.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.116
- Hey, but you said you were gonna...
- I lied.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.237
Leave a message at the beep. Beep!

01:34.640 --> 01:36.835
I wish there were a better way
to deal with Mom.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.077
There is, but we're both
too pretty for jail.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.318
- What?
- What?

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:15.520 --> 02:17.238
Mom's here.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.753
Charlie, did you hear me?

02:18.920 --> 02:22.071
Yeah, I just prefer to live in denial.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.039
Come on.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.555
We talked about this.
We need to set an example.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.238
Fine, tell Mom I love her and...
I don't wanna give her my cold.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.079
That is not going to help.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.635
Well, you gotta say it in front of Jake.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.357
No. Here is the plan.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.829
We'll stop acting
like we hate being with her...

02:41.000 --> 02:44.913
...stop taking shots at her, and start
acting like we love and respect her.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.478
- All at once?
- Come on.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.116
Your Uncle Charlie thinks
I don't see him...

02:51.800 --> 02:54.678
...but Grandmommy sees everything.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.871
Mom, we didn't expect
to see you today.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.594
I have to come unannounced
because when I call first...

02:59.760 --> 03:02.354
...there's no one home
when I get here.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.279
I imagine that's only because
my cowardly sons are trying to avoid me.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.550
She's ruining the plan.

03:09.720 --> 03:13.156
Well, the important thing is we're
all here, and we're happy to see you.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.949
- Right, Charlie?
- Oh, happy isn't the word.

03:17.120 --> 03:20.396
- So, what's new, Mom?
- Well, if you really care...

03:20.560 --> 03:23.438
- We do, we do.
- We do.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.837
Next Sunday,
I am receiving my gold blazer...

03:27.040 --> 03:29.031
...from the
Westside Realtor's Association.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.037
- I am so proud of you.
- That's great.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.918
Me too, Mom.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.873
It's the highest honor
the real-estate community can bestow.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.432
- I am so proud of you.
- That's great.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.272
Me too, Mom.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.671
So I wanted to talk to you
about the presentation ceremony.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.757
We'll be there.
Tell us where and when.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.236
Well, next Sunday, 5:00.
And I was hoping we could have it here.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.394
- Here?
- Why here?

03:52.560 --> 03:55.836
- I mean, we love and respect you...
- But why here?

03:57.960 --> 04:00.076
This isn't really
a good house for parties.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.073
- Yeah, it's so big and close to the ocean.
- Yeah.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.788
Come on. I can't very well
throw a party for myself.

04:06.960 --> 04:10.475
This way everyone will get to see
how much my sons love and respect me.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.517
Anyway, here is the guest list,
and also a suggested menu.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.473
Nothing fancy. Cocktails, buffet.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.358
Any questions?

04:23.320 --> 04:25.197
- No.
- Good.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.231
Okay.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.518
Big kiss. Love you all.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.715
- Love you too, Mom.
- Bye, Grandma.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.394
Relatives, huh?

04:36.560 --> 04:39.791
Can't live with them,
can't turn them in for the reward.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.595
Excuse me, Berta, but we happen
to love our mother very much.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.512
- Right, Charlie?
- Right.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.591
Jake, look.
There's a pelican on the deck.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.915
Oh, cool.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.918
Are you happy?

04:57.480 --> 05:00.233
Now we have to throw a party
for your crazy-ass mother.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.271
- She's your mother too.
- How do you know?

05:02.440 --> 05:04.032
- I could've been adopted.
- You wish.

05:04.240 --> 05:08.074
I do. Now, what about
this stupid party?

05:08.280 --> 05:10.510
Here. Maybe this'll help.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.075
"Daisy's Fishing Tackle and Live Bait"?

05:16.680 --> 05:18.591
Turn it over.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.069
"Daisy's Classy Catering."

05:21.880 --> 05:25.270
She's my sister. Her husband left.
I'm trying to get her back on her feet.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.074
She runs a catering business
and a bait shop?

05:28.280 --> 05:30.032
Not at the same time.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.314
There's no pelican.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.314
Hey, you Charlie?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.118
Maybe.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.270
- Who's asking?
- I'm Daisy, the caterer.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.159
Your Berta's sister?

05:57.360 --> 05:59.476
Same mom. Dad's a little iffy.

06:00.960 --> 06:04.111
Berta said if I wanted a shot
of your bourbon, I had to ask you.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.918
- Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.

06:10.560 --> 06:14.599
I don't usually drink before noon,
but I'm going through a rough patch.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.917
Well, that's why they make bourbon.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.998
My husband left me for another woman.
You know how I found out?

06:21.200 --> 06:24.272
- To tell you the truth...
- Relax. It's rhetorical.

06:24.440 --> 06:27.637
They waved to me as they drove
my house out of the trailer park.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.478
- That's sad.
- Yeah.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.438
I had that doublewide 11 years.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.879
Larry was with me for four.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.555
Six months of those were house arrest,
so you can't give him credit for that.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.077
You know,
I haven't gotten up to pee yet.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.316
Let me tell you something.

06:49.320 --> 06:52.073
Larry was nothing when I met him.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.678
He was working at some kosher
slaughterhouse out in Fontana...

06:55.840 --> 06:59.515
...before they fired him
for being mean to the cattle.

07:00.440 --> 07:01.793
What?

07:02.320 --> 07:05.517
The Jewish laws dictate that
the animals have to be treated kindly...

07:05.680 --> 07:07.033
...before they get whacked.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.679
Larry would taunt them.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.798
"Hey, hamburger,
guess what's gonna happen to you."

07:18.000 --> 07:20.719
Anyway, I picked him up off his sorry,
unemployed ass.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.633
I gave him hair plugs,
contact lenses, teeth.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.032
The bastard dumped me for this tiny,
little Korean manicurist...

07:28.200 --> 07:31.078
...who huffs nail-polish remover
between appointments.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.873
Well, you give a guy hair and teeth,
he's bound to hook up with trash.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.317
No, she was pretty hot.

07:38.480 --> 07:41.472
She had a spray-on tan,
Botox up the yin-yang.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.790
Couldn't tell if she was 20 or 60.

07:44.680 --> 07:48.514
- Daisy!
- In here!

07:51.840 --> 07:53.398
What the hell are you doing?

07:53.600 --> 07:56.319
Relax. It's not what you think.
We're just having a drink.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.198
Good idea.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.954
You listen to me.
Just because I got us this job...

08:02.120 --> 08:03.997
...doesn't mean
I'm cooking by myself.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.434
I'm coming down there.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.875
And don't act like you're doing me
some big favor.

08:08.040 --> 08:11.271
Oh, excuse me for trying to help
my broke, homeless, baby sister.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.069
I'm not homeless. I have a home.
I just don't know where it's parked.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.357
I wouldn't be broke if you'd have
paid me my share of Mama's estate.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.676
What estate? It was a shoebox...

08:20.840 --> 08:23.638
...full of corn pads,
used lottery tickets and insulin.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.354
It's the first I'm hearing
about the insulin.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.116
Excuse me, but shouldn't we be,
you know...

08:29.280 --> 08:31.191
...cooking something
for my mother's party?

08:31.840 --> 08:33.114
Hang on, Charlie.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.398
You know, I am sick of you insinuating
that I stole all that crap Mama left me.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.751
She didn't leave it to you. You were just
the first one back after she flatlined.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.434
Oh, and where were you?
At some ashram in Oregon?

08:44.600 --> 08:48.479
I was learning from my guru
how to channel my spirit guide.

08:48.680 --> 08:52.070
Oh, please. You were humping
a defrocked priest in the woods.

08:55.560 --> 08:59.189
How about stuffed mushrooms?
Everybody loves those.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.595
You know, that's your problem
your whole life.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.553
You chase after losers,
take care of them, fix them up...

09:04.720 --> 09:07.439
...and then they hop on
the first manicurist out of town.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.909
You're jealous because
I've had love in my life.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.038
Yeah? You know what you got
in your life now? Squat.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.715
No husband, no one to do your nails,
and blocks where your house used to be.

09:16.880 --> 09:20.111
I swear to God. One more word and
I'm gonna knock you on your keister!

09:20.280 --> 09:22.430
- Okay, okay, there's no reason...
- Squat!

09:22.600 --> 09:24.352
- That's it!
- Whoa, whoa, no!

09:24.520 --> 09:28.195
No, whoa! Stop! Berta!

09:29.840 --> 09:31.592
Berta!

09:40.280 --> 09:41.474
Give me the rolling pin.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.880
Is there a special place
you'd like me to put it?

09:46.440 --> 09:49.079
I don't know what else
you want from me. I took you in.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.635
Gunther's in the garage,
so you can have the couch.

09:51.840 --> 09:55.958
You spoil that dog.
Anyway, I'm staying at a motel tonight.

09:56.360 --> 10:00.239
Good idea. Maybe you'll meet
your next husband on the walk there.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.953
- Can I have one of these?
- No.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.714
I am just trying to be a good sister.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.075
No, you're trying
to make me feel like crap.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.753
It's what you always do.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.918
- So I can eat this?
- No.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.511
- Let him have one.
- You don't know this kid.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.070
He never stops at one.
He eats like a refugee.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.031
- Eat it.
- Drop it.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.630
Hey, how's it going?

10:32.640 --> 10:34.312
Not good.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.798
Nice move, Tinkerbell.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.798
- Shut your hole and help me pick this up.
- You pick it up.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.592
I'm going outside to meditate.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.638
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.916
You wanted that clown
to be nice to his mother.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.072
But did you think to say to him,
"Clown, be nice to your mother"?

10:52.240 --> 10:54.470
No, we had to throw a big party
for our mother...

10:54.640 --> 10:57.518
...catered by
the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.949
That's it. I can't work like this.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.479
Well, you have to, Berta.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.835
We've got 50 people coming
in a couple of hours.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.873
- Don't tell me. Tell her.
- Fine.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.029
Watch this.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.953
Hey! I'm meditating here!

11:16.960 --> 11:18.518
Jake, let's go pick up Grandma.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.148
- Charlie, you're in charge.
- The hell I am.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.271
- Why pick her up?
- Grandma likes to drink.

11:23.440 --> 11:27.228
- When grownups drink, they don't drive.
- Good thing Uncle Charlie lives here.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.669
So, good luck. I'll see you tomorrow.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.189
No, wait. Berta, you can't leave.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.876
Don't worry. Your deposit's fully
refundable in fishing tackle or live bait.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.354
I don't want a refund.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.112
I want you to make up with Daisy...

11:42.280 --> 11:45.989
...so when my mother gets here, she'll
have something to eat besides my soul.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.550
Make up with her?
For what? Trying to help her?

11:49.720 --> 11:52.518
Trying to keep her from making
the same stupid mistake again?

11:52.720 --> 11:54.915
Yeah, sure, fine, whatever. Just do it!

11:55.800 --> 11:57.472
No, I'm done with her. I quit.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.633
Berta... Berta, you can't quit being
related to somebody.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.949
Believe me, I've tried.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.512
She is a spoiled, little princess...

12:05.680 --> 12:07.989
...who doesn't know
when somebody's trying to help.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.071
- And you know what else?
- Hold on, hold on.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.676
I'm still trying to wrap
my brain around "little princess."

12:14.280 --> 12:17.158
Ever since Mom spit her out,
she got everything she wanted.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.670
"We don't need to fix Berta's teeth,
Daisy needs singing lessons."

12:20.840 --> 12:22.876
"Why spend money
on a prom dress for Berta...

12:23.040 --> 12:25.429
...when Daisy needs tap shoes?"
- That's rough, but...

12:25.600 --> 12:27.875
"Who cares if Berta needs
her spine straightened?"

12:28.040 --> 12:29.473
"Daisy wants a nose job!"

12:30.600 --> 12:34.593
What if you went ahead and made
a couple dozen of those little egg rolls?

12:34.800 --> 12:37.189
"So what if Berta's got
an extra big toe?"

12:44.560 --> 12:46.994
- Mom?
- Oh, hello, boys.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.069
Why aren't you dressed?
We came to pick you up.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.998
So you can drink.

12:52.680 --> 12:56.309
Oh, yes, well,
I've decided to pass on the party.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.794
What? You can't pass.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.599
We've got people coming,
decorations, caterers.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.394
And that's how you're dressed?

13:03.800 --> 13:05.552
Beats the hell out of a bathrobe.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.955
- Why don't you wanna go to your party?
- Please, it isn't a party.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.317
It's a sham.
None of those people are my friends.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.030
Why would you think that?

13:18.400 --> 13:21.790
Believe it or not, Alan, your mother is
a very sensitive woman...

13:21.960 --> 13:25.873
...and I can feel when people around me
know that I hate them.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.315
Why did you want us
to throw the party?

13:30.520 --> 13:32.192
Oh, why does anyone want a party?

13:32.360 --> 13:34.316
To feel superior
while feigning humility.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.351
Don't touch that, Jake.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.873
Let me tell you something.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.430
The way you treat people
is the way they treat you back.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.629
Miserable bastards.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.793
But putting that aside,
you're getting a gold jacket today...

13:52.000 --> 13:53.956
...and we wanted
to share that with you.

13:54.120 --> 13:59.035
Is that what it takes? I have to win an
award for my sons to notice I'm alive?

14:00.120 --> 14:04.193
Okay, you know what?
Go, don't go. I don't care.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.154
If you wanna sit here
and stew in the venom and bile...

14:08.320 --> 14:11.710
...that is the soup of your being,
then fine. I hope you drown in it.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.673
Don't you ever talk
to your mother this way.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.953
Forget the party.
I'll go back and tell those people...

14:18.120 --> 14:21.669
...that the guest of honor could not
be bothered to show up.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.474
- Come on, Jake.
- Oh, dear Lord.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.074
Alan, wait.

14:27.520 --> 14:32.640
If this silly, little party
means that much to you, I'll go.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.597
Just let me get dressed.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.678
Oh, gee. Thanks, Mom.

14:39.920 --> 14:44.118
God, I hate being guilted
into doing things.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.836
And after all that, the loans,
the bail, the kidney I gave her...

14:49.000 --> 14:52.629
...which even though it wasn't mine,
was still money out of pocket...

14:52.840 --> 14:54.751
...did she appreciate my sacrifices?

14:55.360 --> 14:56.793
I'm guessing no.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.276
She threw them away on chasing
after men with drinking problems...

15:00.440 --> 15:03.512
...men with gambling problems,
men with wooden legs and glass eyes.

15:03.680 --> 15:04.874
You wanna know why?

15:06.800 --> 15:08.791
Spare parts?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.479
Low self-esteem.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.992
I remember
when we were little girls...

15:14.160 --> 15:16.310
...she had this crush
on our cousin Jimmy...

15:16.480 --> 15:20.268
- He wasn't really our cousin. He was...
- Stop, please! Enough.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.555
If you won't talk to her, I will.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.758
Finally. I was running out of stories.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.953
Daisy?

15:34.200 --> 15:35.713
Can I talk to you for a minute?

15:38.040 --> 15:41.077
Daisy is no longer inhabiting
this earthly vessel.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.034
Excuse me?

15:45.600 --> 15:49.149
I am Oxyquatzal,
warrior priestess of the Aztec people.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.034
Okay.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.878
Let me ask you something.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.476
Do you know how to make
those little hot dogs wrapped in pastry?

15:59.200 --> 16:01.668
Listen carefully.
I have a message for Daisy.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.400
- Really?
- She's wandered off the path of destiny.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.993
She must return.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.398
Alrighty, is there a number
where she can reach you?

16:09.840 --> 16:11.512
Tell her to follow her bliss...

16:11.680 --> 16:14.148
...to stop squandering
the gifts of the Great Spirit.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.792
- Got it.
- Do you need to write that down?

16:18.960 --> 16:21.793
No, I got it. Path, bliss, spirit.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.390
- Great Spirit.
- Sorry. "Great Spirit."

16:25.560 --> 16:28.677
- Anything else?
- No, that's it.

16:34.920 --> 16:38.515
- What do you want?
- You're screwing with me, right?

16:38.720 --> 16:42.599
Get out of here.
I'm trying to channel my spirit guide.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.199
OxyContin?

16:45.920 --> 16:47.638
Oxyquatzal. How do
you know about her?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.228
Oh, boy.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.158
Berta!

16:52.560 --> 16:55.233
Was Oxyquatzal here?
What did she say?

16:57.360 --> 16:59.635
She said that the guests
are gonna be here soon...

16:59.800 --> 17:03.349
...so you should make up
with your sister and finish cooking.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.117
No, she didn't.

17:05.319 --> 17:06.992
How do you know?

17:07.200 --> 17:11.159
Oxyquatzal is a 500-year-old
Aztec warrior.

17:11.319 --> 17:14.232
Do you think she really cares
about your dumb-ass party?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.789
Everybody likes a party.

17:17.319 --> 17:18.958
What did she really say, Chachi?

17:20.280 --> 17:24.751
She said that you have strayed from
your path and to follow your bliss...

17:24.920 --> 17:27.559
...which is catering, right?
- No, I never liked catering.

17:27.720 --> 17:31.156
I only got into it because the bait
business was so damn competitive.

17:31.840 --> 17:32.989
What else?

17:34.840 --> 17:38.355
Something about squandering
the gifts of the Great Spirit.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.711
Oh, man, that is heavy.

17:41.880 --> 17:45.395
For an ancient chick,
she is so spot on.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.873
Well, no sense crying over
squandered gifts.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.678
What do you say
we go to the kitchen?

17:50.840 --> 17:55.277
What's the point?
My life is hopeless. My dreams are dead.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.510
Yeah, but what if they weren't?

17:59.280 --> 18:01.111
- What do you mean?
- Oh, I don't know.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.748
What if there was some way
I could help you?

18:04.400 --> 18:07.312
You think you could whip up
some rumaki then?

18:07.800 --> 18:09.836
You don't even know
what my dreams are.

18:10.040 --> 18:13.191
Oh, come on. Work with me, baby.
I don't even know what rumaki is!

18:15.840 --> 18:18.912
Oh, gosh, Alan,
I don't know about this.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.759
- Is my hair all right?
- Mom, your hair looks perfect.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.514
You're impeccably dressed,
you're fashionably late...

18:24.680 --> 18:26.432
...and everybody is waiting for you.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.990
So, now, come on, let's walk in there
and rub their noses in your success.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.952
Well, all right.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.834
- Alan.
- What?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.077
You're blocking me.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.837
Rumaki?

19:10.280 --> 19:14.193
I will never, ever forgive you for this.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.919
One thing. One lousy thing I ask
from my sons, and this is what I get.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.912
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.995
Not only was I roundly ignored
at my own party...

19:32.160 --> 19:34.549
...but I listened
to a disturbed caterer belt out...

19:34.720 --> 19:36.756
...the entire score
of <i>La Cage aux Folles.</i>

19:38.200 --> 19:39.428
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.232
You should be sorry.

19:41.640 --> 19:42.914
We are.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.439
Then say it.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.076
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.395
Hello?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.797
Jake, honey, ready to go home?

19:51.200 --> 19:55.193
Mom, you're here. I love you.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.476
Wonderful. Teach him sarcasm.
Thank you very much.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.878
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
