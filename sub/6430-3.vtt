this realm.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.348
I will destroy everyone you love.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.060
- Uh-oh.
- What's the matter?

39:56.269 --> 39:58.145
- Why "uh-oh"?
- He changed the signature.

39:58.354 --> 40:00.147
- Meaning what?
- It's a different layout.

40:00.356 --> 40:01.398
I have to reverse it.

40:01.608 --> 40:04.485
- Aargh! I need the Farnsworth blueprints.
- No, they're locked in tech.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.446
- I was just taking a gander at them.
- Well, I've got them.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.157
Here. I mean,
I read them this morning.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.159
Photographic memory, me too. It's not--

40:12.368 --> 40:13.911
- Who's this guy?
- Later. Farnsworth.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.162
Okay.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.874
Imagine five of these, okay?
Staggered diagonally.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.210
This section right here inverted.
How do I...?

40:21.419 --> 40:25.506
You put that one there
and then you run this to there.

40:25.715 --> 40:27.883
Right. Because that would connect
those two.

40:28.093 --> 40:31.553
Way too many forms
and I have created a few more myself....

40:31.763 --> 40:33.806
- Uh-oh.
- What's the matter?

40:34.015 --> 40:35.516
I don't have a fusible link.

40:35.725 --> 40:37.351
What's fusible? Maybe I have it.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.685
- Car battery.
- The Camino.

40:38.895 --> 40:41.814
DOOMSDAY:
Make your life better. Yours....

40:42.023 --> 40:43.065
Up.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.526
Hurry up, guys.

40:45.735 --> 40:50.405
Are they to be removed, erased,
eradicated? Yes. Yes, of course.

40:50.615 --> 40:54.034
- Okay, he's almost out of dialogue.
PETE: It's the countdown.

40:54.244 --> 40:55.452
Okay, here it is!

40:55.662 --> 40:58.080
- Come on, I need that wire,
- Make the connection.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.376
You have made me do this.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.878
- Do something.
- What's happening?

41:05.088 --> 41:09.258
- We connected a blue wire.
- I have become...

41:09.467 --> 41:11.009
...death.

41:11.219 --> 41:12.928
[♪♪♪]

41:14.139 --> 41:16.765
[PROJECTOR POWERS UP
THEN WHIRRING]

41:19.144 --> 41:20.185
Ah-ha!

41:21.271 --> 41:22.479
Ha-ha-ha!

41:22.981 --> 41:26.316
Claudia, I-- Good job.

41:27.360 --> 41:30.612
Any chance that went out to the entire
Raymond St. James fan club?

41:31.030 --> 41:32.072
Ha-ha-ha!

41:32.282 --> 41:34.992
BRENDA: I gave up Raymond St. James
for this?

41:43.459 --> 41:46.712
So that's how the power's generated. Huh.

41:46.921 --> 41:51.175
If I spent time with this thing, I could rig it
so it don't need to recharge.

41:51.384 --> 41:55.012
Maybe you should hold off
on mentioning that to Artie.

41:56.181 --> 42:00.267
- Good thought.
- So, Claudia....

42:00.476 --> 42:02.019
That's a scary tone.

42:02.896 --> 42:04.688
- Todd's cute.
- Todd who?

42:04.898 --> 42:06.398
Hmm?

42:06.941 --> 42:08.400
This is me ignoring you.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.527
Ha-ha-ha.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.197
- I smell popcorn.
- Hey-oh!

42:14.324 --> 42:18.493
Who wants to watch I Return To Kill
starring our new favourite actor?

42:18.703 --> 42:19.995
You have got to be kidding.

42:20.205 --> 42:23.999
Yeah, I think I've seen enough of that
dude's movies to last me a lifetime.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.793
Wussies. In my room in five. Okay?

42:27.003 --> 42:29.796
Remember, I have a big flat screen.

42:32.091 --> 42:34.468
Well, item 186...

42:35.220 --> 42:37.763
...Farnsworth parts A and B
are right back where they--

42:37.972 --> 42:41.225
- Ooh. Popcorn, deal me in. Mm-hmm.
- How else do you watch movies?

42:41.434 --> 42:43.894
You know,
if we want any of that popcorn....

42:45.897 --> 42:49.358
- So about Todd--
- Hey, wait up.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.194
MYKA: So he's really cute.
- I might have to cut you...

42:52.403 --> 42:54.947
- ...you can't be trusted about it.
- I was just thinking maybe....

42:55.156 --> 42:56.573
CLAUDIA:
Myka, no. The answer is no.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.408
[♪♪♪]

43:05.375 --> 43:09.711
VALDA: He may have left
something behind, an echo.
