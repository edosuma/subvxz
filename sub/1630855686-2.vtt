WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:09.260
<i>Something is coming,
and we're not ready for it.</i>

00:09.260 --> 00:10.511
Egwene is stronger
than most.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.514
But you have ten times
that power, Nynaeve.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.559
<i>I want to see you
become so powerful that no man</i>

00:16.559 --> 00:18.644
will ever be able
to take that away from you.

00:18.644 --> 00:20.896
I haven't touched that dagger
in six months.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.356
I am not a threat to you.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.941
<i>Naivety doesn't suit you.</i>

00:23.941 --> 00:25.443
I know about the man
you meet in Northharbor.

00:25.443 --> 00:28.696
Walk away, or I will tell
your Red Sisters where he lives.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.990
<i>I know very little
about this sniffer</i>

00:30.990 --> 00:32.199
<i>Lord Ingtar's hired.</i>

00:33.409 --> 00:35.786
There's a rage inside of me.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.079
The whole dial was covered
in a poem

00:37.079 --> 00:38.330
when they found it,
written in blood.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.332
<i>The bond
made things easier.</i>

00:40.332 --> 00:42.418
<i>It was like a friend chatting
away so we never had to,</i>

00:42.418 --> 00:43.753
<i>and now, silence.</i>

00:47.882 --> 00:49.842
What aren't you telling me?

00:49.842 --> 00:51.510
What do you see now?

00:51.510 --> 00:52.887
The Eye of the World?

00:52.887 --> 00:54.972
Wish I didn't.

00:54.972 --> 00:55.973
<i>It's true, isn't it...
what they say</i>

00:55.973 --> 00:57.516
<i>about men who can channel?</i>

00:57.516 --> 00:59.059
<i>That eventually, they go so mad,</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:00.186
<i>they kill everyone
they've ever loved?</i>

01:00.186 --> 01:01.187
It is.

01:01.187 --> 01:02.271
<i>Tell them I died here.</i>

01:03.272 --> 01:04.648
<i>Tell them I didn't make it back.</i>

01:20.623 --> 01:22.500
<i>No!</i>

01:34.136 --> 01:35.679
Rand?

01:37.056 --> 01:38.390
Another nightmare?

02:00.246 --> 02:02.748
No. I should get to work.

02:02.748 --> 02:06.836
You still owe me
room and board for this month.

02:06.836 --> 02:10.256
Don't be late. I'll have
to charge you interest.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.469
I won't be.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.932
Your rates are too steep for me.

02:21.976 --> 02:25.187
All these nights together,
and it's always the same ending.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.724
Here, son.

03:05.561 --> 03:08.772
Hey, here, friend.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.213
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

04:14.213 --> 04:17.967
<i>You are mine, Rand al'Thor.</i>

04:46.912 --> 04:50.082
Ah. Lan.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.461
You sure
you don't need more Healing?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.130
I'm fine.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.756
I'll get you
some water.

04:57.756 --> 05:00.092
You're in luck.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.303
My Sister and I have decided
to accompany you.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.311
I assume you'll head
to the White Tower first?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.188
I have been exiled
from the Tower.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.232
I know.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.014
Wait.

05:48.223 --> 05:51.268
We need to leave if I'm to make
it to the docks before sunset.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.772
I've lost too much time already.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.733
Where exactly are we headed?

05:57.733 --> 05:59.443
The White Tower.

05:59.443 --> 06:02.529
- You can't...
- Have Tomas ready my horse.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.615
You're still weak
from the Healing.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.368
And I don't want
my saddle to slip.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.013
We certainly won't
bloody well catch 'em

06:28.013 --> 06:31.558
if the goat-licking bastard
refuses to ride a horse.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.811
Tracking's not easy
to do from horseback.

06:33.811 --> 06:37.106
He's just sniffing the bloody
air. It's not proper tracking.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.358
Well, he's kept us
on Fain's trail.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.400
Quiet.

06:55.124 --> 06:56.875
They crossed here.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.380
Something doesn't feel right.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.926
Let's go over.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.512
Wherever we can find
a crossing.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.472
Builder, you stay
with the horses.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.974
- As you wish.
- Oh.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.943
Split up,
search the grounds.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.820
This could be
a Darkfriend safe house.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.519
There's a woman.
In that house.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.463
Sorry. We were worried
that you might...

09:03.168 --> 09:05.629
This is where it happened.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.590
- Light.
- Perrin? Perrin, you all right?

09:12.594 --> 09:14.805
There's nobody in here.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.515
Let's go.

09:18.517 --> 09:21.270
Useful...

09:21.270 --> 09:25.315
to know the difference
between vision and reality.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.402
You don't get lost so easily.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.825
Whatever you're doing to me,

09:34.825 --> 09:36.785
I want no part of it.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.871
Doesn't work that way.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.005
Seems Fain and
his friends left in a hurry.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.550
Probably felt us
breathing down their necks.

09:51.550 --> 09:55.262
Whatever scared them away,
it wasn't us.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.889
There's something
you need to see.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.519
He was alive when they did this.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.521
When they started, at least.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.822
What could do this
to a Fade?

10:15.574 --> 10:17.075
I don't know.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.494
You think it was Padan Fain?

10:25.334 --> 10:27.836
Back to the horses.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.172
We'll stay in that village
by the river tonight.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.972
No! No!

10:38.972 --> 10:41.099
Aielman!

10:41.099 --> 10:43.769
My blade. Where is it?

10:43.769 --> 10:45.145
Hurry, someone!

10:45.145 --> 10:47.356
The Aiel have breached the wall!

10:47.356 --> 10:50.359
- It's just me, Errol.
- How do you know my name?

10:50.359 --> 10:52.319
How did you get past
the guards?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.654
The guards let me in,
like they do every day.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.950
The Aiel War is over, my friend.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.244
Twenty years now.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.747
Want to go for a walk?

11:03.747 --> 11:07.209
We've met before, eh?

11:07.209 --> 11:08.752
We have.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.213
This isn't some dirty trick?

11:11.213 --> 11:13.673
No. I wouldn't dream of it.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.477
Never thought I'd see the day.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.688
Aielmen among us.

11:29.731 --> 11:33.110
Nobody bats a bloody eyelash
in the whole place.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.614
Coming to take me for a walk.

11:37.614 --> 11:41.284
We get to start fresh every day.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.790
But we always manage.

11:48.834 --> 11:49.960
Don't we?

12:04.099 --> 12:06.017
Vicious fighters, you lot.

12:06.017 --> 12:11.606
I saw one cut down
a whole brigade on his own.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.485
- And your women...
- Even fiercer?

12:15.485 --> 12:17.612
- Even fiercer.
- Oh.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.448
I'm amazed you survived.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.867
Don't test me, boy.

12:21.867 --> 12:25.745
Once a blademaster,
always a blademaster.

12:27.205 --> 12:30.292
Even if I have misplaced
my heron-mark sword.

12:30.292 --> 12:34.463
I'll try to sneak
my sword in again sometime.

12:34.463 --> 12:37.382
You can teach me
a few more forms, right?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.427
Take your pick.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.389
Cutting the Clouds,

12:44.389 --> 12:46.725
Kissing the Adder...

12:51.438 --> 12:53.940
Just like the glory days,
right, old man?

12:53.940 --> 12:56.067
- Get out of here.
- Now, come on.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.611
He's easy to wind up, that one.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.238
Always good for a laugh.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.949
You're going to wind up the
wrong person one of these days.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.743
Who? You?

13:04.743 --> 13:07.370
You clean up old man shite
all day every day.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.080
At least in the garden here,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.833
I get to see some
of the more famous residents.

13:11.833 --> 13:15.504
Well, and the sun.

13:22.636 --> 13:26.848
Hey.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.269
That bastard.

13:31.269 --> 13:34.231
He caught us by surprise.

13:34.231 --> 13:37.901
Next time,
we'll be ready for him.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.445
Now, what'll you hit him with
first?

13:44.407 --> 13:46.326
Parting the Silk

13:46.326 --> 13:49.663
to put him off balance.

13:49.663 --> 13:54.501
Then Reaping the Barley,
before he can right himself.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.170
Straight to the heart.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.924
Pretty vicious yourself,
old man.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.978
Where's Nynaeve?

14:12.978 --> 14:15.021
Liandrin Sedai herself
came in and took her.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.982
Took her where?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.244
Breakbone fever.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.872
Begging your pardon, Aes Sedai.
Would you?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.792
Oh, proceed, child.
We wish only to observe.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.335
Crimsonthorn root.

14:37.335 --> 14:40.130
- You aren't going to...
- Of course she's not.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.258
Breakbone may be a death
sentence where you come from,

14:43.258 --> 14:44.884
but here, it's easily healed.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.763
We dilute the crimsonthorn.
Takes the edge off the pain.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.557
But the Healing is still
quite uncomfortable.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.143
Maybe you could hold her hand
while I do this?

15:37.437 --> 15:38.980
That was incredible.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.525
Took a lot of practice.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.743
Come.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.833
<i>When you become
Accepted, like that young woman,</i>

15:58.833 --> 16:00.377
you learn from each of the Ajahs

16:00.377 --> 16:02.462
about their speciality,
their purpose:

16:02.462 --> 16:04.714
exploring our Great Library
with the Browns,

16:04.714 --> 16:06.299
learning statecraft
and diplomacy

16:06.299 --> 16:08.134
from the... from the Grays.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.720
And when you come here,
the Yellow Sisters teach you

16:10.720 --> 16:13.014
that Healing... it's a response

16:13.014 --> 16:15.642
to the symptoms and disease
you are presented with.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.477
But my Ajah?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.938
We stop the disease
taking root in the first place.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.817
Men who can channel
are not a disease.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.113
I grew up
in a small village, too.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.781
When I came here,
it took a long time

16:29.781 --> 16:31.449
for me to wrap my head
around the idea

16:31.449 --> 16:35.453
that saving one girl's life,
great that may be... it pales

16:35.453 --> 16:37.872
in comparison
to what I actually could do.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.834
Using the One Power...
it slows the aging process,

16:40.834 --> 16:43.044
lets Aes Sedai live
for hundreds of years.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.963
We can do more than just react.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.632
We can change the course
of history itself.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.427
I could make sure
that countless girls

16:50.427 --> 16:54.222
I'll never even meet don't need
to be saved in the first place.

16:57.308 --> 17:00.103
I've asked
the Mistress of Novices

17:00.103 --> 17:01.980
to turn your studies over to me.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.941
I heard you're not allowed
to teach novices.

17:04.941 --> 17:08.278
You've heard of the Arches?

17:10.321 --> 17:13.283
The trial novices go through
to become Accepted?

17:13.283 --> 17:15.285
When my Sisters ask you
if you're ready,

17:15.285 --> 17:17.287
I suggest you say "yes."

17:18.329 --> 17:20.999
Then our work can begin.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.917
I'm allowed
to teach Accepted.

17:22.917 --> 17:25.253
Sweetcakes,
Aes Sedai?

17:30.091 --> 17:31.342
Thank you.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.074
You should at least knock.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.493
I might have been naked.

17:56.493 --> 17:59.329
Oh, my heart flutters
at the thought.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.918
Are those for me?

18:04.918 --> 18:08.129
Sweetcakes.
I'm feeling generous.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.924
- Are they... poisoned?
- If I wanted you dead, boy,

18:10.924 --> 18:12.675
I could think
of far more creative options.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.400
What do you want from me, then?

18:29.400 --> 18:33.112
We're merely observing to make
sure the effects of the dagger

18:33.112 --> 18:35.281
from Shadar Logoth have fully
passed from your system.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.117
That why you locked
that door behind you?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.787
Enjoy the sweetcakes, Mat.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.695
Oh, you can leave those right
there. Thank you so much.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.407
Would you mind not
blocking my door?

19:59.407 --> 20:01.576
Oh, are you a novice, too?

20:01.576 --> 20:02.994
I was starting
to think they'd put me

20:02.994 --> 20:04.579
in a different section
of the Tower.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.581
I haven't seen another soul here
since I arrived.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.666
The day starts early
around here.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.127
And, yes, I am, but I would
appreciate it if you...

20:11.127 --> 20:13.087
Will you show me how you've done
your room, will you?

20:13.087 --> 20:15.131
It's just, with this tiny space,
it's just impossible.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.674
I've seen closets
that are bigger.

20:19.052 --> 20:22.013
- Oh, so you've
just moved in, too.
- Uh...

20:22.013 --> 20:24.390
Oh, I'm so grateful I'm not
the only one starting today.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.392
You really think
they'd do a better job

20:26.392 --> 20:28.853
at cleaning up before
we arrive, don't you think?

20:28.853 --> 20:30.605
Mine was full of rubbish, too.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.317
Oh.

20:34.317 --> 20:36.945
No. I see. Um,

20:36.945 --> 20:38.988
you didn't just move in.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.574
I did not.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.746
This is lovely stitching.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.290
- Um...
- It's Western Andoran,
isn't it?

20:49.290 --> 20:51.501
The Two Rivers?

20:52.919 --> 20:54.504
Um...

20:55.797 --> 20:57.966
Why are you smiling like that?

20:57.966 --> 20:59.676
Um, it's just, um,

20:59.676 --> 21:01.469
I'm so pleased.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.262
I-I never thought that
the Tower would let me live

21:03.262 --> 21:04.847
with the rest of the novices.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.474
Why wouldn't you live
with the rest of us?

21:06.474 --> 21:10.436
Oh, you know,
the whole "Daughter-Heir" thing.

21:15.525 --> 21:18.403
I'm Elayne Trakand...

21:18.403 --> 21:22.490
Daughter-Heir of... Andor?

21:24.492 --> 21:28.121
You're my, uh... subject.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.333
I'm Egwene al'Vere.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.335
Well, it's lovely
to meet you, Egwene.

21:34.335 --> 21:37.588
You know, they say

21:37.588 --> 21:39.090
that some
of the greatest pairings

21:39.090 --> 21:40.591
in the history
of the world were formed

21:40.591 --> 21:42.468
between novices
in adjacent rooms.

21:42.468 --> 21:46.014
Cadsuane Melaidhrin and
Elena Katab met just like this.

21:46.014 --> 21:50.059
Don't you wonder what the future
might hold for us?

21:57.608 --> 21:59.777
Arinvar couldn't join you?

21:59.777 --> 22:01.738
Uh...

22:03.114 --> 22:05.533
There are some things
best left between Sisters.

22:10.872 --> 22:13.249
What Liandrin's proposing
is just too dangerous.

22:13.249 --> 22:16.377
Last week, she wasn't even
allowed near a novice.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.796
And now she wants Nynaeve
to go through the Arches?

22:18.796 --> 22:21.632
Nynaeve is the most
powerful channeler this Tower

22:21.632 --> 22:23.801
- has seen in...
- A thousand years. Yes.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.553
Everyone keeps saying that.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.638
She still can't embrace
the Source unless

22:27.638 --> 22:29.724
she's angry or afraid,

22:29.724 --> 22:31.517
- and barely even then.
- She could die

22:31.517 --> 22:33.770
in the Arches.
Many have before her.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.605
Oh, perhaps.

22:35.605 --> 22:37.857
- Doubtful, with her power.
- Do you know why

22:37.857 --> 22:40.234
these women and men are
being born now, Sister?

22:40.234 --> 22:42.945
With so much more power
than we've ever seen?

22:42.945 --> 22:47.700
Not just Nynaeve, but Egwene
and the Daughter-Heir, too.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.578
And the false Dragons.
Logain, Mazrim Taim.

22:50.578 --> 22:53.164
The Pattern's
giving us weapons.

22:53.164 --> 22:55.374
To fight against him.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.921
The Last Battle is near, Sister.

23:05.760 --> 23:09.639
And would you not have Nynaeve
at our side... fighting it?

23:09.639 --> 23:11.974
You're the Mistress of Novices.

23:13.643 --> 23:15.770
You're responsible
for these girls.

23:18.856 --> 23:23.111
Liandrin's little cabal
have called for a vote, Alanna.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.822
And, unfortunately, in the Hall,

23:25.822 --> 23:29.575
you speak as one, not three.

23:34.455 --> 23:38.626
That is, if you intend
to be here to speak at all.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.427
Do you want to stay?

23:48.427 --> 23:51.347
No. Moiraine...

23:51.347 --> 23:54.433
She needs us.

24:03.526 --> 24:05.570
Ah, good.
Did you come to help?

24:05.570 --> 24:08.823
No. Liandrin had told me
I could come by.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.158
Is she...?

24:10.158 --> 24:11.742
Liandrin Sedai just left.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.244
If you hurry,
perhaps you can catch her.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.001
We'll spend the night here.

25:44.001 --> 25:47.964
Find out if anyone's seen Fain,
or whatever killed that Fade.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.569
Light, the smell.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.613
Tastes better than it smells.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.448
Go in.

26:14.448 --> 26:15.992
The first plate's on the house.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.954
- Go, go, go, go! Go in!
- Mm.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.799
<i>We need drink,</i>

26:31.799 --> 26:35.052
not some rank devil fish.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.179
I actually
quite like lionfish.

26:37.179 --> 26:40.057
There's a certain depth
of flavor to the fermentation

26:40.057 --> 26:42.018
that makes it quite delicious.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.020
Why am I not surprised?

26:44.020 --> 26:45.855
Aren't you coming?

26:45.855 --> 26:49.442
I prefer to sleep
under the stars.

26:49.442 --> 26:52.445
Suit yourself.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.864
They're not your pack,
you know.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.949
The Shienarans.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.209
Incredible
that you can see

27:07.209 --> 27:08.753
the Tower from here, isn't it?

27:13.466 --> 27:15.926
Adeleas and I promised
each other

27:15.926 --> 27:18.262
we wouldn't return there
until our...

27:18.262 --> 27:21.265
"History of the World Since
the Breaking" was complete.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.517
- And yet here you are.
- Yeah.

27:23.517 --> 27:26.020
History needn't be written
when it's being wrought.

27:27.730 --> 27:30.775
Three Fades hunting
a single Aes Sedai?

27:30.775 --> 27:33.027
The eye of the Dark One
is upon you, Sister.

27:33.027 --> 27:35.363
Did you not think
we would ask why?

27:38.115 --> 27:40.242
I assume it's one of the boys
you brought back

27:40.242 --> 27:41.911
to Tar Valon last autumn?

27:43.871 --> 27:45.956
The Dragon?

27:55.049 --> 27:57.093
Who else knows?

27:59.887 --> 28:01.806
Adeleas?

28:01.806 --> 28:03.432
Tomas?

28:03.432 --> 28:05.643
That's close enough.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.734
Good.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.987
I wanted to know how far
you'd go for the Dragon

28:16.987 --> 28:18.906
if you're to lead him
to victory.

28:22.910 --> 28:27.164
Our Sisters wish to cage
the Dragon, to clip his wings.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.584
Their fear that he will break
the world again blinds them

28:30.584 --> 28:32.461
to the truth:

28:32.461 --> 28:37.383
that after all these years,
our world is still broken,

28:37.383 --> 28:41.178
and that what we need is
to make it whole once more.

28:41.178 --> 28:45.433
Well, what's broken
cannot always be healed.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.688
I need an oath
of allegiance, Sister.

28:50.688 --> 28:53.315
An oath declaring what?

28:53.315 --> 28:56.402
That I will never betray you?

28:56.402 --> 28:58.404
That I will never betray him?

28:58.404 --> 29:02.324
Neither of us knows
what the future may bring.

29:02.324 --> 29:06.704
Either of those things
may one day be necessary.

29:06.704 --> 29:11.709
And even oaths have loopholes
one can exploit.

29:11.709 --> 29:17.047
Hmm. For now, you will
simply have to trust me,

29:17.047 --> 29:19.467
and I, you.

29:19.467 --> 29:22.928
There are books in the Tower
that might prove useful.

29:22.928 --> 29:26.265
Prophecies that speak
of Toman Head,

29:26.265 --> 29:30.019
of battles in the sky,
of a sword of flame

29:30.019 --> 29:32.521
and the branded hand
that wields it.

29:32.521 --> 29:35.065
I will find them.

29:37.193 --> 29:39.361
Come.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.947
Come back to the fire,
sit beside us, hmm?

30:03.761 --> 30:05.471
Yah!

30:34.625 --> 30:36.961
I don't want her
to smell you dirty bastards.

30:36.961 --> 30:38.379
You'll do fine.

31:26.927 --> 31:29.972
No. No. N...

31:54.330 --> 31:56.206
Selene.

31:59.209 --> 32:02.504
Listen, I don't think
tonight is...

32:08.594 --> 32:10.679
I have to be alone.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.357
That's the funny thing
about people.

32:23.734 --> 32:26.570
When things get bad,
we want to be alone.

32:27.780 --> 32:30.115
The truth is,

32:30.115 --> 32:32.242
that's when we need
each other the most.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.914
We can be alone together.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.215
No. No.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.107
And the gardens
lead out to the city,

33:03.107 --> 33:05.776
but we're not allowed outside
the Tower without permission.

33:05.776 --> 33:07.319
I've barely spent a few hours
in Tar Valon itself.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.445
Daughter-Heir.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.698
Farina Sedai.

33:11.740 --> 33:12.783
You didn't really need me

33:12.783 --> 33:14.618
to show you around
the Tower, did you?

33:14.618 --> 33:15.911
Well, no.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.996
Six summers here as a girl
and you'd know it

33:17.996 --> 33:19.873
- like the back
of your hand, too.
- Hmm.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.625
But I didn't want
to miss the chance

33:21.625 --> 33:22.918
to get to know you better.

33:22.918 --> 33:23.919
Take them
to my room immediately.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.588
Ah, Sheriam Sedai, I...

33:26.588 --> 33:28.257
Who let your maids
into the novice quarters

33:28.257 --> 33:29.299
with all of this nonsense?

33:29.299 --> 33:31.093
Oh, I...

33:31.093 --> 33:32.261
You may be destined

33:32.261 --> 33:33.679
for the Lion Throne
of Caemlyn, child,

33:33.679 --> 33:34.805
but here

33:34.805 --> 33:36.098
you are a novice,

33:36.098 --> 33:38.142
just the same as any other.

33:38.142 --> 33:40.144
Give me the woman's name.

33:40.144 --> 33:41.687
Now.

33:42.730 --> 33:44.940
She only did it as
a favor to my mother.

33:45.983 --> 33:47.192
Her name.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.029
If what she did
demands punishment,

33:51.029 --> 33:52.656
then I will take it.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.825
Then you will be
in my office

33:54.825 --> 33:56.869
every morning for
the next three months,

33:56.869 --> 33:59.121
feeling the switch
on your shoulders.

33:59.121 --> 34:01.081
Of course, Sheriam Sedai.

34:01.081 --> 34:03.208
Before breakfast or after?

34:05.627 --> 34:06.670
Before.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.380
As you wish.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.298
And you.

34:09.298 --> 34:11.717
Where's Nynaeve al'Meara
gone off to?

34:12.926 --> 34:15.721
I-I'm sorry, I don't know,
Sheriam Sedai.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.681
Have her
come to my study

34:17.681 --> 34:19.725
straightaway when she's back.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.643
Of course.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.481
I'm sorry you had to see that.

34:25.481 --> 34:27.691
At least they pay
attention to you.

34:27.691 --> 34:29.943
The only time an Aes Sedai
ever talks to me

34:29.943 --> 34:31.737
is to ask where my friend is.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.994
Your room.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.662
Well...

34:40.662 --> 34:42.331
you wanted them to clean it out.

35:22.746 --> 35:24.665
My love.

35:24.665 --> 35:26.667
My darling,

35:26.667 --> 35:28.210
you wake up.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.379
I'm with you now.

35:30.379 --> 35:31.588
I'm here.

35:43.350 --> 35:46.979
Now, you must try and
get some of this down.

35:46.979 --> 35:49.356
It'll take
the edge off the pain.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.364
There, there, there.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.074
Yes. Shh.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.870
That's better, this is better.

36:02.870 --> 36:04.955
Shh.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.500
What are you doing here?

36:08.500 --> 36:10.127
The crimsonthorn, I...

36:10.127 --> 36:12.337
I thought you were
trying to kill him.

36:12.337 --> 36:13.755
I thought he was
a man who could channel.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.465
- I...
- Walk away from this place

36:15.465 --> 36:17.259
before I do something
we both regret.

36:18.760 --> 36:19.970
He's in pain.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.472
You think I don't know that?

36:23.473 --> 36:24.975
I can't heal him.

36:26.435 --> 36:28.020
His hand.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.605
It's spasming.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.361
Means the pain is
in his heart, too.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.947
The crimsonthorn
won't help with that.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.325
He'll still be hurting
when you go.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.744
You need turmeric milk
to help smooth the inflammation.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.537
Get out!

36:45.537 --> 36:47.998
Before I kill you, you get out!

36:49.291 --> 36:51.627
Get out,
you stupid girl!

36:53.545 --> 36:55.380
Get out, get out!

36:58.550 --> 37:00.677
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.012
Oh...

37:03.680 --> 37:05.265
I'm sorry.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.184
I'm so sorry.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.352
I didn't know

37:08.352 --> 37:09.728
it would hurt you.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.481
I didn't mean to
leave you here in pain.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.401
I'm so sorry, my... my boy,

37:16.401 --> 37:18.612
my beautiful boy.

37:18.612 --> 37:20.489
I'm sorry.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.562
Shit.

38:01.571 --> 38:02.864
Come on.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.831
Another cell.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.291
Shit.

38:16.086 --> 38:17.170
What?

38:18.171 --> 38:19.715
So, you're the possum

38:19.715 --> 38:21.258
that's been
scratching at my wall.

38:21.258 --> 38:23.301
So, what did you do
to piss off the blonde?

38:23.301 --> 38:24.720
- Nothing.
- Ah.

38:24.720 --> 38:25.887
Is it a sex thing, then?

38:25.887 --> 38:28.015
Yeah, she looks like
she'd be into domination.

38:28.015 --> 38:29.307
Those cheekbones.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.393
Nah. Luckily, I'm not her type.

38:31.393 --> 38:33.020
I think she
prefers her men dead.

38:33.020 --> 38:35.480
Who are you?

38:35.480 --> 38:37.733
And why do they
have you in here?

38:37.733 --> 38:39.651
You got any more of those?

38:51.913 --> 38:53.623
I'm Min.

38:53.623 --> 38:55.625
Mat Cauthon.

39:03.258 --> 39:04.926
No, no, no, no, no.

39:04.926 --> 39:07.220
Do not underestimate him.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.806
Tomas, oh, he was delicious

39:09.806 --> 39:11.558
back in the day.

39:11.558 --> 39:15.187
But he chose our
dear, sweet Verin.

39:17.230 --> 39:20.150
And that was the end
of his sex life.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.158
How about you two?

39:28.158 --> 39:31.203
You've never told us
the story of how you met.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.585
Come, Sister.
It's late, we should, um...

39:38.585 --> 39:39.795
Mm.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.964
It was in the Borderlands,

39:42.964 --> 39:45.008
wasn't it? Hmm?

39:45.008 --> 39:46.343
You probably saw him

39:46.343 --> 39:49.763
prancing across the desert
on a black steed,

39:49.763 --> 39:52.808
sword out, hair
whipping in the wind...

39:52.808 --> 39:54.017
It was
outside Chachin.

39:58.605 --> 40:01.608
I'd been following him
on the road all day.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.320
He kept throwing
glances back at me.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.447
I thought he was a Darkfriend.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.199
I thought she was a mercenary

40:09.199 --> 40:11.118
sent to kill me by my carneira.

40:11.118 --> 40:12.202
Carneira?

40:12.202 --> 40:13.954
Oh, in-in Malkier,

40:13.954 --> 40:15.664
older women take
young men's virginity

40:15.664 --> 40:18.083
to, um, show them
the ways of love.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.084
Mmm.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.461
This is getting good.

40:21.461 --> 40:22.879
I found him
by a pond,

40:22.879 --> 40:24.422
meditating.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.383
His face was still, but so much

40:26.383 --> 40:28.051
raged beneath the surface.

40:28.051 --> 40:29.511
Meditation's never
come easy for me.

40:29.511 --> 40:30.554
Especially not when
you're planning on

40:30.554 --> 40:31.680
killing an Aes Sedai.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.557
I didn't believe
you were an Aes Sedai.

40:33.557 --> 40:35.892
I'd always heard
that they were old...

40:37.769 --> 40:38.854
...cold and sour.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.481
He'd left his sword

40:41.481 --> 40:42.774
sitting on a rock nearby.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.944
But the moment my hand
touched the scabbard,

40:45.944 --> 40:47.320
he'd crossed the ten yards...

40:48.655 --> 40:50.532
...grabbed me
by the scruff of the neck

40:51.783 --> 40:53.243
and tossed me in the water.

40:55.495 --> 40:58.456
You threw Moiraine
Sedai in a pond?

40:58.456 --> 41:01.293
It's unwise to try separating
a man from his sword.

41:02.711 --> 41:04.254
Ah.

41:04.254 --> 41:06.798
And that's when you knew, huh?

41:08.091 --> 41:11.595
Any old Warder can
protect you from a Trolloc.

41:11.595 --> 41:13.930
But the right one,

41:13.930 --> 41:16.516
he can protect you
from yourself.

41:27.611 --> 41:28.862
So...

41:28.862 --> 41:30.071
Mm-hmm.

41:30.071 --> 41:31.406
Think you can fit?

41:31.406 --> 41:33.200
Yeah, let me just, uh...

41:35.285 --> 41:36.494
A bottle of wine?

41:36.494 --> 41:38.747
They usually let me work
through one a week.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.541
It's been a while since I could
have a drink with someone.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.293
Sorry, are you coming on to me?

41:43.293 --> 41:44.836
Oh, please. Move.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.671
Move, move, move. Come on.

41:56.223 --> 41:57.682
Feels like home.

42:05.482 --> 42:06.858
Mmm.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.736
They really pick a color
and run with it, don't they?

42:11.947 --> 42:15.033
So, are you gonna tell me
why you're in here?

42:17.619 --> 42:19.579
I usually avoid Tar Valon.

42:19.579 --> 42:22.290
The riverboat I was on
changed course in the storm,

42:22.290 --> 42:23.708
so I thought, "Why not?

42:23.708 --> 42:25.335
Plenty of bar work
in a big city."

42:25.335 --> 42:26.711
Just my luck,

42:26.711 --> 42:29.881
a Red who loves
a drink recognized me.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.883
So here I am.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.510
But why did they want you?

42:40.684 --> 42:41.768
I see things.

42:41.768 --> 42:42.978
If I keep drinking this,

42:42.978 --> 42:45.230
I'll see things, too.

42:46.815 --> 42:48.358
What kind of things?

42:49.442 --> 42:50.568
Glimpses of the pattern.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.736
Like the future?

42:51.736 --> 42:53.029
Mm.

42:53.029 --> 42:54.030
Wow.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.449
That is way less interesting

42:56.449 --> 42:57.909
than I expected, to be honest.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.912
I'd hoped for at least a murder,

43:00.912 --> 43:03.081
or a secret affair
with an Aes Sedai.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.709
What, seeing the future
isn't interesting to you?

43:05.709 --> 43:06.918
Hmm.

43:07.961 --> 43:10.797
You really don't want to know
what I see when I look at you?

43:10.797 --> 43:14.009
Unless it's how
I get out of here...

43:15.802 --> 43:18.179
Absolutely not.

43:18.179 --> 43:19.806
No, I would rather

43:19.806 --> 43:24.019
not know the shit
that's headed my way.

43:32.193 --> 43:33.570
Better head back.

43:34.863 --> 43:37.032
They usually check
while we're sleeping.

43:38.158 --> 43:39.534
Yeah, um...

43:39.534 --> 43:42.537
will you visit again?

43:42.537 --> 43:45.248
I'll check my
social calendar, possum,

43:45.248 --> 43:46.458
but...

43:46.458 --> 43:47.917
I think it's pretty open.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.690
Min, are you all right?

44:19.157 --> 44:21.451
I don't want to hurt you.

44:23.161 --> 44:24.746
You can't.

44:37.550 --> 44:38.968
You know...

44:40.136 --> 44:42.639
...there was someone
that I loved once.

44:45.767 --> 44:48.353
When he left, I was shattered.

44:49.938 --> 44:51.314
But I knew
no one else could ever

44:51.314 --> 44:53.316
have that power
over me ever again.

44:57.862 --> 45:01.199
What's left to hurt
if he still has my whole heart?

45:05.662 --> 45:08.373
When I'm with you,
I can pretend you're him,

45:08.373 --> 45:10.166
I can pretend I'm...

45:10.166 --> 45:11.459
whole again.

45:15.422 --> 45:17.757
You can't imagine
what a gift that is.

45:18.883 --> 45:22.595
It's so much more than
I've had in a very long time.

45:29.102 --> 45:31.688
Who do you think of...

45:31.688 --> 45:33.398
when you're with me?

45:39.362 --> 45:41.948
Someone I wish I could forget.

45:47.078 --> 45:50.039
Well, maybe that will just

45:50.039 --> 45:52.375
have to be how
this works for us.

45:55.086 --> 45:56.754
You'll help me remember...

45:58.339 --> 46:00.383
...and I'll help you forget.

46:12.645 --> 46:15.023
I present to you

46:15.023 --> 46:16.649
my secret weapon.

46:16.649 --> 46:18.193
The flavor's much better

46:18.193 --> 46:20.403
when I can brew it
in small amounts.

46:22.739 --> 46:24.574
The air weaves that
increase the pressure

46:24.574 --> 46:25.950
and speed up the fermentation,

46:25.950 --> 46:29.287
they're just much more
manageable that way.

46:29.287 --> 46:31.456
It packs a punch.

46:31.456 --> 46:32.457
Sorry.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.667
You worked this out on your own?

46:34.667 --> 46:36.377
I like to tinker with things.

46:36.377 --> 46:38.546
Plus, when one has no friends

46:38.546 --> 46:41.049
and isn't allowed to have fun,

46:41.049 --> 46:43.343
one must fill the hours somehow.

46:44.552 --> 46:46.262
Speaking of friends,

46:46.262 --> 46:47.972
was Sheriam Sedai

46:47.972 --> 46:50.934
asking you about
Nynaeve al'Meara earlier?

46:50.934 --> 46:52.810
Do you know her?

46:54.646 --> 46:56.314
I take it you do.

46:58.107 --> 46:59.692
<i>It's just...</i>

46:59.692 --> 47:01.819
<i>people say that
she's quite powerful.</i>

47:05.448 --> 47:07.534
Egwene, are you there?

47:07.534 --> 47:09.327
We came here together.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.120
She's my best friend.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.790
Light! How exciting...

47:13.790 --> 47:15.333
Exhausting.

47:18.002 --> 47:20.713
No, uh, no, no, it's...

47:20.713 --> 47:23.132
it's-it's not that.

47:23.132 --> 47:25.134
Egwene?

47:25.134 --> 47:28.054
<i>She's not doing
anything exactly.</i>

47:28.054 --> 47:30.390
But I guess that's the problem.

47:30.390 --> 47:32.308
All I do

47:32.308 --> 47:33.851
is study,

47:33.851 --> 47:36.729
work myself to the bone
following the rules,

47:36.729 --> 47:38.690
while she skips classes,

47:38.690 --> 47:41.192
claiming she doesn't
even want to be here.

47:41.192 --> 47:43.486
The hardest thing is,

47:43.486 --> 47:45.363
she says she came here for me,

47:45.363 --> 47:47.490
to protect me.

47:50.076 --> 47:52.328
Like she's always done.

47:52.328 --> 47:54.831
Whether I want it or not.

47:56.207 --> 47:59.002
But where is she
when I actually need her?

48:02.630 --> 48:04.757
She's off sparring with Warders

48:04.757 --> 48:07.594
or becoming Liandrin's
bloody protégé.

48:09.345 --> 48:10.513
I just feel like...

48:11.848 --> 48:13.683
...the harder I try,

48:13.683 --> 48:15.727
the more I fall behind.

48:17.103 --> 48:18.813
And the less she tries...

48:21.024 --> 48:23.151
...the more she gets ahead.

48:24.193 --> 48:25.278
Egwene.

48:25.278 --> 48:26.821
Hmm?

48:26.821 --> 48:29.198
I know we're only just
getting to know each other,

48:29.198 --> 48:31.492
so I hope you'll
forgive me when I say...

48:32.744 --> 48:34.203
...jealousy...

48:36.039 --> 48:37.832
...it's not
the best look on you.

48:40.501 --> 48:41.628
I'm-I'm not jealous.

48:41.628 --> 48:42.629
Egwene.

48:42.629 --> 48:44.672
I am Daughter-Heir

48:44.672 --> 48:47.467
to the most powerful
nation in the world.

48:48.635 --> 48:51.137
I know what jealousy looks like.

49:02.815 --> 49:06.027
Egwene, I have
nothing to say to you.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.657
Liandrin Sedai.

49:10.657 --> 49:12.575
- If this is about earlier...
- If I could take back

49:12.575 --> 49:13.910
what is about to be
offered to you, I would,

49:13.910 --> 49:15.703
but I've already set
the wheels in motion,

49:15.703 --> 49:17.080
so here we are.

49:17.080 --> 49:18.498
Follow me.

49:26.297 --> 49:27.590
Just tell me
where we're going.

49:40.561 --> 49:42.522
Whom do you bring
with you, Sister?

49:42.522 --> 49:45.566
One who comes as a candidate
for Acceptance, Sister.

49:47.318 --> 49:48.653
Is she ready

49:48.653 --> 49:50.029
to face the Arches?

49:50.029 --> 49:51.447
She is ready

49:51.447 --> 49:53.116
to leave behind what she was,

49:53.116 --> 49:54.450
and alone,

49:54.450 --> 49:55.785
passing through her fears,

49:55.785 --> 49:57.662
gain Acceptance.

49:58.830 --> 50:00.540
Does she know what she fears?

50:00.540 --> 50:02.834
She has never faced them

50:02.834 --> 50:04.711
but now is willing.

50:05.753 --> 50:09.132
Then let her face
what she fears.

50:09.132 --> 50:11.718
The hour waits for no woman.

51:23.623 --> 51:25.875
I should have sensed
the Fades were coming.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.837
I should have...

51:30.880 --> 51:32.924
I'm sorry.

51:34.550 --> 51:36.969
Do you know when I actually
decided you'd be my Warder?

51:38.387 --> 51:40.598
It was after Chachin.

51:41.599 --> 51:43.184
We were on our way
back to the Tower

51:43.184 --> 51:44.560
and we stopped
at this little village.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.270
I can't remember
the name, but...

51:47.438 --> 51:48.815
But there were
three Trolloc heads

51:48.815 --> 51:50.858
staked on spears
outside the town.

51:52.902 --> 51:54.070
A warning.

51:56.572 --> 51:58.491
But it didn't faze you.

51:59.867 --> 52:01.494
You'd faced so many
in the Blight,

52:01.494 --> 52:03.955
and I couldn't imagine
the courage it took

52:03.955 --> 52:05.915
to face the Shadow with...

52:07.124 --> 52:08.584
nothing but a sword.

52:09.627 --> 52:11.754
That's when I knew.

52:11.754 --> 52:14.048
Because I knew that
when the time came,

52:14.048 --> 52:15.883
you'd be able
to survive on your own.

52:18.553 --> 52:20.513
You'll go to the Tower

52:20.513 --> 52:22.890
and I'll continue alone.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.854
I'm not leaving you.

52:27.854 --> 52:29.313
I was wrong, Lan.

52:29.313 --> 52:31.148
I was wrong about everything.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.610
The Last Battle's coming,

52:34.610 --> 52:36.946
and we're already losing it.

52:36.946 --> 52:39.198
The cuendillar that broke
at the Eye of the World,

52:39.198 --> 52:42.326
that was the Seal
keeping Ishamael imprisoned.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.287
Ishamael?

52:44.287 --> 52:45.496
The Forsaken?

52:45.496 --> 52:47.456
We didn't defeat the Dark One,

52:47.456 --> 52:49.542
we set his strongest
lieutenant free.

52:51.502 --> 52:53.462
The Forsaken
are 3,000 years old.

52:53.462 --> 52:54.922
They're the strongest
channelers that ever lived,

52:54.922 --> 52:57.800
and Ishamael may
be waking the others.

52:58.801 --> 53:00.386
What they can do
with the One Power

53:00.386 --> 53:03.681
make the Aes Sedai
look like tavern magicians

53:03.681 --> 53:06.017
conjuring birds
from their sleeves.

53:06.017 --> 53:10.021
I mean, he cut me off
with a flick of his wrist.

53:10.021 --> 53:11.772
But it takes eight Aes Sedai
to cut someone off.

53:11.772 --> 53:13.316
Alone, he couldn't,
no matter how...

53:13.316 --> 53:15.526
You have no conception
of the power they wield.

53:15.526 --> 53:16.611
Well, then tell me.

53:16.611 --> 53:19.989
You and I walk
this path together.

53:19.989 --> 53:21.657
Every step of it.

53:21.657 --> 53:23.784
Every choice, every sacrifice...

53:23.784 --> 53:25.995
We've never walked
this path together.

53:27.038 --> 53:28.164
You've never seen the forest

53:28.164 --> 53:29.248
for the trees because

53:29.248 --> 53:30.541
I have never shown it to you.

53:30.541 --> 53:32.418
I know what you're trying to do.

53:33.753 --> 53:35.046
You can't push me away.

53:36.964 --> 53:38.215
Rand's alive.

53:43.429 --> 53:44.805
No.

53:46.057 --> 53:46.974
You said he was dead.

53:46.974 --> 53:48.392
You assumed.

53:48.392 --> 53:51.103
I did what I had
to do to protect

53:51.103 --> 53:52.813
the Dragon Reborn
because my loyalty

53:52.813 --> 53:53.814
is to him

53:53.814 --> 53:55.608
and him alone.

54:00.696 --> 54:02.782
I took an oath to defend you.

54:04.158 --> 54:05.451
To give my life for yours.

54:05.451 --> 54:06.619
And without the bond,

54:06.619 --> 54:07.954
you're unable to
fulfill that oath.

54:07.954 --> 54:10.706
- I'm still your Warder.
- No, you failed me.

54:10.706 --> 54:13.084
Without Verin and Adeleas,
I would be dead.

54:17.713 --> 54:19.090
I am not letting you
walk away from me again.

54:19.090 --> 54:20.758
I know.

54:25.096 --> 54:27.056
Alanna will see you
to the Tower.

54:27.056 --> 54:29.016
I'll have her take
your bond by force

54:29.016 --> 54:30.226
if I must.

54:31.227 --> 54:33.980
I swore myself to you
because I trusted you.

54:35.773 --> 54:39.193
Because I thought that
we were in this together.

54:39.193 --> 54:40.903
Equals.

54:40.903 --> 54:43.239
That was never true,
was it, Moiraine?

54:43.239 --> 54:45.491
An Aes Sedai cannot lie.

54:46.742 --> 54:48.327
So tell me the truth.

54:52.790 --> 54:54.750
We were never equals.

55:01.424 --> 55:03.718
Light protect you...

55:05.678 --> 55:07.263
al'Lan Mandragoran.

56:09.116 --> 56:11.577
Come on! Pull!

57:13.222 --> 57:14.807
Hold your ground!

57:40.916 --> 57:42.209
Rescue him!

57:44.712 --> 57:46.547
Loial!

58:34.803 --> 58:37.139
Shienarans,
with me, at my side!

59:13.801 --> 59:15.094
Take cover!

59:44.873 --> 59:46.667
Stay back!

59:52.214 --> 59:53.257
Come on.

59:54.800 --> 59:56.510
Don't move.

59:59.138 --> 01:00:00.472
What are
you doing?

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:01.473
Get back here.

01:00:36.759 --> 01:00:38.260
Are they ready?

01:00:46.018 --> 01:00:47.770
They'll have to be, won't they?

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.835
<i>Yann was attacked
in the Foregate</i>

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:14.088
last night, so we needed
to fill the position.

01:01:14.088 --> 01:01:15.506
It won't be much different

01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:17.091
than what
you've been doing already.

01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:18.801
Your charges just
have richer families

01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:21.220
or a special patron, is all.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.596
And you get some fresh air.

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:02.386
Your usual orderly had
a terrible accident last night,

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:05.973
so I'll be taking care of you
for the next few months.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:15.357
I have a feeling you and I
have a lot more in common.
