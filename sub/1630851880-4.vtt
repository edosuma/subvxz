A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:08.208 --> 00:09.916
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL LOVE STORY

00:15.333 --> 00:22.333
FOUR MINUTES IN THE PRESENT
AND SEVEN MINUTES IN THE PAST

00:27.000 --> 00:27.833
I can't go on.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.416
I'm beat.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.875
You go ahead, I'll catch up with you.

00:32.375 --> 00:33.333
Okay, Inés.

00:42.208 --> 00:46.166
No wonder I can't run. We had
a 15-course tasting menu last night.

00:47.166 --> 00:48.625
Anniversary dinner.

00:50.208 --> 00:51.250
Where did you go?

00:51.333 --> 00:53.208
On the day of Manu's concert,

00:53.291 --> 00:56.000
did you see a restaurant
that opened next door?

00:56.083 --> 00:58.666
A Peruvian fusion place.
It was really good.

00:59.166 --> 01:01.791
Pedro remembered it
and took me there as a surprise.

01:05.458 --> 01:08.208
We had a few cocktails and a good time.

01:08.291 --> 01:09.166
Sounds nice.

01:10.708 --> 01:11.666
Yeah.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.083
And you?

01:24.708 --> 01:25.583
How are you?

01:25.666 --> 01:27.416
-How are you doing?
-Good.

01:28.458 --> 01:31.416
Good, I didn't sleep much today, but…
I'm good.

01:34.666 --> 01:35.500
Listen,

01:37.125 --> 01:38.833
you don't need to pretend with me.

01:42.083 --> 01:43.083
Yeah, I know.

01:44.541 --> 01:46.833
You know I'm here for you

01:47.916 --> 01:49.291
whenever you need me.

01:50.625 --> 01:51.458
I'm here.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.458
Can we run a bit more?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.250
I'll be right behind you.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.500
Back to bed, Richi.

02:07.291 --> 02:10.333
No, Mommy, let me play a bit longer.

02:12.250 --> 02:14.125
You think you're funny or what?

02:15.166 --> 02:16.958
Julio said you weren't feeling well.

02:17.041 --> 02:18.708
I don't like that Julio guy.

02:20.166 --> 02:21.625
You're my favorite nurse.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.625
Julio brought you paper for your zoo.

02:23.708 --> 02:26.291
It's not like I asked him for a kidney.

02:27.875 --> 02:30.250
Besides, it's not a zoo. It's paradise.

02:32.750 --> 02:35.708
I'm going to change your IV…
and your medication, okay?

02:39.083 --> 02:41.541
When I get out,
I'm going straight to a place like that.

02:41.625 --> 02:44.416
With huge palm trees,
impressive mountains,

02:45.125 --> 02:46.958
a nice beach,

02:47.541 --> 02:50.500
and an asshole monkey that steals
your food when you aren't looking.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.666
Would you come with me?

02:56.458 --> 02:57.416
I won't be able to.

02:58.375 --> 03:00.625
-I'm stuck here all day.
-Sure.

03:00.708 --> 03:04.208
That's an excuse.
That means you have a boyfriend, right?

03:04.958 --> 03:05.791
No.

03:06.708 --> 03:07.541
No?

03:08.708 --> 03:10.000
Come on, I don't believe you.

03:10.958 --> 03:11.875
It's the truth.

03:13.250 --> 03:16.875
Why not? Being in love is the best thing
that can happen to anyone.

03:18.916 --> 03:20.583
I recently broke up with someone.

03:21.541 --> 03:22.375
That's too bad.

03:23.416 --> 03:24.333
Be careful,

03:24.416 --> 03:27.833
there's a fine line between being alone
and being a loner like me.

03:28.708 --> 03:32.000
Don't get too hard-hearted
or it'll be all drama later.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.625
Don't get all deep on me.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.416
We both know you're not going to die.

03:37.208 --> 03:39.458
Wow, I need to watch my words around you.

03:40.791 --> 03:42.416
You look like someone who

03:43.083 --> 03:44.916
wants everything to be perfect.

03:45.000 --> 03:45.833
Richi, enough.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.750
Hey, I'm being serious.

03:51.958 --> 03:55.041
Life can be hard
if you don't share it with someone else.

04:07.375 --> 04:08.291
-Hello.
-Hi.

04:08.375 --> 04:11.000
You called me.
I'm a relative of Nicolás Torres.

04:11.750 --> 04:12.916
My name's Lina Ruiz.

04:21.708 --> 04:25.666
So, the patient's unconscious
and we're running tests.

04:25.750 --> 04:28.666
Even though he was wearing a helmet,
he fell hard.

04:28.750 --> 04:32.416
We need to see how he evolves
over the next few hours.

04:32.916 --> 04:34.625
He's still in danger.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.208
We'll let you know when you can see him,
but you'll have to wait.

05:18.250 --> 05:19.750
-Nico.
-Hello.

05:21.083 --> 05:21.916
Hi.

05:26.375 --> 05:27.375
How are you?

05:29.500 --> 05:30.416
Not so good.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.583
They told me you were on a motorcycle.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.416
Santi lent it to me.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.750
Just to take a spin.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.125
What were you doing on a motorcycle?

05:53.541 --> 05:54.375
I don't know.

06:04.750 --> 06:05.583
What time is it?

06:06.416 --> 06:07.458
Almost 2:00.

06:10.083 --> 06:10.916
I'm hungry.

06:12.958 --> 06:14.500
They'll probably come by soon.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.291
It looks bad, huh?

06:19.083 --> 06:19.958
Yeah, a little.

06:25.833 --> 06:28.125
I didn't think
they'd let you come home today.

06:29.291 --> 06:30.208
It's over now.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.541
Nico, it was just a nightmare.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.125
Days felt like years in there.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.208
Just… thinking about what…

06:46.500 --> 06:47.375
You scared me.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.375
Please, don't ever do this to me again.

06:59.000 --> 06:59.875
I'm sorry.

06:59.958 --> 07:00.791
I know.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.666
I didn't mean to scare you.

07:18.833 --> 07:21.166
Should I put the beer in the freezer?

07:21.250 --> 07:22.875
-Yeah, there's room.
-Okay.

07:22.958 --> 07:25.125
-Did you get alcohol-free ones for me?
-Yes.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.166
I'm on antibiotics.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.333
Can I sit there?

07:29.416 --> 07:30.666
Sit wherever you want.

07:31.583 --> 07:32.708
Here, dude.

07:33.333 --> 07:36.083
-Hey, Nico, nice place you have here.
-Thanks.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.333
When are you back?

07:37.833 --> 07:40.416
I'm starting to get sick
of the kids' class.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.208
I have one more week of treatment.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.916
After that,
I can teach without getting in the water.

07:45.000 --> 07:45.916
Super fun.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.500
Water aerobics, your favorite!

07:49.541 --> 07:51.958
-You really fell hard, huh?
-What a mess.

07:52.041 --> 07:53.458
It wasn't that big of a deal.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.958
Noe told me fixing the motorcycle
is going to cost her a fortune.

08:00.916 --> 08:01.791
Yeah, that sucks.

08:02.708 --> 08:06.250
-She should buy a new one instead, right?
-She should.

08:08.333 --> 08:09.291
We brought more.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.375
They're in the kitchen.

08:14.708 --> 08:15.541
I'll get them.

08:17.625 --> 08:21.750
-Nico, I haven't told you yet.
-Are you seriously going to tell it again?

08:21.833 --> 08:24.250
Of course I am. So…

08:24.333 --> 08:27.916
Listen. The other day,
I turned off the pool lights,

08:28.958 --> 08:32.500
I went upstairs and realized
an old lady was still swimming.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.291
No way.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.958
She was in her seventies.

08:36.458 --> 08:39.166
I spotted her because of her cap.
It was reflective.

08:39.250 --> 08:42.208
It reflected the emergency lights,
or else…

08:42.291 --> 08:44.541
The lady said she didn't notice.

09:19.791 --> 09:20.666
Who is Noe?

09:23.958 --> 09:25.166
She's my coworker.

09:26.541 --> 09:29.291
She hasn't been there long. She's new.

09:31.083 --> 09:31.958
Right.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.708
The motorcycle was hers.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.625
How's she doing?

09:42.625 --> 09:43.458
Fine.

09:46.875 --> 09:48.916
She had minor burns. She's fine.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.500
-Lina…
-Did you hook up with her?

10:07.541 --> 10:08.708
You slept with her.

10:10.916 --> 10:12.125
It didn't mean anything.

10:14.583 --> 10:18.041
I've been terrified thinking something bad
could've happened to you.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.666
And feeling shitty
for thinking the worst of you.

10:22.625 --> 10:25.583
Thinking, "No, Lina.
It's in your head, you're going crazy."

10:26.583 --> 10:28.291
You saw it and didn't do anything!

10:30.375 --> 10:31.375
It's not fair.

10:32.750 --> 10:35.083
It isn't fair to feel this way
because of your shit.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.083
I'm sorry.

10:37.166 --> 10:40.416
It's like when someone
wants to be with anyone but you.

10:41.791 --> 10:42.958
Like with my dad.

10:43.541 --> 10:46.250
He made me feel like
I didn't deserve his love,

10:46.333 --> 10:47.750
or to ever be loved.

10:48.958 --> 10:51.208
One day I said,
"You'll never feel that way again."

10:53.291 --> 10:54.833
You made me feel that way today.

10:56.791 --> 10:57.791
And now, well…

10:59.416 --> 11:01.000
I don't know what to do about this.

11:04.541 --> 11:05.708
Lina, I love you.

12:44.291 --> 12:47.833

ANY SIMILARITY IS COINCIDENTAL.
