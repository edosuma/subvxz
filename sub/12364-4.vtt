24:21.044 --> 24:22.375
ACTUALLY, NO...

24:23.463 --> 24:24.748
'CAUSE NEITHER
OF THOSE SAMPLES

24:24.964 --> 24:26.545
WAS DAVID RIDGES' DNA.

24:26.758 --> 24:27.838
WHOSE WAS IT?

24:28.718 --> 24:30.003
THEY'RE MINE.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.175
I CONDUCTED A TEST.

24:32.847 --> 24:34.132
I PUT MY OWN HAIR AND BLOOD

24:34.349 --> 24:37.261
ON SOME ANIMAL REMAINS
AND SET IT ON FIRE.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.808
BOOM.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.227
POSITIVE DNA MATCH
TO MYSELF.

24:42.523 --> 24:45.185
SO, YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT
DAVID FAKED HIS OWN SUICIDE

24:45.401 --> 24:46.982
WITH NIGHTHORSE'S HELP,

24:47.195 --> 24:48.685

ON AN ANIMAL CARCASS,

24:48.905 --> 24:49.860
AND CREMATED IT?

24:50.073 --> 24:53.236
AND NOW I HAVE PROOF THAT
YOUR DNA CAN SHOW UP IN ASHES

24:53.451 --> 24:55.237
AND YOU CAN STILL
BE ALIVE.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.623
LET ME REOPEN
THE DAVID RIDGES CASE.

25:02.085 --> 25:05.919
WE'LL REOPEN THE CASE AFTER
I FINISH UP WITH THOSE KIDS

25:06.130 --> 25:08.963
AND AFTER YOU TAKE
SOME ACTUAL DAYS OFF.

O KAY.

25:27.485 --> 25:28.565
HOW WOULD YOU SAY

25:28.778 --> 25:32.316
YOUR BIGHORN HORIZONS
LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE HAS GONE?

25:34.367 --> 25:36.983
THIS IS ABOUT JANE,
ISN'T IT?

25:38.121 --> 25:40.112
I HEARD YOU GUYS
YELLING IN THE WOODS.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.079
SO,
IS JANE ALIVE OR DEAD?

25:42.291 --> 25:43.667
'CAUSE IF SHE'S DEAD,
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

25:44.127 --> 25:45.913
HOW IS IT NOT
YOUR FAULT?

25:46.129 --> 25:47.960
I WAS JUST PLAYING AROUND.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.788
LOOK, ALL I DID
WAS SNEAK UP ON HER TENT

25:51.009 --> 25:52.294
AND WHISPER HER NAME.

25:52.510 --> 25:53.841
THE FREAKING OUT
AND THE RUNNING OFF A CLIFF

25:54.053 --> 25:55.463
WAS HER IDEA.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.841
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA DO.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.797
WHY DIDN'T YOU
GO FOR HELP?

26:00.393 --> 26:03.226
UH, ACTUALLY,
I DID TRY. I YELLED.

26:03.438 --> 26:05.053
BUT ADAM,
THE GREAT LEADER,

26:05.273 --> 26:08.390
HAD SPREAD EVERYBODY SO FAR
APART, NOBODY COULD HEAR ME.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.110
AND HE ABANDONED ME
THE DAY BEFORE,

26:10.319 --> 26:12.571
SO I HAD NO IDEA WHERE I WAS
OR WHERE ANYBODY ELSE WAS.

26:12.780 --> 26:15.567
THEN I REALIZED EVERYONE
WOULD BLAME ME, SO I STOPPED.

26:15.783 --> 26:16.943
AND HID.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.242
INDEED, UNTIL I COULD FIND
SOMEONE WITH A CELLPHONE.

26:19.454 --> 26:20.409
THEN I CALLED MY MOM.

26:20.621 --> 26:21.576
WHERE IS SHE,
BY THE WAY?

26:21.789 --> 26:22.778
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO
PICK ME UP.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.116
SHE WAS TIRED
FROM THE TRIP, SO...

26:27.336 --> 26:30.373
SO,
IS JANE ALIVE OR DEAD?

26:30.590 --> 26:33.457
SHE'S ALIVE...
BUT ADAM'S DEAD.

26:34.302 --> 26:35.712
RIGHT.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.179
ADAM.

26:37.889 --> 26:39.754
HOW'D HE DIE, ANYWAY?

26:39.974 --> 26:41.965
STABBED
WITH HIS OWN LEATHERMAN?

26:42.268 --> 26:44.429
DID A BEAR CLAW HIM OPEN

26:44.645 --> 26:46.306
AND EAT HIS STOMACH
FULL OF POWER BARS?

26:47.190 --> 26:48.930
WAS HE HIT ON THE HEAD
WITH A ROCK?

26:49.567 --> 26:50.932
COME ON, MAN. TELL ME.

26:51.652 --> 26:53.483
WHY DON'T I
JUST SHOW YOU?

26:58.201 --> 26:59.691

YOU COULD HAVE DONE IT.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.080
YEAH, WELL, SURE.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.541
THOSE GUYS ALL THINK
I'M A SOCIOPATH.

27:17.929 --> 27:19.044
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I AM.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.595
BUT NOT ALL SOCIOPATHS
ARE KILLERS.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.550

OR POLITICIANS.

27:24.769 --> 27:27.351
AT LEAST I'M NOT A HYPOCRITE
LIKE ADAM.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.428
HOW WAS ADAM A HYPOCRITE?

27:29.649 --> 27:32.311
HE -- HE WASN'T TRYING
TO TEST OUR LIMITS.

27:32.527 --> 27:34.688
HE WAS TRYING TO BREAK US...
'CAUSE IT MADE HIM FEEL

27:34.904 --> 27:36.644
LIKE HE WAS BETTER THAN US,
BUT HE WASN'T.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.277
AND HE DIDN'T PRACTICE
WHAT HE PREACHED.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.950
HE WOULD LECTURE US
ABOUT ONLY PACKING IN

NEEDED TO SURVIVE.

IN HIS PACK?

27:48.292 --> 27:50.248

27:50.461 --> 27:52.873
JANE SAID SHE CAUGHT YOU GOING
THROUGH HER PACK, AS WELL.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.204
OH, I WENT THROUGH

27:54.423 --> 27:55.378
IT'S A GREAT WAY
TO GET TO KNOW A PERSON.

27:55.591 --> 27:56.797

27:57.009 --> 27:58.670
MR. PERFECT DIDN'T HAVE
A FIRST-AID KIT.

27:58.886 --> 28:01.719
HE HAD PROPHYLACTICS
AND CANNABIS.

28:01.931 --> 28:04.547
SO, WAS HE PLANNING
ON SURVIVING IN THE WILD

28:04.767 --> 28:07.804

28:08.020 --> 28:10.853

28:35.173 --> 28:36.208

28:36.424 --> 28:37.914

28:42.388 --> 28:44.629
AND, TO PUT YOUR MIND
AT EASE...

28:48.311 --> 28:50.267
...I DO HAVE
SOME OTHER LEADS.

28:50.479 --> 28:51.810

29:33.564 --> 29:36.476
SO, WOLVERINE WAS TELLING THE
TRUTH ABOUT MARSHALL JEFFORDS.

29:36.692 --> 29:39.354

FOR STABBING ANOTHER KID,

WHO FOUND THE BODY, SO...

29:42.573 --> 29:44.154

KILLED ADAM

29:44.367 --> 29:46.073

BY CALLING IT IN?

SOLUTION IS THE RIGHT ONE.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.742

30:01.133 --> 30:03.044
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH
ABOUT MARSHALL,

EVERYONE HAD IN THEIR PACKS

30:05.721 --> 30:07.507
IN HIS JOURNALS
WAS TOTALLY ACCURATE.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.761

30:10.977 --> 30:12.467

WAS IN ADAM'S PACK.

30:14.272 --> 30:17.105
