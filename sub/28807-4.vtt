[music playing]

00:25.442 --> 00:26.568
Hey, you all right?

00:26.651 --> 00:28.403
It's like you've been
somewhere else all week.

00:28.653 --> 00:29.821
I'm fine, I just...

00:30.113 --> 00:32.240
It's family stuff.
I don't really want to get into it.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.909
Well, today is about you.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.328
Here.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.206
Happy birthday.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.672
That's the new one.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.260
It's all white, so I figured,
you know, it's gonna go with everything.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.096
Thanks. [chuckles]

00:57.140 --> 00:58.391
I mean, if you don't like it...

00:58.475 --> 00:59.684
No, it's just...

01:00.018 --> 01:01.561
Brady, I always wear this one.

01:01.936 --> 01:03.563
You know it's my grandfather's.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.899
Yeah, but that one doesn't even tell time.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.275
Here, come on, just...

01:08.735 --> 01:09.819
Try this one on.

01:10.070 --> 01:10.987
Here.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.117
Just like that.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.452
Now, come on.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.120
Is that not perfect?

01:19.871 --> 01:21.539
Here. I'll just put this...

01:23.083 --> 01:24.042
in here.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.214
Are you ready?

01:31.424 --> 01:32.592
Let's get this over with.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.637
-[chuckles]
-What's up, man?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.472
Alright, okay. And stop.

01:38.056 --> 01:38.890
Take it off.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.226
[all] Surprise!

01:42.519 --> 01:43.394
What?

01:44.479 --> 01:45.855
Oh, HBD, bitch.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.441
-Almost legal.
-Something to look forward to.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.359
Hey.

01:49.692 --> 01:50.735
Happy birthday, T.

01:50.985 --> 01:53.738
-Like, way to turn up 17 in style.
-Thanks for coming.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.698
-Hey!
-Happy birthday!

01:57.492 --> 01:59.494
Happy birthday to my baby!

01:59.702 --> 02:02.372
-Thank you for everything, Mom.
-We pulled it off, didn't we?

02:03.164 --> 02:06.209
And just wait for the sunset.
It's gonna be perfect.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.169
Oh, there's my birthday girl.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.631
Were you surprised?

02:12.382 --> 02:13.424
Continuously.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.093
[Lori] Wait, Tabby.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.638
I didn't get one of you smiling.
Can we redo your entrance, please?

02:18.721 --> 02:20.807
-Seriously?
-Yes, come on. It'll be quick.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.517
Please. I wanna post a good one.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.395
-I'll just take one with Brady and I.
-Okay.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.398
All right. Ready?

02:29.858 --> 02:31.276
Smile!

02:31.359 --> 02:32.819

With teeth.

02:34.779 --> 02:35.864
[Brady chuckles]

02:39.159 --> 02:41.452
Why does coming here make me want to
steal more than ever?

02:41.536 --> 02:43.163
Work the steps, mama.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.167
So, is anyone good playing
at Paper Tiger tonight?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.084
Private party.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.796
So, where is the third Musketeer?

02:52.714 --> 02:54.340
If you're referring to Tabitha,

02:54.549 --> 02:56.384
she's hosting her own party tonight.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.428
It's her sour 17.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.512
[chuckles]

02:59.888 --> 03:01.055
You're tough, Moe.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.641
Seriously, she doesn't seem so bad.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.144
What's the deal with her boyfriend?

03:06.686 --> 03:09.022
Who cares? What is this, the Tabitha hour?

03:09.355 --> 03:11.983
I don't know.
Is it weird that she didn't invite us?

03:12.066 --> 03:14.068
No, it would be weird if we were.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.154
You couldn't pay me to go to that party.

03:16.237 --> 03:19.282
Actually, paying me would be the only way
you can get me to go.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.034
Yeah, speaking of getting paid...

03:21.242 --> 03:23.203
I gotta head to work. See you around.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.454
Later, man.

03:28.541 --> 03:32.128
Okay, the thought of you Insta-stalking
this party all night is just too sad.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.255
Come on.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.800
You're taking me to your house
for a good old-fashioned hang.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.969
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.805
I need food.
And tea that doesn't taste like pee.

03:43.514 --> 03:44.974
[music playing in background]

03:48.019 --> 03:49.812
-A toast to the birthday girl.
-[Lori] Yay!

03:49.896 --> 03:52.190
Just one, since it's a special occasion.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.859
Oh, yeah. See? That's the good stuff.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.319
I like how you roll.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.404
-Nothing but the best.
-Hm.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.406
Brady, do the honors.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.324
Absolutely.

04:01.824 --> 04:02.784
To Tabitha.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.203
To all the women in our lives...

04:06.704 --> 04:08.081
who make us better men.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.750
[scoffs] You don't make it easy,
but I love you.

04:10.833 --> 04:11.834
[laughs]

04:18.383 --> 04:19.259
Happy birthday.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.010
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.183
[Brady] Ooh. It's pretty good.

04:27.850 --> 04:28.851
It's pretty good.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.396
Hey, pace yourself.

04:31.854 --> 04:32.939
Oh, no, it's okay.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.983
-I got her.
-Tabby...

04:35.608 --> 04:36.693
hold on to this one.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.027
[chuckles]

04:38.403 --> 04:41.155
Yeah. Maybe one day,
we can be just like you and Mom.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.412
Hey.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.455
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.291
I just need some fresh air.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.629
[chuckles]

05:08.433 --> 05:10.351
[Elodie] And this I got from Forever 21.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.354
And this is from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.606
So, you've been busy.

05:16.899 --> 05:20.278
Yeah, I got a little carried away
with my last haul.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.946
You can have this if you want.

05:22.613 --> 05:23.614
Thanks.

05:24.615 --> 05:27.160
So, at the meetings, when you said
you've only lifted a few times,

05:27.243 --> 05:29.871
I'm guessing
that was a bit of an understatement.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.539
Don't you lie in there?

05:33.499 --> 05:34.459
Good point.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.590
Sometimes, I just like
looking at all of it together.

05:41.883 --> 05:42.759
Do you ever do that?

05:43.134 --> 05:44.010
[Moe] Dude.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.595
You're kind of intense.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.598
What did you, like,
pack this up when you moved?

05:49.724 --> 05:52.143
I find it oddly calming.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.313
People, places, they come and go, but...

05:56.356 --> 05:58.399
objects stay, you know?

06:01.694 --> 06:03.363
Why? What do you do with your stash?

06:04.614 --> 06:05.573
I'm...

06:06.699 --> 06:07.909
less of a hoarder.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.746
I usually just, like, use whatever I take.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.664
Oh, my God.

06:15.291 --> 06:19.879
The look on Tabitha's face when you
flashed this was literally life-affirming.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.174
What's the deal with you two?

06:24.008 --> 06:25.593
You used to be friends?

06:26.886 --> 06:29.055
Yeah, in, like, grade school.

06:29.722 --> 06:30.556
What happened?

06:32.892 --> 06:33.851
[Moe] I don't know, man.

06:34.310 --> 06:38.272
She changed, I changed.
It was a really long time ago.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.276
So...

06:42.985 --> 06:45.279
you guys didn't have a fight
or anything? Just...

06:45.988 --> 06:47.073
stopped being friends?

06:48.199 --> 06:49.409
Yeah, something like that.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.412
So, um...

06:52.995 --> 06:55.540
-how is the snack game around here?
-Oh.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.212
Rad.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.588
[both laugh]

07:03.756 --> 07:05.007
[sighs]

07:05.591 --> 07:07.593
This fridge is sending me
a lot of mixed messages.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.762
Okay, I see you, dinosaur kale.

07:09.846 --> 07:13.182
Kombucha in four flavors
feels like overkill.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.769
Generic string cheese
and generic soy milk.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.230
Honestly shocked, but processing.

07:19.313 --> 07:22.525
Oh, but you've got the homemade
almond milk, so... kinda saves it a bit.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.070
Where does your dad keep his snacks?

07:26.362 --> 07:27.196
Huh?

07:27.530 --> 07:29.907
In the garage?
I bet he secret-eats Cheetos.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.784
I hide them under the sink.

07:33.369 --> 07:34.203
Oh.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.788
-Hi...
-Hey.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.623
-...sir.
-Call me Doug.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.461
Sorry, I didn't mean to
sneak up on you ladies.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.837
-Dad!
-What?

07:42.920 --> 07:44.589
Your... pants.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.633
Oh, I just went for a ride to Tryon Creek.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.760
Oh, next time,
you should go to Kelly Point Park.

07:49.844 --> 07:53.514
It's a tougher ride, but the hidden beach
is so dope. It's definitely worth it.

07:53.598 --> 07:57.435
I've been trying to get this one to go
with me to Kelley Point for weeks now.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.021
I'm not going anywhere
with you dressed like that.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.148
[Moe] Sometimes you gotta go all in.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.484
She gets me.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.568
Hm?

08:07.111 --> 08:12.033
Uh... El, maybe your girlfriend
would like to stay for dinner?

08:12.700 --> 08:16.704
I mean, your friend, you know,
that's a girl.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.918
Or maybe you're more than friends.
Either way, I'm cool.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.837
We're not staying for dinner.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.802
Yo, can I get a sink Cheeto?

08:35.598 --> 08:36.516
[whispers] Thanks.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.061
But of course, the other problem
with going to Japan

08:40.144 --> 08:42.688
is that it really ruins sushi
when you come back.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.275
-Um, Auntie Cathy, I'm, I'm just gonna--
-Oh, go. I need a refill.

08:46.817 --> 08:48.069

[Elodie] I know, right?
He's so embarrassing.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.866
No, I mean you.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.702
Doug seems pretty chill.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.621
What?

09:41.080 --> 09:46.168
I just find it weird that you,
of all people, think my lame dad is chill.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.088
What can I say? I'm a paradox.

09:50.631 --> 09:54.594
Besides, old people kind of annoy me
less than high school people.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.513
I don't think there's anyone
more annoying than my dad.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.266
I take it you guys aren't close.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.145
My parents divorced when I was six.

10:04.770 --> 10:09.108
And my dad was kind of floundering
back in Albuquerque.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.278
Then he got a job offer here, so...

10:12.778 --> 10:15.114
The old career escape hatch.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.410
It's like the harder he tries,
the more he bothers me.

10:19.827 --> 10:24.373
And seeing him being Mr. Perfect Dad
to my step-brother is maddening.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.374
It's like...

10:25.958 --> 10:28.336
where were you the last ten years?

10:30.463 --> 10:33.924
Well, he definitely spent
a solid amount of time buying spandex.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.134
Ew.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.011
Don't remind me.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.348
Yeah.

10:42.016 --> 10:42.933
My dad...

10:43.351 --> 10:45.061
hasn't exactly been around.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.021
So...

10:47.271 --> 10:49.023
shout out to deadbeat dads.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.527
Do you see him?

10:54.779 --> 10:55.696
No.

10:57.073 --> 10:57.948
That sucks.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.575
It is what it is.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.244
My mom's a fucking hero, though.

11:03.037 --> 11:06.123
Yeah, and now that
my brother's away, it's...

11:06.207 --> 11:07.500
just the two of us.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.648
You doing all right over here?

11:32.983 --> 11:33.859
Yeah.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.236
I'm fine.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.535
Well, you know that watch
looks great on you, right?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.832

to miss any of my texts.

-What's that supposed to mean?
-You know it's my birthday.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.381
You can lighten up for one night.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.049
Why is it always something with you?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.926
I mean, we're throwing you
this huge-ass party

11:59.009 --> 12:00.678
and you're acting like a spoiled brat.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.764
This is my favorite version of you.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.850
I don't want to fight tonight.
Let's just...

Can you stop?

-Listen, I mean it, Brady.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.648
-Come on.
-Jesus!

-Look, don't ever touch me again.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.346
Hey, Jackson.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.390
Sup, Moe? It's been a minute.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.559
If you miss me,
why don't you just come out and say it?

12:48.809 --> 12:50.227
Let's catch up later?

12:50.519 --> 12:51.395
We'll see.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.439
What's his deal?

12:54.690 --> 12:56.776
He was friends with my older brother, Ben.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.528
-Were you guys ever...
-He got me through a slow patch.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.207
Oh, there she is.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.209
Hey, Tabby.

Hey.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.296
Have you tried the soft-shell crab yet?

13:17.379 --> 13:19.632
-It's heaven.
-Yeah, Mom, you...

13:20.174 --> 13:22.259
-really outdid yourself.
-Oh, you know.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.762
You were right about the raw bar.
Everybody is loving it.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.558
Hey.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.976
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

13:31.936 --> 13:32.812
I'm fine.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.480
What's wrong?

13:36.982 --> 13:38.192
Brady and I broke up.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.362
But you guys were fine just a minute ago.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.489
Mom, we haven't been fine for a while.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.158
Everything is so dramatic with you two.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.328
But it's okay.
Your father and I were the same.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.581
Mm-hm. Something I aspire to be.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.708
Look, you guys will work it out.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.252
-You always do Tabitha.
-I don't know.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.838
Maybe there's a reason
that we keep on breaking up.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.174
Maybe we're not supposed to be together.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.260
Tabby, don't be so moody.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.095
-You guys are a perfect for each other.
-No, we're not.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.055

14:10.432 --> 14:11.308

14:19.316 --> 14:20.776
So can you pull it together?

14:21.652 --> 14:22.486
Please?

14:22.987 --> 14:25.364
I promise you,
tomorrow you guys will be fine.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.827
