00:58.080 --> 00:59.752
Yare, yare!

01:00.760 --> 01:03.513
Take in the topsail

01:03.680 --> 01:05.352
Tend to the master's whistle!

01:11.000 --> 01:14.436
Bestir, bestir!

01:14.600 --> 01:16.875
Good Boatswain, have care

01:17.040 --> 01:19.838
Where's the master?
Play the men

01:20.000 --> 01:22.195
l pray now, keep below

01:22.360 --> 01:24.271
Where is the master, bos'n?

01:24.440 --> 01:25.793
Do you not hear him!?

01:25.960 --> 01:29.157
You mar our labour,
keep your cabins

01:29.320 --> 01:30.799
you do assist the storm

01:30.960 --> 01:33.952
Nay, good, be patient

01:34.120 --> 01:35.519
When the sea is

01:38.240 --> 01:41.471
Good, yet remember
whom thou hast aboard

01:41.840 --> 01:44.991
None that l more love than myself

01:45.160 --> 01:47.071
Silence, trouble us not!

01:47.240 --> 01:49.037
Out of our way, l say!

02:21.160 --> 02:23.276
Yet again? What do you here?

02:23.440 --> 02:25.749
Shall we give o'er, and drown?
Have you a mind to sink?

02:25.920 --> 02:31.040
A pox o' your throat, you bawling,
blasphemous, incharitable dog!

02:31.200 --> 02:32.997
Work you, then

02:33.160 --> 02:37.915
Hang, cur, hang! You whoreson,
insolent noisemaker

02:38.080 --> 02:40.799
we are less afraid
to be drowned than thou art

02:40.960 --> 02:45.556
Off to sea again!
Lay her off!

03:07.360 --> 03:09.999
Hell is empty and all the devils here!

03:28.800 --> 03:33.476
lf by your art, my dearest mother, you
have put the wild waters in this roar

03:33.640 --> 03:34.550
allay them...

03:35.040 --> 03:38.316
O, l have suffered with those that
l saw suffer

03:38.480 --> 03:41.756
A brave vessel, who had, no doubt,
some noble creature in her

03:42.320 --> 03:44.276
dash'd all to pieces

03:45.240 --> 03:48.471
Poor souls, they perish'd!

03:56.920 --> 04:00.708
Be collected
No more amazement

04:01.240 --> 04:04.550
tell thy piteous heart there's no
harm done

04:04.720 --> 04:07.792
- O, woe the day!
- No harm

04:09.680 --> 04:13.275
l have done nothing but in care of thee,
of thee, my dear one, thee

04:13.440 --> 04:17.353
my daughter, who art ignorant
of what thou art

04:17.680 --> 04:19.716
nought knowing of whence l am

04:19.880 --> 04:23.031
nor that l am more better than Prospera

04:23.200 --> 04:27.876
master of a full poor cell
and thy no greater mother

04:28.280 --> 04:30.840
More to know did never meddle
with my thoughts

04:31.600 --> 04:34.717
'Tis time l should inform thee farther

04:45.120 --> 04:49.079
So. Lie there, my art

04:55.280 --> 04:58.875
Wipe thou thine eyes, have comfort

04:59.480 --> 05:01.152
The direful spectacle of the wreck

05:01.360 --> 05:03.828
which touch'd the very virtue
of compassion in thee

05:04.000 --> 05:08.357
l have with such provision in mine art so
safely ordered that there is no soul

05:08.520 --> 05:11.114
No, not so much perdition as an hair

05:11.560 --> 05:13.357
betid to any creature in the vessel

05:13.760 --> 05:17.196
which thou heard'st cry,
which thou saw'st sink

05:17.360 --> 05:20.397
Sit down, and be attentive

05:22.480 --> 05:26.951
Canst thou remember a time
before we came unto this cell?

05:27.120 --> 05:29.998
l do not think thou canst, for then thou
wast not out three years old

05:30.160 --> 05:31.593
Certainly, ma'am, l can

05:33.040 --> 05:37.192
By what? By any other
house or person?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.389
Of any thing the image tell me that hath
kept with thy remembrance

05:41.560 --> 05:44.950
'Tis far off, and rather like a dream

05:45.120 --> 05:48.715
Had l not Four or five women
once that tended me?

05:51.040 --> 05:55.477
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda

05:57.640 --> 06:03.431
Twelve year since, Miranda,
twelve year since

06:03.960 --> 06:07.919
thy mother held the Dukedom
of Milan and its princely power

06:08.080 --> 06:10.150
But are not you my mother?

06:10.320 --> 06:18.512
The very same, who long ago was wife
to him who ruled Milan most liberally

06:18.680 --> 06:21.672
who, with as tolerant a hand toward me

06:21.840 --> 06:25.913
gave license to my long hours
in pursuit of hidden truths

06:26.080 --> 06:32.997
of coiled powers contained within
some elements to harm, or heal

06:33.240 --> 06:35.708
l brooked no interruption
but your squalling

06:36.960 --> 06:39.997
for thou, child, art a princess born

06:40.160 --> 06:42.116
O, Heavens!

06:42.280 --> 06:45.317
What foul play had we, that we
came from thence?

06:48.560 --> 06:53.475
Upon thy father's death, authority was
conferred as was his will to me alone

06:53.640 --> 07:00.716
thereby awaking the ambitions of my
brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio

07:00.880 --> 07:03.155
- Thou attendst not...
- Good Madam, l do!

07:03.320 --> 07:09.919
l pray thee, mark me
that a brother should be so perfidious!

07:10.800 --> 07:13.678
He whom l did charge to execute
express commands

07:13.920 --> 07:15.911
as to the prudent
governing of fair Milan

07:16.080 --> 07:19.709
instead undid, subverted
Dost thou attend me?

07:20.320 --> 07:21.833
Ma'am, most heedfully!

07:22.000 --> 07:24.798
Perverting my upstanding studies

07:24.960 --> 07:29.795
now his slandering and bile-dipped
brush did paint a faithless portrait

07:29.960 --> 07:32.872
His sister, a practicer of the black arts!

07:33.040 --> 07:35.076
A demon, not a woman, nay a witch!

07:35.240 --> 07:38.755
And he full-knowing others of
my sex have burned for no less!

07:38.920 --> 07:42.754
The flames now fanned, my counselors
turned against me. Dost thou hear?

07:42.920 --> 07:44.638
Your tale, ma'am, would cure deafness

07:47.320 --> 07:52.030
To credit his own lie he did
believe he was indeed the Duke

07:52.200 --> 07:55.556
confederates wi' the King of
Naples to give him annual tribute

07:55.720 --> 07:59.918
and bend my Dukedom yet unbow'd
to most ignoble stooping

08:00.080 --> 08:01.229
O the heavens!

08:01.680 --> 08:05.673
Now the condition

08:06.240 --> 08:08.674
The King of Naples, being an enemy
to me inveterate

08:08.840 --> 08:10.478
hearkens my brother's suit

08:10.640 --> 08:14.474
which was, that he, should presently
eradicate me and mine

08:14.680 --> 08:16.636
out of the dukedom

08:16.880 --> 08:21.237
and confer fair Milan with
all its honours upon my brother

08:22.640 --> 08:26.997
whereon, one midnight

08:27.160 --> 08:30.118
did Antonio open the gates of Milan

08:30.280 --> 08:34.876
and, i' the dead of darkness his
ministers for the purpose hurried thence

08:35.120 --> 08:39.272
me and thy crying self

08:40.039 --> 08:41.871
Wherefore did they not
that hour destroy us?

08:44.320 --> 08:46.754
Dear, they durst not

08:47.520 --> 08:50.478
so dear the love my people bore me

08:50.640 --> 08:53.518
ln few, they hurried us aboard a bark
bore us some leagues to sea

08:53.680 --> 08:57.036
where they prepared a rotten
carcass of a boat

08:57.200 --> 09:01.716
not rigg'd, nor tackle, sail, nor mast

09:02.160 --> 09:04.435
the very rats instinctively had quit it

09:05.000 --> 09:10.233
there they hoist us to cry
to the sea that roar'd to us

09:10.400 --> 09:15.793
to sigh to the winds whose pity sighing
back again, did us but loving wrong

09:15.960 --> 09:19.236
Alack, what trouble was l then to you!

09:19.400 --> 09:24.315
O, a cherubim thou wast
that did preserve me!

09:24.480 --> 09:28.268
Thou didst smile
lnfused with a fortitude from heaven

09:28.440 --> 09:30.795
that raised in me
an undergoing stomach

09:31.000 --> 09:33.719
to bear up against what should ensue

09:33.880 --> 09:36.553
- How came we ashore?
- By providence divine

09:37.760 --> 09:39.876
Some food we had
and some fresh water

09:40.040 --> 09:43.510
that a noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo

09:43.680 --> 09:47.798
out of his charity, did give us, with rich
garments, stuffs and necessaries

09:47.960 --> 09:50.918
which since have steaded much

09:51.080 --> 09:54.868
Of his gentleness,
knowing l loved my books

09:55.040 --> 09:57.679
he furnish'd me from mine own
library with volumes

09:57.880 --> 09:59.677
that l prize above my dukedom

09:59.840 --> 10:02.957
Would l might but ever see that man!

10:05.920 --> 10:06.636
l pray you, ma'am

10:07.040 --> 10:10.112
for still 'tis beating in my mind, your
reason for raising this sea-storm?

10:10.400 --> 10:12.834
By accident most strange

10:13.000 --> 10:18.518
bountiful fortune now my dear lady, hath
mine enemies brought to this shore

10:18.680 --> 10:20.238
Here cease more questions

10:20.960 --> 10:26.592
Thou art inclined to sleep
'Tis a good dulness, and give it way

10:27.000 --> 10:28.718
l know thou canst not choose

10:36.000 --> 10:39.151
Come away, servant, come

10:39.320 --> 10:44.758
l am ready now
Approach, my Ariel, come

10:48.920 --> 10:54.074
All hail, great master!
Grave dame, hail!

10:54.240 --> 10:57.277
l come to answer thy best pleasure

10:57.440 --> 11:02.389
be't to fly, to swim, to dive into the fire

11:02.560 --> 11:04.835
to ride on the curl'd clouds

11:05.000 --> 11:11.109
to thy strong bidding task Ariel
and all his quality

11:11.280 --> 11:15.114
Hast thou, spirit, perform'd, to point,
the tempest that l bade thee?

11:15.480 --> 11:18.870
To every article
l boarded the King's ship

11:19.360 --> 11:22.113
Now on the beak, now in the
waist, the deck, in every cabin

11:22.280 --> 11:27.479
l flamed amazement; sometime l'd
divide and burn in many places

11:27.640 --> 11:31.030
the fire and cracks of sulphurous roaring
the most mighty Neptune

11:31.240 --> 11:35.597
seem to besiege
and make his bold waves tremble

11:35.760 --> 11:38.558
yea, his dread trident shake

11:38.720 --> 11:40.358
Hi ho!

11:40.520 --> 11:43.478
My brave spirit!

11:43.640 --> 11:47.428
Who was so firm, so constant, that
this coil would not infect his reason?

11:47.600 --> 11:52.469
Not a soul but felt a fever of the mad
and play'd some tricks of desperation

11:52.640 --> 11:56.838
The king's son Ferdinand, with hair
up-staring was the first man that leap'd

11:57.000 --> 12:01.835
cried; Hell is empty
and all the devils here!

12:02.000 --> 12:06.312
Why that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?

12:06.480 --> 12:09.756
- Close by, my master
- But are they, Ariel, safe?

12:09.920 --> 12:13.754
Not a hair perish'd

12:13.920 --> 12:17.469
On their sustaining garments
not a blemish

12:17.640 --> 12:20.279
but fresher than before

12:20.720 --> 12:25.236
and, as thou badest me, in troops l have
dispersed them 'bout the isle

12:25.400 --> 12:28.437
The King's son have l landed by himself

12:28.600 --> 12:31.478
whom l left cooling of the air
with sighs

12:31.640 --> 12:37.192
in an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
his arms in this sad knot

12:37.360 --> 12:40.875
Of the King's ship, the mariners,
say how thou hast disposed

12:41.040 --> 12:45.875
Safely in harbour is the King's ship
in the deep nook, there she's hid

12:46.040 --> 12:50.192
the mariners all under hatches stow'd,
who, with a charm, l have left asleep

12:50.360 --> 12:53.796
Ariel, thy charge exactly is perform'd

12:53.960 --> 12:55.598
but there's more work
What is the time o' the day?

12:56.120 --> 12:58.634
- Past the mid season
- At least two glasses

12:58.800 --> 13:02.759
The time 'twixt six and now must by
us both be spent most preciously

13:03.920 --> 13:05.194
ls there more toil?

13:05.840 --> 13:09.355
Since thou dost give me pains let me
remember thee what thou hast promised

13:09.520 --> 13:11.112
which is not yet perform'd me

13:11.320 --> 13:17.236
How now? Moody?
What is't thou canst demand?

13:18.080 --> 13:19.672
My liberty

13:19.840 --> 13:22.195
Before the time be out? No more!

13:22.360 --> 13:25.238
l prithee, remember
l have done thee worthy service

13:25.440 --> 13:27.908
thou didst promise to bate me a full year

13:29.400 --> 13:32.198
Dost thou forget from what
a torment l did free thee?

13:32.720 --> 13:34.358
- No
- Thou dost

13:35.120 --> 13:39.272
- l do not, ma'am
- Thou liest, malignant thing!

13:41.960 --> 13:45.157
Hast thou forgot the foul witch Sycorax

13:45.600 --> 13:47.875
hast thou forgot her?

13:48.040 --> 13:50.110
- No, ma'am
- Thou hast

13:50.280 --> 13:51.918
Where was she born? Speak! Tell me

13:52.080 --> 13:53.513
Ma'am, in Algiers

13:54.160 --> 13:55.593
O, was she so?

13:55.840 --> 13:59.230
l must once in a month recount what
thou hast been, which thou forget'st

13:59.400 --> 14:00.833
This damn'd witch Sycorax

14:01.040 --> 14:04.476
for mischiefs manifold and sorceries
terrible to enter human hearing

14:04.640 --> 14:07.393
from Algiers, thou know'st,
was banish'd ls not this true?

14:07.560 --> 14:08.390
Ay, ma'am

14:08.560 --> 14:11.028
This blue-eyed hag was
hither brought with child

14:11.280 --> 14:13.555
and here was left by the sailors

14:13.720 --> 14:17.269
Thou, my slave, as thou report'st
thyself, wast then her servant

14:17.440 --> 14:22.036
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate to
act her earthy and abhorr'd commands

14:22.200 --> 14:25.317
she did confine thee into a cloven pine

14:25.480 --> 14:30.110
within which rift imprison'd thou didst
painfully remain a dozen years

14:30.280 --> 14:33.158
within which space she died
and left thee there

14:33.320 --> 14:36.596
thou best knows what a torment
l did found thee

14:36.760 --> 14:39.479
thy groans did make wolves howl

14:39.640 --> 14:43.428
and penetrate the breasts
of ever angry bears

14:48.000 --> 14:50.833
lt was mine art,
when l arrived and heard thee

14:51.080 --> 14:53.514
that made gape the pine,
and let thee out

14:55.280 --> 14:57.032
l thank thee, master

14:57.200 --> 15:00.749
lf thou more murmur'st l will rend an oak

15:00.920 --> 15:06.358
and peg thee in his knotty entrails till
thou hast howl'd away twelve winters

15:13.880 --> 15:16.758
Pardon, master

15:19.680 --> 15:22.911
l will be correspondent to the command

15:23.080 --> 15:27.039
- and do my spiriting gently
- Do so

15:28.600 --> 15:32.229
and after two days l will discharge thee

15:32.400 --> 15:35.995
That's my noble master!

15:37.040 --> 15:41.318
What shall l do? Say what?
What shall l do?

15:41.480 --> 15:45.029
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea

15:45.200 --> 15:49.159
Be subject to no sight but thine or mine,
invisible to every eyeball else

15:49.480 --> 15:51.436
Go! Hence with diligence!

15:59.080 --> 16:02.117
Awake, dear heart, awake!

16:02.280 --> 16:05.989
Thou hast slept well. Awake!

16:07.760 --> 16:11.514
The strangeness of your story put
heaviness in me

16:11.680 --> 16:13.989
Shake it off. Come on

16:14.160 --> 16:16.879
We'll visit with Caliban, my slave

16:17.040 --> 16:20.874
who never yields us kind answer

16:22.280 --> 16:24.919
'Tis a villain, ma'am,
l do not love to look on

16:25.200 --> 16:27.555
But, as 'tis, we cannot miss him

16:27.720 --> 16:30.951
He does make our fire,
fetches in our wood

16:31.120 --> 16:34.078
and serves in offices that profit us

16:46.320 --> 16:49.312
What, ho! Slave!

16:49.720 --> 16:55.113
Caliban! Thou earth, thou! Speak

16:55.280 --> 16:59.671
- There's wood enough within!
- Come forth, l say!

17:02.760 --> 17:05.752
l must eat my dinner

17:08.920 --> 17:12.195
There's other business for thee.
Come, thou tortoise! When?

17:13.640 --> 17:17.791
Thou poisonous slave, got by the
devil himself upon thy wicked dam

17:17.960 --> 17:20.190
Come forth!

17:35.080 --> 17:38.550
As wicked dew as e'er my mother

17:38.720 --> 17:44.033
brush'd with raven's feather from
unwholesome fen drop on you both!

17:45.200 --> 17:49.876
A south-west blow on ye
and blister you all o'er!

17:50.640 --> 17:54.918
For this, be sure, to-night thou
shalt have cramps

17:55.080 --> 17:57.674
side-stitches that shall pen
thy breath up

17:57.840 --> 18:00.308
Urchins shall work all exercise on thee

18:00.480 --> 18:02.835
thou shalt be pinch'd as thick as
honeycomb

18:03.000 --> 18:06.788
each pinch more stinging
than bees that made 'em

18:07.000 --> 18:11.915
This island is mine by Sycorax my
mother, which thou tak'st from me

18:13.840 --> 18:18.755
When thou camest first, thou strok'st
me and madest much of me

18:19.320 --> 18:21.675
wouldst give me water with berries in't

18:21.920 --> 18:24.434
and teach me how to
name the bigger light

18:24.600 --> 18:27.956
and how the less,
that burn by day and night

18:29.080 --> 18:35.519
And then l loved thee and show'd
thee all the qualities o' th' isle

18:35.680 --> 18:41.710
the fresh springs, brine-pits
barren place and fertile

18:42.200 --> 18:44.953
Cursed be l that did so!

18:45.280 --> 18:51.310
All the charms of Sycorax toads,
beetles, bats, light on you!

18:51.560 --> 18:57.590
For l am all the subjects that you have,
which first was mine own king

18:58.560 --> 19:01.279
and here you sty me in this hard rock

19:01.440 --> 19:04.591
whiles you do keep from me
the rest o' th' island

19:04.760 --> 19:08.469
Thou most lying slave, whom
stripes may move, not kindness!

19:08.640 --> 19:13.156
l have used thee, with humane care,
lodged thee in mine own cell

19:13.320 --> 19:16.551
till thou didst seek to violate
the honour of my child

19:21.000 --> 19:22.433
Would't had been done!

19:22.600 --> 19:26.752
Thou didst prevent me: l had peopled
else this isle with Calibans

19:26.920 --> 19:28.512
Abhorred slave

19:29.040 --> 19:31.349
which any print of goodness
wilt not take

19:31.960 --> 19:33.837
l pitied thee

19:34.000 --> 19:35.718
took pains to make thee speak

19:35.880 --> 19:41.159
You taught me language, and my
profit on't is, l know how to curse

19:41.320 --> 19:43.709
The red plague rid you for
learning me your language!

19:43.880 --> 19:46.792
Hagseed, hence!

19:47.120 --> 19:49.714
Fetch us in fuel. Shrug'st thou, malice?

19:49.880 --> 19:54.192
lf thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly what
l command, l'll rack thee with old cramps

19:54.360 --> 19:59.639
fill all thy bones with aches, make thee
roar that beasts shall tremble at thy din

19:59.800 --> 20:02.678
No, pray thee

20:04.880 --> 20:08.429
l must obey. Her art is of such power

20:08.600 --> 20:10.431
So, slave: hence!

20:45.480 --> 20:54.752
Come unto these darkened sands

20:54.920 --> 21:01.837
and then take hands

21:03.480 --> 21:11.433
Curtsied when you have and kiss'd

21:11.600 --> 21:18.199
the wild waves whist

21:18.360 --> 21:22.876
foot it featly here and there

21:23.040 --> 21:27.670
and, sweet sprites, the burden bear

21:27.840 --> 21:32.391
Hark, hark! The watchdogs bark!

21:32.560 --> 21:37.395
Hark, hark! The watchdogs bark!

21:37.560 --> 21:39.915
Where should this music be?

21:40.080 --> 21:43.390
l' th' air or th' earth?

21:43.800 --> 21:47.998
lt sounds no more: and sure,
it waits upon some god o' th' island

21:49.120 --> 21:54.478
Thence l have follow'd it,
or it hath drawn me rather

21:56.560 --> 21:59.154
but 'tis gone

22:01.000 --> 22:03.468
No, it begins again

22:09.360 --> 22:16.277
Full fathom five thy father lies

22:16.720 --> 22:23.193
of his bones are coral made

22:23.360 --> 22:31.153
Those are pearls that were his eyes

22:31.320 --> 22:35.518
nothing of him that doth fade

22:36.760 --> 22:46.635
but doth suffer a sea change

22:47.200 --> 22:54.880
into something rich

22:55.040 --> 22:59.272
and strange

23:01.440 --> 23:04.750
The ballard does remember
my drown'd father

23:04.920 --> 23:09.835
This is no mortal business, nor no
sound that the earth owes

23:10.000 --> 23:12.230
l hear it now above me

23:30.920 --> 23:34.515
The fringed curtains of thine eye
advance and say...

23:34.680 --> 23:37.274
say what thou seest yond

23:38.880 --> 23:41.440
What is't? A spirit?

23:41.600 --> 23:48.278
No, child: it eats and sleeps and hath
such senses as we have, such

23:48.960 --> 23:52.111
This gallant which thou seest
was in the wreck

23:52.280 --> 23:58.196
l might call him a thing divine, for
nothing natural l ever saw so noble

24:02.800 --> 24:07.157
lt goes on, l see, as my soul prompts it

24:07.520 --> 24:11.195
Oh spirit, fine spirit! l'll free
thee within two days for this

24:15.120 --> 24:18.829
Most sure, the goddess on whom
these airs attend!

24:19.000 --> 24:21.514
Vouchsafe my prayer may know if
you remain upon this island

24:21.760 --> 24:25.639
and that you will some good instruction
give how l may bear me here

24:26.240 --> 24:29.118
My prime request, which l
do last pronounce, is

24:30.360 --> 24:31.190
O you wonder!

24:32.320 --> 24:34.709
lf you be maid or no?

24:34.880 --> 24:37.838
No wonder, sir, but certainly a maid

24:38.040 --> 24:41.316
My language! Heavens!

24:41.840 --> 24:44.354
l am the best of them
that speak this speech

24:44.520 --> 24:47.080
were l but where 'tis spoken

24:47.240 --> 24:49.800
How? The best?

24:49.960 --> 24:53.077
What wert thou, if the King
of Naples heard thee?

24:53.240 --> 24:57.392
A single thing, as l am now, that
wonders to hear thee speak of Naples

24:58.440 --> 25:01.398
He does hear me
and that he does l weep

25:01.560 --> 25:03.596
myself am Naples

25:03.760 --> 25:09.630
who with mine eyes, never since at ebb
beheld the King my father wreck'd

25:09.800 --> 25:12.234
Alack, for mercy!

25:12.400 --> 25:15.551
Yes, faith, and all his lords

25:18.960 --> 25:22.589
At the first sight they have
changed eyes

25:23.480 --> 25:27.439
Delicate Ariel,
l'll set thee free for this

25:28.040 --> 25:29.712
A word, good sir

25:30.520 --> 25:33.512
l fear you have done yourself
some wrong. A word!

25:33.680 --> 25:35.910
Why speaks my mother so ungently?

25:36.080 --> 25:40.198
This is the second man that e'er l saw,
the first that e'er l sigh'd for

25:41.240 --> 25:44.277
They are both in either's powers

25:45.200 --> 25:47.236
but this swift business
l must uneasy make

25:47.400 --> 25:50.756
lest too light winning make the prize light

25:52.360 --> 25:53.475
One word more

25:53.640 --> 25:55.995
l charge thee that thou attend me

25:57.160 --> 26:00.994
Thou dost here usurp
the name thou ow'st not

26:01.160 --> 26:04.311
and hast put thyself
upon this island as a spy

26:04.480 --> 26:06.789
to win it from me, the sovereign on't

26:06.960 --> 26:07.756
No, as l am a man

26:07.920 --> 26:09.831
There's nothing ill can dwell in
such a temple

26:10.000 --> 26:13.037
Follow me. Speak not you for him:
he's a traitor

26:13.200 --> 26:15.760
Come! l'll manacle thy neck
and feet together

26:15.920 --> 26:18.036
sea-water shalt
thou drink. Follow!

26:18.200 --> 26:21.158
No. l will resist such entertainment
till mine enemy has more pow'r

26:21.320 --> 26:25.359
O dear mother, make not too rash a trial
of him, for he's gentle and not fearful

26:25.520 --> 26:28.512
What, l say, my foot my tutor?
Put thy sword up, traitor

26:28.800 --> 26:32.759
For l can here disarm thee with this
stick and make thy weapon drop

26:33.080 --> 26:34.718
- Beseech you, mother
- Hence! Hang not on my garments

26:34.880 --> 26:37.075
Ma'am, have pity. l'll be his surety

26:37.240 --> 26:41.233
Silence! One word more shall make
me chide thee, if not hate thee

26:42.760 --> 26:45.228
Thou think'st there is no more
such shapes as he

26:45.440 --> 26:47.431
having seen but him and Caliban

26:47.600 --> 26:48.828
Foolish child!

26:49.000 --> 26:51.833
To th' most of men this is a Caliban
and they to him are angels

26:52.000 --> 26:57.028
My affections are then most humble
l have no ambition to see a goodlier man

26:57.200 --> 26:59.350
Come on, obey!

27:00.000 --> 27:03.993
Thy nerves are in their infancy
again and have no vigour in them

27:04.160 --> 27:06.913
So they are

27:07.080 --> 27:11.596
My spirits, as in a dream,
are all bound up

27:12.280 --> 27:15.238
My father's loss, the weakness
which l feel

27:15.720 --> 27:19.759
the wreck of all my friends, nor this
dame's threats, to whom l am subdued

27:20.240 --> 27:21.798
are but light to me

27:22.160 --> 27:25.948
might l but through my prison
once a day behold this maid

27:26.240 --> 27:29.277
All corners else o' the earth
let liberty make use of

27:29.760 --> 27:32.228
Space enough have l in such a prison

27:33.760 --> 27:35.352
lt works

27:35.800 --> 27:37.552
Come on

27:53.000 --> 27:57.994
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
Hark what thou else shalt do me

27:59.080 --> 28:04.029
Be of comfort. My mother's of a better
nature, sir, than she appears by speech

28:06.160 --> 28:08.196
Thou shalt be free as mountain winds

28:08.680 --> 28:11.513
then exactly do all points
of my command

28:11.680 --> 28:13.272
To th' syllable

28:19.600 --> 28:22.751
Come, follow. Speak not for him

28:39.720 --> 28:43.554
Beseech you, sir, be merry

28:43.720 --> 28:47.156
you have cause, so have we all, of joy

28:47.400 --> 28:52.520
for our escape is much beyond our loss

28:53.240 --> 28:56.471
But for the miracle,
l mean our preservation

28:56.640 --> 28:58.949
few in millions can speak like us

28:59.120 --> 29:03.033
Then wisely, good sir, weigh our
sorrow with our comfort

29:03.200 --> 29:06.829
- Prithee, peace
- He receives comfort like cold porridge

29:07.000 --> 29:11.391
Look he's winding up the watch of
his wit: by and by it will strike

29:11.560 --> 29:15.075
- Sir
- One... Tell

29:15.400 --> 29:19.393
When every grief is entertain'd
that's offer'd

29:19.560 --> 29:23.235
- comes to the entertainer
- A dollar

29:23.400 --> 29:27.359
Dolour comes to him, indeed. You have
spoken truer than you purposed

29:27.520 --> 29:30.717
You have taken it wiselier
than l meant you should

29:30.880 --> 29:32.359
Therefore, my lord...

29:32.520 --> 29:34.988
Fie, what a spendthrift is he
of his tongue!

29:35.160 --> 29:38.357
- l prithee, spare
- Well...

29:38.880 --> 29:40.393
l have done

29:41.160 --> 29:45.119
- But yet...
- He will be talking!

29:45.520 --> 29:49.832
Though this island seem to be desert

29:50.000 --> 29:52.389
- Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
- Yet...

29:52.560 --> 29:55.199
- Yet
- He could not miss't

29:55.360 --> 29:58.397
The air breathes upon us here
most sweetly

29:58.560 --> 30:00.278
As if it had lungs, and rotten ones

30:00.440 --> 30:02.317
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen

30:02.480 --> 30:04.789
Here is everything advantageous to life

30:04.960 --> 30:06.393
True: save means to live

30:06.560 --> 30:08.198
Of that there's none, or little

30:08.360 --> 30:13.195
How lush and lusty the grass
looks! How green!

30:13.360 --> 30:15.715
The ground indeed is tawny

30:15.960 --> 30:20.238
With an eye of green in't

30:20.760 --> 30:25.231
But the rarity of it is, which is
indeed almost beyond credit

30:25.400 --> 30:28.358
that our garments, being,
as they were, drenched in the sea

30:28.520 --> 30:31.751
are now as fresh as when
we put them on first in Afric

30:33.360 --> 30:35.635
ln Tunis

30:35.800 --> 30:40.157
At the marriage of your fair daughter
Claribel to the King of Tunis

30:40.320 --> 30:44.313
You cram these words into mine ears
against the stomach of my sense

30:44.480 --> 30:49.474
Would l had never married my daughter
there! For, coming thence, my son is lost

30:49.640 --> 30:50.834
and, in my rate, she too

30:51.000 --> 30:54.754
who is so far from ltaly removed
l ne'er again shall see her

30:55.680 --> 30:58.114
O thou mine heir of Naples and of Milan

30:58.520 --> 31:01.273
what strange fish hath made
his meal on thee

31:01.440 --> 31:02.919
Sir, he may live

31:03.120 --> 31:07.113
l saw him beat the surges under him,
and ride upon their backs

31:07.280 --> 31:11.273
- l not doubt he came alive to land
- No, no, he's gone

31:11.440 --> 31:14.750
Sir, you may thank yourself
for this great loss

31:14.920 --> 31:16.911
that would not bless our Europe
with your daughter

31:17.080 --> 31:18.911
but rather lose her to an African

31:19.080 --> 31:20.069
Prithee, peace

31:20.520 --> 31:22.954
We have lost your son, l fear, for ever
The fault's your own

31:23.120 --> 31:26.032
So is the dear'st o' the loss

31:27.520 --> 31:32.196
My lord Sebastian, the truth you
speak doth lack some gentlenes

31:32.680 --> 31:35.114
You rub the sore, when you should
bring the plaster

31:35.280 --> 31:38.875
- Very well
- And most like a surgeon

31:39.920 --> 31:43.595
lt is foul weather in us all, good
sir, when you are cloudy

31:44.880 --> 31:46.950
Foul weather?

31:48.600 --> 31:50.318
Very foul

32:00.240 --> 32:04.472
Prospera! Prospera!

32:10.240 --> 32:16.429
All the infections that the sun
sucks up from bogs, fens, flats

32:16.600 --> 32:20.479
on Prospera fall and make her by
inchmeal a disease!

32:25.040 --> 32:28.032
Her spirits hear me

32:28.760 --> 32:31.911
And yet l needs must curse

32:35.240 --> 32:38.755
But for every trifle are they set upon me

32:39.120 --> 32:41.270
sometime like apes

32:41.440 --> 32:44.113
that mow

32:48.040 --> 32:52.670
and chatter at me and after bite me

32:52.840 --> 32:57.994
then like hedgehogs which lie
tumbling in my barefoot way

32:58.160 --> 33:03.393
and mount their pricks at my footfall

33:03.560 --> 33:07.030
Sometime... am l all wound...

33:07.200 --> 33:13.435
with adders who with cloven tongues
do hiss me into madness!

33:37.800 --> 33:40.678
Lo! Here comes a spirit of hers

33:40.840 --> 33:43.718
and to torment me for bringing
wood in slowly

33:51.480 --> 33:56.952
l'll fall flat. Perchance he will
not mind me

34:08.760 --> 34:13.675
Here's neither bush nor shrub,
to bear off any weather at all

34:13.840 --> 34:16.717
and another storm brewing

34:16.880 --> 34:18.552
l hear it sing i' the wind

34:20.159 --> 34:24.472
Yond same black cloud, yond huge one

34:24.639 --> 34:30.033
looks like a foul bombard that
would shed his liquor

34:32.880 --> 34:36.668
lf it should thunder as it did before

34:36.840 --> 34:38.909
l know not where to hide my head

34:39.199 --> 34:43.398
Yond same cloud cannot choose
but fall by pailfuls

34:46.159 --> 34:48.150
What have we here?

34:48.320 --> 34:51.277
A man or a fish?

34:51.440 --> 34:53.396
Dead or alive?

34:55.120 --> 34:57.588
A fish! He smells like a fish

34:57.760 --> 35:01.753
a very ancient fishlike smell

35:07.640 --> 35:10.996
A strange fish!

35:12.760 --> 35:16.514
Were l in England now, as once l was

35:16.680 --> 35:19.240
and had but this fish painted

35:19.400 --> 35:23.154
not a holiday fool there
but would give a piece of silver

35:23.360 --> 35:27.911
There would this monster make a man

35:28.080 --> 35:29.752
any strange beast there makes a man

35:29.920 --> 35:32.150
When they will not give a penny
to relieve a lame beggar

35:32.320 --> 35:36.871
they will lay out ten to see
a dead lndian

35:40.640 --> 35:42.710
Legged...

35:42.880 --> 35:46.190
like a man...

35:46.360 --> 35:51.388
and his fins like arms!

35:51.560 --> 35:56.156
Warm o' my troth!

35:56.320 --> 36:01.348
l do now let loose my opinion,
hold it no longer

36:02.240 --> 36:05.516
This is no fish

36:05.680 --> 36:10.879
but an islander, that hath lately
suffered by a thunderbolt

36:12.240 --> 36:15.073
Alas, the storm is come again!

36:15.240 --> 36:19.916
My best way is to creep
under his gaberdine

36:20.080 --> 36:23.152
there is no other shelter hereabouts

36:26.440 --> 36:31.514
Misery acquaints a man with
strange bedfellows

36:40.400 --> 36:43.278
Do not torment me! O!

36:45.160 --> 36:49.073
The master, the swabber,
the boatswain and l

36:49.240 --> 36:51.800
the gunner and his mate

36:52.200 --> 36:58.389
loved Mall, Meg and Marian
and Margery

36:58.560 --> 37:01.233
but none of us cared for Kate

37:01.400 --> 37:03.391
for she had a tongue with a tang

37:03.720 --> 37:06.518
would cry to a sailor, Go hang!

37:06.680 --> 37:10.832
She loved not the savour
of tar nor of pitch

37:11.000 --> 37:13.912
yet...

37:14.840 --> 37:18.833
yet a tailor might scratch her

37:19.000 --> 37:21.639
where'er she did itch

37:21.840 --> 37:27.278
then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!

37:27.440 --> 37:32.992
Then to sea, boys, and let her

37:35.120 --> 37:38.795
This is a very scurvy tune to sing
at a mans funeral

37:41.480 --> 37:45.075
Well, here's my comfort

37:48.680 --> 37:50.477
What's the matter?

37:54.840 --> 37:56.910
Have we devils here?

37:59.240 --> 38:03.119
Do you put tricks upon's with
savages and men of lnde, ha?

38:04.120 --> 38:09.592
l have not scaped drowning to be
afeard now of your four legs

38:10.200 --> 38:14.478
The spirit torments me. O!

38:14.640 --> 38:16.471
This is some monster of the isle
with four legs

38:16.640 --> 38:19.279
who hath got, as l take it, an ague

38:19.440 --> 38:22.079
Where the devil should he learn
our language?

38:22.800 --> 38:26.315
l will give him some relief
if it be but for that

38:26.680 --> 38:29.148
lf l can recover him, and keep him
tame and get to Naples with him

38:29.320 --> 38:30.833
he's a present for any emperor

38:31.600 --> 38:35.639
Do not torment me, prithee
l'll bring my wood home faster

38:35.800 --> 38:39.110
He's in his fit now and does not
talk after the wisest

38:39.920 --> 38:42.354
He shall taste of my bottle
Come on your ways

38:43.640 --> 38:50.079
Open your mouth. This will shake your
shaking l can tell you, and that soundly

38:52.360 --> 38:55.830
You cannot tell who's your friend
Open your chaps again

38:56.000 --> 39:00.994
l should know that voice! lt should be...
but he is drowned: and these are devils

39:01.160 --> 39:02.275
O, defend me

39:04.560 --> 39:07.757
Four legs and two voices a most
delicate monster!

39:07.920 --> 39:09.273
Come

39:10.520 --> 39:14.274
Amen! l will pour some
in thy other mouth

39:14.440 --> 39:17.238
Stephano!

39:17.400 --> 39:19.038
Doth thy other mouth call me?

39:19.240 --> 39:22.630
Mercy, mercy! This is a devil,
and no monster l will leave him

39:22.800 --> 39:26.475
Stephano! lf thou beest Stephano,
touch me and speak to me

39:26.640 --> 39:31.191
be not afeard, for l am Trinculo,
thy good friend Trinculo

39:31.360 --> 39:34.272
lf thou beest Trinculo, come forth

39:34.440 --> 39:37.034
l'll pull thee by the lesser legs

39:37.600 --> 39:40.672
lf any be Trinculo's legs, these are they

39:43.960 --> 39:46.190
Thou art very Trinculo indeed!

39:46.440 --> 39:50.228
How camest thou to be the siege of this
mooncalf? Can he vent Trinculos?

39:50.400 --> 39:53.278
l took him to be killed with
a thunder-stroke

39:53.440 --> 39:55.670
But art thou not drowned, Stephano?

39:55.880 --> 40:00.158
l hid me under the dead moon-calfs
gaberdine for fear of the storm

40:00.320 --> 40:03.198
And art thou living, Stephano?

40:03.360 --> 40:07.273
O Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!

40:08.320 --> 40:13.519
Prithee, do not turn me about
my stomach is not constant

40:13.920 --> 40:17.356
These be fine things,
an if they be not sprites

40:17.520 --> 40:21.832
That's a brave god and bears
celestial liquor

40:22.000 --> 40:23.558
l will kneel to him

40:23.720 --> 40:26.951
How didst thou 'scape?
How camest thou hither?

40:27.120 --> 40:28.951
Swear by this bottle
how thou cam'st hither

40:29.120 --> 40:33.120
l escaped upon a butt of sack
which the sailors heaved o'erboard

40:33.120 --> 40:37.910
l'll swear upon that bottle
to be thy true subject

40:38.080 --> 40:40.548
for the liquor is not earthly

40:40.720 --> 40:43.154
Here! Swear by this bottle
how thou escapedst

40:43.320 --> 40:46.995
Swum ashore, man, like a duck
l can swim like a duck, l'll be sworn

40:47.160 --> 40:49.833
Here, kiss the book

40:50.320 --> 40:53.596
Though thou canst swim like a
duck, thou art made like a goose

40:55.080 --> 40:57.469
O Stephano. Hast thou any
more of this?

40:58.120 --> 40:59.314
The whole butt, man

41:00.840 --> 41:04.879
How now, mooncalf!

41:05.440 --> 41:07.271
How does thine ague?

41:08.120 --> 41:09.872
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?

41:12.600 --> 41:16.229
Out o' th' moon, l do assure thee

41:16.400 --> 41:19.517
l was the Man i' the Moon
when time was

41:20.040 --> 41:22.349
l have seen thee in her

41:22.520 --> 41:24.954
and l do adore thee

41:25.120 --> 41:27.680
Come, swear to that

41:28.960 --> 41:31.269
Kiss the book. Swear

41:32.560 --> 41:37.953
By this good light, this is a very
shallow monster!

41:38.120 --> 41:41.669
l afeard of him? A very weak monster!

41:41.840 --> 41:46.709
The Man i' the Moon! A most poor
credulous monster!

41:47.160 --> 41:53.156
l'll show thee every fertile inch
o' th' island

41:53.320 --> 41:54.958
And l will kiss thy foot

41:55.560 --> 41:58.632
l prithee, be my god

42:00.160 --> 42:03.789
Come on then
Down, and swear!

42:07.600 --> 42:11.036
l shall laugh myself to death
at this puppy-headed monster

42:11.200 --> 42:13.555
A most scurvy monster!

42:13.720 --> 42:15.870
l could find in my heart to beat him

42:16.920 --> 42:21.835
- But that the poor monster's in drink
- Come, kiss

42:29.440 --> 42:34.309
l'll show thee the best springs

42:35.120 --> 42:38.032
l'll pluck thee berries

42:38.320 --> 42:43.075
l'll fish for thee
and get thee wood enough

42:43.400 --> 42:47.154
A plague upon the tyrant that l serve!
l'll bear her no more sticks

42:47.320 --> 42:50.437
but follow thee thou wondrous man

42:50.600 --> 42:55.754
A most ridiculous monster
to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!

42:55.920 --> 42:58.878
l prithee, let me bring thee
where crabs grow

42:59.640 --> 43:03.792
and l with my long nails will dig
thee pignuts

43:03.960 --> 43:05.996
show thee a jay's nest

43:06.160 --> 43:09.709
and instruct thee how to snare
the nimble marmoset

43:10.640 --> 43:13.598
l'll bring thee to clust'ring filberts

43:13.760 --> 43:18.117
and sometimes l'll get thee young
scamels from the rock

43:18.280 --> 43:19.269
Wilt thou go with me?

43:19.560 --> 43:23.075
l prithee now, lead the way without
any more talking, Trinculo

43:24.560 --> 43:27.279
The King and all our company else
being drowned, we will inherit here

43:27.440 --> 43:30.910
Farewell master: farewell, farewell!

43:31.080 --> 43:33.992
A howling monster!
A drunken monster!

43:34.160 --> 43:36.628
No more dams l'll make for fish

43:36.800 --> 43:39.837
nor fetch in firing at requiring

43:40.000 --> 43:43.629
nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish

43:43.800 --> 43:47.554
'Ban, 'Ban
Ca- Ca- Ca- Ca- Caliban

43:47.720 --> 43:50.598
has a new master

43:50.760 --> 43:52.398
Get a new man!

43:52.560 --> 43:56.678
Freedom, high day!
High day, freedom!

43:57.120 --> 43:59.509
Freedom, high day,
high day freedom!

43:59.680 --> 44:03.275
O brave monster! Lead the way

44:36.440 --> 44:40.911
This my mean task
would be as heavy to me as odious

44:41.080 --> 44:44.629
but the mistress which l serve
quickens what's dead

44:44.800 --> 44:48.429
and makes my labours... pleasures

44:52.200 --> 44:55.909
She is ten times more gentle than
her mother's crabbed

44:56.320 --> 44:59.198
and she's composed of harshness!

44:59.360 --> 45:02.477
l must remove some thousands
of these logs

45:02.640 --> 45:06.235
and pile them up,
upon a sore injunction

45:09.200 --> 45:12.192
My sweet mistress weeps
when she sees me work

45:12.840 --> 45:16.310
and says, such baseness
had never like executor

45:19.240 --> 45:23.995
l forget: but these sweet thoughts
do even refresh my labours

45:24.160 --> 45:26.594
most busiest, when l do work

45:43.640 --> 45:47.269
Alas, now, pray you, work not so hard!

45:47.440 --> 45:51.115
l would the lightning had burnt up those
logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!

45:51.280 --> 45:53.589
Pray, set it down and rest you

45:54.320 --> 45:57.596
When this burns, 'twill weep
for having wearied you

45:57.760 --> 45:59.830
My mother is hard at study

46:00.000 --> 46:02.116
pray now, rest yourself
she's safe for these three hours

46:02.280 --> 46:03.952
O most dear mistress, the sun will set

46:04.120 --> 46:05.997
before l shall discharge
what l must strive to do

46:06.160 --> 46:08.037
lf you'll sit down, l'll bear your
logs the while

46:08.800 --> 46:10.279
Pray, give me that: l'll carry it to the pile

46:10.440 --> 46:14.035
No, precious creature, l had rather
crack my sinews, break my back

46:14.200 --> 46:16.794
than you should such dishonour
undergo, while l sit lazy by

46:16.960 --> 46:18.393
lt would become me as well
as it does you

46:18.560 --> 46:20.198
and l should do it with much more ease

46:20.360 --> 46:25.753
for my good will is to it,
and yours it is against

46:31.400 --> 46:33.960
You look wearily

46:34.480 --> 46:38.678
No, noble mistress 'tis fresh morning
with me when you are by at night

46:40.320 --> 46:43.039
l do beseech you, what is your name?

46:43.200 --> 46:47.159
Miranda. O my mother,
l have broke your hest to say so!

46:47.640 --> 46:49.676
Admired Miranda!

46:49.840 --> 46:54.391
lndeed the top of admiration!
Worth what's dearest to the world!

46:54.560 --> 46:59.759
Poor worm, thou art infected!
This visitation shows it

47:00.320 --> 47:03.278
Full many a lady l have eyed
with best regard

47:03.440 --> 47:05.795
and many a time the harmony of their
tongues hath into bondage brought

47:05.960 --> 47:06.836
my too diligent ear

47:07.640 --> 47:10.598
For several virtues have l liked
several women

47:10.760 --> 47:14.309
never any with so full soul

47:14.480 --> 47:17.756
but some defect in her did quarrel
with the noblest grace she owed

47:17.920 --> 47:20.354
and put it to the foil

47:20.560 --> 47:21.231
But you...

47:24.080 --> 47:29.154
O you, so perfect and so peerless

47:30.000 --> 47:33.072
are created of every creature's best!

47:33.240 --> 47:37.358
l know only one more of my sex
no young woman's face remember

47:37.520 --> 47:40.557
save from my glass, mine own
nor have l seen

47:40.720 --> 47:43.951
more that l may call men than you,
good friend

47:44.120 --> 47:48.272
how features are abroad, l am
skilless of: but, by my modesty

47:48.720 --> 47:51.154
l would not wish any companion
in the world but you

47:52.840 --> 47:57.834
nor can imagination form a shape,
besides yourself, to like of

47:58.440 --> 48:01.318
But l prattle something too wildly
and my mother's precepts

48:01.480 --> 48:02.708
l therein do forget

48:03.720 --> 48:06.917
l am in my condition a prince,
Miranda

48:07.280 --> 48:11.671
l do think, a king l would, not so

48:11.920 --> 48:13.797
Hear my soul speak!

48:14.000 --> 48:18.869
The very instant that l saw you,
did my heart fly to your service

48:19.320 --> 48:22.039
there resides, to make me slave to it

48:23.680 --> 48:27.150
and for your sake am l this
patient log-man

48:28.480 --> 48:30.675
Do you love me?

48:32.520 --> 48:36.991
O heaven, O earth,
bear witness to this sound

48:40.720 --> 48:43.632
l beyond all limit of what else i' th' world

48:43.800 --> 48:49.591
Do love, prize, honour you

48:49.760 --> 48:52.433
l am a fool

48:53.280 --> 48:55.840
To weep at what l am glad of

48:56.240 --> 48:59.118
Wherefore weep you?

48:59.280 --> 49:03.114
At mine unworthiness
which dare not offer

49:03.400 --> 49:08.520
what l desire to give and much less
take what l shall die to want

49:08.680 --> 49:10.193
But this is trifling

49:10.440 --> 49:14.877
and all the more it seeks to hide itself,
the bigger bulk it shows

49:15.040 --> 49:20.239
Hence, bashful cunning, and prompt me,
plain and holy innocence!

49:22.240 --> 49:26.313
l am your wife, if you will marry me

49:26.480 --> 49:28.516
lf not, l'll die your maid

49:28.680 --> 49:29.829
To be your fellow you may deny me

49:30.040 --> 49:31.837
but l'll be your servant whether
you will or no

49:32.760 --> 49:36.070
My mistress, dearest
And l thus humble ever

49:36.240 --> 49:38.276
My husband, then?

49:38.440 --> 49:43.514
Ay, with a heart as willing as
bondage e'er of freedom

49:44.560 --> 49:48.109
- Here's my hand
- And mine

49:48.280 --> 49:51.829
with my heart in't

49:58.480 --> 50:01.119
and now farewell

50:02.600 --> 50:04.909
Till half an hour hence

50:05.080 --> 50:08.755
A thousand thousand!

50:32.000 --> 50:36.278
Had l plantation of this isle,
my lord and were the king on't

50:36.440 --> 50:37.350
what would l do?

50:37.520 --> 50:40.557
'Scape being drunk for want of wine

50:40.760 --> 50:45.311
No occupation: all men idle,
all and women too

50:45.480 --> 50:47.471
but innocent and pure: no sovereignty

50:47.640 --> 50:49.198
Yet he would be king on't

50:49.360 --> 50:52.557
The latter end of his common
wealth forgets the beginning

50:52.760 --> 50:53.909
Nature...

50:54.080 --> 50:58.596
Nature, without sweat or endeavour
would bring forth, of its own kind

50:58.800 --> 51:01.872
all foison, all abundance
to feed my innocent people

51:02.200 --> 51:06.716
- No marrying 'mong his subjects?
- None, man, all idle

51:06.880 --> 51:07.949
whores and knaves

51:08.120 --> 51:12.318
l would with such perfection govern,
sir, t'excel the Golden Age

51:12.600 --> 51:15.717
- God save his majesty!
- Long live Gonzalo!

51:15.880 --> 51:18.235
And, do you mark me, sir?

51:18.400 --> 51:21.597
Prithee, no more
Thou dost talk nothing to me

51:21.760 --> 51:23.079
l do well believe your Majesty

51:23.240 --> 51:25.834
and did it to minister occasion
to these gentlemen

51:26.000 --> 51:28.912
who are of such sensible
and nimble lungs

51:29.080 --> 51:30.479
that they always use
to laugh at nothing

51:30.640 --> 51:32.039
'Twas you we laughed at

51:32.200 --> 51:35.954
Who in this kind of merry fooling am
nothing to you so you may continue

51:36.120 --> 51:37.314
and laugh at nothing still

51:37.480 --> 51:40.358
What a blow was there given!

51:40.520 --> 51:42.556
Nay, good my lord, be not angry

51:42.720 --> 51:48.909
No, l warrant you: l will not
adventure my discretion so weakly

51:53.760 --> 51:56.797
Will you laugh me asleep?

51:57.600 --> 52:02.151
l am very heavy

52:02.880 --> 52:05.633
Go sleep, and hear us

52:05.800 --> 52:09.236
What, so soon asleep?

52:09.400 --> 52:13.916
l wish mine eyes would, with
themselves, shut up my thoughts

52:14.080 --> 52:17.789
l find they are inclined to do so

52:19.160 --> 52:21.071
Do not omit the heavy offer of it

52:21.240 --> 52:25.199
lt seldom visits sorrow
when it doth, it is a comforter

52:25.360 --> 52:27.476
We two, my lord, will guard your person

52:27.640 --> 52:29.949
while you take your rest
and watch your safety

52:30.120 --> 52:34.750
Thank you! Wondrous heavy

52:40.280 --> 52:43.033
What a strange drowsiness
possesses them!

52:43.200 --> 52:45.589
lt is the quality o' th' climate

52:45.760 --> 52:47.796
Why doth it not then our eyelids sink?

52:48.440 --> 52:53.912
- l find not myself disposed to sleep
- Nor l my spirits are nimble

52:54.160 --> 53:00.679
They fell together, as by consent
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke

53:00.840 --> 53:06.676
What might, worthy Sebastian
O, what might?

53:07.520 --> 53:08.919
No more!

53:09.800 --> 53:12.872
And yet methinks l see it in thy
face, what thou shouldst be

53:13.520 --> 53:14.794
Th' occasion speaks thee

53:15.000 --> 53:19.471
and my strong imagination sees
a crown dropping upon thy head

53:19.640 --> 53:21.232
What? Art thou waking?

53:21.400 --> 53:23.038
Do you not hear me speak?

53:23.200 --> 53:29.309
l do, and surely it is a sleepy language
and thou speak'st out of thy sleep

53:32.080 --> 53:33.069
What is it thou didst say?

53:34.480 --> 53:39.110
This is a strange repose,
to be asleep with eyes wide open

53:39.280 --> 53:42.113
standing, speaking, moving

53:42.280 --> 53:43.793
and yet so fast asleep

53:43.960 --> 53:49.990
Noble Sebastian, thou let'st
thy fortune sleep, die, rather

53:50.160 --> 53:52.594
wink'st whiles thou art waking

53:52.760 --> 53:56.230
Thou dost snore distinctly

53:58.080 --> 53:59.433
there's meaning in thy snores

53:59.600 --> 54:01.875
l am more serious than my custom

54:02.040 --> 54:06.556
You must be so too, if heed me
which to do trebles thee o'er

54:06.720 --> 54:10.952
Well, l am standing water

54:11.120 --> 54:13.588
l'll teach you how to flow

54:13.760 --> 54:17.753
Do so. To ebb hereditary
sloth instructs me

54:17.920 --> 54:19.069
Thus, sir

54:19.280 --> 54:23.478
Although this lord hath here almost
persuaded the king his son's alive

54:23.640 --> 54:27.633
'tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
as he that sleeps here swims

54:27.800 --> 54:28.949
l have no hope that he's undrown'd

54:29.120 --> 54:31.839
O, out of that no hope what great
hope have you!

54:32.440 --> 54:35.477
No hope that way is another way
so high a hope

54:35.800 --> 54:40.112
that even ambition cannot pierce a wink
beyond but doubt discovery there

54:40.280 --> 54:43.272
Will you grant with me
that Ferdinand is drown'd?

54:43.440 --> 54:44.873
- He's gone
- Then, tell me

54:45.040 --> 54:47.395
Who's the next heir of Naples?

54:48.920 --> 54:50.956
- Claribel
- She that is Queen of Tunis

54:51.120 --> 54:53.759
she that dwells ten leagues
beyond man's life

54:53.920 --> 54:57.959
she that from whom we all were
sea-swallow'd though some cast again

54:58.120 --> 55:02.557
and, by that destiny, to perform an act
whereof what's past is prologue

55:02.720 --> 55:06.110
what to come in yours
and my discharge

55:06.280 --> 55:08.032
What stuff is this? How say you?

55:08.200 --> 55:12.318
Say, this were death that now
hath seized them

55:12.480 --> 55:14.232
why, they were no worse
than now they are

55:14.400 --> 55:18.518
There be that can rule Naples as
well as he that sleeps

55:18.720 --> 55:21.678
O, that you bore the mind that l do!

55:21.840 --> 55:24.991
What a sleep were this for your
advancement! Do you understand me?

55:25.160 --> 55:25.990
Methinks l do

55:26.160 --> 55:30.551
And how does your content tender
your own good fortune?

55:32.280 --> 55:34.714
l remember you did supplant
your sister Prospera

55:34.880 --> 55:38.316
True. And look how well my
garments sit upon me

55:40.280 --> 55:42.350
My sister's servants
were then my fellows

55:42.520 --> 55:44.078
now they are my men

55:47.160 --> 55:49.833
- But, for your conscience
- Ay, sir: where lies that?

55:50.000 --> 55:52.594
Twenty consciences, that stand
'twixt me and Milan

55:52.760 --> 55:56.036
candied be they and melt,
ere they molest!

55:56.200 --> 56:00.239
Here lies your brother, no better
than the earth he lies upon

56:00.400 --> 56:02.834
lf he were that which now
he's like, that's dead

56:03.000 --> 56:08.199
Whom l, with this obedient steel three
inches of it can lay to bed forever

56:08.360 --> 56:11.830
whiles you, doing thus,
to this ancient morsel

56:12.000 --> 56:15.709
this Sir prudence
who should not upbraid our course

56:15.880 --> 56:18.110
Thy case, dear friend,
shall be my precedent

56:18.280 --> 56:20.874
As thou got'st Milan,
l'll come by Naples

56:21.040 --> 56:24.919
Draw thy sword. One stroke shall free
thee from the tribute which thou payest

56:25.080 --> 56:29.756
and l the King shall love thee

56:32.680 --> 56:38.118
Draw together, and when l rear my
hand, do you the like

56:38.280 --> 56:41.477
to fall it on Gonzalo

56:51.920 --> 56:55.833
While you here do snoring lie

56:56.000 --> 56:58.878
open-eyed conspiracy

56:59.400 --> 57:03.188
his time doth take

57:03.360 --> 57:07.069
lf of life you keep a care

57:07.240 --> 57:11.313
shake off slumber and beware

57:11.480 --> 57:13.550
Awake! awake!

57:16.080 --> 57:17.069
Good angels preserve the King

57:17.240 --> 57:18.036
Why?

57:19.640 --> 57:21.153
Why are you drawn?

57:21.320 --> 57:22.594
Wherefore this ghastly looking?

57:22.760 --> 57:23.556
What's the matter?

57:23.720 --> 57:26.871
Whiles we stood here securing
your repose even now

57:27.040 --> 57:29.952
we heard a hollow burst
of bellowing like bulls

57:30.120 --> 57:31.599
or rather lions

57:31.760 --> 57:34.479
Did't not wake you?
lt struck mine ear most terribly

57:34.640 --> 57:37.393
- l heard nothing
- O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear

57:37.560 --> 57:38.675
to make an earthquake!

57:38.840 --> 57:39.829
Heard you this, Gonzalo?

57:40.120 --> 57:43.556
Upon mine honour, sir, l heard a
humming, which did awake me

57:43.720 --> 57:46.712
As mine eyes open'd,
l saw their weapons drawn

57:47.360 --> 57:49.999
'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
or that we quit this place

57:50.200 --> 57:51.952
Let's draw our weapons

57:53.160 --> 57:54.957
Lead off this ground

57:55.120 --> 57:58.271
and let's make further search
for my poor son

58:00.080 --> 58:02.674
Lead away

58:12.160 --> 58:15.038
Now Prospera shall
know what l have done

58:15.200 --> 58:18.351
So, King, go safely on to seek thy son

58:24.480 --> 58:25.230
You're blind drunk!

58:25.400 --> 58:30.030
Tell not me! When the butt is out, we will
drink water: not a drop before

58:30.200 --> 58:34.398
Therefore bear up, and board 'em
Servant-monster, drink to me

58:35.080 --> 58:38.231
Servant monster?
The folly of this island!

58:38.400 --> 58:41.631
They say there's but five upon
this isle; we are three of them

58:41.800 --> 58:44.553
lf th' other two be brained like
us, the state totters

58:46.240 --> 58:51.075
Mooncalf, speak once in thy life,
if thou beest a good mooncalf

58:51.240 --> 58:52.878
How does thy honour?

58:54.200 --> 58:57.715
Let me lick thy shoe
l'll not serve him

58:57.880 --> 58:58.995
he's not valiant

58:59.160 --> 59:03.392
Thou liest, most ignorant monster

59:03.560 --> 59:06.950
Why, thou deboshed fish thou

59:07.120 --> 59:12.592
Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but
half a fish and half a monster?

59:12.760 --> 59:15.354
Lo, how he mocks me!

59:15.520 --> 59:17.397
Wilt thou let him, my lord?

59:17.560 --> 59:21.758
Lord quoth he! That a monster
should be such a natural!

59:21.920 --> 59:25.151
Lo, lo, again! bite him
to death, l prithee

59:25.320 --> 59:27.595
Trinculo, keep a good
tongue in your head

59:28.000 --> 59:31.879
lf you prove a mutineer... the next tree!

59:32.400 --> 59:36.518
The poor monster's my subject
and he shall not suffer indignity

59:36.680 --> 59:39.478
l thank my noble lord

59:40.920 --> 59:46.040
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once
again to the suit l made to thee?

59:46.200 --> 59:48.953
Marry, will l. Kneel and repeat it

59:49.120 --> 59:53.477
l will stand, and so shall Trinculo

59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.192
As l told thee before

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.275
l am subject to a tyrant, a sorceress

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.989
that by her cunning hath cheated
me of the island

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.510
Thou liest

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.679
Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.073
l do not lie

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.073
Trinculo, if you trouble him any
more in's tale by this hand

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.912
l will supplant some of your teeth

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.559
Why, l said nothing

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.678
Mum, then, and no more

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.432
Proceed

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.394
l say, by sorcery she got this isle

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.628
from me she got it

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.034
lf thy greatness will revenge it on her

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.910
thou shalt be lord of it
and l'll serve thee

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.750
How now shall this be compassed?
Canst thou bring me to the party?

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.958
Yea, yea, my lord!

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.797
l'll yield her thee asleep, where thou
mayst knock a nail into her head

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.034
Thou liest: thou canst not

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:09.233
What a pied ninny's this!
Thou scurvy patch!

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.029
l do beseech thy greatness, give him
blows and take his bottle from him

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.354
Why, what did l? l did nothing
l'll go farther off

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.158
Didst thou not just say he lied?

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.639
Thou liest

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.555
Do l so? Take thou that. As you like
this, give me the lie another time

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.632
Why? l did not give the lie

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.268
Out o' your wits and bearing too?
A pox o' your bottle!

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.839
And the devil take your fingers!

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.510
Now...

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.114
forward with your tale

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.352
- Prithee
- Stand farther off

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.077
Come, proceed

01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:00.792
Why, as l told thee, 'tis a custom with
her, l' th'late afternoon to sleep

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.474
there thou mayst brain her

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.760
having first seized her books
or with a log batter her skull

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:12.674
or paunch her with a stake
or cut her wezand with thy knife

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.279
But remember first
to possess her books

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.910
for without them she's but a sot,
as l am

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.119
nor hath not one spirit to command

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:31.479
they all do hate her as rootedly as l

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:35.110
Burn but her books

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.793
And that most deeply to consider

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.714
is the beauty of her daughter

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.476
Of women l've seen but these
and Sycorax my dam

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.872
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.076
as great'st does least

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.835
ls it so brave a lass?

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.633
Ay, lord

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.031
she will become thy bed, l warrant

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.830
And bring thee forth brave brood

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.472
Monster, l will kill this witch

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.391
her daughter and l will be King
and Queen

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.872
and Trinculo and thyself shall be
viceroys

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.915
Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.593
Excellent

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.159
Give me thy hand

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.756
l am sorry l beat thee

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.112
Within this half hour will she be asleep

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.759
Wilt thou destroy her then?

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.388
Ay, on mine honour

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.559
This will l tell my master

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.638
Thou makest me merry
l am full of pleasure

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.119
Come on, Trinculo, let us sing

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.475
Flout 'em and scout 'em
and scout 'em and flout 'em

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.235
Thought is free! Grog 'em then flog 'em
and flog 'em and grog 'em

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.628
Thought is free

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.756
Nab 'em and stab 'em,
stab 'em and nab 'em

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.035
Thought is free

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.111
Bag 'em and hang 'em,
hang 'em and bag 'em

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.599
Thought is free

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.833
Play 'em and flay 'em, flay 'em
and play 'em. Thought is free

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.800
What is this same?

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.836
lf thou beest a man, show thyself

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.709
O, forgive me my sins!

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.790
Mercy upon us!

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.436
Art thou afeard?

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.953
No, monster, not l

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:45.350
Be not afeard: the isle is full of noises

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.958
sounds and sweet airs, that give
delight and hurt not

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:58.072
Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.715
and sometime voices that, if l
then had waked after long sleep

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.758
will make me sleep again

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:13.670
and then, in dreaming,
the clouds methought would open

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:18.152
and show riches ready to drop
upon me that, when l waked

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.558
l cried to dream again

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.316
This will prove a brave kingdom to me,
where l shall have my music for nothing

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.356
When Prospera is destroyed

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.358
By'r Lakin

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.477
l can go no further, sir
l needs must rest me

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:04.270
Old lord, l cannot blame thee, who
am myself attach'd with weariness

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.749
Sit down, and rest

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.798
He is drown'd whom thus
we stray to find

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.555
and the sea mocks our frustrate
search on land

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.517
Well, let him go

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.989
l am right glad
that he's so out of hope

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.390
The next advantage will we take
thoroughly

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.073
Let it be tonight

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.678
What harmony is this?
My good friends, hark!

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.518
Marvellous sweet music!

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.590
Give us kind keepers, heavens!

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.151
A living drollery

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.232
Now l will believe
that there are unicorns

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.795
lf in Naples, l should report this
now, would they believe me?

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.876
We have stomachs

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.997
Will't please you taste of what is here?

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.273
Faith, sir, you need not fear

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:20.513
l will stand to and feed
although my last, no matter

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.432
since l feel the best is past

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.271
You are three men of sin!

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:51.191
Whom destiny hath caused
to belch up you

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.676
and on this island where man doth
not inhabit

01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:00.511
you 'mongst men being
most unfit to live

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.558
l have made you mad

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:12.793
You fools! l and my fellows
are ministers of fate

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.518
the elements

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.232
of whom your swords are temper'd may
as well wound the loud winds

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:24.428
as diminish one dowle
that's in my plume

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.196
But remember

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.157
for that's my business to you

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:38.598
that you three from Milan did
supplant good Prospera

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:42.233
her and her innocent child

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:46.916
for which foul deed the powers,
delaying, not forgetting

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:51.198
have incensed the seas and shores

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:56.514
yea, all the creatures,
against your peace

01:08:58.359 --> 01:09:02.319
Thee of thy son, Alonso,
they have bereft

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:06.473
and do pronounce
by me lingering perdition

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.237
shall step by step attend you
and your ways

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.077
Bravely the figure of this harpy
hast thou perform'd, my Ariel

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:27.272
My high charms work

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:30.876
and these mine enemies are all
knit up in their distractions

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.157
they now are in my pow'r

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.795
l' the name of something holy, sir

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.997
why stand you in this strange stare?

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.357
O, it is monstrous, monstrous!

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.353
Methought the billows spoke
and told me of it

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.670
the winds did sing it to me

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:53.475
and the thunder

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.309
that deep and dreadful organ pipe
pronounced the name of Prospera

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.198
it did bass my trespass

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.712
Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.351
and l'll seek him deeper than e'er
plummet sounded

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.111
and with him there lie mudded

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.075
But one fiend at a time,
l'll fight their legions o'er

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.799
l'll be thy second

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.520
All three of them are desperate

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.629
their great guilt, like poison
given to work a great time after

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.549
now 'gins to bite the spirits

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.395
l shall follow them swiftly
and hinder them

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.917
from what this ecstasy may
now provoke them to

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.909
lf l have too austerely punish'd you,
your compensation makes amends

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.550
for l have given you here a third
of mine own life

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.431
or that for which l live

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.836
all thy vexations were but
my trials of thy love

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.673
and thou hast strangely stood the test

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.158
O Ferdinand, do not smile at me
that l boast of her

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:18.111
for thou shalt find she will outstrip all
praise and make it halt behind her

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.869
l do believe it against an oracle

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:26.637
Then, as my gift and thine own
acquisition worthily purchased

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.029
take my daughter

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:52.157
But lf thou dost break her virgin-knot
before all sanctimonious ceremonies

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.711
no sweet aspersion shall the heavens
let fall to make this contract grow

01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:00.469
As l hope for quiet days,
fair issue and long life

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.555
the strongest temptation shall
never melt mine honour into lust

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.593
Fairly spoke

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.398
Sit then and talk with her

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.956
she is thine own

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.189
Monster, your fairy
which you say is a harmless fairy

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.271
has done little better than played
the Jack with us

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:35.719
Monster, l do smell all horse-piss, at
which my nose is in great indignation

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.393
So is mine. Do you hear, monster?

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:41.113
Good my lord, give me thy favour still

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.999
Ay, but to lose our bottles
in the pool

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.276
There is not only disgrace
and dishonour in that, monster

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.317
but an infinite loss

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:54.197
That's more to me than my wetting. Yet
all this is your harmless fairy, monster

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.991
What, Ariel!

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.398
My industrious servant

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.238
- Ariel!
-What would my potent master?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:11.955
Here l am

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.079
Go bring the rabble, o'er whom l give
thee pow'r, here to this place

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.468
lncite them to quick motion

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.152
for l must bestow upon the eyes
of this young couple

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.154
some vanity of mine art; it is my promise
and they expect it from me

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.311
- Presently?
- Ay, with a twink

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.755
Before you can say ''Come' and Go''!

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.399
Do you love me, master?

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.874
No?

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.476
Dearly my delicate Ariel

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:53.111
O mistress mine, where are you
roaming ?

01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:03.356
Oh stay and hear!
Your true love's coming

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:10.478
that can sing both high and low

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:18.991
trip no further, pretty sweeting,
journey's end in lover's meeting

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:25.918
every wise man's son doth know

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:30.119
What is love? Tis not hereafter

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.717
present mirth hath present laughter

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:41.399
what's to come is still unsure

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.553
in delay there lies no plenty

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.793
then come kiss me,
sweet-and-twenty

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.236
youth's a stuff...

01:14:53.400 --> 01:15:03.878
... will not endure, will not endure

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.916
Look thou be true

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.838
Do not give dalliance too much the rein

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.197
the strongest oaths are straw
to the fire i' th' blood

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.236
l warrant you madam

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.951
The white cold virgin snow upon my
heart abates the ardour of my liver

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.959
Well...

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:32.519
No tongue! All eyes! Be silent

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.838
l had forgot that foul conspiracy
of the beast Caliban

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:38.793
and his confederates
against my life

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.915
Avoid! No more! No more!

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.270
This is strange. Your mother's in some
passion that works her strongly

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:58.036
Never till this day saw l her
touch'd with anger so distemper'd

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.358
You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
as if you were dismay'd be cheerful, sir

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.875
Our revels now are ended

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.355
These our actors, as l foretold you,
were all spirits

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.514
and are melted into air
into thin air

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.355
and, like the baseless fabric
of this vision

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:29.277
the cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous
palaces, the solemn temples

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:36.116
the great globe itself, yea, all which
it inherit shall dissolve

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.991
and, like this insubstantial
pageant faded

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.034
leave not a rack behind

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.431
We are such stuff
as dreams are made on

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.752
and our little life is rounded with a sleep

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.792
Sir, l am vex'd

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.591
lf you be pleased, retire into my cell
and there repose

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.230
a turn or two l'll walk, to still
my beating mind

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.994
We wish your peace

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.198
Come with a thought!

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.359
l thank thee, Ariel. Come

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.874
What's thy pleasure?

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.715
Spirit. We must prepare
to meet with Caliban

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:31.915
Ay, my commander

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.753
Say again, where didst thou leave
these varlets?

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.276
l told you, ma'am, they were
red-hot with drinking

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.908
l left them l' the filthy-mantled
pool beyond your cell

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:45.870
There dancing up to the chins,
that the foul lake outstunk their feet

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.558
This was well done, my bird

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.071
The trumpery in my house, go put it
out, for stale to catch these thieves

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.674
l go, l go

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:05.231
A devil, a born devil

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.119
on whose nature nurture
can never stick

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:15.197
on whom my pains, humanely taken
all, all lost, quite lost!

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.796
l will plague them all, even to roaring

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:29.832
Pray you, tread softly
We now are near her cell

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.034
O no

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:44.955
Prithee, be quiet. Seest thou here?
This is the mouth o' the cell

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.236
Give me thy hand. l do begin to
have bloody thoughts

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:09.029
O King Stephano! O worthy Stephano!

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.634
Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.633
Let it alone, thou fool!
lt is but trash

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.634
O, ho, monster! We know what
belongs to a frippery

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.593
O king Stephano!

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.149
Put off that gown, Trinculo!
By this hand, l'll have that gown

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.959
Thy Grace shall have it

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.957
l look a dream, don't l

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.076
How can it be real

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.870
Look at the business, Gov'ner

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.674
What do you mean to dote
thus on such luggage?

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.671
Let's alone and do the murder first

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.195
Be you quiet, monster

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.273
Mistress line, is not this my jerkin?

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.559
Do, do! We steal by line and level

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.676
and't like your Grace

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.757
l thank thee for that jest
Here's a garment for't

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:17.198
Wit shall not go unrewarded
while l am king of this country

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:20.950
Monster, come, put some lime upon
your fingers, and away with the rest

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:25.193
l will have none on't. We shall lose our
time, and all be turned to barnacles

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:31.390
Monster, lay-on your fingers,
or l'll turn thee from my kingdom

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.870
- Go to, carry this
- And this

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.951
Ay, and this

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.197
Hey, Mountain, hey!

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:43.910
Silver!

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.837
Fury, Fury!
There, tyrant, there!

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.753
Hark!

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:03.636
They roar!

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:20.117
Let them be hunted soundly

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:28.509
At this hour lie at my mercy
all mine enemies

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.548
Now does my project gather to a head

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:38.036
Shortly shall all my labours end

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:42.557
and thou shalt have the air at freedom

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:56.155
Say, my spirit, how fares the King
and 's followers?

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.072
Just as you left them

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.390
All prisoners, ma'am

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:05.429
The King, his brother and yours,
abide all three distracted

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:13.476
but chiefly him that you term'd, ma'am
'The good old lord Gonzalo'...

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:19.317
His tears run down his beard, like
winter's drops from eaves of reeds

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.948
Your charm so strongly works 'em

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.070
that if you now beheld them

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:32.274
your affections would become tender

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:37.069
Dost thou think so, spirit?

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:40.030
Mine would, master

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.235
were l human

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.749
And mine shall

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.349
Hast thou, which art but air

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:57.991
a touch, a feeling of their afflictions
and shall not myself

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:03.154
one of their kind be kindlier
moved than thou art?

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:09.874
Though with their high wrongs
l am struck to th' quick

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:17.832
yet with my nobler reason
'gainst my fury do l take part

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.232
The rarer action is in virtue
than in vengeance

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.392
They being penitent

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:29.634
the sole drift of my purpose doth
extend not a frown further

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:33.031
Go, release them, Ariel

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.912
My charms l'll break

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:42.638
their senses l'll restore, and
they shall be themselves

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:45.757
l'll fetch them, ma'am

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:59.511
Ye elves of hills, brooks,
standing lakes and groves

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.670
and ye that on the sands
with printless foot

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:08.231
do chase the ebbing Neptune and do
fly him when he comes back

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:14.319
you demi-puppets that by moonshine
do the green sour ringlets make

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:17.438
whereof the ewe not bites

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.913
and you whose pastime is to make
midnight mushrooms

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.709
that rejoice to hear the solemn curfew

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:30.472
by whose aid
weak masters though ye be

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.949
l have bedimm'd the noontide sun

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.909
call'd forth the mutinous winds

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:58.671
and 'twixt the green sea
and the azured vault, set roaring war

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.832
to the dread rattling thunder
have l given fire

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.595
and rifted Jove's stout oak
with his own bolt

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:09.230
the strong-based promontory
have l made shake

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:13.279
and by the spurs pluck'd up
the pine and cedar

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.274
graves at my command have
waked their sleepers oped

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.749
and let 'em forth

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.754
by my so potent art

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:36.079
But this rough magic l here abjure

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:42.595
and, when l have required some
heavenly music which even now l do

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.470
to work mine end upon their senses
that this airy charm is for

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.795
l'll break my staff

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.516
bury it certain fathoms in the earth

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:03.079
and deeper than did
ever plummet sound

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.279
l'll drown my book

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.953
There stand, for you are spell-stopp'd

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.591
O good Gonzalo, my true preserver

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.479
and a loyal sir to him you follow'st

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.713
l will pay thy graces home
both in word and deed

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:17.196
Most cruelly didst thou, Alonso,
use me and my daughter

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.315
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.836
Thou art pinched for't now, Sebastian

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:32.669
Flesh and blood, you, brother mine

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.072
that entertain'd ambition, expell'd
remorse and nature

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:40.392
who, with Sebastian, would
here have killed your king

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:46.118
l do forgive thee, unnatural
though thou art

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.192
Their understanding begins to swell

01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:58.516
Ariel

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:03.631
fetch me the skirt and bodice from my
cell l will discase me, and myself present

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.110
as l was sometime Milan

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:11.194
Quickly, spirit! Thou shalt ere
long be free

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:29.072
O l shall miss thee Ariel

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.478
but yet thou shalt have freedom

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.759
so...

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.113
so...

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.913
so...

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:47.953
Behold the wronged Duchess
of Milan, Prospera

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.157
l bid a hearty welcome

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:01.394
Whe'r thou be'st she or no, or some
enchanted trifle to abuse me l not know

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.835
thy pulse beats as of flesh and blood

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.911
and, since l saw thee,
th' affliction of my mind amends

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.719
with which, l fear, a madness held me

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:19.956
This must crave and if this be at all
a most strange story

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:25.749
Thy dukedom l resign and do entreat
thou pardon me my wrongs

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.152
But how should Prospera
be living and be here?

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.828
First, noble friend

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.558
let me embrace thine age

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.829
whose honour cannot
be measured or confined

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.994
Whether this be or be not, l'll not swear

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.431
Welcome, my friends all

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.431
But you, my brace of lords

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.279
were l so minded l could here
pluck his Highness' frown upon you

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.954
and justify you traitors

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.309
at this time l will tell no tales

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.948
- The devil speaks in her
- No

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:19.719
For you, most wicked sir

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:24.559
whom to call brother would even
infect my mouth

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:31.477
l do forgive thy rankest fault, all of them

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:37.793
and require my dukedom of thee, which
perforce, l know thou must restore

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:42.159
lf thou beest Prospera, give us
particulars of thy preservation

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.834
How thou hast met us here

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.515
who three hours since were
wracked upon this shore

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:51.355
where l have lost my dear son
Ferdinand

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.558
l am woe for't, sir

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.672
for l have lost my daughter

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.278
A daughter?

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.512
When did you lose your daughter?

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.477
ln this last tempest

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:06.109
But, howsoe'er you have been
justled from your senses

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:09.590
know for certain that l am Prospera

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:18.352
Welcome, sir

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.913
This cell's my court

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.319
l pray you, look in

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.479
Sweet lord, you play me false

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.676
No, my dear'st love,
l would not for the world

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:34.638
Yes, for a score of kingdoms
you should wrangle

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.030
and l would call it, fair play

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.909
lf this prove a vision of the island,
one dear son shall l twice lose

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.799
Though the seas threaten,
they are merciful

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:46.077
l have cursed them without cause

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:49.471
Now all the blessings of a glad
father compass thee about!

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.791
Arise, and say how thou camest here

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.239
O, wonder!

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:03.279
How many goodly creatures are there
here! How beauteous mankind is!

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:07.433
O brave new world, that has
such people in't!

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.433
'Tis new to thee

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:12.072
What is this maid with whom
thou wast at play?

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:15.596
ls she the goddess that hath sever'd us
and brought us thus together?

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:20.117
Sir, she is mortal: but by
immortal providence she's mine

01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:22.789
l chose her when l could not ask
my father for his advice

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.316
nor thought l had one

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.917
Give me your hands

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:31.959
Be it so! Amen!

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.075
Was't well done?

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.873
Bravely, my diligence

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.829
Set Caliban and his confederates free

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.319
Untie the spell

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.516
Every man shift for all the rest

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.516
Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:24.718
lf these be true spies which l wear
in my head, then here's a goodly sight

01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:28.475
O Setebos, these be brave
spirits indeed!

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.354
How fine my master is!

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:33.831
l am afraid she will chastise me

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:39.271
What things are these, my lord
Antonio? Will money buy 'em?

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:43.638
Very like. One of them is a plain
fish, and no doubt marketable

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:48.749
These three have robb'd me, and
had plotted together to take my life

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:52.872
Two of these fellows
you must know and own

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.191
This thing of darkness
l acknowledge mine

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.828
l shall be pinched to death

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.913
ls not this Stephano,
my drunken butler?

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:09.629
And Trinculo is reeling ripe.
How camest thou in this pickle?

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.191
l have been in such a pickle
since l saw you last

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:16.830
that l fear me, it will never
out my bones

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.228
Why, how now, Stephano!

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:22.194
Touch me not! l am not Stephano,
but a cramp

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.478
You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.039
l should have been a sore one then

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:28.270
This is a strange thing as e'er l look'd on

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:32.430
What a thrice-double ass was l

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:36.878
to take this drunkard for a god
and worship this dull fool!

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.952
Go to! Away!

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.834
Hence, and bestow your luggage
where you found it

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.150
Or stole it, rather

01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.389
Sir, l invite your Highness and
your train to my poor cell

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.313
where you shall take your rest
for this one night, and in the morn

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.869
l'll bring you to your ship
and so to Naples

01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.034
where l have hope to see the nuptial
of these our dear-beloved solemnized

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.672
and thence retire me to my Milan

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:13.231
where every third thought
shall be my grave

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.798
My Ariel

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.151
Chick

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:28.233
That is thy charge
Then to the elements be free

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.154
Where the bee sucks there suck l

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.754
in a cowslip's bell l lie

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:42.708
there l couch when owl's do cry

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.791
on a bat's back l do fly

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:52.799
after summer, after summer merrily,
merrily, merrily... shall l live now

01:37:52.960 --> 01:38:01.117
under the blossom that hangs
on the bough

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:13.269
Now my charms are all o'erthrown

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:24.752
And what strength l have's mine own

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:33.435
Which is most faint

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:48.997
O, release me from by bands

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:56.316
With the help of your good hands

01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:00.268
Gentle breath

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:09.876
gentle breath of yours my sails must fill

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.592
Or else my project fails

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.836
Which was to please

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.797
Now, l want...

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.829
Spirits to enforce

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:54.629
Art to enchant

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.192
And my ending is despair

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:08.758
unless lbe relieved by prayer

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:15.476
Which pierces so that it assaults

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:21.192
pierces so that it assaults

01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:30.389
Mercy itself and frees all faults

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:43.597
As you from crimes would pardonned be

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:52.749
Let your indulgence...

01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:02.637
Let your indulgence...

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:11.356
... set me free

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.912
Now l want

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.593
Spirits to enforce

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:28.836
art to enchant

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:33.392
And my ending is despair

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:43.550
Unless l be relieved by prayer

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:19.791
Now l want

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:24.590
Spirits to enforce

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:31.032
art to enchant

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.999
and my ending is despair

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:45.519
Unless l be relieved by prayer

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:52.351
Which pierces so that it assaults

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:58.078
pierces so that it assaults

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:06.354
Mercy itself and frees all faults

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:16.433
As you from crimes

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:20.832
would pardon'd be

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:29.755
Let your indulgence

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:39.830
Let your indulgence

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:49.877
... set me free

01:44:50.305 --> 01:44:56.758
