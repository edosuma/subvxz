THIS IS MY CRACK STAFF?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.600
IT'S ALL I COULD FIND
ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.700
NOW, HURRY.

11:13.700 --> 11:14.600
THE FOOD CRITIC
IS OUR THERE

11:14.600 --> 11:16.567
AND HE'S EXPECTING
A 5-STAR MEAL.

11:16.567 --> 11:17.900
AND HE'LL GET IT,

11:17.900 --> 11:19.800
EVEN IF I HAVE TO WORK
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM

11:19.800 --> 11:22.133
UNTIL THEY'RE A QUIVERING
PUDDLE OF SWEAT.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.834
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING
INVITED TO A PARTY.

11:27.834 --> 11:30.800
YOU ARE.
NOW PUT YOUR PARTY HAT ON.

11:31.734 --> 11:35.700
OH, LOOK.
I'M A LAMP SHADE.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.667
OK, PEOPLE,
LET'S GET STARTED.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.600
MADDIE, CHOP ONIONS.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.567
AND IF YOU'RE NOT CRYING,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING.

11:42.567 --> 11:44.100
LONDON, BOIL SOME WATER.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.400
HOW DO I KNOW
WHEN IT'S BOILING?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.200
WHEN YOU PUT YOUR HAND IN
AND YELL "OW."

11:48.033 --> 11:50.367
CARRIE--

11:50.367 --> 11:51.867
OK, MOM.

11:51.867 --> 11:54.000
I'M GOING TO PLAY
TO YOUR STRENGTHS HERE.

11:54.000 --> 11:54.967
YOU WANT ME TO SING?

11:54.967 --> 11:56.000
YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF WASHING DISHES.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.033
CAN I SING
WHILE I'M WASHING?

11:57.033 --> 11:58.200
QUIETLY.
OK.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.900
WHAT DO I DO, CHIEF?

12:00.900 --> 12:03.000
STUFF THE CHICKEN
WITH VEGETABLES.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.100
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE
VEGETABLES?

12:04.100 --> 12:05.100
SHE'S DEAD.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.200
THAT'LL MAKE IT EASIER.

12:08.033 --> 12:09.867
THE CRITIC
WANTS TO ORDER.

12:09.867 --> 12:11.233
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

12:11.233 --> 12:12.400
WHAT SHOULD I DO?!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.600
WHAT SHOULD HE DO?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.800
WHAT SHOULD HE DO?!

12:17.900 --> 12:19.467
ASK HIM WHAT
HE WANTS TO EAT.

12:19.467 --> 12:20.934
AND MAKE SURE
IT'S THE CHICKEN PAOLO.

12:20.934 --> 12:22.400
THAT'S MY BEST DISH.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.567
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
BRING IT IN.

12:27.567 --> 12:28.700
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.100
DO JUST AS I SAY.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.100
WE NEED TO BE
A WELL-OILED MACHINE.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.133
[ALL TOGETHER]
YES, SIR!

12:33.133 --> 12:34.300
AND BREAK!

12:37.000 --> 12:38.567
HOT, HOT, HOT!

12:42.033 --> 12:43.233
HELLO, AGAIN.

12:43.233 --> 12:45.000
OR SHOULD I SAY
HOWDY?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.500
MAY I RECOMMEND
THE CHICKEN PAOLO?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.567
THANKS. I'LL HAVE
THE SEAFOOD MEDLEY.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.700
GOOD.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.367
EXCELLENT CHOICE.

12:53.367 --> 12:56.734
ALTHOUGH NOT AS GOOD AS
THE CHICKEN PAOLO--

12:56.734 --> 13:01.200
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
IS THE SPECIALTY OF
OUR CHEF PAOLO.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.033
THAT'S JUST FASCINATING.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.367
BUT I HAD CHICKEN
FOR LUNCH.

13:09.233 --> 13:10.800
BUT NOT THE CHICKEN PAOLO!

13:11.600 --> 13:14.033
WHICH IS SO DELICIOUS,

13:14.033 --> 13:15.600
CHICKENS ARE
LINING UP AT THE DOOR

13:15.600 --> 13:18.100
JUST TO BE MADE
INTO IT.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.867
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
EAT IT?

13:19.867 --> 13:23.367
AND BRING ME
MY DANG SEAFOOD MEDLEY.

13:23.367 --> 13:26.367
ONE DANG SEAFOOD MEDLEY
COMING UP.

13:26.367 --> 13:28.600
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.834
NEEDS SALT.

13:36.767 --> 13:38.800
NEEDS PEPPER.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.934
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

13:44.934 --> 13:46.000
IT'S DISHWATER.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.200
NEEDS SOAP.

13:48.133 --> 13:51.033
EW, EW...
THIS IS SO GROSS.

13:51.033 --> 13:52.900
AND IT'S TAKING FOREVER.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.000
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE CUTTING WITH
A SPOON.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.300
MOSEBY WON'T
LET ME USE KNIVES.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.400
DON'T ASK.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.834
THE CRITIC INSISTS
ON THE SEAFOOD MEDLEY.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.300
OH!
OH!
OH!
NO.

14:06.300 --> 14:07.300
YES.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.300
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,

14:08.300 --> 14:09.867
DROP WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

14:11.734 --> 14:14.300
MAMA MIA--
I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LITERALLY.

14:14.300 --> 14:17.033
CHEF PAOLO WOULD NEVER
STAND FOR THIS.

14:17.033 --> 14:18.934
CHEF PAOLO
ISN'T HERE.

14:18.934 --> 14:21.467
TRUE. BUT HE SAID
I'M JUST LIKE HIM...

14:21.467 --> 14:22.600
EXCEPT NOT AS GOOD-LOOKING,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.967
WHICH, FRANKLY, I DON'T GET.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.000
ALL RIGHT, SEAFOOD MEDLEY.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.300
ZACK, GET ME TWO LOBSTERS.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.233
I'LL GO GET
MY BATHING SUIT.

14:32.233 --> 14:34.200
JUST REACH IN
AND GRAB THEM.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.767
AH, THAT'S NO FUN.

14:36.767 --> 14:40.800
LONDON, PEEL AND DE-VAIN
THE SHRIMP.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.300
RIGHT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:42.300 --> 14:46.600
LONDON, TELL MADDIE
TO PEEL AND DE-VAIN
THE SHRIMP.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.000
PATRICK...

14:49.000 --> 14:50.233
WE NEED TO STALL
FOR TIME.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.834
TAKE THE SALAD CART OUT,
AND MAKE THE CRITIC
A SALAD.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.233
I CAN'T.
WHY NOT?

14:53.233 --> 14:54.934
HE SCARES ME.

14:54.934 --> 14:57.000
BESIDES, GARRY AND RICHARD
ARE THE ONLY WAITERS

14:57.000 --> 14:58.400
WHO CAN DO
TABLE-SIDE SERVICE.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.567
LONDON!

15:00.567 --> 15:02.000
GET GARRY AND GET RICH.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.600
I'M ALREADY RICH.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.200
JUST GET THE WAITERS!

15:06.200 --> 15:07.367
OH!

15:12.667 --> 15:14.367
SORRY, RICH.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.100
GUESS YOU BETTER
GET GARRY.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.567
I'LL DO IT.

15:18.567 --> 15:19.667
THAT WAS THE IN DOOR.

15:19.667 --> 15:22.300
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THE OUT DOOR LIKE THIS.

15:28.467 --> 15:30.033
I'M GUESSING THAT WAS GARY.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.500
YES! AND RIGHT NOW
I AM JEALOUS
OF BOTH OF THEM.

15:40.367 --> 15:43.000
CAN'T YOU PEOPLE
DO ANYTHING RIGHT?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.600
MADDIE, LONDON,
GET OUT THERE
AND TOSS THE SALAD.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.200
AT WHO?

15:47.200 --> 15:48.767
OH, COME ON.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.300
SQUINGILI!

15:50.300 --> 15:51.967
WHAT ELSE CAN GO WRONG?

15:51.967 --> 15:53.033
[CRUNCH]

15:58.133 --> 16:00.834
I ASKED YOU
FOR TWO LOBSTERS.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.000
HAPPY?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.934
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

16:10.934 --> 16:12.467
YOUR MEAL
IS ON ITS WAY.

16:12.467 --> 16:14.600
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR ORDERING EXTRA CHEESE.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.567
WHAA!

16:19.400 --> 16:22.133
PLEASE FORGIVE
MY GIRLISH SHRIEK.

16:22.133 --> 16:23.767

16:23.767 --> 16:26.467
WE'RE MAKING THE FAMOUS
TIPTON SPINNING SALAD BOWL

16:26.467 --> 16:28.600
AS WE HAVE DONE
A THOUSAND TIMES BEFORE.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.600

16:29.600 --> 16:31.200

16:33.834 --> 16:35.934
OHH...

16:35.934 --> 16:38.667
YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT.
IT'S SO GOOD.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.000
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.700
BON APPETIT.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.100
WELL,
THAT WAS A DISASTER.

17:17.100 --> 17:20.033
GREAT.
MORE INCOMPETENCE.

17:20.033 --> 17:21.500
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

17:21.500 --> 17:23.600
WHERE'S ZACK

17:23.600 --> 17:26.467
AAH!

17:32.100 --> 17:35.133
THANK GOODNESS IT DIDN'T

17:53.400 --> 17:55.734
PEOPLE!

17:55.734 --> 17:57.567
GET BACK TO YOUR POSTS!

17:57.567 --> 18:00.066
I'M NOT PAYING YOU
TO STAND AROUND.

18:00.066 --> 18:01.767
YOU'RE NOT
PAYING US AT ALL.

18:01.767 --> 18:03.467
I'M TURNING IN
MY SPATULA.

18:03.467 --> 18:04.800
THAT'S A LADLE.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.400
OH, YEAH?
WELL, LET SEE IF
YOU RECOGNIZE THIS.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.834
IT'S ME LEAVING.

18:09.834 --> 18:11.300
RIGHT.
AND THIS IS ME...

18:11.300 --> 18:12.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.300
LEAVING.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.300
LEAVING.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.967
DITTO.

18:15.967 --> 18:17.200
FINE.
I DON'T NEED THEM.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.300
I AM CHEF PAOLO.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.800
I MEAN CHEF CODY.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.400
UH, CHEF CODY--
YOUR FOOD IS ON FIRE.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.133
NOT MY BABY!

18:27.133 --> 18:28.300
NO!

18:34.233 --> 18:37.133
MY POOR SEAFOOD MEDLEY.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.200
IT'S SEAFOOD DEADLY, NOW.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.133
WHO NEEDS 5 STARS?

18:43.133 --> 18:45.567
WE'LL JUST BECOME
A TRUCK STOP.

18:45.567 --> 18:48.400
I HEAR THAT TRUCKERS
ARE LOVELY PEOPLE,

18:48.400 --> 18:50.233
AND GENEROUS TIPPERS.

18:51.300 --> 18:54.767
I REALLY WANTED
THOSE STARS!

18:54.767 --> 18:57.400
ME, TOO.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.500
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE MISTREATED

18:58.500 --> 18:59.934
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE
TRYING TO HELP YOU.

18:59.934 --> 19:02.500
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE LIKE CHEF PAOLO.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.500
HOW'S THAT
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

19:05.667 --> 19:07.300
NOT GREAT.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.367
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE GOOD AT SOMETHING

19:08.367 --> 19:09.767
DOESN'T GIVE YOU
THE RIGHT TO BE MEAN.

19:09.767 --> 19:12.900
OK. I GUESS I WAS
SORT OF A JERK.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.367
SORT OF?
TRY BIG JERK.

19:14.367 --> 19:15.500
GIANT JERK.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.000
PICTURE THE BIGGEST JERK
IN THE WORLD,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.934
AND YOU'RE BIGGER
THAN HIM.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.800
I DON'T WANT
TO ALARM YOU,

19:22.800 --> 19:25.900
BUT THE CRITIC JUST
SENT OUT FOR A PIZZA.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.467
I'M RUINED!

19:27.467 --> 19:30.233
OK, EVERYBODY,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

19:30.233 --> 19:31.233
WILL YOU ALL
PLEASE HELP ME

19:31.233 --> 19:33.133

COMING UP!

19:46.500 --> 19:48.033
WHOA!

19:48.033 --> 19:50.300
YOUR SEAFOOD MEDLEY
JUST SWAM IN.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.100
WELL,
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.233
I'M SO HUNGRY
I COULD EAT A HORSE.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.700
MMM-MMM-MMM!

20:01.700 --> 20:04.600
THERE'S A HOEDOWN
IN MY MOUTH.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.667
YEE-HAW!

20:06.667 --> 20:08.767
EXCUSE ME.
I'M STARVING.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.100
COULD I HAVE
A LITTLE TASTE OF THAT?

20:10.100 --> 20:11.300
HEY! HEY!

20:12.300 --> 20:13.834
ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE US
A GOOD REVIEW?

20:13.834 --> 20:15.800
I'LL TELL
ALL THE FOLKS I KNOW,

20:15.800 --> 20:16.900
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

20:16.900 --> 20:20.000
WAIT A MINUTE.
AREN'T YOU THE CRITIC?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.767
ACTUALLY,
I'M THE CRITIC.

20:21.767 --> 20:23.667
AND I'M GOING
TO GIVE THIS PLACE
SUCH A BAD REVIEW,

20:23.667 --> 20:25.900
PEOPLE WILL PAY
NOT TO EAT HERE.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.467
OH, PLEASE,
MR. BéARNAISE.

20:27.467 --> 20:31.467
THE TRUTH IS
OUR CHEF AND HIS STAFF QUIT,

20:31.467 --> 20:33.400
SO EVERYONE PITCHED IN
TO TRY AND MAKE YOU--

20:33.400 --> 20:34.500
WELL, ACTUALLY IT WAS HIM,

20:34.500 --> 20:35.934
BUT IT
SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOU--

20:35.934 --> 20:37.200
A GREAT MEAL.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.400
PLEASE, MR. CRITIC,

20:38.400 --> 20:40.400
WE ALL DID THE BEST
THAT WE COULD.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.867
DON'T CARE.
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS THE FOOD.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.967
SINCE I DIDN'T GET ANY,
I'D SAY--

20:46.500 --> 20:49.300
HOLY MACKEREL,
THAT'S YUMMY.

20:51.367 --> 20:52.400
ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE US
A GOOD REVIEW?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.600
AFTER THIS
TERRIBLE SERVICE?
NO.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.967
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

20:55.967 --> 20:57.734
NO MATTER WHAT
DADDY SAYS.

21:00.567 --> 21:02.500
BUT I AM GOING
TO GIVE YOU
ANOTHER CHANCE.

21:02.500 --> 21:06.100
OH, THANK--SO--

21:11.200 --> 21:13.500
AND WE GUARANTEE YOU
A PERFECT MEAL.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.800
BETTER MAKE SURE
THEY'RE ALL PERFECT,

21:14.800 --> 21:16.934
BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO RECOGNIZE ME.

21:16.934 --> 21:20.667
BUT YOU'RE NOT WEARING
A DISGUISE RIGHT NOW.

21:20.667 --> 21:22.734
[WOMAN'S VOICE]
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.
