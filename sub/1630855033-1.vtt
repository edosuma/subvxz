Of course men do that, okay?

09:03.353 --> 09:06.891
We're not even divorced,
and I see some of your friends
giving me the look.

09:07.390 --> 09:09.492
-What look?
-You know, the,

09:09.559 --> 09:12.029
"I've been stuck
in the desert and I just saw

09:12.096 --> 09:14.165
a chilled beer" look.

09:14.564 --> 09:16.700
-Thirsty.
-They may look,

09:16.767 --> 09:19.369
but my boys aren't gonna
reach out if you and I break up.

09:19.436 --> 09:21.705
You don't date your friend's ex.

09:22.073 --> 09:23.174
That's bro code, bro.

09:23.573 --> 09:26.978
Imagine if word got out
that we were separating.

09:27.611 --> 09:31.348
I wonder which one of my friends
would reach out to you first.

09:31.414 --> 09:33.550
[light suspenseful music]

09:33.617 --> 09:38.588
-Have no clue.
-What if we pretended
to get separated?

09:38.923 --> 09:42.994
-Divorce bait everyone,
see who hits you up first.
-[chuckles]

09:43.060 --> 09:45.328
[claps] That is a terrible idea.

09:45.395 --> 09:48.232
Babe, you know how hard it is
to cover up a lie.

09:48.565 --> 09:51.601
I mean,
shit gets freaking crazy.

09:51.668 --> 09:53.470
-And how do you know?
-My ex.

09:53.536 --> 09:55.772
She was so stressed
about the affair

09:55.840 --> 09:58.775
that she was having
during our marriage,

09:59.442 --> 10:00.845
-she got a white pube.
-Ew.

10:00.912 --> 10:01.979
How the hell do you kno. .

10:02.379 --> 10:04.748
You know what?
I don't even wanna know.

10:07.952 --> 10:10.054
Oh my God, babe. There's Greg.

10:10.387 --> 10:11.621
Don't look!

10:12.223 --> 10:14.825
Oh, he's so sad and lonely.

10:14.892 --> 10:17.895
-We should invite him
to join us.
-No, Alexis!

10:18.262 --> 10:20.697
Just leave him alone,
it'll be awkward.

10:21.232 --> 10:22.532
Divorce is rough, babe.

10:22.599 --> 10:25.368
He's our friend.
We need to support him.

10:26.703 --> 10:29.840
Oh, hey, babe.
The whole town is here.

10:29.907 --> 10:32.542
It's Tina, <i>La Cochina. </i>

10:32.944 --> 10:35.745
[gasps] This motherfucker!

10:35.812 --> 10:38.581
-Oh, wow.
-The body's not even cold yet.

10:38.648 --> 10:40.417
Alexis, just leave it alone.

10:40.483 --> 10:42.153
-I'm gonna go over there.
-No, you're not.

10:42.219 --> 10:43.420
You're gonna sit down,
you're gonna enjoy

10:43.486 --> 10:44.788
this amazing salad.

10:44.855 --> 10:46.656
[tense music]

10:47.024 --> 10:49.927
- . sexy.
-Thank you.
I like your scent, too,

10:49.994 --> 10:51.328
-what is it?
-It's, uh, soap.

10:51.761 --> 10:53.797
Fuck that.
I want to see what's going on.

10:53.864 --> 10:55.266
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

10:55.332 --> 10:57.134
-No.
-He needs my support, okay?

10:57.500 --> 10:59.569
Maybe he's okay. Maybe he's not.

10:59.636 --> 11:02.006
-You don't know.
-He's fine, babe, sit down.

11:02.073 --> 11:03.440
Babe, sit. .

11:03.840 --> 11:05.209
[chuckles]

11:05.276 --> 11:08.045
[laughs] Hey, guys!
How's it going?

11:08.112 --> 11:10.347
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

11:10.413 --> 11:12.183
Greg, how's Julia?

11:12.249 --> 11:14.051
I don't know if you've heard. .

11:14.118 --> 11:15.987
Oh, I've heard.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.289

11:18.355 --> 11:20.390
Thanks. I got it

11:20.457 --> 11:22.059
Where're your five kids?
[chuckles]

11:22.126 --> 11:23.693
At their five babies' daddies?

11:23.760 --> 11:26.163
I have three,
and they're at home with my mom.

11:26.230 --> 11:28.165
-Oh. Yeah.
-She must be a saint.

11:28.698 --> 11:31.135
So what are we doing here?

11:31.202 --> 11:34.939
-Well, we'r. . hanging out.
-We're just hanging out.
[chuckles]

11:35.006 --> 11:37.874

[Marco]
Well, Tina,

-Thank you. [chuckles]

11:47.918 --> 11:48.885
[groans]

11:49.486 --> 11:52.990
Hey, Greg,
Julia, is she all right?

11:53.490 --> 11:55.658
-Hell, man, are you all right?
-Yeah.

11:55.926 --> 11:58.262
We're getting through it,
but, um. .

11:58.329 --> 11:59.529
[clicks tongue] it's hard.

11:59.997 --> 12:01.531

-Okay.
-Wow.

12:19.482 --> 12:21.285
Alexis, what the hell?

12:21.352 --> 12:24.554
You can't just go over
to someone and just boom,
go right into them.

12:24.621 --> 12:26.489
[chuckling]
They're hanging out? Okay,

12:26.556 --> 12:28.359

fucking these days?

12:28.425 --> 12:30.627
[laughs] They're fucking.
They've got the look.

12:30.693 --> 12:32.796
Alexis,
it's none of your business.

12:33.097 --> 12:35.498
They're adults, they can do
whatever the hell they want!

12:35.565 --> 12:38.035
Shit's not right. What the hell?

13:05.495 --> 13:06.930
Absolutely.

13:08.832 --> 13:11.135
Think we'll
still enjoy lovemaking?

I'm sorry I was tripping, babe.

13:29.986 --> 13:31.554

Before you hear
from anyone else, all right,

How about you guys?
Are you just kind of
hanging out? [laughs]

15:18.229 --> 15:19.963
He's my brother.

What the heck is going on?

15:27.238 --> 15:29.573
[whispering] Alexis,
it's not what it looks like.

15:29.906 --> 15:34.644
We're just. . helping each other
get through a rough patch.

If you're steps, it's okay.

15:49.460 --> 15:51.828
-[panting]
-Alexis, please stop.

15:51.894 --> 15:54.030
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
I don't wanna be running

15:54.097 --> 15:56.233
with hot coffee spilling
all over me.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.868
Baby, what has gotten into you?

15:58.935 --> 16:02.172
It's none of our business.
These are adults.

16:02.239 --> 16:03.407
They are our friends.

16:03.474 --> 16:04.641
I don't know what's going on,

16:04.707 --> 16:06.343
but I can't trust these bitches.

16:06.410 --> 16:09.613
They all wanna hang out.
They probably wanna
hang out with you.

16:09.679 --> 16:10.880
-Of course.
-Mm-hmm.

16:10.947 --> 16:12.882
Because I'm
fucking irresistible.

Alexis, come on! [sighs]

16:21.791 --> 16:23.826
[Marco]
Baby, just let it go.

16:23.893 --> 16:26.397
You can't show up
to a parent-teacher conference

16:26.463 --> 16:30.033
all pissed off about something
that we have no control over.

16:30.099 --> 16:32.969
I mean, you're liable to stab
the teacher with a pencil

16:33.036 --> 16:35.439
if she gives us
a bad report about Emma.

16:35.972 --> 16:38.542
All right?
Just relax. It's okay.

16:38.975 --> 16:40.311
Come on,

16:51.322 --> 16:52.423
What did you do?

16:53.223 --> 16:54.791
What did you do?

16:54.857 --> 16:56.660
I'm gonna test
these people, okay?

-I can't trust these hoes,
all right?
-[phone chimes]

17:22.386 --> 17:23.786

17:23.853 --> 17:25.154
-Let me see who's. .
-Just. . no!

17:25.221 --> 17:26.856
Baby, we're gonna get
in an accident.

17:26.923 --> 17:29.660
-How?
-You're acting crazy here.

17:29.959 --> 17:32.762
No, I'm gonna divorce bait
these bitches, okay?

17:32.829 --> 17:34.398
I am not losing another man

17:34.465 --> 17:37.133

no two hands are the same,

26:35.437 --> 26:37.140
no two mans are the same.

26:37.807 --> 26:39.943
Marco is not
your cheating ex-husband,

26:40.010 --> 26:42.544
and you could really screw
this up if you don't trust him.

26:58.962 --> 27:02.032
The manicurist burned his hands.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.767
-Second-degree burns.
-Oh, shit.

27:04.834 --> 27:07.070
Those bi-racial hands
are his bread and butter.

27:07.137 --> 27:09.839
-I know.
-That ought to set him back.

27:09.906 --> 27:11.975
Well, they'll just give the job
to someone else,

27:12.042 --> 27:13.977
but financially, he's set.

27:14.044 --> 27:15.245
He has insurance on those hands

27:15.311 --> 27:18.081
and the best doctors
working on them.

27:19.381 --> 27:21.383
You can insure your body parts?

27:21.684 --> 27:22.751
Yep.

27:23.352 --> 27:25.889
Should I insure my dick?

27:26.655 --> 27:29.625
Why would you insure your dick?

27:29.692 --> 27:33.163
I don't know. As crazy
as you've been acting recently,

27:33.229 --> 27:35.165

28:27.117 --> 28:31.154
Well, first of all,
I just want to say thank you
for reaching out, Tracey.

28:31.221 --> 28:34.623
It's, um, good to know
that we have friends
that we can count on.

28:34.690 --> 28:37.160
Oh, yeah, of course. Absolutely.

28:37.526 --> 28:38.494
So what happened?

28:38.560 --> 28:41.663
You know, basic couple shit.

28:41.730 --> 28:43.899
You know, I left
the cap off the toothpaste,

28:43.967 --> 28:46.369
she left her, um,
hair in the drain.

28:46.435 --> 28:49.505
Oh, come on.
You can be honest with me.

28:49.571 --> 28:50.940
Was she a horrible housewife?

28:51.307 --> 28:53.309

The house was always a mess.

29:03.619 --> 29:06.056
-Yeah. Yeah.
-What else?

29:06.122 --> 29:08.391
-She could be
quite controlling, you know.
-[softly] Oh.

29:08.457 --> 29:11.027
Everything had to be
right in the calendar.

29:11.094 --> 29:13.929

29:13.997 --> 29:15.431
Oops. Oh my goodness,

29:15.497 --> 29:17.400
I'm so clumsy.

Don't fall for it, Marco.
Don't fall for it.

29:22.871 --> 29:24.040
Yeah. Oh.

29:24.107 --> 29:25.674

I mean, it's been three years
since the divorce?

-Mm-hmm.
-How's the dating scene?

30:34.810 --> 30:38.714
[sighs] It's pretty bleak,
if I'm honest.

30:38.780 --> 30:43.286
You know? It's hard
to find a man, a good man,

35:41.484 --> 35:45.521
And, um, should I wear
my bathing suit
or can I change there?

35:45.588 --> 35:47.423
[laughing] Bathing suit!

35:47.490 --> 35:49.291
You're so hilarious!

35:49.659 --> 35:52.060
[light romantic music]

35:53.529 --> 35:55.330
Okay, uh, bye, Miss Beach.

35:55.398 --> 35:57.533
[Miss Beach]
I'll text you the address.

35:57.600 --> 36:01.837
-[horn honking]
-Imagine being pampered
like this all the time.

36:01.903 --> 36:04.339
Oh my God,
I missed this for sure.

36:04.707 --> 36:07.142
I'm happy to hear it. But. .

36:08.143 --> 36:09.512
are you ready to see Samuel?

36:09.579 --> 36:12.848
What? Okay, there is
nothing there, I promise.

36:12.914 --> 36:15.851
Honey, you and him had
some crazy chemistry.

36:15.917 --> 36:17.420
And that's dangerous.

36:17.487 --> 36:20.656
Okay, Samuel and I were hot
for each other, but toxic.

36:20.723 --> 36:22.224
We were always
at each other's throats.

36:22.525 --> 36:24.627
And the only reason
we lasted that long

36:24.694 --> 36:26.194
was because of the make-up sex.

36:26.261 --> 36:28.631
Well, just make sure
those embers are gone.

36:28.698 --> 36:33.168
-We want you going back to work,
not back to being single.
-[chuckles]

36:33.969 --> 36:35.303
[deeply inhales and exhales]

36:39.941 --> 36:41.410
[both laugh]

36:41.477 --> 36:43.679
What the. . okay.

36:44.279 --> 36:46.549
Don't worry about her.
She's pissed

36:46.616 --> 36:48.417
because she wanted this job.

36:48.950 --> 36:50.419
You watch your back around her.

36:51.086 --> 36:55.090
Oh, I'm so nervous,
I didn't even get a chance
to eat today, I'm starving.

36:55.156 --> 36:57.793
[grunts] Well, grab a snack
and knock them dead.

36:57.860 --> 36:59.127
I'll see you
on the flip side, baby.

36:59.194 --> 37:01.731
I've got an appointment
for some TLC

37:01.797 --> 37:03.965
with Kim and Kanye.

37:04.032 --> 37:07.335
[chuckling] Okay.
Thank you so much.

Hi, I missed you! [chuckles]

37:22.317 --> 37:24.587

Oh, fuck yeah. Come here.

37:24.654 --> 37:26.187
[mumbling]

37:26.254 --> 37:30.425
Oh, that's. . never mind, enjoy.

37:31.993 --> 37:34.996
[softly] I hate her,
with her big titties.

37:38.568 --> 37:39.735
[softly] Mm!

37:40.101 --> 37:42.437

-No, again!

38:18.974 --> 38:20.241
Okay, Samuel, great.

38:20.308 --> 38:22.177
You can't kiss me
on the mouth anymore.

38:22.243 --> 38:25.046
-I'm a married woman.
-Oh, that is a nice rock.

38:32.521 --> 38:33.789
What? Still feisty.

38:33.856 --> 38:36.959
-Oh, you know me. Always.
-She's so feisty. I like it.

38:37.025 --> 38:39.094
-Yeah. Mm.
-No. I. . I missed that.

38:39.461 --> 38:41.429
Actually, I haven't missed much.
I've been keeping up with you

38:41.496 --> 38:43.098
-on social media. Yeah!
-Really?

38:43.164 --> 38:45.166
Because I don't know
anything about you.

38:45.233 --> 38:47.002
Other than you're
still not married.

38:47.068 --> 38:48.436
Oh, burn.

38:48.838 --> 38:51.874
[sighs] Well, honey,
you've ruined me for all women.

38:51.941 --> 38:55.143
That's because I'm like a dog
on a fire hydrant, just. .

38:55.210 --> 38:58.814
-[mimics pissing]
just pissing all over you.
-[sighs]

38:59.414 --> 39:01.550
[softly] Thank you

39:01.617 --> 39:03.385
-Okay, let's get started. Yeah?
-Yeah.

39:03.451 --> 39:04.654
Jasmine is gonna
be helping us out.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.656
Oh, I think she's helped enough.

39:07.556 --> 39:09.257
-Okay. Alexis, take a seat.
-[Jasmine] Yeah.

39:09.324 --> 39:10.626
Uh, Jasmine, will you place

39:10.693 --> 39:12.460
a few of those gummies
in her palm for me?

39:12.527 --> 39:15.731
Okay, Alexis, open up.
Place them right there.

39:15.798 --> 39:17.298
Beautiful. Beau. .

-Okay, Jasmin. .

39:19.869 --> 39:21.804
-What happened?
-Jasmine, the whol. .
the whole point,

39:21.871 --> 39:23.271
Jasmine,
is to place them in her palm,

39:23.338 --> 39:25.540
make sure they stay, okay?
Let's try that.

39:25.608 --> 39:28.176
Okay, let's do it again.
Let's go. Okay.

39:28.243 --> 39:30.311
-There you go.
All right, here we go.
-Mm-hmm.

39:30.378 --> 39:33.181
-Um.
-Give me hot. Roll the tips.

39:33.248 --> 39:35.483
-[camera clicking]

39:35.550 --> 39:37.887
Now, open it up.
Open it up, open it up!

Yes. [grunts]
Give me a hyena. [growls]

-Oh, yeah.
-[mimics hyena]
Those fingertips are so sexy.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.996
God, look at that.
So, Diva tells me

39:47.062 --> 39:50.231
that this is your first hand job
in eight years.

39:50.298 --> 39:53.636
[laughs] Hand job?
Oh, you're so funny.

39:53.703 --> 39:55.303
I get it. Uh, no, actually,

39:55.370 --> 39:57.673
I haven't given
a hand job since I was 17.

39:57.740 --> 40:00.042
Well, looks like
we'll have to change that.

40:00.108 --> 40:01.610
I'm just kidding,
I. . I'm kidding.

40:01.677 --> 40:03.344
Okay, you know what?
let's go to the chocolates.

40:03.411 --> 40:05.146
Let's place one
on the index finger,

40:05.213 --> 40:07.449
on the tip, okay?

40:08.216 --> 40:11.086
Gently place it there,
Jasmine. Thank you.

40:11.152 --> 40:12.587
-Okay, Alexis.
-[Jasmine] Hold still.

40:12.655 --> 40:15.390

Hold it there. Okay. Come on.

-Wait, wait, wait. What?

41:00.736 --> 41:03.773
-Did you eat the edibles?
-[mimicking] "Did you eat
the edibles?"

41:03.839 --> 41:05.406
She gave them to me.

Oh my God, look at your titties.

You made it!

41:58.293 --> 42:01.096
Oh, and you brought
a bag of tricks.

42:01.163 --> 42:02.798
Some people
usually wait a few times

42:02.865 --> 42:04.299
before they dive right in.

42:04.365 --> 42:06.434
But you're just getting
all in there, aren't you?

42:06.501 --> 42:08.303
-[laughs]
-Yeah, I'm a good swimmer.

42:08.369 --> 42:09.839
Look, I don't mean to brag,

42:09.905 --> 42:12.674

for four years.

42:12.741 --> 42:14.542
-What's up, buddy? [laughs]
-[groans] Oh, God!

Oh, man,
I knew you'd come around.

-Hey, Marco.
-Okay.

42:23.085 --> 42:26.055
We've been coming
to these pool parties
for some time now.

42:26.121 --> 42:30.192
Really? And you never thought
of inviting Alexis and me?

42:30.258 --> 42:31.626
[all laugh]

42:31.994 --> 42:35.430
-Who doesn't love
a good pool party, right?

42:54.249 --> 42:56.618
-Marquito!
-Ah, Jesus.

42:57.452 --> 42:59.121
You were invited?

42:59.188 --> 43:00.588
-Sheesh.
-[chuckles]

43:00.655 --> 43:01.991
Technically, no.

43:02.057 --> 43:03.893
I saw your text from Miss Beach,

43:03.959 --> 43:05.060
so I'm crashing.

43:05.127 --> 43:06.527
But I knew
you'd need a sidekick.

43:06.594 --> 43:08.329
You saw my text? That's. .

43:08.396 --> 43:11.901
Oh, and I'm gonna need a ride.
I took the bus.

43:12.634 --> 43:14.636
You took the bus
wearing water shoes?

43:14.970 --> 43:17.605
It's for the environment, bro.
Don't judge.

43:19.340 --> 43:21.844
Hey, hey. I'm really glad

43:21.911 --> 43:24.113
-that you're here.
-Why isn't anyone in the pool?

43:24.179 --> 43:25.546
That's what I mean.

43:26.081 --> 43:29.051
Something's up. I, I, I just
can't put my finger on it.

43:29.118 --> 43:34.422
But the fact that they never
invited Alexis and me
to one of these parties. .

43:34.722 --> 43:36.324
[Frank]
Can I have your attention,
everybody?

43:36.391 --> 43:38.559
[Tanya]
I'd like to welcome everyone.

43:38.626 --> 43:41.396
As always, we will go
over the short rules.

43:41.462 --> 43:43.598
I'm glad they're reminding
everyone not to run.

43:43.665 --> 43:45.300
I fell on my head so hard once,

43:45.366 --> 43:47.269
I forgot how to wipe
my own ass for a week.

43:47.335 --> 43:49.171
The safe word is "papaya. "

43:49.238 --> 43:51.739

of Guns N' Roses.

43:51.806 --> 43:53.341
-[Marco] No way.
-[Bob] Yeah, bro.

43:53.408 --> 43:54.709
I didn't know
he was in the bingo.

43:54.776 --> 43:56.145
[Tanya]
. and unfortunately you can't

43:56.211 --> 43:58.147
-come back ever again.

Number one draft pick.

44:10.358 --> 44:12.827
University of awesome, bro.

44:12.895 --> 44:14.696
These people
are so fucking organized.

44:14.762 --> 44:16.664
All of this
just to get in the pool?

44:16.731 --> 44:19.400
I swear I'm gonna cannonball
on these fools when I get in.

44:19.467 --> 44:22.437
-I'm with you.
-I have an 18 and a 3.

See you in the pool, bro.

44:40.621 --> 44:41.991
[Marco]
Whoo-hoo!

Hey, 30.

Hey, you are
in the bomb pop room.

44:49.932 --> 44:51.066

You have small wrists.
I like that.

Maybe we can use it
to our advantage.

That was the most demure
throw-up I've ever seen
in my life.

50:36.478 --> 50:38.680
And then you just drove off
like nothing happened.

50:38.746 --> 50:40.047
I didn't even notice
until I got home

50:40.114 --> 50:41.849
there was puke
all on the side of my car.

50:41.916 --> 50:43.352
I know. I'm so sorry.

50:43.418 --> 50:47.121
I was such an idiot.
I think we just began dating.

50:47.722 --> 50:48.923
It took me a while to get you

50:48.989 --> 50:51.726
to let your walls down
and just be you.

50:52.461 --> 50:53.362
Puke and all.

50:53.428 --> 50:54.962
But you did.

you're the last person

51:16.651 --> 51:18.085
We got what we needed anyway.

51:18.152 --> 51:19.721
All I cared about was the fact

51:19.787 --> 51:22.491
that you looked happy
and that you loosened up.

51:22.890 --> 51:24.892
It reminded me of old times.

That was a big mistake.

56:17.986 --> 56:20.689
like, "You know what?
Fuck Marco.

56:20.755 --> 56:22.189
I'm gonna blow all his friends

56:22.256 --> 56:24.058
because I'm
an independent woman. "

56:24.124 --> 56:26.027
What? That's. .

56:26.093 --> 56:27.862
She kissed him.

56:28.262 --> 56:29.698
Why would she be mad?

56:30.130 --> 56:33.968
Guys, guys.
What's with the questions?

56:34.268 --> 56:36.370
We're just trying to figure out

56:36.437 --> 56:39.674
if it's a good time
to ask her out now

56:39.741 --> 56:40.875
or just wait a little bit.

56:40.942 --> 56:42.342
You're cool with now?

56:42.811 --> 56:44.244
Are you fucking kidding me?

56:44.311 --> 56:46.313
-God!
-You two are supposed to be

56:46.380 --> 56:47.481

[Estanley]
You know what? The way I see it,

56:59.928 --> 57:01.930
you must remember this.

57:02.296 --> 57:03.965
A kiss is just a kiss.

57:04.364 --> 57:07.635
A fly is just a fly. It. .

57:07.936 --> 57:10.705
Ah, fuck. How, how does it go?

57:10.772 --> 57:12.006
The fuck are you saying?

57:12.406 --> 57:16.845
Well, what I'm saying is
once you love her screw,

57:17.277 --> 57:19.446
they still say "I love you. "

57:19.814 --> 57:21.683
And that's the shit, man.

57:21.750 --> 57:23.617
That's totally the shit.

57:23.952 --> 57:25.687
That's the shit.

57:25.987 --> 57:29.423
I love her. I love her.

[Estanley]
He's passed out.

57:34.763 --> 57:38.632
-Let's sharpie his face
and his balls.
-Yeah.

57:38.700 --> 57:41.201

the sharpie?

57:41.268 --> 57:42.202

58:13.835 --> 58:15.435
Coffee like you like it.

58:17.005 --> 58:18.539
How did you know I was here?

58:19.206 --> 58:21.876
Estanley ordered pizza
from our pizza account.

58:21.943 --> 58:22.977
[laughs]

58:23.044 --> 58:25.079
Babe, I'm really sorry.

58:26.080 --> 58:29.316
Samuel kissed me, but I swear
I didn't kiss him back.

58:29.951 --> 58:31.185
You know what, Alexis?

58:31.719 --> 58:34.288
I warned you that something
like this would happen.

58:34.354 --> 58:35.589
But you ignored me.

58:35.890 --> 58:37.859
So this is all your fault.

58:37.926 --> 58:41.495
-I know.
-The divorce baiting,
sending me on a coffee date,

58:41.562 --> 58:44.464
and then I get violated
at a pool party.

58:44.833 --> 58:46.366
-What?
-Never mind.

58:46.433 --> 58:48.736
You have trust issues, Alexis.

58:48.803 --> 58:52.173
Your walls are up with me
and they won't come down.

58:52.239 --> 58:54.675
And I feel that
that will never happen.

58:54.742 --> 58:59.013
But I can handle knowing
that they may never come down,

58:59.080 --> 59:01.481
but you not trusting me

59:01.548 --> 59:04.651
and then you go out
and you kiss your ex.

59:04.718 --> 59:05.619
[exhales] Wow.

59:05.686 --> 59:08.422
[distant birds

59:11.291 --> 59:12.794
I need time alone.

59:13.293 --> 59:14.561

Come in.

59:30.845 --> 59:32.479
Hi. You busy?

59:32.546 --> 59:35.582
Oh, hey, Debs. Come in.

59:36.184 --> 59:37.551
Take a seat.

59:41.222 --> 59:42.389
You know, I. .

59:42.790 --> 59:45.026
I just wanted to check on you,
so I brought you lunch.

59:45.726 --> 59:50.031
Oh, wow.
That was very nice of you.

59:51.199 --> 59:52.266
Shit, I guess it is lunch.

59:52.332 --> 59:54.969
Yeah. Ahi Poke.

59:55.302 --> 59:57.805
Are you serious?
That is my favorite.

59:57.872 --> 59:59.007
You've always got my back.

59:59.073 --> 1:00:00.374
It wasn't that hard, honestly.

1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:03.211
You're posting
lots and lots of poke pics.

1:00:03.477 --> 1:00:05.479
-Poke pics.
-[laughs]

1:00:05.545 --> 1:00:06.480
Right.

1:00:06.546 --> 1:00:07.614
Hey.

1:00:08.448 --> 1:00:10.051
-About the video. .
-Oh.

1:00:10.118 --> 1:00:14.155
I just want you to know
I was absolutely tortured

1:00:14.222 --> 1:00:15.389
all night about it.

1:00:15.756 --> 1:00:18.026
But I thought if it were me,
I would want to know.

1:00:18.092 --> 1:00:19.961
So I had to send it.

1:00:20.028 --> 1:00:21.328
Hm. I get it. I get it.

1:00:21.395 --> 1:00:23.297
Well, you did the right thing.
Thank you.

1:00:23.363 --> 1:00:25.166
And I'm sorry that you were
put through that.

1:00:25.233 --> 1:00:27.268
And I'm sure it wasn't
an easy decision.

1:00:27.334 --> 1:00:30.171
So thank you again.

1:00:30.238 --> 1:00:32.040
-Okay.
-Right.

1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:36.543
Oh, by any chance,
is there any sriracha?

1:00:37.444 --> 1:00:40.882
Oh, uh, no.

1:00:40.949 --> 1:00:42.216
That's okay. It's okay.

1:00:42.283 --> 1:00:43.885
I always have extra
in the drawer here.

[seductive music]

1:00:50.024 --> 1:00:54.695
Ah, found some sriracha. . Jesus.

1:00:55.429 --> 1:00:57.899
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Debby.

1:00:58.565 --> 1:01:00.400
Debby, what are you doing?

1:01:00.467 --> 1:01:02.502
-[Alexis] Hi, Becky.
-[Marco shushes]

1:01:02.569 --> 1:01:04.638
[Alexis]
Oh, you look so great today.

1:01:04.705 --> 1:01:05.873
Is he in?

1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:08.276
Oh, yes, Mrs. Laguna.

1:01:08.342 --> 1:01:10.111
I'm sure he'll be happy
to see you.

1:01:10.178 --> 1:01:13.447
Oh shit. Oh shit.
Come on. Come on.

1:01:13.513 --> 1:01:14.983
Can you please hold his calls

1:01:15.049 --> 1:01:16.616
and not let anyone disturb us?

1:01:16.683 --> 1:01:18.819

Hi, baby.

1:01:31.465 --> 1:01:33.734
Hi. Oh, good.

1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:35.269
You're closer to forgiving me.

1:01:35.336 --> 1:01:36.337
Oh, we're good, baby.

1:01:36.403 --> 1:01:37.471
-[grunts]
-[Alexis] Yeah.

1:01:37.537 --> 1:01:39.173
-Oh, we're good.
-[chuckles]

1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:41.175
I see you have lunch.

1:01:41.242 --> 1:01:46.014
Awesome. Because
I brought you dessert.

1:01:46.713 --> 1:01:48.715
Oh, wow.

1:01:49.050 --> 1:01:50.051
Wow.

1:01:50.650 --> 1:01:53.254
I know you've been wanting me

1:01:53.321 --> 1:01:55.356
to give you a little show.

1:01:55.422 --> 1:01:57.225
Stay right there, baby.
Right there.

1:01:57.291 --> 1:01:59.559
-I just. . [clears throat]
I want to take it all in.
-[Alexis giggles]

1:01:59.626 --> 1:02:01.862
I want to look at you
for a moment.

Hey, girl.

1:02:04.165 --> 1:02:06.100
[gasps]

1:02:06.167 --> 1:02:08.568
Alexis, nothing happened.

1:02:08.635 --> 1:02:12.173
Debby, tell her
I didn't do anything.

1:02:13.774 --> 1:02:16.543
Oh shit. I didn't do anything.

[sobs]

1:02:20.814 --> 1:02:21.882
Debby.

1:02:22.183 --> 1:02:24.484
Why? Why?

1:02:26.287 --> 1:02:28.156
[crying]

1:02:28.222 --> 1:02:31.792
[emotional music]

1:02:38.432 --> 1:02:40.434
Baby, what are you doing?

1:02:41.302 --> 1:02:42.736
I knew it.

1:02:42.803 --> 1:02:43.570
Knew what?

1:02:44.438 --> 1:02:46.840
When your ex-wife's friends
reached out to you
after your divorce,

1:02:46.907 --> 1:02:48.708
you could have said no,
but you didn't.

1:02:49.243 --> 1:02:52.113
There are plenty of women
who would have slept with you.

1:02:52.579 --> 1:02:54.348
Were you secretly
lusting after them

1:02:54.415 --> 1:02:55.615
while you were married?

1:02:55.682 --> 1:02:57.951
Baby, please stop doing this.

1:02:58.286 --> 1:03:00.221
Stop doing this.

1:03:01.755 --> 1:03:03.557
This is so messed up, Marco.

1:03:03.857 --> 1:03:06.360
[sighs] You asked me
to let my guard down.

1:03:06.427 --> 1:03:08.528
You set us up for disaster.

1:03:08.996 --> 1:03:11.332
You've always had
one foot out the door.

1:03:11.665 --> 1:03:13.467
You have never let me in.

1:03:13.533 --> 1:03:15.069
And this whole
divorce bait thing,

1:03:15.136 --> 1:03:18.839
it wasn't that you just
couldn't trust your friends.

1:03:19.506 --> 1:03:23.211
You couldn't trust me.
You never have.

1:03:23.277 --> 1:03:24.644
[zipper zipping]

1:03:25.712 --> 1:03:26.880
So this is my fault?

1:03:26.947 --> 1:03:28.416
-I didn't say that.
-I'm leaving.

1:03:28.482 --> 1:03:29.883
I. . whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

1:03:29.950 --> 1:03:34.088
This is ridiculous.
We're married, baby.

1:03:37.657 --> 1:03:39.060
Diva still can't work,

1:03:39.559 --> 1:03:41.895
and the company
really loved what I did.

1:03:42.196 --> 1:03:43.830
They offered me a campaign.

1:03:44.831 --> 1:03:47.235
I've already worked it out
with Emma's dad.

1:03:47.301 --> 1:03:48.869
I'll be gone for three weeks.

1:03:51.239 --> 1:03:54.608
Well, I'm so glad
that you worked this all out.

1:03:55.008 --> 1:03:57.611
Uh, let me guess, is your ex
going to be there?

1:03:58.212 --> 1:04:00.248
I shut that down, Marco.
He's not even an issue.

1:04:00.314 --> 1:04:03.717
Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.
You're gonna give all this up
for that jerk?

1:04:03.783 --> 1:04:06.920
-Oh, stop being insecure.
-I'm not insecure.

1:04:07.321 --> 1:04:08.688
That fucker ain't
got shit on me.

1:04:08.755 --> 1:04:12.126
Oh yeah. Well,
at least he's never hurt me.

1:04:13.261 --> 1:04:14.694
[emotional music]

1:04:14.761 --> 1:04:16.730
Neither have I, Alexis.

1:04:20.468 --> 1:04:21.768
Fuck.

[mutters angrily]
Where are you, Alexis?

1:05:01.375 --> 1:05:03.177
Why you do this all the time?

-[door opens]
-[Bob] Marco.

1:05:13.521 --> 1:05:15.323
You shouldn't leave
your back door open.

1:05:15.389 --> 1:05:16.756
Weirdos can just walk right in.

1:05:16.823 --> 1:05:19.759
Present company not excluded.

1:05:20.594 --> 1:05:24.030
Marco. This is a mantervention.

1:05:24.965 --> 1:05:27.235
-A what?
-We're intervening
on your hall pass

1:05:27.301 --> 1:05:29.069
because we know
you're gonna fuck this up.

1:05:29.136 --> 1:05:30.070
Take notes.

1:05:30.504 --> 1:05:33.574
I. . I'm not
on a hall pass, guys.

1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:35.443
Alright?
I don't want to see other women.

1:05:35.875 --> 1:05:37.511
This is
every married man's dream.

1:05:37.578 --> 1:05:39.513
Guys, this isn't a breakup.

1:05:39.813 --> 1:05:42.015
You don't think she's out there
banging that stallion?

1:05:42.082 --> 1:05:44.784
-I do.
-I wouldn't call him
a stallion.

1:05:44.851 --> 1:05:46.720
While you sit here moping,

1:05:46.786 --> 1:05:49.990
she's out there
riding him like a bull.

1:05:50.056 --> 1:05:52.125
-[imitates moaning]
-I bet he's pulling her hair.

1:05:52.193 --> 1:05:54.995
-"Ah, Pull my hair. "
-All of her hair.

1:05:55.061 --> 1:05:57.365
-"Pull my hair, baby. "
-Doing the stuff

1:05:57.431 --> 1:05:59.433
you won't even dream of doing.

1:05:59.500 --> 1:06:01.701
-Fuck stuff.
-All the. .

1:06:01.768 --> 1:06:02.936
Jesus, Bob.

1:06:03.003 --> 1:06:04.538
What the hell's
your problem, man?

1:06:04.605 --> 1:06:06.240
We're just trying
to help you get laid

1:06:06.307 --> 1:06:09.477
before that window of
opportunity closes on you, man.

1:06:09.543 --> 1:06:11.911
Shrinking and shrinking
and shrinking.

1:06:11.978 --> 1:06:14.648
You gotta dive through
before it closes.

1:06:14.714 --> 1:06:16.016
I don't want to get laid.

1:06:16.082 --> 1:06:19.119
[laughs]

1:06:19.186 --> 1:06:20.421
I don't think he does.

1:06:21.121 --> 1:06:24.157
The best part is,
you can do it all

1:06:24.225 --> 1:06:26.826
from the comfort
of your lumpy-ass couch.

1:06:26.893 --> 1:06:28.161
What are you talking about?

1:06:28.229 --> 1:06:30.096
Virtual dating, bro.

1:06:30.163 --> 1:06:32.566
It's what you always said
you wish you got to do.

1:06:32.633 --> 1:06:34.668
You don't even
got to touch a girl,

1:06:34.734 --> 1:06:36.703
so you can do
all kinds of kinky stuff,

1:06:36.770 --> 1:06:39.105
completely disease free.

1:06:39.607 --> 1:06:41.007
Oh, wow, Bob.

1:06:41.074 --> 1:06:43.444
-Mm.
-So you're saying
I can look at naked girls

1:06:43.511 --> 1:06:46.780
-on my computer screen
without even touching them?
-Mm.

1:06:47.214 --> 1:06:49.450
Man, I think
that's called jerking off.

1:06:49.816 --> 1:06:52.586
-Yeah.
-It's a revolution in dating.

1:06:52.653 --> 1:06:55.689
Oh, I remember my first
FaceTime fuck.

1:06:56.056 --> 1:06:59.726
She had me do things that no one
else has ever made me do again.

1:06:59.793 --> 1:07:01.429
Like what? Go on a real date?

1:07:01.495 --> 1:07:03.531
No, like call her repeatedly

1:07:03.597 --> 1:07:05.065
while her phone was on vibrate.

1:07:05.466 --> 1:07:07.934
She wrapped that phone up
and made it disappear.

1:07:08.269 --> 1:07:10.070
Oh, I had that bitch
on speed dial.

1:07:10.136 --> 1:07:13.807
-[imitates moaning]
-I'd call, stop, call, stop,

1:07:13.873 --> 1:07:17.110
-call, stop!
-[moaning]

1:07:17.445 --> 1:07:20.747
We're sorry. Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

1:07:20.814 --> 1:07:23.417
-Mm.
-Mm. Sounds magical.

1:07:23.484 --> 1:07:25.486
Now, there are some things
you might have forgotten

1:07:25.553 --> 1:07:27.987
since you're always jumping
from one marriage
directly into another.

1:07:28.054 --> 1:07:30.658
I, I'd tell you to fuck off
if that weren't true.

1:07:30.724 --> 1:07:33.827
You gotta remember,
the hotter that chick,
the crazier she's gonna be.

1:07:33.893 --> 1:07:35.895
Come on, guys. This is bullshit.

1:07:36.263 --> 1:07:39.633
Alexis is hot,
but she's not crazy.

1:07:39.999 --> 1:07:41.702
She's just really insecure.

1:07:42.269 --> 1:07:44.472
And she makes up things
in her mind

1:07:44.771 --> 1:07:48.842
about people
that aren't true, and, um. .

1:07:49.843 --> 1:07:51.144
Shit, she's crazy.

1:07:52.446 --> 1:07:53.747
-Go on.
-[Estanley] Okay.

1:07:53.813 --> 1:07:56.249
[clears throat]
We've taken the liberty

1:07:56.317 --> 1:08:01.589
of creating you your very own
online dating profile.

1:08:01.655 --> 1:08:04.224
What? That's my computer, man.
I've been looking
all over for it.

1:08:04.291 --> 1:08:06.126
I took it off
your nightstand this morning.

1:08:06.192 --> 1:08:08.962
By the way,
he is really an ugly sleeper.

1:08:09.028 --> 1:08:11.164
[Bob]
Add that to the list. No
sleepovers after getting laid.

1:08:11.231 --> 1:08:15.935
-[Estanley] No, no, no.
-But nonetheless,
you are getting a ton of hits.

1:08:16.002 --> 1:08:17.671
-I am?
-[Bob] Hell yeah, bro.

1:08:17.738 --> 1:08:19.172
You're a successful divorcée

1:08:19.239 --> 1:08:21.040
who looks like one
of those high school teachers

1:08:21.107 --> 1:08:22.776
who bangs all his students.

1:08:22.842 --> 1:08:25.379

-All right. All right.

1:08:32.819 --> 1:08:35.623
Heck, I'll try it.
But just not right now.

1:08:35.855 --> 1:08:36.890
-All right?
-Okay.

1:08:36.956 --> 1:08:38.158
-Yeah, all right.
-Yeah.

1:08:38.224 --> 1:08:39.593
You'll see.
This is good for you.

You know, stress builds up

-Yeah. Okay.

1:08:42.195 --> 1:08:43.830
[Estanley]
It has to just get out.

1:08:43.897 --> 1:08:45.399
-[Marco] Oh, great.
Thanks, doctor.
-Wait.

1:08:45.466 --> 1:08:47.535
-Where are you going?
-You gonna finish this?

1:08:48.469 --> 1:08:50.170
First my laptop, now my pizza?

1:08:50.870 --> 1:08:52.172
You got anything else?

1:08:52.773 --> 1:08:54.207
Get out of here.

Hey. Is the van not here yet?

1:09:31.479 --> 1:09:33.046
Uh, nope.

1:09:33.547 --> 1:09:34.615
Oh.

1:09:36.417 --> 1:09:38.385
Look, uh, you're doing
a great job.

1:09:39.052 --> 1:09:41.354
It's like riding a bike.
You never forget.

1:09:41.422 --> 1:09:43.791
[chuckles] Yeah, but
I don't know how to ride a bike.

1:09:44.257 --> 1:09:46.893
-First time I tried,
I broke my leg.
-How did I not know

1:09:46.960 --> 1:09:48.429
that you didn't know
how to ride a bike?

1:09:48.496 --> 1:09:49.630
I don't know.

1:09:50.163 --> 1:09:52.466
Okay, you know what,
this is my new mission.

-Okay? Wait for it.
-[scoffs] What?

[bachata music on phone speaker]

1:10:05.513 --> 1:10:06.714
Look, I'm not a total jerk.

1:10:07.247 --> 1:10:09.416
Little bit of a jerk.
Not a total jerk.

1:10:09.483 --> 1:10:10.584
I saw that you were sad.

1:10:12.051 --> 1:10:14.622
And when you were sad,

that temptation is everywhere,

1:24:23.969 --> 1:24:26.673
but she trusts you.

1:24:26.739 --> 1:24:28.575
-[chuckling nervously]
-Hi, Marco.

1:24:28.641 --> 1:24:30.610
-Hi, Tina.
-[laughter]

1:24:30.677 --> 1:24:33.178
-Oh, whoa.
-Miss Tina is wearing

1:24:33.245 --> 1:24:35.515
the trashiest thing
in her closet,

1:24:35.582 --> 1:24:38.117
provided for her
by her last conquest

1:24:38.183 --> 1:24:40.420
before he dumped her
for the nanny.

1:24:40.919 --> 1:24:43.155
Fuck you,
baby daddy number three.

1:24:43.222 --> 1:24:46.158
-[all cheering]
-[indistinct] Tina. All right.

1:24:46.825 --> 1:24:50.129
-[Bob] Whoo!
-[Diva] And here we have Julia.

1:24:50.195 --> 1:24:53.666
She chose this piece
because it's the lingerie

1:24:53.733 --> 1:24:56.168
her soon-to-be ex-husband

1:24:56.235 --> 1:24:59.539
provided for the woman
with whom he's cheating.

1:24:59.606 --> 1:25:01.307
She slashed it
with a box cutter,

1:25:01.374 --> 1:25:04.444
but she lost so much weight
from the affair,

1:25:04.511 --> 1:25:07.079
she fits into it now.

1:25:07.647 --> 1:25:09.047
Why let it go to waste?

1:25:09.482 --> 1:25:11.016
-Hi, Bob.
-Looking hot, baby.

1:25:11.083 --> 1:25:13.353
-Yeah. [laughs]
-Yes!

1:25:14.654 --> 1:25:16.589
And we have Estanley.

1:25:16.656 --> 1:25:19.124
Oh, Estanley is here
to remind us

1:25:19.191 --> 1:25:23.996
that all shapes and sizes
can be sexy.

1:25:24.531 --> 1:25:25.964
Just add a little confidence

1:25:26.031 --> 1:25:28.535
and even you can pull
this outfit off.

1:25:28.601 --> 1:25:30.470
[laughing]

1:25:31.170 --> 1:25:32.905
All right. Okay.
Enough, Estanley.

1:25:32.971 --> 1:25:35.742
-Enough.
-Yeah. Go, Estanley. [giggling]

1:25:35.808 --> 1:25:36.776
[gasps]

1:25:37.242 --> 1:25:40.045
[in James' voice]
Are you a dirty boy, Estanley?

1:25:40.112 --> 1:25:41.714
-[giggling]
-Yes, I am.

1:25:41.781 --> 1:25:44.016
-Do you. .
-She completes me.

1:25:44.082 --> 1:25:45.785
-[laughs]
-Are you c. .

1:25:45.851 --> 1:25:48.655
[both laugh]

1:25:48.721 --> 1:25:50.122
Bob, that's the one. .

1:25:50.189 --> 1:25:52.459
-Yeah. [laughs]
-The one. . Oh, Jesus.

1:25:52.525 --> 1:25:55.428
Here we have Miss Beach,

1:25:55.495 --> 1:25:57.896
who is a school teacher by day

1:25:57.963 --> 1:26:01.468
-and a naughty girl by night.
-Yes.

1:26:01.534 --> 1:26:04.036
-[whiplash]
-Oh.

1:26:04.771 --> 1:26:07.272
I teach the hardest lessons
after school.

1:26:07.339 --> 1:26:10.175
I bet you do, Barbie.
I bet you do. [chuckles]

1:26:10.242 --> 1:26:12.845
I got a hard lesson for you.

1:26:13.212 --> 1:26:16.382
Next we have Natalie and Tracey.

1:26:16.449 --> 1:26:21.119
Remember, Marco, you can look,
but you can't touch.

1:26:21.186 --> 1:26:26.024
You should only be dipping your
biscotti into Alexis's coffee.

1:26:26.091 --> 1:26:27.827
-[Marco] Oh, my biscotti.
-[Bob laughing] Yeah.

1:26:27.893 --> 1:26:29.895
-[Marco] Oh, hello.
-Hi.

1:26:30.329 --> 1:26:32.765
-[Tracey] Hi, Marco.
-[Marco] Oh, hi, how are you?

1:26:32.832 --> 1:26:34.867
-[Tracey] Ooh. Biscotti.
-[Marco] Tracey.

1:26:34.933 --> 1:26:35.901
-Oh.
-Okay.

1:26:35.968 --> 1:26:37.537
[all laughing]

1:26:38.505 --> 1:26:43.242
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

1:26:43.308 --> 1:26:44.910
I present to you

1:26:44.977 --> 1:26:50.550
Mrs. Alexis Laguna.

1:26:50.617 --> 1:26:53.085
[soft music]

1:26:58.825 --> 1:26:59.792
Baby

1:27:00.259 --> 1:27:02.762
[chuckling] Baby, baby, baby.

1:27:03.463 --> 1:27:06.265
[romantic music
playing on speaker]

1:27:31.323 --> 1:27:35.127
-[moaning] I've missed you
so much.
-[sighs]

1:27:35.193 --> 1:27:38.230
I missed you, too.
I missed you, too.

1:27:38.297 --> 1:27:39.699
Oh, my God.

1:27:42.935 --> 1:27:44.236
[paddles clatter]

1:27:46.539 --> 1:27:47.740
Who gave those to you?

1:27:47.807 --> 1:27:50.275
Who gave them to you?
Bob, did you. .

1:27:51.744 --> 1:27:52.645
Get over here.

1:27:52.712 --> 1:27:55.180
[soft romantic music]

1:28:04.156 --> 1:28:07.392
-I'm sorry.
I acted like an idiot.
-You did.

1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:10.496
-And I love you for it.
-[chuckles]

1:28:11.263 --> 1:28:15.133
Baby, divorce brought you to me
and me to you.

1:28:15.768 --> 1:28:17.135
No matter what shit
comes our way,

1:28:17.202 --> 1:28:19.739
I wanna work
through it with you.

1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:23.610
I'm not good at that.

1:28:24.042 --> 1:28:25.210
I know.

1:28:26.144 --> 1:28:30.449
And sometimes my insecurities
get the best of me.

1:28:30.516 --> 1:28:31.584
Oh.

1:28:31.884 --> 1:28:33.218
I know that too.

1:28:34.654 --> 1:28:36.088
I wanted to show you that

1:28:36.522 --> 1:28:40.125
-temptation will
always be around.
-Mm-hmm.

1:28:41.059 --> 1:28:44.731
But I've realized that
if I want to stay married. .

1:28:45.464 --> 1:28:47.734
it's got to be
about our relationship.

1:28:49.636 --> 1:28:51.169
I trust you. .

1:28:52.337 --> 1:28:55.173
and you make me happy.

1:28:57.275 --> 1:28:58.711
Do I make you happy?

1:28:59.011 --> 1:29:00.479
Absolutely.

1:29:01.848 --> 1:29:03.683
You're crazy. You know that?

1:29:03.750 --> 1:29:05.117
Oh yeah. [laughs]

1:29:05.183 --> 1:29:06.819
But I prefer your brand

1:29:06.886 --> 1:29:09.555
of crazy over anybody else's.

1:29:10.990 --> 1:29:12.592
I choose you.

1:29:14.894 --> 1:29:17.429
[soft romantic music continues]

1:29:21.768 --> 1:29:22.635
One more thing.

1:29:22.702 --> 1:29:23.770
What?

1:29:26.071 --> 1:29:27.339
Champagne.

1:29:31.410 --> 1:29:33.980
I'm so happy
you two are back together.

1:29:34.479 --> 1:29:37.349
-Champagne, sir.
-Thank you.

1:29:37.784 --> 1:29:39.418
And a grape juice for you.

1:29:39.484 --> 1:29:41.888
-[both chuckle]
-Thank you.

1:29:41.954 --> 1:29:43.321
Grape juice, baby?

1:29:44.657 --> 1:29:48.093
I won't be drinking
for the next seven months.

1:29:49.194 --> 1:29:51.496
Why. . Why is. . Why?

1:29:51.563 --> 1:29:53.131

1:29:53.198 --> 1:29:54.634
Are you. . D. .

Are we pregnant?

1:29:57.003 --> 1:29:58.070
Oh, my God, baby.

1:29:58.136 --> 1:30:01.306
[upbeat Spanish music]

[Estanley]
Can you believe this?

1:30:20.927 --> 1:30:22.461
This is amazing.

1:30:22.527 --> 1:30:23.763
This is amazing.

<i>Yeah. Neither did my dad. </i>

1:31:55.955 --> 1:31:57.556
<i>That's why he cheated. </i>

1:31:57.622 --> 1:31:59.224
[giggling]

1:31:59.291 --> 1:32:01.828
Oh, you like cars, huh?

1:32:02.161 --> 1:32:03.162
Yeah, sure.

1:32:03.662 --> 1:32:06.698
Do you prefer
a straight-six or a V8?

1:32:07.099 --> 1:32:10.136
-Oh, I'm kind of allergic
to tomato juice.
-[laughs]

1:32:10.202 --> 1:32:12.805
-All natural here.
-What? Bravo.

Please let me be called.

I hate being called last like
in fucking sports my whole life.

1:32:45.570 --> 1:32:47.472
Being the chubby kid
in gym class,

1:32:47.974 --> 1:32:49.541
the chubby kid at softball.

1:32:49.942 --> 1:32:50.843
I hated that.

1:32:50.910 --> 1:32:53.411
[music continues]

[cheering and clapping]
