00:06.005 --> 00:09.968
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:17.392 --> 00:19.185
Suzui, good morning.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.105
Hey, Yumeko. Good morning!

00:22.689 --> 00:24.107
Oh, how disappointing.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.776
You and I are friends now, aren't we?

00:28.028 --> 00:30.363
You may call me Yumeko.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.242
Right! Okay.

00:34.325 --> 00:37.704
Yumeko, I really owe you big-time, huh?

00:37.787 --> 00:38.621
What?

00:39.289 --> 00:40.123
Yesterday's...

00:40.707 --> 00:43.960
I can't pay you back right away,
but I promise I will.

00:45.044 --> 00:48.715
That was a gift,
so please don't give it another thought.

00:48.798 --> 00:52.385
Well, not that I have any hopes
of paying it back.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.597
Wait. No, I can't let you do that!

00:59.100 --> 01:01.770
UGLY, FLAT CHEST, TINY BREASTS, DIE

01:02.937 --> 01:05.315
Saotome, what is the meaning of this?

01:05.398 --> 01:06.775
What happened?

01:06.858 --> 01:08.860
- Is this bully--?
- Shut up!

01:09.360 --> 01:14.032
- This happened because I lost to you!
- Come on, put your name tag on.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.576
If you violate the rules,
it'll add to your debt.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.870
Mittens!

01:27.003 --> 01:28.880
Hyakkao Private Academy.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.842
A hierarchy exists
at this prestigious school.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.846
It's not grades or athletic prowess
that gets you to the top.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.225
Just your gambling skills, nothing else.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.994
What happened to Mary isn't your fault.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.456
- It's just the rule at this academy.
- Rule?

03:26.539 --> 03:27.373
Yeah.

03:27.999 --> 03:31.294
A lot of students are from families
of political and business leaders.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.171
If you're gonna rule over others someday,

03:33.254 --> 03:36.007
you need negotiating skills,
the ability to read people's minds,

03:36.090 --> 03:39.344
and also, the ability to come through
when it counts.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.679
- That's the academy's philosophy.
- Oh.

03:42.263 --> 03:46.017
That's why at this school,
the skilled gamblers are the most popular.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.603
Those who aren't become
the object of oppression.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.648
Specifically, there's a hierarchy here.

03:51.731 --> 03:52.732
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM

03:52.815 --> 03:56.444
Donations are made to the student council,
which controls all the gambling.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.947
The amount you donate
determines your rank.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.824
Rankings are announced
on an irregular basis.

04:01.908 --> 04:05.411
If you're in the bottom 100
of the 3,000-strong student body,

04:05.495 --> 04:08.957
you become a non-cooperative student,
a house pet.

04:09.624 --> 04:12.085
Your name is "Fido" if you're male,

04:12.168 --> 04:13.836
"Mittens" if you're female.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.880
Oh, so you also...

04:15.964 --> 04:20.260
Yeah. But thanks to a special donation
of one million, I got that revoked.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.719
Thanks to you.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.722
Oh, my. Congratulations, then.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.724
Thank you from the bottom of--

04:32.939 --> 04:35.441
It didn't used to be this bad.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.278
Everything changed two years ago,

04:38.361 --> 04:40.863
after the current
student council president took office.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.616
Kirari Momobami.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.828
This academy combines
junior high and high school,

04:46.911 --> 04:48.871
but she transferred into the high school.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.250
She became student council president
right off the bat

04:53.543 --> 04:57.213
by gambling with the previous president
for the position.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.590
Oh, my! She became president by gambling?

05:00.258 --> 05:03.720
The members of our student council
are all elite gamblers.

05:04.804 --> 05:09.100
To beat the best of them is mind-blowing.
She started pushing through reforms.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.520
That's when the donation
and Fido-Mittens systems were created.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.480
That's when it started.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.233
When the discrimination intensified.

05:17.900 --> 05:21.112
Well, Mary's case is extreme.

05:21.195 --> 05:25.074
But she roped everyone into her scheme,
then suffered a crushing defeat.

05:25.658 --> 05:30.079
For it to happen on the same day
as donation deadlines, that's bad luck.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.959
Oh, sorry. Did all that talk scare you?

05:35.043 --> 05:40.298
Seriously, the more I hear about it,
the more fringe this academy is.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.680
I'm so glad that I transferred here.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.893
Doesn't this girl ever feel fear?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.939
Full house. That means I win!

05:57.648 --> 05:58.566
Score!

05:59.150 --> 06:02.612
Oh, so there's gambling going on
during recess, too?

06:02.695 --> 06:03.821
Yeah. Oh!

06:03.905 --> 06:07.825
That girl's only a first-year,
but she's a member of the student council.

06:07.909 --> 06:11.287
- She's kind of famous.
- Then she gambled for her position, too?

06:11.370 --> 06:14.332
No, rumor has it
she donated a lot of money.

06:15.124 --> 06:18.920
I hear she's the daughter
of one of Japan's biggest toy makers.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.714
She's filthy rich
and a skilled gambler, as well.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.550
Especially at cards,
they say she's undefeated.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.553
Undefeated? Well, that's amazing!

06:27.637 --> 06:30.932
- I would love to play her--
- Don't even think about it!

06:31.015 --> 06:32.225
Yumeko- senpai?

06:32.308 --> 06:33.142
LAME GIRL

06:33.226 --> 06:36.729
Nice to meet you! I'm Itsuki Sumeragi
of Year One, Flower Class.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.940
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.025
What's this all of a sudden?

06:41.109 --> 06:43.653
Senpai,  everyone's talking about you.

06:43.736 --> 06:47.323
I hear you wiped the floor
with Mary- senpai  on your first day.

06:47.907 --> 06:54.372
I'm confident of my own gambling skills.
I wanted to see how we stack up.

06:54.455 --> 06:57.041
- Yes, I'd love to!
- Hey, Yumeko!

06:57.125 --> 06:59.001
That's what I like to hear!

07:00.294 --> 07:02.755
Damn, garbage again.

07:02.839 --> 07:07.510
- I'm not falling for that again!
- Why is this happening to me? Why?

07:08.094 --> 07:12.014
How did it come to this? Why me?

07:12.598 --> 07:14.517
Why me? Why?

07:14.600 --> 07:18.312
Darn. Mittens, I spilled my coffee.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.189
Clean up the mess, all right?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.741
Hey, guess what?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.828
Sumeragi from the student council
is gonna gamble!

07:33.911 --> 07:35.288
What? Who's her opponent?

07:35.371 --> 07:37.415
You won't believe this. Yumeko Jabami!

07:37.498 --> 07:38.416
No way!

07:38.499 --> 07:40.668
- Where?
- The cafeteria, I hear.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.719
So, about the type of gambling
we'll be doing...

07:49.802 --> 07:52.597
How do you feel
about Double Concentration?

07:52.680 --> 07:55.683
As its name implies,
we're going to use two decks.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.812
In Normal Concentration,
we match numbers,

07:59.896 --> 08:03.024
but in this game,
we match both number and suit.

08:03.274 --> 08:07.945
There are twice as many cards than usual,
but only one pair of matching cards.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.031
I see. That sounds fun!

08:10.114 --> 08:12.450
- I'd love to play.
- Okay.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.411
Now, about how much we bet...

08:16.162 --> 08:18.873
Twenty-one million yen chips
issued by the student council.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.375
What about 20 million yen?

08:23.336 --> 08:28.299
Unfortunately, I no longer have
that much money on me.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.469
I can't possibly raise 20 million yen.

08:31.552 --> 08:35.890
What? You don't look like
such a spendthrift.

08:35.973 --> 08:38.100
Or wait, maybe you had some debt?

08:40.603 --> 08:42.063
Sorry.

08:42.647 --> 08:46.734
No need to worry.
I'll lend you 20 million at zero interest.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.154
What would you gain from that?

08:50.238 --> 08:53.908
To be honest,
20 million is nothing to me.

08:53.991 --> 08:58.788
There's far more value to be had if you
take an interest in our company's cards.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.748
It's part of my PR duties.

09:00.831 --> 09:03.209
In that case, I accept.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.212
Okay. So, this gamble is on, right?

09:07.129 --> 09:08.881
As I explained just now,

09:08.965 --> 09:11.425
I'm breaking out
two brand-new decks of cards.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.095
Our leading product, Raclette!

09:14.679 --> 09:17.431
It's the second-most popular brand
in Japan!

09:17.515 --> 09:22.144
They fit in your hand like a glove!
I hope you buy them!

09:22.228 --> 09:24.480
She's really selling them, huh?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.236
Double Concentration. Let's begin!

09:30.820 --> 09:33.739
After you,  senpai.
You can make the opening move.

09:33.823 --> 09:40.496
I appreciate that. I suppose it won't do
any good to hesitate on the first move.

09:43.791 --> 09:47.587
They're both fours,
but this doesn't count as a match, right?

09:47.670 --> 09:52.091
That's correct. My turn next, right?
Looking for a four of hearts or diamonds!

09:52.675 --> 09:55.094
This game is too hard, isn't it?

09:55.553 --> 09:57.471
If there's only one matching pair,

09:57.555 --> 10:00.850
the odds of achieving it through luck
are one in 103.

10:01.058 --> 10:04.520
Your only hope is to memorize the cards
that have already been drawn.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.274
But there's no way
anyone can memorize 103 cards.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.485
King of diamonds, ace of spades.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.781
The two of hearts,
and the one in the corner's a club...

10:15.865 --> 10:18.284
I'm getting a headache.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.122
The four of diamonds showed up
before, right? Where was it?

10:23.205 --> 10:27.043
I believe it was over here. I got it!

10:27.126 --> 10:29.712
When you get a match, keep going.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.673
Seven of diamonds.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.218
King of clubs. Not a match.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.472
I remember seeing the king of clubs.

10:39.555 --> 10:40.848
Here it is!

10:42.058 --> 10:43.726
Sumeragi's holding her own, huh?

10:51.776 --> 10:54.070
Unbelievable. It's a close match.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.908
Yumeko has 18. Sumeragi's got 22.
Neither is losing ground to the other.

10:58.991 --> 11:04.789
Maybe it's just me, but neither one
has messed up once, right?

11:04.872 --> 11:06.082
What do you mean?

11:06.165 --> 11:09.835
It seems like
after they've flipped over a card once,

11:09.919 --> 11:11.754
they're matching it without fail.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.509
Five of hearts,
I've already seen this one.

11:18.469 --> 11:19.970
I'm telling you, I'm right!

11:20.054 --> 11:22.640
They remember every card
that's been flipped over?

11:23.224 --> 11:25.059
In terms of memory, they're equal.

11:25.142 --> 11:29.397
This is a contest of luck, whether
they can draw a card they've already seen.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.275
Twenty-eight cards left. Yumeko has 36.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.654
Sumeragi has 40.
It's still too close to call.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.490
It's gonna be rough from here on out.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.660
The fewer cards there are,
the easier it'll be to match them.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.745
The game's sure to take a turn now.

11:46.205 --> 11:50.501
I'm impressed,  senpai.
I've never felt so challenged before.

11:50.584 --> 11:53.379
Oh, please. I'm honored.

11:53.462 --> 11:56.048
I'd better bear down now.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.552
Hey, a match. And this one is here.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.803
A match.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.471
Moving on, this one's...

12:02.555 --> 12:05.975
All right! I've seen this one before, too.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.977
Hey.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.562
Oh, wow.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.188
Ten in a row.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.567
Looks like the goddess of good fortune
is on my side.

12:15.151 --> 12:19.155
That's a 14-card lead over Yumeko.
She can't possibly close the gap now.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.072
Oh, no.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.576
That's a miss. Go on,  senpai.

12:23.659 --> 12:28.080
If you miss the next one,
I'm afraid I'm going to end up winning.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.458
Please give it your all!

12:33.294 --> 12:34.545
She missed.

12:40.050 --> 12:45.264
That's a match. I've matched 54 pairs,
more than half the deck, meaning I've won.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.182
Right?

12:51.103 --> 12:55.357
Yumeko, you're 20 million yen in the hole.
What are you gonna do?

12:55.441 --> 12:58.194
You said yourself
you didn't have that kind of money.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.947
- I won again!
- Sumeragi.

13:04.450 --> 13:08.537
Would you mind playing me
just one more time?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.624
I can't possibly repay 20 million!

13:11.707 --> 13:15.711
I had all of the flipped-over cards
memorized, just as you had.

13:16.295 --> 13:21.217
To lose in such a manner,
I can't accept it. One more match, please.

13:27.056 --> 13:31.310
The thing is,
I have a thing for collecting nails.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.278
Look! Aren't they adorable?

13:41.362 --> 13:44.365
Needless to say,
this is only part of my collection.

13:44.448 --> 13:48.410
And there's actually a little secret
to these nails.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.334
You see, these are all real nails.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.758
My, my.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.305
It'd make my life easier
if I could buy them,

14:08.389 --> 14:10.724
but people loath selling them to me,

14:10.808 --> 14:14.186
so most of these are the ones
I plundered through gambling.

14:14.770 --> 14:18.774
Therefore,
if I were to bet 20 million yen...

14:18.857 --> 14:21.193
Oh,  senpai.

14:21.777 --> 14:25.197
I'd love to have those nails of yours.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.706
You're kidding, right?
Put her nails on the line?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.959
What do you say,  senpai ?

14:37.626 --> 14:40.629
Yumeko, there's no need to accept
these ridiculous terms--

14:40.713 --> 14:43.340
Very well. That's acceptable to me.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.092
Hold up, what are you--?

14:45.175 --> 14:49.221
I have to! There's no other way
for me to repay my debt.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.349
Unless you're going
to pay it off for me, Suzui?

14:52.808 --> 14:54.351
No, that's not...

14:55.019 --> 14:56.520
That's the right attitude!

14:57.646 --> 14:59.773
Let's use brand-new cards, all right?

14:59.857 --> 15:02.401
- Is this for real?
- My heart's pounding!

15:03.152 --> 15:04.361
This is insane.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.196
Even at this school,

15:06.280 --> 15:09.408
there's hardly ever any gambling
that involves bodily injury.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.453
No wonder everyone's getting pumped up.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.580
This is no laughing matter.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.501
Shall we begin?
The stakes are 20 million yen for me.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.712
For you,  senpai ,
your fingernails and toenails!

15:21.795 --> 15:23.672
- That all right with you?
- Yes.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.883
Please go first again,  senpai.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.468
Thank you very much.

15:33.682 --> 15:39.063
I've added to my collection yet again.
After all, I've got this match in the bag.

15:39.897 --> 15:46.320
Because I know
what half of the hidden cards are.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.032
These cards, at a glance,
are indistinguishable

15:50.115 --> 15:52.368
from the genuine product in the shops.

15:52.451 --> 15:56.580
But they're a different line I had
produced separately for my personal use.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.875
There's just one thing
that sets them apart.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.962
The pattern stands out
above a certain temperature.

16:03.712 --> 16:07.383
Since my bag is rigged with hand warmers,
after I've laid them out,

16:07.466 --> 16:11.595
for two to three minutes, until they cool,
the pattern remains visible.

16:11.679 --> 16:15.265
After a minute, it disappears.
There's no way anyone can catch on.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.601
I remember all the positions, you see.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.770
So how could I possibly lose?

16:20.229 --> 16:22.022
The reason I chose Double Concentration

16:22.106 --> 16:25.401
was to raise the difficulty level
and protect against lucky guesses.

16:25.484 --> 16:30.572
As long as I know each card, I'm sure
to win, whether it's poker or Old Maid.

16:30.656 --> 16:34.243
It was a struggle memorizing them all,
but the returns were substantial.

16:35.035 --> 16:38.038
Senpai,  those nails are mine!

16:42.376 --> 16:44.837
- A match!
- She lucked out from the start.

16:44.920 --> 16:49.091
By the way, Sumeragi, I hear your family
runs a famous toy manufacturer.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.426
Excuse me?

16:50.509 --> 16:55.139
What's the total market value
of such a large company, I wonder?

16:55.723 --> 16:59.059
Ten billion?
Or closer to 100 billion yen, perhaps?

16:59.977 --> 17:02.604
This gamble
is worth 20 million yen, correct?

17:03.188 --> 17:05.190
It hardly seems worth it.

17:06.817 --> 17:11.113
- What are you talking about?
- A word of advice for you.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.409
If you're gonna put
your family's company on the line,

17:15.492 --> 17:18.537
first make sure
that you're sufficiently prepared.

17:19.496 --> 17:22.583
What's that? My family?

17:24.084 --> 17:27.004
Don't tell me she's...
She's seen through my trickery!

17:27.796 --> 17:29.673
Is she threatening me?

17:30.090 --> 17:33.510
If a toy company were to be exposed
as producing trick decks,

17:33.594 --> 17:35.888
the scandal would run it into the ground!

17:39.433 --> 17:41.143
How much does she know?

17:41.852 --> 17:43.854
Did she spot the disappearing patterns?

17:43.937 --> 17:47.191
No, it's possible
that this is just a bluff.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.611
No! Now that it's come to this,
as soon as it's my turn,

17:50.694 --> 17:54.531
I'll retrieve the cards when I flip them
and switch them out with normal cards.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.617
That's my only hope now.

17:56.700 --> 18:01.580
When it's my turn... When my turn comes...
When my turn comes... When my...

18:01.663 --> 18:03.457
Yumeko.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.634
That makes 54. Meaning I win, right?

18:21.266 --> 18:23.018
No way. How?

18:25.354 --> 18:28.857
If you'd only been more cautious,
I would've lost.

18:28.941 --> 18:35.030
Because... the patterns on the back
are the same as before, aren't they?

18:35.114 --> 18:39.535
If you'd used another deck
that showed a different pattern,

18:39.618 --> 18:44.665
- I would've had to give up.
- You mean you had them all memorized?

18:45.332 --> 18:49.753
If that's true, then this girl
must've been aware of the patterns

18:49.837 --> 18:51.171
from the start.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.216
She pretended not to notice
and kept playing.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.719
Her bitterness after losing
was all an act.

18:58.679 --> 19:02.224
Even so, those patterns are only visible
for two or three minutes.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.185
In that time,
she memorized all the patterns

19:05.269 --> 19:09.731
and matched the patterns to the faces
of the cards that got flipped over.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.860
Is that even humanly possible?

19:14.194 --> 19:18.323
We're done with this game now.
Let's move on to the next one.

19:18.907 --> 19:22.452
What shall we play? Blackjack?
Or baccarat, perhaps?

19:22.536 --> 19:24.621
No, I'm good.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.208
My, my,
are you in any position to decline?

19:28.792 --> 19:29.918
Oh, right.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.547
This time,
why don't we each stake our nails?

19:33.630 --> 19:37.634
Whoever loses has to rip off all
of the other's fingernails and toenails.

19:37.718 --> 19:38.594
But... No...

19:38.677 --> 19:41.180
You requested such stakes,
so you don't mind, right?

19:41.972 --> 19:44.766
They say it's agony
after your nails are torn off.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.352
Every time you exert pressure
on your fingers, there's blood.

19:47.936 --> 19:52.316
Since we're talking all of your nails,
I'm sure it'll hinder your everyday life.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.363
To play with so much on the line...

19:59.156 --> 20:04.119
Just thinking about it makes me smolder!

20:05.787 --> 20:07.623
Now, then, Sumeragi!

20:07.706 --> 20:10.083
This is the chance of a lifetime!

20:10.167 --> 20:14.713
The shame of defeat after rigging this
treacherous game with such confidence.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.591
If you don't redeem yourself now,
when will you?

20:17.674 --> 20:22.888
Let's do it. All you have to do now
is nod yes. Now, then! Come on!

20:23.472 --> 20:25.057
Hurry up!

20:35.525 --> 20:37.402
I can't.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.822
It's not possible.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.744
Please forgive me.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.791
Please forgive me.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.003
Yumeko, can't you see she's pleading?

20:56.213 --> 20:57.422
What a buzzkill.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.065
And that's the story.

21:16.149 --> 21:19.778
Taking Sumeragi down so soon after
transferring here. What an amazing girl!

21:21.113 --> 21:23.490
I bet she's full of herself,
beating a peon.

21:23.573 --> 21:28.996
She only got into the student council
because of a huge donation, anyway.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.874
Hey, wait?
Who was it that recommended her again?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.376
Not another word.

21:36.211 --> 21:40.674
Now, then, about this Yumeko Jabami,
how shall we dispose of her?

21:40.757 --> 21:45.137
This is pretty intriguing.
Why don't we do some meddling?

21:51.018 --> 21:53.061
Are you serious? You're not done gambling?

21:53.145 --> 21:55.814
Stopping now
would be like being left in limbo.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.567
Suzui, didn't you tell me yourself?

21:58.650 --> 22:00.944
That there's gambling going on everywhere.

22:01.028 --> 22:04.239
Where do I go? Join me, Suzui.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.577
Welcome
to the Traditional Culture Research Club.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.078
Esteemed guests,

22:10.162 --> 22:13.290
fortunately, there's an official match
in progress right now.

22:13.790 --> 22:16.335
Would you care to observe
while you're here?

22:17.502 --> 22:18.754
Official match?

22:22.924 --> 22:24.343
The ruling is... death!

22:24.926 --> 22:30.098
Saotome, this match has concluded
with you on the hook for 49.6 million yen.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.975
Forty-nine million?

22:33.268 --> 22:37.773
Saotome, we will contact you regarding
our collection methods at a later date.

22:38.607 --> 22:43.487
Somebody please show her outside.
As I have no more use for her.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.793
All right, place your bets!

24:21.877 --> 24:27.465
- Don't look at me with a scary face!
- Every chip on life is 30 million yen!

24:28.341 --> 24:29.718
I'll kill you, literally.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.011
EPISODE 3: SLIT-EYED WOMAN
