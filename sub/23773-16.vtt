FILM 16

01:08.840 --> 01:11.400
<i>Behold,</i>
<i>the judge standeth before the door.</i>

01:12.320 --> 01:17.640
<i>James, chapter five, verse nine.</i>

02:01.000 --> 02:01.800
Dad!

02:11.920 --> 02:14.120
Did you want him to kill Meglin?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.400
He can barely stand.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.880
Did he get away?

03:23.640 --> 03:25.040
Well done.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.560
-How are you?
-I’ll be fine.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.920
Where’s he heading next?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.600
Don’t you already know?

03:42.520 --> 03:43.920
What did you say?

03:45.560 --> 03:46.760
Damn!

03:48.080 --> 03:51.480
Why was Bergich treating him?
I thought he was doing life.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.880
Are you okay?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.440
So, where’s he headed next?

04:00.520 --> 04:02.520
Andryush, use your brain.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.880
He’s been shot…

04:08.440 --> 04:10.120
maybe even fatally.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.360
He hasn’t seen his parents in eight years.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.880
Use your brain!

04:13.960 --> 04:16.480
-Where are you going?
-Back to the hospital.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.880
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

04:28.160 --> 04:29.560
<i>I love you.</i>

04:33.320 --> 04:38.080
Doesn’t it seem odd to you
that Meglin failed to communicate

04:38.160 --> 04:42.800
the suspected location of Strelok
to the police?

04:44.360 --> 04:45.600
On the contrary.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.920
I find it more than normal.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.440
So you didn’t intend to arrest him.

04:51.080 --> 04:56.080
You immediately decided to take him out
without having authorization.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.080
Did you discuss it ahead of time?

04:58.160 --> 05:01.040
There was no need to discuss anything.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.720
What do you mean?

05:05.800 --> 05:07.800
It wasn’t just another case anymore.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.800
It was something bigger.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.080
CANINE MUSCULAR SYSTEM

05:38.800 --> 05:39.560
Just cut.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.800
You’ll die from the pain
without anesthesia.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.760
I won’t die.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.080
I’m needed.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.480
Operate like this.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.160
Tie it to my hand.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.240
Continue.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.920
VETERINARY CLINIC Do you know where he’s headed?

07:47.080 --> 07:49.880
There’s only one place he’d go now.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.720
Where?

07:53.720 --> 07:56.440
Where he knows he can hurt me.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.280
POLICE

08:01.360 --> 08:04.200
We have roadblocks.
We’re checking every car. Nothing.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.200
Search harder.
He’s going there. He’s got no one else.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.360
We ran his name.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.560
Anufriev’s parents died in a car crash
while he was still in boot camp.

08:11.960 --> 08:15.200
-How can they be dead?
-Maybe he’s headed elsewhere.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.640
-Meglin’s orphanage.
-What?

08:21.080 --> 08:24.520
Meglin wants to kill him!
So we don’t get to him!

08:24.600 --> 08:25.800
Get in your vehicles!

09:01.280 --> 09:02.880
ORPHANAGE No. 12

09:37.400 --> 09:38.920
I told you, Meglin.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.720
I want people to know the truth.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.560
Three vaccinations, three series.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.960
Nine, 40…

09:51.440 --> 09:53.320
365.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.120
I’ll pray for humanity. I’ll get through to you.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.960
I’ll make you listen to me.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.840
I won’t let you go on killing.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.880
I got here before you.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.600
There, on the second floor…

10:19.000 --> 10:20.280
there are 15 of them.

10:23.680 --> 10:27.960
Altogether, there are 40 souls. Forty.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.400
This series is complete.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.800
I’ll get some rest,

10:36.400 --> 10:37.800
gather my strength…

10:38.960 --> 10:40.640
wait for you die.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.760
You’re the only one who can kill me.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.120
Well, and then…

10:48.480 --> 10:49.440
the third series.

10:50.040 --> 10:50.920
No.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.560
It’s over.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.520
Freeze! No one move!

11:45.160 --> 11:46.600
Only 40.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.800
I surrender. It was me that called you.
I surrender.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.680
I surrender.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.240
What are you doing here?

13:32.360 --> 13:35.240
Hey, pal, dig me a grave…

13:36.840 --> 13:38.440
and have a coffin ready.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.960
Give him some money.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.160
All right.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.640
He’ll get out and continue killing,
Andryusha.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.360
That’s impossible.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.920
He signed a confession.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.720
He’ll get life. No question about it.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.760
Once he’s in prison,
I’ll make sure he never gets out.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.480
He’s got it all worked out already.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.080
Last time, the court found him insane.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.760
And it will again.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.600
He’ll escape
from the psychiatric hospital.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.920
He’ll escape and start the third series.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.840
I want him dead just as much as you do.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.200
Maybe even more than you.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.560
What do you want from me? What can I do?

14:55.040 --> 14:57.400
Give me a chance to get close to him.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.920
Then I’ll improvise.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.240
“I’ll improvise.”

15:06.120 --> 15:06.960
No.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.640
This thing is too big.
Higher-ups, the press.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.280
You know that.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.160
Then the lives of those he kills
from now on will be on you.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.520
Or are you already used to that?

15:25.640 --> 15:28.160
Are you lecturing me on morality?

15:36.840 --> 15:37.960
Let’s go.

15:41.120 --> 15:45.320
He’s being taken to Moscow tomorrow
for evaluation.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.960
3:00 p.m. From jail to the airport.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.000
You need to see Bergich.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.520
Later.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.560
We have to see this through first.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.200
I promise.

17:04.680 --> 17:05.880
Who lives here?

17:08.359 --> 17:09.960
The backup copy.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.160
Hello. Vitalik is expecting you.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.839
-Hello.
-Some tea?

17:42.240 --> 17:44.240
-Hello.
-Hi, Vitalik.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.440
-What are you playing?
-Take a guess.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.360
I want you to meet Vitalik.
And this is Esenya.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.640
My…

17:54.120 --> 17:55.520
My friend.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.120
Now she’s your friend too.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.920
-Nice to meet you. Esenya.
-Hello.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.800
I haven’t seen you in a while.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.040
-I heard you were sick.
-I’m fine now.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.600
So, let’s begin?

18:11.640 --> 18:13.080
Your training is over.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.880
Vitalik helps me.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.520
You see, I don’t trust computers.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.960
Computers can be hacked.
They can be infected by a virus.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.440
But a person, that’s a different story.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.560
I don’t know how computers work,

18:30.280 --> 18:32.360
but I know how people work.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.480
Have you seen my archive?

18:35.680 --> 18:37.920
-I have.
-They tried to steal it twice.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.320
Once, they set fire to it.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.560
I made a backup copy.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.040
Vitalik is an eidetic.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.560
-Do you know what that means?
-No.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.520
He has a phenomenal, flawless memory.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.720
He can remember everything
he’s ever heard or seen.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.560
Every word, every letter.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.280
Everything that I found out, I archived.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.040
And I saved it with him, as well,
just in case.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.720
He knows everything, all I did.

19:14.760 --> 19:15.760
Thank you.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.600
He has the answers to all your questions.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.160
He knows what was in the missing pages…

19:26.880 --> 19:28.760
what happened to the missing people.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.560
The backup copy.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.680
The most complete.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.840
It’s impossible.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.280
Vitalik.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.960
Hello. Hi, Vitalik.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.720
What are you playing? Take a guess.

19:51.520 --> 19:55.000
I want you to meet Vitalik.
And this is Esenya.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.560
My… My friend.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.920
Now she’s your friend too.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.040
Nice to meet you. Esenya.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.920
Hello.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.720
I haven’t seen you in a while.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.520
I heard you were sick? I’m fine now.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.200
So, let’s begin?

20:09.280 --> 20:11.400
Your training is over.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.040
Vitalik helps me.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.640
-You see, I don’t trust computers.
-That’s enough. I get it.

20:21.880 --> 20:22.920
You can ask him.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.600
You wanted to find out something.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.760
Go ahead.

20:31.920 --> 20:35.600
This was why you wanted to train with me.

20:37.000 --> 20:37.880
Come on.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.480
Need help?

20:45.640 --> 20:48.040
-Irina Ignatovich.
-I don’t want to. Stop it!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.200
Irina Ignatovich.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.640
Case number 345.

20:54.160 --> 20:57.680
Date of birth: 1967.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.760
Place of birth: Kirov.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.680
Diagnosis: paranoid schizophrenia.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.480
The official version:

21:04.560 --> 21:10.120
Went missing in 1991
under obscure circumstances.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.560
She’s currently being held
at a neuropsychiatric hospital

21:14.640 --> 21:18.720
in the care of Dr. Bergich
under the name Olga Berestova.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.400
Ask him.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.080
Olga Berestova.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.520
Olga Berestova. Case number 244.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.200
Date of birth: 1968.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.760
Place of birth: Moscow.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.960
Diagnosis: paranoid schizophrenia.

21:46.040 --> 21:49.600
The patient committed several murders
attributable to this illness.

21:50.040 --> 21:56.040
<i>Since 1991,</i>
<i>she was married to Andrei Steklov.</i>

21:56.120 --> 21:59.760
This is Maksim Ognarev.
I was telling you about him.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.520
And this is my wife Olya.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.760
-It’s a pleasure.
-It’s a pleasure.

22:02.840 --> 22:07.920
<i>The initial evaluation indicated</i>
<i>a combination of syndromes,</i>

22:08.000 --> 22:12.160
<i>including schizophrenia, as well as</i>
<i>antisocial personality disorder.</i>

22:12.240 --> 22:15.360
<i>The patient was prescribed</i>
<i>hospital treatment</i>

22:15.440 --> 22:18.000
<i>under the supervision of specialists.</i>

22:18.080 --> 22:21.320
<i>She was later allowed</i>
<i>to live with her family.</i>

22:22.840 --> 22:27.760
<i>Socialization within the family</i>
<i>had a positive but unsustainable effect.</i>

22:27.840 --> 22:29.360
<i>The disease continued to progress.</i>

22:29.440 --> 22:33.920
<i>The patient grew increasingly withdrawn</i>
<i>from her social surroundings.</i>

22:36.920 --> 22:40.480
<i>The patient would actively interfere</i>
<i>in the spouse’s work.</i>

22:40.560 --> 22:41.200
Olya!

22:41.960 --> 22:46.680
<i>Periods of remission would be followed</i>
<i>by psychosis and outbursts of aggression.</i>

22:52.400 --> 22:55.360
<i>At the insistence of the spouse,</i>
<i>Andrei Steklov,</i>

22:55.440 --> 22:59.480
<i>the patient was involuntarily committed</i>
<i>to a psychiatric facility</i>

22:59.560 --> 23:01.800
<i>and underwent treatment for a second time.</i>

23:18.080 --> 23:21.080
<i>Due to the progression</i>
<i>of psychotic symptoms,</i>

23:21.160 --> 23:25.720
<i>complete social isolation</i>
<i>was strongly recommended.</i>

23:32.520 --> 23:35.360
<i>Having been placed in a long-term care</i>
<i>psychiatric hospital,</i>

23:35.440 --> 23:38.880
<i>Olga Berestova spent over two years there.</i>

23:43.120 --> 23:46.960
<i>During a period of sustained remission,</i>
<i>she gave birth to a daughter.</i>

23:49.240 --> 23:50.240
What?

23:54.360 --> 23:55.600
I thought of a name.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.680
What is it?

23:58.320 --> 23:59.520
Esenya.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.800
Do you like it?

24:04.560 --> 24:05.640
It’s an unusual name.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.320
Well, she is very special.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.200
What’s the difference?
Just switch the two pictures!

24:17.280 --> 24:19.560
No. For me, it’s a big difference.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.520
What’s the difference? Tell me.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.000
<i>Having violated all norms</i>
<i>of professional conduct,</i>

24:24.080 --> 24:28.600
<i>Andrei Steklov talked the chief physician</i>
<i>into switching the medical records</i>

24:28.680 --> 24:30.080
<i>of the two patients.</i>

24:30.680 --> 24:31.880
What’s the reason?

24:47.160 --> 24:49.400
<i>And, instead of Olga Berestova,</i>

24:49.480 --> 24:52.920
<i>it was Irina Ignatovich</i>
<i>who remained in the hospital.</i>

25:03.800 --> 25:05.000
MEDICAL RECORD
BERESTOVA, OLGA

25:05.080 --> 25:09.840
<i>With the assistance of his colleagues</i>
<i>in the federal prosecutor’s office,</i>

25:09.920 --> 25:13.160
<i>Olga Berestova’s passport</i>
<i>and personal information</i>

25:13.240 --> 25:16.240
<i>were transferred to the identity</i>
<i>of Vera Steklova.</i>

25:57.320 --> 25:59.720
<i>The disease continued to progress.</i>

25:59.800 --> 26:03.560
<i>In order to put an end</i>
<i>to further violent outbursts,</i>

26:03.640 --> 26:07.200
<i>Vera Steklova was secretly eliminated.</i>

27:23.920 --> 27:25.520
My mother was a murderer.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.640
But you still haven’t told me
who killed her.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.480
Does it matter?

27:45.640 --> 27:47.440
She was simply stopped.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.960
Was it my father?

27:58.240 --> 28:01.640
It wasn’t him.
She asked him to, but he couldn’t.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.040
But there’s no way he didn’t know.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.600
Did he have someone else do it?

28:23.840 --> 28:24.840
He loved her.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.640
You call that love?

28:32.720 --> 28:35.880
It’s easy to kill an enemy.
It’s hard to kill someone you love.

28:37.160 --> 28:38.680
You have to truly love them.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.760
I’m just like her, aren’t I?

28:42.200 --> 28:43.400
Who am I?

28:49.960 --> 28:51.360
You’ll find out soon.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.760
POLICE

29:55.960 --> 29:57.680
What are you going to do?

29:57.760 --> 29:59.160
I’m not sure yet.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.320
Get out of the truck! Go! Go!

31:02.080 --> 31:04.400
They say he’s escaped twice.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.880
There’s no way.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.920
I’m telling you.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.960
-This loser?
-I know, right?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.120
Hands in the air!

33:08.600 --> 33:09.640
Get out of the car.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.720
No, I’m not getting out.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.840
I’m not getting out.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.000
Meglin, I need to be in Moscow!

33:16.080 --> 33:17.600
I need to be in Moscow!

33:17.680 --> 33:19.880
I have an evaluation! I-- I’m a phenomenon! I need to be studied!

33:22.240 --> 33:24.800
So that there aren’t others like me!

33:24.880 --> 33:25.720
Remember this place?

33:25.800 --> 33:28.720
When one of ours died,
we’d bury them here.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.400
Meglin, don’t do this! Meglin! They’re buried here too.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.720
Meglin!

33:39.800 --> 33:41.400
Meglin, please, I’m--

33:41.480 --> 33:43.000
I’m begging you!

33:43.080 --> 33:44.520
Fifteen souls.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.120
I want you to suffer.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.080
Meglin.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.880
I want you to feel terrified
and powerless.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.520
Meglin, don’t!

33:58.600 --> 34:00.560
No! I’m begging you!

34:01.520 --> 34:04.720
-You’ll lie here with those you killed.
-Don’t!

34:06.720 --> 34:08.679
No! Don’t!

34:09.280 --> 34:13.000
Just shoot me! Shoot me!

34:14.880 --> 34:16.080
Stop!

34:16.159 --> 34:19.159
-Don’t! Don’t!
-Lie there and picture it!

34:19.760 --> 34:22.800
-Maybe there is something after this!
-Shoot me!

34:24.120 --> 34:25.679
They’re waiting for you there!

34:25.760 --> 34:27.280
Stop!

34:27.880 --> 34:29.159
Listen to her, Meglin!

34:29.600 --> 34:32.639
-Meglin, listen to her!
-You can’t do this! Please!

34:32.719 --> 34:36.159
-Don’t! I’m begging you!
-What if it’s just as terrifying?

34:36.239 --> 34:37.800
-Let me handle this!
-Don’t!

34:37.880 --> 34:40.120
-I’m begging you, stop!
-Just shoot me!

34:41.480 --> 34:43.840
-But it’s for eternity!
-Shoot me!

34:43.920 --> 34:46.920
-Don’t, Meglin, please!
-I think you’ve earned this.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.800
-Please, don’t!
-You’ve earned it.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.520
I’m begging you! Stop!

34:51.600 --> 34:52.719
You earned it.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.159
Stop! Don’t! Don’t!

34:55.239 --> 34:57.880
-Stop!
-Meglin, listen to her!

34:57.960 --> 35:00.800
Don’t! I’m begging you, please! -Please, don’t!
-You can’t do this!

35:03.800 --> 35:05.400
I’m begging you! Stop!

35:06.280 --> 35:07.760
Don’t! I--

35:07.840 --> 35:11.560
Just shoot me! Shoot me!

35:15.080 --> 35:18.200
And I’ll pay for what I’ve done…

35:19.320 --> 35:20.960
here or there.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.680
It was Steklov!

35:30.160 --> 35:31.080
What?

35:31.160 --> 35:34.000
It was her father
who helped me to get out!

35:34.080 --> 35:35.840
So that I’d stop you!

35:37.240 --> 35:38.720
What the--

35:39.720 --> 35:41.600
The blood is on his hands!

35:42.200 --> 35:43.160
No.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.240
He’s lying.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.240
Tell me that he’s lying!

35:58.720 --> 36:01.280
Don’t listen to him. Don’t!

36:48.280 --> 36:49.680
You asked me…

36:51.040 --> 36:52.640
who killed Olya.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.120
It doesn’t matter.

36:59.080 --> 36:59.960
It was me.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.360
<i>She begged me.</i>

37:07.040 --> 37:08.840
<i>I’m tired.</i>

37:09.320 --> 37:11.760
<i>I can’t live like this. Please, do it!</i>

37:11.840 --> 37:13.320
<i>Those were her words.</i>

37:14.960 --> 37:16.560
<i>This wasn’t living.</i>

37:19.400 --> 37:21.480
I was her friend too.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.080
I…

37:24.960 --> 37:26.360
loved her.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.760
<i>So, Rodion, is that it?</i>

38:15.600 --> 38:17.760
So, Rodion, is that it?

38:22.640 --> 38:23.360
That’s it.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.080
That’s it.

38:58.120 --> 39:02.080
And you claim you never saw Meglin again.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.240
No!

39:03.880 --> 39:08.840
Here’s the record in the visitors log.
It proves you were there on the ninth.

39:08.920 --> 39:11.320
I was there that evening to see Bergich!

39:12.640 --> 39:14.920
And you didn’t even pause to see Meglin?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.200
Why?

39:17.320 --> 39:19.600
His symptoms had exacerbated that day. He had already stopped recognizing people.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.040
Just check the medical record.

39:28.440 --> 39:31.840
How did Meglin get the knife
he used to kill himself?

39:32.240 --> 39:33.720
They searched him every day.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.480
I don’t know.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.280
Rodion.

41:52.840 --> 41:54.040
Rodion.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.000
Wake up.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.640
Please. Rodion.

42:12.680 --> 42:14.000
Please.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.520
Wake up. I’m here.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.840
Wake up.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.680
Wake up!

42:29.480 --> 42:31.080
Wake up!

42:31.520 --> 42:32.960
Wake up!

42:33.440 --> 42:34.480
Rodion.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.080
Wake up!

42:40.760 --> 42:42.160
I’m begging you!

42:45.160 --> 42:47.240
I’m right here! I’m here.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.400
I promised you…

43:51.720 --> 43:53.400
I would hold your hand.

43:57.280 --> 43:58.680
I’m holding it.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.360
Do you feel it?

44:18.520 --> 44:19.840
I love you.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.920
I talked to the doctors.

45:05.400 --> 45:09.120
They say unanimously
that Meglin’s condition was so severe

45:09.200 --> 45:11.400
that he couldn’t have killed himself.

45:13.160 --> 45:15.040
Are you accusing me of something?

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
No, Esenya Andreyevna.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.800
We have a different task.

45:42.720 --> 45:45.760
Despite all the problems
caused by Meglin’s work,

45:46.360 --> 45:48.640
we can’t deny that it was effective.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.640
We took a risk.

45:52.600 --> 45:56.040
We knew full well that Meglin’s method

45:56.120 --> 45:59.520
could save a lot of lives.

46:01.200 --> 46:02.880
And that outweighed…

46:04.720 --> 46:06.200
his method.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.520
Do you think you understood it?

46:12.040 --> 46:14.080
How would you describe it?

46:18.480 --> 46:20.440
There was no method.

46:22.800 --> 46:26.600
He simply tried
to really pay attention to people.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.160
Why?

47:30.200 --> 47:31.440
What’s the point?

47:34.480 --> 47:36.000
I forgive you.

47:37.080 --> 47:38.680
I’ll never forgive myself.

47:41.120 --> 47:42.320
Then live like that.

47:44.360 --> 47:45.360
What for?

47:50.800 --> 47:52.280
For me.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.800
Well, Esenya Andreyevna…

48:57.920 --> 49:00.120
we don’t have any more questions.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.720
But here’s a proposition.

49:11.880 --> 49:14.200
Sadly, people will always be people.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.400
There are criminals…

49:18.760 --> 49:20.160
and there’s us.

49:21.600 --> 49:24.000
And we propose that you take his place.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.480
With the broadest authority.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.880
Staff, finances--
everything can be worked out.

49:32.680 --> 49:34.640
I’m not interested.

49:36.200 --> 49:38.240
-Why not?
-I don’t want to.

49:41.520 --> 49:42.840
Don’t rush.

49:44.160 --> 49:45.840
Think about it.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.200
I’m listening.

50:54.880 --> 50:57.480
<i>I only wanted to know one thing.</i>

50:57.560 --> 50:59.880
<i>How do you feel…</i>

51:00.880 --> 51:02.480
<i>now that you’re alone?</i>

51:05.040 --> 51:06.760
<i>You won’t catch me.</i>
