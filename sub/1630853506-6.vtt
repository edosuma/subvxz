Who's who?

02:05.440 --> 02:07.960
You bring in new blood,
I should know about it.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.200
They're still my people.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.040
What are you talking about?

02:11.040 --> 02:12.520
The American.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.880
What American?

02:13.880 --> 02:15.520
Yo, don't treat me like an idiot.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.240
Man still connected
in this, you know.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.320
Hey! Will you remember
who you're talking to?

02:21.840 --> 02:23.080
Sorry.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.760
I don't know anything
about any American.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.120
So what have you heard?

02:31.160 --> 02:33.680
Stop. Please stop.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.680
Let him go. Let him go!

02:37.960 --> 02:39.320
Who's the American?

02:39.320 --> 02:41.000
What American?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.560
Let him go!

02:44.840 --> 02:46.880
Fine, we'll tell you.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.320
We were introduced to someone
by our lawyer.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.760
Who?

02:59.760 --> 03:01.480
He's an old guy from New York.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.120
All we know is he's found a way

03:03.120 --> 03:04.960
to bring uncut coke
into the country.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.560
And what does he want from you?

03:06.560 --> 03:09.080
He was looking for distributors.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.520
We offered our services.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.520
Without telling me?

03:12.520 --> 03:14.440
This is our thing.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.880
None of my people do business
under my nose

03:17.880 --> 03:20.480
without, A, telling me,

03:20.480 --> 03:22.520
and B, cutting me in.

03:22.520 --> 03:23.600
Come on.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.080
I want to meet this American.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.840
Dad, lunch is ready.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.360
Be right there, darling.

04:35.080 --> 04:38.840
The community centre grand opening
is in two days' time,

04:38.840 --> 04:44.040
and I can confirm in attendance
will be His Highness,

04:44.040 --> 04:48.800
the Lord Mayor of Bristol,
and his wife.

04:48.800 --> 04:55.120
So it is of vital imperative...ness

04:55.120 --> 04:59.480
that the whole day goes
without a hitch. Capiche?

05:00.760 --> 05:05.000
I have assigned each of you
tasks to be completed

05:05.000 --> 05:09.160
on the day to the utmost
of your abilities.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.360
You two, car park supervision.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.560
You two, the sweet treats stall.

05:15.560 --> 05:18.160
I'm taking control of
the community centre.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.920
I'm receiving the keys
from the mayor.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.720
Yeah, well, until then, I'm Billy
Big Bollocks around here. Capiche?

05:23.720 --> 05:25.200
Since when does she say "capiche"?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.760
Since she watched Goodfellas
last night. Ah.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.120
Notice there are two Portaloos,
yeah?

05:32.120 --> 05:34.880
Portaloo one is for plebs.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.040
This one...

05:38.360 --> 05:39.920
Very important pees only.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.840
Very important persons, plural.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.600
The only people I want to see
doing their business in here

05:45.600 --> 05:48.840
is the Lord Mayor and/or his wife.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.840
You want to see them doing number
ones or number twos in there?

05:51.840 --> 05:54.240
Both. Happily.

05:54.240 --> 05:59.160
So the VIP latrine
is now padlocked.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.360
I'm entrusting the key to you,

06:04.360 --> 06:06.360
because you're a member
of the landed gentry,

06:06.360 --> 06:08.520
and therefore know
how to respect a toilet.

06:08.520 --> 06:13.120
You and I are the only persons
authorised to grant access.

06:13.120 --> 06:17.160
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I get the keys to the VIP shitter.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.760
Hey, no. I don't want any salty
language in front of the Lord Mayor.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.240
What about his wife?
Especially not his fucking wife.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.520
Oh, Sergeant Haines.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.520
Diane, can I have a word?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.640
Ma'am.

06:31.400 --> 06:35.880
If Sergeant Haines needs a dump,
let her use the posh crapper, OK?

06:35.880 --> 06:37.240
Excuse me.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.440
Through here, ma'am.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.200
You were right.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.680
I believe the preparation
and selling of illegal drugs

06:51.680 --> 06:55.200
has been going on here, and I think
it involves your offenders.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.920
I reckon we take 'em down right now.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.880
Well, right now,
I have no concrete evidence.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.680
Happy to smack it out of 'em
old school.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.160
I know for a fact
that beanpole's a crier.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.240
I just need you to keep
your eyes peeled

07:06.240 --> 07:07.920
and report anything suspicious
to me.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.840
Are you officially deputising me?

07:09.840 --> 07:12.200
I don't have authority
to officially deputise you.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.240
How about deputise me unofficially?

07:14.240 --> 07:16.080
That would be meaningless,

07:16.080 --> 07:19.400
and give you literally no
legal authority whatsoever.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.160
But will you...do it?

07:26.320 --> 07:28.360
I unofficially deputise you, yes.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.720
Remember, eyes peeled.
Report anything suspicious.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.000
I won't let you down.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.600
Who got married?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.040
My ex Lara.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.400
Oh. Are you OK with that?

08:00.400 --> 08:02.040
Today is not about me, Greg,

08:02.040 --> 08:04.040
it's about you getting
a promotion.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.320
Come on, what are you going to do
when you get in to work?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.720
Well, I'm going to walk into
my boss's office... Ah, wrong.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.760
You are marching into your boss's
office... Am I?

08:10.760 --> 08:13.120
..with total confidence and you're
going to give it to him

08:13.120 --> 08:15.560
with both barrels. Go.
Excuse me, sir, sorry to bother you,

08:15.560 --> 08:19.480
but I have worked here 11 years,
so would you please contemplate

08:19.480 --> 08:23.600
the possibility of considering
making me a partner, please, sir?

08:23.600 --> 08:25.400
That was both barrels?
Oh, yeah, baby.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.920
No, Greg, you are marching in there
and you are saying,

08:27.920 --> 08:30.280
"If you don't make me a partner,
I am walking out that door

08:30.280 --> 08:31.800
"and I ain't coming back."

08:31.800 --> 08:33.760
And then, you're going to march up
to Anne-Marie

08:33.760 --> 08:35.400
and you're going to take her
for a drink,

08:35.400 --> 08:38.400
before you bring her back here
and you bang her brains out.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.880
On this counter, on the couch,
against the wall, on the carpet.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.640
Generally around the flat,
I get the idea, yeah. Yeah.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.280
Go get 'em.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.920
No, like this. I can't do it.
You can do it.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.320
I don't want to play the trumpet.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.720
Well, you're going to play the
trumpet, OK? I don't want to.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.160
What is going on? I played the
trumpet when I was your age, OK,

09:21.160 --> 09:22.880
and I loved it. I loved it.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.400
Till your grandfather told me it was
for fairies. What's going on?

09:26.400 --> 09:29.080
Effie's going to learn to play the
trumpet to a very high standard,

09:29.080 --> 09:30.880
and she's going to get
a music scholarship,

09:30.880 --> 09:32.560
and that's going to
pay for her school.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.920
OK, one more time, like this.
I don't want to.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.760
Just blow the bloody trumpet!
John!

09:38.280 --> 09:40.840
You don't have to play it, darling.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.560
Daddy's just kidding. Aren't you?

09:43.560 --> 09:45.120
Yep.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.560
Sorry, darling,
it's just Daddy's little joke.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.960
OK, enough.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.520
What is going on with you?

09:58.960 --> 10:00.240
Talk to me.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.560
I'll just go check on her.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.240
Sir, I've worked here for 11 years,

10:21.240 --> 10:23.680
and I really feel it's time
you made me a partner.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.640
Come.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.520
I have a Zoom in five,
so make it quick.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.000
Sir, I've been working here
for 11 years,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.320
so... I really feel...

10:40.040 --> 10:41.840
..it's time that...

10:43.800 --> 10:46.040
..we had a casual Friday.
No, I don't like 'em.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.360
Fine, just wanted to bring it up.
My door is always open.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.320
But close it on your way out.
Thank you.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.000
I ain't telling you nothing
unless I have it in writing.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.840
Immunity and early release
is a big ask.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.240
So is snitching on The Dean.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.680
I have to speak to the CPS,
and that takes time.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.480
You don't have time.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.120
Something big is going down
that'll nail The Dean to the wall.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.640
I'd hate for you to miss it.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.000
What's going down?

11:27.000 --> 11:30.320
Immunity and early release
in writing.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.760
Yo, Margie,
I'm stepping out for a bit.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.120
Margie, it's been made safe.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.560
Oh, well, then, I don't know why
I'm so upset

11:52.560 --> 11:56.240
that my six-year-old daughter
found a gun in our house.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.280
OK, here's the thing.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.320
Me and a couple of others
found a bag of money

12:02.320 --> 12:04.200
doing community service.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.640
I mean, a lot of money.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.520
And instead of going to the cops,
we kept it.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.040
Tom found my cut,

12:11.040 --> 12:12.800
threatened to burn it and hid it,

12:12.800 --> 12:17.120
but I found it, and I was going to
split to Brazil.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.600
Instead, I paid off your mortgage.

12:21.440 --> 12:26.400
Now, it turns out the money
belongs to this drug dealer,

12:26.400 --> 12:28.000
this real bad guy,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.440
who threatened to clip us
if we don't deal drugs for him

12:31.440 --> 12:33.520
to pay our debt,
but now he wants more.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.920
And if we go to the cops,
we incriminate ourselves.

12:38.920 --> 12:43.120
So we figure the only way
to get him off our backs

12:43.120 --> 12:44.800
is to send him down ourselves.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.000
Our plan is to get him
pulled over by the cops

12:48.000 --> 12:50.800
with ten kilos of cocaine
in the trunk of his car,

12:50.800 --> 12:53.600
but he never handles
product himself,

12:53.600 --> 12:55.880
and he never leaves London,

12:55.880 --> 13:02.480
so we're using this grift
called the brass bunkum,

13:02.480 --> 13:04.360
which involves a gun.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.400
Goodnight, Frank.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.720
That's the whole truth, Margie,
nothing but.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.000
Oh, I believe you.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.440
You sure you're OK doing this?

13:36.440 --> 13:39.480
I am one of the world's
great gift wrappers, Greg.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.240
I mean being around
all this cocaine.

13:42.240 --> 13:45.880
Oh, how did it go with
the promotion and Anne-Marie?

13:45.880 --> 13:48.200
I've got to get going.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.800
Well, good luck.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.600
You OK?

14:41.600 --> 14:43.440
I'm fine.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.840
Let's do this.

15:19.440 --> 15:23.320
May I introduce, from New York,
Mr Ralf Rostelli?

15:23.320 --> 15:26.280
Ralfie. Call me Ralfie.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.360
You want something?

15:31.760 --> 15:33.480
From the minibar?

15:33.480 --> 15:35.960
We got tiny whiskies,

15:35.960 --> 15:40.520
tiny vodkas, full-sized Pellegrinos.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.600
No, thanks.
What about nuts?

15:43.560 --> 15:45.840
Got eight different
kinds of nuts here.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.920
I'm here about your requirements.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.440
All business, this guy.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.560
When I met these two,
we had a drink, broke bread,

15:56.560 --> 15:59.600
I got to stare 'em
in the whites in their eyes.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.720
That's how we do things
where I come from.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.240
I'm here for new business,
Mr Rostelli, not new friends.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.200
Ralfie, call me Ralfie.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.360
Open your shirts.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.680
Pardon me?
You think I'm wearing a wire?

16:17.680 --> 16:19.440
Open your shirts.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.360
Screw you, open yours.

16:21.360 --> 16:25.400
Lay a hand on me,
I'll break every finger on it.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.480
In all five boroughs of New York,
I am known.

16:29.480 --> 16:33.120
Ask anybody about Ralf Rostelli
out of New York, they'll tell you.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.400
Our business here is done.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.120
Mr Rostelli, please, wait, sir.

16:42.120 --> 16:46.360
I ain't dealing with two-bits,
don't show respect.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.160
So long.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.120
Please. Apologise.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.600
Fuck him.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.920
This guy's product makes yours
look like Shake n' Vac.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.400
It's mad pure.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.920
You want this deal.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.680
I apologise.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.560
We just have to be careful.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.840
I'll have the pistachios, please.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.160
That's better.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.800
OK, he'll be gone for 30 minutes.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.040
You sure? I ran this place
for 12 bloody years.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.560
All right, I was only bloody asking.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.880
I don't need your help.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.640
John.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.080
John, I want to tell you something,

18:05.080 --> 18:07.600
because I haven't got anyone else
to tell.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.840
I'm on tenterhooks.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
Every night when I go to bed,
and every morning when I wake up...

18:20.000 --> 18:22.520
..there's someone in my flat
with me.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.680
It's that policeman
that died in that fire.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.680
Are you saying...

18:31.680 --> 18:33.320
.."I see dead people"?

18:35.400 --> 18:37.240
No. No, I...

18:38.240 --> 18:41.520
I know that it's all in my head, but...

18:44.840 --> 18:46.240
Doesn't matter.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.800
One of my other clients,
a Bristol businessman,

18:49.800 --> 18:52.000
John Halloran,
is in hot water financially.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.320
Needs to make a lot of money
very quickly.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.640
Now, for years, Halloran's family
have been importing

18:56.640 --> 18:59.600
and exporting brake pads through
the port of Bristol.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.120
It's a legitimate family business,

19:01.120 --> 19:05.280
so if certain illicit products
were included in his shipments,

19:05.280 --> 19:07.640
customs would have no reason
to suspect it.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.520
We've got a test run tomorrow.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.760
Ten keys.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.600
Ten keys?

19:15.320 --> 19:16.520
How much are you charging?

19:24.200 --> 19:25.840
Are you out of your minds?

19:25.840 --> 19:28.160
Street value to you
is three times that.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.360
I want to meet this Halloran.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.160
I want to sample the product.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.680
Bring both to London
and we'll have...

19:44.680 --> 19:47.240
Hey. I made this trip
out of courtesy

19:47.240 --> 19:51.640
cos these two said you're the guy,
but no more visits.

19:51.640 --> 19:55.760
You want to see Halloran,
or the product, you come to Bristol.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.520
I never leave London.
Make an exception.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.880
But I don't even know who you are.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.720
I'm Ralf Rostelli out of New York.
Who the fuck are you?

20:07.480 --> 20:09.680
When? Where?

20:09.680 --> 20:13.480
Tomorrow, Park Street Hotel, 2pm.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.280
One more thing.

20:22.280 --> 20:26.280
I don't play with kids.
These two - out.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.160
But this is our deal.
We made this happen.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.800
You're out.
Eh? What the fuck?

20:29.800 --> 20:31.920
Nah, man. What's going on?

20:31.920 --> 20:35.560
That's not fair! We made the deal.
We're in this.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.040
Reach Up
by Perfecto Allstarz

20:59.400 --> 21:00.840
Committed, good.

21:03.360 --> 21:08.040
How 'bout you, young fella? Come on,
give it a shot. Guess how many.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.680
Oi! Tabards off.

21:35.640 --> 21:39.480
Face painting here. Do you want
your face painted, madam? No?

21:39.480 --> 21:41.120
Get your face painted
by a celebrity.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.240
Greg?

21:45.120 --> 21:46.440
Sophie.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.760
This is Greg, my ex-husband.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.480
G'day, mate.
G'day.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.200
Good... Good day. Good day to you.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.840
So what do you do, Greg?

21:57.840 --> 22:01.600
I'm a lawyer. Well-paid lawyer.
What about yourself?

22:01.600 --> 22:02.960
Professional skydiver.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.160
Is that even a real job?

22:04.160 --> 22:05.880
Yes, it is.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.120
Darling...

22:08.520 --> 22:10.800
..pretty please will you win me
another teddy bear

22:10.800 --> 22:12.280
at the shooting range?

22:12.280 --> 22:14.280
Oh, look at you.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.680
Oh, hi.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.520
This is Sophie, my wife.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.320
Ex-wife. And this is...

22:22.320 --> 22:24.000
My name's Dante.
Of course it is.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.960
So how did you two meet?

22:27.680 --> 22:35.440
Well, Greggles rocked on over to me
after our kick boxing class and...

22:35.440 --> 22:38.080
Woo. Ooh!
..swept me off my feet.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.480
Literally, cos it was
kick boxing class.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.080
Nice.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.520
What about you two?
Erm...

22:44.520 --> 22:46.400
..we met on a parachute jump.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.200
Her fifth. My sixtieth.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.680
Oh, Christ, that must get
fucking boring.

22:50.680 --> 22:51.880
You jump, mate?

22:51.880 --> 22:54.360
Oh, no, Greg tends to play it safe.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.280
Not true.
We went inline skating recently,

22:57.280 --> 22:59.280
and I didn't wear kneepads
or a helmet.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.520
By inline skating,
do you mean rollerblading?

23:01.520 --> 23:02.760
Rollerblade is a brand name,

23:02.760 --> 23:04.600
so you should really call it
inline skating.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.880
Like I say, Greg plays it safe.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.560
I'm not going to apologise for
respecting trademark law, Sophie.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.800
You should know that about me.

23:09.800 --> 23:13.080
One of the reasons she fell in love
with me. Oh, yes. Yeah. Mm.

23:13.080 --> 23:16.000
OK, well, we should get going.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.480
It was nice to meet you.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.600
Yeah.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.720
Aw!

23:26.160 --> 23:28.280
Penny for your thoughts.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.800
I'm thinking I'd still be married
if I was more like him.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.440
Darling, you can't pull off tie dye.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.640
I mean the sort of bloke
who jumps out of planes.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.200
No, stop it, all right?

23:36.200 --> 23:38.880
That's exactly the thinking
that's holding you back, OK?

23:38.880 --> 23:40.880
Asking out Anne-Marie,
asking for a promotion.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.040
You don't do things, Greg,
because you think,

23:43.040 --> 23:45.440
"Well, I'm not the sort of bloke
who jumps out of planes,"

23:45.440 --> 23:47.720
but blokes who jump out of planes
only jump out of planes

23:47.720 --> 23:50.240
because they...
they jump out of planes.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.120
Who said that originally?
Was it the Dalai Lama?

23:53.120 --> 23:56.600
Oi! Less getting acquainted,
more faces painted.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.880
Oh, shit.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.280
What you doing here?

24:17.280 --> 24:19.680
I know you're not
looking for my approval,

24:19.680 --> 24:23.000
but you made something real
happen here,

24:23.000 --> 24:26.160
something valuable. I just...

24:26.160 --> 24:27.640
I want to support that.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.600
Right.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.400
Thanks.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.760
See? The bloody woman.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.400
The one you framed
for a crime she didn't commit?

24:46.400 --> 24:49.680
Look, if I have to choose between
the individual and the cause,

24:49.680 --> 24:52.520
I choose the cause.
That doesn't make you a good person.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.280
You think she's the cancer
in your group.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.560
She's not, you are.

24:56.560 --> 24:57.880
How so?

24:57.880 --> 25:00.280
We've sold drugs,

25:00.280 --> 25:02.920
we've taken dirty money,
we've threatened people.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.200
For the greater good.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.280
Ends justify the means, do they?

25:07.280 --> 25:08.760
If what we've done ever gets out,

25:08.760 --> 25:11.920
any good your organisation
has achieved will be torpedoed.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.640
Yeah, well, I know that, don't I?

25:13.640 --> 25:16.200
There's not much I can do
about that now. Wrong.

25:16.200 --> 25:19.320
If you were in the army, you'd be
left alone in a room with a revolver

25:19.320 --> 25:20.840
to do the honourable thing.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.880
Come on, guess how many.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.200
Diane.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.880
Oh! I don't feel good.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.160
Help me.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.400
Frank.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.720
Frank!

25:38.720 --> 25:40.280
What is going on?

25:40.280 --> 25:41.680
I felt faint.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.720
I'm good now.

25:42.720 --> 25:45.360
Oh, you've been on your feet
all day. You need a little lie down.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.760
I'm good. I'm good.

25:46.760 --> 25:49.080
Diane, permission to take Frank
for a lie down?

25:49.080 --> 25:50.760
I'll allow it.
Thank you.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.520
Oh, dear, Frank.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.080
Have a lie down.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.880
Oh, oh, got you.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.040
Oh.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.600
There.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.120
Thank you, darling.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.800
Do we have a deal?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.960
Everything you have on The Dean
for early release

26:33.960 --> 26:37.240
and immunity from further charges.
You won't get a better offer.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.040
Are you signing or not?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.960
You said something big
is going down. What?

26:58.440 --> 27:03.360
The Dean's taking receipt of
ten keys of pure Colombian cocaine.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.440
Park Street Hotel, 2.00pm today.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.600
Come on, quickly! Quickly.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.240
Better hot step.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.560
Has he arrived?
No, no sign of him so far.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.440
Park in here. OK.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.120
Hello, Diane.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.120
Deputy Diane, Ma'am.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.840
Yes, hello, Deputy Diane.

28:29.840 --> 28:33.200
I have eyes on all the offenders,
as requested.

28:33.200 --> 28:36.080
All are here,
present and accounted for.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.680
Thank you, dep...er, deputy.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.600
Ma'am, I don't know if
you're free next Wednesday,

28:42.600 --> 28:44.880
but they're doing a little
graduation ceremony

28:44.880 --> 28:48.520
for us PCSOs, and we're allowed
to bring a plus-one.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.360
My mum has bingo that night,
so she can't attend,

28:51.360 --> 28:53.280
so I just wondered whether you...

28:53.280 --> 28:54.880
I don't think I can make it, Diane.

28:54.880 --> 28:57.400
No, I mean, just to be clear,
I'm inviting you as a friend.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.400
This isn't a lesbian thing.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.960
I don't know if you are,
not that there's anything wrong...

29:01.960 --> 29:04.280
Don't get me wrong,
we've all dabbled.

29:04.280 --> 29:08.480
But just so you know,
I am partial to the cock,

29:08.480 --> 29:09.760
if you catch my drift.

29:09.760 --> 29:12.000
I do. But I have to go now, Diane.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.120
OK, roger that. Over.

29:24.040 --> 29:25.600
This guy.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.000
Change of plan.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.480
Halloran is jumpy.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.480
Wants to meet some place
with lots of people.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.240
Take the back exit.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.680
Charity car wash. Donate!

30:31.880 --> 30:33.000
Showtime.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.040
I'm not sure I can do this.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.560
You can't jump out of a plane
without jumping out of a plane.

30:38.560 --> 30:39.880
Still makes no sense.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.280
Go!

30:43.280 --> 30:44.640
Come on, John.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.360
So good to see you again.
Nice drive down?

31:48.360 --> 31:51.320
So, where is he, Halloran?

31:51.320 --> 31:55.160
Oh, he's just popped to the...
Over there.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.640
He what?

31:56.640 --> 31:58.640
You wait here, I'll fetch him.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.760
Keep him talking.

32:02.760 --> 32:05.000
What am I going to talk to
a drug dealer about?

32:11.800 --> 32:14.320
So were you affected much
by Brexit or...?

32:18.880 --> 32:20.760
What's busier for you,
Christmas or New Year?

32:20.760 --> 32:22.760
We don't need to talk.
No, definitely not.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.160
All right?
Yep.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.040
Any deal should be done
by now.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.920
What are they doing in there,
using the spa?

32:38.520 --> 32:40.000
Diane.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.200
Diane, something awful
has come to pass in the VIP latrine.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.680
Well, how did that happen?
You're the only one with a key.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.520
I'm so sorry. I've let you down.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.440
Yeah, you have.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.120
Show me the crime scene.

32:59.800 --> 33:02.040
Which room is this man in?
Is he a guest at the hotel?

33:02.040 --> 33:03.400
He arrived about 2.00.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.960
I've been here since 11.00.
I haven't seen him.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.600
How do we get to
the car park? Quick.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.040
Where the hell is John?

33:24.080 --> 33:25.840
Oh, Christ on a bike.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.000
I've identified the matter,
and it's just soup.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.760
I repeat, it is not vomit,
it's just vegetable soup.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.640
It won't open.

33:57.640 --> 33:59.240
Why is it shut?
What?

34:02.960 --> 34:04.240
All right, stand back.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.960
I'm going to try and bash it in
from this side, all right?

34:06.960 --> 34:08.760
That seems like a bad idea.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.600
One, two, three.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.520
Never seen Del Boy
falling through the hatch?

34:12.520 --> 34:15.160
I don't watch TV. This is classic,
everyone's seen this.

34:15.160 --> 34:16.440
Watch, watch.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.720
Just get a bit of a...

34:17.720 --> 34:20.280
You ready?
Stand back for safety, OK?

34:22.560 --> 34:24.240
Look at Trigger's face!

34:24.240 --> 34:26.040
He doesn't know what's happened.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.320
You OK?

34:41.320 --> 34:43.120
Yeah.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.000
You've landed on top of the door.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.600
Yeah, I know.

34:49.680 --> 34:50.880
No?

34:50.880 --> 34:53.040
Are you going to
try for them birds?

34:53.040 --> 34:55.200
Oh, I told you he was going to fall
before you saw it.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.680
I ruined the punch line.

34:56.680 --> 34:57.960
My fault.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.160
David Jason would be furious.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.480
Where's Halloran?

35:07.440 --> 35:08.680
John?

35:11.560 --> 35:13.160
This is nice, isn't it?

35:13.160 --> 35:14.920
Stuff for the kiddies
and everything.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.880
You're on! Let's go.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.280
I can't.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.720
We're all depending on you.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.600
I'll just let you down,
then, won't I?

35:23.600 --> 35:25.640
I might get a toffee apple.
Do you fancy one?

35:25.640 --> 35:26.920
No, thanks.

35:29.920 --> 35:33.920
Look, we all make mistakes,

35:33.920 --> 35:36.440
but this is our chance to fix them,

35:36.440 --> 35:38.040
and then we can go back
to our lives.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.960
I don't think I have a life, Myrns.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.480
Three months ago, I had a life.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.800
You know, I had a job,
I had a little bit of money,

35:44.800 --> 35:46.360
a little bit of respect.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.480
Now I'm a drug dealer
who smokes crack.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.320
I just failed, Myrns.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.880
Dad was right, you know?
I'm a failure.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.080
You're not a failure.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.560
I'll tell you what you are.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.880
You're a self-pitying little bitch.

36:00.880 --> 36:01.920
Mm?

36:01.920 --> 36:07.520
You are a middle-aged white man
with all the privilege in the world.

36:07.520 --> 36:10.600
Your dad bullied you,
so you're scared to show weakness

36:10.600 --> 36:15.040
or ask anyone for help, which means,
when the shit hits the fan,

36:15.040 --> 36:18.600
you implode. So, here you are,
sitting in the gents',

36:18.600 --> 36:21.680
having a panic attack,
instead of sucking it up,

36:21.680 --> 36:23.480
taking responsibility,

36:23.480 --> 36:26.560
and doing your bloody part
to help us sort this mess out.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.120
OK, one more time.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.360
Urgh!

36:52.720 --> 36:54.280
That looked like hard work.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.320
It's mainly soup, people.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.520
The only vomit is my own.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.680
Are you sure you don't fancy
a toffee apple? No.

37:02.680 --> 37:06.080
Smart. I mean, it looks like fruit,
but it's all sugar, innit, really?

37:06.080 --> 37:08.520
And that stuff's like crack.
You should sell these.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.600
This is a joke. I'm out of here.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.440
You, come with me
round the back.

37:15.880 --> 37:17.440
Shall we do some business?

37:47.960 --> 37:49.480
Huh?

37:49.480 --> 37:54.280
When it's cut, you'll be dealing
for months on this load alone.

37:54.280 --> 37:57.040
So, decision time. You in, you out?

38:11.720 --> 38:13.640
No, no, hand it to high pockets.

38:18.720 --> 38:19.880
Yeah.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.160
I'm not driving up to London
with product in my car.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.320
Well, then, who is?

38:38.320 --> 38:40.400
You are.

38:40.400 --> 38:43.080
No, no, no. I've done my part.

38:43.080 --> 38:46.040
Listen, I never handle product.

38:46.040 --> 38:49.440
Unless you deliver that to me,
I'll take my money back.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.320
Back away from the van and put your
hands in the air. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:52.320 --> 38:54.200
Back the fuck up.
Whoa!

38:54.200 --> 38:56.120
Wait! What the fuck is going on?

38:56.120 --> 38:58.400
All we want is our money.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.240
Where is it?

39:07.120 --> 39:08.800
Look, we've got no beef with you.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.880
But if you move,
we will shoot you too.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.640
Put the gun down. Let's talk.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.240
Fuck you, Ralf.

39:14.240 --> 39:16.840
You shouldn't have kept us out of
our own fucking deal.

39:16.840 --> 39:20.360
You know who you're fucking with?
I'm Ralf Rostelli out of New York.

39:20.360 --> 39:23.480
And I'm Rani Rekowski
out of Bristol.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.960
The deal is off.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.960
The deal is done.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.560
No money, no product.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.800
This is your mess.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.960
I want that product in London
by 7.00 today,

39:49.960 --> 39:53.120
or I'll find you and I'll hurt you.

39:53.120 --> 39:57.800
I don't give a fuck if you're
Ralf Rostelli out of New York.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.600
Yeah, I need a fix on
a grey Maserati saloon heading north

40:20.600 --> 40:22.240
out of Bristol towards London.

40:22.240 --> 40:25.640
Yankee Whisky 20
Oscar Juliett Romeo.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.800
Charity car wash. Donate!

40:35.760 --> 40:37.360
Thank you.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.720
Handsome car for a dreamy man.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.000
How about a donation for my bucket?

40:47.000 --> 40:50.160
Yeah, sure, absolutely.
There you go. Thank you.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.960
Thank you, bye. Bye-bye. Take care.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.960
Now, to accept the key,

41:01.960 --> 41:04.440
the new custodian.

41:04.440 --> 41:07.440
A woman who's selflessly
devoted her life

41:07.440 --> 41:11.560
to the community she loves
so deeply through her organisation,

41:11.560 --> 41:14.400
the Bristol Justice Collective -
Myrna Okeke.

41:25.040 --> 41:28.640
This community centre stands now
as a beacon of hope

41:28.640 --> 41:33.240
and rejuvenation,
helping families, local kids,

41:33.240 --> 41:36.800
people with addiction issues.
But when we first saw it,

41:36.800 --> 41:41.000
it was old and decrepit
and out of date.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.080
A bit like me.

41:44.600 --> 41:48.440
The same way that this place
needed updating,

41:48.440 --> 41:49.800
I do too.

41:51.200 --> 41:56.200
Which is why I have decided
to resign from

41:56.200 --> 41:58.560
the Bristol Justice Collective,

41:58.560 --> 42:03.120
and hand this key
to someone who will bring youth

42:03.120 --> 42:10.120
and imagination
and integrity to the organisation.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.640
Claire...

42:15.640 --> 42:17.560
..if you'd like to come up here.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.680
Hey, boss.

42:43.680 --> 42:46.720
What the fuck is this?

42:51.120 --> 42:54.880
I hereby declare Faircrest Hill
Community Centre open.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.200
Please open the boot, sir.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.080
Is there a problem, officer?

43:05.080 --> 43:07.600
I need you to open the boot, sir.

43:38.920 --> 43:41.960
The Met have been after a London
drug dealer known as The Dean

43:41.960 --> 43:44.360
for years, but could never
pin anything on him.

43:44.360 --> 43:47.400
Yet I've just arrested him with
ten kilos of cocaine in his boot.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.840
How did I do that?

43:56.640 --> 43:59.600
I give up. How did you?

43:59.600 --> 44:04.320
This is ten kilos
of pure, uncut cocaine.

44:06.840 --> 44:09.080
Was it good cocaine?

44:10.200 --> 44:11.840
Why would I give drugs
to a drug-dealer?

44:11.840 --> 44:14.360
I mean, I don't want to tell you
your job, but I think,

44:14.360 --> 44:17.160
traditionally, drug-dealers give
you drugs in exchange for money.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.560
Isn't that the usual
business model?

44:19.560 --> 44:22.840
Back the fuck up! Whoa! Whoa! All we
want is our money. Where is it?

44:25.120 --> 44:26.920
You know who you're fucking with?

44:26.920 --> 44:28.760
I'm Ralf Rostelli out of New York!

44:28.760 --> 44:31.240
And I'm Rani Rekowski
out of Bristol.

44:34.760 --> 44:37.080
Who is he? Who's who? The American.

44:37.080 --> 44:38.640
What American?

44:38.640 --> 44:40.040
No money, no product.

44:40.040 --> 44:42.080
The deal is done.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.280
I think you put the cocaine
in his car.

44:44.280 --> 44:45.560
Where am I?

44:45.560 --> 44:48.240
How would you even go about
planting drugs in a man's car?

44:53.640 --> 44:55.680
What kind of car was it?

44:55.680 --> 44:58.480
It's just that I've put cocaine
in so many cars over the years,

44:58.480 --> 45:00.280
they all just merge into one.

45:00.280 --> 45:03.160
Charity car wash. Donate!

45:03.160 --> 45:05.920
When were we supposed
to have done this?

45:05.920 --> 45:08.520
I've been at the community centre
all day.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.920
Handsome car for a dreamy man.

45:13.280 --> 45:15.480
How about a donation for my bucket?

45:15.480 --> 45:18.080
I've been at the...
..community centre... ..all day.

45:18.080 --> 45:19.400
All day.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.840
Mwah!

45:23.280 --> 45:25.840
I suppose you've been at
the community centre all day.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.040
Is that where I am?

45:27.040 --> 45:30.520
All day I've been at... Don't tell
me. The community centre?

45:30.520 --> 45:31.720
You are a good detective.

45:31.720 --> 45:34.200
You never let them
out of your sight? No, ma'am.

45:34.200 --> 45:37.120
There was no instance where you were
otherwise occupied?

45:43.680 --> 45:45.360
No, ma'am.

45:45.360 --> 45:47.600
You're saying, under caution,

45:47.600 --> 45:50.880
that you've had no dealings with
a drug-dealer known as The Dean?

45:50.880 --> 45:54.280
I'm saying that if I were a clever
and ambitious policewoman

45:54.280 --> 45:55.800
who just caught a major criminal

45:55.800 --> 45:58.840
that the Met Police have been
chasing for years,

45:58.840 --> 46:01.280
I wouldn't question how it happened.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.000
I'd take the win.

Are you all right?

47:51.520 --> 47:53.440
I need help, Ruth.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.320
How'd it go?

48:13.320 --> 48:15.000
It worked.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.080
And you're safe?
Are you OK?

48:18.680 --> 48:20.560
I'm glad.

48:20.560 --> 48:23.160
Now I want you to leave.

48:23.160 --> 48:26.040
Huh?
I'm not mad, OK? No, I'm past that.

48:26.040 --> 48:28.840
It's just you can't live here
any more, you're too dangerous.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.920
There's no more danger.
No, you say that,

48:30.920 --> 48:33.320
but it will happen again.
It always does.

48:33.320 --> 48:36.760
I'm trying to be a better person,
Margie, I really am.

48:36.760 --> 48:38.880
I know I've said that before
many times,

48:38.880 --> 48:40.880
and I was handing you a line,

48:40.880 --> 48:43.480
but this time I'm serious.

48:43.480 --> 48:45.880
I want to be here.

48:45.880 --> 48:48.480
I love you. I love my grandkids.

48:48.480 --> 48:51.200
And we love you, and that's why
I would like you to go.

48:53.360 --> 48:55.320
I don't... I don't follow.

48:55.320 --> 48:58.120
Well, in a month's time,
in a year's time,

48:58.120 --> 49:00.680
you are going to do something
to hurt us.

49:00.680 --> 49:03.760
You're going to wind up back inside
or let us down some other way,

49:03.760 --> 49:06.120
and you are going to
break my kids' hearts!

49:06.120 --> 49:09.160
I promise I won't.
You won't be doing it intentionally.

49:09.160 --> 49:12.480
It's not your fault, Frank,
it's who you are.

49:12.480 --> 49:14.480
Fucking up is in your DNA,

49:14.480 --> 49:17.680
and when you do that,
you cause a lot of pain,

49:17.680 --> 49:19.480
so I need you to leave.

49:22.680 --> 49:26.760
You say you don't want to
break your kids' hearts,

49:26.760 --> 49:28.640
but the kids want me here.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.080
Tom will hate you
for sending me away.

49:31.080 --> 49:32.800
He will hate you.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.280
Probably.

49:34.280 --> 49:38.000
But I would rather that he was just
a bit sad now than devastated later.

49:53.680 --> 49:55.240
Here's your cut.

49:56.760 --> 49:59.960
And, erm...here's the line.

50:02.080 --> 50:04.920
It's a good chunk of change
you've got there.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.520
Enough to help you start again.

50:09.080 --> 50:11.040
What you going to do?

50:11.040 --> 50:13.440
Ben and I are going to move
to Weston-super-Mare.

50:13.440 --> 50:15.920
Going to open a food place
down there.

50:15.920 --> 50:17.800
Is that you, yeah?

50:17.800 --> 50:19.080
Yeah.

50:20.280 --> 50:22.120
Well, good luck.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.320
You too.

50:46.960 --> 50:51.080
You know, you're welcome to see your
grandchildren whenever you want,

50:51.080 --> 50:54.000
but, erm...just so you know...

50:55.640 --> 50:57.240
We've spoken to a lawyer...

50:58.440 --> 51:01.280
..and we're suing you
for wrongful dismissal,

51:01.280 --> 51:05.280
breach of contract,
and workplace bullying,

51:05.280 --> 51:08.400
and we are going to take you
for every penny you have.

51:08.400 --> 51:10.080
But don't take it personal, Dad, OK?

51:14.360 --> 51:15.920
It's just business.

51:26.400 --> 51:28.960
I, Diane Pemberley,

51:28.960 --> 51:32.240
do solemnly swear
to serve Her Majesty the Queen

51:32.240 --> 51:35.240
in the role of
police community support officer.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.200
Sir, I've been working here
for 11 years,

51:56.200 --> 51:58.360
so either you make me a partner,

51:58.360 --> 52:00.840
or I walk out that door,
and I ain't coming back.

52:04.320 --> 52:05.920
Why did you do that?

52:07.760 --> 52:10.840
You can't jump out of a plane
without jumping out of a plane.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.320
What's that mean?

52:12.320 --> 52:13.560
Goodbye, Spencer.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.560
Excuse me.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.840
I'm middle-aged, divorced,
and unemployed.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.400
But I think you're terrific,

52:31.400 --> 52:34.160
and I wondered if you'd like
to grab a bite to eat sometime.

52:34.160 --> 52:36.800
Well, I could eat now.

52:38.040 --> 52:39.560
Then shall we?

52:42.800 --> 52:45.640
So how long have you been divorced?
About 18 months.

52:45.640 --> 52:47.000
Oh, me, three years.
Really?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.680
My wife said that living with me
was like being trapped down a well.

52:51.360 --> 52:54.440
My husband said that I'm as boring
as a Russian novel. Really?

53:18.200 --> 53:20.440
What happened? Why are you leaving?

53:20.440 --> 53:23.480
Did you and Mum have an argument?
Is she making you leave?

53:23.480 --> 53:26.400
No. Your mum begged me to stay.

53:27.720 --> 53:30.320
You said you wouldn't abandon us.
You promised.

53:35.400 --> 53:37.000
You can't trust what I say, kid.

53:38.200 --> 53:39.840
I'm no good.

53:53.600 --> 53:55.640
Hi. I'm Gabby.

53:55.640 --> 53:58.040
Hello, Gabby.

53:58.040 --> 54:01.680
I'm a drug addict, and an alcoholic,

54:01.680 --> 54:07.240
and I have anger management issues,
so... I'm a real mess.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.760
I realised I need help.

54:12.520 --> 54:16.760
An hour ago, I had a bag of cocaine
underneath my nose,

54:16.760 --> 54:19.920
but I flushed it down the toilet,

54:19.920 --> 54:22.800
and I can't afford
to keep doing that.

54:22.800 --> 54:25.920
I mean, people bang on about
the cost of booze and cigarettes,

54:25.920 --> 54:28.360
but the cost of cocaine
is scandalous!

54:28.360 --> 54:30.560
Do you know how much a rock costs?

54:30.560 --> 54:32.160
Course you do!

54:53.600 --> 54:57.200
Refreshments and light snacks are
available at the rear of the train.

54:57.200 --> 55:00.120
Do you want a sandwich or something?
No, I'm good.

55:13.880 --> 55:16.040
Could I have a ham
and cheese sandwich, please?

55:16.040 --> 55:19.600
Toasted?
Erm...no, thank you.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.080
Any ketchup or mayonnaise?

55:21.080 --> 55:22.880
Erm...

55:22.880 --> 55:26.000
Mustard, please.
No mustard. Ketchup or mayonnaise?
