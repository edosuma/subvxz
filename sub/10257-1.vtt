01:58.808 --> 01:59.968
Mingo!

02:08.351 --> 02:09.477
There he is!

02:09.519 --> 02:10.679
-l see him !
-Come on!

02:34.577 --> 02:37.512
-Lookit, l`m bleeding.
-Give me my money.

02:37.547 --> 02:40.482
-What about my money?
-You ruined my clothes.

02:40.517 --> 02:41.882
That`s sixteen dollars.

02:48.258 --> 02:49.384
This is your dog?

02:49.426 --> 02:50.859
Friend of mine, man.

02:50.894 --> 02:53.124
You give me money.
l want my money.

02:53.163 --> 02:55.188
Get off, man.

02:58.368 --> 02:59.960
l just want my dog.

03:00.003 --> 03:01.197
What about my taxi?

03:01.237 --> 03:03.330
Yo, fuck your taxi, man.

03:11.247 --> 03:12.578
You finished?

03:29.599 --> 03:30.759
Come on.

03:44.881 --> 03:46.041
Well, l`m late.

03:51.121 --> 03:54.284
You ever see a burial at sea?

03:54.324 --> 03:55.518
They take a guy...

03:55.558 --> 03:58.755
and they wrap him up
in sailcloth.

03:58.795 --> 04:01.662
They sew him up
with a five-inch shell...

04:01.698 --> 04:03.825
so it goes down,
down the deep six.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.767
You know what l mean?

04:05.802 --> 04:07.599
Poor Mingo.

04:07.637 --> 04:08.797
Jeez.

04:10.540 --> 04:11.939
You have to dig so deep?

04:13.710 --> 04:16.372
Let`s hope somebody digs for me
this deep when l`m gone.

04:28.958 --> 04:31.825
A whole week
after D-day Okinawa...

04:31.861 --> 04:34.193
we didn`t have one solid meal.

04:34.230 --> 04:37.722
Evey time, you know,
they`d blow us to go to chow--

04:37.767 --> 04:40.031
Not a goddamn thing here.

04:40.069 --> 04:42.765
We`re halfway down the ladder,
you know, and...

04:43.606 --> 04:46.006
l`m hungy, God damn it!

04:46.042 --> 04:49.102
-l can tell you that.
-We got to eat soon, man.

04:49.145 --> 04:50.510
Look at this dump.

04:50.547 --> 04:53.744
People are becoming
goddamn rabbits.

04:53.783 --> 04:56.581
Goddamn.
People don`t eat meat anymore.

04:56.619 --> 04:58.644
We got to get something to eat.

04:58.688 --> 05:01.987
All that complaining
ain`t making shit better, man.

05:02.025 --> 05:03.219
We got to get food.

05:06.930 --> 05:08.124
l got a gun.

05:09.566 --> 05:10.828
Come over here, man.

05:10.867 --> 05:12.232
What kind of gun is this?
A Toka...

05:12.268 --> 05:14.133
A gun is a gun, you know.

05:14.170 --> 05:16.297
They--they kill people.

05:16.339 --> 05:18.273
Check the barrel
and don`t point it at me.

05:18.308 --> 05:19.832
What the fuck
are you talking about?

05:19.876 --> 05:22.174
The first thing you do
when you find a gun...

05:22.212 --> 05:23.543
is to check the barrel.

05:23.580 --> 05:25.810
You fire this, you know...

05:25.849 --> 05:27.874
and the barrel`s clogged...

05:27.917 --> 05:29.578
it`ll blow up in your hand.

05:29.619 --> 05:32.713
-Don`t fuck around with that.
-What the fuck you doing?

05:32.755 --> 05:36.555
l can get twenty bucks for this
with or without bullets.

05:36.593 --> 05:38.788
Don`t wory about it.
Forget it ever came up.

05:38.828 --> 05:39.954
Food.

05:39.996 --> 05:41.623
Forget this trash here, man.

05:41.664 --> 05:44.155
l know where we can get
some real food, Hank.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.997
Yeah, l know
where some real food is.

05:46.970 --> 05:50.167
Just don`t tell me any more
of them fucking stories.

05:53.443 --> 05:56.037
You know l don`t chicken out...

05:56.079 --> 05:58.138
but l got a funny feeling
about this.

05:58.181 --> 06:00.411
Come on, Hank, you just got
to trust me, all right?

06:00.450 --> 06:03.078
l know what l`m doing.
Just stay right here.

06:03.119 --> 06:04.677
You`re a fool.

06:04.721 --> 06:06.814
They got watchdogs
all over the place.

06:06.856 --> 06:08.881
l`ve known this dog
longer than l`ve known you.

06:09.926 --> 06:11.325
You never listen to me.

06:12.996 --> 06:15.089
Hey, Hank,
what do you know about this?

06:16.566 --> 06:17.726
Come here, dog.

06:19.235 --> 06:21.260
Yeah, l told you.

06:21.304 --> 06:24.273
Hey, we got enough
for lots of folks!

06:24.307 --> 06:26.605
Well, l finally caught your ass.

06:26.643 --> 06:29.669
We`re just hungy.
Give us a break, will you?

06:29.712 --> 06:31.202
We`ll give it back!

06:31.247 --> 06:34.114
lt`s already contaminated
with your filth.

06:34.150 --> 06:35.515
Somebody`s going to pay.

06:37.587 --> 06:39.111
Leave the old man alone!

06:41.925 --> 06:43.620
Pulling a gun on me, huh?

06:45.728 --> 06:47.355
You going to hurt me?

06:47.397 --> 06:50.992
Hurt you? No, l`m not going
to hurt you at all.

06:51.034 --> 06:52.592
l`m going to kill me
somebody tonight.

06:58.808 --> 07:00.799
You`re right.
Somebody`s going to die tonight.

07:00.843 --> 07:03.368
Yeah.
lt`s going to be you...

07:03.413 --> 07:07.008
maybe all of us.
Let`s all die.

07:07.050 --> 07:09.484
You`re a crazy motherfucker.

07:09.519 --> 07:12.647
l`ll take this stick and ram it
up your ass, make a popsicle.

07:12.689 --> 07:14.657
You ain`t shit.
You like beating up old people?

07:14.691 --> 07:18.320
l can clock you in the head.
Let`s go see the devil.

07:18.361 --> 07:20.124
Would you like that?

07:20.163 --> 07:22.631
Man, get the fuck out of here!

07:22.665 --> 07:24.565
Hey, man, you crazy!

07:24.601 --> 07:26.933
And don`t come back, you hear?

07:31.541 --> 07:34.374
l handled that.
Hop the fence and get the meat.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.674
Aw, go fuck yourself.

07:39.616 --> 07:40.947
Aw, shit.

08:10.947 --> 08:13.347
We want to thank you, mister.

08:13.383 --> 08:15.112
Want help with the fire?

08:15.151 --> 08:16.311
No, that`s all right.

08:20.990 --> 08:22.184
l say something wrong?

08:23.226 --> 08:24.386
lt ain`t your fault.

08:30.767 --> 08:34.134
Now, look, what`s done is done.

08:34.169 --> 08:36.501
Blaming yourself for
what happened two years ago...

08:36.539 --> 08:38.200
won`t change a damn thing.

08:38.241 --> 08:40.402
-Finished?
-No, just starting.

08:40.443 --> 08:44.004
l`m going to get you
on your feet again.

08:44.047 --> 08:47.744
Ain`t nobody ever going to give
a break to nobody like me.

08:47.784 --> 08:51.311
Fuck `em all,
and give yourself one, too.

08:51.354 --> 08:54.187
lt`s up to you to get your life
back on track again...

08:54.223 --> 08:55.747
not nobody else.

08:55.792 --> 08:58.659
No matter what l do, somebody`s
going to knock me down.

08:58.695 --> 09:02.096
Don`t let `em. Once you get
your confidence back...

09:02.131 --> 09:04.622
you fight them
with eveything you got...

09:04.667 --> 09:07.135
to hold on with.
l mean eveything.

09:07.170 --> 09:10.401
You got all this philosophy.
What happened to you?

09:10.440 --> 09:12.567
Aw, shit.

09:12.608 --> 09:15.634
Last time l was on track...

09:15.678 --> 09:17.737
l was still a virgin.

09:17.780 --> 09:21.341
All this food seems to be going
to your head.

09:21.384 --> 09:23.181
You getting sentimental, man.

09:58.721 --> 10:01.349
God`s still constipated.

10:06.729 --> 10:07.889
Get up, Hank.

10:11.334 --> 10:12.699
Shit.

10:12.735 --> 10:14.464
Another fucked-up day.

10:19.142 --> 10:20.404
Get up, Hank!

10:30.520 --> 10:32.613
Oh, man.

10:32.655 --> 10:34.919
You can`t die on me, Hank.

11:05.755 --> 11:08.815
l`ll take one of those bags.

11:08.858 --> 11:10.223
Oh, there`s my buddy, huh?

11:10.259 --> 11:11.726
When did you get out of jail?

11:12.929 --> 11:15.420
Here. God bless you.
You take care of yourself.

11:18.668 --> 11:20.465
Hey, hey, hey!
Don`t you want a free lunch?

11:20.503 --> 11:21.970
No such thing.

11:22.004 --> 11:23.767
Hey, wait!

11:23.806 --> 11:25.637
l only want to help you.

12:09.051 --> 12:10.211
Oh, shit.

12:14.190 --> 12:15.714
What`s wrong with you, man?
Get up!

12:19.095 --> 12:21.290
-Hey, get the fuck off me!
-l`m tying to help you.

12:21.330 --> 12:24.424
-l don`t want your help!
-Don`t kill yourself!

12:24.467 --> 12:27.402
-l`ve been through rough times.
-Like what, your Jacuzzi broke?

12:27.436 --> 12:30.098
-There`s always another way out.
-Like what?

12:30.139 --> 12:31.697
Like letting someone help you.

12:31.741 --> 12:33.436
Why the fuck
would you want to help me?

12:33.476 --> 12:36.502
Because life
has been good to me.

12:36.545 --> 12:38.012
l saw you and thought...

12:38.047 --> 12:41.676
it`s a chance for me
to make a difference to someone.

12:41.717 --> 12:44.584
Why don`t you save that shit
for somebody who gives a fuck?

12:46.255 --> 12:49.053
Look, man, you`re young,
you know? You`re healthy.

12:49.091 --> 12:50.718
You seem intelligent.

12:50.760 --> 12:51.886
Why would you want
to kill yourself?

12:51.928 --> 12:55.227
Maybe l like choosing
when l die.

12:55.264 --> 12:57.425
Don`t you have family,
people who care?

12:57.466 --> 13:00.264
l had a wife and a kid,
and they`re dead.

13:00.303 --> 13:02.965
-lsn`t there anyone else?
-No!

13:03.005 --> 13:04.905
l find that hard to believe!

13:04.941 --> 13:08.206
l don`t want anybody
to care about me.

13:08.244 --> 13:10.678
l don`t want to be responsible
for anybody else`s feelings.

13:10.713 --> 13:12.374
l`m through with this shit.

13:13.950 --> 13:16.145
Hey, let me ask you something!

13:16.185 --> 13:18.176
lf someone offered you
a good job...

13:18.220 --> 13:20.688
something that would be
a real opportunity...

13:20.723 --> 13:21.883
would you be interested?

13:26.562 --> 13:28.655
OK.

13:28.698 --> 13:30.791
Well, if you ever want
to look me up...

13:30.833 --> 13:34.064
l`m at the Seventh Street
Mission evey Thursday.

13:37.907 --> 13:39.067
Yo, hold up, man.

13:40.076 --> 13:41.737
What kind of job
are you talking about?

13:43.245 --> 13:44.837
My business partner and l...

13:44.880 --> 13:48.077
need someone to help us
as a survival guide...

13:48.117 --> 13:50.244
with our hunts
in the wilderness.

13:50.286 --> 13:52.049
l don`t know shit about that.

13:52.088 --> 13:53.248
With my recommendation...

13:53.289 --> 13:56.452
you`ll have a decent chance
of getting the job.

13:56.492 --> 13:58.722
-The pay is good.
-What kind of pay?

13:58.761 --> 14:00.422
How much money exactly, man?

14:00.463 --> 14:02.294
Just go down there.

14:02.331 --> 14:04.492
Talk to this man.

14:04.533 --> 14:06.296
His name`s Burns.

14:06.335 --> 14:08.565
You`ll find out eveything
you need to know.

15:06.462 --> 15:07.759
Can l help you?

15:08.798 --> 15:09.958
Mason.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.263
My partner.

15:13.302 --> 15:14.667
He`s such a...

15:14.703 --> 15:16.728
humanitarian.

15:16.772 --> 15:18.103
Why don`t you come in, please?

15:31.720 --> 15:32.880
Sit down.

15:45.234 --> 15:46.462
No offense, but...

15:48.337 --> 15:50.897
you don`t look like
much of a hunter to me.

15:53.142 --> 15:56.236
l was just getting ready to say
the same thing about you.

15:56.278 --> 15:57.768
l`ve already got the job.

16:12.027 --> 16:14.894
How many cigarettes
do you smoke in a day?

16:14.930 --> 16:17.023
As many as l can get.

16:18.134 --> 16:19.533
l appreciate you coming in...

16:20.569 --> 16:23.629
but the job needs someone
with, uh...

16:23.672 --> 16:24.934
endurance.

16:26.509 --> 16:28.773
l`m afraid your lungs
couldn`t handle it.

16:28.811 --> 16:31.041
That`s it?

16:31.080 --> 16:32.604
Just that quick?

16:32.648 --> 16:36.675
Come on, man, l need this job.
l got endurance.

16:36.719 --> 16:39.119
That`s one of those running
things over there, right?

16:39.155 --> 16:41.248
Turn that on.
Put me on it.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.917
l`ll show you some endurance.

16:46.896 --> 16:49.990
Keep this up for half an hour,
l`ll give you twenty bucks.

16:53.469 --> 16:56.199
For twenty bucks,
l`ll run to fucking Alaska.

17:23.065 --> 17:24.362
Never thought you`d make it.

17:26.035 --> 17:29.471
Never underestimate a man
who ain`t got nothing to lose.

17:29.505 --> 17:31.473
Evey man`s
got something to lose.

17:33.142 --> 17:34.973
Look, just `cause
you got a lot of money...

17:35.010 --> 17:36.944
don`t think you know evey man.

17:39.281 --> 17:42.182
So, how do l get ahold of you
if l need you?

17:44.386 --> 17:46.286
Best hotel in town.

17:50.059 --> 17:52.084
Man, twenty-five years ago...

17:52.127 --> 17:54.493
l married this woman,
this black woman--

17:54.530 --> 17:58.523
voluptuous, pretty,
hair slick on her head.

17:58.567 --> 18:02.298
Six months later,
all that shit was null and void.

18:02.338 --> 18:03.498
l`d get home.

18:03.539 --> 18:05.166
Son would say, ""Get out of bed.""

18:05.207 --> 18:07.175
l get on out the bed--

18:07.209 --> 18:08.767
Boy, who you done robbed?

18:08.811 --> 18:12.212
Just give me a room--one
with a TV that works this time.

18:12.248 --> 18:14.375
You must want
the presidential suite.

18:14.416 --> 18:16.077
l just want what l pay for.

18:21.557 --> 18:25.220
Hey, before you get in that bed,
you wash your nasty ass, boy!

18:25.261 --> 18:27.320
You make sure you wash
your nasty ass!

18:30.099 --> 18:32.158
l get to the kitchen, right?

18:32.201 --> 18:34.169
Mr. Overland
goes to the kitchen...

18:34.203 --> 18:36.068
bitch right behind him.

18:37.439 --> 18:38.599
Son of a bitch.

20:09.264 --> 20:11.732
Go away. l got the room
till twelve o`clock.

20:13.035 --> 20:14.696
l thought you wanted a job.

20:26.982 --> 20:28.506
You cut your hair.

20:28.550 --> 20:29.949
l like to stay in style.

20:31.387 --> 20:32.684
How`d you get the burns?

20:32.721 --> 20:35.121
Playing with matches, all right?

20:35.157 --> 20:36.556
No shit?

20:40.129 --> 20:43.030
l got you some clothes.
They should pretty much fit you.

20:44.233 --> 20:46.758
How in the fuck
would you know what fit me?

20:46.802 --> 20:48.099
Trust me. l`ve been doing this
a long time.

20:48.137 --> 20:52.699
l ain`t doing nothing
unless the money`s right.

20:55.611 --> 20:59.274
We`ll give you a couple of days
to get into the hang of things.

21:00.149 --> 21:02.549
Food and lodging,
we`ll take care of it.

21:02.584 --> 21:04.677
We`ll start you off
on five hundred dollars a week.

21:05.954 --> 21:07.888
Here`s a two-hundred-dollar
advance.

21:10.025 --> 21:11.720
lt`s money.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.159
lf you do well...

21:13.195 --> 21:15.356
we may give you a raise.

21:16.765 --> 21:18.494
l`ll be outside.

21:22.438 --> 21:26.169
l spent quite some time
in third world countries.

21:27.142 --> 21:29.167
lt changed my point of view.

21:29.211 --> 21:31.304
lt`s a clichÈ to say
that life was cheap there...

21:31.346 --> 21:34.008
but life was way beyond cheap.

21:34.049 --> 21:38.247
l`m glad l got this job,
but l don`t understand...

21:38.287 --> 21:40.551
what it is about hunting animals
that gets you off.

21:40.589 --> 21:42.079
lt`s not about killing.

21:42.825 --> 21:45.020
lt`s not about death.

21:45.060 --> 21:47.028
lt`s about life.

21:47.062 --> 21:48.996
You tell that to the animal.

21:49.031 --> 21:50.191
The animal knows it, too.

21:50.232 --> 21:55.169
This is going to be quite
a learning experience for you.

21:55.204 --> 21:56.501
Whatever, man, whatever.

21:56.538 --> 21:59.666
As long as l`m getting paid,
l could give a fuck.

21:59.708 --> 22:02.700
Where is Hell`s Canyon, anyway?

22:24.066 --> 22:25.363
Where are we at right now?

22:26.435 --> 22:28.232
We just crossed
the Oregon border.

22:47.890 --> 22:49.448
This is some remote shit, man.

22:49.491 --> 22:51.550
This is way out
in the fucking boondocks.

22:51.593 --> 22:53.925
Yeah, but it`s beautiful.

22:53.962 --> 22:55.589
lt`s just the way we like it.

22:55.631 --> 22:57.997
lt has great hunting, too.

22:58.033 --> 23:00.126
Why hunt a pig, though?

23:00.168 --> 23:02.227
This doesn`t look like something
you`d want to kill.

23:02.271 --> 23:04.603
We`re not hunting Frank.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.631
He`s our special guest.

23:39.975 --> 23:41.602
Propane goes into the cabin.

23:43.412 --> 23:45.812
Bring some beer from the fridge
while you`re in there.

23:46.982 --> 23:48.108
All right.

23:48.150 --> 23:50.641
OK, Frank,
let`s get out of here.

23:51.420 --> 23:53.251
Good. Good, good.

23:54.957 --> 23:57.391
Watch it.
He`s pretty nasty.

24:01.129 --> 24:02.494
Wait till he gets here.

24:04.066 --> 24:05.226
Come on, Frank!

24:31.193 --> 24:32.922
Shit.

24:32.961 --> 24:34.485
Goddamn.

24:39.534 --> 24:41.468
Shit, l wonder what`s in there.

24:46.208 --> 24:47.368
Beer.

25:03.125 --> 25:05.685
Well, Mr. Burns.

25:05.727 --> 25:07.217
-Hello, Doc.
-Nice to be here.

25:07.262 --> 25:09.457
-Doc Hawkins.
-Good to see you.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.126
This is my son Derrick.

25:13.168 --> 25:14.328
This your first hunt?

25:14.369 --> 25:16.269
l`ve been hunting
since l was twelve.

25:16.304 --> 25:18.397
Not like this one, he hasn`t.

25:19.374 --> 25:22.036
Meet Griffin, the oil man
l was telling you about.

25:22.077 --> 25:23.237
Glad you could make it.

25:25.147 --> 25:26.409
You sure about this one?

25:26.448 --> 25:28.143
-l`m sure.
-Has he got courage?

25:29.551 --> 25:31.610
Gentlemen,
l would like you to meet...

25:31.653 --> 25:33.814
our new hunting guide Mason.

25:34.723 --> 25:37.920
Mason,
this is Mr. Wolfe, Senior...

25:37.959 --> 25:40.257
one of the most feared men
on Wall Street.

25:40.295 --> 25:43.128
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-lt`s a pleasure to meet you.

25:43.165 --> 25:45.463
-His son, Wolfe, Junior.
-How you doing, Junior?

25:45.500 --> 25:47.161
Derrick.

25:47.202 --> 25:49.466
And Dr. Hawkins.

25:49.504 --> 25:50.698
How you doing, Mr. Hawkins?

25:50.739 --> 25:51.933
You know where you`re going?

25:51.973 --> 25:54.032
-Nice watch.
-Thank you.

25:54.076 --> 25:55.873
This is Griffin.

25:55.911 --> 25:57.208
Nice to meet you, Mr. Griffin.

25:59.414 --> 26:02.406
Gentlemen,
l hope you all brought your...

26:03.452 --> 26:05.443
appetites.

26:05.487 --> 26:06.920
What are we having, a pachyderm?

26:06.955 --> 26:08.115
Right this way.

26:10.125 --> 26:11.251
Big pig.

26:11.293 --> 26:12.590
Oh, man.

26:12.627 --> 26:13.889
lt`s a good thing
you didn`t eat on the plane.

26:13.929 --> 26:15.260
Outstanding.

26:17.132 --> 26:18.360
-All right.
-My God.

26:19.334 --> 26:20.892
Gentlemen...

26:20.936 --> 26:22.563
l`d like to propose a toast...

26:23.505 --> 26:26.406
to Doc Hawkins...

26:26.441 --> 26:28.432
who provided us
with the initial inspiration...

26:28.477 --> 26:30.172
for these hunts of ours.

26:30.212 --> 26:31.679
Thank you, Mr. Burns.

26:31.713 --> 26:33.442
Each man out here...

26:34.282 --> 26:36.750
will experience
the animal within himself...

26:37.819 --> 26:38.979
so embrace it.

26:39.921 --> 26:41.912
Don`t deny it.

26:41.957 --> 26:44.050
Allow yourself to feel
the purity...

26:44.092 --> 26:46.322
of your primal essence.

26:46.361 --> 26:47.828
lt`s God`s gift to man.

26:47.863 --> 26:50.058
Here`s a toast to the hunters...

26:50.932 --> 26:52.957
and a prayer for the hunted.

26:53.001 --> 26:54.161
-Amen.
-Amen.

26:55.670 --> 26:57.228
Well done.

26:57.272 --> 26:58.637
-All right.
-Let`s eat.

26:58.673 --> 26:59.901
Drink and be mery.

27:01.710 --> 27:03.871
Would you pass me the carrots?

27:03.912 --> 27:05.072
Carrots coming up.

27:06.515 --> 27:07.675
Air mail.

27:08.650 --> 27:10.914
You don`t really look
like a doctor to me.

27:10.952 --> 27:12.681
l`m a psychiatrist.

27:12.721 --> 27:15.986
-A shrink?
-Does that surprise you?

27:16.024 --> 27:17.514
You don`t look like
the kind of person...

27:17.559 --> 27:19.652
fucked-up rich people
give money to...

27:19.694 --> 27:21.355
to tell all their personal shit.

27:22.697 --> 27:24.164
l work for the company.

27:24.199 --> 27:25.666
That`s the ClA.

27:26.468 --> 27:29.801
l know these two gentlemen`s
personal shit completely.

27:29.838 --> 27:32.136
Yeah, Doc thought, uh...

27:32.174 --> 27:34.870
hunting would be good therapy
for us when we retired.

27:35.677 --> 27:37.110
Let me get this straight.

27:37.145 --> 27:40.080
You kill animals,
and that`s therapy?

27:40.115 --> 27:42.948
-lt works.
-Hey, it works for me.

27:42.984 --> 27:45.578
That`s the stupidest shit
l ever heard...

27:45.620 --> 27:46.951
but it`s cool.
lt`s your thing.

27:46.988 --> 27:49.513
Take your time.
Enjoy yourselves.

27:49.558 --> 27:50.752
l am.

27:50.792 --> 27:54.091
Life`s true pleasures
are so unpredictable.

27:54.129 --> 27:56.393
l say, cherish the moment...

27:57.732 --> 27:59.666
for what it is.

27:59.701 --> 28:00.895
Observe your food...

28:02.103 --> 28:03.900
smell it...

28:03.939 --> 28:05.099
touch it...

28:06.341 --> 28:08.172
put your mind into it...

28:08.210 --> 28:09.768
and then when
you`re finally ready...

28:11.246 --> 28:13.146
consume it...slowly.

28:15.450 --> 28:17.714
You do it your way,
l`ll do it mine.

28:17.752 --> 28:19.014
How in the hell...

28:19.054 --> 28:22.581
did you become
such a ter-fucking-rific chef?

28:22.624 --> 28:25.923
We don`t believe
in the average processed food.

28:25.961 --> 28:28.452
We hand-pick carefully.

28:28.496 --> 28:30.487
Cole`s the real expert.

28:31.199 --> 28:32.894
There`s a poem.

28:32.934 --> 28:34.060
Yeats wrote it.

28:34.102 --> 28:38.903
Could you tell that this meat
would be this glorious...

28:38.940 --> 28:40.168
while the boar
was still breathing?

28:40.208 --> 28:42.176
l was pretty sure about it.

28:42.210 --> 28:43.609
Well done.

28:44.379 --> 28:45.903
How could you tell?

28:45.947 --> 28:48.245
Well, it takes
some experience, but...

28:49.517 --> 28:50.677
you learn what to look for.

28:52.888 --> 28:54.048
You consider the, uh...

28:54.956 --> 28:56.856
the animal`s age...

28:56.892 --> 28:58.291
what condition it`s in...

28:59.294 --> 29:00.784
its hair...

29:00.829 --> 29:01.989
lts musculature...

29:03.064 --> 29:04.326
how it was raised.

29:04.366 --> 29:06.061
You can pretty much tell.

29:09.504 --> 29:11.131
What do you think?

29:11.172 --> 29:13.299
lt`s all right.
l like this.

29:13.341 --> 29:14.740
Four-fifty a bottle.

29:16.211 --> 29:19.146
$4.50? l should`ve been drinking
this shit a long time ago.

29:19.180 --> 29:20.704
Four hundred and fifty dollars.

29:21.850 --> 29:23.010
Don`t waste it.

29:24.653 --> 29:27.019
l could live off that
for three months.

29:27.055 --> 29:30.320
Well, you don`t want to drink
too much, anyway...

29:30.358 --> 29:32.189
`cause you don`t want
to be slow tomorrow.

29:33.962 --> 29:35.156
No, indeed.

29:36.531 --> 29:38.658
You`re missing the best part,
Mr. Mason.

29:39.901 --> 29:41.994
When you`re eating the flesh
from the pig...

29:42.804 --> 29:43.998
look into his little beady eyes.

29:44.039 --> 29:47.998
That way,
you will be devouring his soul.

29:50.178 --> 29:52.874
Sometimes you even scare me.

29:52.914 --> 29:54.074
Good.

30:03.358 --> 30:04.655
Have a cigar, kid.

30:06.194 --> 30:07.456
l want you to tell me...

30:08.296 --> 30:09.456
where this came from.

30:11.599 --> 30:12.725
Are you ready?

30:12.767 --> 30:15.167
Hey, can l bum a cigarette
off you?

30:17.072 --> 30:18.198
Take the whole pack.

30:18.239 --> 30:19.900
l just want one.

30:19.941 --> 30:21.670
l`m offering you
more than just one.

30:21.710 --> 30:23.007
l only want one.

30:23.044 --> 30:25.444
Well, then the rest
are going to go to waste.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.038
Look here.

30:36.925 --> 30:38.517
lf you got something
to say to me, just say it.

30:38.560 --> 30:39.891
Where you from?

30:39.928 --> 30:41.088
All over.

30:41.896 --> 30:43.022
How old are you?

30:43.064 --> 30:46.124
Thirty-two. lf you want to know
my pants size, ask him.

30:46.167 --> 30:48.761
Come on, Mason. He`s only tying
to get to know you.

30:48.803 --> 30:51.203
l don`t like people
getting in my personal shit.

30:51.239 --> 30:53.332
He`s been looking at me all day.

30:53.375 --> 30:56.640
Mr. Mason,
have you ever killed anything?

30:57.579 --> 30:59.809
-What?
-My wife and kids.

31:01.116 --> 31:02.708
-You sack of shit!
-John! John!

31:02.751 --> 31:04.184
-You son of a bitch.
-Take it outside.

31:04.219 --> 31:07.882
You`re fucking mine tomorrow,
you sack of shit!

31:08.957 --> 31:10.549
What`s up with that dude?

31:10.592 --> 31:13.220
He lost his daughter
a couple of months ago.

31:16.297 --> 31:17.889
You didn`t kill your family,
did you?

31:22.370 --> 31:24.065
How did that make you feel?

31:24.105 --> 31:27.268
l came in my fucking pants.

31:32.247 --> 31:35.182
l know more about you
than you think, Mason.

31:36.885 --> 31:38.011
You probably do...

31:38.053 --> 31:40.419
but l don`t know shit about you.

31:40.455 --> 31:43.447
Ask me anything you want.

31:43.491 --> 31:46.892
How`d you get that
fucked-up scar under your eye?

31:50.398 --> 31:52.127
l refer to that as my birthmark.

31:52.167 --> 31:55.466
On my eighth birthday, my father
brought me a bulldog--

31:55.503 --> 31:57.471
a fat little bulldog.

31:57.505 --> 31:59.905
l named him Prince Heny Stout.

31:59.941 --> 32:01.533
He was strong.

32:01.576 --> 32:02.975
He would chase my pet turkey.

32:03.011 --> 32:05.479
He would chase squirrels
up the tree.

32:05.513 --> 32:07.481
l trained him, raised him...

32:07.515 --> 32:09.415
fed him, groomed him.

32:09.451 --> 32:10.816
l loved that dog.

32:11.953 --> 32:13.978
More than anything in the world,
l loved that dog.

32:15.056 --> 32:17.616
My father gave me a handful
of chery bombs and M-80s...

32:17.659 --> 32:20.526
and said, ""You`re gonna train
this dog to be a protector.""

32:20.562 --> 32:24.157
So l got behind
a little dummy my dad built...

32:24.199 --> 32:27.168
and l tossed these chery bombs
and M-80s at the dog.

32:28.503 --> 32:32.064
After a while, he`d get angy
and come at the dummy.

32:33.341 --> 32:34.865
He`d rip it apart.

32:34.909 --> 32:36.774
Head was off.
Shirt was gone.

32:39.948 --> 32:41.210
So, thirteen years old,
birthday time.

32:41.249 --> 32:43.809
Got me a twelve-gauge shotgun.

32:43.852 --> 32:45.342
We`re goin` huntin`.

32:45.386 --> 32:46.683
l was so excited.

32:47.689 --> 32:48.917
We went out in the clearing
in the woods.

32:48.957 --> 32:51.517
My dad laid our guns down
and said...

32:51.559 --> 32:53.993
""Son, today you`re going to
learn to control your emotions.""

32:55.830 --> 32:58.765
""You`re going to do things
some men are unwilling to do.""

33:00.001 --> 33:01.434
`"Follow me.""

33:01.469 --> 33:05.030
We went around a clump of trees.
There`s a little corral.

33:05.073 --> 33:06.301
There`s Prince Heny Stout...

33:06.341 --> 33:08.036
chained
in the middle of the corral.

33:09.210 --> 33:11.144
My dad took out a pocketful
of chery bombs...

33:11.179 --> 33:13.079
put `em in my hand, and said,
""Get in the corral.

33:13.114 --> 33:16.914
""Light those chery bombs
and throw `em at the Prince.""

33:17.952 --> 33:19.283
`"You`re gonna face manhood.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.481
You`re gonna fight that dog
to the death.""

33:22.524 --> 33:24.924
""He`s gonna kill you,
or you`re gonna kill him.""

33:26.995 --> 33:28.155
`"Now!""

33:35.703 --> 33:37.000
He was on me.

33:37.038 --> 33:38.903
He was on me like flies on shit.

33:40.608 --> 33:42.542
l had no chance.

33:42.577 --> 33:45.375
l got my arm up
between his teeth and my neck.

33:45.413 --> 33:47.779
Went down in the mud,
rolled over.

33:47.815 --> 33:50.409
That dog
is fightin` and bitin`...

33:50.451 --> 33:52.715
and l`m screamin` and cyin`,
grabbin` him around the head.

33:52.754 --> 33:55.951
l stand up and fall
with my weight on him...

33:58.726 --> 33:59.886
hear his neck break.

34:01.796 --> 34:02.956
He`s dead.

34:04.532 --> 34:06.295
He`s not breathin`.

34:06.334 --> 34:09.393
He`s not...yelpin`,
he`s not bitin`...

34:09.437 --> 34:10.960
and l`m covered with blood.

34:12.907 --> 34:15.068
l stand up.
l wipe the blood off.

34:17.312 --> 34:19.007
l lick it.

34:19.047 --> 34:21.072
My dad says,
`"Welcome to manhood.""

34:25.286 --> 34:27.254
That`s why this is a birthmark.

34:33.795 --> 34:37.356
Do your patients
know about this stoy?

34:37.398 --> 34:40.697
No, but you do.

34:52.380 --> 34:54.348
Turkey?

34:54.382 --> 34:56.543
-Good work, Derrick.
-Here`s to the turkeys, Mason.

35:05.026 --> 35:06.186
Well...

35:08.229 --> 35:09.423
this is your room.

35:13.568 --> 35:15.399
Mr. Burns,
l really want to thank you.

35:16.237 --> 35:18.000
l know.

35:18.039 --> 35:19.836
l`ll tell you
about the job tomorrow.

35:19.874 --> 35:21.034
Good night.

35:35.757 --> 35:36.917
Well, Hank...

35:38.059 --> 35:39.219
l`m on my feet.

36:32.613 --> 36:34.410
Once upon a time...

36:34.449 --> 36:36.314
there were six little hunters.

36:37.318 --> 36:39.343
Rise and shine, Mason.

36:41.723 --> 36:43.782
Yo, what the fuck`s up, Cole?

36:44.625 --> 36:46.650
Get up.
Put your shit on.

36:46.694 --> 36:47.820
This ain`t funny!

36:47.862 --> 36:50.831
Shut the fuck up
and put that shit on!

36:51.699 --> 36:53.564
We`d like to play a game.

36:55.536 --> 36:56.696
lt`s vey simple.

36:57.972 --> 37:00.406
You see, the hunt begins now.

37:01.275 --> 37:03.300
We`re the hunters...

37:03.344 --> 37:04.504
and you`re the hunted.

37:05.380 --> 37:06.608
You leave here now...

37:06.647 --> 37:09.673
with a head start
of as long as it takes us...

37:09.717 --> 37:13.744
to eat
a nice, leisurely breakfast.

37:13.788 --> 37:17.383
lf you make it
to civilization, you live.

37:17.425 --> 37:19.120
lf you don`t...

37:19.160 --> 37:21.185
maybe God will have mercy.

37:27.168 --> 37:28.328
Bitch!

37:31.139 --> 37:33.232
-Here he is.
-Let the games begin.

37:34.375 --> 37:36.240
You son of a bitch...

37:36.277 --> 37:38.677
l want you so bad,
l can taste it.

37:39.414 --> 37:40.847
Let me get the door.

37:40.882 --> 37:42.349
Let me get the door for you.

37:43.384 --> 37:44.715
Get out!

37:44.752 --> 37:46.242
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

37:47.989 --> 37:49.513
Get out of here,
you stinking motherfucker.

37:52.860 --> 37:54.452
Run.

37:54.495 --> 37:55.928
Yo, Burns, what the fuck?

37:58.032 --> 37:59.465
He`s going to chase his nuts.

38:03.704 --> 38:05.137
Pace yourself!

38:05.873 --> 38:08.865
l enjoy fucking with them.
Don`t you?

38:08.910 --> 38:12.676
What excites me is breaking
his neck with my bare hands.

38:12.713 --> 38:16.046
That`s fine, doctor,
but l assure you...

38:16.083 --> 38:18.779
l intend to shoot that
son of a bitch myself first.

38:18.820 --> 38:20.981
He better last long enough
to make it a challenge.

38:21.022 --> 38:23.354
Trust me, he will.

38:23.391 --> 38:24.881
Wait a second, Dad.

38:24.926 --> 38:26.257
We won`t hunt him, will we?

38:26.294 --> 38:27.852
Keep your voice down.

38:27.895 --> 38:30.056
No, no, no.
He`s a human being.

38:31.165 --> 38:33.030
He`s a homeless piece of shit.
He`s nothing.

38:33.067 --> 38:34.295
He`s less than nothing.

38:34.335 --> 38:36.701
Fuck that.
l won`t take any part in this.

38:42.877 --> 38:44.105
You`re too much
like your mother.

38:45.513 --> 38:48.949
l brought you out here to learn
something about yourself.

38:48.983 --> 38:51.975
l spent fifty thousand dollars
for you to learn a lesson...

38:53.254 --> 38:55.381
to develop an instinct
you don`t have...

38:56.524 --> 38:58.515
and l`ll be damned
if you`re not going to learn it.

39:02.964 --> 39:04.431
Don`t disappoint me, Derrick.

39:06.133 --> 39:07.361
Now, come on.

39:07.401 --> 39:08.663
Let`s have some breakfast.

39:27.822 --> 39:29.949
You know, the only thing
l miss up here...

39:31.859 --> 39:33.156
is the sports page.

39:35.530 --> 39:38.499
l`m so used to getting up...

39:38.533 --> 39:40.660
having my morning coffee...

39:40.701 --> 39:43.499
and opening up the sports page.

39:46.040 --> 39:48.031
l don`t read newspapers anymore.

39:49.243 --> 39:52.542
They`re like the mirror
of the world`s ugliness.

39:52.580 --> 39:54.241
l like beautiful things.

39:55.683 --> 39:57.913
-l`m ready to go.
-Relax, Doc.

39:57.952 --> 39:59.146
Digest your food.

39:59.186 --> 40:00.153
We`re wasting time.

40:00.187 --> 40:01.552
Give him more time.

40:03.124 --> 40:04.318
Think of it as foreplay.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.923
Never mind foreplay.
l`m talking about--

40:08.863 --> 40:11.855
Prince Heny Stout.
Remember the rules.

40:16.003 --> 40:17.994
l feel something special
about this.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.337
lt`s going to be
so much more special...

40:20.374 --> 40:21.841
when you finally nail him.

40:31.052 --> 40:33.020
Eat some eggs.
You`ll feel better.

40:33.054 --> 40:34.316
Eat. Eat.

40:35.690 --> 40:37.317
l`m not hungy.

40:37.358 --> 40:38.723
l beg your pardon?

40:38.759 --> 40:40.420
l said l`m not hungy.

40:40.461 --> 40:42.554
Oh. Terrific.

40:43.564 --> 40:44.690
l`ll tell you what--

40:44.732 --> 40:46.199
l`ll pull a switcheroonie here.

40:47.568 --> 40:49.763
l hope this is not going to be
a problem.

40:51.539 --> 40:52.699
lt won`t be.

40:56.811 --> 40:58.142
You`ll be OK.

41:02.350 --> 41:03.510
Dad, l can`t do this.

41:04.785 --> 41:05.945
Yes, you can.

41:12.593 --> 41:15.061
A thousand dollars
says my son`ll draw first blood.

41:15.096 --> 41:17.690
One, two, three.

41:17.732 --> 41:19.791
You made yourself
three thousand dollars, Derrick.

41:32.046 --> 41:34.014
Damn, l wish
l`d never started smoking.

41:37.351 --> 41:39.046
All right.

41:39.086 --> 41:40.451
Let`s get the turkey.

41:54.935 --> 41:58.166
You believe it? They always
start out the same way.

42:02.276 --> 42:03.436
Shit.

42:10.418 --> 42:12.579
God, what a beautiful day!

42:18.059 --> 42:19.458
Don`t you see his tracks?

42:19.493 --> 42:22.360
Stevie Wonder
could follow these tracks.

42:33.874 --> 42:36.172
You`re mine, Mason!

42:36.210 --> 42:38.610
l want you!

42:39.714 --> 42:40.840
Oh, God.

42:40.881 --> 42:42.815
l got something.

42:42.850 --> 42:44.579
l see something.

42:44.618 --> 42:45.846
Give me a bearing.

42:45.886 --> 42:47.251
Right up here.

42:47.288 --> 42:48.687
Two o`clock.
Three o`clock.

42:48.723 --> 42:50.623
That`s a mule deer, Griffin.

42:53.661 --> 42:55.754
Listen, you jackass.

42:55.796 --> 42:58.993
lf l tell you l see something,
you can piss on a fire--

42:59.033 --> 43:02.992
Mr. Griffin, why don`t you
stop talking about it...

43:03.037 --> 43:04.629
and show us where it is?

43:04.672 --> 43:06.264
Well, all right.

43:06.307 --> 43:07.740
All right.
Over here.

43:27.428 --> 43:28.588
l don`t see anything.

43:39.373 --> 43:40.533
Come on!

43:52.653 --> 43:54.518
What are you doing?

43:54.555 --> 43:56.284
Griffin, there`s no one there.

44:00.895 --> 44:02.624
Think.

44:05.933 --> 44:07.059
l saw him.

44:07.101 --> 44:08.432
l fucking saw him !

44:11.005 --> 44:12.165
Well...

44:14.975 --> 44:17.341
l saw Mason.
l just saw Mason.

44:17.378 --> 44:19.744
He just shot and killed
four trees.

44:19.780 --> 44:20.940
Let`s go take a look.

44:20.981 --> 44:23.040
You laid them out.
They`re dead.

44:23.083 --> 44:24.243
No one`s there.

44:30.324 --> 44:31.484
Think.

44:58.419 --> 45:00.614
Guns.
There`s got to be some guns.

45:02.690 --> 45:04.021
There`s got to be guns.

45:12.333 --> 45:13.595
You know what l`m thinking?

45:16.036 --> 45:19.267
None of them
has ever done that before.

45:19.306 --> 45:20.466
Done what?

45:21.475 --> 45:22.942
l think he`s gone back
to the cabin.

45:22.977 --> 45:24.342
He`s figured something out.

45:24.378 --> 45:25.538
Let`s go.

45:36.957 --> 45:38.117
Guns.

45:55.109 --> 45:57.270
Them sick motherfuckers.

46:19.266 --> 46:21.257
ClA bullshit.

46:21.302 --> 46:23.327
My motherfucking ass.

46:23.370 --> 46:25.804
l`ll show you motherfuckers
therapy.

46:35.649 --> 46:36.809
Shit.

46:45.592 --> 46:46.820
l`ll look over here.

46:48.028 --> 46:50.087
Five thousand, he`s upstairs.

46:50.130 --> 46:52.291
l`m coming for you, Mason.

46:52.333 --> 46:53.698
Here l come, Mason.

46:56.971 --> 46:58.404
Get ready, Mason.

46:58.439 --> 46:59.838
What`s that smell?

47:00.574 --> 47:02.769
-Oh, no. He set us up.
-Eveybody out!

47:05.479 --> 47:07.447
Wolfe, get out!

47:08.749 --> 47:11.047
God damn it!
Derrick, run!

47:14.254 --> 47:15.949
We`re going bare hands.

47:19.460 --> 47:21.291
l`m sending you back
to your wife and kid...

47:21.328 --> 47:23.193
you piece of dog shit.

47:28.635 --> 47:30.603
Get me the fuck out of here!

47:32.573 --> 47:33.733
Help!

47:40.914 --> 47:42.711
What a punt.

47:42.750 --> 47:44.547
Dad, do you read me?

47:47.688 --> 47:48.848
Get back here!

47:50.057 --> 47:51.319
Dad, where are you?

47:53.260 --> 47:54.921
Dad, l`m coming!

47:55.829 --> 47:57.421
Dad, come on.

47:58.632 --> 48:00.429
Dad, put your arms around me.

48:00.467 --> 48:01.661
Come on!
Let`s go!

48:04.004 --> 48:05.164
Having fun yet?

48:06.707 --> 48:07.935
Come on, Mason.

48:07.975 --> 48:09.602
Get up.

48:21.221 --> 48:22.916
Let`s get him out!

48:22.956 --> 48:24.981
Help me get him out!

48:25.025 --> 48:26.185
Give me your hand.

48:34.234 --> 48:35.826
Come on.

48:35.869 --> 48:37.029
Where`s Mason?

48:39.706 --> 48:40.866
Come here.

48:43.477 --> 48:45.035
l like my meat rare.

48:54.088 --> 48:55.578
Ty well-done, bitch.

49:10.571 --> 49:12.971
Derrick,
hury up with that water.

49:20.214 --> 49:21.579
l found this.

49:21.615 --> 49:23.674
No sign of Hawkins.

49:24.485 --> 49:26.350
-What happened to Hawkins?
-He`s histoy.

49:28.255 --> 49:29.415
Oh, my God.

49:31.992 --> 49:33.425
You`re not still
going to hunt him, are you?

49:34.761 --> 49:35.921
The hell we`re not.

49:37.764 --> 49:39.698
Hasn`t this shit
gone far enough?

49:40.734 --> 49:42.463
This is where
it gets interesting.

49:42.503 --> 49:44.130
He must have been
out here somewhere.

49:44.171 --> 49:45.399
You didn`t see him, did you?

49:50.344 --> 49:52.471
Answer the man, Derrick.

49:53.647 --> 49:54.944
Look...

49:54.982 --> 49:58.850
you just saved your dad`s life.

50:00.287 --> 50:02.221
You should be proud of yourself.

50:02.256 --> 50:04.383
Which way did he go?

50:04.424 --> 50:06.085
You know, he killed Hawkins...

50:07.027 --> 50:08.494
and he nearly killed me.

50:16.470 --> 50:17.630
That way.

50:20.908 --> 50:22.375
Let`s go!

50:22.409 --> 50:23.569
Let it burn.

50:40.027 --> 50:42.655
Oh, shit.
Ain`t this a bitch?

50:42.696 --> 50:45.187
l`m not going to hurt you.

50:45.232 --> 50:48.292
You ain`t going to hurt me.
You have a nice day, OK?

50:48.335 --> 50:50.701
l`ll get the fuck
out your woods, OK?

50:50.737 --> 50:52.398
Just cool out. Chill.

50:52.439 --> 50:54.407
Nice wolf.
Cool, cool, cool.

50:59.179 --> 51:00.271
Stay right there.

51:25.772 --> 51:27.967
Oh, shit.

51:40.187 --> 51:42.018
-There he is!
-Out of my way. l got him.

51:45.993 --> 51:51.590
Oh, shit!

52:00.841 --> 52:02.172
You took my shot, Senior.

52:03.477 --> 52:04.637
Don`t ever take my shot again.

52:04.678 --> 52:06.202
What is that, a threat?

52:06.246 --> 52:07.736
He nearly killed me, not you.

52:08.649 --> 52:10.674
Just don`t take my shot.

52:10.717 --> 52:12.048
Or fucking what?

52:18.592 --> 52:20.025
Be careful.
Watch yourself.

52:20.060 --> 52:22.551
Let the fuck go of me.
Let me go, son!

52:27.134 --> 52:28.658
l`m going to have to put
a bullet in his ass.

52:28.702 --> 52:29.930
l see that now.

52:58.432 --> 52:59.592
Shit.

53:21.788 --> 53:23.949
lf he survived the river...

53:23.990 --> 53:26.185
there`s only one place
he can get out.

53:44.077 --> 53:45.806
Ha. Still dy.

54:05.966 --> 54:07.729
All right, gentlemen...

54:07.768 --> 54:09.360
we`ll go on foot from here.

54:09.403 --> 54:10.563
Dismount.

54:17.344 --> 54:18.470
He ain`t far now, Senior.

54:18.512 --> 54:20.503
No, he isn`t.

54:27.821 --> 54:29.288
Do you smell that?

54:29.322 --> 54:31.415
That idiot`s
smoking a cigarette.

55:22.876 --> 55:24.776
We`ve been had.

55:24.811 --> 55:25.971
Let me see.

55:33.353 --> 55:34.547
A tree smoking a cigarette.

55:37.891 --> 55:40.189
l told you this guy was good.
You didn`t believe me, did you?

55:42.195 --> 55:43.389
See, l know how to pick them.

55:54.441 --> 55:56.033
Sack of shit.

56:11.958 --> 56:13.289
Griffin, talk to me.

56:17.430 --> 56:18.863
Can you hear me?

56:18.899 --> 56:20.298
Come in.

56:20.333 --> 56:21.664
Griffin, do you copy?

56:21.701 --> 56:23.464
Shut the fuck up.

56:23.503 --> 56:25.130
Motherfucker.

56:28.441 --> 56:30.705
Griffin, your position, please.

56:37.217 --> 56:39.242
Griffin, come in.

56:46.326 --> 56:48.419
Griffin, talk to me.

56:48.461 --> 56:49.826
lf you`re lost...

56:50.964 --> 56:52.431
l`ll guide you home.

56:53.900 --> 56:55.891
Burns, Burns, you hear me?

56:59.673 --> 57:02.369
l wouldn`t mind talking
to Griffin.

57:02.409 --> 57:05.901
He can`t come to the phone.
Know what l`m saying?

57:06.646 --> 57:08.511
Mason, you`re a sack of shit.

57:08.548 --> 57:09.845
Let me talk to Griffin.

57:09.883 --> 57:12.579
Fuck what you want, Burns.
About what l want right now.

57:15.021 --> 57:16.249
l want you, Burns.

57:17.857 --> 57:19.324
What did l do?

57:19.359 --> 57:20.485
l got Griffin tied up...

57:20.527 --> 57:23.121
and you ain`t never going
to find him.

57:23.163 --> 57:24.960
l want you and only you.

57:24.998 --> 57:27.728
Fly me back to the city.

57:27.767 --> 57:29.564
After that,
l`ll tell you where he is.

57:30.470 --> 57:31.767
Otherwise, l`ll kill him.

57:33.073 --> 57:34.267
Let me sleep on it.

57:36.109 --> 57:37.974
You know, Mason...

57:38.011 --> 57:39.603
you know why
we`re going to find you?

57:41.648 --> 57:44.412
`Cause l can smell
your stinking ass from here.

57:44.451 --> 57:47.887
Yo, fuck you, Cole,
you punk sellout motherfucker.

57:47.921 --> 57:51.516
You`re going to do it my way...

57:51.558 --> 57:52.957
or your man`s going to be dead.

58:03.637 --> 58:04.797
Wake up.

58:07.240 --> 58:09.538
Your friends
don`t give two shits about you.

58:10.644 --> 58:13.636
Shut the fuck up, or l`ll bust
you in your motherfucking head.

58:14.914 --> 58:16.040
Listen.

58:16.082 --> 58:18.312
Burns ain`t going to come
looking for you.

58:18.351 --> 58:20.046
By now you should know...

58:20.086 --> 58:22.987
he don`t give a fuck
about shit but himself.

58:23.023 --> 58:25.924
Just shut up,
and l`ll take this thing off.

58:26.860 --> 58:29.090
`Cause l`ll kill you.
l don`t want to...

58:29.129 --> 58:30.323
but l`ll kill your ass.

58:30.363 --> 58:31.523
Shut up.

58:43.977 --> 58:45.308
l ain`t going to scream
no more...

58:48.381 --> 58:49.643
but if you are going
to kill me...

58:51.151 --> 58:52.914
stop being
such a chickenshit bitch...

58:52.952 --> 58:54.249
and pull the fucking trigger.

58:54.287 --> 58:56.221
Maybe l`m just having some fun.

58:58.591 --> 58:59.956
Of course you are.

59:00.994 --> 59:02.120
That`s your kind.

59:02.162 --> 59:05.131
You the motherfuckers
been tying to kill people.

59:05.165 --> 59:07.133
Then why don`t you do
what we do...

59:08.735 --> 59:10.202
and pull that fucking trigger?

59:11.971 --> 59:13.131
Go ahead.

59:13.973 --> 59:15.133
Pull it.

59:47.440 --> 59:50.739
Look at Sirius--the dog star.

59:51.945 --> 59:54.175
Yeah. You think
we`ll find Mason tomorrow?

59:57.584 --> 59:58.744
l know where he is.

01:00:00.487 --> 01:00:01.818
Yeah, sure you do.
Where is he?

01:00:04.924 --> 01:00:06.084
Over there.

01:00:08.795 --> 01:00:09.955
Take a look.

01:00:12.265 --> 01:00:13.596
The little hole in the mountain.

01:00:15.502 --> 01:00:19.598
We`ll have him
sit up all night waiting...

01:00:19.639 --> 01:00:22.005
then we`ll surprise him at dawn.

01:00:29.916 --> 01:00:31.076
How`s that grub?

01:00:32.018 --> 01:00:33.713
Pretty good?

01:00:33.753 --> 01:00:35.220
Pretty tasty?

01:00:35.255 --> 01:00:36.552
Good.

01:00:37.457 --> 01:00:40.017
Enjoy it, asshole.
lt`s going to be your last.

01:00:40.927 --> 01:00:43.794
You ain`t in no position
to be threatening me, cowboy.

01:00:45.698 --> 01:00:47.359
l ain`t even
threatening you, son...

01:00:48.902 --> 01:00:51.564
`cause as soon as you find
the balls to take care of me...

01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:53.936
you ain`t never going to make it
out of here alive, anyway.

01:00:55.308 --> 01:00:56.468
God.

01:00:59.045 --> 01:01:00.205
What`s up?

01:01:00.914 --> 01:01:03.712
Big, tough cowboy,
you scared of a few little bugs?

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.342
Ain`t never slept on the ground?

01:01:05.385 --> 01:01:08.411
l sleep in a bed, shithead,
not like an animal.

01:01:08.454 --> 01:01:10.854
Sleeping on the ground
don`t mean you`re an animal.

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:12.118
lt means you`re poor.

01:01:12.158 --> 01:01:13.318
Maybe.

01:01:14.527 --> 01:01:16.290
That may be...

01:01:16.329 --> 01:01:17.489
but you, Mason...

01:01:18.398 --> 01:01:19.592
are a waste.

01:01:19.632 --> 01:01:21.395
Know what?
l`m tired of you.

01:01:21.434 --> 01:01:23.026
What if l took this gun...

01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:25.333
and blow
your motherfucking brains out?

01:01:25.371 --> 01:01:28.101
You`d bleed just like me.
Then you`d understand.

01:01:28.141 --> 01:01:30.075
l don`t care about my life
anymore.

01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:32.202
Don`t you understand?

01:01:32.245 --> 01:01:34.110
l don`t give a shit!

01:01:34.147 --> 01:01:35.580
l don`t care!

01:01:50.864 --> 01:01:52.024
That`s crazy.

01:01:58.071 --> 01:01:59.561
Someone like you...

01:01:59.606 --> 01:02:01.039
just like you...

01:02:02.742 --> 01:02:04.710
followed my daughter
to school one day.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.445
The police report said that...

01:02:10.884 --> 01:02:13.910
she tried to get away from him.

01:02:15.021 --> 01:02:16.283
Nobody had ever caught him...

01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:19.781
and for all l know...

01:02:19.826 --> 01:02:21.293
it was you.

01:02:21.327 --> 01:02:22.988
Ain`t that a bitch?

01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:25.463
You got a personal problem...

01:02:25.498 --> 01:02:27.523
and it ain`t got jack shit
to do with me.

01:02:27.567 --> 01:02:29.467
You said you fucking killed--

01:02:29.502 --> 01:02:31.094
You don`t know shit about me.

01:02:41.848 --> 01:02:43.645
l was a mechanic, all right?

01:02:44.984 --> 01:02:48.147
l used to work like a fucking
dog, night and day.

01:02:49.289 --> 01:02:52.452
l had a wife,
and l had a newborn kid.

01:02:54.894 --> 01:02:57.294
We lived
in a fucked-up part of town.

01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:58.820
That`s where poor people live.

01:02:59.832 --> 01:03:01.527
l was, like, the manager
of this building.

01:03:01.567 --> 01:03:04.661
That`s the only way
l could stay there for free.

01:03:04.704 --> 01:03:07.172
Had to work around the place,
you know what l`m saying?

01:03:08.474 --> 01:03:11.409
The place was--should`ve
been fucking condemned.

01:03:15.114 --> 01:03:16.809
l used to go to the city
all the time...

01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:18.874
and told them
they had to get shit together.

01:03:18.918 --> 01:03:20.909
The place wasn`t safe.

01:03:23.222 --> 01:03:24.348
They didn`t give a fuck.

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:26.585
They don`t give a fuck about
people who live in the ghetto.

01:03:28.628 --> 01:03:31.756
l told my girl l was going
to get around to it, you know?

01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:35.430
The place was a firetrap.

01:03:38.571 --> 01:03:40.664
So one day l come home late...

01:03:40.707 --> 01:03:42.800
and l see this commotion
out in the street...

01:03:45.411 --> 01:03:46.810
and l`m looking...

01:03:46.846 --> 01:03:49.974
and l notice
this ain`t where l live...

01:03:50.016 --> 01:03:52.507
but at the same time,
it was my building...

01:03:52.552 --> 01:03:54.349
but l`m saying
it`s not my building...

01:03:56.022 --> 01:03:57.182
but it was.

01:03:57.223 --> 01:03:58.656
l ran inside.

01:03:58.691 --> 01:04:02.024
By the time l got in there,
my wife and kids was dead.

01:04:09.002 --> 01:04:10.663
l could`ve...

01:04:10.703 --> 01:04:14.298
l kept putting off
fixing that place, man.

01:04:16.442 --> 01:04:18.307
l just kept putting it off.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.479
You said that you killed them.

01:04:25.985 --> 01:04:27.350
They`re dead, ain`t they?

01:04:53.546 --> 01:04:54.706
Hold your fire!

01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:59.647
For Christ`s sake,
hold your fire.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:02.178
Where is he?

01:05:02.221 --> 01:05:04.985
Who do l look like to you,
Hary fucking Houdini?

01:05:05.024 --> 01:05:06.787
l don`t know where he is.

01:05:11.464 --> 01:05:12.624
Y`all leave me any water?

01:05:12.665 --> 01:05:13.859
Yeah, on my ATV.

01:05:15.034 --> 01:05:16.592
-Here?
-Yeah. Last one.

01:05:18.471 --> 01:05:20.405
What time did Mason leave you?

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.032
Burns, l truly have no idea.

01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:24.606
You don`t know much, do you?

01:05:24.644 --> 01:05:25.975
Maybe not.

01:05:26.012 --> 01:05:27.172
You hungy?

01:05:29.382 --> 01:05:30.542
Can l take two?

01:05:32.085 --> 01:05:34.849
l`ll tell you what l do know.
l`m out of here.

01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:37.685
l`m going back where l belong.
l`m going home.

01:05:37.723 --> 01:05:40.385
-No, you`re not.
-Oh, yeah, l am.

01:05:41.761 --> 01:05:43.456
Lookit, Doc Hawkins is dead.

01:05:43.496 --> 01:05:45.521
He ain`t never coming back...

01:05:45.565 --> 01:05:48.557
and Mason could`ve killed me
last night, but he didn`t.

01:05:48.601 --> 01:05:49.727
Gotta let him go.

01:05:49.769 --> 01:05:52.465
Mr. Griffin,
you know we can`t do that.

01:05:52.505 --> 01:05:54.370
What are you afraid of?

01:05:54.407 --> 01:05:56.671
You think
he`ll go to the authorities?

01:05:56.709 --> 01:05:58.472
You`ll never hear
from him again.

01:05:58.511 --> 01:05:59.876
He`s probably right.

01:05:59.912 --> 01:06:02.938
We`re not taking any chances.
Are you crazy?

01:06:04.584 --> 01:06:06.882
-Think about this.
-l have.

01:06:06.919 --> 01:06:08.147
No, you haven`t.

01:06:09.255 --> 01:06:10.415
Well, look at all of you.

01:06:11.858 --> 01:06:13.382
Listen once.
l`m going to say it once.

01:06:15.428 --> 01:06:16.827
l ain`t going out with you
no more.

01:06:16.863 --> 01:06:18.660
l`m through.

01:06:18.698 --> 01:06:21.258
lf l can`t stop you,
l can`t stop you...

01:06:22.435 --> 01:06:23.595
but l`m going home.

01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:29.735
You stupid Texas cowboy,
you stop it right there.

01:06:30.943 --> 01:06:32.103
Or what?

01:06:34.647 --> 01:06:36.137
What, you`re going to shoot me
in the back?

01:06:42.555 --> 01:06:43.715
l lied.

01:06:48.594 --> 01:06:50.755
Dad! Dad! Do something!

01:06:52.165 --> 01:06:53.291
You son of a--

01:06:53.332 --> 01:06:55.960
Mr. Wolfe, we`re all
in this together, remember?

01:06:56.002 --> 01:06:57.128
That`s the agreement.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:59.365
Just like a family--
nobody ever gets away.

01:06:59.405 --> 01:07:00.497
lsn`t that right?

01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:02.701
That`s right.

01:07:03.709 --> 01:07:05.006
We`re all in this together.

01:07:08.948 --> 01:07:10.677
-Stop whining.
-That`s enough.

01:07:11.717 --> 01:07:12.979
-Little punk.
-You all right?

01:07:15.755 --> 01:07:17.120
Take a deep breath.

01:07:17.156 --> 01:07:18.316
Now, listen.

01:07:19.425 --> 01:07:20.915
Now it`s more than just Mason.

01:07:22.328 --> 01:07:24.193
Hawkins and Griffin--

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:27.529
they were real people
who counted in the real world.

01:07:27.567 --> 01:07:29.262
l`m as real as they were,
asshole.

01:07:29.302 --> 01:07:31.099
You`re nothing, Mason.

01:07:33.306 --> 01:07:36.605
lt`s such a beautiful day
out here, Mason.

01:07:36.642 --> 01:07:38.610
Perfect day for hunting.

01:07:38.644 --> 01:07:39.770
Where do you think he is?

01:07:39.812 --> 01:07:42.337
lt`s down to you three of you
and the boy.

01:07:42.381 --> 01:07:45.942
l got my own gun.
My odds are getting better.

01:07:45.985 --> 01:07:49.477
Your odds don`t mean anything
out here, Mason.

01:07:49.522 --> 01:07:52.184
What matters
is if you win or lo--

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.451
That wasn`t even close!

01:07:56.495 --> 01:07:58.725
You never shot
a big bore before?

01:07:58.764 --> 01:08:01.028
Yo, Cole, your mama`s up here.

01:08:01.067 --> 01:08:03.831
l`m tired of this faggot.
Let`s get his ass.

01:08:03.869 --> 01:08:05.029
Damn.

01:08:38.337 --> 01:08:39.861
He thinks we won`t follow him
in the water.

01:08:39.904 --> 01:08:41.064
Well, which way?

01:08:43.009 --> 01:08:44.169
Let`s get wet.

01:09:05.531 --> 01:09:06.862
We could fish in this.

01:09:29.055 --> 01:09:30.613
Shit.

01:09:30.656 --> 01:09:31.816
Something`s not--

01:09:33.091 --> 01:09:34.787
Something`s not right
about this.

01:09:42.167 --> 01:09:43.328
l don`t like this.

01:10:22.808 --> 01:10:24.298
There he is!

01:10:24.343 --> 01:10:25.640
Get him !
Get him !

01:10:34.787 --> 01:10:37.051
Keep it going.

01:10:41.494 --> 01:10:43.519
Gotcha now.

01:10:55.441 --> 01:10:57.602
You ain`t--
you ain`t the last pick.

01:10:57.643 --> 01:10:59.907
Oh, damn.

01:10:59.945 --> 01:11:01.742
He ain`t the last pick.

01:11:02.648 --> 01:11:04.138
What happened?

01:11:18.197 --> 01:11:21.223
Relax. You`re OK.

01:11:21.267 --> 01:11:23.326
-Next year.
-Shut up.

01:11:23.369 --> 01:11:25.599
Next year, we got to bring--

01:11:25.638 --> 01:11:27.162
We got to bring more pigs.

01:11:27.206 --> 01:11:29.572
We got to bring the girls up
next time.

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:32.536
Somebody...

01:11:32.578 --> 01:11:33.738
Walter.

01:11:35.915 --> 01:11:38.315
We`re going to have
to put you to bed.

01:13:10.242 --> 01:13:12.176
Derrick, l`m sory.

01:13:12.211 --> 01:13:14.111
lt wasn`t supposed to be
like this.

01:13:14.146 --> 01:13:15.875
What was it supposed to be like?

01:13:16.782 --> 01:13:18.147
Like back at the cabin.

01:13:18.183 --> 01:13:20.151
When you saved me,
l was so proud of you.

01:13:23.989 --> 01:13:26.287
l`ll help you find Mason,
maybe even kill him dead...

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.125
but know one thing.

01:13:29.161 --> 01:13:31.254
lf we get through this shit...

01:13:31.297 --> 01:13:34.698
l will never forget this,
because l am not like you.

01:13:58.891 --> 01:14:00.688
Shit.

01:14:00.726 --> 01:14:01.886
Damn.

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.007
What the hell`s he shooting at?

01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:19.010
l don`t care.
Come on.

01:14:26.418 --> 01:14:27.715
Three left.
lt`s gotta work.

01:14:27.753 --> 01:14:29.414
Come on.

01:14:56.882 --> 01:14:58.315
That son of a bitch.

01:15:00.919 --> 01:15:02.079
What do we do now?

01:15:02.121 --> 01:15:03.884
Go after him.
What do you think?

01:15:03.922 --> 01:15:05.082
Afraid of heights?

01:15:07.393 --> 01:15:08.553
Good.

01:15:11.563 --> 01:15:12.723
Bastard.

01:15:23.108 --> 01:15:24.632
-You stay here, Derrick.
-Fuck you, Dad.

01:15:33.752 --> 01:15:34.980
Way to go, Derrick.

01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:38.656
You`re doing good, son.

01:15:54.807 --> 01:15:56.399
Behind you!

01:15:56.442 --> 01:15:57.773
He`s behind us!

01:15:58.811 --> 01:16:00.142
Derrick, look out!

01:16:00.179 --> 01:16:01.806
Dad! Help me!

01:16:01.847 --> 01:16:03.610
l can`t hold on!

01:16:04.650 --> 01:16:06.242

01:16:06.919 --> 01:16:08.819
Help, Dad!

01:16:08.854 --> 01:16:10.685

Hang on.

01:16:10.723 --> 01:16:12.520
Don`t let me fall!
Dad, help!

01:16:12.558 --> 01:16:14.583

01:16:14.626 --> 01:16:15.786
Don`t let go, Derrick.

01:16:15.828 --> 01:16:17.386
Help, l`m slipping!

01:16:29.875 --> 01:16:32.139
Mr. Wolfe, Senior.

01:16:34.012 --> 01:16:37.709
Let`s get the son of a bitch
who did this.

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:39.149
That goddamn son of a bitch.

01:16:40.152 --> 01:16:41.380
He`s mine.

01:16:59.505 --> 01:17:01.063
lt didn`t go in.

01:17:01.106 --> 01:17:02.937
Give him to me!

01:17:10.849 --> 01:17:12.009
Shit!

01:17:28.967 --> 01:17:30.093
Shit.

01:17:30.135 --> 01:17:32.330
We can`t get him from here.

01:17:32.371 --> 01:17:33.531
We`ll have to go down.

01:17:40.445 --> 01:17:42.504
l hope he`s not dead.

01:18:47.613 --> 01:18:49.240
You son of a bitch!

01:18:51.383 --> 01:18:53.817
Show yourself,
you son of a bitch!

01:18:58.290 --> 01:19:01.259
Mr. Wolfe, don`t lose your head.

01:19:01.293 --> 01:19:02.726
That`s exactly what he wants.

01:19:02.761 --> 01:19:05.252
l didn`t hear you.
What did you say?

01:19:05.297 --> 01:19:06.423
Go ahead.

01:19:06.465 --> 01:19:07.625
You going to kill me?

01:19:09.234 --> 01:19:10.724
Nice move.

01:19:12.404 --> 01:19:14.372
Let me tell you
what we`re going to do.

01:19:16.508 --> 01:19:17.998
lt`s going to be dark soon.

01:19:19.111 --> 01:19:21.944
We`ll wait and sit.

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:24.073
He wants us.
He wants us bad.

01:19:25.017 --> 01:19:27.542
We`ll let him come to us.

01:19:27.586 --> 01:19:28.746
Sound...

01:19:29.821 --> 01:19:30.947

01:19:30.989 --> 01:19:32.752
Be still.

01:19:32.791 --> 01:19:33.985
Be patient.

01:19:35.127 --> 01:19:37.152
Be a fucking hunter.

01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:47.094
After l kill Mason...

01:19:49.675 --> 01:19:50.835
we`ll settle up.

01:19:52.611 --> 01:19:54.203
That`ll be...nice.

01:20:00.118 --> 01:20:01.278
l`ll be over here.

01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:05.315
Remember...

01:20:05.357 --> 01:20:07.985

01:21:56.868 --> 01:21:58.130

01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:11.715
l know you`re out there, Mason.

01:22:14.252 --> 01:22:15.810
Don`t be afraid, Mason.

01:22:16.822 --> 01:22:17.982
Come up here like a man!

01:22:19.424 --> 01:22:20.914
Look, Mason, l got no gun.

01:22:34.039 --> 01:22:35.438

01:22:42.481 --> 01:22:44.915

01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:46.975
Show your fuckin` self!

01:23:36.334 --> 01:23:38.859
You can`t hurt me
because you`re nothing.

01:23:38.904 --> 01:23:41.532
You`re a maggot.
You`re a worm !

01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:44.202
You`re nothing!

01:23:44.242 --> 01:23:45.766
Die! Die!

01:23:45.810 --> 01:23:47.334
Fuck that!

01:24:57.415 --> 01:24:59.576
-Burn, baby.
-Shit.

01:25:09.294 --> 01:25:11.057

01:27:08.146 --> 01:27:10.842

of Hell`s Canyon Outfitters.

01:27:10.882 --> 01:27:13.112

but nobody returned my call.

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:23.589

01:27:23.628 --> 01:27:26.188

01:28:59.557 --> 01:29:01.889
Excuse me, Father.

01:29:01.926 --> 01:29:04.087
God bless you, child.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:10.565
Could you spare a little change?

01:29:10.602 --> 01:29:11.864

01:29:11.903 --> 01:29:13.097

01:29:15.039 --> 01:29:16.563
Stupid asshole.

01:29:47.605 --> 01:29:49.334
Hey, Father Burns.

01:30:29.547 --> 01:30:30.980
Ah, shit!

01:30:34.552 --> 01:30:35.917
How does that feel, huh?

01:30:37.922 --> 01:30:40.083
No mercy, eh, Mason?

01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:09.917
Holy May...

01:31:09.954 --> 01:31:11.353

01:31:11.389 --> 01:31:13.186

01:31:13.958 --> 01:31:15.118
Shit!

01:31:23.368 --> 01:31:25.063
How the fuck
does this feel, Burns?

01:31:25.103 --> 01:31:26.900
All your punk-ass friends
are dead now!

01:31:26.938 --> 01:31:29.168
How the fuck does this feel now?

01:31:31.843 --> 01:31:35.370
This...is the moment
we`ve been waiting for.

01:31:40.785 --> 01:31:41.945
Do it.

01:31:44.188 --> 01:31:45.348
Finish the game.

01:31:53.064 --> 01:31:54.224

01:31:56.768 --> 01:31:57.928
Bang!

01:31:59.904 --> 01:32:00.996
Game`s over.

01:32:37.175 --> 01:32:38.335
Lucky me.

01:32:40.912 --> 01:32:43.506
There`s something you should
always do when you find a gun.

01:32:43.548 --> 01:32:44.708
Say good-bye.

01:32:53.891 --> 01:32:56.291
Always check the barrel.
