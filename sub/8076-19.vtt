00:04.738 --> 00:08.142
[music playing]

00:08.176 --> 00:09.310
How long has it been?

00:09.343 --> 00:12.346
Two hours and no
contractions at all, right?

00:12.380 --> 00:15.316
Not even any little ones that
you didn't tell us about?

00:15.349 --> 00:16.617
No, but I feel
like my heart is

00:16.650 --> 00:20.088
going to pound out of my
chest and fly around the room.

00:20.121 --> 00:23.291
Well, if it does,
your dad will catch it.

00:23.324 --> 00:26.094
Or at least bat it back down.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.061
Where the hell is David?

00:27.095 --> 00:28.396
I mean, what's
taking him so long?

00:28.429 --> 00:30.731
Oh, Darlene, it is really,
really bad traffic out there.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.100
I know he's doing
everything he can

00:32.133 --> 00:33.367
to get here as soon as he can.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.236
I'm sure he'll
be here any minute.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.804
You said that an hour ago.

00:36.837 --> 00:37.705
Honey, come on.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.307
Just try and relax.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.841
Oh sure, I'm lying
here with God knows

00:40.874 --> 00:42.476
what coursing through my veins.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.645
I don't know whether my baby
is going to live or die.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.480
No one has a clue
where my husband is

00:46.514 --> 00:47.815
and you're telling me to relax.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.318
Yeah, I want you to stop
talking like that, OK, Darlene?

00:50.351 --> 00:52.986
Because I know that, like,
negative talk like that

00:53.020 --> 00:55.189
is attracting negative energy.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.558
[laughter]

00:57.591 --> 00:58.459
I'm so sorry.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.060
I got here as fast as I could.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.629
How do you feel?

01:01.662 --> 01:03.097
I'm fine, David.

01:03.131 --> 01:03.997
How about the baby?

01:07.335 --> 01:08.136
We don't know yet.

01:12.706 --> 01:16.377
All right, where do we stand?

01:16.410 --> 01:19.480
Well, we tried several drugs
to stop the contractions.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.983
And now we're on the
big one, ridodrine.

01:23.016 --> 01:26.086
And I don't know, it has some
side effects like, you know,

01:26.120 --> 01:27.255
rapid heart beat.

01:27.288 --> 01:30.191
Got it.

01:30.224 --> 01:33.194
Yeah, but so
far it is working.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.596
So then the
contractions have stopped.

01:35.629 --> 01:39.200
Yeah, I mean, as of right now.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.634
OK, what do we do now?

01:40.668 --> 01:42.303
Just cross our fingers
and hope for the best.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.676
Uh, OK, all right.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.378
You guys must be tired.
And I'm here now.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.712
Why don't you just
go home and lie down.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.714
I'll call you if
anything happens.

01:53.747 --> 01:59.987
Wow, when did you get this
new take charge attitude?

02:00.020 --> 02:01.922
I don't know, it just
kind of came over me.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.024
Oh, we'll go on
down to the cafeteria.

02:04.057 --> 02:07.528
Oh boy, my water just broke.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.629
[theme song]

02:08.662 --> 02:12.366
What doesn't kill us
is making us stronger.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.538
We're gonna last longer than
that greatest wall in China,

02:17.571 --> 02:21.008
or that rabbit with a drum.

02:21.041 --> 02:25.946
If there's one thing that
I believe while waiting

02:25.979 --> 02:30.418
for my turn, it's that in
each lifetime, rain falls,

02:30.451 --> 02:33.854
but you also get some sun.

02:33.887 --> 02:40.228
And we'll make out better
than OK, hear what I say.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.014
Honey, you got to
stay calm and know

03:01.048 --> 03:03.417
that we're here for you and
everything's going to be OK.

03:03.451 --> 03:04.952
I'm scared.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.754
It's OK to be a little scared.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.322
You should have seen your
mom when she had Becky.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.393
I might have been
scared but your dad

03:12.426 --> 03:13.661
passed out in the waiting room.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.732
Don't leave me.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.167
I won't

03:20.200 --> 03:22.503
I wish I could go
through this for you.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.306
Yeah, me too.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.040
Well, we're ready to go.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.176
Oh, you want to
start without me?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.778
You'll be in the
delivery room very soon

03:30.811 --> 03:32.446
and we're going to take
real good care of you.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.317
You hear that, honey?
Everything's under control.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.919
OK, well, we're going to
go into the waiting room now.

03:38.952 --> 03:42.356
I got DJ saving all
the chairs for us.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.958
That one-legged guy is probably
getting a little cranky by now.

03:48.161 --> 03:51.198
Dr. Redmen, Darlene's
only 28 weeks along.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.166
Everything's going
to be fine, right?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.502
Well, I'm going to
be honest with you,

03:54.535 --> 03:56.804
there's always an
element of risk.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.806
Why is this happening now?

03:58.839 --> 04:02.075
Darlene, no one knows what
exactly triggers normal labor,

04:02.109 --> 04:03.877
let alone premature labor.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.046
But babies this
age have survived.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.148
You are young and
healthy and you've

04:08.181 --> 04:10.284
had very good prenatal care.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.485
And that's really
good, isn't it?

04:11.519 --> 04:12.886
I mean, it means a lot, right?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.522
You bet it does.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.056
So you stay optimistic, OK?

04:16.089 --> 04:16.890
Yeah.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.195
The world population
is like five billion

04:22.229 --> 04:24.064
and they all had to be born.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.434
How can this be so hard?

04:26.467 --> 04:28.001
OK, listen to me.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.638
You are very, very strong.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.205
More important than that,
you're very stubborn.

04:32.239 --> 04:33.774
And I think God likes that.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.977
So everything is going
to be just fine, OK?

04:37.010 --> 04:37.811
I hope you're right.

04:40.514 --> 04:44.885
Here we go, a few more
minutes before we're parents.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.387
Is there anything
left that we wanted

04:46.420 --> 04:48.088
to do before we had kids?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.190
[laughter]

04:50.223 --> 04:52.793
We were going to go to Paris.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.663
Might be a little
late to book a fight.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.765
Well, I'll settle for
a cheese omelet then.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.035
I love you.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.340
I love you so much.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.849
Mark, you're wearing
a track in the floor.

05:15.883 --> 05:16.684
Sorry.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.525
I really have a bad
feeling about this.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.460
Don't think that way, Becky.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.596
As [inaudible] says,
you must learn to turn

05:28.629 --> 05:30.964
the negative into a positive.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.367
Yeah, you should listen
to your grandma, Becky.

05:33.401 --> 05:37.270
Apparently being gay
means more than just

05:37.304 --> 05:39.573
wanting to wear flannel
shirts and Birkenstocks.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.575
It also makes you smarter.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.445
Thank you, Roseanne, I have
been trying to positively

05:44.478 --> 05:46.279
explore different avenues.

05:49.883 --> 05:53.120
Hey, check out that
nurse with the crewcut.

05:53.153 --> 05:56.957
[laughter] Made you look.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.495
I just called Leon
to check on the kids.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.763
How's Darlene doing?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.632
She's been in there
for over an hour.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.835
Geez, you look terrible.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.938
Well thank you for
the compliment, Jackie,

06:10.971 --> 06:13.874
would you like to check my
breath while you're at it?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.208
[laughter]

06:15.242 --> 06:18.011
Honey, want to take
another walk down the hall?

06:18.045 --> 06:20.814
Mr. And Mrs. Conner?

06:20.848 --> 06:24.618
Your daughter has just
given birth to a baby girl.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.253
Is everything OK?

06:26.286 --> 06:27.354
Well, Darlene is fine.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.122
David's with her right now.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.458
And the baby?

06:30.491 --> 06:33.494
Well, being so
premature, her lungs

06:33.527 --> 06:36.396
are not sufficiently developed
for her to breathe on her own.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.466
At this point, she
can't even cry.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.734
We have her down in NICU.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.704
She's in an incubator,
on a respirator and IV.

06:43.737 --> 06:48.141
The next 24 to 48 hours are
going to be very critical.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.810
What exactly does that mean?

06:49.843 --> 06:51.945
It means they don't
know anything, Becky.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.016
Well, yeah, so what now?

06:56.049 --> 06:59.252
I mean, isn't there
anything that you can do?

06:59.286 --> 07:01.489
Well actually, the best thing
we can do right now is to wait.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.593
So that's what you're just--

07:05.626 --> 07:07.928
that's all you can tell
us is that we should wait?

07:07.961 --> 07:09.830
Look, Mrs. Conner,
I know this is hard.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.131
I know that.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.866
But please, it really is the
best we can do right now.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.301
Well, no.
I can't accept that.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.436
I want to get a second opinion.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.506
All right, I'd be happy
to give you the names

07:18.539 --> 07:19.840
of some neonatologists.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.575
There's a couple of
good doctors in Chicago.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.911
No, I'm not
interested in good.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.879
OK, I want the best.

07:25.913 --> 07:30.518
If we have to go to New York or
Australia or Japan or Timbuktu,

07:30.551 --> 07:31.719
I really don't care.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.688
I have all the
money in the world

07:34.722 --> 07:39.459
and I want the very best doctor
on this whole damn planet.

07:39.493 --> 07:43.864
[music playing]

07:50.838 --> 07:52.005
Well, they're
trying to get a hold

07:52.039 --> 07:54.074
of that doctor in Australia.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.544
Go in there and find out what's
going on with that doctor

07:56.577 --> 07:59.747
Igarashi there in Tokyo.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.815
We're running out of
specialist, Roseanne.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.884
There's 12 on the list,
we've already called 10.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.152
I know, maybe
it's time we started

08:05.185 --> 08:06.987
thinking of some alternatives.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.657
What, acupuncture?

08:09.690 --> 08:10.958
Well, yeah.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.160
Or herbalist, or
some kind of healer.

08:13.193 --> 08:16.029
I mean, Western medicine
can't have all the answers.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.799
In other cultures, they take
a whole different approach.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.500
Like in India you know
when people are sick,

08:20.534 --> 08:21.468
you know what they do?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.570
They take them
down and they give

08:22.603 --> 08:24.738
them a bath in the holy river.

08:24.772 --> 08:25.639
You're making that up.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.540
That doesn't work.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.541
Oh yes it does, Jackie.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.609
And you know why?

08:28.642 --> 08:31.945
Because they believe
it's going to work.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.647
I read that in all those
books that Nancy gave me.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.382
And you know what, they all
say the very same thing.

08:35.415 --> 08:36.917
You know what they say?

08:36.950 --> 08:41.755
That the spiritual is the
cause for the physical.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.825
OK, they talked to that
Dr. Phillips in London.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.459
He's afraid he can't
get here in time.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.562
But he says there's this great
South African doctor who's

08:48.596 --> 08:50.163
giving a lecture in Boston.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.131
That's a couple hours away.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.532
We could get him.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.201
No, I want them both.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.704
You tell that London guy to
take the Concorde into New York

08:56.737 --> 08:58.906
and then we'll charter a
plane and get him down here.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.474
And go get that South African
doctor on the phone, too.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.710
Got it.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.511
For once, we can
afford the best.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.014
And we're going to get it.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.918
[music playing]

09:12.019 --> 09:14.454
Hey.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.823
Brought you some
more applesauce.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.591
I'm not hungry right
now, thanks anyway.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.864
How are you doing?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.532
Better.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.002
I mean, I'm still pretty
wrung out, though.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.871
Any new word about the baby?

09:30.904 --> 09:33.040
No, I can go check
now, again, if you want--

09:33.073 --> 09:36.143
No, it's OK.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.411
This is really happening
to us, isn't it?

09:41.314 --> 09:42.215
I'm afraid so.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.516
What made this happen?

09:43.550 --> 09:45.218
I mean, what did I do?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.020
It wasn't anything
that you did.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.488
I mean, I'm not a drinker.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.023
I don't smoke.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.591
I only did drugs once.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.960
That was a long time ago.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.862
Could I have been eating the
wrong thing the whole time?

09:54.895 --> 09:55.996
You're a vegetarian.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.197
You're one of the
healthiest eaters I know.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.565
Maybe it's my
physical, like some kind

09:58.598 --> 10:00.300
of genetic defect or something.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.935
I don't think it was
anything like that either.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.972
Well then what's
the answer, David?

10:05.005 --> 10:07.240
I mean, we know the question.

10:07.274 --> 10:11.578
Why was my baby
born prematurely?

10:11.611 --> 10:15.582
And why is it
probably going to die?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.185
No one can answer that.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.519
Well, if it's not
something physical,

10:19.552 --> 10:22.589
I mean, maybe I'm being
punished for something.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.191
Sweetheart, don't
do that to yourself.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.259
That's ridiculous.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.527
I mean, why is it ridiculous?

10:27.560 --> 10:29.296
We don't know everything.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.431
Maybe there's some
unknowable power at work,

10:31.464 --> 10:34.334
like some kind of universal
force, that's punishing

10:34.367 --> 10:35.535
me for something that I did.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.137
You didn't do anything wrong.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.338
Well, I must have, David.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.107
Because if there's nothing
physically wrong with me

10:40.140 --> 10:41.474
and I didn't do
anything morally wrong,

10:41.508 --> 10:42.575
then nothing makes any sense.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.816
Why do I deserve this?

10:48.849 --> 10:50.283
No, no.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.352
Look at me.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.421
You don't deserve this.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.523
OK, you do not deserve this.

10:56.556 --> 10:57.758
I do not deserve this.

10:57.791 --> 11:01.929
Our baby does not deserve this.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.231
These things happen, OK?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.398
No one deserves them.

11:08.035 --> 11:08.836
OK?

11:11.905 --> 11:14.307
Come here.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.778
I'm here for you.

11:17.811 --> 11:18.846
I'm always here for you.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.587
I must have walked across
this room 1,000 times.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.856
How long have
they been in there?

11:28.889 --> 11:29.990
An hour.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.391
Well, how long does it
take to examine a baby?

11:31.424 --> 11:34.527
I mean she's only the--

11:34.561 --> 11:36.063
I'm sorry.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.832
It's OK, Mark.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.968
Oh Roseanne, your
high-priced specialist

11:41.001 --> 11:43.236
is sure taking their time.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.505
That's because they're
high-priced specialists,

11:45.538 --> 11:46.506
mother.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.441
Yeah, and for the
money I pay them,

11:48.475 --> 11:52.245
they better be
taking a lot of time.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.314
Dr. Phillips,
what's happening?

11:54.347 --> 11:56.817
Doctor Nakozi and I
have examined the baby.

11:56.850 --> 12:00.754
I'm afraid that we both
concur with Dr. Redmen.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.155
Does Darlene know?

12:02.189 --> 12:04.724
Yes, we've gone over
everything with them.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.560
I want you to know, everything
that can be done is being done.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.329
We shouldn't give up hope.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.764
Oh man.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.598
Oh man.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.635
I don't understand.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.171
You men are supposed to
be the best in your field.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.672
You sure you tried everything?

12:19.706 --> 12:21.308
Yes, we have, Mr. Conner.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.377
Now isn't there some
kind of experimental drug

12:24.411 --> 12:25.813
or some machine or something.

12:25.846 --> 12:30.818
I mean, you do understand, don't
you, that money is no object.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.120
It's not a question
of money, Mrs. Conner.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.255
Unfortunately we
cannot duplicate

12:35.288 --> 12:37.224
the conditions in the womb.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.892
But this is crazy, I
mean, there's got to be

12:38.926 --> 12:40.493
something that you can do.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.029
Well, I wish there
was, Mrs. Connor.

12:42.062 --> 12:42.863
I'm so sorry.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.639
Can we see the baby?

12:52.672 --> 12:54.174
Of course you can.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.675
But don't be shocked
when you see her.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.945
She doesn't look like
a full term baby looks.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.247
Her skin is a
little translucent.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.314
And she's very tiny.

13:09.689 --> 13:13.994
[music playing]

13:18.999 --> 13:22.369
She's so beautiful.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.437
She's my daughter.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.941
She's my beautiful
little daughter.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.410
I can't stand to look at her
hooked up with all this stuff.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.184
Is there any point to this?

13:37.217 --> 13:38.919
Well, in some
instances like these,

13:38.952 --> 13:41.821
parents decide to
unplug the machine

13:41.855 --> 13:44.824
and let nature take its course.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.664
Well, David, I think we
have a decision to make.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.034
Wait, are you saying
that this is it for her?

13:54.067 --> 13:57.404
Well, if you're asking
my medical opinion,

13:57.437 --> 13:59.006
I would say that
she has very little

13:59.039 --> 14:02.342
chance to survive on her own.

14:02.375 --> 14:06.846
Well, I mean, I think
that she deserves a chance

14:06.880 --> 14:11.018
to experience life not hooked
up to all these machines

14:11.051 --> 14:12.519
and tubes and stuff.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.125
Yeah, I think she's right.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.894
All right, well I'll send
in a nurse with some forms

14:20.928 --> 14:22.662
for you to sign.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.763
David, let's take a walk.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.232
- I don't want to leave.
- No, come on.

14:25.265 --> 14:25.665
Just a minute.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.333
Come on.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.336
I'm coming with you.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.170
Yeah, me too.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.046
You hang in there, David.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.247
I don't know if
I can take this.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.148
It's hard.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.349
I know it's hard.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.450
But sometimes you
just got to put

14:43.483 --> 14:45.018
one foot in front of the
other, even though you

14:45.052 --> 14:46.753
don't know where you're going.

14:46.786 --> 14:47.921
I feel like I'm
going to lose it.

14:47.955 --> 14:48.821
No you're not.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.090
No you're not.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.725
I've never seen you as together
as you were today, Dave.

14:52.759 --> 14:53.693
All right?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.128
You're going to make
it through this.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.496
Yeah, you're doing great.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.630
Darlene needs you, David.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.199
You've got to stay focused.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.301
Just when you think you don't
have anything more to give,

15:01.334 --> 15:02.902
you've got to find more to give.

15:02.936 --> 15:06.506
I don't know if
I can, Mr. Conner.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.875
David, look, I know it's not
politically correct to say

15:08.908 --> 15:09.943
this, but you are the man.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.845
Darlene needs you to
be strong right now.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.414
I know, I know.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.582
Hey, guys.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.217
Hey, DJ, let me show
how to steal candy

15:17.250 --> 15:19.119
out of this machine over here.
- How do you do that?

15:19.152 --> 15:20.988
It's easy, you just need a
hairpin and a soldering iron.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.994
David, I know
I'm not your dad,

15:27.027 --> 15:28.428
but you're like a son to me.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.398
And I'm going to get
you through this.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.333
It just happened
so fast, you know?

15:37.070 --> 15:38.671
Just a year ago
things were simple.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.674
And then Darlene got
pregnant and we got married.

15:41.708 --> 15:45.612
And I'm sorry, Mr.
Conner, but I'll

15:45.645 --> 15:49.249
admit that it took me a
long time to even get used

15:49.282 --> 15:52.752
to the idea of being a father.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.456
But now I am.

15:56.489 --> 16:00.927
And I want it more than
anything in the world.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.462
It's just too much.

16:02.495 --> 16:06.033
How do I deal with it all?

16:06.066 --> 16:09.102
Look, David, I
ain't no philosopher,

16:09.136 --> 16:13.840
but everyone knows that there
is good and there's bad, OK?

16:13.873 --> 16:16.076
But nobody thinks
that the bad stuff is

16:16.109 --> 16:17.210
ever going to happen to them.

16:17.244 --> 16:21.781
And then one day, wham,
all of a sudden it does.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.151
And you think there's no
way that you can go on.

16:26.886 --> 16:30.057
But the day goes by.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.424
And another day goes by.

16:31.458 --> 16:36.563
Then a week, a month, a year.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.699
And you look back.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.935
Hey, I got through that.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.672
I don't know how, but I made it.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.379
I am not going to let
her down, Mr. Conner.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.213
I know you're not.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.018
Can we walk for awhile.

16:59.052 --> 17:02.089
Yeah, sure.

17:02.122 --> 17:06.993
[music playing]

17:32.885 --> 17:37.590
God, she just
looks so fragile.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.058
We'll let you all
have some privacy.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.535
What am I going to do, mom?

17:48.568 --> 17:51.971
I just-- I just think
we should all hold her.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.941
Are you sure we should
do this, Roseanne?

17:54.974 --> 17:56.809
I'm not sure of anything, mom.

17:56.843 --> 18:04.517
Except I know that she
comes from a long line

18:04.551 --> 18:07.187
of women who fight and survive.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.159
Looks like some kind of coven.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.829
Hi, you.

18:16.863 --> 18:17.730
Hi.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.500
You are so beautiful.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.170
You know, when I was
about five years old,

18:23.203 --> 18:24.904
we were riding in the car.

18:24.937 --> 18:29.742
And I was leaning up against
the door and all of a sudden,

18:29.776 --> 18:31.344
the door just popped open.

18:31.378 --> 18:36.115
And I started to
fall out of the car

18:36.149 --> 18:38.285
because I remember I looked
down and I could see the road

18:38.318 --> 18:40.487
and rushing underneath me.

18:40.520 --> 18:45.192
And I was literally
like outside of the car.

18:45.225 --> 18:51.164
And all of a sudden, out of
nowhere, mom reached over

18:51.198 --> 18:53.766
and she grabbed me by the hair
and she pulled me back inside.

18:56.903 --> 19:01.241
And so if you feel like you're--

19:01.274 --> 19:07.380
like you're starting to
fall away, then you're not,

19:07.414 --> 19:10.082
because we're going to
pull you back inside.

19:18.725 --> 19:22.795
Oh my, you've
got quite a grip.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.365
I think you are stronger
than you're letting on.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.907
Hey there.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.909
You know, your mom and
I had a pretty cool

19:36.943 --> 19:39.011
aunt when we were growing up.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.413
And I hope I can be
the same for you.

19:55.828 --> 19:59.332
I want to apologize to you
that the only thing I have even

19:59.366 --> 20:03.603
thought about were
ways to heal your body,

20:03.636 --> 20:06.739
because I know better.

20:06.773 --> 20:10.543
We're not bodies with souls.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.413
We are souls with bodies.

20:23.089 --> 20:31.197
Hey you, we really want
you to stay with us, OK?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.165
I mean, we got all
the generations

20:33.199 --> 20:35.201
of women in the family here.

20:38.605 --> 20:42.842

should be, Harris Conor Healy.
