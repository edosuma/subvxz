00:59.287 --> 01:01.118
Well, look who's up.

01:08.687 --> 01:12.316
<i>BO Y: It's my parents. I don't know,
they're just, like, really stupid.</i>

01:12.487 --> 01:14.762
<i>- May I ask how old you are?
- Fourteen.</i>

01:15.207 --> 01:17.277
Well, hang on, Jimmy.
Your parents are gonna be stupid

01:17.447 --> 01:19.244
for another seven years.

01:20.287 --> 01:22.118
<i>Whoa, seven years?</i>

01:22.327 --> 01:24.443
<i>That's, like, longer than
I'll be in high school.</i>

01:24.647 --> 01:27.036
I salute your optimism.

01:27.527 --> 01:29.006
We'll be right back after this.

01:30.367 --> 01:33.723
Oh, God, Roz. A teenager
who's embarrassed by his parents?

01:33.887 --> 01:36.640
Can't you come up with something
a little more challenging for me?

01:36.807 --> 01:39.275
It was either him or our
old pal Rudy, the crier.

01:39.447 --> 01:42.086
Rudy, the crier. He's been on
three times in the last month.

01:42.247 --> 01:45.239
You put him on again, he won't
be the only one who's crying.

01:45.487 --> 01:48.001
God, I'm in a dry spell.

01:48.167 --> 01:50.362
Where are the souls
of genuine torment?

01:50.567 --> 01:53.604
The people teetering on the brink
of genuine despair?

01:53.807 --> 01:57.277
Oh, they'll be back. The holidays
are just around the corner.

01:57.487 --> 01:58.886
Well, perhaps you're right.

01:59.047 --> 02:00.321
Oh, Roz.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.796
- I've a question I'd like to ask you.
- Shoot.

02:02.967 --> 02:07.006
Have you ever had a recurring dream
of an intimate nature about someone...

02:07.167 --> 02:09.442
Well, a coworker?

02:09.646 --> 02:11.922
- Oh, no, why'd you tell me?
- Oh, Roz.

02:12.087 --> 02:14.999
Now it's gonna be creepy every time
you look at me through the glass.

02:15.207 --> 02:16.640
Roz, not you!

02:17.087 --> 02:19.203
- Who was it then?
- I'm not gonna go into specifics.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.244
- Gina in accounting?
- I'm not gonna do this.

02:21.647 --> 02:24.525
- Oh, Sheila, the slow intern?
- Forget I even mentioned it.

02:25.167 --> 02:26.839
Knock, knock.

02:27.607 --> 02:29.086
Gil.

02:29.247 --> 02:31.317
Frasier, I've come to tempt you.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.040
Really?

02:33.967 --> 02:37.926
I am reviewing the new pastry chef
at Chez Shea. And I quote:

02:38.127 --> 02:40.004
"His amaretto ëclair is so sinful,

02:40.167 --> 02:43.762
it will send you scurrying to your
local padre for absolution."

02:46.047 --> 02:47.958
No, thank you, Gil.
I'm on a diet, you see.

02:48.167 --> 02:51.716
- Oh, come now, you know you want it.
- No, no, no, I really don't.

02:53.087 --> 02:55.157
Off you go. Bye-bye.

02:55.367 --> 02:56.846
- Oh, my God!
- What?

02:57.007 --> 02:58.520
- It was Gil!
- I never said that.

02:58.727 --> 03:00.240
- Then why are you blushing?
- Don't be ridiculous!

03:00.447 --> 03:01.960
- Your ears are turning red.
- I am not.

03:02.127 --> 03:03.879
You are.

03:07.647 --> 03:09.638
Still not blushing.

03:10.567 --> 03:13.035
<i>MAN [CRYING]:
Just lying there in the hospital bed,</i>

03:13.207 --> 03:15.323
<i>she lifted her head off the pillow,</i>

03:15.487 --> 03:21.278
<i>looked up and said, "I love you."
And then she was gone.</i>

03:21.447 --> 03:23.563
Rudy, stop crying.

03:25.287 --> 03:26.959
Now, we've gone over this before.

03:27.127 --> 03:29.880
What was our agreement
about sad movies?

03:32.127 --> 03:35.358
<i>- I shouldn't watch them.
- Exactly.</i>

03:35.807 --> 03:37.160
Now, go get a cool washcloth

03:37.327 --> 03:39.443
to try to bring down
the puffiness around your eyes,

03:39.607 --> 03:43.043
and please stay away
from sad or depressing things.

03:43.207 --> 03:46.438
<i>Which, at this moment, includes
listening to the Frasier Crane Show.</i>

03:47.567 --> 03:49.046
Well, let's shoot it to the news.

03:49.247 --> 03:52.922
That's it for today.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

03:53.407 --> 03:57.002
Oh, my God!
Well, close the record books.

03:57.167 --> 04:00.443
<i>That was just the dullest three hours in
the history of the Frasier Crane Show.</i>

04:00.607 --> 04:02.120
Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad.

04:02.287 --> 04:04.676
What about the woman who was so
concerned about her appearance

04:04.847 --> 04:07.680
- she wouldn't leave the house?
- That was a commercial!

04:08.287 --> 04:11.165
I believe Miss Clairol
solved the problem.

04:11.487 --> 04:13.637
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Roz.
Oh, Roz.

04:13.807 --> 04:16.196
About that dream I mentioned
to you earlier...

04:16.767 --> 04:19.041
It goes without saying,
I'd rather you didn't share that.

04:19.247 --> 04:22.398
- Oh, sure.
- Hi, dream boy.

04:23.767 --> 04:25.519
I hate you.

04:25.687 --> 04:27.359
Couldn't keep
your mouth shut, could you?

04:27.567 --> 04:29.637
Just when did you find
the time to spread the news?

04:29.847 --> 04:32.407
You don't think I was listening
to your show, do you?

04:34.327 --> 04:35.965
BULLDOG:
Coming through!

04:36.127 --> 04:38.004
Oh, doc, I gotta rub
this one in a little.

04:38.167 --> 04:40.158
All right, Bulldog, before
you start to ridicule me,

04:40.327 --> 04:42.045
yes, yes, I had a dream about Gil,

04:42.247 --> 04:45.922
and, yes, it did have some
erotic elements, but...

04:46.127 --> 04:48.322
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

04:48.527 --> 04:50.961
I do now. Whoa!

04:52.527 --> 04:53.801
Look, let's just forget it.

04:53.967 --> 04:55.878
What delightful jibe did you
have prepared for me?

04:56.087 --> 04:58.965
Oh, I was gonna tell you your show
today just broke the snooze-o-meter,

04:59.127 --> 05:02.403
but now I wanna hear about you
greasing Gil's cookie sheet.

05:04.207 --> 05:06.402
I'm on a bus to hell.

05:10.847 --> 05:13.486
So I returned to the dry cleaners
yet a third time.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.797
I hardly need to tell you
how the story ends.

05:16.007 --> 05:17.884
Just tell me when the story ends.

05:19.527 --> 05:22.200
Fine. They realigned
my pleats. The end.

05:22.367 --> 05:25.404
I'm sorry, Niles.
I'm just a bit distracted today.

05:25.567 --> 05:28.718
See, this morning a man
from my building,

05:28.887 --> 05:30.605
approached me with
an intriguing problem.

05:30.767 --> 05:33.156
Seems he's been having
a recurring dream.

05:33.327 --> 05:35.887
Please, that little gambit didn't work
when we were in knee socks.

05:36.087 --> 05:38.647
- What was your dream, Frasier?
- Oh, all right.

05:39.367 --> 05:43.246
It's been tormenting me. I haven't
been able to sleep in weeks now.

05:43.567 --> 05:47.845
It's a bit hazy, but it starts out
in a seedy motel room.

05:48.007 --> 05:49.759
- I'm naked.
- Interesting.

05:49.927 --> 05:53.363
Yes, well, I roll over
and discover on my forearm

05:53.527 --> 05:56.360
a tattoo with the word "chesty."

05:56.567 --> 05:59.400
- Interesting.
- Yes. And then the shower turns off.

05:59.607 --> 06:02.167
Out from the bathroom steps...

06:02.367 --> 06:03.641
...a man.

06:06.527 --> 06:07.960
All right, go ahead, let me have it.

06:08.727 --> 06:11.082
Are you saying that now,
or is that a quote from the dream?

06:13.807 --> 06:15.365
Please.

06:16.527 --> 06:19.087
We're too intelligent to waste time
on the obvious interpretation.

06:19.247 --> 06:22.398
Yes. But you must admit
it's rather intriguing.

06:22.567 --> 06:23.841
Would you stop?

06:24.047 --> 06:26.607
It's obviously screaming for
a Jungian interpretation.

06:26.767 --> 06:28.803
The sexuality in the dream
is surely symbolic

06:28.967 --> 06:31.083
of some deeper non-sexual conflict.

06:31.287 --> 06:34.882
- All right.
- Good afternoon, Frasier.

06:35.167 --> 06:37.044
- Gil.
- A little birdie tells me,

06:37.207 --> 06:39.880
I was featured in your midnight movie.

06:41.247 --> 06:42.600
Very clever. Off you go.

06:42.807 --> 06:44.365
Very well. See you tomorrow,

06:44.527 --> 06:47.360
or should I say,
see you in your dreams.

06:49.647 --> 06:51.478
In this dream of yours,
were there any cigars,

06:51.647 --> 06:54.161
bananas or short, blunt swords?

06:54.567 --> 06:58.037
Would you stop it?
I'm 43, a little late for latency.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.483
- You guys okay over here?
- We're fine.

07:00.647 --> 07:02.638
Well, you must be new here.

07:02.807 --> 07:04.843
I would've remembered such
a pretty face as yours.

07:05.047 --> 07:06.878
- You're overcompensating.
- Right.

07:07.087 --> 07:08.964
We're fine. Bye-bye.

07:11.007 --> 07:15.046
I'm just baffled by it. Gil Chesterton
explains "chesty," but little else.

07:15.247 --> 07:17.477
You should tackle this from
a free-association standpoint.

07:17.647 --> 07:20.286
- Oh, God. Must we?
- Focus on a detail in the motel room.

07:20.447 --> 07:22.358
What's the first thing
that pops into your mind?

07:22.967 --> 07:24.320
A crescent-shaped lamp.

07:24.487 --> 07:27.399
Perfect. A crescent-shaped lamp.
Run with that.

07:27.607 --> 07:29.040
Crescent. Moon.

07:29.207 --> 07:30.959
Daphne Moon. French maid.

07:31.127 --> 07:33.641
- Brass bed. Satin rope.
- Niles!

07:35.487 --> 07:38.320
- This is my dream.
- I was just showing you the process.

07:38.527 --> 07:40.563
You were three words away
from a cigarette.

07:42.007 --> 07:43.804
- Your turn.
- All right.

07:43.967 --> 07:46.720
- Crescent lamp.
- Crescent.

07:47.207 --> 07:48.481
Croissant.

07:48.647 --> 07:51.719
Butter. Apricot jam.

07:52.087 --> 07:54.237
Hunger. Food. Diet.

07:54.647 --> 07:57.320
My God, I've been on a diet.
Do you think that's useful?

07:57.527 --> 07:59.677
You could stand to lose a few pounds.

08:00.967 --> 08:02.525
Just wait a minute.

08:03.167 --> 08:05.727
All right, Gil is a restaurant critic.
He's a gourmet.

08:05.887 --> 08:08.162
Perhaps he's symbolic of the food
I've been denying myself.

08:08.327 --> 08:09.760
That would explain why you're naked.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.162
It's when we're most
self-conscious about our bodies.

08:12.367 --> 08:15.245
Yes, and most vulnerable
to the way society tattoos us,

08:15.407 --> 08:18.285
with labels about our appearance.
Oh, my God, that's it, Niles.

08:18.447 --> 08:21.564
The dream is simply telling me that
I've been too rigid about my diet.

08:21.727 --> 08:24.002
You'll know tonight.
If this is the correct interpretation,

08:24.167 --> 08:27.079
the conflict will have passed from your
unconscious to your conscious mind.

08:27.287 --> 08:29.084
Yes. The dream will have
served its purpose.

08:29.287 --> 08:32.518
- And you'll no longer be plagued by it.
- Oh, God. I've nailed it. I really have.

08:32.727 --> 08:34.284
Finally, for the first time in weeks,

08:34.486 --> 08:39.241
there'll be no tequila bottles, no tattoo,
no half-naked man in my bed.

You're just being paranoid.

I'm telling you, they're on to me.

you after all that plastic surgery.

Marlena got sloppy. She never
should've gone back to Zürich.

Yeah, you're right.
We won't do it anymore.

10:30.447 --> 10:32.802
They never check the wooden leg.

The answer has got to be
in there somewhere.

Here's something. "Dreams
as an expression of wish-fulfilment."

- What are you working on?
- Nothing.

I'm helping Frasier interpret
a dream he's been having.

10:51.767 --> 10:54.076
You know, maybe Dad can help.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.561
No, no, no. No, no, no.

10:55.727 --> 10:58.446
Don't want to bore Dad with the
details of this particular dream.

10:58.647 --> 11:00.558
Dreams can be rooted
in childhood experience.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.439
Maybe Dad remembers
something you repressed.

11:02.607 --> 11:04.677
Gee, I don't know.
If it's about when you were a kid,

11:04.847 --> 11:06.724
I've repressed a lot of that myself.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.520
This is not a dream I wish to share
with Dad, thank you very much.

11:10.687 --> 11:12.325
We've exhausted every
other interpretation,

11:12.487 --> 11:14.637
so I guess it's back
to dreams as wish-fulfilment.

11:14.847 --> 11:17.645
Oh, Dad, would you mind
listening to my dream

11:17.807 --> 11:20.002
to see if it conjures up
any memories from my childhood?

11:20.167 --> 11:21.998
Oh, come on, you're making
too much out of this.

11:22.167 --> 11:23.566
It's a dream. Dreams are weird.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.600
Okay, please, Dad, I wouldn't ask
if it weren't really bothering me.

11:26.807 --> 11:28.638
- Oh, all right. Go on.
- All right now.

11:28.847 --> 11:30.838
It starts out in a little motel room.

11:31.007 --> 11:33.885
I have a tattoo on my arm, "chesty."

11:34.087 --> 11:36.317

11:36.527 --> 11:38.802
Yes, but then out
from the bathroom steps a...

11:38.967 --> 11:40.241
All right, now before I continue,

11:40.407 --> 11:43.763
just let me remind you that this is a
dream, not to be confused with reality.

a home run in the World Series,

12:04.367 --> 12:06.483
or you're in the jungle
with Jayne Mansfield

12:06.647 --> 12:09.241

- Thank you, Dad.

- Yes, Dad.

There's no reason to feel

We've all had dreams like that.

12:29.247 --> 12:32.364
I had one about a girl I shared
a flat with once. A gymnast.

Go on, Daphne.
This could be significant.

12:35.247 --> 12:39.798
Well, I remember we were doing
stretches in the gymnasium,

12:40.007 --> 12:42.123
when suddenly we decided
to take off all our clothes

12:42.287 --> 12:45.199
and go for a bounce
on the trampoline.

12:45.407 --> 12:48.126
The next thing you know, I'm chasing
her around the pommel horse and...

12:48.287 --> 12:49.561
Oh, never mind.

12:49.767 --> 12:51.678
Don't stop now.

12:53.847 --> 12:55.724

who was in the shower? Gil.

What do fish have? Gills.

Do you see where I'm going?

13:20.167 --> 13:21.680
Insane.

13:22.887 --> 13:26.118
It could be a dream about the loss
of a beloved childhood pet.

13:26.327 --> 13:29.717
Thanks a lot, Eddie. Forty-five minutes
in the park, you don't have to go.

13:29.887 --> 13:32.481
I get one bite into my sandwich,
and you give me the look.

13:32.647 --> 13:35.639
Mr Crane, did Dr Crane
ever have a goldfish growing up?

13:35.807 --> 13:37.240
- A fish?
- Yes, as a pet.

That was Hester's department.

what I'm thinking?

That Dad can interpret
the looks from his dog

13:46.047 --> 13:48.925

Hesty. The tattoo. That's only
one letter away from chesty.

13:55.327 --> 13:58.399

could have been about Mother?

13:58.607 --> 13:59.881
Well?

14:00.047 --> 14:01.719
I suppose I could've
misread the tattoo.

14:01.887 --> 14:05.562
Yes, this freckle pattern here on my
arm could be mistaken for a C.

14:05.767 --> 14:08.565

All right, all right. I'll go.

Well, so, the tattoo
could've said "Hesty."

14:16.927 --> 14:19.441
But the problem is I don't ever
remember Dad calling Mom that.

- Any pet name?

14:32.927 --> 14:34.440
A term of endearment?

14:34.607 --> 14:38.680
Well, when we were first married,
I used to call her "honey."

14:38.847 --> 14:41.759
And then there was a time after that
that I started calling her "sweetie."

14:42.127 --> 14:45.039
I'm sure there's a delicious anecdote
behind each one of those,

14:45.207 --> 14:48.244
but did you ever call her Hesty?

14:48.447 --> 14:51.245

I must have heard him
call her Hesty once,
