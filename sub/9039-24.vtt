WEBVTT

00:03.933 --> 00:05.200
- THIS IS NICE, ISN'T IT?

00:05.200 --> 00:06.700
- IT'S WONDERFUL.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.733
- WHERE THE GUY
WITH THE WATER ALREADY?

00:08.733 --> 00:11.167
I'M DYING HERE.

00:11.167 --> 00:14.433
- GOOD, BEFORE YOU GO,
WOULD YOU MAKE A TOAST?

00:16.000 --> 00:19.433
- OKAY, HERE'S TO WATER.

00:19.433 --> 00:21.733
THE EARTH IS COVERED WITH IT.

00:22.933 --> 00:26.167
WHERE THE HELL IS MY SHARE?

00:26.167 --> 00:27.933
- RAYMOND, PLEASE MAKE A TOAST.

00:27.933 --> 00:34.100
- ALL RIGHT, HERE'S TO ROBERT
BEING BACK ON THE JOB.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.800
WE ALL THINK IT'S GREAT.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.100
WAY TO GO.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.900
WAY TO GO.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.900
[glasses clinking]

00:42.900 --> 00:44.833
- CHEERS.
- THERE YOU GO.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.900
- ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.267
- THANK YOU.

00:48.267 --> 00:49.967
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL
NIGHT FOR ME.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.233
I FINALLY FEEL LIKE

00:51.233 --> 00:53.633
I'VE PUT MY BULL WOUND
BEHIND ME.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.933
I SAID "BEHIND ME."

00:57.933 --> 01:01.033
[laughter]

01:01.033 --> 01:02.433
NO, BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU,

01:02.433 --> 01:03.867
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH
FEW MONTHS

01:03.867 --> 01:05.200
GETTING BACK ON MY FEET,

01:05.200 --> 01:06.867
AND NOW THAT I HAVE
AMY AT MY SIDE AGAIN

01:06.867 --> 01:09.333
AND I'M BACK DOING
THE JOB THAT I LOVE,

01:09.333 --> 01:10.800
I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.333
AND ALSO, I THINK
I HAVE GOTTEN OVER MY ANXIETY

01:14.333 --> 01:16.333
VIS-A-VIS
PUBLIC RESTROOMS.

01:16.333 --> 01:20.233
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I SHALL RETURN PRESENTLY.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.400
- OH, MY GOD.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.033
- IT'S THAT AWFUL WOMAN.

01:26.033 --> 01:27.200
- THAT'S DEFINITELY HER,
RIGHT?

01:27.200 --> 01:29.567
- IT'S HER.
- WHO?

01:29.567 --> 01:32.067
- THAT'S JOANNE,
ROBERT'S EX-WIFE.

01:32.067 --> 01:34.300
- [spits]

01:37.167 --> 01:38.167
- WHAT THE HELL?

01:38.167 --> 01:40.133
SHE'S GOT WATER!

01:44.700 --> 01:48.033
- OH, MY GOD.
SO THAT'S ROBERT'S EX-WIFE?

01:48.033 --> 01:50.067
- YEP, THE INFAMOUS
JOANNE.

01:50.067 --> 01:52.000
- [spits]

01:52.933 --> 01:55.667
- MOM, STUFF'S COMING OUT.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.567
- I ALMOST DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE HER

02:00.567 --> 02:04.133
WITHOUT HER BROOMSTICK
AND FLYING MONKEYS.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.233
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
ROBERT SAW HER?

02:08.233 --> 02:09.700
- OH, NOT SINCE
THE DIVORCE WAS FINALIZED.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.400
- WHAT, YOU DON'T KNOW
THE STORY, AMY?

02:11.400 --> 02:13.567
- NO, HE NEVER
TALKS ABOUT HER.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.633
- THAT'S 'CAUSE
HE'S A NICE BOY.

02:16.633 --> 02:17.900
- I'LL TELL YOU.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.333
- GO AHEAD.

02:19.333 --> 02:21.700
- OKAY.
MA, NO SPITTING.

02:21.700 --> 02:25.167
UH, LET'S SEE; WELL,
WE HAD JUST MOVED IN

02:25.167 --> 02:27.733
ACROSS THE STREET
FROM MY PARENTS, RIGHT?

02:27.733 --> 02:31.233
- I DON'T REMEMBER.
I'VE BLOCKED THAT OUT.

02:31.233 --> 02:32.933
- WELL, THAT'S WHEN IT WAS,

02:32.933 --> 02:34.233
'CAUSE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT TIME,

02:34.233 --> 02:38.400
ROBERT AND JOANNE,
THEY HAD A LITTLE HOUSE.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.700
- NO, NO, I'M SERIOUS.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.467
I'M PUTTING THE MOVIE
IN MY TOP FIVE ALL-TIME.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.667
- ANY MOVIE WITH A COP
OR A DOG IN IT

02:45.667 --> 02:46.767
GOES IN YOUR TOP FIVE.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.233
- AND THIS ONE HAD BOTH.

02:52.233 --> 02:54.333
HEY, REMEMBER WHEN
THE DOG CLEANED HIMSELF

02:54.333 --> 02:55.800
IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.733
- THAT WAS FUNNY.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT ONE.

02:57.733 --> 03:00.267
- YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKED BEST
ABOUT THAT MOVIE?

03:00.267 --> 03:02.300
WE HAD TO LEAVE
OUR HOUSE TO SEE IT.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.900
I MEAN, THIS IS
THE FIRST MOVIE WE'VE SEEN

03:03.900 --> 03:05.300
SINCE WE HAD THE TWINS.

03:05.300 --> 03:08.367
- HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHOSE EGG DIVIDED.

03:08.367 --> 03:09.833
- HEY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:09.833 --> 03:11.833
YOUR MOTHER TOLD ME
THEY WOULD BABYSIT THE KIDS

03:11.833 --> 03:12.933
WHENEVER WE WANTED.

03:12.933 --> 03:14.233
IT IS JUST SO GREAT

03:14.233 --> 03:18.167
THAT WE MOVED ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THEM.

03:18.167 --> 03:20.167
HEY, JOANNE.
- HEY, SWEETHEART.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.967
- HEY, GUYS.
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

03:21.967 --> 03:25.133
- HOW WAS THE MOVIE?

03:25.133 --> 03:26.800
- OH, I'M TELLING YOU.
I WISH YOU'D COME WITH US.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.167
I REALLY LIKED IT.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.700
I'M THINKING OF
PUTTING IT IN MY TOP FIVE.

03:29.700 --> 03:33.000
- REALLY? BECAUSE THE PREVIEW
LOOKED KIND OF STUPID.

03:35.667 --> 03:38.067
- YOU KNOW, NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT,

03:38.067 --> 03:39.867
YOU KNOW,
THE DOG DROVE A CAR.

03:39.867 --> 03:41.467
WHAT IS THAT?

03:43.333 --> 03:45.133
- THAT'S WHY WE CAN NEVER
SEE MOVIES TOGETHER.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.433
WE HAVE THE EXACT
OPPOSITE TASTE

03:46.433 --> 03:48.733
IN MOVIES, BOOKS--
STOP--

03:48.733 --> 03:50.233
MUSIC, TV SHOWS.

03:50.233 --> 03:51.533
HE LIKES
THE KIND OF THING

03:51.533 --> 03:53.433
WHERE SOMEONE
STEPS ON A RAKE.

03:53.433 --> 03:54.833
- YEAH. THIS MOVIE
HAD THAT TOO.

03:54.833 --> 03:56.167
- YEAH, RIGHT.

04:01.933 --> 04:03.267
- OH, NO, NO. NO.

04:03.267 --> 04:04.767
YOU CAN PUT YOUR FEET
ON OUR FURNITURE.

04:04.767 --> 04:06.233
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M OKAY. I'M GOOD.

04:06.233 --> 04:07.500
I'M GOOD RIGHT HERE.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.600
- NO, REALLY,
IT'S--IT'S OKAY.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.233
UNTIL ROBERT
GETS A RAISE,

04:10.233 --> 04:13.733
WE ARE BLESSED WITH
YOUR PARENTS' OLD STUFF.

04:13.733 --> 04:15.033
IF YOU GET REALLY CLOSE,

04:15.033 --> 04:18.600
YOU CAN STILL
SMELL FRANK'S FEET.

04:19.667 --> 04:21.700
- I'LL PASS.

04:21.700 --> 04:24.167
- [laughing]

04:25.567 --> 04:27.433
SORRY?

04:27.433 --> 04:29.500
- I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T
DOING THAT ANYMORE.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.733
NO CRAZY CHIN.

04:30.733 --> 04:32.133
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:32.133 --> 04:33.367
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
WHEN I EAT,

04:33.367 --> 04:34.900
I DO A LITTLE THING
WITH MY CHIN.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.033
- OH, I DIDN'T KNOW.
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

04:38.033 --> 04:40.833
- SO, DEBRA, YOUR HAIR
IS LOOKING GOOD.

04:40.833 --> 04:41.900
- OH, THANK YOU.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.767
- IT'S NOT AS UGH AS IT WAS

04:43.767 --> 04:46.667
WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.133
- THANK YOU.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.533
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:49.533 --> 04:50.933
- I'M RUBBING
YOUR SHOULDERS.

04:50.933 --> 04:52.700
- WHY?

04:52.700 --> 04:55.833
- I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE MY MUSH-MUSH?

04:55.833 --> 04:57.067
- IT'S OKAY.

04:57.067 --> 04:59.500
- I'M SORRY.
WAS I HURTING YOU?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.200
SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW
MY OWN STRENGTH.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.667
- YOU AND YOUR BIG MITTS.

05:02.667 --> 05:06.200
THAT'S WHY
WE CAN'T HAVE PETS.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.600
[polite laughter]

05:07.600 --> 05:09.767
- MY FUNNY LADY.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.933
LOOK OUT
FOR MR. BIG HANDS.

05:12.933 --> 05:15.600
- OKAY, I'M GOING TO BED.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.400
- ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL KEEP IT DOWN OUT HERE.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.700
- OH, DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.233
GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.
ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.400
BOBBY, TONIGHT
COULD YOU NOT PLOP INTO BED?

05:23.400 --> 05:26.167
SOMETIMES I WAKE UP
IN MIDAIR.

05:26.167 --> 05:28.700
- OKAY, YOU GOT IT.
NO PLOPPING.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.500
NIGHT,
MUSHY-MUSH-MUSH.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.433
[slams door]

05:38.500 --> 05:40.033
- SO, ROBERT,
I LOVE WHAT YOU GUYS--

05:40.033 --> 05:41.767
- NO, NO, SERIOUSLY,
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP IT DOWN.

05:50.733 --> 05:57.067
- [yawning]

05:57.067 --> 05:59.233
- AH.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.067
WHOO.

06:04.067 --> 06:06.000
WHOO, BOY.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.000
I AM TUCKERED OUT.

06:12.533 --> 06:15.533
- YOU GUYS WANT TO PLAY
MONOPOLY OR SOMETHING?

06:16.533 --> 06:18.433
- SHOULDN'T YOU
BE GETTING HOME?

06:18.433 --> 06:19.800
- WELL, I REALLY
HAVE TO MAKE SURE

06:19.800 --> 06:21.600
THAT JOANNE IS IN A REAL
DEEP SLEEP, YOU KNOW,

06:21.600 --> 06:26.533
'CAUSE I KIND OF HAVE
THE TENDENCY TO PLOP INTO BED.

06:26.533 --> 06:31.100
- YEAH, MUSH-MUSH
TOLD US.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.800
- HEY, I KNOW.
HOW ABOUT PICTIONARY?

06:32.800 --> 06:34.300
I'LL GET A SKETCH PAD.

06:38.433 --> 06:40.667
- OH, DON'T YOU FEEL BAD
FOR ROBERT?

06:40.667 --> 06:43.033
- I-I FEEL BAD FOR YOU,
'CAUSE I'M GOING TO BED.

06:43.033 --> 06:47.233
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT.

06:47.233 --> 06:49.433
LISTEN, YOU'VE GOT
TO TALK TO ROBERT.

06:49.433 --> 06:52.267
HE'S SO UNHAPPY
WITH JOANNE.

06:52.267 --> 06:53.667
- HE'S NOT UNHAPPY.
WHAT?

06:53.667 --> 06:55.367
SO SHE'S A LITTLE BOSSY,
ALL RIGHT?

06:55.367 --> 06:56.633
HE SEEMS
FINE WITH THAT.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.133
- SHE'S ALWAYS
PUTTING HIM DOWN,

06:58.133 --> 07:00.133
AND HE JUST SITS THERE
AND TAKES IT.

07:00.133 --> 07:02.167
- HEY, THAT'S MARRIAGE.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.233
THEIR MARRIAGE.

07:05.233 --> 07:07.633
THAT'S THEIR MARRIAGE
OVER THERE.

07:07.633 --> 07:10.233
- JUST TELL HIM THAT
HE SHOULD TALK TO JOANNE

07:10.233 --> 07:11.300
ABOUT THE WAY
SHE TREATS HIM

07:11.300 --> 07:12.733
AND HOW THAT
MAKES HIM FEEL.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.467
- HOW ABOUT I'LL JUST
TELL HIM TO GO HOME,

07:14.467 --> 07:19.067
AND THEN YOU AND I CAN GO
UPSTAIRS AND SHAKE IT UP?

07:24.633 --> 07:27.300
- IF YOU DON'T TALK
TO HIM, I WILL.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.500
- NO, DON'T, NO.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.433
I'LL TALK TO HIM,
OKAY?

07:31.433 --> 07:33.300
I KNOW--I KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.500
- FOUND A DECK OF CARDS.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.467
CRAZY 8s.

07:38.567 --> 07:41.267
- LISTEN, ROBERT.

07:41.267 --> 07:43.867
YOU REALLY, REALLY
SHOULD GO HOME

07:43.867 --> 07:46.467
TO YOUR WIFE, 'CAUSE...

07:46.467 --> 07:49.133
DEBRA'S GOT TO PUMP
BREAST MILK.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.900
- YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

07:56.900 --> 07:59.100
I DON'T HAVE TO PUMP,
ROBERT.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.700
IT'S JUST THAT, UM...

08:00.700 --> 08:03.767
YOU AND JOANNE--I MEAN,
WE THINK JOANNE IS GREAT.

08:03.767 --> 08:07.333
UH, BUT JUST SOMETIMES,
YOU KNOW, WITH YOU,

08:07.333 --> 08:08.967
SHE CAN BE
NOT VERY NICE.

08:08.967 --> 08:11.933
AND, UM, WE WERE JUST THINKING
THAT IT WOULD HELP YOU

08:11.933 --> 08:13.167
IF YOU TOLD HER--

08:13.167 --> 08:15.200
ROBERT, STOP LOOKING
AT MY BREASTS.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.467
- I'M SORRY.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.600
LISTEN, YOU KNOW,

08:27.600 --> 08:29.600
JOANNE HAS TO PUT UP
WITH A LOT FROM ME, YOU KNOW.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.533
I AM NOT THE EASIEST
PERSON TO LIVE WITH.

08:31.533 --> 08:33.733
I, UH, I'M HAIRY
AND SMELLY,

08:33.733 --> 08:37.433
AND I'M REALLY
KIND OF LIKE AN ANIMAL.

08:38.467 --> 08:42.600
- HI, DEARS.
- HEY, MARIE, HI.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.767
- I TOLD YOU TWO--
COME ON--

08:44.767 --> 08:46.900
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE
ANYMORE IF YOU DON'T KNOCK.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.200
- GOTCHA.

08:48.200 --> 08:51.200
HEY, YOUR OLD LADY'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.800
- JOANNE?

08:52.800 --> 08:55.100
- YEAH, SHE WAS A LITTLE SHORT
WITH ME ON THE PHONE.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.867
I THINK SHE'S WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

08:56.867 --> 08:59.000
- I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.100
- WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST BE HAPPY

09:00.100 --> 09:01.567
THAT ROBBIE
FOUND SOMEONE?

09:01.567 --> 09:03.467
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA LEARN
THAT IT'S NOT OUR PLACE

09:03.467 --> 09:05.333
TO MEDDLE
IN OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES?

09:05.333 --> 09:07.267
- BUT, MARIE,
I DON'T THINK IT'S MEDDLING

09:07.267 --> 09:10.067
IF YOU LOVE AND CARE
ABOUT THE PERSON.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.833
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JUST--

09:12.833 --> 09:14.767
YOU'RE JUST STROLLING DOWN
THE RAILROAD TRACKS,

09:14.767 --> 09:17.733
AND YOU DON'T HEAR
THE WHOO-WHOO!

09:25.600 --> 09:28.600
- ROBERT, I THINK WHAT
YOUR FATHER IS TRYING TO SAY

09:28.600 --> 09:30.900
IS THAT SOMETIMES
JOANNE IS--

09:30.900 --> 09:33.300
- A NUTCRACKER.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.033
- DAD, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY WIFE.

09:35.033 --> 09:38.000
- A NUTCRACKER.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.633
- ROBBIE,
YOU REALLY SHOULD--

09:41.633 --> 09:46.000
NO. NO.
I'M NOT BUTTING IN.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.600
LIVE YOUR LIFE.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.700
- ROBERT, YOU JUST
SEEM SO UNHAPPY.

09:55.700 --> 09:59.167
- WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF INTERVENTION?

09:59.167 --> 10:00.900
I HAPPEN
TO LOVE JOANNE.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.067
SHE'S--SHE'S STRONG.
SHE'S INDEPENDENT.

10:03.067 --> 10:04.833
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HER.

10:04.833 --> 10:08.900
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT
OUR...PRIVATE LIFE.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.133
WE HAVE CHEMISTRY.

10:14.067 --> 10:17.733
- I REMEMBER WHEN
YOU TOOK CHEMISTRY.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.200
THAT WAS THE YEAR
YOU HAD NO EYEBROWS.

10:27.267 --> 10:30.000
- I DON'T APPRECIATE THIS.
I REALLY DON'T.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.567
A FAMILY'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE LIKE THIS.

10:31.567 --> 10:33.167
IF NO ONE IS
GONNA SUPPORT ME,

10:33.167 --> 10:35.600
THEN I'D JUST RATHER
YOU ALL BUTT OUT.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.300
- WOW, HE REALLY
HATES THAT CHAIR.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.367
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:57.367 --> 10:58.800
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE STUDYING

10:58.800 --> 11:00.167
FOR YOUR SERGEANT'S EXAM.

11:00.167 --> 11:02.000
HOW ARE WE EVER GONNA AFFORD
ANYTHING NICE?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.067
THIS IS
HOW YOU STUDY.

11:09.267 --> 11:12.867
- I'M TAKING A CARTOON BREAK
AND EATING A BANANA.

11:12.867 --> 11:14.267
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.

11:14.267 --> 11:15.800
YOU'RE GONNA PUT IT OFF
TILL THE LAST MINUTE

11:15.800 --> 11:17.167
AND THEN GUESS WHAT--

11:17.167 --> 11:18.333
YOU'LL BE WATCHING CARTOONS
FULL-TIME

11:18.333 --> 11:21.367
AND COMING TO ME
FOR BANANA MONEY.

11:22.933 --> 11:26.100
[doorbell rings]

11:27.900 --> 11:30.133
YOU THINK YOU CAN
ANSWER THE DOOR?

11:38.733 --> 11:39.800
- HEY.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.333
- HEY.

11:45.233 --> 11:47.333
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:47.333 --> 11:50.033
- UM...

11:51.767 --> 11:53.567
WELL...

11:53.567 --> 11:55.900
I-I WANTED TO COME BY
AND APOLOGIZE

11:55.900 --> 11:57.333
FOR EVERYBODY YESTERDAY.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.567
- LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

11:58.567 --> 12:01.333
NONE OF YOU KNOW HER
THE WAY I DO.

12:01.333 --> 12:04.500
- YEAH, YEAH. I KNOW;
CHEMISTRY,

12:04.500 --> 12:09.033
BUT, UM...
I GOTTA TELL YOU.

12:09.033 --> 12:11.600
I DID JUST KIND OF OVERHEAR

12:11.600 --> 12:14.700
ABOUT THE BANANA MONEY.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.900
- BOBBY, IF YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GET--

12:18.900 --> 12:20.633
OH. HEY, RAY.

12:20.633 --> 12:22.600
- HEY. HI, JOANNE.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.100
- UH, BOBBY DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE COMING OVER.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.867
- OH, THAT'S 'CAUSE BOBBY
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW, YOU KNOW?

12:27.867 --> 12:30.233
IT'S A SURPRISE.

12:32.167 --> 12:33.333
- OH, YOU KNOW
HOW WE LOVE IT

12:33.333 --> 12:34.600
WHEN YOU
COME OVER, RAY,

12:34.600 --> 12:36.967
BUT BOBBY'S GOT
A LOT OF STUDYING TO DO,

12:36.967 --> 12:41.000
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE NOT
THE BEST INFLUENCE ON HIM.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.067
- OH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.633
- RAY, WAIT.

12:47.533 --> 12:50.233
DON'T TALK TO HIM
LIKE THAT.

12:50.233 --> 12:52.700
- EXCUSE ME?

12:52.700 --> 12:53.733
- IT'S OKAY, ROBERT.

12:53.733 --> 12:54.933
- NO, NO. IT'S NOT OKAY.

12:54.933 --> 12:56.133
I WANT YOU TO APOLOGIZE
TO RAYMOND.

12:56.133 --> 12:57.567
- APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT?

12:57.567 --> 12:59.433
- FOR WHAT YOU JUST
SAID TO HIM

12:59.433 --> 13:01.300
AND FOR ALL THE MEAN THINGS
YOU'VE EVER SAID ABOUT HIM.

13:01.300 --> 13:05.633
- SHE SAYS MEAN THINGS
ABOUT ME?

13:05.633 --> 13:07.567
- OH, SURE, SURE,
SHE'S SWEET TO YOUR FACE,

13:07.567 --> 13:08.867
BUT AS SOON
AS YOU LEAVE,

13:08.867 --> 13:10.100
SHE TALKS ABOUT
HOW YOUR VOICE

13:10.100 --> 13:12.833
SOUNDS LIKE
A WOUNDED COW

13:12.833 --> 13:14.667
OR HOW WHEN YOU RUN,
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING

13:14.667 --> 13:18.600
TO HOLD A PENCIL
BETWEEN YOUR CHEEKS.

13:24.033 --> 13:26.367
- HMM.

13:26.367 --> 13:28.100
- I'M TIRED OF THE WAY
YOU TREAT HIM.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.533
HE'S MY BROTHER.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.167
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE, JOANNE.

13:31.167 --> 13:33.167
MAYBE IF YOU JUST SHOWED
A LITTLE WARMTH TO PEOPLE,

13:33.167 --> 13:35.233
THEY WOULDN'T BE
SO SCARED OF YOU.

13:35.233 --> 13:36.600
AND MAYBE IF YOU JUST
GAVE ME A CLUE

13:36.600 --> 13:37.967
THAT YOU STILL
CARED ABOUT ME,

13:37.967 --> 13:39.200
I WOULDN'T SPEND
SO MUCH TIME

13:39.200 --> 13:40.633
HIDING OUT
AT RAY AND DEBRA'S.

13:40.633 --> 13:42.367
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW
SOMETHING ELSE?

13:42.367 --> 13:46.233
THINGS ARE GONNA HAVE TO START
CHANGING AROUND HERE.

13:48.300 --> 13:50.033
- I WANT A DIVORCE.

14:01.367 --> 14:02.167
- WHAT?

14:02.167 --> 14:04.167
- AH, THAT FELT GOOD.

14:04.167 --> 14:05.733
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

14:05.733 --> 14:07.667
THANK YOU.

14:07.667 --> 14:10.133
[doorbell rings]

14:10.133 --> 14:13.367
- I'LL GET THAT.

14:13.367 --> 14:14.733
- I'M GLAD WE TALKED.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.400
HOW MUCH TIME
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED

14:16.400 --> 14:18.100
TO GET YOUR STUFF
OUT OF THE HOUSE?

14:18.100 --> 14:19.467
- HELLO, RAYMOND.
- HI, MA. UH, LISTEN,

14:19.467 --> 14:20.800
COULD YOU DRIVE ME
TO THE MALL?

14:20.800 --> 14:22.267
'CAUSE I COULD REALLY USE
A SWEATER.

14:22.267 --> 14:23.267
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

14:23.267 --> 14:24.267
- WE'LL GO SATURDAY.

14:24.267 --> 14:25.600
- NO, NO, NO.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.500
- OH, HELLO, JOANNE.
HOW NICE TO SEE YOU.

14:28.500 --> 14:33.733
ROBBIE, I MADE YOU
A BUNDT CAKE.

14:33.733 --> 14:35.733
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:36.800 --> 14:39.733
- JOANNE JUST...DUMPED ME.

14:42.267 --> 14:44.967
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.367
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, MA?

14:46.367 --> 14:47.800
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
IN THE CAR, OKAY?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.333
IT'S KIND OF CHILLY.
I COULD REALLY USE--

14:49.333 --> 14:51.100
- JOANNE DUMPED YOU?
- I WANT A SWEATER!

14:51.100 --> 14:54.200
- JOANNE DUMPED YOU?

15:07.367 --> 15:09.000
YOU.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.500
YOU.

15:11.500 --> 15:15.633
YOU NEVER APPRECIATED
MY ROBBIE.

15:15.633 --> 15:16.700
- I COULD USE A SWEATER.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.567
- YOU NEVER LOVED HIM

15:18.567 --> 15:21.733
FOR THE DECENT,
DELIGHTFUL BOY HE IS.

15:21.733 --> 15:25.167
YOU NEVER REALIZED
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE

15:25.167 --> 15:28.500
TO BE A PART
OF THIS WONDERFUL FAMILY.

15:28.500 --> 15:32.600
I HAVE HELD MY TONGUE
FOR TWO YEARS,

15:32.600 --> 15:33.533
AND I HAVE GIVEN YOU

15:33.533 --> 15:35.233
EVERY BENEFIT
OF THE DOUBT.

15:35.233 --> 15:40.000
THAT'S THE KIND
OF PERSON I AM.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.700
- THE KIND OF PERSON
YOU ARE.

15:42.700 --> 15:48.100
YOU'RE AN ANGRY, PUSHY,
MANIPULATIVE BITCH.

15:48.100 --> 15:51.800
- OH! NO! NO!
RAYMOND, NO!

15:51.800 --> 15:52.833
- STOP! STOP!

15:52.833 --> 15:55.067
- RAYMOND, NO!

15:55.067 --> 15:57.700
YOU MONSTER!
YOU MONSTER, YOU.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.300
N--NO, YOU'RE NOT
A MONSTER.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.867
YOU'RE A CREATURE.

16:00.867 --> 16:02.867
- I'M NOT THE ONE BEING
RESTRAINED RIGHT NOW.

16:02.867 --> 16:07.067
- AND I'M NOT THE ONE WHO DANCED
TOPLESS IN ATLANTIC CITY.

16:16.467 --> 16:22.467
THAT'S RIGHT.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU...

16:22.467 --> 16:24.700
CINNAMON.

16:26.467 --> 16:29.433
BUT AS LONG
AS MY SON SEEMED HAPPY,

16:29.433 --> 16:33.033
I DECIDED TO LET HIM LIVE
IN BLISSFUL IGNORANCE.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.167
- I KNEW SHE WAS A SHOWGIRL, MA.

16:37.167 --> 16:38.500
- YOU KNEW?

16:38.500 --> 16:41.200
YOU KNEW THIS,
AND YOU STILL MARRIED HER?

16:41.200 --> 16:44.067
- YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

16:47.633 --> 16:49.600
COULD HAVE SAVED MONEY
ON THE BACHELOR PARTY.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.233
- OH, COME ON.
ENOUGH, ENOUGH.

16:51.233 --> 16:52.333
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR

16:52.333 --> 16:56.067
THIS KIND OF THING ANYMORE.

16:56.067 --> 16:59.000
SOMEONE HAS TO PROTECT
THIS FAMILY,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.600
AND I'M THROUGH
SITTING IDLY BY.

17:02.967 --> 17:05.100
AND AS FOR YOU...

17:08.667 --> 17:11.367
NOBODY DUMPS MY SON.

17:11.367 --> 17:14.100
YOU THINK
YOU'RE DUMPING MY SON?

17:14.100 --> 17:15.500
- OKAY, LET'S CALM DOWN.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.200
- OH, YEAH, WELL,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

17:17.200 --> 17:20.233
MY SON IS DUMPING YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:20.233 --> 17:23.133
IT'S TIME TO TAKE OUT
THE TRASH.

17:35.867 --> 17:37.200
- THREE MINUTES AGO,

17:37.200 --> 17:40.167
I WAS WATCHING CARTOONS
AND EATING A BANANA.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.033
SHE STILL THERE?

17:48.033 --> 17:49.667
- NO.
WHAT'S SCARY IS,

17:49.667 --> 17:52.767
I THINK
I JUST SAW A BAT FLY AWAY.

18:01.267 --> 18:04.533
- YOU KNEW
SHE WAS A SHOWGIRL?

18:04.533 --> 18:06.533
RAYMOND, I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT KEEPING

18:06.533 --> 18:08.400
THIS KIND OF A SECRET
ABOUT DEBRA.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.667
- YOU MEAN PEPPERMINT?

18:19.233 --> 18:21.600
- I DON'T LIKE THAT,
RAYMOND.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.267
THANK GOD I LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET FROM YOU.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.867
AND NOW...

18:28.867 --> 18:32.533
WE ALL NEED TO HAVE
A PIECE OF THIS CAKE.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.167
- WHAT DO I DO NOW?

18:41.267 --> 18:43.600
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU DON'T DO.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.567
YOU DON'T CALL MOM
A BITCH.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.233
- OH, MY GOD.

18:57.233 --> 18:59.367
- I USUALLY
DON'T GET THAT WAY,

18:59.367 --> 19:03.000
BUT YOU KNOW HOW STRONG
MATERNAL INSTINCTS ARE.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.633
- YEAH, I KNOW.

19:04.633 --> 19:08.500
IT STILL HURTS
WHEN IT RAINS.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.767
- SHH, SHH, SHH.
HERE HE COMES.

19:13.133 --> 19:14.767
- OH, MY GOD.

19:14.767 --> 19:16.800
DID YOU SEE
WHO'S SITTING OVER THERE?

19:16.800 --> 19:17.933
JOANNE.

19:17.933 --> 19:20.033
- GET OUTTA HERE.
- SHE IS?

19:20.033 --> 19:23.200
- HUH.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.700
- DO YOU THINK SHE SAW ME?

19:24.700 --> 19:26.067
SHOULD I GO SAY HI?

19:26.067 --> 19:27.767
- NO, NO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.167
- WHAT? SHE'S
A HORRIBLE PERSON.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.367
- SHE'S A CREATURE.

19:30.367 --> 19:31.400
- HI.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.867
- HEY, JOANNE.
- HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

19:33.867 --> 19:36.467
- HELLO, BARONES.
HI, BOBBY.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.467
- HI.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.900
- OH, WHAT A PLEASANT
SURPRISE.

19:40.900 --> 19:44.567
- OH, HOW HAVE
YOU BEEN?

19:46.400 --> 19:50.033
- YEAH.
THANKS, GOOD.

19:50.033 --> 19:51.400
YEAH.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.533
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

19:53.933 --> 19:55.567
OW. WHAT?

19:55.567 --> 19:57.833
OH, AMY, MY GIRLFRIEND,
MY GIRLFRIEND AMY.

19:57.833 --> 19:59.633
- OH, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HI.

19:59.633 --> 20:03.067
- QUITE A GRIP
YOU GOT THERE.

20:04.467 --> 20:05.667
SO, UM...

20:05.667 --> 20:07.233
WELL, I GUESS
I'D BETTER BE GETTING BACK

20:07.233 --> 20:08.267
TO MY TABLE THERE.

20:08.267 --> 20:09.733
- SURE, SURE, YEAH.

20:09.733 --> 20:11.833
- UH, LISTEN. UM...

20:11.833 --> 20:13.167
NOW THAT
I'M BACK IN TOWN,

20:13.167 --> 20:15.900
IT MIGHT BE FUN TO CATCH UP
IF YOU WANT.

20:15.900 --> 20:19.167
UM, HERE'S MY NUMBER.

20:19.167 --> 20:23.367
UH, SO, UH,
IT WAS REALLY GOOD

20:23.367 --> 20:24.767
TO SEE ALL OF YOU AGAIN.

20:24.767 --> 20:26.300
- YOU TOO.
TAKE CARE.

20:26.300 --> 20:29.400
- IT WAS A REALLY
NICE SURPRISE.

20:34.633 --> 20:35.733
- [chuckles]

20:35.733 --> 20:37.100
- WHAT?

20:37.100 --> 20:40.967
- SHE WENT BACK
TO HER MAIDEN NAME, GLOTZ.

20:40.967 --> 20:44.433
- CINNAMON GLOTZ?

20:46.000 --> 20:49.367
- JOANNE,
JOANNE GLOTZ.

20:50.300 --> 20:53.367
BIGGEST MISTAKE
OF MY LIFE.

20:53.367 --> 20:56.233
- IT COULD BE WORSE, ROBERT.

20:56.233 --> 20:59.600
SOME MISTAKES
LAST 43 YEARS.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.167
I DON'T SEE WHAT'S WRONG
WITH ITEMIZING THE BILL

21:08.167 --> 21:09.700
SO WE EACH PAY
FOR WHAT WE ATE.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.900
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
IT'S JUST EASIER

21:10.900 --> 21:12.333
TO SPLIT IT UP EQUALLY, DAD.

21:12.333 --> 21:16.133
- YES, EASIER FOR
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAD APPETIZERS.

21:17.833 --> 21:20.100
- HEY, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.467
I WANT TO CHECK DAD'S TIP.

21:21.467 --> 21:23.667
- YOU DON'T TIP
ON THE TAX OR THE LIQUOR.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.300
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.667
GET IN THE CAR.
YOU'RE DRUNK.
