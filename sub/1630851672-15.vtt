You found her?

53:15.208 --> 53:16.165
She walkied you
to help me.

53:16.296 --> 53:18.123
You walkied us,
Alicia.

53:18.254 --> 53:19.908
One by one,
the characters decide

53:20.038 --> 53:21.083
they're going to help Alicia

53:21.214 --> 53:22.954
and it really is just speaking

53:23.085 --> 53:25.566
to how much they care about her,

53:25.696 --> 53:28.612
but it's really
about trusting a character

53:28.743 --> 53:31.572
who has been a very strong ally

53:31.702 --> 53:34.488
and who has recently
become a leader to them.

53:34.618 --> 53:36.794
My friend --
he's not out there.

53:36.925 --> 53:38.100
♪

53:38.231 --> 53:40.145
He's here in this Tower.

53:40.276 --> 53:43.018
That's why I wanted
to come in here.

53:43.148 --> 53:44.106
What is his name?

53:44.237 --> 53:47.152
♪

53:47.283 --> 53:49.503
Victor Strand.

53:49.633 --> 53:51.113
Alicia realizes the reason

53:51.244 --> 53:54.943
that her subconscious
brought her to the tower --

53:55.073 --> 53:59.252
kind of in order to preserve
the part of herself

53:59.382 --> 54:01.166
who would give, as a child,

54:01.297 --> 54:04.605
an injured bird who was
beyond hope a second chance,

54:04.735 --> 54:06.215
she's got to do the same thing
for Strand.

54:06.346 --> 54:09.479
She's got to give someone
who she cares about deeply,

54:09.610 --> 54:11.046
who may have hurt her,

54:11.176 --> 54:12.482
who may have done
some really terrible things,

54:12.613 --> 54:14.745
she's got to give him
a second chance.

54:14.876 --> 54:16.225
Why'd you save me...

54:17.313 --> 54:19.489
...after everything
I've done?

54:19.620 --> 54:23.058
And Strand doesn't understand
why she's done this.

54:23.188 --> 54:26.061
And she essentially gives Strand
his mission, which is...

54:26.191 --> 54:30.457
So you can do what
I don't have time left to do.

54:30.587 --> 54:33.721
So you can find a place
for everyone to be safe.

54:33.851 --> 54:35.853
It's something that we'll see
whether or not

54:35.984 --> 54:37.594
he takes up as we go forward.

54:37.725 --> 54:41.032
But Strand's essentially
got to pick up Alicia's mantle

54:41.163 --> 54:44.732
and try to build the kind of
place that she wanted to build.

54:44.862 --> 54:48.910
♪

54:49.040 --> 54:51.173
I don't understand.

54:51.304 --> 54:53.610
You do, Alicia.

54:53.741 --> 54:56.570
You're...

54:56.700 --> 54:58.528
me.

54:58.659 --> 55:02.880
You know, it really was thinking
about a way to externalize

55:03.011 --> 55:06.144
this idea that Alicia,
in her last moments,

55:06.275 --> 55:07.624
would actually fight

55:07.755 --> 55:10.758
to save the thing
that makes her special.

55:10.888 --> 55:13.151
She gave her a chance
when no one else would.

55:13.282 --> 55:15.458
There's not
a whole lot of that left.

55:15.589 --> 55:18.461
So it was a lot of fun to build
to that reveal

55:18.592 --> 55:22.291
and to, you know,
plant the breadcrumbs for it,

55:22.422 --> 55:24.467
you know,
throughout the episode.

55:24.598 --> 55:26.730
And it was also a good challenge
to find someone

55:26.861 --> 55:30.560
who could convincingly play
in an eight-year-old Alicia

55:30.691 --> 55:33.650
and fun to see them
kind of side by side.

55:33.781 --> 55:37.045
Victor,
I didn't just save you...

55:38.786 --> 55:41.049
...so you could live to what
I couldn't.

55:41.179 --> 55:43.225
♪

55:43.356 --> 55:45.270
I did it because
I love you, too.

55:45.401 --> 55:49.536
It was very difficult to write
Alicia's last episode

55:49.666 --> 55:53.191
and to say goodbye to her,
both as a character

55:53.322 --> 55:54.715
and then also say goodbye to

55:54.845 --> 55:57.108
Alycia Debnam-Carey
as an actor

55:57.239 --> 55:59.589
because she's been such
an integral part of the show

55:59.720 --> 56:01.591
from the very beginning,
but it's something

56:01.722 --> 56:06.074
that we've been working towards
for a while and something

56:06.204 --> 56:09.120
we've been working towards
very closely with Alycia.

56:09.251 --> 56:12.210
It's up to you...

56:12.341 --> 56:15.388
[voice breaking] to make sure
everything we been through

56:15.518 --> 56:16.998
means something.

56:17.128 --> 56:20.131
Chambliss: Alicia's journey
was all about this moment

56:20.262 --> 56:23.918
where she can essentially save

56:24.048 --> 56:26.747
kind of this
core part of herself,

56:26.877 --> 56:31.534
and that's this belief that
there can be good in people.

56:31.665 --> 56:33.928
And in many ways,
it's kind of an extension

56:34.058 --> 56:35.408
of what her mother believed,

56:35.538 --> 56:37.627
that no one's gone
until they're gone.

56:37.758 --> 56:39.803
And that is what
we started with,

56:39.934 --> 56:44.112
and that is ultimately how
we got to the story that you see

56:44.242 --> 56:45.635
when you watch the episode.

56:55.776 --> 56:59.562
Alicia collapses seemingly
succumbing to the fever.

56:59.693 --> 57:02.435
She wakes up seeing this bird
flying over her.

57:02.565 --> 57:04.654
And I think it's open
to interpretation

57:04.785 --> 57:07.222
whether or not
that bird is really there,

57:07.352 --> 57:09.616
whether or not she really freed
a bird from the Tower,

57:09.746 --> 57:12.140
or whether that was all part
of her subconscious.

57:12.270 --> 57:15.056

just her subconscious

57:15.186 --> 57:17.362
trying to guide her once again.

57:17.493 --> 57:19.495
And we really wanted to build
this kind of

57:19.626 --> 57:21.149
reawakening of Alicia,

57:21.279 --> 57:25.109
where she has been through
this incredible journey

57:25.240 --> 57:29.549
and is now standing up
and is going to be walking into

57:29.679 --> 57:32.377
kind of a new world
with a newfound strength.

making sure they have
someplace safe to go.

that bullet

out of fear of turning.

57:46.174 --> 57:48.611
And, you know, her using that
on a walker really is a sign

57:48.742 --> 57:51.788
that Alicia believes
she has beaten this thing,

57:51.919 --> 57:54.225
that Alicia thinks
she's going to live.
