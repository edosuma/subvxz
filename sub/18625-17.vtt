-[indistinct chatter]
-[rapid footsteps]

00:48.840 --> 00:51.301
-What is that?
-Is that a human? Wha...?

00:52.636 --> 00:54.429
[gasping, angry chattering]

00:56.848 --> 01:01.103
A human intruder! It stole my stockings!

01:01.186 --> 01:04.605
-Call the Trollhunter!
-Hey!

01:04.690 --> 01:06.483
[growls]

01:09.778 --> 01:11.989
<i>Never in my wildest dreams</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:14.575
<i>did I dare think I'd ever see</i>
<i>such a sight.</i>

01:15.284 --> 01:16.660
<i>It must be the Triumbric Stones.</i>

01:16.743 --> 01:19.913
<i>Three shards of legend</i>
<i>tied to Gunmar's lifeblood.</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:21.873
<i>Because we are going to destroy him.</i>

01:21.957 --> 01:26.253
-He found the Birthstone.
-He thinks he can kill Gunmar?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.672
-We told him he couldn't!
-[Kanjigar] Silence!

01:30.716 --> 01:34.011
You said it was impossible to kill Gunmar,
but I found a way.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.097
You're either a lousy council
or a worse liar.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.392
We needed to deter you
from making a grave mistake.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.519
You were lucky to obtain the Birthstone,

01:42.602 --> 01:46.148
but the journey will only grow
more treacherous from here onward.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.568
With all due respect, you said
a Trollhunter should only work alone,

01:49.651 --> 01:52.946
but if it weren't for my friends,
I wouldn't even have the first stone.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.699
-[female voice] The boy won't listen.
-[male voice] He mocks us.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.951
[male voice 2]
What's the point in council?

01:58.035 --> 02:01.330
If you insist on risking the lives
of everyone you care about,

02:01.413 --> 02:03.832
I advise you to listen to reason!

02:03.915 --> 02:05.834
[Draal]
<i>Trollhunter! Trollhunter!</i>

02:05.917 --> 02:08.794
My son! He seeks you.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.381
There is trouble in Trollmarket.
An intruder! Go!

02:11.465 --> 02:13.842
-An intruder? How'd he get in?
-Go!

02:15.802 --> 02:17.429
-Intruder!
-We should eat him!

02:17.512 --> 02:20.182
-We don't eat humans!
-What if he's a changeling?

02:20.265 --> 02:21.975
A changeling intruder!

02:22.059 --> 02:24.603
Hey, stop! Let him go!

02:25.395 --> 02:29.232
I'm the Trollhunter. I'll deal with it.
Let him go.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.611
-[overlapping chatter]
-Hmm...

02:39.326 --> 02:41.995
-Oh. Thank you, Jim.
-[all gasp]

02:42.079 --> 02:44.998
How did you get past Trollmarket's barrier
and how do you know my name?

02:45.082 --> 02:49.461
-Master Jim, it's me, Blinky.
-No. He lies.

02:49.544 --> 02:53.757
Strike the fleshbag down.
He's seen too much.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.842
I can prove it.
Your mother is Barbara Lake.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.387
Your best friend is Tobias Domzalski.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.680
Your father disappeared
when you were five.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.517
-The changeling spy has studied you.
-[growls]

03:03.600 --> 03:07.312
And we just replaced the ignition
on your Vespa last week.

03:07.396 --> 03:10.023
Did Strickler put you up to this?
You're working for him, aren't you?

03:10.107 --> 03:12.484
How did you get in here?
I won't ask again.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.363
I do not appreciate
your tone of voice, Master Jim.

03:16.446 --> 03:20.409
Is this the way you address
an errant stranger in need?

03:20.492 --> 03:22.869
-I expect more from you.
-Blinky?

03:24.287 --> 03:25.997
-You look terrible.
-[sighs]

03:26.998 --> 03:29.000
[chuckles]
Squishy.

03:29.084 --> 03:32.254
Among other things,
my considerable companion.

03:32.337 --> 03:36.883
-[sniffs] What sorcery is at work here?
-Haven't the foggiest.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.845
But there is one troll in Trollmarket
who will know.

03:42.723 --> 03:46.435
I am at a complete and utter loss.

03:46.518 --> 03:53.066
I can turn wolftoads into willowbait,
and willowbait into wolftoads, but this?

03:53.150 --> 03:56.361
What nonsense have you stumbled
into now, Blinkous?

03:56.445 --> 03:59.906
-Nothing unusual.
-Eaten by Gatto.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.118
You went into Gatto's Keep?
[inhales deeply]

04:03.201 --> 04:06.037
Just what kind of insanity possessed you?

04:06.121 --> 04:08.457
It was my decision.
We went for the Birthstone.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.625
And I had the unfortunate experience

04:10.709 --> 04:12.544
of being swallowed
by that slubberdegullion

04:12.627 --> 04:15.172
and drenched
by innumerous potions and--

04:15.255 --> 04:16.839
Oh, my Gorgus!

04:16.923 --> 04:20.051
That must be the explanation
for my transformation!

04:20.135 --> 04:22.220
And why would you venture--?

04:22.304 --> 04:24.723
-To complete the Triumbric Stones.
-[chuckles]

04:24.806 --> 04:28.185
So we can destroy Gunmar
and save Claire's brother.

04:28.268 --> 04:33.231
-Vendel mad?
-Mad would be a significant improvement!

04:33.315 --> 04:36.151
The Trollhunter is to protect
the Trollmarket,

04:36.234 --> 04:40.322
not risk his life chasing stones
from fairy tales.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.823
Oh!

04:43.575 --> 04:49.247
Oh, my... Gunmar's birthstone.
The legends are true.

04:50.081 --> 04:53.460
This stays here,
safe from your bumbling hands.

04:53.543 --> 04:57.923
Speaking of hands, uh,
when am I going to get my other two back?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.217
It could be days, weeks.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.260
It's impossible to know
when an enchantment

05:02.344 --> 05:04.095
of this severity could wear off.

05:04.179 --> 05:08.350
-Well, then, what shall I do until then?
-It's your choice.

05:08.433 --> 05:14.105
Stay here for me to poke and prod,
or enjoy your day in the sun.

05:14.189 --> 05:17.025
For as long as it lasts.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.195
[metal clanking]

05:22.656 --> 05:25.659
[chuckles]
The Janus Order has sent me.

05:25.742 --> 05:29.538
They are starting to question
your leadership.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.123
[yells, groans]

05:33.291 --> 05:35.418
-They are worried...
-[metal clanking]

05:36.711 --> 05:39.297
you don't have everything in control.

05:39.381 --> 05:45.345
As long as his ring is on my finger,
I can control him.

05:45.428 --> 05:49.182
But how long will that finger
be on your hand?

05:50.809 --> 05:52.185
-[whimpers]
-[moans]

05:52.269 --> 05:53.186
[clears throat]

05:53.270 --> 05:58.692
We have information to suggest
the Trollhunter possesses the Birthstone.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.529
They weren't supposed to know about that.
I thought you burned the books.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.865
I did. But now, I know the path he seeks

06:05.949 --> 06:08.618
and can use this information
to our tactical advantage.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.913
But what about the bigger picture?

06:20.672 --> 06:24.175
Eliminating the Trollhunter
is but the first part of my machinations.

06:24.968 --> 06:28.555
A new police chief in Bordeaux,
a state senator in Boise,

06:28.638 --> 06:30.348
a news editor in Shanghai.

06:30.432 --> 06:34.644
All in the last month.
The Janus Order is growing, infiltrating.

06:34.728 --> 06:39.816
Together, we who were called "impure"
will one day control the world,

06:39.899 --> 06:41.735
and the world won't even know it.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.655
Without Gunmar,
there is a vacant throne for the taking.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.992
And who will fill it, <i>mein Freund</i> ?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.035
[chuckles]

06:54.414 --> 06:58.335
Uh, did you just rip off
a piece of your body?

06:58.418 --> 07:01.046
Would you rather I rip off
a piece of yours?

07:01.129 --> 07:02.255
[whimpers]

07:02.339 --> 07:04.633
And what are those for?

07:04.716 --> 07:10.096
His friends.
Time I met with the hunter alone.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.478
[car horn honking]

07:22.484 --> 07:25.862
You ready?
Don't worry, it's not gonna hurt.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.948
[Aaarrrgghh moans]

07:29.157 --> 07:32.577
I'm sorry you won't be joining me
on this adventure, my friend.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.287
Mm.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.467
There you go. See? You're fine.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.803
[gasps]

07:50.887 --> 07:52.847
It's so...

07:52.931 --> 07:53.932
...bright!

07:54.015 --> 07:56.685
Yeah, well, don't stare at it.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.312
Master Jim, I want to see more!

08:01.106 --> 08:02.232
Hmm...

08:02.399 --> 08:04.484
Good-bye.

08:10.699 --> 08:14.035
I've seen the surface so many times,
but never like this.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.454
It's so... beautiful!

08:16.538 --> 08:18.707
-[horn honking]
-[man] Get out of the road, freak!

08:18.790 --> 08:22.002
What a kind gesture.
Thank you, stranger!

08:22.085 --> 08:24.713
-I was in need of a snack.
-No, no, Blinky, wait.

08:24.796 --> 08:27.424
Well, that does not taste
very good anymore.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.925
-[horn honking]
-[chuckles]

08:29.009 --> 08:29.926
[woman]
Freak!

08:30.677 --> 08:34.014
There's so much I want to do,
so much I haven't seen.

08:34.097 --> 08:38.518
I've never cared much for human food,
but... but the flavor!

08:38.601 --> 08:39.769
The texture!

08:39.852 --> 08:42.063
If only I had two more hands
to eat faster.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.858
-What do you call this cuisine?
-Leftovers?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.443
I can't even look at you.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.655
Your whole body is like an old sausage
left on the grill too long.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.782
Very amusing. Who invited him?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.951
It's boring sittin' around
the crib all day.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.244
When I heard you changed,

08:56.327 --> 09:00.874
I didn't know it was into a fat, balding,
hot fudge sundae. [laughing]

09:00.957 --> 09:05.545
I didn't have time to tell you.
While you were seeking the stone,

09:05.628 --> 09:08.840
that changeling Stricklander
dropped your mother off outside.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.342
Yeah, I know.
I sorta caught him on the way out.

09:11.426 --> 09:15.555
But maybe you did not see, he...

09:16.431 --> 09:17.557
Uh...
[sighs]

09:17.640 --> 09:20.810
smushed faces with the Barbara.

09:20.894 --> 09:24.105
-He what?
-What is the word you use?

09:24.189 --> 09:26.441
-Uh, "kissed"?
-[grunts]

09:27.275 --> 09:30.111
-I should have struck him down.
-Yeah, you should have.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.072
I mean, no. Ugh, no!

09:32.155 --> 09:35.366
He has a spell.
If anyone hurts him, it hurts my mom.

09:35.450 --> 09:40.163
Gah! He's all over my mom.
I can't lay a finger on him.

09:40.246 --> 09:44.042
He's trying to get
under your skin, Trollhunter.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.544
Do not let him.

09:46.628 --> 09:50.924
It's filled with glop,
yet the exterior is so soft and squishy.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.884
How do they keep it all in?

09:52.967 --> 09:54.469
[stomach grumbles]

09:54.552 --> 09:56.930
I think my stomach
is trying to communicate with me.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.056
[grumbling continues]

09:58.139 --> 09:59.724
That ain't your stomach, pal.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.601
After eating a buffet like that,

10:01.684 --> 10:05.063
that fleshy inner tube of a body
is about to spring a leak.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.564
-Ah...
-Uh...

10:06.648 --> 10:08.024
[grumbling continues]

10:08.108 --> 10:08.983
Oh, dear.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.735
[screams]

10:10.819 --> 10:12.445
[groans]

10:12.529 --> 10:15.949
This is absurd. How can you function
with only two eyes?

10:16.491 --> 10:17.742
-[door slams shut]
-[Blinky] Ooh!

10:17.826 --> 10:20.870
You didn't happen to overhear who
Strickler brought back with him, did you?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.915
Some troll with big horns
and a weird staff, maybe?

10:23.998 --> 10:28.253
-Sorry, I do not know.
-Yeah, well, neither do we.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.964
-[car alarm beeping, keys jingling]
-Ah! My mom's home! Everyone, hide!

10:31.047 --> 10:32.382
Oh, jeez! Oh...

10:33.049 --> 10:35.009
[whimpering]
Hide, hide.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.595
-[toilet flushing]
-Oh, no. Blinky!

10:38.388 --> 10:39.722
What the--? No!

10:40.765 --> 10:42.100
Not with the leftovers!

10:43.977 --> 10:48.148
I have to say, indoor plumbing
is the most remarkable...

10:48.815 --> 10:50.233
[gasps]

10:50.316 --> 10:52.277
I don't care what you're doing,

10:52.360 --> 10:54.362
but if you're not out of my house
in five seconds,

10:54.445 --> 10:58.158
I have an orange belt in Krav Maga,
and I will not hesitate to use it.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.035
I can explain
if you'll just allow me to--

11:01.119 --> 11:02.036
Soft targets.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.538
Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Hah!

11:03.621 --> 11:06.749
[yelps]
My eyes! My two vulnerable eyes!

11:06.833 --> 11:08.501
-[grunting]
-[objects clattering]

11:08.585 --> 11:09.586
No more, please!

11:09.669 --> 11:12.463
-No more, you violent woman!
-Mom! Wait, wait, he's with me!

11:12.547 --> 11:15.925
Jim? He's... Oh! Wait, wait.
What? I'm sorry, who are you?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.136
-He's, uh...
-I'm, uh...

11:18.219 --> 11:19.721
He's Mr. Blinky.
[chuckles]

11:19.804 --> 11:22.140
-[both groan]
-Okay, what has Jim done now?

11:22.223 --> 11:27.020
No, no, no. Jim isn't in any trouble.
I'm here to... assist.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.440
Yeah, he's my, uh, guidance counselor
from my school.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.984
Since when do guidance counselors
make house calls?

11:33.067 --> 11:35.904
-I'm new.
-Principal Strickler just brought him in.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.405
[stomach grumbling]

11:38.531 --> 11:41.159
[clears throat]
Do you mind if we speak alone?

11:42.577 --> 11:45.955
When I was first introduced to your son,
I'd never met anyone like him.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.250
He was scared, vulnerable,
filled with questions.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.586
He was acting out.

11:51.669 --> 11:57.175
Having a father walk out on one's life
is a traumatic experience enough,

11:57.258 --> 11:59.552
but at his tender age...

12:01.971 --> 12:04.641
Sweetie, if you needed to talk
to someone...

12:04.724 --> 12:08.311
-Well, you're kind of always working.
-That's what this is about?

12:08.394 --> 12:09.771
The trouble you've been getting into

12:09.854 --> 12:11.773
and the late nights
and the strange behavior?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.192
The letter...

12:14.275 --> 12:17.737
I wasn't sure how to tell you,
and I had to tell someone,

12:17.820 --> 12:20.323
and Mr. Blinky's helped me
through a lot of stuff.

12:20.406 --> 12:24.953
-Mr. Blinky?
-Bulgarian. It's pronounced "Blink-heh."

12:29.457 --> 12:33.336
-I really appreciate that, Mr. Blinky.
-Blink-heh.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.215
-And I'm sorry I kicked you earlier.
-The pain is tolerable.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.718
Well, if there's any help that I can be...

12:40.802 --> 12:42.804
You know what?
I'm gonna write down my number.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.806
Please just call me anytime.

12:46.140 --> 12:49.352
-You know I don't care about my father.
-You do now.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.230
If this helps Jim work out,
you know, what he's--

12:52.313 --> 12:56.985
well, what <i>we're </i> going through,
I just want to be supportive.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.945
Just let me know
if there's anything I can do.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.698
Since you're a doctor,
there has been this issue with my stomach.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.658
-[stomach grumbling]
-There it goes again.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.702
-Well--
-[Claire] Is it true? Is it really true?

13:05.785 --> 13:09.080
We came as soon as we--
Oh, hi, Dr. L.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.456
So it is true.

13:10.540 --> 13:14.961
Um, you really can get to here
from school in under ten minutes.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.506
Awesome sauce!

13:18.589 --> 13:21.092
-[loud clattering]
-[moaning]

13:21.175 --> 13:22.135
[gasps]

13:22.218 --> 13:26.806
Uh, I was just introducing
my mother to Mr. Blinky,

13:26.889 --> 13:28.933
our guidance counselor.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.728
-[chuckles] Nice to meet you.
-Good to see you again.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.855
[baby moaning]

13:33.938 --> 13:36.107
Huh? Is he...?

13:36.190 --> 13:38.443
Do you mind if we borrow
your son and Mr. Blinky?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.361
We're burning sunlight, Dr. L.
You know what I mean?

13:41.195 --> 13:42.613
Oh, yes, of course. Go.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.827
Honey, did Claire come in with that baby?

13:47.910 --> 13:52.206
No, he just walked in here on his own
and he asked for a ride. Come on, Mom.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.842
Come on! Hurry home before
Mom and Dad notice you're gone.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.177
[growls]

14:04.260 --> 14:07.263
So, what now, Blink? It's your big day!

14:07.346 --> 14:09.932
There's only so much time
and so much to do.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.185
I can brunch. I can picnic in the park.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.979
Sunbathe at the beach.
And dare I say, boogie board.

14:15.063 --> 14:20.234
And, oh, my Gorgus! I can get
behind the wheel of an automobile!

14:20.318 --> 14:23.738
Well, the day is almost over,
but I think I know just the place.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.409
Almost there.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.579
[grunts]
Who voted for hiking?

14:31.662 --> 14:35.541
I thought we were supposed
to be doing cool outdoor activities.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.459
[wheezes]

14:37.210 --> 14:38.628
[Claire]
Looks like someone had a party.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.551
It's... charming?
[sniffs]

14:45.635 --> 14:49.013
No, she means this.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.265
-Doesn't get any better than this.
-[gasps]

14:56.771 --> 14:59.524
It's breathtaking.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.026
Words cannot describe.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.446
Yeah, well, imagine if you had six eyes.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.448
[pants]

15:07.532 --> 15:11.035
So your first day as a human
is almost to a close.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.956
-Anything else you want to do?
-No. Just this.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.792
If only Aaarrrgghh could be here, too.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.628
I'm so anxious to tell him
about all of our adventures.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.090
Thank you, Master Jim.
Today was a day I will never forget.

15:25.216 --> 15:29.345
But if I am to be honest, I have to wonder
how many days this will last.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.891
And this skin...
I am still uncomfortable in it.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.269
-Welcome to being a teenager.
-Don't worry, Blink.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.980
Maybe now I can be the one
who helps train you.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.777
[ominous music playing]

15:50.867 --> 15:52.952
[laughing]

15:57.540 --> 16:00.710
This view is amazing.
How did you hear about this place?

16:00.793 --> 16:04.380
Logan brought me up here
to ask me out to the Spring Fling.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.591
Oh! He did?

16:07.508 --> 16:08.509
Well, are you--?

16:08.593 --> 16:11.679
I told him I was waiting
for someone else to ask me.

16:11.762 --> 16:12.680
[chuckles]

16:14.390 --> 16:15.975
Um...

16:16.976 --> 16:17.852
[chuckles]

16:21.105 --> 16:22.064
[coughs]

16:23.733 --> 16:25.276
Uh, uh...

16:25.359 --> 16:29.197
[gasps] Would you look at this?
I hate it when people litter.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.949
-Maybe I should... eh...
-[sighs]

16:35.703 --> 16:37.788
-[Claire whispers] Idiot.
-You blew it, man.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.750
Claire Nuñez wanted you
to ask her to the dance,

16:40.833 --> 16:42.293
and you stood there and did nothing.

16:42.376 --> 16:47.006
Even I think you...
How did you say it? Ah, yes. "Blew it."

16:47.089 --> 16:49.467
-What was I supposed to say?
-[Claire screams]

16:50.218 --> 16:51.219
Jim!

16:56.474 --> 16:57.642
Another golem?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.644
-I thought you said it was made of mud!
-Not glass!

16:59.727 --> 17:02.730
Well, there's four of us
and only one of him.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.690
Flank him!

17:07.276 --> 17:10.655
Master Jim, it appears
we have another guest!

17:12.698 --> 17:13.532
Get down!

17:15.910 --> 17:18.913
[yelps]
Ow! Our flank was outflanked.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.623
-Jim, what do we do?
-I don't know.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.834
Last time,
there was a weird stone doll in it.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.003
An animus totem. We must rip them
from out of the beasts' hearts

17:27.088 --> 17:28.172
and destroy them.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.258
You mean, I gotta put
my hand in that thing?

17:30.341 --> 17:34.845
Stand back, friends. They are no match
for the rocky fists of justice.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.098
Ow!

17:37.181 --> 17:40.810
Sharp things!
That was a sobering reminder.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.312
Blinky, run!

17:48.359 --> 17:49.443
[grunts]

17:50.570 --> 17:54.240
[grunts] Get away from her,
you big sparkly simpleton!

17:59.912 --> 18:00.871
[grunting]

18:04.500 --> 18:05.918
[grunting]

18:07.128 --> 18:08.462
[grunts, yells]

18:10.172 --> 18:12.717
We need to hit one hard and fast
to get to the totem.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.428
Throw everything
you can get your hands on.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.974
[grunting]

18:20.057 --> 18:23.394
[chuckling]
Welcome to the rock show!

18:24.979 --> 18:27.273
That it looked a lot cooler
in my head. [chuckles]

18:30.276 --> 18:32.153
[yelling]

18:36.616 --> 18:37.992
[snarling]

18:40.077 --> 18:41.245
[both scream]

18:41.329 --> 18:42.413
Jim!

18:42.496 --> 18:45.166
[yelling]

18:49.337 --> 18:50.963
He's getting away!

18:51.047 --> 18:53.174
-[grunting]
-[growls]

18:58.763 --> 19:01.098
Gotcha! Oh, yeah! We got this!

19:02.600 --> 19:06.395
I am currently short of hands,
Master Jim. Master Jim!

19:27.166 --> 19:29.001
[muffled moaning]

19:29.085 --> 19:31.128
[laughing]

19:31.212 --> 19:33.964
[muffled moaning]

19:37.885 --> 19:39.970
[muffled screaming]

19:42.932 --> 19:45.351
Mmm...

19:45.434 --> 19:50.606
You've wandered into my web,
my human hunter.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.567
I am Angor Rot,

19:53.651 --> 19:59.865
and I will be the last you see
before you die.

19:59.949 --> 20:03.536
-We need more rocks.
-I'm down to pebbles.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.081
Follow me!

20:10.835 --> 20:12.628
Whoa! Not you, buddy.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.007
Trapping it inside.
Excellent stratagem, Tobias.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.676
Totally the plan. Yep.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.511
[muffled screaming]

20:20.594 --> 20:22.012
Shh...

20:22.096 --> 20:24.265
It's useless to speak.

20:25.516 --> 20:31.105
I have killed hunters in the past
but never a human one.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.774
Such curious game.

20:33.858 --> 20:38.946
I will not give
the sweet release of death.

20:39.029 --> 20:43.117
Not yet. I will relish this hunt.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.119
[muffled screaming]

20:45.202 --> 20:49.206
Relax. Your friends won't help you now.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.919
[muffled screaming]

20:54.003 --> 20:56.589
-[suspenseful music playing]
-[snarling]

20:56.672 --> 21:01.093
[yelps] Suddenly, I understand
how vulnerable humans feel.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.974
Ha! Got it!

21:07.057 --> 21:08.434
-We did it!
-[both scream]

21:08.517 --> 21:09.727
Jim! Help!

21:09.810 --> 21:12.021
[muffled screaming]

21:19.862 --> 21:25.242
[chanting in foreign language]

21:27.495 --> 21:33.459
Next time we meet, hunter,
Daylight will be mine to command.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.546
Jim!

21:37.630 --> 21:39.840
He's in a stasis trap.
Don't touch the stones.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.760
[groans]

21:42.843 --> 21:44.428
Master Jim, the golem!

21:46.013 --> 21:48.182
[snarling]

21:48.849 --> 21:50.267
[yelling]

21:57.817 --> 21:59.068
[sighs]

22:00.152 --> 22:01.612
Jim, your face.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.950
The golems... they were a distraction.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.994
-What does it mean?
-The sigil of Angor Rot.

22:09.078 --> 22:13.499
Master Jim, I fear you have been marked
for a fate worse than death.
