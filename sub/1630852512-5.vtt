a sports so intense,

00:23.257 --> 00:24.923
gary busey once referred to it

<i>  after a loss</i>

01:14.508 --> 01:16.442
<i>  flip back into the win column</i>

01:16.444 --> 01:19.244

<i>  over tombstone.</i>

<i>  and business</i>
<i>  is booming so much</i>

<i>  against a knockout artist,</i>

<i>  free shipping needs</i>

<i>  and try to break that spear</i>

[kenny]
<i>  well,</i>
<i>  he's definitely confident,</i>

04:53.127 --> 04:54.893
<i>  but alex admitted</i>
<i>  that uppercut</i>

04:54.895 --> 04:57.763
<i>  took a lot of internal damage</i>
<i>  in its win over gigabyte.</i>

04:57.765 --> 04:59.531
<i>  He and his team</i>
<i>  have made a real push</i>

05:08.742 --> 05:10.509

05:12.913 --> 05:16.048
<i>  uppercut is a pretty powerful</i>
<i>  vertical spinner,</i>

<i>  if he gets a good hit on us,</i>
<i>  he can do quite</i>
<i>  a bit of damage.</i>

05:19.320 --> 05:21.286
<i>  The key to our success</i>
<i>  against uppercut</i>

05:21.288 --> 05:24.890
<i> is just going out at him fast,</i>
<i>  going at him hard,</i>

05:24.892 --> 05:26.158
<i>  hopefully get under him</i>

05:26.160 --> 05:28.860
<i>  and maybe take some control</i>
<i>  over him.</i>

05:28.862 --> 05:30.395
<i>  Who knows</i>
<i>  what's going to happen.</i>

05:30.397 --> 05:34.933
<i>  Since our record is now</i>
<i>  zero wins and one loss,</i>

05:34.935 --> 05:37.969
<i>  it's even more important</i>
<i>  that we get a win</i>

05:37.971 --> 05:39.071
<i>  in this next fight.</i>

05:39.073 --> 05:40.572
<i>  Yeah, so with free shipping,</i>

05:40.574 --> 05:43.208
<i> we're mostly worried about him</i>
<i>  getting underneath us</i>

05:43.210 --> 05:44.343
<i>  and pushing us around.</i>

05:44.345 --> 05:46.278
<i>  So we're hoping</i>
<i>  to use our attachments</i>

05:46.280 --> 05:48.246
<i>  to get under him early on</i>
<i>  in the match</i>

05:48.248 --> 05:50.415
<i>  and then be able to throw</i>
<i>  him around as possible.</i>

05:50.417 --> 05:52.384
<i>  Last year,</i>
<i>  one of our biggest moments</i>

05:52.386 --> 05:55.020
<i>  was when we fought sawblaze,</i>
<i>  he also had a flamethrower</i>

05:55.022 --> 05:56.888
<i>  and I believe</i>
<i>  free shipping's flamethrower</i>

05:56.890 --> 05:57.956
<i>  is even bigger,</i>

05:57.958 --> 05:59.891
<i>  so we'll see</i>
<i>  if we can get a good hit</i>

05:59.893 --> 06:01.960
<i>  and a good exposure</i>
<i>  out of their flame thrower.</i>

06:01.962 --> 06:03.462
<i>  Uppercut is</i>
<i>  incredibly destructive</i>

06:03.464 --> 06:04.563
<i>  in a large volume,</i>

06:04.565 --> 06:06.365
<i>  so we're hoping that</i>
<i>  at some point</i>

06:06.367 --> 06:09.368

<i>  we'll be able to land at</i>
<i>  least one good hit on them.</i>

09:06.246 --> 09:08.847
Alex, you told us
at the beginning of the season

09:08.849 --> 09:10.849
that you wanted to be
more entertaining

09:10.851 --> 09:12.417

09:29.169 --> 09:31.369
so I feel like they might
have felt pretty good

09:31.371 --> 09:32.470
in the beginning.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.573
In the beginning
and then what?

09:34.575 --> 09:35.907
Then stuff happened.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.009
[laughter]

09:38.011 --> 09:39.945
alex hattori, congratulations

09:39.947 --> 09:41.913

09:53.961 --> 09:56.328
His bot definitely
does the talking.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.464
<i>  Coming up,</i>
<i>  it's always a good time</i>

10:01.468 --> 10:03.201
<i>  blacksmith and shatter!,</i>

10:03.203 --> 10:06.204
<i>  they duke it out</i>
<i>  for hammer supremacy.</i>

10:06.206 --> 10:08.974

[chris]
<i>  welcome back to battlebots</i>

10:18.051 --> 10:20.986
<i>  and up next, yeah,</i>
<i>  it's hammer time</i>

10:20.988 --> 10:23.555
<i>  as blacksmith throws down</i>
<i>  with shatter!</i>

10:24.825 --> 10:27.092
<i>  Let's start</i>
<i>  with the metallic mafia</i>

10:27.094 --> 10:29.494
<i>  from new jersey, blacksmith.</i>

10:29.496 --> 10:32.397
<i>  After taking a year off</i>
<i>  from combat robotics,</i>

10:32.399 --> 10:34.933
<i>  al kindle and team blacksmith</i>

10:34.935 --> 10:37.869
<i>  came surging back</i>
<i>  onto the scene this season.</i>

10:37.871 --> 10:38.870
<i>  So the big question</i>

10:38.872 --> 10:41.606
<i>  of what is blacksmith sealing</i>
<i>  this year?</i>

10:41.608 --> 10:44.709
[kenny]
<i>  well, it's tough to say</i>
<i> with such a small sample size,</i>

10:44.711 --> 10:47.312
<i>  but that power hammer upgrade</i>
<i>  al gave to his weapon</i>

10:47.314 --> 10:49.981
<i>  seems to be making</i>
<i>  a big difference.</i>

10:49.983 --> 10:52.417
<i>  In a very close fight</i>
<i>  against free shipping,</i>

10:52.419 --> 10:55.920
<i> blacksmith managed to deal out</i>
<i>  just enough damage</i>

10:55.922 --> 10:58.189
<i>  in the eyes of the judges</i>
<i>  to take the w.</i>

10:58.191 --> 10:59.924
<i> [faruq] blacksmith.</i>

10:59.926 --> 11:02.293
<i> [kenny] interested to see</i>
<i>  what kind of statement</i>

11:02.295 --> 11:04.863
<i>  he makes here</i>
<i>  in its second fight.</i>

11:04.865 --> 11:06.498
[chris]
<i>  and from across the hudson,</i>

11:06.500 --> 11:10.368
<i>  we have brooklyn's</i>
<i>  adam wrigley and shatter!</i>

11:10.370 --> 11:12.337
<i>  Coming in with a record</i>
<i>  of 1-0</i>

11:12.339 --> 11:14.305
<i>  after winning</i>
<i>  a judge's decision</i>

11:14.307 --> 11:17.108
<i>  against subzero</i>
<i>  in an unaired fight,</i>

11:17.110 --> 11:21.146
<i> another w here could send them</i>
<i>  into the round of 32</i>

11:21.148 --> 11:23.515
<i>  for the second</i>
<i>  consecutive season.</i>

11:23.517 --> 11:25.717
<i> [kenny] yeah, even though</i>
<i>  shatter! Made it</i>

11:25.719 --> 11:27.419
<i>  all the way</i>
<i>  to the quarter finals,</i>

11:27.421 --> 11:31.089
<i>  only to lose</i>
<i>  to eventual champs</i>
<i>  end game last year,</i>

11:31.091 --> 11:33.958
<i>  adam actually told us</i>
<i>  he was disappointed</i>

11:33.960 --> 11:36.327
<i>  in what he called</i>
<i>  an early exit</i>

11:36.329 --> 11:39.197
<i>  and is hell bent</i>
<i>  on making a serious run</i>

11:39.199 --> 11:41.132
<i>  at the giant nut in 2021.</i>

11:41.134 --> 11:43.201
Let's check it out. Faruq?

home of menlo park,

11:53.080 --> 11:57.348
this box force to be stronger
than the armor of tony stark.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.517
You'll be dust
when his hammer is fired

11:59.519 --> 12:02.721
and slams at the box
are like tin foil

12:02.723 --> 12:05.557
but he's the iron man.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.426
It's blacksmith.

12:08.428 --> 12:12.163
[music playing]

12:12.165 --> 12:13.665
<i> [chris] here comes blacksmith</i>

<i>  How does al kindle</i>
<i>  come out on top</i>
<i>  in the battle of hammers,</i>

12:19.706 --> 12:21.272
<i>  kenny?</i>

12:21.274 --> 12:23.308
<i> [kenny] well, shatter!</i>
<i>  Is going to have</i>
<i>  to reach advantage</i>

12:23.310 --> 12:25.677
<i> in this fight, so al will need</i>
<i>  to find a way</i>

12:25.679 --> 12:28.279
<i>  to get around</i>
<i>  to the size of shatter! Here.</i>

12:28.281 --> 12:29.280
<i>  If he could do that,</i>

12:29.282 --> 12:31.049
<i>  blacksmith has the power</i>

12:31.051 --> 12:34.219
<i>  to disable their weapon</i>
<i>  and move to 2-0.</i>

12:37.758 --> 12:39.324
In the blue square,

12:39.326 --> 12:42.727
this disco ball bar looks like
it listens to abba,

12:42.729 --> 12:45.897
but with its powerful acts,
it's more of a stabber.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.067
The box is his dance floor
and he's ready to drive

12:49.069 --> 12:53.371
and when he comes for you,
you won't be staying alive,

12:53.373 --> 12:56.941
giving other bots a case
of the heebie-jeebies,

12:56.943 --> 12:59.244
it's shatter!

13:03.884 --> 13:07.519
<i> [chris] shatter! Sporting</i>

<i>  they call the mary special.</i>

13:12.192 --> 13:14.926
<i>  Oh, mary, mary,</i>
<i>  that thing's sharp.</i>

13:14.928 --> 13:17.629
<i>  Stay away from that.</i>
<i>  Mary, be careful!</i>

13:17.631 --> 13:20.231
<i> [kenny] I definitely wouldn't</i>
<i>  want to hug that thing,</i>

13:20.233 --> 13:24.169
<i>  but yes, what better</i>
<i>  opportunity to debut</i>
<i>  a brand new hammer</i>

13:24.171 --> 13:26.104
<i>  than in the battle</i>
<i>  of the hammers?</i>

13:26.106 --> 13:28.907
<i>  Adam wrigley</i>
<i>  always such a show.</i>

13:28.909 --> 13:32.110
[audience cheering and

13:35.048 --> 13:37.682
<i>  shatter is possibly</i>
<i>  the best hammer out there.</i>

13:37.684 --> 13:39.284
<i>  Hits very hard.</i>

13:40.253 --> 13:42.153
<i>  The most dangerous part</i>
<i>  of shatter!</i>

13:42.155 --> 13:43.121
<i>  Is actually the reach.</i>

13:43.123 --> 13:44.556
<i>  For us to win this fight,</i>

13:44.791 --> 13:47.692
<i>  we're going to have</i>
<i>  to avoid the front</i>
<i>  of his robot somehow.</i>

13:47.694 --> 13:49.561
<i>  We need to try to get around</i>
<i>  to a side</i>

13:49.563 --> 13:52.363
<i>  and if we can do that,</i>
<i>  we could really</i>
<i>  do some damage.</i>

13:52.365 --> 13:54.833
<i>  It's important for us</i>
<i>  to do well and get a win,</i>

13:54.835 --> 13:55.934
<i>  we can go up 2 and 0.</i>

13:55.936 --> 13:57.836
<i>  You know,</i>
<i>  we're almost guaranteed</i>

13:57.838 --> 14:01.072
<i>  to get into the round</i>
<i>  of 32, so it's critical</i>
<i>  to get a good start.</i>

14:01.074 --> 14:03.007
<i>  So we looked</i>
<i>  at blacksmith's last fight</i>

14:03.009 --> 14:04.709
<i>  and the hammer saw</i>
<i>  is working well.</i>

14:04.711 --> 14:06.144
<i>  It's a scary weapon,</i>

14:06.146 --> 14:09.180
<i>  so we're taking out</i>
<i>  a whole new configuration</i>

14:09.182 --> 14:10.515
<i>  we haven't used before.</i>

14:10.517 --> 14:12.250
<i>  We have stronger top panels,</i>

14:12.252 --> 14:14.586
<i>  we have a different</i>
<i>  front configuration</i>

14:14.588 --> 14:18.323
<i>  and an all new hammer arm</i>
<i> that we call the mary special.</i>

14:18.325 --> 14:20.892
<i>  We're very excited</i>
<i>  to take them on.</i>

14:20.894 --> 14:23.228
<i>  I think the fans have wanted</i>
<i>  to see blacksmith shatter!</i>

14:23.230 --> 14:24.295
<i>  For a while now.</i>

14:24.297 --> 14:26.231
<i>  You know,</i>
<i>  we had some banter online,</i>

14:26.233 --> 14:28.366
<i>  so we've been looking forward</i>
<i>  to this one.</i>

14:28.368 --> 14:29.934
<i>  It'll be a lot of fun.</i>

<i> for more on shatter's strategy</i>

14:37.177 --> 14:40.378
<i>  in this fight,</i>
<i>  let's toss it out over</i>
<i>  to our bot whisperer,</i>

14:40.380 --> 14:41.579
<i>  pete abrahamson.</i>

14:42.482 --> 14:44.482
A couple of things
on top of shatter!

14:44.484 --> 14:48.453
Is some impact absorbing armor
that they've built onto it,

14:48.455 --> 14:50.255
of course,
with the mary special.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.991
You'll notice all
the wonderful points there.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.093
<i>  Those are meant to be able</i>
<i>  to come down</i>

14:55.095 --> 14:57.896
<i>  and go into the chains</i>
<i>  on blacksmith</i>

14:57.898 --> 14:59.397
<i>  and take out this chain.</i>

14:59.399 --> 15:01.699
But really,
the key to this strategy

15:01.701 --> 15:04.502
is their longest
social distancing forks.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.005
They hope to hold
a blacksmith back

15:07.007 --> 15:08.473
while their longer hammer

15:08.475 --> 15:11.609
will reach out
and get blacksmith.

<i>  Good shot right there</i>

<i>  With the mary special</i>
<i>  and you called it kenny,</i>

<i>  the disc on the end</i>
<i>  of blacksmith's hammer</i>

<i>  no longer appears</i>
<i>  to be functional,</i>

16:22.315 --> 16:26.017
<i>  a heck of a shot</i>
<i>  by adam wrigley</i>
<i>  and shatter! Wow.</i>

16:26.019 --> 16:30.288
<i> [kenny] the speed of that</i>
<i>  hammer is impressive to</i>
<i>  watch one, chris.</i>

Has worked to perfection

<i>  to get around</i>
<i>  to the sides of shatter!</i>

17:03.156 --> 17:04.756
<i>  And avoid that weapon</i>

17:04.758 --> 17:07.692
<i>  about 90 seconds</i>
<i>  remaining here.</i>

17:07.694 --> 17:10.528

<i>  Black reverse tail.</i>

<i>  And shatter!</i>
<i>  Is going every shot,</i>
<i>  it reverse now.</i>

17:15.101 --> 17:18.903
[chris]
<i>  unbelievable, no matter</i>
<i>  what blacksmith does,</i>

17:18.905 --> 17:21.172
<i>  it can't seem</i>
<i>  to avoid that giant weapon,</i>

17:21.174 --> 17:24.275
<i>  just too much reach</i>
<i>  from that bot brooklyn</i>

17:24.277 --> 17:28.279
<i>  and blacksmith seems unable</i>
<i> to fire its hammer arm at all.</i>

17:30.383 --> 17:32.383
[kenny]
<i>  oh, that was a beautiful hit</i>

17:32.385 --> 17:33.651

<i>  precise that is.</i>

17:45.932 --> 17:50.034

<i> nice job there from blacksmith</i>

17:51.905 --> 17:53.337

[kenny]
<i>  oh, man, you got to love it</i>

<i>  when a plan comes together.</i>

19:06.112 --> 19:08.312
<i>  Adam wrigley</i>
<i>  designed this weapon</i>

<i>  for maximum reach</i>
<i>  and precision.</i>

19:10.717 --> 19:13.985

<i>  did it perform perfectly</i>

<i>  taking out</i>
<i>  blacksmith's weapon belts,</i>

19:16.222 --> 19:18.856

<i>  in my opinion,</i>

19:18.858 --> 19:20.625
<i>  delivering shatter!</i>
<i>  The victory.</i>

19:22.829 --> 19:25.163

<i> to the mary special very early</i>
<i>  in this fight,</i>

<i>  it almost changed the course</i>
<i>  of the entire match,</i>

<i>  but shatter! Survived,</i>

19:32.238 --> 19:35.173

<i> [chris] adam wrigley.</i>

20:11.044 --> 20:12.243
I'm guessing that's the way

20:12.245 --> 20:14.245
the mary special
is supposed to work?

20:14.247 --> 20:17.048
The mary special did its job.
[laughs]

20:17.050 --> 20:19.450
mary, what's it like

20:19.452 --> 20:23.588
having a destructive
killer weapon named after you?

20:23.590 --> 20:24.722
[chuckles]

20:24.724 --> 20:25.823
it feels right.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.125
[laughing]

20:28.127 --> 20:31.329
adam, is this the start
you envisioned

20:31.331 --> 20:33.898
when you joined us here
for the 2021 season?

20:33.900 --> 20:37.068
I try not to envision
anything, so I don't jinx it,

20:37.070 --> 20:39.203
but this is great.
[chuckles]

20:39.205 --> 20:41.472
and very quickly,
what do you think of 2 and 0,

20:41.474 --> 20:43.874
impressive start
like this says
to the selection committee?

20:43.876 --> 20:44.909
Undefeated, I mean,

20:44.911 --> 20:47.011
that makes us the number one
seed right now, right.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.680
-I think we're pretty excited.
-[audience cheering and
applauding]

20:49.682 --> 20:52.250

Congratulations

<i>  shatter! Off</i>
<i>  to a very impressive</i>

21:05.398 --> 21:06.931
<i>  2 and 0 start,</i>

21:06.933 --> 21:10.401
<i>  and is looking like a shoo-in</i>
<i>  for the tournament.</i>

21:11.871 --> 21:14.238
<i>  Up next, p1 upset valkyrie</i>

21:14.240 --> 21:16.274
<i>  in its first match</i>
<i>  of the season,</i>

21:16.276 --> 21:20.778
<i>  but can he survive</i>
<i>  a tag team beat down</i>
<i>  for rookie jager?</i>

21:20.780 --> 21:21.946
<i>  And stay tuned</i>

21:21.948 --> 21:23.881
<i>  for the main event</i>
<i>  of the evening</i>

21:23.883 --> 21:26.417
<i>  where defending</i>
<i>  champion, end game,</i>

21:26.419 --> 21:28.386
<i>  will look to get</i>
<i>  underneath the skin</i>

21:28.388 --> 21:30.721
<i>  of the wily witch doctor.</i>

21:30.723 --> 21:34.592
<i>  That's later tonight</i>
<i>  on battlebots.</i>

21:42.302 --> 21:43.401
[applause]

21:43.403 --> 21:46.003
we continue on here
on battlebots

21:46.005 --> 21:50.274
and p1 steps inside
the box for the second time
this season,

21:50.276 --> 21:52.376
<i>  and they will be</i>
<i>  taking on jager,</i>

21:52.378 --> 21:54.812
<i>  a rookie bot out of germany.</i>

21:54.814 --> 21:57.281
<i>  As for p1 captain</i>
<i>  brandon zalinsky,</i>

21:57.283 --> 21:59.350
<i>  this is a crossroads moment.</i>

22:00.320 --> 22:02.019
<i>  After an upset victory</i>

22:02.021 --> 22:05.222
<i>  over last season's</i>
<i>  most destructive bot,</i>
<i>  valkyrie,</i>

22:05.224 --> 22:09.026
<i>  brandon's coming off arguably</i>
<i> the biggest win of his career.</i>

22:09.028 --> 22:12.263
<i>  So, the question</i>
<i>  can he make it a trend</i>
<i>  and go 2 an 0, kenny?</i>

22:12.265 --> 22:14.332
<i> [kenny] well, we know</i>
<i>  brandon came into this season</i>

22:14.334 --> 22:19.236
<i>  with a huge chip</i>
<i>  on his shoulder after not</i>
<i>  making the round of 32</i>

22:19.238 --> 22:22.206
<i>  due to a week</i>
<i>  strict of schedule</i>
<i>  but with the win here</i>

22:22.208 --> 22:24.308
<i> to match his impressive debut,</i>

22:24.310 --> 22:26.310
<i>  he would put himself</i>
<i>  in a great position</i>

22:26.312 --> 22:28.112
<i> to make this year's tournament</i>

22:28.114 --> 22:31.749
<i>  and prove p1 is a team</i>
<i>  to be reckoned with.</i>

22:31.751 --> 22:35.119
Taking on a rookie bot named
jager, it's very interesting.

22:35.121 --> 22:38.222
<i>  It's a multi-bot, meaning</i>
<i>  it's 2 separate robots</i>

22:38.224 --> 22:42.126
<i>  in this case, both weighing</i>
<i>  in around 125 pounds.</i>

22:42.128 --> 22:44.762
<i>  The idea here</i>
<i>  is that fighting 2 bots</i>

22:44.764 --> 22:46.530
<i>  and a variety of weapons</i>

22:46.532 --> 22:49.700
<i>  is more difficult</i>
<i>  than dealing with just one.</i>

22:49.702 --> 22:50.935
<i>  But the truth is,</i>

22:50.937 --> 22:53.170
<i>  multi bots haven't enjoyed</i>
<i>  much success here</i>

22:53.172 --> 22:55.172
<i>  at battlebots, kenny.</i>

22:55.174 --> 22:57.908
<i> [kenny] yeah, it's</i>
<i>  a really cool idea in theory.</i>

22:57.910 --> 23:00.144
<i>  We've seen similar teams</i>
<i>  like gemini</i>

23:00.146 --> 23:01.879
<i>  and the four horsemen</i>
<i>  in years past,</i>

23:01.881 --> 23:04.648
<i>  but ultimately</i>
<i>  a 150 pound robot</i>

23:04.650 --> 23:07.885
<i>  getting hit</i>
<i>  by a 250 pound robot,</i>

23:07.887 --> 23:11.122
<i>  you don't need to be</i>
<i>  an engineer to guess</i>
<i>  how that usually ends.</i>

23:11.124 --> 23:13.691
<i>  Let's see if rookie captain,</i>
<i>  ralf schneider,</i>

23:13.693 --> 23:15.960
<i> can crack the code with jager.</i>

23:16.796 --> 23:18.028
[audience cheering and
applauding]

23:18.030 --> 23:19.764
[chris]
<i>  both teams</i>
<i>  are all wrapped up</i>

23:19.766 --> 23:22.099
<i>  and ready to go</i>

<i>  Let's get you</i>
<i>  straight into the action.</i>

<i>  and kenny.</i>

23:34.180 --> 23:37.181
<i>  He actually has three robots</i>
<i>  in the mix tonight.</i>

23:37.183 --> 23:38.249
<i> [kenny] that's right,</i>

23:38.317 --> 23:40.384
<i>  he brought an under cutter</i>
<i>  named toe kicker,</i>

23:40.386 --> 23:42.787
<i>  a hammer saw</i>
<i>  called arm muscle,</i>

23:42.789 --> 23:43.954
<i>  and a wedge mini bot</i>

23:43.956 --> 23:46.290
<i> that apparently didn't deserve</i>
<i>  a cool name.</i>

23:46.292 --> 23:49.460
<i>  If battlebots is a game</i>
<i>  of rock, paper, scissors,</i>

23:49.462 --> 23:51.729
<i>  jager is trying</i>
<i>  to be all three.</i>

23:53.900 --> 23:55.666
[robot] blue team, ready.

23:57.370 --> 23:59.737
<i> [chris] kenny,</i>
<i>  brandon zalinsky built p1</i>

23:59.739 --> 24:01.405
<i>  to look kind of</i>
<i>  like a race car</i>

24:01.407 --> 24:05.609
<i>  and it looked</i>
<i> as the fastest one in that win</i>
<i>  over valkyrie.</i>

24:05.611 --> 24:08.245
[kenny]
<i>  no doubt the one two punch</i>
<i>  of p1's speed</i>

24:08.247 --> 24:10.881
<i>  and low profile</i>
<i>  allowed it to dominate</i>

24:10.883 --> 24:12.416
<i> the ground game in that match.</i>

24:12.418 --> 24:15.085
<i>  Brandon plan to take</i>
<i>  the same approach here.</i>

24:15.087 --> 24:16.921
<i>  Let's see</i>
<i>  how he handles the chaos</i>

24:48.955 --> 24:51.255
<i>  P1 takes out the mini bot,</i>

<i>  but the little guy</i>
<i>  comes bouncing back</i>

<i>  and gets underneath p1.</i>

24:54.927 --> 24:57.962
<i> [kenny] uh-oh. That mini-bot</i>
<i>  has high center p1.</i>

24:57.964 --> 24:59.230
<i> [chris] oh, uh-oh!</i>

<i> [kenny] and that hammer saw</i>

<i>  but here is p1 battling back,</i>

25:12.778 --> 25:15.479
<i>  always a challenge to decide</i>

<i> [chris] oh! P1 rocks</i>
<i>  the advance by</i>
<i>  the undercutter,</i>

25:27.193 --> 25:29.560
<i>  it kind of put it</i>
<i>  in the friend zone.</i>

25:30.796 --> 25:32.396
<i> [kenny] looks like</i>
<i>  jager's hammer saw</i>

25:32.398 --> 25:34.231
<i>  is having</i>
<i>  trouble riding itself</i>

25:34.233 --> 25:36.734
<i>  as p1 drives</i>
<i>  the undercutter toe kicker</i>

<i>  both of the 125 pound bots</i>
<i>  in order</i>
<i>  to register a knockout.</i>

25:47.280 --> 25:49.313
[kenny]
<i>  yeah, let's see</i>
<i>  if toe kicker can try</i>

25:49.315 --> 25:51.682
<i>  to bring his other buddy here</i>
<i>  back to life.</i>

25:51.684 --> 25:53.317
<i>  Oh, get him up</i>
<i>  on the upper deck.</i>

25:53.319 --> 25:54.852
-Oh, let's go!
-Tow them out.

<i> -[chris] that is impressive.</i>
<i> -[kenny] brilliant!</i>

<i> [chris] and I am not too sure</i>
<i> if that robot can work its way</i>

<i>  off of the upper deck.</i>

Five, four...

26:11.404 --> 26:13.437

<i> He's back.</i>

26:15.908 --> 26:18.142
<i> [chris] oh, jager,</i>
<i>  slips off the upper deck.</i>

26:18.144 --> 26:21.946
<i>  And stops the countdown</i>
<i>  just in time.</i>
<i>  That was amazing.</i>

26:21.948 --> 26:26.050
<i> [kenny] check out the mini-bot</i>
<i>  stuck to the front of p1.</i>

26:26.052 --> 26:28.319
<i> [chris] but not anymore</i>
<i>  as toe kicker</i>

26:28.321 --> 26:30.387
<i>  goes from reeling</i>
<i>  into both bots,</i>

26:30.389 --> 26:32.990
<i>  p1 right back on top of it.</i>

26:32.992 --> 26:34.291
<i> [kenny] wow.</i>

26:34.293 --> 26:37.127
<i> [chris] so only one of the two</i>
<i>  big bots has been dismantled.</i>

26:37.129 --> 26:41.031
<i>  So now it's about half</i>
<i>  the size of p1</i>

26:41.033 --> 26:42.399
<i> - that is going to try and...</i>
<i> -[kenny] oh.</i>

26:42.401 --> 26:45.336
<i> [chris] ...Stick around</i>
<i>  for another minute.</i>

26:45.338 --> 26:47.104
<i> [kenny] now this is a problem,</i>
<i>  you know,</i>

26:47.106 --> 26:49.106
<i>  when you're having</i>
<i>  mass versus mass,</i>

26:49.108 --> 26:53.377
<i> you have 125 pound robot going</i>
<i>  to get a 250 pounds robot,</i>

26:53.379 --> 26:55.079
<i>  it's kind of</i>
<i>  like manny pacquiao</i>

26:55.081 --> 26:57.047
<i>  trying to contend</i>
<i>  with mike tyson.</i>

26:57.049 --> 26:58.082
<i>  Good luck.</i>

26:59.118 --> 27:02.152
<i> [chris] and look at p1</i>
<i>  doing yeoman's work,</i>

27:02.154 --> 27:05.689
<i>  trying to get that bot</i>
<i>  back up on the upper deck.</i>

27:05.691 --> 27:06.890
<i> [kenny] all over him.</i>

27:06.892 --> 27:10.861
<i> [chris] can he do it?</i>
<i>  Oh, uh-oh.</i>

27:10.863 --> 27:13.731
<i>  Little smoke,</i>
<i>  good use of the flipper.</i>

27:13.733 --> 27:15.866
<i> [kenny] look at that</i>
<i>  placement there, chris.</i>

27:15.868 --> 27:17.368
<i> [chris] so impressive.</i>

27:17.370 --> 27:20.237

<i>  to get its wheels</i>
<i>  back on the ground,</i>

<i> even utilizing its own weapon.</i>

27:25.077 --> 27:26.443
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

27:26.445 --> 27:28.812
[chris]
<i>  now the countdown</i>

-[chris] and this time.

27:30.549 --> 27:33.517
-Two, one.

<i>  I got to give p1</i>
<i>  some serious credit,</i>

<i>  if that was me</i>
<i>  in the center of that box,</i>

27:49.769 --> 27:51.168
<i>  my head would be spinning.</i>

27:51.170 --> 27:52.970

<i>  which one to go after.</i>

27:52.972 --> 27:54.238
<i> [kenny] no doubt about it.</i>

27:54.240 --> 27:56.940
<i>  And jager got off</i>
<i> to a great start in this fight</i>

27:56.942 --> 27:59.376
<i>  high centering p1</i>
<i>  with its mini-bot</i>

27:59.378 --> 28:01.812
<i>  and then landing a shot</i>
<i>  with arm muscle,</i>

28:01.814 --> 28:03.714
<i>  its hammer saw.</i>

28:03.716 --> 28:06.717
[chris]
<i>  but from that point on,</i>
<i>  it was all p1</i>

28:06.719 --> 28:08.385
<i>  utilizing its signature speed</i>

28:08.387 --> 28:12.089
<i>  and ground scraping wedge</i>
<i>  to get underneath arm muscle</i>

28:12.091 --> 28:16.126
<i>  and even its lifter to punch</i>
<i>  jager's undercut toe kicker</i>

28:16.128 --> 28:17.961
<i>  onto the upper deck.</i>

28:17.963 --> 28:20.064
[kenny]
<i>  a great display of control</i>

28:20.066 --> 28:21.999
<i>  by brandon zalinsky</i>
<i>  in this fight.</i>

28:22.001 --> 28:23.333
<i>  Jager hung in there</i>

28:23.335 --> 28:25.936
<i>  and almost made it</i>
<i>  to the full three minutes,</i>

28:25.938 --> 28:27.905
<i>  but in the end,</i>
<i>  you saw the danger</i>

28:27.907 --> 28:30.374
<i>  of bringing a multi-bot</i>
<i>  to the party, chris.</i>

28:30.376 --> 28:32.276
[chris]
<i>  yeah,</i>
<i>  once you lose that first bot,</i>

28:32.278 --> 28:33.977
<i>  it's only a matter of time.</i>

28:33.979 --> 28:36.980
<i>  You know, jager means</i>
<i>  hunter in german, kenny,</i>

28:36.982 --> 28:39.616
<i>  but it was p1's prey</i>
<i>  in this one.</i>

28:42.154 --> 28:43.587
[audience cheering]

28:43.589 --> 28:44.955
<i> [chris] brandon zelinsky.</i>

28:44.957 --> 28:46.390
[laughs]

28:46.392 --> 28:48.358
brandon zelinsky,
you're all smiles.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.228
Is that the best driving
you've ever done?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.163
Um, I want the best...

28:53.165 --> 28:54.965
I want the best driving
I've ever done

28:54.967 --> 28:56.166
to be in my next fight.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.135
Just get better
every single fight.

28:58.137 --> 29:02.339
So what was it like
facing multiple bots
at the same time?

29:02.341 --> 29:03.407
Was it a little confusing?

29:03.409 --> 29:05.042
Uh. It was hard.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.177
I was trying to focus
on the horizontal initially,

29:07.179 --> 29:09.346
but you have a plan
and then you start fighting

29:09.348 --> 29:11.048
and then it's like,
oh, the robot is over here,

29:11.050 --> 29:12.316
so I'm going
to start hitting him.

29:12.318 --> 29:15.152
The lift by his mini-bot
I did not see coming.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.321
It's an incredibly powerful
little robot.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.423
I was scared
for quite a bit there

29:19.425 --> 29:21.458
that they would be able
to take a wheel off

29:21.460 --> 29:22.793
or something like that.

29:22.795 --> 29:23.827
But once we got off,

29:23.829 --> 29:26.063
we were able
to kind of control the fight.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.866
We were able to get the...
The top attack knocked over

29:28.868 --> 29:30.234
and we... We were able

29:30.236 --> 29:32.503
to kind of just maybe get
the horizontal

29:32.505 --> 29:34.538
onto the shelf and not quite.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.040
You guys keep getting better.
Congratulations.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.175
Thank you so much.

<i> [chris] okay, so p1</i>
<i>  notches win number two</i>

29:46.252 --> 29:49.353
<i>  in what's quickly becoming</i>
<i>  a breakout season.</i>

29:49.355 --> 29:51.989
<i>  Keep an eye out for whether</i>
<i>  the committee rewards them</i>

29:51.991 --> 29:55.959
<i>  with a marquee match up</i>
<i>  in their third</i>

29:58.130 --> 29:59.062
<i>  Coming up,</i>

29:59.064 --> 30:01.198
<i>  the most feared flipper</i>
<i>  in the galaxy.</i>

30:01.200 --> 30:05.736
<i>  Hydra is backed into a corner</i>
<i>  and desperate for a victory.</i>

30:05.738 --> 30:09.106
<i>  Standing in its way</i>
<i>  about the hard to kill</i>

30:09.108 --> 30:12.176
<i>  and will melt your grill,</i>
<i>  that's gruff.</i>

30:12.178 --> 30:15.345
<i> And that's next on battlebots.</i>

30:19.318 --> 30:20.584
[audience cheering]

30:21.554 --> 30:23.487
[chris]
<i>  welcome back to battlebots.</i>

30:23.489 --> 30:25.956
<i>  We've got three matches</i>
<i>  in the books here</i>

30:25.958 --> 30:27.691
<i>  on tonight's fight card.</i>

30:27.693 --> 30:30.828
<i>  And up next it is hydra</i>
<i>  versus gruff.</i>

30:30.830 --> 30:31.962
[audience cheering]

30:31.964 --> 30:34.264
<i>  last year's number</i>
<i>  one seed, hydra</i>

30:34.266 --> 30:36.934
<i>  and captain jake ewert</i>
<i>  make their money</i>

30:36.936 --> 30:39.336
<i>  dominating what</i>
<i>  builders like to refer to</i>

30:39.338 --> 30:41.705
<i>  as the ground game, kenny.</i>

30:41.707 --> 30:43.707
<i> [kenny] it's crucial</i>
<i>  for their success,</i>

30:43.709 --> 30:44.908
<i>  but not just for them.</i>

30:44.910 --> 30:46.944
<i>  So many bots</i>
<i>  in the field depend</i>

30:46.946 --> 30:48.846
<i>  on getting under</i>
<i>  their opponents.</i>

30:48.848 --> 30:50.514
<i>  It's an engineering challenge</i>

30:50.516 --> 30:54.017
<i> that comes down to not inches,</i>
<i>  but millimeters.</i>

30:57.389 --> 30:59.857
For 50% of the bots,
the game is played

30:59.859 --> 31:02.526
on the front edge
of your weapon.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.962
Forks, wedge,
there's a lot of advantages

31:04.964 --> 31:07.431
to being able to get
underneath another robot.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.367
[jack]
<i>  if you can get</i>
<i>  under the opponent,</i>

31:10.369 --> 31:12.069
you can control them.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.904
<i> [chris] oh!</i>

31:13.906 --> 31:16.139
<i> [kenny] hydra is just so low</i>
<i>  to the ground chris,</i>

31:16.141 --> 31:18.242
<i>  they're dominating</i>
<i>  this fight right now.</i>

31:18.244 --> 31:20.110
You can lift them
off the ground,

31:20.112 --> 31:22.279
drive them around,
take them wherever you want.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.680
If you're a vertical spinner,

31:23.682 --> 31:25.315
then you're placing them
right at the sweet spot.

31:25.317 --> 31:30.120
<i> -[chris] my gosh!</i>
<i> -[kenny] end game</i>
<i>  showing the low-end wins.</i>

31:30.122 --> 31:32.689
Whoever is the lowest, whoever
makes that first contact

31:32.691 --> 31:34.424
is going to win
the rest of the match.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.994
It could be easily
decide in 10 seconds.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.462
<i> [kenny] jamison go told us</i>

31:38.464 --> 31:40.464
<i>  this will be a battle</i>
<i>  for low ground, it is.</i>

31:40.466 --> 31:42.099
<i>  What do you got chris?</i>

31:42.101 --> 31:44.134
<i> [jack] if you don't have</i>
<i>  a ground game,</i>

31:44.136 --> 31:46.370
you're going to be
in a world of hurt usually.

31:51.076 --> 31:54.011
This wedge
we grind this flat angle

31:54.013 --> 31:56.046
across the front of it.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.482
And hopefully anything
that comes in at it

31:58.484 --> 31:59.917
will just be lifted up.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.385
[chris]
<i>  jack barker on the attack,</i>

32:01.387 --> 32:03.120
<i>  a nice shot on rotator.</i>

32:03.122 --> 32:05.122
<i> [victor] rotator was</i>
<i>  not really designed to like</i>

32:05.124 --> 32:08.191
use forks or be able
to push other robots around.

32:08.193 --> 32:09.693
It was just to meant
to do damage.

32:09.695 --> 32:12.496
<i> [chris] rotator retreat</i>
<i>  and that blade still spinning</i>

32:12.498 --> 32:14.598
<i>  and now going for a ride.</i>

32:15.901 --> 32:17.334
[victor]
<i>  last year, we had beta</i>

32:17.336 --> 32:19.336
just giving us a ride
around the arena.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.271
<i>  Now how do we fix that?</i>

32:21.273 --> 32:23.106
<i>  If you prevent the robot</i>
<i>  from getting underneath you,</i>

32:23.108 --> 32:24.374
<i>  they can't control you.</i>

32:24.376 --> 32:26.376
So now there's this kind
of escalation

32:26.378 --> 32:29.546
of ground scraping claws
and forks.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.049
Fork extremity is getting
longer and longer

32:32.051 --> 32:33.317
and sharper and sharper.

32:33.319 --> 32:36.887
Every match we have
curls of the arena floor

32:36.889 --> 32:39.990
that we have to actually
peel off the ends of our forks

32:39.992 --> 32:42.759
just because we plain
that thing so smooth.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.161
[angle grinding]

32:44.163 --> 32:46.897
there are definitely
some risks in trying
to play the low game.

32:46.899 --> 32:48.999
[kenny]
<i>  end game hung up</i>
<i>  on something chris.</i>

32:49.001 --> 32:51.268
[chris]
<i>  no, it is a sitting duck</i>
<i>  at this point.</i>

32:51.270 --> 32:53.370
<i> [jack] the kill saws,</i>
<i>  the hell raises,</i>

32:53.372 --> 32:54.805
<i>  even the floor seems</i>

32:54.807 --> 32:56.907
you can get stuck in them
if you're not careful.

32:56.909 --> 32:58.942
We've really tried
to resist the ground game

32:58.944 --> 33:00.844
with witch doctor
as long as we can.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.379
<i>  Some of our</i>
<i>  best characteristics</i>

33:02.381 --> 33:04.381
<i>  are that we're super</i>
<i>  maneuverable and</i>
<i>  super aggressive,</i>

33:04.383 --> 33:06.383
and we don't want
to lose that with the forks.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.852
This is battlebots,
we want to fight with weapons.

33:08.854 --> 33:11.288
<i> [chris] sawblaze winning</i>
<i>  the low ground battle.</i>

33:11.290 --> 33:15.225
<i>  Witch doctor doesn't care.</i>
<i>  They've just going on attack.</i>

33:15.227 --> 33:16.326
<i> [andrea] but at the same time,</i>

33:16.328 --> 33:17.961
we can be eliminated
from the tournament

33:17.963 --> 33:19.096
because we don't have forks,

33:19.098 --> 33:20.364
so we're not watching
what's happening,

33:20.366 --> 33:21.898
so we have to react to that.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.500
<i>  It's a delicate balance</i>
<i>  you've got to ride.</i>

33:23.502 --> 33:25.869
Too much if you go too far,

33:25.871 --> 33:28.071
it's going to be
really difficult for you.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.540
<i> [chris] hydra getting</i>
<i>  stuck on the floor a bit,</i>

33:30.542 --> 33:34.244
<i>  now looking to engage,</i>
<i>  gets underneath end game.</i>

33:34.246 --> 33:36.113
<i>  Oh, look at that!</i>

33:36.115 --> 33:37.381
<i> [jake] I don't care</i>
<i>  if I can't make it</i>

33:37.383 --> 33:39.149
<i>  off the four by four square.</i>

33:39.151 --> 33:40.317
<i> I don't want to lose that war.</i>

33:40.319 --> 33:42.252
I'm going to have to keep
on sharper and sharper

33:42.254 --> 33:45.956
and then eventually
I won't be able to get out
of my starting blocks,

33:45.958 --> 33:48.291
but he is still got to try
to beat me there.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.397
[chris]
<i>  over the last few seasons</i>

33:53.399 --> 33:57.134
<i>  hydra laid claim to being</i>
<i>  the lowest bot in the field,</i>

33:57.136 --> 33:58.835
<i>  but last year it was end game</i>

33:58.837 --> 34:00.270

<i>  to March all the way</i>
<i>  to the giant nut.</i>

<i>  And after the defending champ</i>
<i>  put hydra in an 0-1 hole</i>

34:13.252 --> 34:15.352
<i> [kenny] yeah, jake</i>
<i>  is definitely not impressed</i>

34:15.354 --> 34:17.754
<i>  with how hydra performed</i>
<i>  in that first fight,</i>

34:17.756 --> 34:20.190
<i>  and he's certainly not okay</i>
<i>  with going 0-2.</i>

34:20.192 --> 34:22.993
<i>  He wants to use hydra's</i>
<i>  advantage in the ground game</i>

34:22.995 --> 34:24.094
<i>  to get under gruff</i>

34:24.096 --> 34:27.164

<i>  a victory in this matchup.</i>

34:27.166 --> 34:29.366
<i> [chris] gruff, of course,</i>
<i>  the lifter bot</i>

34:29.368 --> 34:31.201

<i>  against last year's</i>
<i>  number one tournament seed</i>

<i>  in the round of 32.</i>

34:45.317 --> 34:46.316
<i> [kenny] oh for sure.</i>

<i>  After a debut win</i>

<i>  gruff is now facing</i>
<i>  the cream of the crop</i>
<i>  in hydra,</i>

34:52.191 --> 34:56.093
<i>  but it is an opportunity here</i>
<i>  to put hydra to the test</i>

34:56.095 --> 34:58.261
<i>  after the flipper faced</i>
<i>  mechanical issues</i>

34:58.263 --> 34:59.429
<i>  in that first fight.</i>

<i>  Should be a good one.</i>

and then we'll be cruising
at about 35,000 feet.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.956
It's going to be a bumpy ride,
so buckle up.

35:25.958 --> 35:28.158

around to take your orders

35:28.160 --> 35:29.326

of a crash landing,

35:31.163 --> 35:33.430
sit back, relax
and enjoy your demise.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.442
this bot is named
after a kid's book

36:19.444 --> 36:21.278
that's pretty legendary.

36:21.280 --> 36:25.282
Oh, the places you'll go
like inside the cemetery.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.185
Going against him, you're
definitely going to perish,

36:28.187 --> 36:32.556
you must have one fish,
two fish, bluefish,
death wish.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.926
Give it up for gruff!

36:42.134 --> 36:45.802
<i>  Gruff, a pair of oven mitts</i>
<i>  covering the robot there,</i>

36:45.804 --> 36:49.172
<i>  because that's just how</i>
<i>  powerful its flamethrower is.</i>

36:49.174 --> 36:52.709
<i>  How's it going to handle</i>
<i> being airborne, though, kenny?</i>

36:52.711 --> 36:54.711
<i> [kenny] well, we've said it</i>
<i>  over and over</i>

36:54.713 --> 36:56.413
<i>  that gruff</i>
<i>  is built like a tank,</i>

36:56.415 --> 36:58.882
<i>  but this should be</i>
<i>  a very different test</i>

36:58.884 --> 37:00.350
<i>  of the bot's durability.</i>

37:00.352 --> 37:02.485
<i>  We know it can survive</i>
<i>  massive collisions,</i>

37:02.487 --> 37:03.720
<i>  but that only matters</i>

37:03.722 --> 37:05.689
<i>  if they're not flipped</i>
<i>  onto their head.</i>

37:05.691 --> 37:07.257
<i>  Sam will have to make sure</i>

37:07.259 --> 37:11.094
<i>  those forks are equally</i>
<i>  as useful as a self-righter,</i>

37:11.096 --> 37:13.163
<i>  as they are</i>
<i>  as a primary weapon.</i>

37:13.165 --> 37:16.366

37:18.403 --> 37:20.136
<i>  we're going</i>
<i>  against gruff today,</i>

37:20.138 --> 37:22.038
<i>  and although he's not</i>
<i>  a big spinner,</i>

37:22.040 --> 37:24.207
<i>  which I'm usually going</i>
<i>  to have to go against,</i>

37:24.209 --> 37:25.442
<i>  it could be</i>
<i>  a driving battle today.</i>

37:25.444 --> 37:27.244
<i>  So it's going to be</i>
<i>  a little bit of a fun one.</i>

37:27.246 --> 37:29.846
<i>  Last fight against</i>
<i>  end game was bad.</i>

37:29.848 --> 37:33.116
<i>  Our pump went out right away,</i>
<i>  so I gave him a freebie</i>

37:33.118 --> 37:35.885
<i>  but hopefully this time</i>
<i>  our pump works the whole time</i>

37:35.887 --> 37:36.953
<i>  and we can just, you know,</i>

37:36.955 --> 37:38.822
<i>  go for the record</i>
<i>  number of flips.</i>

37:38.824 --> 37:40.690
<i>  We're going to go</i>
<i>  for 30 this match.</i>

37:40.692 --> 37:43.526
<i>  We're one and 0 right now.</i>
<i>  Basically, if we win,</i>
<i>  we're in.</i>

37:43.528 --> 37:46.463
<i> Our plan is to try to position</i>
<i>  ourselves between hydra</i>

37:46.465 --> 37:49.733
<i>  and the upper deck</i>
<i>  so that if he does flip us,</i>

37:49.735 --> 37:51.368
<i>  we go on that</i>
<i>  and we have a chance</i>

37:51.370 --> 37:53.169
<i>  to kind of recover</i>
<i>  and reposition.</i>

37:53.171 --> 37:54.771
<i>  Whereas if he not launches us</i>

37:54.773 --> 37:56.439
<i>  against like one</i>
<i>  of the regular walls</i>
<i>  of the arena,</i>

37:56.441 --> 37:59.175
<i>  those new guards</i>
<i>  are going to basically</i>
<i>  just knock us down</i>

37:59.177 --> 38:00.710
<i>  and let him flip,</i>
<i>  keep flipping us.</i>

38:00.712 --> 38:01.978
<i>  If he gets us</i>
<i>  on the upper deck,</i>

38:01.980 --> 38:03.446
<i>  it give us a chance</i>
<i>  to kind of regroup</i>

38:03.448 --> 38:05.649

41:44.069 --> 41:46.302
<i>  jake ewert</i>
<i>  isn't going to be satisfied</i>

41:46.304 --> 41:47.337
<i>  with his performance.</i>

41:47.339 --> 41:48.304
<i>  Will he?</i>

41:48.306 --> 41:50.073
<i> [kenny] I'm not so sure chris.</i>

41:50.075 --> 41:52.709
<i>  Hydra connected</i>
<i>  on a ton of flips</i>
<i>  in this match,</i>

41:52.711 --> 41:54.777
<i>  16 to be exact.</i>

41:54.779 --> 41:56.012
<i>  But to your point,</i>

41:56.014 --> 41:57.881
<i>  that weapon</i>
<i>  is still lacking the pop</i>

41:57.883 --> 42:01.317
<i>  that made it such a force</i>
<i>  to be reckoned with</i>
<i>  last season.</i>

42:02.821 --> 42:05.955
<i> [chris] either way, jake ewert</i>
<i>  did an excellent job of using</i>

42:05.957 --> 42:10.960
<i>  the box hazards</i>
<i>  to his advantage</i>
<i> and drove one heck of a fight.</i>

42:10.962 --> 42:13.796
<i> [kenny] tossed gruff</i>
<i> around the box into the screws</i>

42:13.798 --> 42:15.198
<i>  and just when it looked like</i>

42:15.200 --> 42:17.100
<i>  this one was going</i>
<i>  to go the distance</i>

42:17.102 --> 42:19.869
<i>  hydra ended it</i>
<i>  in dramatic fashion.</i>

42:19.871 --> 42:22.972
<i> [chris] flipping gruff</i>
<i>  right out of the arena.</i>

42:22.974 --> 42:25.575
<i>  Now that's</i>
<i>  how you make a statement.</i>

<i>  on win number</i>
<i>  one of the season.</i>

42:33.218 --> 42:34.951
Kenny and I have a little bet.

42:36.221 --> 42:38.721
Kenny thinks you're thrilled.

42:38.723 --> 42:39.923
I think you're not,

42:39.925 --> 42:43.226
because that's...
Explain to me why I won.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.495
It needs to be way up here.
Yeah.

42:45.497 --> 42:47.363
We don't know
why it wasn't flipping.

42:47.365 --> 42:49.332
It flipped before
on the test box,

42:49.334 --> 42:51.467
so, I mean, it's glad
I could control him enough

42:51.469 --> 42:53.236
during the match,

42:53.238 --> 42:56.072
but I really wanted to get him
at least up on the shelf

42:56.074 --> 42:57.507
or at least, you know,

42:57.509 --> 43:00.376
eight foot high,
it would have been nicer, but

43:00.378 --> 43:02.845
I'm glad
I made you guys wait, wait.

43:02.847 --> 43:04.314
I'm going to be that guy.
Oh, yeah, I'm not.

43:04.316 --> 43:06.282
Does this... Does this
concern you a little bit?

43:06.284 --> 43:08.184
Well, hopefully
we can figure it out, right?

43:08.186 --> 43:09.986
I mean, it still works

43:09.988 --> 43:12.822
the way it is but I'd
like to be able to damage
people when they come down.

43:12.824 --> 43:14.857
I use gravity to beat them,
so.

43:14.859 --> 43:18.995
And based on the performance.
How would you grade
your robot?

43:18.997 --> 43:20.229
It's like an f right now.

43:20.231 --> 43:21.397
-Really?
-Oh.

43:21.399 --> 43:23.166
Yeah, it's pretty low.
It's really is.

43:23.168 --> 43:25.201
Wow. Okay. Very unhappy.

43:25.203 --> 43:27.136
You know you won, right?

43:27.138 --> 43:29.439
Doesn't matter,
you got to be the best, right?

43:29.441 --> 43:31.708
Okay. All right, jake.
Get back in the workshop.

43:31.710 --> 43:34.677

you, guys. See you.

<i>  he'd give himself an f.</i>

43:45.523 --> 43:48.391
I think that
was a little harsh.
Well, I mean, he won.

43:48.393 --> 43:50.460
He got a bunch of flips off

43:50.462 --> 43:53.363
and he just used to
these flawless performances

43:53.365 --> 43:56.232
<i>  where he's launching robots</i>
<i>  like 20 feet up in the air.</i>

<i>  a little harder himself.</i>

43:58.069 --> 44:00.703
<i>  But this is why he's</i>
<i>  one of the best robots</i>
<i>  in the world as well.</i>

44:00.705 --> 44:02.705
But what did he tell us
at the beginning
of the season?

44:02.707 --> 44:04.974
He said this bot
is even better than the one

44:04.976 --> 44:07.810

in the regular season
a year ago.

44:07.812 --> 44:09.145
<i> [kenny] he's having issues,</i>

<i>  and I think that's why</i>

<i>  He put a lot of work</i>
<i>  into this robot</i>

44:12.784 --> 44:14.017
<i>  thinking he was making</i>
<i>  it better,</i>

<i>  And let's start</i>
<i>  with captain shrederator,</i>

45:16.915 --> 45:19.782
<i>  which christened</i>
<i>  the 2021 season</i>

45:19.784 --> 45:22.418
<i>  with a knockout</i>
<i>  of the legendary tombstone.</i>

45:22.420 --> 45:26.189
<i>  Dare I say that brian nave</i>
<i>  has his swag back.</i>

45:26.191 --> 45:29.192
<i> [kenny] swag all day</i>
<i>  for brian nave and for a bot</i>

45:29.194 --> 45:31.728
<i>  that's often struggled</i>
<i>  with reliability,</i>

45:31.730 --> 45:34.030
<i>  captain shrederator</i>
<i>  looked very durable</i>

45:34.032 --> 45:35.098
<i>  in that first match</i>

45:35.100 --> 45:37.400
<i>  and is riding high</i>
<i>  after knocking out</i>

45:37.402 --> 45:40.870
<i> one of the most dangerous bots</i>
<i>  in the entire field.</i>

45:40.872 --> 45:42.405
<i>  Now brian is on cloud nine,</i>

45:42.407 --> 45:44.107

another tough matchup here

<i> [chris] yeah, the other side</i>

<i>  sits gigabyte</i>
<i>  and john mladenik,</i>

45:49.948 --> 45:51.314
<i>  and I think</i>
<i>  they're still stunned</i>

45:51.316 --> 45:52.882
<i> based on what happened to them</i>

45:52.884 --> 45:54.684
<i>  in their first fight</i>

46:01.993 --> 46:03.025

<i>  through the son of whyachi</i>
<i>  bounty tournament</i>

46:06.931 --> 46:09.232

<i>  a legend.</i>

<i>  this bot made a huge jump</i>
<i>  in durability last season.</i>

<i>  in gigabyte's ability</i>

we were going in
ham underneath and, you know,

53:46.424 --> 53:47.890
just didn't get a chance
to execute

53:47.892 --> 53:49.792
because of electronics again.

53:49.794 --> 53:51.393
At battlebots,
you can experience

53:51.395 --> 53:53.729
the highest highs
and the lowest lows here.

53:53.731 --> 53:56.098
Coming off maybe
one of the biggest wins

53:56.100 --> 53:57.833
you guys have had
against tombstone,

53:57.835 --> 53:59.335
how are you feeling right now?

53:59.337 --> 54:01.870
Yeah, lowest lows is probably
a good way to explain it.

54:01.872 --> 54:04.006
Yeah. We really expected
to win this one.

54:04.008 --> 54:05.374
I think we had
the right strategy,

54:05.376 --> 54:07.409
but once again,
our equipment lets us down.

54:07.411 --> 54:10.946
So what are you going to do?
Come back and win again right?

54:10.948 --> 54:12.715
Well, you are 1-1.

54:12.717 --> 54:14.250
1-1, could be worse.

54:14.252 --> 54:17.987
Another victory might catapult
you into the round of 32.

54:17.989 --> 54:19.054
How much pressure

54:19.056 --> 54:21.790
is there
on captain shrederator
moving forward?

54:21.792 --> 54:23.892
Yeah, well, there would be
a lot less pressure
if we'd have won,

54:23.894 --> 54:26.095
but now we're under the
gun again and we got to

54:26.097 --> 54:29.265
just get out there and
work hard and get another
win under our belt.

54:29.267 --> 54:30.332
No question
you can handle it.

54:30.334 --> 54:31.867
Brian nave,
thank you very much.

54:31.869 --> 54:35.271
-Thank you, guys.

<i> [chris] so gigabyte gets</i>
<i>  a much needed w,</i>

54:43.180 --> 54:44.947
<i>  but clearly john mladenik</i>

54:44.949 --> 54:48.284
<i>  not satisfied with that</i>
<i>  performance at all, kenny.</i>

54:48.286 --> 54:49.985
<i> [kenny] listen in this sport,</i>

54:49.987 --> 54:52.021
<i>  these teams get such precious</i>
<i>  little time</i>

54:52.023 --> 54:53.355
<i>  to impress the committee</i>

54:53.357 --> 54:55.724
<i>  and make their case</i>
<i>  for the top 32.</i>

54:55.726 --> 54:59.695
<i>  And it almost felt</i>
<i>  like gigabyte won that fight</i>
<i>  by default.</i>

54:59.697 --> 55:02.131
<i>  John wanted to put</i>
<i>  on a show here tonight,</i>

55:02.133 --> 55:04.166
<i>  and he didn't have</i>
<i>  the chance to do that,</i>

55:04.168 --> 55:07.069
<i>  regardless, gigabyte</i>
<i>  is 1-1.</i>

55:08.973 --> 55:11.206
<i> [chris] coming up.</i>
<i>  Sure, you could slay dragons,</i>

55:11.208 --> 55:13.075
<i>  but what about ducks!?</i>

55:13.077 --> 55:17.313
It's dragon slayer
versus duck!

55:42.773 --> 55:44.073
<i>  it's a showdown</i>

55:44.075 --> 55:46.842
<i>  of two of the heaviest</i>

55:46.844 --> 55:49.411
<i> as defending champion end game</i>

55:49.413 --> 55:53.082
<i>  goes weapon-to-weapon</i>
<i>  with fan favorite,</i>
<i>  witch doctor.</i>

55:54.151 --> 55:57.553
<i>  Let's take a closer look</i>
<i>  at tonight's main event.</i>

55:58.856 --> 56:01.190
<i>  Oh, huge hit by witch doctor.</i>

56:01.192 --> 56:04.226
We knew against duck! That it
was going to be three minutes,

56:04.228 --> 56:05.861
<i> [chris] oh, nice shot.</i>

56:05.863 --> 56:07.029
Cause duck! Doesn't die.

56:07.031 --> 56:09.365
<i>  Unfortunately, we found out</i>
<i>  after that</i>

56:09.367 --> 56:12.368
we actually read that entire
match was just
one weapon motor.

56:12.370 --> 56:14.203
<i> [chris] with that spinner slow</i>

56:14.205 --> 56:17.306
<i>  and this one's going</i>
<i>  to have to go to judges.</i>

56:17.308 --> 56:19.908
Witch doctor!

56:19.910 --> 56:21.377
Going into our end game match,

56:21.379 --> 56:24.246
this is the first time,
we're going to be
a full power.

56:24.248 --> 56:27.049
<i>  So you're going to see twice</i>
<i>  the level power from us</i>

56:27.051 --> 56:29.084
<i>  and all that reliability</i>
<i>  will be back.</i>

56:29.086 --> 56:33.288
<i> [chris] are you kidding me!</i>
<i>  What a shot by witch doctor.</i>

56:33.290 --> 56:34.523
[electric music playing]

56:35.559 --> 56:38.894
<i> [faruq] end game</i>

56:38.896 --> 56:40.963
<i> [chris] world champion.</i>

56:45.669 --> 56:48.103
After taking out
the number one
seed from last year,

56:48.105 --> 56:51.039
<i> [kenny] oh, that might have</i>
<i>  been a knockout blow, chris.</i>

56:51.041 --> 56:53.342
We're fairly certain
that we're going to make
the tournament already.

56:53.344 --> 56:56.211
<i> [chris] they got that</i>
<i>  world championship swagger.</i>

56:56.213 --> 56:58.347
We have a few things
up our sleeve.

56:58.349 --> 57:01.417
<i>  We think it's going to be</i>
<i>  enough to take down</i>
<i>  witch doctor.</i>

57:02.753 --> 57:04.286
[music playing]

57:04.288 --> 57:07.689
our plan is always
to just stick pointing
at our opponent.

57:07.691 --> 57:10.192
<i> [chris] end game</i>
<i>  stalking its prey.</i>

57:10.194 --> 57:12.961
<i> [jack] yeah, try feed</i>
<i>  the weapon into them.</i>

57:12.963 --> 57:15.063
There's nowhere for them
to run.

57:15.065 --> 57:17.065
<i> [kenny] it is a knockout.</i>

57:18.269 --> 57:21.170
I think end game sits
in the middle of the arena
really well

57:21.172 --> 57:22.971
and points his weapon at you.

57:24.942 --> 57:28.310
So I'm going to try
to outdrive him,
make him make a mistake.

57:28.312 --> 57:30.412
I try to capitalize
on those mistakes.

57:30.414 --> 57:34.016
<i> [chris] oh, another</i>
<i> smashing shot by witch doctor.</i>

57:34.018 --> 57:36.919
Getting the previous champion
for our second fight card

57:36.921 --> 57:39.188
is a tough draw,
but if we win this match,

57:39.190 --> 57:41.290
I think we're a shoo-in
for the tournament.

57:41.292 --> 57:45.961
<i> [chris] oh-ho, I'm feeling</i>
<i>  that voodoo magic.</i>

57:45.963 --> 57:49.131
<i> [nick] you've got</i>
<i>  witch doctor, finalists</i>
<i>  from the 2019 season.</i>

57:49.133 --> 57:50.933
<i> [faruq] witch doctor!</i>

57:50.935 --> 57:52.434
<i> [nick] end game,</i>
<i>  the 2020 champion.</i>

57:52.436 --> 57:54.736
<i> [faruq] end game!</i>

57:54.738 --> 57:56.939
This is going to be
an explosive match.

57:56.941 --> 57:59.208
<i> [commentator] oh,</i>
<i>  what a shot by end game.</i>

57:59.210 --> 58:02.010
This fight is going to be two
of the biggest hitters.

58:02.012 --> 58:04.413
[commentator]
<i>  oh, another big hit</i>
<i>  by witch doctor.</i>

58:04.415 --> 58:06.949
Someone's going to be going
into the air a lot.

58:06.951 --> 58:09.918
[commentator]
<i>  oh, my god, it got</i>
<i>  thrown out of the arena.</i>

58:09.920 --> 58:13.322
One of the two robots is going
to go home in a pile of parts.

58:13.324 --> 58:15.190
Hopefully, it's witch doctor.

58:15.192 --> 58:17.893
-Hopefully it is not us.
-Hopefully it is not us.

58:17.895 --> 58:20.095

58:20.097 --> 58:21.997

to avoid that.

58:21.999 --> 58:23.365

<i> [chris] are you kidding me?</i>

58:27.438 --> 58:29.438
[audience cheering

58:29.440 --> 58:31.206
<i> [chris] two of the best robots</i>

58:31.208 --> 58:34.076
<i>  in the solar system</i>
<i>  in tonight's main event.</i>

58:34.078 --> 58:36.411
<i>  Do not miss that fight.</i>

58:37.515 --> 58:38.580
<i>  But right now,</i>

58:38.582 --> 58:40.215
<i>  it's the veteran duck!</i>

58:40.217 --> 58:43.318
<i>  Versus a newcomer</i>
<i>  to battlebots, dragon slayer.</i>

58:44.488 --> 58:46.288
<i>  And if you take</i>
<i>  a look at duck!,</i>

58:46.290 --> 58:48.790
<i>  which doesn't have</i>
<i>  a traditional weapon,</i>

58:48.792 --> 58:51.426
<i>  hal rucker's approach</i>
<i>  is always pretty simple.</i>

58:51.428 --> 58:54.963
<i>  He wants to break his</i>
<i> opponent's fist with his face.</i>

58:54.965 --> 58:57.933
<i>  It's a strategy that almost</i>
<i>  worked against witch doctor</i>

58:57.935 --> 59:00.903
<i>  when duck!</i>
<i>  Took out their weapon</i>
<i>  in its first fight,</i>

59:00.905 --> 59:03.071
<i>  but ended up losing</i>
<i>  a decision after</i>

59:03.073 --> 59:06.074
<i>  what became a lame duck!</i>
<i>  Pushing match.</i>

59:06.076 --> 59:08.076
<i> [faruq] witch doctor.</i>

59:08.078 --> 59:10.145
<i> [chris] so how does it</i>
<i>  rebound tonight?</i>

59:10.147 --> 59:13.048
It's probably one of the most
defensively sound robots

59:13.050 --> 59:14.683
we have here at battlebots.

59:14.685 --> 59:16.018
It's one of those bots

59:16.020 --> 59:18.887
that you're probably going
to have to go
to decision with.

59:18.889 --> 59:20.722
<i>  Look for duck!</i>
<i>  To use its durability,</i>

59:20.724 --> 59:23.559
<i>  to do what it always does,</i>
<i>  and that's absorb shots,</i>

59:23.561 --> 59:25.460
<i>  try and jam up</i>
<i>  its opponent's weapon</i>

59:25.462 --> 59:27.829
<i>  and ideally be</i>
<i>  the last bot standing.</i>

59:27.831 --> 59:29.698
Curious to see
if they can do better.

59:29.700 --> 59:31.266
All right.
So duck! Is squaring

59:31.268 --> 59:33.368
off against a rookie bot
named dragon slayer

59:33.370 --> 59:36.171
<i>  engineered by jordan neal,</i>
<i>  who got into battlebots</i>

59:36.173 --> 59:39.541
<i>  by watching old vhs tapes</i>
<i>  at his grandparents' house.</i>

59:39.543 --> 59:42.177
<i>  He built his first robot</i>
<i>  while working at a walmart</i>

59:42.179 --> 59:44.479
<i> in 2018, he actually used that</i>
<i>  as a resume</i>

59:44.481 --> 59:46.181
<i>  to eventually</i>
<i>  become a machinist.</i>

59:46.183 --> 59:48.216
<i>  He is super excited</i>
<i>  to be here.</i>

59:48.218 --> 59:50.719
<i> [kenny] he is and he said</i>
<i>  this bot is like three years</i>

59:50.721 --> 59:52.955
<i>  in the making, he's</i>
<i>  been, being mentored</i>

59:52.957 --> 59:54.923
<i>  by jonathan schultz</i>
<i>  of team huge</i>

59:54.925 --> 59:57.693
<i>  and also will bales</i>
<i>  of team hypershock</i>

59:57.695 --> 59:59.928
<i>  and he is so excited</i>
<i>  to be here.</i>

59:59.930 --> 1:00:04.199

got against duck! Faruq?

<i>  to the popular vertical</i>

<i>  our goal is to use</i>

<i>  so we'll use our duck! Beak</i>

<i>  in the opening stretch,</i>

<i>  both bots look at it like</i>
<i>  they need a corner man here.</i>

<i>  They're just... I don't know,</i>

<i> [kenny] yeah, clearly,</i>
<i>  duck! Is having trouble</i>

<i>  till you get inside this box.</i>

<i>  And dragon slayer</i>
<i>  in its first time out,</i>

1:06:33.423 --> 1:06:34.589
<i>  rather impressive,</i>

1:06:34.591 --> 1:06:37.258
<i>  going the distance</i>
<i>  against the veteran.</i>

1:06:39.029 --> 1:06:41.129

<i> [chris] kenny, duck! Came out</i>
<i>  quacking,</i>

<i>  but dragon slayer</i>
<i>  came out attacking</i>
<i>  to start this one.</i>

1:06:51.541 --> 1:06:53.875
<i> [kenny] yeah, how about</i>
<i>  the rookie carving up</i>

1:06:53.877 --> 1:06:56.711
<i>  duck!'s beak</i>
<i>  in the first 10 seconds?</i>

1:06:56.713 --> 1:06:58.913
<i>  Nice shot there</i>
<i>  by jordan neal.</i>

1:06:58.915 --> 1:07:01.082
<i> [chris] dragon slayer</i>
<i>  had its way with duck!</i>

1:07:01.084 --> 1:07:04.919
<i>  For the first minute or so,</i>
<i>  chipping away at the veteran</i>

1:07:04.921 --> 1:07:07.989
<i>  but then both bots</i>
<i>  just kind of hit a wall.</i>

1:07:07.991 --> 1:07:09.257
<i> [kenny] that's right.</i>

1:07:09.292 --> 1:07:12.160
<i> We didn't see the same speedy,</i>
<i>  powerful duck! We're used to.</i>

1:07:12.162 --> 1:07:13.428
<i>  And for dragon slayer,</i>

1:07:13.430 --> 1:07:16.464
<i>  its weapon definitely lost</i>
<i>  some juice down the stretch,</i>

1:07:16.466 --> 1:07:19.567
<i>  but unfortunately for duck!,</i>
<i>  the damage had been done.</i>

1:07:21.071 --> 1:07:22.837
[chris]
<i>  duck! Kept on quacking,</i>

1:07:22.839 --> 1:07:24.706
<i>  but hal rucker</i>
<i>  wasn't able to find</i>

1:07:24.708 --> 1:07:26.975
<i>  any momentum here</i>
<i>  against the rookie.</i>

1:07:26.977 --> 1:07:29.411
<i>  Let's see how the judges</i>
<i>  broke it down.</i>

1:07:29.413 --> 1:07:32.313

jordan neal,
did you ever think

1:08:05.248 --> 1:08:08.416
that you would get
one of those medallions here
at battlebots?

1:08:08.418 --> 1:08:09.717
Absolutely not.

1:08:09.719 --> 1:08:11.519
[kenny laughing]

1:08:11.521 --> 1:08:12.720
oh.

1:08:12.722 --> 1:08:14.155
How happy are you right now?

1:08:14.157 --> 1:08:16.057
Oh, I've been nervous all day,

1:08:16.059 --> 1:08:18.359
haven't been feeling right
past eight hours,

1:08:18.361 --> 1:08:20.695
just butterflies on
top of butterflies, man.

1:08:20.697 --> 1:08:22.197
I had no idea what to expect.

1:08:22.199 --> 1:08:24.165
They told me it was
like riding a bike,

1:08:24.167 --> 1:08:25.733

bike ride of my life.

-That's one way to have fun.
-Amazing.

1:08:37.180 --> 1:08:38.413
Thataway.

Jordan neal,
for years in the making,

1:08:53.196 --> 1:08:54.329
he told us,

1:08:54.331 --> 1:08:55.830
and now he has
realized his dream?

1:08:55.832 --> 1:08:56.998
Yeah, absolutely.

1:08:57.033 --> 1:08:59.434
<i>  Getting a win like that,</i>

<i>  they sink to 0-2</i>

<i>  but with a loss</i>

<i> to the formidable witch doctor</i>
<i>  on their resume,</i>

<i>  the book isn't closed</i>

<i>  in the third and final fight,</i>

1:09:13.917 --> 1:09:15.717

<i> [chris] all right, folks,</i>
<i>  the time has finally arrived</i>

<i>  for the main event</i>
<i>  of the evening,</i>

1:09:23.426 --> 1:09:25.493
<i>  a showdown between</i>
<i>  two of the deadliest</i>

1:09:25.495 --> 1:09:28.029
<i>  vertical spinners</i>
<i>  in the sport,</i>

1:09:28.031 --> 1:09:29.998
<i>  the defending champion,</i>
<i>  end game</i>

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.368
<i>  versus 2019 runner up,</i>
<i>  witch doctor.</i>

1:09:33.370 --> 1:09:36.471
<i>  Only one will walk away</i>
<i>  undefeated.</i>

1:09:36.473 --> 1:09:40.875
<i>  That is next</i>
<i>  as battlebots continues.</i>

1:09:40.877 --> 1:09:42.443
[music playing]

1:09:48.685 --> 1:09:51.319
adam, one of a piece
that makes shatter!

1:09:51.321 --> 1:09:54.689
Very different than
all the rest of these bots
is omni-wheels,

1:09:54.691 --> 1:09:56.457
all directional wheels.

1:09:56.459 --> 1:09:59.561
<i>  Sideways, as well as forward</i>
<i>  and back and turning.</i>

1:09:59.563 --> 1:10:01.863
Why did you choose
such a complex item?

1:10:01.865 --> 1:10:04.899
So that extra
maneuverability for us is key.

1:10:04.901 --> 1:10:07.302
Hammer robots have
one square inch

1:10:07.304 --> 1:10:08.403
where they can hit,

1:10:08.405 --> 1:10:10.772
and we need to put
that square inch exactly

1:10:10.774 --> 1:10:13.274
where the opponent's
fragile components are.

1:10:14.177 --> 1:10:16.211
<i> [chris] oh!</i>
<i>  Look that hammer! Uh-oh!</i>

1:10:16.213 --> 1:10:18.279
<i>  Oh, what a shock.</i>

1:10:18.281 --> 1:10:21.749
And the sideways ability
of the omni-directional drive

1:10:21.751 --> 1:10:24.352
is what allows us to achieve
our pinpoint precision

1:10:24.354 --> 1:10:27.422
[kenny]
<i>  shatter! Is just so precise</i>
<i>  with that hammer, chris.</i>

1:10:27.424 --> 1:10:29.390
<i> [adam] and it's been</i>
<i>  working great for us.</i>

1:10:29.392 --> 1:10:31.259
<i>  That ability to pinpoint</i>
<i>  our shots</i>

1:10:31.261 --> 1:10:34.329
<i>  without relying on tank drive</i>
<i>  has been a huge advantage.</i>

1:10:34.331 --> 1:10:36.364
<i>  I can't go back</i>
<i>  to driving the old way.</i>

1:10:36.366 --> 1:10:37.932
[laughs]

1:10:37.934 --> 1:10:41.002
did you change your car's
wheels out to be
on omni-wheels, too?

1:10:41.004 --> 1:10:42.537
Every time I'm on
the highway,

1:10:42.539 --> 1:10:44.539
I'm a little bit annoyed,
I can't just go sideways.

<i> [kenny] I think so again,</i>
<i> these guys are on fire so far.</i>

1:11:26.483 --> 1:11:29.083
<i>  They're taking on another</i>
<i>  very difficult opponent</i>

1:11:29.085 --> 1:11:30.752
<i>  in witch doctor,</i>
<i>  but, you know,</i>

1:11:30.754 --> 1:11:33.288
beating hydra like they did,
very impressive.

1:11:33.290 --> 1:11:36.424
You know, witch doctor at
the beginning of
the season said,

1:11:36.426 --> 1:11:39.961
<i>  listen, the expectations</i>
<i>  were so high for us in 2020</i>

1:11:39.963 --> 1:11:42.330
<i> because we made it all the way</i>
<i>  to the championship</i>

1:11:42.332 --> 1:11:43.698
<i>  a season ago.</i>

1:11:43.700 --> 1:11:45.166
<i>  Last year,</i>
<i>  we kind of stumbled,</i>

1:11:45.168 --> 1:11:47.402
<i>  even though he made it</i>
<i>  to the round of 16.</i>

1:11:47.404 --> 1:11:49.604
<i>  Now people are going</i>
<i>  to kind of forget about us.</i>

1:11:49.606 --> 1:11:50.772
<i>  That's not true.</i>

1:11:50.774 --> 1:11:51.806
<i>  You're 1-0.</i>

1:11:51.808 --> 1:11:54.008
<i>  You have a chance</i>
<i>  to improve to 2-0</i>

1:11:54.010 --> 1:11:56.878
<i>  with a notch on your belt</i>
<i>  of taking down the champ.</i>

1:11:56.880 --> 1:11:58.313
<i>  This is a big</i>
<i>  matchup for them.</i>

1:11:58.315 --> 1:12:01.382
<i> [kenny] nice try guys trying</i>
<i> to slip in there as underdogs.</i>

1:12:01.384 --> 1:12:03.117
<i>  You are not underdogs.</i>

1:12:03.119 --> 1:12:05.920
You're still very dangerous
and this is an insane fight.

1:12:05.922 --> 1:12:06.954
Let's get to it.

1:12:06.956 --> 1:12:09.657

The only clue that you need

1:12:56.973 --> 1:12:59.874

<i>  Pete, why the long bot?</i>

1:14:49.819 --> 1:14:51.686
Well, mainly that was
to accommodate

1:14:51.688 --> 1:14:56.958
a special dual motor system
that is redundant to allow

1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:59.694
two belts on either side
of the disc as opposed

1:14:59.696 --> 1:15:01.963
to what they used to have,
which was belts in the middle.

1:15:01.965 --> 1:15:04.165
This should give them
a lot more reliability

1:15:04.167 --> 1:15:06.267
to be able
to continue to fight

1:15:06.269 --> 1:15:09.437
even if they lose
one motor or one belt,

1:15:09.439 --> 1:15:11.873
the whole system should
still stay running.

We might be
a little bit, yeah.

1:19:31.567 --> 1:19:34.435
We plan to be,
but we're yet to see

1:19:34.437 --> 1:19:36.904
if it's actually worked
out, so yeah.

1:19:36.906 --> 1:19:41.842
Hey, like we've never
gone like a proper
smash fest before.

1:19:41.844 --> 1:19:44.245
Honestly, like,
most of our fights have ended

1:19:44.247 --> 1:19:48.115
pretty quickly and that was
like at each other constantly.

1:19:48.117 --> 1:19:49.049
That was excellent.

1:19:49.051 --> 1:19:50.785
Jack, how much fun is it

1:19:50.787 --> 1:19:53.454
when you're attacking
a team like witch doctor,

1:19:53.456 --> 1:19:55.322
that, you know,
is that legendary,

1:19:55.324 --> 1:19:56.524
that decorated

1:19:56.526 --> 1:19:58.793
and you're taking
them all through the box?

1:19:58.795 --> 1:20:00.161
It's... It's too stressful

1:20:00.163 --> 1:20:01.996
to think about the fun,
but like when you see

1:20:01.998 --> 1:20:03.030
them flying across the arena,

1:20:03.032 --> 1:20:04.365
you just got to
keep chasing them.

1:20:04.367 --> 1:20:05.833
And that's...
That's probably the best part.

1:20:05.835 --> 1:20:08.002
Trying to line up
the second shots, yeah.

1:20:08.004 --> 1:20:11.238
Finally, jack, what does
it say about end game

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:13.974
that in your first two
matches you took down hydra,

1:20:13.976 --> 1:20:15.843
which was the number
one seed heading

1:20:15.878 --> 1:20:17.812
into the round of
32 a season ago

1:20:17.814 --> 1:20:21.148
and then the 2019 runner up
in witch doctor?

1:20:21.150 --> 1:20:22.349
Yeah,
I think it says good things.

1:20:22.351 --> 1:20:24.285
We're back and
you know,

1:20:24.287 --> 1:20:26.086
we got the nut last year
and that felt pretty good,

1:20:26.088 --> 1:20:27.955
so we're going to try to get
a second one this year.

1:20:27.957 --> 1:20:29.423
Yeah, you think it says
good things about you?

1:20:29.425 --> 1:20:31.892
-Yeah, I, I do agree.
-I think so, yeah.

1:20:31.894 --> 1:20:33.327
Yeah. All right, guys.
Go party on.

1:20:33.329 --> 1:20:35.496
Congratulations with your
2-0 start.

1:20:36.933 --> 1:20:37.932
Yes.

1:20:37.934 --> 1:20:39.366
[audience cheering
and applauding]

1:20:43.406 --> 1:20:45.973
andrea and mike,
you guys have been around

1:20:45.975 --> 1:20:48.843
this game
an awfully long time.

1:20:48.845 --> 1:20:51.979
What are your impressions
of end game so far?

1:20:51.981 --> 1:20:53.948
I mean, end game
is a robot that went

1:20:53.950 --> 1:20:55.883
from never making it
to the tournament

1:20:55.885 --> 1:20:57.484
to going
all the way last year.

1:20:57.486 --> 1:20:59.887
So we were taking
them very, very seriously.

1:20:59.889 --> 1:21:01.989
We know they made
a lot of improvements.

1:21:01.991 --> 1:21:03.390
We really wanted
to win this match

1:21:03.392 --> 1:21:05.492
proving that we
didn't need forks to win

1:21:05.494 --> 1:21:07.461
because forks have gotten
really popular in the sport.

1:21:07.463 --> 1:21:09.196
We did make forks,
so maybe it's time

1:21:09.198 --> 1:21:11.298
to reevaluate that decision.

1:21:11.300 --> 1:21:14.702
[kenny]
early on, it seemed like
it was a really close fight.

1:21:14.704 --> 1:21:16.437
Can you take us
through that fight and tell us

1:21:16.439 --> 1:21:18.439
kind of what happened
at the end there?

1:21:18.441 --> 1:21:21.075
Yeah, of course. I mean, when
we fought bite force in 2019,

1:21:21.077 --> 1:21:23.944
obviously he has hinged forks
in the front,

1:21:23.946 --> 1:21:26.714
so that was our primary
focus to stay off of those

1:21:26.716 --> 1:21:29.183
or to damage them to
the point where they couldn't
get under us anymore.

1:21:29.185 --> 1:21:30.885
And we were doing pretty
good at the beginning,

1:21:30.887 --> 1:21:33.854
but obviously end game
has got a pretty
terrifying weapon.

1:21:33.856 --> 1:21:37.491
So they were able to get
a few hits on us and flip us,

1:21:37.493 --> 1:21:39.960
obviously changing
the kind of the dynamic

1:21:39.962 --> 1:21:41.028
of the match at that point.

1:21:41.030 --> 1:21:44.265
I did lose drive about halfway
through on one side,

1:21:44.267 --> 1:21:47.134
so that made maneuvering
pretty difficult after that

1:21:47.136 --> 1:21:49.236
and they pretty much
had their way with us,
I think at that point.

1:21:49.238 --> 1:21:52.373
There is no shame in
losing to the champ at all,

1:21:52.375 --> 1:21:55.342
but andrea explain to
the people at home.

1:21:55.344 --> 1:21:57.011
Is it a helpless feeling

1:21:57.013 --> 1:21:59.413
when you're going against
a bot like end game

1:21:59.415 --> 1:22:01.048
and they're kind of having
their way with you

1:22:01.050 --> 1:22:03.117
for a few seconds there?

1:22:03.119 --> 1:22:04.351
I mean, we're here to put
on a show.

1:22:04.353 --> 1:22:05.920
What we don't want
is for our robot

1:22:05.922 --> 1:22:07.321
to get in there
and not work.

1:22:07.323 --> 1:22:09.890
That was spectacular.
I think
it was edge of their seat.

1:22:09.892 --> 1:22:12.526
I mean, it was for me.
I'm sure it was
for everybody else.

1:22:13.362 --> 1:22:16.130
So I'm happy with that fight.

1:22:16.132 --> 1:22:19.900
You still feel good
about where you are in 2021.

1:22:19.902 --> 1:22:22.036
I mean, we're...
We're 1-1 now.

1:22:22.038 --> 1:22:23.971
So it all comes down to
the third fight, card fight.

1:22:23.973 --> 1:22:25.205
That's a lot of pressure.

1:22:25.207 --> 1:22:27.207
I was hoping that it would
turn out a little differently,

1:22:27.209 --> 1:22:29.243
but we'll have the
robot ready to go.

1:22:29.245 --> 1:22:30.844
You're always
a ton of fun to watch.

1:22:30.846 --> 1:22:32.379
Thanks,
andrea and michael gellatly

1:22:32.381 --> 1:22:33.914
-and team witch doctor.
-Thank you.

1:22:33.916 --> 1:22:35.149
Thanks guys.

1:22:41.257 --> 1:22:43.190
you know, kenny, when
they give you one of these

1:22:43.192 --> 1:22:44.925
like end game
earned a season ago,

1:22:44.927 --> 1:22:46.260
everybody is coming after you

1:22:46.262 --> 1:22:49.129
and you know, what's happened
so far, took care of hydra

1:22:49.131 --> 1:22:50.731
and now has taken care
of witch doctor.

1:22:50.733 --> 1:22:52.132
That's pretty impressive.

1:22:52.134 --> 1:22:54.802
Absolutely, considering
the level of
those opponents too,

1:22:54.804 --> 1:22:56.036
very impressive.

1:22:56.038 --> 1:22:58.372
But a couple other bots
have made some noise tonight.

1:22:58.374 --> 1:23:00.841
<i> [chris] we saw shatter!</i>
<i>  Improve to 2-0, with a win</i>

1:23:00.843 --> 1:23:03.110
<i>  over blacksmith on</i>
<i>  a hammer on hammer crime.</i>

1:23:03.112 --> 1:23:05.546
<i>  Uppercut continued</i>
<i>  an explosive trend</i>

1:23:05.548 --> 1:23:08.482
<i>  of taking its anger</i>
<i>  out on fuel tanks,</i>

1:23:08.484 --> 1:23:10.985
<i>  and hydra got off the schneid</i>

1:23:10.987 --> 1:23:14.555
<i>  and knocked one into that</i>
<i>  all important win column.</i>

1:23:16.058 --> 1:23:18.225
So for faruq, the
bot whisperer, pete,

1:23:18.227 --> 1:23:20.394
my man, kenny florian,
I'm chris rose,

1:23:20.396 --> 1:23:23.931
we'll see
you next time on battlebots.
