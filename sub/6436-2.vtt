00:07.008 --> 00:08.999
(theme music playing )

00:39.290 --> 00:41.246
( gasps )

00:41.417 --> 00:43.078
Sura.

00:49.926 --> 00:52.292
When the Romans came

00:54.764 --> 00:56.880
- I thought I'd never see you--
- Shh!

00:58.809 --> 01:00.970
I will always be with you.

01:01.145 --> 01:04.637
The gods themselves
cannot keep me from your side.

01:05.942 --> 01:07.148
I would kill them all for trying.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.056
(moaning)

01:51.153 --> 01:53.144
(screaming )

02:12.133 --> 02:14.749
Have him taken to the baths,

02:14.927 --> 02:16.792
but first attend
to all that fucking hair.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.962
(grunts)

02:22.268 --> 02:24.259
(Spartacus yelling )

02:32.903 --> 02:34.894
(men grunting, yelling)

02:36.198 --> 02:38.029
Dominus.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.187
( Lucretia sighs )

03:18.949 --> 03:22.191
- The pool's dry.
- Yes, we need rain.

03:23.746 --> 03:26.283
Money would also see it filled.

03:26.457 --> 03:28.243
We need that too.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.659
How fares your new pet?

03:31.837 --> 03:33.828
- He breathes.
- His cost was enough

03:34.006 --> 03:35.837
for us to fill the pool for a month.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.624
- You paid beyond the asking.
- I paid his worth, Lucretia.

03:38.803 --> 03:42.261
- Spartacus is a corpse yet walking.
- ( sighs )

03:42.431 --> 03:44.422
How long before
he takes his place in the grave,

03:44.600 --> 03:47.637
- dragging your investment with him?
- Not before he serves his purpose.

03:49.188 --> 03:52.225
From the legatus Claudius Glaber.

03:53.943 --> 03:57.356
- His intentions?
- Nudging towards my desires.

03:58.531 --> 03:59.941
He comes here.

04:00.116 --> 04:01.777
Two days hence.

04:02.785 --> 04:04.491
Well, the reason for his visit is absent.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.277
ln words, but the meaning shines.

04:06.455 --> 04:09.492
- He comes to thank me.
- For what?

04:09.667 --> 04:11.749
For paying too much for the Thracian?

04:11.919 --> 04:15.457
Spartacus defied Glaber's attempt
at assassination in the arena.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.997
The people demanded freedom--

04:18.175 --> 04:20.086
an embarrassment for the legatus.

04:21.429 --> 04:24.717
I offered an alternative
by purchasing him.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.596
At an inflated price.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.473
If Spartacus survives to swear the oath,

04:28.644 --> 04:33.104
the arena will be his tomb
as first intended. If not--

04:33.274 --> 04:36.266
Then his passing becomes
an early delight for the legatus.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.435
( laughs)

04:40.239 --> 04:43.106
- Desires well nudged.
-Mmm.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.983
Ah.

04:46.162 --> 04:48.198
There's yet more stroking needed.

04:50.291 --> 04:53.328
A simple gesture of gratitude
from the legatus falls short.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.918
Patronage is the reward we seek...

04:57.089 --> 04:58.704
( grunts)
nothing less.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.417
The legatus as patron--

05:04.472 --> 05:07.214
His coins will fill our pool to overflowing.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.552
We need to prepare a feast...

05:09.727 --> 05:11.092
A small one.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.556
...with wine

05:13.731 --> 05:15.562
and water-- lots of water.

05:15.733 --> 05:19.066
Just enough to wet the tongue.

05:25.868 --> 05:28.951
l'll sacrifice a bull to appease
the gods in our venture.

05:29.121 --> 05:32.284
Well, perhaps something smaller.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.410
- A ram then.
- To the gods.

05:37.588 --> 05:40.830
May they bless us
with good fortune.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.008
( both moaning )

06:17.419 --> 06:19.956
-( lock clanks)
- ( door opens)

06:20.130 --> 06:22.121
( guards laugh )

06:25.094 --> 06:26.959
( lock clanks )

06:27.972 --> 06:30.213
Crixus:
Well, lick my hole,

06:30.391 --> 06:32.222
the pigfucker's still alive.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.304
Barca:
This is the one,

06:35.479 --> 06:38.562
the Spartacus
everyone's been pissing about.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.314
Spartacus? My name is--

06:41.485 --> 06:44.773
No one gives shit
to who you were, Thracian.

06:44.947 --> 06:48.235
I give no shit to who he is.

06:48.409 --> 06:51.822
- ( gladiators laugh )
- What is this place?

06:51.996 --> 06:54.112
The afterlife, friend,

06:54.290 --> 06:56.952
or at least outside its rusted gates.

06:57.126 --> 07:00.289
You are now
an honored guest of Batiatus,

07:00.462 --> 07:03.795
master of the greatest ludus in Capua!

07:03.966 --> 07:05.581
( men shout)

07:05.759 --> 07:07.545
Ludus?

07:07.720 --> 07:09.301
A school of training,

07:09.471 --> 07:12.178
where men are forged into gods,

07:12.349 --> 07:14.601
blood their ambrosia,

07:14.768 --> 07:17.350
the arena their mountaintop.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.976
Gladiators.

07:22.151 --> 07:23.982
The truest of brotherhoods!

07:24.153 --> 07:26.189
( men shout)

07:26.363 --> 07:28.319
Barca:
Live the next few days,

07:28.490 --> 07:30.401
you and the other recruits

07:30.576 --> 07:32.692
will count yourself among us

07:32.870 --> 07:35.077
and bear our mark.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.989
— ( gladiators laugh )
— In the mean,

07:38.167 --> 07:39.703
can we fetch you something?

07:39.877 --> 07:42.368
Food? Water?

07:42.546 --> 07:45.128
Maybe some scented oils for your feet?

07:46.342 --> 07:48.207
Water.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.717
(gladiators laughing )

07:54.600 --> 07:57.216
Oh, he's slow this one, isn't he?

07:57.394 --> 07:59.305
Barca:
What do you expect from a Thracian?

08:00.356 --> 08:02.938
Smells like fresh shit.

08:04.068 --> 08:07.435
Oh, they all do,
except for their women.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.399
They smell like...

08:09.573 --> 08:12.861
( sniffs )
piss and shit.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.366
What are you then?

08:18.540 --> 08:21.077
I'm a Gaul, little man.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.537
The greatest of my kind--

08:23.712 --> 08:26.089
Crixus the Undefeated!

08:26.256 --> 08:27.962
A Gaul?

08:29.927 --> 08:32.213
That explains why you

08:32.388 --> 08:33.969
smell like a woman.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.473
Oh, you tend to your wounds.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.519
Eat. Rest.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.234
When you gain your strength,

08:52.408 --> 08:54.399
we'll revisit that remark.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.379
( men shouting )

09:36.076 --> 09:39.694
Weak. Weak!

09:41.123 --> 09:44.832
A pile of shit.
Not a cock among them.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.584
Well, then you should
join them, you little cunt.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.900
What is beneath your feet?

10:18.619 --> 10:20.701
Answer!

10:20.871 --> 10:23.578
What is beneath your feet?

10:25.793 --> 10:27.954
Sand.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.368
(gladiators laughing )

10:29.546 --> 10:32.834
Crixus, what is beneath your feet?

10:33.008 --> 10:34.919
Sacred ground, Doctore,

10:35.093 --> 10:37.550
watered with the tears of blood.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.508
Doctore:
Your tears, your blood,

10:40.682 --> 10:43.549
your pathetic lives forged
into something of worth.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.434
Listen, learn

10:46.605 --> 10:49.062
and perhaps live

10:49.233 --> 10:51.474
as gladiators.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.483
Now attend your master.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.993
Batiatus:
You have been blessed,

11:03.163 --> 11:06.075
each and every one of you,

11:06.250 --> 11:08.366
to find yourselves here

11:08.544 --> 11:11.581
at the ludus
of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus,

11:11.755 --> 11:15.168
purveyor of the finest gladiators
in all of the republic!

11:15.342 --> 11:17.583
( men shout)

11:17.761 --> 11:20.218
Batiatus: Prove yourselves
in the hard days to follow.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.721
Prove yourselves more
than a common slave,

11:22.891 --> 11:24.506
more than a man.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.926
Fail and die,

11:27.104 --> 11:29.095
either here where you stand

11:29.273 --> 11:31.389
or sold off to the mines;

11:31.567 --> 11:36.061
Succeed and stand proud
among my titans!

11:36.238 --> 11:39.947
Men:
Batiatus! Batiatus! Batiatus!

11:49.293 --> 11:53.036
A gladiator does not fear death.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.080
He embraces it, caresses it,

11:56.258 --> 11:58.840
-fucksit
-(chucMes)

11:59.928 --> 12:01.884
(coughs)

12:02.055 --> 12:04.512
Each time he enters the arena,

12:04.683 --> 12:09.302
he slips his cock
into the mouth of the beast

12:09.479 --> 12:12.687
and prays to thrust home

12:12.858 --> 12:15.099
before the jaw snaps shut.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.525
None of you stray dogs

12:20.699 --> 12:23.156
would last a fleeting moment...

12:25.954 --> 12:28.195
except one.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.459
This sad, battered Thracian

12:34.630 --> 12:36.791
stood against four in the arena,

12:36.965 --> 12:38.125
condemned to die,

12:38.300 --> 12:41.258
given nothing but a sword
to wager his life upon.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.636
They came at him...

12:48.852 --> 12:51.935
- ( crowd roaring )
- ...again and again and again.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.266
(grunting)

13:00.906 --> 13:04.069
He defied death, fate,

13:04.242 --> 13:06.528
the gods themselves.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.694
(yelling)

13:20.717 --> 13:22.753
Spartacus! Spartacus!

13:22.928 --> 13:24.919
Spartacus!
Spartacus!

13:26.223 --> 13:29.260
Gaze at this man, study him

13:29.434 --> 13:31.140
and realize...

13:32.521 --> 13:35.103
- he is nothing--
- ( gladiators laughing)

13:35.273 --> 13:38.561
--a coward,
a deserter from the auxiliary,

13:38.735 --> 13:41.977
his victory in the arena
as hollow as his courage.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.817
He fought against the ill-trained men

13:44.992 --> 13:47.483
of Solonius, your master's rival.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.698
Had Spartacus entered
the arena with any gladiator here,

13:50.872 --> 13:53.659
his head would've left
well in advance of his body.

13:58.672 --> 14:02.005
Doctore:
The Thracian disagrees.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.086
A demonstration perhaps?

14:07.806 --> 14:10.843
Crixus!
Practice swords.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.227
Prove us wrong, Spartacus.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.079
Pick it up.

14:40.172 --> 14:41.378
Spartacus!

14:48.889 --> 14:52.347
- That is not my name.
- ( growls )

14:59.357 --> 15:02.485
Your name, your life

15:02.652 --> 15:04.358
is what we decide.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.508
Perhaps the coward
requires advantage

15:28.678 --> 15:31.215
to still his trembling knees.

15:32.224 --> 15:33.430
Gladius.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.366
Pick it up!

15:55.247 --> 15:56.703
I can do nothing with this one.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.125
Send him to the mines.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.837
Feeling rested are we?

16:15.642 --> 16:16.677
( Spartacus sighs )

16:22.107 --> 16:24.098
(gladiators laughing )

16:25.694 --> 16:28.356
An attack must be grounded
in proper footing.

16:28.530 --> 16:32.569
He attempts to press
before regaining balance.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.581
- Crixus!
- Crixus!

17:01.646 --> 17:05.230
Allow advantage
to your back and you are dead.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.065
( gladiators laugh )

17:11.239 --> 17:12.740
(Spartacus yells, grunting )

17:18.288 --> 17:20.279
(gladiators shouting )

17:24.586 --> 17:26.668
(grunts)

17:35.430 --> 17:38.547
Become entangled
with a more powerful opponent,

17:38.725 --> 17:41.091
and you are dead.

17:46.191 --> 17:48.307
(yells)

17:57.911 --> 17:59.651
_( body thuds)
- ( gladiators laughing)

18:02.457 --> 18:03.993
Doctore:
Hurl your sword in the arena

18:04.167 --> 18:07.375
and you are dead again.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.392
(grunts)

18:22.435 --> 18:24.721
Your foolishness has cost a life,

18:24.896 --> 18:27.763
but yours may yet be redeemed.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.978
Two fingers, a sign of surrender.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.734
A plea of mercy
to the editor of the games.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.156
Beg for your life, little rabbit.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.491
Bash his skull in.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.998
- Batiatus: Crixus!
- ( wheezing )

18:54.217 --> 18:57.050
- Dominus.
- Continue training.

19:01.016 --> 19:04.383
He tries to kill your best man
and yet you let him live.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.802
Glaber visits tomorrow.

19:06.980 --> 19:10.472
His intention toward
the Thracian may include blood.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.984
Until his patronage is secured,
I intend to keep it warm and flowing.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.441
God, the heat--

19:17.615 --> 19:20.152
enough to boil
the tongue from the head.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.129
(men grunting)

20:10.543 --> 20:12.499
(grunting)

20:21.888 --> 20:23.844
(men grunting)

20:37.445 --> 20:39.436
( sniffs )

20:39.614 --> 20:41.115
Eat it.

21:00.635 --> 21:04.298
Shitfucking slaves and criminals,
the lot of them.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.849
Are we the better?

21:08.017 --> 21:10.429
You survived your own execution,

21:10.603 --> 21:14.471
twice if you mark the Gaul over there
not introducing your brains to the sand.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.059
( laughs)

21:16.234 --> 21:19.101
You are of a difference, Thracian,

21:19.279 --> 21:21.770
above this unfortunate collection.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.028
And you?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.610
Varro.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.361
The worst of the lot--

21:29.539 --> 21:31.905
a free man consigned by his own hand.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.493
Why would a man
willingly condemn himself to this?

21:36.671 --> 21:39.378
A small matter of debt grown large.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.791
The repaying of it proves difficult.

21:43.845 --> 21:46.336
If the concern was only to me--

21:48.016 --> 21:49.552
A family?

21:49.726 --> 21:51.591
Wife and child--

21:52.687 --> 21:54.723
a boy.

21:55.815 --> 21:59.103
Two years in the arena
and my winnings will keep them fed.

21:59.277 --> 22:00.813
Winnings?

22:00.987 --> 22:03.319
Fight well
and you are rewarded with coin,

22:03.490 --> 22:06.197
enough even to balance what I owe,
the gods be fortunate.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.025
The gods?

22:10.538 --> 22:12.324
You are a fool.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.865
And in good company,
by thejudging.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.251
They're the best I could do at the moment.

22:19.422 --> 22:21.162
One or two show promise, but the rest?

22:21.341 --> 22:22.581
My own mother
would have them in the arena.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.171
You have no mother. You were belched
from the cunt of the underworld.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.506
- That's why I favor you.
- Were there no better offerings?

22:27.680 --> 22:30.137
Better? Yes.
Within reach of my purse? No.

22:30.308 --> 22:33.892
You stand questioning and complaining
instead of setting yourself to the task.

22:34.062 --> 22:37.680
| press to honor you, Batiatus,
and this ludus.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.597
Legatus Glaber visits tomorrow,

22:39.776 --> 22:40.982
with him hope of renewed fortunes.

22:41.152 --> 22:44.565
Till then, these men are
all the straw afforded.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.776
Bake them to brick
or crumble them to the mines.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.532
Your will, my hands.

22:54.374 --> 22:57.241
Ovidius, apologies for the delay.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.034
Accepted if made with coin.

23:00.213 --> 23:02.625
- Huh.
- Three months of grain,

23:02.799 --> 23:04.710
the payment standing past due.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.590
- Three is it?
- To the day.

23:09.597 --> 23:13.465
The games of the vulcanalia approach.
If I could carry the debt until them--

23:13.643 --> 23:15.554
Principal plus 30%.

23:15.728 --> 23:19.312
- 30?
- Or settle the debt

23:19.482 --> 23:21.814
- as it stands.
- Batiatus: Huh.

23:21.985 --> 23:25.569
Principal plus 30
after the vulcanalia.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.023
The day after.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.290
(grunts)

23:45.300 --> 23:47.461
lcould've taken him.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.546
Crixus? Pfft!

23:49.721 --> 23:51.632
Shit would be running down your leg.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.092
I wouldn't have ended up in the dirt,
fucked like a dog.

23:54.267 --> 23:57.600
Without training, the Gaul would've
bested any of us, Kerza.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.261
Speaking otherwise is bloated air.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.853
Man:
I pray not to face Crixus in the final test.

24:04.027 --> 24:07.565
Nothing to worry. You'll never
make it that far, cockhole.

24:07.739 --> 24:09.855
All can make it to the test...

24:10.033 --> 24:11.944
and beyond.

24:12.952 --> 24:17.241
- Freedom.
- Varro: One day, if you fight well.

24:17.415 --> 24:20.703
Freedom. lt's piss
without the money to keep it, Varro.

24:20.877 --> 24:22.833
Win the hearts
of the crowd in the arena

24:23.004 --> 24:24.960
and you'll be blessed with both.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.123
You fought the gladiators there.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.884
What do you think of our chances?

24:36.309 --> 24:38.470
- You're all gonna die.
-( keysjingling)

24:42.565 --> 24:43.930
( lock clacks )

24:45.860 --> 24:47.191
Up!

24:48.696 --> 24:51.153
You will sleep
when you prove yourselves men.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.009
- Ah!
- Doctore: Keep pace!

25:23.690 --> 25:25.351
lt's late.

25:26.401 --> 25:27.516
It is.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.272
Return to your dreams.

25:30.446 --> 25:31.561
In a minute.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.359
- We need better wine.
- We need many things.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.369
We'll have them again.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.581
The arrangements are set?

25:44.752 --> 25:46.583
I've taken care of everything.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.494
I cannot fall short tomorrow.

25:48.673 --> 25:52.165
- If I can secure Glaber's patronage--
- You will.

25:53.845 --> 25:55.460
How are you certain?

25:57.974 --> 26:00.932
We've done everything we can.
It's in the hands of the gods now.

26:02.103 --> 26:03.468
Huh.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.313
Come to bed.

26:09.694 --> 26:11.525
And bring that awful wine.

26:13.948 --> 26:16.155
I beg you--

26:16.325 --> 26:18.532
do not fuck me.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.128
(men panting, grunting )

26:48.191 --> 26:50.147
Halt!

26:50.318 --> 26:52.525
The day's training will begin shortly.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.356
Eat.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.145
(men grunt)

26:57.533 --> 26:59.740
Oh, Jupiter's cock!

26:59.911 --> 27:01.401
And now we train all day?

27:05.458 --> 27:07.995
Still believe every man
will live to see the test?

27:11.881 --> 27:13.087
Mostly.

27:14.217 --> 27:15.502
Yet the fool then.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.427
Batiatus paid for these men?

27:20.598 --> 27:22.213
Varro:
Very little by the look of them.

27:23.226 --> 27:27.094
Spartacus:
The Roman way-- lives for coins.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.648
Varro:
Some deserving more than others.

27:29.816 --> 27:33.058
I've heard a certain Thracian
was quite the price.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.857
Spartacus:
I would see the cost rise higher still.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.533
Barca: I recall the hardship
of the march when l was a recruit.

27:50.711 --> 27:53.088
You must be mad with hunger.

27:53.256 --> 27:55.588
Fill your bellies.

27:59.053 --> 28:02.090
(gladiators laughing, shout)

28:09.021 --> 28:10.852
Varro: Shit.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.482
Wake me when it's time to die again.

28:28.791 --> 28:30.782
Apologies for the porridge.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.370
Barca finds the jest amusing.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.456
At least he didn't piss in it this time.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.040
It adds an unpleasant bite.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.457
The days will be hard.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.216
Without food...

28:42.889 --> 28:44.720
- more so.
- You would give me your bread?

28:46.100 --> 28:48.637
Mine? No.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.052
I move things from here to there,

28:51.230 --> 28:53.516
this hand to that,
even from outside these walls.

28:53.691 --> 28:57.559
Whatever your needs,
Ashur provides.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.728
I owe no man.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.612
Ah.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.943
| ask nothing in return.

29:04.118 --> 29:07.861
My only concern is your strength
and well being in the coming day.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.738
Come to plain words.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.287
Simply stated then.

29:15.379 --> 29:18.621
In addition to other services,
I offer odds.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.335
Will this man live? That one die?

29:20.509 --> 29:23.501
How fast? How slow?
On what day or hour?

29:23.679 --> 29:26.671
Games to pass
the time and the coin.

29:26.849 --> 29:28.009
And how am lfixed?

29:28.184 --> 29:29.890
12 to the one favoring the mines;

29:30.061 --> 29:32.473
higher towards your death.

29:33.522 --> 29:36.730
Crixus stands to lose a sum
if you defy the numbering.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.650
I would see it so.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.445
Ah.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.373
Do not think me friend.

29:54.543 --> 29:57.159
( chuckles )
The thought is well removed.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.805
(grunts)

30:15.481 --> 30:17.472
How did you manage this?

30:18.526 --> 30:19.732
- By playing the odds.
- ( door opens )

30:21.529 --> 30:24.020
I fear they're about to worsen.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.114
(grunts)

30:46.804 --> 30:48.795
( lock clanks )

30:57.356 --> 31:00.848
- Glaber.
- You'll address me by title of Legatus.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.608
(grunts)

31:05.990 --> 31:07.480
Yet the animal,

31:07.658 --> 31:10.115
the mark of your kind.

31:10.286 --> 31:12.902
- Where is she?
- Who?

31:15.166 --> 31:16.781
Oh, that little wife of yours.

31:16.959 --> 31:19.371
- Where?!
- Wherever I please!

31:24.425 --> 31:27.041
She has served you no grievance.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.880
No.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.636
None.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.762
Butyoun

31:32.933 --> 31:35.140
you have grieved me

31:35.311 --> 31:38.178
by stirring the auxiliary into desertion,
calling my command into question,

31:38.355 --> 31:40.892
imperiling my standing
with the Senate!

31:41.942 --> 31:43.398
And then in the arena

31:43.569 --> 31:46.777
you grieve me again
by not knowing when to die!

31:46.947 --> 31:48.778
My life then,

31:50.117 --> 31:51.698
in exchange for hers.

31:51.869 --> 31:53.951
But your life is
no longer yours to bargain.

31:56.207 --> 31:58.744
If I wish it ceased,
l have but to whisper

31:58.918 --> 32:02.001
and good Batiatus will command it.

32:02.171 --> 32:04.162
Then tongue the words in his ear.

32:08.344 --> 32:10.300
You mistake me, Thracian.

32:11.430 --> 32:16.174
True, I once sought death
in repayment for your slights.

32:16.352 --> 32:19.469
But I see the error of that now,

32:19.647 --> 32:23.060
wishing for an end-- too quick.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.815
No, my desires have turned to blood,

32:28.989 --> 32:31.025
spilled by the drop over time

32:31.200 --> 32:32.986
until you are drained.

32:34.078 --> 32:35.943
I told you
Rome's shadow was vast

32:36.122 --> 32:38.909
and you would yet die under it,
sliver by sliver,

32:39.083 --> 32:40.994
to the roar of the crowd.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.379
Oh.

32:50.553 --> 32:52.635
A parting kindness

32:53.681 --> 32:55.421
to bind us.

33:01.397 --> 33:04.605
I took it from her thigh

33:04.775 --> 33:07.266
to preserve the scent...

33:07.444 --> 33:08.695
( sniffs )

33:08.863 --> 33:11.650
before my men stained it with their own.

33:11.824 --> 33:14.281
(yells) No!

33:15.369 --> 33:17.951
She was a savage amusement.

33:18.998 --> 33:22.035
And when the fight finally left her eyes,

33:22.209 --> 33:25.997
I sold her to
an unpleasant Syrian for half a coin.

33:32.928 --> 33:36.512
You see? The Thracian finally learns
his place before me--

33:39.435 --> 33:41.016
on his knees.

33:48.068 --> 33:51.231
Your visit with the Thracian
was satisfying then?

33:51.405 --> 33:53.566
The man is of no more concern to me.

33:53.741 --> 33:57.029
Ah, none whatsoever.
We have prepared a feast in your honor.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.945
- I leave for Rome.
- Rome? Now?

34:00.122 --> 34:03.159
Something for your trip then?

34:06.295 --> 34:09.879
You really shouldn't have gone
to the trouble, Lucretia.

34:10.049 --> 34:13.257
These common dishes leave
my stomach unsettled.

34:14.470 --> 34:17.507
Some wine perhaps
while we wait for your husband?

34:17.681 --> 34:21.299
- Sestian?
- No, but something of equal taste.

34:21.477 --> 34:23.342
Water then.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.022
The heat and the dust--

34:29.193 --> 34:31.354
will it ever rain again?

34:31.528 --> 34:33.143
We can only pray.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.358
Can't place foot on street in Capua

34:35.532 --> 34:37.864
without hearing someone pleading
to the heavens for a sprinkle.

34:38.035 --> 34:41.493
And the gods yet ignore us.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.742
Perhaps we've done
something to offend them.

34:46.961 --> 34:50.249
I try to do a little something every day.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.959
So you're the cause, llithyia.

34:53.133 --> 34:55.385
l'd stand a bit away.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.838
Jupiter could hurl a bolt at any moment.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.880
He'd have to choose between targets.

35:02.935 --> 35:07.395
And I thought I was in the presence
of a proper Roman woman.

35:07.564 --> 35:10.101
Proper is a word forged by men

35:10.276 --> 35:12.642
who would seek to enslave us with it.

35:14.196 --> 35:17.063
Doctore:
Kerza, ground yourself!

35:17.241 --> 35:19.232
- ( whip snaps)
- ( men grunting)

35:19.410 --> 35:21.571
( practice swords clacking )

35:45.394 --> 35:47.680
Have you ever been inside a ludus?

35:51.775 --> 35:54.152
but father would never allow it.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.528
- And you obey his commands?
- Not all of them.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.654
Or my husband's.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.362
How do you live
with the noise and the smell,

36:02.536 --> 36:05.323
surrounded by these... animals?

36:06.540 --> 36:08.781
Yes, they are
wild and savage, aren't they?

36:08.959 --> 36:13.419
Something out of a fever dream.
Isn't it a worry?

36:13.589 --> 36:17.707
What if they went insane all at once,
clamoring for blood?

36:17.885 --> 36:20.217
This ludus has been
in my husband's family for generations,

36:20.387 --> 36:21.888
and yet it stands.

36:22.056 --> 36:24.172
And what about your children?

36:24.350 --> 36:25.965
Do you let them play with them?

36:27.019 --> 36:29.635
Mmm. l'm without children.

36:31.899 --> 36:34.185
Oh. Apologies.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.193
- | just thought a woman of your age--
-Mmm.

36:41.075 --> 36:43.908
Come. We leave for Rome.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.410
- So soon?
- Well, can't we stay awhile?

36:47.581 --> 36:50.163
I want to watch the gladiators.

36:50.334 --> 36:52.199
Another time. Come.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.047
Huh.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.758
(sighs)

37:26.662 --> 37:28.198
Kurza.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.740
Pair with Spartacus.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.954
Yes, Doctore.

37:35.129 --> 37:36.915
Doctore:
Recruits, attend!

37:37.923 --> 37:40.505
Show the Thracian what
we've learned in his absence.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.636
Form one. Attack!

37:56.150 --> 37:58.641
( both grunting )

38:07.536 --> 38:09.902
Form two. Attack!

38:34.021 --> 38:36.228
- ( yells)
- ( grunts)

38:38.942 --> 38:40.102
Spartacus!

38:42.863 --> 38:44.649
Spartacus!

38:54.917 --> 38:57.954
( chokes)

39:07.012 --> 39:09.628
(grunts, yelling)

39:33.205 --> 39:35.196
(sighs)

39:35.374 --> 39:37.740
Well, the gods haven't
pissed on me enough for one day?

39:37.918 --> 39:41.877
Legatus fucking Glaber spurns me
like a common slave.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.914
But no, let's add shit to the piss.
Let's pour it into his mouth.

39:45.092 --> 39:48.550
lf word gets out
that Batiatus can't control his own men--

39:48.720 --> 39:51.097
- I warned you of their quality.
- You warned me of nothing.

39:51.265 --> 39:52.926
You counsel
and make promises to the air.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.681
"My hands, your will."

39:56.562 --> 39:59.429
The legatus barely beyond
my fucking gates!

39:59.606 --> 40:02.097
- Doctore: The Thracian is unpredictable.
- Then school him to our standards.

40:02.276 --> 40:05.814
Rod and lash fall unnoticed.
He is an animal best unleashed in the mines.

40:05.988 --> 40:09.196
No. The rest to the gods--
they were of little cost--

40:09.366 --> 40:12.358
but Spartacus is more highly valued,

40:12.536 --> 40:14.868
his worth well exceeding
their entire sum.

40:15.038 --> 40:17.120
I will have return--

40:17.291 --> 40:20.408
if not from the legatus,
then from the man himself.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.201
Even though he is unpredictable?

40:24.089 --> 40:27.377
He is but passionate,
and he stirs the same in others.

40:27.551 --> 40:31.840
A boon to the crowds if we can but divine
the instrument of his taming.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.806
He struggled to retain this bit of fabric

40:36.977 --> 40:39.093
even as the guards beat him.

40:39.271 --> 40:41.353
It may bring you some service.

40:41.523 --> 40:45.436
I noted this in the hand
of the legatus upon his arrival.

40:49.573 --> 40:51.109
( sniffs )

40:54.536 --> 40:56.367
Bring him to my chamber.

40:56.538 --> 40:58.904
I will press to discovery.

41:11.595 --> 41:14.632
Why are you here?
In this place?

41:14.806 --> 41:17.388
Under my hospitality?
Do you know why?

41:17.559 --> 41:20.551
Because I trusted
in the honor of a Roman.

41:20.729 --> 41:24.472
You are here
because of my grandfather.

41:25.609 --> 41:27.645
He built this ludus.

41:27.819 --> 41:31.687
He believed
that no man was without worth,

41:31.865 --> 41:35.483
that even the most vile among us
could rise to honor and glory.

41:35.661 --> 41:38.027
He instilled these beliefs in my father

41:38.205 --> 41:40.196
who in turn passed them on to me.

41:40.374 --> 41:44.663
I am a lanista,
like my forefathers--

41:44.836 --> 41:47.088
a trainer of gladiators.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.545
a small spark, an ember.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.334
I give it breath, tinder,

41:54.513 --> 41:56.720
until it ignites in the arena.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.507
I burn for no cause but my own.

42:00.686 --> 42:02.847
And what might that be? Money?

42:03.021 --> 42:04.727
You've cost me enough on that front.

42:05.774 --> 42:07.890
No, not so base a cause
for this one.

42:10.487 --> 42:12.102
Love?

42:15.200 --> 42:17.612
You have a woman, Thracian?

42:17.786 --> 42:20.949
- l have a wife.
- And do you love her?

42:22.082 --> 42:24.448
Of course you do.
I can see it in the eye,

42:24.626 --> 42:26.127
the tensing of the jaw.

42:26.294 --> 42:29.331
What might be the name
of this delicate flower?

42:31.091 --> 42:33.582
- Sura.
- Where is she?

42:33.760 --> 42:36.843
He took her when he came for me.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.299
Legatus Glaber? He has her?

42:39.474 --> 42:41.886
He sold her to a Syrian.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.846
Well, then how do
you know she still lives?

42:44.020 --> 42:47.558
How do you know
the heart beats beneath your chest?

42:47.733 --> 42:50.019
Most days I don't.

42:50.193 --> 42:52.445
I'm just a simple Roman,

42:52.612 --> 42:55.479
trying to make his way
against the whim of the gods,

42:55.657 --> 42:59.320
the politicians, the miscreants--

42:59.494 --> 43:01.155
though often
you can't tell one from the other.

43:01.329 --> 43:03.035
Butyoun

43:03.206 --> 43:05.913
you are the most dangerous of animals,

43:06.084 --> 43:07.915
a beast born of the heart.

43:08.086 --> 43:11.078
What would you do
to hold your wife again?

43:11.256 --> 43:12.837
To feel the warmth of her skin?

43:13.008 --> 43:15.966
To taste her lips?
Would you kill?

43:17.387 --> 43:19.628
Whoever stood between us.

43:19.806 --> 43:23.139
How many men? 100? 1,000?

43:23.310 --> 43:26.552
- I would kill them all.
- Then do it in the arena.

43:26.730 --> 43:30.314
Fight for me
and the honor of my forefathers.

43:30.484 --> 43:34.443
Prove yourself. Climb to the pinnacle.
Gain your freedom

43:34.613 --> 43:36.478
and that of the woman you've lost.

43:37.699 --> 43:40.406
I did not lose her.

43:40.577 --> 43:43.319
She was taken from me.

43:43.497 --> 43:45.283
A man must accept his fate

43:45.457 --> 43:47.664
or be destroyed by it.

43:49.795 --> 43:53.162
Why would I place my fate

43:53.340 --> 43:55.547
in the hands of another Roman?

43:55.717 --> 43:58.129
Because of what they hold.

44:02.599 --> 44:04.009
Your wife's?

44:08.104 --> 44:11.141
Pass the final test tonight
with honor and servitude,

44:11.316 --> 44:13.648
call me dominus

44:13.819 --> 44:16.060
and lwill help to reunite you.

44:27.958 --> 44:29.744
The choice is yours.

44:35.340 --> 44:37.331
-( both grunting)
- ( men cheering )

45:13.837 --> 45:15.793
Batiatus: Cease!

45:17.257 --> 45:19.339
Varro has stood to a draw.

45:19.509 --> 45:21.170
The test is passed.

45:21.344 --> 45:23.335
( cheering )

45:24.514 --> 45:26.254
( laughs)

45:32.022 --> 45:34.809
Barca. Marcus.

45:34.983 --> 45:36.689
Positions.

45:36.860 --> 45:40.352
( gladiators chanting )
Barca. Barca. Barca.

45:40.530 --> 45:42.441
Barca. Barca.

45:42.616 --> 45:45.028
Barca. Barca. Barca.

45:45.201 --> 45:47.112
Barca. Barca.

45:47.287 --> 45:50.154
Barca. Barca. Barca.

45:55.629 --> 45:57.995
- Doctore: Begin.
- ( yells)

46:04.179 --> 46:06.170
(gladiators laughing )

46:11.311 --> 46:12.767
That's disappointing.

46:12.938 --> 46:14.769
Not every venture ends in climax.

46:14.940 --> 46:17.397
A fact known well to every woman.

46:19.694 --> 46:21.195
(silence)

46:29.913 --> 46:31.619
Crixus.

46:32.832 --> 46:34.697
Spartacus.

46:34.876 --> 46:36.241
Positions.

46:44.469 --> 46:47.427
( gladiators chanting )
Crixus. Crixus. Crixus.

46:47.597 --> 46:49.713
Crixus. Crixus.

46:49.891 --> 46:52.849
Crixus. Crixus. Crixus.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.759
Crixus. Crixus.

46:54.938 --> 46:57.930
Crixus. Crixus. Crixus.

46:58.108 --> 47:01.100
Crixus.
Crixus. Crixus.

47:14.332 --> 47:18.245
One final lesson
before I send you to the afterlife.

47:29.389 --> 47:32.426
- Begin.
- ( exhales sharply )

47:42.569 --> 47:43.900
Fuck.

47:44.070 --> 47:46.812
Expensive and worthless,
all in a measure.

47:46.990 --> 47:50.198
- ( sighs )
- Fight, you Thracian bitch.

47:59.919 --> 48:02.251
Tears?

48:05.508 --> 48:08.625
- The rabbit is fixed to piss himself.
- ( gladiators laughing)

48:12.807 --> 48:14.672
( Crixus yells )

48:29.574 --> 48:32.987
Skin the rabbit!
( laughs )

48:34.454 --> 48:36.194
(yells)

48:44.547 --> 48:46.333
- ( gladiators cheering )
- ( chokes )

48:46.508 --> 48:49.545
(grunts)

48:50.595 --> 48:52.506
Finish him!

48:55.391 --> 48:56.927
Th racians.

49:03.733 --> 49:06.440
- ( yells)
- ( grunts)

49:18.123 --> 49:20.114
( panting )

49:26.339 --> 49:28.921
The lesson is well learned.

49:29.092 --> 49:30.878
Batiatus:
Spartacus!

49:33.680 --> 49:35.341
Cease!

49:41.271 --> 49:44.229
You have passed the test.

49:54.742 --> 49:56.607
Dominus.

49:59.038 --> 50:01.245
Batiatus:
Your life now promises meaning.

50:01.416 --> 50:04.078
Swear it to me.

50:04.252 --> 50:06.834
Recite the sacramentum gladiatorum.

50:08.965 --> 50:11.422
Spartacus:
I commit my flesh,

50:11.593 --> 50:14.335
my mind, my will

50:15.680 --> 50:17.796
- to the glory of this ludus...
-Mmm.

50:17.974 --> 50:21.216
...and the commands
of my master, Batiatus.

50:24.272 --> 50:27.514
I swear to be burned, chained,

50:27.692 --> 50:31.651
beaten or die by the sword

50:32.739 --> 50:35.230
in pursuit of honor in the arena.

50:47.670 --> 50:49.706
Welcome to the brotherhood.

50:57.639 --> 50:59.630
(theme music playing )
