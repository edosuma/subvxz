WEBVTT

00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:07.000 --> 00:09.959
WHAT,
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME NOW?
YOU WOULDN'T CALL ME BACK.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.959
YOU DIDN'T CALL ME AT ALL.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE...
FOR NOW.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.375
WORKING FOR CHARLOTTE...
FOR NOW.

00:15.417 --> 00:18.208
AND SLEEPING WITH
MY BEST FRIEND AGAIN.
YOU REALLY SHOULD KNOCK BEFORE
YOU WALK INTO A DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.041
IT WAS FUNNY.

00:20.083 --> 00:23.000
TWICE I COME TO TOWN,
TWICE YOU WALK IN ON ME.
I HAVE A PATIENT.

00:23.041 --> 00:24.542
I KNOW. JANE WILLIAMS--

00:24.583 --> 00:26.208
30 YEARS OLD,
33 WEEKS PREGNANT.

00:26.250 --> 00:28.667
AMBULANCE JUST BROUGHT HER IN.
SHE'S HAVING A STROKE.
WHAT, HOW--

00:28.709 --> 00:31.208
GOOD, YOU'RE BOTH HERE.
YOU'VE MET MY NEW NEUROLOGIST.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.959
YOUR PATIENT HAS
NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEMS.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.458
I CALLED HIM IN.
OKAY, UH, TIM, CAN YOU
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.375
SHE WAS EATING BREAKFAST,
AND WE WERE ARGUING.

00:37.417 --> 00:40.041
SUDDENLY HER ORANGE JUICE DROPS.
IT JUST FALLS OUT OF HER HAND,

00:40.083 --> 00:42.959
AND THERE'S
ORANGE JUICE EVERYWHERE,

00:43.000 --> 00:44.625
AND JANE CAN'T SPEAK.
THE BABY'S HEARTBEAT IS NORMAL.

00:44.667 --> 00:47.375
JANE, I'M DR. MONTGOMERY. CAN
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

00:47.417 --> 00:49.834
ARE YOU IN ANY PAIN?
(mutters)

00:49.875 --> 00:52.250
JANE, IT'S OKAY. IF YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING,

00:52.291 --> 00:54.667
NOD YOUR HEAD.
GOOD. JUST TRY TO RELAX.

00:54.709 --> 00:56.834
WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.
WHEN DID THIS ALL HAPPEN--

00:56.875 --> 00:59.667
THE ORANGE JUICE
AND THE NOT TALKING?
I-I DON'T KNOW.
A-AN HOUR AGO, MAYBE LONGER.

00:59.709 --> 01:01.458
I NEED YOU TO BE AS EXACT
AS POSSIBLE. IT'S IMPORTANT.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.041
UH, AN HO--AN HOUR
AND 20 MINUTES AGO.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.041
GOOD. GOOD.
THEN WE STILL HAVE TIME.

01:06.083 --> 01:08.458
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A STROKE.
SHE'S HAVING ONE RIGHT NOW.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.250
AND IF I CAN STOP IT IN
THE NEXT HOUR AND 40 MINUTES,

01:11.291 --> 01:12.834
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE

01:12.875 --> 01:15.583
THAT I CAN PREVENT
ANY PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE.

01:15.625 --> 01:18.041
AND WHAT ABOUT THE BABY?

01:18.083 --> 01:27.041
IF YOU TREAT JANE, WHAT--
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BABY?

01:27.083 --> 01:30.083
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

01:34.500 --> 01:36.458
DID THE FIGHT
CAUSE THIS?

01:36.500 --> 01:39.041
STROKES CAN JUST HAPPEN,
OFTEN WITHOUT WARNING.

01:39.083 --> 01:42.250
THERE ARE NO PREDICTORS.

01:42.291 --> 01:43.709
YOU TWO...

01:43.750 --> 01:45.250
THE DIVORCE HAS BEEN UGLY.

01:45.291 --> 01:48.250
SHE HATES THAT THIS BABY
KEEPS ME IN HER LIFE.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.208
THAT WAS THE LAST THING
SHE SAID

01:50.250 --> 01:52.041
RIGHT BEFORE SHE...

01:52.083 --> 01:55.083
SHE WISHED
THAT SHE WASN'T PREGNANT

01:55.125 --> 01:57.750
SO SHE'D NEVER HAVE TO
SEE ME AGAIN.

01:57.792 --> 02:00.667
GOOD NEWS.
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF A BLEED,

02:00.709 --> 02:03.125
WHICH MEANS I CAN PERFORM
AN ENDOVASCULAR CLOT EVACUATION.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.709
EXCUSE ME
JUST A MINUTE.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.250
I DON'T WANT YOU FISHING AROUND
INSIDE HER BRAIN.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.709
YOU SHOULD USE T.P.A.
TO BUST THE CLOTS.
IT'S CONTRAINDICATED
IN PREGNANCY.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.583
NO, IT'S NOT,
NOT IN THE STUDIES I'VE READ,

02:11.625 --> 02:14.250
AND I'M THE OB-GYN.
OH, I KNOW.
DOUBLE BOARD CERTIFIED.

02:14.291 --> 02:17.166
STOP. ARCHIE.
ARCHIE?
I GUESS YOU ARE MAD.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.792
T.P.A.
IS ROLLING THE DICE.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.500
THE PROCEDURE IS SOMETHING
I CAN CONTROL.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.250
AND IF JANE'S LIFE WERE AT RISK,
IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.875
BUT THE STROKE ISN'T GONNA
KILL HER OR THE BABY,

02:26.917 --> 02:29.917
AND WHAT
YOU'RE PROPOSING COULD.
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ABOUT
HER QUALITY OF LIFE?

02:29.959 --> 02:32.291
THE BABY IS 33 WEEKS. ITS
LUNGS AREN'T FULLY DEVELOPED.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.792
IT NEEDS MORE TIME.
T.P.A. OFFERS THAT.
I'M A GOOD NEUROLOGIST, ADDIE.

02:34.834 --> 02:37.208
SOME MIGHT SAY I'M A GREAT ONE.
YOU USED TO SAY IT.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.959
WE HAVE A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR
TO STOP THIS STROKE,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.417
AND I AM TELLING YOU
THAT WE CAN SAVE BOTH OF THEM.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.041
YOU GOT IT?

02:44.083 --> 02:46.041
YEAH--ONE STICKY BUN
FROM DAMN THOSE DONUTS,

02:46.083 --> 02:48.041
ONE BAGEL WITH ONIONS
FROM CANTER'S,

02:48.083 --> 02:50.417
A FRUIT BOWL
AND A MARASCHINO FRAPPé

02:50.458 --> 02:52.041
FROM THE JUICE COLLECTIVE.

02:52.083 --> 02:53.417
WHERE'S MY COFFEE?

02:53.458 --> 02:55.041
YOU CAN'T HAVE COFFEE,
VIOLET.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.417
I'M NOT GIVING UP COFFEE.
MARASCHINO?

02:57.458 --> 02:59.417
THEY WERE
OUT OF POMEGRANATE.

02:59.458 --> 03:02.417
OH, MY GOD.
(mouth full) DID YOU GET TWO?

03:02.458 --> 03:05.375
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S FOR CHARLOTTE.

03:05.417 --> 03:07.583
OH, UH, AN APPLE FRITTER

03:07.625 --> 03:10.041
MAKES UP FOR YOU REFUSING
HER MARRIAGE PROPOSAL?

03:10.083 --> 03:12.583
(chuckles)
I DIDN'T TURN HER DOWN.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.041
I DELAYED ON YOUR ADVICE.
AND SPEAKING OF ADVICE, UM,

03:15.083 --> 03:17.458
PREGNANCY CRAVINGS ARE NOT
A LICENSE TO EAT POORLY.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.333
IT'S NOT A PREGNANCY CRAVING.
I'M JUST HUNGRY.

03:20.375 --> 03:23.041
MM. PAGE 156--
READ ALL ABOUT CRAVINGS,

03:23.083 --> 03:26.041
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
IS WHAT YOU ARE HAVING.
(normal voice) PAGE 336--

03:26.083 --> 03:28.041
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PREGNANT
SHOULD BUTT OUT,

03:28.083 --> 03:31.041
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
MEANS YOU.
YOU KNOW,
I COULDN'T FIND THE PAGE

03:31.083 --> 03:32.792
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR,

03:32.834 --> 03:35.667
WHICH IS THE ONE THAT SAYS
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU

03:35.709 --> 03:38.667
TO TELL THE FATHER
THAT YOU ARE PREGNANT.
I DON'T KNOW IF
EITHER ONE OF THEM WANTS KIDS.

03:38.709 --> 03:41.041
I-I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT KIDS.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.917
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME
YOU FOUND OUT?

03:43.959 --> 03:45.917
YOU HAVE TO TELL SOMEONE,
VIOLET.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.000
I DID. I TOLD YOU.

03:51.083 --> 03:54.041
(Sam) EVERYTHING OKAY?

03:54.083 --> 03:55.583
UH, YEAH. YEAH.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.041
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.792
NO. NO. NO, NO, NO.

03:58.834 --> 04:01.041
(laughs) WHAT'S--
WHAT'S WRONG?

04:01.083 --> 04:04.500
I DON'T THINK I CAN TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THIS.
WHAT, NAI? YOU CAN TALK
TO ME ANYTHING. WHAT?

04:04.542 --> 04:06.667
IT--IT INVOLVES
ANOTHER MAN.

04:06.709 --> 04:09.375
MM. OH.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.667
(exhales deeply)
SHOOT.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.500
OKAY. UM...

04:13.542 --> 04:17.417
ADDISON CAUGHT ME AND ARCHER
HAVING SEX IN HIS NEW OFFICE,

04:17.458 --> 04:21.083
WHICH IS ON THE FOURTH FLOOR
OF PACIFIC WELLCARE.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.542
(breath hitches)

04:22.583 --> 04:24.125
SAM, ARE YOU...

04:24.166 --> 04:26.792
(inhales deeply)

04:28.333 --> 04:31.041
OH, OKAY. OKAY.

04:31.083 --> 04:34.041
OKAY, SO YOU NEED TO--
YOU NEED TO GIVE ME ADVICE.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.709
RIGHT, RIGHT. OKAY.

04:35.750 --> 04:38.041
SO, UH, ARE YOU WORRIED

04:38.083 --> 04:40.083
ABOUT ADDISON FINDING OUT

04:40.125 --> 04:42.625
THAT YOU ARE SLEEPING
WITH HER BROTHER,

04:42.667 --> 04:45.083
OR ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
EVERYBODY FINDING OUT

04:45.125 --> 04:48.667
THAT YOU KEPT ARCHER GETTING
A JOB DOWNSTAIRS A SECRET?

04:48.709 --> 04:50.333
OH, G--UH, BOTH.

04:50.375 --> 04:52.041
BUT, UM, REALLY, I'M WORRIED

04:52.083 --> 04:55.125
THAT SHE'S GONNA GUILT HIM INTO
NOT HAVING SEX WITH ME AGAIN,

04:55.166 --> 04:57.083
BECAUSE THE SEX
IS REALLY GOOD.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.083
S-SAM?
YEAH.

04:59.125 --> 05:01.792
ARE YOU OKAY?
NO, NO, I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
SO I'M GOOD.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.917
YEAH. HOW'S IT GOING
WITH SONYA?
OH, WOW. REALLY, REALLY...
IT'S INCREDIBLY...

05:04.959 --> 05:07.041
SHE'S...
SHE'S MAKING ME WAIT.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.041
AW.
WE--WE--WE'RE WAITING...

05:09.083 --> 05:10.959
OH. (chuckles)
UNTIL SHE'S READY.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.250
BUT--BUT SHE'S READY NOW,
SO...
OH, YEAH.

05:14.291 --> 05:16.542
YEAH.
TAKE YOUR INHALER.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.667
N-NAI, I'M NOT A VIRGIN
ANYMORE.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.417
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.458
ALL RIGHT.

05:25.083 --> 05:28.375
I NEVER THOUGHT
WE'D GET HERE.

05:28.417 --> 05:30.417
WE'RE FRIENDS.

05:30.458 --> 05:33.041
YEAH, WE GOT HERE.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.417
FRIENDS.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.583
YEAH.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.166
(elevator bell dings)

05:42.208 --> 05:43.166
(cough)

05:43.208 --> 05:45.166
UH, HI.
CAN I HELP YOU?

05:45.208 --> 05:47.291
YEAH. IS DR. WILDER IN?
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

05:47.333 --> 05:50.041
UH, NO. HE'S ACTUALLY
RUNNING A LITTLE BIT LATE.
MM.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.750
YOU OKAY?
YEAH. (laughs)

05:51.792 --> 05:53.792
WOW. I MUST LOOK
PRETTY CRAPPY, HUH?

05:53.834 --> 05:55.792
NO, I JUST, UH, I HAD
A ROUGH MORNING, YOU KNOW?

05:55.834 --> 05:59.583
ONE OF THOSE MORNINGS. BUT IS
PETE GONNA--GONNA BE HERE SOON?

05:59.625 --> 06:01.750
WHY DON'T I JUST SHOW YOU
BACK TO HIS OFFICE?

06:01.792 --> 06:03.750
HE SHOULD BE HERE ANY SECOND.
OH, GREAT.

06:03.792 --> 06:07.041
WHEN I GOT THE CALL ABOUT
TERRI'S ACCIDENT...

06:07.083 --> 06:09.625
I WAS SO STUNNED.

06:09.667 --> 06:12.667
SHE WAS SO... SO EXCITED

06:12.709 --> 06:15.667
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT
SHE WAS PREGNANT.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.583
SHE AND MARK, UH, DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS EVER GOING TO HAPPEN,

06:18.625 --> 06:20.583
BUT, UH,
YOU MADE THEM BELIEVE.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.583
I'M SO, SO SORRY
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.750
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...
ONE STUPID GUY...

06:24.792 --> 06:26.792
DRINKS AND DRIVES,

06:26.834 --> 06:30.041
AND...
MY WHOLE FAMILY'S GONE.

06:30.083 --> 06:33.250
I CAME HERE TODAY

06:33.291 --> 06:36.375
BECAUSE TERRI AND MARK DIED
WITHOUT A WILL.

06:36.417 --> 06:40.041
THE EXTRA EMBRYOS
THEY HAD LEFTOVER,

06:40.083 --> 06:42.417
UM, THE ONES
YOU HAVE FROZEN?
YEAH.

06:42.458 --> 06:45.041
THEY'VE BEEN LEFT TO ME.

06:45.083 --> 06:47.417
OH, WERE YOU INTERESTED
IN DONATING THEM?

06:47.458 --> 06:51.000
NO, NO.
I, UM, I'D LIKE THEM.

06:51.041 --> 06:53.458
FOR MYSELF.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.500
I WANT TO HAVE A BABY...

06:55.542 --> 06:57.917
MY DAUGHTER'S BABY.

07:01.083 --> 07:03.375
HEY, KEITH. DELL SAID THAT...

07:07.000 --> 07:12.500
DELL, GET ME A 2 MIGS OF NARCAN
AND CALL AN AMBULANCE.

07:12.542 --> 07:14.625
KEITH.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.041
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

07:16.083 --> 07:18.083
KEITH, HEY. HEY, KEITH!

07:18.125 --> 07:20.041
I-I CALLED 9-1-1.
HERE. HERE.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.667
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

07:25.709 --> 07:27.417
KEITH. DAMN IT!

07:27.458 --> 07:28.834
KEITH!

07:32.125 --> 07:33.542
(Sam) HOW LONG
HAS HE BEEN USING?

07:33.583 --> 07:36.000
HE CAME TO ME A FEW YEARS AGO
FOR HELP WITH STRESS.

07:36.041 --> 07:38.583
HE'S A REAL ESTATE AGENT.
HE LIVES AND DIES BY THE MARKET.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.333
LAST YEAR, THE MARKET CRASHED.
ADDICTION TOOK OVER.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.583
THE GUY'S A TOTAL MESS.
HE LOST HIS JOB, HIS WIFE.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.542
HE'S GOT HEP-C.
TRIFECTA.

07:44.583 --> 07:47.000
I'VE BEEN TREATING HIM FOR FREE,
BUT I THINK THE REAL REASON

07:47.041 --> 07:50.041
HE COMES IS BECAUSE
I GIVE HIM CLEAN NEEDLES.
YOU STARTED
A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM?

07:50.083 --> 07:53.375
SAM, I KNOW THIS GUY. HE
SHOULD NOT DIE IN THE STREETS.

07:53.417 --> 07:56.375
RIGHT NOW, THIS IS
THE ONLY WAY I CAN HELP HIM.
(Keith coughs)

07:56.417 --> 07:58.291
WHAT THE...

07:58.333 --> 08:01.458
HOW DID I...
I FOUND YOU ON THE FLOOR.
YOU O.D.'d.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.041
OH, I FEEL LIKE CRAP.
I KNOW YOU FEEL BAD, BUT WE
GOT YOU BREATHING AGAIN.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.000
WE GOT AN AMBULANCE COMING.

08:06.041 --> 08:08.500
MY HEAD. IT HURTS.
EASY. JUST RELAX.
WHY DON'T YOU LAY BACK DOWN?

08:08.542 --> 08:10.041
NO!

08:10.083 --> 08:12.041
WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING
TO KILL ME?

08:12.083 --> 08:14.709
NOBODY IS TRYING
TO HURT YOU, KEITH.

08:14.750 --> 08:18.000
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO HELP.
NO!

08:21.417 --> 08:24.000
YOU ALL RIGHT?

08:24.041 --> 08:26.750
THEY SEEM LIKE
A NICE COUPLE.

08:26.792 --> 08:29.291
THEY'RE DIVORCED
AND THEY BARELY SPEAK.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.750
WELL, I GUESS THEY SPOKE
LONG ENOUGH TO CONCEIVE.

08:31.792 --> 08:33.917
SPEAKING OF NOT SPEAKING,

08:33.959 --> 08:36.625
ARE WE REALLY GONNA HAVE
A FIGHT ABOUT NAOMI AGAIN?
YOU THINK I'M MAD
ABOUT NAOMI?

08:36.667 --> 08:38.792
OH, GOOD. YOU'RE NOT MAD.
THIS IS YOU NOT MAD.
(scoffs)

08:38.834 --> 08:40.792
LIKE THE TIME I LOANED
YOUR CASHMERE SWEATER

08:40.834 --> 08:42.834
TO CRYSTAL McCULLOGH.
SHE PUKED ON IT.

08:42.875 --> 08:45.166
SHE PUKED UP STRAWBERRY DAIQUIRI
ALL OVER MY SWEATER.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.625
BUT YOU WEREN'T MAD.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.625
I-I WASN'T MAD
THAT YOU LOANED IT.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.625
I WAS MAD THAT YOU LIED.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.625
AND I'M NOT MAD ABOUT NAOMI.
I'M MAD THAT YOU TOOK A JOB

08:53.667 --> 08:56.041
WITH A PRACTICE
THAT IS TRYING TO BURY ME.

08:56.083 --> 08:59.041
YOU KNEW ABOUT IT, AND YOU
DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS TO TELL ME.
WYATT LEFT,

08:59.083 --> 09:01.041
CHASING SOME RIDICULOUS AMOUNT
OF PHARMACEUTICAL CASH.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.041
SO CHARLOTTE NEEDED A BIG NAME.
WHO BETTER BUT ME?

09:04.083 --> 09:06.458
WHY ARE YOU HERE, ARCHER?

09:06.500 --> 09:09.000
THERE WERE
SOME THINGS IN NEW YORK

09:09.041 --> 09:12.000
I WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM.
LIKE? STALKER EX-GIRLFRIEND?

09:12.041 --> 09:14.000
PUBLISHER WHO KNEW
WHERE YOU LIVED?

09:14.041 --> 09:17.417
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.
AFTER THE WAY WE LEFT THINGS,
I WANTED TO TRY AGAIN,

09:17.458 --> 09:18.875
MAKE IT BETTER.

09:18.917 --> 09:20.417
LOOK, LET'S DO THIS CASE.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.417
SEE HOW MUCH YOU ENJOY
WORKING WITH ME.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.667
AS LONG AS WE DO IT
YOUR WAY?
WELL, THAT WOULD HELP.

09:24.709 --> 09:26.667
IT'S THE RIGHT WAY, ADDIE.
(sighs)

09:26.709 --> 09:28.208
I'M JUST CONCERNED.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.208
LOOK, I KNOW
I'M A 52-YEAR-OLD LITIGATOR

09:30.250 --> 09:32.208
AND NOT A 19-YEAR-OLD
CHEERLEADER,

09:32.250 --> 09:35.583
BUT, UM, MY GYNECOLOGIST
STARTED ME ON HORMONE THERAPY,

09:35.625 --> 09:37.583
AND HE THINKS I'M READY
FOR IMPLANTATION.

09:37.625 --> 09:39.583
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT JUST AGE.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.458
THE STRESS
OF LOSING YOUR DAUGHTER,

09:41.500 --> 09:43.458
THAT TAKES ITS PHYSICAL TOLL.

09:43.500 --> 09:47.041
AND IT DOESN'T EXACTLY MAKE YOU
AN IDEAL CANDIDATE FOR I.V.F.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.458
TERRI WANTED TO BRING
A BABY INTO THIS WORLD,

09:49.500 --> 09:52.041
MORE THAN ANYTHING,
AND I CAN DO THAT.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.041
I CAN BRING HER BABY
INTO THE WORLD.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.250
WELL, YOUR GYNECOLOGIST
WAS RIGHT.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.417
YOU ARE CERTAINLY READY.

09:58.458 --> 10:01.417
BUT HAVING YOUR OWN GRANDCHILD?
YOU'RE STILL GRIEVING, SHARON.

10:01.458 --> 10:04.041
THIS ISN'T ABOUT GRIEF.

10:04.083 --> 10:06.291
THIS IS ABOUT
HONORING MY DAUGHTER.

10:10.542 --> 10:13.333
I'VE NEVER SEEN KEITH
THAT BAD.
YEAH, WELL, AT SOME POINT,
YOU'RE JUST GONNA

10:13.375 --> 10:16.041
HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE
AND LET THEM HANDLE IT.
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT ADDICTS, DELL, BUT--

10:16.083 --> 10:17.625
I'M NOT BEING PUNITIVE, OKAY?

10:17.667 --> 10:20.000
I'M NOT MAD. IT'S JUST OBVIOUS
THAT THE GUY NEEDS HELP,

10:20.041 --> 10:22.458
AND YOU TRIED, AND IT'S NOT
WORKING, AND AT LEAST IN JAIL,

10:22.500 --> 10:24.709
HE'LL HAVE TO GO COLD TURKEY.
JAIL ISN'T
THE ANSWER FOR HIM.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.083
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK DELL'S RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.542
KEITH NEEDS TO BE IN A PROGRAM.
I'VE TALKED TO HIM

10:29.583 --> 10:32.083
ABOUT IT BEFORE.
I KNOW HE HAS IT IN HIM

10:32.125 --> 10:35.083
TO GET CLEAN
WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HELP.
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN
GET THROUGH TO THIS GUY?

10:35.125 --> 10:37.083
I THINK I SHOULD TRY.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.000
(mutters)

10:40.834 --> 10:43.291
(mutters)
JANE, I KNOW THAT YOU WANT
TO TALK TO US,

10:43.333 --> 10:45.792
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SCARED,
BUT ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE,

10:45.834 --> 10:48.250
ALL THIS EQUIPMENT,
IS TO HELP YOU GET BETTER.

10:48.291 --> 10:50.917
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME SEDATIVE,

10:50.959 --> 10:53.500
ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU COMFORTABLE,
BUT I NEED FOR YOU TO BE AWAKE

10:53.542 --> 10:55.750
SO THAT WE CAN TEST THINGS
AS WE GO, OKAY?

10:55.792 --> 10:59.208
I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME.
MY SISTER TRUSTS ME. SO CAN YOU.

10:59.250 --> 11:00.875
YOUR BABY IS DOING GREAT.

11:00.917 --> 11:02.625
STAY WITH ME, JANE, OKAY?

11:02.667 --> 11:05.000
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
THROUGH THIS.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.333
BROUGHT YOU
A PEACE OFFERING.

11:11.375 --> 11:12.959
YOUR FAVORITE--FRITTERS,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.250
WARM APPLE, DEEP FRIED
FOR YOUR SOUTHERN TASTE BUDS.

11:18.625 --> 11:21.041
WE HAVE BREAKFAST HERE,
COOPER.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.583
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN SKIP
BREAKFAST HERE, AND WE...

11:23.625 --> 11:25.667
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE ANGRY,

11:25.709 --> 11:28.125
BUT YOU CAN'T
NOT TALK TO ME.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.041
I'M SORRY I SAID NO
ABOUT THE MARRIAGE,

11:30.083 --> 11:31.542
BUT I DID TELL YOU

11:31.583 --> 11:34.041
I WANTED TO SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

11:34.083 --> 11:37.125
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT I DID WRONG
THAT'S SO UNFORGIVABLE?

11:37.166 --> 11:39.959
IF YOU REALLY DON'T GET IT,
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.959
WELL, WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.375
NO, WE DON'T.
AND WE WON'T.

11:44.417 --> 11:46.375
SO SAVE THE REST OF YOUR
EARNEST LITTLE

11:46.417 --> 11:50.667
"I CAN MAKE IT ALL BETTER" ACT,
AND LEAVE, OKAY?

11:58.875 --> 12:00.542
IT'S GOOD, ISN'T IT?

12:00.583 --> 12:03.000
SEE, THIS IS FORTUITOUS,
FINDING YOU HERE.

12:03.041 --> 12:05.709
WE NEED TO TALK,
AND YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING.

12:05.750 --> 12:08.291
AVOIDANCE ISN'T GOOD
FOR ANYONE, VIOLET.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.709
I'M NOT AVOIDING YOU, SHELDON.
I'VE JUST BEEN VERY BUSY.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.667
AND, UM, I-I HAVE
A PATIENT WAITING, SO...

12:12.709 --> 12:14.917
HEY, HEY, COOPER.
YOU GOING BACK UP?

12:14.959 --> 12:17.709
OH, GOOD. YOU GUYS ARE TALKING.
AT LEAST SOMEONE'S TALKING.
IN FACT, WE'RE NOT TALKING.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.375
WE'RE TALKING, SHELDON.
I-I LOVE TALKING TO YOU.

12:20.417 --> 12:23.917
I-I LOVE SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU. I'M JUST--
BUSY. I KNOW.

12:23.959 --> 12:26.417
(children laughing)

12:26.458 --> 12:29.500
CUTE KIDS.
OVER THERE, SHELDON.

12:29.542 --> 12:31.625
AHH, DON'T YOU THINK?

12:31.667 --> 12:34.917
I GUESS, IN SMALL DOSES.
I'M NOT REALLY A KID PERSON.

12:34.959 --> 12:38.041
THEY DON'T SEEM TO LIKE ME.
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
KIDS OF YOUR OWN?

12:38.083 --> 12:40.625
NO. GOD, NO, THANKFULLY.
WELL, YOU MUST SEE THEM
IN YOUR PRACTICE.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.542
I BET YOU'RE GREAT WITH 'EM.

12:42.583 --> 12:46.458
YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND? I'M OKAY
WITH KIDS IN SHORT BURSTS.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.500
BEYOND THAT...

12:48.542 --> 12:50.500
WELL, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM,
IS IT?

12:53.917 --> 12:56.041
ARE YOU MISERABLE
OR STARVING?

12:56.083 --> 12:58.417
BOTH.
ANYTHING YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

12:58.458 --> 13:00.709
THIS IS DOING THE TRICK.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.625
TERRI HUGHES' MOTHER
CAME IN TODAY.

13:02.667 --> 13:03.959
WHY?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.291
WE HAVE TERRI AND MARK'S
EMBRYOS IN OUR FREEZER.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.542
AND SHE WANTS THEM
IMPLANTED... IN HER.

13:09.583 --> 13:11.542
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.375
I DO. SAY NO.
WELL, I KNOW
THERE ARE ISSUES

13:14.417 --> 13:16.875
WITH HER CARRYING
HER OWN GRANDCHILD AND HER AGE,

13:16.917 --> 13:19.667
BUT SHARON SEEMS TO THINK
THAT SHE CAN--
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN SHARON'S REASONS.

13:19.709 --> 13:22.667
TERRI WAS MY PATIENT. I'M
INTERESTED IN WHAT SHE'D THINK.

13:22.709 --> 13:26.041
AND SHE WOULD NEVER,
EVER WANT THIS.
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

13:26.083 --> 13:28.041
TERRI HATED HER MOTHER.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.041
GIVING THAT WOMAN
ANOTHER CHILD--

13:30.083 --> 13:31.792
TERRI'S CHILD--

13:31.834 --> 13:33.583
WOULD'VE BEEN
HER WORST NIGHTMARE.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.375
(Archer) OKAY.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.375
I'M TWISTING THE COIL,
CAPTURING THE CLOT.

13:48.417 --> 13:50.583
A FEW MORE MINUTES, I'LL BE
ABLE TO PULL IT OUTTA THERE,

13:50.625 --> 13:53.041
RETURNING THE BLOOD FLOW
IN YOUR BRAIN BACK TO NORMAL.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.041
(Jane groans)
CAN YOU KEEP HER STILL,
PLEASE?

13:55.083 --> 13:56.792
SHE'S HAVING
UTERINE CONTRACTIONS.

13:56.834 --> 13:59.041
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO STOP THAT.
I WILL. DRAW UP TERBUTALINE.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.625
QUICKLY, PLEASE.
YOU JUST FOCUS
SO YOU DON'T NICK A VESSEL.

14:00.667 --> 14:03.083
JANE, I KNOW
YOU'RE IN A LOT OF PAIN,

14:03.125 --> 14:06.083
BUT I NEED YOU TO STAY
AS STILL AS POSSIBLE.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

14:06.125 --> 14:08.083
JUST GIVE IT A MINUTE.
HEART RATE'S UP. 120. 140.

14:08.125 --> 14:11.041
ADDISON.
IT'S A SIDE EFFECT
FROM THE TERBUTALINE.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.125
JUST A FEW MORE SECONDS.
STAY WITH US, JANE. OKAY?

14:13.166 --> 14:15.458
CONTRACTIONS ARE SLOWING.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.208
OKAY, CAPTURED THE CLOT.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.625
REMOVING THE COIL...

14:20.667 --> 14:23.041
AND INJECTING THE DYE.

14:23.083 --> 14:27.250
OH, ISN'T THAT
A PRETTY SIGHT?

14:27.291 --> 14:30.250
YOU NEED TO JUST--
NO, NO, ALL RIGHT. DO YOU THINK
IT'S EVER APPROPRIATE FOR

14:30.291 --> 14:33.250
A MOTHER TO BE IMPLANTED WITH
THE EMBRYOS OF HER DAUGHTER?

14:33.291 --> 14:35.625
OH, I WAS DREADING THE CHOICE

14:35.667 --> 14:38.000
BETWEEN POWER BERRY
AND dragonfruit vitaminwater.
LOOK, OKAY, MOTHERS
ACT AS SURROGATES

14:38.041 --> 14:39.792
FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS
ALL THE TIME.

14:39.834 --> 14:42.041
IF SHARON WANTS A BABY
SO BADLY, LET HER ADOPT.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.083
SHARON DOESN'T WANT ANY CHILD.
SHE WANTS THEIR CHILD.

14:44.125 --> 14:45.583
SHE DOESN'T DESERVE IT.

14:45.625 --> 14:48.083
OH, WELL, I DON'T LIKE IT
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

14:48.125 --> 14:50.792
BUT IF I DON'T DO IT,
SHE'S JUST--
WELL, SHE JUST--

14:50.834 --> 14:52.834
SHE JUST GOES TO ANOTHER DOCTOR
FOR IMPLANTATION, RIGHT?

14:52.875 --> 14:55.083
I MEAN, THEY'RE HER PROPERTY.
BY LAW--

14:55.125 --> 14:58.083
I'M NOT SAYING THEY SHOULD BE.
SHE'S 52. THERE ARE
VERY FEW DOCTORS

14:58.125 --> 15:00.458
WHO COULD SUCCESSFULLY
IMPREGNATE A WOMAN HER AGE.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.625
IF NAOMI SAYS NO,
THEN THE PROBLEM ENDS HERE.
BUT ISN'T GETTING
OLDER WOMEN PREGNANT

15:03.667 --> 15:05.291
PART OF THE BEAUTY
OF I.V.F.?

15:05.333 --> 15:08.166
THEY GET TO HAVE TIME,
HAVE CAREERS AND STILL BE MOMS.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.166
A-AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
FOR THEIR KIDS?

15:11.208 --> 15:13.917
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE
VOLUNTEERING

15:13.959 --> 15:16.291
TO BE TEAM MOM
IN SOCCER IN YOUR 50s,

15:16.333 --> 15:20.125
OR GOING PROM DRESS SHOPPING
IN YOUR 60s?
(groans) I DON'T KNOW.

15:20.166 --> 15:23.125
MAYBE THE FACT THAT TERRI
HATED HER MOTHER

15:23.166 --> 15:25.250
MAKES THE DECISION FOR ME.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.125
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
AGE OR GRIEF.
YES, YES. SHE SHOULD NOT
BE A MOTHER.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.041
PEOPLE BECOME PARENTS

15:30.083 --> 15:33.125
AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THEIR
LIVES FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.625
IT'S NOT ALWAYS IDEAL,
BUT IF THIS WOMAN IS WILLING

15:35.667 --> 15:38.458
TO MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT
TO BE THE KIND OF PARENT

15:38.500 --> 15:40.625
SHE KNOWS
SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN BEFORE,

15:40.667 --> 15:43.041
WHY WOULD WE BE AGAINST THAT?
ISN'T THAT WHAT THIS BABY--

15:43.083 --> 15:44.917
ANY BABY--DESERVES?

15:52.917 --> 15:56.250
PRETTY GOOD TEAM,
YOU AND ME.

15:56.291 --> 15:59.500
NO, WE ARE NOT A GOOD TEAM.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.333
I MADE A LIFE HERE, ARCHER,

16:02.375 --> 16:04.333
AWAY FROM BIZZY,
AWAY FROM DEREK.

16:04.375 --> 16:07.375
I'M TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT ME.

16:07.417 --> 16:11.041
AND I CAN'T DO THAT
WITH YOU...

16:11.083 --> 16:13.125
JUDGING EVERYTHING
THAT I DO.

16:13.166 --> 16:16.000
I WILL BE
SUPREMELY SUPPORTIVE.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.959
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO STAY OUT OF MY LIFE.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.250
YOU NEVER HAVE.

16:20.291 --> 16:23.250

16:23.291 --> 16:26.542

THAT WAS GREAT.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.333

TO FEELING CONSTANTLY
OVERWHELMED AND INADEQUATE.

28:07.208 --> 28:09.834
BUT, SHARON, SHARON...

28:09.875 --> 28:11.834
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

28:11.875 --> 28:15.750
IF MOTHERHOOD FOR YOU
WAS MORE BURDEN THAN BLESSING,

28:15.792 --> 28:18.458
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO
SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THAT AGAIN?

28:18.500 --> 28:21.166
BECAUSE I WANT IT
TO BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

28:21.208 --> 28:24.041
BUT WHAT MAKES YOU ASSUME
IT COULD BE?
THE PAIN.

28:24.083 --> 28:26.041
I'VE LIVED WITH IT
EVERY SINGLE DAY

28:26.083 --> 28:27.834
WHILE SHE WAS ALIVE--

28:27.875 --> 28:30.333

28:30.375 --> 28:32.834

THAT AT SOME POINT,

28:32.875 --> 28:37.041
I WOULD BE ABLE TO...
MAKE THE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.417
(cries)

28:39.458 --> 28:41.417
I CAN'T BRING TERRI BACK,

28:41.458 --> 28:47.000
BUT I-I CAN HAVE THE CHILD
THAT SHE WANTED...

28:47.041 --> 28:50.375
AND GIVE IT LOVE
AND--AND--AND ATTENTION

28:50.417 --> 28:54.792
AND... THE SUPPORT
THAT SHE WOULD'VE...

28:54.834 --> 28:58.000
(voice breaking)
THAT SHE DESERVED...

28:58.041 --> 29:02.625
THAT EVERY CHILD DESERVES.

29:02.667 --> 29:06.709
I AM CAPABLE OF THAT.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.500
(groans)

29:12.542 --> 29:14.750
JANE, YOU'RE IN LABOR.

29:14.792 --> 29:16.750
I NEED TO DELIVER
THE BABY NOW.

29:16.792 --> 29:18.750
IT'S EARLY, BUT I THINK
IT'LL BE OKAY.

29:18.792 --> 29:21.750
I... NEED...
IT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE OF THE BABY.

29:21.792 --> 29:23.041
OKAY?

29:23.083 --> 29:24.500
I WAS SURPRISED
YOU CALLED.

29:24.542 --> 29:26.959
HEY, UM, LOOK,
THE BABY IS IN DISTRESS,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.959
AND JANE'S NOT DILATED,
BUT I CAN'T WAIT.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.959
I'VE GOTTA DO A C-SECTION NOW,
BUT SHE'S STILL

29:31.000 --> 29:33.417
ON BLOOD THINNERS
FROM YOUR PROCEDURE.

29:33.458 --> 29:36.625
I NEED TO REVERSE THEM
OR SHE WILL BLEED OUT.
THAT'LL PUT HER AT RISK
FOR ANOTHER STROKE.

29:36.667 --> 29:39.959
THE BABY CAN'T SURVIVE
WITHOUT SURGERY.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.917
UH... WHAT IF I DO
A C-SECTION WITH A SPINAL?

29:42.959 --> 29:44.917
CAN YOU DO
AN INTRAOPERATIVE E.E.G.,

29:44.959 --> 29:48.750
MONITOR THE NEURO STATUS?
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD PLAN.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.667
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
UP TO THE O.R.

29:50.709 --> 29:53.458
TIM...
I ALREADY CALLED HIM.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.500
(groans)
GO AHEAD.

30:05.417 --> 30:08.041
I WANT YOU
TO HEAR ME OUT.
I TOLD YOU ONCE, COOPER,

30:08.083 --> 30:11.583
NO MORE TALKING AND EXPRESSING.
IT'S DONE.

30:11.625 --> 30:14.625
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT COULD BE DONE.
IT COULD BE DONE AND OVER.

30:14.667 --> 30:17.500
AND THERE WOULDN'T EVEN BE THAT
MUCH MESS--YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT,

30:17.542 --> 30:19.500
WE DON'T LIVE TOGETHER,
THERE'S NO VACATIONS PLANNED,

30:19.542 --> 30:21.417
I DON'T HAVE ONE THING
AT YOUR HOUSE,

30:21.458 --> 30:24.500
AND GOD KNOWS YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE
SO MUCH AS A T-SHIRT AT MINE.

30:24.542 --> 30:27.458
BUT EMOTIONALLY,
I'M NOT READY TO LET GO.

30:29.875 --> 30:32.959
WE ARE
SO NOT THE CUTE COUPLE--

30:33.000 --> 30:34.959
IN AND OUT
OF EACH OTHER'S POCKETS,

30:35.000 --> 30:36.625
FINISHING
EACH OTHER'S SENTENCES--

30:36.667 --> 30:39.500
BUT WE'RE STILL A COUPLE.
WE'RE US.

30:39.542 --> 30:42.041
AND I LOVE US, AND I...

30:42.083 --> 30:45.583
AM NOWHERE NEAR READY
TO GIVE UP.

30:48.208 --> 30:51.542
EVEN IF YOU ARE,
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.834
WELL, WON'T THAT BE LONELY?

31:07.041 --> 31:08.542
HEY, PETE.

31:08.583 --> 31:09.709
HI.
I--

31:09.750 --> 31:12.166
HEY, WILL YOU SIGN
A 51-50 FOR KEITH EMBRY?

31:12.208 --> 31:15.166
HE'S A DRUG ADDICT.
UH, YOU--YOU CAN'T
LOCK UP AN ADDICT

31:15.208 --> 31:17.417
AND FORCE THEM
INTO TREATMENT, PETE.
YEAH, IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

31:17.458 --> 31:20.166
HE'S LIVING ON THE STREETS,
HE'S GOT NO JOB,

31:20.208 --> 31:23.375
HE'S NOT EATING,
HE'S GOT NO CLOTHES--
GRAVE DISABILITY. OKAY,
YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.

31:23.417 --> 31:26.041
YOU THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA?
I THINK--I THINK IT'S BETTER
WHEN PEOPLE WANT TREATMENT.

31:26.083 --> 31:28.208
FORCED TREATMENT
IS PROBLEMATIC.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.250
AND WITH ADDICTS--
HE'LL JUST LIE TO YOU, PETE.

31:30.291 --> 31:33.417
BUT IF HE STAYS ON THE STREETS,
HE'S GONNA DIE.
MAYBE,

31:33.458 --> 31:36.208
BUT 72 HOURS IN A PSYCH FACILITY
ISN'T GONNA CHANGE THAT.
72 HOURS TO EVALUATE,

31:36.250 --> 31:38.500
THEN THEY CAN CHOOSE TO DO
A 14-DAY HOLD, AND THEN 30 DAYS.

31:38.542 --> 31:41.166
DOES HE HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM,
A-A WIFE OR KIDS?

31:41.208 --> 31:43.792
HE HAS A WIFE,
BUT NO KIDS.

31:43.834 --> 31:45.875
THANK GOD.
THAT'D BE A DISASTER.

31:45.917 --> 31:48.875
WELL, KIDS CAN INSPIRE THINGS IN
PEOPLE THAT--THAT ADULTS CAN'T.

31:48.917 --> 31:50.875
I MEAN, IF HE'D HAD KIDS...

31:50.917 --> 31:53.041
I MEAN, WOULDN'T IT MAKE
A DIFFERENCE IF YOU'D HAD KIDS?

31:53.083 --> 31:54.834
I'M PAST THAT WINDOW.

31:54.875 --> 31:56.291
THE SAD TRUTH IS,

31:56.333 --> 31:59.250
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER THAT ANNA
AND I DIDN'T HAVE KIDS.

31:59.291 --> 32:04.458
I'M TOO SELFISH,
AND... I GET ANGRY.

32:04.500 --> 32:08.917
SO... WILL YOU SIGN
THE 51-50?

32:08.959 --> 32:11.208
YOU KNOW, I-I THINK
WHEN YOU, UH,

32:11.250 --> 32:13.125
FORCE SOMETHING ON SOMEONE
THAT THEY DON'T WANT,

32:13.166 --> 32:15.208
THEY'LL NEVER FULLY COMMIT.

32:15.250 --> 32:17.959
SO IF HE DOESN'T WANT THIS
FOR HIMSELF,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.166
HE'LL JUST WALK OUT THE DOOR.

32:22.458 --> 32:25.834
THE... BABY...

32:25.875 --> 32:27.875
ALMOST THERE, JANE.

32:27.917 --> 32:29.125
HANG IN.

32:29.166 --> 32:31.125
ANY BLEEDING?

32:31.166 --> 32:33.291
PERSISTENT OOZING
AROUND THE EDGES.

32:33.333 --> 32:36.041
ANY CHANGES IN HER E.E.G.?
NO. SHE'S FINE.

32:36.083 --> 32:39.375
BOVIE. OKAY, JANE. I'M GONNA
TAKE THE BABY OUT NOW.

32:39.417 --> 32:42.458
LAP PAD, AND HAVE
AN INTUBATION TRAY STANDING BY.

32:42.500 --> 32:46.000
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

32:48.375 --> 32:50.542
WHAT'S... WRONG?

32:50.583 --> 32:52.375
HE'S NOT BREATHING... YET.

32:52.417 --> 32:54.709
LARYNGOSCOPE
AND A SUCTION CATHETER, NOW.

32:54.750 --> 32:57.291
HE'S ASPIRATED MECONIUM.
HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE?

32:57.333 --> 32:59.291
YOU'VE GOT ABOUT 30 SECONDS.
PLEASE.

32:59.333 --> 33:01.792
OKAY, COME ON. COME ON.

33:01.834 --> 33:04.750
STAND BY WITH A 3-0 ENDOTRACHEAL
TUBE AND A VENTILATOR.
20 SECONDS, ADDISON.

33:04.792 --> 33:07.500
COME ON, BREATHE, BREATHE.
COME ON, BREATHE.

33:07.542 --> 33:12.041
(crying)

33:12.083 --> 33:15.166
HE--
HE'S OKAY.
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY, JANE.

33:15.208 --> 33:17.917
(fussing)

33:17.959 --> 33:20.166
YEAH.

33:24.875 --> 33:27.166
I THINK I WAS WRONG...

33:27.208 --> 33:29.375
ABOUT SHARON
USING TERRI'S EMBRYOS.

33:29.417 --> 33:31.041
WHAT ABOUT TERRI?

33:31.083 --> 33:33.041
WELL, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT TERRI GROWING UP,

33:33.083 --> 33:35.041
ABOUT HOW SHE MUST HAVE FELT,

33:35.083 --> 33:38.458
AND HOW KIDS INTUITIVELY KNOW
IF THEIR PARENTS RESENT THEM.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.458
BUT I WAS ALSO THINKING THAT--

33:40.500 --> 33:42.750
THAT CHILDREN ONLY SEE
ONE SIDE,

33:42.792 --> 33:44.750
AND THAT IF A PARENT
UNDERSTANDS THEIR FEELINGS

33:44.792 --> 33:48.458
AND REALLY WANTS TO CHANGE...

33:48.500 --> 33:50.458
I ACTUALLY THINK

33:50.500 --> 33:53.041
SHARON WILL BE A DIFFERENT MOM
THIS TIME AROUND.

33:53.083 --> 33:54.375
(sighs)

33:54.417 --> 33:57.166
AND SHE'S NOT JUST TRYING
TO REPLACE HER DAUGHTER?

33:57.208 --> 33:59.542
IT'S NOT GUILT?

33:59.583 --> 34:01.125
MAYBE THE FACT

34:01.166 --> 34:03.667
THAT SHE'S COMMITTED
TO BEING A GOOD MOM...

34:03.709 --> 34:07.250
MAYBE THAT'S REASON ENOUGH
TO GIVE HER A SECOND CHANCE.

34:09.667 --> 34:11.208
(knock on door)

34:11.250 --> 34:14.041
HEY.

34:14.083 --> 34:16.250
KEITH, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

34:16.291 --> 34:18.250
OH, I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.
(chuckles)

34:18.291 --> 34:20.250
I'M JUST--I'M--
I'M GOING CRAZY.

34:20.291 --> 34:23.291
I'M SORRY, PETE,
BUT I JUST--I GOT TO, MAN.

34:23.333 --> 34:26.041
NO, YOU NEED TO STAY.
I NEED YOU TO GET BETTER.

34:26.083 --> 34:28.041
ELLEN NEEDS YOU
TO GET BETTER.

34:28.083 --> 34:30.041
SHE STILL WANTS
HER HUSBAND BACK.

34:30.083 --> 34:33.041
I CAN'T BE THAT GUY
ANYMORE.
YOU CAN.

34:33.083 --> 34:36.041
I AM NOT GONNA SIT BACK AND LET
YOU HURT YOURSELF, KEITH.

34:36.083 --> 34:39.375
YOU HAVE A REAL CHANCE
TO GET CLEAN.

34:39.417 --> 34:42.208
I CAN'T.

34:44.542 --> 34:46.625
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
NO, NO.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.625
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT. NO.

34:48.667 --> 34:51.208
HEY, PETE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE COMMITTED
TO THE PSYCHIATRIC WARD

34:51.250 --> 34:52.959
OF ST. AMBROSE.
NO.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.208
THEY HAVE DOCTORS HERE

34:54.250 --> 34:57.041
WHO SPECIALIZE
IN TREATING ADDICTION.

34:57.083 --> 35:00.041
THEY CAN HELP YOU.
OH, YOU SON OF A BITCH.

35:00.083 --> 35:01.709
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

35:01.750 --> 35:05.542
ALL RIGHT! HOLD ON A SECOND.
HOLD ON A SEC...

35:07.917 --> 35:10.875
IF IT'S GONNA WORK,
HE HAS TO WANT IT.

35:10.917 --> 35:13.291
HE CAN GET THERE.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.792
HE'S NOT BEYOND HELP.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.458
HE'S NOT.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.041
(Naomi) OKAY.

35:21.083 --> 35:23.583
HERE WE GO.

35:23.625 --> 35:26.458
NO, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT, PLEASE. PLEASE WAIT.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.709
S-SHARON?

35:28.750 --> 35:32.333
WHAT IF
I'M MAKING A MISTAKE?

35:32.375 --> 35:34.041
WHAT IF...

35:34.083 --> 35:36.917
WHAT IF--WHAT IF I CAN'T
DO ANY BETTER THIS TIME?

35:36.959 --> 35:38.875
WHAT IF...
(crying) WHAT IF...

35:38.917 --> 35:41.875
WHAT IF I'M JUST DESTINED
TO BE A BAD MOTHER?

35:41.917 --> 35:43.333
SHARON.

35:43.375 --> 35:47.333
SHARON... YOU'RE NOT DESTINED
TO BE ANYTHING.

35:47.375 --> 35:50.166
YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO BE
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

35:50.208 --> 35:53.166
AND IF THE PERSON YOU WERE
BEFORE WASN'T WORKING,

35:53.208 --> 35:55.417
YOU CAN CHANGE IT,

35:55.458 --> 35:58.709
AND YOU CAN BE THE KIND OF
MOTHER THAT YOU THINK THAT

35:58.750 --> 36:02.542
THAT BABY--
THAT TERRI'S BABY--DESERVES.

36:02.583 --> 36:04.542
AND IF YOU COMMIT TO THAT

36:04.583 --> 36:06.750
AND YOU DECIDE
THAT IT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

36:06.792 --> 36:08.959
IT'LL BE AMAZING...

36:09.000 --> 36:11.959
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
THIS IS THE CHANCE
YOU WANTED, RIGHT?

36:16.583 --> 36:19.000
THEN TAKE IT.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.166
(sniffles)

36:22.208 --> 36:24.250
OKAY.

36:24.291 --> 36:26.750
OKAY.

36:40.291 --> 36:42.583
HEY.

36:42.625 --> 36:44.250
HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

36:44.291 --> 36:47.750
BREATHING ON HIS OWN--
YOU DID GOOD, JANE.

36:47.792 --> 36:51.417
(whispers) YEAH.
YES, YOU DID.

36:53.542 --> 36:56.041
YOU WANT ME
TO HAND YOU THE BABY?

36:56.083 --> 36:57.041
(sniffles)

36:57.083 --> 37:01.417
I'M... GLAD...
YOU'RE HERE.

37:03.625 --> 37:05.667
(whispers indistinctly)

37:05.709 --> 37:07.041
HERE YOU GO.

37:07.083 --> 37:09.000

37:21.041 --> 37:23.458
(sniffles and whispers)
HI, BABY.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.041
(Tim speaks indistinctly)

37:26.083 --> 37:27.750

37:30.083 --> 37:32.041
YEAH.
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.041
YES, HE DOES.
SONYA IS A PROBLEM.
WE HAVEN'T...

37:35.083 --> 37:37.041
SEALED THE DEAL.
ST--WELL, WE'VE TRIED.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.041
BUT I JUST--
I GET NERVOUS,

37:39.083 --> 37:41.083
