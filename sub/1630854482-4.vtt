Okay, um...

45:10.795 --> 45:12.971
so what does --
what does that mean?

45:13.014 --> 45:16.148

run a bunch more tests.

45:16.191 --> 45:18.498
All sorts of letters.

45:18.541 --> 45:23.895
ALT, AST, ALP.

45:25.287 --> 45:27.333
And I just kept hearing
my mama say,

45:27.376 --> 45:29.291
"You should've been
a doctor, William."
