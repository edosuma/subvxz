00:16.202 --> 00:17.903
Revenge!

00:17.937 --> 00:21.139
Boba Fett, son of the notorious
bounty hunter Jango Fett,

00:21.173 --> 00:24.609
infiltrated a Jedi cruiser
in an attempt to assassinate

00:24.644 --> 00:28.880
general Mace Windu, the man
who killed his father.

00:28.915 --> 00:31.983
After a near miss at Windu's
quarters, Boba was forced

00:32.051 --> 00:34.519
to destroy the Jedi cruiser
and escape with the help

00:34.587 --> 00:37.956
of notorious bounty hunter Aurra Sing.

00:37.990 --> 00:41.026
Now, having lost contact
with Admiral Kilian when

00:41.060 --> 00:44.930
his doomed starship crashed,
the Jedi search for survivors

00:44.964 --> 00:48.567
with the aid of a
Republic rescue ship.

00:51.370 --> 00:54.472
General Windu, we're picking up
the last of the survivors now.

00:54.540 --> 00:56.541
It's critical to get them
to a hospital station

00:56.576 --> 00:58.143
as soon as possible.

00:58.177 --> 01:00.278
We'll contact you as soon as
our search for Admiral Kilian

01:00.313 --> 01:01.446
is complete.

01:03.182 --> 01:05.150
Let's go, Artoo.

01:13.826 --> 01:15.794
We're coming up on the crash site.

01:15.861 --> 01:17.996
Let's hope Admiral Kilian
and the command crew

01:18.064 --> 01:20.065
are still in one piece.

01:25.171 --> 01:28.406
Hmm, looks pretty bad, but the
bridge seems to be intact.

01:28.441 --> 01:29.608
Set down behind the cruiser.

01:29.675 --> 01:31.610
We'll approach on foot.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:46.559 --> 01:47.225
Huh!

01:47.259 --> 01:48.960
You're not kidding, little buddy.

01:48.995 --> 01:51.129
I don't like the feel
of this place either.

01:51.163 --> 01:53.698
Your astromech is programmed to feel?

01:53.766 --> 02:00.505
Artoo is kind of a...
He's got a lot of personality, that's all.

02:00.539 --> 02:02.507
You encourage it too much.

02:12.885 --> 02:15.920
R8, start scanning the
area for signs of life.

02:15.955 --> 02:18.423
And calculate an entry
point to the cruiser.

02:22.962 --> 02:23.962
You're right, Artoo.

02:23.996 --> 02:25.764
It doesn't look good.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.141
A bit jittery, isn't it?

02:36.208 --> 02:37.475
He must have seen something.

02:39.645 --> 02:40.378
Come on.

02:40.413 --> 02:44.115
It looks like r8 has
found an entry point.

02:49.455 --> 02:51.022
There would have been a
command crew left aboard

02:51.090 --> 02:53.758
to try and land this ship,
Admiral Kilian and then at least

02:53.826 --> 02:55.760
three navigational officers.

02:55.828 --> 02:59.197
Commander ponds stayed as well.

03:17.149 --> 03:18.917
What did you find, little guy?

03:20.586 --> 03:23.922
Mace, over here!

03:27.660 --> 03:28.727
Hmm.

03:28.761 --> 03:31.362
This man did not die in the crash.

03:31.397 --> 03:33.832
He was executed.

03:33.866 --> 03:35.633
There's another one over here.

03:35.701 --> 03:37.001
Same thing.

03:37.036 --> 03:39.270
We know the assassins were after me.

03:39.338 --> 03:41.906
Perhaps they returned
to look for my body.

03:41.941 --> 03:44.375
We need to get to the bridge
to find Admiral Kilian.

03:44.443 --> 03:47.545
Send the droids to scan for
any survivors down here.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.814
Maybe the killer missed one.

03:49.882 --> 03:53.184
I know there's a lot of
interference, but do your best.

03:53.252 --> 03:55.420
Skywalker!

04:31.390 --> 04:36.895
They're dead, executed
like the troopers below.

04:36.929 --> 04:40.165
But I don't see Admiral
Kilian or commander ponds.

04:40.232 --> 04:41.666
They must have been
sucked into space when

04:41.700 --> 04:43.668
the cabin lost pressure.

04:47.006 --> 04:50.608
Captain, there's no sign
of any life down here.

04:50.676 --> 04:53.978
I'm afraid Admiral Kilian and
commander ponds are lost.

04:54.013 --> 04:56.614
Take the survivors back
to the hospital station.

04:56.682 --> 04:58.216
We'll meet you there.

Dooku might pay us for killing Windu.

To get paid, we need
proof of Windu's death.

And if we killed Skywalker,
we can ask for double.

08:06.338 --> 08:07.472
Double?

08:07.506 --> 08:08.639
Yes.

08:08.674 --> 08:10.575

11:44.522 --> 11:45.522
Don't worry.

11:45.556 --> 11:48.425

everything under control.

11:51.495 --> 11:53.797

all this climbing involved.

11:57.168 --> 11:58.235
Shut up already!

11:58.269 --> 12:00.604
It wasn't my idea for you
to tag along anyway.

12:31.369 --> 12:33.370
Oh, this is no good.

12:33.404 --> 12:36.506

Strangely enough, he had a
son-- or at least a clone

19:06.556 --> 19:09.057
he regarded as a son.

19:09.092 --> 19:11.293
His name is Boba Fett.

19:11.327 --> 19:12.861

19:12.929 --> 19:15.964
Obi-Wan listed him in

Indeed.

19:44.093 --> 19:47.562
Artoo will come through.

20:04.547 --> 20:05.681
There, in the bridge!

20:05.715 --> 20:06.815
I can see them.

20:08.084 --> 20:11.820
Ahsoka, hold the ship steady.

20:20.330 --> 20:23.265
Comet, let's go!

20:25.635 --> 20:27.970
Hurry, commander Wolffe.

20:28.037 --> 20:29.404
Hold tight, general.

20:29.439 --> 20:32.074
We're losing it, sir.

20:38.614 --> 20:41.683
Jump!

20:41.718 --> 20:44.152
Cut the lines.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.154
Go!

21:05.208 --> 21:07.876
But nothing a night in the
bacta tank won't fix.

21:09.178 --> 21:10.579
Oh, sorry.

21:10.613 --> 21:13.382
We were lucky to arrive when we did.

21:13.416 --> 21:15.484
Guess we have Artoo to thank for that.

21:17.687 --> 21:19.287
Come here, droid.

21:21.657 --> 21:25.594
I can see why your master
trusts you, little one.

21:25.661 --> 21:27.462
Good job.

21:31.334 --> 21:32.134
Ha!

21:32.201 --> 21:34.870
That's definitely more
praise than I ever get.

21:34.904 --> 21:37.205
Hmm.

22:06.737 --> 22:08.738
This isn't what I wanted.

22:13.644 --> 22:15.444
You don't have to do this.

22:15.479 --> 22:17.113
You're not like them.

22:17.147 --> 22:18.181
I can tell.

22:18.248 --> 22:19.916
What do you know, old man?

22:19.950 --> 22:22.919
I know a good soldier when I see one.

22:22.986 --> 22:24.287
I'm no soldier.

22:24.321 --> 22:26.923
I'm no clone, not like those two.

22:26.957 --> 22:27.723

22:31.662 --> 22:33.629
Nothing.

22:38.335 --> 22:39.969
What are we gonna do with them?

22:40.003 --> 22:44.240
Oh, I think our friends here are
about to finally prove useful.

22:45.909 --> 22:46.542
Slap!

23:01.625 --> 23:06.329
So what are you planning to do
with this son of Jango Fett?

23:06.363 --> 23:08.798
I'm not planning to do anything.

23:08.866 --> 23:11.901
That kid destroyed an entire
cruiser trying to get to you,

23:11.935 --> 23:13.703
and you're just gonna let it go?

23:13.770 --> 23:17.173
Is there something else I
should be doing, Skywalker?

23:17.241 --> 23:19.442
How about tracking him down?

23:19.476 --> 23:21.811
So I should behave as this child does?

23:21.879 --> 23:23.779
I should seek revenge.

23:23.814 --> 23:25.147
No.

23:25.215 --> 23:29.252
How is it revenge if you stop this
kid and bring him to justice?

23:29.286 --> 23:34.590
In case you hadn't noticed,
we are fighting a war.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.692
We have a situation.

23:36.727 --> 23:42.932
We received a transmission
from the bounty hunters.

23:42.966 --> 23:47.303
They apparently took hostages.

23:47.337 --> 23:51.207
Mace Windu, you were lucky to escape.

23:51.241 --> 23:53.876
Your friends here were
not so fortunate.

23:53.944 --> 23:58.314
Until you face Boba, these men
will be killed one at a time.

23:58.348 --> 24:00.750
What's your name?

24:00.784 --> 24:02.485
Name!

24:02.519 --> 24:04.954
Ct-411.

24:05.022 --> 24:06.055
Ugh, pathetic.

24:06.123 --> 24:09.492
Boba, do it.

24:09.526 --> 24:13.029
Boba!

24:16.500 --> 24:18.768
Only two to go, Windu.

24:18.802 --> 24:20.403
Come and find us.

24:20.470 --> 24:23.406
We'll be waiting.

24:23.473 --> 24:24.941
I'll go.

24:24.975 --> 24:27.276
I thought you had bigger concerns.

24:27.311 --> 24:30.579
That was before we knew
hostages were involved.

24:30.647 --> 24:34.583
You are too injured to travel,
and your presence would only

24:34.618 --> 24:36.285
aggravate the boy.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.755
I shall go and take
Padawan Tano with me.

24:54.838 --> 24:57.940
Next time I tell you to pull
the trigger, you do it.

25:05.349 --> 25:10.987
It should only be a matter of
time until they track us down.

25:11.054 --> 25:14.623
Something on your mind, Castas?

25:14.691 --> 25:17.360
Yeah, I got something to say.

25:17.427 --> 25:19.428
We're in over our heads.

25:19.463 --> 25:20.963
You signed on to kill Jedi.

25:21.031 --> 25:22.531
Well, this is how it's done.

25:22.599 --> 25:26.068
You said the separatists would
pay well if we killed Windu.

25:26.103 --> 25:28.971
That kid destroyed an entire cruiser,

25:29.039 --> 25:31.040
and now we're taking hostages.

25:31.074 --> 25:33.576
That was not part of the plan.

25:33.610 --> 25:36.312
I never took you for a coward, Castas.

25:36.346 --> 25:37.780
And what about you, bossk?

25:37.848 --> 25:39.148
You feel the same?

25:39.182 --> 25:41.050
I'm still in.

25:41.084 --> 25:46.022
I got a lot riding on this
kill, and I need the cash.

25:46.056 --> 25:47.056
Not me.

25:47.124 --> 25:48.224
I'm out.

25:48.291 --> 25:50.226
Well, then you're in luck.

25:50.293 --> 25:52.128
I was planning on making a stop.

25:52.195 --> 25:54.397
You can drag your worthless
carcass off of this ship

25:54.431 --> 25:55.498
when we land.

25:55.565 --> 25:56.599
Where are we headed?

25:56.633 --> 25:58.868
We're going to visit an old friend.

25:58.902 --> 26:01.237
Maybe he can replace Castas.

26:01.304 --> 26:04.306
Set course for Florrum.

26:17.354 --> 26:20.022
Master PLO, I don't understand.

26:20.057 --> 26:22.725
Shouldn't we be heading for the
last place we knew Boba Fett

26:22.759 --> 26:23.592
was spotted?

26:23.627 --> 26:29.298
Why head to the one place
we know he is not?

26:39.376 --> 26:43.846
Whoa.

26:43.880 --> 26:48.117
The second bounty hunter in
the hologram is Aurra Sing.

26:48.185 --> 26:50.219
Another bounty hunter.

26:50.287 --> 26:53.389
Like his father, Jango Fett.

26:53.457 --> 26:54.824
Yes.

26:54.891 --> 26:58.394
It seems this boy found himself
in the care of at least one of

26:58.428 --> 27:01.363
Jango's associates.

27:01.398 --> 27:03.566
So we're looking for
friends of Jango Fett

27:03.633 --> 27:05.301
or places where they hang out.

27:05.368 --> 27:12.174
And to do that, we must go to the
lower levels, the underworld.

35:59.322 --> 36:01.457
Jedi, by the look of it.

36:01.525 --> 36:02.358
Windu.

36:02.426 --> 36:03.359
Finally.

36:03.393 --> 36:04.960
Took them long enough.

36:04.995 --> 36:06.629
<i>Move slave I to the outskirts</i>

36:06.696 --> 36:08.431
and get the hostages ready.

36:08.465 --> 36:10.232
Right.

36:10.267 --> 36:14.437
So are you in or not?

36:14.504 --> 36:19.074
I will not help you, but I
will not hinder you either.

36:19.142 --> 36:23.512
This is your fight, not mine.

36:57.814 --> 37:01.650
Hello, hello, and welcome to Florrum.

37:01.685 --> 37:05.955
I should assume you are
walking us into a trap.

37:05.989 --> 37:07.423
Yes, you should.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.492
They're waiting inside the bar.

37:09.526 --> 37:13.329
I have no idea what she
has planned for you.

37:13.396 --> 37:18.767
And the reason you are telling us is?

37:18.802 --> 37:21.136
Involved in this.

37:21.171 --> 37:25.140
Remember, patience.

37:38.488 --> 37:40.456
Bad move, Jedi.

37:40.490 --> 37:42.625
This will cost you.

37:42.659 --> 37:44.260
I wanted Windu.

37:44.327 --> 37:46.095
What are you doing here?

37:46.162 --> 37:49.965
We can do this the difficult
way or the simple way.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.001
The choice is yours.

37:52.068 --> 37:53.903
Bossk.

37:53.937 --> 37:55.237
Can you hear me?

37:55.272 --> 37:56.505
Roger.

37:56.540 --> 37:59.241
Execute the hostages
if I give the word.

37:59.276 --> 38:01.243
Unwise.

38:01.278 --> 38:04.413
You have already lost, and
you don't even know it.

38:04.447 --> 38:09.568
I am prepared to kill you, the
hostages, whatever it takes

38:09.602 --> 38:11.570
to get what Boba wants.

38:11.604 --> 38:13.872
Sounds more like what you want.

38:15.041 --> 38:17.476
Clang!

38:17.510 --> 38:19.478
Don't.

38:22.282 --> 38:23.582
Aurra.

38:23.616 --> 38:25.217
Aurra.

38:25.285 --> 38:27.219
Bad news, boys.

38:27.287 --> 38:35.094
If I don't hear from her soon,
I'm gone, and you're both fried.

38:35.128 --> 38:36.662
Let her go.

38:36.696 --> 38:38.764
No chance.

38:38.798 --> 38:40.099
She won't do it, Boba.

38:40.133 --> 38:41.734
She's not like you.

38:41.768 --> 38:43.268
She's right.

38:43.303 --> 38:44.903
I'm not a murderer.

38:44.938 --> 38:46.205
I'm not a murderer.

38:46.239 --> 38:48.273
But I want justice.

38:48.308 --> 38:50.843
We are justice.

38:50.877 --> 38:53.479
Don't listen to them.

38:53.513 --> 38:58.817
No one will be harmed
if you come quietly.

38:58.852 --> 39:00.819
I can't let you die.

39:00.854 --> 39:03.355
You won't have to.

39:06.126 --> 39:08.694
Click!

39:09.863 --> 39:10.696
Aurra!

39:11.498 --> 39:13.699
Smack!

39:13.733 --> 39:15.334
Thunk!

39:20.073 --> 39:20.973
It's over.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.142
Surrender.

39:23.176 --> 39:25.511
Aurra, now!

39:26.279 --> 39:27.880
Bomb!

39:30.950 --> 39:34.787
Boba, hurry.

39:34.854 --> 39:35.854
Aurra, help!

39:35.889 --> 39:37.856
Help me!

39:41.761 --> 39:43.328
Don't leave me!

39:43.396 --> 39:45.697
No!

39:45.765 --> 39:48.500
The hostages, where are they?

39:48.568 --> 39:51.336
Boba, if you do not tell
us where those men are,

39:51.404 --> 39:54.206
they are going to die, innocent men.

39:54.240 --> 39:56.208
She left me.

39:59.646 --> 40:01.113
Smack!

40:19.833 --> 40:23.001
He will not reveal the
location of the hostages.

40:23.036 --> 40:26.905
I thought you might talk
some sense into him.

40:26.973 --> 40:31.977
Tell the Jedi what he
wants to know, Boba.

40:32.011 --> 40:33.345
Why should I help anybody?

40:33.379 --> 40:34.880
I've got no one.

40:34.914 --> 40:39.451
It is the honorable thing to do.

40:39.485 --> 40:42.788
It's what your father
would have wanted.

41:05.211 --> 41:09.347
Ahsoka, she is trying to lead
you away from the hostages.

41:09.382 --> 41:12.817
Go to coordinates 1579.

41:22.328 --> 41:25.797
Time's up.

41:31.270 --> 41:34.072
Don't move.

41:48.955 --> 41:51.256
Ahh! Ah!

42:15.147 --> 42:15.780
No!

42:15.848 --> 42:16.481
Come on!

42:39.905 --> 42:43.575
I see now I've done terrible
things, but you started it

42:43.609 --> 42:45.310
when you murdered my father.

42:45.378 --> 42:47.245
I'll never forgive you.

42:47.313 --> 42:50.048
Hmm.

42:50.082 --> 42:53.151
Well, you're going to have to.

42:53.219 --> 42:55.287
Take him away.
