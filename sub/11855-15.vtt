WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:09.458
I want you to know
I've always thought

00:09.542 --> 00:11.125
of both of you as my boys.

00:12.458 --> 00:13.583
Sarah.

00:15.291 --> 00:17.000
I know you're right.

00:17.083 --> 00:18.291
It's best not to cry.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.917
Colin, are you ready? If we
don't go soon, we'll be
late.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.709
I can't find Mr. Wilson.

00:29.792 --> 00:31.500
He can stay here.

00:31.583 --> 00:33.125
But I told him about the movie.

00:33.208 --> 00:36.041
How the dinosaurs get out,
and take over the island.

00:36.125 --> 00:37.208
Honey?

00:37.291 --> 00:39.041
Have you checked Wilson's hutch?

00:42.750 --> 00:44.625
Hey, Mr. Wilson!

00:48.583 --> 00:50.375
Thanks, mom.

00:50.458 --> 00:51.792
I wish you could come.

00:51.875 --> 00:55.792
I know, honey,
but I should rest.

00:55.875 --> 00:59.041
You should rest.
You're tired.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.250
Mm.

01:02.125 --> 01:04.333
How old is Mr. Wilson?

01:04.417 --> 01:06.125
Three? Four?

01:06.208 --> 01:08.291
Can he go to the movie?

01:08.375 --> 01:10.000
Is it rated R?

01:10.083 --> 01:12.625
Honey, Mr. Wilson's a rabbit.

01:12.709 --> 01:15.417
So he ages in rabbit years.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.291
- Different from person years?
- Mm-hmm.

01:18.375 --> 01:19.667
To you, Mr. Wilson's young

01:19.750 --> 01:22.625
but he's actually
lived
a good, long time.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.083
A good long time.

01:29.917 --> 01:32.250
Hey, what's wrong?

01:34.750 --> 01:36.834
Oh, it's just, uh

01:36.917 --> 01:38.959
here you are, my big boy

01:39.041 --> 01:40.500
going out on your own.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.208
- I wish you could come.
- No.

01:44.291 --> 01:47.542
You should save your
wishes
for something big.

01:49.041 --> 01:50.375
Something important.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.417
Because wishes come true.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.333
We need to go, Colin.
It's time.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.291
Good-bye!

02:50.166 --> 02:51.333
You ain't cold?

02:53.208 --> 02:55.458
Nope.

02:55.542 --> 02:58.250
Hey, I got a couple more
hand warmers if you need
'em.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.667
Well, those chemical things
you crush up?

03:00.750 --> 03:02.208
Nah, I'm good.

03:11.834 --> 03:12.917
So, uh..

03:15.333 --> 03:16.750
...someone's leaving
these
at the grave?

03:16.834 --> 03:18.834
Yeah, anniversary of his death.

03:18.917 --> 03:20.417
'Three years running.'

03:20.500 --> 03:22.250
(Valens)
'Kid died by train?'

03:22.333 --> 03:24.417
(Rush)
'Filed as an accident,
but, um..'

03:24.500 --> 03:26.917
...does make it look like
someone trying to say
different.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.917
Well, why not come
into
Homicide to say it?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.583
It's free coffee.

03:32.667 --> 03:33.959
[scoffs]
Central
heat.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.792
- Lil, I know Chris told
you.
- Let's not talk about it--

03:41.875 --> 03:43.166
Uh, if I gave you
a wrong
impression--

03:43.250 --> 03:46.166
Scotty, we're at work,
so let's just work.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.333
Okay?

03:52.959 --> 03:54.125
Look.

04:01.291 --> 04:02.625
Philadelphia Police.

04:04.542 --> 04:06.542
'What's your name?'

04:06.625 --> 04:08.959
- Nathan Hicks.
- You knew this kid, Colin?

04:09.041 --> 04:10.917
Yeah, I used to take care
of him.

04:11.041 --> 04:13.750
So you know, it's
the anniversary of his death.

04:13.834 --> 04:15.125
That's why I'm here.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.542
You come here every year?

04:17.625 --> 04:20.375
[sighs]
No, it's the first
time.

04:20.458 --> 04:23.291
Mm. Never put anything
on the grave?

04:25.750 --> 04:28.500
I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:28.583 --> 04:30.875
How about taking a
ride
with us, Nathan?

04:47.917 --> 04:49.083
Valens.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.041
We saw "Jurassic Park."

05:35.125 --> 05:36.792
And I lost him
in the
bathroom.

05:36.875 --> 05:39.417
Any idea why he went
to the tracks?

05:39.500 --> 05:40.750
They were familiar.

05:40.834 --> 05:43.083
He'd walk that way
home from school.

05:43.166 --> 05:44.750
And how long did you know Colin?

05:44.834 --> 05:46.125
Three years,
I picked him
up

05:46.208 --> 05:47.750
from school
a few times a
week.

05:47.834 --> 05:50.834
- Looked at his homework.
- So you were a baby-sitter.

05:50.917 --> 05:53.291
[chuckles]
What? Yeah.

05:54.417 --> 05:55.333
He needed someone.

05:55.417 --> 05:56.959
Where were the parents?

05:57.041 --> 05:58.917
Uh, dad was out
of the picture.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.417
Sarah worked
supermarket checkout

06:00.500 --> 06:02.125
as many shifts as she could get.

06:02.208 --> 06:04.834
And Colin had some kind
of...condition?

06:04.917 --> 06:07.083
He was limited,
needed extra
care.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.917
So you and Sarah
looked out for him

06:09.000 --> 06:11.166
and then, Sarah got sick?

06:11.250 --> 06:12.875
Breast cancer.

06:12.959 --> 06:13.959
It killed her.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.792
Know who might have
done these?

06:19.542 --> 06:21.250
Anyone who disliked Colin?

06:21.333 --> 06:23.208
Wanted to hurt him?

06:23.291 --> 06:25.375
Only other people he
knew
were at his school.

06:25.458 --> 06:27.291
And there,
it could have been
anybody.

06:27.375 --> 06:28.834
Why's that?

06:28.917 --> 06:31.792
Colin was loving, trusting.

06:31.875 --> 06:34.583
Everything kids that
age
can't be.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.792
So, open season
on the slow kid?

06:41.709 --> 06:44.792
Um, wh-where's Colin?
Have you seen him?

06:44.875 --> 06:46.959
Colin Miller.

06:49.917 --> 06:51.375
Thanks.

06:51.458 --> 06:52.959
'Colin?'

06:53.041 --> 06:54.250
Colin?

06:54.333 --> 06:55.458
'Colin!'

06:56.208 --> 06:57.333
What happened?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.417
He said they would fly.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.709
He said...
he'd make them fly.

07:01.792 --> 07:03.250
Who said?

07:03.333 --> 07:06.417
It's her-her birthday,
and he said she'd like
it.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.625
That it would be...magic.

07:11.583 --> 07:12.875
They're all mush.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.625
I can't give Leah
mush for her
birthday.

07:17.709 --> 07:20.500
It's totally not as bad
as last time.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.792
I mean,
he's still got his
underwear.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.583
Josh, what happened?

07:24.667 --> 07:27.917
Some kid told Colin that he
could make the Valentines
fly.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.083
- Then I guess he just--
- They kind of flew.

07:30.166 --> 07:32.208
- For a second.
- Some kid? Who?

07:34.709 --> 07:36.500
Nathan?

07:36.583 --> 07:38.834
How's Leah gonna know..

07:38.917 --> 07:40.834
...that I love her

07:40.917 --> 07:42.125
if they're mush?

07:45.583 --> 07:47.709
Make a wish.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.667
Fountains are the best place
to make a wish about feelings.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.875
Everyone knows that.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.583
I wish..

08:05.125 --> 08:07.083
...for Leah to know..

08:07.166 --> 08:08.542
...how much I love her.

08:15.792 --> 08:16.875
It worked.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.792
I could feel it working.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.083
What did I tell you?

08:27.834 --> 08:29.583
That was an average day.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.417
And there were worse.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.083
Had Sarah tried putting him
in a special school?

08:34.166 --> 08:35.250
She had no money.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.166
She paid me
in sandwiches sometimes.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.959
Typed up my college
applications.

08:40.166 --> 08:41.333
Would this kid, Josh know

08:41.417 --> 08:43.917
'who had it in
for Colin at school?'

08:44.000 --> 08:45.750
Yeah, he was his friend.

08:45.834 --> 08:48.458
Or...the closest thing
Colin had to one.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.583
You the guys
with the groceries?

08:55.667 --> 08:58.041
No, and we ain't
housekeeping
either.

08:58.125 --> 09:00.125
Homicide.
Can we come in?

09:00.208 --> 09:02.583
Yeah, I don't really
have visitors.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.542
[sniffs]
Never guessed.

09:04.625 --> 09:07.625
I try to limit
my social interface.

09:07.709 --> 09:09.458
It's about Colin Miller.

09:09.542 --> 09:11.375
Died 12 years ago today.

09:11.458 --> 09:12.875
Yeah.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.333
What do you know about that?

09:14.417 --> 09:15.542
Train hit him.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.667
Accident, they said.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.583
You think
something
different?

09:24.250 --> 09:25.458
What's this?

09:25.542 --> 09:27.000
Just a picture of my old boss.

09:28.542 --> 09:31.125
From before your limited
interface thing?

09:31.208 --> 09:32.375
Yeah.

09:32.458 --> 09:33.792
Well, looks like
it's the same
artist.

09:35.333 --> 09:36.333
Josh, you trying
to say something

09:36.417 --> 09:37.834
about how Colin died?

09:37.917 --> 09:40.250
- I don't know how he died.
- Sit down.

09:40.333 --> 09:43.125
Then why do you keep leaving
these pictures at his grave?

09:43.208 --> 09:44.375
It's just something for him.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.500
But today,
you left one on my
car.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.959
Maybe I wanted a live person
to see it.

09:53.208 --> 09:55.625
(Rush)
'Is this Colin on the
tracks?'

09:55.709 --> 09:56.792
No.

09:58.333 --> 09:59.917
That's Colin and me.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.542
The guy on the tracks is Mac.

10:01.625 --> 10:02.959
(Vera)
'Who's that?'

10:04.875 --> 10:06.291
[gasping
]
Don't!

10:08.083 --> 10:10.083
Don't what?

10:10.166 --> 10:11.709
Don't hurt Mr. Wilson.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.041
Is that what I'm doing?
Hurting him?

10:20.542 --> 10:21.750
Yes!

10:21.834 --> 10:22.959
(Mac)
'Hey, you're right.'

10:23.041 --> 10:24.959
I can hear him crying.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.542
- No! Stop it!
- Hey!

10:28.625 --> 10:29.959
I'll give you your bunny back.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.667
'It's easy.'

10:32.750 --> 10:36.208
All you have to do
is say please.

10:40.625 --> 10:42.208
Please? Aah!

10:43.417 --> 10:44.917
(Mac)
'Oh, no!'

10:45.875 --> 10:47.041
Look what you made me do.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.917
Oh, whatever.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.917
(Mac)
'Stupid..'

11:04.000 --> 11:05.959
'...pansy..'

11:06.041 --> 11:07.208
...retard!

11:13.166 --> 11:14.792
You stay away from her.

11:16.417 --> 11:17.875
You hear me?

11:30.041 --> 11:32.083
That picture's us.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.458
Our revenge on Mac
if we'd been strong enough.

11:35.834 --> 11:38.583
So you don't act
on these artistic visions?

11:38.667 --> 11:40.208
You just draw them out?

11:40.291 --> 11:41.750
Right.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.917
Who did Mac want Colin
to stay away from?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.750
His girlfriend, Leah.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.333
This have to do
with the
Valentine's?

11:48.709 --> 11:49.917
The music room.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.667
He jumped her.

11:54.208 --> 11:57.000
Like...sexually?

11:57.083 --> 11:59.792
(Josh)
'Colin was the nicest guy
on Earth.'

11:59.875 --> 12:02.041
But I guess he was still a guy.

12:08.750 --> 12:11.625
Sexual assault charge was
filed
against Colin, then dropped.

12:11.709 --> 12:12.959
We know why?

12:13.041 --> 12:15.291
Matter was settled privately.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.333
The guy messes
with Mac's girlfriend.

12:17.417 --> 12:18.625
Mac's got motive.

12:18.709 --> 12:20.208
Colin have any
history
of violent behavior

12:20.291 --> 12:21.458
before the assault?

12:21.542 --> 12:22.625
None.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.000
So who did he pick
it
up from? Dad?

12:24.083 --> 12:26.625
Well, he had nothing to do
with Sarah or her kid.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.083
It could have been native.

12:28.166 --> 12:30.125
The way I hear
with those special guys

12:30.208 --> 12:31.500
everything they lose up here

12:31.583 --> 12:33.583
they get back down here
with interest.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.333
Try DHS.
Colin was special
needs.

12:35.417 --> 12:37.750
- They'll have a file on
him.
- Got the rap sheet on Mac.

12:37.834 --> 12:40.166
- How does it look?
- Uh, it's a misdemeanor
buffet.

12:40.250 --> 12:43.041
Vandalism, resisting
arrest,
simple assault.

12:43.125 --> 12:44.458
Just my type.

12:44.542 --> 12:45.709
Wanna go have a chat?

12:47.834 --> 12:50.083
Uh, Leah's up with Jeffries.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.375
Yeah, good.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.125
Haven't thought about Colin
for a long time.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.542
That's Detective Rush.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.583
We heard there was an incident
in the music room?

13:06.667 --> 13:08.750
- Right.
- How did it happen?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.125
It was after school.
Colin came in.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.542
Started to kiss me.
Wouldn't stop.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.875
[sighs]
Then my boyfriend,
Mac walked in..

13:18.291 --> 13:19.959
...luckily.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.125
You've told this story a lot.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.875
Yeah.

13:23.959 --> 13:25.834
Oh, you know Mac gave Colin
a beating for that.

13:27.625 --> 13:28.834
'Your idea?'

13:29.959 --> 13:32.041
His.

13:32.125 --> 13:34.750
It was the one thing Mac did
my parents approved of.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.041
Your folks didn't like him?

13:37.125 --> 13:40.041
My mother collects Emily
Post's
books on manners.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.917
Mac's big hobby was seeing
how far he could spit.

13:44.709 --> 13:47.375
Oh, he was your rebellion.

13:47.458 --> 13:48.917
Beauty and the beast.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.500
Every girl tries it once.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.375
So Mac pummels Colin
at the tracks.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.875
Any other fallout?

13:58.625 --> 14:01.250
While Mac went after Colin..

14:02.458 --> 14:05.041
...my parents
went after his mom.

14:08.959 --> 14:11.417
Colin's father
wasn't able to make it?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.208
He's not part of Colin's life.

14:13.291 --> 14:15.083
I could change that
with a civil suit

14:15.166 --> 14:16.750
against both of you..

14:16.834 --> 14:20.000
...for what your son
did to Leah.

14:20.083 --> 14:23.959
(Sarah)
'Colin's sorry about
what happened. So am I.'

14:24.041 --> 14:27.250
Not to mention
the criminal investigation.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.750
- Dad.
- Colin isn't dangerous.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.417
If he misunderstood--

14:31.500 --> 14:34.208
We can't risk
his misunderstandings.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.959
Well, you said
you wanted to discuss
options.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.667
Um, why don't we do that?

14:42.750 --> 14:45.208
My family's thought it over.

14:45.291 --> 14:47.583
We'd like Colin
to leave the school.

14:47.667 --> 14:50.041
It could be the best
thing
for him.

14:50.125 --> 14:53.500
'Another school with kids
more like himself.'

14:55.208 --> 14:56.458
Another school.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.500
I don't have the money.

14:59.583 --> 15:03.458
Maybe a home, hospital, um..
Whatever you do with--

15:03.542 --> 15:06.125
But we do
fine.
Colin and me.

15:06.208 --> 15:07.417
Not if your boy can't keep it--

15:07.500 --> 15:08.583
We do fine.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.000
Miss Miller

15:12.083 --> 15:13.959
pull Colin out of school

15:14.041 --> 15:16.125
'or we'll go forward.'

15:16.208 --> 15:17.500
Civil and criminal.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.333
Colin, honey, we're going.

15:25.417 --> 15:26.500
I'm sorry.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.750
You can have Mr. Wilson
if you want.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.041
He was gone
by the next Monday.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.375
I never saw him again.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.333
Sounds like you weren't
a hundred percent

15:53.417 --> 15:54.917
behind this meeting.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.041
No.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.875
Or the...beat down.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.834
You don't think Mac
hurting
Colin did any good?

16:05.291 --> 16:06.542
Made Mac feel good.

16:08.667 --> 16:11.792
I'm not sure Colin even knew
what he was doing, really.

16:14.792 --> 16:16.083
But I know Mac did.

16:20.917 --> 16:22.625
Yeah, I remember the retard.

16:22.709 --> 16:24.083
Well, you remember
the beating you gave him

16:24.166 --> 16:25.458
at the train tracks?

16:27.917 --> 16:30.333
He tried to rape my girlfriend.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.291
He needed a lesson.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.041
A violent lesson.

16:34.125 --> 16:36.041
I figured a guy like that..

16:36.125 --> 16:38.208
Getting physical's
the only way he's gonna
learn.

16:38.291 --> 16:40.000
Some deep thought
you put into that.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.250
Hey, I remember the guy.
What else you wanna know?

16:42.333 --> 16:45.166
This little school of yours,
it only had one session?

16:45.250 --> 16:47.125
You ever feel the need
to take Colin back down

16:47.208 --> 16:48.417
for a refresher course?

16:48.500 --> 16:49.667
Wait, hold up.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.250
You're asking about
how he died now?

16:51.333 --> 16:54.375
- Yeah, and if you killed
him.
- Get real, fellas.

16:54.458 --> 16:56.417
You got a temper,
and he gave you a reason.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.041
What I gave that
reject,
he had comin'.

17:02.458 --> 17:04.291
But it's what happened after

17:04.375 --> 17:05.959
that's really screwed up.

17:07.667 --> 17:08.959
Who's got the brewskis?

17:10.291 --> 17:11.875
No one, dude.

17:11.959 --> 17:13.291
Great.
You guys are geniuses.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.166
Stupid!

17:18.250 --> 17:19.500
You pansy!

17:19.583 --> 17:20.792
Retard!

17:26.041 --> 17:28.166
- It's okay, Josh.
- No, it's not okay.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.000
I make you tired, I know.

17:33.291 --> 17:34.750
I make my mom tired.

17:34.834 --> 17:36.542
She ain't tired.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.458
I'll have to stay with my dad..

17:38.542 --> 17:41.166
...while she goes to
the
hospital to get some
rest.

17:42.875 --> 17:43.959
She ain't tired.

17:45.333 --> 17:46.542
'She's sick.'

17:47.792 --> 17:48.917
She's gonna die.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.000
No.

17:54.083 --> 17:57.083
And your dad,
he ain't gonna save you.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.291
I bet he hates you.

17:59.375 --> 18:03.291
I bet he hates you because
you are too stupid to live.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.458
Maybe I'll just put you
out of your misery.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.500
Yeah.

18:16.959 --> 18:18.125
That's what I thought.

18:23.709 --> 18:25.291
I thought you were
Colin's friend, Josh.

18:25.375 --> 18:26.834
(Josh)
'I was.'

18:26.917 --> 18:28.500
(Rush)
'That's why you gave him
a follow-up beat down'

18:28.583 --> 18:30.667
after Mac and his pals
were done?

18:30.750 --> 18:33.333
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that!

18:33.417 --> 18:36.041
See, this is exactly
why I keep to myself.

18:36.125 --> 18:38.125
- To avoid stuff like this.
- Like what?

18:39.500 --> 18:40.959
Like getting
fingered
for murder

18:41.041 --> 18:42.583
'cause I happen to be weird.

18:42.667 --> 18:43.834
Oh, what was the deal, Josh?

18:43.917 --> 18:45.542
You're the second lowest
guy on the food chain

18:45.625 --> 18:48.792
so to feel powerful,
you go and drop the lowest guy?

18:48.875 --> 18:51.709
Makes you feel good
for a minute.

18:51.792 --> 18:52.792
I didn't kill Colin.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.083
No, you just kicked his ass

18:54.166 --> 18:55.500
and threatened him a little.

18:56.792 --> 18:59.458
I know I wasn't great to him.

18:59.542 --> 19:01.583
- But I liked him.
- Really?

19:03.417 --> 19:04.875
Yeah.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.792
He was nice to me.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.041
It doesn't happen a lot.

19:13.291 --> 19:16.166
New information
from DHS about dad.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.458
What about him?

19:17.542 --> 19:19.417
Oh, he wasn't doing
too hot financially.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.542
Yeah, putting it mild.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.000
He spent most of the early 90s

19:22.083 --> 19:23.917
skating just the side
of bankruptcy.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.834
Never paid a cent
of child support.

19:25.917 --> 19:27.000
Nice.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.625
Yeah, but not surprising
considering this guy

19:28.709 --> 19:29.834
divorced Sarah as soon as

19:29.917 --> 19:31.709
Colin's condition
got found out.

19:31.792 --> 19:35.000
- What's that, boss?
- Uh, Sarah's medical
history.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.625
She got through a
bout
of cancer in '89

19:36.709 --> 19:39.166
but it came back in
'92
with a vengeance.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.333
This kid's got all the luck.

19:40.417 --> 19:42.750
Mom was dying,
and when she did..

19:42.834 --> 19:45.333
The burden of caring
for Colin would fall on dad.

19:45.417 --> 19:46.417
Who didn't want him.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.083
How much of a burden we talking?

19:48.166 --> 19:49.834
Couple years with this.

19:49.917 --> 19:51.917
He wouldn't have
gotten out from under.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.125
So it's lucky
for him Colin died.

19:54.208 --> 19:56.250
Yeah, real lucky.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.166
We got a word
for that kind of luck.

20:21.709 --> 20:22.792
Scotty.

20:24.375 --> 20:25.458
Hey.

20:29.542 --> 20:31.417
(Christina)
'I found another place.'

20:32.250 --> 20:33.542
Starting tonight.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.625
I ain't kickin' you out.

20:36.709 --> 20:38.083
You've been really nice.

20:40.041 --> 20:42.625
[sighs]
But I'm
going..

20:42.709 --> 20:44.000
...today.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.375
Well, I tried talking to Lil.

20:48.458 --> 20:49.834
That was brave.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.083
'Yeah, well..'

20:51.166 --> 20:53.375
...she didn't really
wanna go into it.

20:54.417 --> 20:55.959
Deep freeze, huh?

20:56.041 --> 20:57.542
Yeah.

20:57.625 --> 20:58.875
I'm familiar.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.667
Why do you two
get along so bad?

21:05.250 --> 21:07.333
There was a thing..

21:07.417 --> 21:09.041
...with her fiance.

21:09.125 --> 21:10.834
She was engaged?

21:10.917 --> 21:13.000
Nine years back.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.250
We all loved the guy.

21:15.875 --> 21:19.667
Till one night,
she was out late on
patrol.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.959
He has a beer too many.

21:22.041 --> 21:25.542
Uh, I think
I'm hearing too much.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.333
Yeah, okay.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.291
I guess I just remind her
of that time.

21:33.917 --> 21:34.959
Him.

21:38.417 --> 21:39.709
Hey, Chris, uh..

21:41.041 --> 21:42.291
Yeah?

21:44.834 --> 21:47.667
You've helped me
in hard times, you know.

21:49.834 --> 21:50.834
I know.

21:57.750 --> 21:58.750
See you later.

22:19.375 --> 22:21.291
Richard Miller,
Colin's father.

22:21.375 --> 22:22.750
I got eight minutes for this.

22:22.834 --> 22:24.125
It's about your son's death.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.625
Big reaction.

22:28.709 --> 22:31.291
- Wasn't really my kid.
- Biologically, you mean?

22:31.375 --> 22:32.959
Psychologically.

22:33.041 --> 22:35.417
Sarah and I, we broke up
real quick after he was born.

22:36.917 --> 22:38.291
What was the problem?

22:38.375 --> 22:39.667
Couldn't stand
looking at a retard

22:39.750 --> 22:41.000
knowing he was related to you?

22:42.333 --> 22:44.750
Yeah, that was a problem.

22:46.875 --> 22:48.792
All that kid
ever brought me was trouble.

22:48.875 --> 22:50.709
Oh, you can't mean
emotional trouble

22:50.792 --> 22:51.917
since you were never around.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.709
So you must be talking money.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.208
(Stillman)
'We looked into
your finances, Richard.'

22:57.291 --> 22:59.667
Taking on Colin after Sarah
died
would have ruined you.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.417
So I killed him?

23:01.500 --> 23:04.125
You benefited from his
death.
It's something we notice.

23:04.208 --> 23:07.291
Look, you can be as shocked
or disgusted as you want.

23:07.375 --> 23:09.208
Fact is..

23:09.291 --> 23:11.417
...I didn't care
enough to kill him.

23:17.041 --> 23:20.709
And this is hadrosaurus..

23:20.792 --> 23:22.792
...the duck-billed dinosaur.

23:22.875 --> 23:24.709
Sarah, this has been nice, but--

23:24.792 --> 23:26.250
Mom says you're
a paleontologist.

23:26.333 --> 23:27.834
Colin.

23:27.917 --> 23:30.458
She says you go on digs
all over the world.

23:30.542 --> 23:31.917
Trying to explain why
you're not around.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.125
Yeah, you know,
I got a shift startin',
so..

23:35.208 --> 23:39.291
Richard, I didn't ask you
here just for cookies.

23:42.458 --> 23:43.750
I need you to take him.

23:43.834 --> 23:46.166
I'm gonna be
hospitalized
again.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.083
You're gonna be okay.
You've kicked this before.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.834
It's not like before.
I had to quit my job.

23:50.917 --> 23:52.333
I've got nothing coming in.

23:52.417 --> 23:54.625
If you don't take him,
they'll stick him
somewhere.

23:54.709 --> 23:55.959
Somewhere he belongs.

23:56.041 --> 23:57.542
You've never seen
those places.

23:57.625 --> 23:58.959
What they'd do to him there.

23:59.041 --> 24:02.041
- You're getting hysterical.
- He is your son.

24:02.125 --> 24:04.542
How do you not care about him?

24:04.625 --> 24:07.250
Just once,
Richard.
Just this once.

24:07.333 --> 24:10.125
Dad, I've got some pictures
of mom and me. You wanna see?

24:10.208 --> 24:11.458
Colin, listen.
I'm sorry, but I--

24:11.542 --> 24:13.166
But you gotta. Look.

24:15.250 --> 24:18.333
This is us last year
at Halloween.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.417
I'm a raisin.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.625
'And..'

24:23.291 --> 24:25.250
...this is us
at Mother's Day.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.291
- Who's that?
- 'Nathan. He's my friend.'

24:30.375 --> 24:32.625
He loves me,
and mommy too.

24:33.625 --> 24:34.875
Does he now?

24:36.250 --> 24:37.542
You'll be fine, Sarah.

24:37.625 --> 24:39.458
Looks to me like you got
all the help you need.

24:46.250 --> 24:48.250
Later I found out
it was three years

24:48.333 --> 24:49.959
'she'd been seein' that kid.'

24:50.041 --> 24:51.291
You think it was romantic?

24:51.375 --> 24:52.875
I don't know how
she did it, bein' sick.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.083
But from what I saw,
she had him lined up.

24:56.166 --> 24:57.875
And you could tell
all that from a photo?

24:57.959 --> 25:01.667
That, plus the next day,
this kid comes by my house.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.250
Cusses me out
for making her cry.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.375
I gotta get hit over
the head more than that?

25:17.709 --> 25:19.875
Ladies.

25:19.959 --> 25:22.250
Hey, am I
interrupting
a party?

25:22.333 --> 25:25.125
My wife's baby shower.
I'm kind of exiled.

25:25.208 --> 25:27.208
- You got a minute then.
- Yeah.

25:28.667 --> 25:31.000
We talked to Colin's dad,
Richard.

25:31.083 --> 25:32.250
Charmer, right?

25:32.333 --> 25:35.250
Well, he said your
relationship
with Sarah was..

25:35.333 --> 25:37.125
...more than professional.

25:37.208 --> 25:38.417
What would he know?

25:39.834 --> 25:41.667
So?

25:41.750 --> 25:43.333
[sighs]
It wasn't
romantic.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.625
But, uh, it was intense.

25:45.709 --> 25:47.417
Maybe a little too intense.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.792
- They had such big problems.
- Sarah and Colin.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.375
What was wrong with them,
I couldn't fix.

25:53.542 --> 25:56.083
I was a kid.

25:56.166 --> 25:59.458
- And it was just a job.
- 'And you were gettin'
out.'

25:59.542 --> 26:01.125
I'd finished two
years
at a junior
college.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.417
Got a
scholarship
to Middlebury.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.583
Vermont?

26:03.667 --> 26:05.375
Even up there,
I couldn't escape
it.

26:05.458 --> 26:06.917
Now what happened?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Uh, I went up there for a
week
to set up loans, housing.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.333
A few days in,
I get a call from
her.

26:10.417 --> 26:11.333
About Colin?

26:11.417 --> 26:12.542
She'd woken up in the hospital.

26:12.625 --> 26:13.709
Didn't know where he was.

26:13.792 --> 26:14.875
It had been three days.

26:14.959 --> 26:16.291
She asked you to find him.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.166
So I hauled ass
back to Philly.

26:19.959 --> 26:21.875
I won't be able to release
him
into your custody without--

26:21.959 --> 26:24.000
- I have it.
- ...a sign-off from a
judge.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.792
I have it. It just took me five
hours and about 80 phone calls.

26:26.875 --> 26:28.417
I didn't design the system.

26:29.959 --> 26:31.458
Why's he in a different section?

26:31.542 --> 26:35.000
He's high risk. Record shows
a sexual assault charge.

26:41.667 --> 26:42.709
Beautiful.

26:43.917 --> 26:44.917
Colin?

26:50.917 --> 26:52.000
'Colin?'

26:53.709 --> 26:54.834
'Colin?'

26:56.208 --> 26:57.417
Colin!

26:57.500 --> 26:59.417
Colin! Hey!

26:59.500 --> 27:00.750
Hey!

27:05.125 --> 27:06.792
Colin?

27:08.417 --> 27:09.542
Nathan.

27:11.792 --> 27:13.208
You came.

27:14.875 --> 27:16.166
Are you alright?

27:18.792 --> 27:20.000
I wished..

27:23.333 --> 27:25.000
...and you came.

27:31.333 --> 27:33.041
And that was Colin.

27:33.125 --> 27:35.166
Middle of a
nightmare,
calls it a..

27:35.250 --> 27:37.458
...a wish come true.

27:37.542 --> 27:40.041
- You get him out of there?
- Took him home.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.375
Stayed there till Sarah
got back from the
hospital.

27:42.458 --> 27:44.333
That's a lot
for a 19-year-old to handle.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.166
Look, I don't wanna
sound heartless but,
uh..

27:48.250 --> 27:50.041
...it wore on me.

27:50.125 --> 27:51.291
It was..

27:51.375 --> 27:52.750
More than you signed on for.

27:54.709 --> 27:57.250
You said he had
that rabbit with him.

27:57.333 --> 28:00.667
- Yeah. Mr. Wilson.
- Well, you know how he got
it?

28:00.750 --> 28:02.166
Uh, for his
birthday,
when he was 15.

28:02.250 --> 28:03.917
No, 'cause Colin
gave it to Leah

28:04.000 --> 28:05.458
as an apology for the assault.

28:05.542 --> 28:06.917
That sounds like him.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.041
If he had it at the hospital,
he must have gotten it back.

28:09.125 --> 28:10.417
What? From Leah?

28:10.500 --> 28:13.000
Why would she go back?
To see the guy who..

28:13.083 --> 28:15.291
Attacked her?

28:15.375 --> 28:16.542
Yeah.

28:18.166 --> 28:19.291
That's a good question.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.959
You told us Colin
gave you his rabbit

28:32.041 --> 28:33.667
when he came to your house.

28:33.750 --> 28:36.083
- Right.
- Know what happened to it?

28:36.166 --> 28:39.041
- Probably got thrown away.
- Uh, actually, no.

28:39.125 --> 28:40.959
He got it back.

28:41.041 --> 28:42.166
He got it back from you.

28:44.166 --> 28:45.959
I don't know how.

28:46.041 --> 28:49.667
Well, we have a 911 call
with your voice on it.

28:49.750 --> 28:52.583
Calling an ambulance
from his apartment.

28:52.667 --> 28:55.166
'Now, I almost overlooked it,
there were so many calls'

28:55.250 --> 28:56.959
'made near the end there.'

28:57.041 --> 28:59.375
Sarah wasn't doing so well.

28:59.458 --> 29:01.333
I know.

29:01.417 --> 29:02.542
Hmm.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.667
[sighs]
Let's start
again.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.000
What aren't you telling me?

29:14.375 --> 29:16.542
I went to apologize to him.

29:16.625 --> 29:18.542
For what?

29:18.625 --> 29:20.458
The music room.

29:20.542 --> 29:21.625
The assault.

29:22.792 --> 29:23.959
There wasn't one.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.792
Nothing happened?

29:28.875 --> 29:31.709
Colin was sitting
with me at the
piano.

29:31.792 --> 29:33.667
'He started talking
about his mom.'

29:35.667 --> 29:37.667
How...he loved her..

29:39.333 --> 29:40.625
...just like he loved me.

29:43.583 --> 29:44.750
I felt for him.

29:45.959 --> 29:47.542
So I let him kiss me.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.250
Then Mac came in.

29:51.333 --> 29:52.625
- Got the wrong idea?
- Yes.

29:52.709 --> 29:53.750
You didn't try
to give him the right one?

29:53.834 --> 29:54.875
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

29:54.959 --> 29:56.834
Because I was stupid.

29:56.917 --> 29:59.625
[sobbing]
Because I thought,
"What will people say?"

30:00.959 --> 30:02.208
'"Leah's a slut."'

30:03.625 --> 30:05.792
"Leah wants to make it
with the retard."

30:08.625 --> 30:10.583
Mac assumed he attacked me..

30:12.959 --> 30:14.166
...and I went along.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.375
Even when your parents
got involved?

30:18.458 --> 30:21.250
I thought maybe Colin
should leave the
school.

30:21.333 --> 30:22.458
Maybe somewhere else..

30:23.834 --> 30:25.375
...they'll be nicer to him.

30:28.792 --> 30:29.875
Well..

30:31.083 --> 30:32.625
...it didn't work out
like that.

30:34.625 --> 30:35.750
No.

30:37.834 --> 30:40.750
How did you end up
making that 911 call?

30:44.333 --> 30:46.250
It's freezing
in here,
Colin.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.500
Hmm. Yeah.

30:49.458 --> 30:50.417
How about some light?

30:50.500 --> 30:52.166
Uh, I'm not supposed
to see you.

30:55.291 --> 30:57.291
Umm, Mr. Wilson asked me
to come.

31:00.792 --> 31:03.792
I like him a lot, but..

31:05.125 --> 31:06.458
...he really misses you.

31:14.417 --> 31:16.166
I'm sorry for what I did.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.750
No, Colin.

31:19.875 --> 31:20.834
I'm sorry.

31:23.041 --> 31:24.792
I lied.

31:24.875 --> 31:26.083
You did?

31:27.542 --> 31:29.291
Yes.

31:29.375 --> 31:32.125
I said something bad happened

31:32.208 --> 31:33.792
but it didn't.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.375
I told you,
you could kiss
me.

31:43.041 --> 31:44.375
I'm hungry.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.375
Have you had lunch?

31:47.458 --> 31:49.709
I'm not supposed
to open the fridge..

31:49.792 --> 31:51.458
...or the cupboards.

31:51.542 --> 31:53.083
I'm supposed to wait for mom.

31:54.875 --> 31:57.250
- Where is she?
- Taking a bath.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.208
A long one.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.542
How long?

32:06.625 --> 32:08.125
She went in two days ago.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.291
Where's that guy
that takes care of you?

32:13.375 --> 32:15.500
'In Vermont, but I'm not
supposed to interrupt'

32:15.583 --> 32:17.959
when she's in the bath.

32:18.041 --> 32:19.792
'I'm gonna go
to Vermont with him'

32:19.875 --> 32:21.375
if mom gets really sick.

32:29.291 --> 32:30.709
Sarah was practically dead.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.750
She had been unconscious
for a day and a half.

32:36.417 --> 32:38.959
And Colin got swept away
by social services.

32:39.041 --> 32:41.250
They said they'd take
him
to the proper place.

32:44.125 --> 32:46.041
Colin thought he was
gonna live with Nathan?

32:48.458 --> 32:49.709
I don't know
if it was
true..

32:51.083 --> 32:52.917
...or just another
lie
someone told him.

32:55.750 --> 32:56.917
It was a mistake, Leah.

32:58.458 --> 32:59.834
[sighs]
As far as lies go..

33:02.041 --> 33:03.417
...yours isn't the worst.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.709
Okay. Hey!

33:23.792 --> 33:26.125
Enough with the ice queen, Lil.

33:26.208 --> 33:28.041
- Just hit me with it
already.
- No, I got nothing to say.

33:28.125 --> 33:29.625
Oh, you wanna drop
this thing? Great.

33:29.709 --> 33:31.083
But you ain't dropping, you're
giving me daggers all day
long--

33:31.166 --> 33:33.166
And you don't deserve that.

33:33.250 --> 33:35.792
Lil, I'm an adult.

33:35.875 --> 33:37.583
I don't need your permission
to go out with someone.

33:37.667 --> 33:40.083
[laughs]
It's not
someone,
it's my sister.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.458
So what?
What's that to you?

33:47.250 --> 33:48.417
You lied to my face.

33:50.542 --> 33:53.917
Look, you asked me
in front of everybody.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.458
I'm gonna say with Vera
and the boss right there

33:55.542 --> 33:57.041
"Yeah, yeah, Chris and me
are stepping out."

33:57.125 --> 33:59.750
Okay, oh, you're right.
Lying was the right
thing.

33:59.834 --> 34:02.667
- I'm gonna see who I want,
Lil.
- Great, great. God bless.

34:02.750 --> 34:05.000
I can't help whatever happened
nine years ago.

34:08.166 --> 34:09.250
She's trouble.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.750
- Well, maybe to me, she's
not.
- Fine, Scotty.

34:12.834 --> 34:14.542
But, uh, whoring it out
with a cocktail waitress

34:14.625 --> 34:16.333
won't bring back
your dead
girlfriend.

34:18.583 --> 34:20.000
(Jeffries)
What's going on?

34:27.709 --> 34:28.834
Nothin'.

34:30.417 --> 34:31.792
Turns out
Nathan was more active

34:31.875 --> 34:33.917
in seeing to Colin's future
than he said.

34:36.250 --> 34:38.000
Yeah? How?

34:38.083 --> 34:41.875
Well, records in Vermont show he
applied to be Colin's guardian.

34:41.959 --> 34:44.333
Vermont. That's where
he was going to school.

34:44.417 --> 34:47.750
The registrar at Middlebury has
his request for family housing.

34:47.834 --> 34:49.834
Oh, so Colin
could
live with him.

34:49.917 --> 34:52.000
Well, he told me
it was just a job.

34:52.083 --> 34:55.542
That, uh, Sarah and Colin were
getting to be too much for him.

34:55.625 --> 34:58.542
He might have wanted out, but
he was just getting deeper in.

35:14.834 --> 35:16.583
I don't understand.
I've told you everything.

35:16.667 --> 35:19.500
You didn't tell us you tried
to get custody of Colin.

35:19.583 --> 35:20.917
I didn't think it was important.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.542
Really? 'Cause I think
the opposite.

35:22.625 --> 35:24.875
I think you tried to hide
it
'cause you knew it was.

35:24.959 --> 35:26.834
(Rush)
'You felt trapped.'

35:26.917 --> 35:28.166
If you got stuck with Colin

35:28.250 --> 35:29.875
your whole life
would get ripped away.

35:29.959 --> 35:31.917
Yeah, but how do you say
no to a dying woman?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.458
That's not how it was.

35:33.542 --> 35:35.375
(Valens)
'She was handin' you
a life sentence.'

35:35.458 --> 35:36.583
And you didn't have
the guts

35:36.667 --> 35:38.291
to just turn
your back on 'em.

35:38.375 --> 35:41.959
So, your only way out
was to get rid of Colin.

35:42.041 --> 35:43.250
Lose him at the movies.

35:43.333 --> 35:45.000
Lose him for good.

35:45.083 --> 35:47.208
I loved Colin.

35:47.291 --> 35:48.542
I wanted to take him..

35:48.625 --> 35:49.750
...but they wouldn't let me.

35:49.834 --> 35:50.709
Who wouldn't?

35:50.792 --> 35:52.917
The responsible agencies.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.208
We got the call that morning.
I was too young.

35:55.291 --> 35:56.625
Lacked the necessary skills.

35:56.709 --> 35:57.709
To care for a minor?

35:57.792 --> 35:59.959
A minor with special needs..

36:00.041 --> 36:02.125
...who posed
a possible sexual threat.

36:05.959 --> 36:07.959
If only I had been older..

36:08.041 --> 36:09.375
If he hadn't
attacked
that girl.

36:09.458 --> 36:10.750
Nathan, he didn't.

36:13.166 --> 36:14.583
[sighs]
Leah..

36:14.667 --> 36:16.125
'...let the story
get out of hand.'

36:17.375 --> 36:19.375
[sighs]
Well.

36:20.625 --> 36:22.750
Well, if Sarah had known that..

36:22.834 --> 36:24.208
It would have been different?

36:24.291 --> 36:25.625
She fought so hard for him.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.041
I don't think anyone
could have fought harder.

36:29.125 --> 36:33.083
But she was sick...and
finally
had to give up.

36:33.166 --> 36:35.417
With both of us gone, the
world
was gonna eat him alive.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.709
And we couldn't do anything
to stop it.

36:39.166 --> 36:40.917
Well, you could do one thing.

36:46.083 --> 36:48.667
Did Sarah ask you to take him
to the tracks that night?

36:56.750 --> 36:58.125
It was never..

37:00.542 --> 37:02.000
...specific.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.834
How did it go today?

37:07.917 --> 37:09.959
It's the end.

37:10.041 --> 37:12.417
Of this round?
They're starting something new?

37:12.500 --> 37:15.542
No, Nathan.
They gave me a hospice
registry.

37:17.291 --> 37:18.917
Hospice?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.250
Where they make you
comfortable..

37:21.333 --> 37:22.875
...when there's nothing
else to do.

37:25.333 --> 37:26.834
So, uh, that's it?

37:29.291 --> 37:30.417
That's it.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.166
Nathan, you're here.

37:34.250 --> 37:36.333
We can go to the movies.

37:36.417 --> 37:37.917
What movie?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.041
"Jurassic Park."

37:41.250 --> 37:42.875
You'll have to get your coat.

37:46.417 --> 37:47.834
What's gonna happen to him?

37:49.542 --> 37:51.166
I'll handle it.

37:51.250 --> 37:53.458
How? They turned down
your application--

37:53.542 --> 37:55.917
Sarah, I'll handle it.

38:00.083 --> 38:01.166
Okay.

38:03.875 --> 38:05.500
I want you to know..

38:05.583 --> 38:10.333
[sobbing]
...I've always thought
of both of you as my boys.

38:10.417 --> 38:11.583
Sarah..

38:12.834 --> 38:13.875
I know.
You're right.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.750
It's best not to cry.

38:20.917 --> 38:23.125
Nathan, I've been thinking.

38:24.583 --> 38:26.959
Maybe if I wished,
I could make mommy better.

38:28.834 --> 38:30.375
Sounds like a good idea.

38:30.458 --> 38:32.667
And I think I can do it.

38:32.750 --> 38:36.125
Because that wish I made
in the fountain about Leah?

38:36.208 --> 38:37.750
Yeah?

38:37.834 --> 38:39.375
It came true.

38:39.458 --> 38:43.125
And then later, I wished
for you in the hospital

38:43.208 --> 38:45.208
and that came true too.

38:45.291 --> 38:46.375
It did.

38:47.625 --> 38:51.083
I wished by the phone,
where people make calls

38:51.166 --> 38:52.333
so you'd hear me.

38:54.834 --> 38:56.792
That was pretty smart of you.

38:56.875 --> 38:59.542
So, maybe I could wish
and make mommy better.

39:02.041 --> 39:05.875
Colin, what-what she
needs
is to get stronger.

39:05.959 --> 39:07.041
Stronger?

39:09.000 --> 39:12.083
You mean,
strong like a train?

39:12.166 --> 39:13.375
'Yeah.'

39:14.583 --> 39:17.250
Then this is the perfect place.

39:19.917 --> 39:21.208
I'll stand on the tracks..

39:22.834 --> 39:24.041
...and wish..

39:25.625 --> 39:27.000
...real hard.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.542
You think that will work?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
[sighs]
It sounds good to me.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.333
Okay.

39:43.625 --> 39:44.959
Thanks, Nathan.

43:36.750 --> 43:37.667
