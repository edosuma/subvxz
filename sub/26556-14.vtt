WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:02.393
PREVIOUSLY ON "ARROW"...

00:02.437 --> 00:03.568
THERE WAS A FIRE
IN THE APARTMENT.

00:03.612 --> 00:04.917
YOUR MOM WAS
IN THERE.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.658
IT WASN'’T THE FIRE
THAT KILLED HER.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.312
YOUR MISSION IS
ABOUT REVENGE.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.010
JOHN: DANTE'’S A PERSON.
LYLA: HE IS THE FINANCIER

00:10.053 --> 00:11.402
BEHIND DOZENS
OF TERRORIST ATTACKS.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.143
DEPUTY DIRECTOR BELL.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.319
WE'’RE IN THE PROCESS
OF REINSTATING
THE GHOST INITIATIVE.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.843
RESTORING THE PROGRAM
IS THE ONLY WAY WE
CAN GET DANTE

00:17.887 --> 00:19.628
WITHOUT A.R.G.U.S.
OVERSIGHT.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.673
WE WERE ABLE TO BACKTRACE
THE NUMBER DIAZ CALLED.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.501
IT BELONGS TO DANTE'’S
CONTACT VIRGIL.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.416
BLACKSTAR'’S OUR ONLY LEAD
ON FINDING THOSE BOMBS.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.852
[DART WHOOSHES]

00:26.896 --> 00:28.289
FELICITY'’S STILL
ALIVE.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.855
[GRUNTING]

00:29.899 --> 00:31.031
YOU'’RE NOT
GONNA SHOOT ME.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.510
MY NAME IS MIA SMOAK.

00:32.554 --> 00:33.990
I'’M FELICITY'S DAUGHTER

00:34.034 --> 00:35.035
AND YOUR SISTER.

00:40.344 --> 00:41.606
[BABY CRYING]

00:41.650 --> 00:43.304
I'’M COMING, I'M COMING!

00:43.347 --> 00:45.697
[CRYING CONTINUES]

00:45.741 --> 00:47.395
WHERE ARE YOU?
I CAN'’T FIND YOU!

00:49.745 --> 00:52.530
OH, OH, AAH!

00:52.574 --> 00:55.533
I'’LL ALWAYS FIND YOU...

00:55.577 --> 00:58.101
BOTH OF YOU.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.885
YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.713
YOU STAY AWAY
FROM ME AND MY FAMILY!

01:01.757 --> 01:04.194
[GASPS]

01:04.238 --> 01:06.718
YOU CAN'’T PROTECT
YOUR BABY.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.242
[GASPS]

01:18.904 --> 01:21.081
WILLIAM, IT'’S YOUR DAD AGAIN,

01:21.124 --> 01:23.300
AND I DON'’T KNOW IF YOU'RE
GETTING MY MESSAGES, BUDDY,

01:23.344 --> 01:25.737
BECAUSE YOU'’RE NOT
RETURNING MY CALLS.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.739
I TRIED--I TRIED
CALLING THE HOUSE.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.741
LOOK. I KNOW THAT I'’M NOT
YOUR GRANDPARENTS'’ FAVORITE,

01:29.785 --> 01:31.917
BUT FELICITY AND I,
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW

01:31.961 --> 01:33.528
HOW YOU'’RE SETTLING IN,
AND WE WOULD LOVE
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE

01:33.571 --> 01:35.095
BECAUSE WE REALLY MISS Y--

01:35.138 --> 01:37.314
VOICE: THE MAILBOX
IS NOW FULL. GOOD-BYE.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.360
HE'’S STILL NOT
ANSWERING YOUR CALLS.

01:39.403 --> 01:40.883
NO.

01:40.926 --> 01:43.407
ZOE FROZE ME OUT
WHEN I FIRST LOST CUSTODY.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.496
DON'’T WORRY.
HE'’LL COME AROUND.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.585
YOU JUST GOT TO
BE PATIENT.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.892
PATIENCE IS NOT REALLY
MY THING, RENE,

01:49.935 --> 01:52.808
BUT THANK YOU.

01:52.851 --> 01:55.593
ANY WORD ON WHEN DINAH
IS COMING BACK?

01:55.637 --> 01:57.769
WELL, SHE'’S ALREADY
TRIED TO CHECK HERSELF

01:57.813 --> 01:59.902
OUT THE HOSPITAL
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

01:59.945 --> 02:03.123
PATIENCE IS ALSO NOT
REALLY HER THING.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.603
-WORKING A NEW CASE?
-NOT EXACTLY.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.605
IT'’S FOR YOUR
SISTER. YEAH.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.172
THAT'’S STILL WEIRD
TO SAY OUT LOUD.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.391
OK, RENE, LOOK.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.219
OUR TEAM HAS BEEN DEPUTIZED

02:12.262 --> 02:14.090
TO WORK WITH THE SCPD.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.614
SHE HASN'’T BEEN.
SHE SHOULDN'’T BE OUT THERE

02:16.658 --> 02:20.009
AS A VIGILANTE,
AND I WOULD ACTUALLY
REALLY APPRECIATE

02:20.052 --> 02:21.619
IF YOU DIDN'’T
ENCOURAGE HER.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.578
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I COULD STOP HER?

02:23.621 --> 02:25.188
STUBBORNNESS RUNS
IN THE FAMILY.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.973
BESIDES,
THIS IS PERSONAL.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.281
WHY?

02:31.325 --> 02:34.023
THIS IS THE BULLET
THAT KILLED HER MOTHER.

02:35.981 --> 02:38.245
HER MOTHER
WAS MURDERED?

02:38.288 --> 02:40.334
-SHE DIDN'’T TELL YOU?
-NO.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.118
LOOK. I'’M NOT TRYING
TO GET IN THE MIDDLE
OF ANY FAMILY DRAMA.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.554
TOO LATE.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.168
HER MOTHER WAS MURDERED
OVER A YEAR AGO.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.039
-OHH.
-EMIKO'’S BEEN TRYING TO FIND

02:50.082 --> 02:51.649
THE KILLER
EVER SINCE,

02:51.693 --> 02:54.043
BUT ALL SHE'’S FOUND
WERE DEAD ENDS.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.263
THIS BULLET IS HER
ONLY LEGIT LEAD.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.134
DOES SHE HAVE ANY REASON
TO BLAME MY FAMILY

02:58.178 --> 02:59.657
FOR HER MOTHER'’S DEATH?

02:59.701 --> 03:01.833
Y'’ALL DID BECOME
STARLING CITY ROYALTY

03:01.877 --> 03:03.618
WHILE SHE AND HER MOM
WERE LEFT TO STRUGGLE
IN THE GLADES.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.315
ALL I'’M SAYING IS
THERE'’S A DIFFERENCE

03:05.359 --> 03:07.448
BETWEEN TRUST
AND TRUST FUND.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.450
-SHE TRUSTS YOU?
-THAT'’S BECAUSE I HAD TO PROVE

03:09.493 --> 03:12.061
TO HER
THAT SHE COULD.

03:12.104 --> 03:15.238
OK. I'’LL PROVE IT, TOO.

03:22.506 --> 03:25.466
JUST LIKE
MY FATHER TAUGHT ME.

03:25.509 --> 03:28.077
HE SHOULD HAVE TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO AIM, BOY.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.470
YOU'’D BE LUCKY
TO BREAK SKIN.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.123
DO YOU TWO
EVER STOP TALKING?

03:43.875 --> 03:45.399
OOPS.

03:45.442 --> 03:48.228
JOHN: THAT IS ENOUGH.
YOU'’RE SUPPOSED TO BE TRAINING,

03:48.271 --> 03:49.707
NOT TRYING TO
KILL EACH OTHER.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.449
CUPID: AWW. WHY YOU
GOT TO RUIN ALL THE FUN?

03:54.973 --> 03:57.759
THE OP IN CAIRO
WAS A BUST.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.414
DANTE'’S EMISSARY
VIRGIL MANAGED
TO EVADE US.

04:00.457 --> 04:03.112
VIRGIL WAS
OUR ONLY CONTACT TO DANTE.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.114
ALL THAT EFFORT
TO TRICK DIAZ INTO
GIVING UP THE NUMBER,

04:05.157 --> 04:06.768
AND WE'’RE BACK
TO SQUARE ONE.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.378
NOT COMPLETELY.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.727
WE STILL HAVE
THE RECORDS FROM
VIRGIL'’S PHONE.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.294
THAT COULD LEAD
US TO DANTE.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.688
MEANTIME, DANTE IS
WREAKING HAVOC,

04:13.731 --> 04:15.342
FINANCING TERRORISTS
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.300
I WAS HOPING TO BE DONE
WITH THIS GROUP BY NOW.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.954
I KNOW. THE ONLY
THING ANYONE KNOWS
ABOUT THIS OPERATION

04:18.997 --> 04:21.391
IS THAT DIAZ IS A PART
OF THE GHOST INITIATIVE,

04:21.435 --> 04:23.524
BUT THE LONGER THIS
TAKES, THE MORE LIKELY

04:23.567 --> 04:25.395
A.R.G.U.S. BRASS IS TO
FIND OUT THE REAL REASON

04:25.439 --> 04:28.964
FOR THE GHOST INITIATIVE
IS TO GO AFTER DANTE.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.880
IT'’S TIME TO TELL
OLIVER AND FELICITY.

04:31.923 --> 04:35.144
OUR POSITION NOW IS
RISKIER THAN EVER.

04:35.187 --> 04:38.190
THE LESS SECRETS WE HAVE,
THE BETTER.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.196
MY SISTER?

04:48.026 --> 04:49.637
NO. THAT'’S NOT POSSIBLE.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.075
I WISH IT WASN'’T,
BUT HERE I AM.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.816
NOW, GET THE DAMN GUN
OFF ME.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.774
ZOE: HE WILL WHEN
YOU STOP LYING.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.298
IT JUST DOESN'’T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.169
WE ALL KNEW
OLIVER
AND FELICITY.

05:00.212 --> 05:02.171
THEY NEVER HAD
A DAUGHTER.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.391
GUESS YOU DIDN'’T KNOW
THEM AS WELL AS YOU THINK.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.610
IS THIS TRUE?
IS SHE THEIR KID?

05:06.654 --> 05:08.133
HEY. WHOA. LET HIM GO.

05:08.177 --> 05:09.396
HE DOESN'’T KNOW WHO
MY PARENTS ARE.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.962
I NEVER TOLD HIM.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.966
SHE'’S TELLING
THE TRUTH.

05:17.186 --> 05:18.840
LOOK, MIA,

05:18.883 --> 05:23.323
MIA, MY DAD TOLD ME
TO KEEP A WATCH ON YOU

05:23.366 --> 05:25.237
AND KEEP YOU SAFE,

05:25.281 --> 05:27.979
SO I KNOW WHO
YOUR FATHER IS.

05:28.023 --> 05:30.025
YOUR DAD
KNEW, TOO?

05:30.068 --> 05:31.722
MIA: WHO THE HELL
IS YOUR DAD?

05:31.766 --> 05:34.725
JOHN DIGGLE IS
MY ADOPTIVE FATHER.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.553
-A VIGILANTE.
-MIA--

05:36.597 --> 05:40.035
SO YOU'’VE BEEN
LYING TO ME
THIS ENTIRE TIME?

05:40.078 --> 05:42.254
WELL, NOW THAT WE'’RE
ALL ACQUAINTED,

05:42.298 --> 05:44.474
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING DOWN HERE?

05:44.518 --> 05:46.084
SHE'’S LOOKING
FOR FELICITY,

05:46.128 --> 05:47.912
WHO'’S APPARENTLY NOT DEAD.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.523
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

05:49.566 --> 05:51.394
BECAUSE SHE'’S DONE
THIS BEFORE.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.918
SHE'’S JUST HIDING
SOMEWHERE, BEING
PARANOID LIKE ALWAYS.

05:55.746 --> 05:57.748
MIA: FIGURED IT
MIGHT BE HERE THIS TIME.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.663
DINAH: SO YOU'’RE JUST
GOING ON A HUNCH, HUH?

05:59.707 --> 06:01.709
NO. I AM GOING
ON AN ENTIRE LIFETIME

06:01.752 --> 06:03.275
OF DEALING WITH HER.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.060
DID YOU EVEN BOTHER
CHECKING INTO HER MURDER?

06:05.103 --> 06:06.409
OF COURSE WE DID.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.063
SHE DIED
IN AN EXPLOSION.

06:08.106 --> 06:10.892
DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE A BODY?

06:10.935 --> 06:16.114
WILLIAM: OK.
SO WHERE DO WE START?

06:16.158 --> 06:20.380
YEAH. I'’M NOT LOOKING
FOR ANY KIND OF
FAMILY REUNION HERE, BRO.

06:20.423 --> 06:23.557
OH, I'’M SORRY, SIS,
BUT I HAVE COME TOO FAR

06:23.600 --> 06:26.603
TO GET SIDELINED NOW,
SO WE'’RE HELPING EACH OTHER

06:26.647 --> 06:28.649
WHETHER YOU WANT TO
OR NOT.

06:32.914 --> 06:36.134
THE GHOST INITIATIVE SOUNDS
A LOT LIKE TASK FORCE X.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.789
DIDN'’T LYLA SHELVE
THAT YEARS AGO?

06:38.833 --> 06:40.443
SHE DID,
BUT THERE'’S NOW

06:40.487 --> 06:42.532
A MORE IMMEDIATE,
MORE DANGEROUS TARGET

06:42.576 --> 06:45.405
THAT THE BRASS
AT A.R.G.U.S.,
EVEN ABOVE LYLA,

06:45.448 --> 06:47.450
IS PREVENTING US
FROM PURSUING.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.147
WE'’RE USING
THE GHOST INITIATIVE

06:49.191 --> 06:50.758
TO GO AFTER
THIS TARGET

06:50.801 --> 06:52.586
WITHOUT THEIR
OVERSIGHT.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.239
WELL, I LOVE
A SPONTANEOUS OTA MOMENT

06:54.283 --> 06:55.937
AS MUCH
AS THE NEXT PERSON,

06:55.980 --> 06:58.156
BUT YOU DIDN'’T REALLY
COME HERE TO TELL US

06:58.200 --> 07:00.724
ABOUT RESURRECTING
AN OLD A.R.G.U.S.
DEFUNCT PROGRAM, DID YOU?

07:00.768 --> 07:02.770
IT'’S NOT
ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

07:02.813 --> 07:05.729
IT'’S ABOUT
WHO'’S IN IT.

07:05.773 --> 07:08.297
-RICARDO DIAZ.
-OHH.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.951
YOU HAVE TO BE JOKING.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.779
YOU'’RE WORKING WITH THE MAN
WHO THREATENED

07:11.822 --> 07:14.172
AND TRIED TO KILL
MY ENTIRE FAMILY?

07:14.216 --> 07:16.348
I THINK IT'’S IMPORTANT
THAT WE HEAR WHAT
JOHN HAS TO SAY.

07:16.392 --> 07:20.004
WORKING WITH THIS MONSTER
IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

07:20.048 --> 07:22.964
FOR BRINGING DOWN
A MUCH LARGER THREAT.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.619
DIAZ WAS THE ONLY ONE
WE COULD USE TO GET
CLOSE TO THIS GUY,

07:25.662 --> 07:28.491
AND I PROMISE YOU
HE IS A MILLION
TIMES WORSE.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.972
SO DIAZ IS JUST WALKING
AROUND FREE RIGHT NOW
IN EXCHANGE FOR INTEL?

07:31.015 --> 07:34.192
HE'’S NOT FREE, FELICITY.
HE HAS A BOMB IN HIS HEAD.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.716
IF HE MAKES ONE MISSTEP...

07:38.414 --> 07:40.024
WE ARE TAKING
EVERY PRECAUTION.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.852
WELL, I UNDERSTAND
WHY CURTIS LEFT.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.201
HEY.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.377
YOU CAN'’T REALLY BE
OK WITH THIS.

07:45.421 --> 07:48.990
NO, BUT I--I TRUST JOHN,

07:49.033 --> 07:51.775
AND I BELIEVE

07:51.819 --> 07:54.169
THAT HE WOULD ONLY TAKE
A STEP LIKE THIS

07:54.212 --> 07:56.214
IF HE HAD
NO OTHER CHOICE.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.955
THERE WAS
NO OTHER CHOICE,

07:57.999 --> 08:00.392
AND I HATE THAT
IT CAME TO THIS,

08:00.436 --> 08:02.394
BUT LYLA AND I
BELIEVE THAT USING

08:02.438 --> 08:05.136
THE GHOST INITIATIVE IS
THE BEST WAY TO TAKE
DOWN THIS THREAT.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.399
YOU REALIZE THAT THIS IS
THE SECOND TIME YOU HAVE

08:07.443 --> 08:09.967
PRIORITIZED YOUR JOB
OVER KEEPING
YOUR FRIENDS SAFE?

08:10.011 --> 08:12.056
WORKING WITH A.R.G.U.S.
DOES KEEP YOU SAFE

08:12.100 --> 08:14.537
BECAUSE IT MAKES
THE WORLD SAFE.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.278
YOU CAN KEEP TELLING
YOURSELF THAT.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.557
LYLA: MEET VIRGIL,
AN INTERMEDIARY

08:34.601 --> 08:36.385
FOR THE TERRORIST
FINANCIER KNOWN
AS DANTE.

08:36.428 --> 08:39.083
-DIAZ SHOULD BE FAMILIAR.
-NICE GUY.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.782
JOHN: YOUR JOB IS TO MEET
WITH VIRGIL,

08:41.825 --> 08:44.219
CONVINCE HIM THAT HE SHOULD
BE IN BUSINESS WITH YOU.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.874
YOU GET THROUGH VIRGIL,
YOU GET A MEETING
WITH DANTE.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.615
SO OUR FIRST MISSION
IS A MEETING?

08:48.658 --> 08:50.573
THAT IS WAY
BELOW OUR PAY GRADE.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.836
WAIT. WE'’RE GETTING PAID?

08:52.880 --> 08:55.012
IF WE CAN EVEN
GET THE MEETING.

08:55.056 --> 08:57.319
I TRIED ONCE.
VIRGIL WOULDN'’T
TAKE MY CALL.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.842
JOHN: HE WOULDN'’T
TAKE YOURS,

08:58.886 --> 09:00.496
BUT HE'’LL TAKE HIS.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.498
DIAZ IS THE REASON
WE'’VE BEEN ABLE
TO TRACK VIRGIL.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.805
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, DIAZ?

09:04.848 --> 09:06.763
YOU WANT TO MAKE THAT CALL
FOR REAL THIS TIME?

09:06.807 --> 09:09.244
I THOUGHT YOU'’D
NEVER ASK.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.161
OK. OPERATION
BLOW THE HEAD
OFF THE DRAGON

09:13.204 --> 09:14.945
IS OFFICIALLY
A GO.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.512
I OVERRODE

OR PATTERNS.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.446
OK. WELL, IF DIAZ
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH,

19:46.489 --> 19:48.448
THEN VIRGIL MUST HAVE
BEEN TIPPED OFF
BY SOMEONE ELSE.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.624
PROBABLY THE SAME
SOMEONE WHO'’S BEEN
BLOCKING US IN A.R.G.U.S.,

19:50.667 --> 19:52.234
AND NOW THEY KNOW
WE'’RE USING
THE GHOST INITIATIVE

19:52.278 --> 19:54.802
TO GO AFTER DANTE.

19:54.845 --> 19:58.284
WE NEED TO CATCH HIM
BEFORE THEY SHUT
US DOWN COMPLETELY.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.764
ANY LUCK FIGURING OUT
HIS NEXT MOVE?

20:00.808 --> 20:02.636
WELL, WE DID MANAGE
TO FIND THIS.

20:02.679 --> 20:05.595
IT'’S AN ITALIAN
FLORIN COIN
CIRCA 1300S.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.510
WOULDN'’T HAVE PEGGED
VIRGIL AS A COIN COLLECTOR.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.904
HE WASN'’T.
IT'’S A FAKE.

20:09.947 --> 20:13.037
TURNS OUT THERE'’S
A MICROCHIP
HIDDEN INSIDE.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.822
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
PROMISING.

20:14.865 --> 20:17.520
UNFORTUNATELY, THE DATA'’S
VERY HEAVILY ENCRYPTED.

20:17.564 --> 20:20.262
I DON'’T REALLY
TRUST GIVING IT TO
AN A.R.G.U.S. ANALYST,

20:20.306 --> 20:23.178
BUT CURTIS DID LEAVE
US HIS DECRYPTION
ALGORITHM.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.701
CONSIDERATE OF HIM.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.268
IT'’S GONNA TAKE
A WHILE.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.270
WELL, HOPEFULLY,
NOT TOO LONG.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.620
IF DANTE'’S IN TOWN, IT MUST
BE FOR SOMETHING BIG.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.059
UM, THE ALGORITHM
YOU WROTE TO FIND
THE WEAPON

20:35.103 --> 20:36.844
IS LAGGING
A LITTLE BIT.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.889
DO YOU...MIND
IF I TAKE A LOOK?

20:38.933 --> 20:41.327
THE ALGORITHM'’S FINE.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.850
OK.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.767
DO YOU HAVE TO
STAND RIGHT THERE?

20:50.945 --> 20:53.252
RENE: HEY. SORRY I'’M LATE.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.775
I HAD TO HELP ZOE
WITH HER TEST.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.951
GEOMETRY'’S A BITCH.

20:56.994 --> 20:59.519
-HOW WE LOOKING?
-FANTASTIC.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.477
THE WEIGHT ON THESE
FEELS A LITTLE STRANGE.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.436
DID YOU MAKE THESE
YOURSELF OR--

21:03.479 --> 21:05.351
-NO.
-I'’M JUST ASKING BECAUSE

21:05.394 --> 21:07.135
WHEN I STARTED OUT,
I MADE MOST
OF MY OWN ARROWS,

21:07.178 --> 21:10.051
AND I COULD SHOW YOU
A TRICK OR TWO
IF YOU WANT.

21:10.094 --> 21:14.316
WHAT I WANT IS FOR YOU
TO NOT TOUCH MY THINGS.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.622
[COMPUTER CHIMES]

21:15.665 --> 21:18.668

21:21.018 --> 21:23.325
IN PROMETHIUM-BASED
CUSTOMIZED WEAPONRY.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.892
THAT SOUNDS LIKE OUR GUY.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.502
YEAH. NOW WE JUST
HAVE TO FIND HIM.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.330
ACCORDING TO THAT

RIGHT THERE,

21:28.374 --> 21:30.071
HE'’S DOING A DEAL
TONIGHT

21:30.114 --> 21:32.160
AT AN INDUSTRIAL PLANT
IN PENNYTOWN.

21:32.203 --> 21:33.988
-HMM.
-SO WHAT'’S THE PLAN?

21:34.031 --> 21:35.598
RENE'’S GONNA ROLL WITH ME,
AND YOU NEED TO STAY HERE.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.121
NO WAY. I'’M NOT
STAYING BEHIND.

21:37.165 --> 21:38.906
YOU DON'’T HAVE
A BADGE, OK?

21:38.949 --> 21:42.126
I'’M SORRY,
BUT I PROMISE YOU

21:42.170 --> 21:44.651
WE WILL TAKE CARE
OF THIS.

21:44.694 --> 21:46.261
LET'’S GO, RENE.

21:59.405 --> 22:02.364
GENTLEMEN, WHO'’S READY
TO DO SOME BUSINESS?

22:04.845 --> 22:07.674

I'’LL HANDLE THORNTON!

22:20.469 --> 22:21.905
COPY THAT.

22:21.949 --> 22:24.038
UGH!

22:24.081 --> 22:25.518
THORNTON'’S MINE.

22:33.613 --> 22:35.571
RENE: HEY! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

22:35.615 --> 22:37.094
TAKING BACK MY MISSION!

22:49.890 --> 22:51.370
THERE'’S TWO OF YOU NOW?!

22:51.413 --> 22:52.980
YOU'’RE GONNA TELL ME
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW

22:53.023 --> 22:54.547
ABOUT THE MURDER
OF KAZUMI ADACHI!

22:54.590 --> 22:57.027
ANDREW THORNTON,
UP AGAINST THE WALL!

22:57.071 --> 22:59.334
BY THE AUTHORITY
OF THE SCPD, I AM
PLACING YOU UNDER ARREST.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.075
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

23:01.118 --> 23:03.251
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

23:03.294 --> 23:05.296
I'’M TAKING HIM IN
FOR QUESTIONING.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.081
NO. THIS IS MY MISSION.
I NEED TO QUESTION HIM
MY WAY!

23:07.124 --> 23:08.430
YOU'’D BE BREAKING THE LAW,

23:08.474 --> 23:10.084
WHICH YOU'’RE
ALREADY DOING!

23:10.127 --> 23:13.261
THERE'’S A RIGHT WAY
AND A WRONG WAY TO DO THIS.

23:13.304 --> 23:14.871
THE ONLY THING
I'’VE DONE WRONG

23:14.915 --> 23:16.743
IS THINK THAT I COULD
EVER TRUST YOU.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.756
[GROANS]

23:32.498 --> 23:34.935
HEY. THORNTON'’S READY
TO BE QUESTIONED.

23:36.850 --> 23:39.461
THOUGHT YOU'’D BE
HAPPIER ABOUT THAT.

23:39.505 --> 23:42.290
YEAH. SORRY. I JUST--
WITH EMIKO.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.727
I NEED TO MAKE HER
UNDERSTAND WE'’RE
ON THE SAME SIDE.

23:46.686 --> 23:51.038
I THINK THE PROBLEM
IS YOU THINKING

23:51.081 --> 23:52.735
YOU CAN MAKE
HER DO ANYTHING.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.868
YEAH. I'’VE BEEN DOING
THIS A LONG TIME.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.870
SHE'’S NEW,
SHE'’S UNSANCTIONED,

23:56.913 --> 23:59.046
AND I'’M TRYING TO
HELP HER.

23:59.089 --> 24:00.743
BUT SHE DIDN'’T ASK
FOR YOUR HELP.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.353
IMAGINE HOW YOU
WOULD FEEL

24:02.397 --> 24:04.268
IF, WHEN YOU FIRST
STARTED YOUR QUEST,

24:04.312 --> 24:05.922
SOMEONE HAD
BASICALLY RIPPED
YOUR FATHER'’S LIST

24:05.966 --> 24:08.055
OUT OF YOUR HAND
AND TAKEN OVER
YOUR MISSION.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.100
[SIGHS]

24:10.144 --> 24:12.015
I SEE YOUR POINT.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.539
EMIKO DOESN'’T NEED
ANYBODY TELLING HER

24:13.582 --> 24:15.366
WHAT TO DO
OR HOW TO DO IT,

24:15.410 --> 24:17.847
AND SHE DEFINITELY
DOESN'’T NEED
ANYONE'’S PROTECTION.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.501
YOU SEE THAT MOVE
SHE DID WITH THE BOW

24:19.545 --> 24:21.372
AND SWITCHED HANDS?

24:21.416 --> 24:22.548
YEAH. IT'’S IMPRESSIVE.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.724
RIDICULOUS.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.553
JUST BE HER BROTHER

24:27.596 --> 24:29.729
IF YOU WANT HER
TO BE IN YOUR LIFE
AND TO TRUST YOU.

24:29.772 --> 24:32.253
JUST...

24:32.296 --> 24:34.429
JUST BE HER BROTHER.

24:48.356 --> 24:49.705
WILLIAM: HEY!

24:49.749 --> 24:52.621
IT'’S JUST ME--
YOUR BROTHER, APPARENTLY.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.275
WHAT, YOU THINK
JUST BECAUSE
WE'’RE RELATED

24:54.318 --> 24:55.755
I'’M NOT GONNA KICK
YOUR ASS OUT OF HERE?

24:55.798 --> 24:57.539
THAT WAS THE HOPE, YEAH.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.149
IF YOU'’RE HERE TO
CONVINCE ME TO JOIN

24:59.193 --> 25:00.586
YOUR LITTLE MERRY
BAND OF HEROES,

25:00.629 --> 25:01.978
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

25:02.022 --> 25:03.502
ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST
HOPING THAT WE COULD

25:03.545 --> 25:05.591
COMMISERATE ABOUT HOW MUCH
OUR PARENTS SUCK.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.331
I NEVER HAD ANYONE TO DO
THAT WITH BEFORE.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.638
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST OUR PARENTS?

25:09.682 --> 25:11.161
SEEMS LIKE YOU
CAME OUT ALL RIGHT.

25:11.205 --> 25:12.815
YOU'’RE SUPERRICH.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.251
WELL, LET'’S SEE.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.123
OLIVER, BEING MY DAD,
GOT MY MOM KILLED.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.952
THEN HE AND FELICITY
PROMISED TO STAY
IN MY LIFE

25:18.995 --> 25:20.519
AFTER MY GRANDPARENTS
TOOK CUSTODY,

25:20.562 --> 25:22.303
AND THEN I NEVER HEARD
FROM THEM AGAIN,

25:22.346 --> 25:24.479
AND MY WHOLE JUSTIFICATION
FOR IT, YOU KNOW,

25:24.523 --> 25:28.352
THAT IT'’S HARD
FOR PUBLICLY RECOGNIZED
VIGILANTES TO RAISE CHILDREN,

25:28.396 --> 25:30.180
SORT OF WENT OUT THE WINDOW
WHEN I FOUND OUT

25:30.224 --> 25:33.532
THEY ACTUALLY HAD
ANOTHER KID,

25:33.575 --> 25:37.971
WHICH MEANS THAT THEY
JUST DIDN'’T WANT ME.

25:38.014 --> 25:40.364
BEING THE KID THEY WANTED
WASN'’T SO GREAT EITHER.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.762
IF YOU HATE FELICITY
SO MUCH,

25:46.806 --> 25:50.331
WHY ARE YOU WASTING
ALL THIS TIME TRYING TO
FIND OUT WHERE SHE IS?

25:50.374 --> 25:52.507
-BECAUSE OF THIS.
-A ROCK?

25:52.551 --> 25:54.335
FELICITY GAVE IT TO ME
WHEN I WAS A KID,

25:54.378 --> 25:57.033
AND IT'’S HOW SHE SENT OUT
HER DISTRESS SIGNAL--

25:57.077 --> 25:59.688
NOW NEARLY
TWO DECADES LATER.

25:59.732 --> 26:01.821
AND YOU HELD ONTO IT
ALL THIS TIME.

26:01.864 --> 26:03.344
IT'’S ACTUALLY
REALLY SAD.

26:03.387 --> 26:04.998
THANKS.

26:07.043 --> 26:10.220
YOU KNOW, PARENTS
AREN'’T PERFECT.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.963
THEY LOVE US
THE BEST WAY THEY CAN.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.183
AHH. MAYBE I WAS JUST
TRYING TO DO THE SAME.

26:16.226 --> 26:20.622
MY WHOLE LIFE,
MY MOM TOLD ME THAT
OUR DAD WAS A HERO,

26:20.666 --> 26:24.060
BUT EVERYTHING
IN THIS CITY SAYS
THE OPPOSITE,

26:24.104 --> 26:27.542
THAT ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS
TODAY ARE BECAUSE OF HIM

26:27.586 --> 26:29.457
AND THE OTHER
VIGILANTES.

26:32.329 --> 26:34.288
YOU KNEW HIM
BACK THEN.

26:35.768 --> 26:38.292
WAS HE A HERO?

26:38.335 --> 26:40.120
YEAH, HE REALLY WAS,

26:40.163 --> 26:41.687
AND, YOU KNOW,
I'’M STARTING TO THINK

26:41.730 --> 26:46.213
THAT THIS ROCK WAS
SUPPOSED TO LEAD ME TO YOU.

26:46.256 --> 26:50.304
FAMILY WAS ALWAYS
THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING TO MY--

26:50.347 --> 26:52.132
OUR PARENTS.

26:54.830 --> 26:58.312
DAMN IT, YOU ARE HERE
TO JUST TALK ME
INTO JOINING YOU.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.357
WELL, DID IT WORK?

27:08.365 --> 27:10.324
WE HAVE A LEAD
ON DANTE'’S LOCATION.

27:12.805 --> 27:15.764
-WHAT'’S WRONG?
-I GOT A CALL FROM THE PENTAGON.

27:15.808 --> 27:18.941
THEY WANT ME IN FRONT
OF THE JOINT CHIEFS
TOMORROW.

27:18.985 --> 27:21.596
THEY'’RE GOING TO ASK
FOR MY RESIGNATION.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.729
LYLA, I'’M SO SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER

27:23.772 --> 27:25.600
FORCED YOUR HAND WITH
THE GHOST INITIATIVE.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.428
I BACKED THAT PLAY
WITH OPEN EYES, JOHNNY,

27:27.471 --> 27:29.125
AND I STAND BY IT NOW.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.650
STILL, I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD MEAN YOU
LOSING YOUR JOB.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.130
THEN WE BETTER
MAKE IT COUNT.

27:34.174 --> 27:38.439
DANTE IS WITHIN OUR GRASP,
AND WE MAY NOT HAVE
ANOTHER CHANCE.

27:38.482 --> 27:41.616
NOW TELL ME
ABOUT THAT LEAD.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.185
WELL, CURTIS'’ ALGORITHM
ABSOLUTELY WORKED.

27:45.228 --> 27:47.361
ACCORDING TO THE
MICROCHIP IN THE COIN,

27:47.404 --> 27:50.146
VIRGIL WAS USING IT
AS SOME SORT
OF STORAGE DEVICE

27:50.190 --> 27:51.800
FOR ALL KINDS
OF DATA,

27:51.844 --> 27:53.933
INCLUDING A FORGED
DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIAL

27:53.976 --> 27:55.804
FROM THE QURACI EMBASSY.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.371
THERE'’S A DELEGATION
THERE TONIGHT

27:57.414 --> 27:59.199
WITH A VERY INTERESTING
GUEST OF HONOR--

27:59.242 --> 28:01.027
PRINCESS NOOR HARJAVTI.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.768
RUMOR HAS IT

28:02.811 --> 28:04.813
PRINCESS NOOR IS PLANNING
A REVOLUTION.

28:04.857 --> 28:08.034
SO SHE NEEDS DANTE'’S
MONEY TO FUND
HER PALACE COUP,

28:08.077 --> 28:09.992
WHICH MAY BE
THE REASON WHY
HE'’S IN TOWN--

28:10.036 --> 28:11.559
TO MAKE
THE DEAL.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.779
WE NEED TO GET
INTO THE EMBASSY

28:13.822 --> 28:15.650
AND STOP THAT DEAL FROM
HAPPENING AND NAB DANTE.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.173
COPY THAT.
ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.653
WE HAVE NO IDEA
HOW DANTE LOOKS.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.568
-WE KNOW SOMEBODY WHO DOES.
-DIAZ.

28:22.439 --> 28:24.528
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO PUT
HIM BACK IN THE FIELD.

28:24.572 --> 28:26.792
THAT'’S NOT OUR
BIGGEST PROBLEM.

28:26.835 --> 28:29.011
THE GHOST INITIATIVE
IS BLOWN,

28:29.055 --> 28:30.796
AND WE CAN'’T RELY
ON ANYONE AT A.R.G.U.S.,

28:30.839 --> 28:32.798
AND WE CANNOT
GO IN THERE
WITHOUT BACKUP.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.538
MAYBE WE DON'’T HAVE TO.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.718
OLIVER: JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE WITH JOHN.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.328
HE AND LYLA ARE
GEARING UP

28:41.371 --> 28:42.982
FOR A GHOST INITIATIVE OP.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.505
THEY ASKED ME TO BE
IN THE FIELD.

28:44.548 --> 28:47.203
IN THE FIELD
WITH WHOM EXACTLY?

28:47.247 --> 28:49.205
DIAZ?

28:49.249 --> 28:50.729
I TOLD JOHN IT WAS
YOUR DECISION.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.427
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE
AFTER THE MISSION,

28:53.470 --> 28:56.560
I WILL BACK ANY MOVE
THAT YOU WANT TO
MAKE AGAINST DIAZ.

28:56.604 --> 28:59.085
OH, YOU DON'’T
MEAN THAT.

28:59.128 --> 29:01.043
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:01.087 --> 29:04.220
I KNOW WHY YOU'’VE
BEEN ACTING SO STRANGE
LATELY, RIGHT?

29:04.264 --> 29:06.570
-YOU DO?
-YEAH.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.442
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.922
THERE'’S JUST BEEN
SO MUCH GOING ON. I--

29:09.965 --> 29:11.271
YOU'’RE PLANNING
TO KILL DIAZ.

29:14.317 --> 29:18.234
YEAH. UH, SO I'’M
GUESSING THERE IS
A SPEECH COMING.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.367
FELICITY, I THINK
THERE'’S A BETTER WAY.

29:20.410 --> 29:23.065
I--I THINK THAT,
BUT THAT'’S MY CHOICE.

29:27.940 --> 29:31.857
I HAVE NO RIGHT
WHATSOEVER
TO MAKE YOURS.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.859
RIGHT AFTER I GOT
OUT OF SLABSIDE,

29:33.902 --> 29:38.733
I--I DIDN'’T REALIZE
OR TOTALLY UNDERSTAND

29:38.777 --> 29:42.258
THE--THE PAIN THAT
YOU WERE DEALING WITH.

29:42.302 --> 29:45.087
I JUST WANT YOU
TO GET CLOSURE

29:45.131 --> 29:47.655
BECAUSE I WANT US
TO BE ABLE TO
MOVE FORWARD.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.575
