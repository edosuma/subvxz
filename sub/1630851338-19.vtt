WEBVTT

00:02.736 --> 00:04.703
(tense music)

00:53.654 --> 00:55.286
(thudding)

00:55.990 --> 00:58.857
- Hello? Is anyone there?

00:59.626 --> 01:01.493
(thudding)

01:03.630 --> 01:05.497
Someone home?

01:05.533 --> 01:07.065
What's this?

01:12.373 --> 01:14.272
(screaming)

01:16.177 --> 01:17.776
(crying)

01:18.779 --> 01:20.045
- The bullet entered
her shoulder,

01:20.047 --> 01:21.379
But it did not exit.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.715
I imagine it is lodged
somewhere in her chest.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.117
- No other injuries?

01:25.252 --> 01:27.252
- Not that I can see, no.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.521
Seems the bullet wound
is what killed her;

01:29.557 --> 01:32.123
Arterial bleeding perhaps
filling the lungs.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.058
Of course, I will do
a full postmortem.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.861
(vera sobbing)

01:37.264 --> 01:39.798
- As soon as you can,
please, mrs. Hart.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.066
- Gentlemen?

01:42.570 --> 01:44.135
- Mm. Bit of a mess.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.538
Possible indication
of a robbery?

01:46.540 --> 01:49.073
- Perhaps she interrupted
the intruder,

01:49.110 --> 01:50.876
He panicked, fired?

01:50.945 --> 01:52.944
- All for a bit of silver.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.149
- Oh, I beg your pardon.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.551
Terribly sorry for your loss.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.486
May I please speak
with your daughter?

02:01.522 --> 02:02.820
- What? Now?

02:02.857 --> 02:04.756
- I promise I'll be brief.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.233
Terribly sorry for your loss,
miss chambers.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.835
I'm detective murdoch.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.603
Can you tell me
what happened?

02:21.008 --> 02:23.642
- I was out to dinner
with albert.

02:23.711 --> 02:27.345
And when I got home
that's when I found opal...

02:28.282 --> 02:29.714
Just lying there.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.115
- Albert?

02:31.718 --> 02:33.051
- A...

02:33.087 --> 02:34.719
Gentleman friend.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.790
- Was there anyone else home
when you returned?

02:38.859 --> 02:40.125
- No one.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.595
My brother, eugene,
came in shortly after me.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.564
- Opal wasn't even supposed
to be home.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.202
She was supposed to meet
with her best friend, henrietta.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.870
- And she had cancelled
this date?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.771
- I haven't any idea
what happened.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.007
- Where were they meant to be?

02:56.076 --> 02:58.409
- They were going
to the moving pictures.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.479
She was so looking
forward to it.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.615
- Isn't that quite enough,
detective?

03:04.585 --> 03:06.218
- I just have a few
more questions.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.252
- No, there's no need.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.088
I know who killed my opal.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.390
- You do?
- Of course.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.125
- Who?

03:18.432 --> 03:20.031
(tense music)

03:20.100 --> 03:21.767
(indistinct chattering)

03:22.770 --> 03:24.068
- One of those vagrants
out there.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.380
We haven't had a peaceful night.

03:35.515 --> 03:36.782
- Just last week,
our neighbour's home

03:36.917 --> 03:38.450
Was broken into by a vagrant.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.384
Jewelry was stolen.

03:39.519 --> 03:41.686
- I trust they called
the police?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.588
- Of course. They did nothing.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.524
- I'm sure they looked
into it thoroughly.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.693
- "looked into it."
some help that is.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.694
- These are dangerous men,
detective.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.529
They come in on trains,
cause trouble.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.031
They are no good, none of them.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.933
The-the back door's
been broken into,

03:55.068 --> 03:56.068
Have a look for yourself.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.103
It is obvious one
of them did it.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.739
- And have you yourselves
had cause to interact

04:00.808 --> 04:01.739
With any of them?

04:03.210 --> 04:04.342
- Only opal.

04:04.378 --> 04:07.111
- She was a bleeding heart
for the less fortunate.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.514
She'd volunteer her time...

04:09.516 --> 04:11.116
Feed them...

04:11.251 --> 04:13.151
One of them must have...

04:14.054 --> 04:15.320
I told her it was
a bad idea!

04:15.322 --> 04:16.688
- Mother, sit.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.156
(sobbing)

04:23.030 --> 04:25.096
- Do you know if anything
was taken?

04:25.132 --> 04:26.664
- Uh, not that I'm aware.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.533
- There was this,
on the sideboard.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.002
It's obviously not
one of ours.

04:32.506 --> 04:35.741
- Right. If I could ask
that none of you touch anything.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.442
Our constables will be
taking fingermarks.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.310
- One of the frames is gone.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.780
The one that held the photo
we took on our trip

04:41.849 --> 04:42.714
To niagara falls.

04:42.849 --> 04:43.882
- Oh, no.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.184
I adored that frame.
It was a gift.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.985
It was real sterling silver.

04:48.022 --> 04:49.387
- Anything else?

04:49.423 --> 04:51.590
- Well, uh, we'll have
to look more thoroughly.

04:51.725 --> 04:54.793
- They killed our daughter
for a picture frame.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.796
(sobbing)

04:58.832 --> 05:00.132
- You best take care of this,
detective,

05:00.267 --> 05:02.033
Before another
decent person is hurt.

05:02.102 --> 05:06.170
- And living in the park
makes these people indecent?

05:07.174 --> 05:09.808
- No. It makes them
indolent wastrels.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.948
(birds chirping)

05:19.019 --> 05:21.820
- I know these probably
won't be up to your standards,

05:21.822 --> 05:23.155
But I hope you like them.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.157
- Oh! I'm sure
they're wonderful.

05:28.428 --> 05:29.828
So...

05:29.830 --> 05:32.030
What do you want
to talk to me about?

05:32.799 --> 05:35.033
- Oh! How are you faring?

05:35.102 --> 05:37.635
- Fine. Why do you ask?

05:38.405 --> 05:40.171
- No reason. Ah...

05:40.974 --> 05:42.841
The seasons are changing.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.843
It can lower
one's spirits.

05:44.912 --> 05:45.977
- Yes.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.913
- I-I know for myself,

05:48.949 --> 05:50.282
In times of unrest,

05:50.284 --> 05:52.884
There's nothing worse
than staying home alone.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.854
- Oh, well I don't...

05:55.989 --> 05:59.724
I have plenty of social
engagements on offer,

05:59.793 --> 06:01.593
Should I choose to attend them.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.062
- And have you been
choosing to attend them?

06:06.533 --> 06:09.133
I didn't ask you here

06:09.169 --> 06:12.604
To talk about social calendars.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.072
I have a proposal for you.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.273
- Oh?

06:15.309 --> 06:17.876
- Well, a favour of sorts.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.977
As you know, I work
at the dispensary,

06:20.013 --> 06:22.013
A medical clinic for women.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.815
And, well, in my condition,

06:23.851 --> 06:26.885
I simply can't work the hours
I used to,

06:26.954 --> 06:30.087
And so, well,
the long and the short of it

06:30.124 --> 06:31.223
Is I need help.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.760
- You want me to help
you at a clinic?

06:36.830 --> 06:38.430
- Nothing you wouldn't know
how to do.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.766
Organizing files,
helping with new mothers,

06:41.835 --> 06:43.701
Women who are with child.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.003
You do have expertise
in those areas.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.640
- I suppose I do.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.543
- It-it would be a volunteer
position, of course.

06:51.678 --> 06:54.011
You can work as little
or as much as you'd like.

06:54.782 --> 06:55.913
What do you think?

06:58.519 --> 06:59.551
- Well...

07:00.921 --> 07:02.420
Yes.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.589
Yes, I think
I'd like that.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.024
- Oh, good! That's wonderful.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.528
(phone ringing tone)

07:20.874 --> 07:22.006
- Nobody home?

07:22.042 --> 07:24.008
- Uh, apparently not.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.745
- Problem?
- No, just having trouble

07:26.880 --> 07:27.879
Reaching a friend.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.682
- Maybe your friend
doesn't want to be reached.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.684
- I considered this.
But, firstly,

07:32.753 --> 07:35.287
Nothing seems to have
precipitated such a change

07:35.289 --> 07:37.756
In attitude, and secondly,

07:37.758 --> 07:40.091
One cannot tell
who is telephoning

07:40.093 --> 07:42.227
When one's telephone rings.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.762
- I'm sorry I asked.
- Then again,

07:43.764 --> 07:45.964
Perhaps he's chosen
to relieve himself

07:45.966 --> 07:49.768
Of the burden
of his telephone altogether.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.769
- Sir!

07:52.839 --> 07:54.506
I've spoken to the next-door
neighbour.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.641
Ah, she witnessed a vagrant
going door-to-door

07:56.710 --> 07:57.776
At around 8 p.M.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.010
- Right then.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.778
Let's have a sketch of this man
made up straight away.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.647
- Uh, she didn't get a good
look at him, sir.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.782
- Vagrant, was it?

08:03.917 --> 08:05.116
- There seems to be
an encampment

08:05.152 --> 08:06.251
Near the chambers home.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.586
It's been giving
the neighbourhood

08:07.721 --> 08:08.920
Some trouble of late.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.356
- That place has been a thorn
in the city's side for months.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.758
Let's pay them a visit.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.064
(indistinct chattering)

08:24.137 --> 08:27.338
- Good day. Detective murdoch,
toronto constabulary.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.207
I wonder if you could
answer some que--

08:32.012 --> 08:34.279
- I beg your pardon.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.147
I'm detective llewelyn watts.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.083
- I didn't do nothing.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.352
- I'd just like to ask
you a few questions.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.954
- ...Could answer a few--
- I got nothing to say.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.827
- Goodness.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.564
Oh! Hello.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.369
Not exactly forthcoming.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.570
- These type of people
don't care for the law.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.573
- Can I help you fellows?
You lost?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.309
- No. We're police.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.844
- What do you want?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.613
- Detective murdoch.
We're looking for someone

09:08.682 --> 09:12.250
Who visited a home last night,
just over there.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.285
- Why?

09:14.354 --> 09:16.187
- It was the scene of a murder.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.255
- A murder?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.057
That's a hell of a thing.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.791
And since we're down
on our luck,

09:20.827 --> 09:22.727
One of us must've done it,
is that right?

09:22.796 --> 09:24.529
- What's your name?

09:24.598 --> 09:25.863
- Hank herman.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.666
I'm sort of in charge
around here.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.000
- Oh, is that right?

09:29.002 --> 09:31.402
So, you can make these people
talk to us, can you?

09:32.539 --> 09:34.205
- No one around here
is talking to any coppers.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.475
- We believe the killer
may have stolen some items

09:37.544 --> 09:39.477
From the scene of the crime,

09:39.479 --> 09:42.147
Most notably
a sterling silver frame.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.881
- Don't know anything
about that.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.251
- Do you know of anyone here
in possession of a gun?

09:47.321 --> 09:48.953
- I don't allow guns in here.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.888
- And these people
listen to you, do they?

09:50.924 --> 09:52.624
- Damn right they do.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.027
- We need to toss this place.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.895
Let's get back to the station
and get the lads.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.898
- Well, that will hardly
endear us to the community.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.000
- They're criminals.
They don't need to like us!

10:04.304 --> 10:06.805
- Their only crime we can prove
is being without shelter.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.240
- One of these people has bloody
killed someone, watts.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.976
I'm not going to wait
around until they decide

10:11.111 --> 10:12.310
To turn themselves in.
- Sir.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.312
Woman looks familiar.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.416
- I think she works
at scott's diner,

10:18.418 --> 10:20.651
If I'm not mistaken.
- Think you're right.

10:21.355 --> 10:22.754
Adelaide?

10:22.889 --> 10:24.422
Waitress from the diner?

10:24.491 --> 10:26.124
- Yes. Yes, I am.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.126
- Not been fired, have ya?

10:29.162 --> 10:31.463
- Ah, no.
No, I still work there.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.497
- Ah.
- Every day, actually.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.333
- So, uh...

10:35.402 --> 10:37.735
What are you doing here?
Volunteering, I suppose.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.237
- I, um...

10:41.107 --> 10:42.273
I lost my home.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.842
The diner doesn't pay enough.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.613
But the people here are
quite kind, so it's not so bad.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.783
- We'll search every tent

10:52.819 --> 10:54.185
Until we find
those missing items.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.687
- Are you sure
we want to do that?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.088
- Have you got a better idea,
watts?

10:57.124 --> 10:59.424
- This is like searching
every house in a neighbourhood.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.559
We have no cause to search
any individual

11:01.561 --> 11:02.960
Unless they are under suspicion.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.030
- The killer is a vagrant.
They're all under suspicion.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.164
- Believed to be a vagrant.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.099
- Perhaps the threat
of a widespread search

11:08.101 --> 11:10.301
Will motivate them
to speak with us.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.904
- You agree with this?
- Well, no, watts.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.639
But it's a means to an end.
- Sirs?

11:14.708 --> 11:16.307
Henrietta stiles is here.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.575
She's the friend opal
was going to see

11:17.611 --> 11:18.809
The night of her murder.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.979
- Miss stiles?

11:23.049 --> 11:25.183
You and opal chambers
were good friends?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.584
- Best.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.853
I've known opal my whole life.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.455
She was so kind.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.057
Always willing to help others.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.558
- I'm very sorry for your loss.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.128
- This never would've happened

11:37.164 --> 11:38.797
If she'd just met
with me that night.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.698
- So, you never did
meet up with opal?

11:41.702 --> 11:43.201
- We were supposed
to meet at seven.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.602
Just as I was heading out,

11:44.604 --> 11:46.004
She telephoned and cancelled.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.073
- Did she give you
an explanation?

11:49.142 --> 11:50.141
- No.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.376
- And your whereabouts
that evening

11:51.378 --> 11:52.477
Can be verified?

11:52.479 --> 11:54.111
- Oh, yes, of course.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.480
I was at home
with my grandmother

11:55.482 --> 11:57.215
Finishing my crochet piece.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.617
- Did opal have a paramour?

11:59.753 --> 12:01.352
Was anyone courting her?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.288
- Nobody that I knew of.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.093
- And did you know of anyone
who might wish her harm?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.561
- Never.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.696
Opal was the kindest girl.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.365
I can't imagine anyone
holding a grudge against her.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.102
- But she did frequent
the vagrant encampment, correct?

12:18.105 --> 12:19.470
- Yes.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.072
She used to say
they were good people,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.841
Just a little
down on their luck.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.109
- Did she mention anyone
in particular?

12:25.112 --> 12:27.845
Anyone she felt
might be dangerous?

12:27.981 --> 12:29.513
- Only in good faith.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.116
She was so trusting of them.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.451
Look where it got her.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.220
- Right then, lads.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.856
Let's get in there
and flip every tent

12:37.991 --> 12:39.791
Until we find the missing items.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.792
We're looking for a sterling
silver frame,

12:41.828 --> 12:44.195
Gold-plated comb
and some silver cutlery.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.531
- And if they resist, sir?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.933
- We hold them back
and then we search them.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.267
Let's get to it.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.769
(indistinct shouting)

12:54.341 --> 12:56.808
(grunting)

13:02.716 --> 13:05.216
Constable, go easy
on the young lady.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.355
- What is the meaning of this?

13:10.490 --> 13:11.956
- I've tried to talk
to you already.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.424
We need to find
those missing items

13:13.426 --> 13:14.759
So we know
we're on the right track.

13:14.828 --> 13:15.993
- Please, stop.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.364
I-I know where that frame is.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.499
I know who took it.
- Oh, do you now?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.501
So, who was it?
- I'll show you.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.769
Just call off your men.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.771
- Stand down, lads!

13:26.773 --> 13:27.972
- Stand down!

13:27.974 --> 13:29.374
- So, who am I looking for?

13:29.376 --> 13:30.375
- Eddie stone.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.110
He's known to be violent.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.545
I saw him trying to sell
a sterling silver frame.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.315
His tent's over there.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.849
You'll find him if you're lucky.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.855
- Uh, hang on, sir.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.260
- Niagara falls.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.796
- "to mother with love."

13:51.931 --> 13:53.798
- Sir, this is the frame
we're looking for.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.000
(constable): Hey! Hey! Get him!

13:56.002 --> 13:57.134
- Someone stop him!

13:57.170 --> 13:58.802
- Stop! Stop! Get him!

13:58.839 --> 14:00.304
(grunting)

14:02.208 --> 14:04.275
- We got the guy, eh?

14:04.311 --> 14:05.343
- What do you want from me?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.079
- Seems there are quite
a few things we want from you.

14:08.214 --> 14:09.280
- You leave my things alone!

14:09.415 --> 14:11.749
- Your things? You stole this.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.084
You took it from a murder scene.

14:13.086 --> 14:13.952
- I did not!

14:14.087 --> 14:16.087
- Just look on the bright side,
sunshine.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.621
At least tonight,
you'll be spending the night

14:17.657 --> 14:18.756
With a roof over your head.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.165
- This was found
in your possession.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.567
Now, how did you acquire it?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.869
- How am I supposed to know?

14:32.839 --> 14:34.439
I've never seen it
before in my life.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.375
- You claimed earlier
that these were your things.

14:39.078 --> 14:41.980
Mr. Stone, I believe
you stole this

14:41.982 --> 14:44.082
From the chambers home
just near the camp.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.719
And after stealing it,
you murdered opal chambers.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.587
- I didn't steal anything.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.190
And I definitely
didn't murder anyone.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.459
- All right.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.494
Where were you two nights ago?

14:58.465 --> 14:59.730
- Saturday?

15:02.835 --> 15:04.535
I got in a bar fight.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.737
- What time?

15:05.872 --> 15:07.805
- I don't know. Like, eight?

15:08.541 --> 15:10.074
Nine?

15:10.076 --> 15:12.343
You can ask the copper
who arrested me.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.945
- You were arrested?

15:13.947 --> 15:15.746
- Spent the whole night
in the cells.

15:15.782 --> 15:19.083
- I can confirm this by
telephoning the station house.

15:19.218 --> 15:20.551
- Go ahead.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.153
Then you can strip me down

15:22.155 --> 15:23.721
And I'll show you
my bruised ribs.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.590
It's the only reason I didn't
put up more of a fight.

15:29.996 --> 15:32.763
- It's true.
He was in jail all night.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.366
- So, we have
the wrong person then?

15:35.402 --> 15:37.368
- How did he come by
that stolen frame?

15:37.503 --> 15:39.503
- He says he has no idea
how he got it.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.439
- Perhaps he stole it
from someone else

15:41.574 --> 15:43.240
And doesn't want to admit it?

15:43.242 --> 15:44.909
- Stole it from someone
in that camp.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.377
Someone in there is our killer.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.780
Did you check stone's
fingermarks?

15:48.782 --> 15:50.447
- They aren't a match
for any of the ones

15:50.483 --> 15:52.517
Found in the chambers home.
- What about the glove?

15:52.652 --> 15:55.119
- I haven't been able to link it
to anyone in that camp.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.722
Whoever dropped it likely
disposed of the other one.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.857
- There is another possibility.

15:59.893 --> 16:02.660
Someone may have intentionally
placed that frame

16:02.729 --> 16:03.794
In front of his tent.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.330
- You mean he was set up.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.331
- Well, he's a known criminal.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.167
Easy to convince us someone
like him would be guilty.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.804
- Herman is the one who led us
to mr. Stone.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.572
You should have
another word with him.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.479
(birds chirping)

16:23.383 --> 16:24.916
(indistinct chattering)

16:24.918 --> 16:26.217
- Margaret.
- Oh!

16:26.352 --> 16:28.553
- This is all the paperwork
for today to get through.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.488
- I didn't realize
you were so busy.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.222
- You're going to be
a great help to us.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.058
- You must help me.

16:34.193 --> 16:35.426
(baby crying)

16:35.428 --> 16:36.693
I've been up all night.

16:36.730 --> 16:39.363
She hasn't been feeding
and she won't stop crying!

16:39.366 --> 16:40.765
There must be something wrong.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.433
- All right.
We'll run some tests

16:42.435 --> 16:43.301
And we'll see what's going on.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.669
- She'll be okay, won't she?

16:45.739 --> 16:47.572
- I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about,

16:47.574 --> 16:49.707
And we'll feed her
some formula in the interim.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.520
- Lying to the police
is no small offence.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.122
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.857
- Mr. Stone was in jail
at the time

17:05.992 --> 17:07.458
That that picture frame
was stolen.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.393
- Meaning there's a good chance
that frame

17:09.396 --> 17:11.328
Was placed amongst
his belongings.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.664
- And given that you pointed us
to him,

17:13.733 --> 17:15.199
It's either quite a coincidence,

17:15.268 --> 17:16.667
Or you set it up yourself.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.671
- It's time to tell
the truth, mr. Herman.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.607
- That man is violent.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.476
Rolled in on the rails
a few weeks ago,

17:25.611 --> 17:27.077
Nothing but trouble since.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.213
He attacked a man
just last week,

17:29.215 --> 17:30.614
Nearly killed him!

17:30.650 --> 17:33.351
If you're looking
for a murderer, he's your man.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.819
- So, you presume
him to be guilty

17:34.821 --> 17:36.753
Based solely on his character.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.623
- We are good people here.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.957
Except for him!

17:39.959 --> 17:43.760
- So, you did place that picture
frame in front of his tent?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.297
- I just wanted him gone.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.103
- Where did you get it?

17:52.105 --> 17:53.971
- What?
- The frame!

17:55.041 --> 17:56.240
- A man named reed.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.975
He buys and sells
all sorts of things

17:58.044 --> 17:59.510
Outside that old butcher shop.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.844
- Uh-huh.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.514
So, like a pawn shop?

18:03.649 --> 18:05.850
- Yes, except without the shop.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.719
And when I saw the frame
in his possession,

18:08.755 --> 18:10.287
That's when I got the idea.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.390
- Right.
Well, we'll speak to him.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.925
But, regardless,
you falsified evidence

18:14.994 --> 18:16.527
In a murder investigation.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.462
You're coming with us.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.597
- How long does it take
to toss this place

18:20.633 --> 18:22.400
And arrest somebody for murder?

18:22.535 --> 18:24.301
- Please, let me do my job.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.604
- Well, you're not doing
your job fast enough!

18:26.739 --> 18:28.705
My opal is dead.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.742
And whichever one of these
no-good vagrants did it

18:31.811 --> 18:33.210
Is running around free.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.612
Is this the one who did it?

18:34.614 --> 18:36.214
- He's only a witness.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.950
- How do you know the killer
didn't hop on a freight car
out of town?

18:38.952 --> 18:40.418
- We don't. Mr. Chambers.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.520
The best thing you could do
at this time

18:42.522 --> 18:45.156
Is go home and let us
determine who did it.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.438
- Lads.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.838
Donuts?

19:05.044 --> 19:06.377
Excuse me?

19:06.446 --> 19:08.378
Do you run this place?
- Yeah.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.181
Did someone take
your order already, sir?

19:10.884 --> 19:12.150
- I'm not here to order.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.918
I'm here to discuss
the kind of wages

19:13.987 --> 19:15.819
That you pay your workers
that they can't even afford

19:15.855 --> 19:16.921
A roof over their heads.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.889
- And who said
something like that?

19:19.859 --> 19:21.325
- Never you mind.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.394
- Well, that's not my concern.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.062
I have mouths to feed at home.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.397
- So, you don't care
that the very people you employ

19:27.433 --> 19:29.867
Can't even afford to eat
at the diner that they work at?

19:29.936 --> 19:31.535
- It doesn't matter if I care.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.471
I can't afford to raise
their wages and that's that!

19:39.946 --> 19:41.812
- Mr. Reed, is it?

19:41.948 --> 19:43.480
- Uh, who's asking?

19:43.482 --> 19:45.983
- Detective llewelyn watts
and detective william murdoch

19:46.019 --> 19:48.819
Of the toronto constabulary.
- I-I don't know anything, so--

19:48.888 --> 19:50.521
- I didn't ask you anything.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.690
- Actually, we'd like to know
where you got this.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.827
- Uh. It does look familiar.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.228
Uh...

20:00.233 --> 20:01.899
Um...

20:02.468 --> 20:04.235
Yeah.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.636
Yeah. Yeah, that's mine.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.971
Someone must've stolen it.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.106
- Just tell us where you got it.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.842
- Oh, yes. It was, uh...

20:11.978 --> 20:14.812
Morris graves. I gave him
a pair of boots for it.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.714
(chuckling)
got quite the deal.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.717
- And where might we find
this mr. Graves?

20:19.719 --> 20:21.719
- Uh, usually stays
by the alley,

20:21.721 --> 20:23.920
Uh, behind the grocers
around the way.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.922
- Right.
- Wha...?

20:25.959 --> 20:28.426
Uh, now hold on!
Th-that's my frame.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.494
I traded for it fair and square!

20:35.067 --> 20:36.300
- Mr. Graves?

20:38.638 --> 20:39.870
- Listen,

20:39.939 --> 20:41.472
If this is about
the vegetable stand,

20:41.607 --> 20:43.274
I only took what rolled
onto the street.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.809
- This is about a woman
named opal chambers.

20:45.878 --> 20:46.810
Do you know her?

20:46.846 --> 20:48.112
- No.

20:48.982 --> 20:50.614
- You recognize this?

20:52.685 --> 20:54.151
- No.

20:54.187 --> 20:56.420
- It was stolen
from miss chambers.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.290
And shortly thereafter, it came
to be in your possession.

21:00.326 --> 21:03.026
- I didn't take it.
That woman gave it to me.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.497
- You're telling us that a woman
simply gave this to you.

21:06.566 --> 21:10.267
- Yes. She said it'd be more
useful to me than her.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.369
Nice girl.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.570
- Did she give you
anything else?

21:13.606 --> 21:14.705
- No.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.308
- Where exactly
did she give this to you?

21:17.377 --> 21:18.976
- At her house.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.978
- You were inside of her home?

21:22.015 --> 21:23.380
On the 18th?

21:23.416 --> 21:24.981
- I don't know. I guess.

21:25.018 --> 21:26.917
- How did you come to be
inside her home?

21:30.189 --> 21:32.990
- I went looking for food
and clothing,

21:32.992 --> 21:34.992
Going door-to-door,
like I always do.

21:36.195 --> 21:37.994
That woman just happened
to open the door to me.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.597
- All right. What happened next?

21:41.567 --> 21:43.801
- She gave me the frame
and I left.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.269
- She was still alive
when you left?

21:47.307 --> 21:48.572
- What?

21:49.676 --> 21:51.608
- Miss chambers was murdered.

21:51.644 --> 21:55.145
We believe whoever took this
frame from her is her killer.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.815
- She... She's dead?

22:00.619 --> 22:03.354
Look, I don't know anything
about any murder.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.622
I didn't do anything!

22:05.658 --> 22:07.758
- Let's take him to the camp
and search his things.

22:07.893 --> 22:10.694
- No. No, you guys have
the wrong guy. I didn't--

22:10.763 --> 22:12.830
- Well, then, you have
nothing to worry about.

22:14.233 --> 22:16.567
We found these items

22:16.569 --> 22:19.503
In the tent of a mr. Morris.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.305
Do you recognize any of these?

22:21.374 --> 22:23.307
- I don't know. Mother?

22:23.442 --> 22:25.376
- No. Those are not ours.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.077
(breathing heavily)

22:27.146 --> 22:30.714
- Miss chambers?
- No, I... I...

22:30.717 --> 22:32.849
- I'm sorry, detective.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.585
She's rather overcome
with emotion.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.620
- And, uh, you are?

22:36.756 --> 22:38.656
- Albert jones,

22:38.658 --> 22:39.923
Vera's companion.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.358
- Yes.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.169
- That's her brush.
(vera sobbing)

22:52.304 --> 22:54.037
- It's all right,
it's all right. Come.

22:56.475 --> 22:58.109
- Her hair's still in it.

22:58.244 --> 22:59.476
- Are you quite sure?

23:00.613 --> 23:01.812
- Yes.

23:01.947 --> 23:05.216
Uh, this means it's him.

23:05.351 --> 23:06.983
You-you've found the man
who did it.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.753
- Well, we can't be certain
of that just yet.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.755
- He's the thief,
he's the killer.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.161
I gave this to her
on her 16th birthday.

23:21.367 --> 23:23.366
I should have been there. I...

23:23.403 --> 23:24.701
I should have saved her.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.002
- It's all right, father.
It's all right.

23:29.575 --> 23:30.974
- These cuffs are too tight!

23:31.010 --> 23:32.242
- You'll have them off
in a moment,

23:32.278 --> 23:33.644
Soon as you're in the cells.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.448
- Morris!

23:38.518 --> 23:39.716
- Mr. Chambers?

23:39.752 --> 23:41.819
- If you can't do it, I will.
- No!

23:41.954 --> 23:42.953
(gunshot)

23:43.523 --> 23:44.789
- Hang on!

23:47.526 --> 23:49.260
Someone get a doctor!
(constable): Right, sir!

23:49.395 --> 23:50.927
- What have you done?

23:55.001 --> 23:56.267
- He's dead.

23:56.402 --> 23:57.734
(tense music)

24:11.016 --> 24:12.683
- Why would you do this?

24:13.920 --> 24:16.020
- Can you really say you
wouldn't have done the same?

24:16.155 --> 24:17.688
- I absolutely would not have!

24:17.823 --> 24:20.224
You cannot take the law
into your own hands!

24:20.293 --> 24:22.026
- You have to do right
by your family.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.693
- We were bringing him in!

24:23.729 --> 24:26.830
- You were just going to ask him
a few more useless questions.

24:26.866 --> 24:29.299
- Building a case.
- And then?

24:30.102 --> 24:31.768
What if you couldn't prove it?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.638
(sighing)

24:38.711 --> 24:40.210
Now he's paid.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.113
Now it's over.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.815
- You'll likely hang for this,
mr. Chambers.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.919
- I don't care.

24:55.461 --> 24:56.994
- It will be hard
to convict him.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.796
He'll have the sympathy
of a jury.

24:58.931 --> 25:01.432
- He shot a man in public

25:01.434 --> 25:02.800
With no remorse.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.467
- A man who killed his daughter.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.270
The type of man
that everyone fears.

25:07.673 --> 25:08.739
- Still,

25:08.874 --> 25:11.208
There are questions
that remain unanswered.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.810
- Such as?

25:12.945 --> 25:14.612
- We've found no murder weapon.

25:15.481 --> 25:16.680
- So, he dumped it somewhere.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.750
- No one recalls him
having a gun.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.551
- It hardly changes anything.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.820
Go figure it out
and close the case.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.691
- Your resistance
will not help your case.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.494
- Take your hands off me!
I am not going anywhere.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.696
- Oi, higgins. What's occurring?

25:32.765 --> 25:34.998
- This woman was caught stealing
from a fruit cart, sir.

25:35.668 --> 25:36.534
- Is this true?

25:38.137 --> 25:39.770
- I got fired.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.504
Boss says I was causing trouble.

25:42.642 --> 25:45.275
I had to eat. I-I promise,
I won't do it again.

25:45.311 --> 25:46.910
- Bloody hell.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.245
Take her to my office, higgins,

25:48.314 --> 25:49.913
Give her something to eat,
then let her go.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.181
- Sir.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.716
- Right, you lot, listen up!

25:52.851 --> 25:55.719
As of today, no one
from station house four

25:55.854 --> 25:57.621
Will be seen
entering scott's diner.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.523
- Uh, sir, it's turkey Tuesday.

25:59.658 --> 26:01.592
- No one. Understood?

26:02.194 --> 26:03.193
- Sir.

26:07.132 --> 26:09.466
- I'm afraid your baby
isn't taking the formula.

26:10.536 --> 26:13.070
She's at danger
of becoming malnourished.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.538
- What do I do?

26:15.341 --> 26:16.873
- Well, she has to eat,

26:16.875 --> 26:19.076
So we may need
to feed her forcibly.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.544
(baby cooing)

26:21.814 --> 26:23.414
You haven't held her
in a while.

26:23.549 --> 26:25.148
Would you like to
before we feed her?

26:27.620 --> 26:30.321
- It's fine.
Just, please, help her.

26:39.532 --> 26:42.132
- The bullet pierced his heart,
killing him instantly.

26:43.168 --> 26:44.635
- Thank you, mrs. Hart.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.370
- You're lucky
you weren't injured.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.371
Slip of the hand...

26:49.241 --> 26:50.774
- Yes, I suppose
both watts and I

26:50.843 --> 26:52.643
Have had our share
of close calls.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.212
Anything else?

26:55.214 --> 26:56.846
- Nothing that struck me as odd.

26:56.882 --> 27:00.183
He was fairly healthy,
had all his teeth intact,

27:00.252 --> 27:01.918
A few scratches here and there.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.054
I did notice a red stain
on his shirt.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.989
I thought he had
a pre-existing injury,

27:06.025 --> 27:07.758
But it was just a food stain.

27:07.893 --> 27:09.092
- What kind of food?

27:10.129 --> 27:12.062
- A sauce of some sort?
Maybe a soup.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.463
- Soup?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.201
- If I were to guess,
I'd say tomato.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.504
(tense music)

27:26.879 --> 27:28.879
- A soup stain on mr. Graves

27:28.948 --> 27:30.547
Matching the kind of soup

27:30.583 --> 27:32.216
That was set out
at the chambers home?

27:32.351 --> 27:34.084
- Yes.
- Meaning?

27:34.219 --> 27:37.287
- Meaning he may have had
soup in their home.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.956
- So what?

27:38.958 --> 27:40.356
- It's a bit unusual, sir.

27:40.393 --> 27:43.293
A man robbing a house sits down
to a bowl of soup.

27:43.295 --> 27:46.096
- And he claimed she gave him
the picture frame.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.831
- Along with other items.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.101
So, it's possible
that it is true.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.770
She invited him inside.

27:54.973 --> 27:57.908
- Eating soup is not a tell-tale
sign of innocence.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.711
He could have killed her
and then helped himself.

28:05.117 --> 28:08.385
- His fingermarks
were found here,

28:08.520 --> 28:10.921
As well as on the dining table.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.989
- What about the hallway
where the shot came from?

28:13.025 --> 28:14.391
- Uh, no.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.495
- Is this really necessary?

28:20.533 --> 28:22.665
I've lost my daughter
and now my husband.

28:22.702 --> 28:25.302
Please! I just want peace.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.337
- This won't take long,
I assure you.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.273
- We're very sorry
for your loss.

28:36.348 --> 28:40.583
- The kitchen counter
and then...

28:41.487 --> 28:43.353
Again here on this moulding.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.023
- The front door?

28:47.059 --> 28:50.294
- Fingermarks were found
on the outside doorknob

28:50.429 --> 28:52.095
And the inside doorknob.

28:53.466 --> 28:55.632
- Nothing else?

28:55.701 --> 28:57.000
- No.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.371
- If someone were to break in,

29:01.440 --> 29:04.174
It would be presumably
because the door was locked.

29:04.309 --> 29:06.710
- Hm.
- They would've smashed

29:06.712 --> 29:10.580
The glass, reached inside,

29:10.616 --> 29:13.517
And mr. Graves' fingermarks...
- Should be on the deadbolt.

29:16.489 --> 29:18.722
- They are not?
- They are not.

29:23.729 --> 29:26.196
- He didn't break in,
the window was broken.

29:26.331 --> 29:28.799
- That could also have happened
after the fact.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.734
- So, you think
that she let him in,

29:30.736 --> 29:32.736
Gave him some soup
and then handed him

29:32.871 --> 29:34.605
A pillowcase full of silver
and sent him on his way.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.740
- Well...
- And then somehow she ended up

29:36.742 --> 29:38.742
Being shot and the window
ended up being broken.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.577
How do you explain all that?

29:40.613 --> 29:42.946
- Well, sir, I-I can't, yet.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.349
- You really believe
that someone else killed her?

29:45.351 --> 29:46.617
- Possibly.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.152
- Maybe they have the gun,

29:48.287 --> 29:50.821
Because we still don't even have
a bloody murder weapon.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.695
- Detective?

29:58.764 --> 30:01.698
- I think you'll agree
something is missing.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.767
So, I decided
to revisit our evidence.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.101
- And?

30:05.103 --> 30:07.571
- I had a thought.
About the murder weapon.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.239
- We still haven't found it.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.506
- No.

30:11.377 --> 30:12.909
But we do have this.

30:12.978 --> 30:16.046
- The gun mr. Chambers
used to kill mr. Graves.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.315
- Mr. Chambers' gun.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.518
Ergo, it would have been
inside mr. Chambers' home.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.721
- At the time of opal's murder.
But you don't think...

30:24.857 --> 30:26.723
- The calibre was the same
in both shootings.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.860
Let's imagine,
just for a moment,

30:30.896 --> 30:35.131
That mr. Graves did not
break into the chambers home

30:35.167 --> 30:37.533
And did not commit the murder.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.270
Would it then be possible...

30:40.339 --> 30:42.405
- That the killer
used the same gun.

30:43.776 --> 30:45.943
- I need you to have a look
at the striation marks

30:45.945 --> 30:47.277
On these bullets.

30:48.147 --> 30:49.746
- Uh. Uh-huh.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.548
Yes, it's a match.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.350
Same gun was used
to kill them both.

30:56.589 --> 30:58.422
- The killer is in that house.

31:05.430 --> 31:06.897
Y did it?

31:07.833 --> 31:09.365
- We believe so, yes.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.734
- I still think the vagrant
could have come in the house

31:11.770 --> 31:13.470
And found that gun.
It is possible.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.371
It would've still been
in the house at the time.

31:15.407 --> 31:18.308
- Sir, it was hidden
out of the way in a drawer.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.310
Now, mr. Graves' fingermarks
were found all over

31:20.346 --> 31:23.313
The main floor, but not
on the drawer in question.

31:23.448 --> 31:27.584
Now, it is possible that he
was invited inside, for a time,

31:27.653 --> 31:30.386
But that the murder took place
after he left.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.322
- Whose fingermarks
were on the drawer then?

31:32.457 --> 31:34.958
- It was smudged,
but only family members.

31:35.093 --> 31:38.194
- I was going over the evidence
and noticed something.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.864
What looked to be a pendant
that opal chambers wore

31:41.901 --> 31:44.734
Around her neck
is really a locket.

31:44.770 --> 31:47.737
- What's significant about that?
- Well, lockets usually

31:47.773 --> 31:49.272
Have something inside of them.

31:49.341 --> 31:52.342
This one has the letter
"a" inside of it.

31:52.477 --> 31:53.610
- Hm.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.944
Who does that stand for, then?

31:56.148 --> 31:58.148
- Her father's name is arnold.
- Oof!

31:58.150 --> 31:59.950
- Bloody hell, murdoch,
it's a locket.

32:00.019 --> 32:02.618
- More likely a paramour.
- Thank you, watts.

32:03.822 --> 32:05.555
- Her friend stated
that she wasn't courting anyone.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.957
- Huh.
- Maybe her friend lied.

32:10.028 --> 32:12.028
(indistinct chattering)

32:17.169 --> 32:18.568
- Inspector!

32:18.604 --> 32:20.303
I'm so happy to see you here.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.705
- I'm not here to dine.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.174
I'm just seeing if any of my men
are wasting their money

32:24.309 --> 32:25.575
In this establishment.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.977
- Well, you can rest assured
they haven't.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.446
Since my regulars
stopped coming in,

32:29.448 --> 32:30.781
It's hurt my business
tremendously.

32:30.783 --> 32:32.782
- It's not a nice feeling,
is it?

32:33.785 --> 32:36.186
- I'll hire adelaide back,
all right?

32:36.321 --> 32:38.588
- She shouldn't have been
fired in the first place.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.724
- You're right.

32:40.859 --> 32:42.059
Please.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.795
- My men will return
on one condition.

32:44.930 --> 32:47.397
- What?
- You raise adelaide's wages.

32:48.867 --> 32:49.866
- Agreed.

32:49.868 --> 32:51.601
- And the rest of your staff,
as well.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.737
- I don't think--
- I don't negotiate!

32:53.739 --> 32:55.205
You're not paying
your workers enough

32:55.207 --> 32:57.407
That they can put a decent roof
over their heads.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.941
It's not right.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.645
- It's a deal.
- Good.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.180
And good day to you.

33:06.819 --> 33:09.553
- Miss stiles,
the last time we spoke,

33:09.555 --> 33:11.687
You weren't entirely
honest with me.

33:11.724 --> 33:15.825
- I am a very honest person.
My family can attest to it.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.964
- Who is "a"?

33:22.067 --> 33:23.166
- "a"?

33:24.236 --> 33:25.902
- This belonged
to miss chambers.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.572
- It could be anybody, really.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.107
- Hm.

33:31.043 --> 33:33.844
Well, I guess,
as a best friend,

33:33.846 --> 33:36.246
Miss chambers didn't really
tell you everything.

33:38.216 --> 33:42.119
I know that if I had an enemy,
or a secret lover,

33:42.254 --> 33:45.521
I surely would reveal that
to my closest friend.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.394
- If you really are to know...

33:52.598 --> 33:54.697
The a is for albert.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.333
Yes.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.034
That albert.

33:58.037 --> 33:59.335
Vera's lover.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.873
- Miss chambers was seeing
albert behind her sister's back?

34:03.976 --> 34:06.676
- I swore I wouldn't
tell a soul, but...

34:07.613 --> 34:09.079
She's gone now.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.550
- You were with vera chambers

34:13.552 --> 34:14.951
The night of the murder,
correct?

34:14.953 --> 34:17.554
- Yes. Yes, we were at
parkwood bowling and dining,

34:17.556 --> 34:18.688
On the east side of town.

34:19.792 --> 34:22.625
- Did you visit
anywhere else that night?

34:22.661 --> 34:24.227
- What do you mean?

34:24.229 --> 34:26.429
- Did you meet with anyone else?

34:26.432 --> 34:27.564
- No.

34:28.633 --> 34:29.665
- No?

34:30.435 --> 34:32.068
Not opal chambers?

34:33.705 --> 34:35.438
- Why would I be meeting up
with opal chambers?

34:35.507 --> 34:37.574
That's, uh... It's just silly.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.509
- Perhaps because you were
seeing her.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.511
Behind her sister's back.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.180
- I don't know where
you heard that,

34:44.316 --> 34:46.583
But I can assure
you it's a lie.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.785
- Mr. Jones, we know it's true.

34:56.995 --> 34:58.595
- I was in love with opal.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.532
- So you did see her that night?

35:05.804 --> 35:07.970
- I called opal
earlier in the evening...

35:09.741 --> 35:12.475
Told her to meet me at the park
about 7 p.M.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.878
I wanted to break it off
with her because I just...

35:15.914 --> 35:19.749
I couldn't do this anymore.
I-I love vera.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.418
- You said you loved her sister.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.087
- Well, I love them both. I...

35:26.291 --> 35:28.457
Obviously, I had
to put a stop to it.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.629
- So, instead of meeting
with henrietta that night,

35:32.698 --> 35:35.365
It was you she went to see?

35:36.301 --> 35:37.700
- Yes.

35:39.304 --> 35:42.506
After I broke it to her,
then I went to meet vera.

35:44.442 --> 35:46.075
Opal was so distraught.

35:47.045 --> 35:48.811
She ran home crying. I...

35:49.981 --> 35:51.715
- And you followed her?

35:51.717 --> 35:53.516
- Follow? Why would I...?

35:55.354 --> 35:57.787
If you're suggesting I had
anything to do with her death,

35:57.923 --> 35:59.255
You-you're mistaken.

35:59.391 --> 36:02.459
- Perhaps she threatened
to expose the affair?

36:02.594 --> 36:04.961
You couldn't let that happen.
- No. No, no, no.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.897
She didn't. She was heartbroken,
but I...

36:09.434 --> 36:11.267
I could never hurt opal.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.938
Please, I-I swear to you.
I-I don't know what happened

36:15.974 --> 36:18.674
After opal got home that night,
but I-I wasn't there.

36:21.146 --> 36:23.413
- I know this all seems
quite overwhelming,

36:23.482 --> 36:25.081
But it really will be a quick...

36:26.051 --> 36:28.050
Is she feeding?
- She is, indeed.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.021
- Thank you.
I was losing all hope.

36:34.092 --> 36:36.092
- She's looking
healthier already.

36:36.094 --> 36:38.761
- Hm. Some babies
don't take to the bottle.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.664
They need the human touch.

36:40.666 --> 36:41.965
(baby cooing)

36:42.034 --> 36:44.033
Would you like
to try holding her?

36:44.836 --> 36:46.269
- She cries when I hold her.

36:47.072 --> 36:48.771
I don't know what I'm doing.

36:49.942 --> 36:51.374
- You're her mother.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.443
You're all she needs.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.912
Trust me. You'll be just fine.

36:57.616 --> 36:58.949
Good girl.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.951
These are the days
you'll never forget.

37:03.321 --> 37:04.688
Treasure them.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.699
- Was it the two-timer?

37:16.768 --> 37:19.068
- His alibi suggests
he wouldn't have had time

37:19.137 --> 37:21.271
To follow miss chambers home
and kill her.

37:21.340 --> 37:24.407
They were confirmed attending
parkwood bowling and dining.

37:24.476 --> 37:27.076
- Well, it was someone
in the house.

37:27.112 --> 37:28.811
What about fingermarks
on the gun?

37:29.881 --> 37:31.614
- Mr. Chambers used it
to kill our suspect

37:31.683 --> 37:34.017
Subsequent to the initial
murder.

37:34.152 --> 37:35.685
We only found his fingermarks.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.788
- Maybe we check again?
- No, we were thorough.

37:38.923 --> 37:41.758
Any previous marks were smudged
or wiped off completely.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.562
- We checked the gun
for fingermarks,

37:47.266 --> 37:48.965
But not the bullets.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.305
- Well?

37:57.676 --> 38:00.110
- All of the fingermarks
on these bullets

38:00.245 --> 38:01.778
Are mr. Chambers'.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.115
- No surprise.
Perhaps he's the killer.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.783
- Except for this one.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.585
- Oh? Whose is it?

38:08.720 --> 38:11.288
- Vera chambers. Opal's sister.

38:17.862 --> 38:19.462
- Miss chambers.

38:19.597 --> 38:21.864
We'd like to speak to you
about the murder of your sister,

38:21.933 --> 38:22.999
Opal chambers.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.535
- What's going on?
What are you doing here?

38:27.005 --> 38:29.205
- We found your fingermark

38:29.274 --> 38:31.874
On a bullet casing
in your father's gun,

38:31.910 --> 38:34.677
The same gun that was used
to kill your sister, opal.

38:34.746 --> 38:37.013
- You fired it once,
killing her.

38:37.082 --> 38:40.150
Then put it back
in the hallway table drawer,

38:40.152 --> 38:42.886
But not before replacing
the fired bullet

38:42.888 --> 38:44.754
So no one would be the wiser.

38:44.889 --> 38:46.322
- Lies!

38:46.391 --> 38:48.825
Why are you doing this?
My daughter's innocent.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.293
- Let it be, mother.
- No!

38:50.362 --> 38:52.028
- It was bound to come
back to me eventually.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.163
- Vera! No!
- Mother.

38:54.199 --> 38:55.698
- Th-th-this isn't proof.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.333
Just because
she touched a bullet?

38:58.737 --> 39:00.837
- You believe someone else
fired that gun?

39:00.972 --> 39:03.173
- They must have!
It can't be her.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.043
- I agree.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.379
Miss chambers was seen
in the company of mr. Jones

39:09.448 --> 39:12.048
At the time of the murder,
and she didn't return home

39:12.183 --> 39:14.683
Until at least one hour
after it happened.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.086
- So it was him,
it was the vagrant.

39:17.155 --> 39:18.320
- Yes!

39:18.357 --> 39:19.422
- Possibly.

39:20.658 --> 39:22.859
But I doubt very much
he was able to find

39:22.861 --> 39:24.693
That gun where it was hidden.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.062
Furthermore, I don't believe

39:27.099 --> 39:29.532
Miss chambers
helped him find it.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.034
- Of course she didn't help him.
What are you talking about?

39:33.872 --> 39:36.672
- You didn't fire that gun,
did you, miss chambers?

39:38.276 --> 39:41.544
But you did replace
the one spent bullet.

39:42.814 --> 39:45.148
- You were protecting someone?

39:45.150 --> 39:47.016
- What are you saying?

39:47.085 --> 39:49.819
Who killed my daughter?
- Who are you covering for?

39:49.821 --> 39:52.288
- I-I don't know
what you're talking about!

39:52.424 --> 39:53.757
- Vera?
- I...

39:53.892 --> 39:56.693
- It was me. It was me.
She was covering for me.

40:03.768 --> 40:04.834
- Tell us what happened.

40:09.774 --> 40:11.374
- That night I came home early.

40:13.378 --> 40:15.110
<i> She wasn't supposed</i>
<i> to be at home.</i>

40:16.415 --> 40:17.914
<i> I heard noises.</i>

40:17.916 --> 40:20.650
<i> I thought a vagrant</i>
<i> was robbing us.</i>

40:20.652 --> 40:21.984
<i> I got the gun.</i>

40:23.388 --> 40:25.321
<i> With the neighbours' recent</i>
<i> break-ins, I was frightened.</i>

40:25.457 --> 40:27.123
<i> I was sure! I-I just--</i>

40:28.593 --> 40:30.593
I just wanted to stop him!

40:31.896 --> 40:33.062
(gunshot)

40:33.131 --> 40:34.463
(thudding)

40:37.769 --> 40:39.736
<i> When I finally went over</i>
<i> to the dead body,</i>

40:39.738 --> 40:41.003
<i> I realized it was opal.</i>

40:47.179 --> 40:50.813
<i> I didn't even have time</i>
<i> to think. Until vera arrived.</i>

40:50.816 --> 40:52.515
(screaming)

41:00.558 --> 41:02.258
We tried to make it
look like a break in.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.393
She was just
trying to protect me.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.464
I'm sorry, mother.

41:24.048 --> 41:25.848
(laughing)

41:25.917 --> 41:28.117
- You really do seem
to have the magic touch!

41:28.253 --> 41:29.919
- Ah! It's not magic,

41:29.955 --> 41:32.255
Just experience
and common sense.

41:32.257 --> 41:35.258
- Well, thank you, margaret.
- Mm.

41:35.327 --> 41:37.994
- Poor woman seemed
unable to even hold her baby

41:38.063 --> 41:38.928
Before you helped.

41:40.298 --> 41:41.931
And to think I was about
to perform a rather

41:41.967 --> 41:43.866
Harsh medical procedure.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.302
- Uh, it was my pleasure.

41:48.507 --> 41:50.372
- I have to admit,
I'm rather afraid

41:50.408 --> 41:51.774
Of when this baby comes.

41:52.811 --> 41:56.012
I know how to be a doctor,
not a mother.

41:56.014 --> 41:59.682
- Oh! Well, no one knows
what to do.

41:59.684 --> 42:00.816
You just do it.

42:01.786 --> 42:03.519
- I suppose so.

42:04.823 --> 42:07.690
- Well, if you need any help,
I'll be right here.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.759
- Thank you, margaret.

42:09.894 --> 42:11.293
- Thank you.

42:16.701 --> 42:18.101
(birds chirping)

42:27.946 --> 42:30.446
- Looking for mr. Strange,
are you?

42:30.515 --> 42:33.583
- That's right. I haven't
been able to reach him.

42:33.652 --> 42:35.318
- Took off couple of days ago.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.854
- Took off to where?

42:37.989 --> 42:39.188
- Don't know.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.057
Him and his friend
loaded luggage into a carriage

42:41.059 --> 42:42.392
And took off.

42:42.527 --> 42:44.460
(clearing throat)
- his friend?

42:45.530 --> 42:47.529
- Sure, friend.

42:47.566 --> 42:49.065
Young man.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.733
Younger than yourself.

42:51.736 --> 42:53.069
- Thank you.

42:53.138 --> 42:55.104
(horse hooves pattering)

43:02.280 --> 43:03.680
- Ah, there you are.

43:04.482 --> 43:06.082
All's well that ends well.

43:06.084 --> 43:08.151
- I can't thank you enough.

43:08.286 --> 43:10.720
I may be able to save enough
to get my own place soon.

43:10.855 --> 43:12.755
- It's the least you deserve.
(chuckling)

43:12.824 --> 43:14.490
