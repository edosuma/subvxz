00:01:19.937 --> 00:01:21.226
An axe.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.867
Fucking...

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:23.993
Son of a...

00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:34.912
She's okay? She must
be fine. I trust you.

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:48.578
The Killer: A Girl Who Deserves to Die

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.404
Expert on Real Estate Tax Settlement

00:04:11.145 --> 00:04:12.224
What is it?

00:04:14.972 --> 00:04:16.270
Nothing.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.767
Look in the mirror
and see if it's nothing.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.639
So...

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.597
What's the favor?

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:32.604
Can you look after a kid?

00:04:32.684 --> 00:04:33.563
What kid?

00:04:33.643 --> 00:04:35.731
My friend's kid, the one
I'm going to Jeju with.

00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:37.809
She has no one to look after her.

00:04:38.728 --> 00:04:39.557
How old?

00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:41.225
Seventeen.

00:04:41.685 --> 00:04:42.514
And the husband?

00:04:42.604 --> 00:04:45.431
She's divorced and he's not around.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.478
She lived a tough life as a single mom.

00:04:48.598 --> 00:04:50.346
But the kid's all grown up.

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:52.144
She'll be uncomfortable with me.

00:04:52.224 --> 00:04:54.023
Tell her to stay at home.

00:04:54.102 --> 00:04:58.558
Their home is so old, the roof
leaks, it needs a full renovation.

00:04:59.687 --> 00:05:01.225
How long will it take?

00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:03.313
About 3 weeks?

00:05:03.393 --> 00:05:05.141
I see what's going on here.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.269
Travel for 3 weeks,
renovation for 3 weeks.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.807
She's scheming to leave her kid with me

00:05:09.897 --> 00:05:12.104
while she's away on vacation!

00:05:12.184 --> 00:05:14.602
Anyway, I'll give you
her number and address,

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:17.729
so pick her up after dropping
me off at the airport.

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:20.436
Tell her to use the guest
room on the 2nd floor.

00:05:20.516 --> 00:05:21.565
Wait.

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:24.023
My house?

00:05:24.142 --> 00:05:25.981
Not your house, our house!

00:05:28.438 --> 00:05:31.185
You're going to let a
stranger into my house?

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:32.764
Shut it, that's enough.

00:05:32.854 --> 00:05:36.890
Anyways, she's her precious kid,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.356
so if she's hurt in any way,

00:05:40.976 --> 00:05:42.224
you're dead.

00:05:43.813 --> 00:05:46.270
I never had a choice.

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:48.228
Honey.

00:05:50.806 --> 00:05:52.764
Did you go shooting again?

00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:55.601
Yeah, I went shooting!

00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:56.810
Jeez!

00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:07.979
Be cooperative this time,

00:06:08.978 --> 00:06:11.605
you'll get a free pass
for a few months.

00:06:18.188 --> 00:06:19.767
Doesn't this look nice?

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:22.724
Looks so nice, it's been so long.

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:25.351
- I got a coupon.
- For real?

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.768
Eyes on the road.

00:06:33.723 --> 00:06:35.391
Thank you so much.

00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:36.890
I'll be right there.

00:06:38.978 --> 00:06:40.146
You can do this.

00:06:40.226 --> 00:06:41.565
I'll call you.

00:06:42.224 --> 00:06:43.523
I'm off.

00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:48.648
- Wait for me!
- Let's go, I'm so happy.

00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:07.739
Kim Yoon-ji

00:07:11.935 --> 00:07:13.433
My babysitter?

00:07:13.723 --> 00:07:15.351
Kim Yoon-ji?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.189
Get in.

00:07:19.517 --> 00:07:21.315
Isn't this car expensive?

00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:23.523
Yeah, a bit.

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.727
She's my friend, can she come with?

00:07:29.936 --> 00:07:31.105
Hello.

00:07:31.765 --> 00:07:33.013
I don't see why not.

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:34.602
Where to?

00:07:34.682 --> 00:07:35.771
Hongik University.

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:37.139
I need to buy some books.

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:38.808
Hongik, I see.

00:07:39.557 --> 00:07:41.645
Sure, let's go.

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:51.315
17 years old, puberty, a reckless age.

00:07:51.435 --> 00:07:54.682
Adult physique with a kid's brain.

00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:59.647
An immature human who
can't handle herself yet.

00:08:00.226 --> 00:08:04.352
The reason she scares me is
no one knows what she'll do.

00:08:04.432 --> 00:08:06.730
Sir, can I sleep over at her place?

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.268
That sounds good to me.

00:08:08.348 --> 00:08:10.556
Don't tell my mom.

00:08:11.645 --> 00:08:13.433
She'll get worried.

00:08:13.523 --> 00:08:15.930
Call me if anything happens.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.687
You can stay there a few more days.

00:08:21.815 --> 00:08:24.022
Hongdae Entrance Station

00:08:31.185 --> 00:08:32.684
Give me your wallet.

00:08:33.223 --> 00:08:34.522
That's okay.

00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:36.600
Don't be modest, give it to me.

00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:42.144
Good.

00:08:47.938 --> 00:08:49.597
Emergency money.

00:08:50.646 --> 00:08:53.103
It's polite to buy a gift
when you visit someone,

00:08:53.183 --> 00:08:55.561
so you can stay longer.

00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:58.148
Buy something good to eat,

00:08:58.228 --> 00:08:58.937
got it?

00:08:59.017 --> 00:09:00.016
Thank you!

00:09:01.105 --> 00:09:02.144
Let's go.

00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:08.228
That's a bribe to stay away
from strange places,

00:09:08.308 --> 00:09:10.855
so if you break it, penalty doubles.

00:09:10.935 --> 00:09:12.314
Don't worry.

00:09:12.394 --> 00:09:13.183
Very well.

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:31.485
Punk Kid 5

00:09:38.648 --> 00:09:40.516
Hello?

00:09:40.726 --> 00:09:43.063
Why won't you pick up?

00:09:43.273 --> 00:09:46.600
Because it's past midnight...

00:09:48.098 --> 00:09:48.937
What is it?

00:09:49.017 --> 00:09:50.935
My stomach hurts.

00:09:52.724 --> 00:09:55.231
Then you should go to the hospital.

00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:57.639
Just come get me!

00:09:59.347 --> 00:10:01.355
Fine, where are you?

00:10:31.315 --> 00:10:32.184
Your dad?

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:34.472
Is he out of his mind?

00:10:34.602 --> 00:10:35.681
Uncle.

00:10:38.148 --> 00:10:40.686
Hello, I'm a senior at her school.

00:10:40.805 --> 00:10:42.314
Nice to meet you.

00:10:43.023 --> 00:10:44.722
Yoon-ji, I'll head home now.

00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:46.520
Where do you live again?

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.479
We'll drop you off.

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.057
It's okay, I can take a cab.

00:10:57.479 --> 00:10:58.478
Hey.

00:10:58.598 --> 00:10:59.477
Yes?

00:10:59.597 --> 00:11:00.975
Your stomach?

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:03.772
It doesn't hurt that much.

00:11:04.102 --> 00:11:07.309
Then why did you
cry and wail like that?

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:09.267
I just want to go back to your house.

00:11:09.437 --> 00:11:10.686
Dammit.

00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:14.432
Where's your friend?

00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:18.268
Weren't you sleeping there?
Group project and all.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:24.682
Hey!

00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:27.269
You can go home first.

00:11:33.313 --> 00:11:36.140
You think I'm laughing?
I'm actually crying.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.727
Are you messing with me?

00:11:43.812 --> 00:11:45.231
Can I really leave?

00:11:45.311 --> 00:11:46.480
Sure.

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:48.348
I'm really leaving.

00:11:48.897 --> 00:11:49.846
Okay.

00:11:52.763 --> 00:11:56.270
Fine, have a safe ride home, call me.

00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:58.438
Don't worry.

00:12:02.813 --> 00:12:04.022
Okay.

00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:20.146
Hey, she's here, let's move.

00:12:57.439 --> 00:13:00.316
Honey, the food here
is really delicious.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.064
Are you getting along with her?

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.847
Give me your wallet.

00:13:42.723 --> 00:13:44.432
Think of it as a gig.

00:13:44.522 --> 00:13:46.889
Is it really that hard to help me?

00:13:50.056 --> 00:13:51.684
It's nothing at all.

00:13:52.014 --> 00:13:54.721
Close your eyes for an
hour and boom, $2,000.

00:13:54.811 --> 00:13:56.939
If it's so good, then
why don't you do it?

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:59.187
She's too old to get much.

00:13:59.646 --> 00:14:00.975
I doubt she can even get $200.

00:14:01.065 --> 00:14:03.063
Shut your fucking mouth!

00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:04.561
You're not the one
bringing the customers.

00:14:04.641 --> 00:14:06.310
You only bring cheap ass perverts.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.268
You want to get your ass kicked?

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.477
$2,000 since you're a virgin.

00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:11.065
$500 if you're lucky afterwards.

00:14:11.435 --> 00:14:12.434
Are you even a virgin?

00:14:12.514 --> 00:14:14.811
Who cares if she's a
fucking virgin or not.

00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:16.190
Just tell them you are.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.688
You idiot,

00:14:17.768 --> 00:14:20.106
business is based on trust.

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:22.723
Those perverts only go for virgins.

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:25.391
You don't think they'll notice?

00:14:26.689 --> 00:14:28.977
That's why you're still where you are.

00:14:34.472 --> 00:14:37.229
She's the one who brought you here.

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:42.314
I didn't even ask, but she
told me how to bait you.

00:14:42.643 --> 00:14:44.182
Funny, eh?

00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:47.309
You like him, right?

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.522
I never said that.

00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:55.850
Then why did you agree to come

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.308
when she said he was here?

00:14:58.847 --> 00:15:00.555
Please let us go...

00:15:01.395 --> 00:15:02.933
Shut the fuck up.

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:10.146
I'm sure I don't have
to waste my breath.

00:15:10.356 --> 00:15:11.185
Right?

00:15:11.604 --> 00:15:13.682
Go fuck yourself, bitch.

00:15:13.772 --> 00:15:15.021
You little shit!

00:15:15.391 --> 00:15:16.559
That's enough.

00:15:19.766 --> 00:15:22.064
She's not allowed to get hurt.

00:15:23.273 --> 00:15:24.272
What the hell?

00:15:24.601 --> 00:15:26.440
How the fuck did you find us?

00:15:32.853 --> 00:15:34.392
What are you idiots waiting for?

00:15:37.598 --> 00:15:38.847
You motherfucker!

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.558
Go outside.

00:15:50.186 --> 00:15:51.604
Fucking asshole.

00:16:26.849 --> 00:16:28.098
Sir.

00:16:33.063 --> 00:16:34.222
Sir?

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.439
Sir.

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:41.514
I'm hungry.

00:16:41.764 --> 00:16:43.722
Eat something then.

00:16:53.103 --> 00:16:54.521
How old are you?

00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:57.938
Get some food with what
I gave you yesterday.

00:16:58.517 --> 00:16:59.936
Why don't you have a baby yet?

00:17:00.016 --> 00:17:01.894
We don't want a baby.

00:17:03.602 --> 00:17:05.480
You can't have kids?

00:17:09.726 --> 00:17:11.724
So, how old are you?

00:17:12.224 --> 00:17:13.892
42, happy?

00:17:13.972 --> 00:17:16.349
Dang, you're older than my mom.

00:17:17.478 --> 00:17:20.306
But you look mid-30's.

00:17:21.894 --> 00:17:23.472
She's a good kid.

00:17:23.562 --> 00:17:25.181
Are you an athlete?

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.229
Which sports?

00:17:29.436 --> 00:17:31.604
This and that.

00:17:33.432 --> 00:17:35.271
What do you do for a living?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.689
Why?

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.396
Well, you got this nice
house and the car.

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:41.105
How did you become so rich?

00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:44.471
A friend owns a few buildings,
I just manage them.

00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:46.979
Real estate is the way to go.

00:17:48.018 --> 00:17:50.146
If a manager makes this much...

00:17:53.023 --> 00:17:54.102
Hey.

00:17:54.891 --> 00:17:57.019
What do you plan to do?

00:18:01.015 --> 00:18:02.683
I'm just going to stay here.

00:18:02.773 --> 00:18:03.722
Damn it.

00:18:03.892 --> 00:18:06.020
Don't you have a lot of friends?

00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:07.848
I'm a bit of a loner at school.

00:18:08.148 --> 00:18:09.346
What do you mean?

00:18:09.806 --> 00:18:12.603
Alone? Loner?

00:18:13.183 --> 00:18:15.310
Yeah, a big loner.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.849
Keep moving!

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.517
Please keep moving!

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:36.309
You're blocking traffic, keep moving!

00:18:45.231 --> 00:18:47.478
Please keep moving.

00:18:47.808 --> 00:18:49.017
Hold on.

00:18:57.688 --> 00:18:58.937
Good evening.

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.063
Hello.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.348
Did something happen?

00:19:07.478 --> 00:19:09.187
There was a murder.

00:19:09.856 --> 00:19:11.065
A murder?

00:19:11.394 --> 00:19:14.521
Teenagers got stabbed
in a roller skating rink.

00:19:16.769 --> 00:19:18.397
Kids nowadays.

00:19:20.515 --> 00:19:22.223
So, what can I do for you?

00:19:23.103 --> 00:19:25.270
Do you pass by here often?

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.598
Sometimes, it's a shortcut.

00:19:28.307 --> 00:19:30.305
I see.

00:19:33.103 --> 00:19:35.061
Thanks for your cooperation, take care.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.769
Okay, then.

00:19:51.484 --> 00:19:55.570
"Five bodies of men found
in closed skating rink."

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:01.614
Hye-joo, are you okay?

00:20:08.647 --> 00:20:12.973
Bad gut feeling didn't last a day.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.639
Who is it?

00:20:27.228 --> 00:20:29.057
Cop from yesterday.

00:20:32.353 --> 00:20:33.472
Go upstairs.

00:20:44.102 --> 00:20:45.980
Sorry to bother you again.

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:48.397
Why don't we chat over there?

00:20:49.097 --> 00:20:51.015
Stunning house.

00:20:51.314 --> 00:20:52.893
What brings you here?

00:20:53.772 --> 00:20:55.770
This is just a routine check,

00:20:56.189 --> 00:20:57.848
so no need to be nervous.

00:20:59.146 --> 00:21:01.854
This was 30 minutes
before the incident.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.978
Isn't this your vehicle?

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.765
I wasn't the only one
to drive through there.

00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:14.181
Do you recognize this motorcycle?

00:21:20.265 --> 00:21:22.183
I can't see very well at night.

00:21:22.393 --> 00:21:25.100
It was right in front of
your car, don't remember?

00:21:27.138 --> 00:21:28.267
Detective.

00:21:29.186 --> 00:21:32.973
Do you remember the car
that you passed by just now?

00:21:33.063 --> 00:21:33.682
Sorry?

00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:35.810
Was it a sedan or a motorcycle?

00:21:36.099 --> 00:21:37.728
Maybe it was a delivery bike?

00:21:38.647 --> 00:21:39.976
One sec.

00:21:41.814 --> 00:21:43.102
It was a truck.

00:21:44.681 --> 00:21:46.229
1.5-ton truck.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:52.893
You got me good this time.

00:21:54.681 --> 00:21:58.897
You don't have any children,

00:21:59.436 --> 00:22:01.934
who was the girl with you...

00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:07.019
Did you do a background check on me?

00:22:07.098 --> 00:22:09.266
Well, it is an investigation.

00:22:10.145 --> 00:22:12.683
It's my wife's friend's daughter.

00:22:12.773 --> 00:22:15.480
I'm babysitting her
while she's on vacation.

00:22:17.518 --> 00:22:20.185
Is this Kim Yoon-ji?

00:22:21.264 --> 00:22:22.683
I'm not sure.

00:22:22.813 --> 00:22:25.100
Anyways, she was with me.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.938
Can I speak with her for a bit?

00:22:28.437 --> 00:22:32.353
Come back when you
have proof she's involved.

00:22:32.563 --> 00:22:35.640
She's been bullied badly at school.

00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:38.847
Involved in a few
school violence cases.

00:22:38.937 --> 00:22:41.264
And with one of the dead...

00:22:43.432 --> 00:22:45.640
Hey, Yoon-ji!

00:22:47.098 --> 00:22:49.186
I think you should leave now.

00:22:53.272 --> 00:22:57.398
Sure, I'll be off for now.

00:23:03.722 --> 00:23:05.520
As a precaution,

00:23:07.058 --> 00:23:09.016
don't travel anywhere far.

00:23:09.606 --> 00:23:10.685
Sure.

00:23:23.892 --> 00:23:27.018
You're not involved in their deaths.

00:23:29.516 --> 00:23:31.394
Come and eat.

00:23:31.894 --> 00:23:33.142
Sir...

00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:38.687
Do you see me as one of them?

00:23:44.641 --> 00:23:48.897
There was once a girl
who hired me to kill her.

00:23:51.814 --> 00:23:56.439
Perhaps she lost something,
or had nowhere to go.

00:23:57.438 --> 00:24:00.935
Any particular method?

00:24:01.474 --> 00:24:03.392
I wish I could die without
feeling anything.

00:24:03.472 --> 00:24:07.268
She looked on with blank eyes.

00:24:09.766 --> 00:24:14.851
With her death before her,
she asked me for a favor.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:21.014
She wanted me to
hug her, one last time.

00:24:29.226 --> 00:24:30.934
So warm...

00:24:32.853 --> 00:24:37.648
I didn't want to know
the pain she was feeling,

00:24:38.187 --> 00:24:45.520
and I simply hugged
her without any thought.

00:24:48.307 --> 00:24:55.730
At that last moment, she
said everything will be okay,

00:24:57.058 --> 00:24:59.146
and patted me,

00:24:59.226 --> 00:25:04.890
and asked me not to forget
this moment and smiled.

00:25:06.139 --> 00:25:07.768
But why?

00:25:24.271 --> 00:25:28.307
I became curious about her pain.

00:25:29.186 --> 00:25:32.433
But I could never find out.

00:25:33.602 --> 00:25:39.895
Only her warmth remained on my hand.

00:25:46.309 --> 00:25:48.846
Hye-joo, are you all right?

00:25:48.936 --> 00:25:50.894
Shit, you're curious?

00:25:51.644 --> 00:25:55.849
If you want to save Hye-joo,
come with that asshole.

00:25:56.349 --> 00:25:57.598
I am that asshole.

00:25:58.097 --> 00:25:59.356
Did you see the news?

00:25:59.556 --> 00:26:00.815
You're fucked.

00:26:00.894 --> 00:26:02.183
Did you do that to them?

00:26:02.273 --> 00:26:04.641
No, it was you.

00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:06.189
Don't you remember?

00:26:06.809 --> 00:26:08.017
That knife you took?

00:26:08.097 --> 00:26:10.185
It had your prints all over it.

00:26:11.893 --> 00:26:14.101
Don't do anything stupid
and get over here.

00:26:14.561 --> 00:26:16.938
Be here in an hour or
it's going to the cops.

00:26:17.598 --> 00:26:18.647
Where?

00:26:18.727 --> 00:26:21.853
Call me when you come to
Hongik Station Entrance #2.

00:26:21.973 --> 00:26:24.021
And tell that bitch.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.768
I spent all her money, asshole.

00:26:31.064 --> 00:26:32.103
What do we do?

00:26:32.183 --> 00:26:33.352
Let's see what she wants.

00:26:33.432 --> 00:26:35.480
Let's just call the police.

00:26:56.099 --> 00:26:58.147
I'll come with you.

00:27:01.264 --> 00:27:02.683
You stay here.

00:27:02.772 --> 00:27:04.481
You'll be in my way.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.228
And put this on.

00:28:11.234 --> 00:28:13.152
Encore Cosplay Club

00:28:17.018 --> 00:28:20.724
They got passports, why the hell
did you put them in containers?

00:28:20.814 --> 00:28:23.432
You fucking idiots!

00:28:24.431 --> 00:28:27.018
Shut the fuck up!

00:28:30.065 --> 00:28:31.973
I'm hanging up, I got a customer!

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.348
What do you do here?

00:28:38.017 --> 00:28:40.395
Hey! Keep the door locked!

00:28:40.475 --> 00:28:41.514
Okay.

00:28:41.973 --> 00:28:44.810
Call him. He didn't call yet?

00:28:49.516 --> 00:28:50.894
What do you want?

00:28:53.022 --> 00:28:56.559
I'm here for her, not you.

00:28:57.807 --> 00:28:58.976
Is he...

00:28:59.935 --> 00:29:03.811
It's him, how did he know?

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.188
I was going to tell you on the phone,

00:29:07.478 --> 00:29:11.104
you'll never get your vision back.

00:29:11.564 --> 00:29:13.062
Shit...

00:29:13.142 --> 00:29:16.349
What are you waiting for?

00:29:16.439 --> 00:29:19.895
Are you fucking deaf?

00:29:20.395 --> 00:29:22.063
Shut the hell up.

00:29:29.606 --> 00:29:31.144
Bring me the knife.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.977
Coming in here won't do you any good.

00:29:38.397 --> 00:29:41.683
Do you think you can save her?

00:29:42.722 --> 00:29:46.688
What was the friend's name? Hye-joo?

00:29:48.896 --> 00:29:49.935
Bring the knife.

00:29:50.015 --> 00:29:52.852
Why did you take my
knife in the first place?

00:29:52.932 --> 00:29:54.561
Did you kill those kids?

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.769
Why would I?

00:29:56.019 --> 00:29:57.597
Then it was his fault.

00:30:03.472 --> 00:30:04.431
What are you doing?!

00:30:09.396 --> 00:30:10.604
The knife.

00:30:12.722 --> 00:30:16.728
Don't send her out, just rip her apart.

00:30:21.104 --> 00:30:22.722
Bring me the knife.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:26.728
Fucker.

00:30:26.848 --> 00:30:28.347
Bring it.

00:30:30.065 --> 00:30:31.763
That's enough!

00:30:41.354 --> 00:30:42.473
Don't move.

00:30:42.852 --> 00:30:44.560
It's a Filipino replica,

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.308
but it'll still put a
hole in your head.

00:30:47.438 --> 00:30:51.144
You should call 911 if
you want to save him.

00:30:51.224 --> 00:30:52.473
Shoot him already!

00:30:52.562 --> 00:30:53.432
Shut the hell up!

00:34:10.315 --> 00:34:11.813
Dammit.

00:34:19.186 --> 00:34:20.724
Let me go!

00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:27.727
Nice body.

00:34:27.807 --> 00:34:29.765
Hold still!

00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:32.023
What the fuck?

00:34:37.347 --> 00:34:38.516
Are you all right?

00:34:41.014 --> 00:34:43.601
Do you know where Yoon-ji is?

00:34:47.557 --> 00:34:49.106
Where's Yoon-ji?

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.308
We figured you out.

00:35:16.688 --> 00:35:18.476
I know how you found us.

00:35:21.313 --> 00:35:24.560
She's dead if I get hurt!

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:38.147
Should I dig it out? You
won't need it anyways.

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:50.684
Runaways are all the same.

00:35:50.764 --> 00:35:54.890
Guys hustle and
girls sell their bodies.

00:35:55.519 --> 00:35:58.936
They cover their motel costs. When the girls run
out of money, they come back and do it again.

00:35:59.265 --> 00:36:01.523
Do you know how dangerous that is?

00:36:01.603 --> 00:36:04.690
If a pervert beats a girl,
the guys enter to save her,

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.266
then both get charged for prostitution.

00:36:09.186 --> 00:36:11.813
So, they need an agency like us.

00:36:12.722 --> 00:36:14.770
We keep them safe systematically.

00:36:18.306 --> 00:36:19.765
Why Yoon-ji?

00:36:20.434 --> 00:36:22.103
She wasn't a runaway.

00:36:22.183 --> 00:36:24.181
She was chosen...

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.019
Chosen?

00:36:29.685 --> 00:36:31.773
Go find out yourself!

00:36:32.852 --> 00:36:36.388
Boss will know something's
wrong by now!

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.097
All guys are the same.

00:36:51.683 --> 00:36:54.690
Any deeper and your
artery will be severed.

00:36:55.639 --> 00:36:59.475
You can imagine what'll happen then.

00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:12.432
She's at Don't Tell Papa.

00:37:12.932 --> 00:37:13.731
Is that a club?

00:37:13.851 --> 00:37:17.098
No, it's a motel.

00:37:17.847 --> 00:37:22.063
In Wonju, near Hole in One Golf Course.

00:37:22.222 --> 00:37:24.270
Who chose her?

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.687
I really don't know,
only the boss knows.

00:37:27.807 --> 00:37:29.225
I'm serious.

00:37:30.105 --> 00:37:31.183
Mr. Spotty?

00:37:36.228 --> 00:37:39.645
When cops come, ask
them to send you to the ER.

00:37:46.188 --> 00:37:47.847
Yes, I'm on site.

00:37:48.186 --> 00:37:49.935
I'll keep you posted.

00:37:50.764 --> 00:37:53.022
I really heard someone fighting.

00:37:53.141 --> 00:37:56.648
This place was so suspicious.

00:37:56.768 --> 00:37:59.105
Weird people coming by often.

00:38:07.527 --> 00:38:09.355
Don't Tell Papa

00:38:22.892 --> 00:38:24.390
Damn.

00:41:47.936 --> 00:41:49.225
Where's the girl?

00:41:56.148 --> 00:41:58.226
First one to talk lives.

00:41:58.726 --> 00:41:59.475
Where?

00:41:59.565 --> 00:42:00.973
We really don't know!

00:42:01.773 --> 00:42:05.189
I swear on my mother's grave,
I only did what I was told!

00:42:09.645 --> 00:42:12.102
Don't kill me! Please!

00:42:12.182 --> 00:42:13.311
Please!

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:17.307
Fucking let me live!

00:42:17.437 --> 00:42:19.515
Let me live, you fucker!

00:42:22.272 --> 00:42:24.480
Fine, but if you lie,

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:27.477
I have to go up and
do this all over again.

00:42:29.225 --> 00:42:31.103
Thank you, sir!

00:42:32.522 --> 00:42:35.769
But I really don't know!
That's the truth!

00:42:36.847 --> 00:42:39.645
Fuck, wait, I know who does!

00:42:39.725 --> 00:42:40.724
Who?

00:42:41.473 --> 00:42:42.522
The manager.

00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:43.771
Who's that?

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.058
The one with dreadlocks.

00:42:47.017 --> 00:42:51.013
But he'll never snitch,
he's a stubborn fucker.

00:42:51.143 --> 00:42:54.100
If you let me go, I'll find out!

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:55.639
How?

00:42:55.888 --> 00:42:58.686
I know the kindergarten
where his son goes.

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:05.938
Dreadlocks?

00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:34.190
You know what?

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:38.726
I'm the only one who
knows where the girl is.

00:43:41.063 --> 00:43:42.642
That knife,

00:43:42.851 --> 00:43:44.480
Spetsnaz.

00:43:46.188 --> 00:43:48.306
Ballistic knife.

00:43:48.436 --> 00:43:50.144
It's a great knife.

00:43:53.311 --> 00:43:54.769
Where's the girl?

00:43:56.058 --> 00:43:58.975
My boss suffered a great
loss because of you.

00:43:59.105 --> 00:44:01.273
He'll need more girls,

00:44:01.433 --> 00:44:05.309
including the one you're looking for.

00:44:05.689 --> 00:44:08.606
If you die, I won't
be able to find her.

00:44:11.473 --> 00:44:13.770
Can you survive?

00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:18.765
Donghae Port, Cargo Terminal,
Vladivostok Irina.

00:44:18.975 --> 00:44:20.144
8 AM.

00:44:20.813 --> 00:44:23.311
You better hurry if
you want to find her.

00:46:09.854 --> 00:46:11.353
Hands up!

00:46:12.312 --> 00:46:13.890
Put your hands up!

00:46:17.686 --> 00:46:20.683
Did you kill the girl
from the apartment too?

00:46:20.813 --> 00:46:24.689
I got the evidence from
the rink too, asshole.

00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:28.306
Let's talk after I find the girl.

00:46:28.765 --> 00:46:29.854
What girl?

00:46:31.932 --> 00:46:34.140
Don't try to fool me.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:37.147
You weren't there
when it all went down,

00:46:37.307 --> 00:46:39.814
I'm just a witness, not a suspect.

00:46:39.894 --> 00:46:45.059
It's against the law to keep a witness
from receiving medical attention

00:46:45.519 --> 00:46:47.517
and forcing a confession.

00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:49.934
You're a law expert now?

00:46:50.014 --> 00:46:52.102
You're a piece of work.

00:46:55.059 --> 00:46:55.938
Get in.

00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:55.269
Are you really looking for someone?

00:47:56.777 --> 00:47:58.775
FREEDOM

00:48:29.734 --> 00:48:33.111
IRINA

00:48:38.146 --> 00:48:39.265
Hurry up!

00:48:45.848 --> 00:48:48.396
You crazy son of a bitch!
What are you doing?

00:48:51.522 --> 00:48:53.181
You're fucking nuts!

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.389
Sir.

00:50:15.478 --> 00:50:16.807
Fuck.

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.098
Who chose Yoon-ji?

00:50:46.347 --> 00:50:48.975
Fuck you, bitch!

00:51:20.813 --> 00:51:22.561
Hey, dirty cop,

00:51:22.681 --> 00:51:24.729
your sponsor just died,

00:51:24.889 --> 00:51:27.936
and I have proof of your corruption.

00:51:29.814 --> 00:51:31.183
What should I do?

00:51:33.021 --> 00:51:35.308
I can become your sponsor.

00:51:38.855 --> 00:51:44.270
I needed a dirty cop to
clean up my mess anyways.

00:51:59.814 --> 00:52:01.272
Okay, I'm off.

00:52:05.348 --> 00:52:06.977
I'll be in touch.

00:52:17.696 --> 00:52:20.733
Hospital

00:52:30.643 --> 00:52:32.931
We have the same agency.

00:52:36.347 --> 00:52:37.476
What does that mean?

00:52:37.936 --> 00:52:41.352
We have the same clothes.

00:52:55.728 --> 00:52:57.266
What day is it?

00:52:57.476 --> 00:52:59.065
It's Tuesday.

00:52:59.854 --> 00:53:01.472
You were out for 2 days.

00:53:05.189 --> 00:53:06.597
Is it raining?

00:53:07.097 --> 00:53:11.722
Yeah, it's been raining all day.

00:53:12.851 --> 00:53:14.889
Pitter-patter. Pitter-patter.

00:53:15.558 --> 00:53:17.306
It sounds good.

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:25.438
Police will come by later.

00:53:25.598 --> 00:53:27.606
Tell them everything you know.

00:53:28.515 --> 00:53:29.684
Everything?

00:53:29.814 --> 00:53:30.643
Yeah.

00:53:32.641 --> 00:53:33.810
Everything.

00:53:35.938 --> 00:53:37.606
Where are you going?

00:53:39.434 --> 00:53:40.263
My room.

00:53:40.603 --> 00:53:41.722
Where's your room?

00:53:41.932 --> 00:53:42.851
VIP room.

00:53:44.189 --> 00:53:45.768
Take me there too.

00:53:46.347 --> 00:53:47.686
It's expensive.

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:50.183
You're rich.

00:53:50.263 --> 00:53:51.222
And you're not.

00:53:51.432 --> 00:53:52.731
You can pay for me.

00:53:52.811 --> 00:53:54.729
That's what I'm doing.

00:53:57.646 --> 00:54:00.143
You're so annoying sometimes.

00:54:09.144 --> 00:54:10.723
You...

00:54:11.352 --> 00:54:13.230
as well.

00:54:19.224 --> 00:54:21.642
Can you move to this room?

00:54:22.481 --> 00:54:26.557
No, I hate cops coming in and out.

00:54:28.685 --> 00:54:30.523
I hate...

00:54:31.522 --> 00:54:33.180
being alone.

00:54:51.023 --> 00:54:52.062
Thank you.

00:54:52.641 --> 00:54:53.890
You owe me.

00:54:55.019 --> 00:54:58.265
Then you have to see
me until I get a job.

00:54:58.475 --> 00:55:01.722
No, just send the money,
I'll give you my bank info.

00:55:21.772 --> 00:55:23.350
You're in good shape,

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.639
aside from the scratches...

00:55:24.729 --> 00:55:26.187
How's the clean up?

00:55:26.937 --> 00:55:28.725
It went all right.

00:55:28.855 --> 00:55:32.391
Donghae Port went over smoothly
aside from your statement.

00:55:32.771 --> 00:55:35.138
So you came for my statement?

00:55:35.228 --> 00:55:37.726
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

00:55:38.685 --> 00:55:42.141
We should talk about our agreement.

00:55:45.098 --> 00:55:46.897
The dirty cop talk?

00:55:52.101 --> 00:55:55.019
How did you know I was with Mr. Spotty?

00:55:56.187 --> 00:55:58.185
The body in your trunk.

00:55:59.264 --> 00:56:04.939
He didn't want the girl talking
to the cops, so he had her killed.

00:56:05.348 --> 00:56:09.974
And you came to take the body
away from the apartment.

00:56:10.103 --> 00:56:10.813
Are you there?

00:56:10.893 --> 00:56:12.221
Yes, I'm on site.

00:56:12.311 --> 00:56:16.517
Why would he take
the body to the motel?

00:56:18.055 --> 00:56:23.020
The incinerator behind the motel
isn't for just burning garbage.

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.187
It's used to burn evidence.

00:56:28.605 --> 00:56:30.183
Don't beat yourself up.

00:56:30.273 --> 00:56:32.731
We can come to an agreement.

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.478
How much do you want?

00:56:39.894 --> 00:56:41.772
How much can you afford?

00:56:42.141 --> 00:56:43.890
As much as you want.

00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:47.806
But there's one more
thing you need to do.

00:56:47.936 --> 00:56:48.974
What?

00:56:49.184 --> 00:56:52.771
I need to know who wanted Yoon-ji.

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.598
He and I weren't exactly BFFs
who disclosed such secrets.

00:56:55.688 --> 00:56:58.265
I can give you a lot of money.

00:57:01.102 --> 00:57:03.640
He's connected to the Russian mafia.

00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:05.898
It's out of my hands.

00:57:08.815 --> 00:57:13.140
Our deal extends to finding
out who chose Yoon-ji.

00:57:14.639 --> 00:57:16.647
Remember that.

00:57:30.103 --> 00:57:32.431
Damn, I can't hit for shit.

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.937
Oh my, haven't seen you in a while.

00:57:37.056 --> 00:57:39.724
You want to try some new models?

00:57:40.643 --> 00:57:41.682
Glock?

00:57:41.772 --> 00:57:43.600
Have you ever shot an H&K?

00:57:44.099 --> 00:57:46.807
Let's have a bet.

00:57:48.185 --> 00:57:50.853
I came to ask for a favor.

00:57:51.432 --> 00:57:52.681
Favor?

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:57.146
You've never even asked
for a soda in 6 years,

00:57:58.265 --> 00:58:02.311
I'm afraid of what you'll ask.

00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:05.518
What's with the suspense?

00:58:05.848 --> 00:58:08.225
I need some guns, untraceable.

00:58:08.435 --> 00:58:10.183
What do you need it for?

00:58:12.141 --> 00:58:13.889
Don't ask.

00:58:14.269 --> 00:58:16.687
I'll give you more than market price.

00:58:17.686 --> 00:58:19.264
Ever seen the movie
'The Man from Nowhere'?

00:58:19.354 --> 00:58:21.062
The one with Won Bin.

00:58:21.222 --> 00:58:25.478
A friend of the guy
asking for guns tells him,

00:58:26.437 --> 00:58:29.724
"Don't do whatever
you're thinking of doing".

00:58:30.643 --> 00:58:33.020
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:58:34.938 --> 00:58:35.977
Yeah.

00:58:36.687 --> 00:58:39.764
I know an American
soldier heading back soon.

00:58:40.892 --> 00:58:42.391
I can introduce you.

00:58:42.681 --> 00:58:45.848
Makes no difference
if you get it yourself.

00:58:45.937 --> 00:58:48.105
But I'll feel better.

00:58:48.185 --> 00:58:51.602
And I have to take a
cut as a middle man.

00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:53.440
What model?

00:58:55.438 --> 00:58:57.096
M200 sniper.

00:58:57.855 --> 00:59:00.523
Silencer for it too.

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:04.309
For real?

00:59:04.848 --> 00:59:06.187
How soon can you get it?

00:59:06.267 --> 00:59:08.105
What's really going on?

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:09.764
You know...

00:59:11.971 --> 00:59:14.439
the weather is so gloomy.

00:59:16.347 --> 00:59:17.606
How's it going?

00:59:17.686 --> 00:59:20.353
One more week, huh? Are you having fun?

00:59:20.473 --> 00:59:24.139
Yeah, sweetie, I hit
the club yesterday.

00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:26.347
Guys were all over me,

00:59:26.437 --> 00:59:28.105
I was so tired.

00:59:28.185 --> 00:59:29.314
You went to a country club?

00:59:29.394 --> 00:59:31.392
No, a club, a dance club.

00:59:31.472 --> 00:59:32.641
Club?

00:59:32.890 --> 00:59:35.148
Why would they let you in?

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:37.226
You're so full of it.

00:59:37.396 --> 00:59:39.224
I'm still smoking hot.

00:59:39.354 --> 00:59:40.812
How's the kid?

00:59:41.642 --> 00:59:42.850
Yoon-ji?

00:59:44.019 --> 00:59:45.228
She's good.

00:59:45.398 --> 00:59:46.846
Something's fishy.

00:59:47.726 --> 00:59:48.605
What is?

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:51.432
Well, you always
call my friends' kids...

00:59:51.522 --> 00:59:53.939
Punk Kid 1, Punk Kid 2, and such...

00:59:54.519 --> 00:59:56.017
But you call Yoon-ji by her name.

00:59:56.097 --> 00:59:56.936
You're right.

00:59:57.556 --> 00:59:59.604
Anyways, take care of yourself.

01:00:00.143 --> 01:00:01.312
Got it?

01:00:01.472 --> 01:00:03.939
You too, honey.

01:00:04.808 --> 01:00:06.227
Be careful.

01:00:11.392 --> 01:00:13.020
Was that your wife?

01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:15.228
Yeah.

01:00:15.348 --> 01:00:18.185
Should I guess what you're thinking?

01:00:18.974 --> 01:00:20.063
What am I thinking?

01:00:20.143 --> 01:00:24.479
Whether I can discharge
in a week or not.

01:00:29.064 --> 01:00:32.391
I bet you're scared of her the most.

01:00:34.808 --> 01:00:36.267
I am scared

01:00:37.146 --> 01:00:39.184
of losing her.

01:00:42.561 --> 01:00:45.847
You better get well and be out of here.

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:49.224
The longer you stay, the
more debt you'll have.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:50.972
I'll pay you back.

01:00:51.222 --> 01:00:53.060
You're so cheap for a rich guy.

01:00:53.769 --> 01:00:57.646
If you get out in a week, I
won't charge you interest.

01:00:58.065 --> 01:01:00.103
You were you going
to charge me interest?

01:01:00.183 --> 01:01:03.480
Yeah, 24%, maximum legal amount.

01:01:03.849 --> 01:01:05.767
You're no fun.

01:01:07.805 --> 01:01:11.392
You must be all better
to talk back like that.

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:14.059
Eat up, it's expensive.

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:24.309
Did you find out?

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.307
Money truly is king.

01:01:27.805 --> 01:01:30.523
You can get whatever
information you want.

01:01:30.643 --> 01:01:32.181
Get to the point.

01:01:33.809 --> 01:01:36.806
The request came in through
the Russian mafia.

01:01:37.855 --> 01:01:40.353
It was the Russians who wanted Yoon-ji?

01:01:40.932 --> 01:01:42.680
Not sure about that,

01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:46.557
but once she's in Vladivostok,
she was to be sent

01:01:46.686 --> 01:01:49.144
to a hotel room under the
name Park Hyung-joo.

01:01:49.224 --> 01:01:50.682
Park Hyung-joo?

01:01:54.688 --> 01:01:58.724
This is classified intel
from an Interpol friend.

01:01:58.814 --> 01:02:01.602
Send me a picture of Park Hyung-joo.

01:02:08.265 --> 01:02:13.100
This piece of shit dirty cop
doesn't pick up when I need him!

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:17.895
Hey, are you going to the bank?

01:02:18.065 --> 01:02:19.763
Take the ledger first!

01:02:26.686 --> 01:02:27.606
Fuck!

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:52.351
Park Hyung-joo.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.938
Who asked for Yoon-ji?

01:02:55.098 --> 01:02:58.395
Whose day did I ruin?

01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:04.638
Take it.

01:03:05.558 --> 01:03:06.976
Put it on speaker.

01:03:11.192 --> 01:03:12.191
Mama Pig

01:03:12.192 --> 01:03:13.769
Pick up faster!

01:03:14.598 --> 01:03:15.847
You'll get a text, I'm sorry.

01:03:15.937 --> 01:03:17.516
What's wrong with your voice?

01:03:18.644 --> 01:03:20.972
I'm a bit under the weather...

01:03:21.062 --> 01:03:23.889
Are the girls ready
for the old fart's party?

01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:26.557
Check on "crème de la crème".

01:03:26.686 --> 01:03:27.805
You'll get a text, no mistakes.

01:03:27.935 --> 01:03:30.642
Shit!

01:03:31.931 --> 01:03:33.390
Who's the old fart?

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.687
You'll kill me, won't you?

01:03:36.017 --> 01:03:41.472
Fuck, you won't let me live
after what you've done here!

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:44.848
- It all depends on you.
- Shut your face, asshole!

01:03:48.894 --> 01:03:52.770
Don't give up hope,
you might just live.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.605
I just know he's a judge.

01:03:58.145 --> 01:04:02.021
I worked 10 years for him and
haven't seen his face once!

01:04:03.819 --> 01:04:05.817
KH, Gapyeong, 25

01:04:14.728 --> 01:04:15.977
What does it mean?

01:04:16.976 --> 01:04:18.974
Korean high school.

01:04:19.224 --> 01:04:21.062
Korean national teenagers.

01:04:21.352 --> 01:04:23.849
Rest are locations and dates.

01:04:24.638 --> 01:04:25.478
Go on.

01:04:25.597 --> 01:04:27.895
The Ant Museum in Gapyeong.

01:04:28.225 --> 01:04:30.522
The resort is beside it, you'll see it.

01:04:31.142 --> 01:04:34.848
You don't look like a civilian,

01:04:34.978 --> 01:04:38.265
but these guys are on another level.

01:04:40.682 --> 01:04:42.021
How do you find girls?

01:04:42.101 --> 01:04:44.898
Here and there, Yang and me!

01:04:45.647 --> 01:04:48.065
We hand them over to Mama Pig,

01:04:48.225 --> 01:04:51.222
then she dresses them
up to the judge's taste.

01:04:51.312 --> 01:04:54.518
He's not satisfied with
Korean girls nowadays,

01:04:54.638 --> 01:04:56.806
so he gets girls from
the Russian mafia.

01:04:57.306 --> 01:04:58.684
Russian mafia?

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.851
Not the real mafia.

01:05:02.391 --> 01:05:06.896
They run a hotel in Sakhalin
and trade girls out of there,

01:05:07.306 --> 01:05:10.892
and expanded to Vladivostok.

01:05:11.392 --> 01:05:15.018
The judge hired his
bodyguard from there.

01:05:15.937 --> 01:05:18.814
They take Korean girls
to Russia for sex trade,

01:05:19.184 --> 01:05:21.601
then get rid of them
once they're all used up?

01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:24.059
Koreans are popular these days.

01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:26.686
It's a fucking cultural exchange!

01:05:26.806 --> 01:05:29.354
Koreans to Russia, Russians
to Southeast Asia.

01:05:29.434 --> 01:05:32.351
Southeast Asians are traded to Korea.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.397
Shit, I'm the CEO of an
entertainment company!

01:05:38.065 --> 01:05:41.312
Our clients have a
wide variety of tastes,

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:43.439
and not enough supply.

01:05:43.599 --> 01:05:46.646
JH, CH, AH, shit.

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:49.603
I can get them all for you, deal?

01:05:50.932 --> 01:05:51.601
Yeah.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.390
Look who it is.

01:05:53.519 --> 01:05:56.686
Little bird told me
you retired, is it true?

01:05:56.856 --> 01:05:58.814
Ocean

01:06:07.106 --> 01:06:08.644
Put your hood on.

01:06:08.724 --> 01:06:10.223
Screw you.

01:06:24.059 --> 01:06:27.186
I'm the one who heard
about your retirement,

01:06:27.356 --> 01:06:32.101
you have a condition,
pal, go see a shrink.

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.898
I had a good reason.

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:39.014
A major clean up will
be needed in Gapyeong.

01:06:39.144 --> 01:06:41.222
Do that one last job for me.

01:06:43.439 --> 01:06:45.647
I only do special cleanings these days.

01:06:45.767 --> 01:06:49.973
My specialty is suicide clean
up with legitimate bodies.

01:06:50.223 --> 01:06:53.939
Let me be a good father to my kids.

01:06:54.019 --> 01:06:57.186
Nowadays, a rich
father is a good father.

01:06:57.855 --> 01:07:00.353
I'll pay you double.

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:03.939
It's not about the money.

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:06.556
Triple.

01:07:09.014 --> 01:07:10.772
Quadruple?

01:07:13.809 --> 01:07:15.647
I'll give you a shout soon.

01:07:18.315 --> 01:07:21.182
Hurry up over there, get a move on!

01:07:23.979 --> 01:07:25.188
Closed shop today?

01:07:25.268 --> 01:07:26.646
Yeah, of course.

01:07:26.726 --> 01:07:30.183
I don't want to advertise
that I'm selling guns here.

01:07:30.772 --> 01:07:32.141
Got the stuff?

01:07:32.311 --> 01:07:34.309
You have to thank me.

01:07:34.478 --> 01:07:38.814
You know I never
touch this stuff, right?

01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:41.731
Is this it?

01:07:42.021 --> 01:07:43.389
Can't take this back.

01:07:43.479 --> 01:07:46.436
The soldier who got me
this flew out this morning.

01:07:46.556 --> 01:07:48.015
No refunds either.

01:07:49.393 --> 01:07:50.522
What if something is wrong with it?

01:07:50.602 --> 01:07:52.231
You know how it is.

01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:54.848
You want a receipt with that too?

01:07:55.018 --> 01:07:58.105
You want to take it in for
service if it doesn't work?

01:07:59.184 --> 01:08:01.391
Anyways, is this the model I asked for?

01:08:01.681 --> 01:08:03.060
I have no idea.

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:05.517
What if I unbox it and find a brick?

01:08:05.597 --> 01:08:09.473
How long have you been
dealing with me, don't be absurd!

01:08:09.603 --> 01:08:11.142
You said you've never done this.

01:08:11.272 --> 01:08:13.599
I haven't, for fuck's sake.

01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:25.647
At least it's not a brick.

01:08:53.769 --> 01:08:56.266
I thought he sent a tank or something.

01:08:57.975 --> 01:08:59.184
Hold on a sec.

01:09:02.101 --> 01:09:03.889
Didn't you say you were
an armorer for 30 years?

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:07.056
I'm just making sure, that's all.

01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:24.308
What is it?

01:09:24.388 --> 01:09:25.687
Where are you?

01:09:25.767 --> 01:09:27.345
How are you feeling?

01:09:29.603 --> 01:09:31.431
I can get out in a few days.

01:09:31.721 --> 01:09:33.519
I stopped the interest.

01:09:33.599 --> 01:09:36.436
It's good to be young,
why are you calling?

01:09:36.936 --> 01:09:38.434
Just because.

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:41.182
Just because why?

01:09:45.767 --> 01:09:49.223
Hye-joo's mom came by today.

01:09:51.561 --> 01:09:53.689
Did she say something to you?

01:09:56.896 --> 01:10:00.892
Hye-joo committed suicide,

01:10:03.519 --> 01:10:06.186
and she blamed me.

01:10:10.023 --> 01:10:12.141
When are you coming?

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.849
In the evening.

01:10:14.648 --> 01:10:17.225
Can you come sooner?

01:10:19.263 --> 01:10:20.602
Okay.

01:11:01.441 --> 01:11:05.197
Police Department

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:08.514
Hey, dirty cop.

01:11:08.814 --> 01:11:11.891
Didn't I tell you to call
from a burner phone?

01:11:11.981 --> 01:11:14.059
Then you should have picked up.

01:11:14.138 --> 01:11:16.976
It's not like I jerk around.

01:11:17.145 --> 01:11:20.522
Yoon-ji's mom isn't
her biological mother.

01:11:20.812 --> 01:11:23.060
Her dad passed 3 years ago,

01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:25.267
and she's with her stepmom now.

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:27.145
And the judge you asked about

01:11:27.435 --> 01:11:28.894
is the Chief Justice of
the Central District Court.

01:11:29.603 --> 01:11:32.310
Family wealth is considerable,

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:36.096
and has strong political influence.

01:11:36.766 --> 01:11:40.102
Why the hell did you want me
to look into such a big fish?

01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:44.348
Do me a favor.

01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:10.602
Alex!

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:12.350
Boris!

01:13:13.809 --> 01:13:14.768
Come in!

01:13:15.597 --> 01:13:16.976
Come in!

01:13:58.973 --> 01:14:00.392
Drop your weapon.

01:14:03.889 --> 01:14:05.807
Put the gun down, bastard.

01:14:27.435 --> 01:14:30.772
Is the situation under
control, Detective Lee?

01:14:30.852 --> 01:14:32.810
Yes, it's done.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.936
This guy is the real deal.

01:14:57.145 --> 01:14:59.473
Look at that knife.

01:15:00.772 --> 01:15:03.888
Where did he get the gun?

01:15:04.228 --> 01:15:05.347
Is it you?

01:15:07.015 --> 01:15:08.514
Did you pick Yoon-ji?

01:15:15.557 --> 01:15:17.055
I'm Kim Jung-hoon.

01:15:26.306 --> 01:15:30.182
Detective Lee tells me
you're a famous mercenary.

01:15:31.271 --> 01:15:32.270
What?

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:37.265
Either a rich mercenary,
or a rich judge with power.

01:15:38.184 --> 01:15:39.603
No contest.

01:15:41.481 --> 01:15:42.640
You're one of a kind.

01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:46.226
Detective Lee, take care of him.

01:15:46.356 --> 01:15:47.515
Don't worry, sir.

01:15:47.605 --> 01:15:49.813
I'll make it look like a suicide.

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:51.890
Give me his gun.

01:15:56.606 --> 01:15:57.815
Let's go.

01:16:05.187 --> 01:16:07.265
He's so scary, right?

01:16:07.355 --> 01:16:09.313
I'll comfort you.

01:16:17.725 --> 01:16:21.231
You know I have evidence
of your corruption, right?

01:16:23.139 --> 01:16:25.517
That perverted judge will bail me out.

01:16:26.646 --> 01:16:29.603
This is where power comes in handy.

01:16:40.851 --> 01:16:43.978
All good things must be shared.

01:17:47.185 --> 01:17:48.264
Wait, wait.

01:17:49.353 --> 01:17:54.018
Why did I let you catch
me? To get to the judge.

01:17:54.727 --> 01:17:55.976
Wait, wait!

01:22:36.396 --> 01:22:37.934
Put something on.

01:22:43.768 --> 01:22:45.516
No need to look around.

01:22:45.686 --> 01:22:47.764
No one is coming to save you.

01:23:16.645 --> 01:23:20.062
I'm the next Supreme Court Justice.

01:23:20.391 --> 01:23:25.227
A favor from someone
like me is worth a lot.

01:23:25.516 --> 01:23:27.065
Perhaps.

01:23:29.183 --> 01:23:31.061
One call from me,

01:23:31.810 --> 01:23:34.308
you're safe from everything
that's happened.

01:23:34.397 --> 01:23:36.815
And everything that will happen.

01:23:37.145 --> 01:23:38.643
And Mama Pig?

01:23:39.023 --> 01:23:40.521
Right, Mama Pig.

01:23:42.230 --> 01:23:44.477
That girl's mom is in the middle of it.

01:23:44.597 --> 01:23:47.564
She used to deal with the upper class,

01:23:47.644 --> 01:23:51.770
but she got caught for prostituting
minors and offered Yoon-ji to me first.

01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:54.058
So she's the worse one,

01:23:54.148 --> 01:23:56.016
she's a real bitch!

01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:04.937
Let's blame it all on
her and Detective Lee,

01:24:06.016 --> 01:24:07.684
and call it a day.

01:24:09.103 --> 01:24:10.062
How about it?

01:24:35.766 --> 01:24:38.643
And you keep doing what you do?

01:24:39.312 --> 01:24:42.639
Thanks to you, my connections
to the girls went poof.

01:24:42.769 --> 01:24:44.897
I can't do it anymore.

01:24:45.896 --> 01:24:47.514
I'll just watch some porn.

01:24:59.103 --> 01:25:01.480
Anyways, who manages this place?

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:03.348
Mama Pig.

01:25:04.397 --> 01:25:07.314
We can just blame everything on her.

01:25:10.851 --> 01:25:13.099
Then she can clean this up.

01:25:14.557 --> 01:25:18.064
Clean what up?

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.308
This.

01:26:08.184 --> 01:26:10.102
- Incredible.
- It's true.

01:26:11.061 --> 01:26:13.478
I'm going to go to the washroom.

01:26:13.598 --> 01:26:15.556
Okay, I'll be on the beach.

01:26:15.646 --> 01:26:16.645
All right.

01:26:39.902 --> 01:26:41.570
Judge Kim

01:26:50.931 --> 01:26:55.306
Hey baby, sorry about that.

01:26:56.056 --> 01:26:58.183
Things got messed up this time.

01:26:59.562 --> 01:27:02.060
I'll send you another ripe...

01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.848
Your baby's not there.

01:27:09.352 --> 01:27:11.480
How much do you know about me?

01:27:14.058 --> 01:27:18.973
I get sensitive when
my wife is involved.

01:27:19.642 --> 01:27:21.520
Take it easy.

01:27:28.014 --> 01:27:29.972
Why did you get close to my wife?

01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:35.516
I heard her husband
owned a few buildings.

01:27:35.606 --> 01:27:37.854
Is that why you used your daughter?

01:27:37.934 --> 01:27:38.813
For money?

01:27:38.893 --> 01:27:42.939
Which men don't like young girls?

01:27:50.271 --> 01:27:51.560
Let's go.

01:28:17.974 --> 01:28:19.182
Stop here.

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:36.815
I'll take care of her
until she's an adult.

01:28:39.522 --> 01:28:41.730
Was that the reason?

01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:45.806
All men are the fucking same!

01:28:46.565 --> 01:28:48.933
Filthy whore!

01:28:49.772 --> 01:28:53.598
Bitches like her deserve to die!

01:28:59.972 --> 01:29:02.639
No child deserves to die.

01:30:08.063 --> 01:30:11.230
You should become a photographer.

01:30:18.393 --> 01:30:20.641
I kept my promise.
