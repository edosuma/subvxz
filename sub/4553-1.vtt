01:02.209 --> 01:03.437
See...

01:03.643 --> 01:05.838
...man ain't like a dog.

01:06.213 --> 01:08.306
And when I say "man,"

01:08.515 --> 01:12.315
I'm talking about man
as in mankind, not man as in men.

01:12.519 --> 01:13.952
Because men,

01:14.154 --> 01:16.418
well, we a lot like a dog.

01:16.623 --> 01:19.490
You know, we like to piss on things.

01:20.026 --> 01:22.017
Sniff a bitch when we can.

01:22.229 --> 01:25.221
Even get a little pink hard-on
the way they do.

01:25.432 --> 01:29.232
We territorial as shit, you know,
we gonna protect our own.

01:29.569 --> 01:31.434
But man...

01:32.105 --> 01:34.232
...he know about death.

01:34.674 --> 01:37.040
Got him a sense of history.

01:37.577 --> 01:39.067
Got religion.

01:39.279 --> 01:40.712
See...

01:40.914 --> 01:42.404
...a dog...

01:42.616 --> 01:47.076
Man, a dog don't know shit
about no birthdays or Christmas

01:47.287 --> 01:49.380
or Easter bunny, none of that shit.

01:49.589 --> 01:51.079
And one day
God gonna come calling,

01:51.291 --> 01:53.589
so, you know,
they going through life carefree.

01:53.794 --> 01:57.093
But people like you and me, man,
we always guessing.

01:57.297 --> 02:00.562
Wondering, "What if?"
You know what I mean?

02:02.335 --> 02:04.394
So when you say to me,

02:04.604 --> 02:06.265
"Hey, I don't think
we should be doing this,"

02:06.473 --> 02:09.567
I gotta say, baby, I don't think
we need to be doing this neither,

02:09.776 --> 02:12.677
but we ain't gonna get no move on
in this world, lying around in the sun,

02:12.879 --> 02:14.813
licking our ass all day.

02:15.015 --> 02:16.812
I mean, we man.

02:17.017 --> 02:20.783
I mean, you a woman and all,
but we man.

02:21.888 --> 02:23.913
So with this said...

02:24.591 --> 02:29.460
...you tell me what it is
you wanna do with your life.

02:42.809 --> 02:44.743
I don't know.

02:45.579 --> 02:48.980
- I mean, I guess I could, like...
- Hold up a second.

02:53.453 --> 02:55.683
What's happening with you, man?

02:58.024 --> 03:00.322
You like what you see, huh?

03:02.896 --> 03:05.160
Look here, baby,

03:05.365 --> 03:07.856
Twenty in the front, 40 in the back.

03:09.302 --> 03:11.031
Hello?

03:12.906 --> 03:16.603
Why don't you walk over there
and explain it to that motherfucker.

04:39.926 --> 04:41.655
- Damn.

04:41.861 --> 04:43.385
I'm Dennis Phillippi, and the answer...

04:46.099 --> 04:49.500
- Hot 107. 1, number one for hip-hop...
- Nothing but a bunch of jive and junk.

04:49.703 --> 04:51.694
Coming up, your chance
to win a trip to Las Vegas.

04:52.238 --> 04:55.901
Holler at your boy, it's Hot 107. 1.

05:14.561 --> 05:17.655
- Please! Fucking with me, man! Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

05:17.864 --> 05:18.922
Hey, what the hell?!

05:19.132 --> 05:21.191
- Pull that shit again,
- Motherfucker, how you like that?

05:21.401 --> 05:22.732
Boot your ass to hell.

05:23.036 --> 05:24.799
- You heard me!
- Get the fuck up out of here.

05:25.005 --> 05:27.166
Deranged son of a bitch!

05:32.445 --> 05:35.937
- You all right, Nola?
- Thanks, D.

05:36.149 --> 05:39.482
Come on in, man. Come on in here.

05:39.686 --> 05:42.211
Damn, man, you gotta
get some security up in here.

05:42.422 --> 05:44.890
I'm the only
motherfucking security in here.

05:46.726 --> 05:49.160
Sure is good
not to be cracking heads.

05:49.362 --> 05:51.262
So, what you need, man,
a half or full O?

05:51.464 --> 05:55.059
Ounce will do good.
Fourth coming up and all.

05:55.301 --> 05:57.132
Righteous, man.

05:57.337 --> 05:59.032
Hey, you remember
that sticky herb you brung up

05:59.239 --> 06:01.298
to my brother's house for playoffs?

06:02.208 --> 06:05.541
Yeah, I remember that shit.
That ain't this, now, man.

06:05.745 --> 06:08.714
We talking about... That's
a whole other zip-up bag on that.

06:08.915 --> 06:10.576
That's fucking prime product
right there.

06:11.017 --> 06:14.145
We got some big company
coming in here for the Fourth.

06:14.354 --> 06:16.982
Thought you may want
to get you some money.

06:17.190 --> 06:18.782
- Big company?
- Yeah.

06:18.992 --> 06:21.927

06:22.362 --> 06:23.624

06:23.830 --> 06:25.764
Yeah, that...
Yeah, I know who Skinny is, man.

06:25.965 --> 06:28.058
I know Skinny from
way back in the day.

06:28.268 --> 06:30.498
See, I know Skinny
when he was hustling

06:30.704 --> 06:33.195
his underground tapes
down at the drive-in,

06:33.406 --> 06:35.670
out the back of his Cutlass.

06:35.875 --> 06:39.436
Not no more he ain't.
Last one he put out went platinum.

06:39.646 --> 06:41.944
- Platinum?
- Yeah.

06:42.148 --> 06:44.878
- That's more special than gold, right?
- But he's still in Memphis.

06:45.085 --> 06:47.986
He and his brother Tigga hook up with
their friends every Fourth of July.

06:48.421 --> 06:51.117
I shut the place down,
make it all private for them.

06:51.791 --> 06:53.019
And they just buy me out.

06:53.226 --> 06:54.921
- Bullshit.
- No shit.

06:55.128 --> 06:56.618
Yo, Skinny rolling like that, man?

06:56.830 --> 06:59.697
Best get your ass up here

06:59.899 --> 07:01.764
Those boys don't want
none of this dirt weed.

07:02.435 --> 07:04.130
So you're trying
to hurt my feelings, right?

07:04.337 --> 07:07.636
- Just trying to help out a friend.
- For sure, man.

07:17.183 --> 07:19.242
All right, all right, all right,

07:19.452 --> 07:22.910

You gonna love this shit.

07:24.424 --> 07:27.689
These lovely ladies will be doing
two dances for the price of one.

07:27.894 --> 07:30.658
We got Luscious, we got Phoebe

07:34.901 --> 07:36.596

07:36.803 --> 07:37.827
Yeah, sorry, man.

07:38.037 --> 07:39.868

- What the fuck? Will you let me...

08:08.935 --> 08:12.598
These lovely ladies will be giving you
two dances for the price of one.

08:12.806 --> 08:15.900
- Come here. Excuse me, daddy.
- Don't you see me on a hustle?

08:16.109 --> 08:17.542
- Where you at?
- I ain't at shit.

08:17.744 --> 08:19.336
- I was on my third dance.
- Don't tell me...

08:19.546 --> 08:21.537
You think I can just run up in here,
snap my fingers

08:21.748 --> 08:23.739
and make these motherfuckers
throw their money at me?

08:23.950 --> 08:27.579
- Watch your motherfucking tone...
- I ain't even made payout yet!

08:27.787 --> 08:29.414
This one is pretty good.

08:29.622 --> 08:32.113
My motherfucking house
got broken into too, bitch.

08:32.325 --> 08:33.792
- Hell, no.
- Hell, yeah, they kicked

08:33.993 --> 08:37.895
both my doors in, girl. Stole the last
pound of hydro weed for the party.

08:38.498 --> 08:40.466
You hear that?

08:41.100 --> 08:44.227
That's my gut saying,
"Hurry the fuck up," okay?

08:46.306 --> 08:47.773
- Come on.
- Look at this.

08:48.474 --> 08:51.375
Hell, no. Look at this shit. What

08:51.578 --> 08:54.445
Lights on, lights off. Don't play.
I'm gonna roll tonight.

08:55.114 --> 08:58.948
I don't care what you say, D,
I ain't working day shift no more.

08:59.419 --> 09:02.183
I don't care if I got to
take me a taxi ride home.

09:02.388 --> 09:05.221

09:05.425 --> 09:08.087

09:17.904 --> 09:20.338
- Bitch got that birthmark on her face?
- Five hundred dollars

09:20.540 --> 09:22.735

10:05.385 --> 10:07.285
You know the business.

10:07.887 --> 10:10.321
- You took that shit from little kids?
- No, none of that, man.

10:10.523 --> 10:13.492

Fuck with me, now, D.

10:33.413 --> 10:36.109

10:40.320 --> 10:43.414
Man, you mean a half and some. I can

10:43.623 --> 10:45.853
Take that shit to the pawnshop,

10:46.059 --> 10:48.254
No, take it over there, man.

10:48.461 --> 10:51.692

11:28.801 --> 11:32.897
I called the power company about
getting an extension on the light bill.

11:33.106 --> 11:36.200
They say I gotta come down there,
stand in line.

11:36.409 --> 11:38.604
I can't be standing in line
how they do down there,

11:38.811 --> 11:40.972

11:54.427 --> 11:58.124
Look right there, look at that.
That is Skinny Black, man.

11:58.331 --> 12:01.664
Me and him gonna be kicking it over

12:01.868 --> 12:05.736

- Who, you?

12:05.938 --> 12:08.498
Yeah, me and Skinny gonna do us

Okay, let's see who it is

- Where my baby, Roger, at?
- No, no, Lex, please!

12:25.258 --> 12:27.453
I just put him to sleep, Lex!

12:27.660 --> 12:30.424
Skinny used to DJ over at Booker T.
The same way I did at Westwood.

12:30.630 --> 12:32.427
D, I know it's my job and all...

12:32.632 --> 12:34.293
Ain't like he the only nigga

12:34.500 --> 12:35.865
- But why she gotta wake Roger up?

12:36.302 --> 12:38.270
Ain't like he the only nigga
can spit some flow.

12:38.471 --> 12:39.563
D, I need time for me too,
now.

12:39.772 --> 12:43.139
Shit, I was just doing the same thing,
just over at my school.

12:43.342 --> 12:47.369
Ask anybody, man. Go ask Carlos
on the corner, he'd tell you.

12:47.580 --> 12:49.707
He was in my grade. Ask him.

12:50.249 --> 12:52.979
We gotta get that extension, D.

12:55.955 --> 12:59.288
Fuck. Paper money. Shit.

12:59.992 --> 13:01.892
See, now, back in the day
you wouldn't even catch me

13:02.095 --> 13:04.325

13:04.530 --> 13:08.022
Bitch. Shit, back in the day,

13:08.234 --> 13:09.861

- I don't give a fuck, man.

13:13.239 --> 13:15.537
- I need you to watch Roger for me.
- Hey, give him to Shug!

13:15.741 --> 13:18.471
Shug say it's her chill time.
Come on.

13:18.678 --> 13:21.408

Hey, man, you can't be

13:40.199 --> 13:43.362
Hey. Hey, get rid

13:43.569 --> 13:48.131
No. Cut them tears shit out, man.
Come on.

14:01.387 --> 14:03.218
All right, push that one.

14:14.634 --> 14:16.499
Do that. What is this right here?

14:22.241 --> 14:24.436
Hey, I like that, man. Do that again.

14:24.644 --> 14:26.509
Listen to that, man.

14:27.613 --> 14:30.673
Now, that shit buck, ain't it, man?
Do it again, man.

14:30.883 --> 14:32.908
What the fuck you doing
with my boy?

14:33.119 --> 14:34.916
- Come on, give him to me.
- We just playing.

14:35.121 --> 14:36.145
- Give him to me.
- Come on...

14:36.355 --> 14:38.687
- He don't need to be playing.
- That's what I'm talking about.

14:38.891 --> 14:41.451
Every time he gets settled,
you gotta come fuck with him!

14:41.661 --> 14:44.630
I'm telling you, you gonna
give that little boy a twitch!

15:03.449 --> 15:07.249
Better go easy, girl.
Man can't be no open candy store.

15:07.453 --> 15:09.921
We tight this whole week.

15:10.957 --> 15:14.449
Put your shine on, man.
I hear this one coming.

15:18.030 --> 15:20.089
What's happening with you, man?

15:20.299 --> 15:22.733
Don't act scared, man,
she don't bite.

15:22.935 --> 15:25.165
She just nibbles a little bit.

15:26.472 --> 15:30.499
Come on... Hey, hey. Damn.

15:30.710 --> 15:34.043
Why can't I work the motels
anymore, D? At least they got air.

15:34.247 --> 15:36.272
At least they take a cut
is what they do.

15:36.682 --> 15:39.947
Thirty dollars an hour
on top of what we already charging,

15:40.152 --> 15:42.586
for what, a five-minute nut?

15:42.788 --> 15:44.619
Taking money out of my pocket
trying to keep

15:44.824 --> 15:46.121
your little country ass cool.

15:46.325 --> 15:46.892
God, D, all I did was ask about a motel
and you get so ugly with me.

15:46.892 --> 15:49.725
God, D, all I did was ask about a motel
and you get so ugly with me.

15:49.929 --> 15:51.988
- He's coming back.
- I'm all wet and sticky.

15:52.198 --> 15:53.859
You gonna have to put a show on
for this one.

15:54.066 --> 15:57.331
Do that little shit you do
with your tongue.

15:57.737 --> 16:00.103
Now, come on, he's coming back.
Get your mind right, okay?

16:00.306 --> 16:03.173
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Fuck.

16:03.576 --> 16:05.407
Fuck, man!

16:05.611 --> 16:08.375
How come Lex gets to work
out of that strip club, and I can't?

16:08.581 --> 16:10.674
Because we done been over this
ten times, Nola.

16:10.883 --> 16:12.612
You got what they call
a bad equilibrium.

16:12.818 --> 16:15.616
And it ain't your fault,
you just knock into shit.

16:15.821 --> 16:17.914
I put you on that stage
in them heels,

16:18.124 --> 16:19.386
tricks gonna be yelling, "Timber."

16:19.592 --> 16:23.050
I'm in heels out here every day.
You don't see me fall down once...

16:23.262 --> 16:27.392
Because you sitting, Nola.
Ain't that much of a fall to the floor.

16:27.833 --> 16:31.234
Lookit, why don't you just let me do
the thinking for you, okay?

16:31.437 --> 16:34.031
You do what you do,
and you let me do what I do.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.141
One day, you'll have to tell me
about that.

16:37.343 --> 16:39.072
About what?

16:40.513 --> 16:41.844
What the fuck it is you do.

16:44.984 --> 16:46.849
What did you just say to me?

16:50.890 --> 16:52.755
Hi, honey.

16:54.860 --> 16:57.852
Wanna see me walk in these heels
all the way to your lap?

16:58.998 --> 17:00.863
I'll be right there.

17:05.137 --> 17:07.901
Looks like he got air in his car, D.

17:09.275 --> 17:10.867
Must be working hard as you.

17:56.489 --> 18:00.255
Fuck you doing, man?
Doing my job? I got a mop for you.

18:00.459 --> 18:02.654
Elroy, I'm having me a day
that won't quit,

18:02.862 --> 18:06.798
so I'll need you to shed
just a little light on me, okay?

18:07.199 --> 18:08.928
You got something for me?

18:09.135 --> 18:13.401
Yeah. I got a grocery list for you too.
I need a...

18:13.606 --> 18:15.801
A brick of that Big Easy bud.

18:17.510 --> 18:19.000
What the fuck is this, man?

18:19.211 --> 18:22.146
Got your stank all over this.
I don't even like my own sweat, D.

18:22.348 --> 18:23.747
What the fuck is this?

18:25.050 --> 18:28.781
Okay. Let's do it this way, then.

18:29.422 --> 18:32.585
Let's give it some
of my sweet juices on it...

18:34.527 --> 18:36.927
...and tell me you ain't
gonna take that.

18:39.632 --> 18:41.623
You better watch yourself, D.

18:43.736 --> 18:45.931
Let me get you on your way.

18:48.207 --> 18:50.072
You cool yet?

19:01.720 --> 19:03.347
You still into that shit, man?

19:06.459 --> 19:08.154
I remember Coach Rosallis
used to let you flow

19:08.360 --> 19:10.385
over the intercom in gym class,

19:10.596 --> 19:13.531
back when we used to beatbox
like the Fat Boys, remember that?

19:15.534 --> 19:17.297
Dude, man,
we went to East Middle together.

19:17.503 --> 19:19.596
Clyde. Called me Key.

19:19.805 --> 19:22.205
- Nigga, what's up, man?
- How you feeling, man?

19:22.408 --> 19:25.468
Yeah, you used to spin them
little records at the after-school joints.

19:25.678 --> 19:28.476
Yeah, yeah. It's not like I was
scratching or nothing like that.

19:28.681 --> 19:31.650
I just made sure "Purple Rain"
got played for the ladies, that's all.

19:31.851 --> 19:34.820
- Let me get these batteries, man.
- "Purple Rain."

19:37.022 --> 19:39.650
Hey, give over, man. He cool. He cool.

19:39.859 --> 19:41.986
East Middle, man.
Them was the days, man.

19:42.194 --> 19:44.492
- Yeah, man.
- Them was the days.

19:44.697 --> 19:47.029
I see you still doing the same.

19:47.233 --> 19:50.031
Oh, yeah, you know,
like the post office:

19:50.236 --> 19:52.898
- Through rain, sleet or snow.
- You looking good, though, man.

19:53.105 --> 19:56.404
So, what, you got you
a dildo or something?

19:56.876 --> 19:58.741
A do-what?

19:58.944 --> 20:01.469
I mean, what's all the batteries for?

20:02.147 --> 20:04.138
It ain't for no dildo,
I'll tell you that right now.

20:04.350 --> 20:06.750
- I'm just fucking with you, man.
- Okay, okay.

20:06.952 --> 20:09.079
They for my microphones, man.

20:09.288 --> 20:11.552
- Microphones?
- Yeah.

20:12.057 --> 20:13.991
So, what do you do?

20:30.776 --> 20:34.576
I told Jesus

20:34.780 --> 20:39.581
It would be all right

20:39.785 --> 20:44.313
If he changed my name

20:50.829 --> 20:55.061
I told Jesus

20:55.267 --> 21:00.227
It would be all right

21:00.439 --> 21:04.899
If he changed my name

21:11.083 --> 21:15.019
I told Jesus

21:15.220 --> 21:20.283
It would be all right

21:20.492 --> 21:26.829
If he changed

21:28.334 --> 21:33.067
My name

21:47.219 --> 21:50.780
- Jesus told me
- Jesus

21:51.490 --> 21:56.189
That the world would be against me

21:56.395 --> 22:04.359
- If he changed
- Changed my

22:04.570 --> 22:10.008
My

22:14.580 --> 22:18.710
Name

22:29.228 --> 22:32.720
Hey, Shug. Shug.

22:33.298 --> 22:34.822
Wake up.

22:37.503 --> 22:39.266
What, I gotta watch the baby?

22:39.471 --> 22:41.666
No, everybody asleep.

22:46.679 --> 22:50.137
- So he kicking now, huh?
- Usually after I eat.

22:50.349 --> 22:53.375
He real active
during the day, though.

22:53.585 --> 22:57.248
He must get that after his daddy.
He sure don't get that from me.

22:58.424 --> 22:59.789
Whoever that is, huh?

23:03.462 --> 23:07.296
You know, Shug,
you and me, we got history, right?

23:08.267 --> 23:13.330
I mean, you been tricking for me
for a few now, so we got that, right?

23:14.773 --> 23:18.869
And me not pimping you
because of...

23:19.078 --> 23:21.137
...your demonstration,

23:21.346 --> 23:23.746
it just puts us in a whole...

23:28.921 --> 23:31.082
...different kind of place,
you know what I mean?

23:32.257 --> 23:33.918
You want me to leave.

23:37.029 --> 23:38.087
Hell, no.

23:39.064 --> 23:41.328
Why would you say
something like that?

23:44.737 --> 23:46.932
I just feel like...

23:47.406 --> 23:51.809
Like I'm having one of them
midlife crisis, you know?

23:55.214 --> 23:57.546
I mean, my daddy...

23:58.550 --> 24:01.815
...you know, his heart
gave out on him when he was, like...

24:03.455 --> 24:06.117
Well, shit, when I was 12 years old.

24:06.325 --> 24:08.020
Shit, he was my age.

24:08.527 --> 24:10.017
And that shit just been...

24:10.229 --> 24:13.426
Just been fucking
with my mind, you know?

24:14.333 --> 24:17.302
It got me feeling
like this is it for me.

24:20.539 --> 24:24.202
I just don't know what
I'm supposed... Supposed to do.

24:28.247 --> 24:30.807
I get bad dreams.

24:31.450 --> 24:35.352
Dreams like me giving birth
to dead dogs.

24:36.054 --> 24:39.546
Sometimes I'm breast-feeding
a big old ugly catfish.

24:40.826 --> 24:43.021
- For real?
- Yeah.

24:43.228 --> 24:47.358
But that's just my mind

24:47.566 --> 24:50.933
touching in on something
I ain't said yet.

24:52.204 --> 24:53.762
What's that?

25:01.847 --> 25:03.280
I'm scared, D.

25:06.418 --> 25:09.012
Sometimes I just get so scared...

25:20.465 --> 25:22.524
Most gracious and heavenly Father,
we pray that you

25:22.734 --> 25:25.601
bless this food and this house
in Jesus' name. Amen.

25:26.205 --> 25:28.070
Amen.

25:28.273 --> 25:30.707
So Beth Ann tells me

25:30.909 --> 25:33.537
the reason I didn't
get that sales-supervisor position

25:33.745 --> 25:35.736
is because she says I have issues

25:35.948 --> 25:38.746
enforcing company policy
with my coworkers,

25:38.951 --> 25:41.078
who, by the way,
she referred to as my friends.

25:41.753 --> 25:43.687
Not "coworkers," mind you,
but "friends."

25:43.889 --> 25:46.153
And I said to her,
"Hey, just because I am pleasant

25:46.358 --> 25:49.259
and supportive does not mean
that I cannot crack a whip."

25:49.461 --> 25:50.951
Because, you know,
I can crack a whip.

25:51.797 --> 25:52.821
Yeah, you can, baby.

25:53.031 --> 25:55.625
Because what we talking about here,
huh? Folding some sweaters?

25:55.834 --> 25:58.325
Shoot, sales supervisors
don't even handle the safe.

25:58.537 --> 26:02.064
So I go in and I talk to Leonard.
Because he always talking about,

26:02.274 --> 26:04.333
"Come in and air your grievances,"
right? So I did.

26:04.543 --> 26:06.443
- What did he say?
- You know what he says to me?

26:06.645 --> 26:10.411
He says I am incapable of writing
somebody up because I'm so friendly.

26:10.616 --> 26:13.881
And I said,
"Hey, give me a pen, Leonard, okay?

26:14.086 --> 26:16.418
I'll tell you everything
that everybody's doing wrong."

26:16.622 --> 26:20.023
What, Beth Ann, she take
way too long on her lunch break.

26:20.225 --> 26:24.491
Alan, that little shit down in Receiving
came to work the other day high.

26:24.696 --> 26:28.291
And Sally, just yesterday, came in with
this skirt with the discontinued line.

26:28.500 --> 26:31.094
Remember that, baby?
Remember that little skirt I had?

26:31.303 --> 26:33.271
And I know she didn't pay for it.

26:33.472 --> 26:36.930
He think I'm gonna take some kind of
blind eye to all of these violations

26:37.142 --> 26:40.634
if I was sales supervisor
just because I'm nice?

26:44.049 --> 26:45.277
Clyde?

26:56.261 --> 26:58.821
- Damn.
- What the hell you doing here, Djay?

26:59.031 --> 27:03.730
Hey, look here, baby. I know you about
sick and tired of seeing me right now,

27:03.936 --> 27:07.702
- but I just wanted to be able...
- Clyde. Who is it?

27:12.177 --> 27:15.635
- It's just...
- Just an old school buddy, ma'am.

27:15.847 --> 27:19.544
- From back in the day.
- Well, we was just having dinner.

27:19.751 --> 27:22.686
I'm so sorry, y'all. And I'd have
left them in the car,

27:22.888 --> 27:24.685
but this one right here, man,
she just

27:24.890 --> 27:27.381
sniff out an air-conditioning unit
like an old bloodhound bitch.

27:27.592 --> 27:30.755
Hey. Hey, man, respect my house.

27:30.963 --> 27:33.124
Look, man, anyplace you and me

27:33.332 --> 27:36.096
could just sit down
and talk for a minute?

27:36.301 --> 27:38.326
Djay, things don't always
come together

27:38.537 --> 27:41.165
just because you want them to,
all right, man?

27:41.373 --> 27:43.637
Look, just because you got the bacon,
the lettuce and tomato,

27:43.842 --> 27:47.107
hell, man, that don't mean
I'm gonna give you my toast.

27:47.612 --> 27:50.012
Look, man, I know you done learned
a whole mess of shit

27:50.215 --> 27:52.513
hustling out on the street, right?

27:52.951 --> 27:55.511
Let me tell you what I learned
while working on my job.

27:55.721 --> 27:58.246
- Thank you.
- There are two types of people:

27:58.457 --> 28:01.984
Those that talk the talk
and those that walk the walk.

28:02.194 --> 28:06.324
People who walk the walk,
they sometimes talk the talk.

28:06.531 --> 28:09.796
But most of the time, they don't
talk at all, because they walking.

28:10.736 --> 28:14.467
Now, people who talk the talk,
when it comes time for them to walk,

28:14.673 --> 28:17.107
- you wanna know what they do?
- What is that?

28:17.309 --> 28:19.300
They talk people like me
into walking for them.

28:19.511 --> 28:21.911
Look, I'm just asking you...

28:22.781 --> 28:26.649
Just listen to what I got here,
man, all right? Just listen to it.

28:26.852 --> 28:31.414
And if you ain't... If you ain't feeling it,
man, I'm out your life, okay?

28:41.666 --> 28:43.759
So can I get y'all anything?

28:45.470 --> 28:47.097
No, ma'am.

28:48.774 --> 28:51.208
Hey, I really like your hair.

28:51.610 --> 28:54.545
It's got some, like,
chocolate colors in it.

28:54.746 --> 28:56.805
Oh, thank you.

28:57.015 --> 28:59.506
I have this great guy that does it
over in Germantown,

28:59.718 --> 29:01.515
the coloring.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.779
- That sound all right.
- The whole time it's gonna have

29:03.989 --> 29:05.251
this thing going like:

29:08.827 --> 29:10.852
- Then I come in...
- When you gonna start a rhyme?

29:11.063 --> 29:14.430
Just gotta get my mode on, man,
just give me a second. All right.

29:14.633 --> 29:18.501
These bitches pop it for some paper
Pop that ass for some cash flow

29:18.703 --> 29:21.866
Do it like I like it
And I give you what you ask for

29:22.074 --> 29:23.701
I try and do my hair
every couple of months

29:23.909 --> 29:26.434
because it keeps the tricks guessing.

29:26.645 --> 29:28.806
- You know?
- I'm sorry, keep the what?

29:29.347 --> 29:31.508
Well, my hair has to be redone a lot

29:32.050 --> 29:34.917
because these ain't me real braids,
these just extensions.

29:35.120 --> 29:39.113
Nola, would you just
shut the fuck up, please?

29:39.324 --> 29:42.816
What makes you think this lady
care about your kitchen-ass hairdo?

29:43.028 --> 29:46.191
I think, you know what, it's nice.
It's okay...

29:46.398 --> 29:49.890
Lady, you don't got to be nice to her
because she's sitting on your couch.

29:50.102 --> 29:54.004
You think her hair look like a wet
dust mop, go on and tell her so. I do.

29:54.206 --> 29:57.004
- Damn, Lex.
- Well, I didn't. I mean, I don't.

29:57.209 --> 29:58.870
Lex, why you gotta be so ugly?

29:59.077 --> 30:01.375
Get a nigga minx
Grab her by the hand

30:01.580 --> 30:04.743
Take her back for some convo
Drop a couple grams

30:04.950 --> 30:06.884
Now you're back at the condo

30:07.085 --> 30:09.645
- Ugly as a swamp-duck ho.
- God!

30:09.855 --> 30:11.982
Everybody else
says my hair looks sexy.

30:12.324 --> 30:14.451
And then they nut.

30:16.761 --> 30:18.353
Clyde?

30:18.964 --> 30:20.454
Clyde?

30:21.133 --> 30:23.328
Real fast
Shake it, shake it real fast

30:23.535 --> 30:26.663
Put your hands on your knees
Shake it, shake it real fast

30:26.872 --> 30:30.308
Shake it, shake it real fast
Shake it, shake it real fast

30:30.509 --> 30:33.000

- No, man, I just...

30:33.211 --> 30:34.644
Clyde!

30:38.216 --> 30:40.047
What are you doing?

30:44.556 --> 30:46.114
Walking.

30:58.270 --> 31:01.967
I see you're down with that next nigga
Tryin' to make your chest bigger

31:02.174 --> 31:05.575
See you're down with that next nigga
Tryin' to make your chest bigger

31:05.777 --> 31:09.907
Working on your flex
Figure what? Nigga, fuck that shit

31:12.217 --> 31:14.549
Let's get this to work, Djay.

31:31.770 --> 31:34.136
The roadblock

31:34.339 --> 31:37.672
Got niggas jumpin' up
Tryin' to move the rock

31:37.876 --> 31:42.040
It's like all my days, I've been
hearing this beat in my head, man,

31:42.247 --> 31:44.442
like a pounding.
I mean, sometimes it's real raw,

31:44.649 --> 31:48.244
like a eightball joint, but then
sometimes, man, it get real soft,

31:48.453 --> 31:50.250
like Otis Redding and shit, man.

31:50.455 --> 31:52.355
And this beat, this pounding, man,

31:52.557 --> 31:57.654
that's what I been calling my mode,
this feeling. And, Key, if my mode

31:57.862 --> 32:00.626
is cracking, man,
it's like I can't be stopped, man.

32:00.832 --> 32:03.323
It's like I'm Mike, and it's showtime.

32:03.535 --> 32:05.969
Nigga, it's on, you know what I mean?
You know?

32:06.171 --> 32:07.934
Because, shit, when I'm out here
on this track,

32:08.139 --> 32:10.198
I gotta keep my game tight, man.

32:10.408 --> 32:13.866
Because it's hard out here
for a pimp, man. For real, man.

32:14.446 --> 32:17.074
Hold on, I like that, man.

32:18.350 --> 32:20.318
"It's hard out here for a pimp."

32:23.188 --> 32:25.986
Hot 107. 1. Big up to South Memphis
out there, checking in.

32:26.191 --> 32:28.159
I got your requests, and I got
that coming up for you.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.452
Keep your radios locked.

32:29.661 --> 32:31.754
This is messing with my mode.

32:34.165 --> 32:36.963
This is a bunch of bullshit, man.

32:37.736 --> 32:41.536
This is all I got
So I keeps it hot

32:42.274 --> 32:45.835
How I'm supposed to not?
Read your post to plot

32:46.044 --> 32:48.308
"Read your post to plot."

32:56.221 --> 32:58.485
Baby, this is some hard shit
right here.

32:58.690 --> 33:01.818
Trying to take what's
in your head, man,

33:02.027 --> 33:05.656
and put it into words that fit together
like a puzzle.

33:06.298 --> 33:07.697
So, you know...

33:07.899 --> 33:10.993
I wish there was something
I could do.

33:11.303 --> 33:13.601
You know, just...

33:14.372 --> 33:17.705
Shit, baby, you my whole operation.

33:18.677 --> 33:21.305
You might be what they call a...

33:22.013 --> 33:25.005
Like, a primary investor, you know?

33:25.216 --> 33:28.777
Making this shit happen
one trick at a time.

33:33.558 --> 33:36.755
- Hey, Nola.
- What?

33:37.996 --> 33:39.463
Remember when I first met you?

33:40.231 --> 33:44.759
Right where I found you at?
Remember, you was at the truck stop?

33:45.136 --> 33:48.731
Smallest little lot lizard I'd ever seen,
tricking them truckers for change.

33:48.940 --> 33:52.637
But you had balls, man.
Big gorilla balls.

33:53.745 --> 33:56.213
I got love for you, Nola.

33:57.315 --> 33:59.283
Big love.

33:59.818 --> 34:03.310
And I ain't talking about a way a man
love a woman or nothing like that.

34:03.521 --> 34:06.422
I'm talking about like a brother.

34:07.692 --> 34:09.556
Hey, do me a favor.

34:09.761 --> 34:12.456
I want you to put your hands
right here. Both of them.

34:18.603 --> 34:21.400
Now, I'm gonna put
my hands here too.

34:21.606 --> 34:23.972
Know what this means?

34:24.576 --> 34:26.271
What?

34:26.578 --> 34:28.978
It means we in charge.

34:30.547 --> 34:34.678
It means we got our hands
on the wheel. We in charge.

34:34.886 --> 34:37.821
Not them tricks out there, man.

34:38.022 --> 34:40.114
We in charge.

34:41.359 --> 34:43.725
I wanna hear you say it...

34:44.228 --> 34:47.630
...so I can believe in you
the same way you believe in me.

34:49.567 --> 34:51.626
We in charge.

34:52.237 --> 34:56.196
That's the best you can do?
Say it like you mean it.

34:57.342 --> 34:59.503
We in charge.

35:00.578 --> 35:01.943
You said you was all right with this.

35:02.313 --> 35:04.543
It's what you wanna hear, right?
So let's just drop it.

35:04.749 --> 35:07.343
No, Yevette.
I wanna hear what you really think.

35:07.552 --> 35:09.782
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

35:09.988 --> 35:11.148
You say that,

35:11.356 --> 35:13.984
but I know you wanna hear what you
want, so that's what I'm gonna say.

35:14.192 --> 35:16.490
I'm sick and tired of people telling me
what I'm thinking,

35:16.694 --> 35:18.127
like I don't know my
own goddamned mind.

35:18.329 --> 35:20.320
Don't you dare take that tone
with me, Clyde, okay?

35:20.532 --> 35:23.057
- I have supported you in everything...
- We already discussed this!

35:23.268 --> 35:25.930
All right, fine! I'm thrilled!
Okay? Thrilled.

35:26.137 --> 35:28.264
What woman wouldn't want
her husband spending all his time

35:28.473 --> 35:30.737
in a house full of ho's?

35:39.584 --> 35:41.848
What's all this shit again?

35:42.387 --> 35:46.585
Drink holders.
Poor man's soundproofing.

35:48.126 --> 35:50.458
So you ain't so dumb, huh?

35:52.564 --> 35:54.031
- D?
- What?

35:54.232 --> 35:56.826
There's someone at the door for you.

35:57.035 --> 35:59.128
Well, shit, baby, you know my rates.

36:00.438 --> 36:04.272
- I don't think he want no weed.
- Then wake Nola's ass up.

36:05.477 --> 36:07.707
- I don't think he want that either.
- Shit, man.

36:07.979 --> 36:10.243
We have to come up with some
fucking rules in this house!

36:10.448 --> 36:13.212
- Well, if you just tell me not to
- I wanna put a red light bulb up there

36:13.418 --> 36:15.886
- answer the door, that's fine with me.
- To say I'm working.

36:16.087 --> 36:18.021
- It ain't for me!
- Every time I'm fucking working,

36:18.223 --> 36:20.350

36:20.558 --> 36:22.389
Hey, man.

36:26.531 --> 36:29.523
You Mormons is some
brave motherfuckers.

36:30.368 --> 36:32.461
No, I'm Shelby.

36:32.670 --> 36:34.968
Okay, you Shelby.

36:35.874 --> 36:37.865
All right, look.
Hey, turntable's set up,

36:38.076 --> 36:41.011

has room for four inputs.

36:41.212 --> 36:44.238
- Cool. You got a power strip?
- Oh, we tight.

36:44.449 --> 36:46.280
How many outlets you need?

36:47.018 --> 36:50.385
- Three. I brought my MPC.
- Smart move.

36:50.588 --> 36:52.351
Hey, Key.

36:53.224 --> 36:55.920
Let me holler at you
for a second, man.

36:57.695 --> 37:00.528
- What's up, man?
- Who the fuck is this nigga, man?

37:00.732 --> 37:02.893
That's Shelby. He play piano
down in my church.

37:03.101 --> 37:07.128
You know, I figure we bring him in,
help him develop our sound.

37:08.606 --> 37:10.733
You know he white, right?

37:11.509 --> 37:14.273
No, he just light-skinned.

37:17.081 --> 37:19.311
Yo, peep. I got this shit right here
that...

37:19.517 --> 37:25.945
I keep this notepad
so that I can just jot down some shit.

37:26.591 --> 37:28.388
It's something...

37:30.662 --> 37:32.630
Get the fuck out of here, man.

37:36.267 --> 37:38.462
It go like this, man.

37:38.803 --> 37:41.772
Y'all sure y'all don't wanna, like,

37:41.973 --> 37:46.501
No, man. We can toke up later.
Let's hear what you got.

37:46.878 --> 37:50.279
Fine, man. I got...

37:51.282 --> 37:52.772
Okay.

37:56.421 --> 37:59.356
I bet you won't beat that bitch
Whoop that bitch

37:59.557 --> 38:03.618
Got me acting buck and shit
Ho's telling me to calm down

38:03.828 --> 38:05.022
But I'm like, "Fuck that shit"

38:05.229 --> 38:08.756
I'm already on that Hpnotiq
And that Grey Goose

38:08.967 --> 38:11.868
A couple of shots of Hen
That just gave me a...

38:12.070 --> 38:13.765
What the fuck wrong?
You don't like that shit?

38:13.972 --> 38:16.497
- No, D, look.
- I got other shit, man.

38:16.708 --> 38:20.371
- No, look... It's okay, man.
- I think that's tight.

38:21.079 --> 38:22.910
It's just that we want radio play, right?

38:23.114 --> 38:25.446
You got a song called
"Beat That Bitch,"

38:25.650 --> 38:27.447
they might hear that
and think that's degrading.

38:27.652 --> 38:29.347
But that's if you're calling
a woman a bitch.

38:29.554 --> 38:31.351
This sounds like a
tearing-the-club-up song.

38:31.556 --> 38:33.319
Man, I ain't trying to call no ho
no bitch.

38:33.524 --> 38:35.822
Yeah, I mean, besides,
most of the bitches I know are guys.

38:36.027 --> 38:37.892
Look, man, y'all preaching to the choir,
all right?

38:38.096 --> 38:40.758
If you had to say something different,
other than "beat that bitch,"

38:40.999 --> 38:42.296
what would you say?

38:42.500 --> 38:45.992
I don't know. Shit. Stuff like...

38:46.571 --> 38:48.698
"Stomp that ho."

38:48.906 --> 38:50.533
- Who gonna play that?
- Fuck.

38:51.643 --> 38:54.168
- Shit, "whoop that trick."
- No, no, no.

38:54.379 --> 38:55.403
- Go back.
- What?

38:55.613 --> 38:57.308
- "Whoop that trick."
- That's it.

38:58.883 --> 39:01.147
- Like what?
- Like a chant, man.

Speed it up. Speed it up.

39:36.788 --> 39:37.914
There you go.

39:43.828 --> 39:45.887
I like that clap.

39:57.942 --> 40:00.069

42:33.331 --> 42:37.529
Heavy percussion, repetitive hooks,
sexually suggestive lyrics.

42:37.735 --> 42:40.101
Man, it's all blues, brother.

42:40.304 --> 42:42.534
"Back Door Man" to
"Back That Ass Up."

42:42.740 --> 42:47.006
It's all about pain and...
And pussy.

42:47.211 --> 42:50.476
Sorry, baby. And making music, man.

42:50.948 --> 42:54.179
With simple tools,
by any means necessary.

42:54.385 --> 42:58.754
You've got to get what you got to say
out because you got to.

42:58.956 --> 43:00.685
Every man, you know
what I'm saying?

43:00.892 --> 43:06.728
Every man has the right,
the goddamn right...

43:08.266 --> 43:09.927
...to contribute a verse.

43:13.170 --> 43:15.638
- Number one for hip-hop. This
your man Boogaloo in the house.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.171
North Memphis,
throw your thumbs up.

43:17.375 --> 43:18.899
South Memphis,
let's get ready to kick it.

43:19.110 --> 43:20.975
I got this hot joint from my man,
Al Kapone.

43:21.178 --> 43:22.668
"Get Crunk, Get Buck." It's hot.

43:56.814 --> 44:00.773
- Do you just do music?
- Hey, man.

44:02.687 --> 44:06.179
Do you got, like, a regular kind of job,
a day job?

44:06.390 --> 44:09.291
Yeah, I got a job.
I restock vending machines.

44:09.493 --> 44:10.721
- Really?
- Yeah, you know,

44:10.928 --> 44:14.091
soda, candy, microwave popcorn.
All that shit.

44:14.298 --> 44:16.129
- That's cool.
- No, it's not cool.

44:16.334 --> 44:17.892
- Why?
- Because

44:18.102 --> 44:20.798
I gotta get up every day
at the crack

44:21.005 --> 44:23.303
and head out to all the truck stops
on the interstate

44:23.507 --> 44:25.099
before I head to the high schools.

44:25.309 --> 44:27.243
Yeah, I'm alone all day,

44:27.445 --> 44:32.075
and I smell like...
Like sticky buns and Skittles.

44:33.918 --> 44:36.250
I thought my job sucked, but...

44:42.760 --> 44:44.660
Hey, man.

44:45.196 --> 44:48.563
So this Skinny Black shit, that's real?

44:49.266 --> 44:51.791
Look, man, because even if he
does listen to what we got, man,

44:52.003 --> 44:54.369
we still don't know what he gonna do,
you know what I mean?

44:54.939 --> 44:56.406
It's a one-in-a-million shot, D.

44:56.607 --> 45:01.374
If I can pimp $20 ho's out the back
of this motherfucking Chevy,

45:01.579 --> 45:02.944
I can pimp Skinny.

45:03.748 --> 45:06.148
Nigga, you just get me
where I gotta be at.

45:06.350 --> 45:08.443
I'm telling you, this dog got him
some tricks, man.

45:08.953 --> 45:12.889
- You mean "old dog," right?
- I didn't mean it like that, man.

45:18.029 --> 45:20.691
My wife, man, she a...

45:21.632 --> 45:23.532
She a good woman.

45:25.803 --> 45:27.634
She feeds me.

45:27.972 --> 45:30.634
She get freaky on my birthday.

45:31.142 --> 45:33.975
- What she do?
- None of your business.

45:34.178 --> 45:37.113
But sometimes I feel, man, like...

45:38.649 --> 45:42.585
Like I talked such a good game
when we was young, man,

45:42.787 --> 45:46.245
about my own studio
and my own label that...

45:47.792 --> 45:50.784
Shit, Djay,
now I'm just paying rent, man.

45:55.232 --> 45:57.860
This shit right here, it gotta work.

45:59.403 --> 46:02.463
It gotta work, man,
because it ain't over for me.

46:16.020 --> 46:20.650
I am so sick and tired of you trying
to tell me what to do with my boy.

46:21.092 --> 46:24.152
That's my son! You go on and
have your little baby, then you can do

46:24.361 --> 46:25.988
- whatever you want!
- Lex, stop yelling.

46:26.197 --> 46:30.031
My pussy paid for this.
I should be mad.

46:31.135 --> 46:34.502
Lookie, lookie, who just decided
to waltz on in.

46:34.705 --> 46:37.071
Where the hell you been at, Djay?

46:37.274 --> 46:40.038
You know, I been standing outside
three hours.

46:40.244 --> 46:42.678
Finally just went on ahead,
took myself a taxi ride.

46:42.880 --> 46:44.074
Spent up all my little monies.

46:44.281 --> 46:47.682
So I really hope you ain't expecting
shit from me today!

46:50.454 --> 46:53.184
- Right back to your toys.
- You should go.

46:53.390 --> 46:55.950
You know what, Djay?

46:56.160 --> 46:59.994
You ain't never gonna be nothing more
than what you is right now,

47:00.197 --> 47:02.529
and that's my motherfucking
chauffeur.

47:04.068 --> 47:06.366
I make the money up in here.

47:06.570 --> 47:08.697
Know what? Matter of fact,
I think I feel like

47:08.906 --> 47:11.067
making me some money right now.

47:11.275 --> 47:16.212
Feel like popping my pussy,
maybe shaking my ass.

47:16.714 --> 47:20.741
Go on, boy. Go on, get my car for me.

47:20.951 --> 47:24.114
You heard me. Go on, now, little bitch.

47:25.789 --> 47:27.950
- What the fuck you just say to me?
- That's right, keep...

47:28.159 --> 47:31.788
- What the fuck you call me?
- Called you a motherfucking bitch!

47:31.996 --> 47:35.397
Now, do something about it, damn it!
Do something!

47:41.839 --> 47:43.670
You and me...

47:44.842 --> 47:47.072
...we done, okay?

47:48.245 --> 47:49.974
We done.

47:50.548 --> 47:52.345
You know what?

47:53.617 --> 47:56.313
We been done.

47:58.088 --> 48:01.785
And there you go,
running off to your little toys.

48:01.992 --> 48:04.552
Because you ain't nothing
but a little punk-ass bitch!

48:04.762 --> 48:08.721
- Lex, please back off.
- Just shut the fuck up!

48:08.933 --> 48:12.926
Wasted five years of my damn life
working in this piece-of-shit hole.

48:13.137 --> 48:15.332
So, what now? That's my shit!

48:15.539 --> 48:17.632
What, you just gonna
throw my stuff out?

48:17.841 --> 48:22.938
Oh, out the door! Hey, Djay!
You just leave my shit alone!

48:23.147 --> 48:26.844
I paid for that...
No! No! No!

48:27.051 --> 48:29.246
- I paid for this shit!
- Fuck! Come here.

48:29.620 --> 48:31.178
- Now!
- Djay, no!

48:32.223 --> 48:36.284
- Get the fuck off me! Get off me!
- No! No! Djay, no!

48:36.660 --> 48:38.491
Talk now!

48:39.830 --> 48:42.594
- Hey. Hey, come here.
- No, please, D.

48:42.800 --> 48:45.462
Let go. Let go.

48:47.004 --> 48:49.165
Come on. Come on.

48:54.712 --> 48:57.374
Where in the fuck do you
expect me to go?

48:59.483 --> 49:02.782
You can go to hell, all I give a fuck.

49:20.738 --> 49:23.536
Y'all make him pay!

50:42.386 --> 50:45.048
All right, man.
This is what I got so far.

50:46.957 --> 50:49.653
Man, it seems like I'm duckin'
Dodgin' bullets every day

50:49.860 --> 50:52.795
Niggas hatin' on me
'Cause I got ho's on the blade

50:52.996 --> 50:55.760
But I gotta stay paid
Gotta stay above water

50:55.966 --> 50:58.662
Couldn't keep up with my ho's
That's when shit got harder

50:58.869 --> 51:01.702
North Memphis, where I'm from
I'm Seventh Street bound

51:01.905 --> 51:04.703
Where niggas all the time
End up lost and never found

51:04.908 --> 51:07.877
These gals take me through things
Leave a big headache

51:08.078 --> 51:10.239
I'm hopin' every night
They don't end up being dead weight

51:10.447 --> 51:15.111
Hold on. Hold on, one second.
My bad.

51:15.319 --> 51:16.980
Baby.

51:17.187 --> 51:19.815
Look, I'm in a session right now,
all right?

51:20.023 --> 51:22.958
- What time you coming home?
- I can't give you that time.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.991
If I give it to you,
you're gonna hold me to that.

51:25.195 --> 51:28.631
- I don't see why you can't give a time.
- Because I'm not gonna do it.

51:29.666 --> 51:31.964
L... Look...

51:32.169 --> 51:35.605
If you just let me talk, I can be able
to tell you that I can't do it...

51:35.806 --> 51:38.400
Because I said so, that's why!

51:41.111 --> 51:43.511
You ready to work, lover-boy?

51:49.486 --> 51:53.013
Hey, Shelby,
bring that beat back, man.

51:53.223 --> 51:54.952
From the top.

51:55.926 --> 51:57.223
You know what? Just kill it.

51:57.428 --> 51:59.658
Fuck, man.
I got this flow I need to spit.

51:59.863 --> 52:01.854
Look, look, Djay.

52:02.132 --> 52:03.724
Now, we gonna have to make
a choice, man.

52:03.934 --> 52:06.368
Either we just gonna lay down
some freestyle freefall,

52:06.570 --> 52:08.060
or we gonna lay down a track.

52:08.272 --> 52:10.365
You know, something that's gonna
get us some radio play.

52:10.574 --> 52:12.633
I thought that's what we was doing
right here.

52:12.843 --> 52:15.209
No, no, no. What we doing
is a whole bunch of flow.

52:15.412 --> 52:18.438
That's all we doing.
And it just go on and on and on.

52:18.649 --> 52:19.775
Man, the shit don't ever stop.

52:19.983 --> 52:22.110
Yeah, D, what he's saying is that
we ain't got a hook.

52:22.319 --> 52:24.378
Well, shit, give it some hook, then!

52:24.588 --> 52:26.283
I mean, fuck, you the producer, man.

52:26.490 --> 52:29.084
You just tell me what
you want me to do, then.

52:29.293 --> 52:32.956
We need to lay down something,
Djay. Anything. Even if it's shit.

52:33.163 --> 52:37.862
And I keep telling you, I ain't putting
no shit on top of no shit, man.

52:38.068 --> 52:40.036
I ain't trying to sell no cash shit here.

52:40.237 --> 52:45.004
Well, that's the wonder of audiotape,
Djay. We can just record over shit.

52:46.176 --> 52:48.337
Go on, bring it back up, Shel.

52:48.846 --> 52:51.576
- Go on, bring it up!
- You need some ass, nigga?

52:51.782 --> 52:53.477
- What?
- Because I got a room full of pussy

52:53.684 --> 52:55.549
right in there for you.

52:57.621 --> 52:58.849
- Fuck you, Djay.
- Oh, fuck me?

52:59.056 --> 53:01.320
- Yeah, fuck you.
- No, no, fuck Yevette, man.

53:01.525 --> 53:04.323
Because she the one got your ass
wound up like a motherfucking clock.

53:04.528 --> 53:05.756
Look here, you dirt-rascal pimp,

53:05.963 --> 53:07.863
you keep my wife's name out
your mouth, you hear me?

53:08.065 --> 53:10.829
- Hey, guys, come on, keep it light.
- Sound like your wife,

53:11.034 --> 53:13.400
she the one need to put something
in her motherfucking mouth.

53:13.604 --> 53:15.367
- You know what I'm saying?
- Fuck you say, man?

53:15.572 --> 53:17.733
- You heard me, nigga!
- What the fuck you say, man?

53:17.941 --> 53:19.875
- That's what!
- Stop it, man! Sit down!

53:20.077 --> 53:21.601
- What?! What?!
- What's up, man?!

53:21.812 --> 53:23.939
Can you please stop it?
Do we have to do this?

53:24.147 --> 53:27.708
Can't we just smoke a joint,
for chrissake?!

53:27.918 --> 53:31.081
- Who is it?
- It's me, Shug.

53:31.288 --> 53:35.588
- Look, bitch, we working right now!
- I got something for you.

53:42.599 --> 53:44.760
Come on, man.

53:45.369 --> 53:47.599
Sorry to interrupt y'all's
recording session,

53:47.804 --> 53:50.637
but they had this interview
with Skinny Black on TV

53:50.841 --> 53:56.609
and look like he had one of these
in his studio where he uses,

53:56.813 --> 54:00.146
so I thought I'd go out
and buy you one.

54:00.651 --> 54:02.812
Y'all have fun.

54:21.972 --> 54:24.839
That's a bottom bitch for you.

54:25.742 --> 54:28.540
I mean, we got everything we need
right here.

54:28.745 --> 54:31.043
And all this stuff in this...

54:31.582 --> 54:35.541
This little-bitty space, man,
it just looks so much bigger now.

54:45.095 --> 54:47.689
I'm here trying to squeeze a dollar
out of a dime,

54:47.898 --> 54:50.628
and I ain't even got a cent, man.

54:52.102 --> 54:54.434
It takes time, Djay.

55:05.649 --> 55:07.981
Do y'all believe in omens?

55:12.222 --> 55:15.419
Okay, Shug, put your headphones on.

55:15.859 --> 55:17.986
- Move closer to the mike.
- Okay.

55:18.195 --> 55:19.560
Can you hear yourself?

55:20.464 --> 55:23.922
- Say something.
- Hello. Oh, yeah.

55:24.768 --> 55:26.030
Okay, Shug,

55:26.236 --> 55:28.670
what we need right now
is called a "hook."

55:28.872 --> 55:30.863
That's like the chorus of the song.

55:31.074 --> 55:34.908
Now, you're gonna be singing
what's on Djay's pad. Djay.

55:40.884 --> 55:42.283
All right, now.

55:42.486 --> 55:44.716

55:55.132 --> 55:58.932
Now, Shug, I got an idea
how this should go.

55:59.136 --> 56:00.899
Now, I suck,

58:44.401 --> 58:46.096
Hey, Shelby, close the door.
We need to work.

58:46.303 --> 58:49.761

59:51.234 --> 59:52.496
Yeah. What is that?

59:55.739 --> 59:58.071

01:00:02.646 --> 01:00:04.443

This day is really starting to fuck

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.417
Hey, man, R.L. Over here?

01:00:25.869 --> 01:00:28.633
R.L., look, man, I'm sorry
to disturb you and all.

01:00:29.205 --> 01:00:31.230
And I know you and me,

01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:34.774
we done had words in the past and
some of them weren't too friendly.

01:00:34.978 --> 01:00:37.344
But right now, man, I got some shit
taking place in my crib

01:00:37.547 --> 01:00:41.210
that just requires a little bit of
silence. You know what I mean?

01:00:41.418 --> 01:00:46.082
Now, I'd never demand of you,
I can only request...

01:00:48.992 --> 01:00:52.359
...with a gesture of neighborly
friendliness, you know what I mean,

01:00:52.562 --> 01:00:57.829
that you please, please consider
the mute button just for a spell, man.

01:01:01.905 --> 01:01:03.497
All right, man.

01:01:08.278 --> 01:01:10.644
- Stand by, everybody.
- Standing by.

01:01:12.582 --> 01:01:14.311
I'm standing by.

01:01:28.264 --> 01:01:31.165
You know it's hard out here
For a pimp

01:01:31.368 --> 01:01:34.098

With my eyes, I done seen
Some crazy things in the street

01:01:58.228 --> 01:02:01.095

Like taking from a ho don't know
No better, I know that ain't right

01:02:04.367 --> 01:02:07.063
Done seen people killed
Done seen people deal

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:10.000
Done seen people live in poverty
With no meals

01:02:10.206 --> 01:02:13.039
It's fucked up where I live
But this is how it is

01:02:13.243 --> 01:02:16.144
It might be new to you
But it's been like this for years

01:02:16.346 --> 01:02:19.008
It's blood, sweat and tears
When it come down to this shit

01:02:19.215 --> 01:02:22.116
I'm trying to get rich 'fore
I leave up out this bitch

01:02:22.318 --> 01:02:24.912
I'm trying to have things
But it's hard for a pimp

01:02:25.121 --> 01:02:27.851
But I'm prayin' and I'm hopin'
To God I don't slip, yeah

01:02:28.058 --> 01:02:30.117
You know it's hard out here
For a pimp

01:02:30.326 --> 01:02:31.418
You ain't know, nigga

Man, it seems like I'm duckin'
Dodgin' bullets every day

01:02:54.918 --> 01:02:57.716
Niggas hatin' on me
'Cause I got ho's on the tray

01:02:57.921 --> 01:03:00.822
But I gotta stay paid
Gotta stay above water

01:03:01.024 --> 01:03:03.788
Couldn't keep up with my ho's
That's when shit got harder

01:03:03.993 --> 01:03:06.723
North Memphis, where I'm from
I'm Seventh Street bound

01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:09.728
Where niggas all the time
End up lost and never found

01:03:09.933 --> 01:03:11.491
Man, these girls take me
Through things

01:03:11.701 --> 01:03:13.100
Leave a big headache

01:03:13.303 --> 01:03:16.101
I'm hoping every night
They don't end up being dead weight

01:03:16.306 --> 01:03:18.831
I got a snow bunny
And a black girl too

01:03:19.042 --> 01:03:21.738
You pay the right price
And they'll both do you

01:03:21.945 --> 01:03:24.743
That's the way the game goes
Gotta keep it strictly pimpin'

You know it's hard out here

01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:54.032
- Cut it. Cut it.
- What?

01:03:54.244 --> 01:03:56.644
Wait, man.
I got another verse, man!

01:03:59.983 --> 01:04:02.042
Djay, we need to talk, man.

01:04:02.819 --> 01:04:04.912
Look, I just want it to be perfect.
And this mike,

01:04:05.622 --> 01:04:07.522
it ain't shit.

01:04:07.724 --> 01:04:10.056
What the fuck wrong with it?
That shit record, don't it?

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:15.857
Djay, the mikes we using, they got
a wider pattern, D. They go flat.

01:04:16.065 --> 01:04:19.330
So when you start screaming,
man, they just distort and pop out.

01:04:19.536 --> 01:04:21.868
Man, nigga, I don't know shit
about none of that shit!

01:04:22.071 --> 01:04:24.062
All I know is that shit
in there was live, man!

01:04:24.274 --> 01:04:26.105
And every time I get
my motherfucking mode up,

01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:27.901
- you come and fuck with it!
- It ain't me.

01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:30.045
That shit, it ain't gonna
be live like that again.

01:04:30.246 --> 01:04:31.679
I don't give a fuck what mike I'm on!

01:04:31.881 --> 01:04:35.908
Djay, that shit was live in there,

01:04:36.152 --> 01:04:38.780
but it was also distorted, man.

01:04:39.956 --> 01:04:41.480
God!

01:04:42.692 --> 01:04:45.126
I just don't understand why
I gotta pay so much more money

01:04:45.328 --> 01:04:46.886
for that microphone right there

01:04:47.096 --> 01:04:52.363
when the one right next to it
look just like it but cost half, man.

01:04:52.569 --> 01:04:53.797
Let's do it this way, man.

01:04:54.003 --> 01:04:57.564
If I buy two of them, say you give
them to me both for $90.

01:04:57.774 --> 01:05:01.540
This is studio quality. It costs $250.

01:05:01.744 --> 01:05:04.235
Now, why would I sell you
two of them for $90 apiece?

01:05:04.447 --> 01:05:05.880
Just because of that statement, man,

01:05:06.082 --> 01:05:08.107
"The customer's always right,"
ain't you heard?

01:05:08.318 --> 01:05:10.513
Not in this case, sir, no.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.450
If you want quality,
you have to pay for it.

01:05:13.656 --> 01:05:18.025
Look, man, can't you cut me some
type of break on this stuff here?

01:05:22.932 --> 01:05:24.058
What was that?

01:05:25.401 --> 01:05:29.633
- What?
- I mean, what you looking at, man?

01:05:30.206 --> 01:05:32.697
- Nothing.
- Don't worry, Sparky, man.

01:05:32.909 --> 01:05:35.537
I ain't gonna pop or nothing like that.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.905
Look here, man.

01:05:40.116 --> 01:05:43.916
The thing is, that gal over there, right?

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.452
I got it in real good with her.

01:05:46.656 --> 01:05:48.817
I mean, she's my gal and all,

01:05:49.025 --> 01:05:53.121
but she don't necessarily
belong to me.

01:05:54.964 --> 01:05:56.329
You see, a gal like that, man,

01:05:56.532 --> 01:06:01.060
she the type of girl that wanna
shut them doors, lock them,

01:06:01.271 --> 01:06:04.968
see what type of specials
you got going on in the back.

01:06:05.808 --> 01:06:09.175
And me, I'm the kind of man that

01:06:09.379 --> 01:06:11.711
just walk out of here and
leave a girl like that behind

01:06:11.914 --> 01:06:17.147
because, like I say, she with me
and all, but she don't belong to me.

01:06:17.353 --> 01:06:19.321
Not necessarily.

01:06:19.822 --> 01:06:22.347
And maybe when she leaves...

01:06:22.959 --> 01:06:26.861
...she can take something that don't
necessarily belong to her neither.

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:31.799
It's like you say, man, you want
quality, you got to pay for that.

01:06:41.377 --> 01:06:43.038
Hey, gal.

01:06:44.881 --> 01:06:47.111
I need that microphone.

01:06:47.817 --> 01:06:48.784
Okay.

01:06:48.985 --> 01:06:51.146
I need you to go back there
and be friendly with him

01:06:51.354 --> 01:06:54.016
and bring that microphone
out with you, okay?

01:06:54.957 --> 01:06:57.187
No. No way.

01:06:57.393 --> 01:07:00.760
Nola, I need that microphone.

01:07:00.963 --> 01:07:02.624
Get it.

01:07:02.832 --> 01:07:05.027
Y'all be good, now.

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:31.449
Hey.

01:07:40.937 --> 01:07:41.904
Hey.

01:07:42.105 --> 01:07:45.006
- Don't ever do that to me again, D.
- What? I ain't...

01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:48.473
No, I ain't some fucking cash machine,
where you can get shit for free.

01:07:48.678 --> 01:07:50.305
Ain't like you was
in there sweating bullets.

01:07:50.513 --> 01:07:53.038
- I gotta have a say in what I do!
- You was in there for a minute.

01:07:53.249 --> 01:07:56.241
- I gotta have a say in what I do!
- Look, man, I was gonna give...

01:07:56.452 --> 01:07:58.420
I'm not gonna suck dick
every time you come up short!

01:07:58.621 --> 01:07:59.645
You got something for me.

01:07:59.856 --> 01:08:01.983
- Do you got something for me?!
- Fuck you, D.

01:08:02.191 --> 01:08:05.285
- Here, take it! You earned it!
- What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:08:05.495 --> 01:08:08.521
This is expensive motherfucking...
Hey, Nola, bring your ass...

01:08:08.731 --> 01:08:12.895
- I'm fucking out of here. I don't care.
- Nola! Don't you do this shit right now!

01:08:13.536 --> 01:08:16.232
Nola! Bring your ass here, man!

01:08:16.606 --> 01:08:18.904
Don't you ever walk away from me!

01:08:19.509 --> 01:08:22.636
We do what the fuck
we gotta do, man! By any means!

01:08:22.845 --> 01:08:26.406
Ain't that right?
We take care of our shit.

01:08:26.616 --> 01:08:28.106
You think I like this shit?

01:08:28.317 --> 01:08:30.046
You think I wanna
spend the rest of my life

01:08:30.252 --> 01:08:32.243
pimping your pimpled country ass?

01:08:32.455 --> 01:08:35.685
Well, not me! I fucking hate you.

01:08:35.992 --> 01:08:38.051
I hate this shit!

01:08:38.661 --> 01:08:40.026
D!

01:08:43.064 --> 01:08:46.501
Do you know what I do
in the back of them cars?

01:08:47.569 --> 01:08:49.470
Do you?

01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:51.264
Everybody's got something to do!

01:08:51.474 --> 01:08:56.639
Everybody's got something important
going on in their life but me, D!

01:08:56.845 --> 01:08:58.779
And I want something!

01:08:58.981 --> 01:09:01.609
- What do you want?
- I don't really know, but I want some...

01:09:01.818 --> 01:09:03.877
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

01:09:04.086 --> 01:09:08.147
- Tell me what the fuck you wanna do!
- Not this, D!

01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:22.368
You know what, man?
I just got you dressed all wrong.

01:09:22.572 --> 01:09:25.166
You know, bitch like you, man,
you need to have on

01:09:25.374 --> 01:09:26.568
one of them suits.

01:09:26.776 --> 01:09:29.301
Get you a mobile phone and shit.
Get an ear jack.

01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:30.671
Man, you gonna feel different.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.075
I'm gonna put you in some
new shoes tomorrow, man.

01:09:33.282 --> 01:09:34.340
And you gonna feel

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:37.348
- like you are in charge.
- D!

01:09:40.122 --> 01:09:42.818
I know when you're messing
with my head.

01:09:43.192 --> 01:09:44.988
Because I let you.

01:09:46.127 --> 01:09:49.495
Because sometimes my head
needs to be messed with.

01:09:51.734 --> 01:09:55.795
But right now, just don't.

01:09:56.572 --> 01:09:58.096
Okay?

01:10:04.213 --> 01:10:05.976
Okay.

01:10:21.531 --> 01:10:23.021
Hey, Shelby,
I need some high-hat, man.

01:10:23.232 --> 01:10:25.097
Give me some high-hat
up top, all right?

01:10:25.301 --> 01:10:27.030
Okay, man. This takes a little time.

01:10:30.206 --> 01:10:33.004
Look, it should come in right
after the kick. Right there.

01:10:36.512 --> 01:10:37.501
Yeah, that's it.

01:10:40.116 --> 01:10:43.176
- Try that bit.
- Keep hustlin'

01:10:45.187 --> 01:10:48.350
- Keep flowin'
- How that sound?

01:10:48.558 --> 01:10:50.423
Tell her to put some more dick in it!

01:10:50.626 --> 01:10:53.459
- Most gracious and heavenly Father,
- Okay.

01:10:53.663 --> 01:10:56.826
We ask that you bless this food...

01:10:59.135 --> 01:11:01.228
...and our home.

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.885
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:11:20.089 --> 01:11:21.522
My name is Yevette.

01:11:21.724 --> 01:11:25.319
I'm Clyde's... I mean, Key's wife.

01:11:25.528 --> 01:11:27.519
Oh, yeah. He in the back
with the rest of the fellas.

01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:29.698
They fitting to cut something.

01:11:30.099 --> 01:11:31.066
Cut?

01:11:31.267 --> 01:11:34.464
Well, I like that first one, but you don't.

01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:37.901
Well, I think you should
throw out your best ball.

01:11:38.107 --> 01:11:41.099
And to me, that's the second one.

01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:44.336
Okay. We gonna gab, or we gonna
do the damn thing? Which one?

01:11:44.547 --> 01:11:48.506
- Hey, let's beat that bitch, then, man.
- Hey, everybody.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.445
This here's Yevette, Key's wife.

01:11:54.423 --> 01:11:57.358
And look, she brought
everybody sandwiches.

01:11:59.662 --> 01:12:01.960
Yeah, yeah. There's...

01:12:02.164 --> 01:12:05.258
There's some dill sauce there
in the middle if y'all wanna dip.

01:12:05.468 --> 01:12:06.867
If you want.

01:12:08.437 --> 01:12:10.769
Hey, you know...

01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:14.566
...Key worked really hard
on this last one there,

01:12:14.777 --> 01:12:18.941
so you might wanna
just take a little listen to it.

01:12:20.349 --> 01:12:23.182
Oh, no. I don't wanna interrupt. I...

01:12:23.386 --> 01:12:28.915
- It's just dinnertime. I thought y'all...
- But I think we'd like for you to stay.

01:12:29.125 --> 01:12:30.717
Right, Key?

01:12:38.601 --> 01:12:40.159
Yeah.

01:12:43.472 --> 01:12:44.905
Okay.

01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:50.608
Look, this track here, man, this...

01:12:50.813 --> 01:12:53.748
This is my heart, man, so...

01:12:54.483 --> 01:12:55.973
Before I do my thing,

01:12:56.185 --> 01:12:58.380
put my mouth to this mike,

01:12:58.587 --> 01:13:03.047
I wanna bless it with a kiss
from my primary investor, all right?

01:13:05.394 --> 01:13:07.089
Come on, baby.

01:13:13.936 --> 01:13:15.665
Go on, girl.

01:13:23.412 --> 01:13:27.473
Hey, just like our primary investor,
that mike is hot.

01:13:28.284 --> 01:13:30.115
So kill them fans.

01:13:56.378 --> 01:13:57.504
Look, this is my life

01:13:57.713 --> 01:14:00.477
And it's a battle within
I gotta survive

01:14:00.683 --> 01:14:02.116
Even if I'm sinnin' to win

01:14:02.318 --> 01:14:05.185
And if I show no remorse
I'll reap the devil's reward

01:14:05.387 --> 01:14:08.049
He said he'd give me riches
But I'm lookin' for more

01:14:08.257 --> 01:14:11.249
When I was young
Witnessed my dad standin' for right

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.985
Black pride in him
Even though he passin' for white

01:14:14.196 --> 01:14:16.858
Took years from my life
Now I'm missin' the man

01:14:17.066 --> 01:14:19.933
Mom's on some other shit
And now I'm missin' the plan

01:14:20.136 --> 01:14:22.934
So I'm stuck
In this fuck-the-world mold

01:14:23.139 --> 01:14:25.733
All the lessons
To a young teen nigga was cold

01:14:25.941 --> 01:14:28.671
Then my pimpin' ass uncle
Put me up on the game

01:14:28.878 --> 01:14:31.608
It really ain't no love
It's 'bout this paper, man

01:14:31.814 --> 01:14:34.510
Put me in a position
Got me out on a mission

01:14:34.717 --> 01:14:37.413
Collectin' from the ho's
Turned me on about pimpin'

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:40.214
A nigga from Memphis
Dealin' with life as a struggle

01:14:40.422 --> 01:14:43.255
This is the gift I was given
So I just live by my hustle

01:14:43.692 --> 01:14:45.819
Keep hustlin'

01:14:46.328 --> 01:14:48.922
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

01:14:49.298 --> 01:14:52.290
Keep flowin'
Flowin'

01:14:52.568 --> 01:14:54.832
I'ma step my game up
And get what's coming to me

01:14:55.037 --> 01:14:57.597
Keep hustlin'

01:14:58.207 --> 01:15:00.767
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

01:15:00.976 --> 01:15:03.672
Keep flowin'
Keep on flowin'

01:15:03.879 --> 01:15:06.814
I'ma step my game up
And get what's coming to me

01:15:07.016 --> 01:15:09.143
We got to get this shit done
by the Fourth of July, man,

01:15:09.351 --> 01:15:12.184
because I got some people
I gotta slip this to.

01:15:12.421 --> 01:15:15.151
- Who do you know?
- You remember Skinny Black.

01:15:15.357 --> 01:15:18.554
I think I see a hater right there.
Hold up.

01:15:19.662 --> 01:15:21.721
Hey, there go Skinny Black, man!

01:15:21.931 --> 01:15:24.399
- "Skinny Black" Skinny Black?
- Yeah, I know who Skinny Black is.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.125
I've got all of his early stuff,
back when he was still good.

01:15:27.336 --> 01:15:29.236
Now, do you really know him,
or just know of him?

01:15:29.438 --> 01:15:32.532
I mean, he may not know me, because
we went to different schools and all.

01:15:32.741 --> 01:15:36.040
We went to different schools and all,
but, yeah, I know Skinny.

01:15:36.245 --> 01:15:38.179
But I'm here to let you know
you ain't taking shit,

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:39.847
because I'm running
this goddamn thing!

01:15:40.049 --> 01:15:43.212
You wanna make a dollar? Best get
your ass up here with that good shit.

01:15:43.419 --> 01:15:44.579
Those boys don't want
dirt weed.

01:15:44.787 --> 01:15:48.052
Me and him gonna be kicking it over
at Arnel's club on the Fourth of July.

01:15:48.257 --> 01:15:52.193
If I can pimp $20 ho's out the back
of this fucked-up Chevy,

01:15:52.661 --> 01:15:53.685
I can pimp Skinny.

01:15:53.896 --> 01:15:56.160
Now I'm just gettin' by
And it's fuckin' with me

01:15:56.365 --> 01:15:59.232
See others doin' big things
They was nothin' to me

01:15:59.435 --> 01:16:02.336
I'm seeing what I used to be
And it's lookin' legit

01:16:02.538 --> 01:16:05.234
Got my hands on some music
Started fuckin' with it

01:16:05.441 --> 01:16:08.137
Put it down hard
Then I started pumpin' to this

01:16:08.344 --> 01:16:11.211
I let some others get a dose
And they was nuttin' to this

01:16:11.413 --> 01:16:14.041
Let me check my connections
'Cause we go back in the day

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:17.014
Say they was lookin' for 'dro
Heard I was hustlin' hay

01:16:17.219 --> 01:16:20.017
Got me connin' my niggas
Spittin' game to my ho's

01:16:20.222 --> 01:16:22.952
This my opportunity
I feel like anything goes

01:16:23.158 --> 01:16:25.786
I was never supposed to see
The new millennium, man

01:16:25.995 --> 01:16:28.657
And I refuse
To let my dad die in vain

01:16:28.864 --> 01:16:31.560
So I give it my all
You feel my struggle and pain

01:16:31.767 --> 01:16:34.634
If you ain't feelin' what I'm spittin'
Trick, you lame to the game

01:16:34.837 --> 01:16:37.499
But the closest ones to me
Know I'm holdin' it down

01:16:37.706 --> 01:16:40.470
You gonna feel me one day
We gonna be hurtin' the town

01:16:40.676 --> 01:16:42.701
Keep hustlin'

01:16:43.545 --> 01:16:46.241
It ain't over for me
No, it ain't over for me

01:16:46.448 --> 01:16:48.916

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.720
Keep flowin'
Keep on flowin'

01:17:01.263 --> 01:17:04.755
I'ma step my game up
And get what's coming to me

01:17:52.915 --> 01:17:54.576
Thank you.

01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:04.281
Ain't you gonna be hot in your coat?

01:18:04.493 --> 01:18:06.461
No, this is good leather, man.

01:18:06.662 --> 01:18:08.789
The kind that keep you
at the temperature you wanna be at,

01:18:08.998 --> 01:18:10.488
know what I mean?

01:18:13.002 --> 01:18:15.334
See this thing right here?

01:18:19.074 --> 01:18:21.542
This was my daddy's watch.

01:18:23.145 --> 01:18:26.239
He used to work
for the school district and all...

01:18:26.715 --> 01:18:29.707
...fixing them buses all over town.

01:18:33.555 --> 01:18:34.886
Yeah.

01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:38.025
Every now and then, when I see
them buses go by today,

01:18:38.227 --> 01:18:39.854
I get all excited
because I say,

01:18:40.062 --> 01:18:43.156
"My daddy used to work
on that," you know?

01:18:43.432 --> 01:18:47.266
But, you know, after he'd been
there maybe about ten years or so,

01:18:47.469 --> 01:18:49.562
gave him this and...

01:18:50.205 --> 01:18:52.605
Kind of thought about burying
him with it, but then again I said,

01:18:52.808 --> 01:18:56.369
"Maybe not, maybe I should keep it
as an heirloom," know what I mean?

01:19:10.526 --> 01:19:13.620
- I got you something.
- What?

01:19:15.264 --> 01:19:18.700
Well, it's like, you know, I been
watching them videos and all.

01:19:18.901 --> 01:19:23.634
And it be like all them rappers,
they got some chain.

01:19:24.306 --> 01:19:25.773
So...

01:19:31.947 --> 01:19:33.141
Oh, shit.

01:19:34.483 --> 01:19:35.745
Yeah.

01:19:35.951 --> 01:19:38.613
You always talking about your name
being right and everything,

01:19:38.821 --> 01:19:43.053
so I thought people
could see how you like it spelled out.

01:19:43.258 --> 01:19:45.522
You know, with the J-A-Y.

01:19:48.363 --> 01:19:49.830
Damn.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.497
- This shit is perfect, man.
- Let me put it on.

01:19:59.608 --> 01:20:02.304
- I wanna see it.
- Okay.

01:20:07.015 --> 01:20:09.006
- D.
- What?

01:20:11.653 --> 01:20:13.985
I can't believe...
I get like this

01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:17.158
because I'm pregnant and everything...

01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:19.725
...but, you know,
letting me sing on the...

01:20:19.928 --> 01:20:23.091
On the demo and everything
like you do...

01:20:23.765 --> 01:20:27.701
...well, it just...
It made me feel real...

01:20:28.103 --> 01:20:30.162
Real special.

01:20:30.806 --> 01:20:32.364
And...

01:20:32.574 --> 01:20:36.169
I mean, I know y'all gonna
be moving on and moving up...

01:20:37.179 --> 01:20:39.477
...and y'all are gonna get
real good people to sing,

01:20:39.681 --> 01:20:42.878
you know, backup for you
and everything...

01:20:44.186 --> 01:20:45.881
...but I just...

01:20:46.955 --> 01:20:50.391
D, I need you to know
it meant the world to me.

01:20:52.661 --> 01:20:54.060
Come here.

01:20:58.967 --> 01:21:01.527
Thank you so much, D.

01:21:11.146 --> 01:21:13.706
Djay, come on, man,
you gotta be there at 9:00, right?

01:21:13.916 --> 01:21:17.647
Calm your ass down, man.
He gonna be there all night.

01:21:22.024 --> 01:21:23.821
I ain't scared.

01:21:27.396 --> 01:21:29.159
I know.

01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:46.878
- Come on, man.
- Wow, check it out.

01:21:47.482 --> 01:21:51.213
Okay, look here. Djay, I put some
extra demos in the car, all right, man?

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:52.853
In case they have
some label folk there.

01:21:53.055 --> 01:21:56.115
Hey, if they want CDs, they just
gonna have to hit us back on that.

01:21:56.325 --> 01:21:59.351
Man, I like that.
I need to get one of those.

01:21:59.561 --> 01:22:01.028
D.

01:22:02.164 --> 01:22:05.964
- You all right, man?
- You got your mode on, D?

01:22:08.003 --> 01:22:10.062
Hold up for a second.

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.426
Came to party tonight.

01:23:40.796 --> 01:23:43.924
What's happening with you, man?
Where your boy at?

01:23:44.132 --> 01:23:46.191
Over at the big table.

01:23:47.502 --> 01:23:51.802
- I don't see him, man.
- I'll take you over. You ready?

01:23:53.041 --> 01:23:56.010
Hey, let's get a drink first, man.

01:23:56.311 --> 01:23:58.404
All right, what the hell.

01:23:58.613 --> 01:24:02.913
- Hey, I see you packing tonight, huh?
- Do a bear shit in the woods?

01:24:03.452 --> 01:24:07.047
Hey, who the fuck is that?
Hey, who the fuck is that, man?

01:24:07.255 --> 01:24:11.851
Oh, man, I can't believe what my
goddamn eyes are seeing right now!

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:13.550
I'm gonna have
to get a Seeing Eye nigga

01:24:13.762 --> 01:24:16.526
just to tell me what the fuck
I'm looking at, man!

01:24:16.732 --> 01:24:18.859
Is it? Could it be?

01:24:19.067 --> 01:24:20.728
The one, the goddamn only...

01:24:20.936 --> 01:24:22.597
Skinny!

01:24:22.971 --> 01:24:24.302
- Is that you?
- Slobs!

01:24:24.506 --> 01:24:26.667
- Boy, you fat, black and nasty,
- My nigga.

01:24:26.875 --> 01:24:29.241
- Greasy ham-hock, chicken-eating,
- You Ethiopian poster boy.

01:24:29.444 --> 01:24:31.708
- Can't-see-your-own-dick,
- Middle Eastern stepchild.

01:24:31.913 --> 01:24:35.314
Ass-crack-longer-than-the-
M-l-S-S-l-S-S-l-P-P-I,

01:24:35.517 --> 01:24:37.348
fat, black, nasty bastard!

01:24:37.552 --> 01:24:40.112
- What's going on?
- Come here, nigga!

01:24:40.322 --> 01:24:41.914
- How's my nigga?
- Back in the day, nigga.

01:24:42.124 --> 01:24:43.614
- Yeah, that was it.
- Back in the day.

01:24:43.825 --> 01:24:45.122
Back in the motherfucking day.

01:24:45.327 --> 01:24:47.659
Bring your ass over here, man.
Let me get you a drink.

01:24:47.863 --> 01:24:49.728
A drink in your hand
and some pussy in your lap.

01:24:49.931 --> 01:24:51.796
Hey, I need that!

01:24:54.503 --> 01:24:56.494
You ready to go over?

01:24:57.305 --> 01:24:59.535
Hold... Hold up, man.

01:25:04.479 --> 01:25:06.003
Hey, man.

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.251
Skinny, I think
you know my man Djay.

01:25:22.597 --> 01:25:25.725
- Man, I don't know this nigga, man.
- Hey, baby, it's been a long time.

01:25:25.934 --> 01:25:27.925
No, it's cool, man. It's nice
to see you home again.

01:25:28.136 --> 01:25:30.195
Got all these folks telling me
I been gone too long.

01:25:30.405 --> 01:25:34.466
Like I'm coming back or something.
Like there's a back to get back to.

01:25:34.676 --> 01:25:37.440
I say, fuck!
Best place to keep Memphis

01:25:37.646 --> 01:25:40.080
is in my rear-view,
you know what I'm saying?

01:25:40.282 --> 01:25:42.113
You know what I'm saying,
whoever the fuck you is?

01:25:42.317 --> 01:25:43.375
You know what I'm saying?

01:25:43.585 --> 01:25:45.519
Hey, man, what's up
with your boy, man?

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.415
- Skinny.
- I don't need this shit.

01:25:47.622 --> 01:25:50.284
This is the man
I was telling you about.

01:25:53.428 --> 01:25:56.261
- Oh, this here the man?
- This here Djay.

01:25:56.465 --> 01:25:59.628
- You and me, we went to different...
- Djay like short-for-something DJ,

01:25:59.835 --> 01:26:02.827
or you mean like... that type of DJ?

01:26:04.506 --> 01:26:08.704
- No, man. It's just... It's just Djay.
- Man, every time I come to Memphis,

01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:12.175
my folks hooking me up with this
old dirt-ass weed out here, man.

01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.575
Like they grow it out the ass
of some redneck or something.

01:26:14.783 --> 01:26:17.650
But my boy Arnel here
say you slinging that killer.

01:26:17.853 --> 01:26:19.286
Is that real, or what?

01:26:21.356 --> 01:26:23.153
Baby, you be the judge for that.

01:26:25.494 --> 01:26:26.893
How much I owe you for this, man?

01:26:27.095 --> 01:26:29.120
Here now, seeing how friendly
you are to me

01:26:29.331 --> 01:26:31.856
and the fact we go back in the day,

01:26:32.067 --> 01:26:33.728
it's on me, okay?

01:26:34.202 --> 01:26:36.397
Well, go on ahead and have a seat,
my blood brother.

01:26:37.772 --> 01:26:41.799
Hell, yeah. Check this out here.
Smell that. Damn, boy.

01:26:42.010 --> 01:26:44.774
Boy, he wasn't playing around
with this here! I think I'm in love.

01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:46.470
You remember way back in the day

01:26:46.681 --> 01:26:49.707
when you used to be hustling
your tapes over at the drive-in, man?

01:26:49.918 --> 01:26:53.081
- What?
- Look at that ass, boy!

01:26:53.288 --> 01:26:57.520
God bless America in this
motherfucker! What's going on, baby?

01:26:57.726 --> 01:27:01.059
It's Independence Day!
It is Independence Day, right?

01:27:01.263 --> 01:27:02.821
You know, I got that up from...

01:27:03.031 --> 01:27:06.262
There's this little dude brought that
up from New Orleans, man.

01:27:07.235 --> 01:27:08.896
Me first! Me first!

01:27:53.315 --> 01:27:55.306
Hey, Skinny!

01:27:58.053 --> 01:28:00.453
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

01:28:03.191 --> 01:28:05.716
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

01:28:05.927 --> 01:28:08.020
What the fuck did you just say?

01:28:11.166 --> 01:28:13.999
I don't mean no disrespect and all.

01:28:14.302 --> 01:28:18.238
I just remember when your first
underground crunk

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.567
hit the motherfucking streets, man,

01:28:20.775 --> 01:28:23.835
that shit flew through Memphis
like a motherfucking typhoon.

01:28:24.045 --> 01:28:25.444
Y'all was there, man.

01:28:25.647 --> 01:28:28.878
Nigga couldn't even walk halfway
down the block without the pavement

01:28:29.084 --> 01:28:31.917
crumbling underneath his feet
because some cat was bumping

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.055
your shit
out the back of his Caddy, man.

01:28:35.523 --> 01:28:37.184
We just miss you, Skinny, that's all.

01:28:37.392 --> 01:28:40.486
Miss me? Get up, bitch.
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

01:28:40.695 --> 01:28:44.096
- Miss me? Nigga, I don't even...
- Fuck this nigga, man.

01:28:44.299 --> 01:28:45.630
So wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:28:45.834 --> 01:28:47.802
You trying to say
I can't cut it no more?

01:28:48.003 --> 01:28:50.471
Like I ain't the shit?
That's what you trying to tell me?

01:28:50.672 --> 01:28:53.869
- I ain't saying nothing like that.
- Then what the fuck is you saying?

01:28:54.075 --> 01:28:55.872
What is you saying, then?

01:29:01.082 --> 01:29:03.312
Dig this right here, man.

01:29:04.219 --> 01:29:07.347
One day, this whole motherfucking
place is gonna be gone.

01:29:07.555 --> 01:29:10.820
This club, this city, man.

01:29:11.026 --> 01:29:13.722
This whole U.S. Of A., man,
is just gonna turn to dust, right?

01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:17.198
And a whole new civilization
is gonna rise from this one.

01:29:17.399 --> 01:29:18.866
And they gonna start digging,
you know.

01:29:19.067 --> 01:29:21.126
They gonna dig up
the pyramids over in Egypt.

01:29:21.336 --> 01:29:23.270
They gonna dig up the Eiffel Tower,

01:29:23.471 --> 01:29:25.735
Statue of Liberty and the Empire State.

01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:27.874
But if a nigga
wanna know about me?

01:29:28.076 --> 01:29:29.805
Wanna know about Memphis?

01:29:30.011 --> 01:29:34.573
All they gotta do is find your
first underground tape, nigga.

01:29:34.783 --> 01:29:38.913
North Third Thugs. Motherfuck it,
man. That was the shit.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.681
You know, I cut that shit in my
own mama's laundry room, man.

01:29:42.891 --> 01:29:44.119
Boy, it was raw as hell,

01:29:44.325 --> 01:29:46.919
but I put everything I had
into that shit, man.

01:29:47.128 --> 01:29:50.859
Yeah, but see, to me that was a sign
of your genius, you know?

01:29:51.066 --> 01:29:55.469
See, because it's not enough
for a man to climb Mount Everest.

01:29:55.670 --> 01:29:58.036
You know, he gotta do that shit
with the least amount of tools.

01:29:58.239 --> 01:30:01.231
- It's about the man. One man.
- One man and his skills.

01:30:01.443 --> 01:30:04.173
Like the samurai say, "The sword is
only as powerful as its master."

01:30:04.379 --> 01:30:07.815
And it ain't the size
of the dog in the fight, it's the size

01:30:08.016 --> 01:30:10.246
- of the fight in the dog, nigga.
- Of the fight in the dog.

01:30:10.452 --> 01:30:12.317
- My nigga.
- My nigga. Shit.

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.545
You know, and I know
a nigga like you, man,

01:30:14.756 --> 01:30:16.621
a man gotta do
what a man gotta do, right?

01:30:16.825 --> 01:30:19.055
You know, sometimes a nigga
gotta surround himself

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:20.693
with a whole bunch
of motherfuckers

01:30:20.895 --> 01:30:24.296
that think they got a say
in who the fuck Skinny Black is.

01:30:24.499 --> 01:30:26.592
Yeah, they pimping me.
I ain't gonna lie about that.

01:30:26.801 --> 01:30:28.393
Gotta break bread with all these

01:30:28.603 --> 01:30:31.071
number-crunching motherfuckers,
man. It ain't like it used to be.

01:30:31.272 --> 01:30:33.763
Hey, baby, you ain't gotta explain
a damn thing to me, man.

01:30:33.975 --> 01:30:35.533
Because I'm always
gonna be here for you.

01:30:35.744 --> 01:30:39.475
Same way we was here for you
way back in the day.

01:30:39.681 --> 01:30:41.672
- Oh, man.
- He got a cassette tape.

01:30:41.883 --> 01:30:44.613
- Remember that?
- This nigga tripping, man.

01:30:44.819 --> 01:30:46.480
Man, look at this shit!

01:30:46.688 --> 01:30:50.146
Tigga, Slobs, you see what this nigga
got, man? My underground, man.

01:30:50.358 --> 01:30:53.327
Where the fuck you get this from?
I ain't even got no more of these left!

01:30:54.763 --> 01:30:57.960
Skinny, you got thousands of those
left in you.

01:30:58.333 --> 01:31:03.134
All you gotta do is just come back
home, man. Because we miss you.

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.505
Come home, man.

01:31:14.249 --> 01:31:16.274
You stand behind your product, nigga?

01:31:21.689 --> 01:31:24.214
Is a pig's pussy pork?

01:31:51.186 --> 01:31:53.746
I had this Mustang, right?

01:31:54.355 --> 01:31:57.381
Motherfucking tight-ass ride!
You hear me?

01:31:57.592 --> 01:31:58.991
Hood snout.

01:31:59.194 --> 01:32:01.185
- What the fuck is a hood snout?
- Maple dash.

01:32:01.396 --> 01:32:04.297
It's the goddamn hood come up,
like that from the sides,

01:32:04.499 --> 01:32:05.761
- like a fucking nose.
- Okay.

01:32:05.967 --> 01:32:08.435
- Hood snout, maple dash.
- Shit.

01:32:08.636 --> 01:32:11.196
You know what I mean?
Two-tone metallic monster

01:32:11.406 --> 01:32:14.136
- motherfucker, you know?
- I hear you.

01:32:14.342 --> 01:32:16.640
So I go to my lady's crib
over there in The Courts, right?

01:32:16.845 --> 01:32:18.904
- You had one in The Courts?
- I had one in The Courts.

01:32:19.113 --> 01:32:22.344
- You had one in The Courts?
- I had a few of them in The Courts.

01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:25.917
So, look, man, I go up in there, right?
I get my ugly on real quick,

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.953
come out, my ride is gone!
You hear me?

01:32:29.157 --> 01:32:30.647
- Gone in 60 seconds?
- Gone in 60...

01:32:30.859 --> 01:32:32.053
And I nut pretty damn fast,

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:35.991
so them niggas must've
took my ride like that! You hear me?

01:32:36.197 --> 01:32:39.860
So I call up my crew. I call my crew
up, I'm like, "Come pick me up."

01:32:40.068 --> 01:32:43.367
Because I know there's only one place
them niggas going riding in my car.

01:32:43.571 --> 01:32:45.198
That's motherfucking
Millbranch, man.

01:32:45.406 --> 01:32:48.933
Millbranch. Millbranch, right?

01:32:49.410 --> 01:32:51.275
So we go down to Millbranch,
and we wait.

01:32:51.479 --> 01:32:55.848
And sure enough, just like I said,
not even an hour go by,

01:32:56.050 --> 01:32:58.177
and these niggas
coming in my ride, right?

01:32:58.386 --> 01:33:00.980
So we roll up in front. We box them in.

01:33:01.222 --> 01:33:02.655
Next thing you know,
20 motherfuckers

01:33:02.857 --> 01:33:05.121
come rushing at these niggas,
pulling them out of my car.

01:33:05.326 --> 01:33:06.987
I'm just screaming
like a little bitch, like,

01:33:07.195 --> 01:33:09.288
"Don't touch my car!
Don't touch my car!"

01:33:09.497 --> 01:33:12.728
Tripping, man. I can sit back
and laugh about it now,

01:33:12.934 --> 01:33:15.994
but goddamn it, it wasn't funny then.
You hear me? At all.

01:33:16.204 --> 01:33:19.765
You know, I'm sitting here
listening to you, man.

01:33:19.974 --> 01:33:22.966
And you ain't bragging and shit,
man, you just telling me how it is

01:33:23.177 --> 01:33:25.873
being on the side of the moon
that you see from.

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.014
And I realize a nigga like me ain't...

01:33:28.216 --> 01:33:30.878
I ain't but a slice of cheese
off your motherfucking cracker, man.

01:33:31.085 --> 01:33:33.519
- Right.
- You know...

01:33:34.622 --> 01:33:37.090
...but I got this thing right here.

01:33:37.292 --> 01:33:39.089
My motherfucking heart
beats in this thing, man.

01:33:39.294 --> 01:33:40.989
Fuck I'm gonna do
with a cassette tape, man?

01:33:41.195 --> 01:33:44.096
See, that's my blood pumped
in this shit, man.

01:33:44.299 --> 01:33:45.994
Dog, do you know it's
a new millennium, nigga?

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.861
I can't do nothing
with no cassette tape.

01:33:48.069 --> 01:33:49.730
I don't even have
a cassette-tape player.

01:33:49.938 --> 01:33:52.304
- What the fuck is this shit here?
- I ain't trying to play you.

01:33:52.507 --> 01:33:55.442
I appreciate the fact you talking
to me man-to-man like this and shit.

01:33:55.643 --> 01:33:57.838
Hell, treating me like an equal, man.

01:33:58.046 --> 01:34:01.641
And the only reason I give you
that right there is because...

01:34:01.849 --> 01:34:04.079
...you know, you and me,
we come from the same place,

01:34:04.285 --> 01:34:06.480
- you know what I mean?
- Right. That's the truth, man.

01:34:06.688 --> 01:34:09.782
- Hell, we old friends, man.
- Definitely. Definitely old friends, man.

01:34:09.991 --> 01:34:12.186
And I'm gonna tell you something.

01:34:12.393 --> 01:34:13.485
I miss you, Jay.

01:34:14.062 --> 01:34:17.259
- Man, it's Djay, man!
- Djay.

01:34:17.465 --> 01:34:19.365
- Djay, man!
- Djay, my bad, nigga.

01:34:19.567 --> 01:34:21.296
- My bad. Djay, Djay.
- Djay.

01:34:21.502 --> 01:34:24.596
You know, in real life, man,

01:34:24.872 --> 01:34:28.638
you know, if you give me a shot...

01:34:29.377 --> 01:34:31.208
...you know, just...

01:34:31.412 --> 01:34:34.643
Just give me a chance
to get my voice heard, man,

01:34:34.849 --> 01:34:36.908
you know, I wouldn't...

01:34:38.152 --> 01:34:40.313
I think I wouldn't even have words
for that shit, man.

01:34:41.356 --> 01:34:43.984
Let me tell you something, man.
Look here.

01:34:44.192 --> 01:34:46.285
- Got something I wanna tell you.
- Shit, he getting up.

01:34:46.494 --> 01:34:48.325
- Don't get up.
- Listen to me, this is important.

01:34:48.529 --> 01:34:50.360
Now, this is serious. Look at me.

01:34:50.565 --> 01:34:52.396
Look at me, man.

01:34:53.101 --> 01:34:54.966
- Okay, man.
- You laughing, this shit ain't funny.

01:34:55.169 --> 01:34:57.399
- I'm serious, now.
- Okay, I'm with you.

01:34:57.605 --> 01:35:00.574
Everybody gotta have a dream, boy.

01:35:00.775 --> 01:35:04.040
Everybody got to have a dream.
You hear me?

01:35:04.245 --> 01:35:06.475
I hear you, man.

01:35:06.814 --> 01:35:09.282
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Don't make... Don't fall, man!

01:35:09.484 --> 01:35:11.577
I can't help you, man.

01:35:13.788 --> 01:35:15.449
Where the bathroom at?

01:35:15.656 --> 01:35:18.056
Nigga, over there, man. Go get it.

01:35:19.093 --> 01:35:20.458
Hey.

01:35:20.661 --> 01:35:24.722
Hey, hey, man.
You better help your nigga, man.

01:35:39.881 --> 01:35:41.508
Thank you.

01:35:45.053 --> 01:35:46.816
- I didn't think it was going in.
- How'd it go?

01:35:47.021 --> 01:35:48.921
Played it like a pro, man.

01:35:49.123 --> 01:35:50.613
My mode is just...

01:35:50.825 --> 01:35:52.884
Just pounding in my head now.

01:35:53.094 --> 01:35:54.186
I mean, and it's...

01:35:54.395 --> 01:35:56.625
It's hard in my heart right now.

01:35:57.331 --> 01:35:59.265
All that boy gotta do is just
play the damn thing,

01:35:59.467 --> 01:36:03.369
and it's gonna be undeniable, man.
Undeniable, baby.

01:36:06.774 --> 01:36:10.733
I think you gonna have to get your
weed from some other hustler, man.

01:36:11.712 --> 01:36:15.443
You're on your way.
You're on your way.

01:36:18.653 --> 01:36:20.518
Hey...

01:36:22.090 --> 01:36:24.149
...I got something for you.

01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:31.928
Thank you for everything, man.

01:36:34.402 --> 01:36:36.836
Let me get my jacket, man.

01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:44.203
I'm gonna take me a piss,
and I'm gonna roll, baby.

01:36:44.412 --> 01:36:46.505
You take care of yourself.

01:36:46.714 --> 01:36:51.310
I will. Next time you see me, man,
I'm gonna be 100 feet tall, man.

01:37:12.173 --> 01:37:14.266
Talking all this...

01:37:14.475 --> 01:37:16.568
Shit, I can't...

01:37:18.412 --> 01:37:20.972
Nigga talking to me.
I don't care about that shit, man.

01:37:21.182 --> 01:37:23.446
Hey, Skinny, man.

01:37:23.651 --> 01:37:26.085
You need to take a piss?

01:37:26.287 --> 01:37:28.050
Hey, baby, let's try this shit
standing up.

01:37:28.256 --> 01:37:29.223
Come on, man. Come on.

01:37:29.423 --> 01:37:32.483
- Now, don't try...
- Come on. Big motherfucker.

01:37:32.693 --> 01:37:34.991
Nigga talking to me
about his bullshit.

01:37:35.196 --> 01:37:37.426
Nigga, I'm talking to you, man.

01:37:37.632 --> 01:37:41.329
I'm talking to you, dog. You need
a little help, okay? Stay with me here.

01:37:41.836 --> 01:37:44.896
I'm gonna pull your pants up, nigga.
I ain't no faggot or nothing.

01:37:45.106 --> 01:37:47.438
You know, shit, ain't too many men

01:37:47.642 --> 01:37:50.702

01:37:51.345 --> 01:37:53.745
You better show me some love
for this one, man.

01:37:53.948 --> 01:37:55.813
You know, one day...

01:37:56.017 --> 01:37:57.985
One day, you and me
gonna be on tour, man.

01:37:58.186 --> 01:37:59.983
- I ain't gonna do this shit for you.
- Tour?

01:38:00.188 --> 01:38:01.815
- What tour you taking about?
- Shit, man.

01:38:02.023 --> 01:38:03.217
Man, you know, a fucked-up nigga

01:38:03.424 --> 01:38:06.086

01:38:06.294 --> 01:38:09.229
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:11.830
Come on, baby.
Let's get the fuck up...

01:39:00.915 --> 01:39:03.145
Hey, Skinny, man.

01:39:03.718 --> 01:39:07.518
You tell me this shit
just fell out your pocket, man.

01:39:11.859 --> 01:39:13.383
Skinny?

01:39:13.594 --> 01:39:15.027
Hey, bitch.

01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:17.026
You tell me this shit fell out
your pocket, man.

01:39:17.231 --> 01:39:20.098
- Hey, hey, hey, man.
- Hey, what, man?

01:39:20.301 --> 01:39:22.292
You know what you could do?

01:39:22.503 --> 01:39:26.098
What can I do, man?
You tell me what I can do, man.

01:39:27.041 --> 01:39:30.499
You can suck my dick, bitch.

01:39:30.711 --> 01:39:33.908
Hey, bitch, why don't you
suck on this shit? Motherfucker!

01:39:44.592 --> 01:39:46.116
This what the fuck you want, man?

01:39:46.327 --> 01:39:48.693
This what the fuck you want, man?

01:39:54.969 --> 01:39:56.903
Oh, shit.

01:40:03.144 --> 01:40:04.475
Oh, God.

01:40:04.679 --> 01:40:07.546
Oh, Skinny, man.
Hey. Hey, nigga.

01:40:07.748 --> 01:40:10.683
Hey, Skinny! Hey, Skinny,

01:40:10.885 --> 01:40:13.217
Skinny, come on, man!
Come on, man. Come on, nigga.

01:40:13.421 --> 01:40:15.753
Breathe, you motherfucker!

01:40:15.956 --> 01:40:18.015
Hey, yo, Skin...

01:40:18.993 --> 01:40:20.585
Shit!

Get the fuck up! Get your ass up!

01:40:24.031 --> 01:40:25.999
Get your ass up, motherfucker!

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:27.690
- Oh, shit!
- Hey, motherfuckers,

01:40:27.902 --> 01:40:28.869
I'm coming out now!

01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:30.935
If I see any gleam, motherfuckers,

01:40:31.138 --> 01:40:32.901
I'm gonna shoot this motherfucker
in his head!

01:40:33.107 --> 01:40:34.199
- Shoot this nigga!
- Get him!

01:40:34.408 --> 01:40:35.898
- Shoot this nigga!
- Fuck off, bitch!

01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:37.737
Hey, niggas, back the fuck up!

01:40:37.945 --> 01:40:40.846
- Not tonight, nigga! Not tonight!
- Shoot him! Shoot him!

01:41:24.859 --> 01:41:26.292
There he is!
There that motherfucker go!

01:41:26.494 --> 01:41:27.825
- Right there!
- Away from the door.

01:41:28.028 --> 01:41:30.155
Hey, man, I ain't armed.
It's in the glove.

01:41:30.364 --> 01:41:33.299
- It's in the glove, man.
- Djay! Djay!

01:41:33.501 --> 01:41:35.526
Hey, wait, man! Hey, Shug, it's okay.
Hey, wait!

01:41:35.936 --> 01:41:37.233
- Hey, get off my foot, man.
- Djay!

01:41:37.438 --> 01:41:38.405
Hey lay off my foot, man!

01:41:38.606 --> 01:41:40.403
- Fuck you, man! Hey, man!
- Get down on the car!

01:41:40.608 --> 01:41:44.169
- Hey, get them off my girl!
- Hey, get your hands off her!

01:41:44.378 --> 01:41:45.777
Hey, man!

01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:47.811
- Fuck!
- What the fuck's up now, nigga?

01:41:48.015 --> 01:41:50.575
- Bust his motherfucking head, man.
- Nigga, come on, come on.

01:41:50.785 --> 01:41:52.616
Djay, please, what did you do?

01:41:53.053 --> 01:41:55.419
Hey, man! Come on, man!
He turned himself in, man!

01:41:55.890 --> 01:41:58.324
You ain't gotta dog-pile
on him like that!

01:41:58.526 --> 01:42:00.858
Hey, yo, she pregnant, man!

01:42:01.829 --> 01:42:03.694
Don't forget, man,
you knock this motherfucker out.

01:42:03.898 --> 01:42:06.628
He's gonna have to come around here.

01:42:06.967 --> 01:42:09.527
Djay, tell me what to do, please.

01:42:09.737 --> 01:42:12.103
Please tell me what to do.

01:42:12.306 --> 01:42:14.365
Baby, take my pad.

01:42:15.075 --> 01:42:17.737
I want you to get that shit up
on the radio.

01:42:17.945 --> 01:42:20.607
You put it in the DJ's hand
yourself, you hear me?

01:42:20.815 --> 01:42:21.839
- Okay, I will.
- Get him up.

01:42:22.049 --> 01:42:24.415
I got a stack of demos
right there in the car.

01:42:24.618 --> 01:42:28.179
I want you to get Key and them...
Key, y'all put my shit on CD!

01:42:28.389 --> 01:42:29.378
All right, man!

01:42:30.424 --> 01:42:32.221
Nola, you in charge and shit,
all right?

01:42:32.426 --> 01:42:35.418
In two weeks, I wanna hear my shit
in the yard at 2:01, you hear me?

01:42:37.198 --> 01:42:39.792
- Get him!
- Motherfucker!

01:42:41.268 --> 01:42:44.328
- Bitch!
- Don't hit him like that!

01:42:45.139 --> 01:42:48.165
Get him! Bitch!

01:42:48.375 --> 01:42:49.603
D!

01:42:51.312 --> 01:42:53.746
I wanna hear my shit in the yard,
you hear me.

01:42:53.948 --> 01:42:56.007
You in charge.
I wanna hear you say that.

01:42:56.217 --> 01:42:57.844
- Say it!
- I'm in charge.

01:42:58.052 --> 01:42:59.451
- You my partner.
- I know.

01:42:59.653 --> 01:43:02.918
- Say, "I'm in charge!"
- I'm in charge!

01:43:06.393 --> 01:43:08.258
- All right, man.
- Get in the car.

01:43:08.596 --> 01:43:09.722
Watch your head.

01:43:09.930 --> 01:43:12.057
I'm in charge.

01:43:12.266 --> 01:43:13.392
Me. I promise.

01:43:31.452 --> 01:43:33.682
Go get down in the yard.

01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:12.516
I tried calling the house, you know...

01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:16.489
...but the phone's just...
- They shut them off.

01:44:18.966 --> 01:44:21.298
But me and Yevette, we...

01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:23.432
We chipping in.

01:44:23.771 --> 01:44:25.398
Thank you.

01:44:32.846 --> 01:44:35.144
She precious, man.

01:44:36.450 --> 01:44:38.247
Beautiful little girl.

01:44:41.989 --> 01:44:44.549
- Named her Keisha.
- Keisha.

01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.424
That's a good handle, man.

01:44:48.696 --> 01:44:50.391
I like that.

01:44:51.966 --> 01:44:53.957
You know, with all I gotta do...

01:44:54.635 --> 01:44:57.661
...all these people in my life, man...

01:44:59.707 --> 01:45:02.335
...feels like an eternity in here.

01:45:03.577 --> 01:45:06.410
Can't seem to find my mode now.

01:45:07.014 --> 01:45:09.312
Don't hear a damn thing.

01:45:11.118 --> 01:45:12.745
Djay...

01:45:18.158 --> 01:45:21.093
...did you know Skinny Black
before that night?

01:45:28.769 --> 01:45:31.567
You know that
little girl Keisha, right?

01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:35.238
One day she gonna dream big,

01:45:35.442 --> 01:45:37.967
the way kids do, you know.

01:45:38.345 --> 01:45:41.837
And she gonna come to me
and ask me

01:45:42.049 --> 01:45:46.076
when she grow up,
can she become president?

01:45:47.154 --> 01:45:51.022
Now, I know that little girl got a ho
for a mama and a trick for a daddy,

01:45:51.225 --> 01:45:53.819
that nobody even know where he at.

01:45:54.795 --> 01:45:56.888
But I tell you something.

01:45:57.998 --> 01:46:00.364
I'm gonna look her right in the eye...

01:46:01.201 --> 01:46:03.260
...and I'm gonna lie.

01:46:04.004 --> 01:46:06.802
Because sometimes
that's what you gotta do.

01:46:17.184 --> 01:46:19.618
How you been doing, man?

01:46:24.391 --> 01:46:26.791
Back to the same old shit.

01:46:26.994 --> 01:46:30.930
About six months ago,
my neighbor brought my mail.

01:46:31.131 --> 01:46:34.157
It was mail that she'd gotten
from her neighbor.

01:46:34.368 --> 01:46:35.858
It was addressed to me.

01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:39.836
The court depositions
and the high school recitals.

01:46:41.308 --> 01:46:43.708
Talk about eternity, man.

01:46:44.745 --> 01:46:47.043
It's been on my mind too.

01:46:49.583 --> 01:46:52.108
It's on all our minds.

01:46:52.319 --> 01:46:54.981
We was just dead, Djay.

01:46:55.522 --> 01:46:58.047
Locked up, just like you.

01:46:59.793 --> 01:47:03.627
But ain't no sorrow gonna
take away Shug's song.

01:47:03.831 --> 01:47:05.822
Let me tell you that.

01:47:06.066 --> 01:47:08.728
That woman, she got love for you.

01:47:09.937 --> 01:47:12.565
So when you talk about eternity...

01:47:13.774 --> 01:47:15.969
...you think about your woman.

01:47:18.912 --> 01:47:21.403
- Hey, how's Nola, man?
- Nola?

01:47:22.583 --> 01:47:25.245
Let me tell you something, man.

01:47:25.919 --> 01:47:28.683
That girl got a mode all her own.

01:47:35.929 --> 01:47:37.897
She hit the bricks running.

01:47:38.098 --> 01:47:41.795
For some reason, she got it stuck
in her head that she was in charge.

01:47:42.002 --> 01:47:47.372
We can't lay around licking our ass
all day like a dog, you know?

01:47:47.574 --> 01:47:50.168
I mean, we man.

01:47:50.377 --> 01:47:55.246
I mean, I know I'm a girl and all,
but we mankind.

01:47:55.916 --> 01:47:57.816
Man, she hit every shake joint,

01:47:58.018 --> 01:48:01.317
radio station in Memphis
and then some.

01:48:01.555 --> 01:48:03.386
I don't know how she did it.

01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:06.150
That girl got skills.

01:48:18.472 --> 01:48:20.406
Power 107. 1.
Number one for hip-hop.

01:48:20.607 --> 01:48:22.370
This your man Boogaloo
holding you down.

01:48:22.576 --> 01:48:25.545
Man, I got a brand-new exclusive
from my man Djay.

01:48:25.746 --> 01:48:28.874
Straight from the north, north, north.
Put your thumbs up out there, man.

01:48:29.082 --> 01:48:31.346
And I hear my man Djay...
Djay, you gotta call me,

01:48:31.552 --> 01:48:34.715
let me know if it's true.
Did you slap Skinny Black?

01:48:34.922 --> 01:48:36.116
Did you do it, man?

01:48:36.323 --> 01:48:38.052
Holler at me, man.
Power 107. 1.

01:48:38.258 --> 01:48:39.987
Brand-new, right here.

01:48:41.628 --> 01:48:44.188
Hey, man, this is me!
I made this beat!

01:48:49.169 --> 01:48:52.002
Whoop that trick
Whoop that trick

01:48:52.206 --> 01:48:54.970
Whoop that trick
Whoop that trick

01:48:58.612 --> 01:49:00.011
Whoop that trick

01:49:01.982 --> 01:49:05.179
Whoop that trick
Whoop that trick

01:49:07.487 --> 01:49:10.820
So if you don't mind,

01:49:11.024 --> 01:49:12.423
Nola and I, we got a few points

01:49:12.626 --> 01:49:15.891
we'd like to talk about
in regards to your agenda.

01:49:17.197 --> 01:49:19.028
That's if you got a minute.

01:49:23.770 --> 01:49:25.761
For you, Key...

01:49:25.973 --> 01:49:28.134
...I got 11 months.

01:49:48.896 --> 01:49:51.387
Hey, Al, hold up, hold up.

01:49:51.598 --> 01:49:54.066
Ain't this the guy on the radio with
that "Whoop That Trick" song?

01:49:54.268 --> 01:49:55.895
- What you talking about?
- Man, this the cat

01:49:56.103 --> 01:49:58.537
who stomped on Skinny
with that "Whoop That Trick" song.

01:49:58.739 --> 01:49:59.831
You know that song.

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:03.134

- Whoop that trick, get 'em

01:50:03.343 --> 01:50:04.742

01:50:09.783 --> 01:50:10.943
Yeah, man.

01:50:11.151 --> 01:50:12.880
Look, man.

- Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

01:50:15.722 --> 01:50:18.589
We got it going on both sides
of the law, being from the streets

01:50:18.792 --> 01:50:20.123
and being officers of the law.

01:50:20.327 --> 01:50:22.124
You know what I'm saying?
Our stage name, Five-0.

01:50:22.329 --> 01:50:24.263
They call me Big Five-0.

01:50:24.464 --> 01:50:25.931
