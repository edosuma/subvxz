01:26.251 --> 01:28.420
Yeah, who is it?

01:29.221 --> 01:32.292
<i>Esteban!
¿Como estas, hermano?</i>

01:33.159 --> 01:35.862
Yeah, I'm just drivin' back
from the ranch.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.498
Got everything handled
with all the business.

01:38.531 --> 01:40.633
Everything's a go.

01:43.468 --> 01:45.437
Yeah?

01:45.471 --> 01:47.439
<i>Come on, hermano,
I don't like surprises,</i>

01:47.472 --> 01:49.608
and I don't want no birthday
gifts, man.

01:49.641 --> 01:54.246
I'm frickin' in my 40s. I don't
need a damn surprise party, man.

01:58.183 --> 02:02.155
<i>I just want to... Hey, this month
is about makin' la feria, man.</i>

02:02.188 --> 02:04.356
Forget about it.
Just tell everybody to cancel.

02:04.390 --> 02:07.192
I don't want a birthday party,
man.

02:11.663 --> 02:13.632
Okay.

02:14.532 --> 02:16.668
Okay, okay.

02:43.729 --> 02:46.232
Esteban.

02:46.264 --> 02:47.733
<i>Mija.</i>

02:49.168 --> 02:52.471
What are you guys doing?
What kind of party is this?

02:56.442 --> 03:01.247
<i>Esteban, mija, you could've gotten
rid of some of these candles,</i>

03:01.280 --> 03:03.650
at least put them out!

03:07.385 --> 03:09.722
<i>Chingao, that's pretty good.</i>

03:10.723 --> 03:12.859
Esteban?

03:13.792 --> 03:17.197
Now, you know I don't like
these surprises?

03:17.763 --> 03:19.799
What the hell?

03:33.611 --> 03:34.980
What?

03:35.948 --> 03:38.585
What the hell are you doing,

03:39.550 --> 03:40.986
What the fuck?

03:41.319 --> 03:43.421
Where's my daughter?!

03:43.455 --> 03:44.690
Where's my daughter?!
Who are you?!

03:44.723 --> 03:47.393
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

03:47.425 --> 03:50.829
Mr. Zelman, I finished my job.
I can go, yes?

03:50.862 --> 03:53.865
No, you stay,
and shut your beaner ass up

03:53.899 --> 03:57.302
and let's get down to the
business at hand. Sit down.

03:57.336 --> 04:00.673
Where is my daughter?
Where the fuck is she?!

04:00.705 --> 04:02.974
Juan, you're not a traitor.

04:03.008 --> 04:06.346
<i>No lo creo, no lo creo.</i>

04:06.844 --> 04:08.546
Let's get down
to the business at hand.

04:08.580 --> 04:09.715
Where's my daughter?

04:09.747 --> 04:13.953
Mr. Solis, don't you smell
the garbage in the hallway?

04:14.385 --> 04:15.787
-I'll kill all of you!
-Shut up.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.725
Shut the fuck up.

04:19.757 --> 04:22.728
Motherfucker!

04:22.761 --> 04:25.999
No, no.
Don't you mean "daughterfucker"?

04:29.999 --> 04:31.336
Hey, you better straighten up
and fly right,

04:31.370 --> 04:33.004
you fuckin' one-eyed spic.

04:33.038 --> 04:35.908
I'm not here on my business,
all right?

04:35.940 --> 04:39.744
I'm here doing a favor for the
chinks. I owe 'em one.

04:39.778 --> 04:42.615
And this is a 10-year debt
that I'm settling.

04:43.682 --> 04:47.987
You stir-fried the wrong
fucking chink, didn't you?

04:48.019 --> 04:49.822
I'm just a gun for hire, Mr.
Solis.

04:49.855 --> 04:51.924
Woo King started that battle.

04:51.956 --> 04:56.295
My family only answered
to instigation, and you know it!

04:57.329 --> 04:59.564
My daughter!

05:01.065 --> 05:03.768
I'm gonna cut your head off
if you don't kill me.

05:03.802 --> 05:05.705
Kill me. Do it!

05:05.737 --> 05:07.839
So, I guess a blow job's
out of the question?

05:09.475 --> 05:12.011
Sir, can I just blast his face
off?

05:12.043 --> 05:15.413
No, no, no. I'd like to oblige
you, Mick, but we can't do that.

05:15.447 --> 05:18.384
The deal is we deliver him
alive.

05:18.416 --> 05:22.854
Mr. Woo wants revenge
for his son,

05:22.887 --> 05:25.423
so we got to take you
to the chink warehouse,

05:25.456 --> 05:28.060
and they got some deep-rooted
plans for you, buddy,

05:28.093 --> 05:29.895
and for your little spring roll.

05:29.927 --> 05:31.096
They're gonna slice it off,

05:32.363 --> 05:34.566
and Mr. Woo's gonna cook it up
in a wok, like Chinese sausage,

05:34.600 --> 05:37.069
then he's gonna eat it right in front
of you while you're still alive.

05:37.101 --> 05:39.404
And he's gonna invite some
guests.

05:39.437 --> 05:42.641
Man, these chinks.

05:43.007 --> 05:45.411
When they go after revenge,
it's balls to the wall.

05:45.911 --> 05:47.079
Get him up! Get up!

05:47.413 --> 05:49.915
-Get up, Mick.
-Get up. Stand him up.

05:59.490 --> 06:02.560
I knew you weren't a traitor.
I knew it, Juan.

06:02.593 --> 06:03.795
They took my daughter.

06:03.829 --> 06:06.799
<i>That's the only reason
I was under the gun, carnal.</i>

06:06.831 --> 06:08.533
I understand.
You know I got you covered.

06:08.567 --> 06:11.537
Mr. Zelman, just say green
light, and I'll blast him.

06:11.569 --> 06:13.139
You think you're gonna take me
out? Come on.

06:13.404 --> 06:15.107
You two burritos
think you can blast me away

06:15.374 --> 06:17.042
before my guy gets you?
Come on.

06:17.074 --> 06:18.142
This guy's ex-CIA.

06:18.410 --> 06:20.646
He was a sharpshooter before I
started to pay him more.

06:20.678 --> 06:21.980
He might hit me,

06:22.014 --> 06:24.617
but you're going down with me,
you punk-ass motherfucker.

06:24.649 --> 06:27.485
You took my daughter.
My boys got her back.

06:27.519 --> 06:30.456
Now you got two dead hillbillies
in your home right now.

06:30.488 --> 06:33.024
You're going to hillbilly hell,
motherfucker.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.996
<i>Your cojones
are gonna get you killed.</i>

06:37.028 --> 06:39.564
I never liked it here anyway.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.437
Dumb Mexican.
You got no gun, beaner.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.105
Come on out!

07:15.934 --> 07:17.503
Come on, motherfucker.

08:19.730 --> 08:21.500
<i>Amor.</i>

08:22.867 --> 08:23.868
They killed...

08:23.901 --> 08:27.105
They killed everybody...
Esteban, my wife...

08:28.940 --> 08:30.508
I know who it is!

08:32.677 --> 08:35.047
Fuck! Shit, I got heat!

08:35.080 --> 08:37.650
I got big-time heat.
Listen, I gotta go.

08:37.682 --> 08:40.217
Call out my accountant, tell him
dump all my fucking stuff

08:40.519 --> 08:42.754
Do it right now.
Just do it now.

08:43.956 --> 08:46.591
Don't fuckin' play games,
just dump everything.

08:46.625 --> 08:47.993
Get the cash.

08:48.025 --> 08:49.861
We gotta go liquid on
everything.

08:49.894 --> 08:53.298
Do what the fuck I say, just do
it! I gotta go!

09:14.919 --> 09:17.755
Girls.
You look like you're having fun.

09:17.788 --> 09:20.259
You need something else?

09:20.292 --> 09:23.995
<i>More wine for starters,
Mexicano.</i>

09:24.028 --> 09:26.231
Yeah, go get my sister
some more wine.

09:26.565 --> 09:30.169
What did I tell you about the
dog? Be respectful. He's dirty.

09:32.738 --> 09:33.906
Solis.

09:33.938 --> 09:35.607
Mr. Gonzalo.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.177
I told you,
I don't work on Saturdays.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.912
<i>I'm sorry, abuelo.
Call me on Monday.</i>

09:41.013 --> 09:41.947
Yes, sir.

09:41.980 --> 09:45.250
I-I need to negotiate with you
right now.

09:45.283 --> 09:48.921
Remember that deal about my store,
my office, about a year ago?

09:48.953 --> 09:50.923
You wanted my...
Sir, listen, please.

09:50.956 --> 09:54.326
I-I'm sorry I'm bothering you
on Saturday, but listen, please.

09:54.359 --> 09:58.964
We negotiated a deal on my store
and my doggy biscuit business.

09:58.996 --> 10:01.099
Please, listen to me.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.835
Yes, sir. We negotiated,

10:02.868 --> 10:05.204
but I'll give it to you
for 10 cents on the dollar.

10:09.807 --> 10:12.878
Sounds like you have
a distress business right now.

10:20.985 --> 10:23.722
Right now, sir.
I need an answer right now, sir.

10:46.711 --> 10:49.414
I have no weapons.
I have no weapons.

10:49.748 --> 10:52.785
-I'm on the phone.
-Put your hands up.

10:54.219 --> 10:55.321
I have no weapons.

10:57.288 --> 10:59.324
Get your fucking hands up!
Get 'em up!

10:59.924 --> 11:01.259
Officer, I have no weapons.
I have no intent to harm.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.028
I'm on the phone with my
attorney.

11:03.061 --> 11:04.196
Drop the fuckin' phone

11:04.229 --> 11:06.932
or Henderman will drop you
to your panties, you prick.

11:06.965 --> 11:09.935
-Drop the fuckin' phone.
-Call me when you make bail.

11:09.967 --> 11:13.771
Stop. You're under arrest
for the murder of David Zelman,

11:13.804 --> 11:17.275
Jonathan Skykes,
and Lee Renardo Catello.

11:17.308 --> 11:18.943
And I'm gonna throw
in resisting arrest.

11:18.976 --> 11:22.280
Listen, I'll be out in 18 hours.
They killed my family!

11:22.313 --> 11:24.382
Get in the car. Come on.
Get in the car.

11:24.416 --> 11:26.919
I'll be out in 18 hours.
Put your...

11:26.951 --> 11:28.721
<i>Put your Miranda rights up your
culo.</i>

11:30.221 --> 11:32.423
What do you think of that?

11:32.456 --> 11:35.827
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-They killed my family!

11:35.860 --> 11:38.797
-Get in the car.
-They killed my family!

11:59.116 --> 12:01.352
Your belongings.

12:03.053 --> 12:06.225
Bob, those motherfuckers
made my bail higher

12:06.258 --> 12:08.860
than Charles fucking Manson,
man. What the fuck?

12:08.894 --> 12:11.129
You killed a congressman's son,
Mickey.

12:11.163 --> 12:13.765
A congressman's son?
A congressman's son?

12:13.798 --> 12:15.967
That guy's the head
of the fucking hillbilly mafia.

12:16.999 --> 12:17.470
-He was a drug runner.
-Yeah.

12:17.735 --> 12:19.871
-Crow doesn't peck another crow.
-Yeah.

12:19.904 --> 12:22.875
They're politicians, man. -Yeah,
they're fucking politicians.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.308
Politicians, fuck 'em all.

12:24.341 --> 12:26.444
They should all be fuckin' hung.
Mickey.

12:26.477 --> 12:28.212
Every one of 'em.

12:28.245 --> 12:31.283
We're in a police station.
Maybe...

12:31.316 --> 12:35.220
Hey. Fuck 'em all.
Fuck all of you.

12:35.253 --> 12:37.322
My kid's dead, man.
They don't give a shit.

12:37.355 --> 12:39.991
You think Obama,
or his dirty tranny wife,

12:40.024 --> 12:42.360
or Bush, or any of those people
care about my kids?

12:42.394 --> 12:44.496
Nobody gives a shit
about my kids, man.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.932
Fuck 'em all!
They're all on the same team.

12:46.965 --> 12:49.767
I've got the right guy for you.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.537
This guy.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.140
The best lawyer I've ever seen.

12:55.173 --> 12:58.510
He got Jim Jameson
off triple homicide,

12:58.777 --> 13:02.480
and the cop even saw him
shoot the motherfuckers.

13:02.514 --> 13:06.818
So, there you go.
My job's done.

13:06.851 --> 13:09.954
I have a barbecue tonight
with the wife.

13:10.322 --> 13:16.094
Do you know the difference between
a lawyer and a bail bondsman, Bob?

13:16.126 --> 13:18.496
-No, I don't.
-Nothing.

13:18.529 --> 13:22.168
You're all crooks, all thieves.

13:24.568 --> 13:26.504
Fucking mooch.

13:41.285 --> 13:42.987
Mr. Harrison.

13:43.020 --> 13:45.290
Mickey Solis.

13:45.956 --> 13:47.893
Sit down.

13:49.561 --> 13:53.999
Your mother was a Mexican nanny,
or a housekeeper.

13:55.966 --> 13:59.203
Your father was
an Irish-American trucker

13:59.236 --> 14:07.144
who embodied the stereotype
of a drunken Irish fool.?

14:07.177 --> 14:09.480
So you embraced
your mother's maiden name

14:09.514 --> 14:12.116
because your father...

14:13.217 --> 14:18.022
Well, he left for some
prostitute in Las Vegas.

14:19.323 --> 14:24.395
Let's see. You had two other
sisters,

14:25.629 --> 14:27.600
Maria and Martha,

14:27.932 --> 14:32.403
both of them addicted to heroin,

14:32.437 --> 14:35.974
died by the age of 25.

14:36.006 --> 14:38.109
That's interesting.

14:39.344 --> 14:46.318
Why did you embrace
the low-life path

14:46.350 --> 14:50.623
with those diabolical scumbags

14:50.889 --> 14:54.225
who were responsible
for your own sisters' death?

14:56.293 --> 15:00.598
Those assholes, I took 'em out,
both of them.

15:00.631 --> 15:03.034
And they took my eye.

15:03.067 --> 15:05.002
It's a tough world out there,
sir.

15:05.035 --> 15:09.674
I charge 2,000 an hour.

15:09.941 --> 15:12.576
I'm the meanest motherfucker in
court you've ever seen.

15:12.610 --> 15:19.151
I got 60% of the judges
giving me head, so to speak,

15:19.183 --> 15:20.584
on demand.

15:20.618 --> 15:24.356
The ones who don't, I make sure
I never appear before them.

15:24.389 --> 15:30.662
Never lost a case, and I don't
intend to any time soon.

15:30.695 --> 15:37.035
You, Mr. Solis, are up shit
creek

15:37.067 --> 15:42.540
with only a broken paddle
stickin' out your asshole.

15:42.573 --> 15:46.644
You, my friend, are fucked.

15:47.412 --> 15:51.249
Nobody is gonna take your case,

15:51.282 --> 15:56.555
because even the judges
who suck my proverbial cock

15:56.587 --> 15:58.089
won't touch you

15:58.123 --> 16:02.326
because they don't want to lose
their Masonic memberships.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.063
They got to convict you.

16:05.964 --> 16:13.305
Yep. You are 100%
irretrievably fucked.

16:13.337 --> 16:18.209
Your case, Mr. Solis,
is cut and dry.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.645
A triple murder.

16:20.677 --> 16:25.216
Four neighbors say they see you
going into the building,

16:25.250 --> 16:28.586
they hear the shots,
they see you comin' out,

16:28.620 --> 16:30.688
only one alive.

16:30.721 --> 16:32.090
Boy.

16:32.123 --> 16:37.329
Well, I suggest
that you digest cyanide.

16:37.361 --> 16:40.432
I can, provide you
the spring water.

16:40.465 --> 16:42.735
<i>2K an hour to hear this cagada?</i>

16:45.169 --> 16:48.105
Your Spanish is atrocious.

16:48.139 --> 16:50.174
I learned Spanish
from my grandfather.

16:50.207 --> 16:53.745
He was a Scotsman,
but he had a Mexican nanny,

16:54.011 --> 16:58.250
and he used to hear stories
from his granddaddy before him.

16:58.283 --> 17:03.755
And granddaddy actually fought in
the 1845 Mexican-American war.

17:04.021 --> 17:09.394
Yeah. The Scots and the Irish
Catholics fighting,

17:09.425 --> 17:12.563
slaughtering the indigents
in the name of...

17:12.596 --> 17:15.366
What is it called?
Manifest destiny.

17:17.166 --> 17:22.040
Only, they would hear the bells,
you see, at night,

17:23.173 --> 17:26.077
ringing across the battlefield.

17:26.577 --> 17:33.451
See, all of the Mexican soldiers,
they would be called to mass.

17:34.384 --> 17:38.089
And the Scots and the Irish,
the Catholics,

17:38.123 --> 17:41.559
they hear these sounds, and they
would slip away in the night.

17:43.327 --> 17:44.797
And they would never come back.

17:45.063 --> 17:46.765
Some of them would fall in love.

17:46.798 --> 17:49.101
It's very romantic.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.336
I'm developing a TV series about
it.

17:54.271 --> 17:56.774
I developed a fondness

17:56.807 --> 18:00.177
for the Mexican community
a long time ago.

18:00.211 --> 18:02.346
See, I was bullied in school

18:02.380 --> 18:05.517
by, all the brothers
who would call me a cracker,

18:05.549 --> 18:07.219
and they would
beat the shit out of me.

18:07.251 --> 18:09.320
But there was
this one Mexican-American kid,

18:09.354 --> 18:11.222
big, giant guy,

18:11.256 --> 18:13.792
and he would come,
and he would protect my ass.

18:13.825 --> 18:15.693
Of course, he would charge me
two milk cartons

18:15.727 --> 18:18.697
and three brownies a week for
it.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.332
They taxed you.

18:20.365 --> 18:24.536
I became a successful lawyer.

18:26.371 --> 18:32.477
And I remembered the Mexican
kid,

18:32.509 --> 18:35.747
and I, figured
I owe something back.

18:36.446 --> 18:42.653
I spent a lot of time in Mexico
developing an orphanage for boys

18:42.686 --> 18:47.291
who had it way worse
than you ever did, Mr. Solis.

18:47.325 --> 18:52.564
Take for example, this kid here.
Fernando.

18:52.596 --> 18:54.732
You see him?

18:54.766 --> 19:00.404
He is one of many whom I support
with 50% of everything I earn,

19:00.438 --> 19:05.177
which I take from misguided
dime-a-dozen gangsters like you.

19:05.210 --> 19:08.813
<i>And I donate it to my chicos.</i>

19:08.846 --> 19:15.453
Mr. Harrison,
my family has been slaughtered.

19:16.820 --> 19:20.892
My son, my daughter.

19:21.159 --> 19:25.830
The Woo family, the Chinese
gang, they took them out.

19:25.863 --> 19:29.534
I have absolutely nothing
to live for.

19:29.567 --> 19:31.870
Nothing.

19:31.903 --> 19:35.606
And I would take
that cyanide you offer

19:35.640 --> 19:37.909
if it wasn't for my undying
desire to take...

19:37.942 --> 19:39.211
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:39.243 --> 19:41.445
To... to... to avenge your son
and your daughter

19:41.479 --> 19:45.383
and all of that,
machismo mambo jambo bullshit.

19:45.415 --> 19:48.287
I'm not like you, okay?

19:49.721 --> 19:52.257
But I understand.

19:52.289 --> 19:55.326
I think I would feel the same
way.

19:55.359 --> 19:59.530
But, the hourly rate
remains the same?

19:59.564 --> 20:01.633
Most assuredly so.

20:02.733 --> 20:05.703
So, what you're telling me now
is I should kill myself.

20:05.737 --> 20:07.939
Any other useful information?

20:07.971 --> 20:11.777
Well, I've already made a plea
bargain, manslaughter.

20:12.943 --> 20:15.813
You will do five years.

20:15.846 --> 20:19.483
So, question is,

20:19.517 --> 20:24.422
how long do you need to do
your Pancho Villa routine?

20:24.454 --> 20:26.590
Like, six months?

20:26.624 --> 20:31.429
I can keep you on the street
for about that time,

20:31.461 --> 20:34.665
and then, yeah,
you gotta do your time,

20:34.699 --> 20:37.568
but you'll be out in three
years.

20:37.602 --> 20:42.374
I have nothing else to live for
but to avenge my family.

20:42.406 --> 20:44.742
Well, there is...

20:47.311 --> 20:49.347
a nun.

20:50.515 --> 20:55.987
And if you need some
spiritual help

20:56.019 --> 20:57.321
You should call her.

20:57.355 --> 21:00.525
She charges, 5,000 an hour.

21:00.557 --> 21:03.927
5K an hour for a nun?

21:03.961 --> 21:06.698
She's in your neighborhood.

21:06.730 --> 21:12.738
She has a very mysterious
history.

21:14.305 --> 21:18.410
Anyway, I feel sorry for you,
but I'm also a businessman,

21:18.442 --> 21:21.980
and you bet your ass
she cuts me in.

21:30.555 --> 21:32.324
You know I don't speak that
Spanish.

21:33.423 --> 21:35.926
Why's your sister still here?
Why don't you do me a favor?

21:35.960 --> 21:38.496
Buy her a ticket to Ohio
and send her back.

21:38.528 --> 21:41.566
My sister stays as long as she
wants.

21:41.598 --> 21:42.701
You keep fucking around,

21:42.733 --> 21:44.702
and you'll both
be floating in the pool.

21:44.969 --> 21:47.838
Excuse me, sir,
Mr. Solis is here.

21:48.673 --> 21:49.840
Let him come out.

21:56.513 --> 21:58.049
<i>-Ladies.
-Buenos dias.</i>

21:58.348 --> 22:01.485
I thought you don't speak Spanish.
I do in an emergency.

22:01.519 --> 22:03.922
I told you to keep your dog
in the other yard.

22:03.954 --> 22:05.756
I don't like pit bulls,
especially this one.

22:05.789 --> 22:06.791
Barks all night long.

22:07.657 --> 22:10.527
Mr. Gonzalo,
is it possible we can go inside

22:10.560 --> 22:12.063
and speak
about a very important matter?

22:15.299 --> 22:16.835
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you insane?

22:17.769 --> 22:20.572
I told you, I don't like pit bulls.
I'm gonna shoot this fucking dog.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.774
I told you to leave him.
He's a crazy Mexican.

22:22.807 --> 22:24.643
You're a crazy Mexican!

22:25.442 --> 22:30.514
Mr. Gonzalo, with all due
respect, sir, I can take the dog.

22:34.050 --> 22:35.720
You like to play?

22:35.752 --> 22:38.022
No sir, I...
I don't play.

22:49.666 --> 22:51.735
Your reputation precedes you.

22:51.769 --> 22:54.072
My reputation? And what is that?

22:54.105 --> 22:57.674
We're warriors against the grain.
Maybe you're too old for that.

22:57.708 --> 23:00.945
Don't you think that music's
a little loud, sir?

23:00.978 --> 23:05.549
I hear the Feds are on you,
watching you to fuck up.

23:06.616 --> 23:08.886
Well, maybe you're right.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.989
That music will drown them out,
that's for sure.

23:11.021 --> 23:14.125
What's the ugly gray van
outside?

23:14.392 --> 23:19.963
Well, it's ugly,
but it's not gray, it's silver.

23:19.997 --> 23:22.133
I do some research
on your business.

23:22.165 --> 23:23.867
It's worth only 500K.

23:23.901 --> 23:27.538
10 cents on the dollar means
50K.

23:27.571 --> 23:29.173
I need 700 grand.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.143
What the hell you talking about?
It's 10 cents on the dollar.

23:32.175 --> 23:37.615
Mr. Gonzalo,
my family was slaughtered.

23:37.647 --> 23:39.483
The Woo King family took 'em
out.

23:39.517 --> 23:41.553
I know who they are.
I know what happened.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.854
Why should I be responsible?

23:42.886 --> 23:45.456
Esteban, my son,

23:45.490 --> 23:49.594
when you were younger and on the
street, he helped you.

23:49.626 --> 23:52.096
You climbed up the ranks
because of his hard work, too,

23:52.128 --> 23:54.164
and because of the connection
in Bogata.

23:54.198 --> 23:57.869
Did I have a contract that I had
to pay his father percentages?

23:57.902 --> 23:59.703
No, you don't.

23:59.737 --> 24:03.475
But maybe it could be considered
to be an unwritten law.

24:03.508 --> 24:05.109
Maybe on the street that works,

24:05.142 --> 24:07.879
but I don't live that life
anymore, as you see.

24:07.912 --> 24:11.015
It's good to remember
where you came from, sir.

24:11.048 --> 24:14.519
You might cross those bridges
again.

24:14.818 --> 24:19.890
I'll lend you the 500
with a 10% interest.

24:19.923 --> 24:22.594
You have no idea
what this means to me.

24:22.626 --> 24:24.995
Yes, I do.
10% interest.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.898
I'll help you take
the Woo King family out.

24:27.932 --> 24:30.501
They owe me
three million dollars forever.

24:34.171 --> 24:36.039
What's this?

24:36.073 --> 24:40.011
I'm gonna pay my girlfriend back
for being a bitch.

24:41.112 --> 24:44.216
It's better than the burrito
in the driveway.

24:44.548 --> 24:46.984
Bring it back
when you bring the money.

24:47.018 --> 24:50.054
With a full tank of gas.

24:50.086 --> 24:51.623
It's electric.

25:12.276 --> 25:16.515
You don't look very Mexican.

25:16.913 --> 25:19.116
My mother's Irish.

25:20.250 --> 25:22.287
Irish.

25:22.553 --> 25:26.525
Some say from the seed of
Abraham.

25:27.924 --> 25:31.529
I trained as a nun in Belfast.

25:33.029 --> 25:36.233
I'll never forget
those beautiful children

25:36.267 --> 25:42.540
with their pale, white skin
and their rosy cheeks.

25:43.641 --> 25:44.509
How did you know it was me?

25:44.541 --> 25:48.779
Mr. Harrison told me.

25:50.080 --> 25:53.116
It's not every day
a pirate walks in here.

25:56.019 --> 25:58.323
I haven't smiled for a while.

25:58.588 --> 26:04.328
I heard what happened to you,
to your family.

26:04.595 --> 26:11.769
May I say that death
is a door that opens.

26:13.037 --> 26:15.673
I hope not for some.

26:17.173 --> 26:19.676
You're angry.

26:19.710 --> 26:22.681
I know that kind of spirit.

26:24.615 --> 26:28.787
It can be a driving force
to obliterate evil.

26:29.854 --> 26:32.222
I remember...

26:32.256 --> 26:36.294
I remember well,
when I was young.

26:39.262 --> 26:43.201
This older man...

26:45.201 --> 26:48.707
with gray hair.

26:49.707 --> 26:52.110
He was a priest.

26:53.778 --> 26:58.182
He thought I was lovely.

26:59.349 --> 27:03.186
He said it too often.

27:07.023 --> 27:09.793
And then, one day,
he took what would remain

27:09.826 --> 27:13.064
my darkest childhood memory.

27:13.096 --> 27:16.734
Why are you telling me all this?
I wasn't finished.

27:19.836 --> 27:22.240
As I lay there,

27:24.307 --> 27:29.379
bleeding from my lower parts
at nine years old,

27:29.413 --> 27:31.382
I knew.

27:31.414 --> 27:35.153
I knew that the devil
lives inside this church

27:35.185 --> 27:38.288
just as much as the angels do.

27:41.991 --> 27:44.128
And I swore...

27:46.262 --> 27:50.033
to devote my whole being

27:50.067 --> 27:53.770
to avenging anyone
who harmed children.

27:53.804 --> 27:55.940
What happened to the priest?

27:57.775 --> 28:01.312
<i>Le corte los huevos al cabrón.</i>

28:02.846 --> 28:05.849
Look, I don't have time for this
crap.

28:05.883 --> 28:09.120
You don't have time to avenge
for your granddaughter?

28:10.788 --> 28:13.024
She was pregnant when she died.

28:13.257 --> 28:15.393
My daughter was pregnant?

28:15.726 --> 28:17.462
Yes.

28:19.430 --> 28:22.266
I don't want to live
in this darkness anymore.

28:22.298 --> 28:26.471
I only took on this job
because of your granddaughter.

28:26.737 --> 28:30.075
I know Mr. King.
I used to go to them for funds.

28:31.808 --> 28:34.345
-Funds? What kind of funds?
-Funds.

28:34.711 --> 28:40.917
It takes funds to find and then
to take out child abusers.

28:40.951 --> 28:44.855
<i>I thought Mr. King and his family
were good people, buena gente,</i>

28:44.888 --> 28:47.023
and then I learned that they
were in the black market

28:47.057 --> 28:51.362
making snuff films with little
ones...

28:54.865 --> 29:00.404
Mr. Solis, I know who is responsible
for the hit on your family.

29:01.137 --> 29:03.974
I can get to his lieutenant,

29:05.843 --> 29:10.981
and from him, I can find the
whereabouts of Mr. King himself.

29:11.015 --> 29:15.086
The rest, it's up to you.

29:18.154 --> 29:20.023
You?

29:20.924 --> 29:22.326
You?
What, you're gonna do it alone?

29:22.358 --> 29:24.528
What are you gonna do,
choke him with your habit?

29:25.429 --> 29:26.831
What's your name?

29:29.165 --> 29:31.402
I'm a nun.

29:41.878 --> 29:43.413
<i>Cincuenta mil.</i>

29:43.948 --> 29:45.115
50K...

29:48.085 --> 29:51.221
And I'll get you
all the information you need.

29:56.559 --> 29:58.529
Good night, Mr. Solis.

30:03.133 --> 30:03.802
Yeah.

30:38.535 --> 30:42.874
Hello. It's a little late to be
calling.

30:42.906 --> 30:44.942
Who is this?

30:45.476 --> 30:48.980
I'm sorry to be calling so late.

30:49.012 --> 30:51.915
It's very important.

30:51.949 --> 30:54.952
I wanted to let you know
it's the pirate.

31:01.090 --> 31:04.294
What can I do for you, Mr.
Solis?

31:05.962 --> 31:08.066
It's a green light.

31:08.598 --> 31:11.336
You remember what I said?

31:12.102 --> 31:15.573
Well, yeah.
I got the money.

31:15.605 --> 31:19.943
Half now, and half
when you're done with the job.

31:22.112 --> 31:25.516
It's inside the flowers I got
you.

31:28.885 --> 31:30.153
And you better get 'em quick,

31:30.186 --> 31:33.323
because you never know
about these priests.

31:34.325 --> 31:38.096
I only got you the flowers because
you were helping my family out.

31:39.128 --> 31:40.964
You know, helping me out.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.501
I'm a nun, for goodness sake.

31:45.536 --> 31:48.972
And I'm a good Catholic boy.

31:53.544 --> 31:56.681
Thank you for helping me.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.083
I hope this works out.

32:03.153 --> 32:05.056
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

33:06.182 --> 33:08.185
<i>Chinga tu madre!</i>

33:10.186 --> 33:12.423
Fuck.

33:15.992 --> 33:18.729
I drank way too much.

33:26.670 --> 33:28.373
Hey, you here?

33:28.739 --> 33:29.707
<i>Perro?</i>

33:31.575 --> 33:32.410
<i>Perro?</i>

33:36.012 --> 33:38.415
Hey.

33:38.449 --> 33:41.285
You were right there the whole
time.

33:42.452 --> 33:44.555
How you doing?

33:48.092 --> 33:51.395
Hey, you know,
I never got your name.

33:51.428 --> 33:52.763
What's your name?

34:01.738 --> 34:04.342
When my...

34:06.175 --> 34:11.148
When my daughter,
when she was young, she...

34:14.585 --> 34:17.221
She got a little dog.

34:17.820 --> 34:22.159
And she came running up to me, and
she says, "Papi, I got a dog!

34:22.192 --> 34:24.829
And guess what
I'm gonna name him?

34:25.762 --> 34:28.498
I'm gonna name the dog 'Dog'."

34:30.367 --> 34:33.838
<i>I said, "Mija, you can't name
your dog, 'Dog'."</i>

34:35.371 --> 34:38.174
And she said,

34:38.208 --> 34:43.748
"Papi, it's my dog,
and his name is 'Dog'."

34:47.251 --> 34:49.487
I'm sorry I'm not such
a good host,

34:50.152 --> 34:56.360
but I'm alone now,
and, well...

34:59.128 --> 35:03.433
It's hard for me to look at
this, so I-I keep it in here.

35:04.601 --> 35:06.202
I'll get you some dog food
today.

35:14.510 --> 35:15.846
Thank you.

35:39.902 --> 35:41.838
"Pirate, this is your favorite
'N'.

35:43.139 --> 35:44.442
I did good, didn't I?

35:44.675 --> 35:46.577
Your China dream
is just a few miles away."

35:54.217 --> 35:54.918
Yeah?

35:55.184 --> 35:56.619
<i>Mickey, hermano.</i>

35:56.652 --> 36:00.423
<i>Hey, is this Rudy?
What's up, Rudy?</i>

36:00.456 --> 36:01.458
<i>Come on, ese.</i>

36:01.492 --> 36:04.495
Mickey, we know everything
you've been through.

36:04.527 --> 36:06.629
<i>Sorry, effacito.</i>

36:06.663 --> 36:07.931
<i>Gracias, hermano.</i>

36:08.164 --> 36:09.900
<i>Hey, listen,
I really appreciate it, man.</i>

36:09.932 --> 36:11.902
<i>Hey, Mickey, come by Sunday.</i>

36:11.934 --> 36:13.503
<i>-We'll have a barbecue.
-Yeah.</i>

36:13.536 --> 36:15.338
<i>We can talk there.</i>

36:18.208 --> 36:19.809
<i>Okay, hermano.
I really appreciate it.</i>

36:19.842 --> 36:21.578
<i>I'll see you guys there.
Bring whoever you can.</i>

36:21.612 --> 36:23.713
<i>Órale, nos vemos.</i>

36:23.746 --> 36:25.849
<i>Okay, carnal. Gracias.</i>

36:32.188 --> 36:33.190
Yes.

36:34.257 --> 36:36.759
<i>-Say, Mickey.
-Mr. Harrison.</i>

36:36.793 --> 36:38.929
<i>Hey, I got a few questions for
you.</i>

36:38.961 --> 36:41.364
Quick, quick couple of
questions.

36:41.398 --> 36:44.367
I don't want to waste
your precious time.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.271
So, do you know
what date it is today?

36:48.304 --> 36:50.306
You missed the wire date,
motherfucker.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.910
Shit. Hey, look, I have
every intention of paying you.

36:53.476 --> 36:55.980
My guy, he pays in increments,
you know?

36:56.313 --> 36:58.849
Do you have any idea
what I had to do

36:59.583 --> 37:02.452
and who I had to grease

37:02.485 --> 37:06.856
to make the deal to get you
out of prison for six months

37:06.889 --> 37:08.658
and to get you out for
manslaughter?

37:08.692 --> 37:10.994
-Do you have any idea?
-Yes, sir, I understand that.

37:11.327 --> 37:13.998
So, don't fuck around with me.
Okay?

37:15.831 --> 37:19.336
<i>You think I get intimidated
by some chalupa mob?</i>

37:19.603 --> 37:22.673
You cunt.
I want my fuckin' money.

37:22.706 --> 37:24.942
Hey, look. Hey, look.
I understand.

37:24.974 --> 37:27.411
Hey, I'm not the guy
to push right now.

37:27.443 --> 37:28.579
Who am I, Mickey?

37:28.612 --> 37:32.782
<i>Well, you're a great lawyer.
I'm gonna handle it.</i>

37:32.815 --> 37:36.987
I am Barkley fucking Harrison.

37:37.253 --> 37:41.592
You think some chink mob
or some burrito hit squad

37:41.625 --> 37:44.594
can fuck with Barkley Harrison?

37:46.530 --> 37:47.731
I never said anything.

37:47.764 --> 37:52.736
Shut the fuck up, you cunt.

37:52.768 --> 37:59.009
I will send the one-eyed
Illuminati Satanists

37:59.275 --> 38:01.911
to pay you a fuckin' visit.

38:01.945 --> 38:05.983
Do you know who they are?

38:06.016 --> 38:09.385
They are my friends!

38:09.418 --> 38:11.855
My friends!

38:11.887 --> 38:15.692
Every black and white,

38:15.726 --> 38:18.561
every guy in a tie,

38:19.862 --> 38:24.335
every white trash detective
in Orange County,

38:24.367 --> 38:26.936
every fucking congressman,
every mayor.

38:26.969 --> 38:31.541
The fuckin' president of the
United States takes my calls.

38:33.443 --> 38:36.380
This guy is fucking crazy.

38:36.413 --> 38:40.650
If it wasn't for my daughter and
my son, I'd fuckin' blast him.

38:41.885 --> 38:44.989
<i>Only 'cause I wanna get
venganza.</i>

38:46.889 --> 38:49.926
I know your struggle.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.795
We are one,

38:52.829 --> 38:56.967
<i>but don't you fuckin' forget
my chicos, Mickey.</i>

38:57.000 --> 39:01.838
<i>My chicos.</i>

39:09.679 --> 39:11.916
Motherfucker.

39:13.849 --> 39:16.119
Fucking lawyers.

39:18.922 --> 39:21.858
Every dog has his day.

39:27.563 --> 39:29.766
Rudy's waiting for you.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.001
Rudy!

39:34.503 --> 39:38.074
<i>I hear you're makin' a lot of
ducats on the street, que no?</i>

39:38.108 --> 39:43.547
<i>Mickey, all these pendejos
on the streets of LA.</i>

39:43.579 --> 39:45.782
I wanna live like Obama
but I ain't gonna change it

39:45.815 --> 39:48.651
from the White House
to the Brown House.

39:48.684 --> 39:51.989
<i>Hey, Mickey, I hear that you
need to fire up some chinos.</i>

39:52.021 --> 39:54.424
<i>Just let me know, mijo.</i>

39:54.458 --> 39:57.693
If these bam-bams don't work,
this will.

40:00.896 --> 40:03.766
<i>Mickey, then show me to do
negocios.</i>

40:03.800 --> 40:08.071
I ain't letting these motherfuckers get
away with all that shit they pull.

40:08.103 --> 40:12.409
How many people knew his
daughter, let alone Esteban?

40:17.813 --> 40:21.717
We all know what happened to them,
but now, it's time to fix this shit.

40:21.751 --> 40:26.557
<i>Hermanos, I,... I didn't come
here for a handout.</i>

40:27.657 --> 40:33.164
<i>I came here to give people feria
who want to chop on my onda.</i>

40:35.431 --> 40:38.468
I got to fix
these Woo King motherfuckers.

40:42.672 --> 40:47.744
These guys, we can't let 'em
get away with this

40:47.777 --> 40:51.514
without retribution,
what they did to my family.

40:51.547 --> 40:54.183
<i>¿Tu sabes?</i>

40:54.217 --> 40:56.552
If we lose this respect
on the streets,

40:56.585 --> 40:59.755
all our value on the street
will go way down.

40:59.789 --> 41:02.659
We gotta do something,
and we gotta do it now.

41:02.692 --> 41:07.664
<i>You might think this is just
about venganza, revenge,</i>

41:08.231 --> 41:11.168
but that's not true.
It's about respect and honor.

41:11.201 --> 41:15.239
Respect we had
since the fuckin' '60s?

41:15.838 --> 41:17.708
And that's why
we gotta take 'em down now,

41:17.740 --> 41:20.811
this fucking Woo King family.

41:20.844 --> 41:25.182
But we gotta do it without an
army.

41:25.215 --> 41:27.550
'Cause if we go in there with an
army, they're gonna run,

41:27.583 --> 41:29.085
and everybody's gonna scram,

41:29.119 --> 41:32.623
and it's all gonna be fucked up,
the operation.

41:32.655 --> 41:34.657
I need two of the best here.

41:34.690 --> 41:37.226
Hey, Mickey.
I'm not doing this for money.

41:37.260 --> 41:40.030
I'm doing this for fun.

41:41.231 --> 41:44.201
What about you? Let's go down
and fuck around?

41:44.233 --> 41:49.273
<i>Hey, jefito, you know I would be
in, but I got too much business.</i>

41:49.606 --> 41:51.942
A lot of shit going down in TJ,
homie.

41:52.876 --> 41:56.247
I need Benjamin Franklins.
I can't fuck it up, homie.

41:57.813 --> 41:59.949
Yeah.

42:00.849 --> 42:03.052
I guess it's gonna be
just me and Mona.

42:03.085 --> 42:06.589
-We'll take 'em down.
-I got Hector.

42:06.623 --> 42:08.724
He can do some leg work for you.

42:08.757 --> 42:09.859
You know what, motherfucker?

42:09.893 --> 42:12.862
If you don't help Mickey,
you will get no pussy.

42:12.896 --> 42:16.267
<i>I'm cutting you off
for, like, dias.</i>

42:16.532 --> 42:19.635
No, years.
You got that, punk?

42:19.668 --> 42:22.306
No pussy for 10 years.

42:24.106 --> 42:27.177
<i>Chingao, Mickey, I think
I can reschedule some things</i>

42:27.210 --> 42:29.646
for later that month.

42:33.983 --> 42:36.853
Sir, you may go
with your brother and sister.

42:36.885 --> 42:39.155
The Mahjong game starts from
eight.

42:39.188 --> 42:42.291
I shall have your dinner
prepared at 10:00.

42:42.324 --> 42:47.263
Meixiu, you're only half my age, but
you're sounding like my mother.

42:47.297 --> 42:50.099
I will return at the time I
desire. Bye.

43:19.061 --> 43:21.264
Sir, we got a problem at the
bank.

43:22.132 --> 43:24.335
We need the money,
500,000 in gold and cash,

43:24.668 --> 43:28.271
counted by 6:00 a.m. tomorrow,
in the shipment to Shanghai.

43:28.304 --> 43:30.641
Is that all?

43:30.673 --> 43:33.744
They told me by Monday
I would have to.

43:33.777 --> 43:35.012
That was the case,

43:35.045 --> 43:37.146
but our FBI tag said that if we
don't get it out by tomorrow,

43:37.179 --> 43:40.750
Immigration's gonna come
and swipe it up.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.786
Okay.

43:51.728 --> 43:54.231
So, I will have to drop you here
now.

43:54.264 --> 43:56.032
Enjoy the game of Mahjong,

43:56.266 --> 44:00.371
and my dear daughter will come
here on Monday to meet you all.

44:00.704 --> 44:02.206
Okay.

44:11.313 --> 44:13.250
Hey, how do you know
Woo King's here?

44:13.282 --> 44:18.322
Woo King plays domino every
single Thursday at the same time.

44:20.356 --> 44:23.227
Hey, guys, that's it.
There is Woo King's car.

44:27.797 --> 44:30.768
Hey, Rudy, there is a woman
in the car.

44:31.701 --> 44:33.936
I don't care.

44:33.969 --> 44:36.239
Kill them all.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.976
Let's go.

45:02.231 --> 45:05.201
Where's Woo King?!
Where's Woo King?!

45:05.235 --> 45:07.905
Where the fuck is Woo King?!

45:09.739 --> 45:10.441
Let's go. Woo King's not here.

45:10.773 --> 45:12.208
Let's go! Go!

45:21.050 --> 45:23.420
Sir, it's getting very dangerous
right now.

45:23.920 --> 45:26.956
Please grab your valuables.
You must go to Meixiu's.

45:26.989 --> 45:28.758
We may be staying a while.

46:33.856 --> 46:36.259
Angels, if you're out there,

46:38.862 --> 46:44.968
tell my beautiful, lovely
daughter and Esteban

46:45.001 --> 46:48.438
that I'm sorry I brought their
souls to an early death

46:48.471 --> 46:54.143
for my lifestyle
and my mistakes in my life.

46:58.146 --> 47:00.483
I will avenge their souls.

47:10.092 --> 47:10.860
Yeah?

47:10.893 --> 47:14.496
<i>Hey, jefe. It's Rudy.
Carnal.</i>

47:14.530 --> 47:17.000
<i>This bitch Woo King
wants to meet with you.</i>

47:21.536 --> 47:26.143
Sir, I do not believe
this meeting should take place.

47:27.376 --> 47:32.581
My suggestions to you
as your spiritual advisor...

47:32.614 --> 47:36.185
What wisdom do you wish to
convey?

47:36.219 --> 47:41.557
Mickey Solis, he falls under the
star sign of the Tiger.

47:41.858 --> 47:47.931
It symbolizes the traits
of bravery, unpredictability.

47:47.963 --> 47:51.467
I can assure you,
he will fight to his death

47:51.501 --> 47:55.239
to protect his loved ones'
honor.

47:57.172 --> 48:00.609
I too fall under the same sign.

48:00.643 --> 48:09.519
Meixiu, a woman's stillness
is her greatest attribute.

48:38.347 --> 48:40.951
The chinks have been checked
just like you.

48:42.418 --> 48:45.989
No metal in this room.
Just us.

48:46.956 --> 48:49.293
You know
the Southside Conference rules.

48:50.059 --> 48:51.295
They're in place.

48:54.496 --> 48:57.233
You both got 30 minutes maximum.

48:59.501 --> 49:03.340
If you don't come to an
agreement,

49:03.373 --> 49:04.708
then we escort all of you
out of here,

49:05.474 --> 49:10.079
and then you can blast your
monkey asses off in the street.

49:11.213 --> 49:16.719
If it gets physical, then we
blast whatever side starts it.

49:17.353 --> 49:23.492
Mr. Solis, I never met you before,
but I heard a lot about you.

49:25.061 --> 49:26.696
A couple of made guys

49:26.728 --> 49:30.500
wanted to bring you in
as a consultant on a few things.

49:32.367 --> 49:33.670
I'm sorry about the loss
of your family.

49:34.737 --> 49:37.173
Well, then,
let's just get down to business.

49:38.541 --> 49:40.177
I'm here to listen.

49:41.043 --> 49:43.045
My father taught me
to observe all doors

49:43.713 --> 49:45.481
before going through any of
them.

49:46.014 --> 49:46.549
What do you want?

49:47.516 --> 49:50.452
I say what he wants,
to bring peace now?

49:50.485 --> 49:55.290
Because we whacked all his family,
and now he wants to bring peace?

49:55.324 --> 49:56.760
He's just a coward.

49:57.025 --> 49:59.495
He knows that Mexicans
don't give up.

49:59.528 --> 50:02.199
Do you hear that?
Mexicans don't give up.

50:02.565 --> 50:05.702
But we will hear
what Mr. King has to say.

50:06.536 --> 50:08.304
What do you have to say?

50:08.336 --> 50:14.643
Mr. Solis,
your son, your daughter,

50:14.677 --> 50:18.314
they will never return to this
earth.

50:18.347 --> 50:24.054
My son, my son, do you hear me?

50:24.086 --> 50:28.358
My son, he will not return
to this earth.

50:28.757 --> 50:32.428
You deserve death. Death!

50:33.628 --> 50:36.565
Fellows, we do not get paid
enough

50:36.599 --> 50:40.503
for this chicken chow mein
soap opera.

50:40.536 --> 50:43.407
Hey, fuck you.
Fuck you!

50:44.407 --> 50:47.344
The Italian mob went out with
disco.

50:48.043 --> 50:51.248
You motherfuckers ain't got nothing
left on the street, and you know it.

50:52.547 --> 50:55.284
You want to blast me, go ahead.

50:55.717 --> 51:01.290
<i>If my people green light you, if
my gente, they put you on blast,</i>

51:01.324 --> 51:04.693
you'll be out before you can say
"badabing badaboom."

51:05.661 --> 51:10.700
Mr. King, you didn't say we had
to do deal with this shit.

51:10.733 --> 51:12.568
What the hell?

51:16.438 --> 51:18.540
It is courageous,

51:18.574 --> 51:24.246
your display in front of these
nice Italian colleagues.

51:24.280 --> 51:29.285
However, shall we think
about the rest of our family?

51:29.318 --> 51:33.556
And I only have
my youngest daughter.

51:33.588 --> 51:38.795
You took the rest of our family.

51:38.827 --> 51:40.496
Is that not enough?

51:40.730 --> 51:44.367
You are the one
who brought this fire on.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.668
I only put it out.

51:46.268 --> 51:48.737
It is not only my daughter,

51:48.771 --> 51:51.841
a person I am eager for,

51:51.873 --> 51:53.609
it is for all of us.

51:55.311 --> 52:01.217
Are we so ignorant
to take all our lives down?

52:01.250 --> 52:06.523
Yes, I won't lie,
I want my daughter's life.

52:06.556 --> 52:08.758
I know you Mexicans
won't kill the young,

52:08.791 --> 52:11.260
but when my daughter grows
older,

52:11.293 --> 52:13.696
she might be the object
of your revenge.

52:14.262 --> 52:16.900
I will do anything to stop this
war.

52:17.233 --> 52:21.237
I know it's hard to believe,
but I'm sorry for your loss.

52:21.269 --> 52:25.809
Mr. King, we're both
businessmen.

52:26.141 --> 52:28.711
We both knew and understood

52:29.144 --> 52:33.550
the risks involved
in this type of business.

52:33.583 --> 52:37.887
We both knew that our children's
lives could also be like a vapor,

52:38.153 --> 52:40.523
and they could go like this.

52:41.590 --> 52:43.527
And they did.

52:45.360 --> 52:48.397
And now,
we both suffer the anguish.

52:50.565 --> 52:52.768
I live in hell.

52:54.503 --> 52:57.273
I am the walking dead.

52:57.306 --> 52:59.509
We can end all of this now.

52:59.541 --> 53:02.746
Mr. Solis, you don't desire to
live.

53:04.480 --> 53:06.849
I can't give you the reason for
that.

53:06.882 --> 53:10.619
Your mother, she is...
She is not the reason?

53:10.652 --> 53:12.921
What are you fuckin' playing at?

53:12.954 --> 53:15.958
My mother left me long, long
ago.

53:16.224 --> 53:18.862
Yet, she gave you life,
did she not?

53:19.561 --> 53:22.397
Yet, she is safe.
She's very safe.

53:22.431 --> 53:24.867
You don't love her,
but she's still your mother.

53:25.333 --> 53:28.204
I want this war to end
for my daughter.

53:28.737 --> 53:31.306
I have not seen my mother
in 30 years.

53:31.340 --> 53:33.476
You think you get to me?

53:33.509 --> 53:35.512
Is blood not thicker than water?

53:35.710 --> 53:38.580
We can end this meeting
for my daughter's life.

53:38.614 --> 53:42.284
My daughter's life
for your mother you hated.

53:50.293 --> 53:52.662
-Man.
-Wait, wait.

53:54.329 --> 53:56.365
Please, sit.

53:59.367 --> 54:00.903
<i>No way, jefe.</i>

54:02.003 --> 54:04.406
Enough blood has flowed.

54:06.309 --> 54:09.980
Enough. Enough has flowed.

54:11.981 --> 54:17.320
Can you assure me my mother
will stay alive and unharmed?

54:17.353 --> 54:21.992
I assure you
that no harm will come to her.

54:22.791 --> 54:25.661
Then I give you your daughter's
life.

54:27.429 --> 54:32.567
My daughter's life,
you give me your solemn word?

54:32.601 --> 54:40.343
I swear on my daughter's soul
that no harm will come to her.

54:55.423 --> 54:56.625
Hey, Rudy.

54:56.659 --> 54:58.961
<i>Where are you, man? I thought
you were at the casita.</i>

54:58.994 --> 55:03.066
<i>No, holmes, I'm not at the casita.
I'm at the accountant office.</i>

55:03.365 --> 55:05.001
Yeah, this guy,
he don't do shit I say.

55:05.034 --> 55:07.003
I call him up 50 times,
he don't do shit.

55:07.036 --> 55:10.005
Like, these, you know, lawyers
and his fucking' bail bondsmen

55:10.572 --> 55:12.908
are a bunch of criminals,
holmes.

55:13.842 --> 55:18.413
Hey, look, I need a takedown
guy.

55:18.447 --> 55:22.385
Somebody quick, smart,
but a badass.

55:22.418 --> 55:24.820
Yeah, man, Hector is the best.

55:24.853 --> 55:28.423
Hector? Hector Ortiz?

55:28.456 --> 55:30.559
<i>Simón, Hector Ortiz.</i>

55:30.592 --> 55:33.495
Shit, he used to do my fuckin'
pickups in the 90's, holmes.

55:33.695 --> 55:34.864
He's still around?

55:34.896 --> 55:37.500
Yeah, man. He's still there,
he's still around.

55:37.532 --> 55:40.001
<i>He's puro soldado, homie.</i>

55:46.509 --> 55:47.909
It's certainly nice to ascertain

55:47.943 --> 55:50.113
while you cancel
a perfectly good offer.

55:50.378 --> 55:51.913
I'm very busy.

55:51.947 --> 55:54.650
And, by the way,
I left you a message.

55:54.682 --> 55:57.519
That was smart. You left
a message on my house phone.

55:57.552 --> 56:00.889
You didn't think of leaving it
on my cell phone?

56:02.123 --> 56:03.125
Ambassador Berman,

56:03.425 --> 56:05.694
you know, I must have sat
in this office 33 times

56:05.728 --> 56:09.699
since you became the German
ambassador to the USA.

56:09.731 --> 56:12.101
I've never found one mistake.

56:14.637 --> 56:16.706
You're an amazing woman.

56:18.541 --> 56:21.544
Who'd have thought?
May I?

56:21.577 --> 56:25.982
Two old age foes could have
such a collegial relationship.

56:26.782 --> 56:31.921
William, I suggest you stop
trying to get me in bed

56:31.954 --> 56:33.689
every time you wanna know more

56:33.722 --> 56:37.593
about Angela Merkel's
anti-Obama spy tactics.

56:37.626 --> 56:40.463
Maybe you are not British.

56:40.496 --> 56:42.898
Maybe you are CIA.

56:42.931 --> 56:46.101
-I loathe them, darling.
-Do you?

56:46.135 --> 56:49.806
My father was not found with 23
bullets in his upper torso

56:49.838 --> 56:51.074
for no reason.

56:51.407 --> 56:52.942
He was raised in Bavaria,

56:52.974 --> 56:55.110
and he did not know
any of this business

56:55.143 --> 56:57.179
with the East side of Los
Angeles.

56:57.445 --> 56:59.449
And for some mysterious reason,

56:59.481 --> 57:02.518
he was gunned down
in the middle of the night,

57:02.550 --> 57:04.186
on the night I bid him farewell.

57:04.420 --> 57:05.954
Did you know something about
that?

57:05.987 --> 57:08.824
Frankly, Greta, I,... I find
your paranoia disconcerting.

57:08.858 --> 57:12.728
You know very well I have
no intel on your father's death.

57:12.760 --> 57:17.766
And you also knew the risks of
your job, of your ambassadorship.

57:19.201 --> 57:23.005
Especially a country like Germany
with so many historical enemies.

57:23.038 --> 57:25.675
And let me ask you something.

57:25.708 --> 57:28.177
How do you know it wasn't another
country that paid the Mexicans?

57:28.210 --> 57:31.847
Our country is only rich
because we work damn hard.

57:35.217 --> 57:36.919
Yes, Katrina?

57:36.952 --> 57:41.658
<i>Mrs. Berman,
there's a very demanding man.</i>

57:42.724 --> 57:43.925
Solis?

57:43.958 --> 57:45.461
<i>How did you know?</i>

57:46.728 --> 57:48.130
Instinct rules me.

57:48.664 --> 57:50.199
We have a meeting.

57:50.231 --> 57:53.902
I'm just finishing this meeting.

57:53.936 --> 57:56.139
He can drive here
at his convenience.

57:56.472 --> 57:57.807
<i>He's already here
in the office, ma'am.</i>

57:58.139 --> 58:00.242
But how did he come through
Security?

58:00.576 --> 58:02.010
<i>He had your passcode, ma'am.</i>

58:02.878 --> 58:05.248
Yes. Yes, I remember.

58:06.114 --> 58:07.850
Okay, send him in.

58:11.152 --> 58:13.822
-Mrs. Ambassador.
-What's this?

58:14.690 --> 58:15.858
It's Mr. Solis.

58:16.692 --> 58:18.795
He's wearing an eyepatch,
for God's sake.

58:19.695 --> 58:21.597
I don't know who you are,

58:21.630 --> 58:23.199
and maybe I don't care to know,

58:24.500 --> 58:26.601
but I got a meeting
with the ambassador,

58:26.635 --> 58:28.137
and I suggest you let us have
it.

58:28.170 --> 58:29.505
You "got" a meeting?

58:29.871 --> 58:31.239
I "have" a meeting
with the ambassador,

58:31.273 --> 58:33.242
-I think you'll find, dear boy.
-Out of my face, holmes.

58:33.275 --> 58:35.677
-Let me just call Security.
-Yeah, you call Security.

58:35.878 --> 58:37.780
They're all from my
neighborhood, motherfucker.

58:38.012 --> 58:40.215
Please, it's personal.

58:41.050 --> 58:43.252
What was your first name?

58:43.284 --> 58:44.887
Mickey.

58:45.219 --> 58:48.090
Well, touché, Mickey Solis.

58:50.693 --> 58:53.730
<i>What got stuck up that guy's
culo?</i>

58:54.597 --> 58:58.634
What the hell you think
you are doing here?

58:58.666 --> 59:00.936
You can destroy my reputation
in one hour.

59:01.704 --> 59:05.141
Hey, you told me to come here
when I needed to,

59:05.173 --> 59:05.974
when I needed something.

59:06.775 --> 59:09.878
And I need something right now,
a favor.

59:09.911 --> 59:12.114
You could have called me
on my cell first.

59:12.146 --> 59:14.817
I did. I left a message.
You didn't answer.

59:14.849 --> 59:17.987
Well, I don't have always my
cell.

59:18.019 --> 59:20.590
Why are you risking my
reputation coming here?

59:21.123 --> 59:23.626
Mrs. Berman,
when your father was killed,

59:23.659 --> 59:25.227
you came to me,
I didn't come to you.

59:25.260 --> 59:27.597
You wanted to know
who killed him, I found out,

59:27.630 --> 59:29.898
and I took care of business.

59:29.931 --> 59:31.933
Now, it's your turn
to repay the favor.

59:31.967 --> 59:34.336
It's not the proper time, Mr.
Solis. -Mrs. Berman!

59:34.603 --> 59:37.740
My kids were
in the prime of their life.

59:39.173 --> 59:40.643
Now, you owe me a favor,

59:40.675 --> 59:43.179
and I'm coming here
to fucking collect, you got it?

59:43.211 --> 59:44.713
I paid you well.

59:44.746 --> 59:48.250
Money doesn't mean everything
when your life's at risk.

59:48.282 --> 59:51.219
Now, you owe me a fuckin' favor,
and I need it now.

59:51.253 --> 59:53.256
You need not curse.

59:54.356 --> 59:57.293
I need two passports for two
ladies.

59:57.326 --> 01:00:00.896
And two visas.
They gotta go to Asia.

01:00:01.163 --> 01:00:02.764
They gotta take a boat.

01:00:02.797 --> 01:00:04.699
And I need 'em now.

01:00:04.733 --> 01:00:07.769
I'm not the queen,
I'm a damn ambassador.

01:00:07.802 --> 01:00:10.339
How shall I get your passports,
and for whom?

01:00:11.172 --> 01:00:12.774
You don't have to curse.

01:00:42.237 --> 01:00:44.072
How was your day at school?

01:00:44.106 --> 01:00:46.075
Very well thank you.

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:56.052
Hey. Don't think about it.
Give it to me.

01:00:58.653 --> 01:01:00.422
I could kill you in front of the
girl and make it easy.

01:01:01.923 --> 01:01:03.059
Take her in the car.

01:01:06.795 --> 01:01:10.133
You got five seconds to say your
prayers, and then, you're dead.

01:01:18.373 --> 01:01:19.708
-What's your name?
-Mulan.

01:01:20.842 --> 01:01:26.114
Mulan. I know that it's been
a very difficult day for you,

01:01:26.148 --> 01:01:31.387
but I assure you, nothing is
going to happen bad to you.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.456
-Okay?
-Okay.

01:01:33.688 --> 01:01:35.391
All right.

01:01:35.423 --> 01:01:37.326
There's gonna be a lady.

01:01:37.358 --> 01:01:40.096
She's gonna come
and take you somewhere,

01:01:40.128 --> 01:01:42.197
take you to Beijing
to your grandparents.

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:47.136
You told me
that you enjoyed it there, yes?

01:01:47.168 --> 01:01:47.769
Okay.

01:01:48.336 --> 01:01:50.373
The lady that comes along...

01:01:54.342 --> 01:01:56.111
It's okay. It's Norma.

01:01:57.079 --> 01:01:59.148
<i>Hey, Norma.
¿Como estas?</i>

01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:01.083
Come here, baby.

01:02:01.115 --> 01:02:03.485
-How are you?
-Hey, Mickey.

01:02:04.719 --> 01:02:08.156
-Sorry about your family, man.
-It's okay.

01:02:08.489 --> 01:02:12.293
Here's 30K in cash,

01:02:12.327 --> 01:02:14.931
and two plane tickets to
Beijing.

01:02:17.065 --> 01:02:19.168
You got the passports ready?
The new ones?

01:02:19.768 --> 01:02:22.137
Got 'em. Good as new.

01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:26.909
All right. Take care of her.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:28.244
Hey.

01:02:30.445 --> 01:02:31.780
You're gonna be all right.

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:34.050
I promise you that, okay?

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:37.186
Go visit your grandparents
and have a good time, all right?

01:02:37.219 --> 01:02:40.088
All right. Go.

01:02:40.922 --> 01:02:43.491
Take care, kid.

01:02:43.525 --> 01:02:46.095
<i>-Come on, mija.
-Go.</i>

01:02:46.128 --> 01:02:48.330
You'll be all right.

01:02:48.362 --> 01:02:50.899
Have a safe journey.

01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:23.264
What the heck?

01:03:23.297 --> 01:03:24.899
It's okay.

01:03:24.932 --> 01:03:26.835
Mickey, is that you?

01:03:27.835 --> 01:03:28.837
Yeah, it's me.

01:03:29.538 --> 01:03:31.273
Look, Dora.

01:03:31.306 --> 01:03:36.912
Dora, there's something
going on now.

01:03:36.945 --> 01:03:38.914
I want to talk to you about it.

01:03:38.947 --> 01:03:41.117
I haven't seen you
since I was a kid, you know?

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:47.222
But, I don't want anything
to happen to you.

01:03:49.023 --> 01:03:51.527
There's some very dangerous
people.

01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.596
They might try to hurt you.

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:56.532
Here's 20,000.

01:03:57.164 --> 01:03:59.033
I don't want to go nowhere.

01:03:59.034 --> 01:04:00.302
-Listen to me.
-No...

01:04:00.335 --> 01:04:01.503
-This is serious!
-No, no.

01:04:01.869 --> 01:04:04.405
This is not a joke!
Listen to me.

01:04:04.438 --> 01:04:07.576
Now, you're drunk as usual, but
you're gonna listen to me now.

01:04:07.608 --> 01:04:10.246
You're gonna take this money
and you're going to Ireland

01:04:10.278 --> 01:04:12.481
until I tell you to come back.

01:04:12.514 --> 01:04:15.418
Do you hear me?
This is not a fucking joke.

01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:18.253
-How much?
-20,000.

01:04:18.286 --> 01:04:20.121
-How much?
-20,000.

01:04:20.355 --> 01:04:22.090
-Really?
-Yes.

01:04:22.123 --> 01:04:24.292
Hector, get her ready.
Get her stuff ready.

01:04:24.525 --> 01:04:27.962
Let's get her to the airport.

01:04:27.996 --> 01:04:31.467
There was never any time
for that before. Why now?

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:36.172
Please, get ready. Please.

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:51.453
<i>Chingao.</i>

01:04:54.556 --> 01:04:57.126
Hey, Hector,
where the fuck are ya, holmes?

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.327
Hey, homeboy.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.562
I'm over here in Soto, man,
checking out some firepower.

01:05:00.594 --> 01:05:04.399
Yeah, right. You're probably just
trying to get into that electric car

01:05:04.432 --> 01:05:06.034
all night or something, holmes.

01:05:06.601 --> 01:05:08.269
It's hard to stay away from,
right?

01:05:08.302 --> 01:05:09.371
Think I'll steal it.

01:05:10.505 --> 01:05:12.207
Yeah, wait till you're done
with the job,

01:05:12.239 --> 01:05:13.074
and then, you can steal it.

01:05:15.143 --> 01:05:17.413
All right, hurry up.
I'm waiting on you.

01:05:37.398 --> 01:05:39.234
-Yeah?
-Where's Rudy?

01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:42.137
Rudy is getting ready to blast.

01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:45.273
There's a time for war
and a time for peace.

01:05:45.306 --> 01:05:48.242
<i>Then, war it is.
What you need from me, cariño?</i>

01:05:48.275 --> 01:05:50.611
Hey, I haven't heard from
Hector. Have you heard from him?

01:05:50.644 --> 01:05:52.081
<i>Nada, mijo.</i>

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:57.086
<i>Look, I need you to bring
some fuego in your purse.</i>

01:05:57.119 --> 01:06:00.588
I always have fire in my purse.
I need my soul.

01:06:00.621 --> 01:06:05.126
Hey, I got all the info we
needed. Everything's set up.

01:06:05.159 --> 01:06:07.096
I got Woo King's address.

01:06:07.128 --> 01:06:09.230
He's now in Los Feliz.

01:06:09.264 --> 01:06:11.367
I'll see you guys at Beverly
and Highland, 30 minutes.

01:06:20.641 --> 01:06:24.512
Mickey, we gotta pull into that
park because I left the AKs.

01:06:25.213 --> 01:06:29.118
Hermano, fuck,
you left the AK's in a park?

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:31.185
Fuck.

01:06:31.219 --> 01:06:33.456
All right, just...
We'll go in and get 'em.

01:06:46.134 --> 01:06:47.635
What's wrong?

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.706
That's Mickey Solis's car.
I know it. I know that car.

01:06:51.739 --> 01:06:53.308
He uses it on runs.

01:06:53.541 --> 01:06:56.210
I got his ass!
I got his ass! I got his ass!

01:06:56.244 --> 01:06:58.646
Arresting someone's
worth more than head?

01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:04.019
Arresting Mickey Solis,
I'll get a big bonus.

01:07:04.518 --> 01:07:06.187
Hey, where's my c-note?

01:07:07.155 --> 01:07:09.525
You want to get arrested, bitch?
Get out.

01:07:09.557 --> 01:07:11.326
Get out. Fuck off.

01:07:11.358 --> 01:07:13.161
Fuck off, you bastard.

01:07:25.773 --> 01:07:26.775
Detective.

01:07:27.108 --> 01:07:29.210
I see you made bail.
Where'd you get the dough?

01:07:29.244 --> 01:07:30.713
I thought you'd kinda lost
all your dough

01:07:31.045 --> 01:07:32.647
from that sour deal
that went down last year.

01:07:33.114 --> 01:07:34.682
Well, it's a land of
opportunity,

01:07:34.715 --> 01:07:37.351
and I'm, trying
to make a comeback

01:07:37.385 --> 01:07:39.188
after all my heartache lately.

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:41.456
Where's your boy scouts at?

01:07:41.489 --> 01:07:43.425
I'm off duty, churrosucker.

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:48.262
Well, you know, sir,
discrimination is against the law.

01:07:48.295 --> 01:07:50.631
And so is prostitution.

01:07:50.664 --> 01:07:52.534
I hear that they're doing about,
I don't know,

01:07:52.567 --> 01:07:56.204
about a thousand dollar fine
nowadays?

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:58.640
So, I suppose it's not gonna
make much difference

01:07:58.672 --> 01:08:02.210
if I spill your hot sauce all over
this car, which is probably stolen.

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:03.846
Hey, we're clean.

01:08:05.112 --> 01:08:08.216
Stay in the fuckin' car.
I'm calling this in.

01:08:12.554 --> 01:08:13.289
<i>Chingao.</i>

01:08:15.489 --> 01:08:18.560
Mona, you gotta take this
fuckin' guy and make him good.

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:20.595
Do something, baby.
Sex him up.

01:08:20.627 --> 01:08:22.529
Make it...
Make this shit go away.

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:24.600
<i>We're gonna do nine years, mami
. Go.</i>

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:26.635
Make it happen, baby.

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:29.505
<i>Chingal.</i>

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.743
Okay, 1-Adam-7, 1-Adam-7.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.615
Hey now, hold that...
Hold that call.

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:42.716
<i>Hey, I thought I told you
to get your culo in the car.</i>

01:08:43.518 --> 01:08:46.787
-You got your pillow?
-Yeah, I got it here with me.

01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:48.890
If she don't make it happen,
bro, you gotta blast him.

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:51.460
<i>-You gotta blast him...
-Chingao, man.</i>

01:08:53.862 --> 01:08:58.265
Come on. I can walk a line for
you, if you want.

01:08:58.867 --> 01:08:59.801
Please, come on.

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:02.136
Hey, you look sexy,
but I don't do beaners.

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:03.372
How do you call me?

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.309
Do you think you're gonna stop me
from calling this in, you beanhead?

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:09.812
What do you call me?

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:11.779
What do you call me, bastard?

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:18.886
Fucking make it happen.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.720
Hit him hard.

01:09:23.756 --> 01:09:24.760
Let's go!

01:09:38.907 --> 01:09:42.810
<i>Hermanos, you go in the back,
I go in the front.</i>

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:46.648
-Let's take out Woo King.
-Right on.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.649
Mona, stick with Mickey.
Cover him.

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.920
Are you crazy?
I go with you. You are my man.

01:09:52.252 --> 01:09:53.755
I go with you everywhere.

01:09:53.787 --> 01:09:54.755
Okay, come on.

01:10:21.349 --> 01:10:23.619
I'm asking you one more time
again.

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.221
I won't repeat myself.

01:10:26.453 --> 01:10:28.657
Is there any way
you can send me more security?

01:10:29.256 --> 01:10:30.558
Five is not enough.

01:10:31.359 --> 01:10:34.363
You know these Mexicans.
They're insane.

01:10:34.962 --> 01:10:38.833
Mr. King, no one knows you're
here.

01:10:39.266 --> 01:10:41.569
You are in my house.
It's safe.

01:10:42.703 --> 01:10:44.939
Mr. Solis will never know
you're here.

01:10:44.972 --> 01:10:46.807
You're worried, Mr. King.

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:48.577
The Art of War:

01:10:48.609 --> 01:10:50.746
"The principle controlling
a large army

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.815
is the same as controlling
a few men."

01:12:47.595 --> 01:12:49.831
Woo King!

01:12:49.863 --> 01:12:51.099
You're mine!

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:55.503
Solis, you liar.

01:12:56.671 --> 01:12:57.472
You lied to me.

01:13:23.698 --> 01:13:24.867
You lied to me.

01:13:29.537 --> 01:13:32.474
Come on down, Emperor!
It's your day to die!

01:13:40.081 --> 01:13:42.918
Mickey. Mickey.

01:13:43.618 --> 01:13:45.754
Time to go to the loo.

01:13:49.556 --> 01:13:51.092
The loo?

01:13:54.462 --> 01:13:55.631
Rudy?

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:00.002
Rudy?

01:14:11.445 --> 01:14:13.015
Rudy! Mona!

01:14:45.512 --> 01:14:47.248
Let me cool you off.

01:14:56.890 --> 01:15:00.094
Mr. Solis, I am only a rose.

01:15:00.862 --> 01:15:05.667
Should a rose suffer
because it nears the thorns?

01:15:05.699 --> 01:15:08.237
Fuck your Chinese philosophy.

01:15:10.637 --> 01:15:14.609
Mr. Solis, I negotiated
your mother's safety.

01:16:07.127 --> 01:16:09.197
Rudy?

01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:11.265
Mona?

01:16:18.038 --> 01:16:20.975
Rudy! Rudy!

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:22.677
Mona!

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:13.261
Rudy.

01:17:13.293 --> 01:17:16.230
Mona.

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:17.733
<i>Venganza!</i>

01:17:34.414 --> 01:17:36.251
Do you know, Mickey?

01:17:37.417 --> 01:17:40.755
Do you know what plans we have
with your granddaughter?

01:17:42.856 --> 01:17:45.126
When we steal her,

01:17:45.158 --> 01:17:48.395
we're going to make sweet
one six million dollars

01:17:48.429 --> 01:17:51.099
for one movie.

01:17:51.131 --> 01:17:55.136
Russians pay top dollars, snuff
film from your granddaughter.

01:17:56.136 --> 01:17:59.073
Come on, I got something sweet
for you!

01:17:59.106 --> 01:18:01.109
The taste of your own blood!

01:18:06.913 --> 01:18:10.786
You die today,
you fuckin' evil bastard!

01:18:51.425 --> 01:18:55.831
Chinese, we're the smartest
race.

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:59.333
We shall overcome all.

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:03.837
The dragon shall consume
Mexico and America.

01:19:03.871 --> 01:19:06.240
It shall consume it like a fire,

01:19:07.274 --> 01:19:10.311
and take its gold, its land,
even its children.

01:19:11.345 --> 01:19:13.515
You shall bow before our feet.

01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:15.484
We shall be like a god.

01:19:15.949 --> 01:19:17.284
God!

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:39.941
Hey!

01:20:02.863 --> 01:20:06.433
Mr. Harrison, please, turn
around.

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:10.105
I have your final payment for
you.

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:14.341
I remember you said that you
loved the Mexican community,

01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:16.344
that you embraced it.

01:20:18.912 --> 01:20:22.550
But you forgot one thing, one
word.
