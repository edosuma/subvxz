00:06.996 --> 00:08.514
I know what you're like
when you're left alone!

00:08.631 --> 00:09.829
You're acting crazy!

00:09.912 --> 00:11.436
As usual, you have
acted impulsively!

00:11.541 --> 00:15.369
Most of your questionable
behaviour is beyond explanation.

00:15.445 --> 00:19.122
You are not allowed to be
alone with clients.

00:19.301 --> 00:21.936
You are to stick
to the script in meetings.

00:22.253 --> 00:24.512
And you will report to Lou.

00:24.618 --> 00:26.337
I thought we had an
understanding about Don.

00:26.489 --> 00:28.228
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

Good morning.

01:47.964 --> 01:49.834
Plans for the weekend?

01:49.868 --> 01:52.136
- California?
- Next weekend.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.841
I want you to know
I haven't forgotten

01:55.876 --> 01:57.745
your request
regarding Handi-Wrap.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.251
I spoke to Lou and he's very happy
to have you on the business.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.989
And, of course, you can
assume from our conversation

02:04.023 --> 02:06.359
- that I am, too.
- Thank you.

02:06.393 --> 02:09.596
I hope you understand
I mean on the team.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.666
That's exactly
what I asked for.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.709
Stop humming!
You're not happy!

02:22.914 --> 02:24.416
Do you want me
to introduce you?

02:24.451 --> 02:25.951
I'm not interested in her.

02:25.985 --> 02:29.017
She belongs to it
and it belongs to her.

02:29.051 --> 02:32.117
- What is "it"?
- What, am I Cassandra?

02:32.152 --> 02:36.255
That machine came for us.
And one by one...

02:39.293 --> 02:41.324
- Good morning.
- Morning.

02:41.359 --> 02:43.058
Morning, lovely.

02:43.093 --> 02:44.994
What's wrong?

02:45.029 --> 02:47.431
Do you know anything
about this?

02:50.502 --> 02:52.069
Where did you get this?

02:52.103 --> 02:54.370
I found it on
the Xerox machine.

02:54.405 --> 02:57.343
And I thought,
"Wow, Shirley's gonna be

02:57.377 --> 03:00.110
in a lot of trouble
for leaving it there."

03:00.145 --> 03:02.577
- It's sensational stuff.
- I didn't leave it there.

03:02.611 --> 03:03.944
But I appreciate its return.

03:03.978 --> 03:05.745
It's got to be pretty recent.

03:05.779 --> 03:07.512
He's got one about
Eisenhower's funeral.

03:07.547 --> 03:11.014
I'm sure he'd prefer
you hadn't seen this.

03:11.049 --> 03:13.717
Hmm, that's not
what Dr. Freud would say.

03:13.751 --> 03:16.350
No one has seen this.

03:18.386 --> 03:19.721
"Scout's Honor."

03:21.555 --> 03:22.822
Mr. Ginsberg?

03:22.857 --> 03:24.457
This thing's on the fritz.

03:29.967 --> 03:32.603
S-T-R-A-T-E-G-Y.

03:32.637 --> 03:34.339
Meredith, honey, I don't
want that spelled out,

03:34.373 --> 03:35.808
I just want it spelled right.

03:35.842 --> 03:37.843
<i>Mr. Draper.</i>

03:39.346 --> 03:41.048
I was just talking to you.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.552
<i>There's a Stephanie Horton</i>
<i>calling collect.</i>

03:43.586 --> 03:45.121
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>to accept the charges?</i>

03:45.156 --> 03:46.890
<i>She says she's your niece.</i>

03:46.924 --> 03:49.058
Yes.
Yes, absolutely.

03:53.063 --> 03:54.763
Hello, Stephanie.
It's Don.

03:54.798 --> 03:58.001
I wasn't sure
if you'd remember me.

03:59.471 --> 04:01.240
Come on.
How are you?

04:01.274 --> 04:04.742
How are you... Don?

04:04.776 --> 04:08.514
About the same.
Is everything okay?

04:08.548 --> 04:10.815
Well...

04:10.849 --> 04:14.116
I suppose it probably sounds
like an emergency,

04:14.151 --> 04:16.886
but it's not. I thought
of you because, well--

04:16.920 --> 04:19.588
it's not an emergency.

04:19.623 --> 04:21.724
You're making it sound
like an emergency, sweetheart.

04:23.660 --> 04:25.663
I'm pregnant.

04:25.697 --> 04:27.565
<i>I'm expecting.</i>

04:27.600 --> 04:29.765
And I'm running out
of bread and...

04:31.633 --> 04:35.134
I hate that this is why I'm talking
to you after all this time.

04:35.169 --> 04:37.403
I'm glad you called me.

04:37.438 --> 04:39.105
That's what I'm here for.

04:39.139 --> 04:41.073
I mean, you're my...

04:41.107 --> 04:43.275
what'd you call yourself?
My niece.

04:43.309 --> 04:45.945
I don't know why I said that.

04:45.979 --> 04:47.915
No, that's what you are.

04:47.949 --> 04:50.281
I like that.

04:50.316 --> 04:51.581
Are you still in Berkeley?

04:51.615 --> 04:54.915
I'm in LA.
That's where I ended up.

04:54.949 --> 04:57.550
It's gonna be fine.
Do you have a pen?

04:57.585 --> 04:59.485
How far along are you?

04:59.519 --> 05:02.187
I think around seven months.

05:02.221 --> 05:04.490
But my mom says I came early.

05:06.226 --> 05:08.759
My wife, her name is Megan
Draper, lives in LA.

05:08.794 --> 05:09.960
Can you get to Laurel Canyon?

05:09.993 --> 05:13.261
I've got a car.
You got married again?

05:13.296 --> 05:15.133
Yes.

05:15.167 --> 05:16.867
She's gonna take care of you.

05:16.902 --> 05:18.969
I want you to stay there.
I'm coming out tonight.

05:19.003 --> 05:20.304
I don't know.

05:20.338 --> 05:23.107
I want to see you.
It's not up for debate.

05:25.207 --> 05:27.508
Thank you, Dick.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.518
You may find the time
by dialing

05:38.553 --> 05:41.356
Meridian 7-1-2-1-2.

05:41.390 --> 05:44.326
I'm sorry, can I speak
to Megan, please?

05:48.262 --> 05:50.897
- <i> Hello.</i>
- Listen, I'm coming out tonight.

05:50.932 --> 05:53.569
Oh, okay.
Is everything okay?

05:53.603 --> 05:56.805
Not really. You're gonna get a
visit from Stephanie Horton.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.173
She's Anna Draper's niece.

05:59.207 --> 06:01.508
She's expecting and she's alone

06:01.542 --> 06:03.643
and she needs money
and I should see her.

06:03.677 --> 06:06.079
Poor thing.

06:06.113 --> 06:08.948
I'll cancel my party
and you can catch up.

06:08.983 --> 06:10.250
What party?

06:10.284 --> 06:12.719
You said you weren't
coming this weekend,

06:12.753 --> 06:14.787
so I'm having the party
for my acting class.

06:14.822 --> 06:17.025
- Tonight?
- Tomorrow night.

06:17.059 --> 06:19.296
But I don't need to have it.

06:19.330 --> 06:22.164
Or you can come.
Stephanie can come.

06:22.199 --> 06:24.567
Don't worry about it.
We'll stay out of your way.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.104
You don't have to pick me up.
I'll be in by 10:00.

06:27.139 --> 06:30.142
I'm so sorry, Don.
We'll make her feel at home.

06:30.177 --> 06:31.511
Who's there with you?

06:31.546 --> 06:33.647
Amy from Delaware.

06:35.015 --> 06:36.214
Could you get rid of her?

06:36.249 --> 06:37.749
I'd rather keep this
a family matter.

06:37.783 --> 06:39.283
Okay.

06:41.085 --> 06:43.053
I'm sorry this is the reason,

06:43.088 --> 06:45.155
but I'm glad I get to see you.

06:45.189 --> 06:48.090
Me, too. Bye.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.360
Oop.

06:53.528 --> 06:56.295
Burger Chef's mascot
Little Chef is a flop

06:56.330 --> 06:57.964
because he's, what,
another chef?

06:57.999 --> 07:00.702
He doesn't eat the
burgers, he cooks them.

07:00.736 --> 07:03.704
But what if you replaced
him with a fresh recruit?

07:03.738 --> 07:06.571
A saucy little retard
named Scout.

07:06.605 --> 07:08.606
He can't work
at a hamburger stand.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.173
He can take anything
but an order.

07:13.212 --> 07:15.314
Hey, Don.

07:15.349 --> 07:17.616
Stan, once the smoke clears,

07:17.650 --> 07:19.286
I need you to rush some
things out for Handi-Wrap.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.423
- I need it by 4:00.
- Mmm.

07:21.457 --> 07:24.057
I'm really, truly busy.

07:24.092 --> 07:26.994
_

07:27.028 --> 07:28.663
What the hell is that?

07:30.434 --> 07:32.300
Turns out Lou thinks
he's Mort Drucker.

07:32.335 --> 07:35.702
- Mort Walker.
- How'd you get this?

07:35.736 --> 07:39.107
It wasn't our fault. Why is
Scout always up to no good?

07:39.142 --> 07:40.875
He peeled a bag of grapefruits.

07:40.910 --> 07:43.177
Thought they were potatoes.

07:43.211 --> 07:44.745
I'm gonna get rid of this.

07:44.779 --> 07:47.782
He left it on the Xerox. He
obviously wanted us to have a copy.

07:47.816 --> 07:49.951
You're just gonna
force me to draw my own.

07:49.985 --> 07:52.554
I've got a plane to catch.
Get to work.

07:55.327 --> 07:56.993
Don's still part
of the faculty.

07:57.028 --> 07:59.895
Naw, he's gonna
stroke to 'em later.

08:02.933 --> 08:04.969
Why don't you let
Loretta do that?

08:05.004 --> 08:08.271
She can handle the homework.
I'll handle the silver.

08:08.305 --> 08:11.209
What'd you land on?

08:11.244 --> 08:14.876
Rumaki, Crab Louie
on toast points,

08:14.911 --> 08:16.979
and little franks
in barbecue sauce.

08:17.015 --> 08:19.584
You know they've got four more
houses to visit after us?

08:19.618 --> 08:22.319
I wanted to go first
to put everyone at ease.

08:22.353 --> 08:24.153
They get so
tongue-tied around us.

08:24.188 --> 08:27.259
They can only pretend so long
we're just "regular neighbors."

08:29.629 --> 08:31.397
Could you stock the bar?

08:34.732 --> 08:37.667
Hi. Did you have
any trouble finding us?

08:37.701 --> 08:39.936
No.

08:44.446 --> 08:46.144
I'm Megan, by the way.

08:46.178 --> 08:48.647
I'm Stephanie.

08:52.122 --> 08:54.189
You are so beautiful.

08:54.224 --> 08:55.857
I know, I'm a Madonna.

08:57.126 --> 09:01.096
But you are truly magnetic.

09:01.131 --> 09:02.364
What do you do?

09:02.399 --> 09:05.167
Don didn't tell you?
I'm an actress.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.106
Uh, welcome.

09:09.909 --> 09:11.409
I'm grateful.

09:11.443 --> 09:13.409
For some reason,
I'm not crying, man.

09:13.444 --> 09:15.313
Well, why don't I fix
you something to eat

09:15.348 --> 09:17.215
and then you can take
a shower if you want?

09:17.249 --> 09:19.615
- Is it that bad?
- No!

09:19.649 --> 09:21.451
I don't know.

09:21.486 --> 09:23.156
I think you'd want to relax.

09:23.190 --> 09:26.126
Don didn't say much about your
situation other than the obvious.

09:26.161 --> 09:29.196
Your place is out of sight.

09:29.230 --> 09:31.565
I'm at a flop
in MacArthur Park,

09:31.599 --> 09:34.170
but I'm headed up to Oakland
with a little help.

09:34.205 --> 09:36.706
I have some friends there and one
of them's old man's a doctor.

09:36.740 --> 09:39.408
So, assume
it's no trouble at all.

09:39.442 --> 09:42.508
What's your pleasure?
Grilled cheese? Spaghetti?

09:42.543 --> 09:46.113
Do you have any meat?
I've been dreaming about it.

09:46.148 --> 09:48.051
Sure.

09:48.085 --> 09:50.619
Now you go into the bedroom
back there.

09:50.653 --> 09:52.588
I changed the sheets.
There are towels.

09:52.622 --> 09:54.687
You can lie down, run a bath,

09:54.722 --> 09:57.490
whatever you want.
Make yourself at home.

09:57.524 --> 09:59.959
Thank you.
I'm pretty beat.

10:11.541 --> 10:13.375
You know I want her.

10:13.409 --> 10:15.411
You can't have her.

10:15.445 --> 10:17.078
Why can't I have her?

10:17.112 --> 10:19.479
Because Scout's on 'er.

10:45.672 --> 10:47.373
Nice of you to join us.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.516
Don, why don't you take the
mound, throw out the first pitch?

10:54.550 --> 10:56.315
Sure.

10:56.349 --> 11:00.354
Stan has some
very preliminary work.

11:00.388 --> 11:02.422
Stan?

11:02.456 --> 11:05.592
Should I move over there or do
you want to come over here?

11:05.626 --> 11:07.894
I don't know, Stan. Can you
be smug from over there?

11:09.997 --> 11:11.464
Lou, I don't know
what you think you heard.

11:11.498 --> 11:13.266
I heard everything!

11:13.300 --> 11:16.371
From your first fart
to your last dying breath.

11:16.406 --> 11:19.006
You think it's funny?

11:19.039 --> 11:21.442
I apologize deeply.

11:21.476 --> 11:23.378
What happened?

11:23.412 --> 11:25.345
Let me ask you, Peggy.

11:25.379 --> 11:27.545
- You ever heard of Underdog?
- The cartoon?

11:27.580 --> 11:29.714
Yeah.
Sweet Polly Purebred.

11:29.749 --> 11:31.183
Saturday morning.

11:31.217 --> 11:33.119
It makes hundreds of thousands
of dollars a year.

11:33.153 --> 11:36.555
Mostly for its creator Chet
Stover of Dancer Fitzgerald.

11:36.590 --> 11:39.225
- Did you know him there?
- He was nothing special.

11:39.259 --> 11:41.794
"Scout's Honor"
is 100 times better.

11:41.828 --> 11:45.025
I can tell you right now,
it's a winner.

11:46.461 --> 11:49.695
You know who had a ridiculous
dream and people laughed at him?

11:49.729 --> 11:53.127
You?

11:53.162 --> 11:54.829
What?

11:54.863 --> 11:57.533
Oh, I did not mean that
the way it sounded.

11:57.567 --> 12:01.070
I mean, if you're telling us
that this is your dream,

12:01.104 --> 12:04.271
I apologize for being one
of those naysaying idiots.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.739
I hate people like that.

12:07.342 --> 12:09.476
Bob Dylan.

12:09.510 --> 12:11.214
Is he hip enough for you?

12:11.248 --> 12:13.549
He was 20 years old when he
wrote "Blowin' in the Wind"

12:13.584 --> 12:15.617
and he's a genius.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.985
Look at where he is,
look at where you are.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.491
You know what?

12:21.526 --> 12:24.026
You're a bunch of
flag-burning snots.

12:24.060 --> 12:27.428
You've got a thing to learn
about patriotism and loyalty.

12:27.462 --> 12:30.534
The very fabric of "Scout's
Honor" is a joke to you.

12:32.036 --> 12:33.636
We're gonna have
this meeting later.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.775
So order dinner because
I want finished work.

12:38.078 --> 12:39.478
And if any of you
don't like it,

12:39.513 --> 12:42.012
you can thank your
hilarious friends here.

12:58.928 --> 13:01.431
Last flight's at 9:00.
Put me on that.

13:01.466 --> 13:04.066
- I'll cancel my plans.
- Just mine, not yours.

13:05.634 --> 13:07.300
I don't know if it's vandals

13:07.335 --> 13:09.236
or just kids being kids.

13:09.270 --> 13:10.804
What is it?

13:10.839 --> 13:13.340
Someone broke all the
streetlights on Peck Avenue.

13:13.374 --> 13:15.040
And you want Henry
to get them fixed?

13:15.075 --> 13:18.109
No. Mike was just saying
it's a national disease.

13:18.143 --> 13:20.077
The wildness of the kids.

13:20.111 --> 13:21.945
I just don't expect it
in Westchester.

13:21.979 --> 13:25.114
I know all everyone wants
to talk about is Vietnam,

13:25.148 --> 13:28.384
but things are
falling apart here, too.

13:28.419 --> 13:30.451
The rumaki is exquisite.

13:30.485 --> 13:32.452
Thank you.

13:32.487 --> 13:35.324
Well, I don't know, that
those things are unrelated.

13:35.359 --> 13:38.159
I mean, first the kids
start off protesting

13:38.193 --> 13:41.197
and the next thing you know every
authority is up for grabs.

13:41.231 --> 13:43.933
I mean, if they learned
how to support their country,

13:43.967 --> 13:46.967
sacrifice in hard times, we'd
have the morale to win the war.

13:47.002 --> 13:49.804
Mike, you have plans
for the summer?

13:49.839 --> 13:52.509
Even Nixon wants to bring
the war to an end.

13:52.544 --> 13:54.344
I'm surprised, Henry.

13:54.379 --> 13:56.747
Don't be, Mike.
I agree with Nixon.

13:56.781 --> 13:58.948
I think it's too costly.

13:58.983 --> 14:00.717
It has to be done
on the right terms,

14:00.751 --> 14:02.652
but I think we should get out
while the getting's good.

14:02.686 --> 14:04.352
Since when?

14:04.386 --> 14:06.854
I've always supported
the president, honey.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.331
I think that maybe everyone
should fill up here.

14:12.365 --> 14:14.701
I don't know
if my lamb turned out.

14:14.735 --> 14:16.636
I'm sure it's delicious.

14:16.670 --> 14:18.771
Let me check the Sterno.

14:27.180 --> 14:30.115
Well, I think I worked
every side of the strategy.

14:31.586 --> 14:33.657
Don, you've been the boss.

14:33.691 --> 14:36.994
The briefcase and the hat,
that's a rookie maneuver.

14:37.029 --> 14:38.696
You got someplace to be?

14:38.730 --> 14:41.029
I'm afraid I do.

14:41.063 --> 14:43.233
How's it going to look
for them if I let you go?

14:43.267 --> 14:44.835
Well, you could let
everybody go.

14:44.870 --> 14:46.337
Is that what you would do?

14:46.371 --> 14:49.074
No, I'd let <i> you</i> go, Lou.

14:50.410 --> 14:53.145
Well, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

14:53.179 --> 14:56.314
I'm gonna do you the
courtesy of reading these

14:56.348 --> 14:59.650
so that you can continue to work on them
instead of coming up with new things,

14:59.684 --> 15:02.153
because I'm gonna
tuck you in tonight.

15:05.958 --> 15:07.658
About your cartoon.

15:07.693 --> 15:09.626
Here we go.

15:09.660 --> 15:12.828
This is an office made out of people
who have problems with authority.

15:12.862 --> 15:15.597
You know you have to have a thick
skin, but don't help them.

15:15.631 --> 15:19.067
I'm not taking management
advice from Don Draper.

15:28.212 --> 15:29.780
Hello.

15:29.814 --> 15:31.848
I can't get out
of here tonight.

15:31.883 --> 15:34.182
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:34.216 --> 15:37.153
- Is she there yet?
- She's taking a bath.

15:37.188 --> 15:38.389
How is she?

15:38.423 --> 15:40.158
She's pretty far along.

15:40.193 --> 15:42.963
So beautiful.

15:42.997 --> 15:46.335
Well, don't bother her. Tell her
I'll see her in the morning.

15:46.370 --> 15:48.374
Don't worry.
I made her a steak.

15:48.408 --> 15:50.075
Thank you.

15:54.243 --> 15:56.444
Okay, I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

15:56.479 --> 15:57.813
Okay.

15:59.783 --> 16:01.850
Damn, that smells good.

16:03.622 --> 16:06.089
Don's stuck in New York. He's
flying in tomorrow morning.

16:06.124 --> 16:08.324
Was that him?

16:08.359 --> 16:11.029
Yeah, he's frustrated.
I told him not to worry.

16:12.566 --> 16:14.268
Wait, do you want
to eat outside?

16:14.303 --> 16:16.636
I do that all the time.

16:20.038 --> 16:21.739
I love that you're
wearing Anna's ring.

16:21.774 --> 16:24.244
Oh, yes.
It's beautiful.

16:26.548 --> 16:28.514
I'm sorry I never met her.

16:28.549 --> 16:30.750
She's around.
Believe me, you've met her.

16:30.785 --> 16:32.920
She's happy it's in the family.

16:32.954 --> 16:36.155
Well, maybe you'll have
someone there to give it to.

16:36.189 --> 16:38.123
Oh, no.
It's yours now

16:38.158 --> 16:39.825
You'll probably have
someone of your own.

16:39.859 --> 16:42.731
We'll see.
I don't know.

16:42.765 --> 16:45.468
Don's kids are plenty for me.

16:47.405 --> 16:49.307
I haven't eaten meat in a year.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.276
I don't think
this is a good idea.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.142
I can make spaghetti.

16:54.643 --> 16:57.446
It's probably hard
with you here and him there.

16:59.016 --> 17:00.850
Are you with someone?

17:00.884 --> 17:04.051
Not right now.
He was a musician.

17:04.086 --> 17:05.686
They're the worst.

17:05.722 --> 17:08.859
Dropped out of school.
Followed him down here.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.962
Started flush at the beach,

17:10.997 --> 17:13.632
ended up downtown panhandling.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.506
And then he got busted
dealing grass

17:16.540 --> 17:19.275
and we celebrated
before he went away.

17:19.309 --> 17:21.611
He'll be out in a month.

17:21.646 --> 17:24.549
So will this little guy.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.217
Does he know?

17:26.251 --> 17:27.585
No.

17:27.618 --> 17:29.953
I'm afraid he'd murder
someone just to stay in jail.

17:31.521 --> 17:33.889
- I won't tell Don.
- Oh, I don't care.

17:33.923 --> 17:35.624
I know all of his secrets.

17:41.898 --> 17:44.899
But you don't
know <i> him</i> very well.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.633
You're right.
You're right.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.503
It's just I'm looking at you

17:51.537 --> 17:54.504
and seeing how, well,
disorganized this all is.

17:54.539 --> 17:56.105
And I don't think
he'd stand for that.

17:56.140 --> 17:59.543
I don't think he'd trust you
to make your own plans.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.349
I don't know what I'm doing here.
This is a dumb idea.

18:04.383 --> 18:07.587
No, no, I mean,
he wants to help,

18:07.621 --> 18:10.521
I'm sure, in his way.
We both do.

18:22.367 --> 18:25.033
I'm going to give you...

18:26.969 --> 18:29.671
would $1,000
get you far enough?

18:29.706 --> 18:32.507
That's very generous.

18:32.541 --> 18:35.009
This comes with no strings.

18:36.777 --> 18:38.676
Thank you.

18:42.015 --> 18:44.883
I really think
it's better this way.

18:44.917 --> 18:48.054
You're right.
I'm gonna take off.

18:48.088 --> 18:49.589
You haven't eaten anything yet.

18:49.623 --> 18:52.723
I guess I got what I came for.

18:52.758 --> 18:54.359
There's no rush.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.701
Nothing ever happened
between us, you know.

18:59.736 --> 19:01.904
Of course not.

19:01.939 --> 19:04.938
You're his niece.
I know that.

19:18.898 --> 19:20.399
The children are asleep.

19:20.434 --> 19:23.570
- What about your headache?
- Keep your voice down.

19:23.604 --> 19:25.473
I did not appreciate going stag

19:25.507 --> 19:28.109
to four people's homes
whom I barely know.

19:28.144 --> 19:31.448
I'm sorry. I wasn't feeling well.
You didn't have to go.

19:33.018 --> 19:34.784
Hey, "Emily Post."

19:34.819 --> 19:36.785
Why were you
talking about the war?

19:36.819 --> 19:38.617
I didn't bring it up.

19:38.651 --> 19:40.851
But maybe I should more because
I didn't know where you stood.

19:40.886 --> 19:42.253
I shouldn't have to brief you

19:42.287 --> 19:44.622
because you shouldn't be
talking about those things.

19:44.656 --> 19:46.390
I'm not a dinner companion.

19:46.424 --> 19:47.791
I'm their elected
representative.

19:47.825 --> 19:50.492
- You ran unopposed.
- We'll see if that lasts.

19:50.527 --> 19:52.593
From now on, keep your
conversation to how much you hate

19:52.627 --> 19:55.529
getting toast crumbs in the butter
and leave the thinking to me.

19:58.401 --> 20:01.201
Henry!

20:01.236 --> 20:03.338
I'm sorry. It just
caught me off-guard.

20:03.373 --> 20:06.475
Well, you embarrassed
yourself way more than me.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.953
You know what?

20:20.987 --> 20:23.289
I decided I can
see that Monday.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.721
Good night.

20:44.241 --> 20:45.942
Hello.

20:45.976 --> 20:48.375
What?

20:52.181 --> 20:54.546
Is she okay?

21:00.720 --> 21:02.722
Hello?

21:02.757 --> 21:04.090
Oh, hi.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.227
- Who are you?
- I'm Amy.

21:08.262 --> 21:10.896
- We met on the phone.
- Is Megan here?

21:10.931 --> 21:13.198
Oh, Don.
I...

21:13.233 --> 21:15.000
Amy, do you mind?

21:15.034 --> 21:17.604
I'll just use the ladies'.

21:20.841 --> 21:23.775
I'm sorry, but she left.

21:23.809 --> 21:25.880
You told her
I wanted to see her?

21:25.914 --> 21:27.517
I really tried
to get her to stay.

21:27.551 --> 21:29.819
But the money already came up

21:29.853 --> 21:31.551
and I gave her $1,000.

21:31.586 --> 21:33.520
She must have been embarrassed.

21:33.554 --> 21:35.722
She said she'd call
you from Oakland.

21:35.757 --> 21:38.158
You should have called me.
At least let me talk to her.

21:38.193 --> 21:40.262
She's an adult, Don.

21:44.734 --> 21:46.601
Do you want to go
to the market with us?

21:46.635 --> 21:48.669
You know, I'm gonna
have company tonight.

21:48.703 --> 21:50.337
Maybe it'll cheer you up.

21:52.839 --> 21:55.140
We'll go.
Amy.

21:57.676 --> 22:00.579
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

22:00.613 --> 22:02.848
- We should go.
- Anything for you, Don?

22:02.882 --> 22:05.251
I know what he likes.

23:14.087 --> 23:16.086
We're back.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.058
- Let me see.
- She's fine.

23:21.093 --> 23:22.725
Couple of black eyes.

23:24.027 --> 23:26.994
Ow.
Can I go lie down?

23:27.028 --> 23:28.795
I want to know
what really happened.

23:28.830 --> 23:31.096
They were sword fighting
with golf clubs.

23:31.130 --> 23:33.600
- We're idiots, okay?
- You are.

23:33.635 --> 23:35.337
You can't be
trusted on your own.

23:35.371 --> 23:36.572
That's your face, young lady.

23:36.607 --> 23:38.475
That's right, it's <i> my</i> face.

23:38.510 --> 23:41.880
- Why am I even here?
- Girls! Girls! Please.

23:41.914 --> 23:45.419
Sally, you can understand how your mother
and I are both worried about your nose.

23:45.453 --> 23:48.790
Yeah, I know, because where would
Mom be without her perfect nose?

23:48.824 --> 23:50.794
She wouldn't find
a man like you.

23:50.828 --> 23:52.697
She'd be nothing.

23:52.732 --> 23:55.000
It <i> was</i> a perfect nose.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.766
And <i> I</i> gave it to you.

23:56.801 --> 23:58.770
You're lucky Henry
is important enough

23:58.805 --> 24:00.806
to get Dr. Kramer
to fix it this weekend.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.376
I suppose you'd rather do
it in a barn in Farmington.

24:03.410 --> 24:05.745
It's a nose job,
not an abortion.

24:05.779 --> 24:08.447
- I'm going to break your arm next.
- Betty!

24:08.481 --> 24:10.181
Don't worry about me
finding a man.

24:10.214 --> 24:12.215
I already have you
to keep me in line.

24:12.250 --> 24:15.119
You're going to your room and you're
going to wait there until morning.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.487
Good, I prefer it.

24:31.296 --> 24:32.899
Hello.

24:32.933 --> 24:34.866
Just a minute.

24:34.901 --> 24:36.433
It's for Megan again.

24:36.467 --> 24:38.868
Megan?

24:38.903 --> 24:41.037
It's Greenblatt's.

24:43.538 --> 24:44.737
Hello.

24:52.779 --> 24:55.581
The main door was open and you
didn't check the peephole?

24:55.615 --> 24:56.849
It's a bad neighborhood.

24:56.884 --> 24:58.084
What are you doing here?

24:58.118 --> 24:59.851
I wanted to tell you--

24:59.885 --> 25:01.752
May I?

25:01.786 --> 25:03.421
Michael.

25:03.456 --> 25:05.859
I was just in the office and
there's something going on.

25:05.893 --> 25:07.495
- What?
- The computer.

25:07.530 --> 25:10.529
It's Saturday.
Take the day off.

25:10.564 --> 25:12.663
That's right. So why
were Lou and Cutler

25:12.698 --> 25:14.731
having a secret meeting in
that air-conditioned lair?

25:14.765 --> 25:17.637
- I don't know.
- But I do.

25:17.671 --> 25:19.206
They're homos.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.175
Okay.

25:21.209 --> 25:22.909
Anything else to report?

25:22.944 --> 25:24.444
Peggy, it's serious.

25:24.478 --> 25:26.648
That machine makes men
do unnatural things.

25:26.682 --> 25:28.084
What did you see?

25:33.057 --> 25:34.725
- Who are you?
- This is Julio.

25:34.759 --> 25:36.730
- Hello.
- Hey.

25:36.764 --> 25:39.331
I'd like to say Peggy's mentioned
you at work, but she hasn't.

25:39.365 --> 25:41.166
Julio lives upstairs.

25:41.199 --> 25:43.935
Interesting arrangement.
Very modern.

25:43.970 --> 25:45.373
I live with my mama.

25:45.407 --> 25:47.076
I live with my pop,

25:47.110 --> 25:48.778
which is why I can't
work at home.

25:48.812 --> 25:51.146
Can I please work here?
I can't go back to the office.

25:51.180 --> 25:53.016
Not right now.
I'll stay out of your way.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.686
Fine.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.086
Can I use your typewriter?

25:58.120 --> 26:00.122
It's too loud.

26:18.022 --> 26:20.387
<i>♪ you've treated me so kind ♪</i>

26:20.421 --> 26:23.053
<i>♪ I'm about to lose my mind ♪</i>

26:23.088 --> 26:27.789
<i>♪ you make me so very happy ♪</i>

26:27.824 --> 26:30.791
<i>♪ I'm so glad you ♪</i>

26:30.826 --> 26:32.626
<i>♪ came into my life... ♪</i>

26:32.660 --> 26:35.126
I wouldn't have invited
them both if I had known.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.530
I swear, I thought she
was his daughter.

26:37.564 --> 26:40.202
Don't you kind of want
to see what happens?

26:46.012 --> 26:48.015
I'm doing fine.

26:52.020 --> 26:54.354
I don't think
you are doing fine.

26:57.057 --> 26:58.525
Maybe I'm not in the mood.

27:04.298 --> 27:06.930
This is why I never
invite musicians.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.115
Boo!

27:21.018 --> 27:23.922
What a merry band
of players we are.

27:23.956 --> 27:25.860
So you're an actress, too?

27:25.894 --> 27:28.699
I will be
if someone will let me.

27:48.361 --> 27:49.661
Come on.

28:04.206 --> 28:06.205
Come on in.

28:53.804 --> 28:55.804
Want another drink?

28:55.838 --> 28:57.872
Is that Harry?

29:04.385 --> 29:06.354
Don. Megan.

29:07.926 --> 29:09.895
I'm sorry.

29:09.929 --> 29:11.696
Miranda here
invited me to a party.

29:11.730 --> 29:12.965
I didn't know this was it.

29:12.999 --> 29:14.401
Hi, Miranda.

29:14.435 --> 29:16.201
This place is out of sight.

29:16.236 --> 29:18.570
I've been trying to help
Miranda find an agent.

29:18.605 --> 29:20.207
You're so helpful.

29:22.009 --> 29:24.210
Harry, what do you say
we go get a drink?

29:25.814 --> 29:29.016
- Do you mind?
- No, of course not.

29:29.051 --> 29:30.719
As long as Harry drives.

29:30.753 --> 29:33.958
Well, I-- We--

29:33.992 --> 29:37.028
Should I bring Miranda along?

29:37.063 --> 29:38.697
Do you want to?

29:40.767 --> 29:43.268
Sorry, honey.

29:43.302 --> 29:46.138
We'll get you a ride.

29:56.218 --> 29:58.052
She better not
catch you in here.

29:58.086 --> 30:00.221
But then I'm not
gonna get to see you.

30:00.255 --> 30:03.091
That's the way Betty likes it.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.198
Are they gonna get divorced?

30:06.233 --> 30:07.866
What? No.

30:07.900 --> 30:10.368
They're the Dynamic Duo.

30:10.402 --> 30:12.669
That's never going to happen.

30:12.703 --> 30:16.206
The other night, they were
really screaming at each other.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.640
I saw Henry take
a pillow to the den.

30:18.674 --> 30:21.978
I'm gonna hitch
back to school tonight.

30:22.012 --> 30:23.547
Can I come with you?

30:23.581 --> 30:25.480
You want to run away?

30:27.549 --> 30:30.185
I have a stomach ache
all the time.

30:35.091 --> 30:37.026
You're not gonna piss, are you?

30:37.060 --> 30:39.629
I don't do that anymore.

30:42.634 --> 30:44.269
I'm sorry.

30:44.303 --> 30:46.739
They'll never let you out.

30:46.774 --> 30:49.975
You're too little.

31:00.389 --> 31:02.258
- Michael.
- I'm sorry.

31:02.292 --> 31:04.325
The kid left an hour ago.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.459
It's interesting because
first you were dead,

31:06.494 --> 31:08.996
then all this activity
started in your eyelids.

31:09.030 --> 31:10.765
Time to go.

31:10.799 --> 31:12.999
There's this pressure
in my head

31:13.033 --> 31:15.467
like there's a hydrogen
bomb that's gonna go off.

31:15.501 --> 31:19.472
And then I realize
it's that hum in the office.

31:19.507 --> 31:21.242
It's getting to me.

31:21.277 --> 31:22.809
I caught myself looking
at Stan's shoulders

31:22.844 --> 31:25.208
and getting, you know, excited.

31:25.242 --> 31:28.342
- Really?
- That's the computer's plan.

31:28.377 --> 31:30.245
Turn us all homo.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.479
Peggy, we got to reproduce.

31:34.246 --> 31:37.214
If there was a way to do it
without having sex, I'd do it.

31:37.248 --> 31:39.583
Stop it!

31:39.617 --> 31:41.049
You have to leave.

31:41.083 --> 31:44.218
Great. What am I doing?
It's building up.

31:44.253 --> 31:46.086
Well, maybe you should
see a doctor or something.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.120
Why?
'Cause I want you?

31:48.154 --> 31:50.054
No, because you're not right.

31:50.088 --> 31:52.590
Did you notice the radio
doesn't work in there anymore?

31:52.625 --> 31:54.393
That's not my imagination.

31:54.427 --> 31:56.226
It's just a computer!

32:02.336 --> 32:04.037
No, you're right.

32:04.071 --> 32:06.204
I'm gonna go.

32:15.581 --> 32:17.983
You don't have to report
this information.

32:19.888 --> 32:21.322
Good night.

32:30.161 --> 32:32.564
This is so much better.

32:37.364 --> 32:39.065
Do you not want to talk?

32:39.099 --> 32:40.534
Because you seemed
so happy to see me.

32:40.568 --> 32:42.905
I was. I am.

32:42.939 --> 32:46.273
Good. 'Cause I was
happy to see you.

32:49.779 --> 32:51.247
You know what, Don?

32:51.281 --> 32:54.813
I am put in a strange position.

32:54.848 --> 32:57.181
But I want you to know

32:57.215 --> 32:59.185
I respect you.

33:01.855 --> 33:04.021
Agencies change.

33:04.055 --> 33:06.459
For the better, maybe.

33:06.493 --> 33:09.063
But guys like us, we've got
to look out for each other.

33:09.097 --> 33:11.498
I'm not gonna tell your wife.

33:11.532 --> 33:13.601
That's not what I meant.

33:13.635 --> 33:15.673
You wouldn't do that.

33:15.707 --> 33:17.877
You wouldn't do that.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.749
We go back a long way,
don't we?

33:21.783 --> 33:24.388
We do.

33:24.422 --> 33:26.893
Well, I'm going to make sure

33:26.927 --> 33:29.997
that you're still important.

33:30.031 --> 33:31.766
I don't know how.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.137
It's gonna take some thought.

33:34.172 --> 33:36.408
It's gonna take
some major brain power.

33:36.443 --> 33:38.978
In fact, you might
have to figure it out.

33:39.012 --> 33:43.016
I think the solution here
is not to get rid of you.

33:43.050 --> 33:45.286
You should be in LA.

33:45.321 --> 33:48.390
Your wife's out here.
Ted Chaough is useless.

33:48.424 --> 33:50.526
<i>Use-less.</i>

33:50.561 --> 33:53.897
Ted Chaough.
Broken man.

33:56.066 --> 33:57.531
What solution?

33:57.566 --> 34:00.362
Oh, this is the final solution.

34:00.397 --> 34:03.828
Cutler and Lou
are pursuing Commander.

34:03.862 --> 34:05.894
Commander who?

34:05.928 --> 34:07.563
No, Commander cigarettes.

34:07.598 --> 34:09.233
Philip Morris.

34:09.266 --> 34:11.435
I think they're pretty sure
that they can land it

34:11.469 --> 34:12.969
and you'll have to go.

34:15.368 --> 34:18.237
How long has this been going on?
Is there work?

34:19.871 --> 34:21.772
Don't make me sorry I told you.

34:25.679 --> 34:28.012
I hope you know how much
I appreciate this.

34:30.716 --> 34:33.317
So far, just phone calls.

34:33.351 --> 34:36.083
But I turned in
the media plan yesterday.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.652
Can we get another round?

34:47.260 --> 34:49.161
Hello.

34:49.195 --> 34:51.630
Everybody just left.

34:53.034 --> 34:54.668
Not everybody.

34:54.702 --> 34:56.436
Wilma!

34:56.469 --> 34:58.340
Ah!

35:00.943 --> 35:02.978
How was the night on the
town with Harry Crane?

35:03.013 --> 35:05.317
Educational.

35:05.351 --> 35:08.788
You know what would
make you feel better?

35:08.823 --> 35:11.023
Drugs.

35:14.629 --> 35:16.029
I'm tired.

35:17.164 --> 35:18.832
But you just got here.

35:22.737 --> 35:24.371
I'm going to bed.

35:26.107 --> 35:28.243
There goes the fun.

35:48.224 --> 35:51.425
I'm supposed to tuck you in.

35:51.460 --> 35:53.827
And what does your friend say?

35:58.533 --> 36:00.867
I don't want you
to be in a bad mood.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.569
Stop playing around.
You're stoned.

36:04.604 --> 36:07.071
Don't you like Amy?

36:07.105 --> 36:09.106
Leave him alone.

36:18.414 --> 36:20.980
This is the best place
to be right now, Don.

36:21.014 --> 36:23.349
Right here.

36:24.352 --> 36:27.588
Kiss her.
I know you want to.

36:29.123 --> 36:30.823
I don't want anything
right now.

36:35.966 --> 36:38.001
Don't lie.

38:04.705 --> 38:07.137
- Hey.
- I can't find the coffee.

38:07.172 --> 38:09.573
I'll get it.

38:15.017 --> 38:16.383
Good morning.

38:16.417 --> 38:17.918
Good morning.

38:27.731 --> 38:30.298
Hello.

38:30.332 --> 38:33.869
Oh, yes, hi.
He made it.

38:35.039 --> 38:37.138
It's Stephanie.

38:37.172 --> 38:39.638
Oh.

38:39.673 --> 38:42.110
Where are you?

38:42.144 --> 38:43.612
I'm back in Oakland.

38:43.647 --> 38:45.145
I felt bad about missing you,

38:45.180 --> 38:46.646
but I didn't want
to break my word.

38:46.680 --> 38:49.081
You did. You told me you
were gonna be here.

38:50.986 --> 38:53.724
I know, but I kind of
promised Anna

38:53.759 --> 38:55.293
I'd let you live your life.

38:55.327 --> 38:57.162
That is not what she meant.

38:57.196 --> 39:00.268
Like it or not,
I'm worried about you.

39:04.936 --> 39:07.369
I want you to call me
when the baby comes.

39:07.403 --> 39:09.970
I want to take care
of anything you need.

39:10.004 --> 39:13.372
I'm so grateful. And that
Megan's really solid.

39:13.407 --> 39:16.308
Thank her for me again.

39:17.877 --> 39:19.180
You have my number.

39:22.789 --> 39:25.021
Bye-bye.

39:32.097 --> 39:34.998
- I'm sorry.
- She sounds okay.

39:36.567 --> 39:38.067
I have to get back.

39:39.837 --> 39:42.474
Harry told me some things
I shouldn't have been told.

39:42.508 --> 39:45.139
- What is wrong with him?
- No, I'm glad.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.106
But I have to get back.

39:47.141 --> 39:50.313
Really?

39:50.347 --> 39:52.551
But you're still coming
back next weekend, right?

39:52.586 --> 39:54.118
Of course.

39:54.152 --> 39:56.152
Hello, everyone.

39:56.186 --> 39:57.621
Bye, everyone.

39:57.656 --> 39:59.190
I'm making coffee.

39:59.225 --> 40:01.624
I'm gonna split.

40:01.659 --> 40:03.858
Great party.

40:10.434 --> 40:13.335
I'm gonna shower.

40:28.570 --> 40:30.371
How'd it go?

40:30.405 --> 40:32.706
She doesn't need an operation.

40:32.741 --> 40:34.441
It's not even broken.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.676
Come on.

40:36.711 --> 40:38.912
Let's go inside.

40:38.946 --> 40:41.281
I'm comfortable here right now.

40:42.617 --> 40:45.053
I just drove to White Plains
and back up to Farmington.

40:45.087 --> 40:46.820
I don't want to sit
in the kitchen like the help.

40:46.854 --> 40:48.487
"The help"?

40:48.521 --> 40:50.623
I'm going to assume
you're not referring to me.

40:50.657 --> 40:52.022
What's gotten into you?

40:52.057 --> 40:53.723
You come in and ask me to move

40:53.757 --> 40:55.690
just because you feel
like moving.

40:55.725 --> 40:59.023
I'm comfortable in here or I
wouldn't be sitting in here.

40:59.057 --> 41:02.593
- Knock it off. - I'm tired of
everyone telling me to shut up.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.764
I'm not stupid.

41:04.798 --> 41:06.399
I speak Italian.

41:08.069 --> 41:09.871
I'm sorry I embarrassed you.

41:09.905 --> 41:13.444
You're sorry you forgot to inform
me what I'm supposed to think.

41:13.478 --> 41:16.411
Guess what?
I think all by myself.

41:16.445 --> 41:19.314
You're so smart. Why don't
<i>you</i> run for office?

41:19.348 --> 41:21.285
Know what, Henry? I don't
know what I'm going to do,

41:21.319 --> 41:23.521
but that's a good idea.

41:33.168 --> 41:35.203
Good morning, Michael.

41:35.238 --> 41:36.939
How are you?

41:39.643 --> 41:42.380
Can't you tell?
I'm myself again.

41:42.414 --> 41:45.514
Oh, good.
I'm glad to hear that.

41:45.548 --> 41:48.587
But I do want to say
in the clearness of day,

41:48.621 --> 41:50.124
I have feelings for you.

41:50.158 --> 41:52.427
Well, I'm flattered,

41:52.461 --> 41:56.698
and that happens
when you work with people.

41:56.732 --> 41:59.033
But it's not real.

41:59.068 --> 42:01.366
I realized it was
the waves of data.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.833
They were filling me up.
I had to find the release.

42:03.868 --> 42:05.901
I removed the pressure.

42:05.935 --> 42:08.035
Now it just flows through me
without affecting me at all.

42:08.070 --> 42:09.969
It has an outlet.
Open it.

42:12.274 --> 42:14.841
You don't have to
thank me for that.

42:14.876 --> 42:17.439
It's obviously something
you did on your own.

42:19.509 --> 42:22.811
What is that?

42:22.845 --> 42:25.812
It's my nipple.
It's the valve.

42:27.482 --> 42:29.251
It's weird.
They'll sew it up,

42:29.285 --> 42:32.188
but they won't take it off.
I had to do that myself.

42:33.790 --> 42:36.590
Anyway, I'm grateful,
so I wanted to show it.

42:45.988 --> 42:48.354
Michael, sit down.

42:50.859 --> 42:52.927
I want you to wait here.

43:09.438 --> 43:11.906
Did Mr. Ginsberg
find you?

43:38.234 --> 43:40.634
Jim, Lou.
Sorry to interrupt.

43:42.303 --> 43:44.839
You must be Les.
Don Draper.

43:44.874 --> 43:46.642
Don.

43:46.676 --> 43:49.709
This is Stephen and Tony.

43:49.743 --> 43:51.277
We weren't expecting you, Don.

43:51.311 --> 43:53.680
I know that and I apologize.

43:53.714 --> 43:56.047
I just wanted to say
something that I think

43:56.081 --> 43:58.984
these gentlemen from Philip
Morris are too polite to say.

43:59.018 --> 44:00.820
We know who you are

44:00.854 --> 44:03.756
and we're only talking
about a presentation right now.

44:03.791 --> 44:06.593
But we do have
a problem working

44:06.627 --> 44:09.162
with the man who cut our throat
in "The New York Times."

44:11.367 --> 44:15.006
Well, if you were
to give us a shot,

44:15.040 --> 44:18.207
I'm prepared
to leave the agency.

44:19.945 --> 44:23.281
Don, thanks for saying that
so that we don't have to.

44:24.616 --> 44:26.215
Just know the man
who wrote that letter

44:26.250 --> 44:29.917
was trying to save his
business, not destroy yours.

44:29.951 --> 44:32.652
Like Lou, I have over 10 years

44:32.686 --> 44:34.921
of tobacco experience.

44:34.955 --> 44:36.788
Since my first day
on Lucky Strike,

44:36.823 --> 44:39.024
the government
was building a scaffold

44:39.059 --> 44:40.860
for your whole industry.

44:40.895 --> 44:42.661
And I found a way
to stay that execution

44:42.696 --> 44:46.835
in '60, '62, '64, and '65.

44:50.142 --> 44:53.381
I'm also the only cigarette man
who sat down with the opposition.

44:55.119 --> 44:57.421
They shared
their strategy with me

44:57.455 --> 44:59.792
and I know how to beat it.

44:59.826 --> 45:02.497
That may be true,

45:02.531 --> 45:05.100
but we don't turn on our
friends as easily as you do.

45:07.072 --> 45:09.774
I just keep thinking
what your friends

45:09.809 --> 45:11.908
at American Tobacco would think

45:11.943 --> 45:14.814
if you made me apologize.

45:14.849 --> 45:17.188
Force me into your service.

45:19.289 --> 45:21.759
They are still your
competition, aren't they?

45:25.400 --> 45:27.669
Gentlemen, thank you
for your time.

45:39.985 --> 45:42.386
Get out while you can!

45:45.159 --> 45:47.062
I'm gonna ride down with him.

46:06.560 --> 46:08.661
You're incredible.

46:08.696 --> 46:10.197
Thank you.

46:21.284 --> 46:24.021
You think this is going
to save you, don't you?

46:32.935 --> 46:36.106
