WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:08.424
Okay, she is the star of the play,
and she is my girlfriend.

00:08.591 --> 00:11.301
I get to have sex
with the star of the play.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.221
- People can hear you.
- I know.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.356
- Wow, she looks great, doesn't she?
- Mm.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.152
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.821
That is one good-looking man.

00:32.741 --> 00:37.578
Is it just me, or can you actually
see his abs through his overcoat?

00:38.663 --> 00:41.415
So, you been doing this long?

00:41.583 --> 00:45.919
No. You're my first.
Put the money on the table.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.798
Oh, yeah.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.133
Ooh, that's nice.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.846
Dude.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.853
- Is that an expensive blouse?
- If you want it to be.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.235
Here's your girlfriend's button.

02:02.455 --> 02:06.375
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have, like, your
old blouses and dresses from high school?

02:07.127 --> 02:09.544
Yeah, I think I have some
around here somewhere. Why?

02:09.711 --> 02:11.880
Well, it's just maternity clothes
are so expensive.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.636
Hey, Rach, I made a pile
of your stuff on this side of your room.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.471
- If you could just...
- Ugh!

02:20.557 --> 02:22.516
- Throw your purses at it.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.394
Bloomingdale's eliminated
my department.

02:27.021 --> 02:30.315
- Oh, my God. Are you out of a job?
- No, they stuck me in Personal Shopping...

02:30.483 --> 02:32.693
...which is just a huge step down.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.153
Personal Shopping, what is that?

02:34.320 --> 02:36.572
Like where you walk around
with snooty rich people...

02:36.739 --> 02:38.407
...and tell them what to buy?

02:38.575 --> 02:41.869
- Uh-huh.
- That sounds great.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.538
Hey.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.125
Um, excuse me, we switched apartments.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.044
You can't eat our food anymore.
That gravy train has ended.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.921
There's gravy?

02:54.299 --> 02:57.467
If you have the big apartment, then deal
with people coming over all the time.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.721
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay?
That's your apartment now.

03:04.642 --> 03:08.061
- What are you doing?
- I think I left a doughnut up here.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.734
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.736
Oh, how was Kathy's play?

03:15.904 --> 03:19.031
Well, Kathy gets half-naked
and simulates sex...

03:19.199 --> 03:21.909
...with a real good-looking guy.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.953
Yeah, it was like somebody
wrote down my worst nightmare...

03:25.121 --> 03:28.040
...and then charged me $32 to see it.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.293
That's a good idea for a business.

03:31.461 --> 03:35.464
I'm totally screwed, okay? They're gonna be
hot and heavy on-stage every night...

03:35.632 --> 03:39.468
...and then they're gonna go to their
cast parties, and he's gonna undermine me.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.138
You know, he'll be like, "So where's your
boyfriend? What's his name, Chester?"

03:43.306 --> 03:47.726
And she'll go, "No, no, no. It's Chandler."
He'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha."

03:49.354 --> 03:51.021
That is a good trick.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.651
All right, look, look.
What am I gonna do?

03:55.818 --> 03:58.820
Chandler, look, they're actors.
They're there to do a job.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.615
Just because they work together
doesn't mean they'll get together.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.493
Just because it happened
with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...

04:04.661 --> 04:06.578
...doesn't mean it's gonna happen
with them.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.915
Oh, oh. Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.125
- Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
- Yeah.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.754
Okay, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.298
They're not a couple.

04:19.466 --> 04:21.260
Oh, okay, I get the game now.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.180
Okay, look, look.
Let me ask you a question.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.683
When they were doing it on-stage,
was it like really hot?

04:27.850 --> 04:29.810
Huh. Oh, yeah.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.313
Well, okay, so then you're fine.

04:33.481 --> 04:37.776
Look, the rule is when two actors
are actually doing it off-stage...

04:37.944 --> 04:41.280
...then all the sexual tension
between them is gone.

04:41.447 --> 04:45.701
Okay? So as long as it's hot on-stage,
you got nothing to worry about.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.537
It's when the heat goes away,
that's when you're in trouble.

04:49.956 --> 04:50.998
Really?

04:51.165 --> 04:52.958
You guys have been to every play
I've been in.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.751
Have I ever had chemistry on-stage?

04:54.919 --> 04:56.545
- No.
- No.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.552
So, uh, man, are you gonna go see the play
with me tonight?

05:03.720 --> 05:05.971
You know what? I don't know
how comfortable I am...

05:06.139 --> 05:09.558
...going to see how hot the sex is
between some guy and your girlfriend.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.269
- Yeah, I know...
- No, no, no, oh, I'm there.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.814
- Hey.
- Hey, Mon.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.150
- Want some pancakes?
- You made pancakes?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.110
Yep. Grab a plate.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.780
No, no. Stay right there.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.784
Getting closer.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.620
Don't worry...

05:30.788 --> 05:33.749
...we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles...

05:33.916 --> 05:38.378
...and jams, jellies and marmalades,
which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.674
Also we're watching the game here
Saturday, if people want to come over.

05:42.842 --> 05:43.925
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

05:44.093 --> 05:46.136
I was having people over for the game.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.305
Oh, yeah? Who's playing?

05:50.558 --> 05:52.017
The players.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.938
Somebody seems to be missing
being the hostess.

05:57.273 --> 06:02.444
Ha, ha. Please, it's a relief,
is what it is, is what it is.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.863
All right. Pheebs, stick out your plate.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.114
Oh.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.247
Monica, I'm quitting.

06:14.415 --> 06:18.710
I just helped an 81 -year-old woman put on
a thong, and she didn't even buy it.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.672
I'm telling you, I'm quitting, that's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.926
Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.345
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.474
Oh! Mr. Waltham?
I, uh, really need to talk to you.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.185
In a moment, please.
I'm in the middle of a task.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.686
And you have a customer.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.317
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Joshua.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.779
Hi, I'm Rachel Green.
What can I do for you, Joshua?

06:46.489 --> 06:50.951
Well, I need a new wardrobe. My wife...
Well, my ex-wife...

06:51.119 --> 06:53.495
Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.293
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.

07:00.461 --> 07:05.424
So I got away with two things: This suit
and what turned out to be a, uh, skirt. Heh.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.552
Well, at least that's a great suit.

07:08.719 --> 07:12.347
Yeah, it wasn't much fun dropping it off
at the dry cleaners in the skirt.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.017
So I need everything down to underwear.

07:16.185 --> 07:19.312
So if you're willing, I'm, uh...
I'm all yours.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.815
Okay.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.775
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?

07:23.943 --> 07:25.777
No, no, that wasn't me.

07:27.363 --> 07:31.408
Well, we should get started.
Let me show you my underwear.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.288
The selection of underwear
that we carry.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.879
- Oh, I'm sorry. It's this way.
- It's this way? Sorry.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.380
Oh.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.345
I'm right, right? There was, like,
no chemistry between them.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.639
Before, they had heat.
And now there's no heat.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.060
Now, you know what this means.
Joey told us what this means.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.104
Let's not jump to any conclusions,
all right?

08:01.272 --> 08:04.065
There was some sexual chemistry
between them.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.443
Oh, come on.
It was like cousins having sex up there.

08:09.071 --> 08:13.909
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay?
Just be cool. Don't be, you know, you.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.038
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.790
Oh, thank you so much
for coming again.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.792
- Did you like it tonight?
- Absolutely.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.461
Mm.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.088
Wasn't Nick funny when
he couldn't get his match lit?

08:27.256 --> 08:28.632
Mm!

08:32.094 --> 08:34.596
- It's a good play, isn't it?
- Mm.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.015
I loved the play.
Uh, yeah, you were great.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.977
And, uh, Nick, ditto.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.314
Clearly, you're having sex with him.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.944
Okay.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.534
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?

08:55.701 --> 08:58.495
Oh, come on. It was so obvious.
There was no chemistry between you two.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.414
Okay, let me just get this straight.

09:01.582 --> 09:05.293
You're accusing me of cheating on you,
and you're insulting my performance?

09:05.461 --> 09:07.170
You know,
I can see how this could happen.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.382
You know, you're up there every night,
naked, touching, kissing.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.635
Acting. Chandler, this is my job.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.222
I'm playing a part in a play.
How can you not trust me?

09:17.723 --> 09:20.684
Well, you can understand,
given how we started.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.310
Oh, wow.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.688
I can't believe you're throwing that
in my face.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.983
Well, that is what happened,
and I don't even see you denying this.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.028
I'll tell you what, Chandler.
Why don't you call me when you grow up?

09:32.196 --> 09:35.323
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen
any time soon.

09:40.329 --> 09:43.373
Oh, I have the best job
in the entire world.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.292
The most adorable guy
came over today...

09:45.459 --> 09:48.378
...and I got to dress him up all day.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.256
Rachel has a new doll.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.677
Oh, I wish he was a doll. Then I could get
a Rachel doll and bump them together...

09:55.845 --> 09:57.554
...and make kissing noises.

09:58.347 --> 10:02.767
Oh, and he's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized. Joshua.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.186
Oh, Joshua.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.606
Joshua, Josh.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.232
Uh, hello?

10:09.567 --> 10:10.817
Hi.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.571
Ooh, what do I smell?

10:14.822 --> 10:16.948
I don't know, but it smells good.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.999
- Fresh cookies. Hot from the oven.
- Ooh!

10:26.167 --> 10:28.209
- Please have some.
- Oh, yo.

10:28.377 --> 10:32.088
I've just been fiddling around in here,
making delicious treats for everyone.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.758
Wow. The new Playboy.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.718
Yeah, just something I picked up.

10:36.886 --> 10:40.055
Cookies and porn?
You're the best mom ever.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.103
What? What?

10:47.271 --> 10:52.233
Nothing, it's just something Joshua said
about V-necks, but you had to be there.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.736
How does, uh, Jason look in a V-neck?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.238
- It's Joshua.
- Oh, whatever.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.161
Wait. Wait. This isn't takeout.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.122
- Well, hate to eat and run.
- No, wait, please don't go.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.625
I've got porn for you too.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.543
Yeah, I don't need it.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.214
People are supposed
to want to hang out here.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.257
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?

11:16.425 --> 11:18.677
I'm the hostess.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.846
Not those guys. I'm always the hostess.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.892
I mean, even when I was little, the girls
brought their dollies to my tea party.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.644
I served the best air.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.106
Why did you make a whole big thing...

11:31.273 --> 11:33.650
...out of everyone has to hang out
in the big apartment?

11:33.818 --> 11:36.611
Because they took our apartment.
I wanted to punish them.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.989
But I'm done now.
They've suffered enough.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.577
If you wanted to punish them, you
should have just made them hang out here.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.079
That's true.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.124
All right, this place will be 10 times better
than that place.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.501
Oh, are we gonna trash their place?

11:53.295 --> 11:54.796
Steps.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.550
Slut.

12:02.722 --> 12:07.726
You'll all be very happy to hear
that Kathy is sleeping with that guy.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.561
- What?
- So you were right?

12:09.729 --> 12:13.481
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.484
I don't live here.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.406
- Chandler.
- Chandler, what did she say?

12:21.574 --> 12:22.782
Wait, are you sure?

12:22.950 --> 12:25.702
Well, I may be drunk,
but I know what she said.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.788
So then I went over
to Beefsteak Chewley's...

12:30.875 --> 12:33.084
- Beefsteak Charlie's?
- Yes.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.503
See, you and I have always been like:

12:49.310 --> 12:50.769
Oops.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.522
- Hey, do you need help with that?
- No, I got it.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.693
Oh, I just feel bad. I never vacuum.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.363
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:02.531 --> 13:07.410
So I was with Joshua for an hour today,
and he has not asked me out.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.246
- It's so frustrating.
- Why don't you ask him out?

13:10.414 --> 13:12.832
Oh, yeah. Totally. That's such a turn-on.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.502
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?

13:15.669 --> 13:18.129
Ooh, that's the turn-on.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.509
He just got a divorce, right? So he's
probably really nervous around women.

13:22.676 --> 13:25.094
You know? Maybe you just need
to make the first move.

13:25.262 --> 13:29.015
- I've never asked a guy out before.
- You've never asked a guy out?

13:29.183 --> 13:30.266
No, have you?

13:30.434 --> 13:32.477
Thousands of times. Ha, ha.

13:34.104 --> 13:37.065
That doesn't make me
sound too good, does it?

13:37.233 --> 13:39.567
I don't even know
how I would go about it.

13:39.735 --> 13:43.446
Oh, what I do is, uh, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

13:43.614 --> 13:44.989
"Hey.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.450
How you doing?"

13:49.453 --> 13:51.120
Oh, please.

13:51.288 --> 13:52.413
Hey.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.332
How you doing?

13:58.879 --> 14:00.505
You know what? I'm gonna do that.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.132
I'm gonna call him up
and I'm gonna ask him out.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.886
- Yeah.
- I can do that. Ask him out.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.847
"How you doing?"

14:12.142 --> 14:13.393
Hi, Joshua?

14:13.561 --> 14:16.145
It's Rachel Green, from Bloomingdale's.

14:16.313 --> 14:19.524
Yeah, um, I was just wondering
if you, um...

14:20.359 --> 14:22.277
If you, um...

14:24.405 --> 14:26.948
Left your wallet at the store today?

14:27.783 --> 14:31.077
Oh, well, we found a wallet, and we...

14:31.662 --> 14:35.331
The license? Oh, that is a good idea.

14:35.499 --> 14:39.419
Uh, well, let's see.
This license belongs to a, uh...

14:39.628 --> 14:44.173
Uh, belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.802
And, um, yeah.

14:47.970 --> 14:52.807
So okay. So sorry to bother you at home.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.562
- You've done that a thousand times?
- I've never done that.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.107
Oh, God, I just got so nervous
that he was gonna say no.

15:01.275 --> 15:06.029
Well, you gotta give him something
he can't say no to, like, uh, Knicks tickets.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.823
Invite the guy to a Knicks game.
You're guaranteed he'll say yes.

15:08.991 --> 15:12.076
- Really? You think that will work?
- Absolutely, and if doesn't, can I go?

15:14.872 --> 15:16.539
- What the heck is that?
- What is that?

15:29.887 --> 15:31.054
Did she call?

15:33.223 --> 15:34.265
No. Sorry.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.727
- Well, maybe I should call her.
- No.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.313
Forget her, man. You don't need her.
Don't need that.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.024
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.110
Well, yeah, but you know,
what if I was wrong?

15:46.528 --> 15:47.987
How might you be wrong?

15:48.280 --> 15:50.782
Well, you know, what if she didn't
actually sleep with the guy?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.117
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.

15:53.285 --> 15:56.245
She did not have to tell me.
I saw the play and there was no heat.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.706
- Back me up here, Ross.
- That's all your basing this on?

15:58.874 --> 16:00.792
That's not backing me up.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.127
You said, you know,
with the off-stage and the heat...

16:03.295 --> 16:05.171
...and the on-stage and the heat...
- Whoa, whoa.

16:05.339 --> 16:09.175
That was just a theory.
There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out.

16:09.343 --> 16:13.721
Lone gunman, communism, geometry.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.599
Oh, my God.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.397
"Would you like to go
to a basketball game with..."

16:23.148 --> 16:26.734
"You know, it's funny, basketball,
because I happen to have tickets to..."

16:26.902 --> 16:29.570
No. Okay. Um...

16:31.573 --> 16:33.282
"Who likes the Knicks?"

16:36.412 --> 16:38.579
- What do you think?
- Oh.

16:38.789 --> 16:43.459
Well, as a single woman,
who is available...

16:44.461 --> 16:46.004
...I think you look great.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.673
- Huh. Yeah?
- Yup.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.426
Oh, yeah, you look great.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.891
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this looks great.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.853
Um, so you like it?

17:02.021 --> 17:05.314
I do, I do. I love it.
In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.

17:05.482 --> 17:09.609
- Great.
- Well, thank you so much for all your help.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.489
- Well, I guess, uh... I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

17:13.656 --> 17:14.991
Thanks.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.993
Maybe I'll see you in the spring
with the... For the bathing suits.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.288
You don't want to do that now?

17:21.373 --> 17:22.957
Oh, that's okay.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.084
Anyway,
hopefully I'll see you around sometime.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.127
Basketball.

17:28.630 --> 17:29.672
Sorry?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.132
I, uh...

17:31.633 --> 17:34.761
I have two tickets to the Knicks game
tonight if you're interested...

17:34.928 --> 17:37.430
...just as a thank-you for this week.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.350
Wow. That would be great.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.603
- Really?
- Yeah, That would be fantastic.

17:43.771 --> 17:47.231
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks.

17:48.776 --> 17:52.195
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Rachel.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.197
- Good morning.
- Hi.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.740
Oh.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.290
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.336
I just wanted to come over
to say that I'm sorry.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.380
You know, I acted like the biggest idiot
in the world.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.133
And I can completely understand
why you were so upset.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.177
Oh, wow.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.721
I really wish you'd called me.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.598
Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.

18:20.766 --> 18:24.227
But, you know,
I think this is a good thing. You know?

18:24.394 --> 18:26.938
Because we've had our first fight,
and now we can move on.

18:27.564 --> 18:30.066
You know, I mean, I know for me, but...

18:36.657 --> 18:38.241
Nick's pants?

18:38.575 --> 18:39.951
Yeah.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.078
Yeah. Well.

18:42.454 --> 18:46.249
I think our second fight
is going to be a big one.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.925
- Okay, for next time, what do you say?
- "I have an extra ticket."

18:56.093 --> 18:59.345
"An extra ticket." Not "two tickets."
I have and extra ticket.

19:01.723 --> 19:05.434
So the first time you asked a guy out
he turned you down?

19:07.563 --> 19:10.606
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game, isn't he?

19:10.774 --> 19:12.567
I got the date. I'm just not on it.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.115
Okay, it's ready.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.951
- Come on.
- What's ready?

19:22.327 --> 19:23.786
Just come.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.792
Oh, my God.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.254
- Wow.
- Monica, this is beautiful.

19:33.422 --> 19:37.175
Oh, did you work for two days straight?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.468
Pretty much.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.221
So, what do you think of the floor?

19:42.931 --> 19:44.473
I don't know. Looks the same.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.684
You used to have carpet.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.519
Oh, yeah.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.772
So I made snacks.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.232
Please, just hang out, okay?

19:53.400 --> 19:56.611
I'm just gonna rest my eyes
for just a little bit.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.739
Mon, do you want us to come back later?

19:59.907 --> 20:03.951
Oh, no, no, no. Stay, stay, stay.
Just keep talking.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.121
I'm always the hostess.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.708
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.127
- So?
- Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.172
- Oh, good.
- She is now.

20:18.717 --> 20:23.846
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.723
You think you know a person...

20:25.891 --> 20:28.226
...then they turn around
and they sleep with Nick.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.729
Nick and his rock-hard pecs
and his giant man-nipples.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.693
I hate him. And I hate her.

20:37.861 --> 20:41.697
Well, I don't hate her. I love her.
This is all my fault, really.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.200
- Oh.
- How? How is it your fault?

20:44.368 --> 20:47.245
Because, ugh, I should have called.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.831
You know, if I'd just called her, she never
would have gone out with Nick...

20:50.999 --> 20:53.501
...and they wouldn't have ended up
in bed together.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.878
I threw her at his man-nipples.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.966
Honey, this is not your fault.

21:00.133 --> 21:04.762
Just because you guys had a fight
does not justify her sleeping with someone.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.517
Well, if she thought
they were on a break...

21:16.400 --> 21:21.195
Rachel, one of your customers seems
to have left his billfold. A Joshua Burgen.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.698
- Really?
- Will you call him?

21:23.865 --> 21:26.909
Yes, I will. Absolutely.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.038
Oh.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.591
Hello, Rachel.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.593
Hi, Joshua.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.221
I left my wallet here on purpose.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.639
Really?

21:48.807 --> 21:51.142
Yes, I just wanted to see you again.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.394
Oh, I'm glad.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.772
Rachel, I'd like to say something to you.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.399
Yes?

21:59.234 --> 22:01.068
How you doing?
