00:15.171 --> 00:17.089
And a personalized 5,000-word essay

00:17.173 --> 00:19.474
Of why you're all so awesome.

00:19.542 --> 00:21.176
What's galentine's day?

00:21.244 --> 00:23.311
Oh, it's only the best day of the year.

00:23.379 --> 00:24.913
Every February 13th,

00:24.981 --> 00:26.314
My lady friends and I

00:26.382 --> 00:27.983
Leave our husbands and
our boyfriends at home,

00:28.050 --> 00:30.385
And we just come and kick it,
breakfast-style.

00:30.453 --> 00:32.436
Ladies celebrating ladies.

00:32.522 --> 00:33.905
It's like lilith fair,

00:33.990 --> 00:35.757
Minus the angst.

00:35.825 --> 00:37.892
Plus frittatas.

00:37.944 --> 00:40.495
So to conclude our
galentine's day breakfast,

00:40.563 --> 00:43.665
It is time for the greatest story ever told.

00:45.568 --> 00:46.668
What's the story?

00:46.736 --> 00:48.537
It's the most romantic story ever.

00:48.588 --> 00:52.240
<i>It makes the notebook
look like saw v.</i>

00:52.291 --> 00:54.009
Go, mom, go.

00:54.076 --> 00:55.510
It was 1968.

00:55.578 --> 00:59.131
I was 18, and our family went
on a vacation to bermuda.

00:59.215 --> 01:01.850
And on the first day, I went for a swim

01:01.917 --> 01:05.887
In the ocean, and I got caught

01:05.938 --> 01:07.922
In a very strong current.

01:09.192 --> 01:10.592
You've heard this story before, right?

01:10.643 --> 01:11.977
Yes, but the drama.

01:12.061 --> 01:17.766
The next thing I felt were
two very powerful arms

01:17.817 --> 01:20.152
Whisking me to safety.

01:20.236 --> 01:22.287
And he looked down at me, and he said,

01:22.371 --> 01:25.824
"are you okay?"

01:25.908 --> 01:28.293
And I looked up at him, and I said,

01:28.377 --> 01:31.163
"I am now."

01:31.247 --> 01:32.631
So they sneak out to meet each other

01:32.715 --> 01:33.948
And walk on the beach,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.218
And, two weeks later,
he asked her to marry him

01:36.285 --> 01:37.803
And move to illinois.

01:37.887 --> 01:39.721
But her parents thought she was too young,

01:39.789 --> 01:40.789
So she said no.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.190
And then they lost touch,

01:42.258 --> 01:43.809
And, a few years later, she met my dad.

01:43.893 --> 01:46.061
I got to take one of
those lifeguard courses.

01:46.128 --> 01:47.429
Those guys get all the action.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.480
Am I right, justin?

01:48.564 --> 01:49.798
- We got to find this guy.
- Frank?

01:49.866 --> 01:51.683
He's probably married. Or dead.

01:51.768 --> 01:53.068
what's the difference?

01:53.135 --> 01:54.152
Am I right, justin?

01:54.237 --> 01:55.570
At least let me try and find him.

01:55.638 --> 01:57.989
Imagine how much better that story would be

01:58.074 --> 02:01.526
If we actually reunited them.

02:01.611 --> 02:03.495
I think justin's right.
You should let him do this.

02:03.579 --> 02:05.580
Okay. Do it.

02:05.648 --> 02:07.032
But if you find him and he's weird,

02:07.116 --> 02:09.201
Like a ventriloquist or a puppeteer

02:09.285 --> 02:12.087
Or anyone who pretends toys are people,

02:12.154 --> 02:13.188
Then abort the mission.

02:13.256 --> 02:17.259
Absolutely. -

02:20.096 --> 02:28.136
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:37.413 --> 02:39.848
You. You're the best girlfriend ever.

02:39.899 --> 02:42.951
Oh. Happy valentine's day.

02:43.018 --> 02:45.120
I knew, eventually, somehow,

02:45.187 --> 02:47.289
Being in a relationship with
you would totally pay off.

02:47.356 --> 02:49.708
I bought him some actual towels.

02:49.792 --> 02:51.526
He was using a bathrobe.

02:51.577 --> 02:54.496
And I bought him some other
things that humans usually use,

02:54.547 --> 02:55.714
Like shampoo.

02:55.798 --> 02:56.965
Troops, gather around.

02:57.032 --> 02:58.633
Great news.

02:58.701 --> 03:00.752
The senior center valentine's
dance is tomorrow

03:00.837 --> 03:01.870
From 5:00 to 9:00.

03:01.921 --> 03:03.755
Are we talking a.M. Or p.M.?

03:03.840 --> 03:07.142
Those people are old! Am I right, justin?

03:07.209 --> 03:09.043
Oh. Justin's not here.

03:09.095 --> 03:10.562
It isn't just a job, gang.

03:10.646 --> 03:12.213
We're gonna learn a lot from these seniors.

03:12.265 --> 03:16.568
Some of them have been
married for half a century.

03:16.652 --> 03:19.421
And, no offense, but everybody
here is terrible at love.

03:19.488 --> 03:23.859
Divorced, dating a gay guy, divorced twice,

03:23.910 --> 03:25.110
Jury's still out on you two.

03:25.194 --> 03:26.494
Oh.

03:26.562 --> 03:28.113
And, jerry, who knows?

03:28.197 --> 03:29.898
I've been happily married for 28 years.

03:29.949 --> 03:31.499
You've met my wife gayle many times.

03:31.567 --> 03:34.953
Whatever. Finally, ann and mark
are our special volunteers,

03:35.037 --> 03:37.439
And they will be available whenever needed.

03:37.506 --> 03:38.957
I didn't volunteer.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.592
Yeah, too bad. You got drafted.

03:40.676 --> 03:42.711
ask not what

03:42.762 --> 03:44.796
Your old people could do for you.

03:44.881 --> 03:46.965
Ask what you could do for your old people.

03:47.049 --> 03:48.183
Terminator.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.968
What? No. Jfk.

03:50.052 --> 03:51.269
this meeting

03:51.354 --> 03:52.938
Has been terminated.

03:53.022 --> 03:54.806
that is the terminator.

03:54.891 --> 03:57.592
- Nice.
- Where am I going?

04:00.313 --> 04:01.930
- Well, hello there.
- Well, hey.

04:01.981 --> 04:03.431
I got your message.

04:03.482 --> 04:04.983
You wanted to talk?

04:05.067 --> 04:06.284
- Yes, I do.
- Oh.

04:06.369 --> 04:08.102
have a seat.

04:08.154 --> 04:10.322
¶ ¶

04:10.406 --> 04:12.040
Some champagne?

04:12.107 --> 04:13.325
Uh, no, thanks.

04:13.409 --> 04:15.877
Come on. This is armand de brignac.

04:15.945 --> 04:17.829
Jay-z drinks this.
Yeah, well, jay-z doesn't have

04:17.914 --> 04:19.297
To perform surgery in an hour.

04:19.382 --> 04:20.415
- You don't know jay
-z's schedule.

04:20.466 --> 04:21.649
He's a renaissance man.

04:23.085 --> 04:24.002
Okay, fine.

04:24.086 --> 04:25.620
Well, this is for you.

04:25.671 --> 04:26.972
Oh.

04:27.056 --> 04:28.289
Well, it's almost valentine's day,

04:28.341 --> 04:31.660
So I thought it would be
a good day to tell you...

04:31.727 --> 04:35.563
Okay, let me just stop you right there.

04:35.631 --> 04:40.986
Look, tommy...

04:41.070 --> 04:44.155
I-I just want you to know I'm so grateful

04:44.240 --> 04:46.574
For everything you did for me.

04:46.642 --> 04:48.994
But I only see us as friends.

04:49.078 --> 04:50.478
For now.

04:50.529 --> 04:53.081
But think about how much
better our friendship would be

04:53.148 --> 04:55.417
If we added doing it.

04:55.484 --> 04:57.652
Seriously.

04:57.703 --> 04:58.987
I know our marriage was fake,

04:59.038 --> 05:00.922
But there's something between us,

05:00.990 --> 05:03.925
And I think we should
give it a shot for real.

05:03.993 --> 05:06.828
I just don't feel that way about you.

05:08.330 --> 05:10.665
I'm sorry.

05:19.976 --> 05:22.027
¶ each time I do ¶

05:22.111 --> 05:23.845
¶ just the thought of you ¶

05:23.896 --> 05:26.398
¶ makes me stop before I begin ¶

05:26.482 --> 05:27.682
¶ ¶

05:27.733 --> 05:30.652
¶ I got you ¶

05:30.703 --> 05:32.904
¶ under my skin ¶

05:32.989 --> 05:34.522
So there's that one, I guess.

05:34.573 --> 05:36.624
All right. You guys sound
ready for the dance tomorrow.

05:36.692 --> 05:38.793
I don't know about these
old fogey songs, leslie.

05:38.861 --> 05:40.662
Why can't we just do our originals?

05:40.713 --> 05:42.547
I just wrote a new song, okay.

05:42.631 --> 05:45.000
<i>Bottom line: It's called sex hair.</i>

05:45.051 --> 05:46.885
It's about how you can tell
when someone's just had sex

05:46.969 --> 05:48.837
'cause of how their hair
gets matted up in the back.

05:48.888 --> 05:50.605
It's awesome.

05:50.673 --> 05:52.140
Think of it this way.

05:52.207 --> 05:55.543
These song are exactly like
the songs you usually play,

05:55.594 --> 05:59.547
Except instead of modern rock,
they're old jazzy standards

05:59.598 --> 06:02.384
From the '40s.

06:02.451 --> 06:04.436
Okay. Yeah. You got a point.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.071
Yeah. You're gonna do great.

06:06.155 --> 06:08.990
- All right, guys.
- Hey, andy.

06:09.058 --> 06:11.076
I've been here for a half an hour.
Can I get my shoeshine?

06:11.160 --> 06:12.894
Dude, kyle, I'm gonna lose my on you

06:12.945 --> 06:15.463
If you ask me one more time.

06:15.531 --> 06:18.500
I found him.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.952
Frank beckerson.

06:21.037 --> 06:23.838
63, lives in a little
town called bridgeport.

06:23.906 --> 06:25.340
Illinois.

06:25.407 --> 06:29.377
Divorced, no kids, worked as
a lifeguard when he was 20.

06:31.013 --> 06:32.680
Ron, I need a half a day off

06:32.748 --> 06:34.466
For a secret mission of love.

06:34.550 --> 06:37.469
You're asking my permission
to take a nooner?

06:37.553 --> 06:38.970
Sure. Well, I don't know.

06:39.055 --> 06:40.772
Maybe. Justin and I need to go

06:40.856 --> 06:42.273
On a romantically inspired road trip.

06:42.358 --> 06:43.441
So it is a nooner.

06:43.526 --> 06:44.692
Well, we're planning

06:44.760 --> 06:46.861
To leave around noon,
so I'm not quite sure--

06:46.929 --> 06:48.196
Leslie, it's not a nooner.

06:48.263 --> 06:50.264
I tracked down this old
flame of leslie's mom.

06:50.316 --> 06:51.649
We're gonna go pick him up.

06:51.734 --> 06:54.135
We're gonna reunite them on valentine's day.

06:54.203 --> 06:55.770
A great story or what?

06:55.821 --> 06:57.772
Yeah, great story indeed.

06:57.823 --> 07:00.208
Enjoy your half day off. - Thank you.

07:00.275 --> 07:01.626
Pick you up tomorrow around noon.

07:01.710 --> 07:03.945
For our nooner, which is a cute word.

07:03.996 --> 07:05.463
Explain it to her later.

07:05.548 --> 07:06.948
Explain what?

07:06.999 --> 07:09.617
Happy valentine's day.

07:09.668 --> 07:14.339
First off, a bear in a paper
bag and a heart-shaped balloon.

07:14.423 --> 07:16.841
I love bears and bags.

07:16.926 --> 07:18.459
Well, you'll like this then,

07:18.511 --> 07:21.312
Because this is a giant teddy bear

07:21.397 --> 07:22.797
Holding a red heart.

07:22.848 --> 07:24.799
- Ohh.
- Festive.

07:24.850 --> 07:26.067
What's this? Oh, I don't know.

07:26.135 --> 07:27.986
It's a heart-shaped box of chocolates.

07:28.070 --> 07:31.189
That's a dozen red roses in a hear
t-shaped arrangement.

07:31.273 --> 07:33.307
See that. Perfume.

07:33.359 --> 07:34.976
- Ooh.
- For the lady.

07:35.027 --> 07:35.994
- Ooh.
- Oh, yeah.

07:36.078 --> 07:37.145
i>- Yearning,

07:37.196 --> 07:39.080
By dennis feinstein.

07:39.148 --> 07:40.915
Mm. Ooh.

07:40.983 --> 07:43.317
Dennis, no. No, dennis.

07:43.369 --> 07:45.703
Finally, the heart of the ocean.

07:45.788 --> 07:48.506
gorgeous.

07:48.591 --> 07:50.675
Oh.

07:50.759 --> 07:52.427
You know, I never had a chance to get a girl

07:52.494 --> 07:55.180
A cliched valentine's day gift before,

07:55.264 --> 07:57.665
So I got you all of 'em.

08:00.136 --> 08:01.836
Thank you. That was very sweet.

08:01.887 --> 08:03.688
Do you think they'll get married?

08:03.772 --> 08:05.173
Oh, my god. What if they get married?

08:05.224 --> 08:06.507
That would be amazing.

08:06.559 --> 08:08.843
would I call him dad then?

08:08.894 --> 08:10.678
- Yeah.
- No, that'd be too much.

08:10.729 --> 08:13.481
Maybe I'll call him pappy. Pop.

08:13.532 --> 08:15.533
Poppy. Papa.

08:15.618 --> 08:17.202
Oh, look at me, I'm getting ahead of myself.

08:17.286 --> 08:18.903
Hey, you never know.

08:18.988 --> 08:22.740
- I'm gonna call him poo
-paw.

08:22.825 --> 08:25.460
How often do you get to reunite soul mates?

08:25.527 --> 08:28.163
What if I told you that you
could reunite romeo and juliet?

08:28.214 --> 08:32.467
Or brad pitt and jennifer aniston?

08:32.534 --> 08:36.871
Oh, jen, I really want you to be happy.

08:36.922 --> 08:38.890
Stay away from john mayer.

08:40.176 --> 08:42.059
I cannot believe I'm gonna
meet frank beckerson.

08:42.144 --> 08:44.729
I feel like I've known him my whole life.

08:44.813 --> 08:47.381
Frank?

08:47.433 --> 08:49.734
My god!

08:49.818 --> 08:52.570
Marlene. - Oh, no, poo-paw. Poo-paw, no.

08:52.655 --> 08:53.888
I'm not marlene.

08:53.939 --> 08:56.608
Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:56.692 --> 08:58.226
I should really wear my glasses.

08:58.277 --> 09:00.895
Come on in.

09:04.041 --> 09:05.441
Frank, I was wondering,

09:05.493 --> 09:07.777
My mom always said that
you wanted to be a lawyer.

09:07.829 --> 09:08.778
Did that work out?

09:08.830 --> 09:10.831
No. Never did.

09:10.915 --> 09:13.950
Though I did once act as my own lawyer.

09:14.001 --> 09:15.302
Oh, you know what,

09:15.386 --> 09:17.888
I found some old pictures of marlene and me.

09:17.955 --> 09:20.674
Look. -

09:20.758 --> 09:22.475
Look how young she is.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.227
These are amazing.

09:24.295 --> 09:26.980
Probably shouldn't show you this one.

09:27.064 --> 09:28.348
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la.

09:28.432 --> 09:30.183
No, thank you.

09:30.268 --> 09:32.235
You mom was such a firecracker.

09:32.303 --> 09:34.654
Smart, funny, sharp as a tack.

09:34.739 --> 09:37.157
Such firm breasts.

09:37.241 --> 09:38.992
Oh, that was inappropriate.

09:39.076 --> 09:42.913
Oh, wow, I'm just, all of a sudden,

09:42.980 --> 09:46.316
So nervous to see her again.

09:46.367 --> 09:48.201
I'm gonna throw up real quick,

09:48.286 --> 09:50.754
And then we can leave.

09:50.821 --> 09:52.923
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.708
Valentine's bash at the bulge tonight.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.193
We can get you a drink bracelet.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.894
I can't. I've got to work

09:57.962 --> 10:00.663
At this senior center
valentine's day dance thing.

10:00.715 --> 10:02.866
That sounds amazing. Can we come?

10:02.934 --> 10:05.051
I guess. I don't know why you would want to.

10:05.136 --> 10:06.803
Because old people are funny.

10:06.854 --> 10:08.188
i>- Yeah. It'll be like
the golden girls.

10:08.272 --> 10:12.842
I have to go get ready.

10:12.894 --> 10:15.028
So, frank, where have you
been for the past 40 years?

10:15.112 --> 10:17.063
Oh, you know, here and there.

10:17.148 --> 10:19.282
You know, grenada for a while.

10:19.350 --> 10:22.869
Then panama. Then afghanistan.

10:22.954 --> 10:24.037
So you were in the military?

10:24.121 --> 10:25.372
Nope.

10:25.456 --> 10:27.857
You know, I always wonder how different

10:27.909 --> 10:30.710
My life would have been if
your mother had married me.

10:30.795 --> 10:32.329
It would have been better.

10:32.380 --> 10:33.696
I'll tell you that much.

10:35.499 --> 10:37.717
Frank? Frank, are you okay?

10:37.802 --> 10:40.420
I'm fine. I'm good.

10:40.504 --> 10:43.873
Oh, I am just so nervous

10:43.925 --> 10:45.008
To see her.

10:45.059 --> 10:46.709
There is nothing to be nervous about.

10:46.761 --> 10:48.878
Oh, have you got a bag or something?

10:48.930 --> 10:51.014
- Do you have a bag?
- I have a purse.

10:51.065 --> 10:52.048
Well, give him your purse.

10:52.099 --> 10:55.602
All right.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.723
- ¶ you like pot
-ay-to ¶

11:00.775 --> 11:02.575
¶ and I like pot-ah-to ¶

11:02.660 --> 11:04.394
¶ you like tom-ay-to ¶

11:04.445 --> 11:05.862
¶ and I like tom-ah-to ¶

11:05.913 --> 11:07.530
¶ pot-ay-to, pot-ah-to ¶

11:07.581 --> 11:10.200
¶ tom-ay-to, tom-ah-to ¶

11:10.251 --> 11:14.704
¶ let's call the whole thing off ¶

11:14.755 --> 11:16.873
Uh, I mean, that sucked, didn't it?

11:16.924 --> 11:19.960
Maybe if you sang it like louis armstrong?

11:20.044 --> 11:21.511
Maybe. Yeah.

11:21.578 --> 11:23.430
I mean, here's the thing, though.

11:23.514 --> 11:26.633
Who is that?

11:26.717 --> 11:29.752
My problem is I don't know

11:29.804 --> 11:31.521
How to tell if we're doing good

11:31.588 --> 11:32.922
Because, when you play a rock show,

11:32.974 --> 11:34.557
It's really easy to know
if you're doing great

11:34.608 --> 11:37.394
Because chicks will flash their boobs at you

11:37.445 --> 11:38.862
When you're up on stage.

11:38.929 --> 11:41.898
You're like, oh, that must
have sounded pretty good.

11:41.949 --> 11:43.450
But I can't-- if that happens here,

11:43.534 --> 11:47.671
My eyes will fall out of my head,
and I'll die.

11:51.709 --> 11:54.377
Frank? Frank, are you okay?

11:58.466 --> 11:59.799
- Maybe we should--
- yeah.

11:59.884 --> 12:01.951
- Frank!
- Frank!

12:02.003 --> 12:04.804
- Frank!
- Frank!

12:04.889 --> 12:09.642
¶ I can't see anybody but you ¶

12:09.727 --> 12:11.094
¶ zip flop ¶

12:11.145 --> 12:12.128
You know, I might be crazy,

12:12.179 --> 12:13.930
But I have this weird suspicion

12:13.981 --> 12:16.316
That things are going well with us.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.319
You know, I have that same suspicion.

12:19.403 --> 12:22.655
But, you know,
having never been in something

12:22.740 --> 12:24.991
Like this before, I feel the need to ask,

12:25.076 --> 12:27.143
How am I doing?

12:27.194 --> 12:28.778
Oh, come on.

12:28.829 --> 12:33.149
No, I'm sort of serious.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.984
All right, fine. Forget it.

12:36.987 --> 12:38.038
I'm just saying, you know,

12:38.122 --> 12:40.040
It seems to me on paper

12:40.124 --> 12:41.341
That this thing we have is pretty great.

12:41.425 --> 12:43.843
Yes, nerd, on paper,

12:43.928 --> 12:46.012
This thing we have is pretty great.

12:46.097 --> 12:47.547
Mark is a great boyfriend.

12:47.631 --> 12:49.632
I have no complaints at all.

12:49.683 --> 12:53.836
Everything is good.

12:56.524 --> 12:59.059
I don't know. I don't feel right about this.

12:59.143 --> 13:02.278
Are you kidding me? This is so much fun.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.447
Look, we took a road trip today.

13:04.515 --> 13:07.233
We chased your mom's lon
g-lost love down a freeway.

13:07.318 --> 13:08.851
He's a loon, justin.

13:08.903 --> 13:09.869
So he freaked out a little bit.

13:09.954 --> 13:11.287
He got nervous. I mean, you would too.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.872
And he was fine by the time we
got him back inside the car.

13:12.957 --> 13:14.324
Yeah, well, he cried himself to sleep.

13:14.375 --> 13:16.493
I mean, I don't know why you're pushing.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.244
Why do you want him to
spend time with my mom?

13:18.329 --> 13:19.746
How would that help her?

13:19.830 --> 13:21.798
I don't like this.
I don't think this is gonna work.

13:21.865 --> 13:23.666
I'm calling this off. - Come on. No, no, no.

13:23.717 --> 13:25.568
Look, we're here. Just see what happens.

13:25.636 --> 13:27.420
What happens is I drive him home.

13:27.505 --> 13:28.471
Now, look, you need to breathe.

13:28.539 --> 13:32.208
I'm breathing, okay--

13:36.263 --> 13:40.233
Mom. - Oh, there you are.

13:40.317 --> 13:42.485
So what's the big surprise?

13:42.553 --> 13:44.571
You gonna try to check me
into an old folks' home?

13:44.655 --> 13:46.189
It's a long story.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.274
One that we'd love to tell
you over a cup of coffee

13:48.359 --> 13:49.776
Somewhere far from this place.

13:55.065 --> 13:56.116
Frank.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.701
Hello, marlene.

13:58.752 --> 13:59.786
My god.

13:59.870 --> 14:03.139
I can't believe it's really you.

14:03.207 --> 14:06.676
Want to catch up?

14:06.743 --> 14:09.912
Sure.

14:09.964 --> 14:13.683
¶ we're less than perfect ¶

14:13.750 --> 14:14.934
Oh, boy.

14:15.019 --> 14:16.636
Oh, boy.

14:19.144 --> 14:20.862
Do you think we should stand by--

14:20.929 --> 14:21.863
Shh. Shh. Shh.

14:21.930 --> 14:23.531
She's fine.

14:23.598 --> 14:27.301
Let's just let this unfold.

14:27.369 --> 14:29.504
come here, sonny.

14:29.571 --> 14:31.656
Let me tell you about the civil war.

14:31.740 --> 14:34.142
Grandpa, leave me alone.
You smell like death.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.247
¶ your funny face ¶

14:39.314 --> 14:41.966
I'm gonna get some punch.

14:42.050 --> 14:45.052
¶ we're less than perfect ¶

14:45.120 --> 14:48.456
Excuse me. You guys are really adorable.

14:48.507 --> 14:51.142
That's really nice.

14:51.226 --> 14:52.960
So leslie's like, "that's it.

14:53.011 --> 14:54.628
I'm taking him home."

14:54.680 --> 14:57.181
So we look over, and he's
not even in the car anymore.

14:57.266 --> 15:00.485
- You're kidding.
- No. It's insane.

15:00.569 --> 15:03.187
What does leslie think about all this?

15:03.272 --> 15:05.440
Oh, god, leslie, I don't even know.

15:05.491 --> 15:07.108
I think I just lost track
of her in all the chaos.

15:07.159 --> 15:09.610
Anyway, so now he and
marlene are off somewhere,

15:09.661 --> 15:10.661
Doing god knows what.

15:10.746 --> 15:13.314
I don't want to know.

15:13.365 --> 15:18.753
¶ ooh ¶

15:18.820 --> 15:20.588
You're suing me for alimony?

15:20.655 --> 15:22.790
Yes.

15:22.841 --> 15:24.709
When we were married, I got accustomed

15:24.793 --> 15:26.827
To a certain lifestyle, and I'm entitled

15:26.879 --> 15:28.379
To money to maintain that lifestyle.

15:28.464 --> 15:30.047
This is insane.

15:30.132 --> 15:31.849
Yeah, it's insane, but it's all I got.

15:31.934 --> 15:33.667
And you could make it all go away

15:33.719 --> 15:35.503
If you just gave me a chance.

15:35.554 --> 15:37.388
- What?
- Three dates.

15:39.358 --> 15:42.109
One date.

15:42.177 --> 15:43.110
Coffee?

15:43.178 --> 15:46.280
So your plan was to sue me

15:46.348 --> 15:48.015
And then to use that to blackmail me

15:48.066 --> 15:49.367
Into falling in love with you?

15:49.451 --> 15:52.537
Yeah.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.694
Hey, you guys sound good.

16:00.746 --> 16:03.214
You really think so?

16:03.298 --> 16:05.716
I-- it's impossible to tell.

16:05.801 --> 16:07.368
It's like bizarro land out there.

16:07.419 --> 16:09.670
As soon as we finish a song,
it's dead silence.

16:09.721 --> 16:10.972
Well, what do you expect, you know?

16:11.039 --> 16:12.840
They're like a million years old.

16:12.891 --> 16:15.059
Well, I'm glad you like it.

16:15.143 --> 16:16.394
You were always a big supporter of the band.

16:16.478 --> 16:18.229
Hey, break's over.

16:18.313 --> 16:20.765
Ludgate, cracking the whip.

16:20.849 --> 16:24.151
Yeah, well, these old bags
paid for some entertainment,

16:24.219 --> 16:25.853
So get...

16:25.904 --> 16:27.221
- No, you're right.
- Up there.

16:27.272 --> 16:28.606
Hey, you should play that song,

16:28.690 --> 16:29.740
<i>The way you look tonight.</i>

16:29.825 --> 16:31.225
- Mm.
- That's a good one.

16:31.276 --> 16:34.245
Next one's going out to
a special little lady

16:34.329 --> 16:36.831
Named April ludgate.

16:36.898 --> 16:39.433
¶ ¶

16:39.501 --> 16:43.120
¶ some day ¶

16:43.205 --> 16:47.074
¶ when I'm all alone ¶

16:47.125 --> 16:49.126
Are you guys--

16:49.211 --> 16:51.796
Never mind.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.049
- Why do you care?
- I don't.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.884
¶ of you ¶

16:56.935 --> 17:00.638
¶ and the way you look ¶

17:00.722 --> 17:02.089
Now what about you?

17:02.140 --> 17:03.257
What do you do for a living?

17:03.308 --> 17:07.094
Well, it's been an interesting ride.

17:07.145 --> 17:09.762
- Yeah.
- Got a job at a grocery store

17:09.815 --> 17:11.232
Right out of college.

17:11.282 --> 17:13.067
Just for a way to make money.

17:13.117 --> 17:16.487
Here I am, 40 years later,

17:16.571 --> 17:18.204
Completely unemployed.

17:20.291 --> 17:22.960
Wow.

17:23.045 --> 17:27.665
What do you say we pick
up where we left off?

17:27.749 --> 17:29.783
You're not serious, right?

17:29.835 --> 17:31.752
Serious as a heart attack.

17:31.803 --> 17:34.805
Of which I've had four.

17:34.890 --> 17:39.260
¶ and the world is cold ¶

17:39.311 --> 17:41.896
¶ I will feel a glow ¶

17:41.963 --> 17:46.651
¶ just thinking of you ¶

17:46.735 --> 17:49.403
¶ and the way you look ¶

17:49.471 --> 17:52.273
¶ tonight ¶

17:52.324 --> 17:55.326
¶ ¶

17:55.410 --> 17:57.161
Hey, mom,

17:57.245 --> 17:58.496
Are you okay?

17:58.580 --> 18:00.114
Did frank leave? - Uh, yeah,
he just stepped away

18:00.165 --> 18:01.198
For a second.

18:01.283 --> 18:02.700
I'm so sorry we brought him here.

18:02.784 --> 18:03.918
Oh, it's okay.

18:03.985 --> 18:05.703
It was very thoughtful, sweetheart.

18:05.787 --> 18:07.788
It's not your fault that
he turned out to be--

18:07.839 --> 18:09.173
Excuse me.

18:09.257 --> 18:11.492
Hi. Excuse me, hi.

18:12.794 --> 18:14.629
My name is frank beckerson.

18:14.680 --> 18:20.167
Marlene, you...

18:20.218 --> 18:21.218
Blew it.

18:21.303 --> 18:25.139
Take one last look, marlene,

18:25.190 --> 18:30.311
Because you'll never see this body again.

18:30.362 --> 18:33.180
Marlene, what happened between you two?

18:33.231 --> 18:35.149
Tell me everything. I want every detail.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.018
Hey, we're almost done,
so we can leave soon.

18:38.070 --> 18:39.870
yes, I'll take you

18:39.955 --> 18:43.157
For an ice cream malt,
and then we can go choose our caskets.

18:43.225 --> 18:45.693
God, why does everything
we do have to be cloaked

18:45.744 --> 18:47.161
In, like, 15 layers of irony?

18:47.212 --> 18:49.964
Here's something unironic.

18:50.031 --> 18:51.582
Ever since you've been hanging
out with that meathead,

18:51.667 --> 18:54.301
You've become completely lame.

18:54.369 --> 18:55.753
You know what, we're breaking up.

18:55.837 --> 18:57.871
Fine.

18:57.923 --> 18:59.557
Then you can't make out with
me when you're drunk anymore.

18:59.641 --> 19:01.509
Fine. Then I'll make out with ben.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.877
- Pass.
- No, he's my boyfriend.

19:03.929 --> 19:05.730
You can either make out with
both of us or none of us.

19:05.814 --> 19:07.381
Fine. None of you.

19:07.432 --> 19:11.402
Fine.

19:11.486 --> 19:14.822
¶ I've got you ¶

19:14.889 --> 19:19.944
¶ under my skin ¶

19:21.830 --> 19:24.248
Everything okay, knope?

19:24.332 --> 19:26.367
My boyfriend is a lawyer,

19:26.418 --> 19:28.836
And he's smart and interesting,

19:28.903 --> 19:31.422
And there's a lot of
things about him I like.

19:31.506 --> 19:34.408
But he acted like a real jerk today.

19:34.459 --> 19:36.594
I don't know. There's
something about the way

19:36.678 --> 19:38.963
He treats people or something.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.081
He's a tourist.

19:41.133 --> 19:43.384
He vacations in people's lives,

19:43.435 --> 19:45.136
Takes pictures,

19:45.220 --> 19:47.938
Puts 'em in a scrapbook, and moves on.

19:48.023 --> 19:50.274
All he's interested in are stories.

19:50.358 --> 19:52.977
Huh.

19:53.061 --> 19:56.930
Basically, leslie, he's selfish.

19:56.982 --> 19:58.115
And you're not.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.152
And that's why you don't like him.

20:01.236 --> 20:03.937
I told you so.

20:03.989 --> 20:05.105
It's duke silver.

20:05.157 --> 20:07.942
Duke, can I have your autograph?

20:08.009 --> 20:09.493
I love your music.

20:09.578 --> 20:11.912
You're mistaken, ladies.

20:11.963 --> 20:14.548
Move along.

20:14.616 --> 20:18.969
¶ under my skin ¶

20:19.054 --> 20:20.287
Whoo!

20:20.338 --> 20:21.972
Yeah, go mouse rat!

20:22.057 --> 20:24.008
Whoo!

20:24.092 --> 20:27.344
I thought you were just terrific.

20:27.429 --> 20:28.646
Seriously?

20:28.730 --> 20:30.347
You sound like dean martin.

20:30.432 --> 20:35.152
If I were 50 years younger... - Ew.

20:36.772 --> 20:38.639
Wait, who's dean martin?

20:38.690 --> 20:40.107
If I'm not mistaken, that was

20:40.158 --> 20:42.276
The old lady version of flashing.

20:42.327 --> 20:44.028
Nailed the gig.

20:45.536 --> 20:46.753
Look, it's sad. I know.

20:46.820 --> 20:48.488
But we'll still be friends.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.990
We're gonna see each other all the time.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.542
I come into town, like, every other weekend.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.827
No. You guys can't break up.

20:54.878 --> 20:55.695
We can fix this. Let me talk to leslie.

20:55.746 --> 20:56.862
Tom, it's over.

20:56.914 --> 20:58.414
She doesn't want to see me anymore.

20:58.499 --> 21:00.233
Is it my fault? Did I do something wrong?

21:00.301 --> 21:03.503
No. Seriously, this has
nothing to do with you.

21:03.554 --> 21:06.472
- Can we still go suit shopping?
- Of course.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.424
Armani's having a sale right now.

21:08.509 --> 21:11.094
Time to get you a pocket square.

21:11.178 --> 21:13.045
All right.

21:13.097 --> 21:16.417
