METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THE COMPONENT PARTS

03:39.802 --> 03:42.069
ARE MADE OF CYBERTRONIAN ALLOYS.

03:42.169 --> 03:45.870
- SO, MEGATRON'S BEHIND THIS.

03:45.970 --> 03:47.704
- CLONING LONG-EXTINCT RAPTORS

03:47.804 --> 03:50.504
AND FUSING THEM WITH TRANSMETAL TECHNOLOGY.

03:50.604 --> 03:52.304
THERE'S POSSIBLY OTHERS.

03:52.405 --> 03:54.605
- WHICH MEANS...

03:54.705 --> 03:58.572
WE COULD HAVE TROUBLE.

04:01.105 --> 04:02.173

- HEY, WHOA.

04:23.176 --> 04:25.610
UH, HI.

04:25.710 --> 04:28.310
- OH, WHAT IS THIS, A MILITARY BASE,

04:28.411 --> 04:31.677
OR A DAYCARE CENTER FOR UNDER-EVOLVED BIPEDS?

04:31.778 --> 04:32.944
- SORRY.

04:33.044 --> 04:37.879
THEY'RE JUST HERE UNTIL WE CAN FIND THEIR...

04:37.979 --> 04:39.478
TRIBE.

04:39.578 --> 04:41.513
- LET GO OF ME.

04:41.613 --> 04:44.646

04:44.746 --> 04:48.547
SO LET ME HELP.

[amused grunts]

04:57.782 --> 04:59.882
- [laughs]

04:59.982 --> 05:02.616

05:02.716 --> 05:04.682
BACK TO THEIR TRIBE.

05:04.783 --> 05:06.183
BLACKARACHNIA?

05:06.283 --> 05:07.550
- ME? [scoffs]

05:07.650 --> 05:09.683
GIVE THE JOB TO SOMEONE WHO CAN FLY.

05:09.784 --> 05:13.418
- HMM, NOW OUR SENSORS DON'T REGISTER ORGANICS PROPERLY.

05:13.518 --> 05:16.385
NOT MUCH CHANCE OF LOCATING THE TRIBE FROM THE AIR.

05:16.485 --> 05:20.886
- THE CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO LEAD THE WAY, ON FOOT.

05:20.986 --> 05:23.686
- OH, MAKE MY DAY. A NATURE WALK?

05:23.786 --> 05:25.620
- A DANGEROUS ONE, BUT NECESSARY.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.887
THE CYBER-RAPTORS ARE MEGATRON'S HANDIWORK,

05:27.987 --> 05:31.287
AND YOU KNOW MEGATRON BETTER THAN ANYONE.

05:31.387 --> 05:34.221
- HAVING BEEN HIS LITTLE EIGHT-LEGGED LIEUTENANT.

05:34.321 --> 05:38.089
- RATTRAP, BE QUIET.

05:38.188 --> 05:39.089
- TERRIFIC.

05:39.189 --> 05:41.289
ME AND THE JUNIOR FOREST RANGERS.

05:42.689 --> 05:44.189
WHOA-OH.

05:44.289 --> 05:46.523
- I'LL ACCOMPANY HER. - NEGATIVE.

05:46.623 --> 05:48.257
YOU'VE SUSTAINED DAMAGE.

05:48.357 --> 05:50.490
AND BESIDES, I WANT BLACKARACHNIA'S

05:50.590 --> 05:53.024
FULL ATTENTION ON THE JOB AT HAND.

05:53.124 --> 05:56.591
- I'LL GO WITH HER.

05:56.691 --> 05:58.691
- AGREED.

06:05.560 --> 06:06.993
THE REST OF US WILL STAY HERE.

06:07.093 --> 06:10.560
WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF WORK TO DO INSTALLING THE DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

06:10.660 --> 06:14.728
- [growls]

06:21.362 --> 06:23.596

06:23.695 --> 06:26.496
LOOKING PARTICULARLY BUSHY-TAILED TODAY?

06:26.596 --> 06:27.830
- EH...

06:27.930 --> 06:30.997
IT'S THE WEB LADY I'M WONDERIN' ABOUT.

06:31.097 --> 06:32.597
CALL ME PARANOID,

06:32.697 --> 06:34.764
BUT I DON'T TRUST PREDS,

06:34.864 --> 06:36.498
I DON'T TRUST SPIDERS,

06:36.598 --> 06:39.398
AND I DON'T TRUST DAMES WHO SNEAK IN AND OUT

06:39.498 --> 06:42.232
OF CLASSIFIED AREAS WHEN THEY THINK NOBODY'S WATCHIN'.

06:42.332 --> 06:43.933
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

06:44.033 --> 06:46.666
- EH, I'M SAYIN' THAT OUR LITTLE SPIDER CHUM...

06:46.766 --> 06:50.300
[door opens]

06:50.400 --> 06:52.934
IS A CREDIT TO HER WEB-SPINNIN' SPECIES,

06:53.034 --> 06:55.134
AND I DON'T KNOW

06:55.234 --> 06:59.469
WHAT WE EVER DID WITHOUT HER.

07:07.904 --> 07:10.503
- [grunts]

07:10.603 --> 07:11.904
[grunting] - THAT WAY, HUH?

07:12.004 --> 07:13.371
- MM-HMM.

07:13.471 --> 07:17.105
- OH...

07:17.205 --> 07:18.305
- UGH.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.539
DON'T BUG ME, KID. YOUR FOREHEAD SLOPES.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.040
- [chuckles]

07:28.140 --> 07:30.274
YES, VERY GOOD.

07:30.374 --> 07:34.208
THE PREY IS IN THE FIELD, SO LET THE HUNT BEGIN.

07:34.308 --> 07:36.241
[laughs]

07:39.308 --> 07:42.109
- [laughs]

07:42.209 --> 07:44.242
- READY? HANG ON!

07:44.342 --> 07:46.110
- AAH!

07:46.210 --> 07:48.343
[laughing]

07:48.444 --> 07:50.243
- GUYS.

07:50.343 --> 07:51.811
OH, THEY'RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE,

07:51.911 --> 07:55.244
BUT THEY CAN ACT JUVENILE FOREVER.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.411
HMM.

07:56.511 --> 07:58.312
CAN'T GET A READING.

08:02.512 --> 08:06.113
- [laughs]

08:06.213 --> 08:08.780
[beeps, whirs]

08:08.880 --> 08:11.181
OH. MM.

08:17.382 --> 08:19.715
- UGH.

08:21.682 --> 08:25.683
- OH, TOTALLY CUTE. SHE WANTS TO BE YOU.

08:25.783 --> 08:27.283
- LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT, OKAY?

08:27.383 --> 08:28.616
I'M A BLACK WIDOW SPIDER,

08:28.716 --> 08:31.651
I DON'T MAKE FRIENDS, I CAN'T STAND KIDS,

08:31.751 --> 08:35.385
AND I TRULY DESPISE "CUTE".

08:37.652 --> 08:39.351
OH, POINTLESS.

08:39.452 --> 08:43.920
HOW DO YOU SQUELCH SOMEONE WHO COMMUNICATES IN CAVE PAINTINGS?

08:44.019 --> 08:46.953
- SHE JUST THINKS YOU'RE KINDA COOL.

08:47.053 --> 08:48.454
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:48.554 --> 08:52.254

ONE, BAIL OUTTA HERE LIKE ANY SELF-RESPECTING SPIDER,

09:26.493 --> 09:27.393
OR TWO...

09:27.493 --> 09:29.526
[both whimpering]

09:29.626 --> 09:30.694
- PLAY LITTLE MISS HERO

09:30.793 --> 09:32.394
LIKE SOME SORT OF PATHETIC WARM-BLOOD.

09:32.494 --> 09:34.794

10:02.466 --> 10:04.066
- HERE'S THE PLAN.

10:04.166 --> 10:07.300
YOU FLY THE BRATS BACK TO BASE, THEN COME AND GET ME.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.067
- NOT GONNA WORK. I CAN'T FLY.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.234
MY JETS GOT DAMAGED IN THE FALL.

10:11.334 --> 10:12.733
- OH, GREAT.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.534
I GET STUCK WITH THE ONE CAT IN THE WORLD

10:14.634 --> 10:16.868
WHO LANDS ON HIS HEAD.

10:16.968 --> 10:18.569
- CHEETOR TO OPTIMUS.

10:18.669 --> 10:21.335
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM HERE. [radio static]

10:21.435 --> 10:25.102
- BLACKARACHNIA TO ANYONE. COME IN.

10:25.203 --> 10:27.103
SOMEONE'S JAMMING OUR SIGNALS.

10:27.203 --> 10:30.304
AND THREE GUESSES WHO THAT WOULD BE.

10:30.404 --> 10:34.737
- MY HUMBLE SELF, INDEED.

10:34.838 --> 10:37.971
- THE TRAITORESS CAN NOW BE DESTROYED, ROYALTY.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.005
[chuckles] AND THE CAT AS WELL.

10:40.105 --> 10:41.872
- YES.

10:41.972 --> 10:44.406
BUT NOT TOO QUICKLY.

10:44.506 --> 10:47.573
FOR I HAVE A GREATER PLAN IN MIND.

10:47.673 --> 10:49.940
WASPINATOR, TARANTULUS, TO YOUR MISSION!

10:50.040 --> 10:52.273
- WITH PLEASURE, MEGATRON.

10:52.373 --> 10:53.974
A CHANCE TO FIELD TEST

10:54.074 --> 10:58.875
AN AMUSING LITTLE DEVICE I'VE DEVELOPED.

10:58.975 --> 11:02.509
- AND A FEW COMPANIONS TO AMUSE YOU FURTHER.

11:02.609 --> 11:05.609
- [squealing, growling]

11:05.709 --> 11:10.710
- CRY HAVOC, AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR!

11:14.177 --> 11:17.711
- CHEETOR, BLACKARACHNIA, DO YOU READ ME?

11:17.811 --> 11:19.712
- SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG.

11:19.812 --> 11:22.245
SHE IS IN DANGER. I-I CAN FEEL IT.

11:22.345 --> 11:23.712
- EH, MAYBE THE TWO OF 'EM

11:23.812 --> 11:26.179
JUST DECIDED TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.

11:26.279 --> 11:28.180
[chuckles]

11:28.279 --> 11:32.047
- IF THAT INNUENDO WERE NOT BENEATH MY CONTEMPT, RODENT,

11:32.147 --> 11:34.981
YOU WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GIVE SATISFACTION.

11:35.081 --> 11:38.748
- I FORGET. DID HE TALK LIKE THIS BEFORE?

11:38.849 --> 11:41.982
OR DID FALLIN' IN LOVE DO SOMETHIN' TO HIS CIRCUITS?

11:42.082 --> 11:44.149
- I DON'T LIKE THIS EITHER.

11:44.249 --> 11:46.382
I'M GONNA FLY OUT AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND.

11:46.483 --> 11:47.883
- I'M COMING WITH YOU.

11:47.983 --> 11:49.717
- I CAN HANDLE IT, SILVERBOLT.

11:49.816 --> 11:51.484
BESIDES, YOU'RE NEEDED HERE.

11:51.584 --> 11:54.218
- IF MY LADY IS IN DANGER,

11:54.318 --> 11:57.051
THEN MY PLACE IS AT HER SIDE.

11:57.151 --> 12:00.152
- [sighs] AS YOU WISH.

12:00.252 --> 12:04.486
YOU TWO STAY HERE, AND DOUBLE-CHECK THE DEFENSES.

12:07.620 --> 12:09.487
- EH, TYPICAL.

12:09.587 --> 12:11.187
WHO GETS STUCK WITH ALL THE WORK?

12:11.287 --> 12:12.987
THE RAT GETS STUCK WITH ALL THE WORK,

12:13.087 --> 12:16.088
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE GOES ON A SLAGGIN' PICNIC.

12:23.455 --> 12:27.957
- AHH, EXACTLY AS I ANTICIPATED.

12:28.057 --> 12:31.524
THE BASE IS UNDERMANNED AND UNPROTECTED.

12:31.624 --> 12:33.457
OURS FOR THE ASKING.

12:33.557 --> 12:36.024
- AW, NOW WE AIN'T GONNA ASK, ARE WE?

12:36.125 --> 12:38.825
HOW'S ABOUT WE JUST BLAST OUR WAY IN THERE

12:38.925 --> 12:41.959
AND SLAG EVERYBODY AND TAKE IT?

15:18.018 --> 15:21.318
- ROYALTY, WHY WAS I NOT CHOSEN?

15:21.418 --> 15:25.652
- BECAUSE, INFERNO, WHEN EXPECTING BOOBY TRAPS...

15:25.752 --> 15:27.820
