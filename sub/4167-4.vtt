WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:03.913
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:03.996 --> 00:07.333
I got busted.
Head of campus security at Valley State.

00:07.416 --> 00:08.417
You just got jacked.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.169
Here. This is yours.

00:10.252 --> 00:13.339
If you need protection on campus,
just ask for me.

00:13.422 --> 00:15.841
You still owe me 150 G's, lady!

00:15.925 --> 00:19.053
How am I supposed to put food on my table
if you keep upping my debt?

00:19.136 --> 00:21.180
Get a fucking job.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.307
Chop that shit up. Move it.

00:23.390 --> 00:24.475
Can you grow here?

00:24.558 --> 00:27.519
Hell, yeah. It's perfect.
Shame it's all gonna be for U-Turn.

00:27.603 --> 00:31.774
Silas Botwin, you're sentenced
to six months' community service.

00:32.524 --> 00:36.946
Injuries such as yours may have rendered you
unfit for duty in the past but times have changed.

00:37.029 --> 00:38.530
- What?
- Welcome to the army.

00:38.614 --> 00:41.158
Your battle buddy is like a Siamese twin.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.743
You're gonna shit when I shit.

00:42.826 --> 00:46.455
- Why are you doing this?
- I laid everything on the line for you,

00:46.539 --> 00:47.581
and you fucked me.

00:47.665 --> 00:48.958
Kesheshian says "goodbye".

00:49.041 --> 00:51.001
- Peter? He's dead?
- Yes!

00:51.085 --> 00:54.171
I'll tell you how you can help me now.
Make the bags lighter.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.798
Agent Fundis, DEA.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.841
I'm here to talk about Peter Scottson.

01:03.222 --> 01:06.225
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:06.308 --> 01:10.020
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:10.104 --> 01:13.440
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:13.524 --> 01:16.902
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:16.986 --> 01:19.905
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

01:19.989 --> 01:23.617
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:23.701 --> 01:26.996
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:27.079 --> 01:30.207
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:32.751 --> 01:36.630
<i># And the boys go into business</i>

01:36.714 --> 01:39.133
<i># And marry and raise a family</i>

01:39.216 --> 01:43.137
<i># In boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:43.220 --> 01:52.897
<i># And they all look just the same #</i>

01:55.524 --> 01:58.527
Erm, we broke up,

01:58.611 --> 02:01.155
me and Peter Scottson.

02:01.238 --> 02:04.867
He hasn't come in to work for a few days,
and we haven't heard from him.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.660
It's unusual.

02:06.744 --> 02:08.662
Oh, well,

02:09.997 --> 02:12.124
I don't know.

02:12.208 --> 02:16.003
- We broke up.
- Look, Mrs. Botwin, I'm his partner.

02:16.086 --> 02:18.255
- The one who burps?
- It's reflux.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.090
When did you last speak with him?

02:20.799 --> 02:23.719
Er... A few days ago. He brought oranges.

02:23.802 --> 02:25.930
- Do you want them?
- Why would I want them?

02:26.013 --> 02:27.890
I have no idea.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.516
Erm...

02:29.600 --> 02:33.896
- Listen, we broke up.
- I think we established that.

02:33.979 --> 02:36.649
When he brought the citrus over,
did he say anything?

02:36.732 --> 02:39.652
Where he was going?
What he might be up to? Work stuff?

02:39.735 --> 02:41.028
No.

02:41.111 --> 02:42.696
He didn't talk about work much.

02:42.780 --> 02:47.034
I didn't even know what he did
till I tried on his jacket once by mistake.

02:47.117 --> 02:49.411
I was cold and I had to pee.

02:50.788 --> 02:56.085
Erm, about the break-up, we were just,
you know, at different places.

02:56.168 --> 02:59.588
I think we just wanted different things.

02:59.672 --> 03:03.300
I think he was working on some
undercover investigation on his own,

03:03.384 --> 03:05.719
which is stupid,
but even when he goes indie,

03:05.803 --> 03:09.098
he calls to let me know everything's fine.

03:09.181 --> 03:11.433
He knows I worry.

03:12.851 --> 03:14.353
I hope nothing's wrong.

03:14.436 --> 03:18.691
Well, if you hear from Peter,
I'd like you to give me a call.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.324
He really liked you.

03:30.202 --> 03:32.329
Thanks for your time, Mrs. Botwin.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.135
Where is Peter?

03:47.136 --> 03:48.512
We broke up.

03:49.388 --> 03:51.807
Is that gonna be a problem?

03:53.475 --> 03:56.061
- No.
- What makes you so sure?

03:56.145 --> 03:57.897
Mommy just knows.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.736
Behold, the incorporated city of Majestic.

04:03.819 --> 04:07.781
A city experiencing a rate of growth
few people could have anticipated.

04:07.865 --> 04:12.286
Now, we've been a noisy neighbour,
and for that I want to apologise.

04:12.369 --> 04:17.416
That sound you heard coming
from the east, the west, the north.

04:17.499 --> 04:21.253
Houses popping up
like so many California wildflowers.

04:21.337 --> 04:26.926
Well, that is the sound
of an economic miracle.

04:27.009 --> 04:29.220
A month ago, our own City Council

04:29.303 --> 04:32.181
had a session trying
to come up with a new town logo,

04:32.264 --> 04:35.267
something we could put
on our signs, our brochures.

04:41.190 --> 04:46.153
Italy is shaped like a boot.
Sicily, the ball that's about to be kicked.

04:46.237 --> 04:51.242
Majestic is shaped like a, well,
some people say a horseshoe,

04:51.325 --> 04:53.160
others, a smile.

04:54.203 --> 04:57.748
But for some of us who are aware
of a particular infrastructure problem

04:57.831 --> 05:01.210
facing Majestic,
well, we saw a different image.

05:04.755 --> 05:10.427
In the midst of all our back-slapping, we forgot
a fundamental principle of smart growth.

05:10.761 --> 05:13.430
If you're gonna poop,
make sure you can flush.

05:15.599 --> 05:18.018
What we need is a bowl.

05:19.311 --> 05:22.481
Agrestic is that bowl.

05:22.565 --> 05:25.526
Now, in exchange for the right to redirect

05:25.609 --> 05:28.654
a small portion of our sewage
through your town,

05:28.737 --> 05:30.948
we'll retrofit your existing sewage system

05:31.031 --> 05:34.577
with the most advanced technology
available at no cost to you.

05:37.580 --> 05:41.917
We'll also grant you unrestricted access
to all our recreational facilities,

05:42.001 --> 05:46.755
including our non-denominational
modern house of worship,

05:46.839 --> 05:51.760
the Absolute Truth Ministry of Majestic.

05:51.844 --> 05:54.263
Now, I know these are tough times
for Agrestic.

05:54.346 --> 05:59.310
Your tax base is shrinking while the cost
of maintaining basic services is rising.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.854
It doesn't have to be that way.

06:04.356 --> 06:06.567
We're neighbours.

06:06.650 --> 06:12.531
And this is a hand extended over the fence.

06:14.325 --> 06:17.494
- Thank you, Mr. Groff.
- Sullivan. Please.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.996
Sullivan.

06:19.663 --> 06:21.999
Dumb name.

06:22.833 --> 06:25.753
- Education?
- Two and a half semesters at Berkeley.

06:25.836 --> 06:30.299
Graduated Berkeley with honours.

06:30.382 --> 06:33.719
No lying. They can check these things.

06:33.802 --> 06:36.013
This is Agrestic. No one's gonna check.

06:36.096 --> 06:40.476
You're gonna look lame and stay unemployed
if you don't lie cos everybody else does.

06:40.559 --> 06:45.439
Shane, remember that guy
who came to the door last night?

06:45.522 --> 06:47.399
- Peter's friend?
- Yeah.

06:47.483 --> 06:50.027
You haven't seen him lurking around
or anything, have you?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.821
- Seen his Impala parked around?
- Lurking?

06:52.905 --> 06:56.367
- Lurking.
- No, I haven't. Why would he be lurking?

06:56.450 --> 06:58.953
- Does he know you're a drug dealer?
- No. I don't think so.

06:59.036 --> 07:02.498
I just... I hear he's a lurker.

07:02.581 --> 07:06.669
- Mom, can you type?
- With two fingers.

07:08.254 --> 07:12.508
Proficient typing skills.

07:12.591 --> 07:14.343
Now, what kind of job do you want?

07:14.426 --> 07:18.639
Anything, so long as there's no
folding, lifting or scooping involved.

07:18.722 --> 07:21.850
Then, I'll give you
a graduate degree in English,

07:21.934 --> 07:23.727
and we'll take it from there.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.187
Let's not overdo it.

07:26.397 --> 07:28.732
I'm just proud of you.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.235
What for?

07:32.528 --> 07:33.946
Getting a real job.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.036
Well, thank you, Shane.

07:45.207 --> 07:48.085
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Come on!

07:48.168 --> 07:49.795
Get your asses over here right now!

07:49.879 --> 07:53.465
Go. Move it out. Go buy wings, Rodriguez.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.928
Get your cock-violated asshole
up that rope, Botwin.

07:58.012 --> 08:01.974
So help me, if you don't, I will rip out
your goddamn large intestine

08:02.057 --> 08:04.518
and string you up
by your tiny little pecker with it.

08:04.602 --> 08:06.812
- How fucking cool is this?
- We're gonna die.

08:06.896 --> 08:10.190
- Let's go. Move it.
- Actually, you're gonna die.

08:10.274 --> 08:13.319
I'm gonna hide under your corpse
till everybody's gone.

08:13.402 --> 08:17.489
I ain't gonna be nobody's dead-body blanket.
We're gonna get them first.

08:17.573 --> 08:21.827
We don't speak the language.
We know nothing about their culture.

08:21.911 --> 08:24.496
We'll have the newest
fuck-you-up-good technology.

08:24.580 --> 08:25.873
Insurgents are dead meat.

08:25.956 --> 08:27.291
We're the fucking insurgents.

08:27.374 --> 08:30.878
Dude. We're the goddamn USA.
We're the best.

08:30.961 --> 08:34.465
We're the coolest, richest,
most righteous nation on Earth.

08:34.548 --> 08:37.885
We're a debt-laden nation
of religious hypocrites.

08:37.967 --> 08:42.014
All we do well is shop
and drive gas-guzzling SUVs.

08:42.097 --> 08:43.432
You're fucking un-American.

08:43.515 --> 08:48.854
Botwin! Rodriguez! Get your corn-holing,
shit-stained asses over here, front and centre.

08:48.938 --> 08:52.066
What's with all the recurring
homophobic images?

08:52.149 --> 08:54.443
Starting to worry about this guy.

08:54.526 --> 08:57.488
They're onto you, man.
You're gonna get court-martialled

08:57.571 --> 09:00.241
for all that Muslim-loving shit
you've been spouting.

09:00.324 --> 09:02.451
Yeah? They're calling you over, too.

09:02.535 --> 09:04.537
Oh. Oh.

09:07.164 --> 09:09.124
I want you to return to your barracks,

09:09.208 --> 09:12.044
change into fresh greens,
and report to me in nine minutes.

09:12.127 --> 09:15.714
- Not eight, not ten. Is that clear?
- What's up?

09:15.798 --> 09:20.219
Botwin, you do not ever ask
a commanding officer what's up.

09:20.302 --> 09:23.472
He's not your fucking friend.
He's your goddamn master,

09:23.556 --> 09:25.099
your motherfucking god.

09:25.182 --> 09:26.892
- You hear me, sperm breath?
- Yeah.

09:26.976 --> 09:29.228
- It's, "Yes, Sergeant. "
- Yes, Sergeant.

09:29.311 --> 09:30.521
Fall out.

09:30.604 --> 09:33.566
Move it. Pretend I'm getting ready
to put my foot up your...

09:35.025 --> 09:37.486
Wow. Lights on the church work.

09:37.570 --> 09:40.155
- How awesome is this?
- Come on, Doug.

09:40.239 --> 09:41.323
It's my turn.

09:45.536 --> 09:48.998
So, are we prepared to commit our city
to being Majestic's bowl

09:49.081 --> 09:51.542
because the guy next door
brought over a cool model?

09:51.625 --> 09:53.794
- I'm not 100% sold.
- Do you understand the numbers?

09:53.878 --> 09:55.087
- I do.
- And?

09:55.170 --> 09:59.383
And we have to be able to renegotiate
on our terms and not theirs, otherwise we...

09:59.466 --> 10:01.093
What's going on?

10:02.761 --> 10:05.180
I thought that we dealt with this last night.

10:06.181 --> 10:07.683
- We did.
- Uh-huh.

10:07.766 --> 10:11.103
- Why are you here?
- Why am I here?

10:11.186 --> 10:13.147
- Why is he here?
- Slumming.

10:13.230 --> 10:15.107
- Yeah.
- And it's a good thing, too.

10:15.190 --> 10:18.193
No one here knows his ass
from a spreadsheet in the ground.

10:18.277 --> 10:20.905
Or her ass, as the case may be.

10:20.988 --> 10:24.366
Well, thanks for coming by,
but we don't need you.

10:24.450 --> 10:27.119
We agreed to hire
an independent accountant

10:27.203 --> 10:29.747
who is gonna walk us
through the entire proposal.

10:30.414 --> 10:32.333
It's in the minutes.

10:33.209 --> 10:36.587
- Right, Sarah?
- The city coffers are empty, Celia.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.465
Doug, what's your take
on this Majestic proposal?

10:39.548 --> 10:43.552
Basically, Majestic's overflowing
river of crap has got no place to go

10:43.636 --> 10:46.972
but through us like a fiscal colonic.

10:47.056 --> 10:48.474
We got them by the sphincter.

10:50.267 --> 10:54.230
- Shit highway could be our road to riches.
- Our road to riches?

10:54.313 --> 10:58.234
You know, the last time I checked,
you weren't even on the Council.

10:59.777 --> 11:06.075
Graduated Berkeley with honours.
Associate editor, Oxford University Press.

11:06.158 --> 11:08.536
- What division were you in?
- Sorry?

11:08.619 --> 11:13.457
What division?
Academic books, reference, trade?

11:13.541 --> 11:16.460
Academic. Textbooks mostly.

11:16.544 --> 11:21.632
History. Lots of Civil War stuff. Reconstruction.

11:22.132 --> 11:23.801
And how did you like New York?

11:23.884 --> 11:29.265
Oh, it was big, dirty. Lots of people.

11:32.101 --> 11:34.562
Coconut. Nice.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.274
You're a very beautiful woman.

11:40.109 --> 11:43.571
I bet you look good
rolling right out of bed in the morning,

11:43.654 --> 11:45.489
or in it the night before.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.244
I have my moments.

11:50.327 --> 11:54.164
If I hire you, I'll be paying for the right
to make comments like that. You OK with that?

11:54.248 --> 11:57.042
As long as you're OK
with being shot down every time.

11:57.126 --> 12:00.462
I like you, Nancy Botwin.
You're an operator.

12:00.546 --> 12:05.342
The résumé's bullshit, of course,
but the mind is there.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.344
Here's what I do.

12:07.428 --> 12:09.054
I sell values-based communities,

12:09.138 --> 12:11.599
which means that I, and you,
need to act the part.

12:11.682 --> 12:15.519
Crucifix pin on the lapel, a smile on the face,
and a pleasant word for everyone.

12:15.603 --> 12:18.063
No fucking the construction crews
like my former assistant

12:18.147 --> 12:20.107
and then broadcasting it on the Internet.

12:20.190 --> 12:23.611
Oh, I don't do porn so much anymore.
I found it very tiring.

12:25.362 --> 12:30.159
Now, Majestic is my ninth community
and by far the most ambitious.

12:30.242 --> 12:33.078
A lot comes through that door every day
that needs to be dealt with.

12:33.162 --> 12:36.540
For instance, today I need to find
personalised gifts for every member

12:36.624 --> 12:40.085
of the Agrestic City Council,
and I have no idea what they'd like.

12:40.169 --> 12:42.630
I can do that.
I know the people on the Council.

12:42.713 --> 12:46.675
I figured as much, since it was Celia Hodes
who recommended that I speak to you.

12:46.759 --> 12:50.387
- Celia?
- I think this is what's referred to as kismet.

12:56.644 --> 12:58.604
Hey, spaceshot.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.066
You just got yourself a job.

13:03.734 --> 13:06.487
- You start Monday.
- Ooh!

13:08.989 --> 13:12.159
Can't believe they expect us
to do this job straight.

13:12.243 --> 13:13.244
Qué?

13:16.789 --> 13:19.500
- Yeah.
- Si. Muy bien.

13:22.503 --> 13:24.088
Mrs. Gruber?

13:24.171 --> 13:28.509
Silas, did you know that if you drink
and take Ambien,

13:28.592 --> 13:31.845
you can randomly black out
and run your car into a boulder?

13:31.929 --> 13:33.722
Totalled the Volvo.

13:33.806 --> 13:36.058
Who's that cute Latino guy?

13:37.518 --> 13:38.686
Hey.

13:41.313 --> 13:44.066
It's so hot.

13:44.149 --> 13:45.234
Yeah.

13:45.693 --> 13:48.070
Why don't you take your shirt off?

13:49.029 --> 13:50.489
I'm fine.

13:50.573 --> 13:52.783
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

13:52.867 --> 13:56.787
You're young and lean, like ostrich meat.

13:56.871 --> 14:00.165
Erm, have you been drinking, Mrs. Gruber?

14:00.249 --> 14:01.500
Don't tell.

14:01.584 --> 14:05.254
Anyway, it isn't illegal
unless you're behind the wheel of a car, is it?

14:05.921 --> 14:07.882
I guess not.

14:07.965 --> 14:09.174
I'm wet.

14:16.891 --> 14:19.101
How you know how high to hang those lights?

14:19.184 --> 14:23.147
30 inches above the plant makes for
optimum lumen output in a space this size.

14:23.230 --> 14:27.109
- And you got to control the temperature?
- Not just temperature, also humidity

14:27.192 --> 14:29.028
so the plant don't grow bacteria and fungus.

14:29.111 --> 14:33.157
And anything else you want to know,
I'm a wealth of information.

14:33.240 --> 14:37.661
You impressed, aren't you? You like,
"Wow, Conrad know what he talking about. "

14:37.745 --> 14:40.497
Yeah, if you're dick was
half as smart as your brain,

14:40.581 --> 14:43.959
you would've stayed far away
from that girl like I told you.

14:45.377 --> 14:48.505
If we gonna work together,
you got to get off my dick, dumb as it might be.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.634
Ain't gonna happen otherwise.

14:53.385 --> 14:54.970
Fair enough.

14:55.054 --> 15:00.643
They need us, and we need them.
Let's be their bowl.

15:02.311 --> 15:05.856
No. This is a closed session, Mr. Wilson.

15:05.940 --> 15:07.274
Hold that thought.

15:08.567 --> 15:10.194
I have an announcement to make.

15:10.277 --> 15:14.490
For personal reasons, I've decided to
give up my position on the City Council.

15:14.573 --> 15:16.450
- In accordance with...
- For fuck's sake.

15:16.534 --> 15:20.704
...section 324, paragraph C,
we are hereby compelled to elect

15:20.788 --> 15:24.041
an interim council member to replace me
until the next election.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.168
I'm opening up the floor to nominations.

15:26.252 --> 15:29.213
- I nominate Doug Wilson.
- I second the Doug Wilson nomination.

15:29.296 --> 15:33.509
All those in favour of electing Doug Wilson
as interim council member say aye.

15:33.592 --> 15:35.427
- Aye.
- Oh, you guys.

15:35.511 --> 15:36.720
All those against?

15:36.804 --> 15:38.347
- Nay.
- The resolution passes.

15:38.430 --> 15:41.559
Doug Wilson will take my seat,
effective immediately.

15:41.642 --> 15:44.645
- No, this can't possibly be legal.
- It is.

15:44.728 --> 15:47.606
- And what makes you so sure?
- I wrote the bylaws.

15:47.690 --> 15:51.360
So, now that that's that, I would like to open up
a new order of business.

15:51.443 --> 15:53.529
Since there's no longer a conflict of interest,

15:53.612 --> 15:59.201
I would like to nominate Mitch Kamin
to contract all requisite landscaping

15:59.285 --> 16:02.162
that will accompany shit highway.

16:02.246 --> 16:03.831
Yeah.

16:03.914 --> 16:07.585
- This is bullshit.
- No, Celia, it's human shit.

16:07.668 --> 16:09.503
You got to get on the same page with us.

16:09.587 --> 16:11.964
I'm not gonna allow this to happen.

16:12.047 --> 16:16.760
You are not going to turn this
into your little corrupt kingdom again.

16:16.844 --> 16:20.681
This time there's going to be
checks and balances.

16:20.764 --> 16:23.142
There's going to be oversight.

16:23.767 --> 16:26.020
Are you hearing me?

16:26.103 --> 16:27.438
I'm shaking.

16:28.981 --> 16:30.149
Nazdorovia!

16:30.232 --> 16:32.276
Oh!

16:32.359 --> 16:36.113
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Pass it down. Pass it down.

16:36.197 --> 16:38.240
Here's to shit! Fill them up. Let's go.

16:42.953 --> 16:47.082
Mommy got a job. Ice cream for everybody.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.918
I'm the only one home.

16:49.001 --> 16:51.629
Well, then, more for us.

16:53.297 --> 16:55.299
What's your job?

16:55.382 --> 16:59.136
I'm the new West Coast head
of Random House.

16:59.220 --> 17:02.640
Mom, that's great. I told you. Yes!

17:03.432 --> 17:09.104
Actually, I'm the executive assistant
to the head of the Majestic project.

17:10.189 --> 17:12.608
By the way, darling,
they do check résumés.

17:12.691 --> 17:15.778
So, let's thank God
Mommy smells like coconut.

17:23.577 --> 17:25.496
- Hello.
- Where the fuck's my money?

17:25.579 --> 17:28.332
Hold on. I'll be right back, sweetie.

17:32.127 --> 17:33.963
Hey, guess what. I got a job.

17:34.046 --> 17:38.050
Your job is being my bitch.
Where the fuck is my money?

17:38.801 --> 17:42.096
OK, I'm having a little difficulty
moving your brick at the moment.

17:42.179 --> 17:46.308
It's motherfucking weed. Everybody love
that shit. Sell it and bring me the money.

17:46.392 --> 17:47.893
The DEA came to my house.

17:47.977 --> 17:50.437
- I can't make a move right now.
- The fuck you can't.

17:50.521 --> 17:53.691
DEA been up my ass since I popped
out of my mama's sacred place,

17:53.774 --> 17:56.402
and that don't stop me one bit. Fuck them.

17:56.485 --> 17:58.070
I don't have your confidence.

17:58.153 --> 17:59.947
Then find it, bitch.

18:00.030 --> 18:02.908
Fuck, Yevgeny. Not so hard.

18:03.701 --> 18:07.204
Look, I want my money. You hear me?

18:07.288 --> 18:11.542
Sell the weed to the fucking DEA all I care.
No more excuses.

18:21.886 --> 18:25.347
<i>- City and state, please.
- Santa Lejos, California.</i>

18:25.431 --> 18:28.809
<i>- Listing?
- Valley State campus security.</i>

18:32.479 --> 18:37.109
Erm... I don't mean to quibble, Mrs. Botwin.

18:37.193 --> 18:41.113
I don't want to invite
another visit from your friends, but...

18:41.197 --> 18:43.365
some of these bags look a little light to me.

18:44.074 --> 18:47.953
Look, I assure you they're not light.
It's just an airy blend.

18:48.746 --> 18:51.665
- Look, you want it or not.
- Yeah, I'll take it.

18:51.749 --> 18:56.337
I don't have the money on me,
so I'll be right back.

18:56.420 --> 19:00.841
- Why would you not bring the money?
- I don't know. You make me nervous.

19:01.884 --> 19:03.969
I make you nervous?

19:04.053 --> 19:06.889
Yeah. You're scary.

19:06.972 --> 19:10.476
You're this scary
lady drug dealer with thugs.

19:10.559 --> 19:12.186
That's me.

19:12.269 --> 19:15.814
Go get the money. Leave the bag.
Go get the money. Now.

19:15.898 --> 19:17.483
OK, OK. I'll be right back.

19:17.566 --> 19:19.109
That's right. You will.

19:23.322 --> 19:27.076
Erm... I have to drive to where the money is.

19:27.159 --> 19:33.207
So, you want to come with me
or wait here or what?

19:33.290 --> 19:37.169
I'll wait here.
I'll be right over there on that bench, OK?

19:37.253 --> 19:39.380
- Yeah.
- Make it snappy.

20:01.527 --> 20:03.028
This is boring.

20:03.571 --> 20:06.073
Gets us out of that
fucking obstacle course.

20:08.492 --> 20:10.244
All right, give me that phone.

20:10.703 --> 20:14.498
- They said not to fuck with it.
- I'm not gonna fuck with it. I just wanna look at it.

20:15.624 --> 20:16.709
Come on.

20:19.128 --> 20:21.338
What do you think would happen
if we made a call?

20:21.422 --> 20:24.550
We're not supposed to make calls.
We're just supposed to turn it on,

20:24.633 --> 20:28.220
stand here,
and let some drone take pictures of us.

20:30.264 --> 20:32.558
- What are you doing?
- Making a postcard.

20:34.476 --> 20:36.103
Hey, that's funny.

20:37.187 --> 20:39.565
- Give me your lighter.
- What for?

20:39.648 --> 20:41.942
I want you to take a picture of me
lighting my fart.

20:42.026 --> 20:44.111
OK, that's the spirit.

21:16.685 --> 21:17.811
Hey.

21:18.479 --> 21:20.773
Jesus, lady.
I thought you were someone else.

21:26.278 --> 21:28.739
Come on. Come on!

21:28.822 --> 21:31.534
Oh, this phone has video.
We can make a movie.

21:31.617 --> 21:32.910
- Fuck.
- What's the matter?

21:32.993 --> 21:35.746
- I got nothing. I'm tensing up.
- Fuck. Give me that.

21:37.706 --> 21:39.917
Let me show you how it's done. All right?

21:41.210 --> 21:43.379
OK, OK, hold on.

21:43.462 --> 21:45.589
Now point the camera at my ass. Hurry.

21:45.673 --> 21:47.800
I don't wanna see your balls, man.
Tuck them in.

21:47.883 --> 21:51.178
All right, there, there, fine. Ready?

21:51.262 --> 21:55.057
OK. It's coming, and it's a good one.
Here it comes.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.601
- Hey, what is that?
- It's show time.

21:59.270 --> 22:00.354
Fuck.

22:06.861 --> 22:08.195
Holy shit.

22:09.905 --> 22:12.199
OK, something.

22:14.410 --> 22:15.953
Something, something.

22:17.997 --> 22:19.206
Evidence.

22:23.544 --> 22:25.504
Sorry, battle buddy.

22:36.223 --> 22:38.851
- Merci, merci, madame.
- Please.

22:40.936 --> 22:43.063
Just like Paris, huh?

22:44.690 --> 22:47.860
- Sullivan.
- I owe you a thank you.

22:47.943 --> 22:52.031
Your friend, Nancy,
she's gonna work out. Thanks.

22:52.114 --> 22:55.242
Honestly, the poor thing
could really use help.

22:56.368 --> 23:00.331
Entering the job market,
you know, at her age.

23:02.791 --> 23:06.337
That crouton thing they do
on top of the soup, not good.

23:07.171 --> 23:09.882
Try the croque-monsieur next time,
or the quiche.

23:10.466 --> 23:13.302
You seem to know your way around here.

23:13.385 --> 23:15.179
I travel a lot.

23:15.262 --> 23:18.015
There's a Café Deux Mercis
in just about every city.

23:18.098 --> 23:21.977
Same menu,
same framed posters, same smell.

23:24.772 --> 23:28.317
There's a certain
comforting predictability to it.

23:30.528 --> 23:34.657
- You live around here?
- Sort of. Yeah, yeah.

23:34.740 --> 23:39.286
I sort of... I'm in a hotel, temporarily.

23:39.370 --> 23:43.290
Are you in the All Suites?
That's where I am.

23:43.374 --> 23:47.753
No. No, I'm staying
in one of the other ones.

23:51.924 --> 23:55.219
Listen, what do you say we dump this crap

23:55.302 --> 23:58.722
and go someplace where the lighting's
better and there's a full bar?

23:58.806 --> 23:59.890
I'm buying.

24:00.849 --> 24:04.728
Yeah, thank you.
I think maybe another time, though.

24:04.812 --> 24:07.815
Ah, I insist. Why eat alone?

24:08.607 --> 24:12.778
I actually have some place I need to be.

24:12.862 --> 24:14.780
Totally forgot.

24:14.864 --> 24:20.035
I'm sorry. I have to go now.

24:20.661 --> 24:23.581
Thank you, though.

24:23.664 --> 24:26.083
Yeah. A rain check.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.170
Should you reconsider.

24:31.714 --> 24:33.507
A bientôt, mademoiselle.

25:04.330 --> 25:05.956
<i>First new message.</i>

25:06.040 --> 25:11.629
<i>You been dodging my calls, bitch.
Did you move my brick? I want my money.</i>

25:11.712 --> 25:15.633
<i>If I don't hear from you soon,
I'm gonna pay you and yours a little visit.</i>

25:15.716 --> 25:20.179
<i>I got a guy on payroll that just thinks up
fucked-up shit to do to people.</i>

25:21.513 --> 25:23.140
<i>Next message.</i>

25:25.184 --> 25:28.520
- You're gonna be late.
- It's OK.

25:33.025 --> 25:37.613
You know, this community service thing
is totally unsupervised.

25:38.989 --> 25:43.494
Every morning they tell me
where to go and what to do,

25:44.370 --> 25:47.831
but no one even bothers to check
and see if I show up or not.

25:47.915 --> 25:49.917
I still want you showing up.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.210
The thing is,

25:52.586 --> 25:56.840
I can pretty much do anything I want.
No one's watching me.

25:57.925 --> 26:00.928
- No one.
- I'm watching.

26:01.011 --> 26:06.725
Plus, I meet lots of really cool people.
People who like to have fun.

26:08.936 --> 26:11.397
People who would pay to have fun.

26:14.942 --> 26:19.154
This is a non-starter.
I will never let you deal.

26:20.364 --> 26:21.907
You don't have a choice.

26:24.785 --> 26:26.078
I know you don't.

26:26.662 --> 26:28.372
It's too dangerous.

26:31.292 --> 26:33.002
I don't want this for you.

26:34.253 --> 26:35.629
Come back here.

26:40.259 --> 26:42.136
We'll discuss this later.

26:44.430 --> 26:45.598
<i># Hey, marijuana</i>

26:45.681 --> 26:47.641
