\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hStewie?
What are you doing up?

00:38.495 --> 00:41.396
\h\h\hLois had three lattes
and a bottle of wine today,

00:44.132 --> 00:47.132
so her breast milk was
basically a speedball.\h\h\h\h-You?
-I’m writing.

00:44.132 --> 00:47.132
\h\h\hThe last two months I’ve
really gotten my act together.

00:47.132 --> 00:50.594
\hI stopped drinking, and I’m
about to self-publish a book.

00:50.594 --> 00:52.462
\hUgh. None of the
big boys bit, huh?

00:52.462 --> 00:55.198
No, it’s fine. I’m actually
\h\h\hat a point in my life

00:55.198 --> 00:57.528
\hwhere I don’t need
external validation.

00:57.528 --> 00:59.594
\h\h\hI’m just proud of
accomplishing my goal.

00:59.594 --> 01:01.099
\h\h\hThat’s great.
I’m happy for you.

01:01.099 --> 01:02.561
Even if your privilege
\h\h\h\h\h\his showing.

01:02.561 --> 01:04.099
\h\h\h\hPrivilege?
I worked hard to...

01:04.099 --> 01:06.165
Ooh, white fragility much,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBrian?

01:06.165 --> 01:08.429
Okay, maybe I’ve had
\hcertain advantages,

01:08.429 --> 01:09.528
-but how...
\h\h\h-How?

01:09.528 --> 01:10.528
It’s not our job

01:10.528 --> 01:12.462
\h\h\h\h\hto solve
your problems, pal.

01:12.462 --> 01:13.660
-Do the work.
\h\h\h\h-Our?

01:13.660 --> 01:15.660
I-- Who are you even
\h\h\htalking about?

01:15.660 --> 01:17.363
\h\h\hWell, not you,
you big honky Karen.

01:17.363 --> 01:20.396
Ha. I’m just, I’m just
riding your jock, Bri.

01:20.396 --> 01:22.165
That’s amazing you wrote a book.

01:22.165 --> 01:22.693
Well, thanks.

01:22.693 --> 01:23.726
You know, I’m having a little

01:23.726 --> 01:25.099
publishing party on Thursday.

01:25.099 --> 01:26.099
I’d love it if you could come.

01:26.099 --> 01:29.627
Yeah. Uh, Rupert, do we have
\h\h\h\hanything on Thursday?

01:30.033 --> 01:32.396
Okay, then, looks like
\h\h\hwe’re good to go.

01:32.396 --> 01:36.660
\h\hAwesome. All right, Stewie.
I’m gonna go get some shut-eye.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.759
Way to think fast, you dope.

01:40.528 --> 01:45.165
Now we have to go.You can’t?!

01:40.528 --> 01:45.165
Oh, now you have something
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hon Thursday?

01:49.165 --> 01:50.660
Griffin, what are you doing?

01:50.660 --> 01:52.264
\h\hOh, hey, Preston,
I’m glad you’re here.

01:52.264 --> 01:57.099
I’m about to test the prototype
for "Deskpoline."

01:57.099 --> 02:00.759
Oh... Top will need
\h\h\hto be bouncy.

02:00.759 --> 02:02.165
Anyway, what can I do you for?

02:02.165 --> 02:04.462
\h\hI’m sorry to say
I have some bad news.

02:04.462 --> 02:06.165
Well, that was tough
\h\h\h\hto hear, sir,

02:06.165 --> 02:08.000
but thanks for giving it
\h\h\h\h\hto me straight.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.099
I haven’t even told you yet.

02:09.099 --> 02:11.297
Stella will be gone
\h\hfor six weeks.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.330
She’s taking a bereavement
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hleave.

02:13.330 --> 02:14.099
Her husband died?

02:14.099 --> 02:17.561
Okay, Peter, you got six weeks
\h\h\h\h\h\hto lose 100 pounds

02:17.561 --> 02:19.759
and get divorced.
\hLet’s do this.

02:19.759 --> 02:21.264
No, Peter, it was her cat.

02:21.264 --> 02:24.231
Employees now get six weeks to
\h\h\hmourn the loss of a pet.

02:24.231 --> 02:29.000
\h\h\h\hIt’s our way of saying,
"Your animal died, so thanks."

02:29.000 --> 02:30.528
\h\h\h\h\hWait, hang on,
let me get this straight.

02:30.528 --> 02:32.066
If your pet dies,

02:32.066 --> 02:33.528
you get six weeks off?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.000
Yes.

02:36.099 --> 02:40.561
Let’s see how long you last
\h\hwith no brakes, Brian.

02:51.066 --> 02:52.627
(squeaking)

02:52.627 --> 02:55.231
Huh, brake’s out.

02:55.231 --> 02:58.528
Nice try, Peter. Fortunately,
\h\h\h\hyou can stop a Prius

02:58.528 --> 03:01.198
by cupping the wind.

03:10.033 --> 03:13.165
Hello, and welcome
\hto Quahog Books.

03:13.165 --> 03:16.759
\hAll we ask is that you please
don’t see what you want in here

03:16.759 --> 03:21.198
\h\hand then just order it
from Amazon on your phone.

03:21.363 --> 03:26.033
\h\h\h\h\hAnd now, reading from
his new book Chasing My Tale...

03:26.033 --> 03:26.759
Tale is spelled T-A-L-E,

03:26.759 --> 03:28.132
not like the thing on my butt.

03:28.132 --> 03:32.528
...please welcome author
\h\h\h\h\hBrian Griffin.

03:32.528 --> 03:33.429
(applause)

03:33.429 --> 03:35.363
Thank you so much for being here

03:35.363 --> 03:37.462
to celebrate my book
\h\hbeing published.

03:37.462 --> 03:40.066
\h\h\h-Self-published.
-Why are you even here?

03:40.066 --> 03:42.429
\hJust a hunch.
Please proceed.

03:42.429 --> 03:44.330
(clears throat)

03:44.330 --> 03:46.033
"My mother was a huge bitch,

03:46.033 --> 03:48.264
"and I lost my virginity
\h\h\hat six months old.

03:48.264 --> 03:51.297
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h"Oh, I’m sorry,
I should have told you first,

03:51.297 --> 03:52.099
"I’m a dog.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.264
"So I turned to Fran Lebowitz
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hand said,

03:54.264 --> 03:56.231
"’I may have been born
\h\h\h\h\hin a litter,

03:56.231 --> 03:58.363
"but I’m definitely not trash.’

03:58.363 --> 04:00.561
"Then she put on my jeans
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hand left.

04:00.561 --> 04:03.297
"And so, as the sweet
\h\h\h\hmango flavor

04:03.297 --> 04:05.594
"hit my lungs for the last time,

04:05.594 --> 04:09.198
\h"I placed the vape pen
on Nelson Mandela’s grave

04:09.198 --> 04:11.561
"and knew that we were both now,

04:11.561 --> 04:14.660
"in a sense, finally free.

04:14.660 --> 04:20.429
\h\h\hThe beginning."
Thank you. Thank you.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.693
God, that took forever.

04:23.693 --> 04:25.759
I know. I gotta go.

04:25.759 --> 04:29.099
\h\hThe twins have
a volleyball game.

04:30.462 --> 04:32.066
-There you go, Seamus.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Thanks.

04:32.066 --> 04:35.000
I’ll put it right on my shelf.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.165
Hey, thanks so much
for coming, Stewie.

04:37.165 --> 04:38.165
\hOf course.
What a night.

04:38.165 --> 04:41.000
I mean, most authors wouldn’t
\h\hhave read the whole book.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
\h\h\h\h\hI just felt it
from the crowd, you know?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.561
Anyway, it means everything
\h\h\h\h\hto have you here,

04:45.561 --> 04:47.165
so thanks again.

04:47.165 --> 04:50.000
\hOh, another hand
for Brian Griffin.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.495
And if the eight of you could
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hsomehow buy

04:51.495 --> 04:53.594
a quarter of a million dollars
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hworth of books,

04:53.594 --> 04:57.330
tomorrow I won’t have to marry
\h\h\h\ha man I’ve never loved.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.363
Thank you.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.726
Excuse me, could you please
\h\h\h\h\hdirect me to the

05:03.726 --> 05:05.429
"about to die" section?

05:05.429 --> 05:06.561
Sure, right this way.

05:06.561 --> 05:09.594
We have this snake who’s tying
\h\h\h\h\hhimself into a noose,

05:09.594 --> 05:11.693
-this near-death gerbil...
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-BRUCE: Dibs!

05:11.693 --> 05:14.429
\h\hAnd I’ll take his
cardboard tube, too.

05:14.429 --> 05:15.594
I snoozed and I lost.

05:15.594 --> 05:18.000
\h\h\h\h\hYou’ve heard of
a Japanese fighting fish?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.495
\h\hThis is a Japanese
honorable suicide fish.

05:20.495 --> 05:23.627
He got fired eight months ago
\hand hasn’t told his family.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.660
He spends all day in a suit
\h\h\h\h\hriding the train.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.627
Too much backstory.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.165
We also have a very old parrot.

05:29.165 --> 05:31.429
-Or you can kill my mother
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfor money.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-What?

05:31.429 --> 05:33.000
\h\hI said we have
a very old parrot.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.396
Why, did you hear something else
you’d be open to?

05:35.396 --> 05:37.462
Family, may I kindly
\h\h\h\hintroduce you

05:37.462 --> 05:40.594
\h\h\h\h\hto our ticket to
six weeks bereavement leave

05:40.594 --> 05:42.627
in lovely Puerto Vallarta:

05:42.627 --> 05:44.264
an 80-year-old parrot.

05:44.264 --> 05:47.033
\h\h\h\h\hI call him Gonzo,
’cause of The Muppet Show.

05:47.033 --> 05:49.132
And also ’cause soon, he gone!

05:49.132 --> 05:52.033
Peter, I don’t want
\hsome elderly bird

05:52.033 --> 05:53.297
crapping all over the house.

05:53.297 --> 05:54.726
Fine. If I can’t have
\h\h\h\h\hthe parrot,

05:54.726 --> 05:58.264
\h\hyou can only have one
pink razor in the shower

05:58.264 --> 06:00.066
at a time.

06:00.066 --> 06:02.000
You can have your bird.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.528
(sniffing)

06:03.528 --> 06:07.429
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(sniffs)
Ooh, you smell that, Brian?

06:07.429 --> 06:08.462
First fire of the season.

06:08.462 --> 06:11.297
\hIt won’t be long before
the leaves start changing

06:11.297 --> 06:12.594
and the sap starts flowing.

06:12.594 --> 06:14.462
Let’s just look around
\h\h\h\h\h\hand take in

06:16.033 --> 06:18.495
the pageantry of autumn.Chris, Bonnie’s gone to bed.

06:16.033 --> 06:18.495
She’s not gonna open
\hher curtains again.

06:18.495 --> 06:20.627
Just take your dump
\h\h\hand let’s go.

06:20.627 --> 06:22.594
Hey, check it out.

06:23.099 --> 06:24.231
A little free library.

06:24.231 --> 06:27.198
\hHow white people make
giving away their trash

06:27.198 --> 06:30.198
seem like generosity.

06:31.066 --> 06:34.198
\h\h\hWhat the...
Is this my book?

06:35.660 --> 06:38.033
This is the copy
I gave to Stewie.

06:38.033 --> 06:40.363
Why, did he even bring it home?

06:40.363 --> 06:42.693
\h\hIs our friendship
worth nothing to him?

06:42.693 --> 06:44.231
I’m gonna go home
\hand give him--

06:44.231 --> 06:45.594
Oh, Bonnie opened her curtains.

06:45.594 --> 06:48.429
BONNIE (laughing):
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOoh!

06:48.429 --> 06:52.066
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Mmm.
-JOE: Sounds like somebody’s
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hhaving fun.

06:52.066 --> 06:54.198
Joe? I thought that was you.

06:54.198 --> 06:55.264
Ah, goodness no.

06:55.264 --> 06:58.660
Pass me a Michael Crichton.
\h\hShe’s gonna be a while.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.429
Does this look familiar, Stewie?

07:05.429 --> 07:07.561
It’s the culmination
\hof my life’s work,

07:07.561 --> 07:09.693
\h\h\h\h\hand it was in
the little free library

07:09.693 --> 07:11.330
being given away!

07:11.330 --> 07:13.660
What? That’s so weird, man.

07:13.660 --> 07:15.330
-So how’d it end up there?
\h\h\h\h\h\h-I don’t know.

07:15.330 --> 07:18.066
\h\h\h\hSome liberal cuck
Marie Kondo-ed his loft?

07:18.066 --> 07:19.693
Well, it’s your copy,
\h\h\hso you tell me.

07:19.693 --> 07:22.231
\hThat’s ridiculous.
My copy is right here

07:22.231 --> 07:24.033
on my book shel-- What?

07:24.033 --> 07:26.264
-Not there, huh?
\h-No, it isn’t.

07:26.264 --> 07:28.033
-This is insane.
\h\h\h-Oh, is it?

07:28.033 --> 07:31.000
\hLet me check my
security footage.

07:31.165 --> 07:33.198
\h\h\h\h\hCrazy, man.
The footage is gone.

07:33.198 --> 07:34.528
How did you even know
\h\h\hwhen to check?

07:34.528 --> 07:36.561
I didn’t tell you
when I found it.

07:36.561 --> 07:38.099
All the footage is gone.

07:38.099 --> 07:39.297
Somebody must have blown a jammy

07:39.297 --> 07:42.165
\h\h\h\h\hdown at central
and fried the whole grid.

07:42.165 --> 07:43.000
Total zapparino.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.363
Just admit you got rid
\h\h\h\h\h\hof my book.

07:44.363 --> 07:47.429
Brian, not only did I not
\h\hgive away your book,

07:47.429 --> 07:48.693
I’m launching an investigation,

07:48.693 --> 07:51.330
-and I’m gonna nail
the guy who did it.
\h\h\h\h\h-Uh-huh.

07:51.330 --> 07:53.264
And maybe it’s more
\h\h\hthan one guy.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.297
Maybe it’s a ring.

07:54.297 --> 07:56.231
A deep ring I can only penetrate

07:56.231 --> 07:57.495
by nailing a bunch of guys.

07:57.495 --> 07:59.363
Wait, are you still talking
\h\h\h\h\h\habout my book?

07:59.363 --> 08:01.660
Oh, yeah. Maybe it’s
too many guys for me

08:01.660 --> 08:03.627
and I have to bring in
\h\h\h\ha private dick.

08:03.627 --> 08:05.396
\h\h\h\hClose the door
on your way out, Brian.

08:05.396 --> 08:09.165
I need privacy to think
\habout dicks for hire.

08:13.495 --> 08:16.297
Thanks, Jerome, but I got this.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.000
-Awesome.
\h-Whoa!
-So cool.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.561
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYeah, you know,
I only bought Gonzo just to die

08:22.561 --> 08:23.363
and go on vacation,

08:23.363 --> 08:25.462
\hbut now we’re having
the time of our lives.

08:25.462 --> 08:26.627
He’s like the son I never had.

08:26.627 --> 08:31.495
(whistles) Und du bist wie mein
dicker vater! (squawks)

08:31.495 --> 08:32.561
His language is so weird.

08:32.561 --> 08:35.462
It sounds like anger,
\hrepressed sexuality

08:35.462 --> 08:37.264
and a pig being shot
\h\h\hby a paintball.

08:37.264 --> 08:39.264
-Peter, that’s German.
\h\h\h-How do you know?

08:39.264 --> 08:41.726
\h\h\h\h\h\hI speak German.
I went on an exchange trip

08:41.726 --> 08:43.693
\h\hin high school,
and for some reason

08:43.693 --> 08:45.594
my parents never bought
\h\h\hthe airfare back.

08:45.594 --> 08:47.429
Cool. We can communicate
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hwith him.

08:47.429 --> 08:49.528
Joe, ask Gonzo where he’s from.

08:49.528 --> 08:50.693
Gonzo, woher kommst du?

08:50.693 --> 08:55.165
(whistles) Ich wurde 1942
\hin Düsseldorf geboren.

08:55.165 --> 08:59.561
\h\hMein besitzer hieß
Adolf Hitler. (squawks)

08:59.561 --> 09:00.594
I heard 1942.

09:00.594 --> 09:03.594
Peter, he just said his owner
\h\h\h\h\h\hwas Adolf Hitler.

09:03.594 --> 09:06.495
-Well, that can’t be right.
\h\h-Hitler had a what now?

09:06.495 --> 09:08.429
Look, it’s him.

09:13.660 --> 09:15.099
(whistles) Das bin ich.

09:15.099 --> 09:17.231
Icherinneremich daran.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(squawks)

09:17.231 --> 09:20.033
He said, "That’s me.
\h\hI remember that."

09:20.033 --> 09:22.330
Peter, your bird is a Nazi.

09:22.330 --> 09:23.660
That can’t be right.

09:23.660 --> 09:25.726
Uh, Nazi want a cracker?

09:25.726 --> 09:28.264
Nazi want a cracker.
\h\h\h\h\h\h(squawks)

09:28.264 --> 09:29.429
Oh, my God, you’re right.

09:29.429 --> 09:30.759
\h\h\hWow, good thing
you know German, Joe.

09:30.759 --> 09:33.099
Yeah, and just so you know,
\h\hthe German culture has

09:33.099 --> 09:36.330
\hvery different notions of
what’s cool to do sexually.

09:36.330 --> 09:40.033
So whatever happened over there
was completely normal,

09:40.033 --> 09:44.561
and I don’t think about it
\h\h\hduring quiet moments.

09:45.231 --> 09:47.561
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Joe?
-Nein caca! Nein!

09:47.561 --> 09:50.462
Ich no möcshte caca!

09:50.462 --> 09:55.066
I mean, uh, crazy about
\hPeter’s bird, right?

09:57.330 --> 09:58.330
BRIAN:
Stewie!

09:58.330 --> 10:01.264
-I know you gave my book away.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-What is this?

10:01.264 --> 10:04.594
Everyone on our street
\h\hhas a ring camera.

10:08.627 --> 10:11.231
\h\hHello, I’m back.
You guys were right.

10:11.231 --> 10:13.330
\hMurdering strangers
is better than paying

10:13.330 --> 10:14.396
my credit card bill.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.462
Okay, fine, Brian,
\h\hyou caught me.

10:16.462 --> 10:18.528
I got rid of the book
you forced me to take

10:21.297 --> 10:25.693
\h\h\h\hafter you badgered me
into coming to your reading.Well, what the hell, Stewie?!

10:21.297 --> 10:25.693
I sat through your reading,
\h\hI said congratulations,

10:25.693 --> 10:26.660
I took the book.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.330
Where do my obligations end?

10:28.330 --> 10:31.099
\h\h\h\h\h\hObligations?
Are you so narcissistic,

10:33.363 --> 10:37.462
\hyou can’t do one
small thing for me?I’m narcissistic?

10:33.363 --> 10:37.462
\h\h\h\hYou’re the one who leaves
your book on display in my room.

10:37.462 --> 10:40.132
Oh, sorry it’s such a chore
\h\h\h\h\hto literally just

10:40.132 --> 10:41.495
keep a book on a book shelf.

10:41.495 --> 10:44.033
Okay, all right, even though
\h\h\h\hI only have e-books,

10:44.033 --> 10:49.132
\h\hhere’s your stupid book
on a shelf like it’s 1958.

10:49.132 --> 10:51.297
Did you even read
the inscription?

10:51.297 --> 10:53.429
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Yes.
-Well, then, what did it say?

10:53.429 --> 10:56.330
"From one hardbody to another."

10:56.330 --> 11:00.561
"To every author’s dream reader
and a true kindred spirit.

11:00.561 --> 11:03.528
\h"You lit the flame
that ignited my soul.

11:03.528 --> 11:05.594
"My best friend, my inspiration,

11:05.594 --> 11:08.330
"and the only person
\hwho truly gets me.

11:08.330 --> 11:13.198
I owe you everything.
\hB. Edward Griffin."

11:16.033 --> 11:18.594
Your initials are BEG?

11:20.066 --> 11:23.099
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOh, hey, Lois,
I just remembered that thing

11:23.099 --> 11:24.396
I wanted to tell you before.

11:24.396 --> 11:26.627
Um, you ever heard of
\h\h\h\hAdolf Hitler?

11:26.627 --> 11:29.396
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Yes.
-Well, fun trivia.

11:29.396 --> 11:31.759
Gonzo was Adolf Hitler’s bird.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.066
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWhat?
Peter, if you knew that,

11:34.066 --> 11:35.330
why the hell did you
\h\h\hbring that bird

11:35.330 --> 11:38.561
to Meg’s performance
\hof Sound of Music?

11:40.231 --> 11:42.693
\hSie sind hinter
dem großen Stein.

11:42.693 --> 11:43.759
(squawks) Nach links.

11:43.759 --> 11:48.264
He’s saying they’re behind
the big stone to the left!

11:48.495 --> 11:53.132
\h\h\h(whistles) Meine linke,
nicht Bühne linke! (squawks)

11:53.132 --> 11:57.033
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHe’s saying,
"My left, not stage left"!

11:57.561 --> 11:59.594
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hCARTER:
You’re getting warmer.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.099
What? The parents started it.

12:02.099 --> 12:03.066
It’s not his fault, Lois.

12:03.066 --> 12:05.264
He’s just repeating
what he was taught.

12:05.264 --> 12:05.660
By Hitler.

12:05.660 --> 12:07.759
\h\h\h\hYeah, that’s like
40% of America right now.

12:07.759 --> 12:10.099
\hPeter, if you don’t
get rid of that bird,

12:10.099 --> 12:12.066
I’m calling animal control.

12:12.066 --> 12:12.594
You do that

12:12.594 --> 12:14.231
-and I’ll make you pay.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-How?

12:14.231 --> 12:16.561
\hYou ever hear of
revenge porn, Lois?

12:16.561 --> 12:17.462
Peter, if you did that,

12:17.462 --> 12:19.462
then everyone would see
\h\h\h\h\h\hyour penis.

12:19.462 --> 12:21.231
I retract my threat.

12:21.231 --> 12:22.561
Please strike it
from the record.

12:22.561 --> 12:23.660
I’ll strike it if I can find it.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.297
-You have any tweezers?
-No, I don’t have any--

12:26.297 --> 12:29.099
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

12:31.132 --> 12:33.660
Look at us restoring
\h\h\ha classic car.

12:33.660 --> 12:35.660
Yep, 2004 Saturn Ion.

12:35.660 --> 12:38.429
\h\h\h\hThis baby captures
all the glory of my youth.

12:38.429 --> 12:40.528
\h\h\h\h\hShrek 2 was
the number-one movie,

12:40.528 --> 12:42.231
Dane Cook made Myspace
\h\h\hthe place to be,

12:42.231 --> 12:46.132
and LimeWire helped you bankrupt
your favorite bands.

12:46.132 --> 12:47.165
What a year.

12:47.165 --> 12:49.000
Sorry, I don’t mean
\h\h\hto interrupt.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.759
\h\hI just want to
throw out my laptop

12:50.759 --> 12:52.693
since I won’t be
writing anymore.

12:52.693 --> 12:55.495
Oh come on, Brian,
don’t be dramatic.

12:55.495 --> 12:58.198
Dramatic? Me? Pshaw!

12:58.198 --> 13:00.099
\hJust abandoning
my lifelong dream

13:00.099 --> 13:02.132
since even my best friend
\h\h\h\hcan’t support me.

13:02.132 --> 13:03.693
So you’re getting rid of
\h\hall your photos, too?

13:06.561 --> 13:08.330
No, I downloaded those to
\han external hard drive.How are you going

13:06.561 --> 13:08.330
-to watch movies in bed?
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-My phone.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.759
\hCouldn’t you also still write
in the notes app on your phone?

13:11.759 --> 13:12.693
I deleted that app.

13:12.693 --> 13:14.330
Okay, but couldn’t you
\h\h\h\h\h\hstill write

13:14.330 --> 13:15.198
using pen and paper?

13:15.198 --> 13:17.000
I mean, I’m sorry to keep
\h\hpushing back on this,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.462
\h\h\hit just feels like
throwing away the laptop

13:19.462 --> 13:21.231
is-is just unnecessary.

13:21.231 --> 13:23.132
You got your wish, Stewie,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI quit.

13:23.132 --> 13:25.198
You’ll never have to worry
\h\h\h\h\h\h\habout keeping

13:25.198 --> 13:26.231
one of my books again.

13:26.231 --> 13:28.462
Come on, Brian, be reasonable.

13:28.462 --> 13:30.066
That wasn’t my intention.

13:30.066 --> 13:32.033
Too bad. Goodbye, dream.

13:32.033 --> 13:33.495
Okay, last objection, I swear.

13:33.495 --> 13:35.033
But that’s actually
\h\hsupposed to go

13:35.033 --> 13:36.726
in a separate collection
\h\h\h\h\h\hfor e-waste,

13:36.726 --> 13:39.264
which is the last Friday
\h\h\h\h\hof every month.

13:39.264 --> 13:40.726
It’s fine.

13:43.726 --> 13:46.132
(beeping)

13:47.462 --> 13:49.561
Laptop! Laptop! Laptop!

13:57.594 --> 13:58.693
There he is, the genius

13:58.693 --> 14:00.165
\h\h-getting his inspo.
-(video game blipping)

14:00.165 --> 14:03.000
\h\h\h\h\h\h-What do you want?
-Look, here’s the thing, Brian.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.099
I actually did like your book.

14:05.099 --> 14:06.099
Yeah, right.

14:06.099 --> 14:06.759
\h-I did.
-Me, too.

14:06.759 --> 14:07.693
Yeah, what’d you like about it?

14:07.693 --> 14:11.528
You wrote about kibble
with a lot of passion.

14:11.528 --> 14:12.627
Uh-huh.

14:12.627 --> 14:14.231
You described a lot of trees,

14:14.231 --> 14:17.726
\hand you also let us know
which ones were steadfast,

14:17.726 --> 14:20.264
which was a surprisingly
high percentage of them.

14:20.264 --> 14:22.660
\h-(game over sound)
-Ugh! It’s pointless.

14:22.660 --> 14:24.099
I’ve given writing
\h\hmy whole life,

14:24.099 --> 14:26.627
and I can’t even get ten people
to come to a reading.

14:26.627 --> 14:28.693
Hell, I’ve been playing
this game for 20 years,

14:28.693 --> 14:30.264
and I can’t even get
\h\h\h\hto level two.

14:30.264 --> 14:33.165
Really? That game is,
\h\hlike, very easy.

14:33.165 --> 14:37.000
\h\h\h\hJust get out of here!
And leave me alone. Forever.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.594
Chris, I can see his gums.
\h\h\h\h\h\hWe’d better go.

14:39.594 --> 14:42.660
\h\hThis is terrible.
We have to help him.

14:42.660 --> 14:44.198
I have a great idea.

14:44.198 --> 14:46.561
\h\h\h\h\h-What is it?
-Oh, no, not for this.

14:46.561 --> 14:49.165
Netflix... for guns.

14:49.165 --> 14:54.165
Stewie, you’re gonna be
\h\h\h\ha trillionaire.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.198
Perhaps we can lift Brian
\h\h\h\h\hout of his funk

14:58.198 --> 15:01.627
if we get his book on The New
York Times Best Seller list.

15:01.627 --> 15:03.297
It would only take 1,500 copies.

15:03.297 --> 15:05.363
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-That’s it?
-Yes. And a lot of celebrities

15:05.363 --> 15:08.000
\h\hactually make the list
by buying their own books.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.066
Wait, are you telling me that
\hsome of Donald Trump Jr.’s

15:11.066 --> 15:14.000
success isn’t based
\h\hon merit alone?

15:14.000 --> 15:14.627
Yes, I am saying that.

15:14.627 --> 15:17.462
Still we can’t afford to buy
\h\h\h\h\h\hthat many copies.

15:17.462 --> 15:18.231
(computer chimes)

15:18.231 --> 15:21.000
\h\hBut Reese Witherspoon’s
manager just got back to me

15:21.000 --> 15:22.066
about her book club.

15:22.066 --> 15:23.099
Stewie, this could be huge.

15:23.099 --> 15:25.462
Every alcoholic housewife
\h\h\h\h\hin this country

15:25.462 --> 15:27.363
\h\h\h\h\hdoes whatever
Reese Witherspoon says.

15:27.363 --> 15:31.495
"Unfortunately, Reese’s only
\h\h\hinterests are crawdads

15:34.627 --> 15:37.627
\h\h\h\h"and long hikes,
so she’s happily passing.No regrets."

15:34.627 --> 15:37.627
Now I’m glad her husband
Jim Toth failed at Quibi,

15:37.627 --> 15:40.561
\h\h\h\h\hreportedly straining
their Hollywood super-marriage.

15:40.561 --> 15:42.594
Oh, don’t be nasty, Chris.

15:42.594 --> 15:44.495
-Okay, plan C.
\h-What’s that?

15:44.495 --> 15:47.660
Use Lois’s account to buy
\hthree copies on Amazon.

15:47.660 --> 15:50.132
\h\h\h\hThat’ll get Brian
in the top 20 of Amazon’s

15:50.132 --> 15:54.726
\h\h\h"Canine Nonfiction
Under 60 Pages" category.

15:54.726 --> 15:56.132
\h\h\h\h\hOh, great.
All you have to do is

15:56.132 --> 15:58.000
click which of these
\h\h\hare crosswalks

15:58.000 --> 15:59.429
to prove you’re not a robot.

15:59.429 --> 16:02.429
Well, uh... you do it.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.726
Come on, Chris, you...

16:03.726 --> 16:06.165
you’re not actually
\ha robot, are you?

16:06.165 --> 16:09.000
\h\h\h(robot voice):
Identity compromised.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.297
Abort mission.

16:11.297 --> 16:12.726
\h\h(robot voice):
Greetings, sibling.

16:12.726 --> 16:16.000
\h\h\h\hI am Chris 2.0
with crosswalk update.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.132
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOh, phew.
Okay, well, it’s refreshed,

16:18.132 --> 16:20.693
\hand now it needs you
to identify stop signs.

16:20.693 --> 16:23.198
If you will excuse me.

16:27.297 --> 16:30.099
So, what do you want to watch,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNazi bird?

16:30.099 --> 16:32.330
Fox. (squawks)

16:34.759 --> 16:37.363
Quick, Gonzo, we gotta go.

16:41.363 --> 16:43.561
Rabbi Goldstein, Peter Griffin.

16:43.561 --> 16:45.594
I’m sorry, am I bothering you?

16:45.594 --> 16:47.033
No, it’s fine.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.231
I’m just practicing circumcision

16:50.759 --> 16:54.066
on a kosher hot dog.How can I help you?

16:50.759 --> 16:54.066
I bought this parrot used,
\h\h\h\h\hand it turns out

16:54.066 --> 16:55.726
he’s Adolf Hitler’s old pet.

16:58.396 --> 17:00.495
And what do you want from me?Well, the word is out,

16:58.396 --> 17:00.495
and a bunch of people
\h\hwant to kill him.

17:00.495 --> 17:03.759
And I was thinking maybe
\hif you said he’s okay,

17:03.759 --> 17:05.231
maybe they’d back off.

17:05.231 --> 17:07.561
To seek vengeance or to forgive.

17:07.561 --> 17:11.396
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSuch a dilemma.
Let us see what it says in...

17:11.396 --> 17:12.528
(squawks) Torah.

17:12.528 --> 17:13.759
Torah? What’s that?

17:13.759 --> 17:15.231
Our sacred scrolls.

17:15.231 --> 17:18.462
Oh, I thought those was
\h\h\hrolls of Brawny.

17:19.429 --> 17:23.363
Bar’chu et Adonai hamvorach.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(squawks)

17:23.363 --> 17:25.429
My friend, your bird is Jewish.

17:25.429 --> 17:29.693
He only pretended to be a Nazi
\h\h\h\h\h\hto survive the war.

17:29.693 --> 17:30.528
Gonzo’s Jewish?

17:30.528 --> 17:33.693
Peter, you have done
\ha wonderful thing.

17:33.693 --> 17:37.231
We must celebrate
with some matzah.

17:37.231 --> 17:40.396
As we say, L’Chaim!
\h\h\h\h\hTo life.

17:40.396 --> 17:43.033
-L’Chaim!
-L’Chaim!

17:43.759 --> 17:45.132
Pretty dry.

17:45.132 --> 17:48.429
(choking)

17:48.429 --> 17:51.033
(squawks)

17:52.297 --> 17:55.561
I think Gonzo lost his Chaim.

18:00.528 --> 18:04.099
Whoa, look at you, Brian.
\h\h\hBack in the saddle?

18:04.099 --> 18:06.033
\h\hWell, it’s like
Ray Bradbury said:

18:06.033 --> 18:07.759
\h\h\h"You only fail
if you stop writing."

18:07.759 --> 18:10.693
That’s a really healthy attitude
for someone who just failed.

18:10.693 --> 18:14.165
\h\hWell, it turns out my book
actually did find an audience.

18:14.165 --> 18:16.330
Right now, it’s number nine
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hon Amazon’s

18:16.330 --> 18:18.165
"Mangy Mammal Memoirs" list.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.231
LOIS: Who the hell used
\h\h\hmy Amazon account

18:20.231 --> 18:23.627
to order three copies
\h\hof Brian’s book?!

18:25.495 --> 18:28.627
(growling)Oh, boy.

18:25.495 --> 18:28.627
Great. So now after
having insulted me,

18:28.627 --> 18:30.132
you’ve deceived me.

18:30.132 --> 18:31.396
Thanks so much, pal.

18:31.396 --> 18:32.198
Why do you even care?

18:32.198 --> 18:35.198
\h\hYou’re the one who said you
don’t need external validation.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.264
Of course that was a lie.

18:36.264 --> 18:38.528
\h\h\hAll I care about
is external validation.

18:42.231 --> 18:44.231
I’m a dog. "Good boy" is
literally the best thingyou can say to me.

18:42.231 --> 18:44.231
\hAnd the fact that
even my best friend

18:44.231 --> 18:47.495
\h\hdoesn’t want a free copy
of my book is-is devastating.

18:47.495 --> 18:49.660
Don’t you talk to me
\habout devastating.

18:49.660 --> 18:51.726
\h\h-What do you mean?
-Don’t you understand?

18:51.726 --> 18:54.363
Brian, I only got rid
\h\h\h\h\hof the book

18:54.363 --> 18:56.198
because I was jealous of you.

18:56.198 --> 18:57.198
Jealous? Why?

18:57.198 --> 19:00.528
\h\h\hBecause you set out to
do something, and you did it.

19:00.528 --> 19:02.033
Unlike me and my goals.

19:02.033 --> 19:05.198
\h\h\hEvery time I walked by
your book, it was a reminder

19:05.198 --> 19:07.198
of all that I haven’t
\h\h\h\haccomplished.

19:07.198 --> 19:09.033
I know I’m supposed to be
\h\h\h\h\hhappy for you,

19:09.033 --> 19:11.462
but when you succeed,
\h\h\hall it does is

19:11.462 --> 19:13.528
make me feel bad about myself.

19:13.528 --> 19:16.198
And you made me feel really bad.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.528
Then I guess I really succeeded.

19:19.528 --> 19:22.000
You did. Big-time.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.429
I’m proud of you, Brian.

19:26.396 --> 19:28.693
\h\h\h-Good boy.
-Thanks, Stewie.

19:28.693 --> 19:32.000
Now, please never do
\h\h\hanything again.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.660
-Friends?
-Friends.

19:37.165 --> 19:39.693
\hStill, it’d be nice
to sell a few books,

19:39.693 --> 19:41.231
to have anyone know my name.

19:41.231 --> 19:44.462
\h\h\hMeh. You ever heard of

Mike Desilets or Gary Janetti?

19:51.198 --> 19:54.033
They’re all Family Guy writers
\h\h\h\h\hwho’ve written books,

19:54.033 --> 19:55.660
and no one’s ever heard of them.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.363
Gary Janetti kind of
\h\h\h\hrings a bell.

19:59.033 --> 20:02.198
Yeah, he’s got a popular
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hInstagram,so he kind of broke through.

19:59.033 --> 20:02.198
But the rest of them,
\ha bunch of bitter,

20:02.198 --> 20:03.363
Emmy-less losers.

20:03.363 --> 20:05.396
Has Seth MacFarlane ever
\h\h\h\h\hwritten a book?

20:05.396 --> 20:06.462
\h-Oh, yeah.
-How’d it do?

20:06.462 --> 20:09.594
A signed copy is cheaper
\h\h\h\h\hthan a new one.

20:15.165 --> 20:17.495
Thank you, everybody,
\h\hfor coming today.

20:17.495 --> 20:20.132
Chris would like to say
\h\h\h\ha couple words.
