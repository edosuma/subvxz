00:01.472 --> 00:02.606
<i> What is it?</i>

00:02.640 --> 00:04.842
- Harry's dead.
- What?

00:04.876 --> 00:06.073
<i> What did White tell you?</i>

00:06.098 --> 00:07.975
That I was the breach?
And you believed that?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.369
- You're alive, aren't you?
- What are they covering up, Said?

00:10.408 --> 00:11.742
It was made very clear to me

00:11.767 --> 00:12.982
<i>if I don't complete this job...</i>

00:13.069 --> 00:14.571
<i> White takes out your family.</i>

00:14.611 --> 00:15.879
Max is off the leash.

00:15.912 --> 00:17.872
We are going to have to flush him out.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.353
<i>And we're going to use his wife
and children to do it.</i>

00:20.378 --> 00:23.157
You harm one hair on
their heads, I swear to God...

00:23.182 --> 00:25.859
You'll what, Max? You'll... what?

00:25.943 --> 00:27.871
We found an intelligence source.

00:27.978 --> 00:29.932
<i>Ashkan Davoud, a scientist</i>

00:29.957 --> 00:32.330
<i>with detailed knowledge
of what we believe to be.</i>

00:32.363 --> 00:33.897
Tehran's reactivated program.

00:34.178 --> 00:35.513
There is no such program.

00:35.538 --> 00:37.702
Everything you're going
to say is in here.

00:37.727 --> 00:39.222
<i> Kahani walked Ardavan into an ambush.</i>

00:39.249 --> 00:41.289
<i>He's clearly no lawyer.
Maybe he's Agency.</i>

00:41.409 --> 00:43.308
- Those are?
- Put that back in your pocket.

00:43.508 --> 00:45.703
Better still, bury it
before it buries you.

00:45.728 --> 00:47.278
He's played us. It's a feint.

00:47.311 --> 00:48.476
<i>He's coming to you!</i>

00:50.080 --> 00:51.315
I'm with Max. Come on, get in.

<i>Papa, non.</i>

01:23.488 --> 01:27.641
- Papa! Papa!
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey. It's okay.

01:27.666 --> 01:29.720
- You're bleeding!
- It's okay.

01:29.754 --> 01:31.288
We need to get off the road.
We can't stay here.

01:31.321 --> 01:32.719
- Mama, get your bag!
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:32.743 --> 01:33.786
Noah.

01:35.058 --> 01:36.118
We need to get off the road.

01:36.143 --> 01:37.769
- We need to hide.
- In the car!

01:37.918 --> 01:39.529
It's all right, sweetheart.

01:39.562 --> 01:41.165
Mama!

01:41.198 --> 01:43.767
Get them in the fucking car!

01:43.800 --> 01:46.356
You're a mess. You need a doctor. Anna?

01:47.289 --> 01:50.004
Anna! Please! Now they'll be coming.

01:50.029 --> 01:51.564
They'll be after us.
We can't stay here.

01:54.633 --> 01:58.137
Jesus. He needs a hospital.

01:58.169 --> 02:00.330
No, no. No-no hospitals.
They'll find us.

02:00.364 --> 02:02.656
I need suture equipment, supplies.

02:02.696 --> 02:04.412
I'll get you what we need.
We'll find a hotel or something.

02:04.436 --> 02:05.756
Come, move! Move!

03:25.781 --> 03:28.017
<i> Natural uranium is made weapons-grade</i>

03:28.042 --> 03:29.909
through isotopic enrichment.

03:30.055 --> 03:32.444
Highly enriched uranium is
considered weapons-grade

03:32.469 --> 03:34.775
when it has been enriched to about 90%.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.117
And your role at Alin was... what?

03:37.210 --> 03:39.899
I was part of a team that
oversees the enrichment process.

03:39.931 --> 03:42.367
Mr. Davoud, the Alin plant was never

03:42.392 --> 03:45.552
on the IAEA inspection list.

03:45.632 --> 03:47.067
- No, sir.
- Why is that?

03:47.092 --> 03:49.268
Because it was
a conventional power plant.

03:49.328 --> 03:50.902
The regime has been developing

03:50.927 --> 03:53.080
the plant's weaponizing capabilities.

03:53.294 --> 03:55.240
- For how long?
- Five years.

03:55.307 --> 03:58.250
All the way through the
time the regime was negotiating

03:58.275 --> 04:00.191
the P5+1 deal?

04:00.224 --> 04:01.494
Yes, sir.

04:01.598 --> 04:05.252
Mr. Davoud, how close
is the Iranian regime

04:05.277 --> 04:08.799
to developing a viable nuclear weapon?

04:09.127 --> 04:13.908
- It's hard to tell.
- So make an educated guess.

04:15.305 --> 04:17.613
Six months. A year at most.

04:17.661 --> 04:20.305
- Jesus H Christ.
- The senator will yield.

04:20.331 --> 04:22.972
Richard, can we dispense with
the fucking protocols, please?

04:22.997 --> 04:24.916
We have just wandered into a nightmare.

04:24.941 --> 04:28.833
Mr. Davoud, sorry for not being
ready to take you at your word.

04:28.858 --> 04:32.345
What evidence would you have
to back up your claim?

04:43.687 --> 04:46.203
Hi. Nicola Thirlby
for Oliver Stirling Incorporate.

04:46.237 --> 04:47.560
Okay.

04:53.116 --> 04:54.527
They're going to want verification.

04:54.552 --> 04:56.788
There's no silver bullet.

04:56.813 --> 04:59.217
So, intelligence that helps them
complete the picture:

04:59.242 --> 05:00.911
soil samples, air, water.

05:01.454 --> 05:04.408
Proof that the facility is active.

05:04.573 --> 05:07.477
- This came from Burrell?
- Yeah.

05:08.045 --> 05:10.422
This is never going to happen
with him in the chair.

05:10.855 --> 05:12.890
He's the architect of the detente.

05:12.976 --> 05:14.812
Doesn't want to believe he's failed.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.802
- So?
- So, we need someone more fired up.

05:18.391 --> 05:21.705
Someone who'll scare the shit
out of the president.

05:24.182 --> 05:27.011
We're the ones
who put Hawes in the wings.

05:27.110 --> 05:28.780
It's time to clear the stage for him.

05:29.044 --> 05:30.281
What's the approach?

05:31.198 --> 05:32.382
Flattery.

05:32.705 --> 05:34.686
Same as any politician.

05:36.839 --> 05:38.953
Make them think they're right.

05:39.463 --> 05:41.956
<i> The problem is
a total lack of understanding</i>

05:41.981 --> 05:43.135
<i>of the Arab mentality.</i>

05:43.198 --> 05:46.169
<i>Any hand of friendship is
a hopelessly futile gesture.</i>

05:46.330 --> 05:47.732
<i>They understand strength.</i>

05:47.845 --> 05:50.309
<i>You hurt them, and they respond.</i>

06:01.578 --> 06:03.502
You see anything?

06:04.280 --> 06:05.746
No.

06:08.365 --> 06:09.734
But I know they'll be coming.

06:10.850 --> 06:12.902
Right. What would you do?
If you were White?

06:12.936 --> 06:16.306
Will you both please just stop talking?

06:16.427 --> 06:19.070
Anna? Anna?

06:19.095 --> 06:22.976
Just... let me be your doctor.

06:24.167 --> 06:26.000
<i> Attend, attend, attend.</i>

06:26.050 --> 06:28.400
- Stop! You're hurting him!
- I'm taking the girls outside.

06:28.425 --> 06:30.336
- That's not a good idea.
- They are distressed.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.436
Look, we don't know
who's out there. Just...

06:32.850 --> 06:35.470
You... You take your hands off me.

06:39.712 --> 06:41.251
Who the hell are you anyway?

06:41.488 --> 06:43.087
He's my son.

06:46.154 --> 06:47.758
Harry's my son.

07:19.575 --> 07:21.176
<i>I got a lead on Kahani.</i>

07:21.302 --> 07:23.438
Yeah? Tell me.

07:23.463 --> 07:26.233
Some sort of law firm. District 6.

07:26.296 --> 07:28.565
Okay. That's Tehran.
You can't go back to Tehran.

07:28.632 --> 07:29.934
Okay, listen to me, Harry.

07:29.965 --> 07:31.338
<i>I've got to find out what he knows</i>

07:31.363 --> 07:32.544
<i>about that drone strike.</i>

07:32.569 --> 07:34.104
There's no one there anymore, Leyla.

07:34.143 --> 07:35.473
You'll have no contacts, no network.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.191
You'll be completely on your own.

07:37.876 --> 07:39.869
Okay, look, I've got to go, but just...

07:40.643 --> 07:42.366
Just don't do anything, okay?
Sit tight.

07:42.516 --> 07:45.887
Okay. I'll sit tight.

07:52.728 --> 07:54.197
You all right?

07:54.401 --> 07:57.751
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- So what now?

08:03.118 --> 08:04.686
I sent it to White.

08:05.706 --> 08:07.566
You did what?

08:08.177 --> 08:09.470
Why?

08:09.778 --> 08:11.931
He's gonna find out soon enough.

08:13.228 --> 08:14.618
Now he knows we're coming for him.

08:14.919 --> 08:17.025
You want to go <i> to</i> White?

08:17.621 --> 08:19.623
That's insane. This is insane.

08:19.724 --> 08:22.626
He's got all the answers, Harry.

08:23.068 --> 08:25.295
If you want to get out from under this,

08:25.576 --> 08:27.564
this is the way we have to do it.

08:27.933 --> 08:29.833
How the fuck do we get to him?

08:31.009 --> 08:32.335
Through his weak spot.

08:32.768 --> 08:34.283
Which is?

08:38.741 --> 08:40.280
His children.

08:42.571 --> 08:44.732
Passport alerts on all borders.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.327
Surveillance of all his contacts.

08:50.198 --> 08:52.267
The moment he surfaces...

08:56.919 --> 08:58.074
Sir?

08:58.134 --> 09:00.137
He's coming here.

09:02.151 --> 09:03.613
For me.

09:04.472 --> 09:06.459
We'll step up security.

09:08.019 --> 09:09.926
I threatened his family.

09:11.026 --> 09:12.546
Me.

09:13.974 --> 09:15.643
I threatened his children.

09:18.851 --> 09:21.950
Two little girls playing house,
and I pulled a gun on them.

09:24.238 --> 09:25.541
Do you think that's crossing the line?

09:26.543 --> 09:27.557
Well, sir, I...

09:27.582 --> 09:28.823
It's difficult to avoid crossing it

09:28.848 --> 09:31.385
when they keep moving
the fucker around.

09:34.609 --> 09:36.661
Put a tail on the ex-wife.

09:37.012 --> 09:39.214
And I want my family protected.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.813
I don't want that bastard within
a hundred miles of this place.

09:47.908 --> 09:49.819
S-Sir, what about Jones?

09:50.494 --> 09:51.567
If we brief her...

09:51.592 --> 09:52.755
You really think
they respect us, Elliot?

09:52.779 --> 09:54.481
You really think they give a shit?

09:55.361 --> 09:56.875
They use us, and they fuck us,

09:56.900 --> 09:59.471
and that is the extent
of the special relationship.

10:02.155 --> 10:04.202
We don't go crying to Washington.

11:07.247 --> 11:09.060
What are you doing out here?

11:09.284 --> 11:11.780
We need to wake the girls, we...

11:13.407 --> 11:15.577
We have to get going,
it's safer in the dark.

11:20.127 --> 11:21.396
Anna.

11:24.345 --> 11:25.779
I'm so sorry.

11:26.266 --> 11:27.935
For what?

11:33.153 --> 11:35.423
What part are you sorry for?

11:38.346 --> 11:39.981
For lying to me

11:40.180 --> 11:41.863
for ten years?

11:43.958 --> 11:46.026
For lying to our daughters?

11:47.655 --> 11:49.814
For putting our lives in danger?

11:52.905 --> 11:54.471
For who you are?

11:58.072 --> 12:00.240
For this whole fucking mess?

12:04.438 --> 12:06.274
What part are you sorry for?

12:07.307 --> 12:09.031
I'd really love to know.

12:19.414 --> 12:21.417
We're not coming with you.

12:23.478 --> 12:25.573
I don't think that's a good idea.

12:26.967 --> 12:28.140
Yeah...

12:28.736 --> 12:31.131
Well, I don't really care
about what you think anymore.

12:31.350 --> 12:32.968
When this is over,

12:33.700 --> 12:35.874
when we're safe, if you don't
ever want to see me again,

12:35.899 --> 12:38.235
I-I completely understand.

12:39.616 --> 12:41.376
But until then,

12:41.562 --> 12:46.301
I'm not letting you or the girls...
out of my sight.

13:08.668 --> 13:10.499
Hey, sweetheart.

13:11.487 --> 13:13.655
Come on, it's time to wake up.

13:56.797 --> 14:00.567
Mmm. Mmm.

14:18.012 --> 14:21.959
- How old are you?
- 28.

14:23.265 --> 14:24.878
Who's your mum?

14:25.694 --> 14:27.499
She's called Olivia. She's a...

14:28.203 --> 14:29.972
She's a nice lady, you'd like her.

14:31.694 --> 14:33.449
He never mentioned you.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.644
Yeah, well, maybe he thought
it might upset you.

14:39.339 --> 14:40.967
Isn't that weird for you?

14:41.596 --> 14:43.331
That he doesn't talk about you.

14:44.632 --> 14:46.399
Hey, sweetheart.

14:46.593 --> 14:49.129
- Do you want to go and sit with Mummy?
- Yeah.

14:51.804 --> 14:53.773
He says he'll take us.

14:53.986 --> 14:55.209
Right.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.978
We're all set.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.584
- Senator.
- Sorry.

15:08.628 --> 15:11.088
- I'm in a hurry.
- If I could have just a second?

15:11.217 --> 15:12.394
We're not permitted

15:12.419 --> 15:13.872
to discuss the briefings.

15:13.941 --> 15:16.291
This is not about the briefing.

15:22.632 --> 15:26.054
How has it taken me so long
to notice you, Miss Jones?

15:26.438 --> 15:28.456
$500 suit

15:28.739 --> 15:31.293
and that persuasive perfume...

15:31.594 --> 15:32.934
The scent of ambition.

15:32.959 --> 15:34.695
You don't trust ambition, Senator?

15:34.917 --> 15:37.146
I'll tell you what I don't trust.

15:37.873 --> 15:41.876
I don't trust the waves
of eager, young CIA operatives.

15:41.943 --> 15:45.213
They come waltzing in here,
drooling for a promotion.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.367
So keen to climb the ladder

15:47.392 --> 15:48.832
- that things get missed.
- Senator, I...

15:48.857 --> 15:50.717
I have been singing this same damn tune

15:50.742 --> 15:52.647
for the last 25 years.

15:53.259 --> 15:55.211
No one at the Agency's been listening.

15:55.315 --> 15:56.938
Well, Senator,
we're listening to you now.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.497
Chairman Burrell...

15:58.607 --> 16:00.830
Burrell has got his hands

16:00.855 --> 16:03.191
wrapped tightly
around everyone's balls.

16:03.270 --> 16:05.307
He's staked his reputation
on Iran's compliance.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.708
He's not the right person
to run the directorate now.

16:09.416 --> 16:12.345
If someone were to challenge him...

16:15.098 --> 16:18.433
I'm saying my people
would support that bid.

16:21.686 --> 16:23.812
You said this was not
about the briefing.

16:23.870 --> 16:25.394
And you said you didn't trust ambition,

16:25.419 --> 16:27.789
but you haven't walked away yet.

16:32.566 --> 16:34.890
The circumstances aren't right.

16:36.786 --> 16:38.860
I think I can help with that.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.835
Kelly... I've got a story for you.

16:49.938 --> 16:51.456
It's about Iran.

16:53.233 --> 16:55.302
A leak from within the directorate.

17:01.434 --> 17:03.960
I think you'll find
the circumstances just changed.

17:21.836 --> 17:24.373
- Usual, please, Pete.
- Right, sure.

17:49.596 --> 17:51.199
Thank you.

18:20.627 --> 18:21.829
Shit.

18:22.127 --> 18:23.365
Shit!

20:01.414 --> 20:03.330
Come on, then.

20:03.931 --> 20:06.101
- Daddy, can I jump?
- Course you can.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.515
Where are we?

20:16.543 --> 20:17.621
We're somewhere safe.

20:17.646 --> 20:19.181
Max, we've been told that before.

20:19.206 --> 20:21.543
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Noah.

20:49.328 --> 20:50.645
Hey.

20:52.733 --> 20:55.136
- So, did you want this room?
- No, I'm fine.

20:56.703 --> 20:58.203
Right.

21:04.144 --> 21:05.747
What's in the bag?

21:07.161 --> 21:10.052
It's just things I need. Work.

21:10.749 --> 21:13.553
- You work with Dad?
- Yeah, for the moment.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.419
He left you, didn't he?

21:20.967 --> 21:22.429
Why'd he leave you?

21:26.596 --> 21:28.615
Sometimes people need to leave.

21:29.281 --> 21:30.828
You should hate him.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.700
What's gonna happen to us?

21:39.705 --> 21:41.301
I don't know.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.406
But I do know it's gonna be okay.

21:43.459 --> 21:44.546
I promise.

21:44.571 --> 21:45.940
Your dad's gonna fix this.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.834
It's what he does.

22:00.567 --> 22:02.453
<i>You said you'd sit tight.</i>

22:03.487 --> 22:06.453
Well, what can I say?

22:06.668 --> 22:08.737
I'm not good at being told what to do.

22:09.457 --> 22:11.693
Been that way since school.

22:11.877 --> 22:14.149
<i>I'm running surveillance
on Kahani's office.</i>

22:14.529 --> 22:15.697
Looks military.

22:15.722 --> 22:17.291
Yeah, you need to be careful.

22:17.318 --> 22:18.787
Harry, don't...

22:19.478 --> 22:20.772
don't nursemaid me.

22:20.820 --> 22:22.424
Everyone he's come into contact with,

22:22.449 --> 22:23.937
they're all dead.

22:24.337 --> 22:25.805
Right, Kahani's burning his trail.

22:25.873 --> 22:27.275
<i>Exactly.</i>

22:27.375 --> 22:29.210
<i>That's why we need to talk to him.</i>

22:29.598 --> 22:30.905
<i>Where are you?</i>

22:30.950 --> 22:32.575
I'm in our old flat.

22:34.132 --> 22:35.951
It's weird without you here.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.310
You knew to come here.

23:09.983 --> 23:11.586
You're so smart, Liv.

23:11.736 --> 23:13.237
You said if they ever came after me,

23:13.300 --> 23:14.869
this was the safest place, so...

23:40.076 --> 23:42.342
You didn't think to tell me
he was alive?

23:42.433 --> 23:44.167
I couldn't risk it.

23:44.733 --> 23:45.796
Phones, e-mails...

23:45.821 --> 23:47.186
It's not safe.

23:50.991 --> 23:52.683
I thought I'd lost you.

23:53.128 --> 23:54.285
Look, I'm fine.

23:55.148 --> 23:56.253
Okay? I'm right here.

24:01.372 --> 24:02.874
Papa?

24:11.147 --> 24:14.773
Anna, this is Olivia.

24:16.380 --> 24:19.454
Olivia, this is Anna, Chloe and Lola.

24:30.507 --> 24:31.723
It's fine.

24:32.654 --> 24:34.067
Everything's gonna be fine.

24:34.162 --> 24:35.910
And how would you feel
if you were six years old

24:35.934 --> 24:38.688
and you had to be escorted
by men with guns?

24:38.811 --> 24:40.415
He thinks it's fun.

24:41.628 --> 24:44.009
He doesn't understand the implications.

24:45.232 --> 24:46.701
What happened, George?

24:46.779 --> 24:49.282
- I mean, are you e-ever gonna tell me?
- Ray...

24:49.423 --> 24:53.047
This man, I-if he's threatening
our children,

24:53.607 --> 24:54.762
I-I want to understand.

24:54.794 --> 24:55.835
We had an agreement.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.429
Oh, sod our agreement.

24:57.711 --> 24:59.463
We've never had our kids
in the firing line before.

24:59.488 --> 25:01.491
I mean, what's going on?

25:09.070 --> 25:10.897
We were made to feel like soldiers.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.199
"We"?

25:12.572 --> 25:14.037
Who's "we"?

25:17.097 --> 25:19.195
When we were first recruited.

25:24.157 --> 25:26.360
Made to feel righteous.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.569
That everything that we did

25:31.177 --> 25:32.666
was right.

25:34.948 --> 25:36.750
What did you do, George?

25:40.267 --> 25:41.669
What did you do?

25:43.991 --> 25:45.774
I went after his family.

25:52.386 --> 25:54.170
I went after his children.

25:55.130 --> 25:56.667
Oh...

26:06.907 --> 26:08.747
Can't we just stay here?

26:10.350 --> 26:12.411
Let the rest of the world do its thing?

26:13.520 --> 26:15.001
Yeah, we could.

26:15.613 --> 26:16.759
But?

26:16.784 --> 26:19.341
But you know it doesn't work like that.

26:19.906 --> 26:21.783
We don't get to just walk away.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.502
Your dad did.

26:26.519 --> 26:27.821
Or at least, he tried to.

26:27.846 --> 26:29.732
Yeah, well, look where that got him.

26:31.772 --> 26:33.527
He's right back here with us.

26:35.778 --> 26:38.453
On the bright side,
I always wanted sisters, so...

27:00.446 --> 27:02.053
Did you miss him?

27:04.589 --> 27:06.512
Of course. Every day.

27:09.283 --> 27:11.008
Yet you did nothing about it.

27:12.346 --> 27:14.223
Never tried to contact him.

27:15.762 --> 27:17.366
Not once?

27:18.985 --> 27:20.253
No.

27:24.104 --> 27:25.928
I don't understand.

27:27.895 --> 27:29.673
I thought I could block it out,

27:30.703 --> 27:32.244
start again.

27:34.768 --> 27:36.923
There is no starting again
in this life.

27:38.985 --> 27:40.694
I know that now.

27:48.594 --> 27:50.054
I have to go,

27:50.111 --> 27:51.683
just for a couple of hours.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.441
Go where?

27:56.356 --> 27:58.059
Yeah.

27:58.336 --> 28:00.770
You know what, don't-don't answer that.

28:02.495 --> 28:04.272
I don't want to know.

28:08.267 --> 28:09.937
No one knows about this place.

28:10.215 --> 28:11.335
Okay?

28:11.479 --> 28:12.841
No one.

28:16.210 --> 28:17.701
It's safe.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.525
But just in case
something goes wrong...

28:22.663 --> 28:24.252
I-I don't want it.

28:24.277 --> 28:25.712
Noah.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.447
Give it to Noah. He knows how to shoot.

28:27.522 --> 28:28.713
Noah's not reliable.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.211
And you are?

28:32.960 --> 28:34.552
Please, Anna.

28:50.964 --> 28:52.766
Fuck you, Max.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.495
How much do you reckon it costs?

28:58.913 --> 29:01.615
Thumbprint recognition
on all the entrances.

29:01.996 --> 29:04.432
It's a waste of fucking time,
us being here.

29:07.053 --> 29:11.424
My kid, she's in a class of 36.

29:11.721 --> 29:13.153
Half of them are on free school meals.

29:13.178 --> 29:14.353
Half bloody ADHD.

29:21.302 --> 29:23.303
Security detail for Rex White.

29:23.377 --> 29:24.450
Contact White.

29:24.475 --> 29:25.843
- Do it now.
- And then what?

29:26.057 --> 29:27.260
Anything unusual,

29:27.285 --> 29:29.153
we have to report it.
Just fucking do it.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.636
...your lines. Come on!

29:30.702 --> 29:32.639
- Stop. Line up like you do here.
- Rex?

29:32.931 --> 29:34.452
- Line up.
- Rex White?

29:34.831 --> 29:35.954
Who are you?

29:36.082 --> 29:37.533
In your lines. Come on.

29:39.590 --> 29:41.155
<i> Fire alarm's
been triggered at the school.</i>

29:41.179 --> 29:42.339
They're bringing the kids out now.

29:42.388 --> 29:44.267
Find Rex. Stay with him.

29:44.437 --> 29:46.872
- Wha-What's going on? What happened?
- It's fine.

29:47.053 --> 29:48.816
Everything is fine.

29:50.028 --> 29:51.109
You stay with her.

29:51.134 --> 29:52.635
Don't let her out of your sight.

30:12.418 --> 30:13.787
Rex?

30:15.660 --> 30:17.296
Rex White?

30:20.938 --> 30:22.941
Rex?!

30:27.025 --> 30:28.567
Tell me something. Anything.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.028
Get the fuck out of the way!

30:30.295 --> 30:31.782
We don't have him, sir. Not yet.

30:31.922 --> 30:33.097
Fuck!

30:48.991 --> 30:50.926
Get out of the fucking way!

30:51.195 --> 30:52.280
Move!

30:52.323 --> 30:53.726
Come on. We have to go.

31:13.220 --> 31:15.122
Come on.

31:37.715 --> 31:38.762
<i>Turk.</i>

31:38.787 --> 31:40.055
<i> Baleh.</i>

31:44.402 --> 31:46.343
- Yeah.
- Turn on the news.

31:46.918 --> 31:48.978
<i> And your sources
are saying what exactly, Kelly?</i>

31:49.003 --> 31:50.458
<i> The Iran Directorate</i>

31:50.483 --> 31:53.453
<i>heard testimony
from an Iranian defector,</i>

31:53.478 --> 31:56.716
<i>a man named Ashkan Davoud,
who told them</i>

31:56.901 --> 31:58.866
<i>that Iran is developing</i>

31:58.891 --> 32:00.630
<i>nuclear weapons in direct</i>

32:00.655 --> 32:03.656
<i>contravention of the P5+1 agreement.</i>

32:03.815 --> 32:05.818
<i>If this turns out to be true,</i>

32:05.911 --> 32:08.252
<i>- they backed the wrong horse.
- Anything from the White House?</i>

32:08.347 --> 32:11.483
<i> Nothing. They'll have to
reinstate their credibility...</i>

32:11.628 --> 32:13.397
And so it begins.

32:13.477 --> 32:15.729
<i>Make no mistake here,
Christine, this looks bad.</i>

32:15.861 --> 32:18.484
- You fucked us, Jack.
- I made a mistake.

32:18.509 --> 32:19.960
A big fucking mistake.

32:20.004 --> 32:22.009
You fucked me,
you fucked the president,

32:22.066 --> 32:24.332
you fucked the defense
secretary, the Joint Chiefs.

32:24.410 --> 32:27.013
Shit, you might as well
have fucked the whole cabinet!

32:27.212 --> 32:29.106
The press had this before us?

32:29.131 --> 32:31.301
Are you fucking kidding me?!

32:31.856 --> 32:34.209
Why wasn't it on the president's
desk this morning?

32:34.267 --> 32:36.182
I don't go sounding the alarm

32:36.228 --> 32:39.439
every time someone brings us
a whistleblower with a story.

32:39.464 --> 32:40.903
You know how it works, Steve.

32:40.928 --> 32:42.103
There are procedures.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.565
Do I look like I give
a flying fuck about procedures?

32:44.590 --> 32:46.534
It was unverified testimony!

32:46.559 --> 32:48.328
Christ, it-it could've been soft!

32:48.553 --> 32:50.956
We don't know who Davoud is
or-or who sent him!

32:51.168 --> 32:53.830
The whole point
of the directorate is to keep

32:53.855 --> 32:56.058
the knucklehead stuff
off the president's desk!

32:56.083 --> 32:58.656
We're talking about Tehran
being six months out

32:58.683 --> 33:00.408
- from the bomb.
- Allegedly.

33:00.484 --> 33:01.602
Don't get cute with me.

33:01.674 --> 33:04.510
24 hours, I'll have something concrete.

33:05.886 --> 33:07.839
You didn't want it to be true,
and that's why you blinked.

33:07.864 --> 33:10.385
We need to find out who leaked it.

33:10.789 --> 33:13.459
That will be the job of your successor.

33:13.768 --> 33:16.248
You serve at the pleasure
of the president, Jack.

33:28.748 --> 33:30.627
Anyone but Hawes. Just...

33:33.504 --> 33:35.327
...promise me.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.856
What time are we seeing Senator Hawes?

34:56.074 --> 34:57.675
You're not Iranian.

34:59.101 --> 35:00.739
I beg your pardon?

35:00.827 --> 35:01.894
Forgive me.

35:01.919 --> 35:04.557
It's a... game I like to play.

35:07.158 --> 35:08.778
I'm sorry.

35:08.887 --> 35:10.455
You're waiting for someone.

35:10.549 --> 35:13.220
- I won't disturb you.
- No, no, no, it's-it's fine.

35:13.773 --> 35:15.093
I'm Moroccan.

35:15.466 --> 35:17.323
My father is, so...

35:18.630 --> 35:20.343
What are you doing here in Tehran?

35:20.478 --> 35:21.779
Business.

35:21.913 --> 35:23.649
My father's.

35:25.315 --> 35:28.364
I was about to grab a bite to eat.

35:28.874 --> 35:30.743
Would you like to join me?

35:31.642 --> 35:33.645
Somewhere respectable, of course.

35:34.539 --> 35:35.938
Of course.

35:36.575 --> 35:38.483
Ms. Jones,

35:39.271 --> 35:42.323
this committee would like
to hear your recommendations

35:42.348 --> 35:45.862
about how we proceed in this matter.

35:46.157 --> 35:48.665
If you had the ear of the president,

35:48.914 --> 35:50.620
what would you say?

36:16.914 --> 36:17.987
How did it go?

36:18.012 --> 36:19.714
I told them we need to send in a team.

36:19.739 --> 36:21.275
Scientists, Special Ops.

36:21.405 --> 36:23.674
Gather evidence on the ground,
cross the border.

36:23.855 --> 36:25.825
In and out. 30 minutes, tops.

36:29.574 --> 36:31.576
They can't come back.

36:33.754 --> 36:34.994
Excuse me?

36:35.100 --> 36:37.236
Whoever we send out there...

36:37.488 --> 36:40.471
they can't come back; none of them.

36:43.651 --> 36:45.750
You understand that, don't you?

36:52.883 --> 36:55.454
What line of business did you
say your father was in?

36:57.234 --> 36:58.770
I didn't.

37:00.774 --> 37:02.662
He's here with you in Tehran?

37:02.861 --> 37:04.889
No. He's dead.

37:05.264 --> 37:06.699
My condolences.

37:06.751 --> 37:08.787
I'm here with my brother.

37:13.297 --> 37:14.600
I live here.

37:14.806 --> 37:16.485
I'm just gonna dump these.

37:16.621 --> 37:18.105
Be right back.

37:28.033 --> 37:30.307
Perhaps you'd like to come in.

37:41.966 --> 37:43.225
Please.

37:44.375 --> 37:46.132
I won't be a moment.

38:25.863 --> 38:27.925
Find what you were looking for?

38:32.069 --> 38:33.548
Sit.

38:39.558 --> 38:43.329
So there you are,
reading your spy thriller,

38:43.455 --> 38:46.644
le Carré, Deighton, and they
always get to that question.

38:47.691 --> 38:49.734
20 years I've been doing this shit,

38:49.930 --> 38:52.298
never got to ask that
question, not once.

38:54.772 --> 38:58.450
So: "Who sent you?"

38:59.416 --> 39:01.824
Can't have been the Agency,
they wouldn't send you alone.

39:02.146 --> 39:03.648
London?

39:04.021 --> 39:07.198
Grey, cold little island
on the edge of Europe.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.158
Maybe.

39:10.057 --> 39:12.090
Just tell me who fucking sent you.

39:17.596 --> 39:19.732
Answer the fucking question.

41:01.876 --> 41:05.329
_

41:28.786 --> 41:30.513
Max.

41:33.720 --> 41:35.435
Max.

41:40.064 --> 41:41.598
Max!

41:43.575 --> 41:45.042
How long before you get in?

41:45.633 --> 41:48.446
Uh, depends on the phone's
encryption level.

41:52.618 --> 41:54.432
What are you gonna do?

42:26.105 --> 42:28.641
I should have guessed
you had your own...

42:29.013 --> 42:30.415
"facility."

42:37.801 --> 42:39.438
Muhammad Haykal.

42:40.564 --> 42:42.001
He was my first.

42:43.848 --> 42:45.938
Two years, three months,

42:45.963 --> 42:48.533
four days after you recruited me.

42:50.048 --> 42:51.779
Remember that?

42:52.844 --> 42:54.955
You told me we were gonna
fight the good fight.

42:55.337 --> 42:58.945
Make our corner of a dwindling
world safer for our children.

43:02.108 --> 43:04.113
I used the German Chair.

43:09.967 --> 43:12.437
Anatoly Brezkov:

43:14.616 --> 43:16.536
the Tiger Bench.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.576
We've got the Chinese to thank
for that beauty.

43:25.337 --> 43:26.961
I imagine you've never heard the sound

43:26.986 --> 43:28.661
of a man's knees snapping,

43:29.286 --> 43:30.767
have you, George?

43:34.768 --> 43:36.640
Fawwaz Zahrawi:

43:38.120 --> 43:39.842
the Parrot's Perch.

43:42.293 --> 43:44.362
Who makes up these names? Huh?

43:46.302 --> 43:47.947
They sound so innocent.

43:50.536 --> 43:52.860
I had him on that perch for hours.

43:54.974 --> 43:57.188
And I beat the soles of his feet,

43:58.445 --> 44:00.489
poured vinegar in the cuts.

44:04.748 --> 44:06.196
How many lives would have been lost,

44:06.221 --> 44:08.091
if we hadn't done what was necessary?

44:10.049 --> 44:12.448
If we hadn't turned up
to work each day?

44:14.444 --> 44:16.236
Someone has to wade through the filth.

44:16.953 --> 44:18.146
So you used to tell me.

44:18.203 --> 44:19.863
Because it's true.

44:20.870 --> 44:22.170
Is it?

44:25.277 --> 44:28.508
You start out with all this
conviction and belief.

44:28.540 --> 44:30.298
Where do you end up?

44:32.210 --> 44:34.203
Telling yourselves the things

44:34.228 --> 44:37.007
that justify whatever it is
that you do.

44:39.417 --> 44:41.511
They're just stories.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.072
That's all.

44:45.156 --> 44:47.058
Nothing more, just stories.

44:47.119 --> 44:48.429
You think you're
the only one to suffer?

44:48.453 --> 44:49.688
You could've got out.

44:49.713 --> 44:50.873
Like you?

44:50.962 --> 44:53.363
There is no way out,
not for people like me.

45:02.333 --> 45:04.336
You know once I start, I won't stop.

45:05.504 --> 45:06.874
You know that, right?

45:06.971 --> 45:08.907
I mean, you should; you taught me.

45:16.200 --> 45:17.614
Hmm.

45:18.194 --> 45:20.125
Look at that. Still life in it.

45:22.975 --> 45:24.838
German technology.

45:26.503 --> 45:28.013
Right.

45:30.675 --> 45:32.817
Why did you give the kill order
against my son?

45:33.105 --> 45:35.728
Hmm? Who was it? You?

45:36.187 --> 45:37.690
Max.

45:38.511 --> 45:40.184
Don't start pleading with me, George.

45:40.209 --> 45:41.671
I need to know where it came from

45:41.696 --> 45:43.639
and what it is you're covering up.

45:46.520 --> 45:48.913
Why do you think Harry joined
The Section?

45:51.822 --> 45:53.491
What, do you really think
he wanted to follow

45:53.516 --> 45:56.786
in your footsteps; that he
wanted to be just like you?

45:58.021 --> 45:59.590
Shut up.

46:02.267 --> 46:05.838
Babies, Max, when they're born,
they're perfect,

46:06.268 --> 46:08.175
just perfect:

46:08.687 --> 46:10.924
unblemished, untainted.

46:12.224 --> 46:14.527
Until we do a hatchet job on them,

46:14.599 --> 46:17.636
fill them full of neuroses
and then teach them to hate us.

46:19.603 --> 46:21.401
I recruited him, Max.

46:25.884 --> 46:28.120
He didn't come through Said.

46:28.232 --> 46:30.628
He didn't walk through the doors
of his own volition.

46:30.702 --> 46:32.877
I actively sought him out.

46:39.057 --> 46:40.437
It was me.

46:41.677 --> 46:43.777
Why should you be the one
that got away?

46:43.981 --> 46:48.198
You walked out,
so I took Harry instead.

46:50.501 --> 46:52.388
Just think of what we did to him,

46:53.108 --> 46:55.038
you and I,

46:55.587 --> 46:58.057
to your little boy.

47:16.654 --> 47:18.056
Feeling better?

47:19.455 --> 47:21.176
You've got a long way to go to make up

47:21.201 --> 47:23.070
for all the times you let him down.

47:23.515 --> 47:25.517
You shut the fuck up!

47:38.805 --> 47:40.352
What's the matter, Max?

47:40.990 --> 47:42.893
Have you lost your edge?

47:43.635 --> 47:45.970
Don't you disappoint me now.

47:47.737 --> 47:49.942
Do you know why I brought you back?

47:50.876 --> 47:53.413
Because you've never let me down.

47:54.131 --> 47:56.001
Don't you let me down now.

47:57.301 --> 47:58.785
All of this.

47:59.064 --> 48:00.486
It's over.

48:01.066 --> 48:02.656
It's run its course.

48:02.681 --> 48:04.110
What the fuck are you talking about?

48:04.161 --> 48:05.278
I can't do it.

48:05.303 --> 48:06.538
I don't have it in me.

48:07.065 --> 48:08.928
But you can.

48:09.594 --> 48:13.849
You burn this whole fucking mess
to the ground.

48:14.399 --> 48:17.583
And you finish it, Max. Please.

48:21.211 --> 48:23.236
You finish it.

48:27.938 --> 48:30.008
I've got something.

48:55.561 --> 48:57.286
It was hidden in his contacts.

48:57.343 --> 48:58.359
Look at this:

48:58.422 --> 49:01.592
Ashkan Davoud.
The Iranian whistle-blower;

49:02.202 --> 49:03.590
they've got him in Washington
at the moment,

49:03.614 --> 49:05.917
spilling on Tehran's nuclear program.

49:45.783 --> 49:47.443
See, there's a number here.

49:47.558 --> 49:50.395
I've run it against live
numbers, but I can't get a hit.

49:50.971 --> 49:52.671
Maybe it's not a phone number.

49:52.797 --> 49:54.278
Yeah, then what is it?

49:56.621 --> 49:58.248
Let's find out.

50:04.395 --> 50:07.350
Oh, shit. Shit.

50:09.954 --> 50:12.057
Oh, no. No.

50:12.151 --> 50:15.955
Stay with me.
Stay with me, you bastard!
