WEBVTT

00:17.601 --> 00:19.144
-Ranger!
-Baba!

00:21.480 --> 00:23.440
Lion. Where's Lion?

00:24.149 --> 00:25.526
Help me up.

00:25.609 --> 00:26.610
Watch my arm.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.489
Here. Here.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.076
Lion!

00:35.953 --> 00:36.954
Lion!

00:37.704 --> 00:40.707
Baba. Lulu?

00:40.791 --> 00:42.042
Here.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.628
I'm sorry.

00:49.675 --> 00:52.761
Whatever that was, it tore her to pieces.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.603
What kind of creature did this?

01:02.604 --> 01:03.856
They were Trivantians.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.941
This far from the border?

01:07.317 --> 01:09.653
It was revenge. For Edo.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.864
-So they were here for you.
-Lu.

01:11.947 --> 01:14.658
I told you
he would bring death to our door.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.252
I'm sorry about that.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.424
She's not wrong.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.804
I brought them here.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.307
And now Bow Lion is dead.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.103
It doesn't make sense.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.899
If I'm the Trivantians,
and I have this kind of power,

01:46.982 --> 01:48.692
why wait until now to use it?

01:49.985 --> 01:51.153
Could've obliterated you

01:51.236 --> 01:53.322
and all the armies of Paya
at Greenhill Gap.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.243
They didn't have it yet.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.288
And now they do.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.167
And now they do.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.377
Nellicut, Wallen and Yarnes.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.839
-You know them?
-Yes.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.634
All Witchfinders once under my command.

02:13.717 --> 02:17.554
These are the men who killed Row Vano.
Followers of Lucien Bray.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.107
Punishment for murder is death.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.778
The punishment for being a witch is death.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.780
If there were witches,
which there are not,

02:34.863 --> 02:36.448
that law no longer exists.

02:36.532 --> 02:37.824
You may be queen,

02:37.908 --> 02:39.785
but you are not our god.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.623
You simply saying something doesn't exist
does not make it so.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.876
It was spoken words
that declared them witches to begin with.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.379
Words from the one true God,

02:51.296 --> 02:53.257
and not the mother of witches.

02:53.799 --> 02:54.800
Heretic!

02:57.135 --> 02:58.136
You fool.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.472
Lucien Bray cares nothing for you.

03:00.556 --> 03:03.642
He'll welcome your deaths
as martyrs for his cause.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.144
I was trying to save your lives.

03:06.728 --> 03:10.232
This is where a smarter man would've
begged mercy from a merciful queen.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.651
Instead, you're gonna hang.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.152
Not for your beliefs,

03:14.236 --> 03:16.154
but because you're idiots.

03:26.498 --> 03:27.499
Tamacti.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.084
How can I sentence them to death

03:29.168 --> 03:31.712
when I spare my own sister,
who murdered hundreds?

03:31.795 --> 03:35.048
-They did burn a man alive.
-She's done so much worse.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.508
Maybe when they're killed,

03:36.592 --> 03:38.719
you can find it within yourself
to deal with Sibeth.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.808
So you think
I should kill them for practice?

03:44.892 --> 03:50.564
No. What I'm saying is their deaths serve
a greater good, law and order.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.818
And if your sister's death is
the pathway to peace with Trivantes…

03:55.444 --> 03:58.113
So this has nothing to do with
her crimes against you.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.033
I understand why you might think that.

04:01.617 --> 04:04.578
But remember,
I didn't ask for this position.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.704
I didn't even want it.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.372
I didn't want this one either.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.627
Well, then,
we can be miserable fools together.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.879
You're thinking of going back
down the mountain.

04:57.714 --> 05:01.093
They did not bring the God Thunder
this far east just to kill me.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.304
The Trivantians will be moving on Paya.

05:04.888 --> 05:05.973
Maybe.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.642
That's a problem for down there.

05:09.685 --> 05:12.771
It will be a problem up here
when the Trivantian army arrives.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.148
It seems as if they already have.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.279
I am sorry about your home.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.657
I can build another.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.413
I have to go warn Maghra.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.046
Then this is goodbye.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.719
Thank you for everything.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.474
Your wound smells clean.
It should heal nicely.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.355
Remember… stay alive.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.611
Beware of wolves, Baba Voss.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.488
Beware of wolves, Ranger.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.293
Goodbye, Lion.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.571
Who approaches?

08:09.573 --> 08:14.119
Those who used to serve
under me still know my voice.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.206
We no longer recognize
your authority, heretic.

08:17.831 --> 08:23.921
Regardless, Shiloh, I'm confident
your skull will recognize my blade.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.256
What do you want, Tamacti Jun?

08:27.090 --> 08:29.551
Just a word… with you.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.136
We all swore the same oath.

08:32.221 --> 08:36.808
I can't imagine you take any pleasure
in fighting your brothers and sisters.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.977
I do not.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.230
Yet you arrested three of us

08:41.313 --> 08:44.149
who now await execution
by your heretic queen.

08:44.775 --> 08:48.362
It was you who sent these men
to their deaths.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.573
They upheld their sacred vow.

08:52.241 --> 08:55.244
I'm sure that'll be of great comfort
to their families.

08:55.953 --> 08:59.790
How many more of your own people
will you sacrifice?

09:00.582 --> 09:01.875
As many as it takes.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.880
And you should be standing
right here beside me.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.007
Your queen has sinned before God--

09:09.091 --> 09:10.968
Not here to debate!

09:13.846 --> 09:14.847
Pathetic.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.517
This ends today.

09:20.644 --> 09:24.565
No more speeches. No more gatherings.

09:25.566 --> 09:28.694
Retire in silence.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.114
And if I don't?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.582
Then I will retire you.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.005
I was hoping you might say that.

10:54.530 --> 10:56.240
You've gotten slow in your old age.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.165
Still too fast for you.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.885
-Lucien!
-Stand down!

11:21.348 --> 11:23.100
You were a soldier of God.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.309
A man of faith.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.228
What happened to you?

11:26.812 --> 11:28.355
I died, Lucien.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.359
I went to the place where the dead go.

11:33.777 --> 11:37.739
And I've got to tell you,
it wasn't as we were told.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.995
I was disappointed.

11:44.705 --> 11:45.706
You were bewitched!

11:47.291 --> 11:49.918
Brother, you don't know the half of it.

11:50.002 --> 11:52.337
What--

12:02.055 --> 12:03.265
Go home.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.311
All of you.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.816
This church is closed.

12:32.044 --> 12:33.837
You're very good at that.

12:33.921 --> 12:37.633
-I like to think I'm a considerate host.
-But I'm still angry with you.

12:38.467 --> 12:39.968
You don't seem angry.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.887
I shouldn't be here anymore.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.139
Well, I'm pleased that you are.

12:44.223 --> 12:45.766
I'm serious.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.685
I should be back in Trivantes
with Sibeth in chains.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.355
I'll have her for you soon enough.

12:54.858 --> 12:58.570
My government is not known
for being patient, Harlan.

13:00.531 --> 13:03.700
Well, in my experience,

13:03.784 --> 13:07.704
patience, like most things,
comes at a price.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.166
Keep talking.

13:12.042 --> 13:17.297
I will arrange for an extra shipment
of coal to be transported immediately

13:18.131 --> 13:19.925
at half the regular price.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.719
At no cost.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.557
As I said, no cost.

13:28.642 --> 13:32.396
And another such shipment
for every day your queen stalls.

13:34.273 --> 13:35.566
Are you trying to break me?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.818
On the contrary,

13:37.901 --> 13:40.279
Maghra has clearly asked you
to convince me.

13:41.029 --> 13:43.532
Now I'm offering you
an incentive to convince her.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.204
I suppose it's the least I can do
in the name of peace.

13:49.872 --> 13:50.873
That's the spirit.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.542
Now you can get back to convincing me.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.426
He eats more
than both the twins did combined.

14:04.553 --> 14:05.679
If you left him here,

14:05.762 --> 14:07.890
you wouldn't be burdened
with his crying for me.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.436
It's not as if I'm going anywhere.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.563
Soothing Wolffe is not a burden.

14:15.272 --> 14:16.690
Visiting you is the chore.

14:20.235 --> 14:23.530
So I hear you've arrested the Witchfinders
who defied my edict.

14:23.614 --> 14:24.698
Good for you.

14:27.826 --> 14:30.245
Tell me, when will they be executed?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.081
Don't waver now, Maghra.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.919
You'll confirm the weakness
of your character to all.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.378
The council will eat you alive.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.757
Some might think of the sparing of lives
as strength of character.

14:42.508 --> 14:45.344
No, they won't. Not from you.

14:46.136 --> 14:50.891
As queen, sometimes you have to do things
others might consider evil,

14:50.974 --> 14:53.018
even you might consider evil,

14:53.101 --> 14:54.853
for the good of the kingdom.

14:58.190 --> 15:01.193
You serve no one
if you don't enforce the law.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.324
No one would've dared do what these
Witchfinders did while I was queen.

15:12.162 --> 15:15.541
And if I felt it necessary for any reason

15:16.291 --> 15:20.045
to pledge the sacrifice
of my own sister to the enemy…

15:20.128 --> 15:21.755
No.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.966
…I'd make damn sure
I fulfilled that promise.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.343
You don't know what you're talking about.

15:26.885 --> 15:32.307
I know the Trivantians arrived a day ago,
and yet here I am, alive and well.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.017
You're here 'cause the baby needs to eat.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.731
You have plenty of wet nurses.

15:40.315 --> 15:45.946
Would you really use my son
as an excuse for your own failings?

15:47.906 --> 15:51.827
If I were in your place,
I'd have handed them your head already.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.453
They don't want your head, Sibeth.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.707
They want you. Alive.

15:58.417 --> 15:59.459
And don't worry.

15:59.543 --> 16:01.086
I'll be out of excuses soon enough,

16:01.170 --> 16:03.130
and then you'll be
on your way to Trivantes.

16:04.173 --> 16:06.300
I'll be back when the baby's done nursing.

17:16.578 --> 17:17.954
Don't raise your voice.

17:25.587 --> 17:26.588
You.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.134
You can see?

17:33.804 --> 17:35.138
You're Jerlamarel's son.

17:36.515 --> 17:37.516
Oloman, right?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.060
I know your sister…

17:41.270 --> 17:42.271
Haniwa.

17:42.354 --> 17:43.355
Haniwa?

17:47.860 --> 17:48.986
Is she alive?

17:50.904 --> 17:52.614
She doesn't like you very much.

17:56.285 --> 17:57.619
No, I'm sure she doesn't.

17:58.704 --> 18:02.624
Those fire weapons. You made them?

18:02.708 --> 18:04.001
I had no choice.

18:06.587 --> 18:07.838
Well, you have one now.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.465
-What are you doing?
-I'm cutting you free.

18:10.549 --> 18:11.675
No, no, no. Stop.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.637
You don't understand.
They have my family.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.349
If I run, they'll kill them.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.603
Same way they killed my father.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.564
Tormada killed Jerlamarel?

18:27.274 --> 18:28.275
No.

18:30.861 --> 18:31.987
Edo Voss did.

18:33.697 --> 18:34.698
Edo?

18:37.534 --> 18:38.577
Are you sure?

18:40.537 --> 18:41.622
I was there.

18:48.003 --> 18:51.173
-Those weapons?
-Technology of the ancients.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.259
Compressed coal
that explodes when ignited.

18:55.344 --> 18:56.345
They're called bombs.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.263
I don't care what they're called.

18:59.056 --> 19:00.849
You have to stop making them.

19:00.933 --> 19:01.934
Thousands will die.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.979
Where's your family being held?

19:06.813 --> 19:08.357
At my father's compound.

19:11.860 --> 19:12.861
Okay.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.073
I will get you out of here.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.700
You'll go free your family.

19:19.451 --> 19:20.994
And I'll go back to Trivantes.

19:21.662 --> 19:24.790
When the Triangle learns Tormada's been
working with the sighted to build weapons,

19:24.873 --> 19:26.917
he'll be stripped of his rank
and put on trial.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.004
You're wrong.

19:32.506 --> 19:33.507
What?

19:34.132 --> 19:36.510
Tormada just ended the Ganite War.

19:37.511 --> 19:39.263
He'll be given a hero's welcome.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.223
-He broke the law.
-He won.

19:43.642 --> 19:45.394
Besides, we've already built
many more bombs.

19:54.820 --> 19:55.821
How many?

19:57.948 --> 19:58.949
Hundreds.

20:04.079 --> 20:06.999
Okay, new plan.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.918
We go free your family.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.463
Then we destroy the bombs.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.566
Tormada will be disappointed.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.484
He had such high hopes for you.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.827
He'll have your corpse to study at least.

20:52.794 --> 20:53.879
Oloman!

21:21.990 --> 21:23.784
I needed him alive, fools!

21:24.368 --> 21:25.410
Stop her!

21:25.494 --> 21:26.495
Stop!

22:11.331 --> 22:12.958
You're getting pretty good at that.

22:14.126 --> 22:15.210
Thanks.

22:17.588 --> 22:18.755
Is that Toad's horse?

22:19.840 --> 22:20.841
Yes.

22:23.427 --> 22:25.929
Did you ever imagine
you'd miss a Witchfinder?

22:27.514 --> 22:29.600
I could never have imagined any of this.

22:31.935 --> 22:32.936
Do you mean Wolffe?

22:34.563 --> 22:36.231
-Don't.
-Kofun.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.367
He's going through a lot.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.330
He is too sensitive.

22:52.998 --> 22:54.917
Or maybe you're not sensitive enough.

22:56.835 --> 22:59.671
Must you speak every thought
that pops into your head?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.426
Kofun became a father before he was ready.

23:05.469 --> 23:07.262
He feels ashamed and confused.

23:08.931 --> 23:10.849
So why is he punishing me?

23:11.350 --> 23:12.643
It's not my fault.

23:12.726 --> 23:15.354
No, but it is your responsibility.

23:17.231 --> 23:19.942
Feeling responsible for someone
can be a great weight.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.361
Kofun has his son.

23:23.612 --> 23:24.780
You have Kofun.

23:26.323 --> 23:27.824
And I've got you.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.286
And how often do you punish me for that?

23:35.457 --> 23:37.793
I'm sorry. I don't mean to.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.969
Everything is a mess.

23:49.638 --> 23:51.181
You're thinking of Row Vano.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.893
They burned him alive.

23:57.229 --> 23:58.689
They would have burned me too.

23:59.189 --> 24:00.190
Hey.

24:02.025 --> 24:04.653
I will never let that happen.

24:08.657 --> 24:10.826
Don't they understand
how much easier it would be

24:10.909 --> 24:12.160
for me to kill them?

24:14.788 --> 24:16.957
I could kill ten a day if I wanted.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.959
From a hundred feet away.

24:20.419 --> 24:22.212
They would never know who it was.

24:24.298 --> 24:26.675
And then you would be
everything they fear you are.

24:29.011 --> 24:32.055
I think maybe they should start fearing us
more than they do.

24:37.811 --> 24:38.812
Kofun.

24:41.106 --> 24:44.359
Are you gonna keep standing there
pretending you don't have a son?

24:47.613 --> 24:48.906
Jerlamarel had his failings,

24:48.989 --> 24:51.158
but at least
he never denied your existence.

25:07.257 --> 25:08.258
Come here.

25:10.302 --> 25:12.221
-Feel him in your arms.
-I can't.

25:14.681 --> 25:15.682
Try.

25:29.321 --> 25:30.322
You made him.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.707
I understand this is difficult for you,

25:40.791 --> 25:42.501
but we are your family now.

25:43.126 --> 25:45.629
It falls to you to protect Wolffie.

25:47.214 --> 25:48.590
And his mother.

25:55.681 --> 25:56.723
Kofun, stay.

25:57.933 --> 25:59.142
This is where you belong!

25:59.226 --> 26:01.311
-Kofun, what are you do--
-I'm leaving.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.399
Trouble in paradise.

26:05.899 --> 26:07.317
Haven't you hurt him enough?

26:07.985 --> 26:09.236
Hurt him?

26:09.319 --> 26:10.612
I mothered his child.

26:10.696 --> 26:12.990
I gave him purpose.

26:15.450 --> 26:16.451
What is it in you?

26:17.828 --> 26:20.622
This thing that needs to strike
at everyone around you.

26:23.292 --> 26:24.293
I don't know.

26:25.836 --> 26:29.423
Might be the same thing
that gave me the strength to rule.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.426
That strength you so sorely lack.

26:33.010 --> 26:34.011
I loved you.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.722
And you still do.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.896
Oh, Wolffe. It's all right.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.233
It was wrong of me
to allow you this time with Wolffe.

26:49.735 --> 26:51.111
You'll only corrupt him.

26:52.362 --> 26:53.530
As you have my son.

26:54.740 --> 26:57.618
I'm not done feeding him, Maghra.

26:57.701 --> 26:59.536
-It's all right.
-Give him back.

26:59.620 --> 27:00.871
It's all right.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.582
-He needs his mother.
-He will never know his mother.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.627
I'm done with you, Sibeth.

27:07.586 --> 27:11.381
You want me to show strength?
I'll start here.

27:12.090 --> 27:13.467
Guard!

27:13.550 --> 27:14.551
Maghra?

27:19.056 --> 27:20.057
Maghra!

27:31.109 --> 27:35.489
I'm sure the queen will be
joining us in a matter of heartbeats.

27:35.572 --> 27:37.366
You'll forgive me if I'm less confident,

27:37.449 --> 27:39.785
given the queen hasn't deigned
to grant me an audience until now.

27:39.868 --> 27:41.203
She means no offense.

27:41.286 --> 27:44.373
It's been a particularly bad day.

27:44.456 --> 27:45.457
A bad day?

27:46.458 --> 27:50.587
If I don't have Sibeth in chains soon,
there will be a lot of bad days to follow.

27:52.631 --> 27:53.882
You seem tense.

27:55.259 --> 27:58.178
I am fucking the queen's husband
in enemy territory

27:58.262 --> 28:00.722
while the fates of two nations
hang in the balance.

28:02.307 --> 28:03.392
Fair point.

28:04.768 --> 28:05.769
Harlan.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.566
All will be well, okay?

28:11.525 --> 28:13.026
You just need to relax.

28:13.110 --> 28:14.444
You're not making it easy.

28:15.821 --> 28:18.740
You're the one who's fucking
the queen's husband in enemy territory.

28:18.824 --> 28:22.619
My apologies, Ambassador Trovere,
for not greeting you sooner.

28:23.495 --> 28:25.622
It's been a trying time.

28:27.165 --> 28:30.294
Not to worry.
I am well taken care of by Lord Harlan.

28:30.377 --> 28:32.838
Yes, he's much better company than I am.

28:33.714 --> 28:35.632
Will you be joining us, my queen?

28:35.716 --> 28:37.050
Unfortunately not.

28:37.134 --> 28:40.429
There are some pressing affairs of state
that need my immediate attention.

28:40.512 --> 28:41.680
I just wanted to come by

28:41.763 --> 28:43.891
and wish you Godspeed
on your journey home.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.018
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

28:46.101 --> 28:48.270
I would have thought
Lord Harlan conveyed to you

28:48.353 --> 28:51.106
that I cannot leave
until my mandate has been satisfied.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.942
-My sister.
-That's right.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.405
And I can only imagine
how painful this is for you.

28:58.488 --> 28:59.907
You can have her.

29:00.490 --> 29:03.243
She'll be in your hands
by the rise of the God Flame.

29:04.536 --> 29:07.873
Then on behalf of the government
of Trivantes,

29:07.956 --> 29:09.708
I thank you for your hospitality.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.044
Yes, thank you.

29:19.134 --> 29:20.302
Well, that was easy.

29:48.914 --> 29:49.915
Hello?

29:51.625 --> 29:54.002
It's okay. No, no.

29:54.086 --> 29:56.547
Good boy. Stay.

29:57.756 --> 29:58.757
Baba?

30:05.138 --> 30:06.265
Maghra.

30:06.348 --> 30:08.141
Maghra. Maghra, please.

30:08.976 --> 30:10.352
Where were you?

30:11.728 --> 30:13.230
Why did you leave us?

30:27.327 --> 30:28.495
What happened to you?

30:31.498 --> 30:32.541
They found me.

30:33.292 --> 30:34.293
Who found you?

30:35.043 --> 30:36.253
The Trivantians.

30:36.753 --> 30:38.130
You were in Trivantes?

30:39.089 --> 30:43.594
No, they're here with a-- This new weapon.

30:44.219 --> 30:46.889
Something big, like God Thunder.

30:47.764 --> 30:48.932
Fire and force.

30:49.016 --> 30:51.685
It ripped open the ground beneath me.

30:57.232 --> 30:58.317
Bow Lion is dead.

31:00.861 --> 31:03.530
What? What-- Why are you--
What are you talking about?

31:04.865 --> 31:08.243
It tore her to more pieces
than I could gather and bury.

31:08.327 --> 31:09.411
All right.

31:10.329 --> 31:11.747
What is this weapon?

31:13.665 --> 31:14.750
I don't know.

31:15.834 --> 31:17.628
But they did not build it to kill me.

31:18.170 --> 31:19.880
They will come here to win their war.

31:19.963 --> 31:23.926
Baba. We are no longer at war.

31:24.635 --> 31:28.597
I've spent the time since you left
negotiating peace with the Trivantians.

31:30.390 --> 31:32.184
Well, then you have been lied to.

31:33.644 --> 31:35.354
While you were negotiating,

31:35.437 --> 31:37.606
those soldiers were
in the Northern Mountains

31:37.689 --> 31:40.067
with weapons
more powerful than you can imagine.

31:40.817 --> 31:42.611
No soldier can stand up to that thunder.

31:42.694 --> 31:45.072
The Trivantian ambassador is here.

31:45.614 --> 31:48.075
She seemed intent on achieving peace.

31:48.158 --> 31:49.993
The ambassador is here?

31:50.702 --> 31:52.454
You need to lock her up
and find what you can.

31:52.538 --> 31:56.667
I cannot lock up Ambassador Trovere
without any proof.

31:57.626 --> 31:59.962
It would end our treaty
before it's been signed.

32:00.462 --> 32:03.882
You are not listening.
There is no peace. There never was.

32:03.966 --> 32:05.050
You have been deceived.

32:05.551 --> 32:09.137
Has it maybe occurred to you
that it is you who's been deceived?

32:09.221 --> 32:11.682
Can you even be sure
it was Trivantians who attacked you?

32:11.765 --> 32:14.560
-Maghra--
-Baba, you've been away for a long time.

32:14.643 --> 32:16.895
You have no idea
what's been happening here.

32:18.438 --> 32:19.439
You're right.

32:21.650 --> 32:22.901
I was not here.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.447
And I will apologize for that later.

32:29.157 --> 32:33.579
But right now, I am telling you
that there are Trivantian soldiers in Paya

32:33.662 --> 32:37.499
with a weapon
that will tear your kingdom apart.

32:37.583 --> 32:39.918
You need to ready your armies to march.

32:40.002 --> 32:41.712
You would have us go to war?

32:41.795 --> 32:43.422
You're already at war!

32:45.257 --> 32:47.718
And the longer you hide from it,
the more we will pay.

32:56.518 --> 32:57.978
Baba.

32:58.061 --> 32:59.897
-No.
-Baba!

33:23.462 --> 33:24.796
Where's the ambassador?

33:27.799 --> 33:29.051
Where is the ambassador?

34:41.081 --> 34:42.081
Be still.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.418
Are you the ambassador?

34:45.835 --> 34:47.087
That's right.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.255
What is the meaning of this? Who are you?

34:50.007 --> 34:52.551
I will be asking the questions,
and you will be answering them.

34:52.634 --> 34:54.969
Wait, Baba Voss?

34:55.554 --> 34:56.554
What is this?

34:57.764 --> 34:58.974
-Harlan?
-Yeah.

34:59.641 --> 35:00.642
Baba Voss?

35:01.143 --> 35:03.770
-Oh, please don't kill me.
-He's not gonna kill you.

35:03.854 --> 35:07.274
Baba, release her now
or I'll have you thrown in jail.

35:07.357 --> 35:09.359
-Quiet.
-Have you lost your fucking mind?

35:10.027 --> 35:12.821
Harlan, shut up.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

35:12.905 --> 35:14.740
Good, 'cause it's getting annoying!

35:15.532 --> 35:17.242
Does Maghra even know you're here?

35:17.743 --> 35:20.120
-Does she know you're here?
-Fuck you.

35:25.709 --> 35:26.835
That's a bad idea.

36:03.705 --> 36:06.500
-Nice one. Nice.
-Nice, brother.

36:15.759 --> 36:18.303
The great traitor, Baba Voss.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.392
I will execute you where you stand.

36:23.475 --> 36:25.894
Ambassador.

36:25.978 --> 36:27.813
While you're rightfully upset
at the intrusion,

36:27.896 --> 36:29.189
I would just advise caution.

36:29.273 --> 36:31.775
-He attacked me.
-And he will be made to pay.

36:31.859 --> 36:32.985
I'm just saying…

36:33.694 --> 36:36.780
we're in the final stage of a peace
treaty you've worked so hard to achieve.

36:36.864 --> 36:39.199
There is no peace. You are a liar.

36:39.283 --> 36:41.618
Baba Voss,
you have never been one for words.

36:41.702 --> 36:43.537
Now is a good time
to keep your mouth shut.

36:43.620 --> 36:47.082
Her army is in Paya
with weapons of thunder and fire.

36:47.165 --> 36:49.877
Even now they are moving
across the Northern Mountains.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.880
For fuck's sake. Thunder and fire?
What are you talking about?

36:52.963 --> 36:56.300
I will not be called a liar
by this treasonous scum!

36:59.678 --> 37:01.889
Stop, all of you, by my command.

37:03.140 --> 37:04.808
And Maghra. Excellent.

37:07.769 --> 37:08.937
I said stop!

37:10.314 --> 37:11.648
Trovere.

37:12.900 --> 37:13.901
Please.

37:16.236 --> 37:17.279
Stand down.

37:20.699 --> 37:21.742
Stand down.

37:24.578 --> 37:25.579
Haniwa.

37:27.664 --> 37:29.208
In all my years,

37:29.291 --> 37:33.003
I have never witnessed such a blatant
breach of diplomatic protocols.

37:33.086 --> 37:36.048
He injured my soldiers,
and he attacked me in my own bed.

37:44.431 --> 37:47.935
Baba, what have you done?

37:49.436 --> 37:51.772
You are being deceived, my love.

37:51.855 --> 37:54.650
You've given me no time
to consider your words.

37:54.733 --> 37:56.276
You left me no choice.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.111
And you leave me with none.

37:59.029 --> 38:03.617
Your reckless behavior has put our peace
and the lives of every Payan at risk.

38:05.869 --> 38:07.412
Arrest Baba Voss immediately.

38:07.496 --> 38:09.289
Mama! No!

38:09.373 --> 38:11.917
Place him under guard at my house
until I return.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.253
If he resists, confine him to the dungeon.

38:14.336 --> 38:16.713
It's all right, Haniwa. I will not resist.

38:20.592 --> 38:22.803
Ambassador Trovere, I assure you

38:22.886 --> 38:26.557
I would never do anything
to jeopardize the peace we have forged.

38:26.640 --> 38:29.601
Let me remind you,
in case you've forgotten,

38:29.685 --> 38:31.895
your sister murdered our peace delegates

38:31.979 --> 38:34.690
the last time our two nations met
under the terms of a truce.

38:35.524 --> 38:36.567
I understand.

38:37.276 --> 38:40.445
And believe me when I say
I am nothing like my sister.

38:41.655 --> 38:44.324
I hope you will accept my sincere apology.

38:44.908 --> 38:48.036
Forgive me if, at this moment,
I am not sure I will.

38:58.672 --> 38:59.756
When did he get back?

39:00.549 --> 39:01.550
Tonight.

39:03.427 --> 39:05.888
Well, didn't waste any time, did he?

39:05.971 --> 39:06.972
Harlan.

39:07.764 --> 39:09.349
He may have just cost us everything.

39:09.433 --> 39:12.519
Harlan, what if he's right?

39:15.522 --> 39:19.860
You mean the Trivantians have
a new weapon of fire and thunder?

39:20.777 --> 39:21.904
But instead of attack us,

39:21.987 --> 39:24.031
they go all the way
into the Northern Mountains

39:24.114 --> 39:25.407
to attack one man?

39:29.203 --> 39:30.204
Yeah.

39:31.997 --> 39:34.208
I'll see what I can do
to soothe the ambassador.

39:58.774 --> 39:59.900
Whose baby is this?

40:01.318 --> 40:02.319
We need to talk.

40:04.947 --> 40:05.948
It is ours.

40:07.824 --> 40:08.825
No.

40:12.287 --> 40:13.288
Harlan.

40:13.872 --> 40:15.082
Of course not.

40:15.165 --> 40:16.708
You may have abandoned me…

40:16.792 --> 40:18.335
but I did not do the same.

40:18.418 --> 40:19.419
Then whose?

40:22.881 --> 40:24.341
His name is Wolffe.

40:25.467 --> 40:26.635
He's Kofun's.

40:28.345 --> 40:32.349
-Kofun's?
-Baba, there's so much I have to tell you.

40:34.268 --> 40:36.812
Why is the baby with you?
Why is it not with the mother?

40:38.105 --> 40:40.816
The mother is Sibeth.

40:40.899 --> 40:43.652
-What? How is that?
-She seduced him.

40:44.987 --> 40:46.572
-She's a prisoner.
-Before that.

40:46.655 --> 40:48.991
Baba, we've been dealing with a lot
while you've been gone.

40:49.074 --> 40:50.075
Oh, no.

40:51.618 --> 40:54.913
If this is Kofun's child,
then why is it not with him?

40:55.873 --> 40:58.750
He's having a hard time
accepting the child as his own.

41:01.670 --> 41:03.380
And so the baby is in your care?

41:04.798 --> 41:05.799
Where's Paris?

41:10.387 --> 41:11.388
Where is Paris?

41:13.807 --> 41:15.809
Sibeth!

41:18.645 --> 41:20.230
Baba! Stop.

41:21.356 --> 41:24.318
We are turning Sibeth in
to the Trivantians in the morning.

41:24.401 --> 41:28.739
I promise you, nothing you would do
will compare to what they will do to her.

41:29.239 --> 41:30.991
-Sibeth!
-Baba, stop!

41:38.749 --> 41:40.417
-Where is she?
-Guards!
