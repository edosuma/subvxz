00:02.435 --> 00:06.038
- Yesterday, angela may
or may not have figured out

00:06.040 --> 00:08.607
That I'm having an affair
with her husband.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.010
So I just have to wait
and see.

00:11.012 --> 00:13.245
When she comes in,
if she's cold

00:13.247 --> 00:15.447
And awkward and cruel to me,
then great,

00:15.449 --> 00:18.050
It's business as usual.

00:21.321 --> 00:24.023
Good morning.
[clears throat]

00:28.595 --> 00:32.364
- Oscar...

00:32.366 --> 00:34.500
[sighs]

00:34.502 --> 00:36.035
Can I ask you a question?

00:36.037 --> 00:39.271
- [whispering]
of course, ask me a que--

00:39.273 --> 00:41.340
Questions.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.809
- Is it cool in here
to you?

00:47.147 --> 00:48.647
- [hoarsely]
yes, a little bit.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.049
[normal voice]
yes.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.717
- I think the thermostat
is acting up again.

00:51.719 --> 00:55.187
- It's the stupid thermostat!
That thing's a catastrophe.

00:55.189 --> 00:58.223
So I'm gonna, um,
on your suggestion,

00:58.225 --> 00:59.258
Get someone to fix it.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.726
I'll just go downstairs.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.195
- Thank you.
- No, thank you, angela.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.330
She doesn't know.

01:05.332 --> 01:07.166
I shouldn't be surprised.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.600
This is a woman
who married a man

01:08.602 --> 01:10.436
Who is obviously
a homosexual.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.238
Basically, she has her head
in the sand.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.241
In a way,
I feel sorry for her.

01:16.243 --> 01:20.079
I guess the universe rewards
true love.

01:20.081 --> 01:23.082
[cheerful music]

01:23.084 --> 01:29.321
â™ª

01:29.323 --> 01:32.257
- Well, well, well,
it's finally happened--

01:32.259 --> 01:34.126
Pam has ceased caring.

01:34.128 --> 01:37.696
- These are my
painting clothes.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.264
I think I'm gonna do it.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.200
I am really gonna
start painting

01:41.202 --> 01:42.534
The warehouse mural today.
[jim applauds]

01:42.536 --> 01:43.702
- Sure you don't want
to put another coat

01:43.704 --> 01:45.304
Of primer
on that, pam?

01:45.306 --> 01:46.505
Queen of the primer,
that one.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.774
- You got this, beesley.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.242
Actually, do you want me
to come down

01:50.244 --> 01:51.376
And help you get started?

01:51.378 --> 01:52.611
- Are you avoiding
your phone call?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.613
- What? No.
Yeah, right.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.381
As if.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.283
Today, I will be
asking david wallace

01:58.285 --> 02:01.687
Because the sports marketing
company that I started

02:01.689 --> 02:03.589
Really needs me
to be there.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.557
- Last week,
jim wasn't there,

02:05.559 --> 02:08.494
And they named the company
<i>athlead.</i>

02:08.496 --> 02:10.362
- I could have prevented that.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.364
So I have to talk
to wallace.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.633
- Tell them your opening line.
- [sighs]

02:14.635 --> 02:17.269
Hey, david, how would you like
a guy who's not here as much,

02:17.271 --> 02:18.637
Gets paid the same amount
of salary,

02:18.639 --> 02:22.374
And has bigger fish to fry
in philadelphia?

02:22.376 --> 02:24.743
- I think it's good.
He likes fishing.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.379
- This is gonna be awful.

02:27.381 --> 02:30.549
- One of my jobs is to input
customer complaints

02:30.551 --> 02:32.317
Into the computer.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.254
And when they're in,
I fill out one of these cards.

02:35.256 --> 02:38.590
But the information's
already on the computer, so...

02:38.592 --> 02:40.492
Why am I filling out
the card?

02:40.494 --> 02:45.197
I asked andy, and he told me
to "chillax,"

02:45.199 --> 02:47.466
And then went away
on a big long boat ride.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.434
So here we are.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.403
Don't give me
a pointless office chore,

02:51.405 --> 02:54.840
Because I will build
a little paper house.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.643
Fight the power.

02:57.645 --> 03:02.281
[vending machine humming]

03:02.283 --> 03:04.583
- Meet me in the old place,
five minutes.

03:04.585 --> 03:08.320
I need you.

03:15.662 --> 03:16.728
Ugh.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.230
- Come on in,
the water's fine.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.465
- Dwight, it's not
that kind of meeting.

03:20.467 --> 03:21.833
Put your clothes back on.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.569
- I know.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.737
That's not why
I'm naked.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.773
I always work out
without my clothes.

03:27.775 --> 03:31.243
- Just put them on!
Put on your clothes.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.744
I need your help.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.580
I need someone who can operate
outside of the law.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.915
Ugh.
- Oh, I'm sorry,

03:36.917 --> 03:39.685
Your vigilante privileges ended
when you broke up with me.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.354
If I'm not in your panties,
I don't go vigilantes.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.855
Why don't you ask
your husband?

03:43.857 --> 03:46.225
- My marriage is in danger.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.360
I don't know who
I can trust.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.729
I need someone
to be there for me.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.665
- [sighs]
all right, what are we talking?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.767
Surveillance, wire-tapping?
- Something like that.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.237
- Yeah, the less I know,
the better.

03:58.239 --> 04:01.907
He was a volunteer sheriff too.
Kicked off the force.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.577
- Can you arrange a meeting?
- I can try.

04:05.579 --> 04:10.415
I'm gonna use sms text.
- Okay.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.417
Text went through.
- Okay.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.752
- All we can do is
sit and wait.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.287
- Okay.
[phone vibrates]

04:15.289 --> 04:17.356
- Oh.
Look at that.

04:17.358 --> 04:22.027
Yeah, he's free anytime.
Not a problem.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.263
- I mean, I can handle
any client issues from philly.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.665
- Yeah, but I really need
someone in the office.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.401
If there's a crisis--
the more I think about it--

04:29.403 --> 04:31.303
- Oh, you mean handle it
in person.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.573
Oh, well, phyllis and stanley
have agreed to cover for me

04:34.575 --> 04:36.575
While I'm gone.
- They did?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.443
- Yep.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.911
- Oh, okay.
Well, that is different.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.347
In that case, yes--
maybe this can work.

04:42.349 --> 04:43.649
- Oh, great.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.284
- Why should we help you?

04:45.286 --> 04:47.352
- Because we're friends.

04:47.354 --> 04:48.520
- When is my birthday?

04:48.522 --> 04:50.489
- Unfair.
When's <i>my</i> birthday?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.524
- I don't know,
because we're not friends.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.692
- How about this--

04:53.694 --> 04:55.060
You let me
take you to lunch,

04:55.062 --> 04:56.295
And I make my case?

04:56.297 --> 04:58.330
- Now we're talkin'.
- All right.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.465
- Yeah.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.835
- Make it go taller.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.671
- That's the idea.

05:05.673 --> 05:09.841
- No, not taller this way,
taller this way.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.777
- Well, I've gotta build
a wider base first

05:11.779 --> 05:13.345
Before I can go higher.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.380
- You're not getting this,
peter.

05:15.382 --> 05:18.383
Make it go wider...Up!

05:18.385 --> 05:21.653
- Will do.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.921
- What are y'all doing?

05:22.923 --> 05:25.057
- Me and pete are
building a tower.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.759
- Cool. It should be taller,
though, right?

05:27.761 --> 05:29.594
- Obviously.

05:29.596 --> 05:32.064
He's a sweet kid, darryl,

05:32.066 --> 05:36.535
But he's not the sharpest guy
in the drawer.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.004
- Kevin, I can hear you.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.972
- Huh?

05:44.410 --> 05:45.410
- Ow! Dwight! Ow!

05:45.412 --> 05:51.049
- Get in the van.
- God!

05:51.051 --> 05:54.753
- Well, this documentary crew
has been following

05:54.755 --> 05:56.355
Our every move
for the past nine years,

05:56.357 --> 05:59.524
But I don't see them
so I think we're good.

05:59.526 --> 06:03.628
- So what are your
credentials?

06:03.630 --> 06:06.365
- I started following people
around to get exercise.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.133
Turns out
I'm damn good at it.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.402
- Do you have a gun?
- [snickers]

06:10.404 --> 06:13.372
- Does he own a gun?
Show her.

06:13.374 --> 06:17.008
- You tell me.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.577
- What is this?

06:18.579 --> 06:21.146
It's the receipt
for my gun.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.014
- You don't carry it
with you?

06:23.016 --> 06:27.619
That's a $300 gun.
Someone could steal it.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.020
- Do you have any idea
how many guns

06:29.022 --> 06:30.122
Trevor's had stolen
from him?

06:30.124 --> 06:31.623
- Now I keep it in a safe.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.860
- Mm-hmm. Good safe?
- Oh, you tell me.

06:37.096 --> 06:39.030
- Wow!

06:52.479 --> 06:57.015
I can just paint over it
with a shrub or something.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.683
It's just I think less
of paintings

06:58.685 --> 07:00.152
With a lot of shrubs.

07:00.154 --> 07:04.589
So I'm gonna limit myself
to one shrub.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.924
- You paint wall now?

07:05.926 --> 07:09.561
- Yeah.
Painting now.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.864
I just want
to make sure that...

07:12.866 --> 07:14.032
- You paint now.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.067
- It's probably gonna be
a few minutes.

07:16.069 --> 07:20.839
So you can just go back to doing
whatever you were doing.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.174
- I wait.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.811
- Sweet.
- Yay!

07:25.813 --> 07:27.012
[applause]

07:27.014 --> 07:28.847
- This next card comes to us

07:28.849 --> 07:30.816
Thanks to meredith palmer,

07:30.818 --> 07:32.217
Who called eastern
pennsylvania seminary

07:32.219 --> 07:34.653
A, quote,
"sausage factory."

07:34.655 --> 07:36.588
- Oh-ooooh!
[approving cheers]

07:36.590 --> 07:38.223
Boom!
- Bang!

07:38.225 --> 07:40.792
- Yep, yep, yep.
- All right.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.862
Up next we got
a whole lotta creed.

07:43.864 --> 07:47.165
- Let's find out what I did.
- All right.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.867
- You get half now,
and you get half

07:48.869 --> 07:50.769
Upon completion
of said job.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.572
- And that's all off the books?
- Obviously.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.707
- Nice.
No taxes.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.109
- Okay, so everything you need
to know about the target

07:58.111 --> 07:59.110
Is in here.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.213
- So what's the job?

08:01.215 --> 08:04.049
- Murder.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.885
- Okay, that's the big one.
That's the big "m."

08:08.821 --> 08:10.222
- You can't have someone
murdered.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.890
- What if they deserved it?

08:11.892 --> 08:12.958
- What did they do to you,
angela?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.026
- They're sleeping
with my husband.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.096
- Oh, monkey.
Oh, I feel for you.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.232
- This seems a little crazy.
- Yes. Crazy.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.200
- Thank you.
- But I think I'm up for it.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.170
- Absolutely not. There are
a lot of different ways

08:25.172 --> 08:26.505
To get revenge.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.606
I've had great success
by defecating

08:27.608 --> 08:28.874
In a paper bag,
put it on the porch--

08:28.876 --> 08:32.677
I've been on the receiving end
of that quite a few times.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.279
It's devastating.
- No, no, no.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.982
It has to be physical.
I want this person to suffer.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.149
- What about a knee-capping?

08:38.151 --> 08:39.618
- No! You're not helping,
trevor!

08:39.620 --> 08:42.220
- Yes, a knee-capping
could work.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.156
- No. Angela!
What are you saying?

08:45.158 --> 08:47.025
- You said you would
be there for me.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.227
- I'm trying,
but what you're asking is--

08:49.229 --> 08:52.597
- It's the only thing
that will make this right.

08:52.599 --> 08:56.034
- Okay.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.037
But it's cruel, because a woman
with damaged knees

08:59.039 --> 09:00.171
Can't scrub worth a damn.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.008
- All right,
then it's settled.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.609
One knee-capping.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.845
Now, the hit goes down
at 4:00.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.948
Keep in mind, once I leave,
there's no turning back.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.584
- You know,
truth be told,

09:12.586 --> 09:14.152
I think all
you'll really be doing is

09:14.154 --> 09:16.221
Accepting calls from my clients
while I'm gone.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.924
- We've got all afternoon
to talk about that.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.860
- Morning, folks.
- I'll have the surf and turf

09:21.862 --> 09:23.595
With a side order of lobster.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.964
- Actually, the surf and turf
does come with lob--

09:25.966 --> 09:27.899
- Not enough lobster.
Side order.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.236
- How much wine
do you have?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.971
- I brought you a cookie.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.640
- Oh, thanks, oscar.

09:35.642 --> 09:36.875
You're such an angel.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.958
- I just gave her a cookie,
and she called me an angel,

09:52.960 --> 09:58.163
So...Yeah, we're good. Yeah.
[exhales]

09:58.165 --> 10:00.231
We dodged a bullet, yes.
Okay.

10:00.233 --> 10:03.234
Yeah. Yeah, yeah--
well, I gotta go now, but--

10:03.236 --> 10:05.136
Okay, bye. Bye.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.138
- There we go.
[cheers and applause]

10:07.140 --> 10:10.108
- Nicely done.
Very nicely done.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.310
- All right, this next one
goes to darryl

10:12.312 --> 10:15.880
For pocket dialing a customer
while having sex.

10:15.882 --> 10:19.284
- Ooohh...You salty dog.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.920
- Well, yeah, what can I say,
a player's gotta play.

10:21.922 --> 10:26.791
- Actually, that was the sound
of me eating spaghetti.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.227
But I'm gonna let them think
the other thing.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.262
- Okay, I got this one.
- Oh, be careful.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.164
Be careful, be careful.
- No, I got it.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.166
Easy does it, everyone.

10:35.168 --> 10:40.071
Nobody even take a breath.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.239
[overlapping shouts]

10:41.241 --> 10:42.941
- Kevin!

10:42.943 --> 10:44.309
[overlapping chatter]
- what did I say?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.810
What did I just say?

10:45.812 --> 10:48.313
- Hey, hey, hey,
it's just a mistake.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.649
Just a mistake. That's what
this tower's all about--

10:50.651 --> 10:51.983
Mistakes.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.252
Okay, if you're afraid
of screwing up,

10:54.254 --> 10:55.754
The tower's not for you.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.990
Show of hands--who here
has never had a complaint?

10:58.992 --> 11:02.093
That's right.
Nobody.

11:02.095 --> 11:05.830
See that?
Nobody. Okay?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.699
Let's get back to work, huh?

11:07.701 --> 11:10.702
Come on, you in?

11:10.704 --> 11:13.905
Yeah. There we go.
All right, let's do it.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.108
- You know,
at the end of the day

11:17.110 --> 11:18.843
It's really only two days,
remember.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.245
I mean, I'll be back
in the office.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.681
If you need me
for an emergency, call me.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.715
I'll be there--
- you know what?

11:23.717 --> 11:26.084
I don't know where
the years went.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.019
'cause sometimes
when I look at my hands,

11:28.021 --> 11:29.888
I don't even recognize them.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.223
- Tell me about it.
- Whose hands are these?

11:32.225 --> 11:34.292
They're not my hands.
I don't know.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.194
- All right.
You know what?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.195
Maybe we'll just--
- uhh--

11:37.197 --> 11:38.863
- We'll go slow.
- No. Jim...

11:38.865 --> 11:40.365
[bottle clangs]

11:40.367 --> 11:41.366
- All right,
check it out, huh?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.467
[cheers and applause]

11:42.469 --> 11:45.336
Like a phoenix
from the ashes. Ksshhhh!

11:45.338 --> 11:47.005
- Nice.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.407
- Pretty soon, we're gonna be
at the ceiling.

11:49.409 --> 11:53.011
- Whoo!
- Can you hand me a card?

11:53.013 --> 11:54.479
- Um, it's empty.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.781
- What?
- Oh, come on.

11:56.783 --> 11:57.782
We could use a blank card.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.185
All: No!
- That's cheating.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.286
- I could get us a complaint.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.723
- You?
Little miss priss?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.224
You wouldn't fart
on a butterfly.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.392
- No, I wouldn't.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.861
I can't even relate
to that impulse.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.996
But I bet I could get us
a customer complaint.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.364
I'd like to try.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.201
- Hmm. Yeah.
- All right.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.236
- Yeah, go, pam! Pam...

12:18.238 --> 12:24.309
[all chanting "pam"]

12:27.113 --> 12:29.247
- What? Why did you
call me out here?

12:29.249 --> 12:33.284
- The target--
it's oscar, isn't it?

12:33.286 --> 12:34.953
He and the senator
are gaying each other.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.122
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.990
- Your nostrils tell
a different story.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.459
They flare like that every time
you're engaging in deception.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.328
Hello again,
naughty nostrils.

12:43.330 --> 12:46.297
- Fine! It's oscar.
So what?

12:46.299 --> 12:47.832
- Well, I could understand you
wanting

12:47.834 --> 12:49.501
To get a stranger's
knees whacked.

12:49.503 --> 12:52.003
But a co-worker--
dare I say a <i>friend?</i>

12:52.005 --> 12:53.538
- Exactly, a friend.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.974
Someone who sits next to you
year after year,

12:55.976 --> 12:57.442
Making chitchat and smiling,

12:57.444 --> 12:59.344
And all the while
running behind your back

12:59.346 --> 13:02.347
And defiling your marriage
and seducing your husband.

13:02.349 --> 13:07.318
- I can't even imagine how
painful this must be for you.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.187
But the first ones
to break your marriage vows

13:09.189 --> 13:11.189
Were you and me.

13:11.191 --> 13:15.860
- Well, you might be right,
but it's too late now.

13:15.862 --> 13:19.864
- What do you mean?
- He's here.

13:19.866 --> 13:24.569
- No! No, no!
[groans]

13:27.306 --> 13:28.540
- Oscar?

13:28.542 --> 13:30.809
Oscar. Oscar. Good.
Listen.

13:30.811 --> 13:35.180
- There are a bunch
of construction workers

13:35.182 --> 13:36.848
In the warehouse
without their trousers,

13:36.850 --> 13:38.483
Drinking diet sodas.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.819
You have got to see this.
They're extraordinary.

13:40.821 --> 13:44.489
- Yahtzee.

13:49.228 --> 13:53.064
- Sandwich delivery
for mr. Oscar martinez.

13:55.568 --> 13:59.270
- I am oscar martinez.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.206
- No, not him, not him.
Outside.

14:01.208 --> 14:05.009
Outside.

14:05.011 --> 14:08.079
- You know, there's doughnuts
in the break room.

14:08.081 --> 14:11.149
- Nice!
- Yeah.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.851
- Listen,
I was really wondering

14:12.853 --> 14:14.919
If maybe we could lock this down
before lunch is over.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.888
- Don't be pushy, jim.
It's tacky.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.857
- All right.
Phyllis!

14:18.859 --> 14:21.059
Phyllis, that's--
that's decorative.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.529
- Still decorative.
- Is it white wine?

14:24.531 --> 14:26.331
- No. Maybe stop with the--

14:26.333 --> 14:28.199
Don't poke people
with knives.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.034
- [groans] ha ha!
- Phyllis!

14:30.036 --> 14:31.135
- Wow.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.937
- Bring it over.
- Got it.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.974
- There's no time to explain.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.212
Okay, actually,
there is time to explain.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.281
When angela found out
that you seduced her husband,

14:43.283 --> 14:45.116
We hired a guy
to break your kneecaps.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.285
- Oh, my god!
What is wrong with you?

14:47.287 --> 14:49.187
- What is wrong with <i>you?</i>

14:49.189 --> 14:50.955
There are a million
gorgeous guys

14:50.957 --> 14:54.626
And you choose the man
who's the father of her child?

14:54.628 --> 14:56.060
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.662
- Oh, don't lie.
I'm trying to save

14:57.664 --> 15:02.934
Now, let's get out of here.
He could be right behind us.

15:02.936 --> 15:07.005
Aah! Actually,
he's right in front of us.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.640
- Let's get it on.
I'm gonna do this.

15:08.642 --> 15:11.242
I might--I might puke,
but I'm gonna do this.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.011
- No, trevor,
I am not gonna let you.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.313
He's a dunder mifflin man.
He's my tribe.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.649
- I'm sorry, dwight,
but for once in my stupid,

15:17.651 --> 15:19.384
Stupid life, I'm gonna
follow through on something,

15:19.386 --> 15:21.619
All right?
I have masculinity issues--

15:21.621 --> 15:24.289
- Stop! No!
- I got it.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.423
- Disarm!
- You don't--

15:25.425 --> 15:28.293
[all grunting]

15:28.295 --> 15:30.128
- Don't move.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.963
- And disarm now!

15:31.965 --> 15:34.299
- Okay. Okay, okay...

15:34.301 --> 15:36.134
- No, oscar, no.
No, he's a friend.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.669
He's a friend.

15:37.671 --> 15:40.972
- Okay, the client is
heymont brake and tire.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.474
They're family-owned, but don't
let that take away your edge!

15:43.476 --> 15:45.476
- Come on, pam,
I know you can fail.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.211
I see failure in you.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.013
- Remember,
you're a scumbag,

15:49.015 --> 15:52.684
So you think scummy thoughts.
Like this.

15:52.686 --> 15:56.220
- Hello,
this is pam halpert.

15:56.222 --> 15:57.689
I'm calling
from dunder mifflin.

15:57.691 --> 16:00.124
Yes, your paper provider.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.561
And I just called to say...

16:03.563 --> 16:06.064
Your mama is so fat,
when she wears red,

16:06.066 --> 16:07.465
People yell,
"hey, kool-aid."

16:07.467 --> 16:11.402
Yeah, your mama's fat.
This is pam halpert.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.038
- Did she buy it?
- Did they say anything?

16:14.040 --> 16:15.206
- I don't know.
I couldn't tell. I don't--

16:15.208 --> 16:18.176
- I--I felt like
they were confused, at least.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.412
- Okay.
[phone rings]

16:25.184 --> 16:27.251
- Dunder mifflin.
This is erin.

16:27.253 --> 16:31.222
- Yes, you can. Okay.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.192
I will make sure
that goes on file.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.662
Ladies and gentlemen,
we just lost a client!

16:37.664 --> 16:40.698
[all cheer]
- nice. Nice.

16:40.700 --> 16:44.202
- You did good. You did good.
- See ya later, heymont.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.739
- No.
- Oh. Oh...

16:47.741 --> 16:50.441
- If you chase me,
I will run so fast.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.443
If you catch me,
I will bite so hard.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.413
- Got it?
Good-bye, my friend.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.782
- What the hell, dwight?
- See you later, trevor.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.584
- You are incorrigible!

16:59.586 --> 17:02.120
- I just saved your life.
You're welcome!

17:05.157 --> 17:08.326
- You hired someone
to hit me with a pipe!

17:08.328 --> 17:10.561
- You deserved
every bit of it!

17:10.563 --> 17:13.398
You made my husband gay.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.366
- What--what I did was wrong,

17:15.368 --> 17:17.201
And I have to live with that
every day.

17:17.203 --> 17:22.206
But your husband <i>is</i> gay.
He was gay when you married him!

17:22.208 --> 17:24.275
- No. No.
- Angela, until you face that,

17:24.277 --> 17:26.577
You're gonna be confused and
angry for all the wrong reasons.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.547
But if you want to blame me
for the whole thing,

17:29.549 --> 17:31.816
Go ahead--
I won't stop you.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.285
Hit me.
You have my blessing. Hit me.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.754
- Well, are you gonna
let go of it?

17:36.756 --> 17:39.157
Because part of the blame
is definitely on you.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.225
- Angela, it's
a lead freaking pipe.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.460
- God!
- Aah!

17:42.462 --> 17:44.328
- You were supposed
to be my friend.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.131
- I'm so sorry. Angela--
- oscar.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.171
- Our crowning complaint card
comes to us

17:53.173 --> 17:55.506
Thanks to pamela halpert...

17:55.508 --> 17:58.309
[cheers and applause]

17:58.311 --> 18:01.846
For insulting a client's
recently deceased mother.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.348
- Yes!
- I did not know that.

18:04.350 --> 18:07.819
- Well, a woman who struggled
with obesity all her life.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.520
- I'm so sorry.
- Wow.

18:09.522 --> 18:14.559
- Yeah, that's--
that is terrible.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.295
[cheers and applause]

18:17.297 --> 18:20.264
- You did it.
- Yeah!

18:27.739 --> 18:30.108
- I feel so stupid

18:30.110 --> 18:33.311
I sit next to him
every day.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.881
- You're not stupid.
Jazz is stupid.

18:36.883 --> 18:41.119
- Jazz is stupid!

18:41.121 --> 18:43.387
I mean,
just play the right notes!

18:43.389 --> 18:47.825
- I know.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.427
You're gonna be okay, monkey.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.238
- I don't like
your friend trevor.

19:00.240 --> 19:05.476
- I don't like him either.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.512
And yet,
I really like him.

19:13.619 --> 19:17.321
- Well, we're here.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.824
Perfect.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.266
- We're gonna cover
for you, you know.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.667
[stanley chuckles]

19:29.669 --> 19:31.402
- Phyllis, what was that?

19:31.404 --> 19:33.437
Phyllis,
are you dreaming, or--

19:33.439 --> 19:37.408
- I did enjoy
grinding your beans, son.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.411
- Yeah, we really did
peel your grapes.

19:40.413 --> 19:43.281
- This is hilarious,
but we're gonna stop with all--

19:43.283 --> 19:46.184
- Shuckin' your peas.
- Shuckin' the peas.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.618
You should go back
to the first part, though.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.187
You are gonna cover for me?

19:49.189 --> 19:51.923
- Yeah.
- Of course we are, jimmy.

19:51.925 --> 19:53.224
We love you guys.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.594
- Oh, my god, thank you.
Thank you.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.864
- If you're an artist, you have
to be okay with the idea

19:59.866 --> 20:02.333
That you can't please everybody
all the time.

20:02.335 --> 20:05.636
- You paint very bad--
- shut up, hide!

20:05.638 --> 20:07.271
I mean, do you think
kevin cares

20:07.273 --> 20:09.674
What people think about him--
or creed or meredith?

20:09.676 --> 20:11.275
[all cheering]

20:11.277 --> 20:14.745
Oh, my gosh, these are
my role models now.

20:14.747 --> 20:18.382
You know what?
I'm okay with that.

20:21.420 --> 20:22.753
- Where does gayness
come from,

20:22.755 --> 20:24.722
And how is it transmitted?

20:24.724 --> 20:27.792
- That is--
that is a loaded question.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.661
- My pastor said it can come
from breast feeding.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.830
- He said that?

20:32.832 --> 20:34.398
- Well, he didn't
fight me hard on it.

20:34.400 --> 20:39.003
- I--I don't know if there's
truth to--to, uh, that.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.272
- What is it called
when two men

20:41.274 --> 20:42.807
Intertwine their penises

20:42.809 --> 20:45.576
Like the snakes
on the medic-alert bracelet?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.812
- Oh...Uh...

20:47.814 --> 20:50.881
- Is it called red-vining?
- Is it called red-vining?

20:50.883 --> 20:52.883
- We heard it was called
red-vining.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.852
- People red-vine.

20:54.854 --> 20:59.824
- Where are gay men's
vaginas?

20:59.826 --> 21:02.360
- They don't have vaginas.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.794
- What?

21:03.796 --> 21:08.032
- No. They're just
regular men

21:08.034 --> 21:10.768
- When two gay men have sex,

21:10.770 --> 21:13.704
How do they know whose penis
will open up

21:13.706 --> 21:16.407
To accept the other person's
penis?

21:16.409 --> 21:20.578
- Uh...Wow.
