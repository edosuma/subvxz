00:02.333 --> 00:03.583
(male narrator)
Previously on "Babylon 5.."

00:03.667 --> 00:04.917
Any change
in those seismic disturbances?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.292
The surface layer's calmed down,
but we're still

00:06.375 --> 00:08.167
picking up rumbles
from further down.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.583
(Sinclair)
Best to check it out,
just to be sure.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.083
(Tasaki)
'Activate scanners.'

00:11.167 --> 00:14.458
- 'Set for maximum depth.'
- What the hell was it?

00:14.542 --> 00:16.125
All of our readouts
blacked out for a second.

00:16.208 --> 00:17.417
(Tasaki)
'It must have come
from somewhere'

00:17.500 --> 00:18.667
'deep inside the planet.'

00:18.750 --> 00:20.667
As ISN viewers may know,
all contact

00:20.750 --> 00:22.292
with the Mars Colony
has been cut off.

00:22.375 --> 00:23.667
What the hell do you mean
you can't get

00:23.750 --> 00:25.292
a signal through
to the Mars Colony?

00:25.375 --> 00:26.708
Communications are out, except

00:26.792 --> 00:28.042
for authorized personnel.

00:28.125 --> 00:29.375
This is Draal.

00:29.458 --> 00:32.000
For many years,
my mentor and teacher.

00:32.083 --> 00:33.917
Let's hope Tasaki was right
about that fissure

00:34.000 --> 00:36.250
being five miles deep
'cause on our present speed

00:36.333 --> 00:38.083
'it's gonna take at least
two miles to decelerate.'

00:38.167 --> 00:40.583
(Ivanova)
'We've got something.
Definitely artificial.'

00:40.667 --> 00:42.000
(Garibaldi)
Commander, you okay?

00:42.083 --> 00:43.292
(Sinclair)
Michael, you wouldn't believe.

00:43.375 --> 00:45.333
A whole new area of technology.

00:45.417 --> 00:47.875
Machines as big as buildings.

00:47.958 --> 00:49.042
What the hell?

00:49.125 --> 00:50.917
Help me

00:51.000 --> 00:52.667
or your people

00:52.750 --> 00:56.375
all your people will die.

00:56.458 --> 00:58.125
So either
she's not on Mars anymore--

00:58.208 --> 00:59.667
- She's there, alright?
- Then it's possible..

00:59.750 --> 01:01.083
That something's happened
to her.

01:01.167 --> 01:02.792
Tell the fighters
to initiate air cover

01:02.875 --> 01:04.333
'and have a full medical team
standing by'

01:04.417 --> 01:05.708
'when we arrive.'

01:05.792 --> 01:07.042
I want that med team at Bay 14

01:07.125 --> 01:08.500
in ten minutes.
I'll meet them there.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.125
We've got a ship
coming through the jumpgate.

01:10.208 --> 01:12.792
- Fine, fine.
- Mr. Garibaldi, it's big!

01:15.458 --> 01:17.333
[whooshing]

01:21.458 --> 01:23.708
[intense music]

01:25.208 --> 01:27.042
What the hell?

01:27.125 --> 01:30.000
It's an
Earth Alliance Heavy Cruiser.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.333
Babylon Control to Earth Cruiser

01:31.417 --> 01:32.667
nothing personal,
but what's going on?

01:32.750 --> 01:34.333
We didn't ask for any help.

01:34.417 --> 01:36.250
Affirmative, Babylon Control.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.667
But whether you like it or not,
you're getting it.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.625
This is Captain Ellis Pierce

01:40.708 --> 01:43.333
of the Earth Alliance
Starship Hyperion.

01:43.417 --> 01:46.167
We are assuming control
over the situation.

01:46.250 --> 01:49.250
Please stand by,
Babylon Control.

01:49.333 --> 01:50.500
We're coming in.

01:50.583 --> 01:53.667
[music continues]

01:57.917 --> 02:01.500
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

02:01.583 --> 02:04.708
ten years
after the Earth-Minbari War.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.208
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:08.292 --> 02:10.417
Its goal,
to prevent another war

02:10.500 --> 02:12.917
by creating a place
where humans and aliens

02:13.000 --> 02:15.542
could work out
their differences peacefully.

02:15.625 --> 02:18.667
It's a port of call,
home away from home

02:18.750 --> 02:20.708
for diplomats, hustlers

02:20.792 --> 02:23.792
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.125
Humans and aliens

02:25.208 --> 02:28.208
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons

02:28.292 --> 02:32.208
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.708
It can be a dangerous place

02:35.792 --> 02:38.708
but it's our last best hope
for peace.

02:38.792 --> 02:42.833
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

02:42.917 --> 02:45.125
The year is 2258.

02:45.208 --> 02:49.292
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

02:49.375 --> 02:52.417
[theme music]

03:21.625 --> 03:24.667
[music continues]

03:27.167 --> 03:29.917
[intense music]

03:34.750 --> 03:36.917
- 'How is he?'
- 'I've managed..'

03:37.000 --> 03:38.958
(Stephen)
'To stabilize his condition,
but we won't know for a while.'

03:39.042 --> 03:41.792
I'm still trying to work out
his biology.

03:41.875 --> 03:42.792
[beeping]

03:42.875 --> 03:44.667
- Sinclair.
- 'Commander.'

03:44.750 --> 03:46.125
(Ivanova)
'Captain Pierce
is coming aboard.'

03:46.208 --> 03:47.708
'He'll meet you
in the briefing room.'

03:47.792 --> 03:49.000
On my way.

03:49.083 --> 03:51.708
I want quarterly progress
reports on his condition.

03:51.792 --> 03:53.042
Will do.

03:58.458 --> 04:02.125
(computer)
'For your shopping convenience,
the Zocalo is accessible'

04:02.208 --> 04:05.083
'through all marked
transport tubes.'

04:05.167 --> 04:08.958
'Our casino features gaming
from seven systems.'

04:09.042 --> 04:10.833
'All currencies are accepted.'

04:10.917 --> 04:12.083
Fade.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.000
Cushy.

04:15.083 --> 04:17.292
All the comforts of home.

04:17.375 --> 04:19.458
It'll be a nice change of pace
for my people.

04:19.542 --> 04:22.125
Good food, some R and R
while they're stationed here.

04:22.208 --> 04:23.542
I've just gone over
the message you sent

04:23.625 --> 04:25.958
upon your arrival,
Captain Pierce.

04:26.042 --> 04:28.375
Would you like
to explain yourself?

04:28.458 --> 04:31.625
We were in hyperspace
en route to the Vegan outpost

04:31.708 --> 04:33.208
when we received
a countermand order

04:33.292 --> 04:34.917
from Earthforce Command.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.833
We were ordered to report here
and assume control.

04:37.917 --> 04:41.208
- On whose authority?
- Office of Planetary Security.

04:43.125 --> 04:44.292
They relayed your reports on

04:44.375 --> 04:47.083
what you discovered
on Epsilon 3.

04:47.167 --> 04:51.292
A whole new and potentially
revolutionary technology.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.875
Based on what you described

04:52.958 --> 04:56.292
the civilian and military
potential is staggering.

04:56.375 --> 04:58.167
We can take care of it
ourselves.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.167
For now maybe.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.708
But since
this is neutral territory

05:02.792 --> 05:05.375
every race on this station
is going to stake a claim

05:05.458 --> 05:07.250
to what you found down there.

05:07.333 --> 05:10.667
Now, my orders are to make sure
Earth gets first dibs

05:10.750 --> 05:13.708
to prevent anyone else
from sending down a team

05:13.792 --> 05:15.292
and to protect this station

05:15.375 --> 05:17.667
when the other races
get tired of being told

05:17.750 --> 05:20.833
they can't take what's ours.

05:20.917 --> 05:22.167
I don't know if you appreciate

05:22.250 --> 05:24.708
how messy
this situation can get.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.208
I appreciate the fact
that we had this situation

05:27.292 --> 05:28.583
'under control and quiet'

05:28.667 --> 05:30.833
until you blew in here
with a heavy cruiser.

05:30.917 --> 05:32.750
Now everybody's gonna wonder
what's going on.

05:32.833 --> 05:36.792
A show of force is required.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.042
If they know we're here

05:40.125 --> 05:43.500
they'll be less inclined
to start something.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.417
What's the status
of your prisoner?

05:45.500 --> 05:48.875
The patient is in Medlab.
His condition, uncertain.

05:48.958 --> 05:50.750
Why don't you go down there and
hold a gun to his head, captain?

05:50.833 --> 05:53.750
Maybe a show of force will help
in that situation, too.

05:53.833 --> 05:56.333
This isn't a backwater outpost
or bronze-tech world

05:56.417 --> 05:57.833
where you can come in,
bare your teeth

05:57.917 --> 05:59.875
'and expect everyone
to fall in line.'

05:59.958 --> 06:01.167
This is a diplomatic station

06:01.250 --> 06:02.750
and your kind
of heavy-handedness

06:02.833 --> 06:04.792
is just going to make
our job harder.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.667
This kind of help we don't need.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.167
'Enjoy the accommodations,
captain.'

06:08.250 --> 06:09.625
I'll do everything I can
to make sure

06:09.708 --> 06:11.875
your stay here is a brief one.

06:11.958 --> 06:13.250
That's all.

06:18.125 --> 06:19.833
[intense music]

06:21.625 --> 06:23.417
(woman on TV)
..would appear
that Earth Alliance President

06:23.500 --> 06:26.583
Luis Santiago is bowing
to pressure by the Earth Senate

06:26.667 --> 06:30.125
to use more force
to subdue the Mars rebellion.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.708
We've received
unconfirmed reports

06:31.792 --> 06:33.792
that elite shock troops
are already en route

06:33.875 --> 06:36.458
to staging areas
outside the capital city.

06:36.542 --> 06:40.125
Yeah! Go get 'em, boys!
Show them crummy Marsies.

06:40.208 --> 06:41.667
Hey, look. They're humans, too.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.708
Hey, they don't think so.
Why should I?

06:43.792 --> 06:46.625
They're just a bunch of
damned ingrates and crybabies.

06:46.708 --> 06:47.833
'We get taxed so they can get'

06:47.917 --> 06:50.292
'all the best
atmosphere reprocessors'

06:50.375 --> 06:51.875
water reclamation.

06:51.958 --> 06:53.125
They ought to be damn grateful

06:53.208 --> 06:55.833
instead of pulling this garbage.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.833
Okay, fine, fine. Whatever.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.750
'Ask me,
the solution's real simple.'

06:59.833 --> 07:02.167
Pump in morph gas, go in there
and break some heads.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.167
Every mother lovin' one of 'em.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.167
Teach 'em who's in charge here.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.792
'Like my granddad used to say'

07:07.875 --> 07:10.125
"Nuke 'em till they glow
and then shoot 'em in the dark."

07:10.208 --> 07:12.750
[laughs]
Oh, ah, that'd take care of 'em

07:12.833 --> 07:14.625
phew, just like magic.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.917
Magic? You wanna see magic?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.792
I got a little magic trick
for ya.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.708
I'll make your head magically
pass through the top of the bar!

07:20.792 --> 07:23.333
- Hey, let go!
- I'll need complete silence.

07:23.417 --> 07:26.000
(Garibaldi)
'Or I'll have to ask for another
volunteer from the audience.'

07:26.083 --> 07:28.167
'Let's see.
What was that magic word again?'

07:28.250 --> 07:30.917
"Shazam?" That's not it.
I'll tell you what.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.708
I'll go home and look in
my books, then I'll come back.

07:32.792 --> 07:35.292
If you're still talking trash
about killing Marsies

07:35.375 --> 07:40.167
we'll try it again and again
until we get it right. Huh?

07:42.083 --> 07:43.458
[groans]

07:45.125 --> 07:47.208
(male #1)
'I'm sorry, commander,
this decision comes'

07:47.292 --> 07:49.042
from higher
in the chain of command.

07:49.125 --> 07:51.375
There is nothing I can do.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.083
Ever since the war,
Earthforce Command

07:53.167 --> 07:56.333
has been obsessed with getting
their hands on new technology.

07:56.417 --> 07:57.750
'Now that
they have the chance--'

07:57.833 --> 08:00.292
Senator, when I assumed command
of Babylon 5

08:00.375 --> 08:02.958
I was personally assured
by President Santiago

08:03.042 --> 08:05.333
that I had final authority
over this sector.

08:05.417 --> 08:06.750
I refuse to surrender
that control

08:06.833 --> 08:08.542
without express orders
from the president.

08:08.625 --> 08:11.500
The president is rather busy
at the moment.

08:11.583 --> 08:12.792
'The revolt on the Mars Colony'

08:12.875 --> 08:15.208
is taking up
a great deal of his time.

08:15.292 --> 08:16.500
That's not my problem.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.292
At the moment,
this is my problem.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.000
As far as I'm concerned,
until I'm officially

08:20.083 --> 08:22.833
told otherwise,
this is still my jurisdiction.

08:22.917 --> 08:25.417
I don't wanna resign over this,
but I will if I have to.

08:25.500 --> 08:26.917
Alright, commander.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.292
I'll do what I can
to secure that confirmation.

08:30.375 --> 08:33.750
If that fails,
maybe I can get Captain Pierce

08:33.833 --> 08:36.125
'to accept
shared jurisdictions.'

08:36.208 --> 08:38.000
It's the best I can do for now.

08:38.083 --> 08:41.250
Commander, I will be in touch.

08:44.083 --> 08:45.667
[sighs]

08:49.333 --> 08:50.375
[beeping]

08:53.125 --> 08:54.750
- Yes?
- 'Something's happening.'

08:54.833 --> 08:56.417
(Ivanova)
'Down on Epsilon 3, commander.'

08:56.500 --> 08:57.917
'You better come take a look.'

08:58.000 --> 08:59.375
On my way.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.208
A flight of ships
departed the Hyperion

09:05.292 --> 09:07.583
a little while ago,
headed down to Epsilon 3.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.208
- Did they get through?
- Negative.

09:09.292 --> 09:11.500
Bring up tactical display.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.500
They're encountering heavy fire
from the surface batteries.

09:14.583 --> 09:15.958
'Four of the Hyperion ships'

09:16.042 --> 09:18.083
'have been disabled
in the last five minutes.'

09:18.167 --> 09:19.500
The counterattack
looks even heavier

09:19.583 --> 09:20.542
than when we went down there.

09:20.625 --> 09:21.625
I noticed the same thing.

09:21.708 --> 09:23.083
Definite escalation.

09:23.167 --> 09:24.458
They're pulling back.

09:24.542 --> 09:26.958
Commander, Captain Pierce
on the link for you.

09:27.042 --> 09:28.958
Put him through.

09:29.042 --> 09:30.458
(Sinclair)
'Captain Pierce,
what's the idea'

09:30.542 --> 09:32.458
of dispatching a team
down to the planet surface

09:32.542 --> 09:34.000
without checking with me first?

09:34.083 --> 09:35.417
Unnecessary.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.458
We had your log,
your flight pattern--

09:37.542 --> 09:39.042
But it didn't work, did it?

09:39.125 --> 09:40.667
Because you can't get
near the planet surface

09:40.750 --> 09:43.125
without a properly encoded
jamming device.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.542
What? Why wasn't I informed?

09:45.625 --> 09:47.500
- You didn't ask.
- 'Commander.'

09:47.583 --> 09:50.375
I demand you turn over
this jamming device at once.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.917
It's being repaired.
But I'll see what I can do.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.333
Babylon Control out.

09:54.417 --> 09:56.500
Commander,
we didn't use a jamming device.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.167
We don't even have
a jamming device.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.542
I know,
but he doesn't know that.

09:59.625 --> 10:00.833
With luck, it'll discourage him

10:00.917 --> 10:02.208
from sending
anymore ships down there

10:02.292 --> 10:03.625
until we finish
working this out.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.333
[alarm blaring]
What's that?

10:05.417 --> 10:07.167
That's the other thing
I wanted to tell you.

10:07.250 --> 10:09.500
We're picking up
increased seismic activity

10:09.583 --> 10:11.750
inside Epsilon 3.

10:11.833 --> 10:13.417
It started about the same time

10:13.500 --> 10:15.833
when the Hyperion ships
began their approach.

10:15.917 --> 10:17.292
But they're not natural quakes.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.167
It's a massive
artificial disruption

10:19.250 --> 10:20.583
located near the planet's core.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.458
- How serious?
- 'Serious.'

10:22.542 --> 10:24.042
And growing in magnitude.

10:24.125 --> 10:25.917
According to our projections,
if this keeps on

10:26.042 --> 10:28.875
the planet will start
to break apart from the inside

10:28.958 --> 10:30.375
until it explodes.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.542
'Commander, if that planet goes,
it'll take us with it.'

10:33.625 --> 10:36.625
The Hyperion can get out
of the way. We can't.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.375
We'll be ripped apart.

10:43.292 --> 10:45.667
(Ivanova)
'Data from our latest scan
confirms my suspicions.'

10:45.750 --> 10:47.833
Epsilon 3 is honeycombed
with passages

10:47.917 --> 10:49.917
and a network of
highly-advanced fusion reactors

10:50.000 --> 10:52.583
some of which
are five to ten miles across.

10:52.667 --> 10:55.583
The scale of it is outstanding.

10:55.667 --> 10:56.833
There's power down there
on a level

10:56.917 --> 10:58.708
that we've never even
dreamed of.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.417
For the past five hours,
we've been monitoring

11:00.500 --> 11:03.542
a gradual but definite change
in all of the fusion reactors.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.792
They're all moving
towards critical mass.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.458
- A doomsday machine.
- 'Exactly.'

11:07.542 --> 11:10.917
I'd say we have, at the most,
48 hours before they blow

11:11.000 --> 11:12.583
taking the planet and us
with them.

11:12.667 --> 11:15.333
How long would it take
to evacuate the station?

11:15.417 --> 11:17.250
We're talking a quarter million
humans and aliens.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.583
Even if we called in every ship
in the sector

11:18.667 --> 11:20.208
it'd take at least
three to five days.

11:20.292 --> 11:23.250
[sighs]
Have you informed
Captain Pierce?

11:23.333 --> 11:24.667
He insists
it's just one more reason

11:24.750 --> 11:27.083
why his people
have to go down there.

11:27.167 --> 11:28.625
Your opinion.

11:29.375 --> 11:30.417
Not a chance.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.833
This chain reaction started

11:31.917 --> 11:34.208
the last time
they tried to land down there.

11:34.292 --> 11:36.292
Now, my guess is
that the planet is booby trapped

11:36.375 --> 11:38.167
to keep it from falling
into the wrong hands.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.500
If they go down there again,
we may not have 48 hours.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.375
So why didn't it start when
the two of you went down there?

11:42.458 --> 11:46.250
At a guess, because there was
still someone running the show.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.208
- The guy you brought back?
- 'Exactly.'

11:48.292 --> 11:49.625
As long
as he remains unconscious

11:49.708 --> 11:51.333
the system keeps running
on automatic

11:51.417 --> 11:53.083
heading towards self-destruct

11:53.167 --> 11:54.417
without anyone to stop it.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.708
Alright. We'll give it
another 12 hours.

11:56.792 --> 11:58.542
See if we can find a way
around this thing.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.292
If not,
we'll evacuate the station.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.458
Try to get as many as we can
away from here.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.458
It'll be a panic. They'll
stampede the docking base.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.792
I know, we'll hold back
making an announcement

12:06.875 --> 12:08.417
as long as possible,
but you better go ahead

12:08.500 --> 12:10.458
'and tell your own people.
This could get messy.'

12:10.542 --> 12:12.708
Get something to eat and try to
catch an hour or two of sleep.

12:12.792 --> 12:16.042
We've got a long road
ahead of us.

12:16.125 --> 12:18.000
[sighs]
So if we go down there,
it blows.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.208
If we don't, it blows anyway,
just a little later.

12:20.292 --> 12:21.875
It's a good thing I'm Russian.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.208
We're used
to hopeless situations.

12:27.042 --> 12:28.750
Ah, lieutenant commander.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.625
Just the person
I've been looking for.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.083
Ambassador,
this is not a good time.

12:32.167 --> 12:35.375
No, I imagine not.
You have been holding out on me.

12:35.458 --> 12:37.000
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:37.083 --> 12:40.000
- Situation is status quo.
- Ah, of course.

12:40.083 --> 12:43.083
An Earth War Cruiser
parked alongside the station

12:43.167 --> 12:45.583
mysterious trips
to the planet beneath us

12:45.667 --> 12:48.167
rumors that you have found
someone down there

12:48.250 --> 12:49.625
and brought him back here.

12:49.708 --> 12:51.667
This to you is status quo, yes?

12:51.750 --> 12:53.958
You must lead
a very interesting life.

12:54.042 --> 12:56.708
You did find something
down there, didn't you?

12:56.792 --> 12:58.292
Something valuable, perhaps?

12:58.375 --> 13:01.292
I wish to remind you that
my government has contributed

13:01.375 --> 13:03.875
substantial amounts of money
to this station.

13:03.958 --> 13:05.667
We are entitled
to an equal share

13:05.750 --> 13:07.500
of anything you find down there.

13:07.583 --> 13:10.542
Ambassador, do you really
wanna know what's going on

13:10.625 --> 13:11.708
down there right now?

13:11.792 --> 13:14.292
Yes. Absolutely.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.875
Boom. Boom, boom, boom.

13:18.958 --> 13:21.083
Boom, boom. Boom!

13:21.167 --> 13:23.792
- Have a nice day.
- Fa!

13:23.875 --> 13:27.167
You can never get a straight
answer from anyone around here!

13:29.958 --> 13:32.958
[mumbling]

13:37.250 --> 13:38.917
I knew you would say that.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.708
[both laughing]

13:41.792 --> 13:45.500
(male #2)
'Draal, help me.'

13:46.167 --> 13:47.750
'Draal!'

13:47.833 --> 13:50.250
- Draal?
- 'Help me.'

13:51.583 --> 13:52.875
Draal?

13:52.958 --> 13:55.625
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

13:55.708 --> 13:58.583
It's strange.
I heard someone call my name.

13:59.875 --> 14:02.208
It came from this way.

14:11.292 --> 14:12.333
[beeping]

14:12.417 --> 14:13.708
Yeah, come in.

14:16.542 --> 14:18.083
Michael.

14:18.167 --> 14:21.083
Hey, Jeff. What are you doing
down in this part of town?

14:21.167 --> 14:23.583
Just thought I'd see
how you were doing.

14:23.667 --> 14:26.292
Fine, fine. Have a seat.

14:26.375 --> 14:27.875
I just made some dinner.
You want some?

14:27.958 --> 14:31.042
No, thanks. I grabbed something
in the mess hall.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.333
Michael,
I heard about the incident

14:35.417 --> 14:37.583
this afternoon in the Zocalo.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.750
The uh, magic-trick thing?

14:40.833 --> 14:44.083
- 'They file a complaint?'
- No, but they could've.

14:44.167 --> 14:45.958
Oh, I know. I know.

14:46.042 --> 14:48.917
I know, I know. It was stupid.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.625
Ah, but you didn't hear 'em.

14:50.708 --> 14:52.208
The people are dying on Mars
and it's like

14:52.292 --> 14:54.125
'some kind of damn game
to these guys.'

14:54.208 --> 14:57.083
And on top of that,
I'm worried sick about Lise.

14:57.167 --> 14:59.292
- I mean, I just snapped.
- Michael, I need you sharp.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.750
You can't go off like that.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.292
Damn it, Jeff. What the hell
am I supposed to do?

15:03.375 --> 15:06.542
I've never felt
this, this helpless before.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.625
The one woman in my whole life
who meant anything to me

15:08.708 --> 15:09.875
and she is back on Mars
somewhere.

15:09.958 --> 15:11.625
Maybe she's alive,
maybe he's dead.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.542
Either way, I can't do a thing.

15:13.625 --> 15:15.125
'The planet we're parked next to
is about to go up'

15:15.208 --> 15:17.667
like a Roman candle.
What am I supposed to do, huh?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.083
Arrest it?

15:24.083 --> 15:25.125
You know, I..

15:26.167 --> 15:28.833
I never should've let her go.
I..

15:28.917 --> 15:31.833
[sighs]
I never should have waited
this long before calling her.

15:31.917 --> 15:33.500
Then why did you?

15:38.292 --> 15:40.792
I was afraid.

15:40.875 --> 15:44.792
Afraid she'd hang up on me
and just as afraid she wouldn't.

15:44.875 --> 15:47.208
Afraid to find out
that she hated me..

15:48.250 --> 15:49.375
...that it really was all over

15:49.458 --> 15:51.667
and I could kiss my dreams
goodbye.

15:53.833 --> 15:56.083
And just as afraid
to find out that..

15:57.042 --> 15:59.167
...maybe she still loved me

15:59.250 --> 16:01.167
like I think
I still loved her.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.042
'Cause then we'd have to do
something about it

16:04.125 --> 16:06.250
and I still don't know if I can.

16:08.083 --> 16:10.083
Does any of this
make any kind of sense at all?

16:10.167 --> 16:11.917
Yeah, it does.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.083
There's some brass station
down on Mars

16:15.167 --> 16:16.250
that owe me a favor or two.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.417
I think it's about time
they paid up.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.708
One way or another, I'll get you
that clear channel to Mars.

16:21.792 --> 16:24.000
That'd be great. Thanks.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.583
It's okay. I've been there.

16:32.583 --> 16:34.000
One last thing.

16:34.833 --> 16:36.083
A favor.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.417
If we have to evacuate, you know

16:38.500 --> 16:40.542
we'll never get everyone
off the station.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.500
Ambassadors, women and children,
civilians go first.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.333
Some of the command staff will
have to stay onboard until..

16:50.000 --> 16:51.375
I'd appreciate it
if you could make sure

16:51.458 --> 16:53.750
Ivanova gets
on the last ship out.

16:53.833 --> 16:56.250
She'll want to stay, but..

16:56.333 --> 16:58.875
She's got her whole career
ahead of her.

16:58.958 --> 17:01.958
Understood, she'll be on it
if I have to drug her

17:02.042 --> 17:04.000
and toss her in
before the doors close.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.333
[chuckles]

17:06.625 --> 17:09.667
[door whirring]

17:12.833 --> 17:15.875
[intense music]

17:21.500 --> 17:24.042
[door whirring]

17:24.125 --> 17:26.958
Look, this is a restricted area.
You're not allowed in here.

17:27.042 --> 17:30.458
No. Well, he's the one.
I heard him call my name.

17:30.542 --> 17:33.458
No, no. That's quite impossible,
alright? The patient's comatose.

17:33.542 --> 17:36.750
Now, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to insist that you leave now!

17:36.833 --> 17:39.208
(male #2)
Draal! Draal..

17:39.292 --> 17:41.208
- Draal!
- Don't try to move.

17:41.292 --> 17:43.125
(Stephen)
'Don't, don't, don't move.'

17:43.208 --> 17:45.750
[man groaning]

17:47.250 --> 17:49.167
- Draal..
- Stay right there, okay?

17:49.250 --> 17:51.417
- Stay still.
- No.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.583
Draal..

17:54.042 --> 17:55.083
'...you..'

17:56.208 --> 17:57.417
...help...

17:58.625 --> 18:00.583
...planet below.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.333
Do not land.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.792
'Do not approach.'

18:06.875 --> 18:09.292
'Will explode.'

18:10.625 --> 18:13.500
Destroy you all.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.500
Without the heart..

18:18.917 --> 18:21.750
...without another..

18:21.833 --> 18:24.875
[intense music]

18:26.667 --> 18:28.333
I got your message. What's up?

18:28.417 --> 18:30.292
Dr. Franklin's reporting
the patient is awake

18:30.375 --> 18:31.708
and confirming our information.

18:31.792 --> 18:34.042
If any ships land on the planet,
it will self-destruct.

18:34.125 --> 18:35.625
- Did you tell the Hyperion?
- Yes.

18:35.708 --> 18:37.833
Unfortunately, they figured out
there's no jamming device.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.083
How can you tell?

18:39.167 --> 18:40.375
Because they're about
to launch an expedition

18:40.458 --> 18:41.708
to the planet surface.

18:41.792 --> 18:44.958
- Get Pierce on the line!
- Already done.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.542
Captain, what the hell
do you think you are doing?

18:47.625 --> 18:49.542
That planet's set to blow
if your team goes down there.

18:49.625 --> 18:50.833
We've just received
confirmation--

18:50.917 --> 18:53.042
From a source
with every reason to lie

18:53.125 --> 18:54.875
to protect what's down there.

18:54.958 --> 18:56.042
(Pierce)
'Our people
have been monitoring'

18:56.125 --> 18:57.833
the same activity you have.

18:57.917 --> 19:01.125
They assure us
we can safely land on the planet

19:01.208 --> 19:02.875
as long as nominal precautions
are taken.

19:02.958 --> 19:04.875
Damn it, captain. I've got a
quarter million people in here.

19:04.958 --> 19:06.792
I'm not gonna let you jeopardize
their lives.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.833
Commander,
it's not your decision.

19:09.917 --> 19:11.375
We're going.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.042
What are you going to do,
shoot us down?

19:13.125 --> 19:16.125
If that's what's required
to protect this station, yes.

19:17.292 --> 19:19.500
- Excuse me?
- Lieutenant commander.

19:19.583 --> 19:21.042
Put Delta and Zeta flights
on alert.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.542
Stand by for immediate launch.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.583
- Orders?
- Planetary blockade.

19:24.667 --> 19:27.458
Commander,
if you order your ships

19:27.542 --> 19:29.458
to fire on my fighters

19:29.542 --> 19:31.292
you can kiss your career
goodbye.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.833
And if you go down there,
we're dead anyway.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.583
- You're bluffing.
- Lieutenant commander.

19:37.667 --> 19:40.500
- Open fighter bay doors.
- Fighter bay doors, aye.

19:40.583 --> 19:43.333
[intense music]

19:43.417 --> 19:45.042
Stand by to launch.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.250
It's up to you, captain.

19:47.333 --> 19:50.167
As far as I'm concerned,
we've got nothing to lose.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.083
- Status?
- They're canceling the launch.

20:01.708 --> 20:03.042
Tell the fighters to stand down

20:03.125 --> 20:05.000
but keep them ready
in case we need them after all.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.792
We've got a ship
coming through the jumpgate.

20:06.875 --> 20:09.417
[whooshing]

20:12.333 --> 20:13.667
Tell them to stand by.

20:13.750 --> 20:16.792
[whirring]

20:21.583 --> 20:24.125
[intense music]

20:25.833 --> 20:27.125
We're being scanned,
they're accessing

20:27.208 --> 20:29.375
'our language
and translation files!'

20:37.875 --> 20:39.125
[sighs]

20:39.208 --> 20:40.458
Everybody alright?

20:40.542 --> 20:41.792
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.792
I think so.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.292
We've got a signal
coming through.

20:45.375 --> 20:48.958
This is Takarn.

20:49.042 --> 20:53.333
We have your language files

20:53.417 --> 20:57.708
taken to learn to speak.

20:57.792 --> 21:00.042
(Takarn)
'We have been'

21:00.125 --> 21:02.750
'500 years'

21:02.833 --> 21:06.500
searching for this place.

21:07.167 --> 21:09.125
We received

21:09.208 --> 21:11.875
its call-signal.

21:11.958 --> 21:13.958
He must be talking about
the beacon that went off.

21:14.042 --> 21:18.125
This world belongs to us.

21:19.083 --> 21:22.042
We are last

21:22.125 --> 21:24.083
of our people.

21:24.167 --> 21:28.417
Searched 500 years.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.333
We will take!

21:31.417 --> 21:36.208
Give you ten of your hours
to move aside.

21:37.208 --> 21:41.042
We do not wish to kill

21:41.125 --> 21:45.000
but we will
if you will not let us take

21:45.083 --> 21:47.125
what is ours.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.125
Open channel to them.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.542
(Pierce)
'This is the Earth Alliance'

21:50.625 --> 21:53.208
Cruiser Hyperion to intruder.

21:53.292 --> 21:55.958
This sector
is under Earth jurisdiction.

21:56.042 --> 22:00.167
Any attempt to seize this planet
by force or to launch an attack

22:00.250 --> 22:02.208
'will be met with deadly force.'

22:02.292 --> 22:06.042
You have nine hours
in which to withdraw.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.542
Worst case of testosterone
poisoning I've ever seen.

22:10.625 --> 22:13.958
Is it true this world and
its technology belongs to them?

22:14.667 --> 22:17.875
No. Outcast.

22:17.958 --> 22:19.583
Violent.

22:19.667 --> 22:22.583
My people cast them out

22:22.667 --> 22:24.667
centuries ago.

22:24.750 --> 22:27.917
Signal was not meant for them.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.417
Was put here to hide from them.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.417
Given to me

22:33.500 --> 22:36.583
when the rest of my people died.

22:36.667 --> 22:38.083
'Sacred trust.'

22:38.167 --> 22:41.708
'Legacy for the future.'

22:42.375 --> 22:45.333
I am guardian

22:45.417 --> 22:46.917
protector.

22:49.583 --> 22:52.458
I live in the heart
of the machine.

22:52.542 --> 22:54.708
We are one.

22:54.792 --> 22:57.125
'Five-hundred of your years'

22:57.208 --> 23:00.125
'have I waited in the machine.'

23:00.208 --> 23:03.375
You've been here all this time
and you haven't contacted us?

23:03.458 --> 23:05.708
Uh, no.

23:07.375 --> 23:11.208
Only listened to your people.

23:11.292 --> 23:14.125
Watched this great place
being built

23:14.208 --> 23:16.917
learned your words.

23:18.542 --> 23:22.417
Please, you must stop them.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.792
'Do not let them
take the machine.'

23:24.875 --> 23:28.792
It's not for them.
It's not for this time.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.708
Varn,
the planet is falling apart.

23:32.542 --> 23:33.625
Yes.

23:34.625 --> 23:38.417
Without guardian, fail-safe..

23:39.542 --> 23:41.208
'...destroy itself.'

23:41.292 --> 23:43.708
If it blows,
it'll kill everyone here.

23:43.792 --> 23:45.708
(Sinclair)
'Is there any way to stop it?'

23:50.042 --> 23:53.167
[sighs]
What's your prognosis?

23:53.250 --> 23:54.542
He's dying.

23:54.625 --> 23:57.000
My guess is
he's been dying for a while.

23:57.083 --> 23:59.333
(Stephen)
'That would explain
the seismic disturbances.'

23:59.417 --> 24:01.167
The more that he suffered

24:01.250 --> 24:03.167
the more
the system began to malfunction.

24:03.250 --> 24:06.167
But without him,
the planet is dying

24:06.250 --> 24:08.125
taking us right along with it.

24:13.292 --> 24:15.375
[intense music]

24:15.458 --> 24:19.833
I'm told that you two were there
when Varn regained consciousness

24:19.917 --> 24:22.042
and that he spoke to you.

24:22.125 --> 24:25.208
Yes, but he did not tell us
anything more than he told you.

24:25.292 --> 24:26.958
Would you mind telling me
what you were doing there

24:27.042 --> 24:28.542
in the first place?

24:31.250 --> 24:34.458
His spirit cried out to me
in the night.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.000
He appeared before me.

24:38.292 --> 24:41.333
Oh, so you also saw him.

24:41.417 --> 24:42.667
Yes.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.833
My guess is that the machine
is still tuned to his condition

24:46.917 --> 24:50.292
and was sending
a kind of distress signal.

24:50.375 --> 24:54.500
Well, all we can do
is hope he comes to pretty soon.

24:54.583 --> 24:55.875
We've got
a little over eight hours

24:55.958 --> 24:58.292
before all hell breaks loose
out there.

24:59.625 --> 25:02.750
[instrumental music]

25:07.667 --> 25:10.333
You know what Varn meant
by "Another."

25:11.833 --> 25:13.125
Don't you?

25:14.333 --> 25:15.417
Yes.

25:17.250 --> 25:20.708
Varn could not ask it,
could not say the words..

25:22.167 --> 25:24.083
...but it was in his eyes.

25:24.167 --> 25:28.208
He is probably forbidden
to ask directly.

25:28.292 --> 25:31.875
But the answer is there
if you have ears to hear it.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.542
And what answer is that?

25:36.458 --> 25:38.708
Ambassador Mollari.

25:38.792 --> 25:42.208
I'm astonished, Delenn. Truly.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.583
Of everyone on the station

25:43.667 --> 25:46.042
I never thought
you would hold out on me.

25:47.583 --> 25:50.500
I believe we should talk. Yes?

25:56.958 --> 25:58.917
Commander,
we have a situation here.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.125
'Where the hell have you been?'

26:00.208 --> 26:01.125
Trying to solve it.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.208
Any word from Earth Central?

26:02.292 --> 26:04.792
Negative.
They're jamming us, too.

26:04.875 --> 26:07.375
There's still time
to work this out.

26:07.458 --> 26:09.792
Commander, maybe you weren't
paying attention.

26:09.875 --> 26:13.417
They've given us an ultimatum.
Surrender or be destroyed.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.833
Now, I have no intention
of sitting here quietly.

26:15.917 --> 26:19.083
'Together, we have the
firepower. We can take them.'

26:19.167 --> 26:22.333
If we coordinate our firepower
and link our fighter squadrons

26:22.417 --> 26:23.792
we can launch
a preemptive strike

26:23.875 --> 26:25.292
and outflank them.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.208
But I can't do it
without your support.

26:28.292 --> 26:30.292
Will you commit your forces
to the battle?

26:30.375 --> 26:34.042
I don't see any other choice.
We'll be ready when you are.

26:34.125 --> 26:37.958
(Londo)
Yes, he called to me as well.

26:38.042 --> 26:40.458
Appeared to me, out of nowhere.

26:40.542 --> 26:42.542
(Delenn)
Strange.

26:42.625 --> 26:46.375
I wonder why he appeared
just to you, Draal

26:46.458 --> 26:47.667
and the commander.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.500
Perhaps because
we are most familiar

26:49.583 --> 26:52.625
with the third principle
of sentient life.

26:54.583 --> 26:56.750
You can be of great service,
ambassador

26:56.833 --> 26:59.333
if you are willing
to dare greatly.

26:59.417 --> 27:03.750
You are talking to the Centauri
who led the raid on Fralis 12.

27:03.833 --> 27:05.792
Granted it was a long time ago

27:05.875 --> 27:10.375
but perhaps it is time
to return to old habits.

27:10.458 --> 27:12.500
Ambassador..

27:12.583 --> 27:14.542
I don't think
you fully understand

27:14.625 --> 27:16.708
what Draal is asking of you.

27:17.875 --> 27:19.542
Of course I do.

27:21.667 --> 27:24.292
One of us will not return.

27:25.292 --> 27:27.875
- Yes?
- That much is certain.

27:30.667 --> 27:34.708
As a young and foolish Centauri

27:34.792 --> 27:37.417
I swore
that I would die on my feet

27:37.500 --> 27:39.042
doing something noble

27:39.125 --> 27:42.000
and brave and futile.

27:42.083 --> 27:45.875
Perhaps it was not
so wild a dream as I thought

27:45.958 --> 27:47.542
or as foolish.

27:49.708 --> 27:52.500
It is better
than waiting for the inevitable.

27:54.167 --> 27:56.833
We will go together.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.750
[indistinct chatter]

27:59.833 --> 28:01.750
We've got another ship
asking to leave.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.333
Clear them for launch ASAP.

28:03.417 --> 28:04.500
The more we get out now,
the fewer

28:04.583 --> 28:06.083
we have to evacuate later.

28:06.167 --> 28:08.708
[indistinct chatter]

28:10.125 --> 28:12.625
[whirring]

28:14.833 --> 28:16.792
(Garibaldi)
Garibaldi to C &amp; C,
somebody just grabbed

28:16.875 --> 28:18.458
the patient you brought back
from the planet.

28:18.542 --> 28:20.792
'Looks like they created
a diversion on Blue 7.'

28:20.875 --> 28:22.833
By the time my guards
got back, he was gone.

28:22.917 --> 28:24.250
Stop all outgoing traffic.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.583
It's too late, three transports
have already left

28:26.667 --> 28:29.500
and one's about
to get to the gate and..

28:29.583 --> 28:31.333
Wait a minute.
Where the hell did it go?

28:31.417 --> 28:33.958
Signal coming in
from the enemy ship.

28:34.042 --> 28:36.958
You have ignored our warnings!

28:37.042 --> 28:40.042
'You send ships to our world!'

28:40.125 --> 28:42.333
No more lies!

28:42.417 --> 28:45.542
Now we take what is ours

28:45.625 --> 28:48.375
and we stop your people!

28:48.458 --> 28:50.792
He's right. The transport's
heading down to the planet.

28:50.875 --> 28:53.875
[whirring]

28:56.125 --> 28:58.167
[zapping]

28:58.250 --> 29:02.292
They've opened fire. Secondary
gunner rays targeting my ship!

29:02.375 --> 29:05.667
I'm launching fighters.
Babylon 5, we need your support.

29:05.750 --> 29:08.458
- Launch fighters. Fire at will.
- Launch fighters!

29:08.542 --> 29:11.042
[whirring]

29:12.083 --> 29:14.583
[zapping]

29:15.917 --> 29:17.375
My God!

29:17.458 --> 29:19.667
Whoever's piloting that shuttle
is a madman!

29:19.750 --> 29:22.750
[whirring]

29:23.417 --> 29:24.875
[chuckles]

29:24.958 --> 29:27.333
Just like Fralis 12.

29:27.417 --> 29:28.833
[chuckles]

29:28.917 --> 29:31.958
[intense music]

29:32.917 --> 29:35.708

[zapping]

29:43.375 --> 29:45.750
Close blast doors.

29:45.833 --> 29:47.458
What's the position
of that transport?

29:47.542 --> 29:49.167
They're about to enter
the planet's atmosphere.

29:49.250 --> 29:51.125
This is the point where
the planet's defense system

29:51.208 --> 29:52.750
opened fire last time.

29:55.292 --> 29:58.042
Wait.
The defense system isn't firing.

29:58.125 --> 29:59.750
- It's letting them in.
- Lieutenant commander.

29:59.833 --> 30:02.208
- We got a shuttle coming out.
- I didn't authorize a launch.

30:02.292 --> 30:03.583
We've got a war going on
out here.

30:03.667 --> 30:06.583
Security to C &amp; C.
I'm in pursuit of the transport.

30:06.667 --> 30:08.000
Somebody has to bring
that guy back

30:08.083 --> 30:09.708
and since you two
are stuck in Control--

30:09.792 --> 30:11.125
Negative. It's too dangerous.

30:11.208 --> 30:12.958
Hey, if they can make it,
so can I.

30:13.042 --> 30:16.083
Look, I've got to do something,
Jeff. Beginning descent.

30:16.167 --> 30:17.542
Think I can catch them
at maximum thrust

30:17.625 --> 30:19.083
if you can buy me some cover.

30:19.167 --> 30:21.958
Tell Deltas 2 through 6
to watch Mr. Garibaldi's back.

30:22.667 --> 30:25.208
[whirring]

30:25.958 --> 30:28.958
[zapping]

30:36.708 --> 30:39.417
Who said the good old days
are gone, eh?

30:40.375 --> 30:43.458
Now, uh, landing thrusters.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.667
Landing thrusters. Hm.

30:46.542 --> 30:47.500
[exhales sharply]

30:47.583 --> 30:49.000
If I were a landing thruster

30:49.083 --> 30:52.250
which one of these would I be?

30:52.333 --> 30:53.500
[rumbling]

31:15.375 --> 31:17.167
Hyperion's forward guns
powering up.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.042
Preparing to fire. Locking on.

- Range to target?
- Closing.

32:11.125 --> 32:12.667
300 kilometers. 250.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.625
Standby, defense grid.
Prepare to fire.

32:14.708 --> 32:16.667
Alpha Flight,
take point and engage.

32:16.750 --> 32:19.042

'Affirmed, Control. Engaging.'

32:27.500 --> 32:28.792
What the..

32:33.083 --> 32:35.042
What the hell are you two
doing down here?

32:35.125 --> 32:37.542
I figured maybe we had hijackers
or tech stealers or..

32:37.625 --> 32:40.333
[rumbling]

32:40.417 --> 32:42.875
Mr. Garibaldi,
you may have noticed

32:42.958 --> 32:44.958
but things are not going well
down here.

32:45.042 --> 32:47.042
We believe we can help.

32:47.125 --> 32:50.167
[wind howling]

32:53.208 --> 32:56.917
Finished. Have created
a pocket of air for you.

33:02.958 --> 33:04.708
The machine
that controls this planet

33:04.792 --> 33:06.542
needs a mind to run it

33:06.625 --> 33:10.500
'or it will destroy itself
and Babylon 5 with it.'

33:10.583 --> 33:12.333
So you're going back in,
is that it?

33:12.417 --> 33:13.917
No. I am.

33:15.208 --> 33:17.000
I will take his place..

33:18.292 --> 33:21.375
'...in the heart
of the machine.'

33:21.458 --> 33:23.583
Fire defense grid.
Maximum range.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.792
[zapping]

33:30.250 --> 33:32.208
I can't allow this.
There has to be another way.

33:32.292 --> 33:34.125
There is no other way.

33:35.750 --> 33:37.250
Please believe me.

33:37.333 --> 33:40.542
All my life I have searched
for a way to serve others.

33:40.625 --> 33:42.542
'To me,
there is no higher calling'

33:42.625 --> 33:44.417
no greater destiny

33:44.500 --> 33:45.833
than to live for another

33:45.917 --> 33:48.667
and if necessary,
to die for another

33:48.750 --> 33:51.375
to somehow make the world
a better place.

33:53.208 --> 33:55.833
I had done all I could
on my world.

33:56.833 --> 33:59.208
I came looking for a reason

33:59.292 --> 34:01.000
a way to live out
my remaining years

34:01.083 --> 34:02.250
with direction and purpose.

34:02.333 --> 34:04.667
Here I have found it.

34:05.542 --> 34:07.500
'I will save lives.'

34:10.333 --> 34:12.292
The wonders of this place

34:12.375 --> 34:14.625
will take me centuries
to explore.

34:14.708 --> 34:17.208
Let my life have meaning.

34:18.958 --> 34:23.500
Help me to do
what we both know must be done.

34:26.750 --> 34:29.667
[intense music]

34:29.750 --> 34:32.542
[explosion]

34:32.625 --> 34:34.625
Direct hit.
Reporting damage at Cobra Bays.

34:34.708 --> 34:37.500
Hulls Blue A through C buckling,
20% power loss.

34:37.583 --> 34:38.625
One more shot like that
and they'll blowout

34:38.708 --> 34:39.875
the whole forward section.

34:39.958 --> 34:41.500
- Where's the Hyperion?
- On the other side.

34:41.583 --> 34:43.125
Enemy ship's keeping us
between them.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.000
It's coming around again.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.042
Weapon systems powering up.

34:47.125 --> 34:49.792
- They're locking on.
- This is it.

34:49.875 --> 34:52.917
[music continues]

34:56.750 --> 34:59.000
(Sinclair)
What the hell?

34:59.083 --> 35:02.000
I am sending this message
to all three parties involved

35:02.083 --> 35:04.958
in the struggle
for control of this planet.

35:05.042 --> 35:07.167
It belongs to none of you.

35:07.250 --> 35:09.667
It belongs only to itself

35:09.750 --> 35:12.167
and to the future.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.458
(Draal)
'Commander Sinclair'

35:14.542 --> 35:17.875
'the secrets buried here
must remain secrets.'

35:17.958 --> 35:21.500
They would give any race
an advantage over all others.

35:21.583 --> 35:23.833
Thus, it is in the interests
of all races

35:23.917 --> 35:27.667
that none should gain
exclusive control of it.

35:27.750 --> 35:31.083
We entrust the safekeeping
of this place

35:31.167 --> 35:34.833
to the Babylon 5
Advisory Council.

35:34.917 --> 35:38.375
'We'll rely upon your guidance,
commander'

35:38.458 --> 35:41.208
'and the enlightened
self-interest of the Council'

35:41.292 --> 35:44.458
to make sure
that this world is left alone

35:44.542 --> 35:47.125
until the time is right.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.167
If enlightened self-interest

35:51.250 --> 35:54.583
should prove insufficient
to the cause

35:54.667 --> 35:57.000
understand this

35:57.083 --> 35:59.333
the defensive systems
on this world

35:59.417 --> 36:02.000
are now fully operational.

36:02.083 --> 36:04.708
'Do not attempt
to come here again.'

36:04.792 --> 36:07.042
'Any approach will be met
with resistance.'

36:07.125 --> 36:11.708
'Any ship attempting to land
will be destroyed.'

36:11.792 --> 36:14.083
When the time is right

36:14.167 --> 36:17.333
we will be here
waiting for you

36:17.417 --> 36:20.083
but not until then.

36:22.167 --> 36:23.542
Goodbye.

36:28.208 --> 36:30.083
[indistinct chatter]

36:31.500 --> 36:32.917
Somebody better get Pierce
on the link.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.958
Commander, the enemy ship
is moving again.

36:35.042 --> 36:36.417
- It's headed toward the planet.
- What?

36:36.500 --> 36:38.042
- Didn't they get the message?
- They got it.

36:38.125 --> 36:39.542
But I don't think
they believed it.

36:39.625 --> 36:42.625
[whirring]

36:46.333 --> 36:49.333
[zapping]

36:55.917 --> 36:58.708
Delenn, we're finished here.
We should go.

37:01.042 --> 37:02.625
He's right, ambassador.

37:03.375 --> 37:04.667
I know.

37:04.750 --> 37:05.875
If I could..

37:06.792 --> 37:08.875
If I could have just a moment.

37:13.750 --> 37:16.208
You will take care of him?

37:16.292 --> 37:19.000
I have few days left to me

37:19.083 --> 37:21.958
but I will watch him
until the end.

37:22.042 --> 37:24.500
We should know very soon

37:24.583 --> 37:28.625
if the machine
has truly accepted him.

37:28.708 --> 37:30.333
How could it not?

37:33.417 --> 37:36.667
Tell me that it's a wonder
so that I may sleep

37:36.750 --> 37:39.417
when all I can see in the night
is this place.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.750
It is a wonder.

37:45.417 --> 37:48.833
The machine
will extend his life

37:48.917 --> 37:51.125
as it did for me.

37:51.208 --> 37:54.542
'He will see all the tomorrows'

37:54.625 --> 37:57.250
'hear all the songs..'

37:58.500 --> 38:01.500
...touch
the edge of the universe

38:01.583 --> 38:03.333
with his thoughts.

38:03.417 --> 38:06.208
And my thoughts
will ever be with him.

38:07.542 --> 38:10.625
I hope that he can hear them.

38:10.708 --> 38:13.917
The third principle
of sentient life

38:14.042 --> 38:16.833
is its capacity
for self-sacrifice..

38:18.000 --> 38:21.458
'...for a cause,
a loved one..'

38:22.833 --> 38:24.542
'...or for a friend.'

38:26.917 --> 38:28.583
Goodbye, dear friend.

38:30.417 --> 38:33.708
Perhaps, some day

38:33.792 --> 38:35.625
I may see you again.

38:57.917 --> 38:59.208
[intense music]

38:59.292 --> 39:00.417
(Pierce)
'We'll be putting into dock'

39:00.500 --> 39:01.750
'for repairs at Earthport.'

39:01.833 --> 39:04.167
'ETA nine days.'

39:04.250 --> 39:06.083
'With luck, they won't be
quite as eventful'

39:06.167 --> 39:08.083
'as the last couple of days.'

39:08.167 --> 39:09.917
So much for R and R.

39:10.917 --> 39:12.167
I suppose you should know

39:12.250 --> 39:13.625
communique

39:13.708 --> 39:15.125
from Earthdome.

39:15.208 --> 39:16.667
'President Santiago confirms'

39:16.750 --> 39:18.375
that you have
primary jurisdiction

39:18.458 --> 39:21.458
over the Babylon station
and this sector of space.

39:22.208 --> 39:25.083
My, uh, regrets

39:25.167 --> 39:26.667
if I exceeded my authority.

39:26.750 --> 39:29.417
Apology accepted.
Have a safe trip.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.125
Will do. Hyperion out.

39:33.083 --> 39:36.125
[whirring]

39:43.500 --> 39:45.125
Commander, we finally got
a secure line

39:45.208 --> 39:46.583
to the Mars Colony.

39:46.667 --> 39:49.292
But before you tell
Mr. Garibaldi

39:49.375 --> 39:51.458
there's something
you should know.

39:51.542 --> 39:54.042
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

39:54.125 --> 39:55.583
What?

39:55.667 --> 39:58.000
Michael, we've got
the Mars Colony relay.

39:58.083 --> 39:59.792
We've located your friend.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.458
- Is she..
- She's alive, yes.

40:01.542 --> 40:04.167
Wounded, but okay.
The doctors say she'll be fine.

40:04.250 --> 40:06.167
Oh, that's great.

40:06.250 --> 40:07.958
- Put her through?
- Coming in.

40:08.042 --> 40:09.833
And, Michael,
if you want to talk later

40:09.917 --> 40:11.625
'you know where to find me.'

40:14.667 --> 40:16.625
Michael. Hi.

40:16.708 --> 40:19.625
I hear you've been turning Mars
upside down looking for me.

40:19.708 --> 40:23.042
Well, you know me.
I had to know if you were okay.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.667
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:24.750 --> 40:27.708
Got caught in a crossfire
trying to get some food.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.875
Fighting's died down a little.

40:31.958 --> 40:33.417
Looks like
the provisional government

40:33.500 --> 40:34.583
has got the upper hand.

40:34.667 --> 40:36.750
Good. Good.

40:36.833 --> 40:38.375
Look, Lise,
these relays get kinda weird.

40:38.458 --> 40:41.167
So we don't have a lot of time.
I just wanted to say--

40:41.250 --> 40:45.000
- Michael..
- Please, let me finish.

40:45.083 --> 40:48.000
I've made a lot of mistakes
in my life.

40:48.083 --> 40:49.625
And you're one of them.

40:49.708 --> 40:53.083
I never should've left you.
I realize that now.

40:53.167 --> 40:54.833
'I've got a couple of weeks
leave coming soon'

40:54.917 --> 40:57.083
and I am gonna take it on Mars.

40:57.167 --> 40:58.833
I thought maybe we could
work things out if--

40:58.917 --> 41:01.667
Michael, I can't.

41:01.750 --> 41:03.042
Oh, if it's the job..

41:03.125 --> 41:04.542
I'm married.

41:06.208 --> 41:07.833
Oh.

41:07.917 --> 41:10.375
His name is Franz.

41:10.458 --> 41:13.833
We're expecting our first baby
in September.

41:13.917 --> 41:15.208
That's great.

41:16.792 --> 41:18.292
I'm glad for you.

41:19.417 --> 41:20.667
Really.

41:29.958 --> 41:31.583
Mr. Garibaldi.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.792
Ambassador.

41:33.875 --> 41:37.833
I see you come here also
to lose yourself in the stars.

41:38.792 --> 41:40.042
It's quiet.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.042
I like quiet.

41:47.375 --> 41:49.000
Ask you a question?

41:50.333 --> 41:52.917
Why the end run around us?

41:53.000 --> 41:54.250
When you figured out
that someone

41:54.333 --> 41:56.042
was gonna have to take
Varn's place down there

41:56.125 --> 41:58.167
why didn't you come to us
and let us handle it?

41:58.250 --> 42:01.292
Because if I had,
I know in my heart

42:01.375 --> 42:04.833
that Commander Sinclair would
be the one down there right now.

42:05.708 --> 42:08.583
He's looking for a purpose.

42:08.667 --> 42:12.125
But his destiny lies elsewhere.

42:12.208 --> 42:15.167
And Londo. How did you get him
to go along with this?

42:15.250 --> 42:20.125
An exchange of promises.
I now owe him a great favor.

42:20.208 --> 42:23.750
'He will come to collect
sooner or later.'

42:23.833 --> 42:26.042
But I think he enjoyed it.

42:26.125 --> 42:28.083
He discovered something
inside him

42:28.167 --> 42:32.250
that he had thought was buried
long, long ago.

42:32.333 --> 42:35.000
Yeah, well,
one thing I have discovered

42:35.083 --> 42:37.250
is that some things
are better left buried.

42:38.083 --> 42:39.625
Goodnight, ambassador.

42:39.708 --> 42:43.167
Franz.. What the hell
kind of a name is Franz?

42:45.292 --> 42:47.083
Goodnight, old friend.

42:49.958 --> 42:51.792
Sleep well.

42:51.875 --> 42:54.917
[instrumental music]

43:04.083 --> 43:06.667
[theme music]

43:34.583 --> 43:37.667
