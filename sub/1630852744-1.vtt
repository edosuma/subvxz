Do you know
what a principle is?

19:12.650 --> 19:17.570
A principle is something that
you see as a fundamental truth.

19:17.650 --> 19:22.450
You do something that you think
is right out of principle!

19:22.530 --> 19:26.290
That's why
I wanted to be principal.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.920
Tell your class
they can run back home

19:33.000 --> 19:34.460
and put on their pajamas.

19:34.540 --> 19:38.090
I'll hand in my resignation
this afternoon.

19:38.170 --> 19:41.340
Sir, maybe people won't lose
respect for you

19:41.430 --> 19:42.340
if you change your mind.

19:42.430 --> 19:43.720
Saying you were wrong

19:43.800 --> 19:46.930
is sometimes the strongest thing
you can do.

19:47.010 --> 19:49.310
You're totally wrong
about that.

19:49.390 --> 19:52.480
When all these people see
I caved in to their insults

19:52.560 --> 19:55.190
and their offensive
World War II comparisons,

19:55.270 --> 19:57.070
I'll be done.

19:57.150 --> 20:00.940
Then we can't put on
our pajamas. Out of principle.

20:01.030 --> 20:02.490

opposite day to look forward to.

this is your principal.

I need to inform you
that a mistake has been made.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.300
Mr. Mackey, your counselor,

20:25.390 --> 20:27.100
totally screwed up
the calendar.

20:27.180 --> 20:30.600
Today is not pajama day.
It is in fact opposite day.
