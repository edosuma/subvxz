WEBVTT

00:09.343 --> 00:12.213
Why are the Plantars
flooding our lawn?

00:12.246 --> 00:13.981
Sorry, that's on me.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.917
They've been really homesick
lately, and I thought
a swamp might cheer 'em up.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.087
They don't look very cheery.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.926
They were for a bit,
but then they weren't.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.761
So now I'm making them cookies,

00:27.795 --> 00:30.098
the answer
to all of life's problems.

00:30.131 --> 00:34.168
Anne, you can't keep giving
them things just because
you feel bad.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.504
They need to learn
how to cope on their own.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.772
Maybe you're right.
I'll go talk to them.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.876
Mmm! How did you get them
so crunchy?

00:42.910 --> 00:44.912
Oh, that's the cicadas!
Thanks, Mom!

00:47.148 --> 00:49.383
Do I smell cookies?

00:51.652 --> 00:54.955
Guys, I know you're homesick,
but I don't think
any of this is helping.

00:54.988 --> 00:57.791
Anne's right, kids.

00:57.825 --> 01:01.262
This was nice,
but let's clean this up
and get back to the village.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.963
Sorry, the what now?

01:02.996 --> 01:06.300
Why, our miniature re-creation
of Wartwood, of course!

01:08.636 --> 01:11.672
May I have
this dance, tiny Sylvia?

01:13.341 --> 01:16.110
Aw.

01:16.144 --> 01:19.113
Okay, this can't be healthy.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.951
Hey, Dr. Jan.
Tell me you've got good news.

01:23.984 --> 01:27.255
Great news, actually.
I've got a lead!

01:27.288 --> 01:31.259
One of my colleagues knows
a sting theory expert
who works in the area!

01:31.292 --> 01:32.626
Uh...
In other words,

01:32.660 --> 01:35.629
we found someone who might be
your ticket back to Amphibia.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.232
Wow! Just wait till I tell
the Plantars!

01:38.266 --> 01:40.234
I wouldn't just yet.

01:40.268 --> 01:43.771
There are a lot of loose cannons
in the scientific community,

01:43.804 --> 01:47.341
and I'd like to vet this
"Dr. Frakes" before we meet her.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.510
Okay,
let me know when you're ready,
Dr. Jan.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.944
Was that Dr. Jan?

01:50.978 --> 01:53.947
Sounded like she had news!
A lot of news!

01:53.981 --> 01:56.250
Sorry, guys.
No good news to report.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.618
Aw.
Oh, man.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.988
All right, kids,
back to the tiny village.

02:01.021 --> 02:04.525
Just kidding! Dr. Jan found
someone who might know
how to get us back to Amphibia!

02:04.558 --> 02:06.927
Holy cow!
Think they could get us home
by the weekend?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.197
So what are we waiting for?
Let's meet this wizard!

02:09.230 --> 02:11.899
Well, we can't go right now.
Dr. Jan says...

02:14.568 --> 02:16.837
that today is great!

02:16.870 --> 02:19.540
I have her name.
Let me look her up,
and we can head on over.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.375
You're the best, Anne!

02:21.409 --> 02:22.510
All right!

02:22.543 --> 02:24.778
This is fine. It's a good idea.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.014
They need a nugget.
Right, fake Wally?

02:29.317 --> 02:30.751
Oh, who asked you?

02:33.987 --> 02:37.124
According to the Internet,
our scientist works right here?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.192
Whoa.

02:45.065 --> 02:48.636
...and whoever can answer
the question gets a snack.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.670
He got snacks!

02:51.171 --> 02:54.475
Whoa. So this is where they keep
all the dark Earth magic.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.977
I can't believe we'll be
going home soon.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.248
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves. We're only here
to ask some questions.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.983
Now, stay close.
The government's
still on our tail.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.718
Hmm.

03:07.621 --> 03:11.759
I keep telling you kids,
we don't have extra snacks
back here.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.595
Oh, hello.
Are you here to see Dr. Frakes?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.430
Absolutely!
We want to meet the doctor!

03:17.598 --> 03:18.832
I mean, maybe.
No big deal.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.234
Meh.
Is she available?

03:20.268 --> 03:22.002
Only by appointment.
Sorry.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.137
Oh. Well, we tried.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.442
Wait!

03:28.476 --> 03:31.178
Actually we are reporters,

03:31.211 --> 03:36.617
and we were just wondering if
you could answer some questions
about inter-dimensional travel.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.352
Aren't you a bit young
to be a reporter?

03:38.386 --> 03:39.753
Silence, Terri!

03:39.787 --> 03:43.691
At last,
the media has caught wind
of my amazing discovery!

03:43.724 --> 03:45.092
What kind of discovery?

03:45.125 --> 03:48.462
Oh, nothing big.
Just a portal
to another dimension!

03:48.496 --> 03:50.130
Did you say portal?

03:50.163 --> 03:53.267
Now come with me!
Terri! Music!

03:57.338 --> 04:01.375
The great Dr. Frakes
may currently be stuck running
the Brainasium

04:01.409 --> 04:03.811
and looking after hordes
of snot-nosed brats,

04:03.844 --> 04:07.281
but that doesn't mean
my research has stopped!
Oh, no!

04:07.315 --> 04:09.283
Behold, Frakes Ferrofluid!

04:09.317 --> 04:11.785
Over here is an example
of a Frakes Fractal.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.154
Look over here!
My Frakes Field!

04:14.187 --> 04:17.491
Wow!
So many things named after you!

04:17.525 --> 04:20.794
Well, science is the pursuit
of naming things after yourself.

04:20.828 --> 04:23.431
- Huh. I thought it was
the pursuit of knowledge.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.598
Don't be stupid, Terri!

04:26.434 --> 04:29.403
Voilà!
The Frakes Portal Chamber!

04:30.838 --> 04:34.908
It all began a few months ago,

04:34.942 --> 04:38.479
<i>when the city was hit with
a wave of very strange energy.</i>

04:54.362 --> 04:58.098
Since then,
we've been able to repeat
the anomaly several times.

04:58.131 --> 05:02.970
But no matter
how many times I do it,
no one believes me!

05:03.003 --> 05:04.872
Everyone says that my images
are faked.

05:04.905 --> 05:08.308
Hard to get a good picture
with all that
magnetic distortion.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.180
But here today,
I will prove otherwise!

05:13.213 --> 05:16.216
Now who's ready to see me burst
through space-time?

05:16.249 --> 05:20.120
Doctor,
this process is still
very unstable and dangerous.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.222
Should we really involve
civilians?

05:22.255 --> 05:24.525
"Unstable
and dangerous."

05:24.558 --> 05:26.727
Fine, fine!
We'll let the press decide!

05:26.760 --> 05:29.296
I think one of those pictures
is Amphibia.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.465
I'm almost somewhat certain
about it!

05:31.499 --> 05:34.468
I'm not so sure, guys.
The images look pretty fuzzy.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.704
And besides,
we just came to ask questions.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.540
Okay, but can we at least look
through it?

05:39.573 --> 05:42.142
Please, Anne?
We'd be able to see home again!

05:42.175 --> 05:46.179
No! We have no idea
what will happen!
It's too dangerous!

05:48.416 --> 05:50.150
Fine! Just a peek.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.986
But then you're not allowed
to be sad for the rest
of your lives. Got it?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.054
Yeah!

05:55.389 --> 05:57.758
All right, Dr. Frakes,
let's see that portal.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.428
That's what I'm talking about,
baby!

06:09.637 --> 06:10.571
It's...

06:12.406 --> 06:13.407
It's...

06:15.709 --> 06:17.645
not Amphibia.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.023
Unfortunately,
I can only hold the portal open

06:30.057 --> 06:32.860
for about five seconds
before it collapses and--

06:32.893 --> 06:36.163
Uh, were you three
always giant talking frogs?

06:40.801 --> 06:43.403
Um, so... I can explain.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.706
We're frog people
from another dimension!

06:45.739 --> 06:47.708
We just wanna go home!

06:47.741 --> 06:49.242
I knew they weren't reporters.

06:50.978 --> 06:51.979
Hmm...

06:52.613 --> 06:54.448
Ow.
I see...

06:56.650 --> 06:58.251
Terri, clear my schedule!

06:59.352 --> 07:00.854
Frakes Field activate!

07:05.292 --> 07:09.162
"Frakes Frogs Change the World."

07:09.196 --> 07:12.399
I'll be the most famous
scientist in history,

07:12.432 --> 07:15.636
as soon as I dissect you
and catalog your organs.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.771
Come back with my frog family!

07:18.606 --> 07:20.140
Don't try to stop me, Terri!

07:20.173 --> 07:22.910
I'm not! Frakes may be
an unparalleled genius,

07:22.943 --> 07:26.313
but that doesn't mean
she can just kidnap people!
We have to stop her!

07:26.346 --> 07:29.917
Oh. Well, that's a nice turn.
Let's do this!

07:33.453 --> 07:37.057
There! The stairs!
She's heading
for the dissection lab!

07:40.994 --> 07:42.963
Snacks!

07:42.996 --> 07:45.666
Oh, no.
My granola bar
from lunch!

07:45.699 --> 07:46.800
Run, Anne!

07:46.834 --> 07:49.202
Go! I'll be fine!

07:49.236 --> 07:50.571
Ooh, snacks!

07:54.341 --> 07:55.342
Anne!

07:55.375 --> 07:57.210
Help!
Pokey things!

08:01.148 --> 08:02.950
You can't stop me, Anne!

08:02.983 --> 08:06.554
When I'm done,
everyone will know my name!

08:06.587 --> 08:08.288
You're crazy, Dr. Fink!

08:08.321 --> 08:10.057
It's Frakes!
Whatever.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.492
Not today.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.461
Dang it.
Anne!

08:14.494 --> 08:15.629
Snacks...

08:15.663 --> 08:18.666
- Here, take my key card!
- Don't you dare, Terri!

08:18.699 --> 08:23.303
One e-mail from me,
and you'll never work in any
scientific field ever again!

08:23.336 --> 08:27.440
Do you really want to risk
your entire career
for these creatures?

08:29.943 --> 08:31.511
Yep.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.082
No!

08:40.387 --> 08:42.422
Let's go!

08:42.455 --> 08:46.126
Terri, Terri.
Stop it, Terri!

08:50.798 --> 08:55.102
<i>Behold,
the baby penguin, so noble,
fluffy and precious.</i>

08:58.138 --> 09:01.609
What do we do, Anne?
She's after us
and madder than a hornet!

09:01.642 --> 09:02.676
I have an idea.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.645
Terri, take the Plantars and go.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.915
Here's a physics lesson for you,

09:07.948 --> 09:10.450
I'm bigger than you,
and I have momentum.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.119
You can't stop me!

09:12.152 --> 09:14.221
I have a lesson for you too.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.859
Cookies really are the answer
to all of life's problems.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.460
Oh.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.630
Hey, kids! Snack time!

09:22.663 --> 09:23.664
Uh...

09:24.798 --> 09:27.000
Cookies.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.905
- What? No!

09:31.939 --> 09:33.440
This is all your fault, Terri!

09:33.473 --> 09:37.811
You'll never work again,
you hear me? Never again!

09:39.947 --> 09:41.949
Good thinking!
Nice job, Anne!

09:41.982 --> 09:43.483
Any cookies left?

09:48.822 --> 09:51.825
Look, guys. I'm doing my best
to get us back to Amphibia,
okay?

09:51.859 --> 09:56.496
And I get how much you miss it,
but you gotta stop guilting me.
I can't resist!

09:56.529 --> 09:58.899
Sorry, Anne.
We should have known better.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.735
The Plantars always did have
powerful guiltin' skills.

10:01.769 --> 10:05.773
Yeah, but you cost
this poor lady her job
and nearly got dissected!

10:05.806 --> 10:07.841
I think you all actually did me
a favor.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.577
Frakes was brilliant,
but also a huge jerk.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.781
This whole thing
reminded me that science
is for helping others,

10:13.814 --> 10:15.282
not just helping yourself.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.785
And I think the portal
we'll build together

10:17.818 --> 10:20.020
will be more than enough
to get me a grant.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.288
Wait, you mean...

10:21.321 --> 10:22.455
What?

10:22.489 --> 10:25.492
Yep! I'm gonna help you
get these goobers home.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.996
Thanks, Terri.
You're good people.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.599
Hey, Terri,
can I drive your car?
Please?

10:32.632 --> 10:36.536
Aw,
just look at that face.
Well, okay.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.538
Terri, no!
