WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:06.640
Jeff: Previously on
"survivor," at the hero tribe,

00:06.674 --> 00:09.043
Chrissy was running the show
with Ben.

00:09.077 --> 00:11.645
We're in the prime position.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.315
Jeff: While Ashley and Alan
were butting heads.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.216
Are we strong or not?

00:15.249 --> 00:16.750
Dude, you are tripping.

00:16.784 --> 00:21.655
Jeff: At the healer tribe,
Jessica and Cole were loving

00:21.689 --> 00:22.623
life and sharing secrets.

00:22.656 --> 00:25.993
Joe has the idol.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.463
Jeff: At the hustler tribe,
Patrick and Lauren went after

00:29.497 --> 00:30.498
each other.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.967
I'm assuming you'll try to
vote me out tonight.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.737
Jeff: And at tribal
council, Patrick lost the

00:36.770 --> 00:37.538
battle.

00:37.571 --> 00:41.375
Patrick, the tribe has spoken.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.343
15 are left.

00:42.376 --> 00:51.085
Who will be voted out tonight?

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.200 --> 01:16.710
Jeff: Come on in, guys!

01:16.744 --> 01:19.780
Heroes and healers getting your
first look at the new hustler

01:19.813 --> 01:20.748
tribe.

01:20.781 --> 01:25.653
Patrick voted out at the last
tribal council.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.020
All right.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.123
You guys ready to get to it?

01:29.157 --> 01:29.923
Yes.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.025
Jeff: Everybody, drop your
buffs.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.194
Wow.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.763
Jeff: We're switching
tribes.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.331
Wow.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.333
Oh, my god.

01:39.367 --> 01:44.037
Jeff: I'm going to hand you
buffs.

01:44.071 --> 01:48.676
It's day nine, and we were
all starting to get a little bit

01:48.709 --> 01:53.113
comfortable, but when Jeff says,
"drop your buff," all of that

01:53.147 --> 01:55.082
gets erased, and it's a
brand-new game.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.116
Drew: All right.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.218
Shall we?

01:57.251 --> 02:00.120
Everybody reveal.

02:00.154 --> 02:04.758
Once you find your color, take a
spot on the mat.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.728
Bring you stuff with you and say
hello to your new tribe mates.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.363
Oh, my god.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.564
Bye, guys.

02:10.598 --> 02:13.867
I instantly looked over at
Cole and saw that I had a red

02:13.901 --> 02:16.237
buff and he had a red buff, too.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.440
My palms were sweating, my heart
was racing.

02:19.473 --> 02:19.907
It was awesome.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.042
Welcome, Ryan.

02:22.075 --> 02:22.876
Jeff: Wow.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.144
Big mix-up.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.013
Let's start with our first
tribe.

02:26.046 --> 02:31.018
We have two heroes together with
Ashley and Alan, two healers

02:31.051 --> 02:38.158
withydesi and Joe, and one
hustler with Devon.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.228
Desi, what do you make of this
new tribe?

02:40.261 --> 02:43.864
Looking around, I don't think
we fared too badly.

02:43.897 --> 02:46.334
The swapped worked out really
well for me.

02:46.367 --> 02:50.304
We have three of the strongest
men, and Ashley I know is a

02:50.338 --> 02:51.071
super strong swimmer.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.774
I think we're in a great
situation.

02:53.807 --> 02:58.612
Physically I don't think there's
a reason we couldn't dominate.

02:58.646 --> 03:02.250
Jeff: Okay, next group, we
have two hustlers with Ryan and

03:02.283 --> 03:07.921
Ali, two heroes, Chrissy and
j.P., roark, you're the odd

03:07.955 --> 03:09.457
person out on this tribe.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.691
Concerns or is that a
opportunity?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.560
I think it's fair to say
both.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.594
I just don't know.

03:13.627 --> 03:18.499
I'm excited to introduce these
people to the beach.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.501
I hope we can all be friends.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.271
Jeff: Go to our last tribe.

03:23.304 --> 03:27.541
We have three healers with
Jessica, Dr. Mike, and Cole, one

03:27.575 --> 03:30.678
hustler with Lauren, one hero
with Ben.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.847
Ben, what does this feel like,
because you were on a dominant

03:33.881 --> 03:35.082
tribe doing very well.

03:35.115 --> 03:38.218
Now you're a lone soldier out
here with a group of new people.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.087
Yes, sir.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.857
It looks pretty bad for me, and
what was you name again?

03:43.891 --> 03:46.126
Lauren.

03:46.159 --> 03:46.760
Lauren.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.362
We walked over here.

03:48.396 --> 03:48.896
Open arms.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.063
They gave us all hugs.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.231
I think we'll do all right.

03:51.265 --> 03:55.603
Being split up from Chrissy,
that's a shot in the foot.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.038
Things were well-oiled and
greased and we were moving.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.475
I'm going to have to put some
work inch I'm not just going to

04:01.509 --> 04:04.745
roll over and die, but my odds
at this point are real low to

04:04.778 --> 04:05.613
move forward.

04:05.646 --> 04:12.185
I'm scared.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.357
Jeff: All right.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.425
We have three new tribes.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.427
The big question is how well
will you work together?

04:19.459 --> 04:22.863
Why not right now for your first
reward challenge.

04:22.896 --> 04:23.464
Are you ready?

04:23.497 --> 04:24.598
Let's do it, Jeff.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.867
Jeff: For today's
challenge, three members of each

04:26.900 --> 04:28.769
tribe will be attached to a
braided rope.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.705
On my go you'll work together to
untangle that rope.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.174
Once you're completely
separated, you'll use the rope

04:34.207 --> 04:38.078
to hook a sled and pull it back
to you where the two remaining

04:38.111 --> 04:41.281
tribe members will use the
pieces on top to solve an

04:41.315 --> 04:44.452
upright puzzle.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.620
Want to know what you're playing
for?

04:46.654 --> 04:47.488
Yes.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.690
Jeff: Peanut butter and
jelly banana.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.091
I knew it!

04:51.124 --> 04:54.127
I knew it!

04:54.161 --> 04:56.997
[Applause]
Jeff: Peanut butter and

04:57.030 --> 04:59.733
jelly sandwiches to eat right
away, and enough peanut butter,

04:59.767 --> 05:02.936
jelly, and bread to make
sandwiches for a while, plus an

05:02.970 --> 05:05.673
individual back of potato chips
for each player.

05:05.706 --> 05:10.010
One more thing, this is a
winner-take-all challenge.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.080
No second place.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.548
Take a minute to strategize.

05:14.582 --> 05:19.052
We'll get started.

05:19.086 --> 05:19.753
All right.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.588
Here we go.

05:20.621 --> 05:25.092
First reward challenge as a new
tribe.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.194
Survivors ready?

05:27.227 --> 05:29.296
Go!

05:29.329 --> 05:30.263
Let's go, guys.

05:30.297 --> 05:33.567
Jeff: Lots of new groups.

05:33.601 --> 05:37.471
We have Alan and Ashley who have
worked together but don't know

05:37.505 --> 05:38.305
Joe.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.208
For soko we have Ryan, roark,
and j.P.

05:41.241 --> 05:44.077
Nobody knows anybody.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.147
And we have Cole, Ben, and
Lauren, where nobody knows

05:47.180 --> 05:48.315
anybody.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.652
So the first stage of this
challenge is going to come down

05:51.685 --> 05:58.992
to how well groups of strangers
can learn to communicate very

05:59.026 --> 06:01.495
fast.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.362
Me over you?

06:02.396 --> 06:03.764
Step over.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.365
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.635
Jeff: Lots of talk with
soko.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.869
Okay, okay.

06:08.902 --> 06:12.640
Jeff: Ben, Lauren, and Cole
are moving faster by the second.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.908
They've really got a rhythm
going.

06:14.942 --> 06:18.612
Now you got to get over and
under.

06:18.646 --> 06:21.715
Now the yow oo tribe in red in
the early lead.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.484
Guys, you're ahead.

06:23.517 --> 06:27.120
Jeff: The soko tribe in
yellow trying to catch up.

06:27.154 --> 06:27.888
They're free.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.257
Now you have to get over and
under.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.793
Joe, Alan, and Ashley struggle.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.528
Pop over to the other side,
Joe.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.464
On the right side.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.566
Jeff: Roark launches
herself over.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.667
Ben throws himself over.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.902
Everybody getting physical now
on "survivor."

06:41.935 --> 06:46.006
Good job, good job, one more
flip.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.709
Jeff: Moving on to the
third and final section.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.279
Soko is moving on to this third
phase of the untangling.

06:52.312 --> 06:56.016
It is still yowa in the lead.

06:56.049 --> 06:59.152
J.P., roark, and Ryan doing a
great job of working together,

06:59.186 --> 07:00.353
slowly catching yowa.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.522
You're almost there.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.690
You're almost there.

07:02.723 --> 07:03.924
Come on!

07:03.957 --> 07:07.661
Jeff: And once again Alan,
Ashley, and Joe struggle to get

07:07.695 --> 07:08.061
a rhythm.

07:08.095 --> 07:08.862
All right.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.798
You got to move a little bit
faster.

07:10.831 --> 07:15.068
Jeff: It's j.P. And Ben
side by side trying to get over

07:15.102 --> 07:17.204
that last bit of rope.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.407
J.P. Launching himself.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.311
Go one person.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.278
Soko now in the lead.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.380
Now you're trying to hook that
sled.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.582
Ben is over now.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.483
Red can go.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.451
You did all this work to
untangle the rope.

07:31.485 --> 07:35.288
Now you're going to use it to
bring those pieces to the two

07:35.322 --> 07:36.524
remaining tribe members.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.593
Alan, Joe, and Ashley are
exhausted.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.795
Nothing easy about this
challenge.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.898
All tangled up with the rope
now.

07:44.932 --> 07:53.674
All that effort and we are now
back to even.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.209
Yowa lassos it.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.711
They are back in the lead now.

07:57.745 --> 08:02.249
This is heavy, and it's taking
three people a lot of effort.

08:02.282 --> 08:02.883
You're good.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.653
Take over, puzzle solvers.

08:05.686 --> 08:09.156
Jessica and Dr. Mike working on
that puzzle while j.P. Continues

08:09.189 --> 08:12.926
the try the hook the sled for
soko.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.962
Alan now in for levu.

08:14.995 --> 08:19.199
It is an upright puzzle, not
easy to solve.

08:19.232 --> 08:22.435
Jessica and Dr. Mike have been
together in this game from day

08:22.469 --> 08:23.537
one.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.906
It would same they would have an
advantage in terms of

08:25.939 --> 08:28.408
communicating.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.677
Focus on the end.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.379
Jeff: J.P. Launches and he
has it.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.179
You got to pull.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.280
It is heavy.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.883
Together.

08:35.916 --> 08:39.653
On three, one, two, three!

08:39.687 --> 08:41.020
Jeff: Ryan giving
everything he.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.023
Can it requires all their
muscle.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.925
One, two, three, pull!

08:44.958 --> 08:46.093
Jeff: You're good.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.427
Go, puzzle solvers.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.596
You guys are done.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.865
It's now Chrissy and Ali quickly
trying to make up ground.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.200
Alan now feeling the pressure.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.636
They have no shot without those
puzzle pieces.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.670
Can't get it to hook.

08:56.704 --> 09:00.273
Jessica and Dr. Mike have a big
time advantage.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.776
But Chrissy and Ali are not
messing around.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.845
They don't know each other, but
they're working together

09:04.878 --> 09:05.679
quickly.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.649
Move this, move this, and
move this.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.684
Jeff: Yowa continues to
move forward.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.919
I'm getting it.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.921
Jeff: Alan falls short
again.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.423
Is this a sign of the new levu
tribe?

09:16.456 --> 09:18.225
Do you want somebody else to
try?

09:18.258 --> 09:20.160
Let me get one more.

09:20.193 --> 09:23.330
Jeff: Jessica and Dr. Mike
continue to make progress as

09:23.363 --> 09:24.698
Mike smashes Jessica's fingers.

09:24.732 --> 09:25.899
I'm sorry.

09:25.933 --> 09:30.838
Jeff: It would be a huge
comeback for soko if they could

09:30.871 --> 09:31.772
pull this out.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.507
Dr. Mike and Jessica arguing.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.710
Ali and Chrissy are working
together trying to close that

09:36.744 --> 09:38.011
gap.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.747
That's it, that's it.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.882
Jeff: Dr. Mike makes a
change.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.751
We have it.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.953
Jeff: Jessica makes another
change.

09:45.986 --> 09:46.987
Is this right?

09:47.020 --> 09:49.156
This would be a huge reward,
biggest of the season.

09:49.189 --> 09:54.027
They think they have it, and
they do!

09:54.061 --> 09:55.863
Yowa wins reward!

09:55.896 --> 10:09.376
Peanut butter and jelly bonanza.

10:09.409 --> 10:12.045
Yowa, congratulation, nice way
to welcome in a new tribe.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.446
Big reward.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.750
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp, enjoy the afternoon.

10:16.784 --> 10:20.287
Oh, my gosh.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.421
Jeff: Soko, levu, got
nothing for you.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.523
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp, spend the afternoon

10:23.556 --> 10:24.758
getting to know each other.

10:24.792 --> 10:28.495
Now that the heroes and the
healers and the hustlers are all

10:28.528 --> 10:30.630
switched up, the game has
stepped up a level.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.366
You have to perform.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.153
Nice.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.487
This is awesome.

10:54.521 --> 10:57.390
First initial impression of
this tribe swap, there's a

10:57.424 --> 11:00.527
little bit of comfort in our
tribe knowing that we work well

11:00.560 --> 11:05.498
together and won that pb&j.

11:05.532 --> 11:11.772
But three healers, one hustler,
and a hero, that's target pinned

11:11.805 --> 11:13.106
right on my tail.

11:13.140 --> 11:17.110
So I have to earn respect around
here and gain trust to keep my

11:17.144 --> 11:20.848
butt in the game.

11:20.881 --> 11:24.852
Obviously us three know each
other pretty well.

11:24.885 --> 11:25.819
My name is Cole.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.587
I'm from Arkansas originally.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.422
But I've been living in Wyoming.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.459
The whole tribe is getting to
know each other.

11:32.492 --> 11:37.597
I look in my chip bag and I see
to my surprise the word "secret

11:37.630 --> 11:38.198
advantage."

11:38.231 --> 11:38.732
It looked like a big chip.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.167
I almost just ate it.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.603
I'm like, well, that would have
been awful.

11:43.636 --> 11:46.006
I probably stared at it a little
too wrong.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.975
And then I realized.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.577
Jessica, you're staring at your
chips too long.

11:50.610 --> 11:57.851
And so then I rolled it up until
I can get a better read of it.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.219
Chrissy seems so nice.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.620
Chrissy is really nice.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.590
And Alan looks like he can be
a hothead.

12:03.623 --> 12:13.666
Yeah.

12:13.666 --> 12:19.907
Yeah.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.586
Right now I feel like I have
a. Of power.

12:33.620 --> 12:37.190
I have the opportunity to block
another player's vote at the

12:37.224 --> 12:39.592
next tribal council.

12:39.626 --> 12:43.296
"If you win immunity and do not
go to tribal council, you must

12:43.330 --> 12:43.730
send this to someone on the
losing tribe."

12:43.763 --> 12:44.998
Oh, my goodness.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.467
I can only imagine what kind of
chaos this could cause when it's

12:47.500 --> 12:48.235
actually used.

12:48.268 --> 12:52.940
So I feel lucky that I found it.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.842
Somebody's angel.

12:54.875 --> 13:02.149
Here you go, my friend.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.251
Hey, I found a secret advantage
in my chip bag.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.152
Really?

13:05.185 --> 13:06.319
Yeah.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.422
Long story short, if we go the
tribal council, I can block

13:09.456 --> 13:11.258
someone's vote so it doesn't
count.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.726
But it has to be used as the
next tribal council.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.030
Jessica just gave me a huge
piece of knowledge.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.566
Knowledge is power in survivor,
but I shared with Jessica that

13:19.599 --> 13:21.334
Joe had an idol.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.503
Instantly her next reaction was
to give me a hug, kiss me on the

13:23.536 --> 13:25.839
cheek, and say I trust you now,
Cole.

13:25.873 --> 13:29.642
I plan the use that same method
with other people.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.212
So I'll share a secret with
you.

13:32.245 --> 13:39.586
Jessica has an advantage, and it
cancels out one of you all's

13:39.619 --> 13:39.920
votes.

13:39.953 --> 13:40.520
Really?

13:40.553 --> 13:42.622
Yeah.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.924
Jessica's secret sounds like my
olive branch.

13:43.957 --> 13:47.694
I can extend this information
and maybe they'll see me as more

13:47.727 --> 13:49.662
trustworthy because I've chosen
to tell them something that I

13:49.696 --> 13:54.234
had no only gigs to...
Obligation to tell them in the

13:54.267 --> 13:55.368
first place.

13:55.402 --> 14:03.877
So Jessica's got an advantage in
her bag of potato chips.

14:03.911 --> 14:08.281
How can you believe that?

14:08.315 --> 14:11.651
Supposedly Jessica got an
advantage in the bottom of her

14:11.684 --> 14:14.787
chip bag, which is odd that Cole
told us that.

14:14.821 --> 14:18.625
It could be that Cole was just
telling myself and Ben to make

14:18.658 --> 14:22.429
us believe in him, and if he is,
that's great, but I'd rather

14:22.462 --> 14:24.697
just put my faith in my own
hands.

14:24.731 --> 14:37.777
So I will be using your little
secret to my advantage.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.580
I can't believe this beach.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.982
What was your beach like?

14:42.015 --> 14:42.782
Not like this.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.851
Not pretty.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.688
The new soko is myself, j.P.,
and Chrissy from the heroes.

14:48.721 --> 14:52.359
And Ryan and Ali from the
hustlers.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.528
I pretty much went from the
tribe of six healers who were

14:55.562 --> 15:00.633
super tight to the lone healer
of soko beach.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.802
So we only slept in here the
night it rained.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.472
We definitely slept in our
shelter.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.841
The swap brings such act
dayty, but I'm very lucky that

15:08.875 --> 15:12.912
Chrissy was swapped on the my
tribe because I awarded her the

15:12.946 --> 15:17.117
super immunity idol that I found
on the boat day one, and I

15:17.150 --> 15:20.520
ensured her she would not be the
one going home that night, so I

15:20.553 --> 15:23.456
have an in.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.225
I just think it's cool that
you're from jersey.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.059
I know.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.360
I think we'll be friends.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.928
I think so, too.

15:28.962 --> 15:29.963
I was glad to see you.

15:29.997 --> 15:35.835
You know, I'll tell you
something, so I found an

15:35.868 --> 15:40.373
advantage on day one on the
boat, okay, and that advantage

15:40.407 --> 15:46.313
was I could save someone at the
first tribal council.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.615
I know why you're telling me
this obviously.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.049
Yeah.

15:49.082 --> 15:49.549
Thank you.

15:49.582 --> 15:50.417
You're welcome.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.651
Why did you pick me?

15:51.684 --> 15:57.224
I just had a good vibe, and I
wanted really to play the game

15:57.257 --> 15:58.025
with you.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.526
I felt very loved when I got
it.

15:59.559 --> 16:04.564
Well, it was easy to give to
you.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.498
That is so nice.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.399
You're welcome.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.534
Thank you so much.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.502
Ryan blew my mind.

16:09.536 --> 16:12.739
He totally gave me the super
idol and seriously made me feel

16:12.772 --> 16:14.007
so loved.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.144
I thought, what was it about me
on that ship that he looked over

16:17.177 --> 16:19.912
and thought that I looked like a
kind person that he wanted to

16:19.946 --> 16:21.181
play this game with.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.516
Maybe he thought I was like his
mother an he wanted to play the

16:23.550 --> 16:24.351
game with his mother.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.552
I don't know.

16:25.585 --> 16:29.222
I give you my word, I hate to
say pay you back, but you know

16:29.256 --> 16:29.589
what I mean.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.390
I gotcha.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.892
I am absolutely thrilled.

16:32.925 --> 16:37.230
I feel very, very secure,
because now I have one more

16:37.264 --> 16:48.475
person who can help me get
further in this game.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.676
Welcome home.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.144
Thank you.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.412
Desi.

16:52.445 --> 16:52.879
Joe.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.581
Ashley.

16:54.614 --> 16:59.052
Hey, gorgeous.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.188
Right now we've got two
heroes.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.624
We have Alan and Ashley, two
healers, me and Joe, and then

17:04.656 --> 17:08.095
we've got I think the strongest
of all the hustlers in Devon in

17:08.127 --> 17:09.229
the middle.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.498
Thanks for being so
welcoming.

17:11.531 --> 17:15.268
It would be easy for the four of
us to throw Devon out, but I'd

17:15.301 --> 17:18.905
rather work with him because
he's potentially the swing boat.

17:18.938 --> 17:24.911
How you feeling?

17:24.944 --> 17:28.715
If there was one person out
of all three tribes that I did

17:28.748 --> 17:33.553
not want on my new tribe, that
would have been Alex.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.522
He's proven to be this wild car.

17:35.555 --> 17:39.159
He'll call you out and three
your name under the bus.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.861
He's already done it to me.

17:41.894 --> 17:42.829
I was really nervous.

17:42.862 --> 17:46.366
I know I got history with
you.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.402
Yeah, all this stuff between
me and you, doesn't matter.

17:49.436 --> 17:53.106
That was last chapter.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.508
Luckily I think Alan is as
nervous as I am.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.044
So even though I don't trust
him, I do trust that he doesn't

17:58.077 --> 18:02.549
want to go home.

18:02.582 --> 18:11.991
I gotcha.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.494
Ben, where is your head at
right now?

18:14.527 --> 18:19.399
I'm just trying the get
further in this game.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.867
I loved my tribe.

18:20.900 --> 18:21.834
Yeah.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.570
Thanks to the swap, it's a
whole new game.

18:23.603 --> 18:28.475
When I was with the healers, we
won every challenge, so I had no

18:28.508 --> 18:29.142
worries.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.611
But now I'm not as confident.

18:31.644 --> 18:35.047
It's true, I do have an idol,
but I'm not taking any chances.

18:35.081 --> 18:38.084
Devon is a swing vote, and I
want him on my side.

18:38.117 --> 18:45.858
The thing is, they kind of like
said, why don't we take them.

18:45.892 --> 18:49.095
I may be healer, but I'm also a
strategic player.

18:49.128 --> 18:53.500
I said, listen, Devon, they want
to vote you out, but I made it

18:53.533 --> 18:53.900
up.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.034
I don't care.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.937
This is a game of being
deceitful, so I want to do what

18:57.970 --> 18:59.739
I have to do.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.874
Was it Beth of them or just
Alan?

19:01.908 --> 19:03.142
Both.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.945
I don't know if I can really
trust Joe, but this is the first

19:05.978 --> 19:09.449
time that I've felt like, shoot,
I might be going home next.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.952
So I got to figure out my next
move or I feel like I could be

19:12.985 --> 19:23.796
in big trouble.

19:29.168 --> 19:33.039
I thought we were all going
out there.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.241
I don't know.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.943
I just think it's funny that
every time you see them, they're

19:36.976 --> 19:37.877
like this.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.146
Ben and I are a little
outnumbered here.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.350
The only way the really gain a
little bit of control would be

19:43.383 --> 19:46.486
to get Dr. Mike to join us.

19:46.519 --> 19:50.490
So if Dr. Mike doesn't know that
Jessica got the advantage, I'm

19:50.523 --> 19:53.793
going to use that against those
two.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.863
Do you think there was an
advantage yesterday?

19:56.896 --> 19:58.465
I don't know.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.499
That's a good question.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.900
I hadn't thought about it.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.769
Like where would it have been.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.070
It would have been in the
basket.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.338
Yeah, I don't know.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.907
I heard there was one in a chip
bag yesterday, and I didn't get

20:07.940 --> 20:08.775
it.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.177
You didn't get it, and he didn't
get it.

20:11.210 --> 20:11.978
And you don't know about it.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.380
Do you know what I'm saying?

20:13.413 --> 20:16.916
So Lauren says there's an
advantage in the game, which

20:16.949 --> 20:20.019
clearly somebody from my tribe
has then told her.

20:20.052 --> 20:24.223
It is clear to me it's Cole,
because Cole sometimes can't

20:24.257 --> 20:25.625
keep his mouth closed.

20:25.658 --> 20:32.499
And those things come back the
bite you in the butt.

20:32.532 --> 20:36.636
Hey, if you guys are playing
me...

20:36.669 --> 20:40.573
What are you talking about?

20:40.607 --> 20:42.575
They know about your
advantage?

20:42.609 --> 20:45.512
They know about my advantage?

20:45.545 --> 20:48.781
When he said they know about the
secret advantage, everything in

20:48.815 --> 20:54.321
my crashed, because only two
people knew, Cole, and Mike.

20:54.354 --> 20:57.557
So one of them opened their
mouth.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.726
Did you tell Lauren about the
advantage?

20:59.759 --> 21:04.030
She's like, Mike, there's an
advantage in her potato chips.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.699
How would she know about
that.

21:06.733 --> 21:10.036
In my head I'm like crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.672
Jessica is going the look at me
and think, Cole, you betrayed

21:12.705 --> 21:13.440
me.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.642
Either you or him told
Lauren.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.676
I didn't tell Lauren.

21:16.709 --> 21:20.179
I certainly wouldn't have
gone and told Lauren.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.715
That's there's no benefit to
tell her.

21:22.749 --> 21:37.296
Somebody told her.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.731
I'm so sorry.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.066
I mentioned it to Ben.

21:40.099 --> 21:43.803
I thought it would extend trust
to him.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.938
Colburned me bad.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.775
He can't even keep a secret for
a day.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.111
The same reason I told you
about the idol.

21:52.144 --> 21:56.248
Cole, but you have to protect
that knowledge a little bit.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.985
It's my prerogative on who I
tell what I have, you know?

21:59.018 --> 21:59.752
You hurt me.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.422
Whether he meant to or not, he
did.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.757
But I would never admit that to
him.

22:04.791 --> 22:09.161
When I get hurt, I always
wonder, was it me, and did I

22:09.195 --> 22:11.998
choose to form a relationship
with someone that I just

22:12.031 --> 22:12.599
shouldn't have?

22:12.632 --> 22:14.734
And that's why I got hurt.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.903
That's how I feel now with Cole.

22:16.936 --> 22:20.373
Did I make a poor decision from
the beginning, and how do I move

22:20.407 --> 22:23.776
forward in this game thinking
that?

22:23.810 --> 22:26.012
So, yeah, I had to swallow that.

22:26.045 --> 22:36.823
It hurts.

22:36.856 --> 22:46.899
Jeff: Come on in, guys!

22:46.899 --> 22:52.138
Jeff: Come on in, guys!

22:52.171 --> 22:53.205
All right.

22:53.239 --> 22:55.374
You guys ready to get to today's
immunity challenge?

22:55.408 --> 22:56.375
Yes, sir.

22:56.409 --> 22:59.579
Jeff: First things first,
take back the idols.

22:59.612 --> 23:00.046
Roark.

23:00.079 --> 23:00.813
You're welcome.

23:00.847 --> 23:06.786
Jeff: Ashley.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.088
Once again immunity back up for
grabs.

23:09.121 --> 23:12.625
For today's challenge, you're
going to race out to a large

23:12.659 --> 23:16.963
crate of puzzle piecings and
maneuver that crate through a

23:16.996 --> 23:18.898
table obstacle and under a net.

23:18.931 --> 23:22.535
Once you reach the finish,
you'll unlock your second set of

23:22.569 --> 23:24.270
puzzle pieces.

23:24.303 --> 23:28.274
You'll then arrange those pieces
so each intersection is the same

23:28.307 --> 23:29.876
color.

23:29.909 --> 23:35.114
First two tribes to finish win
immunity, safe from the vote.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.183
Losers, tribal council where
somebody will be the fourth

23:37.216 --> 23:40.419
person voted out of this game.

23:40.453 --> 23:42.188
Take a minute the strategize.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.190
We'll get started.

23:44.223 --> 23:48.728
Do it.

23:48.761 --> 23:49.395
All right.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.997
Here we go.

23:51.030 --> 23:54.901
For immunity, survivors ready?

23:54.934 --> 23:59.739
Go!

23:59.772 --> 24:03.876
That crate of puzzle pieces is
heavy.

24:03.910 --> 24:07.814
And already yawa feels the
weight of it.

24:07.847 --> 24:15.688
You now have to maneuver it
through a table obstacle.

24:15.722 --> 24:21.027
The big question is: Are your
tribe mates helping you, or are

24:21.060 --> 24:24.631
they throwing a monkey wrench
intooff plans?

24:24.664 --> 24:25.431
Go back.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.133
You, you, you.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.200
Me, me, me.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.536
Jeff: It's very close.

24:29.569 --> 24:33.272
Another hot day in Fiji.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.508
My poor brain is fried.

24:35.542 --> 24:38.110
It's levu through first.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.245
Now you're on to the net.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.279
Yellow are right on their tail.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.814
Come on!

24:41.848 --> 24:43.783
Come on, come on, come on.

24:43.816 --> 24:44.751
Ready?

24:44.784 --> 24:45.818
Here comes soko.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.720
They're entering the second
phase of this challenge.

24:47.754 --> 24:52.191
Now is when it gets dirty and
hard.

24:52.224 --> 24:53.593
You have to work together.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.828
One, two, go.

24:55.862 --> 24:59.031
Jeff: Levu doing a nice job
together.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.600
Yawa doing a great job.

25:00.633 --> 25:01.701
Yawa now in the lead.

25:01.734 --> 25:06.405
It is now soko that is
struggling to get through this.

25:06.438 --> 25:09.108
These crates weigh a ton.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.042
Yawa is through first.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.844
They won the first challenge.

25:11.878 --> 25:15.882
They would love to win the
second and send a signal.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.650
Got it, got it, got it.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.586
Jeff: Levu trying to get
through.

25:19.619 --> 25:22.188
Levu through.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.523
Yawa is untying their puzzle
pieces.

25:24.557 --> 25:25.324
Levu right on their tail.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.959
Yank 'em, yank 'em.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.260
Jeff: Here comes soko.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.095
Yank 'em.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.797
Jeff: Immunity on the line.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.331
You do not want to go home
tonight.

25:32.364 --> 25:32.699
Go.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.733
Go, go, go!

25:33.766 --> 25:37.136
Jeff: It's now Lauren on
the keys for yawa.

25:37.169 --> 25:41.173
You have to find the right keys
for both blocks.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.075
Ashley on the keys for levu.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.712
Soko taking up a lot of time.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.214
Chrissy now on the locks for
soko.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.548
Guys, guys, guys.

25:49.582 --> 25:53.953
Jeff: Lauren has the second
lock and the pieces are free now

25:53.986 --> 25:57.256
for her tribe to start working
on the puzzle.

25:57.289 --> 26:00.559
Out of nowhere Chrissy has the
second lock for soko.

26:00.593 --> 26:01.127
Go!

26:01.160 --> 26:03.495
You guys are good.

26:03.529 --> 26:06.198
Ashley still working on the
locks for levu.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.566
You got it, ash.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.202
Jeff: You are looking for
both color and the shape.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.403
This one.

26:11.437 --> 26:13.039
We got to flip that one.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.474
Jeff: They have the line up
at the crosses with the same

26:15.507 --> 26:16.609
color.

26:16.643 --> 26:19.111
Ashley struggling with the locks
for levu.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.279
It's if last one.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.182
Jeff: In times like these,
you need a little luck.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.383
It's the last one.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.084
All right.

26:25.117 --> 26:25.752
We're good.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.386
Jeff: Good job, ash.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.422
Ashley has the second lock.

26:30.456 --> 26:31.123
Ashley's work is done.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.458
I do not think that is right.

26:32.491 --> 26:34.060
There are no two ends that are
red.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.796
Jeff: Where the pieces
intersect, the colors must

26:36.829 --> 26:37.930
match.

26:37.964 --> 26:43.770
You must finish however long it
takes, otherwise it is a

26:43.803 --> 26:48.040
listening road to ruin at tribal
council.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.608
I'm lost.

26:49.642 --> 26:50.342
I'm loves.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.011
Jeff: Levu is having
trouble.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.746
"Right decisions," right
here.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.682
Red, purple.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.416
Switch 'em, switch 'em, switch
'em.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.687
Jeff: Yellow thinks they
have something.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.721
This is not right.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.055
That's in the right.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.157
Jeff: Something is not
right for soko.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.260
They got to rethink it.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.428
Guys, over here.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.429
That one is over here.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.832
That one is over here!

27:12.865 --> 27:15.134
Yes, yes!

27:15.167 --> 27:16.535
Jeff: We're flat.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.437
Are we flat?

27:18.470 --> 27:22.508
Yawa thinks they have it, and
they do.

27:22.541 --> 27:27.579
Yawa wins immunity, safe from
tribal.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.081
Looking for one more.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.649
Come on, come on.

27:30.683 --> 27:31.350
Hurry.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.685
Jeff: Levu doing a nice
job.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.020
We are neck and neck right now.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.121
It's a race to the finish.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.389
This is yellow, white,
yellow.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.025
Jeff: Soko put the last
piece.

27:39.058 --> 27:44.230
If they're right, soko thinks
they have it.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.465
And they do.

27:46.498 --> 27:54.841
Soko wins immunity, safe from
tribal council.

27:54.874 --> 27:58.010
Somebody from levu will be the
fourth person voted out of this

27:58.044 --> 27:58.444
game.

27:58.477 --> 28:00.112
Unbelievable.

28:00.146 --> 28:02.348
Jeff: Yawa,
congratulations.

28:02.381 --> 28:02.815
Immunity is yours.

28:02.849 --> 28:03.816
Thank you, sir.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.853
Jeff: Nobody going home
from you tribe.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.021
Soko, congratulations.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.290
Immunity is yours.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.926
Nobody going home from soko.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.095
Yawa, soko, grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.363
No tribal tonight.

28:17.396 --> 28:18.865
All right, levu.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.632
Somebody going home tonight,
somebody will be the fourth

28:20.666 --> 28:24.303
person voted out of "survivor:
Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers."

28:24.336 --> 28:26.105
Grab you stuff, head back to
camp.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.139
See you tonight at tribal.

28:27.173 --> 28:30.642
Tonight I have the
opportunity to block a levu

28:30.676 --> 28:32.511
player who votes at tribal
council.

28:32.544 --> 28:36.082
The goal is to help the healers,
so I'm going to disrupt the levu

28:36.115 --> 28:38.150
tribe as much as I can.

28:54.266 --> 28:57.503
The keys were such luck.

28:57.536 --> 28:58.670
We just couldn't do the
puzzle.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.272
It was the very last one I
tried.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.041
Don't even worry about that.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.376
I think everyone was just on
their own page instead of

29:04.410 --> 29:05.644
working together.

29:05.677 --> 29:06.879
We lost again.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.348
It was deflating.

29:09.381 --> 29:13.886
So you got me and ash, you got
Desi and Joe, and then you got

29:13.920 --> 29:15.054
Devon.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.589
No question Devon is a swing
vote, and whoever he goes with

29:17.623 --> 29:23.562
is going to come out on top.

29:23.595 --> 29:27.566
Devon, I don't want you to
think that because you're the

29:27.599 --> 29:31.303
odd one out you'd be target,
because the healers need to go.

29:31.337 --> 29:34.006
Listen, are you telling the
truth right now?

29:34.040 --> 29:35.574
100%?

29:35.607 --> 29:35.875
Yeah.

29:35.908 --> 29:36.876
Okay.

29:36.909 --> 29:40.279
Because Joe told me that you
want to vote me out.

29:40.312 --> 29:41.447
Really?

29:41.480 --> 29:42.248
That's [Bleeped].

29:42.281 --> 29:43.782
We don't want you to go.

29:43.816 --> 29:44.884
It makes no sense.

29:44.917 --> 29:45.684
All right.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.219
You guys didn't even consider
that?

29:47.253 --> 29:48.554
Not even for a second.

29:48.587 --> 29:49.121
All right.

29:49.155 --> 29:49.521
Wow.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.390
That is scary.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.692
To pull something like that.

29:53.725 --> 29:54.927
What a sketchy dude.

29:54.961 --> 29:58.931
When Joe told me that Ashley
wanted to vote me out, I had a

29:58.965 --> 30:02.134
gut feeling when they're going
me that whole pitch, I felt like

30:02.168 --> 30:04.937
I was being talked to by a car
salesman.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.805
I was like, this might be a lie.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.607
And now I think it was.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.076
He's a player.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.311
That's why I like talking to
you.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.779
You seem the most honest.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.015
I think I can trust ash.

30:16.048 --> 30:20.286
Alsoian... Alan seems like a
straightforward guy.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.122
Joe is a snake, and I don't like
having snakes around.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.656
Oh, my god.

30:24.690 --> 30:25.091
Let's do it.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.625
All right.

30:26.658 --> 30:35.501
Jeff:>> That just made me so
I saw Ashley and Devon in the

30:35.534 --> 30:36.735
water.

30:36.768 --> 30:40.973
I'm not sure what they said, but
at the end of it, they hugged.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.441
Really?

30:42.474 --> 30:45.344
It looks like Devon could be
playing me.

30:45.377 --> 30:48.114
I think he has this emotional
connection with Ashley.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.082
He's a surfer dude.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.084
And Ashley is all about the
beach.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.686
So I don't feel confident.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.923
He's going to come after me
first.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.658
I'm going to have to play the
idol, but if I play it tonight

30:59.691 --> 31:03.562
and they vote out Desi, then I
just wasted an idol and I'm

31:03.595 --> 31:06.498
next, so if I'm going to get one
of them out, I have to make sure

31:06.532 --> 31:15.441
they vote for me.

31:15.474 --> 31:20.212
So is this the part that we
just act like everything's cool,

31:20.246 --> 31:20.712
or...

31:20.746 --> 31:21.780
What do you mean?

31:21.813 --> 31:25.051
I'm just saying, we're going
the tribal tonight.

31:25.084 --> 31:29.989
I've been in this game for 11
games.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.857
I don't know who is part of my
alliance.

31:31.890 --> 31:35.727
I want to know, we're going to
move forward as a strong tribe,

31:35.761 --> 31:38.397
or we're going to go back to,
all right, so we started off

31:38.430 --> 31:39.898
yellow or we started off blue.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.867
Somebody got to go home
tonight, bro.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.270
That's what I'm saying, are
we not going to acknowledge.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.005
It's acknowledged.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.273
Somebody is going home tonight.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.541
I understand that, but we're
not going to talk about it at

31:49.575 --> 31:50.342
all.

31:50.376 --> 31:51.643
Who do you think should go
home?

31:51.677 --> 31:53.879
You brought it up and everybody
got to vote.

31:53.912 --> 31:54.780
Who you voting for in.

31:54.813 --> 31:55.847
All right.

31:55.881 --> 31:56.415
Let's talk about it.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.549
We had two challenges.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.717
We lost both challenges.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.853
So how do we move forward
stronger than we are right now?

32:01.887 --> 32:04.156
What do you think is going to
make us stronger?

32:04.190 --> 32:07.293
I don't mind, I'll put my
vote out there.

32:07.326 --> 32:08.327
I'm voting for Ashley.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.129
I think the strongest four is us
four.

32:10.162 --> 32:14.233
Joe wants to talk about who
we're getting rid of, and, of

32:14.266 --> 32:16.435
course, it's my name that comes
up.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.904
What makes Desi stronger than
Ashley?

32:18.937 --> 32:19.738
Please.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.274
I think Desi's stronger in
puzzles.

32:22.308 --> 32:22.841
How?

32:22.874 --> 32:27.079
What do you mean how?

32:27.113 --> 32:28.880
There's always a puzzle.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.849
You're not good at puzzles.

32:30.882 --> 32:32.451
This is total bull crap.

32:32.484 --> 32:35.654
I don't think I'm the weakest
link by any means.

32:35.687 --> 32:37.923
He has to know the more he
pisses people off, the more

32:37.956 --> 32:39.358
people want to get rid of him.

32:39.391 --> 32:43.962
I'm not voting for Ashley or
Desi.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.197
Fair enough.

32:45.231 --> 32:48.634
So I guess our name is on the
chopping block.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.402
Let your man do the math.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.772
Joe just blew up camp and in
the process he blew up both of

32:53.805 --> 32:54.573
our games.

32:54.606 --> 32:55.907
You just blew your whole spot
up.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.243
You'll see tonight.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.011
You all my be surprised tonight.

32:59.045 --> 32:59.878
I guarantee you that.

32:59.911 --> 33:02.481
That was an idiotic move.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.350
Now my name is on the chopping
block.

33:04.383 --> 33:08.020
I'm just pissed off and already
devastated and I haven't even

33:08.054 --> 33:11.423
got to tribal council.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.960
She's probably upset, but I
had to get the target off you

33:14.993 --> 33:15.894
somehow.

33:15.927 --> 33:18.997
Listen, I have an idol, okay,
so trust me.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.066
The far get is on my back.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.801
No, it's not, because you
came in too confidently.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.636
Now they're going to assume you
have the idol.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.738
Trust me, you can't think
like that.

33:26.772 --> 33:27.473
You don't know how...

33:27.506 --> 33:29.175
Then play the idol for me.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.442
What?

33:30.476 --> 33:33.879
You play the ID.L. On me and
then I got you from here on out,

33:33.912 --> 33:36.548
but at this point in time, you
just through me under the bus.

33:36.582 --> 33:40.286
I kind of screwed up, you
know, I wanted to start chaos,

33:40.319 --> 33:43.755
and I did, but it kind of
backfired a little bit, because

33:43.789 --> 33:46.458
now Desi's nervous they might
voted for her.

33:46.492 --> 33:47.926
I was like, crap.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.729
So what do you want to do?

33:50.762 --> 33:53.565
I'm telling you, I'm willing to
give you the idol, because if I

33:53.599 --> 33:55.901
don't have you, I don't have
anything.

33:55.934 --> 33:59.138
So me giving you the idol is an
extra three days for us to find

33:59.171 --> 34:00.172
some crack.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.941
It's easy of me to work crabs
together by myself.

34:02.974 --> 34:05.411
Give me a name, I'll write it
down.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.179
They're both writing my name
down?

34:07.213 --> 34:11.250
To be honest, you should
worry, if you have an idol,

34:11.283 --> 34:12.484
they're writing my name down.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.918
They're writing my name down.

34:13.952 --> 34:16.455
Now everything is up in the
air.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.091
If he pulls out the idol, one of
us are going home.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.525
He may have an idol.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.493
She may have an idol.

34:21.527 --> 34:28.567
We have to pick one.

34:28.600 --> 34:33.871
Secret advantage, do not open
until it is time to vote.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.306
No way!

34:35.341 --> 34:41.246
We're about the go to tribal,
and I discover in my bag a

34:41.280 --> 34:42.348
secret advantage.

34:42.380 --> 34:45.451
If I have a secret admirer, that
is a beautiful thing.

34:45.484 --> 34:46.784
It could be an extra vote.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.721
It could be anything, like I
have no idea.

34:49.755 --> 34:54.059
But with that and being the
swing vote, I have all of the

34:54.092 --> 35:04.203
power in my hands.

35:04.203 --> 35:09.741
Power in my hands.

35:12.478 --> 35:15.181
Jeff: For those of you who
haven't been to tribal yet, grab

35:15.214 --> 35:15.547
a torch.

35:15.581 --> 35:21.387
Get fire.

35:21.420 --> 35:24.656
This is part of the ritual at
tribal council because in this

35:24.690 --> 35:27.092
game, fire represents your life.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.562
When your fire is gone, so are
you.

35:30.596 --> 35:31.530
All right.

35:31.563 --> 35:35.267
So Alan, off the a tough start
as a new tribe.

35:35.301 --> 35:39.037
Wait, we haven't even started
and the look on your face is

35:39.070 --> 35:39.605
disgust.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.273
It's been a long day.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.874
Jeff: Let's get into it.

35:42.908 --> 35:43.875
What happened?

35:43.909 --> 35:45.877
We got back the camp and
things sparked off.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.847
Some people were a little
anxious to get tribal started.

35:48.880 --> 35:53.151
Well, we came from a loss,
and I wanted to discuss it.

35:53.185 --> 35:56.188
And unlike Alan, I just speak my
mind.

35:56.222 --> 36:00.326
Alan got upset and he's like,
you need the calm down, you're

36:00.359 --> 36:00.826
upset.

36:00.859 --> 36:01.760
I wasn't upset.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.128
I just wanted to discuss it.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.997
So I threw Ashley's name out
there.

36:06.031 --> 36:13.572
Jeff: Ashley, you could not
have liked being referred to.

36:13.605 --> 36:17.909
Jeff, I have never been
referred to the weakest link.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.044
Me had to pick someone.

36:19.077 --> 36:20.679
He went for the easiest tribes.

36:20.712 --> 36:23.549
His actions or his words might
affect him tonight.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.617
Jeff: Desi, that was a
really honest statement.

36:25.651 --> 36:26.318
Yeah.

36:26.352 --> 36:28.153
I didn't expect that out of Joe.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.421
Names were thrown out.

36:29.455 --> 36:32.224
And part of what happened was I
got thrown under the bus in the

36:32.258 --> 36:33.259
process.

36:33.292 --> 36:36.662
Jeff: Alan, is Desi's
concern fair based on what

36:36.695 --> 36:37.128
happened at camp?

36:37.162 --> 36:38.397
Absolutely.

36:38.430 --> 36:41.633
Especially when you bring in
things like talk of an idol.

36:41.667 --> 36:45.704
I'm going to be quite Frank, by
vote is between her and Joe.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.339
Jeff: Joe, this is like a
movie.

36:47.373 --> 36:48.540
It's better than a movie.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.376
Jeff: It's like that moment
where they want to get the bad

36:50.409 --> 36:52.311
guy, so they get the bad guy by
getting his wife.

36:52.344 --> 36:56.615
That's not what I wanted at
all, but on the flip side I got

36:56.648 --> 37:00.519
a lot of information from Alan
knowing he's supporting Ashley.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.721
His divide was made by him.

37:02.754 --> 37:07.659
So thank you, Alan, I appreciate
it.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.961
Jeff: Wow.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.129
Devon.

37:11.162 --> 37:12.731
Really interesting for you,
because when you first had the

37:12.764 --> 37:16.302
switch, you could argue, I'm the
odd person out, and now it

37:16.335 --> 37:20.572
sounds like we have two healers,
two hero, and you sitting in the

37:20.606 --> 37:21.707
middle.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.543
Yeah, it's out in the open
that I am the swing vote.

37:24.576 --> 37:30.148
And my vote is based on who do I
think I can work with and move

37:30.181 --> 37:31.850
forward with in this game.

37:31.883 --> 37:34.252
Jeff: So, Joe, this is a
real showdown.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.287
Yeah.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.889
I mean, Alan wants me out
because I'm not a hero.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.358
I'm not good for his game.

37:39.391 --> 37:42.594
I'm sure she's not good for his
game because we're not heroes.

37:42.628 --> 37:45.797
You can't Ben trait the hero, so
why let the heroes stay around

37:45.831 --> 37:47.132
when there's no cracks.

37:47.165 --> 37:48.634
Long-term you need to get rid of
them.

37:48.667 --> 37:49.468
It's that simple.

37:49.501 --> 37:53.739
He says the heroes can't be
broken.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.173
The healers were undefeated.

37:55.206 --> 37:58.043
If you do the numbers, do you
want to be at the bottom of

37:58.076 --> 37:59.210
seven?

37:59.244 --> 38:02.381
Joe was the person hanging off
the cliff that you see each

38:02.414 --> 38:05.851
finger peeling off because he's
scratching and clawing at

38:05.884 --> 38:06.985
whatever he can.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.887
Jeff: Devon, if everybody
here is ready to lay on the

38:08.920 --> 38:12.358
sword for their partner, the
pressure on you is enormous to

38:12.391 --> 38:14.393
make the move that moves you
forward.

38:14.426 --> 38:18.864
Well, every decision I have
made has been, is this going to

38:18.897 --> 38:24.069
further my game, and my decision
is going the stay the same every

38:24.102 --> 38:24.870
tribal council I attend.

38:24.903 --> 38:28.206
What's good for you?

38:28.239 --> 38:30.308
Jeff: It sounds like we
have a showdown about the

38:30.342 --> 38:30.809
happen.

38:30.842 --> 38:34.413
It is time to vote.

38:34.446 --> 38:39.518
Jeff, I got a little
something.

38:39.551 --> 38:44.222
It says "do not open until it is
time to vote," which is right

38:44.255 --> 38:44.723
now.

38:44.756 --> 38:45.557
Jeff: Go for it.

38:45.591 --> 38:46.992
I'm very curious.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.861
Jeff: I think everybody
else is really curious, too.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.062
Okay.

38:51.096 --> 38:56.402
It reads, "this is a secret
advantage, but it is being used

38:56.435 --> 39:03.008
against you by another player to
block your vote at tonight's

39:03.041 --> 39:08.514
tribal council."

39:08.547 --> 39:13.552
That is not an advantage.

39:13.585 --> 39:17.456
Jeff: Devon, just to make
sure we're clear, that advantage

39:17.489 --> 39:20.626
is being used to block you from
voting, meaning Devon can till

39:20.659 --> 39:22.794
be voted out, he just won't
vote.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.763
Everybody else votes, and you
can vote for anybody.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.865
Does that make sense?

39:26.898 --> 39:27.399
All right.

39:27.433 --> 39:29.635
Time to vote?

39:29.668 --> 39:42.313
Joe, you're up.

39:54.760 --> 40:01.700
Jeff: I'll go tally the
votes.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.436
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want the play it,

40:04.470 --> 40:12.243
now would be the time to do so.

40:12.277 --> 40:22.053
I got something for you,
Jeff.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.290
Can I keep it for myself or give
it to somebody?

40:25.323 --> 40:26.024
Jeff: Yes.

40:26.057 --> 40:33.665
All right.

40:33.699 --> 40:40.939
So I'll keep it for myself.

40:40.972 --> 40:42.474
Jeff: This is a hidden
immunity idol.

40:42.508 --> 40:46.244
Any votes cast for Joe will not
count.

40:46.277 --> 40:52.050
I'll read the votes.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.318
First vote Joe.

40:53.351 --> 40:57.489
Does not count.

40:57.523 --> 40:58.023
Joe.

40:58.056 --> 41:07.633
Does not count.

41:07.666 --> 41:08.667
Alan.

41:08.700 --> 41:14.239
That's one vote Alan.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.975
Fourth person voted out, Alan.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.844
You need to bring me your torch.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.378
Detroit, holler back, baby.

41:20.411 --> 41:23.314
You got it.

41:23.348 --> 41:24.516
I read your face.

41:24.550 --> 41:32.223
Thank you, girl.

41:32.257 --> 41:36.528
Jeff: Alan, the tribe has
spoken.

41:36.562 --> 41:39.197
Time for you to go.

41:39.230 --> 41:49.541
Bye, Alan.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.414
That was crazy.

41:56.447 --> 41:59.751
What the hell just happened?

41:59.785 --> 42:03.054
Jeff: Well, one of the
great truths about "survivor,"

42:03.088 --> 42:06.758
you can have all the plans you
want, "survivor" gods don't

42:06.792 --> 42:07.559
care.

42:07.593 --> 42:08.860
Grab your torches.

42:08.894 --> 42:09.327
Head back to camp.

42:09.360 --> 42:14.833
Good night.

42:18.336 --> 42:20.038
Captioning funded by CBS
and Ford.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.139
We go further, so you can.

42:21.506 --> 42:23.341
Captioned by
media access group at wgbh

42:23.374 --> 42:29.715
Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

42:29.748 --> 42:30.816
Jeff: Next time on
"survivor," to win you have to

42:30.849 --> 42:37.623
get dirty...
That is how you do it right here

42:37.656 --> 42:38.824
be ruthless.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.892
She wants to do an all-girl
alliance.

42:40.926 --> 42:42.060
Oh, she's got to go.

42:42.093 --> 42:44.195
Jeff: And have a
willingness to risk it all.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.296
It's 2-2.

42:45.330 --> 42:47.766
We are in this together.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.000
The next vote is going to rock.

42:49.034 --> 42:52.838
I don't know where Devon came
up with this thing or what he

42:52.871 --> 42:56.574
pulled, but it fell apart.

42:56.608 --> 42:59.577
I blame a lot of my fate on that
damn immunity idol.

42:59.611 --> 43:05.583
We discussed putting votes
toward Desi, but I have to give

43:05.617 --> 43:06.551
credit where credit is due.

43:06.584 --> 43:07.619
They played a hell of a game,
and they got me.
