00:09.885 --> 00:11.719
Neckbone finds
out about Sleep...

00:11.762 --> 00:12.922
he's coming for our families.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.891
Where is Neckbone?!

00:17.935 --> 00:19.560
I just wanted
to tell you I'm sorry.

00:19.603 --> 00:20.603
I got a better offer.

00:24.316 --> 00:27.818
It's important you get thisstuf.

00:27.862 --> 00:29.695
You're gonna have
to get closure.

00:29.739 --> 00:31.091
We're throwing a net
over the cop gangs.

00:31.115 --> 00:34.658
We'll drop paper on the Vipers,
Berserkers and Ravens.

00:34.702 --> 00:35.721
It's over. I'm coming home.

00:35.745 --> 00:37.619
Call me when you land, okay?

00:37.663 --> 00:39.288
They're bringing you in.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.623
SAC will get some time
off your sentence.-No! To hel!

00:41.667 --> 00:43.375
Cover!

00:43.419 --> 00:44.918
Okay, guns on the ground.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.588
I need to know
everything you gave the Feds a.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.006
Something happened to Pete.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.717
You told us we were
gonna be safe!-Calm down, bab.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.135
Tell me exactly what happened.

00:53.179 --> 00:55.179
I've got video.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.222
The kind that'll prove
you knew all about the WMD.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.849
- What the hell?
- Get out.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.203
You give me
the damn flash drive.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.436
Now!

01:09.153 --> 01:11.320
- I shouldn't have done that.
- Payback's a bitch.

01:11.363 --> 01:14.865
You are going to tell me
exactly what FBI know about my.

01:14.909 --> 01:15.909
That's enough!

01:19.914 --> 01:21.274
- Who are you?
- You're free to go.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.875
No!

01:24.919 --> 01:25.876
You shot him, not us.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.003
The man you killed
was my friend.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.632
I got a guy
I need you to look into.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.008
I've got bigger problems.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.707 --> 02:04.998
Took a minute...

02:10.464 --> 02:12.005
but here we are.

02:15.094 --> 02:16.552
I swear to God, man...

02:16.595 --> 02:17.970
I had no choice, man.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.389
Them Colombians were
gonna come in and... -Had...

02:20.432 --> 02:22.933
a better deal?

02:22.977 --> 02:24.643
You already told me that,
remember?

02:24.687 --> 02:26.603
It ain't like that, man.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.312
There's more to the story.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.356
I'm sure there is.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.529
But all that's in the past.

02:35.573 --> 02:37.447
I mean, what's done is done.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.991
Today's a new day.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.459
I'ma make this right, Bone.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.003
- I promise.
- No.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.005
You won't.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.008
I will.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.627
My name's Aria
and I worked with your dad.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.005
He was very proud of you.

05:15.316 --> 05:19.109
Round up Hammond and the others.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.033
And put this damn thing
to bed once and for all.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.284
Come on.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.013
Lourdes!

05:48.057 --> 05:50.265
Veronica! We gotta go!

05:50.309 --> 05:51.309
Lourdes?

06:03.238 --> 06:05.405
Shit.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.410
Hi! Leave a message!

06:10.454 --> 06:11.995
Where'd you go?

06:12.039 --> 06:15.374
Babe, I need to talk to you.
It's important, alright?

06:15.417 --> 06:16.417
Call me back.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.421
Where is she?

06:20.464 --> 06:23.799
I have no idea.

06:23.842 --> 06:24.903
Listen, I'm sorry about
what happened.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.636
It was uglier than
I thought it would be.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.012
- He was an FBI agent.
- I know.

06:29.056 --> 06:34.559
One that was going to
eventually testify against you.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.229
From now on, I want you
to stay the hell out of my life.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.592
And my family's life,
you hear me?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.294
You fucking just
don't get it, do you?

06:41.318 --> 06:42.984
It's you
she's running away from,

06:44.279 --> 06:45.279
not me.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.886
Where you been?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.012
Getting patched up.

07:13.392 --> 07:13.974
Long story.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.017
What's going on?

07:19.398 --> 07:21.648
Byrd's dead.

07:21.692 --> 07:22.983
And Price is gunning for us.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.193
Dead?

07:25.237 --> 07:26.237
Yeah.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.240
How?

07:32.244 --> 07:33.244
Steve?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.070
I don't want to talk about it.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.462
This is my burner's number.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.422
Get yourself one.

07:45.466 --> 07:48.341
And then what?

07:48.385 --> 07:50.825
You get out of town and wait
until I get this under control.

07:51.722 --> 07:52.842
And how you gonna do that?

07:53.682 --> 07:54.931
I'm gonna turn myself in.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.017
Try and work out
a deal for all of us.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.104
That is a shit plan.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.400
As a matter of fact,
that is the king of shit plans.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.444
It could work.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.072
The Feds love a headline.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.492
And the leader of a cop gang
pleading guilty?

08:13.535 --> 08:14.535
That's a great one.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.539
I brought this on us.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.000
We robbed that bank
to pay for Tom's lawyer.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.717
What's that?

08:30.761 --> 08:33.010
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.015
For all of us.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.149
Heads up. Some suits
just pulled up to the curb.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.993
Shit.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.077
- FBI! Open the door!
- Kick it!

09:09.550 --> 09:10.550
Don't kick my door.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.474
Hey, easy, man.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.566
Place is clear.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.109
Of course it is.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.695
Hey, y'all hear that one
about the confused bitch

09:31.738 --> 09:32.362
that walked into an empty bar?

09:32.406 --> 09:34.614
Hook him up.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.199
I don't know. It's a great joke.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.786
Look, I can offer you
the exact same deal I gave Wi.

09:39.830 --> 09:40.830
Winters is a street cop.

09:41.498 --> 09:42.998
I'm a federal agent.

09:43.041 --> 09:47.294
I can provide cover for you
in ways that she can't.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.671
So you're just gonna
have to do a little bitbetter os

09:49.715 --> 09:50.755
to make it worth my while.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.759
Jesus.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.011
- Seen enough?
- Yeah, kill it.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.393
This is big.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.686
Like I said,

10:04.730 --> 10:07.606
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.982
Only if we play it right.

10:11.403 --> 10:14.195
So what now?

10:14.239 --> 10:16.239
Get a few copies
of that flash drive made and wa.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.326
How long am I waiting?

10:19.369 --> 10:22.412
Hours? Days?

10:22.456 --> 10:23.975
If you don't hear
from me in 24 hours,

10:23.999 --> 10:26.041
take a copy of the flash drive
straight to the DOJ.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.607
It has to be far enough
above Price's head

10:30.631 --> 10:31.631
that she can't squash it.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.617
- And what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna reach out to Price.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.010
Negotiate terms face to face.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.519
What?

10:46.563 --> 10:48.438
Hello to you, too.

10:48.482 --> 10:52.609
What is it, Mom?

10:52.653 --> 10:53.318
You know I hatecalling like t,

10:53.362 --> 10:55.195
but, um...

10:55.238 --> 10:56.446
But what?

10:56.490 --> 10:57.989
I got a problem.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.410
Goddamn Stanley, he...

11:02.454 --> 11:03.286
What about him?

11:03.330 --> 11:04.996
He, um...

11:07.501 --> 11:09.209
We had an argument.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.252
And?

11:14.257 --> 11:16.007
Shit.

11:19.388 --> 11:20.388
He hit you?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.766
And he locked me
out of my damn house.

11:24.810 --> 11:27.435
I'm sitting here like a fool.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.270
Call the cops.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.981
Mom? Mom!

11:32.025 --> 11:33.983
Did you hear what I said?
Call the police.

11:35.696 --> 11:36.986
It's not right what he did.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.660
Alright, for Christ's sake.

11:43.704 --> 11:44.994
I'm coming over. Don't move.

12:08.937 --> 12:09.978
Shit.

12:11.690 --> 12:12.981
Hey! Hey! What's going on?

12:13.024 --> 12:15.984
Hey!
Ma'am, put your weapon down!

12:16.027 --> 12:17.667
- Okay, okay, relax, relax.
- Put it down!

12:21.241 --> 12:24.701
Ma'am, lay the weapon
down on the ground now!

12:24.745 --> 12:26.369
Okay, just... I'm putting it.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.455
I'm doing it.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.166
There. It's there.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.209
FBI! We have a!

13:01.239 --> 13:02.239
Mom?

13:07.579 --> 13:09.454
The hell's going on?

13:19.966 --> 13:21.674
Officer Beach,
let me see your hands!

13:21.718 --> 13:22.838
Put your hands on your head!

13:23.678 --> 13:26.012
Lace your fingers! Do it!

13:28.350 --> 13:30.016
Let's go!

13:44.825 --> 13:46.491
Spread your legs. Spread them!

13:46.535 --> 13:48.576
You know the drill.

13:48.620 --> 13:49.577
Karen Beach,
I'm placing you under arrest.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.287
You have the right
to remain silent.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.415
Anything you say can
and will be used against you in.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.375
You have the right
to an attorney.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.836
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

13:57.879 --> 13:58.711
one will be provided to you
by the courts.

13:58.755 --> 13:59.504
Do you understand these rights?

13:59.548 --> 14:02.006
Better than you do, bitch.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.383
She dropped something over here.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.009
In the bushes.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.394
Right here.

14:27.117 --> 14:28.992
That mother of yours
is a real piece of work.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.354
Nothing to say?
No smartass comment?

14:35.542 --> 14:36.542
Get her out of here.

14:52.267 --> 14:53.267
Hey!

14:54.895 --> 14:56.175
They almost got me at the house.

14:57.689 --> 14:58.187
They hit up Carl's as well.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.981
Shit.

15:01.610 --> 15:02.734
So what are we gonna do?

15:02.777 --> 15:04.527
We can't keep running like this.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.988
We don't have the cash for it.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.615
We're meeting with Tom
in a few hours.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.992
- Why?
- 'Cause he's family, that's why.

15:12.746 --> 15:13.995
He's leading the Ravens now.

15:16.708 --> 15:17.788
And we got to hear him out.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.046
Okay.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.442
How long are we gonna
be in this shit hole?

15:24.466 --> 15:26.007
Until we ain't.

15:33.141 --> 15:36.059
Hey, hey! Dump that
before it brings us heat.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.977
It's a burner, too.
They ain't up on it yet.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.030
Did you use it to call your wife?
Yeah, onc.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.903
Alright, maybe two
or three times, but she didn't.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.257
What if they're
tracking her phone looking for?

15:48.281 --> 15:51.491
They can ping the location
of incoming calls, man.

15:51.534 --> 15:52.992
Give me your phone.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.036
- Come on, Hamm.
- Don't take chances, Pete.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.200
She's not gonna know what
number to call me back at.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.878
I know you're
hurting right now...

16:03.922 --> 16:05.713
but if you call her
on that phone,

16:05.757 --> 16:06.957
you're putting us all at risk.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.095
Gimme the damn phone.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.985
You okay, Steve?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.530
Yeah. It's just with all

16:30.573 --> 16:32.293
this shit going on,
my stomach's killing me.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.370
Look, you need
some food up in ya.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.747
All of us do.

16:39.791 --> 16:40.999
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.743
We've got company.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.027
Get out of there right now. Go!

17:32.010 --> 17:34.010
Sir, stop where you are
and show me your hands.

17:41.603 --> 17:42.685
What's all this, man?

17:42.729 --> 17:43.686
Why y'all sweating me?

17:43.730 --> 17:45.688
Put your hands in the air.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.523
Y'all see this shit, right?!

17:47.567 --> 17:48.357
Look, my hands are up.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.942
They can't get no higher.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.445
Y'all always looking
for a reason to shoot a brother.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.614
Yeah, what's up with that, man?

17:54.657 --> 17:56.157
You can all see
he ain't got no gun.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.409
What did he do?
Yeah, what did I do, officer, h!

17:58.453 --> 18:00.661
What did I do?!

18:00.705 --> 18:02.455
Say it! Can't even tell me.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.915
Too black for you?

18:03.958 --> 18:05.625
- Come here.
- Is being black a crime?!

18:05.668 --> 18:07.668
Is that what I did?

18:07.712 --> 18:09.003
Man, take your hands off me!

18:10.340 --> 18:12.006
Bullshit!

18:27.398 --> 18:28.398
Where's Cole?

18:30.652 --> 18:32.193
They got him.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.987
Listen, why don't you check wi.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.591
See if knows anything about him.
Copy.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.993
You're serious?

18:43.665 --> 18:45.017
Your job is to keep
your brother safe.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.161
Don't lecture me about
being there for someone else.

18:49.838 --> 18:50.753
If I could've done something,
I would've.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.005
Got it. Thanks.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.406
Cole hasn't been brought in
for processing yet,

18:59.430 --> 19:01.347
but Beach has.

19:01.391 --> 19:04.851
Goddammit!

19:04.894 --> 19:06.054
Yeah, so much for your plan?

19:06.229 --> 19:08.938
Let's be honest,

19:08.982 --> 19:10.582
your ideas never
really pan out, do they?

19:14.154 --> 19:16.112
This is coming from the guy
who brought us heat

19:16.156 --> 19:17.466
when he went to jail
in the fucking first place.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.447
- Enough with this shit.
- Listen.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.659
You two assholes,
you killed Sleep,

19:21.703 --> 19:25.037
so I'm not really the one...

19:25.081 --> 19:26.998
who caused your mother
to be killed, am I?

19:29.961 --> 19:31.794
I loved her more
than you ever could.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.190
Yeah, you watch
your fucking mouth!

19:33.214 --> 19:35.882
- Take a shot!
- Chill the hell out, the both!

19:35.925 --> 19:37.111
- Come on!
- Hey, listen to me!

19:37.135 --> 19:38.092
Listen to me.

19:38.136 --> 19:38.926
We're gonna get
that piece of shit.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.971
But first, we gotta beat this.

19:42.015 --> 19:45.892
When I first got into this,
you both made me swear

19:45.935 --> 19:46.954
that the Ravens came
before anything.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.770
Whether it was
the department, family,

19:49.814 --> 19:51.134
- or revenge!
- Yeah, nice speech.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.318
But the both of you,
you stopped being Ravens

19:55.361 --> 19:57.121
the second you started
working with the Feds.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.926
The man showed up at my office!

20:19.969 --> 20:22.011
I know who it is!

20:23.723 --> 20:24.843
And I have it under control.

20:25.892 --> 20:26.766
No, if you had it under control,

20:26.809 --> 20:27.725
none of this would be happening.

20:27.769 --> 20:32.146
I destroyed the flash drive.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.126
And as far as that man
that tried to blackmail you,

20:34.150 --> 20:36.275
it's only a matter of time
before I arrest him.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.610
No. Look, this is too crazy.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.173
That mom showing up
at the press conference

20:39.197 --> 20:41.614
accusing me of murder
in front of everybody and now.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.032
You do what you need to do,

20:43.076 --> 20:46.827
but until this settles,
I am waiting this out in France.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.579
Running away is not a good idea.

20:48.623 --> 20:49.997
It shows consciousness of guilt.

20:51.876 --> 20:52.667
I will handle this. Trust me.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.001
I know what I'm talking about.

20:56.130 --> 20:59.674
Fine, but if any of this
blows back on me,

20:59.717 --> 21:00.837
I'm taking you down with me.

21:03.805 --> 21:06.013
Yeah, good. Give me the phone.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.020
Now get back in the trunk.

21:13.064 --> 21:16.023
No. No, no, I... I did exactly
what you told me to do.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.253
You said you were
gonna let me go.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.360
What? With the company
you've been keeping?

21:19.404 --> 21:21.362
Not a chance.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.823
Now get your sorry ass
back in the fucking trunk.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.146
Come on, come on, get in. Easy.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.328
That's it. Good boy.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.372
Goddammit.

21:43.428 --> 21:44.844
911, what's the nature of your?

21:44.887 --> 21:48.055
There's a man with a gun
at the corner of 7th and Chase.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.980
Listen, Tom's gone.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.983
You're all I got.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.098
I really don't want to do this.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.407
I don't have
a solution for that,

22:06.451 --> 22:07.451
but I admire the problem.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.995
Very funny.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.356
Listen, brother,
let's fix this shit.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.117
'Cause if not,
we're all screwed.

22:20.465 --> 22:22.006
Come here, bro.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.010
I love you, man.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.013
Get outta here.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.390
Everyone else is on the run,
but you turned yourself in.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.675
I'm delivering a message
for Hammond.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.992
He has a copy
of the flash drive.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.914
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:36.958 --> 23:38.478
Maybe the
Department of Justice will.

23:40.044 --> 23:42.503
They took a burner off me
when they put the cuffs on.

23:42.547 --> 23:43.379
You're gonna
want to get it back.

23:43.423 --> 23:44.964
Keep it close.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.049
Hammond's gonna call you
with the terms of our deal.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.388
If Hammond actually had a copy,

23:52.432 --> 23:54.472
Beach wouldn't have
tried so hard to dumpthe one sh.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.214
FBI! Hands where I can see them!

24:42.648 --> 24:43.939
Who the hell are you?

24:43.983 --> 24:47.151
Who the hell am I?
I'm the guy that's doing exactly

24:47.195 --> 24:49.035
what the guy with the gun
is telling him to do.

24:49.363 --> 24:50.363
Search him.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.586
Frank Albanese.
What are you doing here?

25:05.630 --> 25:07.963
I'm the GM of a casino.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.673
Ms. Beach has a line
of credit with us.

25:09.717 --> 25:10.837
One which is now delinquent.

25:11.594 --> 25:12.510
What's in your hand?

25:12.553 --> 25:14.678
The door was open.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.013
I thought I'd leave my card.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.858
Put your hands behind your back.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.004
Come on, is this
really necessary?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.028
Do it! Now!

25:53.052 --> 25:55.052
I want to make a deal.

25:55.096 --> 25:57.638
Whatever you're trying to do,
it won't work.

25:57.682 --> 25:58.700
I have a copy
of the flash drive.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.432
Beach kept in her apartment.

26:00.476 --> 26:03.143
No, you don't.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.107
Your friend Frank just
got caught looking for it.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.731
So, you're bluffing.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.984
Frank was just a distraction.

26:10.027 --> 26:12.736
I knew you'd have people
at Beach's apartment.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.029
That's why I sent him in there.

26:14.073 --> 26:18.033
- Bullshit.
- Is it?

26:18.077 --> 26:20.953
As soon as your guys
walked Frank to the car,

26:20.997 --> 26:22.557
I went in and got
the other flash drive.

26:59.076 --> 27:00.826
If this is some kinda
game you're running,

27:00.870 --> 27:01.452
or an attempt...
It's not a game.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.995
It's not a setup.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.291
I'm not wired.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.001
A wire can be anywhere.

27:17.178 --> 27:20.054
Feels like you're looking
for more than a wire. -I am.

27:21.641 --> 27:22.641
Where's the flash drive?

27:24.685 --> 27:25.976
- Where is it!
- It's not here.

27:26.020 --> 27:29.229
If you want it,
you're gonna haveto make a deal.

27:29.273 --> 27:33.484
You better prove you have it,
or that's not happening.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.647
Don't be an idiot, son.
She's not gonna keep her en.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.571
What are you doing here, Tom?

27:37.615 --> 27:39.573
What are you doing here?

27:39.617 --> 27:40.074
Whatever this bitch
promised you,

27:40.117 --> 27:42.368
it's all lies.

27:42.411 --> 27:43.952
It's all lies!

27:43.996 --> 27:45.515
Only way to fix it,
that's why I'm here!

27:45.539 --> 27:47.748
Don't!

27:47.792 --> 27:49.792
He's just looking for a reason.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.336
Drop the gun. Put it down, son.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.565
Or I'll drop you
where you stand.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.048
Everybody calm down!

27:56.092 --> 27:58.884
That deal you wanted,
I will make it happen.

27:58.928 --> 27:59.928
I want more than that.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.889
I want retribution.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.849
Her and Shankman
are making millions!

28:05.893 --> 28:07.601
This ain't about money!

28:07.645 --> 28:09.678
This is about our guys.

28:09.689 --> 28:10.562
Now get the hell outta here!

28:10.606 --> 28:11.980
I ain't going anywhere!

28:13.401 --> 28:15.859
Question is...

28:15.903 --> 28:17.463
are you capable
of pulling that trigger?

28:19.532 --> 28:20.989
If I have to, yeah.

28:21.033 --> 28:24.159
Shankman's given me
stock in his company!

28:24.203 --> 28:26.412
I'll split it down the middle
with both of you!

28:26.455 --> 28:27.455
What about the Ravens?

28:27.498 --> 28:29.206
We can say that
the case was tainted.

28:29.250 --> 28:32.751
That Byrd was dirty and that
everything that he wrote int

28:32.795 --> 28:34.962
was fabricated and embellished.

28:35.005 --> 28:37.005
Every one of your people
will walk free.

28:39.009 --> 28:42.052
How do we know
you're not playing us? Hu!

28:44.473 --> 28:45.597
I'll prove it.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.015
I'm gonna call Shankman
right now.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.619
We have Shankman in custody.

29:07.663 --> 29:08.996
I heard everything, Aria.

29:10.207 --> 29:11.290
Even your phone call.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.753
You have the rightto remain sil.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.036
And I'd use that if I were you.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.841
- Let's go.
- No, no!

29:20.885 --> 29:23.343
- Get off of me!
- Get her gun.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.554
Relax, Aria.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.306
It's over. It's over.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.018
It's over.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.140
When you approached me
with this,

29:39.195 --> 29:40.986
we never specified
the exact terms.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.238
We didn't have to.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.783
The terms are obvious.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.452
My guys walk, every one of them.

29:48.496 --> 29:49.912
I can't do that.

29:49.955 --> 29:53.165
I'm willing to drop charges
on you two

29:53.209 --> 29:55.501
as long as I have your word
that the both of you

29:55.544 --> 29:58.086
will testify against
the other Ravens.

29:58.130 --> 30:02.174
- Kiss my ass.
- We just proved Price is dirty.

30:02.218 --> 30:03.445
That means everything
she touched is compromised.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.636
Not everything.

30:05.679 --> 30:06.679
Some of it's salvageable.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.891
You're an idiot
if you press this.

30:10.935 --> 30:11.725
I don't need
legal advice from you.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.644
How about some career advice?

30:13.687 --> 30:15.145
Yours is over unless
you walk away.

30:15.189 --> 30:19.858
Every lawyer that reps my guys
will file a discovery motion.

30:19.902 --> 30:21.902
What Price did
will be national news

30:21.946 --> 30:24.196
unless you contain
the damage on this.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.989
It's addition
through subtraction.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.047
You lose a few cases,
but you keep your job.

30:35.376 --> 30:36.520
I can't just ignore the fact

30:36.544 --> 30:39.002
that there are gangs
inside the police force.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.881
You don't have to.

30:42.925 --> 30:45.384
Listen, you catch us
riding dirty,

30:45.427 --> 30:46.718
you make a fresh case.

30:46.762 --> 30:50.514
All we're asking for is
to wake up tomorrow morning

30:50.558 --> 30:51.558
with a clean slate.

30:56.397 --> 30:57.397
Is it a deal?

31:37.980 --> 31:39.271
Hello?

31:39.315 --> 31:42.024
Princesa?

31:42.067 --> 31:44.401
Are you okay? Where's your mom?

31:44.445 --> 31:45.445
Mom, it's Dad.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.286
What do you want, Pete?

31:54.330 --> 31:56.997
- Where are you?
- I'm not telling you.

31:58.459 --> 32:01.084
Listen, I need to see you.

32:01.128 --> 32:02.480
That's the only way to
make things right again.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.004
I wish we could.

32:04.048 --> 32:06.590
We're not coming back.
I'm not gonna raise my daughter

32:06.634 --> 32:08.008
around men like you
or my father.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.929
Don't say that.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.680
Listen to me,
it's all behind me now.

32:13.724 --> 32:14.784
The Feds are out of my life.

32:14.808 --> 32:16.934
We can go back
to the way things were.

32:16.977 --> 32:18.685
The way things were?
Living a lie?

32:18.729 --> 32:20.687
You're a gang member, Pete.

32:20.731 --> 32:21.931
The badge doesn't change that.

32:22.191 --> 32:22.981
Just...

32:23.025 --> 32:25.734
for the sake of our daughter,

32:25.778 --> 32:27.986
be a man. Stay out of our lives.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.146
Here. Say goodbye
to your father.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.536
Mom says I have to say goodbye.

32:36.580 --> 32:37.996
It's okay, princesa.

32:41.377 --> 32:43.001
I love you.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.546
I love you so much.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.507
You know that, right?

32:48.550 --> 32:50.175
Love you too, Dad.

32:50.219 --> 32:51.219
Bye.

32:53.389 --> 32:55.514
Bye, baby.

32:55.557 --> 32:56.557
Give me the phone.

33:06.193 --> 33:08.233
You're gonna be staying
with your dad from now on.

33:12.157 --> 33:15.033
What I did is wrong,
but I want you to know

33:15.077 --> 33:17.911
that everything I did,
I did for you, okay?

33:17.955 --> 33:19.395
Can you put your sister
on the phone?

33:28.549 --> 33:30.966
Okay, I understand.

33:31.010 --> 33:32.362
Tell her I will talk
to her soon, okay?

33:32.386 --> 33:34.011
I love you.

33:39.977 --> 33:42.019
I have given my life
to this bureau.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.482
And now I am losing
my pension, too.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.984
Can't I just resign?

33:50.904 --> 33:52.344
You'll serve less
than three years.

33:55.743 --> 33:56.943
And then what am I gonna do?

33:58.662 --> 33:59.995
That's for you to decide.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.998
Not me.

34:13.092 --> 34:16.762
I appreciate the confidence you.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.085
But this isn't really what I do.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.016
You're the only one I trust.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.268
Why?

34:24.730 --> 34:26.021
Because it's delicate, and...

34:27.690 --> 34:29.024
complicated.

34:29.068 --> 34:32.652
But you said yourself
that I couldn't give you closure

34:32.696 --> 34:33.815
when it came to your mother.

34:35.364 --> 34:36.989
Yeah, well.

34:38.202 --> 34:39.993
She gave me all the closure
I needed.

34:43.331 --> 34:44.331
So, now...

34:46.376 --> 34:47.576
I want to focus on the future.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.005
And that means,
you have to fix us.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.842
If you think she's messed up,

34:55.886 --> 34:58.011
wait till you get
inside my head.

35:18.367 --> 35:19.367
Hey, Pearl.

35:24.206 --> 35:25.705
Hi.

35:25.749 --> 35:28.625
Um, I made some pasta for you,

35:28.669 --> 35:31.128
and I put it by the door.

35:31.171 --> 35:32.273
You don't have to eat it
if you don't want to.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.756
Thanks.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.120
But I need the Tupperware back.

35:39.638 --> 35:40.638
How's the neighborhood?

35:43.767 --> 35:45.047
Are you sure you want to know?

35:46.770 --> 35:47.310
Yeah, I really want to know.

35:47.354 --> 35:50.188
Um, okay.

35:50.232 --> 35:53.400
So there was this suspicious car
parked down the street earlier.

35:53.443 --> 35:56.069
I saw it when I came to put
the pasta on your doorstep.

35:57.614 --> 36:00.014
You got a plate or something?
I'll run it for you tomorrow.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.033
Didn't have any plates.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.202
But the three men
that were in itwere up to no go.

36:04.246 --> 36:07.539
I'm sure about that.

36:07.583 --> 36:08.331
There were three men?

36:08.375 --> 36:11.209
Latino guys in suits.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.419
They could've been family.

36:12.462 --> 36:15.005
It was an old man
and the others were younger.

36:22.055 --> 36:24.681
So next weeksounds good to you?

36:24.725 --> 36:26.016
- Works for me.
- Perfect.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.019
Set up a meeting.

36:30.564 --> 36:32.272
Get some papers ready.

36:32.316 --> 36:33.316
And then...

36:39.823 --> 36:41.103
Excuse me.
Something has come up.

36:44.161 --> 36:45.180
Could I have a few minutes
with my friend here?

36:45.204 --> 36:46.204
Certainly.

37:17.319 --> 37:18.319
Gracias.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.001
There's a debt to be paid.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.088
But it isn't yours.

37:38.131 --> 37:41.049
The Ravens aren't
under the controlof the FBI any.

37:43.553 --> 37:44.427
They're resourceful.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.638
And to my boss,

37:46.682 --> 37:49.015
that makes them
more valuable than you.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.900
That was not part
of our agreement.

38:06.535 --> 38:07.993
Agreements change.

38:30.309 --> 38:31.309
Scared.

38:34.521 --> 38:35.521
Where's Neckbone?!

39:20.400 --> 39:21.983
Hell no.

39:23.653 --> 39:24.903
This shit is whack, man.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.988
It's garbage.

39:29.076 --> 39:30.076
I don't know.

39:33.163 --> 39:34.996
Something about it feels right.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.644
You've been playing it
real smart, man.

39:42.923 --> 39:44.243
Rolling without a crew
has made it

39:44.800 --> 39:45.382
a hell of a lot
harder to find you.

39:45.425 --> 39:48.968
But find you we did.

40:04.528 --> 40:05.528
You ain't running!

40:05.946 --> 40:09.114
Not this time.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.366
You wanna get away,
your best bet is to man up.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.992
Pull that gun.

40:25.632 --> 40:27.006
Man, y'all ain't shit.

40:28.593 --> 40:31.010
Yeah, I see what's up.

40:33.181 --> 40:36.057
There's too many
witnesses out thereso you need.

40:37.978 --> 40:39.418
And I damn sure
ain't giving you one.

40:40.647 --> 40:41.980
So I surrender, assholes.

40:44.526 --> 40:45.984
Arrest me, officers.

40:50.657 --> 40:51.990
That's a real smart play.

40:53.368 --> 40:54.951
You know...

40:54.995 --> 40:58.037
I wish your little brother
would've done the same.

41:05.547 --> 41:06.547
I can't lie though.

41:15.140 --> 41:18.016
Would've been kinda
poetic to use this on you.

41:24.357 --> 41:25.357
Right here.

41:38.288 --> 41:39.996
Come on!
