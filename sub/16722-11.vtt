00:21.588 --> 00:23.656
Will the burger be hot enough?

00:23.690 --> 00:25.958
Hot enough to kill
the deadly bacteria?

00:25.993 --> 00:28.644
Or is it so cool
that I will shut you down?

00:28.679 --> 00:31.597
One sixty-three,
one sixty-four...

00:32.598 --> 00:33.933
One sixty-five.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.785
Hot patty. It's safe.
Damn it!

00:35.819 --> 00:37.720
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:37.721 --> 00:39.388
Grade-A ground beef.

00:39.389 --> 00:41.374
Meaning we dropped it on the ground.
Louise.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.242
Are we done here, Hugo?
Almost.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.811
There's just
the little matter

00:44.812 --> 00:46.546
of your handwashing
certification.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.798
I don't see it
prominently displayed anywhere.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.250
Come on, nobody needs to be
certified in handwashing.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.753
Yeah! Hands off my hands,
government!

00:53.787 --> 00:55.171
If you wish to
remain open,

00:55.172 --> 00:56.639
you will attend
a one day seminar

00:56.640 --> 00:59.475
exploring the 32 steps of
proper hand sanitation.

00:59.510 --> 01:00.686
I'm not taking that seminar.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.078
Not before you watch

01:02.079 --> 01:03.813
- the introductory DVD, you're not.
- Ugh.

01:03.814 --> 01:07.467
- Come on, Hugo.
- And here's your "C" rating.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.552
Which will remain in your
window until you graduate.

01:09.586 --> 01:12.321
What?!
Hugo, you're an awful man.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.556
Uh, wrong, Bob.

01:13.557 --> 01:15.525
I'm a "lawful" man.

01:15.559 --> 01:16.826
Falafel man.

01:16.827 --> 01:17.927
- Waffle man.
- Omelettes.

01:17.928 --> 01:19.162
Am I doing it right?

01:19.196 --> 01:20.539
We should get
going, Hugo.

01:20.564 --> 01:22.198
Who're you going to
harass next, guys?

01:22.232 --> 01:23.766
Well, Bob, if you must know,

01:23.767 --> 01:25.368
perhaps you've heard
our town is now home

01:25.369 --> 01:26.969
to a disgusting nude beach?

01:27.004 --> 01:29.038
There've been reports of
vendors there serving food

01:29.039 --> 01:30.706
while n-n... naked.

01:30.741 --> 01:32.808
That's how the vendors
served food in the Bible.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.544
- Don't drag religion into this.
- Sorry.

01:34.545 --> 01:36.062
So long, Bob.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.664
Get certified or that "C"
will stand for "closed."

01:40.584 --> 01:41.884
Hi. I'm Andre Royo.

01:41.885 --> 01:43.386
I played Bubbles

01:43.387 --> 01:45.221
on the critically acclaimed
series The Wire.

01:45.222 --> 01:47.790
Today I'm here to talk about
a different kind of bubbles.

01:47.791 --> 01:49.058
Soap bubbles.

01:49.059 --> 01:50.693
When washing your hands,

01:50.694 --> 01:52.962
do it for the time it takes
to count to a thousand.

01:52.963 --> 01:56.832
One... two... three...
four...

01:56.867 --> 01:58.601
Bobby, when are you and me

01:58.602 --> 02:00.836
gonna go to that nude beach
that Hugo was talking about?

02:00.871 --> 02:03.072
Ugh. Nude beaches are
full of overweight,

02:03.073 --> 02:05.908
out-of-shape old bodies
and I don't want to go there

02:05.909 --> 02:07.376
and realize I look
exactly like that.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.610
I'll go
with you, Mom.

02:08.612 --> 02:10.756
Mother-daughter
nudity day. Fun!

02:10.781 --> 02:12.381
I'm pretty sure
it's no kids allowed.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.716
No kids allowed?

02:13.717 --> 02:15.218
Hmm...

02:16.753 --> 02:18.771
Look through here and
tell me what you see.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.855
It's a cliff.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.757
My turn!

02:21.758 --> 02:22.975
That's a cliff, all right.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.493
Tina, you nailed it!

02:24.494 --> 02:27.480
No, it's a cliff that
overlooks the nude beach.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.749
And if we figure out
how to get up there,

02:29.750 --> 02:32.468
we could sell tours...
nudity tours...

02:32.469 --> 02:34.036
to teenage boys.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.788
It's like the Internet,
but outside.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.073
Yes!

02:39.276 --> 02:40.743
Hey, whoa, God!

02:40.744 --> 02:42.628
We're not even at the
nude beach yet, you.

02:42.629 --> 02:45.081
Guess my boobs didn't get the memo.
Ha!

02:45.082 --> 02:46.792
It's like we're in Paris.

02:46.817 --> 02:48.117
- I love it.
- I know.

02:48.118 --> 02:51.120
C'est la vie.
Let's go! Whoo!

02:54.091 --> 02:56.459
Keep hacking! Come on, guys,

02:56.460 --> 02:58.311
we're gonna be the Lewis
and Clark of nudism!

02:58.312 --> 02:59.979
I'll be the
Sacajawea.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.381
Of sacks!

03:02.416 --> 03:04.050
This is fun!

03:04.084 --> 03:06.018
You already took
your bottoms off!

03:06.019 --> 03:08.321
Whoa, whoa!
What kind of shape is that?

03:08.322 --> 03:10.273
I don't know, it started
out to be a triangle,

03:10.274 --> 03:12.441
but then I had to do it myself,
and then, I don't know...

03:12.442 --> 03:13.859
it's like a flower or something.
Whoa.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.328
Check out the hot guys
in the drum circle.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.322
Hi.

03:17.347 --> 03:21.217
Hey, that looks like...
Oh, my God!

03:21.218 --> 03:23.185
Bobby, you're not
gonna believe this.

03:23.186 --> 03:24.453
He was at
the nude beach!

03:24.454 --> 03:26.188
Wait, who was there?
Hugo!

03:26.189 --> 03:28.224
Yeah, he was trying to
shut the place down.

03:28.225 --> 03:29.892
No, he's one
of them now.

03:29.893 --> 03:32.361
One of what?
A nudist! Nudie!

03:32.362 --> 03:33.729
He was playing
in the waves.

03:33.730 --> 03:34.997
Dancing around.

03:34.998 --> 03:36.132
He looked like, ah...

03:36.133 --> 03:37.233
Madonna in the
"Cherish" video.

03:37.234 --> 03:38.801
Th-that's
not possible.

03:38.802 --> 03:41.170
He said he took a leave
of absence to be nude.

03:41.171 --> 03:44.173
So... Hugo's not our
health inspector anymore?

03:44.174 --> 03:45.474
Do you know
what this means?

03:45.475 --> 03:46.792
We're free!
Ah! Oh, oh!

03:46.793 --> 03:48.127
No more surprise inspections!
Ha, ha!

03:48.128 --> 03:50.379
No more stupid
violations!

03:50.380 --> 03:53.649
And I am not going to
the handwashing class!

03:53.683 --> 03:55.384
Filth!

03:55.385 --> 03:57.386
I wash my hands.

04:01.045 --> 04:02.279
Unbelievable.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.665
Hugo the health
inspector is a nudist!

04:04.666 --> 04:06.416
I know, can
you believe it?

04:06.417 --> 04:09.286
Gretchen and I spotted him
from across the sands...

04:09.287 --> 04:11.088
Out with the bad air,

04:11.089 --> 04:13.357
in with the nude air.

04:13.358 --> 04:14.858
Don't be embarrassed,
Linda.

04:14.859 --> 04:16.442
Yes, we were once an item,

04:16.444 --> 04:18.678
and true, we never saw each
other nude back then...

04:18.680 --> 04:19.913
unfortunately...

04:19.914 --> 04:21.714
but better late than never.

04:21.749 --> 04:24.051
What happened? I thought
you were gonna shut this place down.

04:24.052 --> 04:25.619
Oh, my investigation?

04:25.620 --> 04:27.387
Let's just say
what I uncovered

04:27.388 --> 04:28.705
in that investigation

04:28.706 --> 04:30.908
was my very own soul.
Wow.

04:30.909 --> 04:32.576
The old Hugo would have
seen this man

04:32.577 --> 04:34.044
as a health hazard,
pure and simple.

04:34.045 --> 04:36.013
The new Hugo sees
only a man.

04:36.047 --> 04:37.614
A nude man
selling blondies.

04:37.615 --> 04:39.112
Three blondies,
please.

04:39.117 --> 04:41.051
Whoa, wai... Wha...
Where'd you pull that from?

04:41.052 --> 04:43.053
My fanny pack.
Where's your fanny pack?

04:43.054 --> 04:45.622
Oop. Oh-ho!
There it is.

04:45.623 --> 04:46.890
Well, it kind of
makes sense.

04:46.891 --> 04:48.225
I mean, the guy
was wound so tight

04:48.226 --> 04:50.227
he was like a tubby
little time bomb.

04:50.228 --> 04:51.828
Teletubby time bomb.

04:51.829 --> 04:53.964
Kids! Come in here!
I have amazing news.

04:53.965 --> 04:55.399
Can't it wait?
We're tired.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.234
And rashy.

04:57.268 --> 05:00.003
Where were you?
Bushwacking a trail to the nude overlook.

05:00.004 --> 05:01.838
Dad, before you
say anything,

05:01.839 --> 05:04.174
know that we're gonna come out
of this deal stinkin' rich!

05:04.175 --> 05:06.193
And we're gonna put
a roof over you and Ma.

05:06.227 --> 05:09.029
Well, good luck.
I'd pay not to have to look at those people.

05:09.063 --> 05:10.998
Hey, Dad, whoa,
whoa, whoa, rewind.

05:10.999 --> 05:12.900
I'd like to hear
your amazing news.

05:12.934 --> 05:16.470
Everyone, Hugo is not
a health inspector anymore.

05:16.471 --> 05:19.573
He's a nudist!

05:19.574 --> 05:21.108
Ron! I think I know
why you're here.

05:21.109 --> 05:22.476
Go ahead, I'll pretend
I haven't heard.

05:22.510 --> 05:23.810
It's true.

05:23.811 --> 05:25.479
Hugo has taken
a leave of absence.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.915
We miss him terribly
and hope for his speedy return.

05:27.916 --> 05:29.116
Ha-ha! Right.

05:29.150 --> 05:30.601
All right, well,

05:30.602 --> 05:32.152
I'd like you to meet
Hugo's replacement.

05:32.153 --> 05:34.271
Hey, hello, Tommy Jaronda.
Pleasure to meet you.

05:34.305 --> 05:36.974
Hi. Uh... what,
you're the new Hugo?

05:36.975 --> 05:38.475
Well, there's only one Hugo.

05:38.509 --> 05:40.477
Yeah, well, I'm here,
so let's get into it.

05:40.511 --> 05:42.613
Oh, um...
listen, Inspector, uh, Jaronda,

05:42.614 --> 05:44.047
I know you're just
doing your job,

05:44.048 --> 05:46.283
but we got inspected
two days ago, so...

05:46.284 --> 05:47.550
Yeah, yeah, it's cool, Bob.

05:47.551 --> 05:48.652
Yeah, yeah, you know what?
Call me Tommy.

05:48.686 --> 05:49.920
Okay, Tommy.

05:49.954 --> 05:51.488
All right.

05:51.489 --> 05:53.006
I'm seeing a lot of
tickytacky fouls here.

05:53.007 --> 05:54.508
What, he made you go to
a handwashing seminar?

05:54.509 --> 05:56.426
That's some major B.S.

05:56.461 --> 05:57.861
Pardon my language, kids.
How are you? Hello.

05:57.862 --> 05:59.296
No sweat off
our ass.

05:59.330 --> 06:02.132
Yeah, that Hugo,
he kind of had it out for us.

06:02.166 --> 06:04.334
Ugh. I-I can't stand
inspectors like that.

06:04.335 --> 06:05.836
You know? Makes us
look like turds.

06:05.837 --> 06:07.704
"No one can make you
look like a turd

06:07.705 --> 06:09.706
without your permission."
Eleanor Roosevelt.

06:09.707 --> 06:12.042
Ha! This kid's a trip!
Funny stuff, funny stuff.

06:12.043 --> 06:13.377
You know what?
I'm actually, uh...

06:13.378 --> 06:15.512
I'm starving.
You hungry, Ron-Ton?

06:15.513 --> 06:17.481
You mean eat one of
Bob's burgers?

06:17.482 --> 06:19.549
Hugo would never...
Oh, come on, Ron.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.802
This guy...
How tall is this guy?

06:21.836 --> 06:24.404
He's pretty tall.
The leaning tower of ta... of tall guy.

06:24.405 --> 06:25.872
I'm giving you a
hard time, come here.

06:25.873 --> 06:27.290
Hey, Bob, can you
grill us up a couple?

06:27.325 --> 06:29.226
Um... is this part
of the inspection?

06:29.227 --> 06:32.562
Uh, yeah, something I like to
call the mouth inspection.

06:33.998 --> 06:35.732
Okay.

06:35.733 --> 06:38.135
Whoa! This is incredible!

06:38.169 --> 06:40.037
Wow, first time I
ever got a compliment

06:40.038 --> 06:41.238
from a health
inspector.

06:41.272 --> 06:43.236
You like rock?

06:43.257 --> 06:44.524
Um, yeah.

06:44.525 --> 06:46.226
I like rock... music.

06:46.260 --> 06:47.527
Is that what you're
talking about?

06:47.528 --> 06:48.662
- Yes.
- Okay.

06:48.663 --> 06:50.097
You know, I play
almost every night

06:50.098 --> 06:51.732
over at Pistol McSwish's
Basketball and Brew.

06:51.733 --> 06:53.066
You should come by.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.668
Th-That'd be great.
Absolutely.

06:54.669 --> 06:55.902
What your burger
did to my mouth,

06:55.903 --> 06:57.287
my music is gonna
do to your ears.

06:57.288 --> 06:59.256
That's great...

06:59.290 --> 07:00.791
Come here, come here.
All right, all right.

07:00.792 --> 07:02.025
Get out of here, man.
What are you doing?

07:02.026 --> 07:03.593
Yeah, come here.
Oh. You got me.

07:03.594 --> 07:05.028
What, you punching me?
I'm punching you back.

07:05.063 --> 07:08.031
I think Dad just got to
second base with that guy.

07:09.467 --> 07:12.235
What are you doing
this weekend, brother?

07:12.236 --> 07:14.137
I would like to
visit the nude beach

07:14.138 --> 07:15.605
and see the naked people.

07:15.606 --> 07:17.741
You only live once,
right, my sister?

07:17.775 --> 07:19.076
Haven't you heard?

07:19.077 --> 07:20.944
Kids aren't allowed
on the nude beach.

07:20.945 --> 07:22.646
No!

07:22.647 --> 07:24.648
Unfair, isn't it?

07:24.649 --> 07:26.917
Well, what if I told you that
you could see the nude beach?

07:26.918 --> 07:28.118
Mm!

07:28.152 --> 07:29.419
All the dingles...
Ooh.

07:29.420 --> 07:30.821
All the dongles...
Ahh.

07:30.822 --> 07:33.156
All for one low price.

07:33.157 --> 07:34.224
I want to see the dongles!

07:34.258 --> 07:36.526
Hell, yeah!
Cocoa-buttered boobies!

07:36.561 --> 07:38.595
Sign up here to see the
buff from the bluff!

07:38.596 --> 07:41.098
Don't be shy... they
certainly aren't.

07:41.099 --> 07:42.365
Hello, Louise.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.800
Darryl,
you interested?

07:43.801 --> 07:45.802
You strike me as more
of an indoor nerd.

07:45.803 --> 07:47.270
I am interested,

07:47.271 --> 07:48.722
but not as a customer...

07:48.723 --> 07:50.323
as a key member
of your team.

07:50.324 --> 07:51.591
For a piece
of the action?

07:51.592 --> 07:53.427
Oh-ho-ho,
is that so?

07:53.428 --> 07:54.995
It is so.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.997
If you're nudie watching
from the top of a bluff,

07:56.998 --> 07:59.933
I've got something
that'll double your money.

07:59.967 --> 08:03.403
Basically, this is
the Hubble for boobies.

08:03.438 --> 08:04.938
I've seen my neighbor
across the street

08:04.939 --> 08:07.107
put her bra and girdle on
hundreds of times.

08:07.108 --> 08:08.809
Aren't girdles for old people?

08:08.810 --> 08:10.310
They are.
And she is.

08:10.311 --> 08:11.595
Nice.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.467
How come we're doing
all the lugging?

08:17.468 --> 08:19.469
You're also doing
all the yapping.

08:19.470 --> 08:21.021
Nudes, ho!

08:26.444 --> 08:30.046
Starting tomorrow, we're gonna
be flush with ass-cash.

08:32.015 --> 08:33.549
Whatcha doin', Pops?

08:33.551 --> 08:35.051
Hitting the streets
for some hooch?

08:35.052 --> 08:36.720
No, he's off to
Pistol McSwish's

08:36.721 --> 08:38.621
to see the new health
inspector play his rock.

08:38.623 --> 08:39.856
I have to go.

08:39.857 --> 08:41.457
We want to keep this
guy on our side.

08:41.491 --> 08:43.360
Tommy! I was just heading out
to catch your set...

08:43.394 --> 08:45.962
Bob! You're never
gonna believe it!

08:45.963 --> 08:47.697
That idiot who owns
Pistol McSwish's

08:47.698 --> 08:49.449
told me I can't
play there anymore!

08:49.484 --> 08:51.785
What? How come?
'Cause he don't know nothin'

08:51.786 --> 08:54.154
about good rock, that's how come.
Aw.

08:54.188 --> 08:56.022
Wait... Hey, I
could play here.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.624
Here? Uh, what?
Yeah.

08:57.625 --> 08:59.025
- Nah.
- Yeah, no.

08:59.026 --> 09:01.661
The acoustics
in here are not...

09:01.662 --> 09:03.797
No. The acoustics
in here are great.

09:03.798 --> 09:05.816
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
sounds good in here.

09:05.817 --> 09:07.300
Oh, clapping. Clapping's fun.
Echo. Echo.

09:07.301 --> 09:09.319
Stop. Stop.
Echo. Echo.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.304
Gene, stop. Gene.
Ah! Ah!

09:11.305 --> 09:12.666
Oh, it's done.
I'm grabbing my amp.

09:12.673 --> 09:15.208
Maybe it won't be so bad.

Tommy's music is terrible.

09:50.930 --> 09:52.230
He's driving out
all the customers.

09:52.231 --> 09:54.066
You told him he could
play here all week?

09:54.067 --> 09:55.767
I don't think I did.

09:55.768 --> 09:59.037
I did. But this is still way
better than dealing with Hugo.

09:59.038 --> 10:00.572
You got to say
something.

10:00.573 --> 10:02.941
What about that song,
"Elderly Prostitute"?

10:02.942 --> 10:05.243
♪ Da, da, da, da, da,
elderly prostitute ♪

10:05.244 --> 10:07.295
♪ Da, da, da, boo, ba,
elderly prostitute... ♪

10:07.296 --> 10:08.980
All right,
I'll say something.

10:08.981 --> 10:10.982
So, what'd you guys think?
Did you like my rock?

10:10.983 --> 10:13.418
D'oh.
Tommy, that, uh... rocked.

10:13.419 --> 10:15.754
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Linda, what'd you think?

10:15.755 --> 10:17.756
Ha!
Did it speak to you as a lady?

10:17.757 --> 10:20.258
Now be honest.
It screamed in my face as a lady.

10:20.259 --> 10:22.627
Oh, Mom loved it.
Sell her a CD.

10:22.628 --> 10:24.796
Done.
Yeah, listen, Tommy,

10:24.797 --> 10:27.466
can I talk to you about something I...
Come on, let's go backstage.

10:27.467 --> 10:29.301
Let's go.
What? Oh. Okay.

10:29.302 --> 10:30.736
Hmm!

10:30.737 --> 10:32.504
WhooMan.

10:32.538 --> 10:35.140
What people don't know about
rock, it's a very physical...

10:35.141 --> 10:37.642
experience, you know?
It's-it's very athletic.

10:37.643 --> 10:39.644
You're moving around a lot.
Yeah, yeah.

10:39.645 --> 10:42.114
You noticed that.
It's almost like you moved around too much.

10:42.115 --> 10:44.015
Yeah, I've gotten all kinds
of comments, you know...

10:44.016 --> 10:46.585
"you move around a lot," "you
seem to be having a hard time."

10:46.586 --> 10:48.320
Yeah, I can see that one,
a little bit.

10:48.321 --> 10:50.155
"You're jumping around for no reason."
Right.

10:50.156 --> 10:52.257
"You know, your eyes are bulging
weird. It's off-putting,"

10:52.258 --> 10:54.459
this and that... but that's
what they said about Queen.

10:54.460 --> 10:56.878
Yeah. Did they?
Uh, in rock in general.

10:56.879 --> 10:59.281
Hey, uh, Tommy, uh...
you know, our place

10:59.282 --> 11:01.433
is sort of a family
restaurant and...

11:01.434 --> 11:04.352
some of your songs
are a little risqué.

11:04.353 --> 11:07.339
So I was thinking, maybe don't...
Wait. Hold on a second.

11:07.340 --> 11:10.142
Before I forget, I got a little
something here for you...

11:10.143 --> 11:12.878
it's your inspection file.
There's nothing on here.

11:12.879 --> 11:14.880
That's right! Clean slate.
You're welcome.

11:14.881 --> 11:17.315
Wow. Really?
Yeah, come on, shut up.

11:17.316 --> 11:19.751
Well, thanks, Tommy.
Oh, man.

11:19.786 --> 11:21.486
I still got all that mojo
flowing through me.

11:21.487 --> 11:23.021
You know, I-I got to get it out.

11:23.022 --> 11:24.556
I'm gonna take this van
to the beach

11:24.557 --> 11:26.324
and peel off some burnies.
You want to come?

11:26.359 --> 11:29.311
Um... what's a...
wh-what's a burny?

11:31.147 --> 11:33.398
Ah! Ah, I'm gonna throw up!

11:33.399 --> 11:35.850
I want to go home!
What? This is fun!

11:35.851 --> 11:38.069
Oh, no more burnies!

11:38.070 --> 11:40.388
All right, people, line up!
You'll see we have

11:40.389 --> 11:42.824
many noteworthy specimens
on the beach today.

11:42.825 --> 11:46.027
Only a dollar to get a closer look
at the action. Step right up!

11:46.028 --> 11:48.280
Look through this tube,
see some boob.

11:48.314 --> 11:50.348
Give me the green,
see some peen.

11:53.719 --> 11:55.320
Hey, this is gross.

11:55.321 --> 11:57.823
We came all this way
to see old people?

11:57.824 --> 11:58.823
Ew! Nasty!

11:58.825 --> 11:59.824
You tricked us.

11:59.826 --> 12:01.259
I want my money back.

12:01.260 --> 12:02.494
Uh-oh.

12:02.495 --> 12:04.062
Whoa-whoa, wait,
whoa-ho-ho, you guys,

12:04.063 --> 12:06.498
you're looking at this
the wrong way.

12:06.499 --> 12:07.866
You want to
see nice bodies?!

12:07.867 --> 12:10.718
Get a magazine!
This is real, people!

12:10.719 --> 12:12.404
Check out that guy.
What is that?

12:12.405 --> 12:14.573
Is that a liver spot?
Is that a birthmark?

12:14.574 --> 12:16.891
Is that a third nipple?
Who knows?

12:16.892 --> 12:18.593
You can't write this crap!

12:18.594 --> 12:20.295
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me see.

12:21.731 --> 12:23.698
I get it.

12:23.699 --> 12:26.451
Yeah, I guess, on second look,
it's better.

12:28.221 --> 12:30.288
This, uh... first song goes
pretty deep.

12:30.289 --> 12:31.773
It's called "Daddy."

12:31.774 --> 12:35.243
Uh... at least it's, uh,
uh, a family song.

12:35.278 --> 12:38.046
♪ Daddy! You abandoned me!

12:38.047 --> 12:40.949
♪ Daddy! You sold drugs to me!

12:40.983 --> 12:45.103
♪ Punches are not hugs to me!

12:45.137 --> 12:46.905
Eh. It's no
"Elderly Prostitute."

12:46.939 --> 12:49.140
Bobby, you said
you talked to him.

12:49.141 --> 12:50.609
Uh, I did, kinda.

12:50.610 --> 12:52.344
But then he wiped
our record clean.

12:52.378 --> 12:55.580
♪ Daddy! You're my enemy!

12:55.615 --> 12:58.550
♪ You are my enemy! My enemy!

12:58.584 --> 13:00.819
♪ You are my enemy!
My enemy! ♪

13:00.820 --> 13:02.254
♪ My enemy!

13:02.255 --> 13:03.421
No, don't.

13:03.422 --> 13:04.656
It's just me,
just me, just me.

13:04.657 --> 13:06.258
♪ My enemy!
Oh, sorry.

13:06.292 --> 13:08.126
♪ You, you, you!

13:08.127 --> 13:11.746
♪ The Itsy-Bitsy Stripper
climbed up the brassy pole ♪

13:11.747 --> 13:15.450
♪ Down came her legs
and wrapped around my soul ♪

13:15.451 --> 13:19.254
♪ Weave your web
of your sexy web ♪

13:19.255 --> 13:22.707

13:22.742 --> 13:26.294

13:40.626 --> 13:42.143
Hurdles on a beach?

13:42.144 --> 13:44.379
What are those silly little
skin bags up to now?

13:44.380 --> 13:45.580
Wait a second.

13:45.615 --> 13:47.365
This can't be.

13:47.366 --> 13:48.850
Ow!

13:48.851 --> 13:51.686
Uh, guys, you might
want to buy seats now,

13:51.687 --> 13:53.138
for tomorrow's event.

13:53.172 --> 13:55.123
"Nudecathlon."

13:55.124 --> 13:57.542
That sounds like
decathlon, but nude.

13:57.543 --> 13:58.994
They're naked and old

13:58.995 --> 14:00.829
and they're bringing
home the gold!

14:02.531 --> 14:03.798
Go! You go talk to him!

14:03.799 --> 14:05.634
All right.

14:05.635 --> 14:08.336
Tommy, listen, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

14:08.337 --> 14:10.038
I was thinking,
maybe, um...

14:10.039 --> 14:13.475
you could take some time off
from performing... uh, here.

14:13.509 --> 14:15.477
What? What, what are talking
about, Bobby boy?

14:15.511 --> 14:16.878
It's just that, um...

14:16.879 --> 14:18.380
you know, you could be
performing at...

14:18.381 --> 14:19.848
at way different places.

14:19.882 --> 14:21.383
Huh, it's almost like
you're saying

14:21.384 --> 14:22.817
you don't want me
to play here anymore.

14:22.852 --> 14:24.352
No. Not... No.

14:24.353 --> 14:25.854
You... took that the wrong way.
Uh-huh.

14:25.855 --> 14:27.756
What I meant was... you're great.
Right.

14:27.757 --> 14:29.257
Um, but just not
maybe for, for here.

14:29.258 --> 14:30.659
I'll tell you
what's funny,

14:30.660 --> 14:32.394
you know, that's
what the manager

14:32.395 --> 14:33.762
over at Pistol
McSwish's said, too.

14:33.763 --> 14:35.530
Did he?
Yeah, kind of exactly.

14:35.531 --> 14:37.365
Oh. And it's a shame about
that guy... you know,

14:37.366 --> 14:38.633
he got shut down by me.

14:38.668 --> 14:40.001
What are you doing?

14:40.002 --> 14:41.670
You know, I hate to say this,
but, you know,

14:41.671 --> 14:43.271
you got rat turds
on your floor, man,

14:43.272 --> 14:44.673
and, yeah, I-I gotta write
that up, unfortunately.

14:44.674 --> 14:46.207
What?
Tommy, that's crazy.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.610
You just carry around bags
of rat turds in your pocket?

14:48.611 --> 14:50.578
Yeah, I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:50.613 --> 14:52.547
Yeah, look over... see, I see some more
right over here, see?

14:52.581 --> 14:54.282
You didn't even empty that one!

14:54.283 --> 14:55.684
You're saying
a rat just came in here

14:55.685 --> 14:57.285
and tossed a bag
of its poop on my floor?

14:57.286 --> 14:58.856
Yeah, that's a thing
that happens.

14:58.888 --> 15:01.022
And look, you know,
it can all go away.

15:01.023 --> 15:02.424
Just let me do an encore,

15:02.425 --> 15:03.858
and then come back
and play every night.

15:03.859 --> 15:06.061
No, Tommy! You're not
gonna hold us hostage

15:06.062 --> 15:07.729
with your crappy music
and your threats!

15:07.730 --> 15:08.930
Crappy?!

15:08.931 --> 15:10.699
So get out
of my restaurant, Tommy!

15:10.700 --> 15:12.701
Okay! Of course, you know
what this means:

15:12.702 --> 15:15.603
Until further notice,
you are shut down, my man!

15:15.604 --> 15:18.073
Fine! Why don't you get out,
my man?!

15:18.074 --> 15:21.276
Oh, gladly, my man!

15:21.277 --> 15:23.912
Oh, and guess what?!
You do have bulging eyes!

15:23.913 --> 15:25.547
And it is off-putting!

15:25.548 --> 15:28.016
So, uh... h-how did,
uh, how'd it go?

15:28.050 --> 15:30.418
Great.

15:37.573 --> 15:39.291
We're hungry, Bobby!
Open up!

15:39.325 --> 15:41.393
I can't, Teddy.
Tommy closed us down.

15:41.394 --> 15:43.361
If I serve you,
I could go to jail.

15:43.396 --> 15:45.330
We're willing
to take that chance!

15:45.364 --> 15:46.698
If Tommy doesn't
let us open,

15:46.699 --> 15:48.200
we'll be broke
by next week!

15:48.201 --> 15:49.701
We gotta fix this, Bobby!

15:49.702 --> 15:53.054
There's only one person
who can help us now.

15:53.923 --> 15:55.323
Oh, God.

15:55.324 --> 15:57.025
Oh, don't be so nervous.
It's natural.

15:57.026 --> 15:58.343
What's going on here,
anyway?

15:58.377 --> 16:00.662
- Naked field day! Fun!
- Ugh.

16:00.663 --> 16:01.880
Bubbila, bubbila.

16:01.881 --> 16:03.782
There he is.
I can't believe

16:03.783 --> 16:05.550
I'm gonna grovel
to a naked Hugo.

16:05.551 --> 16:07.402
Bob! Linda!
You're just in time

16:07.403 --> 16:09.104
to see me excel
at nude tetherball!

16:09.105 --> 16:11.189
Hugo, look, I've come
to ask for your help.

16:11.190 --> 16:13.658
The guy who replaced you
shut down the restaurant.

16:13.693 --> 16:15.760
Oh, Bob,
that's a pity.

16:15.761 --> 16:17.696
But the health-inspecting world
doesn't interest me anymore.

16:17.697 --> 16:19.264
Come on.
This guy's nuts, Hugo.

16:19.265 --> 16:21.366
He, he planted rat poop.
You wouldn't even do that.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.068
Listen to you, Bob!

16:23.069 --> 16:24.402
It's all about
things with you!

16:24.403 --> 16:27.506
Restaurants!
Rat feces! Underwear!

16:27.540 --> 16:30.141
Oh, God.
Today is the Nudecathlon,

16:30.142 --> 16:32.811
so either you join me
in nude brotherhood

16:32.812 --> 16:35.347
or kindly return to
your clothed country.

16:35.381 --> 16:36.982
All right, all right.

16:36.983 --> 16:39.284
What, what if I did join you?
The more the merrier.

16:39.285 --> 16:41.052
But what if I competed
and beat you?

16:41.053 --> 16:42.460
Uh, you won't.

16:42.488 --> 16:44.623
But if I did,
would you help us out then?

16:44.624 --> 16:47.225
Is this some kind of bet, Bob?
Yeah. It's a bet.

16:47.226 --> 16:48.760
And what do, what do
I get if I win?

16:48.761 --> 16:50.629
Well, what do you want?
You have to cater

16:50.630 --> 16:53.471
the Nudecathlon closing
ceremony for free.

16:53.499 --> 16:56.751
If this is what it takes,
this is what it takes.

16:56.752 --> 16:58.720
Bob, you do realize what you're getting
yourself into.

16:58.721 --> 17:00.422
A nudecathlon
has 27 events,

17:00.423 --> 17:01.740
not including
warm-up freeze tag.

17:01.741 --> 17:03.058
I quit.

17:03.059 --> 17:05.727
No, Bobby, come on!
You can do it!

17:08.631 --> 17:10.080
Parlays, exactas,
trifectas!

17:10.082 --> 17:12.450
We're taking
all action, people!

17:12.451 --> 17:14.319
Louise, you're gonna want
to see this.

17:19.742 --> 17:21.242
We played with fire,

17:21.243 --> 17:23.511
and this is what we get...
fire in our eyes!

17:23.512 --> 17:25.946
I think Dad looks pretty good,
considering he's had three kids.

17:25.948 --> 17:27.933
Hey, Dad, stop
stretching like that!

17:27.934 --> 17:29.768
Oh, my God!

17:30.937 --> 17:32.270
Zeke here,
calling the action for you

17:32.271 --> 17:33.488
on this sunny afternoon.

17:33.489 --> 17:34.850
There can only be
one winner today,

17:34.857 --> 17:37.242
but many floppy wieners.

17:37.276 --> 17:39.277
And they're off!

17:39.311 --> 17:40.745
Doughboy's out to an early lead!

17:42.148 --> 17:44.299
Go, Bobby, go!

17:44.300 --> 17:48.753

try, and you'll succeed... ♪

18:18.517 --> 18:22.309
Three legs, four thighs
and two ding-dongs.

18:42.591 --> 18:44.392
Fine! Just great!

18:44.393 --> 18:46.728
Well, I must say
you've proven yourself

18:46.729 --> 18:48.096
a worthy naked adversary.

18:48.097 --> 18:50.365
But this last event is
for all the marbles.

18:50.366 --> 18:51.672
Don't say marbles.

18:51.701 --> 18:53.674
Line up for
Greco-Roman wrestling!

18:53.703 --> 18:56.338
Go, Bobby! You're
my big naked knight!

18:56.339 --> 18:57.428
I'm dying.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.857
Gentlemen, enter the ring.

19:04.397 --> 19:05.864
May the best nude win.

19:05.898 --> 19:07.832
May the best
nude win.

19:12.538 --> 19:13.722
Ah, not there.

19:13.723 --> 19:14.889
There you go.

19:14.890 --> 19:16.864
Take this one.
Let go!

19:16.892 --> 19:18.977
Sweep the leg, Dad!
Sweep the leg!

19:18.978 --> 19:21.880
Treat him
like a naked piñata, Dad!

19:21.881 --> 19:23.465
Break him open for some candy!

19:23.466 --> 19:24.949
Okay, Bob,
time to do this!

19:24.950 --> 19:27.917
Not today, Bob!

19:27.920 --> 19:30.622
Oh! The little guy flips
the fay little a patty!

19:30.623 --> 19:32.707
We've got a pin!
No!

19:32.708 --> 19:34.376
Yes! I win!

19:34.377 --> 19:35.910
You took Linda from me,

19:35.911 --> 19:37.912
you were the scourge of
my professional life,

19:37.913 --> 19:40.715
but this time, I win!

19:40.750 --> 19:42.306
You can get off me now, Hugo!

19:42.318 --> 19:43.585
Never!

19:43.586 --> 19:44.753
I win!

19:44.787 --> 19:46.721
Let's go home, Lin.
All right.

19:46.722 --> 19:47.937
I win, win, win!

19:47.957 --> 19:49.924
Wow. That was rough.

19:49.925 --> 19:51.159
Naked and defeated.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.150
Just the way
he entered this world.

19:54.830 --> 19:57.599
Bobby, you put your pants
on backwards, honey.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.768
Doesn't matter.
None of it matters.

19:59.769 --> 20:01.436
We lost the restaurant, Lin.

20:01.437 --> 20:03.438
Tina, let's put our pants on
backwards, too.

20:03.439 --> 20:04.873
Let's do it
for Dad!

20:04.907 --> 20:06.622
I'm wearing a skirt, but okay.

20:09.245 --> 20:10.979
Hugo?
What are you doing here?

20:10.980 --> 20:12.847
And why are you wearing clothes?

20:12.848 --> 20:14.432
Or is that just
body paint?

20:14.466 --> 20:17.508
Today, at the beach, you tasted
my sweet victory,

20:17.520 --> 20:20.438
It wasn't enough.

20:20.473 --> 20:22.040
What does that mean?

20:22.041 --> 20:24.209
I want to shut you down...
I do...

20:24.210 --> 20:27.101
not some dirty
doody-dropper... me.

20:27.113 --> 20:29.047
Until then, you're open
for business.

20:29.048 --> 20:30.381
Ron?

20:30.382 --> 20:31.649
You got it, buddy.

20:31.684 --> 20:33.051
All right!

20:33.052 --> 20:34.358
Well, thanks, Hugo.

20:34.386 --> 20:36.154
All right, everyone!
Load in!

20:38.007 --> 20:40.341

- The closing ceremony, Bob.

20:40.342 --> 20:42.043
Remember?
You have to cater it.

20:42.044 --> 20:43.545
Disrobe at will!

20:43.546 --> 20:45.713
Don't bother with courtesy
tissues on the seats.

20:45.714 --> 20:47.449
Gettin' nude for food!
I love it!

20:47.450 --> 20:49.017
Hold the buns.
Am I right?!

20:49.018 --> 20:51.219
Well, better clean up the gum
under the tables.

20:51.220 --> 20:52.554
I'll get to it.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.355
Tina, no.
I hate you, Hugo.

20:55.624 --> 20:57.842
