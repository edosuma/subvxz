00:18.190 --> 00:20.200
Hey, are you ok?

00:21.270 --> 00:22.520
Hotchner, is he ok?

00:22.540 --> 00:24.060
He can't fly for a little bit.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.470
His ears are-- but
he's gonna be fine.

00:29.450 --> 00:33.340
{\a6}<i>LOWER CANAAN,OHIO</i>

01:18.100 --> 01:21.230
Jeez, bo, you scared me half to death.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.810
Such a cliche.

01:38.690 --> 01:42.810
See that, bo? Guess i'm supposed
to make a wish or something, right?

01:55.460 --> 01:57.430
Come on, bo.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.990
How is the buzzing now?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.190
It's ok. I think i could
actually get used to that part.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.790
The problem is dealing with the pain.

02:51.810 --> 02:53.780
You're experiencing hyperacusis.

02:53.810 --> 02:57.530
It's caused by sudden loud
noises, like an explosion.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.100
So what do we do about it, doctor?

02:59.110 --> 03:00.780
You have a small tear
in your right eardrum.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.320
We'll treat that with a bonding agent.

03:02.340 --> 03:04.290
It'll most likely heal
itself in a week or two.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.190
Most likely?

03:05.200 --> 03:08.440
The condition can
sometimes become permanent.

03:09.660 --> 03:11.170
But i can go back to work?

03:11.190 --> 03:15.550
Putting someone in the field with acute
sensitivity to sound would be a mistake.

03:15.560 --> 03:19.440
Agent hotchner, if you're not careful,
you could lose your hearing entirely.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.380
- i understand.
- good.

03:22.890 --> 03:26.090
But you'll... Sign my return to duty?

03:28.050 --> 03:30.340
W-what if i said i'd...

03:30.350 --> 03:31.960
Take it easy and...

03:31.970 --> 03:34.820
Limit my role in the field?

03:35.390 --> 03:38.460
Stay out of loud places.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.170
Your phone is ringing.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.540
What's up, j.j.?

03:52.570 --> 03:53.650
This is delilah grennan.

03:53.660 --> 03:57.270
She was bludgeoned and raped during the
night at her home in lower canaan, ohio.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.390
Lower where?

03:58.400 --> 04:00.970
Small town 40 miles
outside of cincinnati.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.310
Staging the body face-up with the
arms across the chest like that.

04:04.340 --> 04:05.480
Ritual.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.250
Nice hair, by the way.

04:08.170 --> 04:10.300
- thanks.
- uh, there's more.

04:10.310 --> 04:12.270
Small puncture wounds on her stomach.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.530
Note the lack of blood.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.120
They were inflicted post-mortem.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.950
Were there any other victims?

04:16.970 --> 04:19.060
Kind of.

04:19.640 --> 04:23.610
Victimology and signature match a serial
killer from the same town 10 years ago--

04:23.640 --> 04:26.790
6 victims spanning over 10
months.he called himself--

04:26.800 --> 04:28.550
The angel maker. I remember the case.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.590
- they caught that guy.
- and executed him.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.930
That's right. He was put to death by
lethal injection a year ago yesterday.

04:33.940 --> 04:34.720
Yesterday.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.050
So we're looking for a copycat.

04:36.060 --> 04:38.480
Honoring the anniversary
of his hero's death.

04:38.490 --> 04:41.010
It says here they found
semen at the crime scene.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.610
Perhaps locals will get a dna match
when they run it through vicap?

04:43.630 --> 04:44.890
Well, that's where it gets weird.

04:44.910 --> 04:48.330
They ran it already and
they got a match, too.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.880
Well, if they already have
a name, why'd they call us?

04:50.890 --> 04:53.260
They've got to be kidding.

04:53.270 --> 04:59.970
The match they got back on the dna is to
a cortland bryce ryan, otherwise known as...

05:00.260 --> 05:02.810
The angel maker.

"we all die.

05:39.090 --> 05:41.210
"the goal isn't to live forever.

05:41.230 --> 05:44.030
The goal is to create
something that will."

05:44.040 --> 05:45.770
*****

05:47.210 --> 05:50.190
The angel maker's victims were beaten
with the assailant's bare hands.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.910
Delilah grennan was bludgeoned with
a heavy instrument, maybe a hammer.

05:53.930 --> 05:57.850
Ok, so this unsub's a weaker guy, but at
least someone who perceives himself that way.

05:57.870 --> 06:00.830
So he brought along the hammer to make
certain his victim wouldn't fight back?

06:00.850 --> 06:02.530
They have parachutes on-board, right?

06:02.540 --> 06:04.920
They should. It's standard
on all federal air transport.

06:04.930 --> 06:09.060
Maybe we can give one to the elephant
in the room, get him out of here?

06:09.080 --> 06:11.540
That'd be the elephant
with the dead man's dna.

06:11.550 --> 06:14.260
Well, obviously somebody
planted the semen on the victim.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.610
In the victim.

06:15.620 --> 06:16.870
That's one theory.

06:16.890 --> 06:17.750
There's another?

06:17.780 --> 06:21.380
Think about who shares the exact
dna makeup of another person.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.500
Reid, you're not seriously floating
around the idea of an evil twin, are you?

06:24.530 --> 06:27.370
No, i'm not. I'm floating
the idea of an eviler twin.

06:27.380 --> 06:31.250
Traditionally, the concept is
a good twin and an evil twin.

06:31.260 --> 06:35.440
But in this case, it's
evil twin, eviler twin.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.410
- hotch?
- yeah.

06:47.420 --> 06:50.010
You have been cleared
to fly, haven't you?

06:54.420 --> 06:58.050
Before cortland ryan, this town hadn't
seen a homicide in over 30 years.

06:58.070 --> 06:59.880
He didn't just kill those 6 women.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.610
He killed a way of life.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.840
Now this thing's got people
thinking he's come back.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.210
They don't really think that, do they?

07:05.230 --> 07:09.840
I guess when you've been scared by something, i
mean really scared, that fear's in you forever.

07:09.870 --> 07:12.230
Let's stick to the facts. Were
there signs of forced entry?

07:12.240 --> 07:17.940
None that we could find, but whoever killed delilah
grennan opened up every window in this house before he left.

07:17.950 --> 07:20.090
That's a signature from
the previous murders.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.090
A detail we never
released to the public.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.360
And it came out at the trial?

07:23.370 --> 07:24.230
No, sir.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.360
Prosecution had ryan nailed 9
ways to sunday. Didn't need it.

07:27.900 --> 07:31.270
So i'm hard-pressed to know how this
copycat knew about those windows.

07:31.290 --> 07:35.730
The man we're looking for is most likely a
fan who exhaustively studied the first killings

07:35.740 --> 07:38.220
And used them to form
his own murder fantasies.

07:38.230 --> 07:40.600
He knows this case as
well as us; better, maybe,

07:40.610 --> 07:43.310
If he had actual contact with
ryan while he was incarcerated.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.940
We sent one of our agents to
hawkesville prison to look into it.

07:45.950 --> 07:47.480
And the semen?

07:47.490 --> 07:51.760
Smuggled out of the prison, kept on ice,
brought out on the anniversary of the execution.

07:51.790 --> 07:55.290
There's an entire cottage industry based
on serial killer effects and memorabilia.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.470
You can find absolutely anything
if you know the right people.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.910
Question is, is this a one-time
commemoration or is it just the beginning?

08:03.990 --> 08:05.460
What about the puncture wounds?

08:05.300 --> 08:08.950
{\a6}<i>City Morgue LOWER CANAAN,OHIO</i>

08:05.480 --> 08:09.720
My best guess is a small
screwdriver, like a phillips head.

08:10.110 --> 08:11.730
Just like the prior murders.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.980
This guy's a stickler for the details.

08:13.990 --> 08:18.030
The groupings in the prior victims were
always different in number and arrangement.

08:18.860 --> 08:21.610
3 wounds on this one.

08:21.620 --> 08:25.050
5, 24. He was all over the map.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.180
But i also found traces
of paper in the wounds.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.970
Paper? Like tissue?

08:28.980 --> 08:30.420
Like notebook paper.

08:30.430 --> 08:31.600
Well, that's new.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.960
Unique to the copycat.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.490
What is it?

08:42.820 --> 08:46.920
I don't know. It just seems familiar.

08:50.550 --> 08:53.150
Ryan didn't have any next of
kin, so after the execution,

08:53.160 --> 08:56.220
All of his effects got boxed and stored.

08:56.590 --> 08:58.130
This is all his correspondence?

08:58.150 --> 08:59.290
Copies, at least.

08:59.300 --> 09:03.240
Helps the warden keep tabs on certain
prisoners if he can know what's in their mail.

09:03.250 --> 09:04.230
There's a lot of letters.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.420
A lot of fans.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.810
Real lady killer.

09:09.730 --> 09:10.810
What about male fans?

09:10.830 --> 09:12.350
Some, yeah. Freaks.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.940
This one kid would come
by. Musician, i think.

09:14.950 --> 09:16.830
Black clothes and eyeliner and all that.

09:16.840 --> 09:21.340
He sent ryan his demo tape and some
sheet music he wrote in his own blood.

09:22.230 --> 09:25.650
Did you ever catch ryan trying to smuggle
anything out, to this kid or anyone else?

09:25.680 --> 09:29.710
Usual problem we have is stuff
being smuggled in, not out.

09:31.050 --> 09:34.100
His dna was found at a fresh
crime scene in lower canaan.

09:34.110 --> 09:35.820
What kind of dna we talking about?

09:35.840 --> 09:39.200
Type of dna that cats in lockup
don't have occasion to use.

09:40.220 --> 09:43.260
All right. Well, listen, thank you for all this, but
i want to look at all your visitor logs, all right?

09:44.250 --> 09:45.960
Excuse me.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.490
Yeah, j.j. ?

09:49.720 --> 09:51.320
Ok, uh...

09:51.330 --> 09:53.740
Yeah, i'm headed right back.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.020
Something wrong?

09:56.040 --> 09:59.850
A local newspaper just got a letter from
someone claiming to be the angel maker.

10:01.760 --> 10:06.110
"i give you a legacy, a breath of
life from the angel maker himself.

10:06.120 --> 10:11.640
Those who prayed to forget me will one
day see my face and shrink in fear."

10:11.650 --> 10:14.840
That's the last thing
people need right now.

10:14.850 --> 10:17.010
Reid, how's it compare with
the original correspondence?

10:17.040 --> 10:18.980
They share some
compelling characteristics.

10:18.990 --> 10:22.580
I'd obviously like to look at it under
magnification with a better light.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.900
Best guess, reid?

10:24.910 --> 10:27.260
Say it's authentic.

10:32.150 --> 10:35.800
How can this letter be authentic
if the guy's been dead for a year?

10:35.820 --> 10:37.140
Could be an elaborate forgery.

10:37.150 --> 10:39.800
Or it could be the genuine article,
just written before his death.

10:39.820 --> 10:41.160
Well, mail here isn't that slow.

10:41.170 --> 10:42.820
Or released through an intermediary.

10:42.830 --> 10:44.300
You mean the copycat?

10:44.310 --> 10:47.690
We're going over the prison visitor logs
to check who had multiple visits with ryan,

10:47.720 --> 10:50.430
Try to narrow our suspect pool.

10:51.090 --> 10:53.240
Sela? What are you doing here?

10:53.250 --> 10:55.670
Is it true? There's a letter?

10:56.110 --> 10:56.960
How did you know?

10:56.970 --> 10:59.260
You didn't really think you
could keep that quiet around here.

10:59.270 --> 11:02.650
The letter's not from him, not
the way people might be saying.

11:02.660 --> 11:04.630
- what does that mean?
- it...

11:05.450 --> 11:07.850
It means we think he has
someone on the outside, a friend.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.130
What if you're
wrong?What if--

11:10.140 --> 11:12.260
There's no such thing as ghosts, sela.

11:12.270 --> 11:13.710
I'm not talking about a ghost.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.990
I am talking about those
rumors about the execution,

11:17.010 --> 11:19.210
How there were problems,
how it didn't work right.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.770
What are you suggesting?

11:20.780 --> 11:23.540
What if he's still out there?

11:24.440 --> 11:26.740
Don't do that.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.660
You think i'm the only one?

11:28.670 --> 11:30.660
Look outside.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.450
They want proof that he's dead.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.990
I have to advise against this.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.060
All due respect, this isn't your town.

11:44.090 --> 11:47.080
I have to convince them that
cortland ryan is dead and buried.

11:47.100 --> 11:50.470
But you're indulging this killer by
perpetuating the ruse he's created.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.350
He's right.

11:51.360 --> 11:54.210
It may embolden him,
prompt more murders.

11:54.230 --> 11:57.320
Sela lost her only
daughter to that bastard.

11:57.330 --> 12:00.220
We met when i was working
the case, grew close.

12:00.230 --> 12:05.130
I thought we'd gotten past all this,
but i guess i was kidding myself.

12:17.180 --> 12:18.890
Hotch?

12:20.300 --> 12:22.120
Hotch?

12:26.000 --> 12:29.070
Hotch, are you all
right? Can i do anything?

12:35.520 --> 12:38.560
Yeah, i'm ok, i'm ok, i'm ok. Ok.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.950
My god.

13:14.380 --> 13:16.490
Cortland ryan is dead.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.930
There's no two ways about it.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.580
We're just trying to
be thorough, dr. Hagen.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.120
We heard that there may have been
irregularities with the execution.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.740
His heart was stopped.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.380
His pupils were nonresponsive.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.110
Trust me.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.770
This is not the first
execution i've pronounced at.

13:31.790 --> 13:33.940
But it was the last.

13:33.970 --> 13:39.460
Did something happen that day to prompt your
resignation from the corrections department?

13:42.880 --> 13:45.400
Everyone dies different.

13:45.410 --> 13:46.750
Ryan went hard is all.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.630
What does that mean, doctor?

13:50.270 --> 13:54.610
After we cycled the drugs, we
realized he was still alive.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.650
We weren't prepared for that.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.290
How is that possible?

14:00.300 --> 14:03.260
The catheter dislodged.

14:03.270 --> 14:07.480
We reinserted it, started
the potassium chloride.

14:09.070 --> 14:12.010
He started shaking.

14:12.950 --> 14:13.870
Spitting.

14:13.890 --> 14:16.160
He was suffocating.

14:16.870 --> 14:19.630
Catheter failed again.

14:19.640 --> 14:25.980
Took him almost an hour to die, almost
as if something were keeping him here.

14:28.490 --> 14:30.850
He said this was going
to happen, you know.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.200
That what was gonna happen?

14:32.210 --> 14:33.640
His last words.

14:33.650 --> 14:36.180
He said he'd come back.

14:40.630 --> 14:45.810
You may think you've seen the last of
me, but death cannot take me from you.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.400
I will be born again.

14:49.410 --> 14:52.600
Today you make me a legend.

14:52.610 --> 14:55.300
Always had a flair for the dramatic.

14:55.310 --> 14:59.800
Set the stage perfectly: a latter-day
lazarus returning to deliver hell on earth.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.200
We need to debunk this, or
the whole town's gonna panic.

15:02.230 --> 15:03.290
Little late for that.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.360
The grave-robbing we can explain.

15:05.370 --> 15:06.410
It has to be a fan.

15:06.420 --> 15:09.670
You think the same person that did
the copycat murder took ryan's body?

15:09.700 --> 15:11.260
It's possible. He had to have help.

15:11.270 --> 15:12.640
Someone on the inside.

15:12.650 --> 15:16.270
I suppose you're gonna tell me there's
a cottage industry for that, too.

15:17.390 --> 15:19.960
Did you know that john
wayne gacy painted clowns?

15:19.980 --> 15:23.980
A murdering pedophile paints clowns,
and people hang them on their walls.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.960
It's creepy on so many
levels.i mean, clowns--

15:25.970 --> 15:27.690
Garcia, i didn't know
you had that hang-up.

15:27.700 --> 15:30.580
Coulrophobia--
abnormal fear of clowns.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.240
Oh, no, there is nothing
abnormal about it.

15:32.260 --> 15:34.980
When i was 12, a hobo clown groped
my breast at a birthday party

15:34.990 --> 15:38.390
And made this old-timey
honking noise when he did it.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.060
Apparently making it funny makes it ok.

15:41.070 --> 15:44.640
Were you able to find any auctions
on angel maker memorabilia?

15:44.660 --> 15:46.770
Oh, my vision. I found a ton.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.720
Mr. Maker was quite the self-promoter.

15:48.740 --> 15:54.300
He autographed everything: photos, panties,
and for the discerning collector, screwdrivers.

15:54.330 --> 15:55.400
You got to be kidding me.

15:55.410 --> 15:58.880
Yeah. He also made these little origami
figurines out of cigarette boxes,

15:58.890 --> 16:00.870
Which, i hate to say, are really cute.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.660
Did you pinpoint the
most active collectors?

16:02.670 --> 16:04.410
That would be his overseas fans.

16:04.430 --> 16:07.230
What about local buyers who also
turned up on the prison visitor log?

16:07.240 --> 16:07.780
Zilch.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.490
What about sellers? High-volume broker
might know a broader spectrum of fans.

16:11.500 --> 16:15.030
There is one guy in particular who seems
to be the local distributor, as it were.

16:15.040 --> 16:15.770
You got a name?

16:15.780 --> 16:17.550
Shebang!

16:17.560 --> 16:19.410
- sid rutledge.
- rutledge?

16:19.420 --> 16:20.120
You know him?

16:20.130 --> 16:22.250
He's a guard at hawkesville.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.810
Sid rutledge, fbi. Open up.

16:34.830 --> 16:35.860
Just want to talk.

16:35.890 --> 16:37.900
I can't see anyone.

16:40.640 --> 16:44.040
Oh, guy's got two dead
bolts. He doesn't use either?

16:47.610 --> 16:49.700
Sid?

16:49.990 --> 16:52.460
Sid, we're coming in.

17:11.839 --> 17:14.369
Wakey, wakey, my man.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.950
Damn.

17:19.609 --> 17:22.380
One to the grill, one to
the groin. That's personal.

17:22.390 --> 17:27.550
Yeah, well, if rutledge was selling the
unsub memorabilia, he knew his identity.

17:27.569 --> 17:30.530
Now the unsub's covering his tracks.

17:30.540 --> 17:34.570
Rutledge probably contacted him
after you paid a visit to the prison.

17:35.030 --> 17:38.790
He let him in, let his guard down, boom.

17:39.460 --> 17:43.390
A little, uh, heavy on the old spice.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.310
Strikes me as an aqua velva guy.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.020
Man, you're good.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.900
Hey, it looks like he took something.

17:53.810 --> 17:56.230
Hello.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.970
I think we've got this unsub all wrong.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.050
There have been some strange
happenings in this case,

18:03.060 --> 18:06.820
But i urge you not to abandon
reason in the search of the truth.

18:06.830 --> 18:10.770
This is not the work of a ghost, and it's not
the work of a killer come back from the dead.

18:10.790 --> 18:15.400
This is the work of somebody who lives right
here in lower canaan, and this person is a woman.

18:16.540 --> 18:20.650
Her last victim, sid rutledge--
he was the angel maker's mule.

18:20.680 --> 18:25.120
He smuggled items out of hawkesville prison, including
the semen that was planted at the first crime scene.

18:25.150 --> 18:29.780
She killed rutledge because he knew she was the
copycat, and also because he was blackmailing her.

18:29.790 --> 18:32.090
So i'm thinking you and i need to talk.

18:32.130 --> 18:35.460
We now know that rutledge was transferred
to hawkesville from a female prison,

18:35.480 --> 18:39.820
In the wake of allegations that he was using his
position to leverage sexual favors from inmates.

18:39.840 --> 18:44.250
And we think he did the same thing to our unsub;
in exchange for his silence, he wanted sex.

18:44.270 --> 18:45.790
Because she shot him in the junk, right?

18:45.820 --> 18:50.070
That, and the fact that he took a pde-5
inhibitor shortly before his murder.

18:50.090 --> 18:51.220
A what?

18:51.230 --> 18:51.910
Viagra.

18:51.930 --> 18:55.780
We're looking for a white woman in her
mid-30s and she's highly intelligent.

18:55.810 --> 18:58.260
And she's not just a
fan, she's a groupie.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.100
Now, she's not what you
would normally expect.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.750
More often than not, they're
attractive, they're well-educated,

19:02.760 --> 19:05.320
They're successful;
some are even married.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.980
Generally, they fall into
types. Some are reformers.

19:07.990 --> 19:10.350
They're on a mission to save
or rescue these murderers.

19:10.370 --> 19:13.630
Often, this type of groupie has been raised
in a repressive, religious environment

19:13.640 --> 19:19.200
And specifically have been exposed to the ideals
of sexual repression and subjugation of women.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.600
Our unsub is a different type, one
who suffers from hybristophilia.

19:22.610 --> 19:25.150
It's a sexual attraction to
men who commit violent crimes.

19:25.160 --> 19:30.980
They give her a power that she lacks, which stems
from low self-esteem and a need for a father figure.

19:30.990 --> 19:32.550
Well, the victims were raped.

19:32.570 --> 19:33.990
How do you explain that?

19:34.010 --> 19:37.610
She's using an instrument to
simulate the sexual assault...

19:39.450 --> 19:41.930
This is something that
she keeps in her rape kit,

19:41.940 --> 19:44.850
Along with the weapon that she's
using to bludgeon her victims.

19:44.860 --> 19:49.230
This is a list of women who visited and
wrote the angel maker while he was in prison.

19:49.260 --> 19:53.700
We've started to track these leads, but the
list is extensive, so we're gonna need your help.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.030
Hey, you ever get groupies
at your book signing?

19:58.060 --> 20:01.240
Sometimes, if barry
manilow isn't in town.

20:01.250 --> 20:02.600
Any of them look like that?

20:02.610 --> 20:03.840
Shara carlino.

20:03.850 --> 20:06.270
She visited ryan over 70 times.

20:06.290 --> 20:11.160
Waits an average of 3 hours for a
10-minute visit, mandatory strip search.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.800
Would you endure that for a guy?

20:12.820 --> 20:14.710
For barry manilow, maybe.

20:14.720 --> 20:18.530
She was a marketing vp in
cincy till '99, moved here,

20:18.540 --> 20:22.610
Took an outside sales job,
commission only-- serious pay cut.

20:22.630 --> 20:25.200
I'm guessing she came for the view.

20:31.160 --> 20:34.700
According to these logs, you were
the angel maker's number-one fan.

20:34.740 --> 20:37.660
His name is cortland,
and i wasn't a fan.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.600
How would you characterize
your relationship?

20:39.620 --> 20:40.540
We were lovers.

20:40.570 --> 20:43.760
Last time i checked, they didn't
allow conjugal visits on death row.

20:43.770 --> 20:46.750
It wasn't about physical interaction.

20:46.760 --> 20:50.810
When you take away the
flesh, there's only the soul.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.760
Everything was understood.

20:53.790 --> 20:55.360
There were no secrets.

20:55.370 --> 21:00.730
Cortland made me feel alive,
in a way no free man ever could.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.850
Where were you on the
16th of this month?

21:03.860 --> 21:04.490
Why?

21:04.500 --> 21:10.740
We believe this copycat killing was committed by
a female fan, someone who knew cortland very well.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.020
I was out of town with the company.

21:14.030 --> 21:15.670
Ask anyone here.

21:15.680 --> 21:19.040
- do you know another woman--
- there were no others.

21:19.050 --> 21:24.480
I--i can show you logs, photocopies of fan
letters, women who sent cortland pictures,

21:24.490 --> 21:27.700
- their underwear-- - they
didn't mean anything to him.

21:30.280 --> 21:34.460
But whatever connection you had with
cortland was severed when he died.

21:34.490 --> 21:36.720
Not the copycat's.

21:36.730 --> 21:40.590
Every time she kills,
it reinforces their love.

21:40.610 --> 21:44.700
That is, of course, unless
you help us stop her.

21:49.870 --> 21:55.240
He sent me a letter a few
months before he--he was...

21:56.870 --> 22:01.460
I knew it wasn't meant for me,
because it was addressed to...

22:01.490 --> 22:03.340
"my dove."

22:03.350 --> 22:05.180
He never called me that.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.020
- do you still have it?
- no.

22:07.410 --> 22:08.750
I burned it.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.900
Did the text reveal
anything about the woman?

22:10.920 --> 22:12.270
The text was a joke.

22:12.290 --> 22:16.940
Usually his prose was
seamless and beautiful, but...

22:17.300 --> 22:18.910
This was...

22:18.940 --> 22:20.720
Pedestrian and crude.

22:20.750 --> 22:24.130
You never asked him who this dove was?

22:24.450 --> 22:27.090
I thought there were
no secrets between you.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.970
You've never been in love, have you?

23:14.040 --> 23:15.740
Victim's maxine chandler.

23:15.770 --> 23:19.990
Neighbors say she's lived here her
whole life, all 28 years of it, anyway.

23:20.020 --> 23:21.270
How many kids does she have?

23:21.280 --> 23:23.180
Well, none of her own.

23:23.190 --> 23:25.470
Runs a day care.

23:25.480 --> 23:30.340
The guy that called 911 came here to drop
off his toddler, found maxine in her bedroom.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.350
Coroner's in there with her now.

23:32.370 --> 23:33.470
You check all entry points?

23:33.490 --> 23:35.950
Yeah. No damage, no tool
marks. Same as the first.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.220
Now that we have two victims,
we have data we can compare.

23:38.230 --> 23:40.050
We should see what
victimology can tell us.

23:40.060 --> 23:42.500
I'll get j. To bring us the
files on the first victim.

23:44.070 --> 23:45.130
What'd you find?

23:45.140 --> 23:47.180
Well, i put the time
of death around 2 a.m.

23:47.190 --> 23:49.650
Victim was struck multiple
times with a blunt object.

23:49.660 --> 23:51.990
Signs of penetration, fluids.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.450
Same post-mortem mutilation?

23:54.460 --> 23:57.180
Same, but, uh, different.

23:57.690 --> 23:59.760
9 puncture marks this time.

23:59.780 --> 24:03.850
I wish i could say this was about the unsub's
disorganized behavior or mounting rage.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.250
It doesn't feel that way.

24:05.260 --> 24:07.090
No, they definitely mean something.

24:07.100 --> 24:09.480
- can i have your pen?
- yeah. What is it?

24:09.490 --> 24:11.720
I'm not sure.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.870
- she did this.
- what do you mean?

24:20.880 --> 24:21.900
The unsub.

24:21.910 --> 24:25.890
She made these dots like this
before she made the puncture wounds.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.960
That's why the coroner
found paper in the wounds.

24:27.970 --> 24:29.280
It was a template.

24:29.290 --> 24:32.840
The angel maker did it from memory,
but she needed a guide to get it right.

24:32.850 --> 24:35.760
We need to go back and re-examine
each of the patterns. Where's reid?

24:35.770 --> 24:39.690
Here's another one to
dove-- november 2, 2006.

24:39.710 --> 24:41.040
- same thing?
- yeah.

24:41.050 --> 24:44.050
"weather is good here.
Out in the garden all day.

24:44.060 --> 24:45.710
Birds land on the fence.

24:45.730 --> 24:47.710
The moon is full now."

24:47.720 --> 24:50.810
He got an hour a day in a concrete yard.

24:50.830 --> 24:53.730
There was no garden.
There were no birds.

24:54.170 --> 24:55.490
Death row haiku.

24:55.500 --> 24:59.000
I mean, you have to
try to write this bad.

24:59.010 --> 25:00.350
I think he did.

25:00.360 --> 25:05.390
He tried very hard to put each word,
each letter, even, in the right order.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.830
So it's a code.

25:06.850 --> 25:09.690
This steganographic method would allow him
to write letters that don't appear enciphered.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.930
The real message would
be hiding in plain sight.

25:11.950 --> 25:13.070
What do you need to crack it?

25:13.080 --> 25:16.520
The ability to clone myself
and a year's supply of adderall.

25:16.530 --> 25:19.270
I'll put on the coffee.

25:20.610 --> 25:22.860
Small towns suck for victimology.

25:22.870 --> 25:24.780
Too much overlap.

25:24.800 --> 25:28.310
I've got both women at the same
church, same doctor, same grocery store.

25:28.350 --> 25:30.190
She's mimicking the angel maker.

25:30.210 --> 25:31.780
Maybe we should look at his victims.

25:31.790 --> 25:33.120
Yeah, but there's a disconnect.

25:33.130 --> 25:36.240
The angel maker chose women
because they excited him sexually.

25:36.250 --> 25:38.640
The copycat's satisfaction isn't sexual.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.530
Now it's in perfectly
re-creating the murders.

25:40.550 --> 25:43.550
So what she looks for in a victim
is someone who's easy to kill.

25:43.570 --> 25:46.970
Which, for her, means
easy access to their homes.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.860
What did delilah grennan do for work?

25:49.870 --> 25:52.120
She made jewelry, sold
it out of her home.

25:52.140 --> 25:54.370
So they both had home-based businesses.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.990
A stranger could walk in off the
street and be a prospective customer.

25:57.010 --> 26:00.670
Unsub poses as a client,
maybe uses the bathroom,

26:00.680 --> 26:02.790
Cracks the window, so
she can get back in later.

26:02.820 --> 26:07.580
Let's check their business records and
see who came by on the day of the murders.

26:13.470 --> 26:16.160
No matching names.

26:22.660 --> 26:25.160
Sky's so clear here, huh?

26:25.420 --> 26:28.160
Never see stars like this in d.c.

26:28.900 --> 26:31.140
It's beautiful.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.270
Oh, my god.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.450
The puncture wounds on the victim's
stomachs represent constellations.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.330
Constellations?

26:40.340 --> 26:42.710
Don't tell me this guy
was following the zodiac.

26:42.760 --> 26:47.060
No, these are from a family of
constellations known as the heavenly waters.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.710
Well, i guess we know how
he came up with the nickname.

26:48.730 --> 26:54.140
That's why he'd open up all the windows after each
kill, so their souls could be released into the sky.

26:54.160 --> 26:57.980
Delphinus, the dolphin;
equuleus, the little horse.

26:57.990 --> 26:59.990
- anything sound familiar?
- his origami things.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.840
There are 9 constellations
in the heavenly waters.

27:02.850 --> 27:04.310
The angel maker killed 6.

27:04.320 --> 27:07.180
Yeah, our unsub continued
where he left off.

27:07.190 --> 27:12.040
First she did vela, and then
last night she did carina.

27:12.060 --> 27:15.570
The only one left is columba, the dove.

27:15.580 --> 27:18.450
One more kill and she completes his set.

27:18.480 --> 27:21.780
She knew the meaning of the stomach
wounds, something even we didn't know.

27:21.790 --> 27:24.830
She must have been a lot
closer to ryan than we thought.

27:24.840 --> 27:27.390
They weren't just close.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.530
They were in love.

27:31.330 --> 27:32.620
How'd you crack it?

27:32.650 --> 27:33.710
I profiled the author.

27:33.720 --> 27:37.780
Cortland ryan was on death row with several
high-ranking members of the aryan brotherhood.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.300
He got the code from the aryans?

27:39.320 --> 27:42.010
Either that or he read a lot
of 16th-century literature.

27:42.030 --> 27:46.530
The aryans liked to use a cipher based on a
400-year-old code written by sir francis bacon.

27:46.550 --> 27:47.640
So it's a binary code.

27:47.670 --> 27:51.060
Yeah. Bacon used a 21-letter
alphabet. This one's 24.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.780
Each letter is assigned a
bit string of 5 binary digits.

27:53.810 --> 27:56.010
This combination yields
32 possible encodings.

27:56.020 --> 27:58.340
Normally you'd use a computer
to run all these combinations,

27:58.350 --> 28:02.050
But it was quicker just to do it
longhand until i found the right one.

28:04.590 --> 28:06.880
He's so lifelike.

28:07.400 --> 28:11.260
Now we don't have a complete record of their
correspondence, but i was able to make a chronology.

28:11.280 --> 28:15.090
The woman he calls "dove" established
contact shortly after the trial.

28:15.100 --> 28:18.320
"my dearest cortland, thank
you for writing back to me.

28:18.340 --> 28:21.250
The day the verdict was read,
we shared a silent moment..."

28:21.270 --> 28:24.930
"i knew then there was a
force willing us together.

28:24.950 --> 28:28.960
"every time i see you, i
feel warmed as if by the sun,

28:28.970 --> 28:33.230
And yet i fear if i come too close,"
i'll be consumed by your fire."

28:33.250 --> 28:36.350
"ever since your visit, i am
crazed with thoughts of you.

28:36.370 --> 28:38.310
"already you've entered my dreams.

28:38.330 --> 28:43.600
Each time you appear to me, i'm embraced
by a feeling of trust and belief,"

28:43.620 --> 28:45.290
As if i've known you all my life."

28:45.300 --> 28:50.620
"as always, i am touched by your
words, "but i long to see you again.

28:50.630 --> 28:53.530
Days pass quietly, one into the next...

28:53.550 --> 28:54.270
"my dove..."

28:54.290 --> 28:55.450
"i can think of little else..."

28:55.460 --> 28:56.890
My secret wife...

28:56.900 --> 28:58.240
If only they would let us marry...

28:58.250 --> 28:59.340
All appeals are lost...

28:59.380 --> 29:00.550
I could finally hold your hand...

29:00.560 --> 29:03.470
The guards celebrated my defeat
by clearing out my cell...

29:03.480 --> 29:05.000
Here is my face...

29:05.010 --> 29:07.500
Possessions matter little
to a condemned man...

29:07.520 --> 29:12.840
"they die with you,the only
man who will ever truly see me."

29:12.860 --> 29:16.760
But i can't leave this world before
seeing your face one last time.

29:16.780 --> 29:19.880
"i will bring a part of
you back into the world,

29:19.890 --> 29:23.770
And forever you will watch
over us from the stars."

29:24.600 --> 29:29.190
What do you think she meant by that last
line: i will bring a part of you back?

29:29.210 --> 29:30.560
The murders?

29:30.570 --> 29:31.720
She brought him back to life.

29:31.730 --> 29:34.460
What if she was talking about his child?

29:34.480 --> 29:37.750
Well, she did say "us"--
watch over us from the stars.

29:37.780 --> 29:40.910
She used the semen samples to
plant evidence, not to get pregnant.

29:40.930 --> 29:42.660
What if she did both?

29:42.670 --> 29:46.280
Well, if she actually had his kid, we might
be able to track her through birth records.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.250
Agent hotchner?

29:48.280 --> 29:51.570
We just got a report of a woman attacked
in her house by a female assailant.

29:51.590 --> 29:52.310
Is she ok?

29:52.320 --> 29:55.760
Sounds like it, but i can't say
the same for the attacker, though.

29:55.770 --> 29:59.270
Neighbors heard cries for help,
pretty soon half the block was on her.

30:01.250 --> 30:05.670
The victim was coming home from work, said
the suspect approached her in her driveway.

30:05.700 --> 30:07.850
Asked to use the phone
to call a tow truck.

30:07.860 --> 30:09.050
She let her in the house?

30:09.060 --> 30:10.380
That's when the suspect jumped her.

30:10.390 --> 30:11.640
That's not our unsub's m.o.

30:11.650 --> 30:15.020
Maybe she was rushing it, trying
to finish off the last victim.

30:18.060 --> 30:19.540
That's shara.

30:19.560 --> 30:20.220
You know her?

30:20.230 --> 30:23.310
Shara carlino. Rossi and
i already interviewed her.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.360
She's cortland's number-one fan.

30:25.370 --> 30:28.760
Her alibi is solid. She's not our unsub.

30:35.540 --> 30:37.220
Shara...

30:37.230 --> 30:38.910
Why?

30:38.930 --> 30:40.920
It worked for her.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.430
Why not for me?

30:43.860 --> 30:46.740
I just want us to be together again.

30:53.750 --> 30:58.610
Ok, there were 463 children born in the
lower canaan area between 2006 and 2008,

30:58.620 --> 31:01.860
So if you want me to find baby angel
maker, we're gonna have to narrow this down.

31:01.890 --> 31:06.450
All right, well, reid still has more
letters to decode, but he did find a phrase:

31:06.460 --> 31:09.830
I knew even before they told me
that the future had taken root.

31:09.850 --> 31:10.850
Taken root?

31:10.870 --> 31:12.250
Sounds like someone got good news.

31:12.260 --> 31:13.390
Date of conception.

31:13.410 --> 31:14.620
And the date of that letter?

31:14.640 --> 31:17.440
Uh, january 7, 2007.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.390
Ok, so we fast-forward 9 months.

31:19.430 --> 31:22.510
- uh, 10 months, actually.
- really?

31:22.520 --> 31:24.560
I know. It was news to me, too.

31:25.370 --> 31:26.230
Ok.

31:26.250 --> 31:30.580
So we'll search birth records from
august to september 2007. How's that?

31:30.590 --> 31:35.190
We'll do single mothers only, in case
she wanted to keep the father a secret,

31:35.210 --> 31:38.120
You know, didn't want to brag: "oh,
your baby daddy's a third-grade teacher?

31:38.150 --> 31:41.470
Well, mine likes to poke people in
the stomach with tools, so there."

31:41.480 --> 31:45.070
There. 9 names. Now that's
a little more manageable.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.850
Hannah dreyfus was in an auto
accident. She could barely walk.

31:49.350 --> 31:52.780
Shannon conway moved away when
the plant closed a year ago.

31:52.790 --> 31:54.060
Any other names you recognize?

31:54.070 --> 31:56.960
- no. - i don't--whoa.
What is it?

31:56.970 --> 32:00.650
Well, this one here sounds familiar,
but i can't really place it.

32:00.670 --> 32:02.290
Chloe kelcher.

32:02.310 --> 32:04.460
Chloe kelcher. That is familiar.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.280
Chloe kelcher.

32:16.310 --> 32:17.650
She was on the jury.

32:17.660 --> 32:18.960
Well, that makes sense.

32:18.980 --> 32:22.610
She would have been exposed to the case evidence,
seen firsthand what he did to his victims.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.760
That's when she fell in love with him,
sitting across the courtroom every day.

32:25.790 --> 32:29.510
Well, it's one thing to have a relationship
with a killer, it's another to become one.

32:29.530 --> 32:32.460
There might have been an incident
that prompted the transformation.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.800
I think i know what it was.

32:37.050 --> 32:39.170
It's a death certificate.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.060
Microvesicular steatosis.

32:41.070 --> 32:43.800
Her baby died at the hospital.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.450
- clear!
- clear.

32:56.830 --> 32:57.700
She's not here.

32:57.730 --> 32:59.340
All right. We all know
what the end game is.

32:59.350 --> 33:00.680
She's looking for her final victim.

33:00.700 --> 33:01.870
She may have already chosen one.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.790
Let's tear this place apart, look for
anything that might tell us who she's targeted.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.770
Look at this.

33:17.220 --> 33:20.170
She did everything she
could to deny the truth.

33:20.180 --> 33:21.860
What, that he was a killer?

33:21.890 --> 33:24.940
That they'd never be together.

33:27.620 --> 33:29.650
Note the view.

33:29.660 --> 33:31.970
Daddy's watching.

33:35.330 --> 33:37.730
It must have devastated her to
think that she could hold on to ryan

33:37.740 --> 33:40.090
By having his child
and then lose the baby.

33:40.110 --> 33:43.240
Completing his murders became the
only way she could hold on to him.

33:55.670 --> 33:58.900
Not the only way. Well...

34:00.970 --> 34:03.260
Guess that answers that.

34:03.270 --> 34:06.290
I assume that's who i think it is.

34:06.650 --> 34:08.380
Got an appointment book here.

34:08.389 --> 34:12.920
Meetings with delilah grennan and
maxine chandler the day of each murder.

34:12.940 --> 34:14.530
Sheriff, have you found
her tools or the gun?

34:14.550 --> 34:15.850
Nothing yet.

34:15.870 --> 34:19.679
She has something this morning:
faye landreaux, 162 north--

34:19.699 --> 34:21.179
North red river drive.

34:21.190 --> 34:23.010
She's a cpa. She does my taxes.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.219
- she work out of her house?
- yep.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.020
Let's go.

34:27.780 --> 34:29.840
That's it. '85 volkswagen.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.090
Chloe's here.

34:32.550 --> 34:33.630
Car's still warm.

34:33.650 --> 34:36.020
We got to be right behind her.

34:37.290 --> 34:39.360
Her windows are closed.
That's a good sign.

34:39.370 --> 34:40.870
Well, my team's ready.
Let's get in there.

34:40.880 --> 34:43.020
Sheriff, we didn't recover
a gun at chloe's house.

34:43.030 --> 34:44.400
We have to assume she's armed.

34:44.420 --> 34:45.159
Well, so are we.

34:45.170 --> 34:49.940
If you storm in now, she'll shoot, and
chances are she'll start with your accountant.

34:49.949 --> 34:51.560
What do you think, guys?

34:51.570 --> 34:53.420
I think you should
look for an open window.

34:53.440 --> 34:55.550
Sheriff, i need you to bring all
your vehicles around to the front,

34:55.570 --> 34:58.190
Facing forward with lights
off, and i need a megaphone.

35:29.950 --> 35:31.720
Hotch, i don't think you
can get through to her.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.280
No, but maybe you can.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.970
Profile's clear. You
can't talk this woman down.

35:34.980 --> 35:36.440
No, but just to occupy her.

35:36.460 --> 35:37.570
If we're right about the m.o.

35:37.590 --> 35:39.230
She's left a window open somewhere.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.220
Morgan will find a way in. We
just need to buy him some time.

35:56.860 --> 35:58.170
Hit the lights.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.340
Chloe, this is the fbi.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.240
We know you're in there, and we
know what you're trying to do.

36:03.250 --> 36:05.360
What are you doing? What are you doing?

36:05.370 --> 36:09.090
Don't move, bitch, or i swear
to god, i will split you in two.

36:09.110 --> 36:10.310
Please, don't do this.

36:10.330 --> 36:13.060
Roll over. Roll over. Roll over!

36:13.070 --> 36:16.870
I know you think that finishing what
cortland started will bring you closer to him,

36:16.880 --> 36:19.860
But first you should
know who he really was.

36:20.670 --> 36:21.820
Don't worry.

36:21.850 --> 36:24.280
There's a much better place for you.

36:24.630 --> 36:28.040
I know you thought you were
special, but the truth is,

36:28.050 --> 36:30.840
The same things he wrote to you,
he wrote to many other women.

36:30.850 --> 36:33.420
I've seen the letters.

36:33.430 --> 36:39.020
Dozens read the same lines: without
the flesh, there is only the soul.

36:39.050 --> 36:42.330
You don't need to touch me to
feel the love i have for you.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.020
Does that sound familiar?

36:50.300 --> 36:53.170
Cortland wasn't who you thought he was.

36:53.180 --> 36:55.900
He--he was a
narcissist, chloe.

36:55.930 --> 36:58.980
He wasn't capable of
loving anyone but himself.

36:59.000 --> 37:05.180
To carla kettinger, he wrote, ever since your
visit, i am crazed with thoughts of you...

37:05.210 --> 37:08.130
"already you have entered my dreams."

37:08.150 --> 37:09.800
"each time you appear to me..."

37:09.830 --> 37:13.450
"i am embraced by a feeling
of trust "and belief,

37:13.460 --> 37:16.540
As if i've known you all my life.

37:17.630 --> 37:20.270
It's clear to me now
that you are my fate.

37:20.290 --> 37:22.990
" we are destined to be together."

37:23.010 --> 37:26.530
"and when i am gone,
that will not change.

37:27.490 --> 37:32.580
"i will live on in you. In
death, our union will be eternal."

37:33.980 --> 37:36.240
"all appeals are lost.

37:36.250 --> 37:38.540
The guards celebrated my
defeat by clearing out..."

37:38.550 --> 37:43.500
No, no, no. Don't speak. Don't talk.
I'm gonna get you out of here, ok?

37:43.510 --> 37:46.020
"possessions matter
little to a condemned man,

37:46.030 --> 37:50.500
"but i cannot leave this world without
seeing your face one last time."

37:50.510 --> 37:53.860
Ok, that window over there. I want you
to go to that window. It's gonna be ok.

37:54.190 --> 37:54.770
Ok, go, go, go.

37:54.790 --> 37:57.750
It isn't your fault that he
made you feel these things.

37:57.770 --> 38:01.110
It isn't your fault your baby died.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.180
No!

38:20.490 --> 38:22.060
It's over, chloe.

38:22.070 --> 38:24.210
We have faye.

38:29.310 --> 38:32.470
You have nowhere to go.

38:44.310 --> 38:46.350
I think we got some tear gas.
I'm assuming it's still good.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.310
We're not gonna need it. She
doesn't have any place to go.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.080
Well, maybe she'll do us all
a favor and put herself down.

38:51.100 --> 38:54.530
She's not gonna do that,
either. She's not done.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.220
Chloe, drop the gun.

39:04.630 --> 39:07.740
Chloe, drop the gun.

39:10.150 --> 39:12.690
Damn it, lady, drop it!

39:19.570 --> 39:22.070
I'm coming to you, baby.

39:31.940 --> 39:33.820
Hotch.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.330
What did she do?

40:01.600 --> 40:03.500
We took her victim.

40:03.510 --> 40:05.400
She had to complete his work.

40:05.420 --> 40:09.200
Wendell berry said, "the
past is our definition.

40:09.210 --> 40:14.310
"we may strive with good reason to
escape it or to escape what is bad in it,"

40:14.330 --> 40:17.940
But we will escape it only by
adding something better to it."

40:17.960 --> 40:19.110
I made these for your flight.

40:19.130 --> 40:19.900
Thank you.

40:19.930 --> 40:22.790
- it's small thanks,
but-- - my recipe.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.680
I'm sorry you had to go
through all this again.

40:25.710 --> 40:28.890
I suppose we never stop
going through it, but...

40:28.900 --> 40:30.530
Maybe now.

40:30.540 --> 40:32.600
Hopefully.

40:35.470 --> 40:37.630
She gonna be ok?

40:38.090 --> 40:40.560
Yeah, she'll be fine.

40:40.570 --> 40:44.340
Maybe you got to sit with the past
before you can walk away from it.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.560
Thank you, sheriff.

40:47.060 --> 40:48.440
Thank you.

40:48.450 --> 40:50.310
Anyone get directions
back to the airstrip?

40:50.320 --> 40:52.060
Town's only got one road. We'll find it.

40:52.070 --> 40:54.690
Yeah, morgan doesn't
like to follow directions.

40:54.700 --> 40:55.690
You didn't know about that?

40:55.700 --> 40:57.420
Yeah, he likes to vibe it.

40:57.430 --> 40:59.390
Ok, smart ass. You drive.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.700
Oh, great.

41:02.190 --> 41:04.530
- thank you.
- for the flight.

41:04.540 --> 41:05.720
What?

41:05.730 --> 41:07.680
Just gonna grab my bag.

41:09.940 --> 41:10.760
You're not coming?

41:10.770 --> 41:13.010
I, uh, think i'm gonna drive.

41:13.020 --> 41:15.010
Oh, it's over 7 hours back to quantico.

41:15.020 --> 41:17.590
I really shouldn't be flying.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.140
I've done that drive before.

41:21.150 --> 41:23.540
You'll see a lot of pretty
country along the byways.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.540
You might consider...

41:25.570 --> 41:28.320
Stretching it out a day or two.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.900
Maybe i will. Thanks.
