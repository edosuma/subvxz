- I'm gonna run up

- Hi, hon.

08:32.734 --> 08:35.033

Hi, daddy.

08:35.033 --> 08:36.567
What are you doing?

08:36.600 --> 08:38.400
- Hey, Brittany, have you seen
my running shoes at all?

08:38.433 --> 08:41.367
- Jax, just look
in the closet or something.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
I don't know.
They're not up here.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.033

08:44.033 --> 08:45.567
- Okay, so Ariana and Tom
are bringing the car.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.433
- Yeah, they'll be here soon.
I think we got, like, a SUV.

08:47.433 --> 08:50.567
- Raquel and James
are following behind?

08:50.600 --> 08:51.667
- James and Raquel,
they can't fit

08:51.700 --> 08:52.700
in our car anyway, so...

08:54.700 --> 08:56.400
- Jax has been really,
really worried

08:56.433 --> 08:59.467
about staying with James
in a small cabin.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.066
- Please let me put
my fist in your face.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.600
- Don't cross me
in front of Lisa.

09:02.633 --> 09:04.333
You wanna go?

09:04.367 --> 09:05.600

my ----ing fist

09:06.633 --> 09:08.000
in your ----ing face.

09:08.033 --> 09:08.700
- They've, like,
gotten a lot better,

09:08.734 --> 09:11.033
but being there
for a whole weekend,

09:11.066 --> 09:12.567
it's, like, a big step.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.467
- And it's only three bedrooms.
- Mm-hmm.

09:15.767 --> 09:17.600
This James thing,
I'm--I'm worried.

09:17.633 --> 09:21.400
Every time he has
one drink too many,

09:21.433 --> 09:23.467
I feel like there's
just a switch

09:23.500 --> 09:25.166
that's flipped with James.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.000
He starts coming after me
and my man.

09:29.033 --> 09:30.333
- Do you think James still,

09:30.367 --> 09:31.734
like, has feelings
for you or something?

09:31.767 --> 09:34.033
Because I just don't get why,
every time he's drunk,

09:34.066 --> 09:36.433
he has to attack,
like, your relationship.

09:36.467 --> 09:38.467
- I've heard that
from multiple people.

09:38.467 --> 09:42.100
Like, "I think that he still
feels this way about you."

09:42.133 --> 09:45.467
I mean, Logan has said it.
Everybody has said that.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.100
James and I will never

09:47.133 --> 09:49.700
be romantically involved
ever again.

09:49.734 --> 09:52.567
That ship sailed
a long time ago,

09:52.600 --> 09:55.033
and since then, it's done sank.

09:55.066 --> 09:56.500
Hell no.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.100
I look at him like a brother,

09:58.100 --> 09:59.767
so I don't ever think
what he's thinking,

09:59.767 --> 10:02.166
because me, I'm just like,
"Oh, you're a ----ing weirdo."

10:02.200 --> 10:03.734
- You're so in the friend zone,
but he might not be.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.433

17:07.734 --> 17:10.033
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna be honest with you.

17:10.066 --> 17:12.166
James has said some things
about my man,

17:12.166 --> 17:15.433
who normally,
if anybody else said that,

17:15.433 --> 17:18.233
we would have
a lot of problems.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.066
Okay.

17:23.100 --> 17:25.066
He goes in on the person

17:25.100 --> 17:27.567
who I would literally
take a bullet for.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.333
And he thinks it's okay.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.166
- I'm not even
repeating it again.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.433
- Like, I couldn't believe
he actually went that far.

17:36.467 --> 17:38.467
- Honey, honey,
you ----ed the fat man

17:38.500 --> 17:41.066
'cause he pays for your rent.
- Hey, hey, stop.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.066
- So you gotta keep him
in check, is what I'm saying.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.467
- I'm not gonna stand up
for that at all.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.734
- But I'm about ready
to ----ing snap.

17:46.767 --> 17:50.400

Yeah.

there's a million--

21:01.200 --> 21:02.367
- Here's the lesson:

21:02.367 --> 21:04.467
don't talk when you're apart,

21:04.500 --> 21:06.367
and when you get back together,
don't talk about

21:06.400 --> 21:09.633

when you were apart.

21:09.633 --> 21:13.367

is so

You're so--

21:17.667 --> 21:20.467

I'm in love with him,

21:20.500 --> 21:24.700

are happening.

21:24.734 --> 21:27.333

Tom's trying

27:22.500 --> 27:24.000

- No, I know--all right, sorry.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.100

- No, no, no, no, no.

27:28.533 --> 27:31.467

27:31.500 --> 27:34.400
Jax could technically

28:10.700 --> 28:13.767

28:14.000 --> 28:15.100

28:15.133 --> 28:16.100
- So here's how
this game works.

28:16.133 --> 28:17.633
You draw a card...

28:17.667 --> 28:19.567
and based on whoever
you're with,

28:19.567 --> 28:22.033
the question is asked
to that couple.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.233
- The partners that we are now.
- Yes.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.233

we're playing this.

- Yes.
- All right,

28:26.033 --> 28:27.533
it's just safer that way.
- You do girls first,

28:27.567 --> 28:28.734
then you do guys.
- If you don't want to say...

28:28.734 --> 28:30.133
both: Then you have to drink.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.567
- All right, so Ariana,
you're up.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.000
- Oh.
- To Rob.

28:33.033 --> 28:35.066
- Have you ever been
to a swingers party?

28:35.100 --> 28:37.166
If not, are you interested?

28:37.200 --> 28:39.200
- I'm never opposed
to experiencing something

28:39.200 --> 28:40.333
in my life,
but I don't think

28:40.333 --> 28:42.533
I would wanna get involved,

28:42.567 --> 28:43.700
'cause I like my dick,

28:43.734 --> 28:45.000
and I wanna keep it
attached to me.

28:45.033 --> 28:46.266
- I like his dick too.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.667
- And I don't want my dick
to fall off.

28:47.700 --> 28:49.567
- Yeah, I don't want it
to fall off either.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.066
It's really good.
- Like, here's the thing:

28:51.066 --> 28:52.333
if everybody...

28:52.333 --> 28:53.734
Yeah, Scheana
is a little bit more

28:53.734 --> 28:56.200
all in your face
about their relationship,

28:56.200 --> 28:59.200
but Rob's with her,
so if he's with her,

28:59.200 --> 29:00.667
he must like that about her.

29:00.700 --> 29:03.533
- Now, James, now you ask
a question to--

29:03.567 --> 29:05.000
I think it's Arianna
is the one we're at.

29:05.033 --> 29:07.333
- Yeah.
- Have you ever experienced

29:07.333 --> 29:09.300
a multiple orgasm?

29:09.333 --> 29:11.333
- Yes.

29:11.367 --> 29:13.033
Good for you.

29:13.066 --> 29:15.200
- Standing ovation for Ariana.

29:15.233 --> 29:16.600
- More like standing ovation
for Tom.

29:16.633 --> 29:18.166
- Yes, girl.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.033
- Ariana and I are doing
a lot better.

29:20.066 --> 29:21.567
We are having sex.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.166
I don't have
a college degree, man.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.500
I have barely
an associate's degree.

34:42.533 --> 34:44.500
And I'm going up on my 40s,
okay?

34:44.533 --> 34:46.767
So there's not much time
for me to, like--

34:47.000 --> 34:49.233
- Stop, Jax.
We're not gonna bartend at Sur,

34:49.266 --> 34:50.767
like, forever
and ever and ever.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.233
- Ugh...it's looking like that
for me right now.

34:53.233 --> 34:54.467
Dude, you're doing it.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.467
- You're thinking
about your future.

34:55.500 --> 34:56.767
- Jax! Come in!

34:57.000 --> 34:58.467
- We should probably
go check on them.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.066
- I think we should just play,
like, truth or dare

35:00.100 --> 35:01.500
or something.
- I've always enjoyed

35:01.533 --> 35:04.333
truth or dare, as long as I--
I always say "dare."

35:04.367 --> 35:06.400
- Burritos.
- Yummy, yummy, yummy.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.367
- Truth or dare.

35:10.367 --> 35:13.734
I dare Ariana
to lick Lala's nipples.

35:13.767 --> 35:16.500
up out
of my face, boy.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.200
I like to have
a couple of drinks.

35:18.233 --> 35:19.333
And we're gonna try
and get this party

35:19.367 --> 35:20.567
a little bit started.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.066
If Lala wants to be
a wet blanket

35:22.100 --> 35:23.133
and be boring all night,
go ahead.

35:23.133 --> 35:24.633
All right, I dare--

35:24.667 --> 35:26.266
- I think we should probably
come up with rules.

35:26.266 --> 35:27.533
- What are you talking about,
Lala?

35:27.533 --> 35:30.367
Shut up.
- It's annoying that when any--

35:30.400 --> 35:32.533
Dude, if you tell me
to shut up one more time,

35:32.567 --> 35:34.400
I'm gonna ----ing pop you.
- Pump the breaks, boo,

35:34.400 --> 35:36.100
pump the breaks.
- I'm telling you.

35:36.133 --> 35:37.600
The problem I'm having
is the fact that,

35:37.633 --> 35:40.000
because I've been friends
with you for--

35:41.400 --> 35:43.066
Are you good, or...
What are you doing?

35:44.567 --> 35:46.133
else

35:46.166 --> 35:47.400
am I talking to?
- Oh, my God, I swear

35:47.433 --> 35:48.533
I thought you were talking
to Ariana.

35:48.567 --> 35:49.533
- Oh, my God.
- Save your talk

35:49.567 --> 35:51.600
for someone who cares.

35:54.033 --> 35:56.467
- I'm telling you, Raquel.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.133
I'm about to draw blood
from this boy.

35:59.166 --> 36:00.266
- I don't know
why he does that.

36:00.266 --> 36:01.467
- What a little ----ing bitch.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.200
- Hey, change your--
change your attitude

36:03.233 --> 36:04.500
with someone else--
- Change your attitude.

36:04.533 --> 36:06.300
- All right,
so what do I have to do?

36:06.333 --> 36:07.567
You wanna hug it out?
off.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.166
What is your problem?
- Okay, hug it--

36:09.166 --> 36:10.433
- Stop coming for me.
I'm over it.

36:10.467 --> 36:12.433
- You're okay.
- No, I'm not okay.

36:12.467 --> 36:14.133
You telling me to shut up--
- Shh, you're gonna be okay.

36:14.166 --> 36:15.567
- And you telling me--
no, I'm not--

36:15.567 --> 36:17.533
- No, you're gonna be okay.
- Listen, James.

36:17.567 --> 36:19.300
- I know you're not right now.
- James.

36:19.300 --> 36:22.033
- Do I have a reason why
he keeps

36:22.066 --> 36:23.233
- James, listen
to what she's saying.

36:23.266 --> 36:24.433
- No, you don't have
a reason why.

36:24.433 --> 36:26.033
- He keeps ----ing
poking at me, dude.

36:26.066 --> 36:27.533
- You do, though, James.
I know you know it.

36:27.567 --> 36:29.233
- No, yeah, no, tell me--
- He does keep going up to her

36:29.266 --> 36:30.233
and, like, poking her.
- Tell me. Tell me.

36:30.266 --> 36:31.667
What's the problem?

36:34.066 --> 36:35.400
Come on.

36:35.433 --> 36:37.433
- I'm telling you right now.
Kennedy, look at me.

36:37.467 --> 36:38.633
What do you want from me?

36:38.667 --> 36:40.433
- What do you think
I want from you?

36:40.433 --> 36:42.100
- Do I have to apologize--
- I think you guys...

36:43.300 --> 36:45.233
- I say you're
a little judgmental

36:45.266 --> 36:46.567
'cause you do judge people
more than others sometimes.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.667
- I cannot follow.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.433
I can't follow.
- All right, girls.

36:50.467 --> 36:52.066
I'm done talking to all of you.
- Kennedy.

36:52.100 --> 36:53.433
- Bye.
- Honey, I think

36:53.467 --> 36:54.600
you're so hilarious.
I think you're great.

36:54.633 --> 36:56.266
I just saw you
being mean to her.

36:56.300 --> 36:57.333
That's the only reason
I stepped up.

36:57.367 --> 36:58.600
- I know, I know.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.066
And everyone's seen
your boyfriend

37:00.100 --> 37:01.200
do other stuff too--
- Hey.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.467
- Hey!
This is not about anybody

37:02.467 --> 37:04.600
but you right now.
Knock it the  off!

37:04.633 --> 37:06.066
- We're leaving.
- You guys need to have

37:06.100 --> 37:07.600
a moment.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.533
- My patience with James,

37:09.567 --> 37:11.200
it's about to run out.

37:11.233 --> 37:13.533
I'm tripping about one thing
and one thing only.

37:13.567 --> 37:15.200
Hello?
Look at me.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.200
What the  is wrong
with you?

37:17.200 --> 37:18.600
We go from zero,

37:18.633 --> 37:21.400
and then we're at 100
real ----ing quick.

37:21.433 --> 37:22.667

with some ----ing respect

37:22.700 --> 37:24.333
if you want
some goddamn respect!

37:24.333 --> 37:26.033
- I would love it.
I've been trying

37:26.066 --> 37:27.433
to get respect from you--
- Bye, Lala.

37:27.467 --> 37:28.533
Idiot.
- Stop calling me an idiot.

37:28.567 --> 37:29.633
You're coming for me, honey.

37:29.633 --> 37:31.467
- Bye.
Ignoring you.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.734
- What makes me upset
is the way you speak to people.

thinking she's better
than other people.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.633
You can't blame her

38:19.667 --> 38:21.367
because with her boyfriend
comes the high life,

38:21.400 --> 38:23.133

you would not be having it.

you come for me?

That's how I came for you?

39:39.767 --> 39:41.567

- And you say it again!

39:43.066 --> 39:44.567
What is your--
up!

39:44.600 --> 39:46.300
- What is your--
- You talk about my man

39:46.333 --> 39:47.600
one more goddamn time...
- Get over it.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.333
- I'm gonna ----ing
draw blood from your face.

39:49.333 --> 39:50.700

down, bitch.

39:50.734 --> 39:52.700
- You sit down.
down.

39:52.734 --> 39:55.333
- I have super high anxiety
when I'm around James.

39:55.333 --> 39:57.333
Like, I--I can't do this, man.

39:57.367 --> 39:59.033
Like, I'm very fragile,
like, right now.

39:59.066 --> 40:00.700
I'm in a fragile state.

40:00.734 --> 40:02.734
- I've told you things that
I have never told anybody.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.433
- I know that,
and I will never ----ing--

40:04.467 --> 40:06.333
- And sometimes
you use that against me.

40:06.367 --> 40:08.300
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Please stop doing that.

40:08.333 --> 40:10.300
- I don't want it to be
"not really that much."

40:10.333 --> 40:11.600
I don't want it to be at all.
- There are things--

40:11.633 --> 40:13.333
as a friend, there's things
I've told you.

40:13.333 --> 40:14.600
You've always put
them around.

40:14.633 --> 40:16.500
- You guys, literally,
Rob is about to

40:16.500 --> 40:17.767
go to sleep
in the ----ing garage.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.066
- Dude, this is why
I didn't wanna come here.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.367
- You came for my man.
- I didn't come for your man.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.633
- I understand you're 23,
but this is unfair, dude.

40:24.667 --> 40:26.700
- You came for my man--

40:26.734 --> 40:28.367
How's that?
- You know good

40:28.400 --> 40:29.433
and goddamn well
the way you came for my man.

40:29.467 --> 40:30.700
So stop coming for him.

40:30.734 --> 40:32.633
Kennedy, you--
- I met him three times.

40:32.667 --> 40:34.066
I'm not coming for her.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.467
I'm not trying
to sink her ship.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.233
But do I see them
as a perfect fit? No.

40:38.233 --> 40:40.467
Me and you were best friends
on and off.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.367
Dating, not dating, this...
- Get over it.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.633
Just relax.
It'll be fine.

40:45.633 --> 40:47.233
Please.
- Okay, sometimes,

40:47.266 --> 40:48.600
I am frustrated about things,

40:48.633 --> 40:50.367
and I want to sit here
and I want to talk about it.

40:50.367 --> 40:51.767
- I just want to go to sleep.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.300
- It's part of being
in a relationship.

40:53.333 --> 40:54.500
It's part of having a partner.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.333
You've gotta deal
with sh-- like that.

40:56.367 --> 40:57.500
- I'm going to sleep.

40:57.533 --> 40:58.734
- If you don't agree,
just tell me.

40:58.767 --> 41:00.500
- I'm tired.
I'm not gonna

41:00.533 --> 41:02.400
listen to this
bullsh-- anymore.

41:02.433 --> 41:05.467
- He knows that you and I were
intimate at one point, okay?

41:05.500 --> 41:08.500
- Nice way of saying, yeah,
we ----ed, but, yeah.

41:08.533 --> 41:09.734
- I need you
to stop coming for me.

41:09.767 --> 41:11.734
- I'm sorry.
- Stop coming for my man.

41:11.767 --> 41:13.533
But, James...
- I have a negativ negative

41:13.533 --> 41:15.400
view on that man,

41:15.400 --> 41:18.533
because he put the one
I love in jeopardy.

41:18.567 --> 41:20.667
So then when you've now
become to a place

41:20.667 --> 41:22.400
where you--and now
you're finally happy,

41:22.400 --> 41:23.667
and now you're talking
about a future together,

41:23.667 --> 41:27.133
and a house--beautiful
things that I want--

41:27.133 --> 41:29.100
I've loved you,

41:29.133 --> 41:31.100
so you have
to understand, Lala.

41:31.133 --> 41:34.133
I'm not used to it yet.

41:34.133 --> 41:35.767
- You've seen me and Raquel--
- Our friendship

41:36.000 --> 41:38.467
is going to change.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.567
- Do you realize
how much respect we owe

41:44.600 --> 41:46.667
to Raquel and my dude?

41:46.700 --> 41:50.500
James thinks
that he's losing me

41:50.533 --> 41:52.567
to my relationship.

41:52.567 --> 41:55.033
But it's okay for him
to have a girlfriend.

41:55.033 --> 41:56.700
It's okay for me
to have a boyfriend.

41:56.734 --> 41:59.700
It doesn't mean that we're
losing each other as friends.

41:59.700 --> 42:03.567
I don't think he knows
