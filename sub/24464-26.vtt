00:18.340 --> 00:21.020
Hey Skips, could you help us fix the pump in the fountain?

00:21.100 --> 00:23.020
I'm kinda busy here.

00:23.020 --> 00:26.180
But Skips, we don't know what we're 'doin!

00:27.300 --> 00:29.360
Alright, I'll be right there.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.420
Skips, can you help me put a new can of paint on the benches?

00:37.060 --> 00:38.440
Yeah, sure.

00:40.420 --> 00:43.940
Skips, can you help me plant my chrysanthemums?

00:47.020 --> 00:48.060
Skips?

00:48.060 --> 00:50.060
Sure, sure, Pops.

00:50.060 --> 00:52.740
Skips, what's going on with those benches?

00:52.780 --> 00:56.040
- I had to help- - Skips, we ruptured another gas line.

00:56.580 --> 00:58.020
Skips! Skips! Skips!

00:58.020 --> 00:59.440
What? What? What?

00:59.440 --> 01:01.140
Lunch. Lunch. Lunch.

01:01.380 --> 01:03.620
Why don't you guys go on ahead without me?

01:03.640 --> 01:05.620
I've got too much to do today.

01:05.620 --> 01:08.060
Come on dude. You look like you could use some lunch.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.500
Ok, ok. How much money would it take

01:13.500 --> 01:18.040
for you to walk up to a shark and punch it in the face? Go!

01:18.840 --> 01:22.020
I'd do it for half a million. But only if I get to pick the shark.

01:22.020 --> 01:26.360
I'd do it for $500 and get me a pair of genuine leather biker boots!

01:26.420 --> 01:27.360
What about you, Skips?

01:27.380 --> 01:28.960
Look, I don't know, guys.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.400
Can we just get back to the park? I got a lot to do today!

01:32.400 --> 01:33.520
Oh, oh! I got one.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.160
You should get a motorcycle before you get biker boots.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.520
Yeah, I'm gonna listen to the guy who doesn't drive a hog to work every day.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.760
Hey! Everybody stop leaving and come look at this!

01:45.660 --> 01:49.800
A stress test machine. I always ace these things.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.360
You know who else always aces these things?

01:53.360 --> 01:54.700
MY MOM!

01:56.200 --> 01:58.100
Stress Level: Moderate.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.120
Suggestion: Cut back on the late night pies.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.400
Aw, what?

02:04.160 --> 02:05.220
You should do it, Skips.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.760
You'd be all, 'Stress? Never heard of it!'

02:07.860 --> 02:09.620
Aaah, can we just go?

02:09.620 --> 02:11.260
- Come on, Skip, please! - Do it!

02:11.800 --> 02:15.080
Fine! If it'll get us outta here quicker, I'll do it!

02:18.000 --> 02:19.840
Stress Level: Critical.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.220
Oh my goodness. Oh, oh no.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.220
Oh, no, no, no, no.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.940
Sir, are these your stress test results?

02:27.940 --> 02:30.180
Uh, yeah. Why?

02:30.180 --> 02:34.020
I regret to imform you that your stess levels are off the charts.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.560
Woah! How did that even happen?

02:35.560 --> 02:37.020
Yeah, Skips, what made you so stressed?

02:37.020 --> 02:39.840
Look, I'm fine! Can we just go?

02:39.840 --> 02:41.800
No, I'm afraid you're not fine.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.520
Now, uh, may I?

02:47.280 --> 02:49.540
These are indicators of severe stress.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.080
I guess I have been a little stressed out.

02:52.080 --> 02:56.000
Sir, if you fail to reduce your stress level, you will die.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.580
But he's immortal!

02:57.580 --> 02:58.960
Who's the pharmacist here?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.140
Immortality won't save him on this one!

03:01.160 --> 03:02.300
I'm sorry, sir,

03:02.340 --> 03:06.720
but if you don't take immediate acton to reduce your stress levels, you will die.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.620
Now, can I interest you in any bandages or bread strips?

03:11.520 --> 03:13.180
I'm worried about you, Skips.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.580
I think you should take the rest of the day off.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.400
I can't. I've got too much to do today!

03:18.420 --> 03:21.540
No, Skips. You're taking the day off. Doctor's orders.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.940
Fine.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.100
Skips, Skips, Skips!

03:36.160 --> 03:38.920
Skips, you gotta help us! Quick, put this on!

03:41.700 --> 03:44.440
Skips! Skips, I gotta start my show.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.180
Where's my fish? Where's my fish?

03:51.980 --> 03:54.980
Skips, you must play in my booth!

03:54.980 --> 03:58.420
Try to hit the target!

04:02.700 --> 04:05.380
Skips! Test your strength, bro.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.640
Win the bill, Skips.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.940
Win the bill...

04:23.560 --> 04:25.600
All right, guys, here's what's left to do today.

04:26.020 --> 04:27.860
Skips, what are you doing here?

04:27.860 --> 04:28.680
I'm working.

04:28.700 --> 04:31.420
No, you're not. The doctor said you need to take it easy.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.600
He was a pharmacist at the shopping mall.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.540
Trust me, I'm fine.

04:36.540 --> 04:39.120
- You sure? - Yeah, I'm fine.

04:39.260 --> 04:41.800
Alright, but let me know if it's too much.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.980
Ok, so, we have the ice cream social today.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.340
Skips, you're setting up the booth for the ice cream.

04:58.460 --> 05:01.780
Skips! Skips! Skips! Skips!

05:02.340 --> 05:03.840
Skips, are you alright?

05:03.880 --> 05:06.500
Yeah, what's that black gunk? You look like you're gonna die!

05:07.600 --> 05:09.360
It's just stress.

05:09.420 --> 05:10.880
I'm okay.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.680
Skips, you're not okay!

05:12.680 --> 05:14.980
You can't put it off any longer!

05:14.980 --> 05:16.920
You must visit the bell!

05:16.920 --> 05:18.300
Bell? What bell?

05:18.300 --> 05:22.740
There is an ancient stress bell that lies at the top of the Himalaya Mountain.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.200
When it is rang, it'll relief all your stress.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.980
Then why don't you visit the bell sooner?

05:27.980 --> 05:29.720
It's not that simple.

05:29.720 --> 05:34.260
Ringing the bell is five times more dangerous than stress itself.

05:34.380 --> 05:36.740
Usually I can keep my stress under control.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.120
But I guess I let it get outta hand.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.600
Well, ok, you've got to ring this bell.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.060
But how could we get to the Himalayas?

05:42.060 --> 05:43.460
Leave it to me.

06:33.980 --> 06:35.380
There it is.

06:35.420 --> 06:38.200
The ancient stress bell.

06:42.340 --> 06:44.320
Here, skips, we'll help you up there.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.580
Who're all these dead guys?

06:50.680 --> 06:53.880
They must lost their battle against the stress.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.000
Thanks.

07:01.100 --> 07:04.920
Now what I'm about to tell you is very important.

07:05.080 --> 07:09.620
You have to keep your ears covered for as long as the bell is ringing.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.800
Ok, skips.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.620
Rigby, what did I just say?

07:12.620 --> 07:13.660
Keep our ears covered.

07:13.660 --> 07:15.920
For as long as the bell rings. Good.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.120
Now, go, go, get out of here. Far away!

07:19.180 --> 07:20.360
Good luck, skips!

07:50.140 --> 07:52.160
Skips, you forgot your ninja sword!

07:52.760 --> 07:53.820
Rigby, no!

07:54.380 --> 07:55.940
Cover your ears!

07:55.940 --> 07:57.920
- Stop, Rigby! - Cover your ears!

08:00.960 --> 08:01.760
No!

08:11.200 --> 08:12.040
What the heck?!

08:12.220 --> 08:13.880
I got to get that ninja sword!

08:16.000 --> 08:16.900
Skips!

08:21.500 --> 08:23.420
Let me handle this.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.280
We've got to help him!

08:34.280 --> 08:36.559
Yeah! Let's get this thing!

08:50.360 --> 08:52.020
Leave Pops alone!

08:55.660 --> 08:58.100
It's too powerful!

08:58.640 --> 09:01.100
We've got to cut off all his heads.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.440
Time to De-stress!

09:19.260 --> 09:20.120
Hold on!

09:20.900 --> 09:22.900
No, no, no! Rigby, don't!

09:27.260 --> 09:28.920
- Thanks! - No problem!

09:34.800 --> 09:37.460
Benson, take these!

09:57.760 --> 09:58.900
Skips!

10:20.720 --> 10:22.800
- Yeah, way to go! - Skips!

10:22.900 --> 10:25.040
We're sorry we made you so stressed out, Skips.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.400
Nah, forget it.

10:26.420 --> 10:28.540
And thanks for helping me out of here.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.480
This isn't going to happen again.

10:30.540 --> 10:34.420
We could all stand do more of our own work without bothering you for help.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.680
I enjoy helping my friends.

10:36.680 --> 10:40.040
But that might not be such a bad idea.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.120
Oh, my.

10:44.120 --> 10:44.920
What's wrong?

10:44.920 --> 10:46.820
We've got a flat tire.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.140
I'll take care of it.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.680
Here's the tire iron.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.600
I'll grab the jag.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.600
- I got the spare. - Oh, let me help you with that.
