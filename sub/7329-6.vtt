WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:05.681
Always get this much excitement
before you've left port?

00:05.705 --> 00:08.517
-What can I say?
We like to keep on our toes.

00:08.541 --> 00:10.953
This is your final warning.

00:10.977 --> 00:12.922
Identify yourself immediately.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.324
This is your final warning.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.508
Put a light on 'em.

00:19.486 --> 00:21.364
It's just a small sailboat.

00:21.388 --> 00:22.898
It must have slipped
around the curtain.

00:22.922 --> 00:25.134
Looks like
a hand-built Amigo Kit.

00:25.158 --> 00:26.736
But I don't think
we have to worry

00:26.760 --> 00:27.970
about it being an attack...

00:27.994 --> 00:30.963
unless they suicided
a little early.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.111
Two bodies.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.846
It's a bloodbath.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.315
Get divers in the water,
wrangle that craft.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.816
It's a crime scene now.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.419
Looks like it's got your name
on it, Agent Cortez.

00:43.443 --> 00:47.072
It's not my name,
but it is labeled.

01:19.612 --> 01:22.024
You do realize this is a trap?

01:22.048 --> 01:25.294
She's practically inviting us
to mess with her.

01:25.318 --> 01:26.729
Well, what kind of a man
would I be

01:26.753 --> 01:29.298
if I turned down
such an enticing invitation?

01:29.322 --> 01:32.155
Well, you wouldn't be a sucker.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.442
Touch me and die.

01:39.466 --> 01:40.876
Good, you're awake.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.211
Sleeping on the job

01:42.235 --> 01:45.147
isn't going to help you shed
that "probie" tag.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.716
I have been on the job
since 1:00 in the morning

01:47.740 --> 01:49.819
when Gibbs called
me in to cover.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.121
He flew out late last night
with Vance and Ducky...

01:52.145 --> 01:55.124
some case
in the San Diego Harbor.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.359
Ducky means bodies.

01:57.383 --> 01:58.543
They called you to cover?

02:00.320 --> 02:01.878
I believe you call this
"hazing."

02:04.791 --> 02:07.236
We call this the Bill of Rights.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.072
Are you studying to become
a naturalized American citizen?

02:10.096 --> 02:12.475
I have to, if I want to become
an agent.

02:12.499 --> 02:13.609
Good for you, Ziva.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.579
Wait a second, who says we want
her as an American?

02:16.603 --> 02:17.913
And who says you have a say?

02:17.937 --> 02:20.116
A little thing called
the Constitution.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.118
Oh, really? Where?

02:22.142 --> 02:25.454
It's in there, and it talks
about dangerous foreign aliens

02:25.478 --> 02:28.090
stealing our precious
bodily fluids.

02:28.114 --> 02:29.158
That's Dr. Strangelove.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.793
Well, yes,

02:30.817 --> 02:32.595
but it's also, I think,
the 16th Amendment.

02:32.619 --> 02:35.464
"Congress shall have the power
to lay and collect taxes

02:35.488 --> 02:37.666
"on incomes from whatever
source derived,

02:37.690 --> 02:39.468
without apportionment..."

02:39.492 --> 02:41.670
What, are you learning
this stuff through osmosis?

02:41.694 --> 02:42.972
We'll be lucky
to have you, Ziva.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.473
The more the merrier.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.642
Laissez-faire immigration policy

02:46.666 --> 02:48.444
like that is what
Rush Limbaugh says

02:48.468 --> 02:50.946
led to the greatest
economic crisis in the history

02:50.970 --> 02:53.015
- of our fantastic nation.
- Do you have any idea

02:53.039 --> 02:53.984
what you're talking about?

02:54.008 --> 02:55.484
You bet your ass I do.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.453
I'm talking
about the American Dream.

02:57.477 --> 02:58.921
What do you know about
the American Dream?

02:58.945 --> 03:01.457
Well, let's see, I'm
a white male between the ages

03:01.481 --> 03:04.314
of 18 and 49
with a loud mouth and a gun.

03:05.552 --> 03:06.780
I am the American Dream.

03:08.421 --> 03:09.854
Oh, thank God.

03:11.424 --> 03:12.369
Agent McGee.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.669
Two dead bodies, McGee.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.138
Photos coming your way.
Tell Abby to clear the decks.

03:16.162 --> 03:17.740
Okay, what are we
looking at, boss?

03:17.764 --> 03:18.741
I don't know yet.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.709
5:00 a.m., I secured the
crime scene, Director,

03:20.733 --> 03:22.211
and began to process it.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.413
I ran the VIN and found
the boat was registered

03:24.437 --> 03:26.873
to an NCIS Agent Gibbs.

03:28.107 --> 03:29.351
That's you, right?

03:29.375 --> 03:30.486
So what's the deal?

03:30.510 --> 03:31.754
What's with the dead guys?

03:31.778 --> 03:33.923
- Shell casings, Izzy?
- Bagged and tagged, sir.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.026
I take it you didn't
move the bodies.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.027
No, Doctor.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.495
I was trained better than that.

03:39.519 --> 03:41.197
There's no identification

03:41.221 --> 03:43.566
in their pockets,
Jethro, only cash.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.034
Dollars and pesos.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.068
Agent Cortez,

03:46.092 --> 03:47.703
if you didn't know
that this boat,

03:47.727 --> 03:51.507
loaded with dead bodies,
belonged to an NCIS agent,

03:51.531 --> 03:53.676
how do you think it ended up
rolling into a Naval base?

03:53.700 --> 03:55.778
I'd speculate,
given the currents,

03:55.802 --> 03:59.582
it came from the south...
somewhere in Mexico, possibly.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.750
As for who might have
set it on its course,

04:01.774 --> 04:03.185
I wouldn't think to guess.

04:03.209 --> 04:06.622
You usually light the thing
on fire for a Viking funeral.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.375
You know any Vikings
who live in Mexico?

04:11.050 --> 04:15.130
This does have more
of a Wild West feel to it.

04:15.154 --> 04:16.212
Solved it already?

04:17.322 --> 04:19.735
Glad I made the trip.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.038
You've only taken
one vacation this year, Jethro.

04:23.062 --> 04:24.607
Sailed the Gulf route
to Mexico, right?

04:24.631 --> 04:26.609
One-way plane ticket back.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.534
Did I have the fish,
or did I have the lasagne?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.215
I left him with the boat.

04:33.239 --> 04:35.784
He trailered it
to the West Coast.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.053
It was a gift
for my goddaughter.

04:38.077 --> 04:39.622
This is how he repays you.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.257
I got no idea
what's going on here.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.259
You guys already know
who the killer is?

04:43.283 --> 04:46.562
Agent Cortez, use your
contacts with the Federales.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.930
Clear a path for us.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.649
We're headed
south of the border.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.973
It's not going to be necessary.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.328
Are you sure?

05:05.271 --> 05:07.364
NCIS!

05:41.240 --> 05:44.053
Nobody's home.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.022
So where is he?

05:47.046 --> 05:49.173
Where the hell is Mike Franks?

06:09.140 --> 06:10.608
That's...

06:10.930 --> 06:12.499
It's no longer in...

06:13.472 --> 06:14.849
This is Gibbs's boat?

06:14.873 --> 06:16.117
This...

06:16.141 --> 06:18.620
is the crime scene.

06:18.644 --> 06:20.455
It was flown here
in a C-130 cargo plane

06:20.479 --> 06:22.891
along with two bodies
and all the evidence,

06:22.915 --> 06:25.226
and now it is mine.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.629
It is all... mine.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.998
So I can figure out the mystery.

06:30.022 --> 06:30.999
What mystery?

06:31.023 --> 06:32.067
Who the dead guys were?

06:32.091 --> 06:33.568
Or who killed them?

06:33.592 --> 06:36.204
- Or how they ended up on the boat?
- ABBY: Sure.

06:36.228 --> 06:39.708
You guys should work on that,
while I figure out how

06:39.732 --> 06:42.565
he got it out of the basement.

06:45.904 --> 06:48.049
Flagged all of
Franks' known aliases.

06:48.073 --> 06:49.284
No hits yet.

06:49.308 --> 06:51.619
Well, God knows he's
got a head start on us.

06:51.643 --> 06:53.722
Ducky says that those bodies
have been floating around

06:53.746 --> 06:55.323
for at least three days.

06:55.347 --> 06:58.293
AFIS kick out any I.D. s yet?

06:58.317 --> 07:00.628
Calvin Blanchard, Roy Keenan.

07:00.652 --> 07:03.031
They both have
military backgrounds.

07:03.055 --> 07:04.799
They were both
dishonorably discharged.

07:04.823 --> 07:06.368
Blanchard was Army.

07:06.392 --> 07:08.837
Keenan washed out of the Navy
a couple years ago.

07:08.861 --> 07:10.839
Mike Franks was already retired.

07:10.863 --> 07:11.906
So, no professional connection.

07:11.930 --> 07:14.242
Cortez has got a
contact in Mexico,

07:14.266 --> 07:15.910
says these two guys
were going around

07:15.934 --> 07:17.979
asking about Mike
Franks last week.

07:18.003 --> 07:19.748
You sifted through
family members,

07:19.772 --> 07:21.182
common friends in the service?

07:21.206 --> 07:22.550
Couldn't find anyone
with a grudge.

07:22.574 --> 07:25.186
Is that where your gut's
leading you, Gibbs?

07:25.210 --> 07:26.955
We got two guys
looking for Franks,

07:26.979 --> 07:28.556
who really doesn't
want to be found,

07:28.580 --> 07:30.925
and they find him on the
boat, he gets the drop?

07:30.949 --> 07:33.028
Shoved him off and disappeared.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.864
That last part's
the part I really don't like.

07:35.888 --> 07:38.900
If he's gone to ground, that
means this isn't over yet.

07:38.924 --> 07:40.935
You got any idea
where he might be?

07:40.959 --> 07:43.204
No, your guess is
as good as mine, Leon.

07:43.228 --> 07:45.473
For some reason, I
doubt that's true,

07:45.497 --> 07:48.043
but I'm gonna give you
some leeway on this, Gibbs,

07:48.067 --> 07:50.501
since it is your friend,
your boat, your mess.

07:52.871 --> 07:54.916
My patience will
evaporate quickly

07:54.940 --> 07:58.535
if another body shows up
before Franks does.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.095
I've only just begun, Jethro.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.696
I'm afraid you've
jumped the gun.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.099
That's an interesting
choice of words, Duck.

08:11.123 --> 08:13.668
How positively Freudian of me.

08:13.692 --> 08:15.770
Well, I was going
to say "deliberate."

08:15.794 --> 08:17.372
Well, I can tell you
they were shot

08:17.396 --> 08:21.376
over and over and over again...
a total of six in one

08:21.400 --> 08:22.544
and five in the other...

08:22.568 --> 08:25.246
at close range
with a large-caliber weapon.

08:25.270 --> 08:28.249
Reminiscent of the death
of Billy Clanton

08:28.273 --> 08:29.751
at the O.K. Corral.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.386
Got something against
cowboys, Duck?

08:31.410 --> 08:32.921
Well, although I've always been

08:32.945 --> 08:37.058
fond of the way that element
manifests itself in you, Jethro,

08:37.082 --> 08:39.394
I have never been
entirely comfortable

08:39.418 --> 08:42.530
with the psychological
makeup of your mentor.

08:42.554 --> 08:45.133
But Wyatt Earp was friends
with Doc Holliday,

08:45.157 --> 08:46.267
and as they would attest,

08:46.291 --> 08:50.572
there is a fine line
between cowboy and outlaw.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.006
And with the level
of overkill here,

08:52.030 --> 08:53.608
your conclusion is...

08:53.632 --> 08:56.277
Mike Franks has crossed
that line.

08:56.301 --> 08:58.480
Too soon to accuse him

08:58.504 --> 09:01.015
of being an unthinking
killer, Ducky.

09:01.039 --> 09:02.317
No, that's not
what I'm saying at all.

09:02.341 --> 09:03.651
It's quite the opposite.

09:03.675 --> 09:07.322
I think a great deal of thought
went into these killings

09:07.346 --> 09:10.325
and the staging
of the crime scene.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.494
Staging?

09:12.518 --> 09:15.797
Wood splinters
taken from their backsides.

09:15.821 --> 09:20.201
They were dragged onto
the Kelly intentionally.

09:20.225 --> 09:23.238
I'd be surprised if anything
about her discovery

09:23.262 --> 09:25.253
was not intentional.

09:27.332 --> 09:29.511
Abby.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.713
Abbs!

09:31.737 --> 09:33.548
Gibbs.

09:33.572 --> 09:35.984
I assure you, I am
using the utmost care

09:36.008 --> 09:37.886
processing your
beautiful craftsmanship.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.421
It's a "craftsman's ship."

09:40.445 --> 09:42.657
- Abby, the bodies were moved?
- Well, I have blood trails

09:42.681 --> 09:45.460
on the rail and the deck that
suggest they were at least slid.

09:45.484 --> 09:46.461
"Slidden"?

09:46.485 --> 09:49.797
Ducky said that they
had been "slud."

09:49.821 --> 09:51.432
If Ducky said they
"slad" them...

09:51.456 --> 09:53.301
Th-The firefight, Abby,
was it on board?

09:53.325 --> 09:55.670
At first glance, I have a
lot of downward vectors.

09:55.694 --> 09:58.239
Downward, meaning
standing over the top.

09:58.263 --> 10:00.341
Execution style, yeah.

10:00.365 --> 10:01.576
Pow, pow!

10:01.600 --> 10:02.977
So I'm trying to find
corresponding slugs

10:03.001 --> 10:05.180
for all the spent.45 casings.

10:05.204 --> 10:06.948
I would say that it ended here,

10:06.972 --> 10:08.917
but it may not be
where it started.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.152
Another bullet grazed
the port side.

10:11.176 --> 10:12.973
It's smaller caliber
than the others.

10:15.013 --> 10:16.991
- .22.
- Could be.

10:17.015 --> 10:20.728
.22's deteriorate significantly
on impact, so there's no slug,

10:20.752 --> 10:22.185
and it's below the waterline.

10:23.889 --> 10:26.134
Boat wasn't in the water
during the shootout.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.468
Maybe,

10:27.492 --> 10:29.837
or maybe somebody was using
it for target practice.

10:29.861 --> 10:31.206
It's one of the many
inconsistencies

10:31.230 --> 10:32.907
that have to be addressed.

10:32.931 --> 10:35.877
There's-There's angles of
trajectory to calculate,

10:35.901 --> 10:37.612
and all of the
unaccounted-for slugs.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.681
I still have to dig them
out of the woodwork.

10:39.705 --> 10:42.317
I mean, I have
to carefully extract them

10:42.341 --> 10:43.318
from the woodwork.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.953
Take it apart.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.070
Are you sure?

10:48.513 --> 10:51.125
Similar-sized deposits

10:51.149 --> 10:52.594
on roughly
the same dates suggest

10:52.618 --> 10:54.329
that Blanchard and Keenan
worked together,

10:54.353 --> 10:56.397
but the receipts are all cash.

10:56.421 --> 10:58.257
Can't make a financial link
to Franks.

10:59.891 --> 11:02.604
Now, why would two bad guys
go after Mike Franks?

11:02.628 --> 11:05.290
Well, clearly, they don't
know him very well.

11:06.398 --> 11:08.243
Interesting theory, McGee.

11:08.267 --> 11:09.911
I meant that more as a joke.

11:09.935 --> 11:13.314
Some of the greatest ideas
in history started out as jokes.

11:13.338 --> 11:15.383
I mean, look,
you got your mood ring,

11:15.407 --> 11:17.185
pet rock, spork.

11:17.209 --> 11:19.087
Those were all terrible ideas.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.555
Yes.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.023
Terrible ideas

11:22.047 --> 11:24.492
that turned their inventors
into drillionaires.

11:24.516 --> 11:26.294
And that is the
American Dream, Ziva.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.363
And that's why you're never
going to pass that test.

11:28.387 --> 11:31.733
The heart of America is that
any idiot can become a success?

11:31.757 --> 11:33.401
That is exactly right...
'cause we don't live

11:33.425 --> 11:35.436
in an aristocracy
or a meritocracy.

11:35.460 --> 11:36.437
Neither does Israel.

11:36.461 --> 11:38.640
We just have
our capitalist democracy.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.908
Which means that you might
be a pauper today,

11:40.932 --> 11:43.978
you might be living a life
of wall-to-wall desperation.

11:44.002 --> 11:48.249
You might have no friends,
no prospects, no brain, no hope.

11:48.273 --> 11:49.784
But tomorrow?

11:49.808 --> 11:52.553
Tomorrow, you might
win the lottery.

11:52.577 --> 11:54.689
You might slip
on the right driveway.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.491
Tomorrow.

11:56.515 --> 11:58.176
Just like Annie sang.

11:59.217 --> 12:00.361
The comic strip?

12:00.385 --> 12:01.696
Little Orphan Annie.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.331
Curly red hair, no eyeballs.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.999
Adopted by Daddy Warbucks.

12:05.023 --> 12:07.001
And that's the
American dream right there.

12:07.025 --> 12:08.403
Little Orphan Annie.

12:08.427 --> 12:09.704
And me.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.706
Isn't there an essay section
on this citizenship exam?

12:11.730 --> 12:13.641
You should be writing
this stuff down.

12:13.665 --> 12:15.067
It's good.

12:16.201 --> 12:17.312
Shame.

12:17.336 --> 12:18.579
My pencil broke.

12:18.603 --> 12:20.114
Destruction of U.S.
Government property.

12:20.138 --> 12:22.450
That's not going to look
too good on the...

12:22.474 --> 12:24.352
Oh, hey, boss, we've been
researching the dead guys.

12:24.376 --> 12:25.887
McGee had an interesting idea.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.322
Uh, what was that, exactly?

12:27.346 --> 12:29.123
Because you just started talking
a bunch of nonsense

12:29.147 --> 12:30.692
and never actually said
what you were thinking.

12:30.716 --> 12:32.393
What I was thinking, boss,

12:32.417 --> 12:34.862
is maybe they didn't
know Franks... at all.

12:34.886 --> 12:36.183
You know?

12:37.456 --> 12:38.900
Find the connection.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.154
But maybe they...

12:57.509 --> 12:59.520
It's okay.

12:59.544 --> 13:01.556
We're here.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.924
Look, Amira.

13:02.948 --> 13:03.991
It's your godfather.

13:04.015 --> 13:05.059
Can you say hi?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.094
Hello, Amira.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.348
Welcome to my home.

13:11.089 --> 13:12.852
He's right behind us.

13:15.894 --> 13:17.987
You can put her down in there.

13:21.032 --> 13:22.260
Thank you.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.036
Time for bed.

13:31.777 --> 13:34.489
You gonna stand there
glaring at me, probie,

13:34.513 --> 13:36.724
or you gonna give me
a hand with the bags?

13:36.748 --> 13:38.860
Or you gonna shoot me?

13:38.884 --> 13:41.229
No, I thought I'd ask you
a few questions first,

13:41.253 --> 13:42.218
then I may shoot you.

13:42.243 --> 13:43.257
All right.

13:43.282 --> 13:45.432
- Need some answers, Mike.
- All right!

13:45.457 --> 13:48.770
Keep your voice down.

13:48.794 --> 13:52.407
Those two men you killed...
why were they after you?

13:52.431 --> 13:54.365
Damn, probie.

13:55.588 --> 13:57.818
I was hoping you could tell me.

14:05.544 --> 14:09.290
Saturday, I popped in
to the cantina for a mescal.

14:09.314 --> 14:11.559
The bartender, Eddie, tells me

14:11.583 --> 14:15.029
a couple of guys
had been asking around,

14:15.053 --> 14:19.133
looking for a gringo
and two girls.

14:19.157 --> 14:22.970
Claims he did his best
to lead them astray.

14:22.994 --> 14:24.372
You didn't know them.

14:24.396 --> 14:25.606
I'd never seen

14:25.630 --> 14:27.642
either of their faces
before they showed up

14:27.666 --> 14:29.143
on my beach Monday afternoon.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.945
But you were ready for them.

14:30.969 --> 14:32.947
I knew what they wanted.

14:32.971 --> 14:35.550
I could see the cannons
tucked in their backs.

14:35.574 --> 14:36.741
Don't even think about it.

14:41.379 --> 14:44.759
I didn't feel great using
Amira's boat like that.

14:44.783 --> 14:47.628
But I couldn't risk
being investigated

14:47.652 --> 14:48.763
by strangers...

14:48.787 --> 14:51.255
or worse even, the Federales.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.392
So you steered them at the Navy.

14:56.461 --> 14:59.307
If you're gonna be investigated,
better it be by a friend.

14:59.331 --> 15:00.842
Thanks for the honor.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.677
You don't sound too grateful.

15:02.701 --> 15:05.192
You know, Mike...

15:06.805 --> 15:10.084
I'm used to shells
and bodies and cover-ups

15:10.108 --> 15:11.752
as your big finale.

15:11.776 --> 15:13.788
Something starts off like this,

15:13.812 --> 15:15.490
I don't even want to think
about the count.

15:15.514 --> 15:19.227
You can't pin all them
past capers on me, probie.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.362
Not all them messes were mine.

15:21.386 --> 15:23.865
Where was Leyla and Amira?

15:23.889 --> 15:25.766
You don't think I'd...

15:25.790 --> 15:28.402
start throwing shots
with my daughter-in-law

15:28.426 --> 15:32.139
and my granddaughter
not safely tucked away, do you?

15:32.163 --> 15:33.508
I'm not a child.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.209
No, you definitely are not.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.611
You calling me old?

15:36.635 --> 15:39.001
I'm saying there comes a time
to hang up your spurs.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.783
I won't need you or anybody

15:42.807 --> 15:44.519
to tell me when
that is. I'll know.

15:44.543 --> 15:46.020
'Cause I'll be dead.

15:46.044 --> 15:48.342
I hate when you talk like that.

15:50.682 --> 15:54.896
I wouldn't do anything
to put my girls in danger.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.964
That's why I brought them here.

15:56.988 --> 15:59.133
And if you can't find out

15:59.157 --> 16:02.069
who's after me and why, then
I've got no choice, but to...

16:02.093 --> 16:04.071
Mike, do not say it.

16:04.095 --> 16:05.506
Ain't I allowed to say anything?

16:05.530 --> 16:09.243
He's threatening to leave us.

16:09.267 --> 16:12.532
He says it is the only way
to keep us safe... to stay away.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.119
When Liam died...

16:18.143 --> 16:23.057
I made a promise
to my son and to myself.

16:23.081 --> 16:25.208
I protect my family.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.029
Well, from here on,

16:28.053 --> 16:29.816
you leave it
to the professionals.

16:31.523 --> 16:33.367
These two guys
are professionals.

16:33.391 --> 16:34.735
Or were.

16:34.759 --> 16:37.505
PMCs... private
military contractors.

16:37.529 --> 16:39.540
According to a Captain
Hazelton we spoke to,

16:39.564 --> 16:42.677
one of his former classmates,
Blanchard cracked up.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.879
Before he could get his act
together, he was out the door.

16:44.903 --> 16:45.880
Keenan?

16:45.904 --> 16:48.416
Lot of problems with authority.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.185
Well, at least according
to every authority we spoke to.

16:51.209 --> 16:53.254
They both got kicked out
of their respective services,

16:53.278 --> 16:55.289
but they both found
new homes in...

16:55.313 --> 16:56.624
Oh, new homes.

16:56.648 --> 16:57.858
"Give me your tired,

16:57.882 --> 16:59.226
"your poor, your huddled masses

16:59.250 --> 17:00.774
yearning to breathe free..."

17:02.053 --> 17:03.731
The, uh, wretched refuse

17:03.755 --> 17:05.933
ended up on a different
teeming shore.

17:05.957 --> 17:08.202
Working for this man,

17:08.226 --> 17:09.936
Chief Operating Officer

17:09.961 --> 17:13.507
of First Defense PMC,
Colonel Merton Bell.

17:13.531 --> 17:14.742
Bell's based out of Virginia.

17:14.766 --> 17:16.109
He's a former tank commander.

17:16.134 --> 17:18.713
Runs the largest PMC
operating in the Middle East.

17:18.737 --> 17:21.482
Armed security forces protecting
mostly corporate employers.

17:21.506 --> 17:23.384
He also has
governmental contracts,

17:23.407 --> 17:25.252
American and otherwise,

17:25.276 --> 17:26.887
securing reconstruction
projects.

17:26.911 --> 17:28.222
Bring him in.

17:28.246 --> 17:29.557
Hold up a second.

17:29.581 --> 17:32.709
You guys got a location
on Mike Franks?

17:34.019 --> 17:35.196
No.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.220
They don't.

17:38.823 --> 17:40.968
Franks wasn't living
alone on that beach.

17:40.992 --> 17:44.105
He's been with a young woman
for almost three years now.

17:44.129 --> 17:47.074
His daughter-in-law,
Leyla Shakarji.

17:47.098 --> 17:48.943
And her daughter, Amira.

17:48.967 --> 17:52.313
You telling me we can't
find a fugitive on the run

17:52.337 --> 17:54.615
with an Iraqi woman and a child?

17:54.639 --> 17:56.117
No.

17:56.141 --> 17:59.320
I'm saying we've kept our
attention on the dead men.

17:59.344 --> 18:02.390
And now you want to drag
in Colonel Merton Bell.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.524
And that's not
all right with you.

18:03.548 --> 18:05.026
No.

18:05.050 --> 18:07.780
Do I need to explain my problem?

18:10.221 --> 18:13.334
I thought that you were
gonna give me some room on this.

18:13.358 --> 18:14.835
I was, and I am.

18:14.859 --> 18:16.070
But I know Colonel Bell.

18:16.094 --> 18:18.039
We have friends in common
on the Hill.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.608
Then this is about politics.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.143
Your approach lacks finesse.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.377
Finesse?

18:23.401 --> 18:25.079
You could show him
the same courtesy

18:25.103 --> 18:26.781
I showed you
when this case began.

18:26.805 --> 18:29.517
- You mean rub his nose in it?
- You can go heavy if you want,

18:29.541 --> 18:30.951
but we're talking about the man

18:30.975 --> 18:32.219
with the largest
private collection

18:32.243 --> 18:34.288
of legally obtained hardware
in the United States.

18:34.312 --> 18:36.824
He's got Blackhawks
in his front yard.

18:36.848 --> 18:38.626
Are you worried
I'm too blunt, Leon?

18:38.650 --> 18:39.860
You are transparent.

18:39.884 --> 18:42.129
Two of his men are dead;
You know who killed them.

18:42.153 --> 18:44.031
I don't want Colonel Bell
to get the impression

18:44.055 --> 18:45.199
that we're harboring a murderer.

18:45.223 --> 18:46.667
Why would he jump
to that conclusion?

18:46.691 --> 18:48.736
Well, you don't appear
to be devoting too much time

18:48.760 --> 18:49.837
in tracking down his killer.

18:49.861 --> 18:52.106
If I were Bell,
that might make me nervous.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.894
Hell, if I were me,
that might make me nervous.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.181
Mike Franks and his family
are at my house.

19:00.205 --> 19:03.084
And you were about
to send your agents

19:03.108 --> 19:04.752
over there
to keep an eye on them.

19:04.776 --> 19:08.489
Sure... while I find
a more delicate way

19:08.513 --> 19:10.224
to approach Colonel Bell.

19:10.248 --> 19:14.361
That be anything you want
to help me with, maybe?

19:14.385 --> 19:17.843
It's like we were reading
each other's minds.

19:19.891 --> 19:20.868
Hello?

19:20.892 --> 19:21.869
DiNozzo.

19:21.893 --> 19:23.571
Should have told me
you were coming.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.172
I called, and you
didn't pick up.

19:25.196 --> 19:27.041
Not gonna answer
the phone... I'm a fugitive.

19:27.065 --> 19:29.210
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Knock.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.277
Why would I knock?

19:30.301 --> 19:31.712
There's no lock on that door.

19:31.736 --> 19:34.014
Someone may be
on the other side with a gun.

19:34.038 --> 19:35.750
Why would somebody be standing
on the other side with a gun?

19:35.774 --> 19:37.351
Because there's no lock
on the door.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.453
This has been very educational,
gentlemen.

19:39.477 --> 19:41.589
Lady Ziva, glad you're here.

19:41.613 --> 19:42.723
Gibbs send you?

19:42.747 --> 19:44.892
We have been instructed
to sit on the baby.

19:44.916 --> 19:47.228
Well, it's gonna be fine, Mike,
and it's good to see you.

19:47.252 --> 19:48.229
Have a mint.

19:48.253 --> 19:51.932
Got your marching orders, too.
McGee is waiting outside

19:51.956 --> 19:53.234
to drive you to NCIS.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.589
Are you leaving?

19:55.627 --> 19:57.438
You heard the man.

19:57.462 --> 19:59.396
It's gonna be fine.

20:00.565 --> 20:02.260
This is for the best.

20:08.406 --> 20:10.317
Why don't you put something
in front of the door?

20:10.341 --> 20:13.139
No, I'll just stand
here with my gun.

20:18.316 --> 20:19.994
That guy.

20:20.018 --> 20:22.930
Well, I'm back and forth to Iraq
and Afghanistan so much,

20:22.954 --> 20:25.633
it's practically
my office now, Leon.

20:25.657 --> 20:26.834
Thank you.

20:26.858 --> 20:28.803
Sure.

20:28.827 --> 20:31.338
Keenan and Blanchard
were over there?

20:31.362 --> 20:33.507
Public interface, mainly.

20:33.531 --> 20:34.842
We meet with the local

20:34.866 --> 20:36.644
tribal leaders
on a weekly basis,

20:36.668 --> 20:38.312
get a sense of what's going on.

20:38.336 --> 20:39.613
Threats to look out for.

20:39.637 --> 20:40.915
No, it's not all negative.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.083
Sometimes, the chatter
is a little more innocuous.

20:43.107 --> 20:46.287
People talk about a need
to build a new school.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.856
Gives us an opportunity
to combine our efforts.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.091
Increases our odds of success.

20:51.115 --> 20:52.693
They were good at their jobs?

20:52.717 --> 20:54.461
I'm sure I don't detect a note

20:54.485 --> 20:57.198
of surprise in your voice,
Special Agent Gibbs.

20:57.222 --> 20:59.733
All my men are outstanding.

20:59.757 --> 21:02.055
United States Armed
Forces disagrees.

21:03.161 --> 21:06.407
My company may not adhere
to the same...

21:06.431 --> 21:08.776
some might say
punitive restrictions.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.078
Nevertheless,
we seem to be picking up

21:11.102 --> 21:13.848
more and more
of their responsibilities.

21:13.872 --> 21:16.650
Every time the U.S. reduces
the number of troops deployed,

21:16.674 --> 21:18.252
you have to increase your hires.

21:18.276 --> 21:19.553
Gibbs.

21:19.577 --> 21:20.921
It's understandable, Director.

21:20.945 --> 21:24.625
Jarheads and mercs
are like oil and water.

21:24.649 --> 21:26.694
Although, I've got
some of my best men

21:26.718 --> 21:28.495
off the Marine Corps'
scrap heap.

21:28.519 --> 21:29.864
The men you hire

21:29.888 --> 21:32.333
have histories of violence,
insubordination,

21:32.357 --> 21:34.134
mental problems.

21:34.158 --> 21:36.470
What do you have to do
to be disqualified?

21:36.494 --> 21:39.406
If you intend to cast aspersions
on the names of two dead men...

21:39.430 --> 21:42.309
two of my men... I'd prefer
you just cut to the chase

21:42.333 --> 21:43.677
and ask the real question.

21:43.701 --> 21:46.480
Okay. Did you know two
of your men were in Mexico

21:46.504 --> 21:47.882
carrying weapons you furnished?

21:47.906 --> 21:49.016
Of course I did.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.133
They informed me
when they accepted the contract.

21:53.077 --> 21:55.756
They were carrying out
a contract on Mike Franks?

21:55.780 --> 21:57.714
Who the hell is Mike Franks?

22:03.288 --> 22:05.866
Well, thank you for your
cooperation, Colonel Bell.

22:05.890 --> 22:08.502
I expect you'll keep
me apprised, Director.

22:08.526 --> 22:10.756
Justice needs to be done here.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.862
Is that the bad guy?

22:16.868 --> 22:20.463
Hey, probie, is that the guy
that put the hit on me?

22:24.575 --> 22:26.520
No one was after you.

22:26.544 --> 22:28.722
What?

22:28.746 --> 22:30.591
You were just
the only lead they had.

22:30.615 --> 22:32.927
Who's "they"?

22:32.951 --> 22:34.962
Leyla and Amira's family
from Iraq.

22:34.986 --> 22:37.352
They hired those two PMCs
to find them.

22:38.389 --> 22:40.267
And you killed 'em.

22:40.291 --> 22:44.625
You want to know who the real
bad guy is here, Mike?

22:46.230 --> 22:48.858
Go look in the damn mirror.

22:58.442 --> 23:00.720
You don't look very
remorseful, Mike.

23:00.744 --> 23:02.489
- About what?
- These two men

23:02.513 --> 23:04.190
were hired by your
daughter-in-law's family

23:04.214 --> 23:05.392
to find her.

23:05.416 --> 23:07.160
There's no reason to believe

23:07.184 --> 23:09.763
that they meant her
or you any harm.

23:09.787 --> 23:11.464
It appears...

23:11.488 --> 23:13.718
you killed them in cold blood.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.089
That how it appears to you?

23:19.397 --> 23:21.608
I can't say how it went,
Mike. I wasn't there.

23:21.632 --> 23:23.677
You were there
when Leyla first came over.

23:23.701 --> 23:26.380
You know a thing or two
about her family.

23:26.404 --> 23:28.982
They disowned her.

23:29.006 --> 23:30.017
Disowned her

23:30.041 --> 23:33.554
because she got pregnant
by my son, Liam.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.955
That's not family.

23:34.979 --> 23:37.491
Those two guys were doing
Shada Shakarji's bidding.

23:37.515 --> 23:39.326
Don't expect me to cry for them.

23:39.350 --> 23:40.494
Shada Shakarji

23:40.518 --> 23:42.462
is Leyla's family?

23:42.486 --> 23:43.630
Her mother.

23:43.654 --> 23:44.831
Hard-as-nails matriarch

23:44.855 --> 23:47.034
of one of the most prominent
tribes in Iraq.

23:47.058 --> 23:48.202
It's unorthodox for a woman

23:48.226 --> 23:49.803
to be in that position
of prominence.

23:49.827 --> 23:52.739
Didn't exactly run
for the office.

23:52.763 --> 23:54.808
Shada buried her father,

23:54.832 --> 23:58.979
her brothers and her husband
in the war with Iran.

23:59.003 --> 24:01.682
Lost her oldest son to Saddam,

24:01.706 --> 24:03.350
and a couple of more since.

24:03.374 --> 24:04.585
Family was about out of men.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.486
But not memory.

24:06.510 --> 24:09.122
She's a vindictive old sow.

24:09.146 --> 24:12.226
And when Amty Shada cuts
you off, you're not supposed

24:12.250 --> 24:15.596
to get a happily-ever-after
on a beach in Mexico.

24:15.620 --> 24:18.899
She's willing to pay
to drag 'em back home?

24:18.923 --> 24:22.518
She's not gonna flinch at
a couple of dead guns for hire.

24:25.296 --> 24:27.274
What'd you use?

24:27.298 --> 24:29.009
What?

24:29.033 --> 24:31.111
What'd you use?!

24:31.135 --> 24:32.613
.45.

24:32.637 --> 24:33.695
How many shots?

24:35.740 --> 24:37.884
I used the boat as a decoy.

24:37.908 --> 24:41.188
Left the radio on the deck
and an open beer.

24:41.212 --> 24:43.257
They went for it
with guns drawn.

24:43.281 --> 24:44.491
Emptied my mag from the porch,

24:44.515 --> 24:46.793
put two in the big guy
and three in the other.

24:46.817 --> 24:49.563
Reloaded, dragged 'em on board,
and gave 'em each

24:49.587 --> 24:51.398
three more for good measure.

24:51.422 --> 24:53.447
It was self-defense.

25:02.967 --> 25:04.764
Take his statement.

25:11.642 --> 25:14.110
The evidence better confirm
every bit of it.

25:25.456 --> 25:26.533
Abby!

25:26.557 --> 25:28.218
Abby, what are you doing?

25:30.161 --> 25:31.471
Abby? Abby!

25:31.495 --> 25:34.007
What are you doing?

25:34.031 --> 25:35.008
He told me to do it.

25:35.032 --> 25:36.610
I had to do it... but I'm trying

25:36.634 --> 25:38.011
to do it like an archaeologist.

25:38.035 --> 25:39.079
I'm keeping very careful notes

25:39.103 --> 25:40.147
of where everything came from,

25:40.171 --> 25:41.848
and I'm sure I can put it back

25:41.872 --> 25:43.116
together again when I'm done.

25:43.140 --> 25:44.451
You're using a chainsaw.

25:44.475 --> 25:46.687
Well, it's not like there
was a zipper, McGee.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.455
I mean, I was
hoping for a zipper,

25:48.479 --> 25:51.325
or some sort of system
of-of dowels and slots.

25:51.349 --> 25:53.026
Well, please tell me
it was worth it.

25:53.050 --> 25:55.729
I found a secret stash box.

25:55.753 --> 25:57.230
Grease residue suggests that

25:57.254 --> 25:58.465
Franks kept a gun in there.

25:58.489 --> 25:59.700
The guy keeps a gun everywhere.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.902
Took us 15 minutes
to get through security.

26:01.926 --> 26:03.837
Franks was smuggling a piece?

26:03.861 --> 26:04.838
Was it a.22?

26:04.862 --> 26:07.007
No. It was a...
saw blade, curled

26:07.031 --> 26:08.709
in the hollowed-out
heel of his boot.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.035
.22? I don't think he carries
anything that small.

26:12.303 --> 26:14.748
I found this mangled
piece of lead

26:14.772 --> 26:16.583
embedded deep
in the floorboards.

26:16.607 --> 26:18.652
I think it's two slugs
smashed together.

26:18.676 --> 26:20.354
Like boom-boom.

26:20.378 --> 26:21.955
- One bullet hit another bullet?
- Yeah.

26:21.979 --> 26:24.091
It's an impossible shot.

26:24.115 --> 26:27.448
Yeah... if they were both
in the air at the same time.

26:30.388 --> 26:33.100
It's a bullet in a bullet?

26:33.124 --> 26:34.568
Abby's analyzing it now,

26:34.592 --> 26:38.305
but if it is a piece
of a.22 in a.45, then...

26:38.329 --> 26:39.806
You broke up there.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.074
What are you saying?

26:41.098 --> 26:43.210
I can't hear you, McGee.
I'm in the basement.

26:43.234 --> 26:45.011
Why?

26:45.035 --> 26:46.446
'Cause I don't want
to talk about the case

26:46.470 --> 26:48.515
in front of Leyla and the kid.

26:48.539 --> 26:50.384
Listen, Tony,
this is really important.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.986
I need you to check
the seams of the walls.

26:53.010 --> 26:54.187
The walls?

26:54.211 --> 26:56.147
Well, do they appear
to be removable?

26:57.348 --> 26:58.425
Abby...

26:58.449 --> 26:59.659
Or-or a tunnel, maybe.

26:59.683 --> 27:01.795
Could be hidden underneath
something on the floor.

27:01.819 --> 27:04.598
Something that looks
like it doesn't belong.

27:04.622 --> 27:06.366
Actually, I think.

27:06.390 --> 27:09.136
Colonel Hogan has got a radio
in the coffee pot,

27:09.160 --> 27:12.005
but the tunnel
might have been filled in.

27:12.029 --> 27:13.573
I saw a video on the internet
once where this guy...

27:13.597 --> 27:15.709
he built a Lamborghini in his
basement... they had to pull off

27:15.733 --> 27:17.034
half the house to get it out.

27:18.202 --> 27:19.999
Was that a ding?

27:23.707 --> 27:25.986
I think we've got
another shooter.

27:26.010 --> 27:28.889
You have very
peaceful eyes, Amira.

27:28.913 --> 27:30.090
Do you know that?

27:30.114 --> 27:31.391
Yes, she does.

27:31.415 --> 27:35.429
I left Iraq because I
didn't want to expose her

27:35.453 --> 27:37.964
to the violence
I saw as a child.

27:37.988 --> 27:42.569
I want that peace to last
in her eyes forever.

27:42.593 --> 27:45.426
You made difficult choices,
for both of you.

27:47.131 --> 27:49.810
Sometimes the most significant
moments happen in your life

27:49.834 --> 27:51.478
without any choice at all.

27:51.502 --> 27:55.615
Like your father.

27:55.639 --> 27:57.984
I knew the cost
of even talking to Liam,

27:58.008 --> 28:00.020
but I couldn't help it.

28:00.044 --> 28:01.922
The feeling was irresistible.

28:01.946 --> 28:04.039
It was love at first sight.

28:05.249 --> 28:06.927
Maybe.

28:06.951 --> 28:09.511
Do you miss your homeland?

28:11.755 --> 28:14.301
It was difficult
to leave it all behind.

28:14.325 --> 28:18.038
But the right reasons
made it easier.

28:18.062 --> 28:20.207
Ziva's trying to pick up
and start over again.

28:20.231 --> 28:23.009
Rebuild... again.

28:23.033 --> 28:24.728
Yes.

28:30.407 --> 28:32.486
What's your place
like in Mexico?

28:32.510 --> 28:34.171
It is simple.

28:35.112 --> 28:37.791
Just enough room
for the three of us.

28:37.815 --> 28:40.306
Were you inside when the, uh...

28:42.019 --> 28:43.486
when it started?

28:44.522 --> 28:45.999
Yes.

28:46.023 --> 28:47.888
What'd you do?

28:50.427 --> 28:52.973
I did what any mother would do.

28:52.997 --> 28:54.692
I ran to my daughter.

28:55.733 --> 28:58.224
Where was she?

29:03.107 --> 29:05.519
Leyla,

29:05.543 --> 29:08.205
where was Amira?

29:11.882 --> 29:13.994
Shada Shakarji

29:14.018 --> 29:16.329
has become one of the
most outspoken voices

29:16.353 --> 29:18.698
of the Iraqi tribes
during the past few years.

29:18.722 --> 29:19.966
And she's suffered for it.

29:19.990 --> 29:21.801
Lots of enemies
among the old guard.

29:21.825 --> 29:24.337
- I can tell you all this.
- Keep writing.

29:24.361 --> 29:26.606
Bombing last year.

29:26.630 --> 29:28.108
Killed 40,
including her oldest son,

29:28.132 --> 29:29.376
believed to be the target.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.078
Increased security
considerably since then.

29:32.102 --> 29:34.281
That's where she came in contact
with First Defense PMC.

29:34.305 --> 29:35.606
And Colonel Bell.

29:37.441 --> 29:39.553
Gibbs' desk.

29:39.577 --> 29:40.854
Oh, hi. It's Ducky.

29:40.878 --> 29:42.489
- Ducky for you.
- I was looking for Jethro.

29:42.513 --> 29:44.724
Is he around?
It's rather important...

29:44.748 --> 29:46.359
Yeah, Duck.

29:46.383 --> 29:48.361
Oh, uh, could you
come down, please?

29:48.385 --> 29:49.477
All right.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.770
Ah, Jethro.

29:56.794 --> 29:59.839
You know we have
enormous respect for you,

29:59.863 --> 30:02.042
and for the loyalty

30:02.066 --> 30:05.045
that you exhibit
toward your friends.

30:05.069 --> 30:07.380
Gibbs...

30:07.404 --> 30:10.016
we love you very, very much.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.118
What the hell is this?

30:12.142 --> 30:13.820
This is an intervention.

30:13.844 --> 30:16.222
Your own history
with Mike Franks

30:16.246 --> 30:18.792
is having a... a blinding effect

30:18.816 --> 30:20.894
on your skill
as an investigator.

30:20.918 --> 30:23.597
It's too much for
any man to take. I mean...

30:23.621 --> 30:26.066
I mean, he busted the gut;
The guy's a gut-buster.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.034
He's like a six-foot
hero, like...

30:28.058 --> 30:29.235
like, uh, like the sandwich.

30:29.259 --> 30:30.470
Not... he's not six foot,

30:30.494 --> 30:31.791
and he's-he's not a hero.

30:32.930 --> 30:34.441
He's lying to us.

30:34.465 --> 30:35.542
It's insulting enough
when people

30:35.566 --> 30:36.943
that we don't know
try this stuff.

30:36.967 --> 30:39.713
But a colleague, I mean,
a supposed friend, it's...

30:39.737 --> 30:42.616
well, it's simply a betrayal.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.017
.45 slug, .45 slug,

30:44.041 --> 30:47.120
.45 slug, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

30:47.144 --> 30:48.688
The pathways they took

30:48.712 --> 30:51.324
through the bodies...
all of them

30:51.348 --> 30:52.592
straight downwards.

30:52.616 --> 30:54.894
Yes, incredibly destructive.

30:54.918 --> 30:56.663
We also found this.

30:56.687 --> 30:58.632
Partial.22 slug.

30:58.656 --> 30:59.866
And there's more.

30:59.890 --> 31:01.668
We believe that

31:01.692 --> 31:03.370
what happened was this...

31:03.394 --> 31:06.272
Somebody else shot them...
with a rifle.

31:06.296 --> 31:07.641
A.22 long.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.009
And then Franks shot

31:09.033 --> 31:10.276
through the gunshot wounds

31:10.300 --> 31:12.530
of the already-dead men
to destroy the evidence.

31:13.537 --> 31:17.701
Mike Franks
did not kill these guys.

31:29.586 --> 31:31.530
Careful.

31:31.554 --> 31:34.567
I've been writing on
this thing all day.

31:34.591 --> 31:37.151
I was just about to sign it.

31:38.495 --> 31:41.540
My second year,
we caught a case, you and I.

31:41.564 --> 31:44.644
A sergeant and his best friend

31:44.668 --> 31:47.647
took his little boy duck-hunting
for the first time.

31:47.671 --> 31:50.783
Geese. They were
chasing wild geese.

31:50.807 --> 31:52.318
Yeah. I know, Mike.

31:52.342 --> 31:54.020
You made that joke a few times.

31:54.044 --> 31:55.187
You laughed each time.

31:55.211 --> 31:57.323
Well, I had to,
I worked for you then.

31:57.347 --> 31:59.158
Not anymore.

31:59.182 --> 32:03.329
That sergeant dragged
his friend home that day

32:03.353 --> 32:05.331
missing half his chest.

32:05.355 --> 32:07.700
Dead.

32:07.724 --> 32:09.715
Bird shot everywhere.

32:11.094 --> 32:12.905
Shotgun blast, close range.

32:12.929 --> 32:14.707
Nothing accidental about it,

32:14.731 --> 32:16.722
but you wouldn't charge him.

32:18.401 --> 32:20.513
It was accidental.

32:20.537 --> 32:22.915
Little boy's gun went off.

32:22.939 --> 32:26.670
Shot that guy
right through the heart.

32:28.111 --> 32:30.807
And I've been thinking
about that a lot lately.

32:32.215 --> 32:37.430
That sergeant standing over
the body of his best friend.

32:37.454 --> 32:40.099
His ten-year-old son's
just killed him.

32:40.123 --> 32:43.035
He's feeling like
it's his fault.

32:43.059 --> 32:45.671
Like he failed them both.

32:45.695 --> 32:48.874
Only one thing left
for him to do.

32:48.898 --> 32:52.678
And that's to protect his son
from what's coming next.

32:52.702 --> 32:55.715
Put his shotgun into the wound

32:55.739 --> 32:57.730
and fires.

32:59.209 --> 33:01.677
He's thinkin' he'll take
the bullet himself.

33:08.184 --> 33:10.379
This ain't gonna work.

33:17.660 --> 33:19.651
When'd you figure it?

33:20.697 --> 33:22.074
Boss?

33:22.098 --> 33:24.510
Boss, you wanted me
to let you know

33:24.534 --> 33:27.747
if I found anything interesting
about Shada Shakarji.

33:27.771 --> 33:30.483
According to this
flight information,

33:30.507 --> 33:32.618
she is on a commercial
plane right now.

33:32.642 --> 33:35.110
Grandma's on her way to D.C.

33:45.889 --> 33:47.880
I am Shada Shakarji.

33:49.893 --> 33:52.371
Welcome to Washington.

33:52.395 --> 33:54.386
Car's right out front.

33:55.432 --> 33:57.777
What is she doing here?

33:57.801 --> 34:00.045
Oh, just taking a hands-on
approach with her daughter.

34:00.069 --> 34:03.129
Her first attempt
lacked in finesse.

34:05.675 --> 34:07.666
How's the statement
coming, Mike?

34:08.978 --> 34:10.989
It was a load of crap.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.224
Probie called me on it.

34:12.248 --> 34:13.492
You lied to us?

34:13.516 --> 34:16.562
I'm sure you're shocked
and appalled, Director.

34:16.585 --> 34:17.797
I'm relieved.

34:17.821 --> 34:20.132
Of all your unsavory
character traits,

34:20.156 --> 34:21.801
I find that one
the most palatable.

34:21.824 --> 34:23.636
At least there aren't
any more bodies.

34:23.659 --> 34:26.405
There might be...
if you turn her loose.

34:26.429 --> 34:29.074
What are we going
to hold her on, Mike?

34:29.098 --> 34:31.110
She hasn't committed a crime.

34:31.134 --> 34:32.445
Conspiracy to be a bitch?

34:32.469 --> 34:35.447
It's the one thing
he told the truth about.

34:35.472 --> 34:38.464
He is protecting his family.

34:40.443 --> 34:42.455
Well, I guess that's
what this is.

34:42.478 --> 34:44.469
It's a family thing.

34:46.949 --> 34:48.761
Why don't you get in there

34:48.784 --> 34:51.413
and see if you can work
it out with the in-laws?

34:52.956 --> 34:56.551
You do still know your
way around the room, don't you?

35:18.214 --> 35:20.059
You know who I am.

35:20.083 --> 35:23.143
The Greeks would
call you Charon.

35:24.521 --> 35:28.000
Your boat conducts
the dead to hell,

35:28.024 --> 35:31.003
leaving a trail of misery
in your wake.

35:31.027 --> 35:32.304
Yeah, lady.

35:32.328 --> 35:35.661
And you're all
smiles and sunshine.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.412
I've been tracking
your every move

35:40.436 --> 35:43.082
since the day your
accursed offspring

35:43.106 --> 35:44.583
ruined my daughter.

35:44.607 --> 35:47.853
I have never hit a woman, but...

35:47.877 --> 35:48.854
I find that

35:48.878 --> 35:51.557
- hard to believe.
- I'm finding it hard to believe

35:51.581 --> 35:52.815
you're actually a woman.

35:53.850 --> 35:56.318
You manipulative, stubborn hag!

36:00.223 --> 36:02.501
You hide my family from me.

36:02.525 --> 36:04.470
You disowned them.

36:04.494 --> 36:06.052
So?

36:09.032 --> 36:11.159
Things change.

36:13.803 --> 36:16.615
I have lost too much family

36:16.639 --> 36:19.451
that I can never get back.

36:19.475 --> 36:22.454
She is my child.

36:22.478 --> 36:25.558
And the little girl
is my granddaughter.

36:25.582 --> 36:27.573
My blood.

36:35.091 --> 36:37.603
You sent gunmen
to abduct Leyla and Amira.

36:37.627 --> 36:40.272
What were your intentions,
to punish them?

36:40.296 --> 36:42.942
To rescue...

36:42.966 --> 36:44.534
from you.

36:47.837 --> 36:50.316
If there is a chance
to reconcile,

36:50.340 --> 36:52.885
I am willing to...

36:52.909 --> 36:54.900
travel the distance.

36:56.946 --> 36:59.425
You put them in jeopardy.

36:59.449 --> 37:02.027
It would never have
turned violent...

37:02.051 --> 37:04.229
I was assured of it...

37:04.253 --> 37:06.632
if not for you.

37:06.656 --> 37:08.067
I got news for you, lady.

37:08.091 --> 37:10.803
I didn't pull a gun on them.

37:10.827 --> 37:13.421
I didn't fire the first shot.

37:15.465 --> 37:16.542
Shut up.

37:16.566 --> 37:18.557
I don't believe you.

37:20.603 --> 37:22.915
I'm not proud to cop to this.

37:22.939 --> 37:25.584
I wasn't ready for them;
I didn't get tipped off.

37:25.608 --> 37:27.686
Hell, I never even
heard them coming.

37:27.710 --> 37:31.578
Your, uh, defenses were down?

37:33.349 --> 37:36.862
I was playing
with my granddaughter.

37:36.886 --> 37:39.632
We were up in the boat.

37:39.656 --> 37:43.469
She wanted to paint
her name on the side.

37:43.493 --> 37:46.105
Then these two guys
are standing there,

37:46.129 --> 37:48.574
pointing guns up at me.

37:48.598 --> 37:50.576
Leyla noticed 'em
from the house.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.212
My Leyla?

37:53.236 --> 37:55.014
My meek,

37:55.038 --> 37:56.749
quiet, little girl?

37:56.773 --> 38:00.319
Unloaded six shots rapid-fire
from a.22 hunting rifle.

38:00.343 --> 38:01.776
Five hits.

38:02.812 --> 38:05.124
She knows to shoot?

38:05.148 --> 38:07.159
I taught her.

38:07.183 --> 38:09.328
Never underestimate a mama bear

38:09.352 --> 38:11.363
when her cub's in danger.

38:11.387 --> 38:14.379
That I believe.

38:19.262 --> 38:23.208
They're safer with me
than they are with you.

38:23.232 --> 38:25.811
I can't

38:25.835 --> 38:28.065
let you pull them back
into the fold.

38:30.106 --> 38:31.417
What?

38:31.441 --> 38:33.432
What is it?

38:35.144 --> 38:37.135
I made payment already.

38:38.481 --> 38:40.559
Colonel Bell assures me

38:40.583 --> 38:42.517
that the contract
will be completed.

38:47.023 --> 38:49.668
She went up the ladder
after the first guys failed,

38:49.692 --> 38:50.903
directly to Bell.

38:50.927 --> 38:52.404
Guy's got nothing but his name.

38:52.428 --> 38:54.640
He takes the hit
if he takes a job,

38:54.664 --> 38:55.874
can't get it done.

38:55.898 --> 38:59.445
With that chip on his shoulder,
not even she can call him off.

38:59.469 --> 39:00.946
Got it, Gibbs.

39:00.970 --> 39:02.181
Trouble brewing?

39:02.205 --> 39:04.183
Where's Amira?

39:04.207 --> 39:05.451
She's upstairs, sleeping.

39:05.475 --> 39:06.475
All right.

39:08.077 --> 39:09.822
Take her downstairs.

39:09.846 --> 39:11.990
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
you know how to shoot?

39:12.014 --> 39:13.675
Yes, she does.

39:17.386 --> 39:18.921
- Tony!
- Look out!

39:22.425 --> 39:24.470
Go, go! Get down on the floor!

39:24.494 --> 39:26.905
Hands where I can see 'em!

39:26.929 --> 39:27.973
Got eyes on one.

39:27.997 --> 39:29.441
Stay down! Don't move!

39:29.465 --> 39:32.059
Keep looking at the floor!

39:33.169 --> 39:33.913
We're secure.

39:33.937 --> 39:35.047
Ziva?

39:35.071 --> 39:36.181
Is that you?

39:36.205 --> 39:37.182
Damon?

39:37.206 --> 39:39.084
Wait a second,
you know this guy?

39:39.108 --> 39:41.086
Corporal Damon Werth.

39:41.110 --> 39:43.340
USMC. Dishonorably discharged.

39:44.046 --> 39:46.024
Oh, yeah.

39:46.048 --> 39:46.860
Give me your hands!

39:46.884 --> 39:48.026
What are you doing here?

39:48.050 --> 39:49.428
This is Gibbs's living room.

39:49.452 --> 39:50.763
What are you doing here?

39:50.787 --> 39:53.098
Rescuing a kidnapped little girl
and her mother.

39:53.122 --> 39:54.466
I'm sorry to tell you,

39:54.490 --> 39:57.402
but y-you're
actually abducting them.

39:57.426 --> 39:59.738
Hey, Werth, cut the chitchat.
Just secure the prisoner.

39:59.762 --> 40:01.473
I can't. We're making a mistake.

40:01.497 --> 40:03.242
Bell's got a lotta money
riding on this job.

40:03.266 --> 40:04.826
We're gonna finish it
with or without...

40:13.209 --> 40:14.219
I think we should hear them out.

40:14.243 --> 40:15.505
Don't you?

40:32.061 --> 40:33.872
You get the girls, Corporal?

40:33.896 --> 40:35.040
You finish the job?

40:35.064 --> 40:36.554
Yeah, I'm finished
with the job, sir.

40:39.235 --> 40:40.212
What have you done, son?

40:40.236 --> 40:41.313
I quit.

40:41.337 --> 40:42.881
And that's a shame,

40:42.905 --> 40:44.716
because he's
a pretty loyal guy, too.

40:44.740 --> 40:46.885
Made a mess out of my house.

40:46.909 --> 40:48.587
Somebody's going to have
to clean that up.

40:48.611 --> 40:50.889
You want to go punch for punch
with me, Gibbs?

40:50.913 --> 40:53.458
Keep in mind, I got
a big arsenal behind me.

40:53.482 --> 40:55.828
I wouldn't worry, your suit
covers it up very nicely.

40:55.852 --> 40:58.664
Sorry, I'm a little wacky,
'cause of the flash-bang

40:58.688 --> 41:00.499
your boys threw at us.

41:00.523 --> 41:01.767
Perhaps my men were
overexuberant

41:01.791 --> 41:03.202
in the pursuit of their task.

41:03.226 --> 41:07.272
Personally, however,
I have not broken any laws.

41:07.296 --> 41:08.640
U.S. laws.

41:08.664 --> 41:10.676
But the Federales
want to talk to you.

41:10.700 --> 41:13.779
Yeah, turns out bounty hunting
is illegal south of the border.

41:13.803 --> 41:15.361
God bless Mexico.

41:17.406 --> 41:19.384
I tell my men, you take a swing,

41:19.408 --> 41:21.086
make sure you connect
hard enough

41:21.110 --> 41:22.338
to put the other guy down.

41:23.379 --> 41:25.357
Good advice.

41:25.381 --> 41:27.372
Put your hands behind your back.

41:32.588 --> 41:35.580
You should also tell 'em
to get a haircut.

41:36.859 --> 41:38.604
You, um,

41:38.628 --> 41:41.062
think the grandparents
can work this out?

41:45.835 --> 41:49.815
My dad told me a story
once, oh, dates back

41:49.839 --> 41:53.552
maybe... 30 years
after the Civil War.

41:53.576 --> 41:57.489
My great, great grandmother
and grandfather

41:57.513 --> 42:00.243
had fathers that fought
on either side.

42:01.918 --> 42:03.762
These two old warriors,

42:03.786 --> 42:07.266
they probably shot at
each other on the battlefield.

42:07.290 --> 42:10.769
They couldn't even
look at each other

42:10.793 --> 42:12.404
at their own kids' wedding.

42:12.428 --> 42:17.142
But they did come to live with
each other in the same house.

42:17.166 --> 42:18.644
# I'm goin' down south... #

42:18.668 --> 42:23.515
And they spent every day
for the rest of their lives

42:23.539 --> 42:27.152
on the front porch,

42:27.176 --> 42:30.322
in a couple of wicker rocking
chairs rocking back and forth.

42:30.346 --> 42:33.144
Well, here's hoping.

42:35.184 --> 42:37.396
# Well, I knew it this morning #

42:37.420 --> 42:39.731
We got better things to do

42:39.755 --> 42:42.167
than be Franks'
family counselor.

42:42.191 --> 42:44.369
Yeah.

42:44.393 --> 42:47.072
I guess they worked out
their differences,

42:47.096 --> 42:48.106
your relatives.

42:48.130 --> 42:50.175
They mellowed with time, right?

42:50.199 --> 42:53.178
Way I heard it,

42:53.202 --> 42:55.781
those two never said a word.

42:55.805 --> 42:59.741
# My clothes were
hanging out... #
