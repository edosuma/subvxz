00:01.833 --> 00:03.208
[narrator]
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.208 --> 00:05.375
[Apocalypse]
I am the instrument

00:05.375 --> 00:08.083
to purify the world.

00:08.083 --> 00:12.875
The evil of human and mutant
must be cut away!

00:12.875 --> 00:16.083
Those who oppose me
shall perish

00:16.083 --> 00:18.750
through my agents
of destruction.

00:18.750 --> 00:22.833
Famine. Pestilence. War.

00:22.833 --> 00:27.291
And my greatest creation,
Death.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.583
This is what
I've feared the most,

00:29.583 --> 00:31.583
a powerful mutant

00:31.583 --> 00:34.625
driven completely mad
by his powers.

00:34.625 --> 00:39.375
I am Apocalypse!

00:39.375 --> 00:45.166
All who oppose me
shall be crushed!

00:46.083 --> 00:49.083
[theme music playing]

01:55.750 --> 01:59.208
[footsteps]

02:20.208 --> 02:23.875
Tyler, you must understand
why tonight is so important.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.583
For over 5,000 years,

02:26.583 --> 02:29.125
the world has had to put up
with Apocalypse's brutalities.

02:29.958 --> 02:31.875
You know what
he's meant to us.

02:33.083 --> 02:35.125
We're gonna stop him tonight,
Father, I can feel it.

02:35.125 --> 02:36.875
He's in the pyramid,

02:37.375 --> 02:41.166
forcing life through
those decaying veins of his.

02:41.166 --> 02:44.250
Five hundred centuries
of research points to it.

02:44.250 --> 02:47.333
We get this chance
once in a lifetime.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.125
We leave victorious.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.000
Or we don't leave at all.

03:25.958 --> 03:27.625
[Cable]
Watch your backsides!

03:27.625 --> 03:30.750
Apocalypse is vulnerable now,
but he's not stupid.

03:44.208 --> 03:47.458
The door to his Lazarus Chamber
ought to be here.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.708
Computer,
how do we get inside?

03:55.250 --> 03:57.708
[computer]
Analyzing. One moment.

03:57.708 --> 04:00.375
Locate the snake glyph.
Press it.

04:03.958 --> 04:06.000
[CABLE] Ah!
I hate snakes.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.458
Cover me.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.416
Not a great start.

04:14.708 --> 04:16.583
[Apocalypse]
Feeble mutant!

04:16.583 --> 04:21.000
You dare challenge
Apocalypse again.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.458
Blasphemer!

04:23.125 --> 04:27.250
You defile
my secret chamber.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.333
[grunts]

04:37.375 --> 04:39.375
Your attack was foreseen.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.125
I allowed you to get this far
so I might gain

04:43.125 --> 04:45.875
the one great power I lack,

04:45.875 --> 04:49.583
a passport
to the dimension of time.

04:49.583 --> 04:54.166
You presume
to attempt to destroy me?

04:54.166 --> 04:58.875
Mutant, you shall pay
for your hubris.

04:58.875 --> 05:02.000
Right now!

05:05.333 --> 05:06.708
We have to get inside.

05:06.708 --> 05:08.583
Go on.

05:08.583 --> 05:11.625
Take your best shot.
You'll never win.

05:12.250 --> 05:16.250
Never win, insect?

05:16.250 --> 05:19.000
[laughing menacingly]

05:19.000 --> 05:21.125
Others will come after you.

05:21.125 --> 05:23.625
The world won't stomach
your evil forever.

05:23.625 --> 05:25.458
Evil?

05:25.458 --> 05:27.458
I am not malevolent.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.291
I simply am.

05:29.291 --> 05:33.125
Which soon will be
more than I can say for you.

05:40.500 --> 05:44.708
But then again,
I am given pause to wonder.

05:44.708 --> 05:47.291
Is it possible
you are correct, mutant?

05:47.291 --> 05:51.375
I have been battling your kind
for thousands of years.

05:51.375 --> 05:54.583
I ought to have triumphed
long ago.

05:54.583 --> 05:58.083
But what if,
like tortured Sisyphus,

05:58.083 --> 06:01.000
I cannot win. Ever?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.166
What a cruel joke.

06:04.166 --> 06:07.458
Am I doomed
to struggle with such filth

06:07.458 --> 06:10.083
until the end of time?

06:10.083 --> 06:14.416
Perhaps my newfound power
can show me the answer.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.416
I've got your answer,
right here!

06:20.708 --> 06:22.125
Apocalypse!

06:28.958 --> 06:30.000
[Tyler]
Father?

06:32.708 --> 06:33.708
Did you find him?

06:33.708 --> 06:35.083
Yeah.

06:35.083 --> 06:38.000
But he took off
with my computer.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.708
Now I can't time travel
and he can.

06:40.708 --> 06:43.875
What bothers me is that
he didn't finish me off.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.416
Like he didn't need to,

06:45.416 --> 06:48.000
like nothing I could do
to him mattered.

06:53.166 --> 06:54.416
Sorry, pal.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.708
Oh, you'll be fine

06:56.708 --> 06:58.208
in a day or two.

07:01.708 --> 07:05.375
[Bantam]
I hate this!

07:09.708 --> 07:11.333
[Bishop]
Wow.

07:11.333 --> 07:14.208
It's incredible how one kid
could mean so much

07:14.208 --> 07:15.583
to so many people.

07:19.875 --> 07:21.166
What now?

07:21.166 --> 07:22.708
With him alive,

07:22.708 --> 07:24.750
we ain't even supposed
to exist.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.250
I don't know!

07:26.708 --> 07:28.875
Why are we still here?

07:28.875 --> 07:31.208
As long as your armbands
are on you and functioning,

07:31.208 --> 07:33.500
you'll both exist
outside of time.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.083
-How long?
-Sorry.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.625
The charge only lasts
a couple of days.

07:40.125 --> 07:41.500
It was good, darling.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.125
[Shard]
Here he comes.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.500
Forge, what is it?

07:57.500 --> 07:59.375
I do not understand!

07:59.375 --> 08:01.625
The portal
is functioning properly.

08:01.625 --> 08:04.000
There is a massive impediment
in the time stream.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.583
Do something!

08:06.458 --> 08:07.625
Bishop!

08:09.625 --> 08:12.291
[screaming]

08:13.125 --> 08:16.291
[laughter menacingly]

08:23.625 --> 08:26.875
[screaming]

08:29.083 --> 08:30.000
[grunts]

08:30.000 --> 08:33.583
[panting]

08:33.583 --> 08:35.833
What is this place?

08:36.708 --> 08:39.250
[cackling]

08:40.583 --> 08:44.583
A visitor! Just in time
to catch me if you can!

08:44.583 --> 08:46.458
[Bishop]
Hey! Wait!

08:46.458 --> 08:50.416
So close yet so far.
So far, so good. So long!

08:51.750 --> 08:53.416
What the...

08:53.416 --> 08:54.458
I'm not half the man
I used to be.

08:56.833 --> 08:59.500
You can't catch me,
you can't catch me.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.416
I'm neither here nor there.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.875
I'm over here. No,
I'm not there. I'm over here.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.083
Stop it! Give me
some straight answers!

09:05.083 --> 09:08.750
Okay, okay, I'll spill!
Call me Bender, so few do.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.291
But that's because you're
the only other one here.

09:11.458 --> 09:14.000
That's crazy!
And where's here?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.333
The Axis of Time.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.708
No time like the present.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.583
Can't run away from your past.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.583
But your future's so bright,
I can hardly see you!

09:23.583 --> 09:26.625
Been here over 10,000 years,
give or take!

09:26.625 --> 09:28.958
[laughing]

09:28.958 --> 09:31.125
Oh, your molecules,
they get a little unstable
after a while.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.958
But how did I get here?

09:32.958 --> 09:34.583
Through the Axis, how else?

09:34.583 --> 09:36.583
All time travelers pass
through there.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.458
[chuckles mockingly]
Anyone knows that.

09:38.458 --> 09:40.750
Some big guy
threw you off course.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.083
If the Axis is the way
out of this dump,

09:43.083 --> 09:44.583
that's where I'm going.

09:45.583 --> 09:48.000
[Bender]
Oh, we're going on a trip!

09:48.000 --> 09:49.458
How exciting.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.583
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

09:50.583 --> 09:51.875
[laughing]

09:51.875 --> 09:54.333
This clown's wearing thin.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.583
[Bender] Pictures!
Someone's playing with time!

10:03.500 --> 10:04.458
The X-Men!

10:06.583 --> 10:07.708
Oh!

10:10.125 --> 10:12.333
You can't kill time, silly.

10:14.750 --> 10:17.000
Don't you like
those people?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.625
Anybody who can get me
out of here will be
my friend for life.

10:20.875 --> 10:23.375
Don't everybody volunteer
at once.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.000
[Beast]
"And the brass will crash

10:28.000 --> 10:29.833
"and the trumpets bray.

10:29.833 --> 10:31.625
And they'll cut a dash
on their wedding day"

10:32.875 --> 10:35.458
Professor, you have
outdone yourself.

10:35.458 --> 10:39.625
Well, Jean and Scott deserve
nothing but the very best.

10:39.625 --> 10:41.458
Ah! Here we go.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.875
[whispering] Weddings are
so totally cool!

10:49.875 --> 10:52.375
[whispering] That all depend
on your point of view, chere.

11:00.583 --> 11:03.708
A joyous day,
long in coming.

11:03.708 --> 11:06.583
"The joys of marriage
are the heaven on Earth,

11:06.583 --> 11:08.291
"Life's paradise,

11:08.291 --> 11:10.708
"the soul's quiet,
Sinews of concord,

11:10.708 --> 11:14.875
earthly immortality,"
John Ford, 1630.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.875
For my first two X-Men,
I pray it is so.

11:21.833 --> 11:23.583
[guests applauding
and laughing]

11:26.000 --> 11:27.125
[man]
That's it.

11:28.166 --> 11:31.583
If you don't make her happy,
don't let me find out.

11:40.875 --> 11:43.625
You came to me as children,

11:43.625 --> 11:46.125
now look at
the extraordinary people

11:46.125 --> 11:47.708
you have become.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.958
Thanks, but we still have
a lot to learn.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.708
I am not so sure. Perhaps.

11:54.416 --> 11:56.708
[women clamoring]

12:00.625 --> 12:03.166
Whole lot of good
it's gonna do me.

12:03.166 --> 12:05.083
Gambit fix their car good.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.333
[all cheering]

12:20.333 --> 12:23.000
After what happened the last
time they tried to get married,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.875
I am pleased that
this has gone so smoothly.

12:30.958 --> 12:34.000
-[both screaming]
-[tires squealing]

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Jean!

12:41.750 --> 12:45.500
As practical jokes go,
that seems a bit excessive.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.291
But Gambit just soap
the window!

12:47.291 --> 12:49.583
I shut the
defensive perimeter down

12:49.583 --> 12:51.875
-for the wedding.
-[all screaming]

12:51.875 --> 12:53.333
[Gambit]
It's Ruckus.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.416
[people screaming]

13:06.000 --> 13:08.750
[Storm grunts]
Can't fly!

13:13.833 --> 13:15.583
This party ain't over yet!

13:23.625 --> 13:26.166
The Nasty Boys
got Jean and Cyclops!

13:26.166 --> 13:27.875
That means, Sinister!

13:27.875 --> 13:30.833
That's no way to start
a honeymoon, huh, chere?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
[metallic creaking]

13:42.375 --> 13:45.833
Nice work, Slab.
The boss is gonna be psyched!

13:45.833 --> 13:48.708
Toss the woman in the portal
and let's blow this dive.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.875
[groaning]

14:02.208 --> 14:05.875
Jean Grey!
Scott Summers!

14:05.875 --> 14:10.000
The mighty X-Men,
ours to play with.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.416
[laughing]

14:17.000 --> 14:21.166
Leave him. This wedding day
belongs to the bride.

14:21.166 --> 14:24.166
Ruckus, Vertigo,
Hairbag, move it!

14:24.166 --> 14:25.208
We're travelin'.

14:32.833 --> 14:35.750
Storm, I can't sense
Jean anymore.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.458
That cannot be!

14:37.458 --> 14:39.291
We shall search
for her, Professor.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.333
Jubilee, get rid
of the guests.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.875
Uh, sure, I'll think
of something.

14:53.375 --> 14:54.625
[groaning]

14:54.625 --> 14:55.875
He don't look so good.

14:57.208 --> 14:59.000
Where is she?

14:59.458 --> 15:01.000
Cyclops will be all right.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.250
How'd the Nasty Boys
show up out of nowhere

15:06.250 --> 15:08.083
and then disappear?

15:08.083 --> 15:11.000
And it is curious that
they would take only Jean.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.500
[Wolverine sniffing]

15:12.500 --> 15:14.000
They were here all right.

15:14.708 --> 15:16.875
But I can't tell
which direction they went.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.875
They better hope
I never find them.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.875
[Beast] There's nothing more
we can do here.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.833
Perhaps this was simply a ruse

15:23.833 --> 15:25.625
to draw us away
from the mansion.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.000
Rogue, you and I
shall take Cyclops back

15:28.000 --> 15:29.416
and check headquarters.

15:29.416 --> 15:31.083
The rest of you,
see if you can find

15:31.083 --> 15:33.000
some trace of the Nasty Boys.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.125
If I can't smell 'em,
we ain't finding 'em.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.416
[beeping]

15:45.416 --> 15:47.416
The guests are all gone.

15:47.416 --> 15:50.125
I still cannot find Jean.

15:50.125 --> 15:54.500
There have been a few spikes
of unusual energy.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.250
[Mr. Sinister]
Like me?

15:58.208 --> 16:00.000
[Xavier]
Sinister!

16:00.000 --> 16:02.166
[Mr. Sinister]
I missed the wedding.

16:02.166 --> 16:03.291
I'm hurt.

16:03.291 --> 16:06.625
[screaming]

16:07.625 --> 16:09.000
Get away from him!

16:10.375 --> 16:13.166
Foolish girl, do you think
your puny powers

16:13.166 --> 16:15.208
can affect me?

16:16.083 --> 16:17.208
[screams]

16:21.625 --> 16:24.458
Xavier, don't let him
take you.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.208
You don't like the movie,
change the channel.

16:26.208 --> 16:27.500
[laughing]

16:27.500 --> 16:29.458
Why am I seeing these things?

16:29.458 --> 16:30.708
Is this happening now?

16:30.708 --> 16:31.625
-Beats me!
-[screams]

16:34.000 --> 16:36.458
[cackling]

16:36.458 --> 16:37.875
Someone to play with!

16:39.333 --> 16:41.625
Look, I've got no time
for games.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.208
Give me some
straight answers,

16:43.208 --> 16:44.375
and I'll take you
out of here with me.

16:44.375 --> 16:45.708
Out?

16:45.708 --> 16:47.333
[laughs]

16:47.333 --> 16:48.833
There is no way out!

16:51.708 --> 16:53.875
We'll see about that.

16:53.875 --> 16:56.000
[Forge]
I can find nothing wrong
with the time portal.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.083
Your brother should
have arrived safely.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.083
Then send me back
to find him.

17:00.083 --> 17:01.583
If something happened to Bishop

17:01.583 --> 17:03.416
while he was traveling
through time,

17:03.416 --> 17:05.583
then he could be anywhere,

17:05.583 --> 17:07.000
or in any time.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.125
The only trace indicators point

17:09.125 --> 17:11.208
to the north-eastern
United States,

17:11.208 --> 17:13.000
in the late 1990s.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.875
The X-Men.
That's a start.

17:15.875 --> 17:17.416
Send me there.

17:17.416 --> 17:19.333
Are you sure you want
to try this?

17:19.333 --> 17:22.750
If we lost Bishop,
we may very well lose you.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.708
Where's my portal?

17:32.333 --> 17:34.250
You're Mr. Sinister!

17:34.250 --> 17:36.625
Who dares defy me?

17:36.625 --> 17:39.000
A friend
of Charles Xavier's.

17:40.708 --> 17:43.458
Drop him! Easy.

17:43.458 --> 17:44.583
No chance.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.250
[Jubilee groaning]

17:54.416 --> 17:55.583
Easy, kid.

17:56.375 --> 17:59.375
Who... Who are you?

17:59.375 --> 18:03.208
Shard. Bishop's sister.
I'll explain more later.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.166
Right now, we must help
the Professor.

18:05.166 --> 18:08.291
[Gambit] Mmm. This more
my kind of time travel.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.291
[Jubilee] All right,
the cavalry's here.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.875
[sniffs]
I smell something Sinister!

18:14.875 --> 18:16.583
Come on, he's got
the Professor inside!

18:16.583 --> 18:18.000
[groaning]

18:20.291 --> 18:22.250
George, it is time.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.750
Say farewell
to your world, old man.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.083
[Cyclops]
Don't count on it, Sinister.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.750
George, I need you
and the others! Now!

18:39.458 --> 18:40.833
Setback, sir?

18:40.833 --> 18:42.000
Stop them!

18:42.000 --> 18:44.416
And get me out of here.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.583
How'd you get in here?

18:46.583 --> 18:47.958
Where's Jean?

18:49.083 --> 18:50.875
[Rogue]
Get her out of here.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.083
Cover your ears.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.833
Vertigo's powers attack
the equilibrium.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.583
[Gambit] So we turn
her music off.

18:59.583 --> 19:03.583
[bellowing]

19:08.083 --> 19:10.875
This boy better lay off
the ice-cream sandwiches.

19:10.875 --> 19:13.458
[Jubilee]
Hey, this isn't a date.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.291
Yeow!

19:18.583 --> 19:22.000
Somebody, open a portal.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.375
Xavier was your job,
Sinister, not ours.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.375
I'll see what I can do
about transportation.

19:28.708 --> 19:30.583
Traitors!

19:30.583 --> 19:32.583
[Beast] Despite his newfound
time travel abilities,

19:32.583 --> 19:34.583
I believe Mr. Sinister
is caught between

19:34.583 --> 19:36.833
the proverbial rock
and a hard place.

19:36.833 --> 19:40.000
Do we find out
where Jean is now

19:40.000 --> 19:41.458
or after?

19:41.458 --> 19:43.458
What have you done
with my wife?

19:44.125 --> 19:47.875
Mrs. Summers is just
another broken blossom

19:47.875 --> 19:50.708
floating through
the winds of time.

19:50.708 --> 19:52.416
What do you mean,
floating through time?

19:52.416 --> 19:54.166
[laughing cruelly]

19:54.166 --> 19:57.166
Follow to find her,
if you dare.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.125
[Rogue]
Oh, no, you don't!

19:59.125 --> 20:01.750
[Cyclops] I'll follow you
to the ends of the earth!

20:03.375 --> 20:07.166
They've taken Jean to
the one place you can't get to.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.083
Another time.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.083
But you can! Show me how!

20:13.333 --> 20:14.500
[Jean]
Where am I?

20:16.250 --> 20:18.083
Can anyone hear me?

20:19.625 --> 20:21.166
Am I still alive?

20:21.166 --> 20:22.333
[screams]

20:22.333 --> 20:23.708
I guess so.

20:23.708 --> 20:25.333
Looks like
I can expect company.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.583
Sinister, what is this place?

20:30.583 --> 20:32.458
Why have you kidnapped me?

20:32.458 --> 20:35.833
[Apocalypse]
Because I told him to!

20:35.833 --> 20:37.458
[footsteps thumping]

20:42.166 --> 20:44.500
[laughing menacingly]

20:46.083 --> 20:48.875
[theme music playing]
