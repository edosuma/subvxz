WHOO-HOO! BABY!

00:38.121 --> 00:39.498
12 IN A ROW!

00:39.581 --> 00:41.542
WOW, YOU MUST HAVE HAD
A GREAT BODY

00:41.625 --> 00:44.169
BEFORE IT WENT ALL
FUN-HOUSE MIRROR ON YOU.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.171
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW TERRIFIC YOU LOOK.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.256
THANKS.

00:47.339 --> 00:49.091
I'VE BEEN TAKING
TAE-JITSU CLASSES.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.676
YOU SHOULD COME
WITH ME SOMETIME.

00:50.759 --> 00:51.885
I'D LOVE TO.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.679
OH, THE BABY'S
KICKING. WANT TO FEEL?

00:53.762 --> 00:54.763
SURE.

00:54.847 --> 00:56.265
OW! OW!

00:56.348 --> 00:58.433
OH! YOU ARE
FREAKIN' DEAD, KID.

00:58.517 --> 00:59.518
PETER!

00:59.601 --> 01:01.562
Meg:
OH, I LOVE THIS TIME OF YEAR.

01:01.645 --> 01:02.813
ME, TOO.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.106
THE SUMMER TOURISTS
ARE GONE

01:04.189 --> 01:05.941
AND WE FINALLY HAVE THE TOWN
TO OURSELVES

01:06.024 --> 01:07.734
BEFORE THOSE IDIOTS
FROM NEW YORK SHOW UP

01:07.818 --> 01:08.944
TO WATCH THE
LEAVES CHANGE

01:09.027 --> 01:10.195
AND TAKE OVER
THE WHOLE PLACE.

01:12.906 --> 01:13.907
( gasps )

01:13.991 --> 01:17.202
( horns honking )

01:17.286 --> 01:19.204
LEAFERS!

01:19.288 --> 01:20.664
HOLY CRAP.
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

01:24.918 --> 01:27.254
-WHAT ABOUT THE BOAT?
-LEAVE IT!

01:27.379 --> 01:28.547
HURRY, PETER.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.090
THEY'RE ALMOST HERE.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.175
WE'RE TOO LATE.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.262
YO, MATTIE,
CHECK OUT THOSE COLORS--

01:35.345 --> 01:36.388
YELLOW LIKE A TAXI

01:36.471 --> 01:38.432
ORANGE LIKE THE BALL
AT THE KNICKS GAME

01:38.515 --> 01:41.059
AND RED LIKE THE SAUCE
ON MY MAMA MIA'S GOO-GOTS.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.227
YEAH, AND BROWN

01:42.311 --> 01:44.354
LIKE THE GUYS I DON'T
PICK UP IN MY CAB.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.439
BEE-UTIFUL.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.607
( all scream )

01:46.690 --> 01:47.983
Good evening.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.569
Tonight's top story:
Quahog is infested

01:50.652 --> 01:53.864
with loud hairy creatures
also know as New Yorkers.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.200
They migrate north every autumn
to see the foliage.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.618
I think I speak for all of us

01:57.701 --> 01:59.953
when I say that New York
and everyone from there

02:00.037 --> 02:01.872
can fornicate themselves
with an iron stick.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.791
( horns honking )

02:04.875 --> 02:06.710
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE
FOR CHURCH.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.754
MOVE IT! DAMN LEAFERS.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.214
CHRIS, QUIT IT.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.216
MOM, CHRIS PUT HIS FOOT
ON MY SIDE AGAIN.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.300
I CAN'T HELP IT.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.302
I HAVE THESE LONG
DANCER'S LEGS.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.512
MOVE IT!

02:16.595 --> 02:18.138
MEG, STOP YOUR WHINING.

02:18.222 --> 02:19.723
CHRIS, STAY ON
YOUR OWN SIDE.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.226
LOIS, FOR GOD SAKE, GET OFF YOUR
ASS AND DO SOME PARENTING.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.393
IF YOU KIDS DON'T
KNOCK IT OFF

02:23.477 --> 02:25.354
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
McDONALD'S AFTER CHURCH.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.438
-MOM!
-MOM!

02:26.522 --> 02:28.106
DON'T WORRY, WE'RE GOING.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.108
B-B-BUT...

02:30.192 --> 02:31.777
YOU DON'T GET
TO SUPER SIZE.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.903
OH...

02:33.028 --> 02:34.029
OKAY, YOU CAN SUPER SIZE

02:34.112 --> 02:35.113
BUT NO APPLE PIE.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.198
OH, COME ON.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.282
OKAY, YOU GET
AN APPLE PIE

02:37.366 --> 02:38.534
BUT YOU CAN'T
BLOW ON IT.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.370
PETER, DON'T CONTRADICT ME
IN FRONT OF THE KIDS.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.288
LOIS, BROTHERS AND SISTERS
FIGHTING

02:43.372 --> 02:46.416
IS AS NATURAL AS A WHITE MAN'S
DIALOGUE IN A SPIKE LEE MOVIE.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.502
WUSSUP? CAN I GET
TWO SLICES OF PEPPERONI?

02:48.585 --> 02:51.547
( snarling and growling )

02:55.801 --> 02:57.010
WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?

02:57.094 --> 02:58.095
DAMN NEW YORKERS.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.555
THEY TOOK ALL
THE GOOD SEATS.

02:59.638 --> 03:03.267
AREN'T YOU PRECIOUS?

03:03.350 --> 03:05.018
( hissing )
( screams )

03:05.102 --> 03:06.854
( laughing)

03:06.937 --> 03:08.146
SOME OF MY NOVELTY ITEMS

03:08.230 --> 03:09.940
WERE PROVIDED BY
JACK'S JOKE SHOP

03:10.023 --> 03:11.567
OF SOUTH ATTLEBORO,
MASSACHUSETTS.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.986
REMEMBER, IF IT AIN'T FUNNY,
IT AIN'T WORTH JACK.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.238
I'D LIKE TO WELCOME

03:16.321 --> 03:18.240
ALL OUR OUT-OF-TOWN
PARISHIONERS.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.075
MY COUSIN, FATHER SAPIENZA

03:20.158 --> 03:22.160
IS IN FROM NEW YORK
TO SEE THE LEAVES

03:22.244 --> 03:23.745
AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE HIM

03:23.829 --> 03:25.414
TO DO THE
OPENING PRAYER.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.915
YO, GOD IS GOOD, HUH?

03:26.999 --> 03:29.793
AND HE EXPECTS US TO BE GOOD,
AND IF YOU'RE NOT

03:29.877 --> 03:32.796
HE'S GOING TO COME DOWN AND BUST
YOUR FREAKIN' SKULL. AMEN.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.715
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

03:34.798 --> 03:36.675
YOUR GOD AIN'T
TOUGHER THAN ME.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.468
YOU CAN'T TALK TO THE FATHER
LIKE THAT

03:38.552 --> 03:39.928
YOU STUPID GAVONE.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.889
I OUGHT TO COME OVER THERE
AND BREAK YOUR FREAKIN' ARM.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.473
YOU WANT TO GO, TOUGH GUY?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.017
I'LL SNAP YOU IN HALF

03:45.100 --> 03:47.436
LIKE AN ALMOND BISCOTTI
FROM BELARO'S ON 51st STREET.

03:47.519 --> 03:48.687
BEST IN THE CITY.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.272
FELLAS, THIS IS GOD'S HOUSE

03:50.355 --> 03:52.566
AND THE PATRIOTS KICK OFF
IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES

03:52.649 --> 03:54.026
SO COULD WE MOVE THIS ALONG?

03:54.109 --> 03:55.110
PATRIOTS SUCK!

03:55.194 --> 03:56.195
( gasps ): BLASPHEMY!

03:56.278 --> 03:57.279
( screams )

03:57.362 --> 03:59.072
IT BURNS! AH, GEE!

03:59.156 --> 04:00.157
"HOLY WATER"?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.117
WHERE'S THAT ACID I ORDERED?

04:02.201 --> 04:03.994
HEY, GUIDO, WATCH THIS.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.662
( whistling and whirring)

04:05.746 --> 04:07.998
WHOA! I'VE GOT TO LAY OFF
THE COFFEE.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.291
HOT-CHA-CHA, CHA-CHA!

04:09.374 --> 04:11.210
THAT'S JACK'S, EXIT 14 OFF 295.

04:13.879 --> 04:17.132
TAE-JITSU IS ABOUT POWER
FOR YOUR BODY AND YOUR MIND.

04:17.216 --> 04:20.052
DON'T BE AFRAID TO FREE
THE BEAST INSIDE YOU.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.470
LEFT KICK! RIGHT KICK!

04:21.553 --> 04:23.096
PUNCH COMBO! STOMP!

04:23.180 --> 04:24.598
BEAUTIFUL! AGAIN!

04:24.681 --> 04:25.933
LEFT KICK!

04:26.016 --> 04:28.268
WOW, YOU'RE DOING GREAT
FOR YOUR FIRST LESSON.

04:28.352 --> 04:31.021
I'M REALLY CUTTING LOOSE
JUST LIKE JULIE ANDREWS

04:31.104 --> 04:33.190
IN THAT MOVIE WHERE
SHE SHOWED HER BREASTS.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.109
OH, MARY, YOU'LL NEVER
LEAVE US, WILL YOU?

04:36.193 --> 04:37.778
YES, THOSE ARE LOVELY

04:37.861 --> 04:40.447
BUT IT DOESN'T QUITE
ANSWER OUR QUESTION.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.913
JETS RULE!

04:47.996 --> 04:50.457
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.209
HEY, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
WILL YOU?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.336
HEY, HORACE,
PUT THE PATS GAME ON THE TV

04:54.419 --> 04:56.004
AND GET ME A FEW BEERS, HUH?

04:56.088 --> 04:58.799
SORRY, PETER, SOMEONE
STOLE THE REMOTES

04:58.882 --> 05:01.176
AND THE KEGS,
AND I'M NOT SURE

05:01.260 --> 05:03.387
BUT I THINK
I'VE BEEN SHOT.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.721
YEP.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.224
HEY, PAL,
WATCH MY SEAT.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.935
I GOT TO BLEED THE LIZARD.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.770
( unzipping and tinkling)

05:11.854 --> 05:13.772
PUBLIC URINATION IS JUST WRONG

05:13.856 --> 05:16.233
EXCEPT DURING
THE MILLION MAN MARCH

05:16.316 --> 05:18.986
WHEN PROTESTERS
BURNED OUR PORT-A-POTTIES.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.531
THEN I USED MY STREAM OF JUSTICE
TO PUT OUT THE HATE.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.866
I DON'T KNOW, FELLAS

05:23.949 --> 05:25.325
I THINK THERE'S POTENTIAL
IN THIS CROWD.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.451
( snickers )

05:26.535 --> 05:27.911
HEY, HONEY, WHY DON'T
YOU TURN AROUND

05:27.995 --> 05:29.496
AND SHOW ME THE
LOWER EAST SIDE?

05:29.580 --> 05:30.581
( deep voice ): SURE.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.790
WHOA! TRANSVESTITE!
BACK OFF!

05:31.874 --> 05:32.958
WAIT A SEC--
PRE-OP OR POST-OP?

05:33.041 --> 05:34.042
PRE-OP.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.752
WHOA! TRANSVESTITE!
BACK OFF!

05:35.836 --> 05:37.045
YOU'RE RIGHT,
THIS PLACE BLOWS.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.255
WE GOT TO SEND
THESE STRAP-HANGERS

05:38.338 --> 05:39.423
BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.592
DON'T WORRY,
I GOT AN IDEA

05:41.675 --> 05:44.970
AN IDEA SO SMART,
MY HEAD WOULD EXPLODE

05:45.053 --> 05:48.932
IF I EVEN BEGIN TO KNOW
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.562
( Peter yelling )

05:53.645 --> 05:55.898
I AM A MAN-EATING TREE.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.692
GO BACK TO NEW YORK
OR I WILL EAT YOU

05:58.775 --> 06:02.446
JUST LIKE I ATE INSANE
NEW YORK ANCHORMAN DAN RATHER.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.530
( spits )

06:03.614 --> 06:05.032
AND LOOK WHO I HAD
FOR DESSERT:

06:05.115 --> 06:07.743
ASEXUAL FORMER MAYOR
ED KOCH.

06:07.826 --> 06:08.952
( spits )

06:09.036 --> 06:10.162
LEAVE MY LAND

06:10.245 --> 06:12.039
OR I WILL SMITE YOU
WITH MY POWERFUL LIMB.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.373
WHAT? ARE YOU NUTS?

06:13.457 --> 06:14.541
GIVE ME THAT BRANCH.

06:14.625 --> 06:15.751
OH! GET OFF OF ME.

06:15.834 --> 06:16.835
( yelling )

06:16.919 --> 06:18.086
WHY, YOU...

06:18.170 --> 06:19.880
OH, MY GOD!

06:19.963 --> 06:21.507
STOP FIGHTING.
( yelling )

06:21.590 --> 06:23.342
( groaning )

06:23.425 --> 06:25.344
HOLY CRAP.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.012
OH, MY GOD.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.391
MOM, YOU COULD BE
A WORLD CHAMPION

06:31.475 --> 06:33.477
AND NO ONE COULD HIT
YOU BELOW THE BELT

06:33.560 --> 06:35.938
'CAUSE GIRLS DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING DOWN THERE.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.356
CAN YOU TEACH
ME TO KICK ASS?

06:37.439 --> 06:39.066
OH, NO, I DO NOT
CONDONE VIOLENCE

06:39.149 --> 06:41.193
AND I AM NOT
GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE

06:41.276 --> 06:43.612
FOR BRINGING FIST FIGHTING
INTO OUR SCHOOLS.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.490
GEE, LOIS, CAN YOU HEAR ME ALL
THE WAY BACK THERE IN THE '50s?

06:46.573 --> 06:47.950
OH, THAT WAS LAME.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.284
OH, POOR PETER.

06:49.368 --> 06:52.079
I EMASCULATED HIM
IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.914
I THINK
HE'S REALLY UPSET.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.834
Peter ( on bullhorn ):
GATHER 'ROUND, EVERYBODY.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.001
TEN BUCKS IS ALL IT TAKES.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.712
STEP RIGHT UP AND FIGHT MY WIFE.

07:00.796 --> 07:01.797
( gasps )

07:03.882 --> 07:06.176
COME ONE, COME ALL.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.511
SHE FLOATS LIKE A BUTTERFLY

07:07.594 --> 07:08.887
AND STINGS LIKE WHEN I PEE.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.557
PETER, I AM NOT A
SIDESHOW ATTRACTION

07:11.640 --> 07:13.058
AT LEAST NOT ANYMORE.

07:14.059 --> 07:17.437
ME LIKEY BOUNCEY!
ME LIKEY BOUNCEY!

07:17.646 --> 07:18.856
I WANT YOU
TO GET RID

07:18.939 --> 07:20.107
OF ALL OF
THIS RIGHT NOW

07:20.190 --> 07:22.568
'CAUSE I AM NEVER
FIGHTING AGAIN, EVER.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.736
COME ON, CHRIS, WE'LL HAVE TO
GO TO PLAN "B."

07:24.820 --> 07:27.406
( crowd murmuring )

07:27.656 --> 07:29.950
( growls )

07:30.033 --> 07:31.618
OH, NO!
AH! OH, GOD!

07:31.702 --> 07:33.078
OH, MY GOD! HELP ME!

07:33.161 --> 07:34.955
HELP ME, FOR GOD'S SAKES!

07:35.038 --> 07:36.623
HE'S GOING TO KILL ME!

07:36.707 --> 07:37.708
HELP!

07:37.791 --> 07:38.959
( gasps )

07:39.042 --> 07:40.377
DON'T WORRY, IT'S
A TRAINED BEAR.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.545
HE'S IN NO REAL DANGER.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.423
( grunts )

07:44.506 --> 07:46.175
OH, HE'S TEACHING A CLASS.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.885
I-I CAN'T BOTHER HIM NOW.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.011
SURE YOU CAN.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.221
HEY, HEY,
RALPH MACCHIO.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.431
MY WIFE HERE NEEDS
TO TALK TO YOU.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.515
THERE YOU GO, HONEY.

07:53.599 --> 07:54.600
WHAT IS IT, LOIS?

07:54.683 --> 07:55.851
I, UH...

07:55.934 --> 07:58.145
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD DO
TAE-JITSU ANYMORE.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.439
I'M AFRAID
I'M GOING TO HURT SOMEONE.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.441
BUT, LOIS, YOU'RE
MY STAR PUPIL.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.359
I WANT YOU IN MY
ADVANCED CLASS.

08:04.443 --> 08:05.444
ADVANCED CLASS?

08:05.527 --> 08:06.528
NO, NO, NO.

08:06.612 --> 08:07.613
I'M TRYING TO QUIT.

08:07.696 --> 08:08.864
WELL, FINE, QUIT

08:08.947 --> 08:10.699
BUT GET USED TO PEOPLE
WALKING ALL OVER YOU.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.326
W-W-W-WAIT.
HOLD ON THERE.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.245
NOBODY WALKS ALL OVER MY WIFE
'CAUSE I WON'T LET THEM.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.496
PETER...

08:16.580 --> 08:17.748
QUIET, LOIS, MEN ARE TALKING.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.208
SHE LEARNS THINGS EVENTUALLY.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.501
IT JUST TAKES HER LONGER.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.002
COME ON, HONEY,
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.712
IF YOU HURRY,
I'LL LET YOU TRY ON HATS.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.589
I WON'T LET YOU BUY,
BUT YOU CAN TRY THEM ON.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.673
I'LL DO IT.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.054
( grunting and growling )

08:36.850 --> 08:38.060
( yells )

08:39.353 --> 08:40.354
OW!

08:40.437 --> 08:42.272
( crying )

08:45.901 --> 08:47.694
STEWIE, YOU WANT TO SWING?

08:47.778 --> 08:48.779
YES, WHY NOT?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.364
I'LL HAVE A GO AT IT.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.491
PERHAPS A QUICK STRETCH FIRST.

08:52.574 --> 08:53.575
( cracking )

08:53.659 --> 08:55.285
OOH, DAMN.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.746
MUST HAVE PULLED SOMETHING
PLAYING HOOPS LAST WEEK.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.832
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT PUTTING
THAT ROCK UP FROM HERE.

09:00.916 --> 09:01.959
YOU AIN'T GOT NO J.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.589
YO, MAN, THAT'S TRIPPIN'.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.508
BROTHER, PLEASE,
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S TRIPPIN'.

09:09.591 --> 09:10.717
GO ON, CRY HOME TO YOUR MAMA.

09:10.801 --> 09:11.844
SHE WAITIN' FOR YA.

09:11.927 --> 09:12.928
NOW, DON'T MAKE ME

09:13.011 --> 09:14.888
PUT MY SIZE 13s
UP YOUR NARROW ASS!

09:14.972 --> 09:16.473
I DON'T SWEAT, YOU.
BRING IT ON, BITCH.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.599
NOW, HOW YOU GOING TO ACT?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.978
GEEZ, BRINGING THAT TRASH
IN HERE.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.312
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

09:22.396 --> 09:26.108
EXCUSE ME,
WE WERE ABOUT TO USE THAT.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.901
YOU SNOOZE,
YOU LOSE, LADY.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.528
YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.197
EITHER MY BABY SWINGS
FROM THIS JUNGLE GYM

09:32.281 --> 09:34.032
OR YOU DO.

09:34.283 --> 09:37.828
OOH, LOIS, SOMEONE'S WEARING
THEIR OVARIES ON THE OUTSIDE.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.413
SHE SAW ME WALKING
TO THE SWING.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.789
YES, YES,
SHE SAW YOU. EASY, NOW.

09:40.873 --> 09:42.332
NOBODY WALKS
ALL OVER ME.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.667
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.127
LOIS GRIFFIN
DEMANDS RESPECT.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.253
( Stewie screams )

09:46.336 --> 09:47.880
( grunts )

09:47.963 --> 09:49.214
( sniffs )

09:49.298 --> 09:51.091
OH, I SMELL
A MESSY DIAPER.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.843
GOD, WHY DOES
THAT TURN ME ON?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.390
HOLD IT, MEG,
THOSE TWO ARE MINE.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.600
WHAT?

09:59.683 --> 10:01.602
THAT'S RANDY
AND THAT'S FRED.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.478
RANDY IS THE MESSY ONE.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.771
FRED'S VERY NEAT.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.815
WHEN YOU GET
THEM TOGETHER--

10:06.899 --> 10:08.942
HOO-HOO!--
HOLD ON TO YOUR SIDES.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.945
NICE TO MEET YOU BOTH.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.322
( gasps )

10:13.405 --> 10:14.656
MURDERER!

10:14.907 --> 10:16.783
STOP IT!
BOTH OF YOU!

10:16.950 --> 10:18.202
STARTING NOW, YOU TWO

10:18.285 --> 10:19.786
ARE GOING TO LOVE
EACH OTHER.

10:19.870 --> 10:20.996
NOW, STAY THAT WAY.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.791
IT'S GOING TO BE WEIRD
TO POTTY.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.960
SHEESH, LOIS,
LOOK AT THE GARBAGE

10:27.044 --> 10:29.671
THOSE DAMN LEAFERS
DUMPED ON OUR LAWN.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.798
NEW YORK POST,
NEW YORK MAGAZINE

10:31.882 --> 10:33.133
THE NEW YORK METS.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.843
PETER, I'M SICK
AND TIRED

10:34.927 --> 10:37.012
OF HEARING YOU WHINE
ABOUT THE LEAFERS.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.096
TAKE SOME ACTION.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.181
FREE THE BEAST!

10:39.264 --> 10:42.309
( crowd gasps )

10:42.392 --> 10:43.894
( Lois grunting )

10:43.977 --> 10:45.562
THAT WAS STRANGELY AROUSING.

10:45.646 --> 10:46.939
OW!

10:47.022 --> 10:48.482
( grunting )

10:49.900 --> 10:50.901
HELLO, 911?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.236
IT'S QUAGMIRE.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.446
YEAH, YEAH,
IT'S IN A WINDOW THIS TIME.

10:54.530 --> 10:56.114
WOW, LOOK AT THEM RUN.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.699
WAIT A SECOND, BRIAN.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.493
THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA.

11:03.705 --> 11:04.873
THE DRUNKEN CLAM?

11:04.957 --> 11:07.334
WHY COULDN'T WE GO
SOMEPLACE FANCY

11:07.417 --> 11:09.044
LIKE THE OLIVE GARDEN?

11:09.127 --> 11:10.587
OH, THE BREADSTICKS.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.965
ME LIKEY BREADSTICKS,
ME LIKEY...

11:13.048 --> 11:15.050
YOU'RE A BIG GIRL
NOW. STOP IT.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.760
HOLD-HOLD-HOLD ON, LOIS.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.011
EXCUSE ME,
NEW YORKER.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.972
I THINK YOU'RE
IN MY SEAT AND I HAD SEX

11:20.055 --> 11:21.682
WITH YOUR MOTHER
LAST NIGHT.

11:21.765 --> 11:22.766
PETER, ARE YOU CRAZY?

11:22.850 --> 11:23.851
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

11:23.934 --> 11:25.269
ABOUT THE SEAT

11:25.352 --> 11:26.562
OR ABOUT MY PLOWING
YOUR FATHER'S WIFE?

11:26.645 --> 11:27.646
HEY, OOH!

11:27.729 --> 11:29.022
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

11:29.106 --> 11:31.275
EXCUSE ME, IS YOUR
REFRIGERATOR RUNNING?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.694
BECAUSE IF IT IS, IT
PROBABLY RUNS LIKE YOU--

11:33.777 --> 11:34.945
VERY HOMOSEXUALLY.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.196
WHAT?!

11:36.280 --> 11:37.573
HOW? YOU WANT TO DANCE?

11:38.782 --> 11:40.701
JETS SUCK, YANKEES
SUCK, KNICKS SUCK.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.456
KRYPTON SUCKS.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.958
All: HMM?

11:51.587 --> 11:56.425
( all screaming )

12:01.221 --> 12:04.224
THAT'S RIGHT, GO BACK WHERE
YOU CAME FROM, YOU BASTARDS.

12:10.814 --> 12:13.108
WE'LL CONCLUDE TODAY'S
GRADUATION CEREMONY

12:13.192 --> 12:15.110
WITH A DEMONSTRATION
BY THE BLACK BELTS.

12:15.194 --> 12:17.321
OKAY, PEOPLE, LET'S SHOW 'EM
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.822
KATHY, GET IN THERE WITH LOIS.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.241
UH... I CAN'T. I HAVE CRAMPS.

12:21.325 --> 12:23.911
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING ME
UP AGAINST THE SCRUBS, JARED?

12:23.994 --> 12:26.121
WHY DON'T YOU BE A MAN
AND FIGHT ME YOURSELF?

12:26.205 --> 12:28.624
WELL, LOIS, THE SENSEI
IS A SACRED POSITION.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.876
I COULD NEVER VIOLATE
THE SPIRITUAL BOND

12:30.959 --> 12:32.127
OF THE STUDENT-MASTER
RELATIONSHIP.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.087
OH, THEN ALLOW ME.

12:34.213 --> 12:35.422
All:
OOH.

12:35.506 --> 12:36.882
THE BOND IS BROKEN.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.635
THEN SPIN THE WHEEL,
RAGGEDY MAN.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.011
GO, LOIS! PUMMEL HIM

12:41.094 --> 12:43.722
WITH YOUR POWERFUL
FISTS OF FEMALE FURY!

12:43.805 --> 12:46.183
AND THEN, WHEN HE'S WEARY,
EMASCULATE HIM

12:46.266 --> 12:48.185
WITH YOUR INCESSANT NAGGING.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.854
HUH, WOMEN--
YAKETY-YAK, YAKETY-YAK-YAK.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.105
YOU KNOW, HUH?

12:52.189 --> 12:53.232
ENJOY THE FIGHT.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.581
EE-YAH!

13:09.665 --> 13:10.958
LOIS, THAT
WAS AMAZING.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.209
CONGRATULA...

13:12.292 --> 13:13.460
( smooches )

13:13.544 --> 13:14.711
THIS IS MINE.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.588
THIS IS WHERE
MY BABIES COME FROM.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.175
And now back to the movie
of the week...

13:23.512 --> 13:24.972
If this glacier
goes slower

13:25.055 --> 13:26.223
than one mile a year

13:26.306 --> 13:27.432
we're all dead!

13:27.516 --> 13:29.142
Tell me something
I don't know.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.352
Get out of the way!

13:33.689 --> 13:35.232
LOIS, I WAS
WATCHING THAT.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.986
WHATCHA... WHATCHA LOOKING AT?

13:39.069 --> 13:41.113
THE UNDERPANTS. LOSE 'EM.

13:41.196 --> 13:44.074
UH, ACTUALLY, I-I KINDA,
I SORTA HAVE A HEADACHE, KINDA.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.951
SEE, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE TOMORROW OR, UH...

13:46.034 --> 13:48.370
-TAKE 'EM OFF.
-YEAH, OH-OH-OKAY, HONEY.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.126
WHOA. WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

13:54.251 --> 13:55.752
THOSE ARE MY
GRAHAM CRACKERS.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.504
RUN ALONG, STEWIE.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.173
DADDY HAD A ROUGH NIGHT.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.008
WHY, YOU TOTTERING
FEN-SUCKED DEWBERRY.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.135
I'M GOING TO GO FIND
SOMETHING TO STRIKE YOU WITH.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.219
EXCUSE ME.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.307
GOOD MORNING.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.601
PETER, YOU
LOOK TERRIBLE. WHAT HAPPENED?

14:10.684 --> 14:14.104
LAST NIGHT, LOIS
WAS... THE MAN.

14:14.188 --> 14:15.522
GOOD LORD.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.149
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW, BRIAN--

14:17.232 --> 14:18.567
I DIDN'T CRY.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.860
( sobbing )

14:19.943 --> 14:21.612
IT'S OKAY,
IT'S OKAY.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.113
( sobbing )

14:24.698 --> 14:26.408
OH, NO. PETER!

14:26.491 --> 14:27.993
STEWIE, WHAT
DID YOU DO?

14:28.076 --> 14:29.453
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE FREED THE BEAST

14:29.578 --> 14:31.038
ALL OVER THE BACK
OF PETER'S HEAD.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.247
OH, MY GOD.

14:32.331 --> 14:33.790
THIS IS MY FAULT.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.835
THIS IS MY FAULT-- I BROUGHT VIOLENCE
INTO THIS HOUSE.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.129
I'M THE WORST MOTHER
IN THE WORLD.

14:39.213 --> 14:41.256
AHA! I GOT IT ALL ON TAPE.

14:41.340 --> 14:45.719
Stewie: Okay, um, this is me
interviewing Ed Sullivan.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.763
W-what's new, Ed?

14:47.846 --> 14:51.475
( imitating Ed Sullivan : Well, Stewie,
tonight we have a really big show.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.353
Stewie: Okay, okay, and now
a word from our sponsors.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.980
It takes a very steady hand.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.357
Don't touch the sides.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.276
( imitates buzzer )
Butterfingers.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.654
I-I WAS MAKING
RADIO SHOWS FOR FUN.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.781
E-EVERYBODY DOES IT.

15:05.864 --> 15:06.990
AT LEAST, E-EVERYBODY I KNOW.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.408
SHUT UP!

15:13.163 --> 15:15.499
NOW, STEWART, I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS MOMMY DOLL

15:15.582 --> 15:17.084
AND THIS DADDY DOLL

15:17.167 --> 15:18.710
AND SHOW ME
HOW THEY ACT TOGETHER.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.087
OH, YES, VERY WELL.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.673
ALL RIGHT, UM...

15:22.756 --> 15:25.259
YOU SEE, MARGARET,
AFTER 20-ODD YEARS OF MARRIAGE

15:25.342 --> 15:27.970
YOUR CURIOUS INDISCRETIONS
NO LONGER FAZE ME.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.847
( falsetto ):
REALLY? AND I SUPPOSE YOU THINK

15:29.930 --> 15:32.641
I ENJOY HANGING ONTO THOSE
HAMMOCKY DEPOSITS OF GIN SUGARS

15:32.724 --> 15:34.184
YOU CALL BUTTOCKS?

15:34.268 --> 15:35.894
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT DID YOU JUST WRITE THERE?

15:35.978 --> 15:37.187
GIVE ME THAT.

15:37.271 --> 15:40.566
"INSECURITY"?
"GENDER CONFUSION"?

15:40.649 --> 15:43.360
I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING
TO WRITE ABOUT.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.362
LOOK AT ME-- I'M INSANE.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.865
I'M MARTIN LAWRENCE ON A BENDER.

15:47.948 --> 15:51.034
( shrieking )

15:52.953 --> 15:54.705
MR. AND MRS. GRIFFIN

15:54.788 --> 15:56.623
DOES STEWART HAVE
A HISTORY OF AGGRESSION?

15:56.707 --> 15:58.292
NO, NO, HITTING PETER

15:58.375 --> 16:00.335
IS THE FIRST VIOLENT
THING HE'S EVER DONE.

16:00.419 --> 16:02.296
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
THE FIRST ACT OF VIOLENCE

16:02.379 --> 16:04.131
WAS THAT TIME BOMB I LEFT
TICKING IN YOUR UTERUS

16:04.214 --> 16:05.382
BEFORE I CAME OUT.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.759
HAPPY 50th BIRTHDAY, LOIS.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.344
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT YOUR SON

16:09.428 --> 16:11.054
IS LEARNING THIS BEHAVIOR
FROM SOMEONE.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.765
I, UH, I-I KNOW
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE

16:13.849 --> 16:14.850
FOR STEWIE'S BEHAVIOR

16:14.933 --> 16:16.101
BUT IF I TOLD YOU
WHO IT WAS

16:16.185 --> 16:17.477
LOIS WOULD BEAT
THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

16:17.561 --> 16:18.937
NOW, JUST A MINUTE.
( shrieks )

16:19.021 --> 16:20.314
THE WHOLE REASON
I STARTED FIGHTING

16:20.397 --> 16:21.398
IS BECAUSE OF YOU.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.649
I FELT WEAK.

16:22.733 --> 16:24.151
Y-Y-YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.986
YOU UNDERMINE ME
IN FRONT OF THE KIDS

16:26.069 --> 16:28.071
AND BESIDES, YOU'RE NOT...
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY

16:28.155 --> 16:30.032
FATHER OF THE YEAR
YOURSELF.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.826
WELL, THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT
OF ANGER IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD.

16:32.910 --> 16:35.537
YOU OWE IT TO YOUR SON TO LEARN
HOW TO MANAGE THESE FEELINGS.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.664
MANAGE WHAT?

16:39.499 --> 16:42.169
I KNOW I WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD
WITH MY TAE-JITSU

16:42.252 --> 16:44.129
BUT FROM NOW ON,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

16:44.213 --> 16:46.340
ANY MORE ANGER
IN THIS HOUSE, OKAY?

16:46.423 --> 16:48.133
THEN TELL CHRIS TO QUIT
DRAWING PICTURES OF ME

16:48.300 --> 16:49.384
WITH A PIG'S BODY.

16:49.468 --> 16:50.761
DON'T CENSOR ME!

16:50.844 --> 16:51.929
NO MORE ANGER!

16:52.012 --> 16:53.972
OKAY.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.307
THE PSYCHOLOGIST WANTS US

16:55.390 --> 16:58.769
TO TRY AN EXERCISE
CALLED ROLE REVERSAL

16:58.852 --> 17:02.606
WHERE WE PRETEND TO BE
THE PERSON WHO MAKES US ANGRY.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.316
I'LL GO FIRST.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.485
( imitating Peter ): DON'T LISTEN
TO YOUR MOTHER, KIDS.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.154
SHE'S WORTHLESS AND DUMB
AND IGNORE HER

17:09.238 --> 17:11.406
AND ONLY LISTEN TO ME,
PETER.

17:11.490 --> 17:14.243
I'M LOIS, I BRAKE
FOR YARD SALES

17:14.326 --> 17:16.411
BUT I DON'T LET PETER
BUY ANYTHING HE LIKES

17:16.495 --> 17:18.247
LIKE THAT NARRAGANSET
BEER SIGN

17:18.330 --> 17:20.415
WHERE THE HOT CHICK
HAS TWO MUGS FOR JUGS.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.417
IT WAS EIGHT
FREAKIN' DOLLARS

17:22.501 --> 17:24.044
AND WE HAVE A DOZEN
PLACES TO PUT IT!

17:24.127 --> 17:25.295
OOH, OOH, ME NEXT, ME NEXT.

17:25.379 --> 17:26.880
I'M THE DOG.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.675
I'M WELL-READ AND HAVE
A DIVERSE STOCK PORTFOLIO

17:29.758 --> 17:32.427
BUT I'M NOT ABOVE EATING GRASS
CLIPPINGS AND REGURGITATING THEM

17:32.511 --> 17:34.763
ON THE SMALL BRAIDED RUG
NEAR THE DOOR.

17:34.847 --> 17:36.598
I'M A POMPOUS LITTLE ANTI-CHRIST

17:36.682 --> 17:39.142
WHO WILL PROBABLY ABANDON
MY PLANS FOR WORLD DOMINATION

17:39.226 --> 17:41.687
WHEN I GROW UP AND FALL IN LOVE
WITH A ROUGH TRICK NAMED JIM.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.410
WHOA, WHOA, PETER,
CALM DOWN.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.787
I'M SICK OF LOIS' ANGER
MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES.

17:58.871 --> 18:00.455
THEY'RE NOT WORKING.

18:00.539 --> 18:02.124
WHAT ABOUT THE WRITING
ANGRY LETTERS

18:02.207 --> 18:03.625
AND NOT SENDING THEM
EXERCISE?

18:03.709 --> 18:05.419
OH, GEEZ, I WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO SEND THOSE?

18:05.502 --> 18:07.337
Meg: HEY, LOOK, I GOT
A LETTER FROM DAD.

18:07.504 --> 18:10.549
"DEAR MEG, FOR THE FIRST
FOUR YEARS OF YOUR LIFE

18:10.632 --> 18:11.925
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A HOUSE CAT."

18:12.009 --> 18:13.093
DAD!

18:13.218 --> 18:14.970
"DEAR STEWIE, GET OUT."

18:15.053 --> 18:16.263
OH, THAT'S NICE.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.223
MINE JUST SAYS "DEAR LOIS"

18:18.307 --> 18:19.850
AND AFTER THAT
IT LOOKS LIKE

18:19.933 --> 18:21.476
SOMEONE JUST SPIT
ON THE PAPER.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.061
YOU GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY TO ME?

18:23.145 --> 18:24.897
YEAH, "P.S..."

18:24.980 --> 18:27.191
( sustained snorting )

18:27.774 --> 18:29.359
OH, OH, HOLD ON A SEC.

18:29.484 --> 18:30.736
( hawking loudly )

18:30.819 --> 18:32.654
HOLD ON, HOLD ON, RELAX,
EVERYBODY RELAX.

18:32.738 --> 18:35.115
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I WAS HOPING
IT WOULDN'T COME TO THIS

18:35.282 --> 18:36.867
BUT WE NEED TO GET
OUR ANGER UNDER CONTROL

18:36.950 --> 18:38.410
BEFORE WE KILL EACH OTHER.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.370
NOW MY PSYCHIATRIST GAVE ME
THESE PILLS.

18:40.454 --> 18:41.663
THEY'RE MOOD ELEVATORS.

18:41.747 --> 18:44.208
I THINK THEY COULD HELP,
UH... EVEN US OUT.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.459
WE'RE NOT
TAKING PILLS.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.002
IT'S NOT NATURAL.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.338
NEITHER IS BLEACHING THE HAIR
ON YOUR UPPER LIP, MARTIN MULL.

18:49.421 --> 18:50.964
GIVE US THE PILLS.

18:53.467 --> 18:57.721
( chanting ): ♪♪ AH-OOM, BOP-BOP,
AH-OOM, BOP-BOP ♪♪

18:57.804 --> 19:01.642
♪♪ HEY, OH, MOTHER AFRICA! ♪

19:01.725 --> 19:04.144
♪♪ AH-OOM, BOP-BOP. ♪♪

19:04.228 --> 19:06.021
AH, THAT WAS FUN.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.397
WHAT COUNTRY
SHOULD WE DO NEXT?

19:07.481 --> 19:09.066
MONACO.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.943
OH, WAIT, THAT'S
A PRINCIPALITY.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.027
( laughing )

19:12.361 --> 19:13.779
YOU GUYS WANT TO HEAR

19:13.862 --> 19:15.197
SOMETHING REALLY FUNNY?

19:15.280 --> 19:17.950
THOSE PILLS I GAVE YOU
WERE PLACEBOS, SUGAR PILLS.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.911
( laughing )

19:21.078 --> 19:22.538
WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU TELLING ME

19:22.621 --> 19:25.332
I JUST SANG LADYSMITH
BLACK MAMBAZO FOR NOTHING?

19:25.415 --> 19:27.960
DID IT KILL YOU TO BE
MULTICULTURAL FOR A MINUTE?

19:28.043 --> 19:29.586
I-I-I DIED A LITTLE
INSIDE, YES.

19:29.670 --> 19:30.921
YOU HAPPY NOW?

19:31.004 --> 19:34.091
DON'T YOU USE THAT TONE
OF VOICE, YOU, YOU...

19:34.174 --> 19:35.759
WHAT WERE YOU GOING
TO SAY, FAT ASS?

19:35.843 --> 19:37.386
WIDE LOAD?
DOUGH BOY?

19:37.469 --> 19:39.263
COUNTRY VIRTUOSO ROY CLARK?

19:39.346 --> 19:41.223
HOW ABOUT
ALL OF THE ABOVE?

19:41.306 --> 19:42.307
HOW'S THIS FOR A NAME--

19:42.391 --> 19:43.976
MS. PONY EXPRESS IS IN.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.310
WHAT DO YOU GOT
FOR ME, JOE?

19:45.394 --> 19:46.979
OH, LET ME SEE HERE.
UH, IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.272
UH, YEAH, HERE WE ARE.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.024
A BIG BAG OF LIVER
SPOTS FOR LOIS.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.611
YOU... YOU JUST HIT ME.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.530
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.991
YOU CAN'T HIT ME.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.200
I'M A GIRL.

20:00.284 --> 20:01.410
SOMETIMES I WONDER.

20:03.745 --> 20:04.746
( gasps )

20:04.913 --> 20:06.540
KICKING, LOIS?

20:06.623 --> 20:08.292
HUH. HURTS, DOESN'T IT?

20:08.375 --> 20:09.751
YOU TELL ME.

20:09.835 --> 20:10.836
OW! OW! OW!

20:10.919 --> 20:11.920
OW! OH!

20:15.591 --> 20:17.092
GO, DAD!

20:17.176 --> 20:18.385
KICK HER ASS!

20:18.468 --> 20:20.637
SHUT UP, THIS IS
ALL DAD'S FAULT.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.306
I DON'T LIKE TO BE TOUCHED!

20:30.898 --> 20:32.065
( screaming )

20:35.068 --> 20:36.570
OW! OW!

20:41.909 --> 20:43.785
( screaming )

20:45.329 --> 20:47.789
OOH! OW! OW!

20:55.005 --> 20:56.131
( screaming )

21:04.056 --> 21:06.058
( laughing)

21:06.141 --> 21:09.186
( all laughing )

21:23.951 --> 21:26.537
MAN, I'M GLAD WE GOT
THAT OUT OF OUR SYSTEMS.

21:26.662 --> 21:28.121
I WONDER WHAT
CAME OVER US?

21:28.205 --> 21:30.249
MAYBE PEOPLE ARE JUST
NATURALLY VIOLENT.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.875
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.794
I THINK IT'S ALL
THE TV WE WATCH.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.254
THERE'S SO MUCH
VIOLENCE.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.422
YEAH, TV IS DANGEROUS.

21:37.506 --> 21:39.550
WHY THE HELL DOESN'T
THE GOVERNMENT STEP IN

21:39.633 --> 21:41.885
AND TELL US WHAT WE CAN
AND CAN'T WATCH?

21:41.969 --> 21:44.471
AND SHAME ON THE NETWORK THAT
PUTS THIS JUNK ON THE AIR.

21:44.555 --> 21:46.098
UH, PETER, PETER,
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T

21:46.181 --> 21:48.058
SAY ANYTHING BAD
ABOUT THE NETWORK.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.810
WHY, WHAT ARE THEY GOING
TO DO, CUT OUR BUDGET?

21:50.060 --> 21:51.562
I'M GOING TO GO
GET A BEER.
