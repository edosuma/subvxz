00:04.760 --> 00:11.599
ANNOUNCER:
<i>This is the story of two sisters:</i>
<i>Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:11.800 --> 00:16.079
<i>Jessica lives in a neighbourhood</i>
<i>known as rich.</i>

00:16.280 --> 00:17.953
<i>Jessica likes life.</i>

00:18.160 --> 00:21.039
<i>The only thing about life</i>
<i>she would change, if she could,</i>

00:21.240 --> 00:23.755
<i>is that she would</i>
<i>set it all to music.</i>

00:25.040 --> 00:28.829
<i>The Tates have more secrets</i>
<i>than they do money.</i>

00:31.440 --> 00:34.638
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>Mary Campbell's house.</i>

00:36.400 --> 00:37.959
<i>Mary, too, likes life.</i>

00:38.160 --> 00:42.040
<i>Unfortunately, life doesn't seem</i>
<i>to be too crazy about her.</i>

00:42.240 --> 00:46.951
<i>As you can see, the Campbells</i>
<i>don't have nearly as much money</i>
<i>as the Tates.</i>

00:47.720 --> 00:51.396
<i>They do, however,</i>
<i>have as many secrets.</i>

00:55.200 --> 00:57.237
<i>In last week's episode of</i> Soap,

00:57.440 --> 00:59.830
<i>Jessica admitted her affair</i>
<i>to Chester,</i>

01:00.040 --> 01:02.874
<i>but Chester wouldn't admit</i>
<i>his affairs to Jessica.</i>

01:03.080 --> 01:04.593
<i>So Jessica walked out on him.</i>

01:04.800 --> 01:08.077
<i>Corinne caught Peter nibbling</i>
<i>another woman's ear</i>

01:08.280 --> 01:11.717
<i>and told him if she ever caught him</i>
<i>fooling around, she would kill him.</i>

01:11.920 --> 01:15.357
<i>Jodie, who tried to kill himself</i>
<i>because Dennis left him,</i>

01:15.560 --> 01:17.119
<i>woke up alive.</i>

01:17.320 --> 01:18.320
<i>Confused?</i>

01:18.520 --> 01:22.594
<i>You won't be after</i>
<i>this week's episode of</i> Soap.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.916
<i>We begin this week's</i>
<i>episode of</i> Soap

01:26.120 --> 01:30.433
<i>the morning after Jessica</i>
<i>walked out on Chester.</i>

01:35.640 --> 01:37.359
Good morning, Benson.
Good morning.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.434
Looking for someone?

01:40.640 --> 01:43.917
Huh? Who in the world would
I be looking for, Benson?

01:44.120 --> 01:45.315
Mrs. Tate.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.960
Why would I be looking
for Mrs. Tate?

01:47.160 --> 01:48.958
Because she didn't
spend the night here.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.517
What are you talking about, Benson?
Of course she spent the night here.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.154
Oh, yeah? Then where is she?

01:55.280 --> 01:58.398
Uh, she went out early this morning.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.319
Mrs. Tate don't leave early
no morning.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.672
Mrs. Tate can't find her shoes
much before noon.

02:04.600 --> 02:09.231
It just so happens that this morning
she got up very early and went out.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.160
Good morning, Daddy.
Good morning, princess.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.556
Good morning, Benson.
Mm.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.630
I've gotta go, Daddy.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.600
Oh, tell mother I won't
be home this evening.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.912
I'm flying to Washington to cover
Congressman McCallam's
press conference.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.760
And then she's gonna
cover McCallam.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.193
[LAUGHING]

02:28.400 --> 02:30.835
Shut up, Benson.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.033
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.197
Oh, Benson, I've got to have a cup
of coffee this morning.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.400
[GASPS]

02:37.560 --> 02:38.994
What a night I had.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.831
You know, Chester, when people
get angry and storm off and say:

02:46.040 --> 02:50.398
"That's it. I've had it. I'm leaving,"
I wonder where it is they go.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.280
Thank you, Benson.

02:52.480 --> 02:53.880
Well, you see, I went to the beach

02:54.080 --> 02:56.436
because, you know,
I thought that would be
a nice, quiet place to think.

02:56.640 --> 03:01.840
But, Chester, it was freezing cold and
then this seagull kept attacking me.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.191
So, of course, I couldn't stay
on the beach

03:04.400 --> 03:07.950
and I went to an all-night movie,
but, I mean, I couldn't stay there
because of that man.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.992
So I just...

03:10.200 --> 03:11.395
What man?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.717
Oh, this man that sat next to me.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.151
Chester, I was the only one
in the entire movie

03:16.360 --> 03:17.760
and then this man came in

03:17.960 --> 03:20.475
and with all those empty seats,
where do you think he sat?

03:20.680 --> 03:22.558
Next to you.
Right.

03:22.760 --> 03:27.073
And even though the theatre
was terribly warm, the entire time
he kept on his, uh...

03:27.280 --> 03:30.159
Trench coat.
Right. Yes.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.034
And I mean, Chester,
if that wasn't bad enough,

03:33.240 --> 03:35.596
I couldn't even hear the movie
because of his...

03:35.800 --> 03:38.440
Heavy breathing?

03:38.640 --> 03:41.030
Right. Chester, do you know him?

03:45.240 --> 03:47.436
No.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.280
Well, by that time it was
6-something in the morning

03:50.480 --> 03:53.791
and the sun was coming up,
and, oh, Chester, it was wonderful.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.119
Well, Jessica, I'm glad that
you came to your senses
and decided to come home.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.233
Oh, I didn't come
to my senses, Chester.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.511
Well, I mean,
I did come to my senses,

04:03.720 --> 04:07.794
but I think I may have come
to different senses than
you would have liked.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.559
What are you talking about, Jessica?

04:09.760 --> 04:15.040
Well, you see, Chester,
I know what you've done,

04:15.240 --> 04:17.880
and I have decided to...

04:18.079 --> 04:20.435
Well, "forgive" wouldn't be
exactly the right word

04:20.640 --> 04:25.840
because I'm not gonna forgive you,
but to put it on the shelf for now.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.713
But, Chester,
if it ever happens again,

04:29.920 --> 04:32.799
I'm afraid I won't be able
to put it on the shelf.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.356
By then, the shelf will be full.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.674
Why are you standing there
grinning, Benson?

04:46.880 --> 04:52.717
I don't know what I love more,
her sticking it to you
or you getting stuck.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.637
[♪♪♪]

05:01.200 --> 05:03.431
Nice how we're both getting out
on the same day.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.597
This way, neither of us
gets left alone.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.234
Yeah.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.831
Hey, kiddo, you're leaving
the hospital, you're not entering.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.953
You got your moods confused here.
What's the matter?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.994
This may sound crazy,
but I kind of don't wanna leave.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.437
Of course you don't wanna leave,
because it's safe here.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.552
Barney, when I came in here,
I had a life.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.514
I knew who I was,
what I was gonna do, what I wanted.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.200
I had someone.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.470
Now I don't know.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.990
Listen, kiddo, we're not so different.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.157
I also have to go out there alone.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.159
But neither of us
knows what tomorrow is.

05:37.360 --> 05:41.957
And I'll tell you something, Jodie,
neither does anybody else.

05:42.920 --> 05:46.709
Nobody knows. Robert Redford
doesn't know what tomorrow is.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.790
They could decide tomorrow,
nobody with moles works.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.798
He's finished.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.592
But what we do know
is that when we're born,

05:57.800 --> 06:02.955
we're given just one thing: time.

06:03.520 --> 06:07.275
Of course, if you're a Rockefeller,
you also get property.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.994
But most of us just
get time, Jodie. Use it.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.271
Enjoy it. Me?

06:13.480 --> 06:15.551
I'm gonna learn French.
What?

06:15.760 --> 06:18.434
That's right. When I get out of here,
I'm gonna enrol.
I'm signing up right away.

06:18.640 --> 06:22.111
I'm gonna learn French.
And maybe I'll go someday to Paris.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.439
And if I die first, who knows,
maybe God is named Pierre.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.794
Hi.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.517
Hi. Ohh. Nurse Beautiful.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.280
Oh, watch yourself, sweetheart.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.233
In my street clothes, I'm a tiger here.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.909
Oh, I don't know what I'm
gonna do without you two.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.600
What? Come on.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.359
An old man and a homosexual?

06:43.560 --> 06:46.553
Whatever comes next
has gotta be better.

06:47.480 --> 06:51.110
All right, it's time for
my last bathroom attempt.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.597
I feel like Livingstone
setting out for Africa.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.599
I'm really gonna miss you.
Well, I'll kind of miss you too.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.359
You will?
Yeah.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.029
Why?
Hey, you're a nice person.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.799
I'll miss a nice person.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.429
Oh.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.510
Well, uh, maybe, uh, sometime we'll
have dinner together or something.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.871
Sure. When?
Oh, I don't know.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.080
Tonight?
Tonight?

07:15.280 --> 07:17.272
Wonderful, 8:00,
I'll give you my address.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.480
Wait a second.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.593
How about French food?
I know a terrific French restaurant.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.200
Listen, this is just dinner,
you understand?

07:23.400 --> 07:24.400
Sure. Dinner.

07:24.560 --> 07:25.960
I mean, we'll have a meal together.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.355
Right. No dancing.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.560
This is not like it's
a bona fide date or anything.

07:29.600 --> 07:30.829
Right.
It's a meal.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.040
Right. A meal.
Right.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.714
We will eat and we will talk.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.879
Right.
And then, we'll go to bed.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.358
Woo-ha.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.314
No "woo-ha," it's a meal.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.671
I mean, we'll just have a meal
together, that's all.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.793
Sure, it's just a meal. Come on,
Jodie, it's like me and French.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.151
You never know
when you might use it.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.277
So you got somebody
to pick you up?

08:02.480 --> 08:05.154
Yeah. My mother's downstairs.
Ah. Okay.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.033
Barney, I, uh...

08:08.240 --> 08:11.074
I hate to say goodbye to you.
Well, it doesn't thrill me, either.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.114
I mean, besides being
wise and caring...

08:14.320 --> 08:16.551
Please, Jodie...
No, no, no. You're gonna listen.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.717
I mean, you've talked plenty.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.231
Barney, you've made me
feel terrific.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.591
You're the first person
I've ever met

08:24.800 --> 08:28.350
who put aside what I was
and just simply liked me.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.952
Never in all my life have I ever
met anyone like you, Barney Gerber.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.275
Well, now I guess...

08:36.480 --> 08:38.756
Don't say it, I don't wanna
hear it. No goodbyes.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.510
Because, while I was
in the bathroom, I, uh...

08:42.720 --> 08:46.157
I wrote down my address
and my phone number.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.230
Well, what else was
I gonna do in there?

08:52.360 --> 08:56.070
Now, I want you to
go and write likewise.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.990
Listen, Jodie, I realise that people
often exchange these things.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.318
And then, months later,
they find the scrap of paper

09:03.520 --> 09:06.115
and they, uh... They put
their chewing gum in it.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.915
But that's not gonna
happen here. No, sir.

09:09.120 --> 09:13.080
Because I don't let somebody I like
get out of my life.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.317
And in the second place,

09:15.520 --> 09:19.480
having my dentures, it would be
very reckless for me to chew gum.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.675
Ah.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.078
Hey, you're a terrific guy, Jodie.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.511
Go. Be happy.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.719
Hey, you can, you know.

09:30.920 --> 09:34.311
Come on. It's up to you.
It's just a choice.

09:34.520 --> 09:38.560
Look, you'll find another guy.
Or you'll find a girl.

09:38.760 --> 09:43.039
Or you'll find no one.
It doesn't matter.

09:43.760 --> 09:46.434
You got you.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.909
And you also got
the sunshine, huh?

09:51.120 --> 09:53.157
And you got the flowers.

09:53.360 --> 09:58.389
You got music,
and once in a while,

09:58.800 --> 10:00.996
whenever you want,

10:02.200 --> 10:04.237
you got Barney Gerber.

Yeah, I'll see you, Jodie.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.397
[♪♪♪]

10:27.760 --> 10:30.992
Look at him. He's getting
ready for the next shift.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.432
Ava, Corinne's gonna be here
any second, so you gotta go.
Sorry, baby.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.109
Oh, please, I love it.
Hit and run. Very romantic.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.961
Next time, perhaps we could wait
until I put down my tennis racket?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.076
[KNOCKING]

10:41.280 --> 10:43.590
Oh, there she is. Goodbye.
What? Are you crazy?

10:43.800 --> 10:45.314
I can't leave here half-dressed.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.840
The whole club will know,

10:47.040 --> 10:50.033
and in two minutes, my husband will
take our joint savings and my Jaguar
and leave in a rocket.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.357
Okay, then. In the bathroom.
Please, but be quiet.

10:52.560 --> 10:56.156
No. I thought I would sing something
from <i>Carmen.</i>

11:00.040 --> 11:02.635
Corinne's mother. Uh...

11:02.840 --> 11:04.752
Corinne's not here.
Oh, good.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.758
I was hoping I'd find you alone.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.110
Uh, look, Jess...

11:08.320 --> 11:10.676
Please, Peter, I've got to
talk to you about Corinne.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.712
I mean, she won't answer
my telephone calls.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.957
She won't talk to me
and she won't see me.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.278
Is she all right?
Is my little girl happy?

11:18.480 --> 11:22.713
Oh, happy. Oh, is she happy.
She's so happy, Jess, and I'm happy.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.752
We're both happy.
We couldn't be happier.

11:24.960 --> 11:28.476
You know, she's changed my life.
I am now a one-woman man.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.672
Really?
Jessica, I love her.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.032
Oh, Peter, that's wonderful.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.118
Uh, Peter, I have to
ask you something.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.471

11:41.720 --> 11:43.632
No. Absolutely not. Sorry.

Why?
Well, it's a mess.

11:46.560 --> 11:49.678
Uh, the bathroom's a mess.
That doesn't matter, Peter.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.156
I had wine for lunch.
But you can't.

Well, I have to.
Well, then, uh...

Let me clean it up.
It will just take a second.

Let me guess, you have
a few minutes. Forget it.

No. Listen, do you think
you could do me a favour and,
uh, climb out the window?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.435
Climb out the window? I love it.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.871
There's only one thing that would
make me climb out the window,

12:18.080 --> 12:21.039
and that would be if the
French Riviera was on the other side.

your window climbing, kiddo.
