WEBVTT

00:02.279 --> 00:03.741
You wanted to see me?

00:03.814 --> 00:05.025
May I ask why

00:05.095 --> 00:08.061
you have not filed a single mission report

00:08.135 --> 00:10.557
since I assumed command of this base?

00:11.111 --> 00:13.250
'Cause I haven't given you any?

00:13.319 --> 00:15.228
As you know, one of the changes
I made around here

00:15.303 --> 00:18.686
is to require every team member
to file mission reports,

00:19.271 --> 00:21.988
as opposed to only team leaders
and science officers.

00:22.055 --> 00:24.062
Really. I didn't know that.

00:24.519 --> 00:26.591
I announced it my fourth day here,

00:26.663 --> 00:28.573
at an away-team orientation meeting

00:28.648 --> 00:30.819
detailing changes to mission protocol.

00:30.887 --> 00:32.229
Was I there?

00:32.584 --> 00:35.137
- Yes. It was mandatory.
- Because I don't remember...

00:35.208 --> 00:38.142
I saw you there.
It's kind of hard to miss you.

00:39.464 --> 00:41.537
Look, my point is

00:41.608 --> 00:45.252
I want you to file a report every mission.

00:46.184 --> 00:49.567
- I'm not good at writing.
- I figured you might say that.

00:49.992 --> 00:51.202
Use this.

00:51.816 --> 00:55.198
It's a digital voice recorder.
Speak into it, we'll plug it in,

00:55.272 --> 00:57.280
and your report will be
automatically transcribed

00:57.353 --> 00:59.327
and filed with the others.

00:59.720 --> 01:00.997
I'm not good at talking, either.

01:05.737 --> 01:08.454
McKAY: I'm sorry.
Too fast for you, buddy boy?

01:09.640 --> 01:12.935
Nursing home just called, Rodney.
They want their scooter back.

01:13.001 --> 01:16.165
Scooter? That is a tri-cell LiPo pack
under my hood, son.

01:17.897 --> 01:20.318
- Hey!
- Sorry. My bad.

01:23.977 --> 01:27.687
- Okay, I will trample you.
- Don't trip on your skirt.

01:29.737 --> 01:32.126
- You okay?
- I could have dropped him.

01:32.201 --> 01:34.306
Sorry, we didn't know anyone was around.
You sure you're all right?

01:34.377 --> 01:35.806
Come to think of it,
what are you doing down here?

01:35.881 --> 01:37.288
Trying to get Torren to sleep.

01:37.353 --> 01:39.426
I find that walking him
is the best way to calm him.

01:39.498 --> 01:41.091
He's colicky?

01:41.450 --> 01:43.457
Dr. Keller says it's a phase that will pass.

01:43.530 --> 01:44.937
Don't worry about it.
I was a colicky baby, too.

01:45.002 --> 01:46.791
Just do what my mom did,
which was let me cry myself to sleep.

01:46.858 --> 01:48.232
I'm no worse for it.

01:49.706 --> 01:51.943
Anyway. We usually take turns
walking him,

01:52.010 --> 01:54.945
but Kanaan is away visiting
our people for a few days.

01:55.017 --> 01:58.880
I'd help you out, but it looks
like you got everything taken care of.

01:58.954 --> 02:01.442
Yes. Now all I have to do
is get him back to my quarters

02:01.514 --> 02:05.443
without waking him or being run over.

02:06.314 --> 02:07.459
Yeah, I mean, we're done here.

02:07.530 --> 02:10.247
We're just, you know, finishing up,
really, so...

02:10.315 --> 02:12.202
- Night.
- Night. Good one.

02:13.674 --> 02:15.616
McKAY: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.771 --> 02:40.138
I must have put too much strain
on the motor.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.145
Shaft needs a bushing lube.

02:42.956 --> 02:43.904
What?

02:46.315 --> 02:48.737
- What's that about?
- Beats me.

02:49.164 --> 02:50.276
Radek?

02:50.955 --> 02:52.133
Come in.

02:52.812 --> 02:55.398
Control Room, it's Dr. McKay.
We just lost power in the east pier.

02:55.468 --> 02:56.994
What's going on?

03:09.004 --> 03:10.465
McKAY: That's strange.

03:10.540 --> 03:12.482
Lights are out all over the city,
except the Control Room.

03:12.812 --> 03:14.241
Why is that?

03:14.316 --> 03:16.356
This is Dr. Rodney McKay
calling anyone in the Control Room.

03:16.428 --> 03:17.890
Please respond.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.537
Something's definitely not right.

04:38.415 --> 04:40.204
Rodney, are you there?

04:42.255 --> 04:43.815
Colonel Sheppard?

04:56.239 --> 04:58.574
Everything's dead. There's no way
of knowing what the hell's going on.

04:58.639 --> 04:59.948
All right. Hey, Rivers.

05:00.015 --> 05:03.081
Fan out, find as many Marines as you can,
work your way up to the central tower.

05:03.151 --> 05:04.809
If you run into Woolsey, let me know.

05:04.879 --> 05:06.603
Communications are down.
We're on walkies.

05:06.671 --> 05:08.646
- Radek!
- Rodney, what's going on?

05:08.720 --> 05:09.702
What, you don't know, either?

05:09.776 --> 05:11.750
I'm on my way to the control tower.
I tried to radio you.

05:11.823 --> 05:13.612
Power's out, except for
the central tower. Here.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.109
Look, I need you to go to
the main power room instead.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.493
See if you can reboot the system
from there.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.600
- Okay. All right.
- All right.

05:22.672 --> 05:23.785
Hello?

05:43.120 --> 05:44.909
<i>Rodney, do you read me?</i>

05:44.976 --> 05:46.253
Yeah, Radek. Go ahead.

05:46.321 --> 05:49.288
I've tried to restart power.
So far, absolutely no success.

05:49.361 --> 05:50.506
What about the ZPM?

05:50.576 --> 05:53.424
<i>I've checked it,
as well as the naquadah generator.</i>

05:53.489 --> 05:55.180
<i>Neither are online.</i>

05:55.249 --> 05:57.289
<i>Someone must have disabled them
from the Control Room.</i>

05:57.361 --> 05:59.979
If that was the case, then they wouldn't
have any power up there, either.

06:00.049 --> 06:02.864
Not unless they're using
an external power source.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.296
Okay, listen to me.
I want you to do exactly the same thing.

06:05.361 --> 06:08.623
Initiate a temporary patch
using an external power source.

06:08.689 --> 06:09.900
One of the auxiliary battery units.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.687
Yes, but that won't be enough to power
the entire city, not by a long shot.

06:12.754 --> 06:15.471
Don't worry about that. Just get me
enough juice to access the mainframe.

06:15.537 --> 06:17.260
We can figure out
what the hell's going on up there.

06:17.329 --> 06:19.337
All right. Whereabouts are you right now?

06:19.410 --> 06:21.646
- Level 36.
- Thirty-five.

06:21.713 --> 06:23.339
Great, 35. Perfect.

06:23.410 --> 06:26.574
So just another 28 floors to go,
and that's just this stairwell.

06:26.642 --> 06:30.472
Then we get to level 63,
got to cross over to an ancillary stairwell,

06:30.545 --> 06:33.360
climb another four levels,
that's just to access the Gate Room.

06:33.425 --> 06:35.564
You know, see if
you can route some of that power

06:35.634 --> 06:36.878
to the transporters while you're at it.

06:36.946 --> 06:38.091
All right, I'll try.

06:57.011 --> 06:58.026
Hey.

06:59.250 --> 07:02.316
This door leads to the
Gate Room stairwell, right?

07:02.482 --> 07:03.530
Yeah.

07:04.627 --> 07:07.758
Well, maybe the door was already closed
when we lost power.

07:07.827 --> 07:09.802
Or was sealed on purpose
to keep people out.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.402
What, you think
someone's infiltrated Atlantis?

07:11.475 --> 07:12.620
<i>Rodney?</i>

07:14.163 --> 07:15.308
Talk to me.

07:15.379 --> 07:19.536
I've initiated a temporary patch. I was
able to route partial power to your lab.

07:19.604 --> 07:20.913
Well, what about the transporters?

07:20.979 --> 07:22.223
<i>Still working on it.</i>

07:22.291 --> 07:24.625
Yeah, well, let me know
when you've got one online.

07:24.692 --> 07:27.026
Go to your lab
and try to tap into the mainframe.

07:27.091 --> 07:30.091
I'll try the other stairwells. They're
probably blocked, too, but who knows?

07:30.164 --> 07:32.269
Maybe there's another way up.

07:32.532 --> 07:33.808
All right.

07:36.083 --> 07:37.676
- Colonel.
That one's sealed, too?

07:37.747 --> 07:38.958
Yeah, all the stairwell doors are.

07:39.028 --> 07:41.297
Been trying to find a way up to
the Gate Room since the power went out.

07:41.364 --> 07:43.503
- Yeah, so have we.
- Any idea what's going on yet?

07:43.572 --> 07:45.099
No, McKay's still working on it.

07:45.171 --> 07:46.732
I guess we could blow the door with C-4.

07:46.804 --> 07:48.691
Yeah, we probably will,
but we're not there yet.

07:48.756 --> 07:51.855
I need to know what we're up against
before we go storming up there.

07:58.068 --> 07:59.759
- Any luck?
- Not much.

08:00.308 --> 08:02.131
You're right, though.
Someone's taken over Atlantis.

08:02.197 --> 08:03.145
They hacked into the mainframe.

08:03.220 --> 08:05.391
I'm having a hard time accessing
several of the critical systems,

08:05.461 --> 08:07.500
and the ones
that I can access are read-only.

08:07.572 --> 08:09.939
Hey, what're you...
How did you get up here so fast?

08:10.005 --> 08:12.907
I was able to get some of
the transporters back online again.

08:12.981 --> 08:14.475
What about the transporter
on the Gate Room level?

08:14.549 --> 08:17.266
No, sadly, no. There's a lockout code
in place on that one.

08:18.869 --> 08:20.014
Surveillance cameras.

08:20.085 --> 08:22.257
We've got closed-circuit feeds
on the Control Room and the Gate Room.

08:22.325 --> 08:24.113
Well, that is,
if you're not locked out of those, as well.

08:24.181 --> 08:28.043
They're not critical systems.
I should be able to access them if...

08:29.589 --> 08:30.734
Got it.

08:32.116 --> 08:33.644
A Puddle Jumper?

08:37.046 --> 08:38.125
Who is that?

08:38.197 --> 08:40.717
It's definitely not Atlantis personnel.

08:41.813 --> 08:45.196
- Can you get a feed on Woolsey's office?
- Yeah, hang on.

08:48.150 --> 08:49.459
Oh, my God.

09:00.854 --> 09:02.415
- Is that...
- Yeah.

09:07.479 --> 09:08.656
Michael.

09:09.239 --> 09:10.646
Hello, Teyla.

09:12.246 --> 09:13.970
How did you get here?

09:15.030 --> 09:17.452
The ship I borrowed from your people.

09:17.687 --> 09:21.429
It has provided me with
a wealth of information and technology

09:21.527 --> 09:24.048
and the key to infiltrating this base.

09:24.343 --> 09:25.553
Use this.

09:26.007 --> 09:29.487
It's a digital voice recorder.
Speak into it, we'll plug it in,

09:29.559 --> 09:31.283
and your report will be
automatically transcribed

09:31.351 --> 09:32.845
and filed with the others.

09:32.919 --> 09:35.123
I'm not good at talking, either.

09:36.791 --> 09:38.896
<i>Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

09:44.023 --> 09:46.260
- Is the shield raised?
- Yes, sir.

09:47.032 --> 09:48.690
Major Nelson's IDC.

09:49.687 --> 09:52.404
They're early.
Not due back until tomorrow.

09:53.975 --> 09:55.798
All right, let them in.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.570
It's not going up to the Jumper Bay.
What's wrong?

10:08.024 --> 10:10.260
Major Nelson, what's your status?

10:15.320 --> 10:16.727
What is that?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.410
Get everybody out of here.

10:20.504 --> 10:22.031
Get them out now!

10:53.497 --> 10:55.472
Closing all immediate access doors.

11:04.313 --> 11:07.281
- I've activated the portal's shield.
- Good.

11:07.354 --> 11:11.031
- What about the external power interface?
- We're connected.

11:11.098 --> 11:15.026
The Control Room level is now
drawing power directly from the ship.

11:15.098 --> 11:17.171
- Is the stun field holding?
- Yes.

11:17.242 --> 11:19.347
Two levels above
and below us are protected.

11:19.418 --> 11:21.240
Now we can get to work.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.021
Get to work on what?

11:24.859 --> 11:26.168
Forgive me.

11:26.970 --> 11:29.010
I forgot to congratulate you.

11:31.642 --> 11:33.169
What's his name?

11:37.371 --> 11:38.647
No matter.

11:39.995 --> 11:42.416
We don't have much time, I'm afraid.

11:42.747 --> 11:46.130
My hybrids are preparing
to activate Atlantis' self-destruct device.

11:46.203 --> 11:49.050
As soon as they do that, we will leave.

11:49.787 --> 11:53.616
- You're going to destroy Atlantis?
- A punishment richly deserved.

11:54.331 --> 11:57.713
Not that I expect you to agree with me,
but don't worry.

11:58.523 --> 12:00.345
Your baby will be safe.

12:00.475 --> 12:02.101
You are not taking my son.

12:02.267 --> 12:04.820
Yes, Teyla. I am.

12:06.363 --> 12:09.080
You know how important
your child is to me.

12:09.755 --> 12:12.538
His father and you have given him
a powerful gift that I will utilize

12:12.604 --> 12:15.735
to exert greater control
over my legion of hybrids.

12:16.988 --> 12:22.105
He is the key to increasing my strength,
securing my reign over the galaxy.

12:22.619 --> 12:25.881
Your reign is over.
You will not make it out of here alive.

12:25.948 --> 12:28.436
- My people will make certain...
- Enough! Enough.

12:29.532 --> 12:31.256
You think you've weakened me?

12:31.900 --> 12:35.545
You've destroyed my facilities,
ruined much of my research,

12:35.612 --> 12:39.835
but you cannot...
You cannot weaken my resolve.

12:40.828 --> 12:45.531
Make no mistake, Teyla.
I am as strong now as I have ever been.

12:48.604 --> 12:51.736
Look around you.
I am in control of Atlantis.

12:53.533 --> 12:57.111
The very place where your people
ended my life as I knew it.

12:57.373 --> 12:59.577
It's only fitting that I return

13:00.413 --> 13:03.959
to extinguish this blight
from the galaxy once and for all.

13:07.517 --> 13:10.267
- I thought Michael was dead.
- As did I.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.707
I mean, we blew up his ship, right?

13:11.774 --> 13:14.556
He's the one who stole our Jumper,
used it to escape from his cruiser

13:14.621 --> 13:17.141
before we could destroy it.
He's like a cockroach.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.580
Every time you try to step on him,
he just skitters away.

13:19.646 --> 13:21.555
All right, we need to get moving.

13:21.630 --> 13:24.663
Lorne, you and your team
take this stairwell.

13:24.733 --> 13:27.003
My team will take this stairwell.
We move into position.

13:27.070 --> 13:30.168
You wait for my mark to blast the door.
We head up, retake the Gate Room.

13:30.238 --> 13:32.856
McKay, you're with me. Zelenka,
stay here, try to figure this thing out.

13:32.926 --> 13:35.347
- Certainly.
- All right, we're giving Michael no quarter.

13:35.422 --> 13:37.757
If you get a shot at him, take it.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.122
Make sure he's dead. Let's move.

13:54.494 --> 13:55.836
Oh, man.

14:12.159 --> 14:13.948
I must speak with you.

14:19.071 --> 14:22.519
We are still having difficulty
with the self-destruct device.

14:22.591 --> 14:23.573
Why?

14:23.647 --> 14:27.062
As I told you, the encryption is much more
complex than we had anticipated.

14:27.135 --> 14:29.590
We have run several
integer factorization algorithms.

14:29.663 --> 14:31.518
Nothing has worked so far.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.526
- Keep at it.
- For how long?

14:36.288 --> 14:37.498
As long as it takes.

14:37.983 --> 14:39.161
It is only a matter of time

14:39.232 --> 14:41.305
before the others figure out
a way through our defenses.

14:41.375 --> 14:44.539
I know, but you will have solved
the encryption problem before then.

14:46.624 --> 14:49.885
We have the baby.
We don't have to remain here.

14:49.952 --> 14:53.019
We are not leaving
until that device is armed.

15:01.473 --> 15:04.288
- Problems?
- Nothing that can't be dealt with.

15:05.249 --> 15:07.616
You do know that Colonel Sheppard
is no doubt preparing strike teams

15:07.681 --> 15:08.696
to retake the Gate Room.

15:08.768 --> 15:12.117
Of course, probably moving them
into place as we speak.

15:13.249 --> 15:17.024
But don't worry.
They're not getting in here.

15:29.314 --> 15:31.256
Major, what's your status?

15:32.257 --> 15:35.072
C-4 is in place, Colonel.
Ready when you are.

15:36.994 --> 15:38.336
Fire in the hole.

15:38.402 --> 15:42.558
<i>On my mark. Three, two, one.</i>

15:42.817 --> 15:43.865
Mark.

15:47.074 --> 15:48.121
Move!

15:58.562 --> 16:01.115
Whoa, whoa, we're picking up
a serious energy reading up ahead.

16:01.186 --> 16:02.168
What is it?

16:02.242 --> 16:05.057
I don't know, but we should stop until I do.

16:06.755 --> 16:07.965
Major Lorne, hold up.

16:13.698 --> 16:16.186
Colonel Sheppard, Major Lorne is down.

16:18.146 --> 16:19.673
- What happened?
- I don't know.

16:19.746 --> 16:23.772
I think he hit some kind of force field.
He's alive but unconscious.

16:23.842 --> 16:26.079
Get him out of there and fall back.

16:26.147 --> 16:28.057
Looks like he's got himself a force field.

16:28.131 --> 16:30.303
He's nothing if not annoyingly industrious.

16:30.371 --> 16:32.411
- All right, what do we do?
- Well, we disable it.

16:32.483 --> 16:35.647
- How?
- We... We... Good question.

16:40.004 --> 16:41.946
I've been examining
the energy reading we picked up,

16:42.020 --> 16:45.369
and it appears that Michael
has somehow managed to modify

16:45.443 --> 16:47.266
the Wraith stun pulse technology
and integrate it

16:47.332 --> 16:48.925
with the Puddle Jumper
cloaking mechanism...

16:48.996 --> 16:50.905
Creating a kind of a stun bubble.

16:50.979 --> 16:54.078
No, a force field around the Control Room
and the Gate Room.

16:54.148 --> 16:55.970
Look, while it's in place,
we're not getting in there.

16:56.035 --> 16:57.148
Well, I know that.

16:57.220 --> 16:59.042
What you haven't told me
is how we're gonna turn it off.

16:59.107 --> 17:00.634
McKAY: That's because we haven't figured
that part out yet.

17:00.708 --> 17:01.723
Look, it's going to be very tricky.

17:01.796 --> 17:03.290
Yeah, you see,
Michael is using the Puddle Jumper

17:03.364 --> 17:04.411
as an external power source,

17:04.483 --> 17:05.858
not only for the Control Room
and the Gate Room,

17:05.924 --> 17:08.030
but also, he's using it
to power the stun bubble...

17:08.099 --> 17:09.278
Okay, enough with the "stun bubble. "

17:09.348 --> 17:11.683
- That's an accurate description...
- No, it's a stupid description...

17:11.748 --> 17:12.893
- It's a stun bubble...
- Guys, guys!

17:12.964 --> 17:16.313
Look, the point is that
if we want to disable the stun...

17:16.387 --> 17:17.336
The force field

17:17.412 --> 17:19.354
then we first need to disable
the power from the Puddle Jumper.

17:19.428 --> 17:20.672
Either that
or we figure out a way to override

17:20.740 --> 17:22.496
the mainframe lockouts
that Michael has in place.

17:22.564 --> 17:23.840
All right, how's that going?

17:23.909 --> 17:25.567
- It's not.
- Not yet.

17:26.340 --> 17:28.927
Keep working on it.
I'm going to check on Lorne.

17:38.789 --> 17:39.803
Hey.

17:42.245 --> 17:45.213
- What happened?
- That Puddle Jumper that came through,

17:45.285 --> 17:48.766
it sent out some kind of stun wave,
knocked everybody out.

17:49.573 --> 17:52.257
- All of Atlantis?
- I don't know. Probably.

17:58.406 --> 18:00.740
Don't worry, they'll wake up soon.

18:00.934 --> 18:02.974
Everyone has a different
level of resistance.

18:03.046 --> 18:05.118
- Here.
- Who would do this?

18:05.413 --> 18:06.875
I don't know.
That's what I want to find out.

18:06.950 --> 18:09.819
- Can you open that door?
- I think so.

18:09.894 --> 18:11.236
Good. Do it.

18:23.431 --> 18:24.860
Still nothing.

18:34.599 --> 18:38.243
There was a time
you understood me, Teyla.

18:39.270 --> 18:40.645
When your people brought me here,

18:40.711 --> 18:43.842
gave me the retrovirus
that turned me into a human,

18:44.135 --> 18:46.339
you alone showed me compassion.

18:47.590 --> 18:49.892
You were the voice of conscience.

18:53.895 --> 18:56.863
I've given this
a great deal of thought. I've...

18:58.663 --> 19:00.899
I'm willing to return the favor.

19:02.503 --> 19:05.438
I would very much like
for you to come with me.

19:07.432 --> 19:11.261
You can care for your child,
and I will care for the both of you.

19:12.424 --> 19:14.082
I would rather die.

19:16.776 --> 19:18.118
I promise...

19:20.648 --> 19:23.812
I will not harm either of you. Teyla...

19:27.336 --> 19:30.533
- You have to believe me.
- I cannot trust the word of a murderer.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.640
Why can't you understand?

19:34.536 --> 19:37.536
I have become what I am out of necessity.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.807
The need to survive!

19:39.881 --> 19:41.736
You became what you are
out of vengeance.

19:41.801 --> 19:43.557
Do you not punish criminals in your world?

19:43.625 --> 19:46.756
- Are they not brought to justice?
- Is this justice to you?

19:46.824 --> 19:49.988
Killing hundreds of thousands
of innocent people across this galaxy?

19:50.056 --> 19:51.202
They would not be dead

19:51.273 --> 19:54.022
had you not made me the subject
of your vicious experiment!

19:54.088 --> 19:56.194
Their blood is on your hands!

20:03.241 --> 20:04.189
It's your choice.

20:04.265 --> 20:06.785
You can come with me and live
or remain here and die.

20:06.857 --> 20:09.159
Either way, I'm taking your child.

20:17.545 --> 20:19.684
We need to blow up the Jumper.

20:20.810 --> 20:24.193
If we blow it up, we cut the power
and disable the force field, right?

20:24.265 --> 20:26.153
Yeah. It's a great plan.
I'm just not sure I'm entirely clear

20:26.218 --> 20:28.007
on how you intend on doing
the actual blowing up.

20:28.074 --> 20:29.896
- Fire a drone at it.
- We can't.

20:29.961 --> 20:31.903
The Chair Room requires far more power

20:31.978 --> 20:33.385
than the auxiliary battery units
can provide.

20:33.450 --> 20:35.621
I was barely able to bring
enough power into this lab,

20:35.690 --> 20:37.283
let alone the few transporters
I could bring online.

20:37.354 --> 20:38.815
All right, then, we'll take a Jumper.

20:38.890 --> 20:41.127
Again, I come back to my question of how.

20:41.194 --> 20:42.656
We have no way of getting
to the Jumper Bay.

20:42.730 --> 20:45.513
We'll take one from the underwater bay,
fly it up to the tower,

20:45.578 --> 20:49.255
fire a drone through the window
and take out Michael's Jumper.

20:50.378 --> 20:51.425
What?

20:51.498 --> 20:54.695
No, no, that's a good plan, except
I see one small problem with that plan,

20:54.763 --> 20:57.796
which is that the underwater Jumper Bay
only has a couple of Jumpers in it.

20:57.866 --> 21:00.649
- Well, we only need one.
- Yes, well, the thing is...

21:00.715 --> 21:02.275
Both of them were severely damaged
in the flood.

21:02.347 --> 21:04.169
Neither of them is able to fly.

21:04.235 --> 21:07.617
That was two years ago, Radek.
McKay already fixed them.

21:08.587 --> 21:11.009
- You gotta be kidding me.
- It was the next thing on my list.

21:11.083 --> 21:14.117
- You said you were going to fix them.
- I know, and I was getting to it, I swear.

21:14.187 --> 21:17.002
- And you had two years!
- I was busy!

21:17.067 --> 21:19.937
Perhaps we should go down there
and see if we can fix one of them.

21:20.011 --> 21:23.360
That's a good idea, but I want you stay
here to try to override Michael's lockouts.

21:23.435 --> 21:24.613
Why don't I stay here and work on that?

21:24.683 --> 21:26.210
I mean, Zelenka can go with you
to the Jumper Bay.

21:26.284 --> 21:28.739
Because I want you to come with me
and fix those Jumpers

21:28.812 --> 21:31.300
like you said you were going to do
two years ago. Let's go.

21:31.371 --> 21:33.444
- Please tell me there's a transporter.
- Yes.

21:33.516 --> 21:34.890
Well, there's not one
by the Puddle Jumper Bay,

21:34.956 --> 21:37.890
- but there is one two levels down.
- That'll do.

21:46.156 --> 21:47.203
Nice.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.193
You can fight?

22:13.036 --> 22:14.946
Five years of kickboxing.

22:15.597 --> 22:18.019
- That's good to know.
What happened?

22:58.894 --> 23:01.382
It's Michael and his hybrids.
I counted three of them.

23:01.454 --> 23:03.429
I'm not sure how many more there are.
Probably not too many.

23:03.502 --> 23:05.226
They all had to fit in that Jumper.

23:05.294 --> 23:07.628
Unless more came through
on foot afterward.

23:07.982 --> 23:09.411
What do we do?

23:09.902 --> 23:12.586
Try to get to the armory, come back
and retake the Gate Room.

23:12.655 --> 23:15.022
Sounds like a plan.
You two, come with us.

23:15.086 --> 23:17.126
Banks, stay here with them,
keep everyone calm.

23:17.199 --> 23:20.876
And if any more hybrids show up,
just do what you did earlier.

23:27.055 --> 23:29.477
speak with you again.
It's urgent.

23:29.615 --> 23:31.044
Stay with him.

23:36.495 --> 23:37.837
What is it?

23:37.903 --> 23:42.181
We were finally able to decipher
the encryption on the self-destruct device.

23:42.256 --> 23:43.303
Good.

23:43.984 --> 23:45.926
Prepare the ship to leave.

23:46.192 --> 23:49.006
We'll arm the self-destruct and switch
the power back to Atlantis' systems

23:49.072 --> 23:53.033
a split-second before we leave.
The timing of the switch must be precise.

23:53.104 --> 23:55.886
I don't want to give them any opportunity
to disarm the device.

23:55.952 --> 23:57.959
I'll make the calculations.

24:01.712 --> 24:04.014
Change of plans.
We're not going to the armory.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.982
- Why? What happened?
- They armed the self-destruct.

24:07.056 --> 24:10.351
Mr. Woolsey, would you please
head back to the others?

24:25.680 --> 24:28.582
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla.
Can you hear me?

24:28.656 --> 24:30.991
John, this is Teyla. Please respond.

24:46.673 --> 24:48.135
Colonel...

24:48.658 --> 24:51.724
Colonel Sheppard. Ronon is in the
Control Room. He's fighting with Michael!

24:51.794 --> 24:54.576
We're almost at the Jumper Bay.
Keep us posted.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.079
Teyla, run!

25:19.058 --> 25:22.473
- Teyla. Are you all right?
- Yes, but Ronon needs our help.

25:22.546 --> 25:24.456
We need to get back up
to the Control Room.

25:48.403 --> 25:51.469
Radek? Tell us what's going on up there.

25:51.539 --> 25:55.019
I can't tell. Ronon is down.
He might just be unconscious.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.705
Tell me when he comes to.

25:57.907 --> 25:58.856
What have we got?

25:58.931 --> 26:00.906
It's like I said.
I mean, both of the Jumpers are toast.

26:00.979 --> 26:03.532
This one's got a whole whack of problems,
starting with zero power.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.163
You said the other Jumper's
got power, right?

26:05.235 --> 26:07.657
Yeah, but not much else. Drive pods
won't extend. There's no drones.

26:07.732 --> 26:08.747
And this one's got drones.

26:08.819 --> 26:11.722
So if we bring power over to this,
we can get the drive pods working, right?

26:11.795 --> 26:13.519
Okay, you want me to harvest parts
from both Jumpers,

26:13.588 --> 26:15.082
cobble together a fix
so one of them will work?

26:15.156 --> 26:16.814
- Is it possible?
- Doubtful.

26:16.883 --> 26:18.672
- But maybe.
- It's a long shot at best.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.107
Perfect. Get to it.
What do you need, 15 minutes?

26:25.460 --> 26:27.216
Great, just great.

26:32.724 --> 26:35.572
- Must've locked out the transporters.
- We need to get to the Control Room.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.043
It's too dangerous. Not without weapons.

26:37.108 --> 26:40.425
- Where's the nearest stairwell?
- Around the corner. This way.

26:40.500 --> 26:41.842
Let me lead.

28:23.767 --> 28:25.229
Okay, give 'er.

28:26.999 --> 28:30.228
- Drive pods are go.
- All right, now we're getting somewhere.

28:30.295 --> 28:33.940
I got juice, I got life support, I got...
Oh, come on!

28:34.008 --> 28:36.496
- What?
- The weapons won't come online.

28:37.336 --> 28:38.962
- Why not?
- I don't know.

28:39.032 --> 28:41.715
Well, figure it out. We need those drones.

28:47.736 --> 28:49.143
Where is she?

28:50.296 --> 28:52.717
We don't know. We searched everywhere.

28:52.792 --> 28:55.345
Are you telling me she just disappeared?

28:55.416 --> 28:57.588
I'm saying that we searched every room
and corridor

28:57.657 --> 29:00.821
within the stun field.
We couldn't find her anywhere.

29:00.889 --> 29:04.718
She knows this city well.
She's hiding somewhere.

29:04.792 --> 29:06.516
She's toying with me!

29:08.888 --> 29:11.605
- We'll keep looking.
- No. I'll handle this.

29:14.105 --> 29:16.494
- What are you going to do?
- Flush her out.

29:22.041 --> 29:25.008
That's Atlantis' self-destruct.
Michael's going to blow up the city.

29:25.081 --> 29:27.253
- How much time do we have?
- He set it for 10 minutes.

29:27.322 --> 29:29.394
How much time do you need
before you get those drones working?

29:29.465 --> 29:32.814
Well, if I can get them working at all,
a lot more than 10 minutes!

29:32.889 --> 29:35.191
- All right, forget about it.
- What are you... What are you doing?

29:35.257 --> 29:37.046
Gonna fly the Jumper
and crash it into the tower.

29:37.114 --> 29:38.062
Crash it?

29:38.137 --> 29:40.079
It's our best chance
of taking out Michael's Jumper.

29:40.154 --> 29:41.463
Not to mention taking out yourself.

29:41.529 --> 29:44.017
I have crashed Jumpers
into the tower before.

29:44.090 --> 29:45.584
Not like this, you haven't.

29:45.658 --> 29:48.408
Look, in addition to the weapons,
the inertial dampeners are out.

29:48.474 --> 29:49.586
You'll need to impact Michael's Jumper

29:49.657 --> 29:51.413
with enough force
to do some serious damage,

29:51.482 --> 29:53.685
which means a lot of speed
when you hit that tower.

29:53.754 --> 29:55.958
Look, this is a suicide mission.

30:01.019 --> 30:02.164
<i>Teyla!</i>

30:02.810 --> 30:04.632
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

30:05.242 --> 30:09.203
<i>That alarm, if you're not aware,
is Atlantis' self-destruct device.</i>

30:09.530 --> 30:12.018
<i>I've armed it, set it for 10 minutes.</i>

30:12.283 --> 30:15.861
<i>That is the amount of time you have
to consider the offer I'm about to make.</i>

30:16.890 --> 30:19.574
If you will surrender yourself
and your child to me,

30:19.643 --> 30:23.440
I'll disarm the device,
sparing the lives of everyone on this base.

30:23.514 --> 30:26.897
If not, you, your baby

30:26.971 --> 30:29.840
<i>and everyone else will die.</i>

30:37.275 --> 30:39.163
Okay, you're good to go.

30:39.643 --> 30:42.294
Make sure that strike team is ready
to move as soon as that field drops.

30:42.363 --> 30:43.989
I will. You make sure
you don't accelerate too fast

30:44.060 --> 30:46.198
coming out of the Jumper Bay.
I mean, if you hit the gas too hard,

30:46.267 --> 30:49.235
- you're going to flatten like a pancake.
- Right.

30:51.996 --> 30:53.043
What?

30:53.692 --> 30:56.026
Well, it's just...
What you're about to do is...

30:56.092 --> 30:59.769
Yeah. It's not like it's the first time.
How many suicide missions have I flown?

30:59.836 --> 31:02.771
- I don't know. I lost count.
- All right. Well, there you go.

31:02.844 --> 31:04.851
All right, well, you know...

31:05.724 --> 31:07.415
Here's to many more.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.382
<i>Rodney?</i>

31:14.172 --> 31:15.514
Yeah, Radek. Go ahead.

31:15.580 --> 31:18.264
<i>I've finally figured out how to override
some of Michael's lockout codes.</i>

31:18.332 --> 31:20.241
That's great.
Can you shut down the self-destruct?

31:20.316 --> 31:22.389
No. No, no,
that will take a little bit more time.

31:22.461 --> 31:25.014
I have, however, managed to get
the access doors to the Gate Room open.

31:25.085 --> 31:29.209
Well, that does us absolutely no good.
I mean, the stun field is still in effect.

31:29.277 --> 31:31.252
What about the transporter
on the Gate Room level?

31:31.324 --> 31:34.107
No, no, I still don't have
control of that, either.

31:34.173 --> 31:35.285
For crying out loud.

31:35.357 --> 31:36.852
<i>I'm sorry, I'm doing the best I can.</i>

31:36.925 --> 31:39.097
Michael has placed several
highly encrypted codes...

31:39.165 --> 31:40.441
Look, just...

31:40.509 --> 31:42.452
What about the gate shield?
Can you lower it?

31:42.525 --> 31:45.591
- Yes. That I can do.
- Great.

31:45.662 --> 31:49.077
- You don't have to do your kamikaze run.
- Why not?

31:49.150 --> 31:51.059
Well, you just have to fly up to the tower,
get in proximity,

31:51.133 --> 31:54.330
dial the DHD to a random planet,
we'll have Radek lower the gate shield,

31:54.398 --> 31:57.529
allowing the vortex to obliterate
Michael's Puddle Jumper, or most of it.

31:57.597 --> 31:59.485
Now, that's a good plan.

32:00.541 --> 32:02.232
- Where are you going?
- You're gonna fly it.

32:02.301 --> 32:04.538
- That frees me up to lead the strike team.
- You...

32:04.606 --> 32:07.421
Look, you said it yourself.
It's simple enough. You just dial the gate.

32:07.486 --> 32:10.301
- I guess I can do that.
- Go easy on the accelerator.

32:10.366 --> 32:13.334
Radek, get ready to drop that shield
on my mark.

32:15.038 --> 32:16.216
Right.

32:19.294 --> 32:22.523
We don't have much time.
We need to leave this place.

32:23.807 --> 32:25.530
Time is short, Teyla.

32:27.006 --> 32:30.584
I don't understand.
I would think the choice is an easy one.

32:31.231 --> 32:33.719
<i>If nothing else, consider your child.</i>

32:34.463 --> 32:37.278
<i>By remaining in hiding,
you are sentencing him to die.</i>

32:37.343 --> 32:40.026
<i>What kind of mother
would do such a thing?</i>

32:41.023 --> 32:42.910
<i>He has a chance to live.</i>

32:43.903 --> 32:45.364
<i>Both of you do.</i>

32:46.271 --> 32:47.962
Come with me, Teyla.

32:48.703 --> 32:49.913
Trust me.

32:50.879 --> 32:54.457
I will not harm either of you,
and I will not harm Atlantis.

32:56.287 --> 32:57.848
You have my word.

33:01.567 --> 33:03.901
<i>Turn off the self-destruct system.</i>

33:04.415 --> 33:05.528
Teyla?

33:06.367 --> 33:10.012
You want me to trust you?
Then show me you mean what you say.

33:10.848 --> 33:14.426
<i>Turn off the self-destruct system,
and I will come with you.</i>

33:32.768 --> 33:34.907
All right, I'm in the air,
approaching the central tower.

33:34.976 --> 33:37.081
Copy that. Zelenka, you ready?

33:37.184 --> 33:38.842
Ready when you are.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.427
Michael, can you hear me?

33:42.496 --> 33:46.009
Less than two minutes.
We need to go. Now.

33:46.080 --> 33:49.015
Yes, Teyla. I hear you.

33:52.129 --> 33:53.722
You disappoint me.

33:54.720 --> 33:57.110
So I will leave you
to the fate you have chosen,

33:57.185 --> 33:59.127
<i>but I'm not leaving alone.</i>

33:59.425 --> 34:02.970
<i>You should know that
I've already collected your son's DNA.</i>

34:03.169 --> 34:07.676
<i>Cloning him will require additional time,
delaying the implementation of my plan,</i>

34:07.746 --> 34:11.520
<i>but as you well know,
I will not be deterred.</i>

34:14.466 --> 34:15.927
Goodbye, Teyla.

34:33.889 --> 34:35.547
What are you doing?

34:35.681 --> 34:37.623
Collecting one last prize.

34:44.770 --> 34:46.909
I'm in position. Ready to dial.

34:47.042 --> 34:48.864
Radek, drop the shield.

34:54.242 --> 34:56.347
The shield's down! Go, Rodney!

35:00.035 --> 35:01.017
No!

35:28.036 --> 35:29.443
<i>Stun field is neutralized!</i>

35:29.507 --> 35:31.165
What about the self-destruct?
Is it disabled?

35:31.235 --> 35:33.374
Yes, yes. It shut off
when the Jumper's power was cut.

35:33.444 --> 35:36.411
Good. I'm heading back.
Go ahead and reboot the city's power.

35:36.483 --> 35:38.425
Yes, I'm already doing it.

36:05.348 --> 36:06.690
Get a medic!

36:09.765 --> 36:12.067
Close the Jumper Bay doors, Radek!

36:13.157 --> 36:14.302
Amelia.

36:16.613 --> 36:19.646
- Will you take care of Torren for me?
- Of course.

36:20.645 --> 36:22.532
Make sure no one leaves.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.105
Teyla!

38:59.561 --> 39:02.376
How's Dr. Keller's
most cantankerous patient?

39:02.441 --> 39:03.816
You've got to be kidding me.

39:03.882 --> 39:05.987
You get released
and I gotta stay here another day?

39:06.058 --> 39:08.163
Because I only fell down a flight of stairs.

39:08.234 --> 39:10.951
You, my friend, were hurled
from a much greater height.

39:11.018 --> 39:13.571
You're lucky you only suffered
a concussion and didn't break your neck.

39:13.642 --> 39:16.031
- Nothing. I'm fine.
- I know you are,

39:16.810 --> 39:18.720
but listen to the doctor.

39:19.850 --> 39:24.106
Anyway, I just wanted to drop by and
commend you for your exemplary work.

39:24.555 --> 39:28.035
Your courage in the face of danger
continues to amaze and,

39:28.554 --> 39:31.009
dare I say, inspire me.

39:34.347 --> 39:35.492
Thanks.

39:36.394 --> 39:37.736
Get some rest.

39:37.802 --> 39:40.290
And don't worry. Your team's not going
anywhere without you.

39:40.363 --> 39:41.890
That reminds me.

39:43.755 --> 39:45.828
I know Michael attacking the city
isn't really a mission,

39:45.899 --> 39:48.965
but I filed a report anyways.

39:50.763 --> 39:52.487
Well, splendid.

39:53.675 --> 39:54.951
Thank you.

39:58.156 --> 39:59.617
<i>Mission report.</i>

39:59.787 --> 40:01.696
<i>Michael invaded Atlantis,</i>

40:02.092 --> 40:03.652
<i>tried to blow it up.</i>

40:03.723 --> 40:05.185
<i>We stopped him.</i>

40:05.387 --> 40:06.816
<i>End of report.</i>

40:12.908 --> 40:16.618
Take a good long look, 'cause soon
you're gonna see nothing but tail lights.

40:16.684 --> 40:18.473
Nice try, Speed Racer.

40:24.908 --> 40:27.210
I'm sorry. Sorry, we were just, you know...

40:27.276 --> 40:28.258
Who's winning?

40:28.332 --> 40:29.925
- I am.
- I am. Yeah.

40:29.996 --> 40:31.337
Still colicky?

40:31.405 --> 40:33.860
He was awake all day.
Refused to take a nap.

40:33.933 --> 40:36.388
That's not surprising.
He got a full night's sleep.

40:36.461 --> 40:39.592
Yes, it's remarkable.
He slept through the entire ordeal.

40:39.660 --> 40:42.279
He hasn't slept through a whole night in...

40:42.349 --> 40:43.331
Ever.

40:43.404 --> 40:46.154
Well, he can rest easy now,
'cause Michael's finally out of the picture.

40:46.220 --> 40:48.522
Unfortunately, there will be
somebody else to take his place.

40:48.588 --> 40:51.305
- Of this, I am certain.
- He's got Supermom watching his back.

40:51.372 --> 40:53.674
If you ask me, he's in good hands.

40:53.933 --> 40:57.479
Torren, do you want to watch me
kick Rodney's ass?

40:58.637 --> 41:02.532
Actually, you may want to cover the
child's eyes, because this could get ugly.

41:02.605 --> 41:04.099
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

41:04.173 --> 41:05.383
One, two...

41:06.029 --> 41:07.239
Hey! Hey!
