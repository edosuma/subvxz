00:06.040 --> 00:07.600
Just tell us where the girl is.

00:07.670 --> 00:10.410
I told you I don't know.

00:10.470 --> 00:14.480
Okay, if you don't know, you don't know.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.880
Ahhh!

00:16.950 --> 00:17.810
Now, do you know?!

00:17.880 --> 00:19.850
Hey man, get your partner off of me!

00:19.920 --> 00:21.880
You better tell her what she wants to know.

00:21.950 --> 00:23.350
You got three seconds to talk.

00:23.420 --> 00:26.720
I... I don't... I... ahhh!

00:26.790 --> 00:29.590
She's in my basement.

00:29.660 --> 00:33.860
She's in my basement.

00:33.930 --> 00:37.700
Boring.

00:37.770 --> 00:38.830
That was boring?

00:38.900 --> 00:40.870
Yeah, it was all too predictable.

00:40.940 --> 00:45.270
There were no, ahhh, surprises.

00:45.340 --> 00:48.740
I enjoyed the slapping.

00:48.810 --> 00:51.950
See, entertainment is so
much more entertaining,

00:52.020 --> 00:55.050
when the characters do things
the audience doesn't expect.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.820
I don't get what you're trying to say here.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.720
You've bewildered everybody.

01:02.260 --> 01:03.390
All right, okay, maybe I'm wrong.

01:03.460 --> 01:06.630
Let's move on to something else.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.830
Let's talk about our hopes and dreams.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.370
Tori.

01:10.430 --> 01:11.770
Sikowitz.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.370
What's your biggest hope and/or dream?

01:15.440 --> 01:30.150
Uh... probably to be a pop star,
a really successful singer.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.250
What?

01:31.320 --> 01:35.320
Oh, well, maybe you could sing at weddings

01:35.390 --> 01:37.490
for the hearing impaired.

01:39.430 --> 01:43.530
Okay, this is the most fun class ever.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.100
You really don't think I
can make it as a singer?

01:46.170 --> 01:51.970
Nope.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.580
Ha! You see?

01:54.640 --> 01:57.380
You're all staring at
me with rapt attention.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.750
Why?

01:58.820 --> 02:04.490
Because as a teacher, you expect
me to encourage my students,

02:04.550 --> 02:08.419
not puke on their dreams.

02:08.490 --> 02:09.060
Right?

02:09.130 --> 02:09.729
Right.

02:09.789 --> 02:10.729
Uh-huh.

02:10.789 --> 02:12.700
This is what I was trying to explain.

02:12.760 --> 02:17.100
When characters do the
unexpected... oof...

02:17.170 --> 02:22.840
Audiences pay attention.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.210
Oh, I have a headache.

02:25.580 --> 02:26.380
That's lunchtime.

02:26.440 --> 02:30.150
Get out.

02:30.210 --> 02:32.720
Hey, Jade, that's a nice new sweater.

02:32.780 --> 02:33.980
Thanks.

02:34.050 --> 02:36.250
It's made out of puppet hair.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.790
Dang, woman.

02:38.860 --> 02:41.060
Tori, hang back a sec.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.690
No, I'm scared.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.860
Just listen.

02:45.930 --> 02:51.470
How would you like to
do something exciting?

02:51.530 --> 02:55.540
Uh... could I have more details?

02:55.610 --> 02:57.540
My friend Jenny is a casting director.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.840
She's working on a new movie.

02:59.910 --> 03:01.480
Movie?

03:01.540 --> 03:05.350
They need a spunky teenage
girl to play the best friend

03:05.420 --> 03:07.220
of the lead.

03:07.280 --> 03:11.820
Would you like to audition?

03:11.890 --> 03:14.190
Wow, I mean, I've never auditioned for,

03:14.260 --> 03:15.490
like, a real movie before.

03:15.560 --> 03:20.330
And I've never done a standing
backflip, but watch this.

03:20.400 --> 03:20.930
Yeaa!

03:21.000 --> 03:23.430
Oof.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.730

hi.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.950
Look at the new costume I made.

04:46.020 --> 04:49.420
Can you guess who I am?

04:49.430 --> 04:51.790
No.

04:51.860 --> 04:55.500
You're little boy poop.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.000
Little bo peep.

04:58.070 --> 04:59.900
All right, can I just tell
you guys how much I'm loving

04:59.970 --> 05:01.840
my new costume design class?

05:01.900 --> 05:03.940
Ohhh.

05:04.010 --> 05:05.970
And my teacher says I have a
gift for knowing people's

05:06.040 --> 05:07.980
exact measurements.

05:08.040 --> 05:08.880
Hey, peeperleez.

05:08.940 --> 05:11.480
I'm not with him.

05:11.550 --> 05:13.920
Hey, Robbie, want me to tell
you what size your pants are?

05:13.980 --> 05:14.780
I already know.

05:14.850 --> 05:18.220
They're a size four.

05:18.290 --> 05:19.650
Size four?

05:19.720 --> 05:20.190
Mm-hmm.

05:20.260 --> 05:22.220
That's how they measure girls' pants.

05:22.290 --> 05:23.220
What?

05:23.290 --> 05:25.890
Rex, you promised me
these were boys' jeans.

05:25.960 --> 05:29.630
Heh-heh-heh, you've been rexed.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.500
Hey, will you guys take a look
at my headshot and resume?

05:33.570 --> 05:34.900
Sure, what for?

05:34.970 --> 05:38.340
Sikowitz got me an audition for a movie.

05:38.410 --> 05:39.310
Wow.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.180
I don't care.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.680
You look 12 in this pic.

05:42.750 --> 05:43.950
Well, that was the last time I was shot

05:44.010 --> 05:45.780
by a professional photographer.

05:45.850 --> 05:50.080
My brother got shot by a clown.

05:50.150 --> 05:50.950
Why?

05:51.020 --> 05:52.820
Because my brother kept
poking him and saying,

05:52.890 --> 05:57.560
"whatcha gonna do about
it, clown, huh?"

05:57.630 --> 05:59.660
It happened on the bus.

05:59.730 --> 06:02.160
Cat, color the tiger.

06:02.230 --> 06:05.070
Yay, crayons.

06:05.130 --> 06:08.900
Well, now I have to find a
professional photographer.

06:08.970 --> 06:12.340
Did someone say she needs a
professional photographer?

06:12.410 --> 06:13.170
Yeah.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.310
Do you know one?

06:14.380 --> 06:17.010
No.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.750
Yeah, I don't seem so weird anymore, do I?

06:20.820 --> 06:23.580
What did you say, girl pants?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.790
All right, you gotta work on this resume.

06:25.850 --> 06:26.950
What? What's wrong with it?

06:27.020 --> 06:28.620
You only have one play on here.

06:28.690 --> 06:29.760
Well, that's all I've been in.

06:29.830 --> 06:30.560
So?

06:30.630 --> 06:32.760
Just say you've acted in more stuff.

06:32.830 --> 06:33.390
Lie?

06:33.460 --> 06:34.600
Yes.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.930
It's not relyly lying.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.030
It's exaggerating.

06:39.100 --> 06:42.940
Did I mention the clown
was my cousin Jesse?

06:43.010 --> 06:46.740
Color the pretty tiger.

06:46.810 --> 06:48.640
So, back to my resume.

06:48.710 --> 06:50.910
You gotta add more things
under special skills.

06:50.980 --> 06:52.580
Yeah, you put bike riding
as a special skill.

06:52.650 --> 06:53.820
Who can't ride a bike?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.380
Take a guess.

06:55.450 --> 06:56.920
Can you keep any secret?

06:56.990 --> 06:59.520
Mm-mm-mm.

06:59.590 --> 07:01.920
So, what special skills should I add?

07:01.990 --> 07:03.060
Gymnastics.

07:03.130 --> 07:03.990
Martial arts.

07:04.060 --> 07:05.230
Skydiving.

07:05.290 --> 07:06.630
Flirtatious hair flipping.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.000
Okay, I do not flip my hair flirtatiously.

07:09.060 --> 07:10.700
Oh, really?

07:10.770 --> 07:11.630
This doesn't look familiar.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.700
Why, hello boys, my name is Tori Vega.

07:14.770 --> 07:19.540
Buy me some licorice, and
I'll give you a kiss.

07:19.610 --> 07:21.610
I talk nothing like that.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.880
Seriously, do I talk anything like that?

07:23.950 --> 07:25.110
Why no.

07:25.180 --> 07:26.680
Not at all.

07:30.150 --> 07:36.160
Yikes! I'm about to audition for a real movie! Ahhh!!!

07:36.160 --> 07:39.370
Feeling: Terrified.

07:40.030 --> 07:40.830
Go do it.

07:40.900 --> 07:41.630
No.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.170
Tell him you love him before you lose him.

07:44.230 --> 07:46.200
But I'm afraid to tell him.

07:46.270 --> 07:48.240
Look, it's been a really, really long time

07:48.300 --> 07:50.400
since I've seen you be happy.

07:50.470 --> 07:56.610
But ever since you and keith...
how's your audition going?

07:56.680 --> 07:58.510
I'm... I'm in the middle of it.

07:58.580 --> 08:00.750
That's so exciting.

08:00.820 --> 08:04.720
I'm sorry, who is... uh... she
is my friend, Cat.

08:04.790 --> 08:06.650
Ah.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.490
You brought a superhero?

08:09.560 --> 08:13.630
I bet your left arm is 34 inches long.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.900
It is.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.430
Get out, Cat.

08:18.500 --> 08:23.870
Whoosh.

08:23.940 --> 08:25.340
I'm so sorry.

08:25.410 --> 08:26.810
Uh... where were we?

08:26.880 --> 08:29.410
I really don't need to see anymore.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.880
Oh, you don't?

08:31.950 --> 08:34.179
You're a fantastic actor.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.020
Really?

08:36.080 --> 08:37.890
So, I got the part?

08:37.950 --> 08:38.549
No.

08:38.620 --> 08:41.390
Oh.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.520
But only because you look
too much like the star.

08:43.590 --> 08:46.490
I was just thinking that.

08:46.560 --> 08:50.700
Ah, okay, that's... I totally get it.

08:50.770 --> 08:52.230
But... but?

08:52.300 --> 08:52.730
But what?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.700
I am sorry, I seem too eager, don't I?

08:54.770 --> 08:56.100
But what?

08:56.170 --> 08:57.770
How would you like to be a stunt double?

08:57.840 --> 09:00.540
I was just thinking that.

09:00.610 --> 09:07.380
A st... a stunt double?

09:07.450 --> 09:12.920
Look, I made my tiger purple.

09:12.990 --> 09:25.270
That doesn't happen in nature.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.940
So, I said okay.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.100
Really?

09:29.170 --> 09:31.540
I had no idea you did stunt work.

09:31.610 --> 09:32.170
I don't.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.370
I'm not a stunt double.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.740
Then why did you accept the job?

09:35.810 --> 09:36.340
I don't know.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.710
Because I'm stupid.

09:38.780 --> 09:40.110
I've been telling you people she's stupid,

09:40.180 --> 09:43.420
but did anyone believe me?

09:43.490 --> 09:43.990
All right, wait.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.520
Why'd they even offer you
a job as a stunt double?

09:46.590 --> 09:47.690
'Cause of my resume.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.360
Under special skills, I put
gymnastics and karate,

09:50.430 --> 09:52.630
and that made them think
that I could do stunts.

09:52.690 --> 09:53.160
See?

09:53.230 --> 09:58.700
You should never lie on your resume.

09:58.770 --> 10:01.500
Well, that's not a pretty face.

10:01.570 --> 10:03.270
Will you please just call
your casting director friend

10:03.340 --> 10:04.540
and get me out of this?

10:04.610 --> 10:06.540
You might not wanna do that.

10:06.610 --> 10:07.380
Why not?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.940
You wanna get blackballed in Hollywood?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.580
What do you mean blackballed?

10:11.650 --> 10:13.880
In this town, everybody knows everybody.

10:13.950 --> 10:19.890
You make people mad, word gets around.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.690
And then, no one will hire you.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.690
Great, so what do I do?

10:22.760 --> 10:25.930
Get blackballed or do a stunt
and get my face smashed?

10:25.990 --> 10:29.530
I think, you should do both.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.100
You know...
Stunt doubles rarely get injured.

10:33.170 --> 10:35.470
Yeah, but... and you told
them you'd do it...

10:35.540 --> 10:41.210
Which is a commitment, and
making a commitment is like...

10:41.280 --> 10:45.310
Well, take this coconut, for
example... brown, spherical,

10:45.380 --> 10:50.220
covered with short, fibrous hairs that...

10:50.290 --> 10:55.190
What were we talking about?

10:55.260 --> 10:58.460
So, what's the stunt you're
supposed to do anyway?

10:58.530 --> 11:01.160
Fall off a chair.

11:01.230 --> 11:03.060
Fall off a chair?

11:03.130 --> 11:05.130
That's the big stunt you're buggin' about?

11:05.200 --> 11:08.740
Hah, you big baby.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.400
Well, it could be dangerous.

11:10.470 --> 11:11.710
I'm not a professional stunt girl.

11:11.770 --> 11:14.210
I don't know how to fall off a
chair and make it look real.

11:14.280 --> 11:16.250
And what if... aah!

11:18.190 --> 11:19.590
Looked good to me.

11:20.880 --> 11:27.000
Well, I now have boot print on my right kidney. Thank you, Jade.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.140
Feeling: Sore.

11:35.830 --> 11:36.460
The last one was the best.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.330
I know.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.070
Oh, no.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.500
... But look at what's going on here.

11:39.570 --> 11:42.040
Ah, there she is, uh... Tori.

11:42.100 --> 11:42.840
Tori, right.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.610
I'm sorry, I spit on you.

11:45.670 --> 11:47.070
That's okay.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.640
Patrice, this is your stunt double.

11:48.710 --> 11:49.410
Hi.

11:49.480 --> 11:50.910
I'm gonna fall off your chair.

11:50.980 --> 11:53.410
I appreciate it.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.920
Okay, is this our girl?

11:54.980 --> 11:55.520
Yeah.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.450
Tori, this is our stunt coordinator, gene.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.320
Good to meet you.

11:59.390 --> 12:00.890
Really simple stunt.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.790
Right, simple stunt.

12:02.860 --> 12:06.190
Got your chair right here...
my chair right there?

12:06.260 --> 12:07.260
... Which you're gonna sit on.

12:07.330 --> 12:09.060
I sit on it.

12:09.130 --> 12:12.870
When the director calls action,
you just fall off the chair.

12:12.930 --> 12:14.370
I fall off the chair.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.470
And through that railing, drop 40 feet,

12:16.540 --> 12:20.370
and hit the ground down there.

12:20.440 --> 12:26.850
Through the... and drop, and
hit the... whoa, through...

12:26.920 --> 12:29.120
I have to fall all the way down there?

12:29.180 --> 12:30.680
Onto the air sack.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.360
Now, just don't miss the sack,
like the last stunt double.

12:35.420 --> 12:38.090
Get outta here.

12:38.160 --> 12:38.630
Wait, wait, wait.

12:38.690 --> 12:40.460
The last stunt double missed the sack?

12:40.530 --> 12:42.830
Just by a few feet.

12:42.900 --> 12:46.900
Hey, put the air sack in the
right place this time, would ya?

12:46.970 --> 12:49.470
Get that dried blood off the floor.

12:49.540 --> 12:50.580
Roger.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.074

13:03.440 --> 13:04.600
No, no, no, you don't understand.

13:04.670 --> 13:07.410
See, I was told, I would
just be falling off a chair.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.540
Exactly, off the chair, through
the railing, plummeting 40 feet.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.180
Honey, I am in the middle of shooting.

13:14.250 --> 13:14.750
I don't care.

13:14.820 --> 13:15.920
Your son's been bitten by monkeys!

13:15.980 --> 13:17.580
All right, all right, I'll meet
you in the emergency room.

13:17.650 --> 13:18.050
Hurry up!

13:18.120 --> 13:19.790
I have a hair appointment.

13:19.850 --> 13:22.490
Hey, hey, everybody?

13:22.560 --> 13:26.860
Uh... that was my "wife" on the phone.

13:26.930 --> 13:30.000
She took my son to the zoo,
and apparently, he was bitten

13:30.060 --> 13:32.670
by several monkeys.

13:32.730 --> 13:33.630
I gotta get to the hospital.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.900
So, that's a wrap for the day.

13:35.970 --> 13:36.840
All right, everybody.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.740
We'll do the stunt later in the week.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.140
Bye.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.310
Thank you, monkeys!

13:42.380 --> 13:43.740
Whoo, Whoo.

13:43.810 --> 13:45.260
We have names.

13:46.030 --> 13:50.500
Omg! I was just saved by mean monkeys I don't even know!

13:50.500 --> 13:53.000
Thank you monkeys!!!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.400
Feeling: Relieved.

13:58.430 --> 14:01.660
Wait, who got bit by monkeys?

14:01.730 --> 14:03.130
The director's kid.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.670
Did he taunt the monkeys?

14:06.730 --> 14:08.570
I don't think you should do the stunt.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.370
I have to.

14:09.440 --> 14:13.010
I'll get blackballed in
Hollywood if I back out.

14:13.070 --> 14:15.140
I don't wanna get blackballed.

14:15.210 --> 14:16.410
Then just do it.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.080
And what if I end up in the hospital?

14:18.150 --> 14:21.450
Well, maybe you'll meet a handsome
young doctor, get married,

14:21.520 --> 14:24.920
and share a soda pop.

14:24.990 --> 14:28.960
I don't talk like a movie
star from the 194os.

14:29.020 --> 14:33.390
Oh my God, I love your dress.

14:33.460 --> 14:34.360
Thanks.

14:34.430 --> 14:38.330
It's what I wear in the movie, when I die.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.870
Um, Cat, what up with the crazy costume?

14:40.940 --> 14:45.240
I'm sikowitz.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.110
That's a great costume.

14:47.170 --> 14:50.110
Maybe you can dress me for my funeral.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.610
I could so do that.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.720
Come on now, there's not
gonna be a funeral.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.750
Aww.

14:57.820 --> 14:59.950
We're all gonna come down
to the set, keep ya cool,

15:00.020 --> 15:03.420
watch you land safe and sound,
right on that air sack.

15:03.490 --> 15:06.390
Unless you miss it.

15:06.460 --> 15:25.040
I don't think you'll miss it.

15:25.110 --> 15:38.420
No, no, no!

15:38.490 --> 15:40.990
I've never been treated so disrespectfully.

15:41.060 --> 15:42.430
> Will you just calm down?

15:42.500 --> 15:45.570
No, I'm outraged.

15:45.630 --> 15:47.930
You don't need a visitor's pass.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.270
You and Robbie got visitors' passes.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.270
The wicked witch here got a visitor's pass.

15:53.340 --> 15:55.210
Here.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.690
No, let me go, no.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.960
Hey, you look great.

16:09.020 --> 16:13.630
Okay.

16:13.690 --> 16:16.260
Let's put these on.

16:16.330 --> 16:20.000
Clear the set please.

16:20.070 --> 16:20.930
Hi.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.370
Yay, Cat made another costume.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.640
Look, I'm Cat, international spy.

16:26.710 --> 16:27.740
Pew! Pew! Pew!

16:29.980 --> 16:33.480
It's not real.

16:33.550 --> 16:35.320
So, when does Tori do her fall?

16:35.380 --> 16:37.120
All right, let's do one.

16:37.180 --> 16:38.890
Oh, here we go.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.330
Positions, everyone.

16:46.390 --> 16:47.790
Time for work, people.

16:47.860 --> 16:50.030
Quiet on set, please.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.470
Dan has notes.

16:52.530 --> 16:56.900
Last looks, everyone.

17:00.140 --> 17:01.040
Hey, Tori.

17:01.110 --> 17:03.410
I don't care what you do,
just get me out of this.

17:03.480 --> 17:03.940
Don't worry.

17:04.010 --> 17:07.050
You're gonna land right
on that big comfy sack.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.450
Cellphones off, please.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.250
I've been reprimanded.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.650
Gotta go.

17:10.720 --> 17:11.349
No.

17:11.420 --> 17:12.450
No, no, no, don't go.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.290
Don't go.

17:13.349 --> 17:15.920
You went.

17:17.390 --> 17:18.420
Rolling.

17:18.490 --> 17:20.329
Speed.

17:20.390 --> 17:26.869
Scene 21 apple, take 1.

17:26.930 --> 17:28.430
Ready, Tori?

17:28.500 --> 17:31.100
Yeah.

17:31.170 --> 17:32.870
All right.

17:32.940 --> 17:37.410
And...
Action!

17:37.480 --> 17:39.550
Ahh, eh.

17:39.610 --> 17:45.990
Now read the note and spill
the coffee and fall.

17:49.790 --> 17:51.120
Cut!

17:51.960 --> 17:53.190
Tori, what happened?

17:53.260 --> 17:54.630
I fell the other way.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.530
I think it worked pretty well.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.700
No, it didn't.

17:58.770 --> 18:02.900
You need to fall this way,
through the railing.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.900
Right.

18:04.970 --> 18:06.970
Okay.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.070
Resetting.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.810
Rolling.

18:10.880 --> 18:11.880
Speed.

18:11.950 --> 18:14.750
Hold.

18:14.820 --> 18:18.950
Scene 21 a, take 2.

18:19.020 --> 18:22.920
And action.

18:24.590 --> 18:26.630
One sec.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.430
Uh... what's goin' on up there?

18:28.500 --> 18:31.660
I-uh... I got a text message:

18:31.730 --> 18:34.230
I have to pee.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.970
You got a text message
that you have to pee?

18:37.040 --> 18:42.540
It's a new app called pee minder.

18:42.610 --> 18:45.780
Back in a sec.

18:45.850 --> 18:46.810
Pee minder?

18:46.880 --> 18:48.180
You should download that.

18:48.250 --> 18:53.020
Yeah, you should.

18:53.090 --> 19:00.060
By the... Tori, he's over there.

19:00.130 --> 19:04.430
Beck, Beck.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.200
Beck.

19:05.270 --> 19:09.870
Yes?

19:09.940 --> 19:10.870
Beck?

19:10.940 --> 19:11.640
I'm not Beck.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.070
I'm you.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.810
Wait, wait, but how
did you... where'd...

19:15.880 --> 19:17.440
Where'd you get that dress?

19:17.510 --> 19:20.010
Cat made it.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.450
Are you sweating?

19:21.520 --> 19:25.950
Yeah, I think I'm having an anxiety attack.

19:26.020 --> 19:26.820
I don't wanna do the stunt.

19:26.890 --> 19:28.190
I'm scared.

19:28.260 --> 19:31.020
It's okay, I got this.

19:31.090 --> 19:33.860
Wait, what are you...?

19:33.930 --> 19:34.630
Shh.

19:34.700 --> 19:40.300
Wait here.

19:40.370 --> 19:48.940
Wow, do I look that good running away?

19:49.010 --> 19:50.810
Just search the app store.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.740
They don't have pee minder.

19:51.810 --> 19:55.310
All I can find is tinkle time.

19:55.380 --> 19:59.990
I've got squirt alert.

20:00.050 --> 20:01.720
There goes Tori.

20:01.790 --> 20:06.130
Yeah, she's so cute when
she's running away.

20:06.190 --> 20:18.670
Yeah, she is.

20:18.740 --> 20:20.070
All right, we're back.

20:20.140 --> 20:21.940
Tori, you set?

20:22.010 --> 20:25.950
Ready.

20:26.010 --> 20:27.180
Rolling.

20:27.250 --> 20:28.050
Speed.

20:29.550 --> 20:33.820
Scene 21 apple, take 3.

20:33.890 --> 20:36.220
Action!

20:36.290 --> 20:43.060
Pick up your coffee, read the note,

20:43.130 --> 20:47.870
and spill the coffee and fall!

20:50.770 --> 20:52.240
And cut.

20:52.310 --> 20:53.970
Perfect.

20:55.740 --> 20:56.480
Thanks everyone.

20:56.540 --> 20:59.610
Be right back.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.110
Wooo!

21:01.180 --> 21:03.350
Uh-huh.

21:03.420 --> 21:04.550
Did everyone enjoy my stunt?

21:04.620 --> 21:09.220
I know, I did.

21:09.290 --> 21:10.790
See, it wasn't so bad, was it?

21:10.860 --> 21:12.660
No, it was fun.

21:12.730 --> 21:13.490
You wanna do another take?

21:13.510 --> 21:15.180
No, I do not.

21:20.820 --> 21:27.000
Wooo! I did my stunt. Kinda. Sorta. Well... ah, shut up.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.080
Feeling: Guilty.

21:32.610 --> 21:36.350
Pleeeease?

21:36.420 --> 21:37.420
Why?

21:37.480 --> 21:39.750
'Cause I'm mad at myself
for chickening out.

21:39.820 --> 21:42.220
I feel like a weenie.

21:42.290 --> 21:44.620
The world needs weenies.

21:44.690 --> 21:47.490
Without weenies, who'd wear turtlenecks?

21:47.560 --> 21:49.360
I gotta do the stunt.

21:49.430 --> 21:50.430
Look, why don't you just...?

21:50.500 --> 21:52.000
Come on, just call your
casting director friend

21:52.070 --> 21:53.170
and get us on the set.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.770
Please.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.770
Very well.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.300
Yay, thanks.

21:58.370 --> 22:00.470
Mm-hmm.

22:00.540 --> 22:03.310
Hey, why are you upside down?

22:03.380 --> 22:09.480
Why are you right side up?

22:09.550 --> 22:10.650
You ready for this?

22:10.720 --> 22:13.550
You can do it, Tori.

22:15.820 --> 22:16.720
Come on, Tori.

22:16.790 --> 22:19.960
It's a long fall.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.730
Okay, here I go.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.560
Here I go.

22:24.630 --> 22:27.900
Here I go.

22:27.970 --> 22:30.500
I can't do it.

22:30.570 --> 22:36.210
Don't be a weenie.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.810
Okay, I'm gonna count to 3.

22:39.880 --> 22:40.980
No, no, 10.

22:41.050 --> 22:46.050
I'm gonna count to 10, and
then, I'm go... [Screaming]

22:48.060 --> 22:54.190
Aah.

22:54.260 --> 22:56.500
You're ever so welcome.

22:56.560 --> 23:02.970
I don't talk like that.

23:03.040 --> 23:03.770
You made it.
