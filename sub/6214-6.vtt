WEBVTT

00:02.371 --> 00:04.896
I think we got
some great shots here.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.172
You look pretty cute in this one.

00:07.343 --> 00:09.311
Oh, no. "Cute" is exactly
what I'm not going for.

00:09.478 --> 00:10.843
This is for my byline picture.

00:11.013 --> 00:13.072
This photo has to make me look
super-hip.

00:13.249 --> 00:16.218
Digital cameras are high-tech,
but they're not magic.

00:16.385 --> 00:17.784
Magic? You mean like this?

00:19.054 --> 00:21.648
Hey. I'm just trying to help.

00:21.824 --> 00:23.189
Maybe there's something
you could do

00:23.359 --> 00:26.192
to look more, you know, writerly.

00:26.362 --> 00:29.160
Like what?
Smoke a pipe and grow a beard?

00:29.799 --> 00:32.631
I am telling you,
he couldn't keep his eyes off of me.

00:32.802 --> 00:34.497
Fine, whatever.

00:34.670 --> 00:35.864
Oh, well, good morning.

00:36.038 --> 00:38.268
Look who's finally home
from the concert last night.

00:38.441 --> 00:39.669
So who you fighting about?

00:39.842 --> 00:42.140
The, uh, guy selling glowsticks,
or the guy saying:

00:42.311 --> 00:43.642
"Please exit to the right. "

00:43.813 --> 00:46.714
The drummer, Clive Rexford.

00:46.882 --> 00:52.650
He looked directly at me and said,
"I want you. I need you. "

00:52.822 --> 00:54.585
Those are the words to the song.

00:54.757 --> 00:57.351
So, what does Mr. Morgan Cavanaugh
look like?

00:57.526 --> 00:58.788
Yeah, is he hot?

01:00.095 --> 01:03.030
What? I was just trying to fit in.

01:04.733 --> 01:07.531
He's gorgeous.

01:07.703 --> 01:08.727
I think.

01:08.904 --> 01:11.668
We were in the really cheap seats,
so he looked like an ant,

01:11.841 --> 01:14.708
only with long hair
and this gothic makeup.

01:14.877 --> 01:17.869
Huh. Sort of like,
"Honey, I shrunk Marilyn Manson"?

01:18.380 --> 01:21.213
You know what?
I am gonna go send him an e-mail.

01:22.051 --> 01:23.348
Just watch, in five minutes

01:23.519 --> 01:26.545
she'll ask for
an English-to-British dictionary.

01:27.556 --> 01:30.389
- Come on, we gotta pick a photo.
- Ooh, too dorky.

01:30.559 --> 01:31.787
Uh, how about this one?

01:31.961 --> 01:33.053
Too BjÃ¶rk-y.

01:33.229 --> 01:36.130
- This?
- Ooh, too Mickey Rourke-y.

01:36.298 --> 01:37.390
Forget it.

01:37.566 --> 01:40.535
I'll just use the picture
that traffic light took of me.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.882 --> 02:28.645
Morning, guys. What's the chat?

02:28.817 --> 02:31.547
- Uh, just the usual guy talk.
- Yeah, right now we're talking about

02:31.720 --> 02:34.120
what we're looking for
in a serious relationship.

02:34.290 --> 02:35.985
- Really?
- Really.

02:36.158 --> 02:40.891
I'm looking for a woman with depth,
a woman of substance.

02:41.063 --> 02:43.258
I'm looking for a woman
who just wants to cuddle.

02:43.432 --> 02:46.230
And I'm looking for an explanation
for this bizarre behavior.

02:46.402 --> 02:48.131
Hey, what's with them?

02:48.304 --> 02:50.966
Oh, I, uh, set up webcams
around the office.

02:51.140 --> 02:52.368
I'm gonna edit the footage down

02:52.541 --> 02:56.341
<i>and put a "Behind the Scenes
at Scorch " feature on the website.</i>

02:56.512 --> 02:58.503
- My idea.
- I see.

02:58.681 --> 03:01.013
Let the folks at home
in on all the exciting typing

03:01.183 --> 03:03.174
and photocopying
that goes on around here?

03:03.352 --> 03:06.651
I got lots of killer stuff already.
I got 20 minutes of Cole flexing.

03:07.690 --> 03:08.714
Not that I'm into that.

03:09.692 --> 03:12.855
Hey, lick your lips a little bit.
You'll look better on camera.

03:13.028 --> 03:15.292
There's a camera on my desk too?

03:15.698 --> 03:17.563
Yours, mine, everybody's.

03:17.733 --> 03:20.668
And I would get
that mole on your neck looked at.

03:20.836 --> 03:22.326
That's a beauty mark.

03:22.504 --> 03:24.335
I can't work like this.

03:27.309 --> 03:29.277
Annie, I'm launching
an official complaint.

03:29.445 --> 03:31.572
It's these webcams
that Leonard put on everyone's desk.

03:31.747 --> 03:33.874
I don't want the whole world
watching my every move.

03:34.049 --> 03:36.711
Don't worry. Leonard promised
to cut out all the boring stuff.

03:36.885 --> 03:39.046
- I think you're safe.
- How am I supposed to do my work

03:39.221 --> 03:40.882
if I'm worried about how I look?

03:41.056 --> 03:43.422
If you're not satisfied
with your appearance, change it.

03:43.592 --> 03:45.992
If you're not gonna do something,
then I'm gonna protest.

03:46.595 --> 03:48.563
<i>Scorch magazine has no right
to broadcast my image</i>

03:48.731 --> 03:51.495
without my consent.
And this woman... Humph.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.396
- Is violating my privacy.

03:53.569 --> 03:55.161
You're shouting into my lip gloss.

03:56.805 --> 03:57.897
Oh.

03:58.073 --> 03:59.199
Very Berry.

04:00.142 --> 04:01.166
It's nice.

04:06.582 --> 04:07.947
Hello?

04:08.951 --> 04:11.283
Anyway, you would not believe
how everyone around the office

04:11.453 --> 04:12.784
has been playing to these webcams.

04:12.955 --> 04:15.822
I, for one, am not gonna change
myself for a bunch of stupid cameras.

04:15.991 --> 04:18.892
You know, I'm a writer, not a model.
Excuse me?

04:19.728 --> 04:22.720
Oh, my fault,
the waiter outfit fooled me.

04:22.898 --> 04:26.163
Our society has such unreasonable
standards for female beauty.

04:26.335 --> 04:28.166
You're just saying that
because you're short.

04:28.871 --> 04:32.602
I'm petite. And I happen to be
very comfortable with it.

04:32.775 --> 04:34.402
Excuse me,
I have to go to the restroom.

04:39.548 --> 04:42.847
Hey, excuse me. Hi.
Uh, would it help if I were drowning?

04:44.687 --> 04:46.314
Oh, I got a text message.

04:46.488 --> 04:48.888
It's from Clive, that cute drummer.

04:49.758 --> 04:51.385
He's asking me out.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.427
Someone you've never met before
just e-mailed you for a date?

04:54.596 --> 04:57.292
I know. I don't like this whole
high-tech-dating thing either.

04:57.466 --> 05:01.197
I mean, call me old-fashioned,
but what happened to romance?

05:01.370 --> 05:04.999
What happened to courtship?
What happened to pitching woo?

05:05.174 --> 05:07.472
Ooh, I think he was traded
to the Yankees.

05:07.643 --> 05:09.406
Hey, Sabrina, Morgan.

05:09.578 --> 05:10.602
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:10.779 --> 05:11.939
Uh, this is Tina.

05:12.114 --> 05:14.173
Word of warning,
the service here is really slow.

05:14.349 --> 05:17.443
I'm sorry, miss.
Uh, would you like a table? A menu?

05:17.619 --> 05:19.109
Just a cup of coffee to go.

05:19.288 --> 05:20.550
Uh, can I get a glass of water?

05:20.723 --> 05:21.917
I'll grind the beans myself.

05:22.091 --> 05:24.889
Or anything heavy to throw at you.

05:25.561 --> 05:27.529
Is, uh, Tina your girlfriend?

05:27.696 --> 05:29.664
Um, no, we're just hanging out.

05:29.832 --> 05:32.232
Oh, yeah, you said you were looking
for a woman of substance.

05:32.401 --> 05:34.426
I guess that substance is saline.

05:35.003 --> 05:36.971
Do you have a problem
with my date?

05:37.139 --> 05:39.699
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sure you find her
very easy on the eyes.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.240
Even easier on the brain.

05:41.410 --> 05:42.468
Meow.

05:44.046 --> 05:46.105
Where's that waiter
with your saucer of milk?

05:46.682 --> 05:49.173
I'm all set. Nice to meet you.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.016
Usually.

05:52.721 --> 05:54.154
Can you believe that guy?

05:54.323 --> 05:56.382
That was a guy?

05:57.626 --> 05:59.594
Wow, very convincing.

06:00.262 --> 06:01.286
Weirdest thing.

06:01.697 --> 06:03.688
I asked that drummer, Clive,
to be on my radio show,

06:03.866 --> 06:05.925
and he just called back
and asked me out.

06:06.101 --> 06:08.831
I'm really sorry, Morgan.
Looks like destiny has spoken.

06:09.438 --> 06:12.532
Well, guess what?
Clive asked me out too.

06:12.708 --> 06:15.108
Looks like destiny has call waiting.

06:15.277 --> 06:16.972
- What?
- Yeah, and he called me first so...

06:17.146 --> 06:18.704
Well, you know what?
I'm afraid you're...

06:18.881 --> 06:21.179
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jan, Marcia, time out.

06:21.350 --> 06:23.215
Why don't you guys
both go out with the cute boy

06:23.385 --> 06:24.511
and see who he likes better?

06:24.686 --> 06:27.382
Well, okay.

06:27.556 --> 06:29.148
But I'm Marcia.

06:29.658 --> 06:30.784
Hey, hey. You know what?

06:30.959 --> 06:33.519
I have been trying to get your attention
for 20 minutes.

06:33.896 --> 06:35.193
I'm sorry. Uh...

06:35.364 --> 06:38.492
Here. Pay the cashier.

06:38.901 --> 06:43.304
Well, just for that,
I am not gonna have a nice day.

06:43.872 --> 06:45.066
A story.

06:45.240 --> 06:49.336
A story about what's hot.

06:50.445 --> 06:52.709
I wonder why the number one
never caught on?

06:52.881 --> 06:55.907
You call yourself a fashion writer?
Peasant blouses are out.

06:56.351 --> 06:59.912
The only people who are wearing
peasant blouses are actual peasants!

07:07.996 --> 07:10.726
Ooh, Stella McCartney,
eat your heart out.

07:10.899 --> 07:14.494
Wait, I'm a writer not a model.

07:17.506 --> 07:19.406
Hey, Sabrina,
you've gotta come see this.

07:19.575 --> 07:23.602
I got some great footage at lunch
of James tweezing his eyebrows.

07:23.779 --> 07:25.838
Wow, and this is a free website?

07:26.014 --> 07:29.108
Heh. To think I almost didn't put
a camera by that water cooler.

07:30.786 --> 07:32.413
Water cooler?

07:34.389 --> 07:36.550
They caught me doing magic.
You realize what this means?

07:36.725 --> 07:39.193
I don't know.
Six more weeks of winter?

07:39.361 --> 07:41.158
I have to get rid of the evidence.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.992
Argh! This stupid spell book
hasn't caught up with technology.

07:44.166 --> 07:47.329
The best it can do
is exorcize a demon-infested Atari.

07:48.070 --> 07:50.231
So fix it the old-fashioned way.

07:50.405 --> 07:52.669
Have saber-wielding assassins
storm the office

07:52.841 --> 07:54.468
and hack up the computers.

07:54.877 --> 07:58.142
Ooh, that's it. I'll just hack
into Leonard's computer and edit it out.

07:58.313 --> 07:59.439
Thanks, Salem.

08:00.816 --> 08:03.546
You know, just for that, from now on
I'm gonna check underneath my car

08:03.719 --> 08:05.983
before I back out of the driveway.

08:10.225 --> 08:11.419
- It's Clive.
He's here.

08:11.593 --> 08:13.754
I mean, was that the doorbell?

08:20.569 --> 08:22.935
Hi, I'm Clive Rexford.

08:24.473 --> 08:27.237
Did something happen
to Clive Junior?

08:28.243 --> 08:29.540
Oh, no, no.

08:29.711 --> 08:32.703
He and the little munchkins
are doing just great.

08:32.881 --> 08:35.111
I've got photos.

08:35.484 --> 08:37.918
Wait, you're the drummer
from Spinster Embryo?

08:38.086 --> 08:39.417
Clive Rexford?

08:39.587 --> 08:41.613
That's what it says on me meds.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.691
Ooh, you look different up close
without your makeup,

08:44.860 --> 08:47.522
and apparently your wig.

08:47.696 --> 08:50.392
So, girls, shall we go grab a bite?

08:50.766 --> 08:52.666
- You go ahead.
- I don't know.

08:52.834 --> 08:55.598
I have a lot of hair to wash.

08:56.138 --> 08:59.801
Well, I made dinner reservations
for three. Don't bail on me.

09:01.310 --> 09:02.538
- Okay.
- All right.

09:02.711 --> 09:04.372
Heh, brilliant.
Now, we've gotta scurry

09:04.546 --> 09:07.709
because this coupon
is only good till 7.

09:19.528 --> 09:21.086
Okay, let's see.

09:21.263 --> 09:23.697
If I were Leonard's computer,
what would my password be?

09:24.599 --> 09:26.328
Enterprise?

09:26.501 --> 09:29.595
Um... Lovemeister?

09:30.372 --> 09:32.067
Sabrina?

09:32.407 --> 09:33.465
Phew!

09:33.675 --> 09:37.372
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to
go in and get it out manually.

09:43.018 --> 09:44.576
Oh! Ow.

09:44.753 --> 09:47.517
Ah. Well, so much
for that beauty mark.

09:52.394 --> 09:56.353
I understand the foot thing,
it's the hoof that worries me.

09:56.798 --> 09:58.561
Webcam.

10:00.869 --> 10:03.963
Ah, water cooler.

10:05.307 --> 10:07.468
Zoinks.

10:08.477 --> 10:09.501
Shaggy?

10:09.678 --> 10:12.238
Um, like, at your service.
And Scooby-Doo.

10:12.414 --> 10:13.608
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

10:14.016 --> 10:16.075
<i>- What are you guys doing here?
Screen saver.</i>

10:16.251 --> 10:17.946
<i>Hey, can you do me a favor?</i>

10:18.120 --> 10:19.553
Can't you get us off this computer?

10:19.721 --> 10:22.849
Even Scoob's embarrassed
to be on this dude's PC.

10:23.025 --> 10:24.583
Sorry, I don't do Windows.

10:27.796 --> 10:28.820
What's happening?

10:28.997 --> 10:30.692
We're, like, shut down for the night.

10:32.067 --> 10:33.830
But I don't belong here.

10:34.002 --> 10:36.232
I gotta get out!

10:36.905 --> 10:39.169
No!

10:48.250 --> 10:49.581
Well, what do you know?

10:49.751 --> 10:51.685
Hey, James, check this out.

10:54.189 --> 10:56.214
Somebody's got a crush on me.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.585
Yeah, but why would
that big hairy dude from shipping

10:59.761 --> 11:01.456
send you a picture of Sabrina?

11:03.698 --> 11:06.531
I gotta say,
that Sabrina is pretty cute.

11:06.701 --> 11:08.066
Really?

11:08.236 --> 11:09.760
Well, let's see if you think she's cute

11:09.938 --> 11:12.736
if she looks like
old Zeke the prospector?

11:17.846 --> 11:21.942
No, I like Sabrina
just the way she is.

11:22.184 --> 11:24.448
Although, it never hurts
to have a couple of Shoshanas.

11:28.090 --> 11:29.614
- Ooh.
- Ha, ha!

11:29.791 --> 11:31.759
Well, if you're gonna
enhance the chassis,

11:31.927 --> 11:35.124
you might as well jack up the rear
and give her a new paint job.

11:35.297 --> 11:36.321
Oh, yeah.

11:41.103 --> 11:42.297
Hello?

11:42.904 --> 11:45.702
We are supposed to be having
an editorial meeting in my office, guys.

11:45.874 --> 11:46.966
Let's go.

11:47.142 --> 11:49.235
- All right.
Ahem.

11:58.053 --> 11:59.452
Oops. Heh.

12:00.822 --> 12:02.346
Oh, no.

12:02.524 --> 12:06.153
Oh, please tell me
this is just really strong hairspray.

12:12.567 --> 12:15.001
- Sabrina?
- Yeah?

12:15.170 --> 12:16.728
We're about to start the meeting.

12:16.905 --> 12:18.236
Oh, okay.

12:18.406 --> 12:20.135
Oh, I dropped my pencil. Ha, ha.

12:20.308 --> 12:21.468
Yeah, it's rolling.

12:22.244 --> 12:23.939
Still rolling.

12:28.683 --> 12:30.708
Still rolling.

12:30.886 --> 12:32.945
Hey, while I'm down here,
you want a pedicure?

12:36.324 --> 12:38.315
Okay, I know I suggested
you change your appearance,

12:38.493 --> 12:40.085
but I'm not sure
the Pamela Anderson look

12:40.262 --> 12:41.286
is the image you want.

12:41.463 --> 12:45.422
Oh, these aren't mine.
I'm, uh, carrying them for a friend.

12:49.971 --> 12:51.598
Sabrina.

12:51.773 --> 12:54.333
What happened to you?
You got such big...

12:54.509 --> 12:55.703
...hair.

12:55.877 --> 12:59.836
Yeah, it's a new shampoo.
Uh, they say it adds body. Ha, ha.

13:00.515 --> 13:01.812
And they're not lying.

13:01.983 --> 13:04.679
Yeah, maybe
I shouldn't rinse and repeat. Ha, ha.

13:04.853 --> 13:06.377
Gotta go.

13:16.264 --> 13:17.663
Unh, darn it.

13:17.832 --> 13:21.097
If you're here, who's co-hosting
the Country Music Awards?

13:21.269 --> 13:22.793
Sabrina, can we...?

13:22.971 --> 13:24.996
Wow, what's up with this getup?

13:25.173 --> 13:29.803
Oh, well, uh, Roxie, I would expect you
of all people to know.

13:29.978 --> 13:33.038
I have adopted this outrageous look
to make a statement

13:33.215 --> 13:36.480
about society's unreasonable
expectations of female beauty.

13:37.018 --> 13:40.215
Oh, she's telling women
to be prettier.

13:40.388 --> 13:42.913
No, Morgan. It's a feminist protest.

13:43.091 --> 13:45.719
Way to go, sister. Burn your bra.

13:45.894 --> 13:49.057
Yeah, well, if I did,
you could see the smoke in Baltimore.

13:49.231 --> 13:51.699
Sabrina, how did you do all of this?

13:51.866 --> 13:53.959
Uh, mostly wire hangers
and Styrofoam peanuts.

13:54.135 --> 13:55.796
So how was the date
with the drummer?

13:55.971 --> 13:58.997
Well, Clive was old enough
to be my grandfather.

13:59.174 --> 14:01.369
And short enough
to be Roxie's grandfather.

14:01.543 --> 14:03.443
But he turned out to be
a really nice guy.

14:03.612 --> 14:07.104
We had lots of fun. And he gave us
free preview copies of his solo CD.

14:07.282 --> 14:09.978
<i>Yeah, it's nothing but drumming.
It's called Buh-Dump-Bump Chsss.</i>

14:10.552 --> 14:12.179
Anyway,
Clive has this amazing background

14:12.354 --> 14:14.720
<i>and we thought
he'd be a great subject for Scorch.</i>

14:14.889 --> 14:15.913
I don't know, guys.

14:17.659 --> 14:19.593
I don't know people
that are interested in a story

14:19.761 --> 14:22.491
about a wrinkly old drummer
who's gone solo. Hello?

14:22.664 --> 14:24.723
Where the hell did that pencil roll,
Poughkeepsie?

14:24.899 --> 14:26.730
Oh, I'm sorry to disappear like that,

14:26.901 --> 14:32.396
but I am hot on the trail of a great story
about an old drummer.

14:33.608 --> 14:34.939
I'll be in later.

14:35.110 --> 14:36.907
If I dig myself any deeper
I'm gonna hit rice.

14:37.078 --> 14:39.308
You weren't lying.
We told Clive to meet us at the diner.

14:39.481 --> 14:40.880
So you really can write that story.

14:41.049 --> 14:43.142
Guys, I really don't feel
like going out like this.

14:43.318 --> 14:44.478
Are you kidding?

14:44.653 --> 14:47.781
If I had figure like that,
I'd want to show it off.

14:47.956 --> 14:50.857
Heck, I'd be married
to an 80-year-old billionaire by now.

14:51.726 --> 14:53.091
But we are only going to the diner,

14:53.261 --> 14:55.752
and I don't think they're gonna get
the statement you're making.

14:55.930 --> 14:58.592
Okay, well,
I'll just change my clothes.

15:01.536 --> 15:04.403
- Is something wrong, Sabrina?
- No, no, no, Roxie.

15:04.572 --> 15:06.369
I cannot give in
and not make this statement.

15:06.541 --> 15:08.509
That's just want the man wants.
Let's go.

15:11.880 --> 15:15.441
Oh, she's got what the man wants.

15:20.055 --> 15:23.047
I don't see Clive.
He must be on his way.

15:23.224 --> 15:25.954
Oh, great, Stan's working. I hope
you're not in a hurry to get served.

15:26.127 --> 15:30.063
Good afternoon, miss.
Let me get you a table right away.

15:31.299 --> 15:33.893
All right, come on,
you guys are done. Let's go.

15:34.069 --> 15:36.765
Up to, up to. The mayo
on your tuna's starting to turn.

15:36.938 --> 15:38.371
Ladies?

15:39.741 --> 15:41.072
So something to start?

15:41.242 --> 15:43.039
Uh, three lemonades, please?

15:43.211 --> 15:45.008
I'll squeeze them myself.

15:45.180 --> 15:46.511
Wow, what got into him?

15:46.681 --> 15:48.546
What got into him
is what got into you.

15:48.717 --> 15:50.708
I don't think
he's getting the irony of your outfit.

15:50.885 --> 15:54.116
Well, on the upside,
he's getting our order, and fast.

15:54.289 --> 15:55.347
Here we go.

15:55.523 --> 15:56.785
Oh, we didn't order lattes.

15:56.958 --> 15:58.152
No, these were sent over.

15:58.326 --> 16:01.056
From the gentleman at the counter,
another from the guy by the window,

16:01.229 --> 16:03.789
and the third
from the woman in the hard hat.

16:04.766 --> 16:05.824
Cool.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.901
Uh-uh. They're for the blond.

16:09.504 --> 16:13.133
For your information,
I am a blond in here.

16:13.308 --> 16:15.276
The only reason
you're getting all this free stuff

16:15.443 --> 16:16.967
is because of the way you look?

16:17.145 --> 16:19.773
I know. It's an outrage.

16:22.150 --> 16:23.344
What are you doing?

16:23.518 --> 16:29.218
Oh, uh, exploiting, um, gender politics
to get a free muffin.

16:31.793 --> 16:33.283
Sorry I'm late, ladies.

16:33.461 --> 16:37.227
At the last minute,
I realized I had something in my teeth.

16:37.399 --> 16:39.367
So I had to go back
and get the other set.

16:40.902 --> 16:42.733
Now, where is that writer?

16:43.138 --> 16:44.696
This is her. Sabrina Spellman.

16:44.873 --> 16:48.809
No, no, no. I meant the journalist
who's going to write that story on me.

16:48.977 --> 16:51.969
That would be me. Why don't we start
with background information?

16:52.147 --> 16:54.672
Fine, Goldilocks.

16:54.849 --> 16:59.013
I was born in London.
That's a big, big city in England.

16:59.487 --> 17:01.250
Yeah, I know where London is.
I've been there.

17:01.423 --> 17:05.757
Really? What, were they opening
a Trafalgar Square branch of Hooters?

17:05.926 --> 17:08.191
- Ha, ha.
- I'm treating you like a professional,

17:08.363 --> 17:10.126
I expect you
to treat me like a professional.

17:10.298 --> 17:14.165
Oh, you're a professional.
Well, that explains the dress.

17:14.335 --> 17:16.769
That's it.
You are way out of line, buddy.

17:16.938 --> 17:18.371
I'm really sorry, Sabrina.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.132
We had no idea
he'd be so obnoxious.

17:20.508 --> 17:21.599
Well, I don't know.

17:21.776 --> 17:24.074
Everything sounds so cute
with that accent.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.837
Just because I have a great body

17:26.013 --> 17:27.982
doesn't mean
I also don't have a great brain.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.344
I mean, look at this woman.

17:30.518 --> 17:32.850
It isn't fair that she's ignored
because she's not glamorous

17:33.021 --> 17:34.579
and her hair is limp and lifeless.

17:34.756 --> 17:36.451
And sure,
she could use a little concealer

17:36.624 --> 17:38.216
and control top pantyhose
wouldn't hurt.

17:38.393 --> 17:39.417
For the love of God, stop.

17:40.094 --> 17:41.857
I'm so sorry,
but you didn't let me finish.

17:42.030 --> 17:44.828
This woman isn't gorgeous doesn't
mean she doesn't have a lot to offer.

17:44.999 --> 17:47.968
I mean, we have to stop judging others
by the what they look on the surface.

17:48.136 --> 17:51.264
It's what underneath that matters,
not what's neath.

17:56.144 --> 17:57.475
I like you.

17:57.645 --> 18:00.079
When you're angry you jiggle.

18:02.817 --> 18:07.083
Nice speech.
Strident, with just a touch of hypocrisy.

18:07.255 --> 18:09.189
You're right. I owe you an apology.

18:09.357 --> 18:11.018
I shouldn't have assumed
you're dating Tina

18:11.192 --> 18:12.216
because she's gorgeous.

18:12.393 --> 18:14.384
She probably challenges you
intellectually as well.

18:14.562 --> 18:17.531
Look at the sign.
They spelled dinner with one N.

18:19.501 --> 18:20.991
But sometimes
if a book's cover says,

18:21.169 --> 18:24.400
<i>"An Idiot's Guide for Dummies,"
you gotta take it at face value.</i>

18:27.609 --> 18:30.635
Man, I gotta get the name
of that shampoo.

18:32.814 --> 18:35.715
Okay, I've had enough
of this Jessica Rabbit impersonation.

18:35.884 --> 18:37.852
Oh, I'm ready to get back
to my old self.

18:38.219 --> 18:39.584
I just wish I knew how.

18:39.754 --> 18:41.813
Oh, Harvey, knows his way
around a computer.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.480
He could put you back
the way you were.

18:43.658 --> 18:47.219
But allow me to point out,
you look mighty, mighty...

18:51.132 --> 18:55.159
- Sabrina, you're...
- Yeah, I know, mighty, mighty.

18:55.336 --> 18:57.429
Look, I can't stand looking like this
for another day,

18:57.605 --> 18:59.505
you obviously
have a hockey game to get back to.

18:59.674 --> 19:03.166
No, they won't miss me.
There's a fight going on.

19:03.344 --> 19:04.971
Oh, so you were hiding
in the penalty box?

19:05.647 --> 19:07.979
They hit so hard.

19:08.149 --> 19:09.878
Anyway,
you're the one with the magic powers,

19:10.051 --> 19:11.416
how am I supposed to help you?

19:13.588 --> 19:15.078
Okay, I'm gonna go
inside your computer

19:15.256 --> 19:17.281
and you can use PhotoTweek
to get me back to normal.

19:18.359 --> 19:19.519
You positive?

19:19.694 --> 19:21.594
This is what I'm saying.

19:23.898 --> 19:26.799
Okay, here goes.

19:27.168 --> 19:30.103
<i>Listen, Harvey, as long as
I'm in here, I miss the beauty mark.</i>

19:30.271 --> 19:32.068
<i>Could you put it back?</i>

19:33.875 --> 19:35.536
- But you don't understand.
- No, I don't.

19:35.710 --> 19:37.302
Why did you put cameras
in the men's room?

19:37.478 --> 19:39.139
You're lucky
we're not getting a lawsuit.

19:39.314 --> 19:41.839
I want all webcams
disconnected immediately,

19:42.016 --> 19:45.179
and I want that limerick about me
erased off the wall.

19:45.653 --> 19:47.314
Fine, I'll get rid of the webcams.

19:47.488 --> 19:51.015
But someday, you will be
slack-jawed in awe of my genius.

19:54.295 --> 19:55.887
Pull.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.531
Thank you.

19:57.865 --> 19:59.389
Oh.

20:01.569 --> 20:02.593
What do you want?

20:02.770 --> 20:05.330
You're probably wondering
why I looked so outrageous yesterday.

20:05.506 --> 20:08.771
Well, actually I was working
on a story about body image.

20:08.943 --> 20:11.741
I assumed you were trying to draw
attention away from your writing.

20:12.614 --> 20:15.048
The point is,
I'm back with my peasant blouses,

20:15.216 --> 20:16.774
and sensible shoes.

20:16.951 --> 20:18.976
This is the way I look
and you have to deal with it.

20:19.153 --> 20:20.745
You were the one
having a hard time.

20:20.922 --> 20:22.412
First the cameras
are freaking you out,

20:22.590 --> 20:24.251
then you get all Dolly Partoned
up in here,

20:24.425 --> 20:26.290
and now you've got this
bizarre tattoo going on.

20:27.495 --> 20:31.864
Oh, well, you know
the peer pressure at computer camp.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.762
Believe me,
working in the music industry,

20:33.935 --> 20:35.766
I have seen far, far stranger things.

20:35.937 --> 20:38.633
Now, where is this drummer article
that you're so hot about?

20:39.607 --> 20:41.165
Oh. Ha, ha.

20:41.643 --> 20:44.043
Oh, I dropped my pencil.

20:44.212 --> 20:46.578
Oh, it's still rolling.

20:47.115 --> 20:48.946
Still rolling.

20:56.391 --> 20:59.155
Nice shoes. Are those Prada?

20:59.327 --> 21:01.625
Oh, they're knockoffs. Fraud-a.

21:01.796 --> 21:04.993
The wedgie style
really shows off your arches.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.533
And the strap,
hugs the curve of your instep.

21:09.637 --> 21:12.231
Has anyone ever told you
you have stunning toe cleavage?

21:12.840 --> 21:14.398
No. Thanks.

21:19.113 --> 21:20.910
Leonard, hand that over.
